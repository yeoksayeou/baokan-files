    A Competition That Started This Way
    By Our Correspondent Cao Baoming

    A challenge notice was posted in front of the Industrial Installation Team No. 1's canteen: The Gong Youmin welding team is determined to surpass the Li Huanbo team in the welding competition on the steelmaking site! This kind of challenge from one team to another is a common occurrence. However, this particular challenge notice sparked endless discussions in the canteen and dormitories.

    The reason for everyone's great interest was that the Li Huanbo team was the most famous Red Flag welding team in Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO). After receiving the title of "Communist Group" during the construction of Blast Furnace No. 1, they consistently went wherever the conditions were the toughest, constantly overcoming difficulties and continuously creating new achievements. The Li Huanbo team was always indispensable at the Wuhan city advanced producers conferences, and they also attended the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference in Beijing. The Gong Youmin team, on the other hand? Apart from Gong Youmin himself, who was a 26-year-old Grade 6 worker, the rest were all Grade 3 or 4 workers around 20 years old. When they arrived at Blast Furnace No. 2 in early March this year, their low skill and lack of experience made them the "weakest link." They were entirely dependent on the timely assistance of the Li Huanbo team to avoid impacting the overall construction progress. Now, six months later, this "weakest link" was going to surpass the most advanced team! What would they use to surpass them?

    The story must be told from the beginning.

            Assistance

    During the battle to install Blast Furnace No. 2 in March, the Gong Youmin team began welding the furnace body (including hot blast stoves), which required particularly strict quality. Before this, they had only welded some auxiliary projects such as stair railings and hopper funnels. They had only recently obtained the "Blast Furnace Welder Qualification Certificate," and they happened to encounter the battle to install three 40-meter-high hot blast stoves. At that time, it wasn't their turn to let these novices go into battle. Thanks to Li Huanbo, who had just returned from a meeting in Beijing, who made a suggestion: "One team cannot build a whole WISCO! Let the novices go up and train this time, and we'll do the odd jobs." The young men were so excited that they didn't sleep well all night, determined to do a great job.

    However, they encountered difficulties as soon as they went up. At a little after seven in the morning, when they pulled ten welding machines up to Hot Blast Stove No. 1, Deputy Leader Lei Xiaoquan (Gong Youmin was away on business) was still calculating: "The previous two teams welded a total of three rings, we must weld at least one and a half rings." Who knew that by noon, they hadn't even welded half a ring, and the hoisting workers had already installed two rings of 12-meter diameter, 6-meter high furnace shells on Hot Blast Stoves No. 2 and No. 3. The huge tower crane had already hooked a ring of furnace shell, but because they hadn't finished welding, it couldn't be hoisted up. Immediately, Captain Dong was anxious and went up to understand the situation, and the propaganda team also sent up a "Key Report": "Hoisting speed is as fast as flying, welding should also closely follow, welders, weld hard, fast installation and fast welding fly wing to wing!" At this time, although Lei Xiaoquan and the others were full of enthusiasm, they just lacked experience and couldn't weld fast. The plan to install three furnace bodies in seven days was about to be delayed in their hands!

    At this critical moment, Li Huanbo led three workers to provide assistance. When he went up to the hot blast stove and heard that the fastest welding was four hours per ring, while hoisting installed two rings in more than four hours, he muttered to himself, "We have to think of another way." He turned and went to discuss with Captain Dong.

    The Red Flag team was truly worthy of its reputation. Li Huanbo and Captain Dong returned to the scaffolding and proposed the "four-sided tack welding" suggestion. Immediately, four welding machines were pulled over and tested on Furnace No. 2. The huge furnace shell was aligned with the center line, and four welders welded the welding rods in the four corners with a swoosh, swoosh, swoosh sound. The tower crane's large boom swung left and right in the air, but it couldn't move the furnace shell even half a point. This changed the procedure of having to weld the next ring before hoisting the previous ring. The furnace shell could be hoisted continuously!

    The next day, Li Huanbo brought all the team's workers to the hot blast stove to provide specific assistance to Lei Xiaoquan and the others, one after another. The novices were a little timid, turning the current down very low, which made them weld slowly and the quality was not ideal. They helped to turn up the current. The novices didn't know how to organize the workforce, and after welding a section, they would take a break to let the air shovel workers shovel the welding slag, wasting less than eight hours of work per shift. They helped to organize assembly line operations, with welding and air shoveling working at the same time, not wasting a single second. Some even personally welded a section, not only was the welding meat full and firm, but also the welding wave pressed wave, like fish scales, very beautiful, and then let the novices operate in the same way... Lei Xiaoquan and the others were extremely moved at the time. After getting off work, they returned to the dormitory to hold a meeting to summarize their experiences and reorganize their work. As a result, they adopted the experience of the Li Huanbo team and welded two rings of furnace shell in one shift, reaching the advanced level of the entire team. The three hot blast stoves were also installed in four days and nineteen hours, exceeding the speed of Blast Furnace No. 1 by 1.8 times.

    From then on, they also took the Li Huanbo team as an example, "Learn from Huanbo, catch up with Huanbo."

          Learning

    The biggest feature of the Li Huanbo team is that they don't care about remuneration for labor, don't talk about conditions for work, are not afraid of difficulties, and don't avoid hardships, their communist style is high. When the Gong Youmin team went to support the sintering plant project, they also set four "do" conditions: do it whenever needed; do it wherever it is difficult; think of ways to do it in wind and rain; and do it even if it is not their profession.

    At that time, the huge sintering plant was implementing simultaneous construction and installation, multi-layer cross-parallel assembly line operations, and construction was very tight. As soon as the civil engineering workers built the platform, even without walls or roofs, the installation workers immediately entered the site to work. There were eight levels working simultaneously from the top of the 40-meter-high house. Many tasks were assigned the night before and had to be completed the next morning.

    Not long after they arrived, Riveting Team Leader Sha Yefa came to them: "There are still 34 rings of 1.6-meter chimney that have not been welded, and they must be installed tomorrow morning. You guys go and rush to do it tonight." Lei Xiaoquan immediately said: "Okay, we'll pull two welding machines up." Sha Yefa calculated: "Thirty-four rings of weld seams are nearly 200 meters long. One shift welds about 20 meters. How can two welding machines weld it in 16 hours?" He was a little disbelieving. Gong Youmin then called Chen Dehua and Xiao Yefu to take a bag of 40 kilograms of welding rods up. The two young men looked at the chimney situation and began to discuss: "Can we use the double-handed multi-rod welding method?" "Okay, let's try it." The two immediately took welding rods in their left hands and held the welding handle in their right hands, turning up the current. They saw arc light flashing, and the welding speed greatly increased. When it was about to dawn, Gong Youmin also rushed up to help them for a while.

    A little after seven in the morning, the three sat on the platform to rest. When 21-year-old Chen Dehua saw Sha Yefa walking towards them, he lit the fire and pretended to still be welding. When the honest Sha Yefa saw the arc light, he shouted from afar: "Still not finished welding? It will affect the installation." But when he went up and took a closer look, everything was welded properly, he was immediately excited and shook hands with them one by one, and immediately posted a big-character poster on the chimney praising them: "The Gong Youmin team is not simple, their enthusiasm breaks through the nine heavens, they welded 200 meters overnight, completing two days of work in one night!"

    One windy and rainy night, Piping Team Leader Su Wenjian delivered a temporary task: all 105 pipe openings of the factory's upper and lower water pipes must be welded tonight, and pressure must be tested at eight o'clock tomorrow morning. Lei Xiaoquan was also taken aback at the time: these pipe openings are distributed above and below the 40-meter-high factory building, there are very few electric lights, and there is no scaffolding, how can they be welded in one night? Su Wenjian said: "Should we get temporary mobile ladders?" "Okay, we'll hang our safety belts tighter." "What about lighting?" Lei Xiaoquan said: "We have a new method, the welding handle clamp comes with a light." The whole team immediately held a meeting on the construction site and decided to work hard all night to complete the urgent task.

    At night, Ruan Mingli went to work on three pipes hanging more than 20 meters high. The rain soaked him so that he couldn't see anything even when he put on the mask. He simply took off the mask, holding a black glass plate in one hand, holding the welding handle clamp in the other, and using his body to block the wind and rain. They worked like this all night, and the upper and lower water pipes were pressure tested on time the next day. The quality also reached excellent. The work section immediately beat gongs and drums to send them good news.

    In the company's second-quarter award evaluation, they were given a banner, calling them a "team with a communist style."

        Dare to Surpass or Not?

    The 28 projects of the steelmaking site were all under construction at the same time. Everywhere were steel columns standing tall, iron pipes crisscrossing, everywhere needed welding. The Li Huanbo team, which had been transferred here from the blast furnace, was still doing a great job at this time.

    The Gong Youmin team was transferred to the steelmaking site to be responsible for welding the No. 2 settling chamber. Gong Youmin proposed in the team: "This time the construction site is carrying out a competition, we should think of ways to surpass the Li Huanbo team's record." As soon as the words came out, the young men began to argue excitedly. Some said: "Let's post the challenge notice immediately and guarantee to surpass them!" Some said: "This is not good. Their team has the strongest welding force in the whole company. Everyone only mentions learning from Huanbo and catching up with Huanbo, no one mentions surpassing Huanbo, dare we mention it?" Dare to surpass or not? Everyone couldn't make up their minds. Lei Xiaoquan went to ask Party Branch Secretary He, and Secretary He said at the time: "Dare to surpass, why don't we dare to surpass? Surpassing the advanced is not to overthrow the advanced, but to learn from each other and improve together." The secretary of the Youth League branch next to him immediately picked up a pen and added three words to their challenge letter: "Surpass Huanbo!"

    After the challenge notice was posted, they themselves became nervous. They quickly held a meeting in the dormitory and decided to carry out a competition between shifts and individuals within the team to ensure that they exceeded the team's Great Leap Forward target. The first day Lei Xiaoquan went to work, he found that when the current was increased and the welding rod was burned red, the welding medicine easily fell off, reducing welding efficiency. He thought of changing it to replacing the welding rod immediately after it turned red, and then replacing it for use after the red welding rod cooled down. In this way, the welding rods were not wasted, but they welded faster and better. He welded 32 meters in one shift. The whole team immediately promoted this experience, and Chen Dehua reached 36 meters that night, keeping pace with the famous Li Huanbo team, causing a sensation on the steelmaking site.

          Two Miracles

    The Li Huanbo Red Flag team, which had never encountered an opponent, suddenly became nervous at this time, and sent their female apprentice Qiao Zhenlan, who had entered the site in May this year, to take the blast furnace welder exam in advance. The workers all knew very well that the technical requirements of blast furnace welding were particularly strict. Not only must they know general flat welding, but also horizontal welding, vertical welding, and overhead welding. When welding 40-meter-thick steel plates, they must guarantee in quality: the steel plate is broken, the weld seam is not broken; folded 180 degrees, the weld seam does not crack. To reach such a high technical level, it used to be necessary to undergo five years of practical training. However, this 19-year-old girl, who had just come from the countryside, passed the "Blast Furnace Welder Qualification Certificate" with excellent results after only four and a half months of study, becoming a rare miracle!

    What kind of miracle could the Gong Youmin team create to compete with the Li Huanbo team? While they were studying this question, the metal structure factory called and asked them to immediately send people to weld steel ladles. Lei Xiaoquan immediately led six workers to rush over.

    The night he went there, he saw Soviet expert team leader Badurov and several experts watching the steel ladle. This thing was five meters high, 4.4 meters in diameter, and standing on the ground it was about to hit the crane on the beam. The deputy section chief of the factory's production section said to him: "Guys, do a good job! The expert just said that steel ladles have always been riveted. There is a 200-ton welded steel ladle in Anshan Iron and Steel. Ours is 270 tons, if we do it well, it will be a great miracle!"

    Indeed, don't look at it as a steel ladle, just welding two steel hoops will use one ton of welding rods. Looking at this behemoth, Lei Xiaoquan thought that the design stipulated that ten welding machines should stand and weld the steel hoops, first welding the upper hoop, and then turning it over to weld the lower hoop. This thing is almost as high as the crane, turning it over is not simple, if you are not careful, you will damage the ladle opening. He thought about it and suggested laying the steel ladle flat and welding machines symmetrically welding on both sides. In this way, the steel ladle can roll, making it easy to turn over, and the quality of symmetrical welding is also better. The factory held several technical meetings and adopted his suggestion. In this way, they welded two steel hoops in four days, and the quality was rated as excellent after optical inspection and ultrasonic inspection.

    The night before the steel ladle left the factory, the film studio invited expert team leader Badurov to film the scene for the "Great Friendship" film. Badurov asked Lei Xiaoquan: "How many people did you bring? What grade are they?" Lei Xiaoquan replied: "Seven people came, all Grade 3 and 4." The technical authority, who had won five medals in the Soviet Union, raised his thumb and said: "Very good!"

    Now, these two teams have completed the welding tasks of the steelmaking project and have gone to new construction sites separately. However, their competition has just begun and has not ended.

    这样开始的一场竞赛
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    工业安装一队的饭堂门前贴出了一张战表：龚友民电焊组决心在炼钢工地开展的对手赛中超过厉焕波组！这个组向那个组挑战，本是桩平常事儿。但是，这张战表却引得人们在饭堂、宿舍里议论不休。
    大家兴趣这样大的原因是：厉焕波组是武钢最著名的红旗电焊组，他们在一号高炉建设中获得“共产主义小组”的称号以后，始终是哪里艰苦就到哪里去，处处战胜困难，不断创造新成就。武汉市每次举行先进生产者大会，都少不了他们；北京召开全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会，也有他们参加。龚友民这个组呢？除他本人二十六岁，是个六级工以外，全都是二十岁上下的三、四级工。他们今年3月初上二号高炉，便因为技术低，经验差，成了“最弱的一环”，全亏厉焕波组及时帮了他们一把，才没有影响整个建设进度。现在，时隔半年，这“最弱的一环”竟要超过最先进的小组！他们用什么去超过呢？
    事情得从头说起。
            援助
    在3月安装二号高炉的战斗中，龚友民组才开始焊接质量要求特别严格的高炉（包括热风炉）炉体。在这以前，他们焊的都是楼梯栏杆、料仓漏斗等一些附属工程。他们刚考取“高炉电焊工合格证”不久，正碰上安装三座四十米高的大热风炉的战役，当时，是轮不到他们这些新手上阵的。亏得刚从北京开会回来的厉焕波提了个建议：“一个组建不起一座武钢！这次让新手上去锻炼锻炼，我们去干零星杂活。”小伙子们兴奋得一夜没有睡好，决心美美地大干一番。
    但是，他们一上去就遇到了困难。早晨七点多钟，他们将十台焊机拉上一号热风炉时，副组长雷孝全（龚友民出差了）还在盘算：“前两个组一共焊了三圈，我们最少也要焊它一圈半。”谁知到了中午，他们还没焊好半圈，吊装工便将两圈十二米直径、六米高的大炉壳安上二号、三号热风炉了。巨大的塔式吊机已将一圈炉壳钩好，只是因为他们没有焊完，不能往上吊装。顿时急得董队长连忙上去了解情况，宣传组也送上去一张“关键报”：“吊装速度快如飞，电焊也应紧跟随，焊工同志加油焊，快装快焊比翼飞！”这时，尽管雷孝全他们个个干劲冲天，可就是缺乏经验，怎么也焊不快。七天安好三座炉体的计划，眼看着就要耽误在他们手里！
    就在这个关键时刻，厉焕波领着三个工人来支援了。他上得热风炉，听说电焊最快四个小时焊一圈，而吊装四个多小时安了两圈，便自言自语地说：“得另想办法才行。”转身找董队长研究去了。
    人家红旗小组真是名不虚传，厉焕波同董队长回到脚手架上来，便提出了“四边点焊”的建议，立即拉去四台焊机，在二号炉上进行试验。庞大的炉壳一对正中心线，四名焊工便在四角上唰唰唰焊上焊条。塔式吊机的大扒杆在空中左右摆动，也不能将炉壳拉动半分。这样，就改变了必须焊好下一圈才能吊装上一圈的程序，炉壳可以不断地往上吊装！
    第二天，厉焕波又把全组工人开上热风炉来，一个跟一个，对雷孝全他们进行具体帮助。新手们有些胆怯，将电流开得很小，既焊的慢，质量也不理想。他们便帮助将电流调大。新手们不会组织劳动力，焊完一段就歇下来让风铲工铲焊渣，一班焊不了八小时活。他们便帮助组织流水作业，电焊和风铲同时工作，不让浪费一分一秒时间。有的还亲自焊上一段，不仅焊肉饱满很牢实，而且焊的一波压一波，像鱼鳞似的，非常美观，然后再让新手照样操作……雷孝全他们当时感动极了，一下班就回宿舍开会总结经验，重新组织工作。结果，他们采用厉焕波组的经验，一班就焊了两圈炉壳，达到全队的先进水平。三座热风炉也用四天十九小时安装完毕，超过一号高炉的速度一点八倍。
    从此，他们也就以厉焕波组为榜样，“学焕波，赶焕波”。
          学习
    厉焕波组最大的特点，在于他们劳动不计报酬，工作不讲条件，不惧困难，不避艰苦，共产主义风格高。龚友民组去支援烧结厂工程时，也订出了个“四干”条件：啥时需要啥时干；哪里艰苦哪里干；刮风下雨想法干；不是本行也要干。
    那时候，巨大的烧结厂正在实行建筑与安装并进和多层交叉平行流水作业，施工非常紧张。土建工人刚筑起平台，连墙壁、屋顶都没有，安装工人马上就进场工作。从四十多米高的房上往下排，有八层在同时施工。许多任务头天晚上才派下来，第二天早晨就要交工。
    他们刚去不久，铆工组长沙也发便找他们：“一米六的烟筒，还有三十四圈没焊好，明天早晨就要安装，你们今天夜里去突击一下。”雷孝全马上说：“行呀，我们拉两台焊机上去。”沙也发计算了一下：“三十四圈焊缝将近二百米，一个台班焊二十来米，两台焊机怎能在十六小时里焊完？”有些不相信。龚友民当时便叫陈德华、萧也富带着一包四十公斤重的焊条上去。两个小伙子看了看烟筒情况，便研究开了：“能不能用双手多条焊接法？”“行呀，试一试。”两人立即左手拿焊条，右手持焊把，开大电流，只见弧光闪闪，焊接速度大大加快。天快明时，龚友民又赶上去帮了他们一阵。
    早晨七点多钟，三人坐在平台上休息。二十一岁的陈德华见沙也发正向这里走来，便点着火，装做还在焊接的样子。忠厚的沙也发一见弧光，老远就喊开了：“还没焊完？可要影响安装了。”但是当他上去仔细一看，全都焊得妥妥贴贴的时候，顿时就激动得跟他们一一握手，又马上在烟筒上贴出表扬的大字报：“龚友民组不简单，干劲冲破九重天，一夜烧焊二百米，两天工作一夜完！”
    一个风雨之夜，管工组长苏文俭交来一个临时任务：全厂上下水管的一百零五个管口，必须在今夜全部焊好，明天早晨八点试压。雷孝全当时也吃了一惊：这些管口分布在四十多米高的厂房上下，电灯很少，还没有脚手架，怎么能在一夜焊完？苏文俭说：“是不是搞临时活动梯？”“行呀，我们把安全带挂好些。”“照明怎么办呢？”雷孝全说：“我们有个新办法，电焊把钳上自带电灯。”全组立即在工地上开会，决定大干一夜，完成紧急任务。
    入夜，阮明礼去悬空二十多米高的三根管道上工作，雨水淋得他戴上面罩就啥也看不清，他就干脆卸下面罩，一手拿着黑色玻璃片，一手掌着电焊把钳，再用身体挡住风雨，他们这样干了一个通宵，上下水管第二天就按时试压了。质量也达到优等。工段立即敲锣打鼓给他们送来喜报。
    公司第二季评奖，给了他们一面奖旗，称他们做：“具有共产主义风格的小组”。
        敢超不敢超？
    炼钢工地的二十八项工程都在同时施工。到处是钢柱林立、铁管纵横，到处需要焊接。从高炉转来这里的厉焕波组，这时依然干得挺出色。
    龚友民组调到炼钢工地，负责焊二号沉渣室。龚友民就在组里提出：“这次工地开展对手赛，咱们应该想办法超过厉焕波组的纪录。”话刚出口，小伙子们便兴奋地争论起来。有的说：“我们马上把战表贴出去，保证超过他们！”有的说：“这样不好。全公司就数他们队的电焊力量强。大家都只提学焕波，赶焕波，没有提超焕波的，我们敢提？”究竟敢超不敢超？大家都拿不定主意。雷孝全去问党总支何书记，何书记当时就说：“敢超呀，怎么不敢超？超过先进，并不是打倒先进，而是为了互相学习，共同提高。”旁边的团支部书记马上就提笔在他们的挑战书上加了三字：“超焕波！”
    挑战书一张贴出去，他们自己倒紧张起来了。他们连忙在宿舍开会，决定在组内开展班与班、人与人的对手赛，保证超过组里的跃进指标。雷孝全头天上班，发现电流加大，焊条烧红后，焊药容易脱落，焊接效率降低。他想法改为焊条一红就立即换新焊条，等红焊条冷却后，再换上使用。这样，焊条并不浪费，却焊得又快又好。他一个班就焊了三十二米。全组马上推广这项经验，陈德华在当天夜里就达到三十六米，与著名的厉焕波组并驾齐驱，在炼钢工地轰动一时。
          两个奇迹
    从来没有遇到对手的厉焕波红旗小组，这时不觉紧张起来，便提前将今年5月进场的女徒工乔振兰送去考高炉电焊工。工人都很清楚，高炉电焊的技术要求特别严。不仅要会一般的平焊，还要会横焊、立焊、仰焊。焊接四十米毛厚的钢板，必须在质量上保证：钢板拉断，焊缝不断；折叠一百八十度，焊缝不裂。要达到这样高的技术水平，过去必须经过五年操作锻炼。但是，这个新从农村来的十九岁的姑娘，在他们精心培养下，只经过四个半月的学习，就以优等成绩考取了“高炉电焊工合格证”，成为一件罕见的奇迹！
    龚友民组可以创造什么样的奇迹，同厉焕波组比赛呢？他们正在研究这个问题，金属结构厂打来电话，要他们立即派人去焊接钢水罐。雷孝全立即领着六个工人赶去。
    他去的那天晚上，见苏联专家组长巴杜洛夫同志和几个专家正在观看钢水罐。这家伙有五米高、四米四的直径，立在地上就快顶着梁上的行车。厂里的生产科副科长向他说：“伙计，好好干呀！专家刚才讲了，钢水罐从来都是铆接的。焊接的钢水罐，在鞍钢有个二百吨的。我们这个却有二百七十吨，干好了就是一大奇迹！”
    的确，别看它是个钢水罐，光是焊接两圈钢箍，就要用一吨焊条。雷孝全看着这庞然大物，便想到设计上规定由十台焊机立着焊钢箍，先焊上半箍，再翻个个儿焊下半箍。这家伙快跟行车一般高，翻个个儿可不简单，稍不注意就会将罐口撞坏。他想了想，就建议将钢水罐放平躺着，焊机分在两边对称焊。这样，钢水罐能滚动，翻身容易，对称焊的质量也好些。厂里开了几次技术会议，采纳了他的建议。这样，他们四天就将两圈钢箍焊好，经过光学检验和超声波检验，质量都评为优等。
    钢水罐出厂的头天晚上，电影制片厂邀请专家组长巴杜洛夫前来拍摄“伟大的友谊”影片的镜头。巴杜洛夫问雷孝全：“你们来了几个人？都是几级工？”雷孝全回答说：“来了七个人，都是三级、四级。”这个在苏联得过五次勋章的技术权威，翘起拇指说：“好得很！”
    现在，这两个组已经完成炼钢工程的焊接任务，分头奔赴新的工地。不过，他们的竞赛才刚开始，并没有结束。
