The Victory of Large Enterprises Engaging in Mass Movements
    Synthetic Ammonia Production Doubled at Lanzhou Chemical Plant
    Production Level in Seven Months Exceeds Design Capacity by More Than Double
    (Our newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch on the 23rd) The Lanzhou Chemical Plant, a large enterprise with a high degree of automation and modernization, has broken the mysterious view of "foreign" enterprises by launching a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution. This has doubled the production of synthetic ammonia, the plant's main product, compared to its original design capacity, essentially turning one plant into two, and achieving a great leap forward.

    The Lanzhou Chemical Plant is a newly built large enterprise with complex processes and strong production continuity. It officially went into production on March 16th this year. Synthetic ammonia, the main product of the plant, is a chemical raw material urgently needed by the state, and also a raw material for fertilizer urgently needed to increase grain production. In May of this year, the chemical plant's Party committee, in order to increase the production of synthetic ammonia, put forward a mobilization call to double the production of synthetic ammonia compared to the design capacity. The plant's tens of thousands of employees were full of spirit and high in morale. After full research, they focused on the weak links in production and made great efforts in technical innovation, which brought about tremendous changes in the face of production. They successively implemented ninety reform projects, spending only 1.5% of the original investment in the synthetic ammonia system, 6% of the steel, and less than one-third of the time, to achieve the plan of spending less money, achieving faster results, doubling production, and turning one plant into two. The daily output of synthetic ammonia broke through the 300-ton mark from October 28th, more than doubling the original design capacity of 146.4 tons per day.

    The miracle of Lanzhou Chemical Plant doubling the production of synthetic ammonia without increasing the number of employees, only supplementing a small amount of equipment, is the result of the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the result of promoting the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, the result of sweeping away all right-leaning thoughts, greatly boosting revolutionary vigor, launching mass movements, making great efforts in the technical revolution, and promoting the communist style of cooperation under the great call and encouragement of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.

    In May of this year, when the Lanzhou Chemical Plant Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to double the production of synthetic ammonia compared to the design capacity, it encountered resistance from various right-leaning thoughts. Some people believed that: Lanzhou Chemical Plant has only been built and put into production for a few months, the technology and equipment are first-class, but the people using such equipment are all new workers, with an average technical level of less than grade two, and the efficiency of chemical equipment (compressors) can only be发挥 80%; Others believe that: modern large-scale chemical plants are the newest type, the design level is already very advanced, and it is not very possible to make another leap forward in production; Others seized on the fact that the chemical plant failed to complete the production plan and had individual accidents when it was first put into production, believing that: the main task of the chemical plant is to master new technologies and steadily improve production. They said: The production plan has not yet been completed, so how can we talk about increasing production? Accidents are still difficult to avoid, so how can we talk about innovation? In a word, these people lacked confidence in doubling production. The chemical plant's Party committee resolutely resisted this "right-leaning wind." On the one hand, it mobilized employees to use the methods of extensive airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters to sweep away evil spirits. On the other hand, it adopted the method of combining leading cadres, technicians, and workers to conduct a comprehensive survey of production, check the causes of abnormal production, and widely seek advice and suggestions in workshops and sections. Employees throughout the plant posted tens of thousands of big-character posters, offering measures, finding loopholes, and contributing ideas, so that the leadership could sort out ninety major innovation projects from thousands of technical innovation suggestions and mobilize employees to conscientiously implement them. Among the eleven workshops in the plant's synthetic ammonia system, gas production, compression, conversion, and synthesis are the four main parts, and insufficient compression capacity is a weak link affecting the doubling of synthetic ammonia production. Because Lanzhou is located in a plateau with low air pressure, the compressor workshop's compressor capacity could not be fully utilized, so an additional compressor was set up compared to coastal and plain areas. The workers thought of ways based on this situation and added a supplementary cylinder to the compressor, using mechanical force to force it to increase the amount of gas. As a result, the capacity of each compressor increased by 18% compared to the original, and the five compressors in the entire workshop could top six. After the weak link was broken through, other links also carried out a series of innovations and actively caught up. The high-pressure oxygen blower in the gas production workshop could not keep up with the needs, so the employees used the methods of reducing pressure and increasing the amount of air to increase the capacity of each blower by one-third; The capacity of the conversion furnace could not keep up, so the workers thought of ways to innovate, increasing the capacity of each furnace by 50%, and using one as one and a half.

    In August, after the plant criticized right-leaning slackening emotions based on the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the plant's Party committee arranged three major campaigns, so that the plant's competition movement deepened one after another, and the production of synthetic ammonia rose step by step. At the same time, communist cooperation was also carried out throughout the plant. When the machinery branch plant manufactured supplementary cylinders and other equipment parts, the factory director and workers worked hard day and night in shifts, listing serving the doubled production of synthetic ammonia as the central work; The construction company took the four major technical measures for doubling as the primary task, completing each item on schedule and creating a new record for compressor installation. The catering staff also ensured that the food was hot and the dishes were fragrant, and personally delivered them to the production front. Therefore, the plant's plan to double the production of synthetic ammonia compared to the design capacity was realized ahead of schedule on October 28th. (Attached picture)

    大企业大搞群众运动的胜利
    兰州化工厂合成氨产量翻番
    投入生产七个月生产水平超过设计能力一倍以上
    本报兰州23日电　具有高度自动化、现代化生产水平的大型企业兰州化工厂，打破对“大洋”企业的神秘观点，开展技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，使全厂主要产品——合成氨的生产量比原设计能力增加了一倍，等于把一个厂变成两个厂，实现了大跃进。
    兰州化工厂是一座新建的大型企业，工艺复杂，生产连续性强，在今年3月16日正式投入生产。该厂生产的主要产品合成氨是国家迫切需要的化工原料，也是增产粮食急需要的化肥原料。今年5月，化工厂党委为了增产更多的合成氨，提出了让合成氨产量比设计能力翻一番的动员号召。全厂上万名职工意气风发，斗志昂扬，经过充分研究，针对生产中的薄弱环节，大闹技术革新，使生产面貌发生了巨大的变化。他们先后实现了九十条改革项目，总共只花了占原建设合成氨系统投资1.5％的资金，6％的钢材和不到三分之一的时间，就实现了花钱少、收效快、产量加一番、一厂变两厂的计划。合成氨日产量从10月28日起突破三百吨大关，比原设计能力日产一百四十六点四吨提高一倍。
    兰州化工厂在不增加职工、只补充少量设备，使合成氨产量翻一番的奇迹，是在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格的结果，是在党的八届八中全会伟大号召和鼓舞下、横扫一切右倾思想，大鼓革命干劲，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命和大兴共产主义协作之风的结果。
    今年5月，中共兰州化工厂委员会提出让合成氨产量比设计能力翻一番的号召时，曾遇到形形色色右倾思想的抵制。有人认为：兰州化工厂建成投入生产才短短几个月，技术设备是第一流的，然而使用这样设备的都是新工人，平均技术等级还不到二级，化工设备（压缩机）的工效只能发挥80％；也有人认为：现代化的大型化工厂是最新型的，设计水平已经很先进，生产再跃进不大可能；也有人抓住化工厂刚投入生产时，完不成生产计划和发生个别事故的事实，认为：化工厂的主要任务是掌握新技术，稳步提高生产，他们说：生产计划还完不成，谈何增产？事故还难于避免，谈何革新？一句话，这些人对产量翻番缺乏信心。化工厂党委坚决顶住了这股“右倾风”，一面发动职工用大鸣大放大辩论大字报的方法横扫邪气，一面采用领导干部、技术人员和工人三结合的办法，对生产进行全面摸底，检查生产不正常的原因，在工段、车间广泛求谋问计。全厂职工贴出成千上万张大字报，提措施、找漏洞，献计献策，使领导上得以从上千条技术革新建议中，整理出九十条重大革新项目，发动职工认真贯彻执行。全厂合成氨系统的十一个车间中造气、压缩、变换、合成是四个主要部分，其中压缩能力不足，是影响合成氨产量翻番的薄弱环节。压缩机车间因兰州地处高原、气压低，压缩机能力不能充分发挥作用，因而比沿海、平原地区多设了一台压缩机。工人们根据这一情况想办法，在压缩机上增加一个补充气缸，用机械力量迫使它增加气量，结果使每台压缩机的能力比原来增加了18％，全车间五台压缩机可顶六台用。薄弱环节突破后，其他环节也开展了一系列的革新，积极赶上去。造气车间高压氧气鼓风机赶不上需要，职工们就用减压、增加风量的办法，使每个鼓风机能力提高三分之一；变换炉能力赶不上，工人们想法革新，使每炉增加能力50％，一台顶一台半使用。
    8月份全厂根据党的八届八中全会精神批判右倾松劲情绪后，厂党委又安排了三大战役，使全厂的竞赛运动一个接一个深入展开下去，合成氨产量步步高升。与此同时，还在全厂范围内开展了共产主义大协作。机械分厂制造补充气缸和其他设备零件时，厂长和工人日夜轮班苦战，把为合成氨生产加番服务列为中心工作；建设公司把翻番的四大技术措施作为首要任务，件件按期完成，并创造了压缩机安装的新纪录，炊事人员也保证饭热菜香，亲自送到生产前线。因而全厂合成氨产量比设计能力翻一番的计划，比预订计划提前在10月28日实现了。（附图片）
