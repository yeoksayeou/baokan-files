Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 11th: The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in North Vietnam is now unfolding comprehensively after three batches of pilot programs.

As of the end of October this year, 646 industrial and commercial enterprises in the North had implemented joint state-private ownership, accounting for 30% of the total number of capitalist industrial and commercial households. Among these joint ventures, 464 were industrial enterprises, 121 were commercial enterprises, and 61 were transportation (including cement and road construction) units.

By the end of October, enterprises that had implemented joint ventures accounted for 30% of the total number of capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises. It is expected that by the end of the year, joint state-private enterprises will account for more than 50% of the total number of capitalist enterprises.

The joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce in North Vietnam began at the end of last year, with pilot programs initially carried out in industries directly related to national construction and people's livelihoods. Some cities have already implemented joint state-private ownership in entire industries.

After the implementation of joint state-private ownership in capitalist industry and commerce, the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff has soared unprecedentedly, and labor discipline has been greatly strengthened due to the change in production relations. They have brought into play the spirit of being masters of the country, working hard in production and managing enterprises well. As a result, the production of the joint ventures has developed and income has increased. In the industrial sector, output has generally increased by 20% to 100%, with an average increase of 30%. After the Hanoi "Juli Machinery Factory" became a joint venture, the workers actively improved technology and are now able to manufacture rice milling machines weighing 15 to 30 tons. After the Hanoi "Rui Xi Leather Factory" became a joint venture, production costs were reduced by 11%. In the commercial sector, the relationship between the joint venture stores and state-owned trading companies has become closer, and the number of goods has greatly increased. Sales have generally increased, and income has generally increased, with many stores seeing an increase of three to four times.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 10th: Newspapers here reported today that, according to incomplete statistics, as of the end of October, 38.2% of farmers in North Vietnam had joined agricultural producers' cooperatives, approaching the target of having 40% of the total number of farmers join agricultural producers' cooperatives this year.

As of the end of October, 22,945 agricultural producers' cooperatives had been established, with 1,062,886 farm households. This figure is nearly double the number of farm households that joined the cooperatives at the end of July this year, and more than nine times the number at the end of last year. In addition, 2,199 agricultural cooperatives are under construction.

The Vinh Linh region has basically completed agricultural collectivization, with 92% of farm households having joined cooperatives. 56% of farm households in Phu Tho province have joined cooperatives; 51.7% of farm households in Quang Binh province have joined cooperatives; and 50.3%, 48%, and 46% of farm households in Hung Yen, Thai Binh, and Thanh Hoa provinces, respectively, have joined cooperatives. The rate of cooperative development in Nam Dinh province, which was originally slower, has increased from 9.3% in June to 28.2% now.

This great upsurge in the agricultural collectivization movement in North Vietnam was achieved on the basis of the recent debate on the "two roads" of socialism and capitalism in rural areas. Many farmers have realized that taking the road of collectivization is the only road to happiness.

    越南社会主义改造工作全面铺开
    资本主义工商业有百分之三十已实行公私合营
    三分之一以上的农户已参加了农业生产合作社
    新华社河内11日电　越南北方对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作，经过三批试点以后，目前正在全面铺开。
    到今年10月底为止，全北方已经有六百四十六家工商业户实行了公私合营，占资本主义工商业总户数的30％。在这些合营企业中，工业有四百六十四户，商业有一百二十一户，交通运输（包括水泥和筑路）有六十一个单位。
    到10月底实行合营的企业已占资本主义工商业总数的30％。预计年底公私合营的企业可达资本主义企业总数的50％以上。
    越南北方资本主义工商业的公私合营工作是从去年年底开始的，试点工作首先在对国家建设、人民生活有直接关系的行业中进行。有的城市目前有些行业已经实行了全行业的公私合营。
    资本主义工商业实行公私合营以后，由于生产关系的改变，广大职工的劳动热情空前高涨，劳动纪律大大加强，他们发挥了国家主人翁的精神，努力生产、管好企业。因而，合营后的企业生产有了发展，收入有了增加。在工业方面，产量一般增加20％到一倍，平均增加30％。河内“巨力机器厂”合营后，职工们积极改进技术，目前已能制造十五吨到三十吨重的碾米机。河内“瑞溪皮革厂”合营后生产成本降低11％。在商业方面，合营后的商店同国营贸易公司的关系更加密切，货物大大增多。销售量普遍提高，收入一般都有增加，不少商店收入增加了三倍到四倍。
    新华社河内10日电　此间报纸今天报道：据不完全统计，截至10月底为止，越南北方已经有38.2％的农户加入了农业生产合作社，接近了今年加入农业生产合作社的农户要达到总农户40％的指标。
    到10月底为止已经成立了二万二千九百四十五个农业生产合作社，拥有一百零六万二千八百八十六户农户。这个数字为今年7月底入社农户数字的将近一倍，为去年底的九倍多。此外，还有二千一百九十九个农业社正在筹建中。
    永灵区已基本上完成农业合作化，有92％的农户已经入社。富寿省有56％的农户入了社；广平省有51.7％的农户入了社；兴安、太平、清化等省入社农户分别占总农户的50.3％、48％、46％。合作化发展原先较慢的南定省6月间的入社农户只有9.3％，现在已增至28.2％。
    越南北方农业合作化运动这一巨大高涨是在农村中最近展开社会主义和资本主义“两条道路”的辩论的基础上达到的。许多农民认清了走合作化道路是唯一幸福的道路。
