Today, the Chinese people, together with the people of Asia and Africa, are responding with great enthusiasm to the call of the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council to hold activities commemorating "Congo Day."

Since the Congolese people launched a large-scale anti-colonialist struggle in Léopoldville in January this year, although the anti-imperialist surge on the banks of the Congo River has been undulating under the bloody suppression of the Belgian authorities, the heroic Congolese people have been constantly fighting for the cause of national liberation. Recently, a new struggle against Belgian colonial rule broke out in Stanleyville. Within a few days, this struggle spread to other cities, with workers holding strikes and demonstrations, resolutely demanding independence.

The vigorous anti-colonialist struggle launched by the Congolese people is a heavy blow to the colonial system in Africa. Because the Congo is not only the most fertile colony of imperialism in Africa, a warehouse of important strategic resources seized by American monopoly capital, but also, due to the Congo's geographical location, the Congolese people's struggle for national independence is bound to have a huge impact on the national independence movements of various countries in sub-Saharan Black Africa. Earlier this year, following the outbreak of the anti-colonialist struggle in the Congo, Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Uganda, Kenya, Tanganyika, Mozambique and other places also launched large-scale movements for national independence and freedom. More recently, the Belgian trusteeship of Ruanda-Urundi has also erupted into an anti-colonialist struggle sweeping the country. The African people, who have long been under colonial enslavement and exploitation, can no longer tolerate this state of disenfranchisement. They are breaking the shackles imposed on them by the colonialists with their own hands. Even the British Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" could not help but exclaim that if the Congo became independent, "the impact on the whole of British and French Africa would be incalculable."

Faced with the magnificent movement of the Congolese people for independence and freedom, the Belgian government has repeatedly wielded bloody butcher knives, wantonly slaughtering unarmed Congolese people. Countless bloody facts have proven the barbarity and inhumanity of Western colonialists. Janssens, Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian military police forces stationed in the Congo, shamelessly said after the Léopoldville bloodbath earlier this year: "We... killed a few people in order to teach a lesson to those who were not shot. If they don't quiet down again, we are ready to resume the sport!" Look! In the eyes of these executioners, killing people has become a "sport"! This is a powerful rebuttal to those who defend the colonialists. Recently, in the new bloodshed in Stanleyville, hundreds of residents were massacred in the first few days, and Patrice Lumumba, Chairman of the MNC, and many other Congolese nationalist leaders were arrested and imprisoned. However, no matter how the Belgian colonialists carry out barbaric suppression, the heroic Congolese people can never be subdued. Therefore, the Belgian colonial authorities have to simultaneously carry out political deception in every possible way. The Belgian Minister of Colonial Affairs, De Schrijver, recently announced that the Belgian government has decided to discuss the issue of so-called "phased independence" with "Congolese political leaders" in the Congo from November 20 to 30, and is planning the trick of so-called "elections." De Schrijver also used "economic aid" as bait in an attempt to paralyze the Congolese people's will to fight. However, the awakened Congolese people, through their own struggle experience, deeply know that the colonialists' empty promises of so-called "phased independence" are nothing more than an excuse to maintain their colonial rule. As Patrice Lumumba, the arrested leader of the MNC, pointed out: "Such a system can never provide the Congo with a truly democratic and representative government."

The deceptive plan put forward by the Belgian government has not only been spurned by the Congolese people, but also condemned by fair world opinion. However, it has won the applause of American imperialists across the Atlantic. The American "Time" magazine even said that it would be "tragic" for the Congolese people to reject the Belgian government's plan. The American "New York Herald Tribune" also wants the Congolese people to show "patience and rationality," and so on. Obviously, it can be seen from this that there is no common language between the Congolese people and the American imperialists. For the Congolese people, rejecting the colonialists' tricks and insisting on genuine independence is a righteous and great thing; but the propaganda machine of American imperialism considers it a "tragedy." If you have to say what "tragedy" is, it is a "tragedy" for the colonialists. Speaking of "patience and rationality," the Congolese people have "endured" under Belgian colonial rule for nearly a century, and they have endured enough; now it is necessary to remind all colonialists to be more "rational." They should understand that the era of colonialists running rampant has passed forever. These Wall Street propaganda machines are helping the Belgian colonialists, but once again proving that American imperialists and all old colonialists are birds of a feather.

The booming national independence movement in the Congo this year shows that the Congolese people are more closely united in the struggle against colonial rule, and are becoming increasingly mature politically and organizationally. The "Congolese National Federation of Workers," established in Léopoldville in April this year, is the first African workers' organization established by the Congolese working class to break through the control and influence of colonial forces. Under the unified leadership of the union, workers in various places actively participated in the struggle for independence, pushing the Congolese people's anti-colonialist struggle to a new stage. This is a major feature of the current Congolese national liberation movement. Many political parties in the Congo have played an important role in strengthening national unity and strengthening the struggle against colonialism. In June this year, ten Congolese African political parties jointly submitted a memorandum to the colonial government, demanding the establishment of an independent government run by Congolese people. This fact shows that the Congolese people's determination to unite and fight for national independence is indestructible.

The Congolese people's struggle for national independence is not only a part of the national liberation movement on the African continent, but also a part of the just cause of the people of the world for peace and democracy. Because colonialism is a threat to peace and a source of war. For the sake of peace, the colonial system must be destroyed. Every blow of the Congolese people and the people of other colonies in Africa to colonialism is in line with the greatest interests of the people of the world in opposing imperialism and striving for lasting peace. Therefore, the struggle of the Congolese people and the people of African countries against colonialism and for independence has won the deep sympathy and support of progressive mankind around the world. The Congolese people can fully expect that the Chinese people will always stand by your side on your road to independence and freedom. Although the Congolese people's struggle for independence and freedom will still encounter various difficulties and obstacles in the future, with the sympathy and support of the peace-loving and justice-loving people of the world, as long as the Congolese people continue to strengthen unity and persist in the struggle, victory will surely belong to the heroic Congolese people.

    胜利必属刚果人民
    今天，中国人民同亚非各国人民一道，以极大的热情响应亚非人民团结理事会书记处的号召，举行纪念“刚果日”的活动。
    自从今年1月刚果人民在利奥波德维尔掀起大规模的反殖民主义斗争以来，虽然刚果河畔的反对帝国主义的怒潮在比利时当局的血腥镇压下时有起伏，可是英勇的刚果人民为了民族解放的事业始终抗争不息。最近在斯坦利维尔又爆发了反抗比利时殖民统治的新的斗争。这一场斗争，在几天之内就蔓延到其他城市，工人们纷纷举行罢工和示威游行，坚决要求获得独立。
    刚果人民掀起的轰轰烈烈的反殖民主义斗争，是对非洲的殖民体系的一个沉重打击。因为，刚果不仅是帝国主义在非洲的最富饶的殖民地，是美帝国垄断资本攫取重要战略资源的仓库，而且由于刚果所处的地理位置，刚果人民争取民族独立的斗争对于撒哈拉以南的黑非洲的各国民族独立运动，必然发生巨大的影响。今年年初，继刚果的反殖民主义斗争爆发之后，南罗得西亚、北罗得西亚、尼亚萨兰、乌干达、怯尼亚、坦噶尼喀、莫三鼻给等地，也先后展开了声势浩大的争取民族独立和自由的运动。最近影响所及，比利时托管地卢安达一乌隆迪也爆发了席卷全国的反殖民主义斗争。长期以来在殖民奴役和压榨下的非洲人民，再不能忍受这种无权的地位了，他们正在用自己的双手粉碎殖民主义者强加在他们身上的镣铐。甚至连英国保守党的“每日电讯报”也不禁惊呼，刚果如果独立，“对整个英属和法属非洲的影响将是无法估计的”。
    面对着波澜壮阔的刚果人民争取独立和自由的运动，比利时政府一次又一次祭起血腥的屠刀，对手无寸铁的刚果人民滥施屠杀。无数血淋淋的事实证明了西方殖民主义者的野蛮和惨无人道。比利时驻刚果的军警部队总司令让逊斯在今年年初血洗利奥波德维尔之后曾经无耻地说：“我们……打死几个人是为了教训没有中弹的人。如果他们再不安静下去，我们随时准备恢复体育运动！”看！在这些刽子手眼里，杀人成了“体育运动”！这对于那些为殖民主义者辩护的人来说，是多么有力的驳斥。最近，在斯坦利维尔的新的流血事件中，在头几天里就有数百居民被屠杀，民族运动党主席卢蒙巴和刚果的其他许多民族主义领袖都被逮捕入狱。但是，不管比利时殖民者怎样进行野蛮的镇压，英勇的刚果人民是绝对压服不了的。因此，比利时殖民当局不得不同时千方百计地进行政治上的诱骗。比利时殖民事务大臣德舒里弗最近宣布，比利时政府决定在11月20日到30日在刚果同“刚果的政治领袖”讨论所谓“分阶段独立”的问题，并且策划所谓“选举”的把戏。德舒里弗还以“经济援助”为诱饵，企图麻痹刚果人民的斗争意志。但是，觉醒了的刚果人民通过切身的斗争经验，深知殖民主义者空口允诺的所谓“分阶段独立”等等，只不过是维护其殖民统治的遁辞。正如已被逮捕的刚果民族运动党领袖卢蒙巴所指出的：“这样一种制度，绝不能向刚果提供真正民主和有代表性的政府”。
    比利时政府提出的这个欺骗计划，不但遭到刚果人民的唾弃，而且受到全世界公正舆论的谴责。但是，它却博得大西洋彼岸的美国帝国主义者的喝采。美国“时代”杂志竟说，刚果人民拒绝比利时政府的方案将是“悲剧性”的。美国“纽约先驱论坛报”也要刚果人民表现“忍耐和理智”，等等。很显然，从这里可以看出，在刚果人民同美国帝国主义者之间，根本没有共同的语言。对刚果人民来说，拒绝殖民者的骗局，坚持要求真正的独立，是正义的大好事；而美国帝国主义的宣传机器却认为是一个“悲剧”。如果硬要说什么“悲剧”，那倒是一出殖民者的“悲剧”。说到什么“忍耐和理智”，刚果人民在比利时殖民统治下“忍耐”了将近一个世纪，他们已经忍耐得够了；现在倒是有必要提醒一切殖民主义者放“理智”些。他们应该懂得，殖民主义者横行霸道的时代已经永远过去了。这些华尔街宣传机器为比利时殖民者帮腔，不过再次证明美国帝国主义者和一切老牌殖民主义者都是一丘之貉。
    今年以来刚果蓬勃发展的民族独立运动表明，刚果人民在反对殖民统治的斗争中愈加紧密地团结一致，在政治上和组织上正日益成熟。今年4月在利奥波德维尔成立的“刚果全国工人联合会”，是刚果工人阶级突破殖民势力的控制和影响建立起来的第一个非洲工人组织。在工会的统一领导下，各地工人积极参加要求独立的斗争，把刚果人民的反殖民主义斗争推向了新的阶段。这是当前刚果民族解放运动中的一个重大特点。刚果的许多政党，在加强民族团结和加强反对殖民主义的斗争中，发挥了重要的作用。今年6月间，十个刚果非洲人政党联合向殖民政府提出备忘录，要求成立由刚果人管理的独立的政府。这个事实表明了刚果人民为了民族独立而团结起来进行斗争的坚决意志是不可摧毁的。
    刚果人民争取民族独立的斗争，不仅是非洲大陆民族解放运动的一部分，而且也是全世界人民争取和平、民主的正义事业的一部分。因为殖民主义是和平的威胁，是战争的根源。为了和平，就要摧毁殖民制度。刚果人民和非洲其他殖民地人民对于殖民主义的每一次打击，都符合于全世界人民反对帝国主义、争取持久和平的最大利益。因此，刚果人民和非洲各国人民的反对殖民主义、争取独立的斗争，赢得了全世界进步人类的深切同情和支持。刚果人民在自己争取独立和自由的道路上，完全可以指望，中国人民将始终不渝地站在你们这一边。刚果人民为独立自由的斗争尽管今后还会遇到种种困难和阻碍，但是，在全世界爱好和平与正义的人民的同情和支持下，只要刚果人民继续加强团结，坚持斗争，胜利一定是属于英勇的刚果人民的。
