Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Zhou Enlai, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council, hosted a grand banquet in the magnificent Great Hall of the People tonight to entertain all the representatives attending the National "Gathering of Heroes." Party and state leaders warmly celebrated the national heroes at the banquet tonight, rejoicing with the representatives in the great victory of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward.

Tonight, the grand banquet hall was brightly lit, and the platform was filled with blooming flowers. The huge, golden national emblem hung high in the center of the platform. More than six thousand representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers attending the banquet were all beaming with joy. With excitement, they drank and chatted with party and state leaders.

At precisely 6 o'clock, the banquet began. Premier Zhou Enlai stepped onto the platform and raised his glass to deliver a toast. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, he extended the warmest congratulations to all the heroes present. At this moment, thunderous applause erupted in the banquet hall, and all the representatives warmly thanked the party and state leaders for their concern.

Premier Zhou then said: "Let us all raise our glasses together, for the further implementation of the Party's General Line for socialist construction and a complete set of 'walking on two legs' policies, for the victory of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes, for the success of the increased production and conservation movement, for the early realization of the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan within this year, for catching up with Britain in the output of major industrial products in about ten years, for the early realization of the National Program for Agricultural Development (1956-1967), for strengthening national defense, safeguarding world peace, and for building our motherland into a great Socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, Cheers!"

Premier Zhou Enlai concluded his speech with an enthusiastic proposal: to congratulate all the national heroes on their good health, and to congratulate the great leader of all ethnic groups in the country, Chairman Mao Zedong, on his good health, Cheers!

Premier Zhou Enlai's speech aroused bursts of applause in the banquet hall. The representatives all stood up from their seats and applauded for a long time, expressing their determination to respond to the Party's great call.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Li Fuchun, Vice Premier of the State Council, sat at a banquet table with famous model figures such as Meng Tai, Yi Shijuan, Yuan Wenzhou, Zha Xiyangji, Wang Feng'en, Su Guangming, Liu Jiuxue, Zhang Baifa, Li Chuanjiang, Huang Kun, Gao Fengqin, and Hu Zhanfang. They toasted the heroes and talked cordially with them.

After Premier Zhou's speech, Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and twelve other famous labor models stepped onto the stage to deliver a speech on behalf of all advanced producers at the "Gathering of Heroes," expressing their gratitude to the Party for its concern and cultivation. Liu Ningyi said: "All the representatives of our conference wholeheartedly and enthusiastically respond to the great combat call put forward by the Party Central Committee, and thank the Party for its concern and cultivation. We guarantee to fulfill and overfulfill this year's national plan ahead of schedule, and guarantee to achieve continued leap forward next year. We must make all preparations to achieve a good start, a monthly red, a full house red, and a yearly red in production and construction next year. Our national staff guarantees: Wherever the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao point us, we will fight there."

The determination expressed by Liu Ningyi on behalf of all the heroic figures was immediately met with an extremely warm response. Amid bursts of thunderous applause and music, Zhong Min, head of the Shanghai delegation, Jin Zhifu, head of the Liaoning delegation, Peng Guangwei, head of the Sichuan delegation, Zhang Ying, head of the Tibet delegation, Zhang Zhian, head of the General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Railway Corps delegation, Zhao Mengtao, an advanced textile worker from Shaanxi Province, Chen Kedong, head of the Hubei delegation, and Zhang Xijun, deputy head of the Central Cultural, Educational, Health, and Scientific and Technological Departments delegation, respectively represented the entire delegations from twenty-eight provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and central departments in toasting the Party and state leaders, expressing that they would resolutely respond to the Party's combat call and advance further and further along the road of victory pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao.

The grand banquet was filled with endless joy from beginning to end. During the banquet, many representatives constantly confided their inner passion to their companions, expressing their boundless love for the Party and state leaders; many representatives freely talked about the gains of attending this "Gathering of Heroes," expressing that they would contribute even greater strength to the high tide of production and construction after returning. Dawa, a blacksmith at the Lhasa Automobile Repair Factory who was a slave not long ago, said: "In the past, the serf owners did not treat me as a human being at all. Today, I can participate in such a grand banquet and sit on an equal footing with the leading comrades of the central government. It really feels like a dream."

Wang Dexing, a 73-year-old miner at Jingxi Coal Mine, was so excited that tears flowed down his face. He said: "I have worked for fifty years, and I never thought I would have such a great honor today." Gong Baoren, a 72-year-old chief engineer of the Transportation Department of Baotou Iron and Steel Company, improvised a poem, expressing his determination to contribute his life to the cause of socialist construction. Wei Gaohou, a milling machine operator and well-known innovation expert from Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory, proposed his own leap forward plan to other representatives on the spot.

At the end of the banquet, Premier Zhou Enlai raised his glass again, proposing that all the representatives have a toast together, wishing our country to achieve "full house red" in production and construction this year, and continue to achieve the victory of "monthly red" next year. At this time, warm applause rang out again in the hall. The representatives clinked glasses one after another, congratulating each other on "full house red"! "Monthly red"!

Before the banquet began, Premier Zhou Enlai received some representatives of famous advanced producers attending the "Gathering of Heroes."
