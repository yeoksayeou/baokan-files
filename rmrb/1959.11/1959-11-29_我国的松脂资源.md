    China's Pine Resin Resources
    Pine resin is a gluey liquid secreted from the trunks of pine trees. Pine resin, after distillation, refining, and removal of impurities, can be made into rosin and turpentine.
    Rosin and turpentine are both important industrial raw materials. Rosin is used directly and indirectly in hundreds of industries such as soap, paper making, paint, rubber, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and matches. Turpentine is also widely used in metallurgy, the chemical industry, and the manufacture of pesticides, paints, medicines, and fragrances.
    China's pine resin resources are very rich. Pine trees are found all over the country, especially in the southern provinces, where there are large quantities of Masson pines and Yunnan pines suitable for resin tapping.
    Pine roots left over from logging can also be used to extract rosin and turpentine. China's potential for increased production in this area is also very large. According to a survey of standard plots selected by the Shuanghezi Forestry Bureau in Heilongjiang Province, there are approximately 600 tree roots per hectare of pine forest, with each tree root averaging 60 kilograms. In 1958, the planned logging volume here was 3,125 hectares. If pine resin is extracted by boiling the pine roots, at least 7,000 tons can be obtained.
    In many pine forest areas, naturally secreted pine resin (rosin scars) are discarded on the ground. Mobilizing the masses to collect these pine resins can also yield a considerable amount of rosin.
    In recent years, China's rosin production has developed rapidly. The output in 1957 reached 120,000 tons, more than six times higher than the highest annual output before the war (1936). However, due to the rapid development of China's industrial production, the production of rosin still cannot meet the needs of all sectors.

### 我国的松脂资源

    我国的松脂资源
    松脂是松树树干里分泌出来的胶状液体。松脂经过蒸馏、提炼、除去杂质，就可以得到松香和松节油。
    松香和松节油都是重要的工业原料。松香直接、间接地用于肥皂、造纸、油漆、橡胶、制药、化工、火柴等等几百种工业。松节油的用途也很广泛，冶金、化学等工业以及制造农药、油漆、医药、香料等也都需要它。
    我国松脂资源十分丰富，松树遍于全国，特别在南方各省有大量可供采脂的马尾松、云南松等。
    采伐剩下的松树根也可以提出松香和松节油。我国在这一方面的增产潜力也是很大的。据黑龙江省双河子森工局选择的标准地的调查，一公顷松林约有六百个树根，每个树根平均为六十公斤。1958年这里的计划采伐量是三千一百二十五公顷，如果用水煮明子的方法提取松脂，至少可以达到七千多吨。
    不少松林地区，有松树自然分泌的松脂（松香疤）遗弃地上。发动群众拾取这些松脂，也可以得不少松香。
    几年来我国松香生产发展很快，1957年的产量就达到十二万吨，比战前（1936年）的最高年产量高六倍多。但是由于我国工业生产的迅速发展，松香的生产还不能满足各方面的需要。
