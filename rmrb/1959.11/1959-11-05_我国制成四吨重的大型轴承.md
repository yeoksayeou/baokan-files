Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, November 4th: The Luoyang Bearing Factory recently successfully trial-produced China's first 10777-750 type four-row tapered roller extra-large bearing. This set of bearings is composed of two hundred and twenty-four parts. Its outer diameter is 1.224 meters (outer diameters over one meter are generally called extra-large bearings), its height is 0.84 meters, and its net weight is 3.994 tons. This set of bearings is an important accessory for thin plate rolling mills, which are extremely efficient in production. Currently, only industrialized countries in the world can manufacture this type of bearing. The successful trial production of this bearing by the Luoyang Bearing Factory marks a major step forward in China's bearing industry in the manufacture of precision, sophisticated, heavy, and large products.
