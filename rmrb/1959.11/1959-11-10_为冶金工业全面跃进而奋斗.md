Strive for a Comprehensive Leap Forward in the Metallurgical Industry
By Our Commentator

    Since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party called for "opposing rightism, boosting morale, and practicing increased production and economy," the production of the metallurgical industry has shown a rapidly rising trend. On all fronts of the metallurgical industry, a new high tide of vigorous mass movements has been set off. Taking the daily steel production level as an example, it has risen by more than 60% in the short period of July, August, and September. This is a victory for the Party's great call to "oppose rightism and boost morale." Our current task is to thoroughly oppose rightism, resolutely boost morale, and strive to complete this year's production and construction tasks of the metallurgical industry ahead of schedule and in excess of quotas, and to prepare for continued leaps forward next year. In particular, we must continue to organize the realization of a comprehensive leap forward in the metallurgical industry. From the iron and steel industry to the non-ferrous metal industry, from the production of steel, iron, and steel materials to copper, aluminum, and other non-ferrous metals, from mining, beneficiation, smelting to processing, including a series of production links such as coking, refractory materials, ferroalloys, transportation, power, and machine repair, from output, construction period, quality, cost, labor productivity, equipment utilization rate, metal recovery rate, to the reduction rate of coke, coal, and steel consumption, all these indicators, without exception, must continue to leap forward. We must do everything possible to improve quality, improve technology, expand the variety of steel and non-ferrous metals, and increase the proportion of high-quality steel and alloy steel. In short, we must ensure that the production and capital construction of the iron and steel industry and the non-ferrous metal industry achieve high output, high speed, high quality, low consumption, and low cost in the future, and strive for a comprehensive leap forward that is more, faster, better, and more economical.
    How to organize the realization of this arduous task? We believe that under the leadership of the Party, we must adhere to putting politics in command, oppose rightism, boost morale, and conscientiously do the following aspects of work well.
    First, better plan, prepare, and organize production and construction, change the usual practice of being "loose in the beginning and tight at the end," and make production and construction continue to rise continuously. On the basis of achieving the completion of this year's plan ahead of schedule and exceeding quotas, we will strive for a flying start in the first quarter of next year, and maintain a red banner every month and a red banner in every aspect.
    Second, adhere to the policy of "walking on two legs." In the past two years, the new force of "small indigenous groups" has shown increasing power. Recently, good news has been pouring in. Not only have there emerged "small indigenous group" red banner units with high output, high quality, and low cost, such as the Ma'anshan Red Flag No. 2 small blast furnace, the Qingdao Bicycle Factory small converter, the Zhengzhou small aluminum plant, and the Macheng and Youxian small-scale integrated iron and steel enterprises, but also many areas with large-scale bumper harvests have emerged. Now we must continue to unswervingly implement the policy of "walking on two legs," while developing large foreign groups, accelerate the construction of medium-sized iron and steel enterprises in various localities, vigorously consolidate and improve the "small indigenous groups" of the iron and steel industry, and continue to develop a number of "small indigenous groups" and "small earthen groups" in the non-ferrous metal industry.
    Third, continue to vigorously carry out mass movements under the leadership of the Party, and improve the level of organizing competitions. This year, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company carried out the form of "one-dragon competition," which was later promoted by Anshan Iron and Steel and developed into "one-dragon collaboration competition." This kind of competition is suitable for the characteristics of complex continuous and joint production from raw materials and smelting to processing in metallurgical enterprises, and runs through the spirit of communist collaboration. The workers of the No. 3 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel later created a new form of "technical performance competition," which was promoted by the entire Anshan Iron and Steel Company and combined with the "one-dragon collaboration competition" to develop into a "joint technical performance competition," which enabled us to find a very good form of carrying out socialist labor competition in the metallurgical industry. This new form has attracted the broadest masses of people to jointly strive for the continuous and comprehensive improvement of the production of joint enterprises and the continuous innovation of technology. In the future, we must widely use and develop this kind of competition and raise the level of organizing competitions in metallurgical enterprises to a new height.
    Fourth, continuously promote and create advanced experiences. Since the Great Leap Forward, the metallurgical industry has seen the emergence of a large number of advanced collectives and advanced producers, who, together with the broad masses of people, under the leadership of the Party, have created thousands of advanced experiences. These advanced experiences are constantly opening up new roads for further developing the productive forces. As long as we conscientiously promote these advanced experiences and raise the general level to the advanced level, we can increase the production of steel by millions of tons and non-ferrous metals by tens of thousands of tons every year without increasing the main equipment, and we can save a lot of funds, raw materials, fuel, and raw materials. We must adhere to the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, dare to innovate, dare to break through all difficulties, dare to fight against all shackles that hinder the development of new things, and foster these new things with full enthusiasm, develop and promote them. At the same time, we must adhere to the idea of continuous revolution, use the innovation of thinking to promote the innovation of production technology, so as to continuously create new levels and more advanced experiences, and continuously promote the leap forward of production technology in the metallurgical industry.
    Fifth, overcome weak links and take effective measures in all aspects of the metallurgical industry's "before, after, left, and right" to create material and technical conditions for a comprehensive leap forward. Judging from the current situation of the metallurgical industry, it is particularly necessary to strengthen the relatively weak links such as mines, steel rolling, transportation, machine repair, refractory materials, and coking. It is imperative that the before, after, left, and right of the iron and steel and non-ferrous metal industries can keep up with the needs of development.
    We hope that the heroes on the metallurgical industry front, guided by the red banner of the general line, will unite millions of workers, boost greater morale, and push the production and construction of the metallurgical industry to a new upsurge.

    为冶金工业全面跃进而奋斗
    本报评论员
    自从党的八届八中全会号召“反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约”以来，冶金工业的生产出现了一个扶摇直上的局面，在冶金工业的各个战线上，都掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众运动的新高潮。以钢的日产水平为例，在短短的7、8、9三个月当中，竟上升百分之六十几，这是党的“反右倾、鼓干劲”的伟大号召的胜利。当前我们的任务是：彻底反透右倾，坚决鼓足干劲，力争提前、超额完成今年冶金工业的生产、建设任务，并为明年的继续跃进做好准备工作，特别是必须继续组织实现冶金工业的全面跃进。从钢铁工业到有色金属工业，从钢、铁、钢材到铜、铝以及其他有色金属的生产，从采矿、选矿、冶炼一直到加工，包括炼焦、耐火材料、铁合金、运输、动力、机修等一系列的生产环节，从产量、工期、质量、成本、劳动生产率、设备利用率、金属回收率，一直到焦、煤和钢铁消耗的降低率等一系列的指标，无例外地都要继续跃进。我们要千方百计地提高质量、改进技术，扩大钢材和有色金属的品种，增加优质钢和合金钢的比重。总之，要使钢铁工业和有色金属工业的生产和基本建设，都在今后达到高产、高速、优质、低耗、低成本，力争多、快、好、省地全面跃进。
    如何来组织这个艰巨任务的实现呢？我们认为，必须在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，反右倾，鼓干劲，认真做好下列几方面的工作。
    第一，更好地计划、准备和组织生产和建设，改变“前松后紧”的惯例，使生产和建设持续不断地上涨。在实现提前、超额完成今年计划的基础上，力争明年第一季度开门红，并且保持月月红，满堂红。
    第二，坚持“两条腿走路”的方针。两年来“小洋群”这一支新生力量，已经显出愈来愈大的威力。最近以来，更是捷报频传。不但出现了像马鞍山红旗二号小高炉、青岛自行车厂小转炉、郑州小铝厂、麻城和攸县小型联合钢铁企业这样的高产、优质、低成本的“小洋群”红旗单位，而且出现了不少大面积丰产的地区。现在我们必须继续坚定不移地贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针，在发展大洋群的同时，加速建设各地方的中型钢铁企业，大力巩固和提高钢铁工业的“小洋群”，并继续发展一批有色金属工业的“小洋群”、“小土群”。
    第三，在党的领导下继续大搞群众运动，把组织竞赛的水平提高一步。今年，重庆钢铁公司开展了“一条龙竞赛”的形式，后来为鞍钢推广并发展为“一条龙协作竞赛”。这种竞赛适合于冶金企业从原料、冶炼到加工一系列复杂的连续、联合生产的特点，贯穿了共产主义协作的精神。鞍钢第三炼钢厂的职工，后来又创造了“技术表演竞赛”的新形式，鞍钢全公司把它推广，并与“一条龙协作竞赛”结合起来，发展成为“联合技术大表演竞赛”，这就使我们找到了冶金工业开展社会主义劳动竞赛的一种很好的形式。这种新形式吸引了最广泛的群众，共同为不断地、全面地提高联合企业的生产和不断革新技术而奋斗。今后我们要广泛地运用和发展这种竞赛，将冶金企业组织竞赛的水平提到一个新的高度。
    第四，不断推广和创造先进经验。大跃进以来，冶金工业涌现了大批先进集体和先进生产者，他们与广大群众在一起，在党的领导下，创造了成千上万的先进经验。这些先进经验为进一步发展生产力不断开辟着新的道路。只要我们认真推广这些先进经验，将一般的水平提高到先进的水平，我们就可以在不增加主要设备的条件下每年增产数以百万吨计的钢铁和以万吨计的有色金属，就可以节约大量的资金、原料、燃料和原材料。我们必须坚持敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，敢于革新，敢于冲破一切难关，敢于和一切阻碍新事物发展的束缚进行斗争，并以满腔热情去扶植这些新事物，加以发展和推广。同时，要坚持不断革命的思想，以思想的革新来促进生产技术的革新，以便不断创造新的水平和更多的先进经验，不断地使冶金工业的生产技术向前跃进。
    第五，克服薄弱环节，对冶金工业的“前后左右”各个方面采取有力措施，为全面跃进创造物质技术条件。从目前冶金工业的情况来看，特别要加强矿山、轧钢、运输、机修、耐火材料、炼焦等比较薄弱的环节。务使钢铁和有色金属工业的前后左右，能够跟上发展的需要。
    我们希望冶金工业战线上的英雄们，在总路线的红旗引导下，团结数百万职工，鼓起更大的干劲，把冶金工业的生产建设推向一个新的高涨。
