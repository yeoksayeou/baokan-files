Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The National Stratigraphy Conference officially opened in Beijing on the 14th after more than two years of preparation.

Stratigraphy is a major part of geological science; it is the basis for compiling geological maps and prospecting, especially for sedimentary minerals (such as coal, oil, natural gas, iron, manganese, copper, aluminum, tin, titanium, etc.), and also for studying the history of crustal development. Therefore, the holding of this conference is an important matter both in scientific work and in national economic construction.

The preparatory work over the past two years has gone through three stages: collecting papers, holding field conferences, and preparing various reports for the conference. Currently, more than one hundred papers have been received; field conferences on sedimentary minerals such as oil fields, iron mines, and coal mines have been held successively in the Songliao Plain, Xinyu in Jiangxi, Songshan in Henan, the Hexi Corridor in Gansu, and Shouchang in western Zhejiang; five regional stratigraphy field conferences have been held in Lanzhou, western Zhejiang, southern Jiangxi, southern Guizhou, and Shanxi. This series of field conferences has basically solved some key problems in stratigraphic division and correlation, explored some theoretical problems in stratigraphy, and basically achieved the requirement of establishing stratigraphic standard sections in the Northwest, North China, Southeast, Nanling, and Southwest regions; rich stratigraphic data have been collected, stratigraphic correlation charts for ten geological periods and four regional stratigraphic charts have been compiled, and the achievements of stratigraphy in China over the past forty years, especially the ten years since the founding of the country, have been systematically summarized according to geological period, region, and sedimentary mineral type, and twenty-five scientific summary reports have been written; draft stratigraphic norms and their explanatory notes have been drafted, and a draft of the stratigraphic regionalization of China has been proposed. The basic documents submitted for discussion at this conference total about four million words.

The conference is co-sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Petroleum Industries, the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the Geological Society of China. More than 500 geological and paleontological researchers, teaching staff, and geological engineering technicians from 177 units of the above-mentioned departments and 21 universities are participating in the conference. The Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources Protection have specially formed a delegation headed by Academician Nalivkin, with well-known stratigraphers and paleontologists, and have been invited to attend the conference. Soviet stratigraphy and paleontology experts working in China have also been invited to attend the conference. Soviet scientists will also make academic reports at the conference.

The main tasks of this conference are: to summarize the achievements of stratigraphic work in the past ten years since the founding of the country based on the principle of combining theory and practice; to exchange experiences and learn from advanced Soviet experiences; to discuss and solve some important problems in stratigraphic division and correlation, etc.

Li Siguang, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Minister of Geology, said in his opening speech: Before liberation, stratigraphic work in our country was very weak. In the ten years since the founding of the new China, under the wise leadership of the Party, geological and paleontological workers have improved their political awareness, improved their work direction and methods, learned from advanced Soviet experience, and carried out a large number of geological surveys and prospecting work, clarifying many major issues in Chinese stratigraphy, and achieving significant achievements in stratigraphic division and correlation. Now our stratigraphic work has progressed from the stage of combining points, lines, and surfaces; in areas that were blank or weakly researched before liberation, stratigraphic systems have now been initially divided, and in areas where there was some working foundation in the past, in-depth work has also been carried out, becoming regions where we have relatively rich stratigraphic data; Chinese stratigraphy has been gradually established, and related disciplines such as ancient invertebrates, ancient vertebrates, and ancient plants have been further developed; links that were very weak before liberation have been strengthened and categories that were blank before liberation have been established, such as micro-paleo animals, spores, and pollen, etc. Li Siguang also pointed out some problems existing in stratigraphic work, such as regional imbalance and the emphasis on general description in the study of stratigraphy. He said that in order to rapidly develop stratigraphic science, it is necessary to further implement the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom" policy for scientific work; and resolutely oppose the bourgeois ideology and bourgeois academic viewpoints that still exist in stratigraphy and related research work.

Wu Heng, Deputy Director of the State Science and Technology Commission, spoke at the meeting. He put forward several suggestions for the conference to refer to on how to leap forward better, bigger, and more comprehensively in stratigraphic work in the future. He said that stratigraphic work, like other scientific work, must adhere to putting politics in command and implement the Party's mass line; it must proceed from the general task of socialist construction and serve it. The requirements put forward in geological work should be the primary task of stratigraphic work; planned development of the national economy is an important economic law of socialism, which determines that our scientific and technological undertakings must and can also develop in a planned way. It is impossible to carry out stratigraphic work smoothly in such a vast territory as ours without overall planning and division of labor and cooperation among departments and regions; the development of stratigraphy is closely combined with the development of paleontology, and more work should be continued in paleontology in the future; past stratigraphic work has not done enough to theoretically explain the laws of stratigraphic development in depth, and attention should be paid to applying many related sciences to stratigraphic work in the future; in order to gradually systematically compare the stratigraphy of various regions across the country and establish the stratigraphic system and unified stratigraphic chart of each region and even the whole country, stratigraphic work must be carried out more widely and comprehensively in the future on the premise of combining with production needs; carrying out academic debates and criticisms, and when solving major and complex stratigraphic problems, it is necessary to explore from the overall and various aspects of the problem, and fully develop independent thinking and organize everyone to conduct joint research and launch academic debates. Only in this way can our understanding of stratigraphy be closer to objective reality.

Academician Gorsky of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Belyevsky, representative of the Soviet Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources Protection, delivered congratulatory speeches successively. Gorsky said: "We are convinced that this conference will definitely make many new, meaningful, and valuable contributions in stratigraphy, which will have great theoretical and practical significance not only for China but also for the entire world science."

Belyevsky said: "The achievements of socialist construction require a material foundation, and the foundation of the material foundation is mineral raw materials. Let us further expand these resources!" He also said: "The advanced geological science of socialist countries has always served practice, and geological personnel can work more, faster, better, and more economically on the basis of practice."

Yin Zanhun, Director of the Department of Earth Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, reported on "The Achievements of Stratigraphic Work and the Development of Stratigraphy in the Past Ten Years Since the Founding of the Country."

On the 15th and 16th, the conference held group discussions and began academic reports.

    推动地层工作更好地为社会主义建设服务
    全国地层会议在京开幕
    苏联科学院、苏联地质和矿藏保护部代表团应邀出席会议
    新华社16日讯　全国地层会议经过两年多的筹备，14日在北京正式开幕。
    地层学是地质科学中的一个主要部分；是编制地质图和找矿，特别是寻找沉积矿产（如煤、石油、天然气、铁、锰、铜、铝、锡、钛等等）的基础，也是研究地壳发展史的基础。所以这次会议的举行，不论在科学工作中和国家经济建设中，都是一件重要的事情。
    两年来的准备工作，经过了三个阶段：征集论文，举行现场会议，为会议准备各项报告。现在，收到的论文已有一百多篇；在松辽平原、江西新喻、河南嵩山、甘肃河西走廊和浙西寿昌先后举行了油田、铁矿和煤矿等沉积矿产地层的现场会议，在兰州、浙西、南岭、黔南和山西举行过五个区域地层现场会议。这一系列的现场会议已经基本上解决了地层划分和对比中的某些关键问题，探讨了地层学中的一些理论问题，基本上实现了在西北、华北、东南、南岭和西南地区树立地层标准剖面的要求；搜集了丰富的地层资料，分别编制了十个地质时代的地层对比表和四个区域地层表，对我国四十多年来、特别是建国十年来地层学的成就，按地质时代、地区和沉积矿种进行了系统的概括，编写出了二十五个科学总结报告；草拟了地层规范及其说明书，提出了中国地层区划草案。这次提交会议讨论的基本文件共有四百万字左右。
    会议是中国科学院、地质部、石油工业部、煤炭工业部、冶金工业部和中国地质学会联合召开的。参加会议的有上述各部门和二十一所高等学校共一百七十七个单位的地质古生物研究工作者、教学工作者和地质工程技术人员等五百多人。苏联科学院、苏联地质和矿藏保护部特地组成了以纳利夫金院士为首的、有知名地层古生物学家参加的代表团，应邀前来出席会议。在中国帮助工作的苏联地层古生物专家也应邀出席了会议。苏联科学家们并将在会上作学术报告。
    这次会议的主要任务是：根据理论与实践相结合的原则，总结建国十年来地层工作的成就；交流经验，学习苏联先进经验；讨论和解决地层划分和对比方面的一些重要问题等。
    中国科学院副院长、地质部部长李四光在会议开幕词中说：在解放以前，我国地层工作十分薄弱。新中国建立十年来，在党的英明领导下，地质古生物工作者在政治觉悟提高、工作方向和方法改进、学习苏联先进经验、开展了大量地质测量和普查工作的基础上，明确了许多中国地层学上的重大问题，对地层的划分和对比获得了显著的成就，现在我们的地层工作已经由点、线走向和面相结合的阶段；在解放前是空白的和研究工作薄弱的地区，现在都已初步划分了地层系统，过去已有一些工作基础的地区，也进行了深入的工作，成为我们掌握地层资料较为丰富的区域；逐渐建立了中国的地层学，并且使得有关学科如古无脊椎动物、古脊椎动物和古植物等方面得到了进一步的发展；加强了解放前十分薄弱的环节和建立了解放前空白的门类，如微体古动物、孢子花粉等等。李四光同时指出了地层工作中存在的一些问题，如区域上的不平衡、对地层的研究偏重于一般描述等。他说，为了迅速发展地层科学，必须进一步贯彻党对科学工作的“百家争鸣”方针；坚决反对目前在地层和有关研究工作中还存在着的资产阶级思想和资产阶级学术观点。
    国家科学技术委员会副主任武衡在会上讲话。他对于地层工作今后如何更好、更大、更全面地跃进，提出了几点意见供会议参考。他说，地层工作和其他科学工作一样，必须坚持政治挂帅和贯彻党的群众路线；要从社会主义建设的总任务出发并为它服务。地质工作中提出的要求就应当是地层工作的首要任务；有计划地发展国民经济是社会主义的一个重要经济规律，这决定了我国科学技术事业也必须而且能够有计划地发展，在我们这样广大的国土上从事地层工作，如果没有全面规划，没有各部门各地区的分工协作，是不可能顺利开展工作的；地层学的发展是与古生物学的发展紧密结合的，今后要继续在古生物学方面进行更多的工作；过去的地层工作从理论上深入阐明地层发育规律做得不够，今后要注意把许多有关的科学运用到地层工作中来；为了逐步系统地对比全国各地区的地层，建立各地区以至全国的地层系统和统一地层表，今后地层工作必须在结合生产需要的前提下，更广泛、更全面地开展工作；开展学术上的争论和批评，在解决重大、复杂的地层问题时，必须从问题的全面和各个侧面来探讨，要充分发挥独立思考和组织大家共同研究，展开学术论争，只有这样，才有可能使我们对地层的认识更接近客观实际。
    苏联科学院代表高尔斯基通讯院士和苏联地质和矿藏保护部代表别里耶夫斯基相继致祝辞。高尔斯基说：“我们深信，这次大会一定能在地层学方面作出许多新的、有意义的和珍贵的贡献，这不仅对于中国有贡献，对于整个世界科学都将有巨大的理论和实际意义。”
    别里耶夫斯基说：“社会主义建设的成就要有物质基础，而物质基础的基础是矿物原料，让我们进一步扩大这些资源吧！”他还说：“社会主义国家的先进地质科学从来就是为实践服务的，地质人员在实践的基础上才能多快好省地工作。”
    中国科学院地学部主任尹赞勋在会上报告了“建国十年来地层工作的成就和地层学的发展”。
    十五、十六两天，会议进行小组讨论并开始学术报告。
