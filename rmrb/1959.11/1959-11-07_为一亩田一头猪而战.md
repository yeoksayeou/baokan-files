Fighting for One Pig Per Mu of Land
Jiangxi Daily Reporter Liu Furong

Having heard that the Zhujia Brigade of the Fenggang People's Commune in Nankang County had initiated a campaign for "one pig per mu of land" and was challenging the entire province, I rushed to the Zhujia Brigade. Here, I saw that the brigade's cadres and members had already taken action in many ways. The following are a few excerpts from their actions.

Half a year ago, I visited Zhang Nianfeng, the national model for pig breeding and the person in charge of pig breeding work in this team. She was the first person I encountered that day. She was leading three people in talking about a small pig at the pig farm. I walked in, exchanged greetings, and she continued to say to the three people: "The pig has asthma. I have three effective treatments: one is to inject sulfathiazole sodium, the kind of medicine I showed you last night; the second is to use folk remedies and herbs, such as boiling the heart of a banana tree... into water and feeding it; the third is acupuncture, performed on the pig's back and belly. To save expenses, we will first use herbal medicine, and if it doesn't work, then we will inject or use other treatments." Then, a feeder brought a bowl of very thick herbal soup. Nianfeng said it was banana water and spoon-fed the medicine to the pig. After completing this practical lecture, Nianfeng invited me to sit in their "Feeder's Home." As we walked out, Nianfeng told me: "Those three people are here to learn epidemic prevention. Two are from the youth pig farm, and one is from our farm." Speaking of this, Nianfeng pondered for a while, then continued to open her mouth: "If we don't train more epidemic prevention personnel, it will be a big problem when there are more pigs in the future!"

"You are a very good teacher!"

"Don't praise me, I'm not catching an ox to plow the field!" she replied modestly.

Before long, we arrived at the "Feeder's Home." Upon entering, this home looked like a factory. Feeders were processing feed in a series of steps, some crushing it, some loading it into pots to cook, extremely busy. Shortly after Nianfeng entered, she was called to the brigade, so I started chatting with the feeders who were at home:

"To achieve one pig per mu of land by March next year,..."

Before I could finish, they chimed in with a barrage of responses: "If we didn't have the determination, how would we dare to challenge the whole province!" A feeder sitting in front of me crushing feed boldly answered my question. "Hehe! After the competition letter was sent out, we have already increased dozens of pigs in just a few days!" Another female feeder enthusiastically joined in.

"If there were no changes, our Model Zhang's mat would almost be worn out (meaning she was so worried she couldn't sleep)." The feeder loading the material told me this.

"How do you know she's thinking about the one pig per mu of land thing?" I pressed her.

"How could she not be? Let me tell you: that day, oh, it was the afternoon of September 13th, I heard our brigade leader say to her that we would achieve one pig per mu of land by March next year, and he asked her to ask the feeders if they had confidence? ...That night, I woke up several times and heard her tossing and turning, unable to sleep. The next day, she called us to a meeting. I predicted that she would definitely bring out her ideas from the previous night, and it was exactly as I expected. She said: 'To achieve one pig per mu of land, each sow must give birth to a litter of piglets before March next year, and each litter must guarantee nine piglets to meet the quota. I thought about it last night, and based on our existing experience, as long as everyone further boosts their morale and earnestly does a good job in matching fine, coarse, green, and diverse feeds, enhances the health of the sows, and makes the sows go into heat early, all the sows can give birth to a litter of piglets in February; moreover, if the sows are healthy, we can fully implement double mating, and the number of piglets per litter can greatly exceed the brigade's requirements.' See, I didn't guess wrong, did I!"

Behind the youth pig farm, the construction team was busy building new houses. From Lin Mingjiang, the brigade leader in charge of pig raising, I learned that these were houses being built for the new feeders, a total of three large rooms.

"Today is Fenggang Market, why isn't everyone going to the market?"

"Why aren't you going to the market?" a mischievous young man retorted.

"I have an important matter to find your team leader about."

"Our one pig per mu of land is also very important!" Our back-and-forth made everyone laugh. Lin Mingjiang told me that according to the one pig per mu of land plan, more than twenty additional feeders needed to be added, and these people would be gradually transferred out, urgently needing places to live. After the construction team comrades accepted the task of building the houses, they proposed the guarantee of "starting work early, finishing work late, not going to the market if there is nothing to do, and completing the task ahead of schedule." Therefore, on the first market day after construction began, no one took a break. Although I arrived at this construction site at noon, when it was time to rest, everyone was still working so happily. How high their enthusiasm was!

### 为一亩田一头猪而战

    为一亩田一头猪而战
    江西日报记者　刘甫荣
    听说南康县凤岗人民公社朱家大队搞起一亩田一头猪运动，并且向全省挑战，我便赶到朱家大队。在这里，我看到这个大队的干部和社员已经从多方面行动起来了。下面记录的是他们行动中的几个片断。
    半年前，我访问过的全国养猪模范、这个队的生猪繁殖工作的负责人张年凤，是我这天第一个碰到的人。她领着三个人正在养猪场对着一个小猪在说着什么。我走进去，互相招呼后，她继续对那三个人说：猪患了气喘病，我治过的有效办法有三种，一是注射磺胺噻唑钠，就是昨天晚上给你们看的那种药；二是用民间药方和草药，如用芭蕉兜……熬成水喂；三是针灸疗法，在猪的背上、肚上进行针灸。为了节省开支，这三种治法，先用草药，没效再注射或再采用别的疗法。随着，一个饲养员端来一碗很浓的草药汤，年凤说这是芭蕉水，便把药一匙一匙地灌给小猪吃。年凤做完这场实地讲授，邀我到她们“饲养员之家”坐坐。我们一边往外走，年凤一边告诉我：那三个人都是来学防疫的，有两个是青年养猪场的，一个是我们这个场的。说到这里，年凤沉思了一会，然后继续打开话匣：“不多搞几个防疫员，将来猪多了是个大事呵！”
    “你这个先生当得很好啦！”
    “别夸奖，没牛捉到马耕田！”她谦虚地回答。
    不一会就到了“饲养员之家”。一进门，但见这个家就像工厂一样。饲养员按一道道工序在处理饲料，有的在碎料，有的在装往锅里煮，异常繁忙。年凤进门一会，就被人叫到大队去了，我便和在家的饲养员攀谈开了：
    “明年3月份实现一亩田一头猪，……”
    没等我说完，她们七嘴八舌地就来了：“没决心，还敢向全省挑战！”坐在我前面碎料的一位饲养员大胆地回答我的提问。“嘿嘿！竞赛书寄出后，到现在不几天就增加了几十头猪啦！”又一位女饲养员充满信心地参与进来。
    “没变化，我们的张模范的席子差点擦烂了（心里有事睡不着的意思）。”装料的饲养员这样告诉我。
    “你怎么知道她是在考虑一亩田一头猪的事呢？”我追问她道。
    “怎么不是呢？你听我说呀：那天，噢，是9月13日的下午，我听我们大队长对她说，明年3月我们要实现一亩田一头猪，要她问问饲养员有没有信心？……就在这天晚上，我醒过几遍，听见她还翻来复去地没有睡着。第二天，她就召集我们开会。我预料一定是要端出她昨夜的意见，果然一点不差。她说：‘要实现一亩田一头猪，每头母猪在明年3月份前要生一窝小猪，每窝要保证生九只才够数。我昨夜想了一下，凭着我们已有的经验，只要大家进一步鼓足干劲，认真地做好精、粗饲料、青饲料、多质饲料的搭配，增强母猪的身体，使母猪提早发情，2月份所有母猪就可以生一窝小猪；再说，母猪身体好，可全部推行双重交配，每窝小猪数可大大超过大队的要求。’你看，我没有猜错吧！”
    在青年养猪场后面，基建组正在紧张地建筑新房。我从领导养猪的大队长林明江口里知道，这是为新饲养员们盖的住宅，一共有三大间。
    “今天是凤岗墟，大家怎么不去赶墟？”
    “你为什么不去赶墟呢？”一位调皮的小伙子反问我道。
    “我是有紧要事来找你们队长的。”
    “我们一亩田一头猪也很要紧呀！”我们一唱一和，使大家禁不住的笑了。林明江对我说，根据一亩田一头猪的计划，需要增加二十多个饲养员，这些人将陆续抽调出来，急需要住宿的地方。当基建组的同志接受建房任务后，就提出了“早上工，晚收工，无事不上墟，一定提前完成任务”的保证。因此，施工后的第一个墟日，没有一个人歇工。我来到这个工地虽是晌午时分，该休息了，可是大家还是干得那么欢，他们的积极性是多么高涨呵！
