This report: Zhejiang Province's more than 100,000-strong basic construction army, holding high the red flag of the General Line, striving for high-speed construction, after ten months of hard work, by October 25th, had completed the state-assigned basic construction plan for this year 67 days ahead of schedule, exceeding the target by 3.6%, and has greatly surpassed the basic construction tasks of the province's second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

In completing this year's tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding targets, a total of 149 individual projects were completed, with a total construction area of 890,000 square meters. The new production capacity added by the industrial projects completed this year mainly includes: 170,000 tons of iron smelting, 110,000 tons of steel smelting, 223,300 tons of steel, 230,000 tons of coke, 10,000 tons of cast iron pipes, 500 tons of electrolytic aluminum, 37,627 kilowatts of power generation capacity, 10,000 tons of sulfuric acid, 5,180 tons of caustic soda, 100,000 tons of cement, 50,000 spindles, 4,000 tons of refined sugar, and 6,340 tons of machine-made paper.

The completion of industrial construction projects in Zhejiang this year plays a significant role in ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of this year's industrial production plan, supporting agricultural production, and improving people's lives. For example, the completion of metallurgical projects has increased iron smelting capacity by 40% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, and steel smelting capacity has increased threefold. After the completion and commissioning of the dichlorvos workshop of the Hangzhou Pesticide Factory, a number of farmlands in Zhejiang were spared and reduced insect damage. The full commissioning of the fine spinning workshop of the Xiaoshan Cotton Textile Factory has further advanced Zhejiang's cotton textile industry. Zhejiang's silk industry, known as the "Silk Capital," has also added new silk looms.

Zhejiang Province's basic construction front's early and overfulfilled plan is the result of vigorously engaging in mass movements. Due to the conscientious implementation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a mass movement against right-leaning ideas, encouraging hard work, and practicing increased production and thrift was rapidly launched throughout the province, carrying out a six-way competition comparing speed, quality, cost, material savings, labor productivity, and safety, creating a surging construction upsurge everywhere, with everyone chasing and surpassing each other. In this way, construction quotas are constantly refreshed, project progress is accelerating every day, news of creation and innovation is frequently reported, and new people and new things are constantly emerging. For example, in the Ruian Sugar Factory project, after the masses were mobilized, more than 180 rationalization proposals were put forward within three days, which not only saved a large amount of steel and cement, but also advanced the construction period by two months. With the increasing upsurge of the mass movement, the amount of work completed each month in the province increased month by month. August increased by 8.1% compared with July, September increased sharply by 27.5% compared with August, and October increased by another 40.1% compared with September.

Now, the vast number of workers on the basic construction front in Zhejiang Province are continuing to thoroughly oppose right-leaning ideas, boost their energy, vigorously engage in mass movements, and make great efforts in technical innovation, in order to complete 182 individual projects ahead of schedule in the fourth quarter, further exceed the state-assigned basic construction plan, and actively prepare for the continued leap forward in basic construction next year, advancing victoriously.

This report: The workers of the construction system in Guizhou Province have completed this year's basic construction plan ahead of schedule by two months on October 31, exceeding the target by 0.39%. A total of 950 sub-projects have been delivered for use and completed, with an area of more than 850,000 square meters. Guizhou's first modern cotton textile factory and Guizhou Cement Factory, which were newly built, have been partially put into production.

After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the basic construction workers in Guizhou Province launched an increase production and conservation campaign, fighting hard in August and September, to present gifts to the National Day. More than 90% of the teams and groups in the province's construction industry carried out same-trade competitions. Through evaluation, they launched a "learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced" movement, making the red flag competition deeper and more extensive, and promoting the technical reform movement, which greatly improved labor efficiency. For example, carpenters, concrete workers, and bricklayers of the Fourth Construction Company carried out a technical innovation movement and quickly realized semi-mechanized operation. Qiao Yinzeng's carpentry team of the Mechanized Construction General Station trial-produced five kinds of machines, such as a cutting machine, a surface planer, and a drilling machine, in four days, which respectively increased work efficiency by 15 to 30 times, making it possible to complete the October plan ahead of schedule by thirteen days.

This report: More than 100,000 basic construction workers in Shaanxi Province, on the basis of overfulfilling the basic construction tasks in the third quarter, continued to implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and launched a vigorous competition upsurge of comparing tasks, comparing measures, comparing enthusiasm, and learning from advanced, catching up with advanced, and surpassing advanced.

In the competition, new records emerged in various units, and the winning red flag was frequently passed back and forth between the competitors. On the first day, Kang Zhenhua's ordinary worker pacesetter team of the Fourth Construction Site of the Second Engineering Department of the Fourth Construction Engineering Company of Shaanxi Province won the red flag with an achievement of exceeding 55% in mixing loess. On the second day, Li Yongxiang's ordinary worker team snatched the red flag with an achievement of exceeding 83%. Then, Kang Zhenhua's team reorganized the labor organization and launched a heated competition within the team. On the third day, it snatched the red flag back with an achievement of exceeding 102%. At this time, Yang Zhongxin's ordinary worker team also rose up to participate in the battle, and on the fourth day, it snatched the red flag with an achievement of exceeding 175%. Other types of work also participated in the battle. Li Rongsheng's carpentry team worked hard for three days and snatched the red flag with an achievement of exceeding 235%. After Li Rongsheng's team won the red flag, Xu Junhui's ordinary worker team proposed a decisive battle with Li Rongsheng's team. As a result, Xu Junhui's team won with an achievement of exceeding 241% and won the red flag. In this way, the entire construction site quickly launched a tense, fierce, and complex competition movement, and as a result, all 59 teams and groups overfulfilled their tasks.

In this competition movement, many units systematically summarized the advanced experience of each type of work and each process, so that the production efficiency of each type of work and each process could be improved evenly and rapidly. For example, the Shaanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau system recently summarized the machinery, tools, and advanced operating techniques for carpentry, ramming, and bricklaying, concentrated the advantages of the same types of work in various units, and selected a complete set of advanced tools and production experience. Among them, carpentry production from cutting, planing, drilling, opening water, to assembly, all realized mechanization, and was comprehensively promoted. This year, the task of painting the key projects put into production in the province in the fourth quarter reached 1.8 million square meters, which required tens of thousands of workdays to complete. According to the existing painters, only 66% of the tasks can be completed in the fourth quarter. In order to ensure the early completion of the annual plan and ensure that key construction projects are put into production ahead of schedule, various companies have transferred the most outstanding painting worker teams to concentrate on key projects to carry out face-to-face competition, summarize a complete set of advanced experience, and make the painting work efficiency increase by an average of one time.

By the 6th of this month, the construction and installation workers in the province had completed the annual planned workload 55 days ahead of schedule, an increase of 46% compared with the same period last year. In the past ten months, the province has completed a construction area of more than 1.2 million square meters, and a total of 578 projects have been delivered for use. The construction and installation tasks this year have not only been completed quickly and in large quantities, but have also generally achieved high quality, safety, and low cost. In the past ten months, high-quality projects accounted for more than 80% of all construction projects, and cost reductions were more than double the plan. Now, they are focusing on the finishing works, concentrating superior forces to fight "annihilation battles" to ensure that key construction projects are put into production ahead of schedule.

    加快工程进度　不断刷新纪录
    浙江、贵州提前超额完成全年基本建设任务
    陕西高举快速优质安全低成本红旗全面跃进
    本报讯　浙江省十多万基本建设大军，高举总路线红旗，力争高速度建设，经过十个月来的奋战，到10月25日，已经提前六十七天，超额3.6％完成了国家下达的今年基本建设计划，并已大大提前超额完成全省第二个五年计划的基本建设任务。
    在提前超额完成今年任务中，共建成了一百四十九个单项工程，完成总的建筑面积为八十九万平方米。今年建成的工业项目，新增加的生产能力主要有：炼铁十七万吨，炼钢十一万吨，钢材二十二万三千吨，炼焦二十三万吨，铸铁管一万吨，电解铝五百吨，发电装机容量三万七千六百二十七瓩，硫酸一万吨，烧碱五千一百八十吨，水泥十万吨，纱锭五万枚，机制糖四千吨，机制纸六千三百四十吨。
    浙江今年工业建设项目的完成，对保证完成和超额完成今年工业生产计划、支援农业生产和改善人民生活起着重大作用。如：冶金工程的建成，炼铁能力比特大跃进的1958年还增加40％，炼钢能力增加三倍。杭州农药厂敌百虫车间投入生产后，可使浙江一批农田免除和减少虫害。萧山棉纺织厂细纺车间全部投入生产后，又使浙江棉纺织工业迈进了一大步。被称为“丝绸之府”的浙江丝绸工业，也新增加了织绸机。
    浙江省基本建设战线提前超额完成计划，是大搞群众运动的结果。由于认真贯彻执行了党的八届八中全会决议，在全省范围内迅速开展了反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的群众运动，开展了比进度、比质量、比成本、比节约材料、比劳动生产率、比安全的六比竞赛，处处出现一片汹涌澎湃、你追我赶的建设热潮。这样，施工定额不断刷新，工程进度天天加快，创造革新捷报频传，新人新事不断涌现。如瑞安糖厂工程，群众发动起来后，三天内就提出一百八十多条合理化建议，不但节约了大量钢材水泥，而且工期提前二个月。随着群众运动的日益高涨，全省每月完成工作量月月上升。8月份比7月增长8.1％，9月比8月猛增27.5％，10月又比9月增长40.1％。
    现在，浙江省基本建设战线上广大职工，正在继续反透右倾，鼓足干劲，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新，为在第四季度提前完成一百八十二个单项工程，更多地超额完成国家下达的基本建设计划，并积极做好明年基本建设继续跃进的准备工作而乘胜前进。　（金大真）
    本报讯　贵州省建筑系统职工，已提前两个月在10月31日超额0.39％完成今年基本建设计划。交付使用和竣工的有九百五十个分项工程，面积达八十五万多平方米。新建的贵州第一座现代化棉纺织厂和贵州水泥厂，已部分投入生产。
    贵州省基本建设职工，在党的八届八中全会以后，掀起了大战8、9月，向国庆献礼的增产节约运动；全省建筑90％以上的队、组，开展了同工种对手赛，通过评比，又展开了“学先进，赶先进，超先进”运动；使红旗竞赛更加深入、广泛，推动了技术改革运动，大大提高劳动效率。如第四建筑公司的木工、混凝土工、砖工等，开展了技术革新运动，很快实现半机械化操作。机械化施工总站乔寅增木工队，四天试制成断料机、平面刨、钻眼机等五种机器，分别提高工效十五至三十倍，使10月份计划提前十三天超额完成。
    本报讯　陕西省十余万基本建设职工，在超额完成第三季度基建任务的基础上，继续贯彻八届八中全会的精神，掀起了一个声势浩大的比任务、比措施、比干劲和学先进、赶先进、超先进的竞赛高潮。
    竞赛中，各单位的新纪录层出不尽，优胜红旗在竞赛对手之间往复频传。陕西省第四建筑工程公司第二工程处第四工地康振华普工标兵小组第一天以拌灰土超额55％的成绩得了红旗，第二天李永祥普工小队就以超额83％的成绩夺走了红旗，接着，康振华小组，又重新调整了劳动组织，在组内发动了热火朝天的竞赛，第三天就以超额102％的成绩把红旗夺了回来。这时，杨忠信普工小队也奋起参战，第四天以超额175％的成绩夺走了红旗。其他工种也纷纷参战。李荣升木工小组苦战三天，以超额235％的成绩夺走了红旗。李荣升小组夺得红旗以后，许俊辉普工小组便提出和李荣升小组决战，结果许俊辉小组以超额241％的成绩获胜，得了红旗。全工地就这样迅速展开了紧张激烈、错综复杂的竞赛运动，结果五十九个队组都超额完成了任务。
    在这次竞赛运动中，许多单位系统地总结了每个工种和每道工序的先进经验，使各工种、各个工序的生产效率都能均衡而迅速地提高。例如，陕西省建筑工程局系统最近对木工、打夯、砌砖等工种的机械、工具和先进操作技术进行了总结，集中了各单位同工种的优点，评选出成套的先进工具和生产经验。其中木工生产由截料、刨光、打眼、开水、直到组装，全部实现机械化，并且全面加以推广。今年第四季度全省投入生产的重点工程的粉刷任务达一百八十万平方米，需要几万个劳动日才能完成。按现有的粉刷工计算，四季度只能完成任务66％。为了保证提前完成全年计划，保证重点建设项目提前投入生产，各公司抽调了最优秀的粉刷工小组，集中在重点工程上展开面对面的竞赛，总结出成套的先进经验，使粉刷工作效率平均提高一倍。
    到本月6日，全省建筑安装职工提前五十五天完成了全年计划工作量，比去年同期增长了46％。十个月来，全省共完成建筑面积一百二十多万平方米，共有五百七十八项工程交付使用。今年的建筑安装任务不仅完成的又快又多，而且一般作到了优质、安全和低成本。十个月来，优等工程占全部施工项目的80％以上，降低成本比计划多一倍以上。现在，他们正大抓收尾工程，集中优势兵力打“歼灭战”，以保证重点建设项目提前投入生产。
