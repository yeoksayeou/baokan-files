    Heroes Return to Work
    Our Correspondent
    The heroes from the capital who attended the National Congress of Heroes, carrying the earnest expectations of the Party and unparalleled honor, returned to their work posts amidst the deafening sounds of gongs, drums, and firecrackers.
    The return of the heroes has stirred up even higher waves in the surging torrent of continued leap forward on the city's economic front.
    Advanced ideas and advanced experiences are boiling and spreading in Beijing.

    Reporting Grand Visions and Lofty Ambitions to the Party
    As the heroes from all fronts were about to return to their respective posts, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China met with them.
    The responsible comrades of the Municipal Committee requested the representatives to spread the seeds of advancement throughout Beijing, and called on all workers in the city to learn from the most advanced levels in the country, to transform the advanced levels into the production levels of the entire society, and to let a spring of advanced examples and a riot of color appear on the city's industrial, transportation, basic construction, and financial and trade fronts!
    At the meeting, heroes from all fronts eagerly expressed their determination to the Party:
    "The more tasks there are in the capital's basic construction, the greater our enthusiasm will be. We will definitely complete the tasks even more outstandingly and dedicate our youth to the socialist construction of the motherland." - This was the voice of Zhang Baifa, captain of the youth steel bar commando team.
    "We must play the role of a locomotive, go full steam ahead, and pull and run more for the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production." - This was the vow of Cai Lianxing, the driver of the Mao Zedong locomotive.
    "My skills were taught by the Party, and my strength was given by the Party. The glory I have obtained should be attributed to the Party. After returning, I will definitely ensure that the entire team's mail delivery work reaches the advanced national level." - The famous postman Luo Shuzhen expressed her lofty ambition.
    The call of the Beijing Municipal Committee quickly turned into practical actions in various factories and mines. When the heroes from all fronts returned to their factories, the Party committees of many units held meetings to listen to the representatives' reports on the situation of the Congress and determined measures to quickly promote advanced experiences.

    Leap Forward Tidings Add Enthusiasm
    Liu Yajun, the young female lathe operator who dares to think and dares to act, and who had advanced into 1963 ahead of schedule, was surrounded by welcoming people as she entered the factory. She arrived just as everyone was holding big-character posters to congratulate the component workshop for completing its annual task fifty-one days ahead of schedule.
    "So fast!" Liu Yajun, with excitement, also went with everyone to the component workshop to congratulate them. As she walked, she began talking with Wu Xiuhua and other young female workers from this workshop who had come to welcome her. Many young workers like Wu Xiuhua had been taking Liu Yajun as an example, learning from her, and catching up with her. Wu Xiuhua improved insulation testing and increased work efficiency nine times, making one person equal to four and a half people.
    When Liu Yajun arrived at her lathe, something even more surprising happened: Wu Fenglan, a seventeen-year-old apprentice who had never touched a machine tool before, was standing at her workbench, skillfully operating it. In the ten days or so she was away at the conference, Xiao Wu had already completed two and a half months' worth of work. Liu Yajun's ideas of "Time is wealth" and "Difficulties bow to me" had become Xiao Wu's practical actions.
    Wu Fenglan was not the only one leaping forward. In the Changxindian Communications Factory, batches of Liu Yajun-style workers have emerged in recent days. A month ago, only a little over a hundred workers in the factory had advanced into 1960 ahead of schedule. Now, the factory already has five hundred and sixty-nine people who have advanced into 1960, 1961... ahead of schedule.
    These leap forward facts added to Liu Yajun's enthusiasm, and a new leap forward plan emerged in her mind: she must leap even further this year! Yan Hetian, the second secretary of the Party committee, seemed to have already seen Liu Yajun's thoughts, patted her on the shoulder and said kindly, "Don't worry, your work has already been prepared for you." The factory director also added, "This time, the job given to you is a difficult one." Liu Yajun smiled confidently and replied, "Difficulties should be left to me!"

    Always Striving to Be the Best
    When Chen Suzhi, a Jia Ganova-style textile worker from the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, returned to the workshop, she was greeted by a piece of good news that she had been dreaming of: Class C of the fourth work area where she worked had shaken off the burden of being the "downstream class" for seventeen months and, on the 11th, became the "upstream class" in terms of quality and output for the first time in the entire work area.
    Chen Suzhi was transferred from an advanced class to this class in September of this year. With her help, the whole class took on a new look. More than ten days ago, the sisters of Class C wrote to her: resolutely strive to be the quality leader in November. Now, this vow has been realized ahead of schedule.
    The whole work area was a sensation because of this event, and the workers called it "groundbreaking" news. However, Chen Suzhi thought far beyond this. She said to the Party committee secretary, "Now that we have become the upstream, we cannot be complacent. We must not only maintain this honor but also continue to improve. People are chasing closely, so you have to run faster, otherwise, you will fall back to the downstream again!"
    This twenty-two-year-old advanced female worker was not only considering the problem of her own class. After talking to the Party committee secretary, she immediately went to find Wang Fengxiao and Yu Shiqing, the "pacesetters" of Class A and Class B, who were her competition rivals, to discuss establishing a "sister contract." Chen Suzhi expressed that she wanted to humbly learn advanced technologies from them, and that the three classes must unite, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, so that everyone can be advanced.

    Striving to Have More People Receive Medals
    Bai Sh茂, the advanced collective representative and worker from the electric furnace workshop of the Beijing Steel Plant, immediately plunged into the operation in front of the furnace upon returning to the factory.
    The flames of the electric furnace illuminated the hero's face with a radiant glow, and the entire workshop was filled with cheers.
    Bai Sh茂 promoted the rapid steelmaking method created by the Dalian Steel Plant on his electric furnace. Holding a pickaxe, he said to his partners: We must make the first shot a success. The six young men in the group quickly ran to the front of the furnace and began the battle of charging materials. The materials that used to take a quarter of an hour to charge two days ago now only take eight minutes.
    The first assistant, Hou Deqiang, and the workers poured four tons of material in one breath. Pointing to the group hero's medal on Bai Sh茂's chest, he said: Seeing the red flag and Chairman Mao's portrait on it, I feel even more enthusiastic. We must strive to have more people receive medals next year with even more outstanding achievements!

    英雄们回到工作岗位
    本报记者
    首都出席全国群英大会的英雄们，带着党的殷切的期望和无尚的荣誉，在喧天的锣鼓和鞭炮声中，回到自己的工作岗位。
    英雄们的归来，使全市经济战线上正在汹涌澎湃继续跃进的洪流，激起了更高的浪涛。
    先进思想和先进经验在北京沸腾着，传播着。
    向党报告宏图雄心
    在各路英雄即将回到各自岗位的时候，中共北京市委接见了他们。
    市委的负责同志要求代表们把先进的种子撒遍全北京，号召全市职工向全国最先进的水平学习，把先进的水平变成全社会的生产水平，让全市工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸战线上出现一个先进如林、万紫千红的春天！
    会上，各路英雄争着向党表示决心：
    “首都基本建设的任务越多，我们的干劲也就越大。回去一定更出色地完成任务，把青春献给祖国社会主义建设事业。”——这是青年钢筋突击队队长张百发的声音。
    “我们一定要发挥火车头的作用，开足马力，为工农业生产继续跃进多拉快跑。”——这是毛泽东号机车司机长蔡连兴的誓言。
    “我的本领是党教给的，力量也是党给的，我得到的这些光荣应当归功于党。回去以后，一定保证全组投递邮件工作达到全国先进水平。”——著名邮递员罗淑珍表示了自己的雄心。
    北京市委的号召，迅速变成各厂矿的实际行动。当各路英雄回厂时，许多单位的党委都召开会议，听取了代表们关于大会情况的汇报，确定了迅速推广先进经验的措施。
    跃进喜讯增添干劲
    敢想敢干，提前跨进1963年的青年女车工刘雅君被欢迎的人簇拥着走进工厂，正赶上大家拿着大字报准备给提前五十一天完成全年任务的元件车间贺喜。
    “真快呀！”刘雅君怀着激动的心情，也和大家一起到元件车间去贺喜。她一边走着，一边就和这个车间来欢迎她的青年女工吴秀华等谈开了。吴秀华等许多青年工人一直以刘雅君为榜样，在学习她，追赶她。吴秀华改进了测试绝缘，一下就把工作效率提高九倍，一个人顶上四个半人。
    当刘雅君来到自己的车床边，一个更使她惊喜的事情出现了：从来没有摸过机床的十七岁徒工邬凤兰，正站在她的工作台上熟练地操作着。小邬在她去开会的十多天中，已经完成了两个半月的工作量。“时间就是财富”、“困难向我低头”，刘雅君的这些思想，已经成为小邬的实际行动了。
    飞跃前进的还不是小邬一个人。在长辛店通信工厂，这些天来已经出现了成批的刘雅君式的工人。一个月前全厂只有一百多工人提前跨进1960年，现在全厂已有五百六十九人提前跨进了1960年、1961年……。
    这些跃进事实使刘雅君增添了干劲，她的脑子里浮现起一个新的跃进计划：一定要在今年跨得更远些！党委第二书记阎鹤田好像已经看出了刘雅君的心事，拍了一下她的肩膀亲切地说：“别着急，你的工作已经给你准备好了。”厂长也接着说：“这回给你的可是难活。”刘雅君满怀信心地笑着回答：“应该把困难留给我！”
    永远争上游
    北京第二棉纺织厂加干诺娃式的纺织女工陈素芝回到车间时，迎接她的是她朝思暮想的一个好消息：她所在的四工区丙班已经甩掉背了十七个月的“下游班”的包袱，11日第一次成为全工区质量、产量的“上游班”。
    陈素芝今年9月份从先进班调到这个班。在她的帮助下，全班出现了新气象。十多天以前，丙班姊妹们曾经写信告诉她：坚决在11月里争得质量上游。现在，这个誓言提前实现了。
    全工区都为这件事轰动了，工人们把它称做“开天辟地”的新闻。陈素芝听到这个消息却想得很远。她对党委书记说：“现在得了上游，可不能怠慢。我们不仅要保持住这个光荣，还要继续提高。人家追的紧，你就得跑的更快，不然，就会再落到下游！”
    这位二十二岁的先进女工所考虑的还不只是她们本班的问题。她同党委书记谈完话，马上就去找竞赛的对手——甲班和乙班的“标兵”王凤霄、于世卿，酝酿订立“姊妹合同”。陈素芝表示要虚心向她们学习先进技术，一定要做到三班团结，取长补短，使大家都先进。
    争取更多的人挂奖章
    先进集体代表、北京钢厂电炉车间工人白树茂，一回厂便紧张地投入了炉前操作。
    电炉的火焰照得英雄红光满面，全车间一片欢腾。
    白树茂在自己的电炉上推行了大连钢厂创造的快速炼钢法。他拿着洋镐对伙伴们说：咱们一定要把第一炮打响。全组六个小伙子迅速跑到炉前，展开了投料的战斗。在两天前一刻钟才能投完的料，现在只用八分钟就投完了。
    第一助手侯德强和工人们一鼓作气投进了四吨料。他指着白树茂胸前的群英会奖章说：看到那上面的红旗和毛主席的胸像，心里就产生出更大的热劲儿。我们一定要以更出色的成绩，争取明年有更多的人挂上奖章！
