Dear Chairman, most respected Comrade Zhu De, dear Comrade Li Xiannian, dear comrades and friends:

    Please allow me, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, and the entire Albanian people, to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries of the People's Republic of China, the Sino-Albanian Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Women's Federation, and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles for holding this grand celebration rally for the 15th anniversary of Albania's liberation. I also extend my warm gratitude to the representatives from all walks of life of the glorious capital of the People's Republic of China, Beijing, who are attending this celebration rally.

    Fifteen years ago, on November 29, 1944, the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Communist Party, now the Labor Party, having undergone five years of arduous struggle, forever freed themselves from the dual oppression and exploitation of imperialism and the domestic feudal-bourgeois class. On November 29, 1944, the Albanian working class, working peasants, and all progressive patriotic forces who were with them, under the leadership of the Party, victoriously completed the people's revolution. They drove out the fascist occupation forces, overthrew the old feudal-bourgeois regime, and established a new people's regime, the regime of the people themselves.

    The Albanian people's revolution was completed under specific historical conditions, namely, the existence of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's participation in World War II, and the Soviet people's world-historic victory over fascist forces. If the Soviet Union had not participated in World War II and had not defeated the reactionary forces in this war, the Albanian people would not have been liberated, and there would be no People's Republic of Albania today.

    Albania's Liberation Day, November 29, 1944, is a day of great significance in the history of the Albanian people. It marks the beginning of a new historical period, the beginning of a new happy life for our people. Fifteen years have passed since then, which is a very short period in the history of a people. But during this period, the Albanian people, under the leadership of their Labor Party, with selfless labor and with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in the first place, have carried out a series of tremendous historical reforms in the economic, political, social, and cultural fields. To better understand how tremendous the victories achieved during this period were, it is necessary to first understand Albania before the war. Pre-war Albania was the most backward country in Europe, both economically and politically. It was a backward agricultural country with almost no industry, a weak working class, and a very small population. More than 80% of the population was illiterate. It was a semi-colonial country, where banks and all financial institutions were controlled by foreign capitalists. Rich underground resources: oil, iron, chromium, asphalt, etc., as well as the most fertile land were leased by foreign imperialist trusts. The aggression of Nazi fascists and five years of war further destroyed Albania's weak economy and further deteriorated the economic conditions of the Albanian people. In the five-year anti-fascist war, the Albanian people paid a great price in terms of both human and material resources. For example, the number of casualties and missing persons reached 6.4% of the total population, or 70,000 people, 21% of rural housing was burned down, one-third of the livestock was lost, all original factories and mines were paralyzed, highways, bridges, ports and other means of transportation were destroyed, and the people's property stored in the Albanian National Bank was looted by the fascists.

    What the people's regime inherited was a very low productive force, an extremely backward and weak economy, and the war left us with serious wounds. However, the people's regime, from its establishment, implemented the Party's instructions based on Marxist-Leninist doctrines, and adopted a series of very important economic and social measures in order to completely destroy the old relations of production, lay the foundation for restoring the damaged economy in the shortest possible period, and for the planned development of the national economy and culture. The people's regime immediately recovered foreign leases, nationalized mines, banks, and major transportation, and implemented state monopoly over foreign trade. We also carried out land reform, forever destroying the semi-feudal relations of production in agricultural production, and at the same time, we carried out educational reform to make education and culture serve the people. In addition, a series of other measures favorable to the broad masses of the people were taken. The Albanian people immediately responded to the Party's call to restore and build the country. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Hoxha, the Albanian people, full of enthusiasm and with new redoubled strength, resolutely threw themselves into creative construction work. Albania became a huge construction site. With unprecedented speed, the Albanian people overcame the serious difficulties caused by the long-term backwardness of the past and the lack of experience and various materials, and struggled against the imperialists and their servants who were engaged in open or secret activities, especially the Yugoslav leaders who interfered in our internal affairs. Under the Party's slogan of "holding a pick in one hand and a weapon in the other," damaged highways, bridges, factories, and mines were restored, and new houses and schools were built on the ruins. New factories, mines, the first railway, and the first hydropower stations were built one after another. A new life also began in the Albanian countryside, and the first cooperatives were established. The first tractors and other agricultural machines also appeared in the Albanian fields. At the same time, education, art, and culture also achieved unprecedented development. A vigorous literacy campaign was carried out, and literacy classes were established everywhere in enterprises, construction sites, rural areas, and government offices. The network of primary and secondary schools expanded many times over, and the first technical schools and institutions of higher learning were established. For the first time after liberation, vocational theaters were established, and theaters, opera and ballet theaters, operetta theaters, national orchestras, national song and dance troupes, and countless other cultural groups were established. At the same time, a film studio was established, and films were produced domestically for the first time.

    Thus, after a period of intense and selfless labor, the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Labor Party and with the fraternal assistance of socialist countries, created the conditions for the planned development of the economy and culture and embarked smoothly on the road of socialist construction.

    In socialist construction, the Albanian Labor Party, following Marxist-Leninist doctrines, adopted the valuable experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism and the experience of other fraternal parties, and also formulated a three-year plan (1948-1950) and the subsequent first five-year plan (1951-1955) for developing the national economy and culture based on the objective conditions of our country. Due to the victorious completion of the above plans, the productive forces of the People's Republic of Albania have been significantly improved. The Albanian people are now striving to complete and overfulfill the tasks of the fourth year of the second five-year plan adopted by the Third Congress of the Albanian Labor Party in June 1956. The victorious completion of the first five-year plan and the first two years of the second five-year plan made it possible to greatly revise and expand the targets of the second five-year plan. These additions were made at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party held in February 1958, which predicted that the total industrial and agricultural output in 1960 would increase by nearly one-fold compared to 1955.

    Dear comrades and friends!

    The Albanian people happily celebrate their National Day every year with new achievements, but this year they are celebrating the 15th anniversary of their liberation under different conditions than in the past. A vigorous socialist emulation has been unfolded in our country long ago, and large numbers of workers' collectives are constantly reporting to the Party and the government that they have completed and overfulfilled their production plans. Many workers have already completed this year's tasks and started the work tasks for 1960. This year, the material and cultural living standards of the working people of our country are constantly improving, and they are full of confidence in a bright future and great and bright prospects. Like in the past, they are firmly advancing along the path of socialist construction pointed out by the beloved Party at a faster pace, and they are celebrating their National Day with unprecedented achievements and victories.

    Dear comrades, please allow me to describe some of the achievements the Albanian people have made in the past fifteen years.

    During this period, industry has developed tremendously. Our Party has always been concerned about the country's socialist industrialization. This is natural and necessary. As you know, before the war, Albania's total industrial output accounted for only 9.8% of the country's total industrial and agricultural output. However, by the end of 1958, Albania's industrial output value had increased by 17.8 times compared to before the war (1938). By the end of 1959, it will increase to 22 times. This task has already been completed in the first three quarters of this year, that is, the plan for this period has been completed by 103.9%, which is 125.1% of the same period last year. In the past fifteen years, the original industrial sectors have been expanded and modernized with equipment, and at the same time, many new sectors have been established, and the exploitation of rich underground mineral resources has also made tremendous progress. In the recent ten years, the socialist industry with modern equipment has grown at an average annual rate of 19%. The characteristic of our country's industrial development is that it is based on domestic raw materials. Due to such rapid growth in our country's industrial production, the industrial products that could only be produced in one year before the war now only take sixteen days to produce. To better understand the growth of industrial production in Albania, it may be useful to list the following examples: calculated on a per capita basis, the industrial output value in 1938 was 1,330 leks, while in 1959 it increased to 19,763 leks.

    All sectors of our country's industry are developing rapidly. For example, compared with before the war (1938), in 1959, electricity industry production increased by 18 times, oil industry production increased by 17.25 times, coal industry production increased by 76.65 times, chromium ore mining increased by 35.5 times, machinery industry production increased by 16.6 times, timber industry production increased by 52 times, light industry production increased by 21.4 times, textile industry production increased by 61 times, and food industry production increased by 15.5 times.

    On the basis of the achievements already made in industry, the People's Republic of Albania has been able to shorten the huge distance that existed between it and other countries, especially neighboring countries, in industry in a short period of time. In terms of the output of several products, the output per capita has caught up with or exceeded that of neighboring countries. For example, in terms of chromium production, Albania has ranked sixth in the world, and if calculated on a per capita basis, it has ranked first in the world. In terms of oil production, Albania has surpassed Italy, Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Egypt, etc., on a per capita basis. In terms of coal and iron production, Albania has also surpassed Italy, Greece, and Turkey, on a per capita basis. In 1957, Albania's electricity and cement production, if calculated on a per capita basis, were 30% and 20% higher than Turkey's production in 1956, respectively. Now, in Albania, every person can obtain 15 meters of cotton cloth per year on a per capita basis, which also exceeds Turkey, Italy, and Greece.

    The speed of Albania's industrial development has never been seen in any capitalist country. The achievements made in industry in the past fifteen years once again prove the vitality and superiority of the socialist system. If Albania had developed along the path of the past feudal-bourgeois system, it would have taken at least 140 years to reach the industrial production level of 1960, and the investment in one year in 1958 was equivalent to the total investment in the past 70 years.

    The above achievements are also Albania's small contribution to the peaceful competition between the two systems.

    During this period, the People's Republic of Albania has also achieved significant achievements in agriculture and the socialist transformation of agriculture. The Party and the People's Government, noting the past backwardness of our country's agriculture, have always attached great importance to the development of agriculture. Due to the constant measures taken by the Party and the government, by 1960, the area of cultivated land will be 204.5% of that in 1938. This year's agricultural output has increased by 173% compared to 1938. In the past ten years, the total agricultural output has increased by an average of 8.8% per year. Great importance has been attached to the mechanization of agriculture. Today, our country's agriculture has 3,837 tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower), that is, an average of 4.5 tractors per 1,000 hectares of land, 216 combines, and many other agricultural machines. We are also constantly adopting advanced agricultural technologies. In order to eliminate the waterlogging and drought disasters in agriculture, we have dug a series of irrigation ditches and carried out soil improvement work. Farms have been established on the desolate swamps of the past. We have planted crops that have never been planted before. Economic crops, horticulture, citrus, and grapes have been greatly developed.

    The greatest achievement in our country's agriculture is the imminent completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture. Today, more than 69.6% of the peasant households, occupying 81.5% of the cultivated land, have joined agricultural cooperatives. Socialist components account for 89.5% of the cultivated land in agriculture, which occupies a dominant position in agriculture, and most of the agricultural products are provided by it.

    During this period, the Albanian people have also achieved brilliant achievements in education and culture and art. Illiteracy has been eliminated. Now every rural area has its own school, and primary education and seven-year education in several cities have been made compulsory. In the 1959-1960 school year, the number of students enrolled reached 231,500, which is equal to 4.45 times the number of students before the war. In 1957, on the basis of the original institutions of higher learning, the National University of Tirana was established for the first time in Albania's history. This year, there are 2,948 university students studying at the National University of Tirana and other institutions of higher learning. In addition, hundreds of university students are studying at institutions of higher learning in the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries. Many people have participated in correspondence school studies without leaving their jobs. Now one out of every five people in our republic is studying. Our theatrical troupes have staged immortal classical music and classical drama works, such as: "Eugene Onegin," "Ivan Susanin," "La Traviata," and "The White-Haired Girl," etc. Our theaters are now also staging works by Shakespeare, Chekhov, Gorky, and other writers. Last year, our first opera "Mrika" was also performed. This year, the Higher School of Drama was also opened. Before this, the art middle school and the affiliated dance school of the Opera and Ballet Theater were established. In addition, we have also started to produce art films ourselves.

    The same achievements have been made in other sectors of the economy, culture, and healthcare. Due to these achievements, our country's national income has increased, and the material and cultural living standards of our people have been incomparably improved compared with the pre-war period. Now, the Albanian people's clothing, food, and housing have been better improved, and today's cultural life is something that the people of the past could not have dreamed of. During this period, the Albanian population increased by 400,000, that is, an average increase of 30 people per 1,000 people per year. This is a vivid example of the happy life of our people.

    While carrying out economic and cultural construction, our country's independence has also been increasingly consolidated, and the prestige of the People's Republic of Albania on the international stage has also been enhanced. The era when Albania was a commodity for buying and selling among imperialist countries is gone forever. Albania today is a free and independent socialist country. It is an active member of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Treaty. It has established diplomatic relations with twenty-three countries. It is a member of the United Nations and other international organizations. Because the People's Republic of Albania has consistently pursued a policy of defending and consolidating peace, as well as a policy of peaceful coexistence and good neighborliness, it is an important factor in defending peace in the Balkans and Europe.

    Due to these achievements made so far, Albania has changed from a backward agricultural country to an agricultural-industrial country, and is now rapidly moving along the road of building our country into an industrial-agricultural country. This has been stipulated in the third five-year plan formulated by the Party and the government.

    Comrades, the reason why the Albanian people have been able to achieve these achievements is due to their selfless labor and high spirit of patriotism. These achievements have also been achieved in the struggle against various difficulties and obstacles, and in the struggle against the imperialists and their lackeys who vainly attempt to interfere in our internal affairs, overthrow the people's regime, and establish the feudal-bourgeois regime hated by the people.

    These achievements of the Albanian people should be attributed to the correct leadership of the Albanian Labor Party. Our Party, following Marxist-Leninist doctrines and the principles of proletarian internationalism, and also absorbing the general experience of the Soviet mother party and other fraternal parties, mobilized and led the Albanian people to achieve the victory of the people's revolution and to carry out socialist construction smoothly.

    In the past fifteen years, the Albanian people have marched forward in great strides under the glorious banner of the Party. They have experienced a difficult and glorious road, and they have completely changed the face of their beloved motherland. The swamps that used to be on the Albanian territory have now become a green fertile field, and new factories and beautiful socialist cities have been built, such as Malic, Uzi Olihi, Volku, Danvina, Danbuf, and other places. The creative labor enthusiasm of the Albanian people has also spread to the most remote mountainous areas of our country, and the sound of modern machines has broken the long-term tranquility in the Albanian mountains. Even in the places that were once desolate, the Party's banner, the banner of Marxism-Leninism, has been planted. The mineral deposits buried underground have been mined, and new workers' cities have been built, such as: the oil workers' city of Batoz, the chromium mine workers' city of Bulqize, the coal mine workers' city of Memaliaj, the iron ore workers' city of Pishkashi, the copper mine workers' city of Robik and Kurpinashi, etc. Huge dams and hydropower stations have been built and are being built in the steep valleys where the river water is turbulent. Today, tall high-voltage power transmission towers stand on the mountain slopes where there were no even telephone poles in the past. All these indicate the boiling new life in our country. The hydroelectric power stations that have been built include the "Karl Marx" hydroelectric power station on the Mat River, the "Lenin" hydroelectric power station on Mount Dajti, and the Xhikupe and Bistrica hydroelectric power stations that are under construction.

    On this happy festival, the Albanian people express their deep gratitude to the Labor Party, which has consistently and victoriously led the Albanian people from victory to victory in the past and present. The strength of our Party lies in its loyalty to Marxist-Leninist doctrines and the principles of proletarian internationalism. Our Party has consistently and resolutely defended the purity of Marxism-Leninism in the past and present, and will continue to struggle against any attacks on Marxism-Leninism, especially against modern revisionism.

    An important and decisive factor in the Albanian people's achievements is the consistent fraternal assistance provided by the Soviet Union since the liberation of the Albanian people. Without the comprehensive assistance of the world's first socialist country, Albania would not have been able to move forward, the fruits of the people's revolution would not have been guaranteed, and Albania would not have been able to develop as a free and independent socialist country.

    Today, every new thing, it can be said that almost every new thing that has appeared and is being built in our country is inseparable from this assistance, as well as from the friendship that links our people and the Soviet people together. The assistance given to the Albanian people by the great Chinese people and the fraternal people of other socialist countries, as well as the comprehensive and close cooperation between them, is huge and important. The achievements Albania has made are the result of the socialist cooperation between the countries of our socialist camp. From the further consolidation and expansion of the fraternal cooperation and all other relations that exist today between the people of socialist countries, and which are based on the immortal principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, as well as from the further strengthening of our socialist camp, the Albanian people see not only their happy future, but also the happy future of all other fraternal people, and they also see the guarantee of defending world peace.

    On this happy festival, the Albanian people express their deep gratitude to the fraternal socialist people for the fraternal assistance they have given to the Albanian people in building a new and happy life.

    Comrades! Please allow me, on behalf of the Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, to express my deep gratitude to the fraternal Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China for the assistance they have given to the Albanian people in the socialist construction of Albania in the past and present.

    Dear comrades and friends!

    It has been less than two months since the historically significant festival, the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, just passed. We have personally witnessed the Chinese people solemnly celebrating their festival. In these short ten years, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, have achieved great victories in economic and cultural construction that have never been seen in thousands of years of history. The establishment of the people's communes last year was a great victory in the socialist transformation of the countryside. The international prestige of the People's Republic of China is increasing day by day, its influence is expanding, and its role in the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world is becoming increasingly important. The participation of the People's Republic of China in resolving the unresolved international issues that are currently of concern to all mankind is becoming increasingly urgent. The attempts by imperialism, especially US imperialism, to refuse to allow the People's Republic of China to participate in resolving the above international affairs, to try to obstruct the restoration of the People's Republic of China's position in the United Nations, to create the conspiracy of so-called "two Chinas" and to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, are doomed to shameful failure. The Government of the People's Republic of Albania fully agrees with the policies adopted by the Government of the People's Republic of China to resolve the above urgent issues, and unreservedly supports these policies.

    The Albanian people also solemnly celebrated the 10th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. The Albanian people have consistently paid attention to the creative labor of the talented fraternal Chinese people. We are incredibly excited about the historically significant victories you have achieved in such a short period of time, and we regard your victories and achievements as our own, as the victories and achievements of the entire socialist camp. The Albanian people are happy for the achievements and victories of the Chinese people, and it encourages the Albanian people to better complete their tasks. Our people are very happy to see that in the past two years, the Chinese people, under the leadership of their Communist Party, have worked hard according to the slogan of more, faster, better, and more economical, and have victoriously realized the great leap forward in all aspects of life. We are incredibly excited that your great people, under the brilliant light of the general line of your Party, will firmly complete the main targets of your second five-year plan this year, that is, three years ahead of schedule. We are happy for the bright future facing your great talented people. There is no doubt that the achievements in the future will be even greater, and the prestige of the People's Republic of China as a great and powerful socialist country will increase day by day.

    Dear comrades, our two peoples are brothers in a big family. The Chinese people are the elder brother in this family, and the Albanian people are the youngest brother. Geographically, we are separated by tens of thousands of miles. You are at the eastern end of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, while we are at the westernmost end. But no matter how far this geographical distance is, our hearts are beating together, our thoughts are the same, we have common wishes and goals, and common ideals unite us. We are advancing towards a common goal - socialism and communism. Although the friendship between us is relatively young, it is as hot as fire and as strong as steel. Like every new thing, it is developing and consolidating with huge strides, and no force can stop its development. The creators of this friendship - the Marxist-Leninist parties of our two countries - are its guarantee. In fact, the relationship between us is constantly strengthening and developing, and delegations from the Party, government, and other economic, cultural, and social organizations of our two countries are frequently visiting each other. There is no doubt that this kind of exchange will become more frequent in the future. The Albanian people have a deep friendship and love for the great fraternal Chinese people, the Albanian people have a deep respect for the Chinese people, the Chinese Party, and the Chinese government, and strive to learn more about the creative labor of the Chinese people. Please allow me to assure you that the Chinese people will always have such a small but sincere friend, a comrade-in-arms who is loyal to our common cause. We will hold high the banner of socialist victory, and let this banner forever fly on the Adriatic coast.

    Comrades, the Albanian people are celebrating the 15th anniversary of their liberation under the condition that the international tension is easing due to the firm peace policy implemented by the Soviet Union and the socialist countries, and the ice of the "cold war" is melting and will surely melt under the warm and bright light of peace, and a new desire to defend and strengthen peace has emerged. The belief in the peaceful coexistence of the two social systems is also deepening in the capitalist world. Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States and his talks with US President Eisenhower, and his comprehensive disarmament proposal made on behalf of the Soviet government at the United Nations General Assembly, have made huge and decisive contributions to easing tensions.

    The Albanian people, the Albanian Party, and the Albanian government express their sincere welcome to this new initiative of the Soviet Union that is conducive to defending and strengthening peace, and will continue to maintain vigilance against all reactionary forces that are active under the banner of "policy of strength" and "cold war," and will continue to work hard until the war crisis is eliminated and world peace is completely victorious.

    Today, the cause of peace is precious to people of all walks of life around the world. They are using all their strength to turn the recent easing of international tensions into a consolidated and lasting peace among the people of all countries. Under such circumstances, President Tito's attacks and slanders against the Albanian people and leaders in the speeches made by him and other Yugoslav leaders on November 22, 1959, are ulterior motives and do not help to defend world peace and the friendship between the people of all countries.

    Comrades, the Albanian people will enter the sixteenth year after liberation with unprecedented unity around the Party and the government, and with great victories and full of confidence in a better and brighter prospect. Our people estimate the difficulties they will encounter in the tasks to be completed in order to strive to reach the level of other socialist fraternal countries. But they are convinced that under the leadership of the Party and the Party Central Committee headed by Hoxha, and in the friendly and close cooperation with the people of the countries of the socialist camp, the day when our country, as our Albanian people's dear friend N.S. Khrushchev said, will become a prosperous big garden among socialist countries is not far away.

    Long live the 15th anniversary of Albania's liberation!

    Long live and prosper the unbreakable friendship and close cooperation between the Albanian people and the Chinese people!

    Long live the Marxist-Leninist parties of our two countries that have been tested and which have forged our friendly relations!

    Long live the great fraternal Chinese people and their great leader, the outstanding Marxist, and the Albanian people's dear friend Comrade Mao Zedong!

    Long live the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the guarantee of world peace!

    Long live peace and friendship among the people of all countries in the world!

    阿尔巴尼亚人民在党的光辉旗帜下大踏步前进
    帕里夫蒂大使在首都各界庆祝大会上的讲话亲爱的主席同志，最尊敬的朱德同志，亲爱的李先念同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    请允许我代表阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和全体阿尔巴尼亚人民，向中华人民共和国对外文化联络委员会、中阿友好协会、中华全国总工会、中华全国民主青年联合会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会和中国文学艺术界联合会表示衷心的感谢，感谢它们为阿尔巴尼亚解放十五周年而举行的这个隆重的庆祝大会，同时也热烈地感谢出席这个庆祝大会的中华人民共和国光荣的首都北京人民的各界代表。
    十五年以前，1944年11月29日阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚共产党，即今天的劳动党的领导下，经历了五年艰苦的斗争，永远摆脱了帝国主义和国内封建——资产阶级的双重压迫和剥削。1944年11月29日，阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级、劳动农民以及和他们在一起的一切进步爱国力量，在党的领导下，胜利地完成了人民革命；他们驱逐了法西斯占领力量，推翻了旧的封建资产阶级政权并建立了新的人民的政权，人民自己的政权。
    阿尔巴尼亚的人民革命，是在一定历史条件下，即在苏联的存在、苏联参加第二次世界大战和苏联人民战胜法西斯力量的世界范围的历史性胜利的条件下完成的。如果苏联没有参加第二次世界大战，并且在这次战争中没有战胜反动势力，那么阿尔巴尼亚人民就不能获得解放，今天也就不会有阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国。
    阿尔巴尼亚的解放日，1944年11月29日，是阿尔巴尼亚人民历史上具有重大意义的日子，它标志着一个新的历史时期的开端，标志着我国人民新的幸福生活的开端。从那时起到现在十五年过去了，这在人民的历史上是一个很短的时期。但是在这一时期中，阿尔巴尼亚人民在自己的劳动党的领导下，以忘我的劳动以及在首先是苏联和其他社会主义国家兄弟般的援助下，进行了一系列经济、政治、社会和文化的巨大的历史的改革。为了更好地了解这一时期中获得了多么巨大的胜利，就需要首先了解一下战前的阿尔巴尼亚。战前的阿尔巴尼亚不论在经济上还是在政治上都是欧洲最落后的国家。它曾经是一个落后的农业国，几乎没有工业，工人阶级的力量很薄弱，而且很少，80％以上的人口是文盲。这是一个半殖民地的国家，银行和一切财政机构都掌握在外国资本家手里，丰富的地下资源：石油、铁、铬、沥青等以及最肥沃的土地都曾是外国帝国主义托辣斯所租借的。纳粹法西斯的侵略以及五年来的战争，更加破坏了阿尔巴尼亚虚弱的经济，更加恶化了阿尔巴尼亚人民的经济状况。在五年反法西斯战争中，无论在人力或物力方面，阿尔巴尼亚人民都付出了巨大的代价。例如，伤亡和失踪的人数达全国人口总数的6.4％，即七万人，21％的农村住宅被烧毁，损失了三分之一的牲畜，全部原有的工厂、矿山都陷于瘫痪状态，公路、桥梁、港口和其他交通工具都遭到破坏，储存在阿尔巴尼亚国家银行中的人民的财产也被法西斯抢劫一空。
    人民政权所继承的是一个生产力很低、极端落后和虚弱的经济，战争给我们留下了严重的创伤。但是人民政权，从它一建立起就执行了以马克思列宁主义学说为根据的党的各项指示，采取了一系列很重要的经济的和社会的措施，以便彻底破坏旧的生产关系，为在最短期间内恢复遭受破坏的经济，并为国民经济和文化的计划发展打下基础，人民政权立即收回外国的租借权；把矿山、银行、主要交通运输都收归国有，对对外贸易实行了国家垄断。我们还进行了土地改革，永远摧毁了农业生产中的半封建生产关系，同时进行了教育改革，使教育和文化为人民服务。此外还采取了其他一系列有利于广大人民群众的措施。阿尔巴尼亚人民立即响应了党的恢复和建设国家的号召。在以霍查为首的党中央委员会的领导下，阿尔巴尼亚人民满怀热情地，以新的加倍的力量，坚决投入了创造性的建设工作。阿尔巴尼亚变成了一个巨大的建设工地。阿尔巴尼亚人民以史无前例的速度，克服着由于过去长时期来的落后以及缺乏经验和各种物资材料而造成的严重的困难，和那些公开或秘密进行活动的帝国主义及其仆从，特别是和干涉我国内政的南斯拉夫领导进行斗争。在党“一手拿着镐，一手拿着武器”的口号下，恢复了被破坏的公路、桥梁、工厂和矿山，并在废墟上建起了新的住宅和学校。新的工厂、矿山、第一条铁路和第一批水力发电站一个接一个地建立起来了。新的生活在阿尔巴尼亚农村中也开始了，成立了第一批合作社。第一批拖拉机和其他农业机器也在阿尔巴尼亚的田野里出现了。与此同时，教育、艺术和文化也获得了空前的发展。进行了轰轰烈烈的扫盲运动，各企业、各建筑工地、各农村和机关到处都成立了扫盲学习班。小学和中学网成倍地扩大，成立了第一批技术学校和高等学校。解放后第一次建立了职业剧院、开办了剧院、歌剧和芭蕾舞剧院、轻歌剧院、国家乐团、国家歌舞团和其他无数的文化团体。同时还建立了电影制片厂，并第一次在国内拍制了影片。
    这样，经过了一段紧张忘我的劳动以后，阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党的领导下，在各社会主义国家兄弟般的援助下，为经济和文化有计划的发展创造了条件，顺利地走上了社会主义建设的道路。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，在社会主义建设中遵循马克思列宁主义学说，采用了苏联建设社会主义的宝贵经验和其他兄弟党的经验，同时也根据我国的客观条件，制订了三年计划（1948年—1950年），以及其后的发展国民经济和文化的第一个五年计划（1951年—1955年）。由于上述计划的胜利完成，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的生产力显著地提高了。阿尔巴尼亚人民现在正在为完成和超额完成1956年6月阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第三次代表大会通过的第二个五年计划第四年的任务而努力。第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划头两年计划的胜利完成，为大大修改扩大第二个五年计划的指标提供了可能。在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会1958年2月举行的全体会议作了这些补充，它预见1960年工农业总产量将比1955年增加将近一倍。
    亲爱的同志们、朋友们！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民每年都愉快地以新的成就来迎接自己的国庆，但是今年是在同过去不同的条件下庆祝自己解放的十五周年。在很久以前我国就展开了轰轰烈烈的社会主义竞赛，大批的工人集体不断地向党和政府报告他们完成和超额完成生产计划的消息，有不少工人现在已经完成了今年的任务，并开始了1960年的工作任务。今年，我国劳动人民的物质文化生活水平不断提高，对美好的未来和伟大光明的远景充满信心。像过去一样坚定地沿着亲爱的党所指出的社会主义建设大道，以更快的速度前进，他们用空前的成就和胜利来庆祝自己的国庆节。
    亲爱的同志们，请允许我叙述一下阿尔巴尼亚人民在十五年来获得的一些成就。
    在这段时期里，工业有了巨大的发展。我们党一贯关怀国家的社会主义工业化。这是很自然的而且也是必要的。你们知道，战前，阿尔巴尼亚的工业总产量仅占全国工农业产量的9.8％。然而，1958年底，阿尔巴尼亚的工业产值就比战前（1938年）增加了十七点八倍。到1959年底将增加到二十二倍。这个任务在今年前三个季度业已完成，即这个时期的计划完成了103.9％，为去年同时期的125.1％。在过去的十五年内，原有的工业部门得到了扩建和现代化的设备，同时还建立了很多新的部门，丰富的地下矿藏的开采也有了巨大的发展。在最近的十年中，拥有现代化设备的社会主义工业每年平均增长19％。我国工业发展的特点是以国内现有原料为基础。由于我国工业生产如此迅速的增长，战前一年才能生产的工业品现在只需要十六天就生产出来。为了更好地了解阿尔巴尼亚工业生产的增长，不妨列举下面的例子：按人口平均计算，1938年的工业产值为一千三百三十里克，而1959年则增加到一万九千七百六十三里克。
    我国工业各部门都迅速地发展着，例如，与战前（1938年）相比，1959年电力工业生产增加了十八倍，石油工业生产增加了十七点二五倍，煤炭工业生产增加了七十六点六五倍，铬矿开采量增加了三十五点五倍，机械工业生产增加了十六点六倍，木材工业生产增加了五十二倍，轻工业生产增加了二十一点四倍，纺织工业生产增加六十一倍，食品工业生产增加了十五点五倍。
    在工业方面已经获得的成就基础上，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国有可能在短短的时期内，缩短了它同其他国家，特别是同邻国在工业方面所存在的巨大距离。在若干产品方面，按人口计算的产量都已赶上或超过了邻国。例如，在铬的产量方面，阿尔巴尼亚已占世界第六位，如按人口计算，则已占世界第一位；阿尔巴尼亚在石油产量方面，按人口计算已超过了意大利、土耳其、南斯拉夫和埃及等国。阿尔巴尼亚在煤和铁的产量方面，按人口计算也超过了意大利、希腊和土耳其。在1957年阿尔巴尼亚电力和水泥的产量，如按人口计算则比土耳其1956年的产量还要各多30％和20％。现在在阿尔巴尼亚按人口计算，每年每人可得棉布十五米，在这方面也超过了土耳其、意大利和希腊。
    阿尔巴尼亚工业的发展速度，是任何资本主义国家所从来没有过的。十五年来，在工业方面所获得的成就再一次证明了社会主义制度的生命力和优越性。如果阿尔巴尼亚沿着过去封建资产阶级制度的道路发展的话，那么要达到1960年的工业生产水平，至少也需要一百四十年，而1958年一年的投资额，就相当于过去七十年的投资总额。
    以上成就也是阿尔巴尼亚对两个制度之间的和平竞赛作出的小小贡献。
    在这一时期里，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国在农业方面以及农业的社会主义改造中也获得了重大的成就。党和人民政府注意到我国农业的过去落后状况，一贯非常重视农业的发展。由于党和政府不断采取了各种措施，到1960年，耕地面积将为1938年的204.5％，今年的农业产量和1938年相比已增加173％。最近十年来，农业总产量平均每年增加8.8％。农业机械化受到了极大的重视，今天我国的农业已有三千八百三十七台拖拉机
  （以十五匹马力计算），即每一千公顷土地上平均有四点五台拖拉机，拥有二百一十六台康拜因和许多其他的农业机器。我们还不断地采用先进的农业技术，为了消除农业的水旱灾害，开凿了一系列的灌溉沟渠，进行了土壤改良工作。在过去的渺无人烟的沼泽地上建立了农场。我们种植了过去从未种过的农作物。经济作物、园艺、柑橘和葡萄有了极大的发展。
    我国农业中最大的成就是即将完成的农业社会主义改造。今天占着81.5％的耕地的69.6％以上的农户加入了农业合作社。在农业中社会主义成份占耕地的89.5％，它在农业中占统治地位，大部分的农产品都由它来提供。
    在这一时期中，阿尔巴尼亚人民在教育和文化艺术方面也获得了辉煌的成就。文盲已扫除。现在每个农村都有自己的学校，小学教育以及在若干城市中七年制教育已实现义务制。1959—1960学年的在校学生达二十三万一千五百名，即等于战前学生的四点四五倍。1957年，在原有高等学校的基础上，阿尔巴尼亚的历史上第一次建立了国立地拉那大学。今年在国立地拉那大学和其他高等学校中学习的大学生达二千九百四十八人，此外还有成百名大学生在苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家的高等学校里学习。有很多人在不脱离工作的情况下参加了函授学校的学习。现在我们共和国每五个人中就有一个人在学习。我国戏剧团体上演了不朽的古典音乐和古典戏剧作品，例如：“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”、“伊凡·苏萨宁”、“茶花女”和“白毛女”等，我国剧院现在还在上演莎士比亚、契呵夫、高尔基及其他作家的作品，去年还演出我国第一部歌剧“姆里卡”。今年还开设了高等戏剧学院，在这以前建立了艺术中学和歌剧芭蕾舞剧院的附属舞蹈学校。此外我们还开始自己拍制艺术影片。
    在经济、文化的其他部门和保健事业方面也获得了同样的成就。由于取得了这些成就，我国国民收入增加了，我国人民的物质和文化水平与战前时期相比是无可比拟地提高了。现在，阿尔巴尼亚人民的衣食住方面都得到了更好的改善，今天的文化生活也是过去的人民所梦想不到的。在这一时期内阿尔巴尼亚人口增加了四十万，即每一千人中每年平均增加三十人。这是我国人民的幸福生活的鲜明例证。
    在经济文化建设的同时，我国的独立也日益巩固了，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国在国际舞台上的威望也提高了。阿尔巴尼亚作为帝国主义各国间进行买卖的商品的时代已经一去不复返了。阿尔巴尼亚今天已是一个自由独立的社会主义国家。它是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和华沙条约的积极的成员。它已和二十三个国家建立了外交关系。它是联合国以及其他国际组织的会员国。由于阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国一贯奉行保卫和巩固和平的政策，以及和平共处和睦邻政策，它是保卫巴尔干和欧洲和平的一个重要因素。
    由于到现在为止获得的这些成就，阿尔巴尼亚已从一个落后的农业国变成了农业—工业国，现在正沿着将我国建成一个工业—农业国的道路迅速迈进。这一点在党和政府所制订的第三个五年计划中就已作了规定。
    同志们，阿尔巴尼亚人民之所以能获得这些成就，是由于自己的忘我劳动和高度的爱国主义精神。这些成就也是在与各种困难和阻碍的斗争中，以及同妄想干涉我国内政、推翻人民政权和建立为人民所痛恨的封建—资产阶级政权的帝国主义者及其走狗的斗争中取得的。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民所取得的这些成就应该归功于阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导。我们党遵循着马克思列宁主义学说和无产阶级国际主义原则，同时也吸取了苏联母亲党和其他兄弟党的普遍经验，才发动和领导了阿尔巴尼亚人民取得了人民革命的胜利和顺利地进行社会主义建设。
    在过去的十五年内，阿尔巴尼亚人民在党的光荣旗帜下大踏步地前进，他经历了一条艰难而光荣的道路，他彻底地改变了亲爱的祖国的面貌。从前在阿尔巴尼亚国土上的沼泽地，现在已变成了一片绿色的肥田，建起了新的工厂和美丽的社会主义城市，例如，玛利奇、乌兹奥利希、伏尔古、旦尔维纳、旦尔布夫等地。阿尔巴尼亚人民创造性的劳动热情也传遍了我国最偏僻的山区，现代化机器的响声冲破了阿尔巴尼亚群山中长期的宁静。就是在从前荒无人烟的地方，也插上了党的旗帜，马克思列宁主义的旗帜。埋藏在地下的矿藏被开采了出来，工人的新城市建立了起来，像这样的城市有：石油工人城巴托斯，铬矿工人城布尔基兹，煤矿工人城梅马丽亚，铁矿工人城皮希加希，铜矿工人城罗比克和库尔皮纳希等。在河水汹涌的陡峭山谷里建成了和正在建筑着巨大的水坝和水力发电站，在过去连电线杆也没有的山坡上，今天矗立着高大的高压电线塔。这些都说明了我国沸腾的新生活。已建成的水电站有马特河上的“卡尔·马克思”水电站，达伊蒂山上的“列宁”水电站，正在修建中的有希库比和皮斯脱里察水电站。
    在这愉快的节日里，阿尔巴尼亚人民对过去和现在一贯坚强和胜利地领导着阿尔巴尼亚人民从胜利走向胜利的劳动党怀着深切的感激。我们党的力量在于它忠于马克思列宁主义的学说和无产阶级国际主义原则。我们的党过去和现在一直坚决保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，今后也仍将与对马克思列宁主义的任何攻击，特别是与现代修正主义进行斗争。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民获得这些成就的一个重要的决定性因素是：苏联从阿尔巴尼亚人民一解放起就给予一贯的兄弟般的援助。如果没有世界上第一个社会主义国家的全面援助，阿尔巴尼亚就不可能前进，人民革命胜利的果实也就无法得到保障，阿尔巴尼亚也不可能作为一个自由和独立的社会主义国家而得到发展。
    今天，每一件新事物，可以说几乎在我们国内出现的和正在建设中出现的每一个新事物都是同这一援助，以及同我国人民和苏联人民连系在一起的友谊分不开的。伟大的中国人民和其他社会主义国家兄弟人民给予阿尔巴尼亚人民的援助，以及他们之间的全面密切的合作，是巨大的和重要的。阿尔巴尼亚获得的成就是我们社会主义阵营国家间的社会主义合作的结果。从今天存在在社会主义各国人民之间的，并以不朽的马克思列宁主义原则和无产阶级国际主义为基础建立起来的兄弟般的合作和其他一切关系的进一步巩固和扩大中，以及从我们社会主义阵营进一步加强中，阿尔巴尼亚人民不仅看到了他们的幸福的未来，而且也看到了所有其他兄弟人民的幸福未来，他们还看到了保卫世界和平的保证。
    在这一愉快的节日里，阿尔巴尼亚人民向社会主义各兄弟人民表示深切的感谢，感谢他们在建设新的幸福生活中给予阿尔巴尼亚人民的兄弟般的援助。
    同志们！请允许我代表阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府，在这里向兄弟的中国人民、中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府表示深切的感谢，感谢他们在过去和现在在阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义建设中给予阿尔巴尼亚人民的援助。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    具有历史意义的节日，中华人民共和国建国十周年刚刚过去还不到两个月。我们亲眼看到中国人民隆重地庆祝了自己的节日。在这短短的十年中，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在经济和文化建设方面取得了伟大的、几千年历史上从未有过的胜利。去年人民公社的建立是农村社会主义改造的一个巨大胜利。中华人民共和国在国际上的威望日益提高，它的影响也日益扩大，它在保卫亚洲和世界和平事业中所起的作用也越来越大。中华人民共和国参加解决目前为全人类所关心的未决的国际问题是愈益变得急迫需要了。帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义拒绝让中华人民共和国参加解决上述国际事务的企图，竭力阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的地位，制造所谓“两个中国”的阴谋和霸占中国领土台湾，都注定要遭到可耻的失败。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府完全同意中华人民共和国政府对解决以上迫切问题所采取的政策，并毫无保留地支持这一政策。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民也隆重地庆祝了中华人民共和国的十周年。阿尔巴尼亚人民一贯注视着天才的兄弟中国人民的创造性劳动。为你们在这样短的时期内所获得的这种具有历史意义的胜利感到无比的兴奋，我们把你们的胜利和成就看作是自己的，是全社会主义阵营的胜利和成就。阿尔巴尼亚人民为中国人民获得的成就和胜利而欢欣，它鼓舞阿尔巴尼亚人民更好地去完成自己的任务。我国人民十分高兴地看到，在最近两年内，中国人民在自己共产党的领导下，根据多、快、好、省的口号努力工作，并在生活的各个方面胜利地实现了大跃进。我们感到无比兴奋的是：你们伟大的人民在你们党的总路线的光辉照耀下，坚定地将在今年，也就是说提前三年完成你们第二个五年计划的主要指标。我们为你们伟大天才的人民所面临的光辉前途而感到高兴。毫无疑问，今后的成就将会更大，中华人民共和国作为一个伟大和强大的社会主义国家的威信将日益提高。
    亲爱的同志们，我们两国人民是一个大家庭里的兄弟，中国人民是这个大家庭里的大哥，而阿尔巴尼亚人民是最小的兄弟。地理上我们之间相隔万里，你们是在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的东端，而我们却在最西端。但是不管这地理上的距离多远，我们的心是在一起跳动，我们的思想是一致的，我们有共同的愿望和目标，共同的理想把我们团结在一起，我们向着共同的目标——社会主义和共产主义前进。我们之间的友谊虽然比较年轻，但它却似火一般的热，钢一般的坚，它像每一件新生的事物一样正在以巨大的步伐巩固地发展着，没有任何力量能阻挡它的发展。这一友谊的缔造者——我们两国马克思列宁主义政党是它的保证。事实上，我们之间的关系正日益不断地增强和发展，我们两国之间党、政府和其它经济、文化和社会团体的代表团经常往来不断。毫无疑问今后这种往来将会更加频繁。阿尔巴尼亚人民对伟大的兄弟——中国人民怀着深厚的友谊和热爱，阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民、中国党和政府怀着深切的敬意，并且努力要更多地学习中国人民创造性的劳动。请允许我向你们保证，中国人民将永远有这样一个小的但是真诚的朋友，一个忠于我们共同事业的战友。我们将高举社会主义胜利的旗帜，并让这一旗帜永远飘扬在亚得里亚海边。
    同志们，阿尔巴尼亚人民是在苏联和各社会主义国家执行坚定不移的和平政策，使国际紧张局势日趋缓和，“冷战”的冰块正在也必将在温暖而光亮的和平之光照耀下融化，出现了保卫和加强和平的新的愿望的情况下，庆祝自己的解放十五周年。两个社会制度和平共处的信念在资本主义世界里也日益深入人心了。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志的访美之行以及他和美国总统艾森豪威尔的谈判和他代表苏联政府在联合国大会上所作的全面的裁军倡议，都对缓和紧张局势作出了巨大的、决定性的贡献。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚党和政府对苏联这一有利于保卫和加强和平的新倡议表示衷心的欢迎，同时将继续保持警惕以反对那些以“实力政策”和“冷战”为后盾，进行活动的一切反动势力，并将继续努力，直到战争危机消除，世界和平完全胜利。
    今天，和平事业对全世界各阶层的人来说都是宝贵的。他们以自己的全部力量，使最近出现的国际紧张局势的缓和成为各国人民间的巩固的持久和平。在这种情况下，铁托总统于1959年11月22日和南斯拉夫其他领导人所发表的演说中对阿尔巴尼亚人民及领导人的攻击和诬蔑都是别有用心的，丝毫无助于保卫世界和平和各国人民之间的友谊。
    同志们，阿尔巴尼亚人民将空前的团结在党和政府的周围，并以巨大的胜利满怀更美好、更光辉的远景的信心，进入解放后的第十六个年头。我国人民估计到为争取达到其他社会主义兄弟国家的水平应完成的任务中将要遇到的困难。但是他们深信，在党和以霍查为首的党中央的领导下，在同社会主义阵营各国人民的友好和紧密的合作下，我国正像阿尔巴尼亚人民的亲爱的朋友尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫所说的那样，变成社会主义国家中的一个繁盛的大花园的日子已经不远了。
    阿尔巴尼亚解放十五周年万岁！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊和紧密的合作万岁和昌盛！
    缔结我们两国友好关系的我们两国久经考验的马克思列宁主义的党万岁！
    伟大的兄弟中国人民及其伟大的领袖、杰出的马克思主义者、阿尔巴尼亚人民亲爱的朋友毛泽东同志万岁！
    世界和平的保障——以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界各国人民之间的和平友谊万岁！
