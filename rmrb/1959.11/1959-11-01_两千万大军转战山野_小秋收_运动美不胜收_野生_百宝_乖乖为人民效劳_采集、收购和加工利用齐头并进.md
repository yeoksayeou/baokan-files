Xinhua News Agency, 31st: The "Small Autumn Harvest" movement has formed a climax in most parts of the country. The movement is surging and magnificent in scale, unprecedented. According to incomplete statistics, about 20 million people across the country have been involved in this movement.

    Having deeply implemented the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and on the basis of opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, various regions have publicized the significance of collecting and utilizing wild plants, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of the broad masses to enter the mountains to collect treasures. Guizhou Province has a "treasure collecting" army of 3.4 million people working hard in the mountainous areas. From October 1st to 19th, Qian Dongnan, Qiannan, Zunyi, Anshun, and other regions have collected more than 420,000 dan of acorns, 100,000 dan of wild fibers, and more than 17,000 dan of gallnuts. In Henan Province, 55 counties have launched the "Small Autumn Harvest" movement, with 840,000 people going up the mountains in Xinyang Prefecture alone. In Neixiang County, eight communes dispatched 120,000 people to form professional teams and groups to collect treasures in the mountains. The total value of wild oil plants, vitex, and various wooden handles collected on October 20th and 21st reached 1.95 million yuan. According to statistics, by October 20th, Sichuan Province had 3 million people in the mountains. In Zhongxian County, more than 300,000 people launched a two-day and night blitz, collecting and purchasing 1.7 times more wild plant raw materials than the total collected last year.

    In the "Small Autumn Harvest" movement, various regions have implemented the principle of combining short-term blitzes with regular production by professional teams, and simultaneously promoting collective and individual management. At present, it is the peak season for wild plants to mature, and organizing the masses for blitz collection is the main form. In areas where there is a gap in agricultural production, the Party committee secretary takes command and organizes the masses into combat groups to launch blitzes in the mountains. In areas where autumn harvesting is busy, battle lines are divided to advance on two fronts, ensuring both the autumn harvest and the "Small Autumn Harvest," achieving a double harvest of both domestic and wild products. During the busy autumn harvest season in Jilin Province, while ensuring the autumn harvest and autumn grain procurement, a total of 350,000 people were drawn from across the province to establish more than 10,000 professional teams to engage in "Small Autumn Harvest" and sideline production. Liangtun Commune in Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, implemented a two-pronged approach of harvesting crops in the fields and collecting wild fruits, seizing the wild fruit ripening season to organize seven wild fruit collection teams to collect wild fruits. Various regions have also paid attention to widely mobilizing students, women, and the elderly and infirm, and have encouraged commune members to use their spare time to collect large quantities of products as a supplementary form of large-scale blitzes.

    With the development of the "Small Autumn Harvest" movement, the procurement work of commercial departments in various regions has become increasingly active, initially forming a high tide of large-scale collection and purchase. Some regions have already completed their annual procurement plans. In the first half of October, Shanxi Province purchased half as much wild starch raw material as it had in January to September, 70% as much wild oil, and more wild tannin raw material than it had in January to September. By October 20th, Jilin Province had purchased more than 76,000 dan of wild oil, exceeding the second-half-year procurement plan by 3%. In Fujian, the amount of wild fiber purchased in ten days in October was equivalent to 95.4% of the amount purchased in August and September. In Yulin Prefecture, Guangxi, the amount of wild plant raw materials purchased on October 13th and 14th alone increased fourfold compared with the daily purchase volume in the first ten days of the month.

    While vigorously collecting and purchasing, various regions have also attached importance to processing and utilization. Baojing County in Hunan Province has successfully trial-produced gunny sacks using wild fiber, and has already produced 2,000 sacks, with a quality comparable to jute sacks. The Commercial Department of Guizhou Province has allocated one million yuan to various regions to add and repair processing equipment, requiring various regions to seize the opportunity to process pulp, liquor, and oils from wild plant raw materials. Seven counties in Liaoning Province, including Qingyuan, Kaiyuan, and Kuandian, have helped communes establish and restore 88 small-scale processing plants. Jian'ou County in Fujian Province immediately processed the 1,200 dan of wild fiber purchased in a blitz into 420 dan of refined fiber.

    两千万大军转战山野　“小秋收”运动美不胜收
    野生“百宝”乖乖为人民效劳
    采集、收购和加工利用齐头并进
    新华社31日讯  “小秋收”运动已在全国大部分地区形成高潮。运动来势汹涌，规模壮阔，为以前所未有。据不完全统计，目前全国投入这一运动的已有两千万人左右。
    各地在深入贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，反右倾、鼓干劲的基础上，宣传采集和利用野生植物的意义，大大激发了广大群众入山取宝的积极性。贵州省有三百四十万“采宝”大军正在山区大干特干，黔东南、黔南、遵义、安顺等地区从10月1日到19日已采集橡子四十二万多担，野生纤维十万担，五棓子一万七千多担。河南省有五十五个县展开了“小秋收”运动，仅信阳专区就有八十四万人上山。内乡县八个公社抽调十二万人组成专业队、组，上山采宝，10月20日和21日两天采集的野生油料、荆条和各种木把等，总值即达一百九十五万元。四川省到10月20日统计已有三百万人上山，忠县三十多万人突击两昼夜，就采集和收购了比去年全年还多一点七倍的野生植物原料。
    在“小秋收”运动中，各地贯彻了短期突击与专业队经常生产相结合，集体经营和个人经营同时并举的方针。目前正是野生植物成熟旺季，组织群众突击采集是主要形式。在农业生产有空隙的地方，就由党委书记挂帅，组织群众编成战斗小组上山突击；秋收工作繁忙的地区，便划分战线，两路进军，既保证秋收，又兼顾“小秋收”，作到家生野生双丰收。吉林省在秋收大忙时期，在保证秋收、秋征的前提下，全省共抽出三十五万人，建立一万多个专业队，从事“小秋收”和副业生产。辽宁省盖平县梁屯公社实行割大田、采野果两路进军，抓住野果成熟季节，组织七个野果采集队，采集野果。各地还注意广泛发动学生、妇女和老弱等半劳力，并且发动社员利用工余时间大量采集，作为大兵团突击的辅助形式。
    随着“小秋收”运动的发展，各地商业部门的收购工作也越来越活跃，初步形成了大收大购高潮。有的地区已经完成全年收购计划。山西省10月上半月收购的野生淀粉原料等于1月至9月收购额的一半，野生油料等于70％，野生栲胶原料超过了1月至9月的收购量。吉林省到10月20日止已收购野生油料七万六千多担，超额3％完成了下半年收购计划。福建10月份十天收购的野生纤维就相当于8、9两个月收购量的95.4％。广西玉林专区仅10月13、14两天收购的野生植物原料就比上旬日收量增加四倍。
    在大力采集、收购的同时，各地也重视了加工和利用。湖南保靖县用野生纤维试制麻袋成功，已生产两千条，质量与黄麻麻袋不相上下。贵州省商业厅已拨出一百万元资金给各地增添和维修加工设备，要求各地利用野生植物原料抓紧加工纸浆、酒类和油脂。辽宁省清源、开原、宽甸等七个县已帮助公社建立和恢复小型加工厂八十八所。福建省建瓯县突击收购的一千二百担野生纤维，已立即加工成四百二十担精纤维。
