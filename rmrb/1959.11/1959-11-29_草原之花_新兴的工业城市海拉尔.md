    Grassland Flower
    —The Emerging Industrial City of Hailar
    By our correspondents Bai Hao, Guo Pingyong

    In the northeast of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Greater Khingan Mountains stretch out their two arms for over a thousand miles, embracing a vast grassland. The city of Hailar, with a population of over 100,000, including Mongolian, Han, Daur, Ewenki, Hui, and Manchu people, stands in the center of this great grassland. The city now has more than a hundred factories. Chimneys emitting wisps of green smoke and newly built factory buildings make the city look like a bright flower blooming in the midst of the green grassland. Herdsmen proudly call it the "Grassland Flower."

    Every morning, on the highway leading from Hailar to the nearby pastoral areas, there is a constant flow of vehicles transporting milk produced by the people's communes and state-owned ranches from all parts of the grassland to the Hailar Dairy Factory, one of the largest mechanized dairy factories in our country. After autumn, it is the season when cattle and sheep on the grassland are full of fat and meat. At this time, in this city, you can see sturdy male and female herders riding tall horses, driving herds of cattle and sheep from all over the grassland into the Hailar Meat Processing Plant. This factory can slaughter and process eighty to one hundred cattle, or three hundred to five hundred sheep per hour.

    After the cattle and sheep enter the meat processing plant, the large amount of hides stripped from them after the meat is removed are sent to its neighbor—a large-scale mechanized leather factory, where they are processed into heavy leather, light leather, harness leather, and various types of fragrant cattle leather and Mongolian boots unique to the grassland....

    The industrial construction of this grassland city is like a herd of horses galloping on the grassland, raising their heads to chase the wind, advancing rapidly. At the beginning of liberation, there was only a dilapidated power plant and a few simple handicraft workshops. During the first Five-Year Plan period, more than forty light and heavy industrial factories emerged. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the number of factories surged to more than one hundred. Not only does it produce a rich variety of meat, leather, and dairy products, but also steel, coke, cement, small generators, machine tools, bearings, cargo ships, tugboats, trailers, paper, and glass. In the last four years, more than 30,000 tons of beef, mutton, frozen fish, pharmaceuticals, and chemical raw materials have been shipped from Hailar to domestic and foreign markets; from 1949 to 1958, more than 5.3 million kilograms of lactose, casein, and dairy industrial products were shipped to domestic and foreign markets.

    In the auditorium of the dairy factory, we saw a poem of praise given to the factory by nearby herdsmen. It reads: First, we praise the dairy factory, it is good to sell milk, we don't worry about spending money, and we are happy to increase production; second, we praise the dairy factory, it is convenient to take the bus, we are not afraid of traveling far to visit relatives, and we are happy to reunite with relatives.

    This poem expresses the close relationship between the emerging industry of Hailar and the nearby herdsmen. In the past, although the grassland was a "land of milk," there were no dairy factories, and a large amount of milk was wasted. Herdsmen had to sell cattle and sheep to pay for daily necessities such as grain, rice, salt, and tea. After liberation, herdsmen urgently demanded that the state utilize milk resources, so the first dairy factory was born in Hailar in 1950. The emergence of the dairy factory opened up broad prospects for herdsmen to expand production. The income of herdsmen selling milk increased, and they did not have to sell cattle and sheep for daily expenses, so they had the strength to expand reproduction. The dairy factory also provided loans to herdsmen for high-quality breeding bulls that produced more and better milk, which were used to improve dairy cows, further stimulating the enthusiasm of herdsmen in operating animal husbandry. The Hailar Animal Husbandry Machinery Factory also provided support to animal husbandry. In the past year or so, it has supplied more than 400 horse-drawn mowers, rakes, and balers to nearby pastoral areas. Now this factory is also producing and successfully trial-producing automatic cattle drinkers, automatic milking machines, sheep shearing machines, feed choppers, snow breaking tools, and other animal husbandry machinery. These will gradually lead the livestock production on the grassland towards mechanization.

    In the past, grassland cattle and sheep could only be used for meat. Now, in the meat processing plant, there is no waste on cattle and sheep. After the meat and skin are removed, the remaining internal organs, heads, hooves, bones, and even blood and cattle ears can be made into dozens of medicines, chemical raw materials, and other products. Bile can be used to make pertussis, cholate, and bilirubin. Brain residue, blood, lungs, and liver residue can be used to make protein, an important raw material for antibiotics. In this way, the value of a cow (or sheep) is one to two times higher than when it could only be eaten for meat and skinned. In the past, leather that could only be used to make rough harnesses has now been transformed into soft face leather, backing leather, and ball leather through the meticulous processing of leather workers. They can also produce fragrant cattle leather, leather boots, jackets, and leather coats, with no less than hundreds of varieties. With the development of industry, the era when a bottle of white wine could be exchanged for a cow from a herdsman is gone forever. Now a cow can be exchanged for a beautiful and sturdy jacquard carpet, plus a pair of large leather boots. Hailar has fundamentally reversed the history of being unable to process finished leather goods in the past, having to transport raw hides out, and then importing industrial products from other places.

    草原之花
    ——新兴的工业城市海拉尔
    本报记者　白皓　郭平永
    在内蒙古自治区的东北部，大兴安岭伸出它绵延千余里的两只大手臂，环抱着一块大草原。拥有蒙古、汉、达斡尔、鄂温克、回、满等十余万人口的海拉尔市，就屹立在这大草原的中心。全市现在已有一百多座工厂。吐着缕缕青烟的烟囱、披着新装的厂房，使城市好像大草原上万绿丛中盛开的一朵鲜花。牧民们自豪地称它为“草原之花”。
    每天清晨，在海拉尔市通向附近牧区的公路上，就出现了络绎不绝的车辆，它们在把草原各地人民公社和国营牧场出产的牛奶，运往我国目前最大的机械化乳品工厂之一的海拉尔乳品厂。秋后，正是草原上牛羊膘满肉肥的季节。这时候，在这座城市里，你可以看到彪悍的男女牧民骑着高头大马，从草原各地赶着成群的牛羊，走进海拉尔肉类联合加工厂。这座工厂每一小时就可宰杀和处理八十到一百头牛，或三百到五百只羊。
    牛羊进了肉类联合加工厂，剔除肉类，扒下来的大量皮张就送进了它的近邻——大型的机械化皮革厂里去，被加工成重革、轻革、马具皮和草原上特有的各种香牛皮、蒙古靴……。
    这座草原城市的工业建设，简直如奔腾在草原上的群马一样，昂首追风，一日千里。解放当初，这里只有一座破旧的发电厂和几家简陋的手工作坊，第一个五年计划期间，轻重工业工厂出现了四十多座。经过1958年大跃进，工厂猛增到一百多座。不但生产丰富多彩的肉类、皮革、乳制品，而且生产钢铁、焦炭、水泥、小型发电机、机床、轴承、货船、拖轮、拖车、纸张、玻璃等。最近四年间，从海拉尔运往国内外的牛羊肉、冻鱼、医药和化工原料有三万多吨；从1949年到1958年，运往国内外的乳糖、酪胶和乳制工业品，有五百三十多万公斤。
    在乳品工厂的礼堂里，我们看到附近牧民送给工厂的一首赞词。写的是：一赞有了乳品厂，出售牛奶好处多，家中零用不愁钱，提高生产喜盈盈；二赞有了乳品厂，乘坐汽车方便多，赶路探亲不怕远，亲戚团聚喜洋洋。
    这首赞词道出了海拉尔市新兴的工业和附近牧民唇齿相依的关系。从前，草原虽是“牛奶之乡”，却没有乳品工厂，大量牛奶白白丢掉，而牧民们买粮米、盐、茶等生活用品，都得卖牛羊支付。解放后，牧民们迫切要求国家利用牛奶资源，于是第一座乳品厂，1950年在海拉尔诞生了。乳品厂的出现，给牧民扩大生产开辟了广阔的天地。牧民们卖牛奶的收入增加了，不用卖牛卖羊作日常开支，有力量扩大了再生产。乳品厂还贷款给牧民产奶又多又好的良种公牛，用来改良奶牛，进一步刺激了牧民经营畜牧业的积极性。海拉尔牧业机械厂也给畜牧业以支援。在最近一年多来，供给了附近牧区马拉打草机、搂草机、捆草机四百多台。现在这座工厂又生产和试制成功自动饮牛器、自动挤奶器、剪羊毛机、饲料切碎机、破雪工具等牧业机械。这些，将使草原上的畜牧业生产逐步走向机械化。
    从前，草原的牛羊只能当肉食用，现在，在肉类联合加工厂里，牛羊身上已没有废物了。去了肉皮，剩下的内脏、头、蹄、骨头，以至血液、牛耳，能制成数十种医药、化工原料和其他产品，利用胆可以制出百日咳、胆酸盐、胆红色素。用脑渣、血、肺、肝渣可以制出抗生素的重要原料——蛋白质。这样一来，一头牛（或羊）的价值比原来只能吃肉、扒皮时就提高了一至二倍。过去只能制造粗糙马具的皮张，现在经过皮革工人的精心泡制，变成了柔美的面皮、底片、球皮，而且能生产香牛皮、皮靴、夹克、皮大衣，品种不下数百种。随着工业的发展，那种一瓶白酒可以换走牧民一头牛的时代一去不复返了，现在一条牛可以换回一条美丽结实的提花毯，外加一双大皮靴。海拉尔已从根本上扭转了过去不能加工皮货成品，只好外运原皮，再由外地调进工业品的历史。（附图片）
