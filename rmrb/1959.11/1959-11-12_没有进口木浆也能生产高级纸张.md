    High-Grade Paper Can Be Produced Without Imported Wood Pulp
    The Shanghai Guofeng Paper Mill produces industrial and technical specialty paper, which requires high-quality raw materials, much of which must be imported wood pulp. The workers enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party committee to "both produce high-grade products and continuously increase output," and launched a difficult struggle against the shortage of raw materials. The workers not only proposed solutions but also immediately took action to find resources. The factory immediately formed a combat team and went to inquire in all directions, searching for ink ash bags at rubber factories, broken bags at cement factories, paper edges and waste paper at cable factories, chemical factories, construction sites, and..., to all factories and units that used high-grade paper to find resources. They also strived for the cooperation of waste product companies to select high-grade waste paper that could replace wood pulp from recycled waste paper. They traveled all over Shanghai and then to other places, sending telegrams and express letters. Wherever there were raw materials, they would not let them go if they knew about them. Many advanced examples emerged in the large-scale collection of raw materials. For example, Comrade Mi Changhua was reluctant to throw away even a piece of waste paper or a piece of straw rope, always packing them up and bringing them to the factory to be used as raw materials. The leadership proposed to fight for ten days and actively increase waste product recovery. The workers consciously sent waste materials from their homes to the factory and mobilized their neighbors to bring out waste paper to support the factory's production. Thanks to the active efforts of the workers, raw materials came in steadily. In the first nine months of this year, a total of 325 tons of high-grade waste paper that could replace wood pulp were recovered, enabling our factory to produce a large amount of high-grade paper without imported wood pulp.

    没有进口木浆也能生产高级纸张
    上海国丰造纸厂生产的工业、技术特种用纸，原料的质量要求高，很大部分要进口木浆。工人群众热烈响应党委提出的“既要生产高级产品，又要不断提高产量”的号召，与原材料不足的困难展开了一场艰苦的斗争。职工群众不仅提出了办法，而且立即行动设法找寻资源。工厂马上成立了一支战斗队伍，东西南北四面八方去打听，跑到橡胶厂去找寻墨灰袋，到水泥厂去找破袋子，到电缆厂去找纸边损纸，到化工厂，到建筑工地，到……，到所有使用高级纸张的工厂单位去找寻资源，还争取废品公司的配合，在回收废纸中，拣选可以代替木浆的高档损纸。跑遍了上海又往外地跑，拍电报，写快信，哪里有原料只要知道，决不放过。在大搞原料中出现了很多先进事例。如宓长华同志，对一张废纸一根草绳也是舍不得扔掉，总是包好带到厂里充作原料。领导上提出奋战十天，积极增加废品回收。职工群众都自觉地将家里的废料送到厂里来，并纷纷动员邻居将废纸拿出来，支援厂里的生产。由于职工群众的积极努力，原材料源源而来，在今年九个月中，共回收到可代木浆的高级损纸达三百二十五吨之多，使我厂在没有进口木浆的情况下，生产出大量的高级纸张。
