Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, November 25th. Over 30,000 Tibetan, Hui, and Han residents in the central four districts of Lhasa have earnestly elected the staff of the Residents' Committees. The re-election of all twenty-seven Residents' Committees in these four districts has been completed through democratic elections. Approximately 96% of the residents in the four districts participated in the elections.

The re-election work of the Lhasa Residents' Committees lasted for more than a month. Due to the gradual development of urban production and construction, and the residents' increasingly urgent demands for political and cultural studies, the number of committee members has been increased in this re-election to strengthen the organizational leadership in residents' production, life, and study. A total of 350 committee members were elected from the city's twenty-seven Residents' Committees. They are all activists with firm stances and enthusiastic service to the masses in the suppression of the rebellion and the democratic reform movement. The vast majority are former Langsheng (house slaves), handicraft workers, and poor residents, of whom women committee members account for about a quarter.

The Lhasa Residents' Committees were established at the request of the broad masses of citizens after the suppression of the rebellion in the Lhasa area this year. In the past six months, the Residents' Committees have played a very good role in leading the masses to develop production, assisting the Municipal Military Control Commission in managing municipal administration, arranging the lives of citizens, and organizing and leading the masses in learning. Before this re-election, the Lhasa Municipal District Committees of the Chinese Communist Party conducted thorough and meticulous education among the masses on the nature of the people's democratic regime and the exercise of democratic rights, and organized residents to study and discuss.

    拉萨改选居民委员会
    四个区96％的居民参加了选举
    新华社拉萨25日电　拉萨市中心四个区的三万多藏、回、汉族居民，认真地选出了居民委员会的工作人员，这四个区的二十七个居民委员会，已经通过民主选举，全部改选结束，约占四个区总人口96％的居民，都参加了选举。
    拉萨市居民委员会的改选工作进行了一个多月。由于市区生产建设逐步发展和居民对政治文化学习的要求日益迫切，各居民委员会在这次改选中都增加了委员人数，以便加强对居民生产、生活和学习等方面的组织领导。全市二十七个居民委员会共选出三百五十名委员，他们都是在平叛斗争和民主改革运动中立场坚定、热心为群众服务的积极分子，绝大多数是过去的朗生（家奴）、手工业者和贫苦居民，其中妇女委员约占四分之一。
    拉萨市居民委员会是今年拉萨地区叛乱平息以后在广大市民的要求下建立的。半年多来，各居民委员会在领导群众发展生产，协助市军事管制委员会管理市政、安排市民生活和组织领导群众学习等方面，都发挥了很好的作用。这次改选前，中共拉萨市各区委会对群众深入细致地进行了关于人民民主政权的性质和行使民主权利的教育，并组织居民学习讨论。
