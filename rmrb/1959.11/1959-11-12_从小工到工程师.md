From Laborer to Engineer

Song Fugi, formerly a laborer at the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory in Korea before liberation, is now the director of the nitrogen-ammonium workshop in the same factory, a state-certified engineer, and a delegate to the Hungnam City People's Congress. The path he has taken reflects the two completely different fates of a Korean worker before and after liberation.

In 1940, Song Fugi, along with many starving peasants, left his hometown and came to Hungnam City, where he worked as a laborer in the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory, run by the Japanese. Japanese capitalists had no regard for the safety of the workers. The sulfuric acid workshop where he worked was filled with gas all day long, making it difficult to breathe. Unable to endure this hardship, he asked the Japanese engineers to find a way to reduce the gas leakage. The factory's response was to transfer him to work in the gas recycling system, where there was even more gas...

He endured this inhumane life until August 15th, when Korea was liberated, and the factory was returned from the hands of Japanese capitalists to the hands of the people themselves. He immediately began to study the problem of reforming the gas recycling system equipment. However, at that time, his education level was very low, and he encountered many things he did not understand. He couldn't even find a book to read. He eagerly hoped to have the opportunity to learn some culture. Just then, a technical college was newly built in Hungnam City, and the factory leaders accepted his request and sent him to this school to study. Before liberation, such a thing was something he dared not even dream of. When he received the admission notice, he was moved to tears.

In order to repay the Party and the People's Government for their concern, Song Fugi persevered in his studies with great diligence. Every day, even if he stayed up all night, he had to understand what he had learned that day. His classmates called him "the man who doesn't sleep."

After graduating, he returned to the factory and completed the task of reforming the gas recycling system equipment.

Not satisfied with his first success, he continued to improve his work and put forward many rationalization proposals, saving a lot of money for the country. Therefore, he was awarded the Medal of Merit and the Third-Class National Flag Medal.

In order to learn more advanced science and technology, he also worked in the factory while studying at the Hamhung Industrial University night school. Even during the war, he worked with the factory's technicians to guard the factory and diligently study in the library and laboratory.

The factory was bombed by enemy planes and suffered serious damage. In order to ensure the production of sulfuric acid, he, together with worker Park Eul-sung (now the deputy secretary of the factory's Party committee), designed and built a small-scale underground sulfuric acid factory, ensuring wartime production.

Song Fugi has many unforgettable days: the day he passed the state certification test and obtained his engineer qualification; the day in November 1956 when the people of Hungnam City elected him as a delegate to the City People's Congress; the day four years ago when he was selected by the state to go to the Stalinogorsk Chemical Combine in the Moscow region of the Soviet Union for an internship... Every time he thinks of these days, he becomes excited and immerses himself in his work even more selflessly.

### 从小工到工程师

    从小工到工程师
    宋福基，解放前是朝鲜兴南肥料厂的一个小工，现在他是这个工厂的氮铵车间主任，是经过国家鉴定合格的工程师，是兴南市人民会议代议员。他所走过的道路，反映出一个朝鲜工人在解放前后的两种完全不同的命运。
    1940年，宋福基同许多饥饿的农民一同离开家乡，来到兴南市，在日本人开办的兴南肥料厂当小工。日本资本家根本不把工人的安全放在眼里。他所在的硫酸车间，整天弥漫着瓦斯，干活时连气也喘不过来。他受不了这种难堪的折磨，要求日本工程师想办法减少瓦斯漏气。厂方回答是，把他调到瓦斯更多的瓦斯循环系统工作……。
    他忍受着这种非人的生活，一直到“八·一五”朝鲜解放，工厂从日本资本家手里回到了人民自己的手里。他立即就开始研究改造瓦斯循环系统设备的问题，但是，当时他的文化水平很低，碰到许多自己不懂的事情，想找本书看看也没办法。他迫切渴望能够有机会学点文化。刚好这时在兴南市新建了一座技术专科学校，工厂领导上接受了他的要求，把他送到这个学校去学习。在解放前，这种事，真是连梦也不敢做。当他接到入学通知单时，他感动得流下了眼泪。
    为了报答党和人民政府对他的关怀，宋福基十分刻苦地坚持学习。每天，那怕是通宵不眠，他也要把当天学到的东西弄明白。同学们说他是“不睡觉的人”。
    毕业后，他回到工厂，完成了瓦斯循环系统设备的改造任务。
    他不为自己所取得第一个成功而满足，继续不断改进工作，提出许多合理化建议，为国家节省了大量资金。因此他荣获了功劳奖章和三级国旗勋章。
    他为了学习更高深的科学技术，又一面在工厂工作，一面在咸兴工业大学夜校学习。即使在战争时期，他也同工厂的技术人员一起，一面守卫工厂，一面利用图书室和实验室不懈地进行学习。
    工厂被敌机轰炸，遭到了严重的破坏。他为保证硫酸的生产，同工人朴乙成（现任工厂党委副委员长）一起设计并建设了小规模的地下硫酸工厂，保证了战时生产。
    宋福基有许多难忘的日子：他通过国家鉴定测验荣获工程师资格的日子；1956年11月，兴南市人民选他为市人民会议代议员的日子；四年前他由国家选派前往苏联莫斯科州斯大里诺哥尔斯克化学联合厂实习的日子……。每当他想起这些日子的时候，他就兴奋地更加忘我地投入工作。
