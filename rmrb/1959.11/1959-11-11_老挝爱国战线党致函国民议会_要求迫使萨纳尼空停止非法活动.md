Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th: "Lao Patriotic News" published on the 3rd a letter written on October 21st by Phay Dang, Vice Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, on behalf of the Central Committee of the party, to the Lao National Assembly, requesting the National Assembly to force the Sananikone government to cancel the "trial" of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front Party and to stop the civil war.

The letter said, "The Sananikone government is preparing to try Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, and other leaders of the party, as well as some cadres of the party, most of whom are members of parliament. This action makes us and the entire Lao people feel very worried and extremely angry."

The letter said, "The above-mentioned actions of the Sananikone government are part of a plan consistently pursued by U.S. imperialism, the purpose of which is to undermine the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, to undermine Laos' policy of peace and neutrality, and to undermine the national harmony of the Lao people." The letter pointed out that preparing to "try" Prince Souphanouvong and others is a very dangerous and blatant new step by the U.S.-Sananikone clique, "the purpose of which is to eliminate the leading organs and cadres of the Lao Patriotic Front Party and to打击 (attack/suppress) the Lao people's patriotic spirit against U.S. imperialism. This action has already caused great losses to our motherland, especially hindering the Lao Patriotic Front Party's repeatedly proposed suggestions to solve the Lao problem through peaceful consultation, thereby prolonging and expanding the civil war, allowing U.S. imperialism to continue to deepen its interference in Laos."

The letter said that "trying" Prince Souphanouvong and other imprisoned leaders and cadres of the Lao Patriotic Front Party is not only a despicable violation of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, not only trampling on the democratic and free rights of the Lao people, but also violates the current constitution and laws of the Kingdom of Laos, as most of the "defendants" are members of parliament and they fully enjoy the trust of the people.

The letter finally requested the Chairman of the National Assembly and all members of parliament, for the lofty interests of the country and the people, to force the Sananikone government to immediately stop the civil war, stop the discrimination, retaliation, and persecution against the Lao Patriotic Front Party and former Lao resistance personnel, stop the persecution and "sweeps" against the people, restore the freedom of the imprisoned former Pathet Lao fighting forces cadres and former Lao resistance personnel, especially to force the Sananikone government to cancel the "trial" of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, as well as the cadres of the former Pathet Lao fighting forces, and restore their freedom, restore the power of the National Assembly, and peacefully resolve the Lao problem on the basis of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements.

    老挝爱国战线党致函国民议会
    要求迫使萨纳尼空停止非法活动
    新华社河内10日电　“老挝爱国新闻”3日发表了老挝爱国战线党副主席费当代表这个党的中央委员会在10月21日写给老挝国民议会的一封信，要求国民议会迫使萨纳尼空政府取消对苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的“审判”，并且停止内战。
    信中说，“萨纳尼空政府正在准备审判老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王和党的其他领导人以及党的一些干部，其中大部分是议员。这种行动，使我们和全体老挝人民感到十分忧虑和无比愤怒。”
    这封信说，“萨纳尼空政府的上述行动，是美帝国主义一贯推行的计划的一部分，这个计划的目的是破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议，破坏老挝的和平中立政策，破坏老挝人民的民族和睦。”信中指出，准备“审判”苏发努冯亲王等这一做法，是美萨集团的一个非常危险的明目张胆的新步骤，“其目的在于消灭老挝爱国战线党领导机关和干部，打击老挝人民反对美帝国主义的爱国主义精神。这种行动已经给我们的祖国造成了巨大损失，特别是阻挠老挝爱国战线党曾经多次提出的以和平协商方式来解决老挝问题的建议，从而延长和扩大了内战，让美帝国主义继续加深对老挝的干涉。”
    信中说，“审判”苏发努冯亲王和被监禁的老挝爱国战线党其他领导人和干部，不仅是卑鄙的违反日内瓦协议和万象协议的行为，不仅蹂躏老挝人民的民主、自由权利，而且还违反老挝王国现行宪法和法律，大部分“被告”都是议员，他们完全得到人民的信任。
    信中最后要求国民议会议长和所有议员们，为了国家和人民的崇高利益，迫使萨纳尼空政府立即停止内战，停止对老挝爱国战线党和老挝前抗战人员的歧视、报复和迫害，停止对人民的迫害和“扫荡”，恢复被监禁的前寮国战斗部队干部和老挝前抗战人员的自由，特别是迫使萨纳尼空政府取消对苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人以及前寮国战斗部队的干部的“审判”并恢复他们的自由，恢复国民议会的权力，并且在日内瓦协议和万象协议的基础上和平解决老挝问题。
