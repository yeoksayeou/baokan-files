Liu Xinguo, a young heroic driver from the Qaidam Transportation Bureau in Qinghai, has overfulfilled the state transportation plan ahead of schedule for two consecutive years. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, he and his assistant, driving a GAZ-51 truck, completed the state's annual single-vehicle transportation plan 145 days ahead of schedule, completing two years and seven months' worth of work in one year. In the continuing Great Leap Forward of 1959, they completed the state's annual transportation plan 256 days ahead of schedule. In August, they achieved a high-yield record of 18,731 ton-kilometers. By the end of September, the truck he drove had completed a total transportation turnover of 466,556 ton-kilometers, equivalent to 285.38% of the plan, striding into 1961.

Why is Liu Xinguo able to continuously set high production records in automobile transportation?

Using large trailers for long-distance transportation is a good way for the transportation front to fully utilize and tap the potential of automobile equipment and improve transportation efficiency. Last year, Liu Xinguo successfully used large trailers on long-distance highway transportation lines at an altitude of more than 3,000 meters, and achieved remarkable results, which is a major event on the highway transportation front.

Speaking of which, there is a tortuous process in between. Last year, the Qaidam Transportation Bureau bought a four-ton large trailer and allocated it to the first detachment of the first team. The first team selected an experienced driver to use a GAZ truck to tow it for long-distance transportation. After two trips, the driver felt that it was slow and unsafe to drive, so he stopped the experiment. Since then, this large trailer has become an "exhibit." Last August, when the leadership called for making every effort to tap transportation potential and overfulfill the annual task, trainee driver Liu Xinguo put his mind to this large trailer. He calculated a detailed account: without a trailer, it would take three days to transport ore from Xitieshan to the Xiaodong Railway Station in Gansu, a round trip of 1,260 kilometers. With a trailer, it would take four days for a round trip. Although it is one day slower than without a trailer, the transportation volume is doubled. He happily thought: Isn't this the potential of transportation? He also thought: Although this highway passes through the relatively difficult Dangjin Mountain, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level, the road surface is relatively wide and flat. This favorable condition should be fully utilized!

So, Liu Xinguo started the experiment. The car drove into Dangjin Mountain, he put it in first gear, and stepped on the accelerator to the end, but the car still moved forward like a tortoise. It took more than four hours to cross the forty-mile Dangjin Mountain. The first experiment failed. The second experiment failed again... He thought: Can it be calculated like this? No, the road is made by people, and the experiment must be successful. The Party branch of the first team of automobiles learned about this situation and immediately gave him support and encouragement, which strengthened his confidence even more. So, Liu Xinguo started the fifth experiment. This time, it took four days to transport nine tons of ore back and forth, and the experiment was successful. Later, it was even shortened to one round trip every three days. Since this year, Liu Xinguo and his assistant have successfully driven a GAZ truck to tow a four-ton large trailer for long-distance transportation, and have excellently completed the task without any major or minor accidents. Under his inspiration and leadership, more than 90 automobiles in the Qaidam Transportation Bureau have now been equipped with large trailers, and are gradually moving towards the train of automobiles.

In the transportation with trailers, Liu Xinguo and his assistant have always been in the lead, and they can load more and run faster with the same car. What is the reason for this?

Based on the long loading and unloading time and the waste of transportation capacity, Liu Xinguo carefully studied and came up with an improvement method. When they drive to the delivery location, they divide the work with their assistants: one person drives the car to deliver the goods, and the other person goes to register and eat. Then, the person who has eaten drives the car to load the goods, and the person who unloads the goods goes to eat. If there are many vehicles at the loading and unloading locations and the loaders are too busy, they will take the initiative to help with loading and unloading. Because they have rationally arranged the loading, unloading, registration and other procedures, they can strive for more than four hours of driving time for each round trip.

Liu Xinguo and his assistant usually do a lot of maintenance work on the car. They repair general faults themselves, so the car breaks down less often, goes to the factory for repairs less often, requires fewer materials, has high work efficiency, and low cost. Liu Xinguo can also arrange the entire month's plan according to the monthly tasks, vehicle driving routes, vehicle conditions, etc., and arrange the departure time, meals, and rest places on a daily basis, so that "no time is wasted, and every minute is contested."

Liu Xinguo has summed up an experience in actual operation: "Three no's and two concentrations." The three no's are: no complacency, no arrogance, and no driving a "hero car"; the two concentrations are: concentration of thought and concentration of energy. Liu Xinguo not only pays attention to summing up and accumulating experience in actual operation, but also pays special attention to learning from other people's experience. Whenever the car is sent to the factory for repair, they also discuss with the repair workers to find out the cause of the disease, prescribe the "prescription," and consult for treatment. In this way, not only is the quality of car repair high, but also time is saved.

Giving convenience to others and keeping difficulties to oneself is Liu Xinguo's consistent style. Comrades in the Qaidam Transportation Bureau, especially those drivers, can tell you many such stories. Once, driver Li Tianzhang broke down in Dunhuang because of a flat tire. When Liu Xinguo arrived, he gave his only spare tire to Li Tianzhang to use and helped him repair the car. Driver Guo Zhenting's car broke down in Delingha because the car's fuel pump was broken. When Liu Xinguo drove over, he saw that the broken-down car was loaded with urgently needed chemical raw materials, so he took the initiative to disassemble the fuel pump from his car and helped install it, so that Guo Zhenting's car could drive away first; then he repaired the broken fuel pump for several hours and installed it on his car for use.

Liu Xinguo often said to his assistant: "We should help others more. Our car can run at most 20,000 ton-kilometers per month. If only our car runs, it won't work even if we run 100,000. If all the cars in the bureau can load more and run faster, and everyone is advanced, the beautiful scenery of Qaidam construction can be realized sooner." This is why he can be selfless and always think of others.

Because of Liu Xinguo's infinite loyalty to the Party and the cause of socialist construction, the Party and the people have given him great honor. He has won the "Youth Commando" medal awarded by the Qaidam Work Committee of the Communist Youth League twice. In January of this year, he attended the Provincial Advanced Producer Representatives Conference. In July, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League awarded him a certificate for his outstanding achievements in the two activities of tackling key problems and saving materials in 1959; in August, the Committee of the Communist Party of China Qaidam Transportation Bureau awarded him the honorary title of "Young Hero Driver"; this time, he gloriously attended the National "Heroes" Conference.

    刘新国巧用大拖车
    青海柴达木交通局青年英雄司机刘新国，连续两年提前超额完成国家运输计划。在大跃进的1958年，他和他的助手驾驶的吉斯150型汽车曾经提前一百四十五天完成国家年度单车运输计划，一年完成了两年零七个月的任务，在继续跃进的1959年又提前二百五十六天完成了国家年度运输计划。8月份创造了一万八千七百三十一吨公里的高产纪录。到9月底，他驾驶的汽车共完成运输周转量四十六万六千五百五十六吨公里，相当于计划的285.38％，阔步跨入了1961年。
    刘新国为什么能够连续创汽车运输高产纪录呢？
    长途运输使用大拖车，这是运输战线充分利用、挖掘汽车设备潜力，提高运输效率的一种好办法。去年刘新国成功地把大拖车利用到拔海三千多米的长途公路运输线上，并取得了显著成绩，是公路运输战线上的一件大事。
    说起来，这中间还有一段曲折的过程。去年柴达木交通局买进了一辆四吨大拖车，拨给了汽车一队一分队，一分队选了一位老司机，用吉斯车拖带跑长途运输，跑了两趟，这位司机认为跑得慢，行车不安全，就停止了试验。从此这辆大拖车就成了“展览品”。去年8月，领导上提出千方百计挖掘运输潜力，超额完成全年任务的号召时，实习司机刘新国在这部大拖车上动了脑筋，他算了一笔细账：不带拖车从锡铁山装矿石往返甘肃峡东火车站一千二百六十公里要三天的时间，带上拖车往返以四天时间计算，虽然比不带拖车慢一天，但运输量却增加一倍。他高兴地想道：这不正是运输的潜力吗？他又想：这条公路虽然经过四千多米比较难走的当金山，但路面还是比较宽阔平坦的。应该充分利用这有利条件！
    于是，刘新国开始了试验。汽车驶进当金山，他挂上一档，油门踩到底，汽车仍然像乌龟一样向前移动着。当越过四十里路的当金山时，整整行驶了四个多小时。第一次试验就这样失败了。第二次试验又失败了……他想：能这样算了吗？不能，路是人走出来的，一定要试验成功。汽车一队党支部知道了这种情况，立即给了他支持和鼓励，这就更加强了他的信心。于是，刘新国又开始了第五次试验。这次，装了九吨矿石往返用了四天时间，试验成功了。后来竟缩短到三天往返一次。今年以来，刘新国和他的助手一起成功地驾驶着吉斯车拖带四吨大拖车跑长途运输，出色地完成了任务，从未发生过大小事故。在他的启发和带动下，目前柴达木交通局已有九十多部汽车带上了大拖车，并逐步走向汽车列车化。
    在带拖车的运输中，刘新国和他的助手始终领先，而且同样的车，他们能多装快跑，这是什么原因呢？
    刘新国根据装卸货时间长、浪费运力的情况，经过仔细研究，想出了一个改进的办法。他们行车到送货地点就和助手分工：一个人驾车去送货，另一个人去登记、吃饭，然后吃过饭的人驾车去装货，卸车的人再去吃饭。如果装卸货物地点车多，装卸工忙不过来，他们就主动帮助装卸。由于他们合理地安排了装货、卸货、登记等工序，每往返一次就多争取四个多小时的行车时间。
    刘新国和他的助手平时对汽车保养工作作得相当勤，一般的毛病都是自己动手修理，所以车子抛锚少、进厂修的少、材料领的少，工作效率高，成本费用低。刘新国还能根据每月的任务、车辆行驶路线、车辆状况等安排全月的计划，并按日安排出车时间，吃饭、休息地方等，做到了“时不空过、分秒必争”。
    刘新国在实际操作中，摸索出一条经验：“三不、两集中”。三不是：不麻痹大意，不骄傲自满，不开“英雄车”；两集中是：思想集中，精力集中。刘新国不但在实际操作中注意摸索积累经验，而且还特别注意学习别人的经验。每当车子进厂修理时，他们还和修理工人一块商量找出病源，开出“药方”，会诊治疗。这样，不但修车质量高，而且节约时间。
    把方便送给别人，把困难留给自己，这是刘新国一贯的作风。柴达木交通局的同志特别是那些司机同志，可以告诉你许多这样的故事。有一次，司机李天章因轮胎坏了抛锚在敦煌，刘新国赶到时，就把自己仅有的一条备用轮胎给李天章使用，并且帮助他把车子修理好。司机郭振停因为汽车的汽泵坏了，车子抛锚在德令哈，刘新国驾车赶来时，看到抛锚车上装的是急用的化工原料，就主动把自己车子上的汽泵拆下来并帮助装好，让郭振停的车子先开走；然后他把坏汽泵用了几个小时的时间修好，装在自己车子上使用。
    刘新国常对自己的助手说：“我们应该多帮助别人。我们一部车一月顶多能跑两万来个车吨公里，如果光我们这一部车跑，再跑十万也不行。如果全局的车都能多装快跑，大家都先进，柴达木建设美景就能早日实现。”这就是他为什么能够舍己为公，处处为别人着想的原因。
    刘新国由于对党和社会主义建设事业的无限忠诚，党和人民给予他以极大的荣誉。他曾先后两次获得共青团柴达木工委授予的“青年突击手”奖章，今年1月份出席了省先进生产者代表会议，7月，共青团中央授给他在1959年攻关键、省材料两项活动中获得显著成绩的奖状；8月，中共柴达木交通局委员会授予他“青年英雄司机”的光荣称号；这次，他又光荣地出席了全国“群英”大会。
