    Conduct Specific Situation Education, Systematically Explain Theoretical Knowledge:
    Northwestern University Strengthens Ideological Education
    Promoting an Overall Leap Forward in Teaching, Productive Labor, and Scientific Research

    (Our Newspaper News) The Northwestern University Party Committee has adopted active measures to strengthen political and ideological education, greatly promoting an overall leap forward in teaching, productive labor, and scientific research.

    Currently, the teachers and students of this school are in high spirits and full of political enthusiasm. Teachers and students are striving to join the Party and the League. For example, more than half of the professors and lecturers in the Economics Department have applied to join the Party, and 88% of the young people in Class C of the second year of the Mathematics Department have applied to join the League. Subscriptions to newspapers and periodicals are very common. Every issue of the "Red Flag" magazine is sold out as soon as it arrives at the school, and the newspaper reading columns are immediately surrounded by readers after class. The enthusiasm for teaching is also growing. Teachers often prepare lessons and correct homework until late at night. Senior professors personally teach basic courses and guide experimental classes. For example, Vice President Yue Jieheng teaches "Theoretical Mechanics," Physics Department Director Jiang Renshou teaches "Analytical Mechanics," and Chemistry Department Professor Cao Juju personally guides students in the "Organic Chemistry Experiment" course. Students are studying even more diligently, especially delving into their coursework. For example, history students travel dozens of miles to the Banpo Museum to collect materials in order to clarify a question; geography students prepare an outline for a "classroom discussion" that requires reading at least three reference books. Students are not only diligent in their studies but also actively engaged in labor. For example, students in the second, third, and fourth years of the Chinese Department went to the countryside to help farmers fight drought and protect autumn crops as their first lesson after the start of the semester. Second-year students majoring in botany in the Biology Department completed half a year's worth of making plant wax leaf specimens in just two months. At the same time, scientific research at the school is booming with fruitful results. For example, more than forty teachers in the Biology Department participated in the work of thirty research projects. Since the beginning of this year, the school has completed more than eighty research projects; since the beginning of this semester, more than forty academic report discussion meetings have been held. The Chinese and History departments and others conduct an academic research activity every week.

    Northwestern University focuses on strengthening political and ideological education work in two aspects. On the one hand, it carries out situation education centered on studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party; on the other hand, it strengthens the systematic teaching of Marxist-Leninist theory.

    After the publication of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party, the school Party Committee immediately used the spirit of the documents to arm the political thoughts of the teachers and students. Six hours per week were set aside for studying and discussing the documents. In the process of studying and discussion, in view of the ideological situation of the teachers and students, seven special reports were organized, such as "On the General Line of Socialist Construction," "On the People's Communes," and "On the Educational Revolution." For example, the report "On the General Line of Socialist Construction" made by Liu Duanfen, the First Secretary of the Party Committee, was based on the understanding of the teachers and students, listing many facts of the Great Leap Forward, explaining the greatness of the general line, and helping the teachers and students use the correct stance, viewpoint, and method to analyze the current excellent situation. Teachers and students generally reflected that the report made them improve their understanding, distinguish between right and wrong, and expressed their determination to reject right-leaning tendencies, boost their energy, and forever hold high the red flag of the Party's general line and stride forward. In order to deepen the educational effect, the school Party Committee, in addition to mobilizing more than sixty political teachers throughout the school to conduct tutoring, also organized teachers and students to go to people's communes and factories to watch the new upsurge of the Great Leap Forward; mobilized teachers and students to combine the great achievements of the educational revolution and held a school-wide exhibition of "Three Major Harvests of Teaching, Productive Labor, and Scientific Research."

    This semester, the school has greatly strengthened the systematic teaching of Marxist-Leninist theory. They have newly opened three political theory courses: "Philosophy," "Socialism," and "History of the Communist Party of China." Each grade level of students throughout the school studies one political theory course. First-year students study "History of the Communist Party of China," second-year students study "Socialism," third-year students study "Philosophy," and fourth-year students study "Political Economy." Most of the teachers who teach these four political theory courses have participated in long-term labor training and rural investigation work, and they prepared lessons in the previous semester.

    Party committee leaders frequently contacting a department, deeply understanding the ideological situation, and helping to solve specific problems are also one of the important measures taken by this school to strengthen political and ideological education. For example, Liu Duanfen, the First Secretary of the Party Committee, often talks with teachers and students. He found that some students neglected labor after the school advocated diligent study, so he immediately explained to the students the principle of both studying well and laboring well. This timely overcame the wrong ideas among the students.

    具体进行形势教育　系统讲解理论知识
    西北大学加强思想教育
    推动了教学、生产劳动和科学研究全面跃进
    本报讯　西北大学党委采取积极措施加强政治思想教育，大大地推动了教学、生产劳动和科学研究全面跃进。
    目前，这个学校广大师生心情舒畅、政治热情高涨。师生们争取积极入党入团，如经济系有一半以上的教授、讲师申请入党；数学系二年级丙班88％的青年申请入团。订阅报刊的人非常普遍，每期“红旗”杂志一到学校，就被一购而光，一下课，阅报栏立刻围满了读者。教学的劲头也越来越大。教师们常常备课、批改作业直到深夜。老教授们亲自讲授基础课和指导实验课。如副校长岳劼恒讲“理论力学”、物理系主任江仁寿讲“分析力学”、化学系教授曹居久亲自指导学生作“有机化学实验”课的实验。学生们更加认真读书，尤其是刻苦钻研功课。如历史系学生为了弄清一个疑题，跑几十里路去半坡博物馆搜集资料；地理系学生准备“课堂讨论”一个发言提纲，至少要看三本参考书。学生们不但勤奋读书，也积极劳动。如中文系二、三、四年级学生开学以后第一课，就下乡帮助农民抗旱保秋。生物系植物专业二年级学生，仅用两个月时间就完成了半年的制作植物蜡叶标本的任务。与此同时，学校的科学研究热气腾腾、成果累累。如生物系四十多位教师就参加了三十个研究项目的工作。今年以来，全校已经完成了八十多个研究项目；这学期开学以来已经举办了四十多次学术报告讨论会。中文、历史等系每周都进行一次学术研究活动。
    西北大学着重从两个方面加强政治思想教育工作。一方面，开展以学习党的八中全会文件为中心内容的形势教育；另方面，加强系统的马克思列宁主义理论教学。
    党的八中全会文件公布以后，学校党委立即用文件的精神来武装全校师生的政治思想。每周抽出六个小时为学习讨论文件的时间。在学习讨论过程中，针对师生的思想情况，组织了“关于社会主义建设总路线问题”、“关于人民公社的问题”、“关于教育革命的问题”等七个专题报告。如党委第一书记刘端棻所作“关于社会主义建设总路线的问题”报告，就是根据师生的认识，列举许多跃进的事实，说明总路线的伟大，帮助师生用正确的立场、观点和方法来分析目前的大好形势。师生普遍反映，报告使他们提高了认识、分清了是非，并表示要把右倾反掉、把干劲鼓足，永远高举党的总路线红旗阔步前进。为了加深教育效果，学校党委除了动员全校六十多位政治教师进行辅导以外，还分别组织师生到人民公社、工厂观看跃进新高潮；发动全校师生结合教育革命的伟大成果，举办了全校性的“教学、生产劳动和科学研究三大丰收”的展览会。
    这学期，这个学校大大加强了系统的马克思列宁主义理论的教学。他们新开了“哲学”、“社会主义”、“中国共产党史”等三门政治理论课。全校每个年级学生各学一门政治理论，一年级学生学习“中国共产党史”，二年级学生学习“社会主义”，三年级学生学习“哲学”，四年级学生学习“政治经济学”。担任这四门政治理论课的教师，大部分都参加过长期的劳动锻炼和农村调查工作，而且在上学期就进行了备课。
    党委负责人经常联系一个系，深入了解思想情况，帮助解决具体问题，也是这个学校加强政治思想教育的重要措施之一。如党委第一书记刘端棻常常找教师、学生交谈。他发现学校提倡认真读书以后有些学生忽视劳动，就立即向学生讲清既要学习好又要劳动好的道理。这就及时地克服了同学中错误思想。
