Xinhua News Agency, November 24th:
The capital's cultural circles held a commemorative meeting today to mark the centenary of the birth of the world cultural figure Sholem Aleichem. The meeting was presided over by Mao Dun, Standing Committee Member of the World Peace Council, Standing Committee Member of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association. In his speech, he said: Sholem Aleichem was a great realist writer in modern Jewish literature. Sholem Aleichem's life was closely connected with the poor working people, and his works reflected the tragic fate of the Jewish people under the dual oppression of the Tsarist autocracy and the Jewish bourgeoisie at that time. His works ruthlessly attacked the cruel system of human exploitation and were full of confidence in the bright future of mankind. Throughout his works, there is a sense of poignant and touching humor. Mao Dun said: Sholem Aleichem was a poet, a novelist, a playwright, and a literary critic. The great works he left behind have enriched the world's cultural treasury and become the common spiritual wealth of people all over the world. For the cause of human progress, for the defense of peace, and for the development of cultural exchange between nations, it is of great significance that we are here today to solemnly commemorate the centenary of Sholem Aleichem's birth.

Cao Jinghua, a council member of the Chinese Writers Association, gave a detailed introduction to Sholem Aleichem's life and works at the meeting. He said that Sholem Aleichem, an outstanding Jewish writer of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, was born in the city of Pereyaslav in Ukraine. His creations inherited the excellent traditions of advanced Russian literature. He had contact with contemporary Russian literary masters such as Leo Tolstoy, Korolenko, Kuprin, Chekhov, and Gorky, and was influenced by them. Cao Jinghua said: Sholem Aleichem's works were widely circulated in Russia and other countries before the October Revolution. After the October Revolution, his works were translated into twelve national languages in the Soviet Union and printed nearly five hundred times. In 1925, his works were introduced to China. More than thirty short stories have been introduced to China. Sholem Aleichem's creations are a precious legacy in the progressive human literary treasury, and we must accept it well.

The commemorative meeting was jointly organized by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Exchange with Foreign Countries, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Chinese Writers Association, and the Beijing Library. Well-known figures from the capital's cultural and artistic circles, including Ding Xilin, Shao Quanlin, Wu Zuoren, and Xiao San, attended the meeting. After the meeting, actors from the Beijing People's Art Theater recited excerpts from Sholem Aleichem's famous work "Motl the Cantor's Son".

To commemorate the centenary of Sholem Aleichem's birth, Beijing and Shanghai have recently published Sholem Aleichem's famous works "From the Fair" and the short story collection "A Big Win, A Quick Loss" and others. The Beijing Library has also specially arranged a small book exhibition of Sholem Aleichem's works.

    肖洛姆·阿莱汉姆诞生一百周年
    首都文化界举行纪念会
    新华社24日讯　首都文化界，今天举行了世界文化名人肖洛姆·阿莱汉姆诞生一百周年纪念会。纪念会由世界和平理事会常务委员会委员、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员、中国文学艺术界联合会副主席、中国作家协会主席茅盾主持，他致词说：肖洛姆·阿莱汉姆是近代犹太文学中伟大的现实主义作家。肖洛姆的一生和穷苦劳动人民有着密切的联系，他的作品反映了当时在沙皇专制制度和犹太资产阶级双重压榨下犹太人民的悲惨命运。他的作品无情地打击了残酷的人剥削人的社会制度，对人类光明的未来充满了信心。在他的作品中，处处流露出辛酸而感人的幽默。茅盾说：肖洛姆是诗人，是小说家，是戏剧家，又是文学批评家。他所遗留下来的伟大作品丰富了世界文化宝库，成为全世界人民共同的精神财富。为了人类进步事业，为了保卫和平，为了发展各民族之间的文化交流，我们今天在这里隆重纪念肖洛姆诞生一百周年是具有重要意义的。
    中国作家协会理事曹靖华在会上详细介绍了肖洛姆的生平和作品。他说，十九世纪末二十世纪初杰出的犹太作家肖洛姆·阿莱汉姆，出生在乌克兰别列亚斯拉夫城。他的创作继承了俄罗斯先进文学的优秀传统。他和同时代的俄国文学大师列夫·托尔斯泰、柯罗连柯、库普林、契柯夫、高尔基等都有交往，并受过他们的影响。曹靖华说：肖洛姆的作品十月革命前就在俄国和其他国家广泛流传。十月革命后他的作品在苏联译成了十二种民族文字，印行了将近五百次。1925年他的作品被介绍到中国。先后介绍到中国的短篇小说就有三十多篇。肖洛姆的创作，是进步人类文学宝库中珍贵遗产之一，我们要把它很好的接受过来。
    纪念会是中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国人民对外文化协会、中国文学艺术界联合会、中国作家协会、北京图书馆联合举办的。首都文化艺术界著名人士丁西林、邵荃麟、吴作人、萧三等出席了纪念会。会后由北京人民艺术剧院演员朗颂了肖洛姆名作“莫吐儿”的片断。
    为了纪念肖洛姆诞辰一百周年，北京和上海新近出版了肖洛姆的名著“从集市上来”和短篇集“一场欢喜一场空”等。北京图书馆还专门布置了肖洛姆著作的小型图书展览。
