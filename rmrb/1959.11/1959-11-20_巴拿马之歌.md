Panama Song
    Liu Lanshan
This morning I read the newspaper, my heart flew to Panama; at night I turned on the radio, I heard Panama speaking.
Far away on the other side of the earth, what a beautiful country—
	The Pacific Ocean strokes your back,
	The Atlantic Ocean washes your feet.
There is a green belt,
	Tightly binding your slender waist;
The two ends are grabbed by the American Yankees,
	This noose around your neck.
The American Yankees have put up iron fences in front of your door;
The American Yankees graze warhorses behind your house.
It eats your flesh, drinks your blood,
Rides on your back, whipping you year after year.
Your national flag cannot fly in the sky over Panama;
Your people cannot freely walk in their own country...

The wind comes from the East, blowing into the Caribbean Strait;
You jump up, shaking Central America.
Drive away the American Yankees, your supporting hands are everywhere;
Scoop up the water from the two oceans, washing away the man-eating American capitalists.
In the soaring east wind, I sing of the newly rising morning sun,
Oh wind that crosses the ocean, please carry this song to Panama.

    巴拿马之歌
    刘岚山早晨我读着报纸，心儿飞到了巴拿马；夜晚打开收音机，我听见巴拿马在说话。远在地球那边多美丽的国家——太平洋抚着你的背，大西洋洗着你的脚。有一根绿色的带子，把你的蜂腰紧紧捆扎；两头抓在美国佬手上，这根套着你颈子的绞索。美国佬在你门前，扎上了铁篱笆；美国佬在你屋后，牧放着战马。它吃着你的肉，喝着你的鲜血，骑在你的背上，成年累月把你抽打。你的国旗不能飘扬在巴拿马天空下；你的人民不能自由地行走在自己的国家……风从东方来，吹入加勒比海峡；你一跳站起来，震动了中亚美利加。赶走美国佬，支援你的手遍天下；舀起两洋的水，冲跑吃人的美国资本家。我在昂扬的东风里，歌唱着初升的朝霞，漂洋过海的风呵，请把这歌声带到巴拿马。
