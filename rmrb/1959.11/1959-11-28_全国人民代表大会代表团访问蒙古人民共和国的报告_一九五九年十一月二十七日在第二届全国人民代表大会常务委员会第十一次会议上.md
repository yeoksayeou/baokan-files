Report on the Visit of the National People's Congress Delegation to the Mongolian People's Republic
On November 27, 1959, at the 11th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Second National People's Congress
Head of the National People's Congress Delegation Lin Boqu

Chairman, fellow members:

The National People's Congress Delegation paid a friendly visit to the Mongolian People's Republic, departing on August 26th and returning on September 5th. As soon as the delegation entered the border of the Mongolian People's Republic—the Zamyn-Üüd railway station—it was welcomed by Lhamsüren, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, and the leading comrades of the Dornogovi Province party and government, and a warm mass welcome meeting was held at the station. At 11:00 am on August 28th, the delegation arrived in Ulaanbaatar. Tsend, Second Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, Molomjamts, Acting Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Jalkhjavyn Jamiyan, Chairman of the Great People's Khural, and other leading party and government comrades greeted the delegation at the station, and a grand mass welcome meeting was held. This grand reception demonstrated the importance that the Mongolian People's Republic attached to the visit of our NPC delegation and the depth of Sino-Mongolian friendship. All the comrades in the delegation were deeply moved.

During the visit, Sambuu, Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Khural of the Mongolian People's Republic, and Tsend, Molomjamts, Jalkhjavyn Jamiyan, and other leading party and government comrades received all the comrades of the delegation and held cordial talks. They highly praised China's construction achievements over the past ten years, especially the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the rural people's communes since 1958, regarding China's achievements as their own. They fully agreed with the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, considering it an important resolution that summarized the experiences of the Great Leap Forward and continued to leap forward. They highly valued the deep friendship between the people of China and Mongolia and repeatedly mentioned China's help to the Mongolian people during the talks. To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of our country, they decided to carry out fifteen days of Sino-Mongolian friendship activities throughout the country.

We saw that the people of the Mongolian People's Republic were making unremitting efforts to realize the Three-Year Plan. Great achievements have been made in industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production. There are now more than 23 million livestock in the country, an average of 27 per person. Agricultural and pastoral cooperativization has been completed, which is a great victory. Agriculture has developed greatly, with a planting area of 153,000 hectares. This year, it is also planned to reclaim 120,000 hectares of wasteland, and by 1961, it will be possible to achieve complete self-sufficiency in flour. In terms of industry, there are food industry, leather processing industry, construction industry, textile industry, power industry, and mining industry, etc. With the development of industry, the ranks of the Mongolian working class have grown, and the number of employees has now reached more than 100,000. In terms of culture and education, the Mongolian People's Republic has established a complete education system and trained more than 3,500 senior intellectuals and more than 13,000 secondary intellectuals. At present, one out of every six people in the country is studying in school. Illiteracy has been basically eliminated throughout the country, and compulsory primary education has been popularized.

We learned about the work of the Great People's Khural and the state administrative organs of the Mongolian People's Republic. The Third Great People's Khural was elected by citizens on June 16, 1957. A total of 500,947 people participated in the vote, accounting for 99.99% of all voters. Among them, 99.98% of voters voted for the candidates of the party and non-party alliance, electing 233 representatives. Workers (including agricultural workers) accounted for 21.5% of the representatives, herdsmen accounted for 32.3%, and intellectuals and cadres accounted for 46.2%, which fully demonstrates that the Great People's Khural has realized the broadest democracy. The basic unit of the administrative organ is the county (the township level has been abolished). The county and commune have been merged. The county head is also the cooperative director, which can not only streamline personnel but also strengthen work efficiency and strengthen leadership over production. It is a very good organizational form.

We visited the dairy processing plant and the Choibalsan Industrial Complex in Ulaanbaatar. The dairy processing plant was built with the help of the Soviet Union in 1957 and put into production at the end of 1958. The equipment is brand new, and the degree of electrification and automation is very high. According to the design capacity, it processes 30 tons per day and 10,000 tons of dairy products per year, producing 14 kinds of dairy products. The plant has a staffing quota of more than 240 people and has eight fresh milk collection stations in other places. During the visit, they treated us with delicious dairy products, which were very tasty. The Choibalsan Industrial Complex was built in 1931 with the help of the Soviet Union and put into production in 1934. It is one of the earliest modern joint factories in Mongolia with more than 2,300 employees. There are workshops for leather making, leather clothing, leather boxes, felt boots, felt, textiles, and shoe making. This year, a wool textile factory has been expanded, with an annual output of 1.19 million yards of wool, and 100,000 felt pieces. In three years of production, the national average will have a set of wool clothing; a tanning factory with an annual output of 1.2 million refined sheepskins and a shoe factory with an annual output of 1.2 million pairs of shoes are being expanded. After these two factories are fully built and put into production, in addition to meeting the daily needs of the people of the whole country, a large amount of products will also be exported.

We visited a pastoral cooperative and a state-owned farm outside Ulaanbaatar. The Bayan-Ovoo pastoral cooperative is 70 kilometers away from Ulaanbaatar. Comrade Balam, the director of the cooperative, was originally the deputy provincial governor and was a cadre who was transferred to the lower levels in 1956. The cooperative has 923 households, 3,218 people, more than 1,700 members, and more than 1,200 laborers. Each working day can earn six tugriks (two tugriks are equivalent to one yuan in RMB). Social insurance is provided for the widowed and lonely who have lost their ability to work, and their lives can be guaranteed. The cooperative has more than 54,000 livestock, and the members have more than 22,000 livestock for their own use. The cooperative attaches great importance to agriculture. This year, it planted more than 200 hectares of oats, more than 20 hectares of peas, and 150 hectares of wheat. The wheat planting area is planned to be expanded to 3,000 to 4,000 hectares in three or four years. In terms of culture and education, there is a primary school, a mobile film team, a store, a canteen, a health station, and a veterinary station. A settlement of the commune has been formed here. What is particularly gratifying to us is that at the welcoming meeting for our delegation, the cooperative officially announced that it would be renamed the Mongolia-China Friendship Pastoral Cooperative. This is the glory of the Chinese people and a manifestation of the deep friendship between China and Mongolia. The cooperative held a wonderful children's horse race to welcome the delegation. The joyful scene of male and female spectators riding steeds and wearing beautiful clothes made us feel very happy. The Bornuur State Farm is 110 kilometers away from Ulaanbaatar. The farm has a total of 50,000 hectares of land, with two units for growing grain and vegetables, each with four production teams. There is a machinery repair plant and a logging team. There are also nurseries and kindergartens. In 1958, more than 4,000 hectares of land were planted, and each hectare harvested 9 quintals of wheat. In 1958, there were more than 400 dairy cows, each milking more than 400 liters. This year, each hectare can harvest 10 quintals of wheat and 18 tons of vegetables. Each dairy cow can milk up to 600 liters. This is a great achievement. We saw with our own eyes the wheat that was about to ripen, with stalks reaching the waist and large grains. It is extremely exciting to see such good crops growing on the cold grassland. At the farm, we saw Chinese and Mongolian workers working closely together, and the flowers of friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people are blooming everywhere.

We visited the Sükhbaatar Choibalsan Museum and the Central Museum. We saw the heroic deeds of the Mongolian people leading a heroic revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Mongolian people's leaders, Sükhbaatar and Choibalsan. They not only overthrew the domestic feudal rule, but also made great contributions to defeating the powerful enemy—Japanese imperialism. In the museum, we also saw the Mongolian people's careful collection and research of scientific culture, historical relics. Mongolia is rich in underground minerals, and the forest area is also very large. We believe that under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the hard work of the Mongolian people, these underground and above-ground wealth will be gradually developed, which will further enhance the socialist economic strength of the Mongolian People's Republic.

Another thing worth reporting is that Comrade Kui Bi, a member of the delegation, received a graduation certificate from the Mongolian Senior Party School. Comrade Kui Bi graduated from the school thirty years ago. Thirty years later, he returned to his alma mater to receive a graduation certificate, which is the highest reward for his thirty years of revolutionary struggle. This was a very moving scene. We know that the Mongolian Senior Party School has not only trained cadres in various fields for the Mongolian People's Republic, but has also trained a group of cadres for the Communist Party of China in history.

The Mongolian people have a great spirit of internationalism. Their enthusiastic welcome and meticulous care for the delegation is a manifestation of the deep friendship with the Chinese people. As long as the delegation appeared on the street, Mongolian men, women, old and young waved to us to show their respect, which made us feel very cordial. When we left Ulaanbaatar, many citizens spontaneously ran to the station to say goodbye to the delegation. This deep affection will remain in our minds for a long time.

The delegation visited the Mongolian People's Republic entrusted by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Through this visit, we firmly believe that it will further deepen the mutual understanding between the two peoples and enhance the deep friendship between the two peoples.

    全国人民代表大会代表团访问蒙古人民共和国的报告
    一九五九年十一月二十七日在第二届全国人民代表大会常务委员会第十一次会议上
    全国人民代表大会代表团团长  林伯渠主席、各位委员：
    全国人民代表大会代表团到蒙古人民共和国进行了友好访问，8月26日出国，9月5日回国。代表团一进蒙古人民共和国的边境——扎门乌德车站，就受到蒙古人民共和国部长会议副主席拉姆苏伦和东戈壁省党政负责同志的欢迎，并在车站上举行了热烈的群众欢迎会。8月28日上午十一时代表团到达乌兰巴托，蒙古人民共和国人民革命党中央委员会第二书记曾德、代理部长会议主席莫洛姆扎木茨、大人民呼拉尔主席贾尔卡赛汗等党政负责同志在车站上迎接，并举行了盛大的群众欢迎会。这种隆重的迎接表明了蒙古人民共和国对我国人大代表团访问的重视和中蒙友谊的深厚，代表团全体同志深受感动。
    在访问期间，蒙古人民共和国大人民呼拉尔主席团主席桑布和曾德、莫洛姆扎木茨、贾尔卡赛汗等党政负责同志接见了代表团全体同志，进行了亲切的交谈。他们对中国人民十年来的建设成就，特别自1958年以来在工农业生产上的大跃进和农村人民公社化，都有很高的评价，把中国的成就看成是他们自己的成就。他们完全同意中共八届八中全会决议，认为是一个总结大跃进经验、继续跃进的重要决议。他们十分珍贵中蒙两国人民的深厚友谊，在谈话中一再提到中国对于蒙古人民的帮助。为了庆祝我国建国十周年，他们决定在全国进行十五天中蒙友谊活动。
    我们看到蒙古人民共和国人民正在为实现三年计划而进行着不懈的努力。工农牧业的生产已经取得了很大的成就。现在全国共有牲畜二千三百余万头，全国每人平均二十七头。农牧业合作化已经完成了，这是一个伟大的胜利。农业方面有了很大的发展，播种面积已达十五万三千公顷，今年还计划开荒十二万公顷，到1961年可以作到面粉全部自给。工业方面，有食品工业、皮革加工业、建筑工业、纺织工业、电力工业及采矿工业等等。随着工业的发展，蒙古工人阶级的队伍增长了，现在职工人数已达十万人以上。文化教育方面，蒙古人民共和国已经建立了完整的教育系统，培养了三千五百多名高级知识分子和一万三千多名中等知识分子。目前全国每六个人中有一个人在学校学习。全国已经基本上消灭了文盲，普及了小学义务教育。
    我们了解了蒙古人民共和国大人民呼拉尔和国家行政机构的一些工作情况。第三届大人民呼拉尔于1957年6月16日由公民选举产生，参加投票的人数共计五十万零九千四百九十七人，占全部选民的99.99％，其中99.98％的选民投票选举了党与非党联盟的候选人，选出代表二百三十三人。代表中工人（包括农业工人）占21.5％，牧民占32.3％，知识分子和干部占46.2％，这充分地说明了大人民呼拉尔实现了最广泛的民主。行政机构的基层单位是县（取消了乡一级），县、社已经合一，县长也就是合作社长，这样既能精简人员，又能加强工作效率，加强对生产的领导，是一种很好的组织形式。
    我们在乌兰巴托市参观了乳品加工厂和乔巴山工业联合工厂。乳品加工厂在1957年由苏联帮助兴建，自1958年底建成投入生产，设备全新，电气化和自动化程度很高。按设计能力一天加工三十吨、一年加工一万吨奶制品，生产十四种奶品。该厂生产定员二百四十余名，在外地设有八个鲜奶收购站。在参观时他们以鲜美的奶制品招待我们，非常可口。乔巴山工业联合工厂是1931年在苏联帮助下兴建的，至1934年建成投入生产，是蒙古最早的一座现代化联合工厂，职工二千三百多名。设有制革、皮衣、皮箱、毡靴、毡子、纺织、制靴等车间。今年已经扩建一个毛纺厂，年产一百一十九万码毛料、十万条毛毡，生产三年，全国每人平均即有一套毛料衣服；正在扩建一个年产一百二十万张精制羊皮的揉皮厂和年产一百二十万双鞋子的皮鞋厂，这两个厂全部建成投入生产以后，产品除供全国人民的日常需要外，还将大量出口。
    我们在乌兰巴托郊外参观了一个牧业合作社、一个国营农场。巴彦朝克特牧业合作社离乌兰巴托七十公里。该社社长巴拉木同志原是副省长，是1956年下放的干部。全社九百二十三户，三千二百一十八人，社员一千七百余人，劳动力一千二百余个，每个劳动日可以收入六个图格里克（两个图格里克折合人民币一元），对于丧失劳动力的鳏寡孤独都有社会保险，生活能够保证。社有牲畜五万四千多头，社员自留牲畜二万二千多头。该社非常重视农业，今年种了二百多公顷燕麦，二十多公顷豌豆，一百五十公顷小麦，小麦种植面积准备在三、四年内扩大到三千至四千公顷。在文化教育方面，有小学一所，有流动电影队、商店、食堂，有医疗站、兽医站，在这里已经形成了一个社的定居点。值得我们特别高兴的是在欢迎我们代表团的大会上，该社正式宣布改名为蒙中友谊牧业合作社。这是中国人民的光荣，也是中蒙深厚友谊的表现。该社为欢迎代表团举行了精彩的儿童赛马会，骑着骏马穿着漂亮服装的男女观众的欢乐情景，使我们感到很大的愉快。鲍尔诺尔国营农场离乌兰巴托一百一十公里。该场共有五万公顷土地，有种粮种菜两个单位，每个单位各有四个生产队。有机械修配厂、林木采伐队。另有托儿所、幼儿园。1958年种了四千多公顷土地，每公顷收获小麦九公石。1958年有乳牛四百多头，每头挤奶四百多公升。今年每公顷可打小麦十公石，可收蔬菜十八吨。乳牛每头挤奶可达六百公升。这是很大的成绩。我们亲眼看到快要成熟的小麦，麦秆及腰，麦粒肥大。在寒冷的草原上长出这样好的庄稼，使人感到极大的兴奋。在农场里我们看到中国工人和蒙古工人亲密地在一起工作，中蒙人民的友谊花朵，处处开放着。
    我们参观了苏赫巴托尔乔巴山博物馆和中央博物馆，我们看到英雄的蒙古人民在蒙古人民领袖苏赫巴托尔和乔巴山同志领导下进行英勇革命斗争的事迹。他们不仅推翻了国内的封建统治，而且对打倒强大的敌人——日本帝国主义，作出了很大的贡献。在博物馆中我们也看到蒙古人民对科学文化、历史文物的细心搜集和研究。蒙古的地下矿藏是丰富的，森林的面积也是很大的。我们相信，在蒙古人民革命党的领导和蒙古人民的辛勤劳动下，这些地下和地上的财富将被逐渐开发，将进一步增强蒙古人民共和国的社会主义经济力量。
    值得报告的另一件事情，是代表团团员奎璧同志在蒙古高级党校接受了一个毕业证书。奎璧同志是三十年前在该校毕业的，三十年后回到母校接受毕业证书，这对他是三十年革命斗争考验的最高奖励。这是一个十分感人的场面。我们知道，蒙古高级党校不仅为蒙古人民共和国培养了各方面的干部，而且在历史上也曾经为中国共产党培养了一批干部。
    蒙古人民具有伟大的国际主义精神，他们对代表团热情洋溢的欢迎和无微不至的照顾，是对中国人民深厚友谊的表示。代表团只要一在街头出现，蒙古的男女老幼都向我们挥手致意，我们感到十分亲切。我们离开乌兰巴托的时候，许多市民自动跑到车站上和代表团告别，这种深情厚意，长久地留在我们脑海里。
    代表团受全国人民代表大会常务委员会的委派访问了蒙古人民共和国。通过这次访问，我们深信必将进一步加深两国人民的相互了解，增进两国人民的深厚友谊。
