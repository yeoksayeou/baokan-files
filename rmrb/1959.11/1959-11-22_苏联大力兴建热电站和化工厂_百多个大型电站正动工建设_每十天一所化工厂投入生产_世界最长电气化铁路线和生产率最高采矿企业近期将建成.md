Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st: According to Soviet newspapers, during the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965), the Soviet Union will, on average, have a new or reconstructed chemical industrial enterprise built and put into production every ten days. This will allow the chemical industry to develop at a faster rate than other industrial sectors.

According to the plan, in 1965, the total output value of the Soviet chemical industry will increase by approximately two times compared to last year, with a growth rate exceeding all other industrial sectors. In the first nine months of this year, the total output value of the chemical industry and rubber industry has already increased by 10% compared to the same period last year, and chemical industrial equipment (in terms of output value) has increased by 49%. According to the Soviet plan for developing the economy, in 1960, the total output value of the entire Soviet industry will increase by 8.1%, while the total output value of the chemical industry will increase by 10%; among them, the production of chemical fibers and plastics will increase by 17%-20%.

In 1960, Soviet investment in capital construction for developing the chemical industry will be more than 30% higher than this year, and 1.3 times more than last year. The growth rate of capital construction investment in the chemical industry is also higher than the growth rate of capital construction investment in the entire national economy and the growth rate in other industrial sectors in this regard. Due to the accelerated progress of capital construction, new chemical industrial enterprises such as the Kuibyshev and Omsk artificial rubber factories, and the Kursk and Ryazan artificial fiber factories will be completed and put into production in 1960. In addition, a number of new workshops will also begin production in some expanding chemical industrial enterprises in Siberia.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th: TASS, Moscow, 18th: A TASS reporter learned from the All-Soviet Thermal Power Station Design Institute that the Soviet Union is currently building and renovating one hundred and fifty large thermal power stations, and is designing forty-eight thermal power stations with a power generation capacity of 50,000 to 300,000 kilowatts.

In the Soviet Union, the combined production of electricity and heat energy is of great significance. Compared with other sources of heat energy production, thermal power stations can greatly save fuel, and the cost of electricity production is also relatively cheap. Currently, the power generation capacity of thermal power stations accounts for approximately one-third of the power generation capacity of the entire Soviet Union's thermal power generation system.

In thermal power stations, gas is rapidly replacing coal as fuel. The widespread use of gas as fuel helps to improve the economic indicators of thermal power stations. When using gas, the effective coefficient of boilers can increase by approximately 15% and reach 90%.

By 1965, natural gas will account for one-third of all fuel used in thermal power stations.

According to the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965), the heat energy production of thermal power stations will almost double, and the electricity will increase by approximately one time.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st: According to a TASS reporter from the Soviet State Planning Committee, the Moscow-Irkutsk (in Siberia) section of the Siberian Railway is expected to be fully electrified in the first half of 1960. This railway line (including the already electrified section) is 5,300 kilometers long, and after being fully electrified, it will become the longest electrified railway in the world. It is twice as long as the current longest electrified railway in the world, which traverses North America.

The Moscow-Irkutsk railway line connects central Soviet Union with Eastern Siberia. When it is fully electrified, people traveling from China to the Soviet Union can transfer to trains pulled by electric locomotives from Irkutsk, and reach Moscow in a shorter time than before.

The Siberian Railway nearly traverses the entire Soviet territory, and it is the busiest railway line in the entire Soviet Union. On this railway line, trains continuously transport materials for factories and large power stations under construction to the east, while also transporting millions of tons of coal, wheat from newly reclaimed areas, timber, and non-ferrous metals produced in Siberia to the central regions of the Soviet Union. After this major railway artery is electrified, it will greatly increase its throughput capacity.

Currently, the length of electrified railway lines in the Soviet Union has reached more than 11,000 kilometers, ranking first in the world. Since the beginning of this year, approximately 2,000 kilometers of railway lines have been converted to electrified lines, and another 2,150 kilometers of railway lines will be electrified in 1960.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th: The Krivoy Rog iron ore region in the Ukrainian Republic of the Soviet Union is building a mining and beneficiation combined enterprise with the highest productivity in the world, which can mine and process 28 million tons of lean iron ore annually.

The original design capacity of this giant mining and beneficiation combined enterprise was to produce tens of millions of tons per year. After the engineering design was revised, its production capacity almost doubled. The funds required to increase this production capacity are fourteen-fifteenths less than building a new enterprise.

This combined enterprise will beneficiate ores containing many iron oxides, which is still the first time in the Soviet Union. In the past, these ores were discarded into waste piles.

Mining operations will be fully mechanized at the two large mining sites of the combined enterprise. The combined enterprise will be operated by a dispatching station.

It has been previously reported that a total of five large-scale mining and beneficiation combined enterprises will be built in the Krivoy Rog iron ore region during the Seven-Year Plan, of which the New Krivoy Rog mining and beneficiation combined enterprise has been completed and put into production in early November, with an annual production capacity of 4.5 million tons.

    苏联大力兴建热电站和化工厂  百多个大型电站正动工建设
  　每十天一所化工厂投入生产
    世界最长电气化铁路线和生产率最高采矿企业近期将建成
    新华社莫斯科21日电　据苏联报纸报道：在七年计划（1959—1965年）期间，苏联平均每十天就将有一座新的或者经过改建的化学工业企业建成和投入生产。这将使化学工业以比其它工业部门更快的速度发展。
    根据计划，1965年苏联化学工业总产值将比去年增加约二倍，增长速度之快超过其他所有工业部门，在今年头九个月中，化学工业和橡胶工业的总产值已比去年同期增加了10％，化学工业设备（按产值计算）已增加49％。根据苏联发展经济的计划，1960年，苏联整个工业的总产值将增加8.1％，而化学工业总产值则将增加10％；其中化学纤维和塑料的产量将增加17％—20％。
    1960年，苏联用于发展化学工业的基本建设投资将比今年多30％以上，比去年则多一点三倍。化学工业基本建设投资的增长率也高于整个国民经济基本建设投资的增长率和其他工业部门这方面的增长率。由于加速进行基本建设，1960年，古比雪夫和鄂木斯克人造橡胶工厂、库尔斯克和梁赞人造纤维工厂等新的化学工业企业将建成和投入生产。此外，在西伯利亚的一些正在扩建的化学工业企业中，还将有一批新的车间开工生产。
    新华社莫斯科18日电　据塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：塔斯社记者从全苏火电站设计院获悉：目前，苏联正在新建和改建一百五十个大型热电站，并且正在设计四十八个发电能力为五万到三十万瓩的热电站。
    在苏联，发展电能和热能的联合生产，具有重大的意义。同热能生产的其他来源比较，热电站可以大大地节省燃料，它的电力的生产成本也比较便宜。目前，热电站的发电能力约占全苏联火力发电系统的发电能力的三分之一。
    在热电站中，瓦斯正在迅速地代替煤作燃料。而广泛采用瓦斯作燃料，有助于提高热电站的经济指标。而使用瓦斯时，锅炉的有效系数可以增加大约15％，而达到90％。
    到1965年，在火电站所使用的全部燃料中，有三分之一将是天然瓦斯。
    根据七年计划（1959年—1965年），热电站的热能生产几乎将增加两倍，而电力将增加约一倍。
    新华社莫斯科21日电　据塔斯社记者从苏联国家计划委员会获悉，西伯利亚大铁路莫斯科—伊尔库次克（在西伯利亚）段，预计在1960年上半年就可以全部电气化。这段铁路线（连现在已经电气化的部分）长五千三百公里，它在全部电气化以后将成为世界上最长的电气化铁路。它比目前世界上最长的、横贯北美的一条电气化铁路长一倍。
    莫斯科—伊尔库次克铁路线把苏联中部和东西伯利亚连结起来。当它全部电气化以后，从中国到苏联去的人就可以从伊尔库次克起改乘用电气机车牵引的列车，以比过去更短的时间到达莫斯科。
    西伯利亚大铁路差不多横贯整个苏联国土，它是全苏联运输最繁忙的铁路线。在这条铁路线上，一列列火车把正在建设中的工厂和大型发电站用的材料源源不断地运往东部，同时又把西伯利亚出产的数以百万吨计的煤，新开垦地区出产的小麦、木材、有色金属等运到苏联中部地区。这一大铁路干线电气化以后，将可以大大提高它的通过能力。
    目前，苏联电气化铁路线的长度已达一万一千公里以上，居世界第一位。今年以来，改为电气化的铁路线约有两千公里，1960年还将有两千一百五十公里铁路线电气化。
    新华社莫斯科20日电　苏联乌克兰共和国克里沃罗格铁矿区正在建设一座世界上生产率最高的采矿选矿联合企业，它每年可以开采和选二千八百万吨贫铁矿。
    这座巨型采矿选矿联合企业原来的设计能力为年产一千几百万吨，经过修改工程设计，它的生产能力几乎增加一倍。增加这些生产能力所需的资金比建设一座新企业要少十五分之十四。
    这座联合企业将选含有许多氧化铁的矿石，这在苏联还是第一次。而过去，这些矿石都被抛到废矿堆去。
    在联合企业的两处大型采矿场上，采矿工作将完全机械化。联合企业将由一个调度台来操纵。
    前已报道，克里沃罗格铁矿区在七年计划期间总共将建成五座大规模的采矿选矿联合企业，其中的新克里沃罗格采矿选矿联合企业已在11月初建成和投入生产，它的年生产能力为四百五十万吨。图为电气机车在新西伯利亚—泰加线上行驶。
