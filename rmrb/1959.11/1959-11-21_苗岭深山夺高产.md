    Achieving High Yields in the Deep Mountains of Miao Territory
    In the deep mountains of Miao territory, where the mountains are high and the water is cold, how much unhusked rice can be harvested per mu of paddy field? Ten years ago, it was only one or two hundred jin. After liberation, the yield has soared like a kite with a broken string, reaching thousands of jin per mu in some places.
    This spring, Zhang Xuchao and the twenty-four young men and women of the Youth Production Team, responding to the call of the county party committee, resolutely implemented the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture and set ambitious goals. The paddy fields in this area are mostly acidic soil. The entire team, in one go, carried all the fertile mud from the sides of villages, ponds, shady ditches, and toilets, spreading a layer of black fertile mud on all the fields, so that the base fertilizer reached more than 15,000 jin per mu; and resolutely implemented rational close planting. At the time, some old farmers said: "Look at how densely you've planted, like cattle hair, later you'll have good grass to pad the cattle pen!" Some people even went to the commune to complain, wanting them to pull it up and replant. But these young people had other plans. They said: "Since it's an experiment, we can't be afraid of failure, and besides, we're not just messing around." The Party organization enthusiastically supported their opinion. In the summer, they promptly prevented pests and, during the severe drought, insisted on fighting the drought to ensure that the water in the fields did not dry up. Sweat finally led to a bumper harvest, creating a high-yield record. (Liu Dao)

    苗岭深山夺高产
    在山高水冷的苗岭深山里，一亩水稻能收多少谷子呢？十年前只不过一两百斤。解放后，产量像断了线的风筝——步步高升，有的达到了亩产千斤。
    今年春天，张绪超和青年生产队的二十四名男女青年，响应县委的号召，坚决贯彻农业“八字宪法”，立下了雄心大志。这一带地方的稻田多是酸性土壤，全队一鼓作气，把寨边、塘边、阴沟、厕所边的肥泥全挑光了，给所有的田铺上一层黑肥泥，使每亩底肥达到一万五千多斤；坚决执行了合理密植。当时有些老农民说：“看你们栽的像牛毛一样，以后有好草垫牛圈啦！”甚至有人到公社提意见，要他们扯了重栽。但是这些青年们却另有打算，他们说：“既然是试验就不能怕失败，何况我们又不是乱搞。”党组织热情地支持了他们的意见。夏季，他们及时预防虫害；在大旱期间，坚持抗旱，保证田里水不干。流汗终于夺得了丰收，创造了高产纪录。　（刘岛）
