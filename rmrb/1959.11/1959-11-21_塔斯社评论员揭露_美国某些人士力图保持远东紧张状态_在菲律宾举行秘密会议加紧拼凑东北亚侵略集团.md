Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th - TASS commentator Kharkov writes: A secret meeting was recently held in Baguio, Philippines, convened by U.S. Pacific Area Armed Forces Commander Felt at the U.S. resort "John Hay." Although the meeting was held in secret, it is known that representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, headed by "Chief of Staff" Peng Meng-chi, attended. The "Manila Chronicle" confirmed that Philippine Armed Forces Chief of Staff Cabal also attended the meeting.

According to the Japanese "Akahata" newspaper, representatives of the Japanese armed forces, including Joint Staff Council Chairman Keizo Hayashi, also attended the "John Hay" meeting.

Also noteworthy is a message from Manila radio, stating that Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Secretary-General Sarasin was in the Philippines at the same time as the secret military meeting, meeting with the Philippine Foreign Minister and other officials. It seems that Sarasin had a direct connection with the "John Hay" meeting, attending as a special envoy of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

There can be no doubt that this meeting is connected with expanding war preparations in the Western Pacific. It is known that the United States has long formulated plans to establish a military bloc in this region. They gave it a corresponding name – the Northeast Asia Treaty Organization, meaning a Northeast Asian military bloc composed of Japan, the Syngman Rhee clique, Chiang Kai-shek elements, and the Philippines. The Philippines plays the role of a link between the Northeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asian military bloc – the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization – just as Pakistan is the link between the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization.

It must be pointed out that the activity of piecing together the Northeast Asia Treaty Organization has gained new impetus due to negotiations on revising the so-called U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." In this regard, the remarks of Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama on November 16 at the Senate Budget Committee meeting are noteworthy. According to Japanese radio broadcasts, Fujiyama admitted that, according to the new treaty draft, U.S. armed forces stationed in Japan could "take combat actions in the Far East region." He explained that the so-called "Far East region" refers to "the area north of the Philippines, including the Chinese mainland coast, the Soviet Maritime Territory, and other areas surrounding Japan." Subsequently, he also said that Japanese troops could "pursue the enemy," which can actually be interpreted as meaning that Japanese troops could go abroad. No wonder Japanese newspapers issued anxious cries, saying that such plans harbor extremely serious dangers, with the possibility of dragging Japan into conflicts that have no direct relation to it. We should point out in passing that the aforementioned region mentioned by Fujiyama is consistent with the scope of activities of the proposed Northeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The "John Hay" meeting was held to the accompaniment of missile military exercises conducted by the U.S. military on Okinawa. This is the first missile firing organized by the U.S. military outside the United States. At the same time, warships of the U.S. Seventh Fleet recently conducted military exercises off the coast of the Philippines. Showing strength during the secret military meeting further illustrates the sinister nature of that military bloc under the name of the Northeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The positive changes currently appearing in the international situation are clearly not to the liking of certain people in the United States. Therefore, they are attempting to obstruct the thaw in the Far East, trying to keep the region in a state of tension, stubbornly clinging to the idea of military blocs.

    塔斯社评论员揭露
    美国某些人士力图保持远东紧张状态
    在菲律宾举行秘密会议加紧拼凑东北亚侵略集团
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科19日讯：塔斯社评论员哈尔科夫写道：最近在菲律宾的碧瑶举行了一次秘密会议，这次会议是由美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特在美国避暑地“约翰黑营”召集的。尽管会议是秘密进行的，但是大家仍然知道了出席会议的有以“参谋总长”彭孟缉为首的蒋介石集团的代表。据“马尼拉纪事报”证实，菲律宾武装部队参谋长卡巴尔也参加了会议。
    据日本“赤旗报”报道，出席“约翰黑营”会议的还有日本武装部队的代表，其中包括幕僚长联席会议议长林敬三。
    耐人寻味的还有马尼拉电台的一条消息，其中说，在举行军人秘密会议的同时，东南亚条约组织的秘书长沙拉信正在菲律宾，同菲律宾的外交部长以及其他官方人士会晤。看来，沙拉信同“约翰黑营”的会晤有直接的关系，他是作为东南亚条约组织的特使到那里去的。
    可以毫不怀疑的是，这次会议同扩大太平洋西部的备战活动是有联系的。大家知道，美国早就制定出在这个地区建立军事集团的计划。他们给它起了一个相应的名字——东北亚条约组织，这就是说，它是由日本、李承晚集团、蒋介石分子和菲律宾组成的东北亚军事集团。菲律宾在这里扮演着东北亚条约组织和东南亚军事集团——东南亚条约组织之间的联系环节的角色，正像巴基斯坦是东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织的联系环节一样。
    必须指出，由于修改所谓美日“安全条约”的谈判，拼凑东北亚条约组织的活动获得了新的推动力。在这方面，值得注意的是日本外务相藤山爱一郎11月16日在参议院预算委员会会议上的讲话。据日本电台广播，藤山承认，根据新条约草案，驻扎日本的美国武装部队可以“在远东地区采取战斗行动”，他解释道，所谓“远东地区”是指“菲律宾以北的地区，包括中国大陆沿岸、苏联滨海边疆区和日本周围的其他地区”。随后，他还说，日本军队可以“追击敌人”，这实际上可以这样来解释，即日本军队可以出国。难怪日本报纸发出忧虑的呼声，说这类计划孕育着极其严重的危险，即有可能把日本卷入跟它没有直接关系的冲突中去。我们要顺便指出，藤山所提到的上述地区同拟议中的东北亚条约组织的活动范围是一致的。
    “约翰黑营”会议是在美军在冲绳岛举行导弹军事演习的伴奏下举行的。这是美军在美国国外组织的第一次导弹射击。与此同时，美国第七舰队的军舰最近在菲律宾沿岸举行了军事演习。在举行秘密军事会议的期间显示实力，这更加说明了以东北亚条约组织为名的那个军事集团的不祥性质。
    目前在国际局势中出现的良好变化显然是美国某些人士所不喜欢的。因此，他们企图阻挠远东的解冻，力图把这一地区保持在紧张状态中，顽固地抱着军事集团的念头不放。
