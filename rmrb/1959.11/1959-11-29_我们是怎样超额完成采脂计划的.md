    How We Overfulfilled the Resin Tapping Plan
    Xinxing People's Commune, Nanxiong County
    Under the correct leadership of the Party, the Xinxing People's Commune in Nanxiong County, Guangdong Province, holding high the red flag of the General Line and giving full play to the superiority of the commune, organized more than 1,600 people to go to the mountains to vigorously promote the resin tapping production campaign, setting off a high tide of resin tapping, which made the rosin output rise sharply. According to the statistics as of November 20, a total of 761.5 tons of rosin were produced, accounting for 117% of the annual task assigned by the county party committee, exceeding the target by more than 100 tons. At present, resin tapping production continues to rise, with an average daily output of five tons, and a maximum of 12.5 tons. It is estimated that another 50 to 100 tons of rosin can be produced by the end of the year.

    The Xinxing Commune was able to complete the annual resin tapping task ahead of schedule and over fulfill it mainly by adopting the following measures:
      (1) Putting politics in command, greatly encouraging revolutionary drive, and launching a high-efficiency movement. From the commune party committee to the brigade party branch, the first secretary took the lead and grasped this work. Both the management area and the brigade had a director and a brigade leader specifically in charge of this production. A total of 95 full-time cadres were drawn from the commune, achieving "cadres on every mountain, leaders everywhere." At the same time, the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee was implemented, vigorously criticizing the right-leaning conservative ideas that "rosin production is highly technical and cannot increase output" and "steep mountains and scattered trees cannot greatly encourage drive," and launching a "everyone strives to be a resin tapping expert" high-efficiency movement. This made production rise sharply. According to statistics in September, 211 people reached a monthly output of 300 catties; 96 people reached 400 to 500 catties; 72 people reached 600 to 800 catties; and 64 people reached 800 to 1,000 catties.
      (2) Implementing the policy of walking on two legs, vigorously carrying out mass movements, and implementing both commune resin tapping and brigade resin tapping, combining the organization of professional teams for year-round resin tapping with mass resin tapping. The commune party committee grasped the commune-owned year-round resin tapping team with one hand and the mass movement of brigade shock resin tapping with the other. Among the more than 1,600 resin tappers in the commune, 981 were in the brigade shock resin tapping team; the commune-owned professional team, which accounted for 60% of the total number of people, was a fixed labor force engaged in resin tapping production throughout the year. Experience here proves that adopting the policy of walking on two legs is one of the keys to completing the resin tapping task. In the first half of the year, we only had more than 400 people in the commune-owned year-round resin tapping team. Because we did not carry out a mass shock resin tapping movement, we only completed 225 tons of resin tapping by the end of June, accounting for 34.6% of the plan; while from July, after vigorously carrying out the mass movement, we produced more than 536 tons of resin in the past four months, accounting for 82.5% of the plan.
      (3) Strengthening technical guidance, carrying out technical innovation, and actively cultivating new resin tappers to make production develop in a balanced way. The commune drew 12 resin tapping technicians to go to the mountains in separate areas to contract to teach new workers to pass the technical barrier. In order to summarize experience and promote it in an all-round way, the commune has successively organized more than 200 new people in four batches to hold on-site meetings in Luoba, to learn technology on the spot and to observe the advanced resin tapping method of Zhong Huanqi, a national resin tapping expert, who cut 2,000 trees a day and produced 268 catties of resin. We also created experience by vigorously carrying out experimental fields and achieving results. We also adopted the method of old hands leading new hands, constantly improving the technical proficiency of new hands, so that the technical level of more than 800 new hands in the commune has been improved to varying degrees.
    In order to increase production and maintain production, chemical resin tapping is fully used to implement winter resin tapping. All of the more than 1,600 people who go to the mountains to tap resin have now used the chemical resin tapping method.
    (4) Strengthening quota management, implementing "four fixings" to individuals, and establishing a strict system of rewards and punishments. The four fixings are: "fixing time, fixing tasks, fixing work point remuneration, and fixing rewards and punishments." The specific method of the four fixings is: according to the strength of labor, the level of technology, and the distance of the area, implement setting grades by person, setting quantities by grade, and recording work points by quantity. There are also specific provisions in terms of rewards and punishments: those who complete more than 90% of the task will not be rewarded or punished, those who complete 80% of the task will be criticized at the meeting, and those who complete less than 80% of the task will have 20-50% of their work points deducted, or other appropriate measures will be taken; those who over fulfill the task will return 40% of the overfilled part to the individual, and 60% will be returned to the team as a reward.

    我们是怎样超额完成采脂计划的
    南雄县始兴人民公社
    广东省南雄县始兴人民公社在党的正确领导下，高举总路线红旗，发挥了公社优越性，组织了一千六百多人上山大搞采脂生产运动，掀起了采脂高潮，使松脂产量直线上升，到11月20日的统计，共产松脂七百六十一吨半，占县委分配的全年任务的117％，超产一百多吨。现在采脂生产持续上升，日产量平均已达五吨，最高达到十二吨半。预计到年底还能再产松脂五十吨到一百吨。
    始兴公社能够提前超额完成全年采脂任务，主要采取了如下几条措施：
      （一）政治挂帅，大鼓革命干劲，开展高工效运动。由公社党委到大队党支部都是第一书记挂帅，掌握这项工作，管理区和大队都有一个主任和大队长专抓这项生产。全社共抽专职干部九十五人，做到了“山山有骨干，处处有领导”。同时贯彻八届八中全会决议，大力批判了“松香生产技术性强，不能提高产量”“山陡树散不能大鼓干劲”的右倾保守思想，并开展了“人人争做采脂能手”的高工效运动。这样就使生产直线上升，据9月份统计，达到月产三百斤的，有二百一十一人；达到四百斤至五百斤的，有九十六人；六百斤到八百斤的，有七十二人；八百到一千斤的，有六十四人。
      （二）贯彻两条腿走路方针，大搞群众运动，实行公社采脂与大队采脂并举，组织专业队长年采脂和群众采脂相结合。公社党委一手抓社属长年采脂队，一手抓大队突击采脂的群众运动，全社一千六百多名香农中有九百八十一名是大队突击采脂队；占总人数60％的社属专业队，系全年从事采脂生产的固定劳动力。这里的经验证明，采用两条腿走路方针，是完成采脂任务的关键之一。上半年我们只有社属长年采脂队四百多人，由于没有搞群众突击采脂运动，到6月底只完成二百二十五吨采脂任务，占计划的34.6％；而从7月份大搞群众运动以后，到目前四个多月，就产脂五百三十六吨多，占计划82.5％。
      （三）加强技术指导，开展技术革新，积极培养采脂新手，使生产平衡发展。全社抽出了十二名采脂技工分片到山上去包干教新工人过好技术关。为了总结经验全面推广，公社曾先后组织了新手二百多人分四批在罗坝召开现场会议，实地学习技术并观摩了全国采脂能手钟焕其日刈二千株、产脂二百六十八斤的先进采脂方法。我们并通过大搞试验田，做出成绩，创造经验。我们还采用了老手带新手的方法，不断提高新手的技术熟练程度，因而使全社八百多名新手的技术水平，都有不同程度地提高。
    为了提高产量和坚持生产，全面使用化学采脂，实行冬季采脂。现在上山采脂的一千六百多人，已经全部使用了化学采脂的方法。
    （四）加强定额管理，实行“四定”到人，建立奖罚严明制度。四定即：“定时间、定任务、定工分报酬、定奖罚”。四定的具体做法是：按劳力强弱、技术高低、地区远近，实行按人定等、按等定量、按量记工分。在奖、罚方面也有具体的规定：完成任务达90％以上者不奖不罚，完成任务在80％者大会批评，完成任务在80％以下者扣除工分20—50％，或另作其它适当处理；超额完成任务者，则将超额部分的40％归个人，60％归队作为奖励。
