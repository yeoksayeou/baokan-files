    Develop the Fiberglass Industry
    Ministry of Construction Proposes Production and Construction Guidelines and Exchanges Experiences

    (Our Newspaper) The Ministry of Construction recently convened a national advanced fiberglass industry on-site conference in Shanghai. The conference summarized the production and construction experiences, clarified the development direction of this new industry, and made provisions on how production management and capital construction work should adapt to the requirements of this industry's standardized production.

    The advanced fiberglass industry is a new industry established in our country during the Great Leap Forward last year. At present, in our country, in addition to the first advanced fiberglass plant—the Shanghai Yaohua Glass Factory—which has completed the first phase of its project and started producing electrical insulation materials, its second phase project will also be completed within this year. In addition, factories are also being built in Harbin and other places.

    This advanced fiberglass is an inorganic fiber, which is different from ordinary alkali-containing fiberglass used as building materials, and also different from organic synthetic fibers such as nylon, capron, and polyvinyl chloride. It has the characteristics of high strength, high insulation, high temperature resistance, moisture resistance, and corrosion resistance. It is the best electrical insulation base material, indispensable for large generators and precision instruments, special miniature motors, and various large and medium-sized dry-type transformers. Manufacturing general motors, using advanced fiberglass as insulation material, can reduce the volume by 25% to 40%, and can save 10% to 50% of copper and silicon steel sheets.

    In order to do a good job in the production and construction of this emerging industry, the conference criticized certain simple and rash attitudes in production management and capital construction. It pointed out that advanced fiberglass production is an industry with strict quality requirements, a wide range of processes, and a broad technical field. Production consumes a lot of precious materials such as gold and borax, as well as electricity and manpower. Therefore, it is necessary to seriously, earnestly, and meticulously do a good job in the production management and construction of the advanced fiberglass industry. In terms of capital construction, it is required to achieve standardization according to the principle of "adopt foreign methods where appropriate, and adopt indigenous methods where appropriate." Quality requirements must be strict, and technical equipment should be mechanized and automated as much as possible. In terms of production management, the production process should be finalized according to the results of the finalized tests, and technical organizational measures should be taken to enable the technical level of production technology management, workers, and technicians to adapt to the requirements of production as soon as possible.

    发展玻璃纤维工业
    建筑工程部提出生产建设方针并交流经验
    本报讯　建筑工程部最近在上海召开了全国高级玻璃纤维工业现场会议，总结了生产和建设的经验，明确了这一门新工业的发展方向，对生产管理和基本建设工作如何适应这门工业正规化生产的要求，作了规定。
    高级玻璃纤维工业是去年大跃进中我国建立起的一门新工业。目前，我国除第一座高级玻璃纤维厂——上海耀华玻璃厂已经完成第一期工程，开始生产电器绝缘材料，它的第二期工程也将在今年年内建成。此外，哈尔滨等地也正在兴建这种工厂。
    这种高级玻璃纤维是一种无机纤维，它不同于作建筑材料用的含碱的普通玻璃纤维，也不同于尼龙、卡普龙、聚氯乙烯等有机合成纤维。它具有高强度、高绝缘、耐高温、耐潮湿、耐腐蚀等特性，是大型发电机和精密仪器配套的特种微型电动机、各种大中型干式变压器等不可缺少的最好的电气绝缘基础材料。制造一般的电机，采用高级玻璃纤维作绝缘材料，体积可以缩小25％至40％，可以节省铜和硅钢片10％至50％。
    为了作好这门新兴工业的生产、建设工作，会议批判了生产管理和基本建设中某些简单轻率的态度。指出高级玻璃纤维生产是一种质量要求严格，工艺范围广，技术领域宽的工业，生产时，消耗的金和硼砂等贵重材料及电力、人力都多。因此必须严肃、认真、细致地作好高级玻璃纤维工业的生产管理与建设工作。在基本建设方面，要求根据“该洋则洋、该土则土”的方针，做到正规化。质量要求要严格，技术装备要尽可能机械化自动化。生产管理方面生产工艺应根据定型试验的成果定型下来，并采取技术组织措施，使生产技术管理、工人和技术人员的技术水平尽快地适应生产的要求。
