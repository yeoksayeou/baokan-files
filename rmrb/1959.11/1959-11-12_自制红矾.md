    Self-Made Red Alum

    In this year's continued Great Leap Forward, our Shanghai Yimin Tannery will use 60% of the raw materials to make 100% of the products. Moreover, we will also solve the problem of red alum, a major tanning material that originally relied on imports, through self-reliance. The workers said with full confidence: "If foreigners can do it, we can definitely do it too," and decided to try making red alum themselves. First, five or six comrades worked on it, then eight or nine comrades worked on it. From using crucibles for burning to using reverberatory furnaces for burning, they succeeded after more than 20 experiments. They also created a set of operating methods in continuous research and innovation, which greatly improved the conversion rate of red alum, reaching a maximum of over 90%. By the end of September, a total of 29.3 tons had been produced. Coal consumption was also reduced by 70%, saving 271 tons of coal in the third quarter.

    自制红矾
    我们上海益民制革厂在今年的继续大跃进中，要用六成的原料做成十成的产品，而且有些原来依赖进口的主要鞣革材料——红矾，我们还要自力更生解决。工人们满怀信心地说：“外国能做，我们也一定能做”，决心自己试造红矾。先是五、六个同志干，后来八、九个同志干，从采用坩埚烧到采用反射炉烧，经过二十多次的试验获得了成功，并且在不断的钻研、不断的革新中创造了一套操作法，大大提高了红矾转化率，最高达到90％以上，到9月底为止共生产了二十九点三吨。还降低了煤耗量70％，第三季度节约用煤二百七十一吨。
