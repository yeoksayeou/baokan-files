    Charming Clay Dolls
    Wang Jiashu
    At the Beijing Municipal Art Exhibition and the National Arts and Crafts Exhibition, a batch of clay dolls attracted visitors. Some people, already with gray hair, had long been alienated from toys—companions of their childhood—but why were they so fascinated by these clay toys again? These small "playthings," only one or two inches in size, are small but full of meaning, possessing an almost magical power of infection, making people laugh and prompting reflection.
    Look at that little doll hugging a peach. It's clearly a child just learning to crawl. Mom put a big peach in front of him. The peach attracted him. He pounced on it, trying to hug it, but he couldn't. You can see that, with the effort, his buttocks and legs are sticking up, like a small gold ingot. The rosy red chubby face, with a red rouge dot between the eyebrows painted by mom, the bright red bib matched with golden bracelets and anklets—all of this complements the lively demeanor and white, plump skin, forming a moving decorative beauty. Just as the author intended, through the traditional Chinese concept of adorable chubby babies and peaches, symbolizing the "fortune" and "longevity" of a good life. This emotion resonated with us.
    And look at that little girl with two braids, holding a red flower in her hand, tilting her head slightly, looking askance, what is she looking at? The two upturned little braids, the thick black "bangs" on her forehead, how adorable! This little girl's head is really big, but her body is so short that it's not even as long as her face. True, there is no such specific child in real life; but this does not affect its authenticity as a toy image in the slightest. On the contrary, the author uses exaggerated cartoon techniques to express what he wants to express, highlighting the beautiful head of the little girl, adding to its unique fantasy color and decorative interest.
    Here, we are reminded of the Czechoslovakian puppet film art that was recently exhibited in Beijing and Shanghai. After seeing those interesting puppet images, before you even have time to think: where are these kinds of images in real life, they attract you with their moving charm and artistic fragrance. This is the power of art! In the Czechoslovakian puppets, the heads of the child figures are just a sphere, the nose is also a small sphere (or there is no nose at all), the eyes are also a pair of black spheres, and sometimes the eyes are separated on the temples—it looks "unrealistic," but the children do not care about these, but love them even more. These images often guide children to roam in the world of imagination and fairy tales.
    The authors of this batch of toys understand child psychology and the role of imagination in art. Life, imagination, and creation are melted into one furnace, deformation, exaggeration, and decoration are unified into a whole, and the style is fresh. This characteristic is present in both the modeling and the color processing. (Unfortunately, due to printing limitations, we cannot introduce in the newspaper the strong, bright color effects dominated by rose red, emerald green, and bright red... which can arouse children's fantasies.) This characteristic is a feature of our traditional art. The "dolls" in folk woodblock New Year paintings, the "Big A Fu" in folk clay sculptures, the clay toys and pottery toys and cloth tigers in the north and south, the pottery figurines unearthed from Han Dynasty tombs and the small animals among them, the pottery ox cart toys in Tang Dynasty tombs in Xi'an... In our excellent folk and national traditional art works, there are many such exemplary examples. The batch of clay toys seen now inherits our ancient and excellent traditions and has new developments. The author has a rich life and artistic imagination, which are condensed in his works. Through the works, children's imagination can be cultivated and continuously improved. Isn't this a successful toy image?
    This batch of toys also reflects many aspects of the new life of the motherland. Therefore, it will plant seeds of good qualities in the young minds of children. For example: the spirit of the Chinese people harnessing dragons and subduing tigers in the Great Leap Forward to build water conservancy projects, the happy life of old grandfathers and grandmothers living in the respect-for-the-elderly homes in the People's Communes, the chef uncles and service staff uncles who make delicious food for us and take care of us, the policemen and "aunties" who care for children, the beautiful dances of the various brotherly ethnic groups in the motherland's big family, the brave and valiant football players in the sports meet... Obviously, this is a gratifying and commendable example for the design of new toys. Some people say that toys are just for children to "play with" and have no meaning. The famous Soviet educator Makarenko once said: "Games are of great significance to children, just as the activities, work and services of adults are of all significance. How children are in games, after growing up, they will mostly perform the same as in games." It can be seen that games are of great significance to our children's education; toys should not only but also can reflect new life and new ideas.
    After seeing these interesting and adorable clay toy works, I imagine this: it is best to use other suitable materials, and ask toy factories to produce them in large quantities and popularize them among children. What a good thing that would be! Let us better cooperate in all aspects to jointly make more toys for children that meet educational and health principles and can awaken children's imagination and beauty! One day, our aestheticians will also talk about the aesthetic problems in children's toys in their discussions.

    迷人的泥娃娃
    王家树
    在北京市美术作品展览会和全国工艺美术展览会上一批泥娃娃吸引住参观的人。有些人已经白发斑斑，早已和玩具——童年时代的伴侣疏远了，可是为什么又这样迷恋于这些泥玩具呢？这些大小只有一、两寸左右的小“玩艺儿”，东西虽小，可是意味无穷，有一种近乎神奇的感染力，使人欢笑，引人思索。
    你看那个搂着桃子的小娃娃，显然是一个刚刚学爬的孩子。妈妈把一个大桃子放在他的面前，桃子吸引了他，一下子扑过来，抱呵，抱呵，抱不动。看得出来，由于用力，屁股和双腿都翘了起来，好像一个小元宝。玫瑰红的胖脸蛋，两眉间妈妈还给点上了一个红胭脂点，大红的兜兜配上金煌煌的手镯、脚镯——这一切，都与那跃跃欲动的神态、白胖的肌肤互相衬托，形成了动人的装饰美。正如作者自己的创作意图那样；通过如中国人民传统的观念那样以可爱的胖娃娃和桃子象征生活美好的“福”与“寿”。这种情感引起了我们的共鸣。
    再看那个梳着两只辫子，手里拿着一枝红花的小姑娘，微微侧着头，斜视着，在看什么呢？两只噘起的小辫子，额上浓黑的“刘海”，多么逗人爱！这个小姑娘的头可真大呀，身子却矮得还没有自己的脸部长。不错，现实生活中是没有这样一个具体的孩子；但这丝毫没有影响它作为一个玩具形象的真实性。相反，作者使用夸张的漫画手法，表现了所要表现的，使小姑娘美丽的头部突出，增加了它所特有的幻想色彩和装饰趣味。
    这里，会使我们想起不久前在北京、上海展出的捷克斯洛伐克木偶电影艺术。看了那些有趣的木偶形象，还没有等你来得及想：现实生活中哪里有这种形象，它们就以动人的魅力和艺术的芳馨把你吸引住了。这正是艺术的力量！捷克斯洛伐克木偶中的孩子形象，脑袋有的只是一个圆球，鼻子也是一个小圆球（或者根本没有鼻子），眼睛也是一对黑圆球，甚至有时候眼睛是分开在鬓角上——看起来是不“真实”的，可是孩子们不但不计较这些，反而更加喜爱它们。这些形象，往往会引导孩子们遨游于想像和童话的世界。
    这批玩具的作者懂得儿童心理和艺术上的想像的作用。生活、想像、创造熔于一炉，变形、夸张、装饰统一于一个整体，格调清新。不论在造型或色彩的处理上，都有这个特点。（可惜限于印刷条件，在报上不能介绍出那种以玫瑰红、石绿、大红……为主调的，强烈鲜明的，能够引起孩子们幻想的色彩效果。）这个特点是我们传统艺术中的特点。民间木板年画中的“娃娃”，民间泥塑中的“大阿福”，南北各地的泥玩具、陶玩具、布老虎，汉代墓葬出土的陶俑和其中的小动物，西安唐墓中的陶牛车玩具……。在我们优秀的民间和民族传统艺术作品中，这样典范的例子多得很。现在看到的这批泥玩具就继承了我们古老的、优良的传统，并且有了新的发展。作者有着丰富的生活和艺术的想像力，这些都凝结在他的作品中。通过作品，又可以培养孩子们的想像力，并不断地提高它。这难道不是成功的玩具形象吗？
    这批玩具还反映了祖国新生活许多方面的面貌。因而它就会在儿童幼小的心灵上种下优良品质的种子。比方：中国人民在大跃进中兴修水利降龙伏虎的气势，在人民公社敬老院过着幸福生活的老爷爷老奶奶，为我们做好吃的、照料我们的厨师伯伯服务员叔叔，爱护儿童的警察、“阿姨”，祖国大家庭各兄弟民族的优美的舞蹈，运动会上健勇的足球运动员……等等。显然，这对新玩具的设计是一个可喜的、值得提倡的榜样。有人说，玩具只是给孩子“玩玩”，没有什么意义。苏联著名的教育家马卡连柯曾经说过：“游戏在儿童中有很重要的意义，就像成年人的活动、工作和服务所有的意义一样。儿童在游戏中如何，长大之后，在工作中也就多半会表现得和游戏中一般无二。”可见游戏对我们的儿童教育是非同小可的；玩具不仅应当而且可以反映新的生活和新的思想。
    看了这些有趣的、逗人爱的泥玩具作品，我这样设想：最好选用其他合适的材料，请玩具厂大量生产，普及到孩子中间去。这该是多么好的一件事！让我们各方面更好地协作起来，共同为孩子们多做些既符合教育、卫生原则，又能够唤起孩子们的想像和美的玩具吧！有那么一天，我们的美学家会在自己的讨论中，也谈谈儿童玩具中的美学问题。
