    Fully Utilize Favorable Conditions to Overcome Unfavorable Factors
    Grain Production in Qinghai's Qaidam Basin Increases by 80%
    (Our Dispatch) China's newly emerging agricultural reclamation base – the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai, has increased its grain production by more than 80% this year compared to last year. The vast majority of farms and communes throughout the region have seen large or small areas of "thousand-jin fields" (a total of more than 20,300 mu of grain with a per-mu yield of over 1,000 jin). In places like Tianjun, Lenghu, and Da Qaidam, grain has also grown for the first time ever, and high yields have been achieved.
    At the end of last year, the CPC Qaidam Working Committee, in summarizing the experiences and lessons of the Great Leap Forward, decided that in order to make agriculture quickly catch up with the industrial development centered on petroleum, it was necessary to put agricultural development on an important agenda. In accordance with this spirit, Party committees at all levels strengthened their leadership over agricultural production, organized mutual assistance and cooperation between farms and communes, and vigorously carried out basic construction such as repairing canals, reclaiming wasteland, accumulating fertilizer, and preparing land, which expanded the planting area of grain crops by more than 40%. Starting from the winter and spring of last year with fertilizer accumulation and deep plowing as the center of preparations for cultivation, Party committees at all levels organized six battles, including spring sowing, seedling inspection and replanting, weeding, preventing lodging, late-stage field management, and autumn harvesting, with each link closely following the next in a series of agricultural activities.
    The favorable conditions for agricultural production in Qaidam are abundant fertilizer sources, good soil quality, and long hours of sunshine; the unfavorable conditions are high altitude and cold, short frost-free periods, and little rain with frequent winds. Under the leadership of the Party, various farms and communes established the idea that "man can conquer nature," fully utilizing favorable conditions and overcoming unfavorable factors. This year, more than 20,000 jin of fertilizer were applied per mu, and generally wheat fields were deep-plowed to about 30 centimeters. On the basis of deep plowing and abundant fertilizer, reasonable close planting was carried out, and field management was strengthened. Qaidam has little rainfall, and now all farmland has canals built, so water can be irrigated according to the needs of crops. Therefore, agricultural production has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. (Yang Liben)

    充分利用有利条件战胜不利因素
    青海柴达木盆地粮食增产八成
    本报讯　我国新兴的农垦基地——青海柴达木盆地，今年粮食比去年增产八成多。全区绝大多数农场和公社都出现了大片或小片的千斤田（共有二万零三百多亩粮食亩产千斤以上）。在天峻、冷湖、大柴旦等地也破天荒地生长出粮食，并且获得高产。
    去年年底，中共柴达木工委在总结大跃进的经验教训时决定，为了使农业迅速赶上以石油为中心的工业发展，必须把发展农业提到重要日程上来。各级党委根据这一精神，加强了对农业生产的领导，组织农场、公社互助协作，大搞修渠、开荒、积肥、整地等基本建设，使粮食作物播种面积扩大了40％多。从去冬今春以积肥和深翻为中心的备耕工作开始，各级党委组织了春播、查苗补苗、除草、防倒伏、后期田间管理、秋收等六次战役，在一系列农事活动中始终一环紧套一环。
    柴达木农业生产的有利条件是肥源多、土质好、日照长；不利条件是地势高寒、无霜期短、少雨多风。各农场和公社在党的领导下，树立了“人定胜天”思想，充分利用有利条件，战胜不利因素。今年每亩施肥两万多斤，一般麦田都深翻三十厘米左右。在深翻多肥的基础上，进行了合理密植，加强了田间管理。柴达木雨水少，现在全部农田都修了水渠，可以根据作物需要浇水。因此，今年农业生产得到空前大丰收。　（杨立本）
