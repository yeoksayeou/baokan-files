    A Person Who Can't Stay Idle
    Going west from the ancient city of Turpan and entering the Wuxing People's Commune, one immediately gets a feeling of harvest. On both sides of the road, cotton fields are full of blossoming buds, grape vines are laden with fruit, and melon vines are covered with strings of tempting melons and fruits. Looking at these abundant crops, you can imagine how outstanding the commune's production work is.
    As the carriage reached the Wuxing People's Commune, we entered a simple courtyard to visit the commune director, Rouzi Tuerdi. A cadre smiled and said, "You won't find him here. His office is everywhere – on the team, in the fields. If you want to find him, wait for him at the canteen early tomorrow morning." In the commune's courtyard, we chatted with this cadre about the commune director's working methods. He told us that Rouzi Tuerdi usually doesn't stay in the office to understand the situation and solve problems. He stays wherever there is a problem to solve it, and participates in work wherever there are difficulties, helping cadres and commune members overcome them. Sometimes he doesn't return to the commune for several days, and sometimes he comes back at night and leaves again at dawn. Everyone calls him a person who can't stay idle. Last month, he heard that the wheat harvest and autumn field management work in the Minzhu Production Team were progressing slowly, so he packed his luggage and went to the team to help with the work. As soon as he arrived at the team, he went to the fields and harvested wheat with the commune members, talking to them while harvesting. When the commune members saw the commune director pick up a sickle and start working, they all reported the problems of the team to him. Old farmers and activists quickly proposed ways to improve the work. With Rouzi Tuerdi's help, the team cadres held a commune member meeting to discuss why there was so much wheat scattering during the harvest and why the harvesting was slow. As a result, the team's enthusiasm was quickly boosted, and the wheat harvest work improved.
    One day, someone told him that there were problems with watering the cotton fields in the Wuxing Production Team. He went to the fields and saw that some cotton plants were suffering from drought, and the pre-summer peaches had cracked and burst due to the sun. Some were flooded due to careless irrigation, but the cadres all said that a bumper cotton harvest was a foregone conclusion. In order to correct this complacency, he convened an on-site meeting of the production team and squad cadres, and took them to inspect the cotton fields that had suffered from drought due to untimely watering. He picked dry cotton bolls from the cotton plants that had dried up due to drought and weighed them. One hundred and three cotton bolls weighed only one catty, a reduction of nearly 20% compared to normally opened cotton bolls. Then, he led everyone to visit the cotton fields that had been flooded. Here, due to the irresponsibility of the commune members in watering, the water flooded everywhere, some places washed down cotton plants, and some places accumulated water in ponds. Due to excessive and premature watering, the cotton grew wildly, with very few flower buds. The team cadres had only seen the lush growth of the cotton, but now they were shocked to see these problems and regretted their complacency. At this time, Rouzi Tuerdi discussed measures with the team cadres. Everyone believed that the current time was a favorable opportunity for sitting autumn peaches, and that giving the cotton fields a final push could promote the formation of more and better peaches. After the meeting, each team immediately organized forces to improve the watering work, spray calcium superphosphate, and apply chemical fertilizers and prune the third-class seedlings. Rouzi Tuerdi also told this experience and lesson to each management area, and the entire commune immediately took action. After a week, the processed cotton fields changed their appearance, the third-class seedlings grew a lot taller, and the branches and leaves turned from yellow to black.
    As Long as it Benefits the Commune, No Difficulty is Feared
    This year, the wheat area of the Wuxing People's Commune expanded by more than 10,000 mu compared to last year, and the total output increased by more than double compared to last year. The staple food jumped from a shortage of seven or eight months every year to self-sufficiency. When it comes to grain self-sufficiency, the commune members all praise Rouzi Tuerdi. Last autumn, when the Turpan County Party Committee proposed to reclaim wasteland to expand the grain area and change the history of grain shortage in the economic crop area, it was during the Great Leap Forward in Steel Production. Nearly half of the labor force went to the mountains, and a large amount of manpower was needed for the Three Autumn harvests. The labor force was indeed tight, and there was only a little over a month left before sowing winter wheat. The wasteland and water sources were also nowhere to be found. Many commune cadres and commune members said that it was impossible to reclaim wasteland. Rouzi Tuerdi did not flinch in the face of these difficulties. He firmly supported wasteland reclamation at the commune Party committee meeting. After the decision to reclaim wasteland was made, he personally led the cadres to live on the Gobi desert to survey the wasteland and plan the canal system, without technical personnel for surveying. But after he returned from completing the surveying work, some cadres and commune members were still afraid of difficulties and reluctant to move forward, fearing that the labor force for wasteland reclamation could not be organized. He traveled day and night to these production teams, discussing with these cadres and commune members and encouraging them. He said: We are short of grain for seven or eight months every year, relying on the state to transfer grain from more than 1,000 kilometers away for support, and sometimes we eat white flour every day, but sometimes we eat coarse grains every day. Even livestock feed has to be purchased from thousands of miles away. Are we going to be like this forever? After he mobilized the cadres, everyone's thinking was straightened out. The male labor force of each production team automatically went out to reclaim wasteland and sow winter wheat, and the women went to the fields together to harvest cotton. After the wasteland reclamation team was organized, he personally went to the vast Gobi desert and worked with everyone for more than ten days, until all the specific problems of wasteland reclamation were solved before he left.
    The wasteland reclamation was arranged, but the water source was not settled; more than 20,000 mu of cotton had not been harvested. During the day, he sought out old farmers to solve the water source for the wasteland, and at night he returned to the commune to work with the women to rush to harvest cotton with kerosene lamps. After he visited and asked questions from east to west, he finally found a kanerjing that had been submerged by quicksand in the Gobi desert, which had been dug when the army was reclaimed before. He organized more than eighty laborers and worked hard for more than a month to dig through this old kanerjing and dig a new kanerjing. He ran through more than two hundred crisscrossing kanerjings, transferring water from east to west, and the problem of water for the winter wheat fields was finally solved. In this way, the difficulties that many people originally thought could not be overcome were overcome one by one. From September to November, the entire commune reclaimed nearly 10,000 mu of wasteland and sowed more than 5,000 mu of winter wheat (the remaining wasteland was planted with spring wheat). Neither iron smelting nor the Three Autumn harvests were delayed. But in those three months, Rouzi Tuerdi didn't sleep through the night once, and didn't eat on time for a single day. His wife told us that the children didn't see their father for three months. Sometimes he didn't come home, and sometimes he came back late at night and left before dawn.
    As long as you spend a day or two with Rouzi Tuerdi, you will find a distinct characteristic of him: he always devotes all his energy to the collective cause. As long as it benefits the commune and benefits everyone, he is not afraid of any difficulties, and he just moves forward with all his might.
    Extending a Helping Hand to Those in Need
    In the commune's Happiness Home, there live two teenage boys. They go to school together every day and eat in the canteen together. Visitors here will ask about their backgrounds. The older one is called Maihemaiti, fourteen years old; the younger one is called Baiximaiti, twelve years old. Their parents died three years ago and were raised by their uncle Abuduhadier. The selfish Abuduhadier didn't sew clothes for his nephews, and whenever he ate mixed noodles (a kind of superior food in rural areas), they were driven out of the house. Both children suffered from bald sores on their heads, and their uncle didn't give them treatment either. He only raised them for two months and then pushed them out. One day, Abuduhadier led his nephews to the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative and found Rouzi Tuerdi, saying, "The agricultural cooperative is strong, you raise them, I can't afford to raise them." After saying that, he turned around and left. The two orphans were ragged, with tears in their eyes, timid and shrinking. Rouzi Tuerdi felt a burst of sadness when he saw them. He already had three children, and his wife was often sick, but he thought, if even their own uncle is unwilling to raise them, who else can they be handed over to? He took them to his own home to raise them. Rouzi Tuerdi treated the two children like his own flesh and blood, eating together every day and sleeping on the same kang. Every night, he washed the maggot-infested bald sores of the two children with warm water, and then applied medicine. After curing the bald sores, he sewed new clothes for them and sent them to elementary school. He raised them for two years until the commune was established and the canteen and Happiness Home were established, and the two orphans left his home. This matter spread throughout Yar Lake, and people said that Rouzi Tuerdi was an extraordinary person.
    In fact, Rouzi Tuerdi's noble character is not just this one thing. Whenever others are in trouble, he always extends a friendly hand. He has raised orphans who have lost their parents, and he has also taken care of helpless old people. He has helped more than twenty poor and hired peasants start families. In the dead of winter, when he saw someone still wearing single clothes, he took off his felt boots and gave them to others. The widowed, lonely, and those who are in trouble all feel the warmth of the new society from him.

    一个好党员
    ——肉孜·吐尔的
    韩文慧　王安
    闲不住的人
    出吐鲁番古城西行进入五星人民公社，立即给人一种丰收的感觉。道路两旁，棉田里花蕾怒放，葡萄累累压满枝，瓜蔓上系着成串诱人的瓜果。看了这丰茂的庄稼，你就可以想像得到这个公社的生产工作搞得如何出色了。
    马车跑到五星人民公社门前，我们走进一座简陋的院落去拜访社主任肉孜·吐尔的，一位干部笑着说：“在这里你可找不到他，队上、地里，到处都是他的办公室。要找他，明天清早去食堂等他。”在公社院里，我们就和这位干部聊起社主任的工作方法来。他告诉我们，肉孜·吐尔的了解情况、解决问题一般都不在办公室。他是哪里有问题，就住在哪里解决，哪里有困难，就在哪里参加工作，帮助干部和社员克服困难。有时几天不回公社，有时晚上回来，天一亮又走了。他的家离公社办公室还不到五百米，但一年四季很少回家。大家都称他是闲不住的人。上月他听到民主生产队麦收和秋田管理工作进展迟缓，他便背上行李到这个队帮助工作。一到队上，就下地和社员一起割麦，边割麦边同社员交谈，社员见社主任拿起镰刀就干起来，都纷纷向他反映了队上的问题。老农、积极分子很快提出改进工作的办法，在肉孜·吐尔的的帮助下，队干部召开社员大会，讨论为什么麦收抛撒多、割的慢等问题。于是这个队的干劲很快鼓起来了，麦收工作有了起色。
    有一天，别人告诉他五星生产队棉田浇水有问题，他到地里一看，发现有的棉花受旱，伏前桃已晒裂吐絮，有的因灌水时不小心漫灌成灾，但干部们都说，棉花丰产已成定局。为了纠正这种自满情绪，他召集生产队、各小队干部开现场会议，带他们检查了未及时浇水而受旱的棉田，从棉株上摘下因受旱而干了的棉桃，剥开一秤，一百零三个棉桃只秤了一斤，比正常吐絮的棉桃减产将近20％，然后又带领大家参观了漫灌成灾的棉田，这里因社员浇水不负责任，大水漫灌，有的地方冲倒棉株，有的地方积水成潭，由于浇水过多、过早，棉花疯长起来，花蕾很少。原来队上干部只看到棉花长得丰茂，现在看到这些问题，才大吃一惊，后悔自己不该自满。这时，肉孜·吐尔的同队里的干部研究了措施，大家认为目前是座秋桃的有利时机，为棉田加最后一把力，可促进多座桃，结好桃。会后各队立即组织力量，改进浇水工作，喷洒过磷酸钙，给三类苗边施化肥边整枝。肉孜·吐尔的又把这个经验和教训告诉各管理区，于是全社立即行动起来，一周之后，经过加工的棉田变了样，三类苗株长了一大截，枝叶由黄变黑。
    只要有利于社　什么困难也不怕
    今年五星人民公社的小麦面积比去年扩大了一万多亩，总产量比去年猛增一倍以上，主粮从历年缺七、八个月一跃达到自给。提到粮食自给，社员们个个夸奖肉孜·吐尔的。去年秋后吐鲁番县委提出开荒扩大粮食面积、改变经济作物区缺粮的历史时，当时正是大炼钢铁之际，近半数劳力上了山，三秋尚需大批人力，劳力确实紧张，而且离种冬麦只一个多月，荒地、水源又无着落，许多社干部和社员都说无法开荒。肉孜·吐尔的在这种困难面前没有畏缩，他在公社党委会上坚决支持开荒，后来作出开荒决定之后，没有技术人员勘测，他亲自带了干部住到戈壁上勘察荒地，规划了渠系，分配好施工地区。但他完成勘测工作回来后，仍有些干部和社员畏难不前，怕开荒的劳动力组织不起来。他又日夜奔波在这些生产队，同这些干部和社员商量，向他们鼓气，他说：我们每年缺粮七、八个月，靠国家从一千多公里以外调粮支援，而且有时天天吃白面，有时却天天吃杂粮，连牲畜饲草也得到千里以外购买，难道我们永远这样吗？干部经他这一动员，大家的思想都通了。各生产队的男劳力自动出外开荒种冬麦，妇女一齐上地收棉花。开荒队伍组织起来后，他又亲自到大戈壁上，同大家一起劳动了十多天，直到开荒的一切具体问题解决后才离开。
    开荒安排好了，但水源没着落；两万多亩棉花又没有收完，白天他寻访老农解决荒地水源，晚上回到公社同妇女一起提上马灯突击收棉。经过他东访西问，终于在戈壁上找到了一条被流沙淹没的以前军队开垦时挖出的坎尔井，他组织了八十多个劳动力，苦战一个多月，挖通了这条旧坎尔井，挖了一条新坎尔井，他又跑遍二百多道纵横交错的坎尔井，从中东挪西调，冬麦地水的问题终于解决了。就这样，原来许多人认为根本不能克服的困难，结果一项一项地克服了。从9月到11月全公社开荒近万亩，播种冬麦五千多亩（其余荒地播了春麦），炼铁和三秋都未耽误。但在那三个月里，肉孜·吐尔的没睡过一次通宵觉，没有一天按时吃过饭。他爱人告诉我们，三个月孩子没有看见过爸爸，有时他不回家，有时深夜回来，天不明就走了。
    只要同肉孜·吐尔的相处一两天，你就会发现他一个鲜明的特征：他时时刻刻都把全部精力贯注在集体的事业中，只要有利于社、有利于大家，什么困难他都不怕，只是一股劲的向前干。
    向有困难的人伸出援助的手
    在公社幸福院里，住着两个十几岁的男孩子，他俩每天一同上学，一同到食堂吃饭，到这里的客人，都会问起他们的身世。大的叫买合买提，十四岁；小的叫拜喜买提，十二岁，三年前父母病故，由舅父阿不都哈的尔抚养。自私的阿不都哈的尔不给外甥缝衣服，每逢吃拌面（农村一种上等饭）时，他俩就被赶出门外，两个孩子头上都患有秃疮，舅父也不给治疗。只抚养了两个月就往外推。有一天，阿不都哈的尔领着外甥到五星农业社找着肉孜·吐尔的说：“农业社力量大，你们养起来吧，我养不起了”，说罢扭身就走了。两个孤儿衣衫褴褛，含着眼泪，畏畏缩缩。肉孜·吐尔的看了，不禁一阵心酸，本来他已有三个孩子，而且爱人多病，但心想亲舅舅都不愿抚养，还能交给别人吗？他就领到自己家里养起来。肉孜·吐尔的待两个孩子同亲骨肉一样，每天一同吃饭，在一个炕上睡觉。每晚给两个孩子用温水洗生了蛆的秃疮，然后抹上药水。治好秃疮以后，给他俩缝了新衣服，送到小学去念书。他整抚养了两年，直到公社成立，建立了食堂和幸福院以后，两个孤儿才离开他家。这件事，传遍了雅尔湖，人们都说肉孜·吐尔的是个不平常的人。
    其实，肉孜·吐尔的高尚的品德岂只这一件事，每当别人有困难的时候，他总是伸出友爱的手。他抚养过失去父母的孤儿，也侍养过无依无靠的老人，他帮助二十多个贫雇农成了家。三九寒天，他看到有人还穿着单衣，就把自己毡靴脱下来送给别人。住在这里的鳏寡孤独，或是遇着困难的人，都从他那里感到了新社会的温暖。
