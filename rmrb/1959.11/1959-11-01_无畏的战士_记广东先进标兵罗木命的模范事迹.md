The Fearless Warrior
——Remembering the Model Deeds of Guangdong Advanced Pacesetter Luo Muming

Comrade Luo Muming, the leader of the fitter team in the Second Metalworking Workshop of the Shantou Machinery Factory in Guangdong Province and a member of the Communist Party, was born into a poor peasant family. His father, mother, and older brother heroically sacrificed themselves for the revolutionary cause. He was raised by his elderly grandmother until he was ten years old. When his grandmother passed away, he became destitute and lived as a beggar. At the age of seventeen (1947), he joined the revolution and worked in the ordnance repair shop of the Dananshan Guerrilla Unit. After the liberation of Shantou, he was assigned to work in the machinery repair shop of the Chaoshan Mining Bureau. In 1952, he was transferred to the Shantou Machinery Repair Factory.

Comrade Luo Muming has always maintained a vigorous revolutionary drive and indomitable spirit, constantly innovating technology, and has successively improved and created 374 tools and equipment. His production team originally relied entirely on manual operation. Now, it has become equipped with 23 various machine tools (modular type), planers, milling machines, boring machines, drilling machines, and various specialized tools, enabling 80% of the team's production to be mechanized, increasing production efficiency several times, even hundreds of times, and completing eleven years' worth of work in four years. The production team he leads has already begun working on the tasks for 1967.

Remaining Determined Despite Impaired Vision, Unyielding
April 20, 1952, was a Sunday. At that time, the factory's production was affected because calcium carbide was not being supplied in time. Luo Muming was very anxious. That day, when he heard the news that several barrels of calcium carbide had been transported from Guangzhou, he was overjoyed and ran into the workshop alone to retrieve the calcium carbide for production the next day. However, because rainwater had seeped into the calcium carbide barrels during transportation, a violent impact caused the calcium carbide to explode when he struck it, severely injuring his eyes. After more than a year of treatment, his right eye only regained two to three tenths of its vision, and his left eye was eventually blinded due to severe injury.

In May 1954, Luo Muming returned to the factory. At that time, the factory leaders advised him to rest for a longer period, but he requested to be assigned work. Later, the leaders decided to let him work in the office as a translator, answering the phone (because the factory director and some cadres did not understand Chaozhou dialect). He worked for four or five days. Aside from translating a few sentences, there was nothing else to do. Seeing that all the workers in the factory were working hard, he resolutely requested to return to the workshop to produce. After his repeated and earnest requests, the factory director finally approved his request.

Everything for Socialism
Comrade Luo Muming is infinitely loyal to the Party and deeply loves the socialist cause, displaying the attitude of the working class as masters of their own affairs in everything he does. He believes that the plans of individuals and teams are part of the national plan, and failure to complete small plans will affect the completion of the larger plan. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the factory decided that the Second Metalworking Workshop had to produce 800 sweet potato slicing machines in June. This task was more than ten times the usual amount, and there was a significant shortage of labor and equipment at the time. In particular, processing the large flywheel of the sweet potato slicing machine was a major challenge. In the past, these components were processed by brother workshops, but at this time, the brother workshops also had heavy tasks, so the processing task was assigned to his workshop. How to arrange production? The workshop director felt difficult. Luo Muming thought, "There will inevitably be difficulties in the Great Leap Forward. No matter how great the difficulties are, they are not as difficult as fighting guerrilla warfare." So he took the initiative to ask the workshop director to assign the task of producing the large flywheel of the sweet potato slicing machine to his team. The workshop director was surprised and asked, "Can you do it?" He resolutely replied, "Where there are difficulties, there are solutions!" His team took on this task. After accepting the task, Luo Muming thought and thought and finally decided to focus on the old equipment. He found technician Wei Liran and deputy team leader Zhou Xiuchun to study together and came up with a solution: modify the horizontal drilling machine that had been improved in the past, add a fixture, and clamp the flywheel, so that the problem was solved. The next day, under his leadership, the whole team took advantage of their spare time to make a special tool for processing the large flywheel, breaking through the key obstacle of the lack of equipment for processing the large flywheel, and the production efficiency was increased by more than two times, so that 800 sweet potato slicing machines were completed ahead of schedule. It is because of this that the Luo Muming team has consistently overfulfilled its plan every month for the past four years.

Daring to Think and Act, Boldly Innovate
In order to complete the production tasks in a faster, better, and more economical way, Comrade Luo Muming demonstrated the communist style of daring to think and act in production, diligently studying and boldly innovating. He believes that the busier the production, the more skillfully it must be done. Innovating a technology can increase work efficiency by several times, even dozens of times. Therefore, no matter what the situation, he always uses his mind and puts his heart into it. Wherever there is a weak link in production, he goes to work on it. If there is a shortage of equipment in a certain process, he innovates in that process. When producing sprayer guns, he successively improved and created copper pipe sawing machines, rubber pipe cutting machines, crosshead grinding machines, etc., so that 21 of the 27 processes were mechanized. When producing automobile tire screws, he successively created tapping machines, double-headed edge milling machines, etc., so that 12 of the 15 processes were mechanized. Since last year, when producing vertical drilling machines and radial drilling machines, he has successively created soil planers, modular machine tools, boring machines, etc., thereby solving the difficulties of large workloads and severe equipment shortages in each period and successfully completing the national plan.

Luo Muming said: "To complete the national plan in a faster, better, and more economical way, we must take the road of technological revolution. Technological revolution is not something mysterious, but it is not an easy thing either. If we think about what we produce, and if there is a problem somewhere, we drill down there, and technological innovation will blossom and bear fruit." After he returned to work in 1954, due to his poor eyesight, he encountered many difficulties in production. For example, he could only saw 40 small copper tubes for sprayer guns per hour, which was half as many as an apprentice, and the quality was also poor. At that time, the innovative deeds of Zhang Mingshan and Wang Chonglun were spread to the Shantou Repair Factory, which gave Luo Muming great inspiration, and he began to have the idea of technological innovation. He had seen carpenters use money saws and use electricity to saw wood effortlessly, so he thought, wouldn't it be great if he could imitate this method to saw copper tubes? The more he thought about it, the more energetic he became. With the help of tool custodian Xu Rongquan, after several failures, he finally succeeded in trial-producing an electric copper pipe sawing machine. Ten copper pipes are clamped together, and the automatic circular saw blade can be moved to cut off the copper pipes. In the past, only 40 pieces could be sawed per hour, but now 350 pieces can be sawed per hour, and the quality is guaranteed. The success of the copper pipe sawing machine opened the door to emancipating the mind for Luo Muming himself. Since then, he has always stood at the forefront of technological innovation, leading comrades in the whole team, constantly innovating in response to the key points of production in each period.

In the process of technological innovation, Luo Muming has always insisted on diligent study, seeking truth from facts, and working in a down-to-earth manner. If his eyes couldn't see clearly, he used his hands to feel it. If he couldn't draw, he used a small blackboard and chalk to draw thick white lines to design the specifications of various parts. During the day, his eyes could vaguely see lines, but it was even more difficult at night. His eyes would ache if he stared for too long. Sometimes his wife would persuade him to rest and take care of his body. He always said, "I'm not tired!" and then continued to work.

Humbly Learning, Relying on the Masses
Over the past five years, Luo Muming has made continuous progress and made great contributions to the Party and the socialist cause, which is inseparable from his excellent style of humbly learning and uniting the masses. He always said to people: "The little achievements I have been able to make are first and foremost due to the Party and due to everyone. The Party is like water in the sea, and I am like a fish in the sea. The fish cannot live without water." He also said: "Learn from the advanced, leave no stone unturned, and after being advanced, don't forget to be even more advanced." Therefore, he is able to humbly learn from the advanced experiences of others. Every time he went to other places to participate in hero gatherings, he always eagerly brought back useful experiences.

"If the direction is unclear, ask the leaders; if there are difficulties in the work, find the masses." This is the reason why Luo Muming is able to constantly overcome difficulties. In the team, he insists on discussing matters with everyone, pooling ideas, and whenever there are major problems, he always raises them to the leadership core of the team for discussion and resolution, giving full play to the role of the team's leadership core. For example, in April of this year, the workshop assigned their team to produce 20 radial drilling machines. Because the castings were not supplied until the middle of the month, it seriously affected the completion of the plan. It seemed that the honor of maintaining the monthly overfulfillment of the task for four consecutive years would not be able to be maintained. At this critical juncture, Luo Muming and the Party group leader promptly convened a Party and Youth League meeting and a team member meeting, and put forward the fighting slogan of "Difficulties can be met, hardships can be endured, but the red flag must never be lost." In this way, all the workers in the team were high-spirited and full of energy, and completed the task on time, with quality, and in quantity, maintaining the collective honor.

"One red flower does not make a spring, but a spring with thousands of purples and reds." Luo Muming has a deep understanding of this sentence. He can treat the comrades around him with a comradely attitude, help them politically and ideologically, care for them in every possible way in life, and provide specific help and support in production technology. Therefore, everyone is happy to work hard and skillfully with him. In the second half of last year, two young workers were transferred to the Luo Muming team. One was Lu Wuneng, who usually did not have much enthusiasm for work and often had accidents. People called him "accident expert"; the other was Huang Shichuan, who had gone through six of the seven teams in the workshop, and no one welcomed him. Luo Muming suggested to the workshop leaders to transfer them to the team. He and everyone else treated them like brothers, educated Lu Wuneng by calculating the economic and political accounts, so that he understood the losses that accidents bring to the country, and strengthened his sense of responsibility as a master, while also providing technical assistance. Later, Lu Wuneng's awareness improved, his operation became skilled, and no more accidents occurred in production. Moreover, he was rated as the factory's youth shock worker and the factory's pacesetter in this year's "May Fourth" Youth Day. Huang Shichuan did not have complete bedding prepared last winter, so Luo Muming launched the team to help solve the problem, and helped him arrange his life. When his wife and children were sick, he visited his home, caring and asking questions as if they were brothers. Huang Shichuan was very touched and determined to do a good job in production to repay the care of the Party and comrades. When Huang Shichuan began to make achievements in his work, he praised and encouraged him. Now, Huang Shichuan has also become a production innovation expert and a pacesetter in the factory. Under the influence and education of Luo Muming and other Party members in the team, they truly achieved "no one lagging behind next to the advanced," and dozens of people in the whole team were of one mind, each with great enthusiasm, striving for excellence in production.

    无畏的战士
    ——记广东先进标兵罗木命的模范事迹
    广东省汕头机械厂第二金工车间钳工小组组长、共产党员罗木命同志出身于一个穷苦农民家庭。他的父亲、母亲和哥哥为革命事业壮烈牺牲。他靠年老的祖母抚养到十岁时，祖母去世了，他流离失所，过着乞丐生活。十七岁（1947年）那年，他参加了革命，在大南山游击队修械所工作。汕头解放后分配在潮汕矿务局机械修配厂做工。1952年调到汕头机械修配厂。
    罗木命始终保持着旺盛的革命干劲，坚韧不拔的精神，不断革新技术，先后改进和创造工具设备达三百七十四件。他所在的生产小组原来全部是手工操作，现在已变为拥有各种车床（积木式）、刨床、铣床、镗床、钻床等二十三部和各种专用工具，使小组的生产80％实现了机械化操作，使生产效率成倍几倍以至几百倍地提高，以四年的时间完成了十一年的工作量。他领导的生产小组，已经开始做1967年的工作。
    眼残志坚　顽强不屈
    1952年4月20日是星期天。当时，厂里因为电石供应不上，影响生产。罗木命心里十分焦急，这天，当他听到从广州运来了几桶电石的消息，喜出望外，独自跑进车间，准备取出电石供第二天生产。可是，由于电石桶运来时渗进雨水，当他猛力一敲时，引起了电石爆炸，眼睛受了重伤。经过一年多的治疗，右眼才恢复了两三成的视力，左眼因受重伤终于失明了。
    1954年5月，罗木命回厂。当时厂的领导劝他再休养一个时期，他却要求分配工作。后来，领导上决定让他在办公室当翻译接电话（因为厂长和有的干部不懂潮州话）。他干了四、五天，一天除了翻译几句话，就没有别的事。他看到全厂的职工都在紧张地劳动，他坚决提出回车间生产的要求。在他再三恳切要求下，厂长终于批准了他的请求。
    一切为了社会主义
    罗木命同志对党无限忠诚，对社会主义事业高度热爱，处处表现了工人阶级当家作主的态度。他认为：个人和小组的计划是国家计划的一部分，小计划不完成就会影响大计划的完成。大跃进的1958年，厂里决定6月份第二金工车间要生产八百部刨薯机。这个任务，比平常突增十几倍，当时无论在劳动力和设备上都感到大大不足，特别是加工刨薯机大飞轮更是一个难题。过去这些部件由兄弟车间负责加工，这时兄弟车间任务也很繁重，这个加工任务就下达到他的车间。如何安排生产呢？车间主任感到为难。罗木命想：“生产要大跃进，就必然会碰到困难，不管困难多大，总没有打游击困难。”于是他主动地向车间主任要求：把刨薯机大飞轮的任务交给他的小组。车间主任感到意外的问：“你们能干吗？”他毅然回答：“有困难有办法！”这个任务他们小组担当起来了。罗木命接受任务以后，想了又想最后把主意打在旧设备身上。他找技术员魏立然、副组长周修春一起研究，想出了一个办法：把过去改进的卧式钻床加以改装，再加上一个夹具，把飞轮夹持起来，这样问题就得到了解决。第二天在他的带动下，全组利用业余时间突击制成了一部加工大飞轮的专用工具，突破加工大飞轮设备缺乏的关键，生产效率提高了二倍多，使八百部刨薯机提前完成。正是由于这样，四年来，罗木命小组一直是月月超额完成计划。
    敢想敢干　大胆革新
    为了多快好省地完成生产任务，罗木命同志在生产上表现了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，苦学苦钻，大胆革新。他认为生产越忙就越要巧干，革新一项技术，就能成倍、几倍以至几十倍地提高工效。因而无论在什么情况下，他总是时时动脑筋，处处用心，生产上哪里出现薄弱环节，他便往哪里钻，哪个工序设备不足，他便在哪个工序闹革新。在生产喷雾器喷枪时，他先后改进和创造了锯铜管机、切橡皮管机、磨十字头机等等，使二十七道工序中有二十一道实现机械化操作。生产汽车轮胎螺丝时，他先后创造达牙机，双头铣边机等，使十五道工序中有十二道实现机械操作。去年以来生产立式钻床、摇臂钻床时，先后创造了土刨床、积木式车床、镗床等等，从而解决了每个时期工作量大、设备严重不足的困难，出色地完成了国家计划。
    罗木命说：“要多快好省地完成国家计划，必须走技术革命的道路。技术革命并不是什么神秘的东西，但也不是很容易的事。如果我们生产什么就想什么，哪里有问题，就往哪里钻，技术革新就会开花结果。”1954年他重返工作岗位之后，由于眼睛不好，在生产中碰到重重的困难，如锯喷雾器喷枪的小铜管，每小时只锯四十条，比学徒工还少一半，质量也差。那时张明山、王崇伦的革新事迹传到了汕头修配厂，给罗木命极大的启发，他开始产生技术革新的念头。他曾看见过木工用金钱锯，利用电力锯木头很省力，因此想到，要是能够仿照这个办法来锯铜管，那不是很好吗？越想越有劲，在工具保管员徐荣泉的帮助下，经过几次失败，终于试制成功一架电动锯铜管机。把十条铜管夹在一起，移动一下自动的圆锯盘，就可以把铜管锯断。过去每小时只能锯四十条，现在每小时可以锯三百五十条，质量又有了保证。锯铜管机的成功，对罗木命自己来说是打开了解放思想之门。从此，他一直站在技术革新的最前列，带动全组同志，经常针对每个时期的生产关键，不断闹革新。
    罗木命在技术革新的过程中一贯是坚持刻苦钻研，实事求是，踏踏实实地干。眼睛看不见，便用手摸着干，不会画图，便用一个小黑板用粉笔画上粗大的白线设计各种零件的规格。白天眼睛还可以模模糊糊地看到一道道的线条，晚上就更困难了，盯视的时间长了眼睛就发痛，有时他爱人劝他休息，注意身体。他总是说：“不累！”接着又干下去。
    虚心学习　依靠群众
    五年来，罗木命所以不断前进，对党对社会主义事业作出了很大的贡献，是和他的虚心学习，团结群众的优良作风分不开的。他总是这样对人说：“我所以能够做出一点点成绩，首先归功于党，归功于大家，党好比海中水，我好像海中鱼，鱼离开水就不能生活。”他还说：“学先进要点滴不漏，先进不忘再先进。”因此，他能够虚心学习别人的先进经验。他每次到外地参加群英会时，总是如饥似渴地把有益的经验带回来。
    “方向不明问领导，工作困难找群众”，这就是罗木命所以能够不断战胜困难的原因。在小组里他坚持有事和大家商量，集思广益，凡有重大问题，他总是提到小组的领导核心来讨论解决，充分发挥小组领导核心的作用。如今年4月，车间分配他们小组生产二十部摇臂钻床，因为铸件到中旬才陆续供应上，严重影响计划的完成，眼看连续四年来保持月月超额完成任务的荣誉，会有保不住的危险。在这紧要的关头，罗木命与党小组长及时召开了党团会议和组员会议，提出了“难可当，苦能受，红旗绝不能丢”的战斗口号，这样一来全组工人意气风发，干劲冲天，从而按期、按质、按量完成任务，保持了集体的荣誉。
    “一朵红花不成春，千紫万红方是春”，罗木命对这句话是有深切体会的。对待周围的同志，他能以同志式的态度，从政治思想上帮助他们，在生活上无微不至的关心，在生产技术上具体帮助支持。所以大家也乐于和他一起苦干巧干。去年下半年，罗木命小组调进两个青年工人，一个是吕武能，平时工作劲头不大，经常出事故，人家称他为“事故专家”；一个是黄史川，车间七个小组走遍六个，人家都不欢迎他。罗木命向车间领导建议调来组里。他就和大家一起以兄弟般的态度对待他们，通过算经济、政治细账，教育吕武能，使他懂得出事故给国家带来的损失，加强他的主人翁责任感，同时从技术上进行帮助。以后，吕武能觉悟提高了，操作熟练了，生产上再不出事故了，而且在今年“五四”青年节被评为厂的青年突击手和厂的标兵。黄史川去年冬天棉被没有准备齐全，罗木命便发动小组帮助解决，并帮助他安排生活，他爱人、孩子有病就登门探望，问寒问暖亲如兄弟。黄史川很受感动，决心搞好生产来报答党和同志们的关怀。当黄史川工作开始做出成绩的时候，就表扬鼓舞他。现在，黄史川也成为生产革新能手、厂里的标兵了。在罗木命和组内其他党员的影响和教育下，真正做到“先进者旁边无落后人”，全组几十个人一条心，个个干劲冲天，生产上力争上游。
