Xinhua News Agency, November 17th Dispatch from Jakarta: Indonesian public opinion supports Premier Zhou Enlai's proposals in his letter of November 7th to Indian Prime Minister Nehru regarding the Sino-Indian border issue.

Aidit, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, stated on November 11th regarding Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal that the people of Asia had hoped that either side of the two countries would take the initiative to propose talks on the Sino-Indian border issue, and now Premier Zhou Enlai's letter has fulfilled this wish.

Aidit said that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal, that the armed forces of China and India immediately withdraw twenty kilometers each from the so-called McMahon Line in the east and the actual line of control on both sides in the west, and that the prime ministers of the two countries hold talks in the near future, demonstrates great tolerance and reflects the Chinese side's grand desire to resolve the border issue through peaceful consultation based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference.

Aidit pointed out that the people of Asia and peace-loving people all over the world are now looking forward to the Indian government, especially Prime Minister Nehru. It is natural for the people of Asia to express this idea and sentiment, that is, to ask Nehru to welcome the hand extended by Premier Zhou in order to resolve the Sino-Indian border issue as soon as possible and prevent the enemies of Asia from taking advantage of the tensions between the two countries.

The National Council of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union Federation wrote letters to Prime Ministers Nehru and Zhou Enlai on the 16th, expressing the full support of the Indonesian people and workers for Premier Zhou's proposal to resolve the Sino-Indian border issue.

In its letter to Nehru, the Council hoped that the Indian government would accept Premier Zhou's proposal as the basis for a peaceful and friendly resolution of the Sino-Indian border issue, and hoped that the Indian government would take wise measures in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference.

In its letter to Premier Zhou, the Council pointed out that Premier Zhou's letter shows the world that China is wise and tolerant enough, and proves that China is loyal to the principles of the Bandung Conference.

The Indonesian Youth League, with one million members, also recently sent a telegram to Nehru urging him to accept Premier Zhou's proposal.

The Indonesian "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 14th saying that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal once again proves that China is loyal to the principles of peace and the Bandung principles, and once again demonstrates the sincerity of the Chinese side.

The editorial pointed out that it is now India's turn to speak. India's sincerity is being tested. If it really does not want to disturb the atmosphere in Asia, then it cannot refuse China's reasonable proposal. The editorial expressed the hope that Prime Minister Nehru would adopt a reasonable approach guided by the spirit of Bandung, rather than succumbing to the pressure of imperialists and the right-wing elements of the Congress Party.

"Dongxing Bao" stated in its editorial on the 14th that the proposal made by Premier Zhou in his letter to Prime Minister Nehru is full of sincerity and a spirit of mutual concession, and is also in line with the spirit of Afro-Asian cooperation.

The editorial said that at a time when activities hindering Sino-Indian relations and attempting to hinder the friendly relations between China and other Asian countries are becoming increasingly rampant, Premier Zhou's proposal is very timely.

The Indonesian-language "Xinbao" published an editorial on the 11th pointing out that Premier Zhou's proposal is a positive proposal, and it is a victory for peace.

The editorial believes that Nehru should not lose the opportunity. The editorial accused some people of trying to fish in troubled waters in the disputes between Asian countries.

Xinhua News Agency, November 17th Dispatch from Colombo: The Chairman of the Ceylon-China Friendship Association, former Ceylonese Ambassador to China, Pereira, said at the opening ceremony of the Chinese photo exhibition on the 13th that he hoped Nehru would hold talks with Premier Zhou Enlai to resolve the Sino-Indian border issue.

Pereira said that the current differences between China and India must be resolved through friendly discussions between the two countries. It is out of this hope that the Executive Committee of the Ceylon-China Friendship Association once expressed the hope that the prime ministers of the two countries would hold talks as soon as possible in the spirit of Panchsheel, which they first proposed, to resolve their difficulties, without allowing others to interfere and undermine the friendship between the two countries.

He welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal to meet with Prime Minister Nehru. He said that both prime ministers have mentioned in their statements the friendship between the two countries for thousands of years, and he hoped to resolve the differences in a spirit of friendship.

Pereira emphasized that we sincerely hope that the two great leaders of Asia will hold talks in the coming weeks. Time is an extremely important factor. He asked that those who wish to see the two countries split should not obstruct such a meeting.

He said that Premier Zhou Enlai had said earlier that the border issues between China and other countries could be resolved through discussions between friendly countries. Pereira said that this shows that China's attitude is consistent.

Pereira pointed out that the McMahon Line treaty was never signed by the Chinese.

He said that the road to negotiation is now open. Let the two prime ministers hold talks as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, November 17th Dispatch from Phnom Penh: The Cambodian "Nationalist" said on the 14th, commenting on Premier Zhou Enlai's letter regarding the proposal to resolve the Sino-Indian border issue, "As friends of China and India, we warmly welcome this proposal and hope that Zhou Enlai and Nehru will hold talks soon."

The Cambodian "Friendship Newspaper" said on the 12th that the important proposal made by Premier Zhou Enlai is unanimously welcomed by peace-loving people. The Cambodian people love peace and are friends of both India and China, and they also welcome these proposals.

The newspaper pointed out that the imperialists are hostile to the policy of neutrality, and they believe that people must reject Zhou Enlai's proposal. They do not like these proposals because they want to incite conflict.

Xinhua News Agency, November 17th Dispatch from Baghdad: The Iraqi "National Newspaper" said in an international commentary on the 11th that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal to Nehru on November 7th "is very reasonable; these proposals will prevent the imperialists' incitement from succeeding, thereby making it possible for Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru to meet in order to resolve the dispute between the two countries through peaceful negotiations."

The newspaper condemned the imperialists and their followers for using the Sino-Indian border incident to try to undermine the friendly relations between the two countries and to wantonly slander China. The newspaper expressed its firm belief that the situation between India and the People's Republic of China will return to normal, thereby benefiting world peace in order to defeat the conspiracies of imperialists and reactionaries.

    新华社17日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚公众支持周恩来总理在11月7日写给印度总理尼赫鲁的信中所提出的有关中印边界问题的建议。
    印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会主席艾地11日就周恩来总理的建议发表谈话指出，对于中印边界问题，亚洲人民曾经希望两国的任何一方采取主动，提出会谈的建议，现在周恩来总理的信已经满足了这个愿望。
    艾地说，周恩来总理在信中的建议，中国和印度的武装部队立即从东边的所谓麦克马洪线和西边的双方实际控制线各后撤二十公里，两国总理在最近期间举行会谈。这表现了巨大的容忍，并且反映了中国方面希望根据和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则通过和平协商的办法来解决边界问题的宏大愿望。
    艾地指出，亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平的人民现在正期待着印度政府，特别是尼赫鲁总理。如果亚洲人民表示这种想法和情绪，即要求尼赫鲁欢迎周总理伸出的双手，以便尽快解决中印边界问题，防止亚洲的敌人利用两国间的紧张局势，那是很自然的。
    全印度尼西亚中央职工会全国理事会16日分别写信给尼赫鲁和周恩来总理，表示印度尼西亚人民和工人完全支持周总理关于解决中印边界问题的建议。
    理事会在给尼赫鲁的信中希望印度政府接受周总理的建议，把它作为和平友好地解决中印边界问题的基础，并且希望印度政府根据和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则采取明智措施。

    拥有一百万名团员的印度尼西亚青年团最近也打电报给尼赫鲁，敦促他接受周总理的建议。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”14日发表社论说，周恩来总理的建议再次证明，中国忠于和平原则和万隆原则，并且再次显示了中国方面的诚意。
    社论指出，现在该印度开口了。印度的诚意正在受到考验。如果它确实不想扰乱亚洲的气氛，那么它不可能拒绝中国的这种合理的建议。社论表示希望尼赫鲁总理采取以万隆精神为指南的合理方法，而不是屈从帝国主义者，和国大党右翼分子的压力。
    “东星报”在14日发表的社论指出，周总理在给尼赫鲁总理的信中所提出的建议充满着诚意和互让精神，也是符合亚非合作的精神的。
    社论说，在妨碍中印关系和企图妨碍中国和其他亚洲国家的友好关系的活动日益猖獗的时候，周总理的这个建议是非常切合时宜的。
    印度尼西亚文“新报”11日发表社论指出，周总理的建议是一个积极的建议，这是和平的胜利。
    社论认为尼赫鲁不应该失去机会。社论指责某些人企图在亚洲国家的争执中混水摸鱼。
    新华社17日讯　科伦坡消息：锡中友好协会主席、前锡兰驻中国大使佩雷拉13日在中国图片展览会开幕仪式上讲话时，表示希望尼赫鲁同周恩来总理举行会谈来解决中印边界问题。
    佩雷拉说，中印两国目前的分歧必须由两国举行友好讨论来解决。正是出于这种希望，锡中友好协会执行委员会曾经表示希望两国总理本着他们首先提出的潘查希拉的精神尽早举行会谈，解决他们的困难，而不让别人有进行干涉的余地，从而破坏两国的友谊。
    他表示欢迎周恩来总理提出的同尼赫鲁总理会谈的建议。他说，两国总理在声明中都谈到了两国之间好几千年的友谊，希望本着友好的精神解决分歧。
    佩雷拉强调说，我们非常真诚地希望亚洲的两位伟大领袖将在最近几星期内举行会谈。时间是极其重要的因素。他要求，不让那些希望两国分裂的人们阻挠这样一次会谈。
    他说，周恩来总理在早些时候就说过，关于中国和其他国家之间的边境的问题，可以通过友好国家之间的讨论来解决。佩雷拉说，这说明中国的态度是一贯的。
    佩雷拉指出，关于麦克马洪线的条约，从来没有为中国人所签署。
    他说，现在谈判的道路是开着的。让两国总理尽早举行会谈吧。
    新华社17日讯　金边消息：柬埔寨“民族主义者”14日在评论周恩来总理给尼赫鲁的信件中关于解决中印边界问题的建议时说，“作为中国和印度的朋友，我们热烈欢迎这个建议，并且希望周恩来和尼赫鲁最近举行会谈。”
    柬埔寨“友谊报”12日说，周恩来总理所提出的重要建议受到爱好和平人民的一致欢迎。柬埔寨人民爱好和平，并且是印中两国的朋友，他们也欢迎这些建议。
    这家报纸指出，但是帝国主义者敌视中立政策，他们认为，人们必须拒绝周恩来的建议。他们不喜欢这些建议，因为他们想煽动冲突。
    新华社17日讯　巴格达消息：伊拉克“国家报”11日在国际评论中说，周恩来总理11月7日向尼赫鲁提出的建议“是十分合理的；这些建议将使帝国主义的煽动不能得逞，从而将使周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理的会晤成为可能，以便通过和平谈判来解决两国之间的争端”。
    报纸谴责帝国主义者及其追随者利用中印边境事件设法破坏这两个国家之间的友好关系以及对中国的肆意污蔑。报纸表示坚信，印度和中华人民共和国之间的事态将恢复正常，从而有利于世界和平，以便击败帝国主义和反动派的阴谋活动。
