    New Approaches to Breeding Domestic Fish

    In September 1958, the Institute of Experimental Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in cooperation with the Zhejiang Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute, conducted a survey of the gonadal development of silver carp and bighead carp in the Qiantang River and the Shangcheng River in Hangzhou. They discovered that some parent fish had well-developed ovaries in the autumn. Therefore, they decided to use a newly prepared spawning agent for inducing spawning trials, and both trials were successful. Through this experiment, an effective spawning agent and its method of use were found, thereby breaking the seasonality of spawning and hatching of domestic fish, breaking the superstition that domestic fish in ponds cannot conceive or spawn, and opening up a new way to breed fish fry using farmed female fish. According to preliminary understanding, this method has begun to be promoted in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan and other places this year, and millions of fish fry have been produced.

    家鱼繁殖的新途径
    1958年9月，中国科学院实验生物研究所与浙江淡水水产研究所合作，进行钱塘江和杭州上城河的鲢、鳙的生殖腺发育调查，发现秋季里也有卵巢发育良好的亲鱼，因而决定利用新制备的一种催产剂进行催产试验，两次试验均获成功。通过这次试验，找到了一种有效的催产剂及其使用方法，从而打破了家鱼产卵化苗的季节性，打破了池塘家鱼不能怀卵、产卵的迷信，并开辟了利用家养母鱼繁殖鱼苗的新途径。据初步了解，今年浙江、江苏、福建、广东、湖南等地均开始推广使用这一方法，已生产了数百万尾鱼苗。
