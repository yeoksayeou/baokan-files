    Longfeng Adds a New Open-Pit Mine
    In the heat of the coal production campaign, the workers of the Fushun Longfeng Mine built an open-pit mine with a daily output of 1,000 tons in just one month. This open-pit mine officially started producing coal on the 11th, and the daily output reached 1,009 tons on the 13th.
    This open-pit mine was built by cadres from the administrative departments and some workers' families without any state investment.

    龙凤新添露天坑
    抚顺龙凤矿职工在夺煤大战中，仅用一个月的时间就建成了一个日产千吨的露天坑。这个露天坑在十一日正式出煤，十三日日产量就达到了一千零九吨。
    这个露天坑是由机关科室干部和一部分职工家属建设的，没有用国家投资。
