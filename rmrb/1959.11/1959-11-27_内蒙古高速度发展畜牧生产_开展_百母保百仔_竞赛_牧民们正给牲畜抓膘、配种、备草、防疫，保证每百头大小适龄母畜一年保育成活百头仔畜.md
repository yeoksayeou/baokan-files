Inner Mongolia Develops Animal Husbandry at High Speed
Launches "Guarantee 100 Lambs from 100 Ewes" Competition
Mongolian Herdsmen are fattening livestock, mating, preparing grass, and preventing epidemics to ensure that one hundred live offspring are raised per hundred mature female animals each year.

Hohhot, November 26th (reported by this newspaper) – A new upsurge in animal husbandry production, the "Guarantee 100 Lambs from 100 Ewes" movement, is vigorously unfolding on the Inner Mongolian grasslands. The "100 Lambs from 100 Ewes" campaign aims to ensure that in the animal husbandry year of 1960 (from July of this year to June of next year), an average of one hundred live offspring will be raised for every one hundred mature female animals (in the 1959 year, the average was seventy-three live offspring per hundred mature female animals). This is a mass movement to ensure the rapid rise of animal husbandry production. Currently, more than seventy banners (counties) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have successively put forward the fighting slogan of achieving "100 Lambs from 100 Ewes," and many areas are further improving livestock feeding management, strengthening mating and supplementary mating of female animals, and launching a socialist labor competition centered on the "100 Lambs from 100 Ewes" movement.

The "100 Lambs from 100 Ewes" movement was initiated by Hangjin Banner on the Ordos Grassland. After the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were implemented, herdsmen of all ethnic groups in Hangjin Banner, encouraged by soaring enthusiasm, under the leadership of the Hangjin Banner Committee of the CPC, launched an upsurge in animal husbandry production centered on the "100 Lambs from 100 Ewes" movement. The banner set a goal for next year of raising 369,700 live offspring from the banner's 330,000 mature female animals, averaging 112 offspring per 100 mature female animals. They also put forward a competition proposal to all banners, counties, and cities in the autonomous region to carry out the "100 Lambs from 100 Ewes" movement. This proposal received a warm response from herdsmen throughout the region.

Party committees at all levels on the Ordos Grassland universally organized "100 Lambs from 100 Ewes" movement committees, led by the secretaries, strengthening leadership. The broad masses of herdsmen, focusing on fattening, mating, storing grass, preparing feed, and preventing epidemics, launched a red banner competition movement between banners, communes, and herds, "fighting for a greater harvest in animal husbandry." People's communes on the Bayannur Grassland have already transferred more than 8,000 laborers to build livestock pens. Hundreds of veterinarians from all ethnic groups, carrying medicines, have also gone deep into the herds to strengthen the prevention and control of various livestock diseases. In order to ensure that livestock safely survive the snowy season on the grasslands, herdsmen on the Xilin Gol and Hulunbuir Grasslands have driven more than 4 million head of livestock to winter camps, further strengthening the maintenance of body condition and pregnancy of female animals. They have also stored more than 3 billion catties of fodder and a large amount of feed in the winter camps, creating favorable conditions for achieving "100 Lambs from 100 Ewes."

The herdsmen of Hangjin Banner, who first proposed the competition initiative, relying on the great advantages of the People's Communes, under the leadership of the Party, are exerting great efforts and carrying out mass movements on a large scale. At present, 90% of the banner's 330,000 mature female animals have been impregnated, and the rest are being mated and supplemented, striving to achieve full mating and pregnancy. If the survival rate of these pregnant female animals can be increased to more than 87%, more than 287,280 live offspring can be raised. Secondly, the herdsmen are vigorously grasping the "two productions in three years" of female animals. After lambing this spring, the herdsmen of this banner have already mated a batch of summer lambs, and now more than 15,740 lambs have survived, which is unprecedented. The banner also has more than 150,000 ewes that have begun to produce winter lambs. Herdsmen are both tending to winter lambs and mating the healthy ewes that have produced lambs. In this way, Hangjin Banner will be able to raise more than 369,700 live offspring next year, averaging 120 offspring per 100 mature female animals.

Recently, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the CPC convened a region-wide animal husbandry production inspection and appraisal meeting and a region-wide on-site animal husbandry production radio conference, calling on herdsmen and farmers throughout the region to exert great efforts and carry out socialist labor competition centered on the "100 Lambs from 100 Ewes" movement.

    内蒙古高速度发展畜牧生产
    开展“百母保百仔”竞赛
    牧民们正给牲畜抓膘、配种、备草、防疫，保证每百头大小适龄母畜一年保育成活百头仔畜
    本报呼和浩特26日电　一个“百母保百仔”的畜牧业生产新高潮正在内蒙古草原上蓬勃开展起来。“百母百仔”运动，就是要求在畜牧业1960年度（今年7月至明年6月为一个年度）每一百头大小适龄母畜，平均保育成活一百头仔畜（1959年度每百头大小适龄母畜平均繁殖成活仔畜七十三头）。这是一个保证畜牧业生产迅速上升的群众运动。现在，内蒙古自治区七十多个旗（县）纷纷提出了一定要实现“百母百仔”的战斗口号，许多地区正进一步改善牲畜饲养管理，加强母畜配种补配，开展以“百母百仔”运动为中心的社会主义劳动竞赛。
    “百母百仔”运动是由鄂尔多斯草原上的杭锦旗发起的。党的八届八中全会决议贯彻执行以后，杭锦旗的各族牧民，鼓起了冲天干劲，在中共杭锦旗委员会领导下，掀起了以“百母百仔”运动为中心的畜牧业生产高潮，确定明年从全旗三十三万头大小适龄母畜，要保育成活三十六万九千七百头仔畜，平均每一百头大小适龄母畜获得一百十二头仔畜的奋斗目标，并向全自治区各旗县市提出开展“百母百仔”运动的竞赛倡议。这一倡议得到全区牧民的热烈响应。
    鄂尔多斯草原上各级党委普遍组织了“百母百仔”运动委员会，书记挂帅，加强领导；广大牧民以抓膘、配种、贮草、备料和防疫为中心，旗与旗、公社与公社、畜群与畜群之间，热火朝天地开展了“为夺取畜牧业的更大丰收而战”的红旗竞赛运动。巴彦淖尔草原各人民公社，已经抽调八千多个劳动力来修建牲畜圈棚。成百上千的各族兽医人员，也带着药品，深入畜群，加强了各种牲畜的兽疫防治工作。为了保证牲畜安全度过草原风雪季节，锡林郭勒和呼伦贝尔草原上的牧民们，把四百多万头牲畜赶到冬营地，进一步加强母畜的保膘保胎。并且在冬营地上贮备了三十多亿斤饲草和大量的饲料，为实现“百母百仔”创造有利条件。
    首先提出竞赛倡议的杭锦旗的牧民们，依靠人民公社的巨大优越性，在党的领导下，鼓足干劲，大搞群众运动。目前全旗三十三万头大小适龄母畜的90％已经受胎怀孕，其余的正在配种和补配，力争实现全配满怀，把这批母畜的繁殖成活率提高到87％以上，就能保育成活二十八万七千二百八十多头仔畜。其次，牧民们正在大抓母畜的二年三产。今年春季接羔后，这个旗的牧民已经配种了一批夏羔，现在保育成活了一万五千七百四十多只羊羔，这是过去从来没有过的。全旗还有十五万多只母羊，已经开始产冬羔，牧民们一方面接冬羔，一方面又为产羔的健壮母羊进行配种。这样，明年杭锦旗就能保育成活三十六万九千七百多头仔畜，平均每一百头大小适龄母畜，将获得一百二十头仔畜。
    最近，中共内蒙古自治区委员会召开了全区畜牧业生产检查评比会议和全区畜牧业生产现场广播大会，号召全区牧民和农民，鼓足干劲，以“百母百仔”运动为中心，开展社会主义劳动竞赛。（附图片）
