Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, November 22nd: Recently, a large number of industrial and mining enterprises in Romania have completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule, or have achieved their annual savings guarantees.

The national petroleum geological prospecting personnel of Romania have completed this year's annual drilling plan forty-seven days ahead of schedule. They reduced drilling costs by 32% compared to last year and increased labor productivity by 43%. Now, the drilling workers have made a promise to overfulfill the drilling plan by another 23,000 meters before the end of the year.

The foundry workshop of the "Seeder" factory in Bucharest and the electric furnace workshop of the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine have both completed this year's production plans ahead of schedule. Steel rolling workers at the Red Steel Plant in Hunedoara State have produced more than 15,000 tons of steel for the country beyond the plan, fulfilling their production guarantees more than fifty days ahead of schedule.

In terms of practicing economy, Romanian workers have also achieved great success. In the first eight months of this year, the country has saved more than 1.17 billion lei (Romanian currency). Now, thirty industrial enterprises in Timisoara State and nine large industrial enterprises in Galati State have completed their annual savings plans ahead of schedule, saving a total of more than 149 million lei. In addition, the employees of the national sugar industry also fulfilled their annual savings guarantee in early November.

At present, in those industrial and mining enterprises that have completed this year's production or savings plans ahead of schedule, the production enthusiasm of the employees continues to rise. The employees of these enterprises have put forward new production and savings plans, striving to create more achievements for the country. Those enterprises that have not yet completed their annual plans are also seizing the time to strive to complete their annual plans ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 22nd: In the first ten months of this year, Czechoslovakia's industrial production plan was fulfilled by 101.5%, and the total industrial output value increased by 10.7% compared with the same period last year. Among them, power generation increased by 11.3%, and the output of pig iron and steel increased by 12.8% and 10.7% respectively, and cement production increased by 17.2%.

In the first ten months of this year, the total output value of general machinery manufacturing increased by 18.3% compared with the same period last year. Among them, diesel engines increased by 19.7%, tractors increased by 18.4%, and automatic and semi-automatic machine tools increased by 20%. The production of other industrial sectors has also increased. For example, the total output value of the chemical industry increased by 15.4%.

The reason why Czechoslovakia's industrial production achieved the above-mentioned results in the first ten months of this year is mainly due to the unprecedented increase in the enthusiasm of the employees. About 75% of the workers in the country's industrial enterprises participated in the socialist production competition. As a result of carrying out the socialist production competition, industrial enterprises produced 848 million crowns (Czechoslovak currency) worth of products more than originally planned in the first eight months of this year, and saved the country 378 million crowns from reducing production costs.

Now, some industrial enterprises in various parts of Czechoslovakia have completed this year's annual production targets ahead of schedule. It is estimated that the annual plan for national industrial production is expected to be completed one week ahead of schedule. (Attached picture)

    罗大批企业提前完成全年生产计划
    捷头十个月工业生产计划超额完成
    新华社布加勒斯特22日电　最近，罗马尼亚又有大批工矿企业提前完成了今年全年的生产计划，或者实现了全年的节约保证。
    罗马尼亚全国石油地质勘探人员已经提前四十七天完成了今年全年的钻井计划。他们把钻井成本比去年降低了32％，把劳动生产率提高了43％。现在，钻井工人们又提出诺言，保证在年底以前再超计划钻井二万三千米。
    布加勒斯特的“播种机”工厂的翻砂车间和洪尼多阿拉冶金联合工厂的电炉车间，都提前完成了今年的生产计划。洪尼多阿拉州红色钢铁厂的轧钢工人已经超计划为国家生产了一万五千多吨钢材，提前五十多天实现了自己的生产保证。
    在厉行节约方面，罗马尼亚工人也获得了很大成就。在今年头八个月中，全国已经节约了十一亿七千多万列伊（罗币名）。现在，底密索拉州已经有三十个工业企业、加拉齐州有九个大型工业企业提前完成了全年的节约计划，它们共节约了一亿四千九百多万列伊。此外，全国制糖工业的职工也在11月初实现了全年的节约保证。
    目前，在那些已经提前完成今年生产计划或节约计划的工矿企业里，职工的生产热潮仍在不断上升。这些企业的职工纷纷提出了新的生产节约计划，争取为国家创造出更多的成绩。那些还没有完成全年计划的企业也在抓紧时间，争取提前完成全年计划。
    新华社布拉格22日电　在今年头十个月中，捷克斯洛伐克的工业生产计划完成了101.5％，与去年同期相比，工业总产值增加了10.7％。其中，发电量增加了11.3％，生铁和钢的产量分别增加了12.8％和10.7％，水泥产量增加了17.2％。
    在今年头十个月中，普通机械制造业的总产值比去年同期增加了18.3％。其中，柴油发动机增加了19.7％，拖拉机增加了18.4％，自动和半自动机床增加了20％。其他工业部门的生产也增加了。例如，化学工业总产值增加了15.4％。
    今年头十个月，捷克斯洛伐克工业生产之所以取得上述的成绩，主要是由于职工的积极性空前提高。在全国工业企业中，约有75％的工人参加了社会主义生产竞赛。由于开展社会主义生产竞赛的结果，今年头八个月中，工业企业就比原计划多生产了价值八亿四千八百万克朗（捷币名）的产品，并且从降低生产成本中为国家节约了三亿七千八百万克朗。
    现在，捷克斯洛伐克各地有些工业企业已经提前完成了今年全年的生产指标。据估计，全国工业生产的年度计划可望提前一星期完成。（附图片）
