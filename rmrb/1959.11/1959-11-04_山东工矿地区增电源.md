Two more generator units on the Shandong power industry front have recently been put into production. One is a 12,000-kilowatt unit at the Xintai Power Plant, and the other is a 25,000-kilowatt unit at the Zibo Nanding Thermal Power Plant. After these two units are put into production, they can initially meet the electricity needs of the Xinwen and Zibo mining areas. At the same time, they can also play a significant role in increasing the power supply capacity of the Jinan area.

    山东工矿地区增电源
    山东电力工业战线上又有两个发电机组在最近投入生产，一个是新泰电厂的一万二千瓩机组，一个是淄博南定热电厂的二万五千瓩机组。这两个机组投入生产以后，可以初步满足新汶、淄博两个工矿区的用电需要，同时对增加济南地区的供电能力，也能起很大作用。
