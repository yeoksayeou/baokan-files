Coral Sand
Jun Qing

This is an oasis in the heart of the Qiantang River. Its name is Coral Sand.

If the Qiantang River is like a silver ribbon, then Coral Sand is like a small, exquisite emerald gemstone inlaid on this silver ribbon.

What a beautiful and prosperous oasis this is, simply a paradise on earth. I feel very fortunate because at this moment I am living in this earthly paradise.

Look, the silver torrent of the Qiantang River rolls eastward, encircling the oasis. Along the riverbank, a wide and long dike, like a green brocade screen, tightly embraces the oasis. Above the long dike, graceful weeping willows sway gently in the wind, their long tendrils softly brushing the roofs of the homes on the island; below the long dike, there is a green lawn and shimmering ponds, herds of cattle and sheep graze on the grass, and countless ducks and geese play in the ponds; inside the long dike, there is an endless expanse of golden rice paddies, and the wind blowing from the river sweeps across the rice fields, creating shimmering golden waves. …

Now, it is the season for harvesting late rice. Since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the great call to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale, a vigorous new high tide of production has been surging on this river island oasis. The loudspeakers hanging on the willow trees broadcast day and night the slogans of the commune Party committee about speeding up the rush harvest and planting to lay a good foundation for the great leap forward next year, and a bustling labor competition is underway. In the fields, there are busy crowds everywhere, and cheerful songs everywhere. Sickles are rustling, threshing machines are roaring, and in the distance, on the harvested rice fields, comes the thunderous rumble of tractors driven by female tractor drivers plowing and planting. …

In the morning sunlight, listening to this huge and intense sound, I feel extremely excited. What an exciting sound this is! From this symphony-like sound, I seem to hear the footsteps of a towering giant moving forward. How familiar this sound is! I heard it during the arduous War of Resistance Against Japan; I heard it during the fierce War of Liberation; I heard it during the years of national economic recovery; I heard it during the days of socialist transformation and socialist construction. And especially since the Great Leap Forward, this sound has become even greater and louder.

What an inspiring sound this is! Isn’t our motherland, our cause, leaping forward a thousand miles a day in this inspiring sound? Isn't Coral Sand, this paradise-like oasis, a good proof of this?

Production team leader Yuan Zufu, pointing to a dense rice field in front of him, told me that on this sandy land, where the yield was less than a hundred catties per mu before liberation, there have been bumper harvests year after year since liberation. Especially in last year's Great Leap Forward, the total output jumped to an average of 480 catties per mu, reaching three times the output of the previous year. And the yield of early rice this year increased by 155% compared with last year. Although the current late rice has not yet been fully calculated, it can be confidently stated that it will certainly greatly exceed the early rice.

This figure may not attract much attention to those who do not understand the history of Coral Sand? However, it surprised me a lot. Because I know that this rich and beautiful oasis was a barren and uninhabited sandy beach forty years ago. At that time, the white waves of the river washed the edge of the beach day and night, especially during the autumn flood season, when the rushing floods flooded the sandbar everywhere. At that time, there were no living creatures on the sandbar except wild ducks, waterfowl, reeds, and weeds. In 1914, peasant Yu Jinzhong came here and became the first resident on the sandbar. Soon, Yuan Zufu's family of seven, who had nowhere to turn, and some other poor brothers also came here one after another. They built shacks in higher places and cleared fields in the reeds. However, for more than forty years, the thin soil on this sandbar has given people very little. At most, it yielded only seventy or eighty catties per mu each year, and sometimes not even a catty could be harvested, because once the flood came, the hard-earned labor of the whole year would be washed away. Therefore, the people on the sandbar have always struggled in a precarious environment. More than forty long years have passed, and the desolate appearance of the sandbar has not changed in any way, nor has the tragic fate of the sandbar residents been changed in any way. Until the eve of liberation, this was still a desolate sandbar with only twenty households and more than one hundred residents.

In the second year after liberation, the People's Government allocated huge funds to build three encircling dikes along the riverbank, blocking the untamed river water and the rushing floods. Later, it also led the people on the island to organize mutual aid teams and cooperatives, winning the first harvest for the barren and impoverished sandbar. Since then, the appearance of the sandbar has been changing day by day. However, the huge change took place in 1958 - the year when the Chinese people held high the red flag of the General Line and made a vigorous Great Leap Forward. In this year, the people on the sandbar joyfully joined the people's commune and became one with the vast number of peasant brothers outside the isolated island, so their strength became even more magnificent. In this year, they built a solid sluice gate in the river gorge leading to the land. This sluice gate controlled the river water, so that it could no longer arbitrarily invade the residents of the island, and it had to honestly serve the residents. People excitedly called this sluice gate the "Great Leap Forward Gate." Adjacent to the Great Leap Forward Gate, people also built a high and wide road, which extends from the depths of the oasis all the way to the other side of the river, connecting with the land. From then on, the people on the island no longer needed to take a ferry to go to the mainland. People happily call this road the "Happiness Road."

Happiness Road, what a beautiful, accurate and meaningful name this is!

This road not only leads from the depths of the oasis to the mainland, but also from the hearts of the people on the island to Beijing, to Chairman Mao, and to the Party Central Committee. This road is none other than the General Line for Socialist Construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune.

It is this road that has enabled the people on the island to reach a state of prosperity in such a short period of time. Now, this is already an oasis with more than seventy households. The more than four hundred residents of the island are living a happy life that their ancestors never dreamed of. Now they have tractors for farming, water pumps for irrigation, and public canteens for meals. This canteen withstood the not-so-small evil wind this spring and has been persisting. The food is very good, and the members are all satisfied. Their children are taken care of by nurseries. They will no longer be like their parents, squatting in front of collapsed shacks on the days of high tides, watching the rolling floods that have taken away their rice, sadly shedding tears and desperately shouting. Not to mention the children, even the young lads have long forgotten the tragic past. Now, many of them ride shiny bicycles when they go out. …

Yuan Zufu, an old peasant who has lived on the sandbar for nearly half a century, a witness to the transformation of this barren beach into a rich oasis, and a person who has personally experienced the transformation from a landlord's slave to a state cadre, is a wealthy man on this oasis. Last year alone, he earned more than 500 yuan, his wife and daughter added woolen sweaters, changed new quilts, and he himself put on a new cotton jacket.

The great achievements of the Great Leap Forward have deeply educated the people on the island. They firmly believe that in order to quickly and fundamentally change the appearance of the island and the country, we must hold the banner of the General Line higher, accelerate the pace of the Great Leap Forward, and run the people's commune better.

In the past few days, I have traveled to every corner of this oasis. I have seen how the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has been transformed into a huge material force here. The phrase "high-speed development of production" has become the mantra of every resident on the island. In the rice fields where rice is harvested, in the sheds where poultry is raised, by the ponds where fish seedlings are raised, and next to the tractors that are plowing the land, people are talking about the high-speed development of production, the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the bumper harvest of late rice this year, and the greater leap forward next year. …

Next year will be a year for the people of Coral Sand to continue to show their skills. In this year, the area for planting early rice on this oasis will increase by 50% compared to this year's 480 mu. In addition, 800 mu of wasteland that has accumulated in recent years will be reclaimed. Now, the island already has more than 8,000 ducks, more than 1,300 chickens, and more than 800 pigs; next year, they will strive to increase the number of livestock and poultry they raise to an average of 200 per household; in this year, they will also demolish the low and dilapidated thatched huts and build brand-new and spacious new houses. In addition, they also plan to build a ring-island road along the dike. Crossing the oasis, build two intersecting avenues. At that time, this emerald-like river oasis will be more beautiful and more lovable. At that time, people who come to the oasis will have an even greater feeling of being in a fairyland.

Yes, Coral Sand, this beautiful river oasis, is a paradise on earth that appeared in the 1950s. However, isn't this paradise on earth only appearing on this small oasis? No, under the sunshine of the General Line for Socialist Construction, isn't everywhere in our great and vast land as beautiful as a fairyland? Coral Sand is just one of the countless beautiful places. It is exactly:

Fairyland is more than just Coral Sand,
The east wind and rising sun shine all over the world;
The landscape is fortunate to add new colors,
Spring city is full of flying flowers!

    珊瑚沙
    峻青
    这儿是钱塘江心的一片绿洲。它的名字叫珊瑚沙。
    如果说钱塘江像一条银色的长带的话，那么，这珊瑚沙就是镶在这银色长带上的一颗小巧玲珑的翡翠宝石。
    这是一片多么美丽富裕的绿洲啊，简直是人间的仙境，我感到非常幸福，因为此刻我正生活在这人间的仙境里。
    看吧，那钱塘江的银色巨流，环绕着绿洲滚滚东去。沿着江岸，宽阔而漫长的堤坝，像一道绿色的锦屏，把绿洲紧紧地抱住。长堤上面，婆娑多姿的垂柳，在风中轻轻地摆动，长长的柳丝，温柔地拂拭着洲上人家的屋顶；长堤下面，是一片绿茵茵的草地和发着银光的池塘，草地上，成群的牛羊在吃草，池塘里，无数的鸭鹅在嬉游；长堤里面，是一片无垠的金黄色的稻田，从江上吹来的风，掠过稻田，荡起了粼粼的金黄色的波浪。……
    现在，正是收割晚稻的季节，自从党的八届八中全会发出了反右倾鼓干劲的伟大号召以后，一个轰轰烈烈的新的生产高潮，在这片江心绿洲上波涛汹涌地掀起来了。悬挂在柳树上的扩音器里，日夜播送着公社党委关于加紧抢收抢种为明年的大跃进打好基础的鼓动口号，热火朝天的劳动竞赛在进行着。田野上，到处是忙碌的人群，到处是愉快的歌声，镰刀在沙沙地响，打谷机在呼呼地叫，远处，在那收获后的稻田上，传来了雷鸣般的隆隆声，那儿是女拖拉机手在驾着铁牛翻耕播种。……
    在清晨的阳光下面，我听着这一片巨大而紧张的声响，感到了万分的激动。这是多么令人兴奋的声响啊！从这交响乐般的声响里，我仿佛听到了一个高大无比的巨人向前迈进的脚步声。这脚步声，听起来是多么熟悉啊！在艰苦的抗日战争期间，我听到过它；在激烈的解放战争中，我听到过它；在国民经济恢复的年月里，我听到过它；在社会主义改造和社会主义建设的日子里，我听到过它。而特别是大跃进以来，这声音，就更加巨大、更加响亮了。
    这是多么令人振奋的声音啊！我们的祖国，我们的事业不就是在这令人振奋的声音中一日千里地飞跃前进吗？珊瑚沙，这仙境般的绿洲，不就是一个很好的明证吗？
    生产队长袁祖富，指着面前一片茂密的稻田告诉我，在这儿，解放前亩产不到百斤的沙地上，解放后连年丰收。特别是在去年大跃进里，总产量一跃而飞腾到平均亩产四百八十斤，达到了前年产量的三倍。而今年早稻的产量比去年又增加了155％。现在的晚稻，虽然还没有全面的计算，但完全可以肯定：一定又大大地超过了早稻。
    这个数字，对于那些不了解珊瑚沙的历史的人来说，也许是引不起怎样的注意吧？可是，它却使我感到了很大的惊奇。因为我知道，这片富裕的幽美的绿洲，四十年前，还是一片荒无人烟的贫瘠的沙滩。那时候，白茫茫的江水，日夜在冲刷着沙滩的边沿，特别是在秋季洪汛到来的时候，横冲直闯的洪水，就在沙洲上到处泛滥。那时候，沙洲上除去野鸭水鸟和芦苇野草之外，没有任何生物。1914年，贫农俞锦忠来到这里，成了沙洲上的第一个居民，不久，走投无路的袁祖富一家七口和另外一些穷弟兄们也陆续来到了这里。他们在高一些的地方，搭起了窝棚，在芦苇丛中，开出了田地。可是，四十多年来，这沙洲上的薄地，给予人们的东西却非常之少，每年顶多一亩产七、八十斤，有时却一斤都收不到，因为洪汛一来，辛苦一年的劳动成果就全部付诸东流了。因此，沙洲上的人们，始终是挣扎在风雨飘摇的艰险环境中。漫长的四十多年过去了，沙洲的荒凉面貌没有发生任何变化，沙洲居民的悲惨命运也没有得到任何改变。一直到解放前夕，这儿还仅是一个二十户人家、一百多个居民的荒凉的沙洲。
    解放后的第二年，人民政府就拨出巨款，沿着江岸筑起了三道围堤，挡住了不驯顺的江水和横冲直闯的洪汛。以后，又领导洲上的人们组织了互助组、合作社，给荒凉贫瘠的沙洲争来了第一次丰收。从此以后，沙洲的面貌，就一天天的起了变化。可是，巨大的变化，还是在1958年——中国人民高举着总路线的红旗轰轰烈烈大跃进的一年。在这一年里，沙洲上的人们欢天喜地的加入了人民公社，和孤洲以外的广大农民弟兄联成了一体，于是，他们的力量更加雄伟了。在这一年里，他们在通往陆地的江峡里，修起了一道坚固的水闸。这水闸，控制了江水，使得它再也不能随意的侵犯洲上的居民，而且还得老老实实地为居民们服务了。人们兴奋地把这水闸称做“跃进闸”。紧连着跃进闸，人们又筑了一条高高的宽宽的大路，这路，从绿洲的深处，一直通到江的那边，和陆地连成了一起。从此，洲上的人民到陆地上去，再也用不着摆渡了。人们高兴地把这条路叫做“幸福路”。
    幸福路，这是一个多么动听、确切而又意味深长的名字啊！
    这条路，不仅是从绿洲的深处通向大陆，而且也从洲上人们的心里，通向了北京，通向了毛主席，通向了党中央。这路，不是别的，就是社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社。
    正是这条路，才使得洲上的人们，在这么短短的时间内，平地登天的达到了富裕的境地。现在，这儿已经是一个有着七十多户人家的绿洲了。四百多洲上的居民，过着他们祖先做梦都想不到的幸福生活。现在他们耕田有拖拉机，灌溉有抽水机，吃饭有公共食堂，这个食堂今年春天曾经抗住了那股不大不小的歪风，一直坚持了下来，伙食办得很好，社员人人满意。他们的孩子，有托儿所照顾，他们再也不会像他们的爸爸妈妈那样，在大潮汛到来的日子里，蹲在倒塌的窝棚前面，看着那卷走他们的稻谷的滚滚洪水伤心的流泪，绝望的呼喊了。且不要说孩子吧，就是那些青年小伙子，也早已忘记那悲惨的过去了，现在，他们许多人，出门的时候，都骑着雪亮耀眼的自行车。……
    袁祖富，这个在沙洲上生活了将近半个世纪的老农民，这个贫瘠的沙滩变成了富裕的绿洲的见证人，这个从地主的奴隶变成了国家的干部的亲身经历者，就是这片绿洲上一个富有的人。去年一年，他就收入了五百多元，妻子、女儿都添上了毛线衣、换了新棉被，他自己也穿上了新棉袄。
    大跃进的伟大成果，深刻地教育了洲上的人们，他们坚定地相信：要迅速地根本地改变洲上和国家的面貌，只有把总路线的旗帜举得更高，把大跃进的步伐迈得更快，把人民公社办得更好。
    几天来，我走遍了这片绿洲的每一个角落，我看到，党的八届八中全会的号召，在这里是怎样变成了巨大的物质力量。“高速度的发展生产”这句话，已经成了洲上每一个居民的口头禅。在收割稻谷的田畈上，在饲养家禽的栏棚里，在养殖鱼苗的池塘边，在翻耕土地的拖拉机旁，到处都听到人们在谈论着高速度的发展生产，谈论着党的八届八中全会的号召，谈论着今年晚稻的丰收，谈论着明年更大的跃进。……
    明年，将是珊瑚沙的人们继续大显身手的一年。在这一年里，这片绿洲上播种早稻的面积，将要比今年的四百八十亩增加50％。此外，还将开垦出八百亩近年来淤积出来的荒地。现在，洲上已经有了八千多只鸭子，一千三百多只鸡，八百多头猪；明年，他们饲养畜禽的数目要争取增加到每户平均二百只；在这一年里，他们还将拆掉低矮破旧的茅屋，盖起崭新宽敞的新居。另外，还准备沿着堤坝，修起一道环洲大路。横穿绿洲，修起两条交叉的大道，到那时候，这翡翠般的江心绿洲，就将更加美好，更加可爱了。到那时候，来到绿洲上的人们，将更有一种身历仙境的感觉了。
    是的，珊瑚沙，这美丽的江心绿洲，是一个出现在二十世纪五十年代的人间仙境。然而，这人间的仙境，岂仅是出现在这一片小小的绿洲上吗？不，在社会主义建设总路线的阳光照耀下，我们的伟大而辽阔的国土上，哪里不都是像仙境般的美好呢？珊瑚沙，只不过是这无数美好的地方当中的一个而已。正是：
    仙境何止珊瑚沙，
    东风旭日遍天涯；
    江山有幸添新色，
    春城无处不飞花！
