    Raise One Banner High, Ten Thousand Banners Flutter

    The water management experience of Dongxiang County is very good; it is a banner that the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee has erected on the water conservancy front. The county's basic experience is to rely on the people's commune, a social organization with strong vitality and unparalleled superiority, to vigorously launch mass movements, be self-reliant, and thus achieve such great results on the water conservancy front from the winter of 1958 to the spring of 1959: the construction of ten medium-sized reservoirs irrigating more than 10,000 mu each, and thirty-two small-sized reservoirs irrigating between 1,000 and 10,000 mu each, thereby enabling 70% of the county's farmland to achieve self-flowing irrigation. Precisely because of this, this year the county's agricultural production has achieved an even greater bumper harvest than the Great Leap Forward of 1958, with total grain output increasing by more than 40% and yield per unit area increasing by 50%. This is a remarkable achievement.

    Vigorously launching mass movements is our fundamental method for building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Wherever mass movements are carried out well, production and construction undertakings will be lively and vigorous. Wherever mass movements are not carried out well, production and construction undertakings will progress slowly, or even be stagnant.

    How can we ensure that mass movements develop wave upon wave? An important lesson is: raise the red flag, set up pacesetters, and rapidly popularize advanced experiences to become the wealth of all the people. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee's timely raising of the banner of Dongxiang County, "raise one banner high, ten thousand banners flutter," will greatly promote the development of mass movements on the water conservancy front in various places. At present, under the brilliant guidance of the Party's General Line and the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the whole country is opposing right-leaning tendencies and encouraging enthusiasm. The broad masses are embarking on the winter production front of water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, etc., with unprecedentedly high labor enthusiasm, determined to continue to work hard this winter and spring. In this situation, how to further organize the masses' labor enthusiasm to push the movement forward is a very important task for leaders. Raising red flags and setting up pacesetters is one good method.

    In any region and in any work, there will always be some advanced individuals and units whose work is done more, faster, better, and more economically. They have created many good experiences. These are our pacesetters, our banners. We should be good at discovering these advanced units and advanced individuals, summarizing their experiences, and popularizing their experiences so that their advanced production levels and advanced working methods become the production levels of society and everyone's working methods. Especially when the masses have already been mobilized, everyone is striving to be upstream, and everyone is learning from the advanced, the leader's timely erection of a banner gives the masses a goal to strive for and a model to learn from, and can push the movement to a new climax more quickly.

    In order to achieve greater achievements in water conservancy construction this winter and next spring, and in order to prepare for the continued leap forward in agricultural production next year, comrades engaged in rural work, while leading the masses in your area to learn from the experiences of other places, also raise the red flag of your own area and unit high!

    一旗高举万旗飘
    东乡县的治水经验很好，它是江西省委在水利战线上树起的一面旗帜。这个县的基本经验，是依靠人民公社这个具有强大生命力和无比优越性的社会组织，大搞群众运动，自力更生，所以能够在1958年冬到1959年春在水利战线上获得了这样巨大的成绩：建成了十座灌溉万亩以上的中型水库，三十二座灌溉万亩以下千亩以上的小型水库，从而使全县70％的耕地实现了自流灌溉。正因为这个原故，今年这个县的农业生产获得了比大跃进的1958年更大的丰收，粮食总产量增加四成多，单位面积产量提高了五成。这是一件了不起的大事。
    大搞群众运动是我们多快好省地进行社会主义建设的根本方法。什么地方的群众运动搞得好，什么地方的生产建设事业就进行得有声有色，轰轰烈烈。什么地方群众运动搞得不好，什么地方的生产建设事业就进展迟缓，甚至冷冷清清。
    怎样才能使群众运动一浪推一浪的不断发展呢？一条重要的经验就是：举红旗，树标兵，把先进经验迅速推广开，成为全体人民的财富。江西省委及时地举起东乡县这面旗帜，一旗高举万旗飘，这将会大大促进各地水利战线群众运动的发展。现在，全国各地在党的总路线和八届八中全会决议的光辉照耀下，反右倾、鼓干劲，广大群众正以空前高涨的劳动热情走上了水利、积肥等冬季生产战线，决心继续大干一个冬春。在这种情况下，怎样把群众的劳动热情进一步组织起来，使运动向前发展，这是领导者的一个十分重要的任务。举红旗、树标兵，就是其中的一个好方法。
    在任何地区、任何工作中，总会出现一些先进人物和单位，他们的工作做得又多又快又好又省，他们创造了很多很好的经验，这就是我们的标兵，我们的旗帜。我们应该善于发现这些先进单位，先进人物，总结他们的经验，推广他们的经验，使他们的先进的生产水平和先进的工作方法成为社会的生产水平和大家的工作方法。特别是在群众已经发动起来，人人争上游，个个学先进的时候，领导者及时地树起旗帜，就使群众有了前进的目标和学习的榜样，就能够更快地把运动推向新的高潮。
    为了使今冬明春的水利建设取得更大成就，为了给明年农业生产继续跃进做好准备，农村工作的同志们，在你们领导本地区群众学习外地经验的同时，也把自己地区、单位的红旗高高举起吧！
