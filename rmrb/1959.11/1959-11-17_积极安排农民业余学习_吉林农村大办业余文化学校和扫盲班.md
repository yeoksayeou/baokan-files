    Actively Arrange for Peasants' After-Work Study;
    Jilin Rural Areas Vigorously Establish Spare-Time Cultural Schools and Literacy Classes

    (Our Dispatch) A surge of literacy and spare-time cultural learning has now formed in the broad rural areas of Jilin Province.

    Through studying and implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, local Party committees and cultural and educational departments, from top to bottom, examined the right-leaning conservative thinking in the literacy and peasants' spare-time cultural education work, criticized the erroneous thinking that literacy and spare-time cultural education work could not be inserted because production was busy and the "wait and see" and "take it slow" mentality, and further recognized the unprecedented improvement of the political awareness of the broad masses of commune members and their enthusiasm for actively seeking to eliminate illiteracy and improve their cultural level. According to the recent "Decision on Launching a New Upsurge in Eliminating Illiteracy and Carrying Out Peasants' Spare-Time Education in This Winter and Next Spring" by the Jilin Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, adhering to the principle of walking on two legs, while vigorously establishing peasants' spare-time cultural schools, various localities have widely organized study classes, study groups, and decentralized learning forms of individual tutoring, carrying out literacy and spare-time cultural education work. Now, people's communes and management districts in various localities have universally established peasants' spare-time cultural center schools suitable for the production and life needs of commune members, and using them as the core, they have linked up various decentralized learning organizations, so as to bring the mass cultural learning movement to be established on the basis of regular persistence and consolidated improvement. According to incomplete statistics, the number of people in the province's rural areas who are organized to study culture has increased to 600,000. For example, the people's communes in the four regions of Changchun, Jilin, Siping, and Tonghua have established 296 central people's schools, basically achieving one in each commune. Jilin City also convened a regional conference on peasants' literacy and spare-time cultural education, summarizing past literacy experiences and solving specific problems in running schools, which greatly promoted the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres in running schools. Wang Hongxin, director of the Dashulinzi Management District of the Shuiqueliu Commune in Shulan County, was unwilling to take the lead in organizing commune members to study in the past. After studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, he raised his understanding, actively organized people's schools, and took the lead in registering for study.

    In order to ensure the elimination of remaining illiteracy and the completion of peasants' spare-time cultural education tasks, cadres of people's communes, management districts, and production teams at all levels are actively grasping learning while grasping production, ideology, and life. In order to strengthen leadership over literacy and spare-time cultural education work, various counties have also established education committees and research offices, organizing rural school teachers to actively assist civilian teachers in carrying out teaching activities. Yushu, Nongan, and other counties trained more than 2,500 civilian teachers during the slack season and held symposiums for civilian teachers to exchange teaching experiences. Yongji County also recently held training courses, and the first phase has trained 2,600 civilian teachers. Various counties have also made proper arrangements for the time for literacy and peasants' spare-time cultural learning. For example, the Peasants' Spare-Time Center School of Fanjiatun People's Commune in Huaide County divides the year into six stages: winter, spring plowing preparation, spring plowing, summer weeding, slack season, and autumn harvest, and stipulates the learning time according to the specific production busy and slack situations in each stage. In order to speed up the elimination of illiteracy among Party members, League members, and cadres, Yongji County has opened full-time study classes for cadres above the management district level. The first phase of more than 100 people has already started classes. (Zhang Kaixin)

    积极安排农民业余学习
    吉林农村大办业余文化学校和扫盲班
    本报讯　目前，一个扫盲和业余文化学习热潮，已在吉林省广大农村形成。
    各地党委和文教部门通过学习和贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，自上而下地检查了扫盲和农民业余文化教育工作中的右倾保守思想，批判了认为生产忙，扫盲和业余文化教育工作插不进去和“等一等”、“慢慢来”的错误思想，进一步认识到广大社员政治觉悟空前提高，积极要求脱盲和提高文化水平的热情。根据中共吉林省委和省人委最近“关于在今冬明春掀起扫除文盲和开展农民业余教育新高潮的决定”，贯彻两条腿走路的方针，在大办农民业余文化学校的同时，各地广泛组织了学习班、学习组、和个人之间包教包学的分散学习形式，开展扫盲和业余文化教育工作。现在，各地公社和管理区已经普遍建立了适合社员生产、生活需要的农民业余文化中心学校，并以它为核心，把各个分散的学习组织联结起来，做到以点带面，使群众性的文化学习运动建立在经常坚持和巩固提高的基础上。据不完全统计，全省农村有组织地学习文化的人数已增加到六十万人。像长春、吉林、四平、通化四个地区的人民公社建立的中心民校已有二百九十六所，基本做到每个公社都有一所。吉林市还召开了全地区的农民扫盲和业余文化教育会议，总结过去扫盲经验，解决办学中的具体问题，大大促进了基层干部办学的积极性。舒兰县水曲柳公社大树林子管理区主任王洪信，过去不愿意带头组织社员学习，学习党的八届八中全会文件之后，提高了认识，积极组织民校，并且带头报名参加学习。
    为了保证扫除剩余文盲和完成农民业余文化教育任务，各人民公社、管理区和生产队的干部在抓生产、思想、生活的同时，也积极抓学习。各县为了加强对扫盲和业余文化教育工作的领导，还成立了教育委员会和研究室，组织农村学校教师积极辅导民师开展教学活动。榆树、农安等县在挂锄期间即训练了二千五百多名民师，并召开了民师座谈会，交流教学经验。永吉县最近也举办了训练班，第一期已培训出二千六百名民师。各县对扫盲和农民业余文化学习的时间也做了妥善安排。如怀德县范家屯人民公社的农民业余中心学校，把一年分为冬季、备耕、春耕、夏锄、挂锄、秋收等六个阶段，按照各个阶段生产忙闲的具体情况，规定学习时间。永吉县为了加快扫除党、团员和干部中的文盲，开办了管理区以上干部的脱产学习班。第一期一百多人已经开学上课。（张开欣）
