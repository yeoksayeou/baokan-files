    Polyphonic Electronic Organ Can Play Twelve Timbres
    China's first polyphonic electronic organ has recently been successfully trial-produced by the Yingkou Northeast Musical Instrument Factory.
    This organ uses electron tubes instead of reeds, and uses multiple sets of multi-harmonic oscillators to generate audio-frequency electrical oscillations. After voltage amplification and power amplification, the electrical energy is converted into pleasant musical sounds by a loudspeaker. This type of electronic organ can change various tones by appropriately adjusting the voltage, and can play twelve timbres such as violin, clarinet, and flute.

    复音调电子琴能演奏十二种音色
    我国第一架复音调电子琴，最近由营口市东北乐器厂试制成功。
    这架琴是用电子管代替簧片，由多组多谐振荡器产生音频电振荡，经过电压放大与功率放大，再用扬声器将电能转换成悦耳的乐音。这种电子琴只要将电压加以适当的调整，就能变化多种音调，奏出小提琴、黑管、横笛等十二种音色。
