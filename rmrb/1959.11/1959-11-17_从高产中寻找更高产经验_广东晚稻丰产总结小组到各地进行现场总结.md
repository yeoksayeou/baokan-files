From High Yields, Seeking Even Higher Yield Experiences
    Guangdong Late Rice Bumper Harvest Summary Team Conducts On-Site Summaries in Various Locations

    (Our newspaper's Guangzhou dispatch, 16th) Guangdong Province achieved a bumper harvest of late rice this year. In order to conscientiously summarize the bumper harvest experience of this year's late rice, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee extracted a group of experts and technical cadres from provincial agricultural science and technology departments to form a late rice bumper harvest experience summary team, which went to various locations to conduct on-site summaries together with local cadres and the masses. For more than half a month, this team has traveled all over the province, conducting actual reaping and measurement everywhere to summarize experience, and is currently delving into key areas to conduct further summaries.

    The results of the team's actual reaping and measurement show that in various parts of Guangdong, whether in the plains or mountains, on the mainland or islands, and whether in areas with better or worse conditions, late rice has achieved large-scale balanced bumper harvests, with significant increases in both total output and yield per unit area compared to last year's late rice. Moreover, many large areas of high-yield fields have emerged in various locations.

    The large-scale balanced increase in late rice production in various locations is the result of resolutely implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture. In the team's preliminary summary, it affirmed several major technical measures for increasing late rice production: rational close planting, deep plowing to improve the soil, the use of improved varieties, cultivating strong seedlings, early transplanting, and strengthening management.

    The facts of increased late rice production show that close planting is a major measure for implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" and achieving increased production. In the dozens of acres of high-yield fields actually reaped by the team, all those with a yield of 1,000 catties per mu had between 250,000 and 350,000 ears per mu. Without reaching this number of ears, it would be difficult to achieve a yield of 1,000 catties per mu. Hainan Island was originally the lowest-yielding area in the province. The main reason why the average yield per mu of late rice this year has caught up with some areas on the mainland is that it adhered to reasonable close planting specifications, strived for a greater number of ears, and vigorously grasped field management on this basis. Therefore, based on a large amount of material, this team believes that in Guangdong, it is generally best to implement reasonable close planting with specifications such as 3x5, 3x6, 3x7, and 4x6, with a total number of about 300,000 ears per mu, which would better guarantee a yield of 1,000 catties per mu.

    Deep plowing to improve the soil and rational fertilization are also fundamental measures for increasing production. According to the team's investigation, fields with a yield of 1,000 catties per mu were mostly plowed to a depth of eight inches to one foot, the soil contained 3% organic matter, the base fertilizer was sufficient, and sufficient topdressing fertilizer was applied, with a relatively rational ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. According to a comparative observation of the soil, it was found that after deep plowing and soil improvement, the soil structure changed greatly: the original topsoil layer of three inches was grayish-yellow, but after deep plowing and soil improvement, the topsoil layer of five inches was black; the original hardened soil now has a honeycomb shape; the original firm and dry soil is now loose and moist, and microbial activity has also increased. This change is greatly beneficial to the growth of rice. At the same time, according to investigations in various places, deep plowing to a depth of about eight inches is not a difficult task, and it can be done by using a double plow method.

    Improved varieties are a prerequisite for increasing production. The large-scale growth balance and rare lodging phenomenon of late rice in Guangdong this year is closely related to the use of improved varieties, in addition to other factors. The Chaoshan area has done a good job in popularizing improved varieties, and the field management is relatively meticulous, so the yield is also higher than in other areas. Some communes in Kaiping County have used all improved varieties, and the late rice yield is higher than in the past, and the historical lodging phenomenon has been eliminated. After comprehensive observation, this team has affirmed several improved late rice varieties that can be popularized throughout the province, and requires all localities to do a good job in spike selection of improved varieties during the autumn harvest.

    Persistently doing a good job in cultivating strong seedlings, early transplanting, managing early and managing well, and a series of other tasks has also played a great role in increasing late rice production. The Chaoshan area has been a high-yielding area in the past, and the yield of late rice this year is even higher, because it has always paid attention to cultivating strong seedlings and has a high level of management. This year, the average number of grains per ear of late rice here is about 20 more than in other areas. Early transplanting is also very important. The Shaoguan area, where the growing season of late rice was originally shorter, completed transplanting late rice before the Beginning of Autumn this year, one season earlier than in previous years, and avoided the cold dew wind during the heading and flowering period. The spike setting and grain filling were better than in previous years, making the yield of late rice catch up with and exceed that of early rice. Field management after transplanting is also very important. The seeds of late rice on Hainan Island are of poor quality, and the seedlings are very tender and weak, but because they were transplanted more densely, and later they vigorously grasped management, especially changing the historical habit of not paying attention to topdressing, and applying more topdressing fertilizer, which achieved significant results.

    Responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee listened to the preliminary summary report of the late rice bumper harvest experience summary team and believed that with the launch of the anti-Rightist rectification movement throughout the province, the socialist general line education movement in rural areas, and the great improvement of the awareness and enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses, coupled with the experience of this year's late rice bumper harvest as guidance, as long as we start from now to work hard to prepare for water, soil, fertilizer, seeds and other tasks, we will definitely be able to achieve an even greater bumper harvest in rice production next year.

    从高产中寻找更高产经验
    广东晚稻丰产总结小组到各地进行现场总结
    本报广州16日电　广东省今年晚稻获得大丰收。为了认真总结今年晚稻的丰收经验，中共广东省委从省属农业科学技术部门抽调一批专家和技术干部，组成晚稻丰产经验总结小组，分赴各地和当地干部、群众一起进行现场总结。半个多月来，这个小组跑遍全省好些地方，到处进行实割、实测，总结经验，目前正深入重点，作进一步的总结。
    这个小组实割、实测的结果，说明广东各地，无论是平原或是山区，大陆或是海岛，也无论是条件较好或是条件较差的地区，晚稻都是大面积平衡丰产，总产量和单位面积产量都比去年晚稻有很大的增加。而且各地还出现了不少大面积高产田。
    各地晚稻获得大面积平衡增产，是坚决贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的结果。在这个小组的初步总结中，肯定了晚稻增产的几项主要技术措施：合理密植、深耕改土、采用良种、育壮秧、早插、加强管理等。
    晚稻增产的事实表明，密植是贯彻“八字宪法”、实现增产的一项主要措施。这个小组实割的数十亩高产田中，凡亩产达千斤的，每亩穗数都在二十五万到三十五万穗之间，没有达到这个穗数的就难以达到亩产千斤。海南岛原来是全省最低产的地区，今年晚稻平均亩产量所以会赶上大陆一些地区，主要是由于坚持合理的密植规格，争取到较多的穗数，并在此基础上狠狠抓好田间管理。由此，这个小组根据大量材料认为：在广东地区实行合理密植，一般以三乘五、三乘六、三乘七、四乘六等规格为好，每亩总穗数达到三十万穗左右，亩产千斤就较有保证。
    深耕改土和合理施肥，也是增产的根本措施。据小组的调查，凡是亩产千斤的田，深翻大多在八寸到一尺，土壤中含有机质3％，基肥充足，还施足了穗肥，氮磷钾的比例也较合理。根据对土壤的对比观察，发现在深耕改土以后，土壤结构变化很大：原来表土层三寸呈灰黄色的，深耕改土后表土层五寸呈黑色；原来板结的，现在呈蜂巢状；原来土壤坚实、干燥的，现在变为疏松、湿润，微生物活动也增强了。这种变化大大有利于水稻的生长。同时，据各地调查，土壤深翻八寸左右并不是一件困难的事，采用套犁的办法就可以办到。
    良种是增产的前提。广东今年晚稻大面积生长平衡又很少倒伏现象，除了其他因素以外，和采用良种有极大关系。潮汕地区由于良种普及工作做得较好，加上田间管理比较细致，所以产量也比别的地区高。开平县一些公社由于全部采用良种，晚稻产量比过去高，而且消灭了历史上的倒伏现象。这个小组在全面观察之后，肯定了几个可以在全省范围内普及的晚稻良种，并要求各地在秋收中做好良种的穗选工作。
    坚持做好培育壮秧、早插、管早管好等一系列工作，对晚稻增产也起了很大的作用。潮汕地区过去所以成为高产地区，今年晚造产量更高，就是因为向来就注意培育壮秧和有较高的管理水平。今年这里的晚稻每穗平均粒数比别的地区约多二十粒左右。早插的关系也很大，原来晚稻生长期较短的韶关地区，今年晚稻在立秋前插完秧，比往年提早一个季节，在抽穗扬花期避过了寒露风，结穗结粒情况比往年好，使晚造产量赶上并超过早造。插秧后的田间管理也非常重要。海南岛晚稻的种子较差，秧苗也很嫩弱，但由于插得较密，以后又一股劲地抓好管理，特别是改变历史上不重视追肥的习惯，追施了较多的穗肥，收到显著的效果。
    省委负责同志听了晚稻丰产经验总结小组的初步总结汇报，认为在全省开展反右倾的整风运动，农村开展社会主义总路线教育运动，广大干部和群众的觉悟和干劲都大大提高，加上有了今年晚稻丰产的经验作指导，只要从现在开始努力作好水土肥种等各项准备工作，明年一定可以在水稻生产上实现一个更大的丰收。
