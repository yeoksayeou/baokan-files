Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 3rd: After overfulfilling the summer grain purchase task, Henan Province has also overfulfilled the autumn grain (excluding sweet potatoes) purchase task. The sweet potatoes are also about to be harvested, and the farmers are stepping up slicing and drying them, striving to complete the sales plan as soon as possible. Kaifeng Prefecture has made the fastest progress in the purchase work, and the purchase plans for autumn grain and sweet potatoes have been overfulfilled.
	This autumn, Henan actively opposed Rightism and spurred enthusiasm, overcoming the idea of “the advanced suffer losses and the backward gain advantages” that existed among some cadres, and regarded the autumn grain purchase and delivery work as an important part of the production increase and conservation movement. The province's farmers broke the convention of waiting until the end of the entire autumn harvest to start delivering grain, starting grain delivery to the granaries seventy days earlier than last year. The quality of the grain entering the granaries is good, with the vast majority being medium to high-grade grain.
	While vigorously grasping the autumn grain purchase, various localities have paid attention to doing a good job in distribution, and widely carried out education on planned grain use and economical grain use, implementing the principles of fixed quantity per person, meal tickets, and saving for oneself in public canteens, and arranged the lives of commune members.
	Xinhua News Agency, Xining, November 3rd: The people's communes in Qinghai Province, which have achieved another bumper harvest this year, under the slogan of "Don't forget the Communist Party in a bumper harvest, quickly deliver grain, deliver good grain, and support socialist construction," had overfulfilled the plan for selling grain this year by October 30th. The quality of the grain that has already been stored in the granaries has basically reached the national standards after inspection by the grain department.
	Early, fast, and good are the salient features of this year's grain purchase work in Qinghai Province. Qinghai Province's grain output this year has increased compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, providing a basis for completing and overfulfilling the grain purchase task. After the autumn harvest began, the production teams of the people's communes formed various specialized teams, simultaneously harvesting, threshing, selling, and transporting grain, setting off one upsurge after another of grain sales and delivery to the granaries.
	Party committees at all levels in Qinghai Province have grasped the purchase work early, tightly, and meticulously. The province, prefectures, counties, and people's communes have all established grain and oil purchase offices or headquarters, led by the Party committee secretaries. Many responsible cadres from prefectures and counties went deep into the communes to publicize the purchase policies to the commune members and lead the grain and oil purchase work. Various localities also widely carried out red flag competitions to promote the work of grain storage. While purchasing grain, various localities also properly arranged the lives of commune members.

    正确贯彻征购政策　合理安排社员生活
    河南青海完成秋粮征购任务
    新华社郑州3日电　河南省在超额完成夏粮征购任务以后，又已超额完成了秋粮（不包括红薯）的征购任务。红薯也即将收获完毕，农民们正在加紧切片晒干，争取早日完成出售计划。开封专区征购工作的进度最快，秋粮、红薯的征购计划都已经超额完成。
    今年秋季，河南各地反右倾、鼓干劲，克服部分干部中存在的“先进吃亏、后进沾光”的思想，把秋粮征纳工作作为增产节约运动的一项重要内容。全省农民打破历年来等秋收全部结束后才开始交售粮食的常规，比去年提前七十天开始送交粮食入库。入库的粮食质量良好，绝大部分是中上等粮。
    各地在大抓秋粮征购的同时，注意做好分配工作，并且广泛开展计划用粮、节约用粮的教育，在公共食堂中贯彻执行以人定量、凭票就餐、节约归己的原则，安排了社员生活。
    新华社西宁3日电　今年又获得大丰收的青海省各人民公社，在“丰收不忘共产党，快交粮、交好粮，支援社会主义建设”的口号下，到10月30日已经超额完成今年交售粮食的计划。已经入库的粮食，经过粮食部门检验，质量基本上达到了国家规定标准。
    早、快、好，是青海省今年粮食征购工作的显著特点。青海省今年的粮食产量比大跃进的1958年又有增加，为完成和超额完成粮食征购任务提供了基础。秋收开始后，各人民公社的生产队就组成了各种专业队，边收割、边打碾、边交售、边运送，掀起一个又一个的售粮和送粮入库高潮。
    青海省各级党委对征购工作抓得早，抓得紧，抓得细，省、州、县和各人民公社，都成立了粮油征购办公室或指挥部，由党委书记挂帅；不少州、县的负责干部深入公社，向社员宣传征购政策，领导粮油征购工作。各地还广泛地开展红旗评比竞赛促进入库工作。在征购粮食的同时，各地还妥善安排了社员生活。（苗地插画）
