Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 20th: According to TASS, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded its discussion on the cessation of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons testing on the evening of the 19th and passed two proposals by an overwhelming majority.

    One proposal passed by the committee was submitted by the delegations of Austria, Sweden, and Japan. This proposal calls on countries possessing nuclear weapons to continue to refrain from atomic testing. The proposal also expresses the hope that major powers will, with greater effort, reach an agreement to stop these tests in the shortest possible time. Seventy-six delegations voted in favor of this proposal, while the delegations of France and Afghanistan abstained.

    Another proposal was a joint proposal from twenty-four countries (mainly Asian and African nations). This proposal was more specific than the first. It pointed out that concluding an agreement on the cessation of nuclear and thermonuclear tests under effective international supervision is a matter of extreme urgency. The United Nations General Assembly also hopes that major powers can conclude this agreement in the near future and calls on all countries to no longer conduct atomic tests. Sixty delegations voted in favor of this proposal. Only the French representative voted against it, and seventeen delegations abstained, including the United States and Britain.

    The results of the voting and the process of the debate, in which representatives from forty countries spoke, demonstrate how urgent it is to actively resolve this major international issue. With the exception of a very few representatives, almost all representatives who participated in the discussion of this issue demanded a permanent cessation of the testing of weapons of mass destruction.

    In his speech, Soviet representative Kuznetsov advocated a permanent cessation of nuclear testing. He pointed out that stopping testing would immediately produce the effect of greatly improving and strengthening the international situation, creating more favorable conditions for implementing thorough measures in disarmament.

    Kuznetsov recalled that the Soviet Union had twice decided not to resume nuclear explosions in the Soviet Union last year and this year. Only if Western countries resume testing would the Soviet Union consider itself no longer bound by this guarantee. Kuznetsov emphasized that if other countries also agree to the Soviet initiative and undertake such obligations, the issue of stopping nuclear testing will be finally resolved.

    Kuznetsov concluded by saying that the Soviet Union, as a participant in the Geneva three-nation talks, sincerely strives for the success of the conference for the benefit of all mankind and will make every effort to conclude an agreement on the cessation of all nuclear weapons testing as soon as possible.

    The speech by the French representative, Jules Moch, was markedly different from the speeches of other representatives. On the one hand, he cast doubt on scientific materials regarding atomic radiation, and on the other hand, he insisted that the nuclear weapons tests planned by France posed no danger to humanity. He implied that the French government did not consider itself bound by any obligations.

    The speech by the US representative, Lodge, was also significantly different from the prevailing sentiment in the committee during the discussion of this issue. Referring to the US assurance that it would not resume nuclear testing at least until the end of this year, Lodge said that the US government's future position on this issue "will depend on the situation that may develop." He said that voluntarily refraining from testing indefinitely without international supervision would not promote an agreement on the permanent cessation of such testing. Lodge also said that a temporary cessation of testing "conflicts with the requirements of national security." It is therefore no accident that the US delegation abstained from voting on the twenty-four-nation proposal.

    联大政委会通过提案  要求停止核武器试验
    苏联主张永久停止核试验
    法国投反对票美国和英国弃权
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会19日晚上结束了关于停止核武器和热核武器试验问题的讨论，并以绝大多数票通过了两个提案。
    委员会通过的一个提案是由奥地利、瑞典和日本代表团提出的，这个提案呼吁拥有核武器的国家继续放弃原子试验。提案还表示希望，各大国以更大的努力在尽可能短的时间内达成停止这些试验的协议。投票赞成这个提案的有七十六个代表团，法国和阿富汗代表团弃权。
    另一个提案是二十四国（主要是亚非国家）的联合提案。这一提案比第一个提案具体一些。这一提案指出，缔结关于在有效的国际监督下停止核试验和热核试验的协议是极其迫切的事情。联合国大会还希望，各大国能够在最近的将来缔结这一协议，并呼吁所有国家不再进行原子试验。有六十个代表团赞成这一提案。投票反对的只有法国代表，十七个代表团弃权，其中包括美国和英国。
    投票的结果和有四十个国家代表发言的辩论的过程表明，积极解决这一重大国际问题是多么迫切的事情。除了极少数的代表之外，几乎所有参加这一问题讨论代表都要求永久停止大规模毁灭性武器的试验。
    苏联代表库兹?佐夫在发言时主张永久停止核试验。他指出，停止试验将立即会产生大大改善和健全国际局势的效果，为实行在裁军方面的彻底措施创造更有利的条件。
    库兹?佐夫追述说，苏联在去年和今年先后两次通过了不在苏联恢复核爆炸的决定。只有在西方国家恢复试验的情况下，苏联才认为自己不受这个保证的约束。库兹?佐夫着重指出，如果其他国家也同意苏联的倡议并承担这样的义务的话，那么，停止核试验的问题将会得到最后解决。
    库兹?佐夫最后说，苏联，作为参加三国日内瓦谈判的国家，从全人类的利益出发，真诚地致力于使会议成功，并将尽一切努力，能够更快地缔结停止一切核武器试验的协定。
    法国代表儒勒·莫克的发言同其他代表的发言截然不同。他一方面使人怀疑关于原子辐射的科学材料，同时又硬说，法国计划进行的核武器试验对人类没有任何危险。他暗示说，法国政府不认为自己会受到任何义务的约束。
    美国代表洛奇的发言同委员会在讨论这一问题时的主导情绪也有着显著的区别。洛奇在提到美国曾保证至少在今年年底不恢复核试验时说，美国政府今后在这一问题上的立场“将取决于可能形成的情况”。他说什么在没有国际监督的情况下，自愿不定期停止试验的做法并不会促进达成关于永久停止这种试验的协议。洛奇还说，暂时停止试验“同国家安全的要求是相抵触的”。由此可见，美国代表团在表决二十四国提案时弃权的做法并不是偶然的。
