Visiting the Hero City

	Leningrad
	We arrived in Leningrad, the sacred place of the October Revolution, with immense excitement.

	In the dense forest by the Gulf of Finland, we saw where Comrade Lenin, disguised as a grass cutter, stayed to evade the pursuit of the bourgeois reactionary government. The refuge consisted of a thatched hut, a tea pot hanging on a wooden frame, and an axe, saw, and long-handled scythe for cutting grass and splitting firewood. Twenty-some steps to the left of the hut, nestled among the trees, was a tree stump. Comrade Lenin wrote “State and Revolution” right here.

	We immediately fell into deep thought. We followed in the footsteps of Comrade Lenin and his disciples and comrades-in-arms from forty years ago, braving the coastal chill, watching and thinking for an immeasurable amount of time. It felt as if the great teacher was right beside us, making us reluctant to leave.

	We saw the cruiser Aurora, which fired the first shot at the Winter Palace during the October Revolution, and several cannons that contributed to the proletarian revolution, as well as photos of the vanguard fighters of that time who are still alive today. We saw the armored car at the Finland Station, where Comrade Lenin stood and spoke to the insurgent workers and soldiers. We saw the Great Hall of the October Revolution. It was here that Comrade Lenin announced to the workers, peasants, and soldiers of the entire Soviet Union, and to the world, that "All power to the Soviets!" We saw the October Revolution building, Comrade Lenin’s command office for the October Revolution. This simple and unadorned little room, no more than thirty square meters, was shockingly simple: a single bed, two sofas covered in coarse cloth, an old telephone, and a very small table with a kerosene lamp for use during power outages. Comrade Azarov, a lieutenant general from the Soviet Veterans Committee who accompanied us, and Colonel Dugaeru, told us: "Comrade Lenin wrote more than 140 articles guiding the revolution, including 'Peace and Land,' in this simple little room."

	After seeing all this, my heart churned violently, and my eyes welled up with tears. Although I was born eight years after the October Revolution, at this moment I seemed to see the image of the great teacher Lenin before my eyes, as if Lenin's voice was thundering, as if Lenin's pen was flying. Following this never-fading voice, following this never-drying ink, millions upon millions of people are advancing bravely in the direction pointed out by this great teacher.

	After revisiting the past of Leningrad, we also saw its happy present. The responsible comrades of the City Soviet introduced to us that Leningrad is now advancing towards the realization of the great seven-year plan for building communism. In the grand ranks of builders, there are one million veteran revolutionary soldiers, recipients of awards for the defense of Leningrad. They were heroes in battle in the past, and today they are capable people in construction. Leningrad has forty-one universities and colleges, with 100,000 students, and four hundred and fifty-seven middle schools, with 400,000 students. More schools will be added in the future, especially boarding schools. In elementary schools and children's palaces, we saw fourth-grade students begin to study various aspects of construction according to their interests, carefully researching on lathes, at fitter's benches, next to piles of radio parts, next to various piles of minerals, and under microscopes. These future little masters use their nimble hands to make all kinds of precise things.

	Every corner of the revolutionary holy land is filled with deep friendship for the Chinese people. In the water turbine factory, workers told us that of the thirty-nine giant water turbines produced by this factory this year, nineteen were to support our country's socialist construction and equip our hydroelectric and thermal power plants. Like Chinese workers, they quickly and well assembled a machine as a gift for the tenth anniversary of our country's founding.

	In the Palace of Culture, we were surrounded by people and could hardly get out the door. Upon entering, a huge report meeting on the revolutionary struggle history of the Chinese Communist Party was being held in a large hall. When we arrived at the singing practice room, the ballet rehearsal room, the swimming pool, the gymnastics hall, and the drama hall, the young people immediately stopped their rehearsals upon seeing us and hurriedly organized performances for us. When we were about to leave the singing hall, three young people took my hand and sang "The East is Red, the Sun Rises..." in Chinese to express their deep affection for the Chinese people. The children in the swimming pool, although their practice time had ended, came in again to perform diving, water polo, and various styles of swimming upon seeing us, while constantly shouting "China!" "Friendship!"

	The flowers of friendship are blooming everywhere, and our hearts are deeply immersed and intoxicated in its rich fragrance...

	Stalingrad

	As a soldier who once participated in the anti-fascist war, I have always been thinking about Stalingrad for more than ten years. Today, I have finally come here!

	More shrapnel?! Or more rubble and broken tiles?! More cannon fire?! Or more people's breathing?! More gunpowder smoke?! Or more wind, sand, and soil?!

	This is how people describe the devastation of the city by the heinous fascist bandits from July 1942 to February 1943. This description is by no means an exaggeration. Veteran revolutionary soldiers in Stalingrad confirmed this when they told us about the eight-month-long bloody battle of Stalingrad in front of a huge model. At that time, Hitler concentrated his most elite troops, 400,000 men, and frantically attacked Stalingrad. All the houses in the city were completely reduced to rubble and broken tiles, and almost all the land in the city was turned over. But the heroic Soviet Red Army, the heroic people of Stalingrad, defended Stalingrad and defended the Volga River. In the end, Hitler's 400,000 elite troops were completely wiped out in the face of heroic Stalingrad. Marshal Paulus, who was once rampant, also became a prisoner of the Red Army.

	"Heroes! Stalingrad!" I shouted in Russian with excitement as I stood in front of the hero statue on Mamayev Kurgan. At this moment, the veteran revolutionary soldiers of China and the Soviet Union couldn't help but shake hands and embrace each other tightly.

	The heroic Soviet people quickly swept away the traces of Hitler's trampling from the land. Not only that, Stalingrad has become newer, larger, and more magnificent than before, standing in golden splendor on the banks of the Volga River. Lenin Avenue, named after Lenin, is sixty-eight kilometers long. Tall buildings stand on both sides, and a verdant park runs through the center of the street for sixty-eight kilometers.

	We visited the Stalingrad Hydropower Station, the world's largest at the time, and the first lock of the Lenin Canal. The dam across the Volga River is five kilometers long. Twenty-two giant hydro-generators generate 2.5 million kilowatts of electricity. As the Volga River surges, thousands of machines sing, and ten-thousand-ton freighters float.

	We stood on the dam, overlooking the Volga Reservoir. I exclaimed excitedly to myself: "So big! This is not a reservoir, it's simply a sea!"

	The translator, Comrade Alyosha, smiled and said to me: "Yes! People call it the Volga Sea."

	While we were fascinated by the Volga, Comrade Sherov suggested that we see the Volga City first and then watch the opening of the lock and the departure of ships.

	We crossed the dam and drove not far, and a brand new and exquisite new city was presented before us. It is separated from Stalingrad by only one river and connected by the dam.

	This new city was born in just a few years with the opening of the Lenin Canal, the construction of the power station, and the construction of new types of factories. Everything in this new city is modern. Sports fields, theaters, workers' sanatoriums, and cultural palaces for the working people are all available. Housing is provided to the people free of charge, and each worker can take a twenty-one-day vacation at a sanatorium each year. Steel towers stand around the city, and tall buildings are being installed wall by wall and half-roof by half-roof, like children stacking blocks.

	When we returned to the dam, it was the time when ten-thousand-ton freighters were opening the lock and setting sail. Our eyes were fixed on the huge iron gate that blocked half the sky. "What kind of machinery will be used to start such a huge iron gate?" I was thinking, when I saw the girl sitting in the driver's room, with her big eyes, giving us a slight smile. Like pinching a needle, she gently pressed the button with her thumb, and the thousands-of-tons iron gate opened slowly and peacefully. The ten-thousand-ton freighter roared and sped away.

	The Volga Sea has brocade-like waves, and the Volga River roars and sings; the electric welding sparks on the dam are like thousands upon thousands of intersecting lightning bolts, like the sun radiating light in all directions. Trains and cars come and go like shuttles, speeding and busy; hundreds of steel tower crane arms, like forests, swing their mighty iron arms, rushing back and forth...

	Seeing this scene, the translator, Comrade Alyosha, couldn't help but hum, "Volga Boatman's Song," and I joined in the chorus. Comrade Azarov, the lieutenant general who accompanied us, put his arm around my shoulder and laughed and laughed. This old hero, over sixty years old and with many merits, also started singing. After singing, Comrade Azarov and I said almost the same sentence at the same time: "The era of the Volga Boatman's Song is gone forever! 'Soviet power plus electrification is communism!' The great Lenin's prediction is being realized."

	At this moment, a laugh of friendship erupted on the dam. This laughter, along with the rushing sound of the Volga River, along with the roaring sound of machines, along with the light of electric welding radiating in all directions, flew into the sky, flew to a far, far away place.

    谒英雄城
    曲波
    列宁格勒
    我们怀着万分激动的心情，来到列宁格勒，十月革命的圣地。
    在芬兰湾旁的密林里，我们看了列宁同志为躲避资产阶级反动政府的追捕，化装成割草人的所在。避难的地方有着一所茅棚，一个吊在木架上的煮茶锅，和割草劈柴用的斧子、锯子、长柄大镰刀。在茅棚左边二十几步，群树环抱中有一个树墩。列宁同志，就是在这写成了“国家与革命”。
    我们立即陷入沉思中了。我们踏着列宁同志和他的门生、战友们四十年前的足迹，冒着海滨上的风寒，看着！想着，也不知有多长的时间。好像伟大的导师就在我们身边。使我们不舍得离开。
    我们看了十月革命时向冬宫开第一炮的阿芙洛尔号巡洋舰和数门有功于无产阶级革命的大炮，以及当年战斗的先锋、今天依然活着的同志们的照片。我们看了当年芬兰车站上，列宁同志站在上面，向起义的工人、士兵讲话的铁甲车。我们看了十月革命的大礼堂。列宁同志就是在这里向全苏联的工人、农民和士兵，向全世界宣布，“一切政权归苏维埃”。我们看了十月革命大楼，列宁同志指挥十月革命办公室。这个不过三十平方米的简单而朴素的小房间，简单的实在令人吃惊：一张单人床，两张用粗格布套套着的沙发，一架古老的电话机，一张很小的桌子，上面还摆着一盏准备停电时用的煤油灯。陪同我们的苏联老革命军人委员会的阿扎洛夫中将和杜盖鲁上校告诉我们：“列宁同志就是在这个简朴的小房子里，写了‘和平与土地’等一百四十多篇指导革命的文章。”
    看了这些，我的心剧烈地翻腾，我的眼圈也湿润起来。虽然我是在十月革命后八年才生的，可是此刻我仿佛看到伟大导师列宁的形象就在眼前，仿佛列宁的声音在雷鸣，仿佛列宁的笔在飞舞。随着这永不逝灭的声音，随着这永不干枯的墨迹，千千万万人，勇往直前，走向这位伟大的导师所指给的方向。
    重温了列宁格勒的过去，我们又看了它的幸福的今天。市苏维埃负责同志向我们介绍，现在列宁格勒，正在为实现伟大七年建设共产主义计划向前迈进。在建设者宏大的行列里，有一百万老革命军人，列宁格勒保卫战的受奖者。他们以往是战斗中的英雄，今天是建设中的能人。列宁格勒全市有四十一座大专学校，学生有十万人，有四百五十七座中学，学生有四十万人。今后还要增加若干学校，特别是寄宿学校。我们在小学里，少年宫里，看到四年级的小学生，就开始根据自己的爱好，在车床上，在钳工案子上，在无线电机零件堆旁，在各种各样的矿石堆旁，在显微镜旁，精心钻研各方面建设的学问。这些未来的小主人，用他那玲珑的双手，作出各种各样精密的东西来。
    革命圣地的每个角落都洋溢着对中国人民深厚的友谊。在水轮汽轮工厂里，工人告诉我们，这个工厂今年出产的三十九台巨型水轮汽轮机中，有十九台是支援我国社会主义建设、装备我们的水力、火力发电厂的。他们还和中国工人一样，又快又好地装出了一台机器，为我们建国十周年献礼。
    我们在文化宫，被人们拥簇着几乎走不出大门。一进门，在一个大厅里，正在举行一个庞大的报告会，讲中国共产党革命斗争史。我们到了歌咏练习馆、芭蕾舞排练馆、游泳馆、体操馆、话剧馆，青年们见我们一到，便立即停止他们的排练，急忙组织为我们表演。在歌咏馆临出大门的时候，三个青年拉着我的手，用中国话唱起：“东方红，太阳升……”来表达他们对中国人民的深情厚意。游泳馆的孩子们，本来他们的练习时间已结束，可是一见到我们，又进来为我们表演了跳水，水球，和各种姿式的游泳，同时还不断呼喊着“中国”！“友谊”！
    友谊的花朵四处开放，我们的心，长久地浸润沉醉在它浓郁的芳香里……。
    斯大林格勒
    作为一个曾经参加过反法西斯的战士，十几年来，我总在惦念着斯大林格勒。今天，我终于来到这里了！
    弹片多？！还是碎砖碎瓦多？！炮声多？！还是人的呼吸声多？！硝烟多？！还是风沙泥土多？！
    这是人们形容1942年7月到1943年2月，万恶的法西斯强盗对这座城市摧毁的惨状。这个形容丝毫没有夸张。斯大林格勒的老革命军人在庞大的模型前，向我们讲述斯大林格勒八个月的大血战的情况时证实了这点。当年希特勒集中了最精锐的部队四十万人，猖狂地向斯大林格勒进攻。全城的房子完全变成了碎砖碎瓦，全城的土地几乎完全被翻过来。可是英雄的苏联红军，英雄的斯大林格勒人民，保卫了斯大林格勒，保卫了伏尔加河。最后希特勒的四十万精锐，在英雄的斯大林格勒面前，全军复没了。疯狂一时的鲍罗斯元帅，也成了红军的俘虏。
    “英雄！斯大林格勒！”我站在玛玛耶夫骨鲁罕的英雄铜像前，激动的用俄语呼喊了一声。这时我们中苏的老革命军人，都情不自禁的互相紧紧的握手，拥抱起来。
    英雄的苏联人民，很快的把希特勒铁蹄践踏的痕迹从土地上一扫而光。不仅如此，斯大林格勒变得比以往更新，更大，更雄伟了，金光灿烂的屹立在伏尔加河畔。以列宁的名字命名的大街，长达六十八公里。高大的楼房耸立两侧，碧绿的公园，纵贯六十八公里的街心。
    我们参观了当今世界之冠的斯大林格勒水电站和列宁运河第一闸口。横卧在伏尔加河的拦河大坝，长达五公里。二十二个巨型水轮发电机，发出二百五十万瓩的电量。随着伏尔加河的汹涌奔腾，千百台机器在歌唱，万吨的巨轮在浮游。
    我们站立在大坝上，眺望伏尔加水库。我兴奋的自语着：“好大！这不是水库，简直是海！”
    翻译阿辽沙同志笑了笑向我道：“是的！人们都叫它伏尔加海。”
    我们正在迷恋着伏尔加的时候，谢辽夫同志提议要我们先看伏尔加城，再看开闸起航。
    我们过了大坝，行驶不远，一座崭新玲珑的新城市，就呈现在我们面前，它和斯大林格勒只有一河相隔，通坝相连。
    这座新城，是在几年内，随着列宁运河的开辟，随着发电站的兴建，随着新型工厂的建设，而诞生的。这个新型城市，一切都是近代化的。运动场、大戏院、工人疗养院、劳动人民文化宫，一应俱全。住宅全是无偿的供人民居住，每个工人每年可在休养所休养二十一天。环城四周，钢塔林立，在一面墙一面墙的，半个屋顶半个屋顶，像小孩搭积木一样的在安装着高大的楼房。
    当我们再回到大坝时，正是万吨巨轮，开闸起航的时候，我们的眼睛紧盯着那挡住半边天的大铁门。“这样巨大的铁门，将用什么机械来起动呢？”我正想着，只见坐在司机室的那位姑娘，张着两只大眼睛，向我们微微一笑，她像捏动绣针一样，大拇指向电钮轻轻的一捺，千吨重的铁门，安详地徐徐启开。万吨巨轮一声吼鸣，长驱而去。
    伏尔加海浪花似锦，伏尔加河奔腾歌唱；大坝上电焊火花，像千千万万交加的闪电，像光芒四射的太阳。列车、汽车往来如梭，飞驰奔忙；上百架树林似的钢塔旋臂吊，摇动着它力大无穷的铁臂，在来回奔忙……
    看到这种情景，翻译阿辽沙同志不觉哼唱起：“伏尔加船夫曲”来，我也随着合唱，陪同我们的阿扎洛夫中将，挽着我的肩膀，笑着笑着，这位年过六旬功绩累累的老英雄也唱起来了。唱毕，我和阿扎洛夫中将，几乎同时说出了一句话：“现在伏尔加船夫曲的年代，已经一去不再返了！‘苏维埃政权，加电气化，就是共产主义！’伟大列宁的预言，正在实现着。”
    这时，大坝上发出了友谊的欢笑。这笑声随着伏尔加河的奔流声，随着??的机器声，随着电焊四射的光芒，飞向天空，飞向遥远遥远的地方。
