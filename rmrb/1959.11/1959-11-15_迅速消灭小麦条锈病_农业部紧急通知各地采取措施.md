Xinhua News Agency Report: The Ministry of Agriculture issued an urgent notice on the 9th, requiring regions where wheat stripe rust has occurred to take measures to quickly eradicate it.

The notice stated: This year, the winter wheat sowing work has been carried out with great effort in various regions, sown in a timely manner, with large areas, and good quality, and the wheat seedlings are growing strongly, laying a good foundation for continued wheat harvests next year. However, according to recent reports from various regions, wheat rust has begun to occur in thirteen counties including Fengxiang in Shaanxi Province, the Pingliang area of ​​Gansu Province, and parts of Shandong, Hebei, Xinjiang and other provinces and autonomous regions. Disease transmission centers have already appeared. In severely affected wheat fields, some seedlings have turned from green to yellow, and a layer of yellow powder appears on the ground, seriously affecting the normal growth of the current wheat. In order to protect wheat seedlings during the winter, and ensure a bumper wheat harvest next year, all regions must, on the basis of the great victory achieved in opposing Right-leaning tendencies and going all out, combine winter wheat field management work, quickly mobilize the broad masses of commune members, and launch a high tide of "inspecting rust, preventing rust, and eradicating rust," resolutely eliminating rust disease during the wintering stage.

The notice said that according to the successful experience of Shaanxi and other provinces in eliminating stripe rust by adopting the strategy of "guarding three passes" (focusing on early-sown wheat fields before winter to eliminate overwintering sources of inoculum; focusing on transmission bases during the wheat's greening period to control disease transmission; focusing on low-lying areas during the booting stage for comprehensive protection), all regions must first grasp the first pass before winter, resolutely and thoroughly eliminate overwintering sources of inoculum. People's communes in all regions should organize rust inspection teams (or groups), designate specific personnel, divide areas and assign responsibilities, and search carefully, paying particular attention to early-sown wheat fields. And mobilize the masses to carry out a mass survey of "everyone inspecting rust" in conjunction with wheat field management, to ensure that "no field is missed, no row is overlooked," so as to grasp the disease situation accurately and in a timely manner to guide prevention and control.

In the prevention and control of stripe rust, it is necessary to implement a combination of manual and chemical methods. For single diseased leaves, use the method of burying the soil to cut the leaves to quickly eliminate the source of inoculum; for wheat in the disease transmission center, spray 3% ammonium sulfate solution or a one-to-one mixture of urine and water to kill the pathogens, and at the same time spray lime sulfur mixture for protection. Insert markers after prevention and control for review. The existing ammonium sulfate in various regions should be given priority for the prevention and control of rust.

    迅速消灭小麦条锈病
    农业部紧急通知各地采取措施
    新华社讯　农业部9日发出紧急通知，要求发生小麦条锈病的地区，采取措施，迅速扑灭。
    通知说：今年冬小麦播种工作，各地抓的紧，播的适时，种的多，种的好，麦苗生长茁壮，为明年小麦继续丰收打下了良好基础。但据各地最近汇报，小麦锈病已在陕西省凤翔等十三县、甘肃省平凉专区和山东、河北、新疆等省和自治区部分地区开始发生，并已出现传病中心，个别为害严重的麦田，部分麦苗由绿转黄，地面呈现一层黄粉，严重影响当前小麦正常生长。为了保护麦苗过好越冬关，确保明年小麦大丰收，各地必须在反右倾鼓干劲获得伟大胜利的基础上，结合冬季麦田管理工作，迅速动员广大社员，掀起一个“查锈、防锈、灭锈”运动的高潮，坚决把锈病消灭在越冬阶段。
    通知说，根据陕西等省在消灭条锈病上采取“守三关”（冬前抓早播麦田，消灭越冬菌源；小麦返青期抓传病基地，控制病害传播；孕穗期抓低湿地区，全面保护。）的成功经验，各地要首先抓紧冬前第一关，坚决彻底的消灭越冬菌源。各地人民公社应该组织查锈队（或组），指定专人，分片包干，细找细查，特别注意早播麦田。并发动群众结合麦田管理，开展“人人查锈”的群众性普查工作，做到“一块不丢，一行不漏”及时准确地掌握病情，指导防治。
    在防治条锈病时，要贯彻人工和药剂相结合的办法，对单片病叶采取埋土切叶的办法，迅速消灭菌源；对传病中心的小麦应喷撒3％硫酸铵水或一比一生尿水等杀伤病菌，同时喷布石灰硫黄合剂进行保护。防治后插上标记，以便复查。各地现有硫酸铵应优先用于防治锈病。
