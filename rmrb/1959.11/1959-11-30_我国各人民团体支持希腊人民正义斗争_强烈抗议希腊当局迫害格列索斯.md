Xinhua News Agency, 29th -- The person in charge of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace Defense issued a statement regarding the Greek authorities' repeated persecution of peace fighter Glezos, saying: "The Greek authorities, disregarding the firm opposition of the Greek people and the widespread protests of fair world opinion, have arbitrarily and repeatedly persecuted the well-known Greek patriot and world peace fighter Manolis Glezos, which has aroused great indignation among the broad masses of people in Greece and around the world. Everyone knows that Glezos is an outstanding son of the Greek people, a loyal defender of the interests of the Greek nation, and a courageous fighter against fascism and for the defense of world peace. No slander or framing can tarnish this hero who fights for truth and justice.

"The Greek authorities' conspiracy to persecute patriots is inseparable from its policy of violating the interests of the Greek nation and endangering world peace. Recently, the Greek government brazenly accepted the US rocket equipment for the Greek army, which was strongly opposed by the Greek people. It is very obvious that the Greek authorities' persecution of patriots aims to suppress the Greek people's growing just struggle to safeguard national independence, democratic freedom, and world peace, thereby paving the way for further reliance on US imperialism and the establishment of US rocket bases in Greece, threatening the security and peace of the Balkan region and the world.

"The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace Defense expresses strong protest against the Greek authorities' continued persecution of Greek patriots and peace fighters. The Greek authorities should immediately stop any persecution of Glezos and other patriots and immediately restore their freedom. The Chinese people, together with the peace-loving and justice-upholding people of all countries in the world, will firmly support the Greek people's struggle to safeguard national interests and state sovereignty and to strive for peace, democracy, and freedom. We firmly believe that final victory will surely belong to the Greek people."

Li Jiebo, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Issues a Statement

Condemning the Greek Authorities for Trampling on Democratic Freedom

Xinhua News Agency, 29th -- Li Jiebo, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, issued a statement today, strongly protesting the Greek authorities' persecution of Greek national hero and renowned peace figure Glezos.

Li Jiebo said: "The Greek authorities, brazenly disregarding the protests of the Greek and global public, have refused the appeal to revoke the unjust verdicts against Glezos and other patriots. At the same time, they cancelled the not-long-ago acquittal by the Athens Criminal Court in the case of Glezos and 'Dawn Daily' being accused of 'insulting the government', and will re-hear this case. Chinese workers are extremely angry at this new conspiracy by the Greek authorities and express strong protest."

Li Jiebo pointed out that Glezos is a Greek national hero and a famous peace fighter respected by the Greek people and the people and workers of the world. He demonstrated heroic spirit and dauntless courage in the struggle against Hitler's fascist rule and the aggression of British and American imperialism, and in the defense of national independence. The Greek authorities' persecution of Glezos and other patriots is a wanton trampling on democracy and freedom, which is intolerable to anyone.

Li Jiebo said: "All measures taken by the Greek authorities to betray national interests and suppress patriotic and democratic movements can only arouse more resolute resistance from the Greek people. Recently, the United States has stepped up its activities to establish rocket bases on Greek territory and arm the Greek army with atomic weapons. The Greek government has unreasonably rejected the proposal to establish a Balkan nuclear-free zone and to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Bulgaria, and is conspiring to participate in the establishment of a Mediterranean aggressive pact organization planned by the United States. All of these show that the Greek government is increasingly becoming a tool for the United States to pursue its war policy and exacerbate international tensions. The Greek authorities' attempt to suppress domestic opposition by persecuting Glezos and other patriotic and democratic figures will only further expose their reactionary features and become increasingly isolated among the people.

"We strongly protest the Greek authorities' refusal to revoke the unjust verdicts against Glezos and other patriotic and democratic figures, and resolutely demand that the Greek authorities immediately declare Glezos and other patriotic and democratic figures innocent and immediately release Glezos and other patriots."

Person in Charge of the Chinese Writers Association

Calls on World Public Opinion to Defend Glezos

Xinhua News Agency, 29th -- The person in charge of the Chinese Writers Association issued a statement today, saying that Chinese writers strongly protest the Greek authorities' persecution of Glezos. He said: "The Greek authorities recently not only refused the appeal to revoke the unjust verdicts against Glezos and other patriots, but also cancelled the acquittal by the Athens Criminal Court in the case of Glezos and 'Dawn Daily' being accused of 'insulting the government'. We Chinese writers strongly protest this despicable conspiracy by the Greek authorities to persecute patriots." "We once again solemnly protest to the Greek authorities. We shout: Glezos must be released immediately! We call on just world opinion to condemn the crimes of the Greek authorities and defend Glezos!"

Person in Charge of the All-China Journalists Association Expresses

Full Support for the Appeals and Protests of Greek and World Public Opinion

Xinhua News Agency, 29th -- The person in charge of the All-China Journalists Association issued a statement regarding the Greek authorities' continued persecution of Glezos, saying: "Chinese journalists strongly protest the Greek authorities' continued persecution of the famous Greek anti-fascist fighter and outstanding journalist Manolis Glezos, and demand the immediate restoration of Glezos's freedom."

The person in charge said: "In July this year, the Greek authorities sentenced Glezos to a long prison term on trumped-up charges. This unreasonable verdict aroused boundless anger and strong protest from world opinion. On the 23rd of this month, the Greek authorities brazenly disregarded the widespread protests from the Greek and world public and continued to reject the just demands for the restoration of freedom to Glezos and other democrats. The Greek authorities' new persecution of these patriots and anti-fascist peace fighters is a complete violation of the fundamental interests of the Greek people and democratic principles, and can only arouse broader and stronger opposition and protest from just world opinion.

"The various so-called 'crimes' imposed on Glezos by the Greek authorities are completely fabricated. As Greek former Prime Minister Tsaldaris rightly pointed out: 'Not a single word is true in the accusations against Glezos.'

"In order to defend human rights and uphold justice, all Chinese journalists fully support the appeals and protests of Greek and world public opinion, and demand that the Greek authorities immediately stop the persecution of Glezos and other democrats and immediately release them."

Person in Charge of the China Political Science and Law Association Points Out

The Verdict Against Glezos is Illegal

Xinhua News Agency, 29th -- The person in charge of the China Political Science and Law Association issued a statement today, saying that the Greek authorities' unreasonable deprivation of Glezos and other Greek patriots' right to appeal shows that "the Greek authorities disregard the dignity of the law, rudely trample on human rights, and adopt fascist means to carry out crazy suppression of patriotic and democratic figures." He said: "Chinese legal workers are deeply indignant at the illegal actions of the Greek authorities and express strong protest."

The person in charge of the China Political Science and Law Association pointed out that the Athens Military Court's heavy sentences imposed on Glezos and other Greek patriots in July this year on charges of "espionage" were completely illegal. He said: "As Greek just public opinion has pointed out, the 375th law, on which the trial of this case was based, which was left over from the fascist dictatorship era, is fundamentally 'contrary to the basic spirit of the Greek Constitution.' Moreover, the military court violated the provisions of Greek criminal law and criminal procedure law in many ways during the trial, undermining the law and infringing on the rights of the defendants. Therefore, the verdict made by the military court against Glezos and other Greek patriots is a completely illegal verdict fabricated on the basis of false accusations and perjury. The patriots such as Glezos who have been falsely accused and persecuted have every reason to demand the revocation of the illegal verdict of the original military court."

The person in charge said that the Greek authorities not only deprived Glezos and other patriots of their right to appeal, but also, after the Athens Criminal Court had already declared the defendants innocent in the case of Glezos and "Dawn Daily" being accused of "insulting the government," accepted the request of the prosecutor of the Athens Court of Appeal and cancelled this legal and fair verdict. "This clearly exposes the Greek authorities' conspiracy to deliberately persecute patriotic and democratic forces, not only to illegally continue to imprison Glezos and other patriots for a long time, but also to plan new and more barbaric persecutions. This is a rampant attack against justice, trampling on human rights, and against peace and democracy.

    我国各人民团体支持希腊人民正义斗争
    强烈抗议希腊当局迫害格列索斯
    我和大负责人正告希腊当局
    必须立即恢复格列索斯的自由
    新华社29日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会负责人就希腊当局一再迫害和平战士格列索斯发表谈话说：“希腊当局不顾希腊人民的坚决反对和世界公正舆论的普遍抗议，对希腊著名爱国者与世界和平战士曼诺里斯·格列索斯等一再进行无理迫害的专横行为，引起了希腊和世界各国广大人民极大愤慨。大家都知道格列索斯是希腊人民的优秀儿子，是希腊民族利益的忠诚维护者，是杰出的反法西斯、保卫世界和平的勇敢战士，任何污蔑和陷害都不能沾污这位为真理和正义事业而战斗的英雄。
    “希腊当局这种迫害爱国人士的阴谋，是同它所奉行的违反希腊民族利益与危害世界和平的政策分不开的。最近希腊政府悍然接受美国火箭装备希腊军队，受到希腊人民的强烈的反对。非常明显，希腊当局迫害爱国者的行为，目的在于镇压希腊人民不断增长的为维护民族独立、民主自由与世界和平的正义斗争，从而为进一步投靠美帝国主义和在希腊建立美国火箭基地铺平道路，威胁巴尔干地区和世界的安全与和平。
    “中国人民保卫世界和平委员会对希腊当局继续迫害希腊爱国者与和平战士的蛮横行为，表示强烈的抗议。希腊当局应该立即停止对格列索斯及其他爱国者的任何迫害，立即恢复他们的自由。中国人民将和世界各国爱好和平和维护正义的人民一起，坚决支持希腊人民为维护民族利益与国家主权、争取和平与民主自由的斗争。我们深信，最后胜利一定属于希腊人民。”
    我全总副主席李颉伯发表谈话
    谴责希腊当局摧残民主自由
    新华社29日讯　中华全国总工会副主席李颉伯今天发表谈话，强烈抗议希腊当局迫害希腊民族英雄、著名和平人士格列索斯。
    李颉伯说：“希腊当局悍然不顾希腊和全世界公众的抗议，竟拒绝要求撤销对格列索斯和其他一些爱国人士的不公正判决的上诉，同时取消了不久以前雅典刑事法庭对关于格列索斯和‘黎明日报’被控‘污辱政府’一案宣布被告无罪的判决，并将重新审理这一案件。中国工人对希腊当局这一新的阴谋感到极大的愤怒，并表示强烈的抗议。”
    李颉伯指出，格列索斯是受到希腊人民和全世界人民和工人尊敬的希腊民族英雄和著名的和平战士。他在反对希特勒法西斯统治和美、英帝国主义的侵略以及维护民族独立的斗争中，表现了英雄气概和大无畏的精神。希腊当局对格列索斯和其他爱国人士的迫害是对民主和自由的肆意摧残，这是任何人所不能容忍的。
    李颉伯说：“希腊当局出卖民族利益和镇压爱国民主运动的一切措施，只能激起希腊人民更加坚决的反抗。最近美国加紧进行在希腊领土上建立火箭基地的活动，用原子武器武装希腊军队，希腊政府无理拒绝了建立巴尔干无原子地区和与保加利亚缔结互不侵犯条约的建议，并阴谋参加美国一手筹划的建立地中海侵略公约组织的活动。所有这些都说明希腊政府正在日益成为美国推行战争政策与加剧国际紧张局势的工具。希腊当局企图用迫害格列索斯及其他爱国民主人士的办法来压制国内人民的反对，只会进一步暴露他们的反动面目，在人民中日益孤立。
    “我们强烈抗议希腊当局拒绝撤销对格列索斯等爱国民主人士的不公正判决，坚决要求希腊当局立即宣布格列索斯等爱国民主人士无罪，并立即释放格列索斯及其他爱国者。”
    我作家协会负责人
    呼吁世界舆论保卫格列索斯
    据新华社29日讯　中国作家协会责负人今天发表谈话说，中国作家强烈抗议希腊当局对格列索斯的横加迫害。他说：“希腊当局最近不但拒绝要求撤销对格列索斯和其他一些爱国人士的不公正判决的上诉，而且竟然取消了不久前雅典刑事法庭在格列索斯和
  ‘黎明日报’被控‘污辱政府’一案中宣告被告无罪的判决。我们中国作家对希腊当局这种迫害爱国人士的卑劣阴谋提出强烈抗议。”“我们再一次向希腊当局严正抗议，我们高呼：必须立即释放格列索斯，我们号召全世界的公正舆论起来谴责希腊当局的罪行，保卫格列索斯！”
    我全国新闻工作者协会负责人表示
    完全支持希腊和世界舆论的呼吁和抗议
    新华社29日讯　中华全国新闻工作者协会负责人为希腊当局继续迫害格列索斯，发表谈话说：“中国新闻工作者强烈地抗议希腊当局继续迫害希腊的著名的反法西斯战士和杰出的新闻工作者曼诺里斯·格列索斯，并要求立即恢复格列索斯的自由。”
    负责人说：“今年7月，希腊当局以莫须有的罪名判处格列索斯以长期徒刑。这个无理的判决，引起了全世界舆论无比的愤怒和强烈抗议。本月23日，希腊当局悍然不顾希腊和世界公众的纷纷抗议，继续拒绝了恢复格列索斯和其他一些民主人士的自由的正义要求。希腊当局对这些爱国者和反法西斯的和平战士的新的迫害是完全违反希腊人民的根本利益和民主原则的，只能激起全世界公正舆论的更广泛、更强烈的反对和抗议。
    “希腊当局加在格列索斯身上的种种所谓‘罪名’，完全是捏造的。正如希腊前首相曹达利斯公正地指出的：‘在对格列索斯的控告中，没有一个字是真话’。
    “为了保卫人权，伸张正义，全中国的新闻工作者完全支持希腊和世界舆论的呼吁和抗议，要求希腊当局立即停止对格列索斯和其他民主人士的迫害并立即释放他们。”
    我政法学会负责人指出
    对格列索斯的判决是非法的
    据新华社29日讯　中国政治法律学会负责人今天发表谈话说，希腊当局无理地剥夺格列索斯和希腊其他爱国人士的上诉权利，表明“希腊当局不顾法律的尊严，粗暴地践踏人权，采取法西斯手段对爱国民主人士实行疯狂镇压。”他说：“中国法律工作者对希腊当局的非法行为深为愤慨，并且表示强烈抗议。”
    中国政治法律学会负责人指出，雅典军事法庭今年7月以“间谍罪”判处格列索斯等希腊爱国人士以重刑是完全非法的。他说：“正如希腊公正舆论所指出，这个案件的审讯所根据的法西斯独裁统治时期遗留下来的第三百七十五号法律，根本是‘违反希腊宪法的基本精神的’。而且军事法庭在审讯过程中多方面地违反了希腊刑法和刑事诉讼法的规定，破坏了法律、侵害了被告人的权利，因此，军事法庭对格列索斯等希腊爱国人士所作的判决，完全是在诬告和伪证的基础上制造出来的非法判决。受诬陷迫害的格列索斯等爱国人士完全有理由要求撤销原军事法庭的非法判决。”
    负责人说，希腊当局不但剥夺了格列索列等爱国人士的上诉权利，而且对于雅典刑事法庭已经在格列索斯和“黎明日报”被控“污辱政府”一案中宣布被告无罪后，却接受雅典上诉法庭检察长的要求，取消了这一合法的公正判决。“这就十分明显地暴露了希腊当局蓄意迫害爱国民主力量的阴谋，不仅要非法地继续长期监禁格列索斯等爱国人士，而且还策划着新的更野蛮的迫害。这是违反正义，践踏人权，向和平与民主的猖狂进攻。
