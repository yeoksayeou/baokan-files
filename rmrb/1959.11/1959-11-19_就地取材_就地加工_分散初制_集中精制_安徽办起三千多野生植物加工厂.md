Relying on local materials, processing locally, decentralizing initial processing, and centralizing refining, Anhui Province has established more than 3,200 wild plant processing factories, basically forming a wild plant processing network within the province. In the first ten months of this year, these processing factories used wild plants to process more than 4,600 dan of oils, more than 3,500 dan of aromatic oils, more than 460 tons of tannin extract, more than 68,000 sacks, more than 22,400 dan of paper, more than 5,000 dan of wine, and more than 2,600 dan of maltose.

There are more than 2,600 kinds of wild plant resources that can be utilized in Anhui Province, with an annual output of approximately more than 80 million dan. Before processing and utilization, most of these abundant resources were discarded. Now, after the establishment of processing factories, the situation has greatly changed, and discarded materials have become valuable wealth. The large quantities of products manufactured have a very good effect on supporting industrial and agricultural production, meeting market needs, and supplying exports. For example, the tannin extract used for leather making has historically required importing 600 to 700 tons from other provinces. This year, due to the establishment of tannin extract processing factories, the amount imported from other provinces has been greatly reduced. More than 8,000 jin of camphor oil needed for pesticide production in various places are all supplied by the province. The spices needed for medicines, cosmetics, and foods manufactured in the province are mostly processed from wild plants. Some counties have used wild plant oils to produce soap.

The characteristics of wild plants are: many varieties, wide distribution, strong seasonality, and many are inconvenient to store. If the time for processing and handling is slightly delayed, they will deteriorate and become ineffective. According to these characteristics, relevant leaders in Anhui Province have given full play to the superiority of the people's communes, relied on the power of the communes to run factories, and established a number of wild plant processing factories based on the principles of procuring materials locally and processing locally. More than 90% of the existing processing factories in the province are run by people's communes; the products processed by people's commune factories account for more than 80% of the province's total product volume. In order to expand the processing volume of wild plants, so that the preliminary products processed by the people's communes can be well refined, and to facilitate the strengthening of technical guidance to the people's commune processing factories, the commercial, health, light industry, forestry and other departments of Anhui Province have also established more than 200 larger-scale processing factories with better equipment. In this way, a processing network has been formed.

In order to give full play to the role of the mass wild plant processing network, Anhui Province has done a lot of specific work. All localities have actively helped people's communes set up wild plant processing factories and solved the necessary equipment supply and labor arrangement problems. All localities have regarded the state-run wild plant processing factories as technical schools, organizing members of nearby people's communes to visit, intern, and learn production knowledge in the factories. Various localities have also held more than 80 on-site meetings and organized members of the people's communes to learn advanced experience and new product production technologies from other places. Through the above methods, the province has enabled more than 10,000 members of the people's communes to learn production technology. In this way, not only has the output of the people's commune processing factories been increased, but also the product quality is very good, and generally meets the needs of production and export.

### 就地取材　就地加工　分散初制　集中精制  安徽办起三千多野生植物加工厂

    就地取材　就地加工　分散初制　集中精制
    安徽办起三千多野生植物加工厂
    本报合肥18日电　安徽省根据“依靠群众，就地取材，就地加工，分散初制，集中精制”的原则，建立了三千二百多个野生植物加工厂，在省内基本上形成了一个野生植物加工网。今年头十个月，这些加工厂利用野生植物加工了四千六百多担油脂，三千五百多担芳香油，四百六十多吨栲胶，六万八千多条麻袋，二万二千四百多担纸张，五千多担酒，二千六百多担饴糖。
    安徽省野生植物资源可利用的有二千六百多种，年产量约八千多万担。在未加工利用以前，这些丰富的资源绝大部分是废弃掉了。现在，办起加工厂以后，情况有了很大的改变，废弃物资成了宝贵的财富；制成的大批产品，对支援工农业生产，满足市场需要，供应出口有很好的效果。如制革用的栲胶，历年来需要从外省调进六百吨到七百吨；今年由于办起了栲胶加工厂，从外省调进的数量就大大减少了。各地制农药需要的八千多斤樟脑油，全部由省内供给。省内制造的药品、化妆品、食品需要的香料，大部分是利用野生植物加工的。有些县利用野生植物油脂生产了肥皂。
    野生植物的特点是：品种繁多，分布面广，季节性强，而且有好些不便保管，加工处理的时间稍有拖延，就要变质失效。根据这些特点，安徽省有关领导方面，充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，依靠公社的力量办厂，根据就地取材、就地加工的原则，办起了一批野生植物加工工厂。全省现有的加工厂，90％以上是人民公社办的；人民公社加工厂加工的产品，占全省产品总量的80％以上。为了扩大野生植物的加工量，使人民公社加工的初制品能够很好的精制，又便于在技术上加强对人民公社加工厂的指导，安徽省商业、卫生、轻工业、林业等部门，也举办了二百多个规模较大、设备较好的加工厂。这样，就组成了一个加工网。
    安徽省为了充分发挥群众性野生植物加工网的作用，曾做了许多具体工作。各地都积极帮助人民公社举办野生植物加工厂，并解决必要的设备供应和劳力安排的问题。各地把国家办的野生植物加工厂当作技术学校，组织附近地区的人民公社社员到厂内参观、实习、讲解生产知识。各地还召开了八十多次现场会议，并组织人民公社社员到外地学习先进经验和新产品的生产技术。全省通过上述办法，使人民公社的一万多个社员学会了生产技术。这样，不仅提高了人民公社加工厂的产量，而且产品质量也很好，一般都符合生产和出口的需要。
