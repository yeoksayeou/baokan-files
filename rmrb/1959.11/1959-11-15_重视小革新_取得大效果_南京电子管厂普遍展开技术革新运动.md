Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 14th: The Nanjing Electronic Tube Factory has adopted the approach of "both embracing big watermelons and grabbing small sesame seeds," sparking a mass technical innovation movement in which everyone uses their brains, everyone thinks of solutions, everything is innovated, and everything is improved.

Some time ago, some employees of this factory believed that "small innovations have little potential," and were not interested in innovative technologies that could improve work efficiency by one or two times. They only wanted to engage in innovation activities that could improve efficiency by dozens or even hundreds of times. Some also thought that "production tasks are so tight, where is there time for innovation?" Apprentice workers felt that "we haven't mastered the technology yet, how can we innovate?" In response to these ideological situations, the factory's Party committee adopted methods such as presenting facts, calculating detailed accounts, and holding experience exchange meetings to open up the minds of the workers and masses, pointing out the direction of technical innovation that combines large, medium, and small-scale efforts.

Zhang Derong, from the manual assembly group of the Third Workshop, improved the method of welding isolation covers for special tubes, increasing work efficiency by 10%. This improvement may seem insignificant, but after full promotion, each process improved work efficiency by 10%, which could increase production by more than 550 tubes per day, worth more than 10,000 yuan. A veteran worker in the tool workshop changed to using silver blocks to process parts for a certain product. Although work efficiency only increased by half, the life of the mold was extended by 50%, and one-third of the steel was saved. After calculating the accounts of these "small" innovations, the workers said that the role of "small" innovations was indeed not small. They began to realize that many small innovations can converge into large innovations. One worker even wrote a poem for this: "High aims but low skills in innovation, empty thoughts without confidence. Focus on the process and use your brains, break superstitions and find the knack. Innovation blossoms, spring fills the courtyard, production targets rise day by day."

After the factory's Party committee mobilized the innovation enthusiasm of all the factory's employees, it further pointed out to the employees: anything that is beneficial to production, whether it involves processes, tools, equipment, technology, operation, or adjusting labor organization, even if it only improves work efficiency by 0.1 times, counts as innovation. As a result, the whole factory quickly launched a "four comparisons" competition of more suggestions, faster implementation, less money spent, and better results, forming a wave of innovation for everyone. In October, almost 60% or more of the apprentices achieved one to two innovation projects, both large and small.

While the mass technical innovation wave swept across the entire factory, the leadership, based on the characteristics of production, also regularly scheduled major key production technology issues for the entire factory each month, proposed innovation topics to the employees, and focused on grasping the innovation matching link so that both large and small innovations could play a role simultaneously.

Due to the extensive mobilization of the enthusiasm of the workers and masses for technical innovation, this factory received more than 20,000 innovation proposals in September and October alone, and more than 5,000 of them have been implemented, more than twice the total number from January to August.

### 重视小革新　取得大效果  南京电子管厂普遍展开技术革新运动

    重视小革新　取得大效果
    南京电子管厂普遍展开技术革新运动
    据新华社南京14日电　南京电子管厂采取“既抱大西瓜，又抓小芝麻”的做法，掀起了一个人人动脑筋、个个想办法，事事有革新、件件有改进的群众性技术革新运动。
    前些时候，这个厂的有些职工认为“小革新苗头不大”，对于提高工效一两倍的革新技术不感兴趣，尽想搞自动化、工效提高几十倍甚至几百倍的革新活动；也有人认为“生产任务这样紧，哪有时间搞革新”；学徒工则认为“我们技术还没有学到家，哪能搞革新”。针对这些思想情况，工厂党委采取摆事实、算细账、召开经验交流会等办法，打开职工群众思路，指出大中小并举的技术革新方向。
    三车间手工操作的装配小组张德容改进了焊特种管子隔离罩的方法，提高工效10％；这一改进看来作用不大，但是全面推广以后，每道工序都提高工效10％，每天可多增产五百五十多只管子，价值一万多元。工具车间老师傅改用银块方法加工某种产品的零件，虽然工效只提高半倍，但是模子的寿命却延长了50％，还节约了钢材三分之一。把这些“小”革新的账一算，工人都说“小”革新的作用实在不小，开始认识到许许多多小革新可以汇聚成为大革新的道理。有一个工人还为此写了一首诗：“眼高手低搞革新，空想一阵没信心。围绕工序动脑筋，破除迷信有窍门。革新花开春满庭，生产指标日日升”。
    厂党委把全厂职工的革新积极性调动起来之后，进一步向职工指出：围绕工序、工具、设备、工艺、操作、调整劳动组织等，只要对生产有利，即使工效提高零点一倍，都算革新。这一来，全厂很快掀起了比提得多、实现快、花钱少、效果好的“四比”竞赛，形成了人人搞革新的热潮。10月份，几乎60％以上的学工都实现了一项到两项大小革新项目。
    在群众性的技术革新浪潮漫卷全厂的同时，领导上又根据生产特点，每月排出全厂性生产技术上的重大关键，向职工提出革新课题，并且重点抓住革新配套这个环节，使大小革新同时发挥作用。
    由于广泛地调动了职工群众技术革新的积极性，这个厂在9、10两个月，就出现了革新建议两万多条，已经实现了五千多条，比1至8月份的总和还多一倍多。
