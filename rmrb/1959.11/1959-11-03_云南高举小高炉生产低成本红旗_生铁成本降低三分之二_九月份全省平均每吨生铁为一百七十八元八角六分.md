Kunming, November 2nd (Reporter Huang Changlu) – Yunnan Province's small blast furnace ironmaking costs, starting from the second quarter of this year, have already been reduced to below the state-stipulated target of 200 yuan per ton. In September, it further decreased to an average of 178 yuan, 8 jiao, and 6 fen per ton, nearly two-thirds lower than last year's pig iron cost, becoming a red banner for large-scale cost reduction in small blast furnaces nationwide.

    The majority of Yunnan Province's small blast furnaces were developed on the basis of the mass movement of the whole people running iron and steel. While the masses were engaged in large-scale iron and steelmaking last October, the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee, according to the principle of walking on two legs, combining indigenous and foreign methods, focused on building mechanized small blast furnaces. The Provincial Party Committee organized furnace modeling groups consisting of factory directors, veteran workers, and technicians, who went to various ironmaking sites to select and determine furnace types suitable for Yunnan's characteristics. At the same time, based on local resources, transportation, electricity, and technical capabilities, they made reasonable layouts for the construction sites of small blast furnaces. Subsequently, the province's machinery industry was organized to provide supporting equipment for the small blast furnaces. Because the Provincial Party Committee grasped the construction of small blast furnaces early and tightly, by February of this year, more than 100 small blast furnaces built throughout the province were officially put into production.

    Initially, due to incomplete equipment, unfamiliar techniques, and lack of management experience, costs were relatively high. The average cost of pig iron in the first quarter of this year reached more than 230 yuan per ton. Party committees and industrial leadership departments at all levels in Yunnan took many effective measures to reduce pig iron costs. First, they carried out technical transformations on the small blast furnaces in batches, universally replacing manual charging with winches, adopting parallel blower methods, increasing air volume, and ensuring fast charging. The installation of hot blast stoves and air ducts was improved, stabilizing the hot air temperature above 500 degrees. After the Yimen Iron Factory technically transformed its internal transportation system, it saved 28,000 workdays this year, saving 30,000 yuan in wages, reducing the cost of each ton of pig iron by eight yuan.

    The vast majority of workers in Yunnan's small blast furnaces only joined the ranks of the working class during last year's mass iron and steelmaking campaign. Although they learned some indigenous ironmaking techniques, they were completely unfamiliar with small blast furnaces. At the beginning of this year, the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee transferred a group of technical personnel from old steel plants to form a blast furnace start-up team, which toured various places to help check production preparations before start-up, guide charging, ignition, and start-up, so that production could be normal from the start. The Provincial Metallurgical Industry Department and various ironmaking plants ran short-term technical training classes, and frequently organized ironmaking plants to visit each other, exchange experiences, formulate operating procedures, and help new workers quickly master production techniques. Accidents gradually decreased, and the coke ratio was repeatedly reduced. In the first quarter of this year, the average coke ratio of small blast furnaces in the province was 1.213, which had dropped to 0.978 by September, and individual small blast furnaces even lowered it to 0.752. At the same time, the utilization coefficient was greatly improved. In the first quarter of this year, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in the province was 0.788, which had increased to 1.012 by September, with individual iron factories reaching as high as 1.68.

    Within less than a year of building the furnaces, each ironmaking unit had established a relatively complete set of enterprise management systems. By strengthening raw material management and carrying out ore dressing and ore roasting, the grade of raw ore was significantly improved. After ore dressing, the grade of raw ore at the Kunming Second Steel Plant increased from 57.87% to 67%. Each ironmaking unit absorbed workers to participate in enterprise management, established original records of production, statistics, and accounting, formulated raw material consumption quotas, and successively promoted economic accounting in workshops and teams, which greatly reduced enterprise management expenses and raw material consumption. The Yimen Iron Factory took various measures to reduce the loss rate of coke to 10%, which alone reduced the cost of each ton of pig iron by ten yuan.

    Due to the above measures, the cost of ironmaking in small blast furnaces throughout Yunnan Province decreased quarter by quarter and month by month. By the second quarter of this year, the cost per ton of iron had dropped from more than 230 yuan in the first quarter to 195 yuan, 8 jiao, and 1 fen, and in the third quarter to 195 yuan, 3 jiao, and 9 fen, of which September was 178 yuan, 8 jiao, and 6 fen, approaching the production cost of large and medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide.

    Small blast furnaces have played a huge role in Yunnan's steel production this year. By the end of September, the province had completed the state's annual pig iron plan ahead of schedule, of which pig iron produced by small blast furnaces accounted for 71%. The quality of pig iron is also very good. The pass rate in the first half of October reached over 97%, and the pig iron pass rate of Kunming First Steel Plant and Yimen Iron Factory reached 100%. Therefore, Yunnan's steel production plan for this year has also been completed 65 days ahead of schedule. From these facts, we see the profound results of the mass movement of the whole people making iron and steel in the Great Leap Forward last year, and we see how vigorous the vitality of the Party's series of policies of walking on two legs, combining large, medium, and small sizes, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, formulated in accordance with the general line of socialist construction, is.

    云南高举小高炉生产低成本红旗
    生铁成本降低三分之二
    九月份全省平均每吨生铁为一百七十八元八角六分
    本报昆明2日电　记者黄昌禄报道：云南省小高炉炼铁成本从今年第二季度起，已经降低到国家规定每吨二百元的指标以下，9月份更降低到平均每吨一百七十八元八角六分，比去年生铁的成本降低了将近三分之二，成为全国小高炉大面积降低成本的一面红旗。
    云南省的小高炉大部分是在全民大办钢铁的群众运动的基础上发展起来的。在去年10月群众性大炼钢铁的同时，中共云南省委根据土洋并举的两条腿走路的方针，就抓紧建设机械化生产的小高炉。省委组织了有厂长、老工人和技术人员参加的炉型造型团，到各炼铁现场选择和确定了适合云南特点的炉型。同时根据各地资源、交通、电力和技术力量等情况，对小高炉的建设地点作了合理的布局，随即组织全省机械工业为小高炉的设备进行配套。由于省委对小高炉的建设抓得早，抓得紧，到今年2月，全省建设的一百多座小高炉都正式投入了生产。
    最初由于设备不够完善，技术不熟练，缺乏管理经验等原因，成本是比较高的，今年第一季度平均每吨生铁成本达二百三十多元。云南各级党委和工业领导部门采取了许多有效措施降低生铁成本，首先是对小高炉分批进行了技术改造，普遍用卷扬机代替了人工上料，采用鼓风机并联的办法，加大了风量，保全风快料。改进了热风炉和风管的装置，使热风温度稳定在五百度以上。易门铁厂对厂内运输系统进行技术改造后，今年节约了两万八千个工，节约工资三万元，使每吨生铁的成本降低了八元。
    云南小高炉上的工人绝大部分是去年全民炼钢铁时才走进工人阶级队伍的，他们虽学到一些土法炼铁的技术，但对小高炉却完全陌生。今年年初，云南省委从老的钢铁厂抽调了一批技术力量组成一支高炉开炉队，巡回各地帮助检查开炉前的生产准备，指导上料点火开炉，使开炉就能正常生产。省冶金工业厅和各炼铁厂都开办了短期的技术训练班，并经常组织各炼铁厂互相参观交流经验，制订操作规程，帮助新工人迅速掌握了生产技术，事故逐渐减少，焦比一再降低。今年第一季度，全省小高炉平均焦比为一点二一三，到9月份已降低到零点九七八，个别小高炉更降低到零点七五二。与此同时，利用系数大大提高，今年第一季度全省小高炉平均利用系数为零点七八八，到9月份已提高到一点零一二，个别铁厂高达一点六八。
    在建炉不满一年的时间内，各炼铁单位已建立了一套比较完整的企业管理制度。由于加强了原料的管理，进行了选矿和矿石焙烧，使原矿品位显著提高。昆明第二钢铁厂经过选矿后，原矿品位由57.87％提高到67％。各炼铁单位都吸收工人参加企业管理，建立了生产、统计和会计的原始纪录，制订了原材料消耗定额，还陆续推行了车间和班组的经济核算，结果大大降低了企业管理费用和原材料的消耗。易门铁厂采取各种措施把焦炭的损耗率降低到10％，仅这一项，可使每吨生铁的成本降低十元。
    由于以上的措施，云南全省小高炉炼铁成本逐季逐月降低。到今年第二季度，每吨铁成本已由第一季度的二百三十多元降到一百九十五元八角一分，第三季度降到一百九十五元三角九分，其中9月份为一百七十八元八角六分，已接近全国大、中高炉的生产成本。
    小高炉在云南今年钢铁生产中发挥了巨大的作用。到9月底，全省已提前完成了全年生铁的国家计划，其中小高炉生产的生铁就占71％。生铁质量也很好，10月上半月的合格率达97％以上，昆明第一钢铁厂和易门铁厂的生铁合格率达到百分之百。因此，云南今年钢产计划，也已提前六十五天完成。从这些事实中，我们看到了去年大跃进中，全民大炼钢铁的群众运动产生了何等深远的结果，看到了党根据社会主义建设总路线而制订的大中小并举，土洋并举的一系列两条腿走路的方针，具有多么磅礴的生命力。
