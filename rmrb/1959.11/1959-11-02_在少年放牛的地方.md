At the Place Where a Boy Herded Cattle
Fu Guangyao, Apprentice at the First Tractor Factory

The site of this tractor factory is where I used to cut grass and herd cattle as a boy, and it is also the hometown of my ancestors. Now that "Dongfanghong" (East is Red) tractors are rolling out of here, how can I not be especially happy!

I remember the first time people in our village saw a tractor was in a movie. Everyone was amazed when they saw it pulling several wide and large plows, turning the land effortlessly, and they said, "How great it would be if our village had this thing!" In 1954, the state decided to build the First Tractor Factory next to our village, and everyone in the village was extremely happy. They scrambled to offer the land they had cultivated for generations to allow the tractor factory to be built here. Everyone said: As long as we can use tractors to plow the land in the future, the tractor factory can have whatever it wants.

In June 1958, after I was admitted to the tractor factory as an apprentice, I told the people in the village, "I have become a worker at the tractor factory! Wait for the tractors we make!" At this time, the people in the village encouraged me to study technology well. Who knew that learning to manufacture tractors would be hundreds of times harder than farming. But in order to produce tractors as soon as possible, I was determined to learn technology well, even if there were nine hundred and ninety-nine difficulties, I would make them bow their heads one by one. At the same time, Master Ma Yaozu, who taught me technology, was also very patient. If we didn’t understand it the first time, he would teach us two, three times… until we learned it. In this way, I was able to operate independently in just three months.

After the rural areas realized people's communes in the second half of 1958, the need for tractors became even more urgent. Every time I went home, the people in the village would always ask me, "When will you make tractors and send a few to our commune?" I would say, "Soon, soon, soon you will be able to replace your plows with machines!" At this time, the factory Party committee called on all factory workers to muster greater revolutionary zeal and produce more tractors to support agricultural mechanization. I was extremely excited and desperately tried to find ways to produce more tractors with everyone. Where should I start with technological innovation? After thinking about it, I always felt that the two oil filler pipes on the rear axle of the tractor I processed were not very necessary. They could be replaced with a crooked-mouth tin funnel, which could save two kilograms of steel, four working hours, and a set of tools and fixtures per tractor. Based on an annual output of 15,000 units, 30,000 kilograms of steel and 60,000 working hours could be saved in one year. After this suggestion was put forward, the factory leaders, Soviet experts, and master workers all supported it and approved the suggestion. Later, I continued to study and put forward a total of sixteen suggestions for technological innovation, which can improve production efficiency by an average of about 20%.

Now, our factory has fully entered mass assembly line production. All factory workers are implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, mustering greater enthusiasm, and carrying out high-quality and high-yield production competitions. In the competition, with the help of master workers, I have learned to operate independently on three types of machine tools. I can now completely adjust the eight types of tractor parts that I process myself, and all of them have broken the quotas. But I will never be complacent. I will definitely continue to work hard, guarantee the mass production of tractors, support agricultural mechanization, and make agriculture continue to leap forward.

    在少年放牛的地方
    第一拖拉机制造厂徒工　符光尧
    这座拖拉机厂的厂址，就是我少年割草放牛的地方，也是我祖祖辈辈的家乡。现在，从这里开出来“东方红”牌拖拉机，我怎能不特别高兴呢！
    记得我们村里人第一次看见拖拉机还是在电影里，大家看到它拖着几个又宽又大的犁铧，毫不费力气地把地翻过来，都惊讶地说：“要是咱村有了这家伙该多好啊！”1954年国家确定在我们村边建设第一拖拉机厂，全村的人都高兴极了，争着把自己世世代代耕种的土地献出来，让拖拉机厂在这里建设，大伙儿并且说：只要将来能用拖拉机耕地，拖拉机厂要啥给啥。
    1958年6月我考入拖拉机厂当徒工后，见村里的人就说：“我成了拖拉机厂的工人啦！等用我们制造的拖拉机吧！”这时，村里的人鼓励我好好学习技术。谁知道学制造拖拉机比种地要难几百倍。但是为了早日把拖拉机生产出来，我下定了学好技术的决心，就是有九百九十九个困难，也要叫它一个个地低头。同时，教我学习技术的马耀祖老师傅，也真耐心极了，一遍不会，两遍、三遍……，直到我们学会为止。这样，只三个月的时间我就能独立操作了。
    1958年后半年农村实现人民公社化以后，需要拖拉机更迫切了。我每次回家，村里的人总要问我：“你们啥时造出拖拉机，开几台来咱社呀？”我就说：“快啦，快啦，很快就要叫你们的犁头换上机器啦！”这时厂党委号召全厂职工鼓足更大的革命干劲，多多生产拖拉机，支援农业机械化。我兴奋极了，拼命地想办法和大伙一块多造拖拉机。我从哪儿下手搞技术革新呢？想来想去，总感到我加工的拖拉机后桥上的两个加油管，不十分必要，可以做一个歪嘴铁皮漏斗代替，一台拖拉机可以节约两公斤钢材，四个工时和一套工夹具。按年产一万五千台计算，一年可节约三万公斤钢材，六万个工时。这一建议提出后，厂里的领导、苏联专家和老师傅都很支持，并批准了这个建议。以后我又继续钻研，提出技术革新建议共十六条，平均约可提高生产效率20％。
    现在，我们厂全面投入大流水生产了。全厂职工正以党的八届八中全会的精神，鼓足更大的干劲，开展优质高产生产竞赛。竞赛中，我在老师傅的帮助下，已经学会了在三种机床上独立操作，我加工的八种拖拉机零件，自己完全能调整了，并且全部突破了定额。但是我决不自满，一定再接再厉，保证大量生产拖拉机，支援农业机械化，使农业继续跃进。　（任继武代笔）
