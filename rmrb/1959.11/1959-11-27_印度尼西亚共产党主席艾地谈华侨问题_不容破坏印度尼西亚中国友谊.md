Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 25th: The Indonesian newspaper "People's Daily" today published a statement made to the press by the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, Aidit.

When talking about his opinions on holding the Second Asian-African Conference, Aidit said that the suggestion to hold a Second Asian-African Conference is of course good. However, the most appropriate time must be chosen for holding such a conference. He said that if such a conference is held at a time when there are many contradictions between Asian and African countries, it will be impossible to achieve success.

Aidit said that in order for the Second Asian-African Conference to be successful, those Asian and African countries that have strained relations must first resolve their problems through peaceful and friendly bilateral talks.

When a reporter asked about his attitude toward the Overseas Chinese issue raised by some newspapers, Aidit said that if there were no people behind the Overseas Chinese issue attempting to undermine the friendship between Indonesia and China and disrupt the Indonesian economy, this issue would not have become as tense as it is now.

Aidit said that he hopes the Indonesian people will not act like those who are afraid to confront tigers and only beat cats. They should not target small Overseas Chinese merchants as targets of attack because they are afraid to confront large Western enterprises such as the Batavia Petroleum Company, Texaco Oil Company, and Mobil Oil Company. Aidit quoted President Sukarno as saying that the Indonesian people must have the "spirit of the tiger" or the "spirit of the bull." Aidit added that if these people truly had this spirit, they would not be afraid of Batavia Petroleum Company, Texaco Oil Company, and Mobil Oil Company, and at the same time, they would never oppose small Overseas Chinese merchants.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 26th: The Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party has decided to send a delegation headed by the Party's Chairman Aidit to attend the congresses of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Italian Communist Party. The delegation left Jakarta by plane today. Members of the delegation include Secretariat Secretary Peris Pardede.

    印度尼西亚共产党主席艾地谈华侨问题
    不容破坏印度尼西亚中国友谊
    新华社雅加达25日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天刊载了印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会主席艾地向报界发表的谈话。
    艾地在谈到他对举行第二次亚非会议的意见时说，举行第二次亚非会议的建议当然是好的。但是，举行这样一次会议要选择最适当的时机。他说，正当亚非国家之间现在发生许多矛盾的时候，如果举行这样的会议，是不可能取得成就的。
    艾地说，为了使第二次亚非会议成功，发生紧张关系的那些亚非国家，现在首先必须通过和平和友好的双边会谈的办法来解决它们之间的问题。
    当记者问到他对一些报纸提出的华侨问题所采取的态度时，艾地说，如果在华侨问题背后没有企图破坏印度尼西亚—中国的友谊和扰乱印度尼西亚经济的那些人，这个问题是不会变得像目前这样紧张的。
    艾地说，他希望印度尼西亚人民在行动中不要像这样的一种人：他们由于害怕对抗老虎而只去打猫。不应该由于害怕对抗西方大企业，如巴达维亚石油公司、德士古石油公司和美孚油公司，而把华侨小商人作为打击的对象。艾地援引苏加诺总统的话说，印度尼西亚人民必须有“老虎的精神”或“公牛的精神”。艾地又说，如果这些人真有这种精神，他们就不会害怕巴达维亚石油公司、德士古石油公司和美孚油公司、同时他们也决不会同华侨小商人作对。
    新华社雅加达26日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会决定派遣以党的主席艾地为首的代表团，出席匈牙利社会主义工人党和意大利共产党的代表大会。代表团今天乘飞机离开雅加达。代表团成员包括书记处书记佩利斯·帕尔德德。
