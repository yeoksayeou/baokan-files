Xinhua News Agency, November 27th: Recent facts demonstrate that, under the smokescreen of so-called easing international tensions, the United States is continuing to intensify its military provocations against our country. According to Taipei reports, the United States recently transported seven large landing craft to Taiwan for use by Chiang Kai-shek's navy. The U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan will hold a ceremony on November 30th in southern Taiwan to hand over these landing craft to Chiang's troops. Chiang Kai-shek's navy has announced that this is intended to "strengthen the supply capabilities" of Chiang's troops to our inland sea islands such as Kinmen and Matsu.

Prior to this, the United States had announced the provision of a batch of RF-101 Voodoo jet reconnaissance aircraft to Chiang Kai-shek's air force to "photograph the Chinese mainland." Recently, American generals have also been continuously running to Taiwan to conduct conspiratorial activities. For example, White, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army in the Pacific, O'Donnell, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Air Force in the Pacific, and Meen, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Navy, visited U.S. and Chiang military bases in Taiwan and held military talks in mid-November. It is worth noting that Bicheno, Deputy Director of Operations of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dean, Commander of the U.S. 13th Air Force Forward Command in Taiwan, and Li William, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command, flew from Taipei to Kinmen Island on November 8th and climbed to the top of Taiwu Mountain to spy on our mainland situation.

    美国在台湾地区加紧挑衅
    派将军到金门活动　拨武器给蒋军使用
    新华社27日讯　最近一系列的事实表明，美国在口口声声主张缓和国际局势的烟幕下，正继续加紧向我国进行军事挑衅。据台北消息，美国最近把七艘大型登陆艇运到台湾交给蒋介石海军使用。美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团将在本月30日在台湾南部举行移交这批登陆艇给蒋军的仪式。据蒋介石海军方面宣布，这是美国要使蒋军对金门、马祖等我国内海岛屿“加强补给力量”。
    在这以前，美国已宣布把一批RF—一○一伏都式喷气摄影侦察机给蒋介石空军“拍摄中国大陆的照片”。最近一个时期，美国将军们还接连不断地跑到台湾进行阴谋活动。如太平洋区美国陆军总司令怀特、太平洋区美国空军总司令欧当纳尔、美国海军部助理部长米恩等，曾在11月中旬到台湾视察美、蒋军事基地和举行军事会谈。值得注意的是，美国参谋长联席会议作战部副主管毕其诺、美国第十三航空队驻台湾前进指挥部司令狄恩、侵台美军司令部参谋长李威廉等，曾在11月8日由台北飞往金门岛，并且攀登太威山顶偷窥我大陆情况。
