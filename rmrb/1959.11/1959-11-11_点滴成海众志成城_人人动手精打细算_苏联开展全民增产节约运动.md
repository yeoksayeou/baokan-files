Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 9th: While launching a socialist competition to strive for early and over-fulfillment of the Seven-Year Plan, Soviet working people have also launched a national movement for increased production, thrift, and cost reduction this year. Now, this movement has yielded fruitful results and continues to develop.

In the first three quarters, the entire Soviet Union saved more than 7 billion rubles beyond the plan simply from reducing the cost of industrial products.

    Practice Thrift in Every Position

As early as the beginning of this year, the large-scale movement for increased production, thrift, and cost reduction swept across every production department in the Soviet Union like a spring breeze. Workers in many regions put forward slogans such as "March towards Thrift" and "Practice Thrift in Big and Small Matters, in Every Labor Position." Workers in various places came up with various methods to save raw materials, fuel, and electricity, maximize the use of surplus waste materials, improve product quality, reduce costs, and reduce defective products. This movement was carried out in conjunction with technological innovation, so it also promoted technological progress. The construction sector's workers proposed a plan to save 10 billion rubles for the country in one year. To this end, many construction sites launched a "Competition to Save 10 Billion Rubles." The workers of the Chelyabinsk Iron and Steel United Factory Construction Trust pledged to overfulfill the plan to reduce construction and installation costs by 1%, saving 30 million rubles in one year. In the first three quarters, they had already saved 25 million rubles. Workers at the Saporozh Construction Trust used industrialized construction methods to build housing, reducing construction and installation costs by 13%. Since the beginning of this year, one out of every eight houses they built was constructed using materials they saved themselves.

    Reduce Metal Waste to Zero

Saving metal, especially non-ferrous metals, is one of the most important aspects of saving various materials. In recent months, from primary school students collecting scrap iron to workers saving and utilizing metal, a large amount of metal has been saved for the country. Workers in many enterprises have put forward the slogan of "Reducing Metal Waste to Zero." Heavy industrial enterprises in Chelyabinsk, Leningrad, Gorky, Kharkov, and other places have created many experiences in this regard. The Gorky Automobile Factory has been particularly successful. The factory's workers organized dozens of comprehensive metal-saving work teams, whose members included workers, designers, technicians, and foremen, in order to jointly solve the problem of saving metal. As a result of their careful planning, they found that with slight technical improvements, they could save 138 kilograms of metal from manufacturing a "GAZ-51" truck and 52 kilograms of metal from a "Volga" car, while improving the quality and sturdiness of the vehicles. In the first three quarters of this year, the metal saved by this method was enough to manufacture about 2,000 trucks.

    Accumulate Funds for the Seven-Year Plan

In the national movement for increased production and thrift, Soviet workers also launched a movement to "Accumulate Funds for the Seven-Year Plan." The central content of this movement is to save funds for the country by proposing and adopting inventions and rationalization proposals. For example, the workers of the Moscow "Rubber" factory, who initiated this movement, pledged to save 75 million rubles in seven years using this method. This year alone, they will propose and adopt at least 3,000 rationalization proposals, which, after adoption, can save more than 10 million rubles for the country. Currently, the "Accumulate Funds for the Seven-Year Plan" movement has almost become widespread in various industrial enterprises. Factories that have launched this movement have not only saved a lot of funds, but have also rapidly promoted technological progress and increased labor productivity.

In order to make the movement for increased production and thrift most effective, workers in various parts of the Soviet Union have established various public inspection systems this year to tap the potential for increased production and thrift. Many factory workers inspected the disposal of surplus waste materials in production and put forward the slogan of "Eliminating Waste Materials," thereby eliminating many wasteful phenomena.

### 点滴成海众志成城　人人动手精打细算  苏联开展全民增产节约运动

    点滴成海众志成城　人人动手精打细算
    苏联开展全民增产节约运动
    新华社莫斯科9日电　苏联劳动人民在展开争取提前和超额完成七年计划的社会主义竞赛同时，今年还掀起了增产节约和降低成本的全民运动。现在，这一运动已经收到了丰硕的果实，并且还在继续发展。
    在头三个季度，全苏联单是从降低工业产品成本中就超计划节约了七十多亿卢布。
    每个岗位都厉行节约
    还在今年年初，声势浩大的增产节约、降低成本运动，就像春风一样吹遍了苏联每个生产部门，许多地区的职工都提出了“向节约进军”、“在大小事情中，在每个劳动岗位上，厉行节约”的口号。各地职工想出各种办法，来节约原材料、燃料和电力，最大限度地利用生产剩余的废材料，提高产品质量，降低成本和减少废品。这个运动是结合着技术革新来进行的，因此它也促进了技术进步。建筑部门的职工提出计划，要在一年中为国家节约一百亿卢布，为此，许多建筑工地展开了“节约一百亿卢布的竞赛”。切列波维茨钢铁联合工厂建筑托辣斯的职工保证要超额1％完成降低建筑安装成本的计划，在一年内节约三千万卢布。在头三个季度中，他们已经节约了二千五百万卢布。萨坡罗什建筑托辣斯的工人采用工业化建筑方法来建造住房，使建筑安装成本降低了13％，今年以来，他们建造的每八间房子中，就有一间是用自己节约下来的材料建筑的。
    把金属浪费减少到零
    节约金属、特别是有色金属，是节约各种材料中最重要的方面之一。最近几个月来，从小学生收集废铁到职工节约利用金属，都给国家节约了大量金属。许多企业的职工提出了“把金属浪费减少到零”的口号。车里雅宾斯克、列宁格勒、高尔基、哈尔科夫等地的重型工业企业，在这方面都创造了许多经验。其中成绩尤其突出的是高尔基汽车工厂。这个工厂的职工组织了几十个综合节约金属工作队，工作队的成员包括工人、设计人员、技术员、工长，以便共同解决节约金属问题。经他们精打细算的结果，只要稍稍改进技术，就可以从制造一辆“嘎斯——五一”型汽车上节约一百三十八公斤金属，从一辆“伏尔加”牌小汽车上可节约五十二公斤金属，而汽车的质量和坚固程度却提高了。在今年头三个季度中，这个工厂用这种办法节约的金属足够制造约二千辆载重汽车。
    为七年计划积累基金
    在全民性增产节约运动中，苏联职工还展开了“积累七年计划基金”的运动。这个运动的中心内容是，通过提出和采用创造发明和合理化建议的办法，来为国家节约资金。例如，发起这一运动的莫斯科“橡胶”工厂的职工保证要在七年内用这种方法节约七千五百万卢布。今年一年，他们要提出和采用至少三千件合理化建议，采用这些建议后可以为国家节约一千多万卢布。目前，“积累七年计划基金”运动几乎已经普及到各工业企业。凡是展开这一运动的工厂，不但节约了大量资金，同时还迅速促进了技术进步和劳动生产率的提高。
    为了使增产节约运动能最有成效地进行，苏联各地职工今年纷纷建立起各种公众检查制度，发掘增产节约潜力。许多工厂职工检查了生产中剩余废材的处理情况，提出了“消灭废材”的口号，从而消除了许多浪费现象。
