Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Guizhou Province has seen rapid development in poultry production. By mid-October, the province had a total of over 35.4 million chickens and ducks, an increase of 47% compared to before the establishment of the communes, averaging nearly eleven birds per household.

This year, Guizhou Province, while vigorously promoting hog production, launched a mass spring and autumn hatching campaign, with 96% of farm households hatching chickens and ducks. Many people's communes have also established collective incubation stations to improve hatching rates. In the Bijie and Tongren special districts alone, more than thirty incubation stations capable of hatching 10,000 to 20,000 eggs have been established. Due to the rapid development of poultry, commercial departments purchased more than 3 million poultry and 46.13 million fresh eggs in the first nine months of this year. The collective chicken farming operation in the Jincheng Management District of the Yangchuan Commune in Suiyang County has increased the commune's income by 11,800 yuan from January to early October this year.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: People's communes in Sichuan are vigorously developing poultry production. According to statistics from relevant departments by the end of September, the province had raised more than 84 million poultry of various types, with an average of more than six birds per household, an increase of nearly double compared to the end of last year.

In developing poultry production, various localities have developed collective poultry production on the one hand, and helped commune members' families solve various specific problems such as the lack of breeding stock, mobilizing them to actively raise poultry. The poultry farms generally established by communes in various localities have the dual task of cultivating breeding stock, promoting improved breeds of poultry, and hatching and laying eggs. In solving the problem of the lack of breeding stock for commune members, the following methods have been adopted in various localities: lending the breeding stock collectively raised by the commune to commune members free of charge for breeding eggs; supplying the commune's chicks and ducklings to commune members for raising at cost; and mobilizing the masses to adjust to each other.

In terms of solving the problem of poultry feed, Ying Shan County has promoted more than 30 kinds of substitute feeds based on the experience of the masses, mainly adopting the five methods of "reserving, planting, collecting, creating, and releasing." Reserving means that the commune retains a small amount of broken rice and bran as feed according to quotas; planting means using vacant land in front of and behind houses and on barren slopes to plant feed crops; collecting means collecting wild feeds such as grass and pests; creating means artificially cultivating and manufacturing insect feed; and releasing means driving poultry to vacant fields and barren slopes for grazing.

    贵州四川公社化后家禽发展快
    据新华社讯　贵州省家禽生产发展很快。到10月中旬，全省共饲养鸡、鸭三千五百四十多万只，比公社化前增长47％，平均每一农户近十一只。
    今年，贵州省在狠抓生猪生产的同时，掀起了群众性的春孵和秋孵运动，96％的农户都孵了鸡、鸭。许多人民公社还建立集体孵化站，提高孵化率。毕节、铜仁两专区就建立了能孵一万到两万个蛋的孵化站三十多个。由于家禽的迅速发展，今年头九个月商业部门就收购家禽三百多万只，鲜蛋四千六百一十三万个。绥阳县洋川公社金城管理区集体养鸡业，从今年元月到10月上旬止，已经为公社增加收入一万一千八百元。
    据新华社讯　四川各地人民公社大力发展家禽生产。据有关部门到9月底的统计，全省已饲养各种家禽八千四百多万只，每户农民平均六只以上，比去年年底增加了将近一倍。
    在发展家禽生产中，各地一方面发展集体家禽生产，一方面帮助社员家庭解决种禽缺乏等各种具体问题，发动他们积极饲养家禽。各地公社普遍建立的养禽场，一般都担负了培育种禽、推广家禽良种和家禽孵育、产蛋的双重任务。在解决社员种禽缺乏方面，各地采用了以下的办法：把公社集体饲养的种禽无偿地借给社员繁殖种蛋；把公社的小鸡小鸭按成本供应社员喂养；发动群众互相调剂。
    在解决家禽饲料方面，营山县根据群众经验推广的代用饲料就有三十多种，主要是采取“留、种、采、造、放”五种办法。留，即由公社按定额提留少部分碎米、糠麸作饲料；种，即利用屋前屋后荒坡空地种植饲料作物；采，即采集青草、害虫等野生饲料；造，即人工培育制造昆虫饲料；放，即把家禽赶到空田荒坡放牧。
