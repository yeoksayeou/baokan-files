Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: Amidst the frequent good news from industrial and agricultural production, the peak season market presents a prosperous scene: the progress of agricultural product procurement is rapid, the purchase volume of industrial products has increased greatly, sales are steadily rising, commodity inventories are ample, and urban and rural material exchanges are active.
　　Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held the conference on non-staple food and handicraft production in large and medium-sized cities in Shanghai in June, especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the economic fronts have been opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and launching a new high tide of increasing production and practicing economy, providing more and more sources of goods for the commercial sector. The vast number of commercial workers are full of energy and actively organize purchases. Since entering the third quarter, a new situation of booming purchasing and sales has generally appeared in the market. The materials purchased by the commercial system, whether agricultural products or industrial products, have been increasing month by month. Various agricultural products entered a high tide of purchase and storage shortly after their successive debuts. Now, an agricultural product procurement campaign centered on grain, cotton, and oil is surging in the vast countryside and has yielded fruitful results. From the time the new grain was put on the market until mid-October, more than 60% of the grain purchase task for the production year had been completed. In faster-progressing areas such as Guizhou Province, the purchase task had been overfulfilled by early October; Sichuan, Henan, Shaanxi and other provinces have completed more than 93% of the task. The purchase progress of cotton, edible vegetable oil, flue-cured tobacco, etc., across the country is faster than in the same period last year. The cotton purchased in mid-October increased by 21% compared with the first ten days of the month, and flue-cured tobacco increased by 80%. The acquisition of other agricultural and sideline products and local specialties has also achieved great results. This year's tea purchase task has been overfulfilled ahead of schedule, and the total value of local specialties purchased in the third quarter has increased by more than double compared with the same period last year. The successful completion of these agricultural product and local specialty purchase tasks is of great significance for ensuring the supply of grain and raw materials for light industry, and for meeting domestic market and export needs.
　　Under the new situation of continuous leap forward in industrial production, various industrial departments have provided sufficient sources of goods for the market. In September alone, the total value of industrial products purchased by the Ministry of Commerce increased by about 25.3% compared with August. The small commodities purchased in large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin in September are even more dazzling and have everything that one could wish for. As of the end of September, the total value of commercial sector commodity inventories not only increased compared with the same period last year, but also exceeded the inventory level at the end of 1958.
　　Judging from the market commodity supply situation, there is also a good scene. According to statistics from the Commercial Retail Headquarters, the national social commodity volume in September increased by 17% compared with August. Among the sixty major commodities, the supply volume from January to September this year has increased significantly compared with the same period last year, with clothing increasing by nearly 30% and food increasing by 4.8%. The growth of other daily necessities and cultural supplies is as follows: soaps, bicycles, clocks, machine-made paper, etc., increased by 10% to 30%; enamel products, radios, etc., increased by 30% to 50%; and gold pens, fountain pens, etc., increased by more than 50%. Not only is the quantity supplied large, but the variety of colors and varieties is also richer and more colorful than in the past. Since September, department stores in large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas have generally increased the number of commodities supplied by one or two thousand varieties compared with the past. The variety of commodities supplied by the Wangfujing Department Store in Beijing has reached more than 35,000, an increase of more than 4,000 compared with the same period last year. At present, winter commodities have all been put on the market, and both large and small stores are full of goods on shelves and cabinets, and the commodities are extremely complete. The further development of the movement to increase production and practice economy, and the further popularization of the style of diligence and frugality in managing households, have led to a continuous increase in urban and rural savings and a significant decline in the purchasing power of government agencies and organizations. According to cadres from the savings departments of the People's Bank of China, even in late September, on the eve of National Day, savings continued to grow in various places, which has never happened before. At the end of September, urban savings increased by 500 million yuan compared with the same period last year, and rural deposits increased by one-fold compared with the same period last year. In the third quarter, the purchasing power of government agencies and organizations was not only lower than the level in the first and second quarters of this year, but also decreased by 3.3% compared with the same period last year.
　　The Ministry of Commerce believes that the current prosperous market scene is completely in line with the excellent situation on the industrial and agricultural production fronts. From the analysis of the growth of urban and rural purchasing power in the fourth quarter, due to the large-scale listing of agricultural products and the diversified operations of the People's Communes, the growth rate of rural purchasing power will be greater than that of cities, and the situation of further market prosperity can be foreseen.

    市场景象和工农业形势相适应
    城乡购销两旺
    工农业产品收购量月月增加销售额上升
    新华社2日讯　在工农业生产捷报频传中，旺季市场呈现一片繁荣景象：农产品收购进度迅速，工业品收购数量大增，销售额稳步上升，商品库存充裕，城乡物资交流活跃。
    自从6月间中共中央在上海举行大中城市副食品和手工业生产会议以来，特别是党的八届八中会议以后，各条经济战线上反右倾、鼓干劲，掀起新的增产节约运动高潮，给商业部门提供的货源越来越多，广大商业职工干劲十足，积极组织收购，进入第三季度以来，市场普遍出现购销两旺的新局面。商业系统购进的物资无论是农产品或工业品，都是月月增多。各种农产品在相继登场不久，就纷纷进入了收购和入库高潮。现在一个以粮、棉、油为中心的农产品收购运动，正在广大农村汹涌澎湃地展开，并已收到丰硕果实。从新粮上市到10月中旬为止，粮食已完成生产年度征购任务的60％以上，进度较快的地区如贵州省，在10月上旬就已超额完成了征购任务；四川、河南、陕西等省都已完成任务的93％以上。全国棉花、食用植物油料、烤烟等的收购进度都比去年同期为快，10月中旬收购的棉花比上旬增加21％，烤烟增加80％。其他农副产品和土特产品的收购成绩也很大，今年的茶叶收购任务已提前超额完成，第三季度收购的土特产品总值比去年同期增长了一倍以上。这些农产品和土特产品收购任务的胜利完成，对于保证粮食和轻工业原料的供应，对于满足国内市场和出口需要有极重大的意义。
    在工业生产不断跃进的新形势下，各工业部门为市场提供了充沛的货源。仅9月份，商业部购进的工业品总值就比8月份增长了25.3％左右。北京、上海、天津等大城市9月份收购的小商品，更是琳琅满目，应有尽有。截至9月底，商业部门商品库存总额不但比去年同期增加，并且超过了1958年底的库存水平。
    从市场商品供应的情况看，也是一片好景象。据商业零售总部统计，9月份全国社会商品额比8月份增长17％。在六十种主要商品中，今年1至9月的供应量比去年同期都有较大的增长，其中衣着类增长近30％，食品类增长4.8％。其他日用品和文化用品增长的情况是：增长10％到30％的有肥皂、自行车、钟、机制纸等；增长30％到50％的有搪瓷制品、收音机等；增长50％以上的有金笔、钢笔等。不但供应的数量多，花色品种也比过去丰富多采。9月份以来，大中城市和工矿区百货公司供应的商品，一般都比过去增加一二千种，北京王府井百货大楼供应的商品品种已达到三万五千多种，比去年同期增加了四千多种。目前冬令商品已经全部应市，大小商店都是货满架、物满柜，商品极为齐全。增产节约运动的进一步开展，勤俭治家风气的进一步普及，使城乡储蓄额不断上升，机关集团购买力显著下降。据人民银行储蓄部门的干部谈，即使在9月末国庆节前夕，各地储蓄额还是继续增长，这是过去从来没有的。9月末城镇储蓄额比去年同期增加了五亿元，农村存款比去年同期增长达一倍。第三季度机关集团购买力不但低于今年一、二季度的水平，而且比去年同期减少3.3％。
    商业部认为，当前市场的繁荣景象是和工农业生产战线上的大好形势完全相适应的。从第四季度城乡购买力增长的情况分析，由于农产品大量上市，人民公社大搞多种经营，农村购买力增长速度将比城市大，市场进一步繁荣的局势已可预见。
