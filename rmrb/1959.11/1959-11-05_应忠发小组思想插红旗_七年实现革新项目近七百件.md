Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch: The Ying Zhongfa Group of the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory, which has maintained the honor of advanced collective for nine years, has completed its annual production task, increased by 125.7% compared with last year, in just nine months this year, and has begun to stride into 1960.

The Ying Zhongfa Group was formerly led by the nationally renowned model worker Lu Agou. Since this group first won the title of advanced group in 1950, it has been advancing continuously under the red flag for nine years. Over the past nine years, all the group's one hundred-plus members have united closely, becoming stronger and stronger. From the start of the group's plan in 1953 to September of this year, for eighty-one consecutive months, they completed the state plan every month, and in seventy-eight of those months, they comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan. This year, their labor productivity has further improved, achieving the output of two people from last year.

Persisting in putting politics in command and continuously planting the red flag of ideology is the fundamental reason why this group has become advanced and can maintain its advanced status. In recent years, all those who have been transferred to this group have become more active if they were originally active; those who were originally average or relatively backward have also made progress with the help of the group, and some have even become backbones. Therefore, people call the Ying Zhongfa Group a communist "furnace." For example, when a young worker first came to the group, he was undisciplined in his actions, and fearing responsibility for defective products, he secretly stuffed them into the furnace to melt them. After the group discovered this, it sternly criticized him and sent a teacher to help him specifically. With the help of the group, this young man made rapid progress, and soon joined the Communist Youth League and the Party, becoming a backbone of the group. In this way, the Ying Zhongfa Group has cultivated a large number of new workers and backbones for the country, supporting newly built factories in other places and other fraternal factories. Among them, eleven people have been promoted to cadres from their group, and twenty-eight skilled workers have been transferred out.

The Ying Zhongfa Group also often combines political work with production work. When the group receives major production tasks, it first widely discusses the significance of these tasks for national construction. Therefore, no matter how heavy the task or how urgent the time, the group members can be full of energy and do everything possible to complete it. For example, before the Spring Festival this year, the No. 1 State Cotton Factory asked their factory to help rush-produce a part called "sleeve" within a week to convert the old-fashioned spinning machines into the world's most advanced super-high drafting spinning machines. At that time, there was only one week left before the Spring Festival, and the group's production task was very tight. After the Ying Zhongfa Group learned about this, they believed that this was a major innovation supporting the No. 1 State Cotton Factory and was of great significance, so they resolutely requested to accept it. In the process of manufacturing this new part, they encountered many difficulties, but they used their brains and boldly reformed the product design. After three days and nights of hard work, they finally completed the task ahead of schedule.

The production tasks of the Ying Zhongfa Group increase year by year and improve month by month, and there are often "shock" tasks, but their machines are very old, and most of them are "old-fashioned punch presses" driven by belts. The way they solve this contradiction is to "constantly make revolution, and everyone makes innovation." During the first Five-Year Plan period, the Ying Zhongfa Group had two hundred and thirty-two documented innovation projects, one hundred and three were achieved in 1958, and from January to September this year, four hundred and thirty were proposed, three hundred and sixty have been achieved, and they have also successfully trial-produced the cutting-edge product on textile machinery - the "spring clip" part, realizing the ideal of all parts for spinning machines being manufactured domestically.

### 应忠发小组思想插红旗  七年实现革新项目近七百件

    应忠发小组思想插红旗
    七年实现革新项目近七百件
    据新华社上海电　九年来一直保持先进集体荣誉的国营上海第二纺织机械厂应忠发小组，今年又以九个月的时间提前完成了比去年增加125.7％的全年生产任务，开始跨进了1960年。
    应忠发小组以前是由全国著名的劳动模范陆阿狗领导的。这个小组自从1950年第一次获得先进小组的称号后，九年来一直高举红旗不断前进。九年来，全组一百多人紧密团结，愈战愈强，从1953年开始有小组计划到今年9月份，连续八十一个月，月月完成国家计划，其中有七十八个月全面超额完成国家计划。今年，他们的劳动生产率进一步提高，做到了一个抵上去年两个人。
    坚持政治挂帅，不断地插思想红旗，是这个小组获得先进、并能保持先进的根本原因。几年来，凡是调到这个小组来的人，原来积极的更积极了；原来表现一般的或比较落后的，经过小组的帮助，也都进步起来，有的还成了骨干。因此，人们称应忠发小组为共产主义的“熔炉”。例如有一个青年工人初到小组时，行动散漫，出了废品怕追究责任，偷偷地把废品塞到炉子里熔掉。小组发现后，一面严肃地批评他，一面派老师具体帮助他。在小组帮助下，这个青年进步很快，不久以后就入了团、入了党，成了小组的骨干。应忠发小组就是这样，为国家培养了大批新工人和骨干，支援外地新建工厂和其他兄弟厂。其中，从他们小组中提拔为干部的有十一人，输送出去的技术工人有二十八人。
    应忠发小组还经常把政治工作和生产工作结合起来。当小组接到重大的生产任务时，首先广泛讨论这些任务对国家建设的意义。因此不论任务多么重，时间多么紧迫，小组组员们都能干劲十足，千方百计地完成。例如今年春节前，国棉一厂要求他们厂在一星期内帮助冲制一种叫做“套管”的零件，用来把旧式细纱机改为世界最新的超大牵伸精纺机。当时离春节只有一星期，小组生产任务非常紧，应忠发小组知道后，认为这是支援国棉一厂的创举，意义很大，坚决要求接受下来。在制造这种新零件中遇到不少困难，但他们开动脑筋，大胆改革产品设计，经过苦战三昼夜，终于提前完成了任务。
    应忠发小组的生产任务年年增加，月月提高，不时还有“突击”活，而他们的机器却很陈旧，大部分是用皮带拖的“老爷冲床”。他们解决这个矛盾的办法就是“不断闹革命，人人闹革新”。应忠发小组在第一个五年计划期间，有案可查的革新项目为二百三十二项，1958年实现了一百零三项，今年1月到9月提出四百三十项，已实现三百六十项，并且还试制成功纺织机械上的尖端产品——“弹格”零件，实现了细纱机零件全部由本国制造的理想。
