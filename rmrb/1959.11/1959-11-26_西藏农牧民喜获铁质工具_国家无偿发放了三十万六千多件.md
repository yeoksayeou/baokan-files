Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 25th: Tibetan farmers and herdsmen have received 306,957 pieces of iron agricultural and pastoral production tools distributed free of charge by the state, averaging 1.5 pieces per household. The vast majority of these free iron production tools were distributed this year and include new-style walking plows, harrow teeth, hoes, sickles, wool shears, and axes, etc., which are now in widespread use. Many farmers are happily taking their new harrow teeth, hoes, and new-style walking plows to the fields for winter plowing, striving for another bumper harvest next year.

The state's timely distribution of this batch of iron agricultural and pastoral production tools according to the urgent needs of Tibetan farmers and herdsmen has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of Tibetans. After the armed rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique was quelled this spring, the state, in order to help Tibetan farmers and herdsmen restore and develop production, began to distribute iron production tools free of charge while issuing interest-free grain and seed loans. When farmers in many villages received walking plows, they automatically learned how to operate them and actively promoted their use. In some places, temporary short-term training classes were also held at the request of the farmers.

According to a reporter from the Agricultural and Pastoral Department of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, this batch of iron production tools distributed free of charge by the state was ordered and transported from the interior of the motherland according to the specific conditions, circumstances, and habits of Tibet, and its farmers and herdsmen. In addition to more than 40,000 pieces distributed in the Qamdo area before 1954, the other more than 200,000 pieces were manufactured with funds allocated at the 7th meeting of the State Council on March 9, 1955. Factories in the interior of the motherland rushed to produce this batch of production tools day and night in order to support Tibetan farmers and herdsmen. However, due to the secret obstruction and sabotage by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, this batch of iron production tools, worth a total of 1.55 million yuan, had been stockpiled in warehouses for the past four years and could not be distributed to the farmers and herdsmen. Some of the tools that were distributed were also seized by the serf owners and their agents. It was not until after the rebellion was quelled this spring that they returned to the hands of the farmers and herdsmen and began to be used in production.

### 西藏农牧民喜获铁质工具  国家无偿发放了三十万六千多件

    西藏农牧民喜获铁质工具
    国家无偿发放了三十万六千多件
    新华社拉萨25日电　西藏农牧民已经获得了国家无偿发放给的三十万六千九百五十七件铁质农牧业生产工具，平均每户可得到一点五件。这批无偿铁质生产工具，绝大部分是今年发放的，包括新式步犁、耙齿、锄、镰刀、羊毛剪和斧头等，现在已经被广泛使用。许多农民兴高彩烈地带着新的耙齿、锄和新式步犁，在田野里进行冬耕，争取明年继续丰收。
    国家根据西藏农牧民的迫切需要，及时发放这批铁质农牧生产工具，受到了广大藏民的热烈欢迎。当今年春天原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团发动的武装叛乱平息后，国家为了帮助西藏农牧民恢复和发展生产，在发放无息贷粮贷种的时候，也同时开始无偿地发给铁质生产工具。许多乡村的农民在得到步犁时，都自动学习操作和积极推广，有些地方还在农民的要求下举办了临时的短期训练班。
    据记者从西藏自治区筹备委员会农牧处获悉，国家无偿发放的这批铁质生产工具，都是按照西藏的具体情况、条件和农牧民的习惯，从祖国内地订制运来的。除四万多件是1954年以前在昌都地区发放的以外，其他二十多万件，是1955年3月9日国务院第七次会议上决定拨款制造的，祖国内地各工厂为了支援西藏农牧民，曾经日夜赶制这批生产工具。可是由于原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的暗中阻挠和破坏，这批总值达一百五十五万元的铁质生产工具，在过去四年中一直积压在仓库中，未能发放到农牧民手里，已经发下去的一部分也被农奴主及其代理人所扣压，直到今年春天叛乱平息后才回到农牧民手中，开始用于生产。
