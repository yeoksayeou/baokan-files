    Promote the Spirit of Daring to Think and Act, Improve Equipment and Operating Methods
    Tianjin's Street Industry Achieves High Quality and Output
    (Our newspaper, Tianjin, November 17th) Tianjin's street industries, which developed during the Great Leap Forward of 1958, have achieved an all-round leap in production through mass movements against rightism, promoting enthusiasm, and practicing rigorous production increases and savings by vigorously carrying out technical innovations. Since August, the total output value has risen sharply. The total output value and processing income in October reached more than 24 million yuan, which is about twice that of July. At the same time, product quality has been continuously improved, and new varieties have been continuously increased. According to a survey of five streets in Heping District, the qualification rate of nineteen products in October increased from 95% in August to 99%. At present, the number of small commodities produced by street industries in the city has increased from 315 in July to more than 500.
    In the movement against rightism, promoting enthusiasm, increasing production and practicing economy, the broad masses of street cadres and members of production service cooperatives, under the leadership of the Party organizations of various districts and streets, vigorously launched a competition movement centered on technical innovation. In the technical innovation movement, the broad masses of street production personnel promoted the communist style of daring to think and act, broke the superstitious idea that women have low technical skills and cannot engage in technical innovation, and put forward a large number of rationalization proposals. Taking Xing'an Road Street as an example, the members of six production units put forward more than 1,000 technical innovation proposals in October, and more than 500 of them were realized in the same month, which greatly improved labor productivity and doubled production. In the past, the sewing factory of Julong Branch used templates to draw gloves one by one, and could only draw two per minute. Now, after using powder leak boards, it can leak fifty per minute. In the past, the positive product rate of the hardware workshop of Shuguang Branch in sand casting copper molds was only 70% to 80%; the members came up with ways to improve the tools and install cores on the molds, so that the eyes were formed when the castings came out, and the positive product rate reached 100%. Due to vigorous technical innovation, the members of the Caiyuli Production Service Cooperative in Xushui Chi Street, Nankai District, trial-produced a native method of coiling spring machine to replace manual operation, which increased from 80 jin of spring coiled per person per day to 2,250 jin per person per day, an efficiency increase of 27 times. After the implementation of many other technical innovation proposals, raw materials were greatly saved and production costs were reduced. The welding rod workshop of Mingyuan Xili Production Service Cooperative in Xushui Chi Street improved the formula and used substitutes to replace the precious raw material "rutile." In October alone, it saved 16,700 yuan, and the product quality was also fully qualified.
    In the technical innovation movement, the Party organizations of various streets further strengthened their leadership, and some street leading cadres personally went deep into various production units to lead production. The streets in Heping District implemented a system of leading cadres following the shifts for labor, leaders gained an in-depth understanding of the problems, solved the problems in a timely manner, and integrated with the masses, which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses for labor. When a member of the Gansu Road Street Party Committee followed a shift for labor, he found that the key to the low production efficiency of the mimeographing workshop was the improper arrangement of work procedures. He immediately helped the workshop adjust the work procedures and shifts, which increased the output of paper cutting in the entire workshop from 900,000 pages per day to 1.7 million pages.

    发扬敢想敢干的精神  改进设备和操作方法
    天津街道工业产量高质量好
    本报天津17日电　天津市1958年大跃进中发展起来的街道工业，在反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的群众运动中，大搞技术革新，生产获得全面跃进。8月份以来，生产总值直线上升，10月份的总产值和加工收益共达二千四百多万元，等于7月份的两倍左右。同时，产品质量日益提高，新品种不断增加。据和平区五个街的调查，10月份有十九种产品的合格率由8月份的95％上升到99％。目前全市街道工业生产的小商品，已由7月份的三百一十五种增加到五百多种。
    在反右倾鼓干劲增产节约的运动中，广大街道干部和生产服务社的社员们，在各区、街党组织的领导下，轰轰烈烈地掀起了以技术革新为中心的竞赛运动。在技术革新运动中，广大街道生产人员发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，破除了妇女技术低，不能搞技术革新的迷信思想，提出了大量的合理化建议。以兴安路街为例，六个生产单位的社员在10月份就提出了一千多件技术革新建议，当月就实现了五百余件，大大提高了劳动生产率，使生产成倍地增长。巨龙分社缝纫厂过去裁手套用样板一个个地画，一分钟只能画两个，现在改用粉子漏板以后，一分钟就可以漏五十个。曙光分社五金车间过去翻砂倒铜模正品率仅达70％到80％；社员们想办法改进了工具，在模子上装芯子，活一倒出来就有眼，正品率达到了百分之百。南开区蓄水池街采余里生产服务社的社员由于大搞技术革新，试制成土法缠簧机代替人工操作，由每人每天缠八十斤簧提高到每人每天缠二千二百五十斤，效率提高了二十七倍。还有许多技术革新建议实现以后，大大节约了原料材料，降低了生产成本。蓄水池街明远西里生产服务社电焊条车间由于改进了配方，采用代用品代替贵重原料“金红石”，10月份一个月就节约了一万六千七百元，产品质量也完全合格。
    在技术革新运动中，各街道的党组织都进一步加强了领导，有些街道领导干部亲自深入各生产单位领导生产。和平区各街都实行了领导跟班劳动的制度，领导深入了解问题，及时解决问题，和群众打成一片，大大地激发了群众的劳动热情。甘肃路街党委委员在跟班劳动的时候，发现誊印装车间生产效率不高的关键是工序安排不当，马上帮助这个车间调整了工序和班次，使全车间切纸的产量由日产九十万页提高到一百七十万页。
