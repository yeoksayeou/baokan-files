    The Dragon King Who Controls Water is a Commune Member
  For thousands of years, the Dragon King has controlled the water,
  But floods and droughts have repeatedly caused disasters.
  This year, we've built dikes and dams,
  The Dragon King who controls water is a commune member.
      --Hunan Folk Song--

    治水龙王是社员
  龙王管水几千年，
  水旱天灾闹连连，
  今年修好堤和坝，
  治水龙王是社员。
      ——湖南民歌——
