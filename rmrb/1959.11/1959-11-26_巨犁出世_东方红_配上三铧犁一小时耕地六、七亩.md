    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 25th: The three-bottom plow for deep plowing, designed to be used with the "Dongfanghong" brand tractor, has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Shangqiu Machinery Factory, a state-owned local enterprise in Henan Province, and is being prepared for mass production.
    This deep-plowing three-bottom plow is also a product of socialist large-scale cooperation. It was designed by the Jinan Farm Implement Factory and the Heilongjiang Universal Machinery Factory, based on the actual requirements of deep plowing in our country's agriculture and with reference to the advantages of foreign plow types.
    After the successful trial production of this deep-plowing three-bottom plow, representatives from relevant units such as the Ministry of Agricultural Machinery, the Henan Provincial Bureau of Mechanical Industry, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Kaifeng Prefecture Heavy Industry Bureau, as well as the Jinan Farm Implement Factory and the Heilongjiang Universal Machinery Factory, went to the site to participate in the appraisal. The appraisal concluded that the plow has a solid structure, good tillage performance, and is suitable for use in flat areas. It can plow to a depth of about 40 centimeters, and the soil is turned evenly, with no unplowed soil left after plowing. The furrow walls are neat and the furrow bottom is flat. When this plow is used with the "Dongfanghong" tractor, it can plow six to seven mu of land per hour.

    巨犁出世
    “东方红”配上三铧犁一小时耕地六、七亩
    据新华社郑州25日电  跟“东方红”牌拖拉机配套深耕的三铧犁，最近在河南省地方国营商丘机械厂试制成功，正在准备成批生产。
    这种深耕三铧犁也是社会主义大协作的产物。它是由济南农具厂和黑龙江通用机械厂，根据我国农业深耕要求的实际情况，参照外国犁型的优点而设计的。
    这种深耕三铧犁试制成功以后，农业机械部、河南省机械工业局、省农林厅、省农业科学院、开封专区重工业局，以及济南农具厂、黑龙江通用机械厂等有关单位，都派代表到现场参加了鉴定。鉴定认为：这种犁的结构牢固，耕作性能良好，适宜在平坦地带使用。它能深耕四十厘米左右，而且翻土均匀，犁后没有夹生现象，沟壁整洁，沟底平坦。这种犁同“东方红”拖拉机配套，每小时能耕六、七亩地。
