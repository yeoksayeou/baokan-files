	The heroic deeds of the heroes attending the National Congress of Advanced Groups and Workers are numerous. Here, I want to discuss the tenacious spirit these heroes have demonstrated in socialist construction.

	Zhang Jun, a technical innovation pacesetter from the Guizhou Automobile Parts Factory, is a carpenter with limited literacy. He encountered countless difficulties when creating a large-scale sawing machine, failing fourteen times. However, Zhang Jun never lost heart. Encouraged by the Party and with the help of his comrades, he finally built the large-scale sawing machine.

	The steering gear housing group of the First Automobile Factory launched a struggle to improve equipment and technology and increase production efficiency in order to improve automobile production capacity. In this struggle, they had to overcome six obstacles. An engineer suggested adding two high-efficiency machine tools. The workers, however, believed this would increase state investment, and ordering from other factories would delay production by a year. Therefore, they disagreed and advocated finding ways to improve existing equipment, merge processes, and increase speed. The engineer dismissed their ideas and left. The workers in this group then used their own brains, guaranteeing to work hard for several days and nights to overcome the six obstacles. After several days and nights of hard work, five obstacles were overcome, but in the last obstacle—testing the all-rigid boring machine—they failed more than twenty times before finally succeeding and exceeding the leap forward plan. At this time, the engineer couldn't help but say to the workers: "You guys are really something!" Think about it: how could a carpenter with limited literacy who had never studied machine manufacturing or mathematics calculate the speed of a machine? How did an ordinary worker overcome numerous difficulties to imitate an American-made planing machine that even an engineer dared not imitate, and even surpass the American product? How was a 10,000-ton ocean-going freighter, which our country had never built before, built in just fifty-eight days? And when hearing cold remarks like "Try it! If you succeed, you can get a prize," when experiments failed several, dozens, or even dozens of times, and when the "wait-and-see" types gloated and ridiculed, how much confidence and perseverance would it take to "not be discouraged by failure"! However, all difficulties and all cold remarks cannot shake the strong will of our heroic working class to build socialism. Qin Fengzhang, the leader of the Party cell of the steering gear housing group of the First Automobile Factory, said: "We will never lose heart even if we fail a thousand times!" What a heroic language, what a heroic spirit. From this, we see the ambition and great vitality of our working class and our nation.

	Lu Xun predicted thirty-four years ago that those "competitors who, although lagging behind, will not stop running until they reach the finish line" are "the future backbone of China." Our working class is the backbone of our country. In the peaceful competition with capitalist countries, although we are still relatively backward, we have the perseverance to keep running until we reach the finish line, and we will eventually become the winner. All "wait-and-see" types are precisely the kind of people Lu Xun satirized who sneer at those who run their best; they will also eventually say "You guys are really something!" in the face of the facts.

    参加群英会的英雄们的英雄事迹是很多的，这里我想谈谈这些英雄们在社会主义建设中所表现出来的坚韧不拔的精神。
    技术革新标兵、贵州汽车配件厂的张俊，是个粗识文字的木工，他在创造大型锯木机时，遇到了无数困难，曾经失败了十四次。但张俊从未灰心，在党的鼓舞下，同志们的帮助下，终于把大型锯木机制成了。
    第一汽车厂转向器壳小组，为了提高汽车生产能力，展开了改进设备、工艺，提高生产效率的斗争。在这场斗争中，必须突破六关。一位工程师主张增加两台高效率的机床，工人们则认为这样会增加国家投资，而且去外厂订货，要推迟一年才能投入生产。因此他们不赞成，主张从改进现有设备，合并工序，提高车速等方面想办法。工程师不以为然地离开了。这个小组的工人们就自己开动脑筋，保证苦战几天几夜过六关。经过几昼夜的苦战，五个关都过了，但在最后一关——试验全刚镗床时，失败了二十多次，才成功地达到了，并且超过了跃进计划。这时，那位工程师也禁不住向工人们说：“你们就是行啊！”想一想吧：一个没有学过机器制造学和数学的粗识文字的木工，是怎样才能计算出机器的转速的；一个工程师也不敢仿制的美国出品的刨木机，一个普通的工人，是怎样克服了重重难关，仿制成了，而且超过了美国货的；一艘我国从未造过的万吨远洋货轮，是怎样只用了五十八天的时间就建造成的；而当听到“试吧！试成了可以得奖”之类的冷言冷语时，当试验几次、十几次甚至几十次遭到失败、观潮派幸灾乐祸地耻笑时，该有多大的信心和毅力，才能作到“败而不馁”！然而，一切困难，一切冷言蜚语，都动摇不了我们英雄的工人阶级建设社会主义的坚强意志。第一汽车厂转向器壳小组的党小组长秦凤章说：“试验一千次不成功也决不灰心！”这是多么豪壮的语言，多么英雄的气概，从这里，我们看到了我们工人阶级、我们民族的志气和它的伟大的生命力。
    鲁迅在三十四年前曾预言那些“虽然落后而仍非跑至终点不止的竞技者”是“中国将来的脊梁”。我国的工人阶级，就是我们国家的脊梁。在和资本主义国家的和平竞赛中，我们现在虽还较落后，但我们有着非跑至终点不止的毅力，终将成为优胜者。一切观潮派，正是鲁迅所讽刺的那种嗤笑尽跑者的人；他们也终将在事实面前说一句“你们就是行啊！”
