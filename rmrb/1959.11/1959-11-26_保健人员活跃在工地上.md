Healthcare Workers Active on Construction Sites

In Qian County, Shaanxi Province, over ninety medical personnel and nine hundred healthcare workers are providing services at water conservancy construction sites. After arriving at the sites, they have extensively carried out healthcare work, greatly improving the sanitary conditions.

Medical personnel assist the construction site in training cooks, enabling them to understand general hygiene knowledge. Kitchens have added dust-proof equipment, drinking water is disinfected, and attention is paid to the nutritional value of meals. They also help the workers improve dormitory hygiene, thicken bedding, regularly air out quilts, install windproof grass curtains on doors and windows, and establish public toilets based on the workers' living conditions. Simultaneously, they educate the workers on paying attention to personal hygiene, regularly changing clothes, avoiding overeating or drinking, and preventing frostbite.

With the help of medical personnel, all water conservancy construction sites in the county are exhibiting a new atmosphere where everyone emphasizes hygiene, and both indoor and outdoor areas are tidy and clean. Over one hundred advanced canteens and sanitation model units have emerged at various sites. Workers are healthy, in high spirits, and attendance rates average over 98%, ensuring the smooth progress of water conservancy projects. (Photo attached)

    保健人员活跃在工地上
    陕西省乾县有九十多名医务人员和九百多名保健员到水利工地服务，他们来到工地以后，广泛地开展了保健工作，使工地卫生面貌大大改观。
    医务人员帮助工地训练炊事员，使他们懂得一般卫生常识，伙房增加了防尘设备，饮水注意消毒，饭食注意营养；帮助民工搞好宿舍卫生，加厚垫草，经常晒被褥，门窗都挂起了防风草帘，并根据民工的居住情况建立了公共厕所。同时教育民工注意个人卫生，经常换衣服，不暴饮不暴食，以及注意防治冻伤等常识。
    全县各水利工地在医务人员的帮助下，出现了人人讲卫生、室内室外整齐干净的新气象，各工地涌现出一百多个先进食堂和卫生模范单位，民工们身体健康，精神振奋，出勤率平均达到98％以上，保证了水利工程顺利进行。（附图片）
