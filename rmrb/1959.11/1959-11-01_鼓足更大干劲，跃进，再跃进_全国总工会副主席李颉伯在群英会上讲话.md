Xinhua News Agency, October 31st: Li Jiebo, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a speech today at the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Industry, Transportation, Basic Construction, Finance, and Trade, titled "Exert Greater Effort, Leap Forward, Further Leap Forward." He first pointed out: Now, the Party Central Committee has issued a great battle call to us, requiring us to catch up with and surpass England in the output of major industrial products in about ten years. It particularly emphasizes that we should achieve the technical transformation of agriculture as soon as possible within the same period, so that agriculture can realize mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification, and combine the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture. This is an extremely glorious and great task entrusted to the working class of the whole country by the Party, and we must fully accomplish this task.

Revolutionary drive is a priceless treasure for socialist construction. As long as we give full play to our soaring revolutionary drive, we can constantly create production miracles.

Our broad masses of workers have increasingly deeply realized that as long as we, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, adhere to putting politics in command, hold high the red flag of the Party's General Line, and launch mass movements on all fronts, we will definitely achieve a Great Leap Forward, and we will definitely be able to victoriously realize the historical tasks put forward by the Party. As trade union organizations that connect the Party with the masses, we should, under the leadership of the Party, hold high the red flag of the Party's General Line, vigorously launch mass movements, transform the realization of the historical tasks put forward by the Party into the conscious action of the broad masses, and make more and more workers become pioneers in implementing the Party's General Line.

Li Jiebo said: The essence of the Party's General Line is to maximize the role of people, to require us to give full play to our soaring revolutionary drive, to require our broad workers and the people of the whole country to contribute all their strength and wisdom with unparalleled labor enthusiasm on all fronts of production and construction, and to engage in socialist construction at an extraordinary speed. The great practice since the Great Leap Forward tells us that revolutionary drive is precisely the priceless treasure of socialist construction and the decisive factor in realizing a great leap in production. As long as we exert our revolutionary drive, we can use all favorable conditions to actively overcome difficulties, so that the technical revolution and technical innovation can radiate brilliant light, so that production records can be refreshed daily, and production miracles can be continuously created. The fact that the Benxi Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Ironmaking Plant increased the utilization coefficient of two "old and toothless blast furnaces" from 1.315 in 1957 to 2.007 and 2.577 during the Great Leap Forward, and created the miracle of breaking through the 3.0 mark, is a good proof.

Comrades, when we say that revolutionary drive is the decisive factor in production leaps, does this mean that we can disregard objective material and technical conditions and go beyond objective possibilities to do things that are really impossible? No, it is not. The Party has always advocated that revolutionary enthusiasm should be combined with scientific analysis, and that we should always pay attention to the possibilities of objective conditions. However, how can we truly understand objective conditions and utilize objective conditions? We Marxists and Leninists believe that only by first exerting our revolutionary drive can we conduct in-depth and comprehensive exploration of objective things, can we generate genuine scientific analysis, can we fully understand and master objective conditions, and can we try every means to utilize objective conditions, turning unfavorable conditions into favorable ones and turning difficulties into smooth progress. These principles have been proven by countless facts since the Great Leap Forward. "When the word 'difficult' comes first, it is difficult to move an inch; when the word 'do' comes first, one travels a thousand miles a day." If there is insufficient drive, even with very favorable conditions, one will feel that there are many difficulties. Once one exerts drive, one can recognize objective conditions, eliminate numerous difficulties, and open up a situation of leap forward.

To maintain a soaring revolutionary drive, it is necessary to continuously improve communist awareness and promote the working class's indomitable revolutionary determination.

Li Jiebo said: To maintain our soaring drive, an important experience is to continuously improve our communist awareness, establish lofty ambitions in the great cause of socialism and communism, and greatly promote the working class's indomitable revolutionary determination. Our working class is the creator of great history and the pillar of socialist construction. Since we have been able to stand up and become masters of the country and society under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao by relying on our own strength, we will definitely be able to build a great socialist country with our own hands and wisdom under the leadership of the Party. We should fully demonstrate that we are the great working class of a great country, march forward bravely for socialism and communism, and be wholeheartedly loyal to the Party and the people. With the pace of one day equaling twenty years, with the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and with the spirit of "making rivers give way and mountains bow their heads," we must continuously revolutionize and continuously move forward. Are we afraid of being tense? No. We must compete with capitalist countries for time and speed. We must build our country in the shortest possible time into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Naturally, we have to be a little tense. Isn't it not tense if we don't exert our drive? No, comrades, if we don't exert our drive, it means we don't want the General Line, it means we want to live in "poverty and blankness" forever, and we will always be threatened by imperialism, which is the real tension. In order to get rid of this tension, we must exert our drive and work hard today to create happiness for future generations. There will always be such or such difficulties on our road forward. Only by overcoming difficulties can we achieve victory. Our working class must try every means to actively overcome difficulties and move forward by riding the wind and waves, never bowing to difficulties, and developing skills from overcoming difficulties. It is precisely because we have such great determination and confidence in the cause of socialism and communism that thousands of advanced producers have shown a noble spirit of self-sacrifice, established a communist attitude of labor that does not care about remuneration, and promoted the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly. Comrades! This is precisely the communist style that the working class should have. Only in this way can we be worthy of being soldiers of the great Mao Zedong era and worthy of being the masters of the country. We can be like Comrade Xiang Xiuli, Tao Demei, and Xu Xuehui, who, in times of emergency, did not consider their personal lives and showed infinite loyalty to the Party, the people, and the socialist cause; like Comrade Zhan Shuijing of Dalian Shipyard, who, day after day for ten years, never missed a day of work, maintained the machines well, and continuously increased output and quality; like Comrade Xu Chenglong of Qingdao Timber Processing Plant, who tenaciously studied, broke through unexpected difficulties, and boldly created and innovated technology; like Comrade Liu Guangjin, a stoker at Beijing Power Plant, who worked diligently, loved the factory like his home, mastered the performance of the equipment, operated safely for more than 1,000 days, and saved a lot of fuel coal; like Comrade Luo Shuzhen, a delivery worker at the Beijing Post Office Branch, who was conscientious and responsible, worked hard and complained without complaint, and made extraordinary achievements in ordinary work; and we can also be like Lao Mengtai, Yi Shijuan, the Mao Zedong Locomotive crew, the Ma Hengchang team, and the Liu Jiuxue coal mining team, who have always maintained their advanced honor. We will definitely be able to make heroic achievements like the advanced units and advanced producers across the country, and create earth-shaking achievements together with all the workers and the people of the whole country.

Collectivism is the characteristic of the socialist system. Only by giving full play to the strength of the collective can we develop socialism at high speed.

Li Jiebo emphasized that collectivism is the characteristic of our socialist system. He said: Socialist cause is a collective cause of the whole people. Only by giving full play to the strength of the collective can we develop socialism at high speed. Now, the socialist labor competition of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced" has further developed into the socialist labor competition of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward," which shows that this collectivist ideology is being increasingly promoted, and shows that the communist awareness of the broad masses of workers is being increasingly improved. We hope that every advanced unit and advanced producer will firmly remember the Central Committee's earnest advice in its congratulatory message: "Not only should we be humble and prudent, learn modestly, and strive to maintain the advanced title of our units and ourselves, but also we should promote the communist style and help other units and people catch up with the advanced level." At the same time, we also hope that every ordinary producer will exert their drive, learn from the advanced, and quickly raise their level to the advanced level. This movement of "catching up with the advanced and helping the backward" by millions of producers, and the common effort to eliminate backward phenomena, is the great driving force for the continuous Great Leap Forward of our country's socialist construction. We must be like the countryside, which not only has high yields per unit area, but also has large-scale harvests, so that the advanced level can be quickly transformed into the level of social production through the socialist labor competition of "comparing, learning, catching up, and helping."

Li Jiebo said: Another manifestation of this collectivist ideology is the spirit of communist collaboration. Under the idea of the whole country as one chess game, we must not only launch and organize mutual collaboration within enterprises, but also organize mutual support and joint collaboration between various enterprises, various departments, various industries, and various regions. This is an important measure to promote the continuous upsurge of production. Since the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership and education of the Party, communist collaboration has emerged everywhere. Within enterprises, between upper and lower processes, between upper and lower shifts, and between various departments; between factories and mines; between production units, transportation units, and supply and marketing units; and between various industries and regions, they create conditions for each other, you help me, I help you, cooperate closely, and support each other. The scope of collaboration is unprecedentedly wide, and the forms of collaboration are rich and colorful. Everyone has shown great selflessness, putting others before oneself, leaving difficulties to oneself, and giving convenience to others. This inspiring atmosphere of collaboration and noble style not only demonstrates the noble qualities of our working class and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, but also fully taps the potential of production, enabling the socialist economy to leap forward at high speed and proportionally. The "one-dragon" collaboration jointly launched by the Fuxin Coal Mine, the railway, and the Qinhuangdao Port increased the coal transportation efficiency by 14%, which is equivalent to adding 1,800 railcars and a 7,200-ton cargo ship. The nationwide "one-dragon" collaboration in transportation and postal and telecommunications departments, as well as the large and small collaborations between many other departments and units, have greatly improved work efficiency. Communist collaboration has also strengthened the unity of the working class. Everyone is united and working together in the same direction, shoulder to shoulder on the road of building socialism, advancing from victory to victory.

We must be good at learning various advanced experiences, and creatively apply and promote these advanced experiences so that our talents can be fully utilized.

Li Jiebo said: Our advanced producers dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, so that technical revolution and technical innovation can emerge endlessly. However, creation does not come from nothing. Creation and learning are always inseparable. We must respect science and study diligently in order to overcome difficulties and achieve victory. We must earnestly learn from the experience of our predecessors, learn from existing advanced experiences, and learn from the experience of the Soviet Union and all fraternal countries. By combining theory with practice and creatively applying and promoting these advanced experiences, our talents can be fully utilized. Our Huang Rongchang, Wang Fengen, Wei Gaohou, and countless innovation experts have all shone with their genius and made amazing innovations on the basis of learning from existing experience and continuously improving their cultural and technical skills. Our scientific workers and engineering and technical personnel must also exert their drive and truly achieve both redness and expertise, and contribute their scientific and technical knowledge to the great cause of socialist construction. The "three-in-one" system of leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and workers that is now being promoted in enterprise management is precisely the most effective method to give full play to collective wisdom and combine politics and technology, leadership and the masses, and scientific knowledge and labor practice to continuously carry out technical innovation.

Finally, Li Jiebo said: Comrades, there are only two months left until the end of the year. The current urgent task is to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, further implement the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on opposing right-leaning, encouraging drive, and practicing increased production and economy, consolidate and continuously launch a new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy, not only to ensure the early completion of this year's national plan and the early completion of the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan, but also to actively prepare for next year's production, break the "routine" of "slack at the beginning of the year and tight at the end of the year" and "slack at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month," and truly achieve "a red start," "red every ten days," "red every month," and "a full house of red," laying the foundation for leap forward every year in the future and creating all the necessary conditions for realizing the historical tasks put forward by the Party Central Committee.

### 鼓足更大干劲，跃进，再跃进  全国总工会副主席李颉伯在群英会上讲话

    鼓足更大干劲，跃进，再跃进
    全国总工会副主席李颉伯在群英会上讲话
    新华社31日讯　中华全国总工会副主席李颉伯今天在全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会上作了题为“鼓足更大干劲，跃进，再跃进”的讲话。他首先指出：现在，党中央向我们发出了伟大的战斗号召。要求我们在十年左右时间内在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国；并且特别强调指出，要求我们在同一时间内，尽快地实现农业技术改造，使农业实现机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化，把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业结合起来。这是党交给全国工人阶级的极其光荣的伟大任务，我们一定要把这个任务完满地实现。
    革命干劲是社会主义建设的无价之宝。只要发挥冲天的革命干劲，就能不断创造生产奇迹
    我们广大职工群众愈来愈深刻地认识到：只要我们在党和毛主席领导下，坚持政治挂帅，高举党的总路线的红旗，在各个战线上大搞群众运动，我们就一定能够大跃进，我们就一定能够胜利地实现党所提出的历史任务。作为党联系群众的引带的工会组织，就应该在党的领导下，高举党的总路线红旗，大搞群众运动，把实现党所提出的历史任务变成广大群众的自觉行动，使广大职工中愈来愈多的人成为执行党的总路线的先锋。
    李颉伯说：党的总路线的本质就是要最大限度地发挥人的作用，就是要我们发挥冲天的革命干劲，就是要我们广大职工和全国人民在各个生产建设的战线上用无比高度的劳动热情，贡献出自己全部力量和智慧，以超乎寻常的速度大搞社会主义建设。大跃进以来的伟大实践告诉我们，革命干劲正是社会主义建设的无价之宝，是实现生产大跃进的决定因素。只要我们鼓足了革命干劲，就能利用一切有利条件积极战胜困难，就能使技术革命和技术革新放出奇光异彩，就能使生产纪录日日刷新，生产奇迹不断创造。本溪钢铁公司第一炼铁厂在大跃进中把两座“老掉牙齿的高炉”的利用系数，从1957年的一点三一五，提高到二点零零七，二点五七七，并创造了突破三点零大关的奇迹，就是很好的证明。
    同志们，我们说革命干劲是生产跃进的决定因素，这是不是说，我们可以不顾客观物质技术条件，超越客观可能去办实在办不到的事？不，不是的，党从来就主张革命热情要和科学分析相结合，要经常注意客观条件的可能性。可是，怎样才能真正认识客观条件，运用客观条件呢？我们马克思列宁主义者认为，只有首先鼓足了革命干劲，才能对客观事物进行深入全面的探讨，才能产生真正的科学分析，才能充分认识和掌握客观条件，千方百计地运用客观条件，变不利为有利，化困难为顺利。这些道理已经为大跃进以来无数事实所证明。“难字当头、寸步难行，干字当头、日行千里”，干劲不足，即使有着十分有利的条件，也会感到困难重重，一鼓足干劲，就能认识客观条件，排除重重困难，打开跃进局面。
    要保持冲天的革命干劲，就要不断提高共产主义觉悟，发扬工人阶级百折不挠的革命坚定性
    李颉伯说：要保持我们的冲天干劲，一条重要的经验就是不断提高我们的共产主义觉悟，在社会主义和共产主义伟大事业中立下雄心大志，大大发扬我们工人阶级百折不挠的革命坚定性。我们工人阶级是伟大历史的创造者，是顶天立地的社会主义建设者。我们既然能在共产党和毛主席领导下依靠自身的力量翻了身，当了国家和社会的主人，我们就一定能够在党的领导下，用自己的双手和智慧建成一个伟大的社会主义国家。我们完全应当显示出我们是伟大国家的伟大工人阶级，为社会主义、共产主义勇往直前，对党、对人民赤胆忠心。以一天等于二十年的步伐，以敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，以“叫河水让路，要高山低头”的气魄，不断革命，不断前进。我们怕不怕紧张呢？不怕。我们要和资本主义国家争时间，比速度，要在最短的时间内，把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，自然得紧张一点，不鼓足干劲，就不紧张了吗？不，同志们，不鼓足干劲，就是不要总路线，就是要我们永远过“一穷二白”的日子，永远受帝国主义的威胁，那才是真正的紧张。为了摆脱这种紧张，我们要在今天鼓足干劲，紧张劳动，为子孙万代缔造幸福。在我们前进的道路上总是会出现这样或那样的困难，战胜困难，才能取得胜利。我们工人阶级就是要千方百计地去积极克服困难，乘风破浪地前进，决不向困难低头，从克服困难中练出本事。正因为我们对社会主义和共产主义事业有着这样大的决心和信心，所以成千上万的先进生产者才表现出崇高的自我牺牲精神，树立了不计报酬的共产主义劳动态度，发扬了全心全意为人民服务的精神。同志们！这正是工人阶级所应该具备的共产主义风格。只有这样，我们才不愧为伟大毛泽东时代的战士，不愧为国家主人翁这样一个身份。就能像向秀丽、陶德美、徐学惠同志那样，在紧急关头，毫不考虑个人的生命，表现出对党、对人民、对社会主义事业无限忠心；像大连造船厂詹水晶同志那样十年如一日，一日不欠勤，机器保养好，产量、质量不断上升；像青岛木材加工厂徐呈龙同志那样，顽强地钻研，突破意想不到的困难，大胆创造和革新技术；像北京发电厂司炉刘光金同志那样，勤勤恳恳，爱厂如家，掌握设备性能，安全运行一千多天，节约大量燃煤；像北京市邮局一支局投递员罗淑珍同志那样，认真负责，任劳任怨在平凡的劳动中作出不平凡的事业；也就能像老孟泰、裔式娟、毛泽东号机车包乘组、马恒昌小组、刘九学采煤队那样，始终保持先进荣誉。就一定能够像全国各个先进单位，先进生产者一样，作出英雄业绩；和全体职工，全国人民一起，创造翻天覆地的事业。
    集体主义是社会主义制度的特色。只有发挥出集体的力量，才能高速度地发展社会主义
    李颉伯强调指出，集体主义是我们社会主义制度的特色。他说：社会主义事业是全民的集体事业，只有发挥出集体的力量，才能高速度地发展社会主义。现在“比先进、学先进、赶先进”的社会主义劳动竞赛，已经进一步发展为“比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进”的社会主义劳动竞赛，说明这种集体主义思想正在日益发扬，说明广大职工的共产主义觉悟正在日益提高。我们希望每一个先进单位和先进生产者要牢牢记住这次中央在祝词中谆谆嘱告的：“不仅要不骄不躁，虚心学习，努力使自己的单位和自己保持先进称号，而且要发扬共产主义的风格，帮助别的单位和别人赶上先进的水平”。同时，我们也希望每一个普通生产者鼓足干劲，向先进看齐，迅速把自己的水平提高到先进的水平。这种千百万生产者的“赶先进、帮后进”的运动，共同努力为消除落后现象所进行的斗争，就是我国社会主义建设事业不断大跃进的伟大动力。我们要像农村一样，不仅有单位面积的高产，而且要有大面积的丰收，让先进水平经过“比、学、赶、帮”的社会主义劳动竞赛，迅速变为社会生产水平。
    李颉伯说：这种集体主义思想的另一表现，就是共产主义大协作的精神。在全国一盘棋的思想下，不仅要发动和组织企业内部的相互协作，而且要组织各个企业、各个部门、各个产业、各个地区之间的互相支援、共同协作。这是当前促进生产不断高涨的一项重要措施。大跃进以来，在党的领导和教育下，到处出现了共产主义大协作。企业内部上下工序、上下班次、各个部门之间，厂矿与厂矿之间，生产单位、运输单位、供销单位之间，各个产业之间、地区之间，互相创造条件，你帮我，我帮你，通力合作、互相支援，协作范围空前广泛，协作形式丰富多采。大家表现了大公无私，先人后己，把困难留给自己，方便让给别人。这种振奋人心的协作气象和崇高风格，不但显示了我们工人阶级的高贵品质，显示了社会主义制度的无比优越，而且能充分挖掘生产潜力，使社会主义经济得以高速度按比例地向前跃进。阜新煤矿、铁路和秦皇岛港口联合开展的“一条龙”大协作，使煤的运输效率提高了14％，相当于增加了一千八百个车皮，一艘七千二百吨的货船。全国风起云涌的交通、邮电部门的“一条龙”大协作，以及其他许多部门、单位之间的大小协作，莫不大大提高了工作效率。共产主义大协作，还加强了工人阶级的团结，大家结成一条心，拧成一股劲，在建设社会主义的大道上并肩携手，阔步前进，从胜利走向胜利。
    要善于学习各种先进经验，并创造性地应用和推广这些先进经验，我们的才智才能充分发挥
    李颉伯说：我们先进生产者敢想敢说敢干，技术革命和技术革新才能层出无穷。但是，创造不是凭空而来的，创造和学习总是不能分开的。要尊重科学，刻苦地学习，才能克服困难，取得胜利。我们要认真地学习前人的经验，学习已有的先进经验，学习苏联和一切兄弟国家的经验。结合实践，创造性地应用和推广这些先进经验，我们的才智才能充分发挥。我们在座的黄荣昌、王凤恩，魏高厚和无数革新能手，都是在学习已有经验，在文化技术不断进步的基础上，才闪耀出他们天才的光辉，作出惊人的创举。我们的科学工作者和工程技术人员，也要鼓足干劲，真正做到又红又专，把自己所学到的科学技术知识，贡献给社会主义建设的伟大事业。现在企业管理所推行的领导干部、工程技术人员、工人“三结合”的制度，正是发挥集体智慧，使政治和技术、领导和群众、科学知识和劳动实践相结合，不断进行技术革新的最有效方法。
    最后，李颉伯说：同志们，现在离年底只有两个月了。当前的迫切任务就是响应党中央的号召，进一步贯彻执行党的八届八中全会的关于反右倾、鼓干劲，厉行增产节约的决议，把增产节约运动的新高潮巩固持续地开展起来，不仅保证提前完成今年的国家计划和提前完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，并且要积极做好明年的生产准备工作，打破那种“年初松、年底紧”，“月初松、月底紧”的“常规”，真正做到“开门红”、“旬旬红”、“月月红”、“满堂红”，打下今后年年跃进的基础，为实现党中央所提出的历史任务创造一切必需的条件。
