Xinhua News Agency, November 9th: To meet the needs of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, medical and health workers in various regions, filled with revolutionary vigor, have been going in large numbers to the countryside, factories, and mountains. They are sending medicine to the production front lines, helping train health personnel at the grassroots level, and establishing mass medical and preventive organizations. This has brought about a vibrant situation in China's medical and health work.

Recently, large numbers of medical workers across the country have gone to the countryside and factories to support the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting) and the steel front. The provinces of Shaanxi, Sichuan, Shandong, and Henan alone have sent over 196,000 people, including doctors of Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and acupuncturists, many of whom are highly skilled experts.

Medical and health workers are going deep into the field, directly bringing medicine to the working masses of workers and peasants. In Hongya County, Sichuan Province, medical and health personnel formed 103 medical technology guidance groups and set up first-aid stations in canteens and fields at all production centers throughout the county, providing immediate consultations. They also carry out health education and technical guidance. The mobile medical teams in Qin County, Shanxi Province, carry general emergency medicines, medical equipment, and labor tools. Adhering to the principle of visiting every village and every area, they go wherever there are labor forces, treating illnesses, and conducting health education to publicize knowledge about disease prevention. In one week, they visited more than 120 villages. Some local people composed jingles praising the mobile medical teams, saying: "Mobile medical care is really good, sending medicine and ensuring health, autumn harvest will not be delayed, all thanks to the Party's good leadership."

Medical and health workers are also going deep into the grassroots to carry out health education, imparting medical techniques to the masses, and assisting in the establishment and enrichment of grassroots medical and health organizations, expanding the health front. After medical personnel from some medical units in Shanghai went to steel factories, they helped the medical organizations of some steel factories open new treatment departments in a short period. Under the guidance of doctors sent to the lower levels, medical personnel from Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 and No. 3 began to specialize in treating gynecological diseases for female workers. Many medical units in Beijing have established fixed contacts with grassroots medical organizations, systematically helping grassroots medical organizations train cadres and improve their skills. In rural areas, medical personnel going to the countryside and mountains are assisting local Party organizations in training a large number of grassroots health personnel and establishing mass health organizations. In Yizhang, Fenghuang, Changde and other counties in Hunan Province, medical personnel participating in rural mobile medical services have also assisted in training more than 4,800 rural health workers and nursery staff in addition to carrying out medical and disease prevention work.

    把医药送到生产前线　帮基层建立卫生组织
    大批白衣战士下乡下厂
    据新华社9日讯　各地医务卫生工作人员适应工农业生产跃进的需要，鼓起革命干劲，大批下乡下厂上山，把医药送到生产前线，在基层帮助培养训练卫生骨干，建立群众性的医疗预防组织，使我国的医药卫生工作，出现了一个生气勃勃的局面。
    最近以来，全国各地有大批白衣战士下乡下厂支援三秋（秋收、秋耕、秋种）和钢铁战线。单是陕西、四川、山东、河南四省已达十九万六千多人，其中有西医，也有中医和针灸医生，不少是技术水平相当高的名手。
    医务卫生工作人员深入现场，直接把医药送到工农群众中间。四川省洪雅县的医药卫生人员，组成的一百零三个医疗技术指导小组，在全县各生产中心的食堂、田间设立救护站，做到随到随诊，同时开展卫生宣传和技术指导工作。山西省沁县的巡回医疗小组，携带一般常用的急救药品、医疗器械和劳动工具，本着村村跑、块块到的原则，那里有劳动大军就到那里，有病治病，无病宣传预防疾病的卫生常识，一个星期就巡回了一百二十多个村庄。有些地方的群众编快板歌颂巡回医疗队说：巡回医疗实在好，送医送药健康保，秋收一点误不了，全是党的好领导。
    医务卫生工作人员深入基层，还开展卫生宣传，向群众传授医疗技术，协助建立并充实基层的医疗卫生组织，扩大卫生阵地。上海一些医疗单位的医务人员到钢铁工厂以后，在短时期内就帮助一些钢铁厂的医疗组织开设了新的治疗科目，上钢一厂、三厂的医务人员在下放医生的指导下开始为女职工们专门治疗妇女病。北京市许多医疗单位和基层医疗组织建立了固定联系，有步骤地帮助基层医疗组织培养干部，提高业务。在农村，下乡上山的医务人员协助当地党组织大量训练基层卫生骨干，建立群众卫生组织，湖南省宜章、凤凰、常德等县参加下乡巡回医疗的医务人员，除了开展医疗和预防疾病的工作外，最近还协助训练农村保健员、保育员等四千八百多人。
