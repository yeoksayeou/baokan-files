Xinhua News Agency Report: As the Algerian National Liberation War enters its sixth year, leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front and the Algerian Provisional Government have issued statements, reaffirming the determination of ten million Algerian people to persist in the struggle for national independence and against colonial rule.

Chawki Ahmed, the permanent representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front in Rabat, Morocco, told Xinhua News Agency reporters on November 1st that French leaders, in recent speeches, still adhere to colonialist principles. He pointed out, "Self-determination requires first the withdrawal of French troops and a fundamental change in the administrative system. We value actions, not empty words."

He pointed out that the strength of the Algerian National Liberation Army is growing stronger with each battle, and the just cause of the Algerian people has received the support of all countries in the world. The French colonialists have been constantly defeated and are becoming increasingly isolated.

Algerian Provisional Government Foreign Minister Amin Debaghine told Middle East News Agency reporters on November 1st that the Algerian people are ready to negotiate with France, but there are two important conditions: namely, the legitimate implementation of self-determination without any pressure from France and guaranteeing the integrity of Algerian territory.

The Foreign Minister said that the Algerian people are not only opposed to France but also to the entire Western imperialism. France receives military and spiritual support from other imperialist countries, especially during past United Nations General Assembly discussions on the Algerian issue, the whole world saw other imperialist countries supporting France's war of aggression against the Algerian people.

Speaking of the de Gaulle Plan, Debaghine said that this plan, announced under pressure of continuous defeats for France, was only aimed at misleading world opinion. He also said that the United States and other Western countries paved the way for this plan in order to maintain their own interests in Asia and Africa. He said that therefore, the connection between the talks between de Gaulle and Eisenhower and the de Gaulle Plan is obvious.

Algerian Provisional Government Minister of Cultural Affairs Taoufik El Madani announced on the evening of November 1st that the French demand for a "period of calm" before negotiations is essentially a demand for the Algerian people to surrender, but the Algerian National Liberation Army will continue to fight and force France to recognize Algerian independence through struggle – if not through negotiation. El Madani also said that five years of struggle have shattered the notion of "French Algeria," enabling Algeria to establish its government and declare to the world that it will soon gain its rightful place among the free nations of the world.

Recalling the defeat suffered by the French army in the Kabylia region this summer, El Madani said that although de Gaulle was forced to recognize Algeria's right to choose self-determination, he attached conditions to "self-determination" that were worse than imperialism itself.

He continued, "We tell France, let us negotiate a military and political solution on a government-to-government basis to pave the way for the implementation of genuine self-determination. We ask this because experience makes us doubt the outcome of voting under the pressure of French imperialism." He said, "Given France's rejection of this demand, France alone must bear the responsibility for further bloodshed."

Meanwhile, the Algerian people's just struggle has received increasing support and sympathy. The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council issued a statement on November 1st, expressing full support for the heroic struggle of the Algerian people against imperialism and for national independence.

The Secretariat's statement, issued as the Algerian people's armed struggle for national independence entered its sixth year, said that there is no doubt that the Algerian people's struggle will be recorded in history; at the same time, the people will ultimately triumph over violence and oppression.

The statement praised the Algerian people's heroic struggle as "a struggle that inspires all peoples suffering from imperialist oppression."

The statement emphasized that all the peoples of Asia and Africa support the Algerian people until their hopes are realized, and their hopes are also the hopes of all peace-loving peoples.

An editorial published in the Iraqi "People's Unity" newspaper on November 1st said: "The Algerian people's struggle will be immortalized as one of the important struggles in modern history" because the Algerian people are waging the most intense struggle in the Arab countries' struggle against colonialism and for independence.

The Iraqi "Al-Shaab" and "Al-Watan" newspapers also pointed out that France's actions to suppress the Algerian people's struggle are futile. "Al-Shaab" pointed out that the reactionary actions of the French ruling group in appointing de Gaulle and undermining the French democratic system to suppress the Algerian people's struggle have failed. The newspaper also condemned the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for supporting France's colonial war to suppress the Algerian people with weapons and money.

The Cairo "Al-Gomhuria" newspaper said on November 1st that despite France's barbaric suppression and inhumane torture of the heroic Algerian people's uprising, the Algerian people's unwavering struggle for freedom has not been interrupted as a result, but on the contrary, it is more resolute than in the past. An editorial in "Al-Ahram" said that although the Algerian people encountered great difficulties at the beginning of the revolution, the tide has now turned, and because France stubbornly insists on continuing to unjustly rule Algeria, it is now paying a heavy price. The newspaper called on de Gaulle to end the war so that his country would not fall into the terrible fate of complete destruction.

An editorial published in the Moroccan "Al-Tahrir" on November 2nd regarding the radio speech of Algerian Provisional Government Prime Minister Abbas on October 31st said that the importance of Prime Minister Abbas's speech lies in the fact that it was made when France was vigorously promoting the Frenchification of Algeria and Algeria's belonging to France. In his speech, Abbas reaffirmed Algeria's attitude and expressed that the Algerian National Liberation Army would remain vigilant until the Algerian people could freely choose their own destiny.

    阿尔及利亚人民进入解放战争第六年
    坚持斗争　争取独立
    民族解放军愈战愈强
    全世界舆论同声支援
    法国殖民者日益孤立
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在阿尔及利亚民族解放战争进入第六年之际，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线和阿尔及利亚临时政府的负责人纷纷发表谈话，重申了一千万阿尔及利亚人民为民族独立、反对殖民主义统治而坚持斗争的决心。
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线驻摩洛哥拉巴特常设局局长沙维·艾哈迈德1日向新华社记者发表谈话说，法国领导人在最近发表的一些谈话中，还坚持着殖民主义原则。他指出，“自决首先要求撤走法国军队，并且要求根本改变行政制度。我们重视的是行动，而不是空话。”
    他指出，阿尔及利亚民族解放军的力量愈战愈强，阿尔及利亚人民的正义事业得到了全世界所有国家的支持。法国殖民主义者不断地遭到失败，他们越来越孤立了。
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府外交部长阿明·德巴金1日在向中东通讯社记者发表的谈话中说，阿尔及利亚人准备同法国进行谈判，但是有两个重要的条件：即正当地实行自决而不受法国的任何压力和保证阿尔及利亚领土的完整。
    这位外交部长说，阿尔及利亚人民不仅反对法国，而且也反对整个西方帝国主义。法国从其他帝国主义国家获得军事和精神上的支持，特别是在联合国大会过去讨论阿尔及利亚问题的时候，全世界都看到其他帝国主义国家支持法国对阿尔及利亚人民进行侵略战争。
    德巴金在谈到戴高乐计划时说，在法国不断地遭受失败的压力下被迫宣布的这个计划只是为了把世界舆论引入错误的方向。他还说，美国和其他西方国家为这个计划铺平了道路，以便保持它们自己在亚洲和非洲的利益。他说，因此戴高乐和艾森豪威尔所进行的会谈同戴高乐计划之间的联系是显而易见的。
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府文化事务部部长陶菲克·迈达尼1日晚上宣布说，法国提出的在谈判以前有一个“平静时期”的要求实质上是要求阿尔及利亚人民投降，但是阿尔及利亚民族解放军将继续进行战斗，并且通过斗争——如果不是通过谈判的话——来迫使法国承认阿尔及利亚的独立。迈达尼还说，五年的斗争已经粉碎了“法属阿尔及利亚”的这种说法，使阿尔及利亚能够建立它的政府，并且向全世界宣布，它将很快在世界自由国家中取得正当的地位。
    迈达尼在回顾法国军队今年夏天在卡比利亚地区发动的攻势中所遭到的失败时说，虽然戴高乐被迫承认阿尔及利亚有权利抉择自决，但是他在“自决”上附加条件，这种条件比帝国主义本身更坏。
    他继续说，“我们告诉法国，让我们在政府级的基础上谈判一项军事和政治方面的解决办法，以便为执行真正的自决铺平道路。我们所以要求这样做是因为经验使得我们怀疑在法帝国主义的压力下进行投票的结果。”他说，“鉴于法国拒绝这种要求，因此只能单由法国来负进一步流血的责任。”
    同时，阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争得到越来越多的支持和同情。亚非人民团结理事会书记处1日发表声明，表示完全支持阿尔及利亚人民反对帝国主义和争取民族独立的英勇斗争。
    书记处在阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的武装斗争进入第六年时发表的声明中说，毫无疑问，阿尔及利亚人民的斗争会列入史册；同时，人民最终肯定会战胜暴力和压迫。
    声明称颂阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争是“使一切遭受帝国主义压迫的人民得到鼓舞的斗争。”
    声明强调说，全体亚非人民支持阿尔及利亚人民，直到他们的希望得到实现时为止，他们的希望也是全体爱好和平的人民的希望。
    伊拉克“人民团结报”1日发表的社论说：“阿尔及利亚人民的斗争将作为现代历史上的重要斗争之一永垂不朽”，因为阿尔及利亚人民所进行的是阿拉伯国家人民为反对殖民主义和争取独立而进行的斗争中的最激烈的斗争。
    伊拉克“国民报”和“国家报”也指出，法国镇压阿尔及利亚人民的斗争的行动是徒劳无益的。“国民报”指出，法国统治集团任命戴高乐和摧残法国民主制度以图镇压阿尔及利亚人民的斗争的反动行动已经失败。这家报纸还谴责美国和北大西洋公约组织以武器和金钱支持法国镇压阿尔及利亚人民的殖民战争。
    开罗“共和国报”1日说，尽管法国对英雄的阿尔及利亚人民起义采用了野蛮的镇压手段和不人道的苦刑，但是阿尔及利亚人民为取得自由而坚持不渝的斗争并没有因此而中断，相反地比过去更坚决了。“金字塔报”的社论说，虽然在革命开始时阿尔及利亚人民遭遇到很大的困难，但是现在潮流已经改变了，由于法国顽固地坚持继续非正义地统治阿尔及利亚，它现在正在付出沉重的代价。这家报纸要求戴高乐结束这场战争，从而使他的国家不致陷入彻底毁灭的可怕命运。
    摩洛哥“解放报”2日就阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯10月31日的广播演说发表的一篇社论说，阿巴斯总理这篇演说的重要意义在于，它是正当法国在大肆宣传阿尔及利亚法国化和阿尔及利亚归属法国的时候发表的。阿巴斯在演说中重申阿尔及利亚的态度，并表示阿尔及利亚民族解放军将保持警惕，直到阿尔及利亚人民能自由地选择自己的命运那天为止。阿尔及利亚民族解放军战士受到人民欢迎阿尔及利亚民族解放军女战士
