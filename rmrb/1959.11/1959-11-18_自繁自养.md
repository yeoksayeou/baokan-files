Raising crops requires planting seeds, and raising pigs also requires "planting."

Where do the piglets come from? Historically, most areas relied on a few producing areas for the supply of piglets. This was a phenomenon formed during the era of the small peasant economy, where ordinary farmers were unable to raise sows. In today's era of large-scale pig farming, relying on a few producing areas to supply piglets is obviously not feasible. At the same time, purchasing piglets from other places requires long journeys, which can easily lead to deaths and high costs. In particular, pigs from other places can easily cause epidemics, which have caused significant losses in some areas!

Self-breeding and self-raising is a fundamental measure to solve the problem of piglet supply. After the Yuxi Commune in Fuqing County implemented the policy of self-breeding and self-raising, the rate of pig development increased from the original 10% per year to 25%. This is a powerful proof of fact. In order to solve the source of piglets, the Yuxi Commune has adopted a set of effective methods such as "keeping all sows, selecting after keeping," which can be used as a reference for various places.

### 自繁自养

    自繁自养
    种庄稼要种，养猪也要种。
    猪种哪里来？历史上大部地区是依靠少数产地供应仔猪。这是小农经济时代，一般农民无力饲养母猪所形成的现象。在大量发展养猪的今天，依靠少数产地供应仔猪，显然是不行了；同时向外地购买仔猪要经过长途跋涉，容易造成死亡，成本也高，特别是外地猪容易引起疫病，这在某些地区曾经造成很大的损失！
    自繁自养是解决仔猪的一项根本性措施。福清县渔溪公社执行自繁自养的方针后，猪的发展速度由原来每年增长10％上升到25％，这是一个有力的事实证明。渔溪公社为了解决仔猪的来源，采取了“见母必留，先留后选”等一套行之有效的办法，可以供各地参考。
