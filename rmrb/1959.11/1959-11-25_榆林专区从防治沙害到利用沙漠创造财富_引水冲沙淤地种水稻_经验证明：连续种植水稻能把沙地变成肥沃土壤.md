Yulin Prefecture Transforms Sand Damage Prevention into Desert Wealth Creation
Diverting Water to Flush Sand and Silt for Rice Cultivation
Experience Proves: Continuous Rice Planting Can Turn Sandy Land into Fertile Soil

(Our Dispatch) The people of Yulin Prefecture in northern Shaanxi have launched a comprehensive transformation of the desert. Currently, along the ancient Great Wall line, on the southern edge of the Mu Us Desert, in a sandy area stretching over a thousand li from east to west, more than 300,000 people are delving deep into the desert's interior, vigorously diverting water to flush sand and create silt land, constructing canals and reservoirs, and carrying out crash programs for land preparation and afforestation.

The masses in the Yulin area once used their diligent hands to create a green belt for the desert. Now, they are determined to create a silver water belt for this sandy area, which is over a hundred li wide and six hundred li long. The ten large canals that have already started construction or are about to start construction are 696 li long. The ten larger reservoirs can hold more than 540,000 cubic meters of water. After these projects are completed, they will not only prevent desert movement but also transform two million mu of sand dunes into rice paddies, and the 100,000 mu of reservoirs will be able to raise fish.

The northern part of Yulin Prefecture is located on the southern edge of China's famous Mu Us Desert, extending from Dingbian in the west to Shenmu in the east. Along the ancient Great Wall line, there are one sand dune after another. The desert accounts for one-third of the total area of the prefecture. Before liberation, the rolling sand moved southward, constantly engulfing large areas of farmland and houses and transporting large amounts of sediment to the Yellow River. The Wuding River basin alone transported more than 200 million tons of sediment to the Yellow River each year, accounting for 15.75% of the total amount of sediment entering the Yellow River each year. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the local people, from mutual aid teams to agricultural cooperatives, launched a heroic struggle against the desert using collective strength. Over the past ten years, they have afforested five million mu, accounting for one-quarter of the total desert area. A windbreak and sand-fixing forest belt of six hundred li, from Zhengdadun in Dingbian in the west to Erlintu in Shenmu in the east, has basically been formed, preventing the desert from moving southward.

During the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement, the desert control struggle in this area opened a new page—shifting from defense to offense. During the Great Leap Forward and the large-scale water conservancy movement, people urgently demanded the rapid, good, and economical control of the desert, not only to control it but also to use the desert to create wealth. Several years of experience have proved that to conquer the shifting desert, it is necessary to combine large-scale control with consolidation and utilization. During the agricultural cooperative period, only small sections and small points were controlled around houses, farmland, and roads, and only trees and grass were planted. Because trees and grass have a certain growth process, they cannot immediately resist wind and sand erosion. During the large-scale water conservancy movement, the masses discovered that the local water resources were extremely rich and the water level was relatively high, which provided excellent conditions for large-scale water control of the desert. The four desert canals currently under construction, such as the Yuhui Canal and the Xiangshui Canal, can turn 40,000 mu of desert into fertile land.

Using water to control sand is a great creation of the masses in this area. The current characteristics of desert control in this area are shifting from defense to offense, from the edge of the desert to the interior, and from simply controlling sand damage to utilizing the desert to create wealth. Just the Yudong and Yuxi desert canals, in the process of construction from last year to the present, have diverted water to flatten sand dunes and level land totaling more than 8,000 mu. This year, the grain crops first sown on the 24 mu of sandy land newly flushed and silted in Pujialiang by the Yudong Canal yielded an average of 150 jin per mu, with the highest reaching more than 800 jin. The experience of planting grain in various regions has proved that these sandy lands can be planted with rice, and planting rice can gradually turn sandy land into fertile soil year by year. The general situation is: In the first year, one mu of sandy land can yield more than 100 jin of rice, and the sand grains change from light yellow to dark yellow; in the second year, rice can yield more than 200 jin, and the sand grains change from yellow to black; when rice is planted in the third year, it can yield 300 to 400 jin, and the sandy land becomes black fertile land, and any grain can be planted. Desert reservoirs can raise a large number of fish. This year, the entire prefecture released more than 1.63 million fish fry in 100,000 mu of reservoirs and haizi. After water enters the desert, a large number of sand willows, sand sagebrush, and sand bamboo quickly grow. Also, due to the effect of water, the sand is not easily blown up by the wind, and the sand dunes beside the reservoirs and canals are gradually flattened by the wind and filled into the reservoirs.

    榆林专区从防治沙害到利用沙漠创造财富
    引水冲沙淤地种水稻
    经验证明：连续种植水稻能把沙地变成肥沃土壤
    本报讯　陕北榆林专区人民向沙漠展开了全面改造工作。目前，在沿古长城一线，毛乌素沙漠南缘东西长达一千多华里的沙区，有三十多万人深入沙漠腹地，大搞引水冲沙淤地，建筑水渠和水库，突击整地，植树造林。
    榆林地区的群众，曾经用自己勤劳的双手，给沙漠系了一条绿色的林带；现在还决心给这块百余里宽、六百余里长的沙区腹地，系上一条银色的水带。目前已经动工和将要动工的十个大水渠长达六百九十六华里，十个较大的水库可容水五十四万多公方。这些工程完成后，不仅能制止沙漠流动，而且可使二百万亩沙丘变为稻田，十万亩水库能够养鱼。
    榆林专区北部处在我国著名的毛乌素大沙漠南缘，西迄定边，东至神木，沿古长城一线，都是一个接一个的沙丘。沙漠占全区总面积三分之一。解放前流沙滚滚南移，不断吞没了大片农田、房屋，并给黄河输送大量泥沙。仅无定河流域每年给黄河输送的泥沙达两亿多吨，占整个黄河每年输入泥沙总量的15.75％。解放后当地人民在党和人民政府领导下，由互助组到农业社，用集体力量向沙漠展开了英勇的斗争，十年来共造林五百万亩，占沙漠总面积的四分之一。西自定边郑大墩东到神木耳林兔六百华里的一条防风围沙护田林带，已经基本上形成，制止了沙漠南移。
    在大跃进和人民公社化中，这个地区的治沙斗争揭开了新的一页——由防御转为进攻。在大跃进和大搞水利运动时，人们迫切要求多快好省的治理沙漠，不但治而且要利用沙漠创造财富。几年的经验证明，要征服流动沙漠，必须大片治理和巩固、利用相结合。农业社时期，只在房屋、农田、道路旁一小段、一小点的治理，而且只是植树种草，因为树木和草有一定的生长过程，不能马上抵御风沙侵袭。大搞水利运动中，群众发现当地水的资源极为丰富，而且水位较高，这就为大规模以水治沙提供了优越条件。现在兴修的榆惠渠、响水渠等四条沙漠水渠，可以把四万亩沙漠变为良田。
    以水治沙是这个地区群众的伟大创举。目前这个地区治沙的特点是，由防御到进攻，由沙漠边缘到腹地，由单纯治沙害而成为利用沙漠创造财富。只是榆东、榆西两条沙漠水渠，在从去年到现在的修建过程中，已经引水冲平沙丘和平整的土地达八千多亩。瀑家梁今年在榆东渠新冲淤的二十四亩沙地上，第一次播种的粮食作物，平均每亩产一百五十多斤，最高达到八百多斤。各地区种植粮食的经验都证明，这些沙地能种植水稻，而种植水稻后又能逐年把沙地变为肥沃的土壤。一般的情况是：第一年一亩沙地水稻能收一百多斤，沙粒由浅黄变深黄；第二年水稻可收二百多斤，沙粒由黄变黑；种第三年水稻时，就能收三、四百斤，沙地就成为黑色肥沃土地，而且什么粮食都能种植了。沙漠的水库可以大量养鱼，今年全区在十万亩的水库、海子中放养鱼苗一百六十三万多尾。水进了沙漠之后，大量的沙柳、沙蒿、沙竹都很快生成起来。也由于水的作用，沙子不易被风吹起，而在水库、水渠旁的沙丘，也逐渐被风削平，填到水库去了。（吴钢）
