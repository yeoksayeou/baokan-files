    Land reclamation army arrives, heaven laughs and earth also laughs, cotton like silver mountains, grain like gold, cattle and sheep everywhere, horses in herds. Don't say the scenery of Jiangnan is good, barren mountains and bald ridges must be remodeled.

    垦荒（民歌）垦荒大军到，天笑地也笑，棉似银山粮似金，牛羊遍地马成群。莫道江南风光好，荒山秃岭要改装。
