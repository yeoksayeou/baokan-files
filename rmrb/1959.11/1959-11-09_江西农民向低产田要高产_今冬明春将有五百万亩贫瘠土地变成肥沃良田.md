    Jiangxi Peasants Seek High Yields from Low-Yield Fields: Five Million Mu of Barren Land to be Transformed into Fertile Farmland This Winter and Spring
    (Our report) Jiangxi's 500,000 peasants have launched a soil improvement campaign, determined to change the face of five million mu of low-yield land this winter and spring.

    Currently, people in various parts of Jiangxi are working vigorously in low-yield fields and on the mountain slopes and barren ridges beside them, engaging in deep plowing in winter, accumulating and creating fertilizer, and building water conservancy projects. In the Fuzhou Special District, 100,000 commune members climb mountains and wade through water every day to cut green grass, burn ash, and pile fertilizer for the transformation of low-yield fields. More than 10 million manure pits or compost piles have been established near low-yield fields. In Yushan County, Shangrao Special District, more than 2,000 pig farms have been built near low-yield fields, raising 160,000 fat pigs specifically for accumulating and creating fertilizer for low-yield fields. In Jiujiang Special District, 50,000 commune members worked hard for a week, planting green manure on all one million mu of low-yield fields. The Gannan Administrative Region and the Ji'an Special District plan to build more than 100 water conservancy projects for low-yield fields this winter and spring, and construction has started in full swing. In Yichun Special District, 50,000 commune members are vigorously engaged in deep plowing in winter in low-yield fields, with deep plowing reaching about seven inches in Jinxi County of this special district, covering more than 200,000 mu of low-yield land.

    After the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee put forward the battle call to mobilize one million commune members to transform five million mu of low-yield land this winter and spring, party committees at all levels immediately strengthened their leadership over this work. Special districts, counties, and people's communes held professional meetings and mass mobilization rallies. A "double competition and double contest" upsurge of "comparing energy, competing in measures, comparing progress, and competing in quality" swept the province.

    Under the principle of payment according to labor and equivalent exchange, special districts, counties, and people's communes widely carried out collaboration, mutually adjusting labor and tools, and helping each other overcome various difficulties in soil improvement.

    Jiangxi Province has 36 million mu of paddy fields, of which 12 million mu are low-yield fields (with a rice yield of only dozens to one hundred catties per mu), accounting for one-third of the total area of paddy fields. The main reasons for low yields are: the soil lacks organic matter and has poor structure; there is a lot of red soil; cultivation is extensive, fertilization is limited, and there is a lack of water conservancy facilities, making it prone to drought and flood. Since liberation, the province has transformed six million mu of low-yield fields, increasing the per-mu yield of rice to 300 or 400 catties. In Dongxiang County, 100,000 mu of low-yield fields used to grow only one season of mid-season rice, with a maximum per-mu yield of 120 catties; after the transformation, double-cropping rice was planted this year, with an average per-mu yield of nearly 500 catties for the two seasons, an increase of more than three times. In Jinxi County, all 220,000 mu of wheat fields are red soil. In 1956, the average per-mu yield was less than 40 catties; after the transformation last winter, the per-mu yield of wheat this year was 111 catties. These achievements have greatly encouraged the masses' confidence in improving the soil.

    Various places have also mobilized the masses to summarize their past experience in soil improvement and formulated specific measures to realize the soil improvement plan for this winter and spring: First, adhere to putting politics in command and launch a large-scale mass movement; second, continue to implement the policy of combining improvement and utilization, and in accordance with the principles of less labor, less investment, quick results, and high returns, classify the soils that need to be improved, take the easy ones first, and carry out the improvement in stages and batches. Third, vigorously carry out tool reform, modify and promote deep plowing and water lifting tools, requiring deep plowing to reach six to seven inches, and ensuring that the quality of deep plowing meets the standards for every mu. Fourth, according to the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture and existing experience, formulate and implement comprehensive technical measures for soil improvement according to local conditions, implement continuous improvement and comprehensive improvement, and thoroughly improve the soil. Fifth, use methods such as visits, on-site meetings, and mass forums to continuously summarize and disseminate the advanced experience of soil improvement in various places and promote the soil improvement movement.

    Due to advanced plans, specific measures, strong leadership, and full enthusiasm of the masses, the province's soil improvement movement is surging higher every day, like a force that cannot be stopped. Party committees at all levels unanimously believe that the grand plan to improve five million mu of low-yield land this winter and spring can be fully realized. (Liu Guanghui)

    江西农民向低产田要高产
    今冬明春将有五百万亩贫瘠土地变成肥沃良田
    本报讯　江西五十万农民掀起了改良土壤运动，决心在今冬明春改变五百万亩低产田的面貌。
    现在江西各地人民正在低产田里和低产田旁的山坡、荒岭上大闹深耕冬翻、积肥造肥和兴修水利。抚州专区每天有十万社员登山涉水，为改造低产田打青割草，烧灰堆肥，已在低产田旁建立了一千多万个粪窖或堆肥。上饶专区的玉山县为了改造低产田，在低产田旁建起了二千多个养猪场，饲养了十六万头肥猪，专为低产田积肥造肥。九江专区五万社员奋战一周，在一百万亩低产田里全部种上了绿肥。赣南行政区和吉安专区计划今冬明春为低产田修建一百多座水利工程，已全面开工。宜春专区有五万社员在低产田里大闹深耕冬翻，这个专区的进贤县二十多万亩低产田深耕在七寸左右。
    江西省委提出今冬明春动员一百万社员改造五百万亩低产田的战斗号召后，各级党委立即加强了对这一工作的领导，专区、县和人民公社纷纷举行了专业会议和群众誓师大会，“比干劲、赛措施，比进度、赛质量”的“双比双赛”竞赛热潮席卷全省。
    在按劳计酬、等价交换的原则下，各专区、县和人民公社之间广泛开展了协作，互相调剂劳力、工具，互相帮助克服改良土壤中的各种困难。
    江西省有三千六百万亩水田，其中有一千二百万亩低产田（亩产水稻仅几十斤到一百来斤），占水田总面积的三分之一。低产的主要原因有：土壤中缺乏有机质，结构不好；红壤多；耕作粗放，施肥少，缺少水利设施，易旱易涝。解放以来全省已经改造了六百万亩低产田，水稻亩产量提高到三百斤、四百斤。东乡县十万亩低产田，过去只种一季中稻，最高亩产量一百二十斤；经过改造后今年改种双季稻，两季平均亩产量近五百斤，增产三倍多。进贤县二十二万亩小麦田全部是红壤，1956年平均亩产量不足四十斤；经过去冬的改造，今年亩产小麦一百十一斤。这些成绩大大鼓舞了群众改良土壤的信心。
    各地还发动群众总结了以往改良土壤的经验，制定了实现今冬明春改良土壤计划的具体措施：一、坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动；二、继续贯彻改良和利用相结合的方针，本着花工少、投资小、收效快、收益大的原则，把需要改良的土壤分类排队，采取先易后难的办法，分期分批地进行改良。三、大搞工具改革，改制与推广深耕、提水工具，要求深耕达到六至七寸、亩亩深耕质量符合标准。四、根据农业八字宪法和已有的经验，因地制宜地制定与执行改良土壤的综合技术措施，实行连续改、综合改，彻底改良土壤。五、运用参观访问、开现场会和群众座谈会等办法，不断总结、传播各地改良土壤的先进经验，推动改良土壤运动。
    由于计划先进，措施具体，领导有力，群众干劲十足，全省改良土壤运动日日高涨，势如破竹。各级党委一致认为，今冬明春改良五百万亩低产田的宏伟计划完全可以实现。　（刘光辉）
