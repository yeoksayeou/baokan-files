Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: In close coordination with the current movement against rightist tendencies, to boost morale, increase production and practice economy, and the education movement on the socialist general line, Beijing is vigorously carrying out workers' amateur cultural activities, forming a new mass upsurge to welcome the great year of 1960 and the arrival of the Spring Festival. This was the call made to all city workers at the Beijing Municipal On-Site Conference on Workers' Amateur Cultural Work held on the 11th.

The on-site conference, sponsored by the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, was held at the Beijing Rolling Stock Depot of the Beijing Railway Bureau. Attending the conference were the secretaries in charge of cultural work from various districts and counties of Beijing, leaders of the Communist Youth League and trade unions, and heads of Party, League, and trade union organizations from factories, mines, enterprises, construction, and transportation units, totaling more than 500 people.

Chang Wen, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Beijing Rolling Stock Depot, Li Yihe, Director of the Depot, and activists in amateur cultural activities introduced the situation and experience of the depot's workers in carrying out amateur cultural work. This depot is responsible for the maintenance and repair of passenger cars and the manufacture of some parts for the five major trunk lines of Jing-Shan, Jing-Guang, Jing-Zhong, Jing-Lan, and Jing-Bao, as well as the China-Soviet, China-Mongolia, and China-Korea international joint transportation. For five consecutive months this year, the depot has won the production red banner of the Beijing Railway Bureau and the "Ten-Year Safety Pacesetter" red banner of the Ministry of Railways. With the continuous leap forward in production, workers' amateur cultural activities have also greatly developed. In the past ten months, the entire depot has held 26 literary and artistic performances, totaling 209 programs, two-thirds of which were created by the workers themselves. More than 1,400 workers, 40% of them regularly participate in cultural activities, and many amateur literary and artistic activists are also production experts.

The main experiences of this depot in achieving success in amateur cultural activities are: First, strengthening the leadership of the Party and resolutely implementing the policy of literature and art serving proletarian politics, serving socialist construction, and serving the masses in its work. Under the unified leadership and arrangement of the Party committee, amateur cultural work is effectively coordinated with the current political movements and production tasks. For example, after the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, the workers immediately arranged literary and artistic programs centered on publicizing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session to help the masses deeply understand the basic spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session. During the great efforts of August and September, many advanced figures emerged, and cultural life was filled with amateur literary and artistic creations and performances such as small vocal performances, clapper talks, and poetry recitations mainly praising advanced figures. These programs were short and concise, often rehearsed at noon and performed in the evening, quickly spreading advanced ideas and stimulating the workers' enthusiasm for production. For example, the small vocal performance "The Most Lovable People are Heroic Models" praised the advanced thinking of advanced producer Wang Bingxiang in combining with veteran workers to engage in technological revolution. When Wang Bingxiang saw that he was being praised, he said that he must continue to work hard and skillfully. Soon, he and the veteran workers jointly researched and successfully created electric shears, increasing production efficiency by 39 times. Second, adapting to local conditions and seizing the opportune moment, with workshops as the base for carrying out cultural activities. After receiving monthly and quarterly production tasks, many workshops often used various literary and artistic forms to promote competitions. In the middle of each month, small-scale literary and artistic performances are used to celebrate achievements and commend advanced figures.

Many Party branch secretaries and workshop directors of the workshops actively take the lead in participating in cultural activities. For example, the Party branch secretaries of the Vehicle Electric and Repair Workshops have both taken the stage as actors, and the director of the Repair Workshop serves as a musical accompaniment and director. They have powerfully promoted amateur cultural activities. These activities are mostly done less when busy and more when idle. In the activities, the creativity and enthusiasm of the masses are fully utilized, and the mass line is followed. They decentralize literary and artistic activists to the workshops, adopting a combination of decentralized and centralized leadership, and using a variety of literary and artistic forms to attract the masses to voluntarily participate in cultural activities. They also strengthened the training of literary and artistic activists by holding various training classes. The principle of diligence and thrift is implemented in carrying out cultural activities.

Chen Kehan, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, spoke at the meeting on the current development of amateur cultural activities among workers in Beijing. He believed that amateur cultural activities in various industrial and mining enterprises, construction sites, and people's communes are developing vigorously and gradually becoming more in-depth and regularized. Many units have new leadership methods in this regard and have accumulated rich experience. The Beijing Rolling Stock Depot is one of the better units. Chen Kehan pointed out that the problem that is often encountered in carrying out amateur cultural activities is the relationship with production, work, and study. Revolutionary cultural work is a part of the entire revolutionary cause, and it must serve and serve socialist revolution and socialist construction. Mass amateur cultural activities, because of their amateur nature, should especially pay attention to the role of cooperation and promotion in production, work, and study.

Finally, Chen Kehan requested that leaders in industrial and mining enterprises, transportation, and construction sites actively carry out amateur cultural education work. In particular, grassroots units such as cultural centers, clubs, television stations, film projection teams, bookstores, and libraries must resolutely face factories and rural areas, regularly go deep into workers, peasants, and soldiers, enthusiastically carry out guidance work, and set off a new upsurge of mass cultural activities to warmly and happily welcome the New Year's Day and Spring Festival of 1960.

    北京积极开展职工业余文化活动
    市委文化部召开现场会议推广北京车辆段的经验
    据新华社11日讯　密切配合当前反右倾、鼓干劲、增产节约运动和社会主义总路线的教育运动，把北京市职工业余文化活动轰轰烈烈地开展起来，形成一个群众性的新的高潮，以迎接伟大的1960年和春节的到来。这是11日举行的北京市职工业余文化工作现场会议向全市职工提出的号召。
    由中共北京市委文化部主办的这个现场会议，是在北京铁路局北京车辆段召开的。参加会议的有北京市各区、县委主管文化工作的书记，共青团和工会的负责人，各厂矿企业、建筑、交通运输等单位的党、团、工会负责人等五百多人。
    北京车辆段党委书记常文、段长李义合以及业余文化活动积极分子在会上介绍了该段职工开展业余文化工作的情况和经验。这个车辆段担负着京山、京广、京重、京兰、京包五大干线和中苏、中蒙、中朝国际联运客车的保养维修和部分配件的制造任务。今年连续五个月来，车辆段获得了北京铁路局的生产红旗和铁道部十年安全标兵红旗。随着生产的不断跃进，职工业余文化活动也有了很大的发展。十个月来全段共举办了二十六场文艺演出，共二百零九个节目，其中三分之二的节目是职工自己创作的。一千四百多名职工，有40％经常参加文化活动，不少业余文艺工作积极分子，同时也是生产上的能手。
    这个车辆段业余文化活动取得成绩的主要经验是：首先加强党的领导，在工作中坚决贯彻了文艺为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义建设服务，为群众服务的方针。在党委统一领导和安排下，使业余文化工作有效地配合当前的政治运动和生产任务来进行。如党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布以后，职工们立刻编排了以宣传八中全会精神为中心的文艺节目，帮助群众深入了解八中全会的基本精神。在大干8、9月中涌现了许多先进人物，文化生活中就大量出现以歌颂先进人物为主的小演唱、快板、诗歌表演等业余文艺创作和演出。这些节目短小精悍，往往中午排晚上就演出，很快地传播了先进思想，激发了职工的生产热情。如小演唱“最可爱的人是英雄模范”，歌颂了先进生产者王秉香与老工人结合大搞技术革命的先进思想，王秉香一见表扬了他，就表示一定要继续大干巧干；不久，他又与老工人一起研究成功了电剪子，生产效率提高三十九倍。其次，因地因时制宜，以车间作为开展文化活动的根据地。许多车间接到月、季度生产任务以后，常常运用各种文艺形式来推动比武。每月中旬，又利用小型的文艺演唱来庆功，表扬先进人物。
    很多车间的党支部书记和车间主任积极带头参加文化活动，如车电和修配车间的党支部书记都登台做过演员，修配车间主任又担任乐器伴奏，又当导演。他们有力地推动了业余文化活动。这些活动，都是忙时少搞，闲时多搞。活动中充分发挥群众的创造性和积极性，走群众路线。他们把文艺积极分子下放到车间，采取分散与集中领导相结合的方式。并用多种多样的文艺形式来吸引群众自愿地参加文化活动。他们还加强了对文艺积极分子的培养，举办各种训练班。在开展文化活动中贯彻勤俭节约的原则。
    中共北京市委书记处书记陈克寒在会上对当前北京市职工开展业余文化活动讲了话。他认为目前各工矿企业、建筑工地和人民公社的业余文化活动正在蓬蓬勃勃地展开，并逐步趋向深入和经常化。许多单位在这方面有了新的领导方法，积累了丰富的经验。北京车辆段就是比较好的单位之一。陈克寒指出，在开展业余文化活动中，经常碰到的问题是同生产、工作和学习的关系问题。革命的文化工作是整个革命事业的一部分，它必须服从和服务于社会主义革命和社会主义建设。群众业余文化活动，因为是业余性质，就尤其要注意对生产、工作、学习起配合和促进作用。
    最后，陈克寒要求工矿企业、交通运输和建筑工地等方面的领导人，要把业余文化教育工作积极开展起来。特别是各文化馆、俱乐部、电视站、电影放映队、书店、图书馆等基层单位要坚决面向工厂农村，经常深入工农兵，热情地进行辅导工作，掀起一个群众文化活动的新高潮，热热闹闹、欢欢喜喜地迎接1960年的元旦和春节。
