    Plant High-Efficiency Red Flags Across Water Conservancy Construction Sites
    “Oppose rightism, boost morale, work hard this winter and spring, and accelerate the realization of water conservancy!” This is the battle cry put forward by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Party after winning a bumper harvest in agriculture following the victory over extraordinary natural disasters. A red-hot high tide of water conservancy construction has already formed.
    The characteristic of this year's mass movement for water conservancy construction is "striving for high efficiency from the very start." The directives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on launching large-scale water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaigns this winter and next spring pointed out that water conservancy work should "vigorously promote tool reform and technological innovation, gradually realize construction mechanization and semi-mechanization, and carry out a high-efficiency campaign." This is the general direction for water conservancy construction this winter and next spring. The earth and stone work tasks for this year's water conservancy projects are enormous, and the tasks of winter agricultural production are also very heavy. It is neither appropriate nor possible to transfer too much labor to participate in water conservancy construction. Therefore, only by vigorously engaging in technological reform, improving labor organization, and increasing labor efficiency can we complete water conservancy construction tasks in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Taking the Ziyun Mountain Reservoir construction site in Jiangxi Province (news report in the first edition of this newspaper on November 17) as an example, after reforming tools and innovating technologies, work efficiency has increased tenfold, and the construction period has been shortened by one year. The manpower, materials, and financial resources previously used to build one reservoir can now be used to build two reservoirs. More importantly, the 300,000 mu of farmland around the reservoir can benefit one year earlier, which, calculated at an increase of 100 jin per mu, can increase grain production by 30 million jin per year.
    At present, the development of the high-efficiency movement is still uneven. There is still a large gap between the efficiency of advanced units and the national average efficiency. In the Fuhuai Xinhe River project in Anhui, the Zhang Youdao Youth Assault Team vigorously promoted tool reform. From November 6th to 20th, in half a month, the average daily work efficiency per person reached a high record of 28.1 cubic meters. Doesn't this precisely illustrate that every construction site in the country has tremendous potential? Every construction site must strive to meet the advanced efficiency quotas, improve labor productivity through tool reform and technological innovation, do more earth and stone work, and require fewer people. If we can increase the national average efficiency by 30%-50% on the existing basis, this will not only further accelerate the progress of the project, but also be equivalent to adding tens of millions of laborers.
    In order to achieve high efficiency, what aspects need to be addressed? First, adhere to the policy of walking on two legs, combining indigenous methods with foreign methods, and combining semi-mechanization with mechanization. Under current conditions, on a national scale, we can only focus on improving tools and light machinery, and gradually increase the proportion of heavy machinery. On small construction sites, we must first achieve vehicle-ization and widely promote various simple equipment that flies in the sky and pushes on the ground. On large and medium-sized construction sites, we must first develop light machinery and strive to achieve transport rail-ization, excavation pneumatic-ization, and so on. On construction sites that already have modern mechanical equipment, we must learn to master modern machinery, give full play to the potential of machinery, and achieve a high degree of mechanized joint operations and automation. Therefore, only by adopting the policy of walking on two legs, combining indigenous methods with foreign methods, and combining semi-mechanization with mechanization can the efficiency of large, medium, and small construction sites be comprehensively improved. The Ziyun Mountain Reservoir construction site in Jiangxi Province implemented this policy. After adopting indigenous-made winches and earth-transporting trains powered by steam engines and charcoal water pumps, work efficiency was greatly improved. For example, the average work efficiency of transporting earth to the dam using a high-dam earth-transporting winch was increased sixtyfold; the work efficiency using a long-distance earth-transporting double-track train was increased twelvefold; and one machine using a car-pulling machine to bring five manual cars up the dam at a time replaced the labor of ten people. Such tool reforms and technological innovations can be achieved in all regions. Now, many counties and many people's communes have their own machinery factories or farm implement repair shops, coupled with the strong support of national industry for agriculture, and there is now a certain amount of mechanical power in rural areas. As long as we are good at using these forces, fully mobilize and rely on the masses, obtain materials locally, manufacture them locally, and use indigenous methods to promote foreign methods, we will definitely be able to accelerate the realization of semi-mechanization and mechanization of water conservancy construction.
    Second, the tool reform and technological innovation of water conservancy construction sites must develop from one or two types of work or one or two processes to comprehensive reform, so that technological innovation develops into a widespread mass movement on many construction sites. Many places are doing this now. For example, in earthwork projects, it has developed from the innovation of earth-transporting tools to the comprehensive innovation of the entire process of digging, loading, transporting, unloading, and compacting. Water conservancy construction sites, especially large and medium-sized water conservancy construction sites, are like workshops in factories, with each type of work and each process linked to each other. If one link cannot keep up, it will affect other links; if one link changes, other links must also be improved accordingly. After the realization of vehicle-ization, if the digging tools and tamping tools are not improved, the supply of earth materials and the tamping speed will not be able to keep up, resulting in idle work and waste. After the realization of vehicle-ization, if the roads in the work area are still narrow and rugged, work efficiency cannot be significantly improved. In Xiuwen County, Guizhou Province, after mobilizing the masses to fully realize the earth mechanization of digging, loading, transporting, unloading, crushing, leveling, and compacting at all the 445 water conservancy construction sites that have started construction throughout the county, the average work efficiency has increased more than twofold. Projects that were originally planned to be completed in three years can now be completed in only about 100 days. The main method of organizing the high-efficiency movement is to widely carry out labor competitions centered on tool reform and technological innovation, and to organize observation and comparison in a timely manner. In the movement, we must not only carry forward the communist style of daring to think and daring to act by the masses, but also conduct serious scientific analysis, research, and experimentation; we must not only carry forward the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, but also pay attention to the lives of the construction workers on the construction site and the work of construction safety and hygiene. Only by having work and rest can we maintain a lasting fighting spirit.
    Third, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and vigorously carry out mass movements. Many places have opposed rightism, boosted morale, planted red flags, and set up pacesetters in water conservancy construction, so that the advanced can become more advanced, the backward can be helped, and catch up with the advanced, so that the mass movement can be vigorously carried out. The high-efficiency movement at the Ziyun Mountain Reservoir construction site developed under the leadership of the Party in the continuous struggle against right-leaning conservative ideas. When the construction site began to trial-produce indigenous-made winches and other improved machines, it was met with opposition from people with right-leaning conservative ideas, who said things like "local carpenters can't make foreign machines" and "the construction site has already realized vehicle-ization, and tool reform has reached its peak." However, the construction site Party committee was not shaken by these remarks, but firmly supported the suggestions of the innovators, established a technical innovation committee from top to bottom, and submitted the opinions of the right-leaning conservatives and the suggestions of the innovators to the masses for discussion. As a result, the masses posted more than 300 big-character posters, supporting the reform suggestions and criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas. In less than ten days, a high-dam earth-transporting winch was manufactured. From then on, the flower of technological revolution bloomed throughout the construction site, and work efficiency increased dozens of times. Countless facts in the high-efficiency movement in various regions prove that the wisdom of grassroots cadres and the people is infinite, and the potential for technological innovation is inexhaustible. For example, for earth-transporting tools, changing from carrying on shoulders and backs to transporting by car is an innovation; installing ball bearings on cars to realize bearing-ization is another innovation; creating rope-towing machines, winches, and using mechanical power to replace human labor is another innovation. As long as we thoroughly oppose rightist ideology, boost morale, the people will immediately take action, boldly innovate and create, and actively promote new technologies and new tools.
    Plant the red flag of the high-efficiency mass movement across the country's water conservancy construction sites! Let the work efficiency of national water conservancy projects increase and increase again on the basis of average advancement.

    把高工效的红旗插遍水利工地
    “反右倾，鼓干劲，大干一冬春，加速实现水利化”这是我国人民在党的领导下紧接着战胜特大灾害取得农业大丰收之后提出的战斗口号。一个热火朝天的水利建设高潮已经形成了。
    今年水利建设群众运动的特点是，“一上阵就争高工效”。中共中央和国务院关于今冬明春开展大规模兴修水利和积肥运动的指示中指出水利工作要：“大闹工具改革和技术革新，逐步实现施工机械化和半机械化，开展高工效运动”。这是今冬明春兴修水利的总方向。今年水利工程的土石方任务是巨大的，而冬季农业生产的任务也很繁重，不应当也不可能抽调过多的劳动力参加水利建设。因此，只有大搞技术改革，改善劳动组织，提高劳动效率，才能多快好省地完成水利建设任务。以江西紫云山水库工地（消息见本报11月17日第一版）来说，他们改革工具，革新技术以后，工效已经提高十倍，工期缩短一年，过去用来修建一个水库的人力、物力、财力，现在兴修两个水库。更重要的，这个水库周围的三十万亩农田可以提前一年受益，以每亩增产一百斤计算，一年可以增产三千万斤粮食。
    目前，高工效运动的发展还是不平衡的。先进单位的工效和全国平均工效相差还很大。安徽张友道青年突击队在符怀新河的工程中，大搞工具改革，从11月6日到20日半个月时间，每人平均日工效达到了二十八点一公方的高额纪录。这不正是说明全国每一个工地都有着极大的潜力吗？各个工地必须向先进的工效定额看齐，从工具改革、技术革新方面提高劳动生产率，多做土石方，少要人。如果我们能够把全国平均工效从现有基础上提高30％—50％，这不仅进一步加快了工程的进度，而且等于给增添了上千万个劳动力。
    为了实现高工效，需要从哪些方面入手呢？第一，坚持土洋结合、半机械化和机械化结合的两条腿走路的方针。在目前条件下，在全国范围内，只能以改良工具和轻型机械为主，逐步增加重型机械的比重。在小型工地，首先做到车子化，并大量推广天上飞、地上推的各种简易设备。在大、中型工地上，首先要发展轻型机械，争取做到运输轨道化、开挖风动化等等。在已经有现代化机械设备的工地，要学习掌握现代机械，充分发挥机械潜力，做到高度的机械化联合作业和自动化。因此，只有采取土洋结合、半机械化和机械化结合的两条腿走路的方针，大、中、小型工地的工效，才能全面地提高。江西紫云山水库工地就实行了这个方针，他们采用以蒸汽机、木炭抽水机为动力的土制卷扬机、运土列车以后，工效大大提高。例如使用了高坝运土卷扬机，运土上坝的平均工效就提高了六十倍；使用了远距离运土双轨列车，工效就提高了十二倍；使用了拉车上坝机一次能带动五部人力车上坝，一部机器代替了十个人的劳动力。这样的工具改革、技术革新是各地都有条件办到的。现在，许多县、许多个人民公社都有了自己的机械厂或农具修配厂，加上国家工业对农业的大力支援，目前农村又有了一定数量的机械动力。只要我们善于运用这些力量，充分发动和依靠群众，就地取材，就地制造，以土带洋，土洋并举，就一定能够加速实现水利施工的半机械化和机械化。
    第二，要使水利工地的工具改革和技术革新由一两个工种或一两个工序向全面改革发展，使技术革新在不少工地发展为广泛的群众运动。现在，许多地方都这样做了。例如在土方工程中，已从运土工具的革新，发展到挖、装、运、卸、压整个工序的全面革新。水利工地特别是大、中型水利工地同工厂的车间一样，各个工种、各个工序间是一环套一环的。一个环节跟不上，就会影响其它各个环节；一个环节有了变化，其它环节也必须作相应的改进。实现了车子化以后，挖土工具和夯压工具不改进，土料供应和夯压速度就会跟不上，产生窝工浪费现象。实现车子化以后，工区道路如果还是羊肠小道，崎岖不平，工效也不能显著提高。贵州省修文县在全县已经开工的四百四十五处水利工地上，挖、装、运、卸、碎、平、压，各个工序上，发动群众全部实现土机械化以后，平均工效提高了两倍以上。原来计划三年才能完成的工程，现在只需要一百天左右的时间就可以完成。组织高工效运动的主要方法是广泛地开展以工具改革、技术革新为中心的劳动竞赛，及时组织观摩评比。在运动中，既要发扬群众敢想、敢干的共产主义风格，又要认真进行科学的分析研究和试验；既要发扬群众的冲天干劲，又要注意工地民工生活和施工安全、卫生等工作。做到有劳有逸，才能保持持久的战斗情绪。
    第三，必须加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。许多地方在水利建设中反右倾、鼓干劲、插红旗、树标兵，使先进的能够更先进，落后的得到帮助，赶上先进，使群众运动蓬勃开展。紫云山水库工地的高工效运动，就是在党的领导下不断的与右倾保守思想斗争中发展起来的。当工地开始试制土卷扬机等改良机具的时候，就遭到有右倾保守思想的人的摇头反对，说什么“土木匠做不了洋机器”“工地已经实现车子化，工具改革到了顶”。但是工地党委并没有被这些言论所动摇，而是坚定地支持了革新者的建议，从上到下成立了技术革新委员会，并把右倾保守派的意见和革新者的建议一齐交给群众讨论。结果群众贴出了三百多张大字报，支持了改革的建议，批判了右倾保守思想。不到十天的功夫，就把一部高坝运土卷扬机制造出来。从此，技术革命之花开遍了全工地，工效数十倍地提高。各地高工效运动的无数事实证明，基层干部和人民群众的智慧是无限的，技术革新的潜力是无穷的。例如运土工具，把肩挑背背改为车子运输是一次革新；把车子装上滚珠轴承实现轴承化又是一次革新；创造绳索牵引机、卷扬机、用机械动力代替人的劳动，又是一次革新。只要把右倾思想反透，干劲鼓足，人民群众就会立即行动起来，大胆进行革新、创造，积极推广新技术、新工具。
    把高工效群众运动的红旗插遍全国水利工地！让全国水利工程的工效在平均先进的基础上提高、再提高。
