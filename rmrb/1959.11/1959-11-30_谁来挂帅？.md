Who Shall Take Command?
　　Shang Zhen
　　A small group of right-leaning opportunists within our Party, standing in opposition to the Party and the people, have opposed the Party's general line on a series of fundamental issues and launched attacks against the Party. This is the case on the fundamental issue of "politics in command."
　　"Oppose politics in command" is one of the reactionary slogans used by right-leaning opportunists to attack the Party. The most important question regarding politics in command is "who shall take command"—is it the proletariat's politics in command, or the bourgeoisie's politics in command? When certain bourgeois revolutionaries within our Party loudly shout "oppose politics in command," it is precisely to oppose the Party's Marxist-Leninist leadership, to oppose the proletariat's leadership, and to attempt to transform the Party according to the bourgeoisie's image, thereby realizing the bourgeoisie's politics in command.
　　"Who shall take command" is a major issue that concerns the success or failure of the Party and the people's cause, and the destiny of the nation. The Chinese Communists and the Chinese people have a profound understanding and experience of this major issue of right and wrong. We deeply know that the victory of the Chinese revolution is precisely the victory of Marxism-Leninism, precisely the victory of the great thought of "the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution," represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, which is to say, the victory of the proletariat's politics in command. Our personal experience is that: whatever we do following the road indicated by the proletarian political party (the Communist Party) and its great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, we are always victorious; whenever we violate the instructions of the proletarian political party and its great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, we suffer setbacks, even serious failures. For more than thirty years, the history of our country's people's democratic revolution has repeatedly proved this point, and for ten years, the history of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction has continued to prove this point.
　　During the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, "who shall take command," the proletariat's politics in command or the bourgeoisie's politics in command, is the key to determining the victory or defeat of the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. The proletariat's politics in command will carry the socialist revolution to the end and make the socialist construction cause continue to leap forward; the bourgeoisie's politics in command will make the socialist cause fall by the wayside and pave the way for the bourgeoisie's restoration. The bourgeois rightists' attack on the Party from the outside in 1957 and the right-leaning opportunists' attack on the Party from the inside now are essentially attempts to replace the proletariat's politics in command with the bourgeoisie's politics in command, and to replace socialism with capitalism. However, "a mantis trying to stop a chariot" can never prevent the rapid advance of the wheels of history. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, our country's socialist cause has developed rapidly, especially since 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line, opening up a situation of great leaps forward. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in August this year, the struggle to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale has developed the situation of continued leaps forward to a higher stage, once again powerfully proving that the proletariat's politics in command is invincible and all-conquering.
　　Within the Hunan Party organization, there is also a small group of right-leaning opportunists who viciously attack the Party's leadership and the proletariat's politics in command, linking their opposition to the Party's leadership with their opposition to the dictatorship of the proletariat. Historical facts are precisely like this: the Kuomintang's "governing the country by the party" is a symbol of the dictatorship of the landlord class and the bureaucrat-bourgeoisie, and in all bourgeois dictatorial countries in the world, the bourgeois political party is in a position of "absolute" rule. Our opposition to the Kuomintang's "governing the country by the party" is precisely to oppose the dictatorship of the landlords and the bureaucrat-bourgeoisie, and the proletariat and all oppressed people in capitalist countries oppose the "absolute" rule of the bourgeois political parties precisely to oppose the bourgeois dictatorship. Proletarian revolutionaries do not generally oppose "dictatorship," but only oppose the dictatorship of a minority of exploiters and aggressors over the vast working people and oppressed nations. Proletarian revolutionaries steadfastly advocate that: not only must we unite all exploited and oppressed people to overthrow the dictatorship of a minority of exploiters and aggressors, but we must also establish and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and only through the historical period of the dictatorship of the proletariat can we realize socialism. "Those 'socialists' who talk about democracy apart from the dictatorship of the proletariat are actually standing on the side of the bourgeoisie and opposing the proletariat, and are actually demanding capitalism and opposing socialism." (Once More on the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat) Now our country is a people's democratic country led by the proletariat, a country of the dictatorship of the proletariat. "Our dictatorship is called the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. This shows that we implement a democratic system within the people, and the workers unite all people with civil rights, first of all the peasants, and exercise dictatorship over the reactionaries, reactionaries and elements who resist socialist transformation and socialist construction." (Mao Zedong, "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") May I ask, without such a dictatorship, what socialism is there? From this, it can be seen that the absolute leadership of the Communist Party, the dictatorship of the proletariat, and socialism are three in one and inseparable. This is precisely the objective law of social development, precisely the Marxist-Leninist social science. If someone says, "I only oppose the absolute leadership of the Communist Party, but I do not oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialism," it is tantamount to a robber raising a broadsword and saying to someone, "I only want to cut off your head, and your life and property are absolutely safe."
　　In Hunan, there are countless examples proving that: the proletariat's politics in command leads to the prosperity of the socialist cause; the bourgeoisie's politics in command allows the demons of capitalism to run rampant. For example, before the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, right-leaning opportunists spread pessimistic sentiments everywhere, saying that we would not be able to continue to leap forward this year. Under the ideological influence of right-leaning opportunism, some comrades wavered and slackened off, lacking confidence in the completion of the plan, and even those comrades who had confidence and drive felt "great pressure." After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, a widespread and in-depth struggle to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale was launched, and people's mental state was completely renewed, with a new high tide of the movement to increase production and practice thrift surging forward. In agriculture, we overcame the extraordinary drought and insect pests, creating the miracle of late rice surpassing early rice and matching middle rice, and achieving an all-round bumper harvest of grain, cotton, oil, and various economic crops; in industry and transportation, the total industrial output value and various major indicators can be completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule; in finance, economics, and trade, the task of grain procurement can also be completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule. The economy is prosperous, and trade is booming. For example, in individual counties, right-leaning opportunists once gained the upper hand. While attacking the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, they forcibly ordered the large-scale dissolution of public canteens. Landlords, rich peasants, and a portion of well-to-do middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas took the opportunity to rise up, attacking the People's Communes and openly calling for taking the capitalist road. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the broad masses of peasants, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants who account for more than 70% of the rural population, actively supported the Party's call, repelled this capitalist countercurrent, and restored and consolidated public canteens and consolidated the People's Communes on a voluntary basis.
　　The matter is laid out like this: whether to follow the bourgeoisie and take the capitalist road, or to follow the proletariat and take the socialist road. Taking the capitalist road requires the bourgeoisie's politics in command, and taking the socialist road requires the proletariat's politics in command. The two must be chosen; there is no road without politics in command.
　　Now the people of the whole country, especially the peasants, are closely following the proletariat's banner—the glorious banner of Mao Zedong—and advancing victoriously. All Party comrades are closely united around the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. We hope that those very few comrades whose thoughts have gone astray or have not yet enlisted can also rejoin the ranks or enlist and catch up quickly.

    谁来挂帅？
    尚真
    我们党内有一小撮右倾机会主义者，站在同党和人民相对立的地位，在一系列根本问题上反对党的总路线，向党进攻。在“政治挂帅”这个根本问题上，就是如此。
      “反对政治挂帅”，这是右倾机会主义者向党进攻的反动口号之一。政治挂帅的最重要的问题是“谁来挂帅”，是无产阶级的政治挂帅，还是资产阶级的政治挂帅？当我们党内的某些资产阶级革命家，高喊“反对政治挂帅”的时候，正是为了反对党的马克思列宁主义的领导，反对无产阶级的领导，妄想按照资产阶级的面貌来改造党，实现资产阶级的政治挂帅。
    “谁来挂帅”，这是关系着党和人民事业的成败，关系着国家命运的大问题。中国共产党人，中国人民，对于这个大是大非的问题，有着深刻的感受和体会。我们深知中国革命的胜利，正是马克思列宁主义的胜利，正是以毛泽东同志为代表的“马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命具体实践相结合”的伟大思想的胜利，也就是无产阶级政治挂帅的胜利。我们的切身经验是：凡是按照无产阶级的政党（共产党）和它的伟大领袖毛泽东同志所指示的道路前进，就无往不胜；凡是违背了无产阶级政党和它的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的指示，就要遭受挫折，甚至严重的失败。三十多年来，我国人民民主革命的历史，反复地证明了这一点，十年来，我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的历史，继续证明着这一点。
    在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，“谁来挂帅”，是无产阶级的政治挂帅，还是资产阶级的政治挂帅，这是决定社会主义和资本主义这两条道路的斗争谁胜谁败的关键。无产阶级的政治挂帅，就要把社会主义革命进行到底，使社会主义建设事业不断跃进；资产阶级的政治挂帅，就要使社会主义事业半途而废，为资产阶级的复辟开辟道路。1957年资产阶级右派从外部向党进攻和现在右倾机会主义者从内部向党进攻，其实质都是妄想用资产阶级的政治挂帅代替无产阶级的政治挂帅，用资本主义代替社会主义。但是：“螳臂当车”决不能阻挡历史巨轮的飞速前进。我国的社会主义事业，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，飞速发展，特别在1958年以来，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，开辟了大跃进的局面。今年8月的八届八中全会以后，反右倾、鼓干劲的斗争，使继续跃进的形势发展到更高的阶段，又一次有力地证明了无产阶级的政治挂帅，是战无不胜、攻无不克的。
    在湖南的党组织内，也有一小撮右倾机会主义者，恶毒地攻击党的领导，攻击无产阶级的政治挂帅，他们把反对党的领导和反对无产阶级专政联结在一起。历史的事实正是这样：国民党的“以党治国”是标志着地主阶级和官僚资产阶级的专政，而世界上一切资产阶级专政的国家，都是资产阶级的政党处于“绝对”的统治地位。我们反对国民党的“以党治国”正是为了反对地主和官僚资产阶级的专政，资本主义国家的无产阶级和一切被压迫的人民，反对资产阶级政党的“绝对”统治，正是为了反对资产阶级专政。无产阶级革命家，不是一般地反对“专政”，而仅仅反对少数剥削者和侵略者对于广大劳动人民和被压迫民族的专政。无产阶级革命家坚定不移的主张是：不但要联合一切被剥削和被压迫的人民，推翻少数剥削者和侵略者的专政，而且要建立和巩固无产阶级的专政，只有通过无产阶级专政的历史时期，才能实现社会主义。“那些离开无产阶级专政而高谈民主的‘社会主义者’，实际上是站在资产阶级方面而反对无产阶级，实际上是要求资本主义而反对社会主义。”（再论无产阶级专政的历史经验）现在我们的国家是无产阶级领导的人民民主国家，是无产阶级专政的国家。“我们的专政，叫做工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。这就表明，在人民内部实行民主制度，而由工人阶级团结全体有公民权的人民，首先是农民，向着反动阶级、反动派和反抗社会主义改造和社会主义建设的分子实行专政。”（毛泽东“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”）试问如果没有这样的专政，还有什么社会主义呢？由此可见，共产党的绝对领导、无产阶级专政和社会主义，是三位一体而不可分割的，这正是社会发展的客观规律，正是马克思列宁主义的社会科学。如果有人说：“我只反对共产党的绝对领导，并不反对无产阶级专政和社会主义。”那就等于一个强盗举起大刀向人说：“我只要砍掉你的脑袋，你的生命、财产是万无一失的。”
    在湖南，有无数的实例证明：无产阶级的政治挂帅，社会主义的事业就繁荣兴旺；资产阶级的政治挂帅，资本主义的妖魔就兴风作浪。例如在八届八中全会以前，右倾机会主义者，到处散布悲观情绪，说今年不能继续跃进。在右倾机会主义的思想影响下，有些同志动摇、松劲，对计划的完成缺乏信心，连那些有信心有干劲的同志，也感到“压力很大”。八届八中全会以后，广泛地深入地开展了反右倾、鼓干劲的斗争，人们的精神状态焕然一新，增产节约运动的新高潮汹涌澎湃。农业方面，战胜了特大的干旱和虫害，创造了晚稻超早稻、赛中稻的奇迹，获得了粮、棉、油以及各项经济作物的全面大丰收；工业交通方面，工业总产值和各项主要指标，可以提前和超额完成，财经贸易方面，粮食征购任务也可提前超额完成。经济繁荣、贸易兴旺。又如在个别县份，右倾机会主义者曾经一时占了上风，他们在攻击党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社的同时，强迫命令大量解散公共食堂。地主、富农和一部分有严重资本主义思想的富裕中农，乘机而起，攻击人民公社，明目张胆地号召走资本主义道路。八届八中全会以后，广大农民群众，特别是占农村人口70％以上的贫农和下中农，积极拥护党的号召，打退了这一股资本主义的逆流，在自觉自愿的基础上，恢复和巩固了公共食堂，巩固了人民公社。
    事情就这样摆着：是跟着资产阶级走资本主义道路，还是跟着无产阶级走社会主义道路，走资本主义道路就得由资产阶级的政治挂帅，走社会主义道路就得由无产阶级的政治挂帅，二者必择其一，没有政治挂帅的道路是没有的。
    现在全国人民，首先是农民，紧紧地跟随着无产阶级的帅旗——毛泽东的光荣旗帜胜利前进。全党同志，紧紧地团结在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央周围。我们希望那些思想开了小差或者思想还没有入伍的极少数同志，也能重新归队或入伍，快步赶上来。
