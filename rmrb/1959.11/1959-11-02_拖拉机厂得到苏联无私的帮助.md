    Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 1st November: China's First Tractor Manufacturing Plant received comprehensive and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union during its construction.

    Even when the planning for this tractor factory was just beginning, the Soviet government sent experts to help select the factory site. Subsequently, the Moscow Automobile and Tractor Industry Design Institute, the Kharkov State Tractor and Agricultural Machinery Design Institute, the Kharkov Mechanized Transportation Design Institute, the Leningrad High-Frequency Research Institute, and the design department of the Kharkov Tractor Plant all participated in the factory's design work, supplying designs and technical data in a timely manner.

    Regarding equipment supply, seventeen cities and fifty-seven factories and enterprises in the Soviet Union provided the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant with equipment, tools, and technical data, ensuring early delivery and supply, adapting to the need to accelerate the factory's construction progress.

    Throughout the entire construction process, the Soviet government also sent thirty-eight outstanding experts in civil engineering, machinery, power, metallurgy, and technology to specifically assist in the factory's construction. In their work, they demonstrated a lofty spirit of internationalism, brotherly friendship, and selfless dedication. They also put forward more than six thousand suggestions during the construction process, which played a significant role in accelerating the completion of the factory and producing tractors ahead of schedule. At the same time, they actively passed on their knowledge, technology, and experience to the factory's workers and engineering technicians through methods such as actively mentoring apprentices and giving lectures.

    拖拉机厂得到苏联无私的帮助
    据新华社洛阳1日电　我国第一拖拉机制造厂在建厂过程中得到苏联全面无私的援助。
    还在这座拖拉机厂开始筹建的时候，苏联政府就派来专家帮助选择厂址。接着，苏联的莫斯科汽车拖拉机工业设计院、哈尔科夫国家拖拉机农业机械设计院、哈尔科夫机械化运输设计院、列宁格勒高周波研究院、哈尔科夫拖拉机厂的设计部门，都参加了这个厂的设计工作，及时地供应了设计和技术资料。
    在设备供应方面，苏联有十七个城市、五十七个工厂企业，为第一拖拉机制造厂提供了设备、工具、技术资料等，并且都做到了提前交货和供应，适应了加快建厂进度的需要。
    在整个建厂过程中，苏联政府还派来了土木建筑、机械、动力、冶金、工艺等方面的优秀专家三十八名，具体帮助了这个厂的建设工作。他们在工作中，都表现了崇高的国际主义精神、兄弟般的友谊和忘我的劳动品德。他们在建厂过程中还提出了六千多条建议，对于加快完成建厂任务和提前生产拖拉机，都起了很大的作用。同时，他们还以积极带徒弟、讲课等形式，把自己的知识、技术和经验，传授给这个厂的工人和工程技术人员。
