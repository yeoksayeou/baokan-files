    Smoke Inspires Gas-to-Oil Transformation
    Who hasn't seen smoke billowing from a chimney? But who would have thought that a major technological innovation could be inspired by the very plumes of smoke rising into the air!
    The story took place at the No. 3 Petroleum Factory of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry. One day, Li Shusheng, a young worker in the distillation workshop, was on his way home from work. Filled with the joy of labor, he leaned on the windowsill and gazed at the blue sky. The slow-moving white clouds in the sky indeed made him forget his fatigue and feel relaxed. He turned his gaze towards his own factory and saw thick smoke billowing from the tall chimney. A peculiar scene caught his attention.
    "Hey, why is the west heater emitting black smoke, while the east heater is emitting faint white smoke?" he couldn't help but ask himself. "Obviously, the east heater is burning fuel gas, while the west heater is burning gas from the atmospheric washing tank. The black smoke must be the result of the gas burning with oil." He made this judgment and said with a tone of regret, "How much light oil is being lost this way every year! We have to recover it; we can't let it go to waste!"
    The next day, as soon as he got to work, he found the workshop's administrative leaders and proposed an innovation to recover light oil from the gas of the atmospheric washing tank. The leaders immediately adopted his suggestion. From last winter to this spring, after a series of failures and more failures, it was finally confirmed that more than six kinds of high-grade products, such as gas gasoline, solvent oil, and petroleum ether, could be recovered from this gas. According to statistics, after this reform was put into production, it can recover 3,000 tons of products annually, worth more than 2 million yuan. Now, the factory's Party committee has decided to start experimental production using indigenous methods and formally incorporate his suggestion into the factory's development plan.

    浓烟启示气变油
    烟囱里冒烟谁没有见过，可是谁会想到就是从这嬝娜上升的浓烟里面，得到了技术革新的重大启示哩！
    事情发生在石油工业部石油三厂。一天，蒸馏车间青年工人李树生下班回家了，他带着劳动后的喜悦，伏在窗台上了望碧蓝的天边。空中几朵慢悠悠活动着的白云，确实使它忘记了疲劳，感到一身轻松。他收眼向自家工厂看去，高大的烟囱里，正喷吐着浓烟。一个奇特的景象把他吸引住了。
    “哎，为啥西加热炉冒黑烟，而东加热炉冒着淡淡的白烟？”他情不自禁地问自己。“很明显，东加热炉烧的是燃料瓦斯，西加热炉烧的是从洗涤常压槽出来的瓦斯，黑色烟子必定是瓦斯带油燃烧的结果。”他作出了这样的判断，带着可惜的口吻说：“这样一年要跑掉多少轻油啊！要收回来，不能让它白白跑掉！”
    第二天一上班，他就找到了车间行政领导，提出了从洗涤常压槽瓦斯中回收轻油的革新建议。领导上立即采用了他的建议。从去冬到今春，经过了一番失败再失败的曲折，终于证实能从这种瓦斯中回收气体汽油、溶剂油、石油醚等六种以上的高级产品。据统计，这项改革投入生产后，每年可回收三千吨产品，价值二百多万元。现在厂党委已决定开始用土法试验生产，把他的建议正式纳入工厂的发展规划。
