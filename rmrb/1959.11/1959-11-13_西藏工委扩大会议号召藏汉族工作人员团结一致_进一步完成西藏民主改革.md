    Tibet Work Committee Enlarged Meeting Calls on Tibetan and Han Staff to Unite and Further Complete Democratic Reform in Tibet
    (Our dispatch) The Tibet Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an enlarged meeting from September 24th to October 18th. The meeting conveyed the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Based on the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session, it summarized the achievements of the "Three Antis and Two Reductions" movement in Tibet in recent months, exchanged experiences, and discussed various policies and other related issues for the next step of reforming the land system. Zhang Jingwu, Secretary of the Tibet Work Committee of the CPC, and Zhang Guohua, Deputy Secretary, delivered reports at the meeting.
    After heated discussions, the meeting further enhanced the participants' understanding of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, the People's Communes, and the revolutionary mass movement, boosted the revolutionary enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres, and promoted the current vigorous democratic reform movement in Tibet.
    The meeting comprehensively analyzed the current situation in Tibet, believing that the "Three Antis and Two Reductions" movement carried out in agricultural areas in recent months has achieved great success. The situation in Tibet has undergone fundamental changes, and the class consciousness of the broad masses of working people has been significantly improved. A large number of activists have emerged in the movement, and 503 township peasant association organizations have been established, with more than 100,000 members. The advantage of the laboring masses in the countryside has been basically established, and they are urgently demanding to change the feudal serf owners' land ownership to peasant ownership. In the great democratic reform movement, upper-class people have also expressed their support. All of this shows that the situation for reforming the land system has arrived. The meeting called on all Tibetan and Han staff and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet to devote themselves to this great revolutionary movement with full enthusiasm, actively, and in a fighting stance.
    The meeting pointed out that because the class line of "relying on the laboring people, uniting all forces that can be united, and eliminating the feudal serf system" stipulated by the Central Committee was implemented and the masses were fully mobilized, the smooth progress of the first stage of the democratic reform, the "Three Antis and Two Reductions" movement, was guaranteed. In the second stage of democratic reform—the land reform movement—this class line must be unswervingly implemented.
    The meeting seriously discussed the redemption policy and specific redemption issues. It believes that the Central Committee's policy of confiscating the land, livestock, farm implements, houses, and other means of production of rebellious lords, and redeeming the land, livestock, farm implements, houses, and other means of production of non-rebellious lords, is completely correct. In this way, it is possible to both satisfy the land demands of the vast number of working peasants and unite all forces that can be united, maximizing the isolation of the reactionary feudal serf owners.
    The meeting also conducted in-depth research on how to do a good job in pastoral areas. In view of the fact that the situation in pastoral areas is very different from that in agricultural areas, the current tasks in pastoral areas are mainly to carry out anti-rebellion, anti-Ula corvee labor, and anti-enslavement, implement policies that benefit both herdsmen and herd owners, protect and develop livestock, and establish democratic political power, so as to achieve the goal of developing the pastoral economy and improving the lives of herdsmen. The meeting believes that this policy not only conforms to the current situation in pastoral areas, but also conforms to the Party's long-term work policy in pastoral areas. Doing this work well is as important as doing a good job in distributing land in agricultural areas.
    The meeting also discussed various policies and related issues such as united front work and industry and commerce in land reform.
    The meeting considered that after land reform, peasants have become the masters of the land, and their enthusiasm for production will inevitably be greatly improved. Therefore, in areas where land distribution has been completed or is underway, production for next year must be grasped now, so that next year's production will take a leap forward, and preliminary targets for increasing grain crops next year have been determined. The meeting demanded that reform and production should not be delayed, and that both reform and production should achieve bumper harvests.
    The meeting called on all Tibetan and Han staff and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet to unite as one, work hard, muster up full enthusiasm, work actively, fully mobilize the masses, correctly implement policies, and strive to complete the glorious task of democratic reform under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

### 西藏工委扩大会议号召藏汉族工作人员团结一致  进一步完成西藏民主改革

    西藏工委扩大会议号召藏汉族工作人员团结一致
    进一步完成西藏民主改革
    本报讯　中共西藏工委从9月24日到10月18日举行了扩大会议。会议传达了党的八届八中全会的决议，根据八中全会的精神，总结了西藏地区几个月来的“三反双减”运动的成绩，交流了经验，讨论了下一步改革土地制度的各项政策和其他有关问题。中共西藏工委书记张经武、副书记张国华，在会上作了报告。
    会议经过热烈的讨论，进一步提高了与会同志对总路线、大跃进、人民公社，以及革命群众运动的认识，鼓舞了广大干部的革命干劲，对西藏地区当前轰轰烈烈的民主改革运动起了推动作用。
    会议全面地分析了当前西藏地区的形势，认为几个月来在农业地区进行的“三反双减”运动，已经取得很大成绩。西藏的形势发生了根本的变化，广大劳动群众的阶级觉悟有了显著的提高，运动中涌现出的大批积极分子，成立了五百零三个乡农民协会组织，会员达十万余人。劳动群众在农村中的优势，基本上树立了起来，他们迫切要求改变封建农奴主的土地所有制为农民所有制。在伟大的民主改革运动中，上层人士也纷纷表示赞成。这些都说明：改革土地制度的形势已经到来了。会议要求全体藏、汉族工作人员和驻藏人民解放军，应满腔热情地、积极地以战斗的姿态投入这一伟大的革命运动。
    会议指出：由于贯彻执行了中央规定的“依靠劳动人民，团结一切可能团结的力量，消灭封建农奴制度”的阶级路线，充分发动群众，这就保证了民主改革第一阶段“三反双减”运动的顺利进行。在民主改革的第二阶段——土地改革运动中，必须坚定不移地贯彻执行这一阶级路线。
    会议对赎买政策和赎买的具体问题进行了认真的讨论。认为中央规定的对叛乱领主的土地、牲畜、农具、房屋等生产资料实行没收和对未叛乱领主的土地、牲畜、农具、房屋等生产资料实行赎买政策，是完全正确的。这样，既可能满足广大劳动农民的土地要求，又团结了一切可能团结的力量，最大限度地孤立反动的封建农奴主。
    会议对于作好牧业地区的工作问题，也进行了深入的研究。鉴于牧业地区的情况和农业地区有很大的不同，因此目前在牧业地区的任务主要是进行反叛乱、反乌拉、反奴役，实行牧工牧主两利政策，保护和发展牲畜，建立民主政权，以便达到发展牧业经济、改善牧民生活的目的。会议认为这一政策不但符合当前牧区情况，而且也符合党在牧业地区的长期工作方针。作好这一工作，与在农业地区作好分配土地的工作具有同等重要意义。
    会议还讨论了土地改革中的统战、工商业等各项政策和有关问题。
    会议考虑到土地改革后，农民已成为土地的主人，生产积极性势必大大提高。因此，在完成或正在进行土地分配的地区，对于明年的生产现在就要抓起来，使明年的生产来一个跃进，并初步确定了明年粮食作物的增产指标。会议要求作到改革、生产两不误，改革、生产双丰收。
    会议号召全体藏、汉族工作人员和驻藏解放军官兵，必须团结一致，艰苦奋斗，鼓足干劲，积极工作，充分发动群众，正确执行政策，在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，为完成民主改革的光荣任务而奋斗。
