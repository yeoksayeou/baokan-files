    Midnight Gong and Drum Sounds
    Not long ago, the night shift workers here launched a "night battle." The Liu Chunpu group in the steam drum workshop was the first to report victory to the "command headquarters," and they seized the first red flag. This news made the workers in the Zhang Yiming group, who had been far ahead, anxious. The two furnace cores they were processing could have been completed earlier, but the temperature of the electric roller of the air compressor suddenly rose. In order to take care of the machine, the workers waited for the machine to cool down before continuing to work, and they were the winners of the second red flag. In order to seize the third red flag as soon as possible, the workers in the Yang Zhongyong group, who were responsible for repairing the furnace openings, changed the original method of burning two furnace openings at a time to burning ten or twenty at a time. Sure enough, the new operation method saved time, and the task originally scheduled to be completed at one o'clock was completed ahead of schedule, and the quality was also very good...
      When the "night battle" was in full swing, who brought two buckets of tea? Everyone looked and saw that it was Party Secretary Liu. This secretary, who was respected by the workers, lost an arm and an eye in the war years. But he still went to the place where production was most intense. The workers were moved and took the tea from his hands.
    The gongs and drums are beating, beating; the indicators are rising, rising again. At one o'clock in the middle of the night, the workshop dispatcher announced that the "night battle" had completed 12,000 yuan worth of production in six hours, doubling the previous highest output value!

    深夜锣鼓声
    不久以前，我们这里的夜班工人们展开了一场“夜战”。汽包车间的刘春圃小组最先向“指挥部”报捷，第一面红旗被他们夺去了。这一消息使得本来遥遥领先的张义名小组的工人着急了，他们加工的两根炉心子原来早就能提前完工的，就怪空气压缩机的电滚子温度突然上升。为了爱惜机器，工人们还是等机器降温后再干，他们是第二面红旗的赢得者。为了趁早夺取第三面红旗，负责修炉口的杨忠勇小组的工人，把原来的一次烧二块炉口改作一次烧十块、烧二十块，果然新操作法赢得了时间，原订一点钟完成的任务，提前完成了，质量也非常好……
      “夜战”方酣时，是谁提了两桶茶水来？大家一看，原来是党委刘书记，这位工人们敬爱的书记在战争年代里失去了一只胳膊和一只眼睛。但他还是到生产最紧张的地方去。工人们感动地从他手里接过了茶水。
    锣鼓，敲着、敲着；指标，升高，再升高。到了午夜一点，车间调度员宣布，“夜战”六小时完成了产值一万二千元，比以往最高的产值还翻了一番！
