Combination of Oil Crops, Feed, and Fertilizer

Our joint state-private owned Jilin City Gongxin Oil Factory, in the past, due to insufficient raw materials, had to suspend production for three months or half a year annually. Since the Great Leap Forward in production in 1958, in order to fundamentally solve the problem of insufficient raw material supply, the factory's Party branch, according to the central government's guideline of "combination of oil crops, feed, and fertilizer," determined a production plan to vigorously develop comprehensive utilization of resources and carry out multi-variety operations. The enthusiasm of the workers was soaring. Workers who went out to find raw materials traveled throughout the neighboring three provinces and twenty-four cities and counties, and successively found fifteen kinds of oil crops such as mustard seed, radish seed, and grape seed, and thirteen kinds of raw materials for concurrent production such as peat and hawthorn seed.

After finding the raw materials, the factory mobilized the masses to engage in comprehensive utilization and trial-produce new products. "Dare to think, dare to do, spend less money on more experiments, experiment even without spending money, whoever can try what, just try it," was the basic requirement put forward by the factory's Party branch for mobilizing the masses to participate in the trial production of new products. Workers successively put forward more than ninety suggestions for comprehensive utilization and trial production of new products. Workers used hawthorn seeds, grape seed skins, peanut skins, vegetable seedlings, etc., which were discarded in the past, to make 1,600 tons of two kinds of mixed feed. Workers Chen Wenfu, Du Baichuan, and others used indigenous methods to extract seven kinds of chemical products such as furfural and activated carbon from sunflower seed hulls. The workers created the method of extracting furfural by "normal pressure dilute acid," opening up the way for comprehensive utilization of sunflower seeds. Worker Ma Qingshan used plant ash to produce three products: potassium sulfate, potassium carbonate, and potassium chloride. (Representative of Jilin Gongxin Oil Factory, Jing Quanming)

    油料、饲料、肥料三结合
    我们公私合营吉林市共信制油厂，过去因为原料不足，每年要有三个月或半年的停产时间。从1958年生产大跃进以来，为了从根本上解决原材料供应不足的问题，工厂党支部根据中央提出的“油料、饲料、肥料”三结合的方针，确定了大搞综合利用资源，开展多品种经营的生产规划。职工群众干劲冲天。出外找原料的职工走遍了邻近的三个省，二十四个市县，先后找到了芥菜籽、萝卜籽、葡萄籽等十五种油料，和草炭、山里红籽等十三种兼业生产用的原料。
    找到原料之后，工厂就发动群众搞综合利用，试制新产品。“大胆想、大胆干，少花钱多试验，不花钱也试验，谁能试啥就试啥”，是工厂党支部发动群众参加新产品试制提出的基本要求。工人们先后提出九十多项综合利用试制新产品的建议。工人们利用过去被扔掉的山里红籽、葡萄籽皮、花生皮、蔬菜秧等制成了两种混合饲料一千六百吨。工人陈文福、杜百川等用土办法从葵花皮中提炼出糠醛、活性炭等七种化学产品。工人们创造了“常压稀酸”提取糠醛的方法，打开了葵花籽综合利用的途径。工人马青山利用草木灰生产出硫酸钾、碳酸钾、氯化钾三种产品。　（吉林共信油厂代表景全明）
