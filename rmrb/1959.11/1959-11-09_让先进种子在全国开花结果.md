    Let Advanced Seeds Blossom and Bear Fruit Throughout the Country
    The National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in Industry, Transportation, Basic Construction, Finance, and Trade has concluded. More than six thousand advanced producers are about to return to their respective posts, carrying the advanced experiences widely exchanged over the past ten days, and bearing the ardent expectations of the Party, the government, and the people of the whole country. As we bid farewell to the heroic sons and daughters from all over the motherland with unparalleled excitement, we wish you new and greater victories in realizing the continued leap forward in the socialist construction of the motherland.
    Our era is a great era unprecedented in history. We have already accomplished great undertakings that our predecessors could not have dreamed of. However, compared to our far-reaching goals—to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science, and culture—the achievements already made are only a beginning. We still have arduous tasks ahead of us. At present, the most important thing is to complete this year's national economic plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it, and on this basis, to prepare for production in the first quarter of next year as early as possible, so as to prepare good conditions for the continued leap forward of the national economy in 1960.
    The mass movement led by our Party is the fundamental reason for the great achievements of our people and the source of strength for realizing our far-reaching goals. The current mass movement of the Great Leap Forward led by our Party is a revolutionary movement in which the Party unites activists to drive the broad masses of the people. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his article "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership": "In any place where there are masses, there are roughly three parts of people: the more active, the intermediate, and the more backward. Therefore, leaders must be good at uniting a small number of activists as the backbone of leadership, and rely on these backbones to raise the intermediate elements and win over the backward elements." Advanced producers are the active elements in the cause of socialist construction. The mass movement of socialist construction is to give play to the backbone role of advanced producers, raise the intermediate elements, win over the backward elements, and fully mobilize the broad masses of the people to accelerate the process of socialist construction. We hope that the nearly 300,000 advanced collectives and more than 3 million advanced producers across the country can better play this backbone role in the future. As the CPC Central Committee said in its congratulatory message to this conference, "Not only should you be free from arrogance and rashness, learn modestly, and strive to maintain the advanced title of your units and yourselves, but also carry forward the communist style of cooperation and help other units and people catch up to the advanced level." We hope that tens of millions of workers across the country can act more actively, learn the advanced ideas and advanced experiences of advanced producers, and quickly reach the advanced level. Only in this way can the production level of a small number of advanced producers be quickly transformed into the production level of the whole society, social production can be rapidly developed, and our country's socialist construction can continue to leap forward.
    The rapid transformation of the production level of a small number of advanced producers into the production level of the whole society is one of the most important signs of the superiority of the socialist system. In class society, the process of transforming the production level of a small number of advanced producers into the production level of the whole society is an extremely slow process. In such a society, "teaching apprentices starves the master," stifling countless talents, blocking the path of countless people seeking knowledge, and many people who have mastered advanced technologies pass away with "unique skills." In capitalist society, although production technology has developed faster than in feudal society, all advanced technologies are only adopted under the premise of benefiting the exploiting class, and are always regarded as "patents," trying every means to exclude others from using these advanced technologies. Only in socialist society does the process of transforming the production level of a small number of advanced producers into the production level of the whole society become a high-speed development process. This is because socialist society is a society without exploitation and without classes, the productive forces of society have been thoroughly liberated, the wisdom and talents of the people have been fully developed, all the people's initiatives are supported by the Party and the state, and all advanced technologies and advanced experiences are not the exclusive property of this unit or that unit, this person or that person, but the wealth of the whole people. These advanced technologies and advanced experiences are constantly improved in the process of mass mutual learning, mutual supplementation, and mutual development, and become the crystallization of collective wisdom. This is the fundamental reason why socialism can create much higher labor productivity than capitalism, and therefore will surely defeat capitalism.
    The mass movement of the Great Leap Forward is a movement to fully utilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the people and transform the production level of a small number of advanced producers into the production level of the whole society at high speed. The socialist labor competition of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward" reflects not only the heroic spirit of the broad masses of workers to go all out and strive for the upstream, but also the noble style of thousands of advanced producers who enthusiastically help others. The combination of these two forces makes the process of transforming the production level of a small number of advanced producers into the production level of the whole society a conscious process of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, often in just a few months, or even less time, advanced technology is popularized, advanced quotas become general quotas, and social production develops at high speed. For example, in the first quarter of this year, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces across the country was only 0.569 tons, and only a few advanced units reached more than 0.7 tons. Now, the advanced level of a few months ago has become the national level. In August, the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces across the country reached 0.71 tons, and in September it further increased to 0.852 tons. And the advanced collective attending this conference, the Red Flag No. 2 small blast furnace of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, increased the utilization coefficient to 3.201 tons in October. We believe that after this "gathering of heroes," the labor competition of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward" will surely be carried out more extensively and deeply, the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy will surely develop more extensively, deeply, and healthily, and the advanced production level will surely be transformed into the production level of the whole society more quickly. What aspects should we learn from the advanced? In general, there are only two aspects: one is to learn their advanced ideas, and the other is to learn their advanced technologies. What aspects should we help the backward from? In general, there are also only two aspects: one is to help them ideologically, and the other is to help them technologically. That is to say, in order to extensively and deeply carry out the labor competition of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward," and to continuously carry out the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy, we must adhere to putting politics in command and continue to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution on a large scale. Putting politics in command means strengthening the leadership of the Party and implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction and a set of "walking on two legs" policies for all work; for each individual, it means raising communist consciousness and implementing the spirit of the Party's general line for socialist construction into one's work and life. That is to say, everyone must go all out, constantly strive for the upstream, carry forward the collective spirit of being selfless, putting others before oneself, and helping others, carry forward the master-like labor attitude of not counting rewards, maintain the innovative spirit of daring to think and daring to do, and maintain excellent qualities such as diligently studying, being modest and simple, and maintaining close ties with the masses. These are the decisive factors for advanced producers to reach advanced levels. Many old models attending this conference, who are known as "red flags that never fade," such as Meng Tai, Yi Shijuan, the Mao Zedong locomotive crew, the Ma Hengchang team, and the Liu Jiuxue coal mining team, are examples in this regard. While constantly raising communist consciousness, we must also modestly learn technology and stubbornly study technology, and find innovative ways in technology in order to break through the old production level and achieve new achievements. Huang Rongchang, Wang Fengen, Wei Gaohou, and many other advanced producers attending this conference are examples in this regard.
    In order to make the labor competition more extensive and in-depth, and to make the upsurge of the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy develop more persistently, from the leadership's point of view, it is also necessary to seriously strengthen enterprise management. In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, there have been many successful experiences in this regard. Due to the implementation of the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee and the promotion of experiences such as "two participations, one change, and three combinations," enterprise management has made great progress. Since the beginning of this year, nearly 300,000 advanced collectives have emerged, including not only advanced groups and advanced workshops, but also advanced enterprises. This shows that our enterprise management has indeed made great improvements. Groups of dozens of people, workshops of hundreds of people, and enterprises of thousands of people can be well organized to cooperate and reach advanced levels. However, there are indeed many enterprises that still lack a set of socialist enterprise management methods that are adapted to the mass movement. The improvement of the production level of an enterprise is inseparable from the level of management of the same enterprise. There are often such situations: the labor competition is doing well, and the production level has also improved, but it cannot be consolidated, and it goes up and down. There are many reasons for this, but the most important one is often that enterprise management cannot keep up, and the various links of production are not well organized, which affects the development of production. Therefore, advanced collectives and advanced producers must also help the leadership strengthen enterprise management and summarize a set of advanced experiences in enterprise management in the movement to increase production and practice economy.
    The more than six thousand representatives attending the conference of heroes are about to return to their production posts. The Party, the state, and the people of the whole country expect you to further and better play the leading role, backbone role, and bridge role of advanced producers in production, work, study, life, and all aspects of enterprise activities, unite all employees, spread advanced seeds throughout the country, and let these advanced seeds blossom and bear fruit under the sunshine of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and promote our country's socialist construction at high speed!

    让先进种子在全国开花结果
    全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会闭幕了。六千多名先进生产者们，即将带着十几天来广泛交流的先进经验，带着党、政府和全国人民的殷切期望，奔返各自岗位的时候，我们以无比兴奋的热情送别来自祖国四方的英雄儿女，祝你们在实现祖国社会主义建设事业的继续跃进中取得新的更大的胜利。
    我们的时代是历史上从来不曾有过的伟大时代。我们已经做了我们的先人梦想不到的伟大事业。然而，比起我们远大的目标——把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家来说，已经获得的成就只不过是开始。在我们面前还摆着艰巨的工作。而在当前，最重要的是，要提前超额完成今年的国民经济计划，并且在这个基础上，及早做好明年第一季度的生产准备工作，为1960年国民经济的继续跃进准备良好条件。
    我们党所领导的群众运动，是我国人民获得伟大成就的根本原因，也是实现我们的远大目标的力量源泉。目前我们党所领导的大跃进的群众运动，是党团结积极分子带动广大人民群众的革命运动。毛泽东同志在“关于领导方法的若干问题”一文中指出：“任何有群众的地方，大致都有比较积极的、中间状态的和比较落后的三部分人。故领导者必须善于团结少数积极分子作为领导的骨干，并凭借这些骨干去提高中间分子，争取落后分子。”先进生产者就是社会主义建设事业中的积极分子。社会主义建设的群众运动，就是发挥先进生产者的骨干作用，提高中间分子，争取落后分子，把广大人民群众充分动员起来，加速社会主义建设的进程。我们希望全国近三十万个先进集体和三百多万个先进生产者，在今后都能更好地发挥这种骨干作用，像中共中央在这次大会的祝词中所说的那样，“不仅要不骄不躁，虚心学习，努力使自己的单位和自己保持先进的称号，而且要发扬共产主义的协作风格，帮助别的单位和别人赶上先进的水平。”我们希望全国几千万职工都能更积极地行动起来，学习先进生产者的先进思想和先进经验，迅速达到先进的水平。只有这样，少数先进生产者的生产水平才能迅速地变成全社会的生产水平，社会生产才能迅速地发展，我国社会主义建设事业才能继续跃进。
    少数先进生产者的生产水平迅速变成全社会的生产水平，这是社会主义制度优越性的最重要的标志之一。在阶级社会里，少数先进生产者的生产水平变成全社会的生产水平的过程，是一个极其缓慢的过程。在那样的社会里，“教会徒弟，饿死师傅”，不知扼杀了多少天才，不知堵塞了多少人求知的道路，也不知有多少掌握了先进技术的人怀着“绝技”与世长辞。在资本主义社会，生产技术虽然有了比封建社会较快的发展，但是一切先进的技术，也只是在有利于剥削阶级的前提下才被采纳，并且总是被当作“专利”，千方百计地排斥别人利用这种先进的技术。只有在社会主义社会，少数先进生产者的生产水平变成全社会的生产水平的过程，才成为一个高速度发展的过程。这是因为社会主义社会是没有剥削、没有阶级的社会，社会生产力得到了彻底解放，人民群众的聪明才智得到了最充分的发挥，人民群众的一切创举都得到党和国家的支持，所有先进技术和先进经验都不是这个单位或那个单位、这个人或那个人的专有，而是全民的财富。这些先进技术和先进经验在群众性的互相学习、互相补充、互相发展的过程中日益完善，成为集体智慧的结晶。这就是为什么社会主义能够创造比资本主义高得多的劳动生产率，因而一定能够战胜资本主义的根本原因。
    大跃进的群众运动，就是充分发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性，高速度地把少数先进生产者的生产水平变成全社会的生产水平的运动。“比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进”的社会主义劳动竞赛，一方面反映了广大职工鼓足干劲、力争上游的英雄气概，另一方面也反映了千千万万先进生产者满腔热情地帮助别人的高尚风格。这两种力量的结合，使少数先进生产者的生产水平变成全社会的生产水平的过程，成为一个广大人民群众的自觉的过程。因而，常常只是几个月的时间，甚至更短的时间，先进的技术就普及了，先进的定额就变成了一般的定额，社会生产高速度地发展了。例如，在今年第一季度，全国小高炉的平均利用系数还只有零点五六九吨，达到零点七吨以上的还只是少数先进单位。现在，几个月以前的先进水平已经变成全国的水平了。8月份全国小高炉的利用系数就达到零点七一吨，9月份更提高到零点八五二吨。而出席这次大会的先进集体——马鞍山钢铁公司红旗二号小高炉在10月份又把利用系数提高到三点二零一吨了。我们相信，这次“群英会”后，“比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进”的劳动竞赛一定会更广泛、更深入地开展起来，增产节约的群众运动一定会更广泛、更深入、更健康地发展下去，先进的生产水平一定能更快地变成全社会的生产水平。学先进，从哪些方面学呢？总起来说，无非是两个方面：一是学习他们的先进思想，一是学习他们的先进技术。帮后进，从哪些方面帮呢？总起来说，也无非是两个方面：一是从思想上帮助，一是从技术上帮助。这就是说，为了广泛深入地开展“比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进”的劳动竞赛，使增产节约群众运动持续开展下去，必须坚持政治挂帅，继续大搞技术革新和技术革命。政治挂帅，就各项工作来说，就是要加强党的领导，贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针；就每一个人来说，就是要提高共产主义觉悟，把党的社会主义建设总路线的精神贯彻到自己的工作和生活中去。这也就是说，每一个人都要鼓足干劲，不断力争上游，发扬大公无私、先人后己和舍己助人的集体主义精神，发扬不计报酬的主人翁的劳动态度，保持敢想敢做的革新精神，保持努力学习、谦虚朴素、联系群众等等优良品质。这些都是先进生产者能够攀上先进水平的决定性因素。出席这次大会的许多被誉为“永不褪色的红旗”的老模范，如孟泰、裔式娟、毛泽东号机车包乘组、马恒昌小组、刘九学采煤队等，都是这方面的榜样。在不断提高共产主义觉悟的同时，还要虚心地学习技术，顽强地钻研技术，在技术上找到革新的办法，才能突破旧的生产水平，取得新的成就。出席这次大会的黄荣昌、王凤恩、魏高厚和其他许许多多先进生产者，都是这方面的榜样。
    为了使劳动竞赛更广泛、更深入地开展起来，使增产节约群众运动的高潮更持久地发展下去，从领导方面来说，还必须认真加强企业管理工作。几年来，特别是大跃进以来，这方面已有许多成功的经验。由于实行党委领导下的厂长负责制，推行“两参一改三结合”等经验，企业的管理工作有了很大的进步。今年以来就出现了近三十万个先进集体，其中不仅有先进的小组、先进的车间，而且有先进的企业。这表明我们的企业管理工作确实有了很大的提高。几十人的小组，几百人的车间，成千上万人的企业都能很好地组织起来，协同动作，登上先进的水平。但是也确实有不少企业还缺乏一套同群众运动相适应的社会主义企业的管理方法。一个企业生产水平的提高，是同一个企业管理的水平分不开的。常常有这样的情况，劳动竞赛搞得很好，生产水平也提高了，但是不能巩固，忽上忽下。这里原因固然很多，但是最重要的，常常是因为企业管理工作跟不上，生产的各个环节组织得还不够好，使生产的发展受到影响。所以先进集体和先进生产者在增产节约运动中还必须帮助领导上加强企业管理、总结出一套企业管理的先进经验。
    参加群英会的六千多名代表就要回到自己的生产岗位了。党、国家和全国人民期望你们在生产中、工作中、学习中、生活中，在企业的各方面的活动中，进一步更好地发挥先进生产者的带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用，团结全体职工群众，把先进的种子播遍全国，让这些先进种子在党的社会主义建设总路线的阳光照耀下开花结果，高速度地推进我国的社会主义建设事业！
