Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 19th: TASS, Moscow, 18th, is authorized to publish a statement regarding a series of recent talks by the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Adenauer, on the West Berlin issue.

The statement points out that in his talks, Adenauer attempted to portray the matter as if the West Berlin issue—the question of maintaining the rights of the three Western countries occupying the city—was one of “defending” West Berlin’s freedom from any infringement.

The statement says that Chancellor Adenauer's distorted remarks concerned the essence of the Berlin issue. Everything has been turned upside down.

The statement points out that when Mr. Adenauer acts in this way, one of his goals is clearly to re-aggravate the relations between countries that have recently begun to improve, and to hinder the peoples of all countries from escaping the "Cold War."

The statement says that the main thing now is to eliminate the remnants of war in relations between countries and to completely end the past war in Europe. It is obvious that this can only be achieved by concluding a German peace treaty. The Soviet government advocates the conclusion of a peace treaty to resolve the Berlin issue, so as to clear the clouds in the sky and establish a truly peaceful situation in this part of Europe.

Even if the practical solution to the German peace treaty issue has not yet been reached today, Prime Minister Adenauer should understand that meetings and talks between national leaders are now being held one after another, and this issue will be fundamentally discussed at the summit conference of the heads of government.

The Soviet leaders expressed their belief that the heads of government will correctly and wisely resolve the issue of peace with Germany. In this way, it will enable the countries that participated in the war against Hitler's Germany to sign a peace treaty and will finally establish normal international relations in Central Europe in peacetime. In this way, the hotbed of tension in West Berlin, which breeds various unexpected events and may lead to adverse consequences, can be eliminated. This hotbed must be eliminated to help establish conditions for peaceful coexistence among countries and to strengthen world peace.

    必须消除西柏林紧张策源地
    塔斯社发表声明驳斥阿登纳在西柏林问题上的歪曲言论
    新华社莫斯科19日电　据塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：塔斯社受权就德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳最近关于西柏林问题的一系列谈话发表声明。
    声明中指出，阿登纳在他的谈话中企图把事情描绘成这样，好像西柏林问题——这是保持占领该城的三个西方国家的权利问题，好像是“保卫”西柏林的自由免受任何侵犯的问题。
    声明中说，阿登纳总理的歪曲谈话了柏林问题的实质。所有事情都被颠倒了。
    声明中指出，当阿登纳先生这样作的时候，他所追求的一个目的显然是：要重新使最近已经开始好转的国与国之间的关系恶化，并阻挠各国人民摆脱“冷战”。
    声明中说，现在主要的是，在各国之间的关系中，消灭战争的残余，在欧洲彻底结束过去的战争，而要做到这一点，很显然，只有缔结对德和约，才能办到。苏联政府主张缔结和约，从而解决柏林问题，以便扫清天空上的乌云，在欧洲的这一部分建立真正平静的局面。
    即使今天还没有达到实际解决对德和约问题的地步，阿登纳总理也应该明白，现在正陆续举行国家领导人的会晤和会谈，这一问题将在政府首脑会议上进行根本的讨论。
    苏联领导人表示相信，政府首脑将正确明智地解决对德媾和问题。这样，就将使参加对希特勒德国作战的国家有可能签订和约，并将终于在中欧建立起和平时期正常的国际关系。这样就可以消灭西柏林的紧张策源地，这种策源地孕育着种种意外事件，可能导致不良后果。必须消除这种策源地，帮助建立各国和平共处和加强世界和平的条件。
