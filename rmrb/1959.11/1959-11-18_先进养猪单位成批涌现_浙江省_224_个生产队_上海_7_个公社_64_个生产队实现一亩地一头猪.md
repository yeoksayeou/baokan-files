    Advanced Pig Raising Units Emerge in Large Numbers
    224 Production Teams in Zhejiang Province, 64 Production Teams in 7 Communes in Shanghai Achieve One Pig Per Mu
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Zhejiang province already has two hundred and twenty-four production teams which have realized the leap forward target of one pig per mu of cultivated land.
    This group of advanced units in Zhejiang Province that have developed pig production at high speed emerged after resolutely implementing the provincial party committee's production policy of "taking grain as the key link, combining grain and livestock, comprehensive development, and comprehensive balance." First of all, raising more pigs provided a large amount of high-quality fertilizer for agriculture, and the grain output of these production teams has greatly increased this year. The twenty-two production teams in Jinyun County with an average of more than one pig per mu of cultivated land are all located in mountainous areas with barren land and a lack of fertilizer, and their grain output was originally not high; however, after applying a large amount of pig manure, these production teams have seen rice fields with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu this year. Secondly, the income of the communes has greatly increased. For example, the Lianqun production team of the Tou Shi Tuo commune in Huangyan County raises many pigs, and this year its public accumulation can increase by more than 17,000 yuan, and the income of the members has also increased significantly.
    The reason why this group of advanced pig-raising units can develop pig production at high speed is first and foremost that the Party committee attaches importance to it, strengthens leadership, and ensures that politics takes command. These production teams have generally established livestock leadership organizations, with dedicated personnel in charge, and at the same time publicize the benefits of pig raising among the members, educating them through examples, accounting comparisons, and making them realize the benefits of more pigs, more fertilizer, more grain, more income, and supporting national construction. Therefore, many production teams with a poor foundation in pig raising also tried every means to overcome various difficulties and vigorously raise pigs. The Jinxing production team of the Choucheng commune in Yiwu County was originally a poor mountain gully with poor soil and a lack of fertilizer, and was a unit with poor production conditions in the local area. However, the cadres and members of this team were determined to change their backwardness, not afraid of any difficulties, and developed animal husbandry at high speed. At the beginning, there was a lack of funds, so the members chopped firewood and sold it for money, investing more than 1,000 yuan; if there were not enough pigsties, they built them themselves; without management experience, they sent people to Hangzhou, Huangyan and other places to learn from them. At present, this production team has rapidly developed to an average of 1.8 pigs per mu of cultivated land, and there are also a large number of cattle and sheep.
    Resolutely implement the policy of public raising as the main factor while developing household raising by members, and cultivate a large number of breeding pigs to achieve self-breeding and self-raising. At present, these production teams generally have one to several livestock farms, and outstanding members have been transferred to serve as breeders. The livestock farm of the Lianqun production team in Huangyan County has emerged with "ten female pig-raising experts." They put forward the slogan "work in front of the pens, live in front of the pens, be red in the livestock farm, and be specialized in the livestock farm," and launched competitions with each other, which drove the work enthusiasm of other breeders.
    A responsibility system has been established for solving feed and doing a good job in epidemic prevention. These production teams have generally established perennial feed bases, cultivated a large number of high-yield feeds, mainly green and coarse feeds, and appropriately matched fine feeds to achieve coarse feed finely fed, green feed fermented, and multiple feeds mixed. Production teams in the plain water network area make full use of the lake and pond water surface to cultivate feed; production teams in the mountainous and semi-mountainous areas carry out intercropping in forests and collect a large amount of wild grass and vegetables. In order to strengthen epidemic prevention work, they vigorously carried out pen cleaning, disinfection and preventive injections, so pig epidemics rarely occur.
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Among the one hundred and sixty-nine people's communes in the eleven counties of Shanghai, seven communes and sixty-four production teams (not including the production teams of the seven communes) have an average of more than one pig per mu of cultivated land. The seven communes are: Huacao, Jiwang, and Xinjing in Shanghai County; Pengpu, Jiangwan, and Wujiaochang in Baoshan County; and Zhuqiao in Nanhui County. The six communes in Shanghai County and Baoshan County are basically suburban vegetable areas; Zhuqiao Commune in Nanhui County is a remote suburban cotton and grain area.
    Conscientiously implementing the policy of giving priority to public ownership and combining public and private ownership is the main reason for the high-speed development of pig raising. During the cooperative period, collective pig raising in these communes had developed considerably, but the speed was slow due to limitations in funds and manpower. After the establishment of the people's communes, funds and manpower became strong, and the communes used this favorable condition to run collective pig raising undertakings on a large scale. In less than a year, they had established breeding farms for the communes, pig farms for each team, and established feed processing factories and agricultural and sideline product processing factories to solve the problems of pig breeds and feed processing. In addition to the two feed processing factories run by the Xinjing Commune, seven of the twelve production teams have been equipped with a feed cutting machine. The commune helped the production team train a large number of veterinarians and epidemic prevention personnel, so that large farms had veterinary rooms and small farms had veterinary groups. Some communes combined two members (breeders and epidemic prevention workers) to carry out injections regularly, basically eliminating diseases such as swine fever, swine erysipelas, swine plague, typhoid fever, and bacillary dysentery. The commune strengthened its leadership over animal husbandry. From the commune to the production team to the small team, a deputy director or deputy team leader was assigned to take charge of animal husbandry production.
    After the large-scale development of collective pig raising, the amount of commodities increased rapidly. From January to September of this year, the seven communes of Zhuqiao, Jiwang, etc. sold a total of more than 48,500 market hogs to the state, an increase of about 50% over the same period last year. Among them, the Xinjing Commune sold a total of 6,860 market hogs in ten months this year and supported urban agencies and fraternal communes with 5,005 piglets, while only 2,368 market hogs and piglets were on the market in the same period last year.
    The large-scale development of collective pig raising has enhanced the economic strength of the communes and is conducive to expanding reproduction. By the end of September, the total income from animal husbandry in the Xinjing Commune reached 459,000 yuan, an average of 131 yuan per household. The Tanqiao Production Team of the Pengpu Commune had an income of more than 206,000 yuan from agricultural and sideline industries in ten months this year, of which pig raising accounted for 45%.
    While adhering to collective breeding as the main factor, the above seven communes also actively encouraged private breeding by members. They left feed land for the members and gave preferential treatment in terms of piglets, etc. Many production teams also bought the members' pig manure with cash. These measures greatly increased the members' enthusiasm for raising pigs.
    More pigs and sufficient fertilizer promoted the overall increase in production of crops such as grain, cotton, vegetables, and rapeseed. Pig manure is not only highly fertile, but also has the effect of loosening the soil and improving the soil. Since 1958, the Xinjing Xiaodui (small team) of the Xinjing Production Team of the Xinjing Commune has used pig manure as base fertilizer and top dressing, and appropriately used some human manure. This has changed the phenomenon of soil hardening and vegetable wilting that occurred in the past when human manure was used alone.
    Judging from the seven communes such as Xinjing, there is still great potential for vigorously raising pigs. At present, the development of pig raising in these seven communes is still uneven. For example, three of the seven production teams in the Pengpu Commune have not yet reached one pig per mu, while the highest Tanqiao Production Team has reached 15 pigs per mu. Now these seven communes are further setting off a high tide of pig raising.

    先进养猪单位成批涌现
    浙江省224个生产队  上海7个公社64个生产队实现一亩地一头猪
    本报讯　浙江全省已经有二百二十四个生产队实现了一亩耕地一头猪的跃进指标。
    浙江省这批高速度发展养猪生产的先进单位，是在坚决贯彻执行省委提出的“以粮为纲、粮畜并举，全面发展、综合平衡”的生产方针后涌现出来的。首先，多养猪为农业提供了大量优质肥料，这些生产队今年粮食产量都大大增加。缙云县平均每亩耕地养猪一头以上的二十二个生产队，都处在土地贫瘠、肥料缺乏的山区，原来粮食产量不高；但大量施用猪肥后，今年这些生产队都出现了亩产千斤的稻田；其次，公社收入大大增加。如黄岩县头是陀公社联群生产队养猪多，今年公共积累可增加一万七千多元，社员收入也显著增加。
    这批养猪先进单位所以能高速度发展养猪生产，首先是党委重视，加强领导，做到政治挂帅。这些生产队一般都建立了畜牧业领导机构，有专人负责，同时在社员中宣传养猪的好处，通过实例教育，算账对比，使社员认识到猪多、肥多、粮食多、收入多和支援国家建设的好处，因而许多原来养猪基础较差的生产队也千方百计克服各种困难，大力养猪。义乌县稠城公社金星生产队，原来是个土质差、肥料缺的穷山沟，在当地是生产条件较差的单位，但是这个队的干部和社员决心改变落后面貌，不怕任何困难，高速度发展畜牧业。开始时资金缺乏，社员们就砍柴卖钱，投资一千多元；畜圈不够，自己动手修建；没有管理经验，派人远道赶到杭州、黄岩等地学习。目前这个生产队迅速发展到平均每亩耕地有猪一点八头，还有大批牛、羊。
    坚决执行公养为主同时发展社员家庭饲养的方针，大量培养种猪，做到自繁自养。现在这批生产队一般都有了一个到几个畜牧场，抽调了优秀社员担任饲养员。黄岩县联群生产队畜牧场出现了“十女养猪能手”，她们提出了“工作在栏前、生活在栏前、红在畜牧场、专在畜牧场”的口号，并相互展开竞赛，带动了其他饲养员的工作积极性。
    在解决饲料、作好防疫等工作上建立了责任制。这些生产队一般都建立了常年饲料基地，大量种植高产饲料，以青粗饲料为主，适当搭配精饲料，做到粗料细喂，青料发酵喂，多料混喂。在平原水网地带的生产队，充分利用湖荡水面，养植饲料；山区半山区的生产队，大搞林间套种，大量采集野草野菜。为加强防疫工作，大力开展了清栏消毒和预防注射等工作，因而猪疫病很少发生。
    本报讯　上海市郊十一个县的一百六十九个人民公社中，已有七个公社和六十四个生产队（不包括七个公社的生产队）平均每亩耕地养猪一头以上。这七个公社是：上海县的华漕、纪王、新泾，宝山县的彭浦、江湾、五角场，南汇县的祝桥。上海县和宝山县的六个公社，基本上都是近郊蔬菜区；南汇县的祝桥公社是远郊棉粮区。
    认真贯彻公养为主公私并举的方针，是高速度发展养猪的主要原因。合作化时期，这几个公社集体养猪已有了相当发展，但因资金、人力限制，速度较慢。建立人民公社后，资金、人力雄厚了，公社运用这个有利条件大办集体养猪事业。不到一年，做到了社有种畜场，队队有养猪场，兴办了饲料加工厂、农副产品加工厂，解决了猪种和饲料加工问题。新泾公社除了公社办有二个饲料加工厂外，十二个生产队中已有七个生产队配备了一台饲料切割机。公社帮助生产队训练了大批兽医、防疫人员，做到了大场有兽医室，小场有兽医组。有的社是二员（饲养员、防疫员）结合，定期进行注射，基本上消灭了猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫、副伤寒、白痢病等病害。公社加强了对畜牧业的领导，从公社到生产队到小队，都配有一个副主任、副队长专管畜牧业生产。
    集体养猪大发展后，商品量迅速增加。今年1至9月，祝桥、纪王等七个公社共卖给国家肉猪四万八千五百多头，比去年同期增加50％左右。其中新泾公社今年十个月共出售肉猪六千八百六十头，支援城市机关和兄弟公社的猪苗有五千零五头，而去年同期上市的肉猪和猪苗仅二千三百六十八头。
    集体养猪的大发展，增强了公社的经济力量，有利于扩大再生产。新泾公社到9月底畜牧业总收入达四十五万九千元，平均每户一百三十一元。彭浦公社谈桥生产队今年十个月农副业收入二十万六千多元，其中养猪收入占45％。
    在坚持集体饲养为主的同时，上述七个公社也积极鼓励社员私养。给社员留了饲料地，在苗猪等方面给予照顾，许多生产队并以现金收买社员的猪粪尿。这些措施大大提高了社员养猪的积极性。
    猪多肥足，促进了粮食、棉花、蔬菜、油菜等农作物全面增产。猪粪不仅肥效高，而且有松土改良土壤的作用。新泾公社新泾生产队中新泾小队自1958年起，用猪粪作基肥、追肥，并适当用一部分人粪尿后，改变了过去单纯使用人粪尿时土地板结、蔬菜萎缩不长的现象。
    从新泾等七个公社来看，大力养猪的潜力还很大。目前这七个公社的养猪事业发展还不平衡，如彭浦公社七个生产队中有三个还没有达到一亩地一头猪，而最高的谈桥生产队已达到一亩地十五头猪。现在这七个公社正在进一步掀起养猪高潮。
