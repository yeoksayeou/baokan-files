Attempting to Ease Contradictions Difficult to Ease
Frequent Diplomatic Activities of Western European Leaders

(Reported by this newspaper) On the eve of the Western summit, activities among Western European countries are becoming increasingly frequent. On November 11, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd arrived in Paris for talks with France; in mid-November, West German Chancellor Adenauer will visit London and Paris. In December, Italian Prime Minister Segni will visit Britain. Not long ago, the Greek Prime Minister visited Italy. Next April, French President De Gaulle will also make his first visit to London since taking office.

Difficult to Coordinate Anglo-French Relations

Before and after Lloyd's visit to France, British and French newspapers emphasized that since France formed an axis with West Germany and established the "Common Market" excluding Britain, while Britain also formed the "Little Free Trade Area" of seven countries and took the initiative in East-West relations, Anglo-French relations had become "extremely bad" (French "Le Figaro"). The British "Manchester Guardian" even said that "it is rare for Anglo-French relations to be so bad since the war."

Before visiting France, Lloyd said in a foreign policy debate in the British House of Commons: "A frank negotiation in Paris or London soon will provide a new beginning for Britain's attitude towards Europe."

The Anglo-French talks ended on the 12th, and no communiqué was issued afterwards. From the statements of both spokespersons and Western press reports, it can be seen that although officials repeatedly emphasized that the two sides "no longer have differences" and "restored trust," in reality, opinions were not entirely consistent. On some issues, especially on the timing of the East-West summit, Britain made concessions to France's views, but a London dispatch from United Press International said that Macmillan would continue to urge a summit "as soon as possible." As for the issues of the "Common Market" and the "Little Free Trade Area," which are the root causes of the Anglo-French conflict, and the French proposal to participate in the Western "leadership core," this meeting did not achieve any "concrete results." The British "Financial Times" summarized that, given the "terrible extent" of suspicion and distrust between Britain and France, the Foreign Secretary could not hope his actions could go beyond "patching up."

Adenauer Plays Both Sides

Adenauer's upcoming visit to Britain is an important event in current British-West German relations. Originally, this visit was to take place last year. However, at that time, due to the extreme deterioration of Anglo-German relations, Adenauer deliberately delayed the visit. Now, observers in Bonn point out that the purpose of Adenauer's visit to Britain is to try to "ease" the long-standing sharp contradictions between West Germany and Britain. It is known that Britain and West Germany have had fierce conflicts over the issues of the "Common Market" and Britain's "Free Trade Area," the convening of an East-West summit, and the establishment of a military sparse zone in Europe. Not long ago, Britain organized the "Little Free Trade Area" to counter the West European "Common Market," which greatly impacted West Germany's market in Europe. Originally, Adenauer had always wanted to benefit from both the British "Free Trade Area" and the "Common Market." In this situation, Adenauer stated in a recent speech that he was "prepared to meet Britain's wishes on the free trade area issue," but he also emphasized that this should not harm the "close cooperation" of the "six countries" in the political sphere. The British "Scotsman" said this was Adenauer's "eagerness to improve relations with Britain" because "Britain and Germany (West Germany) have common interests" in building a bridge between the "Common Market" and the "Little Free Trade Area."

On the other hand, on the issue of the East-West summit, West Germany and France "stand together, and the differences with London are very sharp" (West German "Parliamentary Political News"). When De Gaulle issued a statement on November 10 stating that he wanted to postpone the East-West summit, West German officials immediately stated that De Gaulle, "like Adenauer, also intends not to attend the meeting so urgently." Now, Western news agencies are reporting that the Franco-West German axis is trying its best to resist Britain's initiative on this issue. American newspapers, in analyzing this contradiction, said that Adenauer and De Gaulle's alliance aims to exclude Britain and become a "third force in the world" ("New York Times") and to "challenge the United States' leadership in the Western alliance" ("New York Herald Tribune").

Cracks Appear in the "Bonn-Paris Axis"

In recent times, the West German and French "Bonn-Paris axis" has not been smooth sailing either. Within the "Common Market," the contradictions between West Germany and France are growing. And recently, more and more remarks dissatisfied with France have appeared in West German newspapers. As early as mid-August, when French Prime Minister Debré argued in a speech that France "must have the power to make others listen to and understand its opinions," the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung," which often reflects the government's attitude, said that De Gaulle demanded that France enjoy the status of a world power, but it "has neither the strength nor the means." "We Germans can only feel uncomfortable about this." When the French government announced its invitation to Khrushchev to visit France, Bonn politicians believed that this was "one of the heaviest blows to Adenauer's foreign policy." And recently, according to Western news agencies, what particularly dissatisfied Adenauer was that "France attempted to restrict West Germany from participating in the Western summit to be held in Paris on December 19, and there is a trend to establish a US-British-French 'three-person steering committee'." Adenauer even wrote to De Gaulle to lodge a "protest" for this. The West German "Die Welt" also warned: "We hope that De Gaulle's policy will not force us to make a choice between the United States and France. If we must do so, we can only bid farewell to France." However, the French "French Observer" weekly believes that Adenauer's desire for his country to play the role of a great power at least equal to France has already caused "cracks" in the "Bonn-Paris axis."

Small Countries and Big Countries Compete for Power

According to sources, the contradictions among Western European countries are not limited to West Germany, Britain, and France. The American "New York Times" said a few days ago that the reduced dependence of Western European countries on the United States has complicated relations between countries in the Western bloc. "Many countries and governments are already a little tired of not being taken seriously and being treated like errand boys." The newspaper specifically mentioned Italy. According to United Press International, Italy is currently demanding a greater say in Western policy decisions. And Prime Minister Segni's visit to Britain in December is also to "conduct a series of talks before Italy participates in the Western summit." At the same time, the British "News Chronicle" also said: A crisis is brewing within the Atlantic alliance because the small countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization believe that "the three major powers are not allowing them to participate in the rapidly evolving diplomatic situation."

### 企图缓和难以缓和的矛盾  西欧国家首脑外交活动频繁

    企图缓和难以缓和的矛盾
    西欧国家首脑外交活动频繁
    本报讯　在西方举行最高级会议的前夕，西欧国家之间的活动日益频繁。11月11日英国外交大臣劳埃德已到达巴黎，同法国进行会谈；11月中旬，西德总理阿登纳将去伦敦和巴黎访问。12月，意大利总理塞尼将访问英国。不久前，希腊首相访问了意大利。明年4月，法国总统戴高乐也将作他上台后第一次的伦敦访问。
    英法关系难协调
    在劳埃德访法前后，英国和法国的报纸都强调指出，自从法国同西德结成轴心，并成立排斥英国的“共同市场”，而英国也筹组七国“小自由贸易区”，并在东西方关系上采取主动以来，英法关系“坏到极点”（法国“费加罗报”）。英国“曼彻斯特卫报”甚至说“战后英法关系糟到如此地步是少见的”。
    劳埃德在访法之前曾在英国下院外交辩论中说过：不久在巴黎或伦敦的坦率的谈判中“英国对欧洲的态度将有一个新的开端。”
    英法会谈已在12日结束，会后没有发表任何公报。从双方发言人的谈话和西方报刊的报道可以看出，尽管官方人士一再强调双方“已经没有分歧”、“恢复了信任”，但是实际上意见并未完全一致。在某些问题上，特别是在举行东西方最高级会议的时间问题上，英国向法国的观点作了让步，但是合众国际社的一则伦敦消息说：麦克米伦将继续力促“尽快”举行最高级会议。至于在造成英法冲突的根源的“共同市场”和“小自由贸易区”的问题，以及法国参加西方“领导核心”的建议上，这次会谈并没有取得什么“具体的结果”。英国“金融时报”总括说，鉴于英法之间猜疑和不信任的“可怕程度”，外交大臣不能希望他的作为能够超出“修修补补的程度”。
    阿登纳左右开弓
    不久之后阿登纳到英国的访问，是目前英国西德关系中的一个重要事件。本来这次访问早在去年就要进行的。但是当时由于英德关系极度恶化，阿登纳故意拖延了这次访问。现在据波恩观察家指出，阿登纳这次访问英国的目的是试图“缓和”西德和英国间长期存在的尖锐矛盾。人们知道，在“共同市场”和英国的“自由贸易区”问题、召开东西方最高级会议以及在欧洲建立军事稀疏区问题上，英国和西德一直存在着激烈的冲突。不久前英国组织起对抗西欧“共同市场”的“小自由贸易区”，使西德在欧洲的市场受到很大的打击。本来阿登纳一直是想在英国的“自由贸易区”和“共同市场”上两面取利的。在这种情况下，阿登纳在不久前的一篇演说中表示他“准备满足英国在自由贸易区问题上的愿望”，但是他又强调这不能损害“六国”在政治方面的“密切合作”。英国“苏格兰人报”说这是阿登纳“急于要改善同英国的关系”。因为在搭起“共同市场”和“小自由贸易区”的桥梁方面，“英国和德国（西德）是有共同利益的”。
    另一方面，在东西方最高级会议问题上，西德和法国“站在一起同伦敦之间的分歧十分尖锐”（西德“议会政治新闻”），11月10日戴高乐发表声明，表示要推迟东西方最高级会议时，西德官方人士立即表示，戴高乐“像阿登纳一样也打算不那末急地参加会议”。现在西方通讯社纷纷报道法—西德轴心正在竭力抵制英国在这个问题上的主动精神。美国报纸在分析这种矛盾时说，阿登纳和戴高乐结伙的目的是要排挤英国而成为“世界第三种势力”（“纽约时报”），并向美国“在西方联盟中的领导地位提出挑战”（“纽约先驱论坛报”）。
    “波恩—巴黎轴心”露裂痕
    在最近一个时期来，西德和法国的“波恩—巴黎轴心”也不是平稳无事的。在“共同市场”内部，西德和法国的矛盾在增长。而最近西德报纸上也出现了越来越多的不满法国的言论。还在8月中法国总理德勃雷在演说中主张法国“必须拥有力量来使别人听取和了解它的意见”时，西德经常反映政府态度的“法兰克福汇报”就说，戴高乐要求使法国享有世界大国的地位，但是它“既没有力量也没有办法”。对此“我们德国人只能感到不舒服”。当法国政府宣布邀请赫鲁晓夫访问法国时，波恩政界人士认为这是对“阿登纳的外交政策上最沉重的打击之一”。而最近据西方通讯社透露，特别令阿登纳不满的是，“法国企图限制西德参加12月19日在巴黎举行的西方最高级会议，而成立美英法‘三人指导会议’的趋向”。阿登纳为此还写信给戴高乐提出“抗议”。西德的“世界报”还曾警告说：“希望戴高乐的政策不要迫使我们在美国和法国之间作出抉择，如果必须这样作的话，我们只得向法国道别”。但是法国的“法兰西观察家”周刊却认为阿登纳要使他的国家起一种至少与法国相等的大国作用的这种情况，已经使“波恩—巴黎轴心”“露出了裂痕”。
    小国和大国争权
    据消息透露，目前西欧各国的矛盾还不仅限于西德、英国、法国之间。美国“纽约时报”前几天说，由于西欧国家对美国的依靠的减少，使西方集团各国之间的关系复杂起来了。“许多国家和政府对别人不把自己当作一回事和受到像小伙计那样的对待已经感到有点厌倦”。这家报纸特别提到了意大利。据合众国际社说，目前意大利正在要求在西方政策决定中有更大的发言权。而塞尼总理12月访问英国，也就是要“使意大利参加西方最高级会议前进行的一系列会谈”。同时英国“新闻纪事报”也说：大西洋联盟内部正在酝酿危机，因为北大西洋公约组织的小国认为，“三大国不让他们参与演变迅速的外交形势”。
