Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from London: A correspondent for the British magazine "Time and Tide," Malik, wrote in a letter from Istanbul that "inflation and chaos dominate the Turkish economy."

The author points out that the Turkish government is unable to solve the economic difficulties facing the country. He writes that Turkey is in debt to every country in Europe except Denmark.

Most of the construction of Turkish enterprises and various buildings is funded by U.S. grants. The author points out that foreign grants help to subordinate Turkey.

Turning to the domestic political situation in Turkey, the author points out that the Menderes government is unstable. The author points out that most people in Turkey suspect that the Menderes government remains in power because it fabricated the results of the recent "elections."

The author writes that the Turkish national constitution has been repeatedly violated. According to Malik, the Turkish government has done everything to silence the newspapers. He writes that since 1954, twelve hundred journalists have been accused, fined, and imprisoned.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from TASS, Istanbul, December 12: The prices of some goods in Turkey have risen again. The price of textile products has risen by 15%, and the price of cement has risen by 20% to 25%.

According to the "National Daily," the price of textiles this year is 1221% higher than in 1939, the price of building materials is 1228% higher, and the cost of fuel is five times higher.

The newspaper sarcastically pointed out that Turkey is the champion of Europe in terms of rising living costs.

    通货膨胀　外债累累
    土耳其经济混乱政治腐败
    新华社讯　伦敦消息：英国“时与潮”杂志记者马里克在从伊斯坦布尔写来的一封信中写道，“通货膨胀和混乱统治着土耳其的经济。”
    作者指出土耳其政府无能解决摆在国家面前的经济困难。他写道，除了丹麦以外，土耳其在欧洲所有国家都有债务。
    土耳其企业建设的大部分和各种建筑都由美国拨款。作者为此指出，外国的拨款帮助使土耳其处于从属地位。
    作者在谈到土耳其国内政治状况时指出，曼德列斯政府的状况是不稳固的。作者指出，土耳其大部分人民怀疑曼德列斯政府之所以还掌握政权是由于它制造了最近的“选举”的结果。
    作者写道，土耳其国家宪法屡次遭到违反。据马里克说，土耳其政府为了迫使报纸沉默而做了一切。他写道，从1954年有一千二百个记者被控告、判处罚款和关在牢里。
    新华社讯　塔斯社伊斯坦布尔12日讯：土耳其一些商品的价格再次上涨。纺织工业品的价格上涨15％，水泥的价格上涨20％—25％。
    据“国家报”报道，纺织品的价格今年比1939年上涨1221％，建筑材料上涨1228％，燃料的成本上涨五倍。
    这家报纸讽刺地指出，就生活费用上涨而言，土耳其是欧洲的冠军。
