Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: Amidst the great autumn harvest, a vibrant mass movement to vigorously develop diversified economy has emerged in the rural areas of both North and South. People's communes in various regions have rationally arranged production, allocated labor, established specialized teams, gone up mountains and down rivers to seek wealth and take treasures, divided labor and specialized in raising livestock and poultry, promoting all five sectors of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, greatly increasing commodities and income. In Fujian, Shandong, and Gansu, over one million laborers have been投入 into the diversified economy front, while in many parts of Sichuan, the labor force engaged in diversified economy accounts for 15% to 20% of the total labor force. In just over two months, the income from diversified economy in six regions of Fujian Province reached over 130 million yuan, while in Heze Region of Shandong, over 150 kinds of sideline occupations were started in October, increasing income by 750,000 yuan in just ten days.

Fuzhou, November 3rd: In the past two months, the diversified economy activities in rural Fujian have been thriving, with a million-strong labor army going up mountains and down seas to seek wealth and take treasures, showing a great leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. According to incomplete statistics from the six regions of Nanping, Fuan, Jinjiang, Longxi, Longyan, and Minhou in the province, the cash income from diversified economy in the past two months has reached more than 134,890,000 yuan, with an average income of more than 49 yuan per farmer.

Over 90% of Fujian Province is a rich mountainous area, with dense forests and bamboo groves. Forest and sideline products, local specialties, and the aquatic resources of the coastal areas are extremely abundant, and the climate is mild, making it possible to develop diversified economy throughout the year. Encouraged by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, various regions have actively reorganized and expanded their diversified economy professional teams, seizing the gaps before the autumn harvest to vigorously develop diversified economy. In the Nanping and Fuan regions alone, the communes organized over 400,000 people to engage in diversified economy. In Fuan Region, the communes mainly engaged in collective operations, organizing 100,000 people to produce 800,000 bamboo poles, over 1 million bundles of firewood, 150,000 loads of charcoal, and over 40,000 loads of wild plants, as well as local paper and local pesticides, etc., from early August to late October, with a total income of more than 6.8 million yuan, equivalent to the total income from diversified economy in the first half of the year. Mountainous communes and forestry departments have produced more than 3.5 million cubic meters of timber, exceeding the annual timber production leap forward plan by more than 500,000 cubic meters ahead of schedule. Livestock production has also developed rapidly. The number of pigs in the province has increased from more than 3,070,000 in July to more than 3,412,000, an increase of 11%. The number of small poultry such as chickens and ducks has jumped from more than 16,940,000 to more than 25,690,000, an increase of 51%. Marine fishing has been rising month by month, and freshwater fish has also increased more than twice as much as in the same period last year. The production of other mountain forest specialties and small sideline occupations has also been rising rapidly. At the same time, many regions have also newly opened nearly 100,000 mu of orchards and tea gardens.

The vigorous development of diversified economy in various regions has fully demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes in comprehensively developing production. In Nanping Region, people's communes organized more than 8,560 fixed professional teams, temporary professional teams, and comprehensive professional teams, with more than 320,000 people, to engage in timber, bamboo, papermaking, and charcoal production. In Zhenghe County, a mountainous area in eastern Fujian, before the communization, the small scale of production organization and insufficient labor force made it impossible to fully utilize the mountain resources. This year, all communes and brigades in the county have rationally organized production and used labor, implemented division of labor and specialization, not only taking into account the management of autumn fields and diversified economy, but also improving labor efficiency. The county's ten major local specialties, including bamboo, have exceeded the highest records in history. In just over two months, the income from local specialties alone reached 1.23 million yuan, averaging 64 yuan per household, four times more than in the same period last year. Communes in various regions have also used the commune's relatively strong funds and natural resources to set up livestock farms, tea farms, and medicinal herb farms, expanding the scope of diversified economy.

Chengdu, November 3rd: A mass movement of thousands of troops vigorously developing diversified economy has already appeared in various parts of Sichuan. Many regions have established specialized teams for diversified economy, and the labor force currently投入 into diversified economy accounts for 15% to 20% of the total labor force.

Grasping planning, grasping characteristics, grasping timing, and grasping movement are the main characteristics of Sichuan Province's vigorous development of autumn and winter diversified economy. Generally, from the county and commune to the management district, development plans have been formulated at each level based on local natural conditions and natural resources, and arrangements have been made for diversified economy projects, required labor, and funds. For example, Jiange County in the Jianmen Mountain area has determined to focus on the collection of wild plants and charcoal burning based on local conditions. Mianyang and Suining counties, which have traditionally cultivated Ophiopogon japonicus and other medicinal materials, are focusing on the cultivation of traditional medicinal materials. In the area of small handicrafts, Tuojiang Commune in Jintang County has recently restored the production of more than 150 kinds of seasonal products.

Jinan, November 3rd: Since October, party committees at all levels in Shandong have been dispatching troops and generals to strengthen the diversified economy front. 250,000 people in Heze Region have taken to the field, engaging in more than 150 kinds of sideline occupations. In the first ten days of October, income increased by 750,000 yuan, an increase of 25% over the same period last year. In Licheng County, which has better conditions for diversified economy, the output value of sideline occupations in the first half of October reached 1.6 million yuan. The flames of the "small autumn harvest" with thousands of troops have also spread throughout the province. More than one million people are participating in the collection of wild plants. According to statistics from some counties and cities in Zibo and Linyi regions alone, more than 20 million catties of wild plants have been collected.

In order to strive to achieve the diversified economy plan for the fourth quarter ahead of schedule, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee recently held a telephone conference of secretaries of local party committees and city and county party committees, putting forward several specific measures and requirements. The Provincial Party Committee emphasized that there are extensive avenues for diversified economy, and it is necessary to implement the principle of combining large, medium, and small scales, both grasping key projects and engaging in large-scale sideline production, and accumulating small amounts to make a large whole; implementing the method of combining centralized operation and individual production, and adopting various methods to develop diversified economy.

Lanzhou, November 3rd: A mass movement of millions of troops vigorously developing diversified economy and greatly developing the benefits of mountains, waters, grass, and trees is unfolding in rural Gansu. People's communes throughout the province have set up sideline production teams, going deep into the mountains and forests, setting up camps, collecting wild plants, hunting and fishing, looking for mountain goods, mining minerals, developing commune-run industries, and carrying out short-distance transportation. In the four regions of Tianshui, Pingliang, Dingxi, and Zhangye, income from diversified economy increased by more than 14,800,000 yuan in half a month in October.

Party and government leading departments at all levels have strengthened leadership over diversified economy, organizing competitions between communes and teams. In order to support people's communes in developing diversified economy, commercial departments throughout the province have adjusted purchasing networks and expanded purchasing points, strengthening purchasing work.

    大兴山水草木家畜野禽之利
    福建四川山东甘肃人民公社分路取宝收入大增
    本报综合消息在秋季农业大丰收声中，南北农村中出现了热火朝天的大闹多种经营的群众运动。各地人民公社合理安排生产，调度劳力，建立专业队伍，上山下水觅财取宝，分工分业饲养畜禽，农林牧副渔五业俱兴，商品大增，收入大增。福建、山东、甘肃都有上百万劳动力投入多种经营战线，四川许多地方搞多种经营的劳力占总劳力的百分之十五至百分之二十。两个多月中，福建全省六个专区多种经营收入达一亿三千多万元，山东菏泽专区十月份搞起一百五十多种副业，十天内即增加收入七十五万元。
    本报福州3日电　福建农村的多种经营活动，近两个多月来，搞得热火朝天，上百万劳动大军上山下海觅财取宝，出现了农林牧副渔全面大跃进的大好局面。据全省南平、福安、晋江、龙溪、龙岩、闽侯六个专区的不完全统计，两个多月来，多种经营现金收入共达一亿三千四百八十九万多元，平均每个农户可收入四十九元多。
    福建省90％以上的地区都是富饶的山区，森林、竹林密布，林副业土特产和沿海地区的水产资源极为丰富，而且气候温和，一年四季都可以发展多种经营。在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，各地积极整顿和扩大多种经营专业队伍，抓紧秋收前的间隙，大闹多种经营。单是南平、福安二专区各公社就组织了四十多万人搞多种经营。福安专区各公社以集体经营为主，组织十万人从8月初到10月下旬的八十多天中，生产了毛竹八十万根、柴片一百多万担、木炭十五万担、野生植物四万多担，还有土纸土农药等，总收入达六百八十多万元，等于上半年多种经营收入的总和。山区公社和林业部门已生产木材三百五十多万立方米，超额五十多万立方米提前完成了全年木材生产跃进计划。畜牧业生产也迅速发展，全省生猪数量已由7月份的三百零七万多头增加到三百四十一万二千多头，增长11％，鸡鸭等小家禽由一千六百九十四万多只跃增到二千五百六十九万只，增长了51％。海洋捕捞逐月上升，淡水鱼也比去年同期增长一倍多。其他山林土特产和小宗副业的生产都扶摇直上。同时，许多地区还新辟了果园、茶园等近十万亩。
    各地在大搞多种经营的高潮中充分显示了人民公社全面发展生产的无比优越性。南平专区各人民公社组织了固定专业队、临时专业队、综合专业队八千五百六十多个、三十二万多人，投入了木材、毛竹、造纸、木炭等生产。福建东部山区的政和县，在公社化前，由于生产组织规模小、劳力不足，不能充分利用山区资源。今年，全县各个公社、大队合理组织生产和使用劳力，实行分工分业，不但兼顾了秋田管理和多种经营，而且提高了劳动效率。全县毛竹等十项大宗土特产都超过历史上最高纪录。两个多月中，光是土特产收入就达一百二十三万元，每户平均达到六十四元，比去年同期增加四倍。各地公社还利用公社较雄厚的资金和自然资源，举办畜牧场、茶场、药材场等，扩大了多种经营范围。
    据新华社成都3日电　四川各地已经出现千军万马大搞多种经营的群众运动热潮。许多地区建立了多种经营专业队，目前投入多种经营的劳力，已占总劳力的15％至20％。
    抓规划、抓特点、抓时机、抓运动，是四川省大兴秋、冬季多种经营的主要特色。一般地区从县、公社到管理区，都根据当地自然条件和天然资源，层层制订了发展规划，对多种经营项目、所需劳力和资金等都作了安排。如剑门山区的剑阁县，根据当地条件，确定以采集野生植物和烧木炭为重点，历来种植麦冬等药材的绵阳、遂宁等县，则大抓传统药材的种植。金堂县沱江公社最近在小手工业方面，就恢复了一百五十多种时令产品的生产。
    据新华社济南3日电　进入10月以来，山东各级党委纷纷调兵遣将，加强多种经营战线。菏泽专区二十五万人上阵，搞起一百五十多种副业，在10月份前十天，即增加收入七十五万元，比去年同期增长25％；多种经营条件较好的历城县，10月上半月的副业产值即达一百六十万元。千军万马大闹“小秋收”的战火，也燃遍全省。参加采集野生植物的群众有一百多万人。仅据淄博、临沂地区部分县市统计，已采集野生植物二千多万斤。
    中共山东省委为了争取提前实现第四季度多种经营规划，最近召开了各地委和市、县委书记电话会议，提出几项具体措施和要求。省委强调指出多种经营门路广泛，要贯彻大中小相结合的原则，既要抓重点项目，搞大宗副业生产，又要积少成多，集腋成裘；贯彻集中经营和个人生产相结合的方法，采取多种多样的方法发展多种经营。
    据新华社兰州3日电　百万大军大搞多种经营，大兴山水草木之利的群众运动，正在甘肃农村展开。全省各地人民公社纷纷组织副业生产队，深入山林，安营扎寨，采集野生植物，打猎捕鱼，找山货，挖矿石，发展社办工业，开展短途运输等。天水、平凉、定西、张掖四个专区在10月份半个月中，已从多种经营中增加收入一千四百八十多万元。
    各级党政领导部门对多种经营加强了领导，组织社与社、队与队之间展开了竞赛。为了支持人民公社发展多种经营，全省各地商业部门纷纷调整收购网和扩大收购点，加强收购工作。
