	A Poem Praising Revolutionary Heroes

	"The Song of Youth" is a successful film. It not only stays true to the spirit of the original novel, but also makes up for the novel's shortcomings. People who have seen the film feel that it is a poem praising proletarian revolutionary heroes and a testament to the Kuomintang reactionary government's shameful betrayal of the country. Seeing the danger of national subjugation but not being allowed to talk about resisting Japan, how could this not fill people with righteous indignation? The heroic images of Lu Jiachuan and Lin Hong, who were killed for the "crime" of resisting Japan, how could they not deeply stir people's hearts! The revolutionary martyrs sacrificed themselves, but people saw Lin Daojing's growth. The revolution will definitely develop, and the resistance against Japan will definitely succeed.

	The film's removal of the love relationship between Lu Jiachuan and Lin Daojing was necessary. After Lu Jiachuan's sacrifice, Lin Daojing only had an additional scene of reciting Lu's poems in the park. This does not detract from the perfection of Lin Daojing's image. The screenwriter mentioned Lu twice through Lin Daojing's dialogue with Jiang Hua and Dai Yu, showing that Lu's influence on Lin Daojing was still profound. This is more conducive to Lu's image than Lin's remembrance of Lu in the novel.

	The film also cut the love entanglement between Dai Yu and Wang Xiaoyan. In the novel, Dai Yu is portrayed inadequately as a cunning rabbit who betrays his comrades, while the depiction of the love entanglement between Wang Xiaoyan and Dai Yu is excessive. The screenwriter reduced this aspect, concisely and powerfully exposing the traitor's ugly face.

	The scene where Lu Jiachuan's arrest and sacrifice are immediately followed by Lin Daojing's break with Yu Yongze is another success of the screenwriter, particularly arousing the audience's hatred for Yu.

	New Year's Eve—usually a day for people to reunite, but where could the Northeastern students at Peking University find their hometown? Where could they see their parents? The beautiful and rich land of Northeast China was sold to the Japanese invaders by Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, on this night, the Northeastern students could only gather together and sing a song: "My home, on the Songhua River in the Northeast...". We were brought into that era of national and family demise, and at this time, the youth in the film shouted "I protest!" Yes, we must protest, we must protest, this was the roar of the Chinese people at that time.

	In addition, when Lin Daojing took the oath of joining the Party, she wore a red sweater that the audience was familiar with. This was a souvenir given to Lin Daojing by Lin Hong before her execution. Wearing this dress when taking the oath of joining the Party was by no means a coincidence. This is a concrete depiction by the director of the theme of "wildfires cannot burn them out, spring breeze brings them back to life," the details are concise and the meaning is profound. In short, the conception of the entire film is very vivid and rich.

### 歌颂革命英雄的诗章

    歌颂革命英雄的诗章
    “青春之歌”是一部成功的影片，它不仅忠实于小说原作的精神，而且还弥补了小说不足的地方。看过影片的人都有这样的感受：这是一部歌颂无产阶级革命英雄的诗章，也是国民党反动政府可耻卖国的见证。眼看亡国之危而不准说抗日之话，这怎么不叫人义愤填膺；因抗日“有罪”而被害的两个英雄形象——卢嘉川和林红，又怎么不深深激动人心！革命的先烈牺牲了，可是人们看到了林道静的成长，革命一定会发展，抗日一定能成功。
    影片切除了卢嘉川和林道静的爱情关系是必要的。卢嘉川牺牲以后林道静除了在公园里朗诵卢的诗外，再没有多余的镜头，这样并不损伤林道静形象的完美，编剧两次借林道静对江华、戴瑜的道白中提到卢，表现了卢对林道静的影响仍然是深刻的，这较之小说中林对卢的怀念更有利于卢的形象。
    对于戴瑜和王晓燕的爱情纠葛，影片也剪裁了。小说中的戴瑜作为表现同党为敌的狡兔，显得不足，而对王晓燕和戴瑜的爱情纠葛又描写得过多。编剧减轻了这一方面，简短有力地揭露了这个叛徒的丑恶面目。
    卢嘉川的被捕牺牲紧接着是林道静和余永泽决裂一场，更是编剧成功的地方，特别引起观众对余的痛恨。
    除夕的夜晚——照例这是人们团聚的日子，可是北京大学的东北同学到哪里去找家乡？哪里去见爹娘呢？东北这一块美丽富饶的国土被蒋介石出卖给日寇了。因此，这一天晚上东北的同学只能聚集在一起唱一首歌曲：“我的家，在东北松花江上……”。我们被歌声带进了那酸辛的国破家亡年代，就在这个时候，影片中的青年高喊“我抗议”，是的，要抗议、必须要抗议，这是那时候中国人民的怒吼。
    另外，在林道静入党宣誓时，穿了一件观众所熟悉的红毛衣，这是林红临刑前送给林道静的纪念物，在入党宣誓时穿这件衣服绝不是偶然的巧合，这是导演为“野火烧不尽，春风吹又生”这个主题思想作的具体描写，细节简练而意义深刻。总之，整部影片的构思都是非常生动丰富。　沈阳　吴时长
