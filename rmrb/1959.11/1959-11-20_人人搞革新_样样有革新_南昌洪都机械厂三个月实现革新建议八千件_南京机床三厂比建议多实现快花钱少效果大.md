The Nanchang Hongdu Machinery Plant has launched a mass movement centered on vigorously carrying out technological innovation. From August to the end of October, the plant has implemented 8,000 innovation proposals.

This year, Hongdu Machinery Plant has consistently adhered to the mass movement of vigorously carrying out technological innovation. After August, it focused on key production areas and extended the movement to every type of work. It required everyone to engage in innovation and everything to have innovation. At the same time, it also adopted the following series of measures:

First, implement the Party's spirit of opposing Right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, vigorously eliminate ideological obstacles to technological innovation, and mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses for technological innovation. On the one hand, the plant's Party committee organized all employees to deeply study the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee, criticized Right-leaning conservative thinking, and called on all employees to exert their utmost efforts and vigorously engage in technological innovation. On the other hand, it held a plant-wide on-site meeting on technological innovation in the wooden mold workshop, introducing the experience of this workshop in successfully completing its production tasks through vigorous technological innovation despite poor equipment and insufficient manpower. On this basis, the Party committee consciously established more than 130 technological innovation pacesetters in various workshops throughout the plant, calling on all employees to learn from and catch up with the pacesetters. As a result, a surge of technological innovation quickly swept through all employees. In September alone, more than 6,000 employees throughout the plant put forward more than 10,000 innovation proposals, and more than 6,000 were implemented that month, increasing work efficiency by one to fifty times.

Second, after the upsurge of mass technological innovation was launched, the plant's Party committee immediately struck while the iron was hot, organizing 168 technological innovation "shock teams" throughout the plant, based on workshops or work sections, to use the wisdom of the masses to tackle production difficulties. The "shock teams" were led by leaders at all levels and participated by innovation experts, workers, and technicians, focusing on breaking through major key problems in various types of work. In terms of methods, the main focus was on-site inspections and listening to the opinions of operating workers, and then, based on the specific situation, on-site consultations with the operating workers to identify problems and prescribe the right medicine. As a result, more than 200 major key problems that had not been solved for a long time were broken through in three months, which played an extremely important role in increasing production and practicing economy.

In order to promptly promote and develop the many advanced technologies and advanced experiences that emerged in the technological innovation movement in the same types of work, the plant's Party committee adopted two methods: 1. Holding mass rallies for technical performances to ensure that advanced technologies meet the broad masses in a timely manner and are widely disseminated. 2. Organizing outstanding advanced producers throughout the plant to establish advanced experience exchange teams, using their spare time to go deep into backward work sections and groups to deliver advanced experience to their doorsteps and help them carry out technological innovation movements.

　　本报讯 Nanjing Third Machine Tool Plant launched a mass movement of technological innovation that was more, faster, better, and more economical. The movement was centered on four comparisons: comparing who proposed more innovation projects, implemented them faster, spent less money, and achieved greater results. The plant proposed a total of 160 major innovation projects.

The most important contradiction in completing this year's fourth-quarter leap forward targets was that existing materials, equipment, labor, etc., could not meet the needs of continued leap forward. For example, the two work sections of the first machine tool processing workshop had a production capacity of only 30,000 work hours, but they were assigned a task of more than 36,000 work hours at the time. After analyzing this situation, the Party committee believed that the main way to solve the contradictions in production was to launch a mass movement to vigorously carry out technological innovation. The Party committee also conducted an inspection and summary of past technological innovation work. Through the summary, it was found that some workshops and groups spent less money and implemented innovations faster. Therefore, the Party committee decided to propose the requirements of comparing who proposed more innovation projects, implemented them faster, spent less money, and achieved greater results, and organized the masses to participate in a major competition.

Due to the clear requirements, the entire plant quickly set off a wave of learning from the advanced, competing with the advanced, proposing rationalization proposals, and vigorously carrying out innovations. After Zhao Changyun, a labor model from the Third Work Section, issued a challenge at the competition meeting to implement 17 innovation projects throughout the month, the Fourth Work Section immediately responded, expressing its intention to catch up with the Third Work Section. The workers of the Third Work Section also did not show weakness, and as a result, they carried out 17 innovation projects in one day, increasing efficiency by one to twenty times respectively.

With the deepening of the "four comparisons" competition, the enthusiasm of the masses for using their brains and finding tricks became increasingly high, and many employees who had previously done poorly in innovation also actively acted and joined the upsurge of vigorously carrying out innovation. Some workers in the foundry workshop used to think that they were dealing with sand and mud and that there was nothing to innovate. This time, in the "four comparisons" competition, they also joined the ranks of working skillfully. Among the 59 innovation projects that have been implemented throughout the plant, except for the cylinder grinding machine and the valve milling flat surface boring dual-purpose machine in the machining workshop, which cost several hundred yuan, other projects cost very little money.

    人人搞革新　样样有革新
    南昌洪都机械厂三个月实现革新建议八千件
    南京机床三厂比建议多实现快花钱少效果大
    本报讯　南昌洪都机械厂开展以大搞技术革新为中心的群众运动，从8月到10月底，全厂实现革新建议已有八千条。
    洪都机械厂今年来，一直坚持了大搞技术革新的群众运动。8月以后，以生产关键为重点，普及到每一个工种。要求人人搞革新，样样有革新。同时，还采取了以下一系列的措施。
    首先贯彻党的反右倾、鼓干劲精神，大力扫除技术革新的思想障碍，调动广大群众的技术革新积极性。厂党委一方面组织全体职工深入学习了党的八中全会决议，批判了右倾保守思想，号召全体职工鼓足干劲，大闹技术革新；另一方面，在木模车间召开了全厂技术革新现场会议，介绍了这个车间在设备差、人力不足的情况下，通过大闹技术革新而出色地完成了生产任务的经验。在此基础上，党委有意识地在全厂各车间树立了一百三十多个技术革新的标兵，号召全体职工学标兵、赶标兵。这样，一个技术革新热潮，便迅速在全体职工中掀起来了。9月份一个月内，全厂便有六千多名职工提出革新建议一万多条，当月实现六千多条，工效提高一倍到五十倍。
    其次，群众性的技术革新热潮掀起以后，厂党委立即趁热打铁，在全厂以车间或工段为单位，组织了一百六十八个技术革新“突击队”，运用群众的智慧，攻打生产难关。“突击队”由各级领导干部挂帅，革新能手、工人、技术人员参加，集中突破各个工种中的重大关键问题。在方法上，主要是现场察看和听取操作工人的意见，再根据具体情况与操作工人一道现场会诊，找出毛病，对症下药。结果在三个月内突破了长期未获得解决的重大关键二百多项，对增产节约起了极其重大的促进作用。
    为了把技术革新运动中出现的许多先进技术先进经验，及时在同工种中加以推广和发展，厂党委采取了两种方法：一、举行技术表演群众大会，使先进技术及时与广大群众见面，广为传播。二、把全厂突出的先进生产者组织起来，建立先进经验交流队，利用业余时间，深入到后进的工段、小组中去，把先进经验送上门，帮助他们开展技术革新运动。
    本报讯　南京第三机床厂发动群众开展了一个多快好省的技术革新运动。这个运动以四比为中心，即：比革新项目提得多、实现快、花钱少、效果大，全厂共提出重大革新项目一百六十项。
    这个厂在完成今年四季度跃进指标中，最主要的矛盾是现有材料、设备、劳动力等不能适应继续跃进的需要。如第一机床加工车间的两个工段，只有三万工时的生产能力，当时交给他们的任务却是三万六千多个工时。党委在分析了这一形势以后，认为要解决生产中的矛盾，主要途径是发动群众大搞技术革新。党委还对过去的技术革新工作进行了检查和总结。通过总结，发现有的车间和小组搞革新花钱既少，实现又快。因此，党委便决定提出比革新项目提得多、实现快、花钱少、效果大的要求，组织群众大比大赛。
    由于要求明确，全厂很快就掀起了学先进、比先进，大提合理化建议，大搞革新的热潮。三工段劳动模范赵长云，在比武会上提出全月实现革新十七项的挑战以后，四工段立即起来响应，表示要赶上三工段。三工段工人也不示弱，结果一天搞了十七项革新，分别提高效率一至二十倍。
    随着“四比”竞赛的深入开展，群众动脑筋、找窍门的积极性越来越高，许多过去革新搞得较差的职工也积极行动起来，投入了大搞革新的热潮。铸工车间有的工人，过去认为自己是和砂泥打交道的，没有什么革新好搞，这次在“四比”竞赛中，也投入了巧干的行列。全厂已实现的五十九项革新项目中，除了加工车间的汽缸磨缸机、汽阀铣平面搪孔两用机用了几百元以外，其他项目花钱很少。
