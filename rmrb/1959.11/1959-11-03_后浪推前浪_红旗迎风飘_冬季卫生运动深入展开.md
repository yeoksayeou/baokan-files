(Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd) Continuing to oppose right-leaning tendencies and promote enthusiasm on the health front, a large-scale winter patriotic health campaign is deepening across the country.

Since this summer and autumn, Party committees in various regions have strengthened their leadership over health work, with successive peaks in the mass patriotic health movement. The high tide of the summer and autumn hygiene campaign has just passed, and the waves of the winter hygiene campaign are rolling in promptly. The capital, which had launched several hygiene blitzes before National Day, began its winter hygiene campaign on October 27th, planning to launch three more high tides based on the central requirements of each period. The Huaiyin Special District in Jiangsu Province recently held a telephone conference for hygiene workers in its subordinate counties, criticizing the mentality of "taking a breather" and putting forward the battle slogan of "soldiers not unloading their armor, horses not stopping their hooves, continuing to vigorously carry out the winter hygiene campaign," and the movement quickly deepened throughout the district. Hunan Province has taken measures such as focusing on evaluations, experiences, advanced models, and systems to overcome complacency and slackness, and vigorously carry out the winter pest control and disease elimination campaign, with a focus on preventing and controlling schistosomiasis.

Various regions are carrying out hygiene campaigns closely linked to production. Many regions in the north are taking advantage of the harvest, autumn plowing, and winter irrigation to vigorously exterminate rats, investigate and dig up field rat holes, ensure clean fields and threshing grounds during the autumn harvest, and strengthen food management so that field rats and house rats have nowhere to hide and no food to eat. Provinces and regions in the south where schistosomiasis is prevalent are carrying out snail eradication in conjunction with autumn plowing, autumn planting, and winter water conservancy construction, successively forming a magnificent mass movement. Qichun County in Hubei Province, through summarizing the experience of production and snail eradication in 1958, held an on-the-spot meeting for commune cadres and professional schistosomiasis prevention and control cadres, combined with checking on ideology, enthusiasm, measures, and the completion of plans, and carried out an anti-rightist ideological struggle and a great debate, formulated a leaping progress plan for winter schistosomiasis prevention and control, and launched a new high tide of land reclamation and snail eradication centered on autumn planting and winter sowing.

Various regions are also combining the long-term planning of local socialist construction with the current production needs, taking measures that combine both short-term and long-term solutions to eliminate mosquito and fly breeding grounds and eliminate overwintering mosquitoes and flies. In cities such as Beijing, Wuhan, Changsha, and Guangzhou, sewage ponds are either filled and converted into orchards or dredged and replaced with water to be used as fish ponds, which beautifies the city and improves sanitation. In rural areas, people's communes provide unparalleled superior conditions for improving sanitation and eliminating pests and diseases. The Tuanfeng Commune Farm in Huanggang County, Hubei Province, originally had more than 150 mu of land with snails, which, due to the complex terrain and crisscrossing ditches, could not be completely eradicated in the past during the period of individual farming and mutual assistance cooperation. For many years, it had been a source of harm to the people. The commune Party committee mobilized more than 4,000 laborers to fight for ten days, filling all 24 ditches, 7 lakes, and 11 ponds with snails, fundamentally eliminating the source of snail infestation.

Since autumn, Party organizations in various regions have grasped both industrial and agricultural production in the anti-rightist and enthusiasm-boosting movement, and have also grasped health work, including pest control and disease elimination on the agenda. The Party committees of Beijing, Shanghai, Yunnan and other provinces and cities are led by the secretaries, who take the lead, and the plans are implemented at all levels, combining the central work and production of each period to uniformly arrange health work, so that one high tide of movement after another is launched. In Yan'an, the revolutionary holy land of Shaanxi Province, the four secretaries and five county heads of the county's Party and government leading organs are each responsible for one or several regions, leading production and health work at the same time, greatly promoting the development of the mass health movement. Various regions have also focused on inspections and evaluations, planting red flags, setting up models, and greatly boosting enthusiasm. The Central Patriotic Health Movement Committee organized four inspection groups, which went to nine provinces and autonomous regions in Northeast, East China, South China, and Northwest China for inspection. Twenty-one provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in Northeast, North China, Southwest, Central China, and South China organized seven joint inspection groups according to cooperative regions to conduct mutual inspection and evaluation between provinces and cities, creating a warm atmosphere of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced.

    后浪推前浪　红旗迎风飘
    冬季卫生运动深入展开
    据新华社2日讯　在卫生战线上继续反右倾鼓干劲，一个规模宏大的冬季爱国卫生运动，正在全国范围内深入展开。
    今年夏秋季以来，各地党委加强了对卫生工作的领导，群众性的爱国卫生运动一个高峰连一个高峰，夏秋季卫生运动的高潮才过去，冬季卫生运动的浪涛又及时滚滚而来。在国庆前曾掀起过几次卫生突击高潮的首都，从10月27日起又开始了冬季卫生运动，运动将根据每一时期的中心要求再掀起三个高潮。江苏省淮阴专区最近召开了所属各县卫生工作人员的电话会议，批判“松一口气”的思想，提出“兵不卸甲，马不停蹄，继续大搞冬季卫生运动”的战斗口号，运动迅速在全区深入展开。湖南省采取抓评比，抓经验，抓先进，抓制度，克服自满松劲情绪，大力开展以防治血吸虫病为重点的冬季除害灭病运动。
    各地密切结合生产开展卫生运动。北方的许多地区利用收获和秋翻冬灌的时机大力灭鼠，查挖田间鼠洞，秋收做到地净场光，加强伙食管理，使田鼠家鼠无躲身之地，无沾口之粮。南方流行血吸虫病的省区，都结合秋耕秋种和冬季兴修水利开展灭螺，已相继形成为一个规模壮阔的群众运动。湖北省蕲春县通过总结1958年生产和灭螺的经验，召开了公社干部和防治血吸虫病专业干部的战地会议，结合查思想、查干劲、查措施、查规划完成情况，进行了反右倾思想和大辩论，制订了冬季防治血吸虫病的跃进规划，掀起了以秋种冬播为中心的垦殖灭螺新高潮。
    各地还结合当地社会主义建设的长远规划和目前生产需要，采取一些治标治本相结合的措施，杜绝蚊蝇孳生地，消灭越冬蚊蝇。在北京、武汉、长沙、广州等城市，污水塘有的填平改建成花果园，有的疏浚换水作为养鱼塘，既美化了市容，又改进了卫生。在农村，人民公社为搞好卫生和除害灭病提供了无比优越的条件。湖北省黄冈县团风公社农场原来有一百五十多亩土地有钉螺，因地形复杂，沟渠纵横，过去在农民单干和互助合作时期都无力根治，多年来一直是为害人民的渊薮，公社党委发动四千多个民工，大战十天，把有钉螺的二十四条沟渠、七个湖荡、十一个水塘，全部填塞，从根本上歼灭了钉螺害源。
    从秋季以来，各地党组织在反右倾鼓干劲运动中大抓工农业生产的同时，也抓了卫生工作，把除害灭病工作列入议事日程。北京、上海、云南等省、市的党委，都是书记挂帅，领导上阵，计划层层落实，结合每一时期的中心工作和生产统一安排卫生工作，使运动的高潮一个又一个地开展起来。陕西省革命圣地延安，全县党政领导机关的四个书记和五个县长，都每人包干一个或几个地区，一边领导生产一边领导卫生工作，大大地推动了群众卫生运动的开展。各地还大抓了检查评比，插红旗树标兵，大鼓干劲。中央爱国卫生运动委员会组织了四个检查团、组，分赴东北、华东、华南、西北九个省和自治区进行了检查。东北、华北、西南、华中、华南有二十一个省、市、自治区，按照协作地区分别组织了七个联合检查团，进行省际和市际之间的相互检查评比，造成一个学先进赶先进的热烈气氛。
