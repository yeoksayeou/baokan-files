Combining Shock Campaigns with Regular Work
	Ai Wei

	To carry out sanitation campaigns, adopting both shock campaigns and regular work methods, and closely integrating the two, is a common experience put forward by various regions. Seriously adopting this working method can promote the continuous advancement of the sanitation movement wave after wave.

	Since last year, Beijing has been actively seeking ways to solve the problem of combining shock campaigns with regular work, and has therefore achieved great success in the sanitation movement. At present, on the basis of the achievements already made in several large-scale shock activities before the National Day, they are comprehensively grasping regular work, and, according to the specific situation, interspersed with shock activities to eliminate ditch rats, preparing for the large-scale sanitation shock campaign at the beginning of winter.

	The reason why sanitation campaigns must adopt these two methods, shock and regular, is determined by the long-term, arduous and complex nature of the sanitation campaign, as well as the relevant conditions for carrying out this campaign. Because the "Four Pests" cannot be completely eliminated in a short period of time, it is necessary to carry out shock campaigns and regular work according to the season and the breeding and activity of the "Four Pests", and fight them repeatedly and persistently. Concentrating manpower and material resources to launch shock activities in a relatively short period of time can eliminate a large number of "Four Pests" and eliminate their breeding conditions. However, to truly and completely eliminate the "Four Pests," especially mosquitoes and flies, shock activities alone are not enough. It is also necessary to regularly improve environmental sanitation, improve the treatment of feces and sewage, control their breeding places, pay attention to personal hygiene and food hygiene, etc.; at the same time, after each shock activity, following up with regular work is of more important significance for consolidating the results of the shock campaign.

	Factories, mines, communes, organs, and schools are currently engaged in a major battle in the fourth quarter, and production, work, and study are very busy. It is necessary to improve sanitation, but it should not affect production, work, and study. This requires properly arranging shock campaigns and regular work according to needs and possibilities, so that the sanitation movement can progress step by step and deepen step by step.

	Judging from the current situation, many places have paid more attention to sanitation shock campaigns, especially several major shock campaigns in a year, and have accumulated a lot of experience. This is still a main method of the sanitation movement, and work in this area should continue to be strengthened. However, regular work also needs to be given sufficient attention. Some places have relaxed regular work after achieving remarkable results in the sanitation shock campaign before the National Day, which is incorrect. This link should be grasped immediately so that the achievements already made can be consolidated and the movement can continue to advance.

### 突击运动和经常工作结合

    突击运动和经常工作结合
    艾卫
    开展卫生运动，采取突击运动和经常工作两种方式，并把二者密切地结合起来，这是各地提出的共同经验。认真地采取这种工作方法，就可以促进卫生运动一浪推一浪的不断前进。
    北京市自去年以来，积极想办法解决突击运动和经常工作相结合的问题，因而在卫生运动中获得了很大的成绩。目前，他们在国庆节前几次大规模突击活动已经取得的成绩的基础上，又全面抓紧经常性工作，并根据具体情况，穿插着灭沟鼠的突击活动，为冬初大规模的卫生突击运动作好准备。
    卫生运动所以要采取突击和经常这两种方式，这是由于卫生运动任务的长期性、艰巨性和复杂性，以及开展这一运动的有关条件所决定的。由于四害不能在短时间内一下子消灭干净，必须根据季节、四害繁殖和活动的情况等，开展突击运动和经常工作，反复地持久地与之作斗争。在较短时间内集中人力物力展开突击活动，可以大量消灭四害，消灭其孳生条件，但是要真正彻底地消灭四害，特别是蚊蝇，单有突击还不行，还必须经常地搞好环境卫生，搞好粪便及污水处理，控制其孳生场所；注意个人卫生和饮食卫生等等；同时，在每一次突击活动之后，继之以经常性工作，对巩固突击运动的成果更有重要的意义。
    厂、矿、公社、机关和学校等，目前正在大战第四季度，生产、工作和学习都很繁忙，需要搞好卫生，但又不能使它影响生产、工作和学习。这就必须根据需要与可能，把突击运动和经常工作妥善地加以安排，才能使卫生运动一环套一环、步步前进、步步深入。
    从当前的情况来看，对于卫生突击运动，特别是一年当中的几次大的突击，许多地方已经比较注意，而且已经积累了很多经验。这仍然是卫生运动的一种主要方式，应该继续加强这方面的工作。但是，对于经常性工作，也需要引起足够的重视。有些地方在取得国庆节前卫生突击运动的显著成绩以后，放松了经常工作，这是不对的，应该立即抓紧这一环节，使已经取得的成绩得以巩固，使运动继续前进。
