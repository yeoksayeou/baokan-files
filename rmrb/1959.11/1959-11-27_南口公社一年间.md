People's Commune Investigation Report

    One Year of the Nankou Commune
    Investigation Team of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Changping District Committee
                  Emerged in Response to the Times
    The Nankou People's Commune in Changping District, Beijing, has over 10,000 households and more than 40,000 people, covering an area of 810,000 mu, but 700,000 mu of that is towering mountains. Gravel washed down from the high mountains has paved the plains below into a large riverbed. Of the commune's 100,000 mu of cultivated land, only about 30,000 mu in the southeast corner is good land. Most areas suffer from a severe lack of water.
    Nankou, how many disasters have the residents of this strategically important place suffered in the old society! In the years of warlord strife, it was ravaged by artillery fire almost every year or two, and bandits were rampant at other times. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, Japanese devils and Kuomintang reactionaries burned, killed, looted, and plundered everywhere, making life unbearable.
    After liberation, the bitter years of the past were over forever. After the land reform and the cooperative movement, the people's spiritual and material life, compared with before liberation, was like heaven and earth. However, people's eyes are not looking backward; they demand to continuously leap forward, multiply production, accelerate socialist construction, and improve their lives, which encourages everyone to constantly think of new ways. In 1957, after the great socialist debate, the masses' ideological awareness was raised, and everyone used their brains, and many "Zhuge Liangs" emerged.
    At that time, the members of the Baiyangcheng Township's three advanced cooperatives were determined to solve the water shortage problem that had not been solved for many years. Someone proposed: Let's unite the three cooperatives, with more people and greater strength, and build a reservoir! This idea was immediately approved by the masses in the entire township. In December 1957, the water conservancy project officially started. All members of the three cooperatives started working together enthusiastically for nearly a month. However, counting the days, the season for accumulating fertilizer, delivering manure, and preparing for spring plowing was approaching, but only half of the dam foundation had been built. At this rate, it would not be completed in half a year. What to do? People began to realize: With only three cooperatives, there were still not enough people and not enough strength. They sent representatives to the neighboring Liucun Township to discuss merging the two townships. The water shortage situation in Liucun Township was even more serious than in Baiyangcheng Township. Therefore, the next day's cooperative member meeting passed a resolution to merge the townships. On the third day, the four cooperatives in Liucun Township, with 1,200 members, came to the Baiyangcheng Reservoir construction site with gongs and drums and fluttering red flags in a mighty procession. In this way, Baiyangcheng Township withdrew 300 people to engage in spring plowing, leaving 1,200 people, together with the labor force of Liucun Township, totaling 2,400 people, who worked hard for 130 days and built a reservoir with a capacity of 200,000 cubic meters.
    The members of the Longhutai and Gongnong advanced cooperatives both wanted to solve the problem of adjusting labor and land. The Longhutai advanced cooperative had few people and much land, so it could not be cultivated intensively, nor could it develop diversified operations. In 1957, the average grain yield per mu was only 110 jin, and the average annual income per person was only 37 yuan. Their neighbor, the Gongnong advanced cooperative in Nankou Town, had many people and little land, and they could not live by farming alone. Many people had to go out to work as coolies or engage in transportation, and production and life were very unstable. Both cooperatives had troubles that they could not solve on their own. In the spring of 1958, everyone came up with an idea: Why not merge the two cooperatives and learn from each other's strengths? Sure enough, after the merger, through unified adjustment of land and labor, production was very good. The average grain yield per mu in that year reached 239 jin, more than double that of 1957, and the average annual income per person was 60 yuan.
    During the summer farming season in 1958, the members of the Shijiaqiao Brigade of Yangfang Township discussed one after another that it was a waste of labor for each family to cook their own meals and send people to the fields to deliver meals. On July 1st, this brigade established a public canteen, and all 155 households in the village participated. The number of regular work attendees in the entire brigade immediately jumped from 98 to 173, an increase of nearly double.
    These few things aroused the envy of the cadres and masses of many other advanced cooperatives, and everyone wanted to follow suit. In September, the commune movement unfolded nationwide, and people suddenly realized that these things were what the commune was supposed to do! Why not simply combine the thirty-six advanced cooperatives and do it together! This is how the Nankou People's Commune came into being in response to the times.
              Peach and Plum Blossoms Compete for Beauty
    Now, this commune has just passed its first birthday. When mentioning its benefits, the members will take you to see the fruit orchards all over the mountains and plains, a fiery red expanse. Fruit trees are the cash cow for mountain farmers. Whether the commune is good or not, the fruit trees must speak first. Although this year's fruits have not yet been fully harvested, the output, conservatively speaking, must be more than 12 million jin, 63% more than last year, and twice as fast as the annual growth rate of 21% in the advanced cooperatives era. In terms of afforestation, the afforestation area before communization was 36,383 mu, and now it has developed to 89,146 mu, an increase of more than double.
    The fruit trees here, like the people here, suffered unspeakable hardships before liberation. Anyone who is a little older will tell you: "The warlords, bandits, Kuomintang, and Japanese devils were all beasts who squandered natural resources. They cut down fruit trees for firewood and cooking, and cut down fruit trees to build trenches. Watching the little things cultivated by generations of ancestors being ruined year by year, and barely hoping for a good harvest, they could not be transported out due to the chaos of war, so people lost the heart to take care of them. Therefore, before liberation, such a large fruit orchard produced at most three or four million jin of fresh and dried fruit a year."
    After liberation, especially after the cooperative movement, more effort was put into the fruit trees, and the annual output reached six or seven million jin. As the saying goes: "Fruit trees do not let people down. The more effort you put in, the more fruit they will bear." However, advanced cooperatives had their difficulties: they couldn't arrange enough labor, and the fruit trees that were planted were often eaten by cattle and sheep. It seemed that the output of six or seven million jin had reached its limit.
    After communization, with the establishment of canteens, nurseries, and other collective welfare undertakings, more women attended work, and water conservancy was built, so it was no longer necessary to use a lot of manpower and animal power to carry water for drinking. Therefore, the number of regular workers has increased by more than 5,000 compared with the 9,000 plus before the commune was established. With more people, it is easier to get things done. The commune extracted 698 people to form 48 fruit tree professional teams, and also initially divided the forestry area and the grazing area. The difficulties of not being able to arrange labor and cattle and sheep eating fruit trees were solved.
    Speaking of the fruit tree professional team, everyone wants to give a thumbs up. For example, in fruit tree pruning, over the past year, the professional team has pruned more than 210,000 fruit trees, ten times more than in 1957. Now, everyone says: The bumper fruit harvest is inseparable from the role of pruning. Even those who originally opposed the establishment of professional teams, opposed pruning, and satirized the professional team as "sawing tree team" have changed their tune and said, "It is indeed a well-deserved technical team."
    For example, in spraying pesticides, in the advanced cooperative era, pesticides were also sprayed when insects were discovered. However, there were so many fruit trees, and the labor force of a cooperative was small, so it was impossible to conduct universal inspection and preventive control. Pesticides could only be sprayed where insect pests occurred, so the effectiveness was small. This year, the professional team, based on the laws of pest breeding, took the initiative to search and attack, and first eliminated the insect eggs, so the effectiveness was naturally much greater. Pests such as the cutworms in the Taowa Management Area, the borers in Gujiang Village, the autumn worms in Xincun, and the jewel beetles in Baiyangcheng Village, which were difficult to control in previous years, were eradicated in advance by the professional team.
    In addition to pruning, spraying pesticides, loosening soil, topdressing, and watering fruit trees over the past year, the fruit tree professional team has also developed many new skills in fruit tree grafting methods. The Mapaoquan Fruit Tree Professional Team in the Laoyugou Management Area has improved and tested more than a dozen new methods. In the past, old fruit trees generally had to be cut down. Now, they have promoted a "rejuvenation" method, cutting off the branches of the old trees, leaving the trunk and dry branches untouched, and grafting branches of another fruit tree. A large number of fruits can be produced in the second year, and in the third year, it is impossible to tell that it is a newly grafted fruit tree.
    In terms of fruit tree management, the local farmers also have a traditional saying passed down through generations: "Don't expect a bumper harvest, hope for a bumper harvest, and worry when a bumper harvest comes." Why worry? Livestock, carts, and labor are limited. Wouldn't it be a waste to watch the fruit spoil if it can't be transported out? Now, the commune can organize transportation cooperation, and the problem of fruit spoiling simply does not exist. Take the Xincun and Baiyangcheng basic accounting units in the Liucun Management Area, which are rich in large white peaches and fragrant fruits, for example. This year, the total output of these two fruits alone is 830,000 jin. If only the eight carts of these two brigades are relied on for transportation, it will not be completed in two months. In order to ensure a bumper harvest and supply the market needs, the commune organized 13 carts from Shangdian and Beiliucun to assist, and they were transported in less than a month. When negotiating transportation prices, the members of Xincun and Baiyangcheng said: "If it weren't for communization, we wouldn't have a place to hire a car even if we had money. We must give people money fairly." The members of Shangdian and Liucun said: "Just give us a little bit. Their fruits are abundant, and giving more to the commune for accumulation also benefits us."
                  Flourishing Troughs
    When talking about pig raising, Comrade Qu Tiancai, the captain of the Huata Brigade in the Taowa Management Area, always says with full confidence: "Our suburban farmers must continuously increase the supply of pork needed by the four million urban residents of the capital." His words are indeed based on evidence. The entire brigade has a total of 800 people, with 1,000 pigs in stock, including 280 sows. Next year, they will strive to sell a fat pig to the state for each person. If the 2.8 million farmers in the suburbs of Beijing can be like them, the 4 million people in the city will have nearly 3 pigs to eat per year for every four people. This brigade's animal husbandry is relatively advanced. Although other teams are not as good as them, the development of pig raising over the past year must also be said to be a great leap forward. Before the end of August this year, the total number of pigs raised in the entire commune had cumulatively reached 32,000, 4,000 more than in the entire year of 1958 and 10,000 more than in the entire year of 1957.
    The leap-forward development of pig raising in the Nankou Commune over the past year has given a resounding slap in the face to those who doubted that communization was too fast. Please listen to the discussions of cadres and masses at all levels in the Taowa Management Area! They said: Communization has brought the superiority of "large scale and public ownership." Large-scale collective pig raising is a concrete manifestation of the superiority of "large scale and public ownership." Without this, it would be impossible to double the number of pigs within a year.
    First of all, let's talk about labor. Now, the personnel in the pig farms, including those who make feed, feed an average of 40 pigs per person, while in the past, when cooperative members raised 10 or 8 pigs, they had to occupy an entire labor force. In 1957, the Caozhuang Village Production Team developed pigs the fastest, and many people stopped working when an average of 7 pigs were raised per household. Zhou Wanjiang raised 29 pigs, and all three laborers in his family stopped working. The situation at that time was that farming and pig raising could not be combined, and some cooperative members were actually degenerating into the capitalist road of individual households. This contradiction was fundamentally resolved only by developing the collective pig raising industry.
    Let's talk about breeding piglets. In the past, cooperative members were generally unwilling to raise sows and had to buy piglets from other places. Often, they could not be fed well, and a large number of them died. This year, the management area and the production team have planned to raise more than 4,500 sows, which has laid a reliable foundation for raising 80,000 pigs by self-breeding and self-raising next year.
    At present, the total number of pigs raised collectively in the entire commune has reached 22,000, accounting for 70% of the total number of pigs raised in the entire commune, which is two and a half times more than the cumulative 6,000 or so pigs raised collectively before communization. The survival rate has increased from 70%-80% in the past to the current 97%. This is because in the past, each pig farm had an average of only 30 to 40 pigs. In order to save labor, they could only be fed and grazed together, regardless of size or strength. Small and weak pigs could not grab food, and they consumed more physical strength by running with the big pigs, which was not conducive to growth. Now, a pig farm usually has more than 100 pigs, which are grazed and fed in separate groups according to size and strength. Small pigs are no longer "bullied," so they live more and grow faster.
    At present, the commune is further implementing the policy of "walking on two legs," combining collective feeding and cooperative member feeding. For cooperative members raising pigs, under the principle of not affecting collective production, the pig farm supplies piglets without collecting cash, and the pig cost is repaid after the fat pigs are sold. In the future, with the leap-forward development of collective pig raising, the absolute number of individual pig raising will also increase somewhat.
          Thousand-Year Water Shortage Solved in One Year
    A myth once circulated here: In those years, Yang Liulang, who guarded the three passes, came to a small village near Nankou alone on horseback. The warhorse was thirsty, so Yang Liulang asked the local owner for water to drink for the horse. Although the owner sincerely loved this national hero, he had to sigh and tell him: "We don't even have water for people to drink here, where can we get water to drink for horses?" When Yang Liulang's divine horse heard this, it let out a long roar, raised its hooves and dug out a clear spring on the spot, drank its fill, and left. To this day, this village is still named Mapaoquan (Horse Hoof Spring). In fact, this "divine spring" can only produce six buckets of water per day. Why did people create a myth for such a small spring? It turned out that more than 20 villages in this area have suffered from severe water shortages since ancient times. Generally, villages are five or six miles away from the water source, and it takes a lot of manpower and animal power to transport water every day. Some villages have to use about half of their manpower and animal power to transport water. Villages such as Mapaoquan and Huangtuwa have to travel more than 30 miles of rugged mountain roads to fetch water, and they can only transport water once a day. In winter, the days are short, and they go out early and return late, not seeing the sun at both ends. Children as young as seven or eight years old carry gourds to fetch water, and they cannot go to school at all. In winter, when the mountain spring freezes, they have to accumulate snow and carry ice. In summer, on cloudy days, people move out all the furniture that can hold water to wait for rainwater. A basin of water for washing faces is repeatedly used by the whole family several times, and finally it is used to feed pigs or water livestock. If it doesn't rain, no one dares to wash clothes. Households that do not have the labor to transport water exchange a pair of shoe soles for a load of water to drink, which is really "water as expensive as oil." The local masses have a saying: "Rather give up a meal than give up a mouthful of water."
    After liberation, these villages have been constantly trying to solve the problem of drinking water, but due to the lack of labor and the restrictions of land boundaries, the difficulties have always been great. At the end of 1956, the Huangtuwa Agricultural Cooperative wanted to draw water from a place more than 13 miles away, but this project required 20,000 yuan and 4,000 workdays, which a small cooperative of 73 households could not afford. Moreover, this water diversion project would occupy a lot of land of the Changyucheng Agricultural Cooperative. The members of the Changyucheng Cooperative did not agree to occupy their land. Old cooperative member Zhang Fushan said: "Whoever dares to dig our land, I will lie in the ditch and wait to die!" Therefore, no village was able to completely solve the drinking water problem before communization.
    After communization, the superiority of "large scale and public ownership" is even more obvious here. The land is connected in pieces, and not only is the problem of land boundaries within the basic accounting units composed of several advanced cooperatives naturally solved, but also, because of the commune-level ownership, the problem of land boundaries between basic accounting units is also much easier to solve. The commune carried out large-scale cooperation in the team and management area according to the size of the project, solving the labor problem. The commune then gave them key economic assistance. For example, the Xinglongkou Canal in the Taowa Management Area was suspended midway due to insufficient cement. The commune transferred 90,000 jin of cement from the commune-run cement plant, and the canal was quickly built. Therefore, more than two months after communization, seven water conservancy projects started one after another. In less than half a year, more than 50 miles of water diversion canals and pipelines were built, which solved the drinking water problem for 18 villages. Over the past year, the Mapaoquan Production Team has also drilled 16 zhang of mountain caves and built cylinder tile water diversion pipelines on the basis of past water conservancy projects, so that the spring flows like a surge. What about the "divine spring" of the past? No one has taken water from it for a long time.
    Once the drinking water problem is solved, labor and animal power will also be greatly liberated, thereby promoting the development of production. When the water was first stored in the pool, many people shed tears in the cheers of "Long live the Communist Party, long live the People's Commune." Some old ladies in their seventies and eighties also helped their children to come and see the water. They said: "I have lived my whole life and have never seen a pool of clear water." Some said: "Good fortune comes from water, and water is brought by the commune." Others said: "It's really a thousand-year water shortage solved in one year, the Communist Party is better than a living god!"
              Spirit焕发
    In this short year, not only the mountains, rivers, gardens, and livestock have changed, but also the spiritual outlook of the people has changed. Of course, the masses here, like the people all over the country, have been happy since the day of liberation ten years ago, but further progress has to be said to have been made in 1958. Because, although production has been constantly developing and life has been constantly improving over the past ten years, due to the thin foundation and small business, as of 1957, there were still 4,500 households in the 36 advanced cooperatives that were overdrawn, borrowing, and receiving relief. Among them, only a few suffered special disasters such as funerals and illnesses. Most of them were because there were too many people and not enough labor, and their income was not enough to eat. After communization, the grain supply system was implemented on the basis of the great leap forward in production, and everyone had a share of food rations. This "iron bowl of rice" eliminated the households that were overdrawn, borrowing, and receiving relief due to lack of food. How could this not make people happy? The masses said: "This matter, those who have worried about eating and drinking understand it without saying it; those landlords and capitalists who have never worried about eating and drinking for generations do not understand it even if you say it." How about those with few people and a lot of labor? They said: "According to this year's accounts, 70% is distributed according to work points, and only 30% is supplied. The old and the young help each other, there is nothing to say; if someone cannot do a good job in production because of a heavy family burden and worries about eating and drinking, no one can benefit."
    The great leap forward in production and the general improvement in life naturally make everyone happy. In production, in addition to the great development of fruit trees and pig raising over the past year, 3,500 mu of vegetable land have also been newly opened this year, which has supplied 2.3 million jin of spring and summer vegetables to the market, and is expected to supply 8 million jin of autumn vegetables. The grain output in 1958 was 19.74 million jin, an increase of 19% compared with 1957, and the grain yield per mu increased by 45% compared with 1957. In 1959, the area of grain arable land decreased by 5,000 mu due to vegetable planting and state occupation, and the total output is expected to increase compared with 1958. From January to August 1959, sideline income was 1.5 million yuan, an increase of 60% compared with the same period in 1958. There were 21 kinds of sideline occupations, an increase of 5 compared with 1958. The commune and management area also established 22 factories for cement, agricultural tool repair, grain processing, bacterial fertilizer, etc., with an output value of 580,000 yuan from January to August.
    In 1957, the average income per household of the 36 advanced cooperatives here was 238 yuan, 286 yuan in 1958, and is expected to reach 398 yuan this year, an increase of more than 60% compared with 1957. If you include the pig raising income of all production teams and the individual sideline income of cooperative members, it will be much more.
    Women, who account for half of the population, have a deeper feeling this year than men. They said: "In the past, I got up before dawn to push the millstone and clean the house, cook three meals a day, take care of the children, breastfeed, wash diapers, and carry water, chop firewood, wash clothes, and feed pigs. After working hard all day, I had to make clothes for the whole family at night. I was so tired that I couldn't rest. Now? There are canteens, nurseries, and sewing groups. I get up in the morning when the bell rings, send the children to the nursery, eat breakfast, and go to the fields. I rest after lunch, and after dinner, I can attend meetings, learn culture, or visit and chat." They also said, "Everything is so organized and reasonable, saving me worry, and I eat more deliciously." The husband-wife, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law discord caused by worrying about eating and wearing, and the trivial housework, and the neighborhood disputes caused by children fighting and gossiping have been greatly reduced.
    The members of the Nankou Commune are very proud of the brilliant achievements of the commune over the past year. At present, they are enthusiastically carrying out a shock attack on winter production.

### 南口公社一年间
中共北京市委、昌平区委调查组

专栏：人民公社调查报告

    南口公社一年间
    中共北京市委、昌平区委调查组
                  应运而生
    一万多户、四万多人的北京市昌平区南口人民公社，面积八十一万亩，可是其中倒有七十万亩是巍峨屹立的山群。高山上冲下来的砂石把山下的平原铺成了一个大河滩。在全社十万亩已耕土地中，只有东南一角约三万亩的好地。大部分地区严重缺水。
    南口，这个历代兵家必争之地的居民在旧社会曾经遭受过多少灾难啊！军阀混战的年代中，差不多一两年就要遭受一次炮火的洗劫，平时也是盗匪横行。抗日战争和解放战争期间，
  日本鬼子、国民党反动派又到处烧杀抢掠，真是民不聊生。
    解放后，过去的苦难岁月永远结束了。经过土地改革、合作化运动，人民的精神和物质生活要和解放前比较，如天上地下。可是，人们的眼光不是朝后看的，他们要求不断向前跃进，成倍地发展生产，加速社会主义建设和改善生活，这就鼓舞着大家不断地想新办法。1957年，经过社会主义大辩论，群众思想觉悟提高了，大家开动脑筋，出现了许多“诸葛亮”。
    当时，白羊城乡三个高级社的社员下定决心要解决多年来没有解决的缺水问题。有人倡议：三个社联合起来，人多力量大，修它一座蓄水库吧！这个主意马上得到全乡群众的赞同。1957年12月水利工程正式开工，三个社的全体社员一齐动手，热火朝天地干了将近一个月。可是，屈指一算，积肥送粪，准备春耕的季节已经逼近，而坝基才作出一半，照这样下去，半年也修不成。怎么办？人们开始认识到：只有三个社，人还是不够多，力量还是不够大。他们就派代表去邻近的流村乡商量两个乡合并起来干。流村乡缺水的情况比白羊城乡还要严重。所以，第二天社员大会就通过了并乡的决议，第三天，流村乡的四个社、一千二百名社员就锣鼓喧天，红旗招展，浩浩荡荡地来到了白羊城水库工地。这样一来，白羊城乡就抽回了三百人去搞春耕，留下一千二百人，连同流村乡的劳动力，共有二千四百人，大干了一百三十天，一座蓄水二十万公方的水库就建成了。
    龙虎台、工农两个高级社的社员都想解决调剂劳动力和土地的问题。龙虎台高级社人少地多，不能精耕细作，也不能发展多种经营，1957年粮食平均亩产量仅有一百一十斤，每人每年平均收入只有三十七元。他们的近邻南口镇工农高级社，人多地少，光靠种地不能生活，不少人只好外出作小工、搞运输，生产、生活很不稳定。两社都有苦恼，自己不能解决。1958年春天，大家商量出了一个主意：两社合并，取长补短，岂不正好。果然，合并以后经过统一调整土地和劳动力，生产搞的很好，当年粮食平均亩产量达到二百三十九斤，比1957年增长一倍多，全年每人平均收入六十元。
    1958年夏季农忙期间，阳坊乡史家桥大队的社员们纷纷议论说，每家都自己做饭，还得每家派人往地里送饭，实在浪费劳力。7月1日这个大队就成立了一个公共食堂，全村一百五十五户都参加了。全大队经常出勤人数立刻由九十八名一跃而为一百七十三名，增加将近一倍。
    这几件事引起了其它许多高级社的干部、群众的羡慕，大家都想照办。9月，公社化运动在全国范围内展开，人们才恍然大悟；原来这几件事都是公社要办的啊！干脆，三十六个高级社合起来干吧！南口人民公社就是这样应运而生了。
              桃李争艳
    现在，这个公社刚过完它的周岁生日，一提起它的好处来，社员就要带你看看满山遍野、一片火红的果木园。果木是山区农民的摇钱树，公社好不好，就是得先让果木林说话。今年的果子虽然还没收完，产量往保守里说，也得一千二百多万斤，比去年多63％，比高级社每年增长21％的速度快两倍。在育林方面，公社化以前的育林面积有三万六千三百八十三亩，现在已经发展到八万九千一百四十六亩，增加了一倍多。
    这里的果木，也像这里的人民一样，在解放以前遭受的辛酸经历真是说也说不完。凡是上点年纪的人都会告诉你：“军阀、土匪、国民党、日本鬼，都是些暴殄天物的畜生，他们烧火做饭砍果树，修搭战壕砍果树，眼看多少辈祖宗栽培下的这点东西被他们糟踏的一年比一年少，好容易盼个丰收，也因为兵荒马乱而运不出去，人们也就没心收拾它了。所以，解放前，这么大一片果树一年顶多打三、四百万斤干鲜果。
    解放后，特别是合作化以后，给果木树下的功夫多了，年产量达到了六、七百万斤。俗语说的好：“果木不亏人，你多下功夫，它就多结果。”可是，高级社有它的困难：劳力安排不过来，栽了果树又常被牛羊吃掉。六、七百万斤的产量就好像已经到了头。
    公社化后，办了食堂、托儿所等集体福利事业，妇女出勤多了，兴修了水利，不需要再用很多人力和畜力驮水吃了。因此，现在经常出勤的劳动力比公社成立以前的九千多人增加了五千多人。人多好办事，社里抽出了六百九十八人，成立了四十八个果木专业队，又初步划分了林业区和放牧区，劳动力安排不过来和牛羊吃掉果木树的困难才算克服了。
    提起果木专业队来，真是人人要翘大拇指。譬如说果树剪枝，一年来，专业队给二十一万多棵果树剪了枝，比1957年的剪枝多十倍。现在，大家都说：果子大丰产和剪枝的作用分不开。连原来那些反对建立专业队，反对剪枝，把专业队讽刺为“锯树队”的人，也都改口说“真是名不虚传的技术队”了。
    又譬如说打药，高级社的时候，发现了虫子也打药，可是，果树那么多，一个合作社的劳动力少，不能普遍检查、预先防治，只能哪里发生虫害，才在哪里打药，效力就小。今年，专业队根据历来病虫孳生的规律，主动搜索出击，先把虫卵消灭，效力自然大得多。桃洼管理区的夜虎子虫、古将村的钻心虫、新村的秋虫、白羊城村的吉丁虫等历年难治的害虫，都被专业队预先根除了。
    果树专业队一年来除了给果树剪枝、打药、松土、追肥、浇水之外，还在果树嫁接方法上练就了很多新本领。老峪沟管理区马刨泉果树专业队就改进和试验了十几种新方法。过去果树老了，一般只好砍掉，现在他们推行了一种“老树还童”的方法，把老树的枝杈砍去，树干和干枝不动，接上另一种果树枝条，第二年就可以大量结果，而第三年就根本看不出来是新接的果树了。
    在果木经营上，这里的农民群众还有一句世代相传的俗语说：“不丰收，盼丰收，丰收来了也发愁。”怎么不发愁呢？牲口、大车、劳动力都有限，运不出去还不是干看着果子糟踏？现在，公社可以组织运输力协作，糟踏果子的问题就根本不存在了。拿盛产大白桃和香果的流村管理区的新村、白羊城两个基本核算单位来说，今年光这两项果子的总产量就有八十三万斤，如果只靠这两个大队的八辆大车运输，两个月也运不完。为了保证丰产丰收，供应市场需要，公社就组织了上店、北流村的十三辆大车前来协助，不到一个月就运完了。在协商运价的时候，新村、白羊城的社员说：“要不公社化，有钱也没地方雇车去，一定得公公道道地给人家钱。”上店、流村的社员说：“多少给点就行了，人家果子丰收，多给公社交积累，也有我们的份儿。”
                  槽头兴旺
    桃洼管理区花塔大队队长屈天才同志在谈到养猪的时候，总是信心百倍地说：“我们郊区农民一定要不断增加供应首都四百万城市居民所需要的猪肉。”他的话可的确有根据。全大队一共八百人，现有存栏猪一千口，其中母猪二百八十口，明年他们争取每人卖给国家一口肥猪。如果北京郊区二百八十万农民都能和他们一样，城市四百万人，每四个人一年就有将近三口猪吃。这个大队的牧畜业是比较先进的，别的队虽比不上他们，可是一年来养猪事业的发展也得说是大跃进。今年8月底以前，全公社的养猪数量已经累计完成三万二千口，比1958年全年多四千口，比1957年全年多一万口。
    南口公社一年来养猪事业飞跃的发展，给了那些怀疑公社化太快了的人们一记响亮的耳光。请听一下桃洼管理区各级干部和群众的谈论吧！他们说：公社化带来了“一大二公”的优越性，大规模集体养猪就是“一大二公”优越性的一种具体表现，没有这一手，一年之内要猪加番是怎么也办不到的。
    先说劳动力。现在养猪场的人员，包括打饲料的人在内，每人平均喂养四十口猪，而过去社员养猪养到十口八口的，就得占一个整劳动力。曹庄村生产队1957年发展猪最快，平均一户养到七口猪就有许多人不出勤了。社员周万江养了二十九口猪，家里三个劳动力全不出勤。当时的形势是种地和养猪不能兼顾，有些社员实际上在向单干户的资本主义道路上蜕化。这个矛盾只有发展了集体养猪事业才得到了根本解决。
    再拿繁殖仔猪来说，过去社员一般不愿意养母猪，要从外地买仔猪，常常是饲养不好，就死一大堆。今年，管理区、生产队有计划地饲养了四千五百多口母猪，这就为明年自繁自养八万口猪打下了可靠的基础。
    现在，全公社集体喂养的猪累计达到二万二千口，占全公社养猪总数的70％，比公社化以前集体养猪累计六千多口增加了两倍半，成活率由过去的70％—80％提高到目前的97％。这是因为过去每个猪场平均一般只有三、四十口猪，为了节省劳动力，只能不分大小、壮弱一齐喂养放牧，小猪、弱猪抢不着食吃，随着大猪跑，消耗体力多，就不利于生长。现在，一个猪场平常都有一百口以上的猪，按大小、壮弱分群放牧、分群喂养，小猪不“受气”了，就活得多了，长得快了。
    现在，这个社正在进一步贯彻集体喂养和社员喂养相结合的“两条腿走路”的方针。对于社员养猪，在不影响集体生产的原则下，猪场供给仔猪，不收现款，卖了肥猪以后再还猪本。今后随着集体养猪事业的飞跃发展，个体养猪的绝对数还将有所增加。
          千年缺水一年解决
    这里曾流传着一段神话：当年，镇守三关的杨六郎单身独骑来到南口附近的一个小小村庄。战马渴了，杨六郎就找当地主人求水饮马，主人虽然衷心爱戴这位民族英雄，却不得不叹息地告诉他：“我们这里连人吃的水都没有，哪里来的水饮马啊？”杨六郎的神马闻言，长啸一声，举蹄就地刨出了一股清泉，饱饮而去，至今这个村庄仍以马刨泉为名。其实这个“神泉”每天只能出六桶水。人们为什么为了这样一个小泉而创造一段神话呢？原来这一带共有二十多个村庄自古以来严重缺水，一般村庄离水源都五、六里远，每天要花费很多人力、畜力运水。有的村要用一半左右的人力和畜力运水，马刨泉、黄土洼等村取一次水往返要走三十多里崎岖的山路，一天只能驮一次水，冬天日短，早出夜归还两头不见太阳。孩子一到七、八岁就提着葫芦去取水，根本不能上学。冬天山泉冻了，就只好积雪背冰，夏天一阴天，人们就把所有能盛水的家具搬出来等接雨水。一盆洗脸水，全家反复用几次，最后还要用来喂猪或饮牲口。不下雨，谁也不敢洗衣服。没有劳动力运水的户，纳一双鞋底才换一驮水吃，真是“水贵如油”。当地群众有句俗语：“宁舍一顿饭，不舍一口水。”
    解放后，这些村庄曾不断地设法解决吃水问题，但是由于劳动力少，又有地界限制，总是困难重重。1956年底，黄土洼农业合作社想从十三里多远的地方把水引来，但是这个工程需要两万元、四千个工，一个七十三户的小社当然办不到。而且，这个引水工程要占长峪城农业合作社很多土地，长峪城社的社员不同意占他们的地，老社员张福山说：“谁敢挖我们的地，我就躺在沟里等死！”因此，没有一个村庄在公社化以前能彻底解决吃水问题。
    公社化后，“一大二公”的优越性在这里就表现得更清楚了。土地连成片，不仅由几个高级社所组成的基本核算单位之内的地界问题自然得到解决，而且，由于有了公社一级的所有制，各基本核算单位之间的地界问题也好解决多了。公社根据工程大小；在队和管理区内开展了大协作，解决了劳动力的问题。公社在经济上再有重点地帮助他们。例如，桃洼管理区兴隆口渠道因为水泥不足而中途停工，公社就由社办的水泥厂调去了九万斤水泥，渠道就很快修成了，所以，公社化后两个多月，七处水利工程就都先后开工。不到半年时间，修好了五十多里长的引水渠和引水管道，这就解决了十八个村的饮水问题。马刨泉生产队一年来也在过去的水利工程的基础上，凿了十六丈山洞，修建了缸瓦引水管道，做到泉流如涌。当年的“神泉”呢？早就没人从它那儿取水了。
    吃水问题一经解决，劳动力和畜力也就获得了大解放，从而促进了生产的发展。在水池第一次蓄水的时候，多少人在“共产党万岁，人民公社万岁”的欢呼声中落下了热泪。有些七、八十岁的老太太也扶着孩子赶来看水。她们说：“活了一辈子还没见过一池清水。”有的说：“福是水冲来的，水是公社带来的。”还有的说：“真是千年缺水，一年解决，共产党赛过活神仙！”
              精神焕发
    在这短短的一年中，不仅山水，园林、牲畜变了样，人的精神面貌也变了样。当然，这里的群众也像全国人民一样，打从十年前解放那天起，心情就是舒畅的，而百尺竿头更进一步，还得说是在1958年。因为，十年来固然生产不断发展，生活不断提高，可是，由于原来的底子太薄，家业还小，直到1957年，三十六个高级社里还有超支、借贷、救济户四千五百户，其中，因为遭了丧葬、疾病等特殊灾患的只是少数，多数还是因为人多劳动力少，收入不够吃。公社化后，在生产大跃进的基础上实行了粮食供给制，每人都有一份口粮，这个“铁碗饭”便一下子消灭了因缺粮而产生的超支、借贷、救济户，这件事怎么不叫人高兴呢？群众说：“这件事，对愁过吃喝的人，不说就明白；对几辈子没愁过吃喝的地主、资本家们，说了也不明白。”人口少、劳动力多的怎么说呢，他们说：“按今年的账算下来，七成按工分分配，只有三成搞供给，老的小的大家帮点，没的说；要是有人因为家累大，愁吃喝，生产搞不好，谁也沾不了光。”
    生产大跃进，生活普遍提高，大家当然高兴。在生产上，一年来，除了果树、养猪大发展以外，今年还新开了菜地三千五百亩，已经供应了市场春、夏菜二百三十万斤，预计还可以供应秋菜八百万斤。1958年粮食产量一千九百七十四万斤，比1957年增加19％，粮食亩产量比1957年增加45％，1959年粮食耕地面积因种菜和国家占地减少五千亩，预计总产量还可以比1958年增加。1959年1月到8月，副业收入一百五十万元，比1958年同期增加60％，副业种类二十一种，比1958年增加五种。公社和管理区还办了水泥、农具修理、粮食加工、细菌肥料等工厂二十二个，1到8月份产值达到五十八万元。
    1957年，这里的三十六个高级社平均每户收入二百三十八元，1958年为二百八十六元，今年预计可以达到三百九十八元，比1957年增长60％多。如果算上生产队所有的养猪收入和社员的个人副业收入，就还要多的多。
    占人口一半的妇女这一年来的感受比男人还深一层。她们说：“过去天不亮就起来推碾子、收拾屋子，一天做三顿饭、带孩子、喂奶、洗屎洗尿，还得挑水、打柴、洗衣、喂猪，忙活一天，夜里还要做一家人的穿戴，累死累活，不得休息。现在呢？有食堂、托儿所、缝纫组。早晨打钟起床，送孩子到托儿所，吃了饭就下地，午饭后休息，晚饭后可以参加开会、学文化，要么，就串门聊天。”又说，“真是什么都有条有理，省得操心，吃饭也香了。”多少年来为愁吃愁穿、为繁琐的家务事而引起的夫妻、婆媳不和，为孩子打架和扯闲话而引起的邻里纠纷，都大大减少了。
    南口公社的社员对公社一年来的辉煌成就很感自豪，目前他们正在热火朝天地突击冬季生产。
