    Open and Covert Struggles
    —Behind the Nixon and Rockefeller Campaigns
    Lè Shān
    For a year, the American bourgeois press has published many messages about the struggle between US Vice President Nixon and New York Governor Rockefeller for the 1960 Republican presidential nomination. Although neither of them has formally announced that they would be candidates for the Republican nomination, their recent activities show that the open and covert struggle between them has reached a fever pitch. On November 6, Nixon's supporters began campaigning in New Hampshire; but people know that after Rockefeller was elected Governor of New York in November 1958, it was New Hampshire that first put up the sign "Elect Rockefeller President." On November 11, Rockefeller set off for the western states of California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho for his first important "political tour"; and California is Nixon's home state, and Oregon is the hub of Nixon's campaign. Anyone can see through this "hit the snake on the head" trick at a glance.

    Nixon's Path to High Office

    Nixon was brought to the political stage by reactionary Southern California capitalists. In 1946, he relied on the support of bankers, railway managers, and farmers in California to become a member of Congress. Smith, a large capitalist in Santa Maria, California, contributed $10,000 to Nixon's campaign.

    After becoming a member of Congress, Nixon immediately became the darling of the third largest financial group after Morgan and Rockefeller—the California Group, headed by Giannini. This group owns a large number of military industries along the Pacific coast. Its controlled "Bank of America" had already established twelve overseas branches by 1955. One of its core companies, "Transamerica Corporation," controls hundreds of banks in California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. The "Kaiser" industrial empire jointly funded by "Bank of America" and "Transamerica Corporation" owns shipyards, automobile factories, steel plants, and aluminum plants (with a production capacity accounting for about 30% of the country).

    Nixon "repaid his gratitude" by serving the big capitalists wholeheartedly. In 1947, he participated in drafting the Taft-Hartley anti-labor bill; soon after, he showed his skills in the "Un-American Activities Investigation Committee." In 1950, with the support of various consortia, Nixon was elected as a senator.

    In 1952, when Nixon ran for Vice President, he received private bribes from dozens of capitalists. These included the California oil tycoon Herbert Hoover Jr. and others who later received positions in the Eisenhower administration. Nixon's campaign for Vice President was promoted by Wall Street political broker Dewey Brunnell. This fact shows that Nixon not only won the favor of the Western monopoly groups, but also won the favor of the Wall Street forces that compete with the Western monopoly groups. This is why he was re-elected as Vice President in 1956.

    Nixon once said: "Since I entered politics, I have been smooth sailing. The positions of Congressman, Senator, and Vice President all came automatically. I am often in the right position at the right time." This sentence is a portrayal of his political life as an agent of the capitalists.

    In order to put Nixon on the presidential throne, the giants and politicians of certain financial groups have been planning meticulously for a long time. Pirelli, the manager of "Bank of America," once promised to elect Nixon as President of the United States in 1960. Some financial tycoons and politicians in the Midwest of the United States are also planning for him.

    At the behest of the capitalists, Nixon put on the guise of "New Nixon." Now Nixon keeps saying things like "When I travel abroad...", because the capitalists believe that expanding influence in international affairs is an important capital for winning the presidential throne. Nixon, who has always had a sense of racial superiority, now acts as the host of investigating racial discrimination in government engineering contracting in order to win black votes. In order to expand his influence on housewives, Nixon also promised to serve as the chairman of the "Committee for Economic Development and Price Stability." Of course, what is particularly important is that Nixon is now openly advocating the Cold War and resisting the easing of the international situation, which is what the most expansionist and hawkish forces of the American monopoly capital group urgently need. Nixon's recent speech at the University of Los Angeles, advocating the "Cold War," is a naked example.

    Rockefeller Moves from Behind the Scenes to the Forefront

    At the end of 1955, when Nelson Rockefeller, the political star of the Rockefeller Consortium, resigned from his position as Special Assistant to the President, he came to an experience: "If the government is to be more obedient to the will of the Rockefeller Consortium, it must truly enter the officialdom, and no longer appear as an amateur." Within a few months of returning to New York, Rockefeller revealed this intention to Moorehouse, chairman of the Republican New York State Committee, at a Republican fundraising meeting. Moorehouse immediately took action and appointed Rockefeller as chairman of the state committee to study the New York State Constitution, giving him the opportunity to understand the overall situation in New York and come into contact with people. This was the starting point for Rockefeller to move from behind the scenes to the forefront, attempting to jump further to the presidential throne by running for Governor of New York.

    In November 1958, within a few hours after Rockefeller was elected Governor of New York, the call to "Elect Rockefeller President" appeared in New Hampshire. Then, retired Federal Judge Lefert came forward to preside over the "Elect Rockefeller President" movement.

    Rockefeller has been active in the Washington officialdom for twenty years. He has successively served as "Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs," Assistant Secretary of State in charge of Latin American affairs, Director of the International Development Advisory Board, Director of the Federal Agency Adjustment Committee, Deputy Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and Special Assistant to the President for Foreign Policy. He has drafted many reactionary plans for the US government and submitted many reactionary memorials. The arrogant plan to place the world under the rule of the Rockefeller dynasty—Rockefeller's secret letter to Eisenhower in 1956—is his "masterpiece." The report openly advocating nuclear weapons war—the so-called "Report on International Security and Military Situation" in January 1958, and the plan to step up foreign economic expansion—the so-called "Report on Foreign Economic Policy in the Twentieth Century" in June 1958, are all "contributions" of the "Rockefeller Research Group."

    The Rockefeller Consortium has a powerful influence. It controls two-fifths of the capitalist world's oil production and has formed a huge oil empire centered on "Standard Oil of New Jersey" and "Chase Manhattan Bank." According to statistics in 1955, the capital it controls and controls has reached as high as 61.4 billion US dollars. The capital of the Rockefeller Consortium has long extended into many sectors of the US economy. It directly and indirectly participates in the production of American aviation, electronics, military chemical industry, rockets, and missiles.

    For decades, the political activities of the Rockefeller Consortium have mainly been to use pressure through oil companies to get its personnel into the government. After World War I, Standard Oil began an unprecedented overseas expansion, and the Rockefeller Consortium intervened in diplomatic affairs. After World War II, increasing the United States' oil interests became the primary task of the US State Department, and protecting oil interests became the main task of the US overseas garrison. Former Rockefeller Foundation Chairman Dulles became Secretary of State, and his brother Allen Dulles, who had served as an advisor to the Rockefeller family, also served as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Through its political progress, the Rockefeller Consortium has increased its control over prices and production, strengthened its competitive and merger power, and become the most powerful monopoly organization in the United States.

    However, with the development of the world situation, the economic leap of socialist countries, and the deepening of the US political and economic crisis, the most aggressive and war-mongering forces in the US monopoly group are unwilling to accept their failure and are actively trying to personally seize power in order to make a dying struggle. This is the reason why Rockefeller moved from behind the scenes to the forefront.

    Intrigue

    Although the Rockefeller Consortium is the most powerful consortium in the United States, today's United States is still a situation where several major consortia—Morgan, DuPont, Mellon, "First National City Bank of New York," Cleveland, Chicago, and "Bank of America"—are evenly matched. These consortia have also launched the so-called "business into politics" movement. The Mellon Consortium's Gulf Oil Company has already issued a declaration that it will "actively participate in politics" in the future, and DuPont and Ford Motor Company have made similar statements. Morgan Consortium's General Electric Company specifically established a "Government Relations Department" last year to organize its managers to "participate in political activities."

    The various monopoly groups in the United States have a consistent side in the fundamental policy of foreign aggression and expansion, but due to the deepening of the US political and economic crisis and the heavy contradictions between monopoly capital organizations, the various monopoly groups have increasingly divergent views on the methods and priorities of policy implementation from different scopes of interests.

    Twenty-five years ago, the assets of the Morgan Consortium were twice that of the Rockefeller Consortium, but now the two are equal. However, through oil investment and the ubiquitous plunder of underdeveloped countries, the Rockefeller Consortium has seen a sharp increase in profits, and its power has grown much more than the Morgan Consortium, and its influence on the government is far greater than that of the Morgan Consortium.

    In the past, the US presidents, such as Grant, Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, and Wilson, were all selected by the Morgan Group. Until recent years, the Rockefeller Consortium has had a greater say in the selection of US presidents than the Morgan Consortium.

    The Morgan Consortium is unwilling to be squeezed out by the Rockefeller Consortium and has launched a large-scale counterattack in the economy. At the beginning of this year, the merger of the two major companies under the Morgan Consortium and the expansion of the Morgan's American Telecom Company's increase in stock issuance are strategic actions aimed at the Rockefeller Consortium.

    The financial groups in the Midwest of the United States, etc., either focus on the domestic market or focus on operating civil industries. They oppose the unlimited increase in military expenditures, and they are worried that the sharp increase in fiscal deficits will lead to economic bankruptcy. These financial groups also have differences with the Rockefeller and other financial groups who advocate madly expanding armaments and preparing for war and stepping up foreign economic expansion to delay and shift the economic crisis.

    Now, Rockefeller has fully invested in the campaign. But he has always refused to publicly announce his participation in the election. The "New York Times Magazine" on November 1 explained why this is the reason. This American magazine said:

    "Governor Rockefeller's statement that he is not a candidate should be interpreted differently. What he means is: 'Unless I am fully convinced that I am confident of defeating Nixon in the campaign, I am unwilling to put myself in a vulnerable position'." "A governor who announces that he is a presidential candidate will provoke attacks from political opponents, saying that he is obsessed with the White House and harms the interests of the state."

    However, the American "Time" Weekly revealed Rockefeller's impatience. It said that at the Rockefeller campaign strategy meeting held in mid-September, the political star of the Rockefeller Consortium shouted loudly: "Damn it! Let's get started! I'm going to do it. As for other people's speculation, what does it matter? Anyway, whether you do it or not, people will speculate."

    Now, it is too early to judge who will win. But no matter what the future holds, Rockefeller's campaign shows that the way in which billionaires use the "democratic" cloak to conceal their behind-the-scenes rule is increasingly unable to adapt to the urgent situation of dying.

    明争暗斗
    ——尼克松、洛克菲勒竞选幕后
    乐山
    一年以来，美国资产阶级报刊登载了不少关于美国副总统尼克松和纽约州长洛克菲勒争夺1960年共和党总统候选人的消息。尽管两个人都没有正式宣布要作共和党提名的候选人，可是他们最近的活动，却说明了他们之间的明争暗斗已经达到了白热化的阶段。11月6日，尼克松的支持者在新罕布什尔州开始了竞选活动；但人们知道，1958年11月洛克菲勒当选为纽约州长以后，首先捧出“选洛克菲勒当总统”这块招牌的，正是新罕布什尔州。11月11日，洛克菲勒动身前往西部加利福尼亚、俄勒冈、华盛顿、爱达荷各州作第一次重要的“政治性巡视”；而加利福尼亚正是尼克松的老家，俄勒冈正是尼克松竞选运动的中枢。这种“打蛇先打头”的把戏，明眼人一眼就可以看穿。
    尼克松的登龙术
    尼克松是由反动的南加利福尼亚资本家捧上政治舞台的。1946年，他依靠加利福尼亚州的银行家、铁路公司经理、农场主的支持当上了众议员。加利福尼亚州圣马利亚城大资本家史密斯为尼克松的竞选曾出资一万美元。
    尼克松当上众议员以后，立刻成了仅次于摩根和洛克菲勒的第三个大金融集团——以基安尼尼为首的加利福尼亚集团——的宠儿。这个集团在太平洋沿岸地带拥有大批军事工业。它所控制的“美洲银行”，到1955年为止，就已经设立了十二个国外分行。它的一个核心“美通公司”控制着加利福尼亚、亚利桑那、内华达、俄勒冈和华盛顿五个州的数百家银行。“美洲银行”和“美通公司”共同资助的“凯塞”工业帝国拥有造船厂、汽车制造厂、钢铁厂、铝厂（生产能力占全国30％左右）。
    尼克松“感恩图报”，为大资本家力效犬马之劳。1947年，他参加了塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法案的起草；不久，又在“非美活动调查委员会”中大显身手。1950年，在形形色色的财团支持之下，尼克松当选为参议员。
    1952年，尼克松竞选副总统，他得到了几十个资本家的私人贿赂。其中包括加利福尼亚州的石油财阀小赫伯特·胡佛和其他一些后来在艾森豪威尔政府中得到职位的人。尼克松竞选副总统是由华尔街政治掮客杜威·布朗奈尔提拔的。这件事实说明尼克松不但赢得了西部垄断集团的青睐，也博得与西部垄断集团处于竞争地位的华尔街势力的欢心。这也就是他于1956年再度当选副总统的原因。
    尼克松曾经说：“我自从进入政界以来，一直是一帆风顺的。众议员、参议员、副总统的职位，都是自动来的。我常常是在适当的时间占着适当的地位。”这一句话是他那充当资本家代理人的政治生活的写照。
    为了使尼克松登上总统的宝座，某些金融集团的巨头和政客早就苦心孤诣地进行策划。“美洲银行”经理皮莱曾经许愿要在1960年把尼克松选为美国总统。美国中西部的一些财阀和政客也在替他策划。
    在资本家的授意下，尼克松披上了“新尼克松”的装束。现在尼克松口口声声说什么“当我在国外旅行的时候……”，因为资本家认为扩大在国际事务方面的影响，是争取总统宝座的重要资本。一向具有种族优越感的尼克松，为了争取黑人的选票，现在充当了调查政府工程事务承包方面种族歧视情况的主持人。为了扩大对家庭妇女的影响，尼克松还允诺出任“发展经济、稳定物价委员会”的主席。当然，特别重要的是，尼克松现在公开鼓吹冷战，抵制国际局势的缓和，就成了美国垄断资本集团中最富扩张性的好战狂的势力所十分需要的。尼克松最近在洛杉矶大学发表的鼓吹“冷战”的演说就是一个赤裸裸的例子。
    从幕后到台前的洛克菲勒
    1955年底，洛克菲勒财团的政治明星纳尔逊·洛克菲勒辞去总统特别助理职务时，他得出了一条经验：“如果要使政府更加顺从洛克菲勒财团的意旨，必须真正地打入官场，不再以票友身份出现。”洛克菲勒回到纽约不到几个月，就在共和党的一次募捐会上向共和党纽约州委员会主席摩尔豪斯透露了他的这个意图。摩尔豪斯立即采取行动，任命洛克菲勒为研究纽约州宪法问题的州委员会主席，使他有机会了解纽约州的全貌并和人们接触。这是洛克菲勒从幕后走向台前、通过竞选纽约州长企图进一步跃登总统宝座的起点。
    1958年11月，洛克菲勒当选为纽约州长以后，不到几小时，新罕布什尔州就出现了“选洛克菲勒当总统”的呼声。接着，退休联邦法官勒法特就出面主持“选洛克菲勒当总统”的运动。
    洛克菲勒出没于华盛顿官场，已有二十年的历史。他先后担任过“美洲事务协调人”、专管拉丁美洲事务的助理国务卿、国际开发顾问局局长、联邦机构调整委员会主任、卫生教育福利部副部长、总统外交政策特别助理。他为美国政府拟订过许多反动的计划，上过多次反动的条陈。企图把世界置于洛克菲勒王朝统治之下的狂妄计划——1956年洛克菲勒给艾森豪威尔的秘密信，就是他的“杰作”。公开鼓吹核武器战争的报告——1958年1月的所谓“国际安全和军事情况报告”、加紧对外经济扩张的计划——1958年6月所谓“二十世纪的对外经济政策报告”，都是“洛克菲勒研究小组”的“贡献”。
    洛克菲勒财团的势力强大。它控制了资本主义世界石油开采量的五分之二，形成了以“新泽西美孚油公司”和“曼哈顿大通银行”为中心的巨大的石油帝国。它所掌握和控制的资本，据1955年统计，已高达六百一十四亿美元。洛克菲勒财团的资本早已伸入美国经济的许多部门。它直接、间接地参加了美国航空、电子、军事化学工业、火箭、导弹的生产。
    几十年以来，洛克菲勒财团的政治活动主要的是通过石油公司使用压力，把它的人员打进政府里去。第一次世界大战以后，美孚油公司开始了空前的海外扩张，洛克菲勒财团就插足于外交事务。第二次世界大战以后，增进美国的石油利益，竟成了美国国务院的首要工作，保卫石油利益，成了美国海外驻军的主要任务。前洛克菲勒基金会主席杜勒斯出任了国务卿，他的弟弟艾伦·杜勒斯曾任洛克菲勒家族的顾问，也担任了中央情报局局长的要职。洛克菲勒财团通过它在政治上的进展，增加了对价格和生产的控制，增强了竞争、兼并的力量，变成美国最有力的垄断组织。
    但是，随着世界局势的发展、社会主义国家经济的跃进、美国政治经济危机的深刻化，美国垄断集团中最富有侵略性和战争狂热的势力，不甘心自己的失败，积极图谋亲自掌握政权，以作垂死的挣扎。这就是洛克菲勒从幕后走向台前的原因。
    钩心斗角
    尽管洛克菲勒财团是美国实力最为雄厚的财团。可是美国今日仍然是几个大财团——摩根、杜邦、梅隆、“纽约第一花旗银行”、克利夫兰、芝加哥、“美洲银行”势均力敌的局面。这些财团也开展了所谓“企业到政治中去”的运动。梅隆财团的海湾石油公司早已发表了今后要“积极参与政治”的宣言，杜邦、福特汽车公司也有同样的表示。摩根财团的通用电气公司去年专门设立了一个“政府关系部”，来组织它的经理们“参与政治活动”。
    美国的各个垄断集团在对外侵略扩张的根本政策上，有着一致的一面，但是，由于美国政治经济危机的深刻化、垄断资本组织之间矛盾重重，各个垄断集团从不同的利益范围出发，在政策执行的方法和重点上，存在着日益扩大的分歧。
    二十五年以前，摩根财团的资产为洛克菲勒财团的两倍，而现在两者相等，可是洛克菲勒财团通过石油投资和对不发达国家无孔不入的掠夺，利润激增，它的势力的增长大大地超过了摩根财团，它对政府的影响也远比摩根财团为大。
    在过去，美国的历届总统，像格兰特、克利夫兰、老罗斯福、威尔逊等人都是由摩根集团挑选的。直到最近一些年以来，洛克菲勒财团在挑选美国总统一事上，才比摩根财团拥有更大的发言权。
    摩根财团不甘受洛克菲勒财团的排挤，在经济上开始了大规模的反扑。今年年初，摩根财团所属的两大公司进行合并以及摩根所属美国电讯公司增加股票发行额扩充势力，就是针对洛克菲勒财团的战略行动。
    美国中西部等财团，或以国内市场为主、或以经营民用工业为主，它们反对无限制地增加军费，它们担心财政赤字的激增会导致经济破产。这些财团与主张疯狂扩军备战、加紧向外经济扩张、以延缓和转嫁经济危机的洛克菲勒等财团，也存在着分歧。
    现在，洛克菲勒已经全力投入竞选运动。可是他一直不肯公开宣布参加竞选。11月1日的“纽约时报杂志”解释了这是什么原故。这家美国杂志说：
    “洛克菲勒州长关于他不是候选人的声明，应作不同的解释。他的意思是说：‘除非我完全相信自己有把握在竞选中打败尼克松，否则我不愿意把自己放在一个容易受人攻击的地位’”。“一个州长宣布他是总统候选人，就会引起政敌的攻击，说他想白宫入了迷，损害了州的利益。”
    但是，美国“时代”周刊却透露了洛克菲勒的急不可耐。它说，在9月中旬举行的洛克菲勒竞选策略会议上，洛克菲勒财团的这位政治明星大声呐喊：“他妈的！让我们动手干吧！我要干下去。至于别人的推测，那又有什么关系呢？反正干与不干，人家都要推测一番的。”
    现在，究竟鹿死谁手，判断尚早。但不管前途如何，洛克菲勒的竞选，说明了亿万富翁用“民主”外衣来遮掩自己的幕后统治这个方式，已越来越不能适应垂危的迫切形势了。
