    Beijing
    The call of the National Heroes' Conference has inspired millions of workers in the capital. A new upsurge of socialist labor emulation, comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward, is taking shape among the city's workers.
    The city's metallurgical, mechanical and electrical, and light industries are further formulating plans, establishing advanced experience promotion teams, conducting advanced technology performances on a wide scale, and systematically and on a larger scale disseminating the advanced experiences of representatives from various places and the advanced experiences of their own factories and cities to the vast number of workers. The mechanical and electrical system is organizing forces to appraise and map more than forty kinds of advanced cutting tools left by representatives from various places and created in the city, in order to promote them universally throughout the city. The textile system has already sorted out the advanced experiences from all over the country according to the type of work, and held training courses to promote these experiences. Many advanced experiences have already blossomed and borne fruit. After learning the fast steelmaking method of the Dalian Steel Plant, workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company reduced the smelting time of each furnace of steel from 241 minutes to 216 minutes. After learning the "multi-pass welding" experience of Hua Yongquan, a representative from Shanghai, the welding efficiency of electric welders at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory quickly doubled.
    Workers on the city's transportation front have also taken active action. The advanced collective, Beijing Railway Station, held workers' congresses on the 9th and 10th to determine concrete measures to improve services for passengers and complete the annual task ahead of schedule.
