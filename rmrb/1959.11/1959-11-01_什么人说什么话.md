What Kind of Person Speaks What Kind of Words
陈涛

Reading the thoughts of the residents of the Happiness Building, I was deeply moved and it also aroused many of my own thoughts.

Truly, "what kind of person sings what kind of song, what class speaks what kind of words." Domestic and foreign reactionaries and right-leaning opportunists have been vigorously attacking the Great Leap Forward since last year, while the working people are singing songs of happiness with full enthusiasm!

Compared with the many brilliant achievements of the Great Leap Forward, building new housing can be considered a small matter. But even this small matter, when compared, is so clear.

In the old society, housing was a major problem. Many people had tasted the suffering of having no house to live in, high rents, and forced evictions. Our great poet Du Fu once sighed, "Oh, to have ten thousand houses, to shelter all the poor scholars in the world and make them rejoice!" However, the poet's ideal was not realized for thousands of years. Only after the founding of the great People's Republic of China has it truly become possible for everyone to have a house to live in, and for everyone to rejoice.

The people living in the Happiness Building all have a comfortable home where they can work, study, and live in peace. But people's thoughts, people's horizons, are not limited to this small home. They are much broader, closely linked to the construction of the motherland and the revolutionary cause of hundreds of millions of people.

Take the issue of moving, for example. During the Kuomintang rule, moving was a worrying matter. People had no houses of their own and were forced to move because they couldn't afford the rent; if they had houses, they were requisitioned by the puppet government. The so-called "moving" meant losing one's home. How different the situation is now! Just look at the conversations of the residents of the Happiness Building, don't they vividly and specifically illustrate many issues?

Because of the need to build the new Beijing Railway Station and the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square, residents living there needed to be relocated. What was the residents' reaction? Housewife Jiang Huizhen said, "You don't know how considerate the government is. The residents' group leader showed us the new building and asked for our opinions on whether we were willing to move. I said that in order to support national construction, I have little ability and can't contribute much, but I will never delay moving. I'll move as soon as you say so..." This is how enthusiastically the residents responded to the call of the People's Government, without the slightest reluctance.

See, from this small matter of moving, it vividly reflects the close relationship between the People's Government and the masses: the masses love the People's Government and actively respond to the government's call; the government cares about the lives of the masses in every way and is always thinking about the interests of the masses. How starkly this contrasts with the situation in the old society!

More importantly, from the conversations of the residents of the Happiness Building, we can see the tremendous increase in people's political awareness and the vigorous upsurge of revolutionary enthusiasm over the past ten years. People are not concerned about trivial matters or mere economic interests. They have broad horizons and lofty goals, care about politics, care about our entire national construction, spare no effort to contribute their share to the magnificent socialist construction, rejoice in every great achievement we have made in our progress, and are proud to be citizens of New China. This kind of thought and feeling is precisely the thought and feeling of our 650 million people, and it inspires us to keep moving forward.

The thoughts and feelings of right-leaning opportunists are very different. They make sarcastic remarks from the sidelines, spouting nonsense and slandering many of our new constructions as "draining the people and wasting money." Doesn't this just prove where they stand and what kind of stuff they are made of?

The feelings of the residents of the Happiness Building are truly a song of happiness, singing the wise leadership of the Party and the government, singing the new construction, and singing the happy life.

Now our country is like a Happiness Building, and 650 million residents are singing songs of happiness, marching forward by leaps and bounds towards an even happier and more fulfilling life. If right-leaning opportunists try to hold us back, they will only stumble themselves.

    什么人说什么话
    陈涛
    读了幸福大楼居民们的感想，深受感动，也引起了我许多感想。
    真是“什么人唱什么歌，什么阶级说什么话。”国内外反动分子和右倾机会主义分子大肆攻击去年以来的大跃进，而劳动人民却是用满腔热情高唱着幸福的歌！
    同大跃进里的许多辉煌成就相比，盖新住宅也可以说是小事。但就是这件小事，对照起来，却是那么鲜明。
    在旧社会住房子是个大问题，许多人尝够了没房住、房租贵和强迫搬家的苦恼。我国伟大的诗人杜甫就曾经慨叹过：“安得广厦千万间，大庇天下寒士俱欢颜”。然而诗人的理想，千百年都没有能实现，只有在伟大的中华人民共和国成立以后，才真正地做到了人人有房住，个个俱欢颜。
    住在幸福大楼里的人们，都有了一个舒适的家，可以在这儿安静地工作、学习和生活。可是人们的思想，人们的视野并不局限在这个小小的家里，它要更宽阔得多，它紧密地和祖国的建设，和亿万人民的革命事业联系在一起。
    就以搬家问题为例。在国民党统治时代，搬家是一件伤脑筋的事，自己没有房，因为缴不起房租，被强迫搬家；自己有房，被伪政府征用，所谓“搬家”就是失去了家。而现在情况又是多么不同！请看幸福大楼居民们的谈话，不是生动而又具体地说明了许多问题么？
    因为要修北京新车站和天安门人民大会堂，需要动员住在那儿的居民迁移到别处去。居民们的反应怎样呢？家庭妇女姜慧贞说：“你不知道政府照顾得有多周到。居民小组长领我们看了新大楼，还征求我们意见愿不愿搬。我说为了支援国家建设，我能力低，出不了什么力，搬家事决不延迟，说搬就搬……”居民们就是这样热烈地响应人民政府的号召，没有一丝一毫勉强。
    看吧，就是从搬家这件小事里，多么生动地反映了人民政府和群众亲密无间的关系：群众热爱人民政府，积极响应政府的号召；政府处处关心群众的生活，无时无刻不在为群众的利益着想。这和在旧社会的情况比较起来，又是一个多么鲜明的对照！
    而更重要的是，从幸福大楼居民的谈话里，可以看出十年来人们政治觉悟的极大提高，和革命热情的蓬勃高涨。人们所关心的不是身边琐事和什么单纯的经济利益，他们眼界宽阔，目标远大，关心政治，关心我们整个的国家建设，为在宏伟的社会主义建设中贡献自己一分力量而奋不顾身，为我们前进中所取得的每一个巨大成绩而欢欣鼓舞，为能作为新中国的一个公民而自豪。这种思想感情，正是我们六亿五千万人民的思想感情，它激励着我们不断前进。
    右倾机会主义分子的思想感情却大不相同，他们在一旁冷言冷语，大放厥词，诬蔑我们的许多新建设是“劳民伤财”，这不恰好证明了他们是站在什么立场，是哪一路的货色么？
    幸福大楼居民们的感想，实在是一首幸福的歌，它歌唱党和政府英明的领导，歌唱新的建设，歌唱幸福的生活。
    现在我们的国家就好比一幢幸福大楼，六亿五千万居民正高唱着幸福之歌，大踏步向着更加幸福美满的生活前进，右倾机会主义分子要来拉后腿，那只会使自己跌跤的。
