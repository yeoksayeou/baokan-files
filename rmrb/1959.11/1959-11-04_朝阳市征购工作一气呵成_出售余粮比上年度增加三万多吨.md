Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st - Chaoyang City, Liaoning Province (including its five counties and one autonomous county), strengthened Party leadership and launched a vigorous mass movement, completing this year's grain procurement task ahead of schedule by one month and five days. The grain sold to the state by the communes increased by 36,685 tons compared to last year; the grain quality was mostly first and second grade. The rations for commune members, etc., were also reasonably arranged.

This year, the people's communes in Chaoyang City overcame severe natural disasters such as drought and flooding, enabling grain crops to achieve an all-round bumper harvest. Encouraged by the bumper harvest and the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the commune members were very enthusiastic about selling grain. In order to ensure the rapid completion of the grain procurement task, the Chaoyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China deployed the purchase of grain and other agricultural and sideline products during the autumn harvest. According to the instructions of the Municipal Committee, the Party committees at all levels strengthened their leadership over the procurement work, launched a vigorous mass movement, and organized several climaxes of concentrated grain sales, resolutely ensuring that the procurement work was completed in one go, without leaving any unfinished business. The grain departments adapted to the situation of the vigorous mass movement, set up many temporary purchasing stations, trained more than 700 quality inspection personnel, and overcame the difficulties of insufficient storage equipment by tapping potential, carrying out technical innovations, and using substitutes. With the vigorous support of the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in various places, they ensured the completion of the purchasing task on time, in quantity, and in quality.

    朝阳市征购工作一气呵成
    出售余粮比上年度增加三万多吨
    新华社沈阳1日电　辽宁省朝阳市（包括所属五县、一自治县）加强党的领导，大搞群众运动，提前一个月零五天超额完成了今年的粮食征购任务。各公社卖给国家的粮食，比上年度增加三万六千六百八十五吨；粮食质量绝大部分是一、二等好粮。社员们的口粮等，也得到了合理安排。
    今年，朝阳市各人民公社战胜了旱、涝等严重自然灾害，使粮食作物获得了全面丰收。公社社员们在丰收和党的八届八中全会鼓舞下，售粮热情很高。中共朝阳市委为了保证迅速完成征购粮任务，在秋收期间就布置了粮食和其他农副产品的收购工作。各级党委根据市委的指示，加强了对征购工作的领导，大搞群众运动，组织几次突击交售粮食的高潮，坚决作到征购工作一气呵成，不留尾巴。粮食部门适应大搞群众运动的形势，增设了许多临时收购站，培养了七百多名验质人员，并且通过挖掘潜力、大搞技术革新、采用代用品等办法，克服了保管器材不足的困难，加以各地基层供销合作社的大力支援，因此，保证按时、按量、按质地完成了收购任务。
