Xinhua News Agency, November 4th. More than 10,000 spectators in the capital braved the rain today at the Xian Nong Tan Stadium to watch the first friendly match of the Swedish "Djurgården" football team's visit to China, against the Tianjin football team. As a result, the two teams fought fiercely for ninety minutes and tied at one to one.

    The Tianjin team played actively today and dominated the entire game with 70% of the attacks, shooting a total of 24 times (the visiting team had a total of 9 shots). In the first half, at nineteen minutes, left winger Sun Yuanyun suddenly shot while dribbling the ball, scoring a goal and taking the lead. However, with only one minute left in the game, the visiting team took advantage of a "corner kick" opportunity to equalize, resulting in a tie.

    The visiting team will also play a friendly match with the Beijing football team in Beijing tomorrow.

    瑞典“尤哥登”足球队同天津队踢平
    据新华社4日讯　首都一万多名观众今天冒雨在先农坛体育场观看了瑞典“尤哥登”足球队同天津足球队举行的访华第一场友谊比赛。结果，两队经过九十分钟激战以一比一踢成平局。
    天津队今天踢得积极主动，全场占有七成攻势，共射门二十四次（客队共九次），上半场十九分钟时就由左边锋孙元云在带球跑动中突然射门，命中一球领先。但到球赛还剩最后一分钟时，被客队利用发“角球”的机会扳回一球，造成平局。
    客队明天还将在北京同北京足球队举行友谊比赛。
