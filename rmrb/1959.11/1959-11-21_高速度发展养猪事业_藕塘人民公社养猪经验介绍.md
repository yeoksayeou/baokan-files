High-Speed Development of Pig Raising
——Introduction to the Pig Raising Experience of the Outang People's Commune
Chen Liyan, Liao Qi

The Outang People's Commune in Dingyuan County, Anhui Province, has many hills and little fertilizer, resulting in low yields. After communization in 1958, the commune widely mobilized the masses to raise pigs, which initially changed the low-yield situation. From January to October this year, the commune raised more than 26,000 pigs (of which collectively raised pigs accounted for 58% of the total), averaging 6.5 pigs per household and 1.5 pigs per person. With more pigs and sufficient fertilizer, the per-mu yield of grain this year increased from 260 jin in 1957 to 505 jin. The income of commune members also increased by 121.8%.

　　To Increase Production, Raise Pigs and Fertilize the Land

In 1956, some commune members raised the issue of raising pigs. But some people did not agree. They said, "We are currently engaged in grain production, where do we have the energy to raise pigs?" It wasn't until last year that everyone's understanding of this issue became clear. The matter started with two production teams in the Tao'an Brigade: the Ran Zhou Production Team and the Wang Nian Production Team. The two teams are adjacent to each other, with roughly the same soil and water conservancy conditions. In 1956, when it was a higher-level agricultural cooperative, the Ran Zhou Production Team received a bonus for exceeding production targets, while the Wang Nian Production Team experienced a reduction in production. In 1957, the Ran Zhou Production Team continued to leap forward, with a per-mu yield of grain reaching 510 jin, while the Wang Nian Production Team's per-mu yield was only 300 jin. What was the reason for this? After comparing cattle power, labor, effort, and fertilizer, the Wang Nian Production Team realized that the Ran Zhou team raised more pigs and accumulated more fertilizer. The Ran Zhou Production Team raised 312 pigs, and each mu was fertilized with more than 50 dan of fertilizer each year, of which pig manure accounted for 40%. The Wang Nian Production Team, with 194 households, only raised 52 pigs, and each mu was fertilized with less than 19 dan. Thus, everyone reached a conclusion: "To increase production, raise pigs and fertilize the land." On an evening in July 1958, the team cadres convened a general meeting of all commune members and proposed building a pig farm to raise more pigs. The commune members unanimously supported this. Early the next morning, everyone started working. More than 60 commune members went out together, some building walls and some building pigsties. In less than half a day, the pig farm was built. Commune members sold more than 40 old sows, more than 30 pig troughs, and more than 300 dan of feed to the team at a discounted price. The commune Party committee believed that the team had great enthusiasm and was on the right path, so it held an on-site meeting here. From then on, the commune's pig raising business developed rapidly. Now, the Wang Nian Production Team has raised 537 pigs, and the amount of fertilizer applied this year has also increased greatly compared to previous years. Thanks to sufficient fertilizer, despite a hundred-day drought this year, the per-mu yield still increased by 66% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958.

　　Vigorously Develop Collective Breeding

Based on the pig raising development of the Wang Nian Production Team and the Ran Zhou Production Team over the years, the Outang Commune came to the conclusion that sows must be raised collectively to ensure the rapid development of pig raising. In 1954, 66 households in the Ran Zhou Production Team raised 161 pigs. In 1955, 74 households raised 183 pigs. In 1956, 97 households raised 240 pigs. In 1957, 112 households raised 312 pigs. Even in 1958, it only developed to 125 households raising 430 pigs (of which 90 were collectively raised). The number of old sows only increased from the original 10 to 13 last year. In short, the rate of pig increase was very slow. This was mainly because of the emphasis on private pig raising by commune members. Commune members were unwilling to raise more sows, believing that old sows were worthless and troublesome to raise, so the piglets born were all castrated. The Outang Commune summarized this experience and decided to vigorously promote collective breeding while also encouraging private breeding; sows would be valued and belong to the commune to control the source of pigs and rapidly develop pig production. In this way, the commune's collective pig raising business developed rapidly, with the number of sows increasing rapidly from more than 200 in 1957 to the current 3,020, and the reproduction rate increasing by an average of double that of 1957.

On the one hand, the commune actively developed collective breeding, and on the other hand, it also mobilized commune members to raise pigs privately, lending a portion of the piglets raised to commune members to raise themselves. From January to October this year, the commune lent a total of 7,500 piglets to commune members for self-raising. To solve the problem of pigsty difficulties for commune members raising pigs, the teams also established construction teams to help each household build pigsties, with work points resolved by the team. In addition, a certain amount of feed land was allocated to commune members, which greatly increased the enthusiasm for private pig raising. In just ten months this year, the commune's pig raising has developed to 26,049 heads, an increase of more than three times compared to 1957 before the great development.

　　Pigs Can Be Raised Without Grain

After the great development of the pig raising business, feed was indeed a problem, especially the shortage of concentrated feed. What to do? The commune decided to hand it over to the masses for discussion and let everyone come up with solutions. After the issue was raised, different opinions emerged among the masses. Some said, "Pigs cannot be raised without grain." Some advocated that the commune supply feed. But the vast majority of people said, "More pigs require more feed, and everyone who raises them must solve the problem together. Grain is the staple food for people, and pigs should be mainly fed with coarse feed." Ma Qigui, a breeder at the Zhuxiang Pig Farm, advocated self-sufficiency in feed and planted five mu of corn. His actions motivated everyone. Thus, men, women, old and young, everyone took action and found 83 sources of feed, opening up avenues for planting, collecting, fishing, making, and storing, and storing a large amount of coarse feed and substitute concentrated feed, solving the problem of insufficient feed.

Thanks to relying on the masses to solve the feed problem, the Outang Commune not only did not use grain to raise pigs this year, but also has a current balance of more than 2 million jin of coarse feed and 840,000 jin of concentrated feed. Now the commune has also planted more than 1,000 mu of lettuce, radishes, and other winter feed, and can also collect and store broken bean leaves, radishes, winter duckweed, and other coarse feed within the year. This feed can already last until the wheat harvest next year.

The enthusiasm of the commune members promoted the great development of pig production, and the result of the great development of pig production encouraged everyone's enthusiasm. Now all the commune members have made plans for pig raising in 1960 and are currently doing various preparatory work.

    高速度发展养猪事业
    ——藕塘人民公社养猪经验介绍
    陈立言　廖奇
    安徽定远县藕塘公社山岗地多，肥料少，产量较低；1958年公社化后，公社广泛发动群众养猪，这才初步改变了低产面貌。今年1月到10月，全社共养生猪二万六千多头（其中公养占总数58％），平均每户六点五头，平均每人一点五头。猪多肥足，今年粮食亩产量由1957年的二百六十斤提高到五百零五斤。社员收入也增加了121.8％。
      要想增产，养猪肥田
    1956年，就有些社员提出养猪的问题。但有些人不大同意。他们说：“现在正搞粮食生产，哪有精力养猪。”一直到去年，大家对这个问题的认识才明确起来。事情是从陶庵大队的两个生产队引起的。这两个队，一个是冉周生产队，一个是王碾生产队。二个队土地相连，土质、水利大致相同。1956年高级社时，冉周生产队得超产奖，而王碾生产队却减了产。1957年，冉周生产队继续跃进，粮食亩产量达五百一十斤，而王碾生产队亩产量只有三百斤。这是什么原因呢？王碾生产队经过比牛力、比劳力、比功夫、比肥料，一样一样排队算账，才发现冉周队猪比他们养得多，肥料比他们积得多。冉周生产队养猪三百一十二头，每年每亩施肥都在五十担以上，其中猪肥占40％。王碾生产队一百九十四户，只养猪五十二头，每亩施肥不到十九担。这样大家得出一条结论：“要想增产，养猪肥田”。在1958年7月的一个晚上，队里干部召开了全体社员大会，提出了办猪场多养猪，社员一致拥护。第二天一早大家就干开了，六十多个社员一齐出动，扎墙的扎墙，搞猪圈的搞猪圈，不到半天时间，便把猪场建成了。社员折价卖给队里四十多头老母猪，三十多个猪槽，三百多担饲料。公社党委认为这个队的干劲很大，道路走的对，就在这里召开现场会议。从这时起，全社的养猪事业便迅速地发展起来。现在王碾生产队已养猪五百三十七头，今年施肥量也比往年大大增加了。由于肥料足，今年虽遇百日大旱，亩产仍比大跃进的1958年增长了66％。
      大力发展集体饲养
    根据王碾生产队和冉周生产队历年来养猪发展情况，藕塘公社得出一个结论：母猪必须集体饲养，才能保证养猪事业的迅速发展。冉周生产队1954年有六十六户养猪一百六十一头，1955年有七十四户养猪一百八十三头，1956年九十七户养猪二百四十头，1957年一百一十二户养猪三百一十二头，一直到1958年也不过发展到一百二十五户养猪四百三十头（其中集体喂养九十头）。老母猪只由原来的十头，去年增加到十三头，一句话，猪增加的速度是很慢的。主要是因为偏重社员私人养猪，社员们不愿多养母猪，认为老母猪不值钱，养起来又烦神，所以生下来的小母猪都阉割了。藕塘公社总结出这个经验，决定大力提倡集体饲养，同时也鼓励私人饲养；母猪折价归社，以便掌握猪源，迅速发展生猪。就这样，全社的集体养猪事业发展很快，母猪由1957年的二百多头迅速增长到现在的三千零二十头，繁殖率平均比1957年提高一倍。
    公社一方面积极发展集体饲养，另一方面也发动社员私养，把繁殖的仔猪贷一部分给社员饲养。把今年1月到10月，全社共贷给社员自养的小猪共七千五百头。为了解决社员养猪的猪圈困难，各队还成立了基建队，帮助各户盖猪圈，工分由队里解决。此外还划给一定的饲料地给社员，这就大大提高了私人养猪的积极性。今年仅十个月时间，全社养猪已发展到二万六千零四十九头，比大发展前的1957年增加三倍以上。
    养猪可以不用粮
    养猪事业大发展以后，饲料确实是一个问题，特别是精饲料更加缺乏。怎么办呢？公社决定交给群众讨论，让大家想办法。问题提出以后，群众中又出现了不同意见，有的说：“没有粮食就不能养猪。”有的主张由社里供应饲料。但是绝大多数人说：“猪多要的饲料多，大家养就得大家解决，粮食是人的主粮，猪应该以粗饲料为主。”朱巷猪场饲养员马其贵主张饲料自给，他种了五亩玉米。他的行动带动了大家。于是男女老少，人人动手，找出了八十三种饲料来源，开辟了种、采、捞、制、贮等项门路，收贮了大量的粗饲料和代精饲料，解决了饲料不足的困难。
    由于依靠群众解决饲料，藕塘公社今年不仅没有用粮食养猪，而且现在结存粗饲料二百多万斤，精饲料八十四万斤。现在公社又种了千多亩生菜、萝卜等过冬饲料，年内还可收贮碎豆叶子、萝卜、冬浮萍等粗饲料。这些饲料已经可以吃到明年麦收。
    社员的干劲促进了养猪生产大发展，养猪生产大发展的结果，又鼓舞了大家的干劲。现在全社社员已作好1960年养猪的规划，目前正在做各项准备工作。
