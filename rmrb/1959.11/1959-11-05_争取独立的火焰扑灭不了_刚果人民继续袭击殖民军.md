Xinhua News Agency, November 4th, Stanleyville Dispatch: In the Stanleyville region of the Belgian Congo, angry Africans attacked some plantations and houses of the colonizers on the 3rd. There are reports that Congolese people attacked police patrols in many places.

Large numbers of colonial troops and police are patrolling the area. On the 3rd, the Belgian "security forces" launched so-called "sweeps" against Africans in Mangobo. More than one hundred Africans were arrested on the highway from Stanleyville to Abala. On the 2nd, colonial police searched the secretariat of the Congolese National Movement Party and looted some documents.

According to a dispatch from Brussels, the Belgian Parliament held an emergency meeting on the Stanleyville incident. The Belgian Minister for the Congo and Ruanda-Urundi, De Schrijver, tried his best to defend the bloody suppression by the colonizers in his speech to Parliament. He stated that he would insist on implementing the deceptive plan of so-called "independence in stages" for the Congo, which is widely opposed by the Congolese people. He announced that the Belgian government had decided to hold a so-called "round table conference" in the Congo from November 20 to 30 with "Congolese political leaders" to discuss this issue. He will personally preside over the meeting.

De Schrijver also put forward a deceptive plan in the economic field. He said that the Belgian government proposed to establish a "special aid fund" organization for the Congo in 1960, provide 1 billion Belgian francs to establish a "Congo Development Association," and pass a law making the Congolese franc equivalent to the Belgian franc. The Belgian authorities are attempting to use these promises as bait to soften the Congolese people's struggle for immediate independence.

Xinhua News Agency, November 4th, TASS Paris, November 3rd: The French newspaper "Le Monde," in its commentary on the recent events in the Belgian Congo, said that the situation in this Belgian colony continues to deteriorate. The local residents of the Congo firmly reject the Belgian government's statement on "gradual independence" for the Congo, because the real purpose of this statement is to delay the independence of the Congo.

The newspaper wrote that Africans believe that the Belgian government is trying to force them to accept a four-year transition period, during which the Belgian government is preparing to support local people who betray the interests of the people to take power.

"Le Monde" said that a movement for independence is now being carried out throughout the Belgian Congo. The recent arrest of the famous political activist Lumumba has aroused strong resistance from the Congolese residents. Mass demonstrations and rallies have been held in many cities, demanding the release of the arrested patriots.

    争取独立的火焰扑灭不了
    刚果人民继续袭击殖民军
    新华社4日讯　斯坦利维尔消息：在比属刚果斯坦利维尔地区，愤怒的非洲人3日袭击了殖民者的一些种植园和房屋。有消息说，许多地方发生刚果人袭击警察巡逻队的事件。
    大批殖民军警在那个地区巡逻。比利时的“治安部队”3日在芒果波对非洲人展开了所谓“扫荡”行为。在斯坦利维尔到阿巴拉的公路上，就有一百多名非洲人被逮捕。殖民警察在2日搜查了刚果民族运动党书记处的所在地，并且劫走了一些文件。
    另据来自布鲁塞尔的消息说，比利时议会为斯坦利维尔事件召开了紧急会议。比利时刚果和卢安达—乌隆迪大臣德舒里弗在议会的发言中竭力为殖民者的血腥镇压辩护。他表示将坚持执行遭到刚果人民广泛反对的所谓让刚果“分阶段独立”的欺骗性计划。他宣布，比利时政府决定在11月20日到30日在刚果同“刚果的政治领袖”举行所谓“圆桌会议”来讨论这方面的问题。他将亲自去主持这个会议。
    德舒里弗又提出了一项在经济方面的欺骗性计划，他说，比利时政府建议在1960年建立一个对刚果的“特别援助基金”组织、提供十亿比利时法郎来建立一个“刚果发展协会”以及通过一项使刚果法郎同比利时法郎等值的法律。比利时当局企图用这些诺言作为诱饵，来软化刚果人民要求立即独立的斗争。
    据新华社4日讯　塔斯社巴黎3日讯：法国“世界报”在评论比属刚果最近的事件时说，比利时这个殖民地的局势在继续恶化。刚果的当地居民坚决拒绝比利时政府关于刚果“逐步独立”的声明，因为这个声明的真正目的是拖延让刚果独立。
    这家报纸写道，非洲人认为，比利时政府企图迫使他们接受四年的过渡时期，在这段时期内，比利时政府准备扶植当地出卖人民利益的人执政。
    “世界报”说，现在比属刚果各地都在开展争取独立运动，不久以前逮捕著名的政治活动家卢蒙巴引起了刚果居民强烈的反抗。许多城市纷纷举行群众性的示威和群众大会，要求释放被捕的爱国人士。
