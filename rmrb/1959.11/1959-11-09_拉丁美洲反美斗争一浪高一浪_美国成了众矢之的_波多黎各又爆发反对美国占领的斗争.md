Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: According to Xinhua News Agency, recently, the struggle of Latin America against American interference, aggression, and plunder has continued to develop, causing serious unease among the American ruling clique.

According to a dispatch from San Juan, on the evening of the 4th, a struggle against American occupation took place in Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico. Local people damaged American radio lines, telegraph stations, and telephones, tore up American flags, and distributed leaflets supporting the imprisoned National Party Chairman and leader of the Puerto Rican independence movement, Pedro Albizu Campos. At the same time, the military warehouse of the Puerto Rican National Guard was also attacked.

According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington: After U.S. State Department spokesman White denied on the 6th that the U.S. authorities in the Panama Canal Zone had torn down the Panamanian flag raised by Panamanian students, the Panamanian government submitted a new note to the United States, pointing out that American journalists had also confirmed the facts denied by the U.S. State Department. Panama's Chargé d'Affaires to the United States, Morgan Morales, reiterated this point in a statement.

The Cuban government continues to take over American companies and large estates. At the same time, people throughout Cuba are mobilizing to participate in military training and make donations to purchase weapons in order to strengthen national defense and prepare to counter foreign aggression.

The Cuban struggle against American interference continues to receive support from the people of Latin American countries. In Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, more than two hundred young people held a demonstration on the evening of the 6th. The procession passed through the downtown area of the capital, chanting slogans such as "Down with America" and "Long Live Cuba." When the procession gathered opposite the American Embassy, the police dispersed the demonstrators. The nationalist student movement in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, also recently issued a declaration supporting the Cuban people's struggle against American interference. The declaration pointed out that the students belonging to this organization adopted such a position because "they noticed that the people of Latin American countries are all fighting for the same cause, and the goals they are striving to achieve are also the same, namely economic and political independence in the Western Hemisphere."

On November 5th, the American "New York Times" published an article by Tad Szulc from Washington entitled "The United States Is Again the Target of Public Criticism," lamenting that "a new wave of extreme nationalism directed at the United States seems to be rising in Latin America." The article cited facts, saying that the Cuban struggle against American interference continues, the rest of Latin America is reacting strongly to Cuba's anti-American struggle, Panama has seen another outbreak of demonstrations against the American occupation of the Panama Canal Zone, Brazil is taking over some American enterprises, and Venezuela is also forcing the United States to withdraw funds... These events "have deepened the difficult relationship between the United States and Latin America." The article believes that "what is happening before our eyes seems to be much more profound than in the past, and therefore, a dangerous thing." The article said that policymakers in Washington are "increasingly uneasy" about this.

The London "Times" published an editorial on November 5th entitled "Sharp-Toothed Saw," believing that the anti-American demonstrations in Panama and the incident of Panamanian students rushing into the Canal Zone and planting the Panamanian flag "marks a stronger hatred for what many Latin Americans consider to be America's outdated policies towards the region." On the same day, the "Scotsman" also published an editorial entitled "Discontented Panama," saying that "disturbances in Central American countries now frequently break out into the news and cause wider unease." The editorial said that Latin America "every small disturbance reminds the United States that its southern entrance is not safe, and there is no easy way to better tidy up the troublesome Caribbean region."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 6th November: In order to strengthen national defense, the Cuban people are mobilizing to participate in military training and make donations to purchase weapons.

University students in Havana have begun military training for the "José Antonio Echeverría Youth Detachment". In Santiago, local university students have started enlisting in their respective student associations for the same purpose. In addition, many mass organizations have expressed their firm determination to organize militias and demanded that the government immediately organize militias.

The movement to raise funds to purchase aircraft and other national defense equipment is rapidly unfolding across the country. Donation committees have been established in cities such as Cotorro, Trinidad, and Agabama. Similar fundraising organizations have also been established in Bayamo, Artemisa, and Manzanillo, with the slogan of donating an aircraft to the revolutionary air force. Young people with donation cans are frequently seen on the streets of Havana and other inland cities, asking for donations. Employees of the Cuban Electric Company have placed money boxes in their workplaces.

In addition, the movement to donate one day's wages continues to unfold among workers. According to today's news, workers at five sugar mills donated 14,225 pesos. In Oriente Province, November 1st has been designated as the donation day for the people to defend national sovereignty. Tobacco workers in Cabayguan in this province worked on Sunday, a day of rest, and donated their income for the day. Workers at the "United Automobile Company" in Havana decided to hold an event on the 9th to donate airplanes and weapons for Cuba.

The donation movement is also enthusiastically unfolding in rural areas. Farmers have donated hundreds of kilograms of corn, poultry, pigs, and other produce from the land, which is now guaranteed by land reform.

The donation movement is also unfolding among business people. Major commercial firms donated large sums of money at a meeting held at the office of the Cuban National Chamber of Commerce. It was also decided to establish a committee responsible for conducting trade activities to support Cuban national defense. Its main activity is to raise funds among merchants.

    拉丁美洲反美斗争一浪高一浪
    美国成了众矢之的
    波多黎各又爆发反对美国占领的斗争
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：最近以来，拉丁美洲反对美国干涉、侵略和掠夺的斗争，继续发展中，美国统治集团感到严重不安。
    据圣胡安消息，4日晚上在波多黎各的萨巴纳格兰德地方发生了反对美国占领的斗争。当地人民破坏了美国的电台线路、发报台、电话和撕毁了美国旗帜，并且散发了拥护被监禁的国民党主席和波多黎各独立运动领袖佩德罗·阿耳维苏·坎波斯的传单。同时，波多黎各国家警卫队的军用仓库也遭到了袭击。
    据合众国际社华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人怀特在6日否认美国驻巴拿马运河区当局曾撕下巴拿马学生升起的巴拿马国旗后，巴拿马政府向美国提交一份新的照会，指出美国记者也证实了美国国务院所否认的事实。巴拿马驻美代办摩根·莫拉莱斯发表谈话，重申了这一点。
    古巴政府继续接管美国公司和大庄园。同时，古巴各地人民，正在动员起来参加军事训练和进行购买武器的捐献工作，以加强国防力量，准备反击外国的侵略。
    古巴反对美国干涉的斗争，继续得到拉丁美洲各国人民的声援。阿根廷首都布宜诺斯艾利斯二百多名青年在6日晚上举行了示威游行，游行队伍经过首都的闹市，高呼“打倒美国”和“古巴万岁”等口号。当游行队伍聚集在美国大使馆对面时，警察部队驱散了示威的群众。巴西南里约格朗德州的民族主义学生运动最近也发表宣言，声援古巴人民反对美国干涉的斗争。宣言指出：属于这个组织的学生所以采取这样的立场，是因为“他们注意到：拉丁美洲各国人民都是为了同样的事业而进行斗争，他们争取达到的目标也是同样的，即西半球在经济和政治上的独立”。
    11月5日美国“纽约时报”刊登了塔德·苏耳克特发自华盛顿的一篇题为“美国又成了众矢之的”的文章，惊呼“针对美国的极端民族主义的新浪潮似乎在拉丁美洲高涨起来”。文章列举事实说，古巴反对美国干涉的斗争继续在进行，拉丁美洲其余地区对古巴的反美斗争反应强烈，巴拿马又爆发了反对美国占领巴拿马运河区的示威，巴西接管美国一些企业，委内瑞拉也在迫使美国撤回资金……，这些事件“加深了美国同拉丁美洲之间的困难关系。”文章认为，“眼前正在发生的事情似乎要比过去深刻得多，因此，也是危险的事情”。文章说，华盛顿的决策者对此“日益感到不安”。
    伦敦“泰晤士报”在11月5日发表题为“齿口锋利的锯齿”的社论，认为巴拿马发生的反美示威和巴拿马学生冲进运河区插上巴拿马国旗的事件，“标志着人们对于被许多拉丁美洲人所认为的美国对该地区的过时政策的更加强烈的憎恨”。同一天，“苏格兰人报”也发表题为“不满的巴拿马”的社论说，“现在中美国家的骚乱经常爆发成新闻，并且引起了更广泛的不安”。社论说，拉丁美洲“每一件小小的骚乱都提醒美国，它的南部入口并不安全，也没有什么轻易的办法可以使它更好地整顿多事的加勒比地区”。
    新华社哈瓦那6日电　为加强国防力量，古巴人民正在动员起来参加军事训练和进行购买武器的捐献工作。
    哈瓦那大学生已经开始了“何塞·安东尼奥·埃切维里亚青年支队”的军事训练。在圣地亚哥，当地大学生为了同样的目的开始在他们各自的学生协会中应征兵役。另外，许多群众团体表示了要组织民兵的坚定的决心，并要求政府立即组织民兵。
    募集基金用来购买飞机及其他国防装备的运动在全国迅速展开。在科托罗、特立尼达和阿加巴马等城市已经成立了捐献委员会。在巴雅摩、阿尔特米萨和曼萨尼罗城也成立了相似的募捐组织，他们的口号是向革命空军捐献一架飞机。在哈瓦那和其他内地城市的街道上经常可以看到进行募捐的青年，他们带着钱罐，要求捐款。古巴电力公司的职员在工作的地方放了积钱罐。
    此外，捐献一天工资的运动在工人中继续展开。据今天的消息，五个糖厂的工人就捐献了一万四千二百二十五比索。在奥连特省，11月1日已经被规定为人民保卫民族主权的捐献日。这个省的卡拜古安的选烟工人在星期日休息天从事劳动，并把当天的收入捐了出来。哈瓦那“联合汽车公司”工人决定在9日举行为古巴捐献飞机和武器的活动。
    捐献运动也在农村热烈展开。农民捐出了数以百公斤计的玉米、家禽、猪、以及土地上的其他生产品，这些土地现在得到了土地改革的保证。
    捐献运动也在商业界人士中展开。各重要商行在古巴全国商会的办公处举行的会议上，捐出了大量的金钱。会上还决定建立一个负责进行支持古巴国防的贸易活动的委员会。其主要活动是，在商人中间募集资金。
