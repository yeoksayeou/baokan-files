Having been established in 1898, the ancient Peking University has a history of sixty-one years, while the youngest department in the whole university, the Department of Radio Electronics, is only a little over ten months old. Under the leadership of the Party, the faculty, staff, and students of this department have displayed soaring enthusiasm and a spirit of daring to think and act, vigorously engaging in mass movements and fiercely attacking cutting-edge science. In just ten months, they have achieved great successes in teaching, scientific research, and cadre training.

In the early stages of the department's establishment, they encountered many difficulties in terms of both faculty and equipment. After extensive airing of views, debates, and big-character posters, they formulated a teaching plan that combined teaching, scientific research, and productive labor, clarifying the cadre training goals and the department's scientific development direction. Young teachers adopted methods such as collective lesson preparation, holding seminars, and scientific report meetings to leverage the collective's role, and they seized opportunities to learn from Soviet experts and from fraternal schools, scientific research institutions, and enterprises. In the past ten months, thirteen new specialized courses and seven experimental courses have been opened or are ready to be opened soon.

Due to the lack of teaching and scientific research equipment, teachers took their lab technicians and made their own equipment. In the past five months, they have self-made more than twenty types of various necessary instruments, totaling more than one hundred units, solving some of the needs for teaching and scientific research, and saving the state approximately 200,000 yuan. The scientific research work of the entire department is also developing at a high speed. On the one hand, they systematically arranged manpower to fill blank disciplines and strengthen weak links. On the other hand, they fiercely attacked cutting-edge technologies. Large-scale projects that have been completed or are basically completed, such as radio telescopes, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers, paramagnetic resonance spectrometers, ultra-high vacuum and field emission electron microscopes, etc., have all reached fairly good levels.

    建系十个月取得大成就
    古老的北京大学从1898年建校以来，已有六十一年的历史了，而全校最年轻的系——无线电电子学系年龄才不过十个多月。这个系的师生员工，在党的领导下发扬了冲天的干劲和敢想敢做的精神，大搞群众运动，猛攻尖端科学。短短十个月中，在教学、科学研究和干部培养方面，都取得了巨大成绩。
    建系初期，不论在师资和设备方面，都碰到了很多困难。他们经过大鸣大放大辩论，制定了教学、科学研究、生产劳动相结合的教学计划，明确干部培养目标和系的科学发展方向。青年教师们采取集体备课、开讨论班、举行科学报告会等发挥集体作用的方法，并争取机会向苏联专家学习，向兄弟学校、科学研究机关和企业部门学习，十个月来，已开出和准备就绪即将开出的新的专门化课程有十三门，实验课七门。
    教学和科学研究仪器设备缺乏，教师们就带着实验员自己动手做。近五个月来，已经自制了各种必需的仪器二十余类，共一百余台，解决了教学和科学研究的部分需要，为国家节约了约二十万元的资金。全系的科学研究工作，也在高速度地开展。他们一方面有计划地安排人力填补空白学科，加强薄弱环节，一方面猛攻尖端，已经完成或基本完成的大型工作如射电天文望远镜、核磁共振波谱仪、顺磁共振波谱仪、超高真空及场致发射式电子显微镜等等，都达到了相当良好的水平。
