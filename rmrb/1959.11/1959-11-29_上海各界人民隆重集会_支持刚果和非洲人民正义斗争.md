Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th - A grand meeting of one thousand people from all walks of life in Shanghai was held this afternoon, enthusiastically responding to the call of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council to hold "Congo Day" and "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day," resolutely supporting the just struggle of the Congolese and African people for national independence and against colonialism.

    Ba Jin, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and member of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council, delivered the opening speech at the meeting. He said: The heroic struggle of the Congolese people and the upsurge of the national independence movement of the African people are fiercely destroying the imperialist colonial system and accelerating the collapse of the colonial system, which has made a significant contribution to the cause of the world's people against imperialism and in defense of world peace. The flames of anger against colonialism have spread throughout the African continent, and victory will surely belong to the heroic Congolese and African people.

    Zhong Min, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, then spoke, saying: The people of Shanghai, like the people of the whole country, angrily and strongly condemn the crimes of the Belgian colonial rulers in massacring the Congolese people with the help of U.S. imperialism, resolutely support the struggle of the Congolese people for national independence, and resolutely demand that the Belgian colonialists immediately get out of the Congo, and imperialism must get out of Africa!

    Zhong Min then talked about the current international situation. He exposed the U.S. imperialist aggression activities and war preparation plots in various parts of the world with a large number of facts. He emphasized that U.S. imperialism is the common and most ferocious enemy of the national independence movement and the world peace and democracy movement in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the world. The U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war is the source of war threats and international tension. Recently, in the face of the world's people's powerful peace forces, the U.S. authorities have been forced to make some easing gestures, pretending to talk about peace, but in fact, they are trying to intensify the "Cold War," expand war preparations, and pursue a sinful policy of aggression and war throughout the world. It is worth emphasizing that U.S. imperialism and the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke reactionary government, ignoring the strong opposition of the vast majority of the Japanese people, have clamored to sign a new Japan-U.S. "security treaty" in mid-January next year, formally concluding an aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance. Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama openly clamored that the area covered by the new Japan-U.S. "security treaty" will be centered on Japan, including the area north of the Philippines, the coastal area of China, and the coastal border area of the Soviet Union. The aggressive conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries endangers the security of Japan itself and seriously threatens peace in the Far East and the world.

    Zhong Min said: U.S. imperialism has always been hostile to the Chinese people, and we warn the U.S. imperialists that all conspiracies against the Chinese people will suffer a more tragic and more complete failure than in the past! The Chinese people have always loved peace and resolutely defend peace in the Far East and the world; we have always deeply sympathized with and resolutely supported the just struggle of all countries to win and maintain national independence and oppose the aggressive forces headed by U.S. imperialism. We must further strengthen the unity of the socialist brother countries headed by the Soviet Union, and join hands more closely with all peace-loving people in the world to fight together to eliminate the threat of imperialist war and strive for lasting peace!

    Also speaking at the meeting today were Shen Han, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, Shen Cuizhen, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Women's Federation, and Luo Guanzong, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Youth Federation. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the just struggle of the workers, women, youth and all the people of Congo and all of Africa for independence and freedom.

    上海各界人民隆重集会
    支持刚果和非洲人民正义斗争
    新华社上海28日电　上海各界人民一千人今天下午隆重集会，热烈响应亚非人民团结理事会关于举行“刚果日”和“帝国主义滚出非洲日”的号召，坚决支持刚果和非洲人民争取民族独立、反对殖民主义的正义斗争。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会上海市分会副主席、亚非人民团结理事会理事巴金在大会上致开会词。他说：刚果人民的英勇斗争，非洲人民民族独立运动的高涨，正在猛烈地摧毁着帝国主义的殖民制度，加速着殖民体系的崩溃，这对全世界人民反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的事业有着重大的贡献。反对殖民主义的怒火，已经烧遍了整个非洲大陆，胜利一定属于英勇的刚果人民和非洲人民。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会上海市分会副主席钟民接着讲话，他说：上海人民和全国人民一样，愤怒地、严厉地谴责比利时殖民统治者在美国帝国主义帮助下屠杀刚果人民的罪行，坚决支持刚果人民争取民族独立的斗争，坚决要求比利时殖民者立即从刚果滚出去，帝国主义必须从非洲滚出去！
    钟民接着谈到了目前的国际形势。他以大量事实揭露了美帝国主义在世界各地的侵略活动和准备战争的阴谋。他着重指出，美帝国主义是非洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲和全世界民族独立运动和世界和平民主运动的共同的最凶恶的敌人。美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策是战争威胁和国际紧张局势的根源。最近时期，面对着世界人民强大的和平力量，美国当局被迫作出了某些缓和姿态，装模作样地侈谈和平，而事实上则竭力加剧“冷战”，扩大备战活动，在全世界推行着罪恶的侵略政策和战争政策。值得着重指出的是美帝国主义和日本岸信介反动政府，不顾广大日本人民的强烈反对，扬言要在明年一月中旬签订新的日美“安全条约”，正式缔结侵略性的日美军事同盟。日本外相藤山爱一郎公然叫嚷新的日美“安全条约”所包括的地区，将以日本为中心，包括菲律宾以北地区、中国沿海地区和苏联滨海的边疆地区等。美日反动派的侵略阴谋危害着日本本身的安全，也严重地威胁着远东和世界和平。
    钟民说：美帝国主义一贯敌视中国人民，我们警告美帝国主义者，反对中国人民的一切阴谋活动，必将遭受到比过去更加悲惨和更加彻底的失败！中国人民一向热爱和平，并坚决保卫远东及世界和平；我们一贯深切同情和坚决支持各国争取和维护民族独立、反对以美帝国主义为首的侵略势力的正义斗争。我们要进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义兄弟国家的团结，同世界上一切爱好和平的人民更紧密地携起手来，为消除帝国主义战争威胁和争取持久和平而共同奋斗！
    今天在大会上讲话的，还有上海市总工会副主席沈涵、上海市妇女联合会副主任沈粹缜、上海市青年联合会副主席罗冠宗等。他们一致表示坚决支持刚果和全非洲的工人、妇女、青年和全体人民争取独立自由的正义斗争。
