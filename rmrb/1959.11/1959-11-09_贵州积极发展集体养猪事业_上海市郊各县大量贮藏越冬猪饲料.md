Xinhua News Agency report:

    Guizhou Province is actively developing collective pig raising, with over 500 people's communes building pig farms and striving to achieve one pig per person next year. Suiyang County had already built more than 120 collective pigsties by September. Zunyi Prefecture has arranged 230,000 mu of land for pig feed bases.

    After Guizhou Province implemented the policy of emphasizing both public and private pig raising, the production of pigs developed rapidly. According to the Provincial Bureau of Statistics, by the end of September, the existing number of pigs in the province increased by 23% compared with the first half of the year, averaging two pigs per household. Zunyi Prefecture and the three counties of Hezhang, Shuicheng, and Weining have reached or exceeded the target set by the National Agricultural Development Program of 2.5 pigs per household. Some communes and management districts have achieved one pig per mu of land.

    The development of pig raising has brought many benefits to both national supply and commune production. In the first nine months of this year, the province supplied the state with more than 800,000 commercial fattened pigs. In Suiyang County, income from pigs alone accounted for 42% of the county's total income from agricultural and sideline industries. In the Lihua Commune's Longdong Management District in Dafang County, the realization of one pig per mu of land this year increased fertilization by more than 20% compared to previous years, promoting a bumper grain harvest.

    Currently, all counties are preparing to build one to ten state-run pig farms, and each commune is establishing pig farms with 500 to 10,000 pigs, requiring that the proportion of collectively raised pigs increase from the current 51% of the total number of pigs to around 70%.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 8th: The eleven counties in the suburbs of Shanghai and various communes recently conducted an in-depth inspection of suburban animal husbandry production, adopting a method of mutual aid and support between teams, communes, and counties from the bottom up. They successively inspected forty-eight production teams in twenty-five people's communes. This inspection enabled everyone to see the excellent situation and favorable conditions for developing non-staple food production in rural Shanghai. Many communes and production teams with better animal husbandry production have already achieved the plan of one pig per mu of land. Many communes and production teams expect to exceed this year's pig raising plan. Even some communes or production teams with relatively poor production have great potential. Although the pigs currently raised in Caohang Commune, Shanghai County, are not developing rapidly, this commune has kept many sows. As long as leadership is strengthened, the backward situation can be quickly changed and rapid development can be achieved.

    Through inspection, the current development of animal husbandry has been powerfully promoted. All counties and communes are actively building new pig sheds, vigorously storing green and coarse feed, and carrying out cold prevention work. From mid-July to the end of October, each commune in Fengxian County expanded and built more than 5,500 earthen pig sheds. To date, all counties have stored 12 million dan of feed, with Songjiang County alone storing 3 million dan. The Longxi Production Team of Meilong Commune and the Zhongxin and Minjian Production Teams of Caohang Commune in Shanghai County did not pay enough attention to pig raising in the past. After the inspection, the cadres of these teams decided to actively take measures to quickly change their backward situation in the short term.

    Counties and communes exchanged experiences with each other during this inspection. For example, after mutual inspection, representatives from Baoshan, Jiading, and Chongming counties believed that Jiading County did a better job in feeding management, cold protection, and silage feed, while Baoshan County did a better job in making use of local resources, relying on its own efforts, building earthen sheds on a large scale, and selecting good breeds. The representatives resolved to learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, and make common progress. Representatives from Fengxian County believed that the practice of the Shuguang Production Team of Xinjing Commune in Shanghai County of raising sows, piglets, and meat pigs separately was very good, and expressed their intention to seriously promote it upon their return.

    贵州积极发展集体养猪事业
    上海市郊各县大量贮藏越冬猪饲料
    据新华社讯　贵州省五百多个人民公社积极兴建养猪场，发展集体养猪事业，力争明年实现每人一头猪。绥阳县在9月份已修建了集体猪圈一百二十多幢。遵义专区安排了生猪饲料基地二十三万亩。
    贵州省贯彻了公养私养同时并举的方针后，生猪生产发展很快，据省统计局统计，到9月底，全省现有的存栏猪比上半年增长23％，平均每户达两头。遵义专区和赫章、水城、威宁等三个县，已经达到或超过全国农业发展纲要规定每户养猪二点五头的指标，部分公社和管理区已经做到一亩地有一头猪。
    发展养猪事业后，对国家供应和公社生产方面都带来很多好处。今年头九个月，全省各地为国家提供的商品肥猪即达八十多万头。绥阳县仅生猪一项收入就占全县农副业总收入42％。大方县理化公社龙洞管理区，今年实现每亩地一头猪，施肥比往年增加20％以上，促进了粮食丰产。
    现在，各县都在准备兴建一至十个国营养猪场，每个公社建立养猪五百至一万头的养猪场，要求集体养猪的比重由现在占存栏总数的51％发展到70％左右。
    新华社上海8日电　上海市郊十一个县和各个公社最近自下而上采取队与队、公社与公社、县与县对口的办法对郊区畜牧生产进行了一次深入的检查。先后检查了二十五个人民公社的四十八个生产队。这次检查，使大家看到了上海农村发展副食品生产的大好形势和有利条件。不少畜牧生产发展较好的公社和生产队已经实现了一亩地一头猪的计划。不少公社和生产队预计都能超额完成今年的养猪计划。就是一些生产比较差的公社或生产队，也有很大的潜力。上海县曹行公社目前饲养的猪虽然发展不快，但这个公社的母猪留得很多，只要加强领导，就能迅速改变落后面貌，很快发展起来。
    通过检查，有力地推动了当前畜牧业的发展。各县与公社都正在积极新建猪棚，大抓青粗饲料贮藏和防寒工作。奉贤县各个公社从7月中旬到10月底，已扩建和新建土猪棚五千五百多间。各县到目前止已贮藏一千二百万担饲料，仅松江一县就贮藏了三百万担。上海县梅陇公社陇西生产队和曹行公社中心、民建等生产队过去重视养猪不够，经检查后这些队的干部决定积极采取措施，在短期内迅速改变落后面貌。
    县和县、公社和公社之间在这次检查中相互交流了经验。如宝山、嘉定、崇明三个县的代表在相互检查后，认为嘉定县在饲养管理、防寒保暖和青贮饲料方面做得较好，而宝山县在因陋就简、自力更生、大搞土棚和选留良种方面做得较好。代表们决心相互学习，取长补短，共同跃进。奉贤县的代表认为上海县新泾公社曙光生产队将母猪、小猪、肉猪分开饲养的办法很好，表示回去要认真推广。
