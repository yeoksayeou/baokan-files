    A Flower on Calico
    Cheng Shangren
    Last year, at the Hunan Folk Arts Exhibition held in Beijing by the Chinese Artists Association, there were many exquisite patterns on folk drawnwork, batik, embroidery, brocade, and ethnic minority costumes. Many people loved them very much, but unfortunately, these beautiful and attractive dyed fabrics were few in number and difficult to buy. So people had a common idea: "How wonderful it would be if they could be mass-produced into calico by machine."
    Not long after, this idea has indeed become a reality. A batch of calico recently exhibited at the National Arts and Crafts Exhibition was produced by the Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory. Its patterns are taken from the patterns of dyed fabrics of the Dai, Miao, Yi, and Sani ethnic groups. Among them are patterns from batik, cross-stitch drawnwork, cotton fabrics, and embroidery. Although these calico patterns are imitations and not new creations, it is exciting to see calico, which is needed by the general public in daily life, appearing with distinctive ethnic characteristics and novel patterns. We know that many exquisite dyeing and weaving crafts, such as drawnwork and embroidery, are embroidered with thousands upon thousands of stitches. For example, Zhuang brocade is woven by hand with thousands upon thousands of shuttles. And batik is drawn and dyed stroke by stroke. These exquisite dyed fabrics with high artistic standards take a lot of time and effort to produce, so they are few in number. If we want to promote these handicrafts for enjoyment in the daily lives of the general public, there are certain difficulties at present. Now, the Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory uses silk screens to mass-produce them into calico, and people can enjoy it by spending only a few cents per foot. This is very much in line with the principle of "economic, practical, and beautiful," which is indeed a good thing. The benefit is not only that it promotes artistic creations from the hands of the people, but also that the scope of use of such artworks is wider. The patterns that were originally only used as trims can now be continuously printed on wide fabrics, so that they can still be used as trims after being cut, and two widths can be put together as bedspreads. They are also very beautiful and chic for making dresses. Other uses such as curtains and tablecloths are also very novel and pleasing to the eye. This factory's approach has made a flower bloom again on calico.
    At present, the calico produced in our country has made a great leap forward in terms of pattern design and printing technology, and many new colors and varieties have emerged, which are welcomed by the general public. However, regarding the production of calico, it still feels as if something is missing, like folk music and opera are not flavorful enough. I think it may be the lack of this kind of color with strong folk characteristics.
    Our country has a long tradition of culture and art. Dyeing and weaving crafts have been deeply rooted in people's lives for a long time, and dyed and woven patterns with high artistic levels have constantly appeared. And so many beautiful patterns with unique styles, like folk songs, have been passed down and used by people from generation to generation, and people still love them today. However, in the past, these folk patterns with various styles were rarely printed on calico, and this work cannot be ignored. We know that the purpose of creating printing machines is to print more good books and good paintings to meet people's cultural needs. The purpose of creating calico printing machines is also to produce more beautiful calico to meet people's clothing needs. We should carry out more fieldwork on national and folk patterns, and then collect, sort out, and apply them to the daily necessities of the people. This kind of promotion work cannot be unilaterally accused of "copying and transporting" or "this is not a creation method," etc., and looked down upon or unwilling to do this ordinary but meaningful work. In fact, the work of promotion is a process of learning from national and folk traditions through specific collection, sorting, and application. From this, we can understand the aesthetic habits of the masses of the people, and we can learn a lot of very good methods of pattern organization and color matching. These all help to improve and create our calico design level. (Attached picture)

    印花布上的一朵鲜花
    程尚仁
    去年，中国美术家协会在北京举办的湖南民间工艺美展中，有不少民间的挑花、腊染、刺绣、织锦，以及少数民族服装上的精美图案，许多人看后十分喜爱，可惜那些秀丽引人的染织品，为数不多、很难买到。于是人们产生了一个共同的念头：“把它用机器大量的印成花布，该有多好。”
    事隔不久，果然这个念头已成为事实了。最近在全国工艺美术展览会中展出的一批花布，是云南漂染厂生产的，其图案纹样就是采自傣族、苗族、彝族、撒尼族等的染织品的图案。其中有腊染上的，有十字挑花上的，有棉织物上的，也有刺绣上的图案纹样。虽然这些花布图案是仿制的，不是新的创作。可是在广大人民日常所需的花布上出现了具有民族特色，别开生面的图案纹样，这是值得令人兴奋的事。我们知道，许多精美的染织工艺品，如挑花、刺绣，它是千针万针绣出来的。如僮锦它是千梭万梭用手织出来的。又如腊染是一笔一笔描绘浸染出来的。这些具有很高艺术水平的精致的染织品，需要花不少时日和心血才能制作出来，所以为数不多。如要把这些手工艺品推广到广大人民日常生活中去享用，目前是有一定困难的。现在云南漂染厂采用丝网将它大量的印制成花布，人们只需花上几毛钱买一尺就能享用它。很符合“经济、实用、美观”的原则，这确是一件好事。其好处不但做到推广了出自人民之手的艺术创作，同时使这类艺术品的使用范围更广了，原来仅仅用作花边的图案纹样，现在可以连续印在宽幅的布面上，这样裁开以后仍可作花边应用，而两幅并起来便可作为被面，用作衣裙也非常美丽别致。其他如用作窗帘、台布等都十分新颖悦目。这个厂的这种做法，使印花布上又开放出了一朵鲜花。
    目前我国生产的花布，不论在图案设计方面，印制技术方面，都向前跃进了一大步，出现了许多新的花色品种，受到了广大人民的欢迎。可是关于印花布的生产，总还使人感到不像民间音乐、戏曲那样够味，好像还缺少一些什么东西似的。我想可能就是缺少这一类具有强烈的民间特点的花色。
    我国有悠久的文化艺术传统。染织工艺品很早以来就根深蒂固地流传在人民的生活中，并不断地出现过艺术水平很高的染织图案纹样。而这么多别具风格的美丽图案，它如同民间诗歌一样在人们生活中代代流传和使用，一直到今天人们仍然喜爱它。但是过去在花布上很少印这些具有各种风格的民间图案，这一工作是不能忽视的。我们知道，创造印刷机的目的，是多多的印出好书、好画来满足人们的文化需要。创造印花机的目的亦是多多生产好看的花布来满足人们衣着的需要。我们应多多进行民族民间图案的采风工作，然后加以汇集整理，运用到人民日常的服用品上去。这种推广工作不能片面的责之为“抄袭搬运”或“这不是创作方法”等，而看不起或不愿意去做这种平凡而有意义的工作。实际上推广的工作是通过具体的采集、整理、运用，向民族民间传统学习的一个过程，从中可了解到人民群众的欣赏习惯，可学到不少纹样组织，色彩调配的很多很好的方法。这都有助于提高和创造我们的花布设计水平。（附图片）
