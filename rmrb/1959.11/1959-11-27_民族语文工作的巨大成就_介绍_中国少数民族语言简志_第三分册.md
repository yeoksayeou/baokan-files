Great Achievements in National Linguistics Work
Introducing the Third Volume of "A Concise Record of Chinese Minority Languages"
Edited by the Institute of Minority Languages, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Published by Science Press Ma Xueliang

After the Party put forward the general line of building socialism last year, the Institute of Minority Languages of the Chinese Academy of Sciences responded to the Party's call and decided to organize forces inside and outside the institute to write a "Concise Record of Chinese Minority Languages" systematically introducing the situation of dozens of ethnic minority languages in our country within one year, in addition to completing other work in the research plan. The total number of words in this concise record will reach 1.5 million, divided into six volumes: the first volume on the Tibeto-Burman language family, the second volume on the Zhuang-Dong language family, the third volume on the Miao-Yao language family, the fourth volume on the Mongolian-Tungusic language family, the fifth volume on the Turkic language family, and the sixth volume on other languages. Now, the concise records of each language have been completed, and the third volume has been published by Science Press, and other volumes will also be published successively.

The Miao people are distributed in seven provinces (regions): Guizhou, Hunan, Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Hubei. All counties and cities in these seven provinces (regions) with a Miao population of more than 10,000 have been investigated, and more than 200 copies of vocabulary and grammar example materials have been recorded. In addition, a large number of long materials have been recorded. The Yao people are distributed in five provinces (regions): Guangxi, Hunan, Yunnan, Guangdong, and Guizhou. All counties in these five provinces (regions) with Yao people have been investigated, and separate records have been made for languages with slight differences. A total of more than 240 points have been investigated, and 130 copies of materials have been recorded. The published concise records of the Miao language and the Yao language are compiled based on these materials.

The editors mentioned in the preface of this volume that "Due to the limitation of space, the content is relatively brief and there are very few language materials. However, readers can see the general situation of the Miao and Yao languages from this." Even from this "general situation," it is already possible to see that many problems that capitalist countries and domestic scholars studying Miao and Yao languages have not been able to solve for many years have been presented with correct conclusions or preliminary arguments in this concise record. For example, in the past, some people classified the Miao and Yao languages into the Austro-Asiatic language family, and some people classified the Miao and Yao languages into one language family with the Thai language. Miao and Yao language workers have conducted comparative analysis and research work based on the rich materials obtained from the general survey of Miao and Yao languages, and affirmed in the concise record that the Miao and Yao languages belong to the Sino-Tibetan language family. This conclusion is correct and convincing. For another example, the problem of dividing dialects and languages is a relatively difficult problem for the Miao and Yao languages. There are more than 20 mutually unintelligible languages in the Miao language. How many dialects should these languages belong to? Miao language workers have conducted a long period of research and discussion on this issue. Based on the characteristics of phonetics, and with reference to the similarities and differences in grammar and vocabulary, they finally divided the Miao language into three dialects: Western Hunan, Eastern Guizhou, and Sichuan-Guizhou-Yunnan. Of course, the division of dialects cannot be based solely on language materials. According to the theory of Marxist linguistics, language belongs to the category of social phenomena, and the differentiation of language into dialects is related to the development of society. Therefore, in addition to analyzing and researching from the language itself, it is necessary to closely link the history of the people who use this language to conduct research in order to make it possible to divide dialects. Regarding this point, the concise record also mentions that the division of Miao dialects was based on social and historical conditions. Although comparative materials in this regard are not listed in the concise record, it is very obvious that the concise record has considered this aspect. The language difference of the Yao people is very large. In the past, no one had conducted comparative research on the Yao languages in various regions, and of course, there was no way to determine whether they spoke dialects of the same language or several different languages. After liberation, Yao language workers conducted a comprehensive comparison based on the materials collected and proved that in addition to some Yao people speaking dialects of Chinese, they spoke three different languages, which belonged to the Yao language branch, the Miao language branch, and the Zhuang-Dong language family, respectively. This is a new achievement in language comparative research.

In the past, the research on minority languages often focused on the analysis of phonetics, and rarely touched on grammar. The grammar of Miao and Yao languages has never been studied at all. Now the grammatical system of Miao and Yao languages has also been initially established, and briefly introduced in the concise record. The disadvantage is that the grammatical characteristics of some dialects and sub-dialects have not been reflected, but as a concise record, it is valuable that it can enable readers to see the grammatical overview of the Miao and Yao languages.

Chinese is the language of the main ethnic group, the Han, in our country, and it is also a common communication tool for all ethnic groups in the motherland. Chinese has played a great role in the rich development of minority languages. The two concise records in this volume combine the actual situation of language development and respectively point out the role of Chinese in enriching the development of the Miao and Yao languages, as well as the future development trends of the Miao and Yao languages. This kind of analysis and research is of great significance for promoting national unity, cultural exchange, and for the Miao and Yao people to learn Chinese.

### 民族语文工作的巨大成就  介绍“中国少数民族语言简志”第三分册

    民族语文工作的巨大成就
    介绍“中国少数民族语言简志”第三分册
    少数民族语言研究所主编　科学出版社出版  马学良
    去年党提出建设社会主义的总路线以后，中国科学院少数民族语言研究所响应党的号召，决定在一年内除完成研究计划中的其它工作外，还要组织所内外的力量写出一部系统地介绍我国几十种民族语言情况的“中国少数民族语言简志”。这部简志的总字数将达一百五十万，共分六个分册：第一分册藏缅语族，第二分册僮侗语族，第三分册苗瑶语族，第四分册蒙古语族通古斯语族，第五分册突厥语族，第六分册其它语言。现在，各语言的简志都已完成，并且第三分册已经由科学出版社出版，其他各分册也将陆续出版。
    苗族分布在贵州、湖南、云南、广西、四川、广东、湖北七个省（区），这七个省（区）凡是有苗族人口在一万以上的县市都作了调查，共记录了二百多份词汇和语法例句材料，此外还记录了大量的长篇材料。瑶族分布在广西、湖南、云南、广东、贵州五个省（区），这五个省（区）凡是有瑶族的县份都进行了调查，语言稍有差异的都分别作了记录，总共调查了二百四十多个点，记录了一百三十份材料。已出版的苗语简志和瑶族语言简志就是根据这些材料编写的。
    编者在这本分册的前言提到，“由于篇幅的限制，内容比较简略，语言材料也很少。不过读者可以由这里面看见苗、瑶语的一般情况”。就从这“一般情况”中，已经能够看出过去资本主义国家和国内研究苗、瑶语的学者多年得不到解决的很多问题，在这部简志中有的已经提出了正确的结论或初步的论断。例如，过去就有人把苗、瑶语列入南亚语系，也有人把苗、瑶语跟泰语列为一个语族。苗、瑶语工作者根据苗、瑶语普查所掌握的丰富材料进行了比较分析研究工作，在简志中肯定苗、瑶语属汉藏语系。这个结论是正确的，令人信服的。又例如，划分方言和语言的问题，对于苗、瑶语来说是比较困难的问题。苗语有二十多种互相说不通的话，这些话应当分别属于几个方言呢？关于这个问题，苗语工作者曾经进行了很长时期的研究、讨论。他们根据语音的特点，再参考语法、词汇的异同，最后把苗语划分为湘西、黔东、川黔滇三个方言。当然，划分方言不能专凭语言材料，根据马克思主义语言学的理论，语言是属于社会现象之列的，语言分化为方言是与社会的发展有关的，所以划分方言除了从语言本身分析研究以外，还必须密切联系使用这种语言的人民的历史去进行研究才有可能。关于这一点，简志也提到划分苗语方言曾经根据社会历史等方面的情况。虽然在简志中没有列举这方面的比较材料，但是简志对这方面曾经加以考虑是很明显的。瑶族的语言差别很大，过去从没有人进行过各地瑶族语言的比较研究，当然更无从确定他们说的是同一种语言的方言还是几种不同的语言。解放后，瑶语工作者根据所搜集的材料进行了全面的比较，证明瑶族除有一部分人说汉语的方言外，共操三种不同的语言，他们分别属于瑶语支、苗语支和僮侗语族。这是在语言比较研究方面的新成果。
    过去对少数民族语言的研究往往偏重在语音的分析，很少接触到语法，苗、瑶语的语法更根本没有人研究过。现在苗、瑶语的语法体系也初步建立起来，并且在简志中扼要地作了介绍。缺点是有一些方言、次方言的语法特点还没有被反映出来，但是作为简志来说，它能够使读者看到苗、瑶语的语法概况，也就难能可贵了。
    汉语是我国主体民族汉族的语言，也是祖国各民族共同交际的工具。汉语在少数民族语言的丰富发展中起了很大的作用。本分册的两种简志都结合了语言发展的实际情况，分别指出汉语在苗语和瑶族语言中丰富发展的作用以及苗族和瑶族语言今后发展的趋势。这种分析研究，对促进民族团结、文化交流和对苗族、瑶族学习汉语汉文都有重要的意义。
