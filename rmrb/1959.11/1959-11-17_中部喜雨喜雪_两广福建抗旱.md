Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: The drought in most of central China has largely been relieved, and the drought situation in other local areas has also been eased by renewed rainfall. The drought continues in most of Guangdong, southern Guangxi, and parts of coastal Fujian.

Following rainfall at the end of October and beginning of November, the central region of China experienced another round of rainfall from the 7th to the 9th due to a cold wave. On the 9th, the Huai River basin experienced snowfall, the earliest snowfall in the region since 1949.

Since November, the two rainfalls have brought more than 25 millimeters of rainfall to Shandong, the provinces along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, and northern Guangxi. In Jiangsu, northern Zhejiang, central Anhui, most of Jiangxi, western Fujian, and southern Hunan, the rainfall has been mostly over 50 millimeters, more than double the normal amount for the same period in previous years. The drought in these areas has been completely relieved. The drought in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi has also been basically relieved. The drought situation in parts of northern Henan and southern Shanxi has been further eased. Currently, only southern Fujian, most of Guangdong, and southern Guangxi remain dry due to lack of rain or little rain. The drought in these areas has generally lasted for about a month and a half. In Fujian Province, only the northwest received rain this time, while the drought-stricken coastal areas received no rain. Some areas of Guangdong Province also received rain, but the area covered was not extensive, and some areas received little rain, so the drought has not been relieved. The drought has been relieved in most areas of Guangxi, but only a few millimeters of rain fell in the south, and the drought is still developing. The masses in the drought-stricken areas of these three provinces are fighting the drought and racing to plant to ensure a good harvest.

This rainfall is extremely beneficial to the growth of wheat and rapeseed in the central region of China. Currently, winter wheat in areas north of the Huai River basin has begun to tiller, and seedlings have emerged in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, generally growing well. In the Han River basin and other areas, most of the rapeseed has grown five leaves, and second-class seedlings predominate. Due to the impact of the cold wave, the leaves of winter wheat in individual areas of the Yellow River basin have suffered slight frost damage, but the impact is not significant. A small number of sweet potatoes that were not properly stored have suffered some frost damage.

    中部喜雨喜雪
    两广福建抗旱
    新华社十六日讯　我国中部地区的旱象目前大部已经解除，其他局部地区的旱情也因降雨再度缓和。广东大部、广西南部和福建沿海部分地区旱象还在持续。
    继十月底、十一月初降雨之后，七日到九日我国中部地区因寒潮侵袭再度降雨。九日淮河流域降雪，这是这个地区一九四九年来最早一次降雪。
    十一月以来的两次降雨，山东、长江淮河流域各省及广西北部雨量都在二十五毫米以上，江苏、浙江北部、安徽中部、江西大部、福建西部、湖南南部等地雨量多在五十毫米以上，比常年同期多一倍多，这些地区的旱象已完全解除。陕西关中地区的旱象也基本解除。河南北部、山西南部的部分地区旱情有了进一步缓和。当前只有福建南部和广东大部、广西南部因无雨或雨少仍然干旱，这些地区旱象一般都已持续一个半月左右。福建省这次只有西北部下了雨，而干旱的沿海地区没有下雨；广东省部分地区也下了雨，但下的面不广，有些地区雨量也少，干旱没有解除；广西全区大部地区的旱象已解除，只有南部下了几毫米雨，旱情仍在发展。这三个省区受旱地区的群众正在抗旱抢种保丰收。
    这次降雨，对我国中部地区小麦、油菜生长极为有利。目前，淮河流域以北地区的冬小麦已开始分蘖，长江中下游沿岸地区已普遍出苗，一般生长良好。汉水流域等地油菜多已长出五片叶子，而且二类苗占多数。由于寒潮影响，黄河流域个别地区冬小麦叶子稍有冻害，但影响不大，少数地区没有收藏好的甘薯受到了一些冻害。
