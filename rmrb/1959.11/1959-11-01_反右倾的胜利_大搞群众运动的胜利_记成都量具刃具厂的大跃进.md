Victory of Anti-Rightism, Victory of Launching Mass Movements
——A Record of the Great Leap Forward at Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant

    The Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant in Sichuan Province adhered to the principles of "production first, welfare second; construction while producing," achieving more, faster, better, and more economically in building the factory. From preparation to completion, it took only one year and ten months, allowing it to fully start production in January 1958 ahead of schedule. After starting production, the factory reached its designed production level in just six months, and last year's output value increased more than six times compared to the state-assigned targets at the beginning of the year. This year, they completed the annual state plan in terms of total output value, production volume, cost, profit, and scrap rate, among other major indicators, 105 days ahead of schedule, meaning they completed the state-assigned production targets for the Second Five-Year Plan three years and three months ahead of schedule.

    Strengthen Party Leadership, Launch Mass Movements

    In the year and more since the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant started production, under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee, it has adhered to the Party's General Line and the mass line working method, and has continuously waged resolute struggles against all right-leaning thoughts. This is the fundamental reason for achieving the victory of the Great Leap Forward and the continuous leaps in production, each wave higher than the last.

    The mass movement at the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant developed on the basis of the rectification movement. At that time, the labor enthusiasm of the workers was unprecedentedly high, and a vigorous technical revolution and technical innovation upsurge was launched. The broad masses of workers eagerly demanded to reform outdated rules and regulations, participate in enterprise management, and fully play their role as masters of the country. However, those with right-leaning ideas believed that "workers cannot manage and cannot manage well." The factory Party committee first mobilized the masses to speak out freely, criticizing this kind of thinking. With a revolutionary spirit, they broke old conventions, devolved power, and implemented the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" (cadre participation in labor, worker participation in management; reform of irrational rules and regulations; combination of cadres, workers, and technicians), thereby changing the internal relationships within the enterprise, and the enterprise's appearance was completely renewed. The workers fully exerted their communist spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, putting forward thousands of rationalization proposals, realizing many major technical innovations, overcoming many key production problems, production order was orderly, management was greatly strengthened, plans were overfulfilled again and again, waste was reduced again and again, equipment was well maintained, accidents were greatly reduced, the masses consciously supervised product quality, and costs decreased month by month.

    However, just as the mass movement was developing vigorously, a few cadres failed to implement the mass line well, mistakenly believing that after the workers participated in management, they had nothing to do. Some even deliberately relaxed management work. A few leading cadres also believed that production had reached its peak and could not leap forward any further, and that continuing in this way would tire the workers and lead to "major mistakes." Under these circumstances, those who were originally dissatisfied with launching mass movements said things like: "Too much emphasis is being placed on mass movements," "Old rules and regulations have been vilified too much," "Decentralizing power has created chaos," and so on. This unhealthy trend of doubting and negating the achievements of the Great Leap Forward, and attempting to turn back the clock, once caused ideological confusion among some comrades and seriously hindered the in-depth development of the mass movement, so that the growth rate of the production plan slowed down at the end of last year, and even declined in January of this year.

    In response to the above situation, the factory Party committee resolutely implemented the provincial Party committee's instruction of "grasping tightly from the beginning and grasping tightly throughout," and launched a rectification movement throughout the factory, resolutely implementing the Party's policies and lines. Through mass-based exposure and education through speaking out, checking, and rectifying simultaneously, cadres with right-leaning sentiments took the initiative to examine their mistakes. Because the right-leaning thinking of opposing the launching of mass movements was seriously criticized and struggled against, obstacles were removed, and a new production upsurge was launched.

    In order to consolidate and promote the high labor enthusiasm of the workers, and to further adapt enterprise management to promote the in-depth development of the mass movement, the factory Party committee again mobilized the masses to carry out mass-based economic accounting work from the factory headquarters and workshops down to the work teams and individuals, combining the vigorous mass movement with in-depth and meticulous economic work. They criticized the erroneous idea of relying only on a few professionals to engage in economic accounting, and of mystifying economic accounting, and adhered to the method of promoting economic accounting work by launching mass movements. They adopted various forms, such as detailed accounting, holding exhibitions, convening on-site meetings, and establishing banners, to vigorously publicize the importance of economic accounting. According to the principle of strengthening the combination of professional accounting and mass accounting, various accounting systems and quotas were formulated and improved, and various indicators were implemented to production teams and individuals as the main conditions for team evaluation and rewards. At the same time, a comprehensive reward method was formulated, combining the promotion of economic accounting with labor competitions and material incentives, promoting and driving each other forward. As a result, economic accounting was fully implemented throughout the factory in just one month, further enriching and improving enterprise management work, and greatly strengthening the workers' sense of responsibility as masters of the country, further establishing the idea of ​​building the country through diligence and thrift, and loving the factory as one's home, and production leapt forward and rose daily.

    In order to lead the mass movement from one victory to another, in June this year, according to the instructions of the provincial, municipal, and ministry bureaus, the factory Party committee led the masses to deeply launch the movement to increase production and practice economy with high quality and high output. As soon as this movement was launched, right-leaning thinking reared its head again. They exaggerated the shortcomings of the decline in the quality of certain products during a certain period, and described the Great Leap Forward as "only a quantitative leap forward, with no leap forward in quality and technology." Some people opposed increasing output and improving quality, believing that "only by lowering output targets can product quality be guaranteed," and pinning their hopes for improving quality on inspectors checking. The factory Party committee firmly adopted the policy of launching mass movements. After a factory-wide debate, the workers cited a large number of facts to criticize the one-sided view that "quality and quantity" cannot be pursued simultaneously, and the erroneous argument that "there is no great leap forward in technology and quality." Immediately afterwards, the Party committee emphasized that we must guide our actions with the Party's General Line, both improve product quality and ensure the completion of the state plan. Therefore, the masses were immediately mobilized to launch a vigorous competition movement for high-quality and high-yield red banner workers. As soon as the competition started, the cutter workshop took the lead, inviting advanced producers such as Tian Jingqi to introduce their advanced experience in high-quality and high-yield production. On the same day, more than 60 people in the entire workshop broke the daily output quota of 1,000 minutes, setting off a competition craze to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and strive to become red banner workers. The factory leaders also announced the key quality issues to the masses, adopting the three-determination method of fixing people, fixing measures, and fixing time, and implementing the key issues to teams and individuals at all levels. In this way, a red banner worker competition movement to overcome key problems, improve product quality, and achieve high-quality and high-yield production quickly developed.

    Process regulations are an important means to ensure product quality and improve labor productivity, and are also the basis for production preparation and determining process equipment. The factory regards rectifying and implementing process regulations as an important organizational guarantee for achieving high quality and high output, and closely combines the rectification and implementation of processes with vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution to enrich the content of process regulations. However, some people are unwilling to absorb the results of mass technical innovations and rich experience, and attempt to handle affairs according to old process regulations. Therefore, in rectifying the process, the factory Party committee first affirmed the technical innovation proposals of the masses since last year; and decided that the rectification of the process must be carried out through the masses, and then launched a mass-based process census to summarize the advanced experiences created by the masses or learned from others since the Great Leap Forward and incorporate them into the process regulations. In this way, the rectification of process regulations is based on the mass movement, making it a powerful weapon to promote production and improve quality.

    Vigorously Promote Technical Innovation and Drive Continuous Leaps in Production

    Technical innovation and technical revolution are the central content of the mass movement launched by the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant. The development process of technical innovation is also a process of continuous struggle against right-leaning thinking. At the beginning, some people believed that "we have new equipment with a high degree of mechanization and automation, so there is no room for innovation," especially some technicians, who believed that everything was untouchable, mystified and absolutized modern equipment, and held a skeptical or even negative attitude towards whether foreign enterprises could innovate. After the masses rose up, production continued to develop and break through the old balance, and new imbalances appeared. Individual passive equilibrium theorists shouted that "production is chaotic," "product quality is poor because production has increased too fast," and so on, attempting to limit production to a backward level. These are, in essence, right-leaning thoughts that are content with the status quo, do not want mass movements, and do not want the Great Leap Forward. The factory Party committee resolutely criticized this kind of thinking, strongly supported the innovation proposals of the masses, and called on the workers to emancipate their minds, break superstitions, and boldly innovate. Under the leadership of advanced producers Zhong Zhigang and Hu Jiafu, who pioneered new records and increased work efficiency by 30 times and 40 times, Tian Jingqi, who completed six months of work in one month, and excellent apprentice Zhang Baomei, who improved the scale machine and increased work efficiency by 15 times, a technical innovation upsurge was set off throughout the factory, with innovations and inventions emerging one after another, resulting in innovation proposals that increased work efficiency by 600 times and 1,800 times. This fact gave a powerful counterattack to mystifiers, "untouchable" theorists, and passive equilibrium theorists.

    After the technical innovation movement was widely launched, the factory Party committee continuously proposed higher and newer goals to the masses, such as "breaking through the one million daily output mark" and "entering 1960 and moving towards 1962." All workshops, teams, and individuals repeatedly discussed and formulated plans, and launched a vigorous competition to seize key issues and projects through competitions and challenges. Technical personnel were also mobilized to go deep into production and form three-way combination groups to work together and solve production technical problems in a timely manner. In this way, the technical innovation movement was carried out more deeply and widely. Many major technical problems were solved easily in front of the masses, and production capacity developed rapidly. At present, the factory has exceeded the original designed production level by three times, and several major products have exceeded the designed production level by 1.9 to 65 times, and product quality has been greatly improved and costs have been significantly reduced.

    In order to continue the leap forward, the factory's technical innovation movement is now developing towards the adoption of new technologies, new processes, and automation, and marching towards the cutting edge of technology. At this time, people with right-leaning conservative ideas came out to obstruct, saying, "The factory has only been built for one or two years, and they want to engage in automation. They want to run before they can crawl." The factory leaders still insisted on relying on the masses and boldly experimenting, and finally overcame many difficulties and achieved success. For example, the new process of twisting drill bits has now been officially put into production, increasing work efficiency by seven times and saving more than 50% of high-quality steel, realizing another major measure to save materials; the caliper assembly line was officially put into production in October, increasing mechanical operation from 10% in the past to 70%, changing the scattered production to strict and rhythmic production, shortening the production cycle by 80%, and increasing overall work efficiency by 2.5 times. In addition, twelve new precision and cutting-edge products have been successfully trial-produced.

    Another important reason for the major achievements in technical innovation at the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant is the firm implementation of the policy of using both indigenous and foreign methods, and the spirit of overcoming difficulties and relying on self-reliance in every possible way. The factory Party committee put forward the slogan of "simplification, economization, and high speed" to the workers, and mobilized the masses to manufacture many special equipment, such as using old and broken lathes and rolling mill arches discarded in the waste pile to transform them into modern twisting drill bit equipment, thereby arming themselves and balancing production capacity. Under the new situation of multiple increases in production, there was a shortage of raw materials and auxiliary materials. Under these circumstances, should production be stopped? Or should we continue to leap forward? The factory Party committee resolutely relied on the masses, and on the premise of ensuring quality, took a series of measures such as cold drawing, hot drawing, rolling and forging, heat treatment, precision casting, and the use of waste materials, as well as modifying designs and processes, saving and substituting more than 1,000 tons of high-quality steel this year alone. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient material supply, the factory also opened satellite factories. Their newly built iron and steel branch factory can smelt various tool steels and will gradually meet their own needs.

    Comprehensive Care for the Growth of New Forces

    The Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant is characterized by a large number of new workers and a low level of technical skills. Therefore, it is important to educate and improve new workers politically, give full play to their labor enthusiasm, and at the same time, rapidly improve their technical level, guide their production enthusiasm and creativity to technical innovation and technical revolution, and combine hard work and clever work. This is an important condition for ensuring the leap forward in production.

    Improving the political and ideological awareness of new workers is the most fundamental. The political consciousness of the workers in this factory has been greatly improved through a series of mass movements. Since last year, excellent apprentice movements and ideological military training movements have been carried out one after another. Leading cadres also go deep into the dormitories, discover and solve ideological problems in a timely manner by talking with the masses, exchanging opinions, and making friends, which further strengthens the relationship between cadres and the masses and encourages the workers' enthusiasm for production.

    At the same time, they also paid attention to continuously improving the technical level of new workers. This year, in the high-quality and high-yield movement, closely combined with production practice, with the implementation of process regulations and safe operating procedures as the main content, a mass-based technical military training movement was carried out among grassroots cadres and workers, especially new workers. According to the principle of "those who are able are teachers, teaching and learning from each other," they adopted the method of establishing training classes with the work section as the unit, with veteran workers and technicians serving as teachers and counselors, and combining classroom lectures with group discussions, and combining learning theory with practical operation, and the effect was very good. In addition to carrying out mass-based technical education in connection with current tasks, a complete set of spare-time schools for workers, from elementary schools, middle schools, secondary technical schools, and even universities, were opened at all levels, and various professional and technical short-term training classes were established for full-time, part-time, or spare-time employees to conduct regular cultural and technical education.

    Through the above-mentioned series of work, the ideological awareness and technical level of the workers have been greatly improved. More and more people have the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and the communist labor attitude of not calculating rewards and not talking about conditions. The originally backward workers have also transformed one after another, and many have become advanced producers and high-quality and high-yield red banner workers, and many new workers have become the backbone of production. A large number of new forces have grown up rapidly in this way.

    While grasping production and grasping ideology, the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant also paid attention to grasping life. This is an important aspect to ensure the sustained development of the mass movement. According to the principle of diligence and thrift in running all undertakings, they have established welfare facilities such as canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, children's primary schools, health centers, bathrooms, teahouses, barbershops, visiting relatives' hostels, mother-child dormitories, and clubs. After mobilizing family members to participate in production last year, they developed nurseries and kindergartens that can accommodate more than 600 people, and ten canteens that can accommodate more than 10,000 people, and developed sideline production such as raising pigs, growing vegetables, and raising fish. At present, more than 800 pigs and more than 40 mu of vegetables have been raised.

    Although the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant has achieved the above achievements, they are not satisfied. They are determined to fight hard in the fourth quarter, to achieve advance again and again and overfulfillment again and again in production, and to humbly learn from the advanced experience of various brother factories, and on the basis of having completed the state plan, resolutely guarantee the overfulfillment of the increased production plan.

    反右倾的胜利　大搞群众运动的胜利
    ——记成都量具刃具厂的大跃进
    四川省成都量具刃具厂坚持了“先生产，后福利；边建设，边生产”的多快好省、勤俭办工厂的原则，从筹备到建成仅用了一年十个月的时间，提前在1958年1月全面投入生产。这个工厂在投入生产后，仅用六个月的时间就达到设计生产水平，去年的产值比年初国家下达的指标增加了六倍多。今年他们又提前一百零五天在总产值、产量、成本、利润和废品率等几个主要指标上，全面地完成了全年的国家计划，也就是提前三年零三个多月完成了国家下达的第二个五年计划的生产指标。
    加强党的领导  大搞群众运动
    成都量具刃具厂投入生产的一年多来，在上级党委的领导下，坚持了党的总路线和群众路线的工作方法，向一切右倾思想不断地进行了坚决的斗争，这是取得了大跃进的胜利，生产出现了一跃再跃，一浪高过一浪的根本原因。
    成都量具刃具厂的群众运动是在整风运动的基础上发展起来的，当时职工群众的劳动热情空前高涨，掀起了轰轰烈烈的技术革命和技术革新高潮。广大职工群众迫切要求改革陈规旧矩，参加企业管理，充分发挥主人翁的作用。而有右倾思想的人却认为“工人管不了，也管不好”。厂党委首先发动群众大鸣大放，对这种思想，进行了批判，并以革命的精神，大破陈规，下放权力，实行了“两参一改三结合”，从而改变了企业内部的相互关系，企业面貌焕然一新。职工群众充分发挥敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，提出了成千上万条的合理化建议，实现了许多重大技术革新，攻克了不少生产关键，生产秩序有条不紊，管理工作大大加强，计划超额再超额，废品减少再减少，设备维护良好，事故大大减少，群众自觉的监督产品质量，成本逐月下降。
    但是正当群众运动蓬勃发展的时候，却有少数干部未能很好贯彻群众路线，错误地认为工人参加管理后，自己无事可作了，有的甚至故意放松了管理工作。少数领导干部还认为生产到顶了，再也不能跃进了，长此下去，使职工疲劳，要犯“大错误”。在这种情况下，原来就对大搞群众运动不满的人，又说什么：“大搞群众运动强调过多了”，“把旧的规章制度丑化过分了”，“下放权力造成了混乱”等等。这种怀疑和否定大跃进的成绩，企图走回头路的歪风，一度造成了某些同志思想上的混乱，严重地阻碍了群众运动的深入发展，以致去年年末生产计划增长速度缓慢，今年1月还有所下降。
    针对以上情况，厂党委坚决贯彻了省委“一开头就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧”的指示，在全厂范围内开展了一次整风运动，坚决贯彻党的方针政策路线。通过边鸣放边检查边整改的群众性的揭发和教育，有右倾情绪的干部主动检查了自己的错误。由于对反对大搞群众运动的右倾思想进行了严肃批判和斗争，扫除了障碍，掀起了新的生产高潮。
    为了巩固和发扬职工群众高涨的劳动热情，使企业管理进一步适应和促进群众运动的深入发展，厂党委又发动群众，开展了从厂部、车间直至班组、个人的群众性的经济核算工作，把轰轰烈烈的群众运动和深入细致的经济工作结合起来。他们批判了只依靠少数专业人员搞经济核算，把经济核算神秘化的错误思想，坚持了用大搞群众运动的方法推行经济核算工作。他们采取算细账，举办展览会，召开现场会，树立旗帜等各种形式，大张旗鼓地宣传了经济核算的重要意义；根据加强专业核算与群众核算相结合的方针，制定和健全了各种核算制度和定额，并把各项指标落实到生产小组和个人，作为小组评比奖励的主要条件。与此同时还制定了综合奖励办法，把推行经济核算和劳动竞赛、物质鼓励三者结合起来，互相促进，互相推动。因而，只用了一个月的时间，就在全厂范围内全面推行了经济核算，进一步充实和健全了企业管理工作，并且大大加强了职工的主人翁的责任感，进一步树立了勤俭建国、爱厂如家思想，生产突飞猛进，逐日上升。
    为了把群众运动由一个胜利引向又一个胜利，今年6月厂党委根据省、市委和部局的指示，领导群众深入开展了优质高产的增产节约运动。这一运动刚开展，右倾思想又有所抬头，他们夸大某一时期某种产品质量下降的缺点，把大跃进说成了“只是数量跃进，质量和技术没有跃进”。有的把提高产量和提高质量对立起来，认为：“只有压低产量指标，才能保证产品质量”，把提高质量的希望寄托于检查员把关。厂党委则坚定不移地采取了大搞群众运动的方针。经过全厂大辩论，职工们举出了大量的事实批判了“质和量”不能并举的片面观点，及“技术和质量没有大跃进”的错误论调。紧接着党委又强调指出：必须以党的总路线指导我们的行动，既要提高产品质量，又要保证完成国家计划。于是，立即发动群众，开展了轰轰烈烈的优质高产红旗手竞赛运动。竞赛一开始，刃具车间一马当先，请田景琦等先进生产者介绍了他们优质高产的先进经验，当天，全车间就有六十多人突破日产千分钟定额，掀起了学先进、赶先进，人人争当红旗手的竞赛热潮。厂领导上还把质量关键向群众公布，采取定人、定措施、定时间的三定办法，把关键层层落实到小组、个人。这样，一个攻克关键，提高产品质量，实现优质高产的红旗手竞赛运动，迅速向前发展了。
    工艺规程是保证产品质量，提高劳动生产率的重要手段，也是进行生产准备和决定工艺装备的依据。这个厂把整顿和贯彻工艺规程作为达到优质高产的重要组织保证，并把整顿贯彻工艺和大闹技术革新和技术革命紧密结合起来，来充实和丰富工艺规程的内容。但是，也有一部分人不愿意吸取群众技术革新的成果和丰富的经验，企图按照老工艺规矩办事。因此，厂党委在整顿工艺中，首先肯定了去年以来群众的技术革新建议；并且决定整顿工艺必须通过群众，接着就开展了群众性的普查工艺工作，总结了大跃进以来群众创造或学习别人的先进经验，纳入工艺规程。这样，就把整顿工艺规程建立在群众运动的基础上，使之真正成为促进生产，提高质量的有力武器。
    大闹技术革新  推动生产不断跃进
    技术革新和技术革命是成都量具刃具厂大搞群众运动的中心内容。技术革新的发展过程也是不断和右倾思想斗争的过程。一开始，有的人认为“我们是新设备，机械化、自动化的程度高，没革头”，特别是一部分技术人员，认为一切都动不得，把现代化设备神秘化、绝对化，对大洋企业能否革新抱着怀疑甚至否定的态度。当群众起来以后，生产不断发展冲破旧的平衡，出现了新的不平衡，个别消极平衡论者又大叫什么“生产混乱了”，“产品质量不好，就是因为产量增加太快”等等，企图把生产限制在落后的水平上。这些，实质上都是安于现状，不要群众运动，不要大跃进的右倾思想。厂党委对这种思想坚决进行了批判，大力支持群众的革新建议，号召职工群众解放思想，破除迷信，大胆革新。在先进生产者钟志刚、胡家福首创新纪录，提高工效三十倍、四十倍，田景琦一个月干完六个月的工作量和优秀学工张宝梅改进刻度机提高工效十五倍的带动下，全厂掀起了技术革新的高潮，创造发明，风起云涌，出现了提高工效六百倍、一千八百倍的革新建议。这一事实给予神秘论者、“动不得”论者、消极平衡论者一个有力的回击。
    在技术革新运动广泛开展起来以后，厂党委又不断地向群众提出“突破日产百万关”、“跨进1960年，向1962年迈进”等更高的新的奋斗目标，各车间、小组、个人都反复讨论，制订规划，通过比武打擂，掀起了轰轰烈烈的夺关键、抢课题的竞赛热潮。并发动技术人员深入生产，组成三结合小组，同心合力，及时解决生产技术问题。这样，就使技术革新运动更加深入广泛地开展起来。许多重大技术关键，在群众面前迎刃而解，生产能力飞速发展。目前，这个厂已超过原设计生产水平三倍，几种主要产品分别超过设计生产水平一点九倍至六十五倍，而且产品质量大大提高，成本显著降低。
    为了继续跃进，现在全厂的技术革新运动，已向采用新技术、新工艺、自动化的方向发展，向技术尖端进军。这时，有右倾保守思想的人又出来阻挠，他们说：“建厂才一、二年，就要搞自动化，刚会爬就要跑”，而厂领导上仍然坚持依靠群众，大胆试验，终于克服了重重困难，取得了成就。如扭制钻头新工艺，现在已经正式投入生产，提高工效七倍，节约优质钢材50％以上，实现了节约材料的又一重大措施；卡尺装配流水线已于10月正式投入生产，机械操作由过去的10％提高到70％，把分散的生产，改为严格而有节奏的生产，生产周期缩短80％，整个工效提高二点五倍。此外，还试制成功了精密和尖端的新产品十二种。
    成都量具刃具厂技术革新取得重大成就的另一个重要原因，是坚决贯彻了土洋并举、两条腿走路的方针，和千方百计战胜困难、自力更生的精神。厂党委向职工提出了“简易化、经济化、高速化”的口号，发动群众制成了许多专用设备，如利用老破车床和丢在废料堆里的轧钢机牌坊，改作成了现代化的扭制钻头设备，从而武装了自己，平衡了生产能力。在生产成倍增长的新形势下，又出现了原材料和辅助材料供应不足的情况。在这种情况下，是停止生产？还是继续跃进？厂党委坚决依靠群众，在保证质量的前提下，采取了冷拔、热拉、轧锻、热处理、精密铸造和利用废料，以及修改设计、工艺等一系列措施，仅今年就节约代用了一千多吨优质钢材。为了解决材料供应不足的困难，这个厂还开办了卫星厂。他们新建的钢铁分厂，可以冶炼各种工具钢，将逐步满足自己的需要。
    全面关怀新生力量的成长
    成都量具刃具厂的特点是新工人多，技术水平低。因此，从政治上教育提高新工人，充分发挥他们的劳动热情，同时迅速提高他们的技术水平，把他们的生产积极性和创造性引向技术革新和技术革命，使苦干和巧干结合起来，这是保证生产跃进再跃进的重要条件。
    从政治思想上提高新工人的觉悟，这是最根本的。这个厂的职工经过一系列的群众运动，政治觉悟大大提高。去年以来，又先后开展了优秀学工运动，和思想大练兵运动。领导干部也深入宿舍，通过与群众谈心，交换意见，交朋友，及时发现和解决思想问题，这样更密切了干部和群众的关系，鼓舞了工人的生产积极性。
    同时，他们还注意了不断提高新工人的技术水平。今年在优质高产运动中，紧密结合生产实际以贯彻工艺规程和安全操作规程为主要内容，在基层干部和工人中，主要是新工人中，开展了群众性的技术大练兵运动。根据“能者为师、互教互学”的原则，他们采取以工段为单位成立训练班，由老工人、技术员担任教员、辅导员，采用了课堂讲授与小组讨论相结合、学理论与实际操作相结合的教学办法，效果很好。除了结合当前任务，进行群众性的技术教育外，还分级开办了小学、中学、中等技术学校以至大学等一整套的职工业余学校，设立了脱产、半脱产或业余的各种专业工种短期训练班，对职工进行经常性的文化技术教育。
    通过上述一系列的工作，大大提高了职工的思想觉悟和技术水平。具有敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格和不计报酬、不讲条件的共产主义劳动态度的人越来越多了。原来落后的工人，也纷纷转变，不少已成为先进生产者、优质高产红旗手，许多新工人已经成为生产上的骨干。大批新生力量就这样迅速地成长起来了。
    成都量具刃具厂在抓生产抓思想的同时，也注意了抓生活。这是保证群众运动持续发展的一个重要方面。他们根据勤俭办一切事业的原则，设立了食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、子弟小学、卫生所、浴室、茶社、理发室、探亲招待所、母子宿舍、俱乐部等福利设施。去年在发动家属参加生产以后，发展了能收托六百多人的托儿所、幼儿园，和能容纳一万多人的十个食堂，并发展养猪、种菜、养鱼等副业生产，目前已养猪八百多头，种菜四十多亩。
    成都量具刃具厂虽然取得以上成绩，但是他们是不满足的，他们下决心奋战四季度，在生产上做到提前再提前，超额再超额，并虚心学习各兄弟厂的先进经验，在已完成国家计划的基础上，坚决保证超额完成增产计划。
