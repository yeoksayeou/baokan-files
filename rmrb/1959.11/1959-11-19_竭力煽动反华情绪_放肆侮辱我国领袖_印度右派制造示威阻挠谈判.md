Xinhua News Agency, November 18th, New Delhi Dispatch: Since the publication of Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Nehru on November 7th, Indian right-wing parties have continuously organized demonstrations, desperately inciting anti-China sentiment, shamelessly insulting Chinese leaders, and demanding that the Indian government adopt a "tough" stance. They are afraid that the Sino-Indian border dispute will be resolved reasonably and peacefully, and therefore are trying to obstruct Sino-Indian negotiations.

According to the "Times of India," about one hundred thugs from the so-called "Bolshevik Party" of India held an anti-China demonstration in front of the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi on the 17th. They openly burned portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, frantically shouting "Death to Zhou Enlai" and slanderous slogans against China, demanding that the so-called "Chinese aggressors" leave India.

Leading the demonstration was the party's General Secretary, Chaju Ram, who fiercely attacked the Communist Party of India.

He also accused the Indian government of failing to prevent the so-called "aggressors" from occupying large tracts of Indian territory, which has shaken the people's trust in it. He criticized the Indian government for insisting "like a parrot" that it would not seek foreign military aid under any circumstances.

According to a report in the "Hindustan Standard" on the 17th, nearly five hundred members and supporters of the reactionary caste party, the Indian People's League, held an anti-China demonstration in front of the Parliament Building on the 16th. They shouted anti-China slogans, holding signs opposing negotiations and slandering China: "No negotiations until the aggressors withdraw," "Panchsheel is a lie," "Liberate Ladakh (referring to the western border territories of China's Xinjiang and Tibet)," etc.

This demonstration was part of the so-called "Expel Chinese Aggressors Day" launched nationwide by the People's League after Premier Zhou's letter was published. Leading the demonstration were People's League Chairman Balraj Madhok and another leader of the party, Sani.

The Communist Party of India was also attacked during this demonstration.

Two members of the People's House from the People's Socialist Party and Indian People's Socialist League member Bajpai, speaking to the demonstrators, demanded that the Communist Party of India be banned. They also criticized the Indian government's perceived weakness in handling the border dispute with China. Demonstrators demanded the resignation of Indian Defense Minister Menon, shouting "Indian security requires the appointment of a new Defense Minister."

Prior to this, on November 9th, approximately forty thugs claiming to be from the "Servants' Union" "demonstrated" in front of the Chinese Embassy, shouting reactionary slogans such as "Death to Zhou Enlai," "Death to Chinese plunderers," "Get out of India," and burning Premier Zhou's portrait. They were hostile to Sino-Indian friendship, and one sign read "China's friends are India's enemies." At the same time, they also attacked Prime Minister Nehru.

According to Madras reports, the Indian Youth Congress, controlled by the Congress Party, attempted to organize students from fifteen universities across the city to participate in anti-China demonstrations on the 9th, but only students from two universities participated.

On November 14th, the Delhi State Congress Committee also organized an anti-China demonstration, shouting slanderous slogans against China such as "Chinese aggressors get out." After the demonstration, a rally was held where Gupta, Chairman of the Delhi State Congress Committee, and Mohan, the General Secretary, delivered speeches slandering China's "aggression" against Indian territory.

    竭力煽动反华情绪　放肆侮辱我国领袖
    印度右派制造示威阻挠谈判
    新华社18日讯　新德里消息：印度右翼党派在周恩来总理11月7日给尼赫鲁信件发表以后，连续组织示威，竭力煽动反华情绪，放肆侮辱中国领袖，并且要求印度政府采取“强硬”态度。他们唯恐中印边界纠纷得到合理的和平解决，因此力图阻挠中印举行谈判。
    据“印度时报”报道，印度所谓“布尔什维克党”的约一百名暴徒17日在新德里中国大使馆门前举行反华示威游行。他们公然烧毛泽东主席和周恩来总理的画像，疯狂地喊着“该死周恩来”和诬蔑中国的口号，要求所谓“中国侵略者”离开印度。
    领头示威的是这个党的总书记查朱·拉姆，他猛烈攻击印度共产党。
    他还指责印度政府不能防止所谓“侵略者”占领印度的大片领土，这已动摇了人民对它的信任。他抨击印度政府“像鹦鹉似的”坚持说它无论如何不寻求外国军事援助。
    据“印度斯坦旗报”17日报道，反动教族政党印度人民同盟的盟员和它的支持者近五百人，16日在议会大厦前面举行反华示威。他们喊着反华口号，手里拿着反对谈判、诬蔑中国的标语牌：“在侵略军撤走之前不举行谈判”、“潘查希拉是谎言”、“解放拉达克（指中国新疆和西藏西部边境领土）和朗久”等。
    这次示威是人民同盟在周总理的信发表后决定在全国发动的所谓“驱逐中国侵略者日”的一部分。带头示威的是人民同盟主席巴拉杰·马多克和这个党的另一领袖萨尼。
    在这次示威中还攻击印度共产党。
    人民社会党的两名人民院议员和印度人民社会同盟议员巴志帕伊向示威者讲话时要求禁止印度共产党。他们还指责印度政府在处理同中国的边界争端中的他们认为是软弱做法。示威者要求印度国防部长梅农辞职，他们叫嚷“印度的安全要求任命新的国防部长”。
    在这以前，11月9日大约有四十名自称是“仆人工会”的暴徒在中国大使馆门前“示威”，叫着“周恩来该死”、“中国掠夺者该死”、“滚出印度去”等反动口号，烧毁了周总理的画像，他们敌视中印友好，有一块标语牌上写着“中国的朋友就是印度的敌人”的口号。同时，他们还攻击尼赫鲁总理。
    据马德拉斯消息，国大党控制的印度青年大会9日曾企图组织全城十五所大学学生参加反华示威，但是只有两所大学的学生参加了。
    11月14日，德里邦国大党委员会也组织了一次反华示威，高喊“中国侵略者滚回去”等诬蔑中国的口号。示威以后举行了集会，德里邦国大党委员会主席古普塔和总书记莫汉在会上发表了诬蔑中国“侵略”印度领土的讲话。
