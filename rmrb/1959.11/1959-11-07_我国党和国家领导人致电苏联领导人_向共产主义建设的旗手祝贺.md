Xinhua News Agency, November 6th—Our Party and State leaders sent a telegram to Soviet Party and State leaders on the 6th, warmly congratulating the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows:
To Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Comrade K.Y. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union:
    On the occasion of the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, we, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese Government, and the Chinese people, and in our own names, extend our warmest brotherly congratulations to you and to all the Soviet people—the most loyal friends of progressive humanity, the builders of communism.
    The October Revolution was a fundamental turning point in human history and a guiding light for the ultimate liberation of all oppressed and exploited people from the shackles of capitalism. Over the past forty-two years, the growing power of the Soviet Union, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the vigorous development of the national liberation movement, and the decline of capitalism have made the epoch-making significance of the October Revolution and the invincible vitality of Marxism-Leninism even more apparent to mankind.
    The great Soviet people, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee headed by Comrade Khrushchev, are victoriously implementing the grand program of communist construction—the Seven-Year Plan—with high political enthusiasm and selfless labor. The early and over-fulfillment of the Soviet Union's national economic plan for the first three quarters of 1959 convincingly demonstrates that the time it will take for the Soviet Union to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries will be greatly shortened. The successful launch of space rockets and the establishment of automatic interplanetary stations by the Soviet Union have opened a new era for mankind's conquest of the universe. The Chinese people wholeheartedly congratulate the Soviet people on these brilliant achievements.
    In the past year, the forces of peace have grown unprecedentedly strong, and the forces of war have become increasingly isolated. Not long ago, Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States and the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, and recently the letter to all parliaments of the world adopted by the Third Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the issue of easing international tensions and disarmament, fully expressed mankind's desire for peace and once again made a great contribution to easing international tensions and safeguarding world peace. The Chinese people fully agree with and support these peace initiatives of the Soviet Union and are willing to work with the Soviet people and the people of all countries for their thorough realization.
    Under the immortal banner of Marx and Lenin, the Sino-Soviet unity and friendship, built on the basis of proletarian internationalism, have been unprecedentedly consolidated and developed. Not long ago, the Soviet Party and government delegation headed by Comrade Khrushchev attended our country's 10th anniversary celebration, which was a great encouragement to our people. In the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and the cause of building socialism, the Soviet people have consistently given strong support and great assistance, for which the Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude. The Chinese people will continue to strive to strengthen the friendship between our two peoples and the unity and friendship of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    We wish you and all the Soviet people new and greater achievements in the cause of communist construction and the struggle for lasting world peace!
    Long live the Great October Socialist Revolution!
    Long live eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!
    Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
                        Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
                        Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China
    Zhu De,  Chairman  of the Standing Committee  of  the  National  People's  Congress  of  the  People's Republic of China
    Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China
                                  November 6, 1959, in Beijing
Xinhua News Agency, November 6th—Chen Yi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, sent a telegram to Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko on the 6th, congratulating the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The full text of the telegram is as follows:
To Comrade A.A. Gromyko, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics:
    On the occasion of the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, I extend to you my warm brotherly congratulations. The great Soviet Union is a strong fortress for defending world peace and maintaining human progress. The great efforts made by the Soviet government for the cause of world peace have been warmly praised and universally supported by peace-loving countries and people all over the world. I heartily wish you new and greater achievements in carrying out the Soviet government's peaceful foreign policy.
                                Chen Yi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
                                             November 6, 1959

    我国党和国家领导人致电苏联领导人
    向共产主义建设的旗手祝贺
    新华社6日讯　中华人民共和国党和国家领导人在6日打电报给苏联党和国家领导人，热烈祝贺伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年。贺电全文如下：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志，苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席克·叶·伏罗希洛夫同志：
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年的时候，我们谨代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，并且以我们个人的名义，向你们和全体苏联人民——进步人类最忠实的朋友、共产主义的建设者们，致以最热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    十月革命是人类历史的根本转折点，是一切被压迫、被剥削的人民从资本主义枷锁下最终解放的指路明灯。四十二年来，苏联和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的日益壮大，民族解放运动的蓬勃发展，资本主义的日暮途穷，使人类更明显地看出十月革命的划时代意义和马克思列宁主义战无不胜的生命力。
    伟大的苏联人民，在光荣的苏联共产党和以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，正以高度的政治热情和忘我的劳动，胜利地实现着共产主义建设的宏伟纲领——七年计划。1959年前三季度苏联国民经济计划的提前和超额完成令人信服地表明，苏联赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家的时间，必将大大缩短。苏联成功地发射宇宙火箭和建立自动行星际站，为人类征服宇宙开辟了新的纪元。中国人民由衷地祝贺苏联人民所取得的这些辉煌成就。
    一年来，和平力量空前壮大，战争势力日益孤立。不久以前，赫鲁晓夫同志对美国的访问和苏联提出的关于全面和彻底裁军的建议，最近苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议就缓和国际紧张局势和裁军问题所通过的告世界各国议会书，都充分地表达了人类要求和平的愿望，对和缓国际紧张局势和维护世界和平再一次作出了巨大的贡献。中国人民对苏联的这些和平倡议，表示完全赞同和支持，并且愿意同苏联人民以及各国人民一道，为其彻底实现而努力。
    在不朽的马克思、列宁的旗帜下，建立在无产阶级国际主义基础之上的中苏团结和友谊，有了空前的巩固和发展。不久前，以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联党政代表团参加我国建国十周年庆典，是对我国人民的莫大鼓舞。在中国人民反对帝国主义的斗争和建设社会主义的事业中，苏联人民一贯给予有力的支持和巨大的援助，对此，中国人民表示衷心的感谢。中国人民将继续为加强我们两国人民之间的友谊和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和友谊而努力。
    我们预祝你们和全体苏联人民在共产主义建设和争取世界持久和平的斗争中取得新的更大的成就！
    伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！
    中苏两国人民永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结万岁！
                  中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东
                    中华人民共和国主席刘少奇
        中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长 朱德
                  中华人民共和国国务院总理  周恩来
                        一九五九年十一月六日于北京
    新华社6日讯　中华人民共和国外交部长陈毅6日打电报给苏联外交部长葛罗米柯，祝贺伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年。电报全文如下：苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部长安·安·葛罗米柯同志：
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年的时候，我谨向你致以热烈的兄弟的祝贺。伟大的苏联是捍卫世界和平和维护人类进步的强大堡垒。苏联政府为世界和平事业所作的重大努力受到了全世界爱好和平国家和人民的热烈赞扬和普遍支持。我衷心地祝你在执行苏联政府的和平外交政策的事业中获得新的更大的成就。
                     中华人民共和国外交部长　陈毅
                             一九五九年十一月六日
