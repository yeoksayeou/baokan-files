    One Mu of Land, One Pig: Abundant Fertilizer, Bountiful Grain
    A Production Team in the Longtou Commune Increases Grain Production by 35%, Income from Pig Raising Accounts for 36.4% of Total Income
    Yushan County, Jiangxi Province, Emphasizes Pig Raising and Manure Accumulation, Pig Pens and Fences Prevent Fertilizer Loss
    According to a report in the Shaanxi Daily, the Second Team of the Xinxing Production Team in Chenggu County's Longtou People's Commune has seen rapid development in pig raising since communization. Now, on average, there is more than one pig per mu of land.
    This team consists of thirty-two households, one hundred and sixty-three people, fifty-nine laborers, and two hundred and ninety-three mu of cultivated land, averaging 1.8 mu per person. In the initial stage of communization, this team raised sixty-eight pigs. After a year, the number of pigs raised reached four hundred and ninety-six. After selling one hundred and sixty-eight to the state, supporting fraternal teams, and for the members' own consumption, there are currently three hundred and twenty-eight pigs (two hundred and fifty-one collectively raised and seventy-seven privately raised), averaging 10.3 pigs per household, two pigs per person, and 1.1 pigs per mu. The plan of "one pig per mu" has been realized.
    After communization, the team had high production enthusiasm and wanted to rapidly increase grain production, but lacked fertilizer. The Party branch decided to vigorously raise pigs and launched a propaganda and education campaign among the members. Initially, some members said: "We don't have money to buy pigs, there won't be enough feed if there are too many pigs, and pig cholera is difficult to prevent." Some feeders said: "Feeding pigs is dirty, smelly, and troublesome." Some cadres said: "Raising pigs is a good thing, but we are afraid of losing money and delaying production."
    In response to the above concerns, the Party branch, on the one hand, used accounting methods, organized discussions and debates, and publicized the benefits of raising pigs, explaining that difficulties could be overcome, to stimulate the members' enthusiasm for raising pigs; on the other hand, it went deep into each household to understand the situation and solve specific problems. Due to a lack of pig sources, in accordance with the spirit of "self-breeding and self-raising," the principle of "collective feeding as the main method, with both public and private raising simultaneously" was implemented. Scientific methods such as "one selection" (selecting good breeds), "five comprehensives" (comprehensive mating, comprehensive pregnancy, comprehensive production, comprehensive survival, and comprehensive raising), and "three matings" (double mating, continuous mating, and repeated mating) were adopted to breed a large number of piglets. All the piglets born from the original thirty-five sows in the team were sold on credit to the members. Regarding insufficient feed, the members were mobilized to tap the potential of various crop leaves, vines, husks, and skins that could be used to make feed. They also used vacant land, ponds, and reservoirs to grow vegetables and aquatic forage, and collected various wild grasses from the mountains. This completely solved the feed shortage.
    In terms of feeding management, the methods of "six fixings" (fixing the number, fixing the weight, fixing the time, fixing the cost, fixing work points, fixing personnel), "three guarantees" (guaranteeing work, guaranteeing output, guaranteeing feed), and "one reward" (over-production incentive reward), and the feeding management methods of "timing, quantity, frequent additions, and small feeds," "six cleanness" (clean pens, clean troughs, clean grass, clean feed, clean water, clean pigs), and "four knowledges" (knowing hunger, knowing fullness, knowing heat, knowing cold) were implemented, giving play to the enthusiasm of the members and feeders and improving the quality of pig raising.
    In terms of preventing pig epidemics, the principle of prevention first was implemented, and comprehensive epidemic prevention methods were adopted, including carrying out the "white circle" movement (i.e., whitewash disinfection) and regularly cleaning the pens. For example, in June of this year, before pig cholera appeared, the entire team launched a preventive immunization campaign and mobilized members to collect more than twenty kinds of herbal medicines, effectively controlling the occurrence of pig cholera.
    In order to facilitate the members' private pig raising, without affecting collective production, a certain amount of time was left for the members to freely arrange, resolving the contradiction between individual and collective labor.
    The rapid development of pig raising has increased the income of the team and its members and promoted agricultural production. In 1959, the application of pig manure increased by 1.6 times compared to 1958, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu increased from 60 dan (80 jin per dan) last year to 120 dan this year, increasing the yield per unit area of grain crops. Although the autumn crops this year suffered a relatively severe drought, they still grew stronger than last year. It is estimated that the average yield per mu of autumn and summer crops this year will increase by 35% compared to last year. In terms of net income from pig raising, the team earned more than 2,700 yuan in the first half of the year alone, accounting for 36.4% of the total income from agricultural and sideline occupations in the first half of the year. The funds used to expand reproduction increased. For example, more than 1,100 yuan from pig raising income was used to buy back more than 70 pieces of agricultural equipment. The income of the members also increased, and sixteen households in the team repaid 192 yuan in overdraft payments.
    Encouraged by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the cadres and members of the entire team are full of energy and have proposed to fight hard in the fourth quarter and launch another great leap forward in pig raising. It is planned to raise 590 pigs by the end of the year. After selling and consuming, the number of pigs in stock will reach 434, averaging 1.5 pigs per mu. Twenty new pig pens will be built to expand the number of publicly raised pigs. Currently, a campaign to collect and store green fodder has been launched, and melons and vegetables are being planted on scattered vacant plots around houses, field ridges, field edges, plough ditches, and roadsides, with each household reaching 100 melon vines. One million one hundred thousand jin of feed have already been collected and stored. By the end of the year, another 320,000 dan of pig manure can be accumulated, ensuring the realization of the grain overproduction plan.
    Xinhua News Agency, --Yushan County, Jiangxi Province, has historically earned more than 40% of its total agricultural income from hog production. Currently, the county has 220,000 pigs, an average of 3.8 pigs per household.
    More pigs mean more fertilizer and greater agricultural output. The county’s 310,000 mu of paddy fields now receive an average application of fertilizer that is double the amount from the same period last year. This year, the county's spring harvest crops had a per-mu yield 20% higher than last year; the total output of early rice was 11.2% higher than last year; and the output of late rice is expected to exceed that of early rice.
    Yushan County pays great attention to the work of raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer. This year, pigs are kept in pens, and the dirt floors of the pens have been replaced with hard floors made of a mixture of soil, sand, and lime to prevent fertilizer loss. Each pig farm has established a manure accumulation quota for its feeders, and feeders are paid 60% (converted to work points) of the value of the over-quota manure, greatly strengthening the feeders' sense of responsibility for manure accumulation. The commune and production team purchase pig manure from pigs raised by commune members at a reasonable price; commune members who accumulate a lot of fertilizer are commended or given material rewards.
    Another method used by Yushan County to promote pig raising and fertilizer accumulation is to rationally arrange the location of pig farms, especially to establish pig farms next to distant fields and barren fields. This saves a large amount of labor for transporting fertilizer and transforms low-yield fields. (Liu Guanghui, Mei Guobao)

    一亩地一头猪肥足粮丰
    龙头公社一个小队粮食增35％养猪收入占总收入36.4％
    江西玉山县重视养猪积肥工作猪猪圈栏防止肥料流失
    据陕西日报报道　城固县龙头人民公社新兴生产队第二小队，公社化以后，养猪事业发展很快，现在平均一亩地有猪一头多。
    这个小队，共三十二户，一百六十三人，五十九个劳动力，二百九十三亩耕地，每人平均一点八亩。公社化初期，这个队养猪六十八头，经过一年时间，喂养的猪曾经达到四百九十六头，除出售给国家、支援兄弟队和社员自食一百六十八头外，现在实际存栏三百二十八头（其中公养二百五十一头，社员私养七十七头），每户平均有十点三头，每人平均有二头，每亩地平均有一点一头。实现了“一亩地养一头猪”的计划。
    这个小队在公社化后，生产情绪很高，想迅速提高粮食产量，只是肥料缺乏。党支部决定大力养猪，随即在社员中开展了宣传教育活动。开始，有些社员说：“买猪没钱，猪多了没饲料，尤其是猪瘟难防”，有些饲养员说：“喂猪这事又脏、又臭、又麻烦”；部分干部说：“养猪是好事，就是怕赔本，耽误生产。”
    针对上述思想顾虑，党支部一方面采用算账方法，组织鸣放辩论，宣传养猪的好处，说明困难可以克服，以激发社员养猪的积极性；一方面深入每户了解情况，解决具体问题。猪源缺乏，根据“自繁自养”精神，贯彻了“集体喂养为主，公养私养同时并举”的方针，采用“一选”（选良种）、“五全”（全配、全怀、全产、全活、全养）、“三配种”（双重配、连环配、复配）的科学办法，大量繁殖仔猪，将队内原有的三十五头母猪所生的仔猪，全部赊给社员。饲料不足，发动社员挖掘各种作物的叶、蔓、糠、皮等可制作饲料的潜力，利用空闲地、水塘、水库种植蔬菜和水生饲草，以及上山采集各种野草。这样，彻底解决了饲料困难。
    饲养管理方面，实行了“六定”（定头数、定重量、定时间、定成本、定工分、定人员）、“三包”（包工、包产、包饲料）、“一奖励”（超产提成奖励）的办法，和“定时、定量、勤添、少喂”、“六净”（圈净、槽净、草净、料净、水净、猪身净）、“四知”（知饥、知饱、知热、知冷）的饲养管理方法，发挥了社员、饲养人员的积极性，提高了养猪质量。
    在防治猪疫方面，贯彻执行了预防为主的方针，实行了综合性的防疫办法，开展“白圈”运动（即白灰消毒），定期清圈。如今年6月，猪瘟未露头以前，全队即开展了预防性的防疫注射运动，并发动社员采集了二十多种草药，有效地控制了猪瘟的发生。
    为了照顾社员私人养猪方便，在不影响集体生产的原则下，还给社员留有一定的时间，让社员自由支配，解决了社员个人和集体劳动之间的矛盾。
    养猪事业的迅速发展，增加了队和社员的收入，促进了农业增产。1959年施猪肥比1958年增加了一点六倍，每亩地的施肥量由去年的六十担（每担八十斤），到今年增为一百二十担，提高了粮食作物的单位面积产量。今年秋田作物，虽然遭受较重的干旱袭击，但仍比去年生长得健壮。预计今年秋夏作物平均亩产将比去年增长35％。在养猪纯收入方面，仅上半年即收入二千七百多元，占到上半年农副业总收入的36.4％。用于扩大再生产的资金增加了，如用养猪收入一千一百多元，买回农具七十多件。社员收入也增加了，全队有十六户社员清还了超支款一百九十二元。
    在党的八届八中全会精神鼓舞下，全队干部、社员干劲冲天，提出大战第四季度，再来一个养猪大跃进，计划到年底养猪五百九十头，除出售、自食外，存栏猪数达到四百三十四头，每亩地平均有一点五头，再修建二十个新猪圈，扩大公养猪数。目前已开展了收贮青饲草运动，并利用房屋周围、地畔、田坎、犁沟、路边等零星空闲地块种植瓜菜，户户达到百窝瓜，现在已经收贮饲料一百一十万斤。到年底可再积猪肥三十二万担，保证实现粮食超产计划。
    本报讯　江西省玉山县历年生猪生产收入占农业总收入的40％以上。目前，全县养猪二十二万头，平均每户养猪三点八头。
    猪多肥足，农业增产。全县三十一万亩水田平均施肥量比去年同期多一倍。今年全县春收作物的亩产量比去年增长20％；早稻总产量比去年增长11.2％；晚稻产量预计可超过早稻。
    玉山县很注意养猪积肥的工作。今年实现了猪猪圈栏，还把土底栏改用三合土砌成硬底，防止了肥料流失。各养猪场制定了饲养员积肥定额，超产肥料按超产部分的60％（折合工分）发给饲养员，大大加强了饲养员积肥的责任心。社员饲养的猪，公社、生产队合理作价收买猪肥；对积肥多的社员，给予表扬或物质奖励。
    玉山县抓养猪积肥的另一个办法是，合理摆布养猪场址，特别是在远田、瘦田旁边建立养猪场。这样就节约了大批运肥劳力，改造了低产田。　（刘光辉、梅国宝）
