    Masses in Thirteen Provinces Basically Overcome Autumn Drought
    Drought-affected area of 60 million mu, drought relieved in most areas except parts of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian
    Autumn sowing in drought-affected areas faster and better than last year, late autumn harvests in the south also secured
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Since late October, widespread autumn rains have fallen in the vast areas south of the Yellow River in our country, and the drought has been basically relieved in most of the areas affected by autumn drought, while the drought has been alleviated in some areas. The people's communes in the drought-affected areas, under the leadership of the Party, have overcome the drought, and this year's autumn sowing is faster and better than last year's, and the late rice harvest in the south has been guaranteed.
    Since the beginning of October, extensive areas in central and southern China have experienced varying degrees of autumn drought following the summer drought. The drought-affected areas cover thirteen provinces and regions, including Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Shanxi, and Shaanxi. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture (lacking figures from Hubei, Shaanxi, and Guizhou), the drought-affected area in these regions reached over 60 million mu at its peak. The drought situation was most severe in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. Henan Province had the largest drought-affected area.
    The provinces and regions that experienced autumn drought had been short of rain since July this year, and the midsummer drought was very severe. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture in mid-August, the cumulative drought-affected area in sixteen provinces and regions nationwide this summer reached 320 million mu, of which the thirteen provinces and regions of Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Guizhou, Shanxi, and Shaanxi accounted for nearly 300 million mu. The drought lasted the longest and was most severe in Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and central and southern Shaanxi, generally lasting for about three months until several rains fell in late September, and the drought was basically relieved. However, in some areas of these thirteen provinces and regions, the rain did not soak through, and other areas had little rain in October, causing these areas to continue to suffer from about a month of autumn drought after the summer drought.
    It was not until late October that rainfall became widespread in the drought-affected areas of our country. Since late October, there have been two rains in the vast areas of central China. The rainfall from October 29 to November 2 covered a larger area, including the area south of the Yellow River and north of the Nanling and Wuyi Mountains. Except for the lower reaches of the Huai River and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, where the rainfall was less, the rainfall in other areas generally exceeded 25 millimeters. Hunan and Jiangxi had the most rainfall, generally reaching 50 to 80 millimeters. By this point, the drought in most areas of central China had been basically relieved or alleviated. However, due to little or no rain in parts of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, the drought situation is still developing.
    This year's autumn drought has severely threatened the sowing and emergence of winter wheat and rapeseed in the north, and the growth of late rice, corn, sweet potatoes and other crops in the south. In many drought-affected areas, it was difficult to cultivate the land, and some of the crops that had been sown did not emerge fully. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn grain crops this year and to ensure the continued leap forward in agricultural production next year, all drought-affected areas have successively launched mass movements centered on fighting drought to rush-plant and fighting drought to protect seedlings and harvests. All localities have used the rich experience of this summer's drought-fighting struggle, given full play to the great role of the large number of water conservancy projects built since the Great Leap Forward last year, and mobilized the masses to vigorously fight drought, ensuring that autumn sowing is fast and of good quality. Under the leadership of the Party, the people's communes in the main wheat-producing areas of northern China, such as Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, have given full play to the superiority of the people's communes, organized manpower, animal power, and irrigation and drainage machinery to fight drought and rush-plant wheat. Before the Frost's Descent (October 24), the vast majority of the winter wheat planned to be sown in these four provinces had been sown in a timely manner. Henan Province, which has the largest drought-affected area, mobilized more than 20 million laborers throughout the province to carry out large-scale cooperation, evaluation, visits, and competitions to ensure that wheat was sown even without rain. Not only was the timely sowing of winter wheat guaranteed, but the sowing task was also overfulfilled. Last year, Henan Province only completed 77% of the wheat sowing task before the Frost's Descent, while this year it had completed 98% of the wheat sowing task before the Frost's Descent, which is much faster than last year. By the end of October, the wheat sowing task had been completed by 103%, greatly exceeding last year. Late autumn crops in the south have also achieved a bumper harvest in the fight against drought. In order to win a bumper harvest of late rice, Guangdong Province mobilized two million people to fight the drought. In order to ensure that not a single mu of land was abandoned, the Foshan Special District organized several relays of water carts in areas without water sources, and even carried water for irrigation. By late October, more than 5 million mu of the 7 million mu of drought-affected farmland in Guangdong Province had been irrigated. At present, a bumper harvest of late rice in the province is a certainty. In some coastal areas of Fujian Province, which had been without rain for more than a month, many people's communes rose up to fight the drought. The Jinjiang Special District mobilized more than 90,000 people, irrigating the fields day and night, with people staying with the carts. Many commune members put forward the slogans "exchange sweat for water, exchange water for grain" and "fight drought wherever it occurs". Jinjiang County has rush-repaired more than 360 channels and small-scale water conservancy projects, irrigating 25,000 mu of dry land, and has also planted wheat ahead of schedule.
    This rainfall is extremely beneficial to the emergence and replanting of wheat in the north, the emergence of rapeseed, and the winter planting in the south. All drought-affected areas have organized a large number of laborers to seize the opportunity to rush-plant and replant. Some areas in Anhui Province have launched a surge of rush-planting. The Bengbu Special District has mobilized more than one million laborers and organized 35,000 specialized rush-planting teams, which have rushed to plant 360,000 mu of winter wheat. The people's communes in Hubei Province, which has been severely affected by drought, are also confidently seizing the opportunity to rush-plow and rush-plant in order to strive for a bumper harvest next year.

    充分发挥人民公社和水利建设的巨大作用
    十三省群众基本战胜秋旱
    受旱面积六千万亩，除粤、桂、闽部分地区外，已解除旱象
    受旱地区秋播比去年进度快质量好，南方晚秋也保住丰收
    新华社6日讯　10月下旬以来，我国黄河流域以南广大地区喜降秋雨，发生秋旱的大部分地区旱象已经基本解除，部分地区旱象得到缓和。受旱地区的人民公社，在党的领导下，战胜了干旱，今年秋播比去年的进度快、质量好，而且保证了南方晚稻得到丰收。
    9月底、10月初以来，我国中部和南部广大地区继夏旱之后又发生了不同程度的秋旱。受旱地区遍及山东、河南、安徽、江苏、湖北、湖南、江西、福建、广东、广西、贵州、山西、陕西等十三个省区。据农业部不完全统计（缺湖北、陕西、贵州三个省的数字），这些地区受旱面积最高时曾达六千多万亩。旱情以河南、湖北、安徽三省为最重。受旱面积以河南省为最大。
    发生秋旱的省区，今年7月以来就缺雨，伏期干旱很严重。据农业部8月中旬的统计，今年夏季全国十六个省区累积受旱面积曾达三亿二千万亩，其中山东、河南、江苏、安徽、江西、湖南、湖北、广东、广西、福建、贵州、山西、陕西等十三个省区占了近三亿亩。河南、湖北、安徽、陕西中部和南部等地的干旱时间最长，旱情最严重，旱象一般持续了约三个月左右之久，直到9月下旬降过几次雨后旱象才算基本解除。但是这十三个省区有些地区雨没有下透，有些地区10月份又少雨，致使这些地区夏旱之后又继续遭到一个月左右的秋旱。
    直到10月下旬，我国受旱地区才普遍降雨。10月下旬以来我国中部广大地区降了两次雨。以10月29日到11月2日一次降雨范围较大，包括了黄河以南、南岭武夷山以北的地区。两次降雨除淮河下游、长江下游雨量较少外，其他地区降雨量普遍在二十五毫米以上。湖南、江西降雨最多，一般达五十毫米到八十毫米。至此，我国中部大部分地区旱象已基本解除，或得到了缓和。但广东、广西、福建的一部分地区因为少雨或无雨，旱情仍在发展。
    今年的秋旱，使北方冬小麦、油菜的播种、出苗，南方晚稻、玉米、甘薯等作物的生长，都受到了严重的威胁。受旱地区有不少土地耕种困难，还有些已种的庄稼出苗不全。为了争取今年秋季粮食作物的丰收和保证明年农业生产的继续跃进，各受旱地区都先后开展了以抗旱抢种和抗旱保苗、保收为中心的群众运动。各地运用今年夏季抗旱斗争的丰富经验，充分发挥去年大跃进以来兴修的大量水利工程的巨大作用，发动群众大力抗旱，保证了秋播进度快、质量好。我国北方主要产麦区河南、山东、山西、陕西等省的人民公社在党的领导下，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，组织人力、畜力、排灌机械进行抗旱抢种小麦，到霜降（10月24日）前，这四个省计划播种的冬麦，绝大部分已经适时播完。受旱面积最大的河南省，为了保证无雨也要种下小麦，全省各地出动了二千多万劳力，大搞协作、评比、参观、竞赛，不仅保证了冬麦的适时播种，还超额完成了播种任务。去年河南省在霜降前只完成播麦任务的77％，而今年在霜降前已完成播麦任务的98％，进度比去年快得多。到10月底，播麦任务已完成了103％，大大超过了去年。南方晚秋作物，在抗旱中也获得丰收。广东省为了夺取晚稻大丰收，全省曾出动二百万人与干旱斗争。佛山专区为了做到一亩田也不放弃，没有水源的地区组织几递水车，甚至担水进行浇灌。到10月下旬广东全省的七百多万亩受旱农田有五百多万亩已经得到灌溉。目前，全省晚稻丰收已成定局。有一个多月无雨的福建省沿海部分地区，许多人民公社奋起向干旱斗争。晋江专区出动了九万多人，人不离车地日夜灌田，许多社员提出了“用汗换水、用水换粮”、“旱到哪里抗到哪里”的口号。晋江县已抢修渠道和小型水利工程三百六十多处，使二万五千亩旱地得到灌溉，还提早种上了小麦。
    这次降雨对北方的小麦出苗、补种、油菜的出苗以及南方的冬种极为有利。各受旱地区雨后都组织大批劳力趁墒抢种补种。安徽省有些地区已掀起了抢种高潮，蚌埠专区出动了一百多万劳力，组织了三万五千个抢种专业队，已抢种冬小麦等三十六万亩。受旱严重的湖北省各地人民公社，当前也正满怀信心地趁雨突击抢耕抢种，争取明年丰收。
