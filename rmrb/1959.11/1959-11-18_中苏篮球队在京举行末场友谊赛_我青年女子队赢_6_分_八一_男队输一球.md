Xinhua News Agency, 17th - The Soviet National Youth Men's and Women's Basketball Teams held friendly matches in Beijing tonight with the "August 1st" Men's Basketball Team and the Chinese Youth Women's Basketball Team. The result was a win for the men and a loss for the women. The score for the men's teams was 65 to 63; for the women's teams, it was 54 to 60. This is the first victory for the visiting men's team in our country, and the first defeat for the women's team.

The two friendly matches were tense and fierce. The wonderful performances of the basketball players from both countries frequently drew thunderous applause and cheers from the more than six thousand spectators in the Beijing Gymnasium. In the men's match, the visiting team, with two seconds left, was able to decide the outcome when the agile 2.01-meter-tall player Valtin (No. 4) scored a basket. In the women's match, the Chinese team, which had been behind in points, only began to turn defeat into victory when it timely adopted a full-court press man-to-man defense with ten minutes remaining in the match, maintaining the lead until the end.

The visiting men's team started today with a brand-new lineup. The tallest player, Lezhava (No. 10), and key players Valtin (No. 4), Mosheshvili (No. 5), and Travin (No. 9) did not play. Instead, Khazaradze (No. 7), who is 2.02 meters tall, and Uglikhkhlize (No. 12), who has excellent jumping ability, were active under the basket. Captain Ozer (No. 6), Borodin (No. 3), Astakhov (No. 8), and others shot mid-range baskets or cut in for layups. The "August 1st" team strived for fast breaks or used screens to shoot. Lu Lianhan, Qian Chenghai, Cai Jijie, Fu Ruide, and others scored continuously. In the first ten minutes, the score was tied six times, from 2-2 to 19-19. After the "August 1st" team took a 21-19 lead, the visiting team replaced three main players, including the 23-year-old, 2.08-meter-tall giant Lezhava, increasing the average height of the entire team. The situation began to change, and there were three more ties—21-21, 23-23, and 25-25. After that, the visiting team consistently led, with the score at the end of the first half being 33-30.

In the second half, the "August 1st" team included the agile and fast Qian Chenghai, Yang Boyong, Lu Lianhan, and others, who repeatedly cut in for layups, finally tying the score for the tenth time with fourteen seconds remaining in the match. At that time, Astakhov, who had just been substituted in for the visiting team, committed a foul. Zhang Fukui of the home team only made one of two free throws, bringing the score to 63-63. The visiting team passed the ball inbounds to attack, and Valtin seized the last opportunity to score the decisive basket, drawing applause from the audience.

The Chinese Youth Women's Basketball Team won hard today. In the first half, both sides missed many shots, and the score rose very slowly. The visiting team had a high free throw percentage and maintained a lead, ending the first half with a score of 27-24.

In the second half, the home team tried to launch fast breaks. Newcomer Li Shihua and Li Shaofen, Yang Jie, Wang Xiafei, and others repeatedly broke through the visiting team's defense, cutting in for layups or making mid- and close-range shots. When the score reached 40-44, the home team substituted in the fast-running Ma Shenmei and Hu Yingxin, and began to play a full-court press man-to-man tactic, and the situation began to change. Soon, the home team took the lead for the first time with a score of 46-45. When the score reached 56-49, the visiting team also began to use a full-court man-to-man tactic. At this time, the competition reached its climax. When the visiting team's key player Ottsa (No. 6) left the court due to five fouls, and the 1.98-meter-tall Salimova played for the first time, the home team remained steady and finally won.

    中苏篮球队在京举行末场友谊赛
    我青年女子队赢6分“八一”男队输一球
    据新华社17日讯　苏联国家青年男、女篮球队今晚在北京同“八一”男子篮球队和中国青年女子篮球队举行友谊比赛，结果男胜女败。男子队的比数是六十五比六十三；女子队是五十四比六十。这是客队男子队在我国第一次获胜，女子队第一次失利。
    两场友谊比赛紧张、激烈，两国篮球选手的精采表演，不时博得北京体育馆比赛馆里六千多名观众雷鸣般的掌声和欢呼声。男子队的比赛，客队是在最后两秒钟时由身高两米零一、动作灵活的队员瓦尔京（4号）在篮下投入一球，才决定胜负的。女子队的比赛，原来得分一直落后的中国队在全场比赛还剩十分钟时，由于及时采取了全场紧逼人盯人的防守战术，才开始反败为胜，使得分一直领先到终场。
    客队男子队今天开头排出了崭新的阵容，身材最高的列扎瓦（10号）和主力队员瓦尔京（4号）、莫谢什维利（5号）、特拉文（9号）都没上场，而由身高两米零二的哈扎拉泽（7号）和弹跳力非常好的乌格利赫利泽（12号）在篮下活动，外围由队长奥泽尔斯（6号）、鲍罗丁（3号）、阿斯塔霍夫（8号）等人投中距离篮或切入上篮，“八一”队则力争快攻，或利用掩护的办法投篮，路廉翰、钱澄海、蔡集杰、符瑞德等人连连得分，前十分钟同客队从二平打到十九平共六次平局。打到“八一”队以二十一比十九领先以后，客队把二十三岁、身高两米零八的巨人列扎瓦等三名主力队队员换上场，增加了全队的平均身高，形势开始发生变化，又打了三次平局——二十一平、二十三平、二十五平以后，客队就开始一直领先，上半场结束时的比数是三十三比三十。
    下半场“八一”队上场的队员中包括了灵活快速的钱澄海、杨伯镛、路廉翰等人，多次切入上篮得分，终于在比赛还剩最后十四秒钟时追成第十次平局。当时客队刚换上场的阿斯塔霍夫犯规，主队张福奎两次罚球只命中一次，场上比分六十三平。客队发界外球进攻，瓦尔京掌握最后时机投入了奠定胜利的一球，观众掌声四起。
    中国青年女子篮球队今天赢得艰苦，上半场双方投篮失误较多，比分上升很慢，客队罚球命中率高得分一直领先，上半场结束时客队以二十七比二十四领先。
    下半场主队力图快攻，新手李世华和李少芬、杨洁、王霞飞等人连连突破客队防线切入上篮得分或中、近距离投篮命中，打到四十比四十四时，主队换上了奔跑快速的马申妹、胡英信，开始打全场紧逼人盯人的战术，形势开始发生变化。不一会场上就出现了主队以四十六比四十五第一次领先的局面。打到五十六比四十九时，客队也开始采用全场盯人战术。这时双方争夺达到了高潮。当时客队主力队员奥特萨（6号）五次犯规离场，身高一米九十八的萨利莫娃第一次上场，主队仍稳扎稳打，终于取胜。
