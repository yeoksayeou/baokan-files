Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Soviet scientists and technicians have made outstanding achievements, which shows that Soviet science is at the forefront of world science, demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the great victory of Marxism-Leninism. Guo Moruo said that the scientific and technological achievements of New China in the past ten years have been inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Other fraternal countries have also provided a lot of help to China's scientific undertakings. Guo Moruo called on Chinese scientists and technicians to further learn from the Soviet Union's advanced scientific experience.

Antonov then delivered a speech, saying: The scientific achievements of the Soviet Union are also the achievements of the entire socialist camp, and the scientific achievements of China and other fraternal countries are also the achievements of the socialist camp. Antonov said that our scientific achievements in the socialist camp have increasingly enhanced our international prestige.

The head of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences delegation, Mátyás Major, also spoke at the meeting.

Among those present were Zhang Jingfu and Wu Youxun, Vice Presidents of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and well-known Chinese scientists in Beijing.
