Youthful Machines

A loom, used by a weaver, maintained by a maintenance worker, and repaired by a maintenance technician, with usage and maintenance separated—this was once considered perfectly normal. Now, the workers of the Tianjin Second Textile Factory are "three-in-one," working together, combining the professional maintenance team with the broad masses of workers, emphasizing both routine maintenance and regular overhauls. The result is that the machines remain "youthful" and production has increased across the board. This is a good experience and worth promoting.

Machine maintenance should be a continuous process, implementing a "prevention first" policy. Maintaining and caring for machinery and equipment well on a daily basis, preventing problems or minimizing them, is not only more labor-saving and material-saving than repairing machines after they break down, but it can also extend the service life of the machinery and equipment. Those who deal with machines most frequently are the direct production workers. Therefore, in addition to professional maintenance personnel, the users should also be duty-bound to maintain and care for the machinery and equipment. This is a requirement of production; a requirement of the machines; and also a conscious requirement of highly conscious production workers.

With the continuous leap forward in production, regular equipment maintenance and upkeep is becoming even more important. We hope that production workers in all factories will work closely with maintenance workers to ensure that all our machines remain "youthful"!

    青春长在
    一台织布机，由挡车工使用，保养工保养，保全工检修，使用与维修分家，过去被人认为理所当然。而今，天津第二纺织厂工人“三位一体”，齐心合力，专业维修队伍与广大职工结合起来，使日常维护和定期检修并重，结果使机器“青春长在”，生产全面上升。这是一个好经验，值得推广。
    机器的维修应该是经常性的，贯彻预防为主的方针。日常把机器设备维护保养好，不让它出毛病，或者少出毛病，既比机器坏了再修理要省工省料，还可以延长机器设备的使用寿命。经常和机器打交道的是直接生产的工人，因此，除了专业维修人员外，使用者也维护保养机器设备，应该是责无旁贷的。这是生产的要求；机器的要求，也是有高度觉悟的生产工人的自觉要求。
    随着生产的不断跃进，经常性的设备维修和保养工作也更加重要了。我们希望所有工厂的生产工人都与维修工人通力合作，让我们所有的机器都“青春长在”！
