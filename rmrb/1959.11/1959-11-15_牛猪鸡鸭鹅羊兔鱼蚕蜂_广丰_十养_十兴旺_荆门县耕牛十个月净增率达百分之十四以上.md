Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 14th – Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province, vigorously developed the "ten breedings" undertaking of cattle, pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, goats, fish, rabbits, silkworms, and bees, which quickly developed poultry and livestock. By October, the number of pigs in the county had increased from more than 38,000 in April to more than 100,000, an increase of more than 150 percent; cattle increased from the original 26,500 to 31,492, an increase of 18.8%; chickens increased 4.18 times, an average of 11.5 per household; geese increased 1.8 times; ducks increased 2.9 times; goats increased from the original 13,000 to more than 27,000; domestic rabbits increased nearly two times; fresh fish increased 49.8%, and bees increased nearly one time. The development of the "ten breedings" undertaking provided a large amount of animal power and fertilizer for agricultural production; supported the needs of urban industrial and mining people for non-staple foods, and further deepened the relationship between urban and rural areas. The income of commune members has also greatly increased. In addition to the large income from livestock and poultry, the Jinxing Brigade of the Dashigong Commune alone harvested 580 catties of cocoons from raising only eight silkworm seed sheets, earning 1,033 yuan. The Lin Xianrui team of the Wuli Brigade of the Hebei Commune used more than one mu of paddy fields to raise 5,000 fish fry, earning more than 1,000 yuan.

In the county's development of the "ten breedings" undertaking, a "five competitions" campaign was launched between communes, brigades, and production teams, namely, comparing the number of poultry and livestock, comparing the speed of poultry and livestock development, comparing full matching, full pregnancy, full birth, full survival, and full strength, comparing feeding management, and comparing disease prevention. From the county party committee to the grassroots party branches, there was a secretary who personally grasped this work, established organizational structures at all levels, and often organized working groups to go deep into various places to mobilize the masses for inspection and comparison. For example, when the county party committee discovered that the "ten breedings" work of the Danan Commune was doing well, it held an on-site meeting in this commune, organized personnel from various communes and reclamation farms in the county to visit, and launched a competition to "learn from Danan, catch up with Danan, and surpass Danan." After visiting and learning, the Dashi Commune launched a "five competitions" campaign between teams and groups, and the number of pigs raised rapidly increased from the original 3,017 to 6,194.

Due to the large-scale mass movement, problems such as feed, seed sources, and disease prevention were also solved. If there was insufficient feed, the masses tried every means to use vacant land to grow high-yield feed and vigorously cultivate water hyacinth and water hyacinth. The Hengshan Commune also mobilized auxiliary labor to collect a large amount of green fodder. If there were insufficient seed sources, all the newborn female piglets were not castrated and were kept as seed sows. As much as possible, seed eggs were eaten less or not at all, and were left to hatch poultry. The launch of mass health and epidemic prevention activities has also greatly reduced livestock and poultry diseases.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 14th – Hubei Jingmen County has seen great development in cattle this year. By the end of October, the county's cattle net increase was 10,461, with a net increase rate reaching 14.58%. This greatly alleviated the contradiction of labor shortage and played an important role in completing the autumn plowing and planting work.

The main experiences of Jingmen County's rapid development of cattle are: the Party committee attaches importance, strengthens leadership, and widely innovates breeding technology. In February of this year, the Jingmen County Party Committee specifically deployed work to promote cattle pregnancy, and later held an on-site meeting in the Hougang Commune, which had done a good job in cattle pregnancy, and organized a large comparison and competition with full matching, full pregnancy, full birth, full survival, and full strength as the content. Nearly 18,000 people in the county participated in the cattle breeding and pregnancy movement, and 795 professional technicians were trained. The county selected 1,977 good breeding bulls, generally established breeding stations and breeding racks, and promoted advanced breeding technologies such as estrus induction, double matching, re-matching, and crossbreeding of buffaloes and yellow cattle, so that more than 900 "chao" cows, which were always considered unable to become pregnant, were also mated by artificial methods.

In terms of cattle feeding management, Jingmen County has designated special personnel to lead and special personnel to feed, with clear requirements and specific responsibilities; and frequently organizes comparisons and inspections, constantly conducts classification and ranking, and takes different fat-boosting measures according to the different conditions of each cow, thereby ensuring the healthy growth of cattle and quickly turning weak cows into strong cows.

    牛猪鸡鸭鹅羊兔鱼蚕蜂
    广丰“十养”十兴旺
    荆门县耕牛十个月净增率达百分之十四以上
    新华社南昌14日电　江西广丰县大力开展耕牛、生猪、鸡、鸭、鹅、山羊、鱼、兔、蚕、蜜蜂等“十养”事业，使家禽家畜等很快发展起来。到10月份，全县生猪已由4月间的三万八千多头增加到十万多头，增加一倍半以上；耕牛由原来的二万六千五百头增加到三万一千四百九十二头，增加18.8％；鸡增加四点一八倍，平均每户十一点五只；鹅增加一点八倍；鸭增加二点九倍；山羊由原来的一万三千多只增加到二万七千多只，家兔增加近二倍；鲜鱼增加49.8％，蜜蜂增加近一倍。“十养”事业的发展，为农业生产提供了大批畜力和肥料；并支援了城市工矿人民对副食品的需要，进一步密切了城乡关系。社员收入也大大增加了。除家畜家禽的大量收入外，大石公社金星大队仅喂养八张蚕种，就收茧五百八十斤，收入一千零三十三元。河北公社五里大队林献瑞小队利用一亩多水田养五千尾鱼苗，就收入一千多元。
    全县在发展“十养”事业中，公社与公社、大队与大队、生产队与生产队之间掀起了“五比”竞赛，即比家禽家畜数量，比家禽家畜发展速度，比全配、全准、全生、全活、全壮，比饲养管理，比疾病防疫。从县委到基层党支部都有一名书记亲自抓这项工作，层层建立组织机构，并经常组织工作组深入各地发动群众检查评比。例如县委发现大南公社“十养”工作搞得好，就在这个社召开现场会议，组织全县各公社、垦殖场人员参观，展开“学大南、赶大南、超大南”的竞赛。大石公社参观学习后，全社展开了队与队、组与组的“五比”竞赛，生猪饲养头数迅速由原来的三千零一十七头增加到六千一百九十四头。
    由于大搞群众运动，饲料、种源、防疫等问题也解决了。饲料不足，群众就千方百计利用空地种高产饲料，大力培植水浮莲、水葫芦。横山公社并发动辅助劳力采集了大批青饲料。种源不足，生下来的小母猪就一律不阉割，留作种母猪。尽量少吃或不吃种蛋，留下孵家禽。开展了群众性的卫生防疫活动，也使家畜家禽病疫大大减少。
    据新华社武汉14日电　湖北荆门县今年耕牛有了很大发展。到10月底，全县耕牛净增一万零四百六十一头，净增率达到了14.58％。大大缓和了劳力不足的矛盾，对完成秋耕秋种工作，起了重要作用。
    荆门县耕牛迅速发展的主要经验是：党委重视，加强领导，广泛革新配种技术。中共荆门县委今年2月专门布置了促使耕牛满怀的工作，以后又在耕牛满怀工作较好的后港公社召开现场会，组织以全配、全怀、全生、全活、全壮为内容的大评比，大竞赛。全县有近一万八千人参加了耕牛配种满怀运动，培养出专业技术人员七百九十五人。全县选择好种牛一千九百七十七头，普遍建立起配种站、配种架，推广催情、双配、重配、水牛黄牛杂交等先进配种技术，使一贯被认为不能怀胎的九百多头“耖”母牛，经过人工办法也配上了种。
    在耕牛饲养管理方面，荆门县确定专人领导，专人饲养，要求明确，责任具体；并且经常组织评比检查，不断进行分类排队，根据每头牛的不同情况，分别采取不同的提膘壮膘措施，从而保证了耕牛的健壮成长，使弱牛很快地变成壮牛。
