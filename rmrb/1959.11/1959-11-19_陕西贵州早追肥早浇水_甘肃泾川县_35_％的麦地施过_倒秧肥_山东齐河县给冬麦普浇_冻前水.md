Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, November 17th: Winter crops in Shaanxi Province have generally emerged, and a field management campaign focusing on topdressing, winter irrigation, winter hoeing, and prevention of rust, pests, bird damage, and winter drought has been launched. As of November 8th, over 1.2 million mu of wheat fields in the province have been topdressed, over 2 million mu have been harrowed and rolled, over 156,000 mu have been treated for wheat rust, and over 70,000 mu have been winter irrigated. After discovering wheat rust, Fengxiang County immediately adopted the method of "dividing areas for responsibility, setting up defenses block by block, preventing rust without rust, and resolutely fighting rust if it exists," organizing more than 35,000 people into 2,567 shock teams, self-producing more than 400,000 jin of indigenous pesticides, and treating more than 114,000 mu of wheat rust in five days. In order to prevent lodging from now on, Pucheng County has already applied more than 600,000 jin of plant ash to 16,100 mu of wheat fields.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, November 17th: As of early November, 50% of the winter crops in Guizhou Province have undergone the first round of weeding, topdressing, seedling replanting, and seedling thinning.

After the sowing of winter crops in various parts of Guizhou, Party committees at all levels organized inspection teams to conduct thorough field surveys and mobilize commune members to carry out field management work. Under the promotion of the inspection teams, generally 20% of the labor force has been arranged to strengthen field management. People's communes in the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture have generally established a field management responsibility system. In early November, the communes in the Tongren Special District transferred 69,000 people to form professional field management teams to universally topdress winter crops and begin weeding wheat and rapeseed. The communes in Suiyang County, Zunyi Special District, have more than 70,000 professional teams, which, under the unified command of the field headquarters, carry out surprise attacks on dams, fields, and slopes, generally improving the efficiency of field management.

This newspaper reports: Jingchuan County, Gansu, grasped field management this year after winter wheat was sown. Encouraged by the slogan of "manage early, manage well, manage skillfully" put forward by the county party committee, the people of the county, in the spirit of not giving up a step, not missing a move, not delaying a moment, and continuous revolution, launched an early processing and management campaign for wheat.

The early processing and management of wheat in Jingchuan County emphasizes "fertilizer as the commander," implementing skillful fertilization, early fertilization, and good fertilization, so that wheat can survive the winter well. There are two methods of fertilization: applying more reversal seedling fertilizer before "Start of Winter" and universally applying warm seedling fertilizer after "Start of Winter." The area where reversal seedling fertilizer has been applied in the county accounts for 35% of the total wheat field area. In order to ensure that the county's wheat is topdressed with warm seedling fertilizer again, production teams and groups are rushing to transport it. Winter weeding, a new thing that has never happened in previous years, has also been carried out this year. A total of more than 200,000 mu have been weeded in the county. In order to ensure sufficient fertilizer and water, the county is vigorously developing farmland water conservancy, focusing on current irrigation, repairing and irrigating at the same time. At present, the irrigated area has reached 19,000 mu. (Bai Zonghui, Wang Zhengwu)

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: Qihe County, Shandong, has grasped winter wheat management early, quickly, and well. At present, over 500,000 mu of wheat in the county have been topdressed once, and 390,000 mu have been watered once.

Qihe County is one of the main wheat-producing areas in northwestern Shandong. In order to ensure that wheat is adequately fertilized and watered to pass the rooting stage well, the Qihe County Party Committee organized more than 50,000 water conservancy troops after the autumn sowing, clearing ditches and repairing canals in the wheat fields with water, and organizing irrigation systems, while vigorously excavating new water sources for wheat fields without water, to water the wheat before the freeze. During the two fertilizer accumulation shock weeks, fertilizer accumulation professional teams and the broad masses of commune members also rushed to accumulate more than 5 billion jin of coarse manure fertilizer for winter wheat. The more than 1,000 indigenous fertilizer plants run by the people's communes produced "refined grains" for wheat production. On this basis, the county's wheat field management professional teams worked day and night in the fields, diverting water, topdressing, checking and replanting wheat seedlings, and controlling pests. As a result, of the 120,000 mu of third-class seedlings, 65,000 mu quickly caught up with second-class seedlings, and some even caught up with first-class seedlings.

    陕西贵州早追肥早浇水
    甘肃泾川县35％的麦地施过“倒秧肥”
    山东齐河县给冬麦普浇“冻前水”
    据新华社西安17日电　陕西各地越冬作物普遍出土，以抓追肥、冬灌、冬锄和防锈病、虫害、鸟害、冬旱为主的田间管理运动已经展开。到11月8日止，全省麦田已经追肥一百二十多万亩，耙耱二百多万亩，防治小麦锈病十五万六千多亩，冬灌七万多亩。凤翔县发现小麦锈病后，立即采取“划片包干，块块设防，无锈防备，有锈决战”的办法，组织三万五千多人，编成两千五百六十七个突击组，自制土农药四十万多斤，五天内就防治小麦锈病十一万四千多亩。蒲城县为了从现在起就开始防倒伏，已经给一万六千一百多亩麦田施草木灰六十多万斤。
    新华社贵阳17日电　贵州到11月上旬止，全省已有50％的越冬作物进行了头道除草、追肥、补苗和匀苗工作。
    贵州各地越冬作物播种以后，各级党委便分别组织检查团，深入田间普查，发动社员开展田间管理工作。在检查团的推动下，各地一般都安排20％的劳力加强田间管理。黔南布依族苗族自治州各人民公社，普遍建立了田间管理责任制。铜仁专区各公社在11月上旬抽调六万九千多人，组成田间管理专业队，给越冬作物普遍追施了一道肥料，并开始薅耘小麦、油菜。遵义专区绥阳县各公社共有七万多人的专业队，在各个田间指挥部的统一指挥下，成坝成片成坡地进行突击，使田间管理工效普遍提高。
    本报讯　甘肃泾川县今年冬小麦在播种后就抓了田间管理。全县人民在县委提出的“管早、管好、管巧”的口号鼓舞下，本着一步不让、一着不漏、一时不迟、不断革命的精神，开展了小麦早期加工管理运动。
    泾川县的小麦早期加工管理，强调“以肥为帅”，实行巧施肥、早施肥、施好肥，使小麦过好越冬关。施肥的办法有两种，即“立冬”前多施倒秧肥，“立冬”后普施暖苗肥。全县施倒秧肥的面积已占麦地总面积的35％。为了保证全县小麦再追施一次暖苗肥，各生产队、组正在突击运送。冬前锄草，这是历年没有过的新事情，今年也开展起来了。全县共锄草二十多万亩。为了保证肥饱水足，全县在大搞农田水利的同时，以现灌为主，边修边灌，目前灌溉面积已达一万九千亩。　（白宗辉、王正武）
    据新华社济南电　山东齐河县冬小麦管理工作抓得早、快、好。目前，全县已有五十多万亩小麦追过一次肥，三十九万亩浇过一次水。
    齐河县是鲁西北主要产麦区之一。为了使小麦追足肥，浇足水，过好盘墩关，中共齐河县委在秋种结束后就组织了五万多名水利大军，一面在有水的麦田里清沟修渠，整理灌溉系统，一面给无水的麦田大力开挖新水源，为小麦浇冻前水。积肥专业队和广大社员在两个积肥突击周中，也为冬小麦赶积了五十多亿斤粗粪肥。各人民公社兴办的一千多个土化肥厂，为小麦生产了“细粮”。在此基础上，全县麦田管理专业队，夜以继日地在田间引水、追肥、查补麦苗，除治虫害。使十二万多亩三类苗中，有六万五千亩迅速地赶上二类苗，有的还赶上了一类苗。
