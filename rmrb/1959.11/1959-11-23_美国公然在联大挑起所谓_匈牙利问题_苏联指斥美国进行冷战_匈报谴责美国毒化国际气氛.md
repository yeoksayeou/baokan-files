Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd: According to TASS, New York: The Soviet delegation to the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly issued a statement to the press on November 21st regarding the U.S. attempt to force the UN General Assembly to discuss the so-called "Hungarian Question."

The statement said: On November 20th, the U.S. delegation formally proposed including the so-called "Hungarian Question" on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly. This step by the U.S. delegation bears the characteristics of the worst period of the "Cold War" and can only be regarded as a violation and damage to the spirit of cooperation that has begun to form in relations between countries due to the current easing of international tensions.

The statement said that it is truly regrettable that the U.S. representatives, on the one hand, proclaim their hope for the normalization of international relations, while on the other hand, they take actions that worsen the international situation. In this regard, it is worth noting the fact that the U.S. delegation's proposal to include the so-called "Hungarian Question" on the agenda of the General Assembly came on the very day that the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution on the important issue of complete and thorough disarmament.

The statement concluded by saying that the Soviet delegation believes that any discussion of the fabricated and provocative so-called "Hungarian Question" only benefits those who oppose improving international relations and can only serve the purposes of those who advocate continuing the "Cold War." Therefore, the Soviet delegation hopes to find sufficient healthy forces among the member states of the United Nations to prevent this organization from being used for ignoble purposes that harm the cause of peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 19th: The Hungarian "People's Freedom" newspaper published an article on November 19th, condemning the imperialist bloc for again forcing the so-called "Hungarian Question" to be submitted to the United Nations for discussion.

The article emphasized that a strong, independent Hungary building socialism exists, and the "Hungarian Question" does not exist. The imperialist bloc, by playing with the so-called "Hungarian Question," is attempting to stir up the Cold War and poison the international atmosphere. The United States, by instigating the submission of the non-existent so-called "Hungarian Question" to the United Nations as an urgent task, fully exposes its imperialist true colors.

The "Hungarian National News" and "People's Voice" also pointed out in their commentaries today that the United Nations' discussion of the so-called "Hungarian Question" is a blatant interference in Hungary's internal affairs.

    美国公然在联大挑起所谓“匈牙利问题”
    苏联指斥美国进行冷战
    匈报谴责美国毒化国际气氛
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：出席联合国大会第十四届会议的苏联代表团21日就美国企图强使联合国大会讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”一事对报界发表声明。
    声明说：11月20日美国代表团提出把所谓“匈牙利问题”列入联合国大会议程的正式建议。美国代表团这一步骤带有“冷战”最坏时期的特色，只能被认为是违背和损害由于目前国际紧张局势的和缓在各国关系中开始形成的那种合作精神。
    声明说，有一种情况真令人遗憾，这就是：美国代表一方面宣扬自己希望国际关系正常化，而另一方面却采取使国际形势恶化的行动。在这方面，值得注意的是这样一个事实：美国代表团提出关于把所谓“匈牙利问题”列入大会议程的建议正是联合国大会一致通过关于全面和彻底裁军这样一个重要问题的决议的那一天。
    声明最后说，苏联代表团认为，对捏造的和挑拨性的所谓“匈牙利问题”的任何讨论只是有利于反对改善国际关系的那些人，只能符合主张继续“冷战”的人的目的。因此，苏联代表团希望在联合国会员国中找到足够的健康的力量，来阻止把这个组织利用在不体面的和危害和平事业的目的上。
    新华社布达佩斯19日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”19日发表文章，谴责帝国主义集团又强迫把所谓“匈牙利问题”提交联合国讨论。
    文章强调指出，坚强、独立的建设着社会主义的匈牙利是存在的，而“匈牙利问题”是不存在的。玩弄所谓“匈牙利问题”的帝国主义集团，是企图以此掀起冷战，毒化国际气氛。美国唆使把不存在的所谓“匈牙利问题”当作急迫的任务提交联合国，充分暴露了它的帝国主义的真面目。
    “匈牙利民族报”和“人民之声报”今天也在评论中指出，联合国讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”是对匈牙利内政的粗暴的干涉。
