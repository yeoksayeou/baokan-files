New Achievements in Soviet Printmaking
Wu Biduan

The success of the October Revolution opened up new and vast avenues for Soviet printmaking art. In the forty-two years since, Soviet printmaking has experienced tremendous development. During my studies in the Soviet Union, I witnessed the emergence of many new and outstanding printmakers, whether in Moscow or Leningrad, in the capitals of the various republics or in remote areas. Today, prints are increasingly displayed in cities and farms alike, in public places and people's homes.

The Soviet Print Exhibition recently held in Beijing by the Chinese Artists Association and the Central Academy of Fine Arts to celebrate the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union showcases these new achievements in Soviet printmaking.

The more than two hundred and forty works on display include pieces presented to the printmaking department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts by the Leningrad Repin Academy of Fine Arts, and works given to individual Chinese students in the Soviet Union by several Soviet printmakers. Notably included are the lithograph “Leningrad Landscape” by printmaker Ostroumova, the lithographic illustrations for French writer Maupassant's novel "Bel Ami" by the famous illustrator Rudakov, and the woodcut “Lenin and Krupskaya in the Caucasus” by Staronov.

We are very pleased to see the lithographic portraits and several landscapes by the famous Soviet lithographer and Academician of the Academy of Fine Arts, Vereisky. Academician Vereisky is known as a portrait painter. When I saw his lithographic portrait "Doctor Lyudmila," I remembered talking to him about this portrait during my visit to the Soviet Union. He said that at the time he was ill and in the hospital, and it was the ordinary yet sublime qualities of those who diligently served patients day and night that inspired him to create this portrait. Her serious and wise eyes and motherly kindness make you feel very close to her. In addition to the works of veteran painters, there are also many works by young printmakers, such as the copperplate portraits by Moscow youth printmaker Fedin, and the linocut "Noon at the Switch" by my teacher, the Leningrad printmaker Vittelgonsky. These are scenes that can often be seen in the Soviet Union, but the painter has emotionally extracted and absorbed these ordinary details of life into the picture, making you feel that they are not trivial matters of life, but poems, a happy struggle full of confidence in the cause of communism.

A group of copperplate prints called "Scenery of Fishing Port" by an Estonian young copperplate printmaker, exhibited at the exhibition, has received great attention from the audience. Küt has deep feelings for fishermen. He often lives among them, so although what he paints is scenery, we can see how much he understands fishermen. From his paintings, you can feel the strong smell of salt water, the vast ocean and the image of hardworking and simple fishermen. If the painter had not gone deep into life and developed deep feelings for the people, he would not have been able to create such moving works.

I was particularly moved by the graduation works of several graduates of the printmaking department of the Leningrad Repin Academy of Fine Arts exhibited this time. Nikonov's several linocut prints with revolutionary songs as the theme excellently embody the content of the songs. We see Chapayev wielding his knife and galloping across the prairie with heroic spirit, and the Red Army soldiers' soaring emotions of charging. In particular, he appropriately uses several strong tones to show the exciting rhythm of the song, leaving a deep impression on the audience. Starov's color linocut series with the theme of the Patriotic War has received high praise from the graduate review committee of the Soviet Academy of Fine Arts. He has achieved considerable success in using printmaking techniques to express huge themes. Starov participated in the entire Patriotic War, and this series of paintings had already begun to be conceived in the post-war era. He began to create in 1957. The sketches he saved from the war became the most valuable material for his creation of the series. He has deep feelings for China, and even now he still keeps a fairy tale picture book about China that he saw in his childhood. There is also Krasov's work, and he is the most represented one in this exhibition. His graduation work "1917" has received great attention from the Soviet printmaking community because the author successfully created the images of various characters in the 1917 era, especially the image of women. Before starting the creation, he visited many old revolutionary soldiers and eyewitnesses of the revolution, read many books and movies describing the October Revolution, and even read the reports on the Russian October Revolution written by foreign reporters at that time. His serious and vivid composition, bold refinement and selection, and black and white processing techniques are closely combined with his skilled skills, making the picture very lively and powerful.

Although this exhibition only collected a limited number of works from certain regions, and most of them are works by recent graduates and students of the printmaking department of the Leningrad Repin Academy of Fine Arts, so it cannot show the full picture of Soviet printmaking art, but from these works, we can also see the new achievements of Soviet printmakers. Soviet printmaking has had a great influence on the development of our country's printmaking art in the past, and it is still a good example for us to learn from.

    苏联版画的新成就
    伍必端
    十月革命的成功，给苏联的版画艺术开拓了新的广阔的道路，四十二年来苏联的版画已有了非常巨大的发展。当我在苏联学习期间，看到不论在莫斯科或是在列宁格勒，不论是在各加盟共和国的首都或是在边远地区，都出现了不少新的优秀的版画家。如今，无论在城市或是农庄，无论是公共场所或人们的住宅，越来越多地都挂上了版画作品。
    最近，为庆祝伟大的苏联十月社会主义革命四十二周年，中国美术家协会和中央美术学院在北京举办的苏联版画展览会，就可以看出苏联版画的新成就。
    这次展出的二百四十余件作品，一部分是列宁格勒列宾美术学院送给中央美术学院版画系的；一部分是几位苏联版画家送给个别中国留苏学生的。其中可贵的是有版画家奥斯特罗乌莫娃的石版画“列宁格勒风景”和著名插图画家鲁达珂夫为法国作家莫伯桑的小说“俊友”等所作的石版插图，以及斯塔罗诺夫的木刻“列宁和克鲁普斯卡娅在高加索”等作品。
    我们非常高兴地看到苏联著名石版画家美术院院士维列茨基的石版肖像画和他的几幅风景画。维列茨基院士是以肖像画家著称的，当我看到他的石版肖像“柳德密娜医生”时，使我想起在苏联访问他时，他曾谈到过这张肖像，他说当时他生病住在医院，是这些日日夜夜勤勤恳恳为病人服务的既平凡又有崇高品质的人激起自己创作这张肖像的。严肃的和充满着智慧的一双眼睛，像母亲一样的慈祥态度，使你看了感到非常亲切。展览中除老画家的作品外，还有许多青年版画家的作品，如莫斯科青年版画家费定的铜版肖像，我的老师列宁格勒版画家维特尔贡斯基的麻胶版画“中午在转辙处”等。这些生活在苏联经常可以看到，但是画家将这些生活中的平凡的细节，富于感情的提炼的吸收到画面上来，使你感到不是生活琐事，而是诗篇，是对共产主义事业充满信心的幸福的斗争。
    爱沙尼亚青年铜版画家在展览会上展出了他的一组“渔港风光”的铜版画受到观众很大重视，克尤特对渔民有着深厚的感情，他经常生活在渔民中间，所以他画的虽然是风景，但是我们可以看出他是多么了解渔民，从他的几张画里，你就能感到浓厚的盐水味，广阔的海洋和勤劳纯朴的渔民形象，如果不是画家深入到生活中去，对人民产生深厚的感情，那就创作不出这样动人的作品的。
    特别使我感到亲切的是这次展出的列宁格勒列宾美术学院版画院几位毕业生的毕业创作。尼珂诺夫的以革命歌曲为主题的几幅麻胶版画很出色的体现出歌曲的内容，我们看到夏伯阳挥刀奔驰在草原上的英雄气概，红军战士冲锋激昂的情绪，特别是他用几个强烈的色调恰当地显示歌曲的激昂节奏，给观众留下很深的印象。斯塔洛夫的以卫国战争为主题的套色麻胶版组画，曾受到苏联美术院毕业生评判委员会的很高的评价。他在运用版画手法，表现巨大主题内容上得到相当的成功。斯塔洛夫参加整个卫国战争，这套组画早在战后年代已经开始构思，1957年他就开始进行创作。他所保存下来在战争时期画的速写成了他创作在套组画的最珍贵的资料。他对中国有着深厚的感情，直到现在他还保存着他童年时所看到的有关描写中国的童话画册。还有?克拉索夫的作品，他是这次展出中最多的一位。他的毕业创作“1917年”受到苏联版画界很大的重视。因为作者成功地创造了1917年代各种人物的形象，特别是妇女的形象。在创作开始以前，他曾访问过许多老革命战士和当时革命的目击者，看了许多描写十月革命的读物及电影，甚至当时外国记者所写的对俄国十月革命的报道，他都找来看。他那严肃的、生动的构图、大胆的提炼取舍和黑白的处理手法都与他熟练的技巧密切的结合着，画面非常生动有力。
    虽然这次展出的只收集了某些地区的有限数量的作品，而且大部分是列宁格勒列宾美术学院版画系近年毕业生和同学的作品，所以它还不能显示苏联版画艺术的全貌，但是从这些作品，也可以看出苏联版画家们的新成就。苏联版画，过去对我国版画艺术的发展有着很大的影响，而今仍是我们学习借鉴的好榜样。
