Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 26th. Mr. Kenzo Matsumura of Japan and his entourage left Wuhan by plane for Shanghai this morning. They arrived in Wuhan on the 24th evening by boat from Chongqing.

Zhao Xinchu, Vice Governor of Hubei Province, hosted a banquet on the evening of the 25th to entertain the guests. In his speech at the banquet, Zhao Xinchu welcomed Mr. Kenzo Matsumura and his entourage to Wuhan and expressed his belief that their visit would contribute to the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan and the improvement of relations between the two countries.

Zhao Xinchu then severely condemned the outrageous acts of the Kishi Nobusuke government in its hostility towards China. He said that the Kishi Nobusuke government, in disregard of the strong opposition of the Japanese people, is increasingly intensifying its pursuit of the United States in its hostility towards China, and is now stepping up its activities to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Foreign Minister Fujiyama even clamored on November 16 that the important equipment stipulated in the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" includes nuclear weapons, and declared that the operational scope of the U.S. forces stationed in Japan in the Far East includes the area north of the Philippines, the Chinese coast, and the Soviet Maritime Territory. This blatantly shows that the so-called Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is aimed at China and the Soviet Union. The facts clearly prove that the Kishi Nobusuke government is willing to act as a running dog of the United States, colluding with the United States to further prepare for a new war of aggression. But if a war is provoked by the American aggressors, the first to suffer will be the Japanese people. The people of China and the Soviet Union, with their powerful strength, are not afraid of any aggressive blocs. Zhao Xinchu pointed out that the Chinese people fully understand that the Japanese people are against war, demanding Sino-Japanese friendship and the restoration of normal relations between the two countries. Many Japanese politicians, including Mr. Ishibashi and some insightful people within the Liberal Democratic Party, including Mr. Matsumura, also advocate promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and safeguarding peace in the Far East.

Kenzo Matsumura then spoke, saying: If the Kishi Nobusuke government has such words and deeds, it is "a violation of the constitution, and nothing will succeed if it violates the constitution."

Mr. Kenzo Matsumura and his entourage visited the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, and the Yangtze River Bridge in Wuhan on the 25th, and toured the city.

    松村谦三访问武汉后去上海
    新华社武汉26日电　日本松村谦三先生和他的随行人员今天上午乘飞机离开武汉去上海。他们是24日晚上乘船由重庆来到武汉的。
    湖北省副省长赵辛初25日晚上设宴招待客人。赵辛初在宴会上致词欢迎松村谦三先生和他的随行人员来到武汉访问，并表示相信他们的访问将有助于中日两国人民的友好和改善中日两国的关系。
    赵辛初接着严厉谴责了岸信介政府敌视中国的狂妄举动，他说，岸信介政府不顾日本人民的强烈反对，越来越变本加厉地追随美国敌视中国，现在正在加紧进行修改日美“安全条约”的活动。藤山外相在11月16日竟公然喊叫日美“安全条约”中所规定的重要装备中包括核武器，并扬言驻日美军在远东的作战范围包括菲律宾以北、中国沿岸和苏联滨海边区。这露骨地说明了所谓日美“安全条约”是针对中苏两国的。事实清楚地证明岸信介政府是甘心充当美国的走卒，和美国勾结在一起，进一步准备新的侵略战争。但如果战争一旦被美国侵略者挑起，首先受害的将是日本人民。有着强大力量的中苏两国人民是不怕任何侵略集团的。赵辛初指出，中国人民充分了解日本人民是反对战争、要求中日友好和恢复两国正常关系的。日本许多政治家，包括石桥先生、松村先生在内的自由民主党内的一些有识之士，也同样是主张促进中日友好、保卫远东和平的。
    松村谦三接着讲话，他说：如果岸信介政府有这种言行，那是“违反宪法的，违反了宪法什么事也不会成功”。
    松村谦三先生和他的随行人员25日在武汉曾参观了武汉钢铁公司、武汉重型机床厂和长江大桥，并且游览了市容。
