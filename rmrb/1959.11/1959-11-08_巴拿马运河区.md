    The Panama Canal Zone

    In Central America, between North and South America, there is a region called the Isthmus of Panama, which is the territory of Panama, and the Panama Canal is built here. The canal is 81.3 kilometers long and took a total of 33 years to complete (from 1881 to 1914).

    The United States' occupation of the Panama Canal Zone has a long history. As early as 1878, a French company obtained a lease from the Colombian government to build the canal. Later, being unable to excavate it alone, the United States bought all the company's property and excavation rights for $40 million. In order to build this canal, the United States reached an agreement with Britain in 1901, in which Britain agreed that the canal would be built by the United States, and that the United States would "enjoy all rights pertaining to the construction of the canal and stipulate the regulations and full authority for its management." By 1903, the United States made an unreasonable demand to Colombia for a long-term lease of part of the Isthmus of Panama. Due to the Colombian government's refusal, the United States created a "revolution" in Colombia, causing Panama to declare its independence from Colombia. Then, in the same year, the United States imposed the "U.S.-Panama Treaty" on Panama, obtaining "perpetual lease rights" over the Panama Canal Zone. According to the treaty, the United States obtained the area including ten miles on both sides of the canal for a one-time payment of $10 million and a subsequent annual rent of $250,000. As stipulated, the Canal Zone is governed by a U.S.-appointed Canal Governor, and the United States enjoys extraterritorial rights in the Canal Zone, with its own laws and police. It also has the right to station troops and build fortifications. Currently, approximately 25,000 U.S. troops are stationed in the Canal Zone, and the ports of Balboa on the Pacific side and Cristobal on the Atlantic side have become U.S. naval bases.

    Since the United States occupied the Canal Zone, the people of Panama have launched a resolute struggle, forcing the United States to repeatedly revise the treaty, increasing the "rent" from the original $250,000 to $1.93 million in 1955. The new treaty of 1955 also added provisions such as equal pay for equal work for American and Panamanian employees in the canal, but this provision remains a dead letter and has not been implemented to this day. The wages of Panamanian workers in the Canal Zone are only one-sixth of those of American workers. However, the United States earns a profit of $15 million annually from operating the canal. In 1954, U.S. investment in Panama reached $433.3 million. From 1950 to 1954 alone, the profits it plundered amounted to $332.2 million. According to 1958 statistics, the Canal Authority received more than $41 million in tolls for the entire year, while the Panamanian government only received 4%.

    Last December, the Panamanian National Assembly passed a law stipulating that the Panamanian territorial sea be extended from three nautical miles to twelve nautical miles. The U.S. government has stated that it does not recognize "any obligation" to Panama's extension of its territorial sea.

    From this, it can be seen that the U.S. occupation of the Panama Canal Zone not only seriously infringes upon the integrity of Panama's national sovereignty but is also an act of plunder. This cannot but arouse strong resistance from the Panamanian people, and the call for the recovery of canal sovereignty is growing louder. The demonstrations held by the Panamanian people inside and outside the Canal Zone on November 3, 4, and 5 were a climax of the Panamanian people's just struggle. Therefore, even the U.S. news agency had to admit that this anti-American demonstration was the fiercest anti-American riot in Panama in more than 30 years. (Guo)

    巴拿马运河区
    在南北美洲之间的中美洲有一个地区，叫巴拿马海峡，这是巴拿马的领土，巴拿马运河就开凿在这里。运河有八十一点三公里长，前后一共开了三十三年才完工。（从1881—1914年）
    美国对巴拿马运河区的霸占，由来已久。早在1878年，法国一家公司向哥伦比亚政府取得了建筑运河的租借权，后来由于无力独家开凿，美国就以四千万美元的代价将开凿运河公司的全部财产和开凿权买了过来。美国为了开凿这条运河与英国在1901年达成了协议，英国同意运河由美国开凿，美国“享有附属于开凿运河的一切权利，并规定该运河的规章和管理的全权”。至1903年，美国就向哥伦比亚提出长期租借巴拿马海峡一部分土地的无理要求，由于哥伦比亚政府的拒绝，美国便在哥伦比亚制造“革命”，使巴拿马宣告脱离哥伦比亚而独立。然后，在同年，美国就把“美巴条约”强加于巴拿马，取得了对巴拿马运河区的“永久租借权”。按照条约，美国以一次付清一千万美元和以后每年租金二十五万美元的代价获得了包括运河两岸十哩的地区。按规定，运河区由美国任命的运河总督统治，美国在运河区享有治外法权，有自己的法律和警察。并有权驻军和建筑防御工事。现在约有二万五千名美军驻在运河区，在运河的两端，在太平洋的巴尔菩亚港和在大西洋的克里斯托巴尔港都成了美国的海军基地。
    自从美国霸占了运河区以来，巴拿马人民一直展开坚决的斗争，迫使美国一再修改条约，使“租金”由原来的二十五万美元增加至1955年的一百九十三万美元。1955年的新条约还增加了运河内美籍和巴拿马籍人同工同酬等的规定，但这一规定至今仍是纸上空文，并未实行。运河区巴拿马工人的工资只等于美籍工人工资的六分之一。然而美国却由于经营运河每年获得了一千五百万美元的利润。在1954年，美国在巴拿马的投资达四亿三千三百万美元。仅从1950—1954年中，它所掠夺的利润就高达三亿三千二百万美元。而根据1958年的统计，运河当局全年获得的通行费有四千一百多万美元，而分给巴拿马政府的只占4％。
    去年12月，巴拿马国民议会通过法案，规定把巴拿马领海范围从三海里扩展到十二海里。美国政府竟表示不承认巴拿马延伸领海范围的“任何义务”。
    由此可见，美国强占巴拿马运河区，不仅严重侵犯了巴拿马国家主权的完整，而且是一种掠夺行为。这不能不引起巴拿马人民的强烈反抗，要求收回运河主权的呼声越来越高。11月3日、4日和5日巴拿马人民在运河区内外举行的示威游行，更是巴拿马人民正义斗争的一个高潮。因此，连美国通讯社也不得不承认，这次反美示威是三十多年来巴拿马发生的最凶的反美暴动。　（国）
