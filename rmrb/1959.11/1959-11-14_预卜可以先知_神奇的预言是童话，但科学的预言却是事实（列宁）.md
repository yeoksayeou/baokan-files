    Foreknowledge is Possible
    Miraculous Prophecies are Fairy Tales, But Scientific Predictions are Facts (Lenin)
    Zhang Junsen
    People have long wanted to foresee the future, but for a long time they did not have enough knowledge to make such predictions. Science arises from the needs of human production and develops with the development of production. Scientific prediction is based on a deep understanding of the objective laws of development of society and nature, which are independent of people's will, and is therefore truthful and can withstand repeated testing in practice.

    Examples of Scientific Prediction

    In astronomy, we currently know that there are nine major planets revolving around the sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. But before 1846, scientists only knew of seven planets and knew nothing about Neptune and Pluto. In the eighteenth century, Academician Leksel of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences studied the motion of Uranus, the planet farthest from the sun among the seven planets known at the time, and pointed out that if Uranus was only affected by the gravity of the sun and the other six planets, then the motion of Uranus should be considered somewhat abnormal. How should this be explained? Based on Newton's law of universal gravitation, the scientist made the following prediction: outside Uranus, farther away from the sun, there should be an unknown planet whose gravity affects the motion of Uranus. Soon after, French astronomer and mathematician Urbain Le Verrier, through complex calculations, determined when and in what part of space this new planet could be seen. Finally, in the autumn of 1846, several days after Le Verrier pointed out which part of the sky could find this new planet, astronomer Johann Galle discovered the planet with a telescope and named it Neptune. Engels once called this discovery a scientific feat.

    In 1682, after observing a very large and bright comet that appeared in the sky that year, British scientist Edmond Halley speculated that this comet had previously appeared near the sun. After studying some historical records related to sky phenomena, Halley concluded that what people saw seventy-five years ago (i.e., 1607) and seventy-six years before that year (i.e., 1531) was the same comet, and predicted that this comet would appear again in about seventy-six years. Another scientist, Alexis Clairaut, after more precise calculations, predicted that the next appearance would be in April 1759. The result was exactly like this. The appearance of Halley's Comet differed from Clairaut's calculation by only one month. The reappearance of Halley's Comet in 1385 differed from the calculation by only three days.

    The most outstanding example of scientific prediction is the discovery of the periodic law of elements. This achievement belongs to the Russian scientist Dmitri Mendeleev. The discovery and determination of gallium is a very outstanding example. Mendeleev made a prediction of a new element in 1871, and four years later (i.e., 1875), French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, after studying a mineral taken from the Pyrenees Mountains using spectral analysis, discovered gallium. After separating a few hundredths of a gram of gallium, he determined several of its properties and confirmed that it was similar to aluminum, which was the "eka-aluminium" predicted by Mendeleev. At this time, although Mendeleev had not seen this element, he immediately wrote to the French chemist saying: the specific gravity of gallium should be about 6. A few days later, a reply came from Paris saying: the specific gravity of gallium is 4.7. Boisbaudran thought Mendeleev was wrong. But Mendeleev firmly believed that he was correct, and he wrote another letter to Paris, pointing out: the specific gravity of gallium could not be 4.7, but should be 5.9 to 6. Due to Mendeleev's insistence, Boisbaudran conducted another inspection, which confirmed that the specific gravity of gallium was 5.94. Mendeleev's prediction was completely confirmed!

    In biology, British scientist Charles Darwin's prediction is very outstanding. How humans on Earth came to be is something people have wanted to know for generations. Religion's answer to people is: God created man! Of course, this answer is not convincing. After careful analysis and scientific synthesis, Darwin came to the conclusion that humans evolved from apes, and created the theory of evolution about the origin of mankind. Darwin predicted that the anthropoid apes that lived in the tropical forests of Europe and Asia millions of years ago were the ancestors of humans, and that these anthropoid apes are now extinct. At that time, Darwin's opponents asked: since anthropoid apes once existed on Earth, then scientists must at least find their remains in the strata! Darwin said with certainty: these remains will definitely be found in the earth's crust in the future.

    Darwin's prediction was finally confirmed! In 1891, Dutch doctor Eugène Dubois, while studying the ancient strata of Java, discovered a skull, a femur, and several teeth in a stratum about fifteen meters deep. After research by many scientists, it was confirmed to be the remains of an anthropoid ape. This thoroughly confirmed Darwin's theory of human evolution and Engels' theory that labor created man.

    In various departments of science, there are also many outstanding examples of scientific prediction. The realization of space flight using rockets was predicted long ago by the great Soviet scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. The release of a large amount of binding energy when an atom splits was predicted long ago by Albert Einstein. The impossibility of perpetual motion has been predicted by the first and second laws of thermodynamics. There have been many well-intentioned but blind perpetual motion enthusiasts in history, but they have all ended in failure!

    Prediction of Accidental Phenomena

    The above lists many outstanding examples of scientific prediction. People may ask: "These are all phenomena that must occur under certain conditions!" Yes! These examples are all about inevitable phenomena. However, due to the progress of science, people can also make a certain degree of prediction for those almost elusive accidental phenomena.

    Generally speaking: the appearance or non-appearance of accidental phenomena depends on many different accidental factors. Therefore, the appearance or non-appearance of a single accidental phenomenon is not regular and cannot be predicted. However, a large number of accidental phenomena (or a collective of accidental phenomena) exhibits a new law—statistical law—under the cover of apparent irregularity. Using this new law, people are no longer powerless to deal with some accidental phenomena that occur in production, but can predict and master them. For example: although we do not know whether the crest will appear in the next toss of a coin, we do know that if the toss of the coin is uniform, then the probability (or probability) of the crest appearing during the toss is 1/2, that is, if the coin is tossed many times, then the number of times the crest appears will approximately be equal to 1/2 of the total number of tosses. The more times tossed, the more accurate this ratio is.

    Accidental phenomena are also often encountered in production. For example: when designing bridges, reservoirs, river embankments, and hydroelectric power stations, it is necessary to know the future situation of the river, including the river's future flow rate, discharge, and water level. However, these quantities are all random quantities because they are affected by many random factors. These factors themselves and their impact on flow rate, discharge, and water level are still impossible to predict, so solving this problem seems difficult. After studying the statistical laws of a large number of accidental phenomena, some departments of modern science (mainly: probability theory and mathematical statistics) have provided us with solutions to this type of problem. After investigating and statistically analyzing hydrological data over the years, using this scheme, although we cannot predict what the highest water level of the Yangtze River will reach in the year 2000, we can predict that the highest water level of the Yangtze River will not exceed a certain amount in the year 2000 or in the long run in the future. If the hydrological data accumulated over the years is richer, then people will be more accurate when making this prediction. Although this prediction cannot completely answer a certain point, it can be said to be effective enough for people to study the entire process and apply it in production.

    In surveying, such examples are often encountered. In theory, the sum of the three interior angles of any triangle (as long as the area is not too large) is 180°, but due to the influence of measurement errors (measurement errors are also accidental quantities affected by many random factors), when you measure the triangle separately and add the results, you will rarely get exactly 180°. Sometimes it may be slightly larger, sometimes it may be slightly smaller. What should I do? From which angle should something be added or subtracted? This seemingly elusive problem can also be solved after studying the statistical laws of a large number of errors.

    There are even more such examples in machinery. Such as the inspection problem of a large number of products, because the number of products is very large, in most cases it is impossible and unnecessary to check them one by one. Often only a part is sampled, and then the situation of all the products is estimated from the results of the sampling, that is, the product situation of the sampled part. When determining the sampling plan, how many samples need to be sampled, how these samples are obtained, and how the situation of the entire batch of products is estimated based on the situation of the samples, all of this requires a certain prediction of the complex random quantity of product quality. This sampling theory is also based on probability theory and mathematical statistics.

    In short, with the accumulation of human knowledge, science is depicting an increasingly clear and increasingly accurate picture of the natural world for us. From the universe to elementary particles, we can all recognize and master them one by one. Agnosticism can rest!

    预卜可以先知
    神奇的预言是童话，但科学的预言却是事实（列宁）
    张浚森
    人们很早就想预见未来，但是，人们长期以来并没有足够的知识可以作这样的预见。科学是由于人类生产的需要而产生，随着生产的发展而发展起来的。科学的预见是以深刻认识客观的、不依人们意志为转移的社会和自然界的发展规律为依据的，因而是真实的，经得起实践的反复考验的。
    科学预见的举例
    在天文学中，我们目前知道围绕太阳旋转的大行星共有九个：水星、金星、地球、火星、木星、土星、天王星、海王星、冥王星。但是在1846年以前，科学家还只知道有七个行星，对海王星和冥王星是一无所知的。十八世纪时，彼得堡科学院院士列克谢里对当时已知的七颗行星中离太阳最远的一颗行星——天王星的运动作了研究以后，指出：如果天王星只受到太阳以及其余六个行星的引力的话，那末就应当说天王星的运动是有点不正常。这应该怎样来解释呢？这位科学家根据牛顿的万有引力定律作出了这样的预言：在天王星的外面离开太阳更远的地方，应当还有一颗未知的行星，这颗未知的行星以自己的引力影响着天王星的运动。不久以后，法国天文学家兼数学家勒未累经过复杂的计算确定出什么时候在太空的什么部分将可以看到这颗新行星。终于在1846年的秋季，在勒未累指出了天空中哪一部分可以找到这颗新行星的若干天后，天文学家加尔果就在天文望远镜中发现了这颗行星，定名为海王星。恩格斯曾把这个发现称为科学的伟绩。
    1682年英国科学家哈雷对于这一年在天空中出现的一颗很大很亮的彗星进行了观察以后，曾经推想这颗彗星在以前曾经在太阳附近出现过。哈雷研究了有关天空现象的一些历史记载后，作出了结论，认为七十五年前（即1607年）以及这一年的七十六年前（即1531年）人们所看到的正是同一颗彗星，并且预言大约在七十六年后这颗彗星还会出现。另一位科学家克列罗经过更精确的计算后预言，下一次出现将在1759年4月。结果事实正是这样。哈雷彗星的出现与克列罗的计算只差一个月。哈雷彗星在1385年的再次出现与计算只差三天。
    科学预见中最卓越的例子是元素周期律的发现。这个功绩是属于俄国科学家德·伊·门德列也夫的。其中镓的发现及其测定是一个十分杰出的例子。门德列也夫在1871年作出了新元素的预言，四年后（即1875年）法国化学家勒柯克·德·布阿勃德朗，用光谱分析法对比利牛斯山上取来的一种矿物进行了研究后发现了镓。在分离得百分之几克的镓后，确定了它的几种性质，证实它跟铝相似，也就是门德列也夫所预言的准铝。这时门德列也夫虽然未见过这种元素，却立刻写信给这位法国化学家说：镓的比重应当大约是6。几天后，从巴黎来的回信说：镓的比重是4.7。布阿勃德朗认为门德列也夫错了。而门德列也夫坚信自己是正确的，他又写了封信去巴黎，指出：镓的比重不可能是4.7，而应当是5.9到6。由于门德列也夫的坚持，于是布阿勃德朗又进行了一次检查，结果证实了镓的比重是5.94。完全证实了门德列也夫的预言！
    在生物学里，英国科学家达尔文的预言是十分杰出的。关于地球上的人类是怎样产生的，这是人们世世代代想知道的事。宗教给人们的回答是：上帝创造了人！当然这种回答是不能令人信服的。达尔文在经过周密分析及科学综合后得出了人是由猿猴演变得来的结论，创立了关于人类起源的进化学说。达尔文预言：数百万年前在欧洲和亚洲热带森林里居住在树上的类人猿就是人类的祖先，这种类人猿现在已经绝迹了。当时达尔文的反对者责问道：既然地球上存在过类人猿，那末科学家起码也得在地层里发现它们的遗骸呀！达尔文很有把握地说：这种遗骸将来一定会在地壳里发现。
    达尔文的预言终于被证实了！在1891年荷兰医生杜步亚在研究爪哇岛的古代地层时，曾在深约十五米的地层里发现了一副头盖骨、大腿骨和几枚牙齿，经很多科学家研究，证实为类人猿的遗骸。这就彻底证实了达尔文的人类进化学说及恩格斯的劳动创造了人的学说。
    在科学的各个部门里也存在着很多科学预见的卓越的例子。利用火箭来实现宇宙航行这是早就被伟大的苏联科学家齐奥尔科夫斯基所预言过的。原子分裂时会放出大量的结合能这是早就被爱因斯坦所预言过的。永动机的不可能成功，已为热力学的第一及第二定律所预言，在历史上曾有过不少好意的但是盲目的永动机的尝试者，终究都以失败而告终了！
    对偶然现象的预见
    上面列举了很多科学预见的卓越的例子。人们也许会问：“这些都是在一定条件下必然发生的现象呀！”对！这些事例都是关于必然现象的。不过由于科学的进步，对于那些几乎不可捉摸的偶然现象，人们也能够作出一定程度的预言了。
    一般地说：偶然现象的出现与否决定于许许多多的不同的偶然因素。因而单一偶然现象的出现与否是没有规律性的，是不能预见的。但是大量偶然现象（或称偶然现象的集体）却在表面上没有规律的掩盖下，出现了一种新的规律——统计规律。运用这种新的规律，人们对在生产中所发生的一些偶然现象就不再是无能为力的了，而是能预见它，掌握它。例如：虽然我们不知道钱币在下一次抛掷中会不会出现徽花，但是我们却知道：假若钱币的投掷是均匀的，那末在抛掷时出现徽花之概率（或称或然率）为1／2，也即把钱币抛掷很多次，那末出现徽花的次数大约会等于总抛掷次数的1／2，总次数愈多，这个比数愈正确。
    偶然现象在生产上也是常遇到的。例如：在设计大桥、水库、江堤和水力发电站的时候，需要知道河流未来的情况，其中主要是关于河流在未来的流速、流量及水位，但是这些量都是偶然量，因为它们受着许许多多偶然因素的影响。这些因素本身及其对流速、流量、水位的影响至今还是无法预计的，因而解决这个问题看来是困难的。在研究了大量偶然现象的统计规律后，近代科学的一些部门（主要是：概率论及数理统计学）已经向我们提供了解决这类问题的方案。在调查、统计了历年的水文资料后，运用这种方案，虽然我们不能预言在公元二千年长江的最高水位将达多少，但是我们可以预言在公元二千年或今后长此下去长江的最高水位将不超过多少。假若历年的水文资料积累得愈丰富，那末人们在作出这种预言的时候也就愈正确。这种预言虽不能完全肯定回答某一点，但对人们在研究整个过程及在生产中的运用可以说是足够有效的。
    在测量学中也常遇到这样的例子，按理说任何三角形（只要面积不是太大）三内角之和为180°，但是由于测量误差之影响（测量误差也是个受着许多偶然因素影响的偶然量），当你分别测量三角后，将其结果相加，这时很少会得出刚好是180°的情况，有时可能稍大一些有时可能稍小一些。应该怎么办呢？究竟从那一角中加上或减去一些呢？这个看来是很难捉摸的问题，在研究了大量误差的统计规律后，也能得到解决。
    在机械里面更有不少这样的例子。如大量产品的检验问题，由于产品数量很多，在大多数情况下不可能也不必要逐一的去检查，往往只抽查一部分，而后从抽查的结果，即所抽查部分的产品情况，去估计全部产品的情况。在确定抽查方案时，究竟需要抽查多少样品，这些样品怎样取得，怎样根据样品的情况去估计全批产品的情况，这一切都须对产品质量这个复杂的偶然量具备一定的预见，这种抽样理论也是建立在概率论和数理统计学的基础上的。
    总之，随着人类知识的积累，科学向我们描绘了一幅愈来愈清楚、愈来愈精确的自然界的图画。大至宇宙，小至基本粒子，我们都能够一一认识，逐个掌握。不可知论可以休矣！
