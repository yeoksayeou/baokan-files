    Good News from the Grasslands
    Delightful news has come from the grasslands of Inner Mongolia: a mass movement in animal husbandry production, the "Guarantee 100 Calves from 100 Mothers" campaign, is being enthusiastically launched throughout the region.
    This is a creation of the masses in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. It is a good way to further implement the Party's General Line on the animal husbandry front, and to develop animal husbandry production in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way.
    The "Guarantee 100 Calves from 100 Mothers" campaign is a movement to raise the survival rate of livestock breeding to a higher level. The level of the breeding survival rate is a concentrated expression of the success or failure of animal husbandry production. The specific content of the movement is: for every hundred head of mature female livestock, strive to breed and raise one hundred calves within one pastoral year. However, different requirements and standards are set for female livestock of different sizes according to the actual situation: for cattle, horses, and donkeys, one hundred mature female animals are required to breed and raise eighty calves; for camels, forty calves; and for small livestock, the breeding survival rate is required to be above 100%. At the same time, it is required that the proportion of various improved breeds of calves should also be increased accordingly. This means: both greatly developing the quantity of livestock, and improving the quality of livestock; both developing large livestock, and developing small livestock. Therefore, the "Guarantee 100 Calves from 100 Mothers" campaign has the characteristics of being vivid, easy to understand, and having advanced indicators.
    The "Guarantee 100 Calves from 100 Mothers" campaign prominently reflects the desire of the broad masses in pastoral areas to develop animal husbandry production at high speed. High speed is a fundamental issue in all our construction undertakings. Being able to raise one hundred calves from one hundred mature female livestock in one year is, of course, an unprecedented high speed in animal husbandry production. The result of the "Guarantee 100 Calves from 100 Mothers" campaign will certainly push animal husbandry production in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to a new stage.
    Is it possible to universally achieve the requirements of the "Guarantee 100 Calves from 100 Mothers" campaign in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia? The answer is yes. After last year's Great Leap Forward and this year's continued Leap Forward, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has already seen many "Guarantee 100 Calves from 100 Mothers" livestock groups. According to incomplete statistics from eighteen banners, counties, and cities, in 1959 there were 679 small livestock groups, a total of 119,046 female animals, which bred and raised 133,169 calves, with a breeding survival rate of 112%. According to incomplete statistics from four banners and counties, seventy large livestock groups with 7,819 female animals bred and raised 6,517 calves, with a breeding survival rate of 83.3%. This means that the masses already have rich experience and a broad foundation in animal husbandry's "large-scale, high-yield, bumper harvest." Coupled with the excellent situation in animal husbandry production that has emerged under the light of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, favorable conditions are provided for realizing "Guarantee 100 Calves from 100 Mothers." Since the second half of this year, the entire region has harvested seven billion catties of grass, planted more than one million mu of feed grass, and made great achievements in winter preparation work such as water conservancy construction, shed construction, livestock mating, and livestock disease prevention. More importantly, there is the enthusiastic support and strong leadership of Party committees at all levels. In order to successfully carry out the "Guarantee 100 Calves from 100 Mothers" campaign, Party committees at all levels have launched detailed and in-depth socialist education in the vast pastoral areas, and have led the broad masses of herdsmen to improve management and administration in all aspects. All of this powerfully demonstrates that the hardworking and brave masses of herdsmen in Inner Mongolia are fully capable of realizing their grand plan.

    草原传喜讯
    从内蒙古草原上传来了令人欣喜的新消息，一个群众性的畜牧业生产上的“百母保百仔”运动，正在全区范围内热烈展开。
    这是内蒙古牧区群众在党的八届八中全会精神的鼓舞下，鼓足干劲的一个创举，是畜牧战线上进一步贯彻党的总路线，多快好省地发展畜牧生产的一个很好的形式。
    “百母保百仔”运动是把牲畜繁殖成活率提到更高水平的运动。繁殖成活率的高低是畜牧业生产好坏的集中表现。运动的具体内容是：每一百头大小适龄母畜在一个牧业年度内，争取保育成活一百头仔畜。但对大小母畜按照实际情况规定不同的要求标准：牛、马、驴一百头适龄母畜要求繁殖成活仔畜八十头，骆驼为四十峰，小牲畜的繁殖成活率要求在100％以上。同时要求各种改良仔畜的比例也有相应的提高。这就是：既要大大发展牲畜的数量，又要提高牲畜的质量；既要发展大牲畜，又要发展小牲畜。因此，“百母保百仔”运动具有鲜明生动、简单易懂和指标先进的特点。
    “百母保百仔”运动突出的反映了牧区广大群众高速度发展畜牧生产的要求。高速度是我们各项建设事业中的一个根本问题。在一年内能够从一百头大小适龄的母畜中育成一百头仔畜，这当然是畜牧业生产上从未见过的高速度。“百母保百仔”运动开展的结果，一定会把内蒙古自治区畜牧业生产推向一个新阶段。
    在内蒙古牧区普遍实现“百母保百仔”运动的要求，有没有可能呢？回答是肯定的。经过去年的大跃进和今年的继续跃进，内蒙古自治区已经出现了很多的“百母保百仔”畜群。根据十八个旗、县、市的不完全统计，1959年度即有六百七十九个小畜群，共十一万九千零四十六只母畜，繁殖成活仔畜十三万三千一百六十九只，繁殖成活率达112％。又据四个旗、县的不完全统计，七十个大畜群的七千八百一十九头母畜，繁殖成活仔畜六千五百十七头，繁殖成活率达83.3％。这就是说，在群众中已经有了畜牧业“大面积高额丰产”的丰富经验和广泛基础。加上在党的八届八中全会决议照耀下出现的畜牧业生产的大好形势，为实现“百母保百仔”提供了有利的条件。今年下半年以来，全区已打草七十亿斤，种了饲草一百多万亩，水利建设、棚圈搭盖、牲畜配种、畜疫防治等各项过冬准备工作，已取得很大成绩。更重要的是，各级党委的热烈支持和坚强领导。为了胜利地开展“百母保百仔”运动，各级党委已经在广大牧区展开了细致深入的社会主义教育，已经领导广大牧民从各方面改进了经营管理工作。所有这一切，都有力地表明，勤劳勇敢的内蒙古广大牧民群众，是完全能够实现自己的豪迈计划的。
