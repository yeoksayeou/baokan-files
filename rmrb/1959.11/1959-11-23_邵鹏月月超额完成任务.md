    Shao Peng Exceeds Task Every Month
    △ Shao Peng, a truck driver at the Hangzhou Highway Transportation Bureau in Zhejiang Province, has exceeded his transportation tasks every month for the past seven years. He has also saved the state over 4,000 liters of gasoline and over 440,000 tire-kilometers.
    Shao Peng tries every possible means to complete his transportation tasks, and his achievements have been improving constantly. Last year, when the leaders of the Highway Transportation Bureau proposed the call of "Full Load, More Tows, Fast Running, Safety, Economy, and 500,000 Kilometers Without Major Overhaul," Shao Peng used his brains and worked closely with loading and unloading workers. The output of a single truck increased month by month. In July and August, it increased to more than 65,000 ton-kilometers, more than doubling the first quarter, and he won the honorary title of "Transportation Expert" in the province. Then in September, he launched a technical innovation in the high-yield movement of 100,000 ton-kilometers, implementing a double-trailer system for one truck, breaking through the threshold of 100,000 ton-kilometers per month for a single truck, and completing more than 116,000 ton-kilometers.
    Over the past few years, Shao Peng has successively found some ways to save gasoline in routine maintenance and adjustment of carburetors, gasoline pumps, and distributors, reducing the fuel consumption of his truck from 30 liters per 100 kilometers to 17 liters.
    Shao Peng also pays great attention to saving tires and extending the service life of machine parts. Every time he arrives at the terminal, he always washes the car clean before going home to rest. On the road, whenever there are situations such as passing cars or narrow roads, he always takes the initiative to give way, so there have never been any car accidents.

    邵鹏月月超额完成任务
    △浙江省杭州公路运输局汽车驾驶员邵鹏，七年来月月超额完成运输任务，并为国家节约汽油四千多公升，节约轮胎四十四万多胎公里。
    邵鹏千方百计完成运输任务，成绩一跃再跃。去年公路运输局领导上提出“满载、多拖、快跑、安全、节约，五十万公里无大修”的号召，邵鹏就开动脑筋，和装卸工人密切协作，单车产量月月提高，7、8月份提高到六万五千多吨公里，比第一季度翻了两番，获得全省“运输能手”的光荣称号。接着在9月份，他又在十万吨公里高产运动中开展技术革新，实行一车双挂，突破单车月产十万吨公里大关，完成了十一万六千多吨公里。
    几年来，邵鹏相继在例行保养和调整化油器、汽油泵、分电盘等方面找到了一些节约汽油的办法，使他驾驶的汽车耗油量从过去每百公里三十公升降低到十七公升。
    邵鹏还非常注意节约轮胎和延长机件使用时间。每次到终点站时，他总是把汽车洗得清清爽爽，然后回家休息。在路上，每逢车子交会、路窄等情况，他总是主动让开，因此从未发生过撞车事故。
