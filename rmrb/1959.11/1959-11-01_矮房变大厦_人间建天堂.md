In the Chongwen District of Beijing, there is a Happiness Village. Before liberation, this area was a stinking reed marsh and desolate cemetery; after liberation, houses were built, and roads were repaired—Happiness Avenue. In Happiness Village, there are twenty-one identical red brick buildings, which started construction last spring and were completed successively in September last year, people call them Happiness Mansions. When Beijing was building many new buildings, some residents' housing was demolished. These residents, under the proper arrangement and care of the People's Government, successively moved into Happiness Mansions.

Right-wing opportunists slander our Great Leap Forward as "petty-bourgeois fanaticism" and slander our many new constructions as "taxing the people and wasting money." They stand on different positions from us, so they have different feelings and speak different words. Now, let's listen to the feelings of those residents who originally lived on the land where the new buildings are located, and we can see how far the right-wing opportunists are from the thoughts and feelings of the broad masses of the people!　　　　　—Editor

　　The Great Leap Forward Brings a Better Life

　　Jiang Huizhen (38 years old, housewife, street activist, leader of the embroidery and patchwork production group):

　　My family originally lived at No. 14 Nancheng Root, which is now the site of the new Beijing Railway Station. We rented a house there for eleven years and only moved to Happiness Mansion last November. Speaking of moving into the mansion, I really have to talk endlessly, you don't know how considerate the government is. The residents' group leader took us to see the new mansion and asked us if we wanted to move. I said that in order to support national construction, my ability is low, and I can't contribute much, but I will not delay the move, and I will move as soon as I say so. Besides, the government has prepared such good mansions for us. Later, when we moved, we didn't spend a penny on moving expenses, and some families had children with measles, and the government even sent cars to prevent the children from catching a cold. After moving in, they came to investigate whether there was any loss during the move, and the lost items were compensated at the original price. You don't want it. Comrade, look at what the government doesn't think about for the people, doesn't think about for the second generation? Would there be such a thing in the old society?

　　Take the house as an example! The mansion is clean and tidy, and the sanitary facilities are complete. The government also takes care of your family's health, the elderly and children, the distance to work, and the family's financial situation, and asks you to voluntarily choose suitable locations and houses, and tries to help solve any difficulties. Therefore, those who moved in are all satisfied and very happy. Like my family of four, because there are elderly people, we were given a three-room apartment on the second floor, with a toilet, kitchen, and small balcony. Whenever it rains heavily, I think of the past, it rained heavily outside the house, and it rained lightly inside the house, the yard was full of puddles, and the kitchen was filled with water higher than the instep, and I had to hold an umbrella and wear high boots to cook, and I didn't know where to put the coal and firewood. Compared with now, it is really heaven and earth. You think: Am I grateful to Chairman Mao in my heart. If it weren't for the good leadership of the Communist Party, where would we be today. In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang, let alone not giving us mansions to live in, even if they gave us, I wouldn't dare to live in them, I couldn't afford the rent and deposit! After moving, some old relatives and friends often come to visit, and I always take them to see our house and introduce the moving situation. Every day when I look out from the window, I see new buildings more beautiful than the last being built around us, and I am really happy!

　　Life is getting better and better, and the enthusiasm for street work is also greater, and the mass work is becoming more and more smooth. Take the greening after the move as an example! Originally, the yard was full of large and small stones and bricks, and it was full of pits and bumps, but as soon as we called for greening the garden, planting more trees for shade, everyone actively participated. The old and the young all came to plant. The old ladies said: Old women don't have great strength, but they have small strength. Cadres also sacrificed their rest on Sundays to plant trees. Look how tall the small trees in our yard have grown. In order to welcome the National Day, we also planted a lot of flowers, and the children also helped water them, and each yard was cleaned up like a small garden. It's really comfortable to sit there. I heard that our greening work for Beijing residents is the best!

　　Some time ago, my sister came to Beijing, and I went to the new railway station to pick her up. Where is the dilapidated look of the place I lived in a year ago! Now it has become completely two worlds. Walking into the station is like entering a crystal palace, everywhere is bright and shiny, the pillars are tall and big, the glass lamps are of various styles, and there are the latest elevators, look at where it is beautiful, look at where it is satisfactory. I was overjoyed, and my sister also kept looking at it and couldn't stop smiling. She said that she had never seen such a station in her life. We also specially went to see the mother-child waiting room, hey! It's really good, there are all kinds of cribs, and they are covered with oilcloth mats, and they have prepared a lot of toys for the children, and the service staff comes to clean and take care of the passengers at any time. My sister said: Today's children are really blessed, I think they will have so much fun in the waiting room that they won't want to leave. We were both very happy, and I think other passengers were the same, they looked around as soon as they entered the station, with smiles on their faces. From the station, we can see the greatness of our country's socialist construction. We need a lot more of such buildings! Therefore, the Party's call for anti-rightist, high morale, and carrying out the increase production and practice economy is really necessary. The old saying goes, "dripping water wears away stone, and accumulating sand forms a tower," I think it makes sense. I myself have a low level of education. My ability is also low, and I can't do anything big, I must work hard to do a good job in street work and lead the embroidery and patchwork production group to repay Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

　　Miracles Happen in the Great Leap Forward

　　Wang Jinfang (42 years old, housewife):

　　The place where I originally lived—No. 3 Diaoyu Hutong, has been demolished to build the Beijing Railway Station. I moved into Happiness Mansion last December. Speaking of moving, I was really heartbroken. Although I am from Beijing, I don't have any property at home, and I have always moved from east to west before liberation. At that time, renting a house was really at the mercy of the landlord. Prices rose every day, and rents rose steadily. Sometimes the rent was calculated in terms of rice, sometimes in terms of millet, and sometimes in terms of flour; and it was not calculated according to the official price, but according to the private price. You said, how difficult it is! Now that I am moving, I no longer have to ask grandpa to tell grandma to find a house myself, and I no longer have to suffer the injustice of the landlord. Take my move this time as an example, the government has really taken care of us in every possible way. We didn't have to pay a penny for the moving expenses; everything in the mansion was arranged for us, and even the lampshades and light bulbs were installed. The house I live in now is many times more beautiful than the old house I used to live in. Look, the red brick walls, the white plastered walls, how beautiful. This house has screen doors and windows, a balcony, and a flush toilet, everything is complete, but the rent is cheaper than when I lived in a bungalow before. The benefits are not limited to these, the cooperative has also been opened under the No. 4 building where I live. Residents of the twenty-one buildings in our Happiness Mansion can buy oil, salt, firewood, rice, cloth, pastries, and all kinds of daily necessities just a few steps out of the door, how convenient! Living in such a house, how can I not be happy?

　　I am an old Beijinger, I know that the area where we live in Happiness Mansion was originally empty land; but you see, now in addition to our twenty-one Happiness Mansions, more than a dozen new houses have been built recently, foreign-style houses are connected one after another, and flowers and plants have been planted in front of the houses, how big is this change! This area has changed, and Diaoyu Hutong, where we originally lived, has also changed. On September 11th this year, the government organized us old residents to visit that place. As soon as we walked there, ah, where is the shadow of our dilapidated house, what we saw was our beautiful new railway station! When I heard the staff introduce that such a beautiful station was built in just over eight months, I was deeply moved. I know that this is a miracle that can only be created in our new China, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, in this era of the Great Leap Forward!

　　Without the Great Leap Forward, Where Would the Great Hall of the People Come From?

　　Hou Shiqiang (66 years old, male, health committee member of the residents' committee):

　　I used to be a railway worker and am considered an old resident of Beijing. In the area in front of Tiananmen Square where the Great Hall of the People is now located, there used to be a Qianfu Hutong. My family has lived in that hutong since 1900. It was an old house built more than a hundred years ago, with a total of twelve rooms. The house looks not small, and it is brick-covered from the outside, but inside it is completely made of broken bricks and mud. In the past, most ordinary Beijingers lived in such houses, and they were afraid of the house collapsing whenever it was cloudy and rainy. It has been like this for sixty years. Now that our dilapidated house has been demolished, I myself live in a new mansion, and the country has built the Great Hall of the People in the place where we originally lived in a short period of time. This is really beneficial to the country and to ourselves.

　　Not long after we moved, the Great Hall of the People was built all at once. On October 6th, we were given a tour ticket, specially to entertain the old residents who originally lived there. On the day of the tour, it was originally said that it was best not to bring children, because there were many people that day, and the children were too young, afraid that they would run around inside, which was difficult to manage; but everyone still brought their whole families. In this way, adults, children, old ladies... that happy energy, that goes without saying. Everyone watched and discussed, and was reluctant to leave quickly at every place. They went in from 1:00 pm and didn't come out until 6:00 pm, but they didn't feel tired at all. Everyone said that this is the Great Hall of the People of the whole country, our big family. It would be great if the people's representatives we elected could hold meetings there and discuss doing more good things for us! Where would such a Great Hall of the People come from without the Great Leap Forward?

　　These two days I have also been thinking: Now the conference of heroes is being held in the Great Hall of the People, and these heroes in national construction will surely be encouraged when they see that the workers and masses of Beijing have built this Great Hall of the People so quickly in the Great Leap Forward. After the heroes go back, they will definitely be able to muster even greater efforts to produce and build for the people.

　　Living Younger and Younger

　　Zhi Yuqin (71 years old, housewife):

　　A few days ago, I went to the Beijing Railway Station for a stroll. Hey, what a big and beautiful house. I used to be an old resident of this area (I originally lived in Jiangca Hutong), and I am even more happy to see such a good new station. I immediately thought of a song we loved to sing in the early days of liberation—"Our Workers Have Strength," in a line: "Remodeling the world, has it changed? It has changed." Really, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our China is really changing day by day. The Longxugou where I first lived, the stinking ditch there has long been filled, new houses have been built, and flowers and plants have been planted, becoming as beautiful as a small garden; the low and dilapidated houses in Jiangca Hutong are now gone, and such a good new station has been built. These things are so touching and inspiring!

　　Not only has the surrounding environment changed, but even people have changed. Take me, an old woman, as an example, my husband died when I was twenty-eight years old, and I was empty-handed, with not a tile on top and not an inch of land below, and I had to raise a child, it was simply impossible to live. I could only suffer and work hard, sometimes doing needlework for people, sometimes working as a nanny for people. At that time, I was so tired all day long, serving the masters, my legs were swollen, and my waist was sore, and I had to eat angry meals and be despised as an "old nanny"; but as soon as I was liberated, my waist straightened up. I participated in cultural studies, and also participated in street work, and was also rated as a five-good activist in the street, and was rewarded and commended by the government. Who doesn't respect me, who doesn't call me "Auntie" when they see me!

　　I am already seventy-one years old, but I feel that I am living younger and younger. After moving to Happiness Mansion, I still serve as the residents' group leader and security committee member. This area is large, and there are many people, and my responsibility is even heavier; I run around all day long, busy with this and that. But I don't feel tired at all when I work. After finishing work, I always like to chat with young daughters-in-law about family matters. I am a person who has suffered, and I know how to live a rich life frugally, so I often tell them the principles of thrift and saving. I always point to our Happiness Mansion and say: "Let's save some money and save it, so that the country can have funds to build more and better Happiness Mansions."

　　National Construction is for Us

　　Wang Guiping (59 years old, female):

　　The old society is clearly black and white compared to now. The reactionary government in the past never built a tile or a room for the people. At that time, the people's lives were hard, their lives were unstable, and they couldn't take care of what they lived in, let alone travel everywhere. For example, although I graduated from middle school in the past, I couldn't find a job, so I had to be a housewife. My husband was a middle school teacher, and he was always worried about being fired. As a result, he was fired on the eve of liberation. Fortunately, the Communist Party came, and our lives became stable and improved day by day.

　　Now everyone has a job, life is getting better day by day, everyone is happy, and everyone wants to go to the park to play on holidays. The government knows this wish of the masses, so it builds parks and flattens roads for us, so that everyone has a place to play and walks easily. For the sake of the masses, the country is so thoughtful, national construction is all for us.

　　How Happy it is to be a Beijinger!

　　De Shuzhen (41 years old, female, director of the residents' committee):

　　I am an old Beijinger, and for forty years, I have never left the area of Zhantansi. In the first thirty years, in addition to my life becoming more and more difficult, the houses and streets I saw in front of me did not change much, just like the whole of Beijing that I saw, only the houses became more and more ancient, and the streets became more and more dilapidated. Since liberation, in the last ten years, the situation has been very different. Beijing doesn't know how many houses have been built and how many roads have been repaired. It is really changing day by day, becoming more and more beautiful. I can actually move out of a small house and live in a high-rise building, and I feel unspeakably happy in my heart.

　　In May and June last year, when the government mobilized us to relocate, when I first heard that I was going to move to the outside of the city, I muttered in my heart: The outside of the city is barren and desolate, far away from Beihai, and it is inconvenient to buy things and visit parks, but for the construction of the capital, we should move. I was feeling uneasy in my heart, but the comrades of the street office came to invite us to visit several newly built buildings, one was Xinglong Street outside the Dongsi Shitiao Gap, one was Hongmaogou outside Fuchengmen, and the other was Happiness Avenue outside Guangqumen where I live now. After I visited, I saw that the houses were good everywhere, and the transportation was convenient everywhere, and I wanted to live everywhere. Later, we held a family meeting and decided to choose a place closer to where the child works, so we moved to Happiness Mansion.

　　Living here, the environment is much quieter than in the city, but it is not a barren wilderness. You see, there are twenty-one buildings in our Happiness Mansion alone, the dormitory of the Sports Commission is in the south, and the 24th Middle School is in the north, and there are countless scaffolding for building houses around, isn't it becoming more and more lively? Although it is farther from Beihai Park, it is closer to Longtan Lake. In summer, I like to take the children to the lake for a walk or read a book, and I feel very comfortable! Now that I live comfortably myself, the area of Zhantansi, like here, is constantly appearing with high-rise buildings and constantly building large roads, so that more people can move out of the dilapidated houses of decades or hundreds of years ago, and let us walk on a smoother and wider road. Now I am increasingly feeling how happy it is to be a Beijinger!

　　I was the First to Approve of Building the Station

　　Auntie Liu (56 years old, female):

　　My family originally lived inside Dongbianmen, and only moved to Happiness Mansion last October. In the past, we lived in two small mud houses. Needless to say, the mansion we live in now is not spacious and bright, but it is also not as convenient to get water and for the children to go to school as it is now. At that time, getting water meant going outside Bianmen to fetch it, and letting the children carry the water buckets across the railway was really worrying; the children also had to cross the railway to go to school, and we had to worry about them several times a day.

　　Last year, the People's Government said that Beijing was going to build a large railway station and lay some new railways, which would occupy the place where we lived, and asked us if we would like to move. I said, why wouldn't we? After moving, we wouldn't have to worry about the children. Besides, I was the first to approve of the country building a large station. I used to live in Renqiu County, Hebei. My husband worked in a coal shop in Beijing. Every year after the autumn harvest, when I had nothing to do in the countryside, I always came to Beijing to see him. Needless to say, before liberation, I suffered a lot from Renqiu to here! After liberation, although the conductors on the train and when getting on and off the train took good care of us old ladies, I always felt a little crowded in the Qianmen Station, especially now that people's lives have improved, and state cadres are doing more things for the people, and more and more people are catching the train. I had long wanted to have a large station, which would be the icing on the cake.

　　It has been less than a year since we moved, and such a large station has been built. After the station was built, the People's Government specially invited us to visit. On the day I went to see the new station, I was so happy that I couldn't close my mouth when I saw that the new station was so beautiful and spacious. Now everyone can wait for the train, rest, and get on and off the train easily. Needless to say, it is comfortable for the elderly and children to go out or come to Beijing, and it is also a blessing for young people with a lot of luggage and women with inconvenient bodies to catch the train!

### 矮房变大厦  人间建天堂

    矮房变大厦  人间建天堂
    北京市崇文区有一个幸福村。解放以前，这一片地是腐臭的苇塘和荒凉的坟地；解放以后，才盖了房屋，修了马路——幸福大街。幸福村里有二十一幢一式的红砖大楼，是去年春天动工、去年9月份内陆续建成的，人们叫他幸福大楼。北京市兴建许多新建筑的时候，拆除了部分居民住房。这部分居民，在人民政府的妥善安排和照顾下，先后搬进幸福大楼居住了。
    右倾机会主义者诬蔑我们的大跃进是“小资产阶级狂热性”，诬蔑我们的许多新建设是“劳民伤财”。他们同我们站在不同的立场，所以有不同的感情，讲不同的话。现在，我们来听一听那些在原来住在新建筑的土地上的居民们的感想，就可以看到右倾机会主义者同广大人民群众的思想感情是相距多远啊！　　　　　——编者
    大跃进带来更好的生活
    姜慧贞（三十八岁，家庭妇女街道积极分子，挑补花生产小组组长）：
    我家原来住在南城根十四号，就是现在北京新车站那里。在那儿租房子住了十一年，去年11月才迁到幸福大楼来的。提起搬到大楼，我真要说个没完，你不知道政府照顾得有多周到。居民小组长领我们看了新大楼，还征求我们意见愿不愿搬。我说为了支援国家建设，我能力低，出不了什么力，搬家事决不迟延，说搬就搬。何况政府给我们预备了这样好的大楼房。后来搬房子，一文搬家费也没叫我们自己花，搬家时有的人家孩子出疹子，政府还叫小汽车送，怕孩子受风。搬好了又来调查搬家有没有损失，损失的东西照价赔偿。你不要还不依。同志，你看政府哪一样不为老百姓、不为第二代着想？要在旧社会会有这回子事吗？
    就拿房子来说吧！大楼房子干净利落、卫生设备齐全不说，政府还照顾你家里人身体好坏，老人和小孩，工作地点远近，家庭经济情况，请你自愿选择适合的地点、房屋，有困难还尽量设法帮助解决。所以搬来的没有不称心如意的，都高兴得很。像我们家四口人，因为有老人，就给了二层楼的一套三间，还有厕所、厨房、小凉台。每逢下大雨，我就想起过去，屋外下大雨，屋里下小雨，院子洼坑大，厨房里积着比脚背还高的水，做饭还得撑伞穿高统套靴，煤球、柴火不知往那里放着好的滋味，和现在一比，真是天上地下。你想：我心里感不感谢毛主席。要不是共产党的好领导，我们那会有今天。过去国民党统治不要说不给楼房住，给住我也不敢住，出不起房租押金呀！搬家以后常有些老亲老戚来走动，我总要带他们看我们的房子，介绍搬家的情况。每天我从窗子里往外一看，我们四周新的一幢比一幢漂亮的楼房都建立起来了，心里真高兴呵！
    日子越过越好，作街道工作的劲也就越大，群众工作也越来越顺手了。拿搬家以后绿化来说吧！原来院子里大块石、小块砖，坑坑洼洼，可一号召绿化庭园，多种树好乘凉，大家都积极参加。老的小的都来种。老太太们说：老婆婆没有大力量，有小力量。干部们星期天也牺牲休息来栽树。你看我们院子里小树都长得多高了。为了迎接国庆，我们又栽了好些花，小孩子也帮忙浇水，一个个院子收拾得都像小花园了。坐在那里心里真舒坦。听说，北京市居民的绿化工作我们还数第一哩！
    前些时，妹妹来北京，我去新车站接她，那里哪是一年前我住过的破旧样子呀！现在变得完全是两个世界了。车站走进去就像进了水晶宫一样，到处亮光闪闪，柱子又高又大，玻璃灯各式各样，还有最新式的电梯，瞅那儿那儿漂亮，瞅那儿那儿满意。我乐开了，妹妹也看个不停，笑得合不拢嘴。她说这一辈子还没见过这样的车站。我们还特地去看了母子候车室，嘿！真叫好，有各式各样的婴儿床，还铺上了油布垫子，还给孩子们预备了好多玩具，服务员随时都来打扫和照顾旅客。妹妹说：如今的孩子真叫有福气，我看他们在候车室都会玩得不想走了。我们两个高兴的不得了，我看其他旅客也是一样，一进车站满处瞅，满脸的笑。从车站就可以看出来我们国家社会主义建设的伟大。像这样的建筑我们还需要很多呵！所以现在党号召的反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约真是应该。老话说，水滴石穿，聚沙成塔，我看是有道理。我自己文化水平不高。能力又低，做不了什么大事，我一定要努力做好街道工作，领导好挑补花生产小组，来报答毛主席、共产党。
    大跃进里出奇迹
    王锦芳（四十二岁，家庭妇女）：
    我原来住的地方——钓饵胡同三号，已经拆除修盖北京车站了。我是去年12月里搬进幸福大楼的。提起搬房子，我真是伤透了脑筋。我虽然是北京人，但家里没有房产，解放前老是东搬西搬的。那时候租房子可受房东的气啦。物价天天涨，房租节节高，房租一会要按大米算，一会要按小米算，一会要按白面算；而且不按官价合，要按私价合。你说，那多刁难人！现在我搬家，却再不用自己求爷爷告奶奶地去找房子了，也再不受房东那份儿冤气了。就拿我这次搬家来说吧，政府对我们真是照顾得无微不至。搬家费没让我们出一角钱；大楼里什么都给我们安置得好好的，连灯罩、电灯泡都给装上了。我现在住的房子，比起从前那老房子来，不晓得要漂亮多少倍。瞧，红砖墙，白粉壁，多好看呀。这房子，有纱门纱窗，有阳台、有抽水马桶，诸事齐备，可房租比以前住平房时还便宜哩。好处还不止这些，我住的四号楼底下，还开办了合作社，我们幸福大楼里二十一幢楼房的居民，油盐柴米、布匹糕点和各种各样日用品，出了门走不几步就可以买到，多方便呀！住着这样的房子，我心里能不痛快吗？
    我是老北京，我知道，现在咱们住的幸福大楼这一带，原来都是空地；可是你瞧，现在除了有了咱们这二十一幢幸福大楼外，最近又新盖了十几幢房子，洋房一幢连一幢，房子前面还种上了花草，这变化是多大呀！这一带地方变了，咱们原来住的那钓饵胡同也变了。今年9月11日，政府组织咱们这些老居民去参观那地方。一走去，啊，哪还有咱们那破旧房子的影儿，看到的却是咱们那漂亮透顶的新车站啦！当我听工作人员介绍说，这么漂亮的车站，是用不过八个月的时间盖成的，我心里直感动。我知道，这是只有在咱们新中国，在党和毛主席的领导下，在这大跃进的时代，才可能创造的奇迹！
    不是大跃进，哪有大会堂？
    侯世强　（六十六岁，男，居民委员会卫生委员）：
    我原来是个铁路工人，算是北京的老住户了。在现在天安门前人民大会堂那片地方，原来有一条前府胡同。从1900年起，我们家就住在那条胡同里。那是一百多年前修的一幢古老房子，一共十二间。房子看来还不小，从外面看是砖盖的，可是里面却完全是碎砖头同泥糊起来的，过去普通北京人住的房子大都就是这样的房子，每逢天阴下雨就怕塌房。就这样一直过了六十年。现在把我们那个破房子拆了，我自己住上了新大楼，国家也在短短的时间里在我们原来住的那片地方修好了人民大会堂。这真是对国家，对自己都有好处。
    搬了家还没有多久，人民大会堂一下子就盖起来了。10月6日那天给我们发了一张参观票，专门招待原来住在那里的老住户去参观。参观那天，原来说是最好不要带孩子去，因为那天人很多，孩子太小，怕他们在里面乱跑乱跳，不好管；可是大家还是把全家都带去了。这样一来，大人、小孩、老太太……那个乐劲儿，那就不用说了。大家边看、边议论，每处都留恋着不愿很快离开，从下午一点钟进去，一直走到六点钟才出来，可是一点也不觉累。大伙都说，这是全国人民的大礼堂，是我们的大家庭，以后让我们自己选出的人民代表在那里开会，商量替咱们办更多的好事，这该多好呢！这样的大会堂，要不是大跃进，从哪儿来？
    这两天我也想：现在在大会堂里正在开群英会，这些在国家建设中的英雄们看到北京的工人和群众在大跃进中这么快就修好了这个大会堂，一定会得到鼓舞。英雄回去后也一定能鼓出更大的劲来为人民生产和建设。
    越活越年青
    志玉琴　（七十一岁，家庭妇女）：
    前些日子，我到北京车站去逛了一趟。嗬，多大多漂亮的房子啊。我过去是这一带的老居民（我原来住在江擦胡同），看到这样好的新车站，更是高兴万分。我立刻想到解放初期咱们爱唱的一个歌——“咱们工人有力量”里的一句词儿：改造那世界变了么变了样。真的，在共产党、毛主席的领导下，咱们中国真是一天一个样儿的在变着哩。我最早住过的龙须沟，那儿的臭沟早已填平，盖上了新房，种上了花草，变得像小花园一样美了；江擦胡同这一片低矮破烂了的房现又不见了，盖起了这么好的新车站。这些事情多么叫人感动振奋呀！
    不光周围的环境变了，连人也变了。就拿我这老婆子来说吧，我二十八岁上死了丈夫，自己两手空空，上无一片瓦，下无一寸地，还要拉扯一个孩子，简直没有办法生活。我只能苦吃苦做，一会给人做针线活，一会给人做保姆。那时候，成天累得死去活来，侍候老爷太太，腿都站肿了，腰都累酸了，还要吃受气饭，被人家轻视地称为“老妈子”；可是打一解放，我的腰就伸直了。我参加了文化学习，又参加了街道工作，还被评为街道的五好积极分子，受到了政府的奖励表扬。哪个不尊敬我，哪个不看见就叫我一声大妈！
    我已经七十一岁了，可是我却觉得自己越活越年青。搬到幸福大楼来了以后，我仍担任居民小组长和治安委员。这一带地方大，人多，我的责任也更重了；成天东奔西跑，忙这忙那。但是我工作起来一点也不觉得累。搞完工作以后我还总爱找年青媳妇扯扯家常。我是受过苦的人，知道怎样精打细算地过富日子，因此我就经常告诉她们勤俭持家节约储蓄的道理。我总爱指着咱们的幸福大楼说：“咱们节省些过日子，把钱储蓄起来，让国家能有资金盖更多更好的幸福大楼。”
    国家建设为了咱
    王桂平（五十九岁，女）：
    旧社会与现在比真是黑白分明。过去的反动政府从来不为人民群众兴盖一片瓦，一间房。那时候，群众生活苦，生活不安定，也顾不上住什么，更谈不上到各处游玩。比如我过去虽然是中学毕业，可是找不到职业，只好作家庭妇女，我的爱人是中学教员，整天就担心被解雇，结果还是在解放前夕被人解雇了。幸亏来了共产党，我们的生活才安定下来，而且一天天地提高。
    现在人人都有了工作，生活一天比一天好，大家心里愉快，一到假日都愿意到公园去玩玩，政府知道群众这份心，所以为咱们修公园、平马路，让大家有玩的地方，走起路来也松快。为了群众，国家想得多么周到，国家建设都是为了咱。
    作个北京人多么幸福！
    德淑珍　（四十一岁，女，居民委员会主任）：
    我是老北京，四十年来，就没有离开过旃坛寺那一片。前三十年，除了我的生活愈来愈艰难以外，我眼前所见到的房屋和街道，都没有什么变化，就如同我所看到的整个北京一样，只是房屋愈来愈古老了，街道愈来愈破旧了。打解放后，最近这十年呀，情况可就大不相同了。北京不知道盖了多少房子，修了多少马路，真是一天一个样，一天比一天漂亮，我也居然能够从矮小的屋子里搬出来，住上了高楼大厦，心里真是说不出的痛快。
    去年5、6月里，政府动员我们拆迁的时候，我乍一听说要搬到城外去，心里就嘀咕：城外荒郊旷野的，离北海又远，买东西和逛公园都不方便了，可是为了首都建设，我们又应该搬。心里正在那里七上八下的，可巧街道办事处的同志们就来请我们到几处新修好的大楼去参观，有东四十条豁口外兴隆街一处，有阜城门外红茂沟一处，还有现在我家住的广渠门外幸福大街这一处。我参观了以后，看到哪儿的房子都好，哪儿的交通都方便，处处都想去住。后来还是我们开了一个家庭会，决定挑一处离孩子工作的地点比较近的去住，所以我们就搬到幸福大楼。
    住在这里，环境是比在城里时安静多了，可并不是荒郊旷野。你瞧，单咱们这幸福大楼就有二十一幢，南边有体委的宿舍，北边还有二十四中，四周还有数不清的正在盖房的脚手架，这不是愈来愈热闹了么？这儿虽然离北海公园远一些，可是离龙潭湖近，夏天我就爱领着孩子们到湖边去散散步，或看看书，心里可自在啦！现在我自己住得舒服了，而旃坛寺一带也像这里一样不断地出现高楼大厦，不断地修建大马路，让更多的人从几十年前、几百年前的破房子里搬出来，让我们走的道更平坦宽广，我现在真是愈来愈感到作个北京人是多么幸福呀！
    修车站我第一个赞成
    刘大娘　（五十六岁，女）：
    我家原来住在东便门里，去年10月才搬到幸福大楼来的。过去住的是两间矮小的泥房，不用说没有现在住的这个大楼房宽敞亮堂，就是吃水和孩子上学也没有这会方便。那时候，吃点水得到便门外去挑，让孩子们挑着水桶穿过铁道，真是让人提心吊胆；孩子们去上学，也是要穿过铁道，天天都得为他们担几回心。
    去年人民政府说北京要修大火车站，和铺一些新铁路，要占用咱住的地方，问我们愿不愿搬家，我说，咋不愿意哩？搬了家，就不会为孩子担这份心了。再说，国家要修大车站，我第一个赞成。早先我是住在河北任丘县的，我的老伴在北京煤铺作事，每年大秋完了我在乡下没事的时候总短不了到北京来看看，不用提解放前从任丘到这儿要受多少罪啦！解放以后，虽说在车上和上下车都有列车员好好照顾我们老太太了，可是在前门车站里总感到有些挤，尤其是现在人们的生活提高了，国家干部为人民办的事情也多了，赶火车的人也就愈来愈多。我早想要是有个大车站，就是锦上添花了。
    我们搬家还不到一年，就修好这么个大车站。车站修好后，人民政府还特别请我们去参观。我去看新车站那天，瞅着新车站又漂亮又宽敞，真是乐得合不拢嘴。现在大伙等车休息和上车下车都很松快，不用说老年人和小孩出个门或上北京来都得劲了，就是带行李多的青年人和身子不方便的妇女要赶火车也享福了呀！
