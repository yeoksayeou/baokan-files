    Prague Dispatch: “Rude Pravo” published an editorial on the 15th commemorating the second anniversary of the signing of two historic documents (the Declaration of the Representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the Peace Manifesto) in Moscow by representatives of the Communist and Workers' parties of various countries. The editorial pointed out that these two documents are of extremely significant importance to the cause of peace and socialism. These documents demonstrated the necessity of peaceful coexistence among nations and explained the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system based on profound Marxist-Leninist analysis.

    Although it has not been long since the publication of these two documents, this period has been filled with events that prove their correctness. How effective has the economic, political, and moral superiority of socialism over capitalism been on international development!

    The editorial emphasized that the Declaration of the Representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the Peace Manifesto signed in Moscow two years ago are clear evidence and reflections of the rock-solid unity of the Communist and Workers' parties of various countries on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, and are a victory for proletarian internationalism.

    The attempts by modern revisionists to smuggle enemy ideological Trojan horses into the socialist camp and to provoke ideological differences have met with shameful failure. Even professional slanderers against our countries have had to admit that the socialist countries are a powerful and solid camp in economic, ideological, and political terms, and any hostile attacks will be shattered by the strength of this camp.

    The editorial talked about the great achievements made by the socialist countries in various aspects of their economic and cultural development in the past two years, and about the broad prospects for the future.

    The editorial said that this once again brilliantly proves the superiority of socialism over capitalism. The editorial also emphasized the historical significance of Khrushchev's visit to the United States in further easing international tensions and ensuring peaceful coexistence among nations.

    Tirana Dispatch: "Zeri i Popullit" published a commentary on the 21st commemorating the second anniversary of the Moscow Conference. The commentary said: "Practice and life in the two years since the publication of the documents of the Moscow Conference have proved that it is completely correct."

    The commentary then described the achievements made by the Soviet Union and the socialist countries in the past two years, saying: "All of this proves the vitality of our Marxist-Leninist ideology and its undoubted superiority over decadent capitalism."

    The commentary said: "The Meeting of Representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries pointed out that revisionism is the main danger at present. In the past two years, due to the consistent and principled struggle waged by the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries headed by the Soviet Union, the conspiracies of modern revisionism headed by Yugoslavia have been exposed and isolated one after another. But this does not mean that the struggle against modern revisionism, especially against Yugoslav revisionism, has ended. On the contrary, they will continue to struggle until this sinister and cunning enemy of Marxism-Leninism, peace, and communism is completely bankrupt ideologically."

    The commentary concluded: "In the past, present and future, the historical documents of the Moscow Conference will always be a great program for the work and struggle of the Communist and Workers' parties of all countries, and will always be a great program for progress, democracy and socialism. The Albanian Party of Labor will always faithfully implement the tasks of the historical documents of the Moscow Conference, and it will tirelessly work to further consolidate the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to consolidate the unity of the world communist movement with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union founded by the great Lenin as its core. It resolutely opposes revisionism and enemies of all colors, and struggles to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism. It will fight to the end for the victory of our great socialist and peaceful cause."

    捷阿报纸纪念莫斯科会议宣言签署两周年
    和平和社会主义事业前景无限光明
    本报讯　布拉格消息：“红色权利报”15日发表社论，纪念各国共产党和工人党代表在莫斯科签署两个历史性文件（社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言与和平宣言）两周年。社论指出：这两个文件对和平和社会主义事业的非常重大的意义，在这两个文件中论证了各国和平共处的必要性并且在深刻的马克思列宁主义分析的基础上说明社会主义制度对资本主义制度的优越性。
    虽然这两个文件公布后时间并不久，但是在这段时间里却充满了证明这些文件正确性的事件。社会主义在经济上、政治上和道义上对资本主义的优越性对国际发展起了多么卓有成效的影响！
    社论强调指出，两年前在莫斯科签署的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言与和平宣言是各国共产党和工人党在马克思列宁主义基础上磐石般团结的明证和反映，是无产阶级国际主义的胜利。
    现代修正主义者想在社会主义阵营内部偷运敌对思想意识的特洛伊木马和挑起思想分歧的企图遭到了可耻的失败。甚至反对我们这些国家的职业诽谤者也不得不承认，社会主义各国在经济上、思想上和政治上是一个强大的坚如磐石的阵营，任何敌对的攻击都要被这个阵营的力量碰得粉碎。
    社论谈到了社会主义各国两年来在它们的经济和文化发展的各个方面所取得的巨大成就，谈到了今后广阔的前景。
    社论说，这再一次光辉地证明了社会主义对资本主义的优越性。社论还强调指出赫鲁晓夫访问美国对进一步缓和国际紧张局势和保障各国和平共处的历史意义。
    本报讯　地拉那消息：“人民之声报”21日发表了一篇评论，纪念莫斯科会议两周年。评论说：“莫斯科会议的文件公布两年来实践和生活已证明了它是完全正确的。”
    评论接着叙述了苏联和社会主义各国两年来所获得的成就后说：“所有这一些都证明了我们马克思列宁主义思想的生气勃勃和它毫无疑问地优越于腐朽的资本主义。”
    评论说：“社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议指出修正主义是目前的主要危险。两年来由于以苏联为首的各国共产党和工人党进行了一贯的原则性的斗争，以南斯拉夫为首的现代修正主义的阴谋已一个接着一个被揭露和孤立了。但这并不意味着反对现代修正主义、特别是反对南斯拉夫修正主义的斗争已经结束，相反地他们将继续斗争，直到马克思列宁主义、和平和共产主义的这一险恶的诡诈的敌人从思想上完全破产为止”。
    评论最后说：“过去、现在和将来，莫斯科会议的历史文件永远是各国共产党和工人党工作和斗争的伟大纲领，永远是进步、民主和社会主义的伟大的纲领。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党永远忠诚地执行莫斯科会议历史文件的任务，它将不倦地为进一步巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，为巩固以伟大的列宁建立起来的苏联共产党为核心的世界共产主义运动的团结而努力。它坚决地反对修正主义和各色的敌人，为保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性而斗争。为了我们伟大的社会主义和和平事业的胜利，它将斗争到底。”
