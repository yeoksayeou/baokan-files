    Glory to the People's Liberation Army Heroes on the Construction Front!
    By our reporters Zhou Zemin, Jiang Qingzhao, Zhou Changzong
    In the years of war and turmoil, countless heroic soldiers of the People's Liberation Army set a brilliant example for us. They used their blood, bravery, and wisdom to write colorful poems. Today, in the days of peaceful construction, they are still a group of heroic tigers, adding bricks and tiles to the socialist edifice of the motherland and creating immortal feats.
    Those who have experienced war understand the loveliness of construction even more. The People's Liberation Army soldiers are full of passion for the construction of the great motherland. They want to work with the people of the motherland to quickly change the "poor and blank" face and move towards happiness and prosperity. The PLA heroes sitting in the ranks of more than 6,000 heroes in the Great Hall of the People, and their great achievements, are the most vivid embodiment of the lofty ideals and revolutionary vigor of the entire army.
    Writing the First Chapter of "Old Soldiers, New Stories"
    Lieutenant Wu Tiliang, the company commander of the "Tiger Company," came from the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau on the Mindian Railway construction site. He brought us the dual merits of a heroic company in combat and construction. The famous "Tiger Company" became famous in the Taihang Mountains and Lüliang Mountains during the War of Resistance Against Japan. It once defeated the rampant attack of more than 200 Japanese devils with a platoon of troops, and won the award flag of "attacking like a tiger, defending like Mount Tai." Since then, it has been called the "Tiger Company" by the people. For more than 20 years, this heroic company has crossed the Yellow River, crossed the Yangtze River, fought in fourteen provinces, and went straight to the border of Yunnan to defend the country. In the spring of 1958, the general line of the Party's socialist construction and the glory of the Great Leap Forward shone in the hearts of the soldiers. The "Tiger Company" marched thousands of miles into the Wumeng Mountains, determined to plant a red flag for participating in construction, and shine together with the more than 30 red flags of combat.
    The hands of the soldiers who were used to holding guns now picked up hammers, steel drills, and wind drills to fight against nature and write the first chapter of "Old Soldiers, New Stories." They took on the task of opening up the Wumeng Mountain Tunnel, which lies across the Nei (Jiang) Kun (Ming) line of the Mindian Railway, and worked with fraternal troops to excavate the 2,565-meter-long "underground corridor." There were many difficulties: they didn't know how to use wind drills to make holes, load explosives and fire cannons, let alone build roadways... They didn't know anything, but difficulties couldn't stop the heroes. They "learned while doing, and did while learning." After several months of hard work, they knew everything. All officers and soldiers in the company generally mastered more than one technique for tunnel operations, trained 44 wind gunners, and half of them became "all-rounders." The "Tiger Company" attacked the stubborn rocks of the high mountains. Day and night, the company commander stayed on the front lines, and the soldiers stuck to their posts. The daily progress of one meter was quickly increased to two meters, three meters, and the company created new records of "red in every class, red every day," and in May of this year, it leaped to create a new record of 21 meters per day and 123 meters per month on the entire line, holding high the red flag of the vanguard of the Great Leap Forward.
    Breaking into the Scientific "Forbidden Zone"
    In battle, only the bravest are the smartest and most intelligent; in construction, soldiers with soaring energy are also the most creative. They dare to overcome dangers and difficulties, dare to break with convention, and constantly leap forward. Since the Great Leap Forward, how many technical innovation warriors in the People's Liberation Army have broken into the scientific "forbidden zone" and created unprecedented miracles! China's first "frog-type diesel pile driver" was created by Feng Pilian, a lieutenant in the Railway Corps with only a junior high school education. This pile driver can move forward in a stable straight line, hitting 100 to 150 times per minute, with an hourly work efficiency of about 7,000 square meters, which is more than ten times faster than manual pile driving. Its appearance will fundamentally change the appearance of pile driving in China's railway construction. In the past, woodworking operations such as planing and sawing seemed to be the law. However, Ma Jinde, an ordinary carpenter at the Nanjing Military Supplies Factory, under the slogan of "arming oneself," took the lead in launching a courageous attack towards the goal of realizing woodworking mechanization. He created more than a dozen kinds of machines, such as electric planers, double-wheel automatic sawing machines, and electric chisels, which mechanized 70% of the manual woodworking operations and could complete 20 years of work in one year. Here, there are also heroes who "move mountains." Zhu Zhongjie, a young captain of the Railway Corps, broke into the forefront of China's large blasting technology. This young engineer, who knew nothing about blasting technology six years ago, can make mountains that have been sleeping for thousands of years automatically fly to designated locations as needed, forming roadbeds or reservoir dams. In August of last year, in a directional blasting at the exit of the Songlin Tunnel in the Wumeng Mountain area of ​​the Neikun Line, he designed, more than 50,000 cubic meters of rock accurately fell within the fill range. This year, in a blasting of more than 90,000 cubic meters of rock in Hunan, he specified that the stones blasted from the excavation be split into two, filling the roadbeds at both ends, and achieved complete success.
    Can people imagine a sewing machine with thirteen needles working at the same time? Wang Dacheng, a maintenance worker at the PLA Military Supplies Factory, created seven-needle, nine-needle, and thirteen-needle multi-needle quilting machines. Put a well-laid cotton coat or cotton trouser piece on it, and just press a button, and a finished product with seven, nine, or thirteen rows will be quilted in one go.
    Creation is born from overcoming countless difficulties. The process of Wang Dacheng's creation of a multi-needle quilting machine fully demonstrates the invincible perseverance of the People's Liberation Army soldiers. At the beginning, he failed. He heard cold words such as "If he can do it, I can fly to the sky," and he also had the idea that "small ants can't gnaw big bones, we are not the material for creating machines." However, he overcame all these emotions of loosening up from within and external stimuli, and insisted on fighting with the fearless spirit of more effort in the face of more difficulties. He thought about it during the day and at night, and sometimes he was too lazy to eat and couldn't sleep. He often got up in the middle of the night to draw sketches and went to the workshop late at night to experiment. He said: "Communists should attack in the face of difficulties, and attack bravely!" The attack drove away countless difficult days and nights for Wang Dacheng, and the honor of creating the country's first thirteen-head multi-needle quilting machine was finally won by Wang Dacheng.
    Caring for Others More Than Caring for Oneself
    Our soldiers are not only brave innovators, but also people with a communist spirit of cooperation and a beautiful sentiment of caring for others more than caring for themselves. They regard the difficulties of others as their own, and take pride in standing in the most dangerous and difficult positions. They immediately tell their competitors about their advanced experiences, truly achieving "competition is the opponent, mutual assistance is the brother," and regard the common leap forward of everyone as their greatest happiness. Hong Qize, an engineer at the Research Institute of the Military Supplies Production Department of the General Logistics Department, when the Wuhan Textile Industry Administration lacked information for researching and manufacturing rayon, he unreservedly dedicated the results of his eight years of hard work. Zhang Baozhu, a 21-year-old female worker at a military supplies factory, not only often goes to work early and leaves the workshop late, doing a lot of cleaning work to create favorable conditions for the next shift, but also happily goes to the backward group to help them find the reasons for their backwardness, and leads this group to leap from often failing to complete the plan to a red flag group that fully completes the plan. The story of Wang Dacheng, the creator of the multi-needle quilting machine, donating his sewing machine to help the Wuhan Municipal Loading and Unloading Company's packaging and dressing cooperative to modify the sewing machine is even more touching. Wang Dacheng's family is not rich, and he does not know the people of the packaging and dressing cooperative. However, when he learned that in the days of the Great Leap Forward, manual bag sewing could not meet the needs of production development, and the dressing cooperative urgently needed a bag sewing machine, he enthusiastically went to the dressing cooperative every day after dinner to help modify the machine. When the dressing cooperative could not buy an old sewing machine, he modified his own 118-type electric sewing machine into a bag sewing machine and donated it, and refused remuneration. He said: "The machine was originally idle and a waste at home. Now let it be put into socialist construction, as a communist, shouldn't I?"
    This is the heroic temperament and noble style of our people's soldiers in the great construction cause of the motherland. This style makes the heroic image of the people's soldiers in the glorious era of the Great Leap Forward even fuller and taller.
    Glory! People's Liberation Army heroes on the construction front!

    光荣啊，建设战线上的解放军英雄！
    本报记者　周泽民　姜庆肇　周长宗
    战火纷飞的年代，人民解放军的无数英雄战士，为我们树立了光辉的榜样，他们用自己的鲜血、勇敢和智慧，写下了色彩万千的诗篇。今天，在和平建设的日子里，他们同样是一批英雄虎将，为祖国的社会主义大厦添砖加瓦，创造了光辉不灭的功勋。
    经历过战争的人，才更懂得建设的可爱。人民解放军战士，对伟大祖国的建设满怀激情，他们要同祖国人民一道，迅速改变“一穷二白”的面貌，走向幸福和繁荣。坐在人民大会堂六千多名英雄行列中的解放军英雄们，和他们的丰功伟迹，正是全军官兵这种崇高理想和革命干劲的最生动的体现。
    挥写“老兵新传”第一章
    “老虎连”连长吴体亮中尉从云贵高原闽滇大铁路工地上来。他为我们带来了一个英雄连队在战斗和建设中的双重功勋。著名的“老虎连”，在抗日战争年代就扬名太行山、吕梁山上，曾以一个排的兵力，杀败二百多名日本鬼子的猖狂进攻，荣获“攻如猛虎，守如泰山”的奖旗。从此，被人民称为“老虎连”。二十多年来，这个英雄连队，跨黄河，渡长江，转战十四省，直抵云南边疆，驻守国防。1958年春天，党的社会主义建设总路线和全民大跃进的光芒，照耀着战士的心。“老虎连”千里进军乌蒙山，决心要插一面参加建设的红旗，同三十多面战斗的红旗一起放射光辉。
    战士们拿惯了枪的手，现在又拿起了铁锤、钢钎和风镐，向大自然开战，挥写“老兵新传”第一章。他们担当了打通横在闽滇大铁路内（江）昆（明）线上的乌蒙山大隧道的任务，和兄弟部队一起，开挖全长二千五百六十五米的“地下长廊”。困难是很多的：他们既不会用风镐打眼，装炸药放炮，更不会砌筑道峒……一切都不会，然而困难挡不住英雄汉，他们“边学边干，边干边学”，苦战几个月，便一切都会了，全连官兵普遍掌握了隧道作业一门以上的技术，培养出四十四名风枪手，还有半数人成了“多面手”。“老虎连”攻进了高山顽岩中。日日夜夜，连长不离阵地，战士坚守岗位，从日成峒一米，很快提高到两米、三米，连创“班班红，日日红”，到今年5月，一跃而首创全线日成峒二十一米、月成峒一百二十三米的新纪录，高高举起了大跃进尖兵的红旗。
    闯进了科学“禁地”
    在战斗中，只有最勇敢的人才最聪明，最有智慧；在建设中，干劲冲天的战士也最富有无穷的创造力。他们勇于战胜艰险和困难，敢于打破常规，不断跃进。大跃进以来，解放军中有多少技术革新的勇将，闯进了科学的“禁地”，创造了亘古未有的奇迹啊！我国第一台“蛙式柴油打夯机”，是只有高小文化程度的铁道兵少尉冯丕廉创造的。这种打夯机能平稳地自行直线前进，每分钟夯击一百到一百五十次，每小时工效七千平方米左右，比人工打夯快十倍还多。它的出现，将根本改变我国铁路施工打夯面貌。在过去，木工作业推拉刨锯似乎已成定律。但是，南京军需工厂普通木工马进德在“自己武装自己”的口号下，首先发起了向实现木工机械化的目标的勇猛冲击。他创造了电刨子、双轮自动锯木机、电凿子等十多种机具，将70％的木工手工作业实现了机械化，一年可以完成二十年的工作量。这里，还有让“高山搬家”的英雄。年青的铁道兵上尉朱忠节闯进了我国大爆破技术的尖端。这位六年前对于爆破技术还一无所知的青年工程师，能叫千年沉睡的山峦按照需要自动飞向指定地点，形成路基或水库大坝。去年8月，他设计的内昆线乌蒙山地区的松林隧道出口的一次指向大爆破中，就使五万多方山石准确地落在填方范围以内。今年，他又在湖南九万多石方的一次爆破中，指定挖方炸起的石头一分两开，向两端填筑路基，获得了完全的成功。
    人们能够想像一部缝纫机上有十三个针头同时工作吗？解放军军需工厂保全工王大成就创造了七针、九针、十三针的多针纳花机。铺妥贴的棉衣片或棉裤片往上一放，只要一按电钮，一趟就纳成了七行、九行、十三行的成品。
    创造从克服无数困难中诞生。王大成创造多针纳花机的过程，充分表现了人民解放军战士无坚不摧的坚强毅力。开始，他失败了，听到过“他能搞成，我能上天”的冷言冷语，也产生过“小蚂蚁啃不了大骨头，咱不是创造机器的料”的想法。但是，他战胜了这一切来自自己内心的松劲情绪和外界的刺激，以困难越多，干劲越大的无畏精神坚持战斗下去。他白天想，晚上想，有时饭也懒得吃，觉也睡不着。常常半夜三更起来画草图，深夜走进车间去试验。他说：“共产党员在困难的面前，应该进攻，勇猛地进攻！”进攻，使王大成赶走了无数个困难的日日夜夜，创造祖国第一台十三头多针纳花机的荣誉，终于被王大成取得了。
    关心别人胜过关心自己
    我们的战士，不仅是一些勇于革新的闯将，而且也是一些具有共产主义协作精神和关怀别人胜过关心自己的美好情操的人。他们把别人的困难当作自己的困难，以站在最危险、最困难的岗位上为荣。他们一有先进经验马上告诉竞赛的对手，真正作到了“竞赛是对手，互助是兄弟”，把大家共同跃进看作自己最大的幸福。总后勤部军需生产部研究所工程师洪奇泽，当武汉纺织工业管理局研究制造人造丝缺乏资料时，他毫无保留地献出了自己八年辛勤研究的成果。二十一岁的军需工厂女工张宝珠，不但经常提前上班，迟出车间，大搞清洁工作，为下一班创造有利条件，而且愉快地站到落后的小组去，帮助她们找出落后原因，带动这个小组由经常完不成计划一跃而为全面完成计划的红旗小组。多针纳花机创造者王大成献出自己的缝纫机帮助武汉市装卸公司打包整装社改制缝包机的故事更加动人。王大成家庭并不富裕，而且和打包整装社的人素不相识。但是，当他知道在大跃进的日子里手工缝包不能适应生产发展的需要，整装社急需缝包机的事情以后，就满怀热情地每天吃过晚饭到整装社去帮忙改装机器。整装社买不到旧缝纫机，他便把自己的一台118型电动缝纫机改装成缝包机献了出来，并且拒绝报酬。他说：“机器原是闲着的，放在家也是浪费。现在让它投入社会主义建设，作为一个共产党员，难道不应该吗？”
    这就是我们人民战士在祖国伟大建设事业中的英雄气质和崇高风格。这种风格使人民战士在大跃进的光辉年代里的英雄形象更加丰满、高大了。
    光荣啊！建设战线上的解放军英雄！
