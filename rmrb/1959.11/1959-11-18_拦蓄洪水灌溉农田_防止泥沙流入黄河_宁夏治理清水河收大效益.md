    Retaining Floodwaters to Irrigate Farmland, Preventing Sediment from Entering the Yellow River:
    Ningxia's Governance of the Qingshui River Yields Great Benefits
    (Our Newspaper's report) The broad masses of Hui and Han people in the Qingshui River basin of the southern mountainous region of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are vigorously governing the Qingshui River, a major tributary of the Yellow River's middle reaches, by combining large-scale water conservancy with large-scale soil and water conservation.
    Now, this river, which has always been called a "pest river," has received tremendous benefits after more than a year of vigorous governance. This year, the eight large, medium, and small reservoir projects built within the basin, coupled with other soil and water conservation measures, have retained 180 million cubic meters of floodwater, preventing large amounts of sediment from entering the Yellow River, thereby playing a role in protecting the Sanmenxia Reservoir project. This winter and next spring, about 400,000 mu of farmland along the riverbanks will be irrigated.
    Since the Great Leap Forward began last year, the Hui and Han people, based on the natural characteristics of the river basin—serious drought and soil erosion disasters—and in order to develop mountain production, fundamentally control the Yellow River, protect the Sanmenxia Reservoir project, and meet the needs of the Yellow River Qingtongxia water control hub project under construction within the Autonomous Region, have adopted the principle of "emphasizing storage" and "comprehensive management," and vigorously governed the Qingshui River with a spirit full of revolution. After the people's communes were formed last fall, the people of all ethnic groups along both banks of the river, using the method of large-scale corps operations, launched large-scale cooperation between counties and communes, launching a magnificent water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation movement centered on large-scale reservoir construction. Eight reservoir projects were started simultaneously on the main stream and tributaries. Tens of thousands of labor troops fought hard in the severe winter, and this spring and summer they engaged in a heroic struggle with the floods. After hard battles last winter and this year, the main bodies of these eight reservoir projects have been basically completed and have stored more than 100 million cubic meters of water. Some have already carried out summer and winter irrigation. The largest, such as the Zhangjiawan, Shixiakou, Sikouzi, and Xianma River reservoirs, have dam heights of more than 30 or 40 meters, with the highest, such as the Shixiakou Reservoir, having a dam height of 54 meters. The eight reservoirs can irrigate a total of more than 770,000 mu of land, and several of the larger reservoirs have power stations, and some reservoirs have already stocked fish. These reservoirs, after being completed successively this summer, have played a role in retaining floodwaters. In August, when the Yellow River's flow reached 4,000 to 4,600 cubic meters per second, the Shixiakou Reservoir retained a flood peak of 3,100 cubic meters per second from the upper reaches, powerfully ensuring that the Yellow River's flood peak did not increase sharply and that large amounts of sediment did not enter the Yellow River.
    While building reservoirs, the people of all ethnic groups also carried out soil and water conservation work such as banking up fields, building terraced fields, planting trees, and planting pasture in the upper reaches of the reservoirs. According to statistics from Guyuan, Tongxin, and Haiyuan counties, this year a total of more than 286,000 mu of fields were banked up and terraced fields were built, more than 368,000 mu of trees were planted, and more than 1,600 water storage ponds were dug. Together with the various soil and water conservation measures carried out in previous years, the area of soil erosion that can be initially controlled totals more than 3,400 square kilometers. Now, many typical villages that have basically controlled soil erosion have emerged in this river basin, such as the Daliangshan and Pailoushan barren hills in Haiyuan County. After soil and water conservation measures such as banking up fields, building terraced fields, planting trees, and planting pasture, they have basically achieved the requirements of "greening barren hills, terracing slopes, and turning ditches into platforms," becoming the banners of soil and water conservation in the Autonomous Region.
    At present, the people of all ethnic groups living in this river basin are continuing their efforts, taking the approach of emphasizing both water control and mountain management, and continuing to stride forward in the direction of turning the mountainous areas into gardens, the slopes into terraced fields, the gullies into platforms, and the farmland into irrigated areas. On more than 10,000 square kilometers of land, there is a water conservancy and soil and water conservation army of more than 100,000 people, on the one hand building canals and leveling fields in the lower reaches of the reservoirs for winter irrigation, and on the other hand carrying out field soil and water conservation work and planting trees in the upper reaches of the reservoirs.

    拦蓄洪水灌溉农田  防止泥沙流入黄河
    宁夏治理清水河收大效益
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区南部山区清水河流域的广大回、汉族人民，以大兴水利与大搞水土保持相结合的办法，大力治理黄河中游的主要支流清水河。
    现在这条被人们一直称为害河的河流，经过一年多来的大力治理，已收到了巨大效益。今年流域内兴修的八座大、中、小型水库工程，加上其他水土保持措施，就拦蓄洪水一亿八千万方，使大量泥沙没有流入黄河，从而起了保护三门峡水库工程的作用。今冬明春沿河两岸还有四十万亩左右农田将得到灌溉。
    从去年大跃进开始，回汉族人民就根据这条河流域干旱、水土流失灾害严重等自然特点，和为了发展山区生产、根治黄河和保护三门峡水库工程以及自治区境内正在兴修的黄河青铜峡水利枢纽工程等需要，采取“以蓄为主”和“综合治理”的方针，以充满革命的精神大力治理清水河。去年秋天人民公社化以后，沿河两岸各族人民就以大兵团作战的办法，县与县、公社与公社展开大协作，开展了一个气势磅礴的以大兴水库为中心的水利建设和水土保持运动，在干流和支流上，有八座水库工程同时兴起，几万人的劳动大军大战在数九寒天，今年春夏又和洪水展开了英勇搏斗。经过去年冬天和今年一年的苦战，这八座水库的主体工程都已基本完成，已经蓄水一亿多公方，有些已经进行了夏灌和冬灌。最大的如张家湾、石峡口、寺口子、苋麻河等水库，坝高都在三、四十米以上，最高的如石峡口水库坝高五十四米。八座水库共可灌地七十七万多亩，其中几座较大的水库上都设有电站，有的水库已经放养了鱼。这些水库从今年夏季陆续修成以后，就起了拦蓄洪水的作用。8月间，当黄河流量达到四千到四千六百秒公方时，石峡口水库就拦蓄了来自上游的洪峰三千一百秒公方，有力保证了黄河洪峰没有骤增和大量的泥沙没有流入黄河。
    在兴修水库的同时，各族人民还相应的在水库上游进行了培地埂、修梯田、植树造林和种植牧草等水土保持工作。据固原、同心、海原三个县的统计，今年共培地埂、修梯田二十八万六千多亩，造林三十六万八千多亩，挖涝池一千六百多个，连同以往几年来进行的各种水土保持措施，共可初步控制水土冲刷面积三千四百多平方公里。现在这条河流域已经出现了许多基本上控制住水土流失的典型村庄，如海原县的大梁山、牌楼山等荒山秃岭，经过培地埂、修梯田，植树造林，种植牧草等水土保持措施，已经基本上达到了“荒山绿化、坡地梯田化、沟地川台化”的要求，成为自治区水土保持的旗帜。
    目前，居住在这条河流域的各族人民，正在再接再厉，以治水治山并重方针，继续向山区园林化、坡地梯田化、沟壑川台化、耕地水利化的方向阔步前进。在一万多平方公里的土地上，有十多万人的水利和水土保持大军，一面在水库下游兴修渠道、平整田地，进行冬灌，一面在水库上游进行田间水土保持工作和植树造林。
