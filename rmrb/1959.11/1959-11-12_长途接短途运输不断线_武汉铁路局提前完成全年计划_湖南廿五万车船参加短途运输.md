Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 8th: The staff of the Wuhan Railway Bureau completed their annual transportation plan ahead of schedule, offering a gift to the National "Heroes Conference." By November 6th, the bureau had exceeded its annual freight volume plan by 0.1% and its annual passenger volume plan by 22.9%. Transportation costs from January to September were 4.6% lower than planned, and other major planned targets were also exceeded.

The Wuhan Railway Bureau is a new unit established only in October of last year, with weak technical strength and insufficient equipment capacity. The work also has these characteristics: the unloading task is greater than the loading task; a large number of building materials, fuel, and equipment transported from the north must be unloaded in Wuhan, and then empty cars are returned; the task of dismantling and marshalling trains from north to south in Wuhan is very heavy, requiring improvement of train passage capacity and marshalling capacity. The Railway Bureau Party Committee first grasped the key of unloading, organized the entire bureau to carry out the "Safe and Punctual Unloading Movement," built its own indigenous cranes and derricks to improve unloading efficiency. At the same time, it took the initiative to improve cooperation with Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Daye Steel Plant, and Hankou Port Authority, helping them improve their internal loading and unloading, and dispatching work. In addition, it assisted relevant units in rushing to repair some sections with large gradients and curves on the double track between Hankou and Guangshui, and built the new Jiang'an marshalling station in Hankou to improve the railway's passing and marshalling capacity.

The Wuhan Railway Bureau also strengthened enterprise management in a down-to-earth manner, distributed planned targets to teams, and strengthened team accounting. 70% of the bureau's cadres went to the front line, participating in labor while leading production, and mobilized employees to carry out technological innovation around key areas. This also played a major role in completing this year's plan ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 9th: In Hunan Province, more than 700,000 transport troops have been put into the short-distance transportation movement. Driving more than 240,000 vehicles and more than 10,000 ships, some even using shoulder carrying, they are day and night rushing to transport key materials such as grain, coal, pig iron, and timber, to collect and transport goods for long-distance transportation, and to support industrial and agricultural production.

According to surveys, there are more than 16 million tons of materials to be transported in the province in the fourth quarter, including more than 5 million tons of backlog materials. Timely transportation of these materials can meet the needs of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, invigorate the urban and rural economy, and increase the income of people's communes and members. Therefore, after the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party issued a call based on the central government's instructions, it immediately received enthusiastic responses from all over the province. Qianyang Prefecture took the lead, dispatching 250,000 troops in early September, with vehicles and ships traveling together, by both land and water, and has transported more than 340,000 tons of various materials. Hengyang and Chenxian Prefectures also mobilized 130,000 and 40,000 people respectively to participate in short-distance transportation. Guiyang County recently held a short-distance transportation oath-taking rally, proposing to "not let vehicles return empty, and not allow short-distance materials to be backlogged."

The large-scale short-distance transportation movement has directly promoted transportation infrastructure construction, and has set off a mass upsurge of building vehicles and ships and repairing roads everywhere.

    长途接短途运输不断线
    武汉铁路局提前完成全年计划
    湖南廿五万车船参加短途运输
    据新华社武汉8日电　武汉铁路局职工提前完成年度运输计划，向全国“群英会”献礼。到11月6日，这个局已超额0.1％完成今年货物发送量计划，超额22.9％完成今年旅客发送人数计划，1月至9月份的运输成本比计划降低4.6％，其他主要计划指标也都超额完成了。
    武汉铁路局是去年10月才成立的新单位，技术力量薄弱，设备能力不足。工作中还有这样的特点：卸车任务大于装车任务，自北方运来的大批建筑材料、燃料、设备、大部分要在武汉卸车，然后放回空车；南来北往火车在武汉解体、编组的任务很大，要求提高火车通过能力和编组能力。铁路局党委首先抓住卸车这个关键，组织全局职工开展“安全正点卸车运动”，自造土吊车、土扒杆，提高卸车效率。同时，主动搞好同武汉钢铁公司、大冶钢厂和汉口港务局之间的协作，帮助他们改善内部的装卸、调度工作。此外，协助有关单位抢修了汉口广水间某些坡度大、曲线大的区段的复线，新建了汉口的新江岸编组站，来提高铁路的通过能力和编组能力。
    武汉铁路局还扎扎实实地加强了企业管理，把计划指标下达到班组，加强了班组核算。全局70％的干部深入第一线，一面参加劳动，一面领导生产，发动职工围绕关键革新技术。这对提前完成今年计划也起了重大作用。
    据新华社长沙9日电　湖南省目前已有七十多万运输大军投入了大搞短途运输的运动。他们驾着二十四万多辆车子、一万多只船，有的还用肩挑背负，正在日夜抢运粮、煤、生铁、木材等重点物资，为长途运输集运货源，支援工农业生产。
    据调查，全省第四季度待运物资一千六百多万吨，其中有积压物资五百多万吨。及时运出这批物资，既可满足工农业生产大跃进的需要，活跃城乡经济，又可以增加人民公社和社员的收入。因此，当中共湖南省委根据中央指示发出号召之后，立即获得各地热烈响应。黔阳专区一马当先，9月上旬出动二十五万大军，车船齐发，水陆并举，已运出各种物资三十四万多吨。衡阳、郴县两专区也分别动员了十三万和四万多人马投入了短途运输。桂阳县在最近召开了短途运输誓师大会，提出要“来往车辆不放空，短途物资不积压”。
    大搞短途运输运动直接促进了交通基本建设，使各地掀起了群众性的大造车船、大修道路的群众性的热潮。
