Xinhua News Agency, Budapest Dispatch: (By Our Correspondent) In order to strive for the early arrival of the day of complete socialist victory in Hungary, the broad masses of rural areas in Hungary are currently intensifying the socialist transformation of agriculture, preparing to rely on the large-scale operation of socialist agriculture during the Second Five-Year Plan period (1961-1965) to vigorously increase agricultural output.

The Hungarian agricultural cooperativization movement has achieved tremendous development in the past three years, especially since this spring, and the face of the countryside has undergone great changes. At present, the cultivated land area of agricultural production cooperatives and state farms accounts for more than half of the total cultivated land area in the country, and 40% of the country's villages and towns have achieved cooperativization. Agricultural production cooperatives have played a huge role in agricultural development. This year, the average yield of bread grains in old cooperatives is 25% higher than that of individual farmers, and the average yield of new cooperatives is also 10%-15% higher than that of individual farmers.

According to the Party's instructions, the general task in agriculture during Hungary's Second Five-Year Plan period is to ensure the supply of the country's growing needs and the agricultural raw materials necessary for industry, and to expand exports. To this end, agricultural production will increase by 30% to 32% compared to the average output of 1954-1958 during the Second Five-Year Plan period. At the same time, animal husbandry will develop at a faster rate. By 1965, meat livestock will increase by 30% to 33% compared to 1954-1958, and milk will increase by 50% to 55%.

On the basis of realizing agricultural cooperativization in the Hungarian countryside in a few years, large amounts of investment will be made to develop agricultural production. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the state's investment in developing agriculture and long-term loans to agricultural production cooperatives will reach 37 to 39 billion forints, accounting for 18.7% of the total investment. This will be an 88% increase over the investment amount of 1956-1960.

Modernized large-scale operation will fundamentally change the methods of crop production. The latest scientific achievements will be widely adopted to increase yield per unit area. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, agricultural mechanization will develop rapidly. By 1965, the number of tractors will increase by nearly one and a half times compared to 1958, reaching 63,000 units. By then, the main field labor will be mechanized.

In order to achieve the agricultural production tasks during the Second Five-Year Plan period, the Hungarian Party and government will also take measures to expand irrigation area, strengthen soil improvement, increase the application of chemical fertilizers, and adopt modern plant protection technologies. By 1965, the amount of fertilizer used per hectare of cultivated land nationwide will reach 140-150 kilograms, an increase of two times compared to 1958. Six hundred thousand hectares of barren land will be improved, which is equivalent to twice the area of soil improvement during the period of 1954-1958. The irrigated area will be increased to two and a half times the current level. By 1965, chemical methods will be used to weed 1.5 million hectares of cultivated land.

In order to meet the food needs of residents and increase the export of agricultural products, commodity production will be increased. By 1965, commodity procurement will increase by 45%-50% compared to 1958.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest Dispatch: Hungarian Minister of Food Kovács Imre pointed out in an article published in "People's Free Press" on the 22nd that this year, along with the large-scale development of the agricultural production cooperativization movement, Hungary's agricultural production has also increased significantly. Due to the hard work of the farmers and favorable climate, this year the average yield per unit area of wheat increased by 22.5% compared to the average yield of 1956-1958, corn increased by 22.1%, and sugar beets increased by 18.2%. In October of this year, the number of pigs increased by 15.9% compared to 1957, and 6.7% more than in 1958.

The article pointed out that socialist large enterprises have demonstrated their productive superiority. The average yield per unit area of various crops in cooperatives is higher than that of individual farmers. From the end of March to October 15 this year, the number of livestock per 100 hectares of cultivated land in cooperatives increased by an average of 30.4%.

It is estimated that the procurement of major agricultural products this year will increase by 10%-12% compared to the average quantity of the period of 1954-1956. The procurement volume of livestock and livestock products has also increased significantly. This year, 40% more fat pigs, 54% more poultry, 28% more eggs, and 41% more milk were procured than in 1957.

In addition, Hungary will continue to increase the yield per unit area of grains next year to ensure food self-sufficiency without relying on imports. In the future, it will also vigorously develop the pig industry and continue to increase the production of poultry and eggs.

    匈牙利加速农业社会主义改造
    第二个五年计划为发展农业订出美好远景计划
    合作化运动获得巨大进展　农业生产显著提高
    新华社布达佩斯电　本社记者报道：为了争取社会主义在匈牙利完全胜利的日子早日到来，匈牙利广大农村目前正在加紧农业的社会主义改造，准备在第二个五年计划期间（1961—1965年），依靠社会主义农业的大规模经营，大力提高农业产量。
    匈牙利农业合作化运动最近三年来，特别是今年春季以来，获得了巨大的发展，农村面貌起了很大变化。目前，农业生产合作社和国营农场的耕地面积已占全国耕地总面积的一半以上，全国40％的村镇实现了合作化。农业生产合作社在农业发展中发挥了巨大的威力。今年面包谷物的平均产量，老社比个体农民高25％，新社也比个体农民高10％—15％。
    根据党的指示，匈牙利第二个五年计划期间在农业方面总的任务是保证供应国内日益增长的需要和工业所必需的农业原料和扩大出口。为此，在第二个五年计划期间，农业生产将比1954—1958年的平均产量提高30％到32％。同时，畜牧业将以更快的速度发展。到1965年，肉用牲畜要比1954—1958年增长30％—33％，牛奶增长50％—55％。
    匈牙利农村将在几年内实现农业合作化的基础上，大量投资，发展农业生产。国家在第二个五年计划期间，用于发展农业和给予农业生产合作社的长期贷款将达三百七十—三百九十亿福林，占总投资的18.7％。这将比1956—1960年的投资额增长88％。
    近代化大规模的经营将使农作物生产方法发生根本性的变革。将广泛采用科学的最新成就来提高单位面积产量。在第二个五年计划期间，农业机械化将迅速发展。到1965年，拖拉机的数量将比1958年增长近一倍半，达六万三千台。到那时，主要的田间劳动都将机械化。
    为了实现第二个五年计划期间的农业生产任务，匈牙利党和政府还将采取措施，扩大灌溉面积，加强土壤改良，增施化学肥料，采用近代化的植物保护技术。到1965年，全国每霍尔特耕地的化肥使用量将达到一百四十—一百五十公斤，比1958年增加二倍。将改良六十万霍尔特瘠地，这相当于1954—1958年期间土壤改良面积的两倍。灌溉面积要增加到现在的两倍半。到1965年，将有一百五十万霍尔特耕地利用化学方法除草。
    为了满足居民的食品需要和增加农产品的出口，将提高商品生产。到1965年，商品收购将比1958年增长45％—50％。
    新华社布达佩斯电　匈牙利粮食部长科瓦奇·伊姆雷22日在“人民自由报”上发表文章指出，今年在农业生产合作化运动大规模发展的同时，匈牙利农业生产也有了显著的提高。由于农民辛勤的劳动和气候良好，今年小麦单位面积平均产量比1956—1958年的平均产量提高了22.5％，玉米提高22.1％，糖萝卜提高18.2％。今年10月份，猪的头数比1957年增加15.9％，比1958年多6.7％。
    文章指出，社会主义大企业显示了它的生产的优越性。合作社各种农作物单位面积的平均收成都比个体农民高。从今年3月末到10月15日，合作社平均一百霍尔特耕地面积的牲口数增长30.4％。
    今年主要农产品的收购预计会比1954—1956年时期的平均数量提高10％—12％。牲畜和畜产品的收购量也大大增加。今年比1957年多收购肥猪40％，家禽54％，鸡蛋28％，牛奶41％。
    此外，匈牙利明年还要继续提高谷物的单位面积产量，保证粮食自给自足不依靠进口。今后还要大力发展养猪业，并继续增加家禽和鸡蛋的产量。
