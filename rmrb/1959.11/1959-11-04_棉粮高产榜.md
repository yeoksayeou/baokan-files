    Cotton expert Wu Daosheng sets a new record of over 700 catties of ginned cotton per mu
    Yuxi Prefecture's 900,000 mu of rice achieves over 700 catties per mu
    Shangluo Prefecture sees 47 rice production teams achieving over 1,000 catties
    Qijia Commune becomes the first grain "thousand-catty commune" in the mountainous areas of Shandong

    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 3rd: Wu Daosheng, a national model for cotton yield and a member of the Xingfu (Happiness) Brigade of the Xingfu Commune in Huarong County, Hunan Province, has created an even greater record of high cotton yield this year. He and eleven female commune members jointly cultivated 13.5 mu of high-yield cotton fields, having already harvested more than 70% of the crop, averaging 518 catties of ginned cotton per mu. Based on the remaining cotton bolls on the plants, it is estimated that the yield will exceed 700 catties of ginned cotton per mu.

    The yield of the already harvested portion of this high-yield cotton field has been inspected, weighed, and verified on-site by a joint inspection team organized by the Provincial Department of Agriculture, the Provincial Planning Commission, the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hunan Agricultural College, and relevant departments of the prefecture and county. The cotton has long and fine fibers, a snow-white color, a high ginning outturn, and excellent quality.

    Wu Daosheng was named a model of high cotton yield in the province and the country in 1952 and 1956, respectively, and the cotton fields he cultivated have consistently maintained the highest cotton yield per mu in the province. This year, he led eleven young female commune members in fully utilizing and developing his years of experience in increasing production, planting the "Happiness No. 1" cotton seeds that he had painstakingly cultivated over the years in the high-yield fields. Before sowing, he used a new treatment method for the cotton seeds: for every 100 catties of cotton seeds, he mixed one catty of Xilaisheng (a disinfectant) and one catty of 25% DDT, then mixed it with 100 catties of mud from ditches to coat the cotton seeds with a layer of thin mud, dried them in the sun, and then sowed them into the soil. This treatment can prevent pests and diseases and ensure strong seedlings. In mid-June, after a severe drought occurred, Wu Daosheng and the women climbed slopes and turned dikes to irrigate the cotton fields ten times, each time watering over 600 dan (a unit of weight) per mu, finally preserving the early bolls and ensuring that the late bolls were full, creating a high yield.

    This spring, when Wu Daosheng ambitiously wanted to create large-scale high-yield cotton fields, some people with right-leaning conservative ideas opposed him, saying that the high cost would not be recovered. However, with the support of the commune Party committee, Wu Daosheng remained determined and unshaken. After the harvest, he calculated the accounts: the total income from 13.5 mu of cotton fields could reach more than 9,863 yuan. After deducting costs, the net surplus was more than 7,700 yuan, averaging more than six yuan per labor day, which is much higher than the value created by an average labor day. This vivid fact deeply educated some people with right-leaning conservative ideas.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, November 3rd: Yunnan Province's Yuxi Prefecture has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of spring grain crops. Out of 1,015,590 mu of medium and late rice, 981,557 mu have been harvested, with an average yield of 762 catties of dried grain per mu, an increase of nearly 20% compared to 1958. In addition, the average rice yield per mu in eight people's communes reached 1,000 catties; and more than 11,000 mu of rice had yields of over 2,000 catties per mu.

    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, November 3rd: Shaanxi Province's Shangluo Prefecture has achieved a bumper rice harvest. Over 95,000 mu of rice yielded an average of 647 catties per mu.

    According to incomplete statistics, 47 rice "thousand-catty production teams" have emerged throughout the prefecture. The Xingping Production Team of the Huotai Commune in Zhen'an County achieved an average yield of 1,017.6 catties per mu on 427 mu of rice. The Hongwan Production Team of the Majie Commune in Shang County achieved an average yield of 1,142 catties per mu on 70 mu of rice. One mu of rice in the Beishi Production Team of the Sanyao Commune in Luonan County yielded 2,312 catties per mu.

    During the rice growing season this year, the area also suffered a severe drought unprecedented in more than 20 years, with rivers drying up and rice fields parched. Under the leadership of the Party, people's communes in various places criticized ideas such as the "reduction in production is a foregone conclusion" and launched a high tide of drought resistance and seedling protection. More than 181,500 people were involved in the fight against drought, organizing specialized teams to find water, dig springs, dig ponds, carry water, and irrigate the land, overcoming the drought.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, November 3rd: The Qijia People's Commune in Penglai County, Shandong Province, has changed the natural landscape of poor and barren hills, raising the first high-yield red flag in the mountainous areas of Shandong Province with a grain yield of more than one thousand catties per mu. The average yield of 26,391 mu of grain crops in the entire commune was 1,150 catties per mu, an increase of 76.9% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958.

    Most of the land in the Qijia People's Commune is distributed on poor and barren hills. In the past, there were droughts in the spring and autumn, and floods in the summer, causing disasters and very low grain yields. After communization, more than 10,000 people were organized into a large army to control mountains and water. After more than 100 days of hard work, a total of 151 reservoirs and ponds were built, and 59 canals were dug, expanding the irrigated area from 4,500 mu to more than 28,500 mu, accounting for more than 70% of the cultivated land. 29,700 mu of thin land in the mountain gullies were universally deep-plowed to a depth of more than one chi (foot). After leveling the ground and building terraces, the land was transformed into ridged fields, overcoming the drought that lasted for more than a month this year, turning a year of severe drought into a year of bumper harvest.

    棉粮高产榜
    吴道生创造亩产皮棉七百多斤新纪录
    玉溪专区九十万亩水稻亩产七百多斤
    商雒专区出现了四十七个水稻千斤队
    七甲公社跃为山东山区第一个粮食千斤社
    新华社长沙3日电　全国棉花丰产模范、湖南华容县幸福公社幸福大队社员吴道生，今年创造了更大的棉花高额丰产纪录。他和十一名女社员共同种植的十三点五亩棉花丰产田，已经收摘七成以上，平均每亩收皮棉五百一十八斤，根据棉株上还有的棉桃计算，预计每亩可收皮棉七百多斤。
    这块棉花丰产田已收部分的产量，已经省农业厅、省计划委员会、省农业科学研究所、湖南农学院和专区、县各有关部门共同组织的联合验收组，临田检查，过秤验收核实；棉花的纤维细长，色泽雪白，衣分率高，质量很好。
    吴道生在1952年和1956年分别被评为全省、全国棉花丰产模范，他种的棉田，一直保持全省棉花亩产最高纪录。今年，他带领着十一个年青女社员，充分运用和发展了他历年的增产经验，在丰产田上种上了自己几年来苦心培育的“幸福一号”棉种。下种前，对棉种运用了新的处理方法：每一百斤棉种以西力生一斤和25％的滴滴涕一斤拌种，然后再用一百斤阴沟泥拌搅使棉籽上糊上一层稀泥，晒干后再播种入土，经过这样的处理，能防止病虫害，而且出苗粗壮。6月中旬，发生严重旱象后，吴道生和妇女们爬坡翻堤，给棉田浇过十次水，每次每亩浇水六百多担，终于保住了伏桃，使秋桃满枝，创造了高额丰产。
    今年春季，当吴道生雄心勃勃要搞大面积棉花丰产田时，曾有一些有右倾保守思想的人表示反对，说成本花得高了怕收不回来。但吴道生在公社党委支持下，斗志坚强，毫不动摇。丰收以后，他算了一笔账：十三点五亩棉田总收入可达九千八百六十三元多，除去成本，净余七千七百多元，平均每个劳动日合六元多，比一般劳动日创造的价值高很多。这一生动事实，深刻地教育了一些有右倾保守思想的人。
    据新华社昆明3日电　云南省玉溪专区大春粮食作物大面积丰收。全区一百零一万五千五百九十亩中、晚稻已收打九十八万一千五百五十七亩，平均亩产干谷七百六十二斤，比1958年增产将近两成。另外，有八个人民公社水稻平均亩产达到一千斤；有一万一千多亩水稻亩产达到二千斤以上。
    据新华社西安3日电　陕西省商雒专区水稻丰收。九万五千多亩水稻，平均亩产六百四十七斤。
    据不完全的统计，全专区还出现了四十七个水稻千斤生产队。镇安县霍台公社杏坪生产队四百二十七亩水稻，平均亩产一千零一十七斤六两。商县麻街公社红湾生产队七十亩水稻平均亩产一千一百四十二斤。雒南县三要公社北师生产队的一亩水稻，亩产二千三百一十二斤。
    今年水稻生长期间，还遭到二十多年来从未有的严重干旱，河水断流，稻田干涸。各地人民公社在党的领导下，批判了减产“定局论”等思想，掀起了抗旱保苗高潮。投入抗旱斗争的有十八万一千五百多人，组织了找水、掏泉、挖潭、担水、浇地专业队，战胜了干旱。
    据新华社济南3日电　山东蓬莱县七甲人民公社改变了穷山秃岭的自然面貌，举起了山东省山丘地区第一面粮食亩产千斤以上的高产红旗。全社二万六千三百九十一亩粮食作物，平均亩产一千一百五十斤，比大跃进的1958年增产76.9％。
    七甲人民公社大部土地分布在穷山秃岭之上，过去春秋干旱，夏季山洪暴发，暴雨成灾，粮食产量很低。公社化后，组织了一万多名治山治水大军，经过一百多天的苦干，共修起水库塘坝一百五十一座，开山挖渠五十九条，使水浇地面积由原来四千五百亩扩大到二万八千五百多亩，占耕地面积70％以上。二万九千七百亩山沟薄地普遍深翻一尺以上，经过平整地面，筑起梯田，实现畦田化，战胜了今年持续一个多月的干旱，使大旱年变成了大丰收年。
