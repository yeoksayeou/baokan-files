Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 15th: As the Political Committee of the current United Nations General Assembly is about to discuss the Korean question, "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial today stating that North Korea has repeatedly expressed its unwavering position on the United Nations' discussion of the Korean question, which is: The Korean question is a matter for the Korean people themselves, and no external interference can be tolerated.

The editorial said that the United Nations has never had any right or basis to discuss the Korean question, which became a post-war settlement issue after World War II. The editorial pointed out that because the American aggressor group wanted to turn Korea into its colony and military base, the Korean question was brought to the United Nations, and this issue has become a routine matter for the General Assembly to discuss every year. More than ten years of discussion has not only failed to help solve the problem, but has complicated it and damaged the prestige of the United Nations. The American aggressor group even usurped the United Nations flag and carried out an unprecedentedly barbaric armed intervention in Korea.

The editorial emphasized that if the United Nations is to discuss the Korean question, it should first allow the true representatives of the Korean people—the representatives of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea—to participate and listen to their legitimate demands.

The editorial said, "North Korea's consistent and unwavering position is: after the withdrawal of the U.S. troops and all other foreign troops from South Korea, the Korean people themselves should peacefully reunify the motherland on a democratic basis through their own all-Korean elections. This is the way to solve the Korean question."

### 朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表社论  联合国无权讨论朝鲜问题

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表社论
    联合国无权讨论朝鲜问题
    新华社平壤15日电　在本届联合国大会政治委员会即将讨论朝鲜问题的时候，“劳动新闻”今天发表社论说，朝鲜对联合国讨论朝鲜问题屡次表明了不可动摇的立场，这就是：朝鲜问题是朝鲜人民自己的事情，决不能容许任何外来的干涉。
    社论说，联合国从一开始就没有任何权利和根据讨论在第二次大战结束后成为战后处理问题的朝鲜问题。社论指出，由于美国侵略集团要使朝鲜成为它的殖民地和军事基地，把朝鲜问题提到联合国，这个问题就成了联大每年都要讨论的例行事务。讨论了十年以上，不仅无助于问题的解决，反而使问题复杂化，并损害了联合国的威信。美国侵略集团甚至盗用了联合国旗帜，在朝鲜进行了史无前例野蛮的武装干涉。
    社论强调说，联合国既然要讨论朝鲜问题，那就应该首先让朝鲜人民的真正的代表——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表参加，并倾听他们的正当呼声。
    社论说，“朝鲜一贯的不可动摇的立场是：在美军等一切外国军队撤出南朝鲜以后，由朝鲜人民自己通过自己的全朝鲜的普选，在民主基础上和平统一祖国，这才是解决朝鲜问题的道路。”
