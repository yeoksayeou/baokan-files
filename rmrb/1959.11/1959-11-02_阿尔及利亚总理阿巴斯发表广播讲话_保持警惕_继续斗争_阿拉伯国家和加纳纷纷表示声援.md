Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 31st: On the fifth anniversary of Algeria's war for independence, Algerian Republic Provisional Government Prime Minister Abbas said that the Algerian people and the National Liberation Army will continue to be vigilant until the Algerian people obtain political power and decide their own destiny according to their own wishes.

In a radio address on "Voice of the Algerian Republic" tonight, Abbas said that Algeria has become a front line full of heroic acts and sacrifices over the past five years. He said that those in power in France are forcing the Algerian people to continue the struggle because they have never dared to recognize the rights of the Algerian people, who since 1954 have preferred to fight rather than surrender.

The Prime Minister further said, "The Algerian people have learned from five years of war that the road to freedom is full of obstacles and difficulties, but because of our strong unity, we will overcome all obstacles and difficulties and achieve victory."

Algerian Provisional Government Foreign Minister Mohammed Amin Debaghine, currently in Cairo, said in a statement tonight that Algeria's struggle has become one of the factors driving other nations' struggles against imperialism for freedom, independence, and sovereignty.

He said that no one can ignore the role of Algeria's struggle in the achievements of the Tunisian and Moroccan people in their fight for independence. He also pointed out the influence of the Algerian people's struggle on the African national independence movement.

Compiled report by this newspaper, Xinhua News Agency: On the fifth anniversary of Algeria's war for independence, Arab countries and the government of Ghana expressed their support for the just struggle of the Algerian people.

Arab League Secretary-General Hassouna issued a statement requesting the French government to agree to the demands of the Algerians so that the Algerian people can decide their own destiny completely freely. He said that otherwise, the Algerian people will continue to struggle with the support of world opinion until France recognizes their rights to freedom and independence.

Referring to the proposals made by the French government on the Algerian issue, Hassouna said that France's insistence on negotiations after the ceasefire makes one doubt the value of France's proposals.

Arab diplomats stationed in Cairo issued a statement on October 31, the fifth anniversary of the Algerian revolution, supporting the Algerian people's struggle against French imperialism. Hassan Ibrahim, the representative of the King of Yemen in Cairo, reiterated that Yemen fully supports the Algerian people. Libyan Ambassador to the United Arab Republic, Khalil Karalar, said that France violated the principles of the United Nations Charter in its war of aggression against the Algerian people. Moroccan Chargé d'Affaires to the United Arab Republic, Abdul Hadi Shalabi, said that the silence of major Western countries on the cause of the struggling Algerian people is a disregard for the rights of small and weak countries and a shameful attitude. The statement from the Oman Imamate Office in Cairo stated that what France is doing in Algeria is the same as what Britain is doing in Oman. The Arab people are determined to turn their land into a graveyard for these imperialists. The Lebanese Ambassador and the Saudi Arabian Chargé d'Affaires to the United Arab Republic also expressed their support for the Algerian struggle.

Ghana held "Algeria Day" on November 1, the fifth anniversary of the Algerian people's struggle, in accordance with the decision of the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Independent African States in August this year, to support the Algerian people's struggle for independence. The Ghanaian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement paying tribute to the Algerian fighters who fought to defend their homeland. The statement called on "all peace-loving people and governments to exert their influence to stop the bloodshed in Algeria."

    阿尔及利亚总理阿巴斯发表广播讲话
    保持警惕　继续斗争
    阿拉伯国家和加纳纷纷表示声援
    新华社开罗31日电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯在阿尔及利亚争取独立战争五周年之际说，阿尔及利亚人民和民族解放军将继续保持警惕，直到阿尔及利亚人民取得政权和按照自己的愿望来决定自己的命运之日。
    阿巴斯今晚在“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台发表的广播讲话中说，过去五年中，阿尔及利亚已经成为充满英雄行为和牺牲的前线。他说，在法国执政的人迫使阿尔及利亚人民继续斗争，因为他们从来不敢承认阿尔及利亚人民的权利，阿尔及利亚人民从1954年起就宁愿战斗而不愿屈服。
    这位总理进一步说，“阿尔及利亚人民从五年战争中获得了这样的教训：争取自由的道路是充满着障碍和困难的，但是由于我们的坚强团结，我们将克服一切障碍和困难，取得胜利。”
    目前在开罗的阿尔及利亚临时政府外交部长穆罕默德·阿明·德巴金在今晚发表的谈话中说，阿尔及利亚的斗争已经成为因素之一，推动着其它民族向帝国主义争取自由、独立和主权的斗争。
    他说，谁也不能忽视阿尔及利亚的斗争对突尼斯和摩洛哥人民争取独立的成果所起的作用。他并且指出阿尔及利亚人民的斗争对于非洲民族独立运动的影响。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在阿尔及利亚争取独立战争五周年之际，阿拉伯各国和加纳政府表示支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争。
    阿拉伯联盟秘书长哈苏纳发表声明，要求法国政府同意阿尔及利亚人的要求，使阿尔及利亚人民能完全自由地决定自己的命运。他说，否则，阿尔及利亚人民将在世界舆论的支持下继续斗争，直到法国承认他们的自由和独立权利为止。
    谈到法国政府就阿尔及利亚问题提出的建议时，哈苏纳说，法国坚持在停火之后进行谈判，这就使人怀疑法国的建议的价值。
    阿拉伯国家驻开罗的外交官员31日在阿尔及利亚革命五周年之际发表声明，支持阿尔及利亚人民反对法帝国主义的斗争。也门国王驻开罗代表哈桑·易卜拉欣重申，也门全力声援阿尔及利亚人民。利比亚驻阿联大使哈利勒·卡拉勒说，法国在对阿尔及利亚人民进行的侵略战争中违背了联合国宪章的原则。摩洛哥驻阿联代办阿卜杜勒·哈迪·沙赖比说，西方主要国家对斗争中的阿尔及利亚人民的事业保持沉默，是对弱小国家权利的忽视，是一种可耻的态度。阿曼教长驻开罗办事处声明说，法国在阿尔及利亚的所做所为同英国在阿曼正在干的勾当是一样的。阿拉伯人民决心把他们的土地变成埋葬这些帝国主义者的坟墓。黎巴嫩大使和沙特阿拉伯驻阿联代办也表示支持阿尔及利亚的斗争。
    加纳在11月1日阿尔及利亚人民斗争五周年之际，根据今年8月非洲独立国家外长会议的决定，举行“阿尔及利亚日”，支持阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争。加纳外交部发表声明，向为保卫祖国而战的阿尔及利亚战士致敬。声明要求“所有热爱和平的人民和政府施加自己的影响，以制止在阿尔及利亚的流血战争”。
