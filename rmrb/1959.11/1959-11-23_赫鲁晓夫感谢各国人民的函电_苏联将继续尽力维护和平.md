    赫鲁晓夫感谢各国人民的函电
    苏联将继续尽力维护和平
    新华社莫斯科21日电　据塔斯社莫斯科20日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在向报界发表的信件中表示感谢苏联人和国外人士因他不久前访问美国而给苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会发来的许多信件和电报。
    信中说，美国公民——工人、农民、知识界和实业界人士寄来了许多友好的信件。这些信件对苏联部长会议主席和美国总统之间互相访问表示欢迎，并希望苏联和美国之间的关系不断改善，成为友好的关系，希望苏联政府继续努力来制止“冷战”和军备竞赛。
    赫鲁晓夫写道，苏联政府一贯执行、今后将继续执行列宁的和平外交政策。它遵循着一国不干涉另一国内政的原则，力求在互惠的基础上争取同一切国家合作和友好，并尽一切必要的努力来巩固世界和平。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，苏联政府的这种意图同各国人民在信件中所表达的崇高愿望是完全一致的。目前已经形成了这样一种气氛，在这种气氛下，能够而且必须制止“冷战”的维护者重新把事情引向国际局势尖锐化。
    信中说，至于苏联政府和苏联人民，那么，他们将尽一切必要的努力，使国与国之间的关系得到改善，使人类永远摆脱新战争的威胁，使和平共处的原则获得胜利。
