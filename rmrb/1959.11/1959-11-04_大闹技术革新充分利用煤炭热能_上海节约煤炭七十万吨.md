According to the Jiefang Daily, with the rapid development of industrial production, the broad masses of workers in Shanghai are promoting the spirit of diligence and thrift, vigorously carrying out technical innovation, comprehensively implementing the principle of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and fully utilizing coal and heat energy. In October, they saved nearly 160,000 tons of coal. To date, 710,000 tons of coal have been saved in the first ten months of this year (which can be used to refine 2 million tons of open-hearth steel, generate more than 1 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, or supply all factories in the city's textile industry for eight months), completing 71% of this year's target of saving 1 million tons of coal.

In the first half of this year, the city saved 250,000 tons of coal. After entering the third quarter, all fronts mobilized the masses, conscientiously implemented the policy of comprehensively leaping forward with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. While focusing on production, they tightly grasped the work of saving coal, saving 300,000 tons of coal in three months. In the dyeing and printing industry, which consumes a large amount of coal, coal consumption has decreased month by month since July. Originally, the coal consumption for producing 1,000 meters of cloth was 235.79 kilograms. It dropped to 192 kilograms in July, 172.45 kilograms in August, and 162.84 kilograms in September. The coal saving rate of most factories reached about 30%, and some factories even reached as high as 50%.

Vigorously carrying out innovation plays a significant role in saving coal. The Dafeng Printing and Dyeing Factory, which had previously performed poorly in completing coal saving targets, broke superstitions and promoted coal saving from the boiler room to the workshop. They vigorously carried out technological innovation, greatly reducing steam consumption, which not only increased the proportion of coal saving from 20% to 40% at once, but also increased the daily output of cloth from 4,000 bolts to 5,500 bolts. The wrought iron industry, which has always been considered difficult to develop coal saving, has also achieved results. The staff of the Jianli Wrought Iron Factory boldly broke the superstition that "wrought iron must use bituminous coal," improved the method of heating iron in a coal shed to heating in a reverberatory furnace, and improved operating techniques. They not only achieved the complete replacement of bituminous coal with anthracite coal, but also achieved three goals with one arrow: coal consumption was reduced from the original 1,450 kilograms per ton of forgings to 408 kilograms, the output of forgings increased by an average of five times compared to the second quarter, and the quality fully met the requirements, setting an example for the entire industry in saving coal and increasing production.

In order to support industrial production, canteens in municipal offices, schools, hospitals, and troops stationed in Shanghai have also actively carried out coal saving work. According to key inspections and estimations, the average daily coal consumption for cooking in canteens was originally about fourteen liang per person, but it has now been reduced to about eight to ten liang.

In order to ensure the leap forward in production, all coal-consuming, loading, unloading, transporting, and storing units in Shanghai, as well as the general public, are now seizing the time in November and December to make greater achievements in coal saving, striving to greatly overfulfill this year's city-wide coal saving target of 1 million tons.

The Shanghai Jiefang Daily published an editorial on this, urging all employees in the city to go all out and greatly over fulfill the task of saving one million tons of coal. The editorial said that with the rapid growth of industrial production, the demand for coal in all aspects is also increasing. Although the amount of coal allocated to the city by the state is also increasing day by day, the increase is still not enough to meet the objective needs. This requires the Shanghai working class to further carry out the work of saving and substituting coal, and to produce more and better products with less coal.

The editorial said that increasing production requires drive, and saving also requires drive. Under the current circumstances of low coal supply and high demand, only by making two catties of coal play the role of three catties of coal can we increase the production of steel, machinery, electrical machinery, chemicals, and textile products. Only when every employee recognizes the importance of saving coal can they better overcome the erroneous ideas such as "saving has reached its peak and there is no potential to be tapped," consciously participate in the movement to save coal, and do everything possible to reduce coal consumption, develop substitutions, and reduce and eliminate coal loss.

The editorial said that while conducting ideological mobilization among cadres and the masses, it is also necessary to quickly strengthen specific leadership over coal saving work. All departments and enterprises must fully mobilize the masses to carefully check waste, find ways to save, vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, promote various effective advanced experiences in saving coal, and effectively strengthen management, establish and improve relevant systems. By plugging loopholes in waste, we will further promote coal consumption quotas, so that the movement to save coal can be consolidated, sustained, and deepened to achieve greater achievements.

    大闹技术革新充分利用煤炭热能
    上海节约煤炭七十万吨
    据解放日报消息　随着工业生产的飞跃发展，上海市广大职工发扬勤俭节约精神，大闹技术革新，全面贯彻多快好省方针，充分利用煤炭和热能，10月份节约煤炭近十六万吨。至此，今年十个月已节约煤炭七十一万吨（可以炼平炉钢二百万吨，或发电十亿多度，或供本市纺织工业所有工厂使用八个月），完成了今年节煤一百万吨指标的71％。
    今年上半年全市节约煤炭二十五万吨，跨入三季度后，条条战线发动群众，认真贯彻了多快好省全面跃进的方针，在大抓生产的同时，紧紧抓住节约用煤的工作，三个月节约煤炭三十万吨。用煤数量很大的印染行业，7月份以来煤耗月月下降，原来生产一千米布的煤耗要二百三十五点七九公斤，7月份降为一百九十二公斤，8月份又降为一百七十二点四五公斤，9月份降低到一百六十二点八四公斤。绝大部分工厂的节煤幅度达到30％左右，部分厂甚至高达50％。
    大搞革新对于节约煤炭起着很大的作用。原来节煤指标完成较差的达丰印染厂，破除迷信，把节煤工作从炉子间推向车间，大搞工艺革新，大大减少了蒸汽消耗，不但使节约用煤的比例由20％一下子提高到40％，而且使布的日产量从四千匹跃增到五千五百匹。向来认为节煤很难开展的锻铁行业，也创造了成绩。建立锻铁厂职工大胆破除“锻铁非用烟煤不可”的迷信，把煤棚煨铁的方法改进为反射炉加热，并改进操作技术，不但做到了全部改用白煤，而且一箭三雕：煤耗由原来每吨锻件的一千四百五十公斤降低到四百零八公斤，锻件产量平均比二季度增加五倍，质量完全合乎要求，为全行业节煤增产树立了榜样。
    全市机关、学校、医院和驻沪部队的食堂，为了支援工业生产，也积极开展节煤工作，据重点检查推算，食堂炊事用煤原来每人每日耗煤平均为十四两左右，目前已减少到八到十两左右。
    为了保证生产跃进，现在上海市所有用煤和装卸运输保管等单位以及广大市民，正抓紧11、12两个月时间，做出更大的节煤成绩，争取大大超额完成今年全市节煤一百万吨的指标。
    上海解放日报为此发表社论，要求全市职工，鼓足干劲，大大超额完成百万吨节煤任务。社论说，随着工业生产的迅猛增长，各方面对煤炭的需要也越来越大了。虽然国家调拨给本市的煤炭数量也在日益增多，但是，增加的数量仍不能满足客观需要。这就要求上海工人阶级进一步开展煤炭的节约代用工作，用更少的煤炭生产出更多更好的产品。
    社论说，增产要有干劲，节约也要有干劲，在目前供煤少，需要大的情况下，只有使两斤煤发挥三斤煤的作用，才能增产钢铁、机械、电机、化工和轻纺产品。只有当每一个职工都认识到节约用煤的重要意义，才能更好地克服那些“节约已经到顶了，没有潜力可挖了”等的错误思想，人人自觉地参加到节约用煤的运动中来，千方百计降低煤耗，开展代用，减少和消灭煤炭的损耗。
    社论说，在向干部和群众进行思想发动的同时，还要迅速加强对节约用煤工作的具体领导。各部门和各企业要充分发动群众认真检查浪费，寻找节约的窍门，大闹技术革新和技术革命，推广行之有效的各种节约用煤的先进经验，并切实加强管理，建立与健全有关制度，通过堵塞浪费漏洞，进一步推行耗煤定额，使节约用煤的运动巩固、持久和深入地开展下去，取得更大成就。
