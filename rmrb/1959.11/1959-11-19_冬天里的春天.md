Spring in Winter
By our reporters Hui Xian, Kong Cheng, Shi Kai

Winter has arrived. As people are intensely battling to complete the major targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, behind the production front, there are many "housekeepers" who undertake work that is inextricably linked to the Great Leap Forward. Their noble labor also radiates intense light and heat.

Hot Food, Fragrant Dishes, Warm Work Sheds

At the Beijing Thermal Power Station construction site. A level five gale is blowing outside, but the spacious and bright construction site canteen is as warm as spring. The cooks made braised noodles for the construction workers, and also made dozens of dishes such as pork stewed with radish, braised gluten, and stir-fried spinach with vermicelli for those who like rice and steamed buns. They served the dishes and placed them in specially made insulated stoves. Next to them was a large pot of free hot and sour soup, steaming hot. Outside the canteen, three cars and handcarts were lined up, used to deliver food to the workers. Yan Huirong, the head of the cooking班, stood on the car like a commander, instructing the cooks to hand him a thick quilt to cover the food tightly. At lunchtime, the construction workers rushed in, each selecting a portion of their favorite food, eating and chatting around the clean tables. The entire dining hall was filled with joy. The cement and earthwork workers, who were far from the canteen, also received the same food as in the canteen, delivered by the cooks.

The thousands of workers on this construction site all live in buildings with heating, and the canteens and work sheds are also equipped with stoves. In order to ensure that the construction workers eat well in winter, the cooks have held several meetings. They have ordered a "winter menu" for the workers. The workers can eat more than thirty kinds of dishes and sixteen kinds of rice each week. The meals are different every day, and they often have dumplings.

The second phase of the project is underway at this construction site. The construction workers are ensuring that the newly installed 100,000-kilowatt generator will be operating at full capacity by November 20th to support the industrial production of the capital. And the battle cry of the cooks is:

　　Rise early and work late, busy by the fire,
　　Make the food hot and fragrant,
　　Workers eat their fill and are strong,
　　Spirits are high, and energy is strong.

Enthusiastic Housekeepers

"Sister Liu, what should I do? The sleeves of these two small cotton-padded jackets are too short, and there's no way to make them. Can you think of a way to tell them to send some cloth over?" Wang Guizhen braved the cold wind and ran into the Erlong Road Neighborhood Service Center, breathlessly saying to the Deputy Director Liu Fenglan.

Liu Fenglan looked at the small cotton-padded jacket in Wang Guizhen's hand and said, "It will take a few days for them to send the cloth, and they are busy with production in the factory and don't have time. It's cold, don't let the children freeze." As she spoke, Liu Fenglan took out two pieces of blue cloth, similar in color to the cotton-padded jacket, from a package and told Wang Guizhen to quickly make it for them.

Although the Erlong Road Neighborhood Service Center had rushed to make more than 700 pieces of cotton clothing for the surrounding residents before winter, it has been particularly busy since winter began. Some young mothers don't worry until it gets cold. One day, Fu Xiuwen, a female worker from the cardboard box factory, brought a package of old cotton clothes, asking that they be dismantled, washed, and sewn within two or three days, saying that the children were waiting to wear them. So the older sisters and elder women in the service center dismantled some, washed some, and mended some. In less than three days, Liu Fenglan sent a package of clean cotton clothes to Fu Xiuwen's home. Fu Xiuwen took the cotton clothes and gratefully said to Liu Fenglan, "Great, the children won't freeze, and I can rest assured in production."

Before winter, the staff of the Erlong Road Neighborhood Service Center held an emergency mobilization meeting. They ensured that the surrounding residents would have a warm winter, and that people working in government offices and factories would not have to worry about household chores. So, these enthusiastic housekeepers went deep into each family to visit, providing wind shields to those who lacked them, pasting doors and windows for those whose doors and windows were not tight, and helping people move coal when they bought it. They guaranteed to do whatever they could. Street cadres publicized that in order to prevent gas poisoning, every household must install a wind shield, but many people didn't have them. Deputy Director Li Shufang said, "People are busy with production in the factory, don't let them run all over the street to buy wind shields." Everyone worked together, using old straw and paper dismantled from nearby exhibitions, to paste wind shields for the residents. One day, Shang's grandson from Number 15 ran to the service center and said, "Grandpa asked Grandpa Hua Peizhang to help install the stove." Hua Peizhang heard the message, took his tools, and left, installing the stove for Shang's family.

Why are these people so active? Deputy Director Liu Fenglan put it well, "Most of us working in the neighborhood service center are housewives, but today's housewives can't just work for their own small families. Everyone strives to do more for the socialist big family, and contribute more. We share the chores of the residents' families, so that people working and producing outside can concentrate on building socialism with greater vigor."

Auntie's Heart is Warm, Babies are Warm

Early in the morning, as soon as the nursery worker Zhao Jingzhen woke up, she heard the howling wind outside the window. Forgetting to take care of her housework, and forgetting that it was her day off, she rushed to the Dafosi Kindergarten to add clothes for the children. But she felt very warm when she stepped into the kindergarten, because the nursery worker on duty had already started the stove. A group of innocent and lively children rushed up, calling out affectionately, "Hello, Auntie! Hello, Auntie!"

When early winter arrived, the busiest person in this street kindergarten was still the head of the kindergarten, Peng Xiaohui. This old head of the kindergarten, in her sixties, watched as the weather turned cold, and with a motherly heart, she ran around all day, sometimes arranging to install stoves, and sometimes planning to buy coal. In winter, there will be more indoor activities for the children. She also ran to the Wangfujing Department Store to select indoor children's toys. After she had arranged all the preparations for the children to spend the winter, she thought about the children's diet again. Before the head of the kindergarten could speak, the cook Zhang Shuying had already strengthened the insulation of the children's meals as the weather turned cooler. Although she cooked for more than 120 children alone, she had to make sure that every meal was steaming hot and delivered to the children's mouths.

"Taking good care of children is better than being a mother, and children come to the kindergarten better than being at home." This is the loud slogan put forward by all the nursery workers in welcoming the winter childcare work. What they say, they do. They carried out winter disease prevention activities throughout the kindergarten, inviting medical staff from the hospital outpatient department to come to the kindergarten to inject the children with pertussis prevention vaccine, and tried every means to prevent weak children from catching colds or bronchitis. Nursery worker Lu Naiying noticed that Yang Susu, who was over three years old, coughed when it got cold, so she paid special attention to her. She took extra care of this child every day, not only adding or subtracting clothes according to the cold or heat of the weather, but also specially wrapping a scarf around the child when she participated in outdoor activities or got off work and went home, so as not to let the cold wind blow on her. Yang Susu's parents saw that the child was taken care of better than at home, and sent a letter of thanks to the kindergarten with gratitude, which read: "Thank you - hard-working gardeners, your day and night labor is cultivating the flowers of the motherland - the successors of communism."

The Elderly Live Strong in Their Later Years

After the start of winter, two new things happened in the Tianzhu敬老院 (Home of Respect for the Elderly) of the Zhangxizhuang People's Commune in Shunyi District, Beijing: Liu Shigui, who had been walking with crutches for many years, threw away his crutches and walked; and Zhang Wenzhi, who suffered from severe arthritis, did not lie on the kang (heated brick bed) in winter for the first time. Moreover, she became the leader of the vegetable growing group in the home, leading everyone to grow vegetables.

Liu Shigui and Zhang Wenzhi were both old people who had worked for landlords all their lives. The life before liberation, worse than that of cattle and horses, ruined their health. A year ago, when they entered the Home of Respect for the Elderly because they were lonely and no one cared for them, they were too sick to walk. One was carried in on someone's back, and the other was pulled in by a large cart.

People inside and outside the home were happy for the rejuvenation of the two old people. When people came to visit them, they smiled and said to the visitors, "The food is good here, the clothes are good, if it weren't for the Home of Respect for the Elderly, how could our bodies have become so good!"

Now that winter has arrived, all 56 old people in the home are wearing cotton clothes and cotton boots. The old men wear felt hats, and the old women wear black velvet hats. Some of the old women have small feet, and they can't buy suitable cotton shoes in the market, so the two female directors made them by hand a month ago.

Although the residences in the home are one of the best houses in this commune, before winter, people were sent to plaster them with mud again. The windows were also repapered, and the fire kangs were all heated up. Dozens of stoves were also placed in the warehouse in the home, and a lot of coal briquettes were piled up outside. If it gets colder, the stoves will be lit immediately.

In order to make the old people in the home spend the winter well, the Party organization of the commune recently held a meeting to specifically study this issue, and after the meeting, they brought dozens of cotton coats for the old people. In order to prevent the old people from getting sick at the beginning of winter, the commune's hospital has been coming to the home every day to check them.

Being in the old people's rooms, the atmosphere of joy makes it difficult to imagine that the biting north wind is blowing outside the doors and windows. Here, the windows are bright and clean, the light is sufficient, and the fragrant September chrysanthemums are blooming in the flowerpots in the corners of the walls. Some of the old people are reading newspapers, some are playing chess, and some are sitting cross-legged on the warm kang, closing their eyes to rest. Ma Laiyuan, who has always been very active and blind, has attracted some of the old people to his side to compile interesting doggerel. He sang: "The northwest wind blows in gusts of cold, the happy home is warm. Wearing cotton clothes, sleeping on a warm kang, white flour dumplings are fragrant. Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, make our old people's later life strong."

    冬天里的春天
    本报记者　慧贤　孔诚　世恺
    冬天来了。当人们正热火朝天地为提前完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而决战的时刻，在生产战线的后方，有许许多多的“管家人”担负着和大跃进血肉相关的工作。他们崇高的劳动同样散发出强烈的光和热。
    饭热菜香工棚暖
    在北京热电站工地。外面刮着五级寒风，可是宽敞明亮的工地食堂却温暖如春。炊事员为建筑工人们做了打卤面，还为爱吃米饭、馒头的人做了猪肉烧罗卜，烧面筋、菠菜炒粉条等几十种菜，他们把菜盛好，分别放在特制的保暖灶里，旁边，是一大盆免费的酸辣汤，热气腾腾。食堂外面，排着三辆汽车和手推车，这是给工人送饭用的，炊事班长严会荣像指挥员似地，站在汽车上让炊事员递给他一个厚棉被，把饭菜盖得严严的。中午下班了，建筑工人们一拥而入，每人选购了一份自己爱吃的饭菜，围着干净的桌子有说有笑地吃着，整个饭厅喜气洋洋。而远离食堂的洋灰、土方工人们，也都吃到炊事员们送来的同在食堂一样的饭菜。
    这个工地的几千工人都住在有暖气的大楼里，而食堂和工棚也都安好了炉子。炊事员们为了保证建筑工人们在冬天吃好，开过好几次会，他们给工人们订了“冬季食谱”，工人们每星期内可以吃到三十多种菜，十六种饭，每天饭菜不重样，还常常吃到水饺。
    这个工地正在进行第二期工程，建筑工人们保证在11月20日使新安装的十万瓩的发电机满负荷发电，支援首都工业生产。而炊事人员的战斗口号是：
    起早贪晚火旁忙，
    做出饭菜热又香，
    职工饱餐身体壮，
    精神百倍干劲强。
    热心的管家人
    “刘大姐，怎么办？这两件小棉袄袖子都短一大块，没法做，想个什么办法告诉人家送点布来呢？”王桂珍冒着寒风跑进二龙路邻里服务所，进门上气不接下气地对副主任刘凤兰说。
    刘凤兰看着王桂珍手上的小棉袄说：“要人家送布来，得等几天，而且人家在工厂忙着生产，也没有空儿，天冷了，别让人家孩子冻着。”说着，刘凤兰就从一个包袱里拿出同棉袄颜色差不多深浅的两块蓝布给王桂珍，告诉她快给人家做好。
    尽管二龙路邻里服务所早在入冬以前就为周围的居民赶做了七百多件棉衣，但是入冬以来还是格外地忙。有些年轻的母亲天不冷不着急，有一天，纸盒工厂的女工傅秀文拿来一包旧棉衣，要求三两天就给她拆洗干净，并且缝好，说孩子们都等着穿呢。于是服务所的大嫂和老大娘们有的给拆，有的给洗，有的给补，不到三天，刘凤兰就把一包干干净净的棉衣送到傅秀文的家里。傅秀文接过棉衣来感激地对刘凤兰说：“太好了，孩子冻不着，我生产也放心了。”
    入冬以前，二龙路邻里服务所的工作人员就开过紧急动员会议，他们保证让周围居民都暖暖和和地过冬，绝不让在机关和工厂工作的人为家庭琐事操心。于是，这些热心的管家人深入到每个家庭去访问，看谁家缺风斗，就给风斗，谁家门窗不严就给糊门窗，谁家买了煤就帮助人家搬煤。只要他们能办到的事，他们就保证给做好。街道干部宣传，为了防止煤气中毒，家家都要安风斗，可是许多人家没有。副主任李淑芳说：“人家都在工厂忙生产呢，别让人家为买风斗满街跑了。”大家一齐动手，用附近展览会拆下来的旧禾秸和纸，为居民糊好了风斗。有一天，十五号尚家的小孙儿跑到服务所说：“爷爷请华佩章老大爷帮忙安炉子。”华佩章听到信，拿上工具就走，给尚家安好了炉子。
    这些人为什么这样积极呢？副主任刘凤兰说得好，我们在邻里服务所工作的绝大部分都是家庭妇女，可是今天的家庭妇女可不能光为自己的小家庭了，大家都争取为社会主义大家庭多做些事，多出一把力，我们分担了居民家的琐事，在外边工作和生产的人就能安心地用更大的干劲建设社会主义。”
    阿姨心热娃娃暖
    清早，保育员赵静珍刚醒，就听见窗外狂风怒吼。她顾不得料理家务，更忘了自己是轮休，急忙赶到大佛寺幼儿园给孩子增添衣服。可是她迈进园里却感到很暖，原来值班的保育员早把炉火升着了。一群天真活泼的孩子一哄而上，亲热地喊叫：“阿姨好！阿姨好！”
    当初冬降临的时候，在这个街道幼儿园里，最忙碌的人还是园长彭筱惠。这位六十多岁的老园长，眼看天寒了，怀着慈母一般的心肠整天东奔西跑，有时张罗安装炉火，有时又筹划购煤。冬天，孩子的室内活动要增多了。她又跑到王府井百货大楼去选购室内儿童玩具。她把孩子过冬的准备工作都安排好了，又惦念起孩子的饮食。没等园长开口，炊事员张淑英早就随着天气转凉加强了孩子饭菜的保温工作。她尽管一个人做一百二十多个孩子的饭菜，也要做到顿顿饭样样菜都得热气腾腾地送到孩子的嘴前。
    “带好孩子赛妈妈，孩子来园胜在家。”这是全园保育员在迎接冬季保育工作时提出的响亮口号。她们说得到，就做得到。在全园开展了冬季防病活动，邀请医院门诊部派医务人员来园给孩子注射预防百日咳的药剂，又千方百计地预防体弱孩子患感冒或气管炎。保育员陆乃英发现三岁多的杨苏苏遇到天冷就咳嗽，心中就格外留神了。她每天就加意照顾这个孩子，不仅按照天气冷热添减衣服，等孩子参加室外活动或下班回家，还特意给孩子围好围巾，不让冷风吹着。杨苏苏的家长看到孩子比在家时还照顾得好，怀着感激的心情给幼儿园送来一幅感谢状，上面这样写着：“感谢你们——辛勤的园丁，你们夜以继日的劳动，培育着祖国的花朵——共产主义的接班人。”
    老人晚年生活强
    入冬以后，京郊顺义区张喜庄人民公社天竺敬老院里发生了两件新事：许多年来依靠拐杖走路的刘世贵扔掉了拐杖走路；患着严重关节炎的张文芝第一次没有在冬天卧倒在炕上，而且还当了院内种菜组的组长，领导大家种菜。
    刘世贵和张文芝，都是给地主扛过一辈子长活的老人。解放前，牛马不如的生活，累坏了他们的身体。一年以前，当他们因孤独无人照管而入敬老院的时候，由于病重不能走路，是一个叫人背来，一个叫大车拉来的。
    院内外的人都为两位老人的回春而感到高兴。当人们来访问他们的时候，他们就笑嘻嘻地对来客说：“这里吃得好，穿得好，要不是敬老院，我们的身子骨哪能变得这么好！”
    现在，冬天到了，全院五十六位老人都穿上棉服，登上棉靴。老大爷戴上毡帽，老太太们戴起乌黑的绒帽。有些老太太脚小，市上买不到合适的棉鞋，两位妇女院长在一个月前，就给她们亲手赶做出来了。
    院内的住屋虽然是这个公社最好的房子之一，可是在入冬之前，又派人给抹了一次泥。窗子也重新糊过了，火炕都烧得热呼呼的。在院内的库房里还放着几十个炉子，屋外堆着不少的煤球。如果天再冷了，炉子也马上会生起来。
    为了使院内的老人冬天过得好，公社的党组织最近又开会专门研究了这个问题，会后给老人们拿来了几十件棉大衣。公社的医院为了不叫老人们在入冬时发病，最近每天都要来院里检查一次。
    置身在老人们的寝室里，那一片欢愉的气氛，使人们很难想象就在门窗外面正刮着刺骨的北风。这里窗明几净，光线充足，墙角的花盆里盛开着芬芳的九月菊。老人们有的在看报，有的在玩象棋，有的盘膝坐在暖炕上闭目养神，一向很活跃的双目失明的马来元，又把一部分老人吸引到自己的周围编起有趣的顺口溜。他唱道：“西北风刮起阵阵凉，幸福院里暖洋洋。穿棉衣，睡热炕，白面饺子喷喷香。毛主席，共产党，使我们老人晚年生活强。”
