Xinhua News Agency, Vandenberg (USA), November 10th: The U.S. Air Force's "Discoverer VII" artificial satellite, launched on the 7th, has again failed. The sealed container it carried failed to detach from the satellite as planned. The U.S. Air Force had no choice but to announce on the 8th that the container's return to Earth was hopeless.

This is the third time that the U.S. "Discoverer" satellite has suffered the same failure.

It is said that the reason for this failure was a malfunction in the satellite's power supply, which prevented the container from detaching from the satellite body on its seventeenth orbit around the Earth. At the same time, due to the power supply problem, the satellite's orbit is extremely unstable. It is estimated that it will only exist in space for two weeks.

Previously, the U.S.-launched "Discoverer" satellites III and IV failed to enter orbit at all; "Discoverer" V and VI, although they entered orbit, their containers went missing. It is said that this was also due to power supply problems. The satellites themselves only existed for about a month before falling into the Earth's atmosphere and disintegrating.

    美国卫星第三次失灵
    容器返回地面无望
    新华社10日讯　范登堡（美国）消息：美国空军在7日发射的人造地球卫星“发现者七号”又告失灵，它携带的密封容器未能按照计划脱离卫星。美国空军不得不在8日宣布，容器返回地面无望。
    这已经是美国“发现者”卫星第三次遭到同样的失败了。
    据说，这次失败的原因是卫星上的电源出了毛病，没有能够使容器在卫星绕地球转第十七圈时脱离卫星本体。同时，由于电源出了毛病，卫星运行的轨道极不稳定。据估计，它只能在空间存在两个星期。
    在这以前，美国发射的“发现者”卫星三号和四号根本未能进入轨道；“发现者”五号和六号虽然进入了轨道，但它们携带的容器却不知去向。据说，这也是因为电源出了毛病。卫星本身只存在了一个月左右就掉进地球大气层殒灭了。
