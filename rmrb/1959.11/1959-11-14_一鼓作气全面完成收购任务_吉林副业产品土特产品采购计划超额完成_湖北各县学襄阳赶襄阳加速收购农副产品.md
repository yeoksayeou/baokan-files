    Completing the Acquisition Task in One Go
    Jilin Exceeds Procurement Plan for Sideline and Specialty Products
    Hubei Counties Learn from Xiangyang and Accelerate Acquisition of Agricultural and Sideline Products
    This newspaper reports that Jilin Province completed its annual procurement plan for rural sideline and specialty products (including flue-cured tobacco, live pigs, poultry, minor oilseeds, wild plants, and animal products) by the end of October, exceeding the target.
    The main characteristics of Jilin Province's rural sideline and specialty product procurement work this year are: early start, tight grip, and meticulous attention. The mass movement is characterized by rapid momentum, fast progress, and large acquisition volume. As early as August, before wild plants were fully mature, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee made comprehensive arrangements for the production, acquisition, processing, and transportation of agricultural and sideline products, demanding that all localities grasp procurement work with greater vigor. After the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced, the broad masses of cadres and farmers throughout the province were high in spirit and, in September and October, organized seven planned offensives, launching two major upsurges.
    The first procurement upsurge, grasping the gap in agricultural production from mid-August to the end of September, organized four offensives. The province mobilized 1.18 million people, who went to the deep mountains, dense forests, and grasslands, engaging in sideline production. Acquisition points increased from more than 3,000 to more than 10,000. The total acquisition value for September alone was equivalent to one-third of the annual acquisition target, an increase of two and a half times over the same period last year. By the end of September, the total completion of the annual rural sideline and specialty product acquisition plan was over 74%.
    Entering the busy autumn harvest season in October, which is also the key period for the procurement of wild plants, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promptly proposed to continue strengthening leadership over sideline production while doing a good job in autumn harvest, deep plowing, and transporting requisitioned grain, ensuring the completion of the annual acquisition plan one month ahead of schedule, and achieving the requirement of further increasing the income of each rural resident. Based on the specific instructions of the Provincial Committee, all localities arranged labor and transportation forces more meticulously, dividing the production, acquisition, and transportation fronts for mutual cooperation; organizing more than 10,000 permanent, seasonal, and long-distance professional teams, adopting a combination of regular procurement and surprise procurement methods, and launching three more offensives, forming a second major upsurge. By October 31, the province had completed a total acquisition value of more than 280 million yuan, an increase of 83% over the same period last year, accounting for 104.7% of the annual acquisition plan. A total of more than 2.9 million tons of various wild plants were collected.
    This newspaper reports that after completing the annual agricultural and sideline product procurement plan three months ahead of schedule, the commercial departments of Xiangyang County, Hubei Province, exceeded the annual procurement plan by 40% in October, becoming a red banner for the entire province.
    In all procurement work, the commercial departments of Xiangyang County have consistently implemented the viewpoint of organizing production and serving production. They clearly recognized that production is the material basis for acquisition, and only expanding production can expand acquisition. To support production, they organized and supplied more than 700,000 catties of seeds such as sugarcane, sugar beets, and radix rehmanniae at the beginning of the year, and more than 110,000 catties of rapeseed in the autumn. They also sent 55 technical cadres to live in the countryside for a long time to guide production and trained more than 1,600 technicians for the people's communes. Because they actively guided production, Shuang'gou Commune alone acquired 450,000 catties of black melon seeds, more than 10,000 catties of bee honey, and more than 20,000 catties of tobacco leaves in September, expanding the acquisition volume by 280,000 yuan.
    Based on the experience of vigorously carrying out mass movements last year, this county gave full play to the role of the 400 supply and marketing departments of each production team. At the same time, it mobilized market vendors to form a procurement army of more than 2,000 people, which extensively went deep into the countryside for procurement.
    Recently, the whole province is carrying out a ten-competition movement to learn from Xiangyang and catch up with Xiangyang (comparing total acquisition amount, comparing upward transfer, comparing major varieties, comparing average per capita income, etc.). As of November 11, 40 counties in the province had completed their annual agricultural and sideline product procurement plans.

    一鼓作气全面完成收购任务
    吉林副业产品土特产品采购计划超额完成
    湖北各县学襄阳赶襄阳加速收购农副产品
    本报讯　吉林省已于10月底超额完成了全年农村副业产品和土特产品收购计划（包括烤烟、生猪、家禽、小油料、野生植物、畜产品等）。
    吉林省今年农村副业产品、土特产品采购工作的主要特点是：抓的早、抓的紧、抓的细，群众运动的特点是来势猛，进度快，收购量大。远在8月份野生植物还没完全成熟的时候，中共吉林省委和省人民委员会，就对农副土特产品的生产、收购、加工、调运等工作做了全面布置，要求各地要以更大劲头抓采购工作。党的八届八中全会决议公布以后，全省广大干部和农民斗志昂扬，在9、10两个月内，有计划地组织了七次突击，掀起了两次大高潮。
    第一次采购高潮，是抓住8月中旬到9月末农业生产挂锄空隙，组织了四次突击。全省出动一百一十八万人，分赴深山密林和草原，投入副业生产，收购点由三千多处增加到一万多处，9月份一个月的收购总值相当于全年收购任务的三分之一，比去年同期增加两倍半。9月底总共完成全年农村副业产品和土特产品收购计划的74％以上。
    进入10月秋收繁忙季节，也是采购野生植物的关键时期，中共吉林省委及时提出了在搞好秋收，深翻地和运送征购粮的前提下，继续加强对副业生产的领导，保证提前一个月完成全年收购计划，实现每个农村人口进一步增加收入的要求。各地根据省委的具体指示，更加细致地安排了劳动力和运输力，划分生产、收购、运输三条战线互相配合；组织常年、季节、远征三种专业队伍一万多个，采取经常采购和突击采购相结合的方法，又掀起三次突击，形成了第二次大高潮。到10月31日，全省完成收购总值二亿八千多万元，比去年同期增加83％，为全年收购计划的104.7％。共采集各种野生植物二百九十多万吨。
    本报讯　湖北省襄阳县商业部门在提前三个月完成全年农副产品采购计划之后，10月份又超过全年采购计划40％，成为全省一面大红旗。
    襄阳县商业部门在全部采购工作中，自始至终都贯彻了组织生产，服务生产的观点。他们清楚地认识到，生产是收购的物质基础，只有扩大生产才能扩大收购。为了扶植生产，他们年初便根据县委发展多种经营的规划，组织和供应了甘蔗、甜菜、生地等种籽七十多万斤，秋季又供应菜籽十一万多斤。他们还派了五十五个技术干部，长期住在农村指导生产，并为人民公社训练了一千六百多个技术员。由于他们积极指导生产，仅在双沟公社9月份就收购了黑瓜子四十五万斤、蜂糖一万多斤、烟叶二万多斤，扩大收购量二十八万元。
    这个县根据去年大搞群众运动的经验，一方面充分发挥各生产小队的四百个供销部的作用。同时，还发动了市场商贩，组成两千多人的收购大军，普遍深入农村采购。
    最近，全省正开展一个学襄阳、赶襄阳的十比竞赛运动（比收购总额、比上调、比主要品种、比人员平均收入等）。截至11月11日止，全省已有四十个县完成了全年的农副产品采购计划。
