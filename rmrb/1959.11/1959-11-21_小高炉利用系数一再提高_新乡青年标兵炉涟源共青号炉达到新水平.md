Small Blast Furnace Utilization Rate Continues to Increase
Xinxiang Youth Pace-Setter Furnace, Lianyuan "Communist Youth League" Furnace, Reaches New Level

(Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, 20th dispatch) After setting a high-yield record of 40 tons of iron per day last month, the workers of the No. 2, 13-cubic-meter blast furnace of the Xinxiang City No. 2 Steel Plant, Henan Province, vigorously carried out technological innovation and, on the 13th, set a new record of 53.215 tons of iron per day, with a utilization coefficient of 4.093.

This blast furnace is a famous youth pace-setter furnace in Henan Province. In the process of continuous leap forward, the workers, in the spirit of the Party's General Line, boldly conceived and experimented, reformed technology, and greatly broke the "peak production theory." Zhao Jingru, the hot blast stove leader, Wang Xianqing, and Li Canpu, in collaboration with two members of the furnace repair team, after repeated research, made fifteen major technological transformations to the hot blast stove. The hot blast stove was changed from low-level multi-nozzle combustion, improved the furnace type, and combusted from the side, so that the exhaust gas was discharged quickly and the gas entered the furnace smoothly; the dust collector was changed from a concave bottom to a 60-degree slope, and the tubes in the furnace were changed from upright to oblique, increasing from 40 to 70. After these two major technological transformations, the wind temperature increased from 550 degrees to 580 degrees to about 680 degrees. At the same time, three more fans were added for parallel air supply, and the hot air pressure increased from 170 mm of mercury to about 220 mm, meeting the air volume required by the blast furnace and improving the smelting intensity. They also worked in many ways to improve the ore grade, strengthen coal washing and coking, so that the ash content of coke decreased from 23% to 17%, and the sulfur content decreased from 1% to 0.88%. The ore was roasted in large piles and pre-roasted to burn off moisture, sulfur, and other impurities, turning poor ore into rich ore, and the grade was increased from the original 50% iron content to more than 67%.

(Our newspaper, Changsha, 20th dispatch) The "Communist Youth League" small blast furnace with a volume of five cubic meters at the Anping Iron Plant in Lianyuan County, Hunan Province, set a new record on November 5th of producing 21 tons of pig iron per day, with a utilization coefficient as high as 4.2 and 100% quality compliance.

The main technical measures for high yield and high quality of the "Communist Youth League" small blast furnace are to increase the air volume, increase the air temperature, and strengthen raw material management. At the beginning of September this year, when renovating this 5.06-cubic-meter furnace, which had been shut down for more than half a year, the Party organization of the iron plant fully mobilized the masses to boldly reform the furnace structure, hot air system, and blower equipment. In mid-September, the furnace was put into production, and in the seventeen days to the end of the month, the average daily production of pig iron was 10.25 tons, the utilization coefficient reached 2.05, and the pig iron qualification rate reached 82%. In October, the daily output of pig iron was stable at 10 to 12 tons, and the average qualification rate also rose to 90%.

Beginning in November, with the help of factory leaders, technicians, and veteran workers, the workers further carried out technological innovations. They used a Roots blower and two used high-pressure centrifugal electric fans to achieve three-machine parallel wind, so that the small blast furnace had 13 to 15 times the air volume per cubic meter of volume. The wind pressure rose from the original 100 mm to 120 to 140 mm, and the wind temperature rose to about 700 degrees Celsius. In terms of strengthening raw material management, the workers put forward the slogan of "ironmaking outside the furnace." In addition to reducing the particle size of ore and coke, they also insisted on "four selections" of ore (selection at the exit of the mine, selection before roasting, screening selection, and charging selection) and "three non-entrances" (raw ore, good stone impurities, and non-compliant specifications are not allowed to enter the furnace). Due to the large air volume, high air temperature, and good furnace charge, this furnace produced a total of 201.5 tons of pig iron in the first half of November, with an average daily output of 13.43 tons, an average utilization coefficient of 2.686, and a qualification rate of 98%.

    小高炉利用系数一再提高
    新乡青年标兵炉涟源共青号炉达到新水平
    本报郑州20日电　河南省新乡市第二钢铁厂二号十三立方米高炉职工，上月创日产四十吨高产纪录后，又大搞技术革新，于13日再创日产铁五十三点二一五吨，利用系数达四点零九三的新纪录。
    这座高炉是河南省著名的青年标兵炉，职工们在持续跃进的过程中，不断以党的总路线的精神，大胆设想、试验，革新技术，大破“生产到顶论”。热风炉长赵敬儒、王显卿、李灿普协同修炉队二人，经过反复研究，对热风炉进行了十五项重大的技术改造。把热风炉由低位多咀燃烧，经改进炉型，从侧面燃烧，使废气排出快，煤气入炉畅通；除尘器由凹底改为六十度斜坡，炉内管子由正装改为斜装，由四十根增加到七十根。经过这两项重大技术改造，风温由五百五十度至五百八十度，提高到六百八十度左右。同时增加三个风机并联送风，热风压由一百七十个水银柱提高到二百二十个左右，满足了高炉所需风量，提高了冶炼强度。还多方提高矿石品位，加强洗煤、炼焦，使焦炭灰分由23％降低到17％，硫分由1％降低到0.88％。对矿石采用大堆焙烧、预焙烧等办法，烧去了水分、硫分和其他杂质，使穷矿变成了富矿，品位由原来含铁量50％提高到67％以上。
    本报长沙20日电　湖南省涟源县安平铁厂五立方米的共青号小高炉，11月5日创日产生铁二十一吨，利用系数高达四点二、质量百分之百合格的新纪录。
    共青号小高炉高产优质的主要技术措施是增大风量、提高风温和加强原材料管理。今年9月初，在改建这座停炉半年多的五点零六立方米的炉子的时候，铁厂党组织充分发动群众对炉子的结构、热风系统、鼓风设备等进行了大胆革新。9月中旬，炉子投入生产，到月底的十七天中，平均日产生铁十点二五吨，利用系数达到二点零五，生铁合格率达到82％。10月份生铁日产量稳定在十至十二吨，平均合格率也上升到90％。
    11月份开始，工人们在工厂领导干部、技术员、老工人的帮助下，进一步大搞技术革新。他们用一台罗茨鼓风机和已使用的两台高压离心电动通风机实行三机并风，使小高炉每立方米容积有十三至十五倍风量。风压从原来的一百毫米上升到一百二十至一百四十毫米，风温提高到摄氏七百度左右。在加强原材料管理方面，工人们提出了“炉外炼铁”的口号，除了把矿砂、焦炭颗粒改小外，还坚持矿砂“四选”（出窿选、焙烧前选、筛矿选、上料选）、“三不入”（生矿、好石杂质和不合规格的不入炉）。由于风量大、风温高、炉料好，11月上半月这座炉子共生产生铁二百零一点五吨，平均日产量达到十三点四三吨，平均利用系数达到二点六八六，合格率达到98％。
