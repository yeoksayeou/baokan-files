Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 4th: Vientiane Dispatch: Lao Kingdom Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone told reporters in Vientiane on the 3rd that the trial of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front would be held as soon as the "preliminary investigation" was completed.

Sananikone said that the postponement of the trial was due to "judicial reasons."

The day before Sananikone made the above remarks, the Lao Kingdom Ministry of Justice announced that the trial of Prince Souphanouvong and others would be postponed for two to four weeks. Sananikone's remarks show that the Lao Kingdom government is using this time to intensify the fabrication of false "evidence" and stubbornly implement the conspiracy of the US-Sananikone clique to persecute Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

Referring to the issue of US "aid," Sananikone said that his talks in the United States were "beneficial."

When talking about the upcoming visit to Laos by United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, Sananikone revealed that Hammarskjöld might request the Security Council to agree to send his personal representative to Laos.

Sananikone also expressed his hope that "the United Nations mission in Laos will remain" in order to facilitate the United States to further interfere in Laos under the guise of the United Nations.

    萨纳尼空透露
    将加紧捏造“罪证”迫害苏发努冯
    新华社河内4日电　万象消息：老挝王国首相培·萨纳尼空3日在万象接见记者时说，对苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的审判，一俟“初步调查”结束的时候，将尽快地举行。
    萨纳尼空说，这次审判的延期是由于“司法上的原因”。
    在萨纳尼空发表上述谈话的前一天，老挝王国司法部曾经宣布对苏发努冯亲王等人的审判推迟两个到四个星期。萨纳尼空的上述谈话表明，老挝王国政府正在利用这段时间加紧制造假“罪证”，顽固地要实现美萨集团迫害苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的阴谋。
    萨纳尼空谈到美“援”问题时说，他在美国的会谈是“有益的”。
    萨纳尼空在谈到联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德将对老挝进行的访问时透露，哈马舍尔德有可能要求安全理事会同意派他的私人代表到老挝来。
    萨纳尼空还表示希望“联合国驻老挝代表团将留下来”，以便于美国假借联合国的名义对老挝进行进一步的干涉。
