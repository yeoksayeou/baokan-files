Xinhua News Agency, November 10th: Today, representatives of employees in the light industry system held a leap forward broadcast rally, calling for a vigorous effort in November and December to strive for the early and comprehensive completion of this year's national plan, to produce more and better inexpensive, high-quality, and diverse products to support industry and agriculture, and to meet the needs of the people.

Vice Premier of the State Council Bo Yibo, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Liu Ningyi, and Vice Chairman of the National Women's Federation Deng Yingchao all participated in the conference and delivered speeches.

The broadcast rally was presided over by Li Zhuchen, Minister of Light Industry. He said that this broadcast rally is a leap forward mobilization rally for employees in the national light industry and handicraft industries. Through this conference, light industry and handicraft production should leap forward, leap forward again, and leap forward still further.

Vice Premier of the State Council Bo Yibo spoke at the meeting. Bo Yibo said that this year, the production of light industry and handicrafts, like other sectors of the national economy, has achieved new victories of continued leap forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. In the first three quarters, light industrial products increased by 10% to 30% compared with the same period last year. There has also been a large increase in the variety and quantity of handicraft products. The production of daily necessities, small hardware, small farm tools, small tools, and arts and crafts has developed even faster. After rectification in the first half of the year, the people's commune industry has strengthened production management, and production has also greatly improved. The achievement of these results is due to the fact that the employees of light industry, handicrafts, and people's commune industry, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, are full of enthusiasm, doing everything possible, and overcoming difficulties through self-reliance.

Bo Yibo said that the continued leap forward situation in China's national economy has put increasingly high demands on light industry, handicrafts, and people's commune industry. The bumper harvest in agriculture and the upcoming peak market season after autumn require the supply of a large number of light industrial products and handicrafts, and a large number of agricultural and sideline products also need to be processed. The "three autumns" work and the new upsurge of farmland water conservancy construction that will appear this winter and next spring require the supply of a large number of farm tools, a large number of tools, and fertilizers and pesticides. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the production of light industrial products and handicrafts needed for people's daily use as soon as possible, and actively develop commune industry on the basis of consolidation and improvement, in order to meet the needs of the people's lives, support agricultural production, and serve the needs of large-scale industry and exports; this is of great significance for overfulfilling this year's national economic plan, striving for a continued leap forward next year, especially ensuring that the production in the first quarter of next year is not lower than the production level in the fourth quarter of this year.

Bo Yibo also put forward specific requirements for the current production work of light industry and handicrafts. He said that in the production work of light industry and handicrafts, it is necessary to vigorously launch mass movements and resolutely implement the mass line. At present, many regions are carrying out the "small autumn harvest" work in addition to the "three autumns," which is to mobilize the masses to go to the mountains to collect wild plant fibers, fruits, and grass roots. These things are all excellent raw materials for light industry and handicrafts, and they must be used locally, manufactured locally, and used locally to ensure full utilization. When Bo Yibo talked about vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, he said that every employee should carry forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and boldly propose and boldly try to produce. He particularly emphasized that it is necessary to start with the transformation of existing tools, rely on our own efforts, use a combination of foreign and local methods, arm ourselves, and gradually realize semi-mechanized and mechanized production. When Bo Yibo talked about doing everything possible to tap all kinds of potential to expand the source of raw materials for light industry and handicrafts, he particularly emphasized the need to "find rice to cook," actively tap the potential of local materials, rely on our own efforts; actively carry out the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products and the use of substitute raw materials. For example, wild fibers and wild fruits can be used to make paper, textiles, wine, and oil; the leftover scraps from large factories can be used as raw materials for light industry and handicrafts. In short, we must do everything possible to expand the source of raw materials and create more wealth for society. Finally, Bo Yibo also talked about actively developing people's commune industry on the basis of consolidation and improvement.

Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Liu Ningyi pointed out in his speech that the characteristic of the new upsurge of mass movements on the light industry front is that production is leaping forward in an all-round way and rising in a straight line. He said that the upsurge of mass production movements should be carried out continuously, so that it will develop forward in waves, making next year "off to a good start", "good every ten days", "good every month" and "full of red." He called on the employees of the light industry system to fully carry out the socialist labor competition of "learning, comparing, catching up, and helping." We must not only compare with the advanced, but also compare with mutual cooperation, and we must plant red flags in every group, workshop, and enterprise. Truly achieve "heroes are everywhere" and "a hundred flowers bloom in spring." Liu Ningyi also said that a large part of the enterprises in the light industry system are manual labor, so it is necessary to constantly carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, and let the flowers of technical innovation bloom in every corner of the light industry system. Strive to achieve semi-mechanization and mechanization to improve labor productivity.

Vice Chairman of the National Women's Federation Deng Yingchao said at the conference that with the Great Leap Forward in light industry production, since last year, female employees in light industry generally account for about 40% of the total number of employees. In industries such as sewing, food, and cigarettes, women account for more than 60%, and in arts and crafts industries such as embroidery, crochet, and applique, women account for more than 80%. Most of these female employees were housewives not long ago, but now they have learned production technology and business management to varying degrees, and many advanced collectives and advanced producers have emerged. She also called on all female employees on the light industry and handicraft fronts to join hands with male employees to continue to improve their communist consciousness, work hard to study technology, and continue to improve their cultural and scientific level, to further push the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution to a new upsurge, and to strive to run collective living welfare undertakings well, and gradually realize the socialization of housework, so that female employees can concentrate more on production, work and study, and make greater contributions to socialist construction.

Deputy Minister of Light Industry Deng Jie also spoke at the meeting. He said that since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a new situation of rising production every ten days and increasing every month has emerged on the light industry front. Among the thirty-two major products, the output of twenty-two products in September increased by more than 20% compared with August, and other products also increased to varying degrees; in October, the output of many major products increased by more than 10% compared with September. The production situation of handicrafts is also thriving. According to the statistics of fourteen large and medium-sized cities in the third quarter, they generally overfulfilled the total output value plan by 10% to 50%. Deng Jie said that the main tasks now facing us are: to actively develop the production of light industry and handicrafts to supply people with more and better daily necessities, which is also an important aspect of our support for agriculture and the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. On the other hand, in supporting agricultural production, we must also actively develop the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products, fully supply the rural areas with a large number of feed and fertilizers such as distiller's grains, oil cakes, and beet waste silk; actively develop service industries such as shoe making, sewing, and food, thereby liberating the rural labor force; especially the employees and members of handicrafts and commune industries should firmly establish the concept of serving agriculture, earnestly do a good job in the manufacture and repair of various farm tools and tools needed by agriculture, and cooperate with the machinery industry sector to support agriculture to gradually realize mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification. Deng Jie pointed out that in order to complete the above tasks, we must focus on doing four things well: First, further oppose right-leaning and encourage hard work, and carry out the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy more deeply and continuously; second, strengthen cooperation, and vigorously grasp raw materials and materials, especially raw materials and materials produced by agriculture and sideline industries; third, vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution; fourth, launch a broader and deeper new upsurge of labor competition of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping, so that "flowers bloom everywhere and red flags spread all over" on the light industry and handicraft fronts, and production leaps to a new level.

The representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers who spoke at the broadcast rally unanimously expressed their determination to strive to complete this year's national plan ahead of schedule, and introduced outstanding experiences in various aspects.

At today's broadcast rally, the proposals put forward by the representatives of advanced producers at the light industry system experience exchange meeting were also read out.

During the conference, hundreds of telegrams and many long-distance calls expressing determination, reporting good news, and responding to the proposals were received from light industry and handicraft employees from all over the country who listened to the live broadcast of the conference.

    全国轻工业系统职工在广播大会上誓师跃进
    保证轻工产品价廉物美丰富多彩
    薄一波号召扩大原料来源积极发展轻工业手工业生产为社会创造更多财富
    据新华社10日讯　今天轻工业系统职工代表举行跃进广播大会，号召大干11、12两个月，争取提前和全面地完成今年国家计划，生产更多更好的价廉物美、丰富多采的产品，来支援工业和农业，满足人民生活需要。
    国务院副总理薄一波、中华全国总工会主席刘宁一、全国妇联副主席邓颖超都参加了大会并且讲了话。
    广播大会由轻工业部部长李烛尘主持。他说，这次广播大会是全国轻工业和手工业职工的跃进誓师大会，通过这次大会，要使轻工业和手工业生产跃进、跃进、再跃进。
    国务院副总理薄一波在会上讲了话。薄一波说，今年轻工业、手工业的生产也同国民经济其它部门一样，又在去年大跃进的基础上，取得了继续跃进的新的胜利。在前三个季度，轻工业产品分别比去年同期增长了10％到30％。手工业产品的品种和数量也有很大的增加，日用小百货、小五金、小农具、小工具和工艺美术品的生产，则发展得更快。人民公社工业经过上半年的整顿，加强了生产管理，生产也有很大的提高。这些成绩的取得，是轻工业、手工业和人民公社工业的职工们，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，干劲冲天，千方百计，自力更生地克服困难的结果。
    薄一波说，我国国民经济继续跃进的局面，对轻工业、手工业和人民公社工业，提出了越来越高的要求。农业丰收，秋后市场旺季即将到来，要求供应大量的轻工业品和手工业品，大量的农副产品也有待加工处理，“三秋”工作以及今冬明春即将出现的农田水利建设新高潮，要求供应大批的农具、大批的工具和肥料、农药。因此，应该尽快地增加人民日用必需的轻工业品和手工业品的生产，在巩固、提高的基础上积极地发展公社工业，以满足人民生活需要，支援农业生产，为大工业和出口的需要服务；这对于超额完成今年的国民经济计划，争取明年继续跃进，特别是保证明年第一季度的生产不低于今年第四季度的生产水平，具有十分重要的意义。
    薄一波还对轻工业和手工业当前的生产工作提出了具体要求。他说，在轻工业和手工业的生产工作中，必须大搞群众运动，坚决贯彻群众路线。现在许多地区正在“三秋”之外进行“小秋收”的工作，这就是发动群众上山采集野生植物的纤维、果实和草根等。这些东西都是轻工业和手工业的大好原料，必须就地取材、就地制造、就地使用，保证充分利用。薄一波谈到大闹技术革新和技术革命的问题时，他说，每一个职工都应该发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，大胆倡议，大胆试制。他特别强调要从改造现有工具入手，自力更生，用洋土结合的办法，自己武装自己，逐步实现半机械化和机械化生产。薄一波在谈到千方百计地挖掘各种潜力来扩大轻工业和手工业的原料来源时，他特别强调要“找米下锅”，积极挖掘地方物资潜力，自力更生；积极开展对农副产品的综合利用和采用代用原料。例如野生纤维和野生果实可以造纸、纺织、酿酒和榨油；大厂用剩的边材废料，更可以做轻工业和手工业的原料。总之，要千方百计地扩大原料来源，为社会创造更多的财富。最后，薄一波还谈到了在巩固和提高的基础上积极地发展人民公社工业的问题。
    中华全国总工会主席刘宁一在讲话中指出，当前轻工业战线上群众运动新高潮的特点是，生产全面跃进、直线上升。他说，应当使群众生产运动高潮持续地开展起来，使它一浪高一浪地向前发展，作到明年“开门红”、“旬旬红”、“月月红”、“满堂红”。他号召轻工业系统的职工充分开展“学、比、赶、帮”的社会主义劳动竞赛。既要比先进，又要比互相协作，要在每个小组、车间、企业都插上红旗。真正作到“英雄旁边皆好汉”，“万紫千红才是春”。刘宁一还说，轻工业系统的企业有很大部分是手工劳动，因此要不断地进行技术革新和技术革命，把技术革新的花朵开遍轻工业系统的每个角落。努力实现半机械化和机械化，来提高劳动生产率。
    全国妇女联合会副主席邓颖超在大会上说，随着轻工业生产的大跃进，去年以来轻工业中女职工一般占职工总数的40％左右。缝纫、食品、卷烟等行业中，妇女占60％以上，工艺美术如刺绣、挑补花等行业中，妇女达到80％以上。这些女职工中的大多数，不久以前还是家庭妇女，现在已经在不同程度上学会了生产技术和经营管理，还涌现出不少先进集体和先进生产者。她还号召轻工业和手工业战线上的全体女职工，和男职工一道，继续提高共产主义觉悟，努力钻研技术，继续提高文化科学水平，把技术革新和技术革命的群众运动进一步推向新的高潮，要努力办好集体生活福利事业，逐步实现家务劳动社会化，使女职工能更加集中精力，搞好生产、工作和学习，为社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。
    轻工业部副部长邓洁也在会上讲了话。他说，自从党的八届八中全会以来，轻工业战线上出现了生产旬旬上升、月月增长的新局面，三十二种主要产品中，9月份有二十二种的产量比8月份增长了20％以上，其它产品也有不同程度的增长；10月份又有不少主要产品的产量比9月份增长了10％以上。手工业的生产情况也欣欣向荣。根据十四个大中城市第三季度的统计，一般都超额10％到50％完成了总产值计划。邓洁说，现在摆在我们面前的主要任务是：积极发展轻工业和手工业的生产，以供应人们更多更好的生活必需品，这也是我们支援农业和巩固工农联盟的一个重要方面。另一方面，在支援农业生产上，还要积极发展农副产品加工工业，充分供应农村大量的酒糟、油饼、甜菜废丝等饲料和肥料；积极发展制鞋、缝纫、食品等服务性工业，从而解放农村的劳动力；特别是手工业和公社工业的职工和社员，更应该牢固地树立为农业服务的观点，认真作好农业所需要的各种农具、工具的制造和修配，配合机械工业部门，支援农业逐步实现机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化。邓洁指出，为完成上述任务，要着重做好四项工作：一、进一步反右倾、鼓干劲，更加深入、持续地开展群众性的增产节约运动；二、加强协作，大抓原料和材料，特别是农副业所生产的原料和材料；三、大闹技术革新和技术革命；四、掀起一个更广泛、更深入的比、学、赶、帮的劳动竞赛新高潮，使轻工业和手工业战线上“满园花开，红旗遍地”，生产跃进到新的水平。
    在广播大会上讲话的先进集体代表和先进生产者，一致表示决心争取提前完成今年的国家计划，并且介绍了各个方面的突出经验。
    今天的广播大会上，还宣读了先进生产者代表们在轻工业系统经验交流会议上提出的倡议书。
    大会进行过程中，收到了各地收听广播大会实况的轻工业和手工业职工，从各地发来的几百份表示决心、报捷和响应倡议的电报和许多长途电话。
