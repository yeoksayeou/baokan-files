Seven Plays
　　Tian Han
Since the National Day gift performances, many good plays have been staged in Beijing. It seems that the comrades in the drama circles of various provinces and cities are not only full of energy but also bursting with talent, which is gratifying. There are several noteworthy features: most of the plays performed are collectively created or adapted by actors and directors; although the art of acting and directing follows the path of realism, it gradually forms different styles depending on the region and the target audience; and all are learning from tradition and the Soviet Union with great enthusiasm. Due to being busy, I cannot comment on each one, so I will write seven quatrains to congratulate their success.

　　I. General Political Department Drama Troupe et al. perform "On the 38th Parallel"
　　Entering the net, demons don't realize,
　　Holding knives, they are lost children.
　　Old fortresses outside the city grow autumn grass,
　　Peacetime firepower resembles wartime.

　　II. Nanjing Frontline Drama Troupe performs "Eastward March Overture"
　　The Red Army talks and laughs as they break through the encirclement,
　　Directing the stubborn foes with ease.
　　A lively debate east of the river,
　　Remembering loved ones amidst the flames of war.

　　(1)
　　(1) "Special Envoy Chen" is said to be written about Comrade Chen Nongfei.

　　III. Jiangxi Provincial Drama Troupe performs "August 1st Storm"
　　Overnight, a great wind rises in Nanchang,
　　Zhou Gong plans strategies in the building.
　　Though heroes shed blood at Hongmen,
　　The military flag is won, spreading across the land.

　　IV. Hebei Provincial Drama Troupe performs "Red Flag Spectrum"
　　Clear streams and loyal blood, enduring a mournful gaze?
　　Returning after twenty years, resentment unfulfilled.
　　Oppressive taxes are not eliminated, people will not disperse,
　　Red flags fly all over the ancient city.

　　V. Harbin Drama Theatre performs "Optimistic Tragedy"
　　The political commissar is a slender young woman,
　　Yet she tames fierce soldiers and controls wolves.
　　The day of victory through roundabout routes,
　　Why decline to be wrapped in horsehide for the country!

　　VI. Benxi City Drama Troupe performs "Red Heart Tiger Courage"
　　Starting a business is difficult since ancient times,
　　Sacrificing oneself to save magnesium, a soaring spirit.
　　Why should Little Tian feel ashamed?
　　There are always affectionate broadcasters.

　　VII. Gansu Provincial Drama Troupe performs "Rolling Bailong River"
　　(2)
　　Why not strengthen fixed pasturing over nomadic pasturing?
　　Green pastures for thousands of miles, grazing cattle and sheep.
　　Laugh at those youngsters brandishing mantis arms,
　　The rolling torrent cannot be stopped!

　　(2) "Rolling Bailong River" is a sequel to "Kangbu'er Grassland."

    话剧七首
  　田汉
    国庆献礼以来又有许多好话剧到北京演出，看起来各省市话剧工作同志不止干劲冲天，也才华怒发，真是可喜。有几个值得注意的特色，即演出的剧本大多数是演员导演们集体创作或改编的；表导演艺术虽同走现实主义道路，却随地区和服务对象不同渐次形成不同风格；都在以很高热情向传统学习，向苏联学习。由于忙，不能一一评介，谨成绝句七首，借贺成功。
    一、总政话剧团等演“三八线上”入网群魔不自知，持刀原是失娘儿。开城旧垒生秋草，火力平时似战时。
    二、南京前线话剧团演“东进序曲”红军谈笑突重围，直叫群顽听指挥。舌战江东风趣绝，从容兵火忆侬菲。
    （一）
    （一）“陈特派员”云是写陈侬菲同志事。三、江西省话剧团演“八一风暴”一夜南昌起大风，运筹楼上有周公。鸿门纵沥英雄血，赢得军旗遍地红。四、河北省话剧团演“红旗谱”清流碧血忍凝眸？廿载归来恨未休。苛税不除人不散，红旗飞满古城头。五、哈尔滨话剧院演“乐观的悲剧”政委纤纤一女郎，却驯悍卒御豺狼。迂回两路收功日，马革何辞裹国殇！六、本溪市话剧团演“红心虎胆”创业艰难自古然，舍身救镁劲冲天。小田何必惭形秽？自有多情广播员。七、甘肃省话剧团演“滚滚的白龙江”（二）游牧何如定牧强？青青千里放牛羊。笑他竖子张螳臂，滚滚洪流不可当！
    （二）“滚滚的白龙江”系“康布尔草原”续篇。
