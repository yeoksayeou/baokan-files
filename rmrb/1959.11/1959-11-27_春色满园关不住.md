    Spring Colors Fill the Garden, But Can't Be Contained
    Hong Helin
    I heard that the winding team of the electrolytic capacitor workshop of the North China Radio Equipment Factory is in a lively competition, "racing against time for capacitors," with everyone trying to outdo each other. This team is an advanced collective that attended the Conference of Heroes. Their revolutionary enthusiasm attracted me to visit them.
    The competition is so intense that, in the workers' words, "the distance between first and last is only a few hairs." If someone winds one capacitor slower than the others, they won't be able to catch up for an hour or two. Dozens of female workers are operating with complete concentration. When I entered the workshop, not a single person looked up. No one wants to bring even the slightest blemish to the collective honor due to their own slowness or negligence. Later, when I talked to a girl about the team's competition to be advanced and catch up with the advanced, she pointed to the competition chart filled with "red rockets" and said to me, "We really have 'spring colors filling the garden, but can't be contained' here."
    Indeed, the socialist spring breeze has made the girls' hearts bloom. They are changing the face of their work every day and every hour. Experiences from even a day or a few hours ago are already outdated for them. They also have times when they are not happy. Several female workers once talked to me about their three unpleasantries: first, doing less than others; second, learning less; and third, having fewer inventions and creations, which affected the collective glory.
    Sun Ziying, the leader of the winding team and a pacesetter in the whole team's competition, also thinks this way. The only difference is that she feels it more strongly and thinks further ahead. After returning from the Conference of Heroes, she has been thinking all day about how to continue to maintain the collective honor and strive to attend the Conference of Heroes again next year; how to simplify the complex manual winding operation and realize winding mechanization… These questions sometimes make her so excited that she cannot sleep. But when she returned to the team, this worry was replaced by a new kind of confidence. She found that not only had all the sisters quickly mastered her fourteen advanced operating methods, but they had also created eighteen new operating experiences, and many people had become skilled girls who regularly exceeded their quotas, and the team's daily output was increasing day by day. Apprentice Qi Shumin even surpassed her master Zhao Yuzhi in terms of output, quality, and low consumption, becoming the team's new pacesetter. What made Sun Ziying even happier was that most of the sisters in the team, including many backward comrades, were determined to catch up with and surpass her. The argument that "Sun Ziying is fast with her hands and mind, and even eats and walks fast, we are just slow with our hands and mind, and can't catch up with her no matter what" has disappeared, replaced by the idea that:
  "Sun Ziying is also human, she has two hands and so do I, if she can do it, why can't I!"
    Seventeen-year-old Qi Shumin caught up with her master Zhao Yuzhi with this kind of drive and determination. This little girl is advanced in everything, but she doesn't like to talk much. I asked her for a long time, but she didn't admit that she was competing with Zhao Yuzhi. But all the sisters in the team know this open secret. I also asked Qi Shumin: "Why do you want to catch up with Zhao Yuzhi and Sun Ziying?" She seemed to be stumped by this question, and after holding back for a long time, she said with a red face:
  "I just want to do more for socialism when I'm young, otherwise I won't be able to do anything when I'm old and have to walk with a cane…; let me tell you how to catch up with Master Zhao? Didn't Master Sun Ziying also catch up with Master Zhao with a burst of energy!"
    Speaking of Sun Ziying catching up with Zhao Yuzhi, we must also explain an "episode." Zhao Yuzhi was originally the oldest pacesetter in the team. Her advanced advantage was taken away by the "skilled girl" Sun Ziying more than a year ago. Although Zhao Yuzhi was second to Sun Ziying, she was still considered second in the team. So she thought: it is difficult to catch up with Sun Ziying, but it is still okay to maintain the current speed. But before long, Qi Shumin caught up, and Yang Yuxia was also rated as a six-good apprentice. Wang Xiumin jumped from failing to meet the quota to becoming a new record creator. Zhao Yuzhi realized that she was wrong. She realized that if she continued to do things according to the old calendar, she would be left behind. She wrote a letter of determination to the Party, expressing her firm determination to catch up. Of course, the first step is to catch up with Little Qi. In the past month or so, the competition between Zhao Yuzhi and Qi Shumin has become increasingly intense. When they return to the dormitory in the evening, they exchange "information" and experience from the day, and then work hard and cleverly as soon as they go to work the next day. These days, they have been evenly matched, with no winner or loser.
    It's not just Zhao Yuzhi and Qi Shumin who are buried in their work
  "comparing, learning, catching up," the workers of the entire team and even the entire factory are also "preoccupied," striving to be more and more advanced. The advanced seeds of the Conference of Heroes have blossomed into朵朵鲜花 here, and countless buds are being conceived and growing. Wang Jingyun, a young apprentice who failed to fully complete the production plan for seventeen days in October, no longer emphasized that the equipment was poor and the master's help was insufficient after hearing about the deeds of the advanced producer Liu Yajun not long ago. She repeatedly thought: "Liu Yajun is eighteen years old, I am nineteen years old, she uses a lathe, I also use a lathe, she is a girl, I am also a girl, why has she stepped into 1963, and I haven't even reached 1960 yet?" This question mark turned into strength, and she immediately discussed with Xiao Wang and Xiao Qin on the same lathe that they must catch up with Yajun, learn from Ziying, and strive for an advanced honor for the collective that has always been behind, and the three of them must also step into 1960 ahead of schedule. After three or four days and five or six hard and clever efforts, the average daily output of the three of them has soared from 1,100 finished products to 2,600.
    Now many workers who are at the forefront have a common characteristic, that is, they are conscientious and down-to-earth. They always consider: "Other people's enthusiasm is more than their own, and other people's methods are better than their own." When the winding team is singing and advancing to catch up with the national advanced level, the sisters of the other two winding teams who are challenging them are also catching up at high speed. I asked Sun Ziying and another team leader who is leading among the three teams now, but they answered in unison with another answer: "We cannot turn 'leading' into a burden in our progress, we should think more about how to catch up faster and help more comrades catch up with the advanced level!"
    Now this factory is not only Sun Ziying who is seriously formulating plans to help the backward and signing contracts with apprentices to guarantee teaching and learning, but also hundreds of skilled people like Sun Ziying who can help the backward have emerged. They leave the difficulties to themselves and teach their experiences to their comrades. Whether you are in the workshop, corridor, indoors or outdoors, whether it is big-character posters or loudspeakers, you can hear the sound of imparting advanced experience everywhere, and some even knock on gongs and drums to send experience to others. Here, it is truly an ocean of mass wisdom, and everyone's little bit of essence quickly becomes the collective wealth, and the collective experience is inspiring everyone to send out new sparks of wisdom.
    When I left this factory and stepped on the way home in the face of the north wind, the factory area in the eastern suburbs was already brightly lit, and the stars in the night sky were shining. As I walked, I thought: Although it is the cold winter season, a colorful spring on the capital's industrial front has arrived ahead of schedule.

    春色满园关不住
    洪和临
    听说华北无线电器材厂电解电容器车间卷绕小组，正在“同时间争夺电容器”，你追我赶，热闹非凡。这个小组是出席群英会的一个先进集体。她们的革命干劲吸引着我来拜访他们。
    这场竞赛是如此紧张，用工人们的话来形容，就是“一先一后的距离只差几根头发丝”，谁要比别人慢卷了一个电容器，就一两个小时也追不上。几十个女工全神贯注地操作着，当我走进车间时没有一个人抬头望一眼。谁也不愿因自己的怠慢和疏忽给集体荣誉带来一点瑕疵。后来，当我同一位姑娘谈起这个小组比先进、赶先进竞赛，她指着布满了“红色火箭”的竞赛表对我说：“咱们这儿真是‘春色满园关不住’”。
    的确，社会主义的春风吹拂得姑娘们心花怒放。她们每日每时都在改变着自己工作的面貌。一天以前甚至几个小时以前的经历，对于她们来说已经是陈腐的了。她们也有不舒心的时候。几位女工就曾经同我谈到了她们的三件不愉快：一是比别人干的少，二是自己学的少，三是发明创造少，影响了集体的光荣。
    卷绕小组的组长——全组竞赛标兵孙紫英也是这样想的。所不同的只是她比姊妹们感受的更强烈，想的更远些。她出席群英会回来，整天都在考虑着怎样继续保持集体荣誉，争取明年再出席群英会；如何简化手工卷绕操作的复杂工序，实现卷绕机械化……。这些问题有时使她激动得不能安眠。但是当她回到小组以后，这种担心又被一种新的信心所代替了。她发现：全组姊妹不仅迅速掌握了自己的十四项先进操作法，而且创造出十八条新的操作经验，很多人成为经常超产的巧姑娘，全组日产量日日上升。徒工齐淑敏在产量、质量、低耗方面甚至赶到了她师傅赵玉芝的前头，成为小组的新标兵。更使孙紫英高兴的是，全组大部分姊妹，包括许多后进的同志在内，都下决心赶上和超过自己。“孙紫英手快、心快，连吃饭走路也快，咱们就是手笨心慢，怎么也赶不上她”的论调消声敛迹了，代之而起的思想是：
  “孙紫英也是人，她有两只手我也有两只手，她干的出，为什么我干不出！”
    十七岁的齐淑敏就是凭着这么一股子干劲和钻劲赶上她师傅赵玉芝的。这位小姑娘什么都先进，就是不大喜欢讲话。我问她许久，她也不承认自己在同赵玉芝竞赛。可是全组姊妹都了解这个公开的秘密。我又问齐淑敏：“你为什么要赶赵玉芝和孙紫英？”她似乎为这个问题难住了，憋了好久才红着脸说：
  “我就是想趁年青时候给社会主义多干点，不然老了拄上拐棍就干不动了……；让我说怎么赶赵师傅？孙紫英师傅不也是一鼓劲就赶过了赵师傅么！”
    提起孙紫英赶赵玉芝，还要交代一段“插曲”。赵玉芝原先是全组最老的标兵。她的先进优势一年多以前被“巧姑娘”孙紫英夺去了。赵玉芝虽然次于孙紫英，但在小组还算第二。于是她就想：赶孙紫英有困难，能保持现在这个速度也还可以。可是不多久，齐淑敏就赶上来了，杨玉霞也被评为六好徒工。王秀敏由达不到定额一跃成为新纪录创造者。赵玉芝发觉自己想错了。她意识到再按照老皇历办事就要被甩在最后。她向党写了决心书，表示坚决赶上去。当然，第一步就要追上小齐。近一个多月来，赵玉芝和齐淑敏的竞赛越来越白热化了，晚间她俩回到宿舍就互相交换当天的“情报”和经验，第二天一上班就猛干巧干。这些天来她两一直是势均力敌，不分胜负。
    岂止赵玉芝、齐淑敏在埋头
  “比、学、赶”，全组以至全厂的工人们也都是“各怀心事”，力争先进再先进。群英会的先进种子在这里已经开出了朵朵鲜花，无数的蓓蕾正在孕育着、成长着。10月份十七天没有全面完成生产计划的青年徒工王景云，不久以前听到先进生产者刘雅君的事迹以后，再也不强调设备差，师傅帮助不够了。她反复地想：“刘雅君十八岁，我十九岁，她使车床，我也使车床，她是姑娘，我也是姑娘，为什么她跨进了1963年，我连1960年还没有达到？”这个问号变成了力量，她马上和同车床的小王、小秦商量，一定要赶雅君，学紫英，给从来落后的集体争取个先进的荣誉，她们三个人也要提前跨进1960年。经过三四天五六次的苦干和巧干，她们三个人平均日产水平竟从一千一百个成品猛增到二千六百个。
    现在许多走在前边的工人们，有一个共同的特点，就是兢兢业业，踏踏实实。他们总是考虑：“别人的干劲比自己还要足，别人的办法比自己还要好。”当卷绕小组正为赶上全国先进水平而高歌猛进的时候，和她们挑战的另外两个卷绕小组的姊妹们也在高速度地追上前来。我问孙紫英和另一个小组长，这三个组现在谁领先，她们却异口同声地作了另外的答复：“不能把‘领先’变成自己前进中的包袱，应当多考虑怎样更快地赶上前去，帮助更多的同志赶上先进水平！”
    现在这个厂不仅是一个孙紫英在认真地制订帮助后进计划，同徒工们订包教包学合同，而是涌现了几百个像孙紫英那样的帮后进能手。他们把困难留给自己，把经验教给同志。不论你在车间、走廊、室内、室外，不论是大字报和扩音器，到处都可以听到传授先进经验的声音，有的还敲锣打鼓把经验给别人送上门去。这里，真是群众智慧的海洋，每个人一点一滴的精华迅速变成集体的财富，集体的经验又在启发着每个人发出新的智慧的火花。
    当我离开这个工厂，迎着北风踏上归途时，东郊工厂区已是万家灯火，夜空里群星闪铄。我一边走一边想：虽然是寒冬季节，但是首都工业战线上一个万紫千红的春天已经提前到来了。
