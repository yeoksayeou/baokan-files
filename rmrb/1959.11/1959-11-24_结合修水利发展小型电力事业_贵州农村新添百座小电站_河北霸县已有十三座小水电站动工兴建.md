Xinhua News Agency, Guizhou, 23rd: Guizhou Province is actively building small-scale hydro and thermal power stations in conjunction with water conservancy construction and other work. As of November 18, the province has completed and started supplying electricity from one hundred and four small power stations this year, with an installed capacity of 2,071.8 kilowatts. More than three hundred others are still under construction.

At present, in areas where small power stations have been completed, most can use cheap electricity for lighting and to drive machinery for pumping water, rice milling, and flour grinding, which has improved production efficiency and saved a large amount of labor. During the autumn harvest, Xieqiao Commune in Tongren County used electricity generated by three hydropower stations built this year to drive threshing machines, increasing efficiency tenfold compared to manual labor, thereby accelerating the progress of the autumn harvest.

Guizhou is a mountainous province with many rivers and most counties produce coal, which provides conditions for building hydro or thermal power stations. People's communes have relied on the masses to solve the problems of manpower, materials, and finances in the construction of small power stations. The funds for the more than one hundred small power stations that have been completed in the province have all been raised by the communes themselves. The members of the Luowan People's Commune in Guiyang City dispelled the mysterious view of power generation, burned cement and made gunpowder themselves, and used water mills to modify power equipment. It only took them a month to build the power station, and the investment per kilowatt of electricity was half that of ordinary rural power stations. In the past nine months, this commune has completed seven power stations, and eleven more are under construction. When Liping County in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture built the Fukuo Hydropower Station, the commune members dared to think and act, and successfully experimented with using wooden elbows instead of iron elbows, ensuring the timely power generation of the power station.

In order to manage these power stations well, various special districts (autonomous prefectures) and counties throughout the province are taking measures such as master-apprentice training, old station leading new station, and running short-term training courses to vigorously train electrical technicians.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd: The Baxian County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has mobilized the masses to build a number of small power stations while building water conservancy projects. At present, a total of thirteen small hydropower stations have been started in the county.

Baxian borders the Yongding River to the north, and the Mang River, Drainage Ditch, and Baimi Canal run north-south through the county. Because the county's terrain is high in the north and low in the south with a large slope, the river and canal flow rate is high, which is conducive to the development of small-scale hydropower. After the thirteen power stations that have been started are completed, they can guarantee water conservancy irrigation, agricultural product processing, local industrial electricity and partial lighting electricity for eight communes including Liuquan, Suqiao, and Yongqing in northern Baxian. According to preliminary calculations, 45,000 laborers and nearly 10,000 livestock can be saved and invested in other production. (Attached picture)

### 结合修水利发展小型电力事业  贵州农村新添百座小电站  河北霸县已有十三座小水电站动工兴建

    结合修水利发展小型电力事业
    贵州农村新添百座小电站
    河北霸县已有十三座小水电站动工兴建
    新华社贵州23日电　贵州省农村结合兴修水利等工作积极建设小型水力和火力发电站。到11月18日止，全省今年已经建成并开始送电的小型电站有一百零四座，装机容量二千零七十一点八瓩。还有三百多座正在继续施工。
    目前，已经建成小型电站的地区，大部分能使用廉价的电力照明和带动机器抽水、碾米、磨面，提高了生产效率，节省了大批的劳动力。铜仁县谢桥公社在秋收中利用今年建成的三座水电站发的电带动打谷机打谷，效率比人工提高十倍，因而加快了秋收进度。
    贵州山区河流纵横，大部分县都产煤，具有兴办水力或火力电站的条件。各人民公社在兴建小型电站中，依靠群众解决了人力、物力、财力的问题。全省已经建成的一百多座小电站，资金都是公社自筹的。贵阳市洛湾人民公社的社员，破除了办电的神秘观点，自己烧水泥、做火药，利用水碾改制动力设备，只用一个月的时间就将电站建成，每瓩电的投资比一般农村电站的投资低一半。九个月来，这个公社已建成电站七座，还有十一座正在动工兴建。黔东南苗族侗族自治州黎平县兴建付廓水电站时，社员们敢想敢干，试验成功用木质弯管代替铁质弯管，保证了电站及时发电。
    为了把这些电站管好，全省各专区（州）、县正在采取师傅带徒弟、老站带新站和开办短期训练班等办法，大力培训电气技术人员。
    新华社天津23日电　中共霸县县委发动群众在水利建设的同时，兴办一部分小型电站。目前，全县已经动工兴建的小型水力发电站共有十三座。
    霸县北界永定河，境内有牤河、排水沟、百米渠三条河渠贯穿南北，由于全县地势北高南低坡度较大，河渠流速急，便于发展小型水力发电事业。目前已经开工的十三座电站建成后，可以保证霸县北部柳泉、苏桥、永清等八个公社的水利灌溉，农产品加工，地方工业用电和部分照明用电。据初步计算，能节约出四万五千个劳动力、近万头牲畜，投入其它生产。（附图片）
