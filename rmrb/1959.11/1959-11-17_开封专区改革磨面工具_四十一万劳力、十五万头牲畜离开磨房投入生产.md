    Kaifeng Prefecture Reforms Flour Milling Tools
    410,000 Laborers and 150,000 Livestock Leave Mills to Engage in Production

    (Our Dispatch) Kaifeng Prefecture, Henan, while vigorously pursuing "Three Autumns" production, launched a cooking utensil reform movement centered on improving flour milling tools. As of October 16th, 158 people's communes and 3,379 brigades in the prefecture had abolished human-powered mills, reforming a total of 17,005 sets of various flour milling tools. Over 12,000 sets were already in normal production, producing 10,114,400 catties of flour daily. Based on a consumption of one catty of flour per person per day, 93.44% of the prefecture's population could eat flour processed by improved mills. This freed 410,000 laborers and 150,000 livestock from the mills, allowing them to engage in "Three Autumns" production.

    The common characteristics of the various improved mills throughout the prefecture are: locally sourced materials, low cost, simple manufacturing, convenient operation, and a general increase in work efficiency of three to five times, with some exceeding ten times.

    The rapid and effective improvement of flour milling tools in the Kaifeng area is the result of strengthened leadership by Party committees at all levels. At the beginning of the movement, some people expressed a lack of confidence. They said, "It's okay to focus on some, but it can't all be changed in a short time." "A full-scale effort would be wasteful." In short, they did not believe in the power and wisdom of the masses. In response to these ideas, the Kaifeng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held three on-site meetings in Qi County, Yongcheng, and Zhongmu in early September, respectively. On the basis of unifying the thinking of cadres, they selected improved stone mill models suitable for various regions and required rapid promotion throughout the prefecture. Comrade Jiang Tao, First Secretary of the Qi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in addition to personally grasping and guiding this work, also went deep into the communes to help solve problems in the reform of flour milling tools. For example, after discovering the advantages of installing automatic grain feeding equipment on steel mills in Gegang Commune, he promptly convened a telephone conference to promote it throughout the county, thereby reducing the number of people operating steel mills in the county from 576 to 213. After five days of intensive effort, Luzhao Commune in Huaiyang County universally reformed flour milling tools, increasing the commune's flour milling efficiency sixfold and freeing up 2,679 laborers for production.

    All localities, based on the principles of relying on the masses, self-reliance, local materials, bold creation, and continuous innovation, launched mass movements to improve stone mills. Luquan Commune in Dongming County relied on commune members to solve the problem of wood, stone and other materials, enabling the commune to quickly install 80 water-powered mills, producing 120,000 catties of flour per day, solving the commune's noodle consumption problem. Employees of the iron factory in Gegang Commune, Qi County, put forward 79 rationalization proposals in the installation and improvement of steel mills. In order to quickly disseminate experience, various localities also used on-site meetings, visits, comparisons, and methods such as inviting masters and taking apprentices to spread advanced experience throughout the county in one day and throughout the prefecture in three days.

    Organizing large-scale cooperation among relevant departments also accelerated the development of this work. In the steel mill installation movement in Qi County, the industrial sector was responsible for the manufacturing, repair, installation, and operator training of steel mills, while the commercial sector was responsible for the supply of raw materials. All departments worked together, so that all steel mills in the county were quickly installed, breaking through the technical barrier.

### 开封专区改革磨面工具  四十一万劳力、十五万头牲畜离开磨房投入生产

    开封专区改革磨面工具
    四十一万劳力、十五万头牲畜离开磨房投入生产
    本报讯　河南开封地区在大搞“三秋”生产的同时，开展了以改良磨面工具为中心的炊具改革运动。截至10月16日，全区已有一百五十八个人民公社、三千三百七十九个大队取消了人推磨，共改制各种磨面工具一万七千零五套，已经投入正常生产的有一万二千多套，日产面粉一千零一十一万四千四百斤，按每人每天吃一斤面粉计算，全区93.44％的人口可以吃到改良磨加工的面粉。从而使四十一万劳动力和十五万头牲口离开磨房，投入了“三秋”生产。
    全区各种改良磨的共同的特点是：就地取材，成本低，制造简单，操作方便，工效一般都提高三倍到五倍，有的提高十倍以上。
    开封地区又快又好地改良磨面工具，是各级党委加强领导的结果。运动一开始，有些人表现信心不足。他们说：“重点搞些可以，全部都改不是短时间可以完成的。”“全面开花，会造成浪费。”总之，他们不相信群众的力量与智慧。针对这些思想，中共开封地委在9月上旬分别在?县、永城、中牟召开了三次现场会，在统一干部思想的基础上，选定了适合各种不同地区的改良石磨型号，要求在全区内迅速推广。中共?县委员会第一书记江涛同志除亲自掌握指导这一工作外，还深入公社具体帮助解决磨面工具改革中的问题。如在葛岗公社发现钢磨装上自动添粮设备的好处以后，便及时召开电话会，向全县推广，从而使全县操作钢磨的人数由五百七十六人，减少到二百一十三人。淮阳县鲁召公社全社经过五天突击，就普遍改革了磨面工具，全社磨面效率比以前提高了六倍，腾出了二千六百七十九名劳动力投入了生产。
    各地都本着依靠群众，自力更生，就地取材，大胆创造，不断革新的原则，开展了群众性的改良石磨运动。东明县陆圈公社依靠社员解决木料、石头等器材，使全社很快安装起八十盘水打磨，日产面粉十二万斤，解决了全社吃面问题。?县葛岗公社铁工厂的职工，在安装和改进钢磨中提出了七十九条合理化建议。为了迅速传播经验。各地还运用现场会、参观评比和请师傅、带徒弟等办法，使先进经验一天内传播全县，三天传遍全区。
    组织有关部门大协作，也加速了这一工作的开展。?县在安装钢磨运动中，工业部门负责钢磨制造、修理、安装和操作人员的培训工作，商业部门负责原材料供应，各部门拧成一股绳，因而使全县所有钢磨很快地安装了起来，突破了技术关。
