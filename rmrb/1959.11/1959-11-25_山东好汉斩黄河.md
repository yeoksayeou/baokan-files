    Shandong Heroes Cut the Yellow River
    By Our Correspondent Jiang Wenpin
    The Yellow River, this muddy dragon that discharges thousands of miles a day, upon entering Shandong Province, is about to be cut in half and obediently listen to arrangements.
    The people of Shandong, through the increased production facts of the Great Leap Forward, have further recognized the importance of "water." The largest water source within Shandong Province is the Yellow River, which has plagued them for generations.
    The Weishan Water Conservancy Hub Project of the Yellow River is an important component of the comprehensive plan to control the Yellow River's water hazards and develop Yellow River water conservancy. This project has the comprehensive benefits of flood control, ice control, irrigation, power generation, and navigation. It is one of the main cascade development projects on the Yellow River and the water conservancy heart of Shandong. In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, it was approved by the Central Government and started a year ahead of schedule. Last autumn, 250,000 people entered the construction site, fought for eighty days, and used 18 million cubic meters of earthwork to build a 200-li-long lake embankment from the ground, constructing a Dongping Lake reservoir with a total area of 628 square kilometers and a storage capacity of 4 billion cubic meters, almost twice as large as the famous Guanting Reservoir. At the same time, massive structures such as the river-blocking gate, the lake outlet gate, the Yellow River diversion gate, the diversion gate, and the desilting basin were built one after another, completing the first and second phases of the Weishan Water Conservancy Hub, and achieving the first victory in controlling the Yellow River! This year, the people of Shandong, advancing on the crest of victory, started the third phase of the project, centered on forcing the Yellow River to change its course, on October 15. This phase of the project requires the construction of three inlet gates, one sand prevention gate, one ship lock, and five huge buildings; the excavation of four diversion channels with a total length of more than 17,000 meters; and the construction of a river-blocking dam. The total earthwork task is over 14.6 million cubic meters, rock excavation and masonry is 440,000 cubic meters, concrete pouring is over 90,000 cubic meters, and 7.5 million kilograms of sorghum stalks are needed. Such a vast project, to complete the excavation of the diversion channel and the Yellow River cutoff project within sixty days before the ice flood, is an arduous task. However, people are encouraged by a beautiful vision. After this phase of the project is completed, the Yellow River can be cut off in the middle. In the future, in the event of particularly large floods or ice floods, the river-blocking gate can be used to intercept the water and force it to enter Dongping Lake through the inlet gate. Under normal flow, it can swallow the Yellow River's water flow for thirty days; during the spring and winter dry seasons of the Yellow River, the Dongping Lake reservoir will open the large mouth of the outlet gate and release a flow of 4,000 cubic meters per second, which can not only facilitate navigation but also meet the irrigation water needs of 40 million mu of land along the river. After the three power stations of the Weishan Hub are completed, they can generate 25,000 kilowatts of electricity. The Weishan Hub project also has a special benefit: it will use the water storage of Dongping Lake Reservoir to revive the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, which has been suspended for sixty or seventy years. The rich and beautiful Dongping Lake Reservoir can also produce 2 billion jin of fat fish every year. The Weishan Water Conservancy Hub Project, with its numerous benefits and wide range of uses, is like a huge magnet, tightly attracting the hearts of the people of Shandong.
    Walking out of the Weishan Engineering Bureau and following the west bank of the Yellow River for four or five li, is the Yellow River cutoff site. The materials used for the cutoff are piled up like mountains. The large and small boats in the river channel are transporting a large number of materials, equipment, vegetables, and grain to this place. Four huge ferries are filled with migrant workers wrapped in white towels, carts, luggage, and cooking utensils. The tireless firewheels are sending people to the other side. The riverbank is dusty from being trampled by vehicles, horses, and people.
    Guiding the Yellow River cutoff project here are more than thirty veteran river workers with forty, fifty, or sixty years of cutoff experience. These are local experts. Among them is an old man named Xue Jiuling, who is seventy-eight years old this year. He became a river worker when he was sixteen years old. These old people, who are familiar with the Yellow River's water conditions, are not using the modern methods used in the Three Gate Gorge cutoff (where the bottom is stone) when offering advice on the Yellow River cutoff, but rather the material-saving, labor-saving, and reliable cutoff methods created by our ancestors. It is called: "Sorghum Stalk Bundle Inward Encroachment Cutoff Method." During the cutoff, a net bottom connected by hemp ropes is laid on the rapid water surface (here, the bottom is soil), one end tied to a wooden stake at the dam head, and the other end tied to a wooden boat fixed in the turbulent current. Sorghum stalks are laid on the net bottom, and wooden stakes are inserted vertically. Then, the sorghum stalks and wooden stakes are bundled together with ropes connected to the net bottom, and soil is added upward until the layered sorghum stalk bundles are sunk to the bottom of the river. In this way, the area is gradually occupied forward, and finally the surging Yellow River is cut off. Currently, the people fighting here are consolidating the occupation of the dam head and excavating the Yellow River's new course.
    Following the ferries here to the south bank of the Yellow River is the location of the excavation of the Yellow River's new course—the diversion channel of the river-blocking gate. Ah! What a great scene this is! In a long strip ten li long and more than one li wide, 100,000 people are gathered, red flags are flying in the wind, triumphal arches are erected all over the construction site, steel shovels are flying, and wheelbarrows are weaving like ten thousand shuttles. The warriors' momentum is overwhelming. They are vowing to change the Yellow River's course here within twenty days at a rate of 300,000 cubic meters of earthwork per day. Looking from a distance, this seems like a sea of people. When you insert yourself into this torrent, you can see how well-organized their labor organization is. Each county and commune is assigned a lane, and vehicles have their own dedicated lines. The entire team of Leiji Camp in Xiajin County, which won the title of "Pioneer" for building the Dongping Lake Reservoir dam last autumn, has now proposed the slogan of "Vowing to Win the First Red Flag of the County." They are all carrying with astonishing loads and at outstanding speeds, pushing eight hundred to one thousand two hundred jin per cart, averaging eighty to one hundred and ten trips per day over a distance of five hundred meters, and each person completes twenty to twenty-five cubic meters of earthwork per day (the target is three cubic meters). These fierce generals truly deserve to be called "Shandong Heroes"! The team members of Leiji Camp also issued a challenge to the entire county on the position, and the red-letter battle report stated:
    Leiji Camp will have a thousand soldiers, heroes will make a name for themselves at Weishan,
    Leading the Yellow River by the nose, obediently irrigate the fertile fields,
    The momentum covers the entire county, the battle report is sent to each battalion and company,
    Naming two battalions, Jia Ma Camp and Xin Sheng Dian,
    Victory confidence is as strong as steel, vow to win the first red flag!
    Task:
    The earthwork task is one hundred and ten thousand, we don't need twenty days,
    Sixty-seven thousand has been completed, and there are still forty-three thousand tasks,
    Quality assurance is the first, the good news reporting time is before the 9th!
      (Referring to November 9th)
    The ambitious warriors of Leiji Camp truly completed the task on November 3rd.
    The heroes of the new era are more than just one Leiji Camp. Within a dozen days, the 100,000 brave soldiers fighting here have opened up a ten-li-long river in the flatlands!
    The river-blocking gate, straddling this diversion channel, stands majestically between Bai Mu Mountain and Huang Mountain. Its body is as high as eighteen meters, the total length is two hundred and ten meters, and the sixteen large holes face the shimmering Yellow River. The migrant workers, looking at this magnificent river-blocking gate, smiled and pointed to the Yellow River diversion gate on the north bank, talking about the grand occasion of Yellow River diversion irrigation this spring and summer. At that time, the four major trunk canals of the Weishan Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Canal ran through the territory of Liaocheng, Chiping, Xiajin, Pingyuan, Linqing, Qihe and other counties (cities). Wherever the trunk canals went, each county and commune dug several branch canals, large and small water gates, crisscrossing and connecting the ditches and fields. Once the Yellow River diversion gate was opened, the gurgling Yellow River water flowed directly to the roots of the crops, enabling 3.6 million mu of dry land to achieve self-flowing irrigation, resulting in an additional 123 million jin of grain this year. The commune members happily said: With the Weishan Water Conservancy Project, even if God doesn't rain, we can still guarantee a good harvest! No wonder each county and commune sent the strongest young people, the best vehicles, and the best grain, rice, and vegetables to the construction site during this Yellow River cutoff project. They want to complete the work and store water before the winter ice flood, relying on it to irrigate spring wheat! (Attached picture)

    山东好汉斩黄河
    本报记者　姜文品
    黄河，这条日泄千里的浊龙，进入山东境内，就要被人拦腰斩断，乖乖地听人安排了。
    山东人民，通过大跃进的增产事实，更看准了“水”的重要。在山东境内最大的水源，就是世世代代危害他们的黄河。
    黄河位山水利枢纽工程，是根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利综合规划的重要组成部分。这一工程具有防洪、防凌、灌溉、发电、航运等综合利用之效，它是黄河上主要梯级开发工程之一，也是山东的水利心脏。大跃进的1958年，经中央批准，提前一年开了工。去年秋天，二十五万人开进了工地，奋战八十天，用一千八百万土方，从平地上筑起了一道二百余里长的湖堤，建起了一个方圆六百二十八平方公里，蓄水可达四十亿立方，比驰名中外的官厅水库几乎还大一倍的东平湖水库。与此同时，又相继地将躯体巨大的拦河闸、出湖闸、引黄闸、分水闸、沉沙池等工程建筑起来，完成了位山水利枢纽第一、二期工程，获得了根治黄河的第一个胜利！今年，乘胜前进的山东人民，于10月15日又开始了迫使黄水改道为中心的第三期工程。这一期工程，要建筑起三道进湖闸、一道防沙闸、一道船闸、五座巨大的建筑物；要开挖四条全长一万七千余米的引河；要筑起一道截流的拦河大坝。全部工程的土方任务是一千四百六十余万公方，开山、砌石四十四万公方，浇灌混凝土九万余公方，秫秸七百五十万公斤。这样一个浩大的工程，要在凌汛前六十天之内，完成开挖引河和黄河截流工程，这是一个艰巨的任务。然而，人们却为一个美丽的远景所鼓舞。这期工程完成后，黄河就可以拦腰斩断了。今后如遇特大的洪峰、凌汛，即可用拦河闸把水截住，迫其通过进湖闸，注入东平湖内。在一般的流量下，可吞进黄河三十天的水流；待春冬黄河枯水季节，东平湖水库裂开出湖闸的大口，放出四千秒公方的流量，既可畅通航运，又能满足沿河四千万亩土地的灌溉用水。位山枢纽的三座电站建成后，能发出电二万五千瓩。位山枢纽工程还有一个特殊效益，它将利用东平湖水库的蓄水，复活停航六七十年的京杭大运河。富饶秀丽的东平湖水库，每年还可出产二十亿斤肥鱼。福利累累，用途广大的位山水利枢纽工程，它像一块巨大的磁石，紧紧地吸住了山东人民的心。
    走出位山工程局，顺着黄河西岸走四、五里路，就是黄河截流处。截流用料堆积成山。河槽里的大小船只，正把大批的物资器材、蔬菜粮草向这里运送过来。四只庞大的渡船装满了头裹白巾的民工、小车、行囊、炊具，“咚咚咚”的火轮不知疲倦地把人们送到对岸去。河岸上被车马人群践踏得尘土飞扬。
    在这里指导黄河截流工程的，是三十多名具有四五十年或五六十年截流经验的老河工。这是土专家。其中有位薛九令老人，今年七十八岁，他在十六岁的时候就当了河工。这些熟悉黄河水性的老人，他们在对黄河截流献策时，用的不是在三门峡截流用过的那些现代化的方法（那里是石底），而是用我们祖先创造的省料、省力、而又可靠的截流方法。名曰：秸埽进占截流法”。截流时，把用?绳联结的网底铺在湍急的水面上，（这里是土底）一端系于坝头的木桩，一端系于被固定在湍流中的木船上，向网底上铺设秫秸、竖插木桩，然后用联在网底的绳索将秫秸、木桩捆起，向上加土，直到把分层做的秸埽沉入河底为止。这样逐段向前占有，最后就把澎湃的黄河截断了。现时战斗在这里的人们，正在巩固地占有坝头，开挖引河黄河新道。
    随着这里的渡船来到黄河南岸，就是开挖黄河新道——拦河闸的引河所在。呀！这是一个多么伟大的场面啊！在十里之遥，一里余宽的长带上，云集了十万人，红旗迎风飘扬，凯旋门群立工地，钢锹在飞舞，手推车像万梭交织。勇士们气势盖天，他们以每天挖运三十万土方的速度，立誓要在二十天之内，要黄河在这里改道。远远望去，这里好像是一片人海。当你插进这条洪流之中，就可看到他们的劳动组织搞得是那么有条有理。县、社各分一溜，车辆来去各有专线。工地上去秋修建东平湖水库大堤曾荣获“先锋”称号的夏津县雷集营的全体队员，现在又提出了“誓夺全县第一面红旗”的口号。他们都以惊人的戴重，超群的速度，每车推八百至一千二百斤，平均在五百米的运距上，日达八十至一百一十趟，每人完成日运二十至二十五立方土（指标是三立方）。这些猛将，真不愧为“山东好汉”！雷集营的队员在阵地上又向全县发出了挑战书，红字战表上写道：
    雷集大营将千员，英雄扬名留位山，
    牵着黄河鼻子走，俯首贴耳灌良田，
    声势浩大盖全县，战表下到各营连，
    指名点将两个营，甲马营和新盛店，
    胜利信心坚如钢，誓夺红旗第一面！
    任务：
    土方任务十一万，我们不用二十天，
    已完成的六万七，还有任务四万三，
    质量保证拔第一，报捷时间九号前！
      （指十一月九号）
    雄心勃勃的雷集营的勇士们，果真在11月3日，就完成了任务。
    新时代的英雄何止一个雷集营，奋战在这里的十万雄兵，十几日之内，就在一马平川，豁开了十里长河！
    横跨在这条引河当间的拦河闸，巍峨地屹立在柏木山与黄山之间。它的躯体高达十八米，全长二百一十米，十六个大孔，朝向银光闪闪的黄河。民工们望着这座雄伟的拦河闸，笑逐颜开地又指着黄河北岸的引黄闸，高谈起今年春夏引黄灌溉的盛况。那时位山引黄灌溉渠的四大干渠，贯串在聊城、茌平、夏津、平原、临清、齐河等县（市）境内，干渠所到之处，各县、社开挖了若干支渠，大小水闸，纵横交错，沟畦相联。引黄闸一开，淙淙的黄水一直流到庄稼根下，使三百六十万亩旱田实现了自流灌溉，使今年的庄稼多收了一亿两千三百多斤粮食，社员们高兴地说：有了位山水利工程，老天滴雨不下，也能保丰收啦！无怪乎各县社在这次黄河截流工程中，都把最强的青壮年、最优等的车辆、最好的粮米蔬菜送到工地上来。他们要争取在今冬凌期前完工蓄水，靠它浇灌春麦！（附图片）
