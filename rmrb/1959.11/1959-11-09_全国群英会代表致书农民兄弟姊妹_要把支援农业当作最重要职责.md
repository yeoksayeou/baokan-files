Letter to Farmer Brothers and Sisters from Representatives of the National Congress of Heroes
To Regard Supporting Agriculture as the Most Important Responsibility

Dear farmer brothers and sisters:

Hello! We, representing all workers in the fields of industry, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade across the country, extend our warmest greetings and highest respect to you with the most heartfelt feelings.

Dear brothers and sisters, a little over a year ago, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, you realized the people's commune system. This is a remarkable event. This is a concentrated expression of your firm will and determination to take the socialist road, a continuation and development of the socialist revolution in our country's rural areas, and a great initiative of our people under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the great leader Chairman Mao. The people's commune, this sun rising in the East of Asia, is radiating increasingly powerful light and heat. The people's commune is the best organizational form under the conditions of our country to rapidly develop the rural economy and culture, and to gradually transition the countryside from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, and from socialism to communism. Relying on the superiority of this organizational form of the people's commune, you have brought into play infinite wisdom and strength, resisted floods, droughts, insect pests, and wind disasters, and repeatedly increased the production of grain, cotton, and other crops. You have also started industries, and in the countryside, the rumble of machines has sounded, and electric lights have lit up. You have set up public canteens, homes for the elderly, and nurseries. Your lives are also getting better and better. It is truly said: "The benefits of the commune are endless, and the power of the commune is boundless." It cannot be blown down by the wind or scattered by thunder, and anyone who wants to dismantle it is daydreaming. We are increasingly clearly seeing: the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are the broad road to eternal happiness pointed out to us by Chairman Mao.

In the great Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement, you have not only supplied more raw materials for industrial production, guaranteed the grain, cotton, and other agricultural products needed by the country, but also directly participated in and supported industrial construction. We will never forget your tens of millions of people going up the mountains to explore treasures and making steel on a large scale, thereby promoting the leap-forward development of the steel industry; we will never forget your millions of people engaging in short-distance transportation on a large scale, building railways and running postal and telecommunications to support the spirit of communist cooperation in industry and transportation; we will never forget the soaring revolutionary drive with which you made high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way. It is precisely with your support that we in the industrial, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade fronts have been given favorable conditions to achieve a Great Leap Forward. The creations of each of our advanced collectives and advanced producers, our achievements, are inseparable from your hard work and your great help.

The Party and Chairman Mao have taught us to vigorously support agriculture. Dear brothers and sisters, we must follow this teaching. We fully understand that to transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country, we must accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture, gradually mechanize, irrigate, chemify, and electrify agriculture, so that agricultural production will increase many times over. Only with a great development of agricultural production can industry have more raw materials, can the speed of industrial development be accelerated, and can our people across the country live a more prosperous and happy life. Now our country has laid the initial foundation for socialist industrialization, and we already have people's communes. We have all the conditions to gradually realize the technological transformation of agriculture. In the past, we have produced a lot of irrigation and drainage machinery, cultivation machinery, harvesting machinery, power generation equipment, and chemical fertilizers for you. In the future, we will also manufacture more agricultural machinery and equipment, more chemical fertilizers, realize the technological transformation of agriculture as soon as possible, and greatly advance the realization of the twelve-year development program for agriculture. We must regard supporting agriculture and supporting the people's commune as our most important responsibility.

Dear brothers and sisters, as the saying goes, "When everyone is of one mind, yellow earth can be turned into gold." The workers and peasants of China have always been brothers. In the past, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we formed a united heart and a consolidated alliance, which overthrew the three mountains of feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism that were pressing down on us, and then carried out the socialist revolution and began socialist construction. In the future, we must also unite more closely and more firmly under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, hand in hand, heart to heart, to create a common happy life for us and our descendants, to build our country into great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

Let us shout:

Long live the General Line! Long live the Great Leap Forward! Long live the People's Commune!

Long live the worker-peasant alliance!

Long live the great, correct, and glorious Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Chairman

    全国群英会代表致书农民兄弟姊妹
    要把支援农业当作最重要职责亲爱的农民兄弟姊妹们：
    你们好！我们代表全国工业、交通运输、基本建设和财贸方面全体职工，以最亲切的心情，向你们致以最热烈的慰问和最崇高的敬意。
    亲爱的兄弟姊妹们，一年多以前，你们在共产党和毛主席领导下，实现了人民公社化。这是一件了不起的大事。这是你们坚定地走社会主义道路的伟大意志和决心的集中表现，是我国农村社会主义革命的继续和发展，是我国人民在党中央和伟大领袖毛主席领导下的伟大创举。人民公社，这个在亚洲东方升起的太阳，正在散发出愈来愈强大的光和热。人民公社是在我国条件下，迅速地发展农村经济和文化，并且使农村逐步地从集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，从社会主义过渡到共产主义的最好的组织形式。你们依靠人民公社这一组织形式的优越性，发挥了无穷的智慧和力量，抗拒了洪涝、干旱、虫害和风灾，使粮食、棉花及其他农作物都一再增产。你们还办起了工业，在农村中，响起了隆隆的机器声，亮起了电灯。你们办起了公共食堂、敬老院、托儿所。你们的生活也越过越美好了。这真是：“公社的好处说不完，公社的力量大无边。”风吹不垮，雷打不散，任何人要拆散它，都是妄想。我们越来越清楚地看到：总路线、大跃进、人民公社就是毛主席给我们指出的一条走向万年幸福的康庄大道。
    在伟大的大跃进和人民公社化运动中，你们不但供给了工业生产更多的原料，保证了国家所需要的粮食、棉花和其他农产品，而且，你们还直接参加了和支援了工业建设。我们永远不能忘记你们几千万人上山探宝、大炼钢铁从而促进了钢铁工业飞跃发展的壮举；我们永远不能忘记你们千百万人大搞短途运输、大修铁路、大办邮电支援工业、交通运输的共产主义协作精神；我们永远不能忘记，你们叫高山低头，叫河水让路的冲天革命干劲。正是在你们支援下，才给了我们工业、交通运输、基本建设和财贸各个战线实现大跃进的有利条件。我们每个先进集体、先进生产者的创造，我们的成就，都是和你们的辛勤劳动、和你们的伟大帮助分不开的。
    党和毛主席教导我们要大力支援农业。亲爱的兄弟姊妹们，我们一定遵循这个教导。我们完全懂得，要把我国从落后的农业国变成社会主义的先进的工业国，就要加速农业技术改造，逐步使农业机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化，使农业生产成倍成倍地增长，有了农业生产的大发展才能使工业有更多的原料，才能加快工业发展的速度，也才能使我们全国人民过更加富裕幸福的生活。现在我国已经奠定了社会主义工业化的初步基础，已经有了人民公社，我们有一切条件来逐步实现农业的技术改造。过去，我们已经为你们生产了不少排灌机械、耕种机械、收割机械、发电设备和化学肥料。今后我们还要制造更多的农业机械设备，更多的化学肥料，尽快地实现农业技术改造，大大提前实现农业十二年发展纲要。我们一定要把支援农业、支援人民公社当作自己最重要的职责。
    亲爱的兄弟姊妹们，俗话说得好，“大家一条心，黄土变成金。”中国的工人和农民从来就是弟兄，过去在党和毛主席的领导下，我们结成一条心，结成巩固的联盟，才推翻了压在我们身上的封建主义、帝国主义和官僚资本主义三座大山，紧接着进行了社会主义革命和开始了社会主义建设。今后，我们也一定要在党和毛主席领导下更加亲密、更加巩固地团结在一起，手拉手，心连心，创造我们和我们万代子孙的共同的幸福生活，把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。
    让我们高呼：
    总路线万岁！大跃进万岁！人民公社万岁！
    工农联盟万岁！
    伟大、正确、光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    我国各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会全体代表
                                            1959年11月8日
