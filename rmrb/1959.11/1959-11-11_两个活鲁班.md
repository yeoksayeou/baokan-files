Two “Living Lubans”

Liu Zhicheng of the Qinghai Construction Company's Lumber Mill and Zhang Jun of the Guizhou Automobile Parts Factory are both woodworking innovation experts. At the National Heroes Conference, everyone called them "two living Lubans."

Liu Zhicheng successfully created a planing machine in 1954. After participating in the National Advanced Producers Conference of the Construction Industry in 1956, he spent one year and three months of painstaking research and successfully created China's first combined door and window machine. This allowed for nine processes of door and window making to be carried out continuously and automatically: put wood in one side, and finished products come out the other. Over the past few years, he has created and imitated a total of nineteen important machines. Under his leadership, many employees have actively innovated technology, enabling the entire factory to realize mechanization of manual operations.

Since Zhang Jun first made a wood planer in 1950, he has successively created nineteen important machines, such as crane saws and large band saws.

At the National Heroes Conference, they enthusiastically exchanged experiences.

    两个活鲁班
    青海建筑公司制材厂的刘志诚和贵州汽车配件厂的张俊，都是木工革新能手。全国群英大会上，大家称他们“两个活鲁班”。
    刘志诚1954年创制成功了刨料机。1956年参加全国建筑业先进生产者会议以后，经过一年零三个月的苦心钻研，他又创制成功了我国第一台联合门窗机，使制作门窗的九道工序能连续自动进行，这边放进去木头，那边就出成品。几年来，他一共创造和仿制了十九种重要机具，在他的带动下，许多职工都积极革新技术，使全厂手工操作实现了机械化。
    张俊从1950年首制刨木机以后，先后创制成功了吊机锯、大壅带锯等十九种重要机具。
    在全国群英大会上，他们热情地交流了经验。
