Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th: Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, all government offices, factories, shops, schools, and residents are actively developing pig production. By the end of October, more than 90% of collective units in the city had raised pigs, with a total inventory of more than 7,500 heads. Now, many units have basically achieved "self-sufficiency in meat during festivals and increased supply during normal times."

The Wuxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in leading pig production, earnestly implemented the policy of "local production, local supply, self-reliance," with both the city and countryside working together. All levels established specialized organizations to provide specific leadership. At the same time, they promptly held on-site meetings to promote advanced experiences and organize competitions, greatly enhancing the enthusiasm of various units for pig raising.

Keeping "action" in mind, focusing on "poverty," and starting with "skill," launching a mass movement is the main characteristic of Wuxi City's development of pig production. Various government offices, enterprises, schools, and residents have tried every possible means to overcome the difficulties of breeding conditions. They made use of all available waste and old materials to build pigsties. All units fully utilized scraps, planting, and collecting various green fodder to reduce the supply of national commercial feed. Pig management personnel are generally concurrently held by cooks, and the Municipal Non-Staple Food Headquarters also assisted in training two batches of part-time breeders.

In developing pig production, the principle of "self-breeding and self-raising" was resolutely implemented. In addition to the three districts and the grain departments establishing piglet breeding farms, the Municipal Non-Staple Food Headquarters also actively allocated a batch of high-quality pig breeds to various units for self-breeding. At present, the city has more than 700 sows, and nearly 3,000 piglets have been bred.

    城市农村齐动手
    无锡生猪繁殖多
    据新华社南京10日电　江苏无锡市各机关、工厂、商店、学校和居民积极发展养猪生产。到10月底，全市已有90％以上的集体单位饲养了生猪，圈存数达七千五百多头。现在许多单位基本上做到吃肉“节日自给，平时增加”。
    中共无锡市委在领导养猪生产中，认真贯彻“就地生产，就地供应，自力更生”的方针，城市农村一起抓。各级都成立了专门机构具体领导，同时，及时召开现场会议，推广先进经验，组织竞赛，大大提高了各单位养猪积极性。
    “干”字当头，“穷”字着眼，“巧”字着手，大搞群众运动，是无锡市发展养猪生产中的主要特色。各机关、企业、学校和居民千方百计克服饲养条件的困难。他们因陋就简，利用一切废旧材料盖猪舍。各单位充分利用下脚或种植和收集各种青饲料，减少国家商品饲料的供应。养猪管理人员一般都由炊事员兼任，市副食品指挥部还协助训练了两批兼职饲养员。
    在发展生猪生产中，坚决贯彻了“自繁自养”的方针。全市除了三个区和粮食部门建立仔猪繁殖场以外，市副食品指挥部还积极调拨了一批优良猪种给各单位自行繁殖。现在，全市已有母猪七百多头，已繁殖仔猪近三千多头。
