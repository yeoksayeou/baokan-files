    Counterattack the Barbaric Acts of the United States in Violating Sovereignty
    Anti-American Demonstrations Continue to Erupt in Panama
    Xinhua News Agency, Panama City, 5th: Following the passionate mass demonstrations on Panama's Independence Day, November 3rd, the people of Panama City held another anti-American demonstration on the 4th, protesting the American violation of Panama's sovereignty. Demonstrators threw stones at the offices of the American-owned Electric Light and Power Company on Central Avenue in Panama City.
    Panamanian Foreign Minister Miguel Moreno submitted a protest to U.S. Ambassador Harrington on the same day, pointing out that U.S. personnel had rudely torn down the Panamanian flag in the Canal Zone before the Panamanian people tore down the U.S. flag in front of the U.S. Embassy on the 3rd. The protest also denounced the American police and American troops in the Panama Canal Zone for taking crude measures to beat Panamanian people who attempted to enter the Canal Zone. He said that four Panamanians were injured due to the actions of the American military personnel.
    After the Panamanian people held anti-American demonstrations on the 3rd, Harrington, on behalf of the U.S. government, issued a so-called "protest" note to the Panamanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, threatening that such demonstrations "seriously endanger" U.S. relations with Panama.

    反击美国侵犯主权的蛮横行径
    巴拿马继续爆发反美示威
    新华社5日讯　巴拿马城消息：继11月3日巴拿马独立日情绪激昂的群众示威游行之后，巴拿马首都人民4日再次举行反美示威，抗议美国佬对巴拿马主权的侵犯。示威群众用石块投掷巴拿马中央大街上的美商电灯和电力公司办事处。
    巴拿马外交部长米格尔·莫雷诺同一天向美国大使哈林顿提交了一分抗议书，指出在3日巴拿马人民在美国大使馆门前扯下美国国旗之前美方人员曾经无礼地撕毁了运河区的巴拿马国旗。抗议书还斥责巴拿马运河区的美国警察和美国军队采取粗暴的手段殴打企图进入运河区的巴拿马群众。他说，由于美国军事人员的这种行动，有四名巴拿马人受伤。
    在3日巴拿马人民举行反美示威游行以后，哈林顿曾经代表美国政府向巴拿马外交部提出所谓“抗议”照会，威胁说这种示威“严重危及”美国同巴拿马的关系。
