    The American Ambassador and His Dog
    Poem by Chi Bei’ou, Drawing by Ying Tao
    Whenever you see the ambassador,
    You're sure to see the ambassador's dog,
    No matter what gathering, parade, or meeting,
    He and it are always showing off.
    You solemnly celebrate Independence Day,
    He doesn't take it seriously at all,
    Why not take his beloved dog for a stroll,
    To let it relax and digest.
    The Lebanese public is greatly indignant,
    But the ambassador doesn't think he's gone too far.
    In their country,
    The dogs of the rich are nobler than people,
    And Americans have always considered themselves masters in other people's countries. (Attached image)

    美国大使和狗
    池北偶诗　英韬画
    看到大使的时候，
    一定看到大使的狗，
    不管你什么集会、阅兵、会，
    总少不了他和它出头。
    你隆重庆祝独立日，
    他根本不当一回事，
    何妨带着爱犬蹓个弯，
    好让它散散心、消消食。
    黎巴嫩的公众大为激忿，
    大使老爷却不觉得做得过份。
    在他们的国家，
    阔人的狗比人高贵，
    而美国佬一直认为自己在别人国家里是主人。（附图片）
