Plant protection and pest control are important components of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." Only when plant protection work is done well can the effects of soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, close planting, tools, and management be fully realized, ensuring a reliable harvest. Precisely because of this, our Party and state attach great importance to this work. The state has established special leadership and scientific research institutions for pest control, trained a large number of specialized pest control personnel, produced a large number of pest control machines and a large amount of chemical pesticides, and sent large numbers of aircraft to control pests and diseases over large areas, and so on. In recent years, great achievements have been made in plant protection and pest control: the area of pest control nationwide has expanded from more than 100 million mu in 1950 to more than 1.8 billion mu in 1958, and more than 700 counties and cities have basically eliminated one or several major diseases or pests. We have been able to effectively control locusts, which used to be a serious threat; the loss rate from rice borers in the southern rice-growing areas has decreased from 10% before liberation to about 2%; and the incidence of wheat smut has decreased from 10%-15% to less than 1%. This year, due to the unprecedented drought, pest and disease disasters have been very serious. Rice blast in early rice, rice borers in mid- and late-season rice, cotton bollworms and pink bollworms in cotton, as well as migratory locusts, red spiders, and corn borers, have successively caused damage. However, the people's communes and the vast number of commune members, using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, with aircraft, chemical pesticides, and local pesticides and methods all mobilized, finally overcame the serious pest and disease disasters and ensured a bumper harvest in agricultural production.

However, to completely eliminate crop pests and diseases requires a longer period of struggle, because pests and diseases have a strong ability to reproduce and multiply, making it impossible to eliminate them completely in a short period of time. In particular, this year the area of farmland nationwide that suffered from pests and diseases was large, and the quantity was high. Although vigorous prevention and control measures were taken, there are still many residual germs, insect eggs, and larvae. According to a survey in Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, one infested corn stalk contains seven to ten corn borer larvae, and in some severe cases, dozens. According to a survey in Shandong Province, the number of overwintering pink bollworm larvae in some cotton-growing areas is two to four times higher than last year; and wheat rust has already begun to be found in early-sown wheat in some areas of North and Northwest China. All of these situations indicate that we must not have any slightest relaxation or slackness in our efforts to prevent and control pests and diseases, and we must seize favorable opportunities to carry out repeated and tenacious prevention and control.

Winter is a favorable time to control pests and diseases. Most kinds of germs, spores, insect eggs, and larvae hide in the soil, weeds, stalks, stubble, rachises, and seeds to overwinter. Overwintering larvae generally do not eat or move, and their hibernation period can last as long as four or five months (from October and November this year to February and March next year). This is the easiest time to eliminate them. At the same time, eliminating one insect egg or larva now is equivalent to eliminating dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of pests during the growing season. Eliminating pests in one mu of land now can guarantee that dozens or even hundreds of mu of crops will be unaffected or less affected during the growing season. Seizing this opportunity to organize manpower to control pests and diseases is not only effective and saves manpower and resources, but also takes the initiative in plant protection work. Conversely, by next year, one germ, insect egg, or larva will have multiplied into thousands or tens of thousands, and the pests and diseases in one mu of land will have spread to dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of mu. Eliminating them at that time will require even more manpower and resources, and crops will suffer losses to varying degrees. Therefore, eliminating overwintering germs, insect eggs, and larvae is the most important part of prevention and control work. Grasping this link can achieve a "twice the result with half the effort" effect. The broad masses have a very clear understanding of the importance of winter pest control from their own personal experiences. They say, "Control one worm in winter, harvest ten thousand grains in autumn." Therefore, the masses in many places have put forward the slogan of "Don't let pests and diseases overwinter," and have actively carried out various pest control activities in close combination with water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and field management.

However, a small number of people still have right-leaning conservative ideas about winter pest control work. They believe that "the effect is not great, and it is not worth the effort"; "winter production is so busy, where is there time to control pests"; or "pests and diseases do not cause harm in winter, and it is not too late to control them in the spring." In fact, winter control is not ineffective, but very effective; it is not a waste of effort, but a multi-win situation. In the past, wheat in Gansu Province suffered from damage from wheat bugs, with an infestation rate as high as 30%. In 1957, the masses used methods such as "digging, shoveling, and burning" to eliminate 99.6% of the wheat bugs overwintering on weeds such as needlegrass, and in 1958, the infestation rate dropped to 0.44%. In order to eliminate overwintering corn borers, the Jin Southeast Prefecture of Shanxi Province comprehensively treated various insect-infested stalks, rachises, and stubble, which not only eliminated pests, but also accumulated 27.7 billion jin of compost, produced 500 million jin of forage grass, 100 million jin of pig feed, and accumulated more than 300 million jin of firewood, while also beautifying the environment. Therefore, we must not have any complacency or wishful thinking about pests and diseases, and we must strive for initiative and strive to be the best in our work, trying to eliminate germs, insect eggs, and larvae as early and thoroughly as possible. As for the fact that there are many tasks and we are too busy, that can also be resolved. Because winter pest control work can be completely combined with winter production. For example, combining with fertilizer accumulation can eliminate germs, insect eggs, and larvae lurking in stubble, weeds, dead branches, and fallen leaves; combining with plowing and irrigation can treat germs, insect eggs, and larvae on stubble; combining with storing livestock feed can eliminate germs, insect eggs, and larvae on corn, millet, and sorghum stalks and rachises; combining with repairing canals and eliminating wasteland can treat germs, insect eggs, and larvae on weeds; combining with developing sideline production can capture and kill harmful birds and animals; combining with cleaning cotton warehouses can eliminate overwintering pink bollworm larvae; and combining with sanitation work can clear germs, insect eggs, and larvae on weeds, dead branches, and residual plants. The work of preventing and controlling overwintering pests and diseases is not only not contradictory to winter agricultural production work, but can also promote and influence each other.

There are many ways to eliminate overwintering pests and diseases, and different methods should be adopted according to the different locations where pests and diseases are lurking: for those lurking in plant stalks and rachises, methods such as chopping, grinding, sealing, and burning can be adopted; for those lurking in stubble and weeds, methods such as burning and composting can be adopted; for those lurking in the soil, methods such as watering and deep plowing can be adopted; for those lurking in seeds, methods such as scalding, mixing (with pesticides), and freezing can be adopted; and for those lurking in grain, methods such as sweeping and spraying (with pesticides) can be adopted. Whether in the south or the north, whether for rice, wheat, or cotton, as long as different measures are taken to eliminate overwintering pests and diseases in winter according to different conditions, good results can be achieved. However, due to current limitations, it is impossible to eliminate pests and diseases completely in winter, and we must also set up defenses step by step and eliminate them period by period according to the three stages of pest and disease occurrence: overwintering period, initial outbreak period, and peak outbreak period. Only by doing a more thorough job in the overwintering period will there be fewer occurrences in early spring. If we then add prevention and control measures at this time, we can reduce the number in the peak outbreak period. If we then encircle and suppress them during the peak outbreak period, we can completely control the harm caused by pests and diseases and prevent them from becoming a disaster. Therefore, all localities should still seize this crucial period in winter, organize a certain number of full and half-time laborers and auxiliary laborers, and devote themselves to the battle of preventing and controlling pests and diseases.

To do a good job in this winter's pest control work, Party committees at all levels must strengthen political and ideological work and organizational work, and the original pest control headquarters in various localities should continue to be responsible for leading winter control; extensively and deeply mobilize the masses to achieve "everyone takes action, everyone eliminates pests." At the same time, we must widely publicize the scientific basis, methods, and benefits of winter pest control; and set up demonstration points in various places to set an example for everyone to visit and learn from. Only in this way is it possible to do a better job in this winter's pest control work and ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture next year.

    消灭越冬病虫害  保卫明年大丰收
    植物保护、防治病虫害，是农业“八字宪法”中的一个重要项目。植物保护工作做得好，土、肥、水、种、密、工、管的作用才能充分体现出来，丰收才有可靠的保证。正是因为如此，我们党和国家非常重视这一工作，国家为防治病虫害专门设置了领导机构和科学研究机构，培养了大批具有专门知识的防治工作人员，生产了大批除虫机械和大量的化学农药，还派出了大批飞机在大面积上防治病虫害，等等。几年来，保护植物的防治病虫害工作取得了巨大成就：全国防治病虫害的面积，已经从1950年的一亿多亩扩大到1958年的十八亿多亩，并且已有七百多个县、市基本上消灭了一种或几种主要病害或虫害。对于过去为害严重的蝗虫，已经能够有效的控制；南方稻区螟虫为害的损失率已经从解放前的10％下降到2％左右；麦黑穗病的发病率已经从10％—15％下降到不到1％。今年，由于出现了几十年来未有的干旱现象，病虫灾害十分严重。早稻的稻瘟病、中晚稻的螟虫、棉花的红铃虫、棉铃虫，以及飞蝗、红蜘蛛、玉米螟等病虫，都曾相继为害。但是，各地人民公社和广大社员，在“土洋结合”，飞机、化学药械和土农药、土办法一齐出动，终于战胜了严重的病虫灾害，保证了农业生产的丰收。
    但是，要彻底消灭农作物的病虫害，需要作较长时期的斗争。因为病虫害繁衍孳生的能力很强，一时不可能扑灭干净。特别是今年全国农田遭受病虫害的面积广、数量多，虽然经过大力防治，残留的病菌和虫卵、幼虫还是不少。据河南新乡专区调查，一株受害的玉米秸内有玉米螟幼虫七至十条，个别严重的有几十条。又据山东省的调查材料：有些棉区越冬的红铃虫幼虫，比去年多二至四倍；在华北和西北部分地区早播的小麦，已经开始发现小麦锈病。这些情况都说明：对于防治病虫害的工作，决不能有丝毫麻痹松劲情绪，必须抓住有利时机，反复顽强地进行防治。
    冬季正是防治病虫害的有利时期，各种病菌、孢子、虫卵、幼虫等一到冬季，大多数都躲藏在土壤、杂草、秸秆、根茬、穗轴、种子里面过冬。越冬幼虫一般不食不动，冬眠时间有的长达四五个月（从今年10、11月到明年2、3月），在这个时期，最容易消灭。同时，现在消灭一个虫卵和幼虫就等于作物生长期间消灭几十、几百甚至几万个害虫。现在在一亩地内除了害虫，就能保证生长期间几十亩甚至几百亩农作物不受害或者少受害。抓住这个时机组织人力防治病虫害，不但效果好，节省人力物力；而且在植物保护工作上打了一个主动仗。反之，到明年一个病菌或虫卵、幼虫，就会繁殖到成千上万个，一亩地的病虫害，就会扩大到几十亩几百亩以至几千亩，那时消灭它们便要花费更大的人力和物力，而且作物还会遭受不同程度的损失。由此可见，消灭越冬病菌、虫卵、幼虫是防治工作中的最重要的一环，抓住这个环节，就能够收到“事半功倍”的效果。广大群众从自己的切身体验中，对于冬季治虫的重要性认识得很清楚，他们说，“冬治一条虫，秋收万粒谷”。因此，许多地方的群众已经提出“不让病虫害过冬”的口号，密切结合兴修水利、积肥、田间管理等项工作，积极开展了各种防治病虫害的活动。
    但是，有一小部分人对冬季防治病虫害的工作还存在着右倾保守思想，他们认为“效果不大，得不偿失”；“冬季生产这样忙，哪有工夫治虫”；或者是“冬季病虫不为害，来年春天防治也不晚”。事实上，冬季防治不是效果不好，而是效果很好；不是得不偿失，而是一举数得。甘肃省的小麦过去遭受麦椿象为害，受害率高达30％，1957年群众用“挖、铲、烧”等办法，消灭了在芨芨草等杂草上过冬的麦椿象99.6％以后，1958年为害率就下降到0.44％。山西省晋东南专区为了消灭过冬的玉米螟，全面处理了各种有虫的秸秆、穗轴和根茬等，不但消灭了虫害，而且还积了堆肥二百七十七亿斤，制造饲草五亿斤、猪饲料一亿斤，积下烧柴三亿多斤，并且还美化了环境。因此，对于病虫害，丝毫不能有麻痹思想和侥幸心理，必须在工作中争主动，争上游，尽量把工作往前赶，把病菌、虫卵、幼虫消灭得愈早愈好，愈彻底愈好。至于说到各项工作任务多，忙不过来，那也是可以解决的。因为冬季防治病虫害的工作完全可以和冬季生产结合进行。比如结合积肥，就能消灭潜伏在根茬、杂草、枯枝、落叶上的病菌、虫卵、幼虫；结合耕地灌水，能够处理根茬上的病菌、虫卵、幼虫；结合贮备牲畜饲料，可以消灭玉米、谷子、高粱的秸秆和穗轴上的病菌、虫卵、幼虫；结合整修水渠和消灭夹荒地，可以处理杂草上的病菌、虫卵、幼虫；结合开展副业生产，捕打害鸟害兽；结合清理棉花仓库，消灭过冬红铃虫幼虫；结合卫生工作，可以清除杂草、枯枝、残株上的病菌、虫卵、幼虫等等。防治越冬病虫害的工作，不但和冬季农业生产工作没有矛盾，而且可以互相推动，互相影响。
    消灭越冬病虫的方法是很多的，应当根据病虫潜伏的地点不同，采取不同的消灭方法：对潜伏在植物秸秆、穗轴里面的，可以采取铡、磨、封、烧的办法；对潜伏在根茬、杂草内的，可以采取烧、沤的办法；对潜伏在土壤里的，可以采取水灌、深翻的办法；对潜伏在种子里的，可以采取烫、拌（拌药）、冻的办法；对潜伏在粮食内的，可以采取扫、喷（喷药）的办法。不论是南方、北方，不论是稻、麦、棉花，只要在冬季针对不同情况，采取不同的措施消灭越冬的病虫害，都可以收到良好的效果。不过，目前由于条件的限制，不可能在冬季就把病虫害消灭得一干二净，还必须根据病虫发生规律的三个阶段：越冬期、初发期、盛发期，步步设防，期期除治。只是越冬期搞得越彻底，早春发生数量就少，这时再加以防治，就可以减少盛发期的数量，盛发期再加以围剿，就完全可以控制病虫的危害不使成灾。所以，各地还是应该抓住冬季这个关键时期，组织一定数量的整半劳动力和辅助劳动力，一齐投入防治病虫害的战斗。
    要做好今冬的防治病虫工作，必须各级党委加强政治思想工作和组织工作，各地原有的除虫指挥部要继续负责领导冬季防治；广泛地深入地发动群众，做到“人人动手，个个除虫”。同时，要广泛宣传冬季防治病虫的科学根据、方法和好处；在各地设立示范点，做出榜样，供大家参观学习。这样，才有可能把今冬的防治病虫害工作做得更好，保证明年的农业丰收。
