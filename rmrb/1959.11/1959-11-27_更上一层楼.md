    Reaching a Higher Level
    Xu Wen
    Agricultural high schools in Jiangsu Province have emerged in response to the great leap forward in agricultural production and the increasingly successful operation of agricultural junior high schools. The establishment of agricultural high schools marks a new stage in the development of agricultural secondary education.
    With the continuous reform of agricultural technology, people's communes increasingly need more intermediate technical personnel, and therefore naturally demand the addition of senior high school classes to the existing agricultural junior high schools, so as to better cultivate more intermediate technical personnel according to the needs of local agricultural production. The establishment of agricultural high schools also reflects the urgent demands of agricultural junior high school students and their parents. Many parents are satisfied that their children can learn cultural and scientific knowledge and production skills in agricultural middle schools, and eagerly hope that they will have the opportunity to further their studies. Therefore, the establishment of agricultural high schools has been warmly supported by the masses. Many commune members are vying to send their children to agricultural high schools, and the planned classes are quickly filled.
    Agricultural high school classes are a good way to solve the problem of junior high school graduates who cannot continue their studies and to train intermediate agricultural technical personnel for the communes. This year, Jiangsu Province has 119,800 junior high school graduates, of whom more than 80,000 have been admitted to full-time senior high schools and secondary normal and technical schools, and more than 30,000 junior high school graduates cannot continue their studies. The establishment of agricultural high schools and urban vocational high schools can meet the enrollment requirements of these junior high school graduates. Agricultural high schools also adopt a half-work, half-study teaching system, implementing the educational policy of combining education with productive labor. Teaching is closely integrated with production practice, and the teaching of theoretical knowledge is closely integrated with practical application. The professional knowledge they learn is adapted to the needs of the rapid development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in the people's communes. After graduation, in addition to a few people continuing their studies, most of them can serve as intermediate technicians and cadres of the communes and teams. Agricultural high schools are schools established under the leadership of the Party and with the collective support of the members of the people's communes. Like agricultural junior high schools, they gradually achieve self-sufficiency in teachers' salaries, teaching expenses, and students' study and living expenses through productive labor. Calculated according to full-time senior high school students, the state spends 240 yuan per person per year on basic construction costs and 123 yuan on recurring expenses. If agricultural high schools are established on a large scale, they can greatly save state education expenditures and accelerate the development of China's education, while also reducing the economic burden on students' parents.
    Agricultural high schools are still new seedlings in China's education garden. From a national perspective, although agricultural high schools are not yet numerous, and some high schools still have certain difficulties temporarily, their emergence meets objective needs and they already have certain conditions, so they have unlimited vitality. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee has attached great importance and support to this seedling since it first showed the brilliance of life. It can be believed that in the future, with the support and care of Party committees at all levels, it will surely grow healthily and rapidly.

    江苏省的农业高中，在农业生产大跃进和农业初中越办越好的情况下，应运而生了。农业高中的兴办，标志着农业中学的发展跨入一个新的阶段。
    随着农业技术的不断改革，人民公社越来越需要更多的中级技术人材，因而很自然的要求在现有的农业初中的基础上，再增设高中班，以便能更好地根据当地农业生产的需要，培养更多的中级技术人材。农业高中的兴办，还反映了农业初中学生和学生家长的迫切要求。许多学生家长对自己的子女能够在农业中学学习文化科学知识和生产技术感到满意，并迫切希望他们能有机会进一步深造。因而农业高中的兴办，得到了广大群众的热烈支持。许多社员都争着把自己的子女送到农业高中来，预定的班级很快就满额了。
    农业高中班，是解决不能升学的初中毕业生继续学习和为公社培养中级农业技术人才的好方法。江苏省今年有初中毕业生十一万九千八百人，其中八万多人考进了全日制的高中和中级师范、中等技术学校，还有三万多个初中毕业生不能升学。农业高中和城市职业高中的兴办，就可以满足这些初中毕业生的升学要求。农业高中也采用半工半读的教学制度，贯彻执行了教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针，教学密切结合生产实际，讲授理论知识和实际应用紧密结合。他们所学的专业知识都是适应人民公社迅速发展农林牧副渔生产的需要。他们毕业后，除少数人继续深造外，大多数人都可充任公社的中级技术员和社队的干部。农业高中是在党的领导下，由人民公社社员集体支持兴办的学校。它和农业初中一样，通过生产劳动，逐步实现教师工资、教学费用和学生的学习和生活费用的自给。按照全日制高中学生计算，每人每年国家支出基本建设费用二百四十元，经常费用一百二十三元，农业高中如果大量兴办，就可以大大节省国家教育费用的开支，加快我国教育事业的发展，同时也减轻了学生家长的经济负担。
    农业高中，现在还是我国教育园地里的新生的幼苗。从全国来说，农业高中虽然为数还不多，有的高中暂时也还有一定的困难。但是由于它的出现符合了客观的需要，而且已经具备了一定的条件，因此它就有无限的生命力。江苏省委在这枝幼苗刚显示生命的光辉的时候，就给予了极大的重视和支持，可以相信，今后它在各级党委的扶持和关怀下，一定会健康地迅速成长起来。
