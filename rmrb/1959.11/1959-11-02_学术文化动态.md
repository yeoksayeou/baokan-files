Paleontological Expedition
Discovers a Large Number of Animal Fossils

The “Central Asia Paleontological Expedition,” jointly organized by Chinese and Soviet paleontologists, conducted a route exploration of more than 8,000 kilometers in areas such as Erlian, Inner Mongolia, from June to August this year. Systematic fossil excavations were carried out at twelve locations, unearthing a large number of precious ancient animal fossils. The fossils excavated from the Upper Cretaceous strata in the Erlian Salt Lake area mainly include hadrosaur fossils (an almost complete skeleton, eleven mandibles, and thousands of scattered bones) and ornithomimus, dinosaur, and crocodile fossils. Sauropod dinosaur fossils were also discovered here for the first time. A large number of ancient mammalian fossils were excavated in the Upper Eocene strata of Irdin Manha, Baleng Sum, and Ula Usu, including five skeletons and more than ten skulls of brontotheres, fifteen complete skeletons of ancient deer, two skulls of Embolotherium, as well as more than twenty different types of mammalian fossils such as tapirs, ancient ruminants, chalicotheres, and rodents. Skulls of mastodons, fossils of rhinoceroses and artiodactyls were found in the Upper Miocene strata of Tunggur and the Upper Miocene strata of Ulash Nor, and carnivore (viverridae) fossils that had not been recorded in the past were discovered at the latter location. These valuable fossils will provide important data for elucidating the origin and development of ancient mammals. At the same time, a large number of turtle, crocodile, and bird fossils were also discovered in the above areas. This investigation and research work will play an important role in exploring the history of the origin and development of terrestrial vertebrates, reptiles, mammals, and birds.

“Juyan Han Slips” Published

The discovery of ancient bamboo and wooden slips has been recorded many times. Among them, the "Bamboo Annals" and "Biography of King Mu" unearthed in Ji Commandery are still important materials for studying ancient history.

In the late nineteenth century, Han and Jin slips were unearthed in the Northwest region a total of eight times, with the most slips unearthed in Juyan. Among them, the "Yongyuan Weapon Register" still retains the original form of the register at that time, which is particularly valuable. From the writing brushes unearthed at the same time, the real shape of the writing tools at that time can be glimpsed. After this batch of Han slips was transported to Beijing in 1931, Ma Heng, He Changqun and others made partial textual research respectively. After the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937, all the Juyan Han Slips were stolen by American imperialism and are now in the Library of Congress in the United States.

In 1956, the Institute of Archeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences began to sort out this batch of materials based on the following three sources: (1) 143 glass negatives taken by the original Northwest Scientific Expedition in Beijing and stored in the institute; (2) more than 790 reversed photographs remaining in the Commercial Press; (3) Han slips from Juyan that had been scattered by Qiu Yuanshan. Although there are only more than 2,500 slips, they have exceeded the total number of Han and Jin wooden slips published in the past. Now, the institute has compiled these materials into a book called "Juyan Han Slips" (Series A), which has been handed over to the Science Press for photographic publication.

The "Sketch Map of the Edsin Gol River Basin" in the newly published "Juyan Han Slips" is reproduced based on the original map drawn by the original Northwest Scientific Expedition. From the Han Dynasty beacon towers and fortresses marked on the sketch map, the remains of the northwest end of the Han Dynasty Great Wall can be seen. The original Mongolian Pinyin place names on the map have now been supplemented with Chinese names.

Research Results on Wheat High-Yield Experience

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Northwest Institute of Biology and Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has summarized the experience of high wheat yields through large-scale investigation and research; the following research results have been obtained in the three aspects of dense planting, lodging, and deep plowing.

On the issue of dense planting. Through fifteen repeated dense planting and fertilizer double-factor experiments on different soils, it was found that the highest yield was obtained by applying 30,000 jin of manure per mu and sowing 20 jin; at the level of 30,000 to 80,000 jin of fertilizer, the yield tended to decrease when the sowing amount exceeded 20 jin; with the increase of the sowing amount, the number of ears per unit area tended to reach a limit; the size of the plant population and the development of individual plants have a functional relationship within a certain limit. The yield is the highest when the number of plants per unit area is the largest without affecting individual development.

Through large-scale comparative surveys and laboratory analysis, regarding the impact of lodging on wheat yield, they believe that whether lodging reduces wheat yield depends on the lodging period; the views of absolute yield reduction and no yield reduction are not appropriate. The preliminary ways to prevent wheat lodging are: advance the sowing period, carry out soil cultivation in the later stage, the ratio of topdressing in the jointing stage, and apply trace elements.

Regarding deep plowing, they believe that the effect of deep plowing on increasing production is certain. Deep plowing improves the physical and chemical properties of the soil and the activity of microorganisms. Deep plowing can promote the downward rooting of roots, but it cannot change the characteristic that most (80%) of wheat roots are distributed in the 0-40 cm soil layer. It is believed that wheat fields in the Guanzhong area should be deep plowed to a depth of eight inches to one foot.

Zhongshan University Compiles "Statistics on Population, Land, and Land Tax of China Through the Ages"

According to the "Theory and Practice" monthly magazine, Professor Liang Fangzhong of Zhongshan University, with the cooperation of his assistants, has completed the book "Statistics on Population, Land, and Land Tax of China Through the Ages." The book has more than 800,000 words, and it collects data on population, land, and land tax in China from the Western Han Dynasty to the late Qing Dynasty for about 2,000 years, making 213 statistical tables. The book is divided into three parts: main volume, appendix, and separate volume. The main volume is divided into two parts, A and B: Part A mainly concerns the overall situation of the national population and land, and the geographical distribution of the population in past dynasties; Part B mainly compiles the statistics on the national regional land and land tax of the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. The appendix is divided into statistics on county population, land, and land tax. The separate volume is a description of each table. The completion of this informative work has great reference value for historical science research and teaching, as well as other research work. This book lists different versions of various related records, widely draws on the achievements of previous collations, annotations, etc., and the research results of contemporary scholars, and puts forward its own views in the notes and explanations.

    古生物考察队
    发现大量动物化石
    由中苏两国古生物学者共同组织的“亚洲中部古生物考察队”，从今年6月到8月，在内蒙古二连等地区进行了长达八千多公里的路线探查，在十二个地点进行了系统的化石发掘工作，发掘出大量珍贵的古代动物化石。在二连盐池地区上白垩纪地层中发掘到的化石，主要有鸭嘴龙类化石（一个接近完整的骨架，十一个颔骨及数以千计的零星骨胳）和似鸟龙类、龙、鳄类等化石。蜥脚类恐龙化石也在这里第一次发现。在伊尔丁曼纳、八楞少庙和乌拉乌苏等上始新统地层中发掘出了大量的古哺乳类化石，其中包括雷兽的五个骨架、十多个头骨，古鹿的十五个完整骨架，两个梭齿兽的头骨以及貘类、古反刍类、爪蹄兽类和啮齿类等二十多种不同的哺乳类动物化石。在通古尔上中新统地层及乌首诺尔等地上中新统地层中找到了乳齿象类的头骨、犀类及偶蹄类的化石，并在后一地点发现了过去没有记载过的食肉类（灵猫科）的化石，这些宝贵的化石，将为阐明古哺乳类的起源和发展的研究，提供重要的资料。与此同时，在上述地区还发现了大量的龟类、鳄类和鸟类化石。这次调查研究工作，将对探索陆上脊椎动物、爬行类、哺乳类和鸟类的起源和发展的历史，有重要作用。
    “居延汉简”已出版
    古代简牍的出土见于记载的很多，其中汲郡出土的“竹书纪年”和“穆天子传”，至今仍是研究古史的重要材料。
    十九世末叶，西北地区汉、晋简牍的出土，共有八次，以居延出土的简数最多，而其中“永元兵器簿”尚存当时簿书编缀的原形，尤为可贵。从同时出土的毛笔更可窥见当时书写工具的真实形制。这批汉简自1931年运到北京后，曾经马衡、贺昌群等分别作了部分的考释。1937年抗日战争后，居延汉简已全部为美帝国主义窃去，现在美国国会图书馆。
    1956年中国科学院考古研究所根据下述三个来源，开始整理了这批材料。（一）该所所藏原西北科学考察团在北京所摄玻璃版一百四十三片；（二）商务印书馆残存的反体相片七百九十余条；（三）经裘元善手流散出的居延所出汉简。虽仅此二千五百余条，但已超过历次所发表的汉、晋木简的总数。现在，该所已将这些材料编成“居延汉简”（甲编）一书，交由科学出版社影印出版。
    新出版的“居延汉简”中“额济纳河流域略图”，系根据原西北科学考察团的测制原图复制的。从略图上所标出的汉代烽台和堡垒的地方，可以看到汉代长城西北端的遗迹。该图原有的蒙语拼音地名现已一一附加汉文今名。

    小麦丰产经验的研究成果
    中国科学院西北生物土壤研究所从1958年大跃进以来，经过大面积的调查研究，总结了小麦丰产经验；在密植、倒伏和深耕三方面，得到了下述研究成果。
    在密植问题上。通过不同土壤上重复十五次的密、肥双因子试验发现：每亩施用土粪三万斤、播种量二十斤的产量最高；施肥三到八万斤的水平下，播种量超出二十斤，产量有减低的趋势；随播种量的增加，单位面积穗数有达一极限的趋势；植株群体的大小与植株个体的发育在一定限度内有函数的关系，单位面积上株数最大，而又不影响个体发育时则产量最高。
    通过大面积对比调查和实验室分析，关于倒伏对小麦产量的影响问题，他们认为倒伏对小麦产量是否降低，要以倒伏时期为准；绝对减产与不减产的看法都不合适。并初步找出了防止小麦倒伏的途径是：提早播种期，后期进行培土，拔节期的追肥比例，施用微量元素等。
    关于深耕他们认为，深耕增产的效果是肯定的，深耕对土壤物理与化学性质、微生物活动都有改善；深耕可促进根系下扎，但不能改变小麦根系绝大部分（80％）分布在0—40厘米土层的这种特性；并认为，关中地区的小麦地以深耕八寸至一尺为宜。
    中山大学编成“中国历代人口土地田赋统计”
    据“理论与实践”月刊报道，中
  山大学教授梁方仲在他的助手的协作下，已编著完成“中国历代人口土地田赋统计”一书。此书篇幅达八十多万字，搜集了我国自西汉到清末约二千多年间有关户口、田地及田赋数字，制成统计表二百一十三张。全书分正编、附编和别编三部分。正编按
  内容分为甲、乙两篇：甲篇主要是关于全国户口、田地的总情况和历代户口在地域上的分布情况；乙篇主要是汇集唐、宋、元、明、清五朝有关的全国分区田地、田赋的统计数字。附编分为县户口田地、田赋统计。别编则为各表的说明。这部资料性著作的完成，对于历史科学的研究和教学以及其他研究工作都有很大的参考价值。此书备列了各种有关记载的不同版本，广泛吸取了前人校勘、注释等的成绩和当代学者的研究成果，并在附注和说明中提出了自己的见解。
