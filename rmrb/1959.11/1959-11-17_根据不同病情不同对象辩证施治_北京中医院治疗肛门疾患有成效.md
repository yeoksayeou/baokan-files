Beijing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital's hemorrhoids and fistula department has achieved satisfactory results in treating diseases such as hemorrhoids, anal fissures, rectal prolapse, and anal fistulas in recent years, with improvements in treatment methods.

From the establishment of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in June 1956 to July of this year, a total of 929 patients with hemorrhoids (internal and external hemorrhoids) were treated, of which 911 were cured, 10 showed improvement, and the outcomes of the remaining eight were unknown due to interrupted treatment. The hemorrhoids and fistula department has used four methods to treat hemorrhoids. Initially, "Kuzhi San" (external powder) was used. This method had the following disadvantages: it was painful for patients, could not be used for hemorrhoids hidden inside the anus, and could easily cause arsenic poisoning when the dosage was high (the main ingredient of Kuzhi San is arsenic). Later, hard Kuzhi suppositories were inserted into the hemorrhoids, which had some advantages over Kuzhi San, but were prone to causing bleeding, often did not completely corrode the hemorrhoids, and could corrode large blood vessels if inserted too deeply. Overdoses could also cause arsenic poisoning. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the hemorrhoids and fistula department conducted research and improvements, using a combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine to make Kuzhi medicine into an injection. One type of injection was modified from Kuzhi San, and the other was made from alum and glycerin. Western-style syringes were used to inject the medicine into the hemorrhoids, making it easier to control the dosage and depth, and simplifying the operation. The efficacy of these two injections was similar. Arsenic-containing injections caused fewer cases of arsenic poisoning than Kuzhi suppositories, but there were still some. Among 156 cases treated, 12 experienced mild arsenic poisoning. Alum injection did not cause arsenic poisoning, but the course of treatment was long and prone to causing bleeding in the affected area after treatment. Among 203 cases treated, 11 experienced bleeding. In addition, the hemorrhoids and fistula department also used ligation therapy, which has the advantage of removing hemorrhoids more thoroughly and not causing bleeding, but the disadvantage is that it is painful and may cause infection. They are studying methods to prevent side effects such as arsenic poisoning reactions, post-bleeding, infection, and pain that may be caused by Kuzhi therapy, and have already achieved results.

Lu Shi, the responsible doctor in the hemorrhoids and fistula department of the hospital, said that these treatment methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, and dialectical treatment should be based on different conditions and patients. However, comparatively speaking, injection methods are better in general. Therefore, this method has been mainly used for treatment recently, or a combination of injection and ligation methods is used. During treatment, appropriate dosage and operating techniques must be strictly controlled, and it must not be done rashly to avoid adverse consequences. When using arsenic preparations for treatment, the patient's liver and kidney function must be checked to prevent severe arsenic poisoning.

Rectal prolapse is a very troublesome disease. The hemorrhoids and fistula department of the hospital innovatively used alum liquid injections, combined with acupuncture and internal administration of traditional Chinese medicine. Among the 37 cases treated, the short-term efficacy reached 97%, and the long-term efficacy is still being observed.

Anal fissure is a common disease among outpatients in the hemorrhoids and fistula department of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital. They used methods such as excision and ligation, as well as acupuncture and dressing to treat it, and the cure rate reached 95% in more than 200 cases.

For anal fistula, they used incision and thread-drawing therapy according to different conditions. Over the years, they treated 502 cases, of which 479 were completely cured, 19 had significant effects, three were transferred to other hospitals because they were ineffective, and one deteriorated.

    根据不同病情不同对象辩证施治
    北京中医院治疗肛门疾患有成效
    本报讯　北京中医医院痔瘘科这几年来治疗痔核、肛裂、直肠脱垂和肛瘘等疾病收到满意的疗效，治疗方法也有改进。
    从1956年6月中医医院建院到今年7月，一共治疗了九百二十九例痔核（内痔和外痔）患者，其中治愈的九百一十一例，十例有进步，其他八例因治疗中断结果不明。该院痔瘘科先后采用过四种方法治疗痔核。开始用“枯痔散”（外用粉剂）治疗。这种方法有这样的缺点：病人痛苦，对隐藏在肛门里面的痔核不能使用，剂量大时容易引起砒中毒（枯痔散的主要成份是砒）。此后改用硬质的枯痔锭插入痔核，较枯痔散有若干优点，但容易引起出血，腐蚀痔核往往不彻底，插得深了可能腐蚀大血管，剂量多了也会发生砒中毒。在去年大跃进中，痔瘘科又作了研究改进，用中西医结合的办法，把枯痔药制成注射液，一种注射液用枯痔散改制成，另一种用明矾和甘油制成，用西医的注射器把药液注入痔核，剂量和深度都容易掌握，操作简便。这两种注射液的疗效相仿。含砒注射液引起砒中毒的病例较枯痔锭要少，但还是有。治疗一百五十六个病例中有十二例发生轻度砒中毒。明矾注射液不会引起砒中毒，但疗程长，并且在治疗后容易引起患部出血，治疗二百零三例中有十一例出血。此外，该院痔瘘科还采用结扎疗法，它的优点是去除痔核较彻底，不会出血，缺点是有疼痛，可能引起感染。他们对于枯痔疗法可能引起的副作用如砒中毒反应、后出血、感染、疼痛等，正在研究防止办法，并且已获成效。
    该院痔瘘科负责大夫路石说，这几种治疗方法都各有优缺点，要根据不同病情不同对象辩证施治，但比较起来，在一般情况下注射方法较好，所以近来主要是采用这种方法治疗，或采用注射与结扎方法混合治疗，在治疗时必须严格掌握合适的剂量和操作技术，决不能草率从事，以免发生不良后果；使用砒剂治疗时必须检查病人的肝、肾功能，防止发生严重的砒中毒。
    直肠脱垂是一种很麻烦的疾病。该院痔瘘科创用明矾液注射，并配合用针灸和内服中药，治疗的三十七个病例中，近期疗效达到97％，远期疗效正在观察中。
    在中医医院痔瘘科的门诊病人中，肛裂是常见的疾病。他们采用切除和结扎以及针灸、敷药等办法治疗，在二百多个病例中治愈率达95％。
    对于肛瘘，他们根据不同病情采用切开和挂线疗法，几年中治疗了五百零二个病例，全愈的四百七十九例，有显著疗效的十九例，无效转院的三例，一例恶化。　（吕新初）
