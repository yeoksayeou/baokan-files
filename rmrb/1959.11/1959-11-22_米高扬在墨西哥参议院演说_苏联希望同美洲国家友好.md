Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, November 20th: According to TASS, Soviet First Deputy Premier Mikoyan visited the Mexican Senate on the 19th at its invitation, and delivered a speech there. When Mikoyan arrived at the Parliament building, he was welcomed by a large crowd of Mexican residents gathered at the entrance of the Parliament, who shouted slogans such as "Welcome!" and "Long live the Soviet Union!"

Mikoyan delivered a speech after Senate President Villarreal delivered a welcoming speech. He said: Countries with different social systems can and should coexist peacefully. The Soviet Union hopes to maintain good relations with Mexico and with all American countries. The Soviet Union advocates strengthening Mexico's economic independence and hopes for Mexico's prosperity.

Referring to the issue of peace and disarmament, Mikoyan pointed out that the plan for complete and thorough disarmament proposed by Soviet government head Khrushchev at the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly proceeds from the essence of the entire Soviet peace policy. All mankind understands that new wars cannot be allowed to break out in the presence of modern destructive weapons. Mikoyan said that the Soviet people, the Congress, and the government are determined to defend the cause of peace and universal security. He expressed his hope that the peace-loving Mexican people, the Mexican Congress, and the government would also support the Soviet Union's peace initiatives. When Mikoyan left the venue after attending the parliamentary banquet, he was once again welcomed by Mexican residents lining the streets.
