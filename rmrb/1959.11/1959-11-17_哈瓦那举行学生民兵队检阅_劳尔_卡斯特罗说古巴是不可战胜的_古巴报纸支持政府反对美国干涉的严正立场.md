Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 15th - Cuban Minister of Revolutionary Armed Forces Raúl Castro reviewed students participating in military training at the Cárdenas Square of the University of Havana. This student detachment was formed after the recent air raids on Cuba. Female students also participated in the military training.

Raúl Castro spoke at the review. He pointed out that justice is on Cuba's side, making Cuba invincible. Speaking of conspiracies against Cuba, Raúl Castro pointed out: Cuba is a country born out of a very grand revolution, "the most profound revolution in Latin America." He said, "To answer every threat against us by moving forward is our slogan. They launched an aerial aggression against us, and we moved forward two steps: passing the 'Mining Law' and the 'Petroleum Law.'"

In response to accusations that the government is communist, he said, "This is a truly democratic revolution that allows for the existence of various thoughts and beliefs, only opposing those of all kinds who confront the revolution."

During his speech, he also introduced the heroic deeds of Camilo Cienfuegos, Chief of Staff of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, who recently sacrificed his life.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 15th - Cuban newspapers enthusiastically support the firm position taken by the government in its reply to the U.S. government on the 13th.

"Noticias del Día" said in an editorial published on the front page that this is "a historical document with rich material, a moving document that is more revealing than we originally expected." The newspaper believes that this note is "a powerful response" that narrates the development of Cuban-American relations, in which "our neighbors have always one-sidedly obtained exorbitant profits."

"Revolución" called the note a "firm and just" response. It said that the note clearly stipulates "the position our country takes at this critical moment." Carlos Robreño, a columnist for "El Mundo," pointed out in an article that the note proves with facts that Cuban war criminals in Florida, USA, are guaranteed to carry out conspiracies aimed at subverting Cuba. Jorge Martí, the deputy director of this newspaper, emphasized that it is necessary to list the unequal facts in past Cuban-American relations in the note, because the Platt Amendment, the latifundio system, and the single production and increasing unemployment caused by American investment have been burdens weighing on our country for half a century.

"Hoy" said, "This note sends out the voice of our country." The newspaper believes that the above-mentioned note "represents the legitimate demand to restore Cuban sovereignty." The newspaper said, "Although Cuba is a country with a small territory and no weapons, it is determined to exercise its right to freedom."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 14th - The six estates operated by King Ranch, the largest U.S. livestock company in Cuba, in Camagüey Province, have been taken over by the National Institute of Agrarian Reform. King Ranch is the largest U.S. livestock company operating in Cuba. The six estates that have been taken over cover 23,852 hectares and have 6,898 head of livestock.

At the same time as the takeover of King Ranch, the "Camilo Cienfuegos" Agricultural and Livestock Cooperative was established to commemorate the sacrificed Chief of Staff of the Revolutionary Armed Forces. The land and livestock owned by this cooperative are worth 4,729,779 pesos.

King Ranch was established by American capitalists in April 1958 after Batista's army drove a large number of farmers from the land they lived on and cultivated.

Xinhua News Agency, November 16th - Buenos Aires News: The Argentine Permanent Movement in Solidarity with Cuba recently issued a statement saying, "Imperialism remains determined to obstruct the political, social, and economic liberation sought by the Cuban government." The statement condemned "the interference of the U.S. government in preventing Cuba from buying the weapons it needs to safeguard its sovereignty, just like any other country in the world," and also condemned "the bombings carried out by aircraft that undoubtedly took off from the United States (against Cuba)."

The statement "publicly condemns the above-mentioned acts of undermining Cuban sovereignty" and expresses "the most resolute support for the Cuban people and the Cuban government in their struggle for a better future."

    哈瓦那举行学生民兵队检阅
    劳尔·卡斯特罗说古巴是不可战胜的
    古巴报纸支持政府反对美国干涉的严正立场
    新华社哈瓦那15日电　古巴革命武装部部长劳尔·卡斯特罗在哈瓦那大学卡德纳斯广场检阅了参加军事训练的学生，这支学生支队是在最近飞机空袭古巴的事件后组成的。参加军事训练的还有女学生。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗在检阅会上讲了话。他指出，正义是在古巴的一方面，这使古巴成为不可战胜的。劳尔·卡斯特罗在谈到反对古巴的阴谋时指出：古巴是在一次非常宏大的革命中产生的国家，这“是拉丁美洲一次最深刻的革命”。他说，“以向前迈进来回答对我们的每一次威胁，这是我们的口号。他们对我们进行了一次空中侵略，而我们向前迈进了两步：通过了‘矿业法’和‘石油法’。”
    在回答指责政府是共产党的问题时，他说，“这是一次真正民主的革命，它容许各种思想和信仰存在，只反对那些形形色色对抗革命的家伙。”
    他在讲话时还介绍了最近牺牲的革命武装部队参谋长西恩富戈斯的英勇事迹。
    新华社哈瓦那15日电　古巴报纸热烈支持政府13日在给美国政府的复照中所持的严正立场。
    “国民日报”在第一版发表的社论说，这是“一份有着丰富的材料的历史性文件，是一份激动人心的比我们原来所期待的更有揭露性的文件”。报纸认为：这份照会是“一个有力的回答”，它叙述了古巴和美国关系的发展过程，在古美关系中“我们的邻居过去总是片面获取暴利的”。
    “革命报”把这份照会称为是“坚定和正当的”回答。它说，照会明确地规定了“我国在现在这种危急时刻所采取的立场”。“世界报”发表的专栏作家卡洛斯·罗布雷诺的一篇文章指出，照会用事实证明，在美国佛罗里达的古巴战犯得到各种保障，来进行旨在颠覆古巴的阴谋活动。这家报纸的副社长豪尔赫·马蒂强调指出，照会中列举过去古美关系中的不平等事实是必要的。因为普拉特修正案和大庄园制度以及美国投资所造成的单一生产和不断增长的失业等事实是半世纪以来压在我国头上的重担。
    “今日报”说，“这份照会发出了我们国家的声音。”报纸认为，上述照会“代表了恢复古巴主权的正当要求。”报纸说，“古巴虽然是一个领土很小、没有武器的国家，但是决心行使它的自由权利。”
    新华社哈瓦那14日电　美国在古巴最大的一家畜牧业公司金氏牧场在卡马圭省经营的六处庄园已经被土地改革全国委员会接管。金氏牧场是美国在古巴所经营的最大的一家畜牧业公司，被接管的这六处庄园占地二万三千八百五十二公顷，有牲畜六千八百九十八头。
    在接管金氏牧场的同时，成立了“卡米洛·西恩富戈斯”农牧业合作社，以纪念这位牲牺了的革命武装部队参谋长。这个合作社所拥有的土地和牲畜价值四百七十二万九千七百七十九比索。
    金氏牧场是美国资本家在1958年4月间依靠巴蒂斯塔军队把大批农民从他们居住和耕种的土地上赶走之后建立起来的。
    新华社16日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷声援古巴永久性运动最近发表声明说，“帝国主义仍然决心阻挠古巴政府所争取的政治、社会和经济解放。”声明谴责了“美国政府的干涉行为，阻挠古巴像世界其他任何国家一样去购买它维护主权所需要的武器”，也谴责了“无疑是从美国起飞的飞机（对古巴）所进行的轰炸”。
    声明“公开谴责上述对古巴主权的破坏行为”，并表示“最坚决地支持古巴人民和古巴政府所进行的争取美好未来的斗争”。
