Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd: Reporter Shu Ti reports: In the Tianjin No. 6 Dyeing and Chemical Factory, even if a cut-off valve is installed or a piece of wood is added, as long as an innovation suggestion appears, it will receive enthusiastic support and help from the factory leadership, even if it does not greatly improve production efficiency. Precisely because of this, the factory's three hundred employees have put forward more than two thousand innovation suggestions in the past few days, and implemented more than six hundred of them, solving key problems in achieving high yield, high quality, low consumption, and safety for several major products in the factory.

Even minor technical innovation suggestions receive enthusiastic support and assistance, thereby increasing the enthusiasm of the workers for innovation. Similar examples are countless in the industrial system of Hongqiao District, Tianjin.

In the past, some factories and enterprises in Hongqiao District, due to their emphasis on major innovations and neglect of minor suggestions, had affected the enthusiasm of some workers in carrying out innovations. They felt that they could not handle those large innovation projects, which were the responsibility of technical personnel. After the Hongqiao District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party discovered this situation, it quickly criticized it and convened a conference on October 24, calling on all district employees to rely primarily on self-reliance, combining foreign and indigenous methods, working together from top to bottom, grasping both big and small, and everyone participating in the technical innovation movement. At the same time, the Hongqiao District Committee also decided to have the secretary in charge of industry take the lead in establishing a technical innovation committee, and transferred more than thirty capable cadres, including the head of the District Committee's Industry Department, to go deep into the grassroots to mobilize the masses. Each factory also took the first secretary of the Party committee as the leader, and established specialized organizations to lead innovation, ensuring that there were leaders at every level and someone responsible everywhere. From top to bottom, the mass technical innovation activities were emphasized, and the technical innovation enthusiasm of all district employees rapidly increased. Many factories, from workers to office cadres and technical personnel, and from major workshops to auxiliary workshops, participated in the technical revolution movement, forming a situation in which everyone innovates and every process is improved. According to statistics from the last four days alone, the district's 60,000 industrial employees have put forward more than 200,000 technical innovation suggestions. The Tianjin Vehicle Factory, after recently adopting the technical innovation suggestions of employees and implementing 22 major innovations such as semi-automation of mechanical continuous feeding, mechanization of riveting, and automation of cutting screw nuts, the production capacity of various types of work in the factory has increased by one to four times.

When the Hongqiao District industrial system grasped both large and small technical innovation and technical revolution suggestions together, it carried out organized and planned division of labor. The entire district, according to the size of the innovation project, the difficulty of implementation, and other specific circumstances, organized factories, workshops, and groups to cooperate and collaborate. If the group could not solve it, the workshop would solve it; if the workshop could not solve it, the factory would solve it; for major problems that the factory could not solve, the Hongqiao District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party would organize relevant factories in the district to cooperate and solve them. The employees praised this approach, saying: "The masses pick sesame seeds, the factories hold watermelons; the district collaborates greatly, innovation flowers bloom everywhere."

### 上下齐动手　大小一齐抓  天津红桥区组织全区工厂开展技术革新大协作

    上下齐动手　大小一齐抓
    天津红桥区组织全区工厂开展技术革新大协作
    新华社天津23日电　记者舒倜报道：在天津市染化六厂里，哪怕安一个截门、加一块木板，只要出现了革新建议，即使提高生产效率不大，也会得到厂领导方面的热情支持和帮助。正是因为这一缘故，全厂三百名职工在最近几天内就提出了两千多件革新建议，实现了六百多项。使工厂里几种主要产品实现高产优质低耗和安全的关键问题，获得解决。
    即使微小的技术革新建议，也受到热情的支持和帮助，从而提高了职工群众的革新积极性，类似这样的例子，在天津市红桥区工业系统是举不胜举的。
    过去，红桥区有些工厂企业由于偏重大革新轻视小建议，曾经影响了部分工人搞革新的积极性，他们觉得那些大的革新项目自己搞不来，是技术人员的事。中共红桥区委发现这种情况以后，迅速进行了批判，并且在10月24日召开了大会，号召全区职工自力更生为主、洋土并重，上下齐动手、大小一起抓，人人投入技术革新运动。同时，红桥区委还确定以负责管工业的书记挂帅，成立了技术革新委员会，抽调区委工业部长等三十多个得力干部，深入基层发动群众；各厂也都以党委的第一书记挂帅，成立了专门领导搞革新的组织机构，做到层层有人领导，处处有人负责。从上而下地重视了群众性的技术革新活动，全区职工的技术革新热情迅速高涨起来，许多工厂从工人到科室干部、技术人员，从主要车间到辅助车间的工人，都参加了技术革命运动，形成了人人有革新，道道工序有改进的局面。仅据最近四天统计，全区六万工业职工就提出了二十多万件技术革新建议。天津市车辆厂，最近采纳职工技术革新建议，实现了机械续料半自动化、铆钉机械化、切螺丝母自动化等二十二项重大革新后，全厂各工种的生产能力分别提高了一倍到四倍。
    红桥区工业系统在大小技术革新和技术革命建议一起抓的时候，进行了有组织、有计划地分工。全区根据革新项目的大小、实现的难易等具体情况，组织工厂、车间、小组分工协作。小组不能解决的，就由车间解决；车间不能解决的，就由工厂解决；本厂不能解决的重大问题，中共红桥区委就组织全区有关工厂协作解决。职工们称赞这种作法说：“群众拣芝麻，工厂抱西瓜；全区大协作，遍开革新花”。
