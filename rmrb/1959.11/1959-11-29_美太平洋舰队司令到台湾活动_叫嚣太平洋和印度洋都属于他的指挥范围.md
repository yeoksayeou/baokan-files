Xinhua News Agency, November 28th, Taipei dispatch: U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Hopwood was in Taiwan from November 25th to 27th engaging in activities.

Hopwood held talks with Chiang Kai-shek, U.S. Taiwan Defense Command Commander Smoot, and others in Taiwan. This U.S. Navy admiral, speaking to reporters in Taipei with the arrogant tone of U.S. imperialism treating the Pacific and Indian Oceans as American lakes, said, "The Pacific region within our command range (referring to the U.S. Pacific Fleet) extends from the west coasts of North and South America to an area reaching halfway into the Indian Ocean." He also admitted that the United States currently has two nuclear submarines, the "Snook" and "Halibut," and other conventional submarines operating in the Pacific. Recently, U.S. Pacific Area Army Commander White, Pacific Area Air Force Commander O'Donnell, and others have been to Taiwan for conspiratorial activities. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Cushing also "inspected" Taiwan from November 20th to 25th.

In addition, the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force Forward Headquarters in Taiwan announced that a batch of U.S. F-100 jet fighters will be redeployed to Taiwan on the 30th of this month. These aircraft will hold so-called "flight demonstrations" over Taipei and Tainan in early December.

    美太平洋舰队司令到台湾活动
    叫嚣太平洋和印度洋都属于他的指挥范围
    据新华社28日讯　台北消息：美国太平洋舰队总司令霍普伍德在25日到27日在台湾进行活动。
    霍普伍德在台湾曾分别与蒋介石、侵台美军司令斯摩特等举行了会谈。这个美国海军上将在台北对记者发表谈话的时候，以美帝国主义把太平洋和印度洋当作美国湖泊的狂妄口吻说，“我们指挥范围内（指美国太平洋舰队）的太平洋区域，是从南北美洲的西海岸直到伸入半个印度洋的领域。”他还承认，美国现在有“鲷鱼号”和“旗鱼号”两艘原子潜水艇和其他普通潜水艇在太平洋活动。最近美国太平洋区陆军总司令怀特、太平洋区空军总司令欧当纳尔等都曾到台湾进行阴谋活动。美国国防部副助理部长库兴也曾在20日到25日到台湾“视察”。
    另据美国第十三航空队驻台湾前进指挥部宣称，美国一批F—100型喷气战斗机将在本月30日增调到台湾。这批飞机将在12月初在台北、台南上空举行所谓“飞行表演”。
