    Year-Round Brick and Tile Production
    The old habit of seasonal production in brick and tile factories is about to be completely changed. The advanced experience of the "double-cylinder tunnel kiln" brought by Gu Yanming of the Taipingzhuang Brick and Tile Factory in Beijing to the National Congress of Heroes has made a significant contribution to solving this problem. This experience uses waste heat from the tunnel kiln instead of natural drying, shortening the drying cycle from 360 hours to 24 to 48 hours, increasing output by 40% to 60%, saving labor by 40%, and reducing costs by 20%.
    When Gu Yanming first proposed this suggestion, some people said: "There is no such kiln in the world, it is simply impossible." But with the support of the Party and relying on the strength of the broad masses, he finally succeeded in experimenting with the "double-cylinder tunnel kiln," shaking off the constraints of nature on brick and tile factories and turning brick and tile production into year-round production.

    常年生产砖瓦
    砖瓦厂季节性生产的老习惯，就要彻底改变了。北京市太平庄砖瓦厂顾延明带到全国群英大会上的“双筒轮窑”先进经验，对解决这一问题作了重大贡献。这项经验是利用轮窑废汽代替自然干燥，干燥周期从三百六十个小时缩短到二十四到四十八个小时，产量提高40％—60％，劳动力节约40％，成本降低20％。
    顾延明刚提出这个建议的时候，有人说：“世界上没有这样的窑，根本不行。”但在党的支持下，依靠广大群众的力量，他终于试验“双筒轮窑”成功，摆脱了大自然对砖瓦厂的束缚，使砖瓦的生产变为常年性生产。
