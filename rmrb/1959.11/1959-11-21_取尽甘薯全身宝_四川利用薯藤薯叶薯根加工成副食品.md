Chengdu, November 20th (People's Daily) -- Sichuan is promoting the slogan of "Fully Utilize the Treasures of Sweet Potatoes" during the sweet potato (also known as red sweet potato) harvest, taking various measures to extensively utilize sweet potato by-products to conserve grain and increase livestock feed.

The entire sweet potato plant is a treasure. Besides the sweet potato itself, there are many by-products with significant economic value. The stems and roots can be ground into flour, used for brewing wine, and boiling sugar; the tips of the leaves and petioles can be made into dried vegetables and pickles; the vines can be used as livestock feed. However, in the past, some areas did not pay enough attention to sweet potato by-products, and large quantities of stems, roots, and leaves were used as fuel or fertilizer.

This year, through education on increasing production and practicing economy, people in various regions have decided to collect, completely harvest, properly store, and utilize all sweet potato by-products, while also focusing on harvesting the main product. Li Tongxing, the First Secretary of the Yanting County Party Committee, went deep among the masses to summarize the experience of comprehensively utilizing sweet potato by-products. He convened an on-site meeting in Fuyi District to introduce the economic value and processing methods of sweet potato by-products to cadres and the masses using concrete facts. Although the economic value of sweet potato by-products is considerable, the processing methods are simple. Sweet potato leaves and roots can be picked, washed, and dried for use as vegetables, and can also be mixed with rice; sweet potato leaf tips and petioles can be blanched in boiling water, salted, pickled for a day, and dried to make excellent dried vegetables; sweet potato roots can be sliced and used to make jelly or ground into flour. Therefore, when the county party committee called on the entire county to store 200 catties of dried sweet potato leaves and 100 catties of dried sweet potato roots per person, and 1,000 catties of silage sweet potato vines per pig, the broad masses of commune members responded enthusiastically. When digging sweet potatoes, all people's communes organized dedicated personnel to collect by-products and immediately process them. The county has collected more than 80 million catties of sweet potato leaves, stems, and roots from already-dug sweet potato fields.

Xichong County, a high-yielding sweet potato county, adopted the method of conducting debates at each level and meticulously accounting at each level to enhance the masses' awareness of sweet potato by-products. It also dispatched more than 200 technicians to provide on-site guidance. Through the efforts of the commune members, great results have been achieved. Currently, the county has recovered more than 8 million catties of sweet potato stems; each person has stored more than 300 catties of sweet potato leaf tips. The people's communes in the county have guaranteed the completion of the plan to utilize sweet potato by-products, recovering 10 million catties of sweet potato leaf tips, 74 million catties of sweet potato stems, more than 50 million catties of sweet potato roots, and ensiling 900 million catties of sweet potato vines. This will provide the people of the county with half a year's supply of vegetables and pigs and cattle with a year's supply of green fodder; at the same time, it can save a large amount of grain.

The Qingmuguan People's Commune in Ba County increases its income by 1,000 catties of by-products for every mu of sweet potatoes dug. The commune canteen uses by-products to make steamed buns, dumplings, and dishes that are sweet and fragrant. The commune members are very satisfied, and their enthusiasm for collecting by-products has increased.

In order to prepare sufficient green fodder for the great development of pig raising this winter and next spring, the counties are also launching a "Ten Thousand Silos, One Billion Catties" campaign for ensiling sweet potato vines. According to incomplete statistics from seven special districts, 750,000 silage silos have already been built, and 4.1 billion catties of sweet potato vines have been ensiled. (Liu Zongtang)

### 取尽甘薯全身宝  四川利用薯藤薯叶薯根加工成副食品

    取尽甘薯全身宝
    四川利用薯藤薯叶薯根加工成副食品
    本报成都20日电　四川各地在收获红苕（甘薯）时提出“取尽红苕周身宝”的口号，采取各种办法，大量利用红苕副产物，节约粮食和增加牲畜饲料。
    红苕周身是宝，除苕块外，还有许多经济价值很大的副产物。苕柄、苕根可磨面粉、酿酒、熬糖；苕叶尖、叶柄可制干菜、咸菜；苕藤可作牲畜饲料。但是过去有些地方对红苕的副产物重视不够，大量苕柄、苕根、苕叶等都当作燃料或肥料用了。
    今年，各地群众经过增产节约的教育，在注意收好红苕主产物的同时，决定把副产物也全部收完、收尽、保管好、利用好。中共盐亭县委第一书记李同兴，深入群众总结了综合利用红苕副产物的经验，在富驿区召开现场会议，用具体事实向干部、群众介绍红苕副产物的经济价值和处理方法。红苕副产物经济价值固然很大，但处理的方法却很简单。苕叶、苕根摘下来洗净晾干，就可当菜，还可掺饭吃；苕叶尖、叶柄放在开水里烫一下，加上咸盐腌一天，晾干，是很好的干菜；苕根切细后可作凉粉、磨面粉。因此，当县委号召全县每人收贮干苕叶二百斤、干苕根一百斤，每口猪青贮苕藤一千斤，广大社员热烈响应。各人民公社在挖红苕时，都组织专人收拣副产物，并立即加以处理。全县在已挖过的红苕地里，收摘了苕叶、苕柄、苕根等八千多万斤。
    红苕高产县的西充县，采取层层开展辩论、层层算细账的办法，提高群众对红苕副产物的认识，并派出二百多个技术人员实地指导。经过社员们的努力，取得很大成果。现在，全县已收回苕柄八百多万斤；每人储备苕叶尖三百多斤。该县各人民公社保证完成利用红苕副产物的计划，收回苕叶尖一千万斤、苕柄七千四百万斤、苕根五千多万斤，青贮苕藤九亿斤。这样，可供应全县人民半年的蔬菜和猪、牛一年的青饲料；同时可节约大量粮食。
    巴县青木关人民公社每挖一亩红苕，增收一千斤副产物。公社食堂用副产物做成馒头、包子、饺子和菜肴，又甜又香，社员吃了很满意，收拣副产物的情绪更加高涨。
    为了给今冬明春养猪大发展准备足够的青饲料，各县还开展“万窑亿斤”青贮红苕藤运动。据七个专区不完全统计，现已修建青贮窑七十五万个，青贮红苕藤四十一亿斤。　（刘宗棠）
