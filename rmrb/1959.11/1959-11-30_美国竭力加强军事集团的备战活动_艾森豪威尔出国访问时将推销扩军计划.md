Xinhua News Agency, 28th November, Washington Dispatch: While the U.S. government is currently paying lip service to peace, it is also frequently sending signals to the various aggressive military blocs it has cobbled together to strengthen their war preparations. This incident once again demonstrates that the "peace" trick played by the U.S. government is merely a smokescreen aimed at concealing its intensified pursuit of aggressive and war policies.

    U.S. President Eisenhower, in a letter to Senator Humphrey released on the 26th, made no secret of the fact that the U.S. will "continue to develop" "common defense and security arrangements with many free world countries." An analysis of Eisenhower's upcoming overseas visit published by United Press International on the same day stressed that Eisenhower will emphasize to the U.S.'s "allies" that they will still need to make "many efforts" in the military sphere for many years to come.

    The U.S. has always regarded the North Atlantic Group as the "backbone" of its various aggressive blocs. On the eve of the group's Council meeting in mid-December, U.S. government officials and generals are sparing no effort in clamoring for the strengthening of this military bloc's military strength. U.S. Secretary of State Herter, at the recently concluded North Atlantic Treaty Organization Parliamentary Conference, harped on the "Cold War" cliché, declaring that the U.S. does not believe that the West's "common defense work can be relaxed somewhat," that "the U.S. will continue to fully support the North Atlantic Treaty Organization," and that "this policy has not changed." General Norstad, Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group's forces and an American, also shouted in a speech earlier this month that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's forces in Western Europe "must remain strong" and strengthen the so-called "deterrent." Former Secretary of State Acheson demanded that the U.S.'s "allies" "make efforts and sacrifices" in terms of military expansion, and blatantly clamored that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's aggressive spearhead should "look towards Eastern Europe."

    The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee's "research report" on U.S. policy towards Western Europe has drafted a military expansion plan for this aggressive military bloc, suggesting that in addition to increasing the North Atlantic Treaty Group's forces to the originally planned thirty divisions as soon as possible, another sixty reserve divisions should be established.

    The "Central Treaty Organization" cobbled together by the U.S. in the Near and Middle East is also stepping up its military expansion activities. In order to accelerate the "arming" of this military bloc, the U.S. has recently decided to appoint U.S. military personnel to serve as the chairman of the military committee of this military bloc and the chief of staff of the standing military representative group next year. The military committee will draft details on the establishment of a "joint command" of the treaty participating countries, planning to establish a "joint conventional army" of the "Central Treaty Organization" in the style of the North Atlantic Group. U.S. Vice President Nixon recently urged the Middle Eastern members of this military bloc not to "relax their efforts" in terms of military expansion, and said that the U.S. will continue to strongly support the "Central Treaty Organization."

    Under the planning of the U.S., the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has also been constantly holding meetings recently, plotting conspiracies to aggravate the tense situation in the Far East and formulating ways to strengthen the "combat" capabilities of the military bloc's forces. In addition, the U.S. is also planning military expansion and war preparation activities in the Pacific region and North America through the ANZUS Council and the U.S.-Canada "joint defense" treaty.

    It is worth noting that the U.S. is not only strengthening its existing military alliances, but is also actively preparing to form new military alliances. The U.S. and the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government have scheduled to sign a new U.S.-Japan "security treaty" in January next year in order to accelerate Japan's nuclear armament and use a rearmed Japan to harm peace in the Far East. On this basis, the U.S. is also stepping up its long-planned activities to put together a Northeast Asian alliance. The secret military conference recently held by the U.S. in Baguio, Philippines, with representatives from Japan, the Philippines, etc., as well as the Chiang Kai-shek clique, is an example.

    At the same time, the U.S. government has recently colluded with its servants in many places, especially in the Asian region, to hold a series of provocative military exercises. These diverse exercises include the U.S. Air Force's "attack" exercise in Taiwan in November, the U.S. Navy's so-called "joint mine sweeping and laying exercise" with the Philippine and Chiang Kai-shek navies in the waters south of Taiwan, the U.S.'s secret large-scale missile exercise in Okinawa, the "Central Treaty Organization's" so-called "air defense" exercise in Pakistan, the U.S. Air Force's so-called "rapid deployment" exercise from the U.S. mainland to Western Europe, and the so-called "modernized defense weapons performance" in West Germany, etc.

    In order to strengthen the military expansion and war preparation activities of these military blocs, the U.S. government is now planning to increase its military assistance to these blocs. An Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 26th said that in the current fiscal year, the U.S. has shipped approximately $1.8 billion worth of weapons to its Asian "allies," and the new plan for the next year will increase this figure to $2.1 billion, "in addition to increasing military assistance to Atlantic Treaty countries." In order to strengthen the foreign military assistance program, U.S. President Eisenhower has recently assigned the work related to this program to the direct leadership of the Department of Defense.

### 美国竭力加强军事集团的备战活动  艾森豪威尔出国访问时将推销扩军计划

    美国竭力加强军事集团的备战活动
    艾森豪威尔出国访问时将推销扩军计划
    新华社28日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府最近一面在侈谈和平，另一方面却频频向它拼凑的各个侵略性军事集团发出加强备战活动的信号。这件事又一次说明，美国政府玩弄的“和平”把戏只不过是一种烟幕，目的在于掩盖它的加紧推行侵略政策和战争政策的面目。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在26日公布的给参议员汉弗莱的一封信中毫不隐讳地说，美国将要“继续发展”同“许多自由世界国家的共同防御和安全安排”。合众国际社在同一天发表的分析艾森豪威尔即将出国进行的访问时着重指出，艾森豪威尔将向美国的“盟国”强调，在未来的许多年中，它们在军事方面仍将要作“许多努力”。
    美国一直认为北大西洋集团是它的各种侵略性集团的“脊骨”。在这个集团将在12月中旬举行理事会会议的前夕，美国政府人士和将军们不遗余力地叫嚷要加强这个军事集团的军事力量。美国国务卿赫脱在刚闭幕的北大西洋公约组织议员会议上大弹“冷战”滥调，扬言美国并不认为可以把西方的“共同防务工作放松一些”，“美国将继续全力支持北大西洋公约组织”，
  “这种政策没有改变”。北大西洋集团军总司令、美国将军诺斯塔德在本月初发表的一篇演说中也叫喊北大西洋公约组织在西欧的军队“必须保持强大”，加强所谓“威慑力量”。前国务卿艾奇逊要求美国的“盟国”在扩军方面“作出努力和牺牲”，并且赤裸裸地叫嚷北大西洋公约组织的侵略矛头要“朝东欧看”。
    美国参议院外交委员会发表的关于美国对西欧政策的“研究报告”为这个侵略性军事集团拟订了一个扩军计划，它建议除了把北大西洋公约集团军队尽快增加到原订的三十个师以外，还要再建立六十个后备师。
    美国在中近东拼凑的“中央条约组织”也在加紧进行扩军活动，为了加快给这个军事集团“装上牙齿”，美国最近已决定指派美国军人担任这个军事集团的军事委员会明年的主席和常设军事代表小组的参谋长。军事委员会将拟订关于建立条约参加国的“联合司令部”的细节，计划依照北大西洋集团的式样建立一支“中央条约组织”的“联合常规军”。美国副总统尼克松最近督促这个军事集团的中东成员国在扩军方面不能“放松努力”，并且说美国将继续大力支持“中央条约组织”。
    在美国的策划下，东南亚条约组织最近一个时期也不断举行会议，策划加剧远东紧张局势的阴谋和拟订加强这个军事集团的军队的
  “作战”能力的办法。此外，美国还通过美澳新理事会和美加“联防”条约，策划在太平洋地区和北美的扩军备战活动。
    值得注意的是，美国不但在加强原有的军事联盟，而且还在积极筹组新的军事联盟。美国和日本岸信介政府已预定在明年1月签订新的日美“安全条约”，以便加速日本的核武装，并且利用重新武装起来的日本来为害远东和平。在这基础上，美国还在加紧进行蓄谋已久的拼凑东北亚联盟的活动，美国最近在菲律宾碧瑶召开的有日本、菲律宾等以及蒋介石集团代表参加的秘密军事会议就是一个例子。
    与此同时，美国政府最近伙同它的仆从在许多地方，特别是在亚洲地区，举行了一连串的挑衅性的军事演习。这些名目繁多的演习包括在11月份举行的美国空军在台湾举行的“攻击”演习，美国海军同菲律宾和蒋介石的海军在台湾南部海面举行的所谓“扫雷布雷联合演习”，美国在冲绳举行的秘密的大规模导弹演习，“中央条约组织”在巴基斯坦举行的所谓“空防”演习，美国空军从美国本土到西欧的所谓“迅速调遣”演习以及在西德举行的所谓“现代化防御武器表演”等等。
    为了加强这些军事集团的扩军备战活动，美国政府现在正打算增加对这些集团的军事援助。美联社26日自华盛顿发出的一条消息说，在本财政年度，美国运给它的亚洲“盟友”的武器为十八亿美元左右，而下一年度的新计划将把这个数字增加到二十一亿美元，“此外还要增加对大西洋条约国家的军事援助”。为了加强对外军事援助计划，美国总统艾森豪威尔最近已把有关这个计划的工作划给国防部直接领导。
