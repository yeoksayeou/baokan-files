The fact that small blast furnaces in Yunnan Province have extensively and substantially reduced iron smelting costs below the national standard is very encouraging.

Small blast furnaces are only a year old. A year ago, many places with iron smelting conditions were mostly wilderness. However, under the call of the Party, a surging mass movement for large-scale steel production immediately swept the country. Red flames of indigenous and small blast furnaces ignited in many remote mountains and fields, and many farmers who had just put down their hoes used their wisdom and hands to smelt large quantities of pig iron. Today, the "small foreign groups" enterprises, developed on the basis of the "small indigenous groups" enterprises in the iron and steel industry, have become a powerful new force on the steel front, undertaking about half of the country's pig iron production. With the increase in pig iron production and the improvement of quality, the iron smelting costs of many enterprises have also decreased month by month, and some enterprises have reduced them to below the national standard, some even approaching the level of large blast furnaces. How can such a situation not be gratifying!

Right-leaning opportunists once launched a massive attack on the mass campaign for steel production, saying that the cost of small blast furnaces was too high and "not worth the candle," and that the "Great Leap Forward diluted the concept of economic accounting, representing the squandering of a prodigal son," and so on. These fallacies are self-defeating. In the early days of the large-scale steel production, due to insufficient equipment, technical equipment, and work experience, it was inevitable that the cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces would temporarily be higher. It was not worth being alarmed. Today, not to mention that the cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces across the country is decreasing quarter by quarter, the fact that small blast furnaces in Yunnan Province have extensively and substantially reduced costs powerfully refutes the attacks of right-leaning opportunists. Yunnan was originally a province that did not produce iron and steel. In September this year, when the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry convened a national conference on the cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces, the representatives of Yunnan Province made a guarantee to the conference: to reduce the cost of each ton of pig iron from the average of 195 yuan and 39 cents in the third quarter to below 180 yuan in the fourth quarter of this year. In this way, they would not only not need national subsidies, but also turn losses into profits, accumulating funds for the country. Is this something done by a "prodigal son"? Right-leaning opportunists boast that they are the best at accounting. What kind of accounts do they actually know how to calculate? In fact, they only calculate economic accounts, not political accounts, only small accounts, not large accounts, only immediate accounts, not long-term accounts. According to them, it is better to engage in more capitalism than to engage in more socialism, that is, it is more worthwhile not to engage in socialist revolution and socialist construction. Isn't the essence of right-leaning opportunists clear enough?

Newborn forces are invincible. Preventing the development of "small foreign groups" enterprises is like an螳臂挡车 (idiom: an ant trying to fell a tree), and it is of no use. We are advocates of continuous revolution. The growth and strengthening of small blast furnaces in Yunnan Province, and the monthly reduction of costs, are a victory for the Party's continuous revolution theory and a victory for the Party's "walking on two legs" policy. The longer the time, the greater the role of "small foreign groups" enterprises will be. Look! The flames of small blast furnaces are burning brighter and higher. Small blast furnaces across the country are developing rapidly, and no one can stop its development and growth.

    小高炉的红火
    黎夫
    云南省小高炉大面积地大幅度地把炼铁成本降低到国家规定的指标以下，是一件十分鼓舞人心的事情。
    小高炉诞生不过一年，一年以前许多具有炼铁条件的地方大部分是一片荒野。可是，在党的号召下，一个汹涌澎湃的大炼钢铁的群众运动，立即席卷全国，许多荒僻的山野燃起了土高炉、小高炉的红火，许多刚刚放下锄头的农民用自己的智慧和双手，炼出了大量的生铁。今天，在钢铁“小土群”企业基础上发展起来的“小洋群”企业，已经成为钢铁战线上的一支强大的新生力量，担负起全国生铁产量一半左右的任务。随着生铁产量的增加，质量的提高，许多企业的炼铁成本也逐月下降，有些企业已经降低到国家规定的标准以下，有的接近大高炉的水平。这样的形势，又怎能不叫人欢欣鼓舞呢！
    右倾机会主义分子对于全民大炼钢铁，曾经大肆攻击，说什么小高炉成本太高，“得不偿失”呀，说什么“大跃进冲淡了经济核算观点，是败家子、大少爷作风”呀，等等。这种谬论本来是不攻自破的。在大办钢铁初期，由于设备条件、技术装备、工作经验不足种种原因，小高炉的生铁成本暂时出现较高的现象，是事物发展过程中不可避免的现象，不值得大惊小怪。今天，我们且不说全国小高炉生铁成本一季度比一季度降低，只是云南省小高炉大面积大幅度地降低成本的事实，就有力地回击了右倾机会主义者的攻击。云南原是属于不产钢铁的省份。今年9月，冶金部召开全国小高炉生铁成本会议时，云南省的代表向大会提出保证：在今年第四季度把每顿生铁的成本由第三季度的平均一百九十五元三角九分降低到一百八十元以下。这样，他们不仅不要国家补贴，而且可以转亏为盈，为国家积累资金。难道这是“败家子”干出的事情么？右倾机会主义分子夸耀自己是最会算账的。他们究竟会算什么账呢？其实，他们只算经济账，不算政治账，只算小账，不算大账，只算眼前账，不算长远账。在他们说来，多搞点社会主义，不如多保留点资本主义，也就是说搞社会主义革命和社会主义建设，不如不搞来得合算。右倾机会主义分子的本质不是再清楚不过么？
    新生力量是不可战胜的，阻止“小洋群”企业的发展，那不过是螳臂挡车，无济于事。我们是不断革命论者，云南省小高炉的成长壮大，成本逐月降低，是党的不断革命论的胜利，是党的“两条腿走路”的方针的胜利。时间越长，“小洋群”企业的作用就越来越大。看！小高炉的红火越烧越旺，越升越高。全国小高炉正在飞速发展着，它的发展壮大是谁也不能阻止的。
