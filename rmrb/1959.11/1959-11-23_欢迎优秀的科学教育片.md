    Welcome Excellent Science Education Films
    Kunming, Fang Yongling
    During the National Day celebration, we watched many excellent feature films and documentaries, and also appreciated good science education films. Their characteristic lies in not simply and boringly giving technical explanations, but in skillfully integrating the soaring enthusiasm of the people with the analysis of scientific knowledge. For example, in the agricultural film "Large-Area High Yield of Wheat," it was reported that, inspired by the General Line, the farmers of North China promoted the communist spirit of daring to think and act, broke with the old wheat cultivation methods of thousands of years, and used new, refined, and scientific cultivation methods to achieve a great victory of large-area, high-yield wheat production. Also, films like "The Green Great Wall" and "Mountain Canal" showed us the heroic people of Gansu, under the leadership of the Party, marching forward boldly to conquer nature, planting a 4,500-kilometer green great wall on the province's land, diverting the waters of the Tao River to the high mountains, and building their country in the vast deserts and glaciers. Can you not be moved by the beautiful and magnificent rivers and mountains of our motherland and the great achievements created by the hardworking and brave people? Can you not be moved by the arduous labor of our 650 million people in building socialism? These science education films organically present scientific knowledge and the era of the Great Leap Forward in our country, which is novel and vivid, providing knowledge and contributing to production. They are excellent scientific teaching materials, as well as excellent political teaching materials that inspire our enthusiasm.

    欢迎优秀的科学教育片
    昆明　方永龄
    国庆期间，我们看到了许多部优秀的故事片、纪录片，同时也欣赏了好的科学教育片。它的特点在于不是单纯枯燥地作技术解说，而是把人民的冲天干劲和科学知识的分析二者巧妙地溶为一体。如农业方面的“小麦大面积丰产”，报道了华北农民在总路线的鼓舞下，发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，破除了千年陈旧的小麦耕种方法，用新的、精细的、科学的耕种方法，取得了小麦大面积高额丰产的伟大胜利。又如“绿色的长城”“山上运河”等，使我们看到了英雄的甘肃人民在党的领导下，昂首阔步向大自然进军，在全省的土地上种植了四千五百公里的绿色长城，把洮河的河水引上高山，在大沙漠大冰山里闯江山。你能不为我们祖国美好秀丽的山河和勤劳勇敢的人民创下的丰功伟业所感动吗？你能不为我们六亿五千万人民为建设社会主义而进行的艰巨劳动所感动吗？这些部科教片把科学知识和祖国大跃进的时代面貌有机地表现出来，新颖而生动，既给人以知识，又有助于生产，是很好的科学教材，也是很好的鼓舞我们干劲的政治教材。
