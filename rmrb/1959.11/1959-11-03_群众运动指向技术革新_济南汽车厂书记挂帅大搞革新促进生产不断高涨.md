    Mass Movement Points to Technological Innovation
    Jinan Automobile Factory Secretary Takes Command to Vigorously Promote Innovation, Promoting Continuous Production Increase
    (Our newspaper’s dispatch from Jinan on the 2nd) The Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Factory is vigorously promoting technological innovation, closely combining the surging mass movement with solid organizational work, enabling production to increase evenly and plans to be fully completed. The output value in September increased by 45% compared to August. Entering October, it is again red every day, completing the first ten-day plan with a score of 103%.
    In the midst of vigorously promoting the mass movement, the Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Factory Party Committee first grasped the crucial link of setting leap forward plans. Each time a production plan was set, advanced yet reliable production targets were proposed. Last year, the factory achieved a great leap forward. This year, in setting plans, they fully estimated the favorable conditions and set even greater leap forward plans that doubled last year's. In view of the fact that the plan was exceeded every month from January to August, after studying the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in September, criticizing right-leaning thoughts and relaxation moods, and fully mobilizing the masses, everyone used their brains and put forward a leap forward plan that increased by 16.6% compared to the actual growth in August. The practice of constantly proposing higher goals based on the actual situation has enabled the broad masses of workers to constantly maintain vigorous enthusiasm for advancement, promoting continuous increases in production.
    Continuously identifying and breaking through key problems is an important link in realizing the leap forward plan. After identifying the key problems at each level, the entire factory's workers are organized to formulate plans for breaking through the key problems and technological innovation measures around the key problems, and the masses are mobilized to implement them.
    In order to break through key problems and strengthen the leadership of technological innovation, the factory, led by the Party Committee Secretary, improved the factory's Technical Revolution Committee, established branch committees in each workshop, and formed technological innovation research groups in each work section. Each group was assigned a technological innovation member, changing the past phenomenon where no one was responsible for rationalization proposals, ensuring that every matter was accounted for and every item was implemented. After entering October, the factory, based on higher leap forward plans, identified eleven new major key problems and forty-six general key problems. By October 10, twenty-three key problems of varying sizes had been solved, and 377 innovation proposals had been implemented.
    Based on the characteristics of continuous production requiring coordinated action, the factory used a systematic "one-dragon" competition method, focusing on a single product, linking everything from production preparation to product warehousing through counterpart connections. The specific method is: At the beginning of each month, the factory leaders convene a three-level cadre connection meeting consisting of section chiefs, workshop directors, and work section leaders, and also absorb old worker representatives to participate, jointly propose tasks, identify key problems, and propose measures. Based on the tasks and key problems of the current month, requests and guarantees are proposed from the bottom up at each level. Counterpart connections are made at each level, schedules are arranged, agreements are reached, counterpart connection competition agreements are signed, and a factory-wide "big one-dragon" competition is launched. Each workshop and section, according to the requirements of the agreement, respectively convenes counterpart connection meetings in their respective departments, organizing each work procedure team and work section to also propose specific requirements such as progress and quality at each level, forming a "small one-dragon" to ensure that the workshop and work section complete the tasks on time. Each section then organizes a "one-dragon" competition of the same business between people and groups around the production key problems and weak links, ensuring that the workshop completes the production tasks ahead of schedule and in excess.
    This form of counterpart connection enables the later waves to push the earlier waves, and the earlier waves to lead the later waves, with everyone trying their best to achieve the requirements of the agreement.
    With the development of the movement, the factory correspondingly strengthened its enterprise management work to adapt to the needs of continuous leap forward in production. They first grasped the general pivot of the entire factory's production – production scheduling work – through a daily production scheduling meeting to promptly check the daily production progress of each workshop, new problems that arise, the supply of raw materials, the extent to which key production problems are solved, the situation of technological innovation, etc., and promptly solve problems when they are discovered. The second is to grasp the five-day plan. According to the requirements of the full-month plan, a small section plan is set every five days, and progress is grasped daily and on time. At the same time, a system was established for checking quality, progress, key problems, and safety shift by shift and day by day, and for holding factory-wide inspection meetings every five and ten days to further conduct key problem sorting and propose mutual collaboration requirements. This makes it easier to detect problems in a timely manner and organize new balances.
    The reason why the Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Factory's production and work are so outstanding is inseparable from the fact that the factory Party Committee has always adhered to putting politics in command and letting ideology lead in all aspects of its work. Especially since the promulgation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Party Committee has unswervingly taken the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session as a guideline in implementing all aspects of its work, strengthened the Party's leadership, vigorously promoted technological revolution and technological innovation, adhered to the working method of the mass line, fully mobilized the masses, and unified the work pace of various departments to carry out work around a common center. Under the strengthened unified leadership of the Party Committee, attention was paid to giving full play to the role of the administration, the trade union, the Communist Youth League, and organizations at all levels.

    群众运动指向技术革新
    济南汽车厂书记挂帅大搞革新促进生产不断高涨
    本报济南2日电　济南汽车制造厂大闹技术革新，把轰轰烈烈的群众运动和踏踏实实的组织工作紧密结合一起，使生产均衡上升，计划全面完成。9月份比8月份增加了45％的产值。进入10月份又是日日红，以103％的成绩完成了上旬计划。
    济南汽车制造厂党委在大搞群众运动中，首先抓住了订跃进计划这一环节。每次订生产计划时，都提出既先进又可靠的生产指标。去年全厂获得了大跃进，今年在订计划中，他们充分估计了有利条件，订出了比去年又翻了一番的更大跃进计划。鉴于1至8月份，月月超额完成计划的事实，9月份经过八中全会决议的学习，批判了右倾思想和松劲情绪，全面发动群众，人人动脑筋，又提出了比8月份实际增长16.6％的跃进计划。根据实际情况，不断提出更高目标的作法，使得广大职工经常保持着旺盛的前进热情，促使生产不断上升。
    不断排关键、破关键，是实现跃进计划的一个重要环节。层层排出关键之后，就组织全厂职工，围绕关键订出突破关键规划和技术革新措施，发动群众实现。
    为了突破关键和加强技术革新的领导，这个厂由党委书记挂帅，健全了厂的技术革命委员会，各车间成立了分会，工段组成了技术革新研究小组，各小组设一名技术革新员，改变了过去对合理化建议无人负责的现象，作到了件件有交代，条条有着落。进入10月后，这个厂根据更高的跃进计划，排出了十一个新的重大关键和四十六个一般的关键，到10月10日已解决了大小关键二十三个，实现革新建议三百七十七条。
    这个厂根据连续性生产必须协同动作的特点，以单一产品为对象，从生产准备到产品入库，有系统地用对口挂钩的方法串联起来，组织了“一条龙”竞赛。具体作法是：每月月初厂里领导召开科室、车间、工段长以上的三级干部挂钩会议，并吸收老工人代表参加，一起提任务、摆关键、摆措施，根据当月的任务与关键，由下而上层层提出要求和保证。层层对口挂钩，排出进度，达成协议，签订对口挂钩竞赛协议书，开展全厂性“大一条龙”竞赛。各车间、科室根据协议要求，分别召开本部门的对口挂钩会议，组织各工序班组、工段也层层提出进度、质量等具体要求，联成“一条小龙”，保证本车间、工段按时完成任务。各科室则根据车间要求，围绕生产关键和薄弱环节，组织人与人、组与组的同业务“一条龙”竞赛，保证车间提前超额完成生产任务。
    这种对口挂钩的形式，使得后浪推前浪，前浪带后浪，人人都千方百计来实现协议要求。
    随着运动的发展，这个工厂相应地加强了企业管理工作，以适应生产不断跃进的需要。他们首先抓住了指挥全厂生产的总枢纽——生产调度工作，通过每日一次的生产调度会，及时检查各车间当日生产进度、新出现的问题、原材料供应状况、生产关键解决到什么程度、技术革新情况等等，发现问题及时解决。其次是抓五日计划。根据全月计划要求，每五天订出一个小段计划，按日按时抓进度。同时，还建立了班班、天天检查质量、进度、关键、安全，5日、10日各开一次全厂性的检查会，进一步进行关键排队，相互提出协作要求的制度。这样就便于及时察觉问题，组织新的平衡。
    济南汽车制造厂生产、工作所以这样出色，是与厂党委在各项工作中一直坚持政治挂帅，思想先行分不开的。特别是从党的八届八中全会决议公布以后，党委在贯彻各项工作时都坚定不移地以八中全会决议为指针，加强党的领导，大搞技术革命和技术革新，坚持群众路线的工作方法，全面发动群众，并把各个部门的工作步调统一起来，共同围绕一个中心开展工作。在加强党委的统一领导下，注意了充分发挥行政、工会、共青团和各级组织的作用。
