    Steel Seizing Vanguard
    Fu Gang
    The workers of the furnace lining section of the No. 5 Steel Plant's converter workshop, in order to ensure the victory of the steel seizing campaign, shouted the battle cry "No furnace, no steel; lining workers are the vanguard!" While striving to improve furnace life, they launched a struggle to compress furnace repair time.
    Could the furnace repair time be further shortened? It seemed really difficult. Take furnace bricklaying as an example: to build an eight-ton converter requires more than 2,200 refractory bricks, plus other auxiliary materials, totaling more than forty tons. And a bricklaying team, excluding rotating workers, has only eleven or twelve people. Just moving these things into the furnace takes five or six hours, let alone meticulously laying them into a furnace lining. Eight hours seemed to be an insurmountable "limit".
    However, in the high tide of production, the workers in the furnace lining section broke through this "limit".
    Breaking Through the Eight-Hour "Limit"
    The first to break through this eight-hour "limit" were two bricklaying teams from Group B—the Zhang Zhijiang team and the Yang Dalong team. One team had been with the No. 5 Steel Plant since its founding, and the other was transferred from another factory later. During the 8th and 9th month competition craze, they broke down barriers, supported each other, and jointly challenged the other two groups. On the first day, only the Yang Dalong team was bricklaying, and the Zhang Zhijiang team had no furnace to build, so they took the initiative to send four skilled bricklayers to support them. The next day, the Zhang Zhijiang team built the furnace, and the Yang Dalong team sent all their manpower, letting them pick and choose.
    Once the cooperative situation opened up, the face of bricklaying work began to change. Originally, one group worked alone, and a dozen people had to build the furnace body, the furnace cover, mix sand, scoop sand, send sand, and schedule cranes and contact the transportation team. It was truly "one snail carrying one shell." The bricklayers were tired and had no one to replace them, so they had to stop work to rest, or switch work with others, which discounted work efficiency. With the cooperation of two groups, there were more people, and everyone had replacements. The work could proceed without interruption, and everyone's work was not as tiring as before, so efficiency was significantly improved. It was by relying on this collaborative power that Group B broke through the eight-hour "limit" a few days later, creating a new record of seven hours to build a furnace, running to the forefront of the three groups.
    Three Groups Compete to Create New Records
    When Groups A and C saw that Group B had broken through the eight-hour "limit", their confidence in accelerating bricklaying work was greatly strengthened. They said, "If Group B can do it, why can't we?" They immediately chased after them. "You are fast, but I am even faster!" A new wave of catching up with each other appeared among the three groups. First, Group A caught up with a record of six hours and forty-five minutes to build a furnace, and then Group C took the lead over Group A with scores of six and a half hours and six hours to build a furnace.
    In order to create more advanced new records for fast bricklaying, the bricklaying workers of Group A combined hard work with clever work, and used the favorable conditions of two-group cooperation to further innovate labor organization and operation methods. They increased the number of people building the furnace bottom from two to four, replacing the method of building half and then building the other half with a method of building on both sides simultaneously; and increased the number of people building the walls from four to six, with two people specializing in building the wall corners. In this way, the power of collaboration was further brought into play, and the speed of bricklaying was greatly accelerated again. The bricklaying workers of Group A successively created new records of two hours and fifty-three minutes and two hours and forty-seven minutes to build a furnace.
    The bricklaying workers of Group B were unwilling to fall behind. They were determined to learn from Group A, catch up with Group A, and surpass Group A to create higher new records. They not only earnestly studied Group A's experience in improving labor organization and operation methods, but also greatly developed it through collective research, creating a complete set of bricklaying methods that carried out various tasks simultaneously, which is what they themselves called the "two-legged bricklaying method". At this time, they also thought: If bricklaying can "walk on two legs", why can't the entire furnace repair work? Therefore, the more they studied, the greater their ambition, and the more methods they had. They decided not only to create new records for fast bricklaying, but also to cooperate with workers in other processes, and to fully apply the "two-legged walking method" to the entire furnace repair work. They would prepare bricklaying materials while demolishing the furnace, and prepare the furnace baking while bricklaying, closely connecting the three tasks to seize more steel from time.
    Once the wonderful plan was set, the workers in the furnace lining section of Group B were all eager to try. However, when it was their turn to work, there was no cooled furnace to repair. A No. 1 furnace that had just stopped for less than three hours was still emitting smoke from the furnace mouth. Under normal circumstances, this furnace would have to wait six or seven hours before it could be dismantled, and by that time, they would be about to get off work. The few people in the furnace dismantling team of Group B discussed it and decided to fight the high temperature in the furnace and start dismantling the furnace immediately. They divided the whole group into several batches, took turns working in the furnace, and worked hard and cleverly, fully using the "demolish the wall and collapse the whole house" rapid furnace dismantling method they had created, completing the furnace dismantling task in two hours and twenty minutes. At this time, the bricklaying workers were already prepared and immediately threw themselves into the hot battle, and used the "two-legged bricklaying method" to build the furnace in one hour and fifty-eight minutes. Then, the furnace baking workers, with everyone's support, put on the cover, joined the seams, and added coal. By the time they got off work, the fire was already lit in the furnace.
    Was the quality of the furnace repair so fast? Initially, some people expressed doubts. But the fact is that because this furnace repair adopted more scientific labor organization and operation methods, the furnace life reached sixty-eight heats, one heat more than the factory's previous highest furnace life!
    One Group Blossoms, Three Groups Bear Fruit
    The leap forward achievement of Group B's furnace lining workers in comprehensively compressing furnace repair time fully demonstrated the huge production potential provided by the combination of cooperation and innovation.
    Extensive mutual assistance and cooperation were carried out between various processes. The brick transportation team no longer waited for the bricklaying team to come and ask for bricks as in the past, but took the initiative to go to the furnace to understand the bricklaying progress, and delivered the bricks they needed before the bricklaying workers opened their mouths. The workers in the three processes of furnace dismantling, bricklaying, and furnace baking helped each other and supported each other, and were as united as one person.
    Extensive mutual assistance and cooperation were also carried out between the three groups of workers. You prepare materials for me, and I create conditions for you. As soon as a furnace stopped, the workers on duty, although they knew that they would not be able to repair this furnace, immediately turned on the cold air to make the furnace cool down quickly, so that the workers of the next group could start dismantling the furnace as soon as possible. When Group A knew that Group B was going to perform fast bricklaying for comrades from brother factories, they took the initiative to prepare materials for Group B when they got off work. When Group B saw that Group C's speed was increasing very slowly and could not catch up, they also prepared all the materials for them when they got off work, and wrote a letter, wishing them to create higher new records and catch up with themselves. After getting off work, they stayed to watch Group C's operation, told them about their experience, gave them ideas, and helped them create new records.
    Great cooperation caused a great exchange of innovative experiences. One group blossomed, and three groups bore fruit. Group A's experience in improving seam quality, Group B's experience in fast furnace dismantling, and Group C's experience in fast tuyere arrangement all became the common wealth of the three groups. The "two-legged bricklaying method" was constantly developed and perfected in the mutual supplementation of the three groups of workers. In this way, a comprehensive innovation took place in furnace repair technology.
    Great cooperation and great innovation further promoted the competition of catching up with each other. The three groups of workers are constantly creating new and newer achievements. The shortest bricklaying time has reached forty-nine minutes. The average furnace repair time has also been reduced from about fifty hours in the past to more than twenty hours. An average of five out of seven furnaces can be put into production every day. In this way, very favorable conditions have been created for the steel seizing campaign. Through the joint efforts of all the workers, the average daily output of the converter workshop has reached more than 1,000 tons. Now, the workers in the furnace lining section are consolidating their existing achievements, further improving the quality of bricklaying, and striving to create more favorable conditions for high yield and high quality.

    夺钢先锋
    傅刚
    上钢五厂转炉车间炉衬工段的工人们为了保证夺钢大战的胜利，喊出了“有炉才有钢，炉衬工人打先锋”的战斗口号，在努力提高炉龄的同时，展开了一场压缩修炉时间的斗争。
    修炉时间还能不能缩短呢？看起来，实在不大容易了。就拿砌炉来说，砌一只八吨转炉要用二千二百多块耐火砖，再加上其他辅助材料，一共有四十多吨。而一个砌炉小组除去轮休工人以外只有十一、二个人，光是把这些东西搬到炉里去，就要五、六个小时，何况还要把它们一丝不苟地砌成炉衬呢？八小时，似乎已经到了不可逾越的“极限”。
    可是，在生产高潮中，炉衬工段的工人却突破了这个“极限”。
    冲破八小时“极限”
    首先冲破八小时这个“极限”的，是乙班的两个砌炉小组——张志江小组和杨大龙小组。这两个组，一个是上钢五厂建厂时就来的，一个组是以后从外厂调来的。在大战8、9月的竞赛热潮中，他们打破了隔阂，相互支援，联合起来共同向其他两个班提出挑战。头一天，只有杨大龙小组在砌炉，张志江小组没有炉子可砌，就主动派出了四个砌炉能手去支援他们。第二天，张志江小组砌炉，杨大龙小组就把全组人马开了去，任他们挑兵选将。
    协作局面一打开，砌炉工作的面貌就开始改观。原来一个组单干，十来个人又要砌炉身、砌炉盖，又要拌砂、抄砂、送砂，还要调度行车、联系运输组，真是“一只螺蛳顶一只壳”，砌炉的累了没有人调换，只好把工作停下来休息休息，或者同其他人对调一下工作，这样就使工作效率打了折扣。两组一协作，人手多了，大家就有了替换，工作就可以毫不间断地进行，每个人的工作也不像过去那样劳累，效率就显著提高了。就是依靠这种协作的力量，乙班在几天之后就冲破了八小时的“极限”，创造了七小时砌一炉的新纪录，跑到了三班的最前面。
    三班竞创新纪录
    甲、丙两班一看乙班冲破了八小时的“极限”，加速砌炉工作的信心大大加强，他们说：“乙班能够做到，我们为什么不能做到？”马上急起直追。“你快，我比你还要快！”在三班之间，出现了一个新的你追我赶的热潮。先是甲班以六小时四十五分砌一炉的纪录赶了过去，接着丙班又以六小时半、六小时砌一炉的成绩走到了甲班的前面。
    为了创造更先进的快速砌炉新纪录，甲班砌炉工人把苦干和巧干结合起来，运用两组协作的有利条件，进一步革新了劳动组织和操作方法。他们把砌炉底的人从两个人增加到四个人，用两边同时砌的方法代替了砌好一半再砌一半的方法；又把砌墙的人由四个人增加到六个人，由两个人专门砌墙角。这样，协作的力量进一步发挥出来了，砌炉速度又大大加快，甲班砌炉工人连创了二小时五十三分和二小时四十七分砌一炉的新纪录。
    乙班砌炉工人哪肯落于人后，他们决心要学甲班、赶甲班、超甲班，创造更高的新纪录。他们不但认真学习了甲班改进劳动组织和操作方法的经验，而且通过集体研究，大大加以发展，创造了一整套把各种工作同时进行的砌炉方法，也就是他们自己所说的“两条腿走路的砌炉法”。这时，他们又想到：砌炉能够“两条腿走路”，整个修炉工作为什么就不能呢？于是，越研究雄心越大，越研究办法越多，就决定不但要创造快速砌炉新纪录，而且要和其他各个工序的工人协作，在整个修炉工作上全面运用“两条腿走路”的方法，一面拆炉一面准备砌炉材料，一面砌炉一面动手准备烘炉，把三项工作紧紧衔接起来，创造一个全面的快速修炉新纪录，向时间夺取更多的钢。
    妙计一定，乙班炉衬工段的工人们个个跃跃欲试。可是，偏偏到他们上班的时候，没有一个冷却的炉子好修。刚刚停下来不到三小时的一座一号炉，炉口还在冒烟，按一般情况来讲，这只炉子还要过六、七个小时才能动手拆，到那时候，他们也就快要下班了。乙班拆炉组的几个人一商量，决定和炉内高温斗一斗，马上动手拆炉。他们把全组分成几批，轮流到炉子里去干，并且苦干加巧干，充分运用自己创造的“拆墙倒全屋”的快速拆炉法，以二小时二十分的时间完成了拆炉任务。这时，砌炉工人已经作好准备，马上就投入了火热的战斗，又运用“两条腿走路的砌炉法”以一小时五十八分的时间就砌好了炉子。紧接着，烘炉工人就在大家支援下上盖、接缝、加煤，到下班的时候，炉子里已经点着了火。
    炉子修得这么快，质量怎么样呢？开始，有人表示怀疑。可是事实是，正因为这次修炉采取了更加科学的劳动组织和操作方法，炉龄达到了六十八炉，比全厂以往的最高炉龄还多一炉！
    一班开花　三班结果
    乙班炉衬工人全面压缩修炉时间的跃进成绩，充分显示了协作和革新相互结合所提供的巨大生产潜力。
    在各道工序之间，广泛地开展了互助协作。运砖组再也不是像过去那样等砌砖组找上门来要砖头，而是主动跑到炉子上去了解砌炉进度，不等砌炉工人开口，就把他们需要的砖头送来了。拆炉、砌炉、烘炉三道工序的工人更是你帮我助，相互支援，团结得像一个人一样。
    在三班工人之间，也广泛地开展了互助协作。你为我准备材料，我为你创造条件。只要那个炉子一停，当班的工人虽然知道自己修不到这只炉子，但也马上打开冷风，使炉子赶快冷却，使下一班的工人能够及早动手拆炉。甲班知道乙班要向兄弟厂的同志表演快速砌炉，下班时就主动为乙班准备好材料。乙班看到丙班的速度提高得很慢，老是赶不上来，在下班时也为他们准备了全部材料，并且写了一封信，预祝他们创造更高的新纪录，赶过自己。下班后，他们又留下来看丙班操作，向他们讲经验，为他们出主意，帮助他们创造新纪录。
    大协作引起了革新经验的大交流。一班开花，三班结果，甲班提高接缝质量的经验、乙班快速拆炉的经验、丙班快速摆风眼的经验，都成了三班的共同财富。“两条腿走路的砌炉法”更是在三班工人的相互补充中不断发展，不断完整。这样，在修炉技术上就出现了一场全盘大革新。
    大协作、大革新进一步推动了你追我赶的竞赛。三班工人不断创造着新的、更新的成绩。最短砌炉时间达到了四十九分钟。平均修炉时间也从过去的五十个小时左右减少到二十多个小时。七只炉子每天平均有五只可以投入生产。这样，就为夺钢大战创造了大为有利的条件。经过全体工人的共同努力，转炉车间的平均日产量已达一千吨以上。现在，炉衬工段的工人正在巩固已有的成绩，进一步提高砌炉质量，努力为高产优质创造更有利的条件。
