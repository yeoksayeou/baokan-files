Beijing, November 29 (Xinhua News Agency) – The vast numbers of workers in Beijing's construction and municipal enterprises, after achieving major victories in autumn construction, have begun a large-scale winter construction campaign.

This year's winter construction workload in the capital is substantial. The Beijing Construction Engineering Bureau system alone plans to put over 1.6 million square meters of projects into winter construction, equivalent to one and a half times the amount of last winter. Winter construction projects include a large number of newly built industrial buildings such as the Beijing Bearing Factory and the Winery, as well as new and expanded projects for colleges such as the Central University for Nationalities, Beijing Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture, and the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, as well as workers' dormitories and other buildings. Construction projects range from foundation work and main structure construction to decoration work.

The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held a city-wide five-level cadre conference on the 26th with nearly 10,000 participants from construction and municipal enterprises. The conference summarized the brilliant victories of autumn construction and put forward the tasks for winter construction. The meeting called on all workers to immediately take action and seize the opportunity to enter into the winter construction battle, continuing to focus on increasing labor productivity, engaging in large-scale technical revolution and technical innovation, and launching a larger-scale winter production upsurge to ensure the comprehensive completion of this year's construction tasks with guaranteed quality and quantity.

Many construction sites have made preparations for cold and frost protection in advance. The expansion project site of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory has developed a set of technical measures for winter construction. Various pipelines have been wrapped up, and windbreak walls and insulation sheds have been built for on-site work sheds and machine rooms. When the temperature dropped recently, hot water has been used to mix concrete, and additives have been used to prevent freezing. Many construction sites have strengthened safety, fire prevention, and other work in response to the characteristics of winter construction. The catering staff at the Beijing Thermal Power Plant construction site also cover the food with quilts and use cars and handcarts to deliver food to workers far from the canteen.

Xining, November 29 (Xinhua News Agency) – Basic construction sites in the Xining area have started entering winter construction one after another since mid-November.

There are more than 190 winter construction projects in the Xining area this year, including 84 industrial projects. The key projects listed for winter construction this year include: the Xining Fertilizer Plant, Paper Mill, Ceramic Factory, Brick and Tile Factory, Biological Pharmaceutical Factory, Comprehensive Wood Processing Factory, Qiaotou Power Plant, and dormitory projects for various universities and colleges. The blast furnace, coking oven, ferroalloy workshop, and dolomite workshop of the Xining Steel Plant will also accelerate construction throughout the winter to meet the needs of the rapid industrial development in the Xining area.

In order to ensure the smooth progress of various projects during winter construction, the Qinghai Provincial Basic Construction Committee issued "Provisional Regulations for Winter Construction of Building Engineering" to various construction units before the arrival of winter. Qinghai Province and Xining City construction companies have also formulated technical measures for winter construction and conducted education on winter construction for all employees.

Baotou, November 29 (Xinhua News Agency) – The large-scale Baotou Steel Mineral Processing and Sintering Plant has begun full-scale construction, marking the beginning of Baotou Steel's large-scale winter construction. This is another key project being built at Baotou Steel after the No. 1 Blast Furnace.

After the mineral processing and sintering plant is completed, the ore can greatly increase pig iron production, reduce the consumption of coke and limestone, and shorten the smelting time of the blast furnace. Therefore, Baotou Steel employees, unafraid of the severe cold, decided to build it ahead of schedule in the winter and ensure that it is completed as soon as possible. Now, the construction site is bustling with activity, vehicles are speeding around, and a lively construction scene is everywhere.

At the Baiyun Obo Iron Mine construction site, it is freezing cold, and the temperature forces the mercury in the thermometer down to a dozen degrees below zero. Here, the large-scale project of the Baiyun Obo Iron Mine's coarse crushing system has been under winter construction for more than a month. Several months ago, the employees of this mine compiled a winter construction plan and prepared sufficient steam boilers, heating pipes, straw, grass bags, sawdust, and other construction insulation materials. Therefore, at the beginning of winter construction, the project proceeded well and quickly. Now, the earthwork and concrete pouring projects have been basically completed, and the machine installation project is about to begin.

Since entering November, more than 60 projects in Baotou Steel's mining, coking, water source, ironmaking, steelmaking, and other systems have started winter construction.

    北京开始大规模冬季施工
    西宁抓紧时间在冬季建设一百九十多项工程
    包钢建设职工冒严寒兴建选矿烧结厂
    本报讯　首都建筑、市政企业广大职工，在取得秋季施工的重大胜利以后，又开始了一个大规模的冬季施工。
    今年首都冬季施工的工程量很大，仅北京市建筑工程局系统计划投入冬季施工的工程就有一百六十多万平方米，相当于去年冬季施工量的一倍半。冬季施工工程有北京轴承厂、葡萄酒厂等大批新建的工业建筑工程，还有中央民族学院、北京土木建筑工程学院、中医学院等院校新建和扩建工程，以及职工宿舍等楼房。施工项目从基础工程、主体结构工程到装修工程，样样都有。
    中共北京市委在26日召开了全市建筑、市政企业近万人参加的五级干部大会，总结了秋季施工的辉煌胜利，提出了冬季施工的任务。会议号召全体职工，立即行动起来，不失时机地转入冬季施工大战，继续以提高劳动生产率为中心，大搞技术革命和技术革新，掀起更大规模的冬季生产高潮，保证按质按量全面地完成今年的建设任务。
    很多工地早已提前做好了防寒防冻的准备。北京农业机械厂扩建工程工地，制订了一套冬季施工的技术措施，各种管道都已经包扎起来，现场的工作棚和机房等，也都搭起挡风墙和保温棚；在近日气温下降的时候，已经开始用热水搅拌混凝土，加药剂防冻。许多工地针对冬季施工的特点，加强了安全、消防等工作。北京热电站工地的炊事人员还用棉被把饭菜盖得严严的，专门用汽车和手推车给远离食堂的工人送饭菜。
  据新华社西宁电　西宁地区各基本建设工地，已从11月中旬开始陆续进入冬季施工。
    西宁地区今年冬季施工的项目共有一百九十多个，其中工业项目有八十四个。列为今年冬季施工重点项目的工程有：西宁肥料厂、造纸厂、陶瓷厂、砖瓦厂、生物药品制造厂、木材综合加工厂、桥头电厂和各高等学校校舍工程。西宁钢厂的高炉、焦炉、铁合金车间、白云石车间，也将在整个冬季加速建设，以适应西宁地区工业迅速发展的需要。
    为了保证冬季施工中各项工程顺利进行，青海省基本建设委员会在冬季来临前，就向各施工单位发出“建筑工程冬季施工暂行规定”。青海省和西宁市各建筑公司，也制定了冬季施工技术措施，并向全体职工进行了有关冬季施工的教育。
    据新华社包头29日电　规模巨大的包钢选矿烧结厂开始全面动工兴建，揭开了包钢大规模冬季施工的序幕。这是继包钢一号高炉以后，在包钢开始兴建的另一项重点工程。
    选矿烧结厂建成以后，矿石经过选矿烧结，就可以大大增产生铁、减少焦炭、石灰石的消耗，可以使高炉缩短冶炼时间。因此，包钢职工不畏严寒，决定提前在冬季来建设它，并且保证尽快地把它建成。现在，工地上热气腾腾车辆飞奔，到处呈现着热火朝天的建设景象。
    在白云鄂博铁矿山工地上，天寒地冻，气温把寒暑表上的水银柱逼到零下十几度。在这里，规模很大的白云鄂博铁矿粗破碎系统的工程，已经冬季施工一个多月了。几个月以前，这个矿山的职工们就编制好了冬季施工方案，准备了足够的蒸汽锅炉、散热管、稻草、草袋子、锯末等施工保暖器材。因此，冬季施工一开始，工程就进行得又好，又快。现在土石方和混凝土浇灌工程已经基本完工，机器安装工程也即将开始。
    进入11月份以来，在包钢的矿山、焦化、水源、炼铁、炼钢等系统，一共有六十多项工程开始了冬季施工。
