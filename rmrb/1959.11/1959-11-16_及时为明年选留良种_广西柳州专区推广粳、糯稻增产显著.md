Xinhua News Agency: Various regions across the country are actively selecting and retaining high-quality seeds of various crops in preparation for a bumper harvest next year. As of late October, incomplete statistics from the provinces (regions) and cities of Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Beijing show that over 5.7 billion jin of major autumn crop varieties have already been selected and retained.

In the seed selection process, all regions have implemented the principle of self-propagation, self-selection, self-retention, and self-use. Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces have completed more than half of their seed selection and retention plans for various crops. The southern provinces have basically concluded their coarse grain seed selection work and are entering a high tide of late rice seed selection. Zhejiang Province held on-site promotion meetings everywhere, and by the end of October, 34 counties had convened high-quality seed evaluation meetings. Various regions also attach great importance to the selection and retention of good seeds for potatoes, cotton, and peanuts. At present, some areas that have completed the seed selection tasks are generally turning to checking the quantity, quality, storage, purity, germination rate, and moisture content of the seeds.

Taking advantage of the good harvest of autumn vegetables, various regions are also seizing the time to select and retain vegetable seeds.

The vast rural areas of Tibet, which have just undergone democratic reforms, have also launched autumn harvest and seed selection activities. In Nangang Ouxi Township in the suburbs of Lhasa, 82 farmers were selected to study the significance and methods of seed selection, and after vigorous publicity to the masses, they took the lead in actively selecting seeds.

This newspaper reports: The Liuzhou Special Zone in Guangxi Province has established a "seed testing system" from bottom to top, specializing in the testing, cultivation, breeding, and promotion of improved varieties. This is an important measure to ensure the continuous leap forward in grain production.

The Liuzhou Special Zone has an agricultural science experiment station and a good seed breeding farm at the special zone level, a good seed farm in each county, and an experimental farm in the people's communes, forming an experimental system throughout the special zone. The improved varieties tested and identified by the agricultural experiment station at the special zone level are re-tested and expanded for breeding and promotion through the county and commune level good seed farms. In addition, the special zone has also established seven good seed demonstration areas as bases for promoting good seeds. The CPC Liuzhou Prefectural Committee attaches great importance to the promotion of good seeds, and from the prefectural committee to the various levels of party committees, there is a member in charge. In July of this year, "seed companies" were established from the special zone to the counties to uniformly manage the collection, promotion, storage, allocation, and technical guidance of good seeds.

Since the second half of last year, the Liuzhou Special Zone has regarded the promotion of japonica and glutinous rice as an important measure to increase production. The special zone's agricultural experiment station collected 20 japonica and glutinous rice varieties and compared them with the local high-quality indica rice variety "Baihua 516." Under the same conditions of water conservancy, fertilizer, and cultivation, 15 varieties had higher yields than "Baihua 516," with yield increases ranging from 19% to 89%. Under the leadership of the prefectural committee, trial planting of japonica and glutinous rice was carried out from mountainous areas and hills to plains, and the yield was generally 20% higher than that of indica rice. Therefore, this year, a total of 1.1 million mu were promoted throughout the special zone, accounting for more than one-quarter of the total planting area of mid-season and late-season rice. Due to the promotion of japonica and glutinous rice, the average mu yield of over 40,000 mu of mid-season rice in the Damao Mountain Miao Autonomous County was 915 jin, an increase of 23% over last year; 250 mu had a mu yield as high as 1,900 jin. Good news of bumper harvests has also been frequently reported from other counties. As for late-season japonica and glutinous rice, they are also growing very well, and a bumper harvest is already a certainty. The black japonica rice in Pingxi Brigade of Weixing Commune, Laibin Town, Laibin County, is taller than people, with ears one foot long and an average of 200 grains per ear. It is estimated that it will increase production by one time compared with the indica rice planted in the same period last year. The Liuzhou Special Zone has already made plans to plant japonica and glutinous rice for all mid-season rice next year, and to plant japonica and glutinous rice for more than half of the late-season rice. The counties have already started to retain and select seeds and allocate seeds.

### 及时为明年选留良种  广西柳州专区推广粳、糯稻增产显著

    及时为明年选留良种
    广西柳州专区推广粳、糯稻增产显著
    据新华社讯　全国各地正在为明年丰收积极选留各种作物的优良品种。截至10月下旬，河北、山西、山东、河南、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、内蒙古、青海、浙江、安徽、湖南、江西、四川、北京等省（区）、市的不完全统计，已选留大秋作物品种五十七亿多斤。
    各地在选种中，都贯彻了自繁、自选、自留、自用的方针。辽宁、吉林、黑龙江三省已完成各种种子选留计划的一半以上。南方各省杂粮选种工作已基本结束，转入晚稻的选种高潮。浙江各地大抓现场促进会，至10月底已有三十四个县召开了良种评选会。各地对薯类、棉花、花生选留良种也很重视。目前一些已完成选种任务的地方，正普遍转入检查种子的数量、质量、保管、纯度、发芽率、水分等工作。
    各地还在趁秋菜丰收的大好时机，抓紧蔬菜的选种留种工作。
    刚经过民主改革的西藏广大农村，也展开了秋收选种活动。拉萨市郊区南岗欧西乡，抽出八十二个农民学习选种的意义和方法后，大力向群众宣传，并带头积极选种。
    本报讯　广西柳州专区自下而上建立了一套“种子试验系统”，专门从事良种的试验、培育、繁殖、推广工作。这是确保粮食生产不断跃进的重要措施。
    柳州专区在专区一级设有农业科学试验站、良种繁殖场，各个县有良种场，人民公社有试验场，全专区形成一个试验系统。经过专区一级的农业试验站试验鉴定的良种，通过县、公社层层的良种场再次试验并扩大繁殖推广。另外，专区还建立了七个良种示范区，作为推广良种的基地。中共柳州地委十分重视推广良种工作，从地委到各级党委，都有一个委员领导。今年7月，从专区到各县成立了“种子公司”，统一管理良种的收集、推广、保管、调拨以及技术指导等工作。
    柳州专区去年下半年以来，以推广粳、糯稻作为一项重要的增产措施。专区农业试验站搜集了二十个粳、糯稻品种，和当地的籼稻优良品种“白花516”作对比试验，在同样的水利、肥料、耕作条件之下，有十五个品种都比“白花516”的产量高，增产幅度从19％到89％。在地委领导下，从山区、丘陵到平原，进行粳、糯稻的试种，一般都比籼稻增产20％。因此，今年全专区共推广一百一十万亩，占中造和晚造全部种植面积的四分之一强。大苗山苗族自治县由于推广粳、糯稻，有四万多亩中造平均亩产九百一十五斤，比去年增产23％；有二百五十亩，亩产高达一千九百斤。其他各县丰收也喜报频传。至于晚造粳、糯稻，也生长很好，大丰收已成定局。来宾县来宾镇卫星公社平西大队的黑粳，长的比人还高，穗长一尺，平均每穗二百粒，估计将比去年同期种的籼稻要增产一倍。柳州专区已经作出规划，明年全部中稻种粳、糯稻，晚稻一半以上种植粳、糯稻，现在各县已经动手做留种选种和调拨种子的工作。
