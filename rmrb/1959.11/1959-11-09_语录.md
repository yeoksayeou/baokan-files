    Socialism not only does not stifle competition, but for the first time creates the possibility of truly widespread and truly large-scale use of competition, attracting the vast majority of workers to participate in work, enabling them to show their skills, display their talents, and exert their genius in this work. Genius is inexhaustible among the people, but capitalism crushes, suppresses, and stifles this genius by the thousands and even millions.
    Now that the socialist government is in power, our task is to organize competition.
      (Lenin: "How to Organize Competition?")
    Sometimes people confuse socialist competition with rivalry. This is a big mistake. Socialist competition and rivalry represent two completely different principles.
    The principle of rivalry is the failure and death of some, and the victory and rule of others.
    The principle of socialist competition is that the advanced provide comradely help to the backward, thereby achieving universal improvement.
    Rivalry is: defeating the backward to establish one's own rule.
    Socialist competition is: some people work poorly, others work well, and still others work better—catching up with the better ones to achieve universal improvement.
      (Stalin: "Mass Competition and the Upsurge of Labor Enthusiasm")
    You have three strengths and play three roles. First, a leading role. This is because you work particularly hard, have many creations, your work has become a model for ordinary people, raised work standards, and inspired everyone to learn from you. Second, a backbone role. Most of you are not yet cadres, but you are already the backbone of the masses, the core of the masses. With you, work is easier to promote. In the future, you may become cadres; you are now the reserve force of cadres. Third, a bridge role. You are the bridge between the leaders above and the broad masses below. The opinions of the masses are passed up through you, and the opinions from above are passed down through you.
    (Mao Zedong: "Must Learn to Do Economic Work")
    The people are the creators of history. The history of human society, in the final analysis, is the history of production, the history of producers. Production is always in a state of development and change, with new production technologies constantly replacing old ones. Therefore, in any era and in any production sector, there are always a few relatively advanced producers who adopt relatively advanced production technologies and create relatively advanced production quotas. Subsequently, more and more producers learn their techniques and reach their quotas, until finally, the production level of the original few advanced elements becomes the production level of the entire society, and social production improves. If there is a major invention in production technology, it will cause a major reform in production technology, creating a huge surge in production. Therefore, advanced producers are the pioneers of the forward development of human economic life and the pioneers of the forward development of human social history.
    (Liu Shaoqi: "Congratulatory Speech at the National Conference of Advanced Producers")

    语录
    社会主义不仅不窒息竞赛，反而破天荒第一次造成真正广泛地、真正大规模地运用竞赛的可能，吸引真正大多数劳动者参加工作，使他们能够在这种工作中大显身手，施展自己的本领，发挥自己的天才。天才在人民中间是取之不尽的，可是资本主义却把这种天才成千上万乃至成百万地摧残、压制和窒息了。
    现在当社会主义政府执政时，我们的任务就是要组织竞赛。
      （列宁：“怎样组织竞赛？”）
    有时人们把社会主义竞赛和竞争混为一谈。这是很大的错误。社会主义竞赛和竞争代表两个完全不同的原则。
    竞争的原则是：一些人的失败和死亡，另一些人的胜利和统治。
    社会主义竞赛的原则是：先进者给予落后者以同志的帮助，从而达到普遍的提高。
    竞争是：打败落后者以确立自己的统治。
    社会主义竞赛是：一些人工作得不好，另一些人工作得好，再有一些人工作得更好，——赶上更好的以达到普遍的提高。
      （斯大林：“群众的竞赛和劳动热情的高涨”）
    你们有三种长处，起了三个作用。第一个，带头作用。这就是因为你们特别努力，有许多创造，你们的工作成了一般人的模范，提高了工作标准，引起了大家向你们学习。第二个，骨干作用。你们的大多数现在还不是干部，但是你们已经是群众中的骨干，群众中的核心，有了你们，工作就好推动了。到了将来，你们可能成为干部，你们现在是干部的后备军。第三个，桥梁作用。你们是上面的领导人员和下面的广大群众之间的桥梁，群众的意见经过你们传上来，上面的意见经过你们传下去。
    （毛泽东：“必须学会做经济工作”）
    人民群众是历史的创造者。人类社会的历史，归根结底，是生产的历史，是生产者的历史。生产是永远处在发展变动的状态中的，新的生产技术不断地代替着旧的生产技术。因此，在任何时代，在任何生产部门中，总是有少数比较先进的生产者，他们采用着比较先进的生产技术，创造着比较先进的生产定额。随后，就有愈来愈多的生产者学会了他们的技术，达到了他们的定额，直至最后，原来是少数先进分子的生产水平就成为全社会的生产水平，社会生产就提高了。如果有重大的生产技术的发明，就要引起生产技术的重大改革，创造生产的巨大高涨。因此，先进生产者是人类经济生活向前发展的先驱，也是人类社会历史向前发展的先驱。
    （刘少奇：“在全国先进生产者代表会议上的祝词”）
