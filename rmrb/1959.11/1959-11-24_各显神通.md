    Each Displays Their Unique Talents
    Wang Pu
    "Everyone has suggestions, every machine has innovations," this is a resounding slogan put forward by the engine workshop of the Changchun First Automobile Factory in the technical innovation and technical revolution, after criticizing some cadres' "emphasizing the major while neglecting the minor" mentality. Under this slogan, the workers actively took action, and in a short period of time, the vast majority of the group workers had innovations, and the production capacity of each process in the entire workshop generally increased by 20% to 100%. This shows that the idea of "emphasizing the major while neglecting the minor" is incorrect, and technical innovation should be a mass movement in which everyone participates.
    Technical innovation and technical revolution are the main methods of the increasing production and practicing economy movement, with the aim of increasing quantity, improving quality, reducing costs, ensuring safe production, improving labor efficiency, and striving for better and more comprehensive leaps forward. Equipment and tools can be reformed, processes can be reformed, designs can be reformed, raw materials and materials can be reformed, and labor organization can also be reformed. The scope is very broad, and everyone in every position has room to use their talents, like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each displaying their unique talents. You can focus on complete sets, or you can focus on small details; improve as much as you can without letting go, as long as you take a step forward, and I take a step forward, and everyone takes a step forward, then the entire production will move forward. Moreover, things are always developing, and as long as we continue to work hard, small innovations can become large innovations, and simple innovations can become more technologically advanced innovations. Therefore, in technical innovation and technical revolution, we must boldly mobilize the masses and encourage everyone to dare to think and dare to act. If the leading comrades of the enterprise only emphasize grasping the big ones, and pay no attention to the small creations of the masses, then it is tantamount to drawing circles and setting precepts for the masses. This will dampen the enthusiasm of the masses, deflate the energy of the masses, and turn the originally hot mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement into a cold and cheerless activity for a few people.
    So, does this mean that in technical innovation and technical revolution, there should be no leadership and no planning? Should there be no specific requirements for the workers? Should the leading comrades not focus on the key points? Of course not. "Of the thousands of threads, the Party's leadership is the first," without the Party's leadership, there can be no real mass movement. The leading comrades of the enterprise can and should also make demands on the masses, but this is not contradictory to mobilizing the masses to widely participate in technical innovation and technical revolution.
    Production and construction are always developing. Any enterprise or workshop will have different weak links at different times, the so-called key problems. These key problems, whether it is insufficient equipment capacity, or the transportation capacity cannot keep up with the needs of production, or something else, will appear one after another, and when they are solved, production will move forward. The leading comrades of the enterprise must seize these key problems, and systematically concentrate the necessary manpower and material resources to solve them, and consciously guide everyone to concentrate their efforts to break through these keys. Without this, the work will have no focus, and the main contradiction will not be grasped. However, concentrating the necessary forces to break through the key points will not hinder the broad masses of workers from carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution in other links. For creations of universal significance, even if it is a small improvement in operating methods, it is necessary to organize and promote it in a timely manner, and quickly turn the new experiences and new technologies created by individuals or a few people into the wealth mastered by the majority.
    Technical innovation and technical revolution do not distinguish between large and small, indigenous and foreign, everyone participates, each contributes their strengths, there are both key innovations and a combination of points and surfaces. In this way, like the engine workshop of the First Automobile Factory, a new situation of generally improved production capacity can appear in a short period of time.

    各显神通

    “人人有建议，台台有革新”，这是长春第一汽车厂发动机车间在技术革新和技术革命中，批判了部分干部的“重大轻小”思想以后，提出的一个响亮口号。职工群众在这个口号下积极行动起来，在短短的时间内，绝大部分的小组工人都有革新，全车间各个工序的生产能力普遍提高20％到一倍。这说明了“重大轻小”的思想是不对的，技术革新应当是一个人人都参加的群众运动。
    技术革新和技术革命是增产节约运动的主要方法，目的是增加数量，提高质量，降低成本，安全生产，提高劳动效率，争取更好更全面的跃进。可以改革设备和工具，可以改革工艺，改革设计，改革原料和材料，也可以改革劳动组织，天地非常辽阔，每个岗位上的人都有用武之地，八仙过海，各显神通。可以抓成套的，也可以抓点滴的；能提高多少就毫不放松地去提高多少，只要你前进一步，我也前进一步，所有的人都前进一步，整个生产就向前发展了。况且事物都是要发展的，只要我们继续努力，小的革新可以变为大的革新，简易的革新可以变为技术更高的革新。所以，在技术革新和技术革命中，我们要放手发动群众，鼓励大家敢想敢干。如果企业的领导同志只强调抓大的，而对群众的点滴创造爱理不理的，那就无异于给群众划圈圈，定戒律。这就会挫伤群众的积极性，泄群众的劲，就会把本来是热气腾腾的群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，变为冷冷清清的少数人活动。
    那么，是不是在技术革新和技术革命中，就不应当有领导有计划呢？就不应当对职工群众提出具体要求呢？领导同志就不应当抓重点呢？当然不是。“千条万条，党的领导是第一条”，没有党的领导，就不可能有真正的群众运动。企业的领导同志，也可以而且应该对群众提出要求，但这和发动群众广泛地参加技术革新和技术革命运动是不矛盾的。
    生产和建设永远处在发展中。任何企业、车间，在不同的时期都会有不同的薄弱环节，即所谓关键问题。这些关键问题，或者是设备能力不足，或者是运输力量赶不上生产的需要，或者别的什么，是会一个接着一个出现的，解决了，生产就会向前推进一步。企业的领导同志要捉住这些关键问题，要有计划有步骤地集中必要的人力、物力加以解决，要有意识地引导大家集中力量突破这些关键。不这样，工作就没有重点，就没有抓住主要矛盾。但是，集中必要力量突破关键，丝毫也不会妨碍广大职工群众在其它环节上普遍进行技术革新和技术革命。对于有普遍意义的创举，即使是点滴的操作方法的改进，也要及时组织推广，迅速地把个别人或少数人所创造的新经验、新技术，变为大多数人所掌握的财富。
    技术革新和技术革命不分大和小，土和洋，人人动手，各献所长，既有重点革新，又有点面结合。这样，就可以像第一汽车厂发动机车间一样，在短短的时间内，出现生产能力普遍提高的新局面。
