While the U.S. government is paying lip service to peace, it is making every effort to intensify the "Cold War" and expand its war preparations. It plans to maintain a huge military budget of $41 billion in the coming year, with the focus on developing missiles; the Supreme Command of the North Atlantic Group, commanded by a U.S. general, plans to form a missile base network of more than 60 missile battalions in Western Europe by the end of next year; the United States is holding large-scale missile exercises in Okinawa; the U.S. delegation is trying its best to poison the international atmosphere, and once again proposed to include the so-called "Hungarian issue" on the agenda of the UN General Assembly; Herter and the U.S. representatives at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Parliamentary Conference tried to intensify anti-Soviet hysteria, advocating strengthening military groups and winning in the "Cold War."

    美国一面侈谈和平　一面加剧“冷战”
    美国政府在口口声声侈谈和平的时候，竭力加剧“冷战”，扩大备战活动。它拟定在下年度维持四百一十亿美元的庞大军事预算，其重点放在发展导弹上面；以美国将军作统帅的北大西洋集团最高司令部，计划到明年底在西欧组成一个包括六十多个导弹营的导弹基地网；美国在冲绳举行大规模的导弹演习；美国代表团极力毒化国际气氛，再次提出要把所谓“匈牙利问题”列入联大议程；赫脱和美国代表在北大西洋公约组织议员会议上，力图加剧反苏歇斯底里，鼓吹加强军事集团，在“冷战”中取胜。
