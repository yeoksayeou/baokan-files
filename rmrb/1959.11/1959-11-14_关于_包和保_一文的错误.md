    On Errors in the Article "Bao and Bao"
    After the publication of the article "Bao and Bao" on page 8 of this newspaper on October 25th, we received letters from readers pointing out factual inaccuracies in some of the figures. We did not contact the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and relevant departments before publication, nor did we verify the figures, which resulted in errors. This is our responsibility, and we express our apologies to the relevant parties and readers. Now, we publish the self-criticism of the article's author, Ji Zhongren, as follows: "The material I used in my humble work 'Bao' and 'Bao' was solely based on what I heard from a few individuals. I neither investigated and verified with the relevant authorities nor checked the specific figures. In the article, I mentioned that by 1964, the Baoding Special District would be preparing to supply Beijing with 4 billion jin of edible oil annually. Such a large figure is obviously wrong. Relying on hearsay to write the article demonstrates an extremely unserious attitude towards the propaganda work of the Party newspaper. I should take this as a warning." – Editor

### 关于“包和保”一文的错误

    关于“包和保”一文的错误
    本报八版10月25日发表“包和保”一文后，曾接到读者来信，指出其中个别数字失实。我们在发表前没有向中共河北省委和有关部门联系，也未核对数字，以致造成错误，这是我们的责任，特向有关方面和读者致歉，现将该文作者冀仲仁的检查发表如下：“拙作‘包’和‘保’一文，所据材料，仅系由个别人口中听来，既未向主管方面调查证明，也未曾核对具体数字。文中提到，到1964年，保定专区准备每年供应北京食油四十亿斤，这样大的数字，显然是错了的。靠了道听途说，即信笔成文，这是对党报宣传工作极不严肃的态度。我应引以为诫。”　——编　者
