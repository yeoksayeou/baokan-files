Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 23rd: Fan Wenbai, President of the Supreme People's Court of Vietnam and former Chairman of the Nam Ky (formerly Cochinchina) Resistance Administrative Committee, issued a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters today, on the 19th anniversary of the Nam Ky Uprising, expressing the Vietnamese people's firm opposition to the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's massacre of the South Vietnamese people, and pointed out that their adoption of such policies will inevitably lead to their own destruction.

Fan Wenbai said that immediately after the signing of the Geneva Accords, US imperialism immediately tried every possible means to gradually deepen its interference in South Vietnam, undermine the Geneva Accords, and conspire to permanently divide Vietnam, turning South Vietnam into a US military base and colony.

He said that in order to realize this conspiracy, US imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique have been and are adopting extremely brutal policies of suppression and massacre against South Vietnamese patriots. They put forward the so-called "National Policy of Denouncing Communists," using it to slander and suppress all those who have been and are constantly struggling for peace and the unification of the Vietnamese nation, first of all retaliating against former resistance personnel.

After listing the various inhuman and heinous crimes committed by the South Vietnamese authorities against the patriotic people, Fan Wenbai pointed out that the movement demanding peaceful reunification of the country and demanding democracy and improvement of people's lives has united an increasingly broad spectrum of people from all walks of life in South Vietnam. The US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique is completely bankrupt politically and morally and is increasingly isolated. They have come up with a new trick called the "Policy on Former Resistance Personnel." According to this policy, members of the Vietnam Workers' Party, leaders of youth groups for national salvation, women's associations, trade unions, farmers' associations, etc., militia and guerrilla members, the families of cadres who gathered in North Vietnam, and all those who are currently opposing their system are said to be "reactionary and treasonous elements," who cannot be "recognized as former resistance personnel" and will be executed by them under Decree No. 10 of 1959. Conversely, those who betray the motherland and betray the people, such as Ngo Dinh Diem and all the most reactionary, pro-American feudalists and comprador capitalists, can proclaim themselves "former resistance personnel" and "people who have made contributions to the motherland." In order to realize the above-mentioned conspiracy, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is currently surrounding, arresting, and torturing the masses in some areas, forcing them to surrender and confess those who participated in the resistance, the leading cadres and commanders of mass organizations and semi-armed organizations during the resistance.

Fan Wenbai further pointed out that in order to urge and help the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to persecute the South Vietnamese people, US imperialism sent a delegation to South Vietnam to plan the policies and plans for persecution for the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities. US advisors directly command the South Vietnamese army, and the tools used by the South Vietnamese security forces, military police, and police for persecution are all supplied by the United States. US imperialism also directly helps Ngo Dinh Diem train military police and police personnel. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's so-called "Committee Against Subversive Activities" is essentially the headquarters for suppressing and persecuting the people of Southeast Asian countries, and also participated in the formulation of Ngo Dinh Diem's plans to suppress and persecute the South Vietnamese people. Fan Wenbai said that the South Vietnamese people deeply realize that as long as US imperialism continues to stay in South Vietnam, the South Vietnamese people will not be able to escape the persecution of the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique for a single day.

Fan Wenbai talked about the people of North Vietnam being closely united with the people of the South, resolutely supporting the struggle of the South Vietnamese people.

He said that the people of the North have also launched a movement to transform anger into strength, and carried out production emulation movements, such as planting "Fu Li fields," striving to complete production plans ahead of schedule, etc. The people of North Vietnam deeply realize that the strength of the North will be a solid backing for the unification of the motherland.

He also mentioned that the people of North and South Vietnam demand that the International Commission take measures to stop the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's persecution of the South Vietnamese people.

Fan Wenbai finally pointed out that the more frantically the US-Ngo clique persecutes and suppresses, the more it will be met with broader and more resolute opposition from the South Vietnamese people. As Chairman Mao Zedong said: "All reactionaries try to annihilate the revolution by means of massacre, and they think that the more people they kill, the smaller the revolution will become. But contrary to this reactionary subjective wish, the fact is that the more people the reactionaries kill, the greater the revolutionary forces become, and the closer the reactionaries get to their extinction."

### 范文白就南圻起义十九周年发表谈话  美吴集团越反动越接近灭亡

    范文白就南圻起义十九周年发表谈话
    美吴集团越反动越接近灭亡
    新华社河内23日电　越南最高人民法院院长、前南圻（即前交趾支那）抗战行政委员会主席范文白在今天南圻起义十九周年纪念日对新华社记者发表谈话，表示越南人民坚决反对美国—吴庭艳集团屠杀南越人民，并指出它们采取这种政策必将自食其果。
    范文白说，日内瓦协议刚刚签订之后，美帝国主义便马上想尽办法，来步步加深对南越的干涉，破坏日内瓦协议，阴谋长期分割越南，把南越变成美国的军事基地和殖民地。
    他说，为了实现这个阴谋，美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团已经和正在对南越爱国者采取非常残暴的镇压、屠杀政策。他们提出了所谓“诉共国策”，利用它来污蔑、镇压曾经和正在为和平和越南国家的统一而不断进行斗争的一切人，首先是对前抗战人员进行报复。
    范文白历数了南越当局对爱国人民犯下的种种惨无人道的滔天罪行后指出，要求和平统一祖国，要求民主和改善人民生活的运动已经团结了越来越广大的南越各阶层人民。美国—吴庭艳集团在政治、道义上完全破产而日益陷于孤立。他们又想出了所谓“对前抗战人员政策”的新花样，根据这个政策，越南劳动党党员，救国青年团、妇女会、工会、农会等团体的负责人，民兵和游击队员，集结到北越的干部的家属和所有目前正在反对它们的制度的人，都被说成是“反动、叛国分子”，都不能被“承认是前抗战人员”，并将被它们根据1959年第十号法令来处决。相反，背叛祖国、背叛人民的分子，如吴庭艳和一切最反动的、亲美的封建主义者和买办资本家，却可以自封为“前抗战人员”和“对祖国有功劳的人”。为了实现上述阴谋，目前吴庭艳集团正在一些地方包围、逮捕、拷打群众，强迫他们自首和供出曾经参加抗战的人、抗战期间的群众团体和半武装组织的领导干部、指挥人员等。
    范文白又指出，为了督促和帮助吴庭艳集团迫害南越人民，美帝国主义派遣了一个代表团到南越，为吴庭艳当局策划进行迫害的方针和计划。美国顾问直接指挥南越军队，南越保安兵、宪兵和警察进行迫害的用具都是由美国供应的。美帝国主义还直接帮助吴庭艳培养宪兵和警察人员。东南亚条约集团的所谓“反对颠覆活动委员会”实质上是镇压和迫害东南亚各国人民的司令部，也参加了吴庭艳镇压和迫害南越人民的计划的制订工作。范文白说，南越人民深刻地体会到，美帝国主义继续赖在南越一天，南越人民便一天不能免受美国—吴庭艳集团的迫害。
    范文白谈到了越南北方人民紧密地和南方人民团结在一起，坚决支持南越人民的斗争。
    他说，北方人民还发动了化愤怒为力量的运动，开展了生产竞赛运动，如种“富利田”，争取提前完成生产计划等。越南北方人民深刻地认识到北方的强盛将是统一祖国的坚固后盾。
    他还说到，越南北方和南方的人民要求国际委员会采取措施，制止吴庭艳集团对南越人民的迫害。
    范文白最后指出，美吴集团越是疯狂迫害和镇压，它们就越要遭到南越人民更广泛、更坚决的反对。正如毛泽东主席所说：“一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。”
