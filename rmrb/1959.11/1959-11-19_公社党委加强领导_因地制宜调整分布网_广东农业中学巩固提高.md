According to the Southern Daily News, Guangdong's agricultural middle schools, established during the Great Leap Forward last year, are gradually being consolidated and improved, relying on the superiority of the people's communes. Currently, over 70,000 students in more than 800 agricultural middle schools are striving for a double harvest in both study and labor, with one hand on the hoe and the other on the pen. Recently, after opposing right-leaning thoughts that disregard farmers' cultural education, many agricultural middle schools in various locations have been successively increasing in number.

After communization, Party committees at the commune level strengthened their leadership over agricultural middle schools, implemented the Party's educational policy, adhered to the principle of half-farming and half-study, and criticized right-leaning thoughts and various misconceptions about agricultural middle schools. After the establishment of agricultural middle schools in Chao'an County, some wealthy peasants and those with bourgeois educational ideas adopted a skeptical and negative attitude, spreading the notion that agricultural middle schools were "not real schools." Many teachers and students were also influenced by these ideas, feeling that agricultural middle schools were "inferior" and were not at ease with teaching and learning. Party committees at all commune levels promptly strengthened their leadership over agricultural middle schools. Party secretaries and committee members gave reports at the schools to teachers and students, pointing out the bright future of agricultural middle schools and criticizing erroneous understandings of their nature, role, and future. Afterwards, the number of students attending classes increased from about 50% to over 95%. After communization at Zengcheng County's Paitan Agricultural Middle School, some students felt that the learning and living conditions of agricultural middle schools were not ideal, believing that studying was not as good as in ordinary middle schools, and labor was not as good as in production teams, and requested to drop out. The commune Party secretary and the head of the brigade, who also served as the principal and vice-principal, gave political lessons to the students at the school, clarifying the future, nature, and significance of agricultural middle schools; at the same time, they helped the school solve some practical problems, and the students settled down.

Under the unified leadership, planning, and arrangement of the people's communes, various localities adjusted the original agricultural middle school network according to local conditions, making it more conducive to production and education, and overcoming the shortcomings of being excessively scattered or excessively concentrated at the initial stage of establishment. Currently, there are three forms of agricultural middle schools in various regions: one is schools run by the commune, one is schools run jointly by brigades, and one is schools run by brigades. The agricultural middle schools in Chaoyang County were originally established by agricultural cooperatives and later turned into schools run by brigades. Because they were relatively scattered, the sources of students and teachers encountered some difficulties. Later, the county decided to have the communes run the schools in a unified manner based on the specific situation, so that the agricultural middle schools in the twelve communes all persisted. Some better-run communes have basically solved the problem of enrollment for graduates of higher primary schools.

The constant care and assistance given by the people's communes to the agricultural middle schools in terms of manpower and materials is an important condition for ensuring that teachers and students in agricultural middle schools can study and live normally. After communization, various localities have equipped agricultural middle schools with a group of teachers with higher levels of expertise and have strengthened the training of teachers. Communes and brigades in various localities have allocated a certain amount of farmland to agricultural middle schools for production or experimentation. Communes in Huaiji and other counties have also allocated production bases, cattle, and farm tools to agricultural middle schools. Agricultural middle schools run by brigades receive care from the brigades in terms of farmland, housing, and school funding. At present, agricultural middle schools run by people's communes generally concentrate on food, lodging, learning, and labor at the school; agricultural middle schools run jointly by brigades mostly accept fixed tasks as a production team in the production brigade, and return to their original production team for labor during busy farming seasons; agricultural middle schools run by brigades mostly concentrate on learning and return to their original production team for production labor. Adapted to these forms, agricultural middle schools generally adopt a system of half-day classes and half-day labor or alternating-day classes, while some adopt a system of classes every three days or classes every week.

After rectification and strengthened leadership, the students in agricultural middle schools are doing well in production and have a high enthusiasm for learning. Some agricultural middle schools in Zengcheng, Chaoyang, and other counties have achieved self-sufficiency or semi-self-sufficiency. The teaching quality and academic performance of agricultural middle schools in various localities are also gradually improving.

    公社党委加强领导　因地制宜调整分布网
    广东农业中学巩固提高
    据南方日报消息　广东在去年大跃进中创办起来的农业中学，依靠人民公社的优越性，逐步巩固和提高。目前，八百多所农业中学的七万多名学生，正在一手拿锄，一手拿笔，力争读书、劳动双丰收。最近，各地经过反对不重视农民文化教育的右倾思想以后，许多地方的农业中学都陆续有了增加。
    公社化后，各地公社党委加强了对农业中学的领导，在农业中学中贯彻执行了党的教育方针，坚持了半耕半读的原则，批判了对农业中学的右倾思想和各种错误认识。潮安县的农业中学办起来以后，一些富裕农民和有资产阶级教育思想的人，对它采取怀疑、否定的态度，散播农业中学“不成学校”的论调。不少师生也受了这些思想的影响，认为农业中学“低人一等”，不安心教学和学习。各公社党委及时加强了对农业中学的领导，党委书记、党委委员到学校向师生作报告，指出农业中学前途广大，批判了对农业中学的性质、作用、前途的错误认识。以后，上课的学生人数从50％左右提高到95％以上。增城县派潭农业中学在公社化后，一些学生见到农业中学的学习条件和生活条件不够理想，认为读书不如普通中学，劳动不如生产队，要求退学。兼任正副校长的公社党委书记和大队长，一面到学校给学生上政治课，讲清农业中学的前途、性质和意义；一面帮助学校解决了一些实际问题，学生们便安心下来。
    在人民公社的统一领导、统一规划和统一安排下，各地因地制宜地调整了原有的农业中学网，使之更有利于生产和教育，克服了初办时过分分散或者过分集中的缺点。目前各地设立农业中学的形式有三种：一是公社办学，一是大队联合办学，一是大队办学。潮阳县的农业中学，是由原来的农业社创办，以后转为大队办的，因为比较分散，学生来源和师资都碰到一些困难。后来县里根据具体情况，决定由公社统一办学，使得十二个公社的农业中学都坚持了下来。一些办得较好的公社，已基本上解决了高小毕业生的升学问题。
    人民公社对农业中学的经常关怀和给予人力、物力的帮助，是保证农业中学师生能够正常学习和生活的重要条件。公社化后，各地都为农业中学配备了一批水平较高的教师，并且加强了对教师的培养工作。各地的公社和大队都拨出了一定数量的田亩，给农业中学作生产或者试验。怀集等县的公社还拨给农业中学以生产基地、耕牛、农具。由大队办的农业中学，在田亩、房屋、学校经费方面，都得到大队的关怀。现在，由人民公社举办的农业中学，一般是集中在学校食宿和学习、劳动；大队联合办的农业中学，多数作为生产大队中的一个生产队，接受固定的任务，农忙时则分散回原生产队劳动；大队办的农业中学，以集中学习、回原生产队生产劳动的居多。适应这几种形式，农业中学的上课和劳动一般采用半日上课半日劳动或隔日上课的制度，有些则采取隔三日上课或隔一周上课的制度。
    农业中学经过整顿和加强领导后，学生们生产搞的好，学习热情高。增城、潮阳等县，都有一些农业中学实现了自给或半自给。各地农业中学的教学质量和学习成绩也在逐步提高。
