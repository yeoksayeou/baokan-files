Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 24th - Encouraged by the current excellent situation, the families of workers and neighborhood women in Shanghai have put forward slogans such as "Production tasks must be completed ahead of schedule, and service work must keep up," and "We will do whatever the workers need," doing everything possible to serve the workers and support the continued leap forward in production.

Many existing neighborhood household service groups have rapidly developed and expanded, and new service groups have been established one after another. These service groups have a wide range of business items and flexible service methods, providing great convenience to workers. The service scope of the Wanyi Fang Comprehensive Service Station in Luwan District includes washing, ironing, and mending clothes, cleaning floors, emptying chamber pots, buying groceries, making hot water, tidying up rooms, taking care of the sick and postpartum women, picking up and dropping off children to school (or nurseries), making shoes, knitting wool, and more than fifty other items. The service station also has a dedicated person responsible for contacting workers and providing door-to-door service at any time. The Xinglong Street Service Group in Yulin District has set up eight contact boxes in the neighborhood, which are opened twice a day. Workers only need to write a note and drop it in the box if they need anything, and the service group staff will go to their homes to handle it. This service group also helps nearby factories and enterprises wash and mend work clothes. The Xintong Machine Factory used to add more than 400 new sets of work clothes every year. This year, thanks to the service group helping to repair the old work clothes, only a dozen sets were added. Whenever the service group staff go to the factory to collect and deliver clothes, they always carry needles and thread with them and sew up workers' clothes or fix buttons if they see them torn or missing. The service group also often visits workers door-to-door to ask them what difficulties and requests they have, and the residents' committee also holds worker forums to solicit their opinions on the service group.

In addition to working hard to run service stations and improve service businesses, residents of Hongkou and Luwan districts are also carrying out neighborhood mutual aid. Wang Suzhen, an elderly woman in her fifties in Hongkou District, voluntarily cleans rooms for a "double-income family" (both husband and wife work) every day. One day, the man in this family fell ill, and the woman was on a night shift. Wang Suzhen took the initiative to send water and food to the patient, and got up several times in the middle of the night to check on the patient and cover him with a quilt. When the woman returned, she said with emotion: "Auntie Wang, to be honest, you take care of him even more attentively than I do." Wang Suzhen also takes care of children and does housework for four other neighbors. When someone asked her why she was so enthusiastic, she said: "In the past, it was based on personal relationships, but now I understand that this is to support the leap forward in production and to realize the general line, so I must do it even better."

Neighborhood nurseries and neighborhood canteens have also taken measures to further serve the leap forward in production. The Siming Village-run Nursery in Xincheng District accepts children whenever workers bring them and has expanded its Sunday classes and increased temporary care. The nursery's caregivers also make cotton clothes and shoes for the children, and knit sweaters, so that the children's mothers can concentrate on production. The caregivers at the Jiuruli Nursery in Putuo District pay special attention to strengthening hygiene, disease prevention, and warmth, so that the children are healthy and lively, and their parents can rest assured to produce. Some of the neighborhood canteens that serve small factories and shops did not cook breakfast in the past, but now they cook breakfast and meals on Sundays. The canteen staff also deliver hot meals to night-shift workers late at night, and do everything possible to improve the quality of the food and increase the variety, to ensure that workers eat well. To allow workers to rest well, some neighborhoods put up small flags at the entrances of night-shift workers' dormitories with the words "Quiet, Night-Shift Dormitory" written on them and send people to guard them.

The enthusiastic and thoughtful service of workers' families and neighborhood residents has greatly encouraged the workers, and their enthusiasm for production is even higher. Because they are freed from the burden of housework, they can now spare more time to participate in technological innovations, cultural studies, and recreational and sports activities. Wang Xinyuan, a female worker at the Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory, has two children and an old mother-in-law. In the past, she was always busy cooking, washing clothes, serving the old, and taking care of the young after work. Because of overwork and lack of sleep, she was not in good spirits during production and often failed to complete her tasks. She also often missed factory meetings and studies. Now, thanks to the neighborhood residents and workers' families helping her arrange some housework, she has energy for production and learning. According to a recent survey by the Baoshan Neighborhood Nursery in Zhabei District, because they were freed from the burden of children and housework, thirty-one of the ninety children's mothers were rated as advanced producers or received material rewards, and all of them participated in cultural studies.

### 满腔热情为职工服务  上海职工家属和里弄妇女多方支援生产

    满腔热情为职工服务
    上海职工家属和里弄妇女多方支援生产
    新华社上海24日电　上海市的职工家属和里弄妇女，为当前的大好形势所鼓舞，她们提出：“生产任务要提前完成，服务工作要紧跟上去”，“职工需要啥我们做啥”等口号，千方百计为职工服务，支援生产继续跃进。
    许多原有的里弄家务服务组迅速地发展和扩大了，新的服务组纷纷办了起来。这些服务组业务项目繁多，服务方式灵活，给职工以很大方便。卢湾区万宜坊综合服务站的服务范围，包括洗烫缝补衣服、擦地板、倒马桶、买菜、冲开水、收拾房间、照顾病人和产妇、接送小孩上学（或托儿所）、做鞋子、编结绒线等五十多个项目。这个服务站并设专人负责同职工联系，随时登门服务。榆林区兴隆街服务组在里弄里设了八个联络箱，每天开两次，职工们要办什么事只要写一个纸条投在箱子内，服务组人员就会登门办理。这个服务组还帮助附近的工厂和企业单位洗补工作服。新通机器厂过去每年要添置四百多套新工作服，今年由于这个服务组帮助把破旧的工作服都补好，结果只添置十几套。服务组人员每次到工厂收送衣服时，总是随身携带针线，看到工人们衣服破了或钮扣掉了，就替他们缝好。服务组还经常挨门挨户访问职工，问他们有什么困难和要求，居民委员会也召开职工座谈会，征求他们对服务组的意见。
    虹口区、卢湾区的居民，除了努力办好服务站，改进服务业务以外，还开展邻里互助。虹口区五十多岁的老太太王素珍，每天主动替一家“双职工”（夫妻都参加工作）打扫房间。有一天，这家男的生病了，女的当夜班，王素珍主动为病人送水送饭，半夜里还几次起床去看望病人，为他把被子盖好。女的回来后，感动地说：“王大姐，说真心话，你照顾他比我还周到。”王素珍还为另外四家邻居带孩子、做家务活，有人问她为什么这样热心，她说：“以前是凭交情，现在我懂得这是为了支援生产跃进，为了实现总路线，所以更要好好干了。”
    里弄托儿所和里弄食堂也都采取措施，进一步为生产跃进服务。新成区四明村民办托儿所，职工什么时候送孩子来，他们就什么时候收，并扩大了星期班，增加临时性收托。这个托儿所的保育员还为孩子们做棉衣、棉鞋，编结毛衣，让孩子的妈妈集中精力搞生产。普陀区九如里托儿所的保育员特别注意加强卫生、防病、保暖工作，使孩子们健康活泼，父母安心生产。为小厂小店职工服务的里弄食堂，过去有一些是早上不烧饭的，现在早上、星期天都烧饭了。食堂职工还在深夜里把热菜热饭送到夜班职工手里，并千方百计提高饭菜质量，增加花色品种，保证职工吃好。为了让职工休息好，有些里弄在夜班工人宿舍门口插上小旗，上面写着“安静，夜班宿舍”字样，并派人护守。
    职工家属和里弄居民这样热心、周到的服务，使职工们受到很大鼓舞，他们生产积极性更高了。由于摆脱了家务牵累，现在他们还能腾出较多的时间参加技术革新、文化学习和文娱体育活动。上海矿山机器厂女工王鑫媛，家里有两个孩子，一个老婆婆，过去每天下班后，总是忙着烧饭、洗衣服，侍候老的，照顾小的。因为劳累过度，睡眠不足，生产时精神不好，经常完不成任务，厂里开会、学习也多半缺席。现在由于里弄居民和职工家属帮助她安排一些家务，她对生产和学习都有劲了。据闸北区宝山里弄托儿所最近调查，由于摆脱了孩子和家务的牵累，九十个孩子的母亲中，有三十一个被评为先进生产者或得到了物质奖励，并且全部参加了文化学习。（附图片）
