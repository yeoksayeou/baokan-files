    The Tradition of People's Life Creating Music
    Zhao Feng
    Recently, music workers and music lovers in Beijing have had the opportunity to listen to the performances of the Argentine Osvaldo Pugliese Orchestra, who came from afar. From their vibrant and Argentine folk-flavored musical performances, they can understand the musical life of ordinary people in Argentina. This is of great significance for strengthening the understanding between the people of China and Argentina.
    The reason why folk music is strong and powerful is that it reflects the lives of ordinary people, expresses people's love and hope, and shows people's lifestyles from generation to generation... Therefore, musical tradition has become a powerful thing, deeply rooted and blooming in professional music. "I only understand the tango of the slums because I was born here and will die here." This is the lyric of a song called "My Companion" sung by Argentine friends. This short poem describes the relationship between folk music and people's lives so appropriately. This makes me think of the time when I and Chinese artists visited South America and went to the slums of many cities to understand their musical life. Just like another song sung by Argentine friends describes: "I have a friend who works all day. On Saturday night, he puts on beautiful clothes and dances the tango all night." In fact, it doesn't have to wait until Saturday, and you don't have to change into beautiful clothes. In an open space, with an accordion and a six-stringed guitar or something, the girls stop washing clothes, wipe the soap off their hands, and immediately plunge into the excited or sentimental music and start dancing. It is on the basis of such ordinary people's musical life that the people's musical tradition and professional music are established. Therefore, here, "tango" is not just a dance form. We cannot limit our imagination with the "slow-fast" dance rhythm. Because the "tango" dance form here is no longer just music for accompanying dancing, it has become a national musical form, and the masses of the people and professional musicians can use this form to create songs with serious or humorous content.
    Whether it is traditional or original "tango" dance music, the strong national style and local flavor of the Osvaldo Pugliese Orchestra's performances attract every listener. Singers Jorge Maciel and Carlos Guido are very experienced and accomplished ballroom singers. They are good at using loudspeakers to bring out the characteristics of their sometimes lyrical and sentimental, sometimes passionate and exciting singing. In Jorge Maciel's performance of "Mother", when the critically ill girl misses her unfaithful lover, he successfully uses falsetto to portray a moving image.
    Monica Loynal and Toto Loy's performance of "Tango Dance" is also very moving. What is particularly interesting is that the three dance programs tell the history of "Tango Dance" - the origin of "Tango" and the classical and modern "Tango". We all know that the development of capitalism has greatly damaged and distorted folk music and dance. It is gratifying that the music and dance introduced by the friends of the Osvaldo Pugliese Orchestra have gotten rid of this abnormal influence. Here, we see an important aspect of the Argentine people's musical life—how ordinary people use music to entertain themselves and educate themselves, and how they express the beautiful or unfortunate things in life through music. It is in this ordinary people's musical life that a nation's musical tradition and style are gradually growing and forming. In this way, when you think of "Tango" and "Samba", you think of Latin America; when you think of "Polka", you think of Bohemia...

    人民的生活创造音乐的传统
    赵沨
    最近，北京的音乐工作者和音乐爱好者能有机会听到不远万里而来的阿根廷奥斯瓦尔多·普格利赛乐队的演出，并从他们的生气勃勃、充满阿根廷乡土气息的音乐演奏中，了解到阿根廷普通人民的音乐生活，这对加强中国和阿根廷人民之间的了解，是很有意义的事情。
    民间音乐之所以强烈有力，就在于它反映了普通人民的生活，倾诉了人们的爱情和希望、表现了人们世世代代的生活方式……。因而，音乐传统才变成了一个强有力的东西，根深蒂固地在专业音乐中植根开花。“只有我了解贫民区的探戈，因为我生在这里，也死在这里。”这是阿根廷朋友们演唱的一首歌曲“我的同伴”的歌词。这短短的诗句描写民间音乐和人民生活的关系实在是适当极了。这使我不禁想起我和中国艺术家们访问南美洲时，在许多城市的贫民区去了解他们的音乐生活时的情景了。正像阿根廷朋友们演唱的另一首歌曲描写的：“我有一个朋友，他整天工作，到了星期六的晚上，换上漂亮的衣服整晚跳探戈”。实际上，这不必等到星期六，也不必换漂亮衣服，在一块空地上，一个手风琴和一个六弦琴什么的乐器，姑娘们停下正在洗衣服的工作，把手上的肥皂擦掉，立即投入到兴奋的或感伤的音乐中跳起来了，就是在这样的普通人民的音乐生活的基础上，建立了人民的音乐传统和专业音乐。所以，在这里，“探戈”，已不只是一种舞曲的形式了。我们不能用“慢慢快快”的舞步节奏来范围住我们的想像。因为，“探戈”这种舞曲形式在这里已经不仅是供伴奏舞蹈的音乐了，这已经是一种民族的音乐形式，人民群众和专业音乐家都能用这种形式来创作出这些严肃的或是诙谐的内容的歌曲。
    奥斯瓦尔多·普格利赛乐队演奏的无论是传统的或是创作的“探戈”舞曲，强烈的民族风格和乡土气息吸引着每一个听众。歌唱家乔治·马西耶利和卡尔洛斯·基多是很有经验和修养的舞会歌唱家，他们很会使用扬声器来发挥他们那种时而抒情、感伤，时而热情、激动的歌唱的特点。乔治·马西耶利表演的“母亲”，当病危的姑娘怀念变心的情人时，他成功地使用假声唱法来刻划出动人的形象。
    莫尼卡·洛依纳尔和托托·罗依表演的“探戈舞”也是很动人的。特别有趣的是三个舞蹈节目讲述了“探戈舞”的历史——“探戈”的起源和古典的、现代的“探戈”。我们都知道，资本主义的发展使民间音乐和舞蹈受到很大的破坏和歪曲，可喜的是，奥斯瓦尔多·普格利赛乐队的朋友们介绍的音乐和舞蹈，都摆脱了这种不正常的影响。在这里，我们看到了阿根廷人民音乐生活的重要的一面——普通人民是如何用音乐娱乐自己并教育自己，在音乐中诉说出生活中美好的或是不幸的生活，就在这种普通人民的音乐生活中，一个民族的音乐传统、风格在逐步成长和形成。就这样，一想起“探戈”和“桑巴”，便使人想起拉丁美洲；一想到“波尔卡”，便想到波希米亚……。
