The Current Situation in Puerto Rico

Editor's Note: On October 10th, the British "World News" published an article written by Enna Murado Guista, a Puerto Rican author. An excerpt is translated below:

American Atomic Base

The colonial government of Puerto Rico is headed by Muñoz Marín. Under the condition that the Marín government maintain strict silence on military matters, Washington allows him to make some improvements in social welfare, labor legislation, and education using Puerto Rico's own funds and "federal" American financial aid. However, the military figures are quite substantial. Now, as the easternmost "defense" station of the North American continent, Puerto Rico has become a launching pad for atomic attacks on Central Europe, and therefore, it is bound to be a primary target in any war.

On the eastern coast of Puerto Rico, near the deep-water port of Ensenada Honda, a base for nuclear submarines, there is a missile base. On the west coast of Puerto Rico, there is the Ramey Air Force Base. Although not publicly announced, this airport is very likely equipped with nuclear weapons. In all aspects other than purely domestic affairs, the commander of the troops stationed in the Antilles and the admiral commanding the Caribbean fleet are the true government of Puerto Rico. They can take over any area of Puerto Rico at will, as long as they deem it necessary for military training exercises.

Forced Implementation of U.S. Laws

The U.S. compulsory conscription law is implemented throughout Puerto Rico. Those who refuse military service are sentenced to long-term imprisonment or deportation. Imprisonment is carried out in "federal" prisons on the mainland.

The "federal" tariff law, immigration law, navigation law, and public land law are fully implemented in Puerto Rico. The so-called tariff "protection" law actually forces Puerto Rico to trade only with the United States. Puerto Rico's business relations with other countries are negligible. Maritime and air transportation between Puerto Rico and the United States is completely monopolized by the United States. Ships and airplanes from other countries are not allowed to carry passengers or goods between Puerto Rico and the American continent. This makes Puerto Rico's livelihood dependent on the American market. Puerto Rico's export commodities, such as cane sugar, molasses, fruit, and knitwear, are also completely controlled by American monopoly groups. As a result, the American export market controls the prices of Puerto Rico's grain, machinery, and medicine. Except for coffee, sugar, vegetables, and limited production of meat and dairy products, virtually all of Puerto Rico's consumer goods are controlled by Americans. On the other hand, American monopoly groups also stipulate the prices of Puerto Rican goods exported to the United States.

Land Ownership

The U.S. government controls Puerto Rico's foreign relations. Puerto Rico has no diplomatic or business relations with other countries. Through passport regulations, Americans also control Puerto Ricans' foreign travel.

Land ownership in Puerto Rico has always been in the hands of American enterprises. Although the law stipulates that an enterprise cannot own more than five hundred acres of land, American enterprises have evaded the law by distributing the land under different names.

In terms of jurisdiction, according to past civil and criminal laws, municipal, county, and provincial courts in Puerto Rico have certain judicial procedures. However, all cases (including those in police court) are prosecuted not in the name of the Puerto Rican people but in the name of the U.S. President. In fact, the U.S. President is the sole head of Puerto Rico.

Population and Unemployment

Puerto Rico has a population of about three million, with another million people having migrated to the American continent. On average, the population density is over six hundred people per square mile. Puerto Rico has a very high population density in the world. Among the three million people, more than 600,000 are in the labor force, mainly agricultural laborers. During the busy farming season, weekly wages are about fifteen to twenty U.S. dollars. During the off-season, more than half of the labor force is unemployed, and their income is less than five U.S. dollars a week in unemployment benefits. Unemployment is a constant phenomenon in Puerto Rico, and sometimes the number of unemployed accounts for one-third of the total labor force. During the fruit and vegetable harvest seasons, many unemployed people go to the mainland to seek seasonal work.

Workers' Movement and Political Parties

Puerto Rico's labor organizations are completely controlled by the government, with government puppets serving as leaders. The American AFL-CIO is organizing Puerto Rican unions that are not controlled by the government. The AFL-CIO organizers are striving to colonize Puerto Rico's labor unions.

Past strike events in Puerto Rico have often resulted in bloody tragedies. The police always support the capitalists.

The Nationalist Party, which launched an armed uprising in 1950, is small in number but quite influential, and it has now been virtually disbanded. It still enjoys considerable sympathy among young people and patriots.

Nationalist Party leader Campos is currently serving a sentence in an American prison (a 60-year prison term). Campos is 70 years old and has no hope of ever being released. Fifty other people who were arrested and imprisoned with Campos and sentenced to life imprisonment.

The Communist Party of Puerto Rico, like the Nationalist Party, has suffered cruel persecution. However, the Communist Party of Puerto Rico still has considerable influence, and it always issues its relevant statements when the situation requires it.

### 波多黎各现况

专栏：外论摘要

    波多黎各现况
    编者按：10月10日英国“世界新闻”发表了一篇波多黎各作者恩纳穆拉多·居伊斯塔所写的一篇文章，摘译如下：
    美国原子基地
    波多黎各的殖民地政府是以穆尼奥斯·马林为首的。在马林政府对军备问题严守沉默的条件下，华盛顿允许他用波多黎各自己的经费和“联邦”的美国财政援助，在社会福利、劳工立法、教育方面作出一些改良的措施，但是，军备数字却是十分可观的。现在，作为北美大陆极东“防御”站的波多黎各，已经变成对中欧发动原子攻击的阵地，因此，在任何战争中它必然是一个当头的目标。
    在波多黎各东部海岸，邻近原子潜艇基地深水港埃森纳达·宏达，有一个导弹基地。在波多黎各西岸有空军基地拉梅机场。虽然没有公开宣布，不过，这个机场很有可能配备着核武器。除了纯粹的内政事务以外，无论从哪方面说来，驻扎于安的列斯群岛的部队的司令官和指挥加勒比海舰队的海军上将是波多黎各的真正的政府。只要他们认为合于军事训练演习的需要，他们就可以随心所欲地接管波多黎各的任何地区。
    强迫实施美国法律
    波多黎各全岛实施着美国的强迫征兵法。拒绝服兵役的被判长期监禁或驱逐出境。监禁是在大陆上的“联邦”监狱中执行的。
    波多黎各全面实施着“联邦”关税法、移民法、航海法、公用土地法。所谓关税“保护”法，实际上迫使波多黎各只能与美国进行贸易，波多黎各与其他国家的商务关系微不足道。波多黎各与美国之间的海、空交通运输完全由美国所垄断，其他国家的轮船、飞机均不得载运客货往来波多黎各与美洲大陆之间。这样就使波多黎各的生计仰赖于美国市场。波多黎各的出口商品蔗糖、糖蜜、水果、针织品也完全由美国垄断集团所控制。结果，美国的出口市场控制了波多黎各的粮食、机器、药品的价格。除了咖啡、糖、蔬菜以及产量有限的肉类和奶制品以外，波多黎各的一切消费品实际上都由美国人控制。在另一方面，美国垄断集团也规定波多黎各输美的商品的价格。
    土地所有权
    美国政府控制了波多黎各的对外关系。波多黎各与其他国家没有外交、商务的关系。通过护照条例，美国人也控制了波多黎各人的国外旅行。
    波多黎各土地所有权一直掌握在美国企业的手里。虽然法律规定一个企业拥有的土地不得超过五百英亩，但是美国企业用化名分散的办法，逃避了法律的规定。
    在司法上，根据过去的民法和刑法，波多黎各的市级、县级、省级法院都有一定的司法程序。但是，一切案件（连警察法庭的案件在内）都不是用波多黎各人民的名义而是用美国总统的名义提审的，实际上，美国总统是波多黎各的唯一的元首。
    人口与失业
    波多黎各人口约三百万，另有一百万人移居美洲大陆。平均算来，每平方哩人口在六百名以上。在世界上，波多黎各人口密度是很高的。在三百万人口中，六十多万人是有劳动力的人口，其中主要的是农业劳动力——在农忙季节，每周工资约为十五美元至二十美元。在农闲季节半数以上的劳动力没有工作，他们的收入是每周不到五美元的失业救济金。波多黎各经常存在失业现象，有时全年失业人数占全部劳动力三分之一。在水果和蔬菜收获季节，许多失业的人前往大陆觅求季节性的工作。
    工人运动和政党
    波多黎各的工人组织完全由政府控制，由政府的傀儡充当领导人。美国的劳联—产联正在把波多黎各的未受政府控制的工会组织起来。劳联—产联的组织者正在力求把波多黎各的工会殖民地化。
    波多黎各过去的罢工事件往往造成流血惨剧。警察总是支持资本家。
    1950年发动武装起义的国民党，人数不多，但是颇有势力，现在实际上已经被解散了。在青年与爱国人士中间它仍拥有相当的同情。
    国民党领袖坎波斯目前仍在美国监狱服刑（有期徒刑六十年）。坎波斯现年七十，已无活着出狱的希望。与坎波斯同时被捕下狱、被判处无期徒刑的尚有五十人。
    波多黎各共产党与国民党一样，都遭受了残酷的迫害。但波多黎各共产党仍有相当的影响，它在情况需要的时候，总是发表它的有关的声明。
