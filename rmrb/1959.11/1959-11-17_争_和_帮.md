    "Striving" and "Helping"

    The nationwide, vigorously developing socialist labor competition has already entered a new stage, namely, the stage of significantly expanding the advanced front. In the Shanghai textile system, over 70% of female weaving workers have reached the level of skilled workers. In the Shaanxi Textile Factory, the number of advanced production groups capable of comprehensively and balancedly fulfilling the state plan has increased from 60% to 80%. This reflects the situation of expanding the advanced front, which is rapidly developing on the textile industry front.

    One of the characteristics of socialist labor competition is to take the advanced as a model and strive to catch up and surpass them. Fast hands are the models for slow hands, and skilled hands are the models for fast hands. When slow hands catch up with fast hands, and then surpass fast hands to catch up with skilled hands, while the original fast hands catch up with skilled hands and surpass them, the labor competition will develop vigorously. Another characteristic of socialist labor competition is to take the advanced as the backbone and help all backward ones reach the advanced level. That is to say, those who have already reached the level of fast hands and skilled hands have the responsibility to help some slow hands improve rapidly in terms of ideology and operational skills. In this way, on the one hand, actively "striving," and on the other hand, actively "helping," combining "striving" and "helping," the social production level will increase substantially.

    “争”和“帮”
    举国上下蓬勃开展的社会主义劳动竞赛，已经跨进了一个新的阶段，这就是大幅度扩大先进面的阶段。上海纺织系统有70％以上的挡车女工达到能手水平；陕西纺织厂能够全面均衡完成国家计划的先进生产小组已经由60％扩大到80％。这反映了扩大先进面的形势，在纺织工业战线上正在迅速发展。
    社会主义劳动竞赛的特色之一，是以先进为标兵，力争上游赶上去。快手是慢手的标兵，能手又是快手的标兵。慢手赶上了快手，继而超过快手赶上能手，同时原来的快手赶上了能手，并超过了能手，劳动竞赛就会轰轰烈烈地开展起来。社会主义劳动竞赛还有另一个特色：以先进为骨干，帮助所有后进达到先进的地步。这就是说，已经达到快手、能手水平的人有责任从思想上和操作技术上帮助某些慢手迅速提高。这样，一方面主动地去“争”，一方面主动地去“帮”，“争”和“帮”结合起来，社会的生产水平才会大幅度的增长。
