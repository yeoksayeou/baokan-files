Xinhua News Agency, Kunming: Thirty counties (cities) in Yunnan Province's major spring crop production areas, including Kunming, Yiliang, Yuxi, and Dali, have launched a competition to strive for a large-scale increase in spring crop production next year. These thirty counties (cities) started a vigorous production competition when they began sowing spring crops this winter. In the sowing and field management work, the participating counties and cities conscientiously summarized and promoted the experience of local and other regions in increasing spring crop production, and actively implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural increase. Leaders at all levels engaged in experimental fields, high-yield demonstration fields, and command fields, and rationally arranged the varieties of spring crops according to different natural conditions. After more than a month of hard work, these counties (cities) have sown more than 9.5 million mu of spring crops, of which high-yield demonstration fields account for about 30%.

After the wheat sowing work was basically completed, these thirty counties and cities began mutual inspection work. In addition to the planting area, season, measures, varieties, and quality, the inspection also focused on the sowing quality, varieties, production targets, and field management measures of about 30% of the large-area high-yield demonstration fields and command fields, as well as the prevention and control of pests and diseases. The inspection method adopted a combination of general inspection and key inspection, and combined with holding on-site meetings to exchange and promote experience on the spot. Through inspection, the quality of spring crop field management in these counties and cities has greatly improved.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei: The four million-strong labor force in the Huaibei Plain of Anhui Province formed a professional wheat field management team to carry out seedling inspection and replanting, topdressing, and other work in the rain and snow.

This year, there has been particularly little rainfall in Huaibei, Anhui, and most of the more than 26 million mu of wheat sown in autumn was irrigated and sown with water. Since the beginning of November, the Huaibei area has experienced continuous rainfall and snowfall. On the night of the rain, tens of thousands of people in Xiaoxian County fought in the rain. In less than a week, all the more than 105,000 mu of wheat in the county that had missing seedlings and broken ridges were checked and replanted. In order to eliminate the missing seedlings and broken ridges of wheat caused by drought, Funan County comprehensively adopted effective measures such as spot seeding, replanting, transplanting, intercropping, and topdressing after rain and snow, achieving full and vigorous seedlings. While replanting and topdressing, various places also promptly carried out pest and disease prevention and control work.

The large-scale field management campaign after rain and snow in Huaibei has achieved significant results. After checking seedlings and replanting, the more than 26 million mu of wheat have basically eliminated the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges, and 5 million mu have been topdressed, with each mu receiving about 100 dan of fertilizer. Now, the wheat in the Huaibei Plain is a lush green. (Attached picture)

    云南检查小春田间管理质量  淮北趁雨补种保证小麦全苗
    据新华社昆明讯　云南省小春作物主要产区的昆明、宜良、玉溪、大理等三十个县（市）开展了争取明年小春作物大面积增产的竞赛。这三十个县（市）今冬在开始播种小春作物的时候，便开展了热火朝天的生产竞赛。在播种和田间管理工作中，参加竞赛的县市，都认真总结和推广了本地和外地小春作物增产的经验，积极贯彻了农业增产“八字宪法”。各级领导都大搞试验田、高额丰产田和指挥田，并依据不同的自然条件，合理地安排了小春作物的品种。经过一个多月的苦战，这些县（市）已播种小春作物九百五十多万亩，其中高额丰产田占30％左右。
    小麦播种工作基本结束后，这三十个县市就开始了互相检查工作。检查的内容除种植面积、节令、措施、品种、质量以外，还着重检查30％左右的大面积高额丰产田、指挥田的播种质量、品种、生产指标和田间管理的各项措施以及防治病虫害等工作。检查的方法采取一般检查与重点检查相结合，并且结合召开现场会议，就地交流推广经验。通过检查，这些县市的小春作物田间管理工作，质量都有很大提高。
    据新华社合肥讯　安徽省淮北平原四百万劳动大军组成的小麦田间管理专业队，冒着雨雪进行查苗补苗、追肥等工作。
    安徽淮北各地今年雨水特别稀少，秋种的二千六百多万亩小麦大半是采取灌水润田、带水播种。从11月初，淮北地区连续降雨下雪，萧县在下雨的当晚，就有十几万人冒雨奋战，不到一星期，全县十万五千多亩发生缺苗断垅的小麦就全部查、补结束。阜南县为消灭因干旱而发生的小麦缺苗断垅，在雨雪后全面采取点种、补种、移栽、套种、追肥等有效措施，达到了苗全苗旺。各地在补苗、追肥的同时还及时开展了防治病虫害工作。
    淮北各地大抓雨雪后的田间管理运动，已经取得了重大成就。二千六百多万亩小麦经过查苗补苗，基本消灭了缺苗断垅现象，并且有五百万亩已追了肥，每亩追肥都在一百担左右。现在，淮北平原小麦是一片葱绿。（附图片）
