Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 22nd. The Jinxi Machine Factory has adopted the "one-dragon" material usage method to vigorously save raw materials. The effective utilization rate of the factory's main raw materials, steel plates and silicon steel sheets, has increased from 70% to over 90%. The value of scrap and surplus materials saved in a month amounts to 90,000 yuan. By overcoming the difficulties of insufficient raw materials, this factory has comprehensively overfulfilled this year's national plan fifty-three days ahead of schedule.

The "one-dragon" material usage method involves supplying waste, scrap, and offcut materials from the production of Product A to Product B as raw materials; waste and offcut materials from the production of Product B are then supplied to Product C as raw materials; this process continues layer by layer until all materials are used. This is a material-saving method that makes the most of every resource. This advanced material usage method was created by the Su Yanming team in the factory's Workshop Six. In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, they put forward the slogan "Use small when possible, use short when possible, use instead of wasting, substitute instead of requisitioning," and rationally arranged the material usage of twenty-seven categories and seventy types of products. They compared them one by one to see which small parts could be made from the surplus materials of larger parts, and which even smaller parts could be made from scrap and waste materials. When cutting materials, they first cut off the surplus materials, ensuring that the scrap materials were in blocks and the surplus materials were usable. This achieved large materials nesting small materials, scrap materials substituting good materials, and making the most of everything. For example, a steel plate measuring 2,200 mm long, 900 mm wide, and 2 mm thick could previously only cut fifty-five "2314" model bearing cages, and the rest would become waste. Now, in addition to making fifty-five "2314" model bearing cages, the remaining inner circle surplus material is also used to make fifty-five "310" model bearing cages and various standard washers. Then, the scrap material remaining from making the "310" bearing cages is used to make two electric motor covers, and the remaining offcuts are used to make many spring pins. In this way, the steel plate utilization rate of the Su Yanming team increased from 50% to over 90%. Since the second quarter, they have successively saved more than 2,000 steel plates and used waste, scrap, surplus, and offcut materials to make more than one million product parts. Moreover, they have overfulfilled their plans every month and entered 1960 ahead of schedule in July this year.

After the factory Party committee discovered and studied the "one-dragon" material usage method of the Su Yanming team, they believed that this was an important experience for further developing the increase production and practice economy movement. Therefore, in early October, they promptly convened an on-site promotion meeting to promote this experience. After the meeting, various workshops and teams immediately launched a wave of learning from and catching up with the Su Yanming team. "Rationally use good and usable materials, fully utilize scrap and surplus materials; practice careful calculation, substitute instead of requisitioning" has become the action slogan of the factory's increase production and practice economy movement. After an on-site visit, the Thirteenth Workshop, based on the actual situation of the workshop, conscientiously formulated a rational material usage plan and comprehensively promoted the "one-dragon" material usage method. In October, they used scrap, surplus, and waste materials to manufacture 157 electric motor stators, saving the country 37 tons of silicon steel sheets and 1,400 square meters of yellow wax cloth.

After the "one-dragon" material usage method was universally promoted throughout the factory, the boundaries between teams, sections, and workshops have been broken in material usage. The "one-dragon" of the team has become the "one-dragon" of the entire factory. Under the condition of ensuring product quality, the factory has now formed five "dragons" for the factory's valuable and largest-used silicon steel sheets, 2-4mm steel plates, seamless steel pipes, copper, and thick steel plates above 4mm respectively. For example, silicon steel sheets are first used by the Thirteenth Workshop to make large and medium-sized electric motors. The remaining surplus material is supplied to the Fifth Workshop as raw materials for manufacturing small electric motors. Then, the remaining surplus material from manufacturing small electric motors is supplied to satellite factories as raw materials for making small transformers. Finally, the remaining scrap and waste materials are uniformly handed over to the factory's supply and marketing section's waste product warehouse and transferred to brother factories for use. In this way, the utilization rate of silicon steel sheets has increased from the original 75% to 92%.

Xinhua News Agency, Lüda. The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory has adopted the method of combining cadres, technicians, and workers in cutting materials, saving 844 tons of steel in the first nine months of this year. The metal structure workshop, which consumes the most steel, has gradually increased its steel utilization rate from 97% in the past to 100% due to the joint determination of cutting materials by cadres, technicians, and workers. In the production of oil tank cars alone, 150 tons of steel were saved.

In saving steel, this factory strengthened five management systems, including rational nesting and cutting, and waste product recovery and utilization, to avoid using large materials for small purposes and promote the rational use of scrap and offcut materials. The shear workshop now has fifteen types of components that are all produced using waste materials. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has also implemented more than 300 renovation proposals related to saving steel, which has powerfully promoted the development of steel-saving work.

    充分利用成材边材
    晋西机器厂合理下料节约九万元
    大连车辆厂一车间钢材利用率达到100％
    新华社太原22日电　晋西机器厂采用“一条龙”用料的办法，大力节约原料、材料，全厂主要原材料钢板和矽钢片的有效利用率，已由70％提高到90％以上，一个月当中节约的边料、余料价值就达九万元。由于克服了原料、材料不足的困难，这个工厂已经提前五十三天全面超额完成了今年的国家计划。
    “一条龙”用料法，就是把做甲种产品剩余的废料、边料、下脚料，供给乙种产品作为原料或材料；做乙种产品剩余的废料、下脚料，又供给丙种产品作为原料；如此层层往下推，一直到用完。这是一个物尽其用的节约用料办法。这一先进用料法是这个厂六车间苏炎明小组创造的。他们为了克服原料、材科不足的困难，提出了“能小不大，能短不长，能用不废，能代不领”的口号，把二十七类、七十种产品的用料情况，合理地排了队，一件一件地进行对照，看哪种小零件可以用做大零件时剩下的余料来做，哪种更小的零件可以用边料、废料来做。在下料的时候，先裁下余料，保证边料成块，余料成材。做到大料套小料，边料代好料，物尽其用。如此一张长二千二百毫米、宽九百毫米、厚二毫米的钢板，过去只能裁五十五个“二三一四”型号的轴承保持架、剩下的就成了废料；现在，除做五十五个“二三一四”型号轴承保持架外，还把剩下的内圆余料又做成五十五个“三一○”型号的轴承保持架和各种标准垫圈；然后，再把做“三一○”型轴承保持架剩余的边料，做成两个电动机风罩，把剩余的脚料做成许多簧肖。就这样，苏炎明小组的钢板利用率由50％提高到90％以上，二季度以来，先后节约了两千多张钢板，利用废料、边料、余料、下脚料做成了一百多万件产品零件。而且，月月超额完成计划，早在今年7月份就提前跨进了1960年。
    厂党委发现和研究了苏炎明小组的“一条龙”用料法之后，认为这是进一步开展增产节约运动的一条重要经验，因此在10月初及时召开推广这一经验的现场促进会。会后，各车间、小组立即掀起学苏炎明小组、赶苏炎明小组的热潮。“成材好料合理使用，边料余料充分利用；精打细算能代不领”，成为全厂职工增产节约运动的行动口号。十三车间经过现场参观后，根据本车间实际情况，认真制定了合理用料计划，全面推广了“一条龙”用料法。10月份就利用边料、余料、废料制作了一百五十七台电机锭子，为国家节约了三十七吨矽钢片和一千四百平方米黄腊布。
    “一条龙”用料法在全厂普遍推广后，在用料中已经打破了小组、工段、车间的界限，由小组“一条龙”变成了全厂“一条龙”。在保证产品质量的条件下，这个工厂现在已将全厂贵重的、用量最大的矽钢片、二至四毫米钢板、无缝钢管、铜、四毫米以上的厚钢板等，分别组成了五条“大龙”。如矽钢片，先由十三车间做大、中型电动机，剩下的余料供给五车间作为制造小电动机的原料，然后再把制造小型电动机的余料供给卫星工厂作为制作小变压器的原料，最后剩下的边料、废料统一交给厂供销科废品库，调给兄弟厂使用。这样，矽钢片利用率由原来的75％提高到92％。
    新华社旅大电　大连机车车辆厂采取干部、技术人员、工人三结合下料的办法，今年头九个月节约了八百四十四吨钢材。耗用钢材最多的金属结构车间，由于干部、技术人员和工人共同确定下料，钢材利用率由过去97％逐步提高到100％。仅在油槽车一项生产任务中，就节约了一百五十吨钢材。
    在节约钢材中，这个厂加强了合理套裁、废品回收利用等五项管理制度，避免了大材小用，促进了边角余料的合理运用。剪刀工段现在已有十五种部件全部利用废料生产。今年以来全厂还实现了三百多件有关节约钢材的革新建议，有力地推动了节约钢材工作的开展。（附图片）
