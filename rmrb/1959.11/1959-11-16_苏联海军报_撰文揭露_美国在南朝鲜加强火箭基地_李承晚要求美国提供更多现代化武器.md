Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 15th. The "Soviet Naval Gazette" today published an article by Ivanov. The article listed many facts proving that the United States is striving to maintain and strengthen its military strategic bases in the Far East, especially the establishment of military bases in South Korea.

    Referring to measures in this regard, the article specifically traced back to July 1957, when the United States shipped rocket weapons to South Korea in addition to general weapons.

    The article pointed out that from the date of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement to the end of February this year, the United States and the Syngman Rhee army have created nearly a thousand provocative incidents in the demilitarized zone and in the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Military aircraft have violated the airspace of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea nearly two thousand times. The South Korean war clique, especially the Syngman Rhee puppet, is trying to incite war frenzy. They are frantically clamoring for a "Northern Expedition."

    Therefore, the article pointed out that the removal of the US military bases in South Korea is of great significance to peace in the Far East and the world. The Soviet people, along with other peace-loving countries, resolutely support the just demands of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and the removal of rocket-atomic bases there.

    Xinhua News Agency: In a written reply to questions raised by the Associated Press on the 11th, Syngman Rhee openly suggested that South Korea be built into a major missile base to serve as the vanguard of US aggression in Asia.

    Regardless of the constraints of the Korean Armistice Agreement, Syngman Rhee emphasized that the United States should give him more modern weapons. He said: "If new and more powerful missile bases are established in Korea, and if these weapons help end communist aggression, then we need them and will use them in accordance with our training and in accordance with the policies of our allies."

    Syngman Rhee also clamored for the conclusion of a "more effective" anti-communist military treaty in Asia.

    Recently, senior US military officials have been active in South Korea one after another. On the same day that US Pacific Area Armed Forces Commander Felt left Seoul, US Assistant Secretary of the Navy Juehlne arrived in Busan on the 11th. During his stay in South Korea, Felt held talks with senior US and Syngman Rhee military and civilian officials and visited frontline military equipment.

    “苏联海军报”撰文揭露
    美国在南朝鲜加强火箭基地
    李承晚要求美国提供更多现代化武器
    新华社莫斯科15日电　“苏联海军报”今天发表了伊凡诺夫的一篇文章。文章中列举了许多事实证明：美国竭力保持和加强它在远东的军事战略基地，特别是在南朝鲜建立军事基地。
    在谈到关于这方面的措施时，文章特别追述说，1957年7月，除了一般的武器以外，美国还往南朝鲜运进了火箭武器。
    文章指出，自朝鲜停战协定签字之日起到今年2月底为止，美国和李承晚军队在非军事化地区以及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领水内制造了近一千起挑衅事件。军用飞机侵犯朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领空近两千次。南朝鲜的好战集团，特别是李承晚傀儡企图煽起战争狂。他们正在疯狂地叫嚣“北进”。
    因此，文章指出，撤除美国在南朝鲜的军事基地，对远东以及全世界的和平具有重大的意义。苏联人民和其他爱好和平的各国人民一道，坚决支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国关于从南朝鲜撤退美国军队和撤除在那里的火箭—原子基地的正义要求。
    据新华社讯　李承晚11日在书面答复美联社提出的问题时，公然建议把南朝鲜建成一个主要的导弹基地，来充当美国在亚洲进行侵略的先锋。
    李承晚不顾朝鲜停战协定的约束，强调要美国给他更多的现代化武器。他说：“如果在朝鲜建立新的更加有力的导弹基地，如果这些武器有助于结束共产党侵略的话，那么我们就需要它们，并且将根据所受的训练和在符合我们的盟国的政策的情况下使用它们”。
    李承晚还叫嚷在亚洲缔结一个“更有效的”反共军事条约。
    最近，美国高级军事官员接连到南朝鲜活动。在美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特离开汉城的同一天，美国海军助理部长朱尔恩又在11日到达釜山。费耳特在南朝鲜时曾经同美国和李承晚的高级文武官员举行会谈，并且参观了前线的军事设备。
