Xinhua News Agency, Athens, November 7th: According to a TASS report from Athens on November 6th, the Athens Criminal Court continues to try "Avgi" (Dawn) newspaper and its publisher, Manolis Glezos.

Glezos defended the newspaper in court on the 6th, exposing the political nature of the trial. He pointed out that the Greek authorities are attempting to put "Avgi" on trial because of its firm political stance. The persecution of Greek citizens for their democratic beliefs is a true violation of the law and the constitution. Glezos cited specific examples of Greek authorities imprisoning and exiling democrats without investigation or trial.

Glezos said that the authorities have violated freedom of the press, freedom of association, and interfered in trade union affairs.

Glezos emphasized that our newspaper speaks for the people, and it has the right to supervise and criticize the government's actions. We believe that our criticism is in line with the interests of the nation. I believe that the duty of the judiciary is to protect the freedom of the press from the encroachment of the authorities.

Witnesses for the defense also spoke in court, demanding an end to the persecution of "Avgi" and Glezos. They protested the authorities' attack on freedom of the press and persecution of democrats.

    义正词严为“黎明日报”辩护
    格列索斯斥责希腊当局践踏民主
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社雅典6日讯：雅典刑事法庭继续审讯“黎明日报”和该报社长曼诺利斯·格列索斯。
    格列索斯6日在法庭上为报纸辩护时揭露了这次审讯的政治性质。他指出，希腊当局企图为“黎明日报”的坚定的政治主张而使该报受到审判。当局因希腊公民的民主信仰而迫害他们，这是对法律和宪法的真正的侵犯。格列索斯举出了具体的例子说明希腊当局不经过调查和审判就把民主人士关进监狱和流放。
    格列索斯说，当局侵犯了出版自由、结社自由，干涉工会的事务。
    格列索斯着重指出，我们的报纸代表人民说话，它有权利监督和批评政府的行动。我们认为，我们的批评是符合于民族的利益的。我认为，司法的职责在于保护出版自由，不受当局的侵犯。
    在法庭上发言的还有辩护证人，他们要求停止迫害“黎明日报”和格列索斯。他们抗议当局进攻出版自由、迫害民主人士。
