　　It was past eight o'clock in the evening. The old hero Meng Tai was chatting with two other representatives from his factory, Zhan Jiangong and Jie Minggui, when hurried footsteps sounded in the corridor. The door opened, and a strong man, his chest covered with medals, walked in.

　　"Master Li, you really came!" Old Meng Tai quickly stood up to greet him.

　　"I'm back to my mother's home to visit relatives, borrowing the east wind!" The guest said with a smile as soon as he entered. He was Li Feng'en, the chief furnace technician and advanced producer of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Works. He had worked with Old Meng Tai since the puppet Manchukuo era until 1957 when he was transferred from Anshan Iron and Steel to Wuhan Iron and Steel. Hearing this, Old Meng Tai also jokingly said, "I hope that all the 'daughters' that Anshan Iron and Steel has 'married off' can be like you, making contributions in their husband's home and visiting relatives in Beijing… But, we don't have any east wind to lend you!"

　　"Brother Meng, you can't be conservative! If Wuhan Iron and Steel falls behind, Anshan Iron and Steel will also lose face!" Li Feng'en said deliberately solemnly. At this, Old Meng Tai also pretended to be angry, as if acting in a play, and said, "What Anshan Iron and Steel, what Wuhan Iron and Steel, there is only one 'steel' in the country, and we must ensure that this 'big steel' continues to leap forward!" Everyone was amused by this dramatic dialogue and deeply understood the weight of Old Meng Tai's words.

　　At this moment, Li Feng'en took out his small notebook and seriously "sought advice": "Master Meng, Master Zhan, the blast furnaces in Anshan produce iron eight or nine times a day, but in Wuhan, sometimes we can't even get seven times?" Then, Zhan Jiangong explained the quick iron-tapping method in detail. Li Feng'en also wrote it down verbatim.

　　Unknowingly, the clock hand pointed to ten o'clock. At this time, Li Feng'en reluctantly stood up, ready to say goodbye. Old Meng Tai and Zhan Jiangong held Li Feng'en's hand: "Master Li, the No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces in Wuhan Iron and Steel are similar in size to our No. 10 blast furnace, and the degree of mechanization and automation is also similar. Shall we compete with each other?"

　　"Yes, and let's include Baotou Iron and Steel's No. 1 furnace as well!" Li Feng'en agreed happily. "Yes, include it too."...

    李凤恩向老战友取经
    老孟泰给新基地送宝
    晚上八点多钟。老英雄孟泰正和本厂的另外的两位代表詹建功、解明贵坐在一起聊天，走廊里传来了一阵急促的脚步声。门开处，一位身体健壮、胸前挂满奖章的人走了进来。
    “李师傅，你可真来啦！”老孟泰连忙立起来，迎了上去。
    “我是回娘家探亲人，借东风来啦！”客人一进门，就笑着说。他是武钢炼铁厂的炉前总技师、先进生产者李凤恩。从伪满时代，他就和老孟泰在一起干活，直到1957年，他才从鞍钢调到武钢。老孟泰一听，也诙谐地说：“我希望鞍钢嫁出去的‘姑娘’都能像你一样，在婆家立功，到北京探亲……不过，我们可没有什么东风借给你呀！”
    “孟大哥，你可不能保守啊！武钢落后了，鞍钢的脸上也不好看哩！”李凤恩故意装作郑重地说。这一来，老孟泰也像演戏一样，装作一副生气的样子说：“什么鞍钢的，武钢的，全国只有一个‘钢’，我们要保住这个‘大钢’不断跃进才对！”大家都被这段戏剧性的对话逗乐了，也深深体会到老孟泰这句话份量。
    这时，李凤恩从兜里掏出了小本子，郑重其事地“取经”了：“孟师傅，詹师傅，鞍钢的高炉一天出八、九次铁，武钢有时连七次也出不来？”接着，詹建功便一五一十地介绍起快速出铁法来。李凤恩也一字不漏地记了下来。
    时针不知不觉指到十点了。这时，李凤恩才依依不舍地站了起来，准备告辞。老孟泰、詹建功拉着李凤恩的手：“李师傅，武钢一、二号高炉和我们十号高炉大小相仿，机械化、自动化程度上也差不多，我们互相赛一赛吧？”
    “对，还有包钢一号炉，也算上！”李凤恩欣然同意说。“对，也算上。”……
