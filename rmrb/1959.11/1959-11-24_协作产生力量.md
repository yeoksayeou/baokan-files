    Collaboration Generates Strength
    Yi Qin
    “Three people with one heart, yellow earth turns into gold,” is an old Chinese saying. In modern terms, this means: "Collaboration generates strength." After reading the news that Longshan, Laifeng, and Xuan'en counties are launching comprehensive collaboration to further promote industrial and agricultural production, I am even more convinced of the correctness of these words. Now, it is no longer simply "three people with one heart," but rather expanded to become three counties with one heart. The spirit of collaboration among the people of the three counties has added infinite strength to the socialist construction in that region.
    Longshan County is a border county in Hunan Province, and Laifeng and Xuan'en counties are border counties in Hubei Province. Although they belong to two different provinces, they have broken through the boundaries between counties and provinces and established a collaborative relationship of mutual support and mutual exchange. Look! Longshan County is going to build a reservoir, and Laifeng and Xuan'en counties believe this is a great joy for the people of Longshan County. Adhering to the principle of sacrificing small interests for the sake of greater interests, they fully support it. They immediately made proper arrangements for the rice paddies and resettlement work in their regions that would be flooded by the reservoir, and sent technicians to help Longshan County draft construction plans. After the reservoir construction started, the masses of Laifeng and Xuan'en counties voluntarily supported a large amount of equipment. Look again! In 1957, Laifeng County tried planting double-cropping rice, but the yield was not high due to the poor variety of early rice. Last year, in order to help Laifeng County increase the yield of double-cropping rice and achieve a common leap forward, Longshan County, even though its own improved varieties were insufficient, still allocated more than 130,000 jin of early rice varieties with early maturity and high yield to support Laifeng County. Many experienced cadres and farmers in Longshan also voluntarily went to Laifeng County to provide technical guidance. Such a collaborative relationship is a true communist collaborative relationship, a glorious victory of the Party's General Line, and a glorious victory of the Party's mass movement.
    In the old society, the regional boundaries between provinces and counties were extremely strict. This was not only because there were sharp conflicts between the exploiting classes and the exploited classes, but also because there were sharp contradictions within the exploiting classes. In such a society, there was naturally no question of mutual assistance and cooperation. In socialist society, the means of production belong to the collective. Although the natural conditions are different between this region and that region, and the specific requirements for production are not exactly the same, their fundamental interests are the same, which is to jointly develop production and build socialism in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way. Therefore, there is a solid foundation for them to support each other and improve together. The fact of comprehensive collaboration among Longshan, Laifeng, and Xuan'en counties vividly illustrates this truth.
    The experience of Longshan, Laifeng, and Xuan'en counties proves that the key to establishing a good collaborative relationship between neighboring provinces and counties lies in the importance attached to it by the Party committees at all levels. In recent years, leading cadres from Hubei and Hunan provinces have visited cadres and masses in neighboring provinces and counties when inspecting work in this area. The exchanges between the prefectural and county committees of both sides are also extremely close. This communist spirit of collaboration among leading cadres has set a vivid example for the masses, making them feel more deeply: "As close as brothers, hearts linked together," and demanding "advance side by side."

    协作产生力量
    宜勤
    “三人一条心，黄土变成金”，这是中国的一句古话。用现代的术语来说，这就是：“协作产生力量”。读完龙山、来凤、宣恩三县展开全面大协作，促进工农业生产进一步发展的消息，使人更加相信这几句话的正确。现在，已经不是简单地“三人一条心”，而是扩而大之，成了三县一条心了。三县人民的协作精神，给那个地区的社会主义建设事业增加了无限的力量。
    龙山县是湖南省的边境县，来凤、宣恩两县是湖北省的边境县，虽然分属两省，他们却打破了县界与省界之间的界限，建立了彼此支援和互通有无的协作关系。看吧！龙山县要兴建一座水库，来凤、宣恩县认为这是龙山县人民的大喜事，本着小利服从大利的原则，全力支持。对本地区因修水库将要被水淹没的稻田和移民工作，立即做了妥善安排，派出技术人员帮助龙山县拟订施工计划。水库施工以后，来凤、宣恩两县群众又自动支援了大批器材。再看吧！1957年来凤县试种双季稻，由于早稻的品种不好，产量不高；去年龙山县为了帮助来凤县提高双季稻产量，实现共同跃进，虽然自己县里的良种也不够用，但仍抽调了成熟期早、产量高的早稻良种十三万多斤，支援来凤县。龙山许多有经验的干部和农民，还自动到来凤县进行技术指导。这样的协作关系，是真正的共产主义协作关系，是党的总路线的光辉胜利，是党的群众运动的光辉胜利。
    在旧社会，省与省、县与县之间的地区界限极为森严，这不仅因为剥削阶级和被剥削阶级之间存在着尖锐的冲突，而且剥削阶级内部也存在着尖锐的矛盾。在那样的社会里，自然谈不上互助协作的关系了。在社会主义社会里，生产资料属于集体所有，这个地区和那个地区之间，虽然自然条件不一样，对生产的具体要求也不尽相同，但是，它们的根本利益是一致的，这就是共同发展生产、多快好省地建设社会主义。因此，它们之间就有了互相支援，共同提高的坚实基础。龙山、来凤、宣恩三县全面协作的事实，生动地说明了这个道理。
    龙山、来凤、宣恩三县的经验证明：邻省邻县之间，要搞好协作关系，关键在于各级党委的重视。几年来，湖北、湖南两省的领导干部到这一带检查工作时，都深入到邻省邻县的干部和群众中进行访问。双方地、县委之间的往来也极为密切。领导干部的这种共产主义协作精神给群众做出了生动的榜样。使群众更深切地感到：“亲如兄弟心连心”，要求“并肩携手共跃进”。
