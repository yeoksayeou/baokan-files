Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - The Japanese Communist Party's central organ journal, "Avant-Garde," in its December issue, published an article entitled "Revising the Security Treaty and the People's Path," which analyzes the various deceptive words in the draft of the revised Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and reveals the treaty's aggressive nature.

The article states: "The revised Security Treaty is an aggressive military alliance hostile towards China and the Soviet Union. It will make it more difficult for Japan to gain independence and will seriously threaten peace in the Far East."

The article also points out that this treaty will strengthen the rule of reactionary forces, seriously infringe upon the people's lives and rights, and further turn Japan into an aggressive base for U.S. imperialism. Obviously, the aforementioned purpose of the new treaty stems from the ambition of Japanese monopoly capital enterprises, subordinate to the United States, to revive the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" by relying on the United States.

After analyzing the content of the new treaty, the article points out that the core of the new treaty is the preamble, Article 3 concerning the expansion of armaments, and Article 5 concerning joint operations. The provisions in the treaty draft regarding "the principles of the United Nations Charter," "according to the provisions and procedures of the Constitution," and regarding "prior consultation" and the duration of the treaty, are merely tools to conceal the following true intentions: Japan actively participating in the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression against Asia in the name of "contributing to the peace and security of the Far East," legalizing Japan-U.S. joint operations; and stepping up rearmament and promoting the revival of militarism in order to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the treaty. The Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party claim that Japan will not assume new military obligations, which is a complete lie. There is nothing in the new treaty that can guarantee that Japan will not be dragged into wars launched by U.S. imperialism. On the contrary, by adopting the so-called "collective defense" principle, the new treaty includes Japan's obligation to participate in this war.

The article points out that the so-called provision that the actions of U.S. forces stationed in Japan, over which Japan has no veto power, must be "prior consulted" with Japan is merely decorative wording, obviously used to deceive the people.

The article also says, "To what extent can we believe the phrase 'within the provisions and procedures of the Constitution'? The situation is very clear, just by looking at the fact that the government is preparing to maliciously revise the Constitution and is trampling on the Constitution in front of the people."

The article says that limiting the validity of the treaty to ten years is to fix the current Japan-U.S. relationship and, within these ten years, develop the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" into the most reliable aggressive, nuclear-armed forces for the United States.

The article points out that although the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet says it does not pursue a policy of hostility towards China, isn't strengthening the alliance with U.S. imperialism and reviving Japanese militarism through revising the "Security Treaty" the most blatant policy of hostility towards China?

The article condemns the Kishi Nobusuke government's refusal to report the details of the Japan-U.S. negotiations to the Diet. The article says that this is because they fear that after doing so, they will encounter further opposition from the people, deepen the contradictions within the Liberal Democratic Party, and ultimately be unable to sign the new treaty.

The article points out that on such a major issue as revising the "Security Treaty," the people certainly have the right to know the details of this issue. Now is the time when democratic forces and all those who oppose revising the "Security Treaty" must demand that the government publish the full record of the Japan-U.S. negotiations and the draft of the revised "Security Treaty" and the draft of the "Administrative Agreement."

The article calls on the Japanese people to unite to force the government to stop the Japan-U.S. negotiations, prevent Kishi Nobusuke from going to the United States to sign the treaty, and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

    日共“前卫”杂志发表文章
    揭露新日美条约的侵略本质
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央机关刊“前卫”12月号所发表的题为“修改安全条约与人民的道路”的文章，剖析了经过修改的日美“安全条约”草案中种种欺骗性词语，揭示了新条约的侵略本质。
    文章说：“经过修改的安全条约是与中苏为敌的侵略性军事同盟，它将使日本更加难以获得独立，并且将严重威胁远东和平。”
    文章还指出，这个条约将加强反动势力的统治，严重侵犯人民的生活和权利，使日本进一步成为美帝国主义的侵略基地。显然，新条约的上述目的是出于从属于美国的日本垄断资本企业依靠美国复活“大东亚共荣圈”的野心。
    文章分析了新条约的内容后指出，新条约的核心是序言、关于扩充军备的第三条和关于联合作战的第五条。条约草案中关于“根据联合国宪章的原则”、“根据宪法的规定和手续”以及关于“事先协商”和条约有效期限的规定，只不过是掩盖下述真正企图的工具：日本在“对远东的和平和安全作出贡献”的名义下积极参加美帝国主义的侵略亚洲的政策，使日美联合作战合法化；并且为了履行条约规定的义务而加紧重整军备和促进军国主义的复活。岸信介政府和自由民主党宣传说，日本将不承担军事上的新义务，这完全是假话。新条约中没有任何东西可以保障日本不被卷进美帝国主义发动的战争。相反地，由于采用所谓“共同防御”的原则，新条约包含了日本参加这个战争的义务。
    文章指出，日本没有否决权的所谓驻日美军的行动要同日本“事先协商”的规定只不过是装饰的词句，显然是用来欺骗人民的。
    文章又说，我们能够在什么程度上相信“在宪法的规定和手续内”行事这句话呢？只要看一看政府正在准备恶劣地修改宪法，并且正在人民的面前蹂躏宪法的事实，情况就非常清楚了。
    文章说，把条约的有效期限定为十年，就是要使目前的日美关系固定起来，并在这十年内把日本“自卫队”发展成对美国来说最可靠的侵略性的核武装军队。
    文章指出，虽然岸信介内阁说它没有执行敌视中国的政策，但是，通过修改“安全条约”来加强同美帝国主义的同盟和复活日本军国主义，不正是最露骨的敌视中国的政策吗？
    文章谴责岸信介政府拒绝向国会报告日美谈判情况的行为。文章说，这是因为他们害怕这样做了以后，就会遭到人民进一步的反对，加深自由民主党内部的矛盾，最后不能签署新的条约。
    文章指出，关于修改“安全条约”这样重大的问题，人民当然有权利去详细了解这个问题。目前正是民主力量和一切反对修改“安全条约”的人们必须要求政府公布日美谈判的全部记录和修改后的“安全条约”草案和“行政协定”草案的时候。
    文章呼吁日本人民为迫使政府停止日美谈判、阻止岸信介到美国签字和打倒岸信介内阁而团结起来。
