Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 17th. "Democratic Korea" published an editorial today demanding that the United Nations immediately take measures to withdraw the US aggressor troops and other foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the banner of the "United Nations Forces," and to immediately dissolve the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea," which has become an instrument of US aggression.

The editorial stated that due to the conspiratorial activities of US imperialism, the Korean issue has been illegally included in the agenda of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly and will be discussed at the Political Committee meeting of the current UN General Assembly. The editorial pointed out that the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves and should not be discussed in the United Nations. However, under the pressure of US imperialism, the United Nations not only does not listen to the sincere calls of the Korean people, but also, without the participation of representatives of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, has adopted a one-sided position from the beginning, causing the United Nations to lose its moral authority.

The editorial stated that the government of the Republic has consistently maintained that the Korean issue is an internal affair of the Korean people. The Korean issue must be resolved peacefully by the Korean people themselves on a democratic basis, and no external interference is allowed.

The editorial said that if the current session of the United Nations General Assembly wants to make the discussion of the Korean issue have a positive effect, it should respect the will of the Korean people and must have the participation of the true representatives of the Korean people—representatives of the government of the Republic.

The editorial stated that the Korean people firmly maintain that, for the sake of peace in Korea and the Far East and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the United Nations should first take practical measures to immediately withdraw the US aggressor troops and other foreign troops from South Korea.

    “民主朝鲜报”发表社论
    谴责美国操纵联大讨论朝鲜问题
    据新华社平壤17日电　“民主朝鲜报”今天发表社论，要求联合国立即采取措施，把打着“联合国军”旗号的美国侵略军和其他外国军队撤出南朝鲜，并且立即解散成为美国的侵略工具的“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会”。
    社论说，由于美帝国主义的阴谋活动，朝鲜问题又被非法列入本届联合国大会会议的议程，并将在本届联合国大会政治委员会会议上进行讨论。社论指出，朝鲜问题应该由朝鲜人民自己来解决，而不应该在联合国中进行讨论。可是，联合国在美帝国主义的压力下，不仅不倾听朝鲜人民的真诚的呼声，而且在没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表参加的情况下，从一开始就采取了片面的立场，使联合国丧失了道义上的权威。
    社论说，共和国政府一贯主张，朝鲜问题是朝鲜人民的内政。朝鲜问题必须在民主的基础上由朝鲜人民自己和平解决，不容许任何外来的干涉。
    社论说，本届联合国大会会议如果要使关于朝鲜问题的讨论发生积极作用，就应该尊重朝鲜人民的意志，并且必须有朝鲜人民的真正代表——共和国政府的代表参加。
    社论说，朝鲜人民坚决主张，为了朝鲜和远东的和平和朝鲜问题的和平解决，联合国应该首先采取实际措施，立即从南朝鲜撤出美国侵略军和其他外国军队。
