    Old Hero Cleverly Overcomes Difficulties
    Hard work and ingenuity, Zhao Yushan,
    Conquer the difficult Mianzhong transportation;
    Shorten the route and save money,
    Saving the country ninety thousand yuan.

    After reading this poem, the outline of the hero's story is already eighty or ninety percent clear. Zhao Yushan is an old worker in the transmission and distribution work area of the Shanxi Provincial Electric Power Bureau's Construction Bureau, specializing in transportation work. His work has consistently been active and diligent, and he often completes transportation tasks in the most difficult conditions, using the most economical and fastest methods. Here, we only talk about a story about him stringing lines in Mianzhong.
    The Mianzhong line is a power transmission line from Mianchi in Henan across the Yellow River to the Gudui area of Zhongtiao Mountain in Shanxi. The line is seven kilometers long and passes through many mountains and rivers. To complete this task, the first difficulty was how to transport more than 1.4 million ton-kilometers of equipment and materials to the high mountains where there were no roads. The difficulties did not defeat Zhao Yushan. He carried forward the style of daring to think, daring to act, and boldly creating. He erected more than 800 meters of aerial cableways along the way to deliver materials quickly and economically to every mountain.
    While surveying the transportation route, with the help of the local villagers, he also discovered that the design route of the poles from Mianchi to Shangyao could be shortened. So he made a suggestion to the leadership. His suggestion was adopted, and this alone saved the country 90,000 yuan in investment.
    In his ordinary work position, Zhao Yushan always offers ideas for national construction, so he attended this National Congress of Heroes.

    老英雄巧破难关
    苦干巧干赵玉山，
    征服渑中运输关；
    缩短线路又省钱，
    为国节约九万元。
    读了这首诗，英雄故事的梗概已经明白八九分了。赵玉山是山西省电力厅基建局送变电工区专门作运输工作的老工人。他的工作一贯积极努力，经常在最艰难的条件下，以最省最快的办法完成运输任务。这里只说他在渑中架线的一段故事。
    渑中线是由河南渑池跨过黄河到山西中条山古堆地方的一条输电线。线路全长七公里，要通过许多山岭河流。完成这项任务，第一个难关是如何把一百四十多万吨公里的设备和材料运送到从来没有道路的高山上去。困难没有难倒赵玉山，他发扬了敢想敢干大胆创造的风格，在沿途架起了八百多米长的架空索道，把物资又快又省地送到每一座山上。
    在勘察运输线路的同时，在当地老乡的帮助下，他还发现了渑池至上窑的杆位设计路线可以缩短。于是他向领导上提出了建议。他的建议被采用后，仅此一项，就为国家节省了九万元的投资。
    在平凡的工作岗位上，赵玉山处处为国家建设出主意，因此出席了这次全国群英会。
