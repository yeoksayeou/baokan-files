Industrial Common Sense

    Hydraulic Coal Mining

    Hydraulic coal mining is the use of hydraulic power for coal extraction, transportation, and hoisting. In the production process, water is pressurized using a high-pressure water pump, bringing the water pressure to 30 to 60 atmospheres, and in some cases, 100 to 120 atmospheres. During coal extraction, the high-pressure water is ejected through the nozzle of a water gun, forming a powerful stream of water that impacts the coal seam, breaking the coal down. The coal, along with the returning water flow, is sent through a coal chute to a coal-water sump at the bottom of the mine. Then, a coal-water pump discharges the coal-water mixture from the coal-water sump to the surface processing plant for sorting, washing, dewatering, and drying. This technology greatly simplifies the coal mining production process and reduces the heavy manual labor of miners. Compared to general mechanized coal mining, it can increase output by 30%, improve labor efficiency by one to two times, and reduce timber consumption by 60% to 90%.

    水力采煤
    水力采煤是利用水力进行采煤、运煤和提升。在生产过程中，用高压水泵将水加压力，使水压达到三十至六十个大气压，有的达到一百至一百二十个大气压。采煤时，使高压水通过水枪的喷嘴射出，形成一股强有力的水流，冲击煤层，把煤炭冲决下来。煤炭随着反回的水流，经过溜煤槽子被送到井底的煤水仓。然后用煤水泵将煤水混合物从煤水仓排送到地面的选炼厂，进行选洗和脱水、干燥。这种技术大大地简化了煤矿的生产过程，减少了矿工的笨重体力劳动。它与一般机械化采煤比较，产量可提高30％，劳动效率可提高一到二倍，坑木消耗量可降低60％到90％。
