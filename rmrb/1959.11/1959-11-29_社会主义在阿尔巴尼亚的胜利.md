    Socialism's Victory in Albania
    Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party
    Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, Mu Xiehu
    It has been exactly fifteen years since Albania was completely liberated from foreign fascist oppression and the people's regime was established.
    The Albanian people's regime was established through the bloody armed struggle of the Albanian people against the Italian fascist army, the German Nazi army, and the domestic reactionary forces loyal to foreign bandits.
    The Soviet people's Great Patriotic War against the Hitlerite army and the historically significant victory won in this war was a decisive external factor, while the leadership of the working class through the Communist Party (now the Labor Party) over our country's national liberation struggle was the decisive internal factor in the Albanian people's attainment of this historically significant victory fifteen years ago.
    The occupation of Albania by Mussolini's army on April 7, 1939, was the first step in Italian fascism's "eastward advance." Because the Italian army wanted to use Albania as its base for further occupying the Balkans and pushing the front line to the Soviet border.
    After the country was occupied by fascist Italy, the most urgent and basic strategic task facing our people was to fight fascism for the liberation of the country. Without solving this anti-imperialist task, it would be impossible to solve any of the anti-feudal tasks facing the Albanian revolutionary movement.
    From the day the Italian fascist army invaded Albania, the Albanian people began their armed struggle for national liberation. This struggle continued until the complete liberation of the country. After the establishment of the Albanian Communist Party on November 8, 1941, this struggle took the form of an organized struggle.
    The Communist Party mobilized the people to fight against foreign bandits and traitors to the motherland. The Communist Party was the only party leading the national liberation struggle. Because the party's program embodied the highest interests of our country's working people: to wage an irreconcilable struggle against foreign bandits, to liberate the motherland from foreign oppression, to overthrow the reactionary rule of the bourgeois landlord clique loyal to foreign aggressors, and to seize power by the working people led by the working class.
    The main method of achieving these historical tasks was to establish the National Liberation Front. Various strata of working people (the working class, poor peasants, middle peasants, and the urban petty and middle bourgeoisie) united around it. The National Liberation Front was the embodiment of the fighting alliance of workers and peasants. The working class ensured its leading role in this alliance through the Communist Party. Landlords, big bourgeoisie, and rich peasants colluded with foreign aggressors against the National Liberation Front.
    The struggle against the fascist occupiers was a severe and bloody struggle. It led to sharp class divisions, intertwined with class struggle, and evolved into a veritable civil war under conditions of foreign occupation. Therefore, our national liberation struggle was not simply a struggle against foreign fascist bandits. It was not only anti-fascist and anti-imperialist in nature but also a thorough people's democratic revolution. This revolution opened the way to embark on the socialist revolution after liberation.
    Therefore, our Party never separated the question of the working people led by the working class seizing power from the question of striving for the liberation of the motherland from foreign fascist occupiers. The working class led this revolution. Although it was a small and young class without special experience, it was the most revolutionary class. It exercised its leadership through the Communist Party that represented it. Ensuring the leadership of the working class through the Communist Party over this revolution, the organic link between this revolution and the Soviet Great Patriotic War, and its development in the most acute era of the general crisis of world capitalism - all this prompted our revolution to not only remain within the scope of the people's democratic, anti-imperialist, and anti-feudal revolution but also to carry certain socialist factors.
    The Communist Party knew that the question of seizing power was the basic question of any revolution. Therefore, in addition to mobilizing the people to engage in armed struggle and leading this struggle, it also organized national liberation committees, which were the core of the people's regime. Its leading role belonged to the working class represented by the Communist Party. Therefore, with the national liberation on November 29, 1944, the work of forcefully overthrowing the bourgeois landlord system was completed, the question of power was thoroughly resolved in favor of the working people under the leadership of the working-class party, and the people's regime was established. This made it possible to smoothly and rapidly transition from the people's democratic revolution to the socialist revolution.
    After liberation, while completing the basic tasks of a general democratic nature, the Party put forward the task of broadly transitioning to the realization of the tasks of the socialist revolution. In this way, the final stage of completing the tasks of the democratic revolution in our country was closely intertwined with the stage of beginning to realize the tasks of the socialist revolution.
    The war brought great damage to our country. The entire economy was completely destroyed. After liberation, in addition to adopting democratic and socialist reforms, we also faced the urgent task of restoring the economy destroyed by the war.
    In the two or three years after liberation, we restored the economy by relying on the general mobilization of the entire nation. At the end of the restoration work, the Party put forward to the people the historical task of socialist construction. The Party knew that to build socialism, it was necessary to implement national industrialization, transform agriculture according to socialist principles, develop public ownership of industrial and agricultural production, and on this basis, ensure the continuous growth of the material and cultural living standards of the working people.
    1947 was the first year of implementing the national planned economy. After successfully completing the annual plan for 1947 and the two-year plan for 1948-1949, we began to implement the first five-year plan (1951-1955), and now we are in the fourth year of the second five-year plan.
    Under the comprehensive and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, People's China, and other people's democratic countries, and under the correct Marxist-Leninist leadership of the Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the founder and organizer of the Party, the Albanian people are building socialism with selfless labor and great success. Albania has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an agricultural-industrial country with modern socialist industry and increasingly developing collectivized socialist agriculture.
    This year's total industrial output value has increased approximately twenty-one times compared to 1938. Compared with 1938, our achievements this year are: oil increased by 3.6 times; coal increased by 76 times; chromium ore increased by 35 times; electricity increased by 17 times; cement increased by 7 times; cotton cloth increased by 65 times; boots and shoes increased by 2.7 times, and so on.
    Investment during the second five-year plan (1956-1960) increased by more than 95% compared to the first five-year plan (1951-1955).
    The Party and the people's regime pay special attention to the development of agriculture. We have always been very clear that the only correct path to develop agriculture is the socialist path, the path of agricultural collectivization based on the experience of Soviet collective farms. Now, cooperative economies in agriculture account for 81.5% of the total cultivated land area of farmers and about 70% of the total number of farm households. Including state-owned farms, the entire socialist economic component accounts for approximately 84% of the republic's cultivated land area.
    Compared with 1938, the cultivated land area has increased by 81%, grain production has more than doubled, cotton production has increased by 123 times, tobacco production has increased by 5 times, and so on.
    While rapidly realizing the mechanization of agriculture, the state has invested a large amount of funds in carrying out huge soil improvement projects, draining land, and irrigating land.
    Improving the material and cultural living standards of the working people has always been the focus of attention of the Party and the people's regime.
    Now, the total volume of commodity circulation exceeds approximately five times that of 1938.
    The national income in 1958 increased by 2.5 times compared to 1938, and the per capita income increased by 1.4 times. In 1959, the actual wages of the working people increased by more than 29% compared to 1955, the per capita actual income of farmers increased by more than 30%, the total revenue of the state budget increased by 116%, the state expenditure increased by 147%, and the expenditure for cultural life increased by 174%.
    In 1959, the number of workers increased eightfold compared to 1938, and the number of experts with higher education increased sevenfold. Now, compared with 1938, our primary schools have increased by 3.4 times, primary school students have increased by 3.6 times, middle schools have increased by 5.4 times, middle school students have increased by 8.4 times, and the national universities established in recent years have about 4,000 university students.
    If illiteracy accounted for 80% of the population before the war, then in recent years illiteracy has been eliminated among residents under the age of forty. Now, on average, one in every six citizens of the republic is studying.
    Now our cinemas are about 3.4 times more than in 1938, and medical institutions are 12.4 times more. If there were no theaters before the war, now we have sixteen professional theaters, including the National Opera and Ballet Theatre.
    In addition to achievements in the economic and cultural aspects, significant qualitative changes have also taken place in the social class structure. For example, in 1958, socialist components accounted for more than 98% in industry, 78.4% in agriculture, and 87.5% in retail commerce. Socialist components accounted for more than 82% of the total value of national income in 1958. With the establishment of socialist relations of production, the system of man exploiting man has been eliminated in our country as a whole.
    The above are the major achievements made by our people. These achievements are the result of the selfless labor of our country's working people, the result of the correct line of our Labor Party, and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. The People's Republic of Albania is a clear example that even a small country like Albania can make such great achievements in the era of the existence of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the vigorous development of socialism, and the general decline of world imperialism, as long as the working-class party correctly leads it to advance along the road of revolution and socialist construction.
    The achievements made by the Albanian people in the heroic national liberation struggle and socialist construction after liberation prove that the general line of the Albanian Labor Party has always been correct. Our Party has not committed any serious or principled errors since its founding eighteen years ago. What is the reason? The reason is that our Party has relied on the universal experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union throughout its existence and in all its activities. Our Party believes that this experience is the best experience and applies it to the reality and specific conditions of our country.
    The road our Party has traveled has not been smooth sailing. This is a road of armed struggle against foreign bandits and the ruling class, a road of irreconcilable ideological struggle against enemies inside and outside the Party, and a road of arduous struggle to restore the national economy and build socialism.
    Opportunists of all stripes in the Party have always attempted to make our Party abandon its Marxist-Leninist general line and force it to surrender to the enemy. However, our Party and its Central Committee have resolutely and decisively dealt with all the conspiracies of these enemies, and have unswervingly advanced along the correct Marxist-Leninist path.
    The People's Republic of Albania is building socialism under geographically capitalist encirclement, its territory is not connected with other countries of the socialist camp, and it is often under the ferocious pressure of Western imperialism and revisionist and Trotskyist Yugoslavia.
    Foreign enemies, especially Yugoslav revisionists, have instigated many major conspiracies against our country. The Yugoslav revisionist and Trotskyist leaders have never been as vicious, rampant, and despicable towards any country as they have been towards our Party and our people. They have been constantly attacking us since the beginning of the national liberation struggle until now.
    Based on years of experience, our Party and our people firmly believe that the Yugoslav revisionist leadership group is the deadly enemy of the Albanian people, the socialist camp, and the international communist and workers' movement. It is not only incurable but also the most dangerous agent of international imperialism in the international communist movement. Our people and our Party will always be vigilant in carrying out a principled ideological struggle, without the slightest compromise with the Yugoslav revisionists and Trotskyists, and will carry out the struggle until they are completely defeated ideologically. Our Party and our people never separate the ideological struggle against world imperialism from the ideological struggle against modern revisionism represented by the Yugoslav leadership group.
    The government of the People's Republic of Albania has always pursued a thorough peaceful foreign policy in accordance with the principles of peaceful coexistence. The foundation of our country's foreign policy is the unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union, People's China, and other countries of the socialist camp. Because without this friendship, the People's Republic of Albania would not be able to exist as a free and sovereign state.
    The Albanian people are celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of their motherland in a situation of easing international tension. The easing of international tension is the result of the peaceful policies of the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist camp. Our government is making every effort to promote the easing of international tension and ensure peace in the Balkans, Europe, and the world. The Albanian people are united as one around their Party and government. They are looking to their future with optimism, and they are exerting greater strength than ever before to complete the tasks given to them by the Party - the tasks of the second five-year plan.
    On this great festival of our country, our people, Party, and government extend our most sincere respect to the great Chinese people, to the glorious Communist Party of China, the formulator of the wise and correct Marxist-Leninist general line, headed by the great Comrade Mao Zedong, and to the government of the People's Republic of China, and are grateful to China for everything it has done to assist our socialist construction and defend our independence. We wish the Party, government, and people of China greater and greater achievements on the glorious road of building socialism.

    社会主义在阿尔巴尼亚的胜利
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员
     阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席  穆·谢胡
    自从阿尔巴尼亚从外国法西斯压迫下彻底解放和建立人民政权以来，已经整整过了十五年。
    阿尔巴尼亚的人民政权，是阿尔巴尼亚人民经过同意大利法西斯军队、德国纳粹军队以及效忠外国强盗的本国反动势力的流血武装斗争而建立起来的。
    苏联人民反对希特勒军队的伟大卫国战争和在这一战争中赢得的具有历史意义的胜利，是具有决定意义的外部因素，而工人阶级通过共产党（现在的劳动党）对我国民族解放斗争的领导，则是决定十五年前阿尔巴尼亚人民取得具有历史意义胜利的决定性的内部因素。
    1939年4月7日，墨索里尼的军队侵占阿尔巴尼亚，是意大利法西斯“东进”的第一步。因为意大利军队想要利用阿尔巴尼亚作为它进一步侵占巴尔干的基地，并且把战线推向苏联国境。
    在国家遭到法西斯意大利占领后，为争取解放国家而同法西斯进行斗争，是摆在我国人民面前最迫切的基本战略任务。不解决这个反帝的任务，也就不可能解决阿尔巴尼亚革命运动所面临的任何一个反封建的任务。
    从意大利法西斯军队侵入阿尔巴尼亚的那一天起，阿尔巴尼亚人民就开始了民族解放的武装斗争。这一斗争一直继续到全国彻底解放为止。在1941年11月8日阿尔巴尼亚共产党成立后，这一斗争形成了有组织的斗争。
    共产党发动人民同外国强盗和祖国叛徒们进行斗争，共产党是领导民族解放斗争的唯一政党。因为党的纲领体现了我国劳动人民的最高利益：同外国强盗进行不调和的斗争、从外国压迫下解放祖国、推翻效忠外国侵略者的资产阶级地主集团的反动政权、以工人阶级为首的劳动人民夺取政权。
    实现这些历史任务的主要方法是建立民族解放阵线。各劳动人民阶层（工人阶级、贫农、中农、城市的中小资产阶级）都团结在它的周围。民族解放阵线是工农战斗联盟的具体化。工人阶级通过共产党确保了自己在这一联盟中的领导作用。地主、大资产阶级和富农同外国侵略者勾结起来反对民族解放阵线。
    同法西斯占领者的斗争是严重的流血斗争。它导致了尖锐的阶级分化，它同阶级斗争交织在一起，并且演成了在外国占领条件下的名副其实的国内战争。因此，我们的民族解放斗争，不单纯是反对外国法西斯强盗的斗争。它不仅具有反法西斯和反帝的性质，同时又完全是一次人民民主革命。这一革命开辟了在解放后走上社会主义革命的道路。
    因此，我党从来不把以工人阶级为首的劳动人民夺取政权问题同为争取祖国从外国法西斯占领者手中取得解放的问题分开来。工人阶级领导了这次革命。虽然它是人数不多的年青的阶级，又没有特别的经验，但它是最革命的阶级。它通过代表它的共产党实现自己的领导权。确保工人阶级通过共产党对这一革命的领导、这一革命同苏联伟大卫国战争的有机联系及其在世界资本主义总危机最尖锐时代的发展，——这一切促使我国革命既没有超出人民民主、反帝反封建革命的范畴，又带有若干的社会主义因素。
    共产党知道，夺取政权问题是任何革命的基本问题。因此，它除了动员人民从事武装斗争和领导这一斗争外，还组织了民族解放委员会，这是人民政权的核心。其领导作用属于以共产党为代表的工人阶级。因此，随着1944年11月29日全国解放，完成了强力推翻资产阶级地主制度的工作，政权问题得到了彻底地、有利于工人阶级政党领导下的劳动人民的解决，建立起人民政权。这就有可能顺利而迅速地从人民民主革命过渡到社会主义革命。
    解放后，党在完成一般民主性质的基本任务的同时，提出了广泛地向实现社会主义革命任务过渡的任务。就这样，在我国完成民主革命任务的最后阶段同开始实现社会主义革命任务的阶段密切地交织在一起。
    战争给我国带来了巨大的损害。整个经济彻底毁坏了。解放后，除了采取民主和社会主义性质的改革措施外，我们还面临着恢复被战争破坏了的经济的迫切任务。
    在解放后的两三年内，我们依靠全国人民的普遍动员，恢复了经济。在恢复工作结束时，党向人民提出了社会主义建设的历史任务。党知道，要建设社会主义就必须实行国家工业化、根据社会主义原则改造农业、发展公有的工农业生产，并且在这个基础上保证劳动人民物质与文化生活水平的不断增长。
    1947年是实行国家计划经济的第一年。在胜利地完成1947年的年度计划和1948—1949年二年计划以后，我们便着手执行第一个五年计划（1951—1955年），而现在我们正处于第二个五年计划的第四年。
    在苏联、人民中国和其他人民民主国家全面无私的援助下，在以党的创始人和组织者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党的马克思列宁主义的正确领导下，阿尔巴尼亚人民正以忘我的劳动十分成功地建设着社会主义。阿尔巴尼亚已经从落后的农业国变成了拥有现代社会主义工业和日益发展的集体化社会主义农业的农业—工业国家。
    今年的工业总产值比1938年增长大约二十一倍。同1938年相比，我们在今年取得的成就是：石油增长三点六倍；煤炭增长七十六倍；铬矿增长三十五倍；电力增长十七倍；水泥增长七倍；棉布增长六十五倍；靴鞋增长二点七倍，等等。
    第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）期间的投资比第一个五年计划（1951—1955年）增加95％以上。
    党和人民政权特别重视发展农业。我们一向很清楚，发展农业的唯一正确道路是社会主义道路，是以苏联集体农庄经验为基础的农业集体化道路。现在，农业中的合作经济占农民全部耕地面积的81.5％，占总农户的70％左右。连国营农场计算在一起，整个社会主义经济成分约占共和国耕地面积的84％。
    同1938年相比，耕地面积增加了81％，粮食增产一倍以上，棉花增产一百二十三倍，烟草增产五倍，等等。
    在迅速实现农业机械化的同时，国家投入了大量资金来进行巨大的土壤改良工程、疏干土地和灌溉土地。
    提高劳动人民的物质与文化生活水平，一向是党和人民政权注意的中心。
    现在，商品流转总额超过了1938年的五倍左右。
    1958年的国民收入比1938年增加二点五倍，按人口平均的收入增长一点四倍。1959年劳动人民的实际工资比1955年增加29％以上，农民按人口平均的实际收入增加30％以上，国家预算总收入增加116％，国家支出增加147％，而用于文化生活的支出则增加174％。
    1959年同1938年相比，工人人数增加八倍，受过高等教育的专家增加七倍。现在同1938年相比，我们的小学增加三点四倍，小学生增加三点六倍，中学增加五点四倍，中学生增加八点四倍，近年来创办的国立大学约有四千名大学生。
    如果说战前文盲占人口的80％，那末近年来在四十岁以下的居民当中已经扫除了文盲。现在，共和国的公民平均每六人当中有一个人在学习。
    现在我们的电影院比1938年多三点四倍左右，医疗机关则多十二点四倍。如果说战前一个戏院也没有，那末现在我们已经有十六家专业剧院，其中包括国家歌剧和芭蕾舞剧院。
    除了经济和文化方面的成就外，社会阶级结构也起了重大的质的变化。比如，1958年社会主义成分在工业中占98％以上，在农业中占78.4％，在零售商业中占87.5％。社会主义成分在1958年国民收入总值中占82％以上。随着社会主义生产关系的确立，我国整个说来已消灭了人剥削人的制度。
    以上是我国人民所取得的重大成就。这些成就是我国劳动人民忘我劳动的成果，是我们劳动党正确路线和苏联及其他人民民主国家无私援助的结果。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国是一个鲜明的榜样，它说明即使像阿尔巴尼亚这样一个小国，在存在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营时代、社会主义蓬勃发展和世界帝国主义普遍衰朽的时代，只要有工人阶级政党正确地领导它沿着革命和社会主义建设道路前进，就可以做出这样大的成就。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民在英勇的民族解放斗争和解放后的社会主义建设中所取得的成就证明，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的总路线一向是正确的。从创立十八年以来我党没有犯过任何严重的和原则性的错误。原因何在呢？原因在于我党在存在的整个时期，在它的整个活动中是以苏联共产党的普遍经验为依据的。我党认为这个经验是最好的经验，并且使之适用于我国的现实和具体条件下。
    我党所走过的道路并不是一帆风顺的。这是同外国强盗和统治阶级进行武装斗争、同党内外敌人进行不调和的思想斗争，以及为恢复国家经济和建设社会主义而进行艰巨斗争的道路。
    党的队伍中的各色各样机会主义分子，始终企图使我党放弃它的马克思列宁主义总路线，迫使它向敌人投降。但是，我党及其中央委员会坚毅果敢地对付这些敌人的一切阴谋，始终不渝地沿着正确的马克思列宁主义道路前进。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国是在地理上处于资本主义包围的条件下建设社会主义的，它的领土同社会主义阵营其他各国无联系，而且经常处在西方帝国主义及修正主义和托洛茨基主义的南斯拉夫的凶恶压力之下。
    国外敌人特别是南斯拉夫修正主义者，对我国策动了许多重大的阴谋。南斯拉夫的修正主义和托洛茨基主义领导人对于任何国家都没有像对待我们党和我国人民这样地穷凶极恶，这样地猖狂和卑鄙。从民族解放斗争开始直到现在，他们一直不断地攻击我们。
    我党和我国人民基于多年的经验绝对相信，南斯拉夫修正主义领导集团，是阿尔巴尼亚人民、社会主义阵营和国际共产主义与工人运动的死敌。它不仅是不可救药的，而且是国际帝国主义在国际共产主义运动中最危险的代理人。我国人民和我党将时刻警觉地进行原则性的思想斗争，丝毫也不同南斯拉夫的修正主义者和托洛茨基分子妥协，把斗争进行到在思想上彻底打垮他们为止。我党和我国人民从来不把同世界帝国主义的思想斗争和同以南斯拉夫领导集团为代表的现代修正主义的思想斗争分开来。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府无论过去和将来都是按照和平共处原则执行彻底的和平外交政策。我国对外政策的基础，是同苏联、人民中国及社会主义阵营其他国家的牢不可破的友谊。因为没有这种友谊，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国就不可能作为自由的主权国家存在下去。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民是在国际紧张局势和缓的情况下，庆祝祖国解放十五周年的。国际紧张局势的缓和，是苏联及社会主义阵营各国和平政策的成果。我国政府尽一切努力来促进国际紧张局势的缓和，确保巴尔干、欧洲及全世界的和平。阿尔巴尼亚人民像一个人似地紧紧团结在自己的党和政府的周围。他们以乐观主义的目光注视着自己的将来，他们发挥了比任何时候更大的力量来完成党给他们提出的任务——第二个五年计划的任务。
    值此我国伟大的节日，我国人民、党和政府向伟大的中国人民，向英明的、正确的马克思列宁主义总路线的制定者、以伟大的毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党，向中华人民共和国政府致以最热诚的敬意，并且感激中国为援助我国社会主义建设和保卫独立所做的一切。祝中国的党、政府和人民在建设社会主义的光荣道路上取得越来越大的成就。
