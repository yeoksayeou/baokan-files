Grasp Problems On the Spot, Take Measures On the Spot, Organize Coordination On the Spot
    On-Site Promotion Meetings Skillfully Break Through Key Production Issues
    Taiyuan's Experience Proves: On-Site Promotion Meetings are a Good Way to Mobilize the Masses to Break Through Weak Links in a Timely Manner, and are a Major Reform in Leadership Methods.

    (Our newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch, November 15th) The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee have recently widely convened on-site promotion meetings in industrial and mining enterprises and basic construction sites, enabling the city's industrial production to leap forward again and again, and many basic construction projects to be put into production ahead of schedule.

    On-site promotion meetings are a major reform in the leadership's working methods in Taiyuan City this year. Up to now, the city has held more than ten such promotion meetings, and the results have been very good. Such meetings are generally presided over by leading comrades such as the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, the Mayor, and the Minister of Industry of the Municipal Party Committee. These on-site promotion meetings have solved many problems: First, they have promptly discovered the constantly emerging imbalances in production and basic construction, and through on-site organization of large-scale collaboration, problems have been solved in a timely manner, promoting overall leap forward; Second, because the on-site promotion meetings have adopted the practice of organizing, leading, and purposefully concentrating forces to break through weak links, they have ensured the focus and also driven the overall leap forward; Third, the leading comrades of many departments have inspected and discussed problems on-site, which is closer to reality than discussing problems in the office in the past, and has greatly encouraged the workers and promoted the work. Because the on-site promotion meeting adopts the method of going deep into the site, watching and listening to reports at the same time, and then solving problems, the problems in the work are grasped more accurately and the measures to solve the problems are more practical. The basic construction task of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company this year is very large. In addition to several renovation and expansion projects, there are three major new construction projects: a large 1,053-cubic-meter blast furnace, a thermal power plant, and a coke oven. They are all key points of the city's basic construction. However, in the beginning, due to the failure to solve the problems of construction forces and equipment, the progress of the project was slow. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held several on-site promotion meetings here, solving the problems in construction and equipment manufacturing on the spot, greatly boosting the morale of the workers and accelerating the progress of construction. After the last on-site promotion meeting, twenty-eight units organized more than two thousand construction "volunteer soldiers" to support the three major projects: In addition to undertaking the production of more than ten thousand pieces of non-standard equipment, some machine factories also organized more than three hundred technicians to go to the construction site. Many factories and mines have also transferred a large number of installation workers to support. In this way, one promotes everyone, and everyone promotes one, and the three major projects are expected to be put into production three months ahead of the original plan. In early September, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered that the key to not increasing the output of the Xishan Coal Mine was poor equipment maintenance, with many broken and missing parts and accessories. Li Wenjie, Deputy Mayor of Taiyuan City, led the leading cadres of eight machine factories, including Shanxi Machine Factory and Mining Machine Factory, to the Xishan Coal Mine to hold an on-site promotion meeting. The machine factories participating in the on-site promotion meeting, through on-site visits and listening to reports, not only realized that supporting the increase of raw coal production in the Xishan Coal Mine was their bounden duty, but also specifically learned about the projects that needed support. On the basis of unified understanding, the slogan of "squeeze time, get accessories, and support the great harvest of coal" was put forward. Immediately, a batch of "volunteer soldiers" collaboration teams of machinists, fitters, and riveters were organized to go to the Xishan Coal Mine to repair machinery and equipment. In just one month, 1,872 pieces of various accessories were produced, enabling a large number of machines to be put back into operation. In September, the output of raw coal increased by 14% compared with August.

    The on-site promotion meeting played a role in promoting and promoting large-scale collaboration. In late September, the city's steel, coal, and iron production all exceeded the planned daily production level. Only steel production was still some distance away. Steel production has become a weak link in the overall leap forward. The main reason is that some basic construction projects with rolling mills cannot be put into production quickly. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately shifted its leadership energy to steel. Chi Biqing, Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhang Qixiang, Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, led the responsible comrades of relevant provincial and municipal units to the Taiyuan Wire Factory, which has rolling mill infrastructure projects, to hold a promotion meeting. In terms of civil engineering, equipment, and construction, the city organized a large-scale collaboration. More than one hundred units rushed to make parts and accessories for this rolling mill, and Taiyuan Municipal Engineering Company and Shanxi Provincial Third Construction Engineering Company both drew construction forces to engage in civil engineering. As a result, the construction period was shortened by one month compared with the original plan. Now, the steel produced by this factory has begun to support the urgent needs of many factories and mines in Taiyuan City.

    Now, the on-site promotion meeting has become a good way to mobilize the masses to solve problems in a timely manner. For example, several on-site promotion meetings for basic construction materials have been held this year. The meeting was led by the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and cadres from the material management department participated, adopting the method of holding meetings by touring and adjusting on-site. They successively visited more than two hundred and thirty warehouses in nineteen units, and mutually adjusted and supported more than thirty thousand tons of ferrous metals, more than one hundred and twenty tons of non-ferrous metals, and a large number of cement, wood, wires, cables and other materials needed for key projects. The new rolling mill workshop of Taiyuan Locomotive Factory urgently needed two hundred and four hundred water supply valves, which had not been found for a long time, but were solved through the on-site promotion meeting. This method of adjusting materials on the spot is faster and better than sitting in the office to allocate. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to this leadership form of on-site promotion meetings and has recently promoted it throughout the province.

    现场促进会巧破生产关键
    太原的经验证明：现场促进会是发动群众及时突破薄弱环节的好形式，是领导方法一大改革
    本报太原15日电　中共太原市委和市人民委员会最近在工矿企业和基本建设工地广泛召开了现场促进会，使全市工业生产一跃再跃，许多基本建设工程提前投入了生产。
    现场促进会，是今年太原市领导方面工作方法上的一大改革。到现在为止，全市已开过十多次这样的促进会，效果都很好。这样的会议，一般都由市委书记、市长、市委工业部长等领导同志亲自主持。这些现场促进会都解决了不少问题：一、及时发现了生产和基本建设中不断出现的不平衡现象，并通过现场组织大协作，及时解决问题，促进了全面跃进；二、由于现场促进会采取了有组织有领导有目的集中力量突破薄弱环节的做法，因此保证了重点，也带动了全面跃进；三、许多部门的领导同志到现场视察讨论问题，比过去坐在办公室讨论问题更接近实际，而且对工人的鼓舞和对工作的促进起了很大作用。由于现场促进会是采取深入现场，一边看，一边听汇报，然后解决问题的，因此对工作中的问题就摸得比较准而且解决问题的措施也切合实际。太原钢铁公司今年的基本建设任务很大，除了几项改造和扩建工程外，还有一千零五十三立方米的大型高炉、热电站和焦炉三大新建工程。它们都是全市基本建设的重点。但是，开始时由于施工力量和设备等问题没有很好解决，工程进度缓慢。中共太原市委就在这里召开了几次现场促进会，就地解决了施工和设备制造方面的问题，大大鼓舞了工人的干劲，加快了施工进度。最近一次现场促进会开过以后，有二十八个单位组织了两千多人的施工“志愿军”支援三大工程：一些机器厂除担负了一万多台件非标准设备的生产外，还组织了三百多名技术工人开赴施工现场。也有不少厂矿抽调大批安装工人来支援。这样，一家促大家，大家又促一家，三大工程预计可比原计划提前三个月全部投入生产。9月初，中共太原市委发现西山煤矿产量提不高的关键是设备维修不好，坏的和缺少的零件、配件很多。太原市副市长李文杰就带领山西机器厂、矿山机器厂等八个机器厂的领导干部，到西山煤矿去开了一次现场促进会。参加现场促进会的各机器厂，通过现场参观和听汇报，不仅了解到支援西山煤矿增产原煤是自己义不容辞的责任，而且具体摸清了需要支援的项目。在认识统一的基础上，提出了“挤时间、搞配件、支援煤炭大丰收”的口号。立即组织了一批有机工、钳工、铆工的“志愿军”协作队，到西山煤矿检修机器设备。仅一个月时间，生产的各种配件达一千八百七十二件，使大批机械重新上阵，9月份原煤产量比8月份提高了14％。
    现场促进会对组织大协作起了推动和促进作用。9月下旬，全市钢、煤、铁的生产都超过了预定的日产水平。只是钢材生产还有距离。钢材生产成了全面跃进中的薄弱环节。主要原因是一些有轧钢机的基本建设工程不能迅速投入生产。中共太原市委即把领导精力转到钢材上来。中共山西省委书记池必卿、太原市委书记张其祥就带上省市有关单位的负责同志，到有轧钢机基建工程的太原线材厂去开促进会。在土建、设备、施工等方面，组织了全市大协作。有一百多个单位为这台轧钢机赶制零件和配件，太原市政工程公司和山西省第三建筑工程公司都抽出施工力量来搞土建工程。结果，工期比原计划缩短了一个月。现在，这个厂轧出的钢材已开始支援太原市不少厂矿急用。
    现在，现场促进会已成了发动群众及时解决问题的好形式。如今年以来曾召开过几次基本建设物资现场促进会。会议由市委书记挂帅，吸收物资管理部门的干部参加，采取巡回参观、现场调剂的办法开会。他们先后参观了十九个单位的二百三十多个仓库，相互调剂和支援了重点工程所需的黑色金属三万多吨，有色金属一百二十多吨，并有大批水泥、木材、电线、电缆等材料。太原机车厂新建轧钢车间，急需二百和四百的供水阀门，长期没有找到，通过现场促进会得到了解决。这种到现场调剂物资的办法，比坐在办公室分配既快又好。中共山西省委十分重视这种现场促进会的领导形式，最近已在全省推广。
