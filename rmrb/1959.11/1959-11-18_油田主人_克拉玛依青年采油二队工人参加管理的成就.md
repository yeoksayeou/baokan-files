Oilfield Masters
—— Achievements of the Youth Oil Extraction Team Two Workers of Karamay in Participating in Management

The Youth Oil Extraction Team Two of the Oilfield Division of the Karamay Mining Bureau is composed of sixty-five young men and women of Han, Mongolian, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Daur nationalities. This team is responsible for the management of fifty-eight oil wells and seventy metering stations. Since the Great Leap Forward, they have overfulfilled their oil extraction tasks every month and have been awarded the honorary title of advanced production unit. This year, they continued to advance on the basis of last year's victory. From January to September, the team produced more than 100,000 tons of crude oil, exceeding the planned output by 4,831 tons, an increase of three times over the same period last year. Crude oil costs have been decreasing month by month, with the lowest monthly cost dropping by 19.5% compared to the national planned target, and the total cost decreasing by half compared to the same period last year.

Everyone Manages Oil Wells

The main experience of the Youth Oil Extraction Team Two in continuously leaping forward and overproducing every month is that they have adhered to putting politics in command in production, with the Party branch as the core, uniting the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League of the entire team, fully mobilizing the masses, and giving full play to the enthusiasm of the workers.

The management of the oilfield depends on systematically mastering the oil well data and scientifically analyzing and judging the oil layer conditions of each oil well. In the past, the oil well data was controlled by a few engineers and technicians. In addition, the oil wells developed rapidly, and it was impossible for a small number of engineers and technicians to understand the situation of each well in a timely and clear manner and to solve the problems in production correctly and promptly. However, the workers dealt with the oil wells all day long and knew exactly which well was "naughty" and which well was not. After studying this situation, the Party branch proposed to the entire team to decentralize the oil well data to the workers for management, so that "everyone cares about the oil wells, everyone analyzes the oil wells, and everyone becomes a good master of the oilfield." At the same time, it organized the entire team to conduct airing of views and debates, so that every worker understood the significance of mastering the oil well data. At the same time, it criticized the conservative idea that "workers cannot manage oil wells." In this way, the young workers of the entire team began to manage the oil well data.

After the workers managed the oil well data, a lively situation of "everyone caring about the oil wells and everyone analyzing the oil wells" quickly emerged. Many workers, when they discovered any changes in the oil wells, did not even take off their work clothes or eat their meals after work, and rushed to report to the small team to study solutions. In order to calculate the oil and gas volume in a timely manner, many workers automatically bought slide rules and quickly learned how to use them. The workers at each metering station often automatically held "three-way combination" meetings to analyze the oil wells.

In order to better manage the oil wells, the small team technicians and workers together summarized all the original data from the drilling to the oil extraction process and all the data obtained in production and wrote the oil well history, establishing oil well files. The workers found that some wells lacked original data, so they took the initiative to find people everywhere to collect and understand the situation when the oil wells were completed in the past, and took samples from the well for analysis, quickly enabling the entire team to have files for every well and data for every station.

Launch Competitions and Vigorously Promote Innovation

Launching mass labor competitions and vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution is an important method for the Oil Extraction Team Two to increase crude oil production. Under the slogan of high production, high quality, and safe production, the entire team organized labor competitions between stations and individuals, which powerfully promoted the improvement of oil well management level. For example, the twenty-second station, which first won the red flag, due to its full energy, proactive work, and strict system, the oil well management work was carried out in an orderly manner, and truly achieved high production, high quality, and safe production. In order to catch up with the twenty-second station, the eighteenth station held several production meetings for the entire station to conduct research. Through five days of efforts, it vigorously promoted the management archives and data of oil wells, and finally made all its work catch up with the twenty-second station and win the red flag.

With the development of labor competitions, the activities of technical innovation and technical revolution have also become active. From January to September this year, the entire team put forward a total of ninety-eight rationalization proposals, which solved major problems in increasing crude oil production and saving steel. For example, using the natural gas spewing from the oil wells to insulate the oil outlet pipeline with a flue pit solved the problem of ice, wax, and glue blocking the oil outlet pipeline in winter, saving boilers and pipelines. Simplifying the wellhead device greatly saved high-pressure gate valves. This item alone can save the country 4,000 yuan in investment per well. Making oil nozzle submersible, it solves the problem of oil nozzle icing and ensures normal oil production in winter. The creation of a waste crude oil recovery device eliminates the waste of waste crude oil when checking the oil nozzle. These innovations have powerfully ensured overproduction every month.

Strengthening enterprise management is an important reason for the continuous cost reduction of Oil Extraction Team Two. In order to give full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of all the workers in the team to participate in enterprise management, in March this year, under the leadership of the Party branch, the entire team expanded the management organization, established the system of four major personnel (wage officer, material officer, cost officer, asset officer), and established an enterprise management team. The team's political instructor personally took charge, serving as the leader of the enterprise management team, and held regular meetings to study and solve specific problems in the work. The workers' participation in enterprise management has a particularly strong sense of responsibility. In the work, they showed the spirit of being the masters of their own affairs everywhere, cared about costs everywhere, and paid attention to saving everything, even if they used a pipe, they had to carefully calculate, completely reversing the previous chaotic phenomena such as unplanned and uncontrolled material requisition, eliminating waste, and greatly reducing crude oil costs. This year, the cost per ton of crude oil has decreased by 40% compared with last year.

At present, all the staff and workers of Oil Extraction Team Two are continuing to oppose right-leaning thoughts, with greater energy, creating new achievements, and striving to enter 1960 ahead of schedule.

    油田主人
    ——克拉玛依青年采油二队工人参加管理的成就
    克拉玛依矿务局油田处采油一大队青年采油二队，是由六十五名汉族、蒙古族、维吾尔族、哈萨克族和达呼尔族的男女青年组成的。这个队一共看管五十八口油井和七十个计量站。大跃进以来，他们月月超额完成采油任务，得到了先进生产单位的光荣称号。今年他们又在去年胜利的基础上继续前进，1至9月份，他们全队共生产原油十万多吨，超过计划产量四千八百三十一吨，比去年同期产量增加三倍。原油成本逐月下降，最低月份成本比国家计划指标降低19.5％，总成本比去年同期下降一半。
    人人管理油井
    青年采油二队所以能够不断跃进，月月超产，主要经验是他们在生产中坚持了政治挂帅，以党支部为核心，全队党、政、工、团拧成一股劲，充分发动群众，充分发挥了职工群众的积极性。
    油田的管理，全靠系统地掌握油井资料，科学地分析、判断每口油井的油层情况。过去油井的资料是由几个工程技术员掌握的，加上油井发展很快，少数工程技术员就不可能做到及时、清楚地了解每口井的情况，及时正确地解决生产中的问题。而工人呢，他们一天到晚和油井打交道，哪口井“调皮”，哪口井不“调皮”，都摸得清清楚楚。党支部研究了这一情况后，就在全队提出了把油井资料下放给工人管理，让“人人关心油井，个个分析油井，当好油田主人”的口号。同时，又组织全队职工进行鸣放辩论，使每个工人都懂得掌握油井资料的意义。同时，又批判了“工人管理不了油井”的保守思想。就这样，全队的青年工人开始了油井资料的管理工作。
    工人们管理油井资料以后，一个“人人关心油井，个个分析油井”的生动活泼的局面迅速出现了。许多工人平时发现油井有什么变化，下了班连工作服也不脱，饭也不吃，就急忙向小队汇报，研究解决的办法。为了及时计算油气量，许多工人自动买了计算尺，很快学会了使用；各个计量站的职工经常自动召开“三结合”会，对油井进行分析。
    为了更好地管理油井，小队技术人员和工人们一起，还把每口井从钻井到采油过程中的原始资料和生产中得到的一切资料，归纳起来写成了油井史，建立了油井档案。工人们发现有的井缺少原始资料，就主动地到处找人搜集、了解过去油井完井时的情况，并从井下取样分析，很快地使全队做到了井井有档案，站站有资料。开展竞赛　大闹革新
    开展群众性的劳动竞赛，大搞技术革新与技术革命，是采油二队增产原油的重要方法。全队在高产、优质、安全生产的口号下，组织了站与站、个人与个人之间的劳动竞赛，有力地推动了油井管理水平的提高。如首夺红旗的第二十二站，由于干劲充沛，工作主动，有严密的制度，油井管理工作有条不紊，切实做到了高产、优质、安全生产。第十八站为了赶上二十二站，几次召开全站生产会进行研究，通过五天努力，大搞油井管理档案资料，终于使各项工作赶上了二十二站，夺得了红旗。
    随着劳动竞赛的开展，技术革新与技术革命的活动也就活跃起来。今年1至9月，全队共提出合理化建议九十八项，在增产原油节约钢材方面解决了很大问题。如油井出油管线利用油井喷出来的天然气进行烟道土坑保温，解决了冬季冰、蜡、胶堵塞出油管现象，节约了锅炉和管线；简化井口装置，大大节约了高压闸门。就这一项，每口井可为国家节省四千元投资。制成油嘴沉水器，解决了油嘴冰堵现象，保证了冬季正常出油。创造了放空原油回收器，杜绝了检查油嘴时放空原油的浪费。这些革新，有力地保证了月月超产。
    加强企业管理工作，是采油二队不断降低成本的重要原因。为了充分发挥全队工人参加企业管理的主动性和积极性，今年3月，全队在党支部领导下，扩大了管理机构，建立了四大员（工资员、材料员、成本员、资产员）制度，成立了企业管理小组。队的政治指导员亲自挂帅，担任企业管理小组长，定期开会，研究解决工作中的具体问题。工人参加企业管理，责任心特别强。工作中处处表现了当家作主精神，处处关心成本，事事注意节约，哪怕用一根管子都要精打细算，完全扭转了以往领料无计划、无控制等混乱现象，杜绝了浪费，使原油成本大大下降。今年原油每吨成本比去年下降了40％。
    目前采油二队全体职工正继续反对右倾思想，以更大的干劲，创造新成绩，争取提前跨进1960年。
