Zhan Shuijing, a seventh-grade lathe operator at the Dalian Shipyard, has been with the factory for eleven years and eleven months, from November 25, 1947, to the present. During this long period, he has used large lathes, small lathes, new lathes, and old lathes. The thousands upon thousands of large and small jobs he has machined are mostly precision and important parts of ships, with a precision requirement generally not exceeding half the thickness of a hair. However, Zhan Shuijing has consistently maintained the quality of every product, never producing a defective product or a rework.

Zhan Shuijing is not one to "take his time to produce fine work." During the First Five-Year Plan period, he completed seven years and eight months' worth of work in five years. In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, he completed twenty months' worth of work. From January to August of this year, although he spent more than two months attending meetings and visiting the Soviet Union, he still completed one year and one day's worth of work.

From "Leaving a Name Behind" to a Sense of Responsibility as a Master

The reason why Zhan Shuijing is able to maintain consistently high production and quality is not because of many favorable objective conditions, but because he has firmly established a high sense of responsibility as a master, meticulously treating product quality, and consistently adhering to advanced experiences in ensuring product quality. Over the past ten years, he has worked on six large and small lathes, including more than seven years on two old-fashioned belt-driven lathes older than himself. Although the lathes were old and broken, he made very precise important parts for ship engines. In his own words: "Although the lathe is old, the product cannot be rough. Whether it is a large part or a small job, every part is the lifeline of the ship. If a poor-quality part is installed on the ship, and a problem occurs at sea due to the winds and waves, it is not a joke. It involves people, ships, and cargo. Those of us who manufacture the parts ourselves must be responsible to the country and the people!" Zhan Shuijing strictly demands this of himself, never letting a single defective product slip through his hands.

Zhan Shuijing's understanding of ensuring product quality has gone through a process of transformation. He is from Shaoxing, Zhejiang. He came from a poor family and became an apprentice at an iron factory at the age of thirteen, suffering beatings and exploitation from the capitalists. He did not graduate until he was twenty. Counting to the present, he has thirty years of experience. Zhan Shuijing jumped around to many factories in the old society. After liberation, he came to work at the Dalian Shipyard. At the time, he did not think he would stay here for long. However, he had an idea about ensuring product quality: "Working should be like working. As a craftsman, it's too embarrassing to produce defective products! As the saying goes, geese leave a sound, people leave a name. Even if I don't stay here for long, I want others to say that I am 'good'." At that time, his attitude towards product quality stemmed from this kind of individualism. Later, under the education of the Party, and through several political movements, he continuously improved his ideological awareness, understood the relationship between the factory and himself, and realized that today's work is for himself. Since workers are the masters, then producing defective products is not just a matter of personal appearance, but will cause huge waste to the country, affect the timely completion of production plans, hinder the development of national construction, and even affect the improvement of people's lives. Therefore, Zhan Shuijing began to have a clear understanding of the important significance of ensuring product quality.

In 1950, the factory conducted a major quality inspection. The leadership calculated in detail that scrapping a large steam valve would waste 10,000 yuan for the country; scrapping a copper nut would cost four or five jiao. This was a great inspiration to Zhan Shuijing. He thought: If a child breaks a bowl at home, it's a heartache, why don't you feel the pain when you ruin a part in the factory? Its loss can be worth many bowls! If we go to the store to buy something, we always want to pick a good one, even if the product has no problems, we have to pick it apart; why should we be so careless when we work? If we don't pay attention to product quality, then we are arbitrarily causing waste to the country!

Discovering Rules in Production, Learning Experience from the Masses

After Zhan Shuijing had a clear understanding of the important significance of ensuring product quality, he devoted himself to thinking about ways to ensure product quality, and gained experience. Over the past ten years, under the guidance and cultivation of the Party, and with the help and support of the masses, he has summarized five experiences in ensuring product quality, which are:

First, do a good job of preparation before production, care about product quality, and fight against phenomena that cause poor quality.

Zhan Shuijing regards doing a good job of preparation before production as the first step in ensuring product quality. In addition to measuring the parts he receives several times, preparing the necessary tools and cutting tools, correcting the accuracy of the measuring tools, and thoroughly understanding the requirements of the orderers, he also conducts a serious, meticulous, and strict inspection of the drawings. Because the dimensions marked on the drawings are often unclear and easy to misread. For example, the numbers "5" and "3" and "8", "7" and "1", "9" and "0" are the most difficult to distinguish. If you glance at the drawing, you will most likely make a mistake. When Zhan Shuijing inspects the drawings, he always makes sure to see the numbers clearly before he starts working. If there is anything unclear, he must figure it out, and never relies on "experience" or "approximations" to do "approximate" work. In order to ensure quality, he never shies away from difficulties. Once, he received three misaligned connecting rods. When looking at the drawings, he found that the necks of the rods were too thin. He went to the scheduler to check with the design department, but the designer said: "How does Zhan Shuijing know that the necks are too thin? Tell him to do it according to the drawings, there is no mistake." At this time, some workers also said: "Just do it, Lao Zhan, you won't be held responsible if there is a problem, you have the drawings!" But Zhan Shuijing believed that personal responsibility was a small matter, and the country's loss from a scrapped product was a big matter. As a result, after checking and comparing it three times, it turned out that the drawing was indeed drawn six centimeters too thin.

Second, do not be careless when working, put all your energy and attention into the work, be meticulous when doing precision work, and be very careful when doing rough work, measure frequently, look frequently, and check frequently.

After doing a good job of preparation before production, Zhan Shuijing puts all his attention into the work. By analyzing the reasons why some workers in the workshop produce defective products, he discovered the following problems: some people make new products and are unfamiliar with the work, but do not produce defective products, but they produce defective products when making old products; workers of the same grade, doing the same work, those who use old machine tools do not produce defective products, but those who use new machine tools mess up the work; low-grade workers and high-grade workers do the same work, sometimes high-grade workers make mistakes; no defective products are produced on weekdays, but some people are prone to producing defective products on Saturdays or Mondays; some people do large batches of work, the first few are of good quality, but then quality accidents occur. Therefore, he concluded that the main reason for the production of defective products is not low technical skill or lack of experience, but carelessness and lack of concentration. Therefore, when he does every job, he concentrates his energy, and for every dimension, every tolerance, and every place of the part, he measures frequently, looks frequently, and checks frequently; he keeps the process regulations and quality standards firmly in his mind, does not seek convenience, does not take shortcuts, improves ideas that can be improved, and resolutely implements ideas that cannot be improved, achieving careful operation and accurate work.

Third, ask if you don't understand, ask for advice, learn modestly, improve your skills; be good at learning from the experiences of others, and even more so be good at learning from the lessons of others, and don't be someone who pretends to understand what they don't understand and works blindly.

Zhan Shuijing often says: "What one person knows is not as much as what everyone knows; one person's strength is not as strong as the strength of a group of people. Asking more questions when walking can help you avoid detours; asking for more advice when working can enrich your own experience." Therefore, in the long-term production practice, he has summarized an experience: "The masses are my teachers, the masses are the creators of experience, and we must constantly learn from the masses in order to gradually improve our technical level." Once, he received a batch of generator cores, which he had never done before and had no experience. So, Zhan Shuijing humbly asked Zhang Liande, who was much lower in grade than him but often did this kind of work. As a result, under Zhang Liande's guidance, he successfully completed the task.

Fourth, unite and help each other, improve together, hand over shifts clearly, take over shifts clearly, and do a good job of mutual assistance in the same bed, so that three people are of one mind, and jointly ensure product quality.

Zhan Shuijing attaches particular importance to unity and mutual assistance among comrades and workers in the same bed in production, which is also an important experience for him to ensure product quality. Every time Zhan Shuijing hands over a shift, he explains the work, tools, drawings, and cutting tools to the comrade taking over the shift clearly, and suggests how to do the next step quickly and well before going home; he also takes over the shift very carefully, and clarifies anything he doesn't understand. Once, he sharpened a knife during the day shift, and fearing that the blade would be damaged by others, he wrapped it in cloth and put it next to the box. He forgot about this when handing over the shift and went home. While eating, he suddenly remembered that he had not handed over the knife, so he rushed back to the factory and found the knife for the next shift worker, Lu Hengzhen. Lao Lu, a worker in the same bed, often said: "To achieve unity, no one can be selfish. Zhan Shuijing is not selfish. The three of us work with one heart for the quality and quantity of products, and for the completion of the task." Recently, Zhan Shuijing and veteran technician Zhang Riliang and young worker Zhou Chuanrui worked on a large electrified lathe. Once, they received three sets of large crankshafts for ship engines, and the task was urgent, requiring them to be completed ahead of schedule. The three of them studied together. Zhan Shuijing suggested that several processes could be reduced; Zhang Riliang and Zhou Chuanrui also proposed several methods. As a result, they completed the task that required twenty-one days and nights in six days and nights. Because they learned from each other and helped each other, not a single defective product has been produced on their lathe since last year.

Fifth, strictly abide by operating procedures, take care of machinery and equipment, abide by labor discipline, and achieve safe production.

In more than ten years, Zhan Shuijing has never been absent from work without reason, nor has he had any personal or machine tool accidents. The main reason is that he strictly abides by operating procedures and labor discipline. He often says: "Operating procedures have a certain theoretical basis, and they also include the practical experience of many of our workers. Abiding by them and implementing them is both respecting science and respecting oneself, and it can effectively ensure product quality."

In the past two or three years, he has also continuously improved processes and operating procedures, and proposed and implemented more than 20 major technical innovation suggestions. Zhan Shuijing is also a model in taking care of machinery and equipment. When he is working and after work, he always wipes the lathe clean, arranges the tools neatly, and often pays attention to checking the operation of the machine tool and solves problems in time.

Although Comrade Zhan Shuijing has not produced a single defective product for nearly twelve years, he is never proud or complacent in his daily production and life. He is humble and prudent, works diligently, and regards his achievements as a result of the Party's cultivation and the masses' help. He said: "Ensuring excellent product quality is not a matter of one day or half a day, nor is it something that can be done with intermittent enthusiasm." He said that in future production, he will always pay attention to product quality, maintain the honor of not producing defective products, and contribute all his strength to the construction of socialism and communism.

    詹水晶十一年不出废品
    大连造船厂七级车工詹水晶，从1947年11月25日入厂到现在，已经十一年零十一个月了。在这漫长的岁月里，大床子、小床子、新床子、旧床子他都用过，经他的手车出来的成千成万件大活小活，绝大部分是船上的精密、重要部件，精密度一般要求不能超过半根头发丝那么粗。但詹水晶始终如一，保持着产品件件优质，一直没有出过废品和返手活。
    詹水晶并不是“慢工出细活”的人，他在第一个五年计划期间，五年完成了七年零八个月的工作量；在大跃进的1958年里完成了二十个月的工作量；今年1月到8月，虽然因为参加会议和赴苏联参观访问占去了两个多月的时间，但也还是完成了一年零一天的工作量。从“人过留名”到主人翁的责任感
    詹水晶所以能够保持月月高产、件件优质，决不是客观上有很多有利条件，而是他在思想上牢固地树立了对待产品质量一丝不苟的高度的主人翁责任感，始终不懈地坚持执行保证产品质量的先进经验。十多年来，他先后在六台大小车床上干过活，其中在两台寿命比他的年纪还大的旧式皮带车床上就干了七年多。尽管车床是破旧的，但是，他却做出了十分精密的轮船主机重要部件。用他自己的话说：“车床虽然破旧，产品却不容许粗拉，不管是大件是小活，每一个部件都是船上的命根子，如果把质量不好的部件安装在船上，一旦在海上经不住大风大浪的考验而发生了问题，这可不是闹着玩的事儿，又是人，又是船，又是货物。我们亲手制造部件的人，一定要对国家、对人民负责！”詹水晶就是这样严格要求自己，从来不让一件废品从他手底下溜过去。
    詹水晶对保证产品质量在认识上是有一段转变过程的。他是浙江绍兴人，从小家境贫穷，十三岁就跑到一家铁工厂学徒，受尽了资本家的打骂和剥削，一直学了七年才出师，算到现在他已经有三十年的工龄了。詹水晶在旧社会曾跳过很多厂子，解放后来到大连造船厂工作。他当时认为在这里也不一定能干长远。但是，他对保证产品质量却有一个想法：“干活就得像个干活的样儿，做一个手艺人，出了废品多难看！俗语说得好，雁过留声，人过留名，这里干不长，走了以后也得叫别人说我一个‘好’字。”他当时对待产品质量就是从这种个人主义出发的。以后他在党的教育下，并通过几次政治运动，不断地提高了自己的思想觉悟，懂得了工厂和自己的关系，认识到今天干活是给自己干的，工人既然当家作主，那么出废品就不是个人好看不好看的问题，而是会给国家造成巨大的浪费，会影响按期完成生产计划，会妨害国家建设事业的发展，更会影响人民生活的改善。因此，詹水晶开始对保证产品的重要意义，有了明确的认识。
    1950年，工厂进行了一次质量大检查。领导上算了一笔细账：干废一个大错汽门就会给国家浪费一万元；干废一个铜螺丝帽也要四、五角钱。这对詹水晶的启示很大，他想：在家里要是孩子打碎了一个碗，都心痛得了不得，为什么在工厂干废一个活就不心痛呢？它的损失能顶上多少个碗啊！如果我们到商店去买东西，总是想挑个好的，哪怕商品没有毛病也要东挑西拣；自己有什么理由干活凑付呢？如果自己不重视产品质量，那就是任意给国家造成浪费！在生产中摸规律，向群众学经验
    詹水晶对保证产品质量的重要意义有了明确的认识以后，就日夜为保证产品质量动脑筋，想办法，摸经验。十多年来，他在党的教导和培养下，在群众的帮助和支持下，总结出了保证产品质量的五条经验，这就是：
    第一，做好生产前的准备工作，关心产品质量，和造成质量低劣的现象进行斗争。
    詹水晶把做好生产前的准备工作看成是保证产品质量的第一步。他除了把领来的活先量几遍，把需用的工具、刀具准备妥当，校正量具的精度，把订货主的要求领会透彻以外，特别对图纸进行认真、细致、严格的检查。因为图纸上标的尺寸往往使人看不清楚，很容易看错。例如：“5”和“3”和“8”、“7”和“1”、“9”和“0”等数字最不容易弄清楚，如果看图纸一眼而过，多半会出漏子。而詹水晶在检查图纸的时候，总是先把数字看清楚才下手干活，如果有含糊的地方，他一定要搞清楚，从来不凭“经验”、“大约摸”来干“大概”活。为了保证质量，他也从不回避困难。有一次他接到三根错汽拉杆，在看图纸的时候发现杆子的脖颈过细，他就去找调度员到设计科查一查，但设计员说：“詹水晶怎么知道脖颈细了，叫他照图纸干没有错。”这时也有些工人说：“干吧老詹，出了问题也找不着你，有图纸在！”可是詹水晶却认为，个人负责事小，造成废品国家损失事大，结果经过他三番两次的查对，果然图纸上划细了六厘米。
    第二，干活时不马虎大意，把全部精力和心思都放在活上，干精密活要一丝不苟，干粗拉活也要十分用心，勤量、勤看、勤检查。
    做好生产前的准备工作以后，詹水晶就把心思全部放在活上。他通过分析车间里有的工人出废品的原因，发现了这样的问题：有的人做新产品，活生，但不出废品，但是做老产品却出了废品；同样等级的工人，干同样的活，使用旧机床的不出废品，而用新机床的倒把活干坏了；低等级工人和高等级工人干同样活，有时高等级工人却出了漏子；平日不出废品，而有的人一到星期六或星期一就容易出废品；有的人干大批活，头几个质量很好，以后就出现了质量事故。因此他得出的结论是：产生废品的主要原因，不是技术低，经验少，而是马虎粗心，思想不集中。所以他在干每一件活时，都是精神贯注，对部件的每一个尺码，每一个公差，每一个地方，都做到勤量、勤看、勤检查；对工艺规程和质量标准，都牢牢地记在脑子里，不贪图省事，不走歪歪道，能改进的想法改进，不能改进的坚决执行，做到了精心操作，干活准确。
    第三，不懂就问，多多请教，虚心学习，提高技术；善于学习别人的经验，更要善于吸取别人的教训，不做不懂装懂、闷着头瞎干的人。
    詹水晶常说：“一个人知道的东西毕竟不如大家知道的多；一个人的力量再大也顶不上一群人有劲。走路多问一问就可以少走弯路；干活多请教就能丰富自己的经验。”因此，他在长期的生产实践中总结出一条经验：“群众是我的老师，群众是经验的创造者，必须不断地向群众学习，才能逐渐提高自己的技术水平”有一次他接到车一批发电机芯子，这活他从来没干过，没有经验。于是，詹水晶就去虚心请教比他等级低得多，但是却经常干这种活的张连德，结果在张连德的指导下，很顺利地完成了任务。
    第四，团结互助，共同提高，交班清楚，接班明确，搞好同床互助，使三个人一条心，做到共同保证产品质量。
    詹水晶在生产中特别重视同志间和同床工人的团结互助，这也是他保证产品质量的一条重要经验。詹水晶每在交班的时候，都是把活、工具、图纸、刀具等对接班的同志说得清清楚楚，提出下一步怎样干能快能好，然后才回家；他接班也十分细致，不懂就弄明白。有一次，他在白班时磨了一把刀，怕被别人碰坏了刀刃，就用布包起来放在箱子边上。他交班时忘了这码事，就回家了。正吃着饭，忽然想起来还有这把刀没交班，于是，急忙回到厂把刀找给下一班工人卢恒珍。同床工人老卢常说：“要想搞好团结，谁都不能抱私心，詹水晶就不抱私心，我们三个人干活就一心为产品的质量和数量着想，为完成任务着想。”最近詹水晶和老技术工人张日良、青年工人周传瑞在一台大型电气化车床上工作，有一次他们接到三组轮船上用的主机大曲拐轴，任务很急，要求提前完成。他们三个人就共同研究，詹水晶提出可以减少几道工序；张日良和周传瑞也提出几条办法，结果，六昼夜完成了需要二十一昼夜才能完成的任务。由于他们互相学习，互相帮助，从去年到现在，在他们那台床子上一件废品也没产生。
    第五，严格遵守操作规程，爱护机器设备，遵守劳动纪律，做到安全生产。
    詹水晶在十多年的时间里，从来没有无故缺勤，也没有发生过人身与机床事故，主要原因是严格遵守操作规程和劳动纪律。他常这样说：“操作规程是有一定理论根据的，里面也包括着我们多少工人的实际经验，遵守它，执行它，既是尊重科学，又是尊重自己，还能切实保证产品质量。”
    最近两三年里，他还不断改进工艺、操作规程，提出并实现了重大的技术革新建议二十多项。在爱护机器设备方面，詹水晶也是一个模范。他在干活时和下了班，总是把车床擦得干干净净，把工具整理得有条有理，经常注意检查机床的运转情况，发现问题及时解决。
    詹水晶同志虽然将近十二年没出一件废品，但是，他在日常生产和生活中，从不骄傲自满。他谦虚谨慎，兢兢业业，把自己的成绩看成是党的培养和群众帮助的结果。他说：“保证产品质量优良，不是一朝半日的事情，更不是忽冷忽热可以办到的事情。”他表示要在今后的生产中，时刻重视产品质量，保持不出废品的荣誉，为建设社会主义和共产主义贡献出自己的全部力量。
