	New Glory for Clay Molding
	Clay molding, a traditional Chinese craft passed down from ancient times, is now radiating brilliance in socialist construction. Using clay molding to cast certain castings results in higher output and better quality compared to sand molding, and can save a significant amount of molding materials and cleaning labor. The widespread promotion of this method will play a major role in increasing the output of castings in the machinery industry.
	In recent months, clay molding has seen many new developments, its applications are expanding, and the castings are becoming larger, evolving from only being able to cast iron to also being able to cast steel. For example, in Anshan, 80% of the machinery factories are promoting clay molding for over 100 products, generally increasing output by threefold and reducing costs by half. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Southern Machine Repair Plant used clay molding to cast large steelmaking slag pots weighing 28 tons, increasing efficiency by thirteen times compared to sand molding. The Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant uses clay molding to produce steel castings for "bolsters," saving 10,000 tons of sand annually, speeding up the production cycle by five times, reducing molding costs by about 90%, and saving more than half of the labor hours. Truly, the ancient tree blossoms with new flowers, blooming ever more profusely.

    泥型铸造的新光彩
    我国古代遗传下来的土工艺——泥型铸造，在社会主义建设中大放异彩。用泥型铸造某些铸件，比用砂型铸产量高，质量好，能节省大量造型材料和清理工时。这个办法普遍推广后，对提高机械工业铸件的产量将起很大作用。
    近几个月来，泥型铸造又有许多新的发展，应用范围越来越宽，铸件越来越大，由只能铸铁进而也能铸钢。如鞍山市已经有百分之八十的机械工厂在一百多种产品上推广泥型铸造，一般产量提高三倍，成本降低一半。鞍钢南部机修厂用泥型铸出了重达二十八吨的炼钢大渣罐，比用砂型的效率提高十三倍。沈阳机车车辆厂用泥型生产铸钢件“摇枕”，一年可节省一万吨砂子，生产周期加快五倍，造型成本降低百分之九十左右，节省工时一半以上。真是古树新花，越开越盛。
