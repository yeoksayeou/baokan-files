    One, Two, Three, Four, Five Movement

    The One, Two, Three, Four, Five Movement is being carried out in the vast rural areas of Gansu.

    The One, Two, Three, Four, Five Movement was proposed by Secretary Zhang Zhongliang at the Gansu Provincial Six-Level Cadre Conference. Its full content is: One Breakthrough (breakthrough from the first ten days of the month to the last ten days, from the previous month to the next month, from the previous season to the next season, from this year to next year), Two Revolutions (technical innovation and technical revolution), Three Surpasses (actual production surpasses planned production, labor surpasses quotas, the backward surpass the advanced), Four Comparisons (compare drive, compare measures, compare progress, compare actual results), Five Achievements (competitions become a network, experiences become complete sets, models become rows, red flags become forests, mutual aid becomes a trend). Five sentences and ten words express the heart of the people of Gansu continuing to leap forward. It is also the fruitful result of this year's Great Leap Forward!

    We need "Breakthroughs," we need "Revolutions," we need "Surpasses," we need "Comparisons," we need "Achievements." These are our new goals on the broad road of the Great Leap Forward. From this, it can be seen that the people building socialism will never stop their rushing footsteps and will never put away their flying wings. Right-leaning opportunists clamor "It's all a mess," and "Fanaticism," and our answer to them is the One, Two, Three, Four, Five Movement. We must make the mass movement even more fervent and make the cause of socialism even more fervent. Judging from the content included in the One, Two, Three, Four, Five Movement, it is not only "fervent" but also has real effort and measures to ensure the leap forward. It will push rural production to a new climax.

    1960 is rushing towards us. Let us ride on the steed of the "One, Two, Three, Four, Five Movement," sing loudly, and meet it head-on!

### 一、二、三、四、五运动

    一、二、三、四、五运动
    甘肃白银农林水利局　吴刚
    在甘肃的广大农村正在开展一、二、三、四、五运动。
    一、二、三、四、五运动是甘肃省六级干部会上张仲良书记讲话中提出来的。它的全文是：一跨（上旬跨下旬，上月跨下月，前季跨后季，今年跨明年），二革（技术革新和技术革命），三超（实产超计划，劳动超定额，后进超先进），四比（比干劲，比措施，比进度，比实效），五成（竞赛成网，经验成套，标兵成列，红旗成林，互助成风）。五句话、十个字，就道出了甘肃人民继续跃进的心声。它也是今年跃进结的硕果！
    我们需要“跨”，我们需要“革”，我们需要“超”，我们需要“比”，我们需要“成”。这是我们在大跃进的康庄大道上新的目标。由此可见，建设社会主义的人们，是永远不会停止飞奔的脚步，永远不会收起飞翔的双翼的。右倾机会主义者叫嚷“糟得很”，“狂热性”，我们回答他们的就是一、二、三、四、五运动。我们要把群众运动搞的更热火，要把社会主义事业搞的更热火。从一、二、三、四、五运动包含的内容看，还不仅是“热”，还有实劲，还有保证跃进的措施，它会把农村的生产推向新的高潮。
    1960年扑面而来，让我们跨在“一二三四五运动”的骏马上，高歌猛进，迎上前去吧！
