Financial and trade work's political viewpoint, production viewpoint, and mass viewpoint.

Ouyang Qin, First Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

Politics is the concentrated expression of economics, productive activity is the most basic practical activity of mankind, and the masses are the creators of history; these are the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, political, production, and mass perspectives are fundamental viewpoints that the Party must emphasize in all its work. Since financial and trade work is an important component of the entire national economy, a complex economic undertaking with strong policy implications, and has the broadest, most direct, closest, and most sensitive connections to industrial and agricultural production and the lives of the broad masses, it is particularly necessary to emphasize these three perspectives in financial and trade work. Since the rectification movement of 1957, the political, production, and mass perspectives in our province's financial and trade work have been significantly strengthened. This is the fundamental reason for the tremendous achievements and unprecedented dynamism in financial and trade work. Fundamentally, many important experiences in our province's financial and trade work are the result of implementing these three perspectives under the guidance of the spirit of the General Line. Facts have proven that as long as we conscientiously implement the principle of putting politics in command, adhere to the policy of starting from production and promoting production, and implement the mass line, the face of financial and trade work will be completely renewed, and our work will achieve great results. Conversely, if we ignore the Party's lines, principles, and policies, blur the viewpoint of class struggle, do not start from production, do not use the promotion of production as the guiding principle for financial and trade work, and lack a mass perspective or only see the masses' immediate and local interests, without considering the masses' long-term and fundamental interests, our work will make mistakes and suffer losses. Therefore, in our future work, we must continue to adhere to the political, production, and mass perspectives in financial and trade work, firmly establish them in the minds of all cadres, and further develop them in our work, so as to promote financial and trade work to continue to improve significantly on the existing foundation.

To further implement the political perspective in financial and trade work, the most fundamental thing is to implement the Party's General Line of "Going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," and implement the Party's series of principles and policies in socialist revolution and construction. Financial and trade work is an important component of socialist construction, and its quality directly affects the development of production and the speed of construction. The various routine tasks of financial and trade departments, such as commercial purchasing and sales, fiscal revenue and expenditure, currency storage, and price management, are closely linked to production and construction, accumulation and consumption, the state, collectives, and individuals, and the relationships between various economic sectors and regions. These are not only economic issues but, first and foremost, political issues. The struggle between the capitalist and socialist roads is the fundamental contradiction of the transition period. Our country is still in the transition period, and classes still exist. Although the transformation of the old socio-economic system has been basically completed, it has not been thoroughly completed. Although the socio-economic system has changed, the ideological and political activities of the bourgeoisie and upper petty bourgeoisie still exist. Although its social foundation is shrinking, the stubborn habitual forces of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie still exist in society, and the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies will take a long time to eliminate. Therefore, the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads is still long-term and complex. The market is an important arena for the struggle between the two roads. As long as the struggle between the two roads exists in society, it cannot but be reflected in the thinking of the workers on the financial and trade front. Therefore, comrades on the financial and trade front must have a clear class stand and political viewpoint. In all the work of the financial and trade departments, they must accurately implement the Party's General Line and various related principles and policies. From the current situation, it is especially necessary to pay special attention to strengthening the education of cadres and workers on the General Line, education on the struggle between the two roads, and education on the principle of the "whole country as a coordinated chessboard." We must resolutely criticize and overcome right-leaning thinking, right-leaning activities, capitalist business ideas, and various decentralist and localist errors in all work and in the struggle between the two roads. We must transform the bourgeois world outlook and methodology of some cadres, and further improve the ideological level of all financial and trade cadres, so that financial and trade work can better serve the General Line.

The fundamental task of implementing the Party's General Line for socialist construction in financial and trade work is to start from production and, through circulation and distribution, promote the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. This is also the fundamental requirement for implementing the production viewpoint in financial and trade work. As early as 1942, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the policy of "developing the economy and ensuring supply" for financial and economic work. This instruction concisely and clearly explained the relationship between production and consumption and the task of financial and trade work. Financial and trade work is the link connecting various production departments, production and consumption, industry and agriculture, and urban and rural areas. Its function is mainly to serve economic development and people's lives in terms of circulation and distribution. Production, of course, plays a decisive role in circulation and distribution, but circulation and distribution, in turn, have a huge impact on production. In order to continuously expand reproduction and promote the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, not only must we give full play to the role of the production link, but we must also give full play to the role of the circulation link. To this end, financial and trade work must continue to be carried out in accordance with the principle of starting from production, doing a good job in circulation and distribution, promoting production development, and ensuring the needs of ever-increasing consumption. Practice in recent years has proven that starting from production and promoting production must start from the following three aspects: 1. Promoting production through economic activities of circulation and distribution, which is fundamental; 2. Cooperating with all parties to participate in the planning and arrangement of production; 3. Under unified planning, establishing commodity production bases, providing typical demonstrations, and driving production. These three aspects are interconnected and indispensable. The main task of financial and trade departments is circulation and distribution. It would be wrong to abandon one's main task and simply engage in production. However, if financial and trade work is isolated from production, simply engaging in purchasing, sales, transfer, and storage, without engaging in necessary production organization activities, passively waiting and watching, and "waiting for rabbits by a tree stump," that would also be one-sided and wrong. Production, supply, and sales are an inseparable whole. Industry, agriculture, and commerce must have both division of labor and combination. In recent years, our province's financial and trade work has not only supported and promoted industrial and agricultural production through economic means such as purchasing and sales activities and capital allocation, but also actively participated in organizing and promoting production, and directly operated a number of demonstrative productions. As a result, it has promoted the development of light and chemical industries and diversified rural operations, and initially established a strong commodity production and supply base network, giving play to the active role of financial and trade work in the development of the national economy. Practice has proven that this approach is correct and successful. The view that financial and trade departments participating in and organizing production is "not doing their job properly" or "meddling in other people's affairs" is wrong.

In order to better implement the production viewpoint, comrades in financial and trade departments should further develop the spirit of proactive cooperation and support for all parties. They should often understand the situation of industrial and agricultural production, closely care for and assist the development of industrial and agricultural production, actively and proactively tap potential, expand fiscal revenue, increase construction funds, promptly organize the supply of means of production, purchase and promote industrial products and agricultural and sideline products, and contact all parties to participate in the planning and arrangement of the production of commodities necessary for society, so as to ensure the needs of production and people's lives. Behaviors that hinder production, such as only being responsible for sales and not raw materials, only caring about the present and not the long-term, only seeking profit and not production, picking and choosing, and suppressing grades and prices, must continue to be criticized and overcome. Of course, industrial and agricultural production departments must also actively cooperate with financial and trade departments, strive to increase production and practice economy, actively improve quality, and reduce costs, so that their products meet the needs of the people.

Financial and trade work, like other work, must establish a firm mass perspective, care about the interests of the masses, and wholeheartedly serve production and consumers, preventing and overcoming various coercive orders and behaviors that seek only profit and harm the interests of the masses. The interests of the Party and the interests of the masses are completely consistent. All the Party's policies are based on the interests of the masses. All communists and revolutionary cadres should serve the masses with full enthusiasm, share the fate and breathe the same air as the masses at all times, care about the sufferings of the masses, and safeguard the interests of the masses. However, caring about the interests of the masses requires considering the long-term, fundamental, and temporary interests of the masses, the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, and the overall and partial interests in a unified way, and not opposing them to each other, emphasizing one aspect in isolation. In particular, it must be clearly recognized that building socialism is the greatest and most fundamental interest of all the people. Therefore, we must never only care about the individual, immediate, and partial interests of the masses, and disregard the interests of the state and the whole people. Doing so would essentially undermine the fundamental interests of the masses and would foster the growth of localism, individualism, and even capitalist spontaneous tendencies among the masses, corroding the socialist consciousness of cadres and the masses, and cannot be equated with the mass perspective at all.

An important aspect of adhering to the mass perspective in financial and trade work is to implement the Party's mass line and vigorously carry out mass movements. Since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, under the leadership of the Party, our province's financial and trade work has boldly mobilized the masses, launching a mass movement involving millions of peasants in the purchasing of agricultural and sideline products, ensuring the completion of the purchasing tasks in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way. Within enterprises, we have implemented the "three participations and one reform," that is, the system of cadres participating in labor, workers participating in management, and residents participating in supervision, reformed some unreasonable rules and regulations, and widely launched the socialist competition of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced," greatly developing the enthusiasm of the workers and masses, strengthening the democratic management of enterprises, and improving the level of enterprise management, thereby ensuring the completion and over-completion of plans. All of these are concrete applications of the Party's mass line in financial and trade work. The adoption of these mass line methods has given financial and trade work a broad mass base, fundamentally changing the face of financial and trade work. Practice has proven that not only should we vigorously carry out mass movements in production departments, but we should also vigorously carry out mass movements in financial and trade departments. At the same time, because financial and trade work has close ties with millions of people, we should not only vigorously carry out mass movements within enterprises, but also combine these mass movements with mass movements in society, mobilizing the broad masses to participate in, support, and supervise financial and trade work. Only in this way can we cooperate with and promote the mass movements of production departments, so that they can continue to develop, implement the Party's General Line for socialist construction, and form a continuous leap forward in the entire national economy. The view that only production departments can carry out mass movements and financial and trade departments cannot carry out mass movements, or the statement that, under the pretext of individual shortcomings in mass movements, slander the mass movements in financial and trade departments as "messing things up" and "creating chaos" is completely wrong. In order to further improve financial and trade work and ensure the realization of a continuous leap forward, we must smash the attacks of right-wing opportunists, criticize the right-leaning thinking of not daring to vigorously carry out mass movements in financial and trade departments, and continue to use and develop the rich experience since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, and continue to vigorously carry out mass movements under the unified leadership of the Party.

In short, in order to better implement the political, production, and mass perspectives, financial and trade work must continue to implement the Party's General Line for socialist construction, starting from production, and actively and proactively support the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production through circulation and distribution, support the mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification of agriculture, the industrialization of communes, support the comprehensive and major development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries with grain as the key link, support the construction of new steel and oil bases, support and promote the development of light and chemical industries, supply the ever-increasing needs of urban and rural people, continue to carry out mass movements to increase production and practice economy, and strive to comprehensively and over-fulfill various planned targets of financial and trade work, so as to create more favorable conditions for the continued leap forward of the entire national economy.

    财贸工作的政治观点、生产观点和群众观点问题
    中共黑龙江省委第一书记　欧阳钦
    政治是经济的集中表现，生产活动是人类最基本的实践活动，群众是历史的创造者，这是马克思列宁主义的基本原理。因此，政治观点、生产观点、群众观点，乃是党在一切工作中都必须强调的根本观点。由于财贸工作是整个国民经济的重要组成部分，是一种复杂的、政策性很强的经济工作，与工农业生产，与广大群众的生活，有最广泛、最直接、最密切、最敏感的联系，所以在财贸工作中尤其需要特别强调这三个观点。从1957年整风运动以来，我省财贸工作的政治观点、生产观点和群众观点有显著的加强，这是财贸工作取得巨大成绩、工作空前活跃的根本原因。我省财贸工作的许多重要经验，从根本上来说也都是在总路线的精神指导下贯彻执行这三个观点的结果。事实证明，只要认真地实行政治挂帅，贯彻执行从生产出发、促进生产的方针，贯彻执行群众路线，财贸工作的面貌就会焕然一新，工作就会取得巨大的成绩。反之，如果忽视了党的路线、方针和政策，模糊了阶级斗争的观点，不从生产出发，不以促进生产为财贸工作的指针，没有群众观点或者只看到群众的眼前利益、局部利益，不从群众的长远利益、根本利益出发，我们的工作就会发生错误，遭受损失。因此我们在今后的工作中必须继续坚持财贸工作的政治观点、生产观点、群众观点，使其在全体干部的头脑中巩固地树立起来，在工作中得到进一步的发扬，以便促使财贸工作在已有的基础上，继续大大地提高一步。
    进一步贯彻财贸工作的政治观点，最根本的是要在财贸工作中贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，贯彻执行党在社会主义革命和建设中的一系列方针和政策。财贸工作是社会主义建设的重要组成部分，它的工作的好坏，直接关系到生产的发展和建设的速度。财贸部门的各种经常工作，如商业的购销、财政的收支、货币的存放、物价的管理等等，都密切地联系到生产和建设、积累和消费、国家、集体和个人、各经济部门、各地区等各方面的关系。这不仅是经济问题，首先是政治问题。资本主义和社会主义两条道路的斗争是过渡时期的基本矛盾。现在我国还处在过渡时期，阶级依然存在。旧的社会经济制度的改造虽然已经基本上完成，但尚未彻底完成。社会经济制度虽然变了，但是，资产阶级和上层小资产阶级的思想政治活动依然存在。它的社会基础虽然正在缩小，但是社会上还存在着资产阶级和小资产阶级的顽固的习惯势力，资产阶级和小资产阶级的意识形态还要很长时间才能消除。因此，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，还是长期的、复杂的。市场是两条道路斗争的重要场所，只要社会上还存在着两条道路的斗争，也就不能不反映到财贸战线的工作人员的思想中来。因此，财贸战线上的同志必须有明确的阶级立场和政治观点，在财贸部门的一切工作中，都必须准确地执行党的总路线和各种有关的方针、政策。从当前的情况看来，尤其需要特别注意加强对干部和职工进行总路线的教育，进行两条道路斗争的教育，进行全国一盘棋方针的教育，坚决批判和克服在一切工作中和在两条道路斗争中的右倾思想、右倾活动、资本主义经营思想以及各种分散主义、本位主义的错误，改造一部分干部的资产阶级的世界观和思想方法，进一步提高全体财贸干部的思想水平，使财贸工作更好地为总路线服务。
    在财贸工作中贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的根本任务是要从生产出发，通过流通和分配，促进工农业生产的继续跃进。这也就是在财贸工作中贯彻生产观点的根本要求。毛泽东同志早在1942年就对财政经济工作提出了“发展经济，保障供给”的方针，这个指示简要而明确地说明了生产和消费的关系，说明了财贸工作的任务。财贸工作是联结生产各部门、生产与消费、工业与农业、城市与乡村的纽带。它的职能主要是在流通和分配方面为经济的发展和人民生活服务。生产对于流通和分配，当然是起决定作用的，但流通和分配反过来对生产也有巨大的影响。为了不断地扩大再生产，促进工农业生产的继续跃进、不仅要充分地发挥生产环节的作用，而且必须充分地发挥流通环节的作用。为此，财贸工作必须继续按照从生产出发、作好流通和分配工作、促进生产发展、保证日益增长的消费需要这一原则来进行工作。几年来的实践证明：从生产出发、促进生产必须从以下三方面入手，即一、通过流通和分配的经济活动促进生产，这是基本的；二，协作各方，参与规划和安排生产；三、在统一规划下，建立商品生产基地，典型示范，带动生产。这三个方面是互相联系的，缺一不可的，财贸部门的主要任务是流通和分配，放弃自己的主要任务去单纯地从事生产，那当然是错误的；但如果把财贸工作和生产隔绝起来，单纯从事购销调存，不进行必要的生产组织活动，消极观望，“守株待兔”，那也是片面的和错误的。产供销是不可分割的整体，工农商既要有分工又要有结合，几年来，我省财贸工作不仅通过购销活动、资金分配等经济手段支援和促进了工农业生产，以主动的态度参与组织和促进了生产，并且直接经营了一部分示范性的生产，因而促进了轻化工业与农村多种经营的发展，初步建立了强大的商品生产供应基地网，发挥了财贸工作在发展国民经济中的能动作用。实践证明这种作法是正确的、成功的。那种认为财贸部门参与和组织生产就是“不务正业”“多管闲事”的看法是错误的。
    为了更好地贯彻生产观点，财贸部门的同志应该进一步发扬主动协作、支援各方的精神。要经常了解工农业生产的情况，密切关心和扶助工农业生产的发展；积极主动地挖掘潜力，扩大财政收入，增加建设资金；及时地组织供应生产资料，采购与推销工业品与农副产品；并联系各方，参与规划和安排社会上必需商品的生产，以保证生产和人民生活的需要。对于那种只管包销不管原料、只顾当前不顾长远、只图赢利不顾生产、挑肥拣瘦、压等压价等妨碍生产的行为，必须继续加以批判和克服。当然，工农业生产部门也必须主动与财贸部门合作，努力增产节约，积极提高质量，降低成本，使自己的产品符合于人民的需要。
    财贸工作和其他工作一样，必须树立坚强的群众观点，关心群众利益，全心全意地为生产和消费者服务，防止和克服各种强迫命令和只图赢利损害群众利益等行为，党的利益和群众的利益是完全一致的，党的一切政策都是从群众利益出发的，一切共产党员和革命干部都应该满腔热诚地为群众服务，时刻与群众同命运，共呼吸，关心群众的痛痒，维护群众的利益。但关心群众利益，是要把群众的长远利益、根本利益和暂时利益，把国家利益、集体利益和个人利益，把整体利益和局部利益，统一起来考虑，而不能把他们对立起来，孤立地强调一个方面。特别是必须明确地认识到：建设社会主义是全体人民的最大、最根本的利益，因此绝不能只顾群众的个人利益，眼前利益、局部利益、而不顾国家的、全民的利益，这样作实质上也就是破坏群众的根本利益，并且会助长群众的本位主义、个人主义以至资本主义自发倾向的滋长，腐蚀干部和群众的社会主义意识，根本不能和群众观点混为一谈。
    坚持财贸工作的群众观点的一个重要方面，是要贯彻执行党的群众路线，大搞群众运动。1958年大跃进以来，我省财贸工作在党的领导下，放手发动群众，在农副产品收购工作上掀起了有上百万农民参加的群众运动，保证了收购任务多快好省的完成；在企业内部实行了“三参一改”，即实行了干部参加劳动、职工参加管理、居民参加监督的制度，改革了一些不合理的规章制度，并广泛地开展了“比先进、学先进、赶先进”的社会主义竞赛，大大地发扬了职工群众的积极性，加强了企业的民主管理，提高了企业经营的水平，从而保证了计划的完成和超额完成，所有这些都是党的群众路线在财贸工作中的具体运用。采取了这些群众路线的方法就使财贸工作有了广泛的群众基础，从根本上改变了财贸工作的面貌。实践证明：不仅在生产部门中要大搞群众运动，而且在财贸部门中同样要大搞群众运动。同时由于财贸工作与千百万群众有密切的联系，所以不仅要在企业内部大搞群众运动，而且要把这种群众运动和社会上的群众运动结合起来，发动广大群众参与、支持和监督财贸工作。只有这样，才能配合和促进生产部门的群众运动，使其持续发展，才能贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，形成整个国民经济的继续跃进。那种认为只有生产部门能搞群众运动而财贸部门不能搞群众运动的看法，或者借口群众运动中的个别缺点来诬蔑财贸部门群众运动“搞糟了”、“搞乱了”的说法，都是完全错误的。为进一步作好财贸工作，保证实现继续跃进，我们必须粉碎右倾机会主义分子的攻击，批判不敢在财贸部门大搞群众运动的右倾思想，继续运用和发扬1958年大跃进以来的丰富经验，在党的统一领导下，继续大搞群众运动。
    总之，为了更好地贯彻政治观点、生产观点和群众观点，财贸工作要继续贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，从生产出发，通过流通和分配，积极地、主动地支援工农业生产的继续跃进，支援农业的机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化、公社工业化，支援以粮为纲的农、林、牧、副、渔全面大发展，支援新的钢铁和石油基地的建设，支援和促进轻化工业的发展，供应城乡人民日益增长的需要，继续开展群众性的增产节约运动，力争全面、超额地完成财贸工作的各项计划指标，为整个国民经济的继续跃进创造更有利的条件。
