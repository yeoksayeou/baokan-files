Xinhua News Agency, November 4th: The advanced experience exchange activities of the National "Hero Conference" organized by systems reached a new climax today. Representatives of many systems left the meeting place and went to various production units to visit and demonstrate while exchanging experiences.

Advanced producers in the textile, highway transportation, railway, light industry, foreign trade, and banking systems visited the site today to observe demonstrations, learn from each other, and provide the units they visited with new experiences. In the increasingly in-depth exchange of experiences, the representatives learned from each other and complemented each other. Many long-standing technical problems were solved, and many advanced experiences were further improved. At the experience exchange meeting held by the chemical industry system, Wen Dianhou, a representative from the Xuyong County Sulfur Factory in Sichuan, said that his factory often had a membrane forming on the surface of the pot and slag accumulating at the bottom when producing sulfur. Wen Dianhou visited several chemical factories in his county, but he was unable to find a solution. Today, after talking with Yuan Deyun in detail, Wen Dianhou was extremely happy. He said, "This time I finally found the treasure!"

At the advanced experience exchange meeting of the coal mining system, Lei Shuyun, deputy captain of the well construction team of the Chongde Coal Mine of the First Well Construction Company of Sichuan Province, spoke about his experience in implementing four-shift cross-operation in native-method mine construction. Cao Dalun, a representative from the Yangchang Engineering Office in Yunnan, immediately added to the presentation. Based on their own experiences, the two jointly answered many practical questions raised by the representatives. After Wang Fengyuan, a coal mine flitting expert from Kailuan Coal Mine, introduced his experience in quickly moving flitting equipment, representatives from Liaoning, Henan, Sichuan, and other places immediately introduced various methods for quickly moving flitting equipment based on their different working conditions.

Li Xueyi, the concrete work team leader of the Harbin Second Construction Company, who has already started working on the 1965 plan, introduced his team's experience in mastering new technologies such as pressure grouting at the experience exchange meeting of steel reinforcement concrete workers in the construction system. Pressure grouting is suitable for the foundation concrete pouring of large-scale buildings. It can eliminate the concrete mixing process, greatly reduce workers' physical labor, improve labor productivity, and ensure no honeycombing or pitting, saving 20% of cement. As soon as the break started, Ding Qingyun, the concrete youth commando captain of the Beijing Third Construction Company, immediately approached him to ask for information on pressure grouting. They have been good friends since they attended the National Advanced Producer Representative Conference together in 1956, and they often exchange advanced experiences by letter. After listening to Li Xueyi's speech today, Ding Qingyun decided to learn from Li Xueyi through this experience exchange meeting and promote it in Beijing.

After extensive and in-depth "contribution of treasures and acquisition of experiences," many representatives became more confident in achieving continued leap forward in the coming year. While continuing to conduct in-depth and meticulous exchanges of experience today, the representatives of the agricultural reclamation system launched a competition. Hou Zhengyuan, a machine farming expert from the Shihezi General Farm of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, who completed 20 years of machine farming workload in three and a half years, posted a big-character poster at the meeting today challenging tractor drivers across the country. He proposed that the workload for the next year should reach 60,000 mu per standard machine, an increase of 20% compared to this year, and achieve 20,000 hours without major repairs (the state-stipulated quota is 5,500 mu per standard machine per year, and a major repair every 10,000 hours or so). As soon as his challenge letter was posted, Hao Huanwen, a machine farming expert from the Youyi State Farm in Heilongjiang, and Jin Dechang, a model tractor driver from the 856 Farm of the Heilongjiang Railway Corps Reclamation Bureau, immediately posted big-character posters to accept his challenge. In addition to proposing new leap forward targets in machine farming and major repair periods, Hao Huanwen also guaranteed that fuel consumption would be reduced by 20% as required, and repair costs would be reduced by 50% as required. Qin Zhenzhong, a model truck driver from the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, also posted a challenge letter to truck drivers on farms across the country, guaranteeing that he would complete the entire year's driving task for 1960 in eight months under safe driving conditions.

Representatives of the geological, hydropower, forestry, aquatic, civil aviation, surveying and mapping, meteorological, cultural, educational, health, science and technology, civil affairs, and employee family systems also continued to hold meetings to exchange experiences or conduct other activities today. After two days of centralized speeches, the representatives of the commercial system divided into twelve professional groups and four comprehensive groups for meetings today. The grain system's professional groups began to transition to thematic seminars today.

    互相学习　共同提高
    群英大会交流先进经验走向深入化
    据新华社4日讯　全国“群英会”按系统进行的先进经验交流活动，今天出现了新的高潮。许多系统的代表走出会场分别去到各生产单位，一面参观表演，一面交流经验。
    纺织、公路运输、铁道、轻工、外贸、银行等系统的先进生产者，今天都到现场参观表演，相互学习，并且为他们访问的单位送去了新的经验。在越来越深入的经验交流中，代表们互相学习，互相补充，许多人长期不能解决的技术问题找到了解决办法，许多先进经验更加完善了。在化工系统分组举行的经验交流会上，四川叙永县硫磺厂代表温殿侯所在的工厂，过去生产硫磺时锅上常常出膜，锅底结渣。温殿侯跑遍了本县几个化工厂，始终没有得到解决办法。今天，温殿侯同原德云详细交谈以后，高兴得了不得。他说：“这回我总算取到宝了！”
    在煤矿系统先进经验交流会上，四川省第一建井公司崇德煤矿建井队副队长雷树云讲完在土法施工矿井中实行四班交叉作业的经验后，云南羊场工程处的代表曹大伦立刻进行补充。两人根据自己的经验，共同解答了代表们提出的许多实际问题。开滦煤矿移溜子能手王凤元介绍快速移溜子经验后，来自辽宁、河南、四川等地的代表也立刻根据各自的不同工作条件，介绍了各种各样的快速移溜子的方法。
    已经开始做1965年工作的哈尔滨第二建筑公司的混凝土工作队长李学义，在建筑系统钢筋混凝土工经验交流会上介绍了他们队努力掌握压力灌浆等新技术的经验。压力灌浆适用于大型建筑的基础混凝土浇灌。它可以免去混凝土搅拌这个工序，大大减轻工人体力劳动，提高劳动生产率，还能保证不出蜂窝麻面，节约水泥20％。休息一开始，北京市第三建筑公司的混凝土青年突击队长丁庆云马上就凑到他身边来向他要压力灌浆的资料。他们从1956年一起出席全国先进生产者代表会议以来，就成了好朋友，经常写信交流先进经验。丁庆云今天听了李学义的发言以后，就决定通过这次经验交流会好好地向李学义学一学，在北京市推广。
    经过广泛深入地“献宝取经”，许多代表对实现明年的继续跃进更加充满了信心。农垦系统的代表今天在继续深入细致交流经验的同时，开展了竞赛。曾在三年半时间内完成二十年机耕工作量的新疆生产建设兵团石河子总场的机耕能手侯正元，今天在会场上贴出了他向全国拖拉机手挑战的大字报。他提出明年工作量要达到每个标准台机耕六万亩，比今年再提高20％，并且做到两万小时不大修（国家规定的定额是一个标准台一年机耕五千五百亩，一万个小时左右一次大修）。他的挑战书刚一贴出，黑龙江国营友谊农场的机耕能手郝焕文、黑龙江铁道兵团农垦局八五六农场的模范拖拉机手靳德昌马上就贴出大字报，向他应战。郝焕文除在机耕、大修期等方面提出新的跃进指标以外，还保证耗油量按规定降低20％，修理费按规定降低50％。新疆生产建设兵团的模范汽车司机秦振中，也贴出了他向全国农场汽车司机提出的挑战书，他保证在安全行驶的条件下，用八个月时间完成1960年全年的行车任务。
    地质、水电、林业、水产、民航、测绘、气象、文教卫生、科学技术、民政、职工家属等系统的代表，今天也都继续开会交流经验或进行其他活动。商业系统的代表经过两天集中发言后，今天分成了十二个专业小组和四个综合组举行会议。粮食系统各专业组今天开始转入专题座谈。
