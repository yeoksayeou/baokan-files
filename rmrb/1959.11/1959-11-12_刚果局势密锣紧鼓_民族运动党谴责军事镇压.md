The situation in the Congo is rapidly intensifying. The Congolese people's struggle against the Belgian colonial authorities continues to unfold. According to Belgian news agencies on the 5th, following the people's struggle against colonial rule in Stanleyville, the situation in Yangambi, a city fifty miles from Stanleyville, is also becoming "increasingly tense." Many other cities have also seen outbreaks of struggles against colonial rule.

The Belgian colonial authorities have dispatched reinforcements to suppress the people's anti-colonial struggle in Yangambi.

On the 9th, the Congolese National Movement Party sent telegrams to Belgian King Baudouin and Belgian political leaders, accusing the colonial authorities of the Belgian Congo of being responsible for the recent bloody suppression in Stanleyville. The telegram pointed out that the disturbances in Stanleyville were caused by the provocative action of the colonial authorities sending police to fire on the Congolese people.

In a telegram to the Belgian Minister for Congolese and Ruanda-Urundi Affairs, the Congolese National Movement Party stated that if the Belgian authorities do not release the arrested leaders of the party, the party will refuse to negotiate with the Belgian government on the Congo issue.

    刚果局势密锣紧鼓
    民族运动党谴责军事镇压
    本报讯　刚果人民反对比利时殖民当局的斗争继续开展中。据比利时的通讯社5日透露，继斯坦利维尔人民举行反对殖民统治斗争后，离这个城市五十英里的扬干比城的形势也“愈来愈紧张”。其他许多城市也纷纷爆发反对殖民统治的斗争。
    比利时殖民当局已经调派增援部队镇压扬干比城人民的反殖民统治的斗争。
    刚果民族运动党9日打电报给比利时国王博杜安和比利时政界领袖，指责比属刚果殖民当局应对最近在斯坦利维尔的血腥镇压事件负责。电报指出，这次在斯坦利维尔的骚动是由于殖民当局派警察向刚果人民开火这一挑衅行动造成的。
    刚果民族运动党在给比利时刚果和卢安达—乌隆迪事务大臣的电报中说，假如比利时当局不释放这个党的被捕领袖，这个党就拒绝同比利时政府进行关于刚果问题的谈判。
