    Ten Outstanding Pig-Raising Girls
    Dai Xing, Cheng Xiang
    In the Lianyuan Livestock Farm of Toutuo Commune in Huangyan County, Zhejiang, there are ten outstanding pig-raising girls. Their names are Xu Heying, Cai Hualan, Gu Guixiang, Fan Julan, Wang Laogui, Huang Caiqin, Ge Caiqin, Bao Xiaojuan, Yang Chunlan, and Wang Xiaohe. Over the past year, they have learned a full set of techniques, including feeding, breeding, and disease prevention. Currently, they each raise an average of fifteen sows, twenty-five piglets, and fifty meat pigs, and they raise both large and small pigs very well.
            
    Loving the Pig-Raising事业
    After communization, the Lianyuan Agricultural Cooperative was reorganized into the Lianyuan Livestock Farm, and the "Ten Girls" were transferred from construction sites such as steel mills and briquette factories to the farm as feeders. At that time, the farm had not yet been built, and there was no clue about feeding management. Most of the hundred or so pigs that had just been bought were growing very poorly. For them, this was truly "like a new barber shop encountering a full beard," with many difficulties. At that time, some girls thought: this pig-raising job is smelly and dirty, and plus they are all "bony pigs", how can they be raised well? Under the education and help of the Party branch, the "Ten Girls" bravely accepted the task of raising sows. The eldest sister, Xu Heying, took the lead in holding the pigs in her arms, washing and scrubbing the pigs' mange with soapy water mixed with sulfur and 666 powder; and feeding the pigs with salt and clam ash mixed in the feed. They also learned the feed saccharification method from the Chaoji Breeding Station, using fresh green feed cooked in soup and fermented to feed the pigs, making them eat with relish. After one or two months of careful cultivation, the sixty or so sows they raised changed from "angular unicorns" to chubby and oily.
        
    Liberate Thinking and Learn Technology
    After winning the first battle, their confidence soared. Shortly after the establishment of the farm, the Commune Party Committee requested the Lianyuan Livestock Farm to resolutely implement the policy of self-breeding and self-raising, and to breed a large number of piglets. At that time, the Lianyuan Livestock Farm had more than three hundred sows, but only five boars, which could not meet the needs of breeding. What to do? Adopt artificial insemination.
   
   "Will people laugh at us if we learn this method?" They all thought this way. When this news spread, some people with feudal ideas began to gossip: "This group of women is really shameless, even learning this kind of shameful thing." Could they really succumb to the satire and attacks of feudal ideas? No, they could not. After everyone's discussion, they realized that learning artificial insemination was not a vulgar thing, but a glorious task for developing the pig-raising industry in a faster, better, and more economical way. At this time, the Party branch organized them to study theory in the livestock technology night school and invited livestock technology cadres to give them specific guidance. The encouragement and support of the Party broke their shyness and greatly enhanced their confidence and determination to learn artificial insemination. In just one week, all ten girls learned the techniques of artificial semen collection and insemination. In more than a month, they used artificial insemination to breed all three hundred sows on the farm.
        
    Try Every Possible Means to Prevent and Cure Pig Diseases
    In March of this year, some of the more than one thousand pigs on the farm developed diseases such as red eyes and white diarrhea. Like other feeders, the "Ten Girls" were worried and lost their appetite and could not sleep well. Although they had learned methods to prevent and cure general diseases in the livestock technology night school, using these methods required purchasing a large number of medicines, and at this time the farm was short of funds. What to do? They asked the old feeders for advice and actively searched for and studied local prevention and treatment methods. Xu Heying and others listened to the opinions of the old feeder Wang Xiaohe and used *bo gu su cao* juice instead of boric acid water to wash the pigs' eyes, and used ramie stalk ash and rice stalk ash to treat white diarrhea, achieving very good results. Wang Laogui and others learned the experience of grinding red charcoal into fine powder and feeding it to the pigs to stop diarrhea, and with the help of the veterinarian, successfully tested the method of using large *ai* moxibustion and white arsenic embedded in the ear to treat asthma. Thanks to their hard work, they finally cured the pig diseases and saved more than a thousand yuan in medical expenses.
        
    Separating and Penning in Groups and Carrying Out Innovation
    In terms of feeding management, the "Ten Girls" learned the experience of "separating and penning in groups, and rationing feed in stages" from the breeding station. According to the different conditions of the pigs, they separately penned old sows, new sows, piglet groups, fattening pig groups, meat pig groups, boar groups, etc. At the same time, according to the growth and development of the pigs, they did a good job in the staged matching of refined and green feed. In order to raise piglets with multiple births well, Xu Heying also selected sows with good maternal instincts and sufficient milk to separately raise piglets with multiple births. At the beginning, the fostered piglets sometimes escaped back, so she adopted the method of sending them back at night; some sows were unwilling to foster them, so she sprayed yellow wine or kerosene on both the sows and the piglets at the same time, so that the smell was the same, and the parent pigs and foster pigs could not be distinguished. They also set up "piglet troughs" to specifically strengthen the feeding management of piglets. Therefore, the survival rate of the piglets they raised reached more than 98%, and the sow litter rate reached 7.9 piglets per litter, with the highest litter producing 18 piglets.
    
    In the campaign to vigorously promote silage feed, the captain Xu Heying discovered that pigs loved to eat rice straw, especially fresh and tender green rice straw, when bedding the pig pens. She thought to herself: Pigs love to eat fresh rice straw, so if clam ash calcium is added during silage to soften the fiber, wouldn't the pigs love to eat it even more? So she immediately made a suggestion to the Party branch. After research, the Party branch believed it was a good idea, and after successful testing, convened an on-site meeting and immediately promoted it. The entire farm ensiled half of the more than 100 mu of fresh and tender rice straw and dried and powdered the other half, increasing the pig feed by more than 200,000 jin. According to scientific analysis, the rice straw treated with clam ash alkalization is very rich in nutrients. In order to improve labor efficiency, they advocated hard work plus ingenuity and used their brains everywhere. Recently, they created a method of transporting materials using one ox pulling six grinding mills and aerial rope suspension troughs, which increased work efficiency by three and a half times. From then on, they got rid of the heavy physical labor in pig raising.

    十个出色的养猪姑娘
    戴星  呈祥
    在浙江黄岩县头陀公社联群畜牧场，有十个出色的养猪姑娘，她们的名字是徐荷英、蔡花兰、顾桂香、范菊莲、王老桂、黄采琴、葛彩芹、包小娟、杨春兰、王小荷。一年来，她们学会了饲养、配种、防疫等一套技术。目前，她们每人平均饲养着十五头母猪、二十五头小猪和五十头肉猪，大猪小猪都养得很好。
            热爱养猪事业
    公社化后，联群农业社改建为联群畜牧场，“十姑娘”也从钢铁厂、煤球厂等工地上调到场里当饲养员。那个时候，场还没有建好，饲养管理也没有个头绪，刚买来的百十来头猪大部分都长得很差。这对她们来说，真是“新开剃头店，碰着连鬓胡”，困难重重。当时有个别姑娘想：养猪这个工作又臭又脏，加上都是些“骨头猪”，怎么养得好呢？在党支部的教育和帮助下，“十姑娘”勇敢地接受了饲养母猪的任务。大姐徐荷英带头把猪抱在怀里，用肥皂水掺硫磺、六六六粉等洗擦猪的疥癣病；用食盐、蜊灰拌在饲料中喂猪。她们还向潮济配种站学习了饲料糖化法，用夹鲜青饲料烧熟掺汤发酵喂猪，使猪吃得津津有味。经过一、二个月的精心培养，她们所饲养的六十多只母猪就从“六角麒麟”变得胖油油的了。
        解放思想学习技术
    第一仗打胜了，她们的信心更高涨。建场不久，公社党委要求联群畜牧场坚决贯彻执行自繁自育的方针，大量繁殖小猪。当时，联群畜牧场有三百多头母猪，可是只有五头公猪，不能满足配种的需要。怎么办呢？采用人工授精的办法。
   “学习这个办法，人家不笑话吗？”她们的心里都这样想。当这个消息传出后，一些有封建思想的人就风言风语起来了：“这班妇女真不要脸，连这种见不得人的事情都要学。”难道真的能在封建思想的讽刺打击面前屈服吗？不，不能。经过大家讨论，认识到学习人工授精不是下流事，而是为了多快好省地发展养猪事业，是一个光荣的任务。这时，党支部又组织她们进畜牧技术夜校学习理论，请畜牧技术干部对她们进行具体指导。党的鼓励和支持，使她们打破了怕羞的心理，大大增强了学习人工授精的信心和决心。只一个星期，十个姑娘全部学会了人工取精、授精的技术。一个多月内，她们用人工授精的方法，将全场三百多头母猪全部配上了种。
        千方百计防治猪疫
    今年3月间，全场一千多只猪中，有部分生了红眼、白痢等病，“十姑娘”也和其他饲养员一样，担心得吃饭无味、睡觉不安。她们虽然在畜牧技术夜校里学到了防治一般疾病的办法，但用这些方法需要购买大量药品，而这时场里又恰恰缺乏资金。怎么办？她们向老饲养员问计，积极寻找和研究土的防治方法。徐荷英等听了老饲养员汪小荷的意见，用鹁鸪酸草汁代替硼酸水洗猪眼，用苎麻秆灰、稻秆灰治白痢病，取得很好效果。王老桂等学习了用红炭捣细喂猪止泻的经验，又在兽医帮助下，试验成功用大艾烧灸和白砒嵌耳治气喘病的办法。在她们辛勤努力下，终于治好了猪病，还节约了医药费千余元。
        分群关养大搞革新
    在饲养管理方面，“十姑娘”学习了配种站的“分群关养、分期配料”的经验，根据猪只不同情况，把老母猪群、新母猪群、仔猪群、肥猪群、肉猪群、公猪群等分别关养，同时根据猪只生长发育情况，做好精青饲料的分期搭配。为了养好一胎多产的小猪，徐荷英还挑选母性好、奶水足的母猪分开带养一胎多产的小猪。开始时，寄养的小猪有时要逃回来，她就采取夜里送；有的母猪不愿带养，她就在母猪和小猪身上，同时喷上黄酒或煤油，使气味一样，分不开亲猪和义猪。她们还办了“小猪食槽”，专门加强了对小猪的饲养管理。因此，她们饲养的小猪成活率达到98％以上，母猪产仔率达到每窝七点九只，最高的一胎生出十八只小猪。
    在大搞青贮饲料运动中，队长徐荷英在给猪垫栏中，发现猪很爱吃稻草，特别是新鲜青嫩的稻草，猪吃得更是津津有味。她心里想：鲜稻草猪爱吃，如果青贮时加上蜊灰钙，使纤维变软，猪不是更爱吃吗？于是她立即向党支部提出建议，党支部研究后认为是个好办法，经过试验成功，召开现场会议，立即推广。全场将一百多亩青嫩稻草一半青贮，一半晒干打粉，增加了猪的饲料二十多万斤。经过蜊灰碱化处理后的稻草，根据科学分析，养分很丰富。为了提高劳动效率，她们提倡苦干加巧干，处处动脑筋。最近她们创造了一牛拉六磨和空中绳索吊槽的运料法，提高工效三倍半，从此她们摆脱了养猪工作当中繁重的体力劳动。
