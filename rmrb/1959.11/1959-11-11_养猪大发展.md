    Great Development of Pig Raising
    Yuan Shuipai, Shi Hua Junwu, Painting
	Mu (a unit of area) is like dots, horizontals, and fields. Fat pigs are the dots, pigpens are the horizontals, and the fields are green. With one pig planned per mu, there will be fertile land and pig manure. Raise more pigs in accordance with local conditions, and actively respond to the Party's call.

    养猪大发展
    袁水拍　诗华君武　画亩字点、横、田，肥猪是一点，猪圈儿是横，田里绿成片。一亩一头计划好，肥田还有猪粪尿，因地制宜多养猪，积极响应党号召。
