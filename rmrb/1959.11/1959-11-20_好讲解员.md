    Good Guide
    Recently, at the "Ten Years of National Work Exhibition" held at the National Cultural Palace, guides from different ethnic groups were assigned to explain the sections related to their own ethnicities. Some were even from the exhibition areas themselves, such as the guide numbered 121 from the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, who was a member of the Nanping People's Commune. While he was explaining the life before and after liberation, expressions of pain and joy naturally appeared on his face. When he spoke of the 690,000 slaves in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture who had turned over under the leadership of the Party, his voice was so excited and moving that it conveyed a sense of joy from the heart. When talking about the increased production of the Nanping People's Commune and the construction of many new factories and primary schools, the deep love and pride for his hometown were so apparent that every audience member was deeply moved and received a vivid education.
    Of course, this method of arranging and training guides may not be possible for every exhibition, but this kind of concise, clear, skilled, and emotionally rich explanation can greatly enhance the effect of the exhibition.

    好讲解员
    最近在民族文化宫举办的“十年民族工作展览”会上，由不同民族的讲解员来担任自己民族部分的讲解，有的就是展出地区的人，如凉山彝族自治州第一百二十一号讲解员，他就是南坪人民公社的社员。他讲解解放前后的生活在他脸部上自然出现痛苦和欢乐的表情，当他讲到凉山彝族自治州六十九万奴隶在党的领导下翻身的时候，声音是那么激动感人，使人感到一种来自内心的喜悦。讲到南坪人民公社生产增长了，新建许多工厂、小学校时，那股出于对自己家乡的深厚的热爱和自豪心情的流露，使每一个观众都很感动，受到了一次生动的教育。
    当然，这种安排和训练讲解员的方法，不一定能安排到每一次展览会中，但这种简明、清楚、熟练而且具有丰富情感的讲解，可以使展览的效果大为加强。
