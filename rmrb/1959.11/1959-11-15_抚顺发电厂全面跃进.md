Fushun Power Plant Achieves Comprehensive Leap Forward

Under the leadership of the Party, all employees of the Fushun Power Plant, holding high the red flag of the General Line, generated 2,007,860,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity from January to September this year, completing 77.8% of the annual plan, a 36% increase compared to the same period last year. The plant has also excellently fulfilled the state plan in terms of the amount of low-quality coal burned, plant power consumption rate, unit cost, and total cost.

Continuously Opposing Rightism, Exploring Equipment Potential

Continuously opposing rightism and increasing power generation by improving equipment output on the basis of safety is an important measure for the continuous leap forward of the Fushun Power Plant. When the Fushun Power Plant proposed measures to explore equipment potential and increase equipment output, some cadres in the plant said, "Increasing equipment output can easily lead to problems; it's okay in winter, but not in summer." In response to this situation, the plant launched an in-depth discussion on seizing every second and competing for every kilowatt-hour. During the discussion, the masses put forward a total of 172 measures, breaking the various concerns of those with right-leaning thoughts. They used a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to install water pool nozzles, enlarge water pump impellers, add transformer cooling equipment, install turbine load flushing devices, and improve the ventilation facilities of generators and motors. As a result, they maintained operation at 315,000 kilowatts per hour during the hottest weather in July and August, increasing output by about 28,000 kilowatts. From January to September this year, the plant's equipment utilization hours reached 6,960 hours, 634 hours more than the same period last year, equivalent to 26 days of overproduction. The electricity generated by exploring equipment potential alone amounted to 213,920,000 kilowatt-hours, equivalent to the total power generation of the Fushun Dahuo房 Hydropower Station in nine months, enough to supply lighting for six Fushun cities.

When promoting the burning of low-quality coal at the Fushun Power Plant, some also believed that it was absolutely impossible to both increase output and burn coarse grains (low-quality coal). The plant adopted a method combining cadres and workers, formulating measures and conducting experiments to break down right-leaning thoughts. As a result, not only did the proportion of low-quality coal burned increase, but also the boiler combustion situation stabilized. From January to the end of September, the plant burned a total of 344,677 tons of low-quality coal.

Ensuring Safety, Generating More Electricity and Using Less

In order to ensure safe production, the Fushun Power Plant launched a massive, large-scale mass safety production inspection campaign at the beginning of this year, centered on checking thoughts, systems, and equipment defects. After this inspection, the majority of employees paid more attention to safe production, and started from aspects such as shift handover, on-site discipline, implementation of regulations, and safety activities, to formulate mass safety covenants. The plant put forward the slogan "Small defects will not last overnight, large defects will not last a day," and promptly discovered and eliminated more than 40,000 equipment defects, avoiding many accidents. Especially in lightning protection work, due to vigorous seasonal accident prevention and lightning protection work, no problems occurred during the more than 30 thunderstorms and seven system failures in July and August this year. In terms of equipment maintenance, they adopted a combination of normal planned maintenance and holiday and vacation blitzes to vigorously carry out equipment maintenance work, so that the plant's equipment accidents decreased by 33% compared to the same period last year.

Strengthening Leadership, Continuously Improving Management Level

All major issues and central tasks of the Fushun Power Plant are discussed at the weekly Party Committee Standing Committee meetings or the bi-monthly Party Committee meetings. They resolutely implemented the plant director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party Committee and the employee representative conference system. In order to adapt to the situation of mass movements, effectively handle and command daily production issues, the administration established systems such as telephone reporting and execution plan inspection. The work and major tasks of each quarter are submitted to the employee representative conference for full discussion. In the process of participating in labor, cadres also worked with the masses, using the "three-in-one" method, in the spirit of being both active and serious, to revise and improve 139 technical regulations and administrative management systems, further promoting the development of production.

### 抚顺发电厂全面跃进

    抚顺发电厂全面跃进
    抚顺发电厂全体职工在党的领导下，高举总路线的红旗，在今年1至9月份已发电二十亿零七百八十六万度，完成了全年计划的77.8％，比去年同期增长36％。在烧用劣质煤数量、厂用电率、单位成本、总成本方面，也都出色地完成了国家计划。
    不断反右倾，挖掘设备潜力
    不断反对右倾，在安全的基础上，提高设备出力多发电，是抚顺发电厂不断跃进的一个重要措施。抚顺电厂提出挖掘设备潜力，提高设备出力的跃进措施时，厂里部分干部说：“提高设备出力容易出乱子；冬季还可以，但夏季就不行了”。针对这种情况，厂里深入开展了分秒必争，度电必争的讨论。在讨论中，群众共提出一百七十二项措施，打破了有右倾思想的人的种种顾虑。他们以土洋结合的方法，加装了水池喷嘴，改大了水泵叶轮，增设了变压器冷却设备，安装了汽轮机带负荷冲洗装置，改进了发电机和马达的通风设施，因而，在7、8月最炎热的天气，仍然保持每小时三十一万五千瓩运行，提高出力二万八千瓩左右。今年1至9月份，这个厂的设备利用小时已达六千九百六十小时，比去年同期多六百三十四小时，相当于超产二十六天。仅通过挖掘设备潜力给国家多发的电量就有二亿一千三百九十二万度，相当于抚顺大伙房水电站九个月的发电量的总和，可供六个抚顺市的照明用电。
    抚顺电厂在推行烧劣质煤的时候，也有人认为：既要提高出力多发电，又要吃粗粮（劣煤），是绝对办不到的事。厂里就采取干部和工人相结合，拟措施，搞试验的办法来打破右倾思想，结果不仅烧劣煤的比例提高了，而且锅炉燃烧情况稳定。这个厂从1月到9月底，共烧劣煤三十四万四千六百七十七吨。
    确保安全，多发电少用电
    为了保证安全生产，抚顺发电厂今年一开始就开展了声势浩大、规模壮阔的以检查思想、制度、设备缺陷为中心的群众性的安全生产大检查运动。经过这一检查，引起了广大职工对安全生产的重视，并从交接班、现场纪律、执行规程、安全活动等方面入手，制订了群众性的安全公约。厂里提出了“小缺陷不过夜，大缺陷不过天”的口号，及时发现与消除了设备缺陷四万多件，避免了多次事故的发生。特别是在防雷工作上，由于大搞季节性事故预防和防雷工作，今年7、8两月经受三十多次巨雷和七次系统故障，都没有发生问题。在设备维修方面，他们采取正常计划检修与节日、假日突击相结合的办法，大力开展设备维修工作，使全厂设备事故比去年同期减少33％。
    加强领导，不断提高管理水平
    抚顺发电厂的一切重大问题和每个时期的中心工作，都是经过每周一次的党委常委会或每月两次的党委会讨论的。他们坚决贯彻执行了党委领导下的厂长负责制和职工代表大会制度。行政上为了适应群众运动的形势，有效地处理和指挥日常生产问题，建立了电话汇报、执行计划检查等制度，每个季度的工作和重大任务，都提交职工代表大会充分讨论。干部在参加劳动的过程中，还和群众一起，用“三结合”的办法，本着既积极又严肃的精神，修编与健全了一百三十九种技术规程与行政管理制度，进一步推动了生产的发展。
