Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 21st. As of the 16th, Henan Province had collected 186,970,000 jin of various wild plant materials, with a total value of 39,090,000 yuan. Commercial departments purchased an average of 4 million jin per day, more than three times higher than in October. All parts of Henan Province have attached great importance to processing work in the "Small Autumn Harvest". In the Nanyang Special District, eight counties including Neixiang, Xixia, and Xichuan have established 3,805 processing factories, processing 9,530,000 jin of miscellaneous oils, wild fibers, starch, chemical raw materials, and medicinal materials, as well as 593,000 pieces of water conservancy construction tools such as carrying baskets and wicker baskets.

In order to make full use of wild plant resources, many places have made efforts to advance collection and processing simultaneously. At the beginning of the campaign, the commercial department of Lushan County extracted 65 technicians to run demonstration processing factories, using 14 kinds of wild starch materials such as acorns to brew more than 50,000 jin of liquor, using wild fibers to make 150,000 jin of earthen paper, using 180 kinds of wild poisonous weeds to process 320,000 jin of pesticides, and using wild oil materials to process 12,000 jin of miscellaneous oils. Neixiang County put forward the slogan "Make wild plant materials light to carry down the mountain" and moved 156 processing factories to the mountains for on-site processing. In October, Mashan Commune in this county collected 5 million jin of various mountain products. After processing and selling based on the original value of 2.8 million yuan, the net income reached 5 million yuan. The commune used this money to buy two seeders, 17 rubber-wheeled carts, six diesel engines and locomotive boilers, 600,000 jin of chemical fertilizers, 1.5 million jin of pesticides, and allocated more than 50,000 yuan as funds for water conservancy construction.

During the "Small Autumn Harvest" campaign, the Henan Provincial Science and Technology Commission and the Henan Provincial Department of Commerce jointly organized an exploration team to survey resources in the mountains. The commercial departments went up the mountains to supply collectors with a large number of kerosene lamps, gas lamps, bamboo pole lamps, table salt and various tools, and set up mobile sample exhibition halls in the mountains to guide collection.

At present, the "Small Autumn Harvest" activities are still actively underway in various places. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires the province to closely combine water conservancy construction and agricultural production, make a concentrated effort for half a month, and complete and over fulfill this year's wild plant collection and purchase plan before the ice and snow seal the ground.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 21st. Sichuan is strengthening the collection, purchase, and processing of wild plants. As of November 5, the province's commercial departments had purchased more than 2,120,000 dan of wild fibers, starch, oil materials, and tannin extracts, and had successively processed them into more than 200 kinds of products such as earthen paper, artificial cotton, wine, candy, oils, grass mats, and prepared medicines, which were transported to various places inside and outside the province.

Since the start of the "Small Autumn Harvest" in Sichuan Province, the quantity and variety of wild plants on the market have been continuously increasing. In order to do a good job in processing and production in a timely manner, various places have adopted a combination of centralization and decentralization, and a "two-legged approach" combining commercial departments and mass processing to speed up processing progress. Zhong County has the commercial departments independently operate or jointly operate factories with the communes to produce varieties that require certain processing equipment and complex processing technology; for varieties that are easy to process, management districts and production teams are organized to run factories for processing. In this way, 2,097 factories for brewing, tannin extract, paper making, prepared medicines, non-staple foods, starch, and fiber processing were quickly set up in the county. Within a short period of time, the total value of wild plant processed products such as artificial cotton, ropes, wine, earthen paper, and tannin extracts reached more than 1.2 million yuan.

The processing factories run by commercial departments, communes, and management districts actively carried out technological innovation, expanded varieties, and improved quality when processing wild plants. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the wild fiber factory in Jiajiang County reformed more than 20 kinds of processing tools, basically realizing the semi-mechanization of degumming, hammering, and weaving processes. Now, the products manufactured by this factory using wild fibers have developed from a single artificial cotton to spinning, weaving, and manufacturing blankets. These products are well received by the masses due to their good quality and low price.

While accelerating the processing and production of wild plants, the commercial departments in various places also seized the opportunity to supply industrial cities with wild plant raw materials. In the past month or so, the province has successively transferred 300,000 dan of wild plants to supply paper, textile, and chemical departments in Chongqing, Chengdu, Shanghai, Tianjin, Zhejiang and other places.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st. Qinyuan County, Shanxi Province, mobilized the masses to adopt various methods to vigorously store and process wild plants. In the past month, the county's ten communes have established 66 wild plant processing factories, producing 93 kinds of daily necessities and non-staple foods, increasing pig feed by 2,180,000 jin, and increasing pig raising by 3,813 heads, which has powerfully promoted the development of agriculture and commune industry.

While carrying out autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and autumn sowing, the people's communes in Qinyuan County successively organized more than 53,000 people to collect 3,872,200 jin of various wild plants. Among them were 2,734,800 jin of 36 kinds of fruits such as acorns, water pears, buckthorns, and mountain haws; 30,000 jin of medicinal materials such as codonopsis, poria cocos, rhubarb, and fritillaria; as well as mountain delicacies and wild flavors such as wood ear, mushrooms, monkey head, and Zucai, and various forages and tree barks. In addition to directly supplying the state and supporting the market, these treasures from the mountains still have a surplus of 3,292,000 jin. After the end of the "Small Autumn Harvest," the Qinyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly instructed the communes to take the following measures to store and process wild plants: (1) Adopt self-reliance methods to establish a batch of wild plant processing industries for rapid processing; (2) Achieve multiple uses for one thing, comprehensively utilize, and improve the utilization value of wild plants; (3) Store a large amount of wild feed to increase the source of pig feed. Guodao People's Commune conscientiously implemented the call of the county party committee, mobilized commune members to use several methods such as fermentation, silage, cutting and drying, crushing, and distillation to store wild plants, and simply set up 19 wild plant processing factories, brewing 16 kinds of fine wines such as bamboo leaf green, Maru Hong, and Zhuangyuan Hong from 32 kinds of mountain fruits, and making 40 kinds of "grain-free pastries." In order to comprehensively utilize wild resources, this commune also processed the raw materials remaining after brewing wine into vinegar and starch; used weeds to process paper, and blended wild fibers with hemp and wool to weave more than 100 blankets. At present, these products have been continuously supplied to the market.

The Qinyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an on-site meeting in Guodao Commune to promote the experience of this commune. The other people's communes in the county raised funds and equipment by themselves, and built more than 40 small processing factories for mountain fruit brewing, grain-free pastries, fiber, paper making, and medicinal materials in less than a month, opening up more than ten production avenues such as vinegar making, wine making, pastries, paper, fiber, and feed.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 21st. Jianhe County, Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, has launched a mass mountain product processing activity.

As of November 8, the county has established more than 3,900 various processing factories for starch, tannin extract, oil pressing, and earthen alkali, and established 10,000 shock processing groups. It has produced more than 600,000 jin of tannin extract, more than 9,700,000 jin of starch, more than 280,000 jin of white wine, and more than 1,200,000 jin of oils, earthen alkali, and fire saltpeter.

Under the leadership of the Jianhe County Committee of the Communist Party of China, people of all ethnic groups organized more than 80,000 people to go up the mountains to collect treasures in mid-October. After more than 20 days of hard work, a total of more than 54 million jin of various mountain products such as quercus dentata, tung seeds, tea seeds, five-倍子, and medicinal materials were collected, with a value of more than 14 million yuan. Calculated by the county's population, the average income can be increased by 61.5 yuan per person. In order to make full use of the collected mountain products, the county party committee called on commune members and cadres to learn if they don't understand, learn while doing, start with everyone, and vigorously engage in mountain product processing. At the same time, it also organized the masses to carry out special discussion of "Why should we engage in processing vigorously?" to improve the understanding of commune members, establish confidence, and the whole county learned technology and all teams engaged in processing.

The fact that mountain product processing in Jianhe County can quickly form a mass movement is mainly due to the conscientious implementation of the principle of relying mainly on indigenous production methods, and combining indigenous and foreign production methods. Refining tannin extract originally required very complicated equipment, but local people could produce it with only a basin and an earthen pot. The method is simple, everyone can learn it, and it can be done everywhere. The communes also adopted a method combining professional teams and all-people shock efforts to quickly popularize processing activities. In addition to the professional teams, other commune members in Gedong Commune also engaged in mountain product processing during agricultural production breaks. Due to the high enthusiasm and creativity of the commune members of all ethnic groups, the processed products of mountain products in the county are not only large in quantity and good in quality, but also achieve comprehensive utilization. Taking Quercus dentata as an example, the commune members use it to make starch, brew fine wine, and process it into nearly ten kinds of non-staple foods such as candies, biscuits, vermicelli, and tofu.

In order to improve processing efficiency, all people's commune processing factories paid attention to technological innovation. Wu Yuanlun, a worker in the Taigong Commune Food Processing Factory, created a Quercus dentata sheller, which can shell 3,000 jin per person per day, increasing work efficiency tenfold. At present, the people of the whole county are working hard, determined to process all kinds of mountain products that need to be processed completely this month. (Attached pictures)

    河南四川山西贵州等地巩固和扩大“小秋收”成果
    建立大批野生植物加工厂
    新华社郑州21日电　截至16日统计，河南省已采集各种野生植物原料一万八千六百九十七万斤，总值三千九百零九万元；商业部门平均每日收购四百万斤，比10月份上升三倍多。河南省各地在“小秋收”中十分重视加工工作。南阳专区内乡、西峡、淅川等八个县，已建立加工厂三千八百零五个，加工杂油、野生纤维、淀粉、化工原料、药材等九百五十三万斤，抬筐、荆篮等水利建设工具五十九万三千件。
    为了充分利用野生植物资源，许多地方做到采集和加工齐头并进。鲁山县商业部门在运动开始就抽出六十五名技术人员，举办示范性的加工厂，利用橡籽等十四种野生淀粉原料酿酒五万多斤，用野生纤维制造土纸十五万斤、野生毒草一百八十种加工农药三十二万斤、野生油料加工杂油一万二千斤。内乡县提出“使野生植物原料轻装下山”的口号，把一百五十六个加工厂搬到山上，就地加工。这个县的马山公社10月份采集各种山货五百万斤，在原来价值二百八十万元的基础上，经加工后出售，纯收入达五百万元。公社用这些钱买了两部播种机，十七部胶轮车，六部柴油机和锅驼机，化肥六十万斤，农药一百五十万斤，并拨出五万多元作为水利建设的资金。
    在“小秋收”运动中，河南省科学技术委员会和河南省商业厅联合组织了勘查队，上山勘查资源。商业部门上山给采集人员供应了大批马灯，汽灯，竹竿灯，食盐以及各种工具，在山上设立流动样品展览馆，指导采集。
    目前，各地“小秋收”活动还在积极进行。中共河南省委要求全省紧密结合水利建设和农业生产，突击半个月，在冰雪封冻之前，完成和超额完成今年的野生植物采集和收购计划。
    新华社成都21日电　四川各地加强野生植物的采集、收购和加工工作，到11月5日，全省商业部门已经收购野生纤维、淀粉、油料、栲胶共二百一十二万多担，并已陆续加工制成土纸、人造棉、酒、糖果、油脂、草席、成药等二百多种产品，运往省内外各地。
    四川省开始“小秋收”以来，各地上市的野生植物数量、品种都不断上升。为了及时做好加工生产，各地采取了集中与分散相结合，商业部门与群众性加工相结合“两条腿走路”的办法加快加工进度。忠县把需要一定加工设备、加工技术较复杂的品种由商业部门自办或同公社合办厂坊生产；容易加工的品种，组织管理区和生产队办厂加工。这样，迅速在全县办起酿酒、栲胶、造纸、成药、副食品、淀粉、纤维加工等厂坊二千零九十七个。短期内生产出人造棉、绳索、酒、土纸、栲胶等野生植物加工品总值达一百二十多万元。
    各商业部门、公社、管理区办的加工厂在加工野生植物时，积极开展技术革新，扩大花色品种，提高质量。夹江县野生纤维厂在党委领导下，改革了二十多种加工工具，使脱胶、锤打、纺织等工序基本上实现了半机械化。现在这个厂利用野生纤维制造的产品，已从单一的人造棉，发展到纺纱、织布和制造毯子，这些产品由于质量良好，价值低廉，深受群众欢迎。
    在加速野生植物的加工生产的同时，各地商业部门还抓紧给工业城市供应野生植物原料。最近一个多月来，全省已先后调出三十万担野生植物，供应重庆、成都、上海、天津、浙江等地的造纸、纺织和化工部门。
    新华社太原21日电　山西沁源县发动群众采取多种多样办法大搞野生植物的贮存和加工。全县十个公社在最近一个月中，兴办起六十六个野生植物加工厂，生产出九十三种日用品和副食品，增加猪饲料二百一十八万斤，增养猪三千八百一十三头，有力地促进了农业和公社工业的发展。
    沁源县各人民公社在秋收、秋种、秋播的同时，先后组织了五万三千多人，采回各种野生植物三百八十七万二千多斤。其中有橡子、水梨、圪尖、山定子等三十六种果品二百七十三万四千八百斤；党参、猪苓、大黄、贝母等药材三万斤；还有木耳、菇、猴头、足菜等山珍野味和各种草料、树皮。这些山中百宝除直接供应国家和支援市场外；尚余三百二十九万二千斤。中共沁源县委在“小秋收”结束以后及时指示各公社采取以下措施贮存和加工野生植物：（一）采取自力更生办法兴办一批野生植物加工工业，迅速加工；（二）作到一物多用，综合利用，提高野生植物的利用价值；（三）贮备大量野生饲料，增加猪饲料来源。郭道人民公社认真贯彻执行了县委号召，发动社员用发酵、青贮、切晒、粉碎、蒸馏等几种方法贮存野生植物，因陋就简地办起了十九个野生植物加工厂，把三十二种山果酿造出竹叶青、马如红、状元红等十六种美酒，制出四十种“无粮糕点”。为了综合利用野生资源，这个公社还把酿酒剩下的原料又加工成醋和淀粉；用杂草加工成纸张，用野生纤维和麻、毛混纺，织成一百多块绒毯。目前这些产品已经源源供应市场。
    中共沁源县县委最近在郭道公社召开现场会议推广了这个公社的经验，全县其他几个人民公社自筹资金，自筹设备，不到一个月就建起山果酿造、无粮糕点、纤维、造纸、药材等小型加工厂四十多个，开辟了制醋、制酒、糕点、纸张、纤维、饲料等十多种生产门路。
    新华社贵阳21日电　黔东南苗族侗族自治州剑河县展开了群众性的山货加工活动。
    到11月8日，全县已办淀粉、栲胶、油榨、土碱等各种加工厂三千九百多个，建立突击加工组一万个。已生产栲胶六十多万斤，淀粉九百七十多万斤，白酒二十八万多斤，以及油脂、土碱、火硝等一百二十多万斤。
    在中共剑河县委的领导下，各族人民在10月中旬就组织了八万多人上山采宝。经二十多天奋战，共采摘青杠子、桐子、茶子、五棓子、药材等各种山货五万四千多万斤，价值一千四百多万元；按全县人口计算，每人平均可增加收入六十一元五角。为了把采集的各种山货充分利用起来，县委号召社员和干部们不懂就学，边学边干，全民动手，大搞山货加工；同时，还组织群众开展了“为什么要大搞加工”的专题鸣放辩论，提高了社员的认识，树立了信心，全县人人学技术，队队搞加工。
    剑河县山货加工能很快形成群众性运动，主要是认真贯彻执行了土法生产为主、土法和洋法生产结合的方针。炼栲胶本来需要很复杂的设备，可是当地群众只用一个盆子和一个瓦罐，就能生产，办法简单，人人可学，处处能办。各公社还采取专业队同全民突击相结合的办法，使加工活动很快普及。革东公社除专业队外，其他社员在农业生产间隙也都搞山货加工。由于各族社员发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，全县山货的加工成品不但量多质好，而且做到了综合利用。以青杠子为例，社员们用它制成淀粉，酿造美酒，加工成糖果、饼干、粉条、豆腐等副食品近十来种。
    为了提高加工效率，各人民公社加工厂都注意了技术革新。台拱公社食品加工厂工人吴远伦，创造了青杠子脱壳机，一人一天可脱壳三千斤，提高工效十倍。目前，全县人民正大干特干，决心在本月内把所有需要加工的各种山货全部加工完毕。（附图片）
