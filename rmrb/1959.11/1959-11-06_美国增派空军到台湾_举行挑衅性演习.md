Xinhua News Agency, November 5th, Taipei Dispatch: A mobile strike force of the U.S. Pacific Air Forces has recently been transferred to Taiwan, and began a ten-day provocative exercise on the 3rd of this month. According to the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force Command in Manila, which commands this force, the U.S. Air Force detachment flew to Taiwan for exercises to test its ability to "rapidly attack." The exercise will involve "air attacks and reconnaissance flights" against so-called "hypothetical enemies." Dean, commander of the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force's forward command in Taiwan, also clamored that this exercise provides an "active deterrent force" for the United States in the Taiwan area. Prior to this air force exercise, the U.S. Navy, together with the navies of the Philippines and Chiang Kai-shek, held a four-day so-called "joint mine-sweeping and mine-laying exercise" in the waters south of Taiwan. The United States also handed over six small landing craft to Chiang Kai-shek's navy in late October.
