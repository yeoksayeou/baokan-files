This newspaper reports from Taiyuan on the 24th: The sheep-raising industry in the Jinbei area of Shanxi Province has experienced unprecedented development this year. According to statistics, the total number of sheep in the entire area has reached more than 2,790,000. From January to October this year, the number increased by 27% compared to the entire year of last year, exceeding the average net increase rate of the past nine years by more than two times. Counties such as Wuzhai, Lingqiu, Hequ, and Xingxian have particularly prominent growth rates, reaching 36% to 42%.

The achievement of such high-speed development of sheep flocks is historically rare in Shanxi Province. The Jinbei area has vast land, abundant water, and lush grass, providing extremely favorable conditions for developing animal husbandry. However, in recent years, the development of animal husbandry has been relatively slow. After the establishment of people's communes, the development of collective feeding promoted the high-speed growth of sheep. Currently, collective feeding accounts for over 90% of the 2,790,000 sheep in the area. People's communes in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas throughout the region have generally established commune-level sheep flocks, and comprehensive ranches have been established in plain areas. With the development of commune-level sheep flocks and ranches, they have played a significant role in assisting backward management areas and improving management techniques. In particular, it has greatly promoted the improvement of fine-wool sheep. This year, the number of improved fine-wool sheep in the area reached 600,000, and the number improved in one year exceeded more than half of the total number improved in the previous nine years. Communes throughout the region have unified planning and arrangements, providing many new conditions, both materially and technically, for the development of sheep flocks. Through reasonable planning and utilization of land by the communes, forage grass bases have been generally established. This year, the area of perennial and annual forage grass land in the area has increased to 1.8 million mu, more than double that of last year. The large-scale development of pasture grass has guaranteed the source of feed. Communes in various regions have promoted new technologies and experiences in breeding sheep flocks, greatly accelerating the breeding speed. This year, in Wuzhai County alone, more than 20,000 ewes have developed from producing one lamb per year to producing twins per year or one lamb twice a year. In the Nanjiangou Management Area of the Gudatun Commune in Yanggao County, ewes that produced twin lambs or had twin pregnancies accounted for 92% of the total number of ewes. Therefore, the number of lambs increased by one time this year. Communes throughout the region have established and improved epidemic prevention and veterinary organizations, and have generally promoted management systems such as assigning herders, determining the number of sheep, setting quotas for manure accumulation, setting quotas for lamb production, and guaranteeing survival, lamb production, wool production, and breed improvement. This has greatly improved the reproduction rate, and this year the spread of sheep pox disease has been basically controlled throughout the area.

So far, the entire region has sold more than 178,000 commodity sheep, overfulfilling the state's procurement task. Preliminary calculations show that the total income from sheep has reached more than 5 million yuan, and the production of sheepskin, wool, and other products has greatly exceeded any previous year. The absolute number of eliminated and slaughtered sheep has also increased accordingly, and the lives of the masses have greatly improved. Sheep raising has also played a significant role in increasing agricultural production. In the past, individual sheep raising was common, and sheep rarely left their pens. The vigorous development of collective feeding and the general implementation of sheep resting on the ground has, according to the summary materials of many regions, enabled each sheep to add 30 dan of fertilizer. Through the promotion of distant grazing and ground resting experience, the difficulties of transporting fertilizer in remote and mountainous areas have also been solved, saving a large amount of labor and animal power, and obtaining increased production.

    集体喂养管理好繁殖快
    晋北羊只增长27％
    本报太原24日电　山西省晋北地区今年养羊事业空前大发展，根据统计，全专区现有羊只已达到二百七十九万多只。今年1至10月比去年全年增长了27％，超过了最近九年平均纯增率的两倍多。五寨、灵丘、河曲、兴县等县，纯增率达到了36％到42％，发展速度尤为突出。
    羊群高速度发展的成就，在山西省是历史上罕有的。晋北地区土地广阔，水草丰富，发展畜牧事业有着极其有利的条件。但是，最近几年来，畜牧工作发展比较缓慢。人民公社化以后，由于集体饲养工作的发展，促进了羊只高速度增长。现在全区二百七十九万多只羊中，集体喂养比例占到了90％以上。全区山区半山区公社已普遍建立了公社羊群、平川区普遍建立了综合牧场。随着公社一级羊群、牧场的发展，在帮助落后管理区和改进管理技术等方面都起了重大作用。特别是对改良细毛羊工作起了很大促进作用。今年全区改良细毛羊达到了六十万只，一年改良的数量就达到了前九年改良总数的一半以上。各地公社统一规划、统一安排，从物质上技术上都为发展羊群提供了许多新条件。经过公社合理规划、利用土地，普遍建立了饲草基地。今年全区多年生和当年生饲草地发展到一百八十万亩，比去年增加了两倍。牧草大发展，保证了饲料来源。各地公社推广了繁殖羊群的新技术新经验，大大加快了繁殖速度。五寨县今年就有两万多只母羊，由一年一胎一羔发展到一年双胎或一胎双羔。阳高县谷大屯公社南井沟管理区产双羔、产双胎的母羊占到了母羊总数的92％，因此，今年羊羔增加了一倍。全区公社社社都建立健全了防疫、兽医组织，普遍推广了定牧工、定羊数、定积肥、定产羔和包成活、包产羔、包产毛、包改良等管理制度，大大提高了繁殖率，今年全区基本上控制了羊痘病的蔓延。
    到目前为止，全专区已出售商品羊十七万八千多只，超额完成了国家收购任务。初步计算羊的总收入已达五百多万元，羊皮羊毛等产品都大大超过了以往任何一年。当地淘汰宰杀绝对数量也相应增多，群众生活有了很大改善。养羊对农业增产也起了很大作用。过去个体养羊多，羊很少出圈。大兴集体饲养，普遍实行羊卧地的办法，根据许多地区的总结材料，一只羊可以增加三十担肥料。经过推广远处放牧和卧地经验，还解决了远地、山地运输肥料的困难，节省了大批劳畜力，获得了增产。
