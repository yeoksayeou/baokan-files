    Revolutionary Backbone
    Cheng Li
    The heroes attending the National Congress of Heroes have many characteristics worth learning from. One of these is their spirit of daring and doing, their revolutionary backbone.
    The heroes' backbone lies in their loyalty to the revolutionary cause, their strong will, unshaken by the wind and unburned by fire. They dare to set ambitious goals, establish great aspirations, and dare to think, speak, and act. In ordinary times, they work diligently and steadfastly. At first glance, they don't seem to have anything extraordinary, but when faced with difficulties, they step forward, boldly meet the challenges, and overcome them. Indeed, "difficult times reveal the hero," demonstrating their revolutionary backbone. When faced with adverse winds and currents, they can withstand them and advance against the tide, demonstrating their revolutionary backbone. In changing our country's "poor and blank" state, in changing the backwardness of enterprises or technologies, they demonstrate their revolutionary backbone.
    Consider Comrade Xu Xuehui from Yunnan. This eighteen-year-old girl dared to fight six vicious bandits armed with knives and guns with her bare hands. Even after being severely slashed in the mouth by a bandit, she continued to fight. Even after her hands were cut, she continued to fight. Finally, she protected the safety of state property. What a strong backbone! Even though she lost her hands and became disabled, she still overflows with high revolutionary optimism and does not regret her disability at all. Again, what a strong backbone!
    Then consider Xu Chenglong, a carpenter from Shandong. During the First Five-Year Plan, he created and improved 65 types of woodworking machines and tools. The saved man-hours are equivalent to 130 years of work for an ordinary worker. In 1958, he and his partners trial-produced and improved 34 machines, tools, and advanced experiences for promotion. In the spring of 1959, he created asbestos spinning machines, electric polishing machines, and other machines in asbestos textile technology, which he originally knew nothing about. Among them, the asbestos spinning machine increased efficiency by more than 130 times.
    The reason why the heroes' backbone is so strong lies in their loyalty to the Party and socialism. They are wholeheartedly loyal to the Party and the cause of the Party; they defend the cause of the Party, are bravely unyielding; and they fight difficulties with firmness and tenacity.
    However, in our revolutionary ranks, there are also some people who fall down when they encounter difficulties and surrender when they encounter evil. They are afraid of new things and nostalgic for old things; afraid of mass movements and like to be cold and quiet; afraid of making great strides forward and like to stand still or take small steps; afraid of more, faster, better, and more economical, and like less, slower, worse, and more expensive. Others, seeing a speck of dust the size of a grain of rice flying up behind the galloping Great Leap Forward, make a fuss, shouting "It's terrible, it's terrible," "It's a disaster, it's a disaster," "It's ruined, it's ruined"... They specifically discourage and throw cold water on the revolutionary backbone, singing a contrary tune. They wantonly attack the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, the People's Communes, the Great Steel Smelting, and so on. Among these people, some are ideologically confused, while others have a "rebellious bone" that is incompatible with the socialist cause!
    Our country is a large country that is "poor and blank." To completely change this "poor and blank" face, everyone must have a revolutionary backbone. On the road to changing this "poor and blank" state, there are still various difficulties and evil forces that we need to overcome and defeat. This also requires everyone to have a revolutionary backbone. And those patients with "soft bone disease" should undergo surgery to remove the "soft bone" or "rebellious bone" and replace it with a revolutionary backbone!

    革命的硬骨头
    承里
    出席群英大会的英雄们，有许许多多特点值得我们学习。其中之一，就是他们有敢做敢为的硬骨头。
    英雄们的硬骨头，就在于他们对革命事业，忠心耿耿，意志坚强，风吹不动，火烧不毁。他们敢于树雄心，立大志，敢想敢说敢为。平时，他们埋头苦干，踏踏实实，乍看上去，似乎没啥出人头地的地方，但在遇到困难的时候，他们就挺身而出，大胆的迎接困难，克服困难，哪里有困难，哪里就有他们。确实是“事难更显英雄相”，表现了他们的硬骨头。在遇到妖风逆流的时候，他们能顶得住，能逆流前进，表现了他们的硬骨头；在改变我国“一穷二白”面貌上，在改变企业或技术的落后面貌上，表现了他们的硬骨头。
    且看云南的徐学惠同志，十八岁的姑娘，却敢于赤手空拳，与六个手持刀枪的凶恶土匪搏斗。嘴被土匪狠狠地砍了一刀，她还是搏斗；双手被砍了，她还是搏斗。终于保卫了国家财产的安全。这是多么硬的骨头啊！双手失掉了，残废了，她还洋溢着高度的革命乐观主义，毫不为自己的残废而惋惜，又是多么硬的骨头啊！
    再看山东的木工徐呈龙，在第一个五年计划期间，创造和改进六十五种木工方面的机器、工具。节约的工时等于一个普通工人一百三十年的工作量。1958年他又和伙伴们试制、改进机器、工具和推广先进经验三十四项。1959年春季，又在他原来一窍不通的石棉纺织技术上，创造了石棉纺纱机、电动磨光机等机器。其中石棉纺纱机提高效率一百三十多倍。
    英雄们的骨头所以硬，就在于他们忠实于党、忠实于社会主义。他们对党和对党的事业赤胆忠心；捍卫党的事业，英勇不屈；向困难斗争，坚定顽强。
    但是，在我们革命队伍中，还有一种人，他们遇到困难就倒下，遇到邪恶就投降。他们害怕新事物，留恋旧事物；害怕群众运动，喜欢冷冷清清；害怕大踏步前进，喜欢原地不动或迈八字步；害怕多快好省，喜欢少慢差费。另一些人，看见万马奔腾的大跃进后边，飞起米粒大的一点灰尘，就大惊小怪，叫喊着“不得了，不得了”、“糟了，糟了”、“坏了，坏了”……。专给革命的硬骨头泄气和泼冷水，唱反调。他们肆意攻击总路线、大跃进、人民公社化、大炼钢铁等等。这些人中，有的是思想糊涂，有的则生着一根与社会主义事业不相容的“反骨”！
    我们的国家，是个“一穷二白”的大国。要彻底改变这“一穷二白”的面貌，就必须人人要有革命的硬骨头。在改变这“一穷二白”的前进道路上，还有种种困难和邪恶势力，需要我们去克服、去战胜，这也需要我们人人都有革命的硬骨头。而那些“软骨病”的患者，都应当开刀动手术，取出“软骨”或者“反骨”，换上革命的硬骨头！
