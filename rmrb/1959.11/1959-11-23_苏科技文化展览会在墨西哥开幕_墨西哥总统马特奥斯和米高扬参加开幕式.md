Mexican Minister of Industry and Commerce Salinas Lozano and First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Mikoyan spoke at the opening ceremony.

The Soviet Science, Technology, and Culture Achievements Exhibition covers an area of 8,000 square meters and features 16,000 exhibits. This is the first exhibition of such a large scale not only in Mexico but throughout Latin America.

The exhibition is divided into twelve pavilions, including those for agriculture, machinery and machine tool manufacturing, science, power, chemistry, metallurgy, aircraft manufacturing, optical instruments, peaceful use of atomic energy, and automobile manufacturing. Almost every pavilion showcases new products and outstanding achievements of Soviet technical and scientific thought. Among the exhibits are models of the world's first atomic power station, the Soviet "Lenin" atomic icebreaker, the final stage rockets of the three artificial Earth satellites and artificial solar satellites, and the world's largest turboprop airliner, the "Tu-114" aircraft. Models of automatic interplanetary stations and photographs of the far side of the moon are also being exhibited abroad for the first time here.

Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, 21st. TASS reports: First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Mikoyan visited the National Museum and other places of interest in the town of Aricoman on the 20th, and visited the family of local resident Sablabi.

The Soviet guest also visited the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the largest slaughter and refrigeration complex in the country.

Mikoyan was warmly welcomed by teachers, students, and factory workers during his visits to the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the slaughter and refrigeration complex.

During his visit, Mikoyan, at the request of a reporter from the Mexican newspaper "Excelsior," gave a speech to celebrate the 49th anniversary of the Mexican Revolution, the national day of the Mexican people. Mikoyan said, "I ask you to convey my congratulations to the Mexican people on your Revolution Day, which has opened up vast horizons for your social, industrial, and cultural development."

Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, 21st. TASS reports: Mexican newspapers widely commented on the visit of First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Mikoyan to Mexico.

"Excelsior" wrote in an editorial, "We say to Mr. Mikoyan: 'Welcome!' because he is a prominent activist of a country that maintains friendly relations with Mexico." The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet exhibition opened by Mikoyan "actually tells us how well the Soviet Union is at using human intelligence to create abundant material wealth. Therefore, we should learn more from the achievements of the Soviet Union."

"El Nacional," in commenting on Mikoyan's visit, emphasized that Mexico and the Soviet Union share a common position on the issue of comprehensive and complete disarmament and on the issue of colonialism. "El Nacional" pointed out that the Soviet Union's efforts to establish ties with the Western world undoubtedly help eliminate misunderstandings and help clarify the international situation. The newspaper further pointed out that Mikoyan's visit to Mexico, like the visits of leaders from other countries to Mexico, is in line with Mexico's national interests, and closer relations between the Soviet Union and Latin American countries are beneficial to both sides.

"El Popular's" editorial pointed out that Mikoyan "made a significant contribution" to easing international tensions. "El Popular" said: Mikoyan came here as an envoy of goodwill, representing the Soviet government to open the Science, Technology, and Culture Achievements Exhibition, and his arrival is a significant event for Mexico. The newspaper hopes that Mikoyan's visit to Mexico "will help expand trade and cultural ties between Mexico and the Soviet Union."

Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, 20th. TASS reports: Uruguayan newspapers are paying close attention to the visit of First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Mikoyan to Mexico. "El Popular" published an editorial pointing out that Mikoyan's visit to Mexico has caused a "great reaction" in Latin America. The newspaper emphasized that "this is the first time in history that such a prominent Soviet activist has come to the Latin American continent." The newspaper pointed out that this visit is taking place under "new conditions."
