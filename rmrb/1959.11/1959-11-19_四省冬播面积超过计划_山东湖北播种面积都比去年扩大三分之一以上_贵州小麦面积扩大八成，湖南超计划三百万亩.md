　　This newspaper combines Xinhua News Agency dispatches: After combating right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and fully leveraging the superiority of the People's Communes, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, and Guizhou provinces have carried out winter crop planting faster, more extensively, and better this year. Currently, farmers in these four provinces are vigorously strengthening field management to ensure full and thriving seedlings, striving for a bumper summer harvest next year.

　　Shandong Province's plan to sow 65 million mu of winter wheat had been exceeded by more than 2.7 million mu by November 13th, an increase of 35.5% compared to last year. By early November, Hubei Province had sown over 47 million mu of winter crops such as wheat, barley, broad beans, peas, and rapeseed, exceeding the original plan by 7.9%, an increase of over 16 million mu compared to last year. Hunan Province had already completed sowing 31 million mu of winter crops by the end of October, exceeding the original plan by more than 3 million mu. Among these, the rapeseed sowing area exceeded the original plan by 300,000 mu. During the winter planting process, these three provinces encountered the threat of drought. However, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, farmers in the three provinces combatted right-leaning tendencies, boosted morale, fought drought, and rushed to plant, achieving significant victories.

　　Guizhou Province completed winter planting a month earlier than last year, exceeding the target. Wheat was sown on 6.02 million mu, exceeding the plan by 20.5% and an increase of 82% compared to last year. Rapeseed was sown on 6.23 million mu, exceeding the plan by 3.8% and an increase of more than double compared to last year. The sowing area of other miscellaneous grains also exceeded the plan.

　　In order to strive for a large-scale and balanced increase in production next summer, these four provinces universally implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture during winter planting, while also vigorously promoting experimental fields and high-yield fields. Shandong Province established more than 26.7 million mu of large-scale high-yield wheat fields in various regions. In Hubei Province, 5.1 million cadres and masses in the Huanggang, Jingzhou, and Xiaogan special districts jointly cultivated more than 6.6 million mu of experimental fields and high-yield fields. In Hunan Province, according to incomplete statistics from only twenty counties, more than 1.25 million mu of high-yield fields and high-yield plots were established.

    四省冬播面积超过计划
    山东湖北播种面积都比去年扩大三分之一以上
    贵州小麦面积扩大八成，湖南超计划三百万亩
    本报综合新华社消息　经过反右倾、鼓干劲、充分发挥人民公社的优越性，山东、湖北、湖南、贵州四省，今年冬季作物的播种工作进行得又快又多又好。目前，这四个省的农民正大力加强田间管理工作，力保苗全苗旺，争取明年夏季大丰收。
    山东省六千五百万亩的冬小麦播种计划，到11月13日止，已经超额二百七十万多亩完成了，播种面积比去年增加了35.5％。湖北省到11月上旬止，共播种大、小麦，蚕、豌豆和油菜等越冬作物四千七百多万亩，超额7.9％完成了原订计划，比去年扩大了一千六百多万亩。湖南省早在10月底就播种完了冬季作物三千一百多万亩，比原计划扩大三百多万亩。其中油菜播种面积超额三十万亩完成了原订计划。这三个省在冬种过程中，都遇到了干旱的威胁，但是三省农民在各级党委领导下，反右倾，鼓干劲，抗旱抢种，取得了重大胜利。
    贵州省冬种工作比去年提前一个月超额完成。小麦播种六百零二万亩，超过计划20.5％，比去年增加82％；油菜播种六百二十三万亩，超过计划3.8％，比去年增加两倍多，其他杂粮播种面积也都超过了计划。
    为了争取明年夏季大面积平衡增产，这四个省在冬种中普遍贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，同时大搞试验田和丰产田。山东省各地共建立了小麦大面积丰产田二千六百七十多万亩。湖北省黄冈、荆州、孝感三个专区，有五百一十多万干部和群众共搞试验田、丰产田六百六十多万亩。湖南省仅据二十个县的不完全统计，就建立了一百二十五万多亩丰产田和丰产片。
