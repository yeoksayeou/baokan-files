Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Telegram: Following its all-around success in production in October, Benxi Iron and Steel Company's iron and steel production continued to rise comprehensively in November. From the 1st to the 19th, the average daily output of pig iron increased by 2.8% compared to the same period last month and by 0.6% compared to the last ten days of last month; the average daily output of steel increased by 12.3% compared to the same period last month and by 1.4% compared to the last ten days of last month; the average daily output of steel products increased by 13.5% compared to the same period last month and by 20.5% compared to the last ten days of last month.
	During this period, the blast furnace of the First Iron and Steel Plant, which has maintained the national champion title among large and medium-sized blast furnaces for nineteen consecutive months, had an average utilization coefficient of 2.556, an increase of 0.078 compared to the average for the same period last month; the utilization coefficient of the Dongfeng blast furnace of the Second Iron and Steel Plant also reached 2.426. The electric furnace of Benxi Steel Plant, which won the national electric furnace red flag in October, achieved an average utilization coefficient of 42.759, an increase of 2.674 compared to the previous month. Since entering November, the employees of various factories and mines under Benxi Iron and Steel Company, inspired by the National Conference of Heroes, have conscientiously summarized the experiences of October, vigorously promoted the experiences of the Anshan Iron and Steel technical performance competitions, and launched technical performance ten-day activities, thus rapidly forming a high tide of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward. The key to production in various units is constantly broken through, and new records are constantly emerging.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 23rd: Wuhan Iron and Steel employees vigorously promoted the advanced experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel technical performance, constantly overcame weak links, and a new leap forward situation emerged in production in the middle and upper ten days of this month.
	The workers of the No. 1 and No. 2 open-hearth furnaces of the steelmaking plant formulated an operation plan according to the seven processes of furnace repair, charging, heating, molten iron transfer, melting, refining, and steel tapping. Based on the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel, they organized operation performances, and new production records emerged in each process. The workers of Class B of No. 2 open-hearth furnace were the first to break through the design target of producing a furnace of steel every twelve minutes and forty-five seconds with a smelting time of eleven minutes and fifteen seconds; however, in less than eleven hours, the workers of Class C broke the record by smelting a furnace of steel in ten minutes and forty-five seconds. The employees of No. 1 open-hearth furnace also broke through the design output target per furnace seven times in a row starting from the 14th. As a result of implementing the Anshan Iron and Steel technical performance on the two open-hearth furnaces, the steel production in the middle ten days of this month increased by more than 15% compared to the first ten days.
	The experience of Anshan Iron and Steel's one-dragon competition and technical performance competition has also blossomed brilliantly in the blast furnaces of Wuhan Iron and Steel. As early as during the National Conference of Heroes, Wuhan Iron and Steel Plant sent people to Anshan Iron and Steel to learn about competition experience, and the plant's Party committee also organized a working group to focus on promotion in the No. 2 blast furnace. After the performance competition, the charging, hot blast stove replacement, and iron tapping time of this blast furnace were shortened by a quarter to a half or more. With the addition of measures such as more charging and increased blast temperature, the iron production in the middle ten days increased by 5% compared to the first ten days even when the raw materials were not ideal.
	After the coking workshop of the coking plant promoted the technical performance competition, it quickly broke through the key problems such as insufficient coke charging and failure to stack coke at fixed points. The average daily output in the upper and middle ten days of November exceeded the average daily output in the last ten days of October by more than 15%.

    再接再厉不松劲　一鼓作气干到底
    本钢生产继续全面上升
    武钢推行技术表演赛钢产量中旬超上旬
    新华社沈阳电　本溪钢铁公司继10月份生产满堂红之后，11月份钢铁生产继续全面上升。1日至19日，生铁平均日产量比上月同期提高2.8％，比上月下旬提高0.6％；钢平均日产量比上月同期提高12.3％，比上月下旬提高1.4％；钢材平均日产量比上月同期提高13.5％，比上月下旬提高20.5％。
    在这个期间，连续十九个月保持全国大中型高炉冠军的第一钢铁厂的高炉，平均利用系数为二点五五六，比上月同期平均提高零点零七八；第二钢铁厂东风号高炉利用系数也已达到二点四二六。夺得10月全国电炉红旗的本溪钢厂电炉，平均利用系数达到四二点七五九，比上月又提高二点六七四。进入11月份以来，本溪钢铁公司所属各厂矿职工，在全国群英会的鼓舞下，认真总结10月份的经验，大力推广鞍钢技术表演赛的经验，又开展了技术表演旬的活动，因而迅速形成比先进，学先进，赶先进，帮后进的高潮。各单位生产关键不断突破，新纪录不断出现。
    新华社武汉23日电武钢职工大力推广鞍钢技术表演的先进经验，不断克服薄弱环节，本月上中两旬生产出现了新的跃进局面。
    炼钢厂一、二号平炉的工人，按补炉、装料、加热、兑铁水、熔化、精炼、出钢七道工序，订出作业计划，根据鞍钢经验组织了操作表演，每道工序都出现了新的生产纪录。二号平炉乙班工人以十一点十五分的冶炼时间最先突破了每十二点四十五分出一炉钢的设计指标；但是，不到十一小时，丙班工人又以十点四十五分炼一炉钢打破了这项纪录。一号平炉上的职工，从14日起也连续七次突破了每炉的设计产量指标。两座平炉推行鞍钢技术表演的结果，本月中旬的钢产量比上旬提高了15％以上。
    鞍钢的一条龙竞赛和技术表演赛的经验，在武钢高炉上也开出了鲜丽的花朵。早在全国群英会期间，武钢炼铁厂就派专人到鞍钢学习竞赛经验，厂党委还组织工作组在二号高炉上作重点推广。表演竞赛以后，这个高炉的装料、换热风炉和出铁时间，缩短了四分之一到二分之一以上，加上多装料、提高风温等措施，中旬在原料不够理想的情况下，铁产量比上旬提高了5％。
    焦化厂炼焦车间推广了技术表演赛以后，迅速突破了炉子装焦不满和不能定点堆焦等关键问题，11月上、中两旬的平均日产量超过10月下旬的平均日产量15％以上。
