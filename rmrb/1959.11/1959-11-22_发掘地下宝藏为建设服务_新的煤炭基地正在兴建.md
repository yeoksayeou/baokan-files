    Exploiting Underground Treasures for Construction
    New Coal Base Under Construction
    (Our report) As industrial and agricultural production flourishes in Liangshan, Guizhou, known as the high and cold area of northwestern Guizhou, coal industry construction is being vigorously carried out. It will gradually be built into an important coal base in southwestern China.
    In addition to abundant reserves of iron, lead, zinc, copper, and other minerals, northwestern Guizhou Province also has extremely rich coal deposits. After several years of hard work by geological exploration personnel, it has been confirmed as the region with the largest proven coal reserves in the Southwest. The coalfields in these areas have complete grades and excellent quality, which can meet the needs of various industrial coal uses. The Shuicheng and Langdai areas are currently being developed through well construction, with Langdai having a larger construction scale. Since the second half of last year, eleven pairs of coal wells have been started here. These coal wells will all use mechanized production, and after completion, the annual production capacity of raw coal will be 4.11 million tons. Most of these newly built coal wells will be completed and put into production successively next year.
    Starting in August and September this year, in order to adapt to the needs of the province's iron and steel, machinery, electricity, and other industries' new leap forward situation, the coal front workers decided to put the Liangshui well No. 1 and No. 2, which were planned to be put into production in the first quarter of next year, into production by the end of this year ahead of schedule. The annual production capacity of these two pairs of wells is 360,000 tons of raw coal. At present, the roadway excavation project of these two pairs of wells has been completed, and they are rushing to the coal mining work surface and installing mine ventilation, lifting, and other equipment.
    In order to ensure the smooth progress of well construction and production, other auxiliary projects are also under active construction. The special line connecting to the Yunnan-Guizhou railway line under construction has been surveyed and will soon be constructed. The mining machinery repair and assembly plant, which is responsible for the repair, assembly, and parts production of mining machinery, is under vigorous construction. Of the two newly built power plants, one is under construction, and the other is nearing completion. One of the two coal washing plants has been basically completed, with an annual coal washing capacity of about 300,000 tons. The prototype of a new type of mining area has basically taken shape in this area.
    In the process of construction, this mining area has received strong support from all over the country. Kailuan, Fushun, Fengfeng, and other coal mines have successively sent more than 1,000 workers and technicians in design, installation, and mining to help with construction. Coal mining schools in Beijing, Chongqing, Northeast, and North China have also sent a large number of students to support. Anshan, Wuhan, Shanghai, Chongqing and other regions have also sent various materials such as steel rails, cement, and machines, so that the construction of this mining area can proceed smoothly.

### 发掘地下宝藏为建设服务  新的煤炭基地正在兴建

    发掘地下宝藏为建设服务
    新的煤炭基地正在兴建
    本报讯　被称为黔西北高寒地区的贵州凉山，随着工农业生产的蓬勃发展，正在大力进行煤炭工业的建设。它将逐步建成为我国西南一个重要的煤炭基地。
    贵州省西北部除蕴藏着大量的铁、铅、锌、铜等矿产外，还埋藏着极其丰富的煤。经过地质勘探人员几年来的辛勤劳动，已证实它是西南区目前煤藏量最大的一个地区。这些地区的煤田具有牌号齐全、质量优良等特点，能满足各种工业用煤的需要。目前正在建井开发的有水城、郎岱两个地区，其中郎岱的建设规模较大。从去年下半年起，在这里先后动工兴建的煤井有十一对。这些煤井都将采用机械化生产，建成后年产原煤能力为四百十一万吨。这些新建的煤井，大部分都将在明年陆续建成并投入生产。
    从今年8、9月开始，煤炭战线职工们为适应全省钢铁、机械、电力等工业新的跃进形势需要，决定把计划在明年第一季度投入生产的凉水井一、二号井，提前在今年底建成投入生产。这两对井的年产原煤能力为三十六万吨。目前，这两对井的巷道掘进工程已经完成，正在突击采煤工作面和安装矿井的通风、提升等设备。
    为了保证建井和生产的顺利进行，其它辅助工程也在积极施工。衔接正在修建的滇黔铁路线的专用线，已经勘探完毕，不久就要施工。担负矿山机械修理、装配和零件生产的矿山机器修配厂，正在大兴土木。新建的两座发电厂，一座正在施工，一座接近收尾。两座洗煤厂，已有一座基本建成，每年能洗煤三十万吨左右。一个新型煤矿区的雏形，已在这个地区基本形成。
    这个矿区在建设过程中，得到全国各地的大力支援。开滦、抚顺、峰峰等煤矿，先后派出一千多名设计、安装、开矿等工人和技术人员，帮助建设。北京、重庆、东北和华北等地区的煤矿学校，也派来大批学生支援。鞍山、武汉、上海和重庆等地区，还送来了钢轨、水泥和机器等各种物资，使这个矿区的建设得以顺利进行。　（贺永丰）
