    Han Dynasty Pottery Pavilions

    The ornate Han rhapsodies contain many descriptions of pavilions. After more than a thousand years, it is indeed a challenge for us to understand the truth about Han Dynasty pavilion architecture today. Fortunately, people at that time unintentionally prepared keys for us to understand the problem, that is, the pottery pavilion models unearthed from Han tombs. In recent years, many such pottery pavilions have been discovered in Eastern Han tombs in many regions such as Henan, Hebei, Guangdong, Hunan, and Sichuan. Ancient people treated death as if it were life. In the Han Dynasty, they made models of almost everything needed for clothing, food, housing, and transportation before death and placed them in tombs. Pottery pavilions were one of these.
    Han Dynasty pottery pavilions have two or three stories. Most of them have flat seats with railings above the first floor, and then are built upwards layer by layer. At the corners, brackets are used to support the eaves. The stairs to the upper floors are in the center of the building, because temporary stairs were commonly used in the buildings at that time. They were set up when needed and removed when not needed, so some buildings only have round or square holes for ascending and descending. The roof is often a hip roof, with tiled ridges on the top, and some are even made into the popular cloud-patterned tile ends of the time.
    The most exquisite one is the green-glazed pavilion unearthed in Shan County, Henan. The structure is very complex. It stands in the center of a circular pool, in which many ducks, fish, and turtles are playing. Several horse-riding knights surround the pool. This pottery pavilion has three floors, and the structure is also different. The first floor is mainly the pillars and stairs standing in the pool. The four corners are supported by bear-shaped corner gods supporting the flat seat of the second floor. The second and third floors are all built on platforms surrounded by railings. At the four corners, on the heads of the extended beams, there is a bracket with one dou and two sheng, which is used to support the extended eaves. The four walls are full of rectangular window holes, which are very exquisite and beautiful. In the room on the second floor, there is a Liubo game board in the center, and four people are playing around it. On the platform outside the room, four guards stand at each corner, holding crossbows, ready to shoot. The same warriors also stand on the third floor.
    In addition to single pottery pavilions, a two-story pottery pavilion unearthed in Guangzhou has annexes, courtyards, gates, toilets, and livestock pens. These buildings are organically combined together, with different heights and distinct primary and secondary elements, forming a complete architectural complex.
    These pottery pavilions show the high skills of Han Dynasty architecture and are excellent materials for studying pavilion architecture at that time. Not only that, they are also extremely precious Han Dynasty artworks, and at the same time provide a true portrayal of social life and class relations at that time. (With pictures)

    汉代陶楼阁
    易水
    词藻华美的汉赋里有不少关于楼阁的描述，经过了千余年以后，我们现在想了解汉代楼阁建筑的真相，确实是个难题。幸而当时的人在无意中给我们准备好了解题的钥匙，那就是汉墓里出土的陶制楼阁模型。这种陶楼阁，近几年来在河南、河北、广东、湖南、四川等许多地区的东汉墓中，发现过不少件。古人事死如事生，在汉代，几乎把生前衣、食、住、行所需之物都作成模型放在坟墓里，陶制楼阁就是其中的一种。
    汉代的陶楼阁，有两层的，也有三层的，大多是在第一层以上是围有栏杆的平座，然后再向上逐层起建。在转角处，用斗拱来支托屋檐。上楼的梯子在屋内的正中央，因为当时楼中常用不固定的楼梯，用时陈设，不用时撤去，因此有些楼中只有上下贯通的升降用的圆孔或方孔。楼顶常是四阿式的，顶上作出瓦垅，有的还作成当时流行的云纹瓦当。
    其中最精致的要算是　河南陕县出土的一座绿釉楼阁，结构很复杂，它耸立在圆形水池的中央，池里有许多鸭、鱼和鳖在嬉游，池边环绕着几个骑马的骑士。这座陶楼共有三层，结构也不同，第一层主要是竖在池中的支柱和楼梯，四角用熊形角神支顶着第二层的平座，第二、三层都是在绕有栏杆的平台上建起的，四角是在伸出的梁枋头上，坐有一朵一斗二升的斗栱，用其来承托伸出的楼檐，四壁上开满长方形的窗孔，显得十分玲珑秀丽。在第二层屋内，中央放着一副六博盘子，四个人围着它相博。在屋外的平台上，四角各站着一个卫士，手里端着弩机，作准备放射的样子，在第三层也站有同样的武士。
    除了单座的陶楼以外，在广州出土过一种两层的陶楼，它附有厢房、院落、大门、厕所和牲畜圈，这些建筑物有机的配合在一起，高低参错、主次分明，形成完整的建筑组合。
    这些陶楼阁，显示出汉代建筑的高度技巧，是研究当时楼阁建筑的绝好资料。不仅如此，也是极珍贵的汉代艺术品，同时又提供了对当时社会生活和阶级关系的真实写照。（附图片）
