Right Opportunists' Indifference to Socialism

    Right opportunists say that our Great Leap Forward is a manifestation of "petty-bourgeois frenzy," which precisely demonstrates their bourgeois revolutionaries' indifference to socialism. To put it more accurately, it is not just "indifference," but reaction.

    What the bourgeoisie is frenetic about is getting rich through exploitation, and they are not interested in anything else. We want to eliminate exploitation, and bourgeois revolutionaries, according to their class instinct, are naturally unhappy. Now, after the decisive victory of the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, we must exert our utmost efforts and strive for the top, to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, and those people take a cold and even opposing attitude. They think: you workers, peasants, and bumpkins will never be able to do anything well. So they always obliterate achievements and exaggerate shortcomings in socialist transformation and construction. Lenin said: "Malicious joy over difficulties and setbacks in the transformation, spreading panic, advocating turning back – all this is a tool and means for bourgeois intellectuals to wage class struggle. The proletariat will not allow itself to be deceived." ("The Great Beginning") This is our situation now: the proletariat and all working people are eager to get rid of exploitation and poverty, and are advancing bravely towards socialism and communism; the bourgeoisie and its intellectuals, as well as right opportunists who have sneaked into the revolutionary ranks and have not been thoroughly transformed, are always shouting "can't do it," advocating turning back, and shaking people's confidence in progress. This is class struggle. This struggle exists throughout the entire transition period. Every time we do something, every time we move forward, we will encounter this struggle.

    Right opportunism is a reflection of bourgeois ideology in our ranks. Right opportunists, starting from bourgeois individualism, carry a program of capitalist democracy in their pockets and "invest" in the ranks of the people's revolution, just as Gorky incisively pointed out, they participate in the revolution "only because they want to replace the people who were sitting on the people's heads at that time, so that they can sit on them more firmly." ("More on Mechanical Citizens") Therefore, during the democratic revolution, they did show a burst of enthusiasm for the democratic revolution; now that the democratic revolution has succeeded, and the people want to continue with the socialist revolution, they naturally have no such interest, let alone such enthusiasm. If they don't discard bourgeois individualism in the revolutionary process, of course they can't muster the enthusiasm for the socialist revolution, of course they will reflect the bourgeois ideological sentiment of resisting socialism, and of course they will show bourgeois pessimism. How do they reflect and express bourgeois ideological sentiments? They have made revolution, have some knowledge of Marxism, and have some experience in revolutionary struggle. These were originally good things, but now they are using them to serve their bourgeois individualism, as "capital" to oppose the Party's leadership of the people on the road to socialism. The Party's general line, the socialist enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of people, and the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward can all be ignored in their eyes, they want to open up a new path, establish a unique banner, and find some so-called "pitch-black" materials in all directions, and "elevate" it to the height of theory, line, and policy to scare people.

    The purpose of right opportunists in spreading the fallacy of "petty-bourgeois frenzy" is to oppose the Party's general line of socialist construction that combines objective laws and subjective initiative. As is well known, the general line put forward by our Party is based on the principles of Marxism, on the specific conditions of our country, on the current domestic and international situation, and on the urgent demands of the people of the whole country, and was put forward after repeated discussions and careful consideration. The people of the whole country urgently demand such a general line, and resolutely carry out selfless struggle in accordance with this general line, in order to seize the opportunity and get rid of the "poor and blank" state of our country as soon as possible, so as to make the country stronger and the people's lives happier. Right opportunists oppose the Party's general line, singing a different tune, pouring cold water on the urgent desire of the broad masses of the people to get rid of poverty and backwardness, and the soaring enthusiasm that has been brought forth as a result. They attempt to stop the Great Leap Forward, negate the people's communes, and tamper with the general line. The reactionary essence of their treasured arguments lies here.

    Is it too late rather than too early? Do they feel it's good or bad?

    Right opportunists slander the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune movement as committing "leftist" adventurist errors, and their argument is that you have done things too early and done them badly.

    "Early" and "bad" cannot scare us.

    What does "early" mean? Is it better for the people to be liberated and happy, and for the security of the motherland and world peace to be better guaranteed, sooner or later? Is it better to be fast or slow? Is it better to exert our utmost efforts and strive for the top, or is it better to slacken and retreat to the bottom? Anyone who truly approves of socialism, when they hear the general line, see the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, and feel that our direction is so clear, our people are so diligent and brave, and our cause is developing so fast, cannot help but feel unprecedented excitement and comfort. The broad masses of cadres and people only feel that socialism is good, not bad, only hate that it's too late, not too early; even if some people are a little too hasty in doing some things at certain times, that is understandable, and it is good to persuade them to adjust. When you have a clear direction on everything, you should advance like a broken bamboo and be invincible. Increase your talents in practice, absorb experience and lessons, and gradually improve and raise your level, and you should not be afraid of the dragon in front and the tiger behind.

    Is this only looking at needs and not possibilities?

    We say that we must look at needs and possibilities. Possibilities must be considered, but the question is how to look at them. Right opportunists always see the possible as impossible. The arguments of their "impossibility theory" usually have two points: first, "objective conditions are not yet ripe," and second, "subjectively, there is not enough experience." However, we also have two points: first, revolution requires objective conditions, but objective conditions require people to strive for and create them based on objective conditions and their laws. Sitting still, even for a thousand years, will never reach maturity; second, revolution requires experience, but experience must be gained from practice. Sitting still, even for a thousand years, will still have no experience. Which of the two "two points" is the active spirit of Marxism and which is the passive attitude of opportunism is not difficult to identify. The question now in dispute is the general line and the Great Leap Forward. We believe that initiating a study of the question of "whether it is possible to implement the Great Leap Forward and realize the general line" today is a bit ridiculous and laughable. It has been more than a year since the general line was proposed and the Great Leap Forward was realized. At the beginning of determining the general line, our Party not only studied needs, but also studied possibilities, and believed that we not only needed a Great Leap Forward, but also could have a Great Leap Forward. After more than a year of practical testing, it has fully proved that our Party's assessment is correct. We have achieved amazing great achievements on all fronts, including industry, agriculture, and science and culture. This is a fact, and even our enemies have to admit this fact sadly. What right opportunists attack most vigorously and strongly say is "early" and "bad" is the people's commune, but the people's commune has not collapsed. On the contrary, it has become more and more fully demonstrating its superiority in the Great Leap Forward, but because it has thoroughly buried capitalism, right opportunists do not like it, and are unwilling and dare not admit it. However, we are doing revolution, and we do not intend to be liked by them, nor do we need their "approval." As we see it, the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the superiority of the people's communes are objective existences, whether you admit it or not, it is like this.

    Shortcomings cannot be exaggerated, let alone achievements be obliterated

    Right opportunists say: "Ah, your petty-bourgeois frenzy is also manifested here: exaggeration, lack of modesty, only talking about achievements, not talking about shortcomings."

    We say that we must talk about achievements and also talk about shortcomings. Achievements must be talked about enough, and only when they are talked about enough can they be carried forward and brought to light; shortcomings must be talked about thoroughly, and only when they are talked about thoroughly can lessons be learned and negative factors be turned into positive factors. But right opportunists are very dismissive of "achievements must be talked about enough," thinking that this is "exaggeration"; they are most interested in "shortcomings are talked about thoroughly," saying that this is "modesty." They are so "modest" to the extent of being "weak of heart" about the revolutionary cause, as if revolution is something that goes against their conscience, and any achievements are denied across the board, and even achievements are spoken of as shortcomings; any shortcomings are exaggerated and enlarged, turning a finger problem into a ten-finger problem, saying that things are not worth the loss, a complete mess, with a bleak future and no hope, so as to prove their argument that "because it is 'early', it is 'bad', and it cannot be done." We say that the debate over "bad" and "not bad" is a struggle that is usually encountered in the progress of the revolution. In the eyes of the exploiting classes, the people want to "rebel," and crude and clumsy workers and peasants want to talk about revolution and construction, breaking the normal order and the quiet life of the "masters" of the old society for thousands of years, which is really the worst thing that could happen. And in our opinion, they scold us for being "bad," which is precisely proof that we are doing well. Therefore, in our work, we must first have this class viewpoint and revolutionary confidence in the view of achievements and shortcomings. Exaggerating achievements and concealing shortcomings is wrong, but exaggerating shortcomings and obliterating achievements is even more wrong. Our cause is always advancing. As long as the line is correct, the achievements and shortcomings of what hundreds of millions of people are doing are always a relationship of nine fingers and one finger. Obliterating achievements, saying that this is not right and that is not right, nothing is right, that is denying that our cause is always advancing, denying that our cause can advance, making people feel dejected, shrinking, and shaking people's confidence in progress. In order to advance, we must affirm achievements. How many achievements there are, we will talk about how many achievements there are, and talk about the achievements enough. This is not "exaggeration," but precisely seeking truth from facts. Similarly, in order to advance, we must also face up to shortcomings. Whatever shortcomings there are, we will talk about what shortcomings there are, and talk about the shortcomings thoroughly. But, thoroughly must be truly thorough, and we must think carefully: first, what is called a shortcoming? Second, what kind and what degree of shortcomings are there? Third, why are there shortcomings? Fourth, what is the purpose of checking shortcomings? Fifth, what attitude should we take towards shortcomings? Revolution is not wearing white gloves to embroider flowers, but a sharp and complex class struggle; revolution does not rely on a few "sages and heroes" who have thought out a set of ideas in advance to hard apply them to facts, but on the broad masses to create in practice; revolution is not routine work, but advancing in constant exploration and creation. Therefore, although we always try to avoid shortcomings as much as possible, shortcomings are always unavoidable. However, shortcomings are always factors that appear temporarily and play a temporary role in the process of advancement (precisely because of this, we say that it is "one finger out of ten fingers"), and they can always be overcome. From recognizing and overcoming shortcomings, we can gain experience and lessons, increase our knowledge, and do things better. And we always check shortcomings for this purpose. Taking a bourgeois aristocratic master-like attitude towards the masses, pointing fingers at the creations and struggles of the masses, picking faults in every possible way, arbitrarily cursing and ridiculing certain shortcomings, saying that revolution is not allowed to have any shortcomings, is in essence not allowing revolution, throwing the baby out with the bath water. Right opportunists seize on certain shortcomings in our progress, seize on shortcomings that we have overcome and are overcoming, even seize on shortcomings that do not constitute shortcomings, and even seize on our achievements as shortcomings to attack us, but that cannot defeat us.

    Overcoming Rightism is the Main Task at Present

    Right opportunists say: "China is a country where the petty bourgeoisie accounts for the majority of the population, and there are also many people in the revolutionary ranks who come from the petty bourgeoisie. Therefore, petty-bourgeois frenzy is the most difficult to correct. Their dogmatism kills people. Their 'leftist' adventurism is the main danger within the Party."

    We say that this cannot be generalized. The petty bourgeoisie is a "class between the hammer of the bourgeoisie and the anvil of the proletariat" (Gorky). During the democratic revolution, they suffered from the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and had a strong demand for democratic revolution, but their world view was basically the bourgeois individualism and subjectivism. After they participated in the revolution, some people transformed themselves into proletarian fighters through revolutionary training (this is the majority), while others showed great wavering (this is the minority). The latter group of people are prone to frenzy and commit "leftist" errors when the environment is favorable, but when they encounter difficulties and setbacks, they are prone to pessimism and despair, and commit rightist errors. If we generalize, because there are many people in our Party who come from the petty bourgeoisie, it seems that our Party is a petty-bourgeois party; because some petty-bourgeois people have been frenzied, it is believed that they only have "leftism," and we can only oppose "leftism," which is a slander against the Party and a distortion of history. In the past, our Party had several "leftist" errors, but also several rightist errors such as Chen Duxiuism. Among them, some people have also swayed from "left" to right, and from "left" to right. However, our Party has always been realistic, opposing "leftism" when there is "leftism," and opposing rightism when there is rightism. No matter "leftist" or rightist errors, the Party has corrected them, and we have therefore gained revolutionary experience and won revolutionary victories.

    The main class struggle in the entire transition period is the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Now, the socialist transformation of capitalist ownership and petty-bourgeois individual ownership has been basically completed, but it will take a considerable amount of time for bourgeois elements to fully adapt to the new system of the new society. In addition, capitalism still exists in the world, so bourgeois ideology will constantly impact our ranks and be reflected in our ranks. And those in our ranks who are divorced from the masses and have not abandoned bourgeois individualism are prone to growing arrogance and old age in this environment of peaceful construction, losing their direction, and losing their spirit of continuous revolution and active progress. Some people are not vigilant enough about the danger of rightism, do not deeply hate right opportunism, and even have some resonance. They are not so righteous in the face of major issues of principle, they are not so lively in their work, and they always want to "live in the middle reaches." There are also some people who have lost their position and become right opportunists. In this situation, right opportunism has become the main danger in the revolutionary cause.

    The class root of right opportunism is the reflection of bourgeois ideology in our Party, and its ideological root is subjective idealistic empiricism. Their world view, outlook on life, and way of thinking are solipsism, empiricism, thinking themselves infallible, thinking they know everything, looking at problems with their own subjective and one-sided feelings and experience, just like Berkeley said: "To be is to be perceived." Based on a little bit of what they perceive, they seize on a little bit of fragmented, chaotic surface phenomena and false materials, taking a part for the whole, taking a glimpse through a tube, and being unable to distinguish or unwilling to distinguish between the nine fingers and one finger problem, distinguishing between essence and phenomenon, mainstream and branch, general and individual, overall situation and small situation, factors that play a constant role and factors that play a temporary role; as long as it is something that is beneficial to their bourgeois individualism and right opportunism, it is the truth, and they seize it and use it as a magic weapon to confront the Party's general line and oppose the people's Great Leap Forward. Their empiricism is extremely reactionary subjective idealism. They take advantage of the fact that the dogmatism of those "leftist" adventurers in the past history caused great harm, and under the banner of "anti-dogmatism," they sell revisionist goods. But history has proved that although dogmatism kills people, empiricism also kills people in the same way, especially this subjective idealistic empiricism of right opportunists, which is even more harmful. We oppose right opportunism because this is what is blocking our way now. Every time we move forward, they shout. What "petty-bourgeois frenzy is the most difficult to correct," what "dogmatism kills people," what "'leftism' is the main danger within the Party," they have completely reversed the words!

    Right opportunists are our negative teachers. The more actively they sell their rightist remarks and carry out rightist activities, the more we can see them clearly, and the more we know to be deeply vigilant. There are at least these few things to be vigilant about: we should not be centrists in the face of major issues of principle! It is impossible to live in the "middle reaches" in the Great Leap Forward! In the great storm of socialist revolution, we must thoroughly dig out bourgeois individualism, empiricism, and any conservative and backward-driving thoughts!

    Right opportunists attempt to overthrow the general line and oppose the Great Leap Forward, so they slander our Great Leap Forward as "the frenzy of the petty bourgeoisie," pouring cold water on us; we should go the other way, and always maintain full enthusiasm, leap forward, and leap forward again, leap forward in the direction pointed out by our Party's great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, and under the illumination of the general line, carry out the communist cause to the end!

    驳所谓“小资产阶级狂热性”的谬论王执生
    右倾机会主义者对社会主义的冷淡性
    右倾机会主义者说我们的大跃进是“小资产阶级狂热性”的表现，这适足以表现出他们那种资产阶级革命家对于社会主义的冷淡性。说得更恰当些，还不只是什么“冷淡”性，而是反动性。
    资产阶级所狂热的事情，就是靠剥削发财，其它一切都不感兴趣。我们要消灭剥削，资产阶级革命家按照其阶级本能，当然是不高兴的。现在，当经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命取得决定性的胜利之后，我们要鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义，那些人就采取冷眼旁观以至反对的态度。他们想：你们这些工人、农民、土包子，总归是办不好什么事情的。所以他们对于社会主义改造和建设总是抹煞成绩，夸大缺点。列宁说过：“对转变中的困难和挫折幸灾乐祸，散布惊慌情绪，宣传开倒车，——这一切是资产阶级知识分子进行阶级斗争的工具和手段。无产阶级是不会让自己受骗的。”（“伟大的创举”）现在我们的事情就是这样：无产阶级和一切劳动人民，迫切要求摆脱剥削和贫困，勇往直前地向着社会主义、共产主义迈进；资产阶级及其知识分子，以及混在革命队伍中间尚未得到彻底改造的右倾机会主义分子，却总是大叫“干不得”，宣传开倒车，动摇人们前进的信心。这就是阶级斗争。整个过渡时期始终存在着这种斗争。我们每干一件事、每前进一步，总会遇到这种斗争。
    右倾机会主义是资产阶级思想在我们队伍里的反映。右倾机会主义分子从资产阶级个人主义出发，口袋里放着一个资本主义民主主义的纲领到人民革命的队伍里来“入股”，就像高尔基一针见血地说过的，他们参加革命，“只不过是因为想把当时坐在人民头上的人换掉，让自己更稳固地坐上去。”（“再论机械的公民”）因此在民主革命时期，他们确也鼓起过一阵民主革命的干劲；现在，民主革命成功了，人民要继续搞社会主义革命，他们自然没有这种兴趣，更没有这种干劲。在革命进程里没有丢掉资产阶级个人主义，当然提不起社会主义革命的劲头，当然要反映出资产阶级抗拒社会主义的思想情绪，当然会表现出资产阶级的悲观主义。他们怎么来反映和表现资产阶级的思想情绪呢？他们是革过命的，有一些马克思主义的知识，又有点革命斗争的经验，这些本来都是好东西，但是他们现在拿来为自己的资产阶级个人主义服务，作为反对党领导人民走社会主义道路的“本钱”。党的总路线，千百万人民的社会主义积极性，大跃进的伟大成就，都可以不放在他们的眼睛里，他们要另辟途径，独树一帜，四方八面地找出些所谓“漆黑一团”的材料，并把它“提高”到理论、路线、政策的高度，拿来吓唬人。
    右倾机会主义分子散布“小资产阶级狂热性”的谬论的目的，就是要反对党的以客观规律和主观能动性相结合的社会主义建设总路线。如所周知，我们党提出的这条总路线，是根据马克思主义的原理，根据我国的具体条件，根据当前国内外形势和全国人民的迫切要求，并且经过反复讨论和深思熟虑而提出的。全国人民迫切要求有这么一条总路线，而且坚决地照着这条总路线进行忘我的斗争，是为了争取时机，尽快地摆脱我国“一穷二白”的状态，使国家更加富强、人民生活更加幸福。右倾机会主义者反对党的总路线，大唱其对台戏，对于广大人民迫切要求摆脱贫困和落后生活的愿望，以及由此而发挥出来的冲天干劲，大泼冷水。他们企图阻止大跃进、否定人民公社、篡改总路线。他们那套宝贝论调的反动实质，就是在这里。
    嫌其迟不嫌其早?觉其好不觉其糟
    右倾机会主义者诽谤总路线、大跃进和人民公社运动是犯了“左倾”冒险主义的错误，他们的论据就是你们把事情干早了、干糟了。
    “早”和“糟”，并不能吓倒我们。
    什么叫做“早”？人民要解放、幸福，祖国安全和世界和平要得到更好的保障，早好还是迟好？快好还是慢好？鼓足干劲、力争上游好？还是松劲泄气、退居下游好？凡是一个真正赞成社会主义的人，听到了总路线，看见了大跃进和人民公社，感到我们的方向这么明确，我们的人民这么勤劳勇敢，我们的事业发展得这么快，莫不感到从来没有的兴奋、舒畅。广大干部、群众对于社会主义只觉其好，不觉其糟，只嫌其迟，不嫌其早；就是某些人在某些时候对某些事情办得急了一点，那也是可以理解的，说服他们调整一下好了。凡事看准了方向就应当势如破竹、所向披靡地朝前干，在实践中增长才干，吸收经验教训，逐步改进、提高，不应当前怕龙，后怕虎。
    这是不是只看需要，不看可能呢？
    我们说，要看需要也要看可能。可能是要看的，但问题是怎么看法。右倾机会主义者总是把可能看成不可能。他们的“不可能论”的论据，照例有两条：一曰“客观上条件不成熟”，二曰“主观上经验又不足”。然而我们也有两条：第一，革命是要讲客观条件的，但客观条件要人们根据客观情况及其规律去争取、去创造，坐着不动，过一千年，条件也永无成熟之期；第二，革命是要有经验的，但经验要从实践中得来，坐着不动，过一千年也还是没有经验。两个“两条”，哪个是马克思主义的积极精神，哪个是机会主义的消极态度，这是不难识别的。现在争论的问题是总路线、大跃进。我们认为：时至今日来发起研究什么“实行大跃进、实现总路线是否可能”的问题，未免有点使人觉得又好气又好笑。提出总路线，实现大跃进，于今已有一年多了。在确定总路线之初，我们党就不仅研究过需要，也研究过可能，认为我们不仅需要大跃进，而且可能大跃进。经过一年多实践的考验，完全证明我们党的估计是正确的。我们在工业、农业和科学文化等各条战线上，都获得了惊人的伟大成就，这是事实，连我们的敌人也不得不伤心地承认这个事实。右倾机会主义者攻击最力而力言其“早”和“糟”的是人民公社，但是，人民公社并没有垮掉，相反的，在大跃进中越来越充分地显出了它的优越性，不过由于它彻底地埋葬了资本主义，所以右倾机会主义者不喜欢它，不肯也不敢承认它而已。但是，我们干革命，本来就不打算要他们喜欢，也用不着经他们“批准”。照我们看来，总路线，大跃进，以及人民公社的优越性，这是客观存在，你承认也好，不承认也好，它都是这样。
    缺点不能夸大　成绩更不能抹煞
    右倾机会主义者说：“好啊，你们的小资产阶级狂热性也正表现在这里：浮夸，不虚心，只讲成绩，不讲缺点。”
    我们说，要讲成绩，也要讲缺点。成绩要讲够，讲够才能发扬光大；缺点要讲透，讲透才能吸取教训，变消极因素为积极因素。但右倾机会主义者，对于“成绩要讲够”大不以为然，认为这就是“浮夸”；对于“缺点讲透”最感兴趣，说这就是“虚心”。他们“虚心”到对革命事业“心虚”的程度，仿佛革命是什么亏心事，凡有成绩就一概否认，甚至把成绩讲成缺点；凡有缺点就夸而大之，把一个指头的问题说成十个指头的问题，把事情说成得不偿失，一团漆黑，前途渺茫，毫无希望，这样来证实其“因为‘早’、所以‘糟’，干不得”的论调。我们说，“糟”不“糟”的争论，是在革命进展中通常会遇到的一个斗争。在剥削阶级看来，人民要“造反”，粗手笨脚的工人、农民要讲什么革命和建设，打破了几千年来旧社会的正常秩序和“老爷”们的安静生活，那真是再“糟”也没有的事情了。而在我们看来，他们骂我们“糟”，那就正是证明我们干的好。因此我们在工作里，对于成绩和缺点的看法，首先就要有这种阶级观点和革命信心。夸大成绩，掩盖缺点，那是错误的，但是，夸大缺点，抹煞成绩，更是错误的。我们的事业总是在前进，只要路线正确，几亿人民所干的事情，成绩和缺点总是九个指头和一个指头的关系。抹煞成绩，这也不是，那也不是，一无所是，那就是否认我们的事业总在前进，否认我们的事业能够前进，把人们说得垂头丧气，缩手缩脚，动摇人们前进的信心。我们为了前进，就要肯定成绩，有几分成绩就讲几分成绩，把成绩讲够，这不是什么“浮夸”，而正是实事求是。同样的，为了前进，也要正视缺点，有什么缺点就讲什么缺点，把缺点讲透。但，透要真透，要好生想清楚：第一，什么叫做缺点？第二，什么性质和什么程度的缺点？第三，为什么会有缺点？第四，为着什么来检查缺点？第五，拿什么态度来对待缺点？革命不是戴着白手套来绣花，而是尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争；革命不是靠少数“圣贤豪杰”预先想好了一套去硬套事实，而要靠广大群众在实践中创造；革命不是例行公事，而是在不断的摸索、创造中前进的。所以，虽然我们总是尽可能避免缺点，但是缺点总是难免的。然而缺点总是在前进中暂时出现、暂时起作用的因素（正因为此，所以我们说它是“十个指头里的一个指头”），而且总是可以克服的。我们从认识和克服缺点中能够得到经验教训，增长见识，把事情办得更好。而我们检查缺点，也总是为了这个目的。拿出一副资产阶级贵族老爷式的态度对待群众，对群众的创造和斗争指手划脚，百般挑剔，对某些缺点任意咒骂、嘲笑，说是干革命不准有一点缺点，那实质上就是不准革命，因噎废食。右倾机会主义者抓住我们前进中的某些缺点，抓住我们已经克服和正在克服的缺点，甚至抓住我们不成其为缺点的缺点，又甚至抓住我们的成绩当缺点，来攻击我们，那是攻不倒我们的。
    克服右倾是当前的主要任务
    右倾机会主义者说：“中国是小资产阶级占人口大多数的国家，革命队伍里小资产阶级出身的人也很多，所以，小资产阶级狂热性最难纠正。他们的教条主义害死人。他们的‘左倾’冒险主义是党内的主要危险。”
    我们说，这不能一概而论。小资产阶级是个“处于资产阶级铁锤和无产阶级铁砧之间的阶级”（高尔基语）。在民主革命时期，他们身受帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义压迫，有强烈的民主革命的要求，但他们的世界观基本上是资产阶级个人主义、主观主义的世界观。他们参加革命以后，有人经过革命锻炼，把自己改造成了无产阶级的战士（这是多数），有人则表现出很大的动摇性（这是少数）。后面这一部分人当环境顺利时就容易狂热，犯“左倾”错误，但当碰到困难和挫折时，他们又容易悲观失望，犯右倾错误。如果一概而论，因为我们党里出身于小资产阶级的人多，就认为我们党似乎是个小资产阶级的党；因为有些小资产阶级的人曾经发过狂热，就认为他们只有“左倾”，我们只能反对“左倾”，这是对党的污蔑和对历史的歪曲。过去，我们党内曾经发生过几次“左倾”错误，但也发生过陈独秀主义等几次右倾的错误。其中也有人先“左”后右、一“左”一右地摇摆过。但是，我们党向来是实事求是的，有“左倾”反“左倾”，有右倾反右倾。无论“左倾”和右倾错误，党都纠正过来了，我们也因此取得了革命的经验，取得了革命的胜利。
    在整个过渡时期里主要的阶级斗争是无产阶级和资产阶级的斗争。现在，对资本主义所有制和小资产阶级个体所有制的社会主义改造已经基本上完成，但是，要资产阶级分子完全习惯于新社会的新制度还要经过相当长的时间，加之在世界上，资本主义还存在，所以资产阶级思想就会不时地冲击我们的队伍，在我们队伍里反映出来。而我们队伍里那些脱离群众、没有抛弃掉资产阶级个人主义的人，在这种和平建设的环境里，也容易滋长骄气、暮气，迷失方向，失去不断革命、积极进取的精神。有的人对右倾的危险警惕得不够，对右倾机会主义憎恨得不深，甚至还发生某些共鸣，他们在大是大非面前不是那么理直气壮，在工作里不是那么生龙活虎，总想“安居中游”。还有一些人则失去立场，变成了右倾机会主义者。在这种情况下，右倾机会主义也就成为革命事业中的主要危险。
    右倾机会主义的阶级根源，是资产阶级思想在我们党内的反映，而其思想根源，就是主观唯心主义的经验主义。他们的世界观、人生观和思想方法是唯我论、经验论，唯我独尊，自以为是，凭着自己主观、片面的感觉和经验来看问题，同贝克莱说的一样：“存在就是被知觉。”他们凭着知觉到的一点东西，抓住一点零碎、杂乱的表面现象和虚假的材料，以偏概全，以管窥豹，分不清也不愿意分清九个指头和一个指头的问题，分不清本质和现象、主流和支流、一般和个别、大局和小局、经常起作用的因素和临时起作用的因素；只要是对他那资产阶级个人主义和右倾机会主义有利的东西就是真理，就抓来当做法宝，拿来对抗党的总路线，反对人民的大跃进。他们的这种经验主义，乃是极端反动的主观唯心主义。他们利用过去历史上那些“左”倾冒险主义者的教条主义曾经造成很大危害这个事实，打着“反教条主义”的旗号，来推销修正主义的货色。但历史已经证明：教条主义固然害死人，经验主义也同样地害死人，特别是右倾机会主义者这种主观唯心主义的经验主义，其危害性更大。我们反对右倾机会主义，就是因为现在挡着我们去路的就是这种东西。我们前进一步，他们就叫嚣一顿。什么“小资产阶级狂热性最难纠正”、什么“教条主义害死人”、什么“‘左’倾是党内主要危害”，他们完全把话讲颠倒了！
    右倾机会主义者是我们的反面教员。他们越是积极推销他们那些右倾言论，进行右倾活动，我们就越能够把他们看清楚，同时也就越知道深自警惕。要警惕的至少有这几条：在大是大非面前不应当做中间派！在大跃进中不可能安居“中游”！在社会主义革命的大风雨中，必须彻底挖掉资产阶级个人主义、经验主义和任何保守、开倒车的思想！
    右倾机会主义者企图推翻总路线，反对大跃进，因此污蔑我们的大跃进是“小资产阶级的狂热性”，给我们泼冷水；我们就应当反其道而行之，要永远保持满腔热情，向前跃进，再跃进，朝着我们党的伟大领袖毛泽东同志指点的方向跃进，在总路线照耀下，把共产主义事业进行到底！
