Xinhua Daily News report: Taicang County's commercial departments in Jiangsu Province have recently taken the initiative to cooperate with and assist people's communes and production brigades in vigorously carrying out feed storage work, setting off a high tide of silage and dry storage feed production throughout the county.

In the past nine months or so, according to incomplete statistics, Taicang County has used more than 105 million jin of green substitute feed to feed pigs, effectively solving the feed problem for pigs. However, because most areas feed it as it is cut, lacking experience in silage and without the habit of storage, the feed for this winter and next spring has become a major problem. In order to help solve this practical problem, the County Commercial Bureau specifically convened a field meeting of deputy production leaders from communes, brigades, and supply and marketing cooperatives in Shuangfeng Commune, where silage and dry storage work had been done relatively well. Through the method of "seeing, learning, and debating," everyone recognized the advantages of silage feed: "good nutrition, fast growth, high income, labor saving, abundant resources, and simple storage." It can mobilize communes, brigades, households to do it big. At the meeting, the representatives decided to make a concentrated effort for ten days to store 2,000 jin of green feed for each pig; fight hard in the fourth quarter to complete the silage and dry storage of 330 million jin of feed.

After the meeting, in just nine days, the county mobilized 115,600 person-times, opened 3,708 cellars, prepared more than 7,900 storage jars, and stored more than 50 million jin of green feed and more than 1.2 million jin of dry feed.

Now, Taicang County is launching a "five clean" (scoop up all the aquatic plants in the river, cut all the weeds on the ground, pick all the leaves on the trees, collect all the vines and stems in the fields, and pick up all the cattle and horse manure) and "six compare" (compare determination, compare vigor, compare mobilization of the masses, compare silage and dry storage, compare green substitute feed varieties, compare feed planting, management, harvesting, and use) red flag competition to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of feed storage tasks and ensure the great development of pig production this winter and next spring.

    给冬季发展养猪备好饲料
    太仓县社社做好饲料贮藏工作
    九天时间已突击贮藏、干藏五千多万斤
    据新华日报消息　江苏省太仓县商业部门最近主动地配合和帮助人民公社、生产大队大搞饲料贮藏工作，在全县范围内掀起了青贮、干藏饲料的生产高潮。
    九个多月来，据不完全统计，太仓县已用了一亿零五百多万斤青代饲料喂猪，有力地解决了生猪的饲料问题。但是由于多数地区是现割现喂，缺少青贮的经验和没有贮藏的习惯，因此今冬明春的饲料成为很大的问题。县商业局为帮助解决这一实际问题，特在青贮、干藏工作搞得比较好的双凤公社召开了公社、大队、供销部的副业生产负责人现场会议，通过“看、学、辩”的办法，使大家认识到青贮饲料有“营养好、长肉快、收入多、省人工、资源多、贮藏简单”的优点，可以发动社社、队队、户户大搞特搞。会上，到会代表决定突击一旬，为每头生猪贮藏青饲料两千斤；大战四季度，完成青贮、干藏饲料三亿三千万斤。
    会后，仅九天时间，全县就出动了十一万五千六百多人次，开地窖三千七百零八个，准备贮藏缸七千九百多口，贮藏了青饲料五千多万斤，干藏一百二十多万斤。
    现在，太仓全县正在开展一个“五光”（河里水草捞光，地上野草割光，树上树叶采光，田里藤茎收光，牛马粪拾光）、“六比”（比决心大，比干劲足，比发动群众多，比青贮干藏多，比青代饲料品种多，比饲料种得多、管得好、收得多、用得好）的红旗竞赛运动，保证完成和超额完成饲料贮藏任务，确保今冬明春生猪生产大发展。
