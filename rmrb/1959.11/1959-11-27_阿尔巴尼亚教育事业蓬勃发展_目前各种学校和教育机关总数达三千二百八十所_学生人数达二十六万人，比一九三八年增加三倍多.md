Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 25th. In the short fifteen years since the people took power, Albania's education has made brilliant achievements. According to statistics, in this country, once the most culturally backward in Europe, an average of less than six residents now are studying. This far exceeds the level of its neighboring countries Turkey, Italy and Yugoslavia.

Since liberation, Albania's education has developed rapidly. Currently, the total number of various schools and educational institutions in the country has reached 3,280, nearly four times more than in 1938 before liberation. The total number of students nationwide has reached 260,000, 3.7 times more than in 1938. In 1938, there were only 1,600 teachers in the country, but now there are 10,000, an increase of more than five times.

Before liberation, more than 80% of Albania's population was illiterate. Two-thirds of school-age children could not attend school. However, fifteen years later, Albania has not only eliminated illiteracy among people under the age of forty, but has also implemented a seven-year compulsory education system nationwide. Currently, the number of primary schools has increased nearly threefold compared to 1938, and the number of seven-year schools has increased from eleven to 493, an increase of 44 times. There are now 56 middle schools.

What the Albanian people are proud of is that in the era of the people's power, institutions of higher learning that had never existed in Albanian history have been established: the Tirana State University with six departments and eighteen majors, two normal schools, an agricultural college, a two-year advanced drama school, etc. Currently, there are more than 5,000 university students, which is more than twice the number of middle school students in 1938.

One of the great achievements of Albania's education is that schools have opened their doors to the children of the broad masses of farmers and women. In the past, most of the schools were concentrated in the cities, and the children of farmers had few opportunities to go to school. But now, out of the 2,275 primary schools in the country, 2,129 are located in rural areas. Among the more than 170,000 primary school students nationwide, 120,000 are the children of farmers. In addition, 73% of the seven-year schools are also located in the vast rural areas. Women have also stepped into the gates of schools after liberation. Currently, the number of female primary school students nationwide has increased fourfold compared to before liberation, and the number of female middle school students has increased ninefold.

At the same time, the People's Government has established a large number of night schools and correspondence schools so that workers and cadres can study without leaving production. Currently, more than 26,000 workers are studying in night schools.

In the past fifteen years, Albania has trained more than 3,500 senior professionals in various fields and more than 15,000 intermediate technicians. For the first time, Albania has its own engineers, agronomists, and doctors, etc.

In order to accelerate socialist construction and cultivate cadres who are both virtuous and talented, who understand both their profession and love labor, in 1958 the Albanian Labor Party put forward the educational policy of "combining theory and practice, education and life." Now, Albania has various vocational and technical schools such as agriculture, veterinary medicine, petroleum, construction, and medicine that are closely integrated with industrial and agricultural production. At the same time, students in ordinary middle schools participate in half a month of voluntary labor every year, and also go to rural areas for labor during the summer vacation. The school also strengthened the basic courses of technical education and production practice. (Attached picture)

    阿尔巴尼亚教育事业蓬勃发展
    目前各种学校和教育机关总数达三千二百八十所  学生人数达二十六万人，比一九三八年增加三倍多
    新华社地拉那25日电　在人民掌握政权后的短短十五年中，阿尔巴尼亚的教育事业取得了光辉的成就。根据统计材料，这个过去曾是欧洲文化最落后的国家，今天平均不到六个居民中就有一人在学习。这大大超过了和它邻近的国家土耳其、意大利和南斯拉夫的水平。
    解放以来，阿尔巴尼亚的教育事业以飞快的速度向前发展。目前，全国各种学校和教育机关的总数已经达到三千二百八十所，比解放前1938年增加了近四倍，全国学生总数已经达到二十六万人，比1938年增加了三点七倍。1938年全国总共才有一千六百名教师，而现在已经达到一万名，即增加了五倍多。
    解放前，阿尔巴尼亚全国80％以上的人口都是文盲。全国三分之二的学龄儿童进不了学校。但是，十五年后的今天，阿尔巴尼亚不仅消灭了四十岁以下的文盲，而且已在全国实行了七年制义务教育。目前，小学校比1938年增加了近三倍，七年制学校从过去的十一所增加到了四百九十三所，即增加了四十四倍；中学已有五十六所。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民引为自豪的是，在人民政权年代中建立了阿尔巴尼亚历史上从来没有过的高等学校：一所拥有六个系和十八个专业的地拉那国立大学、两所师范专科学校、一所农学院、一所二年制的高级戏剧学校等。目前，大学生共达五千多人，这比1938年的中学生人数还多两倍。
    阿尔巴尼亚教育事业的巨大成就之一是：学校为广大农民子弟和妇女敞开了大门。过去的学校大半集中在城市，农民的子弟很少有上学的机会。但现在全国二千二百七十五所小学中，就有二千一百二十九所设在农村。在全国十七万多名小学生中，有十二万是农民的子弟。此外，73％的七年制学校也都设在广大农村。妇女在解放后也跨进了学校的大门。目前，全国小学校的女生已比解放前增加了四倍，中学女生增多了九倍。
    同时，人民政府大量兴办了夜校和函授学校，使工人和干部可以不脱离生产进行学习。现在，在夜校中学习的工人就有二万六千多人。
    十五年来，阿尔巴尼亚已培养出三千五百多名各种专业的高级人才和一万五千多名中级技术人员。阿尔巴尼亚第一次有了自己的工程师、农艺师和医生等。
    为了加速社会主义建设和培养德才兼备的、既懂专业又爱劳动的干部，1958年阿尔巴尼亚劳动党提出了“理论和实践、教育和生活相结合”的教育方针。现在，阿尔巴尼亚有着与工农业生产紧密结合的农业、兽医、石油、建筑、医学等各种专业技术学校，同时，普通中学的学生每年都要参加半个月的义务劳动，在暑期还要到农村劳动。学校中还充实了技术教育的基础课程和生产实习。（附图片）
