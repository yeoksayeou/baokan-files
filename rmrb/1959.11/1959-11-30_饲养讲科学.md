Editor's Note:

    Scientific Breeding

    In six years, the Jiangzhuang Production Team increased its draught cattle from five (including only three female animals) to thirty-three. Thirty-three is a small number in absolute terms; but the growth rate is truly astonishing. The achievements of the Jiangzhuang Production Team are a great encouragement to people. It shows that as long as the correct policy of self-breeding and self-raising is earnestly implemented, and the feeding and management work is effectively carried out, the number of draught animals can be increased from a few to dozens; and units with more draught animals can grow from dozens to hundreds, or even thousands.

    In self-breeding and self-raising, the management and feeding work of the Jiangzhuang team is particularly outstanding. Those veteran breeders truly regard the calves as their own treasures and take care of them meticulously. It is this spirit of high responsibility for public property that has enabled them to create very scientific feeding and management methods. They have a set of experiences worth promoting in terms of how to match the use of draught animals, how to allocate feed in troughs, how to match different types of fodder, and how to manage environmental hygiene. Although other places also have a lot of experience in the feeding and management of draught animals, they are mostly a mix of large and small animals. The characteristic of the Jiangzhuang team is that it is both meticulous and complete, so their feeding and management methods are very reasonable. This is where our purpose lies in recommending the experience of Jiangzhuang to everyone.

    饲养讲科学
    蒋庄生产队六年之中耕牛由五头（其中只三头母畜）增加到三十三头。三十三头，从绝对数字看是很小的；但从增长速度上看，却着实惊人。蒋庄生产队的成就给人们莫大的鼓励，它说明：只要认真贯彻自繁自育的正确方针，切实做好饲养管理工作，就可以使耕畜由几头发展到几十头；而原来耕畜较多的单位，更可以从几十头发展到几百头，甚至上千头。
    在自繁自育中间，蒋庄队的管理饲养工作特别突出。那些老饲养员把小牛犊真正当成自己的宝贝看待，照顾得无微不至。正是这种对公共财产高度负责的精神，又使得他们创造出很科学的饲养管理方法。在使役上怎样配套，喂养上怎样配槽，饲草种类怎样搭配，环境卫生怎样管理，他们都有一套值得推广的经验。别的地方对耕畜的饲养管理虽然也有不少经验，但都是大小畜搭配。蒋庄队的特点却是既细致又完整，因而他们的饲养管理办法很合理。我们向大家推荐蒋庄的经验的目的也在这些地方。
