    Collaboration is Strength

    The large-scale collaboration among factories and enterprises in Shanghai has generated tremendous strength. Many factories and enterprises that previously had difficulty completing their plans have completed them quickly, efficiently, and economically through collaboration. This shows that extensively and deeply carrying out large-scale collaboration is an important method to ensure continued leap forward and joint leap forward, and a guarantee for completing the national plan ahead of schedule.

    Collaboration between enterprises is a characteristic of socialist enterprise relations. The various enterprises of the national economy are inextricably linked. No unit can do without the coordination and support of other units. If one unit falls behind, it will hold back many other units. In order to ensure the early completion of the entire national plan, we should strive to "not let a fraternal factory fall behind," working together and leaping forward jointly. In the year of continued leap forward, the collaborative relationships between industries have developed in both content and form. The aspects of support are increasing, and the scope of collaboration is widening. Many enterprises in Shanghai, under the unified leadership of the Party, have formed collaborative networks with horizontal connections, vertical linkages, making the collaboration more organized, more regular, and more powerful. Collaboration is not a temporary task, nor is it just the responsibility of a few units, but a regular task and a shared responsibility. Only by strengthening the leadership of collaborative work, organizing the power of collaboration, and fully mobilizing the positive factors of each factory can we support each other and leap forward jointly.

    Collaboration is strength. As the annual plan approaches completion, it is even more necessary to work together and strive jointly to complete the national plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

    协作就是力量
    上海工厂企业的大协作，产生了巨大的力量，许多原来完成计划有困难的工厂企业，通过协作多快好省地完成了计划。这说明广泛深入地开展大协作，是保证继续跃进、共同跃进的重要方法，是提前完成国家计划的一项保证。
    企业之间的协作，是社会主义企业关系的特征。国民经济各企业之间都有着不可分割的联系。任何一个单位都离不开别的单位的配合和支援。一个单位落后了，就要拖很多单位的后腿。为了保证整个国家计划的提前完成，我们就应该努力作到“不让一个兄弟厂掉队”，同心协力，共同跃进。在继续跃进的一年间，行行业业的协作关系，无论从内容到形式，都有了发展。支援的方面越来越多，协作的范围越来越广。上海许多企业在党的统一领导下左右连串、上下挂钩组成协作网，使协作更有组织、更经常、更有力量。协作，不是临时的任务，也不只是几个单位的责任，而是经常的任务、共同的责任。只有加强对协作工作的领导，把协作的力量组织起来，把每个厂的积极因素都充分发挥出来，才能互相支援，共同跃进。
    协作就是力量。当年度计划接近完成的时候，更需要同心协力，为提前超额完成国家计划而共同奋斗。
