"Everything for a Greater Leap Forward in the Motherland"
    ——Notes on People Serving the National Conference of Heroes
　　By Our Correspondent

    As more than six thousand vanguards of the Great Leap Forward sounded the horn for continued leap forward in the Great Hall of the People in the capital, tens of thousands of service personnel inside and outside the conference venue were also working day and night for this conference. Whether they were conference affairs personnel, service staff, printing workers, communicators, car drivers, cooks, telephone operators, writers who came to the conference to interview, or artists performing for the representatives, everyone was full of energy and soaring enthusiasm. They tried every possible means to do more for the conference, and their common belief was: contributing a little more to the Conference of Heroes is contributing to a greater leap forward in the motherland!

    The documents of the National Conference of Heroes recorded the bold words of heroes from all walks of life, and these most beautiful poems inspired people to march towards new milestones. When the task of printing all the conference documents was assigned to the "Workers' Daily" printing factory, more than three hundred employees were extremely excited. They guaranteed: "Print whatever the conference wants to print; print as much as it wants to print; print as fast as it wants to print!" This conference required a lot of documents to be printed. Each speech alone needed to be printed 10,000 copies, and many speeches were finalized the night before and needed to be printed the next morning. To this end, the factory, from the director to the workers, launched a day and night blitz, and various work processes launched fierce competition and close cooperation. Shan Delu, a plate-making worker in the printing workshop, upon hearing the news of printing the conference documents, carried his luggage to the workshop and said to his wife: "I must complete the task excellently before I go home." From the 25th to the 27th, the factory workers had quickly printed more than 500,000 words, more than 900,000 copies, and 151 kinds of conference documents without a single mistake.

    Arriving behind the rostrum of the Great Hall of the People, you are immediately plunged into a tense and solemn battle environment: the conference affairs team is arranging the agenda; the translators are quickly translating the speeches into five ethnic languages and transmitting them to the "interpretive breeze" through the broadcaster; the recorders are checking the shorthand drafts against the recordings; the sound engineers are constantly checking and adjusting the volume of the amplifiers... The dozens of staff members in charge of conference affairs demonstrated tenacious labor and outstanding organizational skills. Since the Great Hall of the People was holding other meetings in the days before the conference, the arrangement work of this Conference of Heroes was completed in a short period of two or three days. The workers of the Beijing Timber Factory worked hard for two days and nights to rush to make the "flower box" in front of the rostrum and completed the task. The "platform" tables and chairs used by the members of the presidium on the conference rostrum were pieced together from more than 1,000 "parts." Each "part" was carried by two strong young men who were sweating profusely. In the past, it took 120 people 24 hours to build it. This time, in order to save time, the conference staff, with the assistance of workers from a factory of the People's Liberation Army and the Beijing Timber Factory, improved the installation method. One hundred and ten people only took eight hours to erect a magnificent "platform" on the rostrum. More than 100 female service staff members of the Great Hall of the People proposed: the more tense the conference, the more the sanitation work must keep up. They often cleaned the venue late at night after the meeting, and got up early the next morning to clean again, so that the venue where more than 10,000 people were meeting was often kept bright and clean, and the air was fresh.

    The enthusiastic hospitality and meticulous care of the hotel service staff impressed many representatives. It was already past 2:00 a.m. when the representatives from Sichuan and other provinces who had just gotten off the train arrived at the Xijiao Hotel. The manager and staff all put on newly ironed snow-white uniforms and lined up at the door to welcome them. As soon as the representatives walked into the dining hall, they smelled the aroma of their hometown cuisine. The service staff said that the representatives are models among models, heroes among heroes, and they must ensure that they eat well, live well, and have a good meeting. They treated the representatives even more kindly than their own relatives. On the 25th, a cold air mass moved south, and the weather in Beijing suddenly turned cold. The staff, fearing that the representatives from the south would catch a cold, immediately borrowed quilts, added blankets, and contacted the department store to purchase many cotton-padded jackets, sweaters, and wool sweaters, so that the representatives felt at home in the hotel. For the convenience of the representatives, sales departments were added inside and outside the hotel building, with books, pictorials, daily necessities, medicines, etc., all available. Late at night, the hotel was quiet, and the representatives were all asleep. The service staff tiptoed through the rooms, carefully covering the representatives with quilts. The day dawned again, and the pleasant morning music gently woke up the representatives, and the broadcaster conveyed the service staff's forecast of the cold and warm weather. The heroes began a new day's work with the deep care of the service staff.

    According to the customs of northerners, dumplings must be eaten during festive occasions. The cooks in the North District of Xiyi Hotel launched a competition to celebrate the opening of the Conference of Heroes by serving dumplings to more than 800 representatives. Eight hundred people, with an average of forty dumplings per person, requires more than 32,000 dumplings. They had never made so many before. What to do? Still, let's muster up our energy and strive for the top. After lunch on the 25th, the entire kitchen was boiling. The director of the North District Management Department personally took command, and more than 40 cooks, living room and restaurant service staff all started working together. Everyone wrapped faster and better, and in less than five hours, more than 40,000 dumplings were wrapped. When the cooks saw the representatives eating the dumplings, everyone smiled happily.

    On the evening of the 26th, the representatives from the border areas and various ethnic groups of the motherland returned from attending the opening ceremony of the conference. As soon as they entered the restaurant, the service staff of the Qianmen Hotel immediately brought a large plate of "Eight Treasure Rice" to each table, with the words "Congratulations on the Victorious Opening of the Conference of Heroes" "written" in bright red letters with cream. When the representatives learned that this was a special gift made by the cooks for them, warm applause broke out in the four restaurants at the same time. All the staff of the Qianmen Hotel also proposed: each person should do a good deed for the representatives every day. Chen Guoxia, a representative from Guizhou, was disabled with a leg burn after rescuing state property from a fire. When she went to the meeting every day, the waiter Tian Yulin carried her from the room to the car, and when she returned from the meeting, he carried her from the car back to the room. He also delivered three meals a day to her room. Sun Guangji, a representative of the Qinghai delegation, wrote a poem praising the working spirit of the service staff: "Your enthusiasm is as high as the 'Sun and Moon Mountain' in Qinghai, and your deep affection is like that of Qinghai Lake."

    The more than 300 drivers of the Capital Motor Company tried their best to save the representatives' time, making their rides fast, comfortable, and safe. Whenever the conference ended, more than 300 cars in front of the Great Hall of the People started simultaneously, and in just over ten minutes, all of the more than 6,000 representatives got into the cars. During the drive, the cars were driven fast and steadily. In a few days, they received more than 180 letters of commendation from the representatives. Yu Jufu, an old driver who was often beaten and scolded in the old society, felt great honor this time to be responsible for picking up and dropping off the Fuxin delegation from Liaoning Province. To express his love for the representatives, he brought his favorite set of old teapots from home to the car, brewed hot tea for the representatives to drink, and bought many local newspapers and periodicals from Liaoning Province and put them in the car for the representatives to read news from their hometown.

    Communication work is also an important part of the conference work. The 13 communicators of the conference send an average of one or two thousand letters and materials every day. When they are busiest, they cannot fit in their briefcases, so they use sacks; if one person cannot send them all, they have to use a car to pull them. Thousands of telegrams and congratulatory letters reporting good news flew from all over the country to the capital. Telegraph operators and mail carriers all regard being able to transmit these good tidings for the conference as their greatest glory. On the 25th, which was a Sunday, comrades from the Fuxingmen Post and Telecommunications Bureau heard that there were many congratulatory telegrams sent to the Conference of Heroes from all over the country, and the on-duty deciphering clerks were too busy, so they voluntarily gave up their holiday rest to support the work of the deciphering clerks. Bureau Chief Li Wenpu also came to help, and he and three other staff members deciphered more than 12,400 words in three hours. Many representatives wrote letters or sent telegrams back to encourage their companions to continue the leap forward. Every word in these telegrams and letters is a note of the Great Leap Forward symphony, which excites every telegraph operator and mail carrier, and spreads to all parts of the country through them, adding endless motivation to the soldiers of production and construction!

    “一切为了祖国更大的跃进”
    ——记为全国群英会服务的人们
　　本报记者
    当六千多名大跃进的尖兵在首都人民大会堂吹响了继续跃进的号角时，群英会会场内外数以万计的服务人员也在夜以继日地为这次大会忙碌着。不论是会务人员、服务员、印刷工人、通讯员、汽车司机、炊事员、电话员，或是到大会采访的作家、为代表演出的艺术家，个个精神饱满，干劲冲天。他们千方百计地争取为大会多作一些事，他们的共同信念是：为群英大会多贡献出一份力量，就是为了祖国更大的跃进！
    全国群英会的文件记下了各路英雄的豪言壮语，这些最美丽的诗篇鼓舞着人们奔向新的里程。当承印大会全部文件的任务下达到“工人日报”印刷厂以后，三百多职工异常振奋，他们保证：“大会要印什么就印什么；要印多少就印多少；要印多快就印多快！”这次大会需要印刷的文件很多，仅每个发言稿就要各印一万份，而且许多发言稿往往头一天晚上定稿，第二天上午就要印出来。为此，这个厂从厂长到工人日夜不停地展开了突击战斗，各工序展开了火热的竞赛和亲密的协作。制印车间拼版工人山德禄听到承印大会文件的消息，背起行李就到车间去，对他的爱人说：“我一定要出色地完成任务以后才回家。”从25日到27日，这个厂的工人们已经快速印完了五十多万字、九十多万份、一百五十一种大会文件，没有出一处差错。
    来到人民大会堂的主席台后面，你立刻就被卷入一个紧张严肃的战斗环境中：会务组的人员去安排议程；翻译们迅速地把发言稿译成五个民族的语言，通过播音器传送到“意译风”中去；记录正在根据录音机核对速记草稿；音响工人不时在检查、调整扩音器的音量……。担任会务工作的几十名工作人员表现了顽强的劳动和出色的组织才能。由于这次大会开会前几天，人民大会堂正举行着别的会议，这次群英会会场的布置工作是在两三天的短时间中突击完成的。北京木材厂的职工为了赶制主席台前“花盒子”苦战了两天两夜完成了任务。大会主席台上主席团人员用的“台坪”桌凳，是一千多块“零件”拼起来的，每块“零件”由两个棒小伙子抬着还汗流满面，过去一百二十个人要二十四小时才能搭成，这次为了赶时间，大会工作人员在解放军某厂、北京木材厂的工人协助之下，改进了安装方法，一百一十个人只用八个多小时，一个宏伟的“台坪”就树立在主席台上了。人民大会堂的一百多名女服务员提出：大会越紧张，卫生工作越要跟上。她们常常在散会后打扫会场到深夜，第二天清早又起来打扫，使一万多人开会的会场，经常保持着窗明几净，空气清新。
    旅馆服务员们热情的招待和无微不至的体贴，使许多代表感激不已。已经是清晨两点多了，刚刚下火车的四川等省代表才抵达西郊宾馆。经理、职工们全都穿起新熨好的雪白制服列队在门口欢迎。代表们一走进饭厅就闻到了家乡的饭菜香味。服务员们说，代表们是模范里的模范、英雄里的英雄，一定要保证他们吃好、住好、开好会。他们对代表比待自己的亲人还亲。25日冷空气南下，北京天气骤寒，职工怕来自南方的代表们凉着，马上借被子、加铺毛毯，并且从百货公司接洽购买了许多棉袄、绒衫和毛衣，使代表们在旅馆就像在家里一样。为了使代表方便，旅馆大楼内外增设了销售部，图书、画报、日用百货、药品等应有尽有。深夜，宾馆里一片宁静，代表们都睡着了，服务员轻手轻脚地巡视在各个房间，细心的替代表们把被子盖好。天又亮了，悦耳的晨曲把代表们轻轻唤醒，广播器里传出了服务员预告天气寒暖的声音。英雄们带着服务员深厚的关怀，开始了新的一天的工作。
    按照北方人的习惯，每逢喜庆就要吃饺子。西颐宾馆北区的炊事员为了庆祝群英会开幕，请八百多代表吃饺子而展开了竞赛。八百人，每人平均四十个饺子，就要三万二千多个，从来也没包过这样多。怎么办？还是鼓足干劲，力争上游吧。25日午饭过后，整个厨房就沸腾起来。北区管理部主任亲自挂帅，炊事员、客厅和餐厅的服务员四十多人一齐动手，大家越包越快，越包越好，不到五个小时，四万多个饺子就包出来了。当炊事员们看到代表们把饺子吃到嘴里时，个个乐得眉开眼笑。
    26日晚，来自祖国边疆和各个兄弟民族代表参加大会开幕式回来，一进餐厅，前门饭店的服务员立刻给每桌上送来了一大盘用奶油“写”着“祝贺群英会胜利开幕”几个鲜艳红字的“八宝饭”，当代表们知道这是炊事员们为他们特制的礼品时，四个餐厅同时发出了热烈的掌声。前门饭店的全体职工还提出：每人每天要为代表做一件好事。贵州代表陈国霞因为从烈火中抢救国家财产一条腿烧伤残废了。每天去开会时服务员田玉林就把她从房间里背到汽车上，开会回来时再由汽车上把她背到房间里。一日三餐也都给她送到寝室里去。青海代表团代表孙广基写了一首诗赞美服务员的工作精神道：“你们的干劲高似青海‘日月山’，待人情深好似那青海湖”。
    首都汽车公司的三百多司机为了节省代表时间，想尽办法使他们坐起车来又迅速、又舒适、又安全。每当大会散会时，人民大会堂前三百多辆汽车立刻同时发动起来，只用十多分钟六千多位代表就全部上了汽车。行车中，车子开的又快又稳。几天当中他们收到了代表们写的一百八十多封表扬信。在旧社会经常挨打受骂的老司机虞聚富，这次负责接送辽宁省阜新代表团，他感到莫大的光荣。为了表达他对代表们的热爱，他把自己最心爱的一套古老的茶壶从家中带到车上，沏上热茶给代表们喝，还买了许多辽宁省的地方报刊放在车上，让代表们看看家乡的消息。
    通讯工作也是大会工作的一个重要组成部分。大会的十三名通讯员每天平均要送出一两千封信件、资料等。最忙时皮包里放不下，就用麻袋装；一个人送不了，只好用车拉。千万件报捷的电报、贺信从全国各地飞向首都。电报员、邮递员都把能够为大会传递这些喜讯看成是自己最大的光荣。25日是个星期天，复兴门邮电局的同志听说各地给群英会拍来的祝贺电报很多，值班译电员忙不过来，就自动放弃假日的休息，支援译电员工作。局长李文璞也来帮忙，他和另外三个工作人员三个钟头就译出了一万二千四百多个字。许多代表写信或打电报回去鼓舞同伴们继续跃进。这些电报、信件中的每一个字都是大跃进交响曲的音符，它激动着每一个电报员、投递员，并且通过他们传播到全国各地，给生产建设的战士们增添了无穷的动力！
