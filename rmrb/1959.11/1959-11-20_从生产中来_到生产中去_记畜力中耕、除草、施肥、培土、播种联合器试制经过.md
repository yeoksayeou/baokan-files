From Production, To Production
    ——On the Trial Production of an Animal-Powered Combined Cultivating, Weeding, Fertilizing, Hilling, and Seeding Machine
    By Our Correspondent Yin Ping
    At the Hubei Province Ten-Year Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition, a light and flexible animal-powered combined cultivating, weeding, fertilizing, hilling, and seeding machine deeply attracted the visiting audience, especially some farmers and farm workers from the countryside, who were even more interested. They were surprised and excited that it could perform four or more operations simultaneously, believing that this would be very enlightening for rural tool reform.
    This combined machine, from its appearance, is very simple, mostly made of wood. However, in the farmland, it can exert great power, combining the operations that people have long performed manually in successive steps. People can easily and freely operate the combined machine in the fields, no longer bending over to engage in heavy physical labor. One person can cultivate, weed, fertilize, hill, or sow twenty mu of land a day, with good quality.
    This new type of agricultural implement was created by Chen Runfang, a young teacher from the Agricultural Machinery Department of Huazhong Agricultural College, in close cooperation with students, workers, and farmers. Its birth once again illustrates the victory of the Party's education policy and the policy of scientific research serving production, and that intellectuals must integrate with workers and peasants to achieve something. In early April of this year, Chen Runfang and others began to accept the task of researching and trial-producing an agricultural implement to replace manual labor for four operations. This was not an easy task for a young teaching assistant engaged in scientific research work for the first time. At first, he simply didn't know how to start. After thinking about it, he still only thought of doing it according to the old methods of his teachers. So, he spent all day in the library, turning over all kinds of Chinese and foreign materials, but did not find a similar agricultural implement as he had imagined. He felt very distressed and began to doubt his approach. At this time, he went to the Party branch, and the Party promptly told him: Proceed from the actual situation of production, go to production, go to the masses, and humbly listen to the opinions of workers and farmers, and you will find a way. The Party's instructions quickly clarified his thinking and changed his original approach. First, he requested to be sent down to the agricultural machinery factory on campus to work with the workers and solicit their opinions on the trial production of the combined machine. At the same time, he took the time to visit and hold discussions at the farm on campus, listening to the technical requirements of the old farm workers for making such an agricultural implement. In addition, he widely collected and analyzed the information on the reform of agricultural implements by the peasant masses in Hubei Province since the Great Leap Forward, and repeatedly discussed with the workers of the mechanical factory. Gradually, his thinking became clearer and clearer. He decided to further carry out research and trial production work on the basis of summarizing the masses' experience in tool reform. In this way, he found design materials and research topics from the rich production practice. Soon, they chose the wooden cultivating and weeding machine created by Deng Changsheng, a farmer from Tianmen County, Hubei Province, as the foundation, improved its imperfections, and designed, together with the students, a tool drawing with cultivating, weeding, fertilizing, and hilling settings.
    After the initial drawings were designed, Chen Runfang and others immediately devoted themselves to the intense trial production work. Every day, from morning to night, they participated in the specific manufacturing process with the workers. If they didn't understand something, they humbly learned from the workers; if there were not enough materials, they found waste materials to replace them; if they encountered problems in production, everyone studied together to solve them. When making the seed metering device for sowing, it was always not done well. Either the size of the holes was not suitable, or the position was not appropriate. Dozens of consecutive trials failed. At this time, Chen Runfang and the workers could not eat or sleep well. One day, Chen Runfang returned to his room late at night, but he still did not want to rest. He carefully flipped through the information on the reform of sowing tools by farmers and found that he had to calculate the seeding rate. He calculated alone in the room all night. Early in the morning, he immediately ran to discuss it with the workers, and finally found a solution, making a seed metering device that could sow all kinds of seeds, so that the first combined machine was quickly made.
    After the first combined machine was made, they also broke the previous practice and decided to take it to production and to the masses, so that it could be improved and enhanced with the help of the masses. At this time, it happened that the farm on campus needed a seeder to rush-sow sesame. With the support of the Party organization of the farm, they took it to the Sixth Production Team to start sowing experiments, and sowed twenty mu of land in eight hours; while in the past, using manual sowing, one person could only sow half a mu of land. Three days later, the sesame seedlings grew out, growing very evenly and neatly. According to the production experiment, the workers put forward suggestions for improvement. Soon, they took the improved combined machine to the cotton fields of the Nanhu Farm for joint operation experiments. The experiment proved that the combined machine could perform four operations simultaneously, and the fertilizer was evenly spread. However, it was also found that it still had many shortcomings, such as in cotton fields where the cultivated soil layer was very hardened, the ploughed soil became large chunks, which caused the phenomenon of crushing seedlings; the strength of the shovel handle used for cultivating was also not enough, and it was easy to bend. According to these problems and the opinions of the farm workers, they added a multi-tooth soil cutting rake to enhance the strength of the shovel handle. In the modification, they continued to take it to the farm on campus for experiments, listening to the opinions of the masses at any time. Finally, the places where the handrail and adjusting machinery were not flexible, and even the entire machine, were researched and improved one by one. In July, Chen Runfang and fitter Gao Yurui carried the combined machine to the Xiaomiao Commune in Tianmen County, and repeatedly experimented and researched with the commune members, commune cadres, and commune factory workers, listened to the opinions of the farmers, and then modified it. With the help of the workers and peasant masses, after more than twenty repeated improvements, the combined machine was gradually improved and made applicable.
    After the successful trial production of the combined machine, it was immediately welcomed by relevant units. Many communes in Tianmen County have asked for the faster production of this agricultural implement, so that it can be put into production more quickly. The Hubei Provincial Science and Technology Commission and relevant units made a very cautious assessment, affirming that the basic trial production of the combined machine was successful, the work efficiency was more than fifteen times higher than manual operation, and the quality of joint operation was higher than manual operation, which could ensure that the countryside could achieve intensive cultivation with less labor. At the same time, it was decided to first conduct experiments in some areas, and then promote and apply it throughout the province.
    A few days ago, the reporter visited Comrade Chen Runfang, who participated in the production, at Huazhong Agricultural College. This young teacher said excitedly: "This is my first time engaging in scientific research, but it is also a good start. I am like a child learning to walk, and I have found the right direction. I have made it clear that scientific research is closely integrated with production practice, and that coming from production and going to production can quickly achieve results. I, an intellectual, cannot achieve such results without leaving the workers and peasants. This participation in the research and trial production work has taught me many things and enriched and improved myself."

    从生产中来  到生产中去
    ——记畜力中耕、除草、施肥、培土、播种联合器试制经过
    本报记者　殷平
    在湖北省十年经济文化建设成就展览会上，有一部轻便、灵活的畜力中耕、除草、施肥、培土、播种联合器，深深地吸引着参观的观众，特别是一些来自农村的农民和农场工人，更加感到兴趣。他们对它能够同时进行四种以上作业，感到惊喜和兴奋，认为这对农村工具改革会有很大的启示作用。
    这部联合器，从外形看去，十分简单，绝大部分是用木料制成的。可是，在农田中，它却能发挥很大的威力，把人们长期以来要逐道工序进行人工劳动的作业，联在一起了。人们可以轻松自如地操纵着联合器行驶在田间，不必再弯腰驼背地进行繁重的体力劳动，一个人一天能耕作、除草、施肥、培土或播种二十亩地，质量也很好。
    这部新式农具，是华中农学院农业机械系青年教师陈润芳和学生、工人、农民紧密结合制作出来的。它的诞生又一次说明，党的教育方针和科学研究为生产服务的方针的胜利，知识分子必须和工农结合才能有所作为。今年4月初，陈润芳等开始接受了研究试制一种农具代替人力操作四种作业劳动的课题。这对第一次从事科学研究工作的青年助教来说，不是一件容易的事。开初，他简直不知如何下手，想来想去，还是只想到按照自己老师们的老办法做。于是，他整天钻在图书室，翻遍了中外古今的资料，但是并没有找到想像中类似的农具，心里感到十分苦恼，也开始对自己的做法产生了怀疑。这时，他去找了党支部，党及时告诉他：从生产实际出发，到生产中去，到群众中去，虚心听取工人、农民的意见，会找到办法的。党的指示使他很快就明确起来，改变了原来的做法。首先，他要求下放到了校内的农业机械工厂，和工人一起劳动，征求他们对试制联合器的意见。同时，他又抽出时间到校内农场进行访问和座谈，听取了农场老工人们对作这种农具的技术要求。另外，他还广泛收集和分析了湖北省大跃进以来农民群众改革农具的资料，又反复地和机械工厂的工人们商量。渐渐地，他的思想越来越明确了，决定在总结群众工具改革经验的基础上，进一步进行研究、试制工作。这样，他就从丰富的生产实际中找到设计资料，找到了研究课题。很快地，他们就选择了湖北天门县农民邓昌盛创制的木质中耕除草器作为基础，改进了它不完善的地方，和学生们一起设计了一种既有中耕、除草，又有施肥、培土设置的工具图纸。
    初步的图样设计出来以后，陈润芳等立即投入了紧张的试制工作。每天，从早到晚，他们都和工人们一起参加具体的制作工艺。不懂的，就虚心向工人学习；材料不够，就找废料代替；遇到生产中的难题，就大家一起研究解决。在制作供播种用的排种器时，总是作不好，不是孔眼大小不合适，就是位置不恰当，连续试作了几十次都失败了。这时候，陈润芳和工人们弄得饭也吃不下，觉也睡不好。有一天，陈润芳回到住的房间已经是深夜了，他仍然不想休息，仔细地翻有关农民改革播种工具的资料，发现必须计算排种量的问题。他一人在房间计算了一夜。一清早，他立即跑去和工人们商量，终于找到了解决的办法，制成了能播种各种种子的排种器，使第一部联合器很快地就制作出来。
    第一部联合器制作出来以后，他们也打破以往的做法，决定拿到生产中、群众中去，让它在群众帮助下改进、提高。这时候，恰逢校内农场正需要播种器抢播芝麻。在农场党组织支持下，他们把它拿到了第六生产队里开始试验播种，八小时内就播种了二十亩地；而往常用人工播种，一人只能播种半亩地。三天以后，芝麻苗长出来了，长得十分均匀、整齐。根据生产试验的情况，工人们提出了改进的意见。不久，他们又把经过改进的联合器，拿到南湖农场的棉田里进行联合作业的试验。试验证明，联合器是能够同时进行四种作业的，而且撒肥均匀。但是，也发现它还有不少缺点，如中耕土层很板结的棉田，翻耕的泥土成大块状，产生了压伤幼苗的现象；中耕使用的铲子铲柄强度也不够，很容易弯曲。根据这些问题和农场工人们的意见，他们加装了一个多齿的切土耙，增强了铲柄的强度。在修改中，又不断拿到校内农场进行试验，随时听取群众意见。终于，对扶手、调节器械不灵活的地方，以至整个机件，都一一进行了研究和改进。7月间，陈润芳和钳工高玉瑞又把联合器背到天门县小庙公社，和社员们、公社干部、公社工厂工人一起反复试验和研究，听取农民们的意见，再进行修改。在工人、农民群众帮助下，经过二十多次反复改进，使联合器逐步完善、适用。
    联合器试制成功以后，立即受到了有关单位的欢迎。天门县不少公社纷纷要求更快地生产这种农具，使它更快地用到生产中去。湖北省科学技术委员会和有关单位很慎重地作了鉴定，肯定联合器基本试制成功，工效比人工操作提高十五倍以上，联合作业质量比人工操作质量高，可以保证农村在少花劳动力情况下做到精耕细作。同时决定，先在部分地区试验以后，再在全省范围内推广应用。
    前几天，记者到华中农学院访问了参加制作的陈润芳同志。这位年青教师兴奋地说：“这是我第一次搞科学研究，但也是一个良好的开端。我好像一个学走路的小孩一样，找到了正确的方向。我明确了科学研究和生产实际紧密结合，从生产中来，到生产中去，就能迅速地收到效果。我，一个知识分子离开了工农群众，是做不出这样的成绩的。这次参加研究试制工作，使我学到了许多东西，丰富和提高了自己。”
