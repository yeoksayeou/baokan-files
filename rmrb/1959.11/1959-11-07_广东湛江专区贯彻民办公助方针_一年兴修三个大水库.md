    Zhanjiang Prefecture, Guangdong Province Implements the Policy of Public Support for People-Run Projects
    Three Large Reservoirs Built in One Year
    The largest, the Hedi Reservoir, was completed in August, while the main structures of the Liangde Reservoir and the Xiaojiang Reservoir were completed in September. The irrigated area of the three reservoirs accounts for more than 40% of the total cultivated land in the district. With the continued construction of a number of small and medium-sized projects this winter and spring, most areas of the district can basically eliminate the threat of drought.
    (Dispatch from our newspaper) Guangdong's Zhanjiang Prefecture, in its water conservancy construction, adheres to the principle of public support for people-run projects, breaks down right-leaning conservative thinking, and has achieved a decisive victory in the construction of three large-scale water conservancy projects in the one year since communization. The total water storage capacity of the three reservoirs is 2.78 billion cubic meters. The Hedi Reservoir, with a storage capacity of 1.15 billion cubic meters, was completed at the end of August this year; the main structures of the Liangde Reservoir and the Xiaojiang Reservoir were completed before National Day. The irrigated area of the three major projects reaches 5.7 million mu, accounting for 40.7% of the district's cultivated land area, most of which is gravity-fed irrigation. With the continued construction of a number of small and medium-sized projects this winter and spring, most areas of the district will basically eliminate the threat of drought. The industrial water supply for Maoming City can thus be fully guaranteed.
    Zhanjiang Prefecture includes ten counties, two cities and one town, with a population of 8.54 million and a cultivated area of 14 million mu. It has always been a disaster-prone area, with natural disasters every year. During the great drought of 1943, in the Gaozhou County seat area alone, according to incomplete statistics, more than 12,000 people starved to death. Lingshan County seat was then a small town of less than 5,000 people, and the number of deaths also numbered in the thousands; more than 400 corpses were picked up in the vegetable market alone. The Jianjiang Plain, the Leizhou Peninsula and the Hepu Beihai area are even more prominent disaster areas.
    Since liberation, in order to guarantee and develop agricultural production and improve people's lives, the Party and the government have led the masses in a continuous struggle against natural disasters. The district has completed more than 370,000 small-scale water conservancy projects of less than 10,000 mu each, and 81 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects of more than 10,000 mu each. The existing irrigation equipment covers 8.54 million mu, which is more than 12 times the amount before liberation. In order to completely free the people of the district from the threat of drought, the above-mentioned three major reservoirs were started in June, August and September last year respectively.
    The scale of the three major projects is extraordinarily grand for Zhanjiang Prefecture. The catchment area is very wide: 1,440 square kilometers for Hedi Reservoir, 497 square kilometers for Liangde Reservoir, and 1,065 square kilometers for Xiaojiang Reservoir. The reservoir capacity is very large: 1.15 billion cubic meters for Hedi Reservoir, 630 million cubic meters for Liangde Reservoir, and 1 billion cubic meters for Xiaojiang Reservoir. The structures are very large: the Hedi Reservoir includes a main dam with a height of 28.25 meters, six auxiliary dams, 28 railway protection dikes with a length of 7 kilometers, a spillway with a discharge of 900 cubic meters per second, a canal head hub and a drainage ditch 5 kilometers long, etc.
    From the beginning to the end of the construction of the three major projects, political leadership was adhered to, and the right-leaning conservative thinking was combatted in the process of implementing the General Line. Before the start of construction, some people with right-leaning thoughts believed that "large-scale water conservancy projects cannot be done without massive government investment." Under the correct leadership of the Party committees, each construction site launched a debate on "Is it feasible to build large-scale water conservancy projects with public support for people-run projects?" By presenting facts and reasoning, everyone improved their understanding, mustered their energy, and the migrant workers built their own sheds, brought their own tools, overcame various difficulties, and solved the problem of raw materials. At the same time, they conscientiously implemented the policy of diligence and thrift in water management. As a result, only the relocation costs of the masses in the reservoir inundation areas and the construction costs of canal projects and larger buildings were subsidized by the government. There was also controversy over whether these water conservancy projects could be built more, faster, better and more economically by implementing public support for people-run projects. The focus of the debate was: can work efficiency be continuously improved? Can the task be completed on schedule? The vast majority of people were energetic and enthusiastic, and confident in completing the task. However, some people did not believe in the creativity and wisdom of the masses, and believed that work efficiency could not be improved and the plan could not be completed on schedule. When the Hedi Reservoir started to fill the dam, a technician saw that the average work efficiency had reached one cubic meter and said, "I would be satisfied if it could reach three cubic meters." When the average daily work efficiency broke the five cubic meter mark, he said again, "Although the five cubic meter mark has been broken, the question is whether it can be consolidated." As a result, the masses conquered the ten cubic meter mark. In the entire construction process, there was a shortage of technical force, and each construction site adopted the method of master bringing apprentice and the capable as teacher to cultivate talents. The Leizhou Youth Canal alone has trained more than 4,400 technical talents such as tractor drivers, electricians, stonemasons, carpenters, hydraulic engineers, medical personnel, and broadcasters in the past year or so, meeting the needs of project construction. In the mass movement of tool reform, everyone contributed ideas and everyone participated. During the construction process, there was a shortage of iron nails, so bamboo nails and iron nails were made; there were not enough saws, axes, and adzes, so the migrant workers made them themselves. Various factories were set up on the construction site, taking materials locally, manufacturing locally, and relying on their own efforts. In less than half a year, the Liangde Reservoir established more than 40 large and small factories such as a high-grade cement plant with a daily output of 20 tons, an explosives plant with a daily output of 2 tons, a detonator plant, a machinery repair plant, a vehicle plant, and a power plant, producing more than 1,300 tons of cement, more than 50,000 detonators, more than 90 tons of yellow explosives, and a large number of various equipment. In addition to meeting the needs of this project, the products also supported other water conservancy projects, and the yellow explosives alone saved the country more than 100,000 yuan, achieving more, faster, better and more economical results.
    The completion of the three major reservoirs fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes. First of all, the people's communes unified allocation and rational arrangement of labor, ensuring the number of workers at the construction site, and ensuring the year-round construction of the construction site. The number of workers at the three major construction sites reached a maximum of 240,000. It is conceivable that without the people's communes, it would be very difficult to maintain more than 100,000 migrant workers on a regular basis in the context of the great leap forward in various tasks last year. The people's communes also gave strong support to the construction site in terms of financial and material resources. According to a survey of five benefiting communes in Leibei County, the grain, wages, tool expenses, and travel expenses allocated by the commune reached 3.7 million yuan. Thanks to the new social organization of the people's communes, the progress of the project has been greatly promoted in terms of construction management and labor management. When erecting scaffolding at the Xiaojiang Reservoir, skilled technicians were needed for high-altitude operations, and skilled concrete workers were needed for building aqueducts, but they could not be found everywhere. Later, the commune sent plumbers and carpenters out to study, which not only solved the difficulty of the lack of technicians, but also created a record of mixing 3,300 wet cubic meters of ternary soil, mixing 11.4 cubic meters per man-day, and mixing one tank in two minutes. In terms of carpentry, the original requirement was to plane 15 square meters of formwork per man-day, but due to the high degree of initiative and enthusiasm of the commune members, the record of planing 161 square meters per day was achieved.

    广东湛江专区贯彻民办公助方针
    一年兴修三个大水库
    最大的鹤地水库在八月建成，良德水库和小江水库主体工程已在九月竣工。三个水库的灌溉面积占全区总耕地的百分之四十以上。加上今冬明春继续兴办一批中小型工程，全区绝大部分地区就可基本消除干旱威胁。
    本报讯　广东湛江专区在水利建设中坚持民办公助原则，大破右倾保守思想，在公社化一年中兴修的三个大型水利工程已经取得决定性胜利。三个水库蓄水总容量为二十七亿八千万公方，其中蓄水十一亿五千万公方的鹤地水库，已于今年8月底全部建成；良德水库和小江水库主体工程已于国庆节前夕完成。三大工程灌溉面积达五百七十万亩，占全区耕地面积的40.7％，大部分是自流灌溉。加上今冬明春继续兴办一批中小型工程，全区绝大部分地区将基本消除旱灾威胁。茂名市的工业用水，因此能得到充分的供应。
    湛江专区包括十县二市一镇，人口八百五十四万，耕地面积一千四百万亩，历来是一个重灾区，自然灾害年年都有。1943年大旱灾，单高州县城一带，据不完全统计，就饿死了一万二千多人。灵山县城当时是一个不足五千人口的小镇，死亡人数也以千计，城内菜市一地就捡拾了四百多具尸首。鉴江平原、雷州半岛和合浦北海一带，更是一个突出的重灾区。
    解放以来，党和政府为了保障和发展农业生产，改善人民生活，领导群众和自然灾害进行了不断的斗争。全区完成万亩以下小型水利工程三十七万多宗，万亩以上的大中型水利工程八十一宗。现有灌溉设备八百五十四万亩，为解放前实有水利设备的十二倍多。为了使全区人民彻底摆脱旱灾威胁，去年6月、8月、9月上述三大水库先后破土开工。
    三大工程的规模在湛江专区来说是异常宏伟的。集雨面积很广：鹤地水库一千四百四十平方公里，良德水库四百九十七平方公里，小江水库一千零六十五平方公里。库容量很大：鹤地水库十一点五亿公方，良德水库六点三亿公方，小江水库十亿公方。建筑物很庞大：如鹤地水库即包括坝高二十八点二五米的拦河主坝，六座副坝，长达七公里的二十八座铁路防护堤，泄水量九百秒公方的溢洪道，渠首枢纽和长五公里的排水沟等。
    三大工程从开始施工到结束，都坚持了政治挂帅，在贯彻总路线的过程中对右倾保守思想进行了斗争。施工开始以前，有右倾思想的人认为“办大型水利，不靠政府大量投资是办不成的”。各个工地在党委的正确领导下，开展了“民办公助兴修大型水利行不行？”的辩论。通过摆事实，说道理，大家提高了认识，鼓足了干劲，民工们自搭工棚、自带工具，克服各种困难，解决原材料问题，同时认真贯彻勤俭治水方针，结果，只有水库淹没区的群众搬迁费用及渠道工程和较大建筑物的兴建费用，由政府投资补助。实行民办公助，这些水利工程能否办得多快好省？又有争论。争论的焦点是：工效能否不断提高？能否如期完成任务？绝大多数人劲头大，热情高，对完成任务有信心。但是也有一些人不相信群众的创造和智慧，认为工效难以提高，不能按期完成计划。鹤地水库开始填坝时，有个技术人员看见平均工效已达一方就说：“能达到三方便满足了。”当每天平均工效破五方关时，他又说：“五方关虽破，问题在于能否巩固。”结果群众却攻克了十方关。在整个施工过程中，技术力量不足，各工地就采用师傅带徒弟和能者为师的办法去培养人材。单雷州青年运河，一年多来就培养了拖拉机手、电工、石工、木工、水工、医务人员、广播员等技术人材四千四百多人，满足了工程建设的需要。在大搞工具改革运动中，做到了人人献计，全民动手。施工过程中，铁钉不足，自制竹钉和铁钉；刀锯斧头不够，民工自己制造。工地办了各种工厂，就地取材，就地制造，自力更生。良德水库不到半年时间就办起了日产二十吨的高标号水泥厂、日产二吨的炸药厂及雷管厂、机械修配厂、车子厂、发电厂等大小工厂四十多个，生产了水泥一千三百多吨、雷管五万多个、黄色炸药九十多吨和大批的各种器材。产品除满足本工程的需要外，还支援了其它水利工程，单黄色炸药一项就为国家节省了十多万元，做到了又多又快又好又省。
    三大水库的建成，充分显示了人民公社无比的优越性。首先是人民公社对劳动力统一调配和合理安排，保证了工地出工人数，保证工地的常年施工，三大工地出工人数最高时达二十四万人。可以设想，如果没有人民公社，在去年各项工作大跃进的情况下，要经常保持十多万的民工是很困难的。人民公社在财力物力上也给了工地大力的支援。据雷北县五个受益公社的调查，由公社拨出的粮食、工资、工具费、旅费等就达三百七十万元。由于有了人民公社这个新的社会组织，在施工管理和劳动管理上大大推进了工程的进度。小江水库在搭排架时，要高空作业的技工，建筑渡槽时要熟练的混凝土工，但到处找不到。后来公社派出水、木工出去学习，不仅解决了技工缺乏的困难，而且创造了拌和三千三百湿的三合土方，每工日拌十一点四立方，二分钟拌一槽的纪录。在木工方面，原要求每工每日刨模十五平方，但由于公社社员的主动性和积极性的高度发挥，竟达到日刨一百六十一平方的纪录。
