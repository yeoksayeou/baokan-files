Complete Overhaul Plans Ahead of Schedule; Strengthen Daily Maintenance of Trains
Allow More Vehicles to Participate in Winter Transportation
National Railway Vehicle Work Conference Calls for Outstanding Completion of Tasks

    (Our Newspaper) News: The Ministry of Railways recently convened a national railway vehicle work on-site conference in Qiqihar City to mobilize railway vehicle workers across the country to explore the potential of vehicles in every possible way to ensure the completion of winter transportation tasks.

    The conference, based on the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, reviewed and criticized right-leaning and lax sentiments. The meeting held that the national industrial and agricultural production will complete the annual tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota, and the railway freight volume is also rising linearly. As the basic tool of railway transportation, vehicles are increasingly unable to meet the needs. Therefore, the conference issued a proposal to railway workers across the country: Fight hard in the fourth quarter, complete the vehicle overhaul tasks ahead of schedule, and strive to increase the utilization efficiency of 7,500 operating vehicles for the country. At the same time, in the fourth quarter, a large number of covered wagons should be transformed into convertible covered and open wagons to support the heavy coal transportation this winter. The conference also called on vehicle workers to strengthen the organization of vehicle repair work, further explore the potential of enterprises, promote the spirit of cooperation, fully prepare the supply of materials and accessories, and keep the number of vehicles awaiting repair within 800, and prepare for a "good start next year" in all aspects.

    In order to ensure traffic safety, the conference required leaders at all levels to take personal action, adopt measures, conscientiously implement rules and regulations, overcome the tendency of simply pursuing speed and ignoring safety, strengthen the daily maintenance of trains, not release a single faulty vehicle, and create a new record of long-term accident-free operation.

    The conference pointed out: In order to complete the above tasks, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously carry out mass movements, and widely carry out socialist competitions of "red people, red teams, red classes," "red days, red ten-day periods, red months," and "red vehicles in repair, red trains on every trip," and strive for outstanding achievements in the whole railway vehicle work with high quality, high yield, low consumption, and safety, and victoriously enter 1960.

    This conference also summarized the basic experience of the national railway vehicle departments in strengthening enterprise management in the past ten years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. It pointed out that it is necessary to ensure the absolute leadership of the Party over enterprises and adhere to putting politics in command; adhere to the principle of combining centralized leadership with vigorous mass movements; while carrying out vigorous mass movements, strengthen enterprise management, combine professional management with mass management, and conscientiously promote the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" working method. In business management, it is necessary to ensure that the small situation is subordinate to the overall situation and the local is subordinate to the whole, and resolutely implement the principle of the railway transportation as a whole.

    提前完成检修计划　加强列车日常维修
    让更多的车辆参加冬季运输
    全国铁路车辆工作会议要求出色地完成任务
    本报讯　铁道部于最近在齐齐哈尔市召开了全国铁路车辆工作现场会议，动员全国铁路车辆职工千方百计挖掘车辆潜力，确保完成冬季运输任务。
    会议根据八届八中全会精神，检查批判了右倾松劲情绪。会议认为：全国工农业生产都将提前和超额完成全年任务，铁路货运也正在直线上升。作为铁路运输基本工具的车辆，就日益感到不能满足需要。因此会议向全国铁路职工发出倡议：大战第四季度，提前完成车辆检修任务，争取为国家增加七千五百辆运用车的使用效率。同时，要在第四季度内把大量棚车改造为棚敞两用车，以支援今冬繁重的煤炭运输。会议还号召车辆职工加强修车组织工作，进一步挖掘企业的潜力，大兴协作之风，充分作好材料配件供应，把检修残车经常压缩在八百辆以内，并从各方面为“明年开门红”做好准备。
    为了确保行车安全，会议要求各级领导干部亲自动手，采取措施，认真执行规章制度，克服单纯图快忽视安全的偏向，加强列车的日常维修，不放出一辆故障车，创造长期无事故的新纪录。
    会议指出：为了完成上述任务，要坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，广泛开展“人红、组红、班红”，“日红、旬红、月红”，“修车辆辆红，列车趟趟红”的社会主义竞赛，力争全路车辆工作，以优质、高产、低耗、安全的出色成绩，胜利地跨进1960年。
    这次会议还总结了十年来，特别是1958年大跃进以来全国铁路车辆部门加强企业管理的基本经验。指出：必须保证党对企业的绝对领导，坚持政治挂帅；坚持集中领导与大搞群众运动相结合的方针；在大搞群众运动的同时，加强企业管理，把专业管理与群众管理结合起来，认真推行“两参一改三结合”的工作方法。在经营管理上必须小局服从大局，局部服从整体，坚决贯彻铁路运输一盘棋的方针。　		（纪静如）
