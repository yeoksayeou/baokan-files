Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 15th – TASS reports: The Economic Statistics Subcommittee of the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress began a special meeting on November 13th to study the comparison of economic development between the United States and the Soviet Union. The subcommittee meeting will continue until November 21st. Speaking at the meeting will be representatives of the U.S. government and more than thirty economic experts from various industrial federations, economic research institutions, and universities.

Prior to the meeting, the subcommittee had already released three reports that acknowledged the possibility of the Soviet Union catching up with the United States in economic development within the projected period; the Soviet economy is "stronger than some people in the United States have imagined in the past and at present;" and in the next decade, the Soviet economy will continue to surpass the U.S. economy in terms of annual growth rate of industrial production.

The subcommittee will study the issues raised in the reports and discuss comparative materials on the modern economic development of the Soviet Union and the United States, issues related to the economic structure and organization of the two countries, comparisons of the overall trends of the two economies, and the prospects for the next decade.

Now, especially after the visit of Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Khrushchev, many Americans have begun to understand that the path of peaceful coexistence between two different systems is the only possible way to develop Soviet-American relations. The U.S. ruling group is now forced to admit that the scale of Soviet economic development is "threatening," and they are trying to find ways to help them "answer the new Soviet challenge."

Although the Director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, Allen Dulles, concealed facts in his speech to the subcommittee on November 13 in order to belittle the achievements and possible development of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, he was actually forced to admit the strength and power of the Soviet economy and the national economic system of the entire socialist countries. Allen Dulles said that the Soviet Union is "the most authoritative" in the production of steel, refractory metals, electronics, aeronautics and space technology, atomic energy, and machine tool manufacturing.

    苏联经济巨大步伐震撼美国
    美国会小组委员会慌忙开会研究对策
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿讯：美国国会两院经济联合委员会经济统计小组委员会13日开始举行特别会议，研究美苏两国经济发展对比问题。小组委员会会议将一直开到11月21日为止。在会上发言的将有美国政府代表以及各工业联合会、经济研究机构和各大学的三十多名经济问题专家。
    在举行会议以前，这个小组委员会已经发表了三个报告，这些报告承认，苏联在预定的期间内在经济发展方面有赶上美国的可能；苏联经济“比美国有些人士过去和现在所想像的要强盛”；在今后十年中，苏联经济在工业生产的年度增长速度方面，仍将超过美国经济。
    小组委员会将研究报告提出的这些问题，并将讨论苏美两国现代经济发展的比较材料、苏美两国经济结构和组织问题、两国经济总的趋向的比较和今后十年的前景。
    现在，特别是在苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫访问之后，很多美国人都开始理解两种不同制度和平共处的道路是发展苏美关系的唯一可能的途径。美国统治集团现在被迫承认苏联经济的发展规模是“具有威胁性的”，他们竭力想找寻一些办法来帮助他们“回答苏联新的挑战”。
    美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯13日在这个小组委员会上的发言尽管为了贬低苏联和其他社会主义国家的成就和可能的发展而隐瞒事实，但是，他实际上被迫承认了苏联经济和整个社会主义国家国民经济制度的力量和强大。艾伦·杜勒斯说，在生产钢铁、耐火金属、电子学、航空学和宇宙技术、原子能、机床制造等方面，苏联“是最权威的”。
