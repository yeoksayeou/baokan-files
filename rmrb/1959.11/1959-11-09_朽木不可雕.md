    Rotten Wood Cannot Be Carved

    Nixon has recently made quite a few defenses for the sunset-bound capitalist system. However, as the saying goes, rotten wood cannot be carved, and defending something decadent is the most laborious task. Nixon is no exception.

    On November 2nd, at a special economic conference held in Washington, Nixon once again admitted that "the Soviet Union is making progress," but he then audaciously said that the reason the Soviet Union can make progress is "because they are using our methods." What kind of American treasure is it, then? The American Vice President replied: "The private property system or the reward system like bank accounts encourages concentrated effort." So, it turns out that it is the private property system, the very thing that makes the capitalist system unable to escape decay and death, that, according to Nixon's astonishing "discovery," has become the "method" for the Soviet Union to make progress!

    In order to strengthen his defensive argument, Nixon also particularly emphasized that this was based on his observations during his visit to the Soviet Union. But even elementary school students know that the October Revolution has long consigned the cannibalistic system of private ownership to the museum of history forever. What Nixon could find in the Soviet Union, and what he was afraid to see, was the radiant socialist system. At the same time, people also remember how Nixon was questioned and refuted by the Soviet people everywhere when he boasted about the American system and way of life in the Soviet Union, leaving Nixon speechless. Therefore, Nixon's "discovery" can only remind people of the story in the masterpiece "Dead Souls." Moreover, Nixon doesn't even have Chichikov's good luck, because Chichikov could still buy dead souls in large quantities and flaunt his wealth as a big aristocratic landlord, while Nixon, on the other hand, can only cling to his rotten capitalist system, exposing his panic in the face of peaceful competition.

    朽木不可雕
    尼克松近来替日落西山的资本主义制度所作的辩护真是够多的了。但是，古语说，朽木不可雕，替腐朽的东西辩护是最吃力的。尼克松也不能例外。
    11月2日尼克松在华盛顿举行的一次特别经济会议上再次承认“苏联正在取得进展”，但他接着斗胆地说什么苏联所以能取得进展是“因为他们在使用我们的方法”。究竟美国的什么样的好宝贝呢？这位美国副总统答曰：“私有财产制或银行账户那种奖励制度鼓励了集中的努力”。原来啊，竟是私有财产制这个使资本主义制度不能免于腐朽和死亡的东西，而按照尼克松的惊人“发见”，这个东西却成为苏联取得进展的“方法”了！
    尼克松为了加强他的辩护论据，还特别强调，这是根据他在访问苏联时观察所得的。但连小学生也知道，十月革命早已把私有制这个吃人的制度永远送进了历史博物馆。尼克松在苏联能够发见的，也是他所害怕见到的，是万丈光芒的社会主义制度。同时，人们还记得，尼克松在苏联吹嘘美国的制度和生活方式时如何到处受到苏联人的诘问和反驳，使尼克松为之瞠目结舌。因此，尼克松的“发见”，只能使人联想到“死魂灵”这部杰作中的故事。而且，尼克松甚至还没有乞乞科夫的好运道，因为乞乞科夫还能大批的收买死魂灵，炫耀过他的大贵族大地主的阔气，而尼克松呢，只能抱着他的腐烂的资本主义制度，暴露他在和平竞赛面前的惊惶失措。
