    Recent Political Situation in Argentina
    Zhang Ye
    The current political situation in Argentina continues to be in a state of severe crisis. This is the result of the Frondizi government abandoning its election platform, yielding to reactionary forces at home and abroad, and implementing policies of hunger and terror against the people and progressive forces. Frondizi won the support of the working class and democratic progressive forces by advocating anti-imperialism and land reform, and was elected president in the February 1958 election. However, shortly after taking office in May of the same year, he wavered and compromised under the attack of reactionary forces at home and abroad. First, he transferred a large number of oil exploration rights, and then implemented the "economic stabilization plan" formulated by the "International Monetary Fund" controlled by the United States. He adopted a policy of violent suppression and terror against domestic patriotic and democratic forces.
    The Frondizi government's implementation of policies that favored US imperialism and domestic reactionary forces has primarily brought serious consequences to Argentina's economy. The implementation of the "economic stabilization plan" not only failed to alleviate the economic crisis as Frondizi had promised to the people, but it exacerbated the crisis and increased dependence on US imperialism, greatly facilitating the penetration and control of US monopoly capital over Argentina's economy. According to official announcements, the national budget deficit is estimated to reach 40 billion pesos (the Argentine currency unit) in the fiscal year ending October 31, 1959. In order to make up for the deficit, paper money was issued indiscriminately, resulting in a sharp devaluation of the peso and a sharp rise in living expenses. The exchange rate of the peso against the US dollar fell from 18 to 1 at the beginning of 1959 to 110 to 1 in June. Living expenses rose by 80% in the first nine months of this year.
    Another damage to the Argentine economy caused by the implementation of the "economic stabilization plan" is the stagnation of industrial production, the increase in the trade scissors difference, and the increasing imbalance of international payments. Argentina's industrial production in May this year has fallen by 12.7% compared with the same period last year.
    In agriculture, since the Frondizi government completely abandoned its promise to implement land reform, Argentina's land is rapidly being concentrated in the hands of large estate owners and imperialist enterprises. One American company purchased 3 million hectares of land in Argentina in 1958 through various means, equivalent to the size of several Argentine provinces. In April this year, Argentina suffered severe floods, and grains, oilseeds, cotton, etc. suffered significant crop failures, with estimated losses of about 66 million US dollars. Argentina had to import rice and cottonseed oil from the United States at high prices to supply the market. The livestock industry has also greatly reduced the number of cattle due to the large number of slaughters and exports in the past few years. Since December last year, two days a week have been designated as "meatless days," forcing reductions in domestic consumption. Beef exports in the first four months of this year also decreased by 50,000 tons compared with the same period last year.
    At the beginning of his administration, Frondizi implemented some democratic measures under the pressure of the surging people's movement. However, due to the pressure from US imperialism and domestic reactionaries, the Frondizi government was actually under the control of the military clique and other reactionary forces. During the election, Frondizi reached a secret agreement with Perón, whom he had previously "strongly" opposed. At the same time, he also undertook obligations to senior religious figures, the military clique that had controlled the provisional government, some large landowners and capitalists, and to foreign, especially US monopoly capital. Frondizi attempted to maintain his presidential position by relying on the support of US imperialism and utilizing the mutual contradictions of various domestic reactionary forces. This enabled US and British imperialism to smoothly strengthen political control through their agents in Argentina, thereby making Argentina's political situation turbulent.
    Argentina's successive political crises have occurred under these circumstances. In July 1958, pro-British elements in the navy attempted to launch a coup but failed. In November, Vice President Gómez resigned due to political differences with Frondizi, and Argentine officials accused him of participating in a conspiracy to overthrow President Frondizi. Since the beginning of this year, reactionary military and political figures have launched several coups that quickly failed, and the cabinet has been reorganized several times under the coercion of reactionary groups. In June of this year, right-wing soldiers launched a bloodless "palace coup," forcing the cabinet to resign. Through this coup, many demands of the right-wing forces were met. Frondizi appointed Alsogaray as Minister of Economy and temporarily concurrently Minister of Labor and Social Insurance, monopolizing the power to strictly control the national economy. Alsogaray is a notorious agent of American monopoly organizations, and has always openly advocated free enterprise and the granting of oil exploration rights to American monopoly capital. Sure enough, in July, the Frondizi government intensified the implementation of "de-nationalization," selling the Buenos Aires slaughterhouse and refrigeration plant, which had been state-owned for 30 years, to private individuals, and also planned to transfer many state-owned enterprises such as the Argentine Automobile Transportation Company to private individuals. At the same time, after Alsogaray took office, he stepped up the implementation of the "economic stabilization plan," announcing that he would massively cut government employees and not allow wage increases.
    However, US imperialism and the Argentine right-wing forces were not satisfied with Frondizi's concessions, and another political crisis occurred in early September. With Frondizi's support, Army Minister Anaya ordered the dismissal of anti-Peronist Army Commander-in-Chief Montero, who had taken office after the June "palace coup," and appointed Castiñeiras, who sympathized with Perón and Frondizi, to replace him. However, supported by a group of generals, Montero refused to leave his post and demanded that Frondizi reorganize the government and replace a group of senior military officers in order to further lean towards US imperialism. This crisis was ostensibly "resolved" with the resignation of Army Minister Anaya, but the struggle for power and profit among different groups still exists, and new crises are still lurking.
    The perverse actions of the Frondizi government have played the role of a negative teacher for the Argentine people. The Argentine people are increasingly seeing the reactionary face of the Frondizi government, and thus more vigorously launched the struggle for national independence and people's democracy. As Comrade Victorio Codovilla, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Argentine Communist Party, said: "Every reactionary measure by the capitalists and the state, and every interference by US monopoly capital, is met with strikes, demonstrations, and other forms of protest and struggle by the working class and the people." Since the strike launched by oil workers in Mendoza Province in November last year to defend national oil resources, the Argentine working class has continuously launched strikes and demonstrations, regardless of the government's state of emergency, opposing the freezing of wages and the rise in living expenses. On January 17 and 18, a nationwide general strike broke out against the transfer of state-owned slaughterhouses to private capital; on January 18, when Frondizi led his entourage to the United States for a visit, 10,000 people held demonstrations to protest Frondizi's transfer of national interests to the United States. From February to June, there were a total of 329 strikes in Argentina, many of which were general strikes, involving more than 3 million workers. At the end of July, about 1.2 million agricultural workers and 200,000 sugar workers went on strike across the country. On August 25, a large strike of 300,000 metallurgical workers broke out; on September 23, a 48-hour nationwide general strike of nearly 4 million people broke out. This was the largest strike by the Argentine working class this year. The strikers included workers from all factions, and received the support of various democratic parties, as well as women, students, business circles, and other strata, forming a massive mass movement against subservience to US slavery.
    Due to the persistence of the Communists in uniting and the fact that the lower-level masses of various trade unions have formed a strong force of unity in the common struggle, the workers' movement is moving towards unity and cooperation. During the 300,000 metallurgical workers' strike held in August, organizations such as the 62 Unions, the Trade Union Solidarity and Cooperation Movement, the Argentine Electricity Workers' Federation, the Aviation Personnel Association, and the Argentine Telegraph, Radio, and Related Personnel Association signed a 13-point program for common struggle, and agreed to establish a National Trade Union Joint Committee to implement this program. The 13 points of the program include demands to stop the denationalization of state enterprises, oppose the rise in living expenses, defend trade union rights and freedoms, and implement profound land reform.
    The compromise and surrender of the Frondizi government and the instability of the Argentine situation have made the people's struggle increasingly high and the workers' movement is moving towards unity. At present, the struggle of the Argentine working class, especially the 4 million-person nationwide general strike held on September 23 and 24, was carried out and won with the joint action of Communists, Peronists, Socialists, Radicals, and other patriotic and democratic people. The Argentine people's struggle for national independence and people's democracy will continue to develop.

    最近的阿根廷政治局势
    章叶
    目前的阿根廷政治局势，继续处于严重的危机中。这是弗朗迪西政府背弃自己的竞选纲领，对国内外反动势力屈服，对人民和进步力量执行饥饿和恐怖政策的结果。弗朗迪西是打着反帝和实行土地改革的旗子，取得工人阶级和民主进步力量的支持，在1958年2月的选举中当选总统的。但是，他在同年5月就任后不久，就在国内外反动势力进攻下动摇妥协，先是大量出让石油开采权，继而执行美国所一手控制的“国际货币基金组织”拟定的“稳定经济计划”，对国内爱国民主力量则采取暴力镇压的恐怖政策。
    弗朗迪西政府执行有利于美帝国主义和国内反动势力的政策，首先给阿根廷的经济带来了严重的后果。由于执行“稳定经济计划”，不但没有像弗朗迪西向人民许诺那样使经济危机得到缓和，反而使危机更加加剧，并且增加了对美帝国主义的依赖程度，大大地便利了美国垄断资本对阿根廷经济的渗入和控制。据官方宣布，在到1959年10月31日为止的财政年度中，国家预算赤字估计将达四百亿比索（阿根廷货币单位）。为了弥补赤字，就滥发纸币，结果是比索猛烈贬值，生活费用急剧上涨。比索对美元的比价，从1959年年初的十八比一，下跌到6月的一百一十比一。生活费用今年头九个月上涨了80％。
    实行“稳定经济计划”对阿根廷经济的另一损害是工业生产停滞，贸易剪刀差增加，国际收支差额越来越大。阿根廷今年5月间的工业生产已经比去年同期下降了12.7％。
    在农业方面，由于弗朗迪西政府根本背弃它实行土地改革的诺言，阿根廷的土地正在迅速向大庄园主和帝国主义企业集中。有一家美国公司在1958年通过各种手段在阿根廷购买了三百万公顷的土地，等于阿根廷几个省那样大。今年4月，阿根廷暴雨成灾，谷物、油籽、棉花等都大大歉收，估计损失约达六千六百万美元。阿根廷不得不以高价从美国进口大米和棉籽油来供应市场。畜牧业也因为前几年大量屠宰和出口，牛的头数大大减少。从去年12月起每周规定两天为“无肉日”，强迫削减国内的消费量。今年头四个月出口的牛肉也比去年同期减少了五万吨。
    弗朗迪西执政之初，在高涨的人民运动压力下，曾经实行一些民主措施。但由于美帝国主义和国内反动派的压力，弗朗迪西政府实际上处于军人集团和其他反动势力的控制之下。弗朗迪西在竞选中就曾同他原来所“极力”反对的庇隆达成一项秘密协议，同时对高级宗教人士、曾经控制临时政府的军人集团、一部分大地主和大资产阶级以及对外国，特别是美国垄断资本也承担了义务。弗朗迪西企图依靠美帝国主义的支持和利用国内各种反动势力的互相矛盾来维持他的总统职位。这就使美英帝国主义能顺利地通过在阿根廷的代理人加强政治控制，从而使阿根廷政治局势动荡不安。
    阿根廷历次政治危机，就是在这种情况下发生的。1958年7月，海军中的亲英分子企图发动政变未果。11月，副总统戈麦斯由于和弗朗迪西在政治上有分歧意见而辞职，阿根廷官方人士指责他参加推翻弗朗迪西总统的阴谋。今年以来，反动军政人士发动了几次很快就失败了的政变，内阁在反动集团的胁迫下也改组过好几次。今年6月，右派军人发动一次不流血的“宫廷政变”，迫使内阁辞职。通过这次政变，右派势力的很多要求得到了满足，弗朗迪西任命阿耳索加赖为经济部长，并临时兼任劳工和社会保险部长，独揽严格控制全国经济的大权。阿耳索加赖是一个臭名昭彰的美国垄断组织代理人，一直公开主张自由企业和把石油开采权让与美国垄断资本。果然，在7月间，弗朗迪西政府就变本加厉地实行“非国有化”，把三十年来一直是国营的布宜诺斯艾利斯屠宰冷藏场卖给私人，还打算把阿根廷汽车运输公司等许多国营企业转让给私人。同时，阿耳索加赖上台后，加紧执行“稳定经济计划”，宣布要大量裁减政府雇员和不准增加工资。
    但是，美帝国主义和阿根廷右派势力对弗朗迪西的让步还不满足，9月初又发生一次政治危机。陆军部长安纳亚在弗朗迪西支持下，下令解除6月“宫廷政变”后上台的反庇隆的陆军总司令蒙特罗的职务，并任命一个同情庇隆和弗朗迪西的卡斯蒂拉斯来代替他。但蒙特罗在一批将领的支持下拒绝离职，并向弗朗迪西提出改组政府和撤换一批高级军官的要求，以便进一步投靠美帝国主义。这一次危机表面上以陆军部长安纳亚离职而“解决”了，但是，不同集团争权夺利的斗争还存在着，新的危机还在潜伏着。
    弗朗迪西政府的倒行逆施，对阿根廷人民起了反面教员的作用。阿根廷人民越来越看清楚弗朗迪西政府的反动面目，因而更加有力地开展了争取民族独立和人民民主的斗争。正像阿根廷共产党中央委员会书记维克托里奥·柯都维亚同志所说的：“资本家和国家的每一个反动措施以及美国垄断资本的每一个干涉，都遭到工人阶级和人民局部罢工和总罢工、示威游行和其他抗议和斗争形式的反击。”从去年11月门多萨省石油工人为保卫国家石油资源而发动的罢工以后，阿根廷的工人阶级不顾政府的紧急戒严令，连续展开了罢工斗争和示威游行，反对冻结工资和生活费用的上涨。1月17日和18日，爆发了全国性的总罢工，反对把国营屠宰场交给私人资本；在1月18日弗朗迪西率领随行人员赴美访问前往机场时，有一万人举行示威游行，反对弗朗迪西把民族利益出让给美国。2月到6月，阿根廷共发生了三百二十九起罢工，其中有许多是总罢工，参加的有三百多万工人。7月底，全国各地大约有一百二十万农业工人和二十万糖业工人举行罢工。8月25日爆发了三十万冶金工人的大罢工；9月23日爆发了将近四百万人的四十八小时全国总罢工。这是今年以来阿根廷工人阶级所举行的最大一次罢工，参加罢工的包括了各派系的工人，得到了各民主党派以及妇女、学生、商界等其他阶层的支持，形成一个反对屈从美国奴役的声势浩大的群众运动。
    由于共产党人坚持团结以及在共同斗争中各派工会的下层群众已经结成一股强大的团结力量，工人运动正走向团结合作。在8月间举行的三十万冶金工人大罢工中，六十二工会、工会团结合作运动、阿根廷电力工人联合会、航空人员协会和阿根廷电报、无线电和有关人员协会等组织，签订了一项共同斗争的十三点纲领，并且同意成立全国工会联合委员会来实现这个纲领。这十三条纲领包括要求停止国家企业非国有化、反对生活费用上涨、保卫工会权利和自由、实行深刻的土地改革等。
    弗朗迪西政府的妥胁投降和阿根廷局势的不稳，使得人民的斗争日益高涨和工人运动走向团结。目前，阿根廷工人阶级的斗争，特别是9月23日和24日举行的四百万人全国总罢工，就是在共产党人、庇隆分子、社会党人、激进党人和其他爱国民主人士共同行动下进行并取得胜利的。阿根廷人民争取民族独立和人民民主的斗争将继续发展。
