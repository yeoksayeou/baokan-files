Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 5th. (By our correspondent Li Nan) The great 42nd anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution is about to arrive amidst the triumphant songs of Soviet communist construction. The streets of Moscow are enveloped in a festive atmosphere, and Muscovites are filled with joy and excitement. In the days leading up to the October Revolution Day, the entire city presents a magnificent scene, stirring the heart.

In this era of accelerated communist construction, the 42nd anniversary of the October Revolution, celebrated by Muscovites and all the Soviet people, is an extraordinary time. The first year of the Seven-Year Plan, like a vibrant brush, paints a brilliant picture of the comprehensive unfolding of communist construction in the Soviet Union. Triumphant songs of victory, achievements in labor, the soaring enthusiasm for communism, and the magnificent pace forward – all these give this year's festival a unique style and make pre-holiday Moscow even more splendid.

The entire city of Moscow has been decorated with lanterns and is brilliantly illuminated. In order to welcome the grand parade and festive revelry, special and wonderful festive decorations have been set up in Red Square and the squares and streets radiating from it. In these decorations, people can see many figurative depictions showcasing the magnificent achievements of the Soviet people this year. The splendid scenery of the Central Telegraph Building and Gorky Street focuses on one theme: the Soviet working people are striving with great enthusiasm for a bountiful harvest this year and are preparing with fervent energy to take even greater strides next year.

In the festive decorations on the streets of Moscow, people can see rocket models shining on high-rise buildings and artificial satellite models rotating in shop windows. Everywhere, one can see the words beloved by the Soviet and world people – "Peace" and "Friendship" – shining on buildings, glittering in the night sky. The calls to "Fulfill the Seven-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule!" and "Advance to the Victory of Communism!" form a sea of light in Pushkin Square and Sverdlov Square.

In the rich and varied propaganda posters on the streets, people can also see a particularly striking picture: Chinese and Soviet youth hand in hand, holding high Lenin's works and bright red flags, with four large Chinese characters above: "Eternal Friendship."

In the days leading up to the festival, people can also see the scene of "Moving into New Homes to Celebrate the Festival," which is a Moscow tradition for celebrating the holiday. In order to enable people to enjoy the festival, many shops in Moscow remain open until midnight. New plays are being staged in theaters, and new films are being shown in cinemas.

These days, Muscovites are busy. The competition launched by factories and enterprises to welcome the festival is developing vigorously. Reports of successes in production and construction are coming from all directions. At the same time, celebration gatherings in various districts, enterprises, and organizations have already begun. From the cultural palaces of various factories and enterprises, come bursts of music and singing, as workers prepare programs for the festival.

Many international trains and planes are carrying foreign friends to Moscow. The strong impressions they get in Moscow as they welcome the festival are: the Soviet people admire friendship, the Soviet people resolutely defend peace, and the Soviet people are building communism. In early November, the scenery of Moscow is equally attractive. As dusk falls, a layer of mist rises over the unfrozen Moscow River, and the city's high-rise buildings are brightly lit. Muscovites are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the festival.

    莫斯科披上节日盛装
    新华社莫斯科5日电　本社记者李楠报道：伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年佳节，就要在苏联共产主义建设高唱凯歌声中来临了。莫斯科的街头笼罩着节日的气氛，莫斯科人流露着欢欣鼓舞的情绪。在迎接十月革命节的日子里，整个城市显得气象万千，使人心情激动。
    在加速共产主义建设的时代，莫斯科人和全苏联人民庆祝的十月革命四十二周年是个不平凡的岁月。七年计划的第一年像一支生花彩笔，绘出了苏联全面展开共产主义建设的灿烂图景。胜利的凯歌、劳动的成就、共产主义的高涨热情、壮阔前进的步伐——这一切使得今年这个节日别具一番风格，使节日前的莫斯科更加生色。
    莫斯科全城已经张灯结彩，灯炬辉煌。为了迎接节日的盛大游行和节日的狂欢活动，在红场和从红场辐射出去的广场和街道上，特别进行了精彩的节日装饰。在这些装饰中，人们可以看到表彰苏联人民今年取得的宏伟成绩的许多形象的画面。中央电报大楼和高尔基大街的绚丽景色集中说明了一个主题：苏联劳动人民干劲冲天地争取着今年的劳动丰收，而且正在热情充沛地准备在明年跨出更大的步伐。
    在莫斯科街头的节日装饰中，人们可以看见火箭模型在高楼上闪烁，人造卫星模型在橱窗里旋转。到处可以看到苏联和世界人民心爱的字眼——“和平”、“友谊”在建筑物上辉耀，在夜空中闪闪发光。“提前完成七年计划！”“向共产主义胜利前进！”的号召，在普希金广场、斯维德洛夫广场组成了一片光芒。
    在街头丰富多采的宣传画中，人们还可以看到这样一幅特别醒目的图画：中苏两国青年手挽手，高举着列宁的著作和鲜红的旗帜，上面是四个中文大字：“永恒友谊。”
    在节日来临的前夕，人们也可以看到“庆节日搬新居”的景象，这是莫斯科人过节的传统。为了使人们能够欢度佳节，莫斯科的许多商店一直营业到深夜十二时。各剧院正在上演新剧，电影院正在放映新片。
    这些天来，莫斯科人在忙碌着。各工厂企业为迎接节日而展开的竞赛，正在蓬勃发展。生产和建设的捷报正在从四面八方传来。同时，各个区、企业、机关的庆祝集会已经开始举行。从各个工厂企业的文化宫里，传来了一阵阵乐曲和歌声，这是职工们在为节日准备节目。
    许多趟国际列车、一架架的飞机把国外的友人载来莫斯科。莫斯科在迎接节日中使他们获得的强烈印象是：苏联人民赞美友谊，苏联人民坚决保卫和平，苏联人民在建设着共产主义。11月初，莫斯科的景色同样是诱人的。当黄昏降临以后，未冻的莫斯科河上腾起了一层薄雾，全市高楼大厦灯火辉煌。莫斯科人在热情地等待着节日的来临。
