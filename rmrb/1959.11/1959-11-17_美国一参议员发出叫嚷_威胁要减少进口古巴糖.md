Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th Dispatch: As the Cuban government accelerates the takeover of American plantation owners' land in Cuba, some political figures in the United States are once again clamoring to reduce Cuban sugar imports.

Chairman Ellender of the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee threatened on the 14th that the U.S. Congress might cut Cuba's quota in the U.S. sugar market unless the Castro government changes its policies. In his speech, Ellender fiercely attacked Cuba's land reform and Prime Minister Castro, describing Castro as a "rabble-rouser." He said, "If a sober and democratic government is established there (Cuba), I would be willing to keep Cuba's sugar quota unchanged."

Prior to this, American news agencies released information saying that the U.S. State Department is considering requesting Congress to authorize President Eisenhower to set quotas for foreign sugar imports. Sources revealed that some U.S. officials believe that giving the President this power is a means of "exerting pressure on the Castro government when necessary."

    美国一参议员发出叫嚷
    威胁要减少进口古巴糖
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：在古巴政府加速接管美国大庄园主在古巴的土地的同时，美国一些政界人士再次叫嚣要减少古巴蔗糖的进口。
    美国参议院农业委员会主席埃伦德14日威胁说，美国国会可能削减古巴在美国蔗糖市场上的定额，除非卡斯特罗政府改变它的政策。埃伦德在谈话中猛烈攻击古巴的土地改革和卡斯特罗总理，把卡斯特罗说成是“暴民鼓动者”。他说，“如果在那里（古巴）建立了头脑清醒的、民主政府的话，我就愿意让古巴的糖的定额不变。”
    在这以前，美国通讯社放出空气说，美国国务院正在考虑要求国会使艾森豪威尔总统有权规定外国蔗糖进口的定额。消息透露，美国某些官员认为，给总统这种权利是作为“在必要时对卡斯特罗政府施加压力的手段。”
