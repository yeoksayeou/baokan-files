Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 14th: Representatives from Anshan City attending the National Conference of Heroes participated in a broadcast rally to the city's people at the People's Auditorium on the afternoon of the 13th, reporting on their experiences. Over 100,000 people in Anshan City listened to their reports.

At noon on the 13th, as the train carrying the representatives slowly pulled into Anshan Station, music, gongs, drums, and applause erupted from the welcoming crowd. Old hero Meng Tai, technical innovation expert Wang Chonglun, steelmaking expert Li Shaokui, and all the representatives were immediately surrounded by the welcoming crowd as they stepped off the train onto the platform. People eagerly shook their hands and greeted them.

At the broadcast rally, Zhao Min, the Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, who led the delegation to Beijing, reported on the grand occasion of attending the Conference of Heroes and learning from the advanced experiences of fraternal units across the country, and conveyed the earnest expectations of the Party and state leaders. Li Shaokui, a steelmaking expert from the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, reported that they learned from the advanced experiences introduced by representatives from fraternal steel enterprises in Shanghai, Chongqing, Daye, and other places, as well as the advanced experiences of small blast furnaces, small converters, and small open-hearth furnaces from various regions at the Conference of Heroes. He also expressed his intention to earnestly promote these experiences, ensure the comprehensive and over-fulfillment of this year's steel leap forward plan, and prepare for the continued leap forward in production next year. Representatives attending the Conference of Heroes, including Meng Qingchun, a steel rolling expert from the initial rolling mill, Zeng Zhaoxiang, an assistant engineer from the Mining Design Institute, Wang Shaozeng, a technician from the Liaoyang Cotton Textile Factory, and Sun Ying, a salesperson from the Lishan District Sanba Grain Station, also reported on their learning from the advanced experiences of fraternal units across the country, expressing their determination to take the lead in carrying out the socialist labor competition of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward."

Li Weimin, the Mayor of Anshan City, expressed warm congratulations to the heroes on behalf of the city's workers and people at the rally. He hoped that the representatives would rapidly disseminate all the valuable advanced experiences gained at the conference to all sectors and industries, and take the lead in deeply carrying out the socialist labor competition of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward," to ensure that this year's production and construction are a complete success, and to prepare for a good start in the first quarter of next year's production and construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 14th: More than ten advanced producers from Shanghai, Jilin, Shandong, Yunnan, and other places who attended the National Conference of Heroes came to Tianjin on the 11th to "deliver treasures and transmit sutras." These advanced producers are production experts in industries such as machinery, textiles, printing and dyeing, and steelmaking. They were warmly welcomed by the workers of Tianjin.

Advanced producers in the machinery industry gave brilliant technical demonstrations at the Tianjin Tractor Factory, and more than 400 machinery workers from the city visited and learned from them. Zhu Daxian, a lathe operator from the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory and an expert in heavy cutting, demonstrated the operating methods of heavy cutting in the tractor workshop. Shi Wanfu, a worker from the crankshaft group who assisted him, concentrated on recording his experience, preparing to implement it in production. Li Fuxiang, a porcelain enameler from the Shanghai Boiler Factory, demonstrated a non-porous threading operation, which took only eight seconds for the two processes of drilling and threading, increasing production efficiency by two to three times compared to normal. Yang Jinquan, a lathe operator from the Shanghai No. 7 Machine Tool Factory, demonstrated a non-stop chuck, which workers called a "unique skill." He taught two workers how to use his tool on the spot and gave the tractor factory a set of blueprints for making such tools.

Ding Gendi, a roving worker from the Shanghai No. 17 State-owned Cotton Mill, Ni Haibao, a weaver from the No. 9 Mill, and Pan Wenshu, a winding worker from the Jinan Renfeng Yarn Mill, demonstrated three special skills at the Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, which aroused the strong interest of their sisters in the same industry. Feng Guizhu, a model worker and winding worker from Tianjin, learned Pan Wenshu's advanced operating method on the spot; Zhang Yuzhen, a roving worker, learned Ding Gendi's splicing method. Dai Renli, a young Yi ethnic technician from the Yunnan Printing and Dyeing Factory, introduced more than ten experiences to the workers in the silk workshop of the Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory. When the director of the silk workshop raised the issue of uneven color depth when using Indigosol dyes, Dai Renli immediately wrote down their advanced formula. Regarding water washing equipment, he also carefully drew a sketch and promised to send back the water washing and photosensitive formula information after returning. The workers in the silk workshop also enthusiastically gave Dai Renli the operating data for dyeing cotton cloth, as well as samples of electrostatic flocking, complete drawings and technical data.

Tao Gongda, the director of a workshop at the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, and Zhang Zhijiang, a furnace mason from the Shanghai No. 5 Steel Plant, both advanced producers in the steel industry, held discussions with workers from the Tianjin No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 Steel Plants, as well as the Refractory Materials Factory, exchanging advanced experiences in rapid furnace construction and assembly line furnace construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 14th: After more than one hundred representatives from Tianjin City who attended the National Conference of Heroes returned to Tianjin on the 11th, they immediately introduced the grand occasion of the Conference of Heroes and disseminated advanced experiences to workers throughout the city.

Wang Shutian, a well-known innovation expert and young fitter from the North China Sewing Machine Factory, went straight back to the workshop as soon as he got off the train, even without eating. While asking his partners about the production situation, he excitedly introduced what he saw and heard at the Conference of Heroes. Based on the advanced experiences he learned and the key problems in the factory's production, he worked overnight to summarize eight technical innovation measures. After these measures are implemented, the process of producing some sewing machine parts can be reduced from the original twenty-five steps to one, and the product quality can also be improved. Early in the morning on the 12th, Wang Shutian reported his innovation measures to the Party organization and immediately began designing and testing them with the support of the Party organization.

The workers of Class A of the Third Workshop of the Tianjin No. 3 Steel Rolling Plant were very excited after hearing that Zhu Jinyun, the representative of their workshop, introduced the advanced experiences he brought back from Beijing. They were even more motivated, and completed the annual production task at noon on the 11th in one go, entering 1960 ahead of schedule.

Lu Shan, the captain of the famous steel bar worker youth assault team, and Liu Changhe, the captain of the bricklaying team, both representatives of advanced collectives in the construction system, introduced the instructions of the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee and the advanced experiences of various places at the Conference of Heroes after returning to the factory. The advanced experience of the Zhang Baifa Steel Bar Youth Assault Team in Beijing was quickly promoted, and new production records were created. In the individual competition, young workers Dong Guosong and Liu Dianjia of this team completed 225% and 220% of the daily plan, respectively.

The Tianjin representatives learned more than 1,000 new experiences from the National Conference of Heroes. They will systematically promote them throughout the city.
