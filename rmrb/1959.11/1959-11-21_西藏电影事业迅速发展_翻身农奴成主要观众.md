Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, November 19th: To meet the needs of the broad masses of Tibetan people for cultural life after their emancipation, the film industry in Tibet has developed rapidly. Now, the region has established 72 film projection stations and teams, a threefold increase compared to before the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique launched the rebellion. All major towns have projection stations or teams, and many projection teams conduct mobile screenings in rural and pastoral areas.

In Lhasa, Xigaze, Gyantse, Heihe and other regions, an average of 10 to 12 new films are screened each month. In October alone, there were 437,269 moviegoers. The main audiences for the films are former serfs, slaves, and urban poor.

    西藏电影事业迅速发展  翻身农奴成主要观众
    新华社拉萨十九日电　适应广大藏族人民翻身后对文化生活的需要，西藏地区电影事业迅速发展，现在全区已经建立起七十二个电影放映站和放映队，比西藏上层反动集团发动叛乱前增加了三倍。各主要城镇都有了放映站或放映队，还有许多放映队在农村、牧区进行巡回放映。
    在拉萨、日喀则、江孜、黑河等地区，每月平均各有十部到十二部新影片上映。仅十月份就有观众四十三万七千二百六十九人次，电影的观众主要是过去的农奴、奴隶以及城市贫民。
