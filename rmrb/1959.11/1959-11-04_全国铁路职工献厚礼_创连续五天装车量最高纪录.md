Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd. To present gifts to the National Congress of Heroes, more than two million railway workers across the country are organizing a high-yield transportation ten-day period. In the first five days, from October 26th to 31st, they have already created the highest record for loading volume in a continuous five-day period this year: averaging 40,073 cars loaded per day, exceeding the national plan by more than 5,000 cars in five days. Railway workers in various regions have demonstrated the spirit of combining hard work, practical work, and ingenuity, skillfully loading cars to full capacity and conscientiously organizing incidental transportation. As a result, the average load per freight car during these five days also exceeded the plan by 1.1 tons, saving the country an average of 2,570 operating train cars per day.

The significant achievement of the high-yield transportation ten-day period in the first five days has facilitated the completion of the national railway transportation plan for October ahead of schedule by one day, significantly increasing the transportation volume of major materials such as coke, steel, oil, and cement.

The convening of the National Congress of Heroes has inspired the immensely high production enthusiasm of railway workers across the country, and the number of railway freight car loadings nationwide in October has been continuously rising. After the Ministry of Railways proposed organizing a high-yield transportation ten-day period to present gifts to the Congress of Heroes on October 26th, railway workers in various regions immediately plunged into intense battle. Many railway bureaus held meetings overnight to make arrangements. The train crews of the Xi'an Railway Bureau successfully tested a method of using three locomotives to pull trains on the Baoji to Fengxian section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, where the slope reaches 30‰. Workers from the Mudanjiang Railway Bureau and Nanchang Railway Bureau organized a large number of safe, fast, and over-axle Red Flag trains on railway sections that are relatively difficult to navigate. These have all improved the transportation capacity of the lines.

    全国铁路职工献厚礼
    创连续五天装车量最高纪录
    新华社2日讯　全国二百多万铁路职工为了向全国群英会献礼，正在组织运输高产旬。在10月26日到31日的头五天中，他们已经创造了今年以来连续五天装车量的最高纪录：每天平均装车四万零七十三车，五天共比国家计划多装了五千多车。各地铁路职工发挥苦干、实干、巧干相结合的精神，巧装满载和认真组织捎脚运输，因此在这五天中，每辆货车的平均装载量也比计划多了一点一吨，平均每天为国家节省二千五百七十个运行车皮。
    运输高产旬在头五天取得的这一重大成绩，促使了10月份全国铁路运输计划提前一天超额完成，大大增加了焦炭、钢铁、石油、水泥等主要物资的运输量。
    全国群英会的召开，激发了全国铁路职工无比高涨的生产热情，10月份全国铁路货运装车数不断上升。当铁道部在10月26日提出组织运输高产旬向群英会献礼后，各地铁路职工立即投入了紧张的战斗，许多铁路局连夜召开会议，进行布置。西安铁路局的乘务员，在宝成铁路宝鸡到凤县之间坡度达千分之三十的高坡地带，试验成功了用三个机车牵引列车的方法；牡丹江铁路局、南昌铁路局的职工，在比较难走的铁路区段上，大量组织了安全、快速、超轴的红旗列车；这些都提高了线路的运输能力。
