Xinhua News Agency, New York, 9th. According to the "Worker's Weekly" published on the 8th, Eugene Dennis, Secretary of the National Committee of the American Communist Party, sternly refuted the unreasonable questioning of him by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee last week. Dennis said that the committee should investigate those in the United States who attempt to intensify the Cold War, rather than investigate "political beliefs and associations."

Dennis demanded an investigation into the "conspiracy of the Rockefellers, the military-industrial lobby, and others."

Dennis said that these groups are attempting to "obstruct the end of atomic and hydrogen bomb testing" and "continue the nuclear arming of West Germany." Senator Hruska, a member of the subcommittee, said that the purpose of questioning Dennis was to counteract the atmosphere of "peace and goodwill" that had formed in the United States during Khrushchev's visit to the United States.

Hruska raised dozens of questions about the activities of the American Communist Party in the United States. He asked Dennis about the upcoming American Communist Party Congress and other party affairs. Dennis cited the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and refused to answer these questions.

While refusing to answer the committee's questions about the party and its members as a party leader, Dennis, as an individual, fiercely rebuked Hruska's attempt to smear the role of the Communist Party. Dennis told Hruska that the American Communist Party makes its own decisions based on the interests of the American people.

Dennis said that the American people will take their own path toward socialism. He said that for the American people, socialism will mean peace, economic progress, and prosperity.

In response to a question about the so-called Soviet "threat," Dennis said that he was unaware of any Soviet bases in Canada, Mexico, or Long Island, but he did know that the United States had bases around the Soviet Union.

    丹尼斯严正拒绝参院无理盘问
    要求调查美国好战分子的阴谋
    新华社9日讯　纽约消息：据8日出版的“工人周报”报道，美国共产党全国委员会书记尤金·丹尼斯上星期严正地反驳了参议院国内安全小组委员会对他的无理盘问，丹尼斯说，委员会应该调查美国企图加剧冷战的人们，而不是调查“政治信仰和结社”。
    丹尼斯要求调查“洛克菲勒、军火院外集团和其他人的阴谋。”
    丹尼斯说，这些集团企图“阻挠结束原子弹和氢弹试验”和“继续对西德进行核武装。”这个小组委员会的委员、参议员赫鲁斯卡说，这次盘问丹尼斯的目的是为了抵销赫鲁晓夫访问美国期间在美国形成的“和平和亲善”的气氛。
    赫鲁斯卡提出了几十个关于美国共产党在美国的活动问题，他向丹尼斯提出了即将举行的美国共产党代表大会和党的其他事务问题。丹尼斯引用美国宪法修正案第一条和第五条，拒绝回答这些问题。
    丹尼斯一方面作为党的一个负责人拒绝回答委员会关于党和党员的问题，同时作为个人，他猛烈反击了赫鲁斯卡企图污蔑共产党的作用的做法。丹尼斯对赫鲁斯卡说，美国共产党是根据美国人民的利益作出自己的决定的。
    丹尼斯说，美国人民将采取他们自己的走向社会主义的道路。他说，对美国人民来说，社会主义将意味着和平、经济进展和繁荣。
    丹尼斯在回答关于所谓苏联的“威胁”的问题时说，他不知道苏联在加拿大、墨西哥或长岛有基地，但是他的确知道美国在苏联的周围有基地。
