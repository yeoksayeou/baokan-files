Some Experiences of the Dapu Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Serving Agricultural Production
Huang Shengpu

To do a good job in the supply of agricultural production materials for this winter and next spring, the Dapu Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Hengshan County, Hunan Province, under the leadership of the commune party committee, established an investigation and research group to investigate the needs of the production teams for production materials, made comprehensive plans, and prepared early to ensure that whatever is lacking is supplied, and supplied whenever needed. Now all the autumn harvest tools and the lime, cement, explosives, etc. needed for water conservancy construction are ready.

As early as before the full launch of the "Three Autumns" work, the Dapu Commune Party Committee convened a meeting of the heads of finance and trade, industry and transportation, agriculture and other departments to specifically study the supply of production materials for this winter and next spring. It also established a leading group to support agricultural production, assigning full-time cadres to strengthen leadership. Under the unified leadership of the commune party committee, the commercial departments drew twelve cadres to form two investigation and research groups, going to Daya, Baisha and other brigades with different natural conditions to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth investigation of the characteristics of agricultural production this winter and next spring and the needs of each team for production materials in the next six months. According to their investigation, the production characteristics for this winter and next spring are: one is early. Autumn harvesting, autumn planting, autumn plowing, and winter water conservancy construction will all be one season to one month earlier than last year. The other is big. Whether in mountainous areas or plains, the production tasks for this winter and next spring are greater than in any previous year. For example, the area sown to wheat, rapeseed, vegetables, feed, and green manure this winter will reach more than 27,100 mu, expanding by one to five times compared with last year. As such, the required production materials will also be much greater than in previous years, and must be supplied earlier. According to statistics on autumn harvesting, autumn planting, manure accumulation, autumn plowing and other twenty-three kinds of tools, a total of more than 258,000 pieces are needed, while the existing social stock is only 120,000 pieces, a shortage of 138,000 pieces. The demand for other commercial fertilizers and pesticides will also increase significantly compared with last year.

Based on this situation, the supply and marketing cooperative made comprehensive plans for the variety, quantity, quality, supply time, and supply location of production materials for this winter and next spring. The total value of production materials supplied reached 280,000 yuan, an increase of 21% compared with the same period last winter and spring, with a greater increase in new-style farm tools, old farm tools, seeds, commercial fertilizers, and pesticides.

To realize the plan, they adopted the "five combinations" working method:

1. Combining political command with the proactive organization of support by departments. The first secretary of the commune party committee, Li Zefeng, and the secretary of finance and trade, Liu Yunbin, took charge, organizing the three departments of agriculture, industry, and commerce to be specifically linked. The agricultural department put forward plans, the industrial department produced according to the plans, and the commercial department was responsible for organizing the allocation and supply. Departments cooperated with each other. When the industrial department lacked raw materials, the finance and trade department vigorously supported them. When the finance and trade department needed to organize the supply of farm implements, tools, fertilizers, and pesticides, the industrial department ensured that they were produced on time with the required quality and quantity.

2. Combining self-reliance with purchases from other places. Taking self-reliance as the main approach and purchases from other places as a supplement, continuing to implement the principle of obtaining materials locally, processing locally, and supplying locally, adopting internal allocation and self-repair methods. In this way, of the 258,000 tools needed this winter and next spring, self-repair and self-manufacture within the commune can solve 189,694 pieces; of the 41,000 dan of fertilizer needed, self-built factories can solve 38,000 dan; and for certain farm implements and pesticides for which local raw materials are lacking, they actively purchase from other places. In the past month, the commercial departments have successively purchased 56,600 pieces of baskets, carrying poles, hoe handles, etc., and more than 14,600 jin of seeds from Dong'an, Hengnan and other counties and Mojing, Yanglin and other places in this county.

3. Combining indigenous and foreign methods. The chemical fertilizers and pesticides needed by the whole commune this winter and next spring cannot be met solely by purchases from other places and production using foreign methods. Therefore, the commune decided that in addition to expanding the commune's original chemical fertilizer and pesticide manufacturing plants, it would also strive to establish 25 indigenous fertilizer and indigenous pesticide manufacturing plants in the major brigades using indigenous methods. It was decided to produce 13,000 dan of chemical fertilizer this winter and next spring, and 1,358 dan have already been produced. 30,000 jin of indigenous pesticides are to be produced, and 18,500 jin have already been produced.

4. Combining professionalism with mass participation. The commune's existing agricultural machinery plant and the 25 brigade-run comprehensive farm implement processing plants have a total of 474 professional iron, wood, bamboo, and palm craftsmen. Based on a six-month period, they can only produce 120,000 pieces. More than 22,000 pieces of small farm implements, tools, and rain gear that do not require strong technical skills are resolved by mobilizing the masses to repair and use them themselves. The Qingya brigade was short of more than 9,000 pieces of rain gear, and the brigade party general branch mobilized the masses to weave them in two evenings. Now every laborer has a raincoat and bamboo hat.

5. Combining repair and new manufacture with improvement. According to preliminary estimates, more than 37,000 pieces of farm implements in the entire commune need to be repaired and improved before they can be used. Therefore, while various factories are actively manufacturing new farm implements, the industrial and commercial departments have also organized 25 iron furnaces and 98 carpenters and bamboo craftsmen to go to the countryside to repair and improve old farm implements from door to door, combining this with the manufacture of new ones. To solve the difficulty of insufficient repair craftsmen, iron furnaces have also been established in 169 canteens, and some small items are self-repaired and self-improved.

    大浦供销部为农业生产服务的几点体会
    黄生谱
    湖南省衡山县大浦供销部为了做好今冬明春的农业生产资料供应工作，在公社党委领导下，成立调查研究组，调查生产队对生产资料的需要情况，全面规划，及早准备，做到缺什么供应什么，什么时候需要就什么时候供应。现在秋收工具和兴修水利所需要的石灰、水泥、炸药等全部准备好了。
    早在“三秋”工作全面展开之前，大浦公社党委就召集财贸、工业交通、农业等部门负责人开会，专门研究了今冬明春的生产资料供应工作，并成立支援农业生产领导小组，配备专职干部加强领导。商业部门在公社党委的统一领导下，抽调十二个干部成立两个调查研究组，到青雅、白沙等不同自然条件的大队，对今冬明春农业生产的特点和各队在今后六个月内对生产资料的需要，作了全面深入的调查。根据他们调查今冬明春的生产特点：一个是早。秋收、秋种、秋耕和冬修水利等农活都要比去年提早一个季节到一个月左右。一个是大。不论是山区还是平原，今冬明春的生产任务都比以往任何一年大，例如今冬播种的小麦、油菜、蔬菜、饲料和绿肥等面积就要达到二万七千一百多亩，比去年扩大一至五倍。这样，需要的生产资料也就比往年多，而且要提前供应。据秋收、秋种、积肥、秋耕等二十三种工具统计，共需要二十五万八千多件，而现有社会存量只有十二万件，尚差十三万八千件，其他商品肥料和农药的需要量也将比去年大大增加。
    根据这一情况，供销部对今冬明春的生产资料的品种、数量、质量供应时间、供应地点等，都作了全面规划。供应的生产资料总额达二十八万元，比去冬今春同期增长21％，其中新式农具、旧农具、种籽、商品肥料和农药等增长较多。
    为了实现规划，他们采取“五结合”的工作方法：
    一、政治挂帅与部门主动组织支援相结合。公社党委第一书记黎泽峰与财贸书记刘云彬挂帅，组织为农、工、商三个部门具体挂钩，由农业部门提计划，工业部门按计划生产，商业部门就负责组织调剂供应。部门之间彼此协作，工业部门生产缺原料材料，财贸部门就大力支援，财贸部门需要组织供应的农具、工具、肥料和农药，工业部门就保证如数如质按时生产出来。
    二、自力更生与外地购进相结合。以自力更生为主，外地进货为辅，继续贯彻执行就地取材、就地加工、就地供应的方针，采取内部调剂和自修自制的办法。这样，今冬明春需要的二十五万八千件工具，公社内自修自制就可以解决十八万九千六百九十四件；需要的四万一千担肥料，自己建厂制造也可以解决三万八千担；对某些本地缺乏原料材料的农具农药，就积极向外地采购。近一个月来，商业部门已先后从东安、衡南等县和本县莫井、杨林等地购进箢箕、扁担、锄头柄等五万六千六百多件，种籽一万四千六百多斤。
    三、土洋结合。全公社今冬明春需要的化肥、农药，光靠外地进货和洋办法生产已不能满足需要，于是公社决定除了扩大公社原有的化肥、农药制造厂以外，还争取在各大队办了二十五个用土法生产的土化肥、土农药制造厂。决定今冬明春生产化肥一万三千担，现已生产一千三百五十八担，土农药三万斤，现已生产一万八千五百斤。
    四、专业性与群众性相结合。全公社现有的一个农械厂和二十五个队办农具综合加工厂，共有四百七十四个专业铁、木、篾、棕匠，按六个月的时间算，只能生产十二万来件；还有二万二千多件技术性不强的小农具、工具和雨具，采取动员群众自修自用的方法来解决。青雅大队缺少九千多件雨具，大队党总支发动群众用两个晚上的时间就编织好了，现在每个劳力都有蓑衣斗笠。
    五、修补新制与改良相结合。据摸底全公社现有的农具中有三万七千多件需要修补改良后才能使用。因此在各厂积极制造新农具的同时，工商部门又组织了二十五个铁炉和九十八个木工篾匠下乡串门修补，改良旧农具，结合制造新的。为了解决修补工匠不足的困难，还在一百六十九个食堂建立了铁炉，一些小东西就自修自改。
