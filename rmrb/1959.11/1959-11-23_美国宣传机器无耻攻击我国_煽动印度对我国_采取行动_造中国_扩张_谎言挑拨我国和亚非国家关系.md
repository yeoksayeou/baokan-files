Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd Dispatch from Washington: The United States Information Service (USIS) published on the 18th a so-called "background material" on the Sino-Indian border issue that distorted the truth, viciously attacked China, and tried its best to support the anti-China movement deliberately stirred up by Indian anti-China elements taking advantage of the border incident.

This American official mouthpiece slandered, saying: "The most disturbing aspect of the (Sino-Indian) border dispute has been the issue of Red China's aggressive armed actions." It claimed that the U.S. imperialists held an "unambiguous" attitude in opposing the Chinese people on this issue. The USIS rehashed the slanderous clichés against China issued by the U.S. State Department last week in this so-called "background material."

Although the United States Information Service had to admit that "no Chinese government had signed or ratified (the so-called McMahon Line border treaty)" and admitted that "the United States had no first-hand material" to prove "a properly and clearly defined Sino-Indian border," it also said that Chinese troops stationed within its own border line "violated India's traditional borders" and "occupied territories considered to belong to India."

At the same time, the American bourgeois newspapers published a large number of commentaries and articles, wantonly provoking Sino-Indian relations, inciting India to reject China's proposals and "take action" against China. In this regard, the "New York Times" has always been at the forefront of all American propaganda machines. The "New York Times" has recently and continuously published articles sent back by the newspaper's reporter in New Delhi, clamoring that now "there is the question of whether India is prepared to resist with all military means," and suggested that it should "seek to expand military power as soon as possible from any place possible."

The "New York Times" reporter hinted that Pakistan had already "proposed a joint military defense proposal" to India, and said that it was "appalling" to "express unwillingness to seek assistance in the face of a ruthless enemy." The newspaper also said that Nehru's actions were still very "cautious," "but what is now known is enough to show that he is carefully guarding against falling into any trap set by Beijing."

Some American reactionary newspapers and political figures even shamelessly fabricated rumors that China was going to "expand" to Southeast Asia and the Middle East in order to provoke relations between China and Asian-African countries. "U.S. News & World Report," scheduled to be published on the 23rd, slandered China for using military force to open a so-called "strategic line" in the Himalayas on the border issue. "The Christian Science Monitor" even more shamelessly fabricated the so-called Chinese "armed conquest" against India to intimidate Afghanistan, Burma and Thailand, and even Iran and the Middle East. Former U.S. Ambassador to India, Bowles, slandered that China "will expand to Southeast Asia." The reactionary leader of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), Meany, telegraphed the Indian government to express "full support" for their anti-China movement.

    美国宣传机器无耻攻击我国
    煽动印度对我国“采取行动”
    ?造中国“扩张”谎言挑拨我国和亚非国家关系
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：美国新闻处18日发表了一篇歪曲事实真相的所谓中印边界问题的“背景材料”，恶毒地攻击中国并且竭力支持印度反华分子蓄意利用边界事件掀起的反华运动。
    这个美国官方喉舌污蔑说：“（中印）边境争端最令人不安的方面一直是赤色中国的侵略性的武装行动问题。”它声称美帝国主义者在反对中国人民这一问题上是抱着“毫不含糊的”态度的。美新处在这个所谓“背景材料”中重弹美国国务院上星期发表的诽谤中国的滥调。
    美国新闻处虽然不得不承认“任何中国政府都没有在（所谓麦克马洪线的边界条约）上签署或予以批准”，并且承认“美国没有得到第一手材料”来证明“适当地明确划定的中印边界”。但是它同时又说驻在本国边界线以内的中国军队“侵犯了印度的传统边境”，“占领了认为属于印度的领土”。
    与此同时，美国的资产阶级报刊大量发表评论和文章，肆意挑拨中印关系，煽动印度拒绝中国的建议并对中国“采取行动”。在这方面“纽约时报”一直是美国所有宣传机器中的急先锋。“纽约时报”最近并连续刊登了该报驻新德里的记者发回的文章，叫嚷现在“存在着印度是否准备以一切军事手段来进行抵抗的问题”，献策应当“从任何可能得到的地方尽快地谋求扩大军事力量”。
    “纽约时报”的记者暗示巴基斯坦早已向印度“提出了共同军事防御的建议”，并且说，在“无情的敌人面前表示自己不愿谋求援助”的做法是“令人惊骇”的。这家报纸并且说，尼赫鲁的行动虽然仍然很“谨慎”，“但是现在已经知道的情况足以表明，他在小心翼翼地防备落入北京所设的任何圈套”。
    一些美国反动报刊和政界人物甚至无耻地?造中国要向东南亚和中东“扩张”的谣言，来挑拨中国和亚非国家的关系。预定在23日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”诬蔑中国在边界问题上是使用军事力量在喜马拉雅山区打开所谓“战略线”。“基督教科学箴言报”更无耻地虚构所谓中国对印度的“武装征服”来恫吓阿富汗、缅甸和泰国，甚至伊朗和中东。美国前驻印度大使鲍尔斯诬蔑中国“将会向东南亚扩张”。美国工会的反动头子米尼打电报给印度政府表示“全力支持”他们的反华运动。
