Xinhua News Agency, November 27th, Washington dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles published an article in the November 22nd issue of "Parade" magazine (a weekly supplement to "The Washington Post"), striving to defend the aggressive policies of the United States and its hostile policy towards China.

In his article, Dulles indicated that the U.S. ruling group is deeply worried about the plummeting prestige of the United States abroad. He admitted that "anti-American sentiment" exists in many countries around the world, and that despite the United States' efforts to "explain itself and combat false impressions," the results are often "failures."

Dulles listed many questions raised by "foreigners both inside and outside the United States" to Americans, and admitted that these questions are the "most difficult to answer" for the United States. These questions include: "Why is the United States dragging its feet on discontinuing nuclear testing?" "If you don't intend to start a war, why does the United States threaten the Soviet Union with a string of military bases?" "How can you say you are 'prosperous' when you have millions of unemployed?" "Why do you oppose admitting Communist China to the United Nations?" "Isn't America's prosperity really based on building a huge war machine?" "The Soviets are ahead of you in technology. Why don't you admit it?" "Why doesn't the United States trade with Communist China?"

Dulles said that answering these questions involves "some of the most difficult and complex problems we face today in our foreign relations."

In his answers, Dulles strenuously defended the aggressive stance of the U.S. government, trying to make people believe that the measures taken by the United States to intensify international tension are "justified."

Dulles harped on the old "Cold War" tune, maliciously slandering the Soviet Union as having "aggressive intentions" and pursuing an "expansionist movement," attempting to use this as an excuse for the United States to establish military bases around the world. He even clamored that these bases "are an essential component of the defense of the free world."

Dulles then reaffirmed the U.S. government's hostile stance towards the Chinese people. He defamed China as "an aggressor in Korea" and "not meeting the requirements of the United Nations Charter." Although everyone knows that it was the United States, not China, that launched the war of aggression against Korea and has been obstructing the resolution of the Korean issue. In order to provoke relations between China and other Asian countries, Dulles falsely accused China of harboring "aggressive intentions" towards its neighbors. He also indicated that the U.S. government will continue to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, oppose the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, and continue to implement an "embargo" against China.

Regarding the issue of stopping nuclear testing, Dulles unilaterally emphasized the "issue of supervision," attempting to use this to obstruct the resolution of the issue. In his article, Dulles also tried hard to downplay the United States' lagging behind the Soviet Union in science and technology, and to defend the fact that the U.S. economy largely relies on military production to maintain itself. In order to pour cold water on the American people's desire for peace, Dulles clamored that we "must not expect too much or too soon" for "ending the Cold War."

### 竭力为美国侵略政策辩护  赫脱又弹“冷战”滥调  重申美国政府敌视我国的立场

    竭力为美国侵略政策辩护
    赫脱又弹“冷战”滥调
    重申美国政府敌视我国的立场
    新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿赫脱在22日一期的“行列”杂志（“华盛顿邮报”附送的周刊）上发表一篇文章，竭力为美国的侵略政策和敌视中国的政策辩护。
    赫脱在他的文章中表明，美国统治集团对美国在国外的威信一落千丈感到十分忧虑。他承认，在世界许多国家里存在着“反美情绪”，而且尽管美国竭力想为自己“进行解释和同错误的印象进行斗争”，但结果往往是“失败”的。
    赫脱列举了“美国国内外的外国人”对美国人提出的许多问题，并且承认这些问题是美国“最难回答”的。这些问题包括：“美国为什么在不继续核试验方面采取拖延态度？”“如果你们不打算制造战争，那么美国为什么要用一连串军事基地威胁苏联？”“既然你们有几百万人失业，你们怎么能说你们是‘繁荣’的呢？”“你们为什么反对接纳共产党中国进入联合国？”“美国的繁荣不是真的以建造一架巨大的战争机器为基础的吗？”“苏联人在技术方面超过你们。你们为什么不承认呢？”“美国为什么不同共产党中国进行贸易？”
    赫脱说，对这些问题的答复牵涉到美国政府“今天在我们对外关系中面临的一些最困难、最复杂的问题”。
    赫脱在他的答案中竭力为美国政府的侵略立场辩护，力图使人相信美国推行的目的在于加剧国际紧张局势的措施是“有道理”的。
    赫脱重弹“冷战”滥调，恶意诬蔑苏联“有侵略意图”和推行“扩张主义运动”，企图以此作为美国在世界各地建立军事基地的借口。他并且叫嚷说，这些基地“是自由世界防御的一个必不可少的组成部分。”
    赫脱接着重申美国政府敌视中国人民的立场。他诽谤中国是“在朝鲜的侵略者”，“不符合联合国宪章的各项要求”。虽然大家知道，发动侵朝战争和一直阻挠朝鲜问题解决的正是美国，而不是中国。为了挑拨中国和其他亚洲国家的关系，赫脱诬蔑中国对它的邻国抱有“侵略意图”。他并且表明，美国政府将继续霸占中国的领土台湾，反对恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位，并且继续对中国实行“禁运”。
    谈到停止核试验问题，赫脱片面强调“监督问题”，企图借此来阻挠这个问题的解决。赫脱在文章中还竭力为美国在科学和技术方面落后于苏联解嘲，为美国经济在很大程度上依靠军事生产来维持辩护。为了要给美国人民渴望和平的情绪浇冷水，赫脱叫嚷说，对于“结束冷战”，“我们决不能期望太多或太急”。
