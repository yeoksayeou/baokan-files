Academic and Cultural Trends

    According to a report in the Soviet journal "Foreign Literature," a conference was recently held in Florence, Italy, organized by the editorial boards of several literary and social journals representing different schools of thought. Many prominent Italian writers, literary critics, philosophers, artists, and journalists participated in the meeting. The conference discussed the question: "The Responsibilities of Writers Today."

    Writer Guido Piovene gave a report at the meeting, emphasizing that this issue is closely related to the reality of Italy. He said that the current situation on the cultural front in Italy is "difficult and sinister." He said that there have been significant phenomena of "corruption," "regression," and "reaction" in Italy, but cultural workers have not yet fully countered this dangerous phenomenon. Marxist philosopher Eugenio Garin pointed out in his speech that the current authorities are attempting to impose a culture on Italy that conforms to their ideas and interests. They also oppose this culture to all other schools of thought, denying the latter, and considering the latter to be "tainted" by politics. The ruling group uses radio, television, film, and newspapers to achieve this goal. As a result, the freedom of artistic creation and intellectual freedom are not only increasingly restricted, but will in fact be completely eliminated. Garin said that the weapon used by the reactionary forces to attack Italian culture is that anti-communism paper tiger that has long been torn to shreds.
  
    The conference called on Italian intellectuals to unite closely, to restore the unity of democratic forces in Italian culture of the past on a new basis, that is, the kind of unity that existed during the period of resistance against the enemy and anti-fascist struggle. The conference also issued a resolution, which was signed by about eighty prominent cultural figures.

    意大利著名文化界人士呼吁为保卫民主文化而斗争
    据苏联“外国文学”报道，不久前，在意大利佛罗伦萨市，由几家代表不同流派的文学和社会性杂志编辑部召开了一次会议。参加会议的有意大利的许多著名作家、文学批评家、哲学家、艺术家和新闻记者。会议讨论了这样的一个问题：“目前作家们的职责”。
    作家格维多·波奥维?在会上作了报告，他强调说，这个问题和意大利的现实有极密切的关系。他说，目前意大利在文化战线上所形成的局势，是“艰苦和险恶的”，在意大利，出现了显著的“腐化”、“退步”和“反动”的现象，而文化工作者却至今对于这种危险的现象未予全面的反击。马克思主义者，哲学家埃乌杰尼奥·加林在发言中指出，目前当权者企图以符合他们的思想和利益的那种文化加于意大利，还把这种文化同其他的一切流派对立，并且否定后者，认为后者是受了政治的“熏染”。统治集团借助于广播、电视、电影和报纸等来达到他们的这种目的。结果艺术创作的自由和理智的自由不但越来越受到限制，而且实际上将被完全消灭。加林说，反动势力用以进攻意大利的文化的武器，就是那只早已撕破了的反共产主义的纸老虎。
  会议号召意大利知识分子紧密团结起来，在新的基础上恢复过去意大利文化中的民主力量的团结，即在抗敌和反法西斯斗争时期所有的那种团结。会议并发表了决议，在决议上签名的有著名的文化界人士约八十人。
