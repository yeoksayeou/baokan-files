Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods Sparks Innovation: Small Coal Mines Display Great Power
　　Shandong's Small Coal Pits Exceed the Province's Total Raw Coal Output in 1953
　　Small Coal Mines in Heilongjiang Province Produce Over Four Million Tons of Coal in Ten Months
　　The Output of Small Coal Kilns in Ningxia Generally Doubles After Renovation
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 16th: Shandong Province's small coal kilns completed their annual task of producing 3.78 million tons of raw coal more than fifty days ahead of schedule. This figure exceeds the province's total raw coal output in 1953.
　　Due to the consistent implementation of the "walking on two legs" policy, Shandong Province's small coal kilns have seen significant improvement and development in the past year. At the beginning of this year, the average daily output was only over 8,500 tons; after vigorous rectification and renovation, the current average daily output has increased to over 15,800 tons, nearly doubling the daily output at the beginning of the year. In the process of rectifying and renovating small coal kilns, various localities opposed right-leaning tendencies, boosted enthusiasm, and the labor enthusiasm of the masses was unprecedentedly high. Employees put forward tens of thousands of rationalization proposals. Many major technological innovations have been realized, making small coal kilns develop from indigenous to foreign methods. Currently, among the province's 159 pairs of mines, 12 pairs are standard mines, 64 pairs are semi-indigenous and semi-foreign, and 83 pairs use indigenous production methods. The level of mechanization in the mines is also constantly improving, and production capacity is continuously increasing. For example, the daily output of Kongzhuang Coal Mine in Yixian County has reached over 1,000 tons, completing the annual state plan three months ahead of schedule.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 16th: Small coal kilns in Heilongjiang Province are demonstrating great power. From January to October, small wells and small coal kilns directly under the province's coal mines produced 4.09 million tons of coal; city and county coal mines built and expanded last year produced 1.13 million tons of coal. The rapid growth in the coal output of small coal kilns has played an important role in achieving a continued leap forward in coal production this year.
　　This year, Heilongjiang Province has carried out a series of rectification and renovation work on small coal kilns, so that these small coal kilns, which were started with indigenous methods, have continuously developed in the direction of foreign-style mines, and their production capacity has been rapidly improved. Up to now, 106 pairs of small mines in the province have planned for renovation, 28 pairs of mines have become mechanized mining mines, and 42 pairs of small wells are stepping up the installation of mechanical equipment. While increasing equipment, all mines have also strengthened the technical management and production management of small wells, and promoted regular mining methods. Employees of small coal kilns have also launched a vigorous mass movement to engage in technical innovation and technical revolution, which has further promoted the renovation and equipment work of small coal kilns. After the renovation of 56 small coal kilns in the Lingdong Mine of Shuangyashan, the daily output since October has reached more than 1,200 tons, an increase of nearly two times compared with the daily output level at the beginning of the year. Jianchang Coal Mine in Muleng County has reached a monthly output of 20,000 tons of raw coal.
　　Our newspaper, Yinchuan, 16th: The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is launching a vigorous upsurge in the technical renovation of small coal kilns. At present, more than 60% of the small coal kilns in the region have basically eliminated the heavy labor of carrying coal and carrying water, and have realized the winch for hoisting, the vehicle for transportation, and the pump for drainage, thereby greatly improving production efficiency.
　　There are more than 120 small coal kilns in the Ningxia area, and their products account for more than one-third of the region's total raw coal output. Most of these small coal kilns were established last year during the mass steelmaking campaign using indigenous methods. In the first quarter of this year, the Autonomous Region Coal Industry Administration put forward the task of renovating small coal kilns. It required self-reliance, from indigenous to foreign, using local materials, engaging in mass movements, and implementing technical renovations. In the process of renovation, many coal mines established technical innovation committees composed of party and government leaders, technicians, and veteran workers, led by the party committee secretary, held forums, and created idea-offering platforms, forming a hot wave of everyone offering ideas and everyone contributing suggestions. In the New Well Coal Mine of Ningsuo County, more than 100 employees put forward 132 rationalization proposals within nine days, vigorously engaging in indigenous mechanization. After this coal mine realized indigenous mechanization, it increased water pumping efficiency tenfold and transportation efficiency eightfold. The small coal kilns renovated throughout the region generally use windlasses, steam winches, wooden carts, animal-powered carts, and trolleys to replace human carrying of coal in hoisting and transportation. In ventilation and drainage, various methods such as mechanical ventilation, electric pumping, and water pumps are adopted. Generally, coal output has increased by more than one time.
　　At the recently held first representative meeting of advanced producers in the autonomous region, representatives of the coal industry system assured the Party: strive to completely eliminate the backward state of human carrying of coal in small coal kilns before the end of the year, and fully realize indigenous mechanization of hoisting, transportation, and drainage.　(Xie Shiyan)

    土洋结合闹革新　小煤井显大威风
    山东小窑煤超过1953年全省原煤总产量
    黑龙江省的小煤井十个月产煤四百多万吨
    宁夏经过改造的小煤窑产量一般都翻一番
    据新华社济南16日电　山东省的小煤窑提前五十多天完成了全年生产三百七十八万吨原煤的任务。这个数字超过了1953年全省原煤总产量。
    由于坚持贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，山东省的小煤窑一年来有了显著的提高和发展。今年年初平均日产量只有八千五百多吨；经过大力整顿和改造，现在的平均日产量已经增至一万五千八百多吨，比年初的日产量提高近一倍。各地在整顿改造小煤窑的过程中，反右倾，鼓干劲，群众的劳动热情空前高涨。职工提出了成千上万条合理化建议。实现了许多重大技术革新，使小煤窑由土到洋的发展起来。现在全省一百五十九对矿井中，正规井有十二对，半土半洋的六十四对，土法生产的八十三对。矿井的机械化水平也不断提高，生产能力不断上升。如峄县孔庄煤矿日产量已能达到千吨以上，提前三个月完成了全年国家计划。
    新华社哈尔滨16日电　黑龙江省的小煤窑生产大显威风。在1至10月份里，全省直属煤矿的小井和小煤窑产煤四百零九万吨；去年兴建和扩建的市、县煤矿产煤一百一十三万吨。小煤窑煤炭产量的迅速增长，对实现今年的煤炭生产继续跃进起了重要作用。
    今年，黑龙江省对小煤窑进行了一系列的整顿改造工作，使这些土法上马的小煤窑不断向洋井方向发展，生产能力提高的很快。到目前为止，全省已有一百零六对小矿井对改造进行了规划，有二十八对矿井变成了机械化采掘的矿井，还有四十二对小井正在加紧安装机械设备。在增加设备的同时，各矿还加强了小井的技术管理和生产管理，推行了正规的采掘方法。小煤窑职工还开展了轰轰烈烈的大搞技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，进一步推动了小煤窑的改造和装备工作。双鸭山岭东矿五十六个小煤窑经过改造后，10月以来日产量达到一千二百多吨，比年初日产水平增长了将近两倍。穆棱县碱场煤矿已经达到月产两万吨原煤的水平。
    本报银川16日电　宁夏回族自治区正在掀起一个轰轰烈烈的小煤窑技术改造高潮。目前，全区已有60％以上的小煤窑基本上消灭了背煤、担水的笨重劳动，实现了提升绞车化，运输车子化，排水抽子化，从而大大提高了生产效率。
    宁夏地区的小煤窑共一百二十余处、其产品约占全区原煤总产量的三分之一强。这些小煤窑大多数是去年大办钢铁运动中用土办法建立的。今年第一季度，自治区煤炭工业管理局就提出了改造小煤窑的任务。要求自力更生，由土到洋，就地取材，大搞群众运动，实行技术改造。在改造过程中，许多煤矿都成立了由党政领导、技术人员、老工人参加的技术革新委员会，由党委书记挂帅，举行座谈会，搞献计台，形成了人人献计、个个献策的热潮。宁朔县新井煤矿，在九天内，一百多名职工就提出了一百三十二条合理化建议，大搞土机械化。这个煤矿在实现土机械化以后，提高抽水效率十倍，提高运输效率八倍。全区改造后的小煤窑，在提升和运输方面，一般采用辘轳、汽绞车、木车、畜力车、小推车代替人背煤，在通风和排水方面，采取机械通风、电力抽水、水抽子等各种办法，一般煤产量都提高一倍以上。
    在最近举行的自治区第一次先进生产者代表会上，煤炭工业系统的代表向党保证：争取年底前在小煤窑上全部消灭人背煤的落后状态，全面实现提升、运输、排水土机械化。　（谢石言）
