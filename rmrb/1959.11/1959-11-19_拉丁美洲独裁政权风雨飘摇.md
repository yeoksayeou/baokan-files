　　Latin American Dictatorships Rocked by Storms
　　Nicaraguan People's Armed Forces Strike
　　Paraguayan Opposition Parties Boycott Sham Elections
　　Dominican Underground Struggle Active
　　Haitian Financial Situation Continues to Deteriorate
　　(Comprehensive Dispatch) In the four dictatorial countries of Nicaragua, Paraguay, Dominican Republic, and Haiti in Latin America, the people's resistance is intensifying and the domestic economic situation is deteriorating.
　　In Nicaragua, Enrique Lacayo Farfán, leader of the armed struggle against Nicaraguan dictator Luis Somoza, recently told reporters in San José, the capital of Costa Rica, that "the struggle is still ongoing" in Nicaragua. He said that there are currently 170 soldiers under the command of Julio Alonso fighting against the National Guard in the northern mountains of Segovia. On the afternoon of November 9, Alonso's troops attacked a National Guard patrol near Quibuto, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers.
　　In exposing Somoza's promise to hold elections as a fraud, Lacayo Farfán pointed out that "the Nicaraguan Liberation Movement was formed to destroy the dictatorship and fight for the establishment of a new government system. The Nicaraguan people will not believe Somoza's promises, because the policies of this family, since the time of that Somoza who died in prison (Note: refers to Luis Somoza's father, Anastasio Somoza, who was assassinated in September 1956), have consistently used deception to buy time from the Nicaraguan people."
　　According to other reports, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Alfredo Vargas formally protested to the Nicaraguan government on the evening of the 14th against the Nicaraguan army's cross-border attacks and violations of Costa Rican territory.
　　Costa Rican political figures pointed out that the Nicaraguan army's invasion was a conspiracy planned by Nicaraguan dictator Somoza, with the aim of requesting the Organization of American States to intervene in the increasingly high anti-dictatorial struggle in Nicaragua.
　　In Paraguay, various opposition parties oppose the election fraud perpetrated by the Stroessner dictatorship.
　　According to reports, the Liberal Party and the February Party (both of which have representatives participating in the Paraguayan National Liberation United Front established in Uruguay) have formally decided not to send representatives to the "Central Election Committee," which is preparing for the parliamentary elections scheduled for February 1960.
　　The "Paraguayan Unity News" recently published a commentary exposing Stroessner's election fraud, pointing out that the purpose of this election fraud is, on the one hand, to give the reactionary police and military dictatorship the appearance of a "legal" government, and at the same time to obstruct the people's united struggle, leading the people away from the path of national liberation and democratic revolution.
　　The newspaper pointed out that the new election law was "cooked up in the US Embassy," and that it prohibits the Paraguayan Communist Party from participating in the elections.
　　The newspaper also exposed the Paraguayan government's so-called gradual "normalization of the system." The newspaper pointed out that Stroessner's aim is to divide the masses, prevent the increasingly high people's struggle, and ensure the granting of concessions to US oil monopolies.
　　In its commentary, the "Paraguayan Unity News" called on all national, democratic, and anti-imperialist forces to unite and form a broad patriotic front in order to overthrow the pro-American dictatorship.
　　In the Dominican Republic, according to the "New York Times," the serious deterioration of the economic situation in the Dominican Republic in the first six months of this year threatens Trujillo's dictatorship. The newspaper pointed out that due to the growing dissatisfaction of the people, Trujillo is greatly increasing military spending in an attempt to consolidate his rule. In the first half of 1959 alone, the Trujillo government spent as much as 50 million US dollars in this area. The newspaper pointed out that these expenses exceeded half of the Dominican Republic's budget this year.
　　The dictator is negotiating a 40 million US dollar foreign loan to make up for the increasing balance of payments deficit caused by huge military expenditures.
　　The cost of living in this country is constantly rising. The newspaper pointed out that from June to October, the cost of living in the capital increased by 20%. The newspaper emphasized that the domestic situation in the Dominican Republic is unfavorable to Trujillo, and underground activities against Trujillo are increasingly being carried out.
　　In Haiti, due to the control and plunder of American capital, the financial and economic situation continues to deteriorate.
　　According to the "New York Times" on November 7, Haitian dictator Duvalier announced at a press conference on November 6 that Haiti's fiscal expenditure for the fiscal year ending at the end of September 1959 was 33.6 million US dollars, with insufficient fiscal revenue to cover this amount. It was only because the United States allocated 6 million US dollars to Haiti from the International Cooperation Administration that the revenue and expenditure were balanced. The Haitian government also borrowed 5.5 million US dollars from the "International Monetary Fund" with the guarantee of saving government expenditures.
　　Duvalier said at the press conference that new taxes will be levied to make up for next year's deficit. He said that next year's fiscal budget expenditure is 27.8 million US dollars. The new donations and taxes will mainly be income tax. Secondly, consumer goods such as cigarettes, alcohol, automobiles, gasoline, canned goods, and high-end foods will all be taxed. The transit tax on some bridges will also be restored. It is estimated that the total amount of new donations and taxes will reach 1 million to 1.5 million US dollars.
　　Faced with serious financial difficulties, the dictatorial regime in this country is preparing to further rely on the United States. Duvalier openly announced that the Haitian government has entrusted American government experts and the Cleary Shack Company in Washington to jointly study a long-term plan to reform Haiti's finances.

    拉丁美洲独裁政权风雨飘摇
    尼加拉瓜人民武装出击
    巴拉圭反对党抵制伪选
    多米尼加地下斗争活跃
    海地财经情况不断恶化
    本报综合报道　在拉丁美洲的尼加拉瓜、巴拉圭、多米尼加和海地四个独裁国家中，人民的反抗日益激烈，国内的经济情况日益恶化。
    在尼加拉瓜，反对尼加拉瓜独裁暴君路易斯·索摩查武装斗争的领导人恩里克·拉卡约·法尔方最近在哥斯达黎加首都圣约瑟向新闻记者发表谈话说，在尼加拉瓜“斗争仍在继续进行”。他说，目前有一百七十名战士在胡利奥·阿隆索的指挥下，在塞哥维亚北部山区对国民警卫队展开斗争。11月9日下午，阿隆索的部队在基布托附近袭击了一队国民警卫队的巡逻队，杀伤敌人多人。
    拉卡约·法尔方在揭露索摩查答应举行选举的骗局时指出，“尼加拉瓜解放运动的形成是为了摧毁独裁制度，并为建立一个新的政府制度而斗争。尼加拉瓜人民不会相信索摩查的诺言，因为这个家族的政策，从当了死囚的那个索摩查（按：指路易斯·索摩查的父亲安纳斯塔肖·索摩查，他在1956年9月被刺身死）的时候起，就一贯是用欺骗尼加拉瓜人民的办法来争取时间。”
    另据报道，哥斯达黎加外交部长阿尔弗雷多·瓦加斯14日晚正式照会尼加拉瓜政府，抗议尼加拉瓜军队的越境袭击和侵犯哥斯达黎加领土的行为。
    哥斯达黎加政界人士指出：尼加拉瓜军队的入侵活动是尼加拉瓜独裁者索摩查策划的一项阴谋，它的目的是企图要求美洲国家组织对尼加拉瓜日益高涨的反独裁斗争进行干涉。
    在巴拉圭，各反对党反对斯特罗斯纳独裁政权所玩弄的选举骗局。
    据报道，反对党自由党和二月党（这两个政党的代表都参加了在乌拉圭成立的巴拉圭民族解放联合阵线）已经正式决定不派代表出席“中央选举委员会”，这个选举委员会筹备预定在1960年2月举行的议会选举。
    “巴拉圭团结报”最近发表评论揭露斯特罗斯纳的选举骗局时指出，这次选举骗局的目的一方面是给反动的警察和军事独裁政权披上“合法”政府的外衣，同时用以阻挠人民的团结斗争，使人民离开民族解放和民主革命的道路。
    这家报纸指出，新的选举法是“在美国大使馆里泡制出来的”，这个选举法禁止巴拉圭共产党参加选举。
    报纸还揭露了巴拉圭政府的所谓逐步进行“体制正常化”的把戏。报纸指出，斯特罗斯纳的目的是要分裂人民群众，阻止日益高涨的人民斗争，并保证给予美国石油垄断组织租让权。
    “巴拉圭团结报”在评论中号召一切民族、民主和反帝国主义力量团结起来，形成广泛的爱国阵线，以便推翻亲美的独裁政权。
    在多米尼加，据“纽约时报”报道，多米尼加共和国今年头六个月经济情况的严重恶化威胁了特鲁希略的独裁政权。报纸指出，由于人民日益增长的不满，特鲁希略正在大量增加军费以设法巩固他的统治地位。仅在1959年上半年，特鲁希略政府花在这方面的钱就达五千万美元之多。报纸指出，这些费用超过了多米尼加共和国今年预算的一半。
    独裁者在进行一笔四千万美元国外贷款的谈判，以便弥补由于巨大的军费开支而造成的日益增多的支付平衡赤字。
    这个国家的生活费用在不断的上涨。报纸指出，6月到10月，首都的生活费用增长了20％。报纸强调说，多米尼加的国内形势对特鲁希略是不利的，反对特鲁希略的地下活动正在日益开展。
    在海地，由于美国资本控制和掠夺，财政经济情况不断恶化。
    据11月7日“纽约时报”报道，海地独裁者杜瓦利埃于11月6日在记者招待会上宣称，海地到1959年9月底为止的财政年度的财政支出为三千三百六十万美元，财政收入不足此数，由于美国从国际合作总署拨出了六百万美元给海地，才使收支平衡。海地政府并以节约政府开支为保证向“国际货币基金组织”借到了五百五十万美元。
    杜瓦利埃在记者招待会上说，将用征收新税办法，来弥补下年度赤字。他说，下年度财政预算支出为二千七百八十万美元。新捐税将以所得税为主。其次是对消费品如香烟、酒类、汽车、汽油、罐头、高级食品，都将征税。若干桥梁的过境税也将恢复。估计新增捐税总额将达一百万至一百五十万美元。
    面对着严重的财政困难，这个国家的独裁政权准备进一步投靠美国。杜瓦利埃公开宣布，海地政府已委托美国政府专家和华盛顿的克利恩·沙克公司共同研究改革海地财政的长远计划。
