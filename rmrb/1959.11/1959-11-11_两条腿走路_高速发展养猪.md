    Developing Hog Raising at High Speed by "Walking on Two Legs"
    Hengshan Brigade of Tangfang Commune in Jiangxi, and a Production Team of Tantou Commune in Yunnan, Vigorously Develop Pig Farms
    Experience Shows that the Key is that the Party Committee and Branch Take the Lead, Unifying Thinking, Clarifying the Guiding Principles, Establishing Organizations, and Implementing the Responsibility System
    (Compiled News from this Newspaper) Public raising as the mainstay, private raising as a supplement, implementing the policy of walking on two legs, hog raising can develop at high speed. Hengshan Brigade of Tangfang Commune in Guangchang County, Jiangxi Province, implemented this policy and raised a total of 4,410 hogs. After internal sales and external transfers, the current stock of hogs is 1,871, of which public raising accounts for 61%, with more than one hog per mu of field. The second production team of Huaqiu Management District, Tantou Commune, Daguan County, Yunnan Province, implemented this policy, and the number of hogs increased from 320 to 1,024 in ten months, an increase of more than two times. Public raising accounts for 75%, with an average of 4.1 hogs per household.

    (According to a report from Jiangxi Daily) Hengshan Brigade of Tangfang People's Commune in Guangchang County, Jiangxi Province, has rapidly developed hog production. By the end of September, a total of 4,410 hogs were raised. After transferring out and selling internally 2,539 heads, the current stock of hogs is 1,871, of which publicly raised hogs account for 61% of the total number of hogs raised. The entire brigade has 1,865 mu of cultivated land, with more than one hog per mu of field.

    The large-scale development of hog production has effectively promoted the bumper harvest of agricultural production. This year, the amount of pig manure applied to early rice per mu reached 121 dan, an increase of 12.8% compared to last year. At the same time, it has also greatly increased the income of commune members. The total hog raising income of the brigade reached 27,541 yuan, accounting for 56% of the total agricultural income of the team.

    When the commune put forward the resounding slogan of "one hog per mu of field" at the beginning of this year, the vast majority of cadres and masses of the brigade were confident in achieving this requirement. However, some cadres and masses said that "collective hog raising is not good and affects agriculture is not worth it"; "one hog per mu of field" is "the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak, and the hog raising plan will fall through." In response to these erroneous ideas, the Party branch promptly organized a big airing, big contending, and big debate from inside the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses. By presenting the facts and reasoning, right-leaning sentiments were criticized. At the same time, the masses calculated the three accounts of hog raising (the account of accumulating manure to increase production, the account of increasing income for commune members, and the account of supporting national construction), and educated the masses with vivid facts, so that the broad masses of commune members clarified the benefits and great prospects of "one hog per mu of field" and strengthened their confidence. In order to make the movement deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and create momentum, the brigade also held a rally, loudly put forward the slogan of "one hog per mu of field, a bumper harvest of both hogs and grain," and boosted the morale of the commune members.

    At the beginning, there was a shortage of hog sources, lack of funds, and pigsty equipment could not keep up with the development needs. The Party branch mobilized the masses to raise more sows in a planned way to achieve self-sufficiency in breeding. The whole team raised a total of 163 sows. When funds were insufficient, commune members were mobilized to invest collectively, reaching 12,810 yuan, plus national loan assistance, which solved the difficulty of insufficient funds. When the pigsties could not keep up with the development needs, they tried to use idle old houses, building them simply and crudely. The whole team built 845 pigsties for the twelve collective pig farms.

    In order to open up sources of feed, the Party branch mobilized the masses to find more than 20 kinds of green fodder. At the same time, commune members were given a small amount of private plots to mobilize commune members to plant feed and establish feed bases, and were given a certain amount of feed grain according to regulations.

    In addition, the Party branch also paid close attention to the business management issues in collective hog raising, and generally adopted the feeding management system of earthen-walled small pens, dividing groups and pens. At the same time, commune members who were politically reliable and had certain hog raising experience (more than 90% are female labor force, of which 20% are Party and League members) were selected as breeders, and the responsibility system was implemented to strengthen management.

    (According to a report from Yunnan Daily) The second production team of Huaqiu Management District, Tantou People's Commune, Daguan County, Yunnan Province, comprehensively implemented the policy of combining public and private raising, and hog production has greatly developed. The number of hogs increased from 320 at the end of 1958 to 1,024, an increase of more than two times; the average number of hogs per household is 4.1, of which about three-quarters are collectively raised by the production team.

    In February of this year, the Party branch of the management district earnestly summed up the past experience in hog raising and clarified that developing collective raising is the foundation for developing hog production. They established and improved the organizational structure of the breeding team. The production team established a hog raising command post, the production team established a breeding group, and the production team arranged fifteen people to specifically manage hog raising, establishing a one-line hog raising organization to specifically lead hog raising.

    In order to give full play to the enthusiasm of the breeders, the production team formulated reasonable work point quotas and promoted the three guarantees (guaranteed breeding, guaranteed feed, guaranteed fertilizer) and four fixes (fixed fatness, fixed out-of-stall time, fixed feed quantity, fixed rewards and punishments) method. At the same time, the method of raising more sows and timely mating was used to solve the problem of hog sources. The whole production team raised 75 sows in 1958, and now it has increased to 154.

    In addition to using wild plants as feed, they also made full use of all agricultural by-products as feed, using corn cobs, rice bran, bean leaves, bean dregs, etc. The team established a feed processing plant to process various feeds for feeding pigs. In addition, the whole team also planted melons and vegetables in cornfields, and recently planted more than 420 mu of radishes and cabbage, and plans to store all sweet potato vines for winter feed.

    After taking the above measures, not only has the collective hog raising of the production team developed, but also the private hog raising of commune members has also developed. The entire production team raised a total of 1,024 hogs, with an average of 4.1 hogs per household, most of which are collectively raised. The pigs raised privately by commune members average more than one head per household.

    集体饲养为主  公养私养并举
    “两条腿走路”高速发展养猪
    江西塘坊公社横山大队、云南滩头公社一个生产队大办养猪场
    经验是党委和支部挂帅、打通思想、明确方针、建立机构、实行责任制
    本报综合消息  公养为主、私养为辅，执行两条腿走路方针，养猪就能高速度发展。江西省广昌县塘坊公社横山大队执行了这个方针，共养生猪四千四百一十头，除内销外调外，目前存栏生猪有一千八百七十一头，公养占百分之六十一，每亩田已有一头多猪。云南省大关县滩头公社花秋管理区第二生产队执行了这个方针，十个月生猪从三百二十头发展到一千零二十四头，增加二倍多，公养占百分之七十五，平均每户有四点一头。
    据江西日报消息　江西省广昌县塘坊人民公社横山大队生猪生产迅速发展，到9月底止，共养生猪四千四百一十头，除外调、内销二千五百三十九头以外，目前存栏生猪有一千八百七十一头，其中公养猪占到养猪总数61％。全大队有耕地一千八百六十五亩，每亩田已超过了一头猪。
    由于生猪生产的大发展，有力地促进了农业生产的丰收。今年早稻每亩施猪肥量达到一百二十一担，比去年增产12.8％。同时，也使社员大大地增加了收入。全大队的养猪收入达二万七千五百四十一元，占了全队农业总收入的56％。
    当今年年初公社提出“一亩田一头猪”的响亮口号时，大队的绝大部分干部和群众都有信心实现这一要求。但是，也有部分干部和群众说什么“集体养猪搞不好，影响农业划不来”；“一亩田一头猪”，是“心有余而力不足，养猪计划会落空”。党支部针对这些错误思想，及时组织了由党内到党外、由干部到群众的大鸣、大放、大辩论。通过摆事实，讲道理，批判了右倾情绪。同时在群众中算了养猪三笔账（养猪积肥增产账、社员增加收入账、支援国家建设账），以活生生的事实教育了群众，使广大社员明确了“一亩田一头猪”的好处和远大前途，坚定了信心。为了使运动深入人心，造成声势，大队又召开了誓师大会，响亮地提出了“一亩田一头猪，生猪粮食双丰收”的口号，鼓舞社员的斗志。
    开始猪源不足，资金缺乏，猪栏设备跟不上发展需要。支部就发动群众有计划地多养母猪，做到自养自繁，全队共养了母猪一百六十三头。资金不足，便发动社员集体投资达一万二千八百一十元，加上国家贷款扶助，解决了资金不足的困难。猪栏赶不上发展需要，便尽量利用空闲旧屋，因陋就简修建，全队为十二个集体养猪场修建了八百四十五个猪栏。
    为了开辟饲料来源，支部发动群众先后寻找到了二十余种青饲料，同时，又给社员少量自留地，发动社员栽种饲料，建立饲料基地，并按规定给予一定的饲料粮。
    此外，党支部对集体养猪中的经营管理问题也抓得非常紧，普遍采取了土栏小圈、分群分栏的饲养管理制度，同时，挑选政治可靠和有一定养猪经验的社员（90％以上是妇女劳动力，其中有20％是党团员）担任饲养员，实行责任制，加强了管理。
    据云南日报消息　云南省大关县滩头人民公社花秋管理区第二生产队，全面地贯彻执行公养私养并举的方针，养猪生产有了很大发展。养猪头数从1958年底的三百二十头增加到一千零二十四头，增加二倍多；每户平均有猪四点一头，其中生产队集体饲养的占四分之三左右。
    今年2月，管理区党支部认真总结了过去养猪的经验，明确了发展集体饲养，是发展养猪生产的基础。他们建立和健全了饲养队的组织机构。生产队成立了养猪指挥所，生产小组成立了饲养组，生产队安排了十五个人专管养猪，建立了一条线的养猪机构，具体领导养猪。
    为了充分发挥饲养员的积极性，生产队制定了合理的工分定额，推行了三包（包繁殖、包饲料、包肥料）、四定（定膘、定出槽时间、定饲料数量、定奖惩）的办法。同时，用多养母猪，及时配种的办法来解决猪源问题。全生产队1958年养母猪七十五头，现在增加到一百五十四头。
    他们除了利用野生植物作饲料外，还充分利用一切农作物的副产品作饲料，把包谷芯、谷糠、豆叶、豆糠等利用起来。队上建立了饲料加工厂，加工各种饲料喂猪。另外，全队还在包谷地里普遍种上了瓜菜，最近又种了四百二十多亩萝卜、白菜，并计划把红薯藤全部贮藏起来留作冬饲料。
    采取以上措施以后，不但生产队的集体养猪发展了，社员私人养猪也有了发展。整个生产队共养猪一千零二十四头，平均每户有猪四点一头，其中大部分是集体饲养的，社员私人养的猪平均每户有一头多。
