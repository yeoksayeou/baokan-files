	(Our newspaper’s dispatch from Taiyuan, November 11th) In Yanggao County, Shanxi Province (near the ancient Great Wall), the “Everyone Red Diligent Skillful” competition has developed to a new stage—a competition where collective production units improve together and prosper together. This competition has become a powerful driving force for all farmers in Yanggao County to strive for a good harvest this year and promote agricultural production preparations for 1960.
	This competition developed from the "Everyone Red Diligent Skillful" competition launched in June of this year. After the Great Leap Forward in production last year and the establishment of the People's Communes, the people of Yanggao County launched the "Red Diligent Skillful" competition, with everyone striving to be the best and catching up with the advanced. The labor efficiency of commune members increased by 25% compared with the same period last year, and the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture was better implemented. Therefore, a great summer harvest was achieved, with the total wheat output increasing by about one-fold compared with last year. However, the "poor and blank" state has not been fundamentally changed. The broad masses of commune members are eagerly demanding a rapid change in their poor and backward state. The rich desire to become richer, and the poor desire to catch up with the rich; the advanced desire to become more advanced, and the backward desire to catch up with the advanced. People's desire is to better carry out socialist construction and develop agricultural production at high speed. The Yanggao County Party Committee actively supported the masses' demands and put forward the slogan "Everyone Red Diligent Skillful, Everywhere Catch Up and Surpass High" (Catch up means poor areas catch up with rich areas, disaster years catch up with good harvest years, backward catch up with advanced; Surpass means measures exceed targets, enthusiasm exceeds measures, labor exceeds quotas; High means construction at high speed, work of high quality, production of high income), and organized the strength of the masses to carry out the competition. In the movement, the County Party Committee first grasped the backward areas as it grasped the advanced, and sent more than 160 cadres to strengthen the leadership work in these areas. And according to the specific situation, in the "Catch up, Surpass, High" competition, the following priorities were put forward: The 190 management areas with an average income of less than 40 yuan per person should focus on the poor catching up with the rich; the 39 lightly affected disaster areas and 19 heavily affected disaster areas should focus on disaster years catching up with good harvest years; the 76 management areas with slow progress and backward production should focus on launching mass movements and backward catching up with advanced. In leading this competition movement, the County Party Committee adhered to putting politics in command, constantly using the spirit of the Party's General Line to arm the broad masses of cadres and commune members, and using the vivid examples of the pace-setters to educate the broad masses. In the "Catch up, Surpass, High" competition, oppose right-leaning conservatism, oppose pessimism and discouragement, go all out, aim high, and strive for a bumper harvest, which greatly stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members. Currently, a lively situation of "eight immortals crossing the sea, each showing their unique abilities" has emerged throughout the county. Fourteen thousand people have broken the quota, and those whose work efficiency has doubled account for 6.8% of the total labor force. The erroneous idea of "work points first" of some people in the past has been transformed into "quality first." During the county-wide grand competition on May 1st, the work that met the quality standards accounted for 95%; in the "July 1st" grand competition, it rose to 98%. People who used to "pick and choose" have now become active elements who "do whatever work is available." People who used to advocate "keeping more and eating more" have now turned to supporting "selling more surplus grain," and the summer grain purchase task has been overfulfilled by 50%. After three grand competitions, 1,800 advanced collective pace-setters and more than 17,000 pace-setters have emerged throughout the county. These units and individuals are the vanguards in the competition movement, and are the sparks that have changed from "a little bit of red" to "a little bit of red everywhere" and "all-around red."
	The vigorous "Red Diligent Skillful, Catch up and Surpass High" movement has given full play to the superiority of the People's Commune of "Larger Size and Higher Degree of Public Ownership" and promoted the rapid development of production. This summer, some areas of the county suffered severe drought and flood disasters. However, in the "Catch up, Surpass, High" competition, the people in these areas put forward the bold fighting slogan: What is lost must be recovered; light disaster areas should achieve high yields and exceed quotas, and heavy disaster areas should maintain production and increase income. Over the past few months, while fighting the disaster to protect seedlings, they have also vigorously engaged in diversified operations, and as a result, they have realized their bold promise. The total autumn grain area in the county is more than 1.5 million mu, and the average yield per mu has increased by 9% compared with last year; the total income of agricultural and sideline industries in the county has increased by 22.6% compared with the same period last year. Of the 190 management areas with an average income of less than 40 yuan per person, 108 have greatly exceeded 40 yuan, and some have even reached 60 to 70 yuan. The remaining management areas have decided to break through the 40 yuan mark this year. Forty-five backward areas have become advanced areas. Among the disaster areas, 39 light disaster areas have become bumper harvest areas of varying degrees, and 12 of the 19 heavy disaster areas have become income-increasing areas, and the rest have changed from heavy disaster areas to light disaster areas.

    阳高“红勤巧”运动有新发展
    百多个管理区由穷变富　几十个灾区增加收入
    穷区赶富区，灾年赶丰年，落后赶先进；
    措施超指标，干劲超措施，劳动超定额；
    建设高速度，做活高质量，生产高收入。
    本报太原11日电　山西省阳高县（在古长城边）的“人人红勤巧”竞赛，发展到了一个新的阶段——集体生产单位之间共同提高，共同富裕的竞赛。这个竞赛已经成为阳高县全体农民争取今年丰收和推动1960年农业生产准备工作的强大动力。
    这个竞赛是在今年6月开展的“人人红勤巧”竞赛中发展起来的。去年生产大跃进和人民公社成立以后，阳高全县人民开展了“红勤巧”竞赛，人人争上游，个个赶先进，社员劳动效率比去年同期提高了25％，八字宪法得到更好的贯彻，因此，获得夏季大丰收，小麦总产量比去年约增长一倍。但是，“一穷二白”的面貌，还没有从根本上改观。广大社员急不可待地要求迅速改变穷困落后面貌。富裕的要求更加富裕，穷的要求赶上富的；先进的要求更加先进，落后的要求赶上先进。人们这种愿望就是要更加搞好社会主义建设，高速度发展农业生产。中共阳高县委积极支持了群众这种要求，提出了“人人红勤巧，处处赶超高”（赶，就是穷区赶富区，灾年赶丰年，落后赶先进；超，就是措施超指标，干劲超措施，劳动超定额；高，就是建设高速度，做活高质量，生产高收入）的口号，把群众的力量组织起来，开展竞赛。在运动中，县委首先像抓先进一样地去抓落后，给穷区和落后区派去了一百六十多名干部加强了这些地区的领导工作。并根据具体情况，在“赶、超、高”竞赛中，提出了如下的重点：每人平均收入在四十元以下的一百九十个管理区，以穷赶富为主；遭受自然灾害的三十九个轻灾区和十九个重灾区，以灾年赶丰年为主；各项工作进展缓慢，生产落后的七十六个管理区，以大搞群众运动，落后赶先进为主。县委在领导这个竞赛运动中，坚持了政治挂帅，不断用党的总路线精神去武装广大的干部和社员，用标兵们的生动事例去教育广大群众。在“赶、超、高”竞赛中，反对右倾保守，反对悲观泄气，鼓足干劲、力争上游、夺取丰收，大大激发了广大社员的劳动积极性。当前，全县已经出现了一个“八仙过海，各显神通”的生动活泼的局面。有一万四千人突破了定额，工效提高一倍的人占到总劳力的6.8％。过去部分人的“工分第一”的错误思想一转而为“质量第一”。“五一”节，全县大评比时，合乎质量标准的活计占95％；“七一”大评比，便上升为98％。过去“挑肥拣瘦”的人，今天一转而为“见活就干”的积极分子。过去主张“多留多吃”的人，一转而为赞成“多卖余粮”，夏粮征购任务超额50％完成了任务。经过三次大评比，全县涌现出一千八百个先进集体标兵，和一万七千多名标兵。这些单位和个人，是竞赛运动中的尖兵，是由“一点红”变为“点点红”、“全面红”的火星子。
    如火如荼的“红勤巧，赶超高”运动，充分发挥了人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，促进了生产的迅速发展。今年夏季，这个县部分地区遭受了严重的旱涝灾害。但是，在“赶、超、高”竞赛中，这些地区的人民提出了豪迈的战斗口号：丢了的要夺回来；轻灾区高产超收，重灾区要保产增收。几个月来，一面抗灾保苗，一面大抓多种经营，结果实现了自己的豪迈的诺言。全县秋粮总面积一百五十多万亩，平均亩产比去年增长9％；全县农副业总收入，比去年同期增长22.6％。每人平均收入在四十元以下的一百九十个管理区，已经有一百零八个大大超过了四十元，有的甚至达到了六十元至七十元，其余的管理区决定在今年内突破四十元大关。四十五个落后区变成了先进区。灾区中，三十九个轻灾区变成了程度不同的丰收区，十九个重灾区有十二个变成了增收区，其余的由重灾区变成了轻灾区。
