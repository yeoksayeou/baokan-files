Small Aluminum Plant Scores Again

The workers of the Zhengzhou Small Aluminum Plant have recently achieved great results in production again. They overfulfilled the production plan in October.

In order to produce more metallic aluminum for the country, the plant strengthened its technical management in October and lowered the cell voltage, opening more than ten additional electrolytic cells compared to September, thereby increasing aluminum production.

Currently, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is holding an on-site meeting in Zhengzhou to organize the exchange of experiences from the Zhengzhou Small Aluminum Plant in high yield, high quality, and low cost, in order to further improve the production level of small aluminum plants.

    小铝厂再次告捷
    郑州小铝厂的职工最近在生产上又取得很大成绩。10月份超额完成了产量计划。
    为了给国家多生产金属铝，这个厂10月份由于加强了技术管理，降低了槽电压，比9月份多开了十多个电解槽，因此又提高了铝的产量。
    目前，冶金部正在郑州召开现场会议，组织交流郑州小铝厂高产、优质、低成本的经验，以进一步提高小铝厂的生产水平。
