    Two or Three Things About Peace Doves
    Xiang Fu
    In the azure sky, a flock of snow-white doves is flying, their gentle whistling sound floating over the workshops and fields where people are working diligently. What a beautiful picture, harmonious music, and happy labor!

    The Chinese people have always loved raising pigeons. Since the Tang Dynasty, there have been many records about pigeons. The Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio even has a touching story dedicated to pigeons – “The Pigeon Anomaly” – which reflects the importance our people place on pigeon breeding.

    As for using pigeons to symbolize peace, there is a beautiful myth behind it. It is said that in ancient times, there was a great flood. Noah and his family sailed in an ark, floating on the vast and boundless floodwaters. In order to find land, one day, they released a dove. In the evening, the dove returned with a freshly plucked olive leaf. They knew that land was about to appear, the disaster was over, and a peaceful and happy life would begin again. From then on, the dove, along with the olive branch it carried, became a symbol of peace.

    In fact, even without this myth, using pigeons to symbolize peace is most appropriate. The dove’s appearance is so beautiful, full, and symmetrical. Whether it is walking or flying, it appears so steady and serene, free and agile. The dove’s feathers are generally snow-white or light gray, colors that represent purity, simplicity, tranquility, and humility. Doves are gentle and warm in nature, and they always get along very well with each other, especially the mutual loyalty and love between couples, which is well-known.

    Before mating, the male and female doves coo and sing to each other, expressing their love; after mating, they take turns incubating the eggs and share the hard work together; when one dove is incubating, the other hovers nearby, singing softly, as if comforting their beloved's hard work.

    They also carefully raise and care for their offspring. After the chicks hatch, the parent doves regurgitate a kind of oily secretion – called "pigeon milk" – from their crops to feed them. Once their offspring have grown feathers, they take them out to learn to fly and find food.

    Doves are also very particular about hygiene; they always keep their feathers clean, and their rooms are also often very tidy.

    Doves can deliver messages for people; they can reliably transmit your friendship to your friends in distant places. It is said that even if a dove is taken to a distant place in a tightly covered cage, it can fly back. Some say this is because they have an innate ability to discern directions.

    Therefore, from any perspective, using pigeons to symbolize peace is most appropriate. Today, peace has become the unanimous call of all progressive people around the world. Let our peace doves fly high, fly all over the world!

    和平鸽二三事
    祥夫
    在蔚蓝色的天空里，一群雪白的鸽子在飞翔，它们柔和的哨声，飘浮在紧张劳动着的工场、田野的上空。这是多么美丽的图画、谐和的音乐、幸福的劳动啊！
    我国民间向来都喜欢养鸽。自唐代以来就有着不少关于鸽子的记载。聊斋志异上还有一篇专以鸽子为题材的动人故事——“鸽异”，它体现了我国民间对养鸽事业的重视。
    至于用鸽子来象征和平，那是有着一段优美的神话的。据说：在太古时候，曾经发生过一次洪水。挪亚和他的全家乘坐着一只方船，飘浮在茫茫无际的洪水上。为了找寻陆地，有一天，他们把鸽子放了出去。晚上，鸽子含了一枝新摘下的橄榄叶子回来了。他们便知道前面要出现陆地，灾难过去了，和平幸福的生活又开始了，从此以后，鸽子，连同它摘过的橄榄叶，便成了和平的象征。
    其实，即使没有这一段神话，用鸽子来象征和平，也是再合适不过的。鸽子的外形是那样优美、丰满而匀称。它不论是在走路或者是在飞翔，都显得那样稳重而又安详，自在而又灵便。鸽子的羽毛一般雪白或者浅灰，这是纯洁、朴素、平静而谦和的颜色。鸽子的性情温和而热情，同伴之间总是相处得很融洽，特别是夫妇之间的互相忠诚和友爱，是很出名的。
    在生育之前，雌雄鸽子咕咕咕地唱和着，互相倾诉爱恋之情；在生育以后，轮流伏卵孵雏，共同分担辛勤的劳作；当一只鸽子在孵卵的时候，另一只便在它身边徘徊照料，咕咕地低声歌唱，似乎是在慰问爱侣的辛勤。
    它们对待子女也是细心抚养，爱护备至的。当小鸽子出壳后，亲鸽便从嗉囊里吐出一种油脂性的分泌物——叫做“鸽乳”——来哺育它们。一旦子女羽翼长成，便带它们出去学习飞翔和觅食。
    鸽子也很讲究卫生，它们总是把羽毛修饰得很干净，它们的房间也常是很清洁的。
    鸽子能替人们传信，它们能负责地将您的友情传送给您远方的朋友。据说，即使把鸽子关在严密遮盖的笼子里带到远方去，它也能够飞回来。有的人说这是因为它们天生有一副惊人的分辨方向的能力。
    所以，无论从哪方面来看，用鸽子来象征和平是再合适不过的了。今天，和平已经成为全世界进步人类一致的呼声。让我们的和平鸽高高地飞，飞遍全世界吧！
