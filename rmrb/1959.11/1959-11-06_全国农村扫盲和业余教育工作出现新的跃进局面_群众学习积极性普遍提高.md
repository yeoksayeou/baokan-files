Xinhua News Agency, November 5th. After opposing rightism and boosting morale, a new leap forward has emerged in the national rural literacy and spare-time education work. Currently, a massive mass learning movement is gradually unfolding under the leadership of the Party committees of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. The masses' enthusiasm for learning has generally increased, and the enrollment rate continues to rise. In provinces and autonomous regions such as Fujian, Yunnan, Gansu, Henan, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia, the enrollment rate of young and middle-aged farmers in general areas has reached 60% to 70%, and in some areas it has reached over 80%. According to incomplete statistics, the number of young and middle-aged farmers enrolled in the country has reached approximately 50 million.

Since the beginning of autumn, Party committees and education departments in various regions have, in accordance with the spirit of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, reviewed the progress of literacy work in the previous stage, affirmed the achievements of literacy work over the past year, and also criticized the right-leaning and slackening thoughts in literacy work in the previous period. The Provincial Committees and Provincial People's Committees of Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Hebei and other provinces jointly issued instructions requiring literacy cadres and the broad masses to resolutely overcome right-leaning thoughts and slackening emotions, and to take advantage of the favorable period of this winter and next spring, combined with the current movement to increase production and practice economy and the characteristics of production, to immediately launch a vigorous literacy movement and a new upsurge in carrying out spare-time education. The Education Departments, Provincial Committees of the Communist Youth League, and Provincial Women's Federations of Gansu, Yunnan, Jilin, and other provinces have also jointly issued notices on "Opposing Rightism, Boosting Morale, and Vigorously Carrying Out Literacy and Spare-Time Education Work." The Yunnan Provincial Committee recently convened an on-site meeting on farmer literacy and spare-time education in Wenshan County, attended by representatives from five prefectures (special districts) and thirty-eight counties, to exchange experiences. The Henan Provincial Committee recently made unified arrangements for literacy work and other work at a meeting of three-level cadres. After the Fujian Provincial Committee issued instructions to the whole province through a telephone conference to combine production and vigorously promote literacy, eleven counties including Nanping, Youxi, and Lianjiang held mobilization rallies to advance towards culture, and the number of students enrolled in the province quickly reached more than 2.4 million. The number of students enrolled in the Nanping Special District reached more than 80% of the planned number and is gradually becoming consolidated. The number of farmers enrolled in Guangdong Province reached 2.3 million, doubling the number before the summer harvest. In Linxi County, Inner Mongolia, after the Autonomous Region Party Committee convened a literacy and spare-time education broadcast conference, leading party and government cadres took the lead in vigorously grasping literacy and spare-time education. At present, 96% of the county's young and middle-aged people are participating in literacy classes and spare-time school studies. In Kedong County, Heilongjiang Province, spare-time learning activities have been universally carried out in 133 management districts, and the enrollment rate of young and middle-aged people has reached 91%. In Zhoushan County, Zhejiang Province, 70% of young and middle-aged fishermen actively participate in learning; many communes also set up arenas and carry out literacy competition and evaluation activities, setting off a wave of mass enthusiasm for learning culture.

In the process of carrying out mass literacy and spare-time education movements in rural areas, various regions are giving prominence to politics, led by Party committees, closely integrated with production, with diverse teaching forms, and teaching content generally includes politics, culture, and technology simultaneously.

Jiang Ru姊, deputy secretary of the 14th Brigade branch of Zhouzhuang People's Commune, Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, used to be illiterate. Thanks to persistent and regular cultural studies, she can now read county newspapers and write simple letters. Therefore, she was selected as a learning model in Jiangyin County.

    全国农村扫盲和业余教育工作出现新的跃进局面
    群众学习积极性普遍提高
    新华社5日讯　全国农村扫除文盲和业余教育工作，经过反右倾、鼓干劲，出现了新的跃进局面。目前，一个声势浩大的群众学习运动，正在各省、市、自治区党委的领导下逐步展开。群众学习积极性普遍提高，入学率不断增加。福建、云南、甘肃、河南、山西、辽宁、吉林、内蒙古等省、自治区青壮年农民入学率，一般地区达60％到70％，部分地区已达80％以上。据不完全统计，全国青壮年农民入学人数已达五千万人左右。
    入秋以来，各地党委和教育部门根据党的八届八中全会决议精神，检查了前一阶段扫盲工作情况，肯定了一年来的扫盲成绩，同时也针对前一时期扫盲工作中的右倾、松劲思想，进行了批判。陕西、江苏、河北等省委和省人民委员会联合发出指示，要求扫盲干部和广大群众坚决克服右倾思想和松劲情绪，利用今冬明春的有利时期，结合当前增产节约运动和生产特点，立即掀起一个轰轰烈烈的扫盲运动和开展业余教育的新高潮。甘肃、云南、吉林等省教育厅、共青团省委、省妇联等单位也联合发出“反右倾、鼓干劲、大力开展扫盲和业余教育工作”的通知。云南省委最近在文山县召开了五个州（专区）、三十八个县的农民扫盲和业余教育现场会议，交流经验。河南省委最近在三级干部会上，把扫盲和其他工作作了统一安排。福建省委通过电话会议向全省发出结合生产、大搞扫盲的指示后，南平、尤溪、连江等十一个县，召开了向文化进军的誓师大会，全省入学人数迅速达到二百四十多万人。南平专区入学人数达到计划人数的80％以上，并逐步走向巩固。广东省农民入学人数达二百三十万人，比夏收前增加了一倍。内蒙古林西县在自治区党委召开扫盲和业余教育广播大会后，由党政领导干部挂帅，大抓扫盲和业余教育。目前，全县96％的青壮年都参加了扫盲班和业余学校学习。黑龙江省克东县一百三十三个管理区已普遍开展了业余学习活动，青壮年入学率达91％。浙江舟山县有70％的青壮年渔民积极参加学习；许多公社还摆擂台，开展扫盲竞赛评比活动，掀起了群众学文化的热潮。
    各地农村在开展群众性扫盲和业余教育运动中，政治挂帅，党委领导，紧密结合生产，教学形式多种多样，教学内容一般是政治、文化、技术同时进行。
