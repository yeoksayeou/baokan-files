Budapest, November 10th (Reported by this newspaper) - Factories and enterprises throughout Hungary have successively proposed to designate November as "Month for Welcoming the Party Congress," "Month of Glorious Achievements," or "Month of Technical Innovation" ... to welcome the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party to be held on November 30th. The broad masses of workers are exerting their energy and contributing their talents to strive to overfulfill the tasks dedicated to the congress, complete the annual plan ahead of schedule, and ensure that the main production targets stipulated in the Three-Year Plan for 1960 are achieved this year.

    Miners in Tatabánya have decided to complete the annual coal production plan this month. The Dorog Coal Mine United Enterprise guarantees to overfulfill the plan dedicated to the congress and to achieve the 1960 production targets one year ahead of schedule.

    The Csepel Iron and Steel Works originally planned to increase steel production by 4,000 tons by the end of the year, but by the end of October, 3,000 tons had already been completed. Now, the target dedicated to the congress has been raised from 4,000 tons to 5,000 tons. Workers at the Ózd and Góbányá Iron and Steel Works, displaying wisdom and energy, have now increased labor productivity to the level originally planned for 1960. They are also preparing to go further and strive to increase it by another 4% by the end of the year.

Budapest, November 10th (Reported by this newspaper) - To welcome the Seventh Congress of the Socialist Workers' Party scheduled to be held on November 30th, the primary-level party organizations, districts, states, and the city of Budapest throughout Hungary have recently held party representative conferences to summarize the work of the past three years, formulate future tasks, and elect new leading bodies.

    According to the "People's Freedom Newspaper" report on the party representative conferences in various places, the party organizations, reorganized in the process of fighting against the counter-revolutionaries, strictly implemented the basic principles of Lenin's party life, strengthened the combat effectiveness and leadership role of the party organizations, and enjoyed high prestige among the masses. The secretary of the Csepel Iron and Steel Works Party Committee pointed out in the summary report made at the factory's party representative conference: "The party members of the Iron and Steel Works resolutely implemented and executed the party's policies. Although the number of party members has been reduced by half compared with before the counter-revolutionary events of 1956, the prestige and influence of the party organization have greatly increased."

    The party representative conferences in various places seriously summarized the experience of fighting against counter-revolutionaries. Over the past three years, party organizations in various places have conducted serious struggles against revisionism and various bourgeois viewpoints on the ideological front, and improved the political and ideological level of party members and the political awareness of the broad masses. The resolutions of the party representative conferences in Budapest and various states all pointed out that in the future, it is necessary to further strengthen Marxist-Leninist ideological education, continue to deepen the struggle against revisionism and various bourgeois viewpoints, and at the same time continue to pay attention to overcoming sectarianism and dogmatism.

    The party representative conferences in various places pointed out that great achievements have been made in socialist construction in factories and rural areas. In particular, after the Party Central Committee issued the call to accelerate socialist construction in March this year, a vigorous labor competition was launched throughout the country, and triumphant reports came frequently.

    Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, great victories have also been achieved in the socialist transformation of agriculture and the improvement of agricultural production over the past three years. Large-scale socialist management (including state-owned farms) is now being implemented on 51% of the country's cultivated land. A large number of agricultural production cooperatives organized this spring have been gradually consolidated and production has been increased.

    The Party Central Committee's instructions on the "Seventh National Congress" and the Second Five-Year Plan are a great encouragement to all party members and the people of the whole country. According to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, party organizations in various places have planned future work and production targets. Party members have expressed their willingness to set an example and lead the masses to actively accelerate socialist construction.

    各地党组织总结工作经验制定新的工作规划
    本报布达佩斯10日电　匈牙利全国各工厂企业都纷纷提出把11月份作为“迎接党的代表大会月”、“辉煌成绩月”或“技术革新月”……来迎接本月30日召开的匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会，广大职工正在发挥干劲，各献其能，争取超额完成献礼任务，提前完成年度计划，保证今年就实现三年计划规定的1960年的主要生产指标。
    托托巴尼奥的矿工决定本月就完成全年的产煤计划；多罗格煤矿联合企业保证超额完成献礼计划和提前一年实现1960年的生产指标。
    切佩尔钢铁厂原定到年终超额增产钢四千吨，但到10月底已完成了三千吨，现在又把献礼指标由四千吨提高为五千吨。奥兹德和戈巴尼钢铁厂的职工们，发挥智慧和干劲，现在已把劳动生产率提高到原定1960年的水平，他们还准备再进一步，要争取到年底再提高4％。
    本报布达佩斯10日电　为迎接定于本月30日召开的社会主义工人党第七次代表大会，匈牙利全国各地党的基层组织，各区、州和布达佩斯市，最近都举行了党代表会议，总结三年来的工作，制定今后的任务，并选出新的领导机构。
    “人民自由报”关于各地党代表会议的报道表明，在同反革命进行斗争的过程中重新组织起来的党组织，严格贯彻了列宁的党内生活的基本原则，党组织的战斗力和领导作用加强了，在群众中享有很高的威信。切佩尔钢铁厂党委书记在工厂党代表会议上所作的总结报告中指出：“钢铁厂的党员坚决贯彻和执行了党的政策，虽然党员人数比1956年反革命事件以前减少一半，但党组织的威信和影响却大大增长了。”
    各地的党代表会议都认真总结了同反革命斗争的经验。三年来各地党组织在思想战线上同修正主义和形形色色的资产阶级观点进行了严肃的斗争，提高了党员的政治思想水平和广大群众的政治觉悟。布达佩斯和各州的党代表会议的决议都指出，今后要进一步加强马克思列宁主义的思想教育，继续深入地开展反对修正主义和各种资产阶级观点的斗争，同时也继续注意克服宗派主义和教条主义倾向。
    各地的党代表会议指出，工厂和农村在社会主义建设方面都取得了很大的成就，特别是今年3月党中央委员会发出加速社会主义建设的号召后，全国展开了轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛，胜利的捷报频频传来。
    由于党的正确领导，三年来在农业社会主义改造和提高农业生产方面也取得了很大的胜利。现在在全国51％的耕地上实行着社会主义性质的大规模经营（包括国营农场），今春组织起来的大批农业生产合作社已逐渐巩固，提高了生产。
    党中央关于“七大”和第二个五年计划的指示，对全体党员和全国人民是一个极大的鼓舞。各地党组织都根据党中央的指示，规划了今后的工作和生产指标。党员都纷纷表示要以身作则，带动群众，来积极加速社会主义建设。
