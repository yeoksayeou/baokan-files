Seeking Balance in High-Speed Development
Yang Jianbai

The General Line is a Model of Skillfully Combining High-Speed Socialist Development with Proportionate Development

The ability of the national economy to develop both at high speed and proportionally is an objective law of socialist construction and a manifestation of the enormous superiority of the socialist system. The work of comprehensive balancing of the national economy serves the high-speed, proportionate development of the socialist economy, and in the current stage of our country, it serves the general line of socialist construction. Right-leaning opportunists attack the Great Leap Forward of last year and this year, clamoring about "disproportionate development of the national economy," saying that the national economy can only develop "proportionately" and not at high speed, wanting a kind of "speed that does not break the balance." This is a complete misinterpretation of comprehensive balancing. In fact, speed and proportion are not completely separate. Marxist theory of reproduction does not talk about static, unchanging proportions apart from the speed of development, but examines proportional relationships from the movement of development. The development of the national economy is always a process of contradiction and struggle between balance and imbalance, proportion and disproportion, constantly abandoning the old balance and forming a new balance. The essence of right-leaning opportunists wanting a "speed that does not break the balance" is to oppose high speed and the Great Leap Forward, thereby negating the Party's general line for socialist construction.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "The issue of construction speed is the most important issue facing us after the victory of the socialist revolution." The Party's general line for building socialism and the complete set of policies of walking on two legs are all aimed at rapidly developing social productive forces and enabling China's national economy to achieve high-speed development. This high-speed development does not violate the requirement of proportionate development, but strives for balance in high-speed development. Balance is also not detrimental to high-speed development. On the contrary, on a certain material basis, the more the various parts of the national economy conform to or approach the proportions required objectively, the more the entire national economy can advance at high speed. Our general line for socialist construction and the policy of walking on two legs are based on the objective laws of social production development and are a creative application of Marxist theory of reproduction. It is a model of skillfully combining high-speed socialist development and proportionate development from a strategic perspective. The realization of the Great Leap Forward in China's national economy since 1958 precisely proves that the general line and a set of policies of walking on two legs are completely correct.

Observing whether the proportional relationships of the national economy are adapted or maladjusted should be examined from the perspective of global, fundamental proportional relationships. As long as heavy industry develops at the fastest speed with priority, agriculture and light industry also develop at high speed, and the people's living standards, first and foremost the living standards of workers and peasants, are improved, there will be no long-term, global disproportion in the national economy, and the political relationship of the worker-peasant alliance will inevitably become increasingly consolidated. As for the fact that in practical work, some specific indicators are too high or too low, resulting in incompatibility between individual links of the national economy, it is indeed difficult to avoid, but it is completely different in nature from global, fundamental disproportion.

A concrete analysis must be made of the emergence of imbalances and uncoordinated phenomena. According to the viewpoint of dialectics, balance is relative and temporary, while imbalance is absolute and constant. Therefore, even if one strives subjectively to achieve balance, imbalances will always appear, not to mention that the subjective reflects the objective, and can only generally conform to the objective reality, and cannot conform to the objective reality 100%. In the development of the national economy, there is often the existence of individual weak links. Most of these imbalances are caused by natural or historical conditions and cannot be resolved in a short period of time. As for consciously relaxing some minor aspects in order to complete a major economic task, resulting in some individual and temporary uncoordinated phenomena, that is precisely a dialectical treatment of the overall situation and the local situation, and is not a mistake or shortcoming in the work.

It is necessary to correctly recognize that the work of comprehensive balancing of the national economy is to determine the proportional relationships between the various parts of the national economy in the context of high-speed development. It is neither just wanting proportion and ignoring speed, nor just wanting speed and disregarding proportion. The Party Central Committee has always attached importance to the work of balancing the national economy. This pragmatic balance, after comprehensive analysis, is essentially different from the negative balance and mechanical balance with right-leaning conservative thinking. We have always persisted in correct comprehensive balancing and will make it increasingly scientific. Right-leaning opportunists are only using comprehensive balancing as a guise to spread the germs of right-leaning opportunism. Therefore, we must conduct a serious struggle against them and not allow them to swindle and pass off fish eyes as pearls.

The task of comprehensive balancing of the national economy is to comprehensively reflect the inevitability of the interrelationship and mutual restriction of various basic factors in the process of expanded reproduction through the index system of the national economic balance sheet. As far as planning work is concerned, it is to allocate resources—manpower, material resources, and financial resources—among the various departments of the national economy in proportion during the process of expanded reproduction, based on social needs, through calculation, comparison, and research, so that needs are adapted to resources, and manpower, material resources, and financial resources maintain mutually adaptive proportions. It goes without saying that the above-mentioned proportional allocation is based on the policies and guidelines of the Party and the state, and at the same time, it must take into account the key and the general, the present and the future, and carry out a reasonable allocation of productive forces among various regions.

Agriculture is the foundation of national economic development, and it is necessary to combine the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture, and strengthen industrial support for agriculture. Now let's talk about the necessity of comprehensive balancing.

1.  Regarding the development relationship between heavy industry and agriculture and light industry. The Party Central Committee has proposed that under conditions where heavy industry is given priority development, the development of industry and agriculture should be carried out simultaneously, and the development of heavy industry and light industry should be carried out simultaneously. This policy has made clear and scientific arrangements for the relationship between the three, and at the same time, it deeply reflects the principle of the proportional relationship between the two major categories in Marxist theory of reproduction.

Marxist theory of reproduction shows that while the first category is given priority development, the second category must also develop proportionally. From the perspective of the physical content of social production, the proportional relationship between the two major categories is consistent with the proportional relationship between heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture. Industry and agriculture are the two major material production departments. All social material wealth is created from these two departments. Therefore, maintaining an appropriate proportion between heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture fundamentally solves the proportional relationship between the production of means of production and the production of consumer goods, these two major categories. The strategic deployment made by the Party Central Committee regarding the development relationship between China's heavy industry and agriculture and light industry is based on China's actual situation, proceeding from a comprehensive point of view, proceeding from the point of view of development and connection, grasping the main contradictions of the national economy, and placing them in their proper positions, so that they are both in their proper places and adapt to each other. This will not only fully mobilize the enthusiasm of 650 million people and greatly accelerate the speed of China's socialist construction, but also ensure that the entire national economy does not experience global, long-term proportional imbalances.

The work of comprehensive balancing of the national economy is to first make practical arrangements for the construction scale and production indicators of heavy industry, agriculture, and light industry according to the strategic deployment of the Party Central Committee and the political and economic tasks of each planning period. In order to achieve high-speed development of the socialist economy and continuous improvement of labor productivity, and in order to equip all sectors of the national economy with modern science and technology, the policy of giving priority development to heavy industry is undoubtedly unwavering. However, we are not developing heavy industry for the sake of developing heavy industry. The ultimate purpose of heavy industry development is nothing more than to improve the people's living standards. Therefore, the development of heavy industry must serve the entire national economy, and first and foremost, serve agriculture. Only in this way can we better implement the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously under the conditions of giving priority development to heavy industry. Marx said: "The productivity of agricultural labor that exceeds the individual needs of laborers is the basis of all social production." He also said: "The less time society needs to produce wheat and livestock, etc., the more time it has to carry out other production—material and spiritual production." It can be seen how important agricultural production is in the national economy. Especially in China's specific situation, agriculture is the foundation of national economic development, and it promotes the development of all departments of the national economy. Only by rapidly developing agriculture while giving priority to the development of heavy industry can the great strides forward in socialist industrialization be free from worries. Therefore, the development of heavy industry must first focus on supporting agriculture in order to better implement the strategic policy of promoting industry and agriculture simultaneously. Moreover, only by strengthening industrial support for agriculture, accelerating the mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification of agriculture, and accelerating the improvement of agricultural labor productivity, can the state obtain more grain and various foods, more raw materials for light industry, and more accumulated funds from the agricultural sector, and be able to free up more labor from the agricultural sector to be transferred to the industrial sector. All of this depends on arrangements through comprehensive balancing.

2.  Regarding the issue of production construction and people's livelihood. The economic essence of this issue is how to distribute and use national income in terms of accumulation and consumption. Accumulation and consumption are based on means of production and means of consumption as their physical content. Therefore, the proportional relationship between the two major categories is the premise of the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption. The Party's policy on production construction and people's livelihood is to take overall consideration and make appropriate arrangements, that is, to continuously improve people's lives on the basis of continuously increasing production and improving labor productivity. How is this policy concretized in the practice of the planned economy? During the planning period, the total amount of national income is limited. If more is used in accumulation, less will be used in consumption; and vice versa. Experience has proven that as long as the national income has high-speed growth and the people's lives have necessary improvements, a higher accumulation rate will not cause a disproportionate relationship between accumulation and consumption. In order to correctly determine the proportion of accumulation and consumption, and to ensure that production construction has high-speed development without affecting the necessary improvement of people's living standards, it is necessary to use comprehensive balancing to draw relatively accurate conclusions.

3.  Regarding the issue of promoting large, medium, and small enterprises simultaneously and adopting both foreign and indigenous methods. In the process of production construction, modern large-scale industries, especially certain heavy industries, need to continuously extract means of production and labor for a longer period of time, and before they are put into production, they do not provide any effective products. Some other enterprises, such as small and medium-sized enterprises using simple production methods, or certain light industries, not only extract means of production and labor multiple times a year, but also continuously provide new means of production and means of livelihood. The former type of enterprises generally belong to the economic lifeline of socialist construction, and it is impossible not to engage in this type of construction. However, the construction of this type of enterprise is slower, the investment is larger, and the time to realize investment benefits is longer. Therefore, the Party Central Committee has determined the policy of promoting large, medium, and small enterprises simultaneously and adopting both foreign and indigenous methods simultaneously under the conditions of taking modern large enterprises as the key link. This can extensively and comprehensively mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, fully utilize all possible conditions, rapidly improve the level of production, and greatly accelerate the speed of socialist construction. However, what proportion should large, medium, and small enterprises and foreign and indigenous methods occupy to be beneficial to both today and tomorrow? This also depends on comprehensive balancing.

4.  Regarding the comprehensive development of regional economies. China is a vast, multi-ethnic country, and the legacy left to us by old China is that modern industry is concentrated in the coastal areas. In order to promote the comprehensive development of regional economies, the Party Central Committee has determined the policy of promoting central and local industries simultaneously, appropriately arranging the relationship between coastal and inland industries, and striving to develop the economies of minority areas under the conditions of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor, and cooperation.

Regional economic activities are intertwined with multiple aspects, such as the relationship within the region, the relationship between the central government and the local government, and the relationship between regions. The wealth created by a region is not all used in the region; and the wealth used locally is not all created locally. Between the local and foreign areas, there is not only the transfer of materials and currencies carried out according to the principle of equivalent exchange; there is also the net transfer of funds and material products between the central government and the local government due to the transfer of financial credit funds; and there is a series of complex connections between the net transfer (surplus or deficit) of finance, credit, and material products. All of this depends on observation and arrangement through comprehensive balancing.

In summary, it can be seen that comprehensive balancing work is a major issue related to the entire economic life and the correct handling of contradictions among the people, rather than a simple technical issue.

The high-speed and proportionate development of the socialist economy is an objective requirement. In order to correctly reflect this objective requirement, planning work must use comprehensive balancing as a basic method. Let us hold high the red banner of the general line of socialist construction and strive to accelerate the Great Leap Forward of China's national economy, to improve the level of economic science, and to improve the level of national economic planning and management!

    在高速度发展中求平衡
    杨坚白
    总路线是把社会主义的高速度发展和按比例发展巧妙结合起来的典范
    国民经济既能高速度又能按比例地发展，是社会主义建设的客观规律，也是社会主义制度的巨大优越性的表现。国民经济综合平衡工作是为社会主义经济的高速度、按比例发展服务的，在我国现阶段，就是为社会主义建设总路线服务的。右倾机会主义分子攻击去年和今年的大跃进，大喊“国民经济比例失调”，说什么国民经济只能“按比例”的发展，而不可能高速度的发展，要一种“不打破平衡的速度”。这完全是对于综合平衡的曲解。事实上速度和比例并不是截然分开的。马克思主义的再生产理论不是离开发展速度来谈什么静止的、不变的比例，而是从发展运动中来考察比例关系的。国民经济的发展永远是一个平衡和不平衡，合比例和不合比例的矛盾斗争过程，它总是不断的扬弃旧的平衡，又形成新的平衡。右倾机会主义分子要一种“不打破平衡的速度”，其实质就是不要高速度，不要大跃进，从而否定党的社会主义建设的总路线。
    刘少奇同志在党的八大二次会议上指出：“建设速度的问题，是社会主义革命胜利后摆在我们面前的最重要的问题。”党的建设社会主义的总路线，一整套两条腿走路的方针，都是为了迅速地发展社会生产力，使我国国民经济达到高速度发展。这种高速度发展，并不违反按比例发展的要求，而是在高速度发展中力求平衡。平衡也不是不利于高速度发展的，相反地在一定的物质基础上，国民经济的各个部分越是符合于或者接近于客观上所要求的比例，则整个国民经济的发展就越能够以高速度前进。我们的社会主义建设总路线和两条腿走路的方针，是以社会生产发展的客观规律为依据的，是对于马克思主义再生产理论的创造性的运用，它是从战略部署上把社会主义的高速度发展和按比例发展巧妙结合起来的典范。从1958年以来，我国国民经济大跃进之成为现实，恰好证明总路线和一套两条腿走路的方针完全正确。
    观察国民经济的比例关系是适应还是失调，应该从全局性的、根本性的比例关系上来考察。只要重工业以最快的速度优先发展，农业和轻工业也都有了高速度的发展，人民生活水平首先是工农生活水平又都得到了提高，那就不会在国民经济中发生长期性的、全局性的比例失调，工农联盟的政治关系也必然日趋巩固。至于在实际工作中，具体指标有的偏高或偏低，以致国民经济个别环节间的不相适应，事实上是难于避免的，但它在性质上却完全不同于全局性的、根本性的比例失调。
    对于不平衡和不协调现象的出现是要做具体分析的。根据辩证法的观点，平衡是相对的、暂时的，不平衡是绝对的、经常的。因此，即使在主观上如何努力求得平衡，总还会有不平衡出现，更不要说主观反映客观，只能是大体上符合客观实际，而不可能百分之百地符合客观实际了。在国民经济发展中，也常常有个别薄弱环节的存在。这种不平衡大都是由于自然条件或历史条件所造成，并不是短期间所能解决的。至于为了完成某一重大经济任务，而在某些次要的方面有意识地放松一些，以致出现某些个别的、暂时的不协调现象，那正是辩证地对待大局和小局的问题，也不是什么工作上的错误和缺点。
    必须正确地认识，国民经济综合平衡工作，是在高速度发展中来确定国民经济各个部分之间的比例关系的。它既不是只要比例，不管速度；又不是只要速度，不顾比例。党中央从来是重视国民经济平衡工作的。这种实事求是的、经过综合分析的平衡，是跟以右倾保守思想为实质的消极平衡和机械平衡有本质上的差别的。我们对于正确的综合平衡从来坚持不懈，并且要使它日益走向科学化。而右倾机会主义分子不过是以综合平衡为幌子来散播右倾机会主义的毒菌。因此必须和他们进行严肃的斗争，不准他们招摇撞骗，鱼目混珠。
    国民经济综合平衡的任务，就是通过国民经济平衡表的指标体系，来全面地反映扩大再生产过程中各种基本因素的相互联系，相互制约的必然性。就计划工作来说，就是在扩大再生产过程中，根据社会需要，经过计算、对比、研究，按比例地在国民经济各部门间分配资源——人力、物力、财力，使需要与资源相适应，使人力、物力、财力三者之间都保持相互适应的比例。不言而喻，上述这种按比例的分配，是以党和国家的政策方针为依据的，同时还必须考虑到重点和一般，目前和将来，并且要在各地区之间进行生产力的合理配置。
    农业是国民经济发展的基础，必须把优先发展重工业同迅速发展农业结合起来，并加强工业对农业的支援下面谈谈综合平衡的必要性。
    一、关于重工业同农业和轻工业的发展关系问题。党中央提出：在优先发展重工业的条件下，发展工业和发展农业同时并举，发展重工业和发展轻工业同时并举。这个方针，把这三者间的关系作了明确而科学的部署，同时也深刻地反映了马克思主义再生产理论中关于两大部类比例关系的原理。
    马克思主义的再生产理论表明：在第一部类优先发展的同时，第二部类也必须按比例的发展。从社会生产的实物内容上看，两大部类的比例关系同重工业和轻工业、农业的比例关系是一致的。工业和农业是两大主要的物质生产部门。一切社会物质财富都是从这两个部门创造出来的。所以，在重工业、轻工业、农业之间保持适当的比例，也就从根本上解决了生产资料生产和消费资料生产这两大部类的比例关系。党中央对于我国重工业同农业和轻工业的发展关系所作的战略部署，是根据我国的实际情况，从全面的观点出发，从发展和联系的观点出发，掌握了国民经济的主要矛盾，从而把它们分别放在应有的位置上，既使它们各得其所，又使它们互相适应。这样不但可以充分调动六亿五千万人的积极性，大大加快我国社会主义建设的速度，而且可以保证整个国民经济不致发生全局性的、长期性的比例失调。
    国民经济综合平衡工作，就是根据党中央的战略部署和每一计划期间的政治经济任务，首先对重工业、农业和轻工业的建设规模和生产指标进行实际安排的。为了社会主义经济的高速度发展和劳动生产率的不断提高，为了用现代的科学技术来装备国民经济各部门，重工业必须优先发展这一方针是肯定不移的。但是我们并不是为发展重工业而发展重工业的。重工业发展的终极目的，不过是为了提高人民的生活水平。因此，重工业的发展必须为整个国民经济服务，而首先是为农业服务。只有这样，才能更好地贯彻在优先发展重工业的条件下，发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针。马克思说：“超越于劳动者个人需要的农业劳动生产率，是一切社会生产的基础。”又说：“社会用来生产小麦和牲畜等等所需要的时间越少，用来进行其他的生产——物质和精神的生产的时间就越多。”可见农业生产在国民经济中处于多么重要的地位。尤其在我国的具体情况下，农业是国民经济发展的基础，它对于国民经济各部门的发展都起着促进作用。只有在优先发展重工业的同时，迅速发展农业，才能使社会主义工业化的大踏步前进没有后顾之忧。因而重工业的发展，必须首先着重于对农业的支援，才能够更好地贯彻工农业并举的战略方针。而且只有加强工业对农业的支援，更快地实现农业的机械化、水利化、化学化和电气化，更快地提高农业的劳动生产率，国家才能够从农业部门得到更多的粮食和各种食品，更多的轻工业原料，更多的积累基金，并且能够从农业部门解脱出更多的劳动力输送给工业部门。而所有这些，都是有赖于通过综合平衡进行安排的。
    二、关于生产建设和人民生活的问题。这个问题的经济实质是国民收入在积累和消费方面如何分配和使用的问题。积累和消费是以生产资料和消费资料为实物内容的。因而两大部类的比例关系是积累和消费这一比例关系的前提。党对于生产建设和人民生活的方针是统筹兼顾，适当安排，也就是在不断增加生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上不断改善人民生活。这个方针怎样在计划经济的实践中具体化呢？在计划期间，国民收入总额是有一定限度的。如果在积累方面使用得多些，就要在消费方面使用得少些；反之亦然。经验证明，只要国民收入有了高速度的增长，人民生活有了必要的提高，积累率虽然高一些，也不会造成积累和消费的比例关系失调。而要正确地确定积累和消费的比例，既保证生产建设有高速度的发展，又不致影响人民生活水平有必要的提高，就必须借助于综合平衡得出比较准确的结论。
    三、关于大中小型企业并举和洋土并举的问题。在生产建设过程中，现代化大工业，特别是某些重工业，要在较长期间不断地提取生产资料和劳动力，而在它们投入生产之前，却不提供任何有效的产品。另一些企业，如采用简易生产方法的中小型企业，或者某些轻工业，它们不仅在一年间多次提取生产资料和劳动力，同样也不断地提供新的生产资料和生活资料。前一类企业，一般都属于社会主义建设的经济命脉，不大搞这类建设是不行的。但是这类企业建设较慢，投资较多，发挥投资效益时间也较长，因此，党中央确定了在以现代化大企业为纲的条件下，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，洋法生产和土法生产同时并举的方针。这样可以广泛地、全面地发挥群众的积极性，充分利用一切可能利用的条件，迅速提高生产水平，大大加快社会主义建设的速度。但大中小型企业、洋法生产和土法生产各占什么样的比例，才既有利于今天，又有利于明天呢？这也有赖于综合平衡。
    四、关于地区经济的综合发展问题。我国是一个幅员辽阔的、多民族的大国，而旧中国给我们留下的遗产又是现代工业偏集于沿海地带。为了促进地区经济的综合发展，党中央确定了在集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的条件下，中央工业和地方工业同时并举，适当安排沿海工业和内地工业的关系，以及努力发展少数民族地区经济的方针。
    地区的经济活动，是由地区内部的关系、中央与地方的关系、地区与地区的关系等等多方面交织在一起的。一个地区所创造的财富，并不是全部在本地区使用；而在本地使用的财富，又不全是在本地区创造的。在本地同外地之间，不仅存在着按等价交换原则所进行的物资和货币的转移；同时还存在着中央与地方之间，由于财政信贷资金的上缴下拨所引起的资金和物资产品的净转移；而且在财政、信贷同物资产品的净转移（差出或差入）之间，又存在着一系列复杂的联系。所有这些，都有赖于通过综合平衡进行观察和安排。
    综上所述，可见综合平衡工作是关系到整个经济生活和正确处理人民内部矛盾的重大问题，而不是一个简单的技术性问题。
    社会主义经济高速度按比例的发展是一种客观要求，为了正确地反映这种客观要求，计划工作就要以综合平衡作为一种基本方法。让我们高举社会主义建设总路线的红旗，为加速我国国民经济的大跃进，为提高经济科学的水平，为提高国民经济计划管理的水平而奋斗吧！
