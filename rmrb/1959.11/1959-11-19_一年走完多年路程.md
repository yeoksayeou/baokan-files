In the recent Scientific and Technological Research Work Conference on the Three Gorges Giant Water Conservancy Hub Project, the teachers of the Engineering Mechanics Department of Harbin Institute of Technology presented a technical document on "Stress Analysis of Gravity Dams," providing an important basis for the design of hydropower station dams. Those unfamiliar with the situation would certainly assume that a department capable of producing such significant scientific research results must have at least five or six years of history. Who would have known that it was actually created by Harbin Institute of Technology in the Great Leap Forward of 1958?

The new Engineering Mechanics Department of Harbin Institute of Technology was established by combining the school's original Theoretical Mechanics and Materials Mechanics teaching and research sections, along with a newly established Engineering Mechanics specialty teaching and research section. This newly established specialty teaching and research section now has fourteen teachers. Some were teaching backbones drawn from the two basic course teaching and research sections, and some were selected and trained from senior students. Currently, this new teaching force is diligently studying under the guidance of experienced teachers to build a solid theoretical foundation. At the same time, in accordance with the spirit of "training soldiers in battle," they are working with experienced teachers to jointly participate in the research of six or seven major scientific and technological projects related to hydropower stations, such as "Stress Analysis of Gravity Dams," "Vibration Problems of Water Turbines," and "Strength of Water Turbine Runners."

    一年走完多年路程
    在不久前举行的三峡巨型水利枢纽工程科学技术研究工作会议上，哈尔滨工业大学工程力学专业的教师们提出了一份“重力坝应力分析”的技术文件，给水电站大坝的设计提供了重要的依据。不熟悉情况的人一定会以为，能提出这样重大科学研究成果的专业，至少该有五、六年的历史。谁知它却是哈尔滨工业大学在1958年大跃进中办起来的一个新专业所做的。
    哈尔滨工业大学工程力学新专业，是由学校原有的理论力学、材料力学两个基础课教研室，加上新成立的工程力学专业课教研室建立而成的。这个新建的专业课教研室，现在已经有十四名教师。其中有的是从两个基础课教研室抽调出来的教学骨干，有一部分是从高年级学生中挑选出来培养的。现在，这批新的教学力量，正一面在老教师的指导下，刻苦进修，以打好理论基础；同时又根据“在战斗中练兵”的精神，和老教师们一起，共同参加有关水电站的“重力坝应力分析”、“水轮机振动问题”、“水轮机工作轮强度”等六、七项重大科学技术课题的研究工作。
