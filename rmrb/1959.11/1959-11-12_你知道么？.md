    Do you know?
    When you buy undershirts or cotton sweaters, they are often marked with the yarn count. Generally speaking, one count of yarn means that one pound of cotton is spun into a yarn 840 yards long. The higher the count, the finer the yarn.
    Now, cotton yarn is divided into three types: coarse-count yarn, medium-count yarn, and fine-count yarn. Six to ten counts is coarse-count yarn, which is used to weave large cloth and blue cloth; eighteen to twenty-three counts is medium-count yarn, which is generally used to weave city cloth, worker-peasant blue cloth, and dyed cloth; twenty-eight to one hundred counts is fine yarn, also called high-count yarn, which is used to weave fine poplin. After yarns of 42 counts or more are twisted into threads, they are woven into high-end products such as gabardine and khaki. Because the thickness of the yarn varies, the amount of yarn used for various fabrics is also different. Generally, city cloth (21-count yarn for weft, 23-count yarn for warp) uses 13.3 kilograms of yarn per 100 meters; 18-count plain cloth uses 16.36 kilograms of yarn per 100 meters; khaki (42-count twisted yarn for weft, 21-count yarn for warp) uses 13.1 kilograms of yarn per 100 meters; gabardine (42-count twisted yarn for weft, 21-count yarn for warp) uses 18 kilograms of yarn per 100 meters.
    Generally speaking, it takes more time to produce fine yarn than coarse yarn. Every thousand spindles produce 35 kilograms of 21-count yarn per hour; while only 13.3 kilograms of 42-count fine yarn can be spun.

    你知道么？
    当你买背心或棉毛衣的时候，常常标着是多少支纱的。通常说的一支纱，是用一磅棉花纺出一条八百四十码长的纱叫一支纱，纺出的支数越多，纱就越细。
    现在，棉纱分粗支纱、中支纱、细支纱三种。六支到十支为粗支纱，大包布和毛蓝布就是用这种纱织的；十八到二十三支纱叫中支纱，一般用来织市布，工农蓝布和染色布；二十八到一百支纱叫细纱，也叫高支纱，用这种纱织细府绸。把四十二支以上的纱合股纺成线以后，织成华达呢、卡其等等高级品。因为纱的粗细不等，各种布的用纱量也不同。一般市布（纬线二十一支纱、经线二十三支纱）每百米用纱十三点三公斤；十八支纱的平布，每百米用纱十六点三六公斤；卡其（纬纱四十二支股线、二十一支经纱）每百米用纱十三点一公斤；华达呢（纬线四十二支股线、二十一支经纱）每百米用纱十八公斤。
    一般说来，生产细纱比粗纱费时间，每一千锭每小时生产二十一支纱三十五公斤；而纺四十二支细纱只能纺十三点三公斤。
