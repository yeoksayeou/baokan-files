High Morale Overwhelms the Waves, Fresh Fish Celebrate a Bountiful Harvest
    ——A Record of Shanghai Fishing Vessels No. 267 and 268, a Pair of High-Yield Fishing Boats

Fishing vessels 267 and 268 are sister ships. The fishermen on these two boats, in order to overfulfill this year's national fish production plan, so that the people can eat more fresh fish and provide more raw materials for the food industry, are fighting side by side day and night on the vast ocean. From January to September this year, they caught a total of more than 1,500 tons of fish, an increase of 33.76% over the total output of last year, and they crossed the threshold into 1960 at 9:00 am on August 28th, creating the highest record in the country for the average output of fishing vessels with the same horsepower and of all types of fishing vessels.

    Grasping Fishing Patterns
    Calling Fish into the Net

The natural environment of the sea is constantly changing. Fishermen have an old saying: "The boat is moving, the water is flowing, and the fish are swimming." But the crew of fishing vessels 267 and 268 say: "We people are flexible!" As long as people give full play to their subjective initiative, they can better grasp and apply objective laws and create greater achievements.

During the intense work in August and September, the Party's call, like a spring thunder, aroused even greater enthusiasm among the crew of 267 and 268. In mid-August, the machinery of fishing vessels 267 and 268 suddenly broke down, and it was planned to take six days to repair. Time is fish! This speed was too slow! All the crew members of the two fishing vessels immediately plunged into this battle to repair the machinery and seize time.

The fishing vessels were repaired four days ahead of schedule! However, they were still two days late in going to sea, and the fishing vessels that had left two days earlier had already caught more than 36,000 jin of fish.

"We must catch up quickly and consolidate our gains," everyone rushed to the fishing grounds with full confidence. The captains studied the distribution and production of fishing vessels in each fishing ground almost every hour, making comprehensive and detailed analyses and research. They considered that a large haul of 8,000 jin had appeared in the southern fishing grounds a few days ago, so other fishing vessels went south. The northern fishing grounds where fishing vessels 267 and 268 were located averaged 2,400 jin to 3,200 jin per haul, so where was better? Should they go to the southern fishing grounds or stay where they were? Finally, they comprehensively considered the fishing grounds, fish fry, tides, and all subjective and objective conditions. Everything showed that the northern fishing grounds were more advantageous. They made a final decision: "Seize the opportunity, grasp the center of the fishing grounds, and adhere to balanced production on the spot." This pair of fishing vessels persisted in place. Although they were late to go to sea and only worked for nine days, they caught more than 126,000 jin, becoming the highest-yielding unit in this navigation team in mid-August. The red flag flew for the eighth time on the mast of fishing vessels 267 and 268.

    Unity and Fraternity, Selfless Help

The sister ships 267 and 268 can overcome various incredible difficulties in the sea because they are a strong collective that cannot be dispersed by huge waves or blown away by strong winds. Under the guidance of the idea of "everything for catching more fish," all the crew members of these two fishing vessels are united like one person, and a new type of relationship between people, shining with the brilliance of communist thought, has been established between them.

On fishing vessels 267 and 268, from the captain to the cook, they take care of each other and turn the fishing boat into a close-knit family. One day in July, the net was being raised, and the crew members were joyfully pouring the fish in the net onto the deck. A large tiger fish weighing more than 100 jin was still jumping around. Suddenly, with a "thud," the tail of the big tiger fish hit Sheng Xinyou's thigh. The long, hard fin on the fish's tail pierced into the skin two inches deep. The fin was covered with barbs like awns, which drilled deeper and deeper into the flesh the more they were pulled, and there was also venom. Sheng Xinyou gritted his teeth and pulled the thorns out hard, and a burst of pain made him faint. Dai Fangqing, a crew member who was hoisting the net, rushed over immediately, bent down, and put his mouth to Sheng Xinyou's wound to suck out the venom. Dai Fangqing didn't even think about the possibility of getting poisoned himself. Other crew members quickly brought kerosene and poured it on Sheng Xinyou's wound to prevent it from rotting. Later, Sheng Xinyou woke up and still insisted on working. No one could persuade him to go down to the wheelhouse to rest. He said, "If I go down, there will be one less person on the deck, and the work of the comrades will be heavier."

Such selfless labor and friendly mutual assistance are common on their ships at sea. For example, crew members on the deck go to the engine room to help repair machines, and engine room personnel go to the deck to help pick fish and pack boxes, which are common occurrences. The cook, Li Zuoren, usually cares about everyone's life. When crew members are sick, he cares for them warmly, serves tea and pours water, and tries his best to make delicious meals for the sick. They said: "As long as we are all of one mind on the ship, the sea water will also turn into gold."

Fishing vessels 267 and 268 not only unite their own crew members like one person, but also cooperate and unite with each other. During operations, they take turns casting nets, but sometimes the amount of fish caught by the two ships is different. At this time, the ship that catches less will take the initiative to cast more nets so that the ship that catches more fish has more time to pick fish, pack boxes, and put them in the ice hold. One day in early spring, the fishing net of the 268 fishing vessel was badly damaged because it touched underwater obstacles, but there was no spare net for repair. At this time, the 267 fishing vessel did not hesitate to give its last spare net to the 268 fishing vessel.

Fishing vessels 267 and 268 also carried forward the communist spirit of putting others before oneself and selfless dedication. One afternoon in April, a gale of magnitude 10 or more blew at sea, and fishing vessels 267 and 268 were returning to port. In such a strong wind, any impact from a huge wave is a serious danger. However, at that time, the crew members of the 267 and 268 fishing vessels were not thinking about their own safety, but were considering that there were still some wooden sailboats at sea, and they should help them at this time.

When the fishing vessels were sailing north of Chashan, they suddenly saw a flickering white spot. They knew that this was the signal for help from a wooden sailboat. The old captain gave the order to rescue without hesitation. The fishing vessels approached the distressed ship at high speed on the stormy sea. A wooden sailboat with a broken mast became clearer and clearer. All sixteen people on the wooden sailboat were soaking wet, the rudder had been shattered by the wind and waves, and the ship had lost its ability to resist the wind and waves. The fishing vessels took these people one by one onto their own ships, and the crew members immediately gave the warm beds to the fishermen in distress, and cooked for them to eat. The fishermen were full of gratitude and could not speak for a long time.

  Life is Full of the Joy of Battle

Fishing at sea is intense work and life is also hard, which is different from people's lives on land. At sea, eating and sleeping cannot be done on time, in regular portions, or according to routine.

Although life is hard, they are always fighting and living happily. Why do these people have so much energy and courage? They often say: In order to bring happiness to the people, in order to allow the people to eat more fish, they are not afraid of any difficulties.

The battle is intense and life is hard, but their study is well organized. Twenty-six of the twenty-seven official crew members on these two ships subscribed to "Branch Life," and each ship subscribed to "Liberation Daily," "Youth Daily," "Red Flag," and "Liberation" magazine. One hundred percent of the people on the ship participated in cultural and technical studies. They taught and learned from each other. Those with higher cultural levels taught those with lower cultural levels, and experienced old crew members were teachers for new crew members.

Whenever there is a little free time, everyone gathers on the deck, and lively and vigorous recreational activities unfold. Some play the huqin, some play the flute, and some sing. Life is really tense, happy, rich, and fulfilling.

The great festival of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China has arrived. People are immersed in the joy of the festival, and the dining table is filled with delicious fish dishes. When people are celebrating the festival, all the crew members of the 267 and 268 fishing vessels are still fighting on the boundless ocean. The crew members of fishing vessels 267 and 268, because of their infinite loyalty to the country and the people, are brave, tenacious, and unafraid of difficulties. With abundant revolutionary energy, they ride the wind and waves and raise a red flag on the blue sea.

    干劲压海浪　鱼鲜庆丰收
    ——记上海二六七、二六八号一对丰产渔轮
    渔轮267号和268号是一对姊妹渔轮。这两艘船的渔捞工人，为了超额完成今年的国家鱼产计划，让人民能吃到更多的鲜鱼，给食品工业提供更多的原料，他们肩并肩地日夜战斗在辽阔的海洋上。从今年1月到9月，他们共捕鱼一千五百多吨，产量比去年全年增长33.76％，并且在8月28日上午九点钟就跨进了1960年的大门，创造了全国同马力渔轮和各种渔轮平均产量的最高记录。
    摸捕鱼规律
    叫鱼儿进网
    大海的自然环境随时都在变化。捕鱼工人有句老话：“船是动的，水是流的，鱼是游的”。但是渔轮267、268号船员们却说：“我们人是活的呀！”只要人发挥了主观能动性，就能更好地掌握与运用客观规律，创造出更大的成绩。
    在大干8、9两个月的时候，党的号召像一声春雷一样，激起了267、268号船员更大的干劲。8月中旬，渔轮267、268号机器突然发生故障，计划要六天才能修好。时间就是鱼啊！这样的速度太慢了！两渔轮的全体船员立即投入这一场检修机器争夺时间的战斗里。
    渔轮提前四天修好了！但是，他们出海还是晚了两天，早出两天的渔轮已经比他们多捕了三万六千多斤。
    “我们要急起直追，稳扎稳打”，大家信心百倍地赶到渔场。船长几乎每小时都在研究着渔轮在各渔场的分布和生产的情况，作着全面详细的分析和研究。他们考虑到前几天在南方渔场上出现过一网捕获八千斤的大网头，因此其他渔轮南下了。267、268号渔轮所在的北方渔场平均一网捕获二千四百斤到三千二百斤，那么究竟在哪里好呢？是去南方渔场还是原地不动？最后他们综合了渔场、鱼苗、潮水和一切主客观情况，一切说明还是北方渔场更为有利，他们做出最后决定：“抓紧时机，掌握渔场中心，原地坚持均衡生产。”这一对渔轮在原地坚持下来，虽然他们迟出海，共只作业九天，结果捕获了十二万六千多斤，成为8月中旬这一航海队的产量最高的单位。红旗第八次在267、268号渔轮桅顶上飘扬。
    团结友爱　舍己为人
    267、268号姊妹轮，能在大海中战胜各种难以置信的困难，是因为他们是一个巨浪打不散、狂风吹不乱的坚强集体。这两艘渔轮的全体船员在“一切为了多捕鱼”的思想指导下，团结得像一个人一样，他们之间已经建立起一种新型的、闪耀着共产主义思想光辉的人与人之间的关系。
    渔轮267、268号上至船长下到炊事员，他们之间互相体贴关怀，把渔船变成一个亲密无间的大家庭。这是在7月份的一天中午，起网了，船员们怀着喜悦的心情，把网里的鱼倒在甲板上，一条一百多斤重的大虎鱼，还在乱蹦乱跳。忽然“卜”的一下，这大虎鱼的尾巴打在盛信友的大腿上，鱼尾上长长的硬鳍刺进皮肤两寸深，鳍上布满了像麦芒一样的倒刺，越拔越往肉里钻，而且还有毒液。盛信友咬紧牙关狠命地把刺拔出来，一阵剧痛使他昏了过去。正在吊网的船员戴方清立刻猛冲过去，俯侧身体，用嘴对准盛信友的伤口，把毒液吸了出来，戴方清对自己可能沾上毒液而中毒这一点，想也没想，其他船员也赶快拿来了火油，浇在盛信友的伤口上，以防止腐烂。后来盛信友醒来了，他仍旧坚持工作，谁也不能把他劝下轮去休息，他说：“我下去了，甲板上少了一个人，同志们的工作就加重了。”
    这种忘我劳动、友爱互助的事迹，在他们海上比比皆是。如甲板上的船员到机舱帮助修理机器，轮机人员上甲板帮助拣鱼、装箱，都是常有的事。炊事员李作仁，平时就关心大家的生活，在船员生病的时候，更是问寒问暖，递茶倒水，千方百计地做出可口的饭菜给病员吃。他们说：“只要我们全船一条心，海水也会变黄金。”
    渔轮267、268号不仅各自把自己的船员团结得像一个人一样，而且两只船之间共同协作，团结友爱。作业时，他们轮流放网，但有时两条船捕起的鱼多少不一样，这时捕得少的船就主动多下网，让捕鱼多的船有较长的时间拣鱼装箱，下冰舱。初春的一天，268渔轮的鱼网因为触到海底障碍物，破损很大，可是又没有修补的备网。这时267号渔轮毫不犹豫地把自己剩下的最后一片备网给了268号。
    渔轮267、268号还发扬了先人后己、舍己为人的共产主义精神。4月的一天下午，海上刮起了十级以上的大风，267、268号轮正在返航。在这样大风里，任何一个冲击的巨浪都是一种严重的危险。但是，当时267、268两轮的船员们想的不是自己的安危，而是考虑到海上还有一些木帆船，在这样的时刻，应当帮助他们。
    当渔轮航行在茶山北面的时候，他们突然看到一个闪闪忽忽的白点，他们知道这是木帆船求救的信号。老船长毫不犹豫地下了抢救的命令。渔轮在惊涛骇浪的海面上飞速地和遇难船接近。一只断了桅的木帆船看得越来越清楚了。木帆船上的十六个人，个个都是衣服湿淋淋的，船舵被风浪击碎了，船已经失去了抵抗风浪的能力。渔轮把这些人一个个都接上自己的船，船员们立即把温暖的床，让给遇难的渔民，又烧饭给他们吃。渔民们满怀感激，半天讲不出话来。
  生活充满战斗的欢乐气息
    出海捕鱼，工作是紧张的，生活也是艰苦的，这与人们在陆地上的生活不一样；在海上，吃饭、睡眠都不能按时、按顿、按常规进行。
    虽然生活艰苦，可是他们总是高高兴兴地战斗着，生活着。为什么这些人会有那么充沛的干劲和勇气呢？他们常说：为了给人民带来幸福，为了让人民能够吃到更多的鱼，什么困难都不怕。
    战斗很紧张，生活很艰苦，可是他们的学习组织得很正常。这两条船上的二十七个正式船员，有二十六人订了“支部生活”，每条船都订有“解放日报”、“青年报”、“红旗”和“解放”杂志。船上百分之百的人参加了文化、技术学习，他们互教互学，文化高的教文化低的，在技术上有经验的老船员是新船员的教师。
    稍为空闲的时候，大家聚在甲板上，生动活泼的文娱生活展开了，有的拉胡琴、有的吹笛，有的唱歌，生活真是过得又紧张，又愉快，又丰富，又充实。
    建国十周年的伟大节日到来了，人们沉浸在节日的欢乐里，餐桌上盛放着丰美的鱼肴，当人们在欢庆节日的时候，267、268号两渔轮的全体船员仍旧战斗在一望无际的汪洋大海上。267、268号渔轮的船员们，由于对国家对人民无限忠诚，他们英勇顽强，不怕困难，以充沛的革命干劲，乘风破浪，树起了碧海上的一面红旗。
