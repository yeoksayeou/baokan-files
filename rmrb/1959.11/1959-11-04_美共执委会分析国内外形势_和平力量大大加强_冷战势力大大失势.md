Xinhua News Agency, November 1st, New York dispatch: Today's New York "Worker's Weekly" published a letter from the National Executive Committee of the Communist Party USA to all party members, concerning the discussion within the party of the draft political resolution to be submitted to the party's Seventeenth National Congress.

The letter pointed out that many major events have occurred since the draft political resolution of the party was drafted. The most remarkable of these developments is Khrushchev's visit to the United States and its impact. This visit, and Eisenhower's scheduled visit to the Soviet Union, are themselves the result of the growing trend in the world towards peaceful coexistence, and the result of certain trends brewing domestically demanding a change in the direction of foreign policy.

This development was caused by a number of pressures, which are an important first step in getting rid of Dulles' rigid "brinkmanship" policy. These pressures include: the increasing bankruptcy of Dulles' policy, the increasing strength of domestic and international people's forces striving for peace, the increasing contradictions and divisions among big capitalists, and the great achievements of socialist countries.

Ultimately, it is because the balance of power in the world has changed, and the dominance of American capitalism has been increasingly challenged in several aspects, presenting monopoly capital groups with many increasingly serious problems.

The Cold War is far from over. Government figures and Cold War advocates from both parties, represented by Rockefeller of the Republican Party and Acheson of the Democratic Party, have launched a counter-offensive aimed at undoing all the achievements that have been made.

However, most importantly, the forces of the Cold War have greatly lost ground, and the position of the forces fighting for peace has now been greatly strengthened.

The letter talked about the domestic situation, saying that the reactionaries are stepping up their offensive at home. Of particular note is the passage of the notorious Landrum-Griffin Act, which is even more severe than the Taft-Hartley Act, and this law puts more brutal chains on workers in unions.

It is also our responsibility to redouble our efforts to fight for the realization of socialism in accordance with the current new situation. Because the American people are changing their views on socialism. Our party has taken on the responsibility of striving for the realization of socialism.

### 美共执委会分析国内外形势  和平力量大大加强　冷战势力大大失势

    美共执委会分析国内外形势
    和平力量大大加强　冷战势力大大失势
    据新华社1日讯　纽约消息：今天的纽约“工人周报”刊载了美国共产党全国执行委员会为将要提交党的第十七次全国代表大会的政治决议草案而在全党进行的讨论致全体党员的信。
    信中指出，自从党的政治决议草案拟定以来，已经发生了许多重大的事件。在这些事态发展中最引人注目的，是赫鲁晓夫访问美国之行及其影响。这次访问和艾森豪威尔预定访问苏联之行，本身就是世界走向和平共处的日益增强的趋势的结果，是国内正在酝酿中的要求改变外交政策方针的某些趋势的结果。
    这种事态发展是由一些压力造成的，它们是摆脱杜勒斯的僵硬的“战争边缘”政策的重要的第一步。这些压力包括：杜勒斯的方针日益破产，国内外人民争取和平的力量日益强大，大资本家之间的矛盾和分歧日益尖锐，社会主义国家取得了伟大的成就。
    归根结底，是因为全世界的力量对比改变了，美国资本主义的统治地位遭到若干方面日益增强的挑战，使垄断资本集团面临着许多日益严重的问题。
    冷战远没有结束。政府人物中以及以共和党的洛克菲勒和民主党的艾奇逊为代表的两党的冷战鼓吹者，已经发动了反攻，目的在于取消一切已经取得的成就。
    可是，最重要的是，冷战势力已经大大失势，为和平而斗争的力量的阵地现在已经大大加强。
    信中谈到国内局势说，反动派正在国内加紧发动攻势。尤其值得注意的是，比塔夫脱—哈特莱法更厉害的、臭名远扬的兰德勒姆—格里芬法案已获得通过，这个法律把更残暴的锁链加在参加工会的工人身上。
    根据当前的新形势而再接再厉为争取实现社会主义而斗争，也是我们的责任。因为美国人民正在改变他们对社会主义的看法。我们党已经把争取实现社会主义的责任担负起来。
