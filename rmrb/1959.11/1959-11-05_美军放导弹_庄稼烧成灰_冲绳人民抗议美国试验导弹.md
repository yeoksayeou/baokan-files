    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo: The Okinawa Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held a prefectural assembly in Naha City on the evening of the 2nd to oppose U.S. missile testing.

    Six hundred citizens from all walks of life who attended the meeting passed a resolution stating that while the world is moving towards peaceful negotiations, the U.S. testing of "Nike" missiles is unsatisfactory. Therefore, it was decided to demand that U.S. President Eisenhower, Defense Secretary McElroy, and U.S. High Commissioner to the Ryukyu Islands Booth immediately stop the test.

    According to officials from Yomitan Village, Okinawa Island, after the U.S. military conducted a "Nike" missile launch test locally on October 31, the gas discharged by the rocket burned 660 square meters of sugarcane fields near the base.

    This behavior of the U.S. military, which threatens peace in the Far East and destroys the lives of the people of Okinawa Island, has aroused strong opposition from local residents. The "National Movement Liaison Council for Resolving the Okinawa Issue" has decided to launch a large-scale protest movement.

    Secretary-General of the Okinawa People's Party, Kamejiro Senaga, said in an interview with "Akahata" reporter Katsumi Kikuta that the U.S.'s guarantee that missiles would not pose a danger to residents is a complete lie, and the people in the area adjacent to the launch site have risen up to participate in the protest movement.

    He also said that villagers have held gatherings to protest against the U.S. military's missile exercises. Their slogans are: "Move out the killing weapons!" "Stop the tests, return our land!"

    Senaga Kamejiro emphasized that the people of Okinawa have seen from the facts that the United States is challenging peace at a time when the world is changing in the direction of peaceful coexistence.

    He pointed out that the Social Masses Party and some other leaders on Okinawa Island who had not taken an active stance against U.S. missile testing in the past have now also lodged strong protests against the United States. The conditions for all the people of Okinawa to rise up and join the protest movement have matured.

    Kikuta said that the people of mainland Japan support the struggle of the people of Okinawa and are preparing to launch a protest movement. Therefore, the people of Okinawa Island will not be isolated in their struggle.

    美军放导弹　庄稼烧成灰
    冲绳人民抗议美国试验导弹
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：东京消息，冲绳禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会2日晚上在那霸市举行了反对美国进行导弹试验的县民大会。
    参加大会的各界市民六百人通过决议说，当全世界走向和平协商的道路的时候，美国试验核武器“奈克”式导弹，这是不能令人满意的。因此决定要求美国总统艾森豪威尔、国防部长麦克耳罗伊和美国驻琉球群岛的高级专员布斯立即停止这个试验。
    据冲绳岛读谷村的官员说，当美军在10月31日在当地举行发射“奈克”式导弹试验后，火箭排泄出来的气体烧光了基地附近的六百六十平方米的甘蔗田。
    美军的这种威胁远东和平、破坏冲绳岛人民生活的行为已经激起了当地居民强烈的反对。“解决冲绳问题国民运动联络会议”决定要展开大规模的抗议运动。
    冲绳人民党书记长濑长龟次郎在向“赤旗报”记者听涛克已发表谈话时说，美国所谓导弹不会对居民造成危险这种保证是彻头彻尾的谎话，发射场邻近地区的人民都奋起参加了抗议运动。
    他还说，乡村居民纷纷举行集会，对美军导弹演习提出抗议。他们的口号是：“搬走杀人武器！”“停止试验，还我们土地！”
    濑长龟次郎强调指出，冲绳人民从事实中看到，美国是在世界向和平共处方向变化的时候，向和平挑战。
    他指出，社会大众党以及冲绳岛上其他一些过去对美国导弹试验没有采取积极反对态度的领导人现在也都对美国提出了强烈的抗议。全体冲绳人民奋起投入抗议运动的条件已成熟了。
    听涛克己说，日本本土人民支持冲绳人民的斗争，正在准备发动一个抗议运动。因此，冲绳岛人民在斗争中是不会孤立的。
