Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch: According to incomplete statistics from 24 provinces, autonomous regions, and the two municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai, 1,230,000 young workers and 34,988 youth teams and groups have already completed their work quotas for this year ahead of schedule and have stepped into 1960. This means that among the more than 10 million young workers across the country, on average, one out of every ten is already doing work for 1960, 1961, or 1962. This is a great victory for the Party's General Line and a great victory for the mass movement on the industrial front.

The mass movement to enter 1960 at high speed was launched by young workers across the country under the encouragement of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Over the past two months, under the leadership and support of Party committees at all levels, the Communist Youth League organizations at all levels on the industrial front have seized the excellent opportunity of the "Heroes' Conferences" held locally and nationally, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of young people, and carrying out in-depth and meticulous mobilization and organizational work. The League organizations in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places, through activities such as mobilizing young people to carefully calculate the accounts of the Great Leap Forward and formulate cross-year plans, have turned the general slogan of entering 1960 at high speed into a concrete action slogan for every young person. At the same time, League organizations in various places have also launched activities such as "creating miracles to welcome the Heroes' Conference," mobilizing young people to carry out innovation, learn from the advanced, and help the backward, rapidly guiding the movement towards widespread and in-depth development.

The great call issued by the Party at the National Heroes' Conference and the advanced deeds of heroes from all walks of life have promoted the more vigorous development of the movement to enter 1960 at high speed. In just one month, the number of people completing this year's work quota ahead of schedule has increased tenfold. From Shanghai to Xinjiang, from the snow-covered Greater Khingan Mountains to the warm, spring-like Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, from the machinery and transportation industries to the iron and steel and textile industries, from a few highly skilled advanced workers to general workers and apprentices, almost all of the more than 10 million young workers across the country have been involved in this upsurge. A large number of young construction workers are engaged in rapid construction, enabling more key projects to be put into production ahead of schedule. Many young workers in non-direct production departments have also enthusiastically joined the movement, and their outstanding achievements have created extremely favorable conditions for the entire class, workshop, and factory to collectively enter 1960. Technical personnel in offices have strived to complete production preparations ahead of schedule, paving the way for production workers to leap across time at high speed; financial and trade workers have moved their offices to factories and mines; barbers have brought their hairdressing tools to the front lines of production; and young actors have performed on-site to cheer on production workers. In Shanghai, 20,000 young students have used their holidays to participate in production at construction sites. A lively situation has emerged among young people across the country, with everyone striving for high speed.

From individuals entering 1960 at high speed to collectives entering 1960 at high speed, this is a new feature of the movement's development before and after the Heroes' Conference. The communist spirit of the Heroes' Conference representatives, who selflessly and enthusiastically helped comrades, has deeply educated many young workers. Young people at the Shanghai Tool Factory shouted the slogan "Don't let a single partner fall behind in the high-speed march into 1960." Young workers who are ahead of time are using various methods to help their companions catch up, and as a result, two-thirds of the young workers with quotas have now completed their annual work quota ahead of schedule. The Beijing Changxindian Communications Factory, which first initiated inter-factory collective high-yield counterpart competitions, organized 75 "three-help teams" (advanced helping backward, fast hands helping slow hands, skilled hands helping novices), so that all young people who have difficulties in the movement to enter 1960 have someone specifically responsible for helping them. By the end of October, the number of young workers entering 1960 reached 94.3% of the total number of young workers in the factory. Many enterprises have also ensured that all young workers have completed their work quotas for this year ahead of schedule. The Communist Youth League organization of the Second Construction Company of the Lanzhou Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction has set up models among young workers and organized extensive mass competitions, enabling all 2,008 young workers to enter 1960 more than two months ahead of schedule, creating extremely favorable conditions for the entire company to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule, and driving more than 15,000 young workers in the entire engineering bureau to enter 1960.

With the in-depth development of the movement to enter 1960 at high speed, the style of daring to think and daring to act, innovating technology, and boldly creating has been further developed among the broad masses of young workers. The Beijing Zhang Baifa Steel Bar Worker Youth Assault Team closely combined scientific management with large-scale competitions on the eve of the Heroes' Conference, creating a set of advanced experience in high-speed construction, which increased the team's production efficiency by leaps and bounds, opening up a broad road for construction workers to leap into 1960. Learning and promoting advanced experience has also been given more attention by young workers, and various observation groups, "seed-sowing teams," and "treasure-seeking teams" have been established everywhere. Technical performance competitions that combine the promotion of advanced experience with the improvement of technical level and closely combine large-scale competitions with solving key production problems are even more popular throughout the country. After 80% of the young workers in Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant participated in technical performance competitions and mastered advanced experience, the average daily steel output in late October increased by 22% compared with the first ten days of the month. Boldly innovating technology and widely promoting advanced experience have opened up a broader world for the movement to enter 1960 at high speed, becoming the driving force for the sustained development of the movement.

Since the Party Central Committee issued a fighting call to workers across the country at the Heroes' Conference to strive to complete this year's national economic plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it, and to create favorable conditions for the continued leap forward of the national economy next year, the slogan of entering 1960 at high speed has been closely linked with the slogan of striving for a "good start" and "monthly red" next year. Young workers across Heilongjiang Province are widely carrying out a mass movement to care for machines and maintain equipment while striving to complete this year's production tasks ahead of schedule, so that all equipment is kept clean, healthy, and efficient, preparing for a great battle in 1960. Young technical personnel at the Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory put forward the slogan "Logistics must come first," further carrying out counterpart competitions and one-dragon competitions, breaking the old convention that design lags behind production, and completing the design and planning tasks for 1960 ahead of schedule.

Currently, young workers across the country are closely following the one million pioneers, launching a more vigorous impact to complete this year's work quota ahead of schedule and enter 1960 at high speed, and striving to realize the call of the Party Central Committee—a full house this year and a good start next year.

    在党的领导下高举总路线红旗奋勇前进
    百万青工浩浩荡荡跨进1960年
    新华社11日讯　据二十四个省、区和北京、上海两市的不完全统计，目前已有一百二十三万名青年工人和三万四千九百八十八个青年班、组（队）提前完成了今年的工作量，跨进了1960年。这就是在全国一千多万名青年职工中，平均每十个人就有一个已经在做1960年或1961年、1962年的活。这是党的总路线的伟大胜利，也是在工业战线上大搞群众运动的伟大胜利。
    高速度跨进1960年的群众运动，是全国青年工人在党的八届八中全会精神鼓舞下开展起来的。两个月来，在各级党委的领导和支持下，工业战线的各级共青团组织，紧紧抓住各地和全国举行“群英会”的大好时机，大鼓青年的干劲，进行了深入细致的动员和组织工作。上海、天津、北京等地的团组织，通过发动青年人人算跃进细账、订跨年规划的活动，把高速度跨进1960年的总口号变成了每个青年的具体行动口号。同时，各地团组织还通过“创奇迹迎接群英会”的活动，发动青年大搞革新、学先进、帮落后，把运动迅速引向广泛深入。
    全国群英会上党所发出的伟大号召和各路英雄的先进事迹，推动着高速度跨进1960年运动更猛烈地发展。在短短一个月内，提前完成今年工作量的人数骤增十倍。从上海到新疆，从白雪皑皑的大兴安岭到温暖如春的云贵高原，从机械、运输业到钢铁、纺织业，从少数技术高的先进工人到一般工人、徒工，全国一千多万青年职工几乎都卷进了这个热潮。大批青年建筑工人大搞快速施工，使更多的重点工程提早投入了生产。许多非直接生产部门的青年工人也热情地投入运动，他们的出色成就，为全班、全车间、全厂集体跨进1960年创造了极为有利的条件。科室技职人员纷纷力争提前做好生产准备工作，为生产工人高速度跨越时间铺平道路；财贸工作人员将办公室搬到厂矿；理发员将理发工具带到生产前线；青年演员到现场演出，为生产工人加油。上海市有两万名青年学生，利用假日到工地参加生产。在全国青年中，出现了一个人人力争高速度的生动局面。
    由个人高速度跨进1960年到集体高速度跨进1960年，这是群英会前后运动发展的新特点。群英会代表大公无私热诚帮助同志的共产主义精神，使许多青年工人受到了深刻教育。上海工具厂青年喊出了“在高速度跨进1960年的急行军中，不让一个伙伴掉队”的口号。跑在时间前面的青年工人用各种方法帮助同伴赶上自己，结果，现在已经有三分之二有定额的青年工人提前完成了全年工作量。首先发起厂际集体高产对口赛的北京长辛店通信工厂，组织了七十五个“三帮队”（先进帮落后、快手帮慢手、熟手帮生手），使所有在跨进1960年运动中有困难的青年都有专人负责帮助，到10月底，跨进1960年的青年工人达到全厂青年工人总数的94.3％。有不少企业还作到了全部青工都提前完成了今年工作量。建筑工程部兰州第三工程局第二建筑公司的共青团组织在青年工人中大树标兵，组织广泛的群众性竞赛，使两千零八名青年工人全部提前两个多月跨进1960年，为全公司提前完成今年计划创造了极为有利的条件，并带动全工程局的一万五千多名青年工人跨进了1960年。
    随着高速度跨进1960年运动的深入发展，广大青年工人敢想敢干，革新技术、大胆创造的风格得到了进一步发扬。北京张百发钢筋工青年突击队，在群英会前夕把科学管理和大搞竞赛密切结合起来，创造了一套高速度施工的先进经验，使全队生产效率猛增一倍，为建筑业职工飞跃跨进1960年开辟了一条广阔的道路。学习和推广先进经验也更加受到青年工人的重视，到处都建立了各种观摩团、“播种队”和“送宝取经队”。把推广先进经验和提高技术水平结合起来、大搞竞赛和解决生产关键密切结合起来的技术表演赛，更是风行各地。天津第一钢厂80％的青年工人参加技术表演赛、掌握先进经验以后，10月下旬钢的平均日产量比上旬提高22％。大胆革新技术和广泛推广先进经验，给高速度跨进1960年运动开辟了更为广阔的天地，成为运动持续发展的动力。
    自党中央在群英会上向全国职工发出了争取提前和超额完成今年国民经济计划、为明年国民经济的继续跃进创造有利条件的战斗号召后，高速度跨进1960年的口号已经和力争明年“开门红“月月红”的口号紧密连接起来。黑龙江全省青年工人在力争提前完成今年生产任务的同时，正广泛开展一个爱护机器维修设备的群众运动，要使一切设备都保持清洁、健康、高效率，准备在1960年大战一场。洛阳矿山机器厂青年技职人员提出了“兵马未动、粮草先行”的口号，进一步开展了对手赛、一条龙竞赛，打破了设计落后于生产的旧常规，提前完成了1960年的设计和计划编制任务。
    现在，全国青年工人正紧随一百万先行者，向提前完成今年工作量、高速度跨进1960年发起更加猛烈的冲击，为实现党中央的号召——今年满堂红、明年开门红而奋斗。
