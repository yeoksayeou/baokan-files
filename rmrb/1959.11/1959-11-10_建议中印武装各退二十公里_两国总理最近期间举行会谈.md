Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Premier Zhou Enlai wrote to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on November 7 regarding the Sino-Indian border issue. The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's letter is as follows:

To His Excellency Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of the Republic of India, New Delhi

Dear Prime Minister,

Your Excellency's letter of September 26, 1959, has been received. Unfortunately, after that, on October 21, a new unexpected border conflict occurred south of Kongka Pass in Chinese territory. Regarding this conflict, the Chinese and Indian governments have exchanged several notes, including the Indian government's note to the Chinese government on November 4. It is deeply regrettable that this note from the Indian government not only disregards the basic facts regarding the border issue between the two countries and the truth of the border conflict incidents in many respects but also adopts an attitude that is extremely detrimental to the friendly relations between the two countries. Obviously, adopting this attitude will not help solve the problem. Under the current circumstances, I believe that the most important responsibility facing us is, first of all, to quickly and decisively take effective steps to seriously improve the uneasy situation on the border between the two countries and strive to fundamentally eliminate the possibility of any future border conflicts.

Since the border between China and India has never been demarcated and is very long, and is far from or relatively far from the political centers of the two countries, if the two governments do not come up with a very proper solution, I am worried that border conflicts that neither side wants to see may occur in the future. As long as such conflicts occur, even very small ones, they will be used by those who are hostile to the friendship between our two countries to achieve their ulterior motives. Our two countries have a long history of friendship, no fundamental conflicts of interest, and our two governments are the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We have no reason to allow the tense situation on the border between the two countries to continue.

Your Excellency's letter of September 26 contains many views that the Chinese government cannot agree with, and I am willing to explain my views on these on another occasion. However, I am pleased that this letter reiterates that the Indian government attaches great importance to maintaining friendly relations with China and agrees with the Chinese government's consistent proposition that border disputes that have already occurred should be resolved amicably and peacefully. Before a resolution is reached, the status quo should be maintained, and neither party should attempt to change the status quo in any way. In order to effectively maintain the status quo of the border between the two countries, ensure peace and tranquility on the border, and create a good atmosphere for the friendly resolution of the border issue, the Chinese government proposes that the armed forces of China and India immediately withdraw twenty kilometers each from the so-called McMahon Line in the east and the actual line of control between the two sides in the west; in the areas where the armed forces of both sides withdraw, both sides guarantee not to send armed personnel to garrison and patrol, but still retain civil administration personnel and unarmed police to perform administrative tasks and maintain order. This proposal actually expands the Indian government's proposal in its note of September 10 regarding both sides not sending armed personnel to Longju to the entire Sino-Indian border and increases the distance between the forces of both sides to as far as forty kilometers. If this distance needs to be further expanded, the Chinese government is also willing to consider it. In short, whether before or after our two countries' border is officially demarcated through negotiations, the Chinese government is willing to do everything possible to create the most peaceful and safest border area between our two countries, so that our two countries will never again have doubts or conflicts over border issues. If the Indian government agrees to this proposal of the Chinese government, the specific measures for implementing this proposal can be agreed upon by the two governments immediately through diplomatic channels.

The Chinese government has never had the intention of aggravating the border situation and the relations between the two countries. I believe that Your Excellency is also willing to see the current tension eased. I earnestly hope that, for the great and long-standing friendship of more than one billion people in our two countries, the Chinese and Indian governments can work together to quickly reach an agreement on the above proposal.

In order to further discuss the border issue and other issues in the relations between the two countries, the Chinese government proposes that the Prime Ministers of both countries hold talks in the near future.

Respected Prime Minister! The people of both countries hope that we will take action quickly. I think we should fulfill their wishes and not allow those who are looking for opportunities to meticulously try to undermine the great friendship between China and India to achieve their sinister purposes. I await Your Excellency's early reply.

With kind regards,
                                                             Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai
                                                                                                               November 7, 1959, in Beijing

### 建议中印武装各退二十公里  两国总理最近期间举行会谈

    周恩来总理就中印边界问题写信给尼赫鲁总理
    建议中印武装各退二十公里  两国总理最近期间举行会谈
    创造一条最和平最安全的边境地带，根本消除今后发生任何边境冲突的可能性
    新华社9日讯　周恩来总理11月7日就中印边界问题写信给印度总理尼赫鲁。周恩来总理的信全文如下：新德里印度共和国总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁先生阁下亲爱的总理先生：
    阁下1959年9月26日的来信已经收到了。非常不幸，在这以后，10月21日在中国境内的空喀山口以南地区，又发生了新的意外的边境冲突。关于这次冲突，中印两国政府已经交换过几次照会，包括印度政府在11月4日给中国政府的照会。令人十分遗憾的是，印度政府的这个照会不但在很多方面不顾关于两国边界问题的基本事实和边界冲突事件的真相，而且采取了一种极其有害于两国友好关系的态度。很明显，采取这种态度对于问题的解决是毫无帮助的。在目前的情况下，我认为，摆在我们面前的最重要的责任，首先是迅速地、毫不迟疑地采取有效的步骤，来认真改善两国边境的令人不安的状况，并且力求根本消除今后发生任何边境冲突的可能性。
    由于中印两国边界从来没有划定过，而又非常漫长，距离两国政治中心很远或者比较远，如果两国政府不想出一个十分妥善的解决办法，我担心双方都不愿意看到的边境冲突今后还有可能出现。而只要出现了这类冲突，那怕是很小的冲突，就会被那些敌视我们两国友谊的人们所利用，以达其不可告人的目的。我们两国之间有悠久的友好历史，没有根本利益的冲突，我们两国政府又是和平共处五项原则的倡议者，我们没有任何理由让两国边境的紧张形势继续存在下去。
    阁下9月26日的来信中包含着许多为中国政府所不能同意的观点，关于这些，我愿意在另外的机会说明我的意见。但是，我感觉高兴的是，这次来信再次声明，印度政府十分重视同中国维持友好关系，并且同意中国政府历来的主张，即对于已经发生的边界纠纷应该友好地、和平地加以解决，在达成解决以前，现状应予维持，任何一方都不得试图以任何方式改变现状。为了有效地维持两国边界的现状，确保边境的安谧，并且为边界问题的友好解决创造良好气氛，中国政府建议：中印两国的武装部队立即从东边的所谓麦克马洪线和西边的双方实际控制线各自后撤二十公里；在双方撤出武装部队的地区，双方保证不再派遣武装人员驻守和巡逻，但是仍然保留民政人员和非武装的警察，以执行行政任务和维持秩序。这个建议，实际上也就是把印度政府9月10日的照会中关于双方都不派遣武装人员到朗久的建议扩大到整个中印边境，并且使双方部队的距离扩大到四十公里之远。如果这一距离还需要更扩大，中国政府也愿意考虑。总之，无论在我们两国边界经过谈判正式划定以前或以后，中国政府都愿意竭尽一切努力，在我们两国之间创造一条最和平、最安全的边境地带，使我们两国永远不再为边境问题而发生疑惧或冲突。如果印度政府同意中国政府这一建议，实施这一建议的具体措施，可以由两国政府立即通过外交途径商定。
    中国政府从来没有使两国边境形势和两国关系紧张化的意愿。我相信，阁下也是愿意看到目前这种紧张情况缓和下来的。我殷切地希望，为了我们两国十亿多人民的伟大的悠久的友谊，中印两国政府能够共同努力，就上述建议迅速达成协议。
    为了进一步商谈边界问题和两国关系中的其他问题，中国政府建议，两国总理在最近期间举行会谈。
    尊敬的总理先生！两国的人民希望我们迅速地采取行动。我想，我们应当满足他们的愿望，而不使那些寻找机会无微不至地企图破坏中印两国伟大友谊的人们达到他们的阴险的目的。我等待着阁下的早日答复。
    顺致亲切的问候。
                      中华人民共和国国务院总理　周恩来
                                  一九五九年十一月七日于北京
