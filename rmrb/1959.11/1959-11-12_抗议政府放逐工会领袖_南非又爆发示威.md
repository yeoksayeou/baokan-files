Xinhua News Agency dispatches: In South Africa's brewing and fruit processing center, Paarl, approximately three thousand Africans held a demonstration march on the 9th, protesting the white government's unreasonable banishment of union leader Mrs. Mafeking. Mrs. Mafeking is the chairwoman of the African Food and Canning Workers' Union and the vice-chairwoman of the Women's Department of the African National Congress of South Africa.

On that afternoon, a large number of Africans, armed with spears and sticks, rushed to Mrs. Mafeking's residence to prevent the white government from escorting Mrs. Mafeking away. When they heard that Mrs. Mafeking had already left her hometown at noon, their anger reached its peak. They immediately launched a demonstration march, shouting, "Avenge Mrs. Mafeking!" The white government dispatched a large number of armed police, under the cover of an armored vehicle, to suppress the demonstrators. As a result, at least five Africans were injured.

    抗议政府放逐工会领袖
    南非又爆发示威
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在南非联邦酿酒业和水果加工业中心巴尔，约三千名非洲人9日举行示威游行，抗议白人政府无理放逐工会领袖马费肯夫人。马费肯夫人是非洲食品和罐头业工人工会主席、南非非洲人国民大会妇女部副主席。
    大批拿着长矛和棍棒的非洲人在当天下午赶到马费肯夫人住所，阻止白人政府把马费肯夫人押走。当他们听到马费肯夫人已经在中午就离开了家乡时，愤怒的情绪达到了顶点，他们立刻展开了示威游行，并且高呼“要为马费肯夫人报仇”。白人政府出动了大批武装警察，在一辆装甲车的掩护下，镇压游行群众。结果，至少有五名非洲人被打伤。
