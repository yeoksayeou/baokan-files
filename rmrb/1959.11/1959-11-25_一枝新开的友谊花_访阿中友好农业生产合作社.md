    A Newly Blossomed Flower of Friendship
    ——Visiting the Albania-China Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Fan Chengzhuo
    It was in late September, at the celebration held in Berat City for the 10th anniversary of the founding of our country, that a simple farmer stepped onto the rostrum to speak. He said, "Our newly established joint cooperative, in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, unanimously agreed to name our cooperative the Albania-China Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative."
    At the invitation of the Albania-China Friendship Cooperative, on the eve of the glorious 15th anniversary of the liberation of Albania, we went to visit. The fifteen-kilometer-long Berat boulevard, like a green dragon, led us in the direction of Rabada Village. To the left of the road, through the tall poplar trees, was a vast expanse of cotton fields shimmering like silver waves, stretching all the way to the foot of the distant mountains. Against the backdrop of the azure sky, the village and the lush green orchards lying on the hillside moved closer to us.
    This is the Albania-China Friendship Cooperative, newly formed from the merger of the Morava and Rabada agricultural cooperatives, and one of the largest agricultural cooperatives in the Berat district. We spent an unforgettable day in these two villages, feeling as if we were at home.
    The Albania-China Friendship Cooperative boasts four hundred hectares of cotton fields, promising a bountiful harvest, with cotton bolls hanging heavy and cotton peaches full of silver blossoms, large and plentiful. Cooperative Director Sadik told us that the Morava and Rabada cooperatives, the predecessors of the Albania-China Friendship Cooperative, achieved an average cotton yield of sixteen quintals per hectare last year. This year, it is expected to increase to seventeen quintals. To welcome the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the naming of the Albania-China Friendship Cooperative, all members unanimously increased this year's planned cotton delivery to the state from forty million leks (Albanian currency) to forty-five million leks, as a gift.
    More than a decade ago, there was not a single hectare of cotton field here, and no one knew how to plant cotton. The Party sent Cooperative Director Sadik to Tashkent in the Soviet Union to learn cotton planting techniques. In no time, this place has become a "white gold zone." After the textile factory built with China's assistance in Berat City is completed, the Albania-China Friendship Cooperative will expand the existing four hundred hectares of cotton fields to over one thousand hectares, specializing in cotton production to support the production of this cotton textile factory, a symbol of the crystallization of Albania-China friendship.
    The Albania-China Friendship Cooperative is truly abundant in all grains. In this cooperative's one thousand eight hundred hectares of cultivated land, one thousand two hundred hectares are planted with food crops, with 95% of the area cultivated by machinery. Last year, the yield per unit area of wheat and corn increased by four and a half times and two times respectively compared to the pre-war year of 1938. Over the years, the members have transformed the mountain slopes and valleys full of thorns and jungles into one hundred and ten hectares of orchards and vineyards, established a livestock department with one hundred and fifteen dairy cows, and also have a small workshop for repairing agricultural implements.
    The great development of cooperative production has greatly changed the face of the two villages and increased the income of the members. The cooperative has a total of three hundred and fifty households with one thousand one hundred laborers. At the beginning of the cooperative's establishment in 1950, the average daily wage was two kilograms of grain and twelve leks, while last year it reached three kilograms of grain and one hundred and thirty-one leks. This year, the cooperative's fund has reached forty million leks, almost equal to the total value of the more than six thousand quintals of cotton harvested last year.
    The light of the socialist cultural revolution has illuminated these two villages. Illiteracy among those under forty years old was eliminated as early as 1955, and children from every family are attending school. Moreover, last year, for the first time ever, two young men from the cooperative entered the University of Tirana. This cannot be considered a small matter for a rural area with extremely backward culture, which had been forgotten by the old society.
    Fifteen years ago, it was not like this.
    Morava and Rabada are both located on the fertile Berat Plain. The farmers here have always been diligent, but before liberation, they could not live a good life for generations. There is good sunshine and sufficient rainfall here, but the grain they grew did not belong to them. They could not maintain their food supply for more than four months each year. The land on the entire Berat Plain, including the villages of Morava and Rabada, belonged to one of the largest landlords in Albania before liberation—Frioni, whose family owned more than six thousand three hundred hectares of land.
    Now, the older farmers still clearly remember the scene of Frioni coming to Rabada Village each time. He was draped in a coat, holding a whip, with two bodyguards following him. When farmers saw him, they had to bend over and bow at fifty paces away, or kneel aside and wait for him to pass before they could get up. Every time he "visited," someone was bound to be unlucky. Chauš, an eighty-year-old farmer from the Albania-China Friendship Cooperative, was driven out of his home twelve times by the landlord for owing him debt, not even allowing him to live in the thatched hut that did not let in sunlight and had no stove.
    What a stark contrast between the past and present of the two villages of Morava and Rabada! November 29th this year is a double holiday for the Albania-China Friendship Cooperative. While celebrating the 15th anniversary of the liberation of their motherland, the members will celebrate the 7th anniversary of the establishment of Morava Cooperative. It was the Albanian Labor Party that liberated them, and it was the Party's glorious agricultural collectivization that guided them onto the broad road of happiness and prosperity.
    Throughout the day at the cooperative, we were immersed in an ocean of friendship. Orchard workers broke off branches of golden persimmons from the trees, leaves and all, and stuffed them into our hands. Next to the cotton fields, some members danced for our arrival. The cooperative prepared an extremely sumptuous lunch for us. From their simple and sincere smiling faces, we saw how profound the friendship between China and Albania is. We made many friends that day.
    Among our friends, there is also a poet named Roan. Comrade Roan's father was exiled here by the Zogu Dynasty (the feudal rulers of Albania from 1924 to 1939) twenty-five years ago and died in prison. Comrade Roan himself participated in the battle to liberate this area fifteen years ago. Today, the Party sent him here to participate in a month of manual labor. He has returned to this beloved place.
    The Albania-China Friendship Cooperative is truly an epitome of the changes in the countryside of the People's Republic of Albania over the past fifteen years, as the poet described in his poem "My Village":
    Flowers are blooming in the gardens,
    Crops are growing strong on the plains,
    Yesterday's barrenness has disappeared here,
    I no longer recognize my own village.

### 一枝新开的友谊花——访阿中友好农业生产合作社

    一枝新开的友谊花
    ——访阿中友好农业生产合作社
    范承祚
    那是9月下旬，在贝拉特城为我国建国十周年所举行的庆祝大会上，一位朴实的农民登上主席台讲话，他说：“我们刚刚成立的联合社，为庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年，全体社员一致通过把我们的社命名为阿中友好农业生产合作社。”
    应阿中友好合作社之邀，在阿尔巴尼亚解放十五周年光荣的节日前夕，我们前往作客。十五公里长的贝拉特林荫大道，像一条绿色的长蛟，把我们引向拉巴达村的方向。路左边，透过一棵棵高大的白杨树，是一片泛着银浪的大块棉田，一直延伸到远处山脚。以蔚蓝的天幕为背景，村庄和躺在山坡上的翠绿果园向我们移近了。
    这就是刚刚由莫拉瓦和拉巴达两个农业合作社并成的阿中友好合作社，是贝拉特区最大的农业合作社之一。在这两个村子里，我们像在自己家里一样，度过了难忘的一天。
    阿中友好合作社丰收在望的四百公顷大面积的棉田，棉铃累累，银花满枝的棉桃大而且多。合作社主任萨迪克告诉我们，阿中友好合作社前身的莫拉瓦和拉巴达合作社去年平均都获得了每公顷十六公担的棉花收成，而今年则将增加到十七公担，为迎接中华人民共和国成立十周年和阿中友好合作社的命名，全体社员一致把今年计划的上缴给国家的棉花总值四千万里克（阿币）增为四千五百万里克，作为献礼。
    十多年前，这里还没有一公顷棉田，也没有一个人懂得植棉。党把社主任萨迪克派到苏联塔什干去学习了植棉经验。曾几何时，现在这里已经成了“白金之区”。当我国帮助阿尔巴尼亚在贝拉特城兴建的纺织厂落成以后，阿中友好合作社将把现有的四百公顷棉田扩展到一千公顷以上，专门产棉，以支援这座象征着阿中友谊结晶的棉织厂生产。
    阿中友好合作社真是五谷丰登。在这个社的一千八百公顷种植面积里，有一千二百公顷种植粮食作物，机耕面积已达95％。去年的小麦、玉米的单位面积产量均比战前1938年提高了四倍半和两倍。社员们几年来把满是荆棘丛林的山坡谷地，开成了一百一十公顷果园和葡萄园，建立了拥有一百十五头乳牛的畜牧业部门，此外还有修理农具的小型作坊。
    合作社生产的大发展，大大地改变了两个村子的面貌，提高了社员的收入。全社共有三百五十户，有一千一百个劳动力。在1950年建社之初，平均每个劳动日为二公斤粮食和十二里克，而去年已达到三公斤粮食和一百三十一里克。今年合作社的基金已达四千万里克，几乎等于去年收获的六千多公担棉花的总值。
    社会主义文化革命的光芒已经照亮了这两个村庄，四十岁以下的文盲早在1955年就扫除了，家家的孩子都上了学，而且去年已经破天荒第一次地有两个社内的小伙子进入了地拉那大学。这对于被旧社会遗忘了的文化极端落后的农村来说，不能不算是一件大事。
    十五年前，这里可不是这样。
    莫拉瓦和拉巴达都是座落在富饶的贝拉特平原上，这里的农民向来就勤劳，可是解放前他们世世代代都过不了好日子。这里阳光好，雨量足，可是他们种出的粮食并不属于自己，每年维持不了四个月口粮。包括莫拉瓦和拉巴达两个村庄的整个贝拉特平原上的土地，解放前都是属于阿尔巴尼亚最大的地主之一——弗里奥尼，他一家拥有的土地就达六千三百多公顷。
    现在，年纪较大的农民还清楚地记得弗里奥尼每次来到拉巴达村的情景，他身披大衣，手执皮鞭，左右跟着两个护身的卫士。农民见到他时，五十步以外就得弯腰曲背，躬身行礼，或者跪在一旁等他走后方能起来。他每次“光临”，都照例有人倒霉。阿中友好合作社八十岁的老农民恰乌什因欠地主的债，一生中有十二次被地主赶出自己的家，连那不透阳光、没有炉灶的草房都不让他住。
    莫拉瓦和拉巴达两个村的今昔是多么鲜明的天壤之别啊！今年11月29日是阿中友好合作社的双重节日。社员们在庆祝祖国解放十五周年的同时，将庆祝莫拉瓦建社七周年。是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党解放了他们，是党的农业合作化光辉引导他们走上幸福富裕的康庄大道。
    在合作社的一整天，我们浸沉在友谊的海洋里。果园工人把连枝带叶的成串的金黄柿子从树上折下塞到我们手里，在棉田旁边，一些社员为我们的来到跳起舞来，合作社为我们准备了极其丰盛的午餐。我们从他们那朴实而真诚的笑脸上，看到了中阿友谊是多么深厚。这一天我们结交了许多朋友。
    在我们的这些朋友当中，还有一位诗人罗安。罗安同志的父亲二十五年前被索古王朝（1924—1939年阿尔巴尼亚的封建统治者）流放到这里而囚死，罗安同志本人十五年前参加了解放这个地区的战斗，今天党派他来这里参加为期一月的体力劳动，他又回到了这个心爱的地方。
    阿中友好合作社真是阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国十五年来农村面貌改变的一个缩影，正如这位诗人在他的“我村”一诗中描写的：
    园地里鲜花怒放，
    平原上庄稼茁壮，
    这里已消逝了昨天的荒凉，
    我已不再认识自己的村庄。
