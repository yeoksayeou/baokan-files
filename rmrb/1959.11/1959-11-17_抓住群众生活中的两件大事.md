A short commentary:

    Grasping two major matters in the people's lives
    Maintaining close ties with the masses and caring for their lives is a glorious tradition of the Chinese Communist Party and one of its fundamental characteristics that distinguishes it from any other political party. As early as 1934, Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly pointed out in his article "Pay Attention to Economic Problems and to the Work of Supplying the Masses": "We should pay close attention to the problems of the masses' lives, from land and labor problems to the problems of firewood, rice, cooking oil and salt. Women want to learn how to plow, who will teach them? Children want to go to school, are the primary schools set up? The wooden bridge across the way is too small and people fall, should it be repaired? Many people have sores and illnesses, what can be done? All these problems of the masses' lives should be put on the agenda. They should be discussed, decided, implemented, and checked." Over the years, under the guidance of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the broad masses of cadres have paid great attention to the people's livelihood, helping them solve practical difficulties in their lives, thus the Party and the masses have always maintained close ties, successfully completed the tasks of democratic revolution and socialist transformation, and are leading the masses in the victorious socialist construction.
    The people's communization has created more favorable conditions for solving the people's livelihood problems. The people's commune is not only the organizer of the people's production, but also the organizer of the people's lives. It can use the power of the large collective to develop production faster and properly solve the people's livelihood problems on the basis of production development.
    In the past year, many leading cadres and staff members of the people's communes have devoted sufficient energy to grasping people's lives while grasping production. Even when there were no problems with the masses' lives, the leadership was already planning ahead and making arrangements for the masses' lives. The timely leadership of the Liling and You County committees of Hunan Province in leading the masses to plant vegetables and store firewood after the autumn harvest, and preparing for vegetables and firewood for this winter and next spring, is a vivid example of the Party's concern for both the masses' production and the masses' lives.
    Some people may regard the problems of eating vegetables and burning firewood as "trivial matters of life" and not worth mentioning. However, in the eyes of Communists who have always cared about the people's lives, they are major matters that are of great importance and cannot be taken lightly. Everyone gets hungry and needs to eat, and to eat well and have enough, you need vegetables; cooking rice and vegetables requires firewood, and in the cold winter days, you need firewood for heating. Without vegetables and firewood, you cannot cook, and you cannot eat well. If you don't eat well and don't get enough to eat, and if you don't have a fire to warm yourself in the cold winter snow, your health will be affected. It is inconceivable that without a healthy body, a person can maintain constant vigor and energy. Therefore, for the sake of a bumper harvest in agricultural production next year, we must now care about and solve the masses' problems of eating vegetables, burning firewood, and all other necessary problems in the masses' lives. Only in this way can the masses be full of energy and devote themselves to the winter production campaign centered on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation without any worries, and prepare everything for next year's bumper harvest.
    When solving the problems of the masses' eating vegetables, burning firewood, and other livelihood issues this winter and next spring, all localities should, like the Liling and You County committees, see the characteristics after communization. On the one hand, they should organize the broad masses of commune members to first solve the problems of eating vegetables and burning firewood in the public canteens to ensure the needs of collective life; on the other hand, they should also give the commune members a certain amount of time so that they can make the necessary preparations for the firewood needed for their family heating, and also manage the vegetables planted in front of and behind their houses. Such a comprehensive arrangement can ensure the continuous high morale of commune members, and can solve both production and livelihood problems at the same time, providing a strong guarantee for winter production this year and a bumper harvest in agricultural production next year.

    抓住群众生活中的两件大事
    密切联系群众，关心群众生活，是中国共产党的光荣传统，是共产党不同于任何其他政党的基本特征之一。远在1934年毛泽东同志在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文中，就曾经深刻地指出：“我们应该深刻地注意群众生活的问题，从土地、劳动问题，到柴米油盐问题。妇女群众要学习犁耙，找什么人去教她们呢？小孩子要求读书，小学办起了没有呢？对面的木桥太小会跌倒行人，要不要修理一下呢？许多人生疮害病，想个什么办法呢？一切这些群众生活上的问题，都应该把它提到议事日程上。应该讨论，应该决定，应该实行，应该检查。”许多年来，在党和毛泽东同志的教导下，广大干部都很注意群众的生活问题，帮助群众解决生活中的实际困难，因而党和群众始终保持着密切的联系，胜利地完成了民主革命和社会主义改造的任务，又领导群众胜利地进行着社会主义建设。
    人民公社化创造了解决群众生活问题的更有利的条件。人民公社不但是人民生产的组织者，也是群众生活的组织者，它可以运用大集体的力量更快地发展生产，并在生产发展的基础上妥善解决群众的生活问题。
    一年来，许多领导干部和人民公社的工作人员在抓生产的同时，也用足够的精力抓生活。甚至当群众生活尚未发生问题的时候，领导上就在为群众的生活未雨绸缪，早作打算和安排。湖南醴陵县和攸县县委在秋收过后，及时领导群众种好蔬菜，储备柴火，作好今冬和明春蔬菜、烧柴准备工作，就是党既关心群众生产又关心群众生活的一个生动事例。
    吃菜和烧柴问题，有些人也许把它看作是“生活小事”，不足挂齿。但是，在一向关心群众生活的共产党人看起来，却是关系非同小可、不可等闲视之的大事。每个人肚子饿了都要吃饭，饭要吃得好、吃得饱，就需要有菜；做饭、做菜都需要柴火，冬季风高天寒，烤火取暖也得要有柴火。没有菜、没有柴，就做不了饭，也吃不好，吃不好、吃不饱，又加上严冬雨雪时没有火烤，身体健康就会受到影响。不能设想，没有健康的身体，一个人会经常保持旺盛的干劲和充沛的精力。因此，为了明年农业生产的大丰收，现在必须关心和解决群众的吃菜问题、烧柴问题，以及其他一切群众生活上必需解决的问题。只有这样，群众才会干劲十足、无牵无挂地投入以兴修水利和积肥为中心的冬季生产运动，也才能为明年的大丰收作好一切准备。
    在解决群众今冬明春的吃菜、烧柴以及其他群众生活问题的时候，各地应当像醴陵县和攸县县委一样，看到公社化以后的特点，一方面组织广大社员首先解决公共食堂的吃菜和烧柴问题，以保证集体生活的需要；另一方面也要给社员以一定时间，使社员能对自己家庭取暖需要的柴火作好必要的准备，对家前屋后所种的蔬菜也能加以管理。这样的全面安排，就能保证社员劳动热情不断高涨，就能把生产问题和生活问题同时解决，为今年冬季生产和明年农业生产大丰收提供有力的保证。
