Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 19th:  In implementing the policy of "walking on two legs," the transportation departments of Sichuan Province are vigorously repairing light railways and earth railways.  By the end of October, the province had completed and opened to traffic 137 kilometers of light railways and earth railways this year; another 183 kilometers are under accelerated construction and are expected to be fully operational before the end of the year.

With the development of industrial and agricultural production, the volume of freight transportation in various parts of Sichuan Province has grown rapidly, especially the transportation tasks of steel, coke, and ore, which are even more arduous. Existing railways and highways cannot fully meet the needs. Most of these newly built light railways and earth railways are located near important industrial and mining areas. For example, the Xiaogan Railway (Xiaoyutuo, Qijiang - Ganshui) that has been completed and opened to traffic connects Xiaoyutuo, the location of the largest iron ore area in the province, Qijiang Iron Ore, with the Ganshui Station of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, more than ten kilometers away. In the past, these two places were connected only by a narrow highway. A large amount of iron ore produced by the Qijiang Iron Mine was transported to Ganshui by car or manpower, and then transferred by train to Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, Sanjiang Iron and Steel Plant, and iron smelting plants along the railway. Due to the small transportation capacity, a large amount of ore could not be transported in time, which affected the raw material supply of these iron plants. After the Xiaogan Railway is opened to traffic, the ore can be directly transported to various factories. The De'tian Railway under construction will also connect the new coal and coke base of Sichuan Province, Tianchi in Mianzhu County, with the Baoji-Chengdu Railway.

Light railways and earth railways are quick to build, require less investment, and yield significant results. Using small locomotives or automobile traction, the technology is simple and easy to master. (Attached picture)

    沟通重要厂矿  加快物资运输
    发展轻便铁路土铁路
    四川已建成一百三十七公里
    据新华社成都19日电　四川省交通运输部门贯彻两条腿走路的方针，大修轻便铁路和土铁路。到10月底止，全省今年已建成通车的轻便铁路和土铁路有一百三十七公里；另有一百八十三公里正在加快建设，预计年底前可以全部通车。
    随着工农业生产的发展，四川省各地货物运输量增长很快，特别是钢铁、煤焦、矿石的运输任务更为繁重，现有的铁路和公路不能完全满足需要。新修的这些轻便铁路和土铁路大部分在重要的工矿区附近。如已建成通车的小（綦江小鱼沱）赶（赶水）铁路沟通了全省目前最大的铁矿区——綦江铁矿所在地小鱼沱同十多公里以外川黔铁路赶水车站的交通。过去这两个地方只有一条狭窄的公路相通，綦江铁矿生产的大量铁矿石用汽车或人力运到赶水，再由火车转运到重庆钢铁公司、三江钢铁厂及铁路沿线的炼铁厂。由于运输能力小，大量矿石无法及时运出，使这些铁厂的原料供应受到影响。小赶铁路通车后，就可把矿石直接运到各厂去。正在建设的德天铁路，也将把四川省新的煤焦基地——绵竹县天池和宝成铁路联系起来。
    轻便铁路和土铁路建设快，投资少，收效大。使用小型机车或汽车牵引，技术简单，容易掌握。（附图片）
