Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 21st. Henan Province's winter-sown wheat has all emerged, and most are tillering. People's communes everywhere are launching wheat field management competitions centered on striving for "full and strong seedlings in every mu, and high yields and bumper harvests in every field."

　　By the 17th, over 10 million mu of wheat fields in the province that were missing seedlings or had broken rows had been replanted. Over 31 million mu had received the first application of fertilizer, and over 4.81 million mu had received the second application; more than 8 million mu have been cultivated and harrowed. The more than 5 million mu of wheat fields affected by pests have also been treated once. In mid-November, the province experienced successive rainfall and snowfall, which further promoted the healthy growth of wheat seedlings. The vast fields of fertile land already present a lush green scene.

　　This year, Henan Province's winter wheat field management work started early, was of high quality, had great momentum, and was full of enthusiasm. Many people's communes adopted the method of managing while sowing, so the emergence of wheat seedlings was generally more uniform and robust than in previous years. Before wheat sowing was finished, each county in the Kaifeng area put forward the requirement of "not missing a seedling in a thousand mu, not missing an inch of land," and successively launched three upsurges of checking and replanting seedlings. The ? county people's communes in this area also implemented seedling cultivation and transplantation methods, so that more than 3,800 mu of wheat fields lacking seedlings or with broken rows quickly caught up with wheat fields with full and strong seedlings. Xinxiang, Xinyang, Nanyang, Xuchang, Luoyang and other areas and counties, as soon as wheat sowing ended, proposed to strive for all wheat fields to reach the first-class seedling standard. Xinyang area counties carried out the "late stubble surpassing early stubble," "mountain areas catching up with plains," "scientific management," "high quality, high efficiency," and "every commune, every team, everyone is red" "five red" competition, the whole area's daily fertilizer application speed is more than doubled compared with the same period last year. In Huaxian County, Xinxiang area, files have been generally established for more than 1,158,000 mu of wheat, replenishing what is lacking, and after careful processing, the county's original 750,000 mu of first-class seedlings has now increased to 810,000 mu; 46,000 mu of the 130,000 mu of third-class seedlings have been eliminated.

　　In the wheat field management campaign, Party committee secretaries at all levels took the lead and strengthened leadership over this work. This year, among the 24 million mu of high-yield wheat fields planned throughout the province, 8.9 million mu are directly led by the prefectural and county party committees. People's communes everywhere have also implemented a system of responsibility, with secretaries in charge of areas, committee members in charge of brigades, and branch secretaries in charge of production teams. Due to insufficient base moisture and rising salinity, some wheat seedlings in the 40,000 mu of saline-alkali land sown in Yanjin County showed signs of yellowing and dry tips. After learning about this situation, the CPC Yanjin County Committee immediately organized more than 7,500 technicians to conduct in-depth field consultations, focusing on the root cause of wheat seedlings lacking sufficient nutrients, and after rushing to water and fertilize, they have changed from yellow to green.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 21st. Since the end of October, members of people's communes in various parts of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have been grasping wheat field management, striving to manage winter wheat well and carefully, and ensuring that every wheat field has full and strong seedlings.

　　This year, the area of winter wheat in Xinjiang has expanded compared to last year. Winter wheat was planted quickly and well, and the growth is better than in previous years, generally with about 350,000 seedlings per mu. However, after inspections in various places, there are still some wheat fields with poor seedling emergence, and some even have missing seedlings or broken rows. As soon as the wheat seedlings emerged from the soil, people's communes everywhere organized professional teams, divided areas and contracted tasks, checked and replanted, and were responsible to the end. According to statistics from the Tacheng area, the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture, and Turpan, Shanshan, and Toksun, the area of checking and replanting seedlings has reached about 8% of the winter wheat planting area. In order to promote third-class seedlings to catch up with first-class seedlings, various places organized a large number of fertilizer application teams while checking and replanting seedlings, checking one piece, replenishing one piece, and applying fertilizer to one piece. In Makit and Yuepuhu counties in southern Xinjiang, 123,000 mu of winter wheat have already received one application of fertilizer. At present, the winter manure accumulation campaign is forming a climax.

　　The prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, which was carried out in the spring in previous years, was launched throughout the region from mid-October this year with a two-pronged approach of air and ground prevention and control. In the Kashgar and Aksu areas, where wheat aphids, cutworms, wheat stem flies, and wheat rust were found, 670,000 mu have been treated by aircraft, with a kill rate of over 80%. The pest control professional teams of various people's communes also used a large number of plant ash-lime-sulfur mixtures, 666 and other pesticide powders for ground control. The total area of prevention and control is close to one million mu. The winter wheat that has been treated has escaped the harm of diseases and insect pests.

　　In order to completely eliminate overwintering pests and strengthen soil moisture conservation for the coming year, various places have recently diverted winter idle water to irrigate more than 7.48 million mu of winter wheat, of which Hami, Altay and Bayingol Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture, Bortala Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture have completed their winter irrigation plans.

    确保块块麦田苗全苗壮
    河南一千多万亩缺苗断垅麦田补种完毕  新疆各公社补苗追肥治虫加强田间管理
    据新华社郑州21日电　河南省冬播小麦已经全部出苗，大部分分蘖。各地人民公社正在以争取“亩亩苗全苗壮、块块高产丰收”为中心，展开麦田管理竞赛。
    到17日止，全省一千多万亩缺苗断垅的麦田，已经补种完毕。有三千一百多万亩追了第一遍肥，四百八十一万多亩追肥第二遍；中耕、耙耱八百多万亩。发生虫害的五百多万亩麦田，也已经普治了一遍。11月中旬，全省先后降雨和下雪，更加促进了麦苗健壮生长。千里沃野已经呈现一片葱绿景象。
    今年，河南省冬播小麦田间管理工作动手早、质量高、声势大、干劲足。许多人民公社采用了边播种、边管理的办法，因而，小麦出苗普遍比往年整齐茁壮。开封专区各县在麦播还没有结束之前，就提出了“千苗不缺寸垅、百亩不缺一苗”的要求，先后掀起了三次查苗补苗高潮。这个专区的?县各人民公社还实行了育苗移栽的办法，使三千八百多亩缺苗断垅的麦田，很快赶上了苗全苗壮的麦田。新乡、信阳、南阳、许昌、洛阳等专区各县，在麦播一结束，就提出了争取全部麦田达到一类苗。信阳专区各县开展了“晚茬超早茬”、“山区赶平原”、“管理科学化”、“高质量、高工效”、“社社、队队、人人红”的“五红”竞赛，全区每天追肥速度比去年同期加快二倍多。新乡专区滑县一百一十五万八千多亩小麦普遍建立了档案，缺啥补啥，经过细致地加工，全县原有七十五万亩一类苗，现在已增加到八十一万亩；十三万亩三类苗已消灭了四万六千亩。
    在麦田管理运动中，各地党组织书记挂帅，加强了对这一工作的领导。今年，全省规划的二千四百万亩小麦丰产方中，由地委和县委直接领导的就有八百九十万亩。各地人民公社也都实行了书记包片，委员包大队、支书包生产队的分片包干责任制。延津县播种的四万亩盐碱地小麦，由于底墒不足，盐碱复升，一部分麦苗呈现枯黄、干尖现象，中共延津县委了解到这一情况后，立即组织了七千五百多名技术员，深入田间会诊，针对麦苗缺乏充足养分的病根，突击浇水、追肥以后，已经由黄变绿。
    新华社乌鲁木齐21日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各地人民公社社员，从10月下旬以来，就抓紧小麦田间管理，力争把冬麦管好、管细，保证麦田块块苗全苗壮。
    今年新疆的冬麦面积比去年扩大。冬小麦种得快、种得好，生长情况胜过往年，一般每亩出苗三十五万株左右。但是，经各地检查，仍然有部分麦田出苗差，有的还出现缺苗断垅现象。麦苗刚露出土，各地人民公社就组织专业队，分片包干，边查边补，负责到底，据塔城专区、克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州和吐鲁番、鄯善、托克逊等地统计，查苗补苗的面积已达冬麦播种面积的8％左右。为了促使三类苗赶上一类苗，各地在查苗补苗的时候，组织了大批追肥队，查一块、补一块、追肥一块。南疆麦盖提和岳普湖县有十二万三千亩冬麦已经追施了一次肥料。目前，冬季积肥运动正在形成高潮。
    往年都在春天进行的防治病虫害工作，今年从10月中旬起，全区就展开了天空地面两夹攻的防治病虫害工作。在发现麦蚜、地老虎、麦秆蝇、麦锈病的喀什、阿克苏等专区，已用飞机防治六十七万亩，杀伤效果达80％以上，各人民公社的治虫专业队，也大量采用草木灰石灰硫磺合剂、六六六等药粉，在地面防治。防治总面积接近百万亩。经过防治的冬麦已脱离了病虫危害。
    为了彻底消灭越冬虫害和加强来年保墒工作，最近以来各地已引冬闲水灌溉冬麦七百四十八万多亩，其中哈密、阿勒泰两专区和巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州、博尔塔拉蒙古族自治州等地都已完成了冬灌计划。
