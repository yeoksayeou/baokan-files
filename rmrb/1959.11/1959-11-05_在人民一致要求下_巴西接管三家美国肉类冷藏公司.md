    Xinhua News Agency, November 4th, Rio de Janeiro dispatch: The Brazilian government has taken over four foreign meat refrigeration companies that monopolize Brazilian meat. Three of these belong to American capital and one to British capital. These companies will now be operated by the government's Price Management Committee.
    These American and British companies had resisted government regulations prohibiting raising meat prices by hoarding meat, artificially creating a tense situation in the meat supply, thereby arousing strong public dissatisfaction. Under the unanimous demands of the Brazilian people and parliamentarians, the Brazilian government had expressed a month ago that it would nationalize foreign refrigeration enterprises. The American and British ambassadors to Brazil had met with Brazilian President Kubitschek, attempting to interfere with the nationalization of the refrigeration enterprises, but failed.

    在人民一致要求下
    巴西接管三家美国肉类冷藏公司
    新华社4日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西政府接管了四家垄断巴西肉类的外国肉类冷藏公司。其中三家属于美国资本，一家英国资本。这几家公司今后将由政府的价格管理委员会来经营。
    这些美英公司曾以囤积肉类来抗拒政府关于不准抬高肉价的规定，人为地制造肉类供应的紧张状况，从而引起公众的强烈不满。在巴西人民和议员的一致要求下，巴西政府在一个月以前就表示过要把外国冷藏企业收归国有。美国和英国驻巴西大使曾同巴西总统库比契克会谈，力图干预冷藏企业国有化的工作，但遭到了失败。
