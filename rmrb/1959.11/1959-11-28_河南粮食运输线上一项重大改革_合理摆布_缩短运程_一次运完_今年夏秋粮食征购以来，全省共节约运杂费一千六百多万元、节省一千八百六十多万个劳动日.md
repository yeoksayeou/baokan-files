    A Major Reform on the Henan Grain Transportation Line
    Rational Arrangement, Shortened Transportation Distance, Complete Transportation at Once.
    Since the summer and autumn grain procurement this year, the province has saved more than 16 million yuan in transportation costs and more than 18.6 million workdays.
    Zhengzhou, November 27th (Our Newspaper) – In conjunction with the summer and autumn grain procurement, various localities in Henan Province have carried out rational grain distribution work, transporting the procured grain from the people's communes or production brigades directly to transportation lines, supply points, processing plants, and warehouses for long-term storage. This has essentially eliminated the practice of first transferring the grain to local state granaries and then carrying out two short-distance centralized transports. As of November 12th, while overfulfilling this year's annual grain procurement target, 91% of the grain that needs to be transferred out of the counties has been transported to railway, highway, and river wharves along transportation lines, ready for timely outward transfer or storage. Also, 90% of the grain for internal surplus and deficiency adjustment, processing, and storage within the counties has been transported to grassroots grain supply points, county grain processing plants, and reserve grain warehouses in one go.
    Combining grain procurement and rational distribution for a one-time completion is a major reform on the grain front. It not only ensures sufficient grain supply along transportation lines, guaranteeing the completion of outward transfer tasks, but also greatly saves social transportation capacity and reduces national expenditure by avoiding counter-directional, roundabout, and backflow phenomena during secondary centralized transport, and reducing one loading and unloading procedure. Henan Province has earnestly promoted this experience this year. From July to October, the province overfulfilled the grain outward transfer task every month, and the outward transfer task in the first half of November was also overfulfilled. Preliminary calculations show that since the summer and autumn grain procurement this year, the province has saved a total of 16,250,000 yuan in various transportation costs, 18,660,000 workdays, and more than 12 million animal trips.
    When formulating the rational grain distribution plan, various localities in Henan Province, based on the principles of facilitating supply, transfer, and storage, referred to the state grain allocation plan, direct transportation, and local transportation conditions. First, the people's communes put forward their preliminary opinions, which were submitted to the county grain bureau for review, summarization, and balancing. Finally, they were reported to the county party committee for approval and issued to various places before the start of the grain procurement work, widely publicized and implemented, so that each commune and team knew in advance the location, quantity, variety, and time limit for delivering grain to the warehouse. For communes and teams that delivered grain to the warehouse according to the rational distribution plan and exceeded the obligatory transportation distance, the state paid the freight according to regulations. In remote areas far from traffic arteries, relay stations or temporary transfer stations were set up in the middle, and the grain department organized professional transportation forces. When the communes and teams in remote areas delivered the grain, the relay stations directly concentrated the grain to the transportation lines. During the implementation process, the grain headquarters at the provincial, prefectural, county, and commune levels not only grasped the procurement progress but also grasped the rational distribution, so that while the procurement task was completed, the grain was also distributed at one time to transportation lines, supply points, processing plants, and state granaries for long-term storage.

    河南粮食运输线上一项重大改革
    合理摆布　缩短运程　一次运完
    今年夏秋粮食征购以来，全省共节约运杂费一千六百多万元、节省一千八百六十多万个劳动日
    本报郑州27日电　河南省各地结合夏秋粮食征购，进行粮食合理摆布工作，把征购的粮食从各人民公社或生产大队一次摆到交通沿线、供应点、加工厂和供长期贮备的仓库，基本上消灭了先就近调入当地的国家粮仓，而后再进行两次短途集运的现象。11月12日在全省超额完成今年全年粮食征购任务的同时，属于各县需要外调的粮食，已有91％集运到了铁路、公路、河流沿线的车站码头，及时向外调运或贮存了起来；属于各县内部余缺调剂、加工和贮备的粮食，也有90％一次调运到了基层粮食供应点、县内粮食加工厂和贮备粮仓库。
    把粮食征购和合理摆布结合进行，一次完成，是粮食战线上的一项重大改革。它不仅使交通沿线粮源充足，及时保证外调任务的完成，还由于避免了二次集运中的相向、迂回、倒流现象，减少了一次装卸手续，从而大大节省了社会运输力，降低了国家费用开支。今年河南省认真推行了这项经验，从7月到10月，全省月月超额完成了粮食外调任务，11月上半月的外调任务也超额完成了。初步计算，今年夏秋粮食征购以来，全省共节省了各种运杂费一千六百二十五万元，一千八百六十六万多劳动日，一千二百多万头次的牲畜。
    在制订粮食合理摆布规划时，河南省各地都本着有利供应、调运和保管的原则，参照了国家粮食调拨计划，直线运输和当地的交通条件，先由各人民公社提出各自的初步意见，交县粮食局审查、汇总进行平衡，最后报请县委定案，于粮食征购工作开始前，及早下达各地，广泛宣传贯彻，使各社、队事先都知道自己送粮入库的地点、数量、品种和期限。国家对于按照合理摆布规划送粮入库超过义务运程的社、队，按规定付给运费；对距离交通干线较远的偏僻地区，在中途设立接力站或临时转运站，由粮食部门组织专业运输力量，当偏远地区的社、队把粮食送到后，直接由接力站向交通沿线集运。贯彻执行过程中，省、专、县、社各级粮食指挥部既抓征购进度，又抓合理摆布，这样在征购任务完成的同时，也把粮食一次摆布到了交通沿线、供应点、加工厂和供长期贮备的国家粮仓。（附图片）
