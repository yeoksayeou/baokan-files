    "Industry and Commerce, What's the Need to Differentiate!"
    The shrill ringing of the telephone echoed in the supply and marketing office of the Xinghuo Cotton Weaving Factory. The person in charge had just stepped out, and only Wang Qichang, a processing staff member from the Textile Products Purchasing Station, was sitting there. He answered the phone in place of the person in charge. Coincidentally, the caller was Old Xu, an acquaintance from the workshop. They needed to collect five bolts of yarn from the Textile Products Station, but the factory's truck was helping the Datong Dyeing and Weaving Factory transport goods. The workshop was short of people and requested the factory leadership to immediately send support. As Old Wang listened, he thought, "The Xinghuo Factory's task is tight this month. I've come to the factory as a processing staff member, I can't just be here to ask for goods, can I?" When Old Xu finished speaking, he resolutely agreed: "Okay, we'll send someone to help you right away." Old Xu in the workshop was a bit disbelieving when he heard that the factory was sending Old Wang to help haul the yarn. Old Wang said, "Industry and commerce, what's the need to differentiate!"
    The small flatbed cart rolled out of the Hanzhongmen warehouse of the Textile Products Purchasing Station, loaded with five bolts of yarn. In the past, three people could only haul a maximum of four bolts of yarn at a time. Now, one cart was carrying five bolts of yarn, truly breaking the historical record for workers hauling carts.
    When Comrade Wang Qichang and everyone else hauled the yarn to the "Xinghuo" sizing workshop, they heard the rhythmic sound of the looms coming from the workshop. Although beads of sweat were streaming down their foreheads, they felt an indescribable joy in their hearts.

    “工商还分什么家！”
    星火棉织厂供销科办公室里响起了一阵急促的电话铃声，主人刚出去，只有纺织品采购站来的加工员王其昌坐在那里。他代替主人接了电话。正巧打电话的人是车间的熟人老许，他们要到纺织品站去领五件纱，但厂里的车子帮助大同染织厂运货去了，车间人少，要求厂部马上派人支援。老王一边听着，一边想：“星火厂这个月任务紧，我这个加工员下厂来不能光是伸手要货？……”他等老许话一落音，就毅然答应：“好，马上派人来协助你们。”车间老许听说是厂里派老王来协助拖纱，有点不相信，老王说“工商还分什么家！”
    小板车从纺织品采购站汉中门仓库出来的时候，上面码的是五件纱。过去三人一次顶多拖四件纱，现在一车载五件纱，真是打破了工人拖车的历史纪录。
    当王其昌同志和大家把纱拖到“星火”浆纱车间的时候，听到车间传出来有节奏的织布机声，额头上虽然汗珠直淌，心里头却是感到一种说不出的快乐。
