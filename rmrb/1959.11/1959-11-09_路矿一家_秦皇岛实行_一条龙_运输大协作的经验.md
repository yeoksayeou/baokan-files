Road and Mine as One Family
——The Experience of Qinhuangdao in Implementing "One-Dragon" Transportation Collaboration

	Great Collaboration, Great Strength
	Qinhuangdao Port is one of the six major coastal ports in China and an important port for domestic import and export materials. Due to the increasing development of China's industrial and agricultural production and international trade, the port's throughput and the station's freight volume have increased year after year, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, when the volume of transportation soared. In 1958, the port's throughput increased by 22% compared with 1957, and the planned throughput for 1959 increased by 62% compared with 1958. The number of railway loading and unloading cars increased by 6% in 1958 compared with 1957, and by 51% in 1959 compared with 1958. With the rapid growth of the port's throughput and the number of station loading and unloading cars, the contradiction of insufficient transportation capacity and the port's inadequate throughput capacity emerged. This contradiction was rapidly resolved after the implementation of extensive collaboration.
	Stations and ports are the connecting points between trains and ships and the hubs of the entire land and water transportation. More than 90% of the goods sent by the station are transferred through the port; almost all of the goods handled by the port are transferred through the station. The relationship between the road and the port is as close as lips and teeth. However, trains and ships have different requirements, and their operations are very unbalanced. Therefore, there have been long-standing contradictions between roads and ports. Because the port is solely responsible for the loading and unloading operations of trains and ships, it has become the focal point of contradictions. After the rectification movement, the vast number of employees of both the road and the port eliminated departmentalism and established the idea of "one chess game"; then, they learned from the collaborative experiences of fraternal units such as Fuxin and Benxi, and gradually implemented the "twelve unifications" of the road and the port, namely: unification of thought, unification of plans, unification of organizational structure, unification of shifts, unification of indicators, unification of measures, unification of task assignments, unification of operational processes, unification of equipment and labor usage, unification of competitions, unification of reports, and unification of summaries, and began to form a new collaborative relationship. In April of this year, the vast number of employees, based on the characteristics of land-water combined transportation, creatively carried out the "one-dragon" comprehensive collaboration. Its general content is to use the transshipment port and station as the hub, link the red flag trains and scheduled ships of fraternal units, comprehensively organize the large-scale collaboration of mines, roads, ports, ships, and cargo, and form a continuous operation organization throughout the entire land and water journey, thereby achieving the purpose of accelerating the turnover of trains, ships, and cargo.
	Through large-scale collaboration, the throughput capacity of the port and station has been expanded, the turnover of trains, ships, and cargo has been accelerated, and it has been well received by all parties. In the first half of this year, with basically no increase in the equipment capacity of roads and ports, the completed throughput increased 1.8 times compared with the same period last year; the number of railway loading and unloading vehicles increased nearly doubled compared with the same period last year; the direct transshipment volume of trains and ships accounted for 35% of the throughput, an increase of 1.2 times compared with the same period last year; the unit cost of loading and unloading decreased by 38% compared with the same period last year; and the average operating time of vehicles for one operation was shortened by 44% compared with the same period last year. Since the second quarter, due to the gradual development of the "one-dragon" comprehensive collaboration, transportation efficiency has been significantly improved. Compared with the first quarter, the shortening of vehicle turnaround time in the second quarter resulted in 65,000 vehicle-hours being excavated, equivalent to adding more than 1,800 railcars of transportation capacity between Qinhuangdao and Fuxin; ships shortened their operating ton-days by more than 650,000, equivalent to adding a 7,200-ton ship for the entire quarter.
	"Three Breakings" and "Three Establishments"
	The "one-dragon" comprehensive collaboration is the product of continuous revolution, continuous development, and continuous improvement under the leadership of the Party; it is the result of the continuous improvement of the ideological understanding of the vast number of employees. To do a good job in large-scale collaboration, it is necessary to put politics in command and first improve ideological understanding.
	Before 1956, the relationship between roads and ports was mainly restricted by contracts. Although contracts also played a certain role in promoting production, due to the departmentalism that existed on both sides of the road and the port, they were uncoordinated, which caused losses to the work.
	The great rectification movement was a turning point in road-port collaboration. At the road-port leading cadres' collaboration meeting personally presided over by the municipal party secretary, they examined their thoughts in the spirit of starting from the overall situation and thinking for the other party. Then, they mobilized business personnel to launch a large-scale airing of views, blooming, posting of big-character posters, and debates on the four questions of the focus of past disputes, the reasons for buck-passing, the losses caused, and what to do in the future. In the Double-Anti Movement, they also organized all employees to carry out a two-and-a-half-month struggle against departmentalist ideology. This series of collectivist education played the role of three breakings and three establishments: breaking down departmentalism and establishing a global perspective; breaking down the idea of mutual distrust and non-disclosure between roads and ports, and establishing the idea of unity and collaboration and the road and port being one family; breaking down the remaining capitalist management viewpoints and establishing socialist management thinking. Since then, from top to bottom, both sides have taken the initiative to contact each other, visit each other, send each other guarantee conditions, and promote a collaborative style. With the improvement of the ideological awareness of the employees, the leaders of both sides, after research, implemented "four unifications": unification of shifts, plans, indicators, and competitions, so that roads and ports established a new collaborative relationship. However, because the dispatch and command systems of both sides were independent and the technical operation process was complicated, it still affected the unification of dispatch and command and the full play of the hub role of land and water transportation, hindering the rapid improvement of transportation efficiency. At the beginning of this year, according to the instructions of the municipal party committee, they conducted ideological education on "the whole country as one chess game" for all employees, and led employees to carry out the "five satisfactions" movement. The core of the "five satisfactions" is: strive to improve one's own work, leave difficulties to oneself, provide convenience to others, and achieve the satisfaction of employees in the five aspects of mines, roads, ports (opposite port), ships, and cargo. Through education, employees further clarified the importance of doing a good job in collaboration. On this ideological basis, they expanded the content of collaboration and implemented the "ten unifications" of road-port collaboration. Because the awareness of employees on both sides continued to improve, and they were dissatisfied with the situation of the separation of organizational structures, the party organizations on both sides, after research, unified the organizational structures and unified and simplified the technical operation process, becoming "twelve unifications," making the train and ship operation command form an organic whole. Since then, road-port collaboration has moved to a higher stage; ideologically and organizationally, the road and the port have truly become one family.
	After the road-port collaboration problem was solved, the contradiction of uncoordinated train and ship operation organization still existed, affecting the smooth progress of transshipment operations. This proves that, according to the characteristics of land-water combined transportation, it is not enough to simply do a good job in the collaboration of the port station itself, but it is also necessary to closely connect the train and ship operation organization and organize the direct transshipment of trains and ships as much as possible. In this way, the turnover of train and ship cargo can be accelerated to the maximum extent, the port station throughput capacity can be greatly improved, the loading and unloading operation coefficient can be reduced, and a lot of manpower and material resources can be saved. Therefore, under the leadership and support of the higher authorities, they took the initiative to contact fraternal units and extended and developed the collaboration to the water and land sides. In April of this year, they negotiated with the Beijing Railway Bureau and signed a direct train agreement between Fuxin and Qinhuangdao. Then, they opened the Red Flag direct train between Guye and Qinhuangdao, and jointly signed the Qin-Shen line ship scheduled and fixed route agreement with the Shanghai Maritime Bureau and Shanghai Port. The Red Flag train guarantees the arrival of coal on time and in quantity, and the scheduled and fixed route of ships guarantees timely pick-up and delivery. This has increased the collaborative form from "twelve unifications" to "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration, from road-port collaboration to comprehensive large-scale collaboration of mines, roads, ports, ships, and cargo, making the entire land-water transportation form a collaborative network with connected ends.
	Internal Large-Scale Collaboration Achieves "One-Dragon"
	Road-port internal collaboration is the foundation of "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration; to do a good job in "one-dragon" comprehensive large-scale collaboration, it is necessary to do a good job in road-port internal large-scale collaboration. Therefore, focusing on the center of shortening ship periods, train turnaround time, and accelerating cargo turnover, they firmly grasped the ideological education of "one chess game," established collaborative models, and listed collaboration as one of the contents of the Red Flag competition, so that the road-port internal collaboration rapidly unfolded. Now, road-port internal collaboration has become a trend. Whether it is between units, or between shifts, groups, types of work, or people, they help each other when they have difficulties and solve problems together. The scope of on-site collaboration of work groups has been expanded from collaboration between the same channel and neighboring warehouses to collaboration between separate channels, separate warehouses, and even between upper and lower shifts. According to statistics, from April to July, the 78 work groups in the wharf loading and unloading area collaborated with each other more than 8,400 times, and the 90 work groups in the storage yard loading and unloading area collaborated with each other more than 37,000 times.
	The in-depth development of internal large-scale collaboration has played a great role in consolidating and developing "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration. The main points are: 1. Effectively eliminating weak links in operations, so that each type of work and each work group can complete the operation plan in a balanced manner, improving loading and unloading efficiency and shortening the ship's time in port. According to statistics, from April to July, through the collaboration of groups, the storage yard loading and unloading area shortened the unloading time by more than 480 hours, and the wharf loading and unloading area also shortened the loading and unloading time by 402.6 hours. 2. Through collaboration, everyone takes helping others as an honor, so those who are helped strive to catch up with the advanced, achieving the purpose of mutual promotion and common improvement. 3. Through internal collaboration, the masses of employees have generally established an overall concept, and the barriers between people, groups, and shifts have been easily resolved, and the atmosphere of unity and friendship has greatly increased. Road-port internal collaboration not only guarantees the completion of the operation plan and the stable development of "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration, but also promotes the communist collaborative spirit of the masses of employees, laying a solid ideological foundation for "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration.
	In addition to carrying out road-port internal collaboration, they also put forward the fighting goals of "politics in command, thinking red, road-port employees twisted into a rope, throughput tasks surpass Tianjin Port, downtime breaks through six point zero, work hard and skillfully to create miracles, and join hands to enter Beijing," fully mobilizing the masses, and extensively and deeply carrying out the Red Flag competition movement of advanced ship trips and advanced trains. The employees have a high level of enthusiasm in the competition movement, which has played a great role in accelerating the turnover of trains and ships and cargo, and guaranteeing the continuous development of "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration.

    ——秦皇岛实行“一条龙”运输大协作的经验
    大协作　力量大
    秦皇岛港是我国沿海六大港之一，是国内处进出口物资的重要港口。由于我国工农业生产和国际贸易的日益发展，港口吞吐量和车站运货量连年增长，特别是从1958年大跃进以来，运量激增。1958年港口吞吐量比1957年增长了22％，1959年计划吞吐量又比1958年增长62％。铁路装卸车数1958年比1957年增长了6％，1959年又比1958年增长51％。随着港口吞吐量和车站装卸车数的迅速增长，出现了运力不足及港口通过能力不相适应的矛盾。这种矛盾，自从开展大协作以后，才迅速得到了解决。
    车站和港口，是车和船的连接点，是整个水陆运输的枢纽。车站所发货物中，90％以上要通过港口吞吐；港口吞吐的货物，几乎全部要通过车站转运。路港双方的关系唇齿相依，极为密切。但是，车船各有不同的要求，运行又很不平衡，因此路港之间长期存在着矛盾。港口由于统一负责车船的装卸作业，也就成了矛盾的集中点。经过整风运动，路港双方广大职工破除了本位主义，树立了“一盘棋”思想；接着，又学习了阜新、本溪等兄弟单位的协作经验，逐步实行了路港双方的“十二统一”，即：思想统一，计划统一，组织机构统一，班次统一，指标统一，措施统一，布置任务统一，作业过程统一，设备和劳动力使用统一，竞赛统一，汇报统一，总结统一，开始形成了新的协作关系。今年4月份，广大职工又根据水陆联运的特点，创造性地开展了“一条龙”的全面大协作。它的大体内容，是以换装港口和车站为枢纽，联结兄弟单位的红旗列车和定班定线的船舶，全面组织矿、路、港、船、货的大协作，形成水陆全程连续不断的运行组织，从而达到了加速车、船、货物周转的目的。
    通过大协作，扩大了港口和车站的通过能力，加速了车、船和货物的周转，得到了各方面的好评。今年上半年，在路港设备能力基本上没有增加的情况下，完成的吞吐量比去年同期增长了一点八倍；铁路装卸车辆比去年同期增长将近一倍；车船直接换装量占吞吐量的35％，比去年同期提高一点二倍；装卸单位成本比去年同期降低38％；车辆一次作业时间平均比去年同期缩短44％。第二季度以来，由于“一条龙”全面大协作逐渐发展，运输效率提高得更为显著。和第一季度比较，第二季度由于车点的缩短，共挖掘出六万五千个车小时，相当于秦皇岛到阜新间增加了一千八百多车皮的运力；船舶共缩短了六十五万多营运吨天，等于全季度增加了一艘七千二百吨的船舶。
    “三破”和“三立”
    “一条龙”全面大协作，是在党的领导下不断革命、不断发展、不断提高的产物；是广大职工思想认识不断提高的结果。搞好大协作，必须政治挂帅，首先提高思想认识。
    在1956年以前，路港双方主要是以合同的形式进行制约的。合同对生产虽然也起了一定的促进作用，但是由于路港双方都存在着本位主义，因而互不协调，给工作造成损失。
    伟大的整风运动，是路港协作的转折点。在市委书记亲自主持的路港领导干部协作会议上，他们本着从整体出发、为对方着想的精神，检查了思想，接着，又发动业务人员针对过去争论的焦点、扯皮的原因、造成的损失和今后怎么办等四个问题，展开了大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论。在双反运动中，他们又组织全体职工，开展了两个半月的反本位主义思想斗争。这一系列的集体主义教育，起到了三破三立的作用：破除了本位主义，树立了全局观点；破除了路、港互不信任、互不交底的思想，树立了团结协作、路港一家的思想；破除了残存的资本主义经营观点，树立了社会主义经营思想。从此以后，双方从上到下，主动接触，互相访问，互送保证条件，大兴协作之风。随着职工思想觉悟的提高，双方领导上经过研究，实行了“四统一”：统一班次、计划、指标、竞赛，使路港建立了新的协作关系。但是，由于双方调度指挥系统分立，技术作业过程复杂，还影响着调度指挥的统一和水陆运输枢纽作用的充分发挥，妨碍运输效率的迅速提高。今年年初，他们根据市委的指示，向全体职工进行了“全国一盘棋”的思想教育，并领导职工开展了“五满意”运动。“五满意”的中心是：努力改进自己的工作，把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人，达到矿、路、港（对方港）、船、货五方面的职工满意。通过教育，职工群众进一步明确了搞好协作的重要性。在这个思想基础上，他们扩大了协作内容，实行了路港协作“十统一”。由于双方职工觉悟不断提高，不满意组织机构分立的局面，双方党组织研究后，就统一了组织机构，统一和简化了技术作业过程，成为“十二统一”，使车船作业指挥形成了一个有机整体。从此，路港协作走向了更高的阶段；在思想上、组织上，路港真正成了一家。
    港站协作问题解决以后，车船运行组织不衔接的矛盾仍然存在，影响着换装作业的顺利进行。这证明，根据水陆联运的特点，单纯做好港站本身的协作是不够的，还必须把车船的运行组织紧密地衔接起来，并且尽可能地组织车船直接换装。这样，才能最大限度地加速车船货物的周转，大大提高港站通过能力，减少装卸操作系数，节约大量人力物力。因此，他们在上级的领导和支持下，主动和兄弟单位联系，把协作面向水陆两侧延伸发展。今年4月份，他们和北京铁路局协商，签订了阜新至秦皇岛间的直达列车协议。接着，又开办了古冶至秦皇岛间的红旗直达列车，和上海海运局、上海港联合签订了秦申线船舶定班定线协议。红旗列车保证了煤炭定时定量的到达，船舶定班定线保证了按时接运。这就使协作形式从“十二统一”提高为“一条龙”的大协作，从路港协作扩大为矿、路、港、船、货的全面大协作，使水陆运输全程形成了一个首尾相连的协作网。
    内部大协作实现“一条龙”
    路港内部协作，是“一条龙”大协作的基础；要想搞好“一条龙”全面大协作，必须搞好路港内部的大协作。因此，他们围绕缩短船期、车点和加速货物周转这一中心，抓紧进行“一盘棋”思想教育，树立协作的典范，并且把协作列为红旗竞赛的内容之一，使路港内部的协作迅速开展起来。现在，路港内部的协作已成了风气。无论各单位之间，或是班与班、组与组、工种与工种、人与人之间，都是有了困难互相帮助，发生问题共同解决。工组现场协作的范围，更由同道、邻仓之间的协作，扩大到隔道、隔仓工组以至上下班之间的协作。据统计，4至7月份，码头装卸区七十八个工组相互协作达八千四百多次，库场装卸区九十个工组相互协作达三万七千多次。
    内部大协作的深入开展，对巩固和发展“一条龙”大协作起了很大作用。主要的是：一、有效地消灭了作业中的薄弱环节，使各工种、各工组都能均衡地完成作业计划，提高了装卸效率，缩短了车船停港时间。据统计，4至7月份，通过组与组的协作，库场装卸区就提前卸车时间四百八十多小时，码头装卸区也提前装卸时间四百零二点六小时。二、通过协作，大家都以帮助别人为荣，因而被帮助的都努力争取赶上先进，达到了互相促进共同提高的目的。三、通过内部协作，职工群众普遍树立了整体观念，人与人、组与组、班与班之间的隔阂迎刃而解，团结友爱的空气大为高涨。路港内部协作，不仅保证了作业计划的完成，保证了“一条龙”大协作的稳固发展，而且发扬了职工群众的共产主义协作精神，为“一条龙”大协作奠定了牢固的思想基础。
    除了开展路港内部协作以外，他们还提出了“政治挂帅思想红，路港职工拧成绳，吞吐任务超津港，停时突破六点零，大干巧干创奇迹，共同携手进北京”的奋斗目标，充分发动群众，广泛深入地开展了先进船次和先进列车的红旗竞赛运动。职工们在竞赛运动中的干劲很高，对加速车船和货物周转，保证“一条龙”大协作的不断发展，起了很大作用。
