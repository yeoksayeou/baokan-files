    Hearing Qin Music on a Journey
    Zheng Boquan
    The inn under the old locust tree,
    Welcomes guests from north and south.
    The new moon over the small river,
    Stirs the traveler's homesickness.
    Looking back at the hazy distant mountains,
    And that most familiar star,
    At this moment, how I wish:
    To have a Qin by my side.
    Is it overthinking?
    I really hear melodious Qin music,
    Like a mountain stream in Lingnan,
    And like the call of the cuckoo.
    Only people from our Lingnan,
    Can play such Qin music,
    Could it be that in this distant land,
    There are also my fellow villagers?
    Suddenly the Qin music changes greatly,
    Surging like the waves of the East Sea,
    The sound of the waves just subsided,
    And then came the low吟 of the Wei River.
    Sometimes it's the Gobi Desert with flying sand and rocks,
    Sometimes it's the sunny and clear North China Plain;
    Sometimes it's the Kunlun Mountains rising abruptly,
    Sometimes it's the Fuchun River with willows and flowers.
    This is such wonderful Qin music,
    Surely it's not played by an ordinary artist.
    I go forward to visit, following the sound,
    With a feeling of admiration.
    In a small room,
    I found the person playing the Qin,
    He was changing a new string,
    And stood up with a smile when he saw me.
    He invited me to sit down,
    Apologizing for not being able to play the Qin well,
    Unexpectedly disturbing me,
    With his mixed accent that sounds awkward.
    He took down the iron hammer from the wall,
    Telling me he is just an ordinary worker,
    And said that he was not playing the Qin,
    But playing his own heart.
    He narrated his life story:
    "I am a descendant of the Oroqen,
    To support the repair of the Huai River,
    I came out of the Greater Khingan Mountains.
    "The year I left my hometown,
    I was as young as you,
    It was the season when the mountain pears were ripe,
    And relatives and friends in the tribe sent me off.
    "To boost my morale,
    The elders of the tribe played the Qin for me,
    Playing an ancient Oroqen tune,
    As deep as the Greater Khingan Mountains.
    "The elder handed the Qin to me,
    Without repeatedly urging me,
    He only said a simple sentence:
    This is a symbol of the Oroqen character.
    "From then on, I began my journey of thousands of miles,
    And also began to learn to play the Qin.
    From the Yumen Oilfield in the motherland,
    To the coast of the East Sea…
    "The rapids of the Three Gorges surge in my chest,
    White clouds float over the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau;
    I love the wind and snow of Erlang Mountain,
    And also love the sound of the wind in the bamboo forest of the South.
    Every mountain and river of the motherland,
    Are expanding my mind,
    I use an iron hammer to work for the motherland,
    And use Qin strings to play the love for life.
    Tomorrow, I and my partners,
    Will go to the Xin'an River again,
    Tonight I polished the iron hammer,
    And also changed a new string for the Qin."
    He stopped talking,
    Sat down and tried the new string,
    I seem to see a warrior,
    Gently tapping a sharp spear.
    I got his permission,
    And took the Qin from his hand,
    Am I afraid of making a fool of myself in front of others?
    Don't I know how to play my heart?
    This tune is not well played,
    It's just the first stage of life,
    But I still hope:
    The wind will transmit my Qin music.
    First, to report my safe journey,
    Second, to reassure my fellow villagers,
    No matter where I am,
    I am a Lingnan person!
    Thank you to the elders on the road of life,
    Who lit my heart,
    I got up and said goodbye to him,
    The east was already dawning.

### 旅夜闻琴

    旅夜闻琴
    郑伯权
    大槐树底下的旅店，
    接待南来北往的客人。
    小河上的新月，
    勾起了游子的乡情。
    回望身后朦胧的远山，
    和那颗最熟悉的星星，
    这时我多么希望：
    手边能有一张琴。
    是不是思想过敏？
    真的听到了悠扬的琴声，
    像岭南山中的流泉，
    又像杜鹃的啼鸣。
    只有我们岭南的人，
    才能弹出这样的琴声，
    莫非在遥遥的异乡，
    也会有我的乡亲？
    忽然琴音大变，
    澎湃如东海涛声，
    涛声刚刚沉落，
    又传来渭水的低吟。
    忽而是大戈壁飞沙走石，
    忽而是华北平原日丽风清；
    忽而是昆仑山横空出世，
    忽而是富春江柳暗花明。
    这是多么绝妙的琴声，
    弹奏定不是平常艺人。
    我寻声前去拜访，
    怀着钦佩的心情。
    在一个小屋里，
    找到了弹琴的人，
    他正在调换新弦，
    见了我笑着站起身。
    他招呼我坐下，
    抱歉自己不会弹琴，
    想不到会把我惊动，
    南腔北调怪不好听。
    他摘下壁间的铁锤，
    告诉我他只是个普通工人，
    又说他并不是在弹琴，
    而是在弹自己的心。
    他叙述了自己的身世：
    “我本是鄂伦春的子孙，
    为了支援修治淮河，
    才走出了兴安岭。
    “离开故乡的那一年，
    和你一样年青，
    正是山梨熟透的季节，
    族中的亲友送我远行。
    “为了壮我的行色，
    族中的长者为我抚琴，
    弹的是鄂伦春的古曲，
    像兴安岭一样幽深。
    “长者把琴交给我，
    对我并没有再三叮咛，
    只说了简单的一句：
    这就是鄂伦春性格的象征。
    “从此我开始万里跋涉，
    也开始学着弹琴。
    从祖国的玉门油矿，
    直到东海之滨……
    “胸中奔腾着三峡的急流，
    飘过云贵高原的白云；
    我爱二郎山的风雪，
    也爱南国竹林的风声。
    祖国的一山一水，
    都在扩大我的胸襟，
    我用铁锤为祖国工作，
    用琴弦弹出对生活的爱情。
    明天我和我的伙伴，
    又将走向新安江边，
    今夜我擦亮了铁锤，
    也给琴换上新弦。”
    他打住了话头，
    坐下来试了试新弦，
    我仿佛看到一个勇士，
    在轻敲着锋利的枪尖。
    我征得他的同意，
    接过他手上的琴，
    难道怕在人前出丑？
    难道我不会弹我的心？
    这一曲弹得不好，
    它只是生活的第一程，
    然而我还是希望：
    风儿为我传送琴声。
    一报旅途平安，
    二要乡亲们放心，
    不管在天南地北，
    我都是一个岭南人！
    感谢生活道路上的长者，
    点燃了我的心，
    起身和他握别，
    东方已经微明。
