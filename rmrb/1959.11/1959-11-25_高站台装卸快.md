    High Platforms for Fast Loading and Unloading
    (Reported by this newspaper) The automobile loading and unloading team of the Tieling County Transportation Bureau has built a "sky-bridge style tipper high platform" at the Bajiazi Limestone Plant. The high platform is five meters high, with rails on top for wheelbarrows to stop. Below it is connected to a funnel, under which automobiles can stop. From the limestone pile to the sky bridge, small tracks are laid, and ten wheelbarrows are used to transport limestone back and forth to the sky bridge. The automobiles stop under the sky bridge for loading, and the limestone slides into the truck box from the funnel. In the past, it took forty to fifty minutes to load a truck with a shovel, but now it only takes three to five minutes. Due to the reduced loading and unloading time, the vehicle transportation efficiency has been greatly improved. Each truck has increased from three round trips a day to four round trips. Every three trucks are equivalent to adding the carrying capacity of one truck.

    高站台装卸快
    本报讯　铁岭县运输局汽车装卸队在八家子石灰场建成一座“天桥式翻斗高站台”。高站台高五米，上有铁轨，可停轱辘马，下接漏斗，漏斗下面可停汽车。从石灰堆到天桥，铺有小轨道，用十台轱辘马来回装运石灰至天桥上，汽车停在天桥下面装车，石灰即从漏斗溜进车箱。过去用铁锹装石灰，装满一车要四、五十分钟，现在装满一车只用三、五分钟。由于装卸时间缩短了，车辆运输效率大为提高，每台车由过去一天跑三个往返，增加到跑四个往返，每三台汽车就等于增加了一台汽车的运力。
