Moscow dispatches from our correspondent

Our correspondent in Moscow

A representative from the Luoyang Bearing Factory

That was last spring. Inside the newly built, spacious workshop of the Luoyang Ball Bearing Factory, machines were being installed and tested with a constant rumble. Workers were working day and night, busy with the final touches. The Great Leap Forward was inspiring every worker, and everyone was working together to put the factory into production ahead of schedule. The construction site was changing daily, and the construction work was rapidly nearing completion, but the last batch of important machines ordered from the Soviet Union had yet to arrive. At this time, the usually cheerful laughter of the head of the Soviet expert team, Ikriannikov, disappeared. He was often pensive and worried, fearing that if this batch of machines did not arrive in time, it would affect the high-speed construction of the bearing factory.

A sense of responsibility for China's construction and the Chinese workers' enthusiasm for the Great Leap Forward motivated him, forcing him to make a decisive decision and come up with a solution: "That's right, we can't wait, I'll take a trip myself." Ikriannikov's enthusiastic and responsible spirit received the full support of the Luoyang factory. Thus, he went to the Soviet Union as a representative of the Luoyang factory to urge delivery.

Ikriannikov was originally the deputy chief engineer of the Moscow National First Bearing Factory. More than half of his life has been linked to bearing production, and he is an experienced expert. Since the factory assigned him to be responsible for the design of the Luoyang Bearing Factory and the supply of machinery and equipment in 1954, he has devoted himself wholeheartedly to China's construction.

As a representative of the Luoyang Bearing Factory, Ikriannikov traveled tirelessly to major cities in central and southern Soviet Union, visiting dozens of factories. Every time he arrived at a factory, he would say: "Our Luoyang factory is about to start production ahead of schedule, and we are waiting for your machinery and equipment!"

During the construction of the Luoyang factory, it was necessary to temporarily decide to expand the factory building and request the production of large bearings in 1959. But where could large machinery and equipment be purchased temporarily? Ikriannikov was in Moscow at this time. After learning of this decision, he immediately discussed it with the heads of three bearing factories and finally decided that in order to support their Chinese brothers, these three factories would take machines in use or awaiting use and send them to the Luoyang factory. The National First Bearing Factory alone shipped twenty-two such machines. With the enthusiastic help of Soviet friends, the Luoyang Bearing Factory went into production on time, powerfully supporting the national machinery industry production.

On the eve of the October Revolution Day, the reporter visited Ikriannikov. He was wearing a brown suit, and on the left lapel of his jacket was a glittering five-star red flag commemorative badge. In the center of his large desk was a horse sculpture given to him by the Luoyang factory, and next to it was a large group photo of him with his Chinese friends. He said: "Time flies so fast. It's been more than a year since I left China, and I miss Luoyang and China very much. In this year, your country has achieved so much! Now no one can deny that our two brotherly countries, united by eternal friendship, are moving shoulder to shoulder in the same direction from victory to victory."

As long as it is beneficial to China

Jiang Jifu and Li Songtao, Chinese interns in the Soviet Union, saw a complete set of Soviet and international data cards on degreased fiber research work when they were interning in the degreased fiber laboratory. This information was undoubtedly very useful. But there were so many cards that it would take two people ten days to copy them all, and they had internship tasks every day. They looked at them for a while and reluctantly walked away.

Unexpectedly, a Soviet laboratory technician saw this situation and immediately guessed what the Chinese comrades were thinking. He came over and asked the Chinese comrades. When he learned that the information was useful to the Chinese comrades but they did not have time to copy it, he immediately volunteered to copy it for the Chinese comrades. Jiang Jifu and Li Songtao declined his kind offer, because everyone in the lab was very busy, how could they simply add to the burden of the Soviet comrades. Later, Jiang Jifu and Li Songtao went on a business trip. More than a month later, when they returned to the laboratory, the laboratory director Petukhov gave them a brand new set of neatly copied data cards. It turned out that the fact that the Chinese comrades needed this set of cards quickly spread throughout the laboratory. During the period when Jiang Jifu and Li Songtao were on a business trip, from the director to every laboratory technician, everyone volunteered to use their rest time to copy all the cards accumulated over seven or eight years in more than a month. They said: "Giving up rest time is nothing, as long as it is beneficial to China..."

They work hard to learn Chinese from an early age

Moscow No. 11 Boarding School is an eleven-year school specializing in training Chinese translators. The children here start learning Chinese from the second grade of elementary school. No. 11 Boarding School is located in a beautiful and quiet suburb. Hundreds of children study, work, and grow here.

This school was an ordinary middle school before 1956. In 1956, it was changed to a boarding school, and the following year it was changed to a school specializing in learning Chinese. The school has three hundred and seventy students. Except for the first grade, the second to eleventh grades have four to five hours of Chinese class every week. The principal told us: "The children are clearly aware of the meaning and purpose of learning Chinese, so they work very hard. Although there are many difficulties, their desire and enthusiasm to learn Chinese well overcome the difficulties."

In the past two years, the children have mastered hundreds of Chinese characters. Students generally learn Pinyin first, learn to read, and then recognize and write Chinese characters.

In order to cultivate students' habit of speaking Chinese, the school often holds various evenings in Chinese. At the evening, students dance Chinese dances, sing Chinese songs, perform Chinese dramas, recite Chinese poems, and so on. These activities can enable children to consolidate the Chinese they have learned and become familiar with the situation in China.

The principal and the director of the Chinese teaching and research section accompanied us to the eighth-grade classroom where classes were in progress. As soon as we stepped into the door, the students greeted us in fluent Mandarin.

Although this class is in the eighth grade, they have only been learning Chinese for two years. Judging from what the teachers asked and the students answered, their academic performance is not small. The teacher asked in Russian and asked the students to translate it into Chinese on the blackboard. The teacher asked in Russian: "How many trees have you planted?" A girl named Natasha went to the blackboard to write. Although she wrote slowly and the square characters were a bit crooked, she wrote them correctly. The teacher asked all the students in Chinese: "Why do you want to learn Chinese?" A male student named Toliang replied in Chinese: "We love China and the Chinese people."

There are a total of seven Chinese teachers in this school. Some of them are graduates of the Department of Oriental Languages, and some have been to China.

We saw a colored hanging picture in the corridor of a classroom. The names of Chinese places were densely written on it. The graphic of Tiananmen Square was in the center, with small red flags inserted in it, and there were also small red flags in Guangdong and Shanghai. The principal explained that this is a chart made by students themselves for communicating with various places in China. The ones marked with red flags are those that have already established contact. They hope that in the near future, these red flag markers will be inserted all over the place.

The mind of a deaf-mute person

Yang Chaojin, a radio professional intern, has been interning in the Soviet Union for less than a year, but he has initially mastered the theory and technology of microwave antenna design and production, which is the most complex in radio communication. When talking about the internship process, Yang Chaojin always remembers such a touching thing.

This summer, after Yang Chaojin finished studying the theoretical part of microwave antennas at the All-Soviet Radio Research Institute, he went to the factory to directly master the production technology of microwave antennas. Yang Chaojin interned in one workshop after another in turn. One day, in the waveguide workshop, when the workers were explaining a complex process of waveguide production to him, he still couldn't understand it even though the Soviet comrades drew many diagrams. So many workers in the workshop gathered around to offer suggestions. At this time, Yang Chaojin found that one of the workers was a deaf-mute person. But his enthusiasm for solving difficulties for Yang Chaojin was no less than that of other workers. It turned out that this deaf-mute worker was one of the most skilled in the waveguide workshop. When he learned that the Chinese intern was in trouble, he immediately ran over and gestured to everyone that real objects must be used for demonstration. This deaf-mute person voluntarily began to help Yang Chaojin by using various methods such as gestures, writing, and operational demonstrations. Although the weather was very hot and he had a lot of work to do himself, he still wiped the sweat from his forehead and tried everything he could. In the absence of language, an important tool for exchanging ideas, Yang Chaojin thoroughly mastered important and complex processes in waveguide production such as making filter wave dividers. Sometimes it was really impossible to explain, and there was no real object of the kind needed in the workshop, so he negotiated with the leadership, opened the warehouse and took Yang Chaojin to the warehouse to see. When he knew that Yang Chaojin really understood his meaning and mastered the technology he taught, he raised his thumb and expressed his sincere happiness.

    本报驻莫斯科记者
    洛阳轴承厂的代表
    那是去年春天，洛阳滚珠轴承厂新建的宽敞车间里正在紧张地安装机器，试车声不时地隆隆轰鸣，工人昼夜不息，忙着装修。大跃进鼓舞着每一个工人，大家齐心协力要让工厂提早投入生产。工地的面貌一天变一个样，建筑工程飞快地进入尾声，但是在苏联预订的最后一批重要机器，启运日期杳无音信。这时苏联专家组长伊柯里安尼斯托夫素有的开朗的笑声消失了，他经常沉思、不安，担心这批机器如果及时运不到，就会影响轴承厂的高速度建设。
    对中国建设事业的责任感和中国工人大跃进的热情激励着他，使他不能不当机立断，想出办法：“对，不能等，我亲自跑一趟。”伊柯里安尼斯托夫热情负责的精神得到了洛阳厂的全力支持。这样，他就作为洛阳厂的代表出差到苏联催货去了。
    伊柯里安尼斯托夫原是莫斯科国家第一轴承工厂的副总工程师，一生中二分之一以上的时间是同轴承生产连在一起的，是个经验丰富的专家。从1954年工厂委派他负责设计洛阳轴承厂并供应机器设备的工作后，他就全心全意投入了中国的建设之中了。
    伊柯里安尼斯托夫以洛阳轴承厂代表的身份不辞劳苦地跑遍了苏联中部南部各大城市，拜访了数十个工厂。每到一厂，他总是说：“我们洛阳厂要提前开工，就等待着你们的机器设备啦！”
    洛阳厂在建设中途，由于需要临时决定扩建厂房，并要求在1959年生产大型轴承。但是到哪里临时购置大型机器设备呢？伊柯里安尼斯托夫这时正在莫斯科，他在得悉这个决定后立即同三个轴承工厂负责人一起研究，最后决定为了支援中国兄弟，从这三个工厂现用的或待用的这种机床中抽出来分运洛阳厂。仅国家第一轴承厂运出的这种机器就达二十二部。洛阳轴承厂在苏联朋友的热情帮助下按时投入了生产，有力地支援了全国机器工业生产。
    十月革命节前夕，记者访问了伊柯里安尼斯托夫。他穿着一身褐色西服，上装左襟上别着一枚闪闪发光的五星红旗纪念章。他的大办公桌正中放着洛阳厂赠送给他的一匹骏马雕刻，一边摆着他同中国朋友们的合影大照片。他说：“时间过得飞快，离开中国已经一年多了，我一直非常想念洛阳，想念中国。这一年，你们国家又获得了多大的成就啊！现在谁也不能否认，由永恒的友谊结合起来的我们两国兄弟，正并肩地朝着同一方向从胜利走向胜利。”
    只要对中国有利
    我国留苏实习生江吉甫和李松涛在脱脂纤维实验室实习时，看到一套十分完备的苏联和各国有关脱脂纤维研究工作的资料卡片，无疑这种资料是很需要的。可是卡片那么多，两个人整整抄上十天也抄不完呀，何况每天都有实习任务。他们两个人翻看了一会就依依不舍地走开了。
    不料这个情况被实验室里的一位苏联实验员看见，他立即猜透了中国同志的心思，走过来问中国同志。当他知道这资料对中国同志有用而他们自己又没有时间抄写的时候，立刻表示自愿替中国同志抄写。江吉甫和李松涛谢绝了他这样的好意，因为室里每个同志工作都很忙，怎能随便加重苏联同志的负担呢。以后，江吉甫和李松涛就出差去了，一个多月后他们回到实验室，实验室主任彼图霍夫把一套崭新的抄写得很恭正的资料卡片送给了他们二人。原来中国同志需要这套卡片的事很快地传遍了实验室，趁江吉甫和李松涛出差的时期，从主任到每个实验员，全体自愿利用休息时间，在一个多月的时间内，把积累了七八年的卡片，全部赶抄了出来。他们说：“放弃休息时间没有什么，只要对中国有利……。”
    他们从小努力学中文
    莫斯科第十一寄宿学校是一所专门培养中文翻译人材的十一年制学校。这里的孩子从小学二年级起就开始学习中文。第十一寄宿学校座落在风景幽美、环境安静的郊区。几百个孩子在这里学习、劳动、成长。
    这个学校在1956年以前是一所普通中学，1956年起改为寄宿学校，第二年又改为专门学习中文的学校。学校有三百七十个学生。除一年级外，二至十一年级每周都有四至五小时的中文课。校长告诉我们说：“孩子们都清楚地知道学习中文的意义和目的，所以他们都很用功。困难虽多，但是，他们要学好中文的心愿和热情战胜了困难。”
    两年来孩子们已经掌握了几百个中文字。学生一般是先学拼音，学会读，然后再认汉字和书写。
    为了养成学生说中文的习惯，学校时常用中文举办各种晚会。在晚会上让学生跳中国舞、唱中国歌、演中国剧、朗诵中国的诗等等。这些活动能使孩子们巩固所学过的中文，熟悉中国的情况。
    校长和中文教研室主任陪同我们来到正在上课的八年级教室，我们刚踏进门口，学生们就用流利的北京话向我们问好。
    这个班虽是八年级，但学中文的历史只有两年，从教员所问和学生所答看来，他们的学习成绩是不小的。教员用俄文问，要学生在黑板上翻译成汉语。教员用俄文问：“你们种了多少棵树？”一个叫娜塔莎的女孩到黑板上去写。她写得虽慢，方块字写得有些歪斜，但是写对了。教员用中文向全体学生问：“你们为什么要学中文”？一个叫托梁的男学生用中文回答说：“我们热爱中国和中国人民”。
    这个学校共有七个中文教员。他们有的是东方语言系毕业的学生，有的曾经到过中国。
    我们在一间教室的走廊上看到一张彩色挂图。上面密密麻麻地写着中文地名。天安门的图形在正中，插上了小红旗，广东、上海也有小红旗。校长解释说，这是学生自制的与中国各地通信的图示，标上红旗的是已经有通讯联系的，他们希望在不久的将来这些红旗标志将插遍每一个地方。
    哑人的心意
    无线电专业实习生杨朝津到苏联实习还不满一年，但已初步掌握了无线电通讯中最复杂的微波天线设计制作的理论和技术。谈起实习过程的时候杨朝津总忘不了这样一件感人的事。
    今年夏天，杨朝津在全苏无线电研究所学习完关于微波天线的理论部分后，下厂去直接掌握微波天线生产技术。杨朝津一个车间接着一个车间的依次实习。一天在波导车间，工人为他讲解复杂的波导制作的一个工序时，苏联同志虽然画了许多图，他还是领会不了。于是车间的许多工人都围拢来献计了。这时杨朝津发现工人中有一位是哑人。但他要为杨朝津解决困难热情丝毫不亚于其他工人。原来这位聋哑工人是波导车间中技术最好的一个。当他知道中国实习生发生困难时，就立即跑过来向大家作手势，表示必须拿出实物来示范才行。这位哑人运用手势、写字和操作表演等各种办法开始自愿帮助杨朝津。虽然天气很热，他自己工作也很多，但他还是抹掉额上的汗珠，想一切办法，在没有语言这样一个重要的交流思想的工具情况下，使得杨朝津彻底掌握波导生产中像制滤波器电波分波等重要复杂的工序。有时实在讲不通，又碰上车间中没有正需要的那种实物时，他就向领导上交涉，打开仓库带杨朝津到仓库里去看，当他知道杨朝津真的已领会他的意思和掌握了他所教给的技术的时候，他就竖起大姆指，表示由衷的高兴。
