    Banks Established on Construction Sites
    Facilitating Deposits and Withdrawals
    The Xiangyang County Bank of Hubei Province and various credit cooperatives are actively organizing "construction site banks" to raise funds and serve water conservancy construction.
    The county has extracted 25 bank and credit cooperative cadres, establishing "construction site banks" at 18 larger water conservancy construction sites to facilitate deposits and withdrawals for migrant workers. The Oumiao Bank branch also combined with the construction site cultural troupe to conduct propaganda activities using clapper talks and singing, receiving 3,700 yuan in deposits in two days. According to the statistics of thirteen "construction site banks" over seven days, a total of more than 27,600 yuan in deposits were received.
