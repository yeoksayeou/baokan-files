Mountain Eagle, Ox, Pine and Bamboo
　　Shi Shouzhi

　　At the meeting of heroes, the heroes, with soaring spirits, reported to the Party, to the people, and to their comrades on all fronts, excitedly reviewing the achievements of the Great Leap Forward, and looking forward to the coming year with boundless confidence. This scene reminded me of the mountain eagle, the ox, and the pine and bamboo.

　　"The eagle soars in the sky," flying high and seeing far, with majestic momentum and fearlessness. This is precisely the revolutionary spirit of the working class. The working class has great ambitions, a frank and selfless mind, shoulders the historical mission of liberating all mankind, dares to think and act, dares to make a thorough break with the traditional old system and old ideas, charges forward for the truth, and advances courageously. The working class can have such a magnificent spirit because it is based on the dialectical materialist world view, recognizes and grasps the objective laws of the development of things, and obtains the "kingdom of freedom," so it dares to move mountains and seas and change the face of nature; it dares to attack the dark social system and destroy the chains of thousands of years of exploitation and oppression.

　　The source of this spirit of the working class is the power of the collective. Only the power of the collective, the power of the masses, is infinite and the greatest. Relying on the masses, "there is no unknowable principle, and there is nothing that cannot be done." When we do work and handle affairs, if we don't do it, then we don't do it. If we do it, we must make a name for ourselves. Despise all difficulties, overcome all difficulties, grow and strengthen in the struggle against all kinds of difficulties, and move from one victory to another, vigorous and "riding the long wind and breaking thousands of miles of waves," this is the spirit of the working class, this is the courage of the working class.

　　With a great spirit, one must also have perseverance and the pragmatic spirit of unremitting efforts. Speaking of perseverance, one is reminded of the farm cattle. The ox never shirks or slacks off, always works hard, is diligent and hard-working, and strives for production, serves the people, day after day, until its strength is exhausted. Lu Xun's famous line "willing to be an ox for the children" has educated and inspired so many people!

　　The working class is the most persevering. For the liberation of the working people and for the revolutionary cause, it does not hesitate to shed blood and sacrifice, advancing wave upon wave. It has never been pessimistic or disappointed because of temporary failures; it has never slackened or weakened because of setbacks; it has never coveted personal comfort and worked intermittently. Setbacks and failures are nothing. The development of things is originally tortuous; the growth of new forces is inevitably hindered by decadent forces.

　　The perseverance of the working class is given by the lofty ideal of communism and the belief in inevitable victory. The Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results has given people strength and perseverance. With perseverance, the drive can be sustained, and it is always full, and the energy is always present, rather than rising and falling with the beat of a drum. Give full play to subjective initiative, offer ideas, think of ways, tap potential, find tricks, do everything possible to overcome all difficulties that can be overcome, and complete all achievable targets; this is the spirit of the Foolish Old Man who moved mountains taught by Chairman Mao.

　　With perseverance, there will also be a spirit of tenacity. The tenacious spirit of the working class can be portrayed by bamboo and pine trees.

　　Both bamboo and pine trees have a tenacious spirit. Pine seedlings grow strongly from the cracks in the rocks; bamboo shoots break through the solid strata. They are fearless of frost and snow, and unafraid of wind and rain. In the cold of winter, one knows its resistance to weathering; after winter, one sees the green forest.

　　What we need is precisely this spirit. Thanks to the guidance of the Party and the encouragement of the meeting of heroes, it will take root, sprout, blossom, and bear fruit in the hearts of more and more people.

    山鹰·牛·松竹
  　时寿之
    群英会上，英雄们意气如虹，向党、向人民、向各个战线的战友们汇报，满怀兴奋地回顾大跃进的成果，无限自信地展望来年。这情景，使我想起山鹰，想起了牛，想起了松竹。
    “鹰击长空”，高飞远瞩，气势雄伟，无所畏惧。这正是工人阶级的革命气魄。工人阶级抱负远大，胸襟坦白无私，肩担解放全人类的历史使命，敢想敢为，敢于同传统的旧制度旧观念作彻底的决裂，为真理冲锋陷阵，勇往直前。工人阶级能够有如此雄伟的气魄，是基于辩证唯物主义的世界观，认识和掌握了事物发展的客观规律性，获得“自由的王国”，所以敢于移山倒海，改变自然面貌；敢于冲击社会黑暗制度，摧毁几千年剥削压迫的锁链。
    工人阶级这种气魄的泉源是集体的力量，只有集体的力量、群众的力量才是无穷无尽和最伟大的。依靠了群众，“没有不可知之理，没有无办法的事”。我们做工作，办事情，不干则已，要干，就一定要干出一个名堂来。藐视一切困难，战胜一切困难，从和各种各样的困难斗争中成长壮大，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利，生龙活虎，“乘长风破万里浪”，这就是工人阶级的气概，这就是工人阶级的魄力。
    有了伟大的气魄，还得有毅力和坚韧不拔的求实精神。谈到毅力，使人联想到耕牛。牛，从不偷闲躲懒，总是那样勤劳耐苦脚踏实地地发奋努力，为生产服务，为人民服务，一日复一日，直到力尽时。鲁迅的“俯首甘为孺子牛”的名句，曾经教育和激励了多少人啊！
    工人阶级就是最有毅力的，为了劳苦大众的解放，为了革命事业，不惜流血牺牲，前仆后继。它从来没有因为暂时失败而悲观失望；从没有因为遭受挫折而松劲泄气；从来没有贪图个人安逸而时作时辍。挫折，失败，算不了什么，事物的发展本来就是迂回曲折的；新生力量的成长难免受到腐朽力量的阻拦。
    工人阶级的毅力，是共产主义的崇高理想和必胜信念所赋予的。党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，给了人们力量，给了人们毅力。有了毅力，干劲就可以持久，而且什么时候也是十足的，气经常在鼓着，而不是随鼓随泄。发挥主观能动作用，出主意，想办法，挖潜力，找窍门，千方百计，克服一切可以克服的困难，完成一切能够达到的指标；这就是毛主席所教导我们的愚公移山的精神。
    有了毅力，也就会有坚韧不拔的精神。工人阶级的坚韧精神，竹子和松树可以作为写照。
    竹子和松树，都具有坚韧的精神。松苗从石缝中茁强地生长出来；竹笋把坚固的地层冲破。它们无畏冰霜，不惮风雨。岁寒，益知耐雕；经冬，才见绿林。
    我们需要的正是这种精神。由于党的指引，由于群英会的鼓舞，它将会在更多更多的人的心里生根发芽，开花结果。
