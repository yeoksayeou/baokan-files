    Yunfeng Hydroelectric Station
    In September of last year, when the government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea paid a friendly visit to our country, it held talks with our government on issues of economic cooperation between the two countries. The two governments decided to jointly invest in the construction of the Yunfeng Hydroelectric Station to meet the needs of the two countries' construction.
    This hydroelectric station is being built on the Yalu River in the Shangtao area of Ji'an County, Jilin Province, China. On the other side of the river is Yunfeng-ri in Korea. Here, the Yalu River flows through steep mountains, forming a large "Z" shape. The Korean side is responsible for building a dam at the last stroke of this "Z" to form a large artificial lake upstream of the Yalu River, creating a drop of more than 100 meters near the power plant, so that the average flow of 1,000 cubic meters per second of the Yalu River drives the four generators, each with a capacity of 100,000 kilowatts, built by the Chinese side through a water tunnel dug on the north bank of the Yalu River, and then flows back into the river.
    When the Korean Cabinet approved the decision to build this power station in early October last year, it pointed out that the joint construction of the Yunfeng Power Plant by Korea and China is of great significance for meeting the electricity needs of the leap forward in the socialist construction of Korea and China and strengthening the power base. The decision also said that this will play a significant role in further strengthening the friendly and cooperative relations between the people of the two countries.
    This power project, jointly built by China and Korea, is a symbol of mutual support between the people of the two countries. Its power grid will be distributed across the lands of both countries, and the electricity generated will further enhance the strength of the two countries' construction undertakings. At the same time, this construction project will also demonstrate to the world the power of the solidarity of the socialist camp. (Zhou)

    云峰水电站
    去年9月间，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团在我国进行友好访问时，曾和我国政府就两国经济合作问题举行会谈。两国政府决定共同投资兴建云峰水电站，以满足两国建设的需要。
    这个水电站建设在我国吉林省辑安县上套地区的鸭绿江上，江那边就是朝鲜的云峰里。鸭绿江在这里穿流过陡峭的高山，形成一个大“之”字形。朝鲜方面负责在这个“之”字的最后一捺的地方修建一座拦河大坝，以便在鸭绿江上游形成一个大人工湖，在发电厂附近造成一百多米高的落差，使鸭绿江平均每秒一千立方米的流水，通过在鸭绿江北岸开凿的水洞，带动中国方面负责建设的四台容量各十万瓩的发电机，然后再流入江中。
    朝鲜内阁在去年10月初批准建设这个发电站的决定时指出，朝中两国共同进行云峰发电厂的建设，对满足跃进中的朝中两国社会主义建设的电力需要和加强动力基地具有重大意义。决定还说，这对进一步加强两国人民间的友好合作关系有重大作用。
    中朝两国共同修建的这个发电工程，是两国人民互相支援的象征，它的电网将分布到两国的土地上，发出的电力将进一步增强两国建设事业的力量；同时，这个建设工程也将向全世界显示社会主义阵营团结的威力。（周）
