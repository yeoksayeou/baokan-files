    A Million-Strong Army Transporting Urban and Rural Goods by Land and Water
    Sichuan's Freight Volume Doubles in a Month
    Short-Distance Transportation: Unlimited Potential

    (Our Chengdu Dispatch, November 4th) Reporter Li Shaoyi reports: Sichuan province's million-strong army of short-distance land and water transportation workers more than doubled its freight volume in the first month of the decisive battle for the fourth quarter, compared to September. They have excellently completed the transportation tasks.

    Sichuan province's fourth-quarter materials not only involve a large freight volume and a wide range but also require urgency. In particular, the freight volume of short-distance distribution materials has increased sharply, reaching more than 20 million tons for the entire quarter, of which more than 5.7 million tons of pig iron, grain, foreign trade materials, etc., are transferred from various special districts, an increase of about half compared to the third quarter.

    In order to improve winter transportation, transportation headquarters or mass short-distance transportation offices have been successively established and improved at all levels from the province to the townships, implementing graded leadership, unified management, layer-by-layer contracts, three grasps a day, one check every five days, and a summary every ten days. Many local grain, commerce and trade departments have also implemented joint offices, arranging freight volume on a monthly and ten-day basis, unifying the dispatch of vehicles and ships, and carrying out large-scale internal and external cooperation between regions and departments. At the same time, according to the amount of collection and transportation tasks in their respective regions, all localities take into consideration the needs of industry, agriculture, commerce, etc., seizing the opportunity, making the most of the time, arranging transportation labor, using all available labor, and rushing to transport materials day and night. Thanks to the mass transportation movement, the shortage of existing short-distance transportation capacity has been made up, so that long-distance trunk line transportation and short-distance transportation are closely linked and coordinated, forming a comprehensive transportation network extending in all directions from cities to rural areas, from land and water to the air, throughout the province.

    Vigorously carrying out technological revolution, arming the mass transportation team, improving transportation efficiency, and saving labor are the distinct characteristics of the upsurge in short-distance transportation in Sichuan province. The province's water and land transportation departments are vigorously promoting the motorization, animalization, and ship transportation of transportation. At present, 1,058 factories and mines in the province have fully realized one-network and five-ization transportation. There are more than 40,000 kilometers of simple factory and mine roads, large vehicle roads, various tracks, cable car roads, waterways, etc., which can save more than 260,000 transportation laborers according to preliminary calculations. Communes, commerce and trade, transportation, and industrial and mining enterprises in Dazhou Special District rely on their own efforts, find raw materials, provide their own labor, and carry out large-scale cooperation, setting off a mass car and boat building movement. Since August, they have built more than 1,900 tons of wooden boats and more than 2,000 various earthen vehicles, arming tens of thousands of transportation laborers and increasing transportation efficiency by one to several times.

    Fully using existing private transportation tools, organically combining professional transportation with sideline transportation, and modern transportation tools with private transportation tools are important measures for Sichuan province to tap transportation potential. In October, the province adopted the method of drawing and repairing, transferring nearly 200,000 animal-drawn carts, flatbed carts, frame carts, and various earthen carts from the agricultural and sideline fronts, and more than 5,000 tons of wooden boats to support short-distance transportation, collecting and transporting more than 2 million tons of short-distance materials. Xichong County organized all the flatbed carts, manual frame carts, and wheelbarrows in the county, launching a five-day blitz, and transported more than 70,000 kilograms of grain.

    In the mass transportation movement in various parts of Sichuan, the policy of combining political and ideological education with material rewards has been correctly implemented, continuously pushing the movement to new climaxes.

    While organizing mass short-distance transportation, all localities have also made proper arrangements for the food, accommodation, tea, and medical treatment of the transportation army. Xichong County set up a tea station every five *li* along the collection and transportation line and arranged food and accommodation in restaurants. Nanbu County organized more than 160 medical personnel, carrying health kits on their backs, to provide care along the way with the collection and transportation army. In addition, the county also set up 79 fixed medical stations, 67 tea stations, and 32 dining stations, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses for transportation.

    百万大军水陆兼程赶运城乡物资
    四川一月之间运量猛增一倍
    短途运输　潜力无穷
    本报成都4日电　记者李绍伊报道：四川省百万水陆短途运输大军，在决战第四季度的头一个月中，比9月份运量猛增一倍以上。出色地完成了运输任务。
    四川省第四季度物资不仅运量大，范围广，而且要求急。特别是短途集散物资运量骤增，全季达二千多万吨，其中从各专区调出的生铁、粮食、外贸物资等有五百七十多万吨，比第三季度增长了一半左右。
    为了搞好冬季运输，从省到乡各级组织都相继建立和健全了运输指挥部或群众短途运输办公室，实行分级领导，统一管理，层层包干，一日三抓，五日一查，十日一小结的办法。许多地方的粮食、商贸等部门还实行联合办公，按月按旬安排运量，统一调度车船，开展地区和部门之间的内外大协作。与此同时，各地根据本地区集运任务的多少，全面兼顾工农商等各方面的需要，抓紧时机，见缝插针，安排运输劳力，利用一切可以利用的劳动力，日夜兼程赶运物资。由于群众性的运输运动，弥补了现有短途运力的不足，从而使长途干线运输和短途运输密切衔接配合，从城市到农村，从陆地、水上到空中，在全省范围内形成了一个四通八达的交通网。
    大闹技术革命，武装群众运输队伍，提高运效，节约劳力，是四川省短途运输高潮中的鲜明特点。全省水陆交通部门都正在大力推广车子化、畜力化和船运化的运输。目前全省已有一千零五十八个厂矿全部实现了一网五化运输，共有厂矿简易公路，大车道，各种轨道，缆车道，航道等四万多公里，初步计算可节约运输劳动力二十六万多人。达县专区各公社，商贸，交通和厂矿企业自力更生，自找原料，自备劳力，大搞协作配合，掀起了一个群众性的造车造船运动。从8月份到现在已造木船一千九百多吨，各种土车二千多辆，武装了上万个运输劳动力，使运效提高了一倍到数倍。
    充分使用现有民间运输工具，使专业运输和副业运输，现代化运输工具和民间运输工具有机地相结合，是四川省挖掘运输潜力的重要措施。全省在10月份采取抽用和修理的办法，从农副业战线上调出了兽力车、板车、架车，以及各种土车将近二十万辆，木船五千多吨，支援短途运输，共集运短途物资二百多万吨。西充县组织全县的板车，人力架车，鸡公车，突击五天，就调运出了七万余斤粮食。
    四川各地在大搞群众运输运动中，都正确贯彻了政治思想教育和物资奖励相结合的政策，不断地把运动推向新的高潮。
    在组织群众性短途运输的同时，各地对运输大军的食、宿、茶水、医疗等问题也都作了妥善安排。西充县在集运沿线每隔五华里设一个茶水站，在饭店安排食宿。南部县组织一百六十多个医务人员，身背保健箱，跟随集运大军沿途进行护理，此外该县还设立了固定医疗站七十九个，茶水站六十七个，饭站三十二个，对群众的运输积极性鼓舞很大。（苗地插画）
