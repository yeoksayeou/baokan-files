Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line and inspired by the Great Leap Forward, the Nantong City Branch of the People's Bank of China has, in the past nine months, while comprehensively leaping forward in all aspects of its work, completed 397 innovation projects (items). The key innovations include the creation of electric, hand-cranked, and foot-pedaled currency counting machines; coin counting and packaging devices; electric coin exchange machines; automatic paging devices; electric conveyors; voucher binding machines; accounting, teller, and savings workstations; and various forms of interest calculators. They also successfully modified electric, hand-cranked, and foot-pedaled accounting machines and electric typewriters, gradually equipping the city's banking institutions. Now, accounting can be done without pens, calculation without abacuses, counting without hands, and transmission without people. After the publication of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the employees were greatly encouraged. In September, to celebrate the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, they created the "Electric Currency Counting and Bundling Combined Machine." This machine has three major components and fifteen processes, including currency counting, sorting, paper cutting, bundling, pasting, and drying, all automatically controlled and linked. Moreover, it does not bundle amounts less than one hundred bills and automatically rejects those exceeding one hundred. The success of this creation laid the foundation for the technological innovation of the banking industry to leap to a new stage.

Now, in the business hall of the Nantong City Branch of the People's Bank of China, there are specially made workstations with extended tabletops replacing the old counters. Accountants press the buttons on the machines to calculate the figures on the vouchers. Tellers easily count stacks of banknotes fed into the currency counting machines. On the accounting workstations are various electric, hand-cranked, and foot-pedaled accounting machines. Accountants hold the vouchers and press the buttons, and the debits, credits, and balances on the ledgers are continuously displayed on the machine. It can record eight hundred entries per hour, with complete accuracy and clarity. Voucher transmission is already using the "Electric Transmission Machine." In addition, there are report printing machines, rapid card index boxes, electric government bond winning number verification devices, and so on. All major operating procedures have been semi-mechanized and tooled.

The "Mu Guiying" Savings Office of the Nantong People's Bank of China Branch is a unit that has done a relatively good job in carrying out technological innovation. The two specially made savings workstations with curved counters in this office are clean and tidy, with no ink, inkpads, or other office supplies visible. These supplies are cleverly and rationally arranged in fixed positions inside the workstations. When tellers need to retrieve various important documents and cash, they simply push the movable glass tabletop on the slide, and the electric stamping machine, electric coin exchange machine, electric change dispenser, interest calculator, prize-winning certificate placement device, and so on appear in the curved counter in front of the workstation. For stamping, there is an electric stamping machine that automatically stamps all kinds of seals at once. For exchanging coins, the required coins automatically pop out of the counter with the press of a button. Calculating interest can also be done without an abacus. By looking at the "Deposit Period Calculation Ruler," pulling the "Interest Calculation Device" belt, and pressing the machine button, the interest due is immediately and accurately calculated. A disc-shaped movable ledger box in the middle of the workstation can rotate forward, backward, left, and right. It contains thousands of ledger pages, and whichever one is needed can be easily obtained with a slight turn. In short, everything here is designed and made according to the actual needs of work and business. Even a spittoon is equipped with a foot-operated automatic opening and closing lid to avoid having to lift the lid by hand.

Not only that, but in the past eight months, the Nantong City Branch of the People's Bank of China has also actively collaborated with 108 other banks and offices outside the province. In addition to supplying 252 drawings and materials such as currency counting machines to various banks, it has also transferred nearly twenty accounting machines and currency counting machines to banks in Lanzhou, Yumen, and other locations. At the same time, it manufactured 8,000 sets of coin counters and 200 sets of coin packaging devices to supply the needs of fraternal banks inside and outside the province.

People may ask: "This bank must have a team of people, a set of equipment, and certain technical conditions to come up with these innovations?" In fact, it is not so. The truth is that there was no technical team, no decent equipment, and no technical foundation. The people were originally accountants, general affairs clerks, currency counters, and guards. The tools started with a few small hammers and small files, and now there are only some self-made "native lathes," "native planers," "native drilling machines," and so on. The main thing is that under the leadership of the Party, all employees of the bank have made the following efforts:

First, strengthen the leadership of the Party and adhere to putting politics in command.

The Nantong People's Bank of China Branch established a special Scientific and Technological Innovation Group for financial work, with the secretary personally taking charge, strengthening the specific leadership of this work, especially the leadership of political and ideological work. For example, when the action slogan of "Fighting hard for one year to basically realize the semi-mechanization and tooling of accounting and teller work" was first put forward at the beginning of technological innovation, most comrades actively supported it, but a few comrades had a sense of resistance. They said: "The bank is not like a factory, how can it achieve mechanization?" "Nantong is a small place with few bank cadres and a low technical level. It is a dream to basically achieve mechanization within one year." ... In response to these ideas, in addition to strengthening the positive education on the great significance of technological innovation in various ways, we focused on adopting the method of organizing forces, breaking through a point, and making a model to educate the masses with facts. The success of Comrade Chen Changquan and others in creating the "coin counter" and the birth of the first electric currency counting machine powerfully shattered the mysterious view of mechanization and greatly improved the confidence and determination of employees. Many employees said with emotion: There is nothing difficult in the world for those who set their minds to it. I never thought that the hands that used to calculate with abacuses, count banknotes, and move pens could now manufacture such sophisticated machines!

However, technological innovation is not something that can be achieved with a wave of the hand or a stomp of the foot, and ideological liberation is not something that can be thoroughly achieved in a day or two. For example, when the quality of some innovative products was not ideal enough, the people who mastered the machines were not skilled enough, and some problems occurred during the trial use, a few "head-shaking factions" said that the successful creations were "bragging" and that the innovations were "useless old machines." After this situation occurred, the Party organization immediately launched a struggle to encourage hard work and oppose right-leaning. Later, after the fact that the coin counters created by Comrade Chen Changquan and others were sold to more than 650 cities and counties and improved efficiency by more than ten times gave a devastating blow to right-leaning conservative ideas, technological innovation developed smoothly in the direction pointed out by the Party.

Second, resolutely implement the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and "walking on two legs."

The process of technological innovation is also a process from nothing to something, from indigenous to foreign, and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. In this regard, we first implemented the spirit of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and self-reliance, mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses in everything. If we did not know the technology, we humbly studied and worked hard; if we did not have the equipment, we used our brains to create it ourselves; if we lacked raw materials, we tried to use old materials and substitutes. For example, if there were no steel plates, we used wooden boards instead, metal supports were replaced with wooden frames, we painted ourselves, turned wooden discs ourselves, wound coils ourselves, pieced together whole materials from scrap materials, and tried to simplify the structure of innovative products, reduce the volume, so that the cost was reduced, the efficiency was not reduced, the use was convenient, and it was suitable for promotion. For example, after repeated research and improvement, the currency counting machine is now not only very small in size, high in efficiency, and accurate in counting, but also can be electric or hand-cranked; it can be counted by electromagnets, and in areas where there is no power supply, it can be counted directly with levers; it can count both main coins and auxiliary coins, so it is suitable for both cities and the countryside.

Third, enlighten the masses' consciousness and cultivate cadres who are both red and expert.

This is the fundamental key to carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution in a big way. In this regard, we first used red and expert schools to give political lessons, often educating all comrades in the bank to actively respond to the Party's call, constantly break superstitions, and boldly create innovations, and specially set up a technological innovation department in the red and expert schools, adopting the method of teaching what is grown, teaching what is lacking, learning from each other, and teaching each other, and constantly improving the ideological understanding and scientific and technological level of comrades. Secondly, on the basis of breaking superstitions and liberating the mind, we enlightened all comrades in the bank to consciously and timely formulate red and expert plans. The branch's various departments, especially the innovation group, conduct detailed research and queuing every month according to the bank's overall plan for technological innovation, specifically stipulating the date and measures for completion of each item, and assigning tasks according to the project, and then incorporating them into each person's small red and expert plan, and earnestly implement them, so that the scheduled projects can generally be completed ahead of schedule or on time with guaranteed quality and quantity.

Fourth, follow the mass line and carry out the red flag movement in a big way.

In this regard, we first achieved monthly segmentation, segmenting by days, grasping the situation every day, analyzing every three days, checking every week, small evaluations every half month, and large evaluations every month, that is, the entire bank has a unified standard for inserting small red flags, mutual small evaluations are conducted within departments every half month, and large evaluations are conducted throughout the bank every month, setting up pacesetters, and launching a wave of learning from advanced, catching up with advanced, and surpassing advanced. Secondly, we regarded technological innovation as a major content and mobilized the masses to compete, mainly comparing the advanced and reliable indicators, comparing the specific and powerful measures, comparing the soaring momentum of hard work, departments, groups, and individuals finding opponents for each other, and carrying out opponent competitions. Thirdly, we strengthened publicity and mobilization work, in addition to promptly publicizing and reporting new achievements in technological innovation made by various departments, groups, and individuals through blackboards, radio stations, and other methods, we also adopted the method of reporting good news and congratulations to commend and encourage them, and constantly improve the enthusiasm of the masses for innovation.

    记账不用笔  点钱不用手
    ——记江苏省南通市人民银行支行的技术革新
    江苏南通市人民银行支行在党的总路线的光辉照耀下和大跃进形势的鼓舞下，今年九个月来，在各项工作全面跃进的同时，完成了革新项目三百九十七项（件），重点创制了电动、手摇、脚踏点钞机，硬币计数、包装器，硬币电动兑换机，自动招呼器，电动传送器，传票装订机，会计、出纳、储蓄工作台，多种形式利息计算器，并改装成功了电动、手摇、脚踏记账机和电动打字机等，逐步武装了全市银行机构。现在记账可以不用笔，算账可以不用算盘，点票可以不用手，传送可以不用人。党的八届八中全会决议公布以后，职工受到极大鼓舞，在9月份，为了向伟大的建国十周年献礼，又创制了“电动点钞、捆把联合机”，这部机器有三大部件和点钞、整理、切纸、捆把、上浆、烘干等十五道工序，全部自动控制联动，而且，不足百张不捆把，超过百张自动剔除。这一项创造的成功，为银行业务的技术革新跃向一个新阶段打下了基础。
    现在在南通市人民银行支行营业间里，放着特制的工作台，桌面向前伸开，代替了古老的柜台，会计员们揿着机器的电钮，计算凭证上的数字。出纳员把钞票一叠叠送进点钞机轻便地整点着。记账工作台上面放着电动、手摇、脚踏各种记账机，会计员揭着凭证，揿动电钮，账页上的借贷、余额便不断地呈现在机上，每小时可记八百笔账，而且完全准确清晰。传递凭证已使用了“电动传递机”。另外，还有打报表机、快速查卡箱、电动公债中签对号器等等，一切主要操作程序都实现了半机械化和工具化。
    南通人民银行支行的“穆桂英”储蓄所，是开展技术革新较好的一个单位。这个所的弧形柜面的两张特制的储蓄工作台，台面清清爽爽，看不到墨水、印台等等办公用具。原来这些用具都被巧妙而合理地安置在工作台里面固定的位置上，储蓄员们要取用各种重要凭证和现钞时，只要把安置在滑槽上的玻璃活动桌面轻轻一推，台前弧形的柜面里，就出现了电动盖章机、电动硬币兑换机、电动找零器、利息查算器、有奖凭证放置器等等。盖章，有电动盖章机，机器能自动地把各种图章一次全部盖好；兑换硬币，只要将电钮一按，所需要的硬币就自动跳出柜面；计算利息也可以不用算盘，看一看“存期查算尺”，拉一下“利息查算器”的履带，揿一揿机器的按钮，应计的利息马上就正确地得出来。工作台中间的一架圆盘形活动账箱，可以前后左右转动，里面装着数千张账页，无论要抽哪一张，只要略加转动，就可应手而得。总之，这里的一切都是按照工作和业务的实际需要而设计制成的，甚至一只痰盂，为了避免用手揭盖，也装上了脚踏自动的开合盖。
    不仅如此，今年八个月来，南通市人民银行支行还与省外一百零八个行、处大搞协作，除供应各行点钞机等图纸、资料二百五十二件以外，并调给兰州、玉门等行记账机和点钞机近二十架。同时，制造了硬币计数器八千套，硬币包装器二百套，供应了省内外兄弟行的需要。
    人们或许要问：“这个行所以能搞出这些革新，一定有一班人马，一套设备，和一定技术条件吧？”其实不然，事实是一无技术人马，二无像样设备，三无技术基础。人是原来做会计员、总务员、点钞员、警卫员的人；工具是几把小鎯头、小锉刀起家，现在也不过多了些自己土制的“土车床”、“土刨床”、“土钻床”等等。主要的是全行职工在党的领导下进行了如下的努力：
    第一，加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅。
    南通人民银行支行专门成立了金融工作科学技术革新小组，书记亲自挂帅，加强了对这项工作的具体领导，特别是政治思想工作的领导。如在技术革新刚开始提出“苦战一年，基本实现会计出纳工作半机械化、工具化”的行动口号时，大部分同志是积极拥护的，但有少数同志却存在着抵触情绪。他们说：“银行不像工厂，怎么能实现机械化。”“南通地方小，银行干部少，技术水平低，要在一年内基本实现机械化，是梦想。”……针对这些思想，除了通过各种方式加强对技术革新重大意义的正面教育外，着重采取了组织力量，突破一点，做出样子，以事实来教育群众的办法。陈昌权等同志创造“硬币计数器”的成功，和第一架电动点钞机的诞生，就有力地打破了对机械化的神秘观点，大大提高了职工信心和决心。很多职工都感动地说：天下无难事，只怕有心人。想不到一向打算盘、点钞票、动笔杆的手，今天也能制造出这样精致的机器来了！
    可是，技术革新毕竟不是一举手、一投足就能成功的，思想解放也不是一朝一夕就能彻底的，如当某些革新成品质量还不够理想，掌握机器的人技术还不熟练，在试用过程中出了些毛病的时候，少数“摇头派”又说创造成功是“吹牛”，说革新出来的是“老爷机器没得用”。这一情况出现后，党组织立即展开了鼓干劲、反右倾的斗争。后来陈昌权等同志创制的硬币计数器远销六百五十多个市、县和提高效率十多倍的事实，给了右倾保守思想以毁灭性的打击以后，技术革新才顺着党所指出的方向顺利开展起来。
    第二，坚决贯彻了多快好省和两条腿走路的方针。
    技术革新的过程，又是一个从无到有，从土到洋，土洋结合的过程。在这方面，首先贯彻了多快好省和自力更生的精神，事事发动群众，依靠群众，技术不会，就虚心苦学苦钻；设备没有，就自己动脑筋创造；原料缺乏，就设法利用旧料和代用品。如钢板没有就改用木板，金属支架改为木架，油漆自己漆，木盘自己车，线圈自己绕，零料拼整料，并尽量简化革新成品的结构，缩小体积，使成本降低，效能不减，使用方便，和宜于推广。如点钞机经过一再研究改进，现在不但体积很小，效率较高，计数准确，而且既能电动又能手摇；既能用电磁铁计数，又可在没有电源供应的地区，直接用杠杆计数；既能点主币，又能点辅币，因此，既适合城市，又适合农村。
    第三，启发群众自觉，培养干部红专。
    这是大搞技术革新和技术革命的根本关键。我们在这方面，首先通过红专学校上政治课，经常教育全行同志积极响应党的号召，不断破除迷信，大胆创造革新，并在红专学校专门设立了技术革新系，采取长什么，教什么，缺什么，学什么，互教互学，教学相长的方法，不断提高同志的思想认识和科学技术水平。其次，在破除迷信，解放思想的基础上，启发全行同志人人自觉地及时地制订红专规划。支行各部门，特别是革新小组，每月均根据全行关于技术革新方面的规划，进行细致的研究排队，逐项具体的订出完成的日期和措施，并按项目进行分工，然后订入各人小段红专规划，切实贯彻执行，因而使预定的项目，一般都能提前或按质按量的如期完成。
    第四，走群众路线，大搞红旗运动。
    在这方面，首先做到了按月分段，按段分天，天天抓情况，三天一分析，一周一检查，半月一小评，每月一大评，即全行订有统一的插小红旗的标准，每半月部门内相互小评一次，每月全行大评一次，树立标兵，掀起学先进、赶先进、超先进的热潮。其次，把技术革新作为一项主要内容发动群众比武，主要是比指标的先进可靠，比措施的具体有力，比干劲的气势冲天，部门、小组和个人相互找对手，开展对手赛。再次，加强了宣传鼓动工作，除通过黑板报、广播台、对各部门、小组和个人在技术革新上所获得的新成就及时宣传报道以外，并采取报喜和祝贺的办法，加以表扬鼓励，不断地提高了群众的革新热情。
