    Using Water Power to Replace Heavy Labor
    Tianzhu Autonomous County Widely Builds Hydropower Stations Using Indigenous Methods, Saving 290,000 Labor Days Annually
    (Our Dispatch) The people of Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County in Gansu Province are utilizing water resources with indigenous methods, obtaining inexpensive and inexhaustible power, and finding a broad path to solve the difficulties of labor shortages. Many small hydropower stations and hydraulic power stations have been established on the county's crisscrossing rivers and irrigation canals. Various indigenous hydraulic machines have been modified and created to replace heavy manual labor, develop community-run industries, and support agricultural and pastoral production.
    Tianzhu County is located at the gateway of the Hexi Corridor and has relatively abundant water resources. The annual flow of the three main rivers in the territory—the Zailang River, the Dajing River, and the Jinqiang River—is more than 500 million cubic meters, with 120 large and small tributaries. In the past, these rivers were mainly used to irrigate farmland. In 1957, the first hydropower station was built here, and the "night pearl" in the farmers' fantasies became the light illuminating their real lives. In 1958, encouraged by the Great Leap Forward, the masses here liberated their minds, used river and canal water as power, and modified and created some hydraulic tools to further utilize water power. After communization, rural areas set up canteens, and with the development of agricultural and pastoral production and community-run industries, the objective situation required huge power. According to the provincial party committee's instructions on the utilization of "five energies" (water, wind, electricity, sun, biology), and considering the characteristics of abundant local water resources, the Tianzhu County Party Committee timely issued a call to the people of the county to widely utilize water energy, adhere to the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the main focus, and with community teams as the main operators, and mobilized the masses to vigorously reform and create hydraulic tools. After this, flowers of water energy utilization bloomed everywhere, and the county wove a brilliant picture of comprehensive utilization of water energy with the water mill as the center. By October of this year, the scope of water energy utilization had expanded to flour milling, oil pressing, cotton ginning, hemp peeling, cement grinding, sawing wood, pulping, grinding ball bearings, iron melting, and power generation. The problem of rural labor shortages has thus been alleviated. According to the current statistics of hydropower stations and hydraulic power stations built in the county (excluding the original old-fashioned water mills), replacing human and animal power with water power can save 290,000 labor days and 460 draft animals annually. The county's newly added power reached 460 horsepower, which is one-quarter more than the original mechanical power of the county. The masses praised, "Hemp peeling, cotton ginning, and oil pressing, multiple productions use water energy, papermaking, sawing wood, and milling flour, water can show its magic everywhere; rural and pastoral areas are brightly lit, broadcasts frequently spread the voice of the Great Leap Forward, utilizing water energy is truly good, a happy life forever."
    The characteristics of the county's extensive use of water energy are: First, all water is used, allowing both large rivers and small canals to show their magic. In addition to building hydropower stations on larger rivers with water flow rates of 1 to 7.9 cubic meters per second, they also fully pay attention to the utilization of tributaries and canals. They built a four-linked water mill on a canal with a flow rate of 0.17 cubic meters per second. This water mill has three times the efficiency of the old-fashioned single-wheel water mill. Using water with a flow rate of less than 0.17 cubic meters per second, they drive a very simple water turbine ball bearing machine, processing more than 4,000 ball bearings day and night, which is 150 times more efficient than manual production. Second, promote the new and eliminate the old, vigorously develop hydraulic power stations, and gradually build hydropower stations. The county has built seven small hydropower stations and has 234 renovated old-fashioned water mills. Among them, 15 old-fashioned water mills can be converted into power stations that can process a variety of products with slight improvements. Third, indigenous methods are used first, and methods are diversified. All modified and created hydraulic machines are made with indigenous methods, which have the advantages of easy manufacturing, small investment, simple operation, easy promotion, high efficiency, and great benefits, which meet the actual needs of the current rural areas. The People's Hero Lake construction site used the old mill site and installed a transmission wheel on the canal to build a 12-kilowatt hydropower station; the cost was only 110 yuan; the pulley of an ordinary cotton gin was changed to a water wheel, becoming a hydraulic cotton gin, the total cost of which was only more than 30 yuan, but the daily amount of cotton ginning was more than twice that of a two-person, two-animal pulley cotton gin. Fourth, develop gradually from simple to complex, from low to high, and continuously improve. Among the hydraulic machines, there are simple structures such as water-powered sieves and water turbine ball bearing machines, as well as more complete automated flour sifting machines. From the perspective of technical complexity, there are simple tools for pulping with stone rollers, and a semi-mechanized paper mill powered by water is also under construction, which is more technically complex.
    Tianzhu County has a vast land and sparse population, abundant material resources, and a very weak industrial base. As a result of vigorously developing water energy utilization, the economy of many communes has undergone new changes. Areas that rarely had industry in the past now have a variety of processing industries. The Gucheng People's Commune, a pastoral area, also used water energy to set up a sawmill; the industry run by the Huangpingchuan People's Commune using water energy has an annual output value of more than 150,000 yuan. The development of community-run industries has enabled many agricultural and sideline products to be processed and utilized reasonably in a timely manner. Now, on the basis of the above-mentioned brilliant achievements, the people of all ethnic groups in Tianzhu have formulated new water energy utilization plans, and will build 60 hydraulic power stations and 15 hydropower stations this winter and next spring, and continue to expand the scope of water energy utilization.
    In view of the great value of Tianzhu's experience, the Gansu Provincial Party Committee has decided to promote it throughout the province.

    利用水力代替繁重劳动
    天祝自治县用土法广建水力站，一年节省29万个劳动日
    本报讯　甘肃省天祝藏族自治县的人民，用土办法利用水力资源，得到了廉价的取之不尽的动力，找到了解决劳动力紧张困难的广阔道路。全县纵横交错的河流和灌溉渠道上，建立起许多小型水电站和水力站，改制和创制各种土水力机械，代替繁重的体力劳动，发展了社办工业，支援了农牧业生产。
    天祝县位居河西走廊门户，水利资源比较丰富。境内三条主要河流——在浪河、大靖河和金强河的年经流量为五亿多公方，大小支流一百二十条。这些河流过去主要用来灌溉农田。1957年这里建成了第一座水电站，农民幻想中的“夜明珠”变为照射他们现实生活的光辉。1958年在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，这里的群众解放思想，利用河水渠水作动力，改制和创造了一些水力机具，进一步利用水力。公社化以后，农村办起食堂，加以农牧业生产和社办工业的发展，客观形势需要有巨大的动力。中共天祝县委根据省委关于“五能”（水、风、电、太阳、生物）利用的指示，考虑到当地水利资源丰富的特点，及时向全县人民发出广泛利用水能的号召，坚持土洋并举、以土为主、以社队办为主方针，动员群众大力改革和创造水力机具。在这以后，水能利用的花朵到处开放，全县以水磨为中心织出一幅综合利用水能的灿烂图景。到今年10月，水能利用范围已扩大到磨面、榨油、弹棉花、剥麻、磨水泥、锯木材、碾纸浆、磨滚珠、化铁和发电等方面，农村劳动力紧张问题从而得到缓和。根据目前全县已建成的水电站和水力站的统计（不包括原有旧式水磨），以水力代替人畜力，全年可节省二十九万个劳动日、节省畜力四百六十头。全县新增加的动力达四百六十马力，比全县原有各种动力的机械能力还多四分之一。群众称赞说：“剥麻弹花又榨油，多种生产用水能，造纸锯木磨面粉，有水皆能显神通；农村牧区灯光明，广播频传跃进声，利用水能真正好，幸福生活万年青”。
    这个县广泛利用水能的特点是：第一、有水皆用，让大河小渠都显神通。除在水流量每秒一公方到七点九公方的较大河流上兴建水电站外，更充分注意利用支流、毛渠。他们在每秒流量零点十七公方的水渠上修建起四联式水磨，这座水磨较旧式单轮水磨工效提高三倍，利用比每秒流量零点十七公方还小的水，打动一个很简单的水轮滚珠器，一昼夜加工四千多粒滚珠，比用手工制作的工效提高了一百五十倍。第二、推陈出新，大力发展水力站，逐步建设水电站。全县已建成七座小型水电站，拥有经过整修的旧式水磨二百三十四座。其中有十五座旧式水磨只要略加改进，即能加工多种多样产品的动力站。第三、土法先上马，方法多样化。改制和创制的全部水力机具，都是用土办法做出来的，具有制作容易、投资很小、操作简单、易于推广、效率很高、收益甚大等优点，符合当前农村的实际需要。人民英雄湖工地利用磨房旧址，在水渠上安了传送轮，便建成一座十二瓩的水电站；造价仅一百一十元；把普通的弹花机的皮带轮改成水轮，成为水力弹花机，全部费用仅三十多元，每日弹花量却比两人两畜的皮带轮弹花机提高两倍多。第四、由简到繁、由低到高，逐步发展，不断提高。在水力机具中，有构造简单的水打箩、水轮滚珠器，也有较完善的自动化箩面器。从技术繁简程度来看，有用石碾碾纸浆的简易工具，也正在建设技术较繁杂的以水为动力的半机械化造纸厂。
    天祝县地广人稀，物质资源丰富，而工业底子非常薄弱。大搞水能利用的结果，许多公社的经济发生新的变化。过去很少有工业的地区，现在有了多种加工工业。牧民聚居地区——古城人民公社也利用水能办起锯木厂；黄平川人民公社利用水能办起来的工业，全年产值在十五万元以上。社办工业的发展，使许多农副产品及时得到加工和合理利用。现在天祝各族人民在取得上述的辉煌成绩的基础上，制订了新的水能利用规划，将在今冬明春兴建水力站六十座，水电站十五座，继续扩大水能利用范围。
    鉴于天祝这个经验很有价值，中共甘肃省委决定在全省范围加以推广。
