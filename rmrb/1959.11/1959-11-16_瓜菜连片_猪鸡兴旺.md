    Melon and Vegetable Patches Connected, Pigs and Chickens Thriving
    By our reporters Yi Dao, Xiang Tao, Wu Zhu

    Just outside Chongqing city proper, a moving scene on the suburban non-staple food base immediately catches the eye. Green vegetable plots stretch out in all directions; a large labor force moves from one plot to another: some picking vegetables, some sowing seeds, some carrying… Tens of thousands of chickens and ducks frolic on the hillsides and in the ponds. The commune's pig farms, poultry farms, and dairy farms are everywhere. Following the clanging of hammers and chisels, rows of new pigsties and poultry farms are being built there.

    Along the way, interspersed with the rural production scene, another busy transportation scene unfolds: wooden boats shuttle back and forth on the river, and cars and carts race along the highway, transporting batches of fat pigs, poultry, and large piles of vegetables to the city and factories. In the past nine months this year, more than 500 million jin of fresh vegetables and 90,000 head of fat pigs have been transported from the suburban base to support the city.

    Vegetables First

    The Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune in the suburbs has converted half of its land into vegetable bases, and vegetable production has developed into large-scale production on a large area. Around the large vegetable plots, roads and ditches crisscross, ponds, manure pits, and reservoirs are densely distributed, and many pumping stations have been built along the river, drawing water up the hillsides and into the vegetable plots.

    "Vegetable base" is just a general term. We saw "small bases" specializing in small varieties, seedbeds for seed retention and nurseries for cultivating seedlings, as well as various kinds of high-yield experimental fields. In the communes we visited, it looked like a rape flower village. Cadres were busy guiding us to see the new varieties they had recently introduced: Zhejiang radishes that filled the fields, high-yielding Shandong parsley, early-maturing Fujian cauliflower, Yunnan twisted melon, Henan Chinese cabbage, and more than one hundred and several dozen new varieties introduced from other places. Every time we went to a vegetable production team, we would encounter commune members organizing warm beds and greenhouses, storing horse manure and cottonseed residue (this is the heating material used for warm bed seedling cultivation). This year, the city will put approximately more than 10,000 seedling cultivation devices into production. After the large-scale seedling cultivation this winter, summer vegetables such as tomatoes, peppers, and pumpkins can be produced in advance next spring to supply the market. Through the hard work of the commune members, the suburban communes have now improved single-season vegetables such as radishes, Chinese cabbage, lettuce, and peppers into all-season vegetables, so they can produce whatever people want to eat, whenever they want to eat it.

    Everyone Raises Pigs

    Connected to the vegetable plots, we saw large and small pig farms dotted across the vast fields of the suburbs.

    The several thousand-pig farms we visited could be described as huge fat pig production "factories." Rows of pigsties are connected together. Here, sows, boars, piglets, feeder pigs, and fat pigs are all raised and managed in separate groups and batches, and each production process from piglet breeding to fat pig release is linked in an orderly manner. No matter which pigsty or field we went to, it was as clean as if it had been washed with water, and it was difficult to smell any stench. Many pigsties have small medical rooms dedicated to treating common pig diseases. At the Wulidian thousand-pig farm in the suburbs, we visited the breeding base's veterinary hospital, veterinary medicine factory, feed processing factory, connected feed base, and a specialized team that grows feed. Advanced breeding bases also have scientific research institutions dedicated to studying and summarizing fattening methods for pigs and preventing and controlling pig diseases. This year, more than 2,300 large and small breeding farms have been established throughout the city. They are a backbone of the breeding base. Batches of fat pigs are transported from here to cities and factories, providing the country with a large number of commercial pigs.

    Large-scale pig raising is not the whole picture of pig raising we saw in the countryside. In every commune we visited, we saw thousands of commune member households raising pigs on behalf of the commune, with some families raising them and some forming breeding groups to raise them together.

    Many Hundred-Poultry Households

    Speaking of small poultry, people often think of the large and small poultry farms and the "ten thousand chicken mountains" where chickens and ducks are everywhere. However, in the mountain city, in addition to more than 400 collective breeding farms, there are also many hundred-poultry households, which are like cells in the base, scattered in the vast countryside, supporting the city with a huge amount of non-staple food.

    In the many communes we visited, we personally saw that in many commune members' homes that were quite spacious in the past, many places have now become "dormitories" for chickens and ducks; in many open bamboo forests and hillsides, there are rows of newly built chicken coops, and almost every commune now has a fully equipped hatchery (there are 190 in the city). In some areas with a high concentration of hundred-poultry households, every morning, when the chicken coops are first opened and the poultry move out, the hillsides, streams, and bamboo forests are full of flocks of chickens and ducks, making people feel as if they are in a ten-thousand chicken farm.

    We visited the Sihe Production Brigade of the Mudong Commune. This is a remote mountain village, but these more than 130 farm households raised more than 13,000 small poultry, and every household has become a hundred-poultry household. In a courtyard, we met Granny Wang, who is around sixty years old, but the old couple raised three fat pigs and a large flock of chickens and ducks. Whenever the chicks grow fat and strong, she always sells them all to the national purchasing station, and she is reluctant to eat even an egg herself.

    In the brigade's hatching room, we met Brigade Leader Li Xiangyi, who started chatting with us like an old friend as soon as he saw us. Li Xiangyi originally only knew a little about hatching techniques, but after hard work and research, he finally mastered the "rice husk insulation hatching method" and hatched chicks and ducklings in large quantities. In the second and third quarters, this brigade supported the city with an average of four chickens and ducks per person, and nearly 10,000 breeding chickens and breeding ducks supported neighboring areas.

    They Have a Share Too

    In Chongqing, not only are there flocks of chickens and ducks and pigs in the pens in the communes, but also in the factories, mines, busy offices, and vast residential areas where machines roar, you can see flocks of chickens, ducks, pigs, and patches of vegetable plots. This year, when the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all the people to take action to vigorously develop non-staple food production, units of all sizes took action together, and cadres, workers, students, commercial employees, soldiers, and residents used their spare time to build pigsties and reclaim wasteland. In less than half a year, units throughout the city collectively raised more than 90,000 pigs and more than 940,000 small poultry, and planted more than 20,000 mu of vegetables. After overcoming the severe drought, they also harvested more than 7,500 dan of sunflower seeds and more than 800 dan of sesame seeds, which can be pressed into 160,000 jin of oil, equivalent to the harvest of more than 25,000 mu of cultivated land. Amidst the cheers of celebration, the staff, students, soldiers, and residents of various units planted more than 80 million "rape king" plants in October. More than 350 units in the city have achieved self-sufficiency in pork.

    This year, Chongqing is not only self-sufficient in pigs, chickens, ducks, and vegetables, but also fish, edible oil, tea, cattle, sheep, fruits, and sugar have also developed greatly. This mountain city, which originally did not produce fish, raised more than 220 million fish fry this year. Currently, groups of fishing teams have begun to catch mature fish.

    瓜菜连片　猪鸡兴旺
    本报记者　宜道　祥涛　吴竹
    一出重庆城区，市郊副食品基地上的一幅动人的景象，马上映入我们的眼帘。绿油油的蔬菜地向四面伸展开；劳动大军从这片菜地移动到那片菜地：有摘菜的、撒种的、搬运的……。成千上万的鸡群、鸭群在山坡、池塘里嬉戏。公社的养猪场、养禽场、奶牛场满目皆是。随着叮叮当当的锤石声望去，一排排的新猪舍，一个个的养禽场，正在那里兴建起来。
    沿途，夹杂在农村大生产的景色中，又呈现了另一番繁忙的运输景象：穿梭似地行驶在江面上的木船，奔驰在公路上的汽车、架架车，正把一批批的肥猪、家禽和大堆大堆的蔬菜运往城市和工厂。今年9个多月中，从市郊基地运出支援城市的鲜菜达五亿多斤，肥猪九万头。
    蔬菜第一
    市郊中苏友好人民公社有半数的土地改造成了蔬菜基地，蔬菜生产已经发展到大面积的大规模生产了。大片大片的菜地周围，道路、沟渠纵横，池塘、粪池、水库密布，沿江两岸已兴建了许多个抽水机站，一股股的江水被抽上了山坡，流向菜地里。
    “蔬菜基地”不过是一个总称呼。我们见到的有专种小品种的“小基地”，有专留种籽的种籽地和培育菜苗的苗圃，以及各种名目的高产试验田。在我们到过的那些公社，一眼望去，简直如菜花之乡。干部忙着指引我们去看他们最近引进的新品种：长满了田野的浙江大萝卜、高产的山东香芹菜、早熟的福建花菜和云南的绞瓜、河南的大白菜，从外地引进的新品种足足有一百几十个。每到一个蔬菜生产队，总会碰上社员们在整理温床、温室，储存马粪和棉籽渣（这是温床育苗用的酿热材料）。今年全市约有一万多个育苗设备将投入生产。经过今冬的大量育苗，明年春天就能提前生产出夏季蔬菜，如番茄、海椒和南瓜等供应市场。经过社员们的艰苦劳动，现在市郊公社已把萝卜、白菜、窝笋、海椒等一季蔬菜改良为四季菜了，人们爱什么时候吃，他们就什么时候生产。
    大家养猪
    和蔬菜地紧连的，我们在市郊广阔的原野上，见到了星罗棋布的大大小小的养猪场。
    我们曾参观过的几个千猪场，如果说它们是一个个庞大的肥猪生产“工厂”也不为过。场地上一排排猪舍连成一片，这里，母猪、公猪、仔猪、架子猪和大肥猪都是分群分批饲养管理的，从小猪繁殖到肥猪出槽，每个生产工序连结得井井有条。无论到哪个猪舍、场地，都整洁得如同水洗过一般，很难闻到臭气；不少猪舍设有小医疗室，专治一般猪病。在市郊五里店千猪场，我们参观了饲养基地的兽医院、兽药厂、饲料加工厂、连片的饲料基地和种植饲料的专业队。先进的饲养基地还有科学研究机构，专门研究和总结生猪催肥法和防治猪病。今年全市建立的大、小饲养场有二千三百多个，它们是饲养基地上的一批骨干，成批的肥猪从这里运往城市和工厂，为国家提供了大量的商品猪。
    大群养猪不是我们在农村见到的养猪的全貌。每到一个公社，我们见到成千个社员户替公社代养着猪群，有的一家人喂养，也有几家成立饲养小组共同喂养的。
    许许多多百禽户
    提起小家禽，人们往往会想起那大大小小的养禽场和那鸡鸭遍野的“万鸡山”。然而，在山城，除了四百多个集体饲养场以外，还有着许许多多百禽户，它们像基地的细胞，散布在广大农村中，以巨大数量的副食品支援着城市。
    我们在访问过的许多公社里，曾经亲眼看到，在许多过去居住得相当宽敞的社员家里，现在许多地方都成了鸡鸭的“宿舍”；在许多空旷的竹林里、山岗上，到处是新建的一排排的鸡埘，几乎每个公社现在都有了设备齐全的孵化室（全市有一百九十个）。在一些百禽户特别集中的地方，每当清晨，鸡埘初放、群禽出动的时候，那山岗上、小溪旁、竹林里，到处是一群群的鸡、鸭，使人如置身在万鸡场里。
    我们曾经访问过木洞公社的四合生产大队，这是个偏僻的山村，然而这一百三十多户农家却喂了一万三千多只小家禽，家家都成了百禽户。在一个院子里我们碰到了王老太婆，她已经六十岁上下，可是老俩口却喂了三口肥猪和一大群鸡鸭，每当雏鸡长得又肥又壮时，她总是全都卖给国家收购站，自己连个蛋也舍不得吃。
    在大队的孵化房里，我们碰到了大队长李祥益，他一见到我们就像老朋友一样地攀谈起来。李祥益原来只懂得一点孵抱技术，经过刻苦钻研，终于掌握了“稻谷保温孵化法”，大批地孵出了小鸡小鸭。在二、三季度，这个大队平均每人支援了城市四只鸡鸭，还有近万只种鸡、种鸭支援邻区。
    也有他们的份
    在重庆，不但公社里鸡鸭成群，猪满圈，在机器声隆隆的工厂、矿山、工作繁忙的机关和广大的居民区里，都能见到成群的鸡、鸭、猪和一片片的菜地。今年，当中共重庆市委号召全民动手大搞副食品生产的时候，大大小小的单位一齐动手，干部、工人、学生、商业职工、部队战士和居民，利用业余时间，修建猪圈，开垦荒土。不出半年，全市各单位集体饲养了九万多头猪和九十四万多只小家禽，种了二万多亩蔬菜。他们还在战胜特大干旱以后，收获了葵瓜子七千五百多担、芝麻八百多担，这批油料可以榨油十六万斤，相当于二万五千多亩耕地的收获量。在庆贺丰收声中，各单位职工、学生、部队和居民又在10月间种下了八千多万株“油菜王”。全市已有三百五十多个单位做到猪肉自给。
    重庆今年不仅猪、鸡、鸭和蔬菜已经生产自给了，鱼、食油、茶、牛、羊、水果、糖也有了很大发展。这个素不产鱼的山城，今年养了二亿二千多万尾鱼苗，目前，成群的捕捞队已经开始打捞成鱼。
