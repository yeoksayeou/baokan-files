    The current light industry is in a new upsurge of production and construction. This upsurge was launched under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose rightist tendencies, encourage greater effort, and carry out a mass movement to increase production and practice economy. The broad masses of workers on the light industry front, under this great call of the Party Central Committee, exposed and criticized the rightist emotions and rightist thinking of a few cadres, resulting in a new situation of rising output every ten days and increasing output every month. According to statistics on 32 major products, 22 products in September increased by more than 20% compared with August, and other products also had different degrees of increase. Some major products, such as alcohol, thermos bottles, clocks, cameras, and film, have already reached or exceeded the total annual output of the Great Leap Forward year of 1958 in the first nine months of this year. The restoration and development of daily-use handicraft products has been very rapid. In terms of variety, it has approached the original varieties of last year, and some regions have exceeded the original varieties. Traditional products and famous brands in various places have been restored and produced in batches, and many new varieties have also been added. In this production upsurge, due to the continued vigorous technological innovation and technological revolution, and due to the improvement of enterprise management, high output, high quality, low consumption, and safety have all blossomed in an all-round way. For example, the Yingkou Paper Mill in Liaoning Province launched a red flag competition, and 70% of the shifts and teams in the factory have achieved full red flags, and the plans for output, quality, consumption, and safety have all been completed. The average daily pulp production in September increased by 25% compared with August; the small dust particles per square millimeter of reed pulp in early September decreased by 36% compared with August; the coal consumption per ton of pulp was saved by 12%; and seven of the eight paper machines achieved 24-hour safe operation throughout the process. There are many, many such advanced examples. Now, the light industry front is showing a leaping forward scene everywhere, and we are fully confident that this year's production plan will be completed ahead of schedule and exceeded.
    Light industry and handicrafts directly shoulder the great task of meeting the needs of the people's livelihood and supporting the needs of industrial and agricultural production. The broad masses of workers in the light industry departments must not be satisfied with the achievements made in the past and present. With the continuous leap forward of the national economy and the continuous improvement of the people's purchasing power, we should strive to adapt to this rising demand. The task now before us is clearly pointed out in Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report at the Conference of Heroes: "On the basis of the comprehensive and rapid development of agriculture, light industry production should be actively developed in 1960 to supply the people with more daily necessities." At the same time, it also pointed out: "Supporting agricultural construction and promoting the development of agricultural production is an increasingly important task for industrial departments in the future." We know that supporting agriculture and promoting agricultural leap forward is not only an urgent requirement of agriculture itself, but also an urgent requirement of industry, especially light industry. In supporting the development of agricultural production, in addition to supplying the countryside with more and better light industrial products, light industry should also take the initiative to assist agriculture in improving and promoting good varieties of economic crops, improving cultivation techniques, and making development plans; developing agricultural and sideline product processing industries to liberate rural labor; doing a good job in the manufacture and repair of small farm tools to serve agricultural production; and the waste materials processed by factories that can be used as feed and fertilizer should be used to support rural needs.
    Can light industry production continue to leap forward? It is entirely possible. We have many favorable factors, mainly: the leadership of party committees at all levels, and the Party's general line is more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Great mass movements have been carried out in industrial enterprises, and the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" system has been implemented, and rich experience has been gained in enterprise management. In addition, this year's bumper harvest of grain and cash crops in summer and autumn, and the supply of industrial raw materials and equipment can basically be further satisfied. At the same time, there is still great production potential in the original light industry enterprises. As long as we fully understand and utilize all these favorable factors, it is entirely possible to realize the continued leap forward of light industry.
    In order to ensure the completion of this year's plan ahead of schedule and to achieve a continued leap forward next year, we should focus on doing the following things at present:
    First, we must seize the production work in the fourth quarter of this year. We should continue to implement the spirit of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, strengthen socialist and communist education in enterprises, and improve the class consciousness of workers; promote the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy more widely, deeply, and persistently, and strive to complete this year's production plan half a month ahead of schedule. On this basis, prepare for next year's production, especially for the first quarter. At present, we must seize the production preparation work before each month and each ten days, carry out equipment maintenance in a planned way, organize the supply of raw materials, pay attention to production safety and the rational allocation of labor organization, actively organize balanced production, and break the abnormal "routine" of being loose at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month, so that production can be rhythmically carried out to achieve daily red, ten-day high, and stable monthly increase.
    Second, continue to vigorously launch the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution. Technological innovation and technological revolution must be centered on "high output, high quality, low consumption, and safety." All technological innovations and technological revolutions must be carried out around the current key to production. Only in this way can the goals be clear, the forces concentrated, and the key to production can be quickly broken through and continue to leap forward. Each industry and each enterprise has different key points in production at different times. At present, the focus of light industry's vigorous technological innovation and technological revolution should generally be on vigorously saving raw materials, improving product quality, improving tools and equipment, and improving labor productivity. Therefore, at present, light industry with a large proportion of manual operation should strive to realize semi-mechanization and mechanization according to existing conditions. County and commune industries should focus on improving technology, improving equipment, improving technological operations, improving product quality, and reducing raw material consumption, vigorously carry out technological innovation, and pass the technical barrier. All new technologies and new experiences must be tested. All those that have been proven effective through testing must be resolutely promoted.
    Third, continue to develop local industries, handicrafts, and commune industries. Since last year, thousands of local industries and commune industries have been established across the country, which have played a great role in supporting agricultural production and meeting the needs of rural people's lives. We must continue to implement the policy of supporting agricultural production and serving agriculture. Under the condition of increasing agricultural raw materials, continue to develop local industries, handicrafts, and commune industries this winter and next spring, better utilize local resources, increase production, vigorously carry out comprehensive utilization of raw materials, and vigorously develop fertilizers and feeds. Implement the method of small and medium-sized enterprises as the main, indigenous methods, and the combination of indigenous and foreign methods to improve labor productivity, reduce and liberate women's family labor, and increase local fiscal revenue, commune income, and member income. Through the above tasks, support agricultural production and meet the needs of the vast rural people's lives.
    Fourth, carry out socialist labor emulation more widely, deeply, and persistently on the light industry front. Experience has proved that this is one of the most effective ways to help the backward catch up with the advanced and promote the continuous rise of production. At present, there are many forms of competition carried out by light industry in various places. The purpose is to facilitate comparison, easily show the advanced and backward, and promote the backward to catch up with the advanced. This kind of competition movement should be consolidated and continued. In the upsurge of competition, advanced collectives and advanced producers should give full play to their leading role, backbone role, and bridge role. The broad masses of ordinary producers should also strive to be upstream and set off a wave of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced. In this way, more advanced units and advanced producers can emerge, and production leap forward will be more guaranteed, and our cause can become more and more prosperous.

    当前轻工业的形势和任务
    轻工业部部长　李烛尘
    当前轻工业正处在一个新的生产建设高潮中。这个高潮，是在党的八届八中全会发出反右倾、鼓干劲、开展群众性的增产节约运动的号召下开展起来的。轻工业战线上的广大职工在党中央这个伟大号召下，揭发和批判了少数干部中的右倾情绪、右倾思想，使生产上出现了旬旬上升、月月增长的新局面。据三十二种主要产品的统计，9月份有二十二种产品比8月份产量增长20％以上，其他产品也都有不同程度的增长。有些主要产品，如酒精、热水瓶、钟表、照相机、胶卷等，今年头九个月的产量，已经达到或者超过了大跃进的1958年全年产量。日用手工业产品恢复和发展得很快，从品种上来说，已经接近去年原有的品种，有些地区已经超过原有的品种，各地传统产品和名牌货都已恢复和成批生产，同时还增加了不少新品种。在这次生产高潮中，由于继续大搞技术革新和技术革命，由于改进了企业管理，因此，高产与优质、低耗、安全全面开花。像辽宁营口造纸厂，开展了红旗竞赛，全厂现有70％的班组达到了满堂红，产量、质量、消耗、安全都完成了计划。9月份平均日产浆量比8月份提高25％；9月上旬苇浆每平方毫米的小尘埃比8月减少36％；每吨浆的煤耗节约12％；八台抄纸机有七台达到了全程二十四小时安全运转。像这样的先进事例是很多很多的。现在轻工业战线上到处呈现着跃进景象，我们完全有把握地说，今年生产计划一定能够提前超额完成。
    轻工业和手工业直接担负着满足人民生活需要和支援工农业生产需要的巨大任务，轻工业部门的广大职工决不能满足于过去和现在所取得的成就。随着国民经济的不断跃进，人民购买力不断提高，我们应当努力去适应这个高涨的要求。现在摆在我们面前的任务，就是李富春副总理在群英会所作的报告中明确指出的：“在农业全面地、迅速地发展的基础上，1960年应当积极发展轻工业的生产，以供应人民更多的生活必需品”。同时又指出：“支援农业建设，促进农业生产的发展，是工业部门在今后时期愈来愈重要的任务”。我们知道，支援农业，促进农业跃进，这不但是农业本身的迫切要求，而且也是工业、特别是轻工业的迫切要求。轻工业在支援农业生产发展方面，除了供应农村更多更好的轻工业品外，还应当主动协助农业改进和推广优良经济作物品种，提高栽培技术，作好发展规划；发展农副产品加工工业，解放农村劳动力；作好小农具的制造和修配，为农业生产服务；工厂加工的下脚料，凡是可以作饲料和肥料的，都应当支援农村需要。
    能不能使轻工业生产继续大跃进呢？肯定地说，是完全可能的。我们有着许多有利的因素，主要是：各级党委的领导，党的总路线更加深入人心。在工业企业中大搞群众运动，实行“两参一改三结合”，在企业管理上取得了丰富的经验。加上今年夏秋粮食和经济作物获得丰收，工业原料和设备的供应也基本上可以进一步获得满足。同时轻工业原有企业还存在着很大的生产潜力。所有这些有利因素，只要我们充分加以认识和加以利用，实现轻工业继续跃进是完全可以的。
    为了保证提前超额完成今年计划和取得明年的继续跃进，当前我们应着重抓紧做好下面几件事情：
    首先，必须抓紧今年第四季度的生产工作。应该继续贯彻党的八届八中全会决议的精神，在企业中加强社会主义和共产主义教育，提高职工阶级觉悟；把增产节约群众运动更加广泛、深入、持久地向前推进，争取提前半个月超额完成今年的生产计划。在这个基础上为明年、首先为第一季度生产做好准备工作。当前必须抓紧做好每月、每旬之前的生产准备工作，有计划地进行设备检修，组织原材料供应，注意生产安全和劳动组织的合理调配，积极组织均衡生产，打破月初松、月末紧的那种不正常的“常规”，使生产有节奏地做到日日红、旬旬高、月月稳定地上升。
    第二，继续大闹技术革新、技术革命的群众性运动。技术革新、技术革命，必须以“高产、优质、低耗、安全”为中心。一切技术革新、技术革命都必须围绕当前生产关键来进行，只有这样，才能目标明确，力量集中，才能很快地突破生产关键，不断跃进。各行业、各企业在不同时期都有不同的生产关键。当前轻工业大搞技术革新、技术革命的重点，一般说来，要放在大力节约原材料、提高产品质量、改进工具设备、提高劳动生产率。因此，目前手工操作比重较大的轻工业，应根据现有条件，努力实现半机械化、机械化。县社工业，应以提高技术、改进设备、改进工艺操作、提高产品质量、降低原材料损耗为中心，大搞技术革新，过好技术关。一切新技术、新经验，都必须经过试验，凡是试验证明确有成效的，必须坚决推广。
    第三，继续发展地方工业、手工业、公社工业。去年以来，全国各地兴办了成千上万的地方工业和公社工业，对支援农业生产和满足农村人民生活需要起了很大作用。我们要继续贯彻支援农业生产、为农业服务为主的方针。在农业原料增长的条件下，今冬明春继续发展地方工业、手工业、公社工业，更好地利用当地的资源，增加生产，大搞原料综合利用，大搞肥料和饲料。实行中小为主，土法上马、土洋结合的办法，以提高劳动生产率，减轻和解放妇女家庭劳动，增加地方财政收入、公社收入和社员收入。通过上述各项工作，来支援农业生产，满足农村广大人民的生活需要。
    第四，在轻工业战线上更广泛、深入、持久地开展社会主义劳动竞赛。经验证明，这是帮助落后赶上先进，促进生产不断高涨的一种最有效办法。现在各地轻工业开展的竞赛形式很多，其目的都是便于对比，易于显出先进和落后，以促进落后赶上先进。应当把这种竞赛运动加以巩固并持续下去。在竞赛高潮中，先进集体和先进生产者要充分发挥带头作用、骨干作用、桥梁作用。广大普通的生产者，也要力争上游，掀起学先进、赶先进的热潮。这样，就可以出现更多的先进单位和先进生产者，生产跃进也就越有保证，我们的事业就能更加蒸蒸日上。
