Wang Jinyu is the coal mining team leader of the Shitanjing Coal Mine Construction Company in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Whether above ground or underground, whether in the local area or transferred to other places, whether the weather is good or bad, whether the work is difficult or easy, and whether it is day or night shift, Wang Jinyu and his team members are full of energy. The team he leads consistently overfulfills its tasks, has never had any production accidents, and has therefore continuously won production red banners. Wang Jinyu himself has never been absent from work and has been named a production model and advanced producer nine times.

Wang Jinyu is twenty-nine years old this year, a Hui nationality, and a Communist Party member. Three generations of his family have been coal miners. His grandfather and father worked hard in the coal mines all their lives. Wang Jinyu began mining coal at the age of thirteen, suffering from the cruel exploitation of feudal foremen, working fifteen or sixteen hours a day, and still living a life worse than that of beasts of burden. His grandfather died of exhaustion and spitting blood, and his father was also injured and lost his ability to work. Life became increasingly difficult. After liberation, he turned over and became the master of the country. During the democratic reforms in 1952, the Party led him and his companions to remove the evil foremen, underground production became safer, and life became better and better, which further increased his boundless love for the Party and the new society. Because of this, Wang Jinyu resolutely listened to the Party's words and was very active in any labor.

In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, Wang Jinyu prominently displayed his excellent qualities. In 1958, the leaders of the autonomous region decided to vigorously develop new mining areas in the desolate mountain沟—Shitanjing. At this time, Wang Jinyu thought that as a Communist Party member, he should always stand at the forefront of difficulties, meet difficulties, overcome difficulties, and seek training in difficulties. He and his team members responded to the Party's call and took on the task of being the vanguard in the development of the Shitanjing mining area. At that time, the mine had not yet been opened, and there were no houses to live in, so they had to dig窑洞 in the mountains and go up the mountains to 打石片. At this time, a few comrades thought, "We are coal miners, we can't do 打石片." But Wang Jinyu thought: Without 打石片, the well cannot be built, and the house cannot be built. He persuaded the comrades in the group, boosted their energy, and immediately opened up mountains and ridges, broke rocks to obtain stones, and overfulfilled the plan in the first month.

Soon, Wang Jinyu and his partners encountered the sandstorm season. Working in the field, the wind blew so hard that they couldn't open their eyes. Wang Jinyu thought that it was not enough to just work hard and vigorously, but also to work cleverly. So, according to the law of strong winds after nine o'clock every day, he proposed to the work area party branch the method of going to work earlier, working hard in small winds, and working little in large winds. This suggestion was immediately supported by the party branch and agreed to by all the comrades in the group, and it was decided to go up the mountain at four o'clock and go down the mountain at nine o'clock every day. At first, when everyone did this, they were not used to it, so he took the lead and got up at three o'clock every day to call everyone. In this way, they avoided the attack of wind and sand, accelerated the construction speed, and increased the average amount of stone mining per person per day by more than three times, becoming the red banner of 打石片 in the entire mining area. This not only guaranteed the needs of brick arch, stone arch, and adobe arch workshops, but also guaranteed the片石 needed for the "local method" to start up a pair of mines with an annual output of 600,000 tons.

In May of this year, Wang Jinyu was transferred to the Shitanjing water coal mining窑, and encountered new difficulties. The roadway of the water窑 is long, and the hardness of the coal seam is not accurately grasped, and there is waste in 打眼放炮. At this time, the Party called for launching a red banner competition movement centered on technological innovation. Wang Jinyu and the comrades in the group actively studied and quickly mastered the softness and hardness of the coal seam, found the method of triangular 打眼, and changed the original two people 打眼 to one person捣眼. In this way, not only can an average of three detonators and eighteen sections of explosives be saved every day, but the blasting rate is also 50% higher than before, and the coal output is rapidly increased. In August, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party called for opposing right-leaning, boosting morale, and completing production tasks ahead of schedule to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Their group was even more full of energy, and they overfulfilled their tasks by 50% in August, and the output in September increased by 50% compared to August.

Wang Jinyu's team pays great attention to training new workers and gives them enthusiastic care in all aspects. They focus on ideology, life, and production; and solve problems in a timely manner. All the new workers assigned to their team are happy and at ease with production. They assign dedicated personnel to help new workers, and adopt the "one thing, one training" method to ensure that new workers quickly master operational technical experience. In just half a year, their team trained fourteen group leaders and sent them to new work surfaces, effectively supporting the production of the mining area.

Wang Jinyu's team also pays great attention to production safety. They advocate "boldness and carefulness" and promptly explain the operating procedures to new workers. They have also established a strict shift handover system and adhere to mine mouth meetings. When 放炮, they must stand guard, and after 放炮, properly clean the top plate and deal with哑炮. Therefore, they have never had an accident and have long guaranteed safe production.

    王进玉——宁夏煤矿建井的红旗
    王进玉是宁夏回族自治区石炭井煤矿建井公司采煤组长。不论在井上或井下，不论在本地或调到外地，不论天气好或坏，不论工作难或易，也不论日班或夜班，王进玉和他小组的同志们，都干劲十足。他领导小组经常超额完成任务，没有发生过生产事故，因而不断地获得生产红旗。王进玉个人从来没有缺过勤，曾经先后九次被评为生产模范和先进生产者。
    王进玉今年二十九岁，回族，是共产党员。他一家三辈子都是煤矿工人。他的祖父和父亲在煤矿上苦干了一辈子。王进玉十三岁起就下矿采煤，受着封建把头的残酷剥削，一天劳动十五、六个钟头，仍然过着牛马不如的生活。他祖父累得吐血死去，父亲也被砸伤，失去了劳动能力。生活越过越苦。解放以后，他才翻了身，当了国家的主人。1952年民主改革的时候，党领导他和同伴们搬掉了万恶的把头，井下生产越来越安全，生活也越过越好，更使他对党和新社会增长了无比的热爱。正因为这样，在任何劳动中，王进玉都坚决听党的话，都非常积极。
    大跃进的1958年，王进玉突出地表现了他的优秀品质。1958年自治区领导上决定在荒无人烟的山沟——石炭井，大力开发新矿区。这时候王进玉想，自己是一个共产党员，在任何时候都应该站在困难的最前面，迎接困难，战胜困难，在困难中求得锻炼。他和小组同志响应了党的号召，担负了开发石炭井矿区的先头部队的任务。当时矿井没有开，又没有房子住，他们得靠山挖窑洞，上山打石片。这时少数同志认为：“我们是采煤的，打石片可不能干”。但是王进玉想：不打石片，井不能建，房子也不能盖。他说服组里的同志，鼓起干劲，立即开山劈岭，破岩取石，在第一个月就超额完成了计划。
    不久，王进玉和他的伙伴们，遇到了大风砂季节。在野外干活，风刮得眼睛都睁不开。王进玉想，光苦干、猛干不行，还得巧干。于是他就根据每天九点以后刮大风的规律，向工区党支部提出提早上班、小风猛干、大风小干的办法。这个建议立即得到了党支部的支持和全组同志们的同意，随即决定每天四点上山，九点下山。起初这样干的时候，大家不习惯，他就以身作则，每天三点起床喊叫大家。就这样，他们避免了风砂的袭击，加快了建设速度，把每人每天平均采石两立方的工作量提高了三倍以上，成为全矿区打石片的红旗。这不仅保证了建筑砖拱、石拱、土坯拱的工房的需要，同时也保证了一对年产六十万吨的矿井“土法上马”所需要的片石。
    今年5月，王进玉被调到石炭井水采煤窑，又遇到了新的困难。水窑的巷道长，煤层的硬度掌握不准，打眼放炮都有浪费。这时，党号召开展以技术革新为中心的红旗竞赛运动。王进玉和小组的同志们积极钻研，很快就掌握了煤层的软硬情况，找到了三角打眼的方法，并把原来两个人打眼改为一个人捣眼。这样，不仅每天平均可以节约雷管三个、炸药十八节，爆破率还比原来提高50％，煤产量迅速提高。8月间，党的八届八中全会号召反右倾、鼓干劲，提前完成生产任务，迎接建国十周年。他们小组更是个个干劲冲天，8月份超额50％完成了任务，9月份的产量又比8月份增长了50％。
    王进玉小组十分注意培养新工人，对于新来的工人，他们从各方面给予热情的关怀。他们抓思想，抓生活，抓生产；遇有问题，及时解决。凡是分配到他们小组的新工人，个个都精神愉快，安心生产。他们指定专人帮助新工人，采取“一事一训”的办法，保证新工人很快掌握操作技术经验。在短短的半年中，他们小组培养了十四个小组长输送给新的工作面工作，有力地支援了矿区的生产。
    王进玉小组也很注意生产安全。他们提倡“胆大心细”，并及时地向新工人讲解操作规程。他们还建立了严格的交接班制度，坚持井口会议。放炮的时候，一定站岗哨，放炮以后妥善清理顶板和处理瞎炮。因此，他们从没有发生过一次事故，长期保证了安全生产。
