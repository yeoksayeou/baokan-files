    Enthusiasm, Warmth, Cold Water
    Gong Tongwen

    In our country, which is still poor and backward for the time being, the most valuable thing is the revolutionary enthusiasm generated by the strong desire of 650 million people to rapidly change this poor and backward state. The task of our Party is to be good at cherishing and developing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. The Party's general line for socialist construction has greatly stimulated this revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, creating the leap forward situation since last year. Wherever there is Party leadership, wherever the general line is adhered to and implemented, there is a lively atmosphere.

    However, within our Party, there is a small handful of right-leaning opportunists who have no enthusiasm at all in the face of the vibrant revolutionary struggle. Where has their enthusiasm gone? Perhaps it has long turned into "cold water" in the "cold air" created by themselves and domestic and foreign reactionaries. Are they not precisely pouring this "cold water" on the fire-like revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses?

    Water and fire are incompatible, and we will never allow right-leaning opportunists to pour cold water on the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses!

    This happened not long ago: in Wuhan, Hubei Province, a small handful of right-leaning opportunists were creating "cold air," and some people who "caught a cold" in the "cold air" followed behind the right-leaning opportunists, shouting about "difficulties." At that time, how could they have expected that they would overfulfill the state-assigned annual plan ahead of schedule? Once the struggle against right-leaning opportunism was launched, Wuhan became lively, and the city's total industrial output value for 1959 had already overfulfilled the state-assigned annual plan fifty-three days ahead of schedule on November 8. Look, isn't the most valuable thing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses! Isn't right-leaning opportunism something that must be thoroughly opposed!

    Carrying the struggle against right-leaning opportunism through to the end is mainly to protect and develop the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, and at the same time, it is also to pull out the right-leaning opportunists who are trapped in the quagmire of bourgeois individualism and cannot extricate themselves. Doctors are not afraid of patients' contagions, nor do they care that patients are ticklish or afraid of pain. They dare to give patients injections and perform operations seriously, with the aim of eliminating the germs that patients have been infected with and making patients healthy. Similarly, we Communists, on the one hand, must resolutely eliminate the right-leaning opportunist "germs" that endanger the Party and the people, and on the other hand, we cannot turn a blind eye to our comrades falling into the quagmire without giving them a hand. Despite the fact that right-leaning opportunists pour cold water on our cause, we are still full of comradely enthusiasm towards right-leaning opportunists. To achieve this, we must follow the policy of "unity—criticism—unity," adopt the method of presenting the facts and reasoning, and conduct serious criticism and education of comrades who have made right-leaning opportunist errors.

    But at this moment, something between "hot" and "cold" has emerged, and that is the "warm sentimentality" appreciated by some comrades. When they see their comrades trapped in the quagmire, they not only do not reach out to pull them out, but also nag endlessly to the comrades who are trying hard to pull them out: "Don't go too far," "Stop when appropriate." How nice it sounds, but if you carefully measure it, this "affection" is not only not "warm" at all, but simply cold-blooded!

    Because the person who made the mistake is your old superior, old colleague, old subordinate, old friend, or some "relative," you engage in a bit of "warm sentimentality," and hesitatingly say something like "Struggle? Cannot 'not,' nor can it be 'too'..." "Too" what? Too excessive? Is letting him always be trapped in the quagmire "stopping when appropriate"? Is pulling him a little harder considered "going too far"? Warm sentimentalists, how heartless you are! When your old superior, old colleague, old subordinate, old friend, or some "relative" pours cold water on the masses, what do you think? Where has your "warmth" gone? Is your "affection" for right-leaning opportunists "warmer" than your "affection" for the people? If that's the case, it's really dangerous!

    It seems that in a political struggle like anti-right-leaning opportunism, even a little bit of warm sentimentality is not allowed. For us, the most valuable thing is enthusiasm, true revolutionary enthusiasm. We should use this revolutionary enthusiasm to protect the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, and we should also use this revolutionary enthusiasm to save those comrades who have made right-leaning opportunist errors. Our Party has always been full of revolutionary enthusiasm. The people compare our Party to the sun, because it gives people light and warmth like the sun.

    The conclusion can only be this: we must never pour cold water on the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people; but for the bourgeois "warm sentimentality," we might as well pour some cold water to wake up those comrades who are somewhat dazed by being entangled in "warm sentimentality."

    热情温情冷水
    龚同文
    在我们这个暂时还是贫穷和落后的国家里，最可贵的就是六亿五千万人民要求迅速改变这种贫穷和落后面貌的强烈愿望所产生出来的革命热情。我们党的任务就是要善于珍惜和发扬群众的革命热情。党的社会主义建设总路线，正是大大地激发了群众的这种革命热情，才造成了去年以来的跃进形势。哪里有党的领导，哪里坚持贯彻了总路线，哪里就是热气腾腾。
    可是，在我们党内，有一小撮右倾机会主义分子，在热气腾腾的革命斗争面前，一点热气也没有。他们的热气到哪里去了？也许早就在他们自己和国内外反动派所制造的“冷空气”当中变成“冷水”了吧，他们不正是把这种“冷水”朝着群众火一样的革命热情泼过去么？
    水火不相容，我们决不允许右倾机会主义分子往群众的革命热情上泼冷水！
    这是不久以前的事情：湖北省武汉市有一小撮右倾机会主义分子在制造“冷空气”，一些在“冷空气”里“感冒”了的人，跟在右倾机会主义分子的后面，叫喊“困难”。在当时，他们怎能料得到会提前超额完成国家下达的年度计划呢？而一经开展反对右倾机会主义的斗争，武汉市就热气腾腾，全市1959年工业总产值，已经在11月8日提前五十三天超额完成了国家下达的年度计划。看吧，最可贵的不是群众的革命热情是什么！右倾机会主义不是必须彻底反掉么！
    把反对右倾机会主义的斗争进行到底，最主要的是为了保护和发扬群众的革命热情，同时也是为了把陷在资产阶级个人主义泥坑里而不能自拔的右倾机会主义分子拉出来。医生不害怕病人的传染，也不顾虑病人怕痒怕疼，而敢于认真地给病人打针、开刀，目的是要消灭病人所感染的病菌，使病人健康起来。同样地，我们共产党人一方面要坚决清除危害党和人民的右倾机会主义“病菌”，另一方面也不能睁眼看着自己的同志掉在泥坑里而不拉他一把。尽管右倾机会主义分子对我们的事业泼冷水，而我们对右倾机会主义分子仍然是充满着同志式的热情。要做到这一点，就必须遵循“团结——批评——团结”的方针，采取摆事实、讲道理的方法，对犯了右倾机会主义错误的同志，进行严肃认真的批判和教育。
    但正在这个时候，有一种介乎“热”和“冷”之间的东西出来了，这就是某些同志所欣赏的“温情主义”。他们看到自己的同志陷在泥坑里，不仅不伸手拉他，而且还对正在使劲拉他的同志们唠叨不休：“不要过火了”，“适可而止吧”。说起来多么好听，仔细量一量，这种“情”不仅一点儿“温”也没有，简直是冷酷无情！
    因为犯错误的人，是自己的老上级、老同事、老部下、老朋友，或者是自己的什么“亲人”，就来一点“温情”主义，吞吞吐吐地说什么“斗争吗？不可‘不’，也不可‘太’……”“太”什么？太过火了吗？难道让他老是陷在泥坑里就是“适可而止”？难道再拉他一把就算“过火”？温情主义者，看你多么狠心！当你的老上级、老同事、老部下、老朋友或者是什么“亲人”给群众泼冷水的时候，你作何感想？你的“温情”哪里去了？难道你对右倾机会主义分子的“情”，比对人民群众的“情”还要“温”一些吗？如果真是这样，那可真危险呀！
    看来，在反右倾机会主义这样的政治斗争中，一星半点的温情主义也来不得。对于我们来说，最可贵的是热情，是真正的革命热情。我们应当以这种革命热情去保护群众的革命热情，也应当以这种革命热情去挽救那些犯了右倾机会主义错误的同志。我们的党从来是充满革命热情的。人民群众把我们的党比做太阳，就是因为她像太阳一样给人们以光明和温暖。
    结论只能是这样：对于广大人民群众的革命热情决不能泼冷水；而对于资产阶级的什么“温情”之类，不妨泼点冷水，让那些被“温情”纠缠得有些昏迷的同志清醒过来。
