"Escape, Defend, Attack" – this is the trilogy of the people in desert areas in different historical periods.

For thousands of years, the people in the desert areas were attacked by both the reactionary ruling class and the desert, struggling on the edge of hunger and death, eventually ending up fleeing in all directions. After the liberation in 1949, under the leadership of the Party, the people in the desert areas began to declare war on the desert. However, individual farmers and agricultural cooperatives were ultimately weak, and could only plant "road protection forests" by the roadside and "field protection forests" by the fields, playing a defensive role! In 1958, the horn of the Great Leap Forward shook every corner of the motherland. The people of the former Niujialiang Township in Yulin County, Shaanxi Province, with unprecedented originality, decided to divert water from Honghualiang through the vast desert to Hailiutan, building a forty-li-long canal. This was the prelude to attacking the desert.

According to the principle of more labor for more benefit, the Hailiutan Advanced Cooperative should contribute more labor; however, this cooperative did not have that much labor, and the farmers were very anxious. The advanced cooperatives below Hailiutan, because of the lack of land, needed to use water to wash away the sand and open up fields (using water to level sand dunes into flat land, which can be used as farmland or pasture). They had labor, but because they were not in the benefited area, they could not use their strength. Disputes over labor were constant, and there were even more problems with materials, labor organization, unified planning, and unified command. At this time, the farmers deeply felt that various contradictions hindered the progress of the canal construction project; but with the spirit of cooperation and strong fighting spirit, the masses finally built this canal. With water, the masses in Hailiutan happily planted rice. The farmers in the nearby areas saw the water flowing in the desert, washing out large areas of sandy land, creating many rice fields and fish ponds. Thus, everyone's vision went beyond the boundaries of the cooperatives and townships, hoping to turn the yellow sand and rivers in this area into wealth. People asked to extend the canal and expand the construction plan so that the advanced cooperatives in the hundred-li-long desert area could benefit. To realize this desire, people were eager to break through the original relations of production and merge the twelve advanced cooperatives into two large cooperatives. At this time, the masses only knew that merging into large cooperatives had many benefits. However, after a few months, Chairman Mao proposed "People's Communes are Good," and cheers resounded through the desert sky, and the people's communes came into being.

The establishment of the people's commune organized a powerful force to attack the desert. People were no longer satisfied with getting more water, opening up more sandy fields, but wanted to "conquer the Mu Us Desert!" They decided to extend the Yudong Canal by another hundred li, introducing the canal into the hinterland of the desert. Because the commune unified planning, centralized, and effectively organized the manpower and material resources of each production brigade, the difference was clear: before the establishment of the commune, the Yudong Canal took nearly seven months to build only forty li; but after the establishment of the people's commune, it took two months to build one hundred li of canals and two large reservoirs. After thousands of hardships, this desert canal – the Yudong Canal – coiled like a long dragon, and the water flowed obediently into the vast desert. When the masses dozens of miles away heard that the canal was completed and the water came, they cheered wildly.

Since the water of the Yudong Canal entered the desert, although the time has been less than a year, the desert world has undergone great changes. Around the canal, nearly a thousand small lakes have appeared in the sand bays, like bunches of grapes, one after another, extending into the distance. Sand dunes are like isolated islands besieged in the center of the small lakes. Some sand dunes have been completely paralyzed and submerged in the lake. The wind, which had always colluded with the sand, no longer dared to be fierce where there was water. The vast desert, where no grass grew in the past, has also grown various grasses and naturally grown forests. With water in the large sand bays, a large number of fish can be raised (more than twenty lakes have more than 400,000 fish). Cormorants and bean geese fly in the sky above the lakes, and swans also come here to roost.

The desert is afraid of water, and people have now found this trick. People make full use of the water from the Yudong Canal to "divert water to wash away the sand" in the vast desert, opening up fields. Before communization, although the masses of the former Niujialiang Township also "diverted water to wash away the sand," they could only do it on a small scale due to the small water source. Now, with the desert canal and many large canals, with one small lake and one large reservoir, the desert can be turned into fertile land on a large scale. This spring, the Niujialiang Commune has used the method of "diverting water to wash away the sand" to turn 3,300 mu of desert into flat fields; in the fall, it launched a large-scale work of turning the desert into fertile land. In the Hailiutan Production Brigade, from the start of construction in early September to early October, nearly 1,000 mu of fields have been washed out. Yubojian, which belongs to the Niujialiang Commune, used to be a piece of shifting sand. After communization, the water of the Yudong Canal was used to "divert water to wash away the sand," turning more than 400 mu of shifting sand into fertile land. The millet and broomcorn millet here are more than half a person tall, and there is a high-yield cornfield of eight mu, with an average yield of 600 jin per mu; there are also large areas of vegetables and melons, which are very exciting to see. What rich rewards the desert brings to the laborers!

Building the Yudong Canal has made the broad masses more aware of their own strength, solved many technical problems, and produced a large number of local experts. The Niujialiang Commune, in cooperation with another commune, adopted the method of "building dams with sand" to build the Baihe Reservoir with a storage capacity of more than 40 million cubic meters, ensuring that 12,000 mu of farmland downstream is free from disasters, and at the same time, it can irrigate 150,000 mu of farmland and sandy land. Now, on the land of the Niujialiang People's Commune, trees have become forests, canals crisscross, rice fields are connected; flocks of sheep graze on the flat grasslands; and fish jump in the grape-bunch-like lakes of various sizes in the desert. The commune members sing: "Cattle and sheep run all over the beach, fish are raised in the sandy sea, a little Jiangnan on the frontier, and the rice is fragrant in August."

The Niujialiang People's Commune is just one of the many advanced communes in the Yulin Prefecture. Looking at the situation of the entire Yulin Prefecture is even more encouraging. The desert accounts for 33.1% of the total land area of Yulin Prefecture. After ten years of hard work, the desert that has been greened in the entire prefecture accounts for 25% of the total desert area, basically fixing the shifting sand on the edge of the large desert, protecting the houses, farmland, and pasture in the desert area. However, launching a full-scale attack on the desert was only after the Great Leap Forward and communization last year. Last year, the afforestation area was 5.24 million mu, which is equal to three times the total afforestation since liberation; this year, in the first spring after communization, the entire prefecture afforested more than 2.4 million mu, an increase of 33% compared with the same period last year. This year, many expeditions went deep into the hinterland of the large desert, sowing grass seeds and planting saplings for the first time in places rarely visited by people. Before liberation, the entire prefecture had more than 127,000 mu of irrigated land. From 1950 to 1958, a total of more than 407,000 mu of irrigated land were built; and from the Great Leap Forward in 1958 to the first half of 1959, more than 697,000 mu of irrigated land were built, which is more than 290,000 mu more than the total of irrigated land built in the past eight years. The people's communes in the desert areas, with the help of the state, have organized a large professional team for water conservancy construction, building many reservoirs and large canals in the desert areas, which can turn a larger area of desert into fertile land.

For 150 years, the desert along the Great Wall flowed southward like a flood for 140 li, arbitrarily engulfing everything. However, without machinery and without much investment, the people of Yulin Prefecture, under the leadership of the Party, relying on their own labor and the strength of the people's communes, began to control it, tame it, and transform it. They are building a beautiful and picturesque world of happiness out of the vast yellow sand, which for so many years has been associated with desolation, drought, and death.

### 沙漠中的革命——榆林县牛家梁公社是怎样战胜沙漠的

    沙漠中的革命
    ——榆林县牛家梁公社是怎样战胜沙漠的
    “逃、防、攻”，这是沙漠地区人民在不同历史时期的三部曲。
    几千年来，沙区人民被反动统治阶级和沙漠夹攻，在饥饿死亡的边沿上挣扎，最后只落得逃亡四方。1949年解放后，沙区人民在党的领导下，开始向沙漠宣战。但是，个体农民和农业合作社，毕竟力量单薄，也只能在路边栽“护路林”、在田边栽“护田林”，起着一些防御的作用罢了！1958年，大跃进的号角震动了祖国各个角落，陕西榆林县原牛家梁乡的人民群众，以前无古人的独创精神，决定从红花梁引水，通过大沙漠到达海流滩，修一条四十华里长的大渠道。这就是向沙漠进攻的序曲。
    根据多受益多出劳力的原则，海流滩高级社应该多出些劳力；但是这个社没有那么多的劳力，农民们非常焦急。而海流滩下边的几个高级社，因为地缺，很需要用水冲沙开田（利用水力削平沙丘，变成平坦的土地，可作农田或牧地），他们也有劳力，但因为不是受益区，有劲使不上。为了劳力问题整天闹纠纷，至于材料、劳动组织、统一规划和统一指挥方面，问题更多。这时候，农民们深感种种矛盾妨碍修渠工程的进展；而凭着协作精神与旺盛的斗志，群众终于把这条渠修成了。有了水，海流滩的群众就欢天喜地的种上了稻子。附近地区的农民看到了沙漠中水流滚滚，冲出大片沙地，造成许多稻田和鱼池，于是大伙儿的眼光便越出社界、乡界，很希望把这一带的黄沙和大小河流都变成财富。人们纷纷要求延长渠道，扩大兴修计划，使百余里沙区的高级社都能受益。为了实现这种要求，人们迫不及待地要求突破原有的生产关系，把十二个高级社合并为两个大社。这时候群众只知道并大社好处多。可是过了几个月，毛主席提出了“人民公社好”，于是欢呼声响彻沙漠上空，人民公社就应运而生了。
  人民公社的成立，为向沙漠进攻组织了强大的力量。人们已经不满足于多弄点水地，多开些沙田，而是要“征服毛乌素大沙漠”！他们决定把榆东渠先延长一百华里，把渠道引入沙漠腹地去。由于公社统一规划，集中而有效地组织各个生产大队的人力物力，从而就显出这样的差别来：公社成立前，榆东渠修了将近七个月，只修了四十华里；而人民公社成立后，用两个月时间，便修了一百华里渠道和两个大水库。经过千辛万苦，这条沙漠运河——榆东渠，像长龙一样弯弯曲曲地盘伏着，水驯服地流进了大沙漠。几十里以外的群众听到渠成水来的时候，欢呼若狂。
    榆东渠的水进入沙漠以来，虽然时间不到一年，但沙漠世界已经发生了很大的变化。渠道周围的沙湾里，出现了近千个小海子，像葡萄串一样，一个接连一个，伸向远方。一个个沙丘像孤岛似的被围困在小海子的中心。有的沙丘已经完全瘫痪，没落在湖里了。一向和沙子狼狈为奸的风，在有水的地方也不再逞凶了。过去寸草不生的大沙漠，也长起了各种绿草和自生林。大沙湾里有了水，便可以大量养鱼（已有二十多个海子养鱼四十多万尾）。鱼鹰、黄雁在湖泊上空飞翔，天鹅也到这里来栖居了。
    沙漠怕水，人们现在找到了这个窍门。人们充分利用榆东渠的水，在广阔的沙漠中“引水冲沙”，开辟田地。公社化以前，原牛家梁乡的群众虽然也曾“引水冲沙”，但因水源小，只能小规模地进行。现在有了沙漠运河和许多大渠道，有了一个又一个小海子和大水库，这就能大规模地把沙漠变成良田。今春，牛家梁公社已经用“引水冲沙”的办法，把三千三百亩沙漠变为平坦的田地；秋季，又展开了大规模变沙漠为良田的工作。在海流滩生产大队，从9月初开工到10月初，已经冲出近千亩田地。牛家梁公社所属的榆泊涧，过去是一片流沙。公社化以后，用榆东渠的水“引水冲沙”，把四百多亩流沙变成良田。这里的谷子、糜子长了半人多高，有一片八亩地的玉米丰产田，平均每亩可打六百斤；这里还有大片的菜蔬和瓜类，看了使人十分兴奋。沙漠给劳动者带来多么丰厚的报酬啊！
    修榆东渠，使广大群众更加认识了自己的力量，解决了许多技术方面的问题，出现了大批土专家。牛家梁公社协同另一个公社采取“以沙筑坝”的办法，建成了蓄水四千多万立方的白河水库，保证了下游一万二千亩农田免于灾害，同时可以灌溉十五万亩农田和沙地。现在，牛家梁人民公社的土地上，树木成林，水渠纵横，稻田相连；平坦的草地上，漫过羊群；在沙漠中的葡萄串似的大小湖泊里，鱼在跳跃。社员们唱道：“牛羊满滩跑，沙海把鱼养，塞上小江南，八月稻谷香。”
    牛家梁人民公社只是榆林专区许多先进公社当中的一个，看看整个榆林专区的情况，就更加鼓舞人心。沙漠占榆林专区土地总面积的33.1％，经过十年奋战，全专区绿化了的沙漠，占沙漠总面积25％，基本上固定了大沙漠边沿上的流沙，保护了沙区的房屋、农田和牧地。但是，向沙漠开展全面进攻，这还是在去年大跃进和公社化以后的事。去年造林面积五百二十四万亩，等于解放以来造林总和的三倍；今年，公社化后的第一个春季，全专区造林二百四十余万亩，比去年同时期增加33％。今年，许多远征队深入大沙漠腹地，在人迹罕到的地方，第一次播下草种，栽下树苗。解放前全专区共有水地十二万七千多亩，从1950年到1958年共修水地四十万七千多亩；而从1958年大跃进到1959年上半年，便修出水地六十九万七千多亩，比过去八年来兴修水地的总和还多二十九万亩。沙漠地区的人民公社在国家帮助下，组织了庞大的兴修水利的专业队伍，在沙漠地区修许多水库和大渠，可使更大面积的沙漠变成良田。
    一百五十年来，长城沿线的沙漠像洪水似的向南流动了一百四十华里，任意吞没一切。但是，没有机械，不用多少投资，榆林专区的人民在党的领导下，依靠自己的劳动和人民公社的力量，开始控制它，驯服它，改造它。他们正在把多少年来和荒凉、干旱及死亡联系在一起的漠漠黄沙，缔造为一个美丽如画的幸福世界。　　（摘自中共陕西省委的调查报告）（附图片）
