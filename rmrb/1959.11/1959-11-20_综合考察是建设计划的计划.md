Comprehensive Investigation is a Plan for Construction Plans
Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Director of the Comprehensive Survey Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

Finding Scientific Basis for the Formulation of National Economic Plans

China has a vast territory with superior natural conditions and abundant natural resources. However, the semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China left us with extremely scarce scientific data. More than 60% of the country's total area is still practically a blank in terms of scientific knowledge. After liberation, in order to ensure that these superior conditions and abundant resources can meet the requirements of national economic construction and be fully utilized and rationally developed, the state must conduct a series of professional and comprehensive surveys and research on areas that need to be developed. This is to fully grasp the changing laws of natural conditions, the distribution of natural resources, and the historical evolution of socio-economic factors, in order to propose the direction of utilization and development, the prospects for national economic development, and a rational allocation plan for industry and agriculture, as a scientific basis for formulating national economic plans.

Comprehensive investigation is a scientific endeavor carried out to achieve the above objectives. Based on the tasks set by the state and the characteristics of geographic resources, it organizes various necessary disciplines, including geology, water energy, geography, soil, plants, and aspects of industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, transportation, and economics. It involves not only disciplines in natural sciences but also disciplines in social sciences. Its perspective on issues differs from that of a single discipline, profession, or department. It must analyze and consider from various angles, and compare and demonstrate from multiple perspectives to propose various plans for selection and adoption. Its working method combines points and surfaces, using points to lead the surfaces. In the investigation of a region, it seizes key major issues for in-depth research, with solving these problems as the center, considering a comprehensive layout. The final report submitted after comprehensive investigation is a suggestive long-term plan, provided to the national planning department as a reference when formulating national economic plans. Therefore, some people describe it as a "plan of plans," playing the role of a "searchlight" for planning.

Although the general direction of comprehensive investigation work should focus on long-term goals and not simply start from solving immediate specific problems, in China's specific circumstances, long-term prospects and current production and construction cannot be completely separated. Current major construction plans must be combined with long-term prospects, and many aspects of long-term planning need to be started now. At the same time, China's economic construction plans and planning are formulated by combining unified leadership from the central government and decentralized management at the local level, and national tasks and local tasks are directly related to each other. Therefore, China's comprehensive investigation should also actively consider local tasks related to national prospects in the process of work. In addition, some countries' major work in transforming nature is also an important part of the comprehensive investigation.

Investigation Results of Ten Investigation Teams

In recent years, the investigation teams directly organized by the Comprehensive Investigation Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences include the following ten:

I. Yellow River Middle Reaches Soil and Water Conservation Comprehensive Investigation Team. The task is to fundamentally control the Yellow River's water disasters and develop Yellow River water conservancy. To improve agricultural production in mountainous areas and reduce sediment deposition in the Sanmenxia Reservoir, scientific investigation and research are being carried out on the issue of soil erosion in the Loess Plateau region. Work began in 1953 and the investigation work ended in 1958. This team conducted investigations on an area of 350,000 square kilometers in the Loess Plateau region of the middle reaches of the Yellow River. It formulated natural zoning, agricultural zoning, economic zoning, and rational utilization zoning for soil and water conservation land, providing a scientific basis for the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry and the rational allocation of soil and water conservation measures. At the same time, it compiled a "Soil and Water Conservation Handbook" that can be used by general cadres and people's communes in promotion work. In addition, according to the different types of soil erosion in different regions, combined with the production needs of the masses, it has successively carried out in-depth investigation and research in eleven small watersheds, and formulated comprehensive measures configuration plans for soil and water conservation and rational land utilization respectively.

II. Heilongjiang River Basin Comprehensive Investigation Team. This is a joint effort between China and the Soviet Union. The task is to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the natural resources and natural conditions of the Heilongjiang River Basin, such as water energy, water conservancy, geology, minerals, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, and economic conditions, and to propose a long-term development plan. Work began in 1956, fieldwork ended in 1959, and a development plan for the investigation area will be made in 1960. This team not only ascertained the flow of the middle and upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River Basin's water energy and water conservancy resources, but also conducted a relatively detailed survey of the dam sites, geology, and hydrology for cascade development in the middle and upper reaches, and conducted detailed geological drilling work and comparative scheme research on the dam sites where the first phase of the project may be constructed. In 1959, a technical and economic design report on power station development will be submitted as a basis for the country to decide on the power development plan for the Heilongjiang River Basin. In addition, route reconnaissance of geology and mineral deposits in areas such as the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains and the Ussuri River was conducted, and 1:500,000 geological maps and geotectonic maps of the above-mentioned areas were drawn, and iron, manganese, copper, lead, zinc, antimony, tungsten, fluorite, mercury, petroleum, oil shale and other mineral deposits and mineralization points were found. Other aspects, such as forest, soil, plant, fishery and other resources, as well as transportation and social economy, have also been understood and investigated. A comprehensive development plan for the Heilongjiang River Basin will be prepared after the completion of the fieldwork in 1959, providing a basis for the national economic construction departments and planning departments to formulate plans.

III. Xinjiang Comprehensive Investigation Team. The task is to study the rational utilization of natural conditions and natural resources, centered on agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy, as well as the allocation of productive forces. Work began in 1956, and the main fieldwork is scheduled to come to an end in 1959, with a comprehensive scientific summary to be conducted in 1960.

In the past three years of investigation, this team proposed opinions on the prospects for agricultural production allocation, such as the proportion of cotton and grain in the Manas River area of ​​northern Xinjiang, which has been adopted by local production departments. Comprehensive development suggestions for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy were put forward for the Turpan area of ​​southern Xinjiang, as an important reference for planning. The Kaidu River diversion issue in the Yanqi area is one of the key issues for the agricultural development of the Yanqi (less land and more water) and Korla (more land and less water) areas. Because the river flows into Bosten Lake, where evaporation loss is extremely large, with an annual evaporation loss of 1 billion to 1.6 billion cubic meters, it is necessary to divert it directly through the Peacock River to areas such as Korla and Yuli for irrigation. The team also conducted investigations on the Ertix River, Ulungur River, Manas River, and Ili River in northern Xinjiang, as well as the Peacock River and Tarim River in southern Xinjiang, made new estimates of water conservancy resources, and conducted extensive investigations and research on groundwater conditions. Abundant data has been collected on hydrology, geology, soil, plants, agriculture, and animal husbandry in the arid areas of Xinjiang.

IV. Yunnan Tropical Biological Resources Comprehensive Investigation Team. The task is to expand from the lac investigation to the comprehensive development and utilization of tropical and subtropical biological resources in Yunnan. Investigation began in 1955 and is expected to end in 1962. This team conducted a comprehensive investigation of lac. Lac is a unique product of Yunnan. Lac was collected on about 120 species of host plants in 33 counties, and the species, production areas, hosts, and natural enemies of the lac insects were identified. In addition, positioning experimental research was carried out, technical personnel were trained, and the masses were guided in production and promotion. The team combined with the province's plant resource survey and conducted key investigations in the Xishuangbanna area of ​​Yunnan, mastering a large amount of data. There are nearly 30,000 species of higher plants in China, and Yunnan alone accounts for about 48% of the country. In recent years, more than 1,000 species of resource plants have been investigated. Among them, there are many species with greater economic value and development prospects.

V. South China Tropical Biological Resources Comprehensive Investigation Team. The task is to conduct investigations and research on the comprehensive development and utilization of tropical and subtropical biological resources in Guangdong, Guangxi, and southern Fujian, and pay special attention to coordinating with the planting of tropical economic crops such as rubber and coffee. Work began in 1952 and is expected to end in 1962. The climate in South China has the characteristics of tropical, subtropical, and temperate zones, and the biological resources are extremely rich. Especially tropical biological resources occupy an important position in the socialist camp. In 1952, more than 1,000 scientific and technical personnel responded to the government's call and conducted extensive investigations of tropical resource plants in Hainan Island and western Guangdong, put forward specific opinions on the selection of rubber afforestation land, the establishment of shelterbelts and sprouting belts; they learned about the impact of climate factors on plants, as well as the physiological effects of cold waves on plants, and put forward various measures for cold protection and suggestions for improving fertilization methods. In 1958, the South China Team also clarified the natural conditions of the area during the investigation of the Shiwandashan area of ​​Guangxi, and formulated the natural zoning of the 19 counties and the economic zoning of the six counties in the area. A large area of rubber afforestation land was found in the area, and 537 species of plants and 130 species of animals with economic value were found. It has been proposed that special attention should be paid to these species.

VI. Soil Survey Team. The task is to cooperate with the needs of river basin planning, conduct soil surveys in the Yellow River and Yangtze River irrigation areas, and carry out certain positioning experiments. Work began in 1956 and is still ongoing. The Soil Survey Team conducted extensive irrigation area surveys in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The surveyed area is 276,000 square kilometers in the Yellow River Basin and 189,000 square kilometers in the Yangtze River Basin, and 1:200,000 and 1:100,000 soil maps have been prepared respectively, which not only meets the needs of the Yellow River and Yangtze River Basin planning, but also directly helps some people's communes carry out soil improvement planning. In North China, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia and other places, research on soil salinization was carried out in combination with groundwater, clarifying various types of salinization and putting forward suggestions for preventing salinization.

VII. Salt Lake Scientific Investigation Team. The task is to investigate the salt lake resources in the Qaidam Basin and study comprehensive development and utilization. Work began in 1957 and is still ongoing. The Qaidam Salt Lake Team not only put forward opinions on the salt lake conditions and the development of certain resources, but also directly helped local areas solve technical problems related to the local production of urgently needed potash fertilizer. From 1957 to 1958, the Salt Lake Team conducted investigations in this area, and initially grasped various resource materials such as the distribution and composition of salt resources, indicating that this basin not only has huge reserves of salt needed for basic chemical industry raw materials, but also is rich in chemical raw materials urgently needed in industry and various new technologies and potash highly needed in agricultural production. Various salts are also deposited in the strata near the salt lake. Continued in-depth research may discover more resources. Research on comprehensive development and utilization plans and technological processes for the important resources found has also begun.

VIII. Qinghai-Gansu Comprehensive Investigation Team. The task is to investigate the industrial and agricultural resources of the Qinghai-Gansu region, and study comprehensive development, utilization, and the allocation of productive forces. Work began in 1958 and is expected to end in 1961. Although the Qinghai-Gansu Team only started working last year, it has provided direct assistance to the dam site and part of the channel engineering geology of the Yintao Project, and put forward preliminary opinions on the comprehensive allocation of productive forces in the Hexi Corridor. It also put forward planning opinions on the rational utilization of water and soil resources in the Beida River Basin.

IX. Desert Control Team. The task is to carry out scientific investigation and experimental research on desert transformation and utilization based on the desert control planning program formulated at the Northwest Six Provinces (Regions) Desert Control Planning Conference in October 1958. It began to be formed in 1959. Its predecessor, the Sand Fixation Team, was initially part of the Yellow River Middle Reaches Soil and Water Conservation Investigation Team. In the past three years, it has conducted preliminary investigations on the deserts of Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Gansu and other provinces and regions, providing some scientific data for future desert control work.

X. Western Region South-to-North Water Diversion Comprehensive Investigation Team. The task is to conduct a comprehensive investigation of water diversion routes and the comprehensive development and utilization of resources in the region based on the decision of the Western Region South-to-North Water Diversion Investigation and Planning Conference jointly convened by the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in February 1959. It began to be formed in 1959.

The scope of investigation of the above ten investigation teams almost covers the entire country, most of which are areas with a lack of scientific data, inconvenient transportation, and difficult supply.

Several New Discoveries from Comprehensive Investigation

Through investigation work, there have also been many new discoveries regarding natural conditions, overturning certain old concepts, and even obtaining new clues and approaches to solving natural laws, thereby helping to improve science.

In the past, soil scientists simply referred to the soils of the North China Plain as "alluvial soils," which could only reflect the geological deposition process and could not reflect the characteristics of agricultural production and the occurrence and evolution of soils. In their investigation, they used the theory of soil genesis, clarified the transition and evolution of various soils, and divided the soil classes and varieties in detail. In the past, it was not clear how the northern subtropical region and the warm temperate soil (brown soil) transitioned. Through investigation work, it is known that the northern subtropical region is mainly yellow-brown soil (also known as yellow-brown soil), distributed in the area north of the Yangtze River, the Tangbai River Valley and the area north of the Han River. There are also further views on the occurrence and evolution of paddy soils in the south. In the soil surveys of Northeast, Qinghai, Gansu and Xinjiang, a system of soil classification was initially drafted, explaining the distribution and characteristics of soil types. Xinjiang affirmed that gray-brown desert soil is the zonal soil of northern Xinjiang.

Geologists in the Heilongjiang River Basin comprehensively analyzed the sedimentary thickness and lithofacies changes, folding and faulting, magmatic activity, metamorphism, and mineral distribution characteristics, and initially understood the geological genesis history of this region, dividing the geotectonic structure of this region into six zones, pointing out the mineral prospects of the corresponding regions; the discovery of a large amount of potash salt deposits in the Qaidam Basin illustrates the relationship between inland lakes and potash salt deposits; the discovery of a relatively large amount of primary siderite in the Permian strata of Guangxi has opened up new directions for future mineral exploration.

Geomorphologists in Yunnan studied the relationship between the enrichment and micro-geomorphic conditions of weathering crust-type nickel deposits. The research on the geomorphology of Yunnan in the past only recognized it from the perspective of morphology, but ignored the development of geomorphology. After investigation, especially on the plateau surface of the Dadugang (south of Simao) at an altitude of 1,350 meters, the discovery of undoubted fluvial facies deposits strongly proves that the Yunnan Plateau was formed by long-term erosion in the past, and rose to its current height during the crustal movement at the end of the Tertiary and the beginning of the Quaternary. In the investigations of the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Taklamakan deserts, it was confirmed that the origin of sand in the dunes comes from the nearby lacustrine alluvial or alluvial plains, rather than from afar.

Climatologists investigated the Northeast, Xinjiang, and South China regions, and exchanged opinions with soil scientists and geobotanists, and gained a further understanding of the dividing line between tropical, subtropical, temperate, and cold temperate zones in China. It is believed that the indicators of subtropical zone in China are suitable for accumulated temperature of 4500-8000℃, the coldest month temperature of 2-16℃, and frost-free period from 240-365 days. According to this indicator, the northern boundary of China's subtropical zone is roughly close to 34° north latitude, that is, the Huaihe-Qinling-Bailongjiang line to 104° east longitude. This line belongs to the alpine climate zone further west. This roughly corresponds to the northern boundary of two crops a year in agricultural production. Although some areas in Xinjiang have an annual accumulated temperature of more than 5,000°C (such as Hotan and Turpan) or can also plant annual subtropical crops such as cotton in summer, perennial subtropical plants cannot naturally overwinter in the open field due to the low winter temperature, often reaching minus ten degrees Celsius, so they should not be included in the subtropical zone. Opinions on the division of tropical and subtropical zones were also put forward in the investigation in Guangxi.

Botanists proved that the Junggar Basin in northern Xinjiang is a transition zone between the Turkestan Desert and the Central Asian Desert, and proposed that its western boundary line is located on the boundary mountains in the western part of the Junggar Basin. New insights have also been put forward on the origin of the flora of Yunnan.

China's scientific strength is still relatively weak, and lacks experience. Comprehensive investigation work is even more so. However, under the strong leadership of the Party and the selfless help of Soviet experts, great achievements have been made. In the future, with the high-speed development of socialist construction, even greater achievements will be made.

    综合考察是建设计划的计划
    中国科学院副院长　中国科学院综合考察委员会主任　竺可桢
    为编制国民经济计划找科学依据
    我国幅员广阔，有着优越的自然条件和丰富的自然资源，但是半殖民地半封建的旧中国遗留给我们的有关科学资料却极为贫乏。占全国总面积60％以上的地区，在科学上几乎还是一个空白地区。解放后，国家为了使这些优越的条件和富饶的资源能够适合国家经济建设的要求，得到充分的利用和合理的开发，就必须对需要开发的地区进行一系列专业的和综合的调查研究工作，以便在充分掌握自然条件的变化规律、自然资源的分布情况和社会经济的历史演变过程等资料的基础上，提出利用和开发的方向、国民经济的发展远景以及工农业合理配置的方案，作为编制国民经济计划的科学依据。
    综合考察是为了达到上述目的而进行的一种科学工作。它根据国家提出的任务和地理资源的特点，组织各种必要的学科，其中如地质、水能、地理、土壤、植物和工、农、林、牧、交通、经济等等方面的学科共同参加工作，其中不但要有自然科学方面的学科，也要有社会科学方面的学科。它所考虑问题的着眼点与某一学科、某一专业或某一部门不同，它必须从各个角度分析、考虑，多方面比较论证，提出多种方案，以便选择取舍。它的工作方法是点面结合，以点带面，在一个地区的考察中，抓住关键性的重大的问题进行深入研究，以解决这些问题为中心，考虑全面布局。经过综合考察最后提出的报告是建议性的远景方案，供国家计划部门编制国民经济计划时作参考。因此有人形容它是“计划的计划”，对于计划起着“探照灯的作用”。
    综合考察工作的总方向虽然应当着重于长远目标而不应当单纯从解决眼前的具体问题出发，但是在我国的具体情况下，不能把远景和当前生产建设截然分开，当前的重大建设计划要与远景的展望相结合，而远景的规划有许多方面又需要现在即着手进行。同时我国经济建设的计划和规划是由中央统一领导和地方分权管理相结合而制定的，国家任务与地方任务二者直接互相关联着。因此我国的综合考察在工作过程中对于与国家远景有关的地方任务也应该积极考虑。此外某些国家的重大的改造自然的工作也是综合考察的重要工作内容。
    十个考察队的考察成果
    几年来由中国科学院综合考察委员会直接组织的考察队前后共计有以下十个：
    一、黄河中游水土保持综合考察队。任务是根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利，为提高山区农业生产并减轻三门峡水库的泥沙淤积，对于黄土高原地区的水土流失问题，进行科学调查研究工作。1953年开始工作，已在1958年结束调查工作。这个队在黄河中游黄土高原地区共三十五万平方公里的土地面积上进行了考察。制定了自然区划、农业区划、经济区划、水土保持土地合理利用等区划，提供了农林牧综合开发和水土保持措施合理配置的科学依据。同时编制了在推广工作中一般干部和人民公社能使用的“水土保持手册”。此外还根据不同区域的水土流失类型，结合群众的生产需要先后进行了十一个小流域的重点深入调查研究，并分别制订了水土保持土地合理利用综合措施配置规划。
    二、黑龙江流域综合考察队。这是中苏两国合作组成的。任务是进行黑龙江流域的水能、水利、地质、矿产、农、林、牧、渔等自然资源和自然条件、经济情况的综合考察并提出开发远景方案。1956年开始工作，1959年结束野外工作，1960年做出考察地区的开发方案。这个队对黑龙江流域的水能水利资源，不仅查明了中上游的流量，而且对中上游梯级开发坝址、地质、水文作了比较详细的勘察，并对第一期工程可能施工的坝址，进行了详细的地质钻探工作和比较方案的研究。1959年度将提出一个电站开发的技术经济设计报告，以供国家在决定黑龙江流域电力开发计划时作依据。此外，还对大小兴安岭和乌苏里江等地区的地质矿藏进行路线普查，绘制了上述地区的五十万分之一的地质图和大地构造图，找出铁、锰、铜、铅、锌、锑、钨、萤石、汞、石油、油页岩等矿床和矿化点。其他如森林、土壤、植物、渔业等资源以及交通运输和社会经济等各个方面，也进行了解和考察，将在1959年野外工作结束后编写关于黑龙江流域的全面的综合开发远景方案，提供国家经济建设部门和计划部门作为制定计划的依据。
    三、新疆综合考察队。任务是以农、林、牧、水利为中心的自然条件和自然资源合理利用以及生产力配置的研究。1956年开始工作，主要的野外考察工作预定在1959年告一段落，1960年进行全面的科学总结。
    这个队在过去三年的考察中，对北疆玛纳斯河地区提出棉粮比重等农业生产配置远景的意见，已为当地生产部门采纳。对南疆吐鲁番地区提出农、林、牧、水利的综合开发建议，作为规划的重要参考。焉耆地区开都河改道问题，为焉耆（地少水多）、库尔勒（地多水少）地区农业发展的关键性问题之一。由于该河流入博斯腾湖蒸发损失极大，每年蒸发损耗共达十到十六亿公方之多，需要使其改道直接经过孔雀河流到库尔勒、尉犁等地区，作为灌溉之用。该队并进行了北疆额尔齐斯河、乌伦古河、玛纳斯河、伊犁河以及南疆的孔雀河、塔里木河等河的调查，对水利资源作了新的估计，并对地下水的情况进行了广泛的调查和研究。对于新疆干旱地区的水文地质、土壤、植物、农牧等方面都掌握了丰富的资料。
    四、云南热带生物资源综合考察队。任务是在紫胶考察的基础上扩大为云南热带亚热带生物资源的综合开发和利用。1955年开始进行考察，预期1962年可告结束。这个队对于紫胶进行了全面的调查。紫胶是云南特有的产物。在三十三个县约一百二十种寄主植物上采集到紫胶，查明了胶蚧科的种类、产区、寄主、天敌，而且还进行了定位试验研究，培训技术力量，指导群众生产和推广。该队与全省的植物资源普查相结合，在云南西双版纳区做了重点调查，掌握了大量的资料。我国高等植物种类将近三万种，而云南一地就占全国的48％左右。数年来调查了一千多种资源植物。其中经济价值较大，有发展前途的种类甚多。
    五、华南热带生物资源综合考察队。任务是在广东、广西、闽南地区进行热带和亚热带生物资源的综合开发和利用的考察和研究，并特别注意配合橡胶和咖啡等热带经济作物的种植。1952年开始工作，预期1962年可告结束。华南地区气候兼具热带、亚热带、温带性质，生物资源极为丰富。特别是热带生物资源，在社会主义阵营中占有重要地位。1952年开始有了一千多位科学技术人员响应政府号召在海南岛和粤西对热带资源植物进行了广泛的调查，对于橡胶宜林地的选择，对于建立防护林带和萌生带提出了具体意见；了解了气候因素对植物的影响，以及寒潮对植物生理学上的作用，提出了防寒的各种措施和改进施肥方法的建议。1958年华南队又在考察广西十万大山地区的过程中摸清了该地区的自然条件，并制定了该地区的十九个县的自然区划和六个县的经济区划。在该区找出大面积橡胶宜林地，并找到有经济价值的植物五百三十七种，有经济价值的动物一百三十种，已提出其中特别应该重视的种类。
    六、土壤调查队。任务是配合流域规划需要，进行黄河和长江灌区的土壤调查工作，并进行一定的定位试验工作。1956年开始工作，现仍在继续工作中。土壤调查队在黄河中下游及长江中游地区进行了广大的灌区调查。已调查的面积，黄河流域为二十七万六千平方公里，长江流域为十八万九千平方公里，分别制出了二十万分之一和十万分之一土壤图，不仅满足了黄河长江流域规划的需要，而且直接帮助了一部分人民公社进行了土壤改良规划。在华北、内蒙古、宁夏等地结合地下水进行了土壤盐化的研究，阐明了各种不同的盐渍化类型，并提出了预防盐渍化的意见。
    七、盐湖科学调查队。任务是考察柴达木盆地盐湖资源，研究综合开发利用。1957年开始工作，现仍在继续工作中。柴达木盐湖队不仅对盐湖的情况和某些资源的开发提出了意见，而且直接帮助地方解决有关国家急需的钾肥的土法生产的技术问题。1957到1958年盐湖队在这个区域进行了调查，初步掌握了盐类资源分布和成分等各种资源材料，说明这个盆地不仅有基本化学工业原料所需的食盐储量非常巨大，而且富有工业和各种新技术上所急需的化学原料和农业生产上非常需要的钾。盐湖附近的地层中也发现沉积着各种盐类。继续深入的研究有发现更多资源的可能。就发现的重要资源研究其综合开发利用的方案和工艺流程也在开始。
    八、青甘综合考察队。任务是考察青甘地区工业和农业资源，研究综合开发利用和生产力配置问题。1958年开始工作，预期1961年可告结束。青甘队虽在去年才开始工作，但已对引洮工程的坝址和渠道的一部分工程地质给予了直接的帮助，对河西走廊提出了全面的生产力配置的初步意见。并且对北大河流域的水土资源提出了合理利用的规划意见等。
    九、治沙队。任务是根据1958年10月西北六省、区治沙规划会议上制定的治沙规划方案，进行沙漠改造利用的科学考察工作和试验研究工作。1959年开始组成。它的前身固沙队最初是黄河中游水土保持考察队的一部分，三年来对内蒙古、陕西、宁夏、甘肃等省区的沙漠进行了初步考察，为今后开展治沙工作提供了部分科学资料。
    十、西部地区南水北调综合考察队。任务是根据1959年2月水利电力部和中国科学院共同召集的西部地区南水北调考察规划会议的决定，进行引水路线和该地区资源综合开发利用的综合考察工作。1959年开始组成。
    以上十个考察队的考察范围几乎遍及全国，其中多数是科学资料缺乏，交通不便，供应困难的地区。
    综合考察的若干新发现
    通过考察工作，对于自然条件也有了很多新发现，推翻了某些陈旧的概念，甚至获得了新的解决自然规律的线索和途径，从而帮助了科学的提高。
    过去土壤学家对华北平原的土壤简单地统称为“冲积土”，这只能反映地质沉积作用，而不能反映农业生产特性和土壤的发生演变情况。他们在考察中运用了土壤发生学的理论，查明了各种土壤的过渡演变情况，并详细地划分了土类和变种。过去对亚热带北部地区和暖温带土壤（褐土）如何过渡还不很明确。通过考察工作，知道亚热带北部地区主要为黄棕壤（也有称为黄褐土），分布于长江以北的地区、唐白河谷和汉江以北地区。对于南方水稻土壤的发生演变，也有了进一步的看法。在东北、青海、甘肃及新疆的土壤考察中初步拟定了土壤分种系统，说明了土壤类型分布及其特征。新疆方面肯定灰棕色荒漠土为北疆的地带性土壤。
    地质学家在黑龙江流域地区综合分析了沉积厚度和岩相变化，折绉和断裂情况，岩浆活动，变质作用以及矿产分布特征，初步认识了这个地区的地质发生历史，把这个地区大地构造区分为六个带，指出相应地区矿产远景；在柴达木盆地发现大量钾盐沉积，说明了内陆性湖泊和钾盐沉积的关系；在广西二迭纪地层发现较大量的原生菱铁矿，都为今后开拓了新的找矿方向。
    地貌学家在云南考察中，研究了风化壳型的镍矿的富集和微地貌条件的关系。对于云南地貌的研究，过去只从形态上认识，而忽略了地貌的发育，经过调查，特别是在海拔一千三百五十米的大渡岗（思茅以南）一带的高原面上，发现无可怀疑的河流相沉积，有力地证明了云南高原为过去长期剥蚀所形成，到第三纪末和第四纪初期的地壳运动，上升到现有高度。在巴旦吉林、腾格里、塔克拉马干各沙漠的考察中，证实了沙丘中沙的起源来自附近湖洪积或冲积平原，而非来自远方。
    气候学家考察了东北、新疆、华南地区，并与土壤学家、地植物学家交换意见后，对于我国划分热带亚热带、温带和寒温带的分界线，有了进一步的认识。认为我国亚热带的指标以积温4500—8000℃，最冷月气温2—16℃，无霜期自二百四十——三百六十五天为相宜，照此指标我国亚热带的北界大致接近于北纬34°，也就是淮河秦岭白龙江线直至东经104°，这条线再向西已属高山气候带。这与农业生产上一年两熟的北界大致相符。新疆虽有部分地区全年积温计可超过5000℃（如和田、吐鲁番）或在夏季还可以栽植一年生的亚热带作物，如棉花等，但终因冬季温度太低，常至摄氏零下十度，多年生亚热带植物都不能自然地在露地过冬，所以不应列入亚热带。在广西调查中也提出了关于划分热带亚热带的意见。
    植物学家证明了北疆准噶尔为土耳其斯坦荒漠和亚洲中部荒漠的过渡地带，并提出其西部分界线位于准噶尔西部的界山。在云南植物区系的起源方面也提出了新的见解。
    我国科学力量还比较薄弱，而且缺乏经验，综合考察工作更是如此。但在党的坚强领导和苏联专家的无私帮助之下，已经取得巨大成就，今后随着社会主义建设的高速度发展，还会取得更大的成就。
