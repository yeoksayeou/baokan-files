Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Attending the National Conference of Heroes, the representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers from the fields of agricultural reclamation, forestry, aquatic products, and meteorology have exchanged many effective advanced experiences in the experience exchange meeting over the past six days. The representatives are determined to spread these experiences throughout the country so that they can blossom and bear fruit across the nation, striving for a greater leap forward in various production and construction endeavors.

At the experience exchange meetings held separately by the above four systems, Wang Zhen, Minister of Agricultural Reclamation, Luo Yuchuan, Vice Minister of Forestry, Xu Deheng, Minister of Aquatic Products, and Jiang Bin, Deputy Director of the Central Meteorological Bureau, all spoke on the achievements of their respective systems this year and the tasks for continued leap forward in the future. They called on all employees of their respective systems to hold high the red flag of the General Line, further launch a socialist labor competition, complete and overfulfill this year's production plans faster and better, and prepare for a continued leap forward next year.

The hundreds of rich and colorful experiences brought by the representatives of the four systems were widely and deeply disseminated through group discussions, on-site demonstrations, and individual exchanges. The agricultural reclamation system mainly exchanged experiences in land reclamation, agricultural and animal husbandry production, diversified operations, mechanized farming, and basic construction. Di Shouqian, a representative from the 858 Farm of the Heilongjiang Railway Corps Reclamation Bureau, famous for starting from scratch and running farms diligently and thriftily, introduced their experience in developing animal husbandry; Mohamieye (Kazak), a representative from the Second Ranch of a certain division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, famous for creating a "thousand cows and thousand calves" high-yield record year after year, introduced their experience in carrying out the "pregnant and well-fed livestock" campaign, with a continuous breeding rate of 100% for two thousand cows for years.

The forestry system mainly exchanged experiences in harvesting, transportation, lumbering, replanting, forest chemical industry production, and diversified operations. Narenmandula (Daur), a representative of the Xiniqi Forestry Bureau in the Greater Khingan Range of Inner Mongolia, known as the "Red Flag in the Forest Sea," introduced their advanced experience of opposing rightist tendencies, boosting morale, and completing the three major plan targets of timber production, forest regeneration, and log sales ahead of schedule and comprehensively five months ahead of schedule this year. Ma Yuke, a famous loading expert from the Chaihe Forestry Bureau in Heilongjiang, demonstrated his "non-cutting rope, vertical pillar loading method" at the meeting. The representatives of the forestry system made thorough studies of every detail of their experiences.

The experiences exchanged in the aquatic products system mainly included marine and freshwater fishing, marine and freshwater aquaculture, aquatic product processing, and comprehensive utilization. Zheng Lianpin, the captain of the Shanghai Marine Fisheries Catching Team No. 267 and 268 fishing vessels, introduced their experience in creating the highest yield of marine fishing vessels with the same horsepower in the country. Zhang Jinzhi, an aquaculture expert from the Luda Aquatic Products Farm, introduced the experience of their group in creating the highest record of kelp farming in the country. Yang Shudi, the Party Committee Secretary of the Minjiang Commune in Fujian Province, introduced the commune's practices in developing aquatic aquaculture and fishing, which attracted great attention from the representatives. The meteorological system also exchanged many professional experiences, including the experience of the Jinbei Meteorological Observatory in Shanxi Province in conducting observations and forecasts by county and region, and the experience of the Fenghuo Agricultural Meteorological Experimental Station in Qian County, Shaanxi Province, in serving agricultural production.

At the end of the experience exchange activities, the representatives of the agricultural reclamation, forestry, aquatic products, and meteorology systems all put forward proposals. The proposal of the agricultural reclamation system called on the employees of the agricultural reclamation front to carry out mass movements on a large scale, give full play to the efficiency of machinery, and strive to complete the target of the National Program for Agricultural Development, which stipulates that state-owned farms will reclaim 100 million mu of wasteland by 1967, ahead of schedule. The proposal of the forestry system required forestry workers to seize the current favorable season, vigorously carry out basic construction in forest areas, and harvest a large amount of timber, striving to fell enough timber by the end of this year for timber production in the first half of next year. The proposal of the aquatic products system required employees on the aquatic products front to further carry out the socialist competition movement centered on increasing production and practicing economy and technological innovation. Seize the fishing season, race against time, fight hard in the fourth quarter, strive to over fulfill this year's aquatic production tasks ahead of schedule, and prepare for a continued leap forward next year. The proposal of the meteorological system required the earnest implementation of the policy of "taking service to production as the key link, and taking service to agriculture as the focus," and constantly improve the accuracy of weather forecasts.

    增产更多的农林牧渔产品
    农垦林业水产气象代表倡议开展大竞赛
    据新华社8日讯　出席全国群英会的农垦、林业、水产和气象方面的先进集体和先进生产者代表，六天来在交流经验会上交流了许多行之有效的先进经验。代表们决心要把这些经验传遍全国，使它在全国开花结果，争取各项生产建设的更大跃进。
    在上述四个系统分别召开的经验交流会上，农垦部部长王震、林业部副部长罗玉川、水产部部长许德珩和中央气象局副局长江滨，都分别就本系统今年的成就和今后继续跃进任务讲了话。他们号召本系统的全体职工高举总路线的红旗，进一步开展社会主义劳动竞赛，更快更好地完成和超额完成今年的生产计划，并为明年继续跃进作好准备。
    四个系统的代表带来的数以千百计的丰富多彩的经验，通过分组座谈、现场表演和个别交流，得到了广泛、深入的传播。农垦系统主要交流了垦荒、农牧业生产、多种经营、机耕和基本建设等方面的经验。以白手起家、勤俭办场著名的黑龙江铁道兵农垦局八五八农场的代表遆守谦，介绍了他们发展畜牧业的经验；以连年创造“千牛千犊”高产纪录著名的新疆生产建设兵团农某师第二牧场的代表莫哈米也（哈萨克族），介绍了他们开展牲畜满怀满膘运动、两千头母牛连年繁育率达到100％的经验。
    林业系统主要交流了采伐、运输、制材、迹地更新、林产化学工业生产和多种经营等经验。被誉为“林海红旗”的内蒙古大兴安岭西尼气林业局的代表那仁满都拉（达斡尔族），介绍了他们反右倾、鼓干劲、提前五个月全面超额完成今年木材生产、森林更新和原木销售三大计划指标的先进经验。黑龙江柴河林业局著名的装车能手马玉珂在会上表演了他的“不砍断绳索立柱装车法”。林业系统的代表们对他们这些经验的每一个细节都作了周密的研究。
    水产系统交流的经验主要包括海洋和淡水捕捞、海洋和淡水养殖，水产加工、综合利用等方面。上海海洋渔业捕捞队二六七、二六八号鱼轮船长郑连品介绍的他们创造全国同马力海洋捕捞渔轮最高产量的经验，旅大水产养殖场养殖能手张金枝介绍的他们小组开创全国海带养殖最高纪录的经验，福建省闽江公社党委书记杨树棣介绍的公社发展水产养殖和捕捞的作法，都引起了代表极大的注意。气象系统交流的专业经验方面也很多，其中有山西晋北气象台分县分片进行观测预报的经验，有陕西乾县烽火农业气象试验点为农业生产服务的经验。
    农垦、林业、水产、气象系统的代表们，在结束经验交流活动时，都分别提出了倡议书。农垦系统的倡议书号召农垦战线职工，大搞群众运动，充分发挥机械效能，力争提前完成农业发展纲要规定的到1967年国营农场垦荒达到一亿亩的指标。林业系统的倡议书要求林区职工，抓紧当前大好季节，大搞林区基本建设，大量采伐木材，力争在今年年底为明年上半年木材生产伐倒足够的木材。水产系统的倡议书，要求水产战线职工进一步开展以增产节约和技术革新为中心的社会主义竞赛运动。抓渔汛，抢时间，大战第四季度，力争提前超额完成今年的水产生产任务，并作好明年继续跃进的准备。气象系统的倡议书要求切实贯彻“以生产服务为纲，以农业服务为重点”的方针，不断提高天气预报的准确率。
