Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th: A hundred-ton engine-powered boat has recently appeared on the Tunjiang Reservoir in Tunzhang County, Shanxi Province.

This engine-powered boat, named "Taihang", was built under the leadership of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Transportation and the Tunzhang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, using indigenous methods in place of foreign ones. The boat is equipped with an eighty-horsepower diesel engine and travels at more than fifteen li per hour. The boat has four compartments: a cockpit, an engine room, a cargo hold, and a passenger cabin. The passenger cabin can accommodate more than sixty passengers.

With the rapid development of farmland water conservancy construction, last year the Taihang Mountains in Shanxi Province opened up more than one hundred li of waterway on five reservoirs, including Tunjiang, for the first time. This spring, the Southeast Jin District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Southeast Jin Administrative Office sent water conservancy technical cadres to survey the Qin River, Zhang River, and Dan River, and made plans to continue opening up new waterways.

    太行山上航机轮
    据新华社太原7日电　在山西省屯长县的屯绛水库上，最近出现了一艘百吨机轮。
    这艘被命名为“太行”号的机轮，是在山西省交通厅和中共屯长县委领导下，用以土代洋的办法建成的。机轮内安装一部八十马力的柴油机，每小时航行十五华里以上。机轮内部设有驾驶舱、机舱、货舱和客舱等四个舱位，客舱内可容旅客六十多名。
    随着农田水利建设的飞跃发展，山西太行山区去年第一次开辟了屯绛等五处水库一百多华里的水上航线。今年春天，中共晋东南地委和晋东南专署又派出水利技术干部，对沁河、漳河、丹河三大河流进行勘察，并且作出了继续开辟新航线的规划。
