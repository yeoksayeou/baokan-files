The Night-Shining Pearl of the Zhuang People

Luzhai! This place, which last year saw a massive campaign of small-scale, locally-run steel furnaces, has undergone another tremendous change this year. A small-scale integrated iron and steel enterprise with an annual output of 100,000 tons—the Luzhai Branch of the Liuzhou Iron and Steel Plant—is under construction. It is a night-shining pearl in the eyes of the Zhuang people of Guangxi.

In the absence of construction equipment, mechanical equipment, and sufficient material supplies, and lacking technical expertise, the heroic builders fought against difficulties with their own diligent hands and boundless wisdom. They built a 35-meter-high, 6-meter-diameter hot blast stove chimney in 37 hours; they completed a large 500-ton water tower in 40 hours; without electric welders, they even used indigenous methods to weld together the steel plates for the shells of the blast furnace and hot blast stove.

Now, two 38-cubic-meter small blast furnaces that have already been built are pouring out molten iron day and night; one of the two 83-cubic-meter blast furnaces under construction will also produce iron this year. After the completion of the Luzhai Branch of the Liuzhou Iron and Steel Plant, it will play a significant role in accelerating the development of industry and agriculture in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

    僮族人民的夜明珠
    鹿寨！这个去年大办钢铁小土群的地方，今年又发生了巨变。一座年产十万吨的小型钢铁联合企业——柳州钢铁厂鹿寨分厂正在建设中。它是广西僮族人民的心目中的一颗夜明珠。
    在没有施工、机械设备和材料供应不足、技术力量缺乏的情况下，英勇的建设者们用自己勤劳的双手和无穷的智慧跟困难搏斗。他们用三十七个小时建成了高三十五米、直径六米的热风炉烟囱；用四十小时完成了一座容水五百吨的大水塔；没有电焊机，他们竟用土办法把高炉和热风炉外壳用的一块块的钢板焊接了起来。
    现在，两座已经建成的三十八立方米小高炉日夜倾吐着铁水；两座正在建设中的八十三立方米高炉，也有一座将在今年内出铁。柳州钢铁厂鹿寨分厂建成后，对加速广西僮族自治区的工农业发展将起很大的作用。
