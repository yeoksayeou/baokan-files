Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 18th: Under the strengthened leadership of Party committees at all levels in Suixian County, Henan Province, and using the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, a vigorous mass movement has been launched, and the county has already exceeded the 1959 annual procurement plan for grain, oil, cotton, hemp, and other products. As of October 27th, the county's autumn grain requisition plan, cotton, sesame, peanut kernel, and cottonseed unified purchase plans, and green hemp, fresh egg, live pig, live sheep, and wild medicinal material procurement plans were completed, exceeding the targets by 3% to 123% respectively. The procurement of other small local and special products and the task of cotton stalk bark peeling were also completed well. In September and October, the cotton processing and transportation tasks were also overfulfilled.

This year, the CCP Suixian County Committee's leadership over agricultural product procurement work has been meticulous and specific. From the county committee to the commune and team Party organizations, agricultural product procurement headquarters have been established at each level, implementing political command, with the first secretary of the Party committee taking charge of this work, implementing the method of "three fixings (fixing leading cadres, fixing labor, fixing time) and three guarantees (guaranteeing areas, guaranteeing tasks, guaranteeing work quality), going deep into teams and groups, and following through to the end." The county also criticized right-leaning emotions and slackening thoughts in the procurement work. More than 20,000 people from the county's eleven people's communes and one hundred and fifty-nine brigades were mobilized to publicize the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the state's agricultural product procurement policies in the streets, canteens, and fields. After receiving education, the vast majority of commune and team cadres and members realized that there were many benefits to delivering agricultural and sideline products in a timely manner: first, it can guarantee the needs of national construction; second, it can obtain funds to purchase means of production and expand reproduction; third, it can free up manpower for water conservancy construction; fourth, it can develop diversified operations through the processing and transportation of agricultural and sideline products. As a result, the enthusiasm for delivering agricultural and sideline products in various places has generally increased, and the procurement speed has greatly accelerated. For example, the cadres of the Humiao Brigade of the Hedi People's Commune, on the basis of raising ideological understanding, examined the idea of keeping more and selling less, and delaying delivery, and delivered 105,000 catties of grain at one time, overfulfilling the task.

In the agricultural and sideline product procurement work, Suixian County fully utilized and developed the work experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, implemented the "five fast, five simultaneous, five good" policy, implemented arrangements by battle, continuously conducting small movements within large movements, and short movements within long movements, seizing every opportunity to carry out crash purchases. The county also beat the drums of enthusiasm, commended every event, reported success every day, and upon completion of one type of product, inspected that one type of product. Once this link completed its task, it transferred to the next link, interlocking tightly, so the procurement work was both fast and solid. The county first concentrated on completing the grain requisition task; then completed the cotton, sesame, green hemp, and cottonseed procurement tasks; and finally concentrated its efforts on completing the peanut kernel, wild medicinal material, pig, sheep, and egg procurement tasks. The masses generally praised, "The procurement work is done really well, with large quantities, high quality, fast processing, and timely transportation, which is beneficial to production and is both economical and good."

Organizing large-scale cooperation among various departments under the leadership of the Party committee is also an important experience for Suixian County in doing a good job in procurement. The Party committees at all levels in Suixian County mainly adopted three methods in this regard: first, the Party committee made unified arrangements for production and procurement, grasped the center, drove the general, broke through one point, and drove comprehensive leaps forward; second, held regular meetings to resolve major contradictions and promote work; third, held good collaboration meetings. For example, cadres from the grain, finance, banking, and commercial departments of the Dongdian Commune came out together and, together with the commune members, purchased 420,000 catties of cotton on October 7th. The masses sang, "Departments cooperate on a large scale, fewer people accomplish more, agriculture and commerce leap forward together, benefiting the country, the society, and the people."

    睢县农副产品样样收购得好
    粮油棉麻猪羊蛋都已超额完成全年计划
    新华社郑州18日电　河南省睢县各级党委加强领导，运用1958年大跃进的经验，大搞群众运动，已经超额完成1959年度粮、油、棉、麻等的收购计划。到10月27日止，全县今年度的秋粮征购计划，棉花、芝麻、花生仁、棉籽统购计划和青麻、鲜蛋、生猪、活羊、野生药材收购计划，分别超额3％到123％完成；其他小宗土特产品收购和棉秆皮剥制任务，也完成得很好。9、10月份还超额完成了棉花加工、调运任务。
    今年，中共睢县县委对农产品采购工作的领导细致具体。从县委到社、队党组织，都建立了农产品采购指挥部，层层实行政治挂帅，由党委第一书记抓这个工作，实行“三定（定领导骨干、定劳力、定时间）三包（包地区、包任务、包工作质量）深入队、组，一竿子插到底”的方法，并且批判了采购工作中的右倾情绪和松劲思想。全县十一个人民公社、一百五十九个大队出动了两万多人，在街头、食堂、田间，宣传党的八届八中全会公报、决议和国家的农产品采购政策。广大社、队干部和社员受教育后，认识到及时交售农副产品的好处很多：一是能够保证国家建设需要；二是能够取得资金，购买生产资料，扩大再生产；三是能够腾出人力来进行水利建设；四是能够通过农、副产品的加工、集运，发展多种经营。从而，各地交售农副产品的积极性普遍提高，收购速度大大加快。如河堤人民公社胡庙大队的干部，在提高思想认识的基础上，检查了多留少卖、推迟少交的思想，一次交售粮食十万五千斤，超额完成了任务。
    睢县在农副产品采购工作中，充分运用和发展了1958年大跃进的工作经验，贯彻了“五快、五边、五好”的方针，实行分战役安排，连续不断地在大运动中套小运动，长运动中套短运动，见缝插针，大搞突击收购；大鼓干劲，一事一表扬，一天一报捷，完成一个品种，验收一个品种，这个环节完成任务转上那一个环节，环环扣紧，因此，收购工作既快又扎实。全县首先集中完成粮食征购任务；接着完成了棉花、芝麻、青麻、棉籽收购任务；最后又集中力量完成花生仁、野生药材、猪、羊、蛋收购任务。群众普遍赞扬“收购工作做得真出色，收得多、质量高、加工快、调运及时，有利生产，又省又好。”
    在党委领导下组织各部门大协作，也是睢县做好收购工作的一项重要经验。睢县各级党委在这方面主要采取三种办法：一是党委把生产和收购统一安排，抓好中心，带动一般，突破一点，带动全面跃进；二是定期开会，解决主要矛盾，推动工作；三是开好协作会议。如董店公社粮食、财政、银行、商业各部门的干部一齐出动，同社员一起，在10月7日收购棉花四十二万斤。群众歌颂道：“部门大协作，人少办事多，农商齐跃进，利国利社又利民。”
