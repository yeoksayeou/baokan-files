Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 15th. The chemical industry system of Shaanxi Province has overfulfilled the annual total output value plan fifty days ahead of schedule, with a total output value increase of 48.6% compared to last year. In terms of product output, eighteen major chemical products, including sulfuric acid, caustic soda, sodium sulfide, antibiotics, rickshaw tires, and rubber hoses, have overfulfilled the state plan ahead of schedule. In more than ten months, more than 140 new products have been successfully trial-produced.

Earnestly implementing the policy of "walking on two legs," while focusing on the production and construction of key enterprises, starting with indigenous methods first, and vigorously developing indigenous equipment, has played a significant role in the province's chemical industry completing the annual plan ahead of schedule. For example, the province's chemical system built more than 20 sets of indigenous equipment with an annual output of 400 tons of sulfuric acid this year. Special districts and counties have also universally built indigenous equipment for producing sulfur and saltpeter, and have focused on building indigenous equipment for producing caustic soda, soda ash, bleaching powder, and so on. This year, 35% of sulfur production came from newly built indigenous equipment. Chemical pesticides, sulfuric acid, and other products rely on small-scale indigenous production. As of now, the province has produced more than 700 tons of sulfuric acid using indigenous equipment, supplying the needs of agricultural production.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, dispatch. Sichuan Province has made significant achievements in developing indigenous methods for producing synthetic petroleum. The crude oil output from January to October exceeded the total output of the entire last year by 64%.

At present, all special districts and many counties and cities in the province have established small-scale, batch-type dry distillation plants and crude oil processing plants. The vast majority of coking plants and mines have installed oil extraction equipment, and are vigorously engaged in indigenous methods of oil extraction while coking.

The employees of Sichuan's local petroleum industry have paid special attention to strengthening the technical transformation and technical innovation of indigenous coking methods, continuously tapping production potential, and improving oil yield, thereby effectively ensuring a double leap in both output and quality. In terms of natural draft coking and oil extraction, Fushun County boldly innovated technology, adopting advanced methods such as opening more oil ditches, opening deeper oil ditches, changing the past low chimneys to high chimneys to increase draft, changing non-cooling to circulating water cooling, and adding fire-channel chimneys to shorten coking time and reduce the burning of coking oil. These measures have greatly increased the oil yield, with an average of 38.7 kilograms of oil produced per ton of coke, catching up with the level of mechanical draft oil yield. At the same time, the ash content of coking coal has also been reduced from 28.46% to 15-18%, and the sulfur content has been reduced from 1.5% to about 1%. Many indigenous coking plants have also changed from natural draft oil extraction to power draft oil extraction, gradually moving towards semi-mechanization and mechanization.

In terms of processing, all localities have implemented the comprehensive utilization of crude oil, and can now process more than 20 products such as gasoline, kerosene, diesel, lubricating oil, solvent oil, and phenol.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th. Guangdong Province is focusing on the construction of "small indigenous groups" for sulfuric acid production. The province currently has 49 sets of small-scale indigenous sulfuric acid production equipment, and is currently continuously improving equipment and operations, adding equipment, and further increasing production.

Guangdong Province's small-scale indigenous sulfuric acid production equipment has been built successively since the Great Leap Forward last year. Most of these equipments are distributed in fertilizer plants and chemical plants at the level of Guangzhou City and some special districts and counties. Some of them are equipments attached to sugar factories, pharmaceutical factories, etc., and some are professional small sulfuric acid plants. Not long ago, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Chemical Industry held a working conference on the construction of small-scale contact method sulfuric acid production, and exchanged experiences. The experience of many units has proved that after improving equipment and operation, more pyrite is burned, and burned more thoroughly. The phenomenon of ore dust blocking the converter and acid mud blocking the cooling tube is reduced. A set of small-scale contact method sulfuric acid production equipment can increase from a monthly output of about 10 tons to more than 30 tons.

    抓中小企业  抓土法生产  加速增产急需的工业产品
    陕西化工系统依靠土法提前完成年计划
    四川发展人造石油原油产量已超过去年
    广东抓紧增添和改良制造硫酸的土设备
    新华社西安15日电　陕西省化学工业系统已提前五十天超额完成了全年总产值计划，总产值比去年增长48.6％。产品产量方面，硫酸、烧碱、硫化碱、抗菌素、力车胎、胶管等十八种主要化工产品已提前超额完成了国家计划。在十个多月的时间内，还先后试制成功了一百四十多种新产品。
    认真贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针，在大抓重点企业生产建设的同时，土法先上马，大搞土设备，对于全省化学工业提前完成年计划起了很大的作用。例如今年全省化工系统共建设了二十多套年产四百吨硫酸的土设备。各专区、县也普遍建设了生产硫磺、火硝的土设备，并且重点建设了生产烧碱、纯碱、漂白粉等的土设备。今年硫磺生产就有35％是新建土设备生产的。化学农药、硫酸等产品，更是依靠小型土法生产。截至目前，全省已用土设备生产出了七百多吨硫酸，供应了农业生产的需要。
    据新华社成都电　四川省在发展土法人造石油方面取得重大成绩，1至10月份的原油产量超过了去年全年总产量的64％。
    目前，全省各专区和许多县、市，都建立了小型成堆干馏厂、原油加工厂。绝大部分的炼焦厂矿都安装了采油设备，在炼焦的同时大搞土法采油。
    四川地方石油行业的职工，特别注意加强土法炼焦的技术改造和技术革新工作，不断挖掘生产潜力，提高出油率，从而有效地保证了产量质量双跃进。富顺县在自然抽风炼焦采油方面大胆革新技术，采取多开油沟、深开油沟，改过去低烟囱为高烟囱增加抽力，改不冷却为冷却水循环冷却，增加砌火道烟囱缩短焦化时间、减少炼焦油的燃烧等先进办法，使出油率大大提高，平均每吨焦产油三十八点七公斤，赶上了机械抽风出油率的水平；同时，焦煤灰分也由过去的28.46％降低到15—18％，硫分由过去的1.5％降低到1％左右。许多土法炼焦厂还改变自然抽风采油为动力抽风采油，逐渐向半机械化和机械化迈进。
    在加工方面，各地都实行了对原油的综合利用，现在能加工出汽油、煤油、柴油、润滑油、溶剂油、酚等二十多种产品。
    据新华社广州15日电　广东省抓紧“小土群”硫酸生产建设。全省现有小型土法制硫酸的设备四十九套，目前正不断改良设备和改进操作，增添设备，进一步提高生产。
    广东省的小型土法制硫酸设备，是从去年大跃进以来陆续建设起来的。这些设备大部分分布在广州市和一些专区、县一级的化肥厂、化工厂里，一部分是制糖厂、制药厂等附设的设备，还有一部分是专业的小型硫酸厂。不久前，广东省化学工业厅召开小型接触法硫酸生产建设工作会议，交流了经验。许多单位的经验证明，经过改良设备及改进操作之后，硫铁矿烧得多、烧得透了，矿尘堵塞转化器和酸坭堵塞冷却管的现象减少了，一套小型接触法硫酸生产设备能够由月产量十吨左右增加到三十吨以上。
