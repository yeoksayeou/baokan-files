Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 13th: As of the 9th, Shandong Province had overfulfilled its annual steel production task by 0.28%. The province's steel output in the ten months of this year increased by approximately two times compared to the entire year's output last year (foreign steel).

Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, Shandong Province's steel industry has rapidly developed from small-scale indigenous production last year to small-scale modern production this year. Since the beginning of this year, converter steelmaking units in various regions have universally promoted the advanced experience of Qingdao's hot-blast alkaline iron furnaces, greatly extending the lifespan of iron furnaces and reducing the sulfur content of iron used in steelmaking, enabling converter steelmaking to achieve high output and high quality. In the past two months, the qualified rate of steel ingots in the province has reached over 90%. Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 13th: Thanks to the in-depth development of the production increase and economy practice movement centered on technological revolution, the employees on the copper refining industry front in Shandong Province had overfulfilled the annual electrolytic copper production plan by 5% by the end of October.

Since the beginning of this year, Shandong's electrolytic copper production has not only steadily increased in output, but also continuously improved in quality. Especially since the third quarter, production units have utilized advanced electrolytic solution purification technology and found ways to increase the temperature of the electrolytic solution, enabling the copper content of electrolytic copper to reach over the nationally required 99.95%, while electricity consumption and sulfuric acid consumption have been greatly reduced. Copper refining workers boldly innovated technology, adopting advanced secondary air and compressed air technologies, which greatly shortened smelting time and saved fuel.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 12th: Hunan Province completed its pig iron production plan fifty-seven days ahead of schedule. One hundred thousand steelworkers are advancing victoriously, striving to increase pig iron production even further within the year.

Hunan Province's early completion of the pig iron production plan is a result of deeply opposing Right deviation, encouraging effort, and carrying out the production increase and economy practice movement. Since August, various regions have adhered to putting politics in command, criticizing the Right-leaning thoughts and fear of difficulty among a small number of cadres, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, and rapidly forming a new situation of comprehensive leap forward with high output, high quality, and low consumption in the steel industry. Since late October, the average daily output of pig iron has increased by 1.7 times compared to July, the average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces has also increased from 0.68 in July to 0.9, the coke ratio and ore consumption have been greatly reduced, and the cost of pig iron has also been greatly reduced.

In achieving high output, high quality, and low consumption, various regions have taken many effective measures to address key issues and weak links in production. Since August, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee has prominently focused on coal washing and coking, and transportation, increasing equipment capacity through both indigenous and modern methods, increasing daily coke production from 1,700 tons to 4,500 tons, meeting production needs.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 13th: Fujian Province completed the state-allocated iron smelting task for this year fifty-five days ahead of schedule.

Fujian Province's iron smelting industry was established during the Great Leap Forward of steel production last year. This year, the province carried out technological transformation of "small indigenous groups" of iron smelting enterprises on the one hand, and seized the construction of medium and small-sized iron and steel industries such as the Sanming Iron and Steel Plant and mines such as the Panluo Iron Mine and the Xiyang Iron Mine, gradually forming an iron and steel industry network centered on the Sanming Iron and Steel Plant, and with "small modern groups" and "small indigenous groups" of iron smelting enterprises in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Zhanglu, Fuwen, Guokeng and other places as the backbone.

After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the iron smelting workers throughout the province were in high spirits, further carrying forward the soaring enthusiasm of the Great Leap Forward of steel production last year. The large modern groups, small modern groups, and small indigenous groups all reported successes, and pig iron production rapidly increased. The province's pig iron output in September increased by 1.5 times compared to August, and in October it leaped 83% compared to September. The total output in September and October exceeded the total output from January to July.

    山东完成钢和电解铜年计划湖南福建完成全年产铁任务
    据新华社济南13日电　到9日为止，山东省已超额0.28％完成了全年产钢任务。全省今年十个多月的钢产量，比去年全年的产量（洋钢）增长了两倍左右。
    在党的社会主义建设总路线光辉照耀下，山东省的钢铁工业已迅速由去年的小型土法生产发展成为今年的小型洋法生产。今年以来，各地转炉炼钢单位普遍推广了青岛采用的热风碱性化铁炉的先进经验，使化铁炉寿命大大延长，降低了炼钢用铁的含硫量，使转炉炼钢达到了高产优质。最近两个多月来，全省钢锭合格率已达90％以上。新华社济南13日电　山东省炼铜工业战线职工，由于步步深入地开展了以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，到10月底已经超额5％完成了全年的电解铜生产计划。
    今年以来，山东电解铜的生产，不仅产量稳步上升，质量也不断提高，特别是第三季度以来，各生产单位运用了电解液净化的先进技术，并设法提高了电解液的温度，使电解铜的含铜量达到了国家要求的99.95％以上，而电能消耗和硫酸消耗则大大降低。炼铜职工大胆革新技术，采用了二次空气和压缩空气的先进技术，也大大缩短了熔炼时间和节省了燃料。
    据新华社长沙12日电　湖南省提前五十七天完成了生铁生产计划。十万钢铁职工正乘胜前进，争取年内再增产更多的生铁。
    湖南省提前完成生铁生产计划是深入反右倾，鼓干劲，开展增产节约运动的结果。8月份以来，各地坚持政治挂帅，批判了少数干部中的右倾思想和畏难情绪，调动了广大职工的积极性，在钢铁工业中迅速形成了高产、优质、低耗全面跃进的新局面。10月下旬以来，生铁平均日产量比7月份增长了一点七倍，高炉的平均利用系数也由7月份的零点六八提高到零点九，焦比、矿石消耗量都降低很多，生铁成本也大大降低。
    在实现高产、优质、低耗中，各地都针对生产中的关键问题和薄弱环节采取了许多有力措施。8月以来，中共湖南省委突出地抓洗煤炼焦和运输，土洋并举增加设备能力，使焦炭日产量由一千七百吨提高到四五千吨，满足了生产需要。
    据新华社福州13日电　福建省提前五十五天完成今年国家分配的炼铁任务。
    福建省的炼铁工业是在去年大炼钢铁时建立的。今年，全省一面对“小土群”炼铁企业进行了技术改造，一方面抓紧三明钢铁厂等中小型钢铁工业和潘洛铁矿、西洋铁矿等矿山建设，逐步形成以三明钢铁厂为中心、以福州、厦门、漳庐、富文、郭坑等地“小洋群”、“小土群”炼铁企业为骨干的钢铁工业网。
    党的八届八中全会后，全省炼铁职工意气风发，进一步发扬了去年大炼钢铁的冲天干劲，大洋群、小洋群、小土群各路大军纷传捷报，生铁产量迅速上升。全省9月份生铁产量比8月激增一倍半，10月又比9月跃升83％。9、10两个月的总产量，超过1月至7月总产量。
