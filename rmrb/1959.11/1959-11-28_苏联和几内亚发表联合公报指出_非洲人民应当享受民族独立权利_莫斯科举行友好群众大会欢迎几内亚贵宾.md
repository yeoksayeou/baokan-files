He hopes that the funds freed up by reducing armaments can be used for construction purposes, especially to improve the living standards of underdeveloped countries.

The Soviet government stated that it fully understands the peaceful foreign policy pursued by the government of the Republic of Guinea, which is based on the principle of active neutrality. The communiqué stated that both sides confirmed that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Guinea, based on the principle of peaceful coexistence, are developing smoothly.

Xinhua News Agency, 27th – According to TASS, Moscow: A mass rally of friendship between the Soviet and Guinean people was held in the Kremlin in Moscow on the 26th to welcome President Sékou Touré of the Republic of Guinea and his entourage, who are currently visiting Moscow.

Leaders of the Soviet government and the Communist Party attended the mass rally.

First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Kozlov, and President Touré, spoke at the rally.

In his speech, Kozlov said: "The Soviet government and the Guinean government have a full understanding of all issues involving the interests of both countries." He expressed full agreement with President Touré's view that colonialism is not only an enemy of Africa, but also an enemy of international mutual understanding.

Kozlov emphasized that the people of all countries have an obligation to remain vigilant at all times and to fight for the strict observance of the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Bandung principles.

He said that the Soviet Union's moral and material assistance to independent countries in the East is selfless, and it does not demand the provision of bases or pursue privileges in terms of investment. Kozlov said that the Soviet Union has always advocated that the people of all African countries should unite in the struggle to realize their national aspirations.

Touré said, "We know that there is now an imperialist world and an anti-imperialist world. We are fighting against imperialism, and it goes without saying that we are allies of the world that has chosen freedom and peace for all peoples. Therefore, only countries that oppose colonial oppression and long for peace can become the focus of attention for the people of the colonies."

Touré pointed out that African countries support the proposal made by Soviet Premier Khrushchev at the United Nations General Assembly on complete and thorough disarmament. He said that African countries agree with the Soviet Union's efforts to ease international tensions and ensure world peace.

On this day, President Touré also attended a reception held for him by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government. In the evening, he also gave a speech on Moscow Television at the invitation of the television station.
