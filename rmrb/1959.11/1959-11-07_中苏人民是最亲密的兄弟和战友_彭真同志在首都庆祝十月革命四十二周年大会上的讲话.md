Comrades, friends!

    Here today, we are enthusiastically celebrating the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The October Revolution Day is a holiday for the Soviet people, and it is also a common holiday for the proletariat, working people, oppressed nations, and all progressive people throughout the world. On behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party, please allow me to extend our highest respect and warmest congratulations to the great Soviet people and the great Soviet Communist Party, who are holding high the red flag of the October Revolution!

    The October Revolution ushered in a new era in human history, transitioning from capitalism to socialism and communism. This revolution, led by the great Lenin, ended the history of human exploitation on one-sixth of the world's land and established the first socialist country led by the proletariat where the working people are the masters. This revolution fundamentally shook the imperialist rule over the world and, through its own example, called on and encouraged all exploited people and oppressed nations around the world to rise up and fight for their liberation. The October Revolution was a fundamental turning point in the development of human history. Since the victory of the October Revolution, the situation of the people's victory in the world has been determined.

    The banner of the October Revolution has guided the proletariat of the world and the people of the world to move from victory to greater victory. The forty-two years since the October Revolution have been forty-two years of the socialist Soviet Union's growing strength and the great victory of the socialist system in more and more countries; forty-two years of the growing development of the proletarian revolutionary movement and the national liberation movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries; forty-two years of the imperialist system's increasing collapse and demise; and forty-two years of the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism becoming increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of people all over the world.

    For forty-two years, the great Soviet people, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, have overcome domestic and foreign enemies and numerous difficulties with heroic and tenacious struggles, and have achieved brilliant and splendid achievements, making tremendous contributions to the world. The Soviet people have rapidly built a backward country under the rule of the Tsars into a prosperous and powerful socialist country that is at the forefront of the world in industry, agriculture, culture, science and technology. The practice of Soviet construction fully proves the superiority of the socialist system. Comparing 1958 with 1913, the Soviet Union's total industrial output value increased thirty-five times, while the total industrial output value of the leading capitalist country, the United States, increased only about three times. Moreover, during these forty-odd years, the Soviet Union spent nearly twenty years in periods of war and postwar economic recovery, while the United States made a fortune relying on the two world wars. The Soviet Union's rate of production development has always been beyond the reach of capitalist countries; in the past eight years, it has also surpassed the United States in terms of the absolute increase in total industrial output value and the absolute increase in a series of important industrial products. In the most important field of science and technology the Soviet Union has already left the United States far behind. The Soviet Union was the first country in the world to successfully launch artificial earth satellites, and has successively successfully launched space rockets. The automatic interplanetary station recently launched from Soviet territory, which revealed the secrets of the far side of the moon that mankind has never been able to see, is the highest peak of contemporary scientific development.

    The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, held at the beginning of this year, announced that the Soviet Union has entered a new historical period of comprehensively unfolding the construction of a communist society. The Soviet Union's seven-year plan for the development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965 is the main symbol of entering this new historical period. Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the CPSU headed by Comrade Khrushchev, the Soviet people are victoriously implementing this grand plan. This year, the growth rate of Soviet industrial production has greatly exceeded the average annual task stipulated in the seven-year plan. The production of the means of production will increase by 12%, and the production of consumer goods will increase by 10.5%. The output of major industrial products such as steel, oil, and electricity has increased significantly compared with last year. In agriculture, despite the poor climatic conditions in many regions of the Soviet Union this year, the total harvest of grain, beets, and many other crops will exceed the average annual harvest of the past five years, and cotton will have a bumper harvest. According to the Soviet Union's plan for developing the national economy in 1960, next year the Soviet Union will take another big step forward in solving its basic economic tasks and improving the people's living standards, and will lay a solid foundation for completing the seven-year plan ahead of schedule. In 1960, the Soviet Union's total industrial output value will increase by 8.1% compared with this year, steel production will reach 64.9 million tons, oil production will reach 144 million tons, and power generation will reach 291 billion kilowatt-hours. Soviet agriculture will also flourish further next year. Within two years from 1959 to 1960, the Soviet Union's steel production will be able to increase by 10 million tons, that is, from 54.9 million tons to 64.9 million tons; it took the United States twelve years to do this. Many facts show that the seven-year plan can not only be completed, but it will certainly be greatly overfulfilled. This is a reliable guarantee that the Soviet Union will catch up with and surpass the United States in a relatively short period of time.

    At present, the Soviet people have launched a socialist labor competition movement throughout the country to strive to complete the seven-year plan ahead of schedule. The communist labor teams that have emerged in various regions and departments of the Soviet Union fully demonstrate the Soviet people's enthusiasm and creativity in building communism. In the ranks of the Soviet working people, communist new people like the textile worker Gaganova have emerged, who have a loyal devotion to communism, and who, in order to build a communist society, have shown the noble quality of not caring about material interests. This is the communist attitude towards labor that Lenin actively advocated and enthusiastically praised in "The Great Initiative." Under the call of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, millions of working people have been involved in the mass movement to learn from Gaganova, and helping the backward catch up with the advanced is the main feature of this movement. The plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee held in June this year called on the country to accelerate technological innovation, accelerate the overall mechanization and automation of the production process, and complete the seven-year plan ahead of schedule. This call by the CPSU Central Committee has promoted the country's production and construction to move forward at a faster pace. The achievements of the Soviet people in implementing the seven-year plan are new and great contributions to the cause of world peace and socialism. The great Soviet people are now using vivid facts to show the world a beautiful picture of communism, attracting an increasing number of people to fight for the most sublime cause of communism.

    The Chinese revolution is a continuation of the great October Revolution. Under the influence of the October Revolution, the situation of the Chinese revolution was renewed. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, after a long period of struggle, achieved the great victory of the New Democratic Revolution and established the People's Republic of China. For the past ten years, we have been following the path of the October Revolution, carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction, and have achieved great victories. Under the shining light of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, our country has seen a situation of great leap forward and continuous leap forward in economic construction, and has rapidly realized the people's commune in the countryside. Recently, the people of the whole country have warmly responded to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, opposing rightism, boosting morale, and launching a mass movement to increase production and practice economy and a new upsurge in production and construction. We can complete the main indicators of the original second five-year plan to be completed in 1962 this year, and strive to achieve the goal of catching up with Britain in about ten years (calculated from 1958).

    While celebrating the 42nd anniversary of the October Revolution, the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is in a high tide of economic construction. Now, advancing shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union on the socialist road are our People's Republic of China, the People's Republic of Albania, the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the People's Republic of Hungary, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, the People's Republic of Poland, the People's Republic of Romania, and the Czechoslovak Republic. Throughout the socialist camp, from the east coast of Korea to the Elbe River in Germany, one billion people, under the leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries, are heroically, diligently, and confidently creating their new lives. Socialist countries cooperate closely and support each other, and a continuous common upsurge has emerged in the economy and culture. At present, the United States and other imperialist countries are experiencing serious economic difficulties and worker unemployment, and the shadow of the crisis still hangs over their heads. People can clearly see that imperialism is like the setting sun, dying, and it is impossible to find any force in the world to save it from its fate of demise; socialism is like the rising sun, shining brightly, and there is no force in the world that can stop its victory.

    The growing strength of the socialist camp and the increasing weakening of the imperialist camp have created favorable conditions for the oppressed nations of the world to fight for liberation. Since World War II, many colonial and semi-colonial countries have gained independence. Now, the national liberation movement in Asia is continuing to develop. Africa, known as the "dark continent," has begun to dawn, and the national liberation movement is growing vigorously. In Latin America, which is regarded as the "backyard" by US imperialism, the national democratic movement is continuing its upsurge. The October Revolution built a bridge between the proletarian revolutionary movement and the national-liberation movement. The struggle of the vast people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialist oppression is by no means isolated; it is supported by the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and it is also supported by the proletariat and working people in imperialist countries. In the process of their advance, they will still encounter sabotage and obstruction from imperialism and reactionaries of various countries, and there will still be some twists and turns and difficulties, but their heroic struggle will certainly achieve complete victory in the end.

    The imperialist policy of war and aggression has caused serious threats and disasters to the people of the world, including their own people. In imperialist countries, more and more people are involved in the struggle against imperialist war policies and policies of aggression and in defense of peace. The workers' movement and strike struggles in imperialist countries are continuing to develop. The great strike of American steelworkers has exceeded one hundred days, giving the American monopoly capital a great blow and demonstrating the strength of the American working class. There is no doubt that in imperialist countries, the struggle of the masses of people to defend peace, fight for progress, and fight for socialism will also break through various difficulties and achieve final victory.

    Maintaining peace and preventing war are the most important political tasks of the present era. Under the banner of defending peace, people of all countries, nationalities, and classes throughout the world have formed the broadest united front. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union stands at the forefront of defending world peace. The socialist system is fundamentally opposed to the capitalist system. It neither needs nor allows the use of plunder and aggressive wars as a means of developing its own economy. Lenin immediately issued the "Decree on Peace" at the time of the victory of the October Revolution. The October Revolution pointed out to the people of the world a path to fundamentally eliminate war. Striving for peace and opposing imperialist aggression and war are the unshakable basic principles of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries have consistently followed this principle, made unremitting efforts, and effectively prevented the schemes of the imperialist bellicose groups to carry out war and aggression. The peace policy of the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has been warmly supported by the people of the world. Not long ago, Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States made a significant contribution to the cause of easing international tensions and maintaining world peace. The Soviet Union's recent initiative for complete and thorough disarmament has been welcomed and supported by our people and all socialist countries, as well as all peace-loving countries and people throughout the world. Striving for peace is the basic principle of our country's foreign policy. Our people earnestly hope to obtain a lasting peaceful international environment to facilitate the development of our country's socialist construction. Our country has consistently adhered to the five principles of peaceful coexistence as the basis for establishing and developing peaceful and friendly relations with all countries with different social systems. Our country has always advocated resolving all international disputes through peaceful means. In the future, our people will always stand unswervingly with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as all peace-loving countries and people in the world, and will fight to maintain world peace and oppose imperialist aggression and war policies.

    The current world situation is becoming more and more favorable to the cause of peace of the people of the world, and more and more unfavorable to the imperialist forces of war. The war policy and the policy of aggression of the imperialist reactionaries headed by US imperialism are increasingly suffering shameful defeats. The forces of maintaining peace in the contemporary era have overwhelmed the forces of war. The US imperialist bellicose clique, under the opposition of the people of the world, including its own people, has increasingly entered a dead end and is in an embarrassing situation of being unable to advance or retreat. At present, although the US authorities still do not abandon their war policy and their policy of aggression, at the same time, they have to express their hope for peace and have to agree to the Soviet Union's proposal to hold a summit meeting. As long as all peace-loving countries and people in the world further unite, persist in struggle, further isolate the US imperialist bellicose clique, and make it more difficult for it to launch a war, lasting world peace can be guaranteed. At present, US imperialism is still continuing to create international tensions in Turkey, Laos, and many other places. The United States is still occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, and recently manipulated the UN General Assembly to pass an illegal resolution on the so-called "Tibetan issue," rudely interfering in our country's internal affairs. We must continue to maintain sufficient vigilance, hold high the banner of opposing aggression, opposing war, and defending peace, and bravely advance.

    The unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the unity of the international communist movement centered on the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are an important guarantee of world peace and the fundamental interests of the working people of the world. Our unity is constantly strengthening and developing. This is unity on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, so it is the most solid unity. The conference of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties held in Moscow two years ago summarized the experience of the international communist movement over the past century, especially since the October Revolution, and established a new political and ideological foundation for the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement. In the past two years, the Communist Parties of various countries have supported each other in their common struggle and have been united in defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism. The unity of the socialist camp and the unity of the international communist movement are the core of all broader international unity in the contemporary era. The working class of the whole world, the working people of the whole world, the oppressed nations of the whole world, and the forces of the whole world that maintain peace and demand progress are further closely uniting. This great unity is the basic guarantee that we will surely achieve victory. Imperialism and modern revisionists always vainly attempt to undermine the unity of the countries of the socialist camp, undermine the unity of the international communist movement, and undermine the great unity of the people of the world. Their despicable tricks have been continuously met with shameful failures, and they will certainly continue to be defeated.

    The October Revolution was a great result of Marxism-Leninism's victory over revisionism. During the period of the October Revolution and the period of the First World War before the October Revolution, Lenin led the Communists of various countries to conduct an irreconcilable struggle against the revisionists in the international workers' movement, thoroughly exposing and smashing the reactionary tendencies of using bourgeois nationalism and bourgeois reformism to paralyze the working class. The Declaration of the Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries held in Moscow in November 1957 pointed out: "Under current conditions, the main danger is revisionism, or right-wing opportunism." Therefore, inheriting Lenin's tradition, inheriting the tradition of the October Revolution, and continuing to wage a resolute struggle against the trend of revisionism are the basic guarantees for maintaining the unity of the international communist movement. This is an extremely important task in the current international communist movement.

    The Chinese and Soviet people are the closest brothers and the most loyal comrades-in-arms. No matter what, we will always be closely united. We are carrying out a common struggle to develop the cause of socialism, maintain world peace, and strive for human progress. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The unity of the Chinese and Soviet people is extremely important. When the people of these two countries are united, the unity of the people of the world will not be difficult." Comrade Khrushchev said, "The friendship between the Soviet Union and China is in line with the fundamental interests of our two countries and the entire socialist camp, and it is in line with the cause of world peace. The unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of our two great countries and the people of all countries in the entire socialist camp is an indestructible fortress for the peace and security of all countries, and it is a guarantee for the future victory of socialism and communism." In the long period of revolutionary and construction struggles in the past, our people have consistently received fraternal support and assistance from the Soviet Union. Here, we express our heartfelt thanks to the great Soviet people, the Soviet Communist Party, and the Soviet government.

    Comrades, friends! The forty-two-year history since the Great October Socialist Revolution has undoubtedly confirmed the truth of Marxism-Leninism: The forces of peace will surely defeat the imperialist forces of war, the oppressed nations will surely overthrow the reactionary rule of colonialism, and the socialist system will surely replace the capitalist system. The wheels of history cannot be stopped. The glory of the October Revolution will always illuminate us. Let us hold even higher the revolutionary banner of invincible Marxism-Leninism and advance towards new and even greater victories for peace and socialism!

    Long live the great October Socialist Revolution!

    Long live the great and unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union!

    Long live the great and militant Marxism-Leninism!

    中苏人民是最亲密的兄弟和战友
    彭真同志在首都庆祝十月革命四十二周年大会上的讲话亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    现在，我们在这里，热烈地庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年。十月革命节，是苏联人民的节日，也是全世界无产阶级、劳动人民、被压迫民族和全体进步人类的共同节日。请让我以中国人民和中国共产党的名义，向高举十月革命红旗的伟大的苏联人民和伟大的苏联共产党，致以崇高的敬意和热烈的祝贺！
    十月革命开辟了人类由资本主义过渡到社会主义和共产主义的新时代。伟大的列宁所领导的这个革命，在世界六分之一的土地上结束了人剥削人的历史，创立了第一个无产阶级领导的、劳动人民当家作主的社会主义国家。这个革命，从根本上动摇了帝国主义对全世界的统治，并且以自己的榜样，号召和鼓舞全世界一切被剥削的人民和被压迫的民族，起来进行解放自己的斗争。十月革命是人类历史发展的根本转折点。自从十月革命胜利以后，世界上人民胜利的局面就确定了。
    十月革命的旗帜，引导全世界无产阶级和全世界人民，从胜利走向更大的胜利。十月革命以来的四十二年，是社会主义的苏联日益发展壮大，社会主义制度在愈来愈多的国家中取得伟大胜利的四十二年；是各国无产阶级革命运动和殖民地半殖民地国家民族解放运动日益发展的四十二年；是帝国主义制度日益走向崩溃和灭亡的四十二年；是马克思列宁主义的伟大思想在全世界日益深入人心的四十二年。
    四十二年来，伟大的苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，以英勇顽强的斗争，战胜了国内外敌人，战胜了重重困难，取得了光辉灿烂的成就，对全世界作出了巨大的贡献。苏联人民把原来在沙皇统治下的落后的国家，迅速地建设成为一个在工业、农业、文化科学各方面都居于世界最前列的繁荣富强的社会主义国家。苏联建设的实践，充分地证明了社会主义制度的优越性。以1958年和1913年比较，苏联的工业总产值增长了三十五倍，资本主义头号国家——美国的工业总产值增长不过三倍左右。而且，在这四十多年中，苏联差不多有二十年处于战争和战后恢复国民经济时期，美国却依靠两次世界大战发了横财。苏联在生产发展速度上，一向是资本主义国家望尘莫及的；近八年来，在工业总产值的绝对增长量和一系列重要工业产品的绝对增长量方面，也超过了美国。在最重要的科学技术的领域里，苏联已经把美国远远地抛在后面。苏联是全世界第一个成功地发射人造地球卫星的国家，并且连续成功地发射出宇宙火箭。最近从苏联国土上发射的自动行星际站，揭开了人类从来不能看到的月球背面的秘密，更是当代科学发展的最高峰。
    今年年初举行的苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会宣布，苏联已经进入了全面展开共产主义社会建设的新的历史时期。苏联1959年到1965年发展国民经济的七年计划，是进入这个新的历史时期的主要标志。在以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏共中央的领导下，苏联人民正在胜利地实施这个规模宏伟的计划。今年苏联工业生产增长速度大大超过七年计划所规定的年平均任务。生产资料的生产将增加12％，消费品生产将增加10.5％。钢、石油、电力等等主要工业产品的产量，都比去年有很大的增长。在农业方面，尽管今年苏联许多地区的气候条件不好，但是谷物、甜菜和其他许多农作物的总收获量，将超过最近五年的年平均收获量，而棉花将获得丰收。根据苏联1960年发展国民经济的计划，明年，苏联又将在解决它的基本经济任务和提高人民生活水平方面再向前迈进一大步，并且将为提前完成七年计划打下稳固的基础。1960年，苏联工业总产值将比今年增加8.1％，钢产量将达到六千四百九十万吨，石油产量将达到一亿四千四百万吨，发电量将达到二千九百一十亿度。苏联的农业在明年也将进一步蓬勃发展。1959到1960年两年内，苏联的钢产量就能够增加一千万吨，即从五千四百九十万吨增加到六千四百九十万吨；美国为了做到这一点，曾经花了十二年时间。许多事实说明，七年计划不仅能够完成，而且一定能够大大超额完成。这是苏联必将在比较短的时间内赶上和超过美国的可靠保证。
    现在，苏联人民在全国范围内展开了争取提前完成七年计划的社会主义劳动竞赛运动。苏联各地、各企业部门出现的共产主义劳动队，充分表现了苏联人民建设共产主义的积极性和创造性。在苏联劳动人民的队伍中，出现了像纺织工人加干诺娃这样的共产主义新人，他们具有对于共产主义忠心耿耿的思想，为了建成共产主义社会，表现了不计较物质利益的高贵品质。这就是列宁在“伟大的创举”中所积极提倡和热烈歌颂的共产主义劳动态度。在苏联共产党的号召下，千百万劳动人民卷入了学习加干诺娃的群众运动，帮助落后赶上先进是这个运动的主要特点。今年6月召开的苏共中央全会，号召全国加速技术革新，加速生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化，提前完成七年计划。苏共中央的这个号召推动了全国的生产建设以更快的速度向前迈进。苏联人民在实施七年计划中的成就，是对于世界和平和社会主义事业的新的巨大贡献。伟大的苏联人民，现在正在用生动的事实，向全世界展示出一幅美好的共产主义的图画，吸引着愈来愈广泛的人们，为最崇高的共产主义事业而奋斗。
    中国革命是伟大的十月革命的继续。在十月革命的影响下，中国革命的局面为之一新。在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，中国人民经过了长期的斗争，取得了新民主主义革命的伟大胜利，建立了中华人民共和国。十年来，我们又沿着十月革命的道路，进行了社会主义革命和社会主义建设，取得了伟大的胜利。在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，我国出现了经济建设大跃进和持续跃进的局面，并且迅速地实现了农村的人民公社化。最近，全国人民热烈地响应党的八届八中全会的号召，反右倾，鼓干劲，掀起了一个群众性的增产节约运动和生产建设的新高潮。我们可以在今年完成原定在1962年完成的第二个五年计划的主要指标，并且争取在十年左右的时间内（从1958年算起）实现赶上英国的目标。
    在庆祝十月革命四十二周年的时候，以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营都处在经济建设的高潮中。现在，同苏联一起，在社会主义道路上并肩前进的，有我们中华人民共和国，有阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、越南民主共和国、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国、波兰人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国。在整个的社会主义阵营中，从朝鲜的东海岸到德国的易北河，十亿人民在各国共产党和工人党的领导下，英勇勤劳地、满怀信心地创造着自己的新生活。社会主义各国亲密合作，互相支援，在经济和文化上出现了不断的共同高涨。现在，美国和其他帝国主义国家，存在着严重的经济困难和工人失业现象，危机的阴影仍然笼罩在它们的头上。人们可以很清楚地看到，帝国主义有如日落西山，奄奄一息，不可能在世界上找到任何力量来挽救灭亡的命运；社会主义有如旭日东升，光芒万丈，世界上没有任何力量可以阻止它的胜利。
    社会主义阵营的日益壮大和帝国主义阵营的日益削弱，造成了全世界被压迫民族争取解放的有利条件。第二次世界大战以后，已经有许多殖民地、半殖民地国家，取得了独立。现在，亚洲的民族解放运动正在继续发展。被称为“黑暗大陆”的非洲，已经开始破晓，民族解放运动正在蓬勃地生长。被美帝国主义当做“后院”的拉丁美洲，民族民主运动正在继续高涨。十月革命在无产阶级革命运动和民族解放运动之间架起了一座桥梁。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的广大人民反对帝国主义压迫的斗争决不是孤立的，它得到以苏联为首的社会主义国家的支持，也得到帝国主义国家内的无产阶级和劳动人民的支持。在他们前进的过程中，还会遇到帝国主义和各国反动派的破坏和阻挠，还会出现某些曲折和困难，但是，他们的英勇斗争一定能够最后达到彻底的胜利。
    帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策给全世界人民，包括它们本国的人民造成了严重的威胁和带来了灾害。在帝国主义国家内，越来越多的人卷入了反对帝国主义的战争政策、侵略政策和维护和平的斗争。帝国主义国家内的工人运动和罢工斗争正在继续发展。美国钢铁工人的大罢工，已经超过了一百天，给了美国垄断资本很大的打击，显示了美国工人阶级的力量。毫无疑问，在帝国主义国家中，人民群众保卫和平、争取进步、争取社会主义的斗争，也必将冲破各种困难，取得最后胜利。
    维护和平、制止战争，是当代最重要的政治任务。在保卫和平的旗帜下，全世界各国、各民族、各阶层的人民，结成了最广泛的统一战线。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，站在保卫世界和平的最前列。社会主义制度，和资本主义制度根本相反，它决不需要，也决不允许用掠夺和侵略战争作为发展自己经济的手段。列宁在十月革命胜利的时候，立即颁发了“和平法令”。十月革命，向全世界人民指出了一条从根本上消灭战争的道路。争取和平、反对帝国主义侵略和战争，是苏联和其他社会主义国家对外政策的不可动摇的基本原则。苏联和其他社会主义国家，一贯遵循这个原则，进行了不懈的努力，有力地阻止了帝国主义好战集团进行战争和侵略的阴谋。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的和平政策，得到了全世界人民的热烈拥护。不久以前，赫鲁晓夫同志访问美国，对于缓和国际紧张局势、维护世界和平的事业，作出了重大的贡献。苏联最近提出的全面彻底裁军的创议，得到了我国人民和所有社会主义国家以及全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的欢迎和支持。争取和平是我国对外政策的基本原则。我国人民殷切地希望获得持久和平的国际环境，以利于我国社会主义建设事业的发展。我国一贯坚持以和平共处的五项原则为基础，同一切社会制度不同的国家建立和发展和平友好的关系。我国一向主张通过和平的方式来解决一切国际争端。今后，我国人民仍将始终不渝地同苏联和其他社会主义国家以及全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民在一起，为维护世界和平、反对帝国主义的侵略和战争政策而奋斗。
    目前世界形势愈来愈有利于世界人民的和平事业，愈来愈不利于帝国主义战争势力。以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义反动派的战争政策和侵略政策，正在日益遭到可耻的失败。当代维护和平的力量已经压倒了战争势力。美帝国主义好战集团在全世界人民、包括它本国人民的反对之下，已经越来越走入了死胡同，陷入进退维谷的尴尬境地。现在，美国当局虽然仍不放弃它的战争政策和侵略政策，但是同时却不得不表示希望和平，不得不同意苏联提出的举行最高首脑会议的建议。只要全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民，进一步团结起来，坚持斗争，使美帝国主义好战集团更加孤立，使它发动战争更加困难，世界的持久和平就可以获得保障。目前，美帝国主义仍然在土耳其、老挝和其他许多地方继续制造国际紧张局势，美国仍然侵占着我国的领土台湾，并且在最近操纵联合国大会通过所谓“西藏问题”的非法决议，粗暴地干涉我国的内政。我们必须继续保持足够的警惕，高举反对侵略、反对战争、保卫和平的旗帜奋勇前进。
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，和以苏联共产党为中心的国际共产主义运动的团结，是世界和平的重要保证，是全世界劳动人民的根本利益。我们的团结，正在不断地增强和发展。这是在马克思列宁主义基础上的团结，因此是最巩固的团结。两年前在莫斯科举行的共产党和工人党代表会议，总结了近百年来、特别是十月革命以来国际共产主义运动的经验，为社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结奠定了新的政治和思想基础。两年来，各国共产党在共同斗争中互相支持，在保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性方面团结一致。社会主义阵营的团结和国际共产主义运动的团结是当代一切更广泛的国际团结的核心。全世界的工人阶级，全世界的劳动人民，全世界的被压迫民族和全世界维护和平和要求进步的力量，正在进一步紧密地团结起来。这种伟大的团结是我们必将取得胜利的基本保证。帝国主义和现代修正主义者，总是妄想破坏社会主义阵营各国的团结，破坏国际共产主义运动的团结，破坏全世界人民的大团结。他们的卑鄙的伎俩，不断地遭到了可耻的失败，还一定要继续遭到失败。
    十月革命是马克思列宁主义战胜修正主义的一个伟大结果。在十月革命时期和十月革命前的第一次世界大战时期，列宁领导各国共产主义者，向国际工人运动中的修正主义者进行了不调和的斗争，彻底揭露和粉碎了用资产阶级民族主义和资产阶级改良主义来麻痹工人阶级的反动倾向。1957年11月在莫斯科召开的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言中指出：“在目前条件下，主要的危险是修正主义，或者说右倾机会主义。”因此，继承列宁的传统，继承十月革命的传统，继续向修正主义思潮进行坚决的斗争，这是维护国际共产主义运动团结的基本保证，这是当前国际共产主义运动中的一个极其重要的任务。
    中苏两国人民是最亲密的兄弟和最忠诚的战友，不论在什么时候，我们永远亲密地团结在一起。我们为了发展社会主义事业、维护世界和平、争取人类进步，进行着共同的斗争。毛泽东同志说，“中苏两国人民的团结极为重要，这两国人民团结一致了，世界人民的团结就不困难了。”赫鲁晓夫同志说，“苏中两国的友谊符合我们两国和整个社会主义阵营的根本利益，符合世界和平事业。我们两个伟大国家的人民，整个社会主义阵营各国人民的牢不可破的兄弟友谊，是各国人民和平与安全不可摧毁的堡垒，是社会主义、共产主义未来胜利的保证。”在过去长时期革命和建设的斗争中，我国人民一贯地得到苏联兄弟般的支持和援助。在这里，我们向伟大的苏联人民、苏联共产党和苏联政府表示衷心的感谢。
    同志们，朋友们！伟大的十月社会主义革命以来四十二年的历史，确定无疑地证实了马克思列宁主义的真理：和平力量必将战胜帝国主义战争势力，被压迫民族必将推翻殖民主义反动统治，社会主义制度必将代替资本主义制度。历史的车轮是不能阻挡的。十月革命的光辉永远照耀着我们。让我们更高地举起战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的革命旗帜，向着和平和社会主义的新的更加伟大的胜利前进！
