Who Invented Reinforced Concrete?

The ingenious inventor of reinforced concrete, the basic material of modern construction industry, was neither an engineer nor a chemist, nor an architect or a geologist, but a gardener who had nothing to do with construction - Frenchman Monier (1823-1906). This was his first and last invention in his life, but at the time he did not know that his invention had brought a revolution to the construction industry.

Flowers are always dug out with their roots and soil and then transplanted into flowerpots. This is of course very simple, but transplanting palms is not so easy: because the roots of palms are very hard, and under their pressure, clay flowerpots will crack. Therefore, Monier made some wooden barrels for the palms, but wood was too expensive, time-consuming, and in addition, metal hoops had to be installed outside the wooden barrels, making such flowerpots too uneconomical.

So Monier began to look for materials cheaper than wood.

He thought of cement, which is harder than clay, and decided to give it a try.

But cement flowerpots also cracked. To make up for this shortcoming, Monier hooped it with iron hoops, but this kind of flowerpot was very unsightly, so he poured a layer of cement on the outside, thus obtaining reinforced concrete. Later, Monier used coarse iron wire as the skeleton of the flowerpot, sandwiching it between thin layers of cement.

### 钢筋混凝土是谁发明的？

    钢筋混凝土是谁发明的？
    现代建筑工业的基本材料——钢筋混凝土的天才发明家既不是工程师和化学家，也不是建筑师和地质学家，而是一个与建筑毫无一点关联的花匠——法国人蒙埃（1823—1906）。这是他一生中最初的也是最后的发明，然而当时他并不知道自己的发明给建筑业带来了革命。
    花总是连根带泥掘出，然后移植至花盆中。这当然很简单，可是移植棕榈就不然了：因为棕榈的根很硬，在它们的压力下，粘土制的花盆就会破裂。因此蒙埃为棕榈做了些木桶，可是木材太贵，费时又久，此外，还要在木桶外面装上金属箍，这样的花盆太不合算了。
    于是蒙埃开始找寻比木材便宜的材料。
    他想起了比粘土坚硬的水泥，决定试一试。
    可是水泥做的花盆也裂开了。为了弥补这个缺点，蒙埃用铁箍箍住它，然而这种花盆非常难看，因此他在外面浇上一层水泥，这样就得到了钢筋混凝土。后来，蒙埃用粗铁丝做成花盆的骨干，把它夹在薄层的水泥中。
