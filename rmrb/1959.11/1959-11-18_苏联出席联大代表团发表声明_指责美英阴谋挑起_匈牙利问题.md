    Prevent Cold War Forces from Poisoning the International Atmosphere
    Soviet Delegation to the UN Issues Statement
    Accusing the US and Britain of Conspiring to Provoke the "Hungarian Question"
    Xinhua News Agency, November 17th, TASS, New York: The Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly issued a statement to the press on the 16th. The statement said that “New York Times” correspondent in the United Nations, Hamilton, quoted "authoritative sources" as reporting that the United States, Britain, France, and some other Western countries have decided to insist on discussing the so-called Hungarian question at the current session of the United Nations General Assembly.
    Therefore, the Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to state that the Western countries' efforts to include the non-existent Hungarian question on the agenda of the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly is merely an attempt to restore the atmosphere of the "Cold War" within the United Nations.
    Obviously, some people in the West are in no way reconciled to the beginning of the easing of international tensions. These people openly want to turn back the clock and undermine the spirit of cooperation established by the meeting at Camp David.
    The attempt to provoke the Hungarian question is clearly aimed at using the United Nations General Assembly to worsen international relations. This shows that the Western countries intend to continue to crudely violate the principles of the United Nations Charter, which will only strike another blow to the prestige of the United Nations.
    The Soviet delegation believes that the duty of all those who truly desire a further improvement in the international situation is to prevent the revival of the atmosphere of the "Cold War" in the United Nations, and not to allow the General Assembly to deviate from the path of resolving mature and important international issues in accordance with the interests of safeguarding and consolidating universal peace.

### 苏联出席联大代表团发表声明  指责美英阴谋挑起“匈牙利问题”

    制止冷战势力毒化国际气氛
    苏联出席联大代表团发表声明
    指责美英阴谋挑起“匈牙利问题”
    据新华社17日讯　塔斯社纽约讯：出席联合国大会的苏联代表团16日向报界发表声明。声明说：“纽约时报”驻联合国记者汉密尔顿引用“权威人士”的话报道，美国、英国、法国和其他一些西方国家决定坚持要在联合国大会本届会议上讨论所谓匈牙利问题。
    因此，苏联代表团认为有必要声明，西方国家竭力把并不存在的匈牙利问题列入联合国大会第十四届会议议程，只不过是企图在联合国范围内恢复“冷战”的气氛而已。
    显然，西方某些人士对国际紧张局势的开始缓和无论如何也不甘心。这些人公然想开倒车，想破坏由于在戴维营举行的会晤而建立的合作精神。
    阴谋挑起匈牙利问题的企图显然是为了利用联合国大会来恶化国际关系。这表明西方国家打算继续粗暴地破坏联合国宪章的原则，而这只会再一次打击联合国的威信。
    苏联代表团认为，所有真正渴望国际局势进一步好转的人的职责在于，阻止“冷战”的气氛在联合国复活，不让大会离开根据保卫和巩固普遍和平的利益解决成熟了的重要的国际问题的道路。
