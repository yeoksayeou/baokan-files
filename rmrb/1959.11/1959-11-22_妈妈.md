Mom
	Haoran

	The sun has set, and the door is locked. I wonder where Mom has gone. Looking at the shiny brass lock, I keep wondering: Has Mom really gone to the team to raise pigs? Raising pigs is a hard job, busy day and night, and you can't rest in wind or rain. She's so old and her health isn't good, can she manage it? If I hadn't gone to build the reservoir, I would have stopped her no matter what.

	Thinking this, I was about to go out when Mom came running back, panting.

	"Baosen, oh dear, Mom missed you so much! Oh, you're tanned and plump! Collective living really does make a person stronger!" Mom held my shoulders tightly, looking me up and down.

	I looked at her too. In just a few months, the gray hair on her head seemed thinner, and the wrinkles on her face seemed deeper. I said, "You seem to have lost weight."

	"Silly child, do you know how fat the pigs in our team have become!" she said with a smile, releasing my shoulders, smoothing her hair, and shaking her shoulders, as if to show me that she wasn't weak at all. Then, she said even more excitedly, "Baosen, this time Mom's wish has come true. When I was a girl, I loved raising pigs. But we rely on the mountains here, and planting on the hillsides doesn't use manure, so people aren't used to raising pigs. Since I married here, I've been separated from pigs. Now, there are three pig farms in our production team alone, and every household is raising pigs. I finally have something to do! The captain even insisted that I have experience and pulled me in as a technician and pig farm manager. What kind of material am I! But if I'm asked to do it, I'll do it! People think highly of me, can I let them down?"

	Her excitement immediately infected me, and the words I had prepared to say to her could no longer be spoken.

	"I just got some corn cobs from the storage section, and after grinding them, they can be used as pig feed. To increase production and save resources, we have to find more ways," she changed the subject, and then pulled me along, saying, "I'm worried I can't move it, come and help me."

	A small cart was parked outside the door, with two large baskets on it, filled to the brim with corn cobs. She pulled, I pushed, all the way west. When we arrived at the pig farm and unloaded the cart, I was about to go back when Mom stopped me, saying, "Baosen, Mom doesn't have time to stay at home with you, and won't have time to take care of you in the future. I think you should just move in with Mom!"

	I thought, why leave a perfectly good home and come here to be lonely? I'm not a feeder. But when I looked directly into Mom's expectant eyes, I couldn't say anything against her wishes. It seemed she really intended to keep working at the pig farm.

	Seeing my hesitation, Mom said in a very affectionate tone, "Baosen, Mom really can't leave these pigs. Our farm is a breeding farm, and that's an important job! I came here when the first shovel of dirt was moved to build this place; I fed these sows their first scoop, I drove them to mate, I helped them give birth, and I personally handed over the grown piglets to the commune members. Now, which team in the entire management area doesn't have piglets from our farm? And all the fertilizer for the high-yield fields comes from our farm too... Anyway, Mom can't leave here; but I can't leave you either. You move over here, and it's a win-win situation, okay?"

	What else could I say? I could only nod.

	Mom was even happier, leading me to tour their pig pens, enthusiastically introducing the pig breeds, the environmental hygiene, and the new feeding methods here. Occasionally, she would affectionately say something to the fat pigs that wagged their tails and grunted at her. After each introduction, she would stop and ask me "How is it?", and when I nodded, she couldn't help but praise herself, "It's just good, it's just good!" After the tour, she seemed to remember something important, and pulled me back to her room.

	She jumped onto the kang (platform bed) and took down a worn-out book from a hanging wooden board on the wall, handing it to me: "I got this from the feeder training class. I've read it several times, and I can't recognize half the words. It's great that you're here, we'll hire you as a teacher, and you can give us a lecture every day."

	I took it and flipped through it, it was full of specialized experience and methods: "I don't know anything about it, how can I give lectures?"

	Mom said, "It doesn't matter, just read it to me. You read and I listen, and when I understand, I'll explain it. We're going to have class later, so take a look."

	Sure enough, after eating, people came one after another, and before long there was a room full of people. There were young wives, teenage girls, and several old ladies about the same age as my mother. I recognized some of them, and some were from other villages. Talking and laughing, they made the quiet pig farm lively in no time.

	Mom put on her reading glasses and said to everyone, "Everyone's here, let's start class." Only then did I realize that there was a door panel leaning against the wall next to Mom, painted with soot, probably to be used as a blackboard.

	Mom stood in front of everyone and said, "Today I'll have to dig it out of my own stomach, tomorrow we'll talk according to the book. I have a teacher now!" With that, she took out half a piece of chalk from her pocket, held it between her two fingers, faced the blackboard, and struck a pose. When she finished writing and stepped aside, I could see clearly that she had drawn a fat, big sow.

	Mom rubbed the chalk dust in her hands and said, "Today I'm going to talk about estrus and mating in sows." Then, she pointed to the picture and started to explain.

	"Chuckle—chuckle," "Hee hee," the women either laughed or lowered their heads to their chests.

	Mom got angry. I had never seen her get angry with outsiders in all my years of growing up with her:

	"What's wrong with you? What are you laughing at? Ha! I told the captain a few days ago that there's a shortage of labor to build the big reservoir, so hurry up and replace the pig farm with more women. This job is suitable for us, freeing up some male labor to build the reservoir. I wore my tongue out, and they only agreed to let you come. Look, we haven't even let you do anything yet, and you're already acting all twisted like this. How can we rely on you to do big things in the future?"

	Unexpectedly, her words had such mobilizing power. The women, one by one, raised their heads and listened to her seriously and solemnly.

	Mom smiled: "That's right, that's the way it should be. I don't like people who frown all day long and don't even smile when they see boiled dumplings. The current days are like burning charcoal, the more you burn, the more prosperous it becomes, so what are you worried about? But, you can laugh when you should laugh, and you must be serious when you should be serious. We can't just shout about equality between men and women, and then automatically sit on the sidelines when it comes to doing things. People like that, even if the People's Commune gives them more advantages, they won't have great prospects."

	The class was over, and the people dispersed. Mom talked and laughed with everyone, and sent them all the way to the gate. The people going back illuminated the road with flashlights, and silvery beams and laughter rang out everywhere. Mom watched their backs for a long time before calling me back to the house. As she walked, she said with great emotion:

	"Raising pigs is a technical job, but also a meticulous job, and it's suitable for women. However, there are two key points. One is that you have to master new technologies. Now it's a collective pig farm, unlike in the past when one family raised just a few pigs. Without new methods, you can't make it work. Also, just having technology isn't enough. People who raise pigs have to love pigs. For example, if women treat the commune's pigs like they treat their own children, it would be strange if they didn't raise them well!"

	Back in the room, I thought that this time, my mother and I could talk. Unexpectedly, after she had arranged everything, she said, "Baosen, you're tired from the day, go to sleep!" and walked out again with the wind lamp on the table.

	How could I stay there by myself? So I put on my clothes and followed Mom out of the house.

	The moon had already set, the stars were twinkling, and a cool breeze was blowing. Mom held the wind lamp high, walking slowly along each row and each pig pen, carefully checking. A gust of wind blew, sweeping the fallen leaves on the ground and shaking the fire bead in the lamp. In the dim light, I saw a strand of Mom's gray hair fluttering, and a pair of eyes shining...

    妈妈
    浩然
    日头落山，门儿锁着，不知妈妈到那儿去了。我望着那把亮光光的黄铜锁，心里不住地犯嘀咕：妈妈真的到队里去养猪了吗？养猪是一个苦差事，黑夜白天要忙，风里雨里也不能歇，她那么大年纪了，身子骨又不好，能行吗？我若不是修水库去了，说什么也得拦下她。
    我这么想着，正要往外走，妈妈却气喘吁吁地跑回来了。
    “宝森，哎呀呀，妈妈可把你想坏了。哟，黑了，胖了，过集体生活真能壮人哪！”妈妈两手紧紧地抓着我的肩膀，上下打量着我。
    我也望着她。才几个月，她头上的灰白的头发好像稀疏了，刻在脸上的皱纹也显得多了。我说：“您好像瘦了。”
      “傻孩子，你可知道，咱们队里那群猪可肥了！”她笑嘻嘻地说着，松开抓着我的手，缕了缕头发，晃了晃肩膀，像是对我显示，她一点儿也不弱。接着，她越加兴奋地说：“宝森，这回妈妈可遂心如愿了。做姑娘的时候，我就喜欢养猪。可是咱们这边靠山，种山坡地不使粪，不习惯养猪、从嫁到这儿，我就跟猪分手了。这回呀，光咱们这个生产队就有三个养猪场，家家也都养了猪，我可有事干了！队长还硬说我有经验，拉我当技术员、养猪场长，咱那是个材料呀！干就干呗！人家瞧得起我，我能打坠坠？”
    她那股高兴劲儿立刻传染了我，预备见面时对她讲的话，再也说不出口。
    “刚才我从保管股领了一点儿玉米骨头，轧轧可以当猪的饲料。增产节约嘛，就得多找门路。”她扭转了话题，随即扯着我说：“我正愁弄不动，你来帮我一把。”
    一辆小推车停在门口外边，车子上跨着两只大筐子，筐子里边装着满满上尖的玉米骨。她拉着，我推着，一直往西走。到了养猪场，卸了车，我正准备往回走，妈妈却喊住我说：“宝森啦，妈妈没时间陪你呆在家里，往后也没功夫照顾你，依我说，干脆你也搬来跟妈住吧！”
    我心里想，放着挺好的家不住，跑这儿孤孤单单地干啥，我又不是饲养员。但是，当我正视着妈妈那期待的眼光时，我无论如何也说不出反对她的话。看样子，她老人家真的要在养猪场干下去了。
    妈妈见我犹豫就用非常亲切的口吻说道：“宝森哪，妈妈真离不开这些猪了。我们这个场是个繁殖场，可是个重要的工作呀！这个场从动第一锨土修建，我就来了；这些母猪都是我喂的第一瓢，是我赶它们交配，是我替它们接生，又是我亲手把养大了的小猪崽交给社员们的。如今全管理区，那个队没有我们这儿出产的猪崽？所有丰产田的肥料也都有我们这个场里出的……反正，妈妈不能离开这儿了；可也离不开你呀，你搬过来，两全其美，好不好？”
    我还有什么话讲呢？只好点点头。
    妈妈越发高兴了，领着我参观她们的猪圈，兴致勃勃地介绍这里的猪种，这里的环境卫生，这里的新法饲养；间或，她又亲热地跟那些向她摇头摆尾、哼哼乱叫的肥猪说句什么话。每介绍一段，都要停下来，向我问一句“怎么样”，当我点点头时，她又忍不住笑呵呵地自己先夸几声：“就是好，就是好！”参观完毕，她像是又想起什么重要事情，拉我跟她回房子里去。
    她跳上炕，从墙上一块吊挂着的木板上拿下一本揉得不像样子的书，递给我：“这是我在饲养员训练班领来的。看了好几遍，有一半字都不识得。你这一来就好了，我们聘请你当教员，每天上课给我们讲上一段儿。”
  我接过来翻一下，上边都是一些专门性的经验方法：“我一门不通，怎么给人家讲课呀？”
    妈妈说：“不要紧，你就按着上边给我念。你念我听，我懂了，由我来讲。待会儿，我们就要上课了，你看看吧。”
    果然，吃过饭，陆陆续续，不大工夫就来了一屋子人。有年轻的媳妇，也有十几岁的姑娘，还有几个跟我妈妈年纪差不多的老太太。其中有的我认识，有的是外村人。说说笑笑，顿时间把个挺安静的养猪场搞得热热闹闹。
    妈妈带上老花镜，对众人说：“到齐了，咱们上课。”这时我才发现，妈身边的墙上，靠着一扇门板子，上面涂了锅底黑，大概就是当黑板用的了。
    妈妈立在众人面前开口说：“今天还得从我肚子里掏，明天就按着书本讲，我来了老师啦！”说着，她从口袋里掏出半截儿粉笔头，两只手指头捉着，面向黑板，拉开架势。当她写完、闪到一边，我才看清楚，原来她画了一只又肥又大的母猪。
    妈妈搓着手里的粉笔沫开口了：“今天我讲母猪发情和交配。”接着，她手指点着图，就讲开了。
    “嗤——嗤”“嘻嘻”妇女们有的笑起来了，有的把脑袋垂到胸脯子上。
    妈妈发火了，在她跟前长这么大，我第一次见到她同外姓人发火：
  “你们这是怎么啦？笑什么？呵！是前几天我亲口跟队长说的，我说修大水库缺劳动力，快把养猪场多换些女人吧，这个活儿适合我们干，腾出一些男劳力去修水库。舌头磨疼了，人家才答应要你们来。看看，还没让你们动手，一听听就这样扭扭??，往后的大事情可怎么靠你们做？”
    料不到，她的话那么有动员力量。妇女们，一个个抬起头，认真、严肃地听她讲下去。
    妈妈笑了：“对，这样就对了。我是不喜欢成天价皱着眉头、见着煮饺子都不笑的人。眼下的日子像火炭，越烧越旺盛，你可有什么愁的？可是，该说笑说笑，该正经就得郑重其事。我们不能光是口头上喊男女平等，一干事情就自动坐坡，那样的人，人民公社再给她点优越性，她也没有大出息。”
    课讲完了，人们散去。妈妈跟众人说说笑笑，一直送出大门口。回去的人，打着手电照着路，遍地里银光道道笑声朗朗。妈妈望着她们的背影站了许久，才招呼我回房子。一面走着，她很感慨地说：
  “养猪这个事情，是个技术活，也是个细致活，妇女做合适。不过，有两个节骨眼。一个是得掌握新技术，如今是集体养猪场，不像过去一家养那么一口，没有新法儿可玩不转；还有，光有技术也不行，养猪的人得对猪爱，比方说，妇女们都像心疼孩子那样对待公社的猪，不把猪养好那才怪哩！”
    回到屋里，我心想这回，我们母子可以谈谈了。不料她把一切都安排好之后，说了声“宝森，你一天够累的了，睡吧！”提着桌子上的风灯又走出去了。
    我自己那里呆得住？就又披上衣服，相跟着妈妈走出屋。
    月亮已经落下山去，星斗闪闪，凉风阵阵。妈妈高高地举起风灯，沿着每一排、每一个猪圈，慢慢地走着，仔细地查看。一股风吹过来，扫着地下的落叶，摇着灯里的火珠。在昏暗的灯光里，我看到妈妈的一缕灰发在飘动，一双眼睛在闪光……（附图片）
