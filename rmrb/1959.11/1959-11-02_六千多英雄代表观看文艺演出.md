Xinhua News Agency, November 1st - Over six thousand representatives attending the National Conference of Heroes watched a splendid joint performance by art troupes from the capital and other regions at the Great Hall of the People tonight. The brightly lit Great Hall was filled with a joyous atmosphere celebrating the Great Leap Forward.

Amidst the rapid sound of gongs and drums, warm and heartfelt singing arose. This was the three-hundred-person chorus "Salute to Advanced Producers" jointly performed by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Workers' Song and Dance Troupe, the Tianjin Municipal Workers' Amateur Art Delegation, the Coal Miners' Amateur Art Troupe, and the Benxi City Drama Troupe, among six units. As the singing grew louder and louder, suddenly the lights in the Great Hall shone brightly, and the choir members ran off the stage to present flowers to the heroes. At this moment, applause thundered throughout the hall, and the heroes and performers shouted slogans in unison: "Go all out, aim high, and build the motherland with greater, faster, better, and more economical results!" The emotions of the heroes and actors were completely intertwined.

The "Farewell My Concubine" performed by the famous Peking Opera artist Mei Lanfang and the famous painted-face actor Yuan Shihai was one of the most popular programs. Most of the six thousand heroes participating in this evening's performance were seeing Mei Lanfang's opera for the first time, and it was also the first time Mei Lanfang performed for so many heroes. The veteran artist said excitedly, "It is the most glorious and happiest thing to be able to perform for so many heroes!"

Also present tonight were Vice Chairmen Lin Boqu, Shen Junru, Chen Shutong, and Lin Feng; Vice Premier Bo Yibo; Chief Procurator of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng; Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Bao Erhan; Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Liu Ningyi; and heads of various central departments.

At this moment, the entire audience stood up, and the thunderous applause lasted for a long time.
