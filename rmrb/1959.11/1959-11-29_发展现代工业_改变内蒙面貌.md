Developing modern industry and realizing socialist industrialization is the only way for the construction and development of our motherland. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Without industry, there is no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." In the political report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi at the First Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, it was pointed out: "If the various minority nationalities are to develop into modern nationalities, in addition to carrying out social reforms, the fundamental key is to develop modern industry in their regions." "All industries in minority areas, whether they are state-owned industries under the central government or local industries, must pay attention to helping minority nationalities form their own working class and train their own scientific and technical cadres and enterprise management cadres. Only in this way can the development of minority nationalities in all aspects reach the modern level relatively quickly." The practice of industrial construction in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region for more than ten years has fully confirmed that while successfully carrying out social reforms in minority areas, developing modern industry is the fundamental issue for enabling minority nationalities to develop into modern nationalities.

Although Inner Mongolia is vast and rich in resources, during the reactionary ruling period, what could be counted as modern industry was almost zero. At the beginning of liberation, there were only about nine thousand employees. Due to the underdevelopment of industry, industrial products relied on supplies from other places, and the lives of people of all ethnic groups were in a state of extreme hardship. After the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1947, while promoting national regional autonomy, the Party put the issue of how to build the autonomous region and change the historically backward situation on its agenda. Especially after the founding of the People's Republic of China, for the past ten years, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the glorious light of the Party's ethnic policy, and with the vigorous assistance of fraternal regions, the scale of industrial construction in the autonomous region has gradually expanded, and some modern industries have been initially established, thus bringing about profound changes in the face of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

These profound changes are mainly reflected in: the improvement of the industrial level, which has brought about major changes in the national economy. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the history of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region not producing iron and steel was ended. On the basis of the development of small-scale indigenous methods, six relatively fixed medium and small-sized iron and steel smelting bases were established, becoming the backbone of the local iron and steel industry. The construction progress of Baotou Steel (Baogang) was one year ahead of the original plan. The country's largest No. 1 blast furnace produced iron before National Day, and will soon produce steel and steel products. The gradual commissioning of Baogang will play an increasingly important role in the country's socialist construction. Driven by the iron and steel industry, the coal industry has developed rapidly, and its technical equipment is gradually improving. Several emerging coal production bases are being built. In addition to the two large-scale modern machinery factories built by the state in the autonomous region, the local machinery industry has more than 2,000 machine tools and forging equipment. In the past, it could only carry out repairs and manufacture small agricultural implements. Now it can produce medium and large-sized machinery for metallurgy, mining, power generation, agriculture and animal husbandry. The Inner Mongolia Greater Khingan Range forest industry has become one of the largest timber production and supply bases in the country. In the past ten years, it has shipped more than 11 million cubic meters of timber, strongly supporting the production and construction of the country and the autonomous region. It is now developing towards comprehensive utilization. Modern wool textile, leather, dairy, meat and grain processing industries have been established. Industries that the autonomous region lacked, such as petroleum and chemical industries, are also gradually being established and developed from small to large, from indigenous to modern. The level of mechanization and semi-mechanization of handicraft cooperatives (factories) has been greatly improved. The production of daily-use industrial products has also increased significantly in terms of variety and quantity. After rectification, there are still over ten thousand banner, county, and commune industries. These industries vigorously serve rural and pastoral areas. Due to the development of modern industry, the situation in history where only raw materials were produced without finished products is changing. The people are able to process and produce many production and daily necessities themselves. Some special ethnic products that are needed have also been or are being gradually resolved.

The transportation industry has developed rapidly. Over the past ten years, the state has built three new trunk railways and four branch railways and more than forty dedicated lines in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with a total length of 1,586 kilometers. Now the total mileage of railways open to traffic in the region has reached more than 3,400 kilometers (excluding forest narrow-gauge railways), which is twice that of the time of liberation. Railways pass through the nine leagues and cities directly under the autonomous region. Things that could not be transported in the past are now being transported out; a dead treasure has become a living treasure. By the end of 1958, a total of 18,000 kilometers of highways had been built in the region, and there were nearly 800 postal and telecommunications service agencies. All people's communes and more than 80% of production brigades can receive mail. Now, a transportation network and a postal and telecommunications network centered on railways, including highways, civil aviation, and inland river transportation, has been initially formed throughout the region. The historically inconvenient transportation situation is gone forever.

A large number of Mongolian and other minority workers in the region have grown up. By the end of 1958, there were 20,472 Mongolian and other minority employees in the region's industrial, construction, and transportation sectors. The cultural, scientific and technological levels of the people of all ethnic groups have also greatly improved. In the past, there were not only no universities, but also very few secondary vocational schools. Now there are 29 vocational schools of various types in the region in industry and transportation alone, with more than 12,300 students. With the growth and expansion of the national working class, the ideological influence of the working class is gradually expanding among the people of all ethnic groups. Especially after the movement of vigorously developing industry and making steel in 1958, the confidence of the people of all ethnic groups in building socialism has been further strengthened.

The rapid development of industrial construction has further changed ethnic relations and promoted political unity among ethnic groups. In the past, Mongolians were very afraid of Han people entering pastoral areas to explore and mine. Now this situation has changed. In industrial construction, people of all ethnic groups have directly benefited in their economic lives. In particular, workers of all ethnic groups have realized the importance of helping and cooperating with each other in their common labor. From their own economic interests and common needs, they have realized the necessity of close unity among ethnic groups, thereby eliminating some of the ideological gaps and doubts that originally existed, and they love the Party and the motherland more and actively participate in the construction of the autonomous region.

Over the past ten years, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has accumulated a lot of experience in industrial construction. There are successful experiences and also failed experiences. Adhering to the Party's general line for socialist construction, strengthening the Party's leadership, implementing political command, following the mass line, and engaging in technological revolution are all indispensable for doing a good job in industrial construction. In addition to this, based on my personal experience in the work over the past few years, I will talk about the following points:

(1) The industrial construction of the autonomous region must resolutely obey the unified plan of the country and meet the requirements of the entire country as a whole. The autonomous region is an integral part of the unified family of the motherland. The industrial construction of the autonomous region is planned from the overall interests of the country and the fundamental interests of the country, combined with the actual situation of the autonomous region. Over the past few years, we have resolutely implemented this spirit, so that the industrial construction of the autonomous region has achieved smooth development.

(2) We must conscientiously implement the established set of "walking on two legs" policy of the central government, and adhere to the principles of adapting to local conditions, highlighting key points, relying on the masses, and spreading out across the board.

Practice over the past few years has proved that starting from reality and walking on two legs, especially running large, medium and small enterprises simultaneously, and combining modern and indigenous production methods, has made local industry develop richly and colorfully.

(3) Industry must support agriculture and animal husbandry. Only by developing agriculture and animal husbandry can there be sufficient industrial raw materials and can the market for industrial products be expanded. Developing industry and supporting the high-speed development of agriculture and animal husbandry also paves the way for the development of industry.

(4) The transportation industry must keep up accordingly. In recent years, due to the rapid development of industrial construction, transportation has become increasingly prominent. Therefore, transportation has become a critical issue for the development of industrial construction. The way to solve the transportation problem must be to resolutely implement the policy of "walking on two legs." It is necessary to give full play to the role of mass transportation tools and vigorously engage in mass technological innovation and technological revolution movements to improve transportation tools. The autonomous region's movement to build vehicles and ships on a large scale and engage in mass short-distance transportation this year has achieved certain results.

(5) We must unremittingly implement the Party's ethnic policy and oppose nationalistic tendencies in industrial construction. We must oppose both the great Han chauvinistic ideology that disregards regional characteristics and ethnic requirements, only considers economic accounts and not political accounts, and opposes the distribution of industrial sites in sparsely populated areas; and we must also oppose the narrow-minded nationalistic ideology that disregards reality, prefers backwardness, and does not seek progress, and opposes the establishment of industries in pastoral areas. We have continuously carried out education on the Party's ethnic policy, and arranged the industrial construction of the autonomous region according to the central government's policy of developing industry in ethnic areas, thereby gaining the support of all ethnic groups.

At the same time, in the process of industrial construction in the autonomous region, we resolutely oppose right-leaning conservative ideas. Some people lack confidence in the autonomous region's ability to quickly establish modern industry. They believe that Inner Mongolia is vast and sparsely populated, transportation is inconvenient, the climate is cold, ethnic groups are complex, and technology is lacking. In a word: the conditions are not good, and modern industry cannot be developed. This is the so-called "Inner Mongolia Lagging Theory" (also known as the one-sided conditions theory). This view is wrong and is not conducive to the socialist construction of the country and the autonomous region. The Party has refuted this right-leaning conservative erroneous view. As a result, the industrial construction in our region, like the whole country, is developing greatly every year.

(6) Strengthening enterprise management and strictly implementing economic accounting are the keys to running industrial enterprises well. We regard the problem of opposing the ideological style of neglecting economic accounting and continuously improving the level of enterprise management as a regular task. As a result, in recent years, the industrial enterprise management in the autonomous region has been continuously improved, product costs have been gradually reduced, and product quality has been gradually improved, accumulating a large amount of construction funds for the country. In the future, we must continue to improve the management level of enterprises.

Over the past ten years, although the industrial construction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved great achievements, many things are just the first step, and more important tasks are yet to come. The current task is to continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies, exert full effort, and further set off a high tide of the increase production and practice economy movement under the excellent situation of the continued leap forward, in order to complete and overfulfill this year's plan tasks, welcome the continued leap forward in 1960, and strive to push the various ethnic groups of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region towards the ranks of modern ethnic groups!

    发展现代工业　改变内蒙面貌
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记　杨植霖
    发展现代工业，实现社会主义工业化，是我们祖国建设发展的必由之路。毛泽东同志说过：“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”在中国共产党第八届全国代表大会第一次会议上，刘少奇同志所作的政治报告中指出：“各少数民族要发展成为现代民族，除进行社会改革以外，根本的关键是要在他们的地区发展现代工业。”“凡是在少数民族地区的工业，无论是中央国营工业或者是地方工业，都必须注意帮助少数民族形成自己的工人阶级，培养自己的科学技术干部和企业管理干部。只有这样，少数民族在各方面的发展才能比较快地达到现代的水平。”从内蒙古自治区十多年来的工业建设实践中，完全证实了在少数民族地区胜利地实现社会改革的同时，发展现代工业，是使少数民族发展为现代民族的根本问题。
    内蒙古地区虽然地大物博，但是在反动统治时期，可以算做现代工业的，几乎等于零。解放初期全部职工不过九千来人。由于工业不发达，工业产品都靠外地供给，各族人民的生活处于极端困苦的状态中，1947年内蒙古自治区建立之后，党在推行民族区域自治的同时，就把如何建设自治区、改变历史上遗留下来的这种落后状况，提到自己的议事日程上来了。特别在中华人民共和国成立后，十年来，内蒙古自治区各族人民在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，在各兄弟地区的大力帮助下，自治区的工业建设的规模逐渐扩大起来，初步建立了一些现代工业，从而使内蒙古自治区的面貌发生了深刻的变化。
    这些深刻变化主要表现在：工业水平的提高，使国民经济发生了重大变化。经过1958年的大跃进，结束了内蒙古自治区不产钢铁的历史，在小土群发展的基础上，建立起六个比较定型的中小型钢铁冶炼基地，成为地方钢铁工业的骨干。包钢建设进度比原计划提前了一年。祖国最大的一号高炉已于国庆节前出铁，不久就要生产钢和钢材了。包钢的逐步投入生产，将对国家社会主义建设起着越来越大的作用。在钢铁工业的带动下，煤炭工业迅速发展，技术装备也在逐步提高，几个新兴的煤炭生产基地正在着手建立。机械工业除了国家在自治区兴建的两个现代化的大型机械厂以外，地方机械工业拥有各种机床和锻压设备二千余台，过去只能进行修配和制造小型农具等，现在已能生产中型和较大型的冶金、矿山、发电设备和农牧业等机械了。内蒙古大兴安岭森林工业已成为祖国最大的木材生产供应基地之一，十年间，共运出木材一千数百多万立米，有力地支援了祖国和自治区的生产建设。现在正在向综合利用的阶段发展。现代化的毛纺、皮革、乳品、肉类和粮食加工工业已经建立起来，自治区缺门的工业，如石油、化学工业等，也正在由小到大，由土到洋逐步建立和发展起来。手工业社（厂）的机械化、半机械化水平已有很大提高。日用工业品的生产，在品种、数量方面也有很大增长。旗、县、公社工业经过整顿还有一万数千个。这些工业有力地为农村牧区服务。由于现代化工业的发展，历史上形成的那种只产原料不产成品的局面正在发生变化，人民的许多生产、生活用品能够自己加工生产了，一些特殊需要的民族用品，也已经或正在逐步得到解决。
    交通运输事业有了迅速的发展。十年来，国家在内蒙古自治区境内新建了三条铁路干线和四条铁路支线及四十多条专用线，全长一千五百八十六公里。现在全区铁路通车里程共达三千四百多公里（不包括森林窄轨铁路），等于解放时的两倍。自治区直辖的九个盟市境内都有铁路通过，过去运不出来的东西，现在运出来了；死宝变成了活宝。到1958年底，全区共修建公路一万八千公里，邮电服务机构将近八百处，各个人民公社和80％以上的生产大队都可通邮，现在全区以铁路为中心的包括公路、民航、内河航运的交通运输网和邮电网已初步形成。历史上所谓交通不便的状况已一去不复返了。
    蒙古民族和区内少数民族的工人阶级大批成长起来。到1958年底，全区工业、基建、交通战线上，有蒙古族和区内其它少数民族固定职工二万零四百七十二人。各民族人民的文化科学技术水平也有了很大的提高。过去不仅没有大专学校，中等专业学校也少得可怜。现在全区仅工业、交通方面就有各类专业学校二十九所，在校学生一万二千三百余人。随着民族工人阶级的成长壮大，在各民族人民中间，工人阶级的思想影响正在逐步扩大，特别是经过1958年大办工业、大炼钢铁的运动，各民族人民建设社会主义的信心更增强了。
    工业建设的迅速发展，进一步改变了民族关系，促进了各民族政治上的团结。过去蒙古人很害怕汉人进牧区勘察开矿，现在这种情况改变了。在工业建设中各族人民由于在经济生活上直接得到利益，特别是各民族工人在共同劳动中认识到互相帮助、互相协作的重要性，他们从切身的经济利益和共同的需要中，体会到民族之间亲密团结的必要性，从而消除了原来存在的某些思想隔阂与疑惧，更加热爱党、热爱祖国、积极参加自治区的建设。
    十多年来，内蒙古自治区进行工业建设的经验是很多的。其中有成功的经验，也有失败的经验。坚持党的社会主义建设总路线，加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，走群众路线，搞技术革命等，都是做好工业建设必不可少的。除此之外，仅就我个人这几年在工作中的体会，谈如下几点：
      （一）自治区的工业建设，必须坚决服从国家的统一计划，合乎全国一盘棋的要求。自治区是统一的祖国大家庭的一个组成部分，自治区的工业建设是从全国整体利益和国家的根本利益出发，结合自治区的实际情况加以考虑而规划的。几年来我们坚决贯彻了这个精神，因而使得自治区的工业建设获得顺利发展。
      （二）必须认真贯彻执行中央既定的一整套两条腿走路的方针，坚持执行因地制宜，重点突出，依靠群众，遍地开花的原则。
    几年来的实践证明：从实际出发，用两条腿走路，特别是大、中、小型企业并举，洋法生产与土法生产并举，使地方工业丰富多采地发展了起来。
      （三）工业必须支援农牧业。只有发展了农牧业，才能有充足的工业原料，才会扩大工业品的市场。发展工业，支援农牧业的高速度发展，也就是给工业的发展开辟道路。
      （四）交通运输事业必须相应地跟上。近几年来，由于工业建设的飞速发展，交通运输显得越来越突出。因此交通运输就成为发展工业建设的一个带有关键性的问题。解决交通运输问题的道路，必须是坚决贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针。必须充分发挥群众运输工具的作用，大搞群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，改进运输工具。自治区在今年开展的大造车船和大搞群众性的短途运输的运动，已经收到一定效果。
      （五）要坚持不懈地贯彻党的民族政策，反对工业建设中的民族主义倾向。既反对不顾地区特点和民族要求，只算经济账，不算政治账，反对在人口少的地方分布工业点的大民族主义思想；又要反对不顾实际，宁愿落后，不求前进，反对在牧区建立工业的狭隘民族主义思想。我们不断地进行了党的民族政策的教育，根据中央在民族地区发展工业的方针，安排自治区的工业建设，因而得到各民族的拥护。
    与此同时，在自治区工业建设过程中，坚决反对右倾保守思想。有些人对自治区能够迅速建立起现代工业信心不足，他们认为内蒙古地广人稀，交通不便，气候寒冷，民族复杂，技术缺乏，一句话：条件不好，不能发展现代工业。这就是所谓“内蒙落后论”（又叫片面的条件论）的观点。这种观点是错误的，是不利于国家和自治区的社会主义建设的。党批驳了这种右倾保守的错误观点。因而使我区的工业建设和全国一样，每年都在大大地向前发展。
      （六）加强企业管理，严格经济核算，是办好工业企业的关键。我们把反对忽视经济核算的思想作风，不断提高企业管理水平的问题，当作一项经常性的任务。因而几年来，自治区工业企业管理工作不断改进，产品成本逐步降低，产品质量逐步提高，为国家积累了大量建设资金。今后仍然要不断提高企业的管理水平。
    十多年来，内蒙古自治区的工业建设，虽然取得了巨大成就，但很多事情只是刚刚迈开了第一步，更重要的任务还在后头。当前的任务是在继续跃进的大好形势下，继续反对右倾，鼓足干劲，进一步掀起增产节约运动的高潮，为完成和超额完成今年的计划任务，迎接1960年的继续跃进，为把内蒙古自治区的各个民族向现代民族的行列推向前进而努力奋斗！
