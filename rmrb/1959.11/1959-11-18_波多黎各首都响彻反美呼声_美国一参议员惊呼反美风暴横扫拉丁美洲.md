Xinhua News Agency, November 17th, San Juan dispatch: An anti-American movement has recently erupted in the Puerto Rican capital. In recent days, leaflets condemning American colonialism have been found in all public places in Puerto Rico, and slogans such as "Down with American imperialism," "Yankees insult Puerto Rico," and "Yankees are enemies of your country" have been written on the walls of public buildings. A bomb explosion also occurred in front of the American International Club. One of the posted slogans cheered the national hero "Long Live Albizu Campos." Campos was arrested by the United States in 1954.

This anti-American movement was triggered by the blatant insult and arrogant colonialist attitude of the President of the Navy League of the United States, Frank Jameson, towards the Puerto Rican Minister of Justice. Not long ago, at a meeting held by the Navy League of the United States, the Puerto Rican Minister of Justice criticized the "big stick" policy towards Latin American countries formulated by one of the founders of the Navy League of the United States, former US President Roosevelt. He also opposed the leaders of the Navy League of the United States referring to Puerto Rico as an American "possession" when mentioning it. Following the speech by the Puerto Rican Minister of Justice, Frank Jameson even provocatively and insultingly said that the United States should implement a "bigger big stick policy" towards Latin American countries. He also viciously attacked the people's democratic movements in Panama and Cuba.

The aforementioned provocative actions of Jameson, President of the Navy League of the United States, and his colonialist attitude towards the Puerto Rican people, aroused great indignation. According to a report in the Puerto Rican "Justice News" on the 14th, the Puerto Rican University Students' Union for Independence issued a statement declaring that the Navy League of the United States and its president, Jameson, are "unwelcome." The statement said, "The Navy League of the United States is an organization purely with warmongering and imperialist purposes," its founders are the "designers" of the imperialist "big stick policy" against Latin American countries, and Jameson advocates implementing a policy of armed intervention in Latin American countries.

Xinhua News Agency, November 17th, Washington dispatch: US Senator Smathers spoke on the 14th in an alarmed tone about the increasingly fierce anti-American wave in Latin America. He said that discontent is sweeping across Latin America like a storm. Smathers blamed the US government for creating enemies in Latin America. He said that although there is a great deal of trade between Latin America and the United States, the relationship between the United States and Latin American countries is weakening and declining to "the lowest level in history." He complained that the US government had failed to take "positive steps that could salvage this situation."

### 波多黎各首都响彻反美呼声  美国一参议员惊呼反美风暴横扫拉丁美洲

    波多黎各首都响彻反美呼声
    美国一参议员惊呼反美风暴横扫拉丁美洲
    据新华社17日讯　圣胡安消息：波多黎各首都最近爆发了反美运动。连日来，波多黎各的各公共场所到处发现谴责美国殖民主义的传单，并在公共建筑物的墙上书写了“打倒美帝国主义”、“美国佬侮辱了波多黎各”和“美国佬是你的国家的敌人”等标语。在美国国际俱乐部门前还发生了炸弹爆炸事件。在张贴的标语中有一条欢呼民族英雄“阿耳维苏·坎皮斯万岁”。坎皮斯是在1954年被美国逮捕的。
    这次反美运动是由美国海军联谊会主席弗兰克·詹姆森对波多黎各司法部长的公然侮辱和蛮横无理的殖民主义态度所引起的。不久前波多黎各司法部长在美国海军联谊会举行的一次会议上曾抨击美国海军联谊会创始人之一、美国前总统罗斯福所制定的对拉丁美洲国家的大棒政策，并且对美国海军联谊会的领导者们在提到波多黎各时把它称作美国的“所有物”表示反对。弗兰克·詹姆森在波多黎各司法部长的发言后竟然挑衅和侮辱说，美国要对拉丁美洲国家实行“更大的大棒政策”。他还恶毒地攻击了巴拿马和古巴的人民民主运动。
    美国海军联谊会主席詹姆森的上述挑衅行动和对波多黎各人民采取的殖民主义态度，激起了极大的义愤。据波多黎各“公正报”14日报道，波多黎各大学生争取独立联合会发表声明，宣布美国海军联谊会和它的主席詹姆森是“不受欢迎的”。声明说，“美国海军联谊会是纯粹抱着好战目的和帝国主义目的的组织”，它的创始者是反对拉丁美洲国家的帝国主义“大棒政策”的“设计者”，而詹姆森主张对拉丁美洲国家实行武装干涉政策。
    据新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：美国参议员斯马瑟斯14日以惶恐的语调谈到拉丁美洲日益猛烈的反美浪潮。他说，不满情绪像风暴般横扫整个拉丁美洲。斯马瑟斯责怪美国政府在拉丁美洲树立了敌人。他说，虽然拉丁美洲和美国之间的贸易来往很大，美国和拉丁美洲国家之间的关系却日益削弱，下降到“历史上最低的水平”。他抱怨美国政府未能采取“能够挽救这个情况的积极步骤”。
