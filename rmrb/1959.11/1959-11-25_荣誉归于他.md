    Honor Belongs to Him
    By Our Reporter, É'ěrdémùtú
    Xing Shuhua, a well-known pig-raising expert in Ningcheng County, Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia, already has half-white hair, but he is still full of vigor, and his pig-raising skills have made him famous.
    Xing Shuhua started raising pigs for others in his childhood. The long years have given him a deep affection for pigs. As he said, he falls in love with the sight of small, exquisite piglets and those fat, big-eared hogs; when visiting relatives, he always remembers to rush to the pigsty for a careful look.
    After the establishment of the commune, he became a feeder. To him, this was such a noble position! He said he would set an example for the young people. Since he took on the job of pig feeder, the pig farm, which originally had only twelve pigs, now has 216 pigs in the pen. Adding the 249 pigs sold to the state and distributed to commune members for feeding in 1958, the actual number of pigs raised reached 465, worth more than 11,300 yuan. At the same time, a large amount of manure, tens of thousands of catties, is provided annually to support agricultural production.
    In his work as a feeder, the old man's care for the pigs is truly meticulous. When the piglets are first born, he pays attention to distributing them to fixed teats according to their strength. According to him, the teats on the sow's chest have better and richer milk, while the teats behind have lighter milk. In order to ensure that both strong and weak piglets develop relatively evenly, he gives the weaker ones the front teats and the stronger ones the back teats, and he often fiddles with the piglets to familiarize them with the teats, and massages the sow's teats to promote lactation. From then on, the big pigs and small pigs wag their tails when they see him.
    Xing Shuhua often says: "People don't like to eat leftovers, and pigs don't like to eat leftover food either," "People like to take baths, but it's not okay to keep people soaked in water all day long. Pigs are the same. They like to wallow in puddles, but it's not comfortable to be in mud and water all day long." He always gives each pig just the right amount of feed, avoiding the situation where the later pigs eat leftovers. He always sweeps the pigsty clean and keeps the pig pens dry. In the dog days, he digs a puddle beside the pen for the pigs to bathe in. Last spring, the pigs he raised suffered from a disease. The pigs, which were fed fat, just wouldn't eat or drink and were listless. The old man took care of the sick pigs day and night, hugging one pig and stroking it for a while, and then embracing another pig, feeding it a few mouthfuls from a food bowl. Seeing him so diligent, the commune members praised him, saying, "The old man truly loves pigs like his own children."
    Hard work has brought lofty honor.
    Last year, he attended the Ningcheng County Model Veterans and Labor Model Conference; this year, he attended the Autonomous Region's Conference of Representatives of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Military Dependents, Disabled Soldiers, Demobilized Soldiers, and Activists in Socialist Construction.

    荣誉归于他
    本报记者　额尔德木图
    内蒙古昭乌达盟宁城县闻名的养猪能手邢树华，头发已经半白了，可是人老志不衰，养猪养得好出了名。
    邢树华从童年开始就给人家放猪，漫长的岁月使他对猪有了深厚的感情，正如他所说的，见到水秀玲玲的小猪和那些肥头大耳的肥猪就爱上心头；走亲戚串门子也总是忘不了奔往猪圈，细心看看。
    公社成立后，他担任饲养员。对他来说，这是多么崇高的职务呵！他说要干出个样子给青年们看看。从他担任养猪饲养员以来，原来只有十二头猪的养猪场，到现在圈存有了二百十六头，加上1958年卖给国家和分配给社员喂养的二百四十九头，实际发展的头数达到四百六十五头，价值一万一千三百多元，同时每年以大量万斤猪粪支援了农业生产。
    在担任饲养员的工作中，老人对猪的关心，真是无微不至。当猪崽刚产下来，他就注意分强弱给固定奶头。据他说，母猪胸下的奶头好奶汁较浓，其后的奶头奶汁较淡，为了使强弱猪崽都得比较平衡的发育，他就给弱的吃前边的奶头，给强的吃后面的奶头，并经常摆弄小猪熟悉奶头，给母猪按摩奶头借以催乳。从此，大猪小猪见他就摇头摆尾。
    邢树华常说：“人不爱吃剩饭，猪也不愿意吃剩食”、“人爱洗澡，可是整天叫人泡在水里就不行，猪也一样，喜欢到水坑里打个滚，但是整天在泥水里也不舒坦”。他总是把每口猪的饲料给得正合适，避免后到的猪吃剩食；他总是把猪圈扫得干干净净，保持猪栏的干燥。伏天里，在圈边挖个水坑供猪洗澡。去年春天，他饲养的猪闹了一场病，喂得肥肥的猪，就是不吃不喝，无精打彩。老人不分昼夜的照看病猪，一会儿抱起这个猪扶摸一阵，一会儿又搂起另一只猪，端着食盆喂几口。社员们看着他如此勤劳，都夸赞地说，“老汉真是爱猪如子”。
    勤劳带来了崇高的荣誉。
    去年他出席宁城县荣军模范会与劳模会；今年便出席了自治区烈属军属、荣军复员军人社会主义建设积极分子代表大会。
