Even When Heaven Doesn't Help, Sea Salt Still Has a Bumper Harvest
Introducing the Deeds of the Baijiakou Salt Plant in Fuzhou Bay, Liaoning

The Baijiakou Salt Plant is an advanced salt plant among the eight salt plants in Fuzhou Bay, Liaoning. This year, its crude salt production exceeded the annual plan by three months and four days ahead of schedule, an increase of 24.8% compared with the same period last year. The quality of the salt has also greatly improved compared with last year, with first-class salt accounting for 80% of the total output, second-class salt dropping to 20%, and third-class salt completely eliminated. No personal or liability accidents occurred, labor productivity increased by 41.75% compared with last year, and costs decreased by 34.28% compared with last year. In the first half of this year, the Baijiakou Salt Plant was rated as a Red Flag unit in the Dalian Light Industry System.

Did the bumper harvest of sea salt production at the Baijiakou Salt Plant this year come about because heaven helped? No. From January to September this year, there were twelve more rains than in the same period last year, and the rainfall increased by sixty-two millimeters. This is unfavorable to salt production, coupled with the shortage of labor and tools this year. Under such circumstances, achieving a bumper harvest is completely unimaginable in the eyes of conservatives. However, in fact, an even greater bumper harvest was achieved this year than in the Great Leap Forward of 1958. What is the reason?

Adhering to putting politics in command and vigorously launching mass movements is the decisive factor for the Baijiakou Salt Plant's great victory. Last winter and this spring, the Baijiakou Party General Branch implemented the policy of taking brine as the key link, and in January and February, it launched four battles for brine in a row, preparing a solid source of brine for the promotion of long-term crystallization this year. At that time, some people with conservative ideas became discouraged after building more than two hundred water storage ponds last winter. Some believed that "it is difficult to harvest ten thousand dan of grain without ten thousand acres of fields," meaning that it is better to fill more ponds than to make more brine, and they did not approve of the method of extracting salt from ice and making brine in deep water in winter. The Party General Branch held an on-site meeting in the First Production Team, which produced more brine and had a higher concentration, using the facts to educate the masses, criticizing the fear of difficulties, and pushing the mass movement of extracting salt from ice to a climax. In the severe cold weather, the workers put on ice skates and held iron shovels, breaking ice in 350,000 square meters. The Ninth Production Team took only two days to dig a two-hundred-meter-long water diversion ditch. Some workers went to the beach to make brine as soon as they heard the wind, even in the middle of the night. By January 20, 200,000 cubic meters of brine had been produced. In mid-February, the Party Committee's instruction to break through the brine barrier was implemented, and a competition of "increasing the amount of brine at each level and improving step by step" began. By the end of February, 90% of the brine production plan had been completed, and the amount of brine increased by 77.65% compared with last year. In mid-April, another brine competition was held, and all the workers beat the drums and chased after the victory. By April 20, the comprehensive storage volume of brine at all levels reached 800,000 cubic meters, an increase of three and a half times compared with the same period last year. In the past, there was often a shortage of brine during the peak production season, but this year, in May and June, the amount of brine stored increased by 160% compared with last year.

In July and August, rainfall was frequent, and some people showed fear of difficulties again. The Party General Branch promptly held an enlarged meeting to analyze the situation, take measures, make resolutions, and mobilize the workers to muster greater efforts in the face of greater difficulties. Then, the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was vigorously publicized and implemented, opposing right-leaning tendencies and encouraging greater efforts, and a vigorous upsurge immediately appeared in production. As of the end of September, more than 162,000 tons of crude salt had been produced, an increase of 26% compared with the same period last year; 370,000 cubic meters of brine had been cultivated, an increase of 198.3% compared with the same period last year; and the efficiency of workers repairing the beach increased by 25.1% compared with last year.

Right-leaning thoughts were criticized, mass movements became increasingly high, and the enthusiasm of the masses became greater and greater. In the past nine months, seventy-one on-site meetings, more than forty experience exchange meetings, and eleven competition meetings have been held successively, and the competition movement is rising day by day.

Technical innovation is the main content of the mass movement vigorously carried out by the Baijiakou Salt Plant. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the broad masses of workers have broken superstitions, emancipated their minds, and established a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. The Baijiakou Salt Plant has a large area, few workers, and insufficient equipment. On the other hand, the workers are enthusiastic and the climate conditions are relatively good. During the spring salting period in 1958, the Fuzhou Bay Salt Plant Party Committee decided to promote the advanced operation method of long-term crystallization and conducted a pilot project in Baijiakou. After more than one hundred days of testing, it was proved that the output could be increased by 30%, and the quality completely reached the standard of first-class salt.

Long-term crystallization is a revolutionary measure in salt production. In the past, the operation of sea salt crystallization was to rigidly adhere to the traditional habit of raking every three days, scraping every two days, raking when it rains, and scraping when it is overcast. The result of promoting long-term crystallization in 1958 proved that this is an advanced operation method, which also saves labor and electricity. However, when this operation method was first promoted, some people with conservative ideas held a skeptical attitude, saying: "If you want to implement this method, unless you put a cover on the salt field, it is a dream." After on-site meetings and debates, although most of the workers supported this new measure, there were still a few people who believed that long-term crystallization was "risky and requires good luck." In order to consolidate the confidence of the workers, the secretary personally took charge and strengthened on-site guidance and ideological education. In the first half of 1959, the production situation once again proved that long-term crystallization can not only be implemented, but also has a good effect. According to statistics, the output per hectare was 124.1 tons, an increase of 31.32% compared with 94.5 tons in the same period last year. Baijiakou has become the unit with the highest completion of the plan among the eight salt plants in Fuzhou Bay.

The implementation of long-term crystallization has greatly changed the concept of relying on heaven for food that exists among some of the masses. People have personally seen that the output and quality of long-term crystallization have improved. Generally, people have no doubt about the improvement of quality, but in terms of output, they have always believed that raking salt when it rains is safer than not raking it, and the salt in the pool counts when it is raked up. But in fact, taking the entire Fuzhou Bay plant as an example, the output of long-term crystallization is three tons more than that of crystallization ponds that are raked when it rains. From the unit output of the crystallization area, raking once increases the output per mu by 29.95% compared with raking three times. Long-term crystallization has also narrowed the difference between high and low yields. This year, the best group completed 110% of the plan, and the lowest also completed more than 80% of the plan. From March to April this year, the average salt raking was 2.2 times, and in May, the average salt raking was 3.3 times. From March to May, four to five fewer salt raking sessions were made than when long-term crystallization was not implemented, which basically changed the old habit of raking every three days and scraping every two days. In June, due to abnormal weather, an indefinite raking method was adopted to ensure that there were no losses during the rainy season. Due to the small number of salt raking sessions, labor was greatly saved. From April to May, five salt raking sessions were reduced, saving a total of 3,150 labor days. The workers personally experienced the benefits of long-term crystallization greatly reducing labor intensity. They said: "In the past, we ran out when it rained, but now we run home when it rains. As long as the brine is covered well before the rain, we can move the water after the rain, avoiding the rush of repeated irrigations in the past. It is really an unexpected good thing." With the implementation of long-term crystallization, the water depth was increased to more than five centimeters, and the erroneous concept that sunning water is not as good as sunning pool slabs was further corrected. The salt workers wrote many poems to praise long-term crystallization: Some wrote: "Long-term crystallization is good, the salt production is really a lot; long-term crystallization is good, the quality has greatly improved; long-term crystallization is good, saving labor and materials." This revolutionary technical innovation has further stimulated the creativity of the workers and masses and opened up a path for further changing the face of the salt field.

In the Baijiakou Salt Field, the large hao, which was used to rake salt in the past, has now been replaced by a rope-drawn salt raking machine.

All these technical innovations appeared last year and have been improved in this year's continued leap forward. The workers are not satisfied with this, and they are continuing to work hard to achieve semi-mechanization.

    老天不帮忙  海盐也丰收
    介绍辽宁复州湾白家口制盐场的事迹
    白家口制盐场是辽宁复州湾八个盐场中的先进盐场，今年原盐产量提前三个月零四天超额完成全年计划，比去年同期产量增长24.8％；盐的质量也比去年有很大提高，一等盐在总产量中占80％，二等盐降至20％，完全消灭了三等盐。没有发生任何人身事故和责任事故，劳动生产率比去年提高了41.75％，成本比去年降低34.28％。今年上半年，白家口制盐场被评为旅大市轻工业系统中的红旗单位。
    白家口制盐场今年海盐生产丰收，是不是老天爷帮了忙呢？不是的。今年1至9月比去年同时期多下了十二次雨，雨量加多了六十二公厘。这对制盐生产是不利的，加上今年的劳动力、工具都不足，在这种情况下要取得丰收，在保守主义者看来，完全是不可想像的。然而事实上，今年取得了比大跃进的1958年更大的丰收。原因何在呢？
    坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，这是白家口制盐场取得巨大胜利的决定因素。去冬今春，白家口党总支贯彻执行以卤为纲的方针，1、2月份连续发动了四次为卤而战的战役，为今年推行长期结晶准备好雄厚的卤源。当时，有保守思想的人看到去冬干了二百多个贮水池就泄了气，有的认为“没有万顷田难打万担粮”，意思是要多制卤不如多灌几个池子，不赞成冬季打冰采咸和深水制卤的办法。党总支就在制卤多、浓度高的第一生产组召开了现场会议，用事实教育了群众，批判了畏难情绪，把打冰采咸的群众运动推向高潮。在严寒的天气里，职工们穿上冰鞋，手持铁锹，破冰三十五万平方米。第九生产组，仅用两天时间就挖了一条二百米长的引水沟，有的工人，那怕是在半夜，一听到起风就下滩制卤。到1月20日就制出二十万立方米的卤水。2月中旬贯彻党委大破卤水关的指示，开始了“卤水级级加量，步步提高”的竞赛，到2月末完成制卤计划90％，卤量比去年增加了77.65％。4月中旬再次召开制卤比武大会，全体职工大擂战鼓，乘胜直追，到4月20日，各级卤水综合贮量达八十万立方米，比去年同期增加了三倍半。过去生产旺季经常发生缺卤现象，可是，今年5、6月比去年的贮卤量增加了160％。
    7、8月雨水频繁，有人又表现了畏难情绪，党总支及时召开了扩大会议，分析情况，采取措施，作出决议，发动职工在更大困难面前，鼓起更大干劲。接着大张旗鼓地宣传和贯彻了党的八届八中全会精神，反右倾、鼓干劲，生产上立即出现了一个轰轰烈烈的高潮。截至9月末，已产原盐十六万二千多吨，比去年同期提高26％，养卤三十七万立方米，比去年同期提高198.3％，工人修滩工效比去年提高25.1％。
    右倾思想受到批判，群众运动越来越高涨，群众的干劲越来越大。九个月来先后召开七十一次现场会议，四十多次经验介绍会，十一次比武大会，竞赛运动一日高一日。
    技术革新是白家口制盐场大搞群众运动的主要内容。1958年大跃进以来，广大职工破除迷信，解放思想，树立了敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。白家口制盐场面大，工人少，设备不足，另方面，职工干劲大，气候条件比较好。1958年春晒期间，复州湾盐场党委决定推行长期结晶的先进操作方法，就在白家口进行试点。经过一百多天试验结果，证明产量可以提高30％，质量完全达到一等盐的标准。
    长期结晶是制盐工作中的一项革命性的措施。过去海盐结晶操作，是墨守陈规地执行着三天一扒，两天一刮，遇雨就扒，一阴就刮的传统习惯。1958年推行长期结晶的结果，证明了这是一种先进的操作方法，同时又节省劳动力，又省电力。但是在开始推行这项操作方法的时候，有保守思想的人抱着怀疑态度，说：“如果要实行这个办法，除非盐场上加上个盖，否则是梦想。”经过现场会议，辩论会，虽然大部分职工拥护这个新的措施，可是还有少数人认为长期结晶是“冒险，要碰大运”。为了巩固职工的信心，书记亲自挂帅，加强了现场指导和思想教育。1959年上半年，生产情况再一次证明长期结晶不仅可以实行，而且效果很好。据统计，每公顷产量为一百二十四点一吨，比去年同期的九十四点五吨提高31.32％。白家口成为复州湾八个盐场中完成计划最高的单位。
    实行长期结晶，大大改变了部分群众中存在的靠天吃饭的观念，人们亲眼看到长期结晶产量质量都有提高。一般人对质量提高没有怀疑，但在产量方面却一直认为下雨扒盐总比不扒保险，池里的盐扒起来才算数。可是事实上，以复州湾全场来说，实行长期结晶比遇雨就扒的结晶池的产量多三吨，从结晶面积的单位产量来看，扒一次比扒三次的每公亩产量提高29.95％。长期结晶也缩小了高产低产的差额，今年各小组完成计划最好的为110％，最低也完成计划80％以上。今年3至4月平均扒盐二点二次，5月份平均扒了三点三次，从3月到5月比未实行长期结晶时少扒四至五次盐，这就基本上改变了三天一扒，两天一刮的老习惯。6月份因气候反常，又采取了不定扒的办法，保证了雨季不受损失。由于扒盐次数少，大大节约了劳动力，4至5月少扒五次共计节约三千一百五十个劳动日。工人们亲身体会到长期结晶大大减轻了劳动强度的好处，他们说：“过去下雨往外跑，现在下雨往家跑，只要雨前蒙好卤，雨后搬了水就行了，免去历来两次三番重灌的忙乱。实在是想不到的好事。”实行长期结晶的同时，留水深度增加到五公分以上，过去认为晒水不如晒池板的错误观念进一步得到纠正。盐工们为歌颂长期结晶写了不少诗句：有的写道：“长期结晶好，盐产得真不少；长期结晶好，质量大提高；长期结晶好，省工又省料。”这一项革命性的技术革新进一步激发了职工群众的创造性，为进一步改变盐场面貌开辟了道路。
    在白家口盐场上，过去用来扒盐的大耗，现在已为绳索牵引扒盐机所代替。
    所有这些技术革新，都是在去年出现的，在今年继续跃进中又有所提高。职工们并不以此为满足，他们正在为实现半机械化继续努力。
