Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 22nd. The Soviet National Youth Men's and Women's Basketball Teams held their sixth friendly visit game to China tonight at the Tianjin Gymnasium, with both the men's and women's teams winning. The women's team defeated the Liaoning Women's Basketball Team with a score of 69 to 42, and the men's team beat the Heilongjiang Men's Basketball Team with a score of 72 to 53.

In the first half of the women's game, the home team players were relatively nervous and made many mistakes. They only made five shots out of twenty-two attempts, and only five out of thirteen free throws. The visiting team intercepted the ball and launched fast breaks, resulting in the visiting team leading 39 to 15 in the first half. Although the home team counterattacked in the second half, it did not change the situation.

In the men's game, the tall Soviet team took the advantage early on, leading in scoring throughout. When the home team closed the gap to 13 to 19, the visiting team substituted in key players such as Anzor Lezhava, who is 2.08 meters tall, and their offense became more and more intense, leading 40 to 21 in the first half. In the second half, the home team launched continuous fast breaks, but still missed many shots and were repeatedly out-rebounded by the opponent, who then launched fast breaks, ultimately losing to the opponent.

The Soviet National Youth Men's and Women's Basketball Teams will go to Nanjing on the 24th.

    苏青年男、女篮球队双双获胜
    新华社天津22日电　苏联国家青年男、女篮球队今晚在天津体育馆举行访华第六次友谊比赛，男、女队双双获胜。女子队以六十九比四十二战胜了辽宁女子篮球队，男子队以七十二比五十三赢了黑龙江男子篮球队。
    女子队上半场主队队员比较紧张，失误很多，投篮二十二次只中五次，罚球十三次也只进五次。而客队截到球后就发动快攻，结果上半场客队以三十九比十五领先。下半场主队虽经反攻，终未改变局面。
    男子队的比赛开始不久，身材高大的苏联队就占了优势，得分一直领先。当主队追到十三比十九时，客队换上了身高二米零八的安佐尔·列扎瓦等主力队员，攻势越来越猛，上半场以四十比二十一领先。下半场主队连续展开快攻，但是投篮失误仍然很多，屡次被对方抢到篮板球后就展开快攻，最后仍输给对方。
    苏联国家青年男、女篮球队将于24日去南京。
