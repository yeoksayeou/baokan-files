The small converter of the Qingdao Bicycle Factory in Shandong Province raises the red flag higher and higher. In October, all production indicators created excellent results again. The utilization coefficient of the converter reached 30.858, the qualification rate reached 97.97%, the first-class product rate reached 95%, and the consumption of pig iron per ton of steel was 1,290 kg, exceeding the production level of many large open-hearth furnaces.

The 0.5-ton small converter of the Qingdao Bicycle Factory was built independently during the Great Leap Forward in steel production last year. Since the beginning of this year, the output and quality have been increasing month by month, and the consumption of pig iron has been continuously decreasing. The output in the third quarter of this year increased nearly eight times compared with the first quarter, becoming a red flag for small converters that are fast, good, and economical. The steel produced by this factory's small converter has been used to manufacture high-quality bicycles.

    跟大转炉并驾齐驱
    山东省青岛自行车厂小转炉红旗越举越高，10月份各项生产指标又创造了优异的成绩。转炉利用系数达到三十点八五八，合格率达到97.97％，一级品率达到95％，每吨钢消耗生铁一千二百九十公斤，超过了许多大洋转炉的生产水平。
    青岛自行车厂零点五吨小转炉是在去年大办钢铁中自力更生建成的。今年以来，产量质量逐月上升，生铁的消耗不断下降。今年三季度产量比第一季度增长了近八倍，成为小转炉一面多快好省的红旗。这个厂用小转炉炼出的钢，已制造出优等质量的自行车。
