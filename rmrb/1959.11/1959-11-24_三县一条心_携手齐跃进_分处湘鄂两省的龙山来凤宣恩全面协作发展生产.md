    Three Counties, One Heart: Leap Forward Together Hand in Hand
    Longshan, Laifeng, and Xuanen, located in Hunan and Hubei Provinces, Fully Cooperate to Develop Production
    (Our Newspaper Correspondent Chen Yongchu reports) Since the Great Leap Forward last year, Longshan County of Hunan Province and Laifeng and Xuanen Counties of Hubei Province have fully promoted the communist spirit and launched comprehensive cooperation, promoting the further development of industrial and agricultural production.
    Longshan, Laifeng, and Xuanen are located in the western mountainous areas of Hunan and Hubei provinces and are adjacent to each other. The county seats of Longshan and Laifeng are only fifteen li apart. Although separated by the You River, their farmlands, mountains, and forests are intertwined, and some water conservancy facilities are jointly managed and used. The economic ties between the working people have always been very extensive, and their friendship is also very close. After liberation, through the anti-feudal struggles such as suppressing bandits and land reform, the Party and the government have strengthened the unity and education of the masses, further developing and consolidating this traditional friendship. In recent years, when Comrade Zhang Tixue, Governor of Hubei Province, and Comrade Zhang Mengxu, Deputy Governor of Hunan Province, came to this area to inspect work, they went deep into the cadres and masses of neighboring provinces and counties to conduct interviews. The contact between the prefectural and county committees of both sides is even closer. Organized mutual learning and visits between county-level departments and communes occur forty to fifty times a year. Recently, Qi Shouliang, First Secretary of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee, and Zhang Xinyan, First Secretary of the Longshan County Party Committee, went to Laifeng County, Hubei Province, to extensively exchange views with the Secretary of the Enshi Prefectural Committee of Hubei Province and the Secretary of the Laifeng County Party Committee on further developing large-scale cooperation in water conservancy construction, industry and transportation, etc. They unanimously agreed that in the continued leap forward in production this winter and next year, communist large-scale cooperation should be carried out on a larger scale.
    The Hero Canal Reservoir, which is currently under construction in Longshan County, is the crystallization of the communist large-scale cooperation of these three counties. Several years ago, the Longshan County Party Committee had plans to build this reservoir. However, due to the limited strength of the agricultural cooperatives at the time, and the difficulty in resolving the issue of paddy fields in some agricultural cooperatives in Xuanen County being flooded, it was delayed. After the people's communes were established, favorable conditions were created for the construction of the reservoir, and the demands of the masses became increasingly urgent. Not long ago, the Longshan County Party Committee consulted with the Enshi Prefectural Committee and the Xuanen County Party Committee. The Enshi Prefectural Committee and the Laifeng and Xuanen County Party Committees believed that this was a great happy event for the people of Longshan County, and based on the principle of subordinating small interests to large interests, they expressed their full support. Proper arrangements were immediately made for the paddy fields and resettlement work that would be flooded due to the construction of the reservoir, and technical personnel were sent to help Longshan County with surveying, design, and drafting construction plans. After the reservoir construction began, the masses of Laifeng and Xuanen counties automatically sent a large number of timber, picks, and other tools and equipment to support the farmers of Longshan. In order to maximize the effectiveness of the reservoir, the county committees of Longshan, Laifeng, and Xuanen have recently studied and planned to expand the construction of the Hero Canal Reservoir, increasing the benefiting area of ​​more than 40,000 mu of paddy fields in Laifeng and Xuanen counties. The three counties will jointly be responsible for constructing a magnificent "Brother" reservoir on the border between the western parts of Hunan and Hubei provinces.
    Because these three counties have secretaries taking the lead, fully consulting, and the vast number of cadres and masses frequently visiting, learning from each other, cooperating with each other, and promoting each other, not only are some difficulties and problems between the three counties easily solved, but also advanced experiences can be disseminated in a timely manner, promoting the production and various tasks of each county. Longshan County has a longer history and more experience in planting double-cropping rice. Laifeng County only started trial planting in 1957. Because the early rice variety "Dwarf Glutinous" has a long growing season, it is difficult to catch up with the season when harvesting early rice and transplanting late seedlings. As a result, the yield of double-cropping rice is not high. Last year, Longshan County itself did not have enough improved varieties, but in order to jointly achieve the Great Leap Forward, the county party committee transferred more than 130,000 jin of early rice "Nante No." and late rice "Ma Glutinous" improved varieties with early maturity and high yield to support Laifeng County. Many experienced cadres and farmers in Longshan County also automatically came to Laifeng to provide technical guidance. With improved varieties and the active implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter," Laifeng County achieved a bumper harvest of more than 20,000 mu of double-cropping rice, with the yield per mu increasing from 400 to 500 jin in 1957 to 700 to 800 jin. The farmers in Laifeng County have rich experience in growing sugar beets. When the Longshan County Party Committee wanted to grow sugar beets this year, the Laifeng County Party Committee transferred more than 10,000 jin of seeds from its own planting plan to Longshan. After Longshan County's 10,000 mu of sugar beets had a bumper harvest this year, the Laifeng County Party Committee allocated some machines and sent technical personnel to help Longshan produce sugar. This year, Longshan County can produce more than 1.5 million jin of red and white sugar. In addition to self-sufficiency, it can also supply more than 1 million jin to the state.
    Through large-scale cooperation in agriculture, Longshan and Laifeng counties have also driven large-scale cooperation in industry, transportation, finance, commerce, culture, education, and health. The industrial base of these two counties was very weak in the past. Last year, when counties and communes vigorously developed industry, although both counties established iron and steel bases and machinery factories, the machinery and equipment were not complete, raw materials were often in short supply, and the technical strength was very weak. At this time, the county party committees of both sides strengthened the education of cadres and masses in industrial departments, making them understand the principle that "one palm cannot clap," so they carried out close cooperation in production and exchanged what they had for what they needed in raw materials, overcoming many difficulties in their advancement. In May of this year, the motor of the Laifeng County Machinery Factory broke down and had not been repaired for a long time, so they called the Longshan Machinery Factory for help. After receiving the call from the other party, the Longshan Machinery Factory immediately sent a technician to Laifeng to study with them and quickly repaired the machine. When the Longshan County Machinery Factory lacked steel, the Laifeng Machinery Factory sent them 400 jin of steel. In the past, the commercial departments of the two counties operated independently and did not interact with each other. Since the Great Leap Forward, they have established new friendly relations, and whether it is production materials or consumer goods, they have adjusted each other to ensure market supply. During the spring plowing season this year, the plows in Laifeng County could not be supplied in time, so the Longshan County Commercial Bureau transferred more than 1,500 plows that they had purchased to support Laifeng. When Longshan County lacked vegetable seeds, Laifeng County sent them a large number of vegetable seeds. The people of Longshan and Laifeng counties eat salt that comes from rock salt from Pengshui County, Sichuan Province. In the past, both counties had purchasing stations there, and when the salt was transported back, they took the same highway, so there were often conflicts over pre-emptive transportation. After the commercial departments launched large-scale cooperation last year, the purchasing stations were merged, and salt was allocated and transported in batches according to needs, and the number of personnel was reduced from four to two.
    In terms of culture, education, and health, these two counties are also full of cooperative flowers. Before 1958, the medical equipment of the Longshan County People's Hospital was poor, and there was a lack of medical personnel with high technical levels. When encountering difficult diseases, they would actively ask comrades from Laifeng People's Hospital to come for consultation. In May of last year, Liao Hesheng, a member of the Chengjiao Commune in Longshan County, suffered from intestinal obstruction, and his condition was very serious. The comrades from Longshan County Hospital asked the comrades from Laifeng County Hospital for help. After receiving the call, the comrades from Laifeng County Hospital also felt unsure, so they called the Enshi Prefecture People's Hospital for help. After learning of the news, Zhang Zhiming, the dean of Enshi Prefecture Hospital, and doctor Gao Qihua took an ambulance overnight and traveled more than 200 kilometers to Longshan by dawn. After consultations by medical personnel from the three hospitals, an abdominal operation was performed, which turned the patient from danger to safety. Since this year, the medical equipment of the Longshan County Hospital has been greatly improved, and the number of medical personnel with high technical levels has increased. Many people in Laifeng County who have difficult and complex diseases have also received timely treatment at the Longshan County People's Hospital.
    While carrying out large-scale cooperation, the county party committees of Longshan, Laifeng, and other counties have also strengthened the political and ideological education of the broad masses in mutual support, mutual learning, and common leap forward. Therefore, the communist spirit of working together and close cooperation has deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Some of the remaining bad habits of mutual exclusion, competition, mutual blockade, and harming others for one's own benefit that were left over from the old society have long disappeared. The Laoxing Commune in Longshan County and the Dengdong Commune in Laifeng County are adjacent areas. The Laoxing Commune used to have more timber, more land, and fewer people, while the Dengdong Commune used to have more tea oil forests, more people, and less land. Before liberation, under the control and manipulation of the landlord class, grain and timber from the Laoxing Commune area were not allowed to flow to Dengdong. After liberation, under the education of the Party, the relationship between the two sides has fundamentally improved, and they have cooperated and supported each other in production. During the Great Leap Forward, in order to grow more and harvest more, the Dengdong Commune consulted with the Laoxing Commune and reclaimed more than 300 mu of wasteland there. When reclaiming the wasteland, the Laoxing Commune also supported them with some plowing cattle, farm tools, and lent them some seeds and rations. Many people also automatically helped them weed and fertilize. During the autumn harvest, these more than 300 mu of land harvested more than 80,000 jin of corn, and the members of the Laoxing Commune also helped the Dengdong Commune transport it. The Chengjiao Commune in Longshan County and the Jielong Commune in Laifeng County are only separated by the You River, and the exchanges between the masses are more frequent. Many youth shock brigades and women's shock brigades on both sides have established a system of regular political study, technical study, and experience exchange. The youth shock brigade in Zhennanba, Longshan County, and the youth shock brigade in Shatuo, Laifeng County, jointly cultivated more than 10 mu of high-yield demonstration plots of victory rape, striving for a yield of 500 jin per mu next year and setting up a high-yield red flag for rape in the mountainous area. Now the masses have renamed this small river "Brother River" and plan to build a "Friendship Bridge" on the river this winter. Youth theater troupes and amateur sports teams in organs and rural areas also frequently perform and carry out friendship competitions with each other. A song is widely circulated among the masses here: "Hunan and Hubei are one family, as close as brothers with hearts linked together, shoulder to shoulder to carry out the leap forward, and communism will come soon."

    三县一条心　携手齐跃进
    分处湘鄂两省的龙山来凤宣恩全面协作发展生产
    本报讯　记者陈咏初报道：湖南省龙山县和湖北省来凤、宣恩两县，从去年大跃进以来，充分发扬了共产主义风格，展开全面大协作，促进工农业生产进一步发展。
    龙山、来凤、宣恩三县地处湘鄂两省西部，是互相毗邻的大山区。龙山、来凤两县的县城相距只有十五华里，中间虽隔着一条酉水，但田土山林却相互交错，有的水利设施还共同管理使用。劳动人民之间的经济联系，素来就非常广泛，友谊也很密切。解放以后，通过剿匪、土改等反封建斗争，党和政府又加强了对群众的团结教育，使这种传统的友谊得到了进一步发展和巩固。几年来，湖北省省长张体学同志、湖南省副省长张孟旭同志到这一带检查工作时，都深入到邻省邻县的干部和群众中进行访问。双方地、县委之间的接触，更为密切。县级各部门、各公社之间有组织的相互学习、访问，每年有四、五十次之多。最近，中共湘西土家族苗族自治州地委第一书记齐寿良和龙山县委第一书记张新彦又到湖北省来凤县，与湖北省恩施地委书记、来凤县委书记，就当前水利建设、工业交通等方面进一步开展大协作的问题，广泛交换了意见，一致同意在今冬和明年生产的继续跃进中，要在更大范围内开展共产主义大协作。
    目前在龙山县境内兴修的英雄运河水库，是这三个县共产主义大协作的结晶。几年以前，龙山县委就有兴修这座水库的打算。但是由于当时农业社的力量有限，加之宣恩县部分农业社要被水淹的稻田不好解决，因而就迟迟未能动手。人民公社化后，给兴修水库带来了有利条件，群众的要求也日益迫切。不久以前，龙山县委就与恩施地委和宣恩县委进行了协商。恩施地委与来凤、宣恩县委认为这是龙山县人民的一件大喜事，他们本着小利服从大利的原则，表示全力支持。对因修水库将要被水淹没的稻田和移民工作，随即作出了妥善安排，并派出技术人员帮助龙山县勘察设计，拟订施工计划。水库施工以后，来凤、宣恩两县的群众，自动地送来了大批木材、洋镐等工具和器材，支援龙山农民。为了使水库发挥更大的效用，最近，龙山、来凤、宣恩三县县委又经过研究，计划扩大英雄运河水库的施工，增加来凤、宣恩两县四万多亩稻田的受益面积，三县共同负责在湘鄂两省西部的边境上，修建一座规模宏伟的“兄弟”水库。
    由于这三个县做到书记挂帅，充分协商，广大干部和群众也经常互相访问，互相学习，互相协作，互相促进，不但使三县之间某些困难和问题迎刃而解，而且先进经验能够及时传播，推动了各县的生产和各项工作。龙山县种双季稻的历史较早，经验也较多，来凤县于1957年才开始试种，而且由于早稻品种“矮子粘”的生长期长，收早稻插晚秧难于赶上季节，因而，双季稻的产量不高。去年龙山县的良种本来自己也不够，但县委为了共同实现大跃进，就调出了成熟期早、产量高的早稻“南特号”和晚稻“麻粘”的良种十三万多斤，支援了来凤县。龙山县许多有经验的干部和农民，还自动的到来凤去进行技术辅导。来凤县有了良种，加上他们积极贯彻“八字宪法”结果，使得二万多亩双季稻大丰收，亩产量由1957年的四、五百斤提高到七、八百斤。来凤县农民早就有种甜菜的丰富经验，龙山县委今年想种甜菜时，来凤县委即从本县的播种计划内调出了一万多斤种子给龙山。龙山县今年万亩甜菜大丰收以后，来凤县委又调拨一部分机器、派出技术人员帮助龙山制糖。今年龙山县共可生产红白糖一百五十多万斤，除自给外，还能上调给国家一百多万斤。
    龙山、来凤两县通过农业方面的大协作，也带动了工业交通、财经商业、文教卫生各个方面的大协作。这两个县过去的工业基础都很薄弱，去年，县社大办工业时，虽然两县都建立了钢铁基地和机械厂，但是机器设备都不完善，原材料常感缺乏，技术力量也很单薄。这时双方县委都加强了对工业部门的干部和群众的教育，使他们懂得了“孤掌难鸣”的道理，因而在生产中进行了紧密的协作，在原材料上做到了互通有无，克服了前进中的许多困难。今年5月，来凤县机械厂的电动机出了故障，很久没有修好，就打电话请龙山机械厂帮忙。龙山机械厂接到对方的电话以后，即派了一位技师赶到来凤，与他们一道研究，很快就把机器修好了。龙山县机械厂缺乏钢材时，来凤机械厂就给他们送来了四百斤钢材。从前，两县的商业部门都是各营各业，不相往来。大跃进以来，他们建立了新的友谊关系，无论是生产资料和生活资料的商品，都作到了互相调剂，保证了市场供应。今年春耕时，来凤县的犁铧一时供应不上，龙山县商业局就把自己采购回来的犁铧调出了一千五百多个，支援来凤。龙山县的蔬菜种子缺乏时，来凤县便给他们送去了大批蔬菜种子。龙山、来凤两县人民的食盐，都是四川省彭水县的岩盐。从前两个县都在那里设有采购站，食盐运回时，又同走一条公路，因此经常发生预先抢运的矛盾。去年商业部门展开大协作以后，采购站进行了合并，食盐按照需要按比例分批调运，人员也由四个减少到了两个。
    在文教卫生方面，这两个县也遍开协作之花。1958年以前，龙山县人民医院的医疗设备较差，缺乏技术水平较高的医务人员，遇有疑难病症，就主动地请来凤人民医院同志来会诊。去年5月，龙山县城郊公社的社员廖和生患肠梗阻，病情很严重。龙山县医院的同志就请来凤县医院的同志帮忙。来凤县医院的同志接到电话以后，也感到没有把握，又打电话请恩施专区人民医院帮忙。恩施专区医院的同志得知这个消息后，院长张志明和医师高启华就连夜乘救护车赶了二百多公里路，天亮时到了龙山。经过三个医院的医务人员会诊，施行了剖腹手术，使病人转危为安。今年以来，龙山县医院的医疗设备大大改善，增加了技术水平较高的医务人员，来凤县许多发生疑难病症的群众，也在龙山县人民医院得到了及时治疗。
    龙山、来凤等县县委在大协作的同时，也加强了对广大群众互相支援，互相学习、共同跃进的政治思想教育，因而携手前进，密切协作的共产主义风格已深入人心。旧社会遗留下来的某些相互排斥、你争我夺、互相封锁、损人利己的残余恶习，早已消声敛迹。龙山县老兴公社与来凤县的邓洞公社是毗邻地区。老兴公社过去木材多、田土多、人口少，邓洞公社过去是油茶林多，人口多、田土少。解放前在地主阶级统治操纵下，老兴公社一带的粮食和木材不准流向邓洞。解放后，在党的教育下双方关系有了根本好转，在生产上互相协作，相互支持。在大跃进中，邓洞公社为了多种多收，就和老兴公社协商，在那里开了三百多亩荒地。开荒时，老兴公社还支援他们一些耕牛、农具，并借给了他们一部分种子和口粮，许多群众还自动帮助他们锄草和下肥。秋收时，这三百多亩土地收了包谷八万多斤，老兴公社的社员还帮助邓洞公社运送。龙山城郊公社和来凤县的接龙公社只隔一条酉水，群众的交往更为频繁。双方的许多青年突击队、妇女突击队，都建立了定期学习政治、学习技术、交流经验的制度。龙山县镇南坝的青年突击队还与来凤县沙坨的青年突击队，共同培育了十多亩胜利油菜丰产示范片，争取明年亩产五百斤，在山区树起油菜高产的红旗。现在群众把这条小河改名为“兄弟河”，并计划今冬在河上架起“友谊桥”。机关和农村的青年剧团、业余球队，也经常互相演出和开展友谊竞赛。在这里的群众中，普遍流传着这样一首歌谣：“湖南、湖北一家人，亲如兄弟心连心，并肩携手搞跃进，共产主义早来临。”
