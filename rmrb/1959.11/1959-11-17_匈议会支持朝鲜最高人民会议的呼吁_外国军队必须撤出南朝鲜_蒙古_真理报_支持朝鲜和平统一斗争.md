Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 15th: According to a report in "People's Liberty Daily" on the 15th, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Hungarian National Assembly discussed the letter from the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea to the parliaments of various countries regarding the peaceful reunification of Korea, and expressed its firm support for the peaceful proposals of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea.

The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Hungarian National Assembly believes that in the current stage of easing international tensions, the occupation of South Korea by the U.S. military, armed with destructive weapons, the unlimited expansion of the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) army, and the persecution of patriotic forces are intolerable and heinous provocations.

The committee believes that the artificial division of Korea into North and South not only causes great pain to the patriotic forces and people of Korea, but also maintains tensions in the Asian region and threatens world peace.

The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Hungarian National Assembly sympathizes with and firmly supports the just struggle of the Korean people for the reunification of their motherland. The committee believes that foreign troops must withdraw from South Korea, and the reunification of their motherland should be decided by the thirty million Korean people through free and democratic elections.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar: The Mongolian "Truth Daily" published a commentary on the 7th, supporting the appeal of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification of Korea.

The commentary said that the Mongolian people have always advocated the peaceful reunification of Korea, supported the activities and proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its efforts to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and warmly welcomed the appeal issued by the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea to the parliaments of various countries.

The commentary said, we believe that the issue of the peaceful reunification of Korea should be resolved correctly immediately. The Mongolian people fully sympathize with the demands of the Korean people for peaceful reunification and their struggle.

    新华社布达佩斯15日电　据“人民自由报”15日报道，匈牙利国民议会外交委员会讨论了朝鲜最高人民会议就朝鲜的和平统一问题给各国议会的信，并表示坚决支持朝鲜最高人民会议的和平建议。
    匈牙利国民议会外交委员会认为，在国际局势缓和的现阶段，以毁灭性武器武装起来的美国军队占据南朝鲜，李承晚军队无限制地扩充和对爱国力量的迫害，都是不能容忍的罪恶的挑衅。
    委员会认为，朝鲜被人为地分裂成南北两部分，这不仅给朝鲜的爱国力量和人民造成巨大的痛苦，而且在亚洲地区保持着紧张局势，威胁着世界和平。
    匈牙利国民议会外交委员会同情并坚决支持朝鲜人民为统一祖国而进行的正义斗争。委员会认为，外国军队必须撤出南朝鲜，而由三千万朝鲜人民通过自由民主的选举来决定他们祖国的统一。
    据新华社乌兰巴托讯　蒙古“真理报”7日发表评论，支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议关于朝鲜和平统一的呼吁。
    评论说，蒙古人民一贯主张朝鲜和平统一，支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在争取祖国和平统一方面的活动和各项建议，热烈欢迎朝鲜最高人民会议向各国议会发出的呼吁书。
