Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd, Washington dispatch: The U.S. State Department recently published a pamphlet on Taiwan, once again nakedly declaring that the U.S. government insists on a policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, and insists on armed occupation of China's territory Taiwan as a base for the U.S. to prepare for new wars. The pamphlet also shows that, as a way to promote this U.S. policy, the U.S. is increasingly blatantly creating "two Chinas."

The U.S. State Department's publication of such a pamphlet at this moment to explain that the U.S.’s "basic policy toward China" has not changed is further evidence that the U.S. is currently trying to maintain and escalate tensions in the Far East, and insists on a policy of aggression and war.

Intending to Occupy Our Territory Taiwan for a Long Time

The State Department pamphlet is divided into ten chapters, and its last chapter focuses on the policy of hostility towards China that the U.S. has insisted on implementing since 1949. It begins by saying that the "basic policy toward China" consistently pursued by the U.S. government includes: "We do not recognize the Communist regime, we oppose allowing it to obtain a seat in the United Nations, we strictly prohibit all trade with mainland China, and we do not allow cultural exchanges with the Beijing regime." In addition to the usual slanders and malicious attacks against People's China in the State Department pamphlet, it also exposes once again that the U.S. ruling clique is still dreaming of causing People's China to "disappear." The pamphlet quotes the words of the late U.S. Secretary of State Dulles: The U.S. "assumes that the forced uniformity of international communism, in China and elsewhere, is a phenomenon that will disappear rather than a permanent one. We believe that it is the responsibility of ourselves, our allies...to do everything possible to make this phenomenon disappear."

The pamphlet clearly admits that the U.S. occupation of China's territory Taiwan is "mainly out of consideration for the supreme national interests of the United States," because "Taiwan is a crucial link in the island defense chain of the free world in the Pacific," and Taiwan "is a base for the defense of the free world in the Far East." In narrating the history of the U.S. armed occupation of Taiwan in 1950, the signing of the "Mutual Defense Treaty" between the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek in 1954, and the passage of a resolution by the U.S. Congress in 1955 authorizing the president to use U.S. armed forces to prevent the Chinese people from liberating their territory Taiwan, the pamphlet also repeatedly quotes U.S. official documents, emphasizing Taiwan's "strategic importance" in the U.S.'s deployment to invade China and the entire Western Pacific region, emphasizing that "firmly occupying" the "chain of islands in the Western Pacific" including Taiwan "is extremely important to the vital interests of the United States."

Attempting to Conceal Responsibility for Creating Tension

The U.S. State Department pamphlet also boasts about the U.S.'s war provocations in the Taiwan Strait area in September and October 1958, saying that "the U.S.'s dispatch of strong naval and air forces to the Western Pacific during the crisis" "shows that the U.S. can act quickly and effectively." This kind of warmongering talk can only remind people that the tension existing in the Taiwan Strait area is at any time in danger of being further led by the U.S. towards serious deterioration. The U.S.'s activities to escalate the tension in the Taiwan Strait area are also a part of the U.S.'s intensified "Cold War" in Asia.

However, the U.S. State Department pamphlet also tries its best to conceal and shirk the U.S.'s responsibility for creating tension in the Taiwan Strait area. The pamphlet narrates the so-called trick the U.S. played in the United Nations to arrange a "ceasefire" in the Taiwan Strait, and the so-called suggestion of "universal renunciation of the use of force" repeatedly put forward by the U.S. in the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks since 1955, while attacking China for "firmly refusing to agree to any arrangements made to calm the situation in the Taiwan Strait." This kind of black-and-white reversal can even be seen clearly from the pamphlet's explanation of these so-called "ceasefires" and "renunciation of the use of force." The pamphlet shows that the U.S. attempts to guarantee the U.S.'s "right" to occupy Taiwan through the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" under the cover of these claims. The U.S. refuses the Chinese side's proposal to "insist that the U.S. withdraw its troops from the Taiwan area." That is to say, the U.S. is conspiring to use the guise of so-called "ceasefires" and "renunciation of the use of force" to deprive the Chinese people of their sacred right to liberate their territory Taiwan, while making the U.S.'s use of force to occupy Chinese territory legal, and making the U.S.'s actions to create tension in this region legal.

In the pamphlet, the U.S. State Department once again attempts to abuse the principle of non-use of force in international disputes to interfere in China's internal affairs and occupy China's territory Taiwan for a long time. People know that the international dispute existing between China and the U.S. is the U.S.'s armed aggression against China. If the U.S. government officials truly act in accordance with their recently verbally expressed willingness to resolve all international disputes peacefully without the use of force, then the U.S. should immediately stop using force to occupy Chinese territory, stop military provocations and war threats against China, and withdraw all U.S. armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area. However, the U.S. State Department once again announced its refusal to do so in this pamphlet. This can only show that the actions taken by the U.S. government do not match its words.

Creating "Two Chinas" Has Been Planned for a Long Time

The State Department pamphlet also narrates the evolution of the U.S.'s policy towards the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek Group. From this, it can be seen that the U.S. has been planning to create "two Chinas" for a long time. This official document of the U.S. State Department reveals the U.S.'s intention to continue to promote the "two Chinas" policy. The U.S. State Department explains that this pamphlet only "describes" "the current territory and base of Free China (Chiang Kai-shek Group)," completely separating Taiwan from mainland China, and talking a lot about Taiwan's "geography," "history," and so on. The pamphlet also has several chapters on Taiwan's "economy," "people's livelihood," and "U.S. aid," using a lot of space to "prove" the so-called "ability of Taiwan to make progress and development" in the ten years under U.S. occupation. On the one hand, this is to cover up the truth that Taiwan's economy is exhausted and the people's livelihood is declining under U.S. plunder, and on the other hand, it is also to create the fallacy that Taiwan can "develop" after being separated.

A series of statements recently made by the U.S. ruling clique to prepare to abandon the Chiang Kai-shek Group in order to create "two Chinas" have caused great shock and resentment in Taiwan. The U.S. State Department stated in this pamphlet that "the U.S. continues to recognize and support the Republic of China (Chiang Kai-shek Group)" in order to appease the Chiang Kai-shek Group, but the pamphlet then unambiguously stated that the U.S.'s policy towards Taiwan is "out of consideration for the supreme national interests of the United States," and is to occupy Taiwan as a U.S. base for aggression. In order to permanently "firmly occupy" this place, the U.S. is conspiring to isolate Taiwan and then place Taiwan under trusteeship, conspiring to move from "supporting" the Chiang Kai-shek Group to abandoning the Chiang Kai-shek Group, so that Taiwan will eventually become a U.S. colony and war base.

    美国国务院加剧远东紧张局势发表关于台湾的小册子
    坚持敌视中国政策　露骨地制造“两个中国”
    新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院最近发表的一本关于台湾的小册子，又一次赤裸裸地申明，美国政府坚持敌视中国人民的政策，坚持武装霸占中国领土台湾作为美国准备新战争的基地。小册子同时显示出，作为推行美国这种政策的一种方式，美国正越来越露骨地在制造“两个中国”。
    美国国务院在目前这样的时机发表这样的小册子来说明美国“对中国的基本政策”毫无改变，这是美国目前竭力在远东保持和加剧紧张局势，坚持侵略政策和战争政策的又一证据。
    妄图长期占领我领土台湾
    国务院小册子共分十章，它的最后一章集中叙述了美国从1949年以来坚持执行的敌视中国的政策。它开头便说，美国政府一贯奉行的“对中国的基本政策”包括：“我们不承认共产党政权，我们反对让它在联合国里取得席位，我们严格禁止同大陆中国的一切贸易，并且我们不准许同北平政权进行文化交流”。国务院小册子里除了对人民中国照例进行诬蔑和恶毒攻击以外，又一次暴露美国统治集团还一直在做着促使人民中国“消逝”的白日梦呓。小册子引用已故美国国务卿杜勒斯说过的话：美国“假设：国际共产主义的强求一致的统治，在中国和在其他地方一样，是一种要消逝的、而不是一种永久的现象。我们认为，尽一切可能使这种现象消逝，是我们自己、我们的盟国……的责任”。
    小册子里明白地承认，美国占领中国领土台湾，“主要出于对美国的最高国家利益的考虑”，因为“台湾是自由世界在太平洋的岛屿防御锁链中的一个极关重要的环节”，台湾“是自由世界在远东防卫的一个基地”。小册子在叙述美国在1950年武装侵占台湾、1954年美蒋签订“共同防御条约”、1955年美国国会通过决议授权总统使用美国武装部队来阻止中国人民解放自己领土台湾的历史时，也一再引用美国官方文件，强调台湾在美国侵略中国以及侵略整个西太平洋地区的部署中“战略上的重要性”，强调“牢牢占有”包括台湾在内的“西太平洋岛屿锁链”“对美国的切身利益是极为重要的”。
    企图掩饰制造紧张的责任
    美国国务院小册子里还吹嘘1958年9、10月间美国在台湾海峡地区的战争挑衅行动，说什么“美国在危机期间把强大的海空部队调到西太平洋一事”，“表明美国能够迅速而有效地”行动。这种好战的谈论只能提醒人们注意：台湾海峡地区存在的紧张局势随时有被美国进一步导向严重恶化的危险。美国加剧台湾海峡地区紧张局势的活动，也是美国在亚洲加紧“冷战”的一个部分。
    然而，美国国务院小册子里还竭力想掩饰和推卸美国在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势的责任。小册子叙述了美国在联合国进行过的所谓安排在台湾海峡“停火”的把戏，以及美国在1955年以来中美大使级会谈里一再提出的所谓“普遍放弃使用武力”的建议，而攻击中国“坚决不肯同意为平息台湾海峡的局势而作的任何安排”。这种颠倒黑白的说法，甚至从小册子里对这些所谓“停火”、“放弃使用武力”的解释中也可以看得清清楚楚。小册子表明，美国企图在这些主张的掩盖下，保证美国通过美蒋“共同防御条约”占领台湾的“权利”。美国拒绝中国方面提出的“坚持要美国把部队撤出台湾地区”。这就是说，美国阴谋利用所谓“停火”、“放弃使用武力”的幌子，剥夺中国人民解放自己领土台湾的神圣权利，而使得美国使用武力侵占中国领土合法化，使得美国在这个地区制造紧张局势的行径合法化。
    美国国务院在小册子里，再一次企图滥用国际争端中不使用武力的原则来干涉中国的内政，长期霸占中国的领土台湾。人们知道，中美之间存在的国际争端是美国对中国的武装侵略。如果美国政府人士真正按照他们最近在口头上表示的愿意不运用武力而和平解决一切国际争端行事，那么美国便应该立即停止使用武力侵占中国领土，停止对中国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，而从台湾和台湾海峡地区撤出美国一切武装力量。但是，美国国务院在这本小册里又一次宣布拒绝这样做。这只能说明，美国政府采取的行动并不符合它的言词。
    制造“两个中国”蓄谋已久
    国务院小册子里，也叙述了美国对台湾蒋介石集团的政策的演变。从中可以看到，美国制造“两个中国”蓄谋已久。美国国务院这个正式文件透露了美国继续推行“两个中国”政策的意图。美国国务院说明，这本小册子只是“描述”“自由中国目前领土、基地”等，完全把台湾同中国大陆割裂开来，大谈台湾“地理”、“历史”等等。小册子还有关于台湾“经济”、“民生”、“美援”等若干章，用大量篇幅来“证明”所谓台湾在美国占领下十年中“有进步和发展的能力”，这一方面是在掩盖台湾在美国掠夺下经济疲敝、民生雕零的真相，一方面也是在制造被割裂后的台湾可以“发展”的谬论。
    美国统治集团最近发表的一连串准备抛弃蒋介石集团来制造“两个中国”的言论，在台湾引起了很大的震动和愤懑。美国国务院在这本小册子里表示“美国继续承认和支持中华民国（蒋介石集团），以安抚蒋介石集团，但是，小册子里跟着又毫不含糊地声称，美国对台湾的政策是“出于对美国的最高国家利益的考虑”，是为了要占据台湾作为美国的侵略基地。而为了永久“牢牢占有”这块地方，美国正阴谋孤立台湾进而托管台湾，阴谋从“支持”蒋介石集团走向抛弃蒋介石集团，使台湾最后变成美国的殖民地和战争基地。
