    Huang Kou Commune Exchanges Soil, Turns Over Land, and Applies Fertilizer in Chonggou
    Large Tracts of Alkaline Land Grow Wheat Seedlings
    (Our Dispatch) The 23,000 mu of alkaline land improved by the Huang Kou Commune in Xiao County, Anhui Province, during the autumn planting season have all been planted with wheat, with a germination rate of over 90%.
    The Huang Kou Commune has a variety of soil types, generally of poor quality. In the past, people had a strong desire to improve the soil, but it was never realized. Last year, after the establishment of the commune, the commune's Party committee led the broad masses of commune members to "demand grain from alkaline land," organizing forces to plant rice, deeply plow the land, and exchange soil in the gullies, which initially changed the low-yield appearance of the alkaline land. For example, before the alkali was improved, wheat production was only 47 jin per mu. Last year, after soil improvement, the 8,100 mu of wheat planted averaged 117 jin per mu, an increase of 1.5 times.
    This year, the task of improving alkaline land for the whole commune is large, the quality requirements are high, and the time is tight. However, under the unified planning and leadership of the commune, this work has been carried out very well. In order to eliminate ideological obstacles in improving alkaline land, at the beginning of the autumn planting season, the commune's Party committee organized the masses to widely discuss questions such as "Should alkaline land be improved, how should it be improved? Can production be increased, and what if there is insufficient labor?" During the discussion, various conservative ideas such as "the foundation of alkaline land is poor, and it won't work no matter how much it is improved," and "the production tasks are heavy now, and there is no time or manpower" were criticized. Then, each large team established a soil improvement leading group, headed by the secretary; at the same time, the commune specially ran training classes, concentrating on training 950 technicians and cadres above the production team leader level, as technical leaders. Each large team also held on-site meetings, organized visits, and improved soil improvement techniques.
    For the fertilizer needed for soil improvement, the commune first invested 70,000 yuan to establish a bacterial fertilizer factory, and each large team established bacterial fertilizer processing factories. The commune also organized 9,500 people to collect and produce various organic fertilizers, basically meeting the needs of alkaline land improvement.
    In the soil improvement, the Huang Kou Commune adopted a variety of methods suitable to local conditions and time. These methods mainly include the following points: First, flushing gullies, exchanging soil, and applying fertilizer layer by layer. The specific method is to first plow a ditch when sowing, take out the alkaline soil and replace it with good soil, and then sow; another method is to spread livestock manure mixed with household soil and pit soil before plowing, then open a ditch and sow, and then cover with a layer of good soil and a layer of manure, flatten it after covering, and then cover with a layer of grass manure. This can prevent the seedlings from being attacked by alkaline soil and ensure vigorous growth of wheat seedlings. Second, deeply plow the land and increase the application of organic fertilizer. One method is to deeply plow the soil manually, pressing the alkaline soil to a depth of two feet below the soil, and turning the silt soil from the lower layer up to become good land; another method is to use tractors and deep plows for deep plowing, generally to a depth of one foot two inches to one foot five inches, plowing and harrowing at the same time, combined with the application of organic fertilizer. Third, sow in advance. For lightly alkaline land, sowing in advance not only does not affect crop growth, but also has the effect of changing alkalinity. Fourth, plant alkaline crops. Planting alkali cyanobacteria and vetch on alkaline land can not only completely change the alkalinity within two or three years, but also these crops can be used as feed and fertilizer. The Huang Kou Commune has planted 3,000 mu of alkali cyanobacteria and 800 mu of vetch in the autumn planting season.
    This year's soil improvement has greatly accelerated the progress and far surpassed the quality of last year, thanks to the full exertion of the powerful power of the people's commune by the commune's Party committee and the correct application of effective methods for soil improvement. Now, the 25,000 mu of alkaline land in the whole commune has been improved, the amount of fertilizer applied has exceeded the original plan, and the planted wheat is growing very well. At present, the commune's Party committee has organized forces to fight a major battle to protect seedlings, strengthen the management of alkaline land, and prepare to loosen the alkaline land first after rain to prevent the soil from hardening and prevent the rise of alkali.

### 黄口公社冲沟换土翻地施肥  大片碱地长出麦苗

    黄口公社冲沟换土翻地施肥
    大片碱地长出麦苗
    本报讯　安徽萧县黄口公社在秋种中改良的二万三千亩碱地，已全部种上小麦，出苗率达90％以上。
    黄口公社土壤种类较多，一般土质较差。过去人们虽有改良土壤的强烈愿望，但一直无法实现。去年公社一成立，公社党委就领导广大社员“向碱地要粮”，组织力量改种水稻，深翻土地，冲沟换土，这才使碱地初步改变了低产面貌。如小麦未经改碱前亩产只有四十七斤，去年改良土壤后种的八千一百亩小麦，平均亩产达一百一十七斤，提高一点五倍。
    今年全社改良碱地的任务大、质量要求高，时间也紧迫。但在公社的统一规划和领导下，这项工作进行得十分出色。为了扫除在改良碱地中的思想障碍，秋种一开始，公社党委就以“碱地要不要改，怎样改？能不能增产，劳力不足怎么办？”等问题，组织群众广泛讨论。讨论中批判了所谓“碱地底子孬，再改也不行”，“现在生产任务重，没有时间和力量”等形形色色的保守思想。接着各大队建立土壤改良领导小组，由书记挂帅；同时公社专门开办训练班，集中训练了九百五十名技术员和生产队长以上干部，作为技术领导力量。各大队也分别召开现场会，组织参观，提高改良土壤的技术。
    改良土壤中所需用的肥料，首先由公社拿出七万元建立了一座细菌肥料厂，各大队分别建立了细菌肥料加工厂。公社还组织了九千五百人，采制各种有机肥料，基本上满足了改良碱地的需要。
    黄口公社在改良土壤中，因地因时制宜采取了多种多样的方法。这些方法主要有以下几点：第一、冲沟、换土、层层施肥。具体作法是在播种时先用犁开沟，取出碱土换进好土，再进行播种；另一种办法是耕前撒牲畜粪加盖家土和坑土，然后开沟撒播，种后复盖一层好土一层粪，盖后耙平，再复盖一层草粪。这可以使幼苗不受碱土侵袭，保证麦苗生长旺盛。第二、深翻土地，增施有机肥料。一种办法是用人工深翻土，把碱土压到土壤二尺深以下，把下层淤泥土翻上来变成好田；另一种办法是用拖拉机、深耕犁深耕，一般深耕一尺二寸到一尺五寸，随耕随耙，结合施有机肥料。第三、提前播种。对于碱轻的地，提前播种不但不影响作物生长，而且有改变碱性的作用。第四、种碱性作物，碱地种碱青、苕子，不仅两三年内能全部改变碱性，而且这些作物还可以作饲料和肥料。黄口公社在秋种中已下种三千亩碱青，八百亩苕子。
    今年土壤改良由于公社党委充分发挥了人民公社强大威力，正确地运用了改良土壤的有效方法，所以改良的进度比去年大大加快，质量远胜过去年。现在全社二万五千亩碱地已改良完毕，施肥量都超过原来计划，种上的麦子生长很好。目前，公社党委已组织力量大战保苗关，加强碱地管理，准备雨后先疏松碱地，不让土壤板结，防止碱分上升。
