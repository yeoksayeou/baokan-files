    Storing Cabbage in Empty Rooms and Basements
    Cabbage for the winter can be stored in empty rooms, basements, or bedrooms.

    Before storing cabbage, it should be sun-dried for a few days to wither the outer leaves, reducing moisture content and improving preservation. After sun-drying, remove any yellow leaves and individual rotten outer leaves to prevent spoilage and leaf drop. However, try to preserve good outer leaves as much as possible to protect the heart of the cabbage.

    During storage, prevent the cabbage from overheating or freezing. Stack the cabbage in batches, leaving half a foot of space between each batch for ventilation. Also, regularly rotate the cabbage, moving the top layer to the bottom and vice versa. In the initial storage period, aim to rotate three times within half a month. Until the New Year (Gregorian calendar), rotate every seven days. From the New Year to the Spring Festival, when the weather is coldest, rotate every ten to fifteen days. From the Spring Festival to early March, rotate every seven days. Remove any rotten leaves during rotation. Cabbage that is not suitable for further storage can be picked out to be eaten first.

    Pay attention to ventilation when storing cabbage. In the early storage period, when the weather is warmer, strengthen ventilation by fully opening doors and windows, even at night if there is no risk of freezing. In December, as the weather gets colder, close doors and windows at night and open them during the day. From December to February, when the weather is coldest, half an hour of ventilation during warmer periods is sufficient. After February, as the weather gradually warms up, ventilation time can be gradually increased, but be careful to prevent freezing. For cabbage stored in bedrooms, where ventilation is difficult, leave more space between the cabbage stacks and frequently check and rotate them. If necessary, take the cabbage outdoors to air it out.

    用空房、地下室贮藏白菜
    冬季的白菜可以利用空房、地下室或者卧室贮存。
    白菜贮存以前要先晾晒几天，把白菜的外层帮晒蔫萎，水分小了，好保存。晾晒好以后还要把黄叶和个别的烂帮撕去，这样可以防止腐烂和脱帮。但是好菜帮要尽量保留下来，以保护菜心。
    贮存期间不要使白菜受热或受冻。贮存的白菜要一批一批的码起来，批与批之间要离开半尺远的空隙，便于通风。同时还要经常倒动，把上层的白菜倒到下层，下层的倒到上层。贮存初期争取在半个月内连倒三次；到阳历年每七天倒一次；阳历年至春节气候最冷，可以十至十五天倒一次；春节到3月初，七天倒一次。倒菜时随手撕去烂叶。不适合继续保存的菜可以挑出先吃。
    贮藏的白菜要注意通风换气。贮存初期天气较暖，要加强通风换气，门窗全打开，只要不受冻，夜间也不用关闭。12月份天气渐冷，门窗要夜间关起，白天打开。12月份到2月天气最冷，在天暖和的时候通风半小时就够了。2月以后天气渐暖，可以逐渐增加通风时间，但要注意防冻。在卧室内贮存的白菜，不易通风，可以把菜堆多留空隙，并勤检查倒动，必要时可将菜拿到室外过一过风。
