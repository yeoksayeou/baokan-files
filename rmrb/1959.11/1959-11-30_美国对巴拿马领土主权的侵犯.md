    US Infringement on Panama's Territorial Sovereignty
    Zhang Ye
    The Panamanian people's struggle to defend sovereignty over the Canal Zone continues to move forward. Following the large-scale anti-American demonstrations in the first few days of November, the raising of the Panamanian flag in the Canal Zone, and the solemn resolution formally passed by the National Assembly to recover the Panama Canal Zone, on the 28th, the Panamanian people once again held even larger anti-American demonstrations on the anniversary of their independence from Spanish colonial rule, protesting against U.S. imperialism's infringement on Panama's sovereignty and territory, and peacefully entering the Canal Zone for a patriotic symbolic occupation.
    The United States has occupied the Panama Canal and Canal Zone for fifty-six years, a history of pain and struggle for the Panamanian people.
    In the 1840s, as the United States began to take shape as an imperialist power, it repeatedly attempted to reserve for itself the right to dig a canal through Central America connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and to ensure that it enjoyed privileges in this canal area, in order to serve as a base for outward expansion, especially towards Central and South America. In 1846, the United States signed a treaty with New Granada (the old name for Greater Colombia, of which Panama was then a province) regarding the digging of a canal. However, the British government, which had already gained control in the Caribbean region, feared that the United States would gain exclusive rights, which would be detrimental to Britain. After 1848, Britain signed a treaty with Nicaragua, obtaining exclusive rights to build a canal in Nicaragua. The United States and Britain then engaged in a sharp struggle over the issue of building a canal in the Caribbean region. Because the United States' position in this region was not yet stable at that time, it had to compromise with Britain, and in 1850, the United States and Britain signed the famous Clayton-Bulwer Treaty. The United States proposed a guarantee: the planned Panama or Nicaragua canal must remain neutral, and both countries would use and enjoy the rights of this canal on equal terms.
    Later, France took advantage of the competition between the United States and Britain and joined the struggle. In 1878, a French businessman named de Lesseps (who led the construction of the Suez Canal) obtained the right to dig the Panama Canal from the Colombian government in the name of the "International Maritime Canal Company," and hired de Lesseps to lead the construction. The United States felt extremely anxious about this and warned France, but failed to stop the French from acting. By 1889, when two-fifths of the entire project had been completed, due to poor management and inability to continue construction, the U.S. government took the opportunity to exert pressure and purchased all the assets of the French company in January 1902 for a price of 40 million US dollars. At the same time, in order to exclusively possess the right to dig the canal, the United States took advantage of Britain's troubled times and forced Britain to make concessions. In 1901, Britain and the United States signed the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty, and the two sides agreed that the U.S. government would independently dig and control the canal. This was a new victory for young U.S. imperialism in its outward expansion, excluding Britain and France and independently obtaining the right to dig the strategically important Panama Canal.
    After defeating its two rivals, Britain and France, the United States then proposed to the Colombian government the demand to dig the canal and permanently lease a strip of land three miles wide on both sides of the canal. In August 1903, the Colombian government rejected the U.S. government's unreasonable demands. The U.S. imperialists, who had just won the Spanish-American War not long ago, were certainly not willing to give up, and therefore adopted the means of creating "revolutions" and intervening, which have been repeatedly used by colonial countries, to achieve their plundering goals.
    The U.S. government, through Cromwell, the legal counsel for digging the canal, instigated riots in the province of Panama, Colombia, and then sent warships to block Colombian troops from suppressing the riots. As a result, Panama declared its independence from Colombia on November 3, 1903. Three days later, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt recognized the new government of Panama, and ten days later, the Panamanian minister was received in Washington. On November 18, the "Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty" was signed according to the dictates of the United States. This was an unequal, enslaving treaty imposed on Panama. The United States obtained the permanent lease of a ten-mile-wide strip of land on both sides of the Canal Zone at the cost of a one-time payment of ten million U.S. dollars and a subsequent annual rent of two hundred and fifty thousand U.S. dollars. This thoroughly colonialist "Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty" stipulated that Panama authorized the United States to permanently use, occupy, and control a certain area in the isthmus of Panama in order to build, maintain, operate, and protect this canal between the two oceans. The U.S. government ruled the Canal Zone through the governor of the Canal Zone (who also served as the manager of the Panama Canal Company) appointed by it. The technical personnel in the Canal Zone were all Americans, and the police, judiciary, and health work were all under U.S. jurisdiction. All buildings belonged to the U.S. government, Americans enjoyed extraterritorial rights, and there were approximately 25,000 U.S. troops stationed in the Canal Zone. At both ends of the canal—the port of Balboa (on the Pacific) and the port of Cristobal (on the Atlantic)—became U.S. naval bases. Under the pretext of defending the canal, the treaty also stipulated the United States' right to interfere in Panamanian affairs outside the Canal Zone.
    In this way, the Panama Canal Zone, covering an area of more than 1,300 square kilometers, was completely placed under U.S. colonial rule, forming a "state within a state," seriously infringing on Panama's territory and sovereignty, and further controlling Panama's political life, destroying and plundering Panama's economy.
    Afterwards, the United States used pro-American elements in Panama to manipulate successive elections on the one hand, and created coups to overthrow regimes it deemed unsatisfactory on the other. Therefore, Panama has had twenty-nine presidents in the fifty-six years since its independence. These figures in power are limited to a group of families and their branches. Whether they came to power through elections or seized power through violence, they were manipulated behind the scenes by the United States. The current president, Chiari, came to power after the general election in May 1956. This government basically represents the interests of U.S. monopoly capital and domestic landlords, is pro-American and anti-Soviet in foreign policy, and implements a reactionary policy of persecuting communists, suppressing strikes, and destroying democratic freedoms at home. However, under the circumstances of the continuous rise of the people's movement, the Panamanian government has had to take some measures to defend sovereignty over the Canal Zone.
    Panama is a semi-colonial and semi-feudal agricultural country, and its economic lifeline is almost entirely controlled by U.S. imperialism. In addition to the Canal Zone, the United Fruit Company of the United States owns a large amount of land in Panama and controls the country's banana production. The country's transportation, electricity, and other public utilities are also in the hands of U.S. companies. By the end of 1955, U.S. private investment in Panama was 479 million U.S. dollars, most of which was invested in merchant shipping companies and oil enterprises. Panama's foreign trade is also heavily dependent on the United States. In 1957, 96% of Panama's commodities were exported to the United States.
    Panama has a population of only 967,000 people. Half of the country is uninhabited, and about half of the population relies on working in the Canal Zone to make a living. However, because the United States implements a policy of racial discrimination in the Canal Zone, American and Panamanian employees working in the Canal Zone are not paid equally for equal work. American employees are paid "gold" wages according to American standards, while Panamanians, Indians, and other Latin Americans are paid "silver" wages. "Silver" wages are only one-sixth of "gold" wages, which seriously affects the lives of Panamanians. Although the "Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty" revised in 1955 stipulates that American and Panamanian workers in the Canal Zone should be paid equally for equal work, the U.S. authorities still refuse to implement it. As for the income from the Panama Canal and the Canal Zone, the vast majority belongs to the United States. In the 1958 fiscal year, the total income of the Canal Zone was as high as 83 million U.S. dollars, of which the income from canal tolls was 43 million U.S. dollars, while the "rent" paid by the United States to the Panamanian government was only 1.93 million U.S. dollars. In addition, the United States also uses its occupation of the Canal Zone and its control of Panama's economic lifeline. The U.S. authorities in the Canal Zone not only do not buy Panamanian goods, but also dump American goods throughout Panama, seriously undermining Panama's national enterprises and making Panama's economy increasingly worse.
    Therefore, the Panamanian people, under the humiliation and plunder of U.S. imperialism, have been waging a resolute struggle to abolish this treaty and recover sovereignty over the Canal Zone since the day the first "Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty" was signed in 1903. In 1936 and 1955, due to the rise of the people's movement, the Panamanian government twice forced the United States to amend the "Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty." The nationalization of the Suez Canal by Egypt in July 1956 further promoted the Panamanian people's struggle to defend sovereignty over the Canal Zone. Since the beginning of this year, encouraged by the victory of the Cuban people's revolution and the increasingly high tide of the anti-American struggle of the people in Latin America, especially in the Caribbean region, the Panamanian people's struggle against the U.S. occupation of the Canal Zone and to defend national sovereignty has become even more turbulent. The anti-American demonstrations continuously held by Panamanian patriots since November 3 and the two peaceful entries into the Canal Zone are a new upsurge in the Panamanian people's struggle.
    Faced with the unprecedentedly high tide of anti-American anger among the Panamanian people, U.S. imperialism has once again exposed its hideous face as an aggressor. On the one hand, it continues to exert pressure on the Panamanian government, slandering the patriotic anti-American demonstrations of the Panamanian people as "mob actions," and threatening that these demonstrations "exceeded the standards of etiquette that have always existed between countries maintaining friendly relations," demanding that the Panamanian government "maintain public order," attempting to stop the just struggle of the Panamanian people. On the other hand, U.S. imperialism is once again playing deceptive tricks, attempting to ease the anti-American sentiment of the Panamanian people with "measures to help Panama develop its economic base." In addition, it also sent Deputy Undersecretary of State Merchant to Panama to meet with the Panamanian authorities, acknowledging that the Panamanian government has nominal sovereignty over the Canal Zone, promising that the United States will give priority to purchasing from Panama when purchasing materials for the Canal Zone, and once again proposing to negotiate economic issues with Panama after the situation calms down. However, this combination of hard and soft tactics by U.S. imperialism has not achieved its goal; the demonstrations held by the Panamanian people on November 28 are the best proof. The rise of the Panamanian people's struggle to safeguard territorial sovereignty is another powerful blow to U.S. imperialism. (Attached picture)

    美国对巴拿马领土主权的侵犯
    章叶
    巴拿马人民保卫运河区主权的斗争，继续向前发展。继11月最初几天的反美大示威，并在运河区树立起巴拿马国旗以及国民议会正式通过一定要收回巴拿马运河区的庄严决议后，28日，巴拿马人民在摆脱西班牙殖民统治独立纪念日，再次举行规模更大的反美示威，抗议美帝国主义对巴拿马主权和领土的侵犯，并用和平方式进入运河区作爱国的象征性的占领。
    美国霸占巴拿马运河和运河区，已有五十六年的历史，对巴拿马人来说，这是一页痛苦与斗争的历史。
    在十九世纪四十年代，美国开始形成为帝国主义的时候，就曾多次试图为自己在中美洲地区保留开凿贯通大西洋和太平洋的运河的权利，并保证自己在这条运河地区享有特权，以便作为向外扩张，特别是向中、南美洲扩张的基地。1846年美国曾与新·格兰得（大哥伦比亚的旧名，当时巴拿马是它的一个省）订立关于开凿运河的条约。但在加勒比海地区早已取得控制权的英国政府害怕美国取得独占权，对英国不利，1848年后，英国就同尼加拉瓜订立条约，取得在尼加拉瓜修筑运河的独占权。美英两国就在加勒比海地区修筑运河问题上展开了尖锐的斗争。由于当时美国在这个地区的地位还没有稳固，不得不同英国妥协，于1850年美英两国签订了著名的克雷顿—布鲁威尔条约。美国提出保证：在计划中的巴拿马或尼加拉瓜运河必须保持中立，而且由两国在同等条件下来使用和享受这条运河的权利。
    后来，法国乘美英两国进行竞争的机会，也加入了这场斗争。1878年，法国商人维瑟以“国际海洋间运河公司”的名义，向哥伦比亚政府取得了开凿巴拿马运河的权利，聘请勒赛普（即领导开凿苏伊士运河的人）领导修筑事宜。美国对此感到万分焦急，并对法国提出警告，但没有能使法国人停止活动。到1889年，当全部工程完成五分之二的时候，由于经营不善，无力继续修筑，美国政府乘机施加压力，于1902年1月以四千万美元的代价购得了法国公司的全部财产。与此同时，美国为了独占开凿运河的权利，利用英国多事之秋，迫使英国让步。1901年，英美签订海—庞赛福条约，双方同意，由美国政府单独开凿和控制运河。这是年轻的美帝国主义在对外扩张上的一个新胜利，它排斥了英法两国而独自取得了这个富有战略意义的巴拿马运河的开凿权。
    美国在击败了英法两个对手之后，就向哥伦比亚政府提出开凿运河和永久租借运河两岸各三英里的要求。1903年8月，哥伦比亚政府拒绝了美国政府的无理要求。刚在美西战争中胜利不久的美帝国主义者，当然不甘心就此罢休，于是采取了人所共知的、而且已为殖民国家屡次用过的制造“革命”、进行干涉的手段，来达到它的抢夺目的。
    美国政府通过开凿这条运河的法律顾问克伦威尔，在哥伦比亚的巴拿马省制造暴动，然后派遣军舰阻挡哥伦比亚军队去镇压暴动。结果，巴拿马于1903年11月3日宣布脱离哥伦比亚独立。三天之后，美国总统老罗斯福就承认了巴拿马的新政府，十天之后，巴拿马的公使便在华盛顿受到接待。11月18日，就按照美国的摆布签订了“美巴条约”。这是强加在巴拿马头上的不平等的、奴役性的条约，美国以一次付清一千万美元和以后每年交付租金二十五万美元的代价，获得了运河区两岸一条十英里宽的狭长地带的永久租借权。这个十足的殖民主义性质的“美巴条约”规定，巴拿马授权美国在巴拿马的蜂腰地带永久使用、占领和控制一定的地区，以便修筑、维持、经营和保护这条两洋之间的运河。美国政府通过它所任命的运河区总督（兼巴拿马运河公司经理）对运河区进行统治。运河区的技术人员都是美国人，警察、司法和卫生工作都由美国管辖，一切建筑物属于美国政府，美国人享有治外法权，并在运河区驻有美军约两万五千人。在运河的两端——巴尔博亚港（在太平洋）和克利斯托巴耳港（在大西洋）都变成美国的海军基地。借口保卫运河，条约还规定美国在运河区以外干预巴拿马事务的权利。
    这样，面积占一千三百多平方公里的巴拿马运河区就完全置于美国殖民统治之下，形成了一个“国中之国”，严重地侵犯了巴拿马的领土和主权，并进而控制了巴拿马的政治生活，摧残和掠夺了巴拿马的经济。
    之后，美国就一方面利用巴拿马的亲美分子操纵历届选举，另一方面对它认为不如意的政权则制造政变加以推翻。因此，巴拿马在独立以来的五十六年中，共换了二十九个总统。这些当权的人物只限于一批家族和他们的支派。不论是通过选举上台或是通过暴力夺取政权，都是由美国在幕后操纵的。现任总统古阿迪亚是1956年5月大选后上台的。这个政府基本上代表美国垄断资本和本国大地主的利益，对外亲美反苏，对内执行迫害共产党、镇压罢工和摧残民主自由的反动政策。但是，在人民运动不断高涨的形势下，巴拿马政府不得不对保卫运河区主权采取一些措施。
    巴拿马是一个半殖民地和半封建性质的农业国家，经济命脉几乎完全为美帝国主义所控制。除了运河区以外，美国的联合果品公司在巴拿马拥有大量土地，控制了这个国家的香蕉生产。全国的交通、电气等公用事业，也都掌握在美国公司手中。到1955年底，美国在巴拿马的私人投资是四亿七千九百万美元，其中绝大部分投在商船公司和石油企业中。巴拿马的对外贸易也严重依赖美国，1957年，巴拿马96％的商品输往美国。
    巴拿马人口只有九十六万七千人。全国有一半地区无人居住，约有一半人口依靠在运河区工作来维持生活。但是，由于美国在运河区执行种族歧视政策，在运河区工作的美巴员工同工不同酬。美籍员工按美国标准发给“金”薪工资，巴拿马人、印第安人和其他拉丁美洲人则发给“银”薪工资。“银”薪工资只等于“金”薪工资的六分之一，因而严重地影响了巴拿马人的生活。虽然在1955年修订的“美巴条约”规定运河区美巴工人同工同酬，但是美国当局至今仍拒不执行。至于巴拿马运河和运河区的收入则绝大部分归美国所有。1958财政年度运河区的总收入高达八千三百万美元，其中运河通行费的收入为四千三百万美元，而美国给巴拿马政府的“租金”仅一百九十三万美元。此外，美国还利用对运河区的霸占和对巴拿马经济命脉的控制，运河区的美国当局不仅不买巴拿马货，反而在巴拿马全国倾销美国商品，严重地破坏了巴拿马的民族企业，并使巴拿马经济日益恶化。
    因此，在美帝国主义凌辱和掠夺下的巴拿马人民，从1903年第一个“美巴条约”签字之日起，就一直为废除这个条约和收回运河区的主权而进行坚决的斗争。1936年、1955年由于人民运动的高涨，巴拿马政府曾两度迫使美国修改“美巴条约”。1956年7月埃及把苏伊士运河收归国有，更加推动了巴拿马人民保卫运河区主权的斗争。今年以来，在古巴人民革命胜利和拉丁美洲，特别是加勒比海地区人民反美斗争日益高涨的鼓舞下，巴拿马人民反对美国霸占运河区和保卫国家主权的斗争，更加汹涌澎湃。从11月3日起巴拿马爱国者连续举行的反美大示威和两次和平进入运河区，是巴拿马人民斗争的新高潮。
    面对着巴拿马人民空前高涨的反美怒潮，美帝国主义再次暴露出它的侵略者的狰狞面貌。它一方面不断向巴拿马政府施加压力，诬蔑巴拿马人民的爱国反美示威是“暴民行动”，并威胁说这种示威“超越了保持友好关系的国家之间一向存在的礼节标准”，要求巴拿马政府“维持公共秩序”，妄图阻止巴拿马人民的正义斗争。另一方面，美帝国主义再次玩弄欺骗手法，企图用“帮助巴拿马发展经济基础的措施”来缓和巴拿马人民的反美情绪，此外，还派遣副国务卿麦钱特到巴拿马同巴拿马当局会谈，承认巴拿马政府在运河区拥有名义上的主权，答应美国为运河区购买物资时，将优先向巴拿马购买，并再次提出在局势平静后同巴拿马谈判经济问题。但是，美帝国主义这种软硬兼施的手法，并没有达到目的；11月28日巴拿马人民举行的示威游行就是最好的证明。巴拿马人民维护领土主权的斗争的高涨，是对美帝国主义的又一有力打击。（附图片）
