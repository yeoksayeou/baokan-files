    The excellent mass-created popular drama "Three Mothers" (performed by the Shanghai Chaoyang Popular Drama Troupe), which was warmly welcomed by the masses during the Shanghai Drama Festival this year, has been filmed by Haiyan Film Studio as the movie "Three Mothers," and is now being screened in Beijing.
    This film tells the story of Zhou Jianhua, the son of a construction worker who suffered through three mothers, who, after liberation, thanks to the care of the Party and the enthusiastic help of police comrades who sincerely served the people, returned to the arms of his birth mother. The old saying goes, a child is a piece of flesh that falls from the mother's body, but why was Zhou Jianhua sold to a capitalist by his mother? Did she not have maternal love? No! We will not forget the scene in the film where, on a snowy day, the heartless accountant of the Lin family carries away Jianhua, and his mother rushes out to cover his face with a small piece of clothing, sorrowfully telling Zhou's mother: "Don't tell Bao'er, he will hate us." Nor will we forget the scene where Jianhua returns from the front lines of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, participates in the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge, and takes Zhou's mother to Wuhan. Zhou's mother packs her luggage and unintentionally picks up the small piece of clothing left by Jianhua's mother, evoking twenty years of bitter memories and the joy of Jianhua's family reunion today. These two scenes alone vividly reveal the sinful essence of the old society, which prevented people from loving their loved ones and cherishing their children, and the contradiction of a mother having to sell her son. The entire film expresses Zhou's mother's noble love for others' children as well as her own, and the noble maternal love. Because she was a sufferer who bravely struggled against the evil forces in the old society, she especially loves the Party and the new society, and has the excellent quality of selflessness; it clearly shows the unparalleled warmth and superiority of the new society. After liberation, Jianhua's family turned over and lived a happy life of family reunion. Under the education of the Party, they actively worked hard to build the socialist cause. After watching the film, we cannot help but love the Party and today's happy life even more, and we must work harder to defend this victorious achievement.
    The screenwriter of this film is Comrade Wu Saiwen, who also plays Zhou's mother in the film. It is said that she just got rid of her illiteracy in 1958. The joy of cultural liberation and the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward inspired her, and the Party encouraged her. This veteran artist finally wrote the moving script of "Three Mothers" with the help of the collective and the cooperation of new literary and art workers, and created the satisfactory image of Zhou's mother, a working people's mother who has experienced hardship, is kind-hearted, and loves the Party and the new society. She once gratefully wrote: "The Party is closer than mother." We congratulate the performance of "Three Mothers."

    党比母亲还要亲
    北京永安路　海华
    今年上海戏剧会演时，受到群众热烈欢迎的一部优秀群众创作通俗话剧“三个母亲”（由上海市朝阳通俗话剧团演出），已由海燕厂拍摄成电影“三个母亲”。现正在北京上映。
    这部影片叙述一个受尽煎熬的三易母亲的建筑工人的儿子周建华，解放后，由于党的关怀，和真诚为人民服务的民警同志的热情帮助，重回到生母的怀抱的故事。老话说，儿是娘身上掉下的肉，可周建华为什么会被母亲卖给资本家呢？难道她没有母爱吗？不！我们不会忘记影片中那个大雪纷飞的日子，狠心的林家账房抱走建华，他妈奔出去用一件小衣裳盖在他脸上，悲痛地叮嘱周妈：“不要告诉宝儿，他会恨我们的。”的一段，也忘不了建华从抗美援朝前线复员回来，参加长江大桥修建工作，接周妈去武汉，周妈收拾行装，无意中拿起建华妈留下的那件小衣裳，勾引起二十多年来的辛酸回忆和喜庆今日建华一家得团圆的那一段。仅这二段就生动地揭示了旧社会叫人不得亲其亲、不得子其子的罪恶本质，和母亲不得不卖儿子的矛盾。整部影片表现了周妈崇高的幼吾幼以及人之幼的崇高母爱，唯其是在旧社会勇敢地同恶势力挣扎过来的受苦人，所以她才特别热爱党和新社会，才能有舍己为人的优秀品质；鲜明地显示了新社会的无比温暖和优越性。解放后，建华一家才翻了身，过着骨肉团聚的幸福生活，在党的教育下，积极为建设社会主义事业而辛勤工作。看了影片，使我们不能不更加热爱党和今天的幸福生活，坚决要为保卫这胜利果实而更努力地工作。
    这部影片的编剧者也就是片中扮演周妈的伍赛文同志。听说1958年她刚摘掉文盲帽子，文化翻身的喜悦、大跃进的高潮激励着她，党鼓励她，这位老艺人终于在集体的帮助和新文艺工作者的合作下，写出了“三个母亲”这个动人的剧本，令人满意地创造了周妈这一饱经忧患、心地善良、热爱党和新社会的劳动人民的母亲的形象。她曾感激地写道：“党比母亲还要亲”。我们为“三个母亲”的上演而祝贺。
