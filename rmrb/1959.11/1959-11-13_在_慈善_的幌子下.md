Under the Guise of "Charity"
    Wen Wei

The various foundations established by American monopoly capitalist groups play a very important role in American foreign aggression. These foundations usually operate under the guise of helping to develop science, education, and conducting charitable undertakings, but in reality, they not only firmly control Washington's foreign policy in various ways, but also conduct political conspiracies around the world through their foreign branches. In 1958, an American professor, Wormser, published a book analyzing various foundation organizations. In a chapter discussing the power and influence of foundations, he said: "The impact of foundation activities is nowhere greater than in the field of diplomacy. It has conquered public opinion and has largely established our country's international political goals... The influence of foundation activities in the international sphere has penetrated deeply into the government, into those who formulate congressional policy, and into the State Department."

This year, the American "Courier Magazine" in July, when discussing the influence of the American Ford Foundation on American foreign policy, also said: "By donating funds, it has placed almost all organized foreign policy discussion groups in the United States under Ford's control, and the basic public opinion of the United States on foreign affairs is constituted by these groups."

In fact, large foundations not only control diplomacy by creating "public opinion," but they themselves are also a major organized component of American foreign aggression. As everyone knows, the proportion of foreign activities in the U.S. federal government's foreign budget is not large, but in reality, the U.S. spending on foreign activities is very huge, most of which is not paid through government appropriations but is spent through private "grants." The hub for promoting these "grant" activities is the various foundation organizations that appear under the guise of "charity." Especially in the past decade, foundation organizations have played an increasingly significant role in American foreign activities.

Among the more than seven thousand foundations in the United States, the most financially strong and influential are first the Ford Foundation and then the Rockefeller Foundation. In addition, other important foundation organizations include the Carnegie Foundation, the Twentieth Century Fund, and the Woodrow Wilson Foundation. In their foreign activities, in addition to formulating and implementing some direct "grant" plans to foreign institutions or individuals, they also control many so-called private or non-governmental foreign relations organizations and groups through their funds; the latter can be divided into two categories: one is organizations with specific purposes and functions, aiming at studying certain international issues and international activities, such as the "Council on Foreign Relations" in New York, which specializes in foreign affairs research, and the other is organizations that study specific regions and countries, mostly targeting "underdeveloped countries."

The "Council on Foreign Relations" is mainly funded by three major foundations (Ford, Rockefeller, and Carnegie). The chairman is John McCloy, and the vice-chairman is David Rockefeller. This organization maintains close ties with the U.S. State Department, and many important government officials and foreign affairs experts work in this committee. The "Foreign Affairs Quarterly," which has a significant impact on American diplomacy, is published by this committee. The scope of research conducted by such institutions is very broad, covering all kinds of issues in the field of international activities, from international relations, foreign trade, international law, the activities of the United Nations, to educational and cultural exchanges between countries.

Foundations also control some foreign activity groups that represent the economic interests of businessmen, such as the "Far East Business Committee" and the "American-Asian Association," etc. These groups mostly have close ties with the government. On the one hand, they represent the interests of businessmen to study international issues, and on the other hand, they rely on funds provided by foundations to formulate many "international development plans," nominally to help "underdeveloped countries," but in reality to study the ways for American capital to penetrate into less developed regions.

A considerable portion of these foundations' grant plans is used for activities against socialist countries and the national liberation movements in Asia and Africa. As early as 1951, the Ford Foundation established a "Free Russia Fund," which was later reorganized into the "East European Fund." According to incomplete data, the total amount of funds received by this fund between 1951 and 1954 reached four billion US dollars, which were mainly used to support some reactionary exile groups in carrying out anti-communist activities. A year ago, the "Republic Fund," specially funded by the Ford Foundation, received another fifteen million US dollars to study the "Communist problem." The head of this fund is Hoffman, the former executor of the Marshall Plan and director of the Economic Cooperation Administration. In early 1958, the Rockefeller Foundation allocated 80,000 US dollars to a special school in Paris (which has special connections with intelligence agencies) to study the Soviet Union, China, and African countries. The Ford Foundation also allocated more than 70,000 US dollars to support some of the most reactionary and fiercely anti-communist socialist and labor groups in various countries. There are many cases of large foundations funding exile groups to engage in anti-Soviet and anti-communist activities. The fact is that all anti-Soviet groups in various countries can find ways to get money from foundation grants through this or that organization.

Another important activity of the foundation is to cooperate with American foreign policy in carrying out propaganda. The "Foreign Policy Association," funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, has established 500 central organizations around the world, and its propaganda pamphlets and publications flood the market. Another "Free Europe Committee," subsidized by the foundation, controls the notorious "Radio Free Europe," which has five sub-stations and uses twenty-nine relay stations in West Germany and Portugal to conduct propaganda that slanders socialist countries.

Foundations not only use literature, movies, books, exhibitions, and other methods to promote the American way of life abroad, but also use international activities to conduct propaganda. For example, in order to influence Latin American public opinion and cover up the American economic enslavement policy towards Latin America, the "National Association of Manufacturers," the largest reactionary organization of American bourgeois forces, with the support of the foundation, organized an "International Lecture Company" and sent thirty non-official citizens to various cities in Latin America to hold meetings on relations between American countries. These non-official citizens are all senior agents of American capitalists. The "grants" from the foundation to foreign groups and individuals have various purposes and extensive accounts. For example, one of the recipients of the Rockefeller Scholarship is the current British Labor Party leader Gaitskell.

Foundations play a considerable role in American foreign activities today. Their activity plans are complex and wide-ranging. They control or influence the foreign policy of the American government through naked money relations; and they promote their policies abroad unscrupulously. The characteristics of their activities are: cloaked in the guise of "charity" and "aid," working silently, yet penetrating everywhere, and vigorously carrying out their work in accordance with the will of monopoly capital.

    在“慈善”的幌子下
    汶卫
    美国大垄断资本集团所建立的各种基金会在美国对外侵略活动中起有十分重要的作用。这些基金会通常是以帮助发展科学、教育和举办慈善事业为名，但实际上它们不仅用各种方法牢牢控制着华盛顿的对外政策，而且还通过它们的国外分支机构在全世界进行政治阴谋活动。1958年美国有一位教授伍姆塞出版了一本分析各种基金会组织的书，他在谈到基金会的权力和影响的一章中说：“基金会活动所发生的影响没有比在外交方面更大的了。它已征服了舆论，而且大致上已建立了我国的国际政治目标。……基金会的活动在国际方面的影响已经深入政府，深入国会政策的订制人士，并已深入国务院。”
    今年7月份的美国“信使杂志”在谈到美国福特基金会对美国外交政策的影响时也说：“它以捐助经费的方法把美国差不多所有有组织的外交政策讨论团体都置于福特的操纵之下，而美国对外交事务的基本舆论就是由这些团体构成的”。
    其实，大的基金会不仅通过制造“舆论”来控制外交，它们本身就是美国对外侵略的一个主要有机构成部分。大家知道，在美国联邦政府的对外预算中，对外活动的费用所占比例并不大，但是实际上美国对外活动的开支非常浩大，其中多数不是以政府拨款支付，而是通过私人“赠与”的方式花掉的。推行这些“赠款”活动的枢纽，便是以“慈善”面目出现的、形形色色的基金会组织。特别是最近十年来，基金会组织在美国对外活动中起了日益显著的作用。
    在美国七千多个基金会中，基金最雄厚、势力最巨大的首先是福特基金会，其次是洛克菲勒基金会。除此以外，较重要的基金组织尚有卡内基基金会、二十世纪基金会、伍德罗·威尔逊基金会等。它们在对外活动方面除了制订和推行一些直接“赠款”给国外机构或个人的计划之外，还通过它们的基金控制着很多所谓私人的或非政府性的对外关系组织和团体；后者又可分为两类，一类是具有特定目的和作用的组织，以研究某种国际问题、国际活动为宗旨，如纽约的“对外关系委员会”专事外交事务的研究工作，另一类是以研究特定地区国家的组织，对象多半是“不发达国家”。
    “对外关系委员会”的经费来源主要靠三大基金会（福特、洛克菲勒、卡内基）供给。主席是约翰·麦克罗埃，副主席是大卫·洛克菲勒。这个组织同美国国务院保持着密切的关系，很多重要的政府官员以及外交问题专家等都在这个委员会内担任工作。对美国外交有重大影响的“外交季刊”就是由这个委员会出版。这类机构所进行的研究工作的范围很广，举凡国际活动领域内的各类问题，从国际关系、对外贸易、国际公法、联合国的活动、以至于各国教育文化交流等都在研究之列。
    基金会还控制着一些代表商人经济利益的对外活动团体，如“远东商业委员会”、“美国—亚洲协会”等等。这类团体多半同政府有密切关系，它们一方面代表商人利益来研究国际问题，另一方面还依靠基金会提供的资金制定许多“国际开发计划”，名义上是帮助“不发达国家”，实际上是研究美国资本渗入较落后地区的途径。
    这些基金会的拨款计划有相当大一部分是用来搞反对社会主义国家以及亚非地区民族解放运动的活动的。早在1951年，福特基金会便设立了一个“自由俄国基金”，以后又改组为“东欧基金”。据不完全的资料，这笔基金在1951年至1954年之间，获得的经费总数达四十亿美元，这些钱主要用来支持一些反动的流亡团体进行反共活动。一年以前，由福特基金会特别拨款设立的“共和基金”又获得一千五百万美元经费来研究“共产党问题”。这个基金的主持人是前马歇尔计划执行人、经济合作总署署长霍夫曼。洛克菲勒基金会于1958年初曾拨款八万美元给巴黎的一家特种学校（这个学校与情报机关有特殊联系）来研究苏联、中国及非洲国家。福特基金会也拨了七万多美元，支持各国的一些最反动的、反共最力的社会党及劳工团体。大基金会出钱资助流亡团体从事反苏反共活动者不在少数，事实是，各国的一切反苏团体都能设法通过这种或那种组织从基金会的拨款中分到钱。
    基金会的另一重要活动是配合美国外交政策进行宣传。由洛克菲勒基金会和卡内基基金会提供经费的“外交政策协会”曾在世界各地成立有五百个中心组织，它们出版的宣传小册子和刊物充斥市场。另一个得到基金会津贴的“自由欧洲委员会”控制着臭名远扬的“自由欧洲电台”，这个电台又设了五个分台，并在西德和葡萄牙通过二十九个转播站，大肆进行诬蔑社会主义国家的宣传。
    基金会不仅利用文学、电影、书刊、展览等等方式在国外宣传美国生活方式，它还利用国际性的活动进行宣传。例如，为了影响拉丁美洲的舆论，为美国对拉丁美洲的经济奴役政策进行掩饰，美国资产阶级势力最大的反动组织“全国制造商协会”就在基金会的支持下组织了一个“国际讲座公司”，派遣了三十名非官方公民到拉丁美洲各城市去举行有关美洲国家关系的会议，这些非官方公民都是美国大资本家的高级代理人。基金会向国外各团体及个人所“赠”的款名目繁多，户头广泛。譬如接受过洛克菲勒奖学金的人物中就有当前英国的工党领袖盖茨克尔在内。
    基金会在今天的美国对外活动中起着相当大的作用，它的活动计划繁复，范围广泛；它通过赤裸裸的金钱关系，来控制或影响美国政府的对外政策；并肆无忌惮地向国外推行它的政策；它进行活动的特点是：披着“慈善”、“援助”的外衣，不动声色、然而无孔不钻地遵循着垄断资本的旨意大力开展工作。
