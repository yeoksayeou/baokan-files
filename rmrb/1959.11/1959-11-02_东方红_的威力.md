    The Power of "The East is Red"
    Chen Jian
    When "The East is Red," dressed in a beautiful rose-red coat, drove from the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant to Erlangmiao Village, Luonan People's Commune in the outskirts of Luoyang City, it was precisely the time when the village was deeply plowing the land day and night to prepare for autumn sowing. Because this was irrigated land, the soil was hard and difficult to plow, and on average, each person could only plow three to four fen per day and night. Amidst the cheers of the commune members, "The East is Red" sped to the fields and worked continuously for four days and nights, plowing most of the village's land. The accountant calculated, and wow! Her twenty hours of work were more than twice the total work done by three hundred commune members day and night. The loudspeaker immediately announced the completion of the plowing task ten days ahead of schedule, and hundreds of poems praising the working class emerged in the blink of an eye.
    While plowing, the children followed behind "her," and if they were not careful, they would fall. The adults would exclaim: falling into the ditch, quickly get up! In reality, they fell into the furrow, because "The East is Red" plowed the land a full one foot and three inches deep. The elderly who had been bedridden for many years and those who no longer worked in the fields were summoned by the power of "The East is Red" to the edge of the field. They grabbed a handful of soil, and the soil slipped through their fingers. How wonderful! Ma Youwu, an old farmer who had farmed with hoes and plows all his life and broken his back, told the young people: "You don't know how many spines the older generation broke and how much sweat they shed holding hoes and plows. 'The East is Red' knows, and she has suddenly shouldered the heavy burden of generations. You lucky young fellows!"

    “东方红”的威力
    陈健
    穿着一身漂亮的玫瑰红衣裳的“东方红”从第一拖拉机制造厂开到洛阳市郊洛南人民公社二郎庙村的时候，正是这个村日夜深翻土地，准备秋播的时候。因这里是水浇地，地硬、难翻，平均每人一昼夜只能翻三、四分。“东方红”在社员一片欢呼声中，急驰到地里，连续工作四昼夜，犁完全村大部分土地。会计员一算，嗬！她二十个小时的工作量，比三百名社员昼夜干的总和还大一倍多。广播筒马上宣布提早十天完成翻地任务，几百首歌颂工人阶级的诗篇，眨眼之间出来了。
    翻地时，孩子们跟在“她”的屁股后头，一不留神，跌倒了，大人惊叫一声：掉沟里了，快爬起来，其实，是掉到垅里了，因为“东方红”翻的地足有一尺三寸深。多年卧病不起的和已经不下地的老人，被“东方红”的威力呼唤到地头来，他们抓过一把土，土从手缝中漏完了。多妙啊！麻酉戊，这位用锄头、犁耙种了一辈子地、累断了腰的老农民，告诉青年人：“你们不知道老一辈的人累断过多少脊梁筋，抱着锄头犁耙流过多少汗，“东方红”知道，她一下子就把世世代代的重担子挑起了，你们这些幸福的小伙子呀！”
