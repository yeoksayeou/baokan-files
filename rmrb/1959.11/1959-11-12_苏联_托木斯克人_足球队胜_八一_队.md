Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: The Soviet "Tomsk People" football team, braving the cold wind at the Xian Nong Tan Stadium in Beijing today, defeated the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" football team with a score of 2-1.

Despite the strong wind today, the competition between the two sides was fierce and exciting. In the first half, the visiting team played with the wind at their backs. Fifteen minutes into the game, the visiting team's right winger, Mokhov, took advantage of the "August 1st" team's goalkeeper Huang Zhaowen running out to save the ball and not being able to retreat in time, shooting a long-range shot from 30 meters into the empty net, taking a 1-0 lead. However, only fifteen minutes later, the visiting team's right back, Sukhanov, committed a handball foul in the penalty area. When the "August 1st" team's right midfielder, Wang Xiweng, took the penalty kick, he kicked the ball into the net, tying the score at 1-1.

In the second half, the "August 1st" team had the advantage of playing with the wind and launched a fierce attack at the beginning. However, in the 20th minute, the visiting team took advantage of the home team's defensive gap to score another goal, taking a 2-1 lead. At that time, the visiting team's winger, A. Chintsov, quickly dribbled the ball along the sideline. As he approached the end line, he passed the ball to the left inside forward, Topchinko, who feinted past the home team's defender and unleashed a powerful shot, once again leaving Huang Zhaowen unable to save it. This rapid offensive earned enthusiastic applause from the audience.

After conceding a goal, the "August 1st" team worked hard to counterattack and gained many opportunities to take corner kicks and shoot, but the forwards were somewhat impatient and their shots were inaccurate. In addition, the visiting team marked them tightly, so they were never able to tie the score again.

The Soviet "Tomsk People" football team will also hold a friendly match with the Beijing football team in Beijing on the 15th.

    苏联“托木斯克人”足球队胜“八一”队
    新华社11日讯　苏联“托木斯克人”足球队今天在北京先农坛体育场冒着寒风，以二比一战胜了中国人民解放军“八一”足球队。
    尽管今天风很大，但双方争夺激烈，踢得精采。上半场客队踢顺风，比赛进行了一刻钟时，客队右边锋莫霍夫乘“八一”队守门员黄肇文跑出救球来不及回守的机会，从三十米外远射入空门一球，以一比零领先。但才过了一刻钟，客队右后卫苏哈诺夫在禁区内手碰球犯规，“八一”队右前卫王锡文主罚“十一米球”时，踢球入网，扳成一平。
    下半场“八一”队处于顺风的有利条件下，开头攻势猛烈，但到第二十分钟时，客队又乘主队后防空虚的机会攻入一球，以二比一领先。当时客队边锋阿·钦佐夫沿边线快速带球前进，他快跑到端线时，把球传给了左内锋托普钦科，托幌过了主队后卫一脚劲射，又使黄肇文扑救不及，这一快速的攻势博得观众的热烈掌声。
    “八一”队失球后努力反攻，多次获得发“角球”和射门的机会，但前锋有些急躁，射门不准，加上客队盯人很紧，始终没有能再次扳成平局。
    苏联“托木斯克人”足球队15日还将在北京同北京足球队举行友谊比赛。
