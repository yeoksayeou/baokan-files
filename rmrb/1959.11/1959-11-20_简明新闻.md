　　Beijing Municipal Party Committee Calls for Cherishing Vegetables

　　Beijing's suburban areas have harvested a bumper crop of 250,000 mu of Chinese cabbage. The total yield is expected to be about 1 billion jin of cleaned vegetables, more than double the output of last year. This year's bumper harvest of Chinese cabbage in Beijing was achieved by overcoming severe waterlogging. To this end, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee requires the people of the city to learn to live frugally and cherish vegetables: store good vegetables, eat cabbage stalks and leaves first or process them by pickling and drying. It also requires that institutions, factories, schools, residents, and people's communes, all take action and every household stores vegetables to ensure that there are enough vegetables to eat this winter and next spring.

　　Ewes Lamb Twice a Year

　　A batch of ewes in Changmu People's Commune in Guide County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and Sujitan People's Commune in Menyuan Hui Autonomous County, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, have achieved high yields by lambing twice a year. From last winter to this summer, 255 ewes in the Gaohongya Brigade of the Changmu People's Commune produced a total of 398 winter and summer lambs, with 398 surviving; 700 ewes in the First Brigade of the Sujitan People's Commune produced 774 lambs, with 769 surviving.

　　The Qinghai grasslands are high and cold, and the growing season for pasture is short. Generally, ewes lamb once a year in winter and spring.

　　Nanping Special District Achieves Great Results in Secondary Autumn Harvest

　　The Nanping Special District in the mountainous area of northern Fujian Province, while concentrating on the rush harvesting of late rice, launched a secondary autumn harvest campaign focused on re-threshing rice straw. The district organized more than 10,000 professional teams for re-threshing rice straw and gathering grain, and has re-threshed more than 1.07 million mu of rice straw, yielding more than 9.75 million jin of grain.

　　Leping County Establishes Livestock Farms in Mountain Hollows

　　In Leping County, Jiangxi Province, more than 150,000 mu of cultivated land are located in mountain hollows, far from villages, with little fertilizer applied, and low yields. Recently, the communes have established livestock farms in the mountain hollows of these low-yield fields to fertilize the land with livestock.

　　More than 7,200 commune members in the county have entered the mountain hollows to build farms. 658 livestock farms have been built, with more than 2,000 head of cattle, 4,624 pigs, and many chickens, geese, ducks and other poultry.
