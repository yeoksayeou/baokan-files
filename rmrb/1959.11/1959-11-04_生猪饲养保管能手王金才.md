Wang Jincai is the leader of the hog raising and caretaking group of the Xuzhou Special District Livestock Bureau Food Management Department in Jiangsu Province. He is a Communist Party member who is both red and expert. Born into a poor peasant family, he lost his parents at a young age. Before liberation, he lived a life of hardship as a long-term worker, fleeing famine, begging, and working as a shop assistant, suffering exploitation by landlords and capitalists. Only after the liberation of Xuzhou did he begin to live a true human life.

Under the Party's cultivation and education and with the help of comrades, Wang Jincai's class consciousness has continuously improved, and he has made rapid progress, making outstanding achievements in the work of raising and caring for hogs. Since 1955 alone, he has saved more than 1.5 million jin of refined feed and increased hog weight by 350,000 jin by using green substitute feed. He and his group members have also collectively created and promoted more than 120 advanced experiences, increasing production and saving a large amount of wealth for the country, and creating a new record of keeping more than 130,000 hogs without a single death for twenty-seven consecutive months since May 1957. Wang Jincai has won the title of labor model and advanced worker at the national, provincial, special district, municipal, and unit levels 58 times. In 1956, he attended the National Congress of Advanced Producers and had the honor of meeting Chairman Mao. The group he led has also been rated as an advanced collective 25 times.

Wang Jincai often says: "Loving pigs is building socialism." Regardless of day or night, wind or rain, cold winter or hot summer, he is always busy for the pigs, always concerned about their safety. Wang Jincai treats pigs with the same patience and care as a loving mother cares for her children. Before feeding the pigs each time, he always checks the feed, picks out any grass stalks, and crushes any lumps of feed with his hands. He is afraid that the pigs will not like to eat cold food, so he cooks the feed before feeding them. He always feeds them a thin gruel first to stimulate their appetite, and then feeds them a thicker feed. Through years of observation and experimentation, he has figured out the pigs' appetites. According to their preferences, he often feeds them melons in the summer and carrots and sugar residue in the winter, and appropriately adds some salt to the feed to enhance their appetite. In the winter, he pads the pigsty with straw and surrounds it with straw curtains to protect the pigs from safely getting through the winter; in the summer, he builds shelters for the pigs, opens windows, and often sprinkles water in the pen to lower the temperature. Wang Jincai is not only an excellent feeder but also a good veterinarian. He takes the pigs' temperature, wipes their eye mucus, treats their sores, feeds the sick pigs good feed, and drives the sick pigs to the field to exercise and breathe fresh air. With his rich pig raising experience and patient care, he has cured more than 1,000 sick and injured pigs in the past few years.

It is common for pig farmers to hit pigs. When Wang Jincai used to work as a shop assistant in a pig shop opened by capitalists, he often hit and kicked pigs. After liberation, at the Shanghai Frozen Meat Processing Factory, he saw that pigs that had been hit with sticks had scars on their bodies, which affected the growth and quality of the meat. From then on, he never hit pigs again, and he patiently persuaded others not to hit or kick them either. At the same time, he introduced the experience of how to manage pigs well without hitting or kicking them, which eliminated the phenomenon of hitting pigs in their group and warehouse. He also trained several "lead pigs." When driving and loading trains, he let the "lead pigs" walk in front, and the pig herd followed steadily and got on the train. Since then, not only has the chaotic phenomenon of forced loading and hard hitting been changed, but also manpower and time have been greatly saved. In order to reduce disease and increase weight and fat, he pays great attention to the environmental hygiene of the pigsty, cleans the pigsty thoroughly, and disinfects it regularly. Pigs biting each other will affect their rest and prevent them from gaining weight. After several days and nights of careful observation, he finally discovered the secret of biting and adopted the method of dividing the pigs into pens according to their region of origin, size, strength, and sex. In this way, the phenomenon of biting has been greatly reduced, and each pig is raised to be fat and strong.

Wang Jincai and his group not only work hard and practically, but also cleverly. From 1953 to 1958, they created and successfully promoted more than 120 advanced experiences and working methods, such as the "four-person responsibility system," "lead pigs," "feeding pigs with cattle, horse, and sheep manure," "scientific fattening method," "four-part custody method," "expanded utilization of substitute feed," "grain-free wine steaming," "automatic feeder," and "automatic water supply method," which greatly improved the quality and efficiency of work. Take the scientific fattening method as an example! Since this year, Wang Jincai and his group members decided to "massively increase production." In addition to widely adopting methods such as cutting ears, cutting the thyroid gland, and injecting milk, they also successfully tested the "black room fattening method." Wang Jincai thought: "Pigs eat and sleep when they are full and have no worries, so they grow fast. If you put pigs in a dark room, making daytime into night, wouldn't they be able to sleep more and grow faster?" With the strong support of the Party, this idea was successfully tested. In the first quarter, 1,300 hogs were fattened in batches using this method, with each hog gaining 2.5 jin per day, and some hogs gaining 5.25 jin per day. All the fattened hogs gained a total of more than 9,300 jin.

In addition, during the increase production and economize movement, they put forward the slogan of "Do whatever you do, innovate in whatever you do" and created 29 tools such as "automatic door openers" and "wind-powered double-sided automatic feeders," which have played a certain role in improving work efficiency.

In the past few years, Wang Jincai and his group have done everything possible to use green substitute feed, which has greatly saved refined feed. In April 1958, after the Party branch told Wang Jincai about the experience of Heshan County, Guangdong Province, in feeding pigs with cattle manure, he and his group members seriously studied and actively promoted it, and succeeded after two tests. However, they were not satisfied with this experience and successively tested and succeeded in feeding pigs with sheep, horse, and donkey manure. The workers were very happy and composed a piece of quick verse to sing: "Advanced experience is a treasure, feeding pigs with animal manure can increase fat; our warehouse has it, no need to look for it elsewhere, it really saves money and materials." During the Spring Festival this year, because the inventory was large, the supply of refined feed could not meet the demand, which brought difficulties to the work of feeding and caring for hogs. In order to make sure that the pigs were fed well, Wang Jincai collected coarse feed everywhere, but it still could not meet the needs. At this time, Wang Jincai and the comrades in the group studied together and finally came up with the idea of using green substitute feed to distill liquor. The liquor produced can offset all the raw materials and labor costs, and the distiller's grains are used to raise pigs, so the pigs eat without spending money, and the difficulty of not having refined feed is basically solved. In the past seven months, more than 300,000 jin of substitute feed have been used, saving more than 150,000 jin of soybean cake and bran. Using substitute feed to feed pigs not only saves a large amount of wealth for the country but also achieves the regulation of maintaining fat within two days and increasing weight and fat within three days after the hogs eat. From January to July, liquor was distilled 50 times. In addition to meeting the needs of the warehouse, 15,000 jin were sold to support brother units. At the same time, more than 2,600 jin of white wine and various fruit wines were brewed, increasing revenue for the country.

Supporting pig production and carrying out communist cooperation is the consistent working style of Wang Jincai and his group. In order to support the development of pig raising in rural areas, Wang Jincai often goes deep into the people's communes to help with work. Many people from various places come to their group to visit and request to make reports. He always patiently and thoroughly introduces his experience. Since this year, in response to the call of the provincial and regional committees to develop hogs, they have taken improving production as one of their main tasks, regarding the difficulties of others in raising pigs as their own, and proactively sending technology to the door, going to nearby people's communes, government agencies, troops, schools, people's organizations, and other breeding units to help establish breeding bases. They also impart the experience accumulated over the years to pig farmers without reservation, which is welcomed by the masses.

    生猪饲养保管能手王金才
    王金才是江苏省徐州专区畜业局食品经理部的生猪饲养保管组长，是一位又红又专的共产党员。这个贫农出身的儿子，幼年时代就失去了父母，解放前一直过着做长工、逃荒、讨饭、当伙计的辛酸生活，受尽地主、资本家的剥削，直到徐州解放，他才开始了真正的人的生活。
    王金才在党的培养教育和同志们的帮助下，阶级觉悟不断提高，进步很快，在饲养保管生猪工作中作出了出色的成绩。仅从1955年以来，由于他采用青代饲料喂猪，就节约了精饲料一百五十多万斤，使生猪增膘三十五万斤。他还和小组的同志们集体创造和推广了一百二十多条先进经验，为国家增产和节约了大量的财富，并创造了1957年5月以来连续二十七个月保管生猪十三万多头无一死亡的新纪录。王金才曾先后五十八次荣获全国、省、专区、市和本单位的劳动模范、先进工作者的称号，1956年他出席全国先进生产者代表大会，光荣地会见了毛主席。他所领导的小组也曾二十五次被评为先进集体。
    王金才常说：“我爱护猪就是建设社会主义”。不论白天黑夜，刮风下雨，寒冬炎夏，他总是为猪忙着，时刻惦念着猪的安全。王金才对待猪就像慈母爱护孩子一样的耐心细致。每次喂猪以前，他总要把饲料检查一遍，有草棒就随手拣掉，成块的饲料就用手捏碎。他怕猪不喜欢吃冷食，就把饲料煮熟后再喂。他总是先喂一遍稀料，助长猪的食欲，然后再喂稠料。经过长年累月的观察、试验，他摸清了猪的胃口，就根据猪的喜好，在夏季经常喂些瓜类，冬季喂些胡萝卜、糖渣，并且在饲料里适当地放些盐，以增强猪的食欲。冬天，他给猪圈里垫草，四周围上草帘，保护猪安全过冬；夏天，他给猪搭凉棚，开窗户，经常向圈内洒水，降低温度。王金才不仅是个优秀的饲养员，也是个好兽医。他给猪量体温、擦眼屎、治恶疮，给病猪好的饲料吃，把病猪赶到场外活动，呼吸新鲜空气。就凭他这丰富的养猪经验和耐心的照顾，几年来，养好的病猪伤猪已有一千多头。
    养猪的人打猪，这是常有的事。王金才过去在资本家开的猪行里当伙计的时候，也常打猪、踢猪。解放后，在上海冻肉加工厂，他看到用棍子打过的猪，身上有伤痕，影响了猪的生长和肉的质量。从那以后，他再也不打猪了，而且耐心地劝说别人也不打不踢，同时介绍了不打不踢照样能把猪管好的经验，使他们组里、仓库里消除了打猪现象。他又训练出几头“带头猪”，在赶运和装火车的时候，让“带头猪”走在前面，猪群就安安稳稳地跟着走路和上车，从此，不仅改变了强装、硬打等混乱现象，而且大大节省了人力和时间。为了让猪减少疾病，增重长膘，他非常讲究猪圈的环境卫生，把猪圈打扫得干干净净，经常消毒。猪咬架会影响休息，长不上膘。他经过几昼夜的细心观察，终于发现了咬架的秘密，采用了分地区（猪的来路）、分大小、分强弱、分公母的办法分圈饲养，这样一来，咬架现象大大减少，一个个养得肥头胖耳，膘足体壮。
    王金才和他的小组在工作中不仅苦干、实干，而且也巧干。他从1953年到1958年，共创造和成功地推广了“四员负责制”、“带头猪”、“牛马羊粪喂猪”、“科学催肥法”、“四分保管法”、“扩大利用代饲料”、“无粮蒸酒”、“自动下食器”、“自动送水法”等一百二十多种先进经验和工作法，大大提高了工作质量和工作效率。就拿科学催肥法来说吧！今年以来，王金才和小组的同志们决定要“大面积丰产”，除了广泛采用割耳、割甲状腺和注射牛奶等方法以外，还试验成功“黑房育肥法”。王金才想：“猪这个玩意儿，吃饱就睡，没有心事，因此长得快。如果把猪关在黑房子里，白天当黑夜，不是能睡的时间更多，长得更快吗？”在党的大力支持下，这个想法试验成功了，第一季度用这种方法分批催肥一千三百头生猪，每头每天增重二点五斤，其中有的猪一天增重五点二五斤。全部催肥生猪共长膘九千三百多斤。
    此外，他们在增产节约运动中，提出了“干什么，革新什么”的口号，又创造了“自动开关门”、“风力牵引双面自动下食器”等二十九件工具，对提高工作效率都起了一定作用。
    几年来，王金才和他的小组千方百计地利用青代饲料，大大地节约了精饲料。1958年4月，党支部把广东省鹤山县利用牛粪喂猪的经验告诉给王金才以后，他和小组的同志们就认真学习，积极推广，经过两次试验就成功了。但是，他们并没有满足这种经验，先后又试验成功了用羊、马、驴粪喂猪的方法。工人们非常高兴，自己编了一段快板唱道：“先进经验是个宝，畜粪喂猪能长膘；本仓库就有，不用外地找，真是省钱又省料。”今年春节期间，因为库存量大，精饲料供不应求，这给饲养和保管生猪工作带来了困难。王金才为了使猪吃饱吃好，到各处采集粗饲料，可是还不能满足需要。这时，王金才和组里的同志们一道研究，终于想出了利用青代饲料蒸酒，出的酒可抵全部原料和人工费用，净赚酒糟养猪，使猪吃食不花钱，而且基本上解决了没有精饲料的困难。七个多月来，利用代饲料三十多万斤，共节约豆饼、麸皮十五万多斤。利用代饲料喂猪，不但为国家节约了大笔财富，同时也达到了生猪进食后两日内保膘、三日内增重长膘的规定。1至7月份共蒸酒五十次，除满足了仓库的猪食需要以外，出售了一万五千斤，支援了兄弟单位。同时还酿出白酒以及各种果露酒二千六百多斤，为国家增加了收入。
    支援养猪生产、大搞共产主义协作，是王金才和他的小组一贯的工作作风。为了支援农村发展养猪，王金才经常深入人民公社帮助工作。各地来他们小组参观访问和要求去作报告的人也很多，他总是耐心地详细地介绍经验。今年以来，他们响应省委、地委发展生猪的号召，把提高生产作为主要的任务之一，把别人养猪的困难看作自己的困难，主动地送技术上门，到附近人民公社、机关、部队、学校、人民团体等饲养单位，帮助建立饲养基地。他们还把几年来积累起来的经验，毫无保留地传授给养猪户，受到广大群众的欢迎。
