Economic Contradictions in Western Europe are Developing
Yang Zhanlin

Two Opposing Economic Groups

The establishment on January 1 this year of the "Common Market" by six Western European countries led by West Germany, and the concretization in July of the "Small Free Trade Area" plan of seven Western European countries led by Britain, have created two opposing economic and trade fortresses in Western Europe. This intensification of economic and trade warfare has made the contradictions within the imperialist camp even more acute.

The establishment of the six-nation "Common Market" is a serious blow to Britain. As we all know, Britain is a country that relies heavily on foreign trade. Britain's foreign markets are mainly two: the Sterling Area and Western Europe. One-half of Britain's exports are to the Sterling Area, and one-quarter are to Western Europe, with goods exported to the "Common Market" six countries accounting for more than half of its exports to the Western European market. However, since the war, due to the law of uneven development of capitalism, the rising West Germany has been squeezing Britain's trade position in various markets in the capitalist world, and West Germany has already defeated Britain and taken the lead in the Western European market. Now, West Germany and France, together with the other four countries, have organized a "Common Market" that excludes Britain, further challenging Britain's economic and political status.

In order to counter the six-nation "Common Market" group led by West Germany, to change the unfavorable situation for itself, and to further increase its capital for competing with West Germany for leadership in Western Europe, as early as October last year, when negotiations on Britain's original "Free Trade Area" plan showed clear signs of breaking down, Britain held a secret meeting in London with non-"Common Market" member states to brew the formation of a "Small Free Trade Area." The "Small Free Trade Area" will implement the principles of the "Free Trade Area" plan previously proposed by Britain. That is, gradually reduce tariffs on industrial products among member states until they are completely eliminated. At the same time, agricultural products are not included. In terms of external tariffs, each country can still freely decide its tax rates. This will facilitate the occupation of these countries' markets by British industrial products, while at the same time not harming Britain's "Imperial Preference" with the Commonwealth countries.

Under the leadership of Britain and Sweden, experts from the seven countries finally held a meeting in Stockholm in June to discuss the issue of establishing a "Small Free Trade Area" as soon as possible, and drafted a draft plan. From July 20 to 21, the seven countries held a ministerial meeting in Stockholm to discuss the draft plan, and issued a communique after the meeting, formally recommending to their respective governments the establishment of a "European Free Trade Association," and also adopted the "Draft Plan for the Establishment of a European Free Trade Association," and decided to draft an agreement on the basis of this draft. Current news indicates that after the agreement is ratified, it is expected to take effect on January 1, 1960, and the first tariff reduction of 20% will be implemented on July 1 of the same year. At this point, following the collapse of the European Payments Union, Western European countries have officially split into two opposing economic groups, and the contradictions among capitalist countries have entered a new stage.

Open Strife and Covert Struggle

However, the true purpose of Britain's active preparation for the "Small Free Trade Area" is more political than economic. Because the "Small Free Trade Area" will lead to a long-term split in Western Europe into two major groups, the "Common Market" and the "Small Free Trade Area," which means that Britain will retreat from its leading position in Western Europe to within the seven countries of the "Small Free Trade Area." This is certainly not what Britain wants. Britain's real intention in preparing for the "Small Free Trade Area" is to put pressure on the six countries of the "Common Market," forcing them to reconsider Britain's previously proposed large "Free Trade Area" plan. British newspapers have unreservedly admitted this. The British "Economist" magazine frankly pointed out that Britain can put pressure on West German exporters who own the Scandinavian market by establishing a seven-nation "Free Trade Area," and then they will probably put pressure on France, which will force the "Common Market" to accept a broader agreement with Britain in Europe.

Indeed, this move by Britain is quite fierce against West Germany. Because the economic relationship between West Germany and the six countries of the "Small Free Trade Area" other than Britain is very close. Of West Germany's foreign trade, 30% is exported to the "Common Market" countries, and 28% is exported to the seven countries of the "Small Free Trade Area." West German automobile exports to the seven countries of the "Small Free Trade Area" are twice the amount exported to the five countries of the "Common Market." At present, West Germany's steel, metal products, machinery, vehicles, chemicals, etc. all occupy a considerable advantage in these regions. Therefore, Britain's organization of the "Small Free Trade Area" will greatly damage West Germany's interests in this region. Originally, West Germany was not absolutely opposed to Britain's "Free Trade Area" plan. It wanted to rely on its strong economic potential to control the "Common Market" countries on the one hand, and at the same time use Britain's "Free Trade Area" plan to enter Britain's sphere of influence. But it was only because of France's strong opposition, considering the current role of the Paris-Bonn axis, that it did not agree to Britain's plan. Now that Britain's "Small Free Trade Area" is putting such pressure, West Germany's attitude cannot but waver. Not long ago, a research document from the West German Ministry of Economic Affairs warned that if a bridge is not built between the "Common Market" and the "Small Free Trade Area," it will inevitably suffer "serious losses," especially West Germany.

Not only that, in order to counter the "Common Market," in addition to preparing for the establishment of the "Small Free Trade Area," Britain is also conducting economic infiltration of the "Common Market." British companies are increasingly stepping up their activities in establishing new bases or expanding existing enterprises in France and Italy. The British "Manchester Guardian" once said that this is a "reasonable answer to the exclusion of countries outside the six-nation alliance."

Of course, the "Common Market" countries, especially West Germany, will not relax their intrusion into the "Small Free Trade Area" countries. Since the beginning of this year, they have also strengthened their investment activities within the "Small Free Trade Area." Among the Nordic countries participating in the "Small Free Trade Area" group, Denmark is an industrially weak country, and investing in Denmark is not only profitable, but also allows products to be smoothly exported to Sweden and Norway. Therefore, member states of the six-nation group, such as West Germany, are exporting capital to Denmark. In order to counter the investment of the six-nation group, the countries of the seven-nation group, led by Britain, have also stepped up their capital exports to Denmark. According to foreign newspapers, in the first half of this year, the total amount of foreign capital flowing into Denmark reached 33 million Danish Kroner, of which Sweden, Norway, Britain, etc. accounted for 7.5 million Danish Kroner, and West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, etc. accounted for 19 million Danish Kroner.

It can be seen that with the establishment of the "Small Free Trade Area," the battle for dominance between the two major economic and trade groups is becoming increasingly fierce.

Internal Contradictions of the "Common Market"

The reason why Britain wants to use the establishment of the "Small Free Trade Area" to put pressure on the Common Market is that Britain has accurately recognized that the "Common Market" is full of internal contradictions and sharp conflicts of interest, which can be used to disintegrate the "Common Market."

In fact, since the "Common Market" officially opened in January this year, there have been several quarrels internally. Originally, the "Common Market" treaty stipulates that import taxes should be gradually abolished among the six countries, but in order to prevent a large influx of certain commodities, the governments of the six countries increased the consumption tax on these commodities after their first tariff reduction and increase in import quotas, thereby offsetting the effect of the tariff reduction. Italy even refused to increase the quota for importing automobiles from West Germany and France as stipulated in the treaty, nor was it willing to import more coal from Belgium and West Germany to ease the coal crisis of the "Coal and Steel Community" group. On the contrary, it continued to import British automobiles and American coal. This actually violated the "Common Market" agreement.

As we all know, the "Common Market" was established at a time when the "Common Market" six countries were experiencing a crisis in coal and steel production. Coal production in various countries was excessive, especially West Germany and Belgium, whose unsold coal piled up like mountains, a large number of mines were closed, and workers were laid off. At that time, Belgium had been requesting the "High Authority" of the "Coal and Steel Community" to declare the coal industry to be in a "crisis state" in order to reduce coal production and make it easier for Belgian coal to be sold. However, other countries were unwilling to declare the coal industry to be in a "crisis state" due to the situation of the coal industry crisis and wanted to get rid of their own difficulties, forcing Belgium to clamor to temporarily withdraw from the "Community." On the issue of steel, since France took advantage of the devaluation of the French franc at the end of last year to vigorously sell French steel to West Germany and other countries, West Germany unceremoniously forced France to levy a 4% export tax on steel through the High Authority of the "Coal and Steel Community." France was dissatisfied and rejected West Germany's request.

With the active preparation for the "Small Free Trade Area," the internal contradictions of the six countries of the "Common Market" have been further sharpened. West Germany's attempt to temporarily adjust relations with Britain was opposed by France. Since France's industrial competitiveness is not as good as that of Britain, for example, the price of French machinery equipment is on average 15% to 20% higher than that of West Germany and Britain, and ships are one-third higher. French industrial products do not hope to find a way out in the traditional British market to expand foreign markets, but first want to maintain their domestic market. But France is a major exporter of agricultural products and needs to expand its overseas markets; while the "Free Trade Area" plan only includes industrial products and not agricultural products, which allows the competitive British industrial products to freely enter the French market, but French agricultural products cannot expand their overseas markets. For France, the "Free Trade Area" plan is only harmful and not beneficial. Therefore, France firmly refused to negotiate with Britain on a large "Free Trade Area." However, West Germany recently prepared a new proposal on the establishment of a European "Free Trade Area" regardless of France's opposition, and submitted it to the "Council of Europe" held in Strasbourg on September 16. The proposal advocates that the "Free Trade Area" includes the six countries of the "Common Market," the seven countries of the "Small Free Trade Area," and countries that do not participate in the group, such as Ireland, Greece, Turkey, and Spain. At the same time, the agent of West German monopoly capital, the chairman of the "Common Market" Executive Committee, the West German Hallstein, expounded his plan for developing a "European Economic Union" at the autumn meeting of the "Common Market" Parliament held in Strasbourg on September 24.

In addition to West Germany, since the Netherlands considered that the establishment of the "Small Free Trade Area" would cause Danish agricultural products to be robbed of the Dutch market in Britain, it also advocated reopening negotiations on the large "Free Trade Area." At the Strasbourg meeting, the Dutch representative argued that the two groups needed to unite. He also criticized the "Common Market" executive body for its ambiguous attitude on multilateral union issues. He said that France's hesitation on this issue should not cause other countries to abandon it as well.

It can be seen that with the establishment of the "Small Free Trade Area," the internal contradictions of the "Common Market" are developing day by day.

The Seven-Nation Group with Different Dreams in the Same Bed

The "Small Free Trade Area" is also full of contradictions. Weak economic strength and geographical dispersion are the weaknesses of the "Small Free Trade Area." The "Common Market" has a population of more than 160 million, and its industrial production accounts for 21.6% of the industrial production of Western countries, and its exports account for 24.1%. The "Small Free Trade Area" has a population of only 88 million, and its industrial production accounts for only 11.3%, and its exports account for only 16.8%. More seriously, the imbalance in the economic development of the seven countries is even more serious than that of the six countries. This determines that the internal relations of this seven-nation group are unstable.

In the process of preparation, the countries that actively supported the "Small Free Trade Area" plan were actually only the industrially developed countries that are not afraid of free competition, such as Britain, Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway. Denmark was the first to express doubts about the plan, because Denmark is a country that has always exported a large number of agricultural products to both Britain and West Germany at the same time (exports to Britain account for 40% of Denmark's total exports, and exports to West Germany account for 30%). At the same time, as a mainly agricultural exporting country, Denmark is also afraid that participating in a "Free Trade Area" of industrial products will be detrimental to its domestic industry, while its agricultural exports cannot get any benefits.

The trade volume between all the countries participating in the seven-nation group, including Britain, and the "Common Market" countries is greater than the trade volume between them. For example, half of Austria's imports and exports are with the six countries, and the goods Austria sells to the six countries are four times the goods it sells to the seven countries. Similarly, the goods Switzerland sells to the six countries are three times the goods it sells to the seven countries. This makes these countries have varying degrees of concern about participating in the "Small Free Trade Area."

In order to promote the establishment of the "Small Free Trade Area," Britain had to conduct bilateral contacts with Denmark and made some concessions, agreeing to abolish tariffs on Danish exports to Britain of bacon (accounting for half of the total value of agricultural products exported by Denmark to Britain) and cheese within two years from July 1, 1960. This means that Britain sacrificed one million pounds a year in exchange for Denmark's agreement to join the seven-nation group. However, although the Danish agricultural exports to Britain have received special regulations, its industrial products have attracted fierce competition and are in danger of being swallowed up, which cannot but cause concern among the Danish industrial community. In order to reduce the attack from foreign competition, the Danish Industrial Federation has asked its government to increase the tariffs on some major industrial products by 22.5% to 25%. This move by the Danish industrial community may cause a chain reaction in other member states.

Norway, which is more industrially developed and whose fishery products account for a large proportion of its exports, is very dissatisfied that Britain has only made special arrangements for the export of Danish agricultural products, but has not made any arrangements for fishery products. The Norwegian Labor Party's organ "Workers' Newspaper" recently criticized Britain's policy on fishery products in the "Small Free Trade Area." The newspaper pointed out that if Britain does not change this policy, Norway will lose out in an important sector of the "Free Trade Area." This reflects Norway's contradiction with Britain on the "Small Free Trade Area" issue.

Due to the intricate internal contradictions, it seems that the "Small Free Trade Area" will encounter many difficulties in the implementation process.

It can be seen from the struggle between the "Common Market" and the "Small Free Trade Area" that Western European capitalist countries, no matter whether they form this or that group, cannot ease, let alone resolve, the many contradictions between them. This complex and acute struggle is just beginning.

    西欧的经济矛盾在发展
    杨湛林
    两个对垒的经济集团
    今年1月1日以西德为首的西欧六国“共同市场”的建立，和7月间以英国为首的西欧七国“小自由贸易区”计划的具体化，使得西欧出现了两个对立的经济贸易堡垒。这种经济贸易战的白热化，使得帝国主义阵营的矛盾更为尖锐起来。
    六国“共同市场”的建立是对英国的严重打击。大家知道，英国是一个在很大程度上依赖于对外贸易的国家。英国的国外市场主要有二，一是英镑区，一是西欧。英国出口商品的二分之一是输往英镑区的，四分之一是输往西欧的，而输往“共同市场”六国的商品又占其输往西欧市场的一半以上。但是战后以来，由于资本主义发展不平衡规律，后来倔起的西德正在资本主义世界各个市场上节节排挤英国的贸易阵地，特别在西欧市场上西德已经击败英国而独占鳌头。而现在西德和法国联合其他四国组织把英国排斥在外的“共同市场”，更使英国在经济和政治上的地位遭到挑战。
    为了反击以西德为首的六国“共同市场”集团，以改变对自己的不利形势，并进而增加同西德争夺西欧领导权的资本，早在去年10月，当英国原来的“自由贸易区”计划谈判有明显破裂的迹象的时候，英国即同非“共同市场”成员国在伦敦举行秘密会议，酝酿另组“小自由贸易区”。“小自由贸易区”将实行英国过去提出过的“自由贸易区”计划的原则。那就是逐步降低成员国工业品的关税，直到完全取消。同时农产品又不包括在内。而在对外关税方面，各国仍然可以自由决定其税率。这样就便于英国的工业品占领这些国家的市场，而同时又不会损害英国同英联邦国家之间的“帝国特惠权”。
    在英国和瑞典的带头下，七国专家终于在6月在斯德哥尔摩举行会议，讨论尽快建立一个“小自由贸易区”的问题，并拟就了计划草案。7月20日到21日，七国在斯德哥尔摩举行部长级会议，讨论这项计划草案，会后发表公报，正式向各自的政府建议成立“欧洲自由贸易联盟”，同时还通过了成立“欧洲自由贸易联盟计划草案”，并决定在这个草案基础上起草一项协定。现有消息，待协定批准后，可望于1960年1月1日生效，并在同年7月1日第一次降低关税20％。至此，在欧洲继欧洲支付同盟垮台之后，西欧各国正式分裂成两个对立的经济集团，资本主义国家的矛盾更进入了一个新的阶段。
    明争暗斗
    但是，英国积极筹组“小自由贸易区”的真正目的，政治大于经济。因为“小自由贸易区”将使西欧长期分裂为“共同市场”和“小自由贸易区”两大集团，这意味着英国从对西欧领导的地位，退居于“小自由贸易区”七国范围内。这当然不是英国所愿意的。英国筹组“小自由贸易区”的真正意图，是对“共同市场”六国施加压力，迫使它们重新考虑英国先前提出的大“自由贸易区”计划。英国报纸毫不隐讳地承认了这一点。英国“经济学家”杂志坦白指出，英国可以通过建立七国“自由贸易区”，使拥有斯堪的纳维亚市场的西德出口商感受到压力，然后它们大概就会进而对法国施加压力，这种压力将迫使“共同市场”接受同英国在欧洲达成比较广泛的协议。
    的确，英国这一手对西德的打击是相当凶的。因为西德和“小自由贸易区”中除英国外的六国的经济关系是十分密切的。西德的对外贸易中，有30％输往“共同市场”各国，而输往“小自由贸易区”七国也达到28％。西德汽车出口对“小自由贸易区”七国的数额为对“共同市场”五国出口的两倍。而目前西德的钢铁、金属制品、机器车辆、化学品等在这些地区内都占相当优势。因此，英国组织“小自由贸易区”将使西德在这地区的利益受到很大的损失。本来，西德对英国的“自由贸易区”计划并不是绝对反对的，它本想凭借它雄厚的经济潜力一面控制西欧“共同市场”各国，同时又通过英国“自由贸易区”计划来打入英国势力范围。而只是由于法国的竭力反对，考虑到巴黎—波恩轴心目前的作用，因此没有同意英国的计划。而现在英国“小自由贸易区”这样一压，西德的态度不能不动摇起来。不久前西德经济部的一项研究材料就警告说：如果不在“共同市场”和“小自由贸易区”之间搭起桥梁，就必然会受到“严重的损失”，特别是西德。
    不仅如此，为了对抗“共同市场”，英国除了筹建“小自由贸易区”之外，还对“共同市场”进行经济渗透。英国公司在法国和意大利建立新基地或扩大现有企业的活动，正在日益加紧。英国“曼彻斯特卫报”曾经说，这是“抗议对六国联盟以外国家排斥之合理回答”。
    当然，“共同市场”国家、特别是西德也不会放松对“小自由贸易区”国家的侵入。今年以来它们也加强了对“小自由贸易区”范围内的投资活动。在参加“小自由贸易区”集团的北欧国家中，丹麦是工业较薄弱的国家，在丹麦投资不仅有利可图，而且可顺利地把产品输往瑞典、挪威。因此西德等六国集团的成员国纷纷向丹麦输出资本。以英国为首的七国集团的国家，为了对抗六国集团的投资，也就加紧了对丹麦的资本输出。据外国报刊载称，今年上半年，流入丹麦的外国资本共达三千三百万丹麦克朗，其中瑞典、挪威、英国等为七百五十万丹麦克朗，西德、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡、瑞士、奥地利等为一千九百万克朗。
    由此可见，随着“小自由贸易区”的建立，两大经济贸易集团之间的争夺战正在越来越激烈。“共同市场”的内部矛盾
    英国所以要借建立“小自由贸易区”，对共同市场施加压力，这是因为英国看准“共同市场”内部矛盾重重，利害冲突尖锐，可以借此瓦解“共同市场”。
    事实上，从今年1月“共同市场”正式开张以来，内部已经吵了几架了。本来“共同市场”条约规定，六国之间要逐步取消进口税，但六国政府为了不让某些商品大量输入，就在它们第一次降低关税和提高进口限额后，增加了这些商品的消费税，从而抵销了降低关税的作用。意大利甚至既不肯按条约规定增加从西德、法国进口汽车的限额，也不愿多进口比利时和西德的煤，以缓和“煤钢联营”集团的煤业危机。而相反的却继续输入英国的汽车和美国的煤。这实际上破坏了“共同市场”的协定。
    大家知道，“共同市场”刚成立时正值“共同市场”六国煤钢生产发生危机的时候。各国煤炭生产过剩，特别是西德、比利时卖不出去的煤堆积如山，大批矿井关闭，工人解雇。当时比利时一直要求“煤钢联营”的“高级机构”宣布煤业处于“危机状态”以便削减煤的生产，使比利时的煤便于销出去。但是，其他国家由于煤业危机情况，并且想摆脱自身的困难，一直不愿宣布煤业处于“危机状态”，逼得比利时嚷着要暂时退出“联营”。在钢的问题上，由于法国利用去年底法郎贬值，大肆向西德等国推销法国钢，西德就毫不客气地通过“煤钢联营”高极机构迫使法国对钢铁征收4％的出口税。法国不满，并拒绝了西德的要求。
    随着“小自由贸易区”的积极筹建，“共同市场”六国的内部矛盾进一步尖锐化了。西德想跟英国暂时调整关系的企图遭到法国的反对。由于法国工业竞争能力比不上英国，例如，法国机器装备的价格平均比西德和英国的价格高15％到20％，船舶高三分之一，法国工业品并不希望到英国传统市场上找出路，以扩大国外市场，而是首先要保持它的国内市场。但法国又是个大农产品输出国，需要扩大它的海外市场；而“自由贸易区”计划只包括工业品不包括农业品，这就使得竞争力强的英国工业品得以自由进入法国市场，而法国的农产品却无法扩大它的海外市场。对法国说来，“自由贸易区”计划只有害处没有好处。因此，法国坚决拒绝同英国进行大“自由贸易区”的谈判。但西德最近却不顾法国反对准备了一个关于建立欧洲“自由贸易区”的新提议，提交给予9月16日在斯特拉斯堡举行的“欧洲理事会”。提议主张“自由贸易区”包括“共同市场”六国、“小自由贸易区”七国和不参加集团的爱尔兰、希腊、土耳其、西班牙等国家。与此同时，西德垄断资本的代理人、“共同市场”执行委员会的主席、西德人哈尔斯坦于9月24日在斯特拉斯堡举行的“共同市场”议会秋季会议上阐述了他的关于发展一个“欧洲经济联合”的计划。
    除西德外，由于荷兰考虑到建立“小自由贸易区”将使荷兰农产品在英国的市场被丹麦抢走，也主张重开大“自由贸易区”的谈判。在斯特拉斯堡会议上，荷兰代表主张两个集团需要联合。他还批评了“共同市场”执行机构在多边联合问题上采取的不明确态度。他说，法国对这个问题的犹豫，不应使其他国家也放弃这一点。
    由此可见，随着“小自由贸易区”的建立，“共同市场”的内部矛盾正在日益发展着。
    同床异梦的七国集团
    “小自由贸易区”内部也是矛盾重重的。经济力量薄弱、地理上分散，是“小自由贸易区”的弱点。“共同市场”有着一亿六千多万人口，它的工业生产在西方国家工业生产中占21.6％，出口占24.1％。而“小自由贸易区”只有八千八百万人口，工业生产只占11.3％，出口只占16.8％。更严重的是，七国经济发展的不平衡性，比六国尤为严重。这就决定了这个七国集团内部关系是不稳固的。
    在筹建过程中，积极支持“小自由贸易区”计划的实际上只有工业比较发达而不怕自由竞争的英国、瑞士、瑞典、挪威等国。丹麦对该计划首先表示怀疑，因为丹麦是一个一向同时对英国和西德出口大量农产品的国家（对英国出口占丹麦出口总额的40％，对西德出口占30％）。同时作为一个主要是农产品输出国的丹麦，它也害怕参加一个工业品的“自由贸易区”将不利于本国的工业，而它的农产品的输出却又得不到好处。
    参加七国集团的所有国家，包括英国在内，同“共同市场”国家之间的贸易量都大于它们彼此之间的贸易量。例如，奥地利的进口和出口有一半是同六国进行的，奥地利卖给六国的商品，四倍于它卖给七国的商品。同样，瑞士卖给六国的商品，三倍于它卖给七国的商品。这就使得这些国家对参加“小自由贸易区”都有不同程度的顾虑。
    英国为了促成“小自由贸易区”的建立，不得不同丹麦进行单边联系，并作了一些让步，同意从1960年7月1日起，在二年内取消丹麦输出到英国的咸肉（占丹麦对英国出口的农产品总值的一半）和奶酪的关税。这就是说，英国以每年牺牲一百万英镑的代价换得了丹麦同意加入七国集团。可是，丹麦农产品的对英国的输出虽然得到了特殊的规定，但它的工业品却招来了剧烈的竞争，有被吞没的危险，这不能不引起丹麦工业界的忧心忡忡。为了减轻外来竞争的袭击，丹麦工业联合会已向它的政府要求把一些主要工业品的关税提高22.5％到25％。丹麦工业界的这一举动，在其他成员国可能会引起连锁性的反应。
    工业比较发达、渔产品在出口中占很大比重的挪威，对于英国只就丹麦农产品出口问题作了特殊处理的安排，而对渔产品却没有作出任何安排，就很不满。挪威工党机关报“工人报”不久前抨击英国在“小自由贸易区”所执行的有关渔产品的政策。该报指出，如果英国不改变这一政策，挪威将在“自由贸易区”的重要部门失利。这正反映出挪威在“小自由贸易区”问题上同英国的矛盾。
    由于内部矛盾的错综复杂，看来，“小自由贸易区”在实施过程中，将遇到重重困难。
    从“共同市场”和“小自由贸易区”斗争中可以看到，西欧资本主义国家无论它们组成这样或那样的集团都不能缓和、更谈不到解决它们之间的重重矛盾。这种复杂而尖锐的斗争，正方兴未艾。
