　　Since 1953, after Xiao Peijun was selected as a model worker in highway transportation in Hunan Province and the whole country, the employees of the highway transportation system have affectionately called him "Model Worker Xiao." The car he drives is also commonly referred to as the "Model Worker Car," and its license plate number has almost been forgotten.

　　The car he drives has traveled 320,500 kilometers since it was overhauled in 1953 without undergoing an intermediate repair. The number of minor repairs is also less than that of other vehicles. The routes it travels include smooth roads and steep mountain slopes. In the long span of six years and two months, it has never broken down or had any accidents, big or small, regardless of sunny, rainy, or snowy weather.

　　However, the "Model Worker Car" used to be a famous "old-timer car." "One to two or three miles, break down four or five times, repair six or seven times, eight, nine, ten people push." This doggerel popular among highway transportation workers before liberation aptly described the dilapidated condition of the "Model Worker Car" in the past. It was a 1942 Japanese Nissan charcoal car, and many of its parts were pieced together from various brands of car parts. According to regulations, it should have been scrapped long ago.

　　The Car's "Nanny"

　　How did the "old-timer car" become the "Model Worker Car"?

　　Anyone who talks to the drivers of Xiao Peijun's motorcade about this issue will answer in unison:

　　"It's because it has a good 'nanny'!"

　　Xiao Peijun's care for the car is meticulous. He would rather endure some hardship himself than let the car suffer any damage. After returning from a trip every day, he would carefully inspect every part of the car. During the journey, when encountering muddy or broken roads or steep and dangerous slopes, he would stop to observe, not allowing the car to be trapped. When waiting to cross by ferry, or when loading, unloading, or waiting to load or unload, he would always walk around the car, patiently tapping and touching it. When driving on new routes, he would ask the drivers who had come before for information. These things may not seem difficult, but to do them consistently requires perseverance and a high sense of responsibility. The charcoal car's gas filter flannel bag needs to be changed and washed frequently, so Xiao Peijun changes and washes it every day, and always pays attention to checking it. Once, during an inspection, he found black soot spots on the seams and patches of the flannel bag, which he found very strange, and immediately investigated the cause. He held the flannel bag up to the sunlight and found that the stitches were too thick and the thread was too thin on the seams and patches, creating small holes. At the corners of the flannel bag, he also found fine sand particles that had been picked up while washing it in the river. He thought: mud, sand, and dust are the machine's greatest enemies. If they get inside the machine, it's like bacteria getting into a person's blood, which is very dangerous. From then on, when changing and washing the flannel bag, he would always wash it back and forth to prevent any sand from sticking to it. When sewing and patching the flannel bag, he would use fine needles and thick thread to eliminate the small holes; he also carried a needle and thread kit with him, so that he could immediately sew up any damage to the flannel bag.

　　Using waste materials and his own hardworking hands, he installed air filters, oil filters, and gas filters on his car, so that the oil, air, and gas entering the engine were spotless. This played a significant role in protecting the parts and extending the life of the car.

　　Xiao Peijun compared the car maintenance factory to a "hospital," the technicians to "doctors," and himself to a "nurse." He believed that the "nurse" should know the "patient" best, so he followed the car into the factory for every maintenance, introduced the situation to the technicians, and personally participated in the vehicle maintenance work. Moreover, he would not leave the factory until the car left. Sometimes, when the workers at the maintenance factory went off work, he would still be there carefully inspecting and repairing, often busy until late at night, forgetting to eat and sleep. He often said: "People have consciousness, and if they get sick, they will find a doctor to treat them. Machines cannot speak, so they rely entirely on people to care for them and protect them, and there cannot be any ambiguity."

　　Local Expert

　　Due to Xiao Peijun's continuous technical innovations, the mechanical equipment on his car has become increasingly perfect, making it very flexible and easy to operate, able to climb mountains and cross ridges, and adapt to various complex environments.

　　Ordinary charcoal cars use hand-cranked blowers to start the furnace, which takes ten minutes to start the furnace every morning. However, he installed an electric blower, which only takes four or five minutes to start the furnace with the electric blower turned on. When trying out the electric blower, he encountered the difficulty of not knowing how to maintain it. It was easy to break, and there was nowhere to repair it. He kept learning technology from fitters and electricians, and finally learned all the maintenance techniques.

　　After his car was equipped with a trailer, it was initially very difficult to climb uphill, and the water in the water tank would boil before reaching the top of the slope. Therefore, he welded three iron plates onto the flywheel, which worked very well. This increased the horsepower of the charcoal car engine. Now the payload of his main vehicle has increased from two and a half tons to three tons, and it has a three-ton trailer. He also designed and modified the water tank himself, imitating the style of the Liberation brand car, changing the crossbeam of the frame, and firmly installing a large water tank on the Nissan car, which was originally impossible to install. After these two improvements, the car no longer felt difficult when climbing uphill, and the water in the water tank no longer boiled.

　　In order to save charcoal, he conducted experiments on using low-grade alcohol as fuel and modifying the white coal stove last year, and both were successful. He used waste materials and a local method to make an evaporator, which solved the problem that low-grade alcohol contains a lot of water, is not easy to atomize, and the car engine cannot be started. The success of this experiment has opened up new avenues for the future use of low-grade liquid fuels in automobiles. When carrying out the innovation of modifying the white coal stove, he went to the maintenance factory early every morning to do this and that, often working day and night, and finally succeeded after a month of hard work. Due to his outstanding achievements in technical innovation, the Ministry of Communications officially awarded him the honorary title of "Local Expert" at the National Highway Scientific Research Work Conference.

　　Abundant Fruits

　　Xiao Peijun's advanced experience in extending the interval mileage between major and intermediate repairs of automobiles has blossomed and borne fruit everywhere.

　　Once, he spent the night at the Liling Railway Station. After drivers from other regions learned that he was Xiao Peijun, they all gathered around to ask him to share his experience. That night, under the light of a kerosene lamp, he talked with his colleagues until nearly twelve o'clock. He answered and explained patiently to whatever people asked. At the same time, in his daily work, he often humbly learned experience from other drivers, even if it was only a little bit, he regarded it as a treasure and remembered it firmly. He often said: "When I was in Beijing for a meeting, the leaders often warned us: Advanced producers must be humble and impart their experience and technology to everyone without reservation. One person's advancement is just a single soldier, but the advancement of everyone can move mountains and overturn seas. If everyone progresses and improves, socialist construction will be faster and better."

　　Now, more than 90% of the old drivers in Hunan Province have basically mastered Xiao Peijun's advanced experience, and the interval mileage between major and intermediate repairs of automobiles has also been extended accordingly. There are already more than 800 cars in the province that have traveled 100,000 kilometers without a major repair.

　　At this National Congress of Heroes, Xiao Peijun solemnly expressed his determination: On the basis of completing the annual task four months ahead of schedule, to exceed the quota by 50,000 ton-kilometers, and to ensure that he will achieve 330,000 kilometers without an intermediate repair by the end of this year.

    萧培俊和“劳模车”
    从1953年开始，萧培俊被选为湖南省和全国的公路运输劳动模范以后，公路运输系统的职工们就开始亲切地爱叫他
  “萧劳模”。他驾驶的汽车，大家也习惯地称为“劳模车”，而它的车号，却几乎被人们遗忘了。
    他驾驶的汽车，从1953年大修出厂以来已经行驶了三十二万零五百公里没有中修过，小修次数也比其他的车辆少。它行驶的线路，有平坦大道，也有高山陡坡，在六年零二个月的漫长岁月里，不管是晴天、雨天或者冰雪天，它从来没抛过锚，没出过任何大小事故。
    可是，“劳模车”在过去，却是一辆有名的“老爷车”。“一去二三里，抛锚四五回，修理六七次，八九十人推。”这首解放以前在公路运输工人当中流行的打油诗，十分恰当地描述了“劳模车”昔日破烂不堪的情景。它是一辆1942年出厂的日本尼桑牌木炭汽车，车子的许多机件是用各种厂牌的汽车零件并凑起来的，按照常规，它早就该报废了。
    汽车的“保姆”
    “老爷车”是怎样变成“劳模车”的呢？
    谁要和萧培俊车队的驾驶员谈到这个问题时，他们都会异口同声地回答：
    “就因为它有个好‘保姆’啊”！
    萧培俊对汽车的爱护是无微不至的。他宁肯自己受点累，也从不叫汽车受一点损伤。他每天出车回来，总要细心地检查车子的各个部件。在行车途中，碰到泥深路烂或坡陡路险时，他就停车察看，不让车子受到陷害。在待渡过船时、在装卸或待装待卸时，总是要绕车转一圈，不厌其烦地东敲敲，西摸摸。在行驶新线路时，他就向前面来的驾驶员问明情况。这些看来并不是什么难事，但要经常做到，就要有毅力，就要有高度的责任感。木炭车的煤气滤清绒布袋需要经常换洗，萧培俊就每天换洗一次，并时时注意检查。有一次检查时，他发现绒布袋上缝边和钉补钉的地方有黑色烟灰点，觉得很奇怪，立即研究原因。他把绒布袋对着阳光一照，原来是缝边和打补钉时针粗线细，所以产生了一个个小孔。在绒布袋折角处，他又发现有在河里洗涤时沾上的细砂粒。他想：泥沙灰尘是机器最大的敌人，它混进机器内部，就像细菌混入了人的血液一样，非常危险。以后，他换洗绒布袋时，总是要翻来复去地洗，不让有泥砂沾上。缝补绒布袋时，他就用细针粗线，消灭了小孔；他还随身带着针线包，发现绒布袋有破损就立即缝补好。
    他利用废料和自己一双辛勤的手，在自己的车子上装上了空气滤清器、机油滤清器和煤气滤清器，使进入引擎的机油、空气和煤气都一尘不染。这对于保护机件、延长车子的使用年限都起了很大的作用。
    萧培俊把汽车保修厂比喻为“医院”，技工是“医生”，他自己是“护士”。他认为“护士”是应该最了解“病员”的，因此他在汽车每次保养时都跟随进厂，向技工介绍情况，并亲手参加车辆保养工作。而且总是车不出厂，人也不出厂。有时，保修厂的工人下班了，他还在那里细心地检修，一直忙到深夜，往往忘记了吃饭，忘记了睡觉。他常说：“人有知觉，得了病自己会找医生医治。机器不能说话，就全靠人来关照它，爱护它，不能有一点含糊。”
    土专家
    由于萧培俊不断进行技术革新，他车上的机件设备已经日趋完善，操作起来很灵便、省力，能够爬山越岭，适应各种复杂的环境。
    一般的木炭车都是用手摇风鼓发动炉子，每天早晨发动炉子要花十分钟时间，他却装上电风鼓，只要把电风鼓一开，四、五分钟就行了。在试用电风鼓时，他遇到不会保养的困难，容易坏，坏了又没处修，他就不断地向钳工、电工们学技术，终于把保养技术都学会了。
    他的汽车在加带拖斗以后，开始时上坡很吃力，没有爬上坡顶，水箱里的水就沸腾了。于是，他在飞轮上加焊了三块铁板，效果很好。这样就增强了木炭车引擎的马力。现在他的主车载重已经由二吨半增加到三吨，并加带了一个三吨的拖车。他又自己动手设计改装水箱，仿照解放牌汽车的式样，改动车架横梁，把一个大水箱牢固地安装在本来无法安装的尼桑牌车上。经过这两项改进以后，汽车上坡时不再感到吃力了，水箱里的水也不再沸腾了。
    为了节约木炭，他在去年进行了用低级酒精作燃料和改装白煤炉的试验，结果都获得了成功。他利用废料，用土办法做成了一个蒸发器，解决了因低级酒精含水分多、不易雾化、汽车引擎无法发动的问题，这项试验的成功，为今后汽车使用低级液体燃料开辟了新的途径。他在进行改装白煤炉的革新时，每天一清早就到保修厂做这做那，经常是夜以继日地干，经过一个月的苦战终于获得成功。由于他在技术革新中成绩显著，交通部在全国公路科学研究工作会议上，正式授予他以“土专家”的光荣称号。
    硕果累累
    萧培俊延长汽车大、中修间隔里程的先进经验，已经到处开花、到处结果了。
    一次，他在醴陵车站过夜，来自其他地区的驾驶员知道他就是萧培俊以后，都围拢来请他介绍经验。这晚，在一盏煤油灯下，他和同行们谈到将近十二点。人家问什么，他都耐心地回答解释。同时，在日常工作中，他常常虚心地向别的驾驶员学习经验，哪怕是一点一滴，他都视为珍宝，牢记不忘。他常常这样说：“我在北京开会时，首长们常这样告诫我们：先进生产者要谦虚，要毫不保留地把自己的经验技术传授给大家。一人先进只是单枪匹马，众人先进才能移山倒海。大家都进步了，提高了，社会主义建设就会更快更好。
    现在，湖南省有90％以上的老司机已经基本上掌握了萧培俊的先进经验，汽车的大、中修间隔里程也相应地延长了。全省十万公里无大修的汽车已经有八百多辆。
    萧培俊这次在全国群英大会，庄严地表示了他的决心：在提前四个月完成全年任务的基础上，超额五万吨公里，并且保证在今年底实现三十三万公里无中修。　（廖道维）
