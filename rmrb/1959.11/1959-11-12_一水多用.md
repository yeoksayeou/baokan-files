    Multiple Use of Water
    Zhang Ke
    The experience of the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County in using indigenous methods to manufacture hydraulic machinery and extensively utilizing water resources is a typical example of implementing the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and fully leveraging the power of small-scale local groups. This experience is currently being widely promoted throughout Gansu Province, and other regions can also draw inspiration from it.
    Utilizing water resources is a task being carried out in various regions. How to utilize them well and how to fully leverage the role of water is a matter worthy of attention. The characteristic of Tianzhu County is that it not only utilizes larger rivers, lakes, and water conservancy projects, but also utilizes small ditches and streams, down to small channels with a flow rate of only 0.15 cubic meters per second; it not only utilizes them for irrigation but also uses them as power. Such extensive utilization allows water to play different roles. Another characteristic of Tianzhu County in utilizing water resources is the use of indigenous methods and the combination of indigenous and foreign techniques. In addition to establishing hydroelectric power stations where conditions permit, they mainly modify and create various indigenous machines using wood, stone, and a small amount of iron. Sometimes, with just a few dozen yuan or even less, they can increase work efficiency several times over.
    Perhaps some people think that the water in those small ditches and channels that can be stepped over is limited, or that indigenous methods don't solve much of a problem. This is a wrong understanding. Although the water energy of a small channel may not be great, the combined water energy of many small channels is quite significant. In Tianzhu County, Gansu Province, which is not abundant in water resources, the full utilization of large and small rivers and channels has resulted in an increase of 460 horsepower throughout the county, saving more than 290,000 labor days and over 400 head of livestock per year. From a national perspective, there are many places with better water resources than Tianzhu County, especially after several years of water conservancy construction, even some formerly arid areas now have a network of channels with flowing water. If all regions can fully utilize these small water energies, the overall energy will be very significant. As for the role of "indigenous" methods, it has become very clear in various production and construction efforts over the past two years. Fertilizers and pesticides produced by indigenous methods have largely solved the difficulties in agricultural production and ensured bumper harvests. Steel and iron smelted by indigenous methods can solve the need for manufacturing simple agricultural machinery and tools. In farmland capital construction and agricultural production, the large-scale use of "indigenous" machines has also greatly improved labor efficiency and reduced labor intensity. The indigenous hydraulic machinery in Tianzhu County fully demonstrates the advantages of low cost, convenient use, and significant benefits, showing the strong vitality of indigenous methods. Of course, establishing hydroelectric power stations with "foreign" machines will have even greater benefits, and it should be vigorously promoted wherever possible. However, this requires spending more money, and the production of generators is difficult to meet demand for the time being, so it is impossible to do this universally in the short term. Only by combining indigenous and foreign methods and integrating large and small scales can the current measures be correct.
    The method of using indigenous machinery to utilize small-scale water resources, due to its small scale, simple methods, local materials, local use, and serving the local area with local resources, is more easily accepted by the masses, facilitating the participation of the broad masses and forming a mass movement. Therefore, it can also fully utilize and tap the wisdom and strength of the masses, and do this matter more, faster, better, and more economically.

    一水多用

    天祝藏族自治县用土办法修制水力机械，广泛利用水力资源的经验，是贯彻土洋并举的方针，充分发挥小土群威力的一个典型范例。这个经验目前正在甘肃全省普遍推广，其他地区也可以从这里得到启发。
    利用水力资源是各地都在进行的工作，如何利用得好，怎样才能充分发挥水的作用，是一个值得注意的问题。天祝县的特点是：不仅利用较大的河湖和水利工程，还利用了小沟小河，直至每秒流量只有零点一五方的小渠道；不仅利用它进行灌溉，还利用它作为动力。这样广泛的利用，使水发挥了不同样的作用。天祝县利用水力资源的另一特点是：土法上马，土洋并举。他们除在有条件的地方建立水电站外，更多的是用一些木头、石头和少量的铁，改制和创造各种土机械。有时只花几十元甚至更少的资金，便能提高工效几倍。
    也许有人认为，那些一步可以跨得过去的小沟小渠的水能有限，或者土办法不解决多大问题。这样认识就错了。一条小渠的水能虽然不大，而许多小渠的水能集中起来就相当大了。水力资源不算丰富的甘肃省天祝县，充分利用大小河渠的结果，全县增加动力四百六十马力，一年可节省二十九万多个劳动日和四百多头牲畜。从全国来看，比天祝县水力资源好的地方多得很，特别是经过几年来的兴修水利运动，原来一些旱田地区也都渠道纵横，流水淙淙了。如果各地对这些细小的水能都能充分运用，能量就很大了。至于“土”办法的作用，近两年来在各项生产建设中已经看得很明显了，土法制造的化肥和农药，在很大程度上解决了农业生产上的困难，保证了农业丰收。土法炼出的钢和铁，可以解决制造农业简易机械和农具的需要。在农田基本建设和农业生产中，由于大量地使用了“土”机器，也大大提高了劳动效率和减轻了劳动强度。天祝县的土制水力机械，更充分显示了成本低廉、使用方便、效益很大的优越性，显示了土办法的强大生命力。当然，用“洋”机器建立水电站的效益会更大些，只要可能就应大力进行。但这要多花些钱，发电机的生产一时也很难满足需要，短时期内不可能普遍这样做。只有土洋并举、大小结合，才是当前的正确措施。
    土制机械利用细小水力资源的办法，由于规模小、方法简便、就地取材就地使用、利用当地资源为当地服务，就更容易为广大群众所接受，便于吸收广大群众参加，形成群众运动。因而也就可以充分发挥和挖掘群众的智慧和力量，把这件事办得更多、更快、更好、更省。
