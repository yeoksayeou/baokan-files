    Seeing "Giselle"
    Jiu Quan
    Ah Lao, Sketch
	Moscow's stage has been moved to Beijing, and we seem to be sitting in the main hall of the Grand Theater. On stage, lovers pour out their heartfelt feelings; on stage and off stage, there is an exchange of brotherly friendship. The ballet "Giselle" is both old and new. Socialist art is the peak of art, and the people's artists are the most glorious artists. The friendship between China and the Soviet Union will last forever! "Giselle" (Note: "Giselle" and "The Wilis" are starred by Soviet People's Artist Struchkova) "The Wilis"
