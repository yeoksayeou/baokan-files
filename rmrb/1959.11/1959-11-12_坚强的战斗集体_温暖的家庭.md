A strong fighting collective, a warm family

The Yishi Juan team of the Shanghai No. 2 State Cotton Factory has maintained the honor of an advanced team for nearly six years. In August of last year, the Party Central Committee issued the call for the Great Leap Forward. All thirty-one members of the Yishi Juan team broke the superstition that the speed of the fine yarn spinning frame could not be increased further. The speed of spinning 21-count weft yarn was continuously increased from 280 revolutions to 400 revolutions, and the output per thousand spindles per hour reached more than 45 kilograms. In August of this year, after the factory Party committee made specific deployments based on the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the Yishi Juan team took the lead again, determined to advance towards higher speeds. After the speed was increased, the first-grade and first-class yarn rate has always maintained an advanced level of 100%.

Breaking Through the High-Speed Barrier

Last year, when the speed began to increase from 280 revolutions to 350 revolutions, the number of broken ends per thousand spindles per hour increased, and the workers could not keep up with the re-joining of the broken ends. As a result, some workers began to doubt the acceleration, and some simply slowed down the machines. Yishi Juan was so anxious that she couldn't sleep at night when she saw that the high-speed barrier had not been broken through. The Party committee instructed: We must "withstand" the broken ends. The core members of the team discussed and decided to take the lead in overcoming the difficulties.

How can we "withstand" the broken ends? Ni Yuzhen had good skills, so Yishi Juan went to Ni Yuzhen's machine aisle, helping her to join the ends while observing her movements, and studying with her how to "withstand" the broken ends. They found that jumping bobbins were the "black sheep." When a bobbin jumped up, the broken end would float and break many other ends. They also found that some broken ends were difficult to join. It took a lot of time, which affected the timely handling of other broken ends, forming a vicious cycle. Therefore, they came up with a solution: when patrolling, they would first deal with the jumping bobbins to avoid affecting other ends. At the same time, they would deal with the easy-to-join broken ends first, and then deal with the difficult-to-join broken ends. In other words, the broken ends must be handled more flexibly. This method was introduced and was very helpful for others to "withstand" the broken ends. Thanks to everyone's fearlessness of difficulties and everyone's brainstorming, the broken ends were "withstood."

Technological Innovation

The broken ends were "withstood," but the production efficiency and unit output were still not high enough. Moreover, it would be difficult to sustain such hard work. The Party branch required everyone to work hard and cleverly, and to innovate operational techniques.

Can female weaving workers engage in technological innovation? A discussion was launched in the team. Some said: Technological innovation is a matter for veteran masters and technicians. We don't even have time to join the ends, so we don't have time or ability to engage in innovation. Yishi Juan suggested that everyone recall the situation after the previous few accelerations. Everyone recalled that when the speed was increased from 170 revolutions to 270 revolutions in the winter of 1954, there were also six or seven hundred broken ends, but later everyone improved their skills and, with the support of maintenance workers, etc., the number of broken ends was reduced to dozens. This shows that everything depends on human effort, and operational techniques can be improved and innovated. As a result, everyone's minds were opened. Some said: Hao Jianxiu can create work methods, why can't we create operational methods suitable for high-speed production? Someone further presented the facts: Ni Yuzhen is also tending high-speed machines, and the number of broken ends is small. Isn't this already a new operational method suitable for high-speed production?

After such a debate, everyone's enthusiasm for technological innovation soared. They all offered ideas and thought of solutions, and shared their experiences of how to adapt to high-speed production. The team organized a technical research group composed of several skilled workers, specializing in the study of operational methods for high-speed production. On the one hand, they collected the team's bits and pieces of experience. At the same time, they sent people to the State Cotton No. 1 Factory and No. 5 Factory to learn the bits and pieces of high-speed operation experience. Combined with their own team's experience, after repeated discussions and experiments, they finally summarized and promoted the high-speed production operation method based on the Hao Jianxiu work method.

With the needs of production development, they continue to improve their technical level. During the Municipal Party Committee's Industrial Conference in February of this year, the Yishi Juan team launched a competition upsurge of "learning from skilled workers and catching up with skilled workers," and comprehensively improved the technical level on the basis of technological innovation last year. At the same time, they further carried out the movement of learning to be all-rounders, with everyone learning to repair minor machine problems and becoming familiar with the performance of the machines. Now, most comrades in the team have basically reached the technical level required in the proposal of the three hundred skilled workers of the city's cotton textile factories; every weaving worker and doffing worker can generally repair some minor machine problems, and gradually grasp the performance of the machines, analyze the causes of broken ends, and more actively grasp the key to production. Due to the general improvement of the technical level of the Yishi Juan team, production efficiency was further improved in the first quarter of this year. At the same speed, the unit output increased from 41 kilograms last year to more than 45 kilograms. Before the National Day, after further increasing the speed, the unit output reached 55 kilograms.

Comprehensive Care for People

It is no accident that the Yishi Juan team has consistently maintained its glorious advanced position. This is the inevitable result of Comrade Yishi Juan's consistent human work and comprehensive care for people under the education of the Party.

Comrade Yishi Juan first cares about everyone's political and ideological improvement. She never discriminates against those who are ideologically backward in the team, but instead shows enthusiasm, care, and patient assistance. Some people have improved their awareness and joined the Party with her patient help. She also cares for the production and life problems in every way. Comrade Yishi Juan has never considered herself very much. She wholeheartedly works for production and for the progress of everyone in the team, truly working selflessly. Comrade Yishi Juan understands in the Party's leadership and her own practice that it is not enough to rely on oneself alone to do human work, but one must rely on everyone. Therefore, she takes the Party group as the core and unites all the team's core members to do human work together. Because the team's core members set an example and care about everyone, they influence, educate, and drive the entire team to care about each other. The most valuable thing about Comrade Yishi Juan is that she never attributes the team's achievements to herself. She always says: "I didn't do anything. It is the Party's education, and it is what everyone did." Precisely because of this, she never separates herself from the masses and stays with the masses. This makes the team truly a strong fighting collective and a warm family.

### 坚强的战斗集体  温暖的家庭

    坚强的战斗集体  温暖的家庭
    上海国棉二厂的裔式娟小组，近六年多来，一直保持着先进小组的荣誉。去年8月，党中央发出大跃进的号召，裔式娟小组全体三十一人，破除了细纱车速不能再加快的迷信，纺二十一支纬纱的车速从二百八十转连续加快到四百转，千锭时单位产量达到四十五公斤以上。今年8月，厂党委根据八中全会作了具体部署以后，裔式娟小组又一马当先，决心向更高的速度进军。在加快了车速以后，而棉纱的一等一级品率，还一直保持在100％的先进水平。
    闯过高速关
    去年，车速开始从二百八十转加快到三百五十转时，千锭时断头增加，工人管接头都来不及。于是，有些工人开始怀疑起加速来了，有的干脆打慢车。裔式娟眼看高速关没有能闯过去，急得晚上睡不着。党委指示：一定要“顶住”断头。小组的骨干一商量，决定带头克服困难。
    怎样才能“顶住”断头呢？倪玉珍的技术好，裔式娟就到倪玉珍的车弄堂里，一面帮助她接头，一面观察她的动作，与她一起研究怎样“顶住”断头。她们发现：跳筒管是“害群之马”，一个筒管跳起来，断头一飘，就打断许多个头。她们还发现：有些断头很难接。费时间多，影响了其他断头不能及时处理，形成恶性循环。于是，她们就想了办法：在巡回时，发现跳筒管，就先行处理，以免影响其他的头，同时，先处理容易接的断头，再处理难接的断头。也就是说，要更加灵活地处理断头。这个办法介绍以后，对其他人“顶住”断头有很大帮助。由于大家不怕困难、大家想办法的结果，断头“顶住”了。
    革新技术
    断头是“顶住”了，但生产效率、单位产量仍然不够高。而且，这样苦战下去，也很难持久。党总支要求大家苦干加巧干，革新操作技术。
    挡车女工能不能闹技术革新？小组里就展开了讨论。有的说：技术革新是保全老师傅、技术人员的事，我们接头也来不及，没有时间，也没有本领去搞革新。裔式娟提议大家回忆过去几次加速后的情况。大家回想到1954年冬天车速从一百七十转加到二百七十转，断头也有六、七百根，后来大家提高了技术，在保全工人等支持下，断头降低到几十根。这说明事在人为，操作技术可以提高，可以革新。这一来，大家思想开了窍。有的说：郝建秀能创造工作法，我们为何不能创造适应高速生产的操作法。有人进一步摆事实：倪玉珍也是挡高速车，断头少，这不是已经有了适应高速生产的新的操作方法吗？
    这样一辩论，大家闹技术革新的积极性就高涨起来，纷纷出主意、想办法，把自己如何适应高速生产的点滴经验都谈了出来。小组里就组织几个技术好的工人成立了一个技术研究组，专门研究高速生产的操作法。她们一方面把小组里的点滴经验集中起来，同时又派人到国棉一厂、五厂去学习高速操作的点滴经验，结合自己小组里的经验，经过反复讨论和试验，终于在郝建秀工作法的基础上，总结推广了高速生产的操作法。
    随着生产发展的需要，她们不断地提高自己的技术水平。今年2月市委工业会议期间，裔式娟小组掀起了“学能手、赶能手”的竞赛热潮，在去年革新技术的基础上，全面提高技术水平。同时，她们进一步开展了学习多面手的运动，人人学会修理机器的小毛病，熟悉掌握机器的性能。现在，小组里大多数同志已经基本上达到了全市棉纺织厂三百能手倡议书中所要求的技术水平；每一个挡车工和落纱工，一般都能修理一些机器的小毛病，并且逐步摸到了机器的性能，分析断头的原因，更主动地掌握生产上的关键。由于裔式娟小组普遍提高了技术水平，今年第一季度，生产效率进一步提高。在同样的车速下，单位产量从去年的四十一公斤提高到四十五公斤以上。国庆节前，进一步提高车速后，单位产量达到五十五公斤。
    全面关心人
    裔式娟小组一贯保持着先进的光荣，不是偶然的。这是裔式娟同志在党的教育下，一贯做人的工作，全面地关心人的必然结果。
    裔式娟同志首先关心大家政治上、思想上的提高。她对于小组里思想上落后的人，从不歧视，而是热情关怀，耐心帮助。有些人在她的耐心帮助下，提高了觉悟，入了党。对于生产上、生活上的问题，也是无微不至地关怀。裔式娟同志从来就很少考虑自己，她一心一意地为生产，为小组里每一个人的进步着想，真正是忘我地工作着。裔式娟同志在党的领导下和自己的实践中懂得，做人的工作，单靠自己是不够的，必须依靠大家。所以，她以党小组为核心，把所有的小组骨干团结起来，共同做人的工作。由于小组的骨干们以身作则，关心大家，从而影响、教育和带动了全组的人彼此互相关心。裔式娟同志最可贵之处，就是从来不把小组的成绩归功于自己，她总是说：“我没有做什么，是党的教导，是大家做的。”正因为如此，她始终不脱离群众，与群众在一起。从而使这个小组真正成为一个既是坚强的战斗集体，又是温暖的家庭。
