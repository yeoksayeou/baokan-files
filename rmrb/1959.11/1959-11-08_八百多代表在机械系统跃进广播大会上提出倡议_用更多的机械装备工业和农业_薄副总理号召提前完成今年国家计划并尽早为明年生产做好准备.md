Xinhua News Agency, 7th. More than eight hundred representatives from the mechanical system attending the National "Heroes Conference," after several days of exchanging experiences, proposed an initiative to mechanical industry workers across the country. They proposed responding to the Party's call, comprehensively and ahead of schedule completing this year's production plan, preparing for the continued Great Leap Forward next year, and supporting the continued Great Leap Forward of various departments of the national economy and the technical transformation of agriculture with more and better mechanical equipment. This initiative was proposed at the National Mechanical System Great Leap Forward Radio Conference held on the 6th.

    Vice Premier of the State Council, Bo Yibo, participated in this radio conference. At the meeting he said that the Party Central Committee called on all the people of our country to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in about ten years. At the same time, we must realize the technical transformation of agriculture in our country as soon as possible. This is the glorious task of the people of our country, especially the working class. In the struggle to realize this task, on the one hand, the mechanical industry is required to provide more and better equipment for the continued Great Leap Forward of industrial sectors such as steel, coal, electricity, chemicals, and petroleum; on the other hand, the technical transformation of agriculture also requires the mechanical industry to produce far more tractors, harvesters, irrigation and drainage machinery, transportation machinery such as automobiles, power machinery, fertilizer equipment, power station equipment, and various farm tools and implements than before. Bo Yibo said that in order to complete this task, the urgent task of the vast number of mechanical industry workers is to complete this year's national plan ahead of schedule and comprehensively, and not to allow contracts due for delivery to carry over into the new year; and to prepare earlier and better for the continued Great Leap Forward next year. In addition, it is necessary to properly arrange the production of mechanical products required for agriculture this winter and next spring, especially the production of products needed to cooperate with the large-scale water conservancy construction movement this winter and next spring, so as to create favorable conditions for the continued Great Leap Forward of agriculture next year.

    The more than eight hundred representatives attending the National "Heroes Conference" were greatly encouraged, and gained many "experiences" in the experience exchange meeting in the past few days, and thus felt that they had increased new strength and were full of energy. At the radio conference, they proposed a continued Great Leap Forward initiative to the workers of the national mechanical system. They demanded that: in the casting and forging sector, the supply of raw materials for manufacturing machinery should be guaranteed in terms of quantity, quality, variety, and schedule, and strive to reach the national inter-factory competition target for high yield and high quality casting and forging; units that have reached this target should strive to increase it by another 20% in 1960. In the riveting and welding sector, efforts should be made to find new process methods to improve the labor productivity of metal structure manufacturing and welding work. In the machining sector, a high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency competition should be widely carried out; factories with conditions should actively organize automatic production lines. In the capital construction sector, we must seize the time to launch shock attacks on this year's key projects, finishing projects, and projects that will provide production capacity for the next two years, especially strengthening the weak links of the mechanical industry and the projects for producing supporting products, and ensuring the quality of the projects. In the auxiliary departments, we must actively cooperate with the production departments to ensure that the requirements of production are met. In scientific research, design, and technology departments, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command, thoroughly carry out ideological transformation, vigorously improve product design, and march towards the world's advanced cutting-edge technology products. In terms of enterprise leadership, we must resolutely implement the policy of combining centralized leadership with large-scale mass movements, and adhere to the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee and the system of workers' representative conferences under the leadership of the Party committee.

    In the days before this radio conference, more than eight hundred representatives also listened to reports from Zhao Erlu, Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, and Chen Zhengran, Minister of the Ministry of Agricultural Machinery, on further developing the campaign to increase production and practice economy and the support of the mechanical industry for agricultural technical transformation; and successively watched technical performances by some representatives and members of the Czechoslovak production innovator delegation who were on a friendly visit to our country. The more than eight hundred representatives also exchanged many systematic and important experiences in launching large-scale mass movements, launching large-scale technological innovations, and improving production management in eight groups according to different types of work and jobs, and exchanged many extremely important experiences in improving operating techniques and tools and equipment in casting, forging and welding, turning, milling and planing, fitter and grinding, electrical engineering, agricultural machinery repair and assembly, etc. The representatives from various places presented their own "treasures" in the exchange, and also learned more "experiences" from the exchange. These "experiences" will play a great role in improving the production of their own units and solving the production key problems of their own units in the future. For example, Wang Bingxiang, a lathe operator from the Shanghai Xingzhong Motor Factory, introduced the thread rolling machine he created, which increased the efficiency of screw processing by hundreds of times. This experience aroused the interest of many representatives from Jiangxi, Hubei, Fujian, Liaoning and other places. Some of the factories where they were located were facing the difficulty that screw production could not keep up with the needs, and some were also creating equipment similar to Wang Bingxiang's. After listening to Wang Bingxiang's introduction, they felt that it was very enlightening and helpful to them. For example, Xu Zongsheng, a forging worker from the Yidu Administrative Office Farm Tool Factory in Hubei, also aroused great interest among the representatives of agricultural machinery repair and assembly factories in various places when he introduced at the exchange meeting the experience of directly refining wrought iron into steel. Xu Zongsheng created a furnace that can directly refine broken farm tools and other scrap wrought iron scattered in rural areas into low-carbon steel, medium-carbon steel, and high-carbon steel, which can be used to cast and forge farm tool accessories and small farm tools, which is exactly the problem that farm tool factories in various places urgently need to solve. The representatives from various places all expressed that they would take the experience learned at this exchange meeting back and promote it well.

    During the past few days of the meeting, many representatives put forward the slogan of continuous Great Leap Forward of "Going Red to the End This Year, Opening Red Next Year," and put forward their action plans for the future, expressing that after returning, they would unite with the workers of their units to strive to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it, and prepare for the continued Great Leap Forward in production in the first quarter of next year. Yao Changyou of Luoyang No. 1 Tractor Factory, on behalf of all the workers of the factory, promised: strive to overfulfill this year's production tasks of tractors and other products; ensure that the average daily output in the first quarter of next year will exceed the average daily output in the fourth quarter of this year, and produce more and better "Dongfanghong" brand tractors. Wei Gaohou, a famous innovation expert from Chongqing Changan Machinery Factory, said in his speech that he guaranteed to solve thirty technical problems in production in the next forty days or so. Wang Liangui, the representative of the famous Ma Hengchang Group of Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Factory, said in his speech that they would learn the advanced experience of hydraulic profiling cutting on the bed in November and increase the efficiency of manufacturing spindles tenfold. Li Fuxiang, a famous innovation expert from Shanghai Boiler Factory, expressed that he would innovate his work of machining boring holes from the current rapid cutting to high-speed cutting, strong cutting, and multi-tool and multi-piece processing.

    At the radio conference on the 6th, Zhao Erlu, Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, and Chen Zhengran, Minister of the Ministry of Agricultural Machinery, both spoke. They said that the more than eight hundred representatives attending the National "Heroes Conference" were the standard-bearers of the mechanical system in implementing the Party's general line and the models for realizing the Great Leap Forward. They encouraged the representatives to maintain the honor given by the Party and the people after returning, and act as the standard-bearers and models in the continued Great Leap Forward. They asked the workers of the national mechanical industry to earnestly learn from them, catch up with them, and promote their experiences, and strive for the better and more comprehensive and sustained Great Leap Forward of the mechanical industry.

    八百多代表在机械系统跃进广播大会上提出倡议
    用更多的机械装备工业和农业
    薄副总理号召提前完成今年国家计划并尽早为明年生产做好准备
    新华社7日讯　出席全国“群英会”的机械系统的八百多名代表，经过几天的交流经验以后，向全国机械工业职工提出了倡议。他们提出响应党的号召，全面、提前完成今年的生产计划，为明年继续跃进作好准备，以更多更好的机械设备支援国民经济各部门的继续跃进和农业的技术改造。这个倡议是在6日举行的全国机械系统跃进广播大会上提出的。
    国务院副总理薄一波参加了这次广播大会。他在这个会上说，党中央号召我们全国人民要在十年左右的时间内在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国。与此同时，要尽快地实现我国的农业技术改造。这是我国人民特别是工人阶级的光荣任务。在为实现这个任务的斗争中，一方面要求机械工业要为钢铁、煤炭、电力、化学、石油等工业部门的继续跃进，提供更多更好的设备；另一方面，农业技术改造也要求机械工业生产出比以前多得多的拖拉机、收割机、排灌机械、汽车等运输机械、动力机械、化肥设备、电站设备、各式农具和工具等等。薄一波说，为了完成这一任务，机械工业广大职工当前的迫切任务是提前和超额全面地完成今年的国家计划，不让应交货的合同过年；更早更好地为明年继续跃进做好准备。此外，要妥善安排今冬明春农业所需要的机械产品的生产，特别是配合今冬明春大规模的水利建设运动所需要的产品的生产，为明年农业的继续跃进创造良好的条件。
    八百多名代表参加全国“群英会”受到了莫大的鼓舞，并在几天来的经验交流会中取得了许多“经”，因而都感到增加了新的力量，全身是劲。他们在广播大会上向全国机械系统的职工提出了继续跃进的倡议。他们要求：在铸锻部门，保证按量、按质、按品种、按期供应制造机械用的毛胚，力争达到全国铸锻高产优质厂际竞赛指标；已经达到这一指标的单位，1960年要争取再提高20％。在铆焊部门，要努力寻求新的工艺方法，提高金属结构制造和焊接工作的劳动生产率。在机械加工部门，要广泛开展高产、高质、高效率竞赛；在有条件的工厂，要积极组织自动生产线。在基本建设部门，要抓紧突击今年的重点工程、收尾工程、为今明两年提供生产能力的工程，特别是加强机械工业薄弱环节与生产配套产品的工程，并且保证工程质量。在辅助部门，要和生产部门主动协作，保证满足生产方面的要求。在科学研究、设计和工艺等技术部门，要坚持政治挂帅，彻底进行思想改造，大力改进产品设计，向世界先进的尖端技术产品进军。在企业的领导方面，要坚决贯彻集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方针，坚持执行党委领导下的厂长负责制和党委领导下的职工代表大会制。
    在这次广播大会以前的几天，八百多名代表还听取了第一机械工业部部长赵尔陆和农业机械部部长陈正人关于进一步开展增产节约运动和机械工业支援农业技术改造的报告；先后观看了一部分代表和正在我国作友好访问的捷克斯洛伐克生产革新者代表团成员所作的技术表演。八百多名代表又按不同的工种和工作，分八个组交流了大搞群众运动、大搞技术革新、改进生产管理等方面许多系统的重要的经验，交流了在铸造、锻焊、车工、铣刨、钳磨、电工、农业机械修配等方面许多改进操作技术和工具设备极为重要的经验。各地的代表在交流中献出了自己的“宝”，同时也从交流中学到了更多的“经”，这些“经”对今后提高本单位的生产、解决本单位的生产关键将起很大的作用。譬如，上海兴中电机厂车工王秉祥介绍了他创造的滚丝机，使加工螺丝的效率提高了好几百倍。这项经验引起了江西、湖北、福建、辽宁等地不少代表的兴趣。他们所在的工厂有的正碰着螺丝生产跟不上需要的困难，有的也正在创造类似王秉祥的设备。他们听了王秉祥的介绍以后，感到对自己启发和帮助很大。又如，湖北宜都行署农具厂锻工徐宗盛，在交流会上介绍的把熟铁直接炼成钢的经验，也引起了各地农业机械修配厂的代表们极大的兴趣。徐宗盛创造了一种炉子，可以把散失在农村的破碎农具和其他废旧熟铁，直接炼成低炭钢、中炭钢和高炭钢，用来浇铸和锻打成农具配件和小农具，这正是当前各地农具厂急待解决的问题。各地代表都表示要把在这次交流会中学到的经验，回去很好地加以推广。
    在这几天的会议中，很多代表都提出了“今年红到底，明年开门红”的不断跃进的口号，纷纷提出了今后的行动计划，表示回去以后要和本单位的职工团结一起，争取提前和超额完成今年的生产计划，作好明年第一季度生产继续跃进的准备工作。洛阳第一拖拉机厂姚长有，代表全厂职工提出保证：争取超额完成今年拖拉机和其它产品的生产任务；保证明年第一季度的平均日产量超过今年第四季度的平均日产量，生产更多更好的“东方红”牌拖拉机。重庆长安机器厂著名的革新能手魏高厚在发言中说，他保证今后四十多天内，解决三十个生产中的技术问题。著名的齐齐哈尔第二机床厂马恒昌小组的代表王连贵在发言中说，他们要在11月份学会在床液压仿型切削的先进经验，把制造主轴的效率提高十倍。上海锅炉厂著名的革新能手李福祥，表示要把他加工搪孔的工作，从现在的快速切削，革新为高速切削、强力切削和多刀、多件加工。
    在6日的广播大会上，第一机械工业部部长赵尔陆和农业机械部部长陈正人都讲了话。他们说，出席全国“群英会”的八百多名代表，是机械系统中贯彻党的总路线的旗手，实现大跃进的标兵。他们勉励代表们回去后，保持党和人民给予的荣誉，充当继续跃进中的旗手和标兵。他们要求全国机械工业职工认真地学习他们、赶上他们，推广他们的经验，为机械工业的更好更全面的持续跃进而奋斗。
