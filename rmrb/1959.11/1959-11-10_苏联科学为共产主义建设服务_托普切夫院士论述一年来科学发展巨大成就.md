Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th: TASS reported from Moscow on the 8th that Academician Topchiev, Vice-President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, published an article in "Pravda" today, summarizing the achievements of Soviet science in the past year.

The article stated that Soviet scientific and technological workers greeted the forty-second anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution with the following achievements: the maiden voyage of the world's first atomic icebreaker, the construction of some new giant power stations, the first artificial solar satellite, the first artificial object to fly to the moon, the first batch of photographs of the far side of the moon, and the discovery of some places on the far side of the moon.

Topchiev pointed out that the three cosmic rockets and the first batch of photographs of the far side of the moon were achievements of world historical significance. Launching automatic interplanetary stations to the moon and photographing the far side of the moon is a feat comparable to those major scientific discoveries known throughout the world. As a result of the study of cosmic space by Soviet artificial satellites and cosmic rockets, radiation belts in the outer space of the earth were discovered. As early as November 1957, the first intelligence about the existence of such radiation belts was obtained through the Soviet's second artificial earth satellite.

Topchiev pointed out that these cosmic messengers of the Soviet people concentratedly embodied all the achievements of mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, radio technology, telemetry, and metallurgy, all the achievements of science, all the strength of our industry, the creative genius of the Soviet people, and the organizational capabilities of our country.

The article then said that in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, the process of scientific research and development proved that Soviet scientists had actively devoted themselves to the work of completing the magnificent program of communist construction stipulated by the 21st Congress of the CPSU. Soviet scientists have achieved new and significant achievements in solving extremely important tasks in astronomy, mathematics, physics, chemistry, geophysics, machine manufacturing, metallurgy, and other scientific departments. Many of these achievements play a significant role in the country's technological progress and in the establishment of the material and technical foundation of communism.

The article mentioned improved automated devices, electronic computers, ultrasonic welding, electrospark machining of metals, and many new artificial materials with specific properties, etc.

Topchiev pointed out that in the past year, Soviet scientists have made great progress in the research and manufacture of plastics, synthetic fibers, and other synthetic materials. A new method was used to obtain a fiber that surpasses Kapron and Nylon in many properties; cheap synthetic material—polypropylene—was obtained from cracked gas, which is suitable for manufacturing fabrics and technical parts. Formaldehyde obtained from natural gas by new methods can reduce the cost of phenolic aldehyde resins and plastics. Topchiev went on to write that Soviet scientists have manufactured some equipment that can be used to automatically find and maintain the most favorable operating procedures for the production of chemical, metallurgical and other industrial departments. The best manipulation system is adopted. The use of flying shears for rolling steel on a continuously running hot rolling mill with an annual output of one million tons of rolled steel can reduce metal waste by 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year.

Topchiev pointed out that the new system of full automation and remote control, which is only adopted in newly put into production oil wells, can save about 2.5 billion rubles in seven years. In terms of metallurgy, some new ways have been studied—manufacturing a rolling device to manufacture non-ferrous metal parts of a predetermined type, and designing new technological regulations for manufacturing metal products directly from molten metal.

Topchiev finally pointed out that many methods and instruments that have been researched, as well as the adoption of semiconductors, electrolytes and phosphors, etc., provide new and huge potential for the development of the national economy.

    苏联科学为共产主义建设服务
    托普切夫院士论述一年来科学发展巨大成就
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科8日讯：苏联科学院副院长托普切夫院士今天在“真理报”发表文章，综述一年来苏联科学的成就。
    文章说，苏联科学技术工作者以下面这样一些成就迎接了伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年：世界上第一艘原子破冰船的开航、一些新的巨型发电站的建设、第一个人造太阳卫星、第一个人造物体的飞上月球、第一批月球背面的照片、月球背面的一些地方的发现。
    托普切夫指出，三个宇宙火箭和第一批月球背面的照片是具有世界历史意义的成就。向月球发射自动行星际站并拍摄到月球背面照片，这个功绩足以同举世闻名的那些重大科学发现并驾齐驱。由于在苏联人造卫星和宇宙火箭进行宇宙空间研究的结果，发现了地球外层空间辐射带。早在1957年11月就通过苏联第二个人造地球卫星获得了关于这种辐射带存在的第一批情报。
    托普切夫指出，苏联人民的这些宇宙使者，集中地体现了数学、物理学、化学、天文学、无线电技术、遥控技术和冶金学的全部成果、科学的一切成就、我们工业的全部实力、苏联人的创造天才、我们国家的组织能力。
    文章接着说，七年计划第一年中，科学研究发展的过程证明，苏联科学家已经积极投入了为完成苏共第二十一次代表大会规定的宏伟的共产主义建设纲领的工作。苏联科学家在解决天文学、数学、物理学、化学、地球物理学、机器制造学、冶金学以及其它科学部门的极重要的任务方面获得了新的重大成就。其中许多成就在国家的技术进步方面，在建立共产主义的物质技术基础方面起着重大的作用。
    文章谈到了经过改进的自动化装置，电子计算机、超声波焊接、金属的电火花加工、许多具有特定性能的人造新材料等。
    托普切夫指出，过去一年中，苏联科学家在研究制造塑料，合成纤维和其它合成材料方面有了很大的进展。用一种新方法获得了一种在许多性能上超过卡玻隆和尼隆的纤维；从热裂气体中获得了廉价的合成材料——聚丙烯，这种材料适合于制造织物和技术零件。用新方法从天然气中获得的甲醛可以降低酚甲醛树脂和塑料的成本。托普切夫接着写道，苏联科学家制造了一些设备可以用来自动地为化学、冶金和其它工业部门的生产寻找和保持最有利的工作程序。采用最好的一种操纵系统。在一台年产一百万吨轧材的连续运转的热轧机上采用轧钢飞剪，每年可以减少金属废料一万到两万吨。
    托普切夫指出，仅在新投入生产的油井中，采用全盘自动化和遥控的新系统，在七年中就可以节省约二十五亿卢布。冶金学方面已经研究出来了一些新的途径——制造一种压延装置来制造预定类型的有色金属零件，以及设计直接从融化的金属中制造金属品的新工艺规程。
    托普切夫最后指出，已研究出来的许多方法和仪器，以及半导体、电解体和萤光质等的采用，为国民经济发展提供了新的巨大的潜力。
