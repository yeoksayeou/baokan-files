According to the Fujian Daily, the Yuxi Commune in Fuqing County is raising a large number of sows, which has led to the rapid development of pigs, eliminated the spread of external diseases, reduced costs, and increased the income of commune members. Since its establishment, the commune's pig farm has bred more than 7,200 piglets. In addition to meeting its own needs, it has also supported other communes and counties with more than 1,000 piglets.

In the past, the Yuxi Commune mostly purchased piglets from other places, which not only increased travel expenses and labor costs, but also easily introduced diseases from outside. Piglets were weak due to long journeys, which easily caused death. Sometimes it was not easy to buy them, which affected the development of pigs. In 1956, the original Yuxi Agricultural Cooperative started from scratch and established a pig farm. After communization, this pig farm has grown stronger. Because the pig farm provides a steady supply of piglets, the commune's annual increase in pigs is 25% (compared to only 10% in the past), making it the commune with the most pigs in the county.

The pig farm uses the method of self-breeding and self-raising, keeping all mothers, and selecting the best to retain sows. All sows, after reaching maturity, must be mated and give birth to a litter of piglets. Then, the number and strength of the piglets are observed to decide whether to keep the sow. Sows that do not meet the standards are sold as meat pigs, while those that are qualified are kept to breed piglets. The boars used for mating are also the best selected breeding boars, so their offspring grow quickly, strongly, and have a high survival rate.

Xinhua News Agency: The Pingtou People's Commune Livestock Farm in Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, has created a new record of high yield with one sow producing 30 piglets in one litter.

The Pingtou People's Commune Livestock Farm selected eight sows in March this year with strong physique, good nutrition, high milk yield and quality, gentle temperament, and high conception rate to establish a "Leap Forward Experimental Field" for producing more piglets. New mating methods such as multiple mating, re-mating, and double-breed mating were adopted to improve the conception rate of sows. On the first day of estrus, they first check whether the estrus is normal; on the second day, they use two different boars for two matings; on the third day, they mate three times continuously, each time with an interval of five hours, for a total of five matings. During each mating, special attention is paid to the climate being warm, the sows and boars being healthy and energetic, and not feeding them during mating to avoid too many people startling the boars, in order to ensure a high conception rate.

After the sow is conceived, for the first fifty days, it is fed twice a day, and the concentrated feed is increased from the original eight taels to twelve taels to promote the development of the fetus. After fifty days, it is fed three times a day, and the concentrated feed is reduced to ten taels a day to prevent the sow from becoming too fat and causing dystocia. After the sow gives birth, it is fed five times a day, and the concentrated feed is increased to one jin to ensure that the sow has sufficient milk. After the sow is pregnant and before giving birth, careful management must be strengthened to prevent abortion caused by crowding. After giving birth, in the case of many piglets and few teats, in addition to making the sow's sixteen teats provide milk for sixteen piglets, the remaining fourteen piglets are allowed to be nursed by other sows, and they are also fed three meals of rice soup a day to ensure that the mothers are strong and the offspring are fat.

### 渔溪公社自繁自养猪源充足  平头公社实行母猪复配一窝产仔30头

    渔溪公社自繁自养猪源充足
    平头公社实行母猪复配一窝产仔30头
    据福建日报报道　福清县渔溪公社大养母猪，使猪只得到迅速发展，杜绝了外来疫病的传染，降低了成本，增加了社员收入。公社养猪场建场以来，已自繁小猪七千二百多头，除满足本社饲养外，还支援外社、外县一千多头小猪。
    渔溪公社过去多向外地购买小猪，不但增加了旅费、劳力等支出，而且外来猪只容易引进疫病；小猪经过长途跋涉，体质瘦弱，容易造成死亡；有时不易买到，影响了猪的发展。1956年，原渔溪农业社白手起家，建立了一个养猪场。公社化后，这个养猪场日益壮大。由于养猪场源源供应小猪，全社一年增加生猪25％（过去只增加10％），成为全县养猪最多的公社。
    这个养猪场饲养母猪采用了自繁自育、见母必留、先留后选的办法。所有母猪成龄后，都要配种生下一胎小猪，然后看生育小猪头数、壮弱，决定选留，不合规格的母猪就作为菜猪出售，合格的就留下繁殖小猪。配种的公猪也都是挑选最好的良种公猪，因此，它的后代长得快长得壮，成活率高。
    本报讯　山西陵川县平头人民公社畜牧场，创造了一头母猪一窝产仔猪三十头的高产新纪录。
    平头人民公社畜牧场在今年3月间，挑选了体格壮、营养好、奶多质高、性情温和、受胎率高的八头母猪，建立了多产仔猪的“跃进试验田”。采用了多配、复配、双种配的新配种方法，提高母猪的受胎率。他们在母猪发情的第一天，先审查发情是否正常；第二天用不同的两头种猪进行两次配种；第三天连续配三次，每次间隔五小时，前后配种五次。在每次配种时，特别注意气候要温暖；母猪、种猪身体无病，精神活泼；配种时不让吃食，避免人多惊乱种猪，以保证提高受胎率。
    母猪受胎以后，前五十天，每天喂两顿，精饲料由原来的八两增加到十二两，促使胎儿的发育。五十天以后，每天喂三顿，精饲料每天减到十两，防止母猪过肥，形成难产。母猪产仔后，每天喂五顿，精饲料增加到一斤，保证母猪奶汁充足。在母猪怀胎以后、分娩以前，要精心地加强管理，防止因拥挤造成流产现象的发生。分娩以后，在产仔多、奶头少的情况下，除使母猪的十六个奶头分奶十六头仔猪外，把剩余的十四头仔猪让别的母猪代奶，每天另喂三顿米汤，保证了母壮儿肥。
