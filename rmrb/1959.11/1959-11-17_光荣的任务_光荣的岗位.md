Supporting Agricultural Technical Transformation
In China, a country with a large population and vast territory and abundant resources, agriculture is the foundation of the national economic development. We must combine the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture, and implement the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously. Accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture is of paramount importance for accelerating the speed of socialist construction. This requires industry to arm agriculture with strong modern technology. This is also the glorious task of the Chinese people, especially the working class.
——Excerpt from the congratulatory message delivered by Comrade Zhu De on behalf of the CPC Central Committee to the "National Congress of Heroes."

    Glorious Task, Glorious Post
    Sun Yiming, Secretary of the Tianjin Tractor Manufacturing Plant Committee of the Communist Party of China
    The Tianjin Tractor Manufacturing Plant was originally an automobile repair shop. It began producing agricultural machinery in 1957. In 1958, it successfully trial-produced the "Iron Ox" brand universal tractor with 40 horsepower. In the past two years, we have produced more than 30,000 units of irrigation and drainage machinery with 4.5 horsepower, 6 horsepower, and 10 horsepower. We started producing tractors in January this year, and by October 24, we had completed the state plan for producing 400 units for the whole year, 68 days ahead of schedule. Within this year, we can increase production by another 200 tractors to support agricultural production.

    Investigating Rural Needs
    In order to accomplish the glorious task of supporting agriculture well, we sent a group of technical cadres to more than a dozen provinces for investigation and research in April 1957. Based on the needs of agricultural production and China's current economic conditions, it was decided to produce 4.5 horsepower, 6 horsepower, and 10 horsepower gas engines, and 40 horsepower universal tractors. These agricultural machines were distributed to 22 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, including Beijing, Hebei, Shandong, Jilin, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Henan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Ningxia, Hunan, and Sichuan, and were welcomed by the majority of farmers.

    To meet the needs of repair and replacement in various places, we also produce a certain number of spare parts every month.

    Passing on Usage and Repair Technology
    In order to enable agricultural machinery to play its role quickly after arriving in the countryside, we have frequently sent a large number of engineers, technicians, and skilled workers to help local areas run training courses to train drivers and teachers for more than two years. We have successively helped Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Beijing and other provinces and cities to train nearly 30,000 technicians, who have basically mastered the use and repair technology of machines. Our factory has also established an agricultural machinery service station, specializing in repairing machines produced by our factory for the countryside and passing on technology. Since 1957, this service station has visited, inspected, and imparted technology in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other places, enabling more than 300 completely defunct machines to regain their vitality. Local Party organizations and the masses of farmers attach great importance to and support our work. A technician was honorably admitted to the Party in Anhui Province because of his good service attitude and great work achievements.

    Summarizing and Disseminating Experience
    In order to help personnel using agricultural machines in various places systematically and continuously improve their technical level and solve the difficult problems in the process of using machines, we have compiled and printed a publication called "Technical Communication," which specializes in summarizing the experience of using machines and answering technical questions raised by users. In addition, we have also compiled and printed books and materials such as "Fifty Kinds of Parts Manual" and "Gas Engine Operation and Management Technology" for reference by relevant units.

    Recently, Comrade Zhu De, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, put forward the task of realizing agricultural technical transformation as soon as possible at the National Congress of Heroes. In this great and glorious cause, we must continue to hold high the red flag of the general line, vigorously carry out mass movements, ensure the completion of plans on a daily and decadal basis, further improve the above-mentioned tasks, and at the same time complete the expansion project on schedule, with quality and quantity, so as to produce more tractors for the people's communes.

    支持农业技术改造
    在我们中国这样一个人口众多、地大物博的国度里，农业是国民经济发展的基础。我们必须把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业结合起来，贯彻执行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针。尽快地实现农业技术改造，对于加快社会主义建设的速度有着头等重要的意义。这就要求工业以强大的现代技术武装农业。这也是我国人民特别是工人阶级的光荣的任务。
    ——摘自朱德同志代表中共中央向“群英会”所致祝词
    光荣的任务  光荣的岗位
    中共天津拖拉机制造厂委员会书记　孙一明
    天津拖拉机制造厂原来是个汽车修配厂，从1957年开始生产农业机械。1958年试制成了四十马力的铁牛牌万能拖拉机。两年多来，我们一共生产了四个半马力、六个马力、十个马力的排灌机械三万多台；从今年1月开始生产拖拉机，到10月24日便提前六十八天完成了全年生产四百台的国家计划。今年以内，还可以增产二百台拖拉机，支援农业生产。
    调查农村需要
    为了很好地完成支援农业的光荣任务，我们曾在1957年4月派出一批技术干部到十几个省份进行了调查研究。根据农业生产的需要和我国当前的经济条件，确定生产四个半马力、六个马力和十个马力的煤气机，四十个马力的万能拖拉机。这些农业机械分送到北京、河北、山东、吉林、江苏、广东、河南、贵州、云南、宁夏、湖南、四川等二十二个省、市、自治区，受到了广大农民的欢迎。
    为供应各地修配的需要，我们每月还生产一定数量的修配件。
    传授使用和修理技术
    我们为了让农业机械下乡以后，能够迅速发挥作用，两年多来，经常派出大批工程师、技术员和技术工人帮助地方开办训练班，训练司机手和师资。我们已经先后帮助河北、河南、山东、山西、江苏、安徽和北京等省、市培养了近三万名技术人员，他们都基本上掌握了机器的使用和修理技术。我厂还建立了一个农业机械服务站，专门为农村修理我厂出产的机器，并且传授技术。1957年以来，这个服务站已到河南、河北、山东、山西、安徽、江苏等地进行了访问、检修和传授技术的工作，使三百多台完全丧失作用的机器恢复了青春。各地党组织和农民群众非常重视和支持我们的工作。一个技术员因为服务态度好，工作成绩大，还在安徽省光荣地入了党。
    总结和传播经验
    为了帮助各地使用农业机器的人员系统地不断地提高技术水平，解决他们使用机器过程中的疑难问题，我们编印了一个名叫“技术通讯”的刊物，专门总结机器使用的经验，解答用户提出的技术问题。另外还编印了“五十种零件手册”和“煤气机操作管理技术”等书籍资料，供有关单位参考。
    最近，朱德同志代表党中央在全国群英大会上提出了尽快地实现农业技术改造的任务。在这一伟大光荣的事业中，我们一定要继续高举总路线的红旗，大搞群众运动，保证按日按旬地完成计划，进一步作好上述各项工作，同时要按期按质按量地完成扩建工程，以便为人民公社生产更多的拖拉机。
