    Suggestions Regarding Citing the Works of Classic Writers
    The articles "How Should Marxists Treat Revolutionary Mass Movements" published in the People's Daily on August 30th and Sun Dingguo's "We Must Correctly Treat Revolutionary Mass Movements" on September 1st both quoted a passage from Lenin's evaluation of the Paris Commune by Marx, but the translations are not entirely the same. There are also similar situations in several other quotations. It is common to see different translations of the same work by classic writers in other articles and publications. Some translators, when encountering famous quotes from classic writers, sometimes avoid consulting existing Chinese translations to avoid the trouble of looking them up. This causes inconvenience to readers and creates confusion in citations. I would like to make a suggestion to authors and translators: when quoting the words of classic writers, please try to use existing Chinese translations, and use the latest version.

    Inappropriate Terminology
    In the news item "Booming Sales in Urban and Rural Areas" on the front page of November 3rd, it was mentioned that "with the further development of the increase production and practice economy movement... the purchasing power of government institutions has significantly decreased." A decline in purchasing power is a phenomenon of capitalist society caused by stagnation or decline in production, increased unemployment, and rising prices. This phenomenon will not occur in socialist countries. On the contrary, with the rapid development of socialist construction, production is constantly expanding, and social purchasing power is constantly growing. Recently, due to the implementation of economy in all aspects and the spirit of diligence and thrift in all undertakings, government institutions and organizations have reduced their regular expenses, and purchased fewer things from the market than before. This is a very good phenomenon and cannot be described as a decline in purchasing power.

    Hoping for Regular Publication of Letters to the Editor in Each Section
    The People's Daily often has columns such as "Viewers' Words," "Readers' Comments on Books," "From Among the Readers," and "Everyone Discusses" on page eight, reflecting readers' opinions and requirements, which I find very good. Page seven also pays attention to publishing readers' letters, such as the "Thank You to Excellent Films for Educating Us" special page on November 15th, which is very attractive. However, in recent times, other pages have rarely published readers' letters, and we cannot hear voices directly from the readers. I hope that all sections can publish letters to the editor regularly, rather than sporadically.

    Recently, the People's Daily has published fewer letters to the editor. I think that the letters to the editor column has a broad mass character, which can strengthen the ties between the Party and the broad masses of people, and can also inspire the broad masses of readers to care about the Party and the people's newspaper propaganda work, and learn from it. I hope to see this column frequently in the newspaper.

    Editor's Note: The readers' opinions are very good. Our newspaper will pay attention to publishing more letters to the editor in all sections in the future.
    National Day Special Articles Will Be Compiled and Published
    Some readers have suggested that our newspaper compile the special articles commemorating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the articles about the National Congress of Heroes, published around National Day, and publish them into two books for readers to study and preserve.
    It is understood that the National Day special articles published in our newspaper will be compiled and published by the People's Daily Press. As for the articles about the National Congress of Heroes, they will be compiled and published by other publishers.

    关于引用经典作家著作的建议
    人民日报8月30日刊载的“马克思主义者应当如何对待革命的群众运动”和9月1日孙定国同志的“必须正确对待革命的群众运动”两文，都引用了列宁谈到马克思对巴黎公社的评价时所说的一段话，但是译文却不尽相同。另外几段引文也有这种情况。引用经典作家同一著作而译文不同，在其他文章、书刊中也常常见到。有些翻译工作者遇到经典作家的警句名言，有时为了避免查阅的麻烦，也不引用已有的中译本。这样就给读者带来不便，而且造成引文的混乱。我向作者、翻译工作者提出一个建议：希望引用经典作家言论时，尽量引用已有的中译本，而且引用最新的版本	    武汉大学　阮伟昕
    用辞不当
    11月3日一版“城乡购销两旺”消息中提到“增产节约运动的进一步开展……机关集团购买力显著下降”。购买力下降是资本主义社会由于生产停滞或下降，失业工人增多，物价上涨等所产生的衰退现象，这种现象在社会主义国家是不会产生的。相反，随着社会主义建设的迅速发展，生产不断扩大，社会购买力总是不断增长。最近，由于各方面厉行节约，贯彻勤俭办一切事业的精神，机关、团体压缩了经常开支，向市场上购买的东西比以前减少了，这是很好的现象，不能说成购买力下降。

    希望各版经常发表来信
    在人民日报八版上时常出现“观众的话”、“读者谈书”、“读者中来”、“大家谈”等栏目，反映读者的意见和要求，我感到很好。七版上也注意发表读者来信，像11月15日的“感谢优秀影片对我们的教育”专页就很吸引人。可是近来其它版上很少发表读者来信，听不到直接来自读者的声音。希望各版都能经常发表来信，不要时有时无。

    近来，人民日报上的读者来信登得较少。我认为读者来信栏具有广泛的群众性，可以加强党同广大人民群众的联系，也可以启发广大读者关心党和人民的报纸宣传工作，并从中得到教益。希望在报上经常看到这一栏。
                天津　张梦周
    编者按：读者的意见很好。本报今后将注意在各版更多地发表来信。
    国庆专文将汇集出书
    有读者来信建议本报将国庆前后发表的建国十周年纪念专文和有关群英会的文章汇集起来，出版两本书，便于读者学习和保存。
    据了解，本报发表的国庆专文，将由人民日报出版社汇集出书。至于群英会的文章，将由其他出版社汇集出书。
