Broad and Vast Friendship
Vice President of the Sino-Mongolian Friendship Association
Head of the Sino-Mongolian Friendship Association Delegation Mao Qihua

At the invitation of the Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Association, the Sino-Mongolian Friendship Association delegation recently paid a three-week friendly visit to the Mongolian People's Republic and participated in the friendly activities held by the Mongolian people to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of our country.

Beginning on September 16th, the Mongolian-Chinese friendship activities were held throughout Mongolia for fifteen days. On the vast land of Mongolia, from cities to villages, from the capital Ulaanbaatar to every corner of the grasslands, a festive atmosphere prevailed everywhere. On the solemn Sukhbaatar Square, the national flags of China and Mongolia flew high; in front of the State Theater, huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Chairman Tsedenbal were hung. In every town and village throughout the country, in every sum (county), slogans were posted everywhere, cheering our National Day and cheering the friendship between China and Mongolia. In factories and mines, in farms and cooperatives, in government offices and schools, everywhere could be seen the fraternal Mongolian people warmly celebrating the glorious festival of our people. Wherever we went, we were met with the warmest welcome and the most cordial reception. The hospitable Mongolian herdsmen treated us with the most solemn national etiquette, presented us with Hada scarves, and specially organized the Nadaam festival for us, performing wrestling and horse racing. When we arrived in many places, we heard the Young Pioneers singing "The East is Red" to greet us. Although we do not speak Mongolian, this kind of close brotherly affection moved us deeply. The thoughts and feelings of the Chinese and Mongolian people are so closely connected and harmoniously integrated that we felt as if we were celebrating the National Day in our own country.

On the eve of the "October 1st" National Day, we participated in the rally held by people from all walks of life in Ulaanbaatar to celebrate our National Day, and also participated in the get-together of workers and herdsmen. Whether it was party and government leaders, or ordinary workers and herdsmen, they all warmly congratulated the Chinese people on the great achievements they have made in the past ten years under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of all ethnic groups in our country, Comrade Mao Zedong. They regarded the festival of our people as their own festival; they regarded the achievements of our people as their own achievements. This most vividly demonstrates the deep friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people, a friendship built on the great foundation of proletarian internationalism, which will forever radiate brilliant light like the sun.

We visited many places in Mongolia with excitement in an exceptionally friendly atmosphere.

Mongolia is a country with vast land and rich resources, known for its animal husbandry. According to the national population, there are an average of twenty-seven head of livestock per person. Since the victory of the People's Revolution, the Mongolian people, under the leadership of the People's Revolutionary Party and the government, have achieved brilliant achievements in socialist revolution and construction. In 1959, agricultural and pastoral cooperation was realized throughout the country, and all farmers and herdsmen embarked on the broad road of socialism. Since then, the entire national economy has become a single socialist economy. With the elimination of the individual economy, in order to adapt to the requirements of new economic development, the administrative structure was reformed, and the combination of sum (county) and cooperative was implemented, and the institutions at the Bago (township) level were abolished. After the reform, there were more than 420 sum-cooperatives in the country. In order to strengthen the leadership of the cooperatives, many cadres of the organs responded to the call of the Party Central Committee, went down to the cooperatives, and participated in the production leadership work at the grassroots level. In this way, the "integration of government and society" was implemented, which not only brought the leadership closer to production, improved work efficiency, streamlined the organization, and saved the state's administrative expenses, but also strengthened the leadership of the cooperatives. This plays a significant role in promoting the accelerated development of agriculture and animal husbandry. The responsible comrades of many cooperatives we visited told us that they are working hard to realize the settlement of herdsmen. The Party and the government are very concerned about and attach great importance to the development of animal husbandry and the settlement of herdsmen. Many agricultural and pastoral machinery stations and basic construction offices have been set up throughout the country to help cooperatives with grass cutting, shearing, land cultivation and house construction. We are very happy to see that many beautiful new-style houses and warehouses have been built in the central areas of each sum-cooperative; many tractors are running on the grasslands, turning up the black oily land that has been sleeping for many years. Mongolian comrades told us that the Party Central Committee has put forward a great call to achieve complete self-sufficiency in flour by 1961. This is a very exciting call. Because the development of agriculture in Mongolia is of great significance, it will not only make flour self-sufficient, but also establish a solid feed base, promote the development of animal husbandry, and create conditions for the settled life of herdsmen. We have seen with our own eyes that the vast number of farmers and herdsmen in Mongolia are enthusiastically working to realize this call.

Mongolia was originally a pastoral country. However, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government, thanks to the hard work of the Mongolian people, the face of Mongolia has undergone fundamental changes, transforming from a backward nomadic country into an agricultural-pastoral-industrial country. With infinite respect, we visited many expanded and newly built light and heavy industrial enterprises. These factories and mines are mechanized and automated. The Nalaihe Coal Mine, about 40 kilometers from Ulaanbaatar, is one of the earliest industrial enterprises in Mongolia. When this coal mine was built in 1922, it only had more than 20 workers and produced 800 tons of coal per year; but today, just one of the large mines that was officially put into production in 1958 has 1,200 employees and a daily output of 1,000 tons. The employees of this coal mine take pride in being able to supply coal to the capital, actively participate in production competitions, and are enthusiastic about work, determined to strive to complete and overfulfill this year's production tasks. The Choibalsan Industrial Combine Factory is the largest livestock product processing factory in Mongolia. In the 26 years since its establishment, production has greatly developed. The number of workers has increased fivefold, and the output has increased seventeenfold. At present, the factory is still undergoing large-scale expansion, and two newly built branches – a woolen mill and a shoe factory – will soon be put into production. From the development of these two factories, we have seen the epitome of the rapid development of Mongolian industry, and at the same time, we have seen that under the socialist system, the working class can exert endless wisdom and creativity.

We also visited hospitals, sanatoriums, schools and various cultural undertakings. With the tremendous development of production, Mongolia's cultural and educational undertakings are also flourishing. At present, universal primary education has been implemented throughout the country, and seven-year compulsory education has begun to be popularized in large towns. This year, all graduates of ten-year complete middle schools can be admitted to universities. During our visit to Mongolia, it was the autumn harvest season. Many middle school and university students went to the countryside to help with the autumn harvest. The person in charge of the school told us that in order to implement the policy of combining education with production, senior students participate in 30 to 45 days of physical labor every year, and other grades also have labor courses. This policy has brought good results to the development of education. Many workers have entered spare-time schools to study culture and technology. In order to welcome the 40th anniversary of the victory of the People's Revolution (July 11, 1961), the Central Committee of the People's Revolutionary Party called on the entire people to march towards culture. People enthusiastically responded to this call and set off a wave of learning. Undoubtedly, this movement is of extremely great significance to the development of socialist culture.

The tremendous achievements made by the Mongolian people in economic and cultural construction have made our people jubilant. We wish them more brilliant victories in the struggle to complete and overfulfill the three-year plan (1958-1960) for the development of the national economy and culture.

Now, we have left the Mongolian People's Republic, bringing back the fragrance of the grasslands and full of the deep friendship of the Mongolian people. Although we have said goodbye to the fraternal Mongolian people, the deep friendship of the Mongolian people towards our country is something we will never forget. We will convey the profound friendship of the Mongolian people to our people, and report on the heroic spirit and great achievements of the Mongolian people in building socialism that we have seen with our own eyes.

Tomorrow (November 26) is the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Mongolian People's Republic. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the Mongolian People's Republic on its glorious achievements over the past 35 years. We firmly believe that the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people will surely continue to develop and play an important role in promoting the socialist construction of the two countries and safeguarding world peace.

    广阔浩瀚的友谊
    中蒙友好协会副会长
    中蒙友好协会代表团团长  毛齐华
    中蒙友好协会代表团应蒙中友好协会的邀请，不久以前在蒙古人民共和国作了三个星期的友好访问，并参加了蒙古人民为庆祝我国建国十周年而举办的友好活动。
    从9月16日开始，蒙古全国各地举行了为时十五天的蒙中友好活动。在蒙古辽阔的土地上，从城市到乡村，从首都乌兰巴托一直到草原上每一个角落，到处洋溢着节日的欢乐气氛。在庄严的苏赫巴托尔广场上，中蒙两国的国旗，高高飘扬；国家剧院门前，悬挂了毛主席和泽登巴尔主席的巨幅画像。在全国各个城镇，在每一个苏木（县），到处张贴着欢呼我国国庆、欢呼中蒙友谊的标语。在工厂和矿山，在农场和合作社，在机关和学校，到处都可以看到兄弟般的蒙古人民热烈地欢庆我国人民光辉的节日。我们无论走到哪里，都受到了最热烈的欢迎和亲切的接待。好客的蒙古牧民们用最隆重的民族礼节招待我们，给我们献哈达，为我们专门组织了那达慕大会，表演摔跤和赛马。我们到达许多地方，都听见红领巾唱起“东方红”迎接我们。我们虽然不通蒙语，但是这种亲切如手足的情谊，使我们深受感动。中蒙两国人民的思想感情是这样息息相通、水乳交融，使我们感到就像在祖国欢庆国庆节一样。
    “十·一”国庆节前夕，我们参加了乌兰巴托市各界群众庆祝我国国庆节的大会，也参加了工人和牧民的联欢会。无论是党政领导人，或是普通的工人和牧民，都热烈地祝贺我国人民十年来在中国共产党和我国各族人民伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的领导下所取得的巨大成就。他们把我国人民的节日看做是自己的节日；把我国人民的成就看做是自己的成就。这最生动地表现了中蒙两国人民的深厚友谊，这种友谊是建立在伟大的无产阶级国际主义基础上的，它将像太阳一样永远发射出灿烂的光辉。
    我们在异常友好的气氛中，怀着兴奋的心情到蒙古许多地方，进行了参观访问。
    蒙古是一个土地辽阔、物产富饶的国家，素以畜牧业著称。按全国人口计算，平均每人有牲畜二十七头之多。自人民革命胜利后，蒙古人民在人民革命党和政府的领导下，在社会主义革命和建设方面获得了光辉的成就。1959年在全国范围内实现了农牧业合作化，全体农牧民走上了社会主义的康庄大道。从此，整个国民经济变成了单一的社会主义经济了。随着个体经济的消灭，为了适应新的经济发展的要求，改革了行政机构，实行苏木（县）和合作社合一，撤销了巴戈（乡）一级的机构。改革以后，全国共有四百二十多个苏木——合作社。为了加强对合作社的领导，许多机关干部响应了党中央的号召，下放到合作社，参加基层的生产领导工作。这样，实行了“政社合一”，不但使领导更接近生产，提高了工作效率，精简了机构，节省了国家的行政开支，而且加强了对合作社的领导。这对促进农牧业的加速发展，具有重大的作用。我们参观的许多合作社的负责同志告诉我们，他们正在努力实现牧民定居。党和政府对畜牧业发展和牧民定居十分关怀和重视。在全国遍设了许多农牧业机械站和基本建设处，帮助各合作社打草、剪毛、耕种土地和建设房屋。我们非常高兴地看到，各苏木——合作社的中心区已经建立起不少漂亮的新式住宅、仓库；许多拖拉机在草原上奔驰，翻起了沉睡多年的黑油油的土地。蒙古同志告诉我们，党中央提出了伟大的号召，到1961年面粉完全达到自给。这是一个十分振奋人心的号召。因为，在蒙古发展农业有着巨大的意义，它不仅将使面粉自给自足，而且将建立巩固的饲料基地，促进畜牧业的发展，为牧民的定居生活创造条件。我们亲眼看到，蒙古的广大农牧民正在为实现这一号召而热情地劳动着。
    蒙古原是一个畜牧业国家。但是，在蒙古人民革命党和政府的领导下，由于蒙古人民的辛勤劳动，蒙古的面貌已经发生了根本的变化，从一个落后的游牧国家变成为农牧业—工业国家。我们怀着无限的敬意，参观了许多扩建和新建的轻重工业企业。这些厂矿都是机械化自动化的。距乌兰巴托约四十公里的那来河煤矿，是蒙古最早的工业企业之一。这个煤矿在1922年建矿时，还只有二十多个工人，年产八百吨煤；而今天，只是其中的一个在1958年正式投入生产的大矿，就有一千二百名职工，日产量达到一千吨。这个煤矿的职工以能供应首都用煤为光荣，积极参加生产竞赛，劳动热情高涨，决心争取完成和超额完成今年的生产任务。乔巴山工业联合工厂是蒙古最大的畜产品加工工厂，在它建厂的二十六年当中，生产有了很大的发展。工人增加了五倍，产品增加了十七倍。目前，这个工厂还在大规模的扩建，新建的两个分厂——毛纺厂和制鞋厂即将投入生产。我们从这两个工厂的发展，看到了蒙古工业迅速发展的缩影，同时也看到，在社会主义制度下，工人阶级能够发挥无穷无尽的智慧和创造力量。
    我们也参观了医院、疗养院、学校和各种文化事业。随着生产事业的巨大发展，蒙古的文化教育事业也在蒸蒸日上。目前，全国已经实行了普及小学教育，在大城镇开始实行普及七年制义务教育，今年十年制完全中学的毕业生全部可以升入大学。我们在蒙古访问的期间正值秋收季节。许多中学生和大学生下乡帮助秋收。学校的负责人告诉我们，为贯彻教育与生产相结合的方针，高年级的学生，每年每人参加三十天到四十五天的体力劳动，其他各年级也设有劳动课程，这一方针已为教育事业的发展带来了良好的效果。许多工人进了业余学校，学习文化和技术。为了迎接人民革命胜利的四十周年（1961年7月11日），人民革命党中央号召全民向文化大进军。人们都热烈响应这一号召，掀起了学习高潮。无疑的，这个运动对社会主义文化事业的发展，有极其重大的意义。
    蒙古人民在经济和文化建设中所取得的巨大成就，使我国人民欢欣鼓舞。我们预祝他们在为完成和超额完成发展国民经济及文化的三年计划（1958—1960年）的斗争中，获得更加辉煌的胜利。
    现在，我们已经离开了蒙古人民共和国，带着草原的芳香，满载蒙古人民深厚的友谊回到了祖国。我们虽然告别了兄弟般的蒙古人民，但是，蒙古人民对我国那种深厚的友谊，是我们永远不能忘怀的。我们将把蒙古人民的隆情厚谊传达给我国人民，并汇报我们亲眼看到的蒙古人民建设社会主义的英雄气概和伟大成就。
    明天（11月26日）是蒙古人民共和国成立三十五周年纪念日。中国人民热烈祝贺蒙古人民共和国三十五年来的光辉成就。我们深信，中蒙两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊必将获得不断的发展，并对促进两国社会主义建设和保卫世界和平的事业发挥重要的作用。
