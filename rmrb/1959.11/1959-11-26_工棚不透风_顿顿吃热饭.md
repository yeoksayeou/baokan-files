    Sheds are Airtight, Hot Meals Served Every Meal

    With the arrival of winter and the cooling climate, the Party Committee of the Gongshang Reservoir in Linxian County, Henan Province, to ensure that the migrant workers eat warm, dress warm, and live warm, added eighty large pots and one hundred and twenty warming vats to the one hundred and twenty construction site canteens, ensuring that the rice is always kept hot in the pot, guaranteeing hot meals every meal. The construction site Party committee also conducted a comprehensive inspection of housing, organizing migrant workers at each construction site to take measures such as stone pressing, rope tying, and pole bracing to prevent the houses from being blown down by strong winds. Leaky houses were universally repaired, and twenty large sheds were used for covering. The reservoir Party committee also mobilized the migrant workers to cut 200,000 jin of cogon grass, covering all 180 tents and mat sheds with grass, and hanging self-made grass curtains on doors and windows. Windbreak walls were also set up in wind-facing areas, and stoves were installed indoors. This ensured that every room was airtight, and everyone could rest well in a warm place.

    The construction site Party committee also organized ten sewing groups, which made 180 cotton-padded clothes in five days, solving the problem of winter clothing for single men. Ten thousand migrant workers, everyone eating hot meals, living in warm houses, and wearing cotton-padded clothes, faced the cold wind and fought against stubborn rocks. A new situation of high morale and high work efficiency emerged on the construction site, and the efficiency of earth and stone works increased by 50%.

    工棚不透风　顿顿吃热饭
    冬季来临，气候变冷。河南林县弓上水库党委为了保证民工吃暖、穿暖、住暖，在一百二十个工地食堂中，增加了八十口大锅和一百二十个暖缸，做到饭不离锅，保证顿顿吃热饭。工地党委并对住房作了全面检查，组织各工地民工采取石压、绳拴、杆挡等办法防止大风刮倒房屋。漏雨的房屋，普遍进行修理，并用二十个大棚加以遮盖。水库党委还发动民工割了二十万斤白茅草，将一百八十间帐棚和席棚全部苫上了草，门窗上都挂上了民工们自制的草帘，迎风地方还设置了挡风墙，室内设备了火炉。这就做到了间间房屋不透风，人人住暖休息好。
    工地党委又组织了十个缝纫小组，五天内制作棉衣一百八十件，解决了单身汉的冬衣问题。万名民工，人人吃着热饭，住着暖房，穿着棉衣，迎着寒风与顽石作斗争。工地上出现了个个干劲足、工效高的新局面，土石方工程效率提高了50％。
