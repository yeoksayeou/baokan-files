Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 3rd: Liu Changsheng, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and head of the Chinese Trade Union Delegation, delivered a congratulatory message at the Third National Congress of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea this morning.

The congratulatory message stated that China and Korea are as closely related as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe. The people of the two countries are as close as brothers, sharing common interests. We are not only close comrades-in-arms in the struggle against imperialist aggression headed by the United States, but also brothers who support and learn from each other in the cause of peaceful construction. The friendship between the people of China and Korea is traditional, embodying the blood-and-flesh ties between our two peoples and reflecting a high degree of proletarian internationalism. "The friendly unity of our two countries within the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union cannot be undermined by any force in the world."

The congratulatory message said that the diligent and brave Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, are engaged in selfless labor to accelerate socialist construction. The Korean people have mounted the Chollima (Thousand-Li Horse), advancing at full speed with heroic spirit. The entire northern part of Korea presents a thriving scene like the morning sun, which is in stark contrast to the southern part of Korea, which has become a living hell. The congratulatory message emphasized, "The Chinese working people cheer for the great achievements already made by the fraternal Korean people and wish them even greater achievements."

The congratulatory message said, "Under the leadership of the Workers' Party, the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea has played a significant role in the restoration of the economy and the construction of the first Five-Year Plan, especially in carrying out competitions and the current Chollima work team movement, as well as in employee education and caring for the lives of employees."

The congratulatory message said, "While we cheer for the great achievements made by the Korean people, we cannot help but feel very angry that American imperialism, disregarding the strong desire of the Korean people for the reunification of their motherland, continues to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. We resolutely demand that the United States and other countries participating in the United Nations forces withdraw all their armed forces from Korea, allowing the Korean people to peacefully unify their country without any external interference. The Chinese workers and the people of the whole country resolutely support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their beautiful motherland, and resolutely support the proposal for the peaceful reunification of Korea put forward by the Sixth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of Korea. We firmly believe that the Korean people will achieve final victory in this struggle."

After discussing the tremendous changes in China over the past ten years, the congratulatory message said, "Inspired by the Party's call for opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and launching an increase production and practice economy campaign, the workers and the entire people of our country have launched a vigorous mass movement, setting off a magnificent production upsurge. The National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in the fields of industry, transportation, capital construction, finance, and trade, currently being held in Beijing, is a testament to the continued Great Leap Forward and a grand review of production achievements. The workers across the country are fighting with full confidence to victoriously achieve the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan within this year, that is, three years ahead of schedule." The congratulatory message also said, "At present, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the trade unions in our country are vigorously enhancing the communist consciousness of workers, giving play to their enthusiasm and creativity, and further launching socialist labor competitions to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced. We will further carry out technical revolution and technical innovation, actively promote advanced production experience, learn advanced technologies from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, so that workers can not only work hard but also work skillfully, and trade unions will continue to care about improving the material and cultural levels of the vast number of workers."

    刘长胜向朝鲜职业总同盟代表大会致贺词
    祝朝鲜人民快马加鞭取得更大成就
    据新华社平壤3日电　中华全国总工会副主席、中国工会代表团团长刘长胜今天上午在朝鲜职业总同盟第三次全国代表大会会议上致贺词。
    贺词说，我们中朝两国唇齿相依，安危与共。两国人民亲如手足，休戚相关。我们不仅是反对以美国为首的帝国主义侵略斗争中的亲密战友，在和平建设事业中，我们也是相互支援、相互学习的兄弟。中朝两国人民的友谊是传统的，它体现了我们两国人民的血肉相连的关系，体现了高度的无产阶级国际主义精神。“我们两国在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中的友好团结，是世界上任何力量也破坏不了的。”
    贺词说，勤劳、勇敢的朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的领导下正在为加速社会主义建设进行着忘我的劳动。朝鲜人民跨上千里马，以豪迈的气概，快马加鞭地前进。整个朝鲜北部像早上的太阳一样呈现出一片欣欣向荣的景象，这和朝鲜南部成为一个人间地狱是一个极其强烈的对比。贺词强调说，“中国劳动人民为兄弟的朝鲜人民已经取得的巨大成就而欢呼，并且预祝他们取得更大的成就。”
    贺词说，“朝鲜职业总同盟在劳动党的领导下，在恢复经济和第一个五年计划建设中，特别是在开展竞赛和目前的千里马作业班运动中，在职工教育和关心职工生活方面起了巨大作用。”
    贺词说，“当我们为朝鲜人民所取得的伟大成就而欢呼的时候，我们不能不感到非常愤怒的是美帝国主义不顾朝鲜人民统一祖国的强烈愿望，继续阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。我们坚决要求美国和参加联合国军的其他国家从朝鲜撤出它们的一切武装力量，让朝鲜人民在不受任何外来干涉的情况下和平统一自己的国家。中国工人和全国人民坚决支持朝鲜人民为争取自己美丽的祖国的和平统一而进行的斗争，坚决支持第二届朝鲜最高人民会议第六次会议提出的和平统一朝鲜的方案。我们深信朝鲜人民在这一斗争中一定会取得最后胜利。”
    贺词在谈到中国十年来的巨大变化以后说，“我国职工和全体人民在党所提出的反右倾、鼓干劲，开展增产节约运动的号召鼓舞下，开展了一个轰轰烈烈的群众运动，掀起了波澜壮阔的生产高潮。目前正在北京举行的全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会，就是继续大跃进的证明和生产成就的大检阅。全国职工正信心百倍地为胜利地实现在今年内，即提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标的战斗任务而奋斗。”贺词又说，“目前，我国工会在各级党委的领导下，大力提高职工的共产主义觉悟，发挥职工的积极性和创造性，进一步开展比先进、学先进、赶先进的社会主义劳动竞赛。进一步大闹技术革命和技术革新，积极地推广先进的生产经验，学习苏联和其他社会主义国家的先进技术，做到职工既能苦干，又能巧干，工会也不断关怀广大职工的物质和文化水平的提高。”
