"Frost-Defying Flowers Bloom on Lingnan Branches"
    ——A Review of the Historical Film "Lin Zexu"
    Wuchang, Central China Normal University  Zhang Kaiyuan

In the autumn of 1843, Lin Zexu, who had been exiled to Xinjiang by the Qing Dynasty rulers for his role in the opium prohibition, was stranded there. Under the bright moon of the Tianshan Mountains, amid the cold night watch and the desolate cries of soldiers, with white grass and yellow elms stretching across the vast wilderness, feelings of concern for his country, his family, and his own fate surged in his heart. He could not help but sigh with sorrow and indignation, uttering the lines: "Crossroads upon crossroads, only filled with emotion," "Who in history will determine right and wrong?" ("Sending Xie Yun Home with Imperial Favors").

History is the most impartial judge. One hundred and sixteen years later, the film "Lin Zexu" clearly judges the rights and wrongs of this historical case from modern Chinese history. The reactionary rulers who colluded with foreign capitalist aggressors and turned China into a semi-colony are subjected to the most severe condemnation. The Chinese people, who resolutely resisted foreign aggression and national traitors, are warmly praised. Lin Zexu, Guan Tianpei, and others who actively resisted foreign aggression and made outstanding contributions also receive the recognition they deserve.

Thanks to the screenwriters, directors, and actors of the film, they successfully brought this glorious first page of modern Chinese history to the screen, providing our audience with a profound lesson in patriotism.

How to deal with historical subjects like the Opium War is indeed a difficult question to solve. Having engaged in the teaching and research of modern Chinese history for many years, I particularly appreciate the depth of effort put in by the film's creators.

The first important task is how to highlight the mainstream of history. Chairman Mao said: "The process of imperialism and Chinese feudalism combining to turn China into a semi-colony and colony is also the process of the Chinese people resisting imperialism and its running dogs. From the Opium War, the Taiping Rebellion… the Boxer Rebellion… all demonstrated the Chinese people's indomitable spirit of resistance to imperialism and its running dogs." The former process is a negative and dark aspect of modern Chinese history and not the mainstream of history. The latter process is a positive and progressive aspect, which is the mainstream of history and the object we should focus on describing and eulogizing. The film "Lin Zexu" precisely "demonstrates the Chinese people's indomitable spirit of resistance to imperialism and its running dogs" through this historical event of the Opium War. The screenwriters and directors meticulously sorted out and boldly edited the complex and cluttered historical facts, arranging the ending of the story as a scene of the struggle of the Pingying Tuan heroes, thus highlighting the prominent position of the colorful opium prohibition movement and the heroic struggle of the patriotic soldiers and civilians of Guangdong in the film. The film's creators strived to portray the reactionary and negative aspects of this period of history only as a foil. For example, after the fall of Dinghai, when the Qing rulers began to waver and surrender under the military intimidation of the invading army, the screen first shows the encroaching British warships, and then cuts to a few shots of the Daoguang Emperor panicking and accepting Qishan and others' proposals for surrender. With just a few strokes, the development and changes of the reactionary capitulationist line, which was opposed to the people's line of resolute resistance, are vividly depicted. It is precisely because the screenwriters and directors have such skillful writing that the entire film can maintain a strong and full combat atmosphere and a firm and progressive optimistic color, without being damaged by the healthy tone of the film due to the depiction of the dark and reactionary aspects of history.

Like the national wars in the period of the old democratic revolution such as the Opium War, the records of the people's struggle in historical records are very brief and fragmented, mainly because the cultural undertakings at that time were controlled by the landlord class. In order to make up for this shortcoming, it is necessary to organically combine historical truth with artistic imagination, and to systematize and complete the brief and sporadic deeds related to the people's struggle. The film's screenwriters and directors brilliantly accomplished this task. They created three vivid images of people's heroes: Kuang Dongshan, Mai Kuan, and Aunt Kuan, using their tragic experiences and resistance activities to connect many scenes of the people's anti-aggression struggle, such as surrounding foreign factories, intercepting "diandee" (opium carrying boats), attacking British warships, and the Pingying Tuan, before and after. And through their several contacts with Lin Zexu (such as the conversation on the ferry, the note left after intercepting "diandee", the meeting at Humen destruction of opium and the construction site of the battery, and even the presentation of the plaque after Lin Zexu was dismissed), the influence and promotion of the people's strong will and fighting power on some patriotic people in the ruling class is also clearly explained. In this way, the outline of the story is very complete, enhancing the drama of the plot, and the entire film appears coherent.

Kuang Dongshan, Mai Kuan, and Aunt Kuan are originally characters that did not exist in history, but they make the audience feel a sense of reality. This is mainly because the screenwriters, directors, and actors based the shaping of these characters on a deep study of historical truth, and then carried out artistic generalization and processing. Are these three not the representatives of the most active and resolute fishermen, boat people, and "machine room boys" who resisted foreign aggression during the Opium War? On their bodies, the dazzling spiritual flame of the working people is strongly projected. However, they are not ordinary working people, they are outstanding representatives among the working people. Kuang Dongshan's sophistication and heroism, Mai Kuan's simplicity and bravery, and Aunt Kuan's enthusiasm and straightforwardness all leave a deep impression on the audience. The careful screenwriters and actors did not forget to comprehensively portray the spiritual outlook of the working people in that era. The scenes of worshiping gods in the Xuan Emperor Temple and sending plaques to Lin Zexu made the audience clearly understand that the people at that time had not been completely liberated from the rule of feudal ideology. This is mutually corroborated with historical materials such as the Guangdong Yimin's declaration denouncing the British, which is also in line with the actual situation at that time.

The film profoundly illustrates through the legendary stories of Kuang Dongshan and others and several large-scale mass struggle scenes that opposing the opium trade and opposing armed aggression are completely in line with the people's will and receive the strong support of the workers and peasants. If Lin Zexu had once made shocking contributions at home and abroad for a period of time, it was mainly because he saw the available popular support and relied on the strong public power to some extent. The film explains the great truth of Marxism-Leninism about the working people being the masters of history in vivid artistic language.

The film is particularly successful in shaping the character of "Lin Zexu". If you carefully check "Lin Zexu's Diary", "Yunzuo Mountain Villa Poetry Collection", "Letters and Records", "Records of the Yi Atmosphere" and related biographies, you will find that Lin Zexu in the film is so similar to the Lin Zexu of that time in terms of ideological character, style of work, living habits, and even the shaping of his appearance. When leaving the cinema, every audience member will not forget for a long time such a patriotic, caring, shrewd, capable, and emotionally rich heroic image. It must be said that this is another exquisite crystallization of historical truth and artistic imagination.

The film correctly handles the profound contradiction between Lin Zexu's loyalty to the emperor and his love for the country. Driven by a strong patriotic heart, he used the power of the people to a certain extent and created brilliant achievements in the anti-aggression struggle, and therefore was supported and loved by the people at that time. However, he was still the "Lin Wenzhong Gong" of the Qing Dynasty to the end, and always maintained an insurmountable boundary with the people. The people bravely and firmly took their own road of resistance, but he could only obey the Daoguang Emperor he was loyal to, and it was this emperor who finally combined with the capitulationists and completely destroyed Lin Zexu's cause. Lin Zexu's ideals and actions clashed strongly with the class environment in which he was in, which could not but arouse deep resentment in the heart of this passionate and resolute person. However, the resentment was hidden in his heart. The film, through a few shots, such as the look in his eyes when receiving the decree in front of Qishan, the facial expression when his official hat was removed, and the "Lisao" placed on the table when he was recuperating behind closed doors, truthfully expresses his restrained dissatisfaction. At the end of the film, there is a clear contrast on the screen: on the one hand, the Pingying Tuan bravely defeats the British aggressors, foreshadowing that the heroic, magnificent, and vigorous people's resistance struggle is constantly developing; on the other hand, Lin Zexu walks lonely and sadly on the road of exile, alone chewing on the painful experience of his family, country, and his own life. Maybe it can be said that this biographical film is a tragedy? Isn't Lin Zexu's great cause buried in the deep contradictions that he himself cannot overcome? However, the film does not only limit itself to arousing the audience's sympathy for Lin Zexu's personal fate, but more guides the audience to see the magnificent power and bright prospects of the people's struggle. It is precisely because of this that the film exudes the brilliance of thought and artistic charm.

It is impossible not to mention Comrade Zhao Dan, the leading actor, who created the image of the historical figure Lin Zexu truthfully and profoundly. The righteousness and awe-inspiring when denouncing Elliot to his face and solemnly declaring his determination to ban opium, the effort to restrain his emotional excitement after hating the traitorous officials and breaking the teacup in anger, the soft but hard, alert and sophisticated when dealing with political enemies, the long-term disappointment when saying goodbye to Deng Tingzhen and watching the lonely sail and the clouds, the gratitude and motivation when accepting the gifts of plaques from the masses... everywhere is appropriately showing a patriotic literati with a high sense of justice, rich political experience, profound cultural accomplishments, and a temperament that is upright, resolute, and quite aware of restraint and restraint. It can be seen that Comrade Zhao Dan also absorbed some beneficial parts of the Chinese traditional opera program in terms of movements and dialogues. The kneeling when seeing the emperor, the gesture when pouring wine, and even the whole body movement when taking off the official hat, all appear very clean and neat, with strong and unrestrained lines. When Lin Zexu was in a fierce dispute with Qishan, trying to save the precarious situation for the last time but was finally rejected, Lin Zexu suppressed his anger and said sadly: "Lin Mou has not failed the emperor and the country, and has not failed the common people...". The language was simply burst out word by word, making a clang of gold and stone. Generally speaking, there are not many dialogues in the film, and the inner activities of the characters are mainly expressed through the development of the plot, complexion, eyes, a gesture, a throw of the foot, and so on. This marks that the writing, directing, and acting techniques of Chinese films have entered a new stage.

Several actors who played the villain also have excellent performances. The Daoguang Emperor's vanity and cowardice, Mu Zhanga's insidious and despicable, Qishan's greed and tyranny, Wu Shaorong's servile flattery, and even Elliot's cunning and viciousness... all reveal their reactionary class nature and social status, and also highlight their respective unique personalities. Although some people do not have many opportunities to appear on the screen, they leave a clear impression on the audience.

There are indeed many virtual things in the film in terms of story arrangement and character shaping, and even some are not completely consistent with historical facts, but all of these can make the audience believe its authenticity, as if they are all things that actually happened. Why can such an artistic effect be achieved? This is because the virtual and processed parts are based on historical truth and necessity. Although there is no record of a legendary hero like Kuang Dongshan in historical books, it was completely possible to exist at that time. Isn't the Black Water Party on the coast of Zhejiang clear evidence? Although the experience and deeds of Mai Kuan this character are virtual, aren't there thousands of characters similar to Mai Kuan among the people of Guangdong at that time? Can't we see the mighty image of the peasant hero Wei Shaoguang and others in Sanyuanli in Mai Kuan? With truthfulness as the basis and without being too constrained by its limitations, in the world of historical necessity and possibility, the miraculous artistic conception has a vast wilderness to gallop. Isn't it always someone who overemphasizes the difficulty of creating historical dramas? Please take a look at "Lin Zexu", it will eloquently show that China's long, rich, and magnificent historical materials are extending enthusiastic welcoming hands to artists.

Respect for historical truth must not be confused with objectivism and naturalism. The good thing about the film "Lin Zexu" is not only that it has a deep historical truthfulness foundation, but more importantly that it strongly blows our current great spirit of the times. Because history is a thing of the past, but the screenwriters, directors, actors, and audience are people of the present. The style of the work must be adapted to the atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward in our country's socialist construction today. I particularly love "Lin Zexu" precisely because it sweeps away the old Chinese history's gray tones of darkness, misery, humiliation, and negativity, and is full of strong colors suitable for the current spirit of the times such as national self-confidence, determination, fortitude, bravery, and optimism. The content structure, acting skills, emotional ups and downs, development rhythm, and even the set, sound, light, and color of this film are compact, strong, magnificent, and vivid. Especially at the time of the 10th anniversary of the National Day, when the whole country was jubilant, seeing this movie was really extraordinarily uplifting and doubled our enthusiasm. It should be believed that the creators of the film (including the collective labor and collective wisdom of all staff) kept a close eye on the pulse of the times and had the ideological feelings of breathing and sharing fate with the people, so that this film could have a valuable style of the times.

There are a few places in this film that seem to need improvement, and I would like to make some sporadic suggestions below.

The film seems to be too cursory in reflecting the serious harm caused by the opium trade to the working people. There are only two or three shots of porters carrying heavy opium boxes and the blind girl's husband rushing into a dilapidated and dark opium den. This cannot more powerfully illustrate why the masses of the people have such a deep hatred for the opium trade. Similarly, there is a lack of due description of the aggressors' atrocities against the people, which weakens the emotional foundation of the masses "everyone holding a knife to kill" the aggressors. In addition, the clothing and housing of the masses seem to be slightly "rich", and not very much like they are being cruelly oppressed by feudal forces. The filmmakers may be worried that truthfully depicting these dark scenes will destroy the healthy atmosphere of the entire film, but I think that a few accompanying shots will not damage the tone of the entire film. On the contrary, it will make it more vivid and strong. As an educator, I deeply feel that it is still very beneficial to let the people, especially the younger generation, regularly review the historical disasters of semi-colonialism today. This will make us love the motherland, the Communist Party, and socialism even more, and at the same time enhance our hatred and vigilance against imperialism and its running dogs.

Some of the descriptions of the details seem to be a little too trivial, such as Lin and Deng's private visit and the destruction of opium at Humen. If it is more concise, the effect may be even better. But before the Qing Dynasty monarchs and ministers discuss the issue of opium prohibition, if you can insert the scene of the mass demonstration of 10,000 people in Guangzhou on December 12, 1838 in front of the opium dealers' residences (slightly shifting the time sequence), this may make the status of the mainstream of the people's struggle even more prominent. Originally, the appointment of the resistance faction and the realization of the opium prohibition movement were based on the people's strong will and heroic struggle. Lin Zexu did not say long ago: "Observing public opinion, it is not impossible to save"?

As a biographical film, the description of the protagonist Lin Zexu seems to be insufficient. What the screenwriters and directors portrayed is only Lin Zexu's patriotism and resistance to foreign aggression (which is naturally the main aspect), but they missed the other aspect of being enlightened and progressive and willing to learn from the capitalist West (although not the main aspect, it is also quite important). Looking at the entire film, there are many descriptions of Lin Zexu's personal activities in the first half, but he appears too little on the screen in the second half (especially near the end), which is disproportionate in comparison. In fact, Lin Zexu was still quite active after being dismissed, and his inner heart was also extremely depressed. When he boarded the road of exile and was about to leave Yumen Pass, he sent a poem full of complaints to Deng Tingzhen (Deng had arrived in Yili first) saying: "If the Central Plains can eliminate the weapons of war, what does it matter if the two old men grow old guarding the border." However, the creators of the film seem to be too stingy with the space for this part, otherwise the image of Lin Zexu this character will be more full.

There is also a small opinion, Comrade Zhao Dan's individual actions are slightly "rough", such as the inspection in front of the battery and the rush to say goodbye to Deng Tingzhen, some of the acting is close to the appearance of a martial artist in Peking opera, the "drama" flavor is heavier, and it does not conform to the identity of Lin Zexu, a senior civil official who came from a Jinshi and Hanlin background.

Regarding Yu Kun, it is quite successful in terms of the creation of dramatic characters and the exposure of the baseness and darkness of the reactionary ruling class. Due to the appearance of Yu Kun, the audience can more deeply understand the difficulty of Lin Zexu's situation and the firmness of his will. It should be believed that this artistic fictional effect is very good and reasonable. But from the perspective of historical authenticity, it always makes people feel inappropriate. Judging from Lin Zexu's diary, Yu Kun should be one of the members of the leadership group of the opium prohibition movement such as Lin, Deng, Guan, and Yi (Liang). They were very close to each other, and they discussed important matters with each other, and even entrusted private matters to each other. Deng Tingzhen "wrote the Canglang Pavilion farewell picture for Yu Hou'an (Kun), the commissioner" praising him "holding hands to know your virtue, seeing your magnanimity, coming here to manage the market, sorting out the submerged." Liang Tingnan's "Records of the Cantonese Atmosphere" has a lot of criticism of general traitorous officials, but there is not a word of sarcasm for Yu Kun. Judging from the existing historical materials, even if Yu Kun is not the most effective supporter of the opium prohibition movement, at least he is not as actively opposed to and undermined the opium prohibition movement as in the film. As an aside, Yu Kun resigned from his post shortly after Lin Zexu stepped down due to his father's death, and the relationship between the two was still very harmonious afterwards. Lin Zexu had a very strong personality. He often openly expressed his dissatisfaction with traitors such as Qishan, or at least perfunctorily treated them with extreme coldness, but there was no similar expression for Yu Kun.

Why defend Yu Kun for a few words? We have no intention of reversing the case for Yu Kun, because he is not a very important person. However, the film's treatment of Yu Kun is bound to easily give people the illusion that the Manchu officials at that time were all traitors. In fact, Yi Liang, the governor of Guangdong at the time, and Yu Kun, the customs supervisor, rarely showed national boundaries between Lin and Deng, and they worked together to resist foreign aggression, and they were all people who contributed to the Opium War. If the film affirms them, wouldn't it be more in line with historical truth? So, who should be used as the villain among the Guangdong officials? If Han Zhaoqing alone is not enough, you might as well artistically process the Guangzhou general at the time and use him to replace Yu Kun this role, which seems to be fairer and more reasonable. We think that if the Guangzhou general Dekjinbu, deputy general Yixiang, and Yinglong and others are written as villains, historians will certainly not have any objections.

But in any case, this film is very successful. A line in Lin Zexu's poem to Guan Tianpei is "Frost-defying flowers bloom on Lingnan branches", which is very thought-provoking. The "Lin Zexu" staged in the autumn of 1959 is also a frost-defying and beautiful flower, spraying out the strong fragrance of the Lingnan national integrity of more than 100 years ago, and also pouring out the sweet fragrance of the era flowers that are refreshing to the heart. The successful production of this film is one of the marks of the Great Leap Forward in the new Chinese film industry under the leadership of the Party. It makes us believe that the film industry is fully capable of producing more and better historical and biographical films to educate the broad masses of the people in patriotism and improve class consciousness. Let the right-wing gentlemen also come and appreciate the beautiful scenery of a hundred flowers blooming in the film garden, and their minds may become a little clearer.

    “傲霜花艳岭南枝”
    ——评历史故事片“林则徐”
    武昌华中师范学院  章开沅
    1843年的秋天，由于禁烟被清朝统治者遣戍的林则徐羁留在新疆。天山明月，寒更刁斗，白草黄榆，旷野哀笳。家国身世之感在他心头翻腾起伏，不禁忧愤地喟吟：“岐路又岐空有感”，“青史凭谁定是非”（“送懈筠赐环东归”）的诗句。
    历史是最公正的审判官。在一百一十六年以后的今天，影片“林则徐”把中国近代史上这一段公案清清楚楚地断定了曲直是非。和外国资本主义侵略者相勾结、把中国变为半殖民地的反动统治者受到最严厉的谴责，坚决反抗外来侵略和民族败类的中国人民受到热情的歌颂，曾经积极抵御外侮、功勋卓著的林则徐、关天培等也受到应有的表彰。
    感谢影片的编、导、演，他们把中国近代史这光辉的第一页成功地搬上了银幕，向我们观众进行了深刻的爱国主义教育。
    如何处理鸦片战争这样的历史题材，这个问题确实不大容易解决。由于多年从事中国近代史的教学和研究工作，我特别亲切地体会到影片创作者所支付的功力之深。
    首先要碰到的一个重要课题，就是怎样突出历史的主流。毛主席说：“帝国主义和中国封建主义相结合，把中国变为半殖民地和殖民地的过程，也就是中国人民反抗帝国主义及其走狗的过程。从鸦片战争、太平天国运动……、义和团运动……都表现了中国人民不甘屈服于帝国主义及其走狗的顽强的反抗精神。”前一个过程是中国近代历史消极阴暗的一个方面，不是历史的主流；后一个过程是积极进步的一个方面，是历史的主流，也是我们所应当着重描述和讴歌的对象。影片“林则徐”正是通过鸦片战争这一段史实，“表现了中国人民不甘屈服于帝国主义及其走狗的顽强的反抗精神”。剧作者和导演对于枝蔓芜杂的史实加以细密的整理和大胆的剪裁，把故事的结局安排为平英团英雄的斗争场面，从而使得有声有色的禁烟运动和广东爱国军民的英勇斗争在影片中的地位鲜明地突出起来。对于这一段历史的反动消极方面，影片的创作者力求只作陪衬的描叙。譬如对于定海失陷以后清统治者在侵略军的武力恐吓下开始动摇屈服，银幕上首先出现节节进逼的英舰，随即转入道光皇帝张惶失措接受琦善等求降主张的几个镜头。寥寥数笔，就将与人民坚决抵抗路线相对立的反动投降路线的发展变化勾划得淋漓尽致。正是因为编导同志具有这样的好手笔，所以整个影片才能始终保持强烈饱满的战斗气氛和坚定奋发的乐观色彩，丝毫也没有因为描叙了历史的阴暗反动方面而破坏了影片的健康情调。
    像鸦片战争这样旧民主主义革命时期的民族战争，史实记载中有关人民斗争的部分非常简略而又零碎，这主要是由于当时文化事业掌握在地主阶级手中的缘故。为了弥补这个缺陷，必须把历史的真实与艺术的想像有机地结合起来，使简略而零星的有关人民斗争的事迹系统化和完整化。影片的编导出色地完成了这个任务。他们创造了邝东山、麦宽、阿宽嫂这样三个有血有肉的人民英雄形象，用他们的悲惨经历和反抗活动，把围洋馆、截颠地、攻英舰、平英团等人民反侵略斗争的许多场面，前后贯串起来；并且又通过他们同林则徐的几次接触（如渡船上的谈话、截颠地后的留字、虎门焚烟和炮台工地上的相遇以至林则徐被罢斥后的送匾等），把人民的强烈意愿和斗争力量对于统治阶级中一部分爱国人士的影响和推动作用，也交代得清清楚楚。这样就使得故事的梗概非常完整，增强了情节的戏剧性，全部影片显得一气呵成。
    邝东山、麦宽和阿宽嫂本来是历史上不曾有过的人物，但是他们却使观众觉得有真实感。这主要因为编导和演员在塑造这几个人物的形象时，是以对于历史真实的深刻研究作为基础，然后再进行艺术概括和加工的。这三个人不正是在鸦片战争期间反抗外来侵略最为积极坚决的渔民、但户和“机房仔”等劳动人民的代表么？在他们的身上强烈地迸射出劳动人民光彩夺目的精神火焰。然而他们又不是一般的劳动人民，他们是劳动人民中间的杰出的代表人物。邝东山的老练豪迈，麦宽的憨厚勇猛，阿宽嫂的热情爽直，都在观众的心目中留下较深刻的印象。细心的编导、演员也没有忘记全面地描绘在那个时代里劳动人民的精神面貌，玄帝庙的敬神、给林则徐送匾等几个镜头，使观众清楚地了解当时人民还没有完全从封建思想的统治下解放出来。这与广东义民斥告英夷说帖等史料互相印证，也是切合当时实际的。
    影片通过邝东山等的传奇性故事和几个大规模的群众斗争场面，深刻地说明了反对鸦片贸易、反对武装侵略是完全符合人民意愿和得到工农群众有力支持的；如果说，林则徐曾经在一段期间内立下了震惊中外的功勋，那也主要是由于他在某种程度上看到了可用的民心，依靠了雄厚的民力。影片以形象的艺术语言解释了马克思列宁主义关于劳动人民是历史的主人的伟大真理。
    影片对于“林则徐”这个人物的塑造特别成功。如果你仔细查阅一下“林则徐日记”、“云左山房诗钞”、“信及录”、“夷氛闻记”和有关他的传记等等材料，你将发现影片上林则徐从思想品质、性格作风、生活习惯一直到外貌的造形，都是那么近似当时的林则徐。每一个观众在离开电影院时，长久不能忘记这样一个爱国爱民、精明干练、性情刚烈、感情丰富的英武形象。不能不说，这又是历史的真实与艺术的想像的精妙结晶。
    影片正确地处理了林则徐的忠君与爱国之间的深刻矛盾。在强烈的爱国心支配下，他在一定程度上运用了人民的力量，在反侵略斗争中造就了辉煌的功业，因而也就受到当时人民的支持和爱戴。但是，他毕竟到死还是清王朝的“林文忠公”，与人民始终保持着不可逾越的界线；人民勇敢而坚定地走着自己的反抗道路，他却只有服从自己所效忠的道光皇帝，也正是这个皇帝，最后与投降派结合起来，彻底破坏了林则徐的事业。林则徐的志向和行为与他所处在的那个阶级环境发生了强烈的冲突，这不能不在这个热情刚毅的人物的内心激起深刻的怨愤；然而怨愤是藏在心底的，影片通过不多几个镜头，如在琦善面前接旨时的眼神，被摘去顶戴时的面部表情，闭门养疴时桌上摆着的“离骚”等，如实地表现了他那有节制的不满心情。在影片将要结束时，银幕上出现了这样鲜明的对照：一方面是平英团奋勇击败英国侵略军，预示着英雄壮烈、如火如荼的人民反抗斗争正在不断蓬勃发展；一方面是林则徐寂寞而感伤地走上戍途，孤独地咀嚼着家国身世的悲痛遭遇。也许可以说这部传记片是悲剧罢？林则徐的伟大事业不是葬送在本身不可克服的深刻矛盾中么？然而影片决没有仅限于激发观众对于林则徐个人命运的同情，而更多地是引导观众看见人民斗争的雄伟力量和光明远景。影片正因此而散发出思想的光辉和艺术的魅力。
    不能不特别提到主演赵丹同志，他真实、深刻地创造了历史人物林则徐的形象。当面痛斥义律、庄严地申明禁烟决心时的正气凛然，痛恨卖国官吏、盛怒之下打破茶杯之后克制情感激动的努力，与政敌周旋时的软中有硬、机警老练，送别邓廷桢时的久久怅望孤帆云天，接受群众赠送匾额礼物时的感激奋发，……处处都恰如其分地以一个具有高度正义感、丰富的政治阅历、深厚的文化修养、性情刚直坚毅而又颇知含蓄收敛的爱国士大夫的姿态出现在观众的眼前。可以看得出来，赵丹同志在动作和道白方面还吸收了中国传统戏曲程式中的某些有益部分。那见驾时的跪拜、斟酒时的手势以至摘下顶带时的全身动作，都显得非常干净利落，线条健劲而又潇洒。在与琦善激烈争执、企图最后挽救危局而终遭摈斥时，林则徐强抑住满腔怒气，悲愤地说：“林某上不负皇上社稷，下不负黎民百姓，……”。那语言简直是一个字一个字地迸发出来的，铿然作金石之声。整个说来，影片中的对白是不算多的，人物的内心活动主要还是通过情节的发展、脸色、眼神、一举手、一投足等表现出来的。这标志着中国电影的编、导、表演技术已经进入了一个新的阶段。
    扮演反面人物的几个演员也有出色的表演。道光皇帝的虚骄而又怯懦、穆璋阿的阴险卑劣、琦善的贪婪专横、伍绍荣的奴颜婢膝、以至义律的奸诈狠毒……都既揭示了他们的反动阶级本质和社会身分，同时也凸出了各自的独特性格，尽管有的人在银幕上出现的机会不多，却给观众留下了鲜明的印象。
    影片在故事编排和人物塑造方面确实有很多是虚拟的，甚至有些是与史事不全吻合的，但是所有这些都能使观众相信其真实性，仿佛都是实际发生过的事情一样。为什么会达到这样的艺术效果呢？这就是因为虚拟的和加工的部分是以历史的真实性和必然性作为基础的。像邝东山这样传奇性的英雄，在史书上虽然没有记载，但在当时却是完全可能存在的，浙江沿海的黑水党不就是明证么？麦宽这个人物的经历和事迹虽是虚拟的，但在当时广东人民中间不正是存在着千千万万个类似麦宽的人物么？在麦宽的身上我们难道看不出三元里农民英雄韦绍光等人的威武形象么？以真实性作为基础而又不要过分拘束于它的限制，在历史的必然性和可能性的天地里，艺术构思的神骏有着广阔的原野可供驰骋。不是总有人过分强调创作历史剧的困难么？请看看“林则徐”罢，它将雄辩地表明：我国悠久、丰富、壮丽的历史素材正在向艺术家们伸出热烈欢迎的双手。
    尊重历史真实与客观主义和自然主义决不能混同起来。影片“林则徐”的好处不仅在于具有深厚的历史真实性的基础，而更重要的是强烈地吹拂着我们当前伟大的时代精神。因为历史虽然是过去的事，但编导、演员和观众却是现在的人；作品的风格必须与我们国家今天的社会主义建设大跃进气氛相适应。我特别喜爱“林则徐”，正是因为它一扫旧的中国历史阴暗、悲惨、屈辱、消极等灰色情调，而充满了民族自信、坚定、刚毅、英勇、乐观等适合于当前时代精神的强烈色彩。这部影片的内容结构、表演技术、情绪起伏、发展节奏以至布景、音响、光线、彩色都是紧凑的、强烈的、雄伟的、鲜明的。特别是在国庆十周年举国欢腾的时刻，看到这部电影，真是分外意气振奋，干劲倍增。应该认为，影片的创作者（包括所有工作人员的集体劳动和集体智慧）扣紧了时代的脉膊，具有和人民同呼吸共命运的思想感情，才能使这部影片具有可贵的时代风貌。
    这部影片也有几处似乎需要改进的地方，下面想提出一些零星的建议。
    反映鸦片贸易对劳动人民的严重损害好像过于疏略一些，只有脚夫搬运沉重的烟箱和盲妹的丈夫匆匆溜进破烂阴暗的烟馆等二三个镜头，这样便不能更有力地说明人民群众何以对鸦片贸易具有那样深沉的仇恨。同样，对侵略者残害人民的暴行也缺乏应有的描述，削弱了群众“人人持刀痛杀”侵略者的情感基础。此外，群众的衣着、住处似乎都显得略为“富裕”一些，不大像是正在受着封建势力的残酷压榨。电影创作者可能顾虑如实地描绘这些阴暗场面会破坏整个影片的健康气氛，但我觉得少数陪衬的镜头决不至于损害整个影片的基调，相反地还会使之更加鲜明强烈。作为教育工作者，我深切感到，在今天让人民、特别是青年一代，经常温习一下半殖民地的历史灾难还是很有益处的，这将使我们更加热爱祖国、热爱共产党和社会主义，同时增强对于帝国主义及其走狗的痛恨和警惕性。
    有些细节的描述似乎略嫌琐碎一些，如林邓私访、虎门焚烟等，假若再精练一些，效果可能还要好些。但在清王朝君臣议论禁烟问题之前如果能插入1838年12月12日广州人民在鸦片贩子住处前举行的万人大示威场面（把时间顺序稍为移动一下），这样或者可以使人民斗争主流的地位更加突出一些。本来抵抗派的受命和禁烟运动的实现，就是以人民的强烈意愿和英勇斗争为前提的，林则徐不是早就说过：“察看舆情，并非不可挽救”么？
    作为传记片，对主人翁林则徐的描写似乎还不够。编导所刻划的只是林则徐爱国御侮这个方面（自然是主要的方面），却漏掉了开明进步、愿意向资本主义西方学习的另一方面（虽然不是主要的，但也是颇为重要的方面）。从整个影片来看，前半部林则徐的个人活动描写很多，后半部则在银幕上出现得过少（特别是在快结尾时），相形之下，不大均衡。其实林则徐在被罢斥后活动还是相当多的，内心也是极端苦闷的。在登上戍途将出玉门关时，他牢骚满腹地寄诗给邓廷桢（邓已先至伊犁）说：“中原果得销金革，两叟何妨老戍边。”可是影片的创作者对于这一部分的刻划似乎过于吝啬了一些篇幅，否则林则徐这个人物的形象将会更加丰满一些。
    还有个小意见，赵丹同志的个别动作略嫌“粗”了一些，譬如炮台前的视察和送别邓廷桢的急行等，有的演技近乎京剧中武生的亮相，“戏”味儿重了一些，不大符合林则徐这样一个进士翰林出身高级文职官员的身分。
    关于豫坤，作为戏剧人物的创造和揭露反动统治阶级的卑污黑暗而言，是相当成功的。由于豫坤的出现，才使观众更加深切体会到林则徐处境的困难和意志的坚定。应该认为，这种艺术上的虚构效果很好，也是合乎情理的。可是从历史真实性角度看来，总使人觉得不大妥当。从林则徐日记看来，豫坤应当是林、邓、关、怡（良）等禁烟运动领导集团成员之一，彼此过从甚密，有要事则互相商议，甚至连私事也相委托。邓廷桢“为豫厚庵（坤）榷使题沧浪亭送别图”曾赞扬他“握手知君贤，汪洋见叔度，……兹来筦市舶，厘剔起沉涸。”梁亭枬的“粤氛闻记”对一般卖国官员颇多微词，可是却没有一句话微讽豫坤。从现有史料看来，豫坤即令不是禁烟运动最得力的支持者，至少也决不像在影片上那样积极反对和破坏禁烟运动。附带说一句，林则徐下台不久，豫坤也就丁父忧离职了，而且以后两人的关系仍然是很融洽的。林则徐个性很强，他对卖国贼如琦善等往往公开表示不满，至少是用极端冷淡的态度来敷衍，可是对豫坤却不见有任何类似表现。
    为什么要为豫坤辩护两句呢？我们倒无意为豫坤翻案，因为他并不是一个十分重要的人物。可是影片对豫坤这样的处理不免容易使人产生一种错觉，好像当时的满族官员都是卖国的。其实当时广东巡抚怡良和海关监督豫坤，与林邓之间很少表现出民族界线，同心协力，共御外侮，都是在鸦片战争中有贡献的人物。如果影片中对他们有所肯定，不是更加符合历史真实一些吗？那么，用谁来当作广东官员中的反面人物呢？韩肇庆一个人如果不够，不妨对当时的广州将军进行一番艺术加工，以他来代替豫坤这一角，这样似乎要公平合理一些。我们想，如果把广州将军德克金布、副都统奕湘、英隆之流写成反面人物，历史学家一定不会有什么意见。
    但是无论如何，这部影片是非常成功的。林则徐赠关天培诗中有一句是“傲霜花艳岭南枝”，非常耐人寻味。在1959年秋天上演的“林则徐”也是一枝傲霜艳花，喷发出浓烈的百余年前岭南民族气节的芬芳，也倾吐着沁人心肺的时代鲜花的甜美香味。这部影片的摄制成功，是在党领导下的新中国电影事业大跃进的标记之一，它使我们相信电影界已经完全有可能制作更多更好的历史、传记片，来向广大人民进行爱国主义和提高阶级觉悟的教育。让姓右的先生们也来领略领略电影园地中百花盛开的美景吧，他们的头脑也许会变得稍微清醒一些。
