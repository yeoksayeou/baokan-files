    Going Back on One's Word for Self-Enrichment
    Yuan Shuipai
    Six months ago, he bragged, six months later, the situation remains the same. The unemployed are still unemployed, and he has to admit he was bluffing. Capitalism is a disaster, the Labor Secretary is a scapegoat. The "free world" is exposed, stumbling on the steps. The real workers are hungry, while the "labor" minister plays tricks. The unemployed suffer, the capitalists eat cake!
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 12th: U.S. Labor Secretary Mitchell made a fool of himself in public on the 11th, eating a hat given to him by a union in front of the Labor Department's door.
    Mitchell said at the hat-eating ceremony that in October of this year, the number of employed people in the United States was 66.8 million, and the number of unemployed people was 3.27 million, which means he lost his bet.
    In April of this year, Mitchell boasted that he guaranteed that the number of employed people in the United States would rise to 67 million in October this year, and the number of unemployed people would drop to less than 3 million. He also bet that if he was wrong, he would be willing to eat a hat.
    A large crowd gathered to watch Mitchell eat this cake-made hat. The hat-eating ceremony will be broadcast by a television company.

    食言自肥
    袁水拍
    半年前夸下海口，半年后情况依旧，失业的还是失业，只好承认是吹牛。资本主义是祸殃，劳工部长做替罪羊，“自由世界”活现形，台阶前面出洋相。真正的劳工饿肚皮，当部长的“劳工”玩把戏，失业的苦恼，资本家吃糕！
    新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国劳工部长密歇尔11日当众出丑，他在劳工部的大门前吞食了工会送给他的一顶帽子。
    密歇尔在举行吃帽子仪式时说，在今年10月份，美国就业人数是六千六百八十万人，失业人数是三百二十七万人，这就是说他赌输了。
    在今年4月间，密歇尔曾经吹牛说，他保证美国就业人数今年10月将上升到六千七百万人，失业人数下降到不到三百万人。他并且打赌，如果他估计错了，他情愿吃一顶帽子。
    在密歇尔吃这顶由蛋糕做的帽子时，一大群人围着看。吃帽子的仪式将由电视公司广播。
