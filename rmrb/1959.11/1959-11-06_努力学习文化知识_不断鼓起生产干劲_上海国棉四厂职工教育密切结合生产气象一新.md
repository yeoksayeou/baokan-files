    Strive to Learn Cultural Knowledge
    Constantly Boost Production Enthusiasm
    Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 4's Employee Education Closely Integrates with Production, Creating a New Atmosphere
    (Reported by this newspaper) How can employee spare-time education continue to leap forward alongside the current excellent production situation? This requires constantly combating right-leaning tendencies and boosting enthusiasm in employee spare-time education work, adhering to the principle of "integrating with production, unified arrangements, teaching according to aptitude, and flexible and diverse methods." The employee spare-time school of Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 4 has made achievements in this regard.
    After the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, the teachers of this employee spare-time school and the factory's trade union and Communist Youth League cadres quickly boosted their enthusiasm, made proper arrangements for study time according to the current tense production situation, strengthened political and ideological education and production technology education, and included spare-time education work in the production work plan. In the past half month or so, the factory has been in the midst of a production upsurge, and the attendance rate of workers in study has not only not decreased due to the tension of production, but has gradually increased, from 62.7% to the current 80%. They are also confidently striving to become an advanced unit in the Jiangning District in terms of literacy, study attendance rate, and examination pass rate.
    Before National Day, after the factory studied the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a vigorous mass movement to vigorously increase production and practice economy was launched, and the workers投入 (tóurù - threw themselves) into a new upsurge of production. This was the time when the new academic year of the spare-time school began, and the attendance rate of workers in study was very low, only reaching about 60%. Some people believed that this was an unavoidable "routine" and that improving the attendance rate of workers in study could only be waited for later. Later, after discussion and in-depth investigation and visits to the workshops, it was learned that although the current production tasks were heavy, it was not that workers did not want to study, but that they needed cultural and technical knowledge in technological innovation; in addition, workers were busy, but it was not that they had no time to study culture at all, but that they needed to flexibly grasp study time. The teachers found that the main reason for the low attendance rate of workers in study was that their work had not yet fully adapted to the needs of the production upsurge. Taking out the school-running principles determined at this year's National Conference on Employee Education in Industrial and Mining Enterprises for another review, "integrating with production, unified arrangements, teaching according to aptitude, and flexible and diverse methods" was precisely the way to solve their current problems. Moreover, the factory's production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. It had been rated as an "advanced factory" in the city's cotton textile industry in the first half of the year, and had made a big leap forward in the third quarter. The unit output of the 20-count sub-brand yarn and the unit output of the 32-count yarn spun by the factory, as well as the superior evenness, all ranked first in the city. The teachers were confident and determined to implement the school-running principles, taking advantage of the excellent production situation to work hard.
    The textbooks currently used in the school are the new textbooks compiled by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau this year. The content of the lessons is closely related to production practice. In order to further cooperate with the current situation and combine with the actual production of the factory, the teachers compiled supplementary teaching materials for the Chinese language textbook according to the factory's fourth-quarter production plan, mobilized factory technicians and workers to collect formulas and calculations that need to be solved in the current workshop production, and used them as exercises and lecture examples for the arithmetic textbook. At the same time, they also made publicity about the domestic and international situation and major events in the factory for five minutes before the first lesson every day. For example, in the fourth quarter, their factory proposed the goal of continuing to win the city's first place in the unit output of four types of yarns: 20-count warp yarn, weft yarn, sales yarn, and 32-count weft yarn. However, in mid-October, two types of cotton yarn were caught up and surpassed by two other factories. The teachers quickly revealed this news in the pre-class publicity in various classrooms, and then talked about the enthusiasm of Shanghai's industrial departments in striving to overfulfill the city's industrial production plan ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule, which left a deep impression on the workers and aroused their great interest in cultural lessons. In less than two or three days, they regained the first place in the unit output of the two types of cotton yarn.
    In terms of technical courses, workers have been attending classes at a relatively high rate because they have been studying in the workshop in conjunction with key production issues. Now, in order to better adapt to the requirements of the production leap forward, the technical course teaching and research group has summarized the technology of solving the problem of fuzzing in the weaving department and the design problem of building a constant temperature and humidity room with local equipment, and is preparing to conduct teaching for workers and cadres every two weeks respectively, so that everyone can discuss it collectively to further improve the technical level of employees.
    Regarding study time, in addition to the fixed class time every week, the teachers also increase the tutoring time. Workers can come and make up lessons whenever they have free time. Sometimes the teachers even go to the workshop to tutor the workers. There are more than a dozen cooks in the kitchen, because their working hours conflict with the factory's fixed study time, they have not participated in cultural studies. When the teachers learned about this situation, they added a special class for them, so these dozen cooks are now also enrolled.
    The employee spare-time school actively serves politics and production, and has received great attention and support from the factory's Party committee and administration. They have put forward more advanced goals, which have been incorporated into the factory's fourth-quarter production work plan. (Lu Zuohua)

    努力学习文化知识
    不断鼓起生产干劲
    上海国棉四厂职工教育密切结合生产气象一新
    本报讯　在目前生产大好形势中，职工业余教育怎样能跟着生产高潮继续跃进？这就是在职工业余教育工作中要经常反右倾、鼓干劲，坚持“结合生产、统一安排、因材施教、灵活多样”的办学原则。上海国棉四厂职工业余学校在这方面已做出成绩。
    这所职工业余学校的教师和全厂的工会、共青团干部在党的八中全会决议公布以后，很快鼓起干劲，按照目前紧张的生产情况，妥善安排学习时间，加强政治思想教育和生产技术教育，并且把业余教育工作列入了生产工作计划。近半个多月来，工厂正处在生产高潮之中，工人的学习出勤率不但没有因生产紧张而下降，反而逐步提高，从62.7％上升到目前80％。他们并且满怀信心地争取在扫盲、学习出勤率和考试及格率方面成为江宁区的先进单位。
    国庆节前，工厂学习党的八届八中全会文件以后，掀起了轰轰烈烈的厉行增产节约的群众运动，工人都投入了生产的新高潮。这时正是业余学校新学年开学的时候，工人学习出勤率很低，只达到60％左右。有人认为这是无法避免的“常规”，要提高工人学习出勤率只能等待以后再说。后来经过讨论，并且深入车间调查访问，了解到当前生产任务是繁重，但并不是工人就不要学习，而在搞技术革新中，他们很需要文化和技术知识；另外工人是忙，但并不是一点也没有时间学习文化，只是需要灵活掌握学习时间。教师们发现工人学习出勤率低的主要原因，是他们的工作还没有完全适应生产高潮的需要。再把今年全国工矿企业职工教育工作会议确定的办学原则拿出来一温习，“结合生产、统一安排、因材施教，灵活多样”，正是解决他们当前问题的途径。而且全厂生产干劲空前高涨，上半年已被评为全市棉纺织业的“先进厂”，第三季度来又跃进了一大步，该厂纺制的二十支副牌纱单位产量和三十二支纱的单位产量、优级条干都跃居全市第一。教师们都有信心，坚决执行办学原则，乘生产大好形势，大干一番。
    现在学校里采用的教材都是上海市教育局今年编撰的新教材，课文内容密切联系生产实际，为了更进一步配合当前形势和结合本厂生产实际，于是教师们按照工厂的第四季度生产计划编写了语文课本的补充教材，发动工厂技术人员和工人，收集目前车间生产中需要解决的算式和算题，作为算术课本的习题和讲课的例题。同时他们还在每天第一课的课前作五分钟国内外形势和厂内大事的宣传。例如第四季度他们工厂提出目标：继续夺取二十支经纱、纬纱、售纱和三十二支纬纱等四种纱支单位产量的全市第一。可是在10月中旬，有两种棉纱被别的两家工厂赶上超过了。教师们就在各个课堂的课前宣传中迅速地透露这个消息，并且接着讲了上海各工业部门为提前十天到十五天超额完成全市工业生产计划而斗争的干劲，给工人们印象很深，也引起他们对文化课的很大兴趣，不到两三天，就夺回了两种棉纱单位产量的第一名。
    在技术课方面，由于一直在车间结合生产关键进行学习，工人学习出勤率比较高。现在为了更能适应生产跃进的要求，技术课教研组已总结了织部解决浆纱起毛问题的技术，用土设备建成恒温恒湿室的设计问题等，准备每两周分别向工人、干部进行一次教学，由大家集体讨论，进一步提高职工的技术水平。
    对于学习时间，除了每周固定的上课时间以外，教师们还增加补课时间，工人什么时候有空闲时间，都可以随到随补，有时教师还下车间去给工人补课。厨房有十多个炊事员，因为他们的工作时间正同工厂固定的学习时间冲突，一直没有参加文化学习，教师们知道了这个情况，为他们增设了特别课，因此这十多个炊事员现在也都入学了。
    职工业余学校积极地为政治、为生产服务，受到工厂党委和行政很大的重视和支持，他们提出了更先进的目标，已被订入全厂第四季度生产工作计划中。　　　　　（陆左华）
