    Prevent Diseases and Ensure Continued Leap Forward in Production
    Beijing Holds Meeting of Patriotic Health Activist Representatives

    The Beijing Patriotic Health Activist and Medical Worker Representative Conference held today proposed to "carry out a patriotic health campaign centered on disease prevention to ensure the continued leap forward on the capital's industrial and agricultural production fronts."
    Since the beginning of winter, the people of the capital have made great achievements in the rat extermination campaign. The Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, in accordance with the Party's principle of prevention first, analyzed the patterns of disease occurrence this winter and next spring and made arrangements for disease prevention work: requiring all regions and units, under the leadership of the Party, with close cooperation between cadres, medical personnel, and the masses, to strengthen the prevention of potentially occurring infectious hepatitis, influenza, chronic dysentery, measles, and other diseases as early as possible. All regions and units should determine key areas for disease prevention and jointly prevent winter diseases. The Capital Patriotic Health Campaign Committee also required all districts and systems to improve grassroots disease prevention organizations, and to conscientiously implement the "four earlies" (early detection, early reporting, early isolation, early treatment) in disease prevention measures.
    Yan Yi, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, called on medical workers at the meeting to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, do a good job in disease prevention, ensure the health of the people, and promote the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The patriotic health activists and medical workers attending the meeting unanimously and enthusiastically responded to this call.
