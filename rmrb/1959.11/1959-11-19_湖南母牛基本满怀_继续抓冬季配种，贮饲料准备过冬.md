Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 17th: The suitable-aged mother cows in Hunan Province are basically all pregnant. Having achieved victory in cattle mating, people's communes in various regions are now vigorously focusing on the winter care and maintenance of draught cattle, preparing conditions for continued leaps forward in agricultural production next year. Currently, 87% of the suitable-aged mother cows in Hunan Province have been mated and are pregnant, with the pregnancy rate exceeding 90% in five special districts, including Hengyang and Xiangtan. Thanks to good care, draught cattle with eight or nine tenths of their ideal weight account for more than 90% of the total number of draught cattle in the province.

Recently, while continuing to vigorously carry out winter mating work, various regions have been universally building and renovating cattle pens, actively storing grass and preparing materials to protect and care for draught cattle through the winter. The Chen County Special District has now built and renovated more than 35,000 cattle pens, and stored more than 13 million catties of fodder and more than 10 million catties of concentrated feed.

Various regions are also universally going up the mountains to collect herbal medicines in preparation for preventing and treating draught cattle epidemics. The province has mobilized and organized more than 40,000 professional veterinarians and epidemic prevention personnel to go up the mountains to dig up herbal medicines. According to statistics from six counties, including Guiyang and Yongxing, more than 920,000 catties of herbal medicines have already been dug up.

In the work of protecting and caring for draught cattle through the winter, some communes and brigades have established cattle protection committees or groups, established systems, conducted regular inspections and evaluations, and promoted the "eight-fixed" feeding and management responsibility system, which has improved the enthusiasm of the broad masses of feeders in raising and protecting draught cattle well.

    继续抓冬季配种，贮饲料准备过冬
    新华社长沙17日电　湖南省适龄母牛基本满怀。各地人民公社在取得耕牛配种胜利的基础上，正大抓耕牛过冬护养工作，为明年农业生产继续跃进准备条件。现在，湖南省适龄母牛已有87％配种满怀，衡阳、湘潭等五个专区母牛满怀率达90％以上。由于养护得好，有八、九成膘的耕牛占全省耕牛总数的90％以上。
    最近各地在继续大力开展冬季配种工作的同时，普遍搭盖和整修牛栏，积极贮草备料，护养耕牛过冬。郴县专区现在已新建和整修牛栏三万五千多个，贮备饲草一千三百多万斤，精料一千多万斤。
    各地还普遍上山采集草药，准备防治耕牛疫病。全省动员组织上山挖草药的专业兽医和防疫员已达四万多人。据桂阳、永兴等六个县的统计，已挖草药九十二万多斤。
    在护养耕牛过冬工作中，有的公社、大队成立了护牛委员会或小组，订立制度，定期检查评比，推行“八定”饲养管理责任制，提高了广大饲养员养好护好耕牛的积极性。
