The Dadeng Island is the closest point to Jinmen on the entire Fujian front. Having experienced long years of battle, Dadeng Island has become a heroic island. On this island, there is a basement with a sign reading "Dadeng Postal Branch." This is the nerve center connecting the heroic island to the mainland, and also the communication station for the heroic people to communicate with their loved ones.

The Dadeng Postal Branch was established in 1954. For more than five years, it has been tirelessly transmitting news of victory to all parts of the country, and sending the entrustment, expectations, and greetings of the people across the country to the heroes on the island. Millions of letters, newspapers, remittances, and packages have been delivered through the hands of the postal workers here to the trenches of the People's Liberation Army, to the offices of Party and government organs, and to the homes of peasant brothers. Countless phone calls have been connected through the hands of the postal workers here to the headquarters of the PLA stationed on Dadeng Island, to the Party Committee, and to the People's Commune. Hundreds of pounds of propaganda materials for the enemy have also been sent again and again through the hands of the postal workers here to the political department of the PLA stationed on Dadeng Island, and then loaded onto kites to be flown to Jinmen Island with the wind, or loaded onto special shells to be launched to Jinmen Island... The staff of the Dadeng Postal Branch deeply realize the glory of their mission and the importance of their responsibility. The three of them – the branch director, the lineman, and the clerk – are united as one, working diligently and conscientiously day and night for five years, bravely and tenaciously persisting in postal and telecommunications work. No matter the circumstances, they are able to outwit and outmaneuver the enemy, ensuring smooth postal communications and guaranteeing the close connection between the People's Liberation Army and the people of the whole country at all times. They have never leaked secrets or had any communication accidents. They have excellently completed and continue to complete the communication tasks on the front line of coastal defense, and actively serve the central work of the Party in various periods, thus constantly gaining more and more praise from the Party committee and the military and civilians on the island.

Now, let's take a look at the representative of this branch!

Even if the enemy is rampant, the people's news will never be cut off

Comrade Guo Shixing is a man in his forties of medium build. Before liberation, he was a "runner" for the Kuomintang post office, living a life worse than that of an animal all year round. Now, he is a glorious Communist Party member, the director of the Dadeng Postal Branch, and a representative to the National Advanced Collective and Advanced Producer Representative Conference for Industry, Transportation, Construction, Finance, and Trade. A respected hero! In him, we can see the glorious image of the postal workers on Dadeng Island – the communication soldiers of the front line.

On August 23 last year, our heroic People's Liberation Army launched a punitive strike against the enemy on Jinmen Island. A very fierce artillery battle began, and the roaring cannons shook the earth. The telephone line was cut by enemy shells. What to do? Comrade Guo Shixing said: "No matter how rampant the enemy is, we must not let communications be interrupted!" Under the leadership of the district committee secretary, Guo Shixing and lineman Lin Dawei led the militia to immediately set off in two teams to repair the line. In front were gas bombs fired by the enemy. They put the wet towels they had prepared over their noses, bypassed the poisonous gas bomb zone, and advanced on the still smoking ground and the still hot bomb craters. Shrapnel pierced their feet, and fresh blood dripped on the ground. But they didn't care about any of this. At this time, what was on their minds was how to restore the line one second earlier. They ran, lay down, and crawled, creeping forward step by step, passing through the enemy's fire net, connecting the telephone line, and finally quickly restoring communication, enabling the People's Liberation Army to severely strike the enemy.

Over the past few years, Guo Shixing and his close comrades-in-arms have had to walk from the postal branch to the pier three miles away every day to pick up and deliver mail. One day, the enemy's artillery fire was incessant all day long, and the mainland mail had not been delivered by noon. They waited anxiously, like waiting for a difficult childbirth. When the artillery fire subsided slightly, Guo Shixing ran to the pier alone and found a small sailboat to sail towards the canal. At that time, the canal pier was constantly subjected to enemy shelling. As a front-line communication vanguard, Guo Shixing, relying on his own wisdom and courage, and relying on a fiery heart, rushed to the pier and transported more than one hundred kilograms of mail and newspapers back to Dadeng. It was already 11 o'clock at night. Lighting was prohibited on the front line, the night was pitch black, and people were exhausted. Rest? No! Comrade Guo Shixing cheered up, went out in the dark, and delivered all the letters and newspapers to the organs, troops, and other units. In order to allow the PLA comrades to see the Party's newspapers every day, and to receive letters from their loved ones as early as possible, he often disregarded his own fatigue and immediately went out to deliver the mail after picking it up. He braved the artillery fire and ran happily through countless winding traffic trenches, from this position to that position. One day, he walked with a brisk pace to a familiar intersection as usual, happily recalling the happy scene when the soldiers in the trenches were scrambling to read the letters of condolences he had just delivered, when suddenly a series of whistling shells came. Experience told him that the shells were about to explode around him. Guo Shixing, he had long sworn an oath: the head can be broken, the blood can flow, but the people's news must never be extinguished. With a sharp turn, he fell on the mailbag, using his body to protect the news from hundreds or thousands of miles away. Sure enough, a shell exploded fifty meters away from him, and shrapnel whizzed past him. He stood up, patted the dirt off his body, and was about to step forward when a series of whistling shells tore through the sky again. He ran and jumped towards the traffic trench. Just at this moment, a shell landed outside their dugout. The soldiers said affectionately and reproachfully: "Old Guo! Don't take too much risk. Sit down! Wait for the artillery fire to ease before you go!"

Braving Typhoons to Repair Lines and Forming Friendship with the Military and Civilians

This year, it was August 23 again. At night, a category 12 typhoon struck Dadeng Island fiercely, and the lines were severely damaged. At the same time, the enemy situation was tense, and the island was in a state of emergency preparedness. However, at this time, all six lines were destroyed by the typhoon! Guo Shixing clearly realized that repairing the lines at this time meant rescuing the lives and property of the people on the island, and there must be no delay. After obtaining instructions from the Party committee, he led Lin Dawei out to repair the lines. The wind was strong, the rain was heavy, the night was dark, and they couldn't use flashlights. They bent over and groped forward, wading through traffic trenches that were waist-deep, and climbing over salt fields that were submerged in water... In order to protect the telephone from the rain, they took off their raincoats and wrapped them around it layer by layer. When they needed to erect bamboo poles, they had no digging tools, so they dug with their hands. Their fingers were bleeding from digging the soil; the wet clothes stuck to their backs were icy cold. However, the glorious sense of responsibility of the people's communication soldiers strongly supported them. They overcame the raging wind and rain, and overcame the raging mountain torrents. Finally, they repaired all the broken lines, enabling the Party committee secretary and the troop commanders to direct the military and civilians in time to fight the typhoon and fight the enemy.

For the needs of the war, they never had any fixed business hours. As soon as the artillery fire stopped, soldiers and the people on the front line came to send letters, remit money, and subscribe to newspapers and magazines. Sometimes it was in the middle of the night, and sometimes it was just before dawn. They enthusiastically served the military and civilians on the island; they handled business whenever people came. The troops subscribed to many newspapers and magazines, almost all the newspapers and magazines from various provinces across the country. They weighed hundreds of pounds each time. Moreover, the troops had a high degree of mobility. Therefore, they often had to carry large bags of mail and newspapers from here to there, and sometimes they had to carry them back and transfer them to other places. Despite this, they were always responsible for delivering them to the end.

The Dadeng Postal Branch has a total of three people, who handle various businesses such as letters, registered mail, remittances, parcels, newspapers and magazines, and island telephones. They have all learned comprehensive business skills, and can operate, dispatch, switchboard, and repair lines. Now, they can even repair common faults of telephones and switchboards themselves. When new business comes, the three of them study together, learn together, and teach each other what they know. When a combat mission comes, one person stays at home to handle all the business, and two people go out to check the lines and repair them.

The staff of the Dadeng Postal Branch have forged a fighting friendship with the military and civilians on the island. They do everything possible to serve the soldiers and the masses of farmers, and they have also received enthusiastic help from the soldiers and farmers. For the victory of the war, they have been closely united as one with the military and civilians on the island in the flames of war.

    英雄岛上的英雄邮电局
    ——介绍福建前线的大嶝邮电支局
    大嶝岛是整个福建前线上最迫近金门的地方。经历过漫长的战斗岁月，大嶝岛已经成为英雄的岛。在这个岛上，有挂着“大嶝邮电支局”牌子的一间地下室，这就是英雄岛与祖国大陆保持联系的神经点，也是英雄人民与自己亲人沟通消息的通信站。
    大嶝邮电支局诞生于1954年。五年多以来，它日夜不停地把胜利的消息传播到全国各地，又把全国各地人民的付托、期望与慰问送给岛上的英雄。几百万份的信函、报刊、汇票、包裹通过这里邮电职工的双手送到人民解放军的战壕里，送到党政机关的办公室里，送到农民兄弟的家里；无数次的电话，通过这里邮电职工的双手接到驻大嶝岛解放军的指挥部，接到党委会，接到人民公社；几百斤的对敌宣传品也是一次又一次地通过这里邮电职工的双手送到驻大嶝岛解放军的政治部，再装上风筝随风飘到金门岛上或装上特别的炮弹发射到金门岛上去……大嶝邮电支局的职工们深深地认识到自己任务的光荣，责任的重大。他们三个人——支局长、线务员和营业员团结成一条心，拧成一股绳，五年如一日，勇敢顽强地、勤勤恳恳地坚持邮电通信工作，不论在任何情况下都能与敌人斗智斗勇，保证邮电畅通，保证人民解放军时时刻刻与全国人民的密切联系，从来不失密，不泄密，也没有发生任何通信事故。他们出色地完成了并继续完成着海防前线的通信任务，又积极地为党的各个时期的中心工作服务，因而，不断地获得党委和岛上军民越来越多的表扬。
    现在，让我们看一看这个支局的代表吧！
    那怕敌人再猖狂  人民音讯绝不断
    郭诗杏同志，一个四十来岁中等身材的人。解放前，他是国民党邮局的“跑差”，一年到头过着牛马不如的生活。现在，他是光荣的共产党员，大嶝邮电支局的支局长，全国工业、交通、基建、财贸先进集体、先进生产者代表会议的代表。一位受人尊敬的英雄啊！在他的身上，我们可以看到大嶝岛邮电职工——前沿人民通信兵的光辉形象。
    去年8月23日，我们英雄的解放军对金门岛上的敌人进行惩罚性的打击。非常猛烈的炮战开始了，隆隆的炮声震得大地发抖。电话线被敌人的炮弹打断了。怎么办呢？郭诗杏同志说：“无论敌人怎样猖狂，我们决不能让通讯中断！”在区委书记的领导下，郭诗杏和线务员林大伟率领民兵分成两队立即出发抢修。前面有敌人打来的瓦斯弹，他们就把早已准备好了的湿毛巾蒙上鼻子，绕过毒气弹地带，踏着还冒烟的土地、还烫脚的弹坑前进。弹片刺破了他们的脚，鲜血一滴一滴地流在地上。可是，他们全没顾上这些。这时盘旋在他们脑际的是如何争取早一秒钟把线路修复。他们跑着、卧倒着、爬行着，一步一步地匍匐前进，通过敌人的火力网，把电话线接起来，终于迅速地恢复了通讯，使人民解放军能够狠狠地打击敌人。
    几年来，郭诗杏和他的亲密战友，每天都要从邮电支局走到三里外的码头上接送邮件。一天，敌人炮火整天打个不停，大陆的邮件已过了中午还没有运来，他们像等待难产的婴儿一样焦急地等待着。当炮火稍稀的时候，郭诗杏就一个人跑到码头去，找了一只小帆船向运河驶去。当时运河码头不断地受到敌人炮弹的射击。作为前沿通信尖兵的郭诗杏，凭着自己的智慧和勇敢，凭着一颗火热的心，冲上码头，把一百多斤的邮件和报纸运回大嶝。这时已是深夜十一点了。前沿禁止打灯，夜是漆黑的，人是疲惫的。休息去吗？不！郭诗杏同志打起精神，摸黑出去，把机关、部队等单位的信函、报纸全部送完。为了让解放军同志每天都能够看到、而且尽可能早一点看到党的报纸、收到亲人的信件，他往往不顾自己的疲劳，在挑完邮件之后，立即出去投递。他冒着炮火，穿过无数弯曲的交通壕，从这个阵地到那个阵地，欢乐地奔跑着。一天，他像往常一样以轻快的步伐走到一个熟悉的岔路口，正乐滋滋地回忆着刚才战士们在壕沟里抢看自己送来的慰问信时的高兴情景，突然传来一阵嘘嘘的炮弹声。经验告诉他：炮弹马上就要在他的周围爆炸了。郭诗杏，他早已立下誓言：头可断，血可流，人民的音讯绝不可灭。一个急转身，他就倒伏在信袋上，用自己的身体保护这来自百里、千里外的音讯。果然，一颗炮弹就在他身旁五十米的地方爆炸了，弹片忽忽地从他身上掠过。他站起来，拍拍身上的泥土，刚要迈步向前走的时候，一连串嘘嘘的炮弹声又划破长空飞将过来，他连跑带跳地向交通壕冲过去。就在这个时候，一颗炮弹落在他们的洞外。战士们亲切而又责备地说：“老郭！别太冒险了啊。坐下来吧！等炮火缓和了再走！”
    冒台风抢修线路与军民结下友谊
    今年，又是8月23日。夜里，十二级强台风猛袭大嶝岛，路线受到严重的破坏，一时敌情又告紧张，处于特急战备。可是，这时六条路线全被台风吹坏了！郭诗杏清楚地意识到，这时抢修线路，就是抢救岛上人民的生命财产，绝不容片刻迟延。他取得了党委的指示后，就带领林大伟出外抢修。风猛、雨急、夜黑，又不能打手电，他们便弯着身摸索着前进，涉过水深至腹的交通壕、爬过被水淹没的晒盐田……为了保护电话机免受雨淋，他们又脱下自己身上的雨衣，把它一层一层地包裹好。到了需要插立竹竿的地方了，没有挖土工具，他们就用手来挖，手指挖土挖得鲜血直流；贴在背上的湿衣衫冰冷澈骨。可是，人民通信兵的光荣责任感强烈地支持着他们，他们战胜了狂风暴雨，战胜了汹涌而来的山洪，终于把所有的断线全部修复，使党委书记和部队首长能够及时地指挥军民与台风搏斗，与敌人作战。
    为了战争的需要，他们从来没有什么固定的营业时间。炮火一停，战士们和前沿的人民就来寄信、汇款、订报刊，有时是半夜三更，有时是天麻麻亮，他们都热情地为岛上的军民服务；什么时候来，就什么时候办。部队订的报刊很多，几乎是全国各省的报纸和杂志都有，一来就是百把斤，而部队的流动性又很大。因此，他们就经常要扛着一大袋一大袋的邮件和报刊从这里转到那里，有时还得扛回来再转到其他地方去。尽管这样，他们总是负责到底地把它送到。
    大嶝邮电支局一共就是三个人，要办理信函、挂号、汇兑、包裹、报刊和岛上电话等各种业务。他们都学会了全面业务，能营业、封发、值机、修线。现在，连话机、交换机的一般毛病，他们自己也能修理了。新业务一来，三个人就一起研究，一起学习，谁懂什么就教什么，不懂什么就学什么，战斗任务一来，一个人在家总办一切业务，两个人出去查线抢修。
    大嶝邮电支局的职工与岛上的军民结下了战斗的友谊。他们千方百计地为战士和农民群众服务，也得到了战士们和农民们热情的帮助。为了战斗的胜利，在战火中他们已经和岛上军民紧紧地团结成一个人了。
