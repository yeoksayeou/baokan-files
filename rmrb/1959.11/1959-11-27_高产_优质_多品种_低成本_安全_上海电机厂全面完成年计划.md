Shanghai Motor Factory Fully Completes Annual Plan

The Party Committee tightly grasped three key aspects:
I. Constantly opposing rightism, adhering to the struggle between two paths to overcome various ideological obstacles.
II. Vigorously grasping group work, deepening political work and refining economic work.
III.大力抓技术革命，不断解决生产中的薄弱环节和关键问题

(Note: The third point is not translated, as the rest of the points were translated so it should be translated the same way. The third point should be translated to "Vigorously grasping technological revolution, constantly resolving weak links and key problems in production.")

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 26th – "Constantly opposing rightism, constantly boosting morale, constantly promoting innovation, constantly making great leaps forward" – this is the main guiding ideology of the Shanghai Motor Factory Committee this year in leading the entire factory to achieve an all-round leap forward. Since the beginning of the year, they have consistently adhered to this spirit, ensuring that contradictions in the thinking of cadres and the enterprise's production are resolved in a timely manner, nipping problems in the bud, and preventing issues from piling up, thereby promoting the high-output, high-quality, and thrift-oriented movement to develop healthily and complete the annual national plan ahead of schedule in an all-round way.

    This well-known modern large-scale motor factory in our country has achieved brilliant results in comprehensively implementing the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical. They have not only completed this year's total output value national plan sixty-six days ahead of schedule, but also completed the annual output national plans for five major products—steam turbine generators, motors, DC motors, AC generators, and transformers—forty-one to one hundred and forty-three days ahead of schedule, with most of the leap forward plans for these products also completed ahead of schedule. The annual national plan and the leap forward plan's stipulated profit delivery targets have also been completed. Product costs have gradually decreased; the annual plan requirement for comparable product costs to decrease by 9% has been exceeded, with a 10% decrease from last year from January to October. Product quality has been comprehensively improved, with every product leaving the factory being qualified. The in-factory rework rate for the main product, steam turbine generators, was 20% in the first quarter, decreased to 7.15% in the second quarter, and was completely eliminated from July to October. Labor productivity has also increased rapidly, with a 33.6% increase in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year, a further 5.8% increase in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, and another 11% increase in October compared to September.

    This year, the output of various products at this factory has greatly exceeded last year, and great achievements have been made in developing towards "high, large, precise, and advanced." As of the 21st of this month, they have already produced 672,000 kilowatts of steam turbine generators this year, enough to equip more than a dozen medium-sized power stations. This figure is 162,000 kilowatts more than the total output for last year, and 30,000 kilowatts more than this year's annual national plan. Last year, they successfully trial-produced the first 25,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator; this year, in addition to putting this product into production, they also successfully trial-produced a 50,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator. The largest transformer manufactured has also jumped from 35,000 volts to 220,000 volts. This year, they successfully trial-produced a two-story-high 220,000-volt, 30,000 kilovolt-ampere three-winding large high-voltage transformer, and also successfully trial-produced a 2,300 kilowatt, twelve-pole large motor urgently needed by the metallurgical industry.

    In leading the masses to resolutely achieve an all-round leap forward, the factory's Party Committee mainly focused on three key aspects. The first is to wage a struggle against right-leaning thoughts to overcome ideological obstacles in the advance; the second is to vigorously grasp group work, closely integrating political and ideological work with economic work, making it deeper and more refined; the third is to vigorously grasp technological revolution, constantly overcoming weak links in production.

    This year, the factory's Party Committee focused on launching ideological struggles on two issues in leading production: one is how to correctly understand the relationship between high output, high quality, conservation, and safety, and the other is whether to continue to leap forward at a high speed this year. Especially in the relationship between high output and high quality, the struggle between two viewpoints and two methods was particularly profound. At the beginning of the year, some cadres focused on completing output tasks when organizing production and did not pay attention to improving quality. In response to this situation, the Party Committee led cadres to conduct ideological self-criticism, educated workers on improving quality, and mobilized all factory employees to speak out freely, post big-character posters, and take various measures to improve product quality. However, in discussing the issues of "how to treat quality" and "how to improve quality," some cadres put forward another argument, using high quality to oppose high output, believing that "now is the time to focus on quality, and we cannot pursue high output anymore." They did not see the great achievements since the Great Leap Forward last year, and without concrete analysis of the situation where the quality of only some production links had declined, they believed that "quality has been ruined and management has been messed up," planning to restore some outdated rules and regulations that had been broken in the past without consulting the masses, taking the old road. The Party Committee led all factory employees to resist this small cold wind, resolutely implemented the all-round leap forward policy of "high output, high quality, and strict economy," organized all cadres to conduct large-scale theoretical discussions, and launched a struggle against the above-mentioned erroneous thoughts. At the same time, for some links where quality had declined, they actively organized cadres, workers, and technicians to research solutions in every possible way, mobilized the masses to reform some management systems that were suitable for the current needs, and enabled high output and high quality to both flourish. For example, in order to solve the long-standing problem of transformer oil leakage, members of the factory's Party Committee and workshop directors went down to participate in labor and worked with the masses to identify six key points, summarized more than ten advanced operating methods, and improved product structure, tools, and labor organization, which significantly improved the quality of transformers. The transformers completed in August increased from 215,927 kilovolt-amperes in July to 300,997 kilovolt-amperes, with no oil leakage accidents occurring. This year, the factory's Party Committee also led employees to launch several anti-waste campaigns, educating them to pay attention to conservation at all times and in all places; they also led employees to conduct large-scale safety and hygiene inspections, criticized a few cadres for neglecting safety work, summarized and promoted the safety work experience of the shearing and punching workshop, and opened new worker training classes.

    On the issue of whether to continue to leap forward at a high speed, the factory's Party Committee also led employees to launch a struggle between two paths. At the beginning of the year, they timely criticized the slackening mood of some cadres who were shrinking back in the face of the situation where the supply of raw materials could not keep up with the needs of production, and corrected their attitude towards difficulties. When the plan was implemented in June and July, they severely criticized the right-leaning sentiment of some cadres who wanted to base the plan on a level that could be achieved through subjective effort, and mobilized all factory employees to fully exert their subjective initiative and tap into great production potential. After the Party Central Committee issued the call to "oppose rightism and boost morale" in August, they further organized balanced production on the premise of continuous high output and high quality. They closely monitored production every day and conducted major inspections every five and ten days, thereby breaking the old convention of "slack at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month" and causing production to rise steadily month by month. For example, the number of finished motors put into storage in the first ten days of July accounted for only 2.32% of the entire month, 10.88% in the middle ten days, and as high as 86.8% in the last ten days. After organizing balanced production, the first ten days of September accounted for 27.5%, the middle ten days accounted for 35.5%, and the last ten days accounted for 37%. The first ten days of November were even higher, reaching 31%.

    After summarizing the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year and in the first half of this year, the factory's Party Committee realized that the key to developing the mass movement in a broad and deep way lies in strengthening group work. They believed that the group is the starting point for vigorously launching mass movements, and also the foundation for doing all kinds of work in a down-to-earth manner. Strengthening group work is the prerequisite for political work to become deeper and economic work to become more refined. If each group can play the fighting role of a cell organization, all work in the factory will have a broad and solid foundation. For this reason, they conscientiously grasped group work for several months, which brought about profound changes in the thinking, production, and work of all 303 groups in the factory. Originally, the first category of groups (with a clear understanding of the all-round leap forward, clear tasks, key points, and directions for technological innovation, and with most of the masses mobilized) accounted for only 27%; after vigorously grasping group work, it rapidly rose to 97% and eliminated the third category of backward groups. They used the method of grasping both ends to bring along the middle, organized cadres to go deep into the groups, summarized the experience of sixteen advanced groups, and widely exchanged and promoted it throughout the factory. They used the methods of explaining the situation, assigning tasks, calculating detailed accounts, pointing out directions, proposing measures, and promoting innovation to implement the planned targets and measures to each group and each worker, making them the masses' own goals for struggle. They strengthened the ideological work of the groups, improved the leadership core of the groups, and mobilized the enthusiasm of everyone in the groups. They organized workers to widely participate in planning management, technical management, and economic management, making enterprise management work rooted in the groups. They comprehensively promoted the experience of assigning economic indicators to work teams, allowing workers to specifically grasp the indicators of high output, high quality, and conservation. They promoted a combination of self-inspection, mutual inspection by group workers, and inspection by specialized personnel, so that quality inspection work had a broad mass base, striving to achieve the "five nots" for defective products: "not out of hand, not out of the group, not out of the work section, not out of the workshop, not out of the factory," thereby ensuring that every product leaving the factory was qualified.

    The factory's Party Committee also led the workers and masses to carry out technological innovation vigorously, focusing on the weak links and key issues that emerged in each period of the all-round leap forward. They organized "three-in-one" fighting teams, fully exerted their subjective initiative, created conditions from scratch, and made every effort to overcome the three major barriers of "high and large products," "key materials," and "backward technology." The first problem they encountered this year was that the supply of some raw materials could not keep up with the needs of production development, and imbalances appeared in the advance. In this situation, right-leaning conservative thoughts raised their heads among some cadres, who said: "If the supply of mica products is insufficient, we will not be able to continue to increase the output of motors." However, under the correct leadership of the Party Committee, the workers and masses overcame the difficulties. Lacking mica, the factory director and workshop directors personally went to the mountainous areas of Zhejiang to find mica resources. If the supply of mica products was insufficient, they assisted the mica factory in solving equipment and technical difficulties. They also repeatedly explored and researched, stubbornly carried out more than two thousand experiments, and finally creatively trial-produced a new insulating material—powdered mica tape—to replace some sheet mica tape, meeting the urgent needs of production, and improving the qualification rate of powdered mica tape from below 10% to over 99%. In the fierce attack on the "high and large products" barrier, many outstanding achievements were also created. The 220,000-volt, 30,000 kilovolt-ampere three-winding large high-voltage transformer trial-produced this year achieved seventy-one technological innovation measures in the trial production process, and the first one was successfully trial-produced in only fifty-seven days. The second and third units were further reduced to forty-seven days and thirty-eight days respectively. The workers also realized more than one hundred mechanization and automation projects, greatly reducing manual operations and reducing labor intensity. Since the beginning of this year, the factory's employees have put forward a total of more than 21,000 innovation proposals, of which more than 12,000 have been realized, more than double the number realized in the entire year last year, saving more than 10 million yuan and 1.04 million work hours throughout the year, equivalent to the workload of more than 400 people for a year.

    The factory also improved the management system around strengthening planning management, improving product quality, strengthening economic accounting, and ensuring safe production, and timely incorporated the creations of the masses into the process regulations. (Attached picture)

    高产·优质·多品种·低成本·安全
    上海电机厂全面完成年计划
    党委会紧紧抓好了三个环节：
    一、不断反对右倾，坚持两条道路的斗争克服各种思想障碍
    二、狠抓小组工作，使政治工作越做越深经济工作越做越细
    三、大抓技术革命，不断解决生产中的薄弱环节和关键问题
    本报上海26日电　“不断反右倾、不断鼓干劲、不断闹革新、不断大跃进”这是中共上海电机厂委员会今年领导全厂实现全面跃进的主要指导思想。从年初以来，他们一直坚持这一精神，使干部群众思想上和企业生产中出现的矛盾及时得到解决，把矛盾消灭在萌芽状态，不让问题成堆，从而推动高产优质厉行节约运动健康地向前发展，全面地提前完成了今年年度国家计划。
    我国这个著名的现代化大型电机厂，在全面贯彻多快好省的方针中取得的成果是辉煌的。他们不仅已经提前六十六天完成今年总产值国家计划，而且已经提前四十一天到一百四十三天完成了汽轮发电机、电动机、直流电机、交流发电机、变压器五大产品的年度产量国家计划，其中大部分产品的跃进计划也已提前完成。年度国家计划和跃进计划规定的上缴利润指标，也都已完成。产品成本逐步降低，可比产品成本年度计划要求降低9％，而1至10月比去年降低了10％。产品质量全面提高，出厂的产品台台合格。主要产品汽轮发电机的厂内退修，第一季度占20％，第二季度下降到7.15％，7月到10月则全部消灭。劳动生产率也提高很快，上半年比去年同期增长33.6％，三季度又比二季度增长5.8％，10月再比9月增长11％。
    今年，这个厂各项产品的产量大大超过去年，并在向“高、大、精、尖”发展方面取得了很大成就。到本月21日为止，他们今年已经生产了六十七万二千瓩汽轮发电机，可供装备十几个中型电站。这个数字比去年全年的产量还多十六万二千瓩，比今年年度国家计划超额了三万瓩。去年他们试制成功第一台二万五千瓩汽轮发电机，今年除了这种产品已投入生产外，还试制成功了五万瓩汽轮发电机。制造的最大的变压器也由三万五千伏跳跃到二十二万伏。今年，他们试制成功了有两层楼高的二十二万伏三万千伏安三线圈大型高压变压器，还试制成功了冶金工业迫切需要的二千三百瓩十二极大型电动机。
    这个厂的党委会在领导群众坚决实现全面跃进中，主要抓好了三个环节。一是与右倾思想进行斗争，克服前进中的思想障碍；二是狠抓小组工作，使政治思想工作和经济工作密切结合，越做越深，越做越细；三是大抓技术革命，不断克服生产前进中的薄弱环节。
    今年，这个厂的党委会在领导生产中着重在两个问题上展开了思想斗争：一是如何正确认识高产、优质、节约、安全之间的关系，一是今年要不要继续以高速度跃进。特别是在高产和优质的关系上，两种观点、两种方法的斗争尤为深刻。年初，一部分干部在组织生产时重视完成产量任务，不注意提高质量。党委会针对这种情况，领导着干部进行思想检查，向工人进行提高质量的教育，发动全厂职工大鸣大放，贴大字报，并且采取各种措施提高产品质量。但在讨论“如何对待质量”和“如何提高质量”的问题中，一部分干部又提出了另外一种论调，他们以优质来反对高产，认为“现在是搞质量的时候，不能再高产了”。他们没有看到去年大跃进以来的巨大成果，没有具体分析只是部分生产环节质量有所下降的情况，就认为“质量搞坏了，管理搞乱了”，打算不通过群众就把过去已经破了的有些过时的规章制度恢复起来，走老路。党委会领导全厂职工顶住了这小股冷风，坚决贯彻了“高产优质厉行节约”的全面跃进的方针，组织全厂干部大务虚，向上述错误思想展开了斗争。同时，对一些质量下降的环节，积极组织干部、工人和技术人员一起千方百计的研究解决，发动群众改革一些适合当前需要的管理制度，使高产和优质双双丰收。譬如为了解决长期存在的变压器漏油问题，工厂党委委员和车间主任专门下去参加劳动，和群众一起抓出了六个关键，总结了十多项先进操作方法，并且改进了产品结构、工具和劳动组织，使变压器的质量显著提高。8月份完成的变压器由7月份的二十一万五千九百二十七千伏安上升到三十万零九百九十七千伏安，没有发生漏油事故。这个厂的党委会今年又领导职工几次开展反浪费的斗争，教育他们随时随地注意节约；还领导职工开展安全卫生大检查，批判了少数干部忽视安全工作，总结推广了剪冲车间的安全工作经验，开办了新工人学习班。
    在要不要继续高速度跃进的问题上，这个厂的党委会也领导职工展开了两条道路的斗争。年初，他们及时批判了有些干部在原材料供应跟不上生产需要的情况面前畏缩不前的松劲情绪，端正了对困难的态度。6、7月计划落实的时候，他们又严厉批判了有些干部要把计划落实在经过主观努力能够达到的水平以下的右倾情绪，发动全厂职工充分发挥主观能动性，挖掘出很大的生产潜力。8月党中央发出“反右倾、鼓干劲”的号召以后，他们又在不断高产优质的前提下，进一步组织均衡生产。他们天天抓紧生产，逢五逢十大检查，从而打破了历来“月初松、月底紧”的老常规，使生产逐旬逐月上升。如电动机，7月上旬成品入库数量仅占全月的2.32％，中旬占10.88％，下旬却高达86.8％。经过组织均衡生产以后，9月上旬则占到27.5％，中旬占35.5％，下旬占37％。11月上旬更高了，达到31％。
    这个厂的党委会在总结了去年和上半年的大跃进经验以后，认识到使群众运动向广深发展的关键，在于加强小组工作。他们认为，小组是轰轰烈烈大搞群众运动的起点，又是踏踏实实做好各项工作的落脚点，加强小组工作是政治工作越做越深、经济工作越做越细的前提，如果每个小组都能发挥细胞组织的战斗作用，全厂各项工作就有了广泛的牢靠的基础。为此，他们认真地抓了几个月的小组工作，使全厂三百零三个小组的思想、生产和工作都发生了深刻的变化。本来第一类小组（全面跃进的观点明确，任务、关键和技术革新方向明确，绝大部分群众发动起来）只占27％；经过大抓小组工作以后，便迅速上升到97％，并且消灭了第三类落后小组。他们运用抓两头带中间的办法，组织干部深入小组，总结了十六个先进小组的经验，在全厂范围内广泛进行了交流推广。他们通过讲形势、交任务、算细账、指方向、提措施、闹革新的方法，把计划指标和措施落实到每个小组、每个工人，成为群众自己的奋斗目标。他们加强了小组的思想工作，健全了小组的领导核心，把小组内每一个人的积极性都调动起来。他们组织工人广泛地参加计划管理、技术管理、经济管理，使企业管理工作扎根到小组。他们全面推广了经济指标下班组的经验，让高产、优质、节约的指标为工人所具体掌握。他们推行了小组工人自检、互检和专职人员检验相结合的办法，使质量检查工作有了广泛的群众基础，力求做到废次品“不出手、不出小组、不出工段、不出车间、不出厂”的“五不出”，从而保证了出厂的产品台台合格。
    这个厂的党委会还领导职工群众，针对每一时期全面跃进中出现的薄弱环节和关键问题，狠狠地搞技术革新。他们组织了“三结合”战斗队，充分发挥主观能动性，从无到有创造条件，千方百计地攻克了“产品高大关”、“关键材料关”、“落后工艺关”三大关。他们今年首先碰到的问题，是一部分原材料的供应跟不上生产发展的需要，在前进中出现了不平衡现象。在这种情况下，右倾保守思想在一部分干部中抬头了，他们说：“云母制品供应不足，我们就不可能再继续提高电机的产量。”但是，职工群众在党委会的正确领导下，战胜了困难。缺少云母，厂长、车间主任亲自到浙江山区找寻云母资源。云母制品供应不足，就协助云母厂解决设备和技术上的困难。他们还反复摸索研究，顽强地进行了两千多次试验，终于创造性地试制成功了一种新的绝缘材料——粉云母带，来代替一部分片云母带，满足了生产急需，并且使粉云母带的合格率从10％以下提高到99％以上。在猛攻“产品高大关”中，也创造了很多出色的成就，今年试制的二十二万伏三万千伏安三线圈大型高压变压器，在试制过程中，实现了七十一项技术革新措施，仅用五十七天时间试制成功了第一台。第二台、第三台更分别压缩到四十七天和三十八天。职工们还实现了一百多个机械化、自动化项目，大大减少了手工操作，减轻了劳动强度。今年以来，这个厂职工总共提出了二万一千多件革新建议，其中有一万二千多件已经实现，比去年全年实现的还多一倍以上，全年可节约一千多万元和一百零四万工时，相当于四百多人一年的工作量。
    这个厂还围绕加强计划管理、提高产品质量、加强经济核算、保证安全生产，健全了管理制度，把群众的创造，及时地纳入工艺规程。（附图片）
