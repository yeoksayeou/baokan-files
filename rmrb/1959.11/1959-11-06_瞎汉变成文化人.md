    Blind Man Becomes a Cultured Person
    The people's school is dearer than home,
    One day without learning, I feel uneasy.
    Five years have flashed by,
    The blind man has become a cultured person.
    Recording work points, serving as an accountant,
    All of us are farmers!
                  (Min Bei)

    瞎汉变成文化人
    民校比家还要亲，
    一天不学不放心。
    五年闪眼过去了，
    瞎汉变成文化人。
    记工账，当会计，
    全是我们种田人！
                  （闽北）
