Xinhua News Agency, November 7th: The experience exchange meetings of the financial and trade systems of the National "Heroes Conference" have concluded on the 6th and 7th. After several days of in-depth and meticulous experience exchange, the representatives felt that they had more methods and greater confidence. They are determined to use greater enthusiasm to lead the vast number of financial and trade workers to complete and overfulfill the various tasks for 1959 ahead of schedule and to welcome the tasks for 1960.

A total of more than 900 representatives from the commercial, grain, finance, foreign trade, and People's Bank systems participated in the experience exchange meetings. During these few days of meetings, they listened to reports from ministers or vice ministers of various ministries and conducted discussions; many representatives continued to introduce their advanced deeds.

At the experience exchange meeting of the commercial system, more than 200 of the 500-plus representatives spoke at the meeting. They widely introduced advanced experiences from all fronts of commercial work, such as doing a good job in industrial and commercial cooperation, promoting industrial production through supplying raw materials and purchasing products; promoting agricultural and sideline production through supplying agricultural production materials and doing a good job in the procurement of agricultural and sideline products; organizing the people's economic life in cities and industrial and mining areas, serving production and consumption. Many representatives also introduced their experiences in improving service attitude, doing a good job in business management, and doing a good job in warehousing, storage, and transportation. These experiences greatly inspired the representatives. Many representatives understood the specific content of the advanced experiences and drew charts, ready to implement them when they returned.

Over the past few days, representatives of the financial system have exchanged advanced experiences in budget management, enterprise finance, industrial and commercial taxation, financial management of people's communes, and financial management of capital construction. The representatives unanimously believed that promoting production and cultivating financial resources are the material guarantee for completing fiscal tasks. The meeting introduced the experience of Nie Qinquan, a financial officer from Yaohe Management District of Lixi People's Commune in Jingmen County, Hubei Province. Nie Qinquan actively assisted the commune in developing diversified operations. From January to August this year, he organized seven diversified economic productions, which increased the commune's income by more than 30,000 yuan, correspondingly increasing the national fiscal revenue by more than 3,000 yuan. The representatives decided to further implement these experiences in future work.

Advanced producers from the grain, foreign trade, and People's Bank systems have also exchanged experiences in launching mass movements to do a good job in grain procurement and storage, organizing sources of goods from the perspective of production to ensure the completion of export tasks, and supporting industrial and agricultural production through organizing funds and managing funds.

After exchanging experiences and clarifying the direction, the representatives of various industries were full of confidence and enthusiasm. They successively put forward initiatives to the vast number of employees in their respective industries, stating that they are determined to contribute more to socialist construction along with millions of financial and trade workers.

The representatives of the commercial system put forward an initiative to commercial employees nationwide on the 6th. The content is: to do a good job in the procurement of agricultural products and the supply of agricultural production materials and rural daily industrial products to promote the development of agricultural production; to assist the people's communes in doing a good job in production planning and labor arrangement, funding planning, etc., to promote the development of non-staple food production and diversified operations; to closely cooperate with industry and commerce, do a good job in the supply of raw materials, materials, and accessories and the procurement of products to promote the development of industrial and handicraft production; adhering to the principle of "serving production and facilitating the masses," organize the people's economic life; implement the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and vigorously improve business management; continue to carry forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and deepen the commercial technological innovation movement; strive to study Marxism-Leninism, love commercial work, and serve the people wholeheartedly.

The representatives of the financial system adopted an initiative on the morning of the 7th, the content of which is: vigorously carry out mass movements for increasing production and practicing economy, and complete and overfulfill the fiscal work tasks for this year; strive to promote production, help production departments strengthen cost management, do a good job in economic accounting, and achieve the requirements of high yield, high quality, and low cost; vigorously organize revenue, accumulate funds at a high speed on the basis of rapid development of production, and support the continuous leap forward of the national economy; further strengthen the management of various funds, practice strict economy in all aspects, and free up more funds for production and construction for the country; strengthen the planned management of funds; continue to improve rules and regulations.

The representatives of the grain system also put forward an initiative, calling on employees of the national grain departments to vigorously publicize planned grain consumption and economical grain consumption, and do a good job in grain supply; at the same time, they should launch a mass movement to strive to complete the annual grain and oil procurement tasks ahead of schedule and ensure the completion of the annual grain and oil allocation tasks.

Advanced workers in the People's Bank system also put forward an initiative, requiring financial workers across the country to actively organize funds, and manage and use working capital well to fully support the continued leap forward of the national economy. The initiative put forward by the foreign trade system called on foreign trade employees across the country to do a good job in organizing export goods and import work to ensure the timely, high-quality, and high-quantity completion of the state's export and import tasks.

All these initiatives emphasize that resolutely implementing the Party's general line and adhering to putting politics in command and relying on the leadership of the Party are the keys to doing a good job in financial and trade work. All financial and trade enterprises and the vast number of employees must use politics to guide business, and ensure that financial and trade work always advances courageously along the Party's general line of socialist construction.
