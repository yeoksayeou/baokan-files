Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 2nd. According to reports in the newspapers here today, Chairman Ho Chi Minh gave instructions on how to run agricultural production cooperatives well at the summary meeting on experience in the management of agricultural production cooperatives in the entire North. This meeting was held by the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party on October 26 in Ha Dong Province.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that the organization of agricultural cooperatives is to improve the lives of farmers, so that farmers can have sufficient food and clothing, be healthy, and have the opportunity to study, so as to make the country strong and the people rich. He said: The peasant masses listened to the words of the Party and the government and organized cooperatives. Everyone hopes that production can be increased and income can be increased compared with the past. Therefore, the task of the cooperative management committee is how to develop the production of the cooperative.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: Production has increased, and distribution should also be fair and reasonable. He taught cadres and agricultural cooperative managers that they must always keep in mind the policy of "running cooperatives diligently and frugally."

Chairman Ho Chi Minh also said: To manage the cooperative well, the managers of the agricultural cooperative must practice democracy and consult with the members on everything they do. He also instructed that agricultural cooperatives should formulate articles of association. He said that the articles of association of agricultural cooperatives must be formulated by the members through democratic discussion, and consciously observed and implemented by the members.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh reminded all localities to pay attention to organizing agricultural cooperatives to develop sideline economies. Both agriculture and sidelines should be paid attention to, but agriculture should be the main focus. The distribution of income from agriculture and sidelines should also be reasonable.

When talking about the cooperativization movement currently being carried out in various provinces, Chairman Ho Chi Minh once again instructed that attention must be paid to quality when building cooperatives.

Chairman Ho also said that all localities should pay attention to developing various mutual aid organizations, consolidating and developing agricultural cooperatives, and gradually guiding agricultural cooperatives from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives.
