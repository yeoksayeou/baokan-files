    Good Friends Who Have Never Met
    Qu Wen

    Comrade Fu Biju and Comrade Guo'ernieyi·Geligao Liye Weiqi·Shakhmirkin are very close friends. However, their story is different from the stories of ordinary friends. For example, the two of them have never met. Comrade Fu Biju lives in a remote village in Liaoning Province and has never been to the Soviet Union; Comrade Shakhmirkin lives in the beautiful city of Sochi on the Black Sea and has never been to China. Without contact, without introduction, separated by thousands of miles, how was this flower of friendship sown, sprouted, and bloomed?

    Comrade Fu Biju was a division commander in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In 1957, while commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of our army, he thought of a comrade who shared hardships with him during the Long March, a comrade who helped him safely cross the grasslands. Comrade Fu Biju wrote a short article. He wrote about the hardships of the Long March and expressed his deep remembrance of this comrade, longing for a reunion. With irrepressible emotion, he shouted: "My comrade, where are you?" This was a call full of comradeship and deep concern, and this voice resonated in the hearts of many old revolutionary soldiers. It is not surprising, what is interesting is that this voice also reached the distant Black Sea coast, reaching the ears of an old Red Army soldier, Comrade Shakhmirkin, in Sochi, arousing his deep sympathy.

    Shakhmirkin is a retired soldier. During the Great Patriotic War, he commanded operations in an anti-tank unit and was awarded a "Red Banner" medal and four Soviet medals during the war. In a large-scale battle in the Pochinok and Yeliya regions, he was seriously injured while breaking through the encirclement of the German fascist invading army. After treatment, he partially recovered his health and became a disabled soldier.

    He has long held a deep love and affection for the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people's revolutionary armed forces, and the Chinese people. Comrade Fu Biju's short article moved him and made him deeply love the character in the article. The article also evoked many of his own memories of the hard fighting years, which made him care for Comrade Fu Biju and his comrades like his own brothers.

    In April 1957, Comrade Fu Biju suddenly received a letter from the Soviet Union. Comrade Shakhmirkin inquired through the editorial department of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship News" with concern: Has that comrade been found? Have they met? And hoped to get their photos.

    Comrade Fu Biju was deeply moved by the brotherly concern of the Soviet comrades. When he finally made contact with his comrade-in-arms, he immediately told Comrade Shakhmirkin the good news and sent him a photo.

    Soon, the great celebration of the October Socialist Revolution arrived. Like many Chinese people, Comrade Fu Biju wanted to personally extend his congratulations to the Soviet comrades on this day. But there were no Soviet comrades around him, and he had no familiar relatives or friends in the Soviet Union. In this situation, Comrade Fu Biju immediately wrote a warm congratulatory letter and sent the newly published pictorial reporting the reunion of him and his comrade-in-arms to Comrade Shakhmirkin as a gift to congratulate the Soviet friend.

    From then on, the correspondence between these two friends continued, they called each other distant brothers and extended communist greetings to each other. They talked about national construction, about the enemies of peace, and about their respective work and lives. They both regarded each other's letters and photos as invaluable. Their letters are filled with class feelings, filled with the friendship of the Chinese and Soviet people, and filled with the common will of revolutionary soldiers.

    In one letter, Shakhmirkin said: "Although we are far apart, our hearts are connected. The Chinese people are our dear brothers, and we will always give you brotherly assistance in your most difficult times. ... We believe that Sino-Soviet friendship is the guarantee of world peace. Back then, Hitler sowed death. If the imperialist group on the other side of the Atlantic is unwilling to accept this lesson and wants to follow the old path of their predecessors, then they will surely suffer Hitler's fate!" Fu Biju completely agreed with this statement. He, like all the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, always maintains vigilance and is ready to defeat the imperialists' crazy provocations and defend lasting world peace.

    They mutually invited each other to visit their respective countries, to see their garden-like cities and villages. This beautiful wish has not yet been realized, but whether it is them or us, we all believe that it will eventually be realized one day. The flowers of Sino-Soviet friendship bloom everywhere. The flower of friendship between Comrade Fu Biju and Comrade Shakhmirkin will surely bloom more and more beautifully!

    没有见过面的好朋友
    渠文
    符必玖同志和郭尔聂依·格里高利叶维奇·沙赫米尔金同志是一对十分亲近的朋友。但是，他们之间的故事和一般朋友的故事不一样。比如说，他们俩至今没有见过面。符必玖同志住在辽宁省一个偏僻的乡村，从来没有去过苏联；沙赫米尔金同志住在黑海边美丽的索契市，也未到过中国。没有接触，没有介绍，地隔万里，这朵友谊的奇葩，是怎样播种、发芽和开放的呢？
    符必玖同志是中国人民解放军的一个师长。1957年，他在纪念我军建军三十周年的时候，想起了在二万五千里长征时，一个共患难的同志，一个使他安全渡过了草地的战友。符必玖同志就写了一篇短文。他写出了长征的艰辛，并对这个战友寄予了深切的怀念，渴望着重逢。他以不可遏止的感情喊出：“我的战友，你在哪里？”这是饱含同志爱和深切关怀的呼声，这声音在许多老革命军人的心底引起了回响。这是并不奇怪的，有趣的是这声音也传到了遥远的黑海边上，传到了索契城里一个老红军沙赫米尔金同志的耳旁，引起了他深切的同情。
    沙赫米尔金是一个退役军人。在伟大的卫国战争时期，他曾在一个反坦克部队里指挥作战，在战争中曾获得过一枚“红旗”勋章，四枚苏联奖章。在波钦诺克和叶立亚地区一次大规模战役中，在冲出德国法西斯侵略军重围时，他负了重伤。经过治疗，他局部恢复了健康，成了一个残废军人。
    他久已对中国共产党、毛泽东主席、中国人民的革命武装和中国人民怀着无限热爱的浓厚感情。符必玖同志的短文，感动了他，使他深深地爱上了文章中的人物。文章又唤起他自己在艰苦战斗年代的许多回忆，这些回忆使他像关心自己的兄弟一样关心着符必玖同志和他的战友。
    1957年4月，符必玖同志突然接到了一封从苏联寄来的信。沙赫米尔金同志通过“中苏友好报”编辑部关切地问：那位同志是否找到？他们是否见面？并且希望得到他们的照片。
    符必玖同志为苏联同志兄弟般地关切深深感动。当他终于和他的战友取得联系之后，他立刻把这个好消息告诉沙赫米尔金同志，并且寄给他一张照片。
    不久，伟大的十月社会主义革命节大庆到了。符必玖同志像许多中国人一样，很想在这一天能当面向苏联同志道一声贺。但是他周围一个苏联同志也没有，他也没有熟悉的亲友在苏联。在这个情况下，符必玖同志立刻写了一封热情洋溢的贺信，并且把才出版不久的、报道他和他的战友相会的情况的画报寄给了沙赫米尔金同志，并且以这个作为向苏联朋友致贺的礼物。
    从此，这两个朋友的通讯就一直在继续着了，他们互相称呼着远方的兄弟，互相致以共产主义的敬礼。他们谈论着国家的建设，谈到和平的敌人，也谈到各自的工作和生活。他们都把各自的信件和照片看得无上珍贵。在他们的信中充满着阶级的感情，充满了中苏人民的友爱，充满了革命军人的共同的意志。
    沙赫米尔金在一封信里，这样地说过：“我们虽然相距甚远，但我们的心是连在一起的。中国人民是我们的亲兄弟，我们永远在你们最困难的时候，给你们兄弟般的援助。……我们认为，中苏友谊是世界和平的保证。当年，希特勒种下了死亡。如果大西洋彼岸的帝国主义集团不愿接受这个教训，还要走他们老前辈的老路，那么他们必将得到希特勒的下场！”符必玖完全同意这段话。他同中国人民解放军的全体战士一样，永远保持着警惕，随时准备着击败帝国主义者的疯狂挑衅，保卫世界的持久和平。
  他们互相邀请着到各自的国家作客，来看看各自的花园一般的城市和乡村。这个美好的愿望，现在还没有实现，但是不管他们本人还是我们，都相信有一天终会实现的。中苏友谊的花朵处处开。符必玖同志和沙赫米尔金同志这朵友谊之花，一定愈开愈艳！
