Xinhua News Agency, November 7th, New York Dispatch: TASS, New York, November 6th: The Soviet delegation to the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly issued a statement to the press regarding the report submitted by the so-called Lao Subcommittee. This subcommittee was illegally established to investigate the situation in Laos, bypassing the UN Charter, in order to prove the alleged "aggression" of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam against Laos.

The statement said that despite the best efforts of the members of the subcommittee, it was unable to provide any evidence to substantiate the fabricated accusations of the imagined "aggression." The members of the subcommittee admitted: "From all the information provided to the subcommittee, it cannot be clearly confirmed that regular troops of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam crossed the border." The statement said that, therefore, all the absurd accusations collapsed like a house of cards.

The statement said that the Soviet delegation once again emphasized that only strict adherence to the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements can create the necessary conditions for lasting peace in Laos and the Indochina region.

The statement said that the first step to be taken for this purpose is to immediately restore the work of the International Supervisory and Control Commission.

The statement said that if the International Commission cannot resume work soon, then in this case, the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to convene a meeting of the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina without delay to discuss the current situation in Laos.

The Soviet delegation pointed out that the UN's interference in the peaceful settlement of the Lao issue as stipulated in the Geneva Agreements will only exacerbate the situation in Laos.

Xinhua News Agency, November 7th, New York Dispatch: The so-called United Nations Security Council's Subcommittee on Investigating the Situation in Laos, illegally established under the control of the United States, submitted a so-called "investigation report" to the President of the Security Council on the 6th.

This subcommittee went to Laos on September 14th this year to conduct a so-called "investigation." During the month-long "investigation," although the members of the subcommittee colluded with the Sananikone group and racked their brains to fabricate various false evidences, they still could not avoid making the entire "investigation" an international laughingstock. After the main members of the subcommittee returned to the United Nations in mid-October, their report was slow in coming.

The subcommittee's report submitted on the 6th failed to provide any evidence to prove the absurd claim of the United States and the Lao Sananikone group that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had "invaded" Laos. The report had to admit that "From all the information provided to the subcommittee, it cannot be clearly confirmed that regular troops of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam crossed the border."

However, the subcommittee also quoted extensively in the report the so-called "testimonies" of "witnesses" provided by the Sananikone group, saying that the former Pathet Lao fighting forces "received assistance from the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam." These false testimonies stated that there were armed personnel from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the former Pathet Lao fighting forces, that soldiers from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam participated in the "attacks" on strongholds of the Kingdom of Laos, and that the former Pathet Lao fighting forces received equipment, weapons, ammunition, and other assistance from the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, etc. The report then used vague wording to insinuate that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had "interfered" in the internal affairs of Laos. The report said that, according to the documents submitted by the liaison committee established by the Lao (Sananikone) government to consult with the UN representatives, the former Pathet Lao fighting forces "seem" to have received "different degrees and different kinds of support" from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

After the committee submitted its report, the United States delegation to the United Nations, which was trying to find an excuse for further interference in Laos, immediately issued a statement, emphasizing that this report of the United Nations "Laos Investigating Subcommittee" "will enable the Security Council to better understand the dangers facing Laos." The statement also said that "the UN subcommittee has played a calming role in the dangerous situation there," and therefore the United States "is considering what further measures the UN can take to help the Lao people maintain their independence and security." On the same day, White, the press officer of the US State Department, stated more clearly that the US State Department advocates that the United Nations have a permanent presence in Laos. This clearly exposed the US conspiracy to steal the banner of the United Nations to interfere in Laos.

According to a statement issued by a United Nations spokesman on the same day, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld has been considering the possibility of his visit to Laos for several weeks in consultation with the Lao government.

### 苏联出席联合国大会代表团发表声明  联合国的干涉只会加剧老挝局势  老挝小组委员会捏造不出所谓越南“侵略”的“证据”

    苏联出席联合国大会代表团发表声明
    联合国的干涉只会加剧老挝局势
    老挝小组委员会捏造不出所谓越南“侵略”的“证据”
    新华社7日讯　塔斯社纽约6日讯：出席联合国大会第十四届会议的苏联代表团就所谓老挝小组委员会提出的报告向报界发表了一个声明。这个小组委员会是为了证明越南民主共和国对老挝的所谓“侵略”，而避开联合国宪章非法成立起来去调查老挝的局势的。
    声明说，尽管小组委员会的成员用尽了一切努力，它却没有能够提供任何证据，证实对臆想的“侵略”的捏造的指责。小组委员会的委员们承认：“从向小组委员会提供的全部情报看来，不能明确证实有越南民主共和国的正规军越过边界的情事。”声明说，因此，全部荒唐的指责，就像纸牌搭的小房子一样垮台了。
    声明说，苏联代表团再一次强调指出，只有严格履行日内瓦协议和万象协议，才能为老挝和印度支那地区的持久和平创造必要的条件。
    声明说，为此目的而必须采取的第一步是马上恢复国际监察和监督委员会的工作。
    声明说，如果国际委员会不能很快恢复工作，那么在这种情况下，苏联政府认为，必须刻不容缓地召集1954年印度支那问题日内瓦会议参加国开会，以便讨论老挝当前的局势。
    苏联代表团指出，联合国对日内瓦协议所规定的和平解决老挝问题办法的干涉，只会加剧老挝的局势。
    新华社7日讯　纽约消息：在美国把持下非法成立的所谓联合国安全理事会调查老挝局势小组委员会，6日向安理会主席提出一个所谓“调查报告”。
    这个小组委员会是在今年9月14日到老挝进行所谓“调查”的。在一个月的“调查”过程中，尽管这个小组委员会的成员伙同萨纳尼空集团挖空心思，制造了各种伪证，但是，他们仍然无法不使整个“调查”成为一个国际笑柄。在小组委员会的主要成员10月中旬返回联合国后，他们的报告迟迟拟不出来。
    6日提出的小组委员会的报告无法提供任何证据以证明美国和老挝萨纳尼空集团诬蔑越南民主共和国“侵略”了老挝的荒诞说法。报告不得不承认，“从向小组委员会提供的全部情报看来，不能明确证实有越南民主共和国的正规军越过边界的情事。”
    但是，这个小组委员会又在报告中大量引用了萨纳尼空集团提供的“证人”所说的所谓前寮国抗战部队“得到来自越南民主共和国境内的援助”的“证词”。这些伪证说什么在前寮国抗战部队中有越南民主共和国的武装人员，越南民主共和国的士兵参加了对老挝王国据点的“进攻”，前寮国抗战部队得到来自越南民主共和国境内的装备、武器、弹药等援助等等。这个报告然后用含糊的词句影射越南民主共和国“干涉”了老挝内政。报告说，从老挝（萨纳尼空）政府设立来同联合国代表磋商的联络委员会提出的文件来看，前寮国抗战部队“似乎”在越南民主共和国那里得到“不同程度和不同种类的支持”。
    在委员会提出它的报告以后，力图为它进一步干涉老挝寻找借口的美国驻联合国代表团，立即发表声明，强调联合国“老挝调查小组委员会”的这个报告“将使安全理事会能够更好地了解老挝所面临的危险”。声明还说，“联合国小组委员会对那里的危险局势起了使其平静的作用”，因此美国“正在考虑联合国可以采取那些进一步的措施来帮助老挝人民维护他们的独立和安全”。同一天，美国国务院新闻发布官怀特更明白地说，美国国务院主张联合国有人常驻在老挝。这就清楚地暴露了美国要盗用联合国旗帜来干涉老挝的阴谋。
    据联合国发言人同一天发表的声明，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德几个星期以来一直在会同老挝政府考虑他访问老挝的可能性。
