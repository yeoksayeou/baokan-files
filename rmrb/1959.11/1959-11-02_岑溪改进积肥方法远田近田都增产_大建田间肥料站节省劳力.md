    Cenxi Improves Manure Accumulation Methods, Achieving Increased Production in Both Distant and Nearby Fields
    Large-Scale Construction of Field Fertilizer Stations Saves Labor

    (Reported by this newspaper) Guangxi's Cenxi County is constructing new-style field fertilizer stations on a large scale to meet the needs of agricultural development after communization.

    A field fertilizer station consists of a large manure pit capable of holding two to three thousand *dan* of liquid manure and a large manure shed capable of holding three to five thousand *dan*. Both the manure pit and the manure shed are covered with tiles or thatch to prevent sun and rain; the bottom and sides of the manure pit are made of stone or brick, and plastered with lime and sand to prevent leakage.

    After communization, especially after the publication of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a movement to transform hillside fields into rice paddy fields, bad fields into good fields, low yields into high yields, and high yields into even higher yields, achieving large-scale balanced production increases, has been in full swing in various places. At the same time, the problem of labor shortage has emerged. This problem is largely caused by the increased workload of manure accumulation and delivery. Throughout the year, the workload of manure accumulation and transportation accounts for about one-third of the total workload, or even more. As a result, many areas have failed to complete the manure accumulation plan on time and in the required quantities, or have completed it but failed to deliver it to the fields; nearby fields and rice paddy fields receive more fertilizer of better quality, while distant fields and hillside fields receive less fertilizer of poorer quality. In particular, due to insufficient fertilizer reserves, fertilizer is often accumulated and used immediately, resulting in low fertilizer efficiency; or the fertilizer is exposed to sun and rain, reducing its effectiveness.

    The large-scale construction of field fertilizer stations can not only change the original situation of small and irrationally distributed manure pits and sheds, but also better promote the system of year-round manure accumulation and local manure production, and more importantly, save a large amount of labor. Shanglin Brigade of Malu Commune calculated that in the past, one laborer could only deliver 27 *dan* of fertilizer to Pi Dong per day, but after the establishment of field fertilizer stations, this increased to 39 *dan*, increasing labor efficiency by 44%. According to a relatively low estimate, after the establishment of field fertilizer stations, each *mu* of hillside or distant field can save 20 labor days per year in terms of fertilizer delivery alone. Based on this calculation, the county's approximately 150,000 *mu* of distant and hillside fields can save 3 million labor days each year, equivalent to an increase of 10,000 laborers.

    In the construction of field fertilizer stations, agricultural infrastructure construction committees were established at all levels of the commune, and Party committees or branch committees of the commune and brigade were assigned to be specifically responsible for leadership. In order to ensure the completion of more than 7,200 stations before the autumn harvest, various places adopted the "four-pronged approach" of simultaneous propaganda, planning, material preparation, and construction. At the same time, a combination of specialized construction by carpenters and masons during the day and shock material preparation or earth excavation by all commune members at night was implemented. Therefore, the construction of fertilizer stations is still proceeding smoothly despite the busy late-stage field management of late rice and autumn harvest preparations. Some places have encountered some difficulties in construction, the most prominent being the lack of lime in mountainous areas and the lack of wood or thatch in the plains. However, these difficulties have been resolved through cooperation on the basis of equal value and mutual benefit. In addition, various places have paid attention to implementing the spirit of diligence and thrift in running the commune, utilizing old bricks, old tiles, and old materials, saving a lot of investment.

    The county plans to build a field fertilizer station for every 30 *mu* of farmland this year. Before the autumn harvest, the county will launch a shock construction of more than 7,200 stations, more than half of which have already started construction.

    When building stations, various places also considered the comprehensive utilization of fertilizer stations. For example, large manure sheds are generally used as cattle pens, and Nandu, Zhangmu and other communes chose to build stations on high ground in the fields, so that fertilizer can be applied by gravity in the future.

### 岑溪改进积肥方法远田近田都增产  大建田间肥料站节省劳力

    岑溪改进积肥方法远田近田都增产
    大建田间肥料站节省劳力
    本报讯　广西岑溪县正大规模兴建新型的田间肥料站，以适应公社化后农业大发展的需要。
    田间肥料站由一个能容两千到三千担水粪的大粪坑和一所能容三千到五千担的大粪房组成。粪坑、粪房都用瓦或茅草搭盖，防止日晒雨淋；粪坑底部和四周用石头或砖头砌成，并打上灰沙，防止渗漏。
    公社化后，特别是在党的八届八中全会决议公布后，各地山冲田赶垌面田、坏田变好田、低产变高产、高产更高产，实现大面积平衡增产的运动搞得热火朝天。同时也出现了劳动力紧张的问题。而这个问题，在很大程度上是由积肥、送肥工作量的增加引起的。一年四季，积肥、运肥的工作量，约占工作总量的三分之一，甚至还要多些。这样，不少地区积肥没能按时按量完成计划，或者是完成了而没能送到田里；近田、垌面田施肥多，质量好；远田、山冲田施肥少，质量差。特别是由于肥料贮备不足，往往现积现用，肥效不高；或者由于肥料遭受日晒雨淋，降低了肥效。
    大规模地兴建田间肥料站，不仅可以改变原有粪坑、粪房既小又分布不合理的状况，还可以更好地推行常年积肥、就地积肥制肥，更重要的是能够节省出大批的劳动力。马路公社上林大队算了一笔账：这个大队过去送肥到批垌，一个劳动力一般每天只能送二十七担，建立田间肥料站后，就提高到三十九担，劳动效率提高了44％。据比较低的估计，在建立起田间肥料站后，就送肥方面来说，每一亩山冲田或远田在一年中可以节省出二十个劳动日。以此推算，全县远田、山冲田约十五万亩，每年就可节省三百万个劳动日，相当增加一万个劳动力。
    在兴建田间肥料站中，各公社层层建立了农田基建委员会，公社和大队的党组织都分别指定一个党委委员或支部委员负责具体领导。为了保证在秋收前建成七千二百多个站，各地采取了边宣传、边规划、边备料、边动工的四边齐下办法。同时，实行白天由木工、泥工专门建造与夜晚全体社员突击备料或挖土方相结合。因此，在当前晚稻后期田间管理和秋收准备繁忙的情况下，修建肥料站的工作仍然能够顺利地进行。有的地方，在兴建中碰到一些困难，比较突出的是山区缺乏石灰，平原缺乏木料或茅草。但由于在等价互利的基础上进行协作，这些困难都一一解决了。此外，各地注意贯彻勤俭办社的精神，利用旧砖、旧瓦、旧料，节省了不少投资。
    这个县规划在今年内每三十亩田地兴建一个田间肥料站。在秋收前，全县要突击兴建七千二百多个，其中半数以上已经动工。
    各地在建站时，还考虑到肥料站的综合利用问题。比如普遍将大粪房兼作牛栏，南渡、樟木等公社选择在田地的高处建站，以便将来实行施肥自流化。
