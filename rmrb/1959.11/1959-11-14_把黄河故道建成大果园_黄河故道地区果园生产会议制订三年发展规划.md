Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: Work hard, struggle for two or three years, and build the 15 million mu of sandy and semi-sandy areas in the old course of the Yellow River in the four provinces of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong into fruit production bases for apples, grapes, and pears, turning the sandy area stretching thousands of miles from Zhengzhou in the west to the coast in the east into the largest orchard belt. This is the grand plan proposed by the Orchard Production Conference in the Old Course of the Yellow River area recently held by the Ministry of Agriculture in Zhengzhou.

The sandy and semi-sandy areas in the old course of the Yellow River were formed by the Yellow River changing its course many times over thousands of years. Here, every winter and spring, the wind blows sand, and yellow sand fills the sky, burying villages and farmland. Before liberation, only sporadic fruit trees were planted here. After liberation, orchards were established in a planned way. By 1957, 1.05 million mu of orchards had been created. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, several tree planting and afforestation campaigns were launched in succession, planting more than 1.84 million mu of fruit trees, which was 175% of the original constructed area. Due to the strengthening of technical guidance for existing fruit trees, the yield increased dramatically. The famous Dangshan crisp pear had a total output of 4 million jin last year, and this year the total output reached more than 14 million jin. The Yifeng Horticultural Farm in Henan Province, newly built after liberation, achieved a total output of 2 million jin of Muscat grapes this year, more than double the total output of last year. The fruit income of the Wugang People's Commune in Fengqiu County this year exceeded four times the agricultural income.

At present, there are 73 state-owned horticultural farms and 482 commune-run horticultural farms in the old course area. In the past two years, Henan Province has trained more than 40,000 person-times of local horticultural experts from the communes. Anhui and Jiangsu provinces trained more than 2,500 intermediate-level technical cadres last year. Various places have also cultivated a large number of seedlings using rapid seedling raising methods, laying a material foundation for large-scale orchard development in the future. At the same time, this area is located in the Central Plains, with a mild climate and no severe frost damage. Trees such as grapes and pomegranates can overwinter in the open air, which is more suitable for planting apples. Moreover, the Beijing-Guangzhou, Tianjin-Pukou, and Longhai railways and the Grand Canal running north-south crisscross the entire territory, and products can be transported to all parts of the country in a timely manner.

The meeting analyzed the favorable situation and formulated a three-year development plan for the future. The meeting called on the 1,011 communes and 46.19 million people in the entire Yellow River's old course area to continue to go all out, seize seed collection and seedling cultivation, strengthen the management of young trees, resolutely implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, carry out diversified operations centered on fruit tree production, and achieve an all-round leap forward in fruit, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.

The meeting was attended by 117 people, including deputy directors of agricultural and forestry departments and cadres from special districts, counties, communes, horticultural farms, and stations from the four provinces of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong.

    把黄河故道建成大果园
    黄河故道地区果园生产会议制订三年发展规划
    据新华社郑州讯　鼓足干劲，奋战两三年，把河南、安徽、江苏、山东四省的一千五百万亩黄河故道沙区、半沙区，建成苹果、葡萄、梨的果品生产基地，使西起郑州、东至海滨绵亘几千里的沙区，变成一条最大的果园带。这是农业部最近在郑州召开的黄河故道地区果园生产会议提出的宏伟规划。
    黄河故道沙区、半沙区，是几千年来黄河多次改道造成的。这里每到冬春季节，风起沙飞，黄沙漫天，埋没村庄和农田。解放前，这里只种植了零星果树，解放后，才有计划的建立果园。到1957年止，已经营造果园一百零五万亩。在大跃进的1958年至1959年，接连开展了几次植树造林运动，种植果树达一百八十四万多亩，为原来营造面积的175％，对已有的果树，由于加强了技术指导，产量一跃再跃。著名的砀山酥梨，去年总产四百万斤，今年总产量达到一千四百多万斤。解放后新建的河南省仪封园艺场，今年玫瑰香葡萄总产达到二百万斤，超过去年总产量两倍以上。封丘县五岗人民公社，今年的果品收入超过农业收入的四倍。
    现在故道地区已建国营园艺场七十三个，人民公社的社办园艺场有四百八十二个。两年来，河南省训练公社园艺土专家四万多人次。安徽、江苏两省去年训练出的中级技术干部就有两千五百多人。各地还用快速育苗办法培育了大量的苗木，为今后大规模发展果园打下物质基础。同时，这里地处中原，气候温和，没有严重的冻害，葡萄、石榴等树可以露地越冬，更适宜栽种苹果，并且有京广、津浦、陇海三条铁路和南北大运河纵横全境，产品可以及时运往全国各地。
    会议分析了有利形势，订出了今后三年的发展规划。会议号召全黄河故道地区的一千零一十一个公社，四千六百一十九万人，在党和毛主席的领导下，继续鼓足干劲，大抓采种育苗，加强幼树管理，坚决贯彻农业“八字宪法”，开展以果树生产为中心的多种经营，实现果、农、林、牧、副全线跃进。
    参加会议的有河南、安徽、江苏、山东四省农林厅副厅长和专、县、公社、园艺场、站的干部共一百一十七人。
