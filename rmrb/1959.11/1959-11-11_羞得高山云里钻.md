    So Ashamed, the High Mountain Dives into the Clouds
    Zhu Di
    Building a building in the morning at the foot of the mountain,
    Looking up, the high mountain touches the sky;
    At noon, working hard with renewed vigor,
    I stand shoulder to shoulder with the high mountain;
    In the evening, looking down when work is done,
    So ashamed, the high mountain dives into the clouds.

    羞得高山云里钻
    朱迪
    早上盖楼山下边，
    仰望高山顶着天；
    中午加劲干一番，
    我和高山肩并肩；
    晚上收工低头看，
    羞得高山云里钻。
