The Blossoming of Cultural Flowers
Albania　Yaweier Maliya

　　A few days ago, I visited a village in southern Albania. From the village square, one could see a calm, azure sea. Closer to us, a few hundred meters away, we could see the conical marker delineating the border between Albania and the Kingdom of Greece. This village is called Konispol. Of course, this name means nothing to foreign readers, as it is unfamiliar to them. But for us Albanians, besides cherishing this village as we cherish every inch of our land, it is also famous for its role in several important periods of our national life.

　　More than a hundred years ago, in 1847, the first Albanian novel was written in Konispol. Of course, it was an ordinary novel, but it was significant for Albanian literature, which began to develop as early as the sixteenth century.

　　Last year, this village established a joint agricultural cooperative consisting of five small cooperatives. This cooperative is called "Victory of Leninism" and is one of the largest cooperatives in our country. In September of this year, the Tirana newspapers published a sensational piece of news: "An Albanian village opened a middle school this year." Do you know which village this is? It is Konispol. This is the first middle school opened in the Albanian countryside. Don't think that just because the first Albanian novel was produced here, it is the most cultured place in Albania. The author of the novel was a literary phenomenon unrelated to the life of the village. Fifteen years ago, until November 29, 1944, when Albania was liberated from the fascist imperialist robbers, this village was a land of illiteracy. Very few farmers could read their ancestors' novels, practically none. Fifteen years later, this village has transitioned from complete illiteracy to opening a middle school. I believe that the miracle of this village is a symbol of all the transformations that Albania has undergone in the past fifteen years, a symbol of the great cultural revolution. For our country, which inherited a very backward legacy from the past, the cultural revolution naturally had to start with education.

　　When I asked Gocho Yelia, the chairman of the "Victory of Leninism" cooperative, why they asked the government to open a middle school in the village, he replied:

　　"We need cadres. Our village is a prosperous agricultural cooperative with over a thousand hectares of land, four thousand sheep, and so on. Within five years, we will plant 200,000 orange trees and many olive trees, and double the number of livestock. How can we manage such a large economy without educated people? In the future, we will also build hospitals and cultural centers. How can the cooperative advance without educated people?"

　　This answer more or less explains the enormous scale of Albanian education and culture.

　　Fifteen years ago, Albania was the most backward country in Europe in terms of industry, agriculture, and culture. There were only a few factories producing soap and macaroni, or rather workshops, and some small factories making olive oil and flour mills in some places. Agriculture was dominated by feudalism, with primitive plows used for cultivation, completely ignorant of tractors and mineral fertilizers. Under these conditions, the need for cadres was very small. On the other hand, the feudal lords and bourgeoisie who ruled our country were afraid of culture and intellectuals. For example, under the monarchical system (1924-1939), there were only five or six middle schools and about six hundred primary schools in the whole of Albania, and not a single institution of higher learning. Very few university students studied in other European countries. In 1938, only sixty-five university students received state scholarships. The primary school buildings were extremely old, mostly barracks from the Turkish rule. The education expenditure in the national budget was pitifully small. For example, from 1924 to 1939, the expenditure for construction was eleven million gold francs, allocated as follows:

　　1. Military engineering——3.3 million;
　　2. Public buildings (government ministries)——2.74 million;
　　3. Royal palace and royal family——2.21 million;
　　4. Hospitals——1.54 million;
　　5. Prisons——680,000;
　　6. Schools——430,000;
　　7. Various buildings——70,000.

　　There were more prisons than schools, and more barracks than hospitals. It is clear that under these circumstances fifteen years ago, until the liberation of Albania, more than 80% of the people were illiterate.

　　In short, the cultural revolution had to start with the most basic alphabet. After the victory of the people's revolution, the Party and the government faced enormous tasks. At the same time, the struggle to popularize education and culture began. Schools were immediately established everywhere. The number of normal schools increased to train more teachers, and middle school graduates or dropouts also helped as teachers. Teacher training classes, crash courses, or accelerated classes were opened everywhere. Perhaps this reduced the teaching level to some extent, but it was better than letting children remain illiterate. Revolutionary measures had to be taken. Today, on the eve of the fifteenth anniversary of Albania's liberation, there are no illiterate people under the age of forty. There are now 2,700 primary schools with 9,000 teachers. Fifteen years ago, only five major cities had middle schools. Now every city has middle schools, and even the countryside has one. The Tirana State University is the youngest university in Europe. It has more than 3,000 students, including students from great China, who can now speak Albanian fluently. Hundreds of students are studying in universities in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and China. They are studying in departments not available in our universities. Over the past fifteen years, thousands of cadres have been trained. For example, today, the number of engineers in the "Stalin" United Textile Factory in Tirana alone is more than the number in the whole of Albania before liberation. In the past two years, the medical department of Tirana University has trained more doctors than the total number of doctors in Albania in 1939. Nevertheless, despite the increasing number of cadres, there is still a constant feeling of shortage. This is a problem well known to all socialist countries, because our country is developing day by day. New factories are being built, agriculture is being mechanized, and our countryside requires more and more knowledgeable people. For feudal Albania, illiterate people were necessary, but socialist Albania needs people with secondary and higher education. Another way to train cadres is to run night schools for workers without interrupting their work. Schools for young people and adults work day and night.

　　The issue of education is a very important aspect of the Albanian cultural revolution. But this is not all. In September of this year, a group of actors from the Tirana Opera House performed in Bari, Italy, during the Mediterranean Coastal Countries Fair. This surprised the Italians very much. One reason was that the imperialist newspapers described Albania as the poorest country; the other reason was that when the Italian army withdrew from Albania in 1943, Albania not only did not have an opera house, it did not have a theater at all. Albania was the only country in Europe without a theater. The Italian press praised the talent of the Albanian actors. The actors brilliantly performed excerpts from operas by famous Italian composers Verdi, Rossini, and Mascagni. The Tirana Opera and Ballet Theater, the drama theaters in many cities in Albania, the rural choirs, etc., are all unimaginable to those who knew Albania fifteen to twenty years ago. Karl Marx, the founder of scientific communism, said very well: Socialism brings bread and roses to everyone. Culture, spiritual food, knowledge, music, art, books—these are the flowers.

　　Let me say a few more words about books. In the past fifteen years, Albania has published more books than all the books published from 1555, when the first Albanian book was published, to 1944, when Albania was liberated.

　　Albanian literature was founded relatively early, but it did not mature until the end of the nineteenth century. Its representative was the great poet Naim Frashëri. This is patriotic, militant literature. This literature has produced the most beautiful flowers in poetry, prose, and especially in novels, although somewhat later. The Albanian novel has developed particularly well under the people's government today. Socialist realist Albanian literature and art have produced many valuable works, which have even spread abroad. We have the right to be proud of our writers and artists, who firmly stand on the Party's position and wage an irreconcilable struggle against imperialism and its running dogs, the Yugoslav revisionists, in their works. They have made valuable contributions to the cause of socialism, to the consolidation of the friendship between the peoples of our socialist camp, and to the consolidation of peace.

　　Cultural flowers are blossoming! Albania will become a garden full of flowers, not only figuratively speaking, but also in the literal sense of the word. (Attached pictures)

    文化之花欣欣向荣
    阿尔巴尼亚　雅威尔·马里阿
    几天以前，我到过阿尔巴尼亚南方的一个村子。从村子的广场上可以遥望到一片平静的蔚蓝色海水。而离我们更近一些，在离我们几百米远的地方，可以看到划分阿尔巴尼亚和希腊王国边界的锥形标志。这个村子叫做科尼斯波尔。当然，这个名称对于外国读者是不能说明任何问题的，因为这对他们是陌生的。而对于我们阿尔巴尼亚人，除了我们像珍爱我们的每一寸土地那样珍爱这个村子以外，还因为它在我们国家生活的若干重要时期的表现而出名。
    一百多年以前，即1847年，在科尼斯波尔写成了第一部阿尔巴尼亚文的小说。当然这是一部平常的小说，但是它对于早从十六世纪开始发展的阿尔巴尼亚文学却是有意义的。
    去年这个村子建立了由五个小合作社组成的联合农业合作社。这个合作社的名称叫做“列宁主义的胜利”，它是我国最大的合作社之一。今年9月地拉那的报刊登载了一个轰动舆论的消息：“阿尔巴尼亚的一个村子在今年开办了一所中学。”您知道这是哪个村子吗？这就是科尼斯波尔村。这是阿尔巴尼亚农村开办的第一所中学。您可不要以为这里曾经产生过第一部阿尔巴尼亚文的小说，就是阿尔巴尼亚最有文化的地方。关于小说的作者的事，是同这个村子的生活无关的文学上的非常现象。十五年以前，直到1944年11月29日阿尔巴尼亚从法西斯帝国主义强盗统治下解放的那一天止，这个村子还是文盲的天下，能阅读祖辈的小说的农民是很少很少，屈指可数的。十五年后的今天，这个村子已经从完全处于文盲状态过渡到了开办中学。我认为这个村子的奇迹，是十五年来阿尔巴尼亚实行的一切改造的象征，是伟大的文化革命的象征。从过去接受了非常落后的遗产的我国，要实行文化革命当然是从教育着手。
    当我询问“列宁主义的胜利”合作社主席戈乔·椰里亚为什么他们要求政府在村里开办中学时，他回答说：
      “我们需要干部。我们村子是富裕的农业合作社，我们有一千多公顷土地，四千头羊及其它等等。五年内我们要种植二十万棵橘树和许多橄榄树，要把牲畜头数增加一倍。没有有文化的人，怎能管理这样大的经济呢？今后我们还要修建医院和文化宫。如果没有受教育的人，合作社怎能前进呢？”
    这个答复同时又或多或少地说明阿尔巴尼亚教育和文化的巨大规模。
    十五年以前，阿尔巴尼亚在工业、农业和文化方面是欧洲最落后的国家。国内只有很少几家生产肥皂、通心粉的工厂，更确切些说是作坊，有的地方有制橄榄油的小工厂和磨面的磨坊。农业受封建主义的统治，用原始的犁耕地，根本不知有拖拉机和矿物肥料。在这种条件下，对干部的需要是很小的。另一方面，封建主和资产阶级统治我国，他们害怕文化，害怕知识分子。比如在君主专制制度下（1924—1939年）整个阿尔巴尼亚只有五、六所中学，约有六百所小学，根本没有一所高等学校。在其他欧洲国家学习的大学生也非常之少。1938年靠国家助学金上大学的大学生只有六十五人。小学的校舍极为陈旧，多半是土耳其统治时期的兵营。国家预算中的教育开支少得可怜。例如，从1924到1939的十五年内用于建设的费用为一千一百万金法郎，这笔钱的分配如下：
    一、军事工程——三百三十万；
    二、公共建筑（政府各部）——二百七十四万；
    三、王宫和王室——二百二十一万；
    四、医院——一百五十四万；
    五、监狱——六十八万；
    六、学校——四十三万；
    七、各种建筑——七万。
    监狱多于学校，兵营多于医院。一目了然，十五年前在这种情况下，直到阿尔巴尼亚解放为止，80％以上的人是文盲。
    总之，文化革命应该从最起码的字母开始。在人民革命胜利后，党和政府面临着巨大的任务。与此同时开始了普及教育和文化的斗争。到处立即开始兴办学校。师范学校的数量增加了，以便有更多的教师，中学毕业或未毕业的人也帮作教师工作。到处开办了教师进修班、速成学校或速成班，也许这在某种程度上降低了教学水平，但是总比让孩子当文盲好得多。必须采取革命性的措施。今天在阿尔巴尼亚解放十五周年前夕，四十岁以下的人已经没有文盲了。现有小学二千七百所，教师九千人。十五年前，只有五个大城市有中学。现在各个城市都有中学，而且连农村都有了一所中学。地拉那国立大学是欧洲最年青的大学。它有三千多学生，其中有伟大中国的留学生，他们现在可以运用自如地讲阿尔巴尼亚话了。成百的留学生在苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国和中国等国的大学里学习。他们是在我国大学所没有的科系里学习。十五年来培养了数千名干部。例如，今天仅地拉那“斯大林”联合纺织工厂的工程师，就比解放前阿尔巴尼亚全国的还要多。两年来，地拉那大学医学系培养的医生比1939年阿尔巴尼亚全国的医生还多。尽管如此，尽管干部数量日益增多，仍时时感到不足。这是一切社会主义国家都熟知的问题，因为我们的国家是在逐日地发展着。新的工厂建设起来了，农业在实行机械化，我们的农村要求越来越多的有知识的人。对于封建的阿尔巴尼亚说来，目不识丁的人是必要的，但是社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚却需要有受过中等和高等教育的人材。培养干部的另外一种方法，是办职工不脱产学习的夜校。给青年人和成年人办的学校夜以继日地在工作着。
    教育问题是阿尔巴尼亚文化革命极重要的方面之一。但这还不是一切。今年9月地拉那歌剧院的一批演员，在地中海沿岸国家博览会期间曾在意大利的巴利演出。这使意大利人很吃惊。一是因为帝国主义报刊把阿尔巴尼亚描写成为最穷的国家；再则因为1943年意大利军队撤出阿尔巴尼亚时，阿尔巴尼亚不仅没有一家歌剧院，根本没有剧院。阿尔巴尼亚曾是欧洲唯一没有剧院的国家。意大利报刊盛赞阿尔巴尼亚演员的才干。演员们精湛地表演了著名意大利作曲家威尔第、罗西尼、马斯卡尼创作的歌剧中的片断。地拉那的歌剧和芭蕾舞剧院、阿尔巴尼亚好多城市的话剧院、农村的合唱团等，都是十五至二十年前了解阿尔巴尼亚的人们所不能想像的。科学共产主义的创始人卡尔·马克思说得非常好：社会主义给一切人带来了面包和玫瑰花。文化，精神食粮，知识，音乐，艺术，书籍——这就是花朵。
    关于书我再说两句。十五年来，阿尔巴尼亚出版的书籍，比从1555年出版第一部阿尔巴尼亚文书籍起到1944年阿尔巴尼亚解放止出版的全部书籍还要多。
    阿尔巴尼亚文学奠基比较早，但是直到十九世纪末叶才成熟起来，它的代表者是伟大的诗人纳伊马·弗拉舍里。这是爱国主义的、富有战斗性的文学。这一文学在诗歌、散文，特别是长篇小说中开出了最美好的花朵，虽然较晚一些。阿尔巴尼亚的长篇小说在今天人民政权下特别有了发展。社会主义现实主义的阿尔巴尼亚文学和艺术，产生了好多有价值的作品，它们甚至已流传到国外。我们有权为我国的作家、艺术家自豪，他们牢牢地站在党的立场上，在自己的作品中为反对帝国主义及其走卒南斯拉夫修正主义者而进行不调和的斗争。他们为社会主义事业，为巩固我们社会主义阵营大家庭各国人民的友好，为巩固和平作出了宝贵的贡献。
    文化之花欣欣向荣！阿尔巴尼亚将变成百花盛开的花园，不仅从形象来说，而且就这个词的具体含义来说都是如此。（附图片）
