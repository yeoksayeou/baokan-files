Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 13th: Wuhan City has already exceeded its annual total industrial output value plan on November 8th, with a total output value increase of 70.68% compared to the same period last year.

According to statistics from relevant leading departments in Wuhan City as of November 6th, out of 149 major products in the city, 62 have completed or exceeded their annual state plans, and most of the other products are close to completion. 405 enterprises have completed their annual total output value plans. Although several important products such as steel, coke, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth have not yet completed their annual plans, their output has greatly increased compared to the same period last year, such as steel increasing by 15.29 times, pig iron increasing by 11.8 times, coke increasing by 8.65 times, and large machine tools increasing by 2.47 times. Product quality has significantly improved, such as the pass rate of open-hearth steel in October rising from 82.3% in August to 96.94%. The first-grade and above rate of cotton yarn increased from 57.19% in August to 85.96%. The labor productivity of workers from January to October cumulatively completed 99.5% of the annual plan. By the end of October, industrial enterprises under the city's jurisdiction had completed 85.75% of the annual profit plan, and the cumulative cost from January to October was 5.29% lower than the state plan.

On November 10th, the city held a radio rally to celebrate the early completion of this year's state industrial output value plan. Song Kanfu, First Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, called on all city employees at the meeting to resolutely implement the Party's instructions, respond to the call of the National Conference of Heroes, hold high the red flag of the General Line, resolutely oppose right-leaning tendencies, push the production increase and economy drive centered on technological innovation and technological revolution to a new peak, complete this year's leap forward plan ahead of schedule in a comprehensive and overfulfilled manner, and ensure the preparation for continued leap forward next year.

In the first quarter of this year, all industrial enterprises in Wuhan City vigorously carried out a production increase and economy drive centered on technological innovation and technological revolution. Especially after the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were conveyed, after opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, the mass movement quickly formed a climax. According to statistics by the end of October, industrial workers in the city have realized more than 35,000 innovation projects.

The continued leap forward in industrial production in Wuhan City, in addition to the backbone role played by large enterprises, the "small but complete industrial systems" and district and street industries after rectification are also increasingly showing their power. In the past, 70% of the daily industrial products needed by Wuhan City relied on imports from other places, but now it has changed to 80% being produced in the city.

This newspaper reports that Chengdu City had exceeded this year's total industrial output value plan by 2.77% by the end of October. The total output value is equivalent to 154.33% of the city's total industrial output value for the entire year of last year. From January to September, the output of 64 major products in the city, including steel, pig iron, power generation, coke, electrolytic copper, electric motors, locomotives, measuring tools, cutting tools, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and machine-made paper, has exceeded the output of the great leap forward year of 1958.

This year, the Chengdu industrial front resolutely implemented the general line of building socialism and a complete set of "walking on two legs" principles, and continued to vigorously carry out mass movements. On the basis of last year's great leap forward, a prosperous and comprehensive leap forward situation emerged at the beginning of this year. Chengdu City did not have a steel industry in the past, but it started from scratch in the mass steelmaking movement last year. Now it has built four key units: Chengdu Steel Plant, Chengdu Steel Pipe Plant, Chengdu Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Plant, and the steelmaking workshop of Chengdu Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant. In addition to completing the national plan this year, the machinery industry manufactured heavy equipment for the steel industry in the steel protection collaboration competition, such as rolling mills with an annual output of 30,000 tons, steelmaking converters, and overhead cranes with tens of tons of lifting capacity. The chemical and building materials industries have produced products that have never been produced before, such as calcium carbide, coal tar, caustic soda, soda ash, tannin extract, pesticides, and cement. From January to September, the city added 1,373 new products such as round steel, flat steel, light rails, and hydraulic pumps. While modern industry is developing rapidly, street industries and commune-run industries that use indigenous methods or a combination of indigenous and foreign methods have also developed greatly.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining: Industrial enterprises under Xining City have overfulfilled the annual production plan 68 days ahead of schedule.

This year's total industrial output value and output of major products in Xining City have further increased on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958. The actual total industrial output value completed from January to October 24 this year was 110.99% of this year's annual plan, an increase of 145.5% compared to the same period last year. The output of major products such as steel, iron, and machinery has increased significantly. Labor productivity increased by 95.28% compared to the same period last year, and the actual profit turned over was 104.24% of the annual plan.

This significant achievement in industrial production in Xining City is the result of the great power displayed by the Party's General Line, and the result of the in-depth implementation of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Provincial Party Committee. Since the large-scale battle in August and September, a new high tide of socialist labor competition has been booming, production has been rising steadily, and new products have been continuously trial-produced.

    看，跃进的步伐何等豪迈！
    武汉成都西宁大搞群众运动
    全年工业产值计划提前实现
    据新华社武汉13日电　武汉市已经在11月8日提前超额完成了全年工业总产值计划，总产值比去年同期增长70.68％。
    据武汉市有关领导部门到11月6日止的统计：全市一百四十九种主要产品中，已经有六十二种完成或超额完成了全年国家计划，其他产品大部分接近完成。完成了全年总产值计划的企业已有四百零五个。钢铁、焦炭、棉纱、棉布等若干重要产品虽然还没有完成全年计划，但是产量都比去年同期有很大增长，如钢增长十五点二九倍，生铁增长十一点八倍，焦炭增长八点六五倍，大型机床增长二点四七倍。产品质量显著提高，如10月份平炉钢的合格率由8月份的82.3％上升为96.94％。棉纱一等一级以上品率由8月份的57.19％上升为85.96％。工人的劳动生产率1至10月累计完成年计划99.5％。市属各工业企业到10月底已完成全年利润计划85.75％，1至10月的累计成本比国家计划降低5.29％。
    11月10日，全市举行了庆祝提前完成今年工业总产值国家计划的广播大会。中共武汉市委第一书记宋侃夫在会上号召全市职工坚决贯彻党的指示，响应全国群英会的号召，高举总路线的红旗，坚决反透右倾，把以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动推向新的高峰，提前全面超额完成今年的跃进计划，保证做好明年继续跃进的准备。
    今年第一季度，武汉市各工业企业都轰轰烈烈地开展了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。特别是在党的八届八中全会决议传达以后，经过反右倾，鼓干劲，群众运动迅速形成高潮。根据到10月底的统计，全市工业职工共实现了三万五千多件革新项目。
    武汉市工业生产继续跃进，除了大企业发挥了骨干作用以外，经过整顿以后的“小洋群”和区街工业也日益显示出它们的威力。过去武汉市需要的日用工业品，70％依靠外地进货，现在已改变为80％由本市生产。
    本报讯　成都市到10月底止已超额2.77％完成今年的工业总产值计划。总产值相当于去年全年工业总产值的154.33％。1月到9月，全市钢、生铁、发电量、焦炭、电解铜、电动机、机车、量具、刃具、棉纱、棉布、机制纸等六十四种主要产品的产量，已超过大跃进的1958年全年的产量。
    今年成都市工业战线坚决贯彻执行了建设社会主义总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，继续大搞群众运动，在去年大跃进的基础上，今年一开始就出现了欣欣向荣、全面跃进的大好局面。成都市过去没有钢铁工业，在去年大办钢铁的群众运动中平地起家，现在已建成了成都钢铁厂、成都钢管厂、成都量具刃具厂的钢铁厂和成都机车车辆厂的炼钢车间等四个重点单位。机械工业今年除了完成国家计划以外，在保钢协作竞赛中，为钢铁工业制造了年产三万吨的轧钢机、炼钢转炉、起重几十吨的行车等重型设备。化学和建筑材料等工业，生产了电石、煤焦油、烧碱、纯碱，栲胶、农药、水泥等过去从来没有生产过的产品。1月至9月，全市新增加的产品有圆钢、扁钢、轻轨、液压泵等一千三百七十三种。在现代工业迅速发展的同时，用土法或土洋结合的方法生产的街道工业和社办工业，也有很大发展。
    据新华社西宁电　西宁市属工业企业已经提前六十八天超额完成了全年生产计划。
    西宁市今年工业总产值和主要产品的产量，在1958年大跃进的基础上有了进一步增长。今年1月到10月24日实际完成的工业总产值，为今年全年计划的110.99％，比去年同期增长145.5％，钢、铁、机械等主要产品产量都有了较大幅度的增长。劳动生产率比去年同期提高95.28％，实际上交的利润为年度计划的104.24％。
    西宁市工业生产的这一重大成就，是党的总路线显示巨大威力的结果，是党的八届八中全会和省委第十二次全体会议精神深入贯彻的结果。全市从大战8、9月开始，社会主义劳动竞赛新高潮轰轰烈烈，生产节节上升，新产品也不断地试制出来。
