Workers Can Also Design
Recording the Deeds of the First Automobile Factory's Steering Gear Housing Group Workers Changing Designs to Improve Work Efficiency
In 1958, a year filled with triumphant songs of socialist construction, a red flag named "Satellite" was hung on the steel beam of the Steering Gear Housing Group in the Chassis Workshop of the First Automobile Factory. It shone like the rising sun throughout the factory, coloring the hearts of tens of thousands of automobile workers red!

In January 1958, Factory Director Rao Bin, in a report to the factory's employee representative assembly, presented the factory's long-term plan, which greatly excited Zhu Wuxi of the Steering Gear Housing Group. On his way back to the workshop, he walked along, daydreaming: "In the future, when annual automobile production reaches hundreds of thousands of vehicles, how many times will our factory expand! The factory's surrounding walls will be torn down, the employee dormitories will be moved farther away from the factory, and even electric buses won't be enough for workers to commute, they'll have to take trains…" A magnificent automobile factory unfolded in Zhu Wuxi's mind. But then he felt that thinking like this was not in line with the spirit of achieving more, faster, better, and more economically.

Not long after, based on instructions from the Municipal Party Committee, the factory launched a campaign among all employees focusing on examining production (examining production management, product design, equipment potential, rules and regulations). The movement quickly unfolded in the Steering Gear Housing Group. In just three days, eighteen workers posted two hundred and ninety big-character posters. Qin Fengzhang, the Party group leader, and Zhu Wuxi, the administrative group leader, were delighted to see that the workers had put forward many suggestions for improving equipment, improving processes, and increasing production efficiency. Unexpectedly, after three days, the number of big-character posters suddenly decreased, and the masses stopped brainstorming from all angles, causing the rationalization proposal movement to enter a low ebb. At this time, Party Group Leader Qin Fengzhang pointed out the direction at the meeting of Party, government, labor union, and youth league group leaders, advocating combining the current movement with the factory's long-term planning for consideration. Thus, the mass rationalization proposal movement was pushed to a new climax. It was at this time that Zhu Xilin, the labor union group leader, said: "I think we can reverse the order of operations, switch the machine tools used for processing the steering gear housing and the steering gear cover, putting large parts on large machine tools and small parts on small machine tools for processing, then we can produce two hundred and fifty vehicles' worth of parts in one shift.” Many people agreed with this opinion. Qin Fengzhang seized on this revolutionary spark and clearly proposed: "Let's make producing two hundred and fifty vehicles' worth of parts per shift our group's goal, what do you think?" And he reported this bold idea to the Party branch. The Party branch secretary instructed him, saying: "It's good to do it this way, but you need to unify your thinking, and you need to lead everyone to conduct a thorough and meticulous investigation around this direction." After that, a fierce debate against those who reach for things became intense. Tian Ruikang, the deputy administrative group leader, said: "Among the eighteen machine tools in the entire group, fifteen can barely reach a shift output of one hundred vehicles' worth of parts. Without adding equipment or personnel, it’s not likely we can achieve two hundred and fifty vehicles' worth of parts per shift." Some others said: "When the shift output was a hundred vehicles, the output had already doubled. It’s not so easy to achieve two hundred and fifty vehicles' worth of parts without adding equipment!" Ge Shuqi, the Youth League group leader, remained silent, not expressing an opinion, and Zhu Wuxi, the administrative group leader, was also wavering. Qin Fengzhang refuted these erroneous views. He said: "Our initial shift output was fifty vehicles with this many people, and the shift output of one hundred vehicles was also with this many people. Can't we produce more with these pieces of equipment and these people? Besides, the production capacity of some of the existing equipment is already close to two hundred and fifty vehicles' worth of parts. As long as we mobilize the masses to break through the key bottlenecks, the production capacity of other equipment can also be improved. Machines are inanimate, but people are alive. More thinking means more production." Zhu Wuxi thought that what he said was correct, and that he should not waver. After the meeting, Qin Fengzhang said to Tian Ruikang and Ge Shuqi: "Everyone has already put forward so many good ideas, and we haven't even tried them yet. How can we say it can't be done?" This increased the confidence of several group leaders.

After this intense debate, the enthusiasm of the workers throughout the group for leaping forward to a shift output of two hundred and fifty vehicles' worth of parts was ignited. They progressed from improving equipment and processes to changing product structure. They observed several different types of cars and found that the connecting pipes of the steering gear housings of various cars were of different lengths. Shortening it by fifty millimeters could save forty tons of steel per year for this process and reduce processing time by one-third. But as soon as they mentioned modifying the product design, everyone fell silent; because such a modification would require changing the car's structure, modifying a large number of production equipment, dies, and fixtures, and changing the entire factory's design. Such a big problem could only be approved by higher authorities. Moreover, this was a problem that workers had never encountered before. Qin Fengzhang reported this situation to the workshop, and the workshop director also felt that changing the product design was a major event related to the factory's entire automobile production and hesitated somewhat. This workshop was Factory Director Rao Bin's "experimental field". When he asked Factory Director Rao Bin while the Factory Director was visiting the "experimental field": "Can workers' suggestions for modifying product design work?" The Factory Director was very excited to see that the workers had expanded the scope of tapping potential from improving equipment and processing methods to changing the product structure, and were leaping forward in the direction of independently designing new cars. He believed that workers had developed from participating in the factory's daily management to demanding to participate in the factory's design and technical leadership, which was the sprout of moving towards communism; he encouraged the workers, saying: "Automobile parts can be moved, and process routes can be changed, as long as they meet the requirements of achieving more, faster, better, and more economically." Seeing that the Factory Director was very supportive, the workshop director instructed the Steering Gear Housing Group: Be clear about the key points, take concrete measures, and figure out what key bottlenecks still exist in achieving a shift output of two hundred and fifty vehicles' worth of parts, and how to break through them? The Party organizations and administrative leaders throughout the factory also mobilized design and process personnel to go deep into the site and discuss with the workers.

At this time, the workers became even bolder and more enthusiastic. Some workers said: "We haven't been able to fully exert ourselves for the past two years, but this time we can solve the problem!" They discussed during the day and drew designs at night. Several group leaders moved to the workshop, and they spent all day holding parts and product drawings, inspecting and recording item by item, process by process, machine tool by machine tool, and then discussed and finally formulated a plan for a shift output of two hundred and fifty vehicles' worth of parts based on three no-adds (no adding equipment, no adding people, no adding workshop area) and three turn-ins (turning in three machine tools, three workers, and twenty-one square meters of workshop area).

But to achieve this plan, it was necessary to break through six barriers. What to do? The engineer advocated removing two low-efficiency machine tools and adding two high-efficiency machine tools. He believed that this was still cost-effective. Because the production efficiency was increased four times by only changing two machine tools, without increasing equipment. But Qin Fengzhang and Zhu Wuxi jointly considered: Although the number of equipment would not increase in this way, it would require the state to invest two or three thousand yuan, and ordering goods from foreign factories would not put them into production until a year later, so they firmly opposed this opinion. They advocated breaking through the six barriers by improving existing equipment, merging processes, increasing the depth of cut, and increasing the speed. The engineer believed that this would violate process requirements and could not agree under any circumstances. But the workers insisted on trying it out. The two sides argued red-faced.

Soon, the workshop director and the Party branch secretary both asked Qin Fengzhang with concern: "Can you contract to break through these six barriers yourselves?" He replied very firmly: "We will definitely contract to break through them, and guarantee that we will break through the six barriers in seven days of hard work!" They started experimenting right away. One of the six key barriers was the hexagonal lathe for processing the steering gear housing. This machine tool originally took twenty minutes to process one part. When the shift output was one hundred vehicles, the workers improved it to five minutes each, so some workers believed that the efficiency of this machine tool had reached its peak. Lao Qin believed that this was the first barrier, and as long as the first barrier was broken, the other five barriers would be easy to break through. At first, he increased the speed from 233 revolutions per minute to 322 revolutions per minute, which increased production efficiency somewhat, but it still did not reach the shift output of two hundred and fifty vehicles' worth of parts. Lao Qin was not discouraged and stared at the cutting tool for several hours. Still, there was no improvement. Lao Qin was immersed in hard thinking... At this time, he remembered the merging process of processing oil pumps in the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, and he understood and merged the four stations into two stations, using combined cutting tools for processing. As a result, it took one minute and forty seconds to process a steering gear housing, and the shift output of parts increased from one hundred and twenty vehicles' worth of parts to two hundred and sixty vehicles' worth of parts. The product quality was also improved. Lao Qin broke through the first barrier. Because of overwork, his body temperature increased, blisters appeared on his lips, and his throat was hoarse and speechless. He did not rest but went with Zhu Wuxi to experiment with another multi-tool semi-automatic lathe. He did not expect this to be an even more difficult barrier. Fang Chusheng, the young worker who operated this machine tool, prepared the cutting tools and tools for the experiment early in the morning on Sunday. Under the watch of the workers in the entire group, Lao Qin started the machine tool at a high speed of 600 revolutions per minute. Purple-blue iron filings, with white smoke, continuously flew out. However, Qin Fengzhang used high-speed cutting, and the processing time for each steering arm shaft was only five seconds less than before, failing to meet the requirement of a shift output of two hundred and fifty vehicles' worth of parts. At this time, Xiao Fang was very anxious. Lao Qin then changed to knife cutting and increased the feed from 0.23 to 0.71. The experimental results showed that the production efficiency was doubled compared to the original, and the shift output exceeded two hundred and fifty vehicles' worth of parts. At this time, Xiao Fang, who had been feeling heavy-hearted, jumped up happily, and everyone's face showed the joy of victory. Finally, the all-steel boring machine experimented with by Tian Ruikang had not reached 250 after several days and nights of hard work. This machine tool had high precision. Because the processed part was long, the boring bar vibrated, and the number of products always failed to increase. More than twenty experiments failed. Qin Fengzhang said: "Don't be discouraged even if the experiment fails a thousand times!" Everyone was encouraged by the fact that Lao Qin had broken through one barrier after another and concentrated their firepower on this machine tool. As a result, Tian Ruikang, based on the suggestion of the design office, tried to use hard alloy instead of the vibration damper, overcoming the vibration problem of the boring bar. The hole-boring efficiency also jumped from one hundred and thirty to two hundred and eighty. The six key barriers were broken through, and the production capacity of the eighteen machine tools all reached and exceeded the requirement of a shift output of two hundred and fifty vehicles' worth of automobiles. At this time, the engineer who had originally held opposing views was also present. When he saw this result with his own eyes, he couldn't help but say to Qin Fengzhang: "You guys are really something!"

The factory's Party committee believed that the Steering Gear Housing Group's initiative was a huge revolutionary act in production. Whether it could be done throughout the factory needed to be carefully studied and gradually tested. After testing in one or two workshops, this red flag was raised high. A mass movement on a large scale "workers participate in design, carry out technical revolution in a big way, and leap forward to a shift output of two hundred and fifty vehicles' worth of automobiles" swept the factory like a huge wave. All the employees of the factory marched forward by leaps and bounds... The battle results chart showed that one-third of the production teams in the factory had reached the production capacity of a shift output of two hundred and fifty vehicles' worth of automobiles.

Having reached the level of a shift output of two hundred and fifty vehicles' worth of automobiles, with production capacity increased fivefold, has it reached the peak, and should we rest for a while? Some comrades replied: "There is no peak in innovation, and the pace of progress cannot be stopped," and advocated setting new goals and leaping forward to a shift output of three hundred vehicles' worth of automobiles. But some people lacked confidence, believing that it took a lot of effort to just reach two hundred and fifty vehicles' worth of automobiles, and immediately going to three hundred vehicles' worth of automobiles would be premature.

They adopted the old method, debating and studying on the one hand, and delving into accounting on the other, clarifying from the debate that they should continue to advance and strive for the top in accordance with the direction pointed out by the Party. In accounting, they analyzed the potential of each machine tool based on the requirement of a shift output of three hundred vehicles' worth of automobiles. According to the calculation, ten machine tools had already exceeded the shift output of two hundred and fifty vehicles' worth of automobiles and were close to three hundred vehicles' worth of automobiles, and could completely leap forward with slight improvements. One key milling machine originally wanted to increase the speed, but they were afraid that the vibration would be too great and the tool would not be able to withstand it. Later, the workers made an indigenous milling machine to replace it, and the production capacity could reach a shift output of five hundred vehicles' worth of automobiles. The accounting results showed that only seven machine tools could not reach three hundred vehicles' worth of automobiles for the time being, but all had the possibility of continued innovation and potential to be tapped. With unified thinking, they looked for the key to each of these seven machine tools, discussed the direction and measures for innovation, formulated an innovation plan for achieving a shift output of three hundred vehicles' worth of automobiles, and quickly took action. Now three machine tools have reached three hundred vehicles' worth of automobiles under everyone's research.

Lao Qin said: This once again tells us that progress accounts should be calculated frequently, and the more you calculate, the more confident you will be. Only by constantly proposing new indicators based on accounting can you have new goals and encourage everyone to always strive for the top. Now the thinking of the workers in our group has completely changed, and they no longer just work according to drawings. Everyone is racking their brains whenever they have time to think about ways to innovate. You think, all of the eighteen of the most modern machine tools have been improved. In the face of this fact, who can still believe that modern equipment cannot be further advanced? Who can still believe that the potential has been fully tapped and that innovation has reached its peak? I believe that with continuous progress in thinking, production will certainly continue to rise sharply.

    工人也能设计
    记第一汽车厂转向器壳小组工人改变设计提高工效的事迹
    在到处充满着社会主义建设凯歌的1958年，第一汽车制造厂的底盘车间转向工部转向器壳小组的钢梁上，挂出一面用“卫星”命名的红旗。它像东升的太阳普照着全厂，染红了几万颗汽车工人的心！
    1958年的元月，厂长饶斌在全厂职工代表大会上，报告了工厂的远景规划，转向器壳小组的朱武喜听了十分兴奋。他在回车间的路上，一面走一面海阔天空地想：“将来汽车每年生产到几十万辆，我们的工厂该扩大到多少倍呀！这样厂区围墙拆掉，职工宿舍移到离工厂更远的地方，工人上班，电车也不顶事了，都得乘火车了……”。一个宏伟无比的汽车厂，在朱武喜的脑子里展现出来。可是他又觉得，这样想是不符合多快好省的精神的。
    不几天，厂部根据市委的指示，围绕着查生产（查生产管理、产品设计、设备潜力、规章制度）向全厂职工进行了动员。运动很快在转向器壳小组展开了。短短的三天里，十八个工人就贴出了二百九十张大字报，党小组长秦凤章和行政组长朱武喜看到工人提出了很多改进设备、改进工艺、提高生产效率的建议，都很高兴。不料三天后大字报突然减少了，群众不再从各方面去打主意，合理化建议转入低潮。这时，党小组长秦凤章，在党政工团小组长碰头会上指出了方向，主张把当前运动与工厂远景规划，结合起来考虑。于是把群众的合理化建议运动，又推向高潮。就在这时，工会小组长朱喜林说：“我看颠倒一下工序，把转向器壳和转向汽测盖，换一换机床加工，大零件放到大机床上，小零件放到小机床上加工，一班就能生产二百五十辆分。”很多人都同意这个意见。秦凤章抓住了这个有革命意义的苗头，明确地提出：“把班产二百五十辆分，作为我们全组的奋斗方向，大家看行不行？”并把这个大胆的想法，汇报到党支部。支部书记指示他说：“这样作很好，但要统一思想，要围绕这个方向，领导大家深入细致的查。”之后，一场反对伸手派的大辩论，就猛烈的展开了。行政副组长田瑞康说：“全组十八台机床中，有十五台勉强可以达到班产一百辆，要不增添设备，不给人，实现班产二百五十辆分，我看没有把握？”还有的人说：“班产百辆时，产量已加一倍，不添设备实现二百五十辆分，那有这么便宜的事！”团小组长葛淑奇，闷声不响，不表示态度，行政组长朱武喜也摇摆不定。秦凤章反驳了这些错误的看法。他说：“我们最初班产五十辆，是这么多人，班产一百辆也是这么多人，难道用这些设备，这些人，就不能生产得更多吗？何况现有几台设备，已接近二百五十辆分，别的设备只要发动群众突破关键，生产能力也可以提高上去。机器是死的，人可是活的，多想办法，就能多生产。”朱武喜一听这些话说得很对，觉得自己不该动摇。会后秦凤章对田瑞康和葛淑奇说：“大家已经提出了这么多的好办法，还没有试验，我们怎能说不行呢？”这样几个小组长的信心都提高了。
    经过这场激烈的争论，全组工人向班产二百五十辆分跃进的劲头鼓起来了。他们从改进设备，改进工艺发展到改变产品结构。他们观察了数种不同类型的汽车，发现各种汽车转向器壳的连接管，长短不同，只要把它缩短五十方米，一年就可以使这个工序节省四十吨钢材，减少三分之一的加工时间。可是一提修改产品设计，大家就闷了；因为这么一改，汽车结构要动，大批的生产设备和冲模夹具要改，整个工厂设计都要变更，这样大的问题，非得上级批准不可。况且这又是工人向来不曾接触过的问题。秦凤章又把这个情况汇报到工部，工部主任也觉得改产品设计是关系全厂汽车生产的大事，有些犹豫。这个工部是厂长饶斌的“试验田”。在厂长参加“试验田”的时候，他问饶厂长：“工人建议修改产品设计，这能行吗？”厂长看到工人已经把挖潜力的范围，从改进设备，改进加工方法，扩大到改变产品结构，向着独立设计新汽车的方向跃进，非常兴奋。他认为：工人已经从参加工厂的日常管理，发展到要求参加工厂设计和技术领导了，这是迈向共产主义的萌芽；他鼓励工人说：“汽车零件可以动，工艺路线可以改，只要符合多快好省的要求。”工部主任看到厂长很支持，就指示转向器壳小组：要关键明确，措施具体，弄清实现班产二百五十辆分，还有那些关键，怎样攻破？全厂党组织和行政领导也发动设计、工艺人员深入现场和工人一起讨论。
    这时工人胆量更大，劲头更足了。有的工人说：“这两年放不开劲，这回可解决问题了！”他们白天讨论，晚间画图设计，几个小组长都搬到车间来，他们整天拿着零件和产品图纸，按每个零件，每道工序，每台机床，逐项检查记录，研究、讨论，最后制订出三不加（不加设备、不加人、不加作业面积）和三上缴（三台机床、三个工人、二十一平方米作业面积）班产二百五十辆分的方案。
    但是要实现这个方案，还要突破六关。怎么办呢？工程师主张去掉两台低效率机床，增加两台高效率的机床。他认为这还是合算的。因为生产效率提高四倍只调换两台机床，并没有增加设备。但是秦凤章和朱武喜一合计：这样设备数量虽然没有增加，却需要国家投资两、三万元，而且去外厂订货，要一年以后才能投入生产，便坚决反对这种意见。他们主张从改进现有设备，合并工序，增大进刀量，提高车速等方面去闯过六关。工程师认为这样会违反工艺要求，无论如何不能同意。但工人一定要试验一下。双方争论得面红耳赤。
    不久，车间主任和党总支书记都很关切地问秦凤章：“这六关你们自己能包下来吗？”他很坚定地回答：“我们一定包下来，保证苦战七天过六关！”说干就干，他们就试验起来。六个关键中有一关，是加工转向器壳的六角车床。这台机床原来要二十分钟加工一个零件。在班产百辆时，经过工人改进，达到五分钟一个，因此有的工人认为这台机床的效率到顶了。老秦认为这是第一关，只要打破头一关，其他五关就容易闯过。开始他把车速由每分钟二百三十三转提高到三百二十二转，生产效率提高一些，还达不到班产二百五十辆分。老秦没有灰心，一连几个小时眼巴巴地盯住车刀。还是没有提高。老秦沉浸在苦思苦想中……这时，他想起在上海柴油机厂加工油泵合并工序，心里开了窍，把四个工位并成两个工位，采用组合刀量加工，结果用一分四十秒加工一个转向器壳，班产零件由一百二十辆分增到二百六十辆分。产品质量也提高了，老秦冲破了第一关。因为过度疲劳，体温增高，咀唇起了泡，嗓子也哑得说不出话。他没有休息，又和朱武喜去试验另一台多刀半自动车床。没有想到这是更为困难的一关。操作这台机床的青年工人方初生，星期天一清早，就把试验用的刀具、工具，准备妥当，老秦在全组工人的注视下，以每分钟六百转的高速，开动了机床，紫蓝色的铁屑，带着白烟，接连不断地向外飞卷。但是秦凤章采用高速切削，每个转向臂轴加工时间，只比原来少五秒钟，达不到班产二百五十的要求。这时小方很着急。老秦又改用刀切削，把走刀量由零点二三加大到零点七一，试验结果，生产效率比原来提高一倍，班产量超过了二百五十辆分。这时心情沉重的小方，高兴得跳起来，每个人脸上，都露出了胜利的喜悦。最后，田瑞康试验的全钢镗床，经过几昼夜的苦战，还没有达到二百五十。这台机床精度很高，由于加工零件长，镗杆产生震荡，产品数量总是上不去，试验二十多次都失败了。秦凤章说：“试验一千次不成功也不要灰心！”大家从老秦闯过的一关又一关的事实中，得到了鼓舞，把火力都集中到这台机床上，结果田瑞康根据设计处的建议试用硬质合金代替作减震器，克服了镗杆震动的毛病。镗孔效率，也由一百三十个跳到二百八十个。六个关键被攻破了，十八台机床的生产能力，全部达到和超过了班产二百五十辆分汽车的要求，这时，原来那个持反对意见的工程师也在场，他亲眼看到这个结果，不禁对秦凤章说：“你们就是行啊！”
    工厂党委认为：转向器壳小组的创举，是生产上巨大的革命行为，能不能全厂都作到，要认真研究，逐步试验。在一两个工部试验之后，就高举这面红旗。一个“工人参加设计，大闹技术革命，向班产二百五十辆分汽车跃进”大规模的群众运动，势如万丈波涛，席卷全厂。全厂职工在大踏步地前进了。……战果表上表示出：全厂已有三分之一的生产小组达到了班产二百五十辆分汽车的生产能力。
    达到了班产二百五十辆分的水平，生产能力翻了五番，是不是就到了顶点呢，是不是应该休息一下了呢？有的同志回答说：“革新没有顶，前进脚步不能停下来”，主张提新的目标，向班产三百辆分高飞猛进。但是也有人信心不足，认为费了很大的劲刚刚才达到二百五十辆分，马上又搞三百辆分，是不是过早了呢？
    他们采用老办法，一面辩论研究，一面深入算账，从辩论中明确了应该按照党所指出的方向，继续前进，再争上游。在算账当中，他们根据班产三百辆分的要求，分析了每台机床的潜力。一算有十台机床已经过了班产二百五十辆分，接近三百辆分，只要稍加改进，完全可以跃上去。有一台关键铣床，原想提高转速，但怕震动太大，刀具受不了，后来工人制造了一台土铣床来代替，生产能力可以达到班产五百辆分。算账的结果，只有七台机床暂时达不到三百辆分，但都有继续革新的可能，都有潜力可挖。思想统一了，他们就寻找这七台机床的每台的关键，讨论出革新的方向和措施，订出了实现班产三百辆分的革新规划，并且迅速行动起来，现在已经有三台机床在大家研究下达到了三百辆分。
    老秦说：这又一次告诉我们，跃进账要经常算，越算心中越有底。在算账基础上不断提出新指标，才有新的奋斗目标，才能鼓舞大家永远力争上游。现在我们组里工人思想全变了，不再光是凭图纸干活了，每个人都是一有空就在动脑筋，想革新门路。你想，十八台最近代化的机床台台都有了改进，在这个事实面前，谁还能相信近代的设备不可以再跃进呢？谁还能相信潜力已经挖光，革新已经到顶了呢？我相信，思想不断前进，生产也一定会继续高涨。
