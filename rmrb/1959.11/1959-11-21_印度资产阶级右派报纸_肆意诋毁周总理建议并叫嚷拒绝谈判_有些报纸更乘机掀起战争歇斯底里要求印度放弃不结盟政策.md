Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 20th: News from New Delhi: After Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Prime Minister Nehru on November 7th was published, Indian bourgeois right-wing newspapers wantonly vilified Premier Zhou's reasonable suggestions for avoiding border conflicts and holding a meeting between the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers, clamoring for a refusal to negotiate with China. They attempted to maintain the tense Sino-Indian situation in the long term by inciting an anti-China movement.

Several major English newspapers in India launched a major offensive against Premier Zhou's proposal on November 11th as if directed by a magic wand.

The "Indian Express" editorial on the 11th, in addition to continuing to repeat the slander that China had occupied Indian territory, nakedly exposed its hostility towards Sino-Indian friendship and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It said: "The saying that 'India and China are brothers' has long been dead. The Panchsheel is also long dead." This newspaper demanded that Nehru refuse negotiations. It said that if Nehru "insists on risking talking to that gentleman again... then he will be responsible not only to future generations but also to India today." The "Hindustan Times" clamored that "the answer to Zhou Enlai's invitation to hold negotiations must be a firm and unequivocal 'no'." It vilified Premier Zhou's proposal as an "absurd and arrogant proposal," a "trap," and an attempt to "deceive us (India)."

Right-wing newspapers also tried their best to spread the idea that negotiations would be fruitless. "The Statesman" editorial on the 12th said, "The general feeling today is one of doubled suspicion... India has reason to suspect whether making even the smallest concessions now will be used against itself in the future." The "Times of India" described Premier Zhou's proposed negotiations as "immature" and "bound to be lengthy and fruitless."

Indian right-wing newspapers put forward a common absurd argument against negotiations: accepting Premier Zhou's proposal for negotiations would mean acknowledging the so-called "Chinese occupation of Indian territory" and would be a sign of "weakness and surrender." A commentary in "The Statesman" on the 11th said that "China's proposal is to normalize the fact of Chinese aggression in Aksai Chin and other areas of Ladakh." The "Indian Express" also said that "if this proposal is accepted, it will allow the Chinese to occupy territory approximately forty miles deep and thousands of square miles in area." The "Times of India" also made the excuse that if this plan were implemented on the so-called McMahon Line, "the terrain would be in their (China's) favor."

After the incident in which Indian armed personnel invaded the area south of the Kongka Pass in China and carried out armed provocations, these newspapers continuously published editorials, articles, and published cartoons and maps, slandering China as an "aggressor," "Han expansionism and communist imperialism," and the "Yellow Peril," etc.

The "Times of India," in its October 28th editorial, advocated severing relations between China and India, saying, "However regrettable it may be, it is indeed necessary to consider the possibility of severing diplomatic relations with Communist China." The "Hindustan Standard," in its October 26th editorial, attacked Nehru, saying, "The country may not have many more opportunities to unanimously support him." The newspaper demanded that Nehru reformulate his policy towards China and take "retaliatory action" against China. Batia, the editor of "The Tribune," wrote in a commentary on October 27th, demanding: First, India must "immediately stop promoting friendship with China around the world"; second, replace Defense Minister Menon.

Some newspapers even more frantically incited war hysteria, clamoring for war with China. Mankikar, the editor of the Delhi edition of the "Indian Express," published an article on October 28th, demanding war with China and taking "resolute punitive action." Moolgaokar, the editor of the "Hindustan Times," said in a commentary on October 28th, "Our aversion to war may deceive us into a situation where the war we do not want becomes inevitable." He accused Nehru of "taking a routine approach to national security issues."

The "Eastern Economist," the mouthpiece of Indian big capitalists, clamored on October 30th to send a large number of Indian troops to the Ladakh front. This publication demanded that Nehru "reorganize the cabinet and formulate diplomatic and military plans that conform to the new situation." It threatened that if he failed to do so, "there would be a danger that even within his own (Congress) party there would be serious objections to his leadership."

Some right-wing newspapers took the opportunity to demand that India's economy be turned to militarization. The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" said that India needed to "transfer its resources from construction projects to defense." The "Hindustan Times" also made a demand in its November 7th editorial for civilian industries to participate in "the idea of manufacturing munitions and equipment."

Some pro-American, reactionary newspapers also took the opportunity to demand that India abandon its non-aligned policy, advocating that India accept Western military assistance. The pro-American "Glory" openly said, "There is no other way but to accept military assistance to drive out the Chinese." Mankikar demanded in the "Indian Express" that the Indian government "abandon the Panchsheel" and "accept military assistance from non-communist countries ready to help us." He demanded that Nehru "fundamentally change our thinking on foreign and defense policies." He said, "The stage where our rulers still hoped to piece together the shattered Panchsheel policy is over. It is now too damaged to be repaired." He said, "Common sense requires us to seek allies and friends who share our defense concerns. Non-alignment has lost its meaning, and we have adhered to this policy to the point where our own security is endangered."

The proposal for "Indo-Pakistan joint defense" under US support, which had been widely condemned by people from all walks of life in India, has once again become the topic of right-wing newspapers. The "Indian Express" of October 28th demanded that India "sign a non-aggression treaty with Pakistan, and then sign a joint defense treaty." This newspaper said, "At this critical juncture in our relations with China, there is an urgent need to consolidate understanding with our neighbors, especially Pakistan. Pakistan is also threatened to a lesser extent by the same side."

The "Hindustan Times" and other newspapers published in a prominent position the news that Eisenhower, who will visit Asia in the future, will "mediate to promote understanding between India and Pakistan."

Indian right-wing newspapers have also launched numerous attacks and accusations against the Communist Party of India along with reactionary political forces. They published the clamoring of reactionary figures: "Ban the Communist Party," "Those who sympathize with China are our enemies," the Indian Communist Party is "loyal to foreign countries," etc.

    印度资产阶级右派报纸
    肆意诋毁周总理建议并叫嚷拒绝谈判
    有些报纸更乘机掀起战争歇斯底里要求印度放弃不结盟政策
    新华社20日讯　新德里消息：印度资产阶级右派报纸在周恩来总理11月7日给尼赫鲁总理的信发表以后，对周总理提出的避免边境冲突和举行中印总理会谈的合理建议大肆诋毁，叫嚣拒绝同中国谈判。它们企图以煽动反华运动来长期保持中印紧张局势。
    印度几家英文大报是在11月11日如同受到一根魔棒指挥一样，一齐对周总理的建议发动大举进攻的。
    “印度快报”11日的社论除继续重复诬蔑中国侵占了印度领土的谰言外，赤裸裸地暴露了它对中印友谊和和平共处五项原则的敌视。它说：“印度中国是兄弟这句话老早已经死亡。潘查希拉也早已死亡。”这家报纸要求尼赫鲁拒绝谈判。它说，如果尼赫鲁“再次坚持要冒险同那位先生谈，……那末他不仅要对后代负责，而且要对今天的印度负责。”“印度斯坦时报”叫嚣说，“对周恩来提出的举行谈判的邀请的答复必须是坚定和毫不含糊的‘不行’。”它诋毁周总理的建议是“荒谬和傲慢的建议”，是“一个圈套”，是要“欺骗我们（印度）”。
    右派报纸还竭力散布谈判不会有结果的空气。“政治家报”12日的社论说，“今天普遍的感觉是加倍怀疑……印度有理由怀疑，现在作出极小的让步将来是否会用来对付它自己。”“印度时报”把周总理建议的谈判说成是“没有成熟的”、“必然是漫长的、毫无结果”的谈判。
    印度右翼报纸提出了一个反对谈判的共同的荒谬论据：接受周总理谈判的建议就意味着承认所谓“中国对印度领土的占领”，是“软弱和投降”。11日“政治家报”的评论中说，“中国建议是要把中国在阿克赛和拉达克其他地区的侵略的事实正常化。”“印度快报”也说什么“如果接受这个建议，就会使中国人占据我们深约四十英里、面积达数千平方英里的领土”。“印度时报”还借口说，如在所谓麦克马洪线实行这个计划，“地势对他们（中国）有利”。
    这些报纸在印度武装人员侵入中国空喀山口以南地区进行武装挑衅事件发生后，就连续发表社论、文章、刊登漫画、地图，诬蔑中国是“侵略者”、“汉族扩张主义和共产帝国主义”、“黄祸”等等。
    “印度时报”在10月28日的社论中鼓吹中印绝交，它说，“无论怎样令人遗憾，的确有必要考虑同共产党中国断绝外交关系的可能性。”“印度斯坦旗报”在10月26日的社论中攻击尼赫鲁说，“这个国家一致支持他的机会可能不多了。”报纸要求尼赫鲁重新制定对中国的政策，对中国采取“报复行动”。“论坛报”主编巴蒂亚在10月27日写的一篇评论中要求：第一步，印度必须“立即停止在世界各地促进同中国的友谊”，第二步，撤换国防部长梅农。
    有些报纸更疯狂地煽动战争歇斯底里，叫嚣同中国作战。“印度快报”德里版主编曼基卡尔10月28日发表文章，要求对中国作战，采取“坚决的惩罚行动”。“印度斯坦时报”主编穆尔岗卡10月28日在一篇评论中说，“我们对战争的厌恶可能使我们受骗而处于这样一种情况：使我们所不希望的战争成为不可避免的。”他指责尼赫鲁“对国家安全问题采取因循态度”。
    印度大资本家的喉舌“东方经济学家”10月30日叫嚣要把大批印度军队派往拉达克前线。这家刊物要求尼赫鲁“改组内阁，并且拟订符合新形势的外交和军事计划”。它威胁说，如果他做不到这一点，“那么就会出现这样的危险：即使在他自己的（国大）党内，对他的领导也会有严重的异议。”
    有些右派报纸趁机要求把印度的经济转到军事化方面来。“甘露市场报”说，印度需要“把它的资源从建设工程上转移到防御方面来”。“印度斯坦时报”在11月7日的社论中也提出要求民用工业参加“制造军火和装备的主张”。
    一些亲美的、反动的报纸也趁机要求印度放弃不结盟政策，鼓吹印度接受西方军事援助。亲美的“荣耀报”公开说，“除了接受军事援助来赶走中国人以外，没有别的办法。”曼基卡尔在“印度快报”上要求印度政府“放弃潘查希拉”，并且“接受准备援助我们的非共产党国家的军事援助。”他要求尼赫鲁“根本改变我们在外交和国防政策方面的想法”。他说，“我们的统治者仍然希望把撕得粉碎的潘查希拉政策凑起来的阶段已经过去。它现在已被破坏得无法修补了。”他说，“常识要求我们必须寻找与我们有共同防御问题的盟国和朋友。不结盟已经失去了它的意义，我们一直坚持了这种政策，坚持到使我们自己的安全遭到危险的程度。”
    曾经受到印度各阶层人民广泛斥责的在美国支持下搞“印巴联防”的主张，又成为右派报纸大做文章的题目。10月28日的“印度快报”要求印度“同巴基斯坦签订互不侵犯条约，然后签订联合防御条约。”这家报纸说，“在我国同中国关系的这个紧急关头，迫切需要巩固同我们邻国特别是巴基斯坦的谅解。巴基斯坦在较小程度上也受到来自同一方面的相同威胁。”
    “印度斯坦时报”和另外一些报纸以显著的地位刊登了这种消息：将来亚洲访问的艾森豪威尔将“进行斡旋来促成印度和巴基斯坦的谅解”。
    印度右派报纸还同反动政党势力一道对印度共产党发出大量的攻击和指责。它们刊登反动角色的叫嚷：“禁止共产党”，“同情中国的那些人是我们的敌人”，印度共产党“效忠外国”等等。
