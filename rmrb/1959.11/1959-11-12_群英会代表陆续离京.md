(Xinhua News Agency, November 11th) Today, the newly built Beijing Railway Station was filled with the sounds of gongs and drums and colorful flags were flying. The heroes from all walks of life who attended the National Model Workers' Congress have begun to leave Beijing successively to return to their work posts. After warmly receiving them, the people of the capital are now bidding them farewell with reluctance.

After the closing of the Model Workers' Congress, many delegations held discussion meetings to summarize the gains from attending the congress and discuss measures to implement the spirit of the congress upon their return.

The All-China Women's Federation, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the China Democratic League, the Chinese Artists Association, the Ministry of Light Industry, the General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Ministry of Public Security, among other units, have all convened座谈会 or held joint gatherings with relevant representatives who attended the Model Workers' Congress in recent days. At these meetings, the heads of the various departments had cordial conversations with the representatives, encouraging them to maintain their glory, guard against arrogance, and always be standard bearers of the Great Leap Forward.
