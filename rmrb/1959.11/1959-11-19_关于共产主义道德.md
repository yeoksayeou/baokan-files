    About Communist Morality
    ·Quotations·

    The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that its development involves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.
                    (Marx & Engels: "The Communist Manifesto")

    Only in a society where class antagonisms have not merely been overcome but have been forgotten in practical life, where the petty bickerings of everyday existence no longer obscure the historical vision, will it be possible to have a truly human morality which stands above class antagonisms and their legacies.
                                (Engels: "Anti-Dühring")

    Our morality is entirely subordinate to the interests of the proletariat's class struggle. Our morality is derived from the interests of the proletariat's class struggle.
    The entire morality of the Communists lies in this united discipline and the conscious mass struggle against the exploiters. We do not believe in eternal morality and expose all the deceptive nonsense about morality. Morality can help human society rise to a higher level and free it from the system of labor exploitation.
    Struggling to consolidate and complete the cause of communism is the foundation of communist morality.
                            (Lenin: "The Tasks of the Youth Leagues")

    The development of material aspects, the development of external conditions, precedes the development of ideas, precedes the development of consciousness: first, external conditions change, first, material aspects change, and then consciousness and ideas change accordingly.
    History shows that people in different eras hold different thoughts and desires because they struggle with nature in different ways to satisfy their needs in different eras. Correspondingly, their economic relations are also formed in various different ways. There was a period when people struggled together with nature on the basis of primitive communism. At that time, their ownership was also communist, so they hardly distinguished between "mine" and "yours," and their consciousness was communist. Later, the distinction between "mine" and "yours" permeated production, so ownership became private, that is, individualistic, and people's consciousness was permeated with a sense of private property. Now, production is socialized again, so ownership will soon be socialized. Precisely because of this, people's consciousness is gradually being permeated with socialist ideas.
            (Stalin: "Anarchism or Socialism?")

    We should all learn from his spirit of utter selflessness. Starting from this point, one can become a person greatly beneficial to the people. A person may be great or small in ability, but as long as one possesses this spirit, one is a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who is free from vulgar interests, and a person who is beneficial to the people.
                              (Mao Zedong: "In Memory of Norman Bethune")

    Building one's own happiness on the basis of "making others suffer" is a common characteristic of all exploiters. Sacrificing the happiness of all mankind or the vast majority of people, reducing all mankind or the vast majority of the people to starvation, cold, and humiliation in order to create special rights and special enjoyment for individuals or a small number of people, this is the foundation of the "nobility," "greatness," and "respect" of all exploiters, the foundation of the morality of all exploiters.
    The proletariat and the Communists are the opposite. They build their own happiness on the basis of "making others share happiness." They liberate themselves in the struggle for the liberation of the vast majority of working people and all mankind, and eliminate the special rights of a minority. This is the foundation of the nobility, greatness, and respect of the Communists, the foundation of Communist morality.
                    (Liu Shaoqi: "On the Self-Cultivation of a Communist")

    关于共产主义道德
    ·语录·
    共产主义革命就是要最坚决地打破过去传下来的所有制关系；所以，毫不奇怪，它在自己的发展进程中要最坚决地打破过去传下来的各种观念。
                    （马克思、恩格斯：“共产党宣言”）
    只有在不仅消灭了阶级对立、而且在生活实践中忘记了阶级对立的社会阶段上，超越于阶级对立及其回忆之上的真正人类的道德，方才成为可能。
                                （恩格斯：“反杜林论”）
    我们的道德完全服从无产阶级阶级斗争的利益。我们的道德是从无产阶级阶级斗争的利益中引伸出来的。
    共产主义者的全部道德就在于这种团结一致的纪律和反对剥削者的自觉的群众斗争，我们不相信有永恒不变的道德，并且要揭穿一切关于道德的骗人的鬼话。道德能帮助人类社会升到更高的水平，使人类社会摆脱劳动剥削制。
    为巩固和完成共产主义事业而斗争，这就是共产主义道德的基础。
                            （列宁：“青年团的任务”）
    物质方面的发展　外部条件的发展，先于观念方面的发展，先于意识的发展：首先是外部条件发生变化，首先是物质方面发生变化，然后意识、观念方面才相应地发生变化。
    历史表明：各种不同时代的人们之所以抱有各种不同的思想和愿望，是由于人们在不同的时代用不同的方式和自然作斗争以求满足本身的需要，与此相适应，他们的经济关系也按各种不同的方式形成起来。有一个时期，人们在原始共产主义的基础上共同和自然作斗争，当时他们的所有制也是共产主义的，因而他们几乎不分“我的”和“你的”，他们的意识是共产主义的。后来生产中浸透了“我的”和“你的”之间的分别，于是所有制也就具有了私有性，即个人主义的性质，人们的意识中也就浸透了私有感。到了现在这个时期，生产又具有社会性，因而所有制也将很快地具有社会性，正因为如此，人们的意识也就逐渐浸透着社会主义思想。
            （斯大林：“无政府主义还是社会主义？”）
    我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这一点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。
                              （毛泽东：“纪念白求恩”）
    把自己的幸福筑在“使别人受痛苦”的基础上，是一切剥削者的共同特点。牺牲全人类或大多数人的幸福，把全人类或最大多数人民弄到饥寒交迫与被侮辱的地位，来造成个人或少数人们特殊的权利与特殊的享受，这就是一切剥削者的“高贵”“伟大”与“被人尊敬”的基础，一切剥削者的道德的基础。
    无产阶级与共产党员就与此相反，是把自己的幸福建筑在“使别人同享幸福”的基础上。是在努力于最大多数劳动人民与全人类的解放斗争中来解放自己，来消灭少数人的特殊权利，这就是共产党员的高贵、伟大与被人尊敬的基础，共产主义的道德的基础。
                    （刘少奇：“论共产党员的修养”）
