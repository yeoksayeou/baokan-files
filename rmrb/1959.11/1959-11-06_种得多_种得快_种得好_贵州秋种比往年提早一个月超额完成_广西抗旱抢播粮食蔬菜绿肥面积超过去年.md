Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, November 5th: This year, Guizhou Province's autumn planting work was completed a month earlier than in previous years, exceeding targets. Wheat planting reached 6,020,000 mu, exceeding the plan by 20.5% and increasing by 82% compared to last year. Rapeseed planting reached 6,230,000 mu, exceeding the plan by 3.8% and more than doubling compared to last year. The planting area for other miscellaneous grains also exceeded the plan. Many regions that started early and progressed quickly have already moved into field management work.

This year's success in planting more, faster, better, and more economically vividly demonstrates the superiority of the People's Communes. The People's Communes uniformly arrange labor, organize cooperation, and widely use various new and improved farm tools. The machinery factories and farm tool factories of many communes have played a significant role in the autumn planting. The machinery factory of the Yaxi People's Commune has manufactured 110,000 pieces of farm tools, large and small, in the past year, including more than 7,000 new and improved farm tools for the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, plowing and sowing). This has greatly improved labor efficiency and accelerated the autumn planting speed. The collective welfare undertakings organized by the communes have provided strong support for accelerating the autumn planting speed. All 851 public canteens in Wangmo County have adopted the method of delivering meals to the mountains or moving stoves to the construction sites, saving a large amount of labor time.

During the autumn planting, all communes and teams cultivated high-yield fields, high-yield slopes, and high-yield ditches of varying sizes. All regions paid special attention to the quality of autumn planting. The CPC Committee of Tongren Special District organized an autumn planting inspection team of 83,000 leading cadres, youths, women, and experienced farmers at all levels. They went deep into the fields to conduct on-site inspections of autumn planting. Some regions established inspection organizations at each level, inspecting and accepting at each level, summarizing advanced experiences, and setting up pacesetters to create a lively red flag competition. Through the red flag competition, 72 people's communes in the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture brought a new atmosphere of "three highs" and "three mores" to the countryside: high political enthusiasm of commune members, high production enthusiasm, and high labor efficiency; more cadres participating in production, more commune members attending work, and more advanced deeds. As a result of the two-day competition in Tongren County, 1,249 pacesetters emerged whose labor efficiency was equivalent to that of two people.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, November 5th: Guangxi is vigorously carrying out mass movements, and winter planting is progressing quickly and well. The province has now planted more than 5,100,000 mu of various crops such as grain, vegetables, and green manure, accounting for 47.7% of the planned area, equivalent to four and a half times that of the same period last year. Rong'an, Liucheng and other twelve counties have taken the lead and have already exceeded this year's winter planting plan. Hechi County has planted more than 40,000 mu of wheat, generally after two plowing and three harrowing, with deep plowing of more than six inches, applying 51 dan of fertilizer per mu, and most of it has been selected with limewater or saltwater. Many areas in Baise Special District have changed the original extensive cultivation habits of not plowing, harrowing, or fertilizing in winter planting, and have generally broken the soil to create ridges and applied sufficient base fertilizer. Winter planting in Liuzhou, Guilin and other special districts has been advanced by about twenty days to a month compared to last year.

This year's fast and good winter planting is the result of implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and vigorously carrying out mass movements. After the CPC Committee of Guilin Special District successively convened various meetings to convey and discuss the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session, the enthusiasm of the masses was very high, forming a winter planting upsurge. A 300,000-strong labor force vigorously engaged in winter planting, and the planting progress in various regions was very fast. Mashan County further publicized the Party's general line for socialist construction after the Eighth Plenary Session, and the cadres and masses were even more motivated and have exceeded the winter planting plan. Many areas are both fighting drought and planting at the same time. Luzhai, which was affected by the drought, has completed the winter planting task, and Shanglin County has fought drought and rushed to plant more than 54,000 mu of winter fields.

Currently, various regions are adopting intercropping and mixed cropping, and utilizing vacant land by the fields and houses to expand the winter planting area.

    种得多　种得快　种得好
    贵州秋种比往年提早一个月超额完成
    广西抗旱抢播粮食蔬菜绿肥面积超过去年
    新华社贵阳5日电　今年，贵州省秋种工作比往年提前一个月超额完成。小麦播种六百零二万亩，超过计划20.5％，比去年增加82％。油菜播种六百二十三万亩，超过计划3.8％，比去年增加两倍多，其他杂粮播种面积也都超过计划。许多动手早，进度快的地区，已转入田间管理工作。
    今年秋种的多快好省，具体、生动的表现了人民公社的优越性。人民公社统一安排劳力、组织协作，并广泛使用了各种新式和改良农具。许多公社的机械厂和农具厂在秋种中发挥了很大的作用，鸭溪人民公社的机械厂一年来制造了大小十一万件农具，供三秋用的新式和改良农具有七千多件。大大提高了劳动效率，加快了秋种速度。公社举办的集体福利事业，对加快秋种速度作了有力支援；望谟县八百五十一个公共食堂，全部采取送饭上山，或搬锅灶到工地的办法，节约了大量劳动时间。
    在秋种中，社社队队都培植了大小面积不等的丰产坝，丰产坡，丰产沟等等。各地特别注意了秋种质量。铜仁专区各级党委组织了领导干部、青年、妇女、老农八万三千人的秋种检查团。深入田间就地检查秋种。有些地区层层建立了检查组织，逐级检查验收，总结先进经验，树立标兵，掀起热火朝天的红旗竞赛。黔南布依族苗族自治州七十二个人民公社，通过红旗竞赛，给农村带来了“三高”“三多”的新气象：社员政治热情高，生产积极性高，劳动效率高；干部参加生产多，社员出勤多，先进事迹多。铜仁县两天竞赛的结果，就出现了一千二百四十九个一人的劳动效率顶两人的标兵。
    新华社南宁5日电　广西各地大搞群众运动，冬种进展又快又好。现在全省已播种粮食、蔬菜、绿肥等各种作物五百一十多万亩，占计划面积47.7％，相当于去年同期的四倍半。融安、柳城等十二个县一马当先，已超额完成今年冬种计划。河池县播种约四万多亩小麦，普遍经过二犁三耙，深耕六寸以上，每亩施肥五十一担，大部分经过石灰水或盐水选种。百色专区不少地区改变了原来耕作粗放，冬种不犁不耙不下肥的习惯，普遍碎土起畦，放足基肥。柳州、桂林等专区冬种都比去年提早二十天到一个月左右。
    今年冬种又快又好，是贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，反右倾、鼓干劲，大搞群众运动的结果。桂林专区各级党委连续召开各种会议，传达和讨论八中全会精神后，群众积极性很高，形成了冬种热潮，三十万劳动大军大闹冬种，各地播种进度很快。马山县在八中全会后进一步宣传了党的社会主义建设总路线，干部群众干劲鼓得更足，已超额完成冬种计划。不少地区边抗旱、边播种。受旱的鹿寨已经完成冬种任务，上林县抗旱抢种冬田五万四千多亩。
    目前，各地正采取间种套种，利用田边、宅旁空闲地扩大冬种面积。
