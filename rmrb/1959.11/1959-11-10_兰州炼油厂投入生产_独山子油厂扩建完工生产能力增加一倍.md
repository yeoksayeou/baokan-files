Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th: The first phase of the Lanzhou Oil Refinery was officially put into production recently after being approved by the state upon inspection. The second phase of the project is under construction with added intensity.

The Lanzhou Refinery is currently the most advanced large-scale oil refinery in China in terms of refining technology and equipment. Since construction began in April 1956, all construction and installation workers, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, completed the first phase of the project fifteen months ahead of schedule after two years and four months of effort. Following this, they achieved outstanding results in accident-free trial operation, and began accepting production tasks from the first quarter of this year.

The designed processing capacity of the first phase of the project is one million tons. All sixteen sets of production equipment that have been put into operation in the factory are automated. In addition to producing gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and ordinary lubricating oil for vehicles, it can also produce high-grade products such as aviation gasoline, aviation kerosene, and high-grade lubricating oil in large quantities.

The Lanzhou Refinery has also made new contributions to the comprehensive utilization of petroleum resources. Waste gas and high-viscosity residual oil, which can only be burned as fuel or treated as by-products in general refineries, can be refined into gasoline and diesel at the Lanzhou Refinery. After special treatment, petroleum waste gas can also be supplied to chemical plants as raw materials for manufacturing capron and synthetic rubber. The oxidized paraffin wax equipment, which will soon be put into production, can produce a wide variety of fatty acids for manufacturing soap and other products. The factory has also recently adopted a combination of foreign and indigenous methods to produce products such as carbon black, letterpress printing ink, bicycle oil, sewing machine oil, and cart oil for the market.

The Lanzhou Refinery was built with the assistance of the Soviet Union. Ninety Soviet construction experts and operation experts came to the refinery one after another to provide guidance. Soviet factories manufactured more than 4,500 sets of mechanical and technological equipment for the Lanzhou Refinery and supplied more than 4,000 automated instruments. All parts of the country have also vigorously supported the construction of this modern refinery.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 9th: Xinjiang's Dushanzi Refinery has become a large modern oil refining factory in China. The factory began a large-scale second-phase expansion project in May last year. Now, except for some equipment in the thermal power plant that has not yet been installed, all other projects have been completed nine months ahead of schedule and put into production successively before the end of October.

The original scale and equipment of the Dushanzi Refinery were relatively small and could not meet the needs of the development of Xinjiang's petroleum industry. In the second phase of the expansion project, units such as the distillation workshop, the double-furnace cracking workshop, the coking workshop, the thermal power plant, and the circulating water plant were further expanded, and some giant oil tanks and other equipment were added. After these projects are put into production, the equipment capacity for processing crude oil will be doubled compared to the past, and the main products such as gasoline, diesel, petroleum coke, and asphalt will be greatly increased.

### 兰州炼油厂投入生产  独山子油厂扩建完工生产能力增加一倍

    兰州炼油厂投入生产
　　独山子油厂扩建完工生产能力增加一倍
    据新华社兰州8日电　兰州油厂第一期工程经国家验收批准以后在最近正式投入生产。它的第二期工程正在加紧施工。
    兰州炼油厂是我国目前炼油技术设备最先进的大型炼油厂。从1956年4月开工兴建以后，全体建筑安装职工在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，经过两年零四个月的努力，提前十五个月建成了第一期工程；接着又获得了无事故试运转的突出成绩，从今年第一季度开始接受生产任务。
    第一期工程的设计处理量为一百万吨。全厂已经投入生产的十六套生产装置，都是自动化的。它除了生产车用汽油、煤油、柴油和普通润滑油以外，还能大量生产航空汽油、航空煤油、高级润滑油等高级产品。
    在综合利用石油资源方面，兰州炼油厂也有新的贡献。在一般炼油厂只能作燃料烧掉或者作副产品处理掉的废气、高粘度渣油等，兰州炼油厂却能从中再提炼出汽油和柴油。石油废气经过特殊处理以后，还能供给化工厂做制造卡普龙和合成橡胶的原料。即将投入生产的氧化石蜡装置，可以生产种类繁多的脂肪酸，供制造肥皂等用。这个厂最近还采取洋土结合的办法，为市场生产了炭黑、铅印油墨、自行车油、缝纫机油、大车油等产品。
    兰州炼油厂是苏联帮助我国建设的。有九十名苏联施工专家和运转专家先后来到炼油厂指导。苏联的工厂为兰州炼油厂制造了四千五百多台机械工艺设备，并且供给了四千多件自动化仪表。全国各地也大力支援了这个现代化炼油厂的建设。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐9日电　新疆独山子炼油厂已经成为我国一座大型现代化石油炼制厂。这个厂从去年5月开始了规模巨大的第二期扩建工程。现在，除热电站部分设备尚未安装外，其它各项工程已比原计划提前九个月全部竣工，并且在10月底以前陆续投入生产。
    独山子炼油厂原来的规模设备较小，不能适应新疆石油工业发展的需要，在第二期扩建工程中，蒸馏车间、双炉裂化车间、焦化车间、热电站、循环水厂等单位都进一步扩大，还增加了一部分巨型油罐等设备。这些工程投入生产后，处理原油的设备能力将比过去提高一倍，汽油、柴油、油焦和沥青等主要产品都将大大增加。（附图片）
