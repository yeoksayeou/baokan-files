    Shanghai Refinery Carries Out Technical Innovation and Comprehensive Utilization
    New Varieties Increase by 2.7 Times Compared to Last Year
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Shanghai Refinery workers, in response to the shortage of crude oil this year, have deeply launched a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, resulting in the number of new products increasing from the seventeen put into production last year to forty-two this year. Including the varieties successfully trial-produced this year, the total reaches sixty-three, exceeding 2.7 times the total of last year.
    In order to fully utilize raw materials, at the beginning of this year, all the workers of the factory put forward the slogan "Crude oil can be transformed into ten thousand kinds of oil." They adopted the method of comprehensive utilization of cracked gas, processing and trial-producing liquefied hydrocarbons from the cracked gas that used to be used as fuel in the factory, to replace gasoline and calcium carbide. According to the preliminary statistics of 65 vehicles used by Shanghai Public Transport Third Depot and other units alone, 77 tons of gasoline can be replaced every month. In addition, this cracked gas was also used to produce an important raw material for medicine—a mixed alcohol containing propanol and butanol; using the "waste" discharged into the Huangpu River in the past—acid sludge and alkali sludge—to make aluminum naphthenate soap, which can be used as a preservative for fishing nets; later, it was further made into naphthenic acid, an auxiliary material urgently needed by the textile, leather making and other industries. In addition, they also adopted the method of creating new varieties from oil, turning low-grade products into high-grade products, and increasing new varieties. For example, extracting petroleum ether from gasoline used in ordinary automobiles not only increased new products, but also turned the refined gasoline into a high-grade product that can be used for scientific research. As a result of vigorously promoting comprehensive utilization, twenty-one new products have been put into production in the factory from January to September, and the production value of these products accounts for about 5% of the total output value of the factory.
    In the process of vigorously promoting comprehensive utilization, the difficulties encountered by the Shanghai Refinery were the shortage of equipment, manpower, and technical force. They relied on the masses and carried out technical innovation on a large scale to overcome these difficulties. In solving the equipment problem, the entire factory resolutely implemented the principle of focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises and combining indigenous and foreign methods, adopting simplified process flows, and arming themselves with indigenous equipment. Their specific method was "large leading small," that is, installing small equipment on large equipment; for example, when extracting petroleum ether, old oil drums were installed on a small fractionation tower. In this way, three specifications of petroleum ether were extracted without adding a piece of foreign equipment or an operator. Another method is to "replace foreign with indigenous." For example, the cold pressing dewaxing workshop for processing transformer oil used twenty-four wooden indigenous presses instead of five "Moore filter presses." As a result, 160 tons of steel were saved. Another method is to "replace new with old," using existing old equipment to put it together for production. Because they adopted this series of methods to solve the equipment problem, they saved money and achieved quick results.
    In solving the manpower and technical problems, they seized the phenomenon of labor imbalance in production, combined it with the adjustment of labor organization, rationally used labor, and organized workers to carry out the "versatile worker" movement, which greatly promoted technical innovation. Due to the development of the versatile worker movement, most of the refinery workers in the factory have now learned to be "versatile workers," and can solve problems such as equipment maintenance, machine installation, and processing of parts and components by themselves.
    Another aspect of technical innovation is to vigorously promote mechanization and replace heavy manual labor with machinery. For example, the Supply and Marketing Section formed a technical innovation commando team composed of eleven people, including drivers, porters, and sailors. This commando team has already made bucket-linked coal conveyors, dump trucks, and wooden docks, which have solved the problem of insufficient equipment and greatly reduced physical labor.

    上海炼油厂革新技术开展综合利用
    新品种比去年增加二点七倍
    本报讯　上海炼油厂职工针对今年原油不足的情况，深入开展技术革新与技术革命的群众运动，使今年的新产品由去年投入生产的十七种发展到四十二种，加上今年试制成功的品种，共达六十三种，超过去年总和的二点七倍。
    为了充分利用原料，今年一开始，全厂职工提出了“原油能变万种油”的行动口号。他们采取综合利用裂化气的办法，把过去厂内作燃料用的裂化气加工试制成液态烃，用来代替汽油和电石。仅据上海公交三场等单位的六十五辆汽车使用的初步统计，每月就可代替汽油七十七吨。另外，还用这种裂化气制成了医药上的重要原料——含有丙醇和丁醇的混合醇；利用过去排入黄浦江的“废物”——酸碴和碱碴，制成环烷酸铝皂，这种东西可用作渔网防腐剂；后来又进一步制成一种纺织、制革等工业极需要的辅助材料环烷酸。此外，他们还采用从油里翻花样的办法，变低等产品为高级产品，增加新品种。如从一般汽车使用的汽油中提取石油醚，不仅增加了新产品，而且还使提炼后的汽油变成可作科学研究用的高级产品。大搞综合利用的结果，全厂1至9月已有二十一种新产品投入生产，这些产品的生产价值占全厂总产值的5％左右。
    在大搞综合利用的过程中，上海炼油厂碰到的困难是设备、人力和技术力量的不足。他们依靠了群众，大搞技术革新，克服了这些困难。在解决设备问题上，全厂坚决贯彻了以中小型为主，土洋结合的方针，采用简化工艺流程，用土设备武装自己。他们的具体作法是“以大带小”，即在大设备上装置小设备；如在提取石油醚的时候，就是在小型分馏塔上装旧油桶。这样，提取了三种规格的石油醚，并没有增加一部洋设备，也没有增加一个操作人员。另一种办法是“以土代洋”。如加工变压器油的冷榨脱蜡车间就是用二十四台木制土法压榨机代替五台“摩尔式压滤机”。结果节省了一百六十吨钢材。再一种办法就是“以旧代新”，利用现有的旧设备拼凑起来，进行生产。由于他们采取了这一系列的办法来解决设备问题，结果既省了钱，收效又快。
    在解决人力和技术问题方面，他们抓住生产中出现的劳力不平衡现象，结合调整劳动组织，合理使用劳动力，组织工人开展“多面手”运动，大大促进了技术革新。由于多面手运动的开展，现在全厂大部炼油工人都学会了做“多面手”，对设备维修、机器安装和零件、部件的加工等都能自己动手解决问题。
    技术革新的另一个方面，是大搞机械化，用机械代替繁重的体力劳动。如供销科就将司机、搬运工、水手等十一人组成技术革新突击队，这个突击队，已经制成斗连输煤机、翻斗车和木码头等，解决了设备不足和大大减轻了体力劳动。
