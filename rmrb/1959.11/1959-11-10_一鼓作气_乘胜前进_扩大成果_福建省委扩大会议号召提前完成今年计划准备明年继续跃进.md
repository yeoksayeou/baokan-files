The Fujian Provincial Party Committee held its First Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the Sixteenth Session from October 8th to 16th. Participating in this meeting were all members of the Provincial Party Committee, the first secretaries of various regions (cities) and counties, and responsible party cadres from provincial-level directly affiliated agencies and the military, totaling 1,800 people. The meeting finally adopted the "Resolution on Further Deepening the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement."

This Provincial Party Committee Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting listened to Comrade Ye Fei, Alternate Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and First Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee, convey the resolutions and spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and conducted earnest and enthusiastic study and discussion. The meeting unanimously expressed complete support for the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and resolved to thoroughly implement them to achieve even greater victories for the Party's General Line in Fujian. The meeting unanimously agreed that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee was a meeting of great historical significance for the Party. It powerfully armed the entire Party and all working people politically and ideologically, and will have an immeasurable and far-reaching impact on safeguarding the Party's General Line, continuing to resolutely implement the General Line, smashing the slanders and attacks of domestic and foreign hostile elements, criticizing and overcoming the right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning emotions of wavering elements, and promoting the continued leap forward of the socialist construction cause.

After reviewing the work in various fields in Fujian Province since the beginning of this year, the meeting pointed out with satisfaction that, thanks to the resolute implementation of the Party's General Line by party organizations at all levels and all the people of Fujian Province, all fronts in the province have achieved brilliant achievements in continuing the leap forward on the basis of last year's extraordinary leap forward. From January to September, the total industrial output value increased by 38.4% compared with the same period last year. Among them, the output of major items such as iron, steel, coal, and electricity generation all increased by more than double compared with the same period last year; the annual timber procurement task has been overfulfilled three months ahead of schedule; industrial capital construction has increased by 93.8% compared with the same period last year, and twenty-two key projects have begun production. This year's agricultural production is still a leap forward. Although the sown area of ​​summer harvest crops was reduced and suffered several serious water and drought disasters, it still achieved a bumper harvest equivalent to the total output of summer harvest crops last year, and diversified operations have also greatly developed. The vast majority of commune members increased their income during the summer distribution. The communes have embarked on a path of sound development, and are increasingly demonstrating their enormous superiority in all aspects. The total volume of freight transportation increased by 80.9% compared with the same period last year, and the total retail sales of social commodities increased by 27.9% compared with the same period last year, and the market is increasingly prosperous. Great achievements have also been made in cultural, educational, health, and anti-enemy struggle work. The meeting specifically pointed out that, since the implementation of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the fight against right-leaning ideas, the encouragement of hard work, and the launch of a vigorous increase production and practice economy movement, after the great battles of August and September, a new leap forward situation has emerged on all fronts, and everywhere is a scene of prosperity and prosperity. The total industrial output value in August increased by 16.8% compared with July, and in September it increased by 56.8% compared with August. The output of many major industrial products has risen sharply. Among them, the average daily output of iron in September increased by 1.5 times compared with August, and steel increased by 1.6 times. Other heavy industries, light industries, and handicrafts have also greatly increased, and the quality of products has also been significantly improved. The autumn agricultural production movement is surging, relying on the collective strength of the people's communes to overcome four extraordinarily strong typhoons and floods, and launched an unprecedented scale of autumn grain overproduction movement.

The meeting proved with irrefutable facts that the Party's General Line for socialist construction is completely correct, and it is completely in line with the objective laws of socialist construction and development in our country and Fujian. Fujian Province not only achieved an extraordinary leap forward last year, but also achieved a continued leap forward this year; not only did industry leap forward, agriculture leaped forward, but also transportation, commerce, culture, education, and other undertakings achieved great victories; not only can we leap forward this year, but judging from the existing good conditions, we will definitely achieve a new leap forward next year. The people's communes are not "run badly," but are more consolidated, run better and better, and their advantages are being brought into full play; the Party's leadership and mass movement have not been "weakened," but are increasingly strengthened, and have accumulated increasingly rich experience, and the relationship between the Party and the masses and the relationship between cadres and the masses are closer. These facts have thoroughly shattered the shameless slanders and vicious attacks of anti-socialist class enemies and right-leaning opportunists on the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes; at the same time, they have also profoundly educated the broad masses, enabling them to further improve their understanding, recognize the true face of anti-socialist class enemies and right-leaning opportunists who oppose socialism and oppose the General Line, thereby being vigilant and stopping the harm of their reactionary influence. These great achievements have also powerfully criticized some cadres who are timid and afraid of difficulties in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, emphasize difficulties, are content to be in the middle, and do not actively complete leap forward plans that can be achieved through efforts, and other right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning emotions.

After analyzing the situation in various aspects of Fujian Province since the beginning of this year, especially since the great battles of August and September, the meeting believes that the situation is very good and the victory is great. As long as we seize the opportunity, strike while the iron is hot, advance triumphantly, and expand the results, it is entirely possible to complete the magnificent plan for the continued leap forward of the province's national economy this year ahead of schedule and above the target. The meeting deployed the current work, proposing that on the basis of the victory of fighting against right-leaning ideas, encouraging hard work, and fighting the great battles of August and September, the entire Party and the entire people should be mobilized to advance triumphantly, with agriculture as the focus, to carry out the increase production and practice economy movement on a wider, deeper, and larger scale, to carry out the socialist labor competition of comparing with advanced, learning from advanced, and catching up with advanced, to fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, to tap all potentials, to make great efforts in technological innovation and technological revolution, to ensure the completion of this year's continued leap forward plan ahead of schedule and above the target, and to make full preparations for the leap forward next year.

The meeting pointed out that in agriculture, we must immediately launch a massive "Four Autumns" movement of autumn harvest, autumn planting, autumn procurement, and autumn distribution to ensure that the total agricultural output value increases by more than 20% compared with last year. We must concentrate our efforts on doing a good job in the autumn harvest of grain and oil crops, achieving careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, ensuring that every grain is stored in the barn, and guaranteeing a bumper harvest. In areas where the season is later, we should do our best to do a good job in field management and post-processing of crops, do a good job in the fight against disasters, and strive for more harvests. In winter planting, we should implement the policy of multiple varieties, high yields, and multiple harvests, and do our best to plant more grain and green manure crops. On the premise of ensuring bumper harvests of grain and oil, we should vigorously grasp diversified operations, march towards the mountains and the sea, march towards animal husbandry and sideline occupations, vigorously grasp collective pig raising and the production of livestock and poultry, and strive to increase the average income per person by about ten yuan in the fourth quarter. We should vigorously grasp fishery production, vigorously grasp the production of wild fibers, wild oil crops, medicinal materials, and handicrafts, and establish commodity production bases for agricultural and sideline products as soon as possible in a planned way. We should attach importance to agricultural mechanization, and currently should combine the autumn harvest to promote semi-mechanized agricultural tools such as rapid harvesters and promote vehicularization. This winter and next spring, we must vigorously carry out mass movements centered on water, soil, and fertilizer to create conditions for the continued leap forward in agriculture next year. The people's communes throughout the province must complete the commune rectification work from beginning to end. The main content of the commune rectification is: to carry out a socialist education movement to defend the Party's General Line, to carry out an increase production and practice economy movement, to resolutely implement the central government's policies on communes, and to establish and improve operation and management systems. This year's distribution work should be regarded as an important political task and done well. In industry, we must implement the policy of serving agricultural production, further carry out the mass movement of increase production and practice economy with high output, high quality, low cost, and safe production, and strive to complete this year's product and output value plans far ahead of schedule and above the target, ensuring that the total industrial output value increases by more than 30% compared with last year. We should take supporting agriculture as an important task, and vigorously grasp the production and capital construction of agricultural machinery, fertilizers, and pesticides. At the same time, we should vigorously grasp the production of raw materials, materials, fuels, and electricity, especially the production of iron and steel, coal, timber, sugar, paper, and salt. The meeting requires all industrial production units to make preparations for various plans for industrial production in the first quarter of next year as early as possible, and to ensure that the industrial production in the first quarter of next year has a good start and is red every month. In terms of financial and trade work, we must implement the established policies of the central government and strive to overfulfill the grain procurement task. We should conscientiously do a good job in the purchase of agricultural products and the supply of materials, support production, and invigorate the market. In addition, the meeting also deployed transportation, culture, education, health, anti-enemy struggle and other work. The meeting also called for continuing to implement the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, running communes with diligence and thrift, running all undertakings with diligence and thrift, and managing households with diligence and thrift, and practicing strict economy.

The meeting requested all Party members and revolutionary cadres to further study the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, to further deepen the fight against right-leaning ideas, to encourage hard work, to improve their awareness, and to better complete the Party's tasks. The meeting requested that a large-scale socialist education movement to defend the General Line be launched among the broad masses this winter and next spring to further improve the socialist awareness of the broad masses, to encourage the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, to strive for the early and over-fulfillment of Fujian Province's leap forward plan this year, and to bravely struggle for a continued leap forward next year!

Finally, Comrade Ye Fei, on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee, made a summary, and gave important instructions on the current fight against right-leaning ideas, the encouragement of hard work, the great battles in the fourth quarter, and the launching of a new upsurge in the increase production and practice economy movement. Comrade Ye Fei called on all Communist Party members and all cadres to conscientiously study the spirit of the meeting, unify their understanding, improve their awareness, strengthen unity, encourage revolutionary enthusiasm, unite the people of the province, vigorously carry out mass movements, hold high the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and strive for leap forward, further leap forward, and greater leap forward in the cause of socialist construction!

    一鼓作气　乘胜前进　扩大成果
    福建省委扩大会议号召提前完成今年计划准备明年继续跃进
    本报讯　中共福建省委于10月8日至16日举行第一届第十六次全体（扩大）会议。参加这次会议的有省委全体委员、各地（市）、县委第一书记，省直属机关和部队的党员负责干部共一千八百人。会议最后通过了“关于进一步深入开展增产节约运动的决议”。
    这次省委全体（扩大）会议听取了中共中央候补委员、中共福建省委第一书记叶飞同志传达党的八届八中全会的决议和精神，并进行了认真的热烈的学习和讨论。会议一致表示，完全拥护党的八届八中全会的决议，决心深入贯彻，使党的总路线在福建取得更加伟大的胜利。会议一致认为，八届八中全会是党的一次具有重大历史意义的会议，它在政治上和思想上强有力地武装了全党和全体劳动人民，对于保卫党的总路线，继续坚决贯彻总路线，粉碎国内外敌对分子的诽谤和攻击，批判和克服不坚定分子的右倾思想和右倾情绪，促进社会主义建设事业的继续跃进，将发生无可估量的巨大作用和极其深远的影响。
    会议检查了福建省今年以来各方面的工作以后，满意地指出：由于福建省党的各级组织和全体人民坚决贯彻执行了党的总路线，今年全省各条战线都在去年特大跃进的基础上，取得了继续跃进的辉煌成就。1至9月工业总产值比去年同期增长了38.4％，其中铁、钢、煤、发电量等主要项目的产量，都比去年同期增加了一倍以上；全年到材任务已提前三个月超额完成；工业基本建设比去年同期增长了93.8％，有二十二个重点工程开始投入生产。今年农业生产仍是跃进，夏收作物虽然播种面积减少，又遭受数次严重的水旱灾害，但仍然获得了相当于去年夏收作物总产量的大丰收，多种经营也都有了很大发展。夏季分配中绝大部分社员增加了收入。公社走上了健全发展的道路，在各方面日益显示了巨大的优越性。货物运输总量比去年同期增长80.9％，社会商品零售额比去年同期增长27.9％，市场日益繁荣。文教卫生、对敌斗争等工作，也都取得了巨大成就。会议特别指出，在贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，反右倾、鼓干劲，开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动以来，经过大战8、9月，各条战线出现了新的跃进局面，到处是一片繁荣兴旺的景象。工业总产值8月份比7月份增长16.8％，9月份又比8月份增长56.8％。许多主要工业产品的产量都直线上升，其中9月份铁的平均日产量比8月份增长一点五倍，钢增长一点六倍。其他重工业、轻工业和手工业都有很大增长，产品质量也有明显的提高。秋季农业生产运动涌汹澎湃，依靠人民公社的集体力量战胜了四次特大的风灾和水灾，并开展了规模空前的秋粮超产运动。
    会议以无可辩驳的大量事实证明，党的社会主义建设总路线是完全正确的，它完全符合我国和福建社会主义建设发展的客观规律。福建省不仅去年取得了特大跃进，今年又获得了继续跃进；不仅工业跃进，农业跃进，而且交通、商业、文教等事业也取得了很大的胜利；不仅今年能够跃进，从现有良好条件看，明年一定还会实现新的跃进。人民公社不是“办糟了”，而是更加巩固，越办越好，优越性日益充分发挥出来；党的领导和群众运动不是“削弱了”，而是日益加强，并积累了越来越丰富的经验，党群关系和干群关系更加密切。这些事实彻底地粉碎了反社会主义的阶级敌对分子和右倾机会主义分子对总路线、大跃进、人民公社的无耻诽谤和恶毒的攻击；同时，也深刻地教育了广大群众，使他们进一步提高了认识，认清了反社会主义的阶级敌对分子、右倾机会主义分子反对社会主义、反对总路线的真面目，从而警惕和制止其反动影响的危害。这些伟大成就，也有力地批判了某些干部在社会主义建设事业大跃进中畏首畏尾、强调困难、甘居中游，不积极去完成经过努力可以实现的跃进计划等等右倾思想和右倾情绪。
    会议在分析了福建省今年以来，特别是大战8、9月以来各方面的情况后，认为形势很好，胜利很大，只要抓紧时机，一鼓作气，乘胜前进，扩大战果，提前和超额完成今年全省国民经济继续跃进的宏伟规划是完全可能的。会议部署了当前工作，提出在反右倾、鼓干劲，大战8、9月的胜利基础上，动员全党全民乘胜前进，以农业为重点，更广泛、更深入、更大规模地开展增产节约运动，开展比先进、学先进、赶先进的社会主义劳动竞赛，充分调动广大群众的积极性和创造性，挖掘一切潜力，大闹技术革新和技术革命，保证提前超额完成今年继续跃进计划，并为明年跃进作好充分的准备。
    会议指出，在农业方面，当前必须立即开展声势浩大的秋收、秋种、秋季征购、秋后分配的“四秋”运动，保证农业总产值比去年增加20％以上。必须集中力量搞好粮食和油料的秋收工作，作到精收细打，颗粒归仓，保证丰产丰收。季节较晚的地区，应尽力搞好田间管理和农作物后期加工，搞好反灾害斗争，力争多收。冬种贯彻多种、高产、多收的方针，尽力多种粮食和绿肥作物。在保证粮油丰收的前提下，大抓多种经营，向山、海进军，向畜牧、副业进军，大抓集体养猪和家畜家禽的生产，力争第四季度平均每人增加十元左右的收入。大抓渔业生产，大抓野生纤维、野生油料、药材生产和手工业生产，有计划地尽快建立农副产品商品生产基地。重视农业机械化工作，目前应结合秋收推广快速收割机等半机械农具和推行车子化。今冬明春要大力开展以水、土、肥为中心的群众运动，为明年农业继续跃进创造条件。全省人民公社必须善始善终地完成整社工作，整社的主要内容是：进行保卫党的总路线的社会主义教育运动，开展增产节约运动，坚决贯彻中央有关公社的政策，建立和健全经营管理制度。今年的分配工作要当成一项重要的政治任务，切实搞好。在工业方面，必须贯彻为农业生产服务的方针，进一步开展高产、优质、低成本和安全生产的增产节约群众运动，力争大大提前和超额完成今年的产品和产值计划，保证工业总产值比去年增长30％以上。把支援农业作为一项重要任务，大抓农业机械、化肥、农药的生产和基本建设。同时，大抓原料、材料、燃料、电力的生产，特别是钢铁、煤炭、木材、糖、纸、盐等生产。会议要求所有工业生产单位，要及早作好明年第一季度工业生产的各项计划和准备，保证明年第一季度的工业生产开门红、月月红。在财贸工作方面，必须贯彻中央既定的方针，力争超额完成粮食征购任务。认真作好农产品收购和物资供应工作，支援生产，活跃市场。此外，会议并部署了交通运输、文教卫生、对敌斗争等工作。会议还号召继续贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业、勤俭持家的方针，厉行节约。
    会议要求全体党员和革命干部，进一步学习党的八届八中全会的文件，进一步深入反右倾、鼓干劲，提高觉悟，更好地完成党的任务。会议要求今冬明春在广大群众中展开一个大规模的保卫总路线的社会主义教育运动，进一步提高广大群众的社会主义觉悟，鼓足群众的革命干劲，为提前超额完成福建省今年跃进的计划，为明年继续跃进而英勇奋斗。
    会议最后由叶飞同志代表省委作了总结，对当前反右倾、鼓干劲，大战四季度，掀起增产节约运动新高潮，作了重要指示。叶飞同志号召全体共产党员和全体干部认真学习会议精神，统一认识，提高觉悟，加强团结，鼓足革命干劲，团结全省人民，大搞群众运动，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光荣旗帜，争取社会主义建设事业跃进，再跃进，更大跃进！
