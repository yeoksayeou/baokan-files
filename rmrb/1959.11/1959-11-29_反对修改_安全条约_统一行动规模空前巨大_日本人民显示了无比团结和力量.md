Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th: The eighth unified action against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" held by the Japanese people on the 27th was the largest in scale of all the unified actions against the revision of the "Security Treaty," and its scale and strength far exceeded the struggle last autumn to successfully prevent the Kishi Nobusuke government from revising the "Police Duties Execution Law."

In the unified action, the Japanese working class played a vanguard role. Workers belonging to the Japan Coal Miners' Union, the Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union Federation, the All-Japan Transport Workers' Union, and the All-Japan Metal Workers' Union held strikes simultaneously across the country. Other unions, including the National Railway Workers' Union and the All-Communications Workers' Union, which have been deprived of the right to strike, held workplace rallies.

Joint struggle organizations against the revision of the "Security Treaty" at the prefectural, municipal, town, and village levels presided over 690 mass rallies and demonstrations and petitioned local governments. An unprecedented number of people participated in these rallies and marches. In the evening, lantern parades were also held in many places.

In Tokyo, approximately 100,000 people gathered at three locations near the Diet Building and then staged an unprecedentedly powerful petition to the Diet, demanding that the government immediately halt negotiations to revise the "Security Treaty." Among those participating in the petition were striking workers, workers from various industries, office workers, male and female students, representatives of farmers from neighboring prefectures in the Kanto region, intellectuals, Buddhist priests, members of peace groups, youth groups, women's groups, and trade unions. The participants were very broadly representative.

The area around the Japanese Diet turned into a sea of red flags and a forest of placards. Petitioners angrily raised their arms and shouted slogans such as: "Oppose the revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," "Demand the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet," and "Kishi Nobusuke resign!" Their songs and slogans shook the earth and resounded through the sky. Japanese radio broadcasts said, "This is the first time such a scene has appeared since the establishment of the Japanese Diet."

Prior to the start of the petition, the Kishi Nobusuke government dispatched 5,500 armed police and armored vehicles, and ordered another 10,000 police to be "on alert." The police set up cordons, brutally beat petitioners, and prevented them from entering the Diet. However, the heroic and unyielding Japanese people, disregarding police persecution, broke through the police cordon, entered the Diet, and submitted their petition.

The petition stated that the ongoing negotiations between the Japanese and U.S. governments to revise the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty would place Japan in a dangerous situation, exacerbate tensions in Asia, and increase the risk of nuclear war. The petition then elaborated on the various reasons for demanding an immediate halt to negotiations on the revision of the "Security Treaty."

The petition said that revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" runs counter to the global trend and would create extremely dangerous tensions in Asia; the new treaty includes the spirit of the U.S. "Vandenberg Resolution," which violates the Japanese Constitution and carries the serious risk of Japan being automatically drawn into war.

The petition stated that due to the revision of the "Security Treaty," Japan would become part of the U.S. nuclear strategy system, and the risk of the U.S. military bringing nuclear weapons into Japan and the "Self-Defense Forces" being nuclear-armed would increase. This revision is completely contrary to the Japanese people's hope to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs.

The petition also pointed out that revising the "Security Treaty" would seriously hinder the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China. Strengthening the U.S.-Japan military alliance is to increasingly blatantly implement a policy of hostility towards China. This is not only completely contrary to the government's responsibility and obligation to end the state of war that still continues between Japan and China and to establish peaceful relations between the two countries, but it would also create a new crisis of war in Asia.

The petition also pointed out that revising the "Security Treaty" would obligate Japan to increase its military strength, and the national burden in terms of military spending would become increasingly large. The current military expenditure has already severely oppressed the people's lives, and any further increase would be intolerable for the people.

The petitioners also submitted a petition regarding the restoration of normal relations with China. They demanded that the Diet immediately take measures to force the Kishi Nobusuke government to abandon its hostile policy towards China, sever relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and restore diplomatic relations with China.

They also submitted a petition against paying reparations to South Vietnam. This petition called for postponing the payment of reparations until Vietnam achieves peaceful reunification. The petition stated that the reparations planned by Kishi Nobusuke would exacerbate tensions in Asia; it is closely linked to the government's conspiracy to revise the "Security Treaty."

Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma, Communist Party Chairman Sanzo Nosaka, and General Secretary of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) Akira Iwai spoke to the petitioners.

Asanuma pointed out that the Liberal Democratic Party fears the powerful mass movement held today and forcibly passed the agreement to compensate South Vietnam in the Diet early this morning. Asanuma said that Kishi Nobusuke had already driven millions of our fathers and brothers to the battlefield to die during the Tojo cabinet era. Now, we must do everything in our power to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." He stated that the Socialist Party, encouraged by the masses today, will step up its struggle. He said that the Socialist Party will submit a draft resolution to the Diet demanding a halt to negotiations on the revision of the "Security Treaty."

Communist Party Chairman Sanzo Nosaka said that today's unified action exceeds last year's unified action by the people against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" in terms of both breadth and depth. He emphasized that this struggle should continue until victory is achieved. He stressed that this is a way for the Japanese people to answer the expectations of the people of Asian countries.

Kameda told the petitioners that Japanese farmers are now waking up to the dangers of revising the "Security Treaty" and are rising up to fight. Kameda said that Japanese farmers have enormous potential for struggle.

Although more than two hundred petitioners were injured by the police, their morale was high and their fighting spirit was strong. After the successful completion of the petition, a general mobilization rally was held inside the Diet Building, the first people's gathering held in the Diet.

The conference adopted a declaration of struggle. The declaration pointed out that we are standing at the forefront of the eighth national unified action to launch a struggle, expressing the determination of a nationwide total resistance against the government and the Liberal Democratic Party.

The declaration strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for instructing the police to suppress the people's petition action, which was an exercise of legitimate rights, and injuring many petitioners.

The declaration firmly stated that now, the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," which determines Japan's peace and the nation's future, is facing a decisive stage, and we are standing up with extreme anger, will strengthen unity, and will launch a nationwide total resistance struggle from every corner of the country. On December 10, we will launch the ninth national unified action to strive for the immediate cessation of negotiations on the revision of the "Security Treaty" and to prevent the signing of a new "Security Treaty."

After the rally, the petitioners also held a demonstration at the government's "Defense Agency." (Attached image)

    反对修改“安全条约”统一行动规模空前巨大
    日本人民显示了无比团结和力量
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本人民27日在全国举行的第八次反对修改日美“安全条约”统一行动是历次反对修改“安全条约”统一行动中声势最大的一次，它的规模和力量远远超过了去年秋天胜利阻止岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争。
    在统一行动中，日本工人阶级起了先锋作用。属于日本煤矿工会、合成化学产业工会联合会、全日本通运公司工会和全日本金属工会的工人们在全国各地一齐举行了罢工。其它工会，其中包括被剥夺了罢工权的国营铁路工会、全递信从业员工会举行了工作场所大会。
    县、市、镇、村各级反对修改“安全条约”共同斗争组织主持举行了六百九十个群众集会和示威游行和向各地方政府进行了请愿。空前多的人参加了这些集会和游行。晚间，许多地方还举行了提灯游行。
    在东京，共约十万人先在国会大厦附近三个地方集合，然后向国会进行了声势空前的请愿，要求政府立即停止修改“安全条约”的谈判。参加请愿的人当中有：罢工工人、各种行业的工人、职员、男女学生、来自关东地方邻近各县的农民代表、知识分子、佛教法师、和平团体、青年团体、妇女团体和工会的会员。参加者的代表性非常广泛。
    日本国会周围变成了红旗的海洋和标语牌的森林。请愿者们愤怒地振臂高呼：“反对修改日美安全条约”、“要求废除日美安全条约”、“打倒岸信介内阁”、“岸信介下台”等口号。他们的歌声和口号声震撼大地，响彻天空。日本电台广播说，“这是日本国会建立以来第一次出现的情景”。
    岸信介政府在请愿开始前就出动了五千五百名武装警察和装甲车，并且命令另外一万名警察“戒备”。警察们设立了封锁线，野蛮殴打请愿者，并阻挡他们进入国会。但是英勇不屈的日本人民不顾警察的迫害，冲破了警察的封锁线，进入国会，提交了请愿书。
    请愿书写道，目前日本政府和美国政府进行着的修改日美安全条约谈判，将使日本陷于危险状态，加剧亚洲紧张局势，使核战争危机增大。请愿书接着阐述了要求立即停止修改“安全条约”的谈判的各项理由。
    请愿书说，修改日美“安全条约”同世界大势背道而驰、会在亚洲造成极其危险的紧张状态；新条约中包括了美国的“范登堡决议”的精神，这是违反日本国宪法的，它具有使日本自动地被卷入战争这样一种严重的危险性。
    请愿书说，由于修改“安全条约”，日本将变成美国原子战略体系的一部分，美军把核武器运进日本、“自卫队”实行核武装的危险性将会增加。这种修改内容是同日本人民希望禁止原子弹和氢弹的立场完全相反的。
    请愿书还指出，修改“安全条约”将严重阻碍日中两国恢复邦交。加强日美军事同盟是要越来越露骨地执行敌视中国的政策。这不仅同政府应当结束日中两国仍然继续着的战争状态、建立日中两国和平关系的责任和义务完全相反，而且会在亚洲造成新的战争的危机。
    请愿书还指出，修改“安全条约”将使日本承担增强军事力量的义务，国民在军费方面的负担将越来越增大。现在的军费已经严重地压迫了人民的生活，再要增加，人民是不能忍受的。
    请愿者还提出了关于同中国恢复正常关系的请愿书。他们要求国会立即采取措施，使岸信介政府放弃它的敌视中国的政策，同蒋介石集团断绝关系，并同中国恢复邦交。
    他们还提交了一份反对向南越支付赔偿的请愿书。这份请愿书要求把赔偿推迟到越南实现和平统一以后支付。请愿书说，岸信介计划支付的赔偿将加剧亚洲的紧张局势；它是同政府修改“安全条约”的阴谋有密切联系的。
    社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎、共产党主席野坂参三和日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章等向请愿者们讲了话。
    浅沼指出，自由民主党害怕今天举行的强大的群众运动，在今天一早强使国会通过了给南越赔偿的协定。浅沼说岸信介在东条内阁时代就已经把我们的成百万的父兄赶上战场而死亡。现在，我们要尽一切力量来阻止修改日美“安全条约”。他表示，社会党在今天群众的鼓舞下，将加紧斗争。他说，社会党将向国会提交一项要求停止修改“安全条约”谈判的决议草案。
    共产党主席野坂参三说，今天的统一行动在广度和深度方面超过了去年人民反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的统一行动。他强调说，这个斗争应当继续进行下去，直到取得胜利为止。他着重指出，这是日本人民可以答复亚洲各国人民的期望的一个办法。
    龟田对请愿者说，日本农民现在正在醒悟到修改“安全条约”的危险性，并且正在起来斗争。龟田说，日本农民具有着巨大的斗争潜力。
    请愿者中虽然有二百多人被警察打伤，但是他们情绪振奋，斗志昂扬。在请愿胜利完成后又接着在国会大厦内举行了总奋起大会，这是国会里举行的第一次人民的集会。
    大会通过了一项斗争宣言。宣言指出，我们站在第八次全国统一行动的前列展开了斗争，表达了针对着政府和自由民主党的全民性总抵抗的决心。
    宣言强烈谴责岸信介政府指使警察镇压人民行使正当权利的请愿行动，打伤许多请愿者。
      宣言坚决表示，现在，决定日本的和平和民族前途的阻止修改“安全条约”斗争正面临决定性阶段，我们以万分愤怒的心情站起来，将加强团结，从全国每一个角落掀起全民性总抵抗的斗争。在12月10日，将展开第九次全国统一行动，争取立即停止修改“安全条约”的谈判，阻止签署新“安全条约”。
    请愿者在大会结束后，又向政府的“防卫厅”举行了示威。（附图片）
