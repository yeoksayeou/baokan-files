    Hydraulic Transmission Internal Combustion Engine Locomotive Born in Qingdao
    Fiberglass Cement Barge Trial Voyage in Xingang

    Xinhua News Agency reported that China's first 2,000-horsepower hydraulic transmission mainline passenger "Satellite" internal combustion engine locomotive was recently successfully trial-produced at the Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory. Tests have proven that the locomotive runs well. Currently, this locomotive has been sent to Beijing.

    The successful manufacturing of this locomotive marks a new stage in China's locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing technology—the stage of using advanced hydraulic transmission high-power internal combustion engine locomotives has begun from now on.

    The transmission of internal combustion engines is divided into hydraulic (oil) transmission and electric transmission. Internal combustion engine locomotives using hydraulic transmission have higher technical and economic indicators than those using electric transmission and are currently the cutting-edge technology in locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing worldwide. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, several locomotive and rolling stock factories in China have successively started trial production of internal combustion engine locomotives. The high-power internal combustion engine locomotive manufactured by the Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, using two sets of 1,000-horsepower hydraulic transmissions, is the first one.

    This type of hydraulic transmission internal combustion engine locomotive has more advantages than electric transmission internal combustion engine locomotives. It can basically eliminate the need for copper and silicon steel sheets in manufacturing, thereby reducing the weight of the car body by 25% to 35% and reducing manufacturing costs by about 30%. This locomotive can better adapt to areas with high temperatures and humidity, as well as desert areas, and can continuously travel more than 800 kilometers without adding fuel along the way.

    The design of this locomotive started in August last year, and it was successfully trial-produced in just over a year. During the design and trial production process, it received strong support from the Railway Science Research Institute, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, and guidance from Soviet experts.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 15th: China's first domestically-made 200-ton large-scale fiberglass cement barge was launched for trial voyage at Xingang, Tanggu, on the 13th, proving that it fully meets the requirements for navigation.

    This barge was jointly researched and trial-produced in Tianjin by the Cement Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Glass and Ceramics Research Institute, the Water Transport Planning and Design Institute of the Ministry of Communications, and the First Engineering Department of the Hebei Provincial Department of Transportation Navigation Engineering Bureau. The workers and engineering technicians who participated in the trial production demonstrated a daring and capable communist style, adopting a method of simultaneous research, design, and construction, and overcame many difficulties.

    This barge is assembled from ninety-four pre-fabricated fiberglass cement components. The entire ship used only a little over five tons of steel, saving ninety-four tons of steel compared to ordinary steel barges.

    Using fiberglass to build ships can not only save a large amount of steel and wood, greatly reduce costs, but also has many excellent properties. Compared with steel ships, fiberglass cement ships do not rust, have no magnetic induction, have low thermal conductivity, and are easy to form; compared with wooden ships, they also have the advantages of high strength, corrosion resistance, insect resistance, and being difficult to burn.

### 液力传动内燃机车在青岛诞生  玻璃纤维水泥驳船在新港试航

    液力传动内燃机车在青岛诞生
    玻璃纤维水泥驳船在新港试航
    据新华社讯　我国第一台二千马力的液力传动干线客运“卫星号”内燃机车，最近在四方机车车辆厂试制成功。试验证明，机车运行良好。目前，这台机车已开往北京。
    这种机车的制造成功，标志着我国机车车辆制造技术的新阶段——采用先进的液力传动的大功率内燃机车阶段，从此就开始了。
    内燃机车的传动分液力（油）传动和电力传动两种。采用液力传动的内燃机车，比采用电力传动的内燃机车有着更高的技术、经济指标，是当前世界机车车辆制造中的尖端技术。从1958年大跃进以来，我国有好几个机车车辆厂都先后开始了内燃机车的试制，四方机车车辆厂制造的用两组一千马力液力传动的大功率内燃机车是第一台。
    这种液力传动的内燃机车，比电力传动的内燃机车有着更多的优点，它在制造中可以基本上不用铜和矽钢片，从而就能减轻车体自重25％到35％，降低制造成本约30％。这种机车可以更好地适应于温度高、湿度大的地区和沙漠地区，而且在中途不增加燃料可以连续行驶八百多公里。
    这台机车从去年8月开始设计，仅用一年多时间就试制成功了。在设计、试制过程中，曾得到了铁道科学研究院、上海交通大学、北京工业学院，以及大连机车车辆厂等单位的大力支援和苏联专家的指导。
    据新华社天津15日电　我国自制的第一艘二百吨大型玻璃纤维水泥驳船，13日在塘沽新港下水试航，证明完全合乎航行的要求。
    这艘驳船是由建筑工程部水泥科学研究院、玻璃陶瓷研究院，交通部水运规划设计院和河北省交通厅航务工程局第一工程处等单位，共同在天津研究试制成功的。参加试制的工人和工程技术人员，在试制中发挥了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，采用了边研究、边设计、边施工的方法，克服了许多困难。
    这艘驳船是用九十四块玻璃纤维水泥预制构件装配而成的，全船只用了五吨多钢材，比普通钢质驳船节约了钢材九十四吨。
    用玻璃纤维造船，不仅可以节约大量的钢材和木材，大大降低成本，而且具有很多优良的性能。与钢质的船舶比较，玻璃纤维水泥船不生锈，无磁感应，导热性低，易于成型；它与木船比较也有强度高、耐腐蚀、不怕虫蛀、不易燃烧等优点。
