    Hefei Electric News from this Newspaper: The staff of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company's Hongqi No. 2 small blast furnace—a flag of the national small blast furnaces—has recently climbed to new heights in various production indicators under the encouragement of the National Congress of Heroes. In October, the average utilization coefficient of this small blast furnace increased from an average of 2.125 from January to September to 3.201, the coke ratio decreased from an average of 0.904 from January to September to 0.812, and the qualified rate of iron reached 100%. From the 25th to the 27th, the blast furnace utilization coefficient reached above 4 for three consecutive days.
    The volume of the Hongqi No. 2 small blast furnace is eight cubic meters. Like other small blast furnaces, the equipment is relatively simple. Moreover, the coke used is small-sized coke screened from the crushed coke unused by large blast furnaces, and the ore is small-sized ore screened from the crushed ore unused by large blast furnaces. Most of the workers are new workers. However, because they paid attention to learning the experience of other small blast furnaces in production from the very beginning of construction, they are ambitious and not afraid of difficulties. Therefore, since it was put into production in November last year, it has shown great power, and various production indicators have soared. In the struggle to win high output, high quality, and low consumption, the Hongqi No. 2 small blast furnace has tried every means to improve smelting intensity and reduce coke ratio. For example, the tuyere of the small blast furnace was expanded from 55 mm to 74 mm, so that the air volume per cubic meter of volume increased to 6 cubic meters, and the smelting intensity reached above 2. After the air volume increased, they took many measures to increase the air temperature, and promoted the advanced experience of multi-nozzle combustion, so that the air temperature increased from about 400 degrees to the current 650 degrees. Due to the increase of air volume and the increase of air temperature, the coke consumption was reduced, and the smelting time was shortened, so that the output increased rapidly.
    In order to improve the output and quality of small blast furnaces, they also constantly improve operating techniques, establish and improve various rules and regulations, and strengthen production management. Workers are very careful in screening, washing, and processing raw materials, and strictly implement the "four no entry" principle, that is, raw materials without chemical composition analysis reports are not allowed to enter the furnace, raw materials with particle sizes exceeding specifications are not allowed to enter the furnace, raw materials that are not screened are not allowed to enter the furnace, and muddy ore is not allowed to enter the furnace. Whenever muddy ore is encountered, no matter how cold the weather is, workers have to go barefoot into the water to wash the ore. According to the characteristics of small blast furnace production, they have also formulated blast furnace operating procedures, safety operating systems, and a series of rules and regulations for furnace front, hot air, hoisting, and blowing. These rules and regulations are simple and clear, and every worker can consciously and strictly implement them.
    The staff of the Hongqi No. 2 small blast furnace also constantly innovate technology, improve work efficiency, and carefully calculate everywhere to reduce production costs. For example, they changed the original manual charging to mechanical charging, changed the sand casting bed in front of the furnace to iron molds, and improved the furnace top distribution method, so that the number of workers in the small blast furnace was reduced from more than 90 to more than 50.
    After they were selected as an advanced collective to attend the National Congress of Heroes, the production enthusiasm of the employees became even higher. They are determined to create greater achievements and hold the red flag of high output, high quality, and low cost of small blast furnaces even higher.

    小高炉标兵再创新纪录
    马鞍山红旗二号小高炉十月份平均利用系数达到三点二零一
    本报合肥电　全国小高炉的一面旗帜—马鞍山钢铁公司红旗二号小高炉职工，最近在全国群英会的鼓舞下，各项生产指标又登上了新的高峰。10月份，这座小高炉的平均利用系数从1至9月份平均二点一二五提高到三点二零一，焦比由1至9月份平均零点九零四降低到零点八一二，铁的合格率达到百分之百。25日至27日连续三天，高炉利用系数都达到了四以上。
    红旗二号小高炉的容积是八立方米，和其他小高炉一样，设备比较简陋，而且所用的焦炭是大高炉不用的碎焦中筛出的小块焦，矿石是大高炉不用的碎矿中筛出的小块焦，工人绝大部分都是新工人。但是由于他们从一建炉就注意学习其他小高炉在生产中的经验，有志气，不怕困难，因此从去年11月份开炉生产以来，就大显威风，各项生产指标飞跃上升。在争夺高产、优质、低消耗的斗争中，红旗二号小高炉想尽一切办法来提高冶炼强度与降低焦比。如把小高炉的风口由五十五公厘扩大到七十四公厘，使每立方公尺容积的受风量提高到六立方公尺，冶炼强度达到了二以上。风量增加后，他们又采取了许多措施提高风温，并推广了多咀燃烧的先进经验，使风温由四百度左右提高到目前的六百五十度左右。由于加大了风量和提高了风温，降低了焦炭消耗，缩短了冶炼时间，使产量迅速上升。
    为了提高小高炉的产量和质量，他们还不断改进操作技术，建立和健全各种规章制度，加强了生产管理。工人们对原料的筛、洗和加工都非常认真，严格做到了四不入炉，即原料没有化验成分单不入炉、粒度超过规格不入炉、原料不过筛不入炉、泥巴矿不入炉。一遇到泥巴矿，不管天气多冷，工人也要赤脚下水洗矿。根据小高炉生产的特点，他们还制定了高炉操作规程，安全操作制度，以及炉前、热风、卷扬、鼓风等一系列的规章制度。这些规章制度简单明了，每个工人都能自觉的严格执行。
    红旗二号小高炉的职工还不断地革新技术，提高工作效率，处处精打细算，来降低生产成本。如他们将原来的人工上料改为机械上料，把炉前沙做的出铁铸床改为铁模，以及改进炉顶布料方法等，使小高炉的工人由原来的九十多人减少到五十多人。
    这次他们被选为出席全国群英会的先进集体后，职工们的生产热情更加高涨。他们决心创造更大的成就，把小高炉高产、优质、低成本的红旗举得更高。
