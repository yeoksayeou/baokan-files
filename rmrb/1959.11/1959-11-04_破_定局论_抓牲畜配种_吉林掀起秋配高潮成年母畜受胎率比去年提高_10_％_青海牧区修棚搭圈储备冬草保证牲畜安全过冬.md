Smashing the "Theory of Fixed Outcome" and Grasping Livestock Breeding
Jilin Launches an Autumn Mating Upsurge with an Adult Female Livestock Conception Rate 10% Higher Than Last Year
Qinghai Pastoral Areas Build Sheds and Pens and Store Winter Grass to Ensure Livestock Safety Through the Winter
This newspaper Changchun, November 3rd electric dispatch Jilin Province, after thoroughly criticizing the "theory of fixed outcome"'s slackening thoughts, has launched an upsurge of autumn mating of large livestock and has already achieved great results. Currently, 81% of the province's adult female large livestock have been mated, and the conception rate is greatly improved compared to the same period last year.

From pastoral areas to agricultural areas, from mountainous areas to plains, one can see herds of cattle and horses and pens full of pigs and sheep in Jilin Province. This year, the characteristics of livestock development are: more births, more survival, fatter, stronger, and more improved breeds. According to statistics at the end of June, the number of large livestock has developed to 1,859,000 head, an increase of 7.6% compared to 1958; the number of sheep has developed to 5,650,000, an increase of 50.2%. The quality has also been greatly improved. Among the 70,000 foals produced this year, 16,000 were improved breeds, an increase of 1.3 times over last year; out of 180,000 lambs, 130,000 were improved breeds, accounting for 80% of the total from 1952 to 1956. In the Baicheng area, where pasture is lush, the net increase in cattle, horses, and sheep has increased three times compared to the average net increase in the past nine years, and the number of newborn foals has increased three times compared to last year.

This year's great harvest in animal husbandry in Jilin Province is the result of conscientiously implementing the General Line and of comprehensively implementing the eight measures for increasing livestock such as "water, grass, feed, breed, breeding, management, prevention, and labor" after the realization of the people's communes. Various localities, in accordance with the requirements of the all-out leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, have strengthened their leadership over animal husbandry and carried out huge basic construction and organizational work in animal husbandry production. People's communes in various localities, due to their large population and abundant funds, have established professional teams, formed a large army of animal husbandry; adopted the method of grazing livestock in groups by type, male and female, strong and weak, old and young, and implemented a responsibility system of fixed personnel, fixed groups, fixed fatness, and fixed remuneration, which has improved the enthusiasm of herdsmen to love and protect livestock. The Baicheng area built more than 24,000 livestock sheds and more than 2,000 lambing rooms, greatly reducing the mortality of weak and young livestock. The province has established more than 2,400 artificial insemination stations, trained 8,200 breeding technicians, and carried out year-round breeding; implemented a system of separate feeding of pregnant livestock and special personnel responsible for protecting the fetus and protecting the foal, which has improved the pregnancy rate and reduced miscarriages. In addition, various localities have established livestock disease prevention and control networks, which have effectively prevented the threat of various epidemics to animal husbandry production. According to a survey of Hailong, Yongji and other four counties, the livestock mortality rate from January to June last year was 4.4%, and from January to June this year it was 2.4%, a reduction of 2%.

After the publication of the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, under the slogan of opposing Right-leaning, boosting morale, working hard for sixty days, and striving for full pregnancy of female livestock to prepare for continued leap forward next year, peasants and herdsmen in various localities, through the method of airing views and debates, affirmed that autumn is a good season for breeding large livestock. Autumn mating ensures that the young livestock of cattle and sheep are born in the lush pasture season of spring and summer, which is easy to survive, and can solve problems such as cold weather and withered grass in autumn and winter, which are not conducive to the growth of young livestock, thereby thoroughly criticizing the "theory of fixed outcome"'s slackening thoughts, and launching an autumn mating upsurge centered on checking livestock and supplementing mating. In the movement, various localities have adopted the method of launching mass movements on a large scale, generally inspecting female livestock, and immediately organizing supplementary mating if they find any empty or missed mating. Various localities have adopted many effective measures to solve the contradiction between the use of draught animals and mating during the autumn harvest. The Baoshan People's Commune in Panshi County organized four breeding personnel to lead male livestock deep into various production teams for mobile mating. Some divided female livestock into groups and put some male livestock in them, and combined artificial insemination and natural mating to carry out multiple mating and heavy mating, which had a very good effect. According to a survey of Qian'an, Da'an, Zhenlai, Tongyu and other counties, eighty management areas and forty-nine production teams have achieved full pregnancy of female livestock. At present, the province has mated more than 584,600 head of large livestock, accounting for 81% of the adult female livestock, with a conception rate of 72.8%, which is 10% higher than the same period last year; more than 276,000 ewes are pregnant, accounting for 90% of the adult ewes.

At present, various localities are vigorously carrying out a blitz of supplementary mating while carrying out fetal protection work. Pregnant female livestock are kept in separate pens, released separately, and used rationally. After holding meetings of herdsmen, transporters, and feeders to exchange experiences, the Gongpeng Commune in Yushu County determined a "five don'ts" system for fetal protection: don't let pregnant livestock drink cold water, don't leave them unattended, don't let them get wet in the autumn rain, don't kick or fight, and don't pull mills or drive carriages. This commune has basically eliminated livestock abortions.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining dispatch A great situation has emerged in animal husbandry production on the Qinghai grassland. After more than two months of efforts by herdsmen of all ethnic groups, the livestock in pastoral areas has eliminated all three categories of thinness, and less than 5% are in the second category of thinness. The autumn mating work of eligible female livestock has basically ended, and the conception rate is generally above 90%. Many communes, due to the unified arrangement of labor for mowing grass and building sheds, have achieved large livestock having pens, young livestock having sheds, and storing enough grass and fodder for various livestock to supplement feeding in winter and spring. Disease prevention and control work has also been done particularly well. As of now, more than 20 million head of livestock of various types have been vaccinated, more than double that of last year. These efforts have laid the foundation for ensuring that livestock safely survives the winter and spring, and for a greater harvest in animal husbandry next year.

The call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has brought infinite strength to the herdsmen of Qinghai. Under the slogan of "Everything for overproduction of livestock," herdsmen of all ethnic groups are advancing in all aspects of production, with each link closely linked to the next. In order to ensure that all livestock are at full fatness and eligible female livestock are fully pregnant, the production teams of many communes have put forward measures to consolidate the first category of fatness and eliminate the second category of fatness on the basis of further improving the production responsibility system. Many herdsmen eat with the herds and sleep with the herds, and take measures such as rotational grazing and frequent changes of pastures to ensure that livestock often eat new grass. The grazing time is generally extended to more than thirteen hours, and night grazing is also carried out for large livestock such as cattle and horses. Many communes in Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture select old, weak, and sick livestock to be grazed by the most experienced and responsible commune members, and supplement them with marmot meat soup, tea, and salt, so that the livestock fatness rises rapidly. Many communes conduct individual inspections of eligible female livestock, and immediately supplement mating if they find any empty or missed mating.

At present, the Qinghai grassland is about to enter the cold season of wind, snow, and withered grass. Herdsmen in various localities are continuing to grasp autumn fattening, mating, and fetal protection, and at the same time, further launch an upsurge of building sheds and storing winter grass to ensure that livestock feeding and winter preparation are both leaping forward. In addition, various localities have also concentrated a part of the labor force to actively build warm lambing sheds and prepare for lambing and raising lambs in advance.

    破“定局论”抓牲畜配种
    吉林掀起秋配高潮成年母畜受胎率比去年提高10％
    青海牧区修棚搭圈储备冬草保证牲畜安全过冬
    本报长春3日电　吉林省在彻底批判了“定局论”的松劲思想后，掀起大家畜秋季配种高潮，已得到很大成绩。现在，全省大家畜成年母畜已有81％配完种，受胎率比去年同期大大提高。
    吉林省从牧区到农业区，从山区到平原，都可看到牛马成群，猪羊满圈的景象。今年，牲畜牧畜发展的特点是：生的多，活的多，胖的多，壮的多，改良多。到6月末统计，大家畜已发展到一百八十五万九千头，比1958年增殖7.6％；羊发展到五百六十五万只，增殖50.2％。质量也有很大提高。今年产的七万匹马驹，其中改良驹有一万六千匹，比去年增加一点三倍；十八万只羊羔，有十三万只是改良羔，占1952年到1956年总和的80％。在牧草繁茂的白城地区，牛、马、羊净增数比过去九年间平均净增数提高三倍，新生的马驹比去年增加三倍。
    今年吉林省牧业大丰收，是认真执行总路线的结果，是实现人民公社后能全面贯彻“水、草、料、种、繁、管、防、工”等八项增畜措施的结果。各地根据农林牧副渔全线跃进的要求，加强了对牧业的领导，在牧业生产上进行了巨大的基本建设和组织工作。各地人民公社由于人多资金雄厚，建立起了专业队伍，组成了牧业大军；采取了种类、公母、壮弱、老幼分群放牧的办法，推行了定人、定群、定膘、定报酬等责任制后，提高了放牧员爱畜保畜的积极性。白城地区修建二万四千多间畜舍畜棚和二千多间产羔室，大大减少了弱畜和幼畜的死亡。全省建立起二千四百多处人工授精站，培养八千二百多名配种技术手，进行常年配种；对孕畜实行了分槽饲养、专人负责保胎护驹制度，提高了怀胎率，减少了流产。此外，各地都建立了牲畜疫病防治网，有力地防治了各种疫病对牧业生产的威胁。据海龙、永吉等四县的调查，牲畜死亡率去年1至6月是4.4％，今年1月至6月是2.4％，减少了2％。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，各地农牧民在反右倾，鼓干劲，大干六十天，力争母畜全满怀，为明年继续跃进准备条件的口号下，通过鸣放辩论的方法，肯定了秋季是大家畜配种的好季节。秋季配种，牛羊的幼畜正是生在春夏牧草繁茂季节，易于成活，能解决秋冬天冷、草枯，对幼畜生长不利等问题，从而彻底批判了“定局论”的松劲思想，掀起了一个以查畜补配为中心的秋季配种高潮。在运动中，各地采取大搞群众运动的方法，普遍检查母畜，发现空怀漏配的立即组织补配。各地采取了很多有效的办法，解决秋收中耕畜使役与配种的矛盾。磐石县宝山人民公社组织四名配种员，牵公畜深入到各生产队流动配种。有的将母畜单分成群，放进一些公畜，采取人工授精和自然交配相结合的办法进行多配重配，效果很好。据乾安、大安、镇赉、通榆等县的调查，已有八十个管理区和四十九个生产队实现了母畜满怀。目前，全省已配完大家畜五十八万四千六百多头，占大家畜中成年母畜的81％，受胎率达72.8％，比去年同时期提高10％；已有二十七万六千多只母羊怀胎，占成年母羊的90％。
    现在各地正在一面大力进行突击补配，一面进行保胎工作。对怀胎母畜实行了单圈、单放，合理使役。榆树县弓棚公社，通过召开放牧员、运输员、饲养员会议交流经验后，确定了“五不要”的保胎制度：不要孕畜饮冷水，不要没人看管，不要淋秋雨，不要踢仗，不要拉磨和驾辕。这个社已基本消除牲畜流产现象。
    新华社西宁讯　青海草原上牧业生产出现大好形势。经过各族牧民两个多月的努力，牧区各类牲畜已经消灭了三类膘，二类膘也不到5％。适龄母畜的秋季配种工作已经基本结束，受胎率一般都在90％以上。许多公社由于统一安排打草修棚的劳力，都已实现了大畜有圈、幼畜有棚和储备了足够各类牲畜冬春补饲用的草料。畜病防治工作也做得特别出色，截止目前，经过预防注射的各类牲畜已有两千多万头次，超过去年一倍。这些工作，都为保证牲畜安全度过冬春，为明年畜牧业更大丰收打下了基础。
    党的八届八中全会的号召给青海牧民们带来了无限力量。各族牧民在“一切为了超产牲畜”的口号下，各项生产齐头并进，一环紧扣一环。为了保证全部牲畜满膘，适龄母畜满怀，不少公社的生产队在进一步健全生产责任制的基础上，又提出了巩固一类膘、消灭二类膘的措施。许多放牧员吃在畜群、睡在畜群，采取划片轮牧、勤换草场的办法，保证牲畜经常吃到新草，放牧时间普遍延长到十三小时以上，对牛马等大牲畜还进行夜牧。果洛藏族自治州不少公社抽出老弱病畜，由最有经验和责任心最强的社员负责放牧，并用旱獭肉汤、茶叶、食盐等进行补饲，畜膘上升很快。许多公社对适龄母畜逐个进行检查，发现空怀、漏配马上补配。
    目前，青海草原即将进入风雪严寒的枯草季节。各地牧民都在继续抓好秋膘、配种、保胎的同时，进一步掀起修棚搭圈、储备冬草的高潮，保证做到牲畜饲放和过冬准备双跃进。此外，各地还集中一部分劳力积极修筑羊羔暖棚，提前进行接羔育羔的准备工作。
