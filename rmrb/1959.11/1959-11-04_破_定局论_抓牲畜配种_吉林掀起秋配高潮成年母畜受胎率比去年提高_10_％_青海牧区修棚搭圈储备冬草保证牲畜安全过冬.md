Smashing the "Theory of Fixed Outcome" and Grasping Livestock Breeding
Jilin Launches an Autumn Mating Upsurge with an Adult Female Livestock Conception Rate 10% Higher Than Last Year
Qinghai Pastoral Areas Build Sheds and Pens and Store Winter Grass to Ensure Livestock Safety Through the Winter
This newspaper Changchun, November 3rd electric dispatch Jilin Province, after thoroughly criticizing the "theory of fixed outcome"'s slackening thoughts, has launched an upsurge of autumn mating of large livestock and has already achieved great results. Currently, 81% of the province's adult female large livestock have been mated, and the conception rate is greatly improved compared to the same period last year.

From pastoral areas to agricultural areas, from mountainous areas to plains, one can see herds of cattle and horses and pens full of pigs and sheep in Jilin Province. This year, the characteristics of livestock development are: more births, more survival, fatter, stronger, and more improved breeds. According to statistics at the end of June, the number of large livestock has developed to 1,859,000 head, an increase of 7.6% compared to 1958; the number of sheep has developed to 5,650,000, an increase of 50.2%. The quality has also been greatly improved. Among the 70,000 foals produced this year, 16,000 were improved breeds, an increase of 1.3 times over last year; out of 180,000 lambs, 130,000 were improved breeds, accounting for 80% of the total from 1952 to 1956. In the Baicheng area, where pasture is lush, the net increase in cattle, horses, and sheep has increased three times compared to the average net increase in the past nine years, and the number of newborn foals has increased three times compared to last year.

This year's great harvest in animal husbandry in Jilin Province is the result of conscientiously implementing the General Line and of comprehensively implementing the eight measures for increasing livestock such as "water, grass, feed, breed, breeding, management, prevention, and labor" after the realization of the people's communes. Various localities, in accordance with the requirements of the all-out leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, have strengthened their leadership over animal husbandry and carried out huge basic construction and organizational work in animal husbandry production. People's communes in various localities, due to their large population and abundant funds, have established professional teams, formed a large army of animal husbandry; adopted the method of grazing livestock in groups by type, male and female, strong and weak, old and young, and implemented a responsibility system of fixed personnel, fixed groups, fixed fatness, and fixed remuneration, which has improved the enthusiasm of herdsmen to love and protect livestock. The Baicheng area built more than 24,000 livestock sheds and more than 2,000 lambing rooms, greatly reducing the mortality of weak and young livestock. The province has established more than 2,400 artificial insemination stations, trained 8,200 breeding technicians, and carried out year-round breeding; implemented a system of separate feeding of pregnant livestock and special personnel responsible for protecting the fetus and protecting the foal, which has improved the pregnancy rate and reduced miscarriages. In addition, various localities have established livestock disease prevention and control networks, which have effectively prevented the threat of various epidemics to animal husbandry production. According to a survey of Hailong, Yongji and other four counties, the livestock mortality rate from January to June last year was 4.4%, and from January to June this year it was 2.4%, a reduction of 2%.

After the publication of the Communiqu√© and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, under the slogan of opposing Right-leaning, boosting morale, working hard for sixty days, and striving for full pregnancy of female livestock to prepare for continued leap forward next year, peasants and herdsmen in various localities, through the method of airing views and debates, affirmed that autumn is a good season for breeding large livestock. Autumn mating ensures that the young livestock of cattle and sheep are born in the lush pasture season of spring and summer, which is easy to survive, and can solve problems such as cold weather and withered grass in autumn and winter, which are not conducive to the growth of young livestock, thereby thoroughly criticizing the "theory of fixed outcome"'s slackening thoughts, and launching an autumn mating upsurge centered on checking livestock and supplementing mating. In the movement, various localities have adopted the method of launching mass movements on a large scale, generally inspecting female livestock, and immediately organizing supplementary mating if they find any empty or missed mating. Various localities have adopted many effective measures to solve the contradiction between the use of draught animals and mating during the autumn harvest. The Baoshan People's Commune in Panshi County organized four breeding personnel to lead male livestock deep into various production teams for mobile mating. Some divided female livestock into groups and put some male livestock in them, and combined artificial insemination and natural mating to carry out multiple mating and heavy mating, which had a very good effect. According to a survey of Qian'an, Da'an, Zhenlai, Tongyu and other counties, eighty management areas and forty-nine production teams have achieved full pregnancy of female livestock. At present, the province has mated more than 584,600 head of large livestock, accounting for 81% of the adult female livestock, with a conception rate of 72.8%, which is 10% higher than the same period last year; more than 276,000 ewes are pregnant, accounting for 90% of the adult ewes.

At present, various localities are vigorously carrying out a blitz of supplementary mating while carrying out fetal protection work. Pregnant female livestock are kept in separate pens, released separately, and used rationally. After holding meetings of herdsmen, transporters, and feeders to exchange experiences, the Gongpeng Commune in Yushu County determined a "five don'ts" system for fetal protection: don't let pregnant livestock drink cold water, don't leave them unattended, don't let them get wet in the autumn rain, don't kick or fight, and don't pull mills or drive carriages. This commune has basically eliminated livestock abortions.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining dispatch A great situation has emerged in animal husbandry production on the Qinghai grassland. After more than two months of efforts by herdsmen of all ethnic groups, the livestock in pastoral areas has eliminated all three categories of thinness, and less than 5% are in the second category of thinness. The autumn mating work of eligible female livestock has basically ended, and the conception rate is generally above 90%. Many communes, due to the unified arrangement of labor for mowing grass and building sheds, have achieved large livestock having pens, young livestock having sheds, and storing enough grass and fodder for various livestock to supplement feeding in winter and spring. Disease prevention and control work has also been done particularly well. As of now, more than 20 million head of livestock of various types have been vaccinated, more than double that of last year. These efforts have laid the foundation for ensuring that livestock safely survives the winter and spring, and for a greater harvest in animal husbandry next year.

The call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has brought infinite strength to the herdsmen of Qinghai. Under the slogan of "Everything for overproduction of livestock," herdsmen of all ethnic groups are advancing in all aspects of production, with each link closely linked to the next. In order to ensure that all livestock are at full fatness and eligible female livestock are fully pregnant, the production teams of many communes have put forward measures to consolidate the first category of fatness and eliminate the second category of fatness on the basis of further improving the production responsibility system. Many herdsmen eat with the herds and sleep with the herds, and take measures such as rotational grazing and frequent changes of pastures to ensure that livestock often eat new grass. The grazing time is generally extended to more than thirteen hours, and night grazing is also carried out for large livestock such as cattle and horses. Many communes in Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture select old, weak, and sick livestock to be grazed by the most experienced and responsible commune members, and supplement them with marmot meat soup, tea, and salt, so that the livestock fatness rises rapidly. Many communes conduct individual inspections of eligible female livestock, and immediately supplement mating if they find any empty or missed mating.

At present, the Qinghai grassland is about to enter the cold season of wind, snow, and withered grass. Herdsmen in various localities are continuing to grasp autumn fattening, mating, and fetal protection, and at the same time, further launch an upsurge of building sheds and storing winter grass to ensure that livestock feeding and winter preparation are both leaping forward. In addition, various localities have also concentrated a part of the labor force to actively build warm lambing sheds and prepare for lambing and raising lambs in advance.
