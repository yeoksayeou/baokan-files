Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th: TASS reported from Moscow that Academician Sedov, President of the International Astronautical Federation, wrote an article in "Pravda" on the 14th, stating that radio contact between the Soviet automatic interplanetary station and ground observatories has now ceased. There may be various reasons for this. One possibility is that the sealing of the automatic interplanetary station was damaged due to a meteor impact, causing the instruments on the automatic interplanetary station to stop working.

Academician Sedov wrote that, according to the scientific research plan, the Soviet automatic interplanetary station has transmitted the basic information obtained during the first revolution to the ground. The Soviet Union is currently further processing the photos and scientific measurement materials of the far side of the moon; after the processing is completed, a detailed map of the far side of the moon will be published.

Academician Sedov pointed out that the successful experience of photographing in space and transmitting images to the ground is not only significant for understanding the natural phenomena on the far side of the moon, but also of great significance in successfully verifying new methods in modern experimental astronomy.

When talking about the first revolution of the automatic interplanetary station, Sedov said that when it passed through the lunar region, the closest distance to the moon's surface was 6,200 kilometers. When it returned to the Earth region along its orbit, the closest distance to the center of the Earth was 47,500 kilometers.

Sedov pointed out that the launch of every Soviet cosmic rocket is a new major step in the development of space navigation. The three significant cosmic rocket launches that have been completed will be recorded in history as basic stages for studying outer space and preparing for interstellar transportation. Obviously, these studies are only a beginning. A brighter prospect for space navigation lies ahead.

    苏联科学家谢道夫著文说
    苏联将发表月球背面详图
    自动行星际站所获基本情报已传到地面
    目前同地面观测站无线电联系已经停止
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：国际星际航空联合会主席、苏联科学院院士谢道夫14日在“真理报”上发表文章说，苏联自动行星际站和地面观测站之间的无线电联系现在已经停止。发生这种情况，可能有各种原因。有一种可能是：由于流星的撞击，破坏了自动行星际站的密封状态，因而使自动行星际站上的仪器停止了工作。
    谢道夫院士写道，根据科学研究计划，苏联自动行星际站已经把第一圈运行中得到的基本情报传到地面。苏联目前正在进一步整理月球背面的照片和科学测量材料；整理结束后，将发表月球背面详图。
    谢道夫院士指出，在宇宙中摄影并把影像传到地面的成功经验，不仅对认识月球背面的自然现象有意义；而且在成功地检验了现代实验天文学中的新方法这一点上，也具有十分重大的意义。
    谢道夫在谈到自动行星际站运行第一圈的情况时说，它通过月球区时，距月球表面最近的距离是六千二百公里。它在沿着轨道返回地球区时，距地球中心最近的距离是四万七千五百公里。
    谢道夫指出，苏联每一个宇宙火箭的发射都是在发展宇宙航行方面的新的重大步骤。已经完成的三次有重大意义的宇宙火箭的发射，将作为研究宇宙空间和准备星际交通的基本阶段载入史册。显然，这些研究仅仅是一个开端。宇宙航行的更美好的远景还在前面。
