On the Road of Technological Innovation
Duan Delin, Chief of Jiexiu Works Section, Taiyuan Railway Bureau

The Jiexiu Works Section is responsible for the maintenance and repair of 240 kilometers of the Nantongpu Railway of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, stretching from Yuci in the north to Linfen in the south. This section of the line is located in the Taihang Mountains, traversing the Fenhe River Valley, built along mountains and rivers, with sharp bends and steep slopes. Moreover, it was originally a narrow-gauge railway with low construction standards. Although it was widened in early 1956, the technical transformation has not yet been completed, and light, old, and mixed rails still account for one-third of the line.

Although the conditions of this line are poor, it is a major economic lifeline of Shanxi Province. It undertakes the heavy transportation tasks of Shanxi. Since the Great Leap Forward, the traffic volume on this section of the line has surged, the number of trains has increased, and the axle load has increased, while the maintenance and repair capacity of the line is very insufficient. Under such circumstances, vigorously carrying out a technical innovation movement centered on tool reform and realizing semi-mechanized track maintenance has become the only way to ensure the high-speed, smooth, and safe uninterrupted operation of trains.

At that time, Liang Shengcai's team in the Taigu Track Maintenance Work Area had already created the country's first semi-mechanized tamping machine. The Jiexiu Works Section seized this model, widely mobilized the masses through the Taigu on-site meeting, and put forward resounding slogans and clear directions: "Everyone contributes ideas, everyone contributes treasures, and all eight tools for track maintenance, including lifting, adjusting, changing, digging, filling, tamping, patting, and ramming, should be semi-mechanized." However, in the early stages of the movement, some people's thinking was not clear, and they were not interested in semi-mechanization. Some said: "What kind of machine is this? It's unsophisticated and uninteresting. If we don't change it, we don't change it. If we want to change it, we should mechanize it." Some believed that semi-mechanization was temporary, even saying it was a "waste," and adopted a passive attitude. In order to solve these problems, the leaders of the Works Section organized a free discussion, studied the Party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of policies for walking on two legs, and powerfully refuted these erroneous views. At that time, some technicians were superstitious about books, believing that workers could not produce anything; while some workers also believed that they had little education, did not understand science, and how could they invent and create? The Jiexiu Works Section used the typical example of Liang Shengcai's team to carry out education and break down various superstitious ideas. The broad masses were thus ideologically mobilized and actively contributed ideas. In order to welcome this upsurge of offering ideas, the Jiexiu Works Section also adopted methods such as "one person offers an idea, everyone appraises it," "distinguish between urgency and concentration of breakthroughs," "major suggestions are taken to the countryside with documents," and "technical personnel are responsible for separate items" to quickly process, appraise, and test tens of thousands of suggestions. New tools emerged like mushrooms after a rain. From July to September 1958 alone, 42 kinds of new tools in various forms were created, totaling 1,125 pieces. These new tools respectively adopted mechanical principles such as "leverage," "pulley," and "slope," greatly improving labor efficiency.

After the new tools were created, a climax of mass manufacturing and promotion of new tools was launched. In the manufacture of thousands of tools, the principle of "starting from scratch, self-reliance, self-made and self-used" was adhered to. Thirty-nine work areas in the section established "small local groups" tool manufacturing plants. The masses built small baking ovens themselves, took bellows from their own homes if they didn't have them, and learned technology by seeking teachers and friends if they lacked ironworkers. If they lacked materials, they launched a material donation campaign. Difficulties were solved one by one.

Semi-mechanization has been achieved, but it does not mean everything is fine. On the one hand, a large number of new tools were created in a very short period of time, and it is inevitable that some are rough and need to be continuously improved. Therefore, the Jiexiu Works Section mobilized the masses to carry out mass appraisal of the new tools to make the new tools more perfect. On the other hand, more importantly, after the tool reform, the original production organization, operation process, work hour quota, and operating procedures were no longer suitable, requiring the business management work to quickly keep up. In response to this new situation, the Jiexiu Works Section promptly strengthened management to consolidate the achievements of semi-mechanization.

The Jiexiu Works Section strengthened grassroots management, starting with verifying work hour quotas in order to closely integrate processes and normally organize production when using new tools. The method of verifying the quota is: "Combining professional verification with mass verification," "Combining verification with high technical skills with verification with low technical skills," and "Combining verification with statistics." Mass participation in verification and discussion of the results of the verification is the main method of implementing the mass line in verification. After verification, 96 new quotas were re-formulated. After the implementation of the new quotas, it in turn promoted the re-reform of tools. For example, the Taigu Work Area created a new gooseneck slag digging machine.

After the tool reform, there was a lack of a set of operating procedures suitable for the new tools, which hindered workers from quickly mastering the technology of the new tools. The Jiexiu Works Section solved this problem while verifying the work hour quota. When verifying the work hour quota, the reasons for different efficiency levels were analyzed, the operation methods of advanced workers were summarized, and after learning from each other's strengths and overcoming weaknesses, removing the crude and retaining the refined, a set of single-item operation essentials was summarized, ordered into procedures, and extracted into short slogans that were easy for workers to learn and remember, and found a way for the backward to catch up with the advanced technically. In the in-depth implementation of single-item operating procedures, the Jiexiu Works Section adopted a variety of forms, such as the on-the-spot training movement of learning while doing, the competition to select skilled workers, demonstration performances, and master-apprentice training. The results of the training assessment showed that 89% of the workers were qualified, 203 new workers reached the level of third-class track maintenance workers, and 50 single-item operation experts emerged.

Due to the realization of semi-mechanized track maintenance, the lines maintained by the Jiexiu Works Section now have a flat rail surface, smooth direction, beautiful track appearance, unobstructed ditches, complete signs, no high and low joints, and no decaying sleeper groups, which has increased the speed of trains by 42.4%. We are determined to maintain the railway even better and let the leap forward train roll forward.

    在技术革新的道路上
    太原铁路局介休工务段段长　段德林
    介休工务段负责养护维修太原铁路局南同蒲铁路北起榆次南止临汾共长二百四十公里的线路。这一段线路位于太行山地，穿越汾河峡谷，依山傍水，弯急坡陡；而且原来是窄轨，修建标准很低，经1956年初拨宽后，技术改造尚未完成，线路上轻、老、杂轨还占三分之一。
    这段线路条件虽然差，却是山西省的一条主要经济命脉线。它担负着晋中外运的繁重运输任务。大跃进以来，这段线路运量激增，车次加密，轴重加大，而线路的养护维修力量很不足。在这种情况下，大力开展以工具改革为中心的技术革新运动，实现养路半机械化，就成为保证列车高速、平稳、安全地不间断地运行的唯一出路。
    当时，太谷养路工区的梁生才小组已经创造了全国第一台半机械化捣固机。介休工务段抓住这个典型，通过太谷现场会议，广泛地发动了群众，提出响亮的口号和明确的方向：“人人献计，个个献宝，把养路的起、拨、改、扒、填、夯、拍、捣八种工具全部实现半机械化”。但是，在运动初期，也有些人思想不通，对半机械化不感兴趣。有的说：“这叫啥机器？土里土气没意思，不改就不改，要改就机械化”。有人认为半机械化是暂时的，甚至说是“浪费”，采取消极态度。为了解决这些问题，工务段领导上组织了一次鸣放辩论，学习了党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针，有力的驳斥了这种错误观点。当时，有些技术人员迷信书本，认为工人搞不出什么来；而有些工人也认为自己文化低，不懂科学，哪能发明创造？介休工务段利用梁生才小组的典型事例，进行了教育，破除了种种迷信思想。广大群众就这样从思想上发动起来，纷纷献计。为了迎接这个献计高潮，介休工务段又采取了“一人献计，大家鉴定”、“分别缓急，集中突破”、“重大建议，带卷
  下乡”、“技术人员分项负责”等办法，迅速处理、鉴定、试验了上万件的建议。新工具如雨后春笋般的出现了。仅1958年7至9月份即创造各种形式的新工具四十二种，一千一百二十五件。这些新工具分别采用了“杠杆”“滑轮”“斜坡”等机械原理，使劳动效率大大提高。
    新工具创造出来后，接着掀起了大量制造和推广新工具的高潮。在数以千件的工具制造中，又坚持了“白手起家，自力更生，自制自使”的原则。段内三十九个工区都建立了“小土群”工具制造厂。群众自己垒起小烘炉，没有风箱就从自己家中拿，没有铁工就自己寻师访友学技术，缺乏材料就开展了献料运动。一个一个的困难都得到解决。
    半机械化实现了，但并不等于万事大吉了。一方面，大量新工具都是在很短的时间内创制出来的，难免有些粗糙，需要不断的提高。因此，介休工务段发动群众对新工具进行了群众性的鉴定工作，使新工具更臻完善。另一方面，更重要的是，工具改革后，原有的生产组织、作业过程、工时定额、操作规程大都不相适应了，要求经营管理工作迅速跟上去。介休工务段针对这个新的情况及时加强了管理，使半机械化的成果得以巩固。
    介休工务段加强基层管理，首先从查定工时定额入手，以便在使用新工具的情况下紧密工序，正常的组织生产。查定定额的作法是：“专业查定与群众查定相结合”，“查定技术高的与查定技术低的相结合”，“查定与统计相结合”。群众参加查定并对查定的结果进行讨论，是查定中贯彻群众路线的主要方法。经过查定，重新制定了九十六项新定额，新定额施行后，又反过来促进了工具的再改革，如太谷工区就又创造了新的拐把扒渣机。
    工具改革后缺乏一套适合于新工具的操作规程，阻滞着工人迅速掌握新工具的技术。介休工务段在查定工时定额的同时解决了这个问题。在查定工时定额时，分析了效率高低不同的原因，归纳了先进工人的操作方法，经过取长补短，去粗存精，总结成一套单项作业要领，订成规程，并提练成工人易学好记的简短口诀，给落后赶先进，从技术上找到了门径。在深入贯彻单项操作规程中，介休工务段采用了多种多样的形式，如边干边学的火线练兵运动，比武选拔能手运动，示范表演，师带徒等等。练兵鉴定的结果有89％的工人合了格，二百零三个新工人达到三等养路工水平，并涌现出五十名单项操作能手。
    由于实现了养路半机械化，现在介休工务段养护的线路做到了轨面平坦，方向园顺，路容美观，水沟畅通，标志齐全，无高低接头，无腐朽的枕木群，使行车速度提高了42.4％。我们有决心把铁路养护得更好，让跃进列车滚滚向前。
