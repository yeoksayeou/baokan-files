Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch from Tokyo: A rally with one thousand people participating was held yesterday in Tokyo by the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party. Attendees listened to the report from the Japanese Communist Party delegation on their visit to China. Nosaka Sanzo, head of the Japanese Communist Party delegation and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, emphasized in his report that the joint statement issued by the Chinese and Japanese Communist Parties in Beijing on October 20 clearly pointed out the correct path for the Japanese people's struggle for national independence, peace, neutrality, and democracy.
    Nosaka called on all members of the Japanese Communist Party and all Japanese people to launch struggles following the path indicated by the statement.
    Nosaka pointed out that as long as Japanese Communist Party members abide by the glorious traditions of the Japanese Communist Party, adhere to the correct path pointed out in the joint statement of the Chinese and Japanese Communist Parties, and launch struggles together with the people, they will be able to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
