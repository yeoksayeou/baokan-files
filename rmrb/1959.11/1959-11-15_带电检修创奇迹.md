Heroic Tales in Verse:

    Creating Miracles with Live-Line Maintenance
    Climbing to the tip of the iron tower,
    Body in the white clouds,
    Shouting to the God of Thunder and Lightning:
    Get out of the way!
    We want to work – without a power outage!
    The God of Thunder trembled,
    And hurriedly called the Goddess of Lightning.
    The Goddess of Lightning floated before him:
    My lord, don’t be surprised,
    This is the workers’ soaring energy breaking through the sky!

This is a poem written by the workers of the Anshan Power Supply Bureau, an advanced collective attending the National Congress of Heroes, describing their drive. The Anshan Power Supply Bureau is the central hub of the Northeast Power Grid, responsible for supplying electricity to industry and agriculture in the Anshan, Liaoyang, and Haicheng areas. All the employees of the bureau deeply understand that if an accident occurs in the power supply department and the current stops, it will affect factory and mine production and the people's lives. Especially since the Great Leap Forward last year, industrial and agricultural production has been continuously leaping forward, requiring a significant increase in electricity. Therefore, ensuring safe operation has become an important aspect of increasing production and practicing economy in the power supply department. To achieve safe operation, it is necessary to conduct frequent inspections and eliminate defects immediately. However, in the past, maintenance often required a power outage. To avoid power outages affecting production, all employees of the plant studied advanced Soviet experience and creatively learned and mastered the method of live-line maintenance, achieving more power supply, safe power supply, and strongly supporting the industrial and agricultural leap forward.

### 带电检修创奇迹

    带电检修创奇迹
    爬上铁塔尖，
    身在白云端，
    喝声雷公电母：
    躲开！
    我们要作业——不停电！
    雷公听了直打颤，
    急忙来把电母喊。
    电母飘飞到跟前：
    相爷，莫惊愕，
    这是工人干劲冲破天！
    这是出席全国群英会的先进集体——鞍山供电局的工人们在描述自己干劲时写下的诗篇。鞍山供电局是东北电力网的中枢点，负责鞍（山）辽（阳）海（城）地区的工农业用电。全局职工深深知道，如果供电部门发生事故，电流停止了，就会影响到厂矿生产和人民生活。特别是去年大跃进以来，工农业生产都在不断跃进，需要电力大大增加，因此，保证安全运行就成为供电部门增产节约的重要内容。要做到安全运行，就要勤检查，发现缺陷，立即清除。但是，过去检修，往往要停下电来。为了避免停电影响生产，全厂职工学习了苏联先进经验，终于创造性地学会和掌握了不停电检修方法，做到了多供电，安全供电，有力地支持了工农业跃进。
