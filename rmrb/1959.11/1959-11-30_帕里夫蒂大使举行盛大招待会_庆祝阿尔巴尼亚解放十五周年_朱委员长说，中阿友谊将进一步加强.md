On behalf of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, he extended the warmest congratulations to the People's Republic of Albania and the Albanian people, praising the Albanian people's indomitable fighting spirit and their brilliant achievements in socialist construction.

Hermann Quiroga Galdo, former Speaker of the House of Representatives of Bolivia and current member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives, who is currently visiting China, was also invited to attend the reception.

The grand reception was held at the Beijing Hotel. The national flags of China and Albania were hung on the rostrum, and the front of the stage was filled with flowers. A warm and friendly atmosphere permeated the reception.

Ambassador Plevriti spoke first at the reception. He said that today's Albania has become a free and independent socialist country with a developed economy and culture, and it is worthy of being an active member of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Albanian Labor Party, based on the specific conditions of our country, creatively applies the immortal doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, defends and will more resolutely defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism from the harm of all enemies, especially modern revisionism.

The Ambassador said that the achievements of the Albanian people are the result of the great friendship and close cooperation of the socialist camp countries, and the result of the constant fraternal assistance given to the Albanian people by the socialist countries, especially the Soviet people.

The Ambassador said that the Albanian people are deeply convinced that the great brotherly Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the tested Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, will surely victoriously complete their tasks, thereby making a great contribution not only to the cause of socialist construction in their own country but also to the overall consolidation of our entire socialist camp.

Chairman Zhu De then spoke, warmly praising Albania's unremitting efforts to safeguard peace in Europe and the world. He particularly emphasized: "The Albanian people have made outstanding contributions to the struggle to maintain and consolidate the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to defend Marxism-Leninism, and to criticize modern revisionism."

When talking about the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Albania, Chairman Zhu De said, we firmly believe that the unbreakable and profound friendship between the people of China and Albania will be further developed in the future, and our mutual support and cooperation in all aspects will be further strengthened.

The speeches of Ambassador Plevriti and Chairman Zhu De (full text on page four) were warmly welcomed. After their speeches, the national anthems of China and Albania were played in the banquet hall.

The joyful grand reception lasted for two hours. Chinese and foreign guests attending the reception constantly toasted Ambassador Plevriti, congratulating the heroic Albanian people on their glorious festival.
