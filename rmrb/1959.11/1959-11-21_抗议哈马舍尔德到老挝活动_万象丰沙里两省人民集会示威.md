Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th: According to the "Lao Patriotic Newspaper," officers and soldiers of the Lao Patriotic Forces, local people, and guerrillas in Vientiane Province and Phongsaly Province, Laos, recently held several rallies and demonstrations to protest against the activities of United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld in Laos and the establishment of a "Permanent Representative" in Laos.

The newspaper reported on the 16th that the participants in these rallies and demonstrations adopted resolutions demanding that U.S. imperialism stop interfering in Laos, and condemning the practice of abusing the name of the United Nations to interfere in Laos' internal affairs. The resolutions also demanded that the Phoui Sananikone government stop the civil war, cancel the "trial" of Prince Souphanouvong and other imprisoned leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, and restore their freedom.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th: Vientiane dispatch: After carrying out activities in Laos for seven days, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld left Vientiane on the 19th. Hammarskjöld held talks with Lao Prime Minister Sananikone in Vientiane, with the aim of seeking ways for the United States to further interfere in Laos through the United Nations. Subsequently, he telegraphed UN Under-Secretary-General Toumioja to Vientiane to remain in Laos under the name of so-called UN "Special Representative" as a step to promote this illegal interference.

    抗议哈马舍尔德到老挝活动
    万象丰沙里两省人民集会示威
    新华社河内20日电　据“老挝爱国报”报道，老挝万象省和丰沙里省的寮国战斗部队官兵、当地人民和游击队最近举行了几次集会和示威，抗议联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德到老挝活动和他在老挝设置“常驻代表”。
    这家报纸在16日报道，这些集会和示威的参加者通过决议，要求美帝国主义停止干涉老挝，并且谴责滥用联合国的名义来干涉老挝内政的做法。决议还要求培·萨纳尼空政府停止内战，取消对苏发努冯亲王和其它被监禁的老挝爱国战线党领袖的“审判”，并且恢复他们的自由。
    据新华社河内20日电　万象消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在老挝进行了七天活动后，已经在19日离开万象。哈马舍尔德在万象同老挝首相萨纳尼空进行了会谈，会谈的目的在于为美国利用联合国进一步干涉老挝寻求途径。随后，他电召联合国副秘书长杜米奥雅到万象，以所谓联合国“特别代表”的名义留在老挝，作为推行这种非法干涉的一个步骤。
