    Crocodile Tears
    Legend: The crocodile sheds tears of pity for the animals it has captured. Hence the idiom "crocodile tears." Anyone who hypocritically expresses pity for others is described as shedding "crocodile tears."
    Recently, Swedish scientist Ragnar Fänge and his assistant proved that crocodiles can indeed cry and shed tears. Of course, the tears are not due to pity but to excrete excess salt from their bodies. There is a lacrimal gland next to the crocodile's eyeball, which secretes tears, and excess salt is excreted with the tears. Many lizard-like animals have this organ for regulating salt levels.

    鳄鱼的眼泪
    传说：鳄鱼对自己所俘获的动物怜悯地落泪。于是便有了“鳄鱼泪”这个典故。凡是假惺惺地对别人表示怜悯的人都形容为：他流“鳄鱼泪”了。
    近来瑞典科学家拉格纳尔·芬盖及其助手证明：鳄鱼真能哭泣并淌下眼泪。当然流泪不是由于怜悯而是为了要从自己体内排出过剩的盐。在鳄鱼眼球旁边有一道泪腺，泪腺分泌泪液，而过剩的盐随着泪液排出体外。许多蜥蜴类动物都有这种调节盐量的器官。
