Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 7th. The struggle of the Panamanian people against the United States and for canal rights continues to escalate. According to Latin American News Agency reports, opposition parties in Panama have decided to organize a Front for Panamanian Rights. The purpose of establishing this organization is to assist the government in carrying out work beneficial to the Republic of Panama. Recently, a serious situation has arisen between the two countries due to the insult to the Panamanian flag by the US authorities and military.

    The Panamanian University Federation issued a statement condemning the aggression of US imperialism and the act of insulting the Panamanian flag.

    The University Federation's statement stated that American aggression "has further strengthened the determination of the Panamanian people to demand the nationalization of the canal." The statement also opposed the economic boycott of Panama being carried out in the Canal Zone.

    Major cities in Panama held demonstrations protesting the American insult to "national dignity." Fearing the rising anti-American sentiment of the Panamanian people, US officials Arnold Schaffer and Bo Berry had to sneak into Tucuman Airport in Panama.

    Panamanian newspapers strongly protested against American aggression, accusing the US Governor of the Canal Zone, William Potter, and the US Ambassador of being the main direct instigators of the two bloody incidents that occurred during the demonstrations held by Panamanians a few days ago. Panamanian newspapers demanded their removal from office.

    不能容忍美国霸占运河
    巴拿马人民继续示威
    新华社哈瓦那7日电　巴拿马反对美国和争取运河权益的斗争继续高涨。据拉丁美洲通讯社报道，巴拿马反对派各政党决定组织一个争取巴拿马权利阵线，建立这个组织的目的是协助政府进行有利于巴拿马共和国的工作。最近，由于美国当局和军队侮辱巴拿马国旗造成了两国间的严重形势。
    巴拿马大学联合会发表声明，谴责美帝国主义的侵略和侮辱巴拿马国旗的行动。
    大学联合会的声明表示：美国的侵略“更加坚定了巴拿马人民要求运河国有化的决心”。声明并且反对在运河区进行的对巴拿马的经济抵制。
    巴拿马各主要城市举行了抗议美国侮辱“国家尊严”的示威游行。慑于巴拿马人民高涨的反美情绪，美国官员阿诺德·谢弗和布·贝里不得不悄悄地溜到巴拿马的图库曼机场。
    巴拿马报纸强烈抗议美国的侵略，指责运河区的美国总督威廉·波特和美国大使是前几天巴拿马人举行示威时发生两次血腥事件的主要直接策动者。巴拿马报纸要求撤除他们的职务。
