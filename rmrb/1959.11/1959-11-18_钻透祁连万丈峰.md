Heroic Oil Extraction Record

	Drilling Through the Myriad Peaks of the Qilian Mountains
	In the Yumen Oilfield, if anyone asks about the Sun Defu drilling team, people will tell you with praise: "Our Sun Defu drilling team is truly a red flag that never fades."
	Since its establishment in 1955, the Sun Defu drilling team has overfulfilled the state plan every year. In five years, it has drilled eleven deep wells for the country, with a total footage of more than 27,700 meters, which is more than 2,200 meters more than the total footage drilled by the Yumen Oil Mine in the ten years before liberation.
	Inspired by the slogan of developing the motherland's petroleum resources more, faster, better, and more economically, the Sun Defu drilling team has been working diligently in the remote mountains and wilderness year after year, undaunted by hardship. They always try every means to increase drilling speed and never easily let go of every second of drilling time. In July of this year, while drilling in Ya'er Gorge, it suddenly rained one night, and floods from the mountains poured down with mud, sand, and stones. In an instant, the mud pump pit next to the derrick became a pool of water. The belt kept slipping, and they were about to be forced to stop drilling. However, if they stopped drilling at this time, the drill bit would surely get stuck in the well, causing the oil well to be scrapped. At this critical moment, Deputy Captain Zhang Zhenhua immediately jumped into the chest-deep water pit, followed by more than a dozen workers, braving the heavy rain to dig drainage ditches in the icy water pit. After more than two hours of hard work, they finally overcame the flood and ensured continued normal drilling. On one occasion, the drilling rig hit a brine layer, and the mud needed to be mixed with barite to suppress the brine. If barite was not added in time, the brine would spray upwards, and the well wall would be corroded by the brine and collapse, causing the well to be scrapped in vain. However, the truck transporting the barite broke down on the road. In order to rescue the oil well, the workers worked consecutive shifts regardless of fatigue and insisted on carrying ten tons of barite from a place two miles away from the well site to the well site at more than one o'clock in the morning. A serious accident was prevented by them.
	In order to drill more wells, drill faster, and produce more oil, the workers of the Sun Defu drilling team have been working diligently in this way for four years. Last November, they accepted the task of supporting the central Sichuan oil area. The entire team put forward the fighting slogan of "We will never give up until we take down the central Sichuan oil field," and completed a deep well, originally planned to take two months, in thirty days. After the first well was completed, they moved that night in the pouring rain. They moved the three kilometers in one day, installed the machines in two days, and started drilling on the fourth day, creating a new record for well relocation. After completing the task in the central Sichuan oil area, they returned to the foot of the Qilian Mountains. The entire team once again put forward the slogan of "No rest upon arrival at the mine, go into battle immediately," and immediately plunged into the battle of Ya'er Gorge. They are determined to drill through the Qilian Mountains and open up more oil depots for the motherland.

    钻透祁连万丈峰
    在玉门油区，谁要问起孙德福钻进队，人们都会用一种赞美的口吻告诉你：“咱们孙德福钻井队呀，可真是算得上一面不褪色的红旗。”
    孙德福钻井队从1955年成立以来。年年超额完成国家计划，五年的时间内，已为国家钻成了十一口深井，总进尺达二万七千七百多米，比玉门油矿解放前十年进尺的总和还要多出二千二百多米。
    孙德福钻井队在多快好省地开发祖国石油资源的口号鼓舞下，全队成年累月地在深山旷野里不畏艰苦，勤勤恳恳地工作着。他们总是千方百计地提高钻速，从不轻易放过分秒钻进时间。今年7月在鸭儿峡钻井时，一天夜里，突然下起雨来了，山上下来的洪水，带着泥沙石子滚滚泻来，刹那间，井架旁边的泥浆泵坑就变成了水潭。皮带不住地打滑，眼看就要被迫停钻。但是，这时停下钻来，钻头准得卡在井里，造成油井报废事故。在这千钧一发之际，副队长张振华立即纵身跳进齐胸的水坑，接着，十几个工人也跳了下去，冒着大雨，在冰凉的水坑里挖起排水沟来。经过两个多小时的苦战，终于战胜了洪水，保证了继续正常钻进。有一次，钻机打到了盐水层，泥浆里需要掺重晶石把盐水压住，不及时掺进重晶石，盐水就会往上喷，井壁受了盐水浸蚀，就会塌下来，使这口井白白报废。而拉运重晶石的汽车又在路上抛锚了。为了抢救油井，工人们不顾疲劳，主动连班工作，在深夜一点多钟，坚持从离井场两里外的地方将十吨重晶石搬到了井场。一场严重的事故被他们制止了。
    为了多打井，快打井，多出油，孙德福钻井队的工人们就这样四年如一日地勤恳劳动着。去年11月，他们接受了支援川中油区的任务，全队就提出了“不拿下川中油田誓不罢休”的战斗口号，用三十天就打完了一口原计划要两个月才能完成的深井。第一口井打完后，他们当晚就冒着倾盆大雨搬家。三公里的距离，一天就搬完家，两天就安装好机器，第四天就开钻，创造了迁井搬家的新纪录。川中油区任务完成后，他们又回到了祁连山下，全队又提出了“到矿不休息，马上就上阵”的口号，立即投入鸭儿峡的战斗。立志要钻透祁连山，为祖国打开更多的油库。
