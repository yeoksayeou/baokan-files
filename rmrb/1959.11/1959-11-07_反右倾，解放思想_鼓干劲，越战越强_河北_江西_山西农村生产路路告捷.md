    Oppose Rightism, Liberate Thought, Boost Morale, Become Stronger in Battle
    Hebei, Jiangxi, and Shanxi Rural Production Achieves Success on All Fronts
    (Our Dispatch) Since Hebei Province began opposing Rightism and boosting morale, the political and production situation in the countryside has become increasingly good.
    This year, Hebei Province's autumn harvest progress is half a month faster than last year, and the harvesting and threshing are meticulous; combining the autumn harvest with land clearing and plowing, the province has basically completed the sowing of more than 30 million mu of winter wheat (of which more than 11 million mu have reached the requirements of ridge fields and garden-like fields); more than 2 million strong laborers throughout the province have invested in water conservancy construction; the number of laborers specializing in and combining other activities to participate in fertilizer accumulation is no less than 2 million; and sideline production has also been carried out on a large scale in conjunction with other production.
    Hebei Province's agricultural production is not only advancing across the board, but also achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results. This year's water conservancy construction upsurge is about a month earlier than last year, and the quality is high and the results are great; the wheat planting work is not only twice as fast as last year, but the quality has also greatly surpassed last year. Last year, wheat fields with water conservancy conditions accounted for more than one-third, this year it has exceeded half; last year, wheat fields with base fertilizer accounted for about two-thirds, this year it has reached more than 90%, and the quantity is large and the quality is good; the area of deep-plowed wheat fields has greatly exceeded last year, and high-yield fields are 3 million mu more than last year.
    The competition movement of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced is like a rising wind and surging clouds, and the forms and scope of the competition are numerous and broad. As soon as wheat planting began, Anguo, Xingtai and other counties proposed a wheat high-yield competition to the province, and more than two-thirds of the communes and teams in the province quickly responded to the proposal. In the Tangshan Special Zone, 21,213 production teams in 112 communes have all made high-yield plans and participated in the competition movement.
    Opposing Rightism and boosting morale have made the relationship between industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military departments closer. Many regions have adopted methods such as joint offices, joint office groups, or command posts in industrial, agricultural, commercial and other departments to further twist the strength of the departments into one rope. In carrying out the water conservancy movement, the industrial department of Jiaohe County organized more than 1,500 workers to carry out a production competition to support agriculture. It quickly processed more than 500 sets of well-drilling tools, repaired 134 sets of drainage and irrigation machinery and more than 2,000 waterwheels, and traveled to the countryside to go deep into the fields and construction sites to help production teams repair and equip machinery in a timely manner. According to statistics from XuShui, Hengshui and other counties, during the water conservancy movement, 100,000 tools, more than 800 cubic meters of timber, and 990 tons of steel bars, cement, sand, asphalt and other water conservancy construction materials were prepared.
    In the production movement, leaders at all levels pay attention to grasping the lives of the masses, which is a characteristic. The province has rectified and restored about 100,000 canteens, so that more than 11 million laborers can concentrate more on participating in production. In order to ensure that the masses work well and rest well, Handan Special Zone alone built more than 32,000 rest sheds for commune members in the fields. This has made commune members stronger in battle, more enthusiastic, and their enthusiasm for production has continued to be high. Another feature of the movement is to summarize each battle to ensure that the movement develops wave after wave. In the wheat planting movement, Ji County extracted more than a dozen county party committees, with the high-yield formula as the core, to contract in pieces, command 200,000 laborers to complete the sowing task in a timely manner, and then immediately used five days to hold summary meetings at all levels to check the problems and propose the task of storing water and watering wheat.
    The Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has put forward the call to work hard for three to five years to fundamentally change the face of agricultural production. Party committees at all levels in the province have organized propaganda troops to deeply convey the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the tasks put forward by the Provincial Party Committee. The province's peasants are in high spirits, full of vigor, and determined to continue to work hard to achieve continuous advances in agriculture.
    (Our Dispatch) The Party issued a call to oppose Rightism and boost morale, which formed an overwhelming force in the rural areas of Jiangxi. At present, a good situation has emerged in the province's rural areas, with all-round leaps forward in all production, victories on all fronts, and vigorous work of all kinds.
    This year, Jiangxi's more than 22 million mu of early rice has increased by about 20% in unit area yield compared with last year; 19.7 million mu of late rice is golden, and the heavy ears of grain sway in the wind, and the output exceeding early rice is a foregone conclusion. In the current competition movement of late rice exceeding early rice, the vast number of commune members in the province are stationed in the fields, striving to apply fertilizer to late rice once more and weed once more. In the past, after the late management of late rice, it was a slack farming season; this year, while strengthening the management of late rice, winter planting and autumn harvest preparations are being carried out, and a movement to build water conservancy, accumulate and make fertilizer, and develop diversified operations has been launched.
    Under this enthusiastic leap forward situation, some cadres in some areas still have some Rightist sentiments. They believe that the overall leap forward in various productions is "too tight" and "labor cannot be arranged," and they do not actively try to overcome difficulties. These Rightist sentiments have been criticized by the broad masses of people, who have tried every means to improve labor organization, reform tools, organize collaboration, and fully tap labor potential. Now, more than 1,500 water conservancy projects have started construction in the province, and more than 8 million cubic meters of earth and stone have been completed; fertilizer accumulation has reached 1 billion dan, 570,000 mu of lake fields and state-owned land have been reclaimed, diversified operations have become a mass movement, and winter planting has completed 13.2 million mu. While carrying out these tasks, the autumn harvest preparation work has not been affected.
    With the deepening development of the movement to oppose Rightism and boost morale, the revolutionary heroism of the broad masses of people has been fully developed, and the socialist competition is in full swing. The "three super" competition movement of late rice exceeding early rice, late soybeans exceeding early soybeans, and sesame exceeding rapeseed in Yichun Special Zone has been attended by 1 million people. Recently, this special zone has launched a new "three super" competition movement of wheat exceeding Jinxian, rapeseed exceeding Yichun, and green manure exceeding Pingxiang, with 1.4 million participants, and the competition content includes sowing quality, field management, etc. The competition makes various productions like the front waves of the Yangtze River pushing the back waves, one wave higher than the other, so as to achieve continuous leaps forward.
    In the fourth quarter, the three autumn tasks in rural areas are tight, and the preparatory work for the leap forward next year is arduous, and there are difficulties on the road ahead. However, in the struggle to oppose Rightism and boost morale, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of people has been unprecedentedly high, and as long as we actively lead and arrange correctly, we can overcome all difficulties. Now, the vast number of peasants in Jiangxi are full of fearless spirit, and have overwhelmed the Rightist sentiments of fearing difficulties and shouting difficulties in vain. (Li Jiuzhe)
    (Our Dispatch) In Shanxi Province, autumn grain crops have been basically harvested, 70% have been put on the market and the harvesting has ended; the picked seed cotton has reached more than 350 million jin. The overall autumn harvest progress is faster and of better quality than in any previous year.
    This year, Shanxi Province suffered severe drought and flood disasters, but after the hard work of the province's peasants, a bumper harvest was finally achieved. Jinbei, Jinzhong and other regions have increased by about 20% compared with last year.
    The province's winter wheat sowing area has completed 98% of the state plan, expanding the wheat area sown in autumn by 2 million mu compared with last year. The average fertilizer application per mu of wheat fields in the province has increased by more than 30 dan compared with last year, two-thirds of the wheat fields have been deep-plowed, the area of irrigated wheat fields has been expanded by 1 million mu, and the large area of 2 million mu of high-yield fields has initially realized garden-like cultivation, basically eliminating the phenomenon of sowing wheat after "frost drop." At present, the wheat seedling emergence rate is higher than in previous years, and the amount of missing seedlings is less than in previous years, which is the most powerful proof of the good quality of this year's wheat sowing.
    The province-wide "small autumn harvest" movement is in full swing, and now the number of male, female, old and young commune members who have invested in this movement has reached 2 million. The province's commune sideline income has expanded more than twice as much as the total income of the whole year last year, and this year the province's diversified economic income plus agricultural income can increase by 20% compared with last year.
    The fact that Shanxi Province's three autumn tasks and other tasks can be carried out simultaneously, and everything is good, is a major victory for fully exerting the superiority of the people's commune and the timely proposal of opposing Rightism and boosting morale by the Party Central Committee. In the past, every autumn in the countryside, the autumn harvest, wheat planting, and autumn plowing were crowded together, often causing people to lose sight of one another. Now, the people's commune has unified leadership and unified planning, coupled with the fact that leaders at all levels of the commune have grasped the law of comprehensively leading rural production, agricultural work is arranged well, and labor is used rationally, so that multiple agricultural tasks can advance across the board. With the improvement of the production organization and system of the commune, the enthusiasm of the masses has been fully developed, so that the quality of agricultural work has been continuously improved. In particular, vigorously carrying out mass movements and launching red, diligent, and skillful labor competitions throughout the province has not only resulted in high work efficiency and high quality, but also the political enthusiasm and communist style of the vast number of cadres have been unprecedentedly high. On the basis of inserting red flags, erecting pacesetters, and the competition of you surpassing me, a upsurge of mutual assistance has also emerged in many regions. Due to the development of large-scale collaboration, the area of large-scale high-yield wheat garden fields in 19 communes in Tunchang County has expanded to 200,000 mu this year, more than three times more than last year. By mid-October, 75 management districts in Zuoquan County had completed the autumn plowing task, but 52 management districts in the county were still slower due to the large number of people and animals and the small progress. Therefore, the county launched a large-scale collaborative shock autumn plowing movement. The faster ones helped the slower ones, the ones with more livestock helped the ones with less, the large management districts helped the small management districts, and the advanced units helped the backward units, so that the autumn plowing task in the county could be completed 20 days ahead of schedule.

    反右倾，解放思想　鼓干劲，越战越强
    河北  江西  山西农村生产路路告捷
    本报讯　河北省反右倾鼓干劲以来，农村的政治形势和生产形势越来越好。
    今年河北省秋收进度，比去年加快了半个月，而且收打精细；结合秋收边腾地、边耕翻，目前基本上完成了三千多万亩冬麦的播种任务（其中一千一百多万亩达到畦田化和园田化的要求）；全省已有二百多万壮劳力，投入了水利建设运动；全省专业和结合其他活动参加积肥的劳力，也不下二百万人；副业生产也结合其他生产大规模地开展起来。
    河北省的农业生产不仅全面跃进，而且作到了多、快、好、省。今年的水利建设高潮大约比去年提前了一个月，而且质量高收效大；种麦工作不仅进度比去年快一倍，质量也大大超过去年。去年有水利条件的麦田，占三分之一以上，今年已超过一半；去年施底肥的麦田约占三分之二，今年则达到90％以上，并且量多质好；深耕的麦田面积，大大超过去年，高额丰产田比去年多三百万亩。
    学先进赶先进超先进的竞赛运动有如风起云涌，竞赛的形式和范围又多又广。种麦刚开始，安国、邢台等县向全省提出了小麦丰产竞赛，全省三分之二以上的社队，很快就响应了倡议。唐山专区一百一十二个公社的两万一千二百一十三个生产小队，都作出了丰产计划，参加了竞赛运动。
    反右倾、鼓干劲，使工农商学兵各部门的关系更加密切。许多地区工业、农业、商业等部门，采取联合办公、合组办公室或指挥部等办法，把各部门的力量进一步拧成了一股劲。交河县的工业部门在开展水利运动中，组织起一千五百多名工人，开展支援农业的生产竞赛活动，很快就加工出五百多套打机井的工具，修好一百三十四台排灌机械和两千多台水车，并且巡回下乡，深入田间工地，及时帮助生产队修配机具。据徐水、衡水等县统计，在水利运动当中，即备好了十万件工具、八百多方木材和九百九十吨钢筋、水泥、砂子、沥青等水利建设器材。
    在生产运动中，各级领导注意抓群众生活，这是一个特点。全省整顿和恢复了约十万个食堂，使一千一百多万名劳力，能够更集中精力参加生产。为了保证群众劳动好休息好，仅邯郸一个专区，就为社员在田野搭了三万二千多个休息棚。这样就使社员越战越强，越干劲越猛，生产热情持续高涨。运动的另一个特点是打一仗总结一仗，保证运动一浪高一浪地向前发展。蓟县在种麦运动中，抽出十几名县委以丰产方为核心，分片包干，指挥二十万劳力及时完成播种任务后，立即以五天的时间，逐级召开总结会议，检查了问题，提出了蓄水浇麦的任务。
    中共河北省委已经提出了苦战三、五年，根本改变农业生产面貌的号召。全省各级党委都组织了宣传大军，深入传达党中央八届八中全会精神和省委提出的任务。全省农民精神振奋，意气风发，决心继续大干，实现农业的不断跃进。
    本报讯　党发出反右倾鼓干劲的号召，在江西农村中形成了一股排山倒海的力量。目前，全省农村出现各项生产全面跃进，各条战线路路告捷，各种工作生气勃勃的大好局面。
    今年江西二千二百多万亩早稻，单位面积产量约比去年增长20％；一千九百七十万亩晚稻一片金黄，重甸甸的谷穗迎风摆动，产量超过早稻已成定局。在目前晚稻超早稻的竞赛运动中，全省广大社员扎寨田间，争取为晚稻多施一次肥，多锄一遍草。往年，晚稻后期管理结束后，是一段农闲时间；今年，在加强晚稻管理的同时，进行着冬种和秋收准备工作，掀起了兴修水利、积肥造肥、多种经营的运动。
    在这群情振奋的跃进形势下，某些地区的部分干部却仍然存在一些右倾情绪。他们认为各项生产全面跃进“太紧张”，“劳动力无法安排”，不积极设法克服困难。这些右倾情绪遭到了广大群众的批判，人们想方设法改善劳动组织，改革工具，组织协作，充分挖掘劳动潜力。现在，全省有一千五百多座水利工程开了工，并已完成土石方八百多万公方；积肥造肥达十亿担，已开垦湖田洲地五十七万亩，多种经营已成为群众性的运动，冬种已完成一千三百二十万亩。在进行这些工作的同时，秋收准备工作并没有受到影响。
    随着反右倾、鼓干劲运动的深入发展，广大群众的革命英雄主义得到充分地发扬，社会主义竞赛热气腾腾。宜春专区晚稻超早稻、晚大豆超早大豆、芝麻超油菜的“三超”竞赛运动，参加人数达一百万人。最近，这个专区又掀起了小麦超进贤，油菜超宜春，绿肥超萍乡的新“三超”竞赛运动，参加的人数达到一百四十万人，竞赛内容有播种质量、田间管理等。竞赛使各项生产有如长江前浪推后浪，一浪高一浪，从而实现不断的跃进。
    第四季度，农村三秋工作紧张，为明年跃进而正在进行的各项准备工作任务艰巨，前进道路上是有困难的。但是，在反右倾，鼓干劲的斗争中，广大群众革命积极性空前高涨，只要积极领导，正确安排，就可以战胜一切困难。现在，江西广大农民充满了大无畏的精神，已经压倒了那种害怕困难、空喊困难的右倾情绪。（李久泽）
    本报讯　山西省秋粮作物已经基本割完，70％已经上场和收打结束；已收摘籽棉达三亿五千多万斤。整个秋收进度比以往任何一年快，质量好。
    山西省今年旱涝灾害严重，但经过全省农民苦战巧干，终于获得了大丰收。晋北、晋中等地区都比去年增产二成左右。
    全省冬小麦播种面积，已经完成了国家计划的98％，比去年秋种小麦面积扩大了二百万亩。全省麦田平均每亩施肥量比去年增加了三十多担，有三分之二的麦田进行了深耕，扩大水地麦田一百万亩，二百多万亩大面积丰产田初步实现耕作园田化，基本上消灭了“霜降”后种麦的现象。目前麦田出苗率比往年增加，缺苗量比往年减少，这是今年小麦播种质量好的最有力的证明。
    全省性的“小秋收”运动正在轰轰烈烈进行，现在投入这一运动的男女老少社员已达二百万人。全省公社副业收入已比去年全年总收入扩大了二倍多，今年全省多种经济加农业收入可以比去年增加20％。
    山西省三秋工作以及其它工作能够同时进行，而且样样都好，是充分发挥人民公社优越性和党中央及时提出反右倾鼓干劲后的重大胜利。过去，农村每当秋季，秋收、种麦、秋耕拥在一起，往往是顾此失彼。现在，人民公社统一领导、统一规划，再加上公社各级领导摸到了全面领导农村生产的规律，农活安排好，劳力使用合理，使多项农活能够全面跃进。随着公社生产组织、制度的健全，充分地发挥了群众的积极性，使农活质量得到不断提高。特别是大搞群众运动，全省开展红、勤、巧劳动竞赛，不仅出现了高工效、高质量，而且广大干部政治热情和共产主义风格也空前高涨。许多地区在插红旗、树标兵、你超我赶的竞赛基础上，又出现了相互帮助的热潮。屯长县十九个公社由于开展大协作，今年小麦园田化大面积高产田面积扩大到二十万亩，比去年扩大了三倍多。左权县到10月中旬已有七十五个管理区完成了秋耕任务，但全县仍有五十二个管理区由于地多人畜少进度较慢，于是全县开展了大协作突击秋耕运动。进度快的帮慢的、畜力多的帮少的、大管理区帮小管理区、先进单位帮落后单位，这样全县秋耕任务可以提前二十天完成。
