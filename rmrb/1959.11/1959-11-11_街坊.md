Neighbors

Wen Xin

I live in a large ward with two large south-facing glass windows, providing ample light, good ventilation, and comfort and warmth. The patients have all passed the acute phase and are peacefully receiving treatment, so the atmosphere in the ward is very lively, with lots of talking and laughing, and no painful groans.

This afternoon, a new patient came to the empty bed next to me. She was about forty years old, very thin, and had a sallow complexion. She was being supported by a young daughter-in-law. After the patient lay down, she urged the daughter-in-law to go home, saying repeatedly that she would only be in the hospital for a week before being discharged. The daughter-in-law straightened the patient's bedsheets and comforted her, "Auntie, don't worry! Get well, your health is a blessing for the children. If something happens to you, wouldn't the children suffer even more?" The patient's eyes flashed with tears as she nodded repeatedly, "Oh! Those two of yours are enough to keep you busy!" After a moment, she continued, "Tell the older two to heat up their own food when they get home from school, don't spoil them. It's just that little one who's too much trouble... I really feel bad...." The daughter-in-law interrupted her, "Don't say that, Auntie, everyone has difficulties, we're just helping each other, aren't we? Is there anything else you need? I should go back now."

The patient in bed three, a warm-hearted older sister, interjected, "You need to bring your own towel, toothbrush, and teacup; it would be convenient to have a thermos." The daughter-in-law nodded, taking note, "Towel, toothbrush, teacup, thermos... I'll ask Uncle to bring them to you tomorrow!"

I lay beside them, listening to their conversation, wondering about their relationship. If they were family, they wouldn't be so polite; but judging by their closeness, they didn't seem like outsiders.

As soon as the young woman left, we were about to strike up a conversation with the new patient, but she spoke first, "Elder sister, do you know what she is to me?" I said with confidence, "Is she your niece-in-law? Are you relatives?" She shook her head, "We're not related at all. She's our neighbor across the street. We've only lived near each other for less than half a year! She's helped me so much!" It turned out that this aunt had fallen ill shortly after giving birth, and acquaintances advised her to see a doctor, but she couldn't bear to leave her three children at home, so she kept putting it off until now. She sighed as she said, "My little one is only three months old and depends entirely on breastfeeding! It's really a lot for her!"

At half past eight in the evening, as the patients were preparing for bed, another new patient arrived, an old woman with white hair. She lay quietly on the cart, without moaning or complaining. Seeing that she was being pushed in a cart, the patients knew she was seriously ill. The patient was accompanied by a man and a woman, who looked like a married couple. The woman looked very sad, standing beside the old woman, not knowing what to do; the man helped the nurse lift the old woman onto the bed and then busied himself with providing a bedpan and finding the doctor. One patient whispered to me that this must be the old woman's daughter and son-in-law, seeing how much the woman resembled the old woman. I thought they were son and daughter-in-law. Look how attentively the man was serving, the old woman was incontinent in her coma, and he busied himself helping the nurse change the sheets. After the doctor and nurse had finished arranging the emergency treatment and left, someone asked the young couple what their relationship was to the old woman. It turned out they were indeed daughter and son-in-law.

Before long, there was a knock on the door, and in came a short-haired girl, with a straight posture, full chest, and very healthy and beautiful. Someone asked her who she was looking for, and she replied, "To see my aunt," as she walked straight to the old woman's bedside. She looked at the old woman and whispered something to the daughter and son-in-law. By this time, I was already feeling tired. I looked at my watch, it was past ten o'clock. The patients were all asleep, and I vaguely heard them discussing who would stay with the old woman overnight. I thought how lucky this old woman was to have so many descendants, and as I thought about it, I fell asleep.

The next morning, we had just finished washing up, it was just after six o'clock, when the short-haired girl came in carrying a covered enamel cup. She looked at us and asked humbly, "Can my aunt drink millet porridge?" The patient in bed three said with certainty, "No, she can only eat the prescribed liquid food." Another patient said, "Go ask the nurse!" She hesitated for a moment, then went out with the cup. She came back a moment later, looking so innocent and happy, and said, "The nurse said she can eat a little!"

After a night of emergency treatment, the old woman was now conscious. The girl sat in front of the old woman's bed and asked softly, "Auntie, do you know where you are?" The old woman must have been very strong before she got sick, because her voice was still quite loud! She said, "This is the hospital, right? I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't find that window on the west side, I was wondering where I was! So we've moved and I didn't even know it. How did I get here?" The girl smiled, "You had such a high fever last night that you didn't know anything. My older brother and sister-in-law brought you here in the car – drink some millet porridge! It was just cooked at home and brought over." The girl fed the old woman with a spoon. Perhaps it was a little hot! She kept pursing her small mouth and blowing on it. The old woman ate one spoonful at a time, and the girl fed her one spoonful at a time. I watched and wondered to myself, the old woman must have always loved this girl the most. When the nurse came to tidy up the bed, the old woman's pillowcase was already wet from the ice pack. The girl gently rested the old woman's head on her wrist before letting the nurse pull the pillow out. A patient asked, "What is the old woman to you?" The girl said, "She's my aunt." The old woman replied at the same time, "We are neighbors."

My heart was filled with emotion for a long time. In the past, neighbors would each sweep the snow from their own doorstep and not care about the frost on others' roofs, but now it's completely changed. In our society today, how brilliantly all the most beautiful human feelings shine in people's hearts!

    街坊
    文心
    我住的是一间大病房，朝南有两扇大玻璃窗户，光线充足，空气流通，舒适而又温暖。病友们都过了急性发作期，在安心地接受治疗，因此病房里的气氛很活跃，有说有笑的，听不到痛苦的呻吟。
    这天下午，我旁边的空床位上来了一位新病人。她约摸有四十来岁，很消瘦，面色焦黄。扶着她的是一个青年媳妇。病人躺下后就催促那媳妇回去，并且口口声声说自己只住一个礼拜就要出院。媳妇给病人整理着被单，劝慰着：“大婶，你放心！好好瞧病，病好了才是孩子们的福气，你要有个好歹，孩子们不是更遭罪吗？”病人眼里闪着泪光连连点头：“唉！你那两个就够你忙的了！”停了一会，她接着说：“大的两个放学回来叫他们自个儿热着吃，你别惯他们。就是那小不点儿太麻烦人……我心里可真不过意……。”那媳妇打断她的话：“可别说这个，大婶，谁还没有困难，还不是互相帮助吗？你还要什么不？我也该回去了。”
    三床病友、一个热心肠的大嫂插嘴道：“要带自个儿的毛巾、牙刷、茶杯；要有暖瓶带一个来用着方便。”那媳妇点头记着：“毛巾、牙刷、茶杯、暖瓶……明儿让大叔给你捎来吧！”
    我躺在旁边听着她们的谈话，揣测着她们的关系。要说是一家人，就不会说那些客气话；可是看她们那亲热劲儿，又不像是外人。
    等那青年妇女一走，我们正要想和这新来的病人攀谈，她却先开了口：“大姐，你知道这是我什么人？”我很有把握地说：“是你侄媳妇？你们是亲戚吧！”她摇摇头说：“半点亲都不沾。是我们隔壁街坊，我们同住还不到半年哪！不晓得帮我多少忙！”原来这大婶生产后不久就病了，熟人都劝她来瞧病，她就放心不下家里三个孩子，就这样，直拖到现在才住院。她说到这里叹了一口气：“我那小不点儿才三个月，全靠喂奶呢！可够她忙的了！”
    晚上八点半钟，病友们正准备就寝，忽然又来了一个新病人，是一位白发苍苍的老太太，她安静地躺在车上，不哼也不嚷。一见是用车推上来的，病友们就知道是重病号。送病人来的是一男一女，看去像是夫妇。女的很忧戚，站在旁边呆呆的不知干什么好；男的帮着护士把老太太抱到病床上，又忙着给放便盆，找大夫。一位病友低低和我说，这一定是老太太的闺女和姑爷，看那女的和老太太长的一个样。我却以为是儿子和儿媳。瞧那男的侍候得多周到，老太太昏迷中大小便失禁，他就忙着帮护士给换床单。等到大夫和护士把急救工作都安排妥当出去后，便有人问这年青夫妇是老太太的什么人，原来还真是闺女和姑爷哩。
    不一会，有人敲门，进来的是一位短发姑娘，挺直的腰身，丰满的胸脯，非常健壮美丽。有人问她找谁，她一面回答：“看我大妈。”一面径直向那老太太床前走去。她看了看老太太，低低的和那闺女和姑爷说着什么。这时我已经感到困乏了，看看表，十点多钟了。病友们都睡觉了，蒙胧中听见他们在商量留谁晚上陪住。我想这老太太福气真好，后辈人不少，想着想着便睡去了。
    第二天清早，我们刚梳洗完，不过六点多钟吧，那短发姑娘就端着一个有盖的洋瓷杯子进来了。她看看我们，谦逊地问道：“我大妈能喝小米粥吗？”三床病友肯定地说：“不行，只能吃指定的流食。”另一病友说：“去问问护士吧！”她迟疑了一下，端着杯子出去了，一会儿又进来，神态那么天真，高兴地说：“护士说可以少吃一点呢！”
    经过一夜抢救，这时，老太太神智已经清楚了。那姑娘坐在老太太床前柔声地问道：“大妈，您知道这是在哪儿？”老太太病前体格一定是很硬朗的，现在说话声音还相当响亮呢！她说：“这是医院嘛！我半夜睡醒，怎么也找不到西面那扇窗户，我说是到哪儿啦！原来搬了家还不知道，我是怎么来的？”姑娘笑了：“昨晚上你烧的都不知事儿了，大哥和嫂子跟车把你送来的——喝点小米粥吧！家里刚熬得就送来的。”姑娘用汤勺喂老太太，许是有点烫吧！她还不停地噘着小嘴吹着。老太太一勺勺吃着，姑娘一勺勺喂着，我看着又在心里捉摸起来，老太太平素准是最疼这姑娘。当护士来整理床铺时，老太太的枕套已被冰袋濡湿了，姑娘轻轻地把老太太的头抵在她的手腕上，然后才让护士把枕头抽出去。一个病友问道：“老太太是你什么人？”姑娘说：“是我大妈。”老太太同时回答：“我们是街坊。”
    我心里久久地激动着。街坊，过去是各人自扫门前雪，休管他人瓦上霜的，现在却完全变了。在我们今天的社会里，一切人间最美好的感情，在人们心灵里闪烁着多么灿烂的光辉！
