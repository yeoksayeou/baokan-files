Teams of healthy, joyful young men and women, arm in arm, march in step past Tiananmen Square, wearing the beautiful costumes of various ethnic groups, as brilliant as rosy clouds and as bright as the clear moon. The great Party and leader reviewed them, and they looked up to the Party and leader with deep affection; the sunlight shines on the lush and flourishing flower bushes, and the flower bushes bask in the glorious and warm sunlight. Our motherland is a big family of many ethnic groups, and the grand occasion in front of Tiananmen is a microcosm of it; the Party and leader lead all ethnic groups, advancing bravely on the fields of the motherland. No matter which grassland or village you enter, even if it's the first time you meet, you won't feel like a stranger; no matter how remote or out-of-the-way the place is, you will always be greeted by smiling relatives. I have stepped on the reeds on the banks of the Ertix River, seen the peaks of the Wuzhi Mountains piercing the clouds, the fountains of the Junggar Basin reflecting the bright moon, and the Lusheng pipes playing joyful tunes by the Hongshui River. Ancient and simple customs are full of poetry, and the brand-new and wonderful life is even more exciting; I want to sing of the miracles that have happened in the past ten years, but I cannot forget that series of memories.

I remember that it was a difficult 1944 when I crossed the Greater Miao Mountains and passed through the border between Guangxi, Guizhou, and Hunan, which was the home of the Dong, Yao, and Miao peoples. Nine out of ten villages were empty, desolate, and sparsely populated; braving the wind and snow, I stepped on the frozen clods on the mountain slopes, climbed over peaks and valleys to reach a village, and suddenly saw a pile of rags slowly walking, the silence around making me panic; if it weren't for the eyes shining in the pile of rags, I wouldn't have been able to tell that she was a Miao girl. Hunger and poverty made the girl disregard her shyness and ask us passers-by for extra clothes; she said that there was only a ragged quilt in her house, which could cover her body but not her parents; the cold wind broke the dry branches, snowflakes danced on the hills, and my heart was as cold as my body. A smart girl cannot be without ideals, but the ideals were strangled and struggling on the line of death; the forests covered the sky, and there were endless treasures underground, but the wealth and the people's blood and sweat fed the tigers and wolves.

I didn't meet this girl again after we parted, but I firmly believe that she is building her hometown, or studying diligently at the Ethnic Minorities Institute, or speaking eloquently in the Great Hall of the People. The painful past has been swept away, and what is unfolding before my eyes is a vast and prosperous road; every reed pipe is playing for the new life, and every string is vibrating for the new life.

A large grassland is close to the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and the clear river water overflows the river beach, jumping forward; four steeds gallop from the horizon, like four small boats sailing on the blue waves; three boys and one girl are riding on horseback, and the Tibetan robes are like fiery red feathers; the Tibetan people are infinitely happy and send outstanding children to report the new look of the plateau to the Party.

The mountains of Guangxi are beautiful and the flowing water is light, the Tung trees are like umbrellas and the Corypha elata stand tall, fluttering clouds; the Zhuang people's sincere hearts are redder than the blooming kapok flowers, and the revolutionary example comes from the heroic Red Army. The graceful Dombra calls to the flock, and the charming dance surrounds the mountain yurts; the Kazakh people are not only good at animal husbandry, but the cotton fields are covered with silver and the wheat waves are surging in the Gobi Desert.

The Altai Mountains overlook the vast wilderness, truly a vast sky with wind blowing and grass revealing cattle and sheep, but the yurts are no longer lonely, and there are noisy oil fields deep in the grasslands. Uighur singers, sing to your heart's content, sing of the scenery of the Tianshan Mountains enriching the southern Xinjiang silk, sing of the Turpan grapes climbing onto the train windows, sing of industry, sing of transportation, sing of the great harvest of rice.

There are no two mountains on the earth that are the same, and the clouds in the blue sky have their own postures, and thousands of rivers always have their own sources, and they join hands and rush to the sea together. Although each ethnic group has its own unique epic, the beautiful instruments play the same movement; each ethnic group uses its most beautiful language to warmly sing of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

The Communist Party is the common sun of all ethnic groups, bringing warmth and driving away the haze; the leadership of the Communist Party is the source of happiness, hand in hand towards the communist future.

    民族颂
    韩北屏一队队健美愉快的男女青年，紧扣臂膀齐步走过天安门前，他们身穿各民族美丽的衣裳，灿烂如云霞又如明月般皎洁。伟大的党和领袖检阅了他们，他们向党和领袖深情地仰望；阳光照射着锦簇茂盛的花丛，花丛承受着光辉热烈的阳光。我们祖国是多民族的大家庭，天安门前的盛况是一个缩影；党和领袖呵领导着各个民族，在祖国的原野上勇猛地前进。不论你走进哪个草原或乡村，虽然初次相逢并不显得陌生；不论地方多么遥远或者偏僻，接待你的一定是微笑的亲人。我踏过额尔齐斯河畔的茅草，看过五指山的山峰直插云霄，准噶尔盆地的喷泉辉映明月，红水河边芦笙吹奏欢乐曲调。古老淳朴的风习充满着诗意，崭新美妙的生活更令人惊喜；我要歌唱十年来发生的奇迹，但是忘不了那一连串的回忆。记得那是艰难的一九四四年，我翻过大苗岭穿过桂黔湘边，那里是侗傜苗族人民的家乡，十个寨子九个空荒凉少人烟；我迎着风雪脚踏山坡冻铃铛，爬过高峰峡谷来到一个村庄，忽然看见一堆破布慢慢走来，四围静寂这个景象使我惊慌；若不是破布堆中眼睛在闪亮，简直看不出她是苗族的姑娘，饥寒贫困使少女顾不得羞涩，向我们过路人索取多余衣裳；她说家里只有褴褛破被一床，遮住她的身体就遮不住爹娘；寒风摧折枯枝雪花飞舞山岗，我的心像我的身体一样冰凉。一个聪明少女不能没有理想，理想被扼杀挣扎在死亡线上；森林蔽天地下有无尽的宝藏，财富和人民的血汗喂了虎狼。和这个姑娘分别后没有重逢，我坚决相信她正在建设家乡，或者在民族学院里专心学习，或者侃侃发言在人民大会堂。悲痛的往事呵已经一扫而光，展现在眼前的呵是万里康庄；每一枝芦笛都为新生活吹奏，每一根琴弦都为新生活震响。一大片草原靠近黄河的上游，清清河水漫河滩跳跃往前走；四匹骏马从地平线上奔过来，就像碧波上飞驶着四只小舟；三个少年一个姑娘骑在马上，藏族的长袍如同火红的羽毛；藏民无限欢欣派出优秀儿女，去向党报告高原上的新风貌。广西的山峰挺秀而流水轻盈，桐树如伞桄榔矗立披拂行云，僮族赤诚的心红胜木棉花开，革命的榜样来自英雄红军。曼妙的冬布拉哟呼唤着羊群，迷人的舞姿哟环绕山间篷帐；哈萨克族不仅是畜牧的能手，棉田铺银戈壁上翻腾着麦浪。阿尔泰山俯瞰着茫茫的大野，真是天苍苍风吹草地见牛羊，但是蒙古包旁边不再寂寞了，草原的深处有喧闹着的油矿。维吾尔的歌手尽情地歌唱吧，唱天山景色丰富了南疆丝绸，唱吐鲁番葡萄攀上火车窗口，唱工业唱交通唱水稻大丰收。大地上没有两座同样的山峰，蓝天上的云彩各有各的姿态，千万条江河总有自己的源头，他们又携着手一起奔向大海。各民族虽有自己的独特史诗，美妙的乐器却奏出同一乐章；各民族用自己最美丽的语言，热烈地歌唱毛主席和共产党。共产党是各民族共同的太阳，他带来了温暖呵赶走了阴霾；共产党的领导是幸福的源头，携着手奔向共产主义的未来。
