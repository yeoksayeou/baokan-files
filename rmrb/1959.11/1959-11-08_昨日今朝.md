    Leap Across the Century
    By our reporters Yu Jingqi and Li Desen

    Swans are the most united birds in the sky,
    One spreads its wings, ten spread their wings,
    One flies east, ten fly east;
    The People's Commune is the swan of the human world,
    Many people, united hearts, great strength, guiding us towards a happy life.

    Liangshan, clear blue sky. Beside the Zhaojue River deep in the mountains, songs are floating. This is no longer the sad song of slaves, but the song of happiness sung by the members of the Nanping People's Commune!

    Walking along the river, we saw distant mountains like paintings, and a clear stream shimmering with sparkling waves. We followed commune leader Ahu Erre to visit the commune. A few years ago, he was still a slave under the slave system. Now he has become the leader of a people's commune with more than three thousand one hundred households. He would point to the weeds by the field, telling us that three years ago the rice was only one or two feet tall, and then point to the foot-long corn cobs, introducing that the corn at that time was only the size of a "chicken's head." He excitedly said: "Our progress in these three years has exceeded thousands of years, and now we are catching up with our Han brothers!"

    Three years ago, thirty-six households of slaves who had just been liberated from the slave owners' homes built the Nanping Advanced Agricultural Cooperative. Relying on the collective strength and the help of the state, they won the first year's bumper harvest with hard work. The following year, the Nanping Cooperative expanded to one hundred and forty-nine households. Last year, driven by the nationwide upsurge of communization and the urgent demands of the members, they united with the seventy-one agricultural cooperatives nearby to build the People's Commune. More than two thousand three hundred households among the members were slaves who had no freedom in the past.

    Commune leader Ahu told us that during the agricultural cooperative era, the face of agricultural production here had already undergone great changes, and it became even faster after the establishment of the People's Commune. In winter, the commune concentrated more than two thousand people to brave the wind and snow to go up the mountain to build water conservancy projects, and then launched a vigorous manure accumulation campaign and technical innovation movement. In the past, land cultivation here was less than three-tenths thorough, seeds were sown, white water seedlings were planted, randomly broadcast, and they waited for the harvest. This year, all cultivated land was deeply ploughed to a depth of seven inches to one foot, 20,000 jin of fertilizer was applied per mu, rice was rationally and densely planted at three by six or three by seven inches, the main crops were improved, and a regular field management movement was carried out. At the end of the reform, the only simple tools used by the members were plows, rakes, shovels, hoes, and Lianjia five kinds, but now they have more than twenty kinds of tools such as walking plows, wheeled plows, and threshing machines. On the land of the commune, crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and sugar beet and more than ninety kinds of vegetables such as spinach and green vegetables appeared for the first time. Because the slaughter of livestock for prayers disappeared, coupled with the improvement of feeding management, the commune's cattle and sheep were in groups, and every household's chicken and pig pens were full...

    Groups of three or five members were appearing and disappearing in the rice sea, everyone was radiant, and everyone was beaming. Beside a sea of rice of more than two thousand mu, old member Wo Maerlu smiled and said: "This year the grain harvest is four times more than three years ago, with an average of 700 jin. I have lived for fifty years, and I have never seen such a good crop!" He talked about what happened not long ago:

    In early July, Liangshan roared with rainstorms, and the crops in front of me were mostly submerged by the torrential river water overnight. In the era of slave owners, there was no way for people, and they had no heart to care. At that time, the slaves were doing "slow work" every day. But this time, after the members woke up from their sleep, they immediately ran to the river. Heavy rain and lightning roared overhead, and the roads were slippery and difficult to walk, but no one retreated, fell and immediately got up, stood in the waist-deep water to pass stones and wood, and built six long dikes in three days and nights to prevent the flood from rushing in again. The women took on the task of drainage, and showed the same spirit as the men, and used their hands to protect the harvest.

    On the hillside across the river, there is a sparse belt of villages. The members excitedly told us, "According to the former Yi clan division, that is the place of the Ashuo family. The Ashuo family and the Baqie family on the other side of the river have been enemies for many years, and many people have died in the armed fights," but now they are all members of the Nanping Commune. Guqu Duo team, which is composed of Ashuo family members, also has a production team with many Baqie family members. The two families of members work together and help each other closely. When dividing the cooperation area, because Guqu Brigade had more land and less fields, Nanping Brigade on the other side of the river took the initiative to give 40 mu of the best land to Guqu Brigade. During the spring plowing, Nanping Brigade heard that Guqu Brigade did not have enough seeds, and immediately transferred more than 10,000 jin of grain seeds to send over, so that Guqu Brigade could sow in time in the spring. When carrying out large-scale smoked soil manure accumulation, Guqu Brigade heard that Nanping Brigade lacked firewood and grass, and held a meeting overnight to send people up the mountain to cut more than 10,000 jin of firewood and grass to send across the river. They said: "Your difficulties are our difficulties, now we are one family!"

    Some of the main factories of the commune are concentrated together. In a row of houses, soil lathes are spinning rapidly, red light is radiating from the iron furnace, and the newly learned Yi ironworkers are busy rushing to make sickles for the autumn harvest and processing accessories for water pumps. Blue smoke is lingering above the brick and tile factory and the pottery factory, which looks like a small industrial area. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the members have been very happy to hear that they want to run industry. Some young people approached the cadres and asked to be workers, they said: "If we don't know how, we will learn. The Han brothers have factories long ago, and we also want to run them." In this way, under the guidance of Han cadres and workers, more than forty factories such as farm tool factories, fertilizer factories, and pesticide factories were built in a few months. In the past six months, they have built and repaired more than 10,000 farm tools, and the members have used sickles, hoes, and pesticides manufactured in their own factories for the first time.

    Facing the sunset, the members returned from the fields, and the "red scarves" returned from the school to the canteen one after another. Pink rice (red rice is produced here), snow-white tofu brain stewed green vegetables. Piles of families sitting together to eat are full of laughter. Member A Yunaniu used to be the lowest "Jiaxi" in the slave family of seven. He was beaten and scolded every day, and sold from one slave owner to another. He tried to escape to seek a better situation, but what he brought was more cruel persecution. The slave owner took his newborn baby from his arms and threw it into the big river, sold his wife to a distant place, locked him in the dungeon with fetters weighing more than 100 jin, beat him every day, and tortured him every night. But now, he has his own home, took off the rotten sheepskin and linen pants that he had not changed for many years, added several sets of new clothes, bought mosquito nets, quilts, daily necessities, and raised pigs and chickens. He often adds side dishes and buys pork when eating in the public canteen. He proudly said: "The slave owner's life is nothing compared to my life today!" When the People's Commune was established last year, he was the first to sign up to join the commune, and like many members, he said: "Wherever the Communist Party points, I will go."

    跨越世纪的飞跃
    本报记者　于竞祁　李德森
    天上飞禽最团结的是天鹅，
    一个展翅，十个展翅，
    一只向东，十只向东；
    人民公社是人间的天鹅，
    人多，心齐，力量大，指引我们走向幸福的生活。
    凉山，晴空万里。丛山深处的昭觉河畔，歌声飘扬。这再也不是奴隶的悲歌，而是南坪人民公社社员歌唱幸福之歌！
    沿河走去，只见远山如画，一湾清流闪烁着点点波光。我们随着公社社长阿胡尔惹去公社参观。几年前，他还是奴隶制度下的一个奴隶。如今他已成为一个拥有三千一百多户的人民公社的领导人了。他一会用手比着田边的野草，告诉我们三年前水稻只有一、二尺高，一会指着一尺多长的玉米包介绍那时的玉米只有“鸡脑壳”大。他兴奋地说：“这三年我们的进步超过几千年，现在正在向汉族老大哥看齐！”
    三年前，三十六户才从奴隶主家中解放出来的奴隶建成了南坪高级农业社。他们依靠集体的力量和国家的帮助，用辛勤的劳动夺得了第一年的大丰收。第二年，南坪社就扩大到一百四十九户。去年，在全国人民公社化的热潮推动和社员们的迫切要求下，他们和附近的七十一个农业社联合建成了人民公社。社员中有二千三百多户是过去毫无自由的奴隶。
    阿胡社长告诉我们，在农业社时代，这里的农业生产面貌就已有了很大的改变，建立人民公社后就更快了。冬天，社里集中了两千多人冒着风雪上山大修水利，接着又开展了轰轰烈烈的积肥运动和技术革新运动。从前，这里地耕不过三分，种籽下种，白水栽秧，乱播乱撒，坐等收成。今年，全部耕地深翻了七寸到一尺，每亩施肥两万斤，水稻采用三乘六、三乘七寸合理密植，主要作物良种化，开展了经常性的田间管理运动。改革结束时社员们使用的只有犁、耙、铲、锄和连耞五种简陋的工具，而现在已拥有步犁、带轮犁、打谷机各种工具二十多种。在公社的土地上，第一次出现了小麦、油菜、甜菜等作物和菠菜、青菜等九十多种蔬菜。由于屠杀牲畜祈禳的事绝迹，加上饲养管理的改善，社里牛羊成群，家家鸡猪满圈……
    三五成群的社员在稻海里忽隐忽现，人人精神焕发，个个红光满面。在一片两千多亩的稻海旁，老社员沃马尔陆笑着说：“今年谷子比三年前多收四倍，平均能打七百斤。我活了五十岁，从未见过这么好的庄稼！”他讲起不久前发生的事：
    7月初，凉山咆哮着暴风雨，眼前这庄稼一夜之间便大部被暴涨的河水淹没。要在奴隶主时代，人是没有办法的，也没有心肠去管。那时，奴隶们做工每天都“磨洋工”。但这次社员们从睡梦中惊醒后，马上就往河边跑。大雨和闪电在头上轰鸣，道路溜滑难行，没有一个人退缩，跌倒了马上爬起来，站在齐腰深的大水中传石递木，三天一夜筑成了六道长堤，阻止了洪水再冲入。妇女们担负起排水的任务，和男子们表现出同样的气概，用双手保住了丰收。
    河对面山坡上分布着一带稀疏的村落。社员们激动地告诉我们，“按照从前彝族家支划分，那是阿硕家的地方。阿硕家和河这边八且家是多年的冤家，在械斗中双方死过许多人”，但现在都是南坪公社社员了。阿硕家社员组成的古曲多队还有一个生产队有不少八且家的人。两家社员共同劳动，亲密互助。划分协作区时由于古曲大队地多田少，河这边的南坪大队主动把四十亩最好的田让给古曲大队。春耕时，南坪大队听说古曲大队种子不够，马上就调剂出一万多斤谷种送过去，使古曲大队及时春播。大搞熏土积肥时，古曲大队听说南坪大队缺柴缺草，连夜开会派人上山砍了一万多斤柴草送过河来。他们说：“你们的困难就是我们的困难，现在咱们是一家人！”
    公社的一些主要工厂都集中在一起。一连几排房子里，土车床飞快的旋转，打铁炉上红光四射，新学会技术的彝族铁工正忙碌地赶造秋收用的镰刀和为抽水机加工配件。砖瓦厂和陶器厂上空青烟缭绕，俨然一小工业区。从去年大跃进以来，社员们听说要办工业非常高兴。一些青年人找着干部要求当工人，他们说：“不会我们会学，汉族老大哥早就有了工厂，我们也要办。”就这样，在汉族干部和工人的指导下，几个月内就建起了农具厂、化肥厂、农药厂等四十多个工厂，半年来他们已打造和修补了一万多件农具，社员们第一次用上了自己厂里制造的镰刀、锄头和农药。
    迎着晚霞，社员们从田野、“红领巾”从学校纷纷回到食堂。粉红色的大米饭（这里出产红米），雪白的豆腐脑烩青菜。一堆堆围坐而食的家庭充满了欢声笑语。社员阿芸阿牛从前一家七口人都是奴隶中最下等的“呷西”，他没有一天不挨打，没有一天不挨骂，从一个奴隶主卖给另一个奴隶主。他企图用逃跑来求得较好的处境，但带来的是更残酷的迫害。奴隶主把他刚满月的婴儿从怀里夺去丢下大河，把他的妻子卖到远方，用一百多斤重的脚镣把他关在地牢里，天天吊打，夜夜折磨。而现在，他有了自己的家，脱下了多年未换过的烂羊皮和麻布裤，添置了几套新衣，买了蚊帐、被褥，日常用具，养了猪、鸡，在公共食堂吃饭时还经常添点小菜，买点猪肉。他自豪地说：“奴隶主的生活和我今天比，算得了什么！”当去年建立人民公社时，他首先报名入了社，和许多社员一样，他说：“共产党指引到哪里，我就去哪里。”
