Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, November 22nd: The seven countries (Britain, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, and Portugal) of the British-led "Little Free Trade Area," after two days of haggling at a ministerial meeting held in Stockholm, Sweden, provisionally signed the "European Free Trade Association" treaty on the 20th. This officially declared that Western European capitalist countries have split into two antagonistic economic blocs—the "European Free Trade Association" and the "Common Market."

The communiqué issued by the "Group of Seven" after the meeting stated that the treaty stipulates the elimination of tariffs and other trade barriers on industrial products among member states within ten years or less. The treaty also stipulates that each member state will have the right to freely determine its external tariffs.

The communiqué also stated that the Group of Seven is "determined to promote the early establishment of a multilateral alliance to eliminate trade barriers and promote closer economic cooperation among members of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation."

However, the emergence of the Group of Seven will obviously greatly intensify the trade war and contradictions between Western European countries. West German Chancellor Adenauer, after his visit to Britain, said in a speech that it is necessary to "prevent a trade war between the two groups," but he did not explain how to prevent such a "war."

Prior to the signing of the treaty, a series of talks held by the Group of Seven indicated that there are also numerous contradictions among the members of this group, especially between Britain and Norway, Denmark, and Sweden on trade issues such as agricultural products, aquatic products, and textiles.

The Finnish government sent representatives as "observers" to attend the Group of Seven meeting.

### 英国“小自由贸易区”正式建立  西欧两经济营垒矛盾加剧

    英国“小自由贸易区”正式建立
    西欧两经济营垒矛盾加剧
    新华社22日讯　斯德哥尔摩消息：以英国为首的“小自由贸易区”七国（英国、奥地利、瑞典、挪威、丹麦、瑞士和葡萄牙）在瑞典首都举行的部长级会议，经过了两天的讨价还价，已经在20日临时签署了“欧洲自由贸易联盟”条约，从而正式宣告西欧资本主义国家分裂成为两个敌对性的经济集团——“欧洲自由贸易联盟”和“共同市场”。
    “七国集团”在会议结束后发表的公报说，这个条约规定，联盟成员国之间在十年或更短一些的时间内，取消成员国工业品的关税及其他贸易壁垒。条约还规定，各成员国将有权自由决定它的对外关税。
    公报还说，七国集团“决心促使早日建立多边联盟以消除贸易壁垒和促进欧洲经济合作局成员国之间实现更密切的经济合作。”
    但是，七国集团的出现显然将大大加剧西欧国家之间的贸易战和矛盾。西德总理阿登纳在访问英国结束后发表谈话时曾经说，必须“阻止两个集团之间发生贸易战争”，但是他却没有说明如何能来阻止这种“战争”。
    在签订条约之前，七国举行的一系列会谈表明，这个集团各成员国之间也存在重重的矛盾，特别是英国和挪威、丹麦、瑞典三国之间在农产品、水产品和纺织品等贸易问题上存在着非常尖锐的矛盾。
    芬兰政府曾派代表以“观察员”身份列席七国会议。
