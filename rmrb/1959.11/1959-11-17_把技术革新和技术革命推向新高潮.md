Our machine industry has basically formed a system, completed the transition from repair and assembly to manufacturing, from imitation to independent design, and entered the world of advanced technology, providing the various sectors of the national economy with an increasing number of heavy, large, precision, and cutting-edge mechanical equipment, making the self-sufficiency rate of mechanical equipment reach about 80%. This is a tremendous achievement made by China's machine industry under the correct leadership of the Party.

However, we are never satisfied with the achievements we have already made. In order to build our nation into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in a not-too-long period of time, all sectors of the national economy are continuing to leap forward with overwhelming momentum. All departments and localities that use machines are carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, and have put forward new requirements for the machine industry; localities that have not yet used machines are even more eager for mechanization and semi-mechanization. All of these have further increased the tasks of the machine manufacturing sector. How to provide various departments with mechanical products of more varieties, greater quantities, higher efficiency, and better quality is the glorious responsibility of the vast number of workers on the machine industry front. To achieve this, there are still weak links in production and technology, and production capacity is still felt to be insufficient. Constantly resolving this contradiction means the continuous progress of the machine industry itself. In order to accomplish this arduous and glorious task, in order to continue to advance towards advanced technology and overcome weak links, it is necessary to push the technological innovation and technological revolution of the machine industry to a new stage. Carrying out basic construction to supplement new production capacity is undoubtedly not to be ignored, but from the perspective of the machine industry itself, constantly carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, so that one enterprise, one piece of equipment, and one ton of material can be used as two enterprises, two pieces of equipment, and two tons of material, is always the primary way for it to overcome weak links and improve production capacity and technological level. Because the achievements of technological innovation and technological revolution in the machine manufacturing sector will have a significant impact on the user departments, this is even more significant.

The technological innovation and technological revolution of the machine industry should combine relatively large goals with relatively small goals; combine long-term goals with short-term goals; both capture the strongholds of cutting-edge technology and break through the current weak links; both create versatile and advanced tools and equipment, and create specialized and simple tools and equipment; revolutionary advanced technology must be conquered, and small reforms in daily production should not be ignored; those who have the conditions to engage in automatic production lines should engage in automatic production lines, those who do not have the conditions to engage in automatic production lines should also improve the degree of mechanization, and as for places that are still using manual operations, semi-mechanization is their top priority. In short, according to the principle of walking on two legs, the combination of large and small, near and far, high and low should be combined, with solving current problems as the main focus.

What are the main contents of the technological innovation and technological revolution in the machine industry?

We believe that the first is the product design issue. This includes designing new products, reasonably simplifying the structure of products, reducing the weight and size of products, or improving the efficiency of products without increasing the weight or size of products, and so on; among them, special attention should be paid to the design of new products. This is because satisfying the needs in terms of variety of mechanical products is as important as satisfying the needs in terms of quantity; even if it is an existing variety, if it is replaced by a new variety, its use efficiency is often several times or even dozens of times different. The innovation and revolution of product design should unify the requirements of easy manufacturing, material saving, and ease of use; but easy manufacturing and material saving must be subordinate to the purpose of ease of use.

The second is to adopt new technological methods, reform technology and tools, refit equipment, promote mechanization and semi-mechanization, and so on. The potential in this area is endless. Take metal cutting as an example (which includes turning, milling, planing, drilling, etc.), if the production efficiency of each metal cutting machine tool is increased by 1% per month, it is equivalent to providing the country with the production capacity of tens of thousands of machine tools within a year without the state spending a penny of investment.

Another content is to adopt new materials and practice strict economy. The potential in this area is also enormous. If the materials consumed per unit of mechanical products in 1960 are reduced by another 5% to 10% compared with the actual consumption in 1959, the materials saved by the national machine industry will be calculated in units of 100,000 tons, and the effect is very amazing.

Finally, we believe that the standardization and serialization of mechanical products is also an important part of the technological innovation and technological revolution in the machine industry. This is a very important matter for both the manufacturing and user departments. For example, according to incomplete statistics, there are currently one hundred and several dozen specifications of crushing and grinding equipment used in mines, which are manufactured by more than one hundred mechanical enterprises, and it is inconvenient to master technology and organize production. If these products are serialized and parts and components are standardized, the manufacturing department can concentrate a part of the varieties or parts and components to organize large-scale assembly line production, which can further improve the technical level and labor productivity, use special equipment to save general-purpose equipment, and free up many enterprises that originally shared tasks to produce other varieties that the country urgently needs. From the perspective of the user department, it is also beneficial to improve technology and organize production, and the replenishment and replacement of parts and components will be much more convenient, and repairs will be easier. Other mechanical products have similar situations. Anything that can be standardized and serialized should be carried out.

The industries, products, and types of work in the machine industry are very complex, and the content of technological innovation and technological revolution is extremely rich. The above are just a few aspects, and each department, each region, and each enterprise must propose specific goals for a certain period of time according to its specific circumstances. For example, the Shanghai mechanical management department roughly divides the mechanical enterprises in the region into three categories and proposes three specific goals. The first category, enterprises that produce in large quantities in batches, focus on mechanization and automation; the second category, enterprises that undertake a relatively large number of heavy machinery manufacturing tasks, due to the lack of large-scale processing equipment, or insufficient even if they have them, the focus is on building simple and large-scale machine tools; the third category, the most numerous enterprises, focuses on the reform of technology. This approach is worth considering.

To make the technological innovation and technological revolution movement develop well, the fundamental guarantee is to continue to adhere to putting politics in command and vigorously launching mass movements. This has been irrefutably proved by the facts since the Great Leap Forward. Technological innovation and technological revolution are the regular and main content of mass movements in industrial enterprises in the future. Only with the participation of the broad masses of workers, and with them as the main force, forming a vigorous situation, will the flowers of technological innovation and technological revolution bloom more brilliantly.

The mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement must adhere to the principle of combining foreign and indigenous methods. Only talking about foreign methods without talking about indigenous methods, or without combining foreign and indigenous methods, will make it impossible to mobilize every worker; and the combination of foreign and indigenous methods is infinitely powerful. For example, the famous "ants gnawing bones," that is, the method of processing large parts with small machine tools, created by mechanical workers during the Great Leap Forward, is now not only being applied on a wider scale, but it itself has also undergone new developments. The "ants" in many factories have replaced the special power heads with general-purpose power heads, replaced manual feed with automatic feed, and replaced single-blade cutting with multi-blade and multi-edge cutting and whirlwind cutting; the processing precision has also been improved, and at the same time, it has developed from individual "ants" to "ant colonies." In this way, while using large machine tools to process large parts, the "ants gnawing bones" method has further played its role as one leg of processing large parts. Because it has the advantages of simple structure, easy manufacturing, light weight, and low cost, general mechanical enterprises can manufacture and refit it themselves. Even after there are more large machine tools, it will still continue to develop as the main method for small and medium-sized mechanical enterprises to process large parts and the auxiliary method for large mechanical enterprises to process large parts.

Since the Great Leap Forward, China's machine industry technological innovation and technological revolution has yielded fruitful results. Now, in the excellent situation of the continued leap forward across the country, with the great power of opposing right-leaning and inspiring hard work, and with the wide dissemination of advanced experience seeds after the National Conference of Heroes, we firmly believe that the mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement will bloom more brilliantly and bear more abundant fruits.

    把技术革新和技术革命推向新高潮
    本报评论员
    我国机械工业已经基本形成了体系，完成了从修配到制造、从仿造到自行设计的过渡，进入了世界先进技术的领域，向国民经济各部门日益增多地提供着重型、大型、精密和尖端的机械设备，使机械设备的自给率达到了80％左右。这是我国机械工业在党的正确领导下取得的巨大成就。
    但是，我们从来不以已有的成就为满足。为了在不太长的时间内把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家，国民经济各部门都在以排山倒海之势继续跃进。一切使用机器的部门和地方都在进行技术革新和技术革命，对机械工业都提出了新的要求；尚未使用机器的地方更是迫切地要求机械化和半机械化；所有这些，都更加加重了机械制造部门的任务。如何向各部门提供品种更多、数量更大、效率更高、质量更好的机械产品，是机械工业战线上广大职工的光荣职责。而要作到这一点，在生产上和技术上还有薄弱环节，生产能力还感到不足。不断地解决这个矛盾，便意味着机械工业本身的不断进步。为了完成这一艰巨而光荣的任务，为了继续向先进技术进军和克服薄弱环节，便必须把机械工业的技术革新和技术革命推向一个新的阶段。进行基本建设以补充新的生产能力这无疑是不可忽视的，但从机械工业本身来说，不断地进行技术革新和技术革命，使一个企业、一台设备、一吨材料顶两个企业、两台设备、两吨材料使用，始终是它克服薄弱环节、提高生产能力和技术水平的首要途径。由于机械制造部门的技术革新和技术革命的成果对使用部门将发生重大的影响，这就更加具有特殊的意义。
    机械工业的技术革新和技术革命，要把比较大的目标同比较小的目标结合起来；把长远的目标同近期的目标结合起来；既要夺取尖端技术堡垒，又要突破当前的薄弱环节；既要创造万能的和高级的工具设备，也要创造专门的和简易的工具设备；带革命性的先进技术一定要征服，日常生产中的细小改革也不可忽视；有条件搞自动生产线的应当搞自动生产线，没有条件搞自动生产线的也应当提高机械化的程度，至于还在用手工操作的地方，半机械化则是它们的当务之急。总之，应当根据两条腿走路的方针，把大小、远近、高低等方面结合起来，而以解决当前的问题为主。
    什么是机械工业技术革新和技术革命的主要内容呢？
    我们认为，首先是产品设计问题。这包括设计新的产品，合理地简化产品的结构，减轻产品的重量和缩小产品的体积，或者不加重产品的重量和不加大产品的体积而又提高产品的效率，等等；其中要特别抓紧新产品的设计。这是因为，机械产品在品种上满足需要同在数量上满足需要，一样具有重大的意义；即令是已有的品种，如果代之以新的品种，其使用效率往往有数倍以至数十倍之差。对产品设计的革新和革命，要把便于制造、节约材料、利于使用这三方面的要求统一起来；但是便于制造和节约材料又必须服从利于使用这个目的。
    其次是采用新的工艺方法，改革工艺和工具，改装设备，推行机械化和半机械化，等等。这方面的潜力是没有穷尽的。就拿金属切削来说吧（这里面又包括车、铣、刨、钻等等），如果每台金属切削机床的生产效率一个月提高1％，就等于在一年之内不要国家花一块钱的投资，而向国家提供成万台机床的生产能力。
    再一个内容就是采用新材料和厉行节约。这方面的潜力也是极大的。如果1960年单位机械产品所消耗的材料比1959年的实际消耗再节约5％到10％，全国机械工业所节约的材料就要用十万吨作单位计算，效果是十分惊人的。
    最后，我们认为机械产品的标准化和系列化，也是机械工业技术革新和技术革命的一个重要内容。这对制造部门和使用部门都是非常重要的事情。例如，矿山上用的破碎球磨设备，据不完全的统计，目前有一百几十种规格分散在一百多个机械企业制造，在掌握技术和组织生产等方面都感到不便。如果把这些产品加以系列化，零件和部件加以标准化，制造部门就可以把一部分品种或者零件和部件集中起来组织大量流水生产，就可以进一步提高技术水平和劳动生产率，使用专用设备以节省万能设备，使原来分担任务的许多企业腾出手来去生产国家急需的其他品种。从使用部门说，也有利于提高技术和组织生产，零件和部件的补充和更换就方便得多，修理也比较容易。其他的机械产品也有类似的情况。凡是可以进行标准化和系列化的，就应当进行这个工作。
    机械工业的行业、产品和工种都非常复杂，技术革新和技术革命的内容无比丰富，上面说的不过是几个方面，每个部门、每个地区、每个企业都要根据自己的具体情况提出一定时期的具体目标。例如上海机械管理部门，把本地区的机械企业大致分成三类，提出三种具体目标。第一类，成批大量生产的企业，重点是搞机械化和自动化；第二类，担负重型机械制造任务比较重的企业，由于没有大型加工的设备，或者虽有而不足，重点便是大搞简易大型机床；第三类，为数最多的企业，则以工艺的改革为中心。这种作法，值得参考。
    要使技术革新和技术革命运动开展得好，根本的保证是继续坚持政治挂帅和大搞群众运动。这是大跃进以来的事实所不容置辩地证明了的。技术革新和技术革命是今后工业企业中群众运动的经常主要内容。只有在广大职工群众的参加下，并以他们为主力，形成轰轰烈烈的局面，技术革新和技术革命的花朵才会越开越灿烂。
    群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动必须坚持贯彻洋土并举的方针。只讲洋不讲土，不讲洋土并举，便不可能把每个职工都发动起来；而洋土一结合，威力便无穷。例如，在大跃进中机械工人创造的著名的“蚂蚁啃骨头”亦即小机床加工大部件的方法，现在不但应用的范围扩大了，而且它本身又有了新的发展。不少工厂的“蚂蚁”已经用通用动力头代替了专用动力头，用自动进刀代替了人工进刀，用多刀多刃切削和旋风切削代替了单刀切削；加工的精密度也提高了，同时从单个“蚂蚁”发展为“蚂蚁群”。这样，在使用大型机床加工大部件的同时，“蚂蚁啃骨头”的方法也进一步发挥了它作为加工大部件的一条腿的作用。由于它具有结构简、制造易、重量轻、成本低这些优点，一般机械企业都可以自己制造和改装，即令在有了更多的大型机床以后，它仍将作为中小型机械企业加工大部件的主要方法和大型机械企业加工大部件的辅助方法而继续发展下去。
    大跃进以来，我国机械工业技术革新和技术革命结出了累累的果实。现在在全国继续跃进的大好形势中，有了反右倾鼓干劲这一伟大的动力，又有全国群英会召开后先进经验种子的广为传播，我们深信，群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动定会开出更灿烂的花朵，结出更丰硕的果实。
