Xinhua News Agency, Berlin - The State Central Bureau of Statistics of the German Democratic Republic has released a communique regarding the implementation of the economic plan for the first three quarters of 1959.

The communique stated that compared to the same period in 1958, the total industrial output value increased by 5.8 billion marks, an increase of 13.6%; the output value of the construction industry increased by 25%; the volume of foreign trade with both Western and Eastern Germany increased by 17%; and the domestic retail sales volume increased by 11%.

The communique said that the rapid progress of industrial production in the German Democratic Republic was mainly due to the improved supply of raw materials and materials to factories and enterprises, and the continuous increase in the number of people participating in socialist competitions and striving to become activists and innovators. In September of this year, more than 30,000 work teams (with 355,000 members) participated in the campaign to win the title of "Socialist Labor Team." Currently, there are more than 18,000 socialist labor and research collectives with approximately 154,000 members.

The communique pointed out that industrial production in the first three quarters exceeded the original plan by 1.4%. Compared with the same period last year, the labor productivity of socialist industrial enterprises increased by 10.7%.

Compared with the same period last year, electricity production increased by 6.9%, metallurgical and mining industrial production increased by 11.9%, chemical industry production increased by 10.4%, and machine manufacturing industry production increased by more than 20%.

The communique stated that the state invested a total of 9.6 billion marks in the first three quarters. Investment in the chemical industry increased by 43% compared to the same period last year.

When discussing agricultural achievements, the communique stated that from September 3rd of last year to September 3rd of this year, the number of livestock increased to approximately 4.5 million head, an increase of 10.6%.

The communique stated that agricultural production cooperatives own 2.7 million hectares of cultivated land, accounting for 41.9% of the country's total arable land.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 8th - Construction has recently commenced on one of the largest projects in the German Democratic Republic's Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965) – the Werchow Power Station.

The Werchow Power Station will have twelve turbines, each with a power generation capacity of 100,000 kilowatts. Once completed, its power generation capacity will reach 1.2 million kilowatts, enough to supply 45 cities the size of Halle, or 16 cities the size of the major industrial center of Dresden. The power station will be fully completed in 1966, and its power generation capacity will reach 1 million kilowatts by 1965.

After completion, the Werchow Power Station will play a significant role in the German Democratic Republic's electricity production. Along with the Lübbenau Power Station (with a power generation capacity of 1.3 million kilowatts), which began construction in 1957, it will become one of the German Democratic Republic's electric power industry's crown jewels. The power generation capacity of these two projects after completion will be greater than the current power generation capacity of all power stations in the German Democratic Republic (2.3 million kilowatts). The electricity generated by these two giant power stations can meet the needs of 120 cities with a population of 60,000, equivalent to the total electricity production of the Netherlands.

The fuel for the Werchow Power Station will be supplied by the "Youth" coal mine located nearby. This coal mine will supply the power station with 44,000 tons of bituminous coal per day.

The construction of the Werchow Power Station will fundamentally change the face of the small town of Werchow and its surrounding areas. Construction has already begun in Werchow on a residential area with 500 homes, including a cinema, cultural palace, park, nursery, and shops. In the future, 1,100 homes will be built for the power station workers.

    德头三季工业生产计划超额完成
    规模宏伟的韦乔发电站建筑工程开工
    新华社柏林电　德意志民主共和国国家中央统计局发表了关于1959年头三季经济计划执行情况的公报。
    公报说，和1958年同期相比，今年头三个季度工业总产值增加五十八亿马克，即增加13.6％，建筑工业的产值增加25％，对外和东西德贸易额增加17％，国内零售商品额增加11％。
    公报说，德意志民主共和国工业生产大踏步前进之所以成为可能，主要是由于工厂企业的原料和材料的供应情况有了改善，参加社会主义竞赛以及争取成为积极分子和革新者运动的人数在不断增加。在今年9月，有三万多个工作队（拥有三十五万五千名队员）参加争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的运动。现在，已经有一万八千多个社会主义劳动和研究集体，它们的成员大约有十五万四千人。
    公报指出，今年头三个季度的工业生产超额1.4％完成原订计划。同去年同期相比，社会主义工业企业的劳动生产率提高10.7％。
    和去年同期相比，今年头三个季度的电力产量增加6.9％，冶金和采矿工业生产增加11.9％，化学工业增加10.4％，机器制造工业增加20％以上。
    公报说，在头三个季度中，国家一共投资九十六亿马克。化学工业的投资比去年同期增加43％。
    公报在谈到农业方面的成就时说，从去年9月3日到今年9月3日，家畜的头数增加到大约四百五十万头，即增加10.6％。
    公报说，农业生产合作社所拥有的耕地达二百七十万公顷，占全国可耕地总面积的41.9％。
    新华社柏林8日电　德意志民主共和国发展国民经济七年计划（1959—1965）的最大工程之一——韦乔发电站的建设工程已于最近开工。
    韦乔发电站拥有十二台发电能力各为十万瓩的涡轮机，它建成后的发电能力将达一百二十万瓩，足以供应四十五个像哈雷这样大的城市，或十六个像大工业中心德累斯顿那样的城市之用。发电站将于1966年全部建成，到1965年，它的发电能力将达到一百万瓩。
    韦乔发电站建成后，对德意志民主共和国的电力生产将起巨大作用。它和从1957年起就开始兴建的卢贝瑙发电站（发电能力为一百三十万瓩），将成为德意志民主共和国电力工业的两颗明珠。这两项工程完成后的发电能力比现在德意志民主共和国全国所有发电站的发电能力（二百三十万瓩）还要大，这两座巨型电站所发出的电力可满足一百二十个拥有六万人口的城市的需要，相当于荷兰全国的发电量。
    韦乔发电站的燃料将由在它附近的“青年”煤矿来供应。这个煤矿每日将供应电站四万四千吨烟煤。
    韦乔发电站的建设，将使韦乔这个小镇和附近地区的面貌发生根本变化。现在，已经开始在韦乔修建一个有五百所住宅的住宅区，其中包括电影院、文化宫、公园、托儿所和商店。将来还要为发电站工人修建一千一百所住宅。
