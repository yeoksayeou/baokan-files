    Peking University History Department
    Discusses Issues in Minority Nationalities History
    In late October, the History Department of Peking University held a discussion meeting on issues in the history of minority nationalities. Attending the discussion were teachers, graduate students, minority nationality students, and some Han students from the History Department, as well as some teachers from the Philosophy and Law Departments. The meeting focused on the issues raised in the three papers by Professor Jian Bozan, teacher Wei Qiwen, and student Liang Yingming. Among these, the debate was most heated on the question of national assimilation and national integration.

    Regarding the Issue of National Integration
    Jian Bozan believes that "in the historical period of class society, there is generally only national assimilation. Assimilation is basically compulsory, that is, the advanced, highly productive nation forces the backward, less productive nation to assimilate to itself; or the large, strong nation forces the small, weak nation to assimilate to itself." He also believes that although assimilation is compulsory, it still has progressive significance. Integration, on the other hand, "is the highly unified state of all nationalities on the basis of international communism, that is, forming a new nationality that is neither the A nationality nor the B nationality, but a completely new nationality; this will only be possible after socialism has triumphed on a global scale for a long period of time."

    Some comrades agreed with Jian Bozan's view. Many comrades believed that in class society, as a result of the long-term cohabitation, friendly exchanges, and intermarriage of people of all nationalities, "natural integration' and the ruling class's 'forced assimilation' exist simultaneously." Some comrades analyzed the main characteristics of the languages of the Yugur, Tujia, and Dongxiang nationalities to illustrate that these nationalities were formed by the long-term integration of parts of several different nationalities.

    Regarding the Role of Assimilation Policies
    There was also debate at the meeting about "the role of assimilation policies." For example, Lin Naishen believes that "'natural integration' is an objective law of the historical development of ethnic relations in multi-ethnic countries, and this law is determined by the laws of social development and class struggle." And "the so-called 'forced assimilation' policy does not actually work, so there can be no real 'forced assimilation' in history." He also said: "The appeasement policy is just the ruling class unconsciously or forced to comply with the law of 'natural integration', so it mostly worked. Sometimes the 'forced assimilation' policy seems to work, but that is not due to the compulsory policy itself, but because this policy coincides with the objective law of natural integration." Many comrades disagreed with this view. They believed that as a policy of the ruling class, the policy of forced assimilation does play a role. Xu Daling said: "The policy of forced assimilation has two effects: if it conforms to the law of historical development, it plays a progressive role; if it violates the requirements of historical development, it plays a reactionary role."

    Regarding the Issue of National Heroes
    There were also differences in everyone's understanding of the question of "what is a national hero." Jian Bozan disagreed with the saying that "a true national hero represents the interests of the broad masses of his own nation without harming the interests of other nationalities." He believes that "there are no such national heroes in the history of class society." He said, "In the historical conditions of class society, national heroes are limited by class and era, and they cannot be without narrow-minded racism or nationalism, which hinders them from taking care of the interests of other nationalities." He cited Yue Fei as an example, saying: "Yue Fei is a national hero, but his racist ideas are strong. In 'Man Jiang Hong,' he wrote: 'I will eat the flesh of the Hu captives when hungry, and laugh and drink the blood of the Xiongnu when thirsty.' If we require such a person full of racist ideas to distinguish between the Jurchen rulers and the Jurchen people, and to repel the invasion of the Jurchen rulers without harming the interests of the Jurchen people, that is impossible."

    Comrades who disagreed with this view believed that Jian Bozan overemphasized the subjective consciousness of national heroes. They said, "Only those who defend the interests of their own nation and resist invaders are national heroes"; "The 'Hu captives' and 'Xiongnu' in 'Man Jiang Hong' are just synonymous with invaders, and do not generally refer to the Jurchen working people. Therefore, it cannot be said that Yue Fei has racist sentiments." and believed that "Yue Fei's resistance to the Jin soldiers' invasion did not harm the interests of the Jurchen people."

    The vast majority of teachers and students who participated in this discussion meeting had participated in the one-year national survey of the social history of minority nationalities and the compilation of the brief histories, chronicles, and outlines of local autonomy of various nationalities. After these practical exercises, their teaching and scientific research levels have been greatly improved.

### 北京大学历史系  讨论少数民族历史问题

    北京大学历史系
    讨论少数民族历史问题
    10月下旬北京大学历史系举办了一次少数民族历史问题讨论会。出席讨论会的有历史系的教师、研究生、少数民族学生和部分汉族学生，还有哲学系和法律系的部分教师。会上就翦伯赞教授、魏启文教师和梁英明同学的三篇论文所提出的问题展开了讨论。其中关于民族同化与民族融合的问题，争论最为热烈。
    关于民族融合问题
    翦伯赞认为，“在阶级社会的历史时期，一般只有民族同化。同化基本上是带有强制性的，即先进的、生产力高的民族，使得落后的、生产力低的民族不得不同化于自己；或者大的、生活力强的民族，迫使小的、生活力弱的民族同化于自己。”他还认为，同化虽带有强制性，但仍然具有进步的意义。融合则“是各民族在国际共产主义的基础之上的高度统一，即形成既非甲民族，又非乙民族，而是一个从来没有的新民族；这要在社会主义在世界范围内取得胜利以后的很长时期内才有实现的可能”。
    有些同志同意翦伯赞的看法。有许多同志则认为，在阶级社会中，由于各族人民长期杂居、友好往来和互通婚姻的结果，“自然融合”和统治阶级的“强制同化是同时存在的”。有些同志从对裕固、土家和东乡等族言语的主要特征进行分析，来说明这几个民族就是各自由几个不同的民族的部分人民，长期融合而成的。
    关于同化政策的作用问题
    关于“同化政策的作用”，会上也有争论。如林乃燊认为“‘自然融合’是多民族国家民族关系发展历史的客观规律，这条规律是受社会发展规律和阶级斗争规律所决定的。”而“所谓‘强制同化’政策在实际上并不起作用，所以在历史上不可能有真正的‘强制同化’”。他并说：“安抚政策不过是过去统治阶级不自觉地或被迫地顺应‘自然融合’这一规律，所以大都起了作用。有时‘强制同化’政策好像也起作用，但是那不是由于强制政策本身，而是由于这个政策和自然融合这一客观规律巧合”。许多同志不同意这一看法。他们认为，作为统治阶级的政策来说，强制同化的政策是起作用的。许大龄说：“强制同化政策有两种作用，即符合了历史发展的规律，就起进步作用；违背了历史发展的要求，就起反动作用”。
    关于民族英雄问题
    大家对于“什么是民族英雄”这一问题的认识也有分歧。翦伯赞不同意这样一种说法，即“真正的民族英雄既代表本民族广大人民的利益，而又不损害其他民族人民的利益”。他认为“这样的民族英雄在阶级社会的历史中是没有的”。他说，“在阶级社会的历史条件下，民族英雄要受到阶级性和时代性的限制，他们不可能没有偏狭的种族主义或民族主义的思想，这样就阻碍了他们照顾其他民族人民的利益”。他举岳飞为例说：“岳飞是一个民族英雄，但他的种族主义思想是浓厚的，他在‘满江红’中写道：‘壮志饥餐胡虏肉，笑谈渴饮匈奴血’。像这样一个充满了种族主义思想的人，如果要求他区分女真统治者和女真人民，既要打退女真统治者的侵略，又要不损害女真人民的利益，那是不可能的。”
    不同意这一说法的同志认为，翦伯赞过分强调了民族英雄的主观意识。他们说，“只有保卫本民族利益，反抗侵略者的人，才是民族英雄”；“满江红中的‘胡虏’、‘匈奴’只是侵略者的代名词，并不泛指女真劳动人民，因此，不能据此而说岳飞有种族主义情绪。”并认为，“岳飞反抗金兵侵略，并不曾损害女真人民的利益。”
    参加这次讨论会的师生绝大多数是参加过为时一年的全国少数民族社会历史调查工作，和各民族简史、简志与地方自治概况的编写工作。他们经过了这些实际锻炼，在教学和科学研究水平方面大大地得到了提高。
