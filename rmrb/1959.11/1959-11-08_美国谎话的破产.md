    The Bankruptcy of American Lies
    Xinhua News Agency Commentary
    On the Laotian situation, the lie of the so-called "aggression of Laos" by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which the United States, in collusion with the Sananikone government, has been spreading, has once again been completely bankrupted in the face of facts. The so-called United Nations Security Council "Committee of Inquiry on Laos," illegally established under the manipulation of the United States, issued a "report" on November 6. The United States, in violation of the provisions of the United Nations Charter, forcibly established this illegal body with the purpose of fabricating so-called "evidence" of "aggression" by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. However, this "Committee of Inquiry" spent nearly a month in Laos, and then returned to New York to "draft a report" under the direct influence of the United States, before publishing this "report" more than twenty days after leaving Laos. Despite all the painstaking efforts of the United States, the "Committee of Inquiry" did not come up with any evidence of this so-called "aggression". The "report" admits that "from all the information provided to the Committee of Inquiry, it cannot be clearly confirmed that regular troops of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam crossed the border."
    It is worth recalling that in recent months, the U.S. State Department has issued a series of statements about "North Vietnamese infiltration into Laos", the U.S. representative at the United Nations declared that "there is no doubt that aggression is taking place," and the Laotian government even guaranteed that it had "the most conclusive evidence" of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's army "invading" Laos. But all this only shows how shamelessly they can tell such a big lie.
    The Sananikone government established a special agency to fabricate "evidence". It offered huge rewards everywhere to capture "Viet Minh prisoners", but of course, not a single one was caught. In addition to instructing government officials to submit false reports, it also sent troops, using a scorched-earth policy to threaten good residents, to arrest people and force them to "testify". The so-called "testimonies" mixed in the "report" submitted by the United Nations "Committee of Inquiry" under the arrangement of the United States, which slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, were just such stuff. The entire Laotian "investigation" farce directed by the United States has become an international laughing stock, and it once again proves that U.S. imperialism is only using this trick to cover up its own interference in Laos and its behavior of creating tensions in the Indochina region.
    However, it seems that the United States is not reconciled, and is still continuing to conspire to aggravate the tense situation in Laos, and is trying to further use the United Nations as a tool to intensify its interference in Laos. While admitting that there is no evidence of "aggression" by the army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the illegal United Nations "Committee of Inquiry" insisted that there were all kinds of false "testimonies" of Laotian "hostile elements receiving assistance from North Vietnam." This shows that the United States insists on laying the groundwork to continue lying as an excuse for its continued interference in Laos. As expected, after the "report" was published, the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Mission to the United Nations immediately issued statements, advocating that the United Nations should take "further measures" on the Laotian issue, and that the United Nations should have personnel stationed in Laos. As one of such measures, the United Nations announced on the 6th that United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjold was considering "visiting" Laos. Prime Minister Sananikone, who had just returned to Laos from Washington, revealed as early as the 3rd that Hammarskjold, who would be going to Laos, received the mission from Washington to arrange for the United Nations to "send representatives to reside in Laos for a long time," and to "personally further understand the foreign aggression against Laos as accused by the Laotian government."
    The new conspiracy that the United States is actively implementing is to establish a permanent institution of one form or another in Laos, so that the activities of the United States to expand the war in Laos and aggravate the tense situation there can be carried out under the banner and cover of the United Nations, and other countries can be dragged into the water through the United Nations when necessary.
    During the recent illegal "investigation" of Laos by the United Nations under the manipulation of the United States, the situation in Laos has further deteriorated. A large number of U.S. military personnel and weapons are flowing into Laos, the U.S. plan to expand the training of the Laotian government army is being implemented, and the United States is increasing the capital for the Laotian authorities to fight a civil war. At the same time, in order to further suppress the patriotic and democratic forces in Laos and block the way for a peaceful solution to the Laotian issue, Sananikone announced again on the 3rd that the "trial" of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front would be held "as soon as possible". The United States is instigating the Laotian authorities to do their best to prolong and expand the civil war. Laos is becoming a military base for the United States to carry out aggression and expansion in Indochina, and the peace and security of this region is facing an increasingly serious threat.
    Obviously, if the United Nations is allowed to continue to interfere in Laos under the command of the United States, it will only aggravate the tense situation in Laos. The Laotian issue must be resolved peacefully in accordance with the Geneva Agreement and the Vientiane Agreement, and the United Nations has no right to interfere at all. The statement issued by the Soviet delegation to the United Nations on the 6th pointed out the practical and feasible correct way to ease the tension in Laos, that is, to immediately restore the work of the International Supervisory and Control Commission, and if the International Commission cannot resume its work soon, the participating countries of the Geneva Conference should hold a meeting without delay to discuss the current situation in Laos.
    The United States has recently been clamoring on the Laotian situation about the so-called "communist countries threatening" Asian countries. Now, everyone can clearly see that this is a smokescreen of "a thief crying 'stop thief'". All peace-loving people can see from the Laotian situation that the real threat to Asian countries comes from the United States, and the interference and aggression of U.S. imperialism must be stopped.

    美国谎话的破产
    新华社记者述评
    在老挝局势上，美国勾结萨纳尼空政府大肆散布的所谓越南民主共和国“侵略老挝”的谎言，再一次在事实面前彻底破产了。在美国操纵下，非法成立的所谓联合国安全理事会“调查老挝局势小组委员会”，11月6日发表了“报告”。美国违背联合国宪章的规定，强行成立这个非法机构，目的就为了要捏造出所谓越南民主共和国“侵略”的“证据”。然而，这个“小组委员会”在老挝活动近一个月，又回纽约在美国直接影响下“草拟报告”，在离开老挝二十多天后才发表出这个“报告”。尽管美国如此煞费心机地进行种种努力，“小组委员会”并提不出这种所谓“侵略”的任何证据，“报告”里承认，“从向小组委员会提供的全部情报看来，不能明确证实有越南民主共和国的正规军越过边界的情事”。
    值得回忆的是，近几个月来，美国国务院曾经接连不断地发表所谓“北越渗入老挝”的声明，美国代表曾经在联合国宣称“毫无疑问侵略正在进行”，老挝政府更曾经担保它有着越南民主共和国军队“侵入”老挝的“最确凿的证据”。但是，所有这些都只是说明，他们能够多么恬不知耻地撒下弥天大谎。
    萨纳尼空政府曾经成立了捏造“证据”的专门机构。它到处悬赏巨款来抓“越盟俘虏”，结果当然一个也抓不到。它除了指使政府官员提出假报告外，还出动军队，用杀光、烧光政策来威胁善良居民，来抓人逼人去“作证”。在美国布置下联合国“小组委员会”提出的“报告”里，还夹杂着对越南民主共和国进行诬蔑的许多所谓“证词”，便是这样的货色。美国导演下的整个老挝“调查”丑剧，已经成为国际上的笑谈，它再一次证明，美帝国主义只是用这个把戏来掩饰它自己干涉老挝、一手在印度支那地区制造紧张局势的行为。
    但是，看来美国并不甘心，还在继续阴谋加剧老挝紧张局势，并且设法进一步利用联合国作为它加紧干涉老挝的工具。非法的联合国“小组委员会”“报告”在承认没有越南民主共和国军队“侵略”证据的同时，又硬说有什么老挝“敌对分子得到来自北越境内的援助”的形形色色的假“证词”。这说明美国坚持要埋下伏笔，继续说谎，作为它继续干涉老挝的借口。果然，“报告”发表后，美国国务院和美国驻联合国代表团马上分别发表声明，鼓吹联合国要就老挝问题采取“进一步措施”，联合国要有人驻在老挝。作为这样的措施之一，联合国6日宣布，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德正在考虑“访问”老挝。刚从华盛顿返回老挝的首相萨纳尼空早在3日透露，将去老挝的哈马舍尔德从华盛顿领到的使命是安排联合国“派代表长住老挝”，并且要“亲自进一步了解老挝政府所控告的外国侵略老挝的情况”。
    美国正在积极执行的新阴谋就是，在老挝设立这种或那种形式的常驻机构，以便美国扩大老挝战火、加剧那里紧张局势的活动能在联合国的招牌和掩护下进行，并且在需要时可以通过联合国来拖其他国家下水。
    在最近美国操纵联合国对老挝非法“调查”期间，老挝局势已经进一步恶化。美国大批军事人员和武器源源进入老挝，美国扩大训练老挝政府军队的计划在执行，美国在增加着老挝当局打内战的资本。同时，为了进一步镇压老挝爱国民主力量，堵塞老挝问题和平解决的途径，萨纳尼空3日又宣布，要“尽快”举行对苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的“审判”。美国在唆使老挝当局竭力延长和扩大内战。老挝正变成美国在印度支那进行侵略扩张的军事基地，这个地区的和平和安全正受到越来越严重的威胁。
    很显然，如果允许联合国在美国指挥下继续对老挝进行干涉，只会加剧老挝的紧张局势。老挝问题必须根据日内瓦协议和万象协议和平解决，联合国根本无权过问。苏联出席联合国代表团6日发表的声明，指出了和缓老挝紧张局势的切实可行的正确途径，那就是马上恢复国际监察和监督委员会的工作，如果国际委员会不能很快恢复工作，日内瓦会议参加国应该刻不容缓地开会来讨论老挝当前的局势。
    美国最近一直在老挝局势问题上大叫大嚷所谓“共产党国家威胁”亚洲国家。现在，谁都可以清楚地看到，这是一种“贼喊捉贼”的烟幕。一切爱好和平人民从老挝局势中都可以看到，对亚洲国家真正威胁来自美国，必须制止美帝国主义的干涉和侵略。
