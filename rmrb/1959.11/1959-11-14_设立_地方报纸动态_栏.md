    Establishment of "Local Newspaper Trends" Column
    Some readers have written to say that local newspapers contain a lot of good content, but readers, due to time and other limitations, cannot regularly read newspapers from all over the country. They hope that the People's Daily will pay attention to reprinting and introducing good content from local newspapers.
    After studying this, our newspaper believes this suggestion is very good. In the future, in addition to paying attention to reprinting important reports and articles from local newspapers, we will also establish a "Local Newspaper Trends" column to regularly report on the propaganda trends and experiences of local newspapers. --Editor

    设立“地方报纸动态”栏
    有些读者来信说，各地报纸上好东西很多，而读者由于时间等方面的限制，不可能经常阅读全国各地的报纸。希望人民日报注意转载和介绍地方报纸上的好东西。
    本报研究后，认为这个意见很好。今后除注意转载各地报纸重要的报道和文章外，并设立“地方报纸动态”专栏，经常报道各地报纸的宣传动态和经验。——编　者
