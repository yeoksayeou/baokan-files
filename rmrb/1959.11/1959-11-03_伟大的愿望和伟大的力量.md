Great Aspirations and Great Strength
Wu Lü

Why is it that when the night is so late, and mother, younger brother, and younger sister are all asleep, Sun Guizhen, a weaving worker from the Tianjin No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill, quietly gets up and uses her room as a workshop to explore new patrol routes needed for high-speed, high-yield production? Why does Wei Gaohou, a milling worker from the Chongqing Chang’an Machinery Factory, have such abundant innovative spirit, enabling him to realize 472 technical innovation proposals and overcome 67 key production problems in the 200-plus days from January to September of this year? Why is Su Guangming, the well-known pace-setter from the Harbin Vehicle Factory, always speeding ahead and already working on tasks scheduled for 1970? Why? The heroes at the Conference of Heroes have a unanimous answer: to wipe away the traces of poverty and backwardness that history has left on our land and to build our country into a great socialist nation with modern industry, modern agriculture, and a modern science and culture in a not-too-long period of time.

The people do not rely on God or immortals to realize their aspirations; their wisdom and hands are the great strength. Difficulties? Yes, there are. How can there not be difficulties in making the two old-fashioned medium-sized blast furnaces, built more than 40 years ago at the Benxi Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, which were dubbed "old geezers," achieve high production and high quality? However, the workers of the Benxi Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant were not intimidated by the difficulties. They humbly learned from other's advanced experience and boldly innovated technology, finally creating the highest utilization coefficient record for large and medium-sized blast furnaces in the country and have maintained the leading position in utilization coefficient among large and medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide for 18 consecutive months. As Shanghai workers say, "Difficulties are like springs; they yield to the strong and prevail over the weak. " Since the people can defeat the old world, they will surely be able to build a happy socialist mansion on the ruins of the old world.

The people's strong desire to build socialism is the most beautiful desire of mankind; the people's strength is the greatest strength in the world. The right-leaning opportunists poured cold water on this most beautiful desire of mankind and this greatest strength in the world, slandering it as "petty-bourgeois fanaticism," saying that this was "too fast," that was "too early," that this was "botched up," and that was "not worth the loss," always trying to obstruct the development of the mass movement for socialist construction. Isn't this a crime?

Who is it that has such a cold expression in the face of the people's strong desire to build socialism? Who is it that has so much dissatisfaction and censure in the face of the people's strength? Only the bourgeoisie. The people's desire to build socialism runs counter to the interests of the bourgeoisie, and the people's strength is the torrent that will forever bury the capitalist system. The right-leaning opportunists in our ranks sing the same old tunes as the bourgeoisie, which shows that what they reflect is not, as they say, "Marxist viewpoints," but thorough bourgeois viewpoints, and what they represent is not the interests of the people, but the interests of the bourgeoisie.

Building socialism at high speed is the most fundamental interest and the most ardent desire of the people. The common language of the more than 6,000 representatives at the Conference of Heroes is: forever oppose right-leaning tendencies, forever maintain high speed!

    伟大的愿望和伟大的力量
    吴滤
    为什么夜这样深了，妈妈、弟弟和妹妹都睡了，天津国棉二厂的织布工孙桂珍却悄悄地爬起来，把房间当作车间，探求高速高产所需要的新的巡回路线？为什么重庆长安机器厂的铣工魏高厚竟有这样充沛的首创精神，能够在今年1至9月的二百多天中，实现了四百七十二件技术革新的建议，连克六十七处生产关键？为什么我们所熟悉的著名的走在时间前面的人——哈尔滨车辆厂的苏广铭，一直纵马疾驰，现在已经在干1970年的活了？为什么呢？群英会上的英雄们回答是一致的：为了洗净历史遗留给我们国土上的贫穷和落后的痕迹，为了在一个不太长的时间里把我们的国家建设成一个拥有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。
    人民群众实现自己的愿望，并不依靠上帝和神仙，他们的智慧和双手就是伟大的力量。困难吗？有的。要让本溪钢铁公司第一钢铁厂两座四十多年前建立起来的，被人称为“老掉牙”的旧式中型高炉高产优质，怎么可能没有困难呢？但是，本溪钢铁公司第一钢铁厂的职工并没有被困难吓倒。他们虚心学习别人的先进经验，大胆革新技术，终于创造了全国大中型高炉利用系数的最高纪录，并且已经连续十八个月保持了利用系数在全国大中型高炉中领先的地位。正如上海的工人所说：“困难像弹簧，看你强不强；你强他就弱，你弱他就强”。人民群众既然能把旧世界打得落花流水，也一定能在旧世界的废墟上建设起社会主义的幸福大厦来。
    人民群众建设社会主义的强烈愿望，是人类最美好的愿望；人民群众的力量，是世界上最伟大的力量。右倾机会主义分子对人类这种最美好的愿望和世间这种最伟大的力量大泼冷水，诬蔑为“小资产阶级的狂热性”，说这个“太快了”、那个“太早了”，说这个“搞糟了”、那个“得不偿失”了，总想阻挡社会主义建设群众运动的发展，这不是一种罪恶吗？
    什么人在人民群众建设社会主义的强烈愿望面前，才会有这样一副冷漠的表情呢？什么人在人民群众的力量面前，才会有这么多的不满和非难呢？只有资产阶级。人民群众建设社会主义的愿望是同资产阶级的利益背道而驰的，人民群众的力量是永远埋葬资本主义制度的激流。我们队伍里的右倾机会主义分子唱起同资产阶级一模一样的谰调，说明了他们反映的并不是如他们所说的是什么“马克思主义的观点”，而是彻头彻尾的资产阶级的观点，他们代表的并不是什么人民群众的利益，而是资产阶级的利益。
    高速度地建设社会主义，是人民群众最根本的利益，最热烈的愿望。“群英会”上六千多名代表的共同语言：是永远反右倾，永远高速度！
