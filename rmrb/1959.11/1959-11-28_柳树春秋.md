    Willow in Spring and Autumn
    Hai Bo
    When willow branches sprout, people know that spring has arrived. Its emerald green leaves and vibrant branches make people feel beautiful, fresh, and full of vigor. But all of this is just the external beauty of the spring willow. Recently, after reading about the heroic deeds of Wu Lianghu, a national advanced producer, I learned that the spring willow has an even greater inner beauty, which is its powerful vitality.
    Wu Lianghu is a young riveter at the Wuhan Jiang'an Vehicle Factory. He is famous for his courage in helping the backward catch up with the advanced. Since the beginning of this year, he has consciously helped four work groups in their work, enabling these four groups to quickly transform from backward to advanced, thereby changing the production outlook of the entire workshop and completing the national plan 135 days ahead of schedule. Someone asked him, "How do you do your work?" He said, "There is no trick, just listen to the Party's words, and wherever I go, I quickly integrate with the masses and move forward with them! Young people should be like willow branches in spring, taking root wherever they are planted."
    Wu Lianghu compares himself to a willow branch in spring, which is excellent, vivid, and appropriate. Isn't it so? As long as you break off a willow branch in spring and plant it in a suitable place, it will quickly combine with the soil, take root, and grow strong there. Wu Lianghu and the thousands upon thousands of selfless heroes of the Great Leap Forward are exactly like this. Wherever the Party assigns them, they do not talk about conditions, do not care about rewards, are not afraid of any difficulties, can work well in good conditions, and can work even better in bad conditions. No matter where they go, they can quickly integrate with the masses, take root and blossom among the masses, and quietly lead the masses to do their work well. How similar this is to the style of willow trees in spring.
    However, it would not be correct to completely equate the style of willow trees with the style of our heroes. The style of our heroes is higher and more beautiful than that of willow trees. Willow trees are indeed beautiful in the warm spring, when flowers are in bloom and the sun is shining; but in autumn, a gust of autumn wind blows, the leaves turn yellow, the branches wither, and the face becomes haggard and desolate. Our heroes are very different. They are not only noble and beautiful in the warm spring, but also in the hot summer, cool autumn, and cold winter. They are not restricted by any climatic conditions, and the more difficulties they encounter, the greater their enthusiasm and the stronger their vitality. Look, which hero was not born in the struggle against difficulties? Wu Lianghu is, and so are thousands upon thousands of people's heroes.
    But some people are not like this. They have a dual nature. When things are going smoothly, they become complacent; when they encounter difficulties, they wither like autumn willow trees. Those who suffer from right-leaning ideological illnesses are like this. When these people encounter a little difficulty in their work, they shout loudly: "The working conditions are not good!" "The plan is too high!" "If you want me to complete a certain task, you have to give me...!" In short, difficulties are like autumn winds in front of these people, and they are willing to be withered leaves, swept away by the autumn wind.
    Wu Lianghu and these heroes have a surging enthusiasm for building socialism, and they see the most important conditions, namely the leadership of the Party and the great power of the people! Therefore, they can rely on the masses everywhere, are bold, and are full of energy, like spring willows, full of vitality and forging ahead; while those with right-leaning emotions are the opposite. They lack this vitality to build socialism, so they are bound to be as weak as autumn willow trees.
    Our socialist construction is always spring, and all revolutionaries should always be like spring willows, full of vigor, while those suffering from right-leaning illnesses should quickly awaken in this great sunshine.

    柳树春秋
    海波
    柳枝一发芽，人们就知道：春来了。它那翠绿的叶儿，它那生气勃勃的枝桠，使人感到美丽、清新、生气蓬勃。但这一切不过是春柳外形的美。最近，看到全国先进生产者吴良湖的英雄事迹，我知道了春柳还有一种更伟大的内在美，这就是它那强有力的活力。
    吴良湖是武汉江岸车辆厂的青年铆工。他是以勇于帮助落后使落后赶上先进而著名的。他在今年以来，自觉地帮助四个工作小组进行工作，使这四个组由落后迅速变成先进，从而改变了整个车间的生产面貌，提前一百三十五天完成了国家计划。有人问他：“你是怎样进行工作的？”他说：“也没什么窍门，就是听党的话，走到哪里就很快和哪里的群众打成一片，并且和群众一起前进！青年人应该像春天的柳枝一样，插到哪里，活在哪里。”
    吴良湖把自己比作春天的柳枝，好极了，又生动，又恰当。不是么？春天的柳枝，只要你折下一枝，插在一个合适的地方，它就很快和土壤结合起来，在那里生根、成长壮大。吴良湖和千千万万舍己为人的大跃进中的英雄们，正是这样。党分配他们在哪里，他们不讲条件，不计报酬，什么困难也不怕，条件好也能干，条件坏更能干，他们无论走到哪里，都能很快和群众打成一片，在群众中生根开花，不声不响地带领群众把工作作好。这同春天柳树的风格多么相似。
    不过，如果把柳树的风格和我们的英雄们的风格完全等同起来，那就不对了。我们的英雄们的风格比柳树更高、更美。柳树，在春暖花开，日光融融的日子里的确美；但一到了秋天，一阵秋风吹过，叶儿黄了，枝儿枯了，面容憔悴，萧瑟可怜。而我们的英雄们却大不相同，他们不仅在温暖的春天风格那样高尚，那样美丽，他们即是在酷热的夏天、清冷的秋天，严寒的冬天都是如此。他们不受任何气候条件的限制，而且越是遇到困难，干劲越大，生命力越旺，请看，哪个英雄不是在同困难作斗争中诞生出来的，吴良湖是，千千万万的人民英雄都是。
    可是有些人不然，他们有两重性，在顺利的时候，得意忘形，在遇到困难的时候，他们就好像秋天的柳树那样衰萎，那些患有右倾思想病的人就是这样。这种人在工作中遇到一点困难，就大嚷大叫：“工作条件不好啦！”“计划太高啦！”“要我完成某某任务，就要给我……！”总之，困难在这些人面前有如秋风，而他们甘当枯叶，秋风一刮，也就席卷而去了。
    吴良湖这些英雄们有着澎湃的建设社会主义的热情，看到了最主要的条件，即党的领导，人的伟大力量！所以他们能处处依靠群众，胆子大，精神百倍，像春柳一样生气勃勃，奋勇前进；而有右倾情绪的人则相反，他们缺乏建设社会主义的这种活力，所以他们必然像秋天的柳树那样毫无气力。
    我们的社会主义建设永远是春天，一切革命者都应永远像春天的柳树那样，朝气勃勃，而那些右倾病患者，真应该在这大好阳光里赶快苏醒过来。
