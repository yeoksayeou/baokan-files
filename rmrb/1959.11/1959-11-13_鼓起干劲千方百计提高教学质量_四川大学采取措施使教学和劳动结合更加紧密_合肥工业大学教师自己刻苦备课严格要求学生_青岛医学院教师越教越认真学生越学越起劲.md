    Bolster Enthusiasm, Devise Every Possible Way to Improve Teaching Quality
    Sichuan University Takes Measures to Integrate Teaching and Labor More Closely
    Hefei University of Technology Teachers Prepare Lessons Diligently and Strictly Require Students
    Qingdao Medical College Teachers Teach More Seriously and Students Learn More Enthusiastically

    This newspaper reports, “Improving teaching quality is our practical action to practice increasing production and practicing economy,” This is the slogan of action for the majority of teachers and students of Sichuan University after studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. During the study, teachers and students examined various erroneous thoughts and viewpoints that did not conform to the general line and the spirit of the Great Leap Forward, and expressed their determination to implement the spirit of the general line into practical work and study. In order to make teaching and labor more closely linked, the Department of Chemistry assigned the analysis workshops of the chemical plant, such as analysis chemistry, organic chemistry, etc., to the responsible teaching and research groups according to their nature, so as to better organize on-site teaching and other activities in labor according to the needs of the curriculum. After the teachers teach the relevant courses, when they work with the students, they combine the explanation of the principles used in production to make the knowledge learned by the students more thorough and consolidated.
    In the new academic year, with the increase in the number of young teachers, Sichuan University has further strengthened the specific leadership of the work of training and improving the teaching staff in various departments of the school. In addition to helping the young teachers to formulate their own advanced study plans, the teaching and research groups have generally formulated guiding plans for training and improving the teaching staff, including the direction, requirements, measures, and time arrangements for advanced study. Many teaching and research groups have also established a supervision and inspection system, designating special personnel to be responsible for implementation.
    Due to the adoption of the above series of measures, the teaching work of various departments of Sichuan University has been significantly improved, teachers are teaching more seriously, and students are learning more enthusiastically. This year, the school's scientific research plan has completed more than 100 projects before the National Day, and many scientific research papers have reached a fairly high level.

    This newspaper reports, after the teachers and students of Hefei University of Technology have undergone an anti-rightist and energetic study movement, a vigorous new atmosphere has emerged in various tasks.

    Since the beginning of this semester, the teachers have been working very hard on teaching. They use all their time and try every possible way to collect information for lesson preparation, and strive to make the lectures lively and easy to understand. In order to have time to familiarize themselves with the textbooks, many teachers have achieved "ahead-of-time lesson preparation." The teachers in the Mathematics Teaching and Research Group had already written their lecture notes one month before the start of the course. In addition, the teachers' requirements for the students are also stricter than in the past. In addition to submitting homework on time, there are more comprehensive questions, proof questions, and text questions in the homework than in the past.

    Many courses this semester have added new content and improved quality. The Well and Alley Teaching and Research Group has enriched the teaching materials with new scientific research results. For example, the "Drilling and Blasting" course has added fluid dynamics theory, so that students can thoroughly understand the blasting principle from a theoretical perspective. In order to teach the course well, the teachers seize all the time, focus on the teaching tasks, and conscientiously read and study to improve themselves in all aspects.

    From the beginning of this semester, the students have shown soaring enthusiasm and are determined to cultivate themselves into knowledgeable intellectuals of the working class who are both red and expert. In the past, many people did not read professional reference books, but now they generally read professional reference books.

    This newspaper reports, inspired by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all teachers and students of Qingdao Medical College continue to deeply implement the Party's education policy. The teachers teach better and the students also learn better.

    According to the Party's education policy, under the specific leadership of the Party committee, the teaching and research groups of this school proposed to strengthen lesson preparation and improve the effectiveness of classroom lectures as one of the specific measures to do a good job in teaching. They generally established a lesson preparation system, in which the main lecturer first writes out the lesson plan, and then conducts trial lectures and discussions at the teaching and research group meeting. In this way, not only can in-depth research be done on the teaching objectives, requirements, and textbook content, but also thorough discussions can be made on teaching methods. Each teaching and research group also vigorously carries out scientific research work in conjunction with teaching and productive labor. The school originally planned to complete 61 scientific research projects before the National Day. After the anti-rightist and energetic efforts, the target was raised to 85 projects, and as a result, 157 projects were completed.

    The enthusiasm of the students for learning has also become higher. They unanimously stated that "we must study hard and be both red and expert in order to adapt to the needs of the country's continuous leap forward." Now, they have not only made great progress in terms of observing time, reading seriously, and organization and discipline, but also generally formulated study plans and strengthened the planning and initiative of learning.

    鼓起干劲千方百计提高教学质量
    四川大学采取措施使教学和劳动结合更加紧密
    合肥工业大学教师自己刻苦备课严格要求学生
    青岛医学院教师越教越认真学生越学越起劲
    本报讯　“提高教学质量，就是我们厉行增产节约的实际行动”，这是四川大学广大师生学习党的八届八中全会文件后的行动口号。在学习中，师生们检查了不符合总路线、大跃进精神的各种错误思想和观点，纷纷表示要把总路线的精神贯彻到实际工作和学习中去。为了使教学与劳动联系得更加紧密，化学系把化工厂的分析等车间按性质分别指定分析化学、有机化学等教研组负责，以便能更好地按课程需要在劳动中组织现场教学等活动。教师讲授有关课程以后，同学生一起劳动的时候，就结合讲解在生产中运用的原理，使学生学得的知识更加深入巩固。
    四川大学在新学年中，随着青年教师的增加，全校各系进一步加强了培养提高师资工作的具体领导。除了帮助青年教师本人订出进修计划以外，各教研组都普遍制订了培养提高师资的指导计划，包括进修方向、要求、措施和时间安排等方面。许多教研组还建立了督促检查制度，指定专人负责执行。
    由于采取以上一系列措施，四川大学各系的教学工作已经有了显著改进，教师愈教愈认真，学生越学越起劲。全校今年的科学研究计划，在国庆节前已经完成一百多项，不少科学研究论文达到相当高的水平。
    本报讯　合肥工业大学的师生，在经过反右倾、鼓干劲的学习运动后，各项工作出现了一片蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。
    这个学期以来，教师们对教学工作抓得很紧。他们利用一切时间，想尽一切办法搜集资料进行备课，力求把课讲得生动易懂。为了有时间熟悉教材，很多教师都做到“超前备课”，数学教研组的教师们在开课前一个月就把讲稿写好了。另外，教师对学生的要求也比过去严格了，除了要按时交作业外，作业中的综合性题目、证明题、文字题都比过去多了。
    这学期的很多课程都增加了新内容，提高了质量。井巷教研组把新的科学研究成果充实到教材中去，如“钻眼爆破”课就增加了流体动力学理论，使学生能从理论上透彻地理解爆破原理。为了把课教好，教师抓紧一切时间，围绕教学任务，认真读书进修备课，从各方面提高自己。
    学生们从这学期一开始，就表现出了冲天的干劲，决心把自己培养成又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。过去有许多人不看专业参考书，现在普遍阅读专业参考书了。
    本报讯　青岛医学院全体师生在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，继续深入贯彻党的教育方针，教师教得更好、学生也学得更好。
    根据党的教育方针，在党委的具体领导下，这个学校各教研组提出加强备课，提高课堂讲授效果，作为搞好教学的具体措施之一。他们普遍建立备课制度，由主讲教师先写出教案，再在教研组会上进行试讲和讨论。这样，不但对教学目的、要求和教材内容，能作深入的研究，对教学方法也能作到周密讨论。各教研组，还结合教学和生产劳动，大力进行科学研究工作。全校原计划国庆节前完成科学研究六十一项，在反右倾、鼓干劲以后，指标提高到八十五项，结果完成一百五十七项。
    广大学生学习的积极性也更加高涨了，他们一致表示“必须刻苦学习，作到又红又专，才能适应国家不断跃进的需要。”现在，他们不仅在遵守时间、认真读书以及组织性、纪律性方面有了很大进步，还普遍制订了学习规划，加强了学习的计划性和主动性。
