Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Commerce recently jointly issued a directive requiring agriculture and commerce departments at all levels in all regions to, under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, conscientiously and comprehensively arrange for livestock to spend the winter. Ensure that livestock are strong and healthy during the winter and spring seasons, and welcome continued leaps forward in agricultural production next year.

The directive requires: Agricultural and commercial departments should first help the people's communes to prepare for livestock to spend the winter, repair sheds and pens, add cold-proof equipment, and seize the opportunity to arrange for winter feed. After arrangements and calculations, if the feed is indeed insufficient, the commercial departments should adjust supplies from neighboring areas. In the autumn harvest distribution, in addition to reserving sufficient feed grain, they should also help the people's communes establish and improve the feeding and management system, select and fix feeding and management personnel; promote the excellent experience of draught animal feeding, and strengthen the protection of draught animals.

The directive said: Commercial and agricultural departments in all regions must seize the opportunity after the autumn harvest and before winter, organize forces, and go deep into the people's communes to help the communes conduct a comprehensive inventory of existing livestock. For livestock that can survive the winter and can continue to be used with careful feeding, they must be resolutely protected and fattened; old cattle and disabled cattle that have lost their ability to work and have no hope of recovery should be inspected by the local animal husbandry and veterinary station and approved by the commune's leading organs, and then purchased by the commercial department at a reasonable price, and then slaughtered or fattened according to different circumstances.

Agricultural and commercial departments must also promptly go deep into the communes to adjust the surplus and deficiency of livestock, strengthen the purchase and transportation of livestock, and complete this year's adjustment plan.

    做好准备保护牲畜过冬
    农业部商业部联合发出指示
    新华社3日讯　农业部、商业部最近联合发出指示，要求各地各级农业、商业部门，在当地党委统一领导下，认真全面的安排牲畜过冬事宜。使牲畜在冬春季节膘肥体壮，迎接明年农业生产继续跃进。
    指示要求：农、商部门首先应该帮助人民公社做好牲畜过冬准备工作，修补棚圈，增设防寒设备，抓紧时机安排好过冬饲草；经过安排算账，如饲草确实不足，商业部门应从邻近地区给予调剂。在秋收分配中除应留足饲料粮外，并应帮助人民公社建立与健全饲养管理制度，挑选、固定饲养管理人员；推广耕畜饲养的优良经验，加强耕畜保护工作。
    指示说：各地商业、农业部门必须在秋后冬前抓紧时机，组织力量，深入人民公社，帮助公社对现有牲畜进行全面排队。对于能够过冬而且经过精心饲养可以继续使用的牲畜，要坚决保护、养肥；确已失去劳役能力没有复壮希望的老牛和残废牛，经过当地畜牧兽医站检查、公社领导机关批准后，由商业部门用合理价格收购后，根据不同情况屠宰或育肥。
  农、商部门还必须及时深入公社调剂牲畜余缺，加强收购和牲畜的赶运工作，完成今年的调剂计划。
