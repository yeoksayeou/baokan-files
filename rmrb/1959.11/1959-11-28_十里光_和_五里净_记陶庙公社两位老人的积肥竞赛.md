"Ten Li Guang" and "Five Li Jing"
    —A Record of a Manure Accumulation Competition Between Two Elderly Men in Taomiao Commune
    In Taomiao Commune, Jieshou County, Anhui Province, the story of the manure accumulation competition between "Ten Li Guang" and "Five Li Jing" is widely circulated.
    "Ten Li Guang's" real name is Wu Tianxiang, and he is a member of the Zhao Ji Production Team in Taomiao Commune. He is sixty-two years old this year. Because of his outstanding performance in manure accumulation, he has cleared wild manure piles within a few "li" around the village. As a result, he has been named a manure accumulation model six times in the year since the commune was established. People who like to joke have given him the nickname "Ten Li Guang" (Ten Li Clean). "Five Li Jing" is three years older than "Ten Li Guang," and his real name is Zhao Weigang. He is in the same production brigade as "Ten Li Guang." This elderly man always carries a manure basket to collect manure around the village, regardless of whether it is sunny or rainy. Therefore, people call him "Five Li Jing" (Five Li Clean).
    When people who know these two elderly men are asked about them, they all say that they are like "peppers"—the older they get, the redder their hearts become. This spring, the commune launched a production upsurge. One day, Wu Tianxiang said to Zhao Weigang: "Brother Weigang, seeing how the young and middle-aged are all busy with production like dragons and tigers, we can't lag behind! Let's have a competition to see whose manure pile grows faster!" When "Five Li Jing" heard Wu Tianxiang issue the challenge, he was happy to say, "Okay, let's compete!"
    From that day on, they moved their respective manure pile bases to the roadside on the west side of the village, arranging them in a line. The growth of the two small hill-like manure piles became a daily marker of their competition results.
    "Ten Li Guang" likes to run long distances along the highway, as he believes that there are more people and animals coming and going on the highway, making it easier to pick up manure. His method is to pick it up in secluded places, in roadside ditches, pick on the west side of the road when the east wind blows, and on the east side of the road when the west wind blows. Due to his hard work and rich manure-picking experience, his manure accumulation results often exceed those of "Five Li Jing." However, "Five Li Jing" is not willing to admit defeat either. He adopted another way to find manure: circling around the fields and construction sites where many people are working. A few days ago, he discovered that there were many workers building a highway south of the village, so he carried his manure basket and rushed there. In one morning, he picked up fifteen loads of human and animal manure. At the end of October, when the commune was selling public grain, the grain station was crowded with people and animals. Zhao Weigang was very happy. When he returned home, he used sorghum stalks to weave two large pieces of fence and carried them to the grain station, building two toilets in a secluded place. In a few days, his manure pile also surpassed "Ten Li Guang's" manure pile. When "Ten Li Guang" saw that "Five Li Jing" was doing this with great effect, he also built two toilets with sorghum stalks at a water conservancy construction site not far from the village, and his manure pile quickly caught up with "Five Li Jing's" again. They have been secretly chasing and openly competing, and neither of them is willing to fall behind.
    Although they compete openly and chase secretly, they cooperate very well. One day at the end of October, "Ten Li Guang" ran farther away from the village and picked up so much manure that he couldn't pull it back to the village alone. If he waited until the next day to pull it, he felt it wouldn't be worthwhile. When "Five Li Jing" found out, he immediately took the initiative to push his cart over. Before dark, the two of them together transported the two large carts of manure back to the village.
    In this way, the story of "Ten Li Guang" and "Five Li Jing" picking up manure spread throughout the area.

    “十里光”和“五里净”
    ——记陶庙公社两位老人的积肥竞赛
    在安徽界首县陶庙公社，传颂着“十里光”和“五里净”积肥竞赛的故事。
      “十里光”真名叫吴天祥，是陶庙公社赵集生产队的社员，今年已经六十二岁了。由于他积肥工作搞得出色，把庄子附近几里地拾得看不见野粪堆，所以在公社成立一年来，就六次被评为积肥模范。好说笑话的人给他取了个绰号，叫做“十里光”。“五里净”比“十里光”大三岁，真名赵维刚，和“十里光”同在一个生产大队。这老人也是不管天晴或下雨，总是背着粪筐在庄子附近拾粪。因而人们管他叫“五里净”。
    提起这两位老人，相识的人都说，他们是属“辣椒”的，人越老心越红。今年春天，社里掀起了生产高潮。一天，吴天祥对赵维刚说：“维刚哥，眼见青壮年个个如龙似虎地忙生产，咱俩可别落后啊！也来个竞赛，看看谁的粪堆长得快！”“五里净”一听吴天祥下了战表，也乐得连忙说：“好，咱俩就赛一赛吧！”
    从那天起，他们就把各人的粪堆基地移到庄西头的路边，一字形的排列着。两座小丘似的粪堆的增长，成了他们每天竞赛成绩的标记。
    “十里光”喜欢沿着公路跑远道，他认为公路来往的人、畜多，容易拾到粪。他采取的办法是：在背静地里拾，在沿路沟道里拾，刮东风往路西边拾，刮西风往路东边拾。由于他的苦干精神，加上丰富的拾粪经验，他的积肥成绩经常超过“五里净”。可是“五里净”也并不服输。他采取了另一种找粪门路：在干活人多的田头和工地附近转圈圈。前些天，他发现庄南边有许多工人修公路，便背着粪筐赶去了，在一个上午，就拾了人畜粪十五担。10月底，赶上社里卖公粮，粮站里人山人海、牛马牲口络绎不绝，赵维刚心里好不高兴，回到家里自个儿用秫秸编成两大块篱笆，扛到粮站旁，在背静地里搭了两个厕所。不几天，他的粪堆也赶过了“十里光”的粪堆了。“十里光”见“五里净”这样做效果很大，便也照样用秫秸在离庄子不远的一个水利工地上搭了两个厕所，他的粪堆又很快地赶上了“五里净”。他们一直是暗中追、明中比，谁也不肯落后。
    虽然他们明比暗追，可是合作得很好。10月底的一天，“十里光”跑得离村远了些，拾的粪一人无法拉回村，要是第二天再拉，又觉不合算。“五里净”知道后，连忙主动地推着车子赶去，不到天黑，两人便一道把两大车粪全部运回庄。
    就这样，“十里光”和“五里净”拾粪的事儿就在这一带传开了。
