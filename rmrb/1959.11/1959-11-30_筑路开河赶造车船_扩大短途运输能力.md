Build Roads, Open Rivers, and Rush to Manufacture Vehicles and Ships to Expand Short-Distance Transportation Capacity
Lead the Mass Movement Towards Tool Innovation; Indigenous Machinery and Indigenous Railways Save Labor

Xinhua News Agency, November 29th: Recently, various regions across the country have been vigorously building roads, opening rivers, and rushing to manufacture vehicles and ships, making every effort to expand short-distance transportation capacity.

The transportation construction work in various regions is closely integrated with the mass movement for short-distance transportation. Its purpose is to realize the "one network, five-izations" of short-distance transportation. The one network is the short-distance transportation network, and the five-izations are the vehicularization of land transportation, the ship transportation of water transportation, the railization of industrial and mining areas and areas with particularly busy transportation, the cableway and chute-ization of high mountains and steep slopes, and the mechanization and indigenous mechanization of loading and unloading operations at ports, stations, and freight yards. Heilongjiang Province has built and improved more than 20,000 kilometers of roads and manufactured and repaired a total of more than 97,000 two-wheeled, four-wheeled, and rubber-tired vehicles. Currently, in Sichuan Province, more than 150 ports and wharves across the province have initially achieved indigenous mechanization. More than ten special districts, cities, and counties have their short-distance transportation teams using vehicles and ships for all transport. More than 130 kilometers of small and indigenous railways have been built, greatly improving transportation efficiency.

In order to use machines to drive wooden sailing ships and tow barges, southern provinces are universally carrying out the matching installation of small horsepower engines on wooden sailing ships. Among them, Hunan and Jiangsu provinces have completed the matching of more than 400 sets of small horsepower engines. According to calculations by the Ministry of Communications, when all of the small horsepower engines allocated by the state to wooden sailing ships this year are installed on ships and towing is implemented, it will be equivalent to increasing the carrying capacity of wooden sailing ships by more than 400,000 tons.

The biggest characteristic of transportation construction in various regions is adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and relying on self-reliance. In order to manufacture wooden sailing ships, Anhui Province moved some shipyards to timber-producing areas upstream of rivers to fell trees and build ships on the spot. As a result, the ships were built quickly and economically. So far, the province has built wooden sailing ships and a batch of wooden barges with a carrying capacity of more than 20,000 tons. When building roads, Keshan and other counties in Gansu Province lacked rolling machinery, so they adopted methods such as layered compaction, manual or horse-powered roller compaction, and tractor-towed roller compaction instead, which also ensured the quality of road surface compaction. The reed mat boats successfully trial-produced in Hebei Province recently and the bamboo strip boats in Sichuan Province are both creations of using local materials to repair and manufacture transportation tools.

The Ministry of Communications recently instructed transportation departments in various regions to build a large number of roads; vigorously develop waterways; actively build small and indigenous railways on lines with large fixed material transportation; build various transportation tools in large quantities; and actively promote the mechanization and indigenous mechanization of loading, unloading, and handling operations in ports, stations, and freight yards.

### 筑路开河赶造车船  扩大短途运输能力

    筑路开河赶造车船  扩大短途运输能力
    把群众运动引向革新工具  土机械土铁路节约劳动力
    据新华社29日讯　全国各地近来大力筑路、开河、赶造车船，千方百计地扩大短途运输能力。
    各地的交通建设工作，是密切地结合短途运输群众运动进行的。它的目的，是为了实现短途运输的“一网五化”。一网是短途运输网，五化是陆运的车子化，水运的船运化，工矿区和运输特别繁忙地区的轨道化，高山陡坡地区的索道、溜槽化，港口、车站、货场装卸工作的机械化和土机械化。黑龙江省已经修筑和改善公路两万多公里，制造和修理了双轮、四轮和胶轮车共九万七千多辆。四川省目前全省已有一百五十多个港口码头初步实现了土机械化，有十多个专区、市、县的短途运输队伍全部用车、船运输，修建了一百三十多公里小铁路、土铁路，从而大大提高了运输效率。
    南方各省为了用机器带动木帆船和拖带驳船，正在普遍进行木帆船小马力机的配套安装工作，其中湖南、江苏两省完成了四百多套小马力机的配套工作。据交通部计算，今年国家分配给各地木帆船的这种小马力机全部安装上船并实行拖带以后，等于增加四十多万吨木帆船的运力。
    各地交通建设的最大特点，是因地制宜、就地取材、自力更生。安徽省为了制造木帆船，把一部分造船厂搬到河流上游的木材产地，就地伐木造船，船造好后顺流而下。因此，船造得又快又省。到目前为止，这个省已经造了载重能力两万多吨的木帆船和一批木驳船。甘肃省克山等县筑路时缺乏碾压机具，就采用分层夯实、人力或马力碾子碾压、拖拉机拖带滚筒排压等办法来代替，也保证了路面压实的质量。最近河北省试制成功的苇席船和四川省的竹篾船，也都是就地取材修造运输工具的创造。
    交通部最近指示各地交通部门大量修筑道路；大力开发航道；在有大宗固定物资运输的线路上积极修建小、土铁路；大造各种运输工具；积极推行港口、车站、货场装卸搬运工作的机械化和土机械化。（附图片）
