    Private Debt Soars
    Up 160% From End of 1950
    (Our newspaper dispatch) According to official U.S. statistics, the growth rate of private debt in the United States has far exceeded the growth rate of personal income after taxes.
    A recent report in the "Wall Street Journal" stated that in the past decade, the growth rate of personal debt in the United States has been more than double the growth rate of their personal disposable (i.e., after-tax) income. At the end of 1950, the private debt in the United States was 66.5 billion U.S. dollars, and today it is 176.2 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of about 160%. However, during the same period, personal disposable income increased from 207 billion U.S. dollars to 335 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of only about 61%. As a result, the proportion of personal debt in personal income rose from 32% in 1950 to 51% this year.
    This situation has caused concern among many economists. "Business Week" stated: Many economists worry that the public will start a new, chaotic spending spree. An economist in Boston said: "People can't keep going on like this forever. At some point, (debt) expenditure will exceed disposable income."
    Saulnier, Chairman of the U.S. President's Council of Economic Advisers, said on October 26 at the American Bankers Association that the current rate of debt growth is faster than in 1955, and the growth of consumer debt at that time greatly contributed to the subsequent recession.

### 私人负债激增  比1950年底增加160％

    私人负债激增
    比1950年底增加160％
    本报讯　据美国官方统计，美国私人负债数字的增长速度，已远超过纳税后的个人收入增长速度。
    最近“华尔街日报”的一则报道说，在近十年中，美国个人债务增长的速度，比他们个人可以自由支配的（即纳税后）的收入增长的速度快一倍还要多。1950年底美国的私人债务是六百六十五亿美元，今天是一千七百六十二亿美元，约增加了160％。但同时期个人可以自由支配的收入，却从二千零七十亿美元增加到三千三百五十亿美元，仅增加了约61％。结果个人债务在个人收入中所占的比重从1950年的32％，上升到今年的51％。
    这种情况已引起很多经济界人士的不安。“商业周刊”说：许多经济学者担心公众会掀起一个新的乱哄哄的花费热潮。一个波士顿的经济学家则说：“人们总不能老是这样下去，到一定程度，（债务）支出就会超过可以自由支配的收入”。
    美国总统的经济顾问委员会主席骚尼尔10月26日在美国银行家协会上说，目前这项债务增长的速度比1955年还要快，而当时消费者债务的增长曾大大促成了以后的衰退。
