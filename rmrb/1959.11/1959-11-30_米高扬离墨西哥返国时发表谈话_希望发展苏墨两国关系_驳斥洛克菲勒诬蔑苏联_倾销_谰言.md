Xinhua News Agency, November 29th dispatch: TASS, Mexico City dispatch: Soviet First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mikoyan and his entourage departed Mexico by plane on the 28th to return home.

While on the plane, Mikoyan sent a telegram to Mexican President López Mateos, thanking the Mexican government and people for their warm reception.

Xinhua News Agency, November 29th dispatch: TASS, Mexico City, November 28th dispatch: Soviet First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mikoyan held a press conference at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico on the 27th. Mikoyan spoke on the issue of strengthening Soviet-Mexican relations and also discussed his impressions of his visit to Mexico. Mikoyan emphasized that the Mexican people gave us a very good reception, which confirms the mutual desire of both peoples for friendship.

He pointed out that it is definitely possible for Mexico and the Soviet Union to expand contacts and ties in the fields of economy, science, technology, culture, and art.

Xinhua News Agency, November 29th dispatch: TASS, Mexico City, November 28th dispatch: Soviet First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mikoyan delivered a speech at a banquet held in his honor by the Mexican National Association of Importers and Exporters on the 27th.

Mikoyan said that international trade is a means of strengthening universal peace, and the Soviet Union advocates trade based on equality and mutual benefit. However, there are still people who oppose trade. This is an echo of the dying "Cold War."

Mikoyan then addressed the so-called "Soviet dumping" of tin and other lies spread by people like New York Governor Rockefeller. He pointed out that the purpose of these people in fabricating such lies is to attempt to provoke countries like Bolivia that produce tin to oppose the Soviet Union. But the Soviet Union has never implemented any dumping policy, nor would it ever adopt such a policy. Mikoyan said that the Soviet Union is in principle opposed to any dumping.

Mikoyan pointed out that a female U.S. Senator had said: "The United States dumps grain abroad in exchange for billions of dollars in foreign exchange." Mikoyan said, and what about copper? Who is to blame for lowering the price of Chilean copper? The Soviet Union does not sell copper on the international market; on the contrary, it buys copper. We do not sell coffee, but who is it and why is it that reduces the price of coffee? He then quoted material from the United Nations' 1958 World Economic Survey report saying that "Raw material producing countries lost more than two billion US dollars in actual income and import capacity in one year from 1957 to 1958." He pointed out that this is precisely the abnormal situation that should be striven to eliminate, instead of ridiculously fabricating rumors of "dumping" on the Soviet Union.

    米高扬离墨西哥返国时发表谈话
    希望发展苏墨两国关系
    驳斥洛克菲勒诬蔑苏联“倾销”谰言
    据新华社29日讯　据塔斯社墨西哥城讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬及其随行人员28日乘飞机由墨西哥启程回国。
    在飞机上，米高扬打电报给墨西哥总统洛佩兹·马特奥斯，感谢墨西哥政府和人民的殷勤接待。
    据新华社29日讯　塔斯社墨西哥城28日讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬27日在苏联驻墨西哥大使馆举行记者招待会。米高扬就加强苏联同墨西哥关系的问题发表了谈话，同时谈了他对访问墨西哥的印象。米高扬着重说，墨西哥人很好地接待了我们，这一点就证实我们双方渴望两国人民友好。
    他指出，墨西哥同苏联在经济、科学、技术、文化和艺术方面扩大接触和联系，肯定是有可能的。
    据新华社29日讯　据塔斯社墨西哥城28日讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬27日在墨西哥全国进出口协会为他举行的宴会上发表了演说。
    米高扬说，国际贸易是加强普遍和平的手段，苏联主张平等互利的贸易。但是，现在仍然有人反对贸易。这是即将灭亡的“冷战”发出的回声。
    米高扬接着谈到美国纽约州州长洛克菲勒这些人的所谓“苏联倾销”锡这类谎言。他指出，这些人制造这类谎言的目的是企图挑拨像玻利维亚这些产锡国家来反对苏联。但是苏联从来没有执行过什么倾销政策，也决不可能采用这种政策。米高扬说，苏联在原则上反对任何倾销。
    米高扬指出，美国一个女参议员说过：“美国向外倾销粮食以换取数十亿美元的外汇。”米高扬说，还有铜，降低智利铜的价格又是谁的过错呢？苏联并没有在国际市场上出售铜，相反的是购买铜。我们不出售咖啡，但是，到底是谁和为什么要降低咖啡的价格呢？他接着又引用联合国1958年世界经济概况报告中的材料说：“生产原料的国家从1957年到1958年一年间在实际收入和入口能力方面损失了二十多亿美元”。他指出，这正是应该力图消除的不正常的情况，而不是荒唐地在苏联身上制造“倾销”的谰言。
