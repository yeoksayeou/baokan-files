　　Xinhua News Agency report: In the West German court in Düsseldorf where peace fighters are being tried, the defendants' speeches have become indictments of the West German authorities. The defendants, in their statements to the court, described how they became active peace fighters. All of them personally experienced the suffering of war and therefore consciously chose the path of opposing war. Two of them—Eckert, a member of the World Peace Council, and Wollrath, a member of the German Peace Committee (West Germany)—are facing persecution for their anti-war activities for not the first time. They said in court that as early as the 1930s they had been accused of "treason" by the Hitler judicial authorities for opposing militarism and fascism.
　　The youngest of the defendants, Thiel, a member of the World Peace Council, said that the desire to prevent the remilitarization of West Germany led him to join the ranks of West German peace advocates.
　　Kompara, a member of the German Peace Committee, said in court that participating in the war and later becoming an American prisoner of war determined the path of his future life. His main goal is to completely rid Germany of militarism.
　　All the defendants unanimously stated that they consciously fought for peace and against war, and are determined to uphold their activities in court with pride. In his speech, Eckert emphasized the great achievements of the worldwide movement to defend peace.
　　Pastor Oberhof, a member of the German (West Germany) Peace Committee, said that there was no basis for the indictment against him. He said, "I have not committed any of the crimes alleged by the state prosecutor." He said that after attending the peace conference in Warsaw, he personally realized that the World Peace Council is not an organization pursuing any special communist goals, but an organization that unites people of different political views to fight for the maintenance of peace. Oberhof spoke of the illegal police terror tactics taken by the Bonn government against West German peace fighters. He emphasized that peace fighters are being persecuted by the police for actions that do not violate the West German constitution but are not in line with the interests of the Adenauer government. He recounted the government's police persecution of the referendum on demilitarization held in West Germany.
　　The presiding judge asked him, "Do you support disarmament?" He firmly replied, "Yes. I support disarmament by all countries, and I am sincerely pleased with the proposal of Soviet Premier Khrushchev for complete disarmament."
　　Eckert, a member of the World Peace Council, said in his speech that this trial is an attempt to ban the peace movement in West Germany through the trial of a few individuals. We are not afraid of this trial, and we will continue to oppose the Bonn government's war policy. We advocate the peaceful development of Germany; we advocate that Germans should never fight each other again. Eckert concluded by saying: This trial confirms the necessity and importance of the World Peace Movement and the German Peace Committee's activities.
　　The West German authorities' unreasonable trial of peace fighters has been unanimously condemned by public opinion around the world.
　　The World Federation of Trade Unions spokesman, Gross, said that efforts must be made to stop the false accusations against West German peace fighters and stop the Düsseldorf court's trial aimed at suppressing the West German peace and democratic forces. Gross called on all trade union members to rise up to defend the defendants in Düsseldorf.
　　The Polish Committee for the Defense of Peace believes that the Düsseldorf trial is another attempt by the West German ruling clique to defame the struggle of German patriots for peace, for friendly cooperation between the German people and their neighbors, and against the atomic armament of the Bundeswehr.
　　The Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace protested against this atrocity by the West German authorities. In a letter to the Düsseldorf court, the committee emphasized that this trial is aimed at opposing the legitimate desire of the West German residents for peace.
　　Pilinsky, Vice-Chairman of the Bulgarian National Committee for the Defense of Peace, told a "Neues Deutschland" reporter that the Bulgarian public is deeply indignant about the trial of West German peace fighters in Düsseldorf.
　　Pilinsky said that the purpose of this trial, staged in the style of Hitler, is to slander peace fighters in West Germany and around the world and to divert the attention of the West German public from the universal desire of the people of all countries to eliminate the "Cold War" and establish lasting peace.
　　The Soviet "Trud" published on the 21st an article by Solovyov, a member of the World Peace Council, on this event, entitled "Persecution Must Not Be Allowed." He wrote that the events currently taking place in West Germany prove that there is a considerable force there seeking to continue to implement the "Cold War" policy and revive revanchism and militarism, seeking to retain a source of international tension in the heart of Europe.
　　The attempt to ban the German anti-fascist organization—the Association of Nazi Victims—and the despicable trial of prominent West German social activists that began in Düsseldorf on November 10th all prove this point.
　　The Norwegian "Friheten" published a conversation with Ragnar Forbech, a well-known Norwegian social activist and winner of the Lenin Prize "For Strengthening Peace Among Peoples". Forbech said that the entire "crime" of the German (West German) Peace Committee turned out to be: it opposes the armament of West Germany, opposes conscription, opposes West Germany's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and opposes West German atomic armament and the rise of militarism.
　　Forbech expressed the hope that the protests of peace maintainers around the world will lead to the victory of justice—stopping the trial and releasing the defendants.

### 对和平战士的审讯变成了对军国主义的控诉  西德和平战士在法庭上宣扬和平真理  世界公众舆论一致谴责西德当局倒行逆施

    对和平战士的审讯变成了对军国主义的控诉
    西德和平战士在法庭上宣扬和平真理
    世界公众舆论一致谴责西德当局倒行逆施
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在西德杜塞尔多夫审讯和平战士的法庭上，被告们的发言成了对西德当局的控诉。被告们在法庭上发言时讲述了他们是怎样成为积极的和平战士的。他们所有的人都亲身经受过战争的苦难，因而自觉地选择了反对战争的道路；其中两个人——世界和平理事会理事艾克特和德国和平委员会（西德）委员沃尔拉特因为反对战争活动而遭受迫害已经不是第一次了。他们在法庭上说，早在三十年代他们就曾经因为反对军国主义和法西斯主义而被希特勒司法机关控为“叛国”罪犯。
    被告中最年轻的人、世界和平理事会理事迪尔说，阻止西德重新军国主义化的愿望使他加入了西德和平拥护者的队伍。
    德国和平委员会委员康帕拉在法庭上说，参加战争以及后来作了美国俘虏决定了他未来生活的道路。他的主要目标就是使德国彻底摆脱军国主义。
    全体被告一致说，他们是自觉地为和平、为反对战争而斗争的，并且决心以自豪的心情在法庭上坚持他们的这种活动。艾克特在发言中着重指出了全世界保卫和平运动取得的巨大成就。
    德国（西德）和平委员会委员奥伯霍福牧师说，对他起诉是没有根据的。他说，我没有犯过国家检察署提出的任何一种罪过。他说，他到华沙参加和平大会以后，亲身体会到世界和平理事会不是追求共产党人的某种特别的目的的组织，而是团结不同政治观点的人们为维护和平而奋斗的组织。奥伯霍福讲了波恩政府对西德和平战士采取的非法的警察恐怖手段。他强调指出，和平战士由于并不违反西德宪法然而却不符合阿登纳政府的利益的行动遭到警察迫害。他追述了政府对在西德举行关于非军国主义化的全民投票的警察迫害。
    法庭庭长问他：“你拥护不拥护裁军？”他坚定地回答说：“拥护。我拥护一切国家裁军，而且我为苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫关于全面裁军的建议感到衷心高兴。”
    世界和平理事会理事艾克特在发言中说，这次审讯就是企图通过对几个人的审判在西德禁止和平运动。我们不怕这种审判，我们将继续反对波恩政府的战争政策。我们主张德国的和平发展；主张德国人永远不互相打仗。艾克特最后说：这次审讯证实了世界和平运动和西德和平委员会展开活动的必要性和重要性。
    西德当局无理审讯和平战士的行动，遭到世界各国公众舆论的一致谴责。
    世界工会联合会发言人格罗斯说，必须设法阻止对西德和平战士的诬告和制止杜塞尔多夫法庭目的在于压制西德和平民主力量的审讯。格罗斯号召全体工会会员起来保卫杜塞尔多夫的被告。
    波兰保卫和平委员会认为，杜塞尔多夫的审讯是西德统治集团又一次企图诋毁德国爱国者争取和平、争取德国人民同他们的邻国友好合作、反对联邦国防军的原子武装的斗争。
    越南保卫世界和平委员会抗议西德当局的这种暴行。委员会在给杜塞尔多夫法庭的信中强调指出，这次审讯是为了反对西德居民对于和平的合理愿望。
    保加利亚保卫和平全国委员会副主席皮林斯基对“新德意志报”记者说，保加利亚公众对在杜塞尔多夫对西德和平战士的审讯深感愤慨。
    皮林斯基说，这个按照希特勒式上演的审讯所追求的目的是诽谤西德和全世界的和平战士，并转移西德公众对于各国人民要求消除“冷战”和建立持久和平的普遍愿望的注意。
    苏联“劳动报”21日刊登了世界和平理事会理事索洛维耶夫就这一事件发表的文章，题目是“不允许迫害”。他写道，目前在西德发生的事件证明，在那里有相当大的一股势力力求继续执行“冷战”政策和复活复仇主义和军国主义的政策，力求在欧洲的心脏保留国际紧张局势的策源地。
    企图取缔德国反法西斯组织——纳粹受害者协会以及11月10日在杜塞尔多夫开始进行的对西德著名社会活动家的卑鄙的审讯都证明了这一点。
    挪威“自由报”刊登了挪威著名社会活动家、“加强国际和平”列宁奖金获得者拉格纳·福贝克牧师发表的谈话。福贝克说，德国（西德）和平委员会的全部“罪行”原来是：它反对武装西德，反对兵役法，反对西德加入北大西洋公约组织，反对西德原子军备和军国主义的抬头。
    福贝克表示希望，全世界的和平维护者的抗议将引向正义的胜利——停止审讯和释放被告。
