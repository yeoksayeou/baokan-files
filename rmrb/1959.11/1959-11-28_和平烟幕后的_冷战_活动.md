    "Cold War" Activities Behind the Smoke Screen of Peace
    By a commentator of this newspaper
    The debate on the Korean issue in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, following the so-called "Tibetan issue" and "Hungarian issue" within the United Nations, has once again exposed the trick of the United States, which pays lip service to peace but in reality continues the "Cold War."
    The United Nations General Assembly originally had no right to discuss the Korean issue; it only has the obligation to urge the American aggressor troops occupying South Korea to withdraw from Korea, so that the Korean people can achieve the reunification of their motherland on a democratic basis without foreign interference. The discussions and resolutions passed by the United Nations General Assembly on the Korean issue have always been a trick used by the United States to cover up its aggressive conspiracy against Korea, obstruct a genuine solution to the Korean issue, and maintain tension in the Far East. The so-called "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" has played the role of a docile tool for the American aggressive bloc. The United States has deliberately created artificial obstacles to the resolution of the Korean issue year after year, adding disgraceful records to each session of the United Nations General Assembly.
    At this year's United Nations General Assembly, the United States once again rehashed the old drama, repeating the old tune, attempting to continue obstructing the resolution of the Korean issue. The United States, from the very beginning in the UN Political Committee, coerced the majority it manipulated to refuse the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion, while allowing the representatives of the Syngman Rhee puppet clique to rant and rave at the meeting, maliciously slandering the Soviet Union, China, and the Korean government. This fully exposes the United States' shameful conspiracy to use the United Nations to conduct the "Cold War" on the Korean issue. Because everyone knows that it is fundamentally impossible to resolve the issue of Korean reunification without the participation of the true representatives of the Korean people.
    The US proposal essentially refuses to withdraw its aggressor troops from South Korea, permanently occupying South Korea, and repeating the so-called "free elections" under UN supervision is just self-deception. The unreasonableness and impracticality of this absurd proposition have been widely recognized. The US military's occupation of South Korea is the main obstacle to the peaceful reunification of Korea. Under the bayonet threat of the US aggressor army, there can be no "free election." The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly put forward reasonable proposals for peaceful reunification, advocating that after all foreign troops are completely withdrawn from South Korea, free elections should be held throughout Korea under conditions that can fully guarantee the free will of the people in both North and South Korea, in order to achieve the reunification of Korea. If the United States is really willing to achieve the reunification of Korea, willing to ease tensions in the Far East, and willing to maintain peace, as it claims, what reason is there for it not to accept the suggestions of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea? What reason is there to refuse to withdraw its troops from South Korea?
    The fact is very clear: the United States' aim is to permanently occupy South Korea and use South Korea as its base for aggression in the Far East. Recently, the United States has stepped up the expansion of its military power in South Korea, transporting large quantities of atomic weapons and missiles into South Korea. This fact, which seriously threatens peace in Asia, can by no means be covered up by the United States' empty talk of reversing black and white in the United Nations General Assembly. The old drama staged by the United States in the UN Political Committee can only make people see more clearly: the United States is still adhering to its policy of aggression against Korea, still adhering to the "Cold War" policy of maintaining tension in the Far East, and is using every opportunity to prevent the easing of the international situation, especially the situation in the Far East.
    Things are becoming increasingly clear. The United States' infamous record in the United Nations in just these few days fully proves that the United States is engaging in activities hostile to peace under the guise of seeking peace. If anyone had any doubts about this before, they should now fully understand.

    和平烟幕后的“冷战”活动
    本报评论员
    联合国大会政治委员会就朝鲜问题进行的辩论，是在联合国内继所谓“西藏问题”和“匈牙利问题”之后，又一次拆穿了美国口头上侈谈和平、实际上继续“冷战”的花招。
    联合国大会本来就根本没有权利讨论朝鲜问题，它只有义务促使强占着南朝鲜的美国侵略军队撤出朝鲜，使朝鲜人民能够不受外国势力干涉，在民主基础上实现祖国的统一。历届联合国大会关于朝鲜问题的讨论和所通过的决议，一直是美国利用来掩盖它对朝鲜的侵略阴谋、阻挠朝鲜问题获得真正解决和保持远东紧张局势的把戏，而那个所谓“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会”则在其中扮演了充当美国侵略集团的驯服工具的角色。美国就是这样年复一年地故意对朝鲜问题的解决制造人为的障碍，给每一届联合国大会增添不光彩的记录。
    在今年的联合国大会上，美国又一次照样旧戏重排，旧调重弹，企图继续阻挠朝鲜问题的解决。美国在联大政委会中一开始就挟持它所操纵的多数，拒绝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加讨论，而让李承晚傀儡集团的代表在会上信口雌黄，对苏联、中国和朝鲜政府进行恶毒诽谤，这就充分暴露美国利用联合国在朝鲜问题上进行“冷战”的可耻阴谋。因为谁都知道，在没有朝鲜人民的真正代表参加的情况下，是根本不可能解决朝鲜的统一问题的。
    美国的提案实质上是拒绝从南朝鲜撤退它的侵略军队，永远霸占南朝鲜，而重弹所谓在联合国监督下举行“自由选举”，只不过是自欺欺人而已。这种荒谬主张的不合理和不现实，已为人所共见。美国军队强占着南朝鲜是和平统一朝鲜的主要障碍，在美国侵略军的刺刀威胁之下，不可能有什么“自由选举”。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府一再提出和平统一朝鲜的合理方案，主张在一切外国军队从南朝鲜完全撤走之后，在能够完全保证南北朝鲜人民表示自由意志的条件下实行全朝鲜的自由选举，以实现朝鲜的统一。美国如果真是像它自己所说的那样，愿意实现朝鲜的统一，愿意缓和远东紧张局势，愿意维护和平，有什么理由不接受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的建议呢？有什么理由拒绝把自己的军队从南朝鲜撤走呢？
    事实很明白，美国的目的是要永远霸占南朝鲜，把南朝鲜作为它在远东进行侵略的基地。最近以来美国加紧扩充它在南朝鲜的军事力量，把大批原子武器和导弹运进南朝鲜。这种严重威胁亚洲和平的事实，决非美国在联合国大会中颠倒黑白的空谈所能掩盖得了的。美国在联大政委会中演出的一出陈旧的剧目，只能使人看得更清楚：美国仍然坚持对朝鲜的侵略政策，仍然坚持在远东保持紧张局势的“冷战”政策，并且正在利用一切机会来阻止国际局势特别是远东局势的缓和。
    事情是越来越明显了，单单这些天来美国在联合国中的恶名昭彰的记录就充分证明：美国正以伪装谋求和平的姿态，进行敌视和平的勾当，如果前些日子谁对这点还有什么怀疑的话，现在该完全明白了。
