Great Ideals
——Watching the Soviet Science Fiction Film "The Sky Calls"
Xi Zezong

In the Han Dynasty book "Huainanzi" there is the story of Chang'e flying to the moon, and the Dunhuang grottoes from the Tang Dynasty have frescoes of "flying apsaras". For thousands of years, people have dreamed of flying to other planets to see what they are like. However, these were only myths and fantasies. Only in today's atomic age, in socialist Soviet Union, can these fantasies be transformed into scientific reality. From 1957 to 1958, in less than two years, the Soviet Union successfully launched three artificial Earth satellites, each larger and higher than the last. This year alone, three more cosmic rockets were launched: the first became the first artificial planet in the solar system; the second accurately hit the moon; and the third circled the far side of the moon, taking the first ever picture of the moon's "unseen face" at a distance of 470,000 kilometers from Earth. The photograph was so clear when transmitted back to Earth that it revealed an age-old mystery. It turned out that the side of the moon facing away from us differs in form from the side facing us: the far side has more mountains than plains and depressions, and the mountains are not only numerous but also high, with a Soviet mountain range stretching for two thousand kilometers; there is a sea three hundred kilometers wide, which is the Moscow Sea, and the bay south of it is the Cosmonauts' Bay. Plans for cosmonauts to fly to the moon, Mars, and Venus are already on the agenda. The recently released Soviet color story fantasy film "The Sky Calls" tells the story of Soviet scientists opening up the road to Mars. Although the story itself is a fantasy, it has great real-world possibilities, because the interstellar transportation station and other things that appear in the film are basically solved problems.

The film depicts the Soviet "Motherland" spacecraft landing on a Soviet interstellar transportation station rotating tens of thousands of kilometers in the air. Just as stationmaster Demchenko and Kornev, who is flying to Mars, are studying the flight route, Western journalists Wirst and interstellar traveler Klarke, who is preparing to fly to Mars, ask him to use the Soviet interstellar transportation station as a transit station for flying to Mars. Demchenko agreed to their request and received them. However, when the capitalists who were driving the scientists to work for them learned that the Soviet "Motherland" spacecraft was also going to fly to Mars, they temporarily changed their plans and, regardless of the danger to human life, ordered them to take off immediately. After taking off, the "Typhoon" lost its way, approached the sun, and encountered a meteor shower. In this very critical moment, the Soviet "Motherland" risked rescuing Klarke and the others. This action of loving peace and friendship deeply moved Klarke. The film vividly illustrates that under two different social systems, there are two different purposes for scientific research. As Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, pointed out in a recent issue of the "Bulletin of the Soviet Academy of Sciences": "Soviet rockets are a powerful tool for exploring the universe, and they will never be used to do things that harm mankind. Socialist countries use the possibilities of unlimited human wisdom only for peaceful purposes, to benefit all people." Therefore, the Soviet scientists in the film still believe that on the road to the universe, the two sides should not be rivals competing with each other, but should cooperate closely. Only by peacefully utilizing the latest achievements of science and technology can human happiness be greatly increased. However, Western capitalists have expanded their adventure playground to the stars, and even the date of the宇宙飞船 spaceship's launch is determined by the stock market.

The enthusiasm and selfless attitude of Soviet scientists who always think of others, I think, not only moved Wirst and Klarke in the film, but also should have moved the conscientious people in the Western world!

Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the founder of astronautics, once said: "The Earth is the cradle of human ideals, but mankind cannot stay on Earth forever." The sky is calling, and the infinite space of the universe is waiting for us to explore, but we are still only scouts of the universe. However, judging from the speed of Soviet rocket technology development, humans landing on the moon, Mars, and Venus will be a matter of this century. Future voyages will not encounter new countries or new continents, but new planetary worlds. Go ahead, the sky is calling, the universe belongs to us!

    伟大的理想
    ——看苏联科学幻想片“天空在召唤”
    席泽宗
    汉代的著作“淮南子”里有嫦娥奔月的故事，唐朝遗留下来的敦煌石窟中有“飞天”的壁画。几千年来，人们就想着能飞到别的星球上去看看。但是，这些都只是神话和幻想。惟有在原子能时代的今天，在社会主义的苏联，才能把这些幻想变成科学的现实。从1957年到1958年，不到两年中间，苏联成功地发射了三个人造地球卫星，一个比一个大，一个比一个高。今年一年又放射了三个宇宙火箭：头一个变成了太阳系的第一个人造行星；第二个准确地命中了月球；第三个更是绕到月球背面，在离地球四十七万公里远的地方，拍下了有史以来第一张月球“看不见面”的照片，照片传到地球上来又是那样清晰，揭开了一个千古不解的哑谜。原来月球背我们的一面和向我们的一面，在形态上有所不同：背面的高山多于平原凹地，山不仅多而且高，那里有一条苏维埃山系长达二千公里；有一个宽三百公里的大海，这就是莫斯科海，它南面的海湾就是宇宙航行家湾。宇宙航行家飞往月球、火星和金星上去的计划，已经提到日程上来了。最近放映的苏联彩色故事幻想片“天空在召唤”，就是叙述苏联科学家开辟通往火星的道路的故事。故事本身虽然是幻想，却具有很大的现实可能性，因为影片中出现的星际交通站等东西，目前都已是基本上解决了的问题。
    影片描写苏联“祖国号”宇宙飞船，停落在旋转在几万公里高空的苏联星际交通站上。正当站长杰穆琴柯和飞往火星去的科尔涅夫一道研究航线时，西方国家的记者维尔斯特和准备乘飞船飞往火星去的星际旅行家克拉尔克向他要求，希望利用苏联的星际交通站，作为飞往火星去的中途站。杰穆琴柯答应了他们的要求，并接待了他们。但是当驱使科学家为他们卖命的资本家晓得了苏联“祖国号”宇宙飞船也要飞往火星时，就临时改变计划，不顾人的生命危险，命令他们立即起飞。起飞后的“台风号”迷失了方向，走到太阳附近，又遇着流星雨的袭击。在这十分危急的时候，苏联“祖国号”冒险抢救了克拉尔克他们，这种热爱和平和友谊的行动深深感动了克拉尔克。影片形象地说明了在两种不同的社会制度，有着两种不同的科学研究目的。正如苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫在最近一期“苏联科学院通报”上所指出的：“苏联火箭是研究宇宙的强大工具，它决不会被用来作出危害人类的事。社会主义国家利用人类无限智慧的可能性只是为了和平的目的，造福全体人民”。因此影片中苏联科学家们还是认为在通往宇宙的道路上，双方不应该是互相竞争的对手，而应该密切合作。只有和平利用科学技术的最新成就，才能大大增进人类的幸福。而西方资本家们却把他们的冒险乐园扩大到了星际，连宇宙飞船起飞的日期，也要由股票的行情来决定。
    苏联科学家处处为别人着想的热情、大公无私的态度，我想不仅使电影中的维尔斯特和克拉尔克受到感动，恐怕连西方世界的有良心的人们都应该有所感动吧！
    星际航行学的奠基者齐奥尔科夫斯基曾说：“地球是人类理想的摇篮，但人类不能永远停留在地球上”。天空在召唤，无限的宇宙空间等待着我们去开拓，然而我们现在还只是宇宙的侦察员。但是从苏联火箭技术发展的速度来看，人类登上月球、火星、金星将会是本世纪以内的事。未来的航行所遇到的将不是新的国家、新的大陆，而是新的星球世界。前进吧，天空在召唤，宇宙是属于我们的！
