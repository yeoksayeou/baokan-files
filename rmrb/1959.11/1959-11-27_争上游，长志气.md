    Strive to be Ahead, Cultivate Ambition
    Zhou Jinyin, Shanghai Shipbuilding and Repair Factory
    Our factory has three advanced collectives and ten advanced producers attending the Shanghai Municipal Congress of Heroes, including three comrades from our hull workshop. Everyone is very happy, and I am equally proud that my comrades have received this honor. At the beginning of the evaluation, some comrades excitedly said to me: "Little Zhou, if you become an advanced producer this time, don't forget to treat us to candy!" At that time, I thought, being on the honor roll is certainly a happy thing, but how much have I done during the Great Leap Forward? How much effort have I put into the cause of socialist construction? Compared with our advanced producers, I am indeed far behind!
    As a result of the evaluation, I was not selected. However, I was not discouraged at all. On the contrary, I used the evaluation criteria as a mirror to examine my shortcomings. Listening to the opinions of my comrades helped me find the direction to work towards. I thought: The purpose of the evaluation is to establish models, promote mutual learning, and make progress together, so as to better strive to complete the national plan. If it is for personal honor or personal competition, then the evaluation loses its great significance. Discouragement after not being selected is also the result of individualism.
    When I think of the great responsibility of our working class in socialist construction, I realize that not only do we need advanced producers to take the lead, but we especially need the broad masses of workers to rise up and strive to catch up with and surpass the level of advanced producers. At this time, I feel full of energy. Although I was not selected this time, I am confident in continuing to strive. Striving is not for personal "fame" or personal "honor," but to strive for "upstream." Strive for good labor, great contributions, and strive to learn from advanced producers quickly. This requires always listening to the Party, always maintaining soaring revolutionary enthusiasm and vigorous revolutionary will, actively participating in socialist labor competitions, humbly learning from advanced comrades, and striving to improve oneself to an advanced level. To strive for advancement, it is very important to cultivate ambition. We must cultivate the ambition to work hard and build the country with diligence and thrift, the ambition to dedicate all our energy to socialism and communism, and the ambition to serve the people with a lifetime of effort!

    争上游，长志气
    上海船舶修造厂　周金银
    我们厂有三个先进集体和十个先进生产者出席上海市的群英会议，其中有我们船体车间的三个同志。大伙儿很高兴，我也同样为自己的同伴带上了光荣花而感到自豪。在开始评比时，有同志曾兴冲冲地对我说：“小周，这回你若当上了先进生产者，可别忘了请我们吃糖呵！”当时我想，能登上光荣榜，当然是件喜事，可是我在大跃进中做了多少事呢？我为社会主义建设事业又出了多少力呢？同我们的先进生产者比起来，确实还差得很远哩！
    评选结果，我落选了。然而我却一点也没有灰心泄气。相反地，我用评选标准当作一面镜子，检查我的不足。听取了同志们的意见，更使我找到了努力方向。我想：评比是为了树立标兵，促进互相学习，共同跃进，更好地为完成国家计划而努力。如果是为了个人荣誉，个人争先进，那就失去了评比的重大意义。评不上就泄气，同样是个人主义思想在作祟。
    当我一想到我们工人阶级在社会主义建设中的重大责任，就想到不仅需要先进生产者带头前进，尤其需要广大职工群众奋起直追，努力使自己赶上并超过先进生产者的水平。这时，我就觉得浑身是劲。这次我虽然未被评上，但有信心继续争取。争，不是争个人“名气”，争个人的“荣誉”，而是力争“上游”。争劳动好，贡献大，争向先进生产者学习得快。这就要永远听党的话，永远保持冲天的革命干劲和旺盛的革命意志，积极投入社会主义的劳动竞赛，虚心向先进的同志学习，努力把自己提高到先进的水平上来。要争取先进，长志气是很重要的。我们要长艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的志气，要长把全部精力献给社会主义和共产主义的志气，要长以毕生精力为人民服务的志气！
