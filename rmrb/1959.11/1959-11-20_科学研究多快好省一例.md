An Example of Achieving More, Faster, Better, and More Economically in Scientific Research
Jin Wen

Scientific research, especially scientific research that directly serves production, will achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results by connecting with production realities, following the mass line, and widely absorbing the wisdom of the masses. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the practical experience of many scientific workers has repeatedly proven this truth. The successful trial-manufacture of an animal-powered combined cultivator, weeder, fertilizer applicator, soil hiller, and seeder by Chen Runfang, a young teacher in the Agricultural Machinery Department of Huazhong Agricultural College, together with students, workers, and farmers, is another extremely vivid example.

Connecting with production realities and following the mass line is a well-known saying, but in practice, some people still take other paths. The reason is that the method familiar to scientific workers in the past, "coming from the literature and going to the literature," still has a profound influence on many people. Chen Runfang's example also illustrates this point. The scientific research task Chen Runfang accepted was to manufacture a farm tool that could replace manual operation of four types of work. This is a topic closely related to current agricultural production. Under these circumstances, Chen Runfang should have connected with production realities and consulted with people familiar with those four types of agricultural work. However, after accepting the task, Chen Runfang thought about it and still only thought of doing it according to the old methods of scientific research, going to the literature. It wasn't until he had searched through all the materials, both Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern, and found no similar farm tool in his imagination, that he began to doubt his own approach and accepted the advice of the Party branch to go to the reality of production to find a solution. This tortuous process is very meaningful and worthy of deep thought by scientific workers. Chen Runfang is young and only started doing scientific research work in April of this year. It should be said that he is the least familiar with the old set of scientific research methods. However, he was so accustomed to the old set of scientific research methods, and so unaccustomed to connecting with production realities and following the mass line. It can be imagined that those with more experience than Chen Runfang in doing scientific research work using the old methods, especially those who have achieved some success using the old methods, are likely to be even more unaccustomed to connecting with production realities and following the mass line than Chen Runfang.

Although young teacher Chen Runfang took a detour, he corrected his course quickly, and soon achieved the major success of manufacturing an animal-powered combined cultivator, weeder, fertilizer applicator, soil hiller, and seeder, which is exciting. If scientific workers who are still accustomed to using the old methods could all resolutely transform themselves like Chen Runfang, earnestly take the path of connecting with production realities, be good at gathering collective wisdom, and take fewer detours or no detours at all, then there will surely be more fruitful results achieved in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way on the scientific front.

    科学研究多快好省一例
    金文
    科学研究、特别是直接为生产服务的科学研究，联系生产实际、走群众路线，广泛吸收群众智慧，就会收到多快好省的效果。去年大跃进以来，许多科学工作者的实践经验，对这一真理一再作了证明。华中农学院农业机械系青年教师陈润芳同学生、工人、农民一起试制畜力中耕、除草、施肥、培土、播种联合器成功，又是一个极为生动的例子。
    联系生产实际，走群众路线，这是一句尽人皆知的话，可是实践起来，仍然有人走另外的道路。原因是，以往科学工作者们熟悉的“从文献中来，到文献中去”的办法，还对许多人发生着深刻的影响。陈润芳的事例也说明了这一点。陈润芳接受的科学研究任务，是制造一种代替人力操作四种作业的农具。这是与当前农业生产紧密联系的课题。在这种情况下，陈润芳应当是联系生产实际，同熟悉农业上那四种作业的人商量商量的。可是，陈润芳接受任务以后，想来想去，还是只想到按照科学研究的老办法做，到文献中去。他直到翻遍了中外古今的资料，没有找到想像中类似的农具，才对自己的做法产生了怀疑，并接受党支部的意见，走到生产实际中去找到了办法。这一曲折过程很有意味，值得科学工作者们深思。陈润芳是青年，是今年4月间开始做科学研究工作的，应该说是最不熟悉老一套的科学研究方法的。可是，他对老一套的科学研究方法却那样习惯，而对联系生产实际、走群众路线，却那样不习惯；可以设想，比陈润芳用老办法做科学研究工作有经验的人，特别是用老办法曾经取得一些成绩的人，对于联系生产实际、走群众路线，容易比陈润芳更为不习惯。
    青年教师陈润芳虽然走了弯路，但是扭转得快，所以很快就取得了制造畜力中耕、除草、施肥、培土、播种联合器成功的重大收获，这是令人兴奋的。如果，还习惯于用老办法的科学工作者，都像陈润芳那样，毅然转变，实实在在地走联系生产实际的路，善于集思广益，少走些弯路，或不走弯路，那就一定会使科学战线上多快好省地出现更多的硕果。
