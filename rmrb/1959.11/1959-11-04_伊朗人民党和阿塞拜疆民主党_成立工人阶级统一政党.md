    Iranian People's Party and Azerbaijan Democratic Party
    Establish United Party of the Working Class

    (Dispatch) The Iranian People's Party held its Sixth Special Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee from September 13th to 18th. The main agenda of this meeting was to establish a unified Iranian working-class party and to strengthen the unity within the Iranian People's Party.

    A communique issued by the meeting stated that the Central Committee passed the draft resolution on the establishment of a unified Iranian working-class party, which was drafted by the Central Executive Bureau and the leaders of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party.

    The Azerbaijan Democratic Party was founded in 1945. It has been leading the revolutionary movement in the Azerbaijan Province of northern Iran and has received full support from the Iranian People's Party. In order to establish a unified Iranian working-class party on the basis of Leninist principles, the leaders of the two parties held negotiations. At the end of August this year, the negotiations concluded successfully. The delegations of the two parties passed a joint resolution and a declaration on restoring the unified organization of the Iranian working-class party, agreeing that the unified Iranian working-class party would still be called the Iranian People's Party, and would uniformly lead all organizations of the working-class party throughout Iran. Within the territory of Azerbaijan Province, the organization of the Iranian People's Party will continue to use the name of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party before the next congress of the People's Party, and will maintain its own Central Committee, but it will be subordinate to the leadership of the Central Committee of the Iranian People's Party and enjoy the rights of the Provincial Committee of the Iranian People's Party.

    The communique said that the Central Committee also adopted the general policy of unifying the party, as well as a resolution aimed at enhancing the unity between the party leadership and the ordinary party members.

    伊朗人民党和阿塞拜疆民主党
    成立工人阶级统一政党
    本报讯　伊朗人民党自9月13日到18日举行了中央委员会第六次特别全体会议。这次会议主要议题是成立统一的伊朗工人阶级政党和加强伊朗人民党内部的团结。
    会议发表公报说，中央委员会通过了中央执行局和阿塞拜疆民主党领导人草拟的关于成立统一的伊朗工人阶级政党的决议草案。
    阿塞拜疆民主党成立于1945年，它一直领导着伊朗北部阿塞拜疆省的革命运动，并且受到伊朗人民党的全力支持。为了在列宁主义原则基础上成立统一的伊朗工人阶级政党，两党领导人曾举行谈判。今年8月底，谈判胜利结束。两党代表团通过了共同决议和关于恢复伊朗工人阶级政党的统一组织宣言，同意伊朗统一的工人阶级政党仍称为伊朗人民党，统一领导全伊朗工人阶级政党的所有组织。在阿塞拜疆省境内，伊朗人民党的组织在人民党下届代表大会召开之前继续用阿塞拜疆民主党的名称，并保持它自己的中央委员会，但它服从伊朗人民党中央委员会的领导，享有伊朗人民党省委员会的权利。
    公报说，中央委员会还通过了使党团结一致的总方针，以及一个目的在于增进党的领导和普通党员之间的团结的决议。
