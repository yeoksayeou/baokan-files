Editor's Note: The recently published "Academic Translations" 1959, No. 11, contains three articles on the moral issues of socialism and communism. Below are summaries of these three articles.

The Question of Communist Morality is an Important Topic of Current Research in Philosophy and Science

    The continuous growth of the working people's enthusiasm in the process of communist construction requires not only that everyone possesses professional knowledge, but also that everyone deeply understands the new relationships between people and actively participates in the struggle to establish communist moral principles.
    Reality places a task before philosophy and science in the study of ethical issues, a question: Why should moral issues be given a primary place in social life during the period of comprehensive communist construction? People participate in social production in a new way, and this is the objective foundation for the continuously growing significance of ethics as a social ideology. This is clearly demonstrated by the obligations undertaken by communist labor teams. Building the material foundation of communism also means struggling for labor with new content. Modern, highly technical production requires extensive collaboration, enhances the role of social supervision over production, and unprecedentedly strengthens the role of production collectives. On the other hand, modern production requires workers with a high level of culture, capable of working independently and proactively, and with a high sense of responsibility for their work. If people are not cultivated morally accordingly, if people do not establish a spirit of collectivism and a conscious attitude towards labor, then it is inconceivable to adopt new technologies, to combine science and production in new forms of education, to implement universal social supervision, and to flexibly organize production. At the same time, modern production places high demands on the development of individual talents, especially requiring people to practically participate in scientific and cultural activities, so it also requires people to consciously and rationally use their leisure time. In order to smoothly develop modern production, it is necessary to correctly combine material and spiritual incentives for labor. Material and spiritual incentives have a profound impact on all moral principles.
    The struggle to establish communist morality and oppose the remnants of bourgeois morality can only be victorious if the working people collectively participate, if mass opinion becomes a propagator of noble moral principles, and if ethical issues occupy a corresponding position in the entire system of our ideological work. In this work, the task of philosophy and science is first to theoretically study morality as a social ideology. It is necessary to understand that the formation of communist morality is an objective process, an aspect of the formation of new social relations. It must be pointed out that under the conditions of comprehensively developing communist construction, moral issues are a practical factor in the struggle for the all-round development of the people, without which communist production and communist public life are inconceivable.

Fundamental Characteristics of Socialist Morality

    As a social ideology, morality is necessary for maintaining the unified whole of society and class, and for educating people to respect a certain social order. Therefore, public opinion always relies on the interests of society or class, and when an individual attempts to harm this interest, his behavior is immoral and will be condemned by society. Since the unity of society (class) is always the result of more or less, forced or voluntary, restrictions on the individual, there can be no absolute moral freedom in the absolute sense, because such freedom would fundamentally eliminate morality. The question of moral freedom is largely a matter of the degree to which individual interests and social interests are adapted. The greater this degree of adaptation, the freer the individual becomes, and the less need there is to restrict oneself in front of society.
    The morality of the private owner stems first from the necessity of maintaining and consolidating private property, which is the foundation of class rule; second, from the necessity of class solidarity among private owners in the face of the oppressed masses. The nature of private ownership itself and the relations of production arising from it create antagonism between individuals, and thus also create antagonism between the individual and society. Thus, a situation arises in which the individual interests of private owners require the destruction of the moral norms of the social class. Therefore, private ownership actually produces a "double morality": one is the morality that everyone demands that others abide by but is secretly violated by everyone; the other is the morality that everyone openly condemns but becomes the actual "guide to action" for everyone. This contradiction between social demands and individual behavior, between social (class) morality and individual morality, is an inexhaustible source of all hypocrisy. And the more brutally the "sacred precepts" of the public life of private owners are violated, the louder and more pleasing to the ear the public pronouncements demanding the maintenance of "moral values" become. The victory of socialism not only guarantees the political and class unity of society, but also guarantees the unity of morality. This unity becomes the foundation of the common economic and political goals of all working people, and the foundation of their common demand for organized and concerted action for the victory of communism.
    But in socialist countries, there are still many people who want to live off society without giving anything to society. There is no doubt that the "interests" of parasites cannot be unified with the interests of socialist society; they are completely opposed, and there is an irreconcilable struggle between them.
    It is necessary to distinguish between the objective content of individual interests and the subjective intentions and desires of people. For example, if a person possesses artistic talent and therefore hopes to become an artist, here the objective content of individual interest is consistent with the individual's subjective desires, and at the same time, individual interest is unified with social interest, because society is also very concerned about the development of art and concerned about cultivating talented people to enrich the ranks of art. But if a vain old mother wants to show off her miracle in a music school, simply because she is unwilling to stand next to a machine tool, or unwilling to go to the fields, if someone wants to become an actor, musician, poet, etc., but is not made of this material, then his individual interest has no objective content, is selfish and self-interested, and therefore must be in contradiction with society. Therefore, do not simply say that the individual interest under the socialist system is unified with the social interest, but rather that the correctly understood individual interest is unified with the social interest.
    Secondly, it is necessary to distinguish between the current interests of individuals and their long-term interests, and between temporary interests and permanent interests. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union's industrialization policy was linked to the spirit of self-sacrifice on the part of the masses of the people, and to restrictions on the production and consumption of certain commodities. This means that this policy, which is necessary for the people and socialist society, in a sense, temporarily harms the direct interests of individuals and contradicts individual interests. However, if heavy industry had not been established, our country would have long become a victim of fascist robbers. In this case, the individual interests of the Soviet people would have been completely ruined, and a large proportion of the population would even have been slaughtered. Therefore, from the perspective of the future of historical development, industrialization is not only necessary for the entire society, but also necessary for everyone.
    The unity of individual interests and social interests under the socialist system does not mean that there is no contradiction between any individual interest and social interest. But socialism completely changes the nature of this contradiction, because here, the individual as an individual economic force and moral force does not contradict society, and the individual is a part of the socially united collective of labor. In other words, under the socialist system, there is a unity of social interests and the main, fixed, and correctly understood individual interests, but this does not preclude the possibility of contradictions between social interests and individual direct interests or incorrectly understood individual interests.
    Therefore, in order to make individual actions always beneficial to society, it is necessary to give people the concept and feeling of obligation and conscience, and cultivate people's moral belief that public interests are higher than individual interests. This moral sense and moral concept are most fully developed in socialist morality, because they reflect not only the objective connection between the individual and his class, but also the objective connection between the individual and the entire society, the motherland, and the people.
    The unity of individual interests and public interests, which is unique to socialist morality, is specifically manifested in such moral characteristics and principles as socialist humanism, patriotism and internationalism, and a conscious attitude towards labor and socialist property. Instilling these principles into everyone's consciousness, making them a part of everyone's inner "self," and making them a characteristic of human character is also one of the most important goals of communist education.

(Excerpt from A. Kharchev of the Soviet "Philosophical Science" magazine, No. 1, 1959: "Problems of Moral Education under the Socialist System")

Bourgeois Morality and Communist Morality

    Since Kant, bourgeois thinkers have repeatedly advocated that the primary principle of ethics is to treat people as ends, and not as means. But the basic law of capitalist development is precisely to turn the vast majority of mankind into means; for capital, wage laborers are a means, a means of production.
    From an economic point of view, the capitalist system accumulates wealth at one extreme, but accumulates poverty at the other.
    From a moral point of view, this system corrupts and degrades those who own property, and ruins those who are exploited.
    Corrupt capitalism produces corrupt bourgeois morality.
    When the value of a person is determined by his property, when the pursuit of profit becomes the law of the social system, all human relations and all feelings are destroyed: the family is an inheritance; patriotism is colonial exploitation and chauvinism; freedom is selfish individualism; humanism is a lie used to cover up and maintain the slave system.
    In an unjust war, the only morality is on the side of those who resist the war. Similarly, in a system based on the exploitation of man by man, the only way to respect humanity is to fight against the system of exploitation.
    The morality of the proletariat is produced by the class position of the proletariat; the moral value of the proletariat is not because it is the most exploited class, not because it is the most suffering class, but because its class position is: it cannot liberate itself unless it completely destroys capitalism that degrades mankind.
    It is not poverty or disaster that creates the moral value of the proletariat, but struggle.
    In every era, the rising class is the class that bears the future of mankind, it coordinates the relations of production and the productive forces, which opens up the widest world for creative work.
    In our time, this class is the working class.
    In the process of fighting for its class demands, the working class is also fighting for socialism at the same time.
    Only this struggle can provide a path for the all-round development of everyone, it makes the proletariat have an absolute moral advantage over all other classes.
    Workers cannot carry out this struggle alone: only by consciously and voluntarily participating in mass activities, participating in the united struggle of the entire class, can he achieve victory.
    Only the Party can give the working class the scientific means to achieve unity and victory.
    Only the Party has this ideal, this morality.
    This is not an individualistic morality, but a socialist morality. Aragon wrote: "The Communist is a person who hopes to get everything for mankind--yes, he hopes to get a lot of things, happiness, health, security--but he hopes for all mankind--and is willing to sacrifice his own health, happiness, security and even his own life in exchange for all this."
    The individual's morality does not conflict with the collective goals set by the Party, this is the first time in history.
    This communist ideal elevates the fate of each person to such a height that everyone can be aware of the future of mankind and be responsible for the future, this ideal is the greatest spiritual force of our time.

    建设最理想的社会　需要最崇高的道德
    编者按：最近出版的“学术译丛”1959年第11期，有三篇文章谈到社会主义和共产主义的道德问题，下面是这三篇文章的摘要
    共产主义道德问题是哲学科学当前研究的重要课题
    劳动人民积极性在共产主义建设过程中的不断增长，不仅要求每个人具有职业知识，而且要求每个人深刻理解人们之间的新关系和积极参加确立共产主义道德原则的斗争。
    现实在伦理学问题研究方面，向哲学科学提出了这样一项任务，这样一个问题：为什么全面展开共产主义建设时期要把道德问题提到社会生活中的首要地位。人们以一种新的方式参加社会生产，这是伦理学这一社会意识形态的意义不断增长的客观基础。共产主义劳动队所承担的义务清楚地表明了这一点。建立共产主义的物质基础，同时也意味着为具有新内容的劳动而斗争。现代的具有高度技术的生产要求人们进行广泛的协作，提高了对于生产的社会监督的作用，并且空前地加强了生产集体的作用。另一方面，现代生产需要具有高度文化水平、能够独立和主动地工作并且对所负工作抱有高度责任感的工人。如果不去相应地从道德上培养人，不使人们树立集体主义精神和自觉的劳动态度，那么要采用新的技术，要使新的教育形式中科学与生产相结合，要实行普遍的社会监督和灵活地组织生产，都是不可思议的。同时，现代生产又对个人才能的发展提出高度的要求，特别是要求人们实际地参加科学和文化活动，所以也要求人们自觉地和合理地利用业余时间。为了顺利地发展现代生产，必须把对劳动的物质鼓励和精神鼓励正确地结合起来。物质鼓励和精神鼓励对全部道德原则发生着深刻的影响。
    树立共产主义道德、反对资产阶级道德残余的斗争，只有在劳动人民的集体参加下，在群众的舆论成为崇高道德原则的传播者，伦理学问题在我们思想工作的整个系统中占有相应地位的情况下，才能够获得胜利。在这个工作中，哲学科学的任务首先是从理论上研究道德这一社会意识形态。必须了解共产主义道德的形成是一个客观过程，是新的社会关系形成中的一个方面。必须指明，在全面展开共产主义建设的条件下，道德问题是为人民群众全面发展而斗争的一个实际因素，没有这个因素，共产主义生产和共产主义公共生活都是不可思议的。
    （摘自苏联“哲学问题”杂志1959年第九期社论：把哲学研究提高到共产主义建设新任务的水平）
    社会主义道德的根本特征
    道德作为社会意识形态，对于维护社会和阶级这个统一的整体，对于教育人们尊重某种社会秩序来说，是必需的。因此，社会舆论始终以社会或阶级利益为依据，而在个人企图损害这种利益时，他的行为就是不道德的，并且会受到社会的指责。既然社会（阶级）的统一始终是个人或多或少、被迫或者自愿地受限制的结果，那就不可能有绝对意义的道德自由，因为这样的自由就是根本取消道德。关于道德自由问题在很大程度上是个人利益和社会利益适应的程度问题。这种适应程度越大，个人就越自由，越不需要在社会面前限制自己。
    私有者的道德，第一是从维护和巩固私有财产这种必要性出发的，这是阶级统治的基础；第二是从私有者在被压迫群众面前的阶级团结的必要性出发的。私有制的性质本身以及由于私有制而产生的生产关系造成个人同他人之间的对抗，因而也造成个人同社会的对抗。于是产生一种情况，私有者的个人利益要求破坏社会阶级的道德规范。因此，私有制实际上产生了“双重道德”：一种是每个人都要求别人遵守的而又暗中被大家破坏的道德；另一种是大家公开指责的、然而成为所有的人实际的“行动指南”的道德。这种社会要求同个人行为之间的矛盾，社会（阶级）道德和个人道德之间的矛盾，是一切伪善的无尽的源泉。而私有者公共生活的“神圣戒律”越受到粗暴的侵犯，则要求维护“道德价值”的公开言论也叫得越响亮，越动听。社会主义的胜利不仅保证社会的政治和阶级的统一，也保证道德的统一。这种统一成为全体劳动人民共同的经济目的和政治目的的基础，成为他们为共产主义的胜利而有组织地一致行动这一共同要求的基础。
    但是在社会主义国家里，还有不少人想依靠社会过日子，而不给社会任何东西。毫无疑义，寄生者的“利益”同社会主义社会的利益是不能统一起来的，它们是完全对立的，它们之间有着不可调和的斗争。
    必须把个人利益的客观内容同人的主观意图和愿望区别开来。比方说，如果一个人拥有艺术才能，因此希望成为艺术家，这里个人利益的客观内容同个人主观愿望是一致的，同时，个人利益同社会利益是统一的，因为社会也非常关心艺术的发展，关心培养有才能的人来充实艺术队伍。但是如果好虚荣的老妈妈要在音乐学校里显显自己的奇迹，只不过是因为不愿意站在机床旁边，或者不愿意到地里去，如果有人想要成为演员、音乐家、诗人等等，而又不是这块材料，那么他的个人利益是没有客观内容的，是自私自利的，因此必然是同社会矛盾的。因此，不要简单地说社会主义制度下个人利益同社会利益的统一，而是正确理解的个人利益同社会利益的统一。
    其次，必须把个人的目前利益同长远利益区别开来，把一时的利益同永久的利益区别开来。大家知道，苏联的工业化政策是同人民群众方面的自我牺牲精神，同某些商品的生产方面和消费方面的限制相联系。这就是说，这种为人民和社会主义社会所必需的政策，从某种意义上来说，暂时会损害个人的直接利益，同个人利益发生矛盾。但是，如果不建立重工业的话，我们的国家就早已成为法西斯强盗的牺牲品了。而在这种情况下，苏联人民的个人利益就完全被断送了，很大一部分居民甚至被屠杀了。因此，从历史发展前途来看，工业化不但对整个社会来说是必需的，对于每个人来说也是必需的。
    社会主义制度下个人利益同社会利益的统一绝不意味着任何个人利益同社会利益没有矛盾。但是社会主义彻底改变了这种矛盾的性质，因为在这里，个人作为个别的个体的经济力量和道德力量同社会并不矛盾，个人是统一劳动的社会集体中的一部分。换句话说，社会主义制度下存在着社会利益同主要的、固定的、正确理解的个人利益的统一，但是这并不排斥社会利益同个人直接利益或不正确理解的个人利益之间发生矛盾的可能性。
    因此，为了使个人的行动始终有利于社会，必须使人们具有义务和良心的概念和感觉，培养人们对于公共利益高于个人利益的道德信念。这种道德感和道德概念在社会主义道德中得到最充分的发展，因为它们所反映的不但是个人同自己的阶级的客观联系，而且还有个人同整个社会、祖国、人民的客观联系。
    社会主义道德所特有的个人利益和公共利益的统一具体表现为这样一些道德特征和原则，如社会主义人道主义、爱国主义和国际主义、自觉地对待劳动和社会主义财产。把这些原则灌输到每个人的意识中去，使之成为每个人的内心的“我”的一部分，成为人的性格特征，这也是共产主义教育的一个最重要的目的。
    （摘自苏联“哲学科学”杂志1959年第一期阿·哈尔切夫：“社会主义制度下的道德教育问题”）
    资产阶级道德和共产主义道德
    自从康德以来，资产阶级思想家一再鼓吹伦理学的首要原则是要把人当作目的看待，而不应把人当作手段看待。但资本主义发展的基本规律正是使人类中的极大多数变成了手段；对资本来说，工资劳动者就是一种手段，一种生产手段。
    从经济的观点来看，资本主义制度在一个极端积累财富，但在另一个极端积累贫困。
    从道德的观点来看，这种制度使拥有财产的人腐化堕落，而使受剥削的人家破人亡。
    腐朽的资本主义产生了腐朽的资产阶级道德。
    当人的价值是用他的财产来确定的时候，当追求利润成为社会制度的规律的时候，人类的一切关系和一切感情就都被破坏了：家庭就是遗产；爱国主义就是殖民地剥削和沙文主义；自由就是自私自利的个人主义；人道主义就是用来掩饰并维持奴隶制度的谎言。
    在一个非正义的战争中，唯一的道德是在反抗战争的人那一边。同样，在一个以人剥削人为基础的制度里，唯一尊重人类的方法就是向剥削制度进行斗争。
    无产阶级的道德是由无产阶级的阶级立场产生的；无产阶级的道德价值不是由于它是最受剥削的阶级、不是因为它是受苦难最多的阶级，而是因为它的阶级立场是：如果不把使人类堕落的资本主义完全毁灭掉，它就不能解放自己。
    造成无产阶级的道德价值的不是贫穷或灾难，而是斗争。
    在每一个时代，上升的阶级就是肩负着人类未来的阶级，它把生产关系和生产力协调起来，这就给创造性工作开辟了最广阔的天地。
    在我们的时代里，这个阶级就是工人阶级。
    工人阶级在为它的阶级要求而斗争的过程中，同时它也在为社会主义而斗争。
    唯有这种斗争能给每个人提供全面发展的途径，它使无产阶级具有超越其他一切阶级的绝对的道德优势。
    工人不能单独地进行这种斗争：只有自觉地、自愿地参加群众活动，参加整个阶级的联合斗争，他才能取得胜利。
    只有党能把实现团结和取得胜利的科学手段给予工人阶级。
    只有党有这种理想、这种道德。
    这不是一种个人主义道德，而是社会主义道德。阿拉贡写道：“共产党人是希望使人类得到一切东西的人——是的，他希望得到很多的东西，幸福、健康、安全——但他是为全人类而希望——而且是情愿牺牲自己的健康、幸福、安全甚至自己的生命来换取这一切。”
    个人的道德和党所规定的集体目标不发生矛盾，这在历史上是破天荒第一次出现的。
    这种共产主义理想把每个人的命运提到这样的高度，使每个人都能意识到人类的未来并对未来负起责任，这种理想是我们时代的最伟大的精神力量。
