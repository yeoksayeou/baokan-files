A peculiar "Underground Factory"
A Soviet Kuzbass Underground Coal Gasification Station

For hundreds of years, humanity has been mining coal, but coal mining has always been one of the most arduous tasks. Although the coal mining industry has gradually advanced towards mechanization in recent years, underground labor is still more difficult than other types of labor.

Finding new, economical, and labor-saving ways to utilize coal's thermal energy is a problem that many scientists and technologists are dedicated to exploring. As early as the end of the 19th century, the great Russian chemist Mendeleev observed that people extracted coal from the ground and then burned it to release thermal energy. He wondered, wouldn't it be both economical and simple if coal could be burned underground and the thermal energy extracted and utilized? In 1899, this great scientist made the following prediction: "The time may come when coal is no longer mined from underground, but is converted into combustible gas right there, and transmitted far away through pipelines." Later, he even pointed out some specific methods for coal gasification. The British chemist William Ramsay also invented the same method, which Lenin once called "a great technological victory."

In the Soviet Union, this new method of underground coal gasification plants has been used in the coal industry for more than 20 years. Recently, when the reporter was interviewing in Kuzbass, he had the opportunity to visit the South Abinsk underground coal gasification station near Kiselevsk. We first visited a three-dimensional model of the coal gasification station, which was a large box made of glass panels. The above-ground buildings only occupy a thin layer. Most of the model is underground, so some people call this kind of coal gasification station an "underground factory." After the lights in the model were turned on, we saw layers of strata composed of various rocks on the side glass panel. The bottom layer was the coalfield. The chief engineer of the gasification station told us that this coalfield was 150 meters from the surface and had a thickness of 2 to 9 meters. The nearby coal reserves were very rich and all were brown coal. On this glass panel, we saw five or six tunnels leading to the coal seam, which were specially designed to supply high-pressure air to the coal seam. On the other side of the glass panel, we saw two pipelines sloping from the ground to the coal seam. The chief engineer told us that the lower one was the ventilation pipe, and the upper one was the outlet for the gas after coal gasification. There was a burning area in the black coal seam. The chief engineer joked, "Now we are standing on top of this burning coal seam, but you don't have to worry, our feet won't get burned. All the buildings on the gasification station are not affected in the slightest."

We asked him how this underground fire was "ignited" and how it was controlled after it was ignited. He replied that in order to make the underground coal burn, the two pipelines leading to the coal seam must first be connected underground. Currently, this work is done by a special drilling rig (previously, someone had to go down to the coal seam to connect them). Then, red-hot coal blocks are sent from the first pipeline to the coal seam, and high-pressure air is introduced into the second pipeline. In this way, the coal seam begins to burn, and the gas generated rises to the surface along the side outlet pipeline. The temperature of the coal seam combustion reaches about 1,300 degrees Celsius. According to statistics, one kilogram of coal can generate four cubic meters of gas, and each cubic meter of gas can generate 1,100 kilocalories of heat after burning.

The chief engineer of the gasification station told us that the current gasification station produces 130 million cubic meters of gas annually, which is used by five factories in Kiselevsk. In seven years, it will produce 2.3 billion cubic meters annually, which is 15 times more than now. We asked him what the advantages of the underground coal gasification station are. He replied: "The basic advantages of coal gasification are three: first, it eliminates the underground coal mining work, and therefore eliminates all the expenses incurred by mining; second, gas can be transported by pipeline, and the transportation cost is much lower than that of coal; third, the thermal energy utilization rate of gas is higher than that of coal, and it does not emit smoke or pollute the air. After coal gasification, many by-products can also be extracted."

Then, the chief engineer led us to visit the above-ground buildings of the gasification station. It is basically divided into four parts: the drilling and pipeline section, the air compression workshop, the gas outlet workshop, and the gas filtration workshop. Some by-products can also be produced during gas filtration. In order to utilize these by-products, a special workshop will also be built on the gasification station. In the drilling and pipeline section, we saw sealed steel pipes extending underground. The high-pressure air from the air compression workshop flows through these pipes to the coal seam, where it ignites a huge fire. In the gas outlet workshop, we saw the instruments on the gas pipeline indicating the amount of gas produced per hour. According to the chief engineer, the gasification station now produces 30,000 cubic meters of gas per hour, and by next year it will produce more than 70,000 cubic meters per hour. The gasification station burns about 100 tons of coal underground every day.

The chief engineer finally told us that the coal gasification station is an undertaking with broad prospects. Although it has just entered the industrial production stage, its advantages have been preliminarily demonstrated. Some problems can definitely be solved smoothly after research. At that time, the underground coal gasification station will achieve greater development.

    奇异的“地下工厂”
    苏联库兹巴斯一个地下煤炭气化站
    人类采煤的历史已经有了几百年，但是采煤的劳动一直是最繁重的劳动之一，尽管近年来采煤工业逐渐向机械化前进，但是地下的劳动毕竟还比其他劳动繁重一些。
    设法用新的经济而省力的途径利用煤炭热能，是许多科学技术家致力探讨的问题。早在十九世纪末，俄罗斯大化学家门得列也夫看到，人们把煤炭从地下开采出来，然后使之燃烧，放出热能。他想，如果使煤炭能在地下燃烧，又能把热能从地底取出来加以利用，这样岂不又经济又简便？！在1899年，这位伟大科学家作出了这样的预言：“将来可能出现这样一个时代，那时煤炭不再从地底下挖出来，而就在地下把它变成可以燃烧的气体，并且用管道把它传到远方去。”后来他甚至指出了煤炭气化的一些具体方法。英国化学家威廉·拉姆赛也发明了同样方法，列宁曾经把这个方法称为“一个伟大的技术胜利”。
    在苏联，煤炭工业方面采用这种新方法，即建立地下煤炭气化站，已有二十多年的历史。不久前，当记者在库兹巴斯采访时，有机会参观了基赛辽夫斯克市附近的南阿宾斯克地下煤炭气化站。我们首先参观了煤炭气化站的立体模型，这是一个用玻璃板制成的大箱子，地面的建筑只占了薄薄的一层，模型上的大部分全在地下，所以有人管这种煤炭气化站叫作“地下工厂”。模型中的电灯亮了以后，在侧面的玻璃板上我们看到了由各种不同岩石组成的地层，在靠底下的一层是煤田，气化站总工程师告诉我们说，这块煤田距地面一百五十米，厚度在二至九米之间，附近煤的蕴藏量非常丰富，全是褐煤。在这块玻璃板上，我们看到了五六条通向煤层的洞道，这是专门向煤层通高压空气的。在另一面的玻璃板上我们看到了两条由地面倾斜着通向煤层的管道，总工程师告诉我们说，下面一条是通风管，上面那一条则是煤炭气化后瓦斯的出口。黑色的煤层中有一块地方正在燃烧，总工程师开着玩笑说：“现在我们就站在这块燃烧着的煤层上面，但是可以不必担心，我们的脚不会被烫着。气化站上的一切建筑不受丝毫影响。”
    我们问他这个地下火是怎样“生”起来的，生起来以后又怎样控制？他回答说，为了使地下的煤炭燃烧起来，先要把两个通向煤层的管道在底下打通，目前这个工作由专门的钻采机来完成（以前是要有人下到煤层中去打通的）。然后把烧得红灼的煤块从第一个管道送到煤层中去，同时在第二个管道开始通高压空气，这样煤层就开始燃烧起来，瓦斯生成后便沿着侧面的出口管道冒出地面，煤层燃烧的温度达到摄氏一千三百多度左右。据统计，一公斤的煤可以生成四立方米的瓦斯，每一立方米的瓦斯燃烧后可发热一千一百基罗卡路里。
    气化站的总工程师告诉我们说，目前这个气化站每年生产煤气一亿三千万立方米，供基赛辽夫斯克市五家工厂之用。七年后每年将生产二十三亿立方米，比现在要增加十五倍。我们问他地下煤炭气化站有什么优点？他回答说：“煤炭气化的基本优点有三个：首先是取消了地下采煤的工作，因而也就取消了因为开矿而用的一切开支，第二是瓦斯可以用管道传送，运输费用比煤炭节省了很多，第三是瓦斯的热能利用率比煤炭高，同时却不冒烟，不会使空气污浊，煤炭气化后还可以提炼出许多副产品。
    然后，总工程师领着我们参观了气化站的地面建筑。它基本分成四个部分：即钻井管道工段、空气压缩车间、瓦斯出口车间和瓦斯过滤车间。在瓦斯过滤时还可以生产一些副产品，为了利用这些副产品，气化站上还将建设一个专门车间。在钻井管道工段，我们看见一个个密封的钢管伸向地下，来自空气压缩车间的高压空气便从这里顺向煤层，而在那里烧起巨火。在瓦斯出口车间，我们看到瓦斯管上的仪表指着每小时瓦斯生产的数量，据总工程师说，现在气化站每小时生产瓦斯三万立方米，到明年时每小时将生产七万立方米以上。气化站每天在地下烧煤一百吨左右。
    这位总工程师最后告诉我们说，煤炭气化站是一项有着广泛前途的事业，虽然它刚刚进入工业生产阶段，但是它的优越性已经初步显示出来了，有些问题经过研究后一定可以顺利解决，那时地下煤炭气化站将获得更大的发展。
