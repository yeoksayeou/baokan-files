Chongqing, November 6th (By our own correspondent) A labor emulation drive, where everyone strives to be the best, each competes for high production, slow hands catch up to fast hands, and fast hands catch up to skilled hands, to become red banner pacesetters, is unfolding in depth among the young textile workers of Chongqing. In just over a month, 50% of the slow hands among the city's young textile workers have rapidly reached the operational level of fast hands. The number of skilled workers in each factory has also increased dramatically from 5% to 10% to 20%.

After the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced, Chongqing textile workers immediately plunged into a production upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy. Textile factories have greatly accelerated their machinery and proposed to spin low-grade raw materials into high-quality products. This requires workers to have higher operational skills and to transform slow hands into fast hands and skilled hands to meet the production needs after the speed increase.

This competition among young textile workers in Chongqing, where slow hands catch up to fast hands, fast hands catch up to skilled hands, and they strive to be red banner pacesetters, is based on dividing each worker's operational skill level (including output, quality, and raw material consumption level) into slow hands, fast hands, and skilled hands, and then organizing the advanced to lead the backward, and the backward to catch up to the advanced. The competition has the following three main forms: The first is to organize shock teams of slow hands to catch up with skilled hands, with skilled hands or fast hands serving as captains. The captain spends a certain amount of time each day understanding the difficulties and problems existing among the slow hands, exchanging operational techniques according to the needs of the slow hands, or organizing visits to learn from the operational experience of other advanced workers. The second is the doubles competition. A skilled hand (or fast hand) and a slow hand form a pair and compete against another pair. The main content of their competition is to compare who produces better, who helps each other better, and who helps the slow hands better. The third is to organize individual matches between fast hands and slow hands, and skilled hands and slow hands, competing and helping each other at the same time. These advanced methods of helping the backward have rapidly and effectively improved the production skills of the slow hands. A roving yarn doffing group in the fine spinning workshop of the South Textile Mill of the 610 Textile Dyeing Factory were originally all slow hands. After forming a catching-up shock team, the skilled roving doffer spent half an hour after work every day explaining and demonstrating. As a result, the average number of yarn joins per minute for the entire group increased to two, and the time to doff twelve spindles decreased from forty-five minutes to fifteen minutes. Two of the eight members of the group reached the level of skilled workers, and six reached the level of fast hands.

The development of this competition activity has not only enabled backward workers to catch up with the advanced, but also promoted the advanced to become even more advanced. In just over a month since the Chongqing Silk Spinning Factory launched this competition, the number of fast hands catching up with skilled hands has increased by one and a half times compared to the original, and the number of young red banner pacesetters has increased from a few to forty-four.

    重庆青年纺织工人
    慢手赶快手  快手赶能手
    半数慢手达到快手水平生产能手增加一倍
    本报重庆6日电　一个人人争上游，个个夺高产的慢手赶快手，快手赶能手，争当红旗手的劳动竞赛正在重庆市青年纺织工人中深入展开。一个多月来，全市青年纺织工人中，已有50％的慢手迅速达到了快手的操作水平；各厂的能手也由5％到10％猛增至20％。
    党的八届八中全会决议公布后，重庆纺织工人立即投入了增产节约的生产热潮，纺织厂都大大地加快了车速，并提出要把低级原料纺织成优质产品。这样，就要求工人们有更高的操作技术，要求把慢手变成快手、能手，以适应车速加快后的生产需要。
    重庆市青年纺织工人中的这种慢手赶快手、快手赶能手、争当红旗手的竞赛，是按照每个工人的操作技术水平（包括产量、质量和原材料消耗水平）划分为慢手、快手和能手，然后组织先进带后进，后进赶先进的竞赛。竞赛有以下三种主要形式：第一种是组织慢手猛追能手的突击队，由能手或快手担任队长。队长每天抽一定时间了解慢手中存在的困难和问题，针对慢手的需要交流操作技术，或组织参观学习其他先进工人的操作经验；第二种是双打竞赛。由一个能手（或快手）和一个慢手组成一对，与另一对展开对手赛。他们竞赛的主要内容，是比生产好，比互助好，比帮助慢手好；第三种是组织快手对慢手，能手对慢手的个人对手赛，一面竞赛，一面帮助。这些先进帮助落后的竞赛方法，迅速有效地提高了慢手的生产技术水平。六一零纺织染厂南纺场细纱车间一个学工落纱小组，原来全部都是慢手，组成追赶突击队后，熟练的落纱长每天下班后抽出半小时边讲边表演，结果，全组每人每分钟的接头数，平均提高到两根，落十二台纱的时间由四十五分钟降低到一刻钟。全组八人中有两人达到了能手水平，六人达到快手水平。
    开展这项竞赛活动后，不仅使落后的工人赶上了先进，而且促使先进的更先进了。重庆丝纺厂开展这项竞赛活动只一个多月，快手赶上能手的人数就比原来增加了一倍半，青年红旗手由几个增加到了四十四个。
