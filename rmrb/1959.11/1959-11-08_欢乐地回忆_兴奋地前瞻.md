　　Last year, on the eve of the anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, I was in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union.

　　After the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Writers' Conference returned home, before the Chinese Labor People's Observation Group arrived, I lived alone on the twentieth floor of the Ukraine Hotel in Moscow, spending ten days of "recuperation."

　　Every morning, I would get up early and stand in front of the wide, bright window, gazing at the early winter scenery outside.

　　In the misty haze, the Moscow River flowed slowly, and countless vehicles, large and small, began to move along the towering buildings and wide streets. To the right was a residential building that was not yet completed. Two cranes with long, giant arms slowly and accurately transported building materials to the top of the building. Several workers, treading on the thin snow, were running around installing them. Beside the avenue in front of the building, there was a bus stop. Every few minutes, people going to work would line up in long queues. Among them were also children jumping, laughing, and constantly breathing on their hands. A bus filled with people slowly drove away, and a second one came, carrying a continuous stream of warm and neatly dressed people engaged in peaceful labor to their work posts.

　　By the time I came back from breakfast downstairs, the streets outside the window were relatively quiet. I would begin to write in my diary, write letters, or read the newspaper in the spring-like warmth of the room.

　　In the evening, all the lights were on, and the neat rows of lights outlined the contours of a great modern city. The most beautiful sight was the Moscow University building on Lenin Hills in the distance, faintly highlighted by the twilight, which, under the intense glare of the mercury lamps, looked like it was made of crystal bricks, so exquisite and dazzling. The Ukraine Hotel's floors were also illuminated by mercury lamps, and the light shone into my window, like the silvery moonlight of a full autumn moon. At this time, I would often turn off the lights and sit in front of the window, lost in thought.

　　How different the entire atmosphere of this city was from the many modern big cities I had visited in Europe and America! Here was solemnity, tranquility, and serenity. Every tree, every railing, every window seemed to emit the light of peace and happiness. In the big cities of capitalist countries, at this time, although the lights were as bright as day and the traffic was heavy, what the lights illuminated were noble gentlemen and ladies sitting in exquisite limousines, and unemployed masses wandering on the sidewalks, staring blankly at the colorful shop windows with hungry and thirsty eyes. Beneath the continuous flow of traffic and people, there was a churning of competition, devouring, oppression, and exploitation… In theaters and restaurants of decadent indulgence, decadent stories were performed, and lewd music was broadcasted. The flashing neon lights at the entrance of large newspaper offices reported murders, robberies, and slanderous instigations in a ghastly green light…

　　And the boiling of Moscow was a joyful boiling, an excited boiling! On the forty-first anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, after the draft of the Seven-Year Plan was announced, a new, more beautiful, and greater blueprint for communist construction was unfolded before hundreds of millions of people. The hearts of hundreds of millions of people, like flowers blooming all at once under the warm spring sun, radiated light in all directions! In every building and every corner, one could hear joyful and excited discussions. Voluntary labor teams sprouted up like mushrooms after the rain. The results of the Soviet people's political and labor enthusiasm, creative passion, and unprecedentedly high communist consciousness this past year, as Comrade Khrushchev said, "bring us joyful news of the new victories of the Soviet people every day." Aren't we also excitedly watching the news of the Soviet people's new victories every day when we read the newspapers in Beijing? When we read that the Soviet Union successfully launched three cosmic rockets in a row in 1959, weren't we celebrating and rejoicing together with the Soviet people and with peace-loving people all over the world?

　　The October Socialist Revolution was a turning point in human history. From then on, a socialist system of the world was opened up on Earth. The people in this world were liberated from the system of man exploiting man. Their collective strength and wisdom turned to building a beautiful and happy future. With the continuous development of science and culture, people's ideal realm is expanding, improving, moving further, and becoming more beautiful day by day. The ideals of the people within the socialist system are no longer limited to a peaceful and united Earth, but a peaceful and united universe!

　　The outstanding scientific achievements of Soviet scientists and working people in exploring the secrets of the universe outside the Earth have caused a surge in the tide of peace on five continents and four seas, leaving those war-mongers huddled on the peaks of war islands to cry their eyes out. Let us, together with peace-loving people all over the world, sing loudly in the voices celebrating the forty-second anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution: Long live the October Socialist Revolution! Long live the great unity of the people of the world! Long live peace!

    欢乐地回忆　兴奋地前瞻
    冰心
    去年的十月社会主义革命纪念的前夕，我正在苏联的首都莫斯科。
    在参加亚非作家会议的中国代表团回国之后，中国劳动人民观礼团来到以前，我自己住在莫斯科的乌克兰旅馆的第二十层楼上，过了十天的“休养”生活。
    每天早起，我站在宽大明亮的窗前，望着窗外的初冬景色。
    在蒙蒙的薄雾里，莫斯科的河水缓缓地在流，高耸的楼边，宽阔的街上，数不清的大小车辆，也开始在流动。右边是一座还未完工的住宅大楼，两架伸着长长的巨臂的起重机，慢慢地准确地向楼顶上运送着建筑器材，楼顶有几个工人，踏着薄雪，在奔走安装。楼前的大道旁，有一处汽车站，每隔几分钟，上班上工的人们就排列成长长的队伍，其中也有跳着笑着向着两手不住的呵气的孩子。一辆车坐满了人，慢慢地开走了，第二辆又来了，就这样川流不息地，把穿戴得温暖而整齐的，做着和平劳动的人们，送上他们工作的岗位。
    等到我下楼吃完早饭回来，窗外街上就比较静了。我就开始在温暖如春的屋子里，写日记，写信或是阅报。
    到了晚上，灯火齐明，齐整的一行行的灯光，照出了一座伟大的近代城市的轮廓，最美的是远远的，淡淡的暮霭烘托着的列宁山上莫斯科大学的高楼，在强烈的水银灯逼射之下，就像是水晶砖砌成的一般，那样玲珑夺目。乌克兰旅馆的层楼，也有水银灯映照着，这灯光射到我的窗内，就好像秋天的满月银光一样，这时我往往捻灭了灯，坐在窗前凝想。
    这城市的整个气氛，和我所走过的欧美的许多近代大城市，是何等的不同！这里是庄严，稳静，恬适。每一棵树，每一道栏杆，每一扇窗户，似乎都在发射着和平幸福的光芒。在资本主义国家的大城市里，这时候虽是灯光如昼，车马喧腾，而灯光下所映照出来的，是坐着精美的卧车的高贵的绅士和夫人，和徘徊在人行道上，以饥渴的目光呆望着五光十色的橱窗的失业群众。不断的车流人流的下面，翻腾着争夺，吞噬，压榨，剥削……纸醉金迷的剧场和饭店里，表演着颓废的故事，放送着淫猥的音乐，大报社门口闪烁追逐的霓虹灯，用惨绿色的灯光，报道出杀人越货和诬蔑挑拨的消息……
    而莫斯科城的沸腾，是欢乐的沸腾，兴奋的沸腾！在十月社会主义革命四十一周年的时候，七年计划草案公布以后，更新更美更伟大的共产主义建设的蓝图，在亿万人民面前展开了。亿万的人心，就像浓春骄阳下一时齐放的鲜花似地，光气四腾！每一座建筑、每一个角落里都听得到欢乐的兴奋的讨论，义务劳动队雨后春笋似地遍地萌茁了。这一年来，苏联人民的政治积极性和劳动积极性、创造热情、共产主义觉悟空前高涨的成果，正如赫鲁晓夫同志所说的，“每一天都给我们带来关于苏联人民新胜利的令人高兴的消息。”就是我们每天在北京阅读报纸，不也是兴奋地紧紧地注视着苏联人民的新胜利的消息么？当我们读到苏联在1959年一年中连续成功地发射了三个宇宙火箭的时候，我们不是同苏联人民在一起，同全世界爱好和平的人民在一起，欢呼庆贺么？
    十月社会主义革命，是人类历史的一个转折点，从此地球上开辟出一个社会主义体系的世界，这世界里的人民，从人剥削人的制度下，解放了出来，他们的集体的力量和智慧，就转向于建设美好幸福的未来。在科学和文化的不断发展下，人们理想的境界，一天比一天扩大，一天比一天提高，一天比一天推远，一天比一天美妙。社会主义体系内人们的理想，已不止于一个和平团结的地球，而是一个和平团结的宇宙了！
    苏联科学家和劳动人民的卓越的科学成就，在地球外探测了宇宙的秘密，在地球上引起了五洲四海的和平浪潮的高涨，让那些挤聚在战争孤岛的绝峰上的战争贩子们，抱头痛哭吧，让我们和全世界爱好和平的人民，一同在欢祝十月社会主义革命四十二周年的声中，高唱：十月社会主义革命万岁，世界人民大团结万岁，和平万岁！
