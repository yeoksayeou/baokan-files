Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 15th: The Hungarian newspaper "People's Freedom" today published the resolution of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party on the development of agricultural production cooperatives, pointing out that due to the economic consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives, the demonstration effect of socialist large-scale operations, the increased interest of working farmers in cooperatives, and the growth of the strength of the entire national economy, the Party Central Committee believes that the time is ripe to take a big step forward in developing and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives in the new economic year. It is necessary to vigorously carry out propaganda and organizational work to enable more individual farmers to embark on the road of collective management and to further consolidate newly established cooperatives.

This resolution was adopted at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party on October 22nd.

The resolution stated that this year, the cooperativization movement has developed faster than in previous years. The socialist transformation of agriculture has taken a big step forward. At present, the cultivated land area of agricultural production cooperatives has increased from 14.6% in 1958 to 36.6%, and the number of villages and towns that have fully achieved cooperativization has increased from fifty to one thousand three hundred and fifty-nine.

The resolution emphasized that due to the good use of the possibilities of large-scale operation, not only the average yield of crops in old cooperatives exceeds that of individual farmers, but also the average yield of grain per Hectare in new cooperatives established this spring is 10% to 15% higher than that of individual farmers. Facts have proved that the Party Central Committee's policy of increasing crop yields while carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture is correct and achievable. Farmers have also experienced the superiority of cooperativization based on this year's experience.

The resolution stated that adhering to the principle of voluntariness is the basic reason for the achievements of this year's cooperativization movement and the consolidation of new cooperatives. In the future, it is still necessary to strengthen political propaganda work, use domestic and foreign experience to introduce the ideas of cooperativization and the superiority of large-scale operations to farmers.

The resolution pointed out that in developing new cooperatives, it is impossible to ignore the political and operational consolidation of cooperatives that have already been established, and it is necessary to strengthen the assistance of various agencies, organizations, factories, and enterprises to the new cooperatives.

The resolution stated that party organizations have now been established in 70% of the cooperatives, and the number of party members in agricultural production cooperatives has doubled this year. It is necessary to help the party organizations of the cooperatives strengthen the socialist ideological education of the members.

The resolution finally stated that with the implementation of this resolution of the Party Central Committee, more working farmers will embark on the road of cooperativization. Farmers who have joined the cooperatives will conduct modern, large-scale operations more effectively, which will lay a new and significant milestone for socialist development.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 16th: This reporter reports: Hungary has achieved great success in the socialist transformation of agriculture since this year. At present, over 40% of rural areas and small towns across the country have fully realized cooperativization. A large number of new cooperatives that sprung up like mushrooms after rain this spring have been consolidated. The fact that cooperative agriculture has increased production this year fully demonstrates the superiority of socialist large-scale operation.

The Hungarian agricultural cooperativization movement has developed very rapidly this year. Since the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party formulated the policy of accelerating the socialist transformation of agriculture last December, propaganda and organizational work on agricultural production cooperatives have been widely carried out in rural areas across the country. Last year, the average yield of grain per Hectare in cooperatives was more than 20% higher than that of individual farmers. This fact greatly enhanced the prestige of cooperatives among the broad masses of individual farmers and strengthened their determination to take the road of cooperativization. In just three months, the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement reached a climax, and the number of farmers and land joining the cooperatives doubled. Farmers in entire villages and townships resolutely embarked on the road of collective management. Three states have basically achieved cooperativization. By March 31, the number of agricultural production cooperatives and cooperative groups had increased from 3,507 last year to 4,490, the number of farmers joining the cooperatives had increased from 143,000 last year to about 449,000, the number of people joining the cooperatives had increased from 168,000 to 523,000, and the cultivated land area joining the cooperatives had also increased from 14.6% last year to 36.6%.

While the agricultural cooperativization movement was flourishing, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party adopted a series of measures to consolidate the newly established cooperatives. A social movement to consolidate new cooperatives was launched throughout the country. The central and local governments transferred a large number of political and technical cadres to work in the cooperatives for a long time, strengthening the leadership of the cooperatives.

In the agricultural cooperativization movement, the Socialist Workers' Party vigorously carried out party building work and absorbed a large number of activists who emerged in the movement into the party. Since this year, the number of party members in agricultural production cooperatives has doubled. Party and government agencies, mass organizations, factories and enterprises, and state-owned farms across the country have launched a movement to help newly built cooperatives. Each agency is fixed to assist a new cooperative. The state has also allocated several billion forints in loans to help cooperatives carry out public construction and purchase seeds, fertilizers, etc. In order to meet the needs of cooperatives for agricultural machinery, employees in the agricultural machinery manufacturing sector launched a labor competition to increase the production plan of agricultural machinery from the originally planned 15% higher than last year to 34%. In addition, Hungary also imported 5,000 tractors, 3,400 seeders, and 500 combine harvesters this year. All of this greatly helped the new cooperatives to quickly lay the foundation for large-scale operations.

The members of agricultural production cooperatives who have embarked on the socialist road have unprecedentedly high production enthusiasm. This year's spring plowing and spring sowing work were completed better than in any previous year. They have also proved the superiority of cooperativization with their production achievements. This year, the average yield of bread grain per Hectare in old cooperatives was 25% higher than that of individual farmers; new cooperatives were 10% to 15% higher. Now, all cooperatives have built public livestock sheds and built cultural palaces, nurseries, and clinics.

The development of this year's agricultural cooperativization movement has educated the broad masses, trained cadres, and enriched experience. The idea of large-scale collective management is further penetrating people's hearts.

    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央通过决议
    加强思想教育推进农业社会主义改造
    目前全国已有40％以上的农村和小镇完全实现合作化
    新华社布达佩斯15日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”今天发表的匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会关于发展农业生产合作社的决议指出，由于农业生产合作社在经济方面的巩固、社会主义大规模经营的示范作用、劳动农民对合作社兴趣的增长以及整个国民经济力量的增长，党中央认为，在新的经济年度内，在发展和巩固农业生产合作社方面向前迈进一大步的时机已经成熟。必须大力开展宣传和组织工作，使更多的个体农民走上集体经营的道路，并进一步巩固新成立的合作社。
    这项决议是在10月22日匈牙利社会主义工人党中央全会上通过的。
    决议说，今年，合作化运动比往年有了更快的发展。农业社会主义改造已经向前迈进了一大步。目前，农业生产合作社的耕地面积已由1958年的14.6％增加到36.6％，全部实现合作化的村镇已由五十个增加到一千三百五十九个。
    决议着重指出，由于很好地运用了大规模经营的可能性，不仅老社的农作物的平均产量超过个体农民，今春成立的新社每霍尔特的谷物平均产量也比个体农民高10％到15％。事实证明，党中央提出的，进行农业社会主义改造的同时提高农作物产量的方针，是正确的、可以实现的。农民根据今年的经验也体验到了合作化的优越性。
    决议说，遵守自愿原则是今年合作化运动取得成就和新社得到巩固的基本原因。今后仍要加强政治宣传工作，利用国内外的经验，向农民介绍合作化思想和大规模经营的优越性。
    决议指出，在发展新社的时候，不能忽略在政治上和经营方面巩固已经成立起来的合作社，要加强各机关、团体、工厂、企业对新社的帮助。
    决议说，现在，70％的合作社内已建立了党组织，农业生产合作社内的党员人数今年增加了一倍。必须帮助合作社的党组织加强对社员的社会主义思想教育。
    决议最后说，随着党中央这一决议的贯彻，将会有更多的劳动农民走上合作化的道路。已入社的农民将更有成效地进行现代化的、大规模的经营，这将为社会主义发展奠定新的、具有伟大意义的里程碑。
    新华社布达佩斯16日电　本社记者报道：今年以来匈牙利在农业社会主义改造方面取得了巨大的成就。目前，全国已有40％以上的农村和小镇完全实现了合作化。今年春天如雨后春笋般地建立起来的大批新社已经得到了巩固。今年合作社农业增产的事实充分显示出社会主义大规模经营的优越性。
    匈牙利农业合作化运动在今年发展得十分迅速。自从社会主义工人党中央委员会在去年12月制订了加速农业社会主义改造的方针以后，在全国农村中就广泛地开展了关于农业生产合作社的宣传和组织工作。去年合作社每一霍尔特（约合零点五七公顷）谷物的平均产量比个体农民高20％以上，这个事实大大地提高了合作社在广大的个体农民中的威信，坚定了他们走合作化道路的决心。在短短的三个月内，农业合作化运动的发展达到了高潮，入社的农户和土地都增加了两倍。整村、整乡的农民坚决地走上了集体经营的道路。有三个州基本上实现了合作化。到3月31日，农业生产合作社和合作组的数目从去年的三千五百零七个增加到四千四百九十个，入社的农户由去年的十四万三千户增加到四十四万九千多户左右，入社人数从十六万八千人增加到五十二万三千多人，入社的耕地面积也由去年的14.6％增加到36.6％。
    与农业合作化运动蓬勃发展的同时，匈牙利社会主义工人党采取了一系列的措施，巩固新建立的合作社。全国开展了一个巩固新社的社会运动。中央和各地抽调了大批政治和技术干部，长期到合作社中工作，加强了合作社的领导力量。
    在农业合作化运动中，社会主义工人党大力开展了建党工作，把在运动中涌现的大批积极分子吸收入党。今年以来，农业生产合作社内党员人数已增加了一倍。全国的党政机关、群众团体、工厂企业和国营农场都开展了帮助新建的合作社的运动。每一个机关都固定协助一个新社。国家并拨出了几十亿福林的贷款，帮助合作社进行公共建设和购买种籽、化肥等。为了适应合作社对农业机器的需要，农业机器制造部门的职工开展了劳动竞赛，把农业机器的生产计划从原订的比去年增加15％提高为34％。此外，匈牙利今年还进口了五千台拖拉机、三千四百台播种机和五百台联合收割机。这一切大大地帮助了新社迅速奠定大规模经营的基础。
    走上了社会主义大道的农业生产合作社社员，生产热情空前高涨。今年的春耕、春播工作都完成得比以往任何一年都好。他们并且以自己的生产成就证明了合作化的优越性。今年，老社每霍尔特面包谷物的平均产量比个体农民高25％；新社高10％到15％。现在，所有的合作社都建筑了公共畜舍，兴建了文化宫、托儿所和诊疗所等。
    今年的农业合作化运动的发展，教育了广大群众，锻炼了干部，丰富了经验。大规模集体经营的思想正在进一步深入人心。
