Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: TASS, Moscow, November 15th: TASS commentator Orlov writes: New York Governor Rockefeller is traveling throughout the United States. It is generally believed that he wants to check his "market value" in the American political market, as presidential elections will be held next year.

The commentary states that his first speech in Los Angeles showed that the governor is prepared to use his influence and power to achieve goals that cannot be called constructive in any way. Many of Rockefeller's other speeches later, especially his speech in San Francisco, also gave this impression. In San Francisco, the governor called for the United States to lead the establishment of a "new world order." In his Los Angeles speech, he talked about the principles on which he believes this order should be built. He suggested "relying on military strength" and conducting any diplomatic negotiations only "from a position of strength."

It seems that Rockefeller is uneasy about the warming of the international atmosphere. Most Americans, including prominent American figures, warmly support the trend towards warming, but this does not suit the governor's wishes. Rockefeller does not want the relaxation that has already arrived to completely eliminate the tensions. Therefore, he calls for maintaining the keynote of the Cold War. To justify this policy, Rockefeller shamelessly distorts the facts, attempting to hold the Soviet Union responsible for the emergence of the Cold War and its consequences. He needs to do this to argue that the Cold War can only end when "Soviet actions undergo greater and fundamental changes."

Rockefeller, echoing former President Truman, are jointly trying to rehash the "Soviet threat" pretext, slandering the Soviet disarmament proposals, and advocating for the resumption of nuclear weapons testing almost simultaneously; in addition, both of them are stepping up the search for new ways and scopes to conduct the Cold War.

The commentary states that Rockefeller opposes expanding East-West trade and proposes the establishment of an "Economic Defense Committee" to ensure America's "economic security" in its relations with socialist countries. What is Rockefeller shouting about? First, the drafters of the new plan are busy seeking means that they believe can somehow hinder the high-speed economic development of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. They close their eyes to the fact that the policy of restrictions and embargoes has completely gone bankrupt and has in fact led to the opposite result, with those who insist on implementing this policy being the ones who suffer. Second, they hope to create new obstacles to impede the further easing of tensions and strengthen the Cold War in economic relations to oppose the improvement of political and diplomatic relations between major powers.

The commentary concludes that Rockefeller's strategy of provoking a "Cold War" within the scope of international economic relations is in line with the broad commercial and financial interests of the Rockefeller empire in all aspects, but can the governor convince his compatriots that these interests can be equated with the true national interests of the country and the people? We believe he cannot do that.

    揭露美国石油大王加剧冷战
    据新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：塔斯社评论员奥尔洛夫写道：美国纽约州州长洛克菲勒正在美国各地旅行。一般认为，他想检查一下自己的活动在美国政治市场上的“行情”，因为明年将要进行总统竞选。
    评论说，他在洛杉矶发表的第一次演说就表明，这位州长准备利用自己的影响和势力来达到那种无论如何不能叫做建设性的目的。洛克菲勒后来其他许多次的演说，特别是在旧金山的演说，也令人产生了这种印象。州长在旧金山呼吁由美国来领导建立“新世界秩序”。他在洛杉矶的演说中曾经谈到他认为这种秩序应该建筑在哪些原则上。他建议“依靠军事力量”，而且进行任何外交谈判只有“从实力地位出发”。
    看来，洛克菲勒对国际气氛转暖感到不安。大多数美国人民、其中包括著名的美国人士都热烈支持转暖的倾向，但是这一点不合这位州长的心意。洛克菲勒不希望已经来到的缓和将彻底消除紧张局势。因此它呼吁保持冷战的基调。为了替这种方针辩护，洛克菲勒恬不知耻地歪曲种种事实，企图要苏联对出现冷战和冷战的后果负责。他所以需要这样做，目的是为了说明：只有“苏联的行动有了更大的和根本的改变”，冷战才能结束。
    洛克菲勒同前总统杜鲁门一唱一和，他们共同竭力重新搬出“苏联威胁”这个幌子，诬蔑苏联的裁军建议，并几乎同时主张恢复核武器试验；此外，他们两个都在加紧探求进行冷战的新方式和范围。
    评论说，洛克菲勒反对扩大东西方贸易，并且提出关于建立“经济国防委员会”以便保证美国在同社会主义国家的关系上的“经济安全”的建议。洛克菲勒这种叫嚷究竟是为了什么呢？首先，新计划的起草人忙于寻求那些他们认为能够用某种形式阻碍苏联和其他社会主义国家经济高速度发展的手段。他们闭着眼睛不看，限制和禁运政策已经完全破产，而且事实上导致了相反的结果，倒楣的却是那些硬要执行这种政策的人。第二，他们指望制造新的障碍，来阻碍紧张局势的进一步缓和，加强经济关系中的冷战，来反对世界大国间的政治和外交关系的改善。
    评论最后说，洛克菲勒提出的在国际经济关系的范围内挑起“冷战”的策略符合于洛克菲勒帝国各方面广泛的商业和财政的利益，但是，这位州长能否说服他的同胞，要他们相信在这些利益同国家和人民的真正民族利益之间可以打一个等号呢？我们以为，这点他办不到。
