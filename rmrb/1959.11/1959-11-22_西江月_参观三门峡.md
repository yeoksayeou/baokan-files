West River Moon
A Visit to Sanmenxia
Xie Juezai

Cutting off the god's teeth and the devil's claws,
Stringing together a chain of bright pearls.
The dragons leaving the mountains and the fish leaping the gate,
Are now completely restrained here.

On land, the worry is insufficient water,
In the river, the disaster is excessive flooding.
Now it's all stored in a clean bottle,
Listening to me sprinkle it with willow branches. (with picture)

Sanmenxia, Wei Mingshan

    西江月
    参观三门峡
    谢觉哉
    斩断神牙鬼爪，
    镶上一串明珠。
    出山蛟与跃门鱼，
    到此完全约住。
    陆上水愁不足，
    河中水患有余。
    而今装入净瓶储，
    听我杨枝挹注。（附图片）
    三门峡　蔚明善
