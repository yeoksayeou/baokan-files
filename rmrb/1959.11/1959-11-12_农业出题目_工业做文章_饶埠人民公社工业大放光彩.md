    Agriculture Sets the Tasks, Industry Makes the Solutions
    Raobu People's Commune's Industry Shines Brilliantly

    (Reported by this newspaper) The industry of Raobu People's Commune in Poyang County, Jiangxi Province, has become a vital force in supporting agricultural production. At present, the entire commune has a total of 118 factories (mines) of a certain scale, including 36 industries such as coal, coke, cement, machinery, farm tools, lime, pesticides, fertilizers, tung oil, food, textiles, and grain processing. In 1958, the total industrial output value of the commune increased by 4.3 times compared to 1957, among which the output of major products such as coal coke, local fertilizer, lime, bricks, and farm tools increased three times compared to 1957. From January to September this year, the industrial output value increased by 77% compared to the same period last year, and it is expected to complete the annual Great Leap Forward plan two months ahead of schedule. The average cost has been reduced by 31.2% compared to the end of last year, with a total savings of 240,000 yuan in nine months. From January to September, more than 500,000 yuan was accumulated, of which more than 70,000 yuan was used to support the payment of wages to agricultural commune members.

    In order to better serve agricultural production, Raobu People's Commune adopted the method of agriculture setting the tasks and industry making the solutions. According to agricultural needs, ten farm tool factories, eighteen local fertilizer factories, and one cement factory were established. A total of 24 types of tools were modified and created, more than 38,000 pieces of farm tools were repaired and manufactured, more than 10,000 tons of local fertilizer and 118 tons of cement were produced, and more than 2,200 tons of lime were produced. The cement used for the Gaofeng Reservoir and the "March 8th" Reservoir, which were built last winter and this spring and can irrigate 20,000 mu of land, was all produced by the commune's cement factory. This year, there was a shortage of fertilizer for early rice, and the eighteen fertilizer factories rushed to produce local fertilizer in nine days, ensuring the first fertilization of early rice.

    Under the guidance of the policy of taking steel as the key link and coal as the guarantee for steel, Raobu People's Commune used poor methods to establish the coal industry. There are now three coal bases and sixteen small coal kilns. Since last year, more than 18,000 tons of coal have been produced, which not only guarantees the commune's industrial and domestic coal consumption, but also supplies the county's industrial coal consumption.

    While vigorously engaging in self-sufficient production, it also focused on commodity production to support large-scale industry and urban construction. In addition to producing coal and cement, it also produced 120 tons of iron, more than 70,000 tons of lime, more than 16,000 bricks, and more than 5 million tiles, as well as red stone blocks for infrastructure construction. In addition, export products such as pig intestines and button blanks were also produced. This year, more than 2 million jin of lime and 240,000 bricks and tiles were also transferred to support the urban construction of Jingdezhen City, Wannian, Yugan and other places.

    In order to better meet the needs of commune members' lives, the entire commune has established 54 factories producing daily necessities for the people. Cooking oil, flour, wine, food, rice milling, starch, socks, etc. are all produced by themselves. At present, except for high-end products and table salt, general industrial products have achieved self-supply, self-sufficiency, and self-reliance, and there are also surplus parts for sale to the outside. Three power plants illuminate some villages. The development of industry has increased the income of commune members. The transportation of coal, lime, and bricks alone has increased the income of commune members by more than 18,000 yuan. If calculated based on the total male labor force of the commune, the average income per person has increased by 40 yuan.

    农业出题目　工业做文章
    饶埠人民公社工业大放光彩
    本报讯　江西省波阳县饶埠人民公社工业已经成为支援农业生产的一支生力军。现在，全社具有一定规模的厂（矿）共一百一十八个，其中包括煤、焦、水泥、机械、农具、石灰、农药、化肥、柘油、食品、纺织和粮食加工等三十六个行业。1958年全社工业总产值比1957年增长了四点三倍，其中煤焦、土化肥、石灰、砖瓦、农具等主要产品产量比1957年增长三倍。今年1至9月份工业产值比去年同期增长77％，预计能提前两个月完成全年跃进计划。成本平均比去年年底降低31.2％，九个月来节约总额达二十四万元。1至9月积累五十万多元，其中支援发放农业社员工资七万余元。
    为了更好地为农业生产服务，饶埠人民公社采取了农业出题目，工业做文章的办法。根据农业需要，办了十个农具厂，十八个土化肥厂，一个水泥厂。共改制和创制工具二十四种，修造农具三万八千多件，生产土化肥一万多吨，水泥一百一十八吨，石灰二千二百多吨。去冬今春修建的能灌田二万亩的高峰水库和“三八”水库所用的水泥，全是公社水泥厂生产出来的。今年早稻肥料不足，十八个肥料厂在九天内就突击生产土化肥，保证了早稻第一次施肥。
    在以钢为纲、以煤保钢的方针指导下，饶埠人民公社用穷办法办起了煤炭工业，现共有煤炭基地三个，小煤窑十六个。去年以来生产煤达一万八千多吨，不仅保证了公社工业和生活用煤，而且供应了全县的工业用煤。
    在大搞自给性生产的同时又抓住了商品性生产，支援大工业和城市建设。一年来除了生产煤和水泥外，还生产了一百二十吨铁，七万多吨石灰，一万六千多块砖，五百多万块瓦，另外还有基建用的红石块等。此外，还生产了猪肠和扣胚等出口产品。今年还上调石灰二百多万斤，砖瓦二十四万块，支援了景德镇市、万年、余干等地城镇建设。
    为了更好地满足社员生活需要，全社办起了五十四个生产人民生活日用品的工厂。食油、面粉、酒、食品、碾米、淀粉、袜子等都由自己生产。目前除了高级产品和食盐外，一般的工业品都做到了自供、自给、自足，并且还有多余部分向外销售。三个发电厂照亮了部分村庄。发展了工业，增加了社员收入，仅煤、石灰、砖瓦三项搬运力资就为社员增加了一万八千多元的收入。如果以全社男劳力计算，每人平均增加收入四十元。
