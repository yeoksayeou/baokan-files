    Comrade Walter Ulbricht, speaking about the issue of rural development at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, said: "With the construction of socialist agriculture, the countryside is undergoing changes. These changes involve all aspects of life. With the establishment of new production relations, the collective labor methods of farmers, and the utilization of scientific and technological achievements, this great historical step towards a socialist countryside is also eliminating the backwardness of rural social and cultural life that has persisted for hundreds of years. Cooperative farmers have opened the door for the increasingly broad application of the latest scientific knowledge and modern technology in agriculture."

    The newly established rural colleges are a manifestation of the urgent desire of our country's rural residents to master the latest scientific knowledge. The term "rural college" contains respect for our working farmers. They have made such great achievements and are striving to better adapt themselves to the new requirements of socialist construction with the help of science.

    What is a rural college? A rural college is an institution established by the farmers themselves to conduct systematic teaching in the countryside. Rural colleges have registered students, and the teaching work is supported by the agricultural and forestry trade unions, the Association for the Popularization of Scientific Knowledge, and the Machine Tractor Stations. Rural colleges promote the study of natural sciences and social sciences by farmers and assist in the socialist transformation of the countryside.

    Currently, there are several hundred rural colleges nationwide, most of which are in the Potsdam region. We are striving to establish a rural college in the area of ​​each Machine Tractor Station. The "May First" agricultural production cooperative in Wartenburg, a suburb of Berlin (90% of the village's arable land is managed by agricultural cooperatives, with only three households not yet joining), also established a rural college in February 1959. It was established according to the desire of cooperative members to more widely utilize the latest scientific and technological knowledge. The famous German agricultural scientist Professor Mitscherlich once pointed out that if all scientific knowledge were applied, agricultural production could be greatly increased.

    The members of the Wartenburg cooperative elected a rural college council, which was responsible for all preparations for the first semester. The council printed student cards, formulated teaching plans, and recruited students. As a result, sixty of the one hundred and fifty members registered as students for the first semester.

    However, among these sixty students, many lacked theoretical knowledge in animal husbandry, cultivation, and horticulture and had not undergone formal learning. Therefore, the rural college council decided to first teach basic knowledge in the three courses of cultivation, animal husbandry, and horticulture. In the first semester (February to May), each course covered seven topics. The lecturers were villagers, such as agriculturalist Bartel, who passed the state examination, veterinarian Dr. Schulz, engineer Winsch from the Wartenburg Agricultural Technology School, agriculturalist Barch, horticulturalist Buchhard, and horticulturist Kornau. Finding lecturers in Wartenburg was not difficult.

    The topics taught in Wartenburg included: "Soil, growth processes, and evolution processes," "How to fertilize," "Irrigation exhaustion issues," "Root crops," "The use of machinery in root crop cultivation," "The origin and development of livestock in our country," "Cattle raising," "Pig raising," "Infectious disease hygiene," "Land and soil as the pillar of plant growth," "The significance of various nutrients for plant growth and the application of mineral and organic fertilizers," "The principle of distribution according to labor in socialist economy and its application in horticulture," "How to improve the supply of cut flowers?", "Vegetable planting for hygienic nutrition," and so on. This rural college will also add new courses – such as “The Operation and Management of Socialist Enterprises” - and pay more attention to these issues.

    What achievements have these lectures and the subsequent discussions achieved? Has production increased? Has labor productivity increased? Some examples can illustrate this. When agriculturalist Buchhard talked about the mechanization of horticultural production, he pointed out the benefits of mechanized fertilization. Those engaged in horticultural production listened and began to consider: it takes a long time to mix a bucket of three thousand liters of liquid fertilizer, and then it takes a lot of time to apply fertilizer with watering cans. How can this situation be improved? Agriculturalist Buchhard had talked about a water pump that could greatly reduce this work. Therefore, those engaged in horticultural production built such a water pump themselves. This pump sprays the fertilizer contained in a container through the water and distributes it evenly. In less than two hours, all horticultural areas of the agricultural cooperative were fertilized - whereas it used to take a whole day.

    Another example of the effect of the lectures is: the members now say to the tractor drivers who compacted the land without bringing a subsoiler: "Get off the field!" This is what the members learned at the rural college, that is, from the "Agronomy" course. Many more such examples can be given. This shows that the rural college is already carrying out the task of cultivating and educating people. The opinions of the students of the rural college also prove this:

    "The rural college is a place for exchanging experiences. Although pig raising is my specialty, I still lack a lot of theoretical knowledge. In addition, I also want to become an agricultural expert," said Ku Liedemann, an older, capable member who is still studying.

    Lu Hefner, an enthusiastic student of the rural college and the most outstanding horticultural apprentice, said: "Although we learned a lot of basic knowledge in vocational school, it was all theoretical knowledge. For example, we can hear in vocational school which crops need which nutrients. At the rural college, we learn practical things, such as how nutrients affect crops. This is more important."

    Ge Schrol, a member responsible for crop cultivation, said: "Our rural college still lacks general cultural courses, and other farmers cannot hear such courses. Therefore, we have agreed with the newly established rural club to jointly organize reports such as 'The Origin of the Earth', 'The Socialist Education of Children', 'From Ape to Man', 'Women's Diseases', 'The Development of China', 'Review of Sholokhov's Works', 'Jazz Music and Dance', etc." The rural college and the rural club do not exist separately, but cooperate with each other. Both the rural club and the rural college are the center of rural cultural life. (Attached picture) Students of the rural college are studying

    为劳动人民打开知识大门
    柏林市郊的一个乡村学院
    德意志民主共和国   乌·皮茨希
    瓦·乌布利希同志在德国统一社会党中央委员会第四次全体会议上谈到农村发展的问题时说：“随着社会主义农业的建设，农村正在起着变化。这种变化涉及生活的各个方面。随着新的生产关系、农民的集体劳动方式的建立和科学技术成就的利用，这一走向社会主义农村的伟大的历史性步骤也正在消除农村社会和文化生活落后百十年的现象。合作社农民打开了农业日益广泛地应用最新科学知识和现代技术的大门。”
    新创办的乡村学院就是我国农村居民迫切要求掌握最新科学知识的一种表现形式。乡村学院，这个字眼包含着对我国劳动农民的尊敬。他们作出了如此巨大的成就，并且正在努力借助科学使自己更好地适应社会主义建设的新要求。
    什么是乡村学院？乡村学院是农民自己为了在农村进行系统的教学而创办的机构。乡村学院有注册的学生，教学工作受到农林业工会、科学知识普及协会和机器拖拉机站的支持。乡村学院推动农民学习自然科学和社会科学，协助进行农村的社会主义改造。
    目前全国已有好几百个乡村学院，其中大多数在波茨坦专区。我们争取在每个机器拖拉机站的领域内建立一所乡村学院。在柏林市郊瓦腾堡的“五一”农业生产合作社（这个村的农业耕种面积有90％为农业社经营，只有三户尚未加入农业社），1959年2月也建立了一所乡村学院。它是根据合作社社员要求更广泛地利用最新科学技术知识的愿望而建立起来的。著名的德国农业科学家米捷尔利希教授曾经指出，如果把所有的科学知识都应用上，那么农业生产就可以大大提高。
    瓦腾堡合作社社员选出了乡村学院理事会，负责第一学期的一切准备工作。理事会印了听课证，制订了教学计划，招收了学生。结果是：在一百五十名社员中有六十人注册成为第一学期的学员。
    但是在这六十名学员中，有许多人还缺少饲畜、耕作和园艺方面的理论知识，没有经过正规的学习。因此，乡村学院理事会决定在耕种、饲畜以及园艺等三种课程中先讲授基本知识。在第一学期（2月至5月）中，每种课程讲七个题目。讲课人由村里的人来担任，如经过国家考试的农学士巴特尔、兽医舒尔茨博士、瓦腾堡农业技术专科学校的温希工程师、农学士巴尔奇、园艺学士布克哈特和园艺师科尔瑙。在瓦腾堡找讲课人并不困难。
    瓦腾堡讲授的题目有：“土壤、生长过程和演变过程”、“如何施肥”、“灌溉疲竭问题”、“根类作物”、“在根类作物栽培中使用机械的问题”、“我国家畜的产生和发展”、“养牛”、“养猪”、“传染病卫生”、“土地和土壤是植物生长的支柱”、“各种养料对植物生长的意义及矿物和有机肥料的应用”、“社会主义经济的按劳分配原则及其在园艺中的应用”、“如何改进剪枝花卉的供应？”、“蔬菜种植为卫生营养服务”等等。这个乡村学院还要增加新的课程——“社会主义企业的经营管理”等，并且更加重视这些问题。
    这些讲课以及紧接着的讨论已经取得了哪些成绩？生产提高了吗？劳动生产率有没有提高？一些例子可以说明这一点。农学士布克哈特谈到园艺生产的机械化问题时，指出了机械化施肥的好处。搞园艺生产的人听了进去，便考虑起来：搅拌一桶三千升的液体肥料要花很长时间，然后还要用灌壶施肥，这要花很多时间。如何才能改进这种情况呢？农学士布克哈特曾谈到一种能够大大减轻这一工作的水泵。因此，搞园艺生产的人就自己动手造了这样一个水泵。这个水泵通过喷水把装在一个容器内的肥料喷射出来并均匀地分散。不到两个小时，农业社所有园艺面积就施完了肥——而从前却需要整整一天。
    讲课效果的另一例子是：社员们现在会向那些没有带松土器而把土地压紧的拖拉机手们说：“从地里走开！”这点是社员们在乡村学院学到的，也就是从“农艺”一课中学来的。这种例子还可以举出很多。这说明了，乡村学院现在就已经执行培养和教育人的任务。乡村学院的学员的意见也证明了这一点：
    “乡村学院是经验交流的场所。养猪虽然是我的专长，但是我还缺乏很多的理论知识。此外我还想成为农业专家。”一位还在学习的较老的能干的社员库·李德曼说。
    乡村学院的热情学员、最优秀的园艺学徒鲁·赫夫纳说：“我们在职业学校虽然学到很多基本知识，但都是理论知识。例如我们在职业学校可以听到哪种作物需要哪些养料。在乡村学院我们学的是实际的东西，如养料如何对作物起作用。这一点更为重要。”
    负责作物栽培的社员格·施罗尔说：“我们乡村学院还缺少一般性的文化课，其他农民也听不到这样的课。因此，我们和新建的农村俱乐部商妥，共同组织这样一些报告，如‘地球的起源’、‘儿童的社会主义教育’、‘从猿到人’、‘妇女病’、‘中国的发展’、‘萧洛霍夫作品评论’、‘爵士音乐和舞曲’等等。”乡村学院和农村俱乐部不是分别存在，而是互相配合。农村俱乐部和乡村学院，两者都是农村文化生活的中心。（附图片）乡村学院的学员在学习
