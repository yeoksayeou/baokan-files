    New Achievements in the Study of Potato Degeneration Disease
    Degeneration disease poses a serious threat to potato production worldwide. In most provinces of China, potatoes are also in so-called degraded areas, and degraded seed potatoes can only yield one-third of the output of non-degraded seed potatoes. To ensure increased production, a large number of seed potatoes have to be transferred from the remote north every year. The amount transferred annually is about 500 to 600 million jin, which greatly limits the expansion of potato cultivation area and the increase in yield in China. Why do potatoes degenerate? This is a problem that has not been solved by international research for many years. In recent years, most scholars have believed that potato degeneration is the result of the activity of aphid vectors, which causes the virus infection rate of potato populations to increase year by year. Soviet Academician Lysenko believed that the degeneration of potato genetic characteristics is directly caused by high temperatures.
    Based on the experience of Chinese farmers in preventing potato degeneration and on the basis of studying dialectical materialism and Michurin's biological science, the Institute of Microbiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences put forward a new hypothesis: "Potato degeneration does not depend on the virus infection rate, but is determined by: soil high temperature related to temperature difference, which reduces the resistance of potatoes to mosaic virus, thus enabling the virus that has long been latent in non-degraded seed potatoes to exert its harmful effects." After several years of systematic experiments, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, they have obtained strong evidence for this hypothesis, confirming the correctness of the new theory they put forward on the causes of potato degeneration. The further enrichment of this theory will solve the international debate on the causes of potato degeneration, and lay a theoretical foundation for the struggle against potato degeneration in practice.

    Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Psychology
    Made a Cathode Ray Electroencephalogram Analyzer
    In order to carry out research on the brain mechanisms of reflection processes, the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has recently designed and trial-produced a cathode ray electroencephalogram automatic analyzer.
    The brain waves of humans and animals are very complex. It includes at least υ (4 to 7 times per second), ? (8 to 13 times per second), β (14 to 28 times per second) and γ (30 to 55 times per second) and other different alternating current waves. At present, commonly used domestic and foreign ink or cathode ray electroencephalogram recorders can only record complex waves that are mixed together, so it is often impossible to analyze them, which seriously affects the practical value of electroencephalogram recorders in research and clinical work.
    The analyzer designed and trial-produced by the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences can automatically analyze the four main brain waves (υ, ?, β, γ) of humans or animals, and present any one of these four waves separately. This avoids the shortcomings of general-purpose electroencephalogram recorders and greatly improves the ability to reveal brain mechanisms and laws.
    The characteristics of this analyzer are: ① Unlike the mechanical analysis method in British and American capitalist countries, it can not only analyze brain waves in isolation, but also analyze them naturally as a whole according to the characteristics of the brain's alternating current waves; ② It can not only record brain waves by itself and analyze them by itself, but also can be used in conjunction with internationally used electroencephalogram recorders to help it perform automatic analysis.

    Presents New Views on the East Asian Monsoon Theory
    Studying the causes and development process of winter and summer monsoons is of great significance for understanding the formation of climate, the characteristics of weather, the seasonal changes of atmospheric circulation, and the long-term forecasting of cold, heat, drought, and flood. There are two theories about the formation of the monsoon phenomenon. One is the inherent theory, which holds that the monsoon is caused by the seasonal changes in the difference between the cold and heat of the sea and land. The other is a new theory proposed around 1950, which holds that the monsoon is mainly caused by the seasonal movement of the east wind zone, the west wind zone, and the polar east wind zone on the surface of the earth.
    After research, the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences believes that the monsoon is a comprehensive phenomenon under the interaction of sea-land distribution, planetary wind belts, and specific terrain. In different regions and at different times, the three factors can be emphasized differently and cannot be generalized. They conducted further research on the East Asian pressure field, airflow field, and temperature field, as well as their seasonal changes, and discovered many characteristics of China's weather, climate, and atmospheric circulation: Because the effect of the East Asian monsoon factor is particularly strong, the pressure field in the near-surface layer begins to change first during the seasonal transition, while the changes in the upper air are generally not significant, resulting in a lag in the changes in the upper and lower air circulation; and because the East Asian summer monsoon low pressure is particularly strong, it affects the normal annual distribution of pressure in the middle and lower troposphere. The monsoon also affects the distribution of the low-altitude airflow field and temperature field in China, thus forming some unique features of China's climate characteristics. Due to the existence of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in western China, it strengthens the scope of north-south cold and warm airflow activities in eastern China, thus also expanding the scope of influence of winter and summer monsoons. In the study, the rules for the advance and retreat of winter and summer monsoons on the Chinese mainland can be divided into seven different stages. And it is determined that at the beginning and end of each stage, the center of atmospheric activity, the westerly circulation, and the upper air circulation situation have obvious and rapid changes. This makes it possible to avoid artificially dividing the Chinese seasons into seven natural seasons. These research results are of great help to China in carrying out long-term forecasts of the advance and retreat stages of the monsoon, and are also of reference value for the development of agriculture in large areas.

    Chinese Academy of Sciences Alpine Glaciology and Utilization Research Team
    Unveiled the Mystery of the Tianshan Glaciers
    The Alpine Glaciology and Utilization Research Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has completed this year's field work for the Tianshan glacier resource survey.
    Based on the survey and the study of aerial photographs of some mountainous areas, they found more than 1,400 square kilometers of glaciers, with a storage capacity of about 88 billion cubic meters (the glaciers of the entire Tianshan Mountains are far greater than this number), and also initially learned about the unusually rich seasonal snow cover in the Tianshan Mountains. Making full use of these glacial resources is of great significance for changing the arid face of the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains and expanding the cultivated land area.
    Judging from the survey data, most of the glaciers in the middle and eastern sections of the Tianshan Mountains are small and medium-sized valley glaciers (located in the river source valleys), cirque glaciers (located on the slopes in the form of armchair-like concave slopes), and flat-topped glaciers (located on flat mountain tops). The ice surface is clean and relatively suitable as a target for artificial catalysis. The western section of the Tianshan Mountains, especially the Tengri Mountains bordering China and the Soviet Union, is one of the world's important glacial action centers, developing large-scale Turkestan-style valley glaciers. The characteristics of this type of glacier are long and wide, covering moraine rock masses, developing interconnected ice funnels, strong melting action, and significant retreat phenomena, which have a good regulating effect on runoff.
    The team has established a comprehensive observation and experimental station for glaciers, hydrology, and meteorology at an altitude of 3,600 meters at the source of the Urumqi River, and has initially started forecasting mountain precipitation and floods, achieving good results (the accuracy rate of daily average flow forecasting is above 70%).

    科学研究　硕果累累
    中国科学院微生物研究所
    研究马铃薯退化病的新成就
    退化病给全世界的马铃薯生产带来严重的威胁。我国的大多数省份的马铃薯也都处在所谓退化地区，已退化的种薯只能获得相当于未退化的种薯的三分之一的产量。为了保证增产，每年不得不从遥远的北方调运大批种薯，全国每年调运的数量约有5至6亿斤，因而大大限制了我国马铃薯栽培面积的扩大和产量的提高。马铃薯为什么会退化？这在国际上是经过多年研究而未解决的问题。近年来，大多数学者都认为马铃薯退化，是因为蚜虫媒介的活动，使马铃薯群体逐年增加病毒的感染率的结果。苏联李森科院士则认为马铃薯遗传特性的退化，系高温直接引起。
    中国科学院微生物研究所根据我国农民防止马铃薯退化的经验以及在学习辩证唯物主义和米丘林生物科学的基础上，提出了新的假设：“马铃薯的退化不取决于病毒感染率，而决定于：与温差有关的土壤高温，降低了马铃薯对于花叶病毒的抵抗力，从而使早已潜伏在未退化种薯中的病毒发挥其毒害作用。”他们经过几年的系统试验，特别是1958年大跃进以来的试验，已取得了这个假设的有力的证据，证实了他们所提出的马铃薯退化原因的新学说是正确的。这一学说的进一步充实，将解决国际上关于马铃薯退化原因的争论，并为在实践上同马铃薯退化现象的斗争奠定理论基础。
    中国科学院心理研究所
    制成阴极射线脑电波分析器
    为了开展反映过程大脑机制的研究，中国科学院心理研究所最近设计并试制成功了一架阴极射线脑电波自动分析器。
    人类和动物的大脑交流电波是十分复杂的。其中至少包括υ（每秒4至7次），?（每秒8至13次），β（每秒14至28次）及γ（每秒30至55次）等各种不同交流电波。目前国内外通用墨水或阴极射线脑电波记录器仅能描记混扰在一起的复杂电波，因此往往无法据以进行分析，严重影响脑电波记录器在研究与临床工作中的实际价值。
    中国科学院心理研究所设计和试制成功的这架分析器，可以将人类或动物四种主要的脑电波（υ、?、β、γ）自动进行分析，分别呈现这四种波中的任何一种波。这便避免了一般通用脑电波记录器的缺点，大大提高了揭露大脑机制与规律的能力。
    这架分析器的特点有：①和英美资本主义国家的机械分析法不同，它不仅能孤立地、而且还能整体地按照大脑交流电波本身的特点进行自然分析；②它不仅能够自己描记脑电，自己进行分析，还能够和国际一般通用的脑电波记录器联用，帮助它进行自动分析。
    中国科学院地球物理研究所
    对东亚季风理论提出新观点
    研究冬夏季风的产生原因和发展过程对了解气候的形成、天气的特点、大气环流的季节变化特征和冷热旱涝的长期预报，都有重要意义。形成季风现象有两种说法。一种是固有的说法，即认为季风是由海陆冷热不同的季节变化所产生。另一种是1950年左右才提出来的新说法，认为季风主要是由于地球表面东风带西风带和极地东风带的位置发生季节移动。
    中国科学院地球物理研究所经过研究认为，季风是海陆分布、行星风带和具体地形相互作用下的综合现象。在不同地区和不同时间三种因素可以有所偏重，不能一概而论。他们对东亚气压场、气流场和温度场以及它的季节变化特点进行进一步研究，发现了我国天气气候和大气环流的许多特点：由于东亚季风因素作用特别强，在季节转换时，近地面层的气压场先开始变化，而高空变化一般不大，因而产生了高低空环流变化的落后现象；又由于东亚夏季季风低压特别强盛，影响了对流层中低层气压的正常年分布。季风也影响了我国低空气流场和温度场的分布，因而形成了我国气候特征上的某些独特之点。由于我国西部西藏高原的存在，它加强了我国东部地区南北向冷暖气流活动范围，因而亦扩大了冬夏季风影响的范围。在研究中还找到了冬夏季风在我国大陆上的进退移动，可以分为七个不同阶段的规律。并且确定在每一阶段的起迄时，大气活动中心、西风环流和高空环流形势都有明显的和急剧的变化。这就有可能避免人为地把中国季节划为七个自然季节。这些研究结果对我国进行季风进退各个阶段的长期预报有很大帮助，对大面积地区农业的发展也有参考价值。
    中国科学院高山冰雪利用研究队
    揭开了天山冰雪之谜
    中国科学院高山冰雪利用研究队，已经完成了今年度天山冰雪资源考察的野外工作。
    他们依据考察和对部分山区的航空照片资料的研究，找到了一千四百多方公里的冰川，储水量约八百八十亿公方，（整个天山的冰川则远大于这个数字），同时还初步了解到异常丰富的天山季节性积雪。充分利用这些冰雪资源对改变天山南北的干旱面貌，扩大耕地面积，有着重大意义。
    从考察资料看，天山中东段的冰川多数是中小规模的山谷冰川（位于河源山谷中）、冰斗冰川（位于山坡上如太师椅似的凹坡中）和平顶冰川（位于平坦山顶上），冰面洁净，比较适于作为人工催化的对象。天山西段，特别是中苏交界的腾格里山区是世界上重要冰川作用中心之一，发育着大规模的土耳其斯坦式山谷冰川，这类冰川特征是长大、广泛复盖冰碛岩块，发育彼此贯通的冰漏斗，融解作用强烈、退缩现象显著，对径流有良好的调节作用。
    该队已在乌鲁木齐河源三千六百米高处建立了冰川、水文、气象综合性观测实验站，并初步开始山区降水与洪水的预报，取得了良好效果（日平均流量预报准确率在70％以上）。
