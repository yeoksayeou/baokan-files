    It Inspires Us to Move Forward
    ——Reading "Beijing Marches On"
    Fang Bai
    Beijing, like a red giant star, has appeared in the eastern sky for ten years. For ten years, it has attracted the attention of people all over the world. It makes relatives feel warm and enemies feel uneasy. Every time we walk in front of Tiananmen Square, seeing the happy gazes of those lined up waiting to take pictures, it fills a citizen living in the capital with infinite glory and happiness. Ten years ago, this was a different world. In the past ten years, there have been enormous and amazing changes. This book, "Beijing Marches On" (published by Beijing Publishing House), records the great changes in the capital over the past decade.
    One morning ten years ago, when Beijing was still called Beiping, joyful news spread throughout the city: "The People's Liberation Army is entering the city!" From that day on, shouts of "Long live the People's Liberation Army," "Long live Chairman Mao," and "Long live the Chinese Communist Party" resounded throughout the city. For ten years, this shouting has been booming, echoing in every corner of the motherland.
    Who remembers October 1st ten years ago? On this day, Chairman Mao declared the complete death of old China and announced the birth of the people's new China from Tiananmen. Since then, we have sent off the Volunteers to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea from here, and also held grand parades to support the Egyptian people against aggression and support the Republic of Iraq. The Chinese people not only stood up themselves but also hoped that all oppressed and enslaved people around the world would stand up. And when US imperialism openly provoked in the Taiwan Strait, Beijing roared. The night of September 6, 1958, was a sleepless night, with earth-shattering slogans shouted until the dawn of the next day.
    Beijing is marching forward. Before liberation, it did not produce a single catty of steel. In 1958, it produced 160,000 tons of steel, equivalent to the national steel production in 1948. Beijing workers, like workers across the country, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, are going all out, aiming high, and the workers of Shijingshan are striving for steel, the workers of Mentougou are striving for coal, the workers of the electron tube factory are making great efforts in technical innovation, and the workers of the No. 1 and No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mills... are all increasing wealth for socialist construction in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way. Especially the mass steelmaking campaign that unfolded on the steel front in 1958, factories, schools, government offices, troops, rural communes, and street residents throughout Beijing participated in this movement. Right-leaning opportunists slandered us, saying that mass steelmaking was not worth the effort, but on October 26, Beijing smelted 5,134 tons of steel in just one Sunday. This is not only a great achievement but also a significant sign of the capital of the motherland entering the ranks of industrial cities.
    Beijing is marching forward. The rural areas in the suburbs of Beijing, like other parts of the country, have also seen farmers move from individual farming to mutual aid, to cooperation, and finally, all entering people's communes. In order to take the socialist road, people have experienced many sharp struggles. Look at the great debate in the Huoxing Agricultural Cooperative in 1957, look at the birth of the Hongqi People's Commune in 1958, and then look at a holiday in the Yongfeng Commune. People have repelled the attacks of spontaneous capitalist forces in the countryside and are gradually moving towards a happy road. In 1958, the Ming Tombs Reservoir was built, and in 1959, the Miyun Reservoir successfully stopped the flood. The flood disaster was repelled, and there was a bumper harvest of wheat and autumn vegetables. Communization not only brings happiness to farmers in the suburbs but also brings many living guarantees to Beijing citizens. Right-leaning opportunists who say that communization has messed things up, aren't they just talking nonsense with their eyes closed!
    Beijing is marching forward. Before liberation, although it was called a city of culture, the number of students was not large, and there were very few decent schools, and they were all children of landlords, bureaucrats, compradors, and the bourgeoisie, imparting bourgeois education. Only today has the people's cultural and educational cause been developed. Please look at "Qinghua Then and Now," let history be a witness; and then look at "The Cradle of Socialist Builders," and you will know how hard the Party is working to cultivate our own experts and researchers from the working class.
    Beijing is marching forward, with countless new people and new things, and endless new faces and new atmospheres. From the primary school in the mining area to the Great Hall of the People and the museum in front of Tiananmen Square, from the tap water in the small alleys to the new railway station in the bustling city, from the street nurseries to the Workers' Stadium, from the female drivers in taxis to the female representatives in the hero congress, there is no place that does not show the characteristics of our new society. Our capital is the capital of the people.
    There are still many new things in our capital that are not recorded in this book, because Beijing is moving forward, and new things are constantly being produced. But it doesn't matter, life itself is a big book, and we will successively see the second, third, and countless volumes of "Beijing Marches On."

    它鼓舞着我们前进
    ——读“北京在前进”
    方白
    北京，以一颗红色巨星出现在东方的天空，十年了。十年来它吸引着全世界人民的眼光。它使亲人感觉温暖，而使敌人感觉不安。每当我们走过天安门前，看到那些排成行列等候拍照的人们幸福的目光时，它会使一个生活在首都的公民感到无限光荣和幸福。十年前这里是另一番天地，十年来这里起了莫大的惊人的变化，这本“北京在前进”（北京出版社出版）就记下了首都十年来的大变化。
    十年前的一个上午，那时北京还叫做北平，满城里传遍了一个喜讯：“解放军要进城了！”从这天起，满城里喊起“解放军万岁”“毛主席万岁”“中国共产党万岁”的喊声。十年来这喊声一直在轰响，它响遍了祖国的每一个角落。
    谁记得十年前10月1日那一天吗？这一天，毛主席在天安门上宣布了旧中国的完全死亡，宣布了人民的新中国的诞生。从此，我们从这里送走过抗美援朝志愿军，也举行过支援埃及人民反侵略，支持伊拉克共和国的大游行。中国人民不光是自己站了起来，也希望全世界被压迫被奴役的人民都站起来。而当美帝国主义在台湾海峡公然挑衅的时候，北京怒吼了，1958年9月6日北京的夜，是不眠的夜，震天动地的口号声高喊到第二天的黎明。
    北京在前进着，解放前不产一斤钢，1958年产钢十六万吨，相当于1948年的全国钢产量。北京工人和全国工人一样，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，石景山的工人在夺钢，门头沟的工人在夺煤，电子管厂的工人在大闹技术革新，国棉一厂二厂……的工人都在多快好省地为社会主义建设增加财富。特别是1958年展开在钢铁战线上的全民炼钢运动，全北京市的工厂、学校、机关、部队、农村公社和街道居民，都投入这个运动，右倾机会主义分子诽谤我们，说大炼钢铁是得不偿失，而北京市10月26日一个星期天，就炼出了五千一百三十四吨钢。这不仅是大有所为，而且是祖国首都进入工业城市的一个显著标志。
    北京在前进着，北京郊区的农村也如全国各地一样，农民们由单干而互助，而合作，最后全部进入人民公社化。为了走社会主义的道路，人们经历过不少尖锐的斗争，看看1957年火星农业社的大辩论吧，看看1958年红旗人民公社的诞生吧，再看看永丰公社的一个假日吧，人们打退了农村资本主义自发势力的进攻，逐渐走向幸福的道路。1958年十三陵水库建成了，1959年密云水库拦洪胜利了，水灾打退了，小麦丰收了，秋菜丰收了。公社化不仅给郊区农民带来幸福，也给北京市民带来许多生活保障。说公社化搞糟了的右倾机会主义分子们，难道不是闭起眼睛在胡说么！
    北京在前进着，解放前虽然叫做文化城，但学生人数并不多，像样儿的学校也很少，而且尽是些地主、官僚、买办、资产阶级的子弟，在传授着资产阶级教育。只有今天，才发展了人民的文化教育事业。请看“今昔清华”，让历史作个见证；再看“社会主义建设者的摇篮”，就知道党在如何辛勤地培植我们工人阶级自己的专家和研究工作者。
    北京在前进着，数不清的新人新事，说不完的新面貌新气象。从矿区里的小学、到天安门前的大会堂与博物馆，从小胡同里的自来水到闹市口的新车站，从街道托儿所到工人体育场，从出租汽车中的女司机到群英会中的女代表，没有一处不在显示我们这个新社会的特征，我们的首都是人民的首都。
    我们的首都还有很多新事物没有记在这本书里，这是因为北京在前进着，新事物永远在不断产生着。但不要紧，生活的本身就是一本大书，而且我们会陆续看到第二本、第三本，以至无数本“北京在前进”。
