    Chicago-Style Thug Logic
    The United States has occupied the Panama Canal Zone, but protests against the demonstrations of the Panamanian people, claiming that these demonstrations "seriously endanger" US-Panama relations. According to this logic, it is not the United States' occupation of Panamanian territory, but the Panamanian people's struggle for territorial sovereignty that "endangers" relations between the two countries. Therefore, in the eyes of the United States, its foreign relations should be based on the relationship between a robber and the robbed. This is outright Chicago-style thug logic.
    Starting from this logic, the United States can rudely tear down the Panamanian flag in the Canal Zone and massacre Panamanian patriotic students who rush into the Canal Zone and plant their own flag; but when Panamanian demonstrators angrily tear down the American flag, the United States righteously protests the Panamanian people's "insult" to the American flag. Look, the United States tearing down the Panamanian flag doesn't count as an insult, and Panama is not even allowed to raise the Panamanian flag on its own territory, and it even files a complaint against Panama. What a lively scene of a robber accusing the robbed of insulting him.
    In the days when imperialism ran rampant, many aggressors clamored that wherever their flag was planted, that was their territory. Now, the United States' protest against Panama is using this aggressive tone. However, the Panamanian people have already seen: how many aggressors' flags have fallen. Didn't the British occupation forces lower the flag of the British Empire in dismay when they rolled out of the Suez Canal Zone? History is so merciless, how can the United States, which occupies the Panama Canal Zone, be an exception. At that time, the American masters will find that their protests and logic can only help the Panamanian people drive these Chicago-style thugs back to Chicago sooner.

### 芝加哥式的强盗逻辑

    芝加哥式的强盗逻辑
    美国霸占了巴拿马的运河区，却对巴拿马人民的示威提出抗议，说什么这种示威“严重危及”美国同巴拿马的关系。按照这样的逻辑，不是美国霸占巴拿马的领土，而是巴拿马人民争取领土主权完整的斗争，“危及”两国的关系。因此，在美国眼中，它的对外关系应该建立在强盗对失主的关系上。这是十足的芝加哥式的强盗逻辑。
    从这样的逻辑出发，美国可以无礼地撕毁运河区的巴拿马国旗，并屠杀冲入运河区、插上自己的国旗的巴拿马爱国学生；而当巴拿马示威群众愤怒地扯下美国的国旗的时候，美国却振振有词地抗议巴拿马人民“侮辱”了美国国旗。请看，美国撕毁巴拿马的国旗不算侮辱，而且不容在巴拿马的领土上升巴拿马的国旗，还向巴拿马提出控告，这种控告失主侮辱强盗的场面演得多么神气活现。
    在帝国主义横行的时候，曾有过不少的侵略者叫嚣说，他们的国旗插在哪里，哪里就是他们的领土。现在美国对巴拿马的抗议正是使用这种侵略口吻。但是，巴拿马人民已经看到：多少侵略者的旗子倒下去了。英国占领军在滚出苏伊士运河区时，不就黯然降下了大英帝国的国旗吗？历史如此无情，霸占巴拿马运河区的美国又怎能例外。那时，美国老爷们就会发见，他们的抗议和逻辑原来只能帮助巴拿马人民更早地把这批芝加哥式的强盗们赶回芝加哥去。
