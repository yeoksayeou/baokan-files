Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 26th October: The Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent a telegram to the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors of the Japanese Diet on October 24th, protesting against the Kishi Nobusuke government's attempt to pass a war reparations agreement unilaterally signed between Japan and South Vietnam at the extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet.

The telegram stated, "We would like to reiterate the position of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on this issue. The unilateral war reparations granted by the Kishi Nobusuke government to South Vietnam are illegal because they violate international law and are not in line with the current reality in Vietnam. This action violates the interests of the Vietnamese and Japanese people and damages the friendly relations between the people of Vietnam and Japan."

The telegram pointed out, "The South Vietnamese authorities are not qualified to represent the Vietnamese people in the issue of war reparations."

The telegram concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people welcome the struggle of the Japanese people against the illegal actions of the Kishi Nobusuke government on the above-mentioned issue. The telegram requested Japanese parliamentarians to reject the aforementioned agreement for the sake of the interests of the people of Japan and Vietnam, the friendly relations between the two countries, and the peace of Asia and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 1st: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today refuting the remarks made by Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama on October 30th when he submitted the war reparations agreement signed with the South Vietnamese authorities on May 13th of this year to the Japanese Diet.

Aiichiro Fujiyama absurdly stated: "Japan has the responsibility to give war reparations to South Vietnam based on the fact that the Saigon government, in the name of the legitimate government of Vietnam, signed the San Francisco Treaty in 1951."

The statement of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "The above-mentioned statement by Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama has no legal basis, is not in line with the actual situation in Vietnam, and harms the interests of the people of Vietnam and Japan."

The statement said that regarding the issue of the French government allowing the puppet Bảo Đại to discuss a peace treaty with Japan at the San Francisco Conference in 1951, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam reiterated its statement issued on July 20, 1951, "During the period of the Japanese army's invasion of Vietnam, when the Vietnamese people were fighting against the Japanese army, the French colonialists, headed by De Gaulle, surrendered to the Japanese army, and the traitorous Bảo Đại clique willingly acted as a puppet of the Japanese army. They were all staunch lackeys of the Japanese army, oppressing and exploiting the Vietnamese people. Therefore, the French colonialists and the traitorous Bảo Đại clique have absolutely no right to represent Vietnam and the Vietnamese people in discussing a peace treaty with Japan."

The statement said that during World War II, the Japanese army brought serious loss of life and property to the Vietnamese people from the north to the south. It is the right of all the people in both regions of Vietnam to demand war reparations from the Japanese government. The statement pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government's plot to give war reparations to the South Vietnamese authorities goes against the interests of the Vietnamese and Japanese people. The statement said, "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declares that it does not recognize and strongly opposes the agreement signed by the Kishi Nobusuke government with the South Vietnamese authorities on the issue of war reparations to Vietnam. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly opposes the statement issued by Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama on October 30th. The Kishi Nobusuke government must bear full responsibility for all the consequences it creates."

    越南国会和外交部分别声明
    岸政府给南越战争赔偿完全非法
    新华社河内26日电　越南民主共和国国会常务委员会10月24日打电报给日本国会众议院和参议院，抗议岸信介政府企图在日本国会临时会议上通过日本同南越片面签订的战争赔偿协定。
    电报说，“我们谨重申越南民主共和国国会对这个问题的立场，岸信介政府给予南越的片面的战争赔偿是非法的，因为它违反了国际法，而且不符合越南当前的实际情况。这种行为违反了越南人民和日本人民的利益，损害了越日两国人民的友好关系。”
    电报指出，“南越当局在战争赔偿问题中不具备代表越南人民的资格。”
    电报最后说，越南人民对日本人民为反对岸信介政府在上述问题中的非法行为而进行的斗争，表示欢迎。电报要求日本的议员们为了日越两国人民的利益，为了两国人民的友好关系以及亚洲和世界的和平而对上述协定加以驳斥。
    据新华社河内1日电　越南民主共和国政府外交部今天发表声明，驳斥日本外务相藤山爱一郎在10月30日把今年5月13日同南越当局签订的战争赔偿协定提交日本国会的时候发表的谈话。
    藤山爱一郎荒唐地说：“日本根据西贡政府曾经以越南的合法政府的名义在1951年的旧金山协约上签字，而负起给南越以战争赔款的责任”。
    越南外交部的声明说，“日本外务相藤山爱一郎的上述声明没有法理基础，不符合越南的实际情况，这个声明损害越日两国人民的利益。”
    声明说，对于1951年旧金山会议上法国政府让保大傀儡同日本讨论和平协约的问题，越南民主共和国政府重申它在1951年7月20日发表的声明，“在日本军队侵略越南的期间，当越南人民为反对日军而战斗的时候，以德古为首的法国殖民主义屈膝向日军投降，保大越奸集团甘愿充当日军的傀儡。它们都是日军的得力走狗，它们压迫和剥削越南人民。因此，法国殖民者和保大越奸集团绝对没有权力代表越南和越南人民同日本讨论和平协约问题。”
    声明说，在第二次世界大战中，日本军队给从南到北的越南人民带来严重的生命和财产损失。要求日本政府给越南以战争赔偿是越南两个地区全体人民的权利。声明指出，岸信介政府给南越当局以战争赔偿的阴谋，违背越南人民和日本人民的利益。声明说，“越南民主共和国政府声明，它不承认并激烈反对岸信介政府就对越南战争赔偿问题同南越当局签订的协定。越南民主共和国政府强烈反对日本外务相藤山爱一郎10月30日发表的声明。岸信介政府必须对它制造出来的一切后果担负完全责任。”
