Adapting to the New Situation of Continued Leap Forward in Agriculture
Jiangsu Increases the Number of Agricultural High Schools
Agricultural high schools follow a work-study system, with approximately 20 hours of teaching time per week. The teaching plans and syllabi are arranged with reference to the requirements of full-time high schools, and the textbooks used are temporarily those of full-time schools.

(Our report) Since the summer vacation this year, many agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province have added high school classes. So far, 50 agricultural middle schools across the province have established high school classes, enrolling more than 1,300 students.

Agricultural high schools were established under the conditions of the continued leap forward in agriculture and the accumulated rich experience of agricultural junior high schools. Party committees at all levels attach great importance to running agricultural high schools, increasing the number of cadres to strengthen the leadership of agricultural high schools, and allocating necessary school buildings, equipment, and production plots to agricultural high schools. In the more than one month since the start of school at Ligang Agricultural High School in Jiangyin County, the commune Party committee secretary and propaganda committee member have come to the school three times to give reports, and often participate in school affairs meetings to help arrange school work. The commune Party committee has allocated 50 mu of land to the agricultural middle school and has also helped the agricultural middle school to start handicrafts production such as ramie spinning and papermaking. The Shiqiao Agricultural Middle School in Yangzhou City is composed of 11 people including the commune Party committee secretary, production brigade branch secretary, captain, middle school principal, grain management office director, supply and marketing cooperative director, student, and parent representatives to form a school committee, which studies and solves problems such as the agricultural high school's housing, land, cattle, and student food standards.

Agricultural high schools in various places are equipped with high-level teachers. For example, the Yangzhou City Bureau of Culture and Education transferred mostly experienced high school teachers to Shiqiao Agricultural High School. The physics and chemistry teachers are concurrently held by teachers from the nearby Shiqiao Middle School. Some agricultural high school teachers are cadres who have been sent to lower levels. Some agricultural high school teachers are graduates of specialized colleges assigned by the province. Recently, the Provincial Department of Education has transferred more than 200 outstanding agricultural middle school teachers to teachers' colleges for study, and will also transfer 100 outstanding agricultural middle school teachers to higher normal colleges for advanced studies.

The teaching plans and syllabi of agricultural high schools are arranged with reference to the requirements of full-time high schools, and the textbooks used are temporarily those of full-time schools. According to the work-study system, the weekly teaching time is about 20 hours.

The majority of agricultural high school students are junior high school graduates from ordinary middle schools. These students lack ideological preparation when going from full-time schools to half-day schools, and it also takes a process to get used to this kind of school life. In response to these situations, many schools have adopted flexible and diverse methods that are appropriate to the characteristics of young people to strengthen ideological education. The school organizes students to study articles written by Comrade Lu Dingyi and Comrade Chen Guang, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, invites the commune Party committee to give reports, organizes old classmates to introduce the school's development process and learning gains, provides necessary care for new students in life, and holds exhibitions, etc., so that students further clarify their understanding of the nature, tasks, and future of agricultural middle schools, and establish the idea of ​​hard struggle.

All schools have strengthened their connection with ordinary middle schools, and teachers strive to prepare lessons, teach, tutor, and correct homework carefully. In order to overcome the difficulties of lacking teaching equipment in teaching, many teachers use their brains and "borrow what can be borrowed, and make what can be made." For example, the physics teacher of Ligang Agricultural High School uses vertical lines to make experiments on the composition of motion, uses wooden strips as inclined planes, and uses table tennis balls as rolling balls to conduct accelerated motion experiments. Some daily tools and medical devices are also fully utilized as experimental instruments, which have achieved good results. In terms of production labor, attention is generally paid to gradual progress, gradual exercise, and systematic improvement. Due to the adoption of the above-mentioned series of measures, the vast majority of students have begun to get used to the life of agricultural middle schools, and the concept of labor has been generally strengthened. Sixteen of the 51 students in the high school class of Yonggan Agricultural Middle School in Rugao County were named pacesetters in the autumn sowing. The high school class of Ligang Agricultural Middle School in Jiangyin County conducted a test in mathematics and physics before the autumn harvest vacation. The average score for algebra was 79.85, the average score for geometry was 78, and the average score for physics was 76. The teaching situation in agricultural high schools is generally very good now. Students are learning with enthusiasm, and production labor is also relatively normal.

In order to further consolidate agricultural high schools, the Provincial Department of Education recently held a symposium of principals of agricultural high schools across the province. Representatives attending the meeting exchanged experiences in running new agricultural high schools and studied relevant issues.

    适应农业继续跃进的新形势
    江苏增办农业高中
    农业高中依照半工半读制度，每周教学时间在二十小时左右。教学计划和教学大纲，是参考全日制高中的要求进行安排的，教材暂时用全日制学校的课本。
    本报讯　江苏省许多农业中学今年暑期以来，又增办起了高中班。到目前为止，全省已有五十所农业中学办起了高中班，招收学生一千三百多人。
    农业高中是在农业的继续跃进和农业初中已积累了丰富经验的条件下产生的。各级党委对举办农业高中都很重视，增拨干部加强农业高中的领导力量，并且给农业高中增拨必需的校舍设备和生产园地。江阴县利港农业高中开学一个多月来，公社党委书记和宣传委员先后来校作了三次报告，并且经常参加校务会议，帮助安排学校工作。公社党委为农中增拨了五十亩土地，还帮助农中搞起了摇麻、造纸等手工业生产。扬州市施桥农业中学由公社党委书记、生产大队支部书记、队长、中学校长、粮管所主任、供销部主任、学生及家长代表等十一人组成校委会，通过校委会研究解决了农业高中的房屋、土地、耕牛、学生口粮标准等问题。
    各地农业高中都配备了水平较高的教师。例如扬州市文教局调给施桥农业高中的大多是有经验的高中教师，其中理化教师是由附近的施桥中学教师兼任的。有些农业高中教师是下放干部担任的。有些农业高中教师是省里分配的专科毕业生。最近省教育厅已抽调了二百多名优秀农中教师到师范学院学习，并且还将抽调一百名优秀农中教师到高等师范学院进修。
    农业高中的教学计划和教学大纲，是参考全日制高中的要求进行安排的，教材暂时用全日制学校的课本。依照半工半读制度，每周教学时间在二十小时左右。
    农业高中的学生绝大部分是普通中学的初中毕业生。这些学生从全日制学校到半日制学校，思想上缺乏准备，要习惯这种学校的生活，也需要一个过程。针对这些情况，许多学校采取了切合青年特点的灵活多样的方式，加强思想教育。学校组织学生学习陆定一同志和江苏省委书记陈光同志写的文章，请公社党委作报告，组织老同学介绍学校发展过程和学习收获，并在生活上给新同学以必要的照顾，以及举办展览会等，使学生进一步明确认识农业中学的性质、任务和前途，树立艰苦奋斗的思想。
    各校都加强了与普通中学挂钩，教师们努力做到认真备课、讲课、辅导和批改作业。为了克服教学上缺少教具设备的困难，许多教师开动脑筋，“能借就借，能做就做”。如利港农业高中物理教师利用垂直线作运动的合成实验，用木条作斜面，以乒乓球作滚珠，能够作加速运动实验。一些日常工具、医疗器械也被充分利用来作为实验仪器，收到了较好的效果。在生产劳动方面，一般都注意到循序渐进，逐步锻炼，系统提高。由于采取上述一系列的措施，绝大部分学生已开始习惯于农业中学的生活，劳动观点普遍加强。如皋县勇敢农业中学高中班五十一个学生中有十六人在秋播中被评为标兵。江阴县利港农业中学高中班于秋忙假前在数理方面进行了一次测验，代数平均成绩为七十九点八五分，几何平均成绩七十八分，物理平均成绩七十六分。现在各农业高中的教学情况一般很好。学生学习情绪，生产劳动也较正常。
    为了使农业高中进一步巩固，省教育厅最近召开了全省农业高中校长座谈会。到会代表交流了新办农业高中的经验，并且研究了有关问题。
