    Lodge's Wishful Thinking
    During the United Nations debate on disarmament, U.S. representative Lodge spoke at length about how the United States is "completely devoted to peace" and "resolute," based on the fact that "we spend money and shed blood, and we ourselves get nothing."
    It is true that during World War II, the American people spent money and shed blood, and the American people got nothing. But the American monopoly capitalist groups made a fortune, expanded their power, and after the war established hundreds of military bases, still maintains semi-military occupation of Japan, occupies Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, and refuses to end the occupation regime in West Germany and West Berlin... Moreover, it drove the American people to shed blood in Korea, occupying South Korea and Taiwan; it spends tens of billions of dollars every year, and this money is not used for butter, but for cannons; it also expands its political control and economic plunder of countries receiving "aid" through "U.S. Aid." All these ironclad facts cannot be concealed by the United States.
    The United States is willing to propose a joint disarmament proposal with the Soviet Union, and Lodge said that he "hopes to use the Soviet Union's proposal as the basis for the work of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee," which is of course good. However, it is no secret that the United States has constantly obstructed the reaching of a disarmament agreement for more than a decade, and has said so many nice words about being "devoted to peace." Therefore, what is important in the future is whether the United States can truly be willing to reach a disarmament agreement based on the Soviet proposal in action, instead of just saying nice things and doing bad things. Only when this is achieved can people believe that the United States is truly willing to have peace. Before that, Lodge is now eager to whitewash countless infamous crimes for the United States, and cover up the U.S. policy of stepping up the arms race and expanding outward, making people believe that the United States is "completely devoted to peace," he obviously is engaging in wishful thinking. Lodge should know that a motto is popular and adhered to among the people of the world: observe its actions, and heed its words.

### 洛奇的如意算盘

    洛奇的如意算盘
    美国代表洛奇在联合国辩论裁军问题时，大谈美国是“十分忠于和平的”，而且是“坚决的”，根据是：“我们出钱流血，而自己却没有得到什么。”
    在第二次世界大战时，美国人民出了钱，流了血，美国人民没有得到什么，这是事实。但美国垄断资本集团却大发了横财，扩张了势力，并在战后建立了数以百计的军事基地，至今还对日本实行半军事占领，霸占着冲绳和小笠原群岛，不肯结束在西德和西柏林的占领制度……。而且，它在朝鲜驱使美国人民流了血，霸占着南朝鲜和台湾；它每年出了几百亿美元，这笔钱都不是用于牛油，而是用于大炮；它并通过“美援”扩大对受“援”国的政治控制和经济掠夺。这一切铁的事实都是美国所掩饰不了的。
    美国愿同苏联提出裁军联合提案，洛奇表示“希望把苏联的建议作为裁军十国委员会的工作的基础”，这当然是好的。但是，美国过去十多年来不断阻挠达成裁军协议时，不知说了多少“忠于和平”的好话，这一点也不是什么秘密。因此，今后重要的是，美国能否在行动上真的愿以苏联建议为基础达成裁军协议，而不再是好话说尽，坏事做尽。只有做到了这一点，人们才能认为美国真的愿意和平。在这之前，洛奇现在就急于想替美国洗刷数不清的恶名罪行，掩盖美国加紧军备竞赛，向外扩张的政策，使人们相信美国是“十分忠于和平的”，他显然未免把算盘打得太如意了。洛奇应该知道，在世界人民中流行着和信守着一句格言：听其言，观其行。
