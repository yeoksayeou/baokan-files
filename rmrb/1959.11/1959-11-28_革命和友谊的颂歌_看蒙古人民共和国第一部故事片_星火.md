An Ode to Revolution and Friendship
——Watching "Spark," the First Feature Film of the Mongolian People's Republic

    "Spark," the first full-length feature film made by the Mongolian People's Republic, is a successful film that leaves a very deep impression.

    The film describes events that took place thirty years ago in a remote region of Mongolia. Through the reminiscences of the protagonist, Pürevjav, a famous Mongolian doctor, about his childhood, it summarizes the fundamental changes that have taken place in the social landscape and people's lives after the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution, the complete collapse of the feudal system and theocratic ideology that had ruled and bound the Mongolian people for thousands of years, and the arrival of a new era for the people. At the same time, through the cooperation of a young Soviet female doctor with the Mongolian people, it demonstrates the proletarian internationalist spirit of the Soviet people's enthusiastic support for the revolutionary cause of the Mongolian people, and the unbreakable fraternal friendship established between the peoples of Mongolia and the Soviet Union in their common cause.

    At the beginning of the film, we see the new life and vitality that the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution has brought to the people. The district people's government in the border area was established, schools were opened to the children of herdsmen and began to teach new courses. Then, a young Soviet female doctor came here to help establish a medical station, and the herdsman woman, Buma, was her strong assistant... However, this new everything aroused the extreme hatred and hatred of Pürevjav's uncle and master - the reactionary Lama doctor. He forbade Pürevjav from going to the district government, to school, and even more forbade him from going to the medical station and approaching the doctor. He tried every means to sabotage and slander the doctor. At this time, the progressive forces represented by the kind and brave Buma and the doctor, and the sharp struggle with the reactionary feudal forces represented by the vicious and reactionary Lama doctor, appeared before the audience.

    The film closely grasps the theme and cleverly highlights the contradictions and allows the plot to develop reasonably through Pürevjav and his family's experiences and the illness of Pürevjav's sister, Suran. First of all, under Buma's persuasion, Suran broke the superstition of "Lama's salvation" and came to the medical station for treatment; but her mother, instigated by her uncle, dragged her home from the hospital. Later, although she was rescued by her lover, Rentsen, and returned to the hospital, her condition worsened. At this time, the reactionary Lama provoked trouble again. Although the doctor and Buma were fighting selflessly to save Suran's life, her father thought that the doctor had killed his daughter and drew his knife to demand the doctor's life. At this critical moment, Suran appeared and exposed the Lama's deceptive witchcraft and his ugly face. Suran was cured, and the medical work was rapidly developed. Finally, the reactionary Lama was finally caught and brought to justice. Pürevjav's parents gratefully sent the two of them to study medicine and become people's medical workers.

    The film depicts the growth and character of the characters from the struggle and the development of the revolution, revealing the crystal-clear inner world of the Soviet female doctor and her assistant Buma, who have the spirit of revolutionary humanitarianism. The former is a young girl who has just graduated from school, lacks practical work experience, and is kind, enthusiastic and brave; the latter is a simple and spicy ordinary herdsman woman without culture. Although their personalities are different, they have one thing in common, that is, infinite loyalty to the cause of proletarian revolution and unparalleled love for their class brothers. They integrate their personal destiny with revolutionary work. Therefore, they can take practical actions to combat the destruction of rumors and snatch Suran's life from the hands of death in the case of simple equipment and lack of medicine. This is a life-and-death struggle between the new and the old, which is related to the development of new medical work and the fraternal friendship between the Mongolian and Soviet peoples. As the doctor said: "I am not just a doctor here,... I came here to help my brothers,... My father did not shed his blood in vain in supporting the Mongolian people's struggle for freedom and liberation, and today I should come to consolidate this friendship cemented with blood!"

    The portrayal of other characters in the film is also successful. For example, the Lama, who represents the stubborn feudal forces, is insidious and foolish, and Pürevjav and Suran represent the newborn sprouts. Pürevjav and Suran still seem a little weak in the storm, but the enthusiasm for new things is an irresistible force for them to grow and move forward! The two old people are typical of ordinary herdsmen who have not yet awakened. Real life forces them to make a choice about the road ahead, and they finally recognize the truth in the struggle.

    "Spark" is an ode to revolution and friendship; it declares to people that the new forces are always invincible, and the unity and friendship of the socialist family will last forever!

    革命和友谊的颂歌
    ——看蒙古人民共和国第一部故事片“星火”
    葛超海
    蒙古人民共和国拍摄的第一部大型故事片“星火”，是一部成功的影片，它给人们留下了极深刻的印象。
    影片描述的是远隔三十年前在蒙古边远地区所发生的事件。通过男主人公蒙古著名医生普烈夫热夫对自己童年时代的回忆，概述了蒙古人民革命胜利后在社会面貌和人民生活方面所发生的根本变化，千百年来一直统治着束缚着蒙古人民的封建制度和神权思想在彻底崩溃，一个崭新的人民时代已经到来。同时通过年青的苏联女医生同蒙古人民的合作，表现了苏联人民对蒙古人民革命事业热情支援的无产阶级国际主义精神，和蒙苏两国人民在共同事业中建立起的牢不可破的兄弟情谊。
    影片一开始，我们看到蒙古人民革命的胜利给人们带来的新的生活和生命的活力。边寨地区的区人民政府成立了，学校对牧民子弟开放并开始讲授新的课程，接着，一位年青的苏联女医生来到这里帮助建立了医疗站，牧民妇女布玛是她的有力助手……。但是这新的一切却引起了普烈夫热夫的舅舅和师傅——反动喇嘛医术师的极端仇视和憎恨。他禁止普烈夫热夫到区政府去，到学校去，更禁止他去医疗站和医生接近。他千方百计地对医生进行破坏和污蔑。这时，在观众面前出现了以善良、勇敢的布玛和医生为代表的进步力量，同以恶毒、反动的喇嘛医术师为代表的反动封建势力的尖锐斗争。
    影片紧紧抓住主题，巧妙地通过普烈夫热夫和他的家庭的遭遇和普烈夫热夫的妹妹苏兰的生病，使矛盾突出，剧情得到合理的发展。首先，在布玛的说服下，苏兰破除了“喇嘛的拯救”的迷信，到医疗站来治病了；但她的母亲受了舅舅的唆使把她从医院里拖回家，后来虽经她爱人热姆茨救出，重新回到医院，但病情加重了。这时反动喇嘛又进行挑拨，虽然医生和布玛为挽救苏兰的生命进行着忘我的斗争；而他的父亲却以为是医生害了她女儿的性命，持刀向医生索命。在这紧急关头，苏兰出现了，揭穿了喇嘛的欺骗性巫术和他的丑恶面目。苏兰被治好了，医疗工作迅速开展。最后，反动喇嘛终于被捉住法办。普烈夫热夫的父母感激地把他们俩送去学医，成为人民的医务工作者。
    影片从斗争中，从革命发展中描绘出人物的成长和性格，揭示出有着革命人道主义精神的苏联女医生和她的助手布玛晶莹的内心世界。前者是一位刚出学校门的年轻姑娘，缺乏实际工作经验，善良、热情、勇敢；后者是一位没有文化的纯朴而泼辣普通牧民妇女。她俩的性格虽不一样，但有一点是相同的，那就是对无产阶级革命事业的无限忠心和对阶级弟兄的无比热爱。她们把个人命运同革命工作溶合在一起。因此，她们能够以实际行动打击谣言的破坏，在设备简陋、医药缺乏的情况下，把苏兰的生命从死神手里夺回来。这是一场新与旧的殊死斗争，关系着新的医疗工作的开展，关系着蒙苏人民的兄弟友谊。正如医生说的：“我在这里不仅仅是个医生，……我的来是为了帮助自己的兄弟们，……我的父亲在支援蒙古人民为争取自由、解放的斗争中，没有白白地流血，而今天我就应该来巩固这种以鲜血凝成的友谊！”
    片中其他几个人物形象的塑造，也是成功的。比如，代表了顽固的封建势力，表现得阴险而愚蠢的喇嘛，代表着新生幼芽的普烈夫热夫和苏兰。普烈夫热夫和苏兰在暴风雨的冲击中还显得有些柔弱，但无限向往新生事物的热情，是任何力量也不能阻止他们茁长、前进！两位老人则是尚未觉醒的普通牧民的典型，现实生活迫使他们对眼前的道路作出抉择，他们终于在斗争中认识了真理。
    “星火”是一首革命和友谊的颂歌；它向人们宣告，新生力量永远不可战胜，社会主义大家庭的团结和友谊万年常青！
