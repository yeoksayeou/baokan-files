    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 20th: To implement the conditions and guarantees of self-determination, the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic announced today that it has appointed Deputy Prime Minister Ben Bella, currently imprisoned in France, and four other Algerian leaders to hold negotiations with the French government. Ben Bella and others were intercepted by French aircraft and kidnapped to France in October 1956 while flying from Morocco to Tunis.
    The communique issued by the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic stated:
    "The Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic held a meeting on November 12, 1959, to study the development of the Algerian situation since it issued a statement on September 28.
    "The statements made by responsible French officials, particularly the Prime Minister, the Minister of the Armed Forces, and the Delegate General of the French Government in Algeria
  (nothing has yet invalidated these statements), have completely deprived self-determination of its meaning, thus making guarantees for the procedure of a free referendum more necessary than ever.
    "Having considered the press conference held by the President of the French Republic on November 10, the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic reiterates that there can be no ceasefire without an agreement on guaranteeing the healthy application of the principle of self-determination." The communique continued: "Under these conditions, and with the desire to accelerate the resolution of the Algerian issue, the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic has decided to entrust Ait Ahmed, Ben Bella, Bitat, Boudiaf, and Khider with the task of holding negotiations with the French government to discuss the conditions and guarantees for implementing self-determination.
    "If the French government agrees to the principle of holding these talks, the Algerian government will immediately issue its representatives with mandates and instructions necessary to complete their mission."

    阿尔及利亚准备同法国谈判
    任命本·贝拉等五位领袖为代表
    据新华社开罗20日电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府为了实施自决的条件和保证，今天宣布，它任命现在仍在法国监禁下的本·贝拉副总理等五位阿尔及利亚领袖同法国政府举行谈判。本·贝拉等都是1956年10月在乘飞机从摩洛哥飞往突尼斯城的途中被法国飞机截击和绑架到法国去的。
    阿尔及利亚临时政府发表的公报说：
    “阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府1959年11月12日举行了会议，研究了自从它9月28日发表声明以来阿尔及利亚问题的形势发展。
    “负责的法国官员的言论，特别是总理、武装部队部长、以及法国政府驻阿尔及利亚总代表的言论
  （还没有任何东西使这些言论无效），使自决完全失去了意义，因而使对自由公民投票的程序作出保证比以往任何时候更加需要了。
    “阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府在考虑了法兰西共和国总统在11月10日举行的记者招待会以后重申，如果不能就保证健康地应用自决原则的问题达成协议，就不可能有停火。”公报接着说：“在这些条件下，并怀着加速解决阿尔及利亚问题的愿望，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府已经决定委给艾特·艾哈迈德、本·贝拉、比塔特、布迪亚夫和赫德尔同法国政府举行谈判的任务，以便讨论实施自决的条件和保证。
    “如果法国政府同意举行这次会谈的原则，阿尔及利亚政府将立即给它的代表发出委任令，以及为完成他们的任务所必需的指示。”
