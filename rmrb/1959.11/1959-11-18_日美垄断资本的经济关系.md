At the present stage, Japanese monopoly capital is still quite dependent on and subordinate to the United States in terms of capital, technology, and markets. In particular, the traitorous Japanese monopoly capital group places its ambition for foreign expansion on the support of the United States. This is the fundamental reason why the Japanese monopoly capital group is willing to continue to follow the United States, betray national interests, and attempt to drag Japan onto the path of aggression and war. However, there are also insurmountable contradictions between Japanese and American monopoly capital. The deepening of this contradiction will play an important role in the change of Japan-US relations.

American Capital in Japan

Utilizing the special status of military occupation of Japan after the war, the United States has poured a large amount of state capital into Japan, and American private capital is also quite active. It is mainly characterized by technological investment, and it has seized a large number of shares in some important Japanese companies simply by pricing design blueprints and patent technologies. As for direct investment, although the amount is not large due to fear of risk, it is mainly concentrated in Japan's basic industries, strategically valuable industries, and emerging industries.

As of September 1958, among the 827 technical cooperation contracts signed between Japan and foreign countries (of which the United States accounted for 66%), more than half (51.1%) were in the machinery manufacturing industry (of which electrical machinery accounted for 21.8%), with the chemical industry and metal industry accounting for 21.8% and 9.5% respectively. These three industries accounted for the vast majority, totaling 82.4%.

As of June 30, 1958, American investment in Japanese enterprises participating in operations amounted to 32 million US dollars (approximately 11.5 billion yen), mainly concentrated in the petroleum, chemical, and machinery sectors, which together accounted for 79.5% of total US investment in Japan.

During the same period, the 350 million US dollars (approximately 126 billion yen) in loans from the United States (including the World Bank, which is mainly American capital) that have been approved successively were mainly distributed in the electricity, steel, and petroleum sectors, which accounted for 88%.

From the perspective of monopoly group relations, Japan's power machinery industry and power industry are mainly controlled by the International General Electric Company of the American Morgan Consortium and the Westinghouse Electric Company, which is closely related to the Rockefeller Consortium; Japan's petroleum industry is completely controlled by the Rockefeller Consortium; Japan's aluminum industry is under the control of the Mellon Consortium; Japan's chemical industry and rubber industry have inextricable links with the Morgan Consortium; and American state capital accounts for the largest proportion of loans in Japan's steel industry.

The industries with the deepest penetration of American capital are petroleum, aluminum, chemical, rubber, and electrical machinery. The petroleum industry is almost completely under American control. The investment in operations by the United States is 4.8 billion yen, and the loan is 10.6 billion yen. Among the Japanese petroleum companies, the four major companies that account for 56% of the national petroleum smelting are controlled by American capital with more than 50% of the shares.

Americans also directly participate in the leadership of Japanese enterprises. For example, the chairman of Toa Fuel Industry is an American, and five of the eight directors are Americans. The deputy managers of Japan Petroleum Refining and Mitsubishi Petroleum are both Americans, and Americans account for five of the eight directors of Japan Petroleum Refining, and Americans account for seven of the nine directors of Mitsubishi Petroleum who are responsible for managerial affairs. Six of the seven directors of Koa Oil Company are Americans, and the supervisors are also Americans. It can be seen that these companies are virtually equivalent to American branches. In addition, several major Japanese oil companies, such as Maruzen, Daikyo, and Idemitsu Kosan, have no American investment, but have loan and technical cooperation relations with the United States. More than 70% of Japan's aluminum industry is in the hands of Americans, mainly the Mellon Group.

American investment in the chemical industry in Japan is 2.18 billion yen, second only to the petroleum industry, mainly the capital of the Goodrich Company of the American Morgan Consortium, the American Cyanamid Company, the Monsanto Chemical Company, and the Dow Chemical Company; in addition, there are loans of 720 million yen.

In the Japanese rubber industry, American investment in operations is 420 million yen, and loans are 180 million yen. The Japanese rubber industry has inextricable links with the American Morgan Consortium.

Almost every Japanese electrical machinery industry has relations with the United States. American investment in operations is 1.52 billion yen, and the United States has shares in varying degrees in several top companies. Japan's electrical machinery industry relies on the United States in terms of technology, ranking first among all industrial sectors. Japan's electrical industry is under the influence of American capital, mainly Rockefeller and Morgan. At the same time, several top companies such as Tokyo Shibaura Electric Co. have begun to move towards the status of contractors for American capital.

The Japanese industries mainly provided with loans by the United States without equity investment and participation in operations are the electric power industry and the steel industry. Japan's two departments have a relatively solid foundation and are unwilling to let American capital intervene in their internal affairs. Therefore, the degree of penetration of American capital is slightly less than that of the above-mentioned industries. However, these two departments also rely on the United States for funding.

In terms of electric power, it is the department with the most loans from the United States (World Bank). As of June 1958, the loans reached 74 billion yen, accounting for 59% of the total US loans to Japan. Among them, in addition to the US Washington Export-Import Bank and the World Bank, the International General Electric Company of Morgan and the Westinghouse Electric Company of Rockefeller completely monopolized it.

The second is the steel industry. As of June 1958, it also borrowed 12.924 billion yen from the World Bank and 13.063 billion yen from the US Washington Export-Import Bank, totaling 25.987 billion yen. These loans were distributed to Japan's four largest steel companies—Yawata, Fuji, Nippon Kokan, and Kawasaki Steel, with Yawata Iron & Steel Co. receiving the most.

The industries with only individual investment and loan relations with the United States but a small proportion include textile, shipping, and kiln industries (cement, glass, ceramics, etc.), mainly because these industries have neither much strategic value nor high profits, so American capital hesitates to move forward.

Contradictions Between Japanese and American Monopoly Capital

Generally speaking, although Japanese and American monopoly capital are currently stepping up their collusion, the US support for Japan is limited to Japan's inability to get rid of its dependence on the United States and not become a competitor of the United States. The United States tightly controls Japan's economic lifeline, trying to make Japan obedient and become its loyal sidekick. The United States has used its semi-occupied status of Japan, the "common defense" system, and the unequal Japan-US Treaty of Commerce and Navigation to restrict the development of Japan's foreign economic relations. On the other hand, however, as Japanese monopoly capital recovers and develops its strength, its imperialist ambitions for foreign expansion are growing stronger, and it is gradually unwilling to endure excessive restrictions from American imperialism. As a result, the contradiction between subordination and anti-subordination between Japanese and American monopoly capital is gradually deepening. This is a contradiction between imperialists, and this contradiction will inevitably deepen and sharpen with the growth of the economic power of Japanese monopoly capital and the shrinking of the capitalist world market.

At present, the contradictions between Japanese and American monopoly capital are mainly manifested in the following aspects:

(1) Imbalanced Japan-US trade. Japan's foreign trade has always been in deficit, with an average annual import surplus of about 800 million US dollars, mainly due to the trade deficit between Japan and the United States. Japan's annual trade deficit with the United States is more than 500 million US dollars, accounting for more than 70% of Japan's total trade import surplus. It reached 1 billion US dollars in 1957. Even during this crisis, Japan tried its best to compress imports, and in 1958, there were surpluses in various markets, but trade with the United States still had a deficit of more than 370 million US dollars.

The Japan-US trade has always had such a large deficit, mainly because most of the raw materials, industrial machinery, and food necessary for Japan rely on imports from the United States, generally more than 70%.

On the other hand, the United States has imposed all kinds of restrictions on the import of Japanese goods. From restricting the import of cotton textiles, it has developed to restricting the import of plywood, tuna, tableware, umbrella ribs, thermometers, and various groceries. This is the root cause of the Japan-US trade deficit. The military procurement on which Japan relies to make up for the trade deficit is decreasing year by year, from 820 million US dollars in 1952 to 480 million US dollars in 1958, a decrease of almost half, and a decrease of 70 million US dollars compared to 1957. This shows that the burden imposed on Japan by the imbalanced Japan-US trade is getting heavier and heavier, which not only affects Japan's international balance of payments and becomes the root cause of the foreign exchange crisis, but also affects the expansion of Japan's trade with other regions. Therefore, Japan is increasingly urgently demanding to get rid of one-sided trade with the United States.

(2) Japan's demand to transform the raw material market. According to the current market situation, Japanese commodities have very low competitiveness in the international market except for textiles, which is of course a fatal injury to Japan, which mainly relies on foreign trade economically. This is mainly because most of the raw materials come from the United States, which is far across the ocean, and huge freight increases the cost. In order to get rid of this unfavorable state of long-distance transportation, Japan is actively launching activities to find and develop raw material bases in Asia. As of the end of 1958, Japan had 14 mining areas developed in Southeast Asia, including 8 iron ore mines, 4 copper mines, and 2 tin mines; the Rourkela iron ore mine developed in cooperation with India (which can provide Japan with 2 million tons of iron ore sand annually after 1964) has also signed an agreement; in addition, an iron ore mine has been developed in Myanmar and the Philippines in a joint venture. Recently, an agreement has been reached with Ceylon on a long-term purchase of Ceylon salt. Japan's series of market transformation activities will not only directly hit the sales of American products, but also contradict the US goal of controlling Japan and subordinating the Japanese economy to the United States.

(3) Contradictions in capital export. Japan's private investment abroad is still small, totaling 159 million US dollars as of July 1959, of which 34% is invested in Latin America (54 million US dollars), ranking first; and the United States also focuses on this region for foreign investment. Taking 1957 as an example, 34.9% of US foreign investment was invested here. Japan's intervention in the US "backyard" has certainly caused contradictions between Japan and the United States. In addition, in Southeast Asia, Japan's trade with the region is difficult to progress due to the shortage of US dollars in the Southeast Asian region. The deferred payment, yen credit, and "economic cooperation" driven by compensation recently adopted by Japan are all to drive exports by means of disguised capital export. However, Japan's foreign exchange reserves currently only have 1.2 billion US dollars (if deducting outstanding foreign investment, etc., it is less than this amount), and the capital export capacity to Southeast Asia is only about 100 million US dollars, so if it wants to develop in Southeast Asia, it has to beg the United States. Although the United States also gives Japan some small favors in American cotton processing and military procurement, when it comes to fundamental interests, the United States will not agree to let the United States pay for Japan to expand in Southeast Asia, because Southeast Asia is also a US expansion target.

(4) Contradictions in cutting-edge technology. Japan relies on the United States in terms of technology, but the United States is still unwilling to let go of cutting-edge technology such as atomic energy. For example, various restrictions have been added to the atomic energy agreement signed between Japan and the United States. This has caused great dissatisfaction in Japan.

(5) Recently, Japan has spent about 60 million US dollars annually for the United States' investment, loans, technology, etc., including loan interest, principal of matured loans, dividends from equity investment, and patent fees, which is a major burden on Japan's international balance of payments and a factor that causes contradictions between Japanese and American monopoly capital.

At present, the close collusion between Japanese and American monopoly capital is still the main aspect. The economic strength of Japanese monopoly capital is still relatively weak, and the capital export capacity is still very low. It is not only insufficient to compete with the United States, but also needs American capital to "transfuse blood." The minerals mined by Japan in Southeast Asia cannot be effective in two or three years. At the same time, Japan's exports to the United States are about 500 to 600 million US dollars annually, and the United States is still Japan's main market. In addition, the nearly 500 million US dollars in military procurement annually still plays a considerable role in Japan's international balance of payments. This is why the various economic contradictions between Japan and the United States monopoly capital have not yet risen to a dominant position and are still concealed by the collusion relationship. The Kishi Nobusuke government is attempting to revise the Japan-US "Security Treaty" to exchange more American economic assistance at the cost of undertaking more military obligations in order to accelerate the realization of the revival of militarism and imperialist expansion. However, with the increasing growth of the strength of Japanese monopoly capital, the basic and irreconcilable imperialist contradictions between Japan and the United States will inevitably deepen and sharpen.

    日美垄断资本的经济关系
    许琪
    现阶段，日本垄断资本在资金、技术、市场等各方面还对美国有着相当深的依赖和从属关系，特别是卖国的日本垄断资本集团把它的对外扩张的野心也寄托在美国的支持上。这就是日本垄断资本集团不惜继续追随美国、出卖民族利益，妄图把日本拖上侵略和战争绝路的根本原因。但是，日美垄断资本之间也存在着不可克服的矛盾。这一矛盾的日益加深，对日美关系的变化将起重要作用。
    美国资本在日本
    美国利用战后对日本军事占领的特殊地位，在日本倾注了大量的国家资本，美国私人资本也相当活跃，它是以技术投资为主要特征的，仅以设计蓝图、专利技术作价，就攫取了日本某些重要企业的大量股份。至于直接投资，虽然由于怕担风险，为数不大，但主要集中在日本的基础工业、有战略价值的工业及新兴工业上。
    截至1958年9月为止，日本与外国签订的八百二十七件技术合作合同（其中美国占66％）中，一半以上（51.1％）是机械制造业方面的（其中电气机械占到21.8％），化学工业与金属工业各占21.8％和9.5％，这三项产业占了绝大部分，合计达82.4％。
    美国对日本企业参加经营的投资，截至1958年6月30日为止，计三千二百万美元（约合一百一十五亿日元），主要集中在石油、化学和机械三个部门，三者共占美国对日总投资的79.5％。
    同一期间，经陆续批准的美国（包括以美国资本为主的世界银行）的三亿五千万美元（约合一千二百六十亿日元）贷款，主要分配在电力、钢铁和石油三个部门，三者占88％。
    从垄断集团的关系来看，日本的电力机械工业和电力事业主要掌握在美国摩根财团的国际通用电气公司和同洛克菲勒财团有密切关系的威斯汀豪斯电气公司的手里；日本的石油工业完全被洛克菲勒财团控制着；日本的制铝工业是在梅隆财团的操纵之下；日本的化学工业和橡胶工业同摩根财团有着千丝万缕的关系；在日本钢铁业的借款中，美国国家资本占着最大的比重。
    美国资本渗入最深的产业有石油、制铝、化学、橡胶和电气机械。石油工业差不多完全在美国的控制之下。美国参加经营的投资为四十八亿日元，贷款为一百零六亿日元。在日本石油公司中，占全国石油冶炼56％的四家大公司被美国资本掌握着50％以上的股票。
    美国人并且直接参加日本企业的领导。例如，东亚燃料工业的董事长即由美国人担任，而且在八个董事中有五个是美国人。日本石油精制和三菱石油的副经理都是美国人，而且日本石油精制的八个董事中美国人占了五个，三菱石油的九个负责经理业务的董事，美国人占了七个。在兴亚石油公司七个董事中，六个是美国人，监察人也是美国人。由此可见，这些公司实际无异于美国的分公司。此外，日本的几家大石油公司，如丸善、大协、出光兴产虽无美国投资，但同美国有着贷款和技术合作的关系。日本制铝业的70％以上是掌握在以梅隆集团为主的美国人的手里。
    美国在日本化学工业中参加经营的投资有二十一亿八千万日元，仅次于石油工业而居第二位，主要是美国摩根财团的古德里奇公司、美国氰氨公司、孟山都化学公司和道化学公司的资本；另外还有贷款七亿二千万日元。
    日本橡胶工业中美国参加经营的投资有四亿二千万日元，贷款一亿八千万日元，日本的橡胶业同美国的摩根财团有着千丝万缕的联系。
    日本的电气机械工业差不多每家都与美国有关系，美国参加经营的投资有十五亿二千万日元，在几家头等公司中，都或多或少有着美国的股份。日本电机工业在技术上对美国的依赖则在各个产业部门中占第一位。日本的电气工业是在以洛克菲勒和摩根为主的美国资本影响之下。同时如东京芝浦公司等几家头等企业已开始走向作为美国资本的承包企业的地位。
    主要由美国提供贷款而没有股份投资和参加经营的日本产业，有电力工业和钢铁工业。日本这两个部门本身基础比较雄厚，不愿美国资本插手其内部，因此美国资本的渗入程度略逊于上述一类产业。但是，这两个部门在资金上也要仰赖美国。
    电力方面是从美国（世界银行）借款最多的部门，截至1958年6月止借款达七百四十亿日元，占美国对日本贷款总额的59％。其中除了美国华盛顿进出口银行及世界银行外，完全由摩根的国际通用电气公司和洛克菲勒的威斯汀豪斯电气公司两家包办了。
    其次是钢铁工业，截至1958年6月止，也从世界银行借得一百二十九亿二千四百万日元，从美国华盛顿进出口银行借得一百三十亿六千三百万日元，合计达二百五十九亿八千七百万日元。这些贷款分配到日本最大的四家钢铁公司——八幡、富士、日本钢管、川崎制铁，其中以八幡制铁公司为最多。
    与美国只有个别投资贷款关系但比重很小的产业有纺织、海运、窑业（水泥、玻璃、陶瓷器等）等，主要由于这类产业既无多大战略价值，又无暴利可图，所以美国资本却步不前。
    日美垄断资本的矛盾
    总的看来，尽管日美垄断资本目前正在加紧勾结，但是美国扶植日本是以日本不能摆脱对美国的依赖和不致成为美国的竞争者为限度的。美国紧紧控制日本的经济命脉，力图使日本俯首贴耳，成为它的忠实的小伙计。美国利用了它对日本的半占领地位、“共同防御”体系以及不平等的日美通商航海条约等等来限制日本对外经济关系的发展。可是另一方面，日本垄断资本随着自己力量的恢复和发展，它的对外扩张的帝国主义野心越来越强，逐渐不愿忍受美帝国主义对它的过多限制，于是日美垄断资本之间从属与反从属的矛盾也就逐渐地深刻化。这是帝国主义之间的矛盾，这种矛盾必将随着日本垄断资本经济力量的成长及资本主义世界市场的日益缩小而日益加深和尖锐。
    目前日美垄断资本之间的矛盾主要表现在以下几个方面：
    （一）不平衡的日美贸易。日本对外贸易一直是赤字，平均每年入超额在八亿美元左右，主要由于日美贸易逆差所造成。日本每年对美贸易赤字要达五亿美元以上，占日本贸易入超总额的70％以上。1957年高达十亿美元。甚至在这次危机中，日本极力压缩进口，1958年在各个市场上均出现了顺差，而对美贸易仍有三亿七千余万美元的逆差。
    日美贸易一直存在着这样大的逆差，主要因为日本所必需的原料、工业机械和粮食大部分依靠美国进口，一般都在70％以上。
    但在另一方面，美国对日货的进口却百般限制。由限制棉织品进口，进而发展到限制胶合板、鲔鱼、餐具、伞骨、温度表各种杂货的进口。这是造成日美贸易逆差的根本原因。日本所赖以弥补贸易赤字的军需采购，却在逐年减少，1958年已由1952年的八亿二千万美元减到四亿八千万美元，几乎减少了一半，比1957年也减少了七千万美元。这说明不平衡的日美贸易所加于日本的负担越来越重，不但影响日本国际收支，成为外汇危机的根本原因，而且影响日本与其他地区贸易的扩大。因此日本越来越迫切地要求摆脱对美片面贸易。
    （二）日本要求转换原料市场。按目前市场情况来看，日本商品在国际市场上除了纺织品之外，其他商品竞争能力都很低，这对在经济上主要靠对外贸易的日本来说，当然是致命伤。这主要是因为原料大部分来自远隔重洋的美国，巨额运费加大了成本。日本为了摆脱这种远程运输的不利状态，正积极在亚洲展开寻找和开发原料基地的活动，截至1958年底，日本在东南亚开采的矿区已达十四处，其中铁矿八处，铜矿四处，锡矿二处；同印度合作开发的鲁尔克拉铁矿（至1964年后每年可供日本铁矿砂二百万吨）也已签订协定；另外采取合营方式在缅甸和菲律宾又各开发了一个铁矿。最近又就关于长期购买锡兰盐的交易同锡兰达成了协议。日本这样一系列的转换市场的活动不仅将直接打击美国产品的销路，而且与美国控制日本，使日本经济从属于美国的目的相违背。
    （三）在资本输出上的矛盾。日本在国外的私人投资为数尚微，截至1959年7月止共有一亿五千九百万美元，其中34％投在拉丁美洲（五千四百万美元），居第一位；而美国也以这一地区为对外投资的重点，以1957年为例，美国对外投资的34.9％投在这里。日本在美国“后院”的插手，当然引起日本同美国的矛盾。此外在东南亚，由于东南亚地区美元不足，日本对该地区的贸易很难进展，日本最近所采取的延期付款、日元信贷以及通过赔偿带动“经济合作”等，无非都是以变相的资本输出来带动出口。但是日本的外汇储备到目前仅有十二亿美元（如扣除对外投资应付未付部分等，尚不到此数），对东南亚资本输出能力只在一亿美元左右，所以要想在东南亚谋得发展，就不得不向美国摇尾乞怜了。尽管在美棉加工、军需采购等方面，美国也给予日本一些小甜头，但涉到根本利益时，要想让美国出钱由日本在东南亚扩张，美国是不干的，因为东南亚也是美国的扩张目标。
    （四）在尖端技术上的矛盾。日本在技术上是依靠美国的，但是在尖端技术如原子能上美国还是不肯放手的。如在日美签订的原子能协定中，就加上了各种限制。这引起日本很大的不满。
    （五）最近每年日本为美国的投资、贷款、技术等所支出的贷款利息、到期贷款本金、股份投资红利以及专利费等等约达六千万美元，这是日本国际收支上的一个重大负担，也是引起日美垄断资本之间的矛盾的一个因素。
    目前日美垄断资本的关系，紧密勾结还是其主要的一面。日本垄断资本的经济实力现在还较弱，资本输出能力还很低，不但不足以与美国抗衡，而且还需要美国资本来“输血”。日本在东南亚开采的矿产也不是在二、三年内所能奏效的。同时，日本对美国的出口额，每年约五至六亿美元，美国还是日本的主要市场。此外，每年近五亿美元的军需采购，对日本国际收支还起着相当大的作用。这也就是日美垄断资本在经济上的各种矛盾之所以在目前还没有上升为主导地位、还为勾结关系所掩盖的原因。岸信介政府正企图修改日美“安全条约”，以承担更多的军事义务为代价，换取美国在经济上更多的援助，以便加速实现复活军国主义和帝国主义扩张的目的。但是随着日本垄断资本力量的日益成长，日美之间的基本的不可调和的帝国主义矛盾，必将日益加深和尖锐化。
