    A Garden Full of Spring Colors and a Single Yellow Leaf
    Song Huizhong
    Because our cause—the cause of socialism and communism—is the most just and progressive cause of mankind, because we are led by a mature Marxist-Leninist party, because the general line for building socialism formulated by the Party is the only correct Marxist-Leninist line, and because we have Comrade Mao Zedong, a leader who has been tested for a long time, our cause, on the whole, always has achievements that are primary and fundamental, while shortcomings are unavoidable, partial, and temporary. Some are even necessary twists and turns in the road forward. We summarize this assessment of achievements and shortcomings in popular terms as the relationship between nine fingers and one finger. This is a historical conclusion, not a "formula."
    Learning to use this viewpoint to observe our cause can strengthen our confidence and courage, enabling us to see the direction clearly when clouds obscure the sun, and to stand firm when evil winds strike. However, applying this viewpoint in practice is not as easy as distinguishing between nine fingers and one finger. When things are scattered in a broad space, when things unfold with their unique complexity in a crisscross manner, especially when some shortcomings are exposed, some people often lose sight of the whole for a single leaf and adopt a completely negative attitude, saying that everything is "terrible." Right-leaning opportunists have adopted such an attitude.
    Why does this phenomenon occur?
    First, it is a matter of standpoint. Standing on the working class's standpoint versus standing on the bourgeoisie's standpoint will lead to two completely opposite conclusions, because class standpoint determines a person's focus when observing things. Why are right-leaning opportunists so enthusiastic about the shortcomings of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes? Why do they continue to cling to some shortcomings that have already been overcome or are being overcome? It is because they reflect the desires of the bourgeoisie, wanting to continue to maintain or even expand the remnants of the private ownership system. Due to the different class standpoints, right and wrong are completely reversed by them. A great good thing becomes a great bad thing. Firmly standing on the working-class standpoint is a prerequisite for correctly observing our cause, recognizing the situation, and objectively measuring the achievements and shortcomings in our work.
    Once the standpoint is resolved, there is still the issue of how to observe things. Having the correct standpoint sometimes does not prevent making mistakes. This means that the materials and examples that form one's own views should be subjected to scientific analysis of "discarding the crude and retaining the refined, discarding the false and retaining the true, proceeding from this to that, and from the outside to the inside." One should also be able to jump out of the narrow circle of one's own life experience, listen to the opinions of others, and listen to the opinions of the masses. To ensure that one does not fall into subjective and one-sided errors, one must especially resolutely listen to the Party's words. We see that some comrades make mistakes when observing our cause also because they excessively trust their narrow, one-sided, and direct sensory perceptions. For example, one comrade often cites certain examples from his family, relatives, or villages to prove that his erroneous view is correct and has a basis. When others criticize him, he still says plausibly, "What I said are all facts!" He seems to respect materialism on the surface, but this is a narrow, one-sided, and empirical way of understanding things. Because in such a large society, in mass movements involving hundreds of millions of people, what an individual comes into contact with is only a point, a small aspect, a small part. A single yellow leaf cannot represent autumn. The yellowing of leaves is one of the signs of the arrival of autumn. However, even in the most lush spring, one can find one or two yellowing leaves. In social life, in the great movement of hundreds of millions of people transforming society and nature, what is there to be surprised about in finding one or two shortcomings?! At this time, the most important thing is not to be blinded by a single yellow leaf and not see the garden full of spring colors with strong roots and flourishing branches. Do not be deceived by some superficial and individual phenomena. True, we are materialists, and we respect facts, but remember, we are not metaphysical materialists, but dialectical materialists. Therefore, when observing our cause, when establishing a point of view, one cannot rely solely on one's narrow experience, but must see the entire picture of social life; one cannot rely solely on three or two so-called "facts," but must rely on the more massive thousands upon thousands of facts that make up the basic features of society. As Lenin said, "Because social life phenomena are extremely complex, one can always find any number of examples or individual materials to confirm any opinion" (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 22, page 182). Leaving the dialectical materialism, one cannot correctly understand or reflect things, which will make people short-sighted, subjective, and one-sided, and will inevitably lead to empiricism and egoism, transforming from metaphysical materialism to subjective idealism, and developing from errors in understanding to errors in standpoint.
    The danger of right-leaning thought lies precisely here.

    满园春色和一片黄叶
    宋慧中
    由于我们的事业——社会主义、共产主义事业——是人类最正义、最进步的事业，由于领导着我们的是一个成熟的马克思列宁主义政党，由于党所制定的建设社会主义的总路线是一条唯一正确的马克思列宁主义路线，由于我们有了毛泽东同志这样一个久经考验的领袖，所以，我们的事业，就全局来说，成绩总是主要的、基本的，缺点则带有不可避免的、局部的、暂时的性质，有的甚至是前进道路中的一些必要的曲折。我们把这种对成绩和缺点的估量，通俗地概括为九个指头和一个指头的关系。这是历史的结论，而绝不是什么“公式”。
    学会运用这种观点去观察我们的事业，就可以使我们增强信心和勇气，当片云遮日的时候，能看得清方向；当歪风袭来的时候，能站得住脚跟。但在实践中运用这种观点，并不像区分九个指头与一个指头那样容易，当事物散布在一个广阔的空间的时候，当事物以它的特有的复杂性纵横交错的展开的时候，特别是在暴露了一些缺点的时候，有些人往往是一叶障目，采取了全盘否定的态度，说一切都“糟得很”。右倾机会主义分子就采取了这样的态度。
    为什么会出现这样的现象呢？
    首先是立场问题。站在工人阶级立场与站在资产阶级立场，就会得出两个完全相反的结论来。因为阶级立场规定了一个人观察事物的着眼点。为什么右倾机会主义分子对总路线、大跃进、人民公社的一些缺点那样热衷呢？为什么对于一些已经克服或正在克服的缺点，他们还要抓在手里不放呢？就是因为他们反映了资产阶级的愿望，想要继续保持甚至要扩大私有制度的残余。由于阶级立场的不同，是非就完全被他们颠倒了。天大的好事变成了天大的坏事。坚定地站稳工人阶级立场，这是正确地观察我们的事业，认清形势，客观地衡量我们工作中的成绩与缺点的一个先决条件。
    立场解决了，还有观察事物的方法问题，光有正确的立场有时并不能避免犯错误。这就是说，对于形成自己的观点的那些材料、事例，要加以“去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里”的科学分析，还要能够跳出自己的狭隘的生活经验的圈子，听一听别人的意见，听一听人民群众的意见，为了保证自己不陷入主观片面的错误，尤其要坚决地听党的话。我们看到有些同志，他们在观察我们的事业的时候之所以犯错误，也还由于他们过分地信赖自己的狭隘的、片面的、直观的感性认识。比如有位同志常常援引他的家庭、亲友、或是乡里中的某些事例，来证明他的错误看法是对的，有根据的。当别人批驳他的时候，他还振振有词地说：“我说的全是事实呀！”他表面上好像很尊重唯物论，其实这是一种狭隘的、片面的、经验主义的认识事物的方法。因为偌大的一个社会，亿万人参加的群众运动，个人所接触到的只是一点、一个小的侧面、一个小的局部。一片黄叶并不能代表秋天。树叶黄了，这是秋天到来的标志之一。但是，就是在春意最浓的时候，也可以找到一片两片发黄的叶子。在社会生活中，在亿万群众翻天复地改造社会、改造自然的伟大运动中，找到了那么一条两条的缺点，有什么值得大惊小怪的呢？！这时候，最重要的是，不要为一片黄叶障目，而看不见本固枝荣的满园春色。不要被一些表面的、个别的现象所迷惑。不错，我们是唯物主义者，我们尊重事实，但要记住，我们不是形而上学的唯物主义者，而是辩证唯物主义者。因此，在观察我们的事业的时候，在确立一种观点的时候，就不能只凭自己的狭隘经验，而要看得见社会生活的整个画面；就不能只根据三件两件所谓“事实”，而要根据组成社会基本面貌的更大量的千千万万件事实。列宁说的好：“因为社会生活现象极端复杂，随时都可以找到任何数量的例子或个别的材料来证实任何一种意见”（列宁全集22卷182页）。离开辩证法的唯物论，是不能正确地认识或反映事物的，它会使人变得目光短浅，主观片面，而最后必然会导致经验主义、唯我主义，由形而上学的唯物论蜕变为主观唯心论，由认识上的错误发展成为立场上的错误。
    右倾思想的危险性也正在这里。
