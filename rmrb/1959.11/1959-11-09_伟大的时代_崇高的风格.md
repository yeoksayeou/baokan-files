    Great Era, Lofty Style
    Happy to See Green Leaves Become Peonies

    "Peonies are good, but they need green leaves to support them." This is a good saying. People often use it to encourage others, especially to encourage the "king of flowers," the peony, which represents the heroic figures among the people, not to become detached from the masses; and also to encourage the masses to support these heroic figures. Now, it seems that the limitations of this saying have been broken through by the heroes of our time. They are not satisfied with being the peony while others are the green leaves. In their view, there should be no backward people alongside advanced producers. They use their practical actions to drive those around them, turning the backward into the advanced, and the green leaves into peonies.

    There are thousands upon thousands of such new figures. Comrade Cao Huiju of the Shanghai Yonghe Sewing Machine Needle Factory is one who has been warmly praised.

    Cao Huiju is a 23-year-old member of the Communist Youth League and is a well-known quick hand at grinding sewing machine needles at the Shanghai Sewing Machine Needle Factory. As soon as she arrived at the factory, she encountered Kong Zili, who had always been known as a "slow hand at grinding." Kong Zili's output was less than half that of others, and she produced many defective products. Why was this the case? Some said she "lacked enthusiasm," others said she had "poor labor discipline," and many people asked to have her transferred out of the group. One day, the workshop director, holding a pile of defective products in his hands, said to Kong Zili, "How come you keep producing defective products? You have to pay more attention in the future." Kong Zili's face turned red, and tears flowed silently. Obviously, people saw that there was a problem, but they did not seriously study what the problem was, so the problem remained a problem. We encounter many such things.

    Cao Huiju took a different attitude. She patiently understood Kong Zili, treated her difficulties as her own, and helped her overcome them with great enthusiasm. She first used her own hard work to make up for Kong Zili's shortfall and complete the group's plan. She found that the machine Kong Zili was using was not working well, so she replaced it with the one she was using and carefully helped her master the grinding techniques. She found that Kong Zili had many children, so she suggested that Kong Zili work the day shift and she work the night shift. Cao Huiju's selfless communist spirit moved Kong Zili to tears. The comrades in the group were also greatly encouraged, and everyone came to help Kong Zili. Kong Zili, of course, also worked extra hard. Thus, the red flag that had always been held by Cao Huiju was transferred to Kong Zili in May. At this time, some people in the factory said that Cao Huiju was really a "big fool," but Cao Huiju was even happier than when she had received the red flag herself, and rushed to Kong Zili's house that night to report the good news: "I want to learn from you." What is moving about Cao Huiju is not only that she regards helping others as her greatest happiness, but also that when difficulties come her way, she has no complaints at all. Because the machine that Kong Zili had newly exchanged for was very inconvenient to use, Cao Huiju's output and quality both declined sharply. Of course, she was very sad. She asked herself, "Can I achieve high output and high quality even with a bad machine?" After tenacious study and diligent research, she was finally re-elected as a red flag bearer and led the entire group to unite and achieve high output every month, becoming an advanced group. Here, it is no longer a single flower blooming alone, but a profusion of flowers blooming everywhere.

    This reminds us of the older generation of Communist Party members, who also led us forward in this way. They did not despise or blame us because we were young and backward. On the contrary, they patiently understood us, helped us, and even took us by the hand to lead us forward. Just as the Party has always taught us, we must correctly treat the masses around us. In our working people's ranks, there will still be backward people ten thousand years from now. However, there should be no backward people beside communists. That is to say, when there are backward people, we need to patiently understand them, help them, so that they not only catch up with but also surpass us. We do this not out of the hypocritical compassion of the bourgeoisie, but out of a lofty communist ideology. We have never forgotten that the flames of class struggle have not been extinguished. Tirelessly educating the masses around us, arming them with communist ideology, liberating them from the influence of the bourgeoisie, and raising those in intermediate and backward states to an advanced level is not only a form of class struggle, but also a sign of the working class's victory over the bourgeoisie, and a duty that every Communist Party member cannot shirk.

    From Cao Huiju and other advanced figures like her, we see that this idea of the Party has taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit. Socialist and communist ideas are increasingly widely and deeply grasped by the masses, becoming the style of tens of thousands of people. It will continue to guide tens of thousands of advanced elements to help their comrades catch up with and surpass themselves. We will not only be able to defeat the enemy and transform the old society, but also conquer nature and build a new world. The glorious and bright future of our motherland, our great hope, lies here.

    Help the Backward Catch Up with the Advanced

    To correctly resolve the contradiction between the advanced and the backward, we must use the correct and developing new perspective, not the static and outdated old perspective. Everything in the world is developing, and the advanced and the backward are no exception. For example, in the past, an individual actively working and completing the state plan outstandingly was an advanced producer; today, merely working actively and completing the state plan outstandingly may not necessarily make one a recognized advanced producer. Selflessness and communist style are the main signs of an advanced producer recognized by the masses today. See, the names of advanced and backward have not changed, but the content has changed and developed. The contradiction between the advanced and the backward, as Chairman Mao pointed out, belongs to the nature of contradictions among the people. For more than two years, we have implemented Chairman Mao's instruction on correctly handling contradictions among the people, promoted production, enhanced unity, and created a variety of good experiences and methods for helping the backward to transform. However, it would be inappropriate to think that there are no problems in dealing with this contradiction of the people's nature between the advanced and the backward. In terms of attitude and methods towards the backward, adopting a comradely attitude and persuasive methods is our leading and decisive aspect. However, the attitude towards the backward is not a comradely attitude, and the method used is not persuasion, but the attitude and method of "isolate, rectify, and transfer" still exist in a small number of people in enterprises, even some activists.

    This erroneous attitude and method have caused some backward workers to be transferred from one group to another, from one workshop to another, becoming "vagrants" within the enterprise. Not only did it fail to solve their ideological problems and enhance unity, but on the contrary, it made comrade relations more tense and affected production. The results of practice have fully proved the complete bankruptcy of "isolate, rectify, and transfer"! Abandoning the attitude and method of "isolate, rectify, and transfer" and adopting the attitude and method of "unity-criticism-unity" can transform the backward, who are "unwanted" throughout the factory, into advanced workers.

    In the contradiction between the advanced and the backward, the advanced are the main aspect of the contradiction. The advanced play a considerable role in whether the backward transform faster or slower, more thoroughly or superficially. The size of the role depends on whether the advanced have more or less communist ideas, and whether the communist style is higher or lower. The advanced are not only production pacesetters, but must also strive to become ideological pacesetters of communism. Our advanced producers now have a popular slogan: "We want honor, not material rewards." This slogan is very good! But what kind of honor does our working class need? It should be known that the sense of honor has a class nature. Many people do not fully understand what the working class's sense of honor is like and what the bourgeoisie's sense of honor is like. In some advanced producers, some people are also worried that "helping others will lose their own honor," and some advanced groups even transfer temporarily backward comrades in order to "maintain honor." This kind of sense of honor is unacceptable. It is the bourgeoisie's individualistic sense of honor, which is incompatible with our working class's collectivist sense of honor. It is an obstacle to resolving the contradiction between the advanced and the backward and must be eradicated.

### 伟大的时代　崇高的风格

    伟大的时代　崇高的风格
    喜看绿叶成牡丹
    “牡丹虽好，还要绿叶相扶。”这是一句好话。人们常常用它来勉励别人，特别是勉励那些“花中之王”的牡丹，也就是人民群众中的英雄人物，不要脱离群众；也勉励群众，支持英雄人物。现在看来，这句话的局限性已经被当代的英雄突破了。他们不满足于自己当牡丹，别人作绿叶，在他们看来，先进生产者的旁边不应当有落后的人。他们用自己的实际行动，带动了周围的人们，使落后的变成了先进的，绿叶变成了牡丹。
    这样的新人物有成千成万。上海永和缝纫机制针厂的曹慧菊同志，就是受到人们热烈赞扬的一个。
    曹慧菊是一个二十三岁的共产主义青年团团员，是上海缝纫机制针厂闻名的缝纫机针磨平快手，一到这个厂子就碰到了一向被人称为“磨平慢手”的孔自力。孔自力的产量不及别人的一半，废次品又出得多。为什么会这样呢？有的人说她“干劲不足”，有的人说她“劳动纪律不好”，不少人要求把她从小组里调出去。有一天，车间主任手里捧着一堆废品，朝着孔自力说：“你怎么老是出废品，以后要多多注意呀。”孔自力的面孔刷地红了，眼泪暗暗地流出来。显然，人们看到了有问题，却并没有认真地研究一下是什么问题，因而问题还是问题。这样的事，我们碰到的不少。
    曹慧菊采取了不同的态度。她耐心地了解孔自力，把她的困难当作自己的困难，满腔热情地帮助她克服困难。她首先用自己多做活的办法，来弥补孔自力的缺额，完成小组的计划。她发现孔自力用的那台车子不好使，便把自己用的一台换给她，并且细心地帮助她掌握磨平的技巧。她发现孔自力的孩子多，便建议让孔自力做日班，自己做夜班。曹慧菊的这种舍己为人的共产主义精神，使孔自力感动得流下泪来。小组的同志们也受到很大的鼓舞，大家都来帮助孔自力。孔自力当然也分外努力。这样，一直保持在曹慧菊手里的红旗，到了5月份，就转移到孔自力手里。这时，厂里有的人说曹慧菊真是“大傻瓜”，曹慧菊却比自己得到红旗还高兴，连夜赶到孔自力家里去报喜：“我要向你学习。”曹慧菊感动人的地方，不但是她把帮助别人当作自己最大的快乐，而且当困难压到自己头上的时候，也丝毫没有怨言。由于新换来的孔自力的那台车子，用起来很不方便，曹慧菊的产量和质量都直线下降了。她当然很难过。她问自己：“能不能用坏车子也来个高产优质呢？”经过顽强的学习，刻苦的钻研，她终于又重新被评为红旗手，并且带动整个小组，团结一致，月月高产，成了先进小组。在这里，已经不是一花独放，而是繁花满枝了。
    这使我们想起了老一辈的共产党员，他们不也是这样带领我们前进的吗？他们并没有因为我们幼稚、落后，而厌恶我们、责备我们。相反地，他们耐心地了解我们，帮助我们，甚至走一步、拉一把地把我们带起来。正像党历来教导我们的，要正确地对待周围的群众。在我们劳动人民的队伍里，落后的人，一万年以后也还是有的。但是，在共产主义者旁边不应当有落后的人。就是说，有了落后的人，就需要我们耐心地了解他们，帮助他们，使他们不但赶上而且超过我们。我们所以这样作，并不是出于资产阶级的虚伪的慈悲心肠，而是出于崇高的共产主义思想。我们从来没有忘记，阶级斗争的火焰并没有熄灭。不疲倦地教育周围的群众，用共产主义思想武装群众，把他们从资产阶级的影响下解放出来，把处于中间和落后状态的人们提高到先进的水平，这不仅是阶级斗争的一种形式，而且是工人阶级战胜资产阶级的标志，是我们每一个共产党人的责无旁贷的义务。
    从曹慧菊和同她一样的那些先进人物的身上，我们看到了党的这种思想已经扎根、开花、结果。社会主义和共产主义思想，愈来愈广泛和深入地掌握了群众，成为成千成万的人们的风格。它将继续引导成千成万的先进分子帮助自己的同伴赶上和超过自己。我们将不但能够战胜敌人，改造旧社会，而且能够征服自然，建设新世界。我们祖国的光辉灿烂的前途，我们伟大的希望，就在这里。
      （摘自上海“解放”第二十一期张春桥文）
    要帮落后赶先进
    正确地解决先进与落后间的矛盾，要用正确的发展的新眼光，不能用静止的陈旧的老眼光。世界上的一切事物都是发展的，先进与落后也不例外。比如，在过去，个人积极劳动，出色地完成国家计划，就是一个先进生产者；到今天，仅仅个人积极劳动，出色地完成国家计划，就不一定能成为一个公认的先进生产者。忘我精神，共产主义风格，这是今天群众公认的先进生产者的主要标志。请看，先进与落后的名称没变，但是内容改变了，发展了。先进与落后间的矛盾，正如毛主席所指示的，属于人民内部矛盾的性质。两年多以来，我们执行毛主席正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示，促进了生产，增强了团结，创造了多种多样的帮助落后转变的好经验、好方法。但是，因此而认为在处理先进与落后间这个属于人民内部性质的矛盾时已经没有问题，就不妥当了。在对待落后者的态度和方法上，采用同志的态度、说服的方法，这是我们的主导的起决定作用的一面。然而，对待落后者所持的不是同志的态度，采用的不是说服的方法，而是“一孤、二整、三调走”的态度和方法，在企业的少数人中，甚至某些积极分子中还是存在的。
    这种错误态度和方法，使某些落后工人从这个小组调到那个小组，从这个车间调到那个车间，成了企业内的“游民”。不仅没能解决他们的思想问题，增强团结，相反的使同志关系更加紧张，影响了生产。实践的结果完全证明了“一孤、二整、三调走”的彻底破产！抛弃“一孤、二整、三调走”的态度和方法，采取“团结——批评——团结”的态度和方法，就能使落后到全厂“没人要”的落后者转变为先进者。
    先进者与落后者之间的矛盾，先进者是矛盾的主要方面，在落后者转变得快些还是慢些、彻底些还是肤浅些这个问题上，先进者起着相当大的作用。作用的大小，决定于先进者的共产主义思想是多一些还是少一些，共产主义风格是高一些还是低一些。先进者不仅是生产的标兵，而且一定要努力成为共产主义思想的标兵。我们的先进生产者中现在流行着一个口号：要荣誉，不要物质奖励。这个口号好得很！但是，我们工人阶级所需要的是什么样的荣誉呢？要知道，荣誉感这个东西是有阶级性的。工人阶级的荣誉感是怎样，资产阶级的荣誉感又是怎样，许多人还不甚明了。在一些先进生产者中，也有人担心“帮助别人，丢掉自己的荣誉”甚至有些先进小组不惜把暂时落后的同志调走以“保持荣誉”。这样的荣誉感要不得，它是资产阶级个人主义的荣誉感，和我们工人阶级集体主义的荣誉感水火不容，是解决先进与落后间矛盾的障碍，非得铲除不可。
