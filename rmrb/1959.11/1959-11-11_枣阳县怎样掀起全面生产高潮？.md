How Zao Yang County Launched a Comprehensive Production Upsurge?
By Sun Jianxiu, First Secretary of the Zao Yang County Party Committee

Look Ahead in Everything, Plan Early in Everything

Zao Yang County has a lot of land but not enough labor. In the past, some cadres and the masses regarded this favorable condition for developing production as a difficulty, as an excuse for backward production, saying "we can't handle it all." This year, we educated cadres to look ahead in everything, affirming that "more land and less labor" is a favorable condition for developing production. In fact, as long as the work is arranged well, more land can be managed. It should be said that this is a good thing. In the past few years, we have deeply realized in leading agricultural production that all work should be grasped "early" to gain the initiative. Early start, early success. One setback, many setbacks. This year, we prepared for deep plowing and autumn planting work early: we made deep plowing and autumn planting plans at the end of June, convened an autumn planting meeting in July, specifically formulated plans and measures, proposed specific times, tasks, and requirements, fully mobilized the masses to deliberate and discuss, made full ideological preparations, and prepared materials and technology in advance. More than 30,000 blacksmiths and carpenters were organized throughout the county to rush to make and reform a large number of deep plowing tools, more than 50,000 technicians were trained, and improved varieties were carefully selected. Because the work that could be done early was done early, staggering the time, the contradiction of insufficient labor was resolved. Therefore, the county's 1.8 million mu of autumn planting area was completed in half a month, more than half a month earlier than last year. In terms of water conservancy construction, we drew up a special team for planning during the drought resistance period, and combined drought resistance with ideological mobilization for water conservancy construction, making everyone ideologically prepared for water conservancy construction. At the beginning of autumn plowing, we held a water conservancy meeting and drew out the water conservancy leadership team. In this way, one task is connected to another, so that the masses are ideologically and materially prepared before each task.

Anti-Rightist Campaign and Large-Scale Mass Movement

When deep plowing the land, due to the prolonged drought, the land was dry, hard, and cracked, some people said that deep plowing was "wasting manpower and money." Some people not only opposed deep plowing, but also opposed strip planting and close planting, attacking the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. A few cadres also had a fear of difficulty, wanting to wait for rain before deep plowing. Some people believed that "deep plowing is possible on river land, but not on upland." In response to these ideas, we launched socialist and general line education throughout the county, carrying out ideological mobilization at all levels. At the beginning of deep plowing, the county convened a meeting of more than 20,000 cadres above the level of small team leader in the form of communes; during winter sowing, mass meetings of more than 200,000 people and broadcast meetings of 400,000 people were held in the form of communes and management areas. These meetings took "thinking about the past, looking at the present, and looking forward to the future" as the content, and carried out mass debates on "Can we deep plow when the weather is dry and the land is hard?", calculated the seasonal accounts, the increase and decrease accounts of strip planting and close planting versus broadcasting and sparse planting, and carried out a great debate based on the agricultural "Eight-Point Charter." A total of 400,000 big-character posters were posted throughout the county. Through debates and big-character posters, right-leaning conservative ideas were criticized, and the sabotage activities of the five categories of elements (landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists) were exposed and cracked down upon. The socialist awareness of the broad masses was raised and their enthusiasm was aroused. Everyone agreed that the dry weather and hard land are not as hard as our determination. As long as we show the energy of making steel in a big way and building water conservancy in a big way, even the most difficult problems can be solved. Those who believed that deep plowing was possible on river land but not on upland, and those who thought it was still early in the season, admitted defeat in the face of facts and admitted that they had conservative ideas. Thus, the deep plowing and autumn planting movement quickly unfolded. The number of laborers participating in deep plowing increased from 110,000 to 180,000, the number of plowing cattle increased from 15,000 to 40,000, and the daily progress increased from 30,000 mu to 60,000 mu.

Organize Large-Scale Corps Operations

If the ideological problems of the masses are solved and the soaring enthusiasm is aroused, a strict organization is essential. The past management methods of the small-scale peasant economy and the leadership methods of the small cooperative are no longer suitable for the development requirements of the situation. For example, to build water conservancy projects, roads, reclaim wasteland, and carry out agricultural capital construction, several sets of gongs and drums are beaten together. It is impossible to complete millions of cubic meters of earthwork, reclaim hundreds of thousands of mu of wasteland, and repair dozens of roads in a very short period of time with the power of small collectives. We analyzed these characteristics and realized that only by giving full play to the superiority of the people's commune, engaging in large-scale cooperation, and engaging in large-scale corps operations can these tasks be completed simultaneously. The method of fragmented work is no longer suitable for the requirements of current work. However, large-scale corps operations must be well organized, otherwise a chaotic army will be defeated. We have learned that the following tasks must be done well:

First, comprehensive planning and comprehensive arrangements. For a period of tasks or a piece of work, or a project, we must first make plans in advance based on time, labor, tasks, and requirements, and hold cadre meetings to explain the specific requirements clearly. Difficulties that need to be solved should be prepared in advance. Don't fight unprepared battles. During the previous stage of deep plowing and sowing, in order to focus on the central work, we implemented the "five concentrations" of leadership, labor, tools, time, and work, and arranged for the work that could be combined at the same time, such as deep plowing combined with land leveling, deep plowing combined with wasteland reclamation, land leveling combined with road construction, garden cultivation, land transformation, water conservancy construction, and combined with manure accumulation. In terms of methods, the main task is to arrange labor, make labor quotas, assign tasks specifically, and assign leadership responsibilities. From the county to the production team, there are three teams: one team leads with deep plowing and autumn planting as the center, combined with land consolidation, garden cultivation, wasteland reclamation, land transformation, and road construction; one team leads water conservancy combined with manure accumulation; and one team leads autumn harvest and grain and cotton procurement, distribution, and diversified operations and sideline production. In each work link, we must also distinguish between primary and secondary, urgent and slow, and adopt a method of attacking one link after another, focusing on completing a main task, and driving other work simultaneously, so that various tasks can be done well at the same time while ensuring the center is done well.

Second, solve the mutual benefit of cooperative units and the work point compensation of commune members. In terms of specific practices, the scope of cooperation should generally be arranged according to the degree of work, project, task, and requirements: seasonal agricultural tasks such as deep plowing, autumn planting, and harvesting are suitable for cooperation within the scope of the production team; water conservancy construction, road construction, wasteland reclamation, and other basic construction projects should not exceed the scope of a management area as much as possible. Even cooperation between communes should be divided into leadership units by management area, and production teams should be used as combat units, assigning tasks according to labor and time. In terms of mutual benefit, communes and teams should adopt the methods of borrowing and repaying labor and apportioning labor according to the amount of labor and the size of the benefit, with more being returned and less being supplemented. Specifically to the issue of mutual benefit for commune members, the main task is to do a good job in labor quotas. Group contracts can be adopted to assign tasks according to the strength of labor, and implement the principle of more work, more pay. When cooperating, whether it is cooperation between small teams, production teams, or communes, attention should also be paid to taking care of the production of the unit to prevent losing sight of the other.

Third, strengthen labor organization and management to prevent chaotic armies from fighting. Before the migrant workers set off, they must first reorganize the team and equip it with appropriate cadres. Generally, the original production team is used as a unit to establish party and youth league branches in order to play a backbone role in the work. Before large-scale corps operations, a series of preparations must be made, such as arranging food and accommodation.

Fourth, vigorously carry out tool reforms and launch a high-efficiency movement. When deep plowing the land, mobilize "red furnaces" to go to the countryside to repair plows and harrows on the construction site, so that repairs can be done as soon as they break down. Last year, during the large-scale water conservancy construction, mechanization was basically achieved, shoulder carrying was eliminated, and work efficiency was increased by more than double.

Fifth, pay attention to the lives of the masses. The heavier the task, the more attention should be paid to the rest of the migrant workers. The key to doing this work well is that cadres should be "five together" with the masses: eat together, sleep together, work together, entertain together, and study together. Only in this way can the morale of the masses be high, the enthusiasm can be lasting, and the work efficiency can be higher.

Establish Benchmarks and Launch Competitions

In order to lead the production movement to continue to move forward, the county launched internal and external competitions. Externally, the slogan "Learn from Xiangyang, catch up with Sui County, and strive to earn the whole year in the summer harvest season" was put forward to mobilize the masses, catch up with Xiangyang's land area, catch up with Sui County's paddy field area, and launch the movement to "learn from Gao Huatang and learn from Li Dagui" in terms of mountain and water management. Within the county, competitions were launched between communes, management areas, teams, small teams, and individuals. In each production link, inspections and evaluations are continuously carried out, achievements are summarized, and the movement to "learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced" is launched. During the deep plowing movement, the progress of the Taiping and Yangdang communes was fast and the quality was good. At that time, more than 400 cadres and "cattle experts" from the county were organized to visit the site, and the "learn, catch up, and surpass" movement was launched throughout the county. After visiting the cadres and commune members of the Lutou Commune, a major inspection of the quality of deep plowing was carried out. More than 6,000 mu of plowed land was unqualified and was processed and replowed in time.

In order to make the movement continue to move forward, evaluations and commendations were also continuously carried out in each production link, overcoming the slack mood, and making production wave after wave. After the winter sowing was completed, more than 21,000 models were selected throughout the county, including more than 5,700 cadres.

    枣阳县怎样掀起全面生产高潮？
    中共枣阳县委第一书记　孙建修
    一切向前看　一切早打算
    枣阳县土地多劳力少。过去，部分干部群众却把这个发展生产的有利条件当作困难，当作生产落后的借口，说什么“干不过来”。今年我们教育干部一切向前看，肯定了“地多劳力少”是发展生产的有利条件。事实上，只要把活路安排好，地多也搞得过来，应该说这是好事。几年来，我们在领导农业生产上深刻地体会到：一切工作要抓“早”，争取主动。一早百早，一顺百顺，一被动百被动。今年深翻秋播工作我们提早作好了各项准备：6月底就作了深耕秋播规划，7月份召开了秋播会议，具体地制订了规划与措施，提出了具体时间、任务、要求，全面发动群众酝酿讨论，作了充分的思想准备，并提前作好了物资、技术准备，全县组织铁木匠三万多人，提早赶制和改制大量深耕工具，训练技术员五万多人，以及精选良种等。由于把能提早做的活路提早做完，错开了时间，从而解决了劳力不足的矛盾。因而全县一百八十万亩秋播面积，半月时间就结束了，比去年提前半个多月。在兴修水利方面，我们在抗旱时就抽出专门班子进行规划，同时结合抗旱，进行修水利的思想发动，边抗旱边规划，作到人人做好修水利的思想准备。秋耕开始，我们就召开了水利会议，把水利领导班子拉开了。这样，使一个工作一个工作衔接起来，使群众在每一个工作之前都有思想和物资准备。
    反右倾大搞群众运动
    深耕土地时，由于久旱不雨，土地干硬发裂，有些人说搞深耕是“劳民伤财”。有些人不仅反对深耕，还反对条播密植，攻击农业“八字宪法”。少数干部也存在着畏难情绪，想等下雨后再深耕。有人则认为“河地能深耕，岗地不行”。针对这些思想，我们在全县展开了社会主义、总路线教育，层层进行思想发动。在深耕开始时，全县以公社为单位召开了两万多名小队长以上的干部大会；在冬播时又以公社、管理区为单位召开了二十多万人的群众大会和四十万人的广播大会。这些会议以“想过去，看现在，望将来”为内容，开展群众性的“天干地硬能不能深耕？”的大辩论，算了季节账、条播密植和撒播稀植增减产账，以及按农业“八字宪法”为内容开展了大鸣大放，全县共贴出大字报四十万张。通过大辩论、大字报，批判了右倾保守思想，揭发和打击了地、富、反、坏、右五类分子的破坏活动。提高了广大群众的社会主义觉悟，鼓起了干劲。大家一致认为，天旱地硬没有我们决心硬，只要拿出大办钢铁、大搞水利的劲头，再困难的问题也可以解决。那些认为河地能深耕，岗地不能深耕，以及认为季节还早的人，在事实面前认输了，承认自己有保守思想，于是深耕秋播运动很快就开展起来。全县参加深耕劳力由十一万人增加到十八万人，耕牛由一万五千犋增加到四万犋，日进度由三万亩增加到六万亩。
    组织大兵团作战
    群众思想问题解决了，冲天干劲鼓起来了，没有严密的组织是不行的；还用过去小农经济的经营方式和小社的领导方法，也是不适合形势发展要求的。如修水利、修公路、开荒、搞农业基本建设，几套锣鼓一起打，在很短时间内同时完成几百万方土、开荒几十万亩、修好几十条公路，小集体力量无论如何是办不到的。我们分析了这些特点，只有充分发挥人民公社的优越性，搞大协作、搞大兵团作战，才能同时完成这些任务，那种零打碎敲的方法已不能适合当前工作的要求。但是，大兵团作战一定要作好严密的组织工作，不然就会乱兵上阵打败仗。我们体会到必须做好以下几项工作：
    第一、全面规划，全面安排。一个时期的任务或一件工作，或者一个工程，首先必须根据时间、劳力、任务、要求，提前作好规划，开好干部会，将具体要求交代清楚，需要解决的困难提前作好，不打无准备的仗。在前一段深耕播种时，为了突击中心工作，我们贯彻执行了领导、劳力、工具、时间、活路“五集中”，并将能结合的活路同时安排好，如深耕结合平整土地，深耕结合开荒，平整土地结合修公路、搞园田化、改田、兴修水利和结合积肥等。在方法上主要作好劳力安排，搞好劳动定额，任务交待具体，领导分工负责。从县到生产队共分三个班子，一个班子领导以深耕秋播为中心，结合土地连片、园田化、开荒、改田、修公路；一个班子领导水利结合积肥；一个班子领导秋收和粮棉收购，分配和多种经营、副业生产。并在每一个工作环节上，也要分清主次缓急，采取一环套一环突击的方法，集中完成一个主要任务，结合带动其他工作，使各项工作在搞好中心的前提下，同时搞好。
    第二、解决好协作单位的互利和社员的工分报酬问题。在具体作法上，一般的应根据活路、工程、任务、要求的程度来安排协作范围：深耕、秋种、收获等季节性的农活，以生产队为范围协作为适宜；修水利、修公路、开荒和其他基本建设等，尽量不要超出一个管理区的范围，就是公社与公社之间的协作，也要以管理区划分领导单位，以生产队为作战单位，按劳力、按时间分配任务。在互利上，社与社、队与队应根据劳力多少、受益大小，采取借工还工和按劳摊兑、多退少补。具体到社员的互利问题，主要把劳动定额搞好，可以采取小组承包，按劳力强弱分配任务，实行多劳多得。在协作时，不论小队之间、生产队之间或公社之间的协作，同样要注意照顾本单位的生产，防止顾此失彼。
    第三、加强劳动组织管理，防止乱兵上阵。民工在出发之前，首先将队伍整编好，配备适当干部，一般以原生产队为单位，成立党团支部，以便发挥工作中的骨干作用。大兵团作战之前，必须做好一系列的准备工作，如安排食宿等。
    第四、大搞工具改革，开展高工效运动。深耕土地时，发动“红炉”下乡，到工地修整犁耙，作到随坏随修。去年大修水利时，基本实现了车子化，消灭了肩挑，提高工效一倍以上。
    第五、注意群众生活。任务越重越要注意民工的休息，作好这个工作的重要关键，是干部要和群众“五同”：同吃、同睡、同劳动、同娱乐、同学习。只有这样，群众情绪才能饱满，干劲才能持久，工效才能更高。
    树标兵　开展竞赛
    为了领导生产运动不断地向前发展，全县开展了内外线竞赛。对外提出了“学襄阳，赶随县，争取夏收一季捞全年”的口号，发动群众，赶襄阳的土地面积，赶随县的水田面积，在治山治水方面，开展“学习高华堂，学习李大贵”运动。在县内，展开公社与公社、管理区与管理区、队与队、小队与小队、人与人之间的竞赛。在每个生产环节中，不断检查评比，总结成绩，开展“学先进、赶先进、超先进”运动。在深耕运动中，太平、杨垱两个公社的进度快、质量好，当时就组织全县四百多个干部和“牛把式”到现场参观，在全县范围内开展“学、赶、超”运动。鹿头公社干部和社员参观后，进行了深耕质量大检查，六千多亩翻耕地不合格，及时加工补耕。
    为了使运动继续向前发展，在每个生产环节中，还不断地进行了评功表模，克服了松气情绪，使生产一浪高一浪。全县在冬播结束后，共评选出模范二万一千多人，其中有干部五千七百多人。
