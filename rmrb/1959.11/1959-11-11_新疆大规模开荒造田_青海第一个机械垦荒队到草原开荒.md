Xinhua News Agency report:

    Xinjiang is experiencing a surge in large-scale land reclamation. By October 25th, the area of reclaimed land reached 3.63 million mu. Cadres and members of all ethnic groups, along with workers of the Production and Construction Corps, are advancing at a rate of approximately 40,000 mu per day.
    In the land reclamation movement, the Production and Construction Corps is taking the lead. A socialist labor competition centered on completing land reclamation plans, ensuring quality, and reducing costs has been launched between various farms, and between teams within the farms. The entire Corps has newly established 19 large-scale mechanized farms in areas such as Tarim, Tacheng, Emin, Jinghe, Bole, and Altay, and is actively engaged in land reclamation. People's Communes are also reclaiming large areas of land. Communes generally focus on reclaiming small plots of wasteland within farmland and wasteland near farmland. This allows for the utilization of existing irrigation channels, saving labor and water, while also facilitating land planning and contiguous land use. The land reclamation professional teams of various communes are simultaneously reclaiming and sowing, having already sown over 2 million mu of winter wheat on the newly reclaimed land.
    In preparation for the opening of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, areas along the railway have reclaimed 1.49 million mu by October 25th.
    Xinjiang has over 160 million mu of arable wasteland, which is more than five times the existing cultivated land area. Due to land reclamation, the cultivated land area in 1958 had already increased by 18.06 million mu compared to the early post-liberation period.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining:

    The first mechanized land reclamation team organized in Qinghai Province has set out to reclaim land on the grasslands of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. They are determined to complete the task of reclaiming 100,000 mu this year.
    This land reclamation team has 86 tractors, consisting of over 400 tractor drivers, repairmen, and corresponding management personnel. At the establishment of the land reclamation team and the swearing-in ceremony, Gao Feng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Yuan Renyuan, Governor of the province, attended and delivered speeches.
    Agricultural production in Qinghai Province has developed rapidly since liberation. In a few years, the province's sown area has expanded by 50% compared to the time of liberation, and the yield per unit area of food crops has also increased by about one and a half times. In order to further develop agriculture at a high speed and adapt to the rapid progress of various construction undertakings in Qinghai, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee has proposed to not only vigorously increase the yield per unit area, but also to further vigorously reclaim wasteland and expand the cultivated land area. At present, more than 150,000 laborers in the province have been invested in the mass land reclamation movement, and more than 1 million mu of wasteland has been reclaimed.
    Qinghai Province's more than 30 million mu of reclaimable wasteland is located in sparsely populated pastoral areas. These wastelands have flat terrain and fertile soil.

    新疆大规模开荒造田
    青海第一个机械垦荒队到草原开荒
    据新华社讯　新疆维吾尔自治区已出现一个突击开荒造田的高潮。到10月25日，各地开荒面积已达三百六十三万亩。各族社员和生产建设兵团职工正以平均每天开荒造田四万亩左右的速度前进。
    在开荒造田运动中，生产建设兵团一马当先。各农场之间，场内队与队之间掀起了一个以比完成开荒计划、比质量、比降低造价为中心内容的社会主义劳动竞赛。全兵团已经分别在塔里木、塔城、额敏、精河、博乐和阿勒泰等地新建了十九个大型机械化农场，正在积极垦荒造田。人民公社也在大量开荒造田。公社一般以开垦农田以内的小片荒地和农田附近的荒地为主，这样可以利用旧有渠道灌溉，省工省水，同时也便于土地规划和土地连片。各公社的开荒专业队，边开荒边播种，已在新开的荒地上播种冬麦二百多万亩。
    为了迎接兰新铁路的通车，铁路沿线地区到10月25日已开荒一百四十九万亩。
    新疆维吾尔自治区境内拥有可耕荒地一亿六千多万亩，相当于现有耕地面积的五倍多。由于开垦荒地，1958年的耕地面积已比解放初期增长一千八百零六万亩。
    据新华社西宁讯　青海省组成的第一个机械垦荒队，已出发到海南藏族自治州草原上开荒。他们决心今年完成十万亩垦荒任务。
    这个垦荒队拥有八十六台拖拉机，由四百多名拖拉机手、修理工以及相应的管理人员组成。在垦荒队的成立和誓师大会上，省委第一书记高峰，省长袁任远等都到会祝贺并讲了话。
    青海省解放以来农业生产发展很快。几年全省播种面积比解放时扩大50％；粮食作物单位面积产量也提高了一倍半左右。为了进一步高速度地发展农业，适应青海地区各项建设事业的突飞猛进，中共青海省委提出既要大力提高单位面积产量，又要进一步大力垦荒，扩大耕地面积。目前，全省已有十五万多劳动力投入群众性的垦荒造田运动，已开垦出了一百多万亩荒地。
    青海省的三千多万亩可垦荒地都在人烟稀少的牧业区，这些荒地地势平坦，土壤肥沃。
