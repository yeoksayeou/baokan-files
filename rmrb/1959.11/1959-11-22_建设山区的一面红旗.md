A Red Banner in Mountain Construction
By our correspondents Xiao Ming and Gao Yibing

In September of this year, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation, the Changshi People’s Commune in Dafang County, while summarizing its achievements over the past decade, selected twenty heroic models who had shown utter devotion and made remarkable contributions to the Party, the country, and the people of Changshi during the ten years of construction. The first among these twenty heroic models is Comrade Xue Juming, the Party Secretary of the Changshi Commune Committee.

On October 8, 1950, Comrade Xue Juming led six cadres and a work team of thirty-six people to the Changshi area, which was plagued by tens of thousands of bandits. They mobilized the masses, penetrated the bandits’ lairs, and assisted the troops in completely annihilating the bandits in less than half a year.

With the bandits eliminated, the people of Changshi began a peaceful life. Comrade Xue Juming, a native of Shandong, was not yet accustomed to life in Guizhou. However, the lofty morality and sense of responsibility of a Communist Party member to serve the people, and the sight of the people of Changshi in their paper clothes and living in semi-starvation, inspired him to establish the ambitious goal of changing the face of this mountainous area. He would work with the people of Changshi to build the Changshi mountains. For ten years, he lived and labored alongside the people of Changshi, working tirelessly, day after day, firmly planting the red banner of mountain construction in Guizhou in Changshi Mountain. His deeds, like a red thread, run through the history of the construction of the people of Changshi.

Opening the "Underground River"

"Changshi is a village, no one cares if you die of thirst." The most pressing need for Changshi was water, but Changshi was not without water. When the night was deep and quiet, if you put your ear to the ground, you could clearly hear the sound of flowing water. For thousands of years, countless underground rivers crisscrossed the belly of Changshi Mountain. Despite countless droughts that left the land barren, not a drop was used.

Comrade Xue Juming wanted to break this thousand-year-old tradition and make the underground river serve the people of Changshi. To find the key to opening the underground river, he tirelessly climbed high mountains and walked through deep valleys. He was the first to use a rope to lower himself into the Guoquan Cave, which was rumored to be haunted by demons and ghosts and was avoided by everyone. When the district committee decided to build the Guoquan Cave water conservancy project, some landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements did everything they could to sabotage it, spreading a large number of fallacies, disrupting the morale of the masses, and mocking Comrade Xue Juming. But no matter how they sabotaged and ridiculed, they could not shake the district committee’s determination to lead the masses in building water conservancy projects. At a meeting of Party members, Youth League members, and activists, Comrade Xue Juming declared loudly: If we do not build good water conservancy for the people of Changshi and do not enable the people of Changshi to eat rice, we will never give up.

After a major debate on October 1, 1952, the arduous water conservancy project of Guoquan Cave began. The district committee set up an office at the construction site, and Comrade Xue Juming stayed there day and night. This arduous project, which required the construction of flumes from cliffs more than twenty zhang high, employed more than 120,000 workers, with no rework and no casualties. The project was completed in the spring of the following year. On February 2, 1953, Changshi held a water release ceremony. Water! It crossed the hillsides, flowed through the fields, and meandered around the houses of thousands of families. People greeted this stream with tears in their eyes. This stream attracted tens of thousands of people from seventeen districts, the neighboring counties of Bijie and Jinsha, and Gulin County in neighboring Sichuan Province, all of whom came to visit. Many people who had fled the famine also moved back one after another. Many people from other villages fell in love with this stream and repeatedly asked to move to Changshi. From this year on, Changshi District would carry out large-scale water conservancy projects every winter. Almost every cold winter, Party members, Youth League members, and activists spent their time on water conservancy construction sites. By the summer of 1958, thousands of water conservancy projects of all sizes had been built in the district, irrigating nearly 30,000 mu of land. After communization last year, many limitations of the advanced cooperatives were eliminated. In five months, the Guantian and Xin'yuan reservoirs were built, irrigating an area equal to the total of the previous thousands of water conservancy projects, basically solving the problem of agricultural water use, and enabling the Changshi Commune to survive the severe drought of more than seventy days without rain this year.

Two Corn Plants and Tens of Thousands of Mu of Fertile Land

While most of the district was immersed in joy, Xue Juming's heart was again tied to Shanba Township. Having grown up on the plains of Shandong, he was heartbroken to see that the tens of thousands of mu of dams in Shanba Township were not growing crops. He traveled throughout Shanba, visiting the masses everywhere. One day, he unexpectedly found two corn plants growing on the ground in front of Jiang Fangcheng's house. Why did corn grow here? He stood and looked, squatted and looked, looked sideways, and looked straight. He grabbed a handful of soil and put it on his tongue, then went to a distance to grab some soil and put it on his tongue. He said to the masses surrounding him, "This soil is a bit numb, and that soil is a bit sour." After discussing with several people, they concluded that it might be that the lime that had fallen from the wall had changed the properties of the acidic soil, and that someone had been feeding livestock here and corn kernels had fallen. In order to gain experience, Comrade Xue Juming encouraged activist Li Sihan to reclaim some wasteland and sow lime to grow corn. Li Sihan reclaimed one mu of land, sowed two thousand catties of lime, and harvested two hundred catties of corn in the autumn. This ended the history of Shanba not growing crops. In 1954, Shanba Township launched a wave of reclamation and soil improvement. Now Shanba has four thousand mu of fertile land, and nearly 20,000 mu of this severely acidic soil has been improved throughout the district.

Barren Mountains Transformed into Fruitful Forests, Grasslands Covered with Cattle and Sheep

Changshi District gradually changed from a grain-deficient area to a surplus-grain area. The people of Changshi were able to eat rice, and they had single layers in summer and cotton clothes in winter. However, Xue Juming was never satisfied. In his mind, he unfolded even more magnificent and brilliant plans. In that year, the Changshi District Committee, in accordance with the Party's comprehensive development of the mountain economy construction policy, conducted a comprehensive plan for the entire district. District committee cadres traveled all over the 888 mountains in the district, more than 300 of which were personally surveyed by Comrade Xue Juming. When the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants in the district were excited about the grand plan put forward by the district committee to plant trees and develop animal husbandry, a group of short-sighted rich middle peasants and cadres influenced by the ideology of rich middle peasants voiced another argument. They said: "We have been working on water conservancy for several years, it's time for us to take two winters off." "Developing forestry cannot be seen quickly, and there are difficulties in financing animal husbandry." "Even ghosts and gods are old when temples are built, it is better to live a comfortable life in front of us." For a considerable period of time thereafter, with the gains, losses, successes, and failures of various constructions, this group of people was sometimes silent, sometimes opposed, and sometimes chattering endlessly and aggressively. When this group of people saw that the livestock farm jointly reclaimed by the four primary agricultural cooperatives in Changshi Township had lost more than 300 of the 500 sheep it had bought due to lack of breeding experience, they shouted: "How can cattle and sheep be raised in Changshi?" When they saw that the advanced agricultural cooperative allocated funds to purchase citrus seedlings, they sarcastically said: "Taking so much money to buy citrus seedlings is like throwing a meat bun to a dog and never getting it back. It is better to buy citrus and divide it among us to eat a sweet mouth." When they saw the advanced agricultural cooperative buying fine-wool sheep from Xinjiang, they angrily said: "The money is being taken by these little cubs to play with." There were also intellectuals who came to Changshi to visit and, after seeing the large-scale construction in Changshi, said disapprovingly: You have so much basic construction, but your housing is still mostly thatched houses rather than tiled houses.

Comrade Xue Juming calmly responded to these taunts, shouts, and questions. He convened a meeting of district and township cadres to study and analyze the essence of these strange arguments – the struggle between two roads – and firmly said to the cadres: "We cannot eat and wear all of our income. We must support the socialist construction of the country, live a better life, and think about future generations. If we mountainous people do not spend some effort and some money to carry out mountain construction, we will fall behind in socialist construction." The district committee also launched a mass publicity campaign throughout the district to build the mountainous area, encouraging activists to continue to work hard and diligently, and to learn from failures. By calculating the detailed accounts, the enthusiasm of the people in the whole district for developing a variety of mountain economies was greatly enhanced. Party members, Youth League members, and activists, young girls and young men, took the lead in the movement to "turn barren mountains and bare mountains into golden mountains and silver mountains, and let barren hills and grasslands be covered with cattle and sheep." People answered those scoffers with righteous indignation: Everything is difficult in the beginning, and there is experience in failure. We are not afraid of not being able to invite the Bodhisattva once the temple is built. To those few visitors who were "concerned about the people," people answered even more simply: "If you have chickens, you are not afraid of not having eggs. Tiled houses cannot lay 'eggs.' Mountain forests and pastures are the nests for 'eggs'." In short, people's revolutionary spirit that pierced the sky overcame the evil winds and launched an arduous struggle to change the face of the mountains and rivers.

The Victory of Thriftily Building the Mountains

The people of Changshi firmly adopted the policy of saving on food and spending money for construction, eating fewer eggs and hatching more chickens. This policy has been victorious, and the onlookers have conceded defeat. Today, the commune has a huge family fortune. Three hundred sheep have become 3,300, thirty boxes of bees have become 200 boxes, and the original pasture worth 4,000 yuan is now worth more than 40,000. Some of the fruit tree seedlings planted that year have already blossomed and borne fruit, and the tea forests planted that year have yielded 60,000 to 70,000 catties of tea. The commune has successively established as many as 24 large-scale pastures and forest farms. The afforestation area has reached 180,000 mu. The banks of the Wuxi River, which are more than 70 kilometers long, are planted with tung trees, and the mountain roads along Changyan, which are more than 30 kilometers long, are planted with lacquer trees. There are also tens of thousands of mu of pine, fir, and cypress timber forests. After communization, 10,000 mu of tea mountains, 10,000 mu of fruit forests, 10,000 mu of walnut forests, and 10,000 mu of lacquer tree forests were built. Last year, the newly built reservoir stocked 550,000 fish, as well as iron factories, sulfur factories, and fertilizer factories, and so on. There are really too many to count and too many to see. As for those pasture breeders and fruit forest planters who were ridiculed in the past, they have now become the commune's local experts and innovators. Last year, the Changshi Commune had an income of more than 1.14 million yuan from forestry, animal husbandry, industry, etc., and this year it will have even more income. Each management area in the commune has established brick and tile factories. The Changshi management area alone has burned more than one million bricks and tiles. The Changshi Commune has bricks and tiles, wood, a large number of technical workers, and labor has been freed up, and there is a certain amount of capital accumulation. What is so difficult about building houses!

    建设山区的一面红旗
    本报记者　萧明　高忆冰
    今年9月，大方县长石人民公社为迎接建国十周年，在总结十年成就的同时，评选出二十名在十年建设中为党、为国、为长石人民赤胆忠心、卓著功勋的英雄模范。这二十名英雄模范中的第一名，就是中共长石公社党委书记——薛巨明同志。
    1950年10月8日，薛巨明同志带领六名干部和一个武工队，共三十六人来到窝聚着数万土匪的长石区，发动群众，深入匪穴，协助部队在不到半年的时间内全歼土匪。
    土匪歼灭了，长石人民开始了和平生活。薛巨明同志是山东人，这时他还不习惯贵州生活。但是，共产党员为人民服务的崇高的道德和责任感、长石人民身上的纸衣服和半饥半饱的生活，激励着他树立了改变这个山区面貌的雄心大志。他要和长石人民一起建设长石山区。十年来，他和长石人民生活在一起，劳动在一起，十年如一日地工作着，把贵州山区建设中的红旗，牢牢地插在长石山。他的事迹像一条红线一样，贯穿在长石人民的建设史中。
              打开了“阴河水”
    “长石是个屯，渴死无人问”，长石最迫切需要的就是水，但是，长石并不是没有水。当夜深人静时，把耳朵贴在地皮上，就会清晰地听见哗哗的流水声。千万年来，无数条阴河水交织在长石山的腹部，尽管这里曾无数次被旱得颗粒无收，却滴水不为所用。
    薛巨明同志想打破这千万年的陈规，要阴河水为长石人民服务。为了寻找打开阴河水的钥匙，他曾经不知疲倦地爬高山、走深谷。他第一个用绳索把自己吊进被传说中的妖魔鬼怪吓得无人敢靠近的锅圈洞探险。当区委会决定要兴修锅圈洞水利工程时，一些地、富、反、坏分子，极尽其破坏能事，放出大量谬论，涣散群众情绪，嘲讽薛巨明同志。但无论怎样破坏和嘲讽，都动摇不了区委会领导群众兴修水利的决心。在一次党团员积极分子会议上，薛巨明同志响亮地提出：不给长石人民修好水利，不叫长石人民吃上大米，我们决不罢休。
    1952年10月1日一场大辩论后，开始建设锅圈洞的艰险水利工程，工地成立了区委会的办公处，薛巨明同志日夜守在工地上。这个要从二十多丈高的悬岩上架设枧槽的艰险工程，用工十二万多，没有返工，没有伤亡一个人。翌年春天工程竣工了。1953年2月2日，长石举行放水典礼。水呵！越过山坡、淌过田野、绕过千家百户屋前房后。人们热泪盈眶地迎着这股水。这股水吸引了方圆十七个区，邻县毕节、金沙及邻省四川古蔺县的万千群众，都纷纷赶来参观。好多逃荒在外的人也陆续搬了回来。许多外乡人爱上了这股流水，三番两次的要求迁居长石。从这一年开始，长石区年年冬季都要大修水利，党团员积极分子差不多每一个严寒冬季，都是在水利工地上度过的。到1958年夏季，全区已修成大大小小成千处水利，灌溉面积近三万亩。去年公社化以后，排除了高级社时的许多局限，用五个月的时间，修成了官田、新沅两个水库，灌溉面积等于前几年上千处水利的总和，基本上解决了农田用水，使长石公社在今年闯过了七十多天无雨的大旱关。
          两棵包谷和万亩良田
    正在全区大部分地区都沉浸在一片欢乐里的时候，薛巨明的心，又拴在山坝乡了。在山东平原上长大的他，看见山坝乡这上万亩的大坝子不长庄稼，十分痛心。他跑遍了整个山坝，四处访问群众。一天，他意外的发现江方成家房子挡头地上长着两棵包谷。这里为什么长出包谷？他站着看，蹲着看，斜看，顺看。抓了一点土放到舌头上，又到远处去抓点土放到舌头上。他向围着他的群众说，“这个土有点麻嘴，那个土有些酸”。他和几个群众研究的结果：可能是墙头掉下的石灰改变了酸性土壤的性能，这里有人喂牲口，掉下包谷粒。为取得经验，薛巨明同志鼓励积极分子李司汉开点荒，撒上石灰种包谷。李司汉开了一亩地，撒了二千斤石灰，秋收时收得二百斤包谷。从此结束了山坝不长庄稼的历史。1954年，山坝乡掀起了开荒改良土壤的热潮。现在山坝已经有了四千亩良田，全区改良的这种重酸性土壤有近二万亩。
            荒山成果林　草地遍牛羊
    长石区由缺粮区渐渐变为余粮区了。长石人民吃上了大米，长石人民夏有单、冬有棉。但是，薛巨明永无满足之日，他的脑子里，又展开了更加辉煌灿烂的宏图大志。就在这一年里，长石区委根据党的全面发展山区经济建设方针，对全区进行了全面规划，区委干部跑遍了全区八百八十八个山头，其中有三百多是薛巨明同志亲自勘察的。当全区广大贫农和下中农正为区委所提出的广植林木，发展畜牧业的宏伟规划兴奋时，却有一部分鼠目寸光的富裕中农以及受富裕中农思想影响的干部，发出了另外的论调。他们说：“水利闹了好几年，该叫我们歇上两个冬天啦。”“发展林业不能吹糠见米，搞畜牧业资金有困难。”“修起庙来鬼神都老了，还不如眼前过点安逸日子。”在以后相当长的时间里，随着各项建设的得、失、胜、败，这伙人时而沉默，时而反对，时而喋喋不休，咄咄逼人。这伙人看见长石乡四个初级农业社合作开垦的畜牧场，由于缺乏饲养经验，买来的五百只羊死得剩下三百多只时，就大叫大嚷说：“长石这地方哪能放牛羊”。他们看到高级农业社拨出资金购买柑秧时，就冷嘲热讽地说：“拿这么多钱买柑秧，是肉包子打狗一去不回，不如买柑子分给我们吃甜甜口”。他们看到高级农业社买来新疆细毛羊，气愤地说：“钱叫这些小崽子拿去闹着玩”。还有到长石参观的知识分子，看了长石规模宏大的建设以后，不以为然地说：你们的基本建设搞得这样多，可是你们的住房还是草房多于瓦房呵。
    薛巨明同志在这些嘲讽、叫嚷、质问面前沉着应战。他召集区、乡干部会议，研究和分析这些奇怪论调的实质——两条道路的斗争，坚定地向干部们说：“我们不能把全部收入都吃光穿光，我们要支援国家社会主义建设，要过更好的生活，要为子孙后代想。我们山区人民，如果不花些力气，花些资金，搞山区建设，我们就要在社会主义建设中落后。”区委会又在全区开展了群众性的建设山区的宣传，鼓励积极分子继续不懈地苦干苦钻，要从失败中找出经验。通过算细账，大大提高了全区人民发展山区多种经济的积极性。党团员和积极分子们，年轻的姑娘和小伙子们，首先带头投入了“变荒山童山为金山银山，让荒坡草地遍布牛羊”的运动。人们理直气壮地回答那些嘲讽者说：凡事开头难，失败中有经验。有了庙还怕请不来菩萨。对于那几位“忧民”的参观者，人们回答得更干脆：“有了鸡不怕没有蛋，瓦房下不了‘蛋’，山林和牧场才是蛋窝窝”。总之，人们气贯长虹的革命气势战胜了歪风邪气，展开了坚苦卓绝的改变山河面貌的斗争。
          勤俭建设山区的胜利
    长石人民坚定地采取了少吃蛋多孵鸡的省吃俭用搞建设的方针。这方针已经取得了胜利，观潮派服输了。而今，公社已有了巨大的家业。三百只羊变成了三千三百只，三十箱蜂变成了二百箱蜂，原来那个价值四千元的牧场，而今值四万还有余，当年栽下去的果树苗，有的已经开花结实，当年营造的茶林，已收茶叶六、七万斤。全公社先后建立的大型牧场、林场，就有二十四个之多。造林面积达十八万亩，沿乌溪河七十多公里的河岸植满了油桐，沿长岩三十多公里山道种满了漆树，还有数万亩松、杉、柏树用材林。公社化后，更建起了万亩茶山、万亩果林、万亩核桃林、万亩漆树林。去年新建的水库放养了五十五万尾鱼，还有铁厂、硫磺厂和化肥厂等等。真是数不胜数，看不胜看。至于那些从前受人嘲笑的牧场饲养员、果林种植者，而今已经成了公社的土专家、革新家。去年，长石公社已从林、牧、工业等收入一百一十四万多元，今年将有更多的收入。全公社每个管理区都建立了砖瓦场，仅长石管理区就已烧好百万以上的砖瓦。长石公社有了砖瓦，有了木材，有了大批技术工人，劳动力腾出了手，又有了一定的资金积累，造房盖屋又有何难！
    薛巨明同志站在山坡上，眺望着远方，他向站在他身旁的同志们说：“我爱长石胜过我的家乡”。（附图片）
