    The Light and Heat of the October Revolution
    Wei Shuming
    I gaze at the pictures of the far side of the moon, reading the names of the newly named mountains and seas, gradually falling into contemplation. Following the swirling thoughts, a picture I have never seen before appears before my eyes: Moscow – a center of light and heat, whose intensity of light and height of heat no one can measure. Around this center, the halo it emits extends in circles, layer upon layer, like the growth rings of pine and cedar, with the continuation of time. This halo first extends to Europe and Asia, and then to the globe; then it extends through artificial satellites and space rockets to high altitudes, to the orbit around the sun, and now it illuminates the far side of the moon. Permeating the heavens and the earth, the stars, sun, and moon are all captured in this shimmering golden halo. Who painted such a beautiful picture?

    Then I thought: If there were humans living on the moon, then the first sign by which they would recognize humans from the outside world would be the flags of socialism and communists. If there were people observing celestial phenomena on the far side of the moon, then the first ray of light they would discover would be the glimmer of light from the October Revolution and socialism.

    This is not a fantasy, but a brilliant reality, which also contains a harsh truth: the influence of socialism, after decades of breaking through the layers of encirclement against it, has now expanded into the universe. Whether people are willing or not, when they look up at the sun and the moon, they cannot avoid a new, radiantly shining planet, inserted with the socialist red flag, floating in their minds. Even if a small handful of people curse this as "expansion," its gradual penetration into people's hearts is irresistible.

    The capitalist system had its golden age, and it also emitted its brilliance in the course of human history. However, history has developed, and the light and heat of capitalism have dissipated. Now all that remains is a corrupt and dying body, struggling on the dark road to death. An unprecedented, radiant, and dazzling newborn giant is advancing in great strides. Thus, the mountains and seas on the far side of the moon now bear the names "Moscow" and "Soviet."

    The continuous and rapid expansion of socialist influence is not due to the advantage of propaganda personnel and tools, but to the brilliance and strength inherent in itself that convinces humanity and history. If you don't believe it, please look: those Western propaganda systems that possess a large number of articulate propaganda personnel and a large number of propaganda tools, besides spreading some rumors and slanders against socialism, can only "stare blankly with nothing to do" in the face of pictures of the far side of the moon, unable to say a word.

    The earth is constantly rotating, and human history is constantly evolving. Only those who master the laws of historical development can be victors. The light of the October Revolution can illuminate the world forever, and the longer the time, the more ardent and brighter it becomes. The reason is that the energy source emitting this light and heat is the people who have mastered the laws of historical development, and their representative, the Communist Party. The energy invested in this light and heat is constantly increasing, becoming more and more abundant, and more and more widespread. The god of death has no pity for the mournful sounds of the dying, and the god of light will not be deceived by the clever words of capitalist shopkeepers. The death of capitalism is legally irreparable.

    When I seemed to hear the bell reporting that the October Revolution had entered its forty-third year, I couldn't help but shout: Oh, the flame of socialism ignited by the October Revolution, burn fiercely, you will eventually burn away the darkness and all the corrupt and stinking things that still exist in this world. At that time, the halo emitted from Moscow as the center of light and heat will illuminate the world of great harmony with doubled brightness – the brilliance of communism.

    十月革命的光和热
    魏曙明
    我凝视着关于月球背面的图片，读着新命名的山和海的名字，渐渐地陷入沉思。顺着思路回旋，眼前便显出一张所未曾见过的图景来：莫斯科——一个光热的中心，谁也无法测量出这光的强度和热的高度。围绕着这个中心，它所发射的光环，顺着时间的延续，一道道，一层层地扩展开来，有似松杉的纹轮。这光环先是扩展到欧洲和亚洲，再就是扩展到全球；接着它又通过人造卫星和宇宙火箭，扩展到高空，到环绕太阳的轨道，到月球上去，如今又照亮了月球的背面。弥漫于天地之间，星辰日月，都网罗于这金光闪闪的光环之中。什么人绘制了这样美的图画？
    于是我想：如果月球上也有人类居住，那末，他们认识外界人类的标志，首先是从社会主义和共产党人的旗帜上认识的。如果月球的背面也有人在观察天象，那末，他们发现的第一道光亮，正是这十月革命和社会主义之光的芒角。
    这并非什么幻想，而是灿烂的现实，其中还包含有严酷的真理：社会主义的影响，几十年来突破对它的层层封裹，如今已经扩大到宇宙中去了。不管人们愿意或是不愿意，当仰望日月的时候，总免不掉一个插有社会主义红旗的光华四射的新星球，在自己脑海里浮动。即使有一小撮人咒骂这是“扩张”也好，它的日渐深入人心，是无法排拒的。
    资本主义制度有过它的黄金时代，在人类历史的行程中，也散发过它的光辉。但是，历史发展了，资本主义的光和热散掉了，如今所剩的只是一个腐败的垂死躯体，在黑暗的死路上挣扎着。一个亘古未有的光华夺目的新生伟人，在大踏步的前进，于是，月球背面的山海，便出现了“莫斯科”、“苏维埃”的名字。
    社会主义影响的不断急剧扩大，并非靠了宣传人员和工具的优势，而是靠了它本身所具有的折服人类和历史的光辉和力量。不信就请看：那些拥有大量能说会道的宣传人员，和拥有大量宣传工具的西方宣传体系，除了对社会主义进行一些造谣、诽谤以外，他们面对着月球背面的图片，却只能“无计可施的呆望着”，连一句话也说不出。
    地球在不停地运转，人类历史在不停地演进，只有驾驭了历史发展规律的人，才能是胜利者。十月革命的光芒，能够永远照耀人间，年代愈久，愈加炽热和明亮，那原因就在发出这光热的能源，正是掌握了历史发展规律的人民，是他们的代表共产党。投入这光热中的能源，随时俱增，愈来愈多，愈广。死神一点也不垂怜将死者的戚戚哀音，光明之神也不会受惑于资本主义市侩们的巧言花语。资本主义的死亡是法定无法挽救的。
    当我仿佛听到了报道十月革命进入了第四十三个年头的钟声的时候，便情不自禁地高呼：由十月革命所点燃的社会主义的火焰啊，你熊熊的燃烧吧，你终将烧尽这世界上尚存的黑暗和一切腐败发臭的东西。那时，以莫斯科为光热中心而发射的光环，将以加倍的光亮——共产主义的光辉照耀着大同的世界。
