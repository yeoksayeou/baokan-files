    Sharp Decline in Farmers' Income
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to a report in the American "Worker's Weekly" on November 8th, the high cost of living in the United States in September set a new record in American history. The extra expenses paid by the American people due to rising food prices have all gone into the pockets of the food processing and sales monopoly groups.
    In the third quarter of 1959 (ending at the end of September), the profits of Safe Companies increased by 13.6% compared with the same period in 1958, General Foods Corporation increased by 19.8%, and Beatrice Foods' profits increased by as much as 20.6%.
    However, in the third quarter of 1959, the income of American farmers from food merchants, food processors, and brokers decreased sharply. In the third quarter of 1959, the income of American farmers was 9.5 billion US dollars, a decrease of 28% compared with the same period in 1958.
    This year's income of American farmers is the lowest since World War II. However, since World War II, American agricultural products have increased by 30%.
    According to the October 16th issue of "U.S. News & World Report," the American agricultural population is decreasing year after year, but the average income of farmers, which was as high as $3,065 in 1958, is estimated to be only $2,476 in 1959.

    农民收入锐减
    本报讯　据11月8日美国“工人周报”报道，9月份美国生活费用的高昂，开创美国有史以来的最高记录。美国人民因为粮价上涨而付出的额外费用，都进入了粮食加工、销售垄断集团的腰包。
    1959年第三季度（以9月底为止）安全商行的利润比1958年同期增加13.6％，通用粮食公司增加19.8％，比亚特里斯粮食公司的利润竟增加20.6％。
    但是，1959年第三季度，美国农民从粮食销售商、粮食加工商、经纪人手中获得的收入却猛烈下降。1959年第三季度，美国农民的收入为九十五亿美元，比1958年同期下降28％。
    美国农民今年的收入，是自从第二次世界大战以来最低的一年。可是从第二次世界大战到现在，美国农产品却增加了30％。
    据10月16日一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”报道，美国农业人口年复一年地减少，但曾在1958年高达三千零六十五美元的农民平均收入，估计到1959年只有二千四百七十六美元。
