Strengthen Winter and Spring Forest Fire Prevention
By Our Commentator
Protecting forests is an important task in our country's forestry construction. The most serious threat to forests is forest fires, which can cause enormous losses if not prevented effectively. Therefore, strengthening forest fire prevention is of great significance.

We have now entered the winter and spring fire season. During this period, the climate is dry, and vegetation is withered, making it extremely prone to forest fires. Especially this year, many areas are experiencing drought; at the same time, with the continued leap forward in production and construction, the number of personnel engaged in production and construction in forest areas has greatly increased, leading to an increase in productive fire use, and the possibility of fires is greater than in previous years. To ensure forest safety and the smooth progress of production and construction in forest areas, it is even more important to strengthen forest fire prevention work.

Under the guidance of the Party's policy of "prevention is better than firefighting" for forest fire prevention, since 1958, the vast forest areas across the country have deeply launched the movement for no forest fires. In the first half of this year, forest fires in the vast majority of regions nationwide were greatly reduced compared to the same period last year. Twenty provinces (regions), including Hunan, Guangdong, Shaanxi, and Jilin, have already produced 566 counties without forest fires. Building on this victory, the broad masses in the Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and southern forest areas have further mobilized and are opening firebreaks and revising fire prevention and forest protection regulations and conventions, filled with confidence in achieving a comprehensive victory in this year's forest fire prevention work. These are all favorable conditions for striving for a complete victory in this year's forest fire prevention work.

However, it should also be pointed out that while great achievements have been made in forest fire prevention work, some people have developed right-leaning complacent sentiments, believing that forest fire prevention work has a foundation, the masses already pay attention to it, and it is not necessary to make a big effort. This sentiment is very dangerous. To do a better job in forest fire prevention, it is necessary, according to the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, to thoroughly combat rightism, greatly boost enthusiasm, adhere to putting politics in command, rely on the people's communes, vigorously launch mass movements, and continue to carry out mass movements for no forest fires.

Forest fire prevention is a broad, mass-based work, and also a regular task. Especially during the fire danger period, it is even more important to educate the broad masses to be vigilant at all times. Experience has proven that as long as the masses truly understand the great significance of forest fire prevention, the broad masses will actively mobilize and enthusiastically participate in the forest fire prevention movement, preventing the occurrence of forest fires. Benxi County in Liaoning Province used to be a county where forest fires were relatively serious. This spring, thanks to the in-depth development of propaganda and education work on forest fire prevention throughout the county, the masses understood why forest fire prevention is necessary, and preventing forest fires became a conscious action of the people of the entire county. As a result, it leaped to become a county without forest fires.

The people's communes have demonstrated unparalleled superiority in forest fire prevention work. Due to their large organizational scale and abundant human and material resources, the people's communes can utilize these resources more rationally, making it easier to strengthen forest fire prevention work and carry out basic construction work for forest fire prevention in a more planned manner. Therefore, relying on the people's communes and fully leveraging their advantages in forest fire prevention work is a reliable guarantee for doing a good job in forest fire prevention. The people's communes in forested areas should further consolidate, improve, and develop mass-based forest fire prevention organizations, and strengthen the mass ranks of forest fire prevention. According to the fire prevention tasks of the communes, clarify responsibilities, adopt the method of "zoning and dividing areas, assigning responsibilities by area," implement the fire prevention tasks down to the production teams, households, and individuals, and vigorously carry out mass mutual inspection and comparison work.

Strictly controlling fire sources is a fundamental issue in preventing forest fires. If fire sources are eliminated, fires will not start. To control fire sources, it is necessary to strengthen the management of various fire uses and entry into the mountains. Non-productive fire use should be strictly controlled; productive fire use should also be subject to practical management based on the principles of being both conducive to production and to fire prevention. Currently, the "small autumn harvest" movement of going up mountains, entering forests, and going into grasslands is vigorously developing, with a large number of people going up the mountains. It seems that fire sources have increased, but at the same time, the force controlling fire sources has also become stronger. All localities should lead the broad masses participating in the "small autumn harvest" movement to achieve both a bumper harvest in production and to make contributions in the forest fire prevention movement.

Actively and systematically strengthening various facilities for forest fire prevention is also an important guarantee for doing a good job in forest protection. Natural firebreaks such as rivers, roads, and cultivated land within the forest should be used to vigorously open firebreaks. Each key forest area should, according to needs, build forest area roads, establish fire observation towers and fire prevention communication networks, and widely carry out forest fire forecasting. The forest areas of Northeast and Inner Mongolia should further strengthen aerial forest protection work.

Forest fire prevention is everyone's responsibility, and protecting forests is protecting national property. In forest fire prevention work, all localities should give play to the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration, strengthen the joint fire prevention organizations at all levels; all relevant departments, especially forestry, public security, transportation, and commerce departments, should cooperate closely, organize and lead the broad masses to do a better job in the forest fire prevention movement this winter and next spring.

    加强冬春护林防火
    本报评论员
    保护森林是我国林业建设事业中的一项重要工作。危害森林最厉害的是森林火灾，如果预防不好，就可能造成巨大损失。因此，加强护林防火工作，具有重大的意义。
    现在，已进入冬春防火期了。这个时期气候干燥，草木枯干，极易发生山林火灾。特别是今年，许多地区天气干旱；同时随着生产建设的继续跃进，林区的生产建设人员大量增加，生产性用火随之增多，发生火灾的可能性比往年增多。为确保森林安全和林区生产建设的顺利进行，更要加强护林防火工作。
    在党提出的“防胜于救”的护林防火方针的指导下，1958年以来，全国广大林区深入地开展了无森林火灾运动。今年上半年全国绝大多数地区的森林火灾较去年同期大为减少，湖南、广东、陕西、吉林等二十个省（区）已经出现了五百六十六个无森林火灾县。在这个胜利的基础上，东北、内蒙古和南方林区的广大群众已经进一步行动起来，正在开辟防火线和修订防火护林制度和公约，对于作好冬春护林防火工作充满信心。这些都是争取今年护林防火工作全面胜利的有利条件。
    但是也应指出，在护林防火工作取得巨大成绩的同时，有些人产生了右倾松劲情绪，认为护林防火工作有了基础，群众已经重视，可以不必大搞了。这种情绪是十分危险的。要更好地做好护林防火工作，必须根据党的八届八中全会的精神，反透右倾，大鼓干劲，坚持政治挂帅，依靠人民公社，大搞群众运动，继续开展群众性的无森林火灾运动。
    护林防火是一个广泛的群众性的工作，也是一项经常性的工作。尤其在火灾的危险期，更要教育广大群众时刻警惕。经验证明：只要让群众确实了解到护林防火的重大意义，广大群众就会积极地行动起来，热烈参加护林防火运动，防止林火的发生。辽宁省的本溪县，过去是林火发生比较严重的一个县，今春由于在全县深入地开展了护林防火的宣传教育工作，群众懂得了为什么要护林防火，预防森林火灾成了全县人民的自觉行动，结果一跃而为无森林火灾县。
    人民公社在护林防火工作中显示了无比的优越性。人民公社由于组织规模大，人力、物力雄厚，而且能够更合理地利用这些人力、物力，便于加强护林防火工作，便于更有计划地进行护林防火的基本建设工作。因此，依靠人民公社，充分发挥人民公社在护林防火工作中的优越性，是做好护林防火工作的可靠保证。有林地区的各人民公社，应进一步整顿、巩固、健全与发展群众性的护林防火组织，壮大护林防火的群众队伍。根据公社的防火任务，明确责任，采取“分区划片，分片包干”的办法，把防火任务落实到生产队，落实到户和人，并大力开展群众性的互查互比工作。
    严格控制火源，是防止森林火灾发生的一个根本问题。火源消灭了就不会起火。控制火源，必须加强各项用火和入山的管理工作。对非生产用火应严加控制；生产用火也要本着既有利于生产，也有利于防火的原则，加以切实的管理。目前，上山、入林、进草原的“小秋收”运动正在蓬勃开展，大批人马上山，看起来火源增多了，但同时控制火源的力量也更加强大了，各地要领导参加“小秋收”运动的广大群众，既要作到在生产上丰收，也要作到在护林防火运动中立功。
    积极地有步骤地加强护林防火的各项设施，也是做好护林工作的重要保证。林内的河流、道路和耕地等自然隔火地带，要大力开辟防火线。各重点林区，应根据需要，修筑林区道路，建立火情了望台和防火通讯网，广泛开展森林防火预报。东北、内蒙古林区应进一步加强航空护林工作。
    护林防火人人有责，爱护森林就是爱护国家的财产。在护林防火工作中，各地要发挥共产主义大协作的精神，加强各级的护林防火联防组织；各有关部门，特别是林业、公安、交通、商业等部门要密切配合，组织与带领广大群众，把今冬明春的护林防火运动搞得更好。
