Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Dusseldorf court in West Germany concluded the last trial of West German peace fighters this week on the 26th. The entire process of this courtroom farce shows that the accusations against West German patriots are completely untenable.

    The defendant, Diehl, continued his defense when he appeared in court on the 24th. He convincingly proved with concrete facts that the accusation that West German peace fighters were engaged in "activities undermining the constitution" was completely untenable.

    Diehl, a member of the World Peace Council, spoke about the noble mission of the World Peace Council and the work of the West German Committee for the Defense of Peace.

    Diehl pointed out that the West German Committee for the Defense of Peace is aware of and respects the role of the West German Federal Parliament and calls on parliamentarians to make efforts to stop the policy of arming West Germany.

    He questioned the court, is this peaceful call disrespectful of the law and the highest legislative body? What is the purpose of accusing us?

    The defendant Worratt, a member of the West German Committee for the Defense of Peace, continued to defend himself in court for two days, the 24th and 25th. He revealed that accusing him of "activities undermining the constitution" is a shameful conspiracy.

    Worratt proudly spoke of his participation in the war to defend the Spanish republican system. He spoke of the close cooperation between communists and people with different political views in the struggle against Spanish fascism. Worratt said that this is why the West German authorities are particularly dissatisfied with him.

    Worratt emphasized that there is nothing secret in our work to defend peace. On the contrary, we widely publicize the idea of defending peace. However, the West German authorities have adopted the most brutal and illegal police means to try to force us to remain silent.

    Worratt spoke indignantly about the police surveillance of peace fighters and the despicable acts of persecution by the secret police.

    Worratt finally emphasized that the strength of the peace movement is invincible because it has the support of the people of the world and it is a worldwide movement. (Attached picture)

    西德和平战士在法庭上理直气壮宣告
    和平力量不可战胜
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：西德杜塞尔多夫法庭在26日结束了对西德和平战士的本周最后一次审讯。这出法庭丑剧的全部过程表明，对西德爱国者的诬告是完全站不住脚的。
    被告迪尔在24日出庭时继续申辩。他用具体的事实令人信服地证明，指控西德和平战士进行“破坏宪法的活动”这点是完全站不住脚的。
    迪尔是世界和平理事会理事，他谈到了世界和平理事会崇高的使命以及西德保卫和平委员会的工作。
    迪尔指出，西德保卫和平委员会意识到和尊重西德联邦议院的作用，呼吁议员们努力设法制止推行武装西德的政策。
    他质问法庭，难道这种和平的呼吁就是不尊重法律，不尊重最高立法机关吗？控告我们的用心何在呢？
    西德保卫和平委员会委员、被告沃耳拉特24日、25日两天继续在法庭上申辩。他揭露说：控告他进行“破坏宪法的活动”是一种可耻的阴谋。
    沃耳拉特自豪地谈到，他曾参加捍卫西班牙共和制度的战争。他谈到在同西班牙法西斯主义进行的斗争中，共产党人曾经同持有不同政治见解的人密切合作。沃耳拉特说，正因为这样，西德当局对他特别不满。
    沃耳拉特强调指出，在我们保卫和平的工作中没有什么秘密。相反，我们广泛宣传保卫和平的主张。可是，西德当局却采用最粗暴的、非法的警察手段，想强迫我们保持缄默。
    沃耳拉特愤慨地谈到和平战士受到警察监视的情况，谈到秘密警察机关迫害他们的卑劣行为。
    沃耳拉特最后强调指出，保卫和平运动的力量是不可战胜的，因为它有世界人民的支持，它是世界性的运动。（附图片）
