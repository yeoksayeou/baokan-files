Skilled at Flavoring
——An Account of Fan Junkang, Head Chef of Beijing Hotel

Fan Junkang, a chef at Beijing Hotel, attended the National Congress of Heroes with the honor due to a chef. He is an experienced chef with thirty-four years of culinary experience, capable of making more than a thousand kinds of exquisite and delicious dishes.

Fan Junkang often says: "The work of a chef is not only service work, but also work with a political dimension. If a chef can make delicious and palatable dishes, people will be full of energy and work harder after eating them; if a chef can use good food and delicacies to entertain foreign guests, it will further demonstrate the richness and diversity of our country's culinary art." Over the past few years, Fan Junkang has managed the work of the Beijing Hotel kitchen in an orderly manner, and the menu designs for each banquet are satisfactory. He also often goes to the vegetable market to see what seasonal new dishes are available. Sometimes, even at twelve o'clock at night, Fan Junkang is still pondering how to make the dishes even better. Last year, Fan Junkang and other chefs created more than fifty new dishes.

Although Fan Junkang possesses superb skills, he is never satisfied with his achievements and often humbly learns from the strengths of others. Every time he goes to a place, the chefs of various restaurants are a little surprised: How can a nationally renowned chef come to us to learn? Fan Junkang's sincere learning attitude and desire for knowledge moved the chefs of various restaurants, and they unreservedly told him the methods of making many famous dishes, allowing Fan Junkang to learn the cooking methods of more than eighty dishes, greatly enriching the content of Beijing Hotel's dishes.

There are many young chefs and new apprentices at Beijing Hotel, and they all like and respect Fan Junkang. In the kitchen, one can often hear: "Master Fan! How should this dish be cut?" "Master Fan! Please taste my dish and see how the flavor is?" etc. The requests are multifaceted, but Fan Junkang has never shown any annoyance and always patiently explains the problems clearly until the other party is satisfied.

This year, the leaders of Beijing Hotel asked him and other veteran chefs to train more than thirty new chefs, and Baotou Iron and Steel Company also sent twenty apprentices to ask them to train them. Fan Junkang and other veteran chefs actively accepted this task. Every time Fan Junkang teaches how to make a dish, he patiently explains it clearly, again and again, from the selection of raw materials, cutting and processing, the use of seasonings, and the mastery of the heat. With the help of Fan Junkang and other chefs, more than thirty new chefs are already able to cook a variety of delicious dishes.

    善调百味
    ——记北京饭店厨师长范俊康
    北京饭店厨师范俊康，带着厨师的荣誉参加了全国群英大会。他是一位有三十四年烹调经验的老厨师，能做一千多种精致而又味美的菜肴。
    范俊康常说：“厨师的工作，不仅仅是服务工作，也是有政治性的工作。厨师能把菜做得味美适口，人们吃了就精神百倍干劲更足；厨师能用好菜佳肴接待外宾，就更显得我们国家在烹调艺术上的丰富多采。”几年来，范俊康把北京饭店厨房的工作，管理得井井有条，每次宴会的菜单设计都令人满意。他还时常到菜市走走，看看市场上有什么时令新菜。有时已是深夜十二点了，范俊康还在深思怎么把菜做得更好。去年，范俊康和其他厨师就创造了五十多种新菜肴。
    范俊康虽身有高超的技术，可是他从不满足自己的成就，经常虚心学习别人的长处。他每到一个地方，各家的厨师都有点奇怪：闻名全国的厨师，怎么到我们这里来学习呢？范俊康诚恳的学习态度和求知欲望，感动了各个饭庄的厨师，他们都毫无保留的把许多名菜的做法告诉了他，使范俊康学会了八十多个菜的烹调方法，大大丰富了北京饭店菜点的内容。
    北京饭店有不少青年厨师和新徒工，他们也都喜欢和尊重范俊康。在厨房里常常可以听到：“范师傅！这个菜怎么切呀？”“范师傅！你尝尝我这个菜口味怎么样？”等等。要求是多方面的，范俊康从来没有表示过厌烦，总是耐心地把问题解释清楚，直到对方满意为止。
    今年，北京饭店领导上让他和其它老厨师培养三十多名新厨师，包头钢铁公司也送来二十位徒工请他们培养。范俊康等老厨师积极接受了这一任务。范俊康每教做一个菜，都从原料选择、切割加工、调料运用、火候的掌握等方面，耐心地一遍又一遍地讲解清楚。在范俊康等厨师的帮助下，有三十多名新厨师已经能够烹调多样美味的菜肴了。
