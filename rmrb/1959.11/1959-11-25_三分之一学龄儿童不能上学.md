Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, November 11th: The Turkish newspaper "New Era" discusses the backward state of education in Turkey. According to the newspaper, 60% of Turkish residents are illiterate, and out of 3.5 million children, more than one million school-age children do not attend school. Turkey lacks 17,000 school buildings, and there is also a severe shortage of teachers.

The newspaper emphasized that these figures are based on the materials from the National Education Committee report (in which well-known Turkish experts and foreign experts participated). This report was published abroad four months ago, but until then, it was a secret to the Turkish newspapers and the public.

    三分之一学龄儿童不能上学
    新华社讯　塔斯社安卡拉11日电：土耳其“新时代”报谈到土耳其教育的落后情况。据这家报纸报道，在土耳其居民中，有60％是文盲，在三百五十万儿童当中，有一百多万学龄儿童没有上学。土耳其缺少一万七千所学校的校舍，教师也非常感到缺乏。
    这家报纸着重指出，这些数字是根据全国教育委员会的报告（参加这个委员会的有著名的土耳其专家和外国专家）的材料。这个报告早在四个月以前就在外国发表了，但是在此以前，对土耳其的报纸和公众来说，这还是个秘密。
