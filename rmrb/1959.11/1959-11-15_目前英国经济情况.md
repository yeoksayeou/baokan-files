    Current Economic Situation in Britain
    Zhou Ying
    Britain began its economic crisis in the third quarter of 1957. The British government adopted a series of "anti-crisis" measures in 1958, such as easing credit and stimulating domestic consumption. In 1958, consumer spending increased, and industrial production also improved slightly. The industrial production index for 1958 was 106 (1954=100), a decrease of approximately 1% compared to 1957. In the first three quarters of 1959, the British economy gradually recovered somewhat from the recession. However, the development of various economic sectors was unbalanced, and the economic trend continued to hover at a low level, fluctuating up and down.
    
    Unbalanced Development, Heavy Industry Not Recovered
    The total industrial production index began to rebound in the fourth quarter of 1958 and rose by 6% by July this year, exceeding the high point before the industrial decline. In the first eight months of this year, it increased by 2.8% compared to the same period last year.
    
    However, it should be pointed out that the recovery of various sectors is very unbalanced. Many means of production sectors have recovered slowly or even remained at a low level. The steel industry's production remains stagnant due to reduced demand. Although August steel production increased by 13% compared to the same month in 1958, it was still 10% lower than the same month in 1957, and the operating rate remained only at 70%-80%. Machine production, excluding electrical machinery, generally declined at the beginning of this year, with only a slight improvement recently. Although shipbuilding production can be maintained, orders are extremely scarce, the tonnage under construction is constantly declining, and the outlook is very difficult. The coal mining industry remains in a state of crisis. These four sectors account for approximately one-quarter of the total industrial output value. Only the consumer goods sector has recovered more significantly, especially durable consumer goods and automobiles, which have grown more and faster, due to the artificial stimulus of the government's expansionary policy. General consumer goods such as textiles, clothing, and shoes, which originally declined the most, have also rebounded, while the food, beverage, and tobacco sectors continue to rise.
    
    Domestic Market Relies on Credit and Installment Purchases to Maintain
    In the past nine months of this year, members of the British Bankers' Association have lent a total of £2.69 billion to consumers or merchants, an increase of £588 million, or 29%, compared to nine months ago. This huge amount of loans has supported the domestic consumer market from all aspects, creating a false sense of active consumption and artificially stimulating the production of consumer goods. At the same time, installment purchase debts have surged. From August 1958 to August 1959, installment purchase debts rose from £214 million to £820 million, which stimulated the consumer market, but this cannot last.
    
    Recently, signs of domestic inflation have reappeared.
    
    Fixed Capital Investment Shows No Signs of Recovery
    In the first half of 1959, fixed capital investment showed no signs of recovery. This is the main reason why heavy industrial production has not been fully restored. Total fixed capital investment, calculated at constant prices, began to decline in the third quarter of 1958 and continued to decline in the first quarter of 1959. Private investment sectors still maintained a slight increase in 1958 but also began to decline in the first quarter of 1959.
    
    The main reason for the decline in fixed capital investment is the larger decline in investment in the manufacturing industry, which accounts for three-quarters of the total industrial output value. Following a 5% decline in the fourth quarter of 1958, manufacturing industry investment fell another 11% in the first quarter of 1959. Among them, investment in plant, machinery, and equipment (accounting for two-thirds of manufacturing industry investment) fell by 11%, and construction investment (accounting for more than one-quarter of manufacturing industry investment) fell by 16%. Only vehicle investment (accounting for 5% of manufacturing industry investment) increased by 11%.
    
    Increased Unemployment, Rising Mass Struggles
    Although the number of unemployed has decreased from a peak of 620,000 in January this year to 276,000 in July due to the gradual recovery of industrial production, it increased again to 427,000 in August. Moreover, the actual number of unemployed is much higher than the official figures. The workers' movement against the government's wage freeze policy has risen again. After the closing of the Trades Union Congress annual meeting in September 1959, unions in various industries put forward demands for wage increases and reduced working hours for six million people, including the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions with three million members. Recently, British dockworkers have begun a strike demanding wage increases. In the first nine months of this year, strikes involved 507,000 people, resulting in a loss of 4.87 million working days, while in the whole of last year, the number of strikers was only 425,000, with a loss of 3.2 million working days.
    
    Foreign Trade Deficit Widens
    In terms of competition in foreign markets, Britain's foreign trade deficit is widening. British exports rebounded after the third quarter of 1958, and by the second quarter of this year, in terms of physical volume, they had risen by 6.5% from the low point, recovering to the level of the second quarter of 1957, before the decline. In the first eight months of this year, British exports totaled £2.262 billion, an increase of 3% compared to the same period last year, but imports totaled £2.58 billion, an increase of 5%, resulting in a 30% widening of the trade deficit compared to the same period last year. The trade deficit continued to increase sharply in September, reaching the highest figure since December last year. The main reason for the widening trade deficit is that the downward trend in colonial raw material prices, which began at the beginning of the year, has stopped, and the prices of British imports have risen, no longer enjoying the benefits gained from the decline in raw material prices last year.
    
    British exports to the Sterling Area continue to decline due to the reduced foreign trade income and weakened purchasing power of the colonies last year, but have gradually recovered since the second half of the year. In the first seven months, British exports to the Sterling Area totaled £790 million, a decrease of 5% compared to the same period last year. British exports to the United States continue to grow steadily. In the first seven months, British exports to the United States totaled £208 million, an increase of 40% compared to the same month last year, accounting for 10% of the total British exports. The increase in automobiles was the largest in exports to the United States, accounting for more than one-quarter of the total exports to the United States. Other products, such as generators and electrical equipment, aircraft, machine tools, industrial raw materials, and hardware, also saw significant growth due to American manufacturers preparing for the major steel strike and stockpiling a large amount of inventory in the first half of the year. British exports to Western Europe have also increased under the conditions of the initial recovery of industrial production in most Western European countries. In the first seven months, British exports to Western Europe totaled £514 million, an increase of 9% compared to the same period last year, but have never recovered to the level before the decline.

    目前英国经济情况
    周璎
    英国在1957年第三季度，开始了经济危机。英国政府在1958年内采取了一系列“反危机”的措施，比如，放松信贷、刺激国内消费等，1958年消费者支出有了增长，工业生产也稍有好转。1958年工业生产指数为106（1954＝100），较1957年下降约1％。1959年头三个季度，英国经济从萧条阶段逐渐取得一些好转。但是，各个经济部门的发展是不平衡的，经济趋势仍然是在低水平上盘旋不定，上下起伏着。
    发展不平衡，重工业未恢复
    工业生产总指数自1958年第四季度开始回升，到今年7月共上升6％，已超过工业下降前的高点。今年头八个月较去年同期增加2.8％。
    但是应当指出：各部门回升情况很不平衡。不少生产资料部门则回升缓慢甚至停留在低水平上。钢铁工业由于需要量减少，生产仍然停滞。8月份的钢产量虽比1958年同月增加13％，却仍比1957年同月低10％，开工率仍仅为70％—80％。电机以外的机器生产总的说来今年年初时还在下降，只是最近才略有起色。造船业产量虽能维持但订货极缺，建造中的吨位不断下降，前景十分困难。采煤业仍处于危机状态。这四部门大致占工业产值四分之一左右。由于政府的膨胀政策的人为刺激，只有消费品部门回升较明显，特别是耐用消费品和小汽车增长更多、更快。原来下降最大的纺织、衣着、靴鞋等一般消费品也已回升，食品、饮料、烟草部门则继续上升。
    国内市场依赖信贷赊购维持
    今年的九个月来英国银行家协会的成员共贷出二十六亿九千万英镑给消费者或商人，比九个月前增加五亿八千八百万英镑，即29％。这笔巨额贷款从各方面支撑了国内消费市场，造成虚假的消费活跃，人为刺激着消费品的生产。同时，赊购债务激增。从1958年8月到1959年8月，赊购债务从二亿一千四百万英镑上升到八亿二千万英镑，对消费市场起了刺激作用，但是不能持久。
    近来，国内通货膨胀迹象重又出现。
    固定资本投资仍无恢复迹象
    1959年上半年固定资本投资仍无恢复迹象。这是重工业生产始终不能完全恢复的主要原因。总固定资本投资按不变价格计算在1958年第三季度开始下降，1959年第一季度仍继续下降。私营投资部门在1958年内还保持些微增长，在1959年第一季度也开始下降。
    固定资本投资下降的主要原因是占整个工业产值四分之三的制造工业的投资下降幅度较大。制造工业投资继1958年第四季度下降5％后，1959年第一季度又下降11％，其中厂房机器设备投资（占制造工业投资三分之二）下降11％，建筑投资（占制造工业投资四分之一以上）下降16％，只有车辆投资（占制造工业投资5％）增加11％。
    失业人数增多，群众斗争高涨
    失业人数虽然由于工业生产的逐步恢复，从今年1月份的高峰六十二万人降到7月份的二十七万六千人，但是8月份又增至四十二万七千人，而且，失业人数实际上远比官方公布的数字更多。工人群众反对政府冻结工资政策的运动又高涨起来。1959年9月职工大会年会闭幕以后，各业工会提出增加工资，减少工时的要求的达六百万人，其中包括三百万会员的造船和机器工会联合会。最近英国码头工人已开始要求增加工资的罢工。今年头九个月，罢工涉及五十万七千人，损失四百八十七万个劳动日，而去年全年罢工人数只有四十二万五千人，损失三百二十万个劳动日。
    对外贸易逆差日益扩大
    在国外市场竞争方面，英国对外贸易逆差日益扩大。英国出口自1958年第三季度后回升，到今年第二季度按实物量来看已由低点上升6.5％，恢复到1957年第二季度即下降前水平。今年头八个月英国出口共二十二亿六千二百万英镑，较去年同期增加3％，但是进口共二十五亿八千万英镑，增加5％，以致贸易逆差较去年同期扩大30％。9月份贸易逆差继续剧增，为去年12月以来最高数字。贸易逆差扩大的主要原因是年初以来殖民地原料价格下跌趋势已告停止，英进口货价格上涨，不再享有去年原料价格下跌所取得的便宜。
    英国对英镑区出口由于殖民地去年对外贸易收入减少，购买能力减弱而继续下降，下半年以来渐有恢复。头七个月，英国对英镑区出口共七亿九千万英镑，较去年同期下降5％。英国对美国出口继续不断增长。头七个月英国对美国出口共二亿零八百万英镑，较去年同月增加40％，占英国出口总值的10％。对美国出口货以汽车增加最多，占对美出口总值四分之一以上，其他如发电机和电气设备、飞机、机床、工业原料、五金等也因美国厂商准备钢铁大罢工，上半年大量囤积存货而有显著增长。英国对西欧的出口，在多数西欧国家工业生产初步回升的条件下亦有增长。头七个月，英国对西欧出口共五亿一千四百万英镑，较去年同期增加9％，但始终没有恢复到下降前的水平。
