    Merriment in the people's school,
    There are also couples sharing a bench,
    There are also three generations becoming classmates,
    There are also daughters-in-law teaching mothers-in-law.
        (Longyan Prefecture, Jiang Bin)

    民校里头闹呵呵
    民校里头闹呵呵，
    也有夫妻共凳坐，
    也有三代成同学，
    也有儿媳教婆婆。
