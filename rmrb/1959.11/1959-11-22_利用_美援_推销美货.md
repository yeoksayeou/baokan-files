Using "US Aid" to Promote American Goods
Zhang Zhenya

Recently, the United States introduced a new restriction in its foreign "aid" program: "Buy American." On October 19th, the Development Loan Fund, flaunting the banner of "developing the economies of backward countries," issued a statement: All countries receiving this "aid" in the future must use the borrowed funds to "buy American goods."

The Development Loan Fund was established by the US government in 1957 to "provide assistance" to underdeveloped countries. At the time, in order to increase the attractiveness of this "aid," Washington not only portrayed the motivation for establishing this fund as "purely to help the people of underdeveloped countries improve their lives" but also boasted that loans could be repaid in local currency, putting on quite a show. However, in less than two years, the US State Department hastily attached the "Buy American" label to it.

"US Aid" has always been a way to pave the road for the export of American capital and goods, and this has long been no secret. Washington's open addition of the "Buy American" restriction further exposes the falsehood that "US Aid" is intended to improve the lives of people in backward countries, confirming that it is merely a guise for the US to plunder the people of these countries.

In recent years, because American export goods are expensive and their competitiveness has greatly weakened, "US Aid" has not been able to guarantee 100% of American commodity exports. According to a survey by the State Department's Development Loan Fund, in the past two years, various underdeveloped countries have used 44% of the loans provided by the fund to import goods from Western Europe and Japan. Therefore, in order to "enable the US dollars flowing out of the Development Loan Fund to increase US exports," Washington decided that "the Development Loan Fund should mainly focus on providing funds for purchasing goods and services from the United States."

Needless to say, the Development Loan Fund's decision to "Buy American" this time did not consider its "aid" recipients, the underdeveloped countries. The November 3rd "Washington Post" pointed out: "India, which receives 'US Aid', could have purchased industrial materials from cheaper markets," but "the Development Loan Fund's condition of buying American goods will increase India's costs by at least 40%."

The lie of "US Aid" has thus been exposed by Washington once again. However, the US ruling authorities have an even more pressing reason for attaching the "Buy American" condition to "US Aid." This is to reverse the recent deterioration in the US trade and international balance of payments situation and the outflow of gold.

Originally, US exports have been declining for two years. In 1957, the United States exported $19.3 billion worth of goods (excluding arms exports, same below), which fell to $16.2 billion in 1958. Calculated at an annual rate, exports in the first quarter of this year fell further to $15.2 billion; the second quarter only reached a level of $15.6 billion. That is to say, in two years, the decline in US commodity exports reached nearly $4 billion. However, during the same period, the overall trend of imported goods, except for a slight decrease in 1958, was actually rapidly increasing: from $13.3 billion in 1957 to an annual rate of $14.8 billion in the first half of 1959. Due to the increase in imports and the reduction in exports, the US trade surplus fell from $6 billion in 1957 to about $700 million in the first half of this year. On the other hand, US big monopoly groups and the Washington authorities must spend more than $7.5 billion annually on private capital exports, overseas military expenditures, and economic aid for overseas aggression activities. This creates a situation where the trade surplus cannot make up for the deficit in the international balance of payments. In 1958, the US foreign payments had a deficit of $3.4 billion, and this year another deficit of $4 billion is expected. In less than two years, $3 billion in gold has flowed out, causing the depreciation of the US dollar against the pound and the mark. With the dollar facing an increasing crisis, Washington certainly cannot allow "US Aid" to be used to buy goods from Western Europe and Japan.

However, the United States has another purpose in attaching the "Buy American" condition to its "foreign aid" fund. It wants to force Western Europe and Japan to lift import restrictions on American goods by cutting off the trade relations between underdeveloped countries and Western Europe and Japan.

Originally, in the early post-war period, Western Europe and Japan, in view of the damage to their economic strength and their inability to compete with US monopoly organizations, adopted a series of measures to protect their domestic industries and avoid the large-scale infiltration of American goods, which would cause international payment difficulties (the so-called "dollar shortage"), such as foreign exchange controls, import quotas, and high tariffs to restrict the intrusion of American goods. In 1949, Western Europe and Japan experienced a severe "dollar shortage" and were forced to devalue their currencies. Even today, among the 37 countries participating in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 21 countries still implement import restrictions to maintain reserves. However, the United States has long been dissatisfied with the practice of these countries, especially Britain, France, Italy, and Japan, restricting the import of American goods. Before 1957, since most countries in Japan and Western Europe lacked sufficient gold and dollar reserves and their currencies were unstable, Washington could not find an excuse to force them to open their markets. However, in the past two years, as these countries' reserves have increased and their trade strength has recovered, the pressure from the United States for them to relax imports has also increased. Britain was forced to relax restrictions on US imports in June of this year, but recently, after Britain had a trade surplus with the United States for twelve consecutive months, and Japan, France, and West Germany changed from having trade deficits with the United States for many years to having trade surpluses with the United States, Washington's "patience" reached its limit.

The implementation of the "Buy American" policy is a serious blow to Western Europe and Japan. For example, Latin American countries receiving "US Aid" will greatly reduce their imports of electrical machinery from Britain. India will also be unable to use "US Aid" to import equipment for its five-year plan from Western Europe. As for the plan of the Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan to conduct economic expansion in Southeast Asia with "US capital, Japanese technology, and Southeast Asian resources," it will have to be abandoned. However, Washington did not stop there. After the "Buy American" regulation was announced, US Under Secretary of State Dillon continued to vehemently criticize Western European countries and Japan at the GATT meeting in Tokyo, saying that their restrictions on American imports caused the US to have a $4 billion payment deficit this year. He not only implied that the current prosperity of Western Europe and Japan did not have a solid foundation, because they were relying on the United States to provide loans to economically underdeveloped countries to maintain their exports to these countries, but also further threatened that continuing to restrict American imports would lead to severe retaliation from the United States. At the same time, major American bourgeois newspapers also clamored that since Western European countries' gold and dollar reserves had increased to more than $21 billion by the middle of this year, it was simply "ungrateful" for them to continue to restrict the import of American goods to the "aid" from the United States.

This series of intimidation by the US ruling authorities has been refuted by the British bourgeois press. The British "Economist" weekly pointed out that the US international balance of payments deficit is actually political rather than economic. Because although the US export trade has declined, it is still in surplus; it is only because Washington's other foreign expenditures are too large that it has caused a huge payment deficit. The British "Financial Times" believes that the deterioration of US trade with Western Europe, especially with Britain, is mainly due to the fact that the exchange rate of the US dollar is set too high, which has caused unfavorable conditions for US exports, and should not be attributed to Britain and Western Europe.

However, despite this, Britain, which has changed from a trade deficit to a surplus in its trade relations with the United States and is increasingly dependent on the American market, finally "yielded" to Washington and announced at the beginning of this month that, from November 9th, it would relax the import of a batch of American goods that did not pose a major threat to the British market, such as automobiles, textiles, and optical instruments. As for the relaxation of imports of pharmaceuticals and many important agricultural products that the United States was eagerly awaiting, the London authorities have not yet loosened their grip.

France, which has also turned into a trade surplus with the United States, also took the lead in relaxing import restrictions on several types of US dollar zone imports that did not pose a major pressure on the domestic market, such as building materials, refrigerators, textiles, fabrics, and agricultural machinery, because the devaluation of the franc has made it more competitive in exports, its trade situation has improved, and it is also afraid of American retaliation. In order to appease Washington, Finance Minister Pinay also issued a blank check: in principle, it will remove the import quotas for all industrial products from the dollar zone and Europe within no more than two years. It should be noted here that these decisions are not related to the old tariff rates. Britain and France still levy the same taxes on the above-mentioned imports from the United States as before. For example, a US car imported into Britain is still subject to a 30% tariff, plus a 50% sales tax. Japan, on the other hand, reportedly decided to allow the free import of ten commodities, such as scrap iron and pig iron, from the dollar zone by the end of September next year, because it "understands that the United States' demand for Japan to implement (trade) liberalization is very strong." According to an analysis by "The Times," this measure is only a gesture, and the actual effect is not great. In addition, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry is still "considering" the liberalization of soybean imports required by the United States. No wonder US Assistant Secretary of Commerce Kearns said in Tokyo on the 6th of this month that Japan's removal of discrimination against American goods was "not fast enough."

As for Italy, West Germany and other countries, despite the pressure from Washington, they have not yet clearly committed themselves to relaxing import restrictions on American goods. For example, although the International Monetary Fund, manipulated by the United States, has announced that Italy "has no reason to continue to implement trade discrimination in order to maintain dollar exchange," the Italian representative attending the GATT meeting believes that "their country has already relaxed trade as much as possible, and trying to reduce import restrictions on the dollar zone will only cause consequences that are detrimental to European imports." As a result, US Secretary of State Herter reiterated on the 16th of this month at the US National Trade Association that Western Europe and Japan should take action to open the door for US exports. Washington has just implemented trade restrictions using the "Buy American" method, and immediately turned around and demanded that other countries relax trade restrictions, which is obviously going too far. For example, the British "Times" said: Britain and France have relaxed import restrictions on goods from the dollar zone, but the United States has decided to link US exports with the loans of the Development Loan Fund, which is unacceptable.

    利用“美援”推销美货
    张振亚
    美国最近在它的对外“援助”计划中提出一个新限制：“买美国货”。10月19日，打着“开发落后国家经济”招牌的开发贷款基金发表了声明：今后所有接受这项“援助”的国家都必须以借得的款“购买美国货”。
    开发贷款基金是1957年美国政府为向不发达国家“提供援助”而设置的基金。当时，华盛顿为了增加这项“援助”的诱惑性，不仅把设置这个基金的动机说成是“纯粹为了帮助不发达国家人民提高生活”，而且还吹嘘贷款可以用当地货币偿还，装得蛮像个样子。但是为时不到两年，美国国务院就急忙为它贴上了“买美国货”的标签。
    “美援”一向就是为美国资本和商品输出开辟道路，这早就不是什么秘密了。华盛顿现在又公开为它加上这条“买美国货”的限制，就更加暴露了“美援”是为了提高落后国家人民生活的鬼话，证实它只不过是美国掠夺这些国家人民的幌子罢了。
    近年来，由于美国出口货物价格昂贵，竞争力大大削弱，“美援”在保证美国商品出口方面，已经达不到百分之百的程度。据国务院开发贷款基金的调查，近两年来，各个不发达国家竟用了这个基金提供的44％的贷款输入西欧和日本货物。因此，华盛顿为了让“开发贷款基金流出的美元能使美国输出增加”，就决定“开发贷款基金主要着重提供向美国购买货物和劳务的经费”。
    不用说，开发贷款基金这次作出“买美国货”的决定，并没有考虑它的“援助”对象不发达国家。11月3日的“华盛顿邮报”已经指出：接受“美援”的“印度本来可以从比较便宜的市场购买工业材料”，可是“开发贷款基金附加购买美国货的条件，将使印度付出的成本至少增加40％。”
    “美援”的谎话就这样由华盛顿再一次揭穿。但是美国统治当局对“美援”附加“买美国货”的条件，还有更迫切的原因。这就是要挽回最近美国贸易和国际收支情况的恶化和黄金的外流。
    原来美国的出口两年来一直在下降。1957年美国输出商品（除掉军火出口，下同）一百九十三亿美元，1958年落到一百六十二亿美元。按年率计算，今年第一季出口，再跌到一百五十二亿美元；第二季也只达到一百五十六亿美元的水平。这就是说，两年中美国商品输出下降幅度曾达到近四十亿美元。但在同时期，进口商品除1958年略降外，总趋势反而是迅速上升：从1957年的一百三十三亿美元增加到1959年上半年的年率一百四十八亿美元，由于进口增加、出口减缩，美国的商品出超遂从1957年的六十亿美元下降到今年上半年的约七亿美元。另一方面，美国大垄断集团和华盛顿当局每年为进行海外侵略活动，在私人资本输出、海外军费开支和经济援助方面都必须花用七十五亿美元以上。这样就形成贸易出超弥补不了国际收支亏空。1958年美国对外收支出现三十四亿美元逆差，今年又将出现四十亿美元亏空。在不到两年中已流出三十亿美元黄金，造成了美元对英镑、马克汇价的下跌。在美元已日益出现危机的情况下，华盛顿当然就不能听任用“美援”去买西欧和日本的货物了。
    但是，美国在它的“援外”基金中附加“买美国货”的条件，还有另一个目的。它想以中断经济不发达国家同西欧和日本的贸易关系为手段来迫使后者取消对美国货的进口限制。
    原来战后初期西欧和日本鉴于自己经济力量遭到破坏，无力同美国的垄断组织竞争，为了保护本国工业，避免美货大批渗入，造成国际支付困难（即所谓“美元荒”），曾采取了一系列措施，如外汇管制、进口限额和高关税等来限制美货的侵入。在1949年，西欧和日本就曾经历了严重的“美元荒”并被迫作了货币贬值。直到今天在参加关税和贸易总协定的三十七个国家中，仍有二十一个国家为了保持储备实行进口限制。但是美国对这些国家，特别是英国、法国、意大利和日本限制美货进口的作法，长期以来一直不满。1957年以前，由于日本和西欧大多数国家都黄金美元储备不足，币值不稳，华盛顿虽欲找借口迫使它们开放市场也不可得。可是近两年来随着这些国家储备的增加与贸易力量的恢复，美国要它们放宽进口的压力也越来越大。英国已被迫于今年6月放宽了对美国进口货的限制，但是最近在英国一连十二个月对美国贸易出超，日本、法国和西德也由多年来对美入超一变而为对美出超以后，华盛顿的“忍耐”就达到了极限。
    “买美国货”的办法实行后是对西欧和日本的一个严重的打击。例如接受“美援”的拉丁美洲各国，将大大减少从英国进口电气机械。印度也势将不能以“美援”从西欧输入它的五年计划的器材。至于日本岸信介政府所梦想的“用美国资本、日本技术、东南亚资源”来在东南亚进行经济扩张的计划，那就更加只好付之流水了。可是华盛顿并不就此罢手。在“买美国货”的规定宣布之后，美国副国务卿狄龙在东京关税和贸易总协定会议上继续猛烈指责西欧国家和日本，说它们限制美货进口造成了今年美国四十亿美元的支付逆差。他不仅暗示：西欧和日本目前的繁荣没有稳固基础，因为它们是依赖美国向经济不发达国家提供贷款来维持它们对这些国家的出口的，并且还进一步威胁说，继续限制美货进口会招致美国的严厉报复。同时，美国各大资产阶级报纸也在喧嚷：西欧国家今年年中的黄金美元储备既已增加到二百一十亿美元以上，再限制美货进口，那简直是对美国“援助”的“忘恩负义”。
    美国统治当局的这一系列恫吓曾遭到英国资产阶级报刊的驳斥。英国“经济学家”周刊指出美国的国际收支逆差，实际上是政治性的而不是经济性的。因为美国的出口贸易虽然下降，但仍然是出超的；只是由于华盛顿对外其他支出过大才造成了巨大支付逆差。英国“金融时报”则认为美国对西欧、特别是对英国的贸易恶化主要是美元外汇牌价订得太高，从而造成美国出口的不利，而绝不应归咎于英国和西欧。
    可是尽管如此，在对美贸易关系已由入超变为出超并日益依赖美国市场的英国，最后终于向华盛顿“屈服”，于本月初宣布，自11月9日起放宽一批对英国市场威胁不大的美国货进口，如汽车、纺织品、光学仪器等。至于美国所切盼的放宽医药品和许多重要农产品进口，伦敦当局仍然没有松口。
    对美也变成出超的法国，由于法郎贬值后，出口竞争力强，贸易情况好转，又害怕美国报复，也率先放宽了对本国市场压力不大的几种美元区进口限制，如建筑材料、冰箱、纺织品、布匹、农业机器等。为了安慰华盛顿，财政部长比内还开出了一张空头支票：原则上将在不超过两年的时间内，取消对美元区和欧洲所有工业品进口的限额。这里需要说明的是，这些决定与旧的关税税率并不相干。英、法仍然对美国的上述进口品课以同以前一样的税。例如美国汽车输入英国仍被课以30％的关税，另外还要课以50％的营业税。而日本据说由于“了解到美国要日本实行（贸易）自由化的要求非常强硬”，也决定在明年9月底以前让美元区进口的废铁、生铁等十种商品自由入口。这一措施，据“泰晤士报”分析，仅是一种姿态，实际效果不大。另外日本通商产业省对于美国所要求的大豆进口自由化，仍然在“考虑中”。难怪美国商务助理部长基恩斯本月6日在东京要说，日本取消对美货的歧视进行得“太不够快”。
    至于意大利、西德等国，虽有华盛顿的压力，它们直到现在还没有明白承担放宽美国货入口限制的义务。例如，尽管在美国操纵下的国际货币基金会已经宣布，意大利“没有理由继续实行贸易歧视以保持美元兑换”，可是出席关税和贸易总协定会议的意大利代表却认为，“他们的国家目前已经尽可能地放宽贸易了，设法减少对美元区进口品的限制只会引起不利于欧洲进口的后果。”于是，美国国务卿赫脱本月16日在美国全国贸易协会上再次强调：西欧和日本应采取行动，为美国的出口敞开大门。华盛顿刚用“买美国货”的办法实行了贸易限制，马上又反过来要求其他国家放宽贸易限制，显然做得太过分了。譬如，英国“泰晤士报”就说：英、法放宽了对美元区货物的进口限制，美国却决定把美国的出口和开发贷款基金的贷款连结在一起，这是令人无法接受的。
