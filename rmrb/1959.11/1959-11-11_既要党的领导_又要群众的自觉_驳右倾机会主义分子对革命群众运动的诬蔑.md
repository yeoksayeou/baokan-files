	Both Party Leadership and Mass Consciousness Are Necessary
	Refuting the Slanders of Right-leaning Opportunists Against Revolutionary Mass Movements

	Without Mass Consciousness, There Would Be No Revolutionary Mass Movement

	Right-leaning opportunists slander our revolutionary mass movements as not being conscious actions of the masses. They distort individual instances of commandism in the work style of some cadres, exaggerating them to claim that the Party's lines and policies are all imposed upon the masses, rather than arising from the masses' own conscious will. Everyone knows that the correctness of lines and policies is completely different from the individual shortcomings that may occur in implementing those lines and policies. The correctness or incorrectness of lines and policies plays a decisive role in the success or failure of the revolutionary cause. Certain individual shortcomings in work style and methods cannot determine the success or failure of the revolutionary cause. Moreover, after determining the correct lines and policies, we have always attached great importance to the issue of work style and methods, and we have always been serious about correcting even individual temporary shortcomings and errors. This is what we have done in practice. So, are the Party's lines and policies imposed upon the masses? Absolutely not. The only measure of whether the Party's lines and policies are correct is whether they reflect the highest interests of the vast majority of the people and whether they concentrate the will and aspirations of the vast majority of the people. So, was the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," which the Party established in 1958, as well as the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement under the guidance of this general line, the will and aspiration of the vast majority of the people?

	Practice is the criterion for testing truth. Here, we might as well speak a little further. As everyone knows, our country is a "poor and blank" nation, and 650 million people urgently demand to change this historically impoverished situation. "Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, to work, to revolution." Is it better to change faster or slower? Is it better to have more revolutionary enthusiasm or less? These are two fundamentally different methods for our socialist construction. These two methods have been repeatedly compared in the practice of the broad masses of the people. In 1956, on the basis of the victorious completion of the socialist transformation of the three major sectors, the people's masses roused their revolutionary enthusiasm, and the national economy experienced a leap-forward situation. However, at that time, some people stirred up an evil wind of right-leaning thought, calling this "leap forward" an "rash advance." Under the influence of this evil wind, an anti-"rash advance" campaign was launched in 1957, and the development of the national economy showed a "saddle shape," with industrial and agricultural production and other socialist construction endeavors proceeding slowly for a year. Thanks to our wise and great Chairman Mao, who promptly corrected this error of opposing "rash advances," and on the basis of the great victory of the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, the people's masses roused even greater revolutionary enthusiasm. Starting in the winter of 1957, the situation of a great leap forward in the national economy emerged again. The broad masses of the people emancipated their minds, broke down superstitions, and promoted the communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. Everyone was catching up with the advanced, and everyone was striving to move forward. Right-leaning conservatism and the idea of being content with staying behind were despised by public opinion. The stark contrast between the two methods and the two results led the broad masses of the people to draw a positive conclusion from their own practice: resolutely support the method of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and resolutely oppose the method of achieving lesser, slower, worse, and more costly results. At this time, in May 1958, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao concentrated the strong desire of the people's masses and promptly put forward the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism." The announcement of the Party's general line made the people's masses' soaring revolutionary enthusiasm burst out like an atomic explosion, and a situation of an all-round great leap forward emerged, with steel as the key link, leading the way, and all industries galloping forward.

	The pace of the Great Leap Forward promoted the people's desire for large collectives. They affirmed that the merger of many advanced agricultural production cooperatives into larger ones in the first half of 1958, the trial implementation of the integration of administrative and commune functions, and the establishment of public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and other collective welfare undertakings were good ways to realize this desire. At this time, in July and August 1958, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao once again grasped the hearts of the people and, summarizing the people's creative efforts in trying out people's communes, put forward the call of "People's communes are good." This call once again ignited the enthusiasm of the vast majority of the people. The peasant masses built their beloved new big family—the people's commune, whose light shone across the land like the sun.

	From the above undeniable facts, it is fully proven that the Party's lines and policies come from the masses and go to the masses, and are by no means subjective fabrications of anyone. Practice has also fully proven that our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are the most adept at concentrating the will of the people, understanding the aspirations of the people, and representing the interests of the people. I am afraid that anyone with a little common sense would understand that if the Party's lines and policies did not reflect the will and aspirations of the vast majority of the people and did not have deep social and economic roots, mass movements as large as the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune would not be forcibly ordered by anyone or any force.

	Right-leaning opportunists slander our revolutionary mass movements as not being conscious actions of the masses. They always distort the Party's resolute support for advanced elements and the Party's enthusiastic support for new things as the Party being detached from the majority of the masses. Therefore, they despise or even hate advanced elements, and fear or even stifle new things. Why does the Party rely on advanced elements? The only reason is that advanced elements, in any era, are the pioneers of the forward development of human social history and the pioneers of the forward development of human economic and cultural life. In carrying out such a brand-new undertaking as socialist revolution and socialist construction, if there are no advanced elements to lead the way, we will accomplish nothing. It is not that relying on advanced elements will detach us from the majority of the masses; on the contrary, if we do not give play to the leading role, backbone role, and bridging role of advanced elements, we will lose the link to the masses, and the majority of the masses will leave us. As long as we can rely on advanced elements according to this change, we will always maintain the closest contact with the majority of the masses. As Chairman Mao said: "Communists must never detach themselves from the majority of the masses, disregard the situation of the majority of the people, and lead a small number of advanced teams to advance alone; they must pay attention to organizing close ties between advanced elements and the broad masses. This is the viewpoint of taking care of the majority." Was the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement just a separate rash advance by a small number of advanced elements, detached from the majority of the masses? Definitely not. During the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement, the broad masses rushed to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced, which is the most powerful proof.

	It can be seen from this that thoroughly refuting the fallacy of right-leaning opportunists who slander our revolutionary mass movements as not being conscious actions of the masses is a major issue in our struggle against right-leaning opportunists. This struggle is a reflection of the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism within the revolutionary ranks, and it is also a fierce and profound class struggle within the revolutionary ranks. This struggle is related to the issue of whether or not to have revolutionary mass movements, and it is related to the success or failure of socialist construction.

	(Excerpted from the editorial of the 11th issue of "Forward" in Shanxi, "Who Says Our Revolutionary Mass Movement Is Not a Conscious Action of the Masses?")

	Crush the "Spontaneity Theory" Towards Revolutionary Mass Movements

	How to treat revolutionary mass movements has always been the dividing line between Marxists and non-Marxists. Since last year, in addition to treating our vigorous revolutionary mass movements with a bourgeois master-like attitude, some right-leaning opportunists have also been actively promoting the spontaneous movement of the masses, in an attempt to weaken and oppose the Party's leadership over the mass movement. In many practical issues such as formulating production targets and carrying out labor competitions, they unilaterally emphasized "bottom-up" deliberation and action, opposed "top-down" target setting, and opposed "top-down" calls. They said that "only from the bottom up can it be deeply rooted and flourish, and the foundation is solid."

	Marxists have always believed that although the working class spontaneously tends towards socialism, and the working peasants also have a tendency towards socialism, in the old society, because they did not have the time and conditions to enjoy the historical wealth of science, and they were politically and spiritually enslaved, they themselves could not create socialist consciousness. Socialist consciousness "grows out of the philosophical, historical and economic theories created by educated people from the propertied classes, intellectuals. The founders of modern scientific socialism, Marx and Engels themselves, were, by their social status, bourgeois intellectuals." (Lenin: "What is to be Done?") If we simply rely on the spontaneous movement of workers, it can only produce trade unionist consciousness, that is to say, only realize that it is necessary to fight for the improvement of the conditions of selling labor, and not realize that it is necessary to overthrow the capitalist system and establish a socialist system; while peasants can only spontaneously move towards capitalism. Therefore, Marxists have always insisted that socialist ideology must be instilled into the workers and peasants from the outside. This was the case in the past, and it is still the case today.

	It would be wrong to think that our socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts has already achieved a decisive victory today, and the level of consciousness of the people has been significantly improved, and we can relax the socialist and communist ideological education of the people. It should be known that the transformation of our old economic system has not been completely completed, capitalists are still receiving fixed interest, and there are still some privately owned means of production and private primary markets in rural areas; the reactionary ideological and political activities in urban and rural areas have not been completely eliminated, and the transformation of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists is still in progress. What is particularly noteworthy is that the habits of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie will exist for a considerable period of time. All this shows that in the transitional period, bourgeois ideology still exists very stubbornly and affects the people every day and every hour. The question can only be posed in this way: either socialist ideology takes command, or capitalist ideology takes command. If socialism does not occupy the position, capitalism will definitely come to occupy it.

	Therefore, if the proletariat and the working people want to achieve liberation and create a happy life, they must have their own headquarters, rely on the leadership of the headquarters, and point out the correct direction of struggle. In China, this headquarters is the Communist Party of China. Not only is it necessary to need and strengthen the Party's leadership during the revolutionary period, but the Party's leadership cannot be ignored and relaxed in the construction period. Without a party armed with Marxism-Leninism, formulating correct guidelines and policies based on the objective laws of socialist economic development, summarizing the experience of the masses, boosting the enthusiasm of the masses, and organizing and leading the masses to fight against nature and the remaining class enemies, it would be fundamentally impossible to complete the socialist construction cause. The so-called "bottom-up" mass movement of right-leaning opportunists actually denies and cancels the Party's leadership, and canceling the Party's leadership and canceling the socialist and communist ideological education of the masses, the mass movement will inevitably lose its direction and fail to develop healthily, and there will never be any real "deep roots and lush foliage, solid foundation and flourishing branches" and "solid foundation".

	Are we not to have "bottom-up"? No, that is not the case. We want "bottom-up", but this is only one aspect of the matter. On the other hand, we also want "top-down", and organically combine the two.

	The combination of "bottom-up" and "top-down" is actually what we usually call "the combination of leadership and the masses" and "from the masses, to the masses". The reason why we do this is because: on the one hand, we always believe that the people are the creators of history and have great creativity. We firmly believe in the wisdom and strength of the masses, so no matter what, we must humbly listen to the opinions of the masses and mobilize the masses to complete it themselves, and resolutely oppose all viewpoints and styles of "bestowing," "handling everything," and "commandism"; on the other hand, we also believe that, due to the limitations of the masses in terms of ideological level and division of labor, plus they all raise questions from their own perspective, some opinions are not necessarily correct. Therefore, in the process of concentrating these opinions, the leadership must make efforts to sort out, analyze, criticize, and summarize under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, so that it truly represents the interests and will of the broad masses of the people. Only in this way, when we return to the masses, will we be supported by the masses. The general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism was precisely formulated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong using the principles of Marxism-Leninism, based on the interests and will of the 650 million people. Therefore, as soon as this general line was announced, it immediately became the guide for the masses' actions and unleashed unparalleled power. A sea vessel with a compass, if it does not have brave sailors to steer it, cannot sail to the other shore; however, a sea vessel with brave sailors, if it lacks a compass, it is extremely difficult to sail to the other shore through the vast sea, even if it can reach the other shore one day, but it does not know how many detours it will take, wasting much time and energy. We combine "bottom-up" and "top-down" is to let the brave sailors follow the correct direction and sail to the other shore.

    既要党的领导　又要群众的自觉
    驳右倾机会主义分子对革命群众运动的诬蔑
    没有群众的自觉就没有革命群众运动
    右倾机会主义分子诬蔑我们的革命群众运动不是群众自觉的行动。他们把一些干部工作作风上存在的个别强迫命令现象，曲解为党的路线、方针都是强加于群众头上的东西，而不是出于群众的自觉自愿。谁都知道，路线和方针同贯彻执行路线方针中所发生的个别缺点，是完全不同的两回事情。路线和方针的正确与否，对革命事业的成败具有决定的作用。工作作风和工作方法的某些个别缺点，决不能决定革命事业的成败。而且我们在确定了正确的路线和方针之后，对于工作作风和工作方法的问题，从来都是十分重视的，哪怕是个别的暂时的缺点和错误，都要认真地加以纠正。事实也是这样做了的。那么党的路线和方针是不是强加于群众头上的东西呢？决不是的。衡量党的路线方针是否正确，唯一的标志是，要看路线和方针是否反映了最大多数人民群众的最高利益，是否集中了最大多数人民群众的意志和愿望。那么1958年党所确定的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，以及在这条总路线指导下的大跃进和人民公社化运动，是不是最大多数人民群众的意志和愿望呢？
    实践是检验真理的标准。在这里，我们不妨说的稍远一点。大家知道，我国是一个“一穷二白”的国家，六亿五千万人民，迫切要求改变这个贫困的历史面貌。“穷则思变，要干，要革命”。究竟是变的快些好呢？还是慢些好呢？革命干劲大一点好呢？还是小一点好呢？这是我国社会主义建设两种根本不同的方法。这两种方法，在广大人民群众的实践中，作了反复的比较。1956年在社会主义三大改造胜利完成的基础上，人民群众鼓起了革命干劲，国民经济出现过一次跃进的形势。但当时有些人却刮起了一股右倾思想的邪风，把这次“跃进”说成是“冒进”。在这股邪风的影响下，1957年来了个反“冒进”，国民经济的发展出现了一个“马鞍形”，工农业生产和其他各项社会主义建设事业，慢腾腾地走了一年。多亏我们英明伟大的毛主席，及时纠正了这个反“冒进”的错误，并在全民整风和反右派斗争取得伟大胜利的基础上，人民群众鼓起了更大的革命干劲。从1957年冬开始，国民经济大跃进的形势又露头了。广大人民群众解放思想，破除迷信，敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格大兴，个个赶先进，人人争上游。右倾保守，甘居下游的思想，受到社会舆论的鄙弃。两种方法两种结果的鲜明对比，使广大的人民群众，从自己的实践中，得出了肯定的结论：坚决赞成多快好省的方法，坚决反对少慢差费的方法。正在这个时候，即在1958年5月间，党中央和毛主席集中了人民群众的这种强烈的愿望，及时地提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。党的总路线的公布，使人民群众冲天的革命干劲，像原子核爆炸一样地迸发出来，出现了以钢为纲，一马当先，万马奔腾的全面大跃进的局面。
    大跃进的步伐，促进了人民群众向往大集体的力量。他们肯定了1958年上半年许多高级农业生产合作社由小并大、试行政社合一、创办公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等各种集体福利事业是实现这个向往的好办法。就在这个时机，即在1958年7、8月间，党中央和毛主席，又抓住了人民群众的心愿，并且总结了人民群众试办人民公社的创造，提出了“人民公社好”的号召。这个号召，又一触即发地把最大多数人民群众的积极性掀动起来了。农民群众便建筑起自己心爱的新的大家庭——人民公社，它的光芒像太阳一般地普照大地了。
    从上述有目共睹的事实中，完全证明了党的路线和方针是从群众中来又到群众中去的，决不是什么人主观臆造出来的。实践也完全证明了，我们的党中央和毛主席是最善于集中人民群众的意志，最了解人民群众的愿望，最能代表人民群众的利益的。恐怕稍有一点常识的人都会理解，如果党的路线和方针，不是反映了最大多数人民群众的意志和愿望，没有深厚的社会经济根源，像大跃进和人民公社化这样规模宏大的群众运动，是任何人或者任何力量也不能强迫命令起来的。
    右倾机会主义分子诬蔑我们的革命群众运动不是群众的自觉行动，他们总是把党对先进分子的坚决支持，党对新鲜事物的热情扶植，曲解为党脱离了大多数群众。因而他们鄙视甚至仇恨先进分子，惧怕甚至扼杀新鲜事物。党为什么要依靠先进分子呢？唯一理由是，因为先进分子在任何时代，都是人类社会历史向前发展的前驱，是人类经济生活、文化生活向前发展的前驱。在进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设这样崭新的事业中，如果没有先进分子打先锋，我们将会一事无成。不是依靠了先进分子就会脱离多数群众，相反，如果不去发挥先进分子的带头作用，骨干作用，桥梁作用，我们就失去了联系群众的纽带，多数群众就会离开我们。只要我们能够根据这种变化，去依靠先进分子，那就永远会与多数群众保持最密切的联系。正像毛主席所说的：“共产党员决不可脱离群众的多数，置多数人的情况于不顾，而率领少数先进队伍单独冒进；必须注意组织先进分子和广大群众之间的密切联系。这就是照顾多数的观点。”大跃进和人民公社化运动，是不是只是少数先进分子单独的冒进而脱离了多数群众呢？肯定不是的。在大跃进和人民公社化运动中，广大群众争先恐后地展开学先进、赶先进、超先进的运动，就是最有力的证明。
    由此可见，彻底驳倒右倾机会主义分子诬蔑我们的革命群众运动不是群众的自觉行动的谬论，是我们同右倾机会主义分子斗争的一个重大问题。这种斗争，是资本主义和社会主义两条道路斗争在革命队伍内的反映，也是一场激烈的深刻的阶级斗争在革命队伍内的反映。这种斗争是关系到要不要革命的群众运动的问题，是关系到社会主义建设成败的问题。
      （摘自山西“前进”第十一期社论“谁说我们的革命群众运动不是群众的自觉行动？”）
    粉碎对待革命群众运动的“自发论”
    如何对待革命的群众运动，从来是马克思主义者与非马克思主义者的分界线。去年以来，右倾机会主义分子除了以资产阶级老爷式的态度来对待我国轰轰烈烈的革命群众运动以外，他们中也有人在积极地宣扬群众的自发运动，力图削弱和反对党对群众运动的领导。他们在制订包产指标和开展劳动竞赛等许多实际问题上，片面地强调“自下而上”的酝酿和行动，反对“自上而下”的提指标，反对“自上而下”的号召。说什么“只有自下而上才能根深叶茂，本固枝荣”。
    马克思主义者从来认为，工人阶级虽然自发地倾向于社会主义，劳动农民也有趋向于社会主义的一面，但是在旧社会里，由于没有时间和条件去享受历史上的科学财富，而且政治上、精神上都处于被奴役的地位，他们本身却不能创造社会主义的意识。社会主义的意识，“是由有产阶级中学识丰富的人即知识分子创造的哲学、历史和经济的理论中成长起来的。现代科学社会主义的创始人马克思和恩格斯本人，按他们的社会地位来说，也曾经是资产阶级的知识分子。”（列宁：“怎么办？”）如果单纯依靠工人的自发运动，只能是产生工联主义的意识，也就是说，只意识到必须为改善出卖劳动力条件而斗争，而没有意识到必须推翻资本主义制度，建立社会主义制度；而农民则只能是自发地走向资本主义。因此，马克思主义者一向坚持必须把社会主义思想意识从外面灌输到工农群众中去。过去是这样，今天还是这样。
    如果以为我国今天在经济、政治和思想战线上的社会主义革命已经取得了决定性胜利，人民群众的觉悟程度已有了显著的提高，就可以放松对人民群众进行社会主义和共产主义的思想教育，那就错了。要知道，我国旧的经济制度的改造工作并没有彻底完成，资本家还在拿定息，农村还有一部分私有的生产资料和私人活动的初级市场；城乡反动的思想活动和政治活动也没有彻底消灭，地、富、反、坏、右等类分子的改造还在继续进行，特别值得注意的是，资产阶级和小资产阶级的习惯势力还会在相当长的时间中存在。这一切都表明：在过渡时期中，资产阶级的思想仍然是很顽强地存在着，并且每日每时地影响着人民群众。问题就只能是这样摆着：要就是社会主义思想挂帅，要就是资本主义思想挂帅。社会主义不去占领阵地，资本主义就一定来占领。
    因此，无产阶级和劳动人民要想获得解放，创造幸福的生活，必须有自己的司令部，依靠司令部的领导，给以指出正确的斗争方向。在中国，这个司令部就是中国共产党。不仅在革命时期需要和加强党的领导，建设时期也丝毫不能忽视和放松党的领导。如果没有以马克思列宁主义武装起来的党，依据社会主义经济的客观发展规律，制定出正确的方针政策，总结群众的经验，鼓足群众的干劲，组织领导群众向自然界和残余的阶级敌人作斗争，要完成社会主义建设事业，那是根本不可能的。右倾机会主义分子的所谓“自下而上”的群众运动实际上是否定和取消了党的领导，而取消了党的领导，取消了对群众的社会主义和共产主义的思想教育，群众运动必然会迷失方向，得不到健康发展，就决不会有什么真正的“根深叶茂，本固枝荣”、“基础巩固”。
    我们是不是不要“自下而上”呢？不，决不是这样。我们是要“自下而上”的，但这仅是事情的一方面，另一方面，我们还要“自上而下”，并且把这两者有机地结合起来。
    所谓“自下而上”和“自上而下”的结合，实际上也就是我们通常说的“领导和群众相结合”、“从群众中来，到群众中去”。我们所以这样做是由于：一方面，我们始终认定，人民群众是历史的创造者，具有伟大的创造力，我们坚信群众的智慧和力量，因此不论什么事情，总是要虚心地听取群众的意见，发动群众自己去完成，坚决反对一切“恩赐”、“包办代替”和“强迫命令”的观点和作风；另一方面，我们又认为，由于群众受着思想水平和分工等条件的限制，加上他们都是从自己的角度来提问题，有些意见不一定是正确的，因此领导在集中这些意见过程中，必须在马克思列宁主义的思想指导下，做一番整理、分析、批判和概括的工夫，使之真正代表广大人民群众的利益和意志。只有这样，再到群众中去，才会受到群众的拥护。鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义这条总路线，正是党中央和毛泽东同志运用马克思列宁主义的原理，根据六亿五千万人民的利益和意志制定出来的，因此，这条总路线一公布，立即成为群众行动的指南，并发出无比巨大的威力。一只具有指南针的海船，如果没有英勇的水手来驾驶，固然不可能驶向彼岸的；但是，一只具有英勇水手的海船，如果缺乏指南针，要通过茫茫的大海驶向彼岸，也是极端困难的，即使也有一天能够抵达彼岸，但这却不知道要走多少弯路，浪费多少时间和精力。我们把“自下而上”和“自上而下”结合起来，正是让英勇的水手们遵循正确的方向一直驶向彼岸。
