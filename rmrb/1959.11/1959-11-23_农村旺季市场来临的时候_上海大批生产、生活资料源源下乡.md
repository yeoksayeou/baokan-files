    As the Rural Peak Season Market Arrives
    Shanghai Ships Production and Living Materials to the Countryside in Large Quantities
    (Our newspaper, Shanghai, November 22nd) A large number of industrial products are being shipped from Shanghai to various regions to supply the rural market during the peak season following the bumper harvest. Since the beginning of November, an average of more than 5,000 tons of various means of production and daily necessities have been transported daily by land and water.
    Among the industrial products supplied by Shanghai's commercial departments in the fourth quarter, there has been a substantial increase in the means of production to meet the needs of the vast rural areas for building water conservancy projects this winter and next spring, and to accelerate agricultural technological transformation. Not only have small tools and equipment such as iron nails, lead wire, coal shovels, and sledgehammers exceeded the highest supply quantities of previous years, but also a large number of electrical equipment, instruments, and accessories for tractors and internal combustion engines. There are 1.58 million inner and outer tires for handcarts and 380,000 cart wheels needed for short-distance transportation in rural areas, representing increases of one-third and nearly two times respectively compared to the supply volume in the third quarter. To support the upsurge in livestock breeding and pig raising in various people's communes this winter, the veterinary equipment, medicines, and artificial insemination equipment dispatched this quarter are equivalent to the total supply performance of the last six months of last year. In terms of daily necessities, the supply of cold-weather products such as dark-colored printed cloth, undershirts and pants, cotton sweaters, yarn scarves, flannel gloves, cotton blankets, snow caps, and felt hats has also increased by 10% to nearly double compared to last year.
    In organizing purchases, Shanghai's commercial departments actively assist relevant factories in adjusting production and trial-producing new products, striving to make the variety of goods meet the needs of rural areas. The supply of open-front undershirts, which are easy to put on and take off and have always been popular among farmers, has increased by more than 40% compared to last year. In terms of sales arrangements, Shanghai's commercial departments prioritize the supply of daily necessities such as flashlights, batteries, bamboo-shell thermos bottles, tin locks, and metal hairpins, which are currently needed in both urban and rural areas, to the countryside.
    The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China requires employees of relevant commercial departments to exert their efforts, strive to overfulfill the industrial product allocation plan by a greater margin, support the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, and supply the needs of farmers' production and life. At present, commercial departments have completed more than 95% of the state's industrial product procurement plan for this year. For commodities that have already been signed purchase and sales contracts with various regions and currently have large inventories, shipments are expedited as much as possible. (Attached picture)

    农村旺季市场来临的时候
    上海大批生产、生活资料源源下乡
    本报上海22日电　大批工业品正从上海源源运往各地，供应大丰收后的农村市场旺季。进入11月份以来，通过水陆两路从这里运出的各种生产资料和生活用品，平均每天有五千多吨。
    上海商业部门第四季度供应的工业品中，适应广大农村今冬明春兴修水利工程和加速进行农业技术改造需要的生产资料大量增加。不仅元钉、铅丝、煤锹、鎯头等小型工具器材，超过了往年的最高供应数量，还有大批电器设备、仪器仪表和拖拉机、内燃机配件。农村大搞短途运输需要的力车内外胎有一百五十八万条，力车轮有三十八万个，分别比第三季度供应量增长三分之一和近二倍。为了支援各地人民公社冬季牲畜配种和养猪高潮，这个季度调出的兽医器械、药品和人工授精器具，相当去年下半年六个月供应实绩的总和。在日用品方面，当令的深色花布、卫生衫裤、棉毛衫袄、线围巾、绒布手套、棉毯、风雪帽、块呢帽等御寒用品，今年供应量也分别比去年增加10％到近一倍。
    上海商业部门在组织进货中，积极协助有关工厂调剂生产，试制新产品，尽量使商品的花色品种满足农村需要。穿脱方便，一向为农民喜爱的开襟卫生衫，今年供应量比去年上升40％以上。在商品的销售安排上，上海商业部门对电筒、电池、竹壳热水瓶、铁皮锁、金属发夹等部分目前城乡都需要的日用品都优先供应农村。
    中共上海市委要求有关商业部门职工鼓足干劲，争取更多地超额完成工业品调拨计划，支持农副产品收购，供应农民生产和生活的需要。目前商业部门已完成国家下达的今年工业品采购计划的95％以上。凡是已经和各地签订购销合同而目前库存又较多的商品，尽量提前发货。（附图片）
