Solipsism in the History of Philosophy
　　　　Wang Che

The term "solipsism" in philosophy refers to a thought that only my own existence is real, and the whole world, including other people, is nothing but my experience and my feelings. Methodologically, solipsism believes that only my own feelings are the only reliable evidence of truth, and I cannot believe anything other than my own feelings. In addition, the term solipsism is sometimes used to refer to a moral point of view that only my own interests are the purpose and standard of all my actions; this kind of solipsism is also egoism.

All subjective idealism, if carried through to the end, inevitably leads to solipsism. In China, the representative of solipsism is the "Lu-Wang School."

"The universe is my mind, and my mind is the universe." (Lu Jiuyuan)

"There is no principle outside the mind, and no object outside the mind." (Wang Yangming)

"If there is an idea, there is an object; if there is no idea, there is no object." (Wang Yangming)

Among these figures, the most thorough expression is probably Yang Jian (Cihu). He said in "Yi Yi":

"Since the birth of mankind, no one has been able to fully understand me. Only by seeing the vast and clear sky above can one who can speak name it 'heaven'; and by seeing the collapsed and broad earth below, one can name it 'earth'. The clarity is my clarity; the breadth is my breadth; but people do not know it themselves. People do not know it themselves, and they point to and name them as that heaven and that earth; it is like not knowing that they are my hands and feet, and saying that they are that hand and that foot, like not knowing that they are my ears, eyes, nose, and mouth, and saying that they are that ears, eyes, nose, and mouth, which is no wonder! ...That which constitutes me is not merely blood, qi, form, and appearance. My nature is clear and bright and not an object, and my nature is vast and boundless and not a quantity. Heaven is an image in my nature; earth is a form in my nature. Therefore, it is said, 'In heaven it becomes an image, on earth it takes shape,' all of which are done by me."

Heaven and earth and all things belong to me, like my hands, feet, ears, and eyes. This is a naked and bold (actually arrogant) declaration of solipsism. This is indeed a kind of "self-expansion," and such a "self" is no longer a person but a god. Lenin said that idealism is to develop (inflate, expand) a certain characteristic or aspect of knowledge, making it "separated from matter, separated from nature, and deified as absolute" (Philosophical Notebooks). Solipsism is to infinitely "inflate" the self, turning it into a deified absolute. But this kind of extreme subjective idealism is difficult to be accepted by common sense; to defend it, one can only resort to sophistry. "Instructions for Practical Living" records such an event of Wang Yangming:

"The teacher was traveling in Nanling. A friend pointed to a flower tree in the rock and asked: The world has no objects outside the mind. Such a flower tree, blooming and falling in the deep mountains, what does it have to do with my mind? The teacher said: Before you saw this flower, this flower and your mind both returned to silence; when you see this flower, then the color of this flower suddenly becomes clear, and then you know that this flower is not outside your mind."

In fact, "before seeing this flower," one can only say that the concept or impression of "this flower" does not yet exist in the mind; "when you see this flower," the "color of this flower" only becomes "clear" in the mind of the flower viewer. Wang Yangming already confused the objective flower with the reflection of this flower in people's consciousness in his argument, so it is just sophistry.

Subjective idealists inevitably encounter this problem, so they also have to find ways to escape it. Let's see how Western idealist philosophers play tricks.

When mentioning Western subjective idealism, people will naturally think of Berkeley. Indeed, Berkeley can be said to be the founder of Western subjective idealism, and various schools of modern and contemporary subjective idealism are related to Berkeley. Berkeley's main conclusions can be found in this passage from his book "A treatise concerning the principles of human knowledge":

"All the choir of heaven and furniture of the Earth, in word all these bodies which compose the mighty frame of the world, have not any subsistence without a mind, that their being is to be perceived or known; that consequently either they are actually perceived by me or else do not exist at all or else subsist in the mind of some eternal spirit." The word "or else" in this last sentence is very important; Berkeley used this "or else" to partially change his philosophy from subjective idealism to objective idealism. Why do this? There are two reasons: one is that the argument of subjective idealism, if carried through to the end, will inevitably fall into absurd solipsism; the other is that Berkeley's original purpose was also to prove the existence of God.

"To be is to be perceived," this is Berkeley's fundamental proposition. But according to this point, as soon as I close my eyes, do the things in front of me cease to exist? Berkeley replied: As long as others see them, then these things still exist in the minds of others. But what if these things are not seen by anyone? Berkeley replied: Then they exist in the mind of God. In this way, idealism directly leads to religious conclusions.

In the camp of subjective idealism, following Berkeley is Hume. Berkeley tried hard to avoid falling into the quagmire of solipsism, but Hume pointed out that doing so is incomplete. Hume believed that if strictly following the principles of subjective idealism, I can never "go beyond" my own feelings and experiences. I cannot believe in the existence of external material objects, nor can I believe in the existence of things like the mind or soul; not only are things just a bundle of perceptions, but even my own mind is just a bundle of perceptions. Apart from such a bundle of constantly changing impressions and ideas, I can no longer see what else is the mind. In this way, Hume reached a more thorough solipsism.

How did Hume treat this conclusion of his own philosophy? In "A Treatise of Human Nature," Hume said: "My philosophy places me in such a desperate and solitary situation that I initially feel panic and confusion..." Therefore, he had to escape from it. "The best thing is that although reason cannot dispel these dark clouds, nature itself can do the job, and cure my philosophical depression and delirium, or revitalize my thinking, or use some external affairs, with active sensory impressions, to eliminate all these fantasies. I eat, I play backgammon, I talk, I have fun with friends; after spending three or four hours, I look back at these speculations, and they seem so cold, forced, and ridiculous that I am determined to live, talk, and act like others who live ordinary lives." Here, Hume himself declared the bankruptcy of his solipsistic ideas. All solipsism cannot but fall into this contradiction.

Taking the path of objective idealism eventually leads to God; taking the path of subjective idealism eventually leads to solipsism: for idealists, there is no other way.

Because solipsism is too absurd, there are not many idealist philosophers who dare to openly advocate it, but all subjective idealist ideas are actually connected to solipsism, only they try their best to conceal it.

### 哲学史上的唯我主义

    哲学史上的唯我主义
    王澈
    哲学上“唯我主义”这个名词是指这样一种思想，就是认为只有我自己的存在是真实的，而整个世界，包括别的人在内，都不过是我的经验，我的感觉。表现在方法论上，唯我主义认为只有我自己的感觉才是真理的唯一可靠的证据，我除了相信自己的感觉以外，不能相信任何别的东西。另外，唯我主义这个名词有时还用来指这样一种道德观点，就是认为只有我自己的利益才是我的一切行为的目的和标准；这种唯我主义也就是利己主义。
    一切主观唯心主义如果贯彻到底，都不可避免地走到唯我主义。在中国，代表唯我主义的是“陆王学派”。
    “宇宙便是吾心，吾心便是宇宙。”（陆九渊）
    “无心外之理，无心外之物。”（王阳明）
    “有是意，即有是物；无是意，即无是物。”（王阳明）
    这一派人物里，表现得最彻底的大概要算杨简（慈湖）了。他在“已易”中说：
    “自生民以来，未有能识吾之全者。唯睹夫苍苍而清明而在上，始能言者，名之曰天；又睹夫隤然而博厚而在下，又名之曰地。清明者，吾之清明；博厚者，吾之博厚：而人不自知也。人不自知，而相与指名曰彼天也，彼地也；如不自知其为我之手足，而曰彼手也，彼足也，如不自知其为己之耳目鼻口，而曰彼耳目也，彼鼻口也，是无惑乎！……夫所以为我者，毋曰血气形貌而已也。吾性澄然清明而非物，吾性洞然无际而非量。天者，吾性中之象；地者，吾性中之形。故曰‘在天成象，在地成形’，皆我之所为也。”
    天地万物都属于我，好像我的手足耳目一样。这是赤裸裸的唯我主义的大胆（实际是狂妄）的宣言。这的确是一种“自我扩张”，这样的“我”已经不是人而是神了。列宁说，唯心主义是把认识的某一个特征或方面加以发展（膨胀、扩大），使它变成“脱离了物质、脱离了自然的、神化了的绝对”（哲学笔记）。唯我主义就是把自我加以无限的“膨胀”，变成了神化的绝对。但是这种极端的主观唯心主义，是很难为常识所接受的；要为它辩护，只有强词夺理。“传习录”记载着王阳明这样一件事：
    “先生游南岭。一友指岩中花树问曰：天下无心外之物，如此花树，在深山中自开自落，于我心亦何相关？先生曰：你未看此花时，此花与汝心同归于寂；你来看此花时，则此花颜色一时明白起来，便知此花不在你的心外。”
    实际上，“未看此花时”，只能说“此花”的观念或印象还不存在于心中；“来看此花时”，“此花颜色”才在看花人的心中“一时明白起来”。王阳明在论证中就已经把客观的花和这花在人的意识中的反映混同起来，所以不过是诡辩而已。
    主观唯心主义者都难免碰到这个难题，所以也都要想法逃脱它。我们来看看西方唯心主义哲学家是怎样耍花样的。
    提到西方的主观唯心主义，人们会很自然地想到柏克莱。的确，柏克莱可说是西方主观唯心主义的开山祖师，近代和现代的主观唯心主义各种流派，都是和柏克莱有关的。柏克莱的主要结论，见于他的“人类知识原理”一书中的这样一段话：
      “天上的一切星宿，地上的一切陈设，总之，构成大宇宙的一切物体，在心灵以外都没有任何存在；它们的存在就是被感知或被知道；因此，如果它们不是实际上为我所感知，或者不存在于我或任何别的被创造的精神的心中，那么，它们便根本不能存在，否则就是存在于一种‘永恒的精神’的心中。”这最后一句的“否则”两个字是很重要的；柏克莱用这一个“否则”就部分地把他的哲学从主观唯心主义变成客观唯心主义了。为什么要这样做呢？原因有两个：一个是主观唯心主义的论证如果贯彻到底，必然陷入荒谬绝伦的唯我主义；一个是柏克莱的本来目的也是在于证明上帝的存在。
    “存在即是被知觉”，这是柏克莱的根本命题。但是根据这一点，我一闭上眼睛，面前的事物是不是就不存在了呢？柏克莱答复说：只要还有别人看到它们，那么这些事物还在别人的心中存在。但是，如果这些事物没有被任何人看到时又怎样呢？柏克莱答复说：那时它们是存在于上帝的心灵中。这样，唯心主义就直接引到了宗教的结论。
    在主观唯心主义的阵营里，紧接着柏克莱的是休谟。柏克莱竭力想避免陷入唯我主义的泥沼，休谟却指出了：这样做是不彻底的。休谟认为如果严格按照主观唯心主义的原则，我就永远不能“超出”我自己的感觉和经验。我不但不能相信外界物质对象的存在，也不能相信心灵或灵魂这一类东西的存在；不但事物只是一团知觉，就是我自己的心灵也不过是一团知觉，离开了这样一团前后相继不断变迁的印象和观念，我再也看不出此外还有什么心灵。这样，休谟就达到了比较彻底的唯我主义。
    休谟怎样对待他自己的哲学的这个结论呢？在“人性论”里，休谟说：“我的哲学把我置于那样绝望和孤寂的境地，我起初感到惊慌和迷乱……。”因此他非从这里面逃出来不可，“最侥幸的是，理性虽然不能驱散这些暗云，自然本身却可胜任，而把我这种哲学的忧郁症和狂谵症治愈，或则打活思路，或则以某些外务、以活跃的感官印象，消灭了所有这些幻想。我进食，我玩双六，我谈话，同朋友作乐；在消遣了三四个钟头之后，我回看这些思辨，它们就显得那样冷酷、勉强和可笑，因而我心中拿定主意要生活、谈话、行事，像过普通生活的他人一样了。”这里，休谟就自己宣告了他的唯我主义思想的破产。一切唯我主义是不能不陷于这种矛盾的。
    走客观唯心主义的路，最后是通向上帝；走主观唯心主义的路，最后是通向唯我主义：对于唯心主义者来说，别的路是没有的。
    唯我主义因为太过于荒谬了，所以敢于公然主张它的唯心主义哲学家是不多的，但是一切主观唯心主义思想在实际上都是和唯我主义相通的，只不过他们要尽力掩蔽而已。
