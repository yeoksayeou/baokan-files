Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 31st: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued its discussion of the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament over four days from the 27th to the 30th. At the afternoon session on the 28th, the Soviet and U.S. delegations jointly submitted a joint proposal on the issue of complete and thorough disarmament, which has been unanimously approved by the delegations participating in the Committee's discussions.

The full text of the Soviet-U.S. joint proposal is as follows:

"(The United Nations) General Assembly,

"Desiring to save succeeding generations from the scourge of a new and devastating war,

"For the purpose of putting an end completely and forever to the armaments race which has placed a heavy burden on mankind, and of using the resources thus released for the benefit of mankind,

"Wishing to promote the establishment of relations of trust and peaceful cooperation among States,

"Taking note of the resolution of the United Nations Disarmament Commission of 10 September 1959,

"Convinced that any progress towards the goal of complete and general disarmament under effective international control would be a contribution to the realization of these lofty aspirations,

"Considering that the question of complete and general disarmament is the most important one facing the world today,

"Requests Governments to exert every effort to achieve a constructive solution of this problem,

"Hereby submits to the United Nations Disarmament Committee the Declaration of the United Kingdom of 17 September 1959, and the Declaration of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics of 18 September 1959, and other proposals that have been submitted, and the records of the plenary meetings and the meetings of the First Committee on the issue of complete and thorough disarmament, and requests the Secretary-General to submit them to the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee for detailed discussion,

"Expresses the hope that measures leading to the goal of complete and general disarmament under effective international control will be drawn up in detail and agreed upon within the shortest possible period."

The head of the Soviet delegation, Kuznetsov, spoke at the meetings on the 27th and 28th. He noted with satisfaction that most delegations had given a very positive evaluation of the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, which was a significant and positive outcome of the Committee's discussions. Kuznetsov pointed out that the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament could completely eliminate the possibility of creating some kind of military advantage for this or that country. This proposal can completely eliminate the major obstacles encountered in the past when discussing disarmament issues.

Kuznetsov pointed out that the Soviet-U.S. joint proposal was the result of recent talks between the Soviet and U.S. delegations. He pointed out that the Soviet delegation had originally hoped to obtain a more affirmative resolution endorsing the Soviet declaration on complete and thorough disarmament, but, taking into account the positions of other parties, the Soviet delegation made some amendments to its draft. Kuznetsov expressed his belief that the Political Committee and the General Assembly would unanimously agree to this joint proposal. He said that the adoption of this proposal would be an important step in formulating practical measures to realize mankind's heartfelt desire—to save the people of all countries from the catastrophe of a devastating new war.

The Byelorussian representative, Kiselev, pointed out in his speech at the meeting on the 29th that the implementation of the Soviet's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament would be able to provide mankind with a very reliable guarantee for maintaining lasting world peace and would forever eliminate the use of force as a means of resolving disputes between countries. When talking about the disarmament proposals put forward by other countries, he said that the British disarmament plan had many positive factors worth noting. However, this plan also has serious shortcomings: first, the British plan does not specify a specific date for the implementation of disarmament, which makes the plan very imperfect. Second, the plan does not indicate that foreign bases on the territory of other countries must be eliminated. When talking about the U.S. position, Kiselev said that the U.S. placing the agreement on supervising disarmament in the first place would only create difficulties for solving the entire problem and increase many meaningless disputes. The Byelorussian representative also reminded the Committee to pay attention to the U.S.'s repeated clamor to intensify international tension. Kiselev finally expressed his hope that the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting in Geneva in January next year will do its utmost to overcome various difficulties and seek a solution to the disarmament problem that is acceptable to everyone.

Representatives from many other countries spoke at these meetings, all expressing their support for the Soviet-U.S. joint proposal. The Indonesian representative, Sastroamidjojo, called on the United Nations to do everything possible to convince the people of all countries that the disarmament negotiations would achieve satisfactory results. The Libyan representative, Fekini, said that his country was very concerned about the arms race and that the Libyan residents, like all peace-loving people, were very interested in solving the disarmament problem as quickly and thoroughly as possible. The head of the Saudi Arabian delegation, Shukairy, believed that the Soviet's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament was "accurate, clear and affirmative." When comparing the Soviet proposal with the British proposal, he said that what the British delegation called "comprehensive disarmament" was fundamentally different from the complete and thorough disarmament proposed by the Soviet Union. The Soviet proposal stipulates the complete abolition of military institutions and armed forces, while the British plan actually wants to retain them. Shukairy emphasized that if the British plan is based on general concepts, then the Soviet proposal demonstrates a new revolutionary attitude.

Considering the importance attached to the issue of complete and thorough disarmament both inside and outside the United Nations, the U.S. representative, Lodge, said in his speech that the United States would do its best to achieve good results in the talks of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee to be held at the beginning of next year. He added that the United States believes that "all-inclusive disarmament can be achieved through various paths and using various methods."

The British representative, Ormsby-Gore, said that it was rare in the recent past for the East and West to reach agreement on issues related to disarmament.

The French representative, Jules Moch, said that France would submit specific disarmament proposals to the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee and hoped that the work of this committee would achieve good results.

    苏美在联大政委会上提出联合提案希望
    就导向全面裁军措施达成协议
    主张把苏英和其他国家建议提交十国裁军委员会讨论
    新华社31日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会27日到30日四天内继续讨论苏联政府提出的全面和彻底裁军的建议。在28日下午会议上，苏联代表团和美国代表团联合提出了关于全面和彻底裁军问题的联合提案，这个提案已经得到参加委员会讨论的各代表团一致赞同。
    苏美联合提案全文如下：
    “（联合国）大会
    “由于希望使这一代和后代的人避免新的、毁灭性战争的威胁，
    “为了完全地、永远地结束使人类遭到沉重负担的军备竞赛，并使因此而腾出来的资源用来为人类造福，
    “希望促使各国之间建立信任和和平合作的关系，
    “注意到联合国裁军委员会1959年9月10日的决议，
    “深信在实现在有效的国际监督下全面和彻底裁军的目标方面的任何进展都将是对实现这些崇高愿望的贡献，
    “考虑到全面和彻底裁军问题是世界今天面临的最重要的问题，
    “要求各国政府尽一切力量使这个问题得到积极解决，
    “特此向联合国裁军委员会提出1959年9月17日联合王国的宣言和1959年9月18日苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的宣言以及其他已经提出的建议和历次全体会议和第一委员会历次会议讨论全面和彻底裁军问题的记录，并请求秘书长提交十国裁军委员会加以详细讨论，
    “表示希望能够在最短期间内详细拟订导向在有效的国际监督下的全面和彻底裁军的目标的措施，并就这些措施达成协议。”
    苏联代表团团长库兹?佐夫在27日和28日会议上发了言。他满意地指出，大多数代表团都对苏联政府提出的全面和彻底的裁军建议作了非常良好的评价，这是委员会的讨论的重大和良好的结果。库兹?佐夫指出，苏联提出的全面和彻底裁军的建议可以完全消除给这些或那些国家造成某种军事优势的可能性。这个建议完全可以消除过去在讨论裁军问题时碰到的重大障碍。
    库兹?佐夫指出，苏美联合提案是苏美两国代表团最近进行的会谈的结果。他指出，苏联代表团本来更希望能取得对苏联的全面和彻底裁军宣言更肯定地赞同的决议，但是，考虑到其他方面的立场，苏联代表团对自己的草案作了一些修改。库兹?佐夫表示相信，政治委员会和大会将一致同意这一联合提案。他说，采纳这个提案将是在制定实际措施以实现人类衷心的愿望——拯救各国人民免于毁灭性的新战争浩劫方面重要的一步。
    白俄罗斯代表基谢廖夫在29日会议上发言时指出，实现苏联的全面和彻底裁军建议将能够给人类提供维护世界持久和平的十分可靠的保证，永远排除把使用武力作为解决国与国之间的争执问题的手段。他在谈到其他国家提出的裁军建议时说，英国提出的裁军计划有许多积极因素是值得注意的。但是这个计划也有严重的缺点：第一，英国计划没有规定实行裁军的具体日期，这就使这个计划很不完善。第二，计划中没有指出必须消除在别国领土上的外国基地。基谢廖夫在谈到美国的立场时说，美国把关于监督裁军的协议提到第一位，这只会给解决全部问题造成困难，增加许多毫无意义的争辩。白俄罗斯代表还提醒委员会注意美国一再叫嚣要加剧国际紧张局势。基谢廖夫最后表示希望，明年1月在日内瓦集会的十国裁军委员会将会竭尽全力来克服各种困难，并谋求大家都能接受的解决裁军问题的办法。
    在这几天会议上发言的有其他许多国家的代表，他们都表示支持苏美联合提案。印度尼西亚代表沙斯特罗阿米佐约呼吁联合国竭尽一切努力使各国人民确信裁军谈判将获得圆满结果。利比亚代表菲基尼说，他的国家对军备竞赛感到非常忧虑，利比亚居民同所有爱好和平的人民一样，对最快地和彻底地解决裁军问题非常感兴趣。沙特阿拉伯代表团团长舒凯里认为苏联提出的全面和彻底裁军建议是“准确、明了和肯定的”。他在把苏联的建议同英国提出的建议作比较时说，英国代表团称为“全面裁军”的东西同苏联提出的全面和彻底裁军有着本质上的区别。苏联建议规定完全取消军事机构和武装部队，而英国的计划则实际上要保留它们。舒凯里着重指出，如果说英国的计划是基于一般的概念，那么苏联的建议则表明了一种新的革命的态度。
    考虑到联合国内外对全面和彻底裁军问题的重视，美国代表洛奇在发言中说，在明年年初举行的十国裁军委员会的会谈中，美国将尽全力来争取获得良好的结果。他又说，美国认为，“无所不包的裁军可以通过各种道路和用各种方法来达到”。
    英国代表奥姆斯比戈尔说，东西方之间在同裁军有关的问题上取得一致意见，这在不久以前还是罕见的现象。
    法国代表儒勒·莫克说，法国将向十国裁军委员会提出裁军的具体建议，并希望这个委员会的工作会得到良好的效果。
