    Setting Examples, Improving Systems, Continuous Inspection, and Constant Comparison:
    Beijing Focuses on Regular Sanitation Work

    (Our reporter Liu Peiheng reports) Building on the achievements of the patriotic sanitation campaign before National Day, the people of Beijing continue to exert great effort, actively carrying out regular work, combining the campaign with routine efforts, and continuously advancing the sanitation movement.

    Before National Day, the people of Beijing launched four large-scale sanitation blitzes, which greatly changed the city's sanitation. In October, after the blitzes ended, some people developed a sense of complacency and a "good enough" attitude, showing signs of relaxation. Sanitation leading organizations in each district, in conjunction with studying and discussing the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, launched a sanitation red flag competition among various industries, trades, and street residents. At the same time, according to different conditions, from the city and districts to various systems and regions, sanitation "pacesetters" were established as examples for the masses to learn from and as targets for continued advancement, setting off a new upsurge in the city's sanitation movement to compare with, learn from, and catch up with the advanced. The national sanitation red flag unit, the Fusujing Street Office, immediately became a model for all street offices in the city. Many residents' committees sent representatives to visit and learn. Some offices posted big-character posters expressing "Learn from Fusujing, catch up with Fusujing," striving to ensure that every household does a good job in regular sanitation work, achieving five cleanness (indoor, outdoor, streets, toilets, canteens) and three neatness (tableware, furniture, bedding). As a result, a large number of sanitation red flag units emerged in a short period, greatly improving residents' sanitation work. After the "pacesetter" of the Sanyuan Central Hotel was established in the service industry, many hotels came to this hotel to learn. The hotel's employees went to small hotels inside and outside Guang'anmen and in the Tianqiao area to guide and help them quickly catch up with the "pacesetter" level in sanitation work. Currently, the twenty-seven small hotels affiliated with the Sanyuan Central Hotel have basically reached the level of the Sanyuan Central Hotel, and have been commended by the District Patriotic Health Campaign Committee. In late October, the city selected 357 red flag units, more than three times the number last year. This method of setting examples and establishing banners has played a significant role in promoting regular sanitation work.

    In carrying out regular sanitation work, the city continuously organizes inspections and comparisons to institutionalize it. A system of inspections at all levels has now been formed throughout the city. Streets have "block" inspections, and residents and organizations jointly form inspection teams for inspections or spot checks. Each industry and system also has "vertical" inspections, with public places and service industries forming groups to inspect the sanitation of each unit. There are also circular inspections between districts, with Dongcheng District inspecting Xicheng District, and Xicheng District inspecting Xuanwu District. This crisscrossing inspection is not only large-scale and easy to encourage the masses to strive for excellence, but also allows them to learn from each other's experiences, learn from each other's strengths, and improve sanitation work. After visiting the Summer Palace, Beihai Park absorbed the experience of dividing "battlefields" and "four fixings" (fixing people, fixing tasks, fixing time, fixing measures), ensuring that everything is managed and everyone has something to do, which strengthened their confidence in continuing to do a good job in public place sanitation.

    The experience of Beijing's mass sanitation movement proves that timely absorbing the experience of the broad masses and establishing a sanitation system to consolidate it after a sanitation blitz is an important link in ensuring regular sanitation. At present, various industries and trades, such as factories, organizations, schools, the catering industry, residents, and suburban people's communes, have formulated sound sanitation systems based on their different situations. Many departments have included a monthly sanitation campaign in their work plans. Street residents not only persist in cleaning indoor and outdoor sanitation every day, but also generally schedule weekly or monthly "Patriotic Sanitation Days," with all residents mobilizing for a small or large cleanup one day a week or month. Some areas have established systems such as mobile red flag competitions. In addition to formulating a system for cleaning the environment every day, the catering industry has also formulated a sanitation inspection system based on its business characteristics. For example, cooks who stir-fry dishes are required to inspect food every day to ensure that they do not make rotten food, and the pier used for cutting vegetables and meat must be disinfected once. Many units have formulated very detailed and thorough systems to ensure regular sanitation. For example, the Beijing Railway Station staff, in response to the characteristics of a large area, high buildings, many wall glasses, and a large flow of people, formulated various systems such as a cleaning shift system and a division of responsibility system, so that they do not leave work until the cleaning is done and maintain regular sanitation.

    Currently, relevant sanitation units in Beijing have formed a core group to prepare operational procedures based on the experience of the masses on how to maintain regular sanitation in factories, construction sites, the catering industry, etc., to further improve the level of sanitation, so that they can be promoted. At the same time, the Municipal Patriotic Health Campaign Committee is formulating a "Sanitation Monthly Calendar," which, according to different seasons and sanitation requirements, determines the key sanitation work for each month and quarter, to further closely integrate regular and blitz sanitation work.

    In order to ensure the continuous advancement of the city's sanitation work, the relevant sanitation departments in Beijing also investigate the situation after each blitz, according to the law of disease occurrence, the living habits of the four pests, and the sanitation habits of the masses, grasp the key points, and promptly prepare for the next blitz. Before this autumn and winter sanitation campaign blitz, the patriotic sanitation departments in each district generally went deep into the base points to investigate the density of rat distribution, and invited experts to study the habits of domestic rats and ditch rats. Medical experts analyzed the laws of disease occurrence and prevention measures in autumn and winter, etc., and made early preparations for the three blitzes in the fourth quarter of this year, focusing on rat extermination, prevention and control of winter infectious diseases, and sparrow extermination, etc. They also combined the sanitation habits of the masses to arrange the New Year's cleanup, closely integrating the blitz and regular efforts, one link after another, so that the blitzes are prepared, centered, and ensure that the city's sanitation movement advances wave after wave.

    树立榜样　健全制度　不断检查　不断评比
    北京抓紧经常性卫生工作
    本报讯　记者刘佩珩报道：北京市广大人民在国庆节前爱国卫生突击运动已取得成绩的基础上继续鼓足干劲，积极开展经常性工作，把突击和经常结合起来，使卫生运动不断跃进。
    北京市人民在国庆节前开展了四次声势浩大的卫生大突击运动，使全市卫生面貌大改观。进入10月，在突击运动结束后，有的群众产生一种满足于现状和“差不多”的思想，表现出松劲情绪，各区卫生领导机构便结合学习和讨论党的八届八中全会文件，在各行各业和街道居民中展开了卫生红旗竞赛。同时，根据不同的条件，从市、区到各系统、地区，都树立了卫生“标兵”，作为群众学习的榜样和继续跃进的目标，掀起了全市人民比先进、学先进、赶先进的卫生运动新高潮。全国卫生红旗单位——福绥境街道办事处，立即成为全市各街道办事处的学习榜样，许多居民委员会派代表来参观学习，有的办事处当时就贴出大字报表示“学福绥境、赶福绥境”，力争家家户户搞好经常性卫生工作，做到五洁（室内、室外、街道、厕所、食堂）三整齐（食具、家具、被褥）。于是在一个短短的时期里出现了大量的卫生红旗单位，把居民的卫生工作大大提高了一步。服务性行业树立起三元中心旅店的“标兵”后，许多旅店来这个店学习，这个旅店的职工又分头到广安门内外及天桥一带的小旅店里指导和帮助它们把卫生工作迅速赶上“标兵”水平，目前三元中心旅店所属的二十七个小旅店都已基本上达到三元中心店的水平，受到区爱国卫生运动委员会的表扬。在10月下旬，全市评选出来的红旗单位即达三百五十七个，比去年增加了三倍多。这种树榜样、立旗帜的办法对带动经常化卫生工作起了很大的作用。
    全市在开展经常性卫生工作中，不断组织检查、评比，使它制度化，全市现已形成层层有检查的制度。街道上有“块块”检查，居民和机关等联合组成检查组进行检查或抽片检查。各行业各系统又有“条条”检查，公共场所和服务行业分别组成小组到各单位检查卫生状况。各区之间还有循环检查，东城区检查西城区，西城区检查宣武区。这样纵横交错的检查，不仅声势浩大，容易鼓舞群众争上游的干劲，还可以互相吸取经验，取长补短，改进卫生工作。北海公园参观了颐和园以后，吸收了划分“战地”、“四定”（定人、定事、定时、定措施），事事有人管，人人有事作等经验，坚定了他们继续搞好公共场所卫生工作的信心。
    北京的群众卫生运动的经验证明：在一个卫生突击运动后，及时吸取广大群众的经验，建立卫生制度把它巩固下来，是保证卫生经常化的一个重要环节。目前，工厂、机关、学校、饮食行业、居民和郊区人民公社等各行各业都根据其情况不同制定了健全的卫生制度。许多部门已把每月搞一次卫生运动列入工作的计划中。街道居民不仅坚持每天打扫室内、外的卫生，还普遍订了每周或每月的“爱国卫生日”，一周或一月都有一天全体居民总动员来一次小扫除或大扫除，有些地区建立流动红旗竞赛等制度。饮食行业除制订每天清扫环境卫生的制度外，都按业务特点订出了卫生检查制度。如炒菜的炊事员规定每天必须检查食品，保证不作腐烂食品，切菜、切肉用的墩子，要消毒一次。许多单位制订出保证卫生经常化的制度十分细致周密。如北京车站职工针对面积大、建筑物高、墙面玻璃多、行人流动量大等特点，制订了清洁交班制、分片包干等各项制度，作到打扫不清洁不下班，保持卫生经常化。
    目前，北京市有关卫生单位，已组成核心小组，准备对工厂、工地、饮食行业等方面如何保持卫生经常化，根据群众的经验制定出操作规程，进一步提高卫生水平，以便加以推广。同时市爱国卫生运动委员会正在制订“卫生月份牌”，按着不同季节和卫生要求，确定出每月每季度的卫生重点工作，进一步使经常和突击的卫生工作密切结合起来。
    北京市爱国卫生有关部门为了保证全市卫生工作不断跃进，还在每次突击运动后，根据疾病发生规律、四害生活习性和群众卫生习惯，摸清情况，抓住重点，及时作好下次突击运动的准备工作。在这次秋冬季卫生运动突击前，各区爱国卫生部门普遍深入基点，调查老鼠分布的密度，并邀请专家研究家鼠、沟鼠的习性，由医学专家分析秋冬季疾病发生的规律及预防措施等，及早作好今年第四季度以灭鼠、防治冬季疾病的传染、灭雀等为中心的三次突击运动的准备工作，并结合群众卫生习惯安排了新年的大扫除，把突击和经常密切结合起来，一环套一环，使突击运动做到有准备、有中心，保证全市卫生运动一浪赶一浪的不断前进。
