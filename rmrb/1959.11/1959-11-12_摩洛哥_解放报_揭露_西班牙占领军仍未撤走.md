Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, November 9th. The Moroccan newspaper "Al-Istiqlal" revealed today the truth about the so-called withdrawal of Spanish troops from northern Morocco. It said, "Spanish troops have not withdrawn from this area."

After the Spanish Minister of the Army, Antonio Barroso, issued a statement, "Al-Istiqlal" sent a reporter to North Morocco for an interview. The newspaper today published a lengthy report from its reporter.

The report pointed out that 40,000 Spanish troops were occupying 85 strongholds. Spanish troops are concentrated in the Ceuta area. Spanish troops still occupy the Tetouan airport, and the number of Spanish troops stationed at the airport has increased. The Spanish flag is hung on buildings. The army has blockaded areas near Ceuta and Melilla. Spanish officers are using the Spanish consulates in northern Morocco as their command posts.

The newspaper pointed out: The reason why Spain is concentrating its troops is because, in Spain's view, the most important thing after Morocco's independence is to strengthen its position in the extremely important Ceuta and Melilla military bases.

    摩洛哥“解放报”揭露
    西班牙占领军仍未撤走
    新华社拉巴特9日电　摩洛哥“解放报”今天揭露所谓西班牙军队撤出摩洛哥北部的真象。它说，“西班牙军队并没有撤出这个地区”。
    “解放报”在西班牙陆军部长安托尼奥·巴罗索发表声明以后，派遣记者去北摩洛哥进行采访。这家报纸今天用很大的篇幅刊载了该报记者发来的消息。
    这个消息指出，四万名西班牙军队占领着八十五个据点。西班牙军队集结在休达地区。西班牙军队仍然占领着得土安飞机场，而且驻在机场的西班牙军队人数增加了。西班牙国旗挂在建筑物上。军队封锁了休达和美利拉附近的地方。西班牙军官把在北摩洛哥的西班牙领事馆作为他们的司令部。
    这家报纸指出：西班牙之所以集结军队，是因为：在西班牙看来，摩洛哥独立以后，最重要的事就是加强它在极其重要的休达和美利拉军事基地的地位。
