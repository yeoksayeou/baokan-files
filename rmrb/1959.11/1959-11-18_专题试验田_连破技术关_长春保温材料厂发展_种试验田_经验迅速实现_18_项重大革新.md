    "Special Topic Experimental Plots" Continuously Break Through Technical Barriers
    Changchun Insulation Material Factory Develops "Planting Experimental Plots" Experience to Rapidly Achieve 18 Major Innovations
    (Our report) Changchun Insulation Material Factory's leading cadres, in the midst of a vigorous technical innovation movement, planted "special topic experimental plots" based on key production issues. This enabled the rapid implementation of major innovation projects in the technical innovation movement and their quick promotion, thereby guaranteeing a leap forward in production this year while reducing the workforce by more than 800 people. From January to October, the value of output increased by 2.37 times compared to the same period last year, the output increased by 1.4 times compared to the same period last year, the average product qualification rate increased by 3%, and costs were reduced by about 45%.
    When the factory's Party committee earnestly summarized last year's Great Leap Forward experience at the beginning of the year, they affirmed that carrying out technical revolution and technical innovation could overcome the difficulties of insufficient equipment capacity and insufficient labor force. Subsequently, the factory's Party committee held several meetings, carefully studied the key problems in the current production links, and determined 21 major innovation projects. At the same time, focusing on these projects, they organized all the factory's leading cadres and, while continuing to adhere to planting "experimental plots," assigned special topics according to the different production keys of each work section. In this way, the method of planting general experimental plots was developed into planting special topic experimental plots.
    Chen Pengzhu, the secretary of the factory's Party committee, and engineer Liu Ziyu planted the "coal-free circulating kiln" special topic experimental plot. In order to conquer this special topic, they went to the sintering group of the No. 2 insulation workshop to work alongside the workers, improving the kiln type and stacking brick blanks. Because all the workers in the workshop offered suggestions and created conditions for this innovation, it only took ten days from kiln modification to successful trial. The pulverizer sealing has been a key problem that this factory has not solved for a long time. This time, factory director Zhu Hongmou went to the pulverizing group of the No. 1 insulation workshop to work, study, and experiment with the workers. He quickly found the reasons why the problem had not been solved in the past, and together with the workers, he modified the pulverizer parts, axle levers, buckets, and gear assembly position design, so that this technical reform, which was originally planned to be completed in forty days, was completed in twenty days. After the No. 1 insulation workshop installed sealing devices on two pulverizers, the dust content in this workshop was reduced from more than 1,000 milligrams per cubic meter of air to 6 milligrams, and the crushing efficiency was increased by 50%. After Cao Guangyu, the chairman of the trade union, solved the problem of mechanized molding of lightweight bricks in the comprehensive workshop, not only were the workers liberated from heavy physical labor, but also the efficiency was increased by more than one time.
    Through the cadres planting special topic experimental plots, the entire factory has so far realized 18 of the 21 major innovation proposals put forward by the Party committee. 8,816 of the 10,732 proposals put forward by the masses have been applied to production, and some of the remaining proposals are also being actively tested.

    “专题试验田”连破技术关
    长春保温材料厂发展“种试验田”经验迅速实现18项重大革新
    本报讯　长春保温材料厂领导干部在大搞技术革新运动中，根据生产关键问题种“专题试验田”，使技术革新运动中的重大革新项目迅速实现，并很快推广，从而保证了今年在减少八百多人的条件下，生产获得了飞跃的发展。1至10月份的产值比去年同期增长了二点三七倍，产量比去年同期增长了一点四倍，产品合格率平均提高3％，成本降低45％左右。
    这个厂的党委在年初认真总结去年大跃进的经验时，肯定了开展技术革命和技术革新，就能克服设备能力不足和劳动力不足的困难。接着工厂党委先后召开了数次会议，仔细地研究了当前生产环节上的关键问题，确定了二十一项重大革新项目。同时，围绕这些项目，把全厂领导干部组织起来，在继续坚持种“试验田”的基础上，根据各工段不同的生产关键，分派专题。这样，就把一般种试验田的方法发展到种专题试验田。
    厂党委书记陈朋翥和工程师刘子玉种的是“无煤循环窑”专题试验田。为了攻下这个专题，他们就下到保温二车间烧成小组和工人一起劳动，改进窑型、码砖坯。由于全车间工人都为这项革新出谋划策，创造条件，因此从改窑到试验成功，只用了十天的时间。粉碎机密闭是这个厂长期以来没有解决的关键问题。这次厂长朱鸿谋到保温一车间粉碎小组和工人同劳动、同研究、同试验以后，很快找出了过去没有解决问题的原因，和工人一起修改了粉碎机零件、轴杠、带斗、齿轮装配的位置设计，使原来计划四十天完成的这项技术改革，在二十天内就完成了。保温一车间把两台粉碎机装上了密闭装置后，这个车间由原来每立方米空气中含粉尘一千多毫克，减少到六毫克，碎料效率提高了50％。工会主席曹光宇在综合车间解决了轻质砖机械化成型以后，不仅使工人从繁重的体力劳动中解放出来，而且提高效率一倍以上。
    全厂通过干部种专题试验田，到现在为止，党委提出的二十一项重大革新建议，已有十八项实现了，群众提出的一万零七百三十二项建议，已有八千八百一十六项用在生产上，其余一些建议也正在积极试验中。　（魏文秀）
