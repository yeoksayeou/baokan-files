    Yunnan's Largest Fertilizer Plant
    The small contact sulfuric acid, oxygen, calcium carbide, and machine repair workshops of the newly built PLA Fertilizer Plant in Yunnan Province have recently been put into operation one after another. The construction of the synthetic ammonia workshop is currently being accelerated. This fertilizer plant, currently the largest in Yunnan Province, was initiated last year by the "August 1st" People's Liberation Army units in the Kunming area to support agricultural production in the border areas. It was later transferred to the industrial departments of Yunnan Province.

    云南最大的化肥厂
    云南省新建解放军化肥厂的小接触硫酸、氧气、电石、机修等车间，最近已先后投入生产。目前正在加速建设合成氨车间。这座云南省目前最大的化肥厂，是去年“八一”人民解放军昆明地区部队为了支援边疆农业生产而筹建的。后来又转交给云南省工业部门。
