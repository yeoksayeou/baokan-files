Congratulations to Yulin Prefecture for Comprehensive Desert Control

The Yulin Prefecture has begun comprehensive desert control. This marks a new era for the people of Yulin Prefecture in their struggle against the desert.

Under the oppression of reactionary rule, the people were powerless to resist the sandstorms. The only "way out" was to abandon their homes and flee to other places. This was the stage of escaping the sandstorms. After liberation, the People's Government organized and led the broad masses in a struggle against the sandstorms. They universally planted grass and trees on the edge of the desert, preventing the southward movement of the desert and initially controlling the harm caused by shifting sands. This was the stage of preventing sandstorms. Now, the people of the Yulin area have entered the third stage in their struggle against sandstorms: shifting from defense to offense, from simply controlling sand damage to utilizing the desert to create wealth, and the scope of desert control has also extended from the periphery to the hinterland of the desert. Although only a little over a year has passed, Yulin Prefecture has already built several large canals and some reservoirs in the sandy areas, and the newly developed water land is 71% more than the total of the previous eight years since liberation. This year, Yulin Prefecture's large-scale desert control project has already begun.

The people are still the same people, and the desert is still the same desert. Why has there been such a big change in the past year or so? Obviously, this is the result of the Great Leap Forward and the people's communization, and it is the result of the broad masses liberating their minds and giving full play to their energy. During the Great Leap Forward, people promoted the communist spirit, dared to think and act, and launched a struggle against the sandstorms with soaring enthusiasm, determined to be the masters of nature. They not only developed the experience of diverting water to wash away sand on small plots of desert in the past, but also further built large-scale reservoirs and canals to introduce water into the hinterland of the desert, and launched a movement to control sand with water. This approach, on the surface, seems to be just a change in the method of desert control. No, this is not simply a matter of method, but a matter of the relationship between man and nature. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, who have mastered their own destiny, are not only no longer willing to be slaves of nature, but also no longer willing to stay at the stage of simply preventing sandstorms, but to conquer the desert and become the masters of the desert. This change is formed by many factors and conditions, one of the most important of which is that under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of peasants have found the people's commune, a social organizational form with strong vitality and great superiority.

In the era of individual economy or even agricultural cooperatives, people were weak and could only plant some protective forest belts to protect the land and houses from damage or reduce damage. At that time, even if there were good methods, they could not be implemented. Only today, when the people's communes have been realized, is it possible to completely eradicate sandstorms. Because the commune is large in scale and wide in scope, it can formulate plans to completely eradicate sandstorms within a larger range, and can fully mobilize and rationally arrange manpower, financial resources, and materials to solve difficulties that could not be solved in the past. The fact that Niujiangliang Commune in Yulin County built the Yudong Canal is a good proof. When this canal was built before the establishment of the commune, there were many contradictions that could not be resolved, and it took seven months to build forty li; after the establishment of the commune, in just two months, in addition to building one hundred li of canals, two large reservoirs were also built.

The Great Leap Forward and the people's communization have enabled the people to enter a new stage in conquering nature and have won new victories. The desert control in Yulin Prefecture is one example, and the large-scale development of lake beaches and islands by the people of Jiangxi published in this newspaper the day before yesterday is also one example. Other examples, such as the construction of mountain canals in Wushan County, Gansu, and the water network of dry land in Huaibei, Anhui, are all important signs that the Chinese people's struggle against nature has entered a new stage. It can be predicted that such things will appear more and more on China's vast land.

### 贺榆林专区全面治理沙漠

专栏：短评

    贺榆林专区全面治理沙漠
    榆林专区开始全面治理沙漠了，这是榆林专区人民群众向沙漠作斗争进入新时期的标志。
    人民群众在反动统治压迫下对沙灾是无力抗拒的，唯一的“出路”是弃家逃亡，流落他乡。这是逃沙灾的阶段。解放后，人民政府组织和领导广大群众向沙灾展开斗争，在沙漠边沿普遍植草造林，制止了沙漠的南移，初步控制了流沙为害。这是防沙灾的阶段。现在，榆林地区的人民在同沙灾斗争中进入了第三个阶段：由防御转入了进攻，由单纯治沙害转为利用沙漠创造财富，治沙范围也由边沿深入到沙漠腹地。时间虽然仅仅过去了一年多，榆林专区已经在沙区修成几条大渠和一些水库，新开发的水地比解放以来前八年的总和还多了71％多。今年，榆林专区大规模治沙的工程又已开始了。
    人还是原来的人，沙漠仍旧是原来的沙漠，为什么在这一年多的时间内有这样大的变化呢？很明显，这是大跃进和人民公社化的结果，是广大群众解放思想、充分发挥干劲的结果。大跃进中，人们发扬了共产主义风格，敢想敢干，以冲天的干劲，展开了同沙灾的斗争，决心作自然界的主人。他们不仅发挥了过去在小块沙漠上引水冲沙的经验，并且更进一步大规模筑水库、修渠道，把水引进沙漠腹地，开展以水治沙运动。这种作法，表面上看来，好像仅仅是治沙方法上的一种改变。不，这不单纯是一个方法问题，而是人和自然的关系问题。在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，掌握了自己命运的我国人民，不仅不再甘愿作自然的奴隶，也不愿再停留在仅仅是防止沙灾的地步，而要征服沙漠，作沙漠的主人了。这种变化是由许多因素和条件形成的，其中很重要的一条就是在党领导下，广大农民找到了人民公社这个具有强大生命力和巨大优越性的社会组织形式。
    在个体经济甚至农业社时期，人们力量单薄，只能栽植一些防护性的林带，使土地、房屋不受或少受损失。那时候就是有良好的方法，也无法实施。只有在实现了人民公社化的今天，彻底根治沙灾才有可能。由于公社的规模大，范围广，可以在更大范围内制定根治沙灾的规划，可以充分动员和合理安排人力财力和物力，解决过去无法解决的困难。榆林县牛家梁公社修筑榆东渠的事实就是一个很好的证明。在公社成立以前修这条渠的时候有很多矛盾无法解决，七个月才修四十里；公社成立后仅两个月的时间，除修了一百里渠道外，还筑了两个大水库。
    大跃进和人民公社化，使人民群众在征服自然方面进入了新的阶段，获得了新的胜利。榆林专区治沙是一例，本报前天发表的江西人民大规模开发湖滩洲地也是一例，其他如甘肃武山县山上运河的修筑，安徽淮北旱地的水网化，等等，都是我国人民同大自然作斗争进入新阶段的重要标志。可以预见，这样的事情一定会越来越多地出现在我国广大的土地上。
