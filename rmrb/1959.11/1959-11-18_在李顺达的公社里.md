    In Li Shunda's Commune
    Zhan Chao
    Anyone who goes to the Taihang Mountains without venturing into the stony mountain areas of eastern Pingshun cannot be said to have truly experienced the Taihang Mountains. Here, each mountain surpasses the last, and the colors on the mountains change rapidly with the seasons, creating a truly magnificent spectacle.

    Leaving Pingshun City and heading south along the mountain gully for about twelve or thirteen *li*, you arrive at a very famous place – Xigou Village, the hometown of national model agricultural laborers Li Shunda and Shen Jilan. This road used to be very difficult to travel: during dry spells, the path was littered with stones of all sizes; when the rainy season arrived, flash floods could erupt at any time, and the muddy water would rampage through the gully like a ferocious beast, sweeping away even pedestrians. But now things have changed. In this mountain gully, which slopes upward from north to south, there is a high-quality gravel road wide enough for two cars to pass side by side in the middle, and newly renovated fertile beach land on either side. Further ahead is the militia reservoir. Now, people can walk safely whether it is sunny or rainy. Sometimes, when they encounter large trucks from Changzhi Steel Factory heading south to Xi'anli to haul ore, they can hitch a ride, and in the time it takes to smoke two pipes, they arrive at Xigou Village.

    There are probably tens or hundreds of villages named "Xigou" in the Taihang Mountains, but people only remember one: Li Shunda's Xigou Village. Last autumn, twenty-five advanced agricultural cooperatives within a radius of several dozen *li* united to form a people's commune. Although the center was in Longzhen, about ten *li* south of Xigou, the commune members insisted on calling it "Xigou People's Commune," or using the name of the Xigou Agricultural Cooperative, "Xigou Golden Star People's Commune," and they elected Li Shunda and Shen Jilan as the director and deputy director of their commune.

    These two commune leaders have always maintained the true qualities of model laborers. Although they hold positions, they have never left their production posts and still live in Xigou Village. Therefore, anyone who goes to the Golden Star People's Commune must first stop at Xigou Village. Walking in through the "Leap Forward Gate," there is a road that is not very wide but very clean in the center. Small pine and cypress trees are planted at equal intervals on both sides, and along the road are the homes of the commune members and the offices, canteens, elementary schools, kindergartens, etc., of the Xigou management area of the commune. The houses are all painted snow-white, and there are also touching color murals on the walls. In the middle of the village, the house with the highest roof and a "Glorious Military Family" plaque hanging in front of the door is Shen Jilan's home. Where does Li Shunda live? He lives in a string of cave dwellings on the hillside at the southern end of the village. The location is easy to recognize, but the person is not easy to find. Except for attending meetings outside, the two model laborers try to squeeze in time to work in the fields as soon as they return to the village, and eight or nine out of ten visits to their homes are unsuccessful.

    This is my second time in Xigou, and I seem to have figured out a pattern. I didn't go into the house but went straight to the fields. Sure enough, Li Shunda was leading a group of commune members in a rush to plant cabbage in a small piece of riverside land near the reservoir. They were working and talking and laughing, not seeming tired at all. At this time, a middle-aged woman on the edge of the field raised her voice and shouted: "Quick, 'Tight Grab', hurry up and hand over the cabbage seedlings!" Everyone burst into laughter. It turned out that "Tight Grab" was a nickname that people had recently given to Li Shunda. The story is this: Seeing that the autumn crops such as corn and millet had been planted almost completely, the model laborer proposed that, in addition to leaving a few strong laborers to rush to finish, the rest of the manpower should quickly switch over to planting more vegetables and other early-maturing crops in scattered vacant land. At first, some people's thinking was not clear, so he patiently persuaded and mobilized them, and he also seized the opportunity to take the lead in planting, which quickly opened up the situation and also influenced some other management areas and production teams.

    As a result of Li Shunda's "Tight Grab," Xigou Village completed its sowing plan ahead of schedule this year, and the sown area was also expanded. The day after I arrived, just after planting cabbage, the model laborer turned his attention to remote places such as mountain villages and sheds. We followed him to a mountain gully. This mountain gully is located on the west side of the village and is a veritable West Gully. Li Shunda escaped from famine in Linxian, Henan when he was a child and settled here. From the outside, Xigou doesn't seem very big, but the further you go in, the more open it becomes. After walking about four *li*, a fork suddenly appeared, and the mountain gully split into two on the left and right, extending all the way into the mountains behind. This place is called "Three Forks" and is inhabited by seven or eight households. Li Shunda used to rent land from the landlord here, and five *mu* of land was divided into eleven small pieces. After paying rent to the landlord for the grain harvested each year, there was not much left. After inspecting the work, the model laborer walked and told me about the history of the development of Xigou. Finally, he stood in front of a pear tree, gently stroking the trunk, and said with infinite affection: "This is the first 'rich root' we planted!" Indeed, this was the pear tree that Li Shunda grafted in the year the mutual aid group was established, following the direction of organization pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao. This tree is behind the house where he used to live. Nearby, there are also many pear, peach, and apricot trees of different sizes, which were also cultivated by Li Shunda himself during the period of the mutual aid group, the elementary cooperative, and the advanced cooperative, and they have now blossomed and borne fruit. It can be seen how deep the model laborer's feelings are for these fruit trees. He stroked them one by one, counting their ages. We lingered there for a long time, then climbed up a small hill next to it and looked into the distance. We saw countless low pine and cypress trees growing on the high mountains in front, behind, left, and right, while dense young apple trees and mountain peach and apricot trees grew on the sunny slopes. At this time, the model laborer couldn't help but open up his conversation. He said: "We peasants are like standing at this three-way intersection. There are two roads to take: one is like drilling into a dead mountain gully, the capitalist dead end where a few people get rich and the majority suffer; the other is like walking out of the gully, the bright road of socialism where we organize and become rich together. Fortunately, with the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our road is getting wider and wider." In more than ten years, the bare mountains and ridges of Xigou Village have gradually become a forest and orchard mountain. At this time, a few loud noises came from a distance, and the model laborer said with a smile: "This is the industry run by our people's commune, mining iron ore."

    In the evening, we returned to Xigou Village. It happened that the small generator with the steel mill was repaired, and the electric lights in the homes of the commune members and on the streets shone brightly. Although dinner time had passed, some people were gathered in the cafeteria, talking and laughing happily.

    The next morning, I left Xigou for Longzhen. The commune was holding a meeting of commune member representatives there to study production targets and collaborative projects between the management areas, and to hold a supplementary election of commune cadres. On this day, except for Shen Jilan who went to Beijing for a meeting, Li Shunda and other leading cadres of the commune were all there. Zhang Manyou, Secretary of the Xigou Golden Star People's Commune Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, said in his summary: "In the past, this mountain gully was a poor place. Since the commune was established, it is not only no longer poor, but we also have twenty farm tool repair and assembly plants, seven flour processing plants, five refractory brick factories, two mining sites, two hospitals, a veterinary station, an insemination station... These are like crops that have just emerged from the soil and are growing upward day by day. I heard that imperialism scolds our commune every day, so let it scold. Our people's commune cannot be smashed or broken."

    在李顺达的公社里
    展潮
    谁要是上太行山，而没有进入东部平顺一带的石头山区里去，那他就不能算是真正到过太行山。在这里，一座山赛过一座山，山上的颜色随着季节的交替在迅速地变换着，真可以说是气象万千，好看极了。
    出平顺城，沿着山沟一直朝南走，约莫十二、三里路，就到了一个很著名的地方——全国农业劳动模范李顺达、申纪兰的家乡西沟村。这条路本来是很难走的：在干旱的日子里，道上堆满着大大小小的乱石；雨季到了，说不定什么时候山洪暴发，混浊的流水就像一头猛兽似的，在山沟里横冲直闯，连行人也给卷走了。可是现在的情况变啦，在这道北低南高的山沟里，正当中是一条可以并排行驶两部汽车、由石子铺垫成的优质公路，两旁是新修整起的肥沃的滩地，再往前去就是民兵水库。这样，人们不论是晴天或雨天，都可以放心地走路了，有时遇着长治钢铁厂开来到南边的西安里去拉矿石的大卡车，还可以爬上去坐一程，抽两袋烟的功夫就来到了西沟村。
    叫“西沟”这样名字的村子，在太行山区可以数上成十、成百个，可是人们却只记住一个，就是李顺达的西沟村。去年秋天，方圆几十里地内的二十五个高级农业社联合起来成立人民公社，中心虽然在西沟南面十来里的龙镇，可是社员群众却主张还是叫“西沟人民公社”，或者沿用西沟农业社时的名称叫“西沟金星人民公社”，并且拥戴李顺达和申纪兰当自己公社的正、副主任。
    这两位公社正、副主任始终保持着劳动模范的本色，他们虽然担任着工作，却从来没有脱离开过生产岗位，照旧还住在西沟村里。因此，凡是去金星人民公社的人，总要先到西沟村落脚。通过“跃进门”走进去，正中是一条不很宽阔、却很整洁的道路，两侧等距离地栽种着一些小松柏树，路边是社员们的住家和公社西沟管理区的办公室、食堂、小学校、幼儿园等等，房子都粉刷得雪白，墙上还画着些动人的彩色壁画。在村子当中，屋顶最高、门前挂着“光荣军属”牌子的那座房子，就是申纪兰的家。李顺达呢？他住在村子南头半坡上的一串带窑洞的院子里。地方倒很好认，就是人不容易找。除了外出开会，两位劳动模范一回村就想法挤时间上地生产，登门探望他们十有八、九是要扑空的。
    我这是第二次来西沟，好像也摸到一点规律似的，没有进屋，就一直往地里奔。果然，李顺达正带领着一伙社员，在靠近水库跟前的小片河滩地里突击种白菜。他们一边劳动、一边说说笑笑，丝毫也不显得累。这时候，在地头上的一位中年妇女提高嗓门叫道：“快，‘紧抓’，快把菜秧递过来！”逗得大家都乐开了，原来“紧抓”是人们最近给李顺达起的外号。事情经过是这样的：眼看玉茭、小米等大秋作物已经种得差不离了，劳动模范便提议除留下少数精壮劳力突击收尾外，其余的人手赶快转过来，利用零星闲地多种蔬菜和其他早熟作物。起初有的人思想不通，他就耐心地说服动员，自己还抓紧时机领头栽种，很快就把局面打开了，而且还影响到别的一些管理区和生产队。
    李顺达“紧抓”的结果，西沟村今年播种计划提前完成了，播种面积也扩大了。我到的第二天，刚种完白菜，劳动模范又把注意力转向山庄窝铺等偏僻的地方。我们相跟着到一条山沟里去，这条山沟在村子西边，是名副其实的西沟，李顺达小时候从河南林县逃荒上来，就是在这里安家落户的。从外面看，西沟并不大，但是越往里越开阔。大概走这么四里路的光景，突然出现了一个岔口，山沟在这里分成左右两道，一直伸到后面的大山里去。这地名叫“三岔口”，住着七、八户人家。李顺达过去就在这里租种地主的地，五亩地分成十一小片，每年打的粮食除给地主交租子，就剩不下多少了。检查罢工作，劳动模范一边走着、一边向我叙述西沟发展的历史。末了，他站在一棵梨树跟前，轻轻地抚摸着树身，无限深情地说：“这是我们栽的第一棵富根！”可不是吗，这正是李顺达按照党和毛主席所指引的组织起来的方向开步走时、在成立互助组那年接种的梨树。这棵树就在他过去住的房子背后。附近，还有好些大小不一的梨树、桃树和杏树，也都是李顺达在互助组、初级社和高级社时期亲手培植起来的，现在已经开花结果了。可以看得出劳动模范对这些果木怀着多么深厚的感情，他一棵挨着一棵地抚摸着，数说它们的年岁。我们在那里留连了好久，然后爬上旁边一座小山岗，了望远方，但见前后左右的高山上长着无数低矮的松、柏树，在向阳的半坡上却长着密密麻麻的年幼的苹果树和山桃、山杏树。这时候，劳动模范情不自禁地打开了话匣子，他说：“我们农民就像站在这三岔口上，有两条路好走：一条好比钻死山沟，少数人发财致富、多数人受灾受难的资本主义绝路；一条好比朝沟外走，组织起来、共同富裕的社会主义的光明大道。幸亏有党、有毛主席的领导，我们的路是越走越宽了。”十几年间，西沟村的光山秃岭逐渐变成了森林花果山。这时候，从远处传来几声轰响，劳动模范笑着说：“这是我们人民公社办的工业，正在开铁矿哩。”
    晚间，我们又返回到西沟村子里，恰巧那部带钢磨的小发电机修好了，公社社员们家里和街上的电灯齐放光明，晚饭时间虽然已经过去了，食堂里却聚着一些人在欢乐地谈笑着。
    第二天清早，我离开了西沟到龙镇去。公社正在那里召开社员代表会议，研究生产指标和各管理区之间的协作工程，补充选举公社干部。这天，除了申纪兰上北京开会外，李顺达和公社其他领导干部都在。中共西沟金星人民公社党委书记张满有在作总结时说：“过去我们这山沟是个穷地方，自从公社化以后，不仅不穷了，而且我们还有了二十个农具修配厂、七个面粉加工厂、五个耐火砖厂、两个采矿场、两个医院、一个兽医站、一个配种站……。这些就像刚出土发芽的庄稼一样，一天天地往上长。听说帝国主义天天骂我们公社，就让它去骂吧。我们的人民公社，是敲也敲不碎、打也打不烂的。”
