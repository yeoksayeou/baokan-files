The food at the construction site is even better, with hot meals and fragrant dishes, often accompanied by chili peppers that the migrant workers love.

    食堂服务人员
    关心民工如亲人
    湖南湘潭县花石水库石坝营的食堂，是工地的红旗食堂。这个食堂的十个服务人员在党支部的领导下，关心民工像自己的亲人一样。他们每天在民工起床以前就准备好了洗脸水，收工回来又有热水洗脚，每天几次送热茶到工地上去。工地伙食办得更好，饭热菜香，还经常配上民工爱吃的辣椒。
    食堂还设有卫生员，他们对民工更是体贴入微，每天到工地巡回检查，晚上还到宿舍替民工盖被子。
    工地生活搞的好，民工热情高、干劲大，工效不断提高。因此，这个食堂已连续两次被评为工地的红旗食堂。
