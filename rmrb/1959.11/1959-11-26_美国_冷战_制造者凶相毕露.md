U.S. "Cold War" Fabricators Reveal Their Ferocious Features
By Our Staff Commentator

    Under the instigation and manipulation of the United States, the General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly passed an illegal resolution on the 23rd, deciding to include the so-called "Hungarian Question" on the agenda of the General Assembly for discussion. This is another gust of "Cold War" wind stirred up by the United States in the United Nations after the so-called "Tibetan Question." The representative of the government of the Hungarian People's Republic has protested against this illegal resolution of the General Committee of the United Nations. The Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and just public opinion around the world have also exposed and strongly condemned this despicable action by the United States to intensify the "Cold War."
    The so-called "Hungarian Question" was originally a notorious "Cold War" commodity manufactured by the United States. Three years ago, the United States instigated Hungarian counter-revolutionary elements to carry out counter-revolutionary armed riots in Hungary, attempting to overthrow the socialist system of Hungary and restore imperialist enslavement and capitalist rule. However, the heroic Hungarian people, with the internationalist support of the Soviet army, brought the American conspiracy to a disgraceful failure. However, the United States was not reconciled to its failure, and in November 1956, it created the so-called "Hungarian Question" in the United Nations General Assembly, attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of the Hungarian people and continue to incite the remaining counter-revolutionary elements inside and outside Hungary to carry out subversive and sabotage activities against the Hungarian people's regime. But this kind of action by the United States cannot stop the victorious advance of Hungary's socialist cause. In recent years, Hungary's socialist system has become increasingly consolidated, and its socialist economy has become increasingly prosperous.
    Now, the United States has once again raised the so-called "Hungarian Question" in the United Nations. The U.S. Representative to the United Nations General Assembly, Lodge, has carried out vicious slanders and attacks against Hungary and the Soviet Union, and made extremely absurd distortions of the current situation in Hungary. This despicable behavior of the United States cannot in the slightest damage the lofty prestige of the socialist country of Hungary, but can only prove once again that U.S. imperialism is the ferocious enemy of the socialist cause, and tell the people of the world once again how the United States is sparing no effort to try to prevent the easing of international tensions.
    Recently, some leaders in the United States have repeatedly expressed verbally their willingness for peace and to ease international tensions, but at the same time, the United States not only advocates but actually accelerates the expansion of armaments, strengthens military blocs, and expands missile bases, and repeatedly uses the United Nations General Assembly to incite the "Cold War." When this shameful plot of the United States was met with stern exposure and accusations by the representatives of the Soviet Union and other countries in the United Nations General Assembly, the U.S. representative Lodge also tried his best to defend himself, saying that the United States' forcing the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the so-called "Hungarian Question" was not contradictory to the United States' professed intention to improve the international situation. Is crude interference in Hungary's internal affairs, malicious slander against the Soviet Union, and blatant violation of the United Nations Charter helpful to the easing of the international situation? These actions of the United States further prove how hypocritical the "peace" trick played by the United States is, and also prove more that the peace-loving people of the world must never be fooled by the U.S. "peace" fraud, but must heighten their vigilance, thoroughly expose and smash the American conspiracy, and carry the struggle for peace to the end.

    美国“冷战”制造者凶相毕露
    本报评论员
    在美国的策动和操纵下，联合国大会总务委员会在23日通过了一项非法决议，决定把所谓“匈牙利问题”列入大会议程，进行讨论。这是继所谓“西藏问题”以后，美国在联合国里煽起的又一次加剧“冷战”的阴风。匈牙利人民共和国政府代表已对联合国总务委员会的这个非法决议提出抗议。苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和世界各国的公正舆论也纷纷揭露和严词谴责了美国这种加剧“冷战”的卑劣行动。
    所谓“匈牙利问题”，本来就是美国制造的一个恶名昭彰的“冷战”货色。三年以前，美国曾经策动匈牙利反革命分子在匈牙利进行反革命武装暴乱，企图推翻匈牙利的社会主义制度，恢复帝国主义奴役与资本主义统治。但是，英勇的匈牙利人民在苏联军队的国际主义的支援下使美国的阴谋最后遭到了可耻的失败。然而，美国并不甘心于自己的失败，曾在1956年11月间在联合国大会中制造所谓“匈牙利问题”，企图借此干涉匈牙利人民的内政，继续煽动匈牙利国内外的残余反革命分子对匈牙利人民政权进行颠覆破坏活动。但是美国这种行动并不能阻止匈牙利社会主义事业的胜利前进。几年来，匈牙利的社会主义制度越来越巩固，社会主义经济越来越繁荣。
    现在，美国又一次在联合国提出所谓“匈牙利问题”，美国出席联合国大会代表洛奇对匈牙利和苏联进行了恶毒的诬蔑和攻击，把匈牙利的现状作了极端荒谬的歪曲。美国的这种卑劣行为，丝毫不能损害社会主义国家匈牙利的崇高威信，而只能再一次证明，美帝国主义是社会主义事业的凶恶的敌人，并且再一次告诉全世界人民，美国是怎样不遗余力地企图阻止国际紧张局势的缓和。
    最近以来，美国的一些领导人一再在口头上表示愿意和平、愿意缓和国际紧张局势，但是，与此同时，美国不但鼓吹而且在实际上加紧扩张军备、加强军事集团和扩充导弹基地，并且一再利用联合国大会来煽动“冷战”。当美国的这种可耻的图谋在联合国大会上遭到了苏联和其他国家代表的严词揭露和指责以后，美国代表洛奇还百般辩解，说什么美国强使联合国大会讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”，同美国所标榜的改善国际局势的说法并无矛盾。难道对匈牙利内政的粗暴干涉、对苏联的恶毒诽谤、对联合国宪章的公然违背，是能够有助于国际局势的缓和的吗？美国的这些行径，更加证明了美国所玩弄的“和平”把戏是多么虚伪，也更加证明了全世界爱好和平人民绝不能上美国“和平”骗局的当，而必须提高警惕，彻底揭穿和粉碎美国的阴谋，把为和平的斗争进行到底。
