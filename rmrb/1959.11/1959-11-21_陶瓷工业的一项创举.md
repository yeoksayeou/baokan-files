    A Creative Initiative in the Ceramics Industry
    The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, have liberated so many people's minds and created so many miracles! The success of using gas to fire down-draft kilns and semi-gas to fire up-draft round kilns in Zibo once again irrefutably proves the victory of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward.
    The successful experiment with gas-fired down-draft kilns is a major event in the ceramics industry. Someone once calculated: if all down-draft kilns and up-draft round kilns in our country are gasified, we can save more than 866,000 tons of coal annually from the coal alone; and this coal can be used to fire more than 1.1 billion pieces of daily-use ceramics. The increase in output due to the shortening of firing time is also considerable. For example, if the firing time is reduced by 40% after down-draft kilns are converted to gas, and up-draft round kilns are reduced by 30%, the increase in output can approach the total output of daily-use ceramics in Hebei and Jiangsu provinces this year. It can be seen how significant a major technological reform is.
    The gestation and growth of any new thing cannot be smooth sailing and without encountering difficulties; however, people often have various attitudes towards the difficulties in the growth process of new things. One is the lack of firm confidence in the experimental work. Seeing a little accident in the experiment, they waver in their determination to experiment and retreat. According to these people's logic, the experiment must be successful in one try, and if it is not successful, then give up. It is not difficult to imagine that people with this attitude will not be able to successfully experiment with anything. Another attitude is: experiment to the end, first make an objective analysis of the difficulties, find the laws of objective things, and then, after careful organization, march forward to the difficulties with head high, and finally overcome them! This is the only correct attitude towards difficulties. "Difficulty is like a spring, you are strong and it is weak, you are weak and it is strong," the practice of the workers in the Zibo ceramics industry confirms this truth.
    The ceramics industry is not only closely related to people's lives, but also occupies an increasingly important position in industrial and agricultural production. China's ceramics industry has a long history and enjoys a high reputation internationally. However, judging from the national production situation, many enterprises still use backward tools that have been used for hundreds or even thousands of years, and the operating procedures have not yet been thoroughly transformed. It is hoped that the vast number of workers on the ceramics industry front will continue to implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, widely and deeply carry out the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, and push the level of China's ceramics industry to a higher new stage.

    陶瓷工业的一项创举
    总路线，大跃进，解放了多少人的思想，又创造了多少个奇迹：淄博用煤气烧倒焰窑和半煤气烧直焰元窑的成功，又一次无可争辩地证明了总路线、大跃进的胜利。
    煤气烧倒焰窑的试验获得成功是陶瓷工业上的一件大事。曾经有人算过这样一笔账：我国目前的所有倒焰窑和直焰元窑都实现煤气化，仅煤炭一项每年就可节约八十六万六千多吨；而这些煤炭可以烧成十一亿多件日用陶瓷。因烧成时间缩短而增加的产量也相当可观。如以倒焰窑改用煤气后烧成时间缩短40％，直焰元窑缩短30％计算，增加的产量能接近河北、江苏两个省今年日用陶瓷的总产量。可见一项重大技术改革具有多么大的意义。
    任何新生的事物的孕育、成长，都不可能是一帆风顺，不遭遇什么困难的；然而，人们往往对待新生事物成长过程中的困难却有各种不同的态度。一种是对试验工作缺乏坚定的信心，看到在试验中出了一点事故，就动摇试验的决心，打了退堂鼓。按照这些人的逻辑是一试即成，不成就罢休。不难想像，抱有这种态度的人，是任何东西也试验不成功的。另一种态度是：试验到底，对困难首先作客观的分析，寻找客观事物的规律，然后再经过周密组织，昂首阔步地向困难进军，并最终战胜它！这是对待困难的唯一正确的态度。“困难像弹簧，你强它就弱，你弱它就强”，淄博陶瓷业职工们的实践证实了这个真理。
    陶瓷工业不仅与人民生活密切相关，在工农业生产上也占有越来越重要的位置。我国陶瓷工业有悠久的历史，在国际上素负盛誉。但从全国生产情况来看，有不少企业沿用了几百年、甚至千余年的落后工具，操作程序还没有能够得到彻底改造。希望陶瓷工业战线上的广大职工继续贯彻党的八届八中全会的精神，广泛深入地开展技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，把我国陶瓷工业水平推向更高的新阶段。
