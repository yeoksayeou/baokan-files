Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 22nd: After resisting the severe drought unseen in nearly seventy years with unparalleled heroic spirit, the people of Hubei Province, under the leadership of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, have launched a large-scale production for self-relief and thrifty living through the famine movement on the basis of the victory in the fight against drought, creating conditions for continued leap forward in 1960.

Since the end of June this year, most areas of Hubei Province have generally suffered from drought. Until the beginning of November, except for the Enshi, Yichang, and Xiangyang districts and parts of the Jingzhou district, which had a thorough rain in late September, most areas were under the grip of drought. The drought lasted for more than 120 days. Out of more than 6.4 million mu of cultivated land in the province, excluding the original more than 6 million mu of self-flowing irrigated paddy fields and the more than 4 million mu of self-flowing irrigated area expanded in the fight against drought, the drought-affected area was about 54 million mu.

The severity of this year's drought in Hubei is unprecedented in the past seventy years. According to data from the Hankou Central Meteorological Observatory, in the seventy-two years from 1887 to 1958, major droughts occurred in July, August, and September only in 1898, 1904, 1914, 1925, 1930, 1934, and 1958. Among these seven years, the drought generally lasted only about 30 days, and the severe drought in 1898 lasted only more than 50 days. The severe drought in 1958 lasted more than 80 days, but only in local areas of eastern and southern Hubei. In these drought-affected years, there was generally some rain during the drought period. In the most severe year, 1898, the rainfall in July was the least, but there was still 37.7 mm of rainfall that month. This year, the whole province was basically without rain in July and August and before September 20, and some places still had basically no rain until the end of October. Many ponds and reservoirs dried up, and many rivers stopped flowing. Even the famous Han River, during this year's flood season, had a significantly lower water level.

Under the leadership of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the people of Hubei Province launched a heroic struggle against the drought demon. When the signs of drought first appeared, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately issued emergency instructions, convened various meetings, and called on the vast number of cadres and masses in the province to mobilize urgently and resolutely fight the drought to the end. Party committees at all levels immediately established drought prevention and drought relief headquarters to lead this struggle. At the same time, from the secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and the heads of various departments of the Provincial Party Committee to the main responsible cadres at the prefecture, county, and commune levels, all went to the front line of drought relief to deeply lead the drought relief movement. More than 140,000 cadres throughout the province went deep into the fields and worked alongside the masses to fight the drought, immediately helping to solve problems. Driven by the cadres, the broad masses were in high spirits, and about 10 million people throughout the province were involved in this struggle. By mid-August, the first stage of the drought relief struggle, with the focus on protecting mid-season rice, was basically over. This stage of the drought relief struggle achieved great victory. Of the 14 million mu of mid-season rice in the province, more than 11 million mu were harvested or guaranteed a harvest, and more than 3 million mu of second-season late rice were rush-planted, and a large number of late autumn crops were rush-sown.

After mid-August, the drought relief struggle in the province entered the second stage, with the focus on protecting late rice. At this time, the drought was even more severe, and water sources became increasingly difficult. 82% of the province's more than 14 million small and medium-sized ponds and reservoirs had dried up, and most of the smaller rivers had also stopped flowing, making the struggle increasingly difficult. In this situation, some cadres developed a feeling of fear of difficulty and pessimism. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and party committees at all levels immediately criticized the feelings of fear of difficulty, relaxation, and right-leaning conservative thinking of a small number of cadres in accordance with the spirit of "anti-Rightist, boosting morale" put forward by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, adding new strength to the broad masses' determination to fight the drought to the end, and a greater and higher drought relief upsurge quickly formed. The drought relief struggle deepened further. The characteristic of the struggle in this period was to seek water from large rivers, large rivers, and lakes. Thousands of troops of labor turned to the Yangtze River and the Han River to divert the water of the rivers to irrigate the drought-stricken fields. In Huanggang Prefecture alone, there were more than 150 places to move the water of the Yangtze River and more than 2,000 places to move the water of large and small lakes. The achievements of the second stage of the drought relief struggle were also great. Of the 5.08 million mu of single-season late rice in the province, even under such severe drought conditions, 2.5 million mu were still harvested, guaranteed a harvest, or basically guaranteed a harvest; the 3.12 million mu of second-season late rice were under the threat of severe drought from transplanting to maturity, but about 2 million mu were still guaranteed a harvest.

In this drought relief struggle, the people's commune played its huge superiority of large organizational scale, wide range of activities, and ease of overall planning. Many communes mobilized hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of people at a time to divert river water and lake water over several mountains to irrigate drought-stricken fields. The Secretary of the Yangou Commune Party Committee in Gong'an County led 41 survey teams to find water sources everywhere, organized more than 2,300 people and 350 waterwheels to bring lake water from a mile away over the mountains to the fields. Many areas also rushed to build water conservancy projects to actively expand the irrigation area. The benefited area of water conservancy projects built and expanded in the province during the drought is equivalent to the total of water conservancy projects built last winter and this spring. According to statistics, a total of 190,000 channels were built and expanded during the drought, more than 200,000 wells, sand ponds, and spring eyes were dug, and more than 96,000 river dams were built, expanding the irrigation area by nearly 20 million mu. In addition, relying on the cooperation of urban workers and the industry run by the commune, the power of water lifting machinery increased by more than 56,300 horsepower.

Under the strong leadership of the Party, the people of Hubei Province overcame the great drought unseen in seventy years and achieved a great victory. However, due to the severity of the drought and the vastness of the drought-affected areas, the losses were still very serious. According to preliminary statistics, the harvest of major autumn crops most severely affected by drought in the province this year is as follows: of the more than 54 million mu affected by drought, 25 million mu were reduced in production due to the disaster (of which, calculated by replanting area, 15 million mu had basically no harvest), and the remaining nearly 30 million mu all had a bumper harvest.

The great victory of this year's drought relief struggle in Hubei Province fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist social system. Before liberation, the six major droughts from 1898 to 1934 were all much lighter than this year, but the disasters were much more serious. Each time, a large number of people fled the famine, and people's lives were miserable. In 1934, 45 counties were affected by drought, and the drought lasted less than two months, but at that time, according to the pseudo-Wuhan Daily, the drought-affected areas "rice seedlings were generally scorched, and many places had no harvest at all." According to the disaster situation in Hanyang County published in the 53rd public announcement of the pseudo-Hubei Provincial Government this year, the autumn harvest in the county was less than 30%, the loss of rice was 98.2 million kilograms, and the number of disaster victims in the county reached more than 114,100. This year, under the unprecedented severe drought, Hanyang County achieved a bumper harvest of grain, an increase of 13.6% over last year, and for the first time became a grain self-sufficient county, with no disaster victims and no starvation deaths in the county.

In order to make up for the serious losses caused by the drought, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China led the people of the province to carry out a large-scale over-planning and guarantee-planning movement and a production self-relief and thrifty living through the famine movement as early as September, calling on the people's communes to learn to live frugally and strive to avoid famine in famine years. According to statistics, the various vegetables that have been planted in various parts of the province are nearly 7 million mu, and it is estimated that 10 billion to 12 billion kilograms of vegetables can be produced, and a part has already been harvested; at the same time, various places have generally grasped diversified management. In the first month and a half of the fourth quarter, the income from diversified management of people's communes throughout the province has reached more than 240 million yuan. Now, the people in various places are continuing to advance victoriously and fighting to strive not to reduce income in the year of major disaster. At the same time, inspired by the victory in the drought relief struggle, the broad masses of the people in the province are heroically struggling for the continued leap forward of agricultural production in 1960, and a winter production upsurge centered on water conservancy has already formed. According to the plan, more than 1.27 million large, medium, and small water conservancy projects will be built, expanded, and continued to be built in the province this winter and next spring, and more than 3.6 million water conservancy troops have already gone to various construction sites. The heroic people of Hubei Province are determined to strive to basically eliminate water and drought disasters in the next few years.

    抗御了七十年来罕见的严重旱灾后
    湖北转入生产自救节约度荒
    大部地区干旱一百二十多天，受旱面积五千多万亩，其中因灾减产二千五百万亩，近三千万亩全部丰收。
    新华社武汉22日电　湖北省广大人民在中共湖北省委的领导下，以无比的英雄气概，战胜了近七十多年来罕见的严重旱灾，并在抗旱斗争胜利的基础上，展开了一个大规模的生产自救节约度荒运动，为1960年继续跃进创造条件。
    自从今年6月底以来，湖北省广大地区就普遍受旱，直到11月初，除恩施、宜昌、襄阳三个专区和荆州专区的部分地区曾在9月下旬下过一场透雨外，大部地区都在干旱笼罩之下，受旱时间长达一百二十多天，全省六千四百多万亩耕地中，除原有六百多万亩自流灌溉的水田和在抗旱斗争中扩大的四百多万亩自流灌溉面积外，受旱面积约有五千四百多万亩。
    今年湖北干旱严重情况为七十多年来所未有。据汉口中心气象台资料，湖北省从1887年到1958年的七十二年中，在7、8、9三个月发生大旱的只有1898、1904、1914、1925、1930、1934和1958这七年。在这七年当中，一般只旱了三十天左右，旱情严重的1898年也只旱了五十多天；1958年大旱八十多天，但只是鄂东和鄂南局部地区。而在这些受旱的年份里，受旱期中一般还下过一些雨，最严重的1898年以7月份雨量最少，但这个月仍降雨三十七点七毫米。今年全省7、8两月和9月20日以前基本无雨，有的地方直到10月底仍基本没有下雨。许多塘堰干涸，不少河流断流，连著名的汉水，在今年汛期，水位都大大下降。
    湖北省广大人民在中共湖北省委领导下向旱魔展开了英勇的斗争，当旱象刚露头的时候，中共湖北省委立即发出了紧急指示，召开各种会议，号召全省广大干部和群众，紧急动员起来，坚决抗旱抗到底。各级党委立即成立防旱、抗旱指挥部，领导这一斗争。同时，从省委书记、省委各部部长到地、县、公社各级主要负责干部，都立即分赴抗旱前线，深入领导抗旱运动。全省有十四万多名干部深入田间和群众一道抗旱，发现问题立即帮助解决。在干部带动下，广大群众斗志昂扬，意气风发，全省投入这一斗争的共达一千万人左右。到8月中旬，以保中稻为中心的抗旱斗争第一阶段基本结束，这一阶段的抗旱斗争取得很大的胜利。全省一千四百万亩中稻，丰收、保收的有一千一百多万亩，还抗旱抢插了三百多万亩二季晚稻和抢种了大量晚秋作物。
    8月中旬以后，全省抗旱斗争进入了以保晚稻为中心的第二阶段。这时旱情更加严重，水源越来越困难，全省一千四百多万处中小型塘堰，干涸的已达82％，多数较小的河流也已断流，斗争越来越艰苦。在这种情况下，有一部分干部产生了畏难、悲观情绪。中共湖北省委和各级党委马上根据党的八届八中全会提出的“反右倾、鼓干劲”的精神，批判了少数干部的畏难松劲情绪和右倾保守思想，给广大群众抗旱到底增添了新的力量，一个更大更高的抗旱高潮迅速形成。抗旱斗争进一步深入。这个时期斗争的特点是向大河、大江、湖泊要水。成千上万的劳动大军转战长江、汉水两岸，把江河的水引来灌田。仅黄冈专区搬长江的水就有一百五十多处，搬大小湖泊的水有二千多处。第二阶段的抗旱斗争，取得的成绩也是很大的。全省五百零八万亩一季晚稻在那样严重干旱情况下丰收、保收和基本保收的仍有二百五十万亩；三百一十二万亩二季晚稻从插秧到成熟一直处在大旱威胁下，但保收的仍有二百万亩左右。
    在这场抗旱斗争中，人民公社发挥了它的组织规模大、活动范围广和便于统筹全局的巨大优越性。许多公社一出动就是几百人、几千人甚至上万人，把江水、湖水引过几重山，灌溉受旱田地。公安县烟沟公社党委书记率领四十一个勘察小组遍找水源，组织两千三百多人三百五十多部水车，把一里路以外的湖水翻山越岭，送到田里。许多地区还突击兴修水利工程，积极扩大灌溉面积。全省在抗旱中修建和扩建的水利工程，受益面积相当于去冬今春所修建的水利工程的总和。据统计，在抗旱中修建和扩建的渠道共有十九万条，打井、掏沙塘和泉眼二十多万处、筑拦河坝九万六千多处，共扩大灌溉面积约近两千万亩。此外，依靠城市工人的协作和公社办的工业，提水机械增加了五万六千三百多匹马力。
    在党的坚强领导下，湖北省人民战胜了七十年来未有的大旱，获得了巨大胜利。但由于旱情严重、受旱地区广阔，因此，损失仍很严重。据初步统计，今年全省受旱最严重的大秋作物收获情况如下：受旱的五千四百多万亩中，因灾减产的有二千五百万亩（其中，按复种面积计算，基本无收的有一千五百万亩），其余的近三千万亩全部丰收。
    今年湖北省抗旱斗争的巨大胜利，充分显示了社会主义社会制度的无比优越性。解放前，1898年到1934年的六次大旱，每次干旱情况都比今年轻得多，但灾情却严重得多，每次都有大批群众逃荒，人民生活痛苦不堪。1934年有四十五个县受旱，受旱时间不到两个月，但那时据伪武汉日报形容，受旱地区“禾苗普遍焦枯，很多地方颗粒未收”。据这一年的伪湖北省政府第五十三号公报刊载的汉阳县受灾情况说：全县秋收不到三成，损失稻谷九千八百二十万公斤，全县灾民达十一万四千一百多人。而今年，汉阳县在空前未有的大旱情况下，全县粮食获得丰收，比去年增产13.6％，并且第一次成为粮食自给县，全县无一灾民，无一饿殍。
    为了弥补由于旱灾所造成的严重损失，中共湖北省委早在9月间，就领导全省人民开展了一个大规模超规划、保规划运动和生产自救、节约度荒运动，号召人民公社学会过日子，争取荒年不荒。据统计，全省各地已种的各种蔬菜近七百多万亩，估计可产菜一百亿斤到一百二十亿斤，现在已经收了一部分；同时，各地普遍大抓多种经营。第四季度的头一个半月中，全省各人民公社的多种经营收入已达二亿四千多万元。现在，各地人民正继续乘胜前进，为力争大灾年不减少收入而战。同时，全省广大人民在抗旱斗争的胜利鼓舞下，正在为1960年的农业生产继续跃进而英勇奋斗，一个以水利为中心的冬季生产高潮已经形成。据计划，全省今冬明春要修建、扩建、续建大中小水利工程一百二十七万多处，目前已有三百六十多万水利大军分赴各个工地。英雄的湖北省人民决心争取在今后几年内基本消灭水旱灾害。
