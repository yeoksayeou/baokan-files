    Xiangtan-Loudi Section of Xiangqian Railway Completed
    (Xinhua News Agency) The Xiangtan-Loudi section of the Xiangqian Railway has completed its track-laying project. The Xiangtan to Qiziqiao (20 kilometers from Loudi) section has been handling temporary passenger and freight transport since November 1st.
    This railway, 101 kilometers long, was built jointly by the Railway Corps of the People's Liberation Army and a large number of civilian workers. The railway passes through Xiangxiang and Lianyuan counties in Hunan Province, and will play a significant role in the economic and cultural construction of central Hunan. In the past, coal, iron ore, timber, and local specialties from central Hunan, which were used to support various regions, relied on transportation by trucks and wooden sailboats.
