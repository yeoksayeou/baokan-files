Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 26th: Public Security County, Hubei Province, has achieved great success in implementing "Five-Have" manure collection infrastructure, namely, large fields have fertilizer ponds, small fields have fertilizer mounds, pig raising has pens, cattle, horses, donkeys and mules have corrals, and roadsides and field edges have toilets.

By early October, Public Security County had basically achieved the "Five-Have" manure collection infrastructure, using these facilities to store large quantities of high-quality fertilizer, increasing the base fertilizer application per mu for over 500,000 mu of autumn-sown crops from 96 dan last year to 165 dan. On this basis, commune members further proposed to raise the "Five-Have" manure collection construction to a higher level. For example, Peng Pi-lin, a member of the Caozui Production Team of the Yuhu Commune, made three suggestions to the production team: First, line the original earthen pits with rammed earth to ensure they are covered from above and do not leak manure below; second, increase the number of mounds, ponds, corrals, pens, and toilets; third, build and utilize simultaneously, ensuring that ponds, mounds, and toilets are full.

The Public Security County Party Committee attached great importance to the suggestions from the masses, promptly summarized the experiences of various places in improving the "Five-Have" manure collection construction, combined water and soil management to vigorously grasp fertilizer construction planning, properly arranged labor, and relied on the masses to overcome material difficulties, launching a "Five-Have Construction Upgrade" campaign throughout the county. Since late October, in addition to further increasing the number and improving the quality of these manure collection facilities, there have also been changes in architectural forms and utilization methods. Most of these upgraded manure collection facilities have adopted a unified planning of water, soil, and fertilizer, and an integrated approach of collecting (fertilizer), transporting (fertilizer), and using (fertilizer). One approach is to combine land leveling and farmland water conservancy for self-flowing irrigation, constructing fertilizer mound and pond groups. Ten to dozens of fertilizer ponds and mounds are centrally arranged and built next to waterways and reservoirs, forming a line with water conservancy irrigation. One pond or mound manages one or several fields. When composting and topdressing, self-flowing irrigation can be used, combining the two production processes of topdressing and watering into one. This not only saves labor but also improves the quality of fertilization compared to manual fertilization. The county already has more than 3,700 such fertilizer pond groups. Another approach is a vine-like network of fertilizer ponds and mounds, which combines water and soil management with road construction planning, building a small fertilizer mound every 100 meters along the field roads and constructing a large fertilizer pond every 500 meters. In addition, there are forms such as pig farms at the field head, domestic fertilizer collection stations at the field head, and street garbage kilns.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, November 26th: People's communes in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have adopted methods such as combining year-round manure collection with concentrated campaigns, combining manure collection with fertilizer production, and combining collective manure collection with individual manure collection, resulting in rapid progress, large quantities, and good quality in manure collection and fertilizer production work.

After the establishment of year-round manure collection professional teams in various communes in Huinong County, a shed renovation and relocation campaign centered on manure collection was launched throughout the county. They moved the livestock pens closer to the fields, with each pen having fixed feeders and manure collectors responsible for livestock feeding management and manure collection and fertilizer production. Three composting pits were set up outside each pen. Pen manure was collected and started as it was produced, and the composted fertilizer was transferred to the compost yard next to the pit, sealed with mud to prevent the loss of fertilizer effectiveness, thus combining manure collection and fertilizer production and turning raw fertilizer into mature fertilizer. Now, the people's communes in various counties and cities in the Yellow River irrigation area are generally learning from the experience of Huinong County.

People's communes in various places are also vigorously producing indigenous chemical fertilizers. According to statistics, more than 2,000 indigenous chemical fertilizer plants have been established in people's communes throughout the region, producing more than 283 million jin of various indigenous chemical fertilizers.

While continuously collecting and producing fertilizer throughout the year, people's communes in various places are also organizing more manpower to concentrate on manure collection and green manure composting.

A hundred days of severe drought, celebrating a bumper harvest! However, how much hard work did it take to win the harvest on every mu of land and every inch of soil! Here is a record of the earth-shattering struggle against drought in Yingfeng Commune, Yiyang County.

    结合治水治土积肥造肥
    公安县积肥基建工作推向更高水平
    宁夏回族自治区一手抓农家肥一手抓土化肥
    据新华社武汉26日电　湖北公安县实行大片田有肥池、小片田有肥垱、养猪有圈、牛马驴骡有栏、路旁和田边有厕所的“五有”积肥基本建设，取得很大成绩。
    公安县在10月初就已经基本实现“五有”积肥基本建设，利用这些设施积贮了大批精肥，使全县五十多万亩秋种作物，每亩施底肥由去年的九十六担上升到一百六十五担。在这个基础上，社员们又提出要把这“五有”积肥建设提高到更高水平。如玉湖公社曹嘴生产队社员彭丕林，就向生产队提出三条建议：一是把原有土坑铺上三合土，做到上有天盖，下不漏粪；二是增加垱、池、栏、圈、厕所的数量；三是边建设边发挥作用，做到池满、垱满、厕所满。
    中共公安县委很重视来自群众的建议，立即总结各地提高“五有”积肥建设的经验，结合治水治土大抓肥料建设规划，妥善安排劳动力和依靠群众克服材料困难，在全县范围内开展了一个“五有建设升级”运动。从10月下旬以来，全县这些积肥设施除了数量进一步增加，质量更好以外，还在建筑形式和利用方式上有所变革。升级后的这些积肥设施，大多采取了水、土、肥统一规划，积（肥）、送（肥）、用（肥）综合的形式。一种是结合土地平整和农田水利自流灌溉，建设粪垱粪池群，把十个到几十个粪池粪垱集中排列建筑在流水口和蓄水坝库旁边，同水利灌溉形成一条线，一个池、垱管一块田或几块田，沤肥和追肥时，可以自流灌溉，使追肥和灌水两道生产程序合而为一，这样不但节省了劳力，施肥质量也比人工施肥好。全县已有三千七百多个这样的粪池群。再一种是瓜蔓式的粪池粪垱网，这就是结合治水治土修路规划，沿田间大道，每一百米建一个小粪垱，每五百米修一个大肥池。此外，还有田头养猪场、田头家肥收购站、街头垃圾窑等形式。
    据新华社银川26日电　宁夏回族自治区各人民公社采取常年积肥与突击积肥结合，积肥与造肥结合，集体积肥与个人积肥结合等办法，使积肥造肥工作进展快，数量多，质量好。
    惠农县各公社建立常年积肥专业队伍以后，在全县范围内展开了以积肥为中心的改棚迁圈工作。他们把畜圈移到靠近地头的地方，每个圈都设有固定的饲养员和积肥员，专门负责牲畜饲养管理和积肥造肥工作。在每个圈外设三个沤肥坑，圈粪随积随起，边起边沤，沤好的肥料移入坑旁堆肥场，用泥封闭，防止肥效流失，这样就把积肥和造肥结合起来，使生肥变为熟肥。现在，黄河灌溉区各县、市人民公社普遍学习惠农县的这个经验。
    各地人民公社同时大力制造土化肥。据统计，全区各人民公社已建立土化肥厂两千多个，已生产各种土化肥两亿八千三百多万斤。
    各地人民公社在常年积造肥料的同时，还组织更多人力突击积肥和沤压绿肥。
    百日大旱，喜庆丰收！然而，每一亩田、每一寸土上的作物赢得丰收，费去多少辛勤的劳动呵！这里记下了益阳县迎丰公社惊天动地的抗旱斗争。
