Comrades, friends! Esteemed guests!

Today we gather here in the new hall of the Soviet Embassy to celebrate the 42nd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution.

Please allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you here for your enthusiastic attention to the great festival of the peoples of the Soviet Union.

Forty-two years ago, a tremendous event shook the world—the victory of the October Socialist Revolution in Russia. The front of world imperialism was broken. Inspired by the vigorous ideas of Marxism-Leninism, and led by the Communist Party and the great teacher of the international proletariat, Lenin, the workers and peasants overthrew the rule of capitalists and landlords and established Soviet power. For the first time in world history, the oppressed laborers, who previously had no rights, obtained true human rights and freedoms and became masters of their own destiny.

Looking back at the glorious forty-two years of the Soviet people, we can proudly say that our heroic people have transformed their country into a powerful socialist nation and have achieved tremendous accomplishments praised by all progressive humanity.

We are equally encouraged that the Soviet Union has now entered a new historical stage of its development—the period of comprehensively unfolding communist construction. What the Soviet people are now considering and striving for is how to accelerate our progress. The Soviet people are greeting the anniversary of the October Revolution with great victories in all aspects of economic, political, and spiritual life.

The recently concluded session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union summarized the efforts made by our people in realizing the magnificent Seven-Year Plan and pointed out the inspiring and broad prospects for the development of the national economy and culture in 1960.

The soaring labor and political enthusiasm of all working people in our country, and the unity of the Soviet people around their Communist Party, its Central Committee, and the Soviet government, convincingly prove that the magnificent plan for building communism can not only be completed but can also be overfulfilled. The Soviet people are entering the forty-third anniversary of the October Revolution with full vigor and optimism, and with full confidence looking forward to their future, because their future shines with the never-extinguished light of the immortal doctrine of Marxism-Leninism.

Comrades, friends!

Never in human history has there been an event like the October Socialist Revolution that has had such a tremendous impact on the entire course of world development.

The October Revolution opened the way for the peoples of all countries to fight for freedom, peace, and socialism for the first time. Now the Soviet Union is no longer isolated, and an unbreakable world socialist system has been born.

All socialist countries are successfully building a new life. The unity of the socialist countries is stronger than ever, and no one can undermine this unity!

On the great day of the 42nd anniversary of the October Revolution, the Soviet people extend their best wishes to the fraternal peoples of the socialist countries.

The great victories of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp have significantly influenced the international situation, shifting it in a direction favorable to peace and socialism. We are celebrating the 42nd anniversary of the October Revolution in a situation where the prospects for consolidating world peace are becoming increasingly favorable.

Of course, the struggle for lasting peace will not be easy, but the people will never allow themselves to be deceived by those notorious advocates of the "Cold War." In its foreign policy, the Soviet Union firmly adheres to the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. The realistic path to peace is complete and thorough disarmament. In the current situation, this is the main issue for humanity. All governments, parties, all diplomats, all social organizations, and the people of all countries must work towards this. However, at the same time, it is necessary for the people of all countries not to relax their vigilance against the conspiracies of the reactionaries.

The endless, passionate, pioneering spirit and activities of Comrade Khrushchev, the great defender of peace and head of the Soviet government, are for us an example of the great spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, and an example of dedicating great effort, courage, and unwavering perseverance to the struggle for peace.

Dear comrades, friends!

We Soviets who are currently in the People's Republic of China are very happy to celebrate the glorious October Revolution with the close friends and brothers of our Soviet peoples—the Chinese people. Eternal, sacred, and unbreakable friendship unites the peoples of the Soviet Union and China, a friendship forged in the common struggle for the great common goal of socialism and communism. The People's Republic of China celebrated its tenth anniversary with brilliant achievements, and the Soviet people are also proud of these brilliant achievements along with their Chinese friends. Utilizing the superiority of development along the socialist road, the Communist Party of China and the government of the People's Republic of China have mobilized 650 million people to engage in heroic labor to overcome the heavy legacy left by the old semi-feudal and semi-colonial China—economic backwardness—and to transform their motherland into a powerful socialist country with a highly developed modern industry, large-scale mechanized agriculture, advanced science and culture, and a high standard of living for the people.

Dear friends, I assure you that the Soviet people will continue to do everything possible to develop and consolidate the fraternal friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China, and to further consolidate and prosper the friendship between the peoples of all countries in the world socialist system.

On this day of the great October Revolution, I sincerely congratulate the Chinese people on their new and greater achievements in socialist construction and in the struggle for world peace, and I propose a toast:

To the great Chinese people—the builders of socialism!

To the Communist Party of China and its Central Committee, and to the health of Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Communist Party of China!

To the health of Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China!

To the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China and the peoples of socialist countries!

To world peace!

    在庆祝十月革命四十二周年的招待会上
    契尔沃年科大使的讲话亲爱的同志们，朋友们！尊敬的来宾们！
    今天我们在这里，在苏联大使馆新建的大厅里聚会，来庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年。
    请允许我向全体在座的各位朋友表示衷心谢意，感谢你们对苏联各族人民伟大节日的热情关注。
    四十二年前，一个巨大的事件震撼了全世界——十月社会主义革命在俄国胜利了。世界帝国主义的阵线被打破了。为生气勃勃的马克思列宁主义思想所鼓舞的、由共产党和国际无产阶级的伟大导师列宁所领导的工人和农民推翻了资本家和地主的统治，建立了苏维埃政权。从前没有任何权利的受压迫的劳动者在世界历史上第一次获得了人的真正权利和自由，作了自己命运的主人。
    我们在回顾苏联人民走过的光荣的四十二年的路程时，可以自豪地说，我国英雄的人民已经把自己的国家变成了一个强大的社会主义国家，并取得了为全体进步人类赞扬的巨大成就。
    我们同样感到欢欣鼓舞的是，如今苏联已经进入自己发展的新的历史阶段——全面展开共产主义建设时期。现在苏联人所考虑的和努力争取的是如何加速我们的前进。苏联人正以经济、政治和精神生活各方面的巨大胜利迎接十月革命节。
    最近闭幕的苏联最高苏维埃会议对我国人民在实现宏伟的七年计划方面所作的努力进行了总结，并指出了1960年国民经济和文化发展的令人欢欣鼓舞的广阔远景。
    我国全体劳动人民的高涨的劳动和政治热情，苏联人民团结在自己的共产党、它的中央委员会和苏联政府的周围，令人信服地证明，建设共产主义的宏伟计划不仅能够完成而且能够超额完成。苏联人民正以充沛的精力和乐观地进入十月革命的四十三周年，并且信心百倍地瞻望自己的未来，因为他们的未来闪耀着马克思列宁主义不朽学说的永不熄灭的光辉。
    同志们，朋友们！
    人类历史上从未有过像十月社会主义革命这样给世界发展的整个进程以如此巨大的影响的事件。
    十月革命第一次为各国人民开辟了为自由、和平和社会主义而斗争的道路。现在苏联已不是孤立的了，牢不可破的世界社会主义体系已经诞生。
    所有社会主义国家都在顺利地建设着新生活。社会主义各国的团结一致比任何时候都更加牢固了，任何人也破坏不了这种团结一致！
    在十月革命四十二周年的伟大的日子里，苏联人民向社会主义各国的兄弟人民致以最良好的祝愿。
    苏联和社会主义阵营各国的伟大胜利，明显地影响了国际局势，向着有利于和平和社会主义的方向转变。我们是在这样的情况下来庆祝十月革命四十二周年的，即巩固全世界和平的前景变得越来越有利了。
    当然，争取持久和平的斗争将不是轻易的，但是，人民决不允许那些声名狼籍的“冷战”拥护者们欺骗他们。苏联在自己的外交政策方面，坚定地遵循着同不同社会制度各国和平共处的列宁主义原则。通向和平的现实道路是彻底全面裁军。在目前情况下这是人类的主要问题。所有的政府、党派、所有的外交家、所有的社会组织和各国人民都要为此努力。但是，同时要求各国人民不要放松对反动派阴谋的警惕性。
    伟大的和平捍卫者、苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫同志的无穷无尽的、热情澎湃的首创精神和活动，对我们来讲，是全心全意地为人民服务的伟大精神的榜样，是献出巨大的努力、勇敢和坚持不渝、不屈不挠地为和平而斗争的榜样。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    我们这些今天正在中华人民共和国的苏联人，很高兴能同我们苏联各族人民的亲密朋友和兄弟——中国各族人民一起庆祝光辉的十月革命节。永恒的、神圣的、牢不可破的友谊把苏中两国人民联结在一起，这种友谊是在为社会主义和共产主义的伟大的共同目标而共同奋斗中缔结的。中华人民共和国曾以辉煌的成就庆祝了建国十周年，苏联人也和中国朋友一起为这些辉煌的成就感到骄傲。中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府利用沿着社会主义道路发展的优越性，发动了六亿五千万人民从事英勇的劳动，以便克服半封建半殖民地的旧中国留下来的沉重的遗产——经济上的落后，并且把自己的祖国变成一个有高度发展的现代化工业，大规模的机械化农业，先进的科学文化、人民生活水平很高的强大的社会主义国家。
    亲爱的朋友们，我向你们保证，苏联人民今后也会尽一切可能来发展和巩固苏中两国人民间的兄弟般的友谊，并使世界社会主义体系各国人民之间的友谊进一步巩固和繁荣。
    在伟大的十月革命节的今天，我衷心地祝贺中国人民在社会主义建设中，在争取世界和平的斗争中取得新的更伟大的成就，我提议：
    为伟大的中国人民——社会主义的建设者干杯！
    为中国共产党及其中央委员会，为中国共产党主席毛泽东同志的健康干杯！
    为中华人民共和国主席刘少奇同志的健康干杯！
    为苏中两国人民和社会主义各国人民之间的永恒的、牢不可破的友谊干杯！
    为世界和平干杯！
