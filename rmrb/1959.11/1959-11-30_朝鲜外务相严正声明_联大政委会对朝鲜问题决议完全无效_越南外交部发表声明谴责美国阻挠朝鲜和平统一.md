Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 28th: North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Pak Sung Chul issued a statement today saying that the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea declares the illegal resolution on the Korean question once again adopted by the Political Committee of the current UN General Assembly on November 27th, in violation of the will and interests of the Korean people, to be entirely invalid, and resolutely rejects and condemns it. At the same time, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea once again strongly insists that the United Nations should strictly follow the spirit of the United Nations Charter and take measures to immediately withdraw the US aggressor troops obstructing the peaceful reunification of North Korea from South Korea, and dissolve the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea."

The declaration pointed out: "The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has clarified that it is illegal to include the Korean question, which should be resolved by the Korean people themselves, on the agenda of the current UN General Assembly and to discuss it at the UN. Once it is included on the agenda for discussion, representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea should participate. However, US imperialism ignored this legitimate demand, manipulated the countries following it in the UN Political Committee, refused the participation of the Republic's representatives, and unilaterally discussed the Korean question based on the absurd fabricated report of its tool of aggression, the ‘United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea,’ and passed the so-called fourteen-nation proposal, further lowering the prestige of the United Nations."

The declaration said, "The purpose of this 'resolution' passed according to the conspiracy of US imperialism, like a series of past resolutions on the Korean question, is to legitimize the US imperialist occupation of South Korea and to expand the fascist terror regime of Syngman Rhee to North Korea."

The declaration said that the United Nations, having been used by US imperialism as a cover for aggression against Korea and becoming a belligerent party in the Korean War, has long lost its moral authority to fairly resolve the Korean question. US imperialism is still continuing to occupy South Korea under the banner of the United Nations, obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea by every possible means, and plotting to artificially and permanently divide Korea.

The declaration emphasized, "The prerequisite for resolving the Korean question is: the immediate withdrawal of American aggressor troops from South Korea. Now, the US military has no excuse to stay in South Korea." The declaration pointed out, "The Korean question must be resolved peacefully by the Korean people themselves, on a democratic basis, by establishing a unified sovereign body through general elections, without any external interference."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 27th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today regarding the United Nations' discussion of the Korean question, pointing out that US imperialism, disregarding the opposition of Soviet representatives, colluded with some representatives in the UN Political Committee to pass a resolution to discuss the Korean question in the UN General Assembly without the presence of representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This behavior grossly violated the UN Charter, violated the interests of the Korean people, and damaged the prestige of the United Nations. This behavior is part of a conspiracy to continue occupying South Korea and permanently divide Korea under the guise of the United Nations, with the aim of plotting a new war in Korea and Asia.

The declaration said that the issue of Korean reunification has been delayed for fourteen years without resolution, and the deep desire of the Korean people for peaceful reunification of their homeland has not yet been realized. All this is due to the fact that in order to realize its aggression and war policies, US imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea, occupied South Korea, and turned South Korea into a US atomic war base, preparing to launch a new war in Asia.

The declaration said that the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believe that the issue of Korean reunification must be resolved by the Korean people themselves without any foreign interference. The Vietnamese people and government firmly support the position of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea demanding the withdrawal of US and other foreign troops from South Korea, allowing the Korean people to decide the fate of their homeland.

The declaration pointed out that in the current situation where the international situation is easing, US imperialism stubbornly refuses to withdraw the troops staying in South Korea, which will surely be condemned by the Korean and Vietnamese people, as well as peace-loving people around the world, and their vicious conspiracy will ultimately be defeated miserably.

    朝鲜外务相严正声明
    联大政委会对朝鲜问题决议完全无效
    越南外交部发表声明谴责美国阻挠朝鲜和平统一
    新华社平壤28日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴成哲今天发表声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府宣布本届联合国大会政治委员会27日违背朝鲜人民的意志和利益又一次通过的关于朝鲜问题的非法决议是完全无效的，并坚决地加以拒绝和谴责。同时，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府再一次强烈主张，联合国应当严格根据联合国宪章的精神，采取措施，使阻碍朝鲜的和平统一的美国侵略军立即从南朝鲜撤出，解散“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会”。
    声明指出，“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾阐明：把应当由朝鲜人民自己解决的朝鲜问题列入本届联大议程而在联大进行讨论是非法的，一旦列入议程进行讨论，就应当有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加。但是，美帝国主义无视这一正当主张，在联大政治委员会上操纵追随它的国家，拒绝共和国的代表参加，并根据它的侵略工具——‘联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会’的荒唐无稽的捏造的报告，片面地讨论了朝鲜问题，并通过了所谓十四国提案，使联合国的威信进一步降低。”
    声明说，“根据美帝国主义的阴谋通过的这个‘决议’，同过去关于朝鲜问题的一系列的决议一样，目的在于使美帝国主义强占南朝鲜合法化，并且使李承晚的法西斯恐怖统治制度扩张到朝鲜北部。”
    声明说，联合国由于被美帝国主义利用为侵略朝鲜的掩护体而成为朝鲜战争的交战一方，早已丧失了公正解决朝鲜问题的道义上的权威。美帝国主义至今还在联合国的招牌下，继续强占着南朝鲜，千方百计地阻挠着朝鲜的和平统一，并阴谋人为地永久分裂朝鲜。
    声明强调，“解决朝鲜问题的先决条件是：立即从南朝鲜撤走美国侵略军队。现在，美军没有任何借口留在南朝鲜了。”声明指出，“朝鲜问题必须在没有任何外力干涉的条件下，由朝鲜人民自己，在民主的基础上，以通过总选举建立统一的主权机关的方法来和平解决。”
    据新华社河内27日电　越南民主共和国外交部今天就联合国讨论朝鲜问题发表声明指出，美帝国主义无视苏联代表的反对，拉拢联合国政治委员会中的一些代表，在没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表出席会议的情况下，通过将在联合国大会讨论朝鲜问题的决议，这种行为粗暴地违反了联合国宪章，违反了朝鲜人民的利益，损害了联合国的威信。这种行为是盗用联合国的名义来继续占领南朝鲜、长期分割朝鲜的阴谋的一部分，其目的是阴谋在朝鲜和亚洲发动新战争。
    声明说，朝鲜的统一问题已经拖延了十四年而未能解决，朝鲜人民要求和平统一祖国的深切愿望至今未能实现。这一切都是由于美帝国主义为了实现它的侵略和战争政策，发动侵略朝鲜的战争，占领南朝鲜，把南朝鲜变成美国的原子战争基地，准备在亚洲发动新战争所造成的。
    声明说，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府认为，朝鲜的统一问题必须在没有任何外国干涉的基础上，由朝鲜人民自己解决。越南人民和政府坚决支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府关于要求美国和其他外国军队撤出南朝鲜，让朝鲜人民自己决定祖国的命运的主张。
    声明指出，在当前国际局势趋于缓和的情况下，美帝国主义仍然顽固地不肯把赖在南朝鲜的军队撤走，一定会遭到朝鲜人民和越南人民以及世界爱好和平人民的谴责，而且他们的恶毒阴谋最后一定要遭到惨败。
