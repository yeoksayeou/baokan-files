Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Cambodia submitted its seventh interim report on July 28, 1959, confirming the fact that South Vietnamese troops had launched a large-scale invasion of Stung Treng Province in Cambodia and occupied Cambodian territory to a depth of nearly two kilometers in June 1958. This report has been released today. The report covers the period from January 1, 1958, to December 31, 1958.

The report stated in its preamble: "The Commission's remaining responsibilities during this period are governed by Articles 6, 7, 13(c), and 21 of the Geneva Agreements on Cambodia." Article 6 pertains to the provisions against discrimination and retaliation against former Khmer Resistance personnel; Article 7 concerns provisions regarding Cambodia's non-participation in military alliances, etc.; Article 13(c) concerns the provision that the International Commission may monitor military personnel and war materials entering the country as foreign aid at all ports, airports, and all borders of Cambodia; and Article 21 concerns the issue of foreign armed forces violating the territorial integrity of Cambodia.

The report pointed out that in 1958, the Commission received three appeals related to the provisions of Article 6. After review, the Commission decided not to take action on two of them but raised the other appeal with the Royal Government of Cambodia. Furthermore, the Commission was still awaiting a response from the Royal Government regarding three unresolved cases from the end of 1957. The report expressed satisfaction with the implementation of Article 7 and stated that there was "nothing to report" regarding the implementation of Article 13(c).

The report focused on the problem of South Vietnam and Thailand constantly threatening and infringing upon Cambodian territorial sovereignty with force.

The report indicates that during the year, the Royal Government of Cambodia sent thirty letters to the Cambodian International Commission regarding major and minor incidents of South Vietnam and Thailand strengthening military forces and conducting armed invasions along the Cambodian border. In addition to forwarding relevant incidents to the Vietnam International Commission for its consideration and handling, the Cambodian International Commission also dispatched an investigation team to the scene of the larger Stung Treng incident (June 1958) to conduct an investigation. The investigation team's findings revealed that the South Vietnamese authorities had erected a new boundary marker 1,800 meters inside Cambodian territory and stationed South Vietnamese troops near this new boundary marker. The investigation team also determined that South Vietnamese troops had surrounded Ban Pa Nai village for approximately six to eight hours around June 18, 1958, and a plane may have flown over the village to provide support. Residents were prohibited from leaving the village during the encirclement.

The report also mentioned that in the Stung Treng incident, ninety former Vietnamese resistance personnel fled into Cambodia. According to the International Commission's team, these individuals were former Vietnamese resistance personnel or had some connection to the resistance movement. The report stated, "These refugees claimed to have been arrested between 1955 and 1956 and imprisoned without any trial. They said they were forced to do hard labor on an airfield construction site in Kouti, which is said to be in South Vietnamese territory near the border." Regarding these individuals, the Royal Government of Cambodia wrote to the International Commission on August 9, 1958, stating, "Some representatives of their comrades said that from 1945 to 1954, they belonged to the Viet Minh organization; after the signing of the Geneva Accords, they returned home and resumed their original occupations, such as farming or trading. In 1954, 1955, and 1956, the South Vietnamese authorities arrested them and sent them along with 445 other political prisoners to the Kouti detention camp. According to their account, they fled to Cambodia because the situation was too difficult. They voluntarily went to Bou Kieu to seek refuge with the Cambodian authorities and requested permission to go to North Vietnam." The Royal Government's letter also stated that it "decided to hand over these imprisoned individuals to the International Commission so that it could take the necessary actions in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Agreements."

The seventh interim report of the Cambodian International Commission clearly shows that the South Vietnamese authorities not only seriously violated the Geneva Agreements regarding the prohibition of persecution of former resistance personnel but also constantly threatened and infringed upon Cambodian territory with force, endangering the Cambodian people. These facts demonstrate the continued necessity of the Cambodian International Commission's existence and its monitoring and supervision of the implementation of the Geneva Agreements.

    柬埔寨国际委员会提出第七次临时报告
    证实南越军队曾大举侵入柬埔寨领土
    据新华社16日讯　柬埔寨国际监察和监督委员会在1959年7月28日提出了第七次临时报告，证实了南越军队曾于1958年6月间大举侵入柬埔寨上丁省和占据近两公里纵深的柬埔寨领土的事实。这份报告已于今天发表。报告涉及的期间是1958年1月1日到1958年12月31日。
    报告在前言中说：“委员会在此期间的剩余职责是由关于柬埔寨的日内瓦协定第六、七、十三（丙）和二十一条所规定的”。第六条是关于前高棉抗战部队人员不受歧视和报复的规定，第七条是关于柬埔寨不参加军事同盟等规定，第十三条丙款是关于国际委员会得在柬埔寨各口岸、飞机场和全部边境上，监察作为进入该国的外援的军事人员和作战物资的规定，第二十一条是关于外国武装力量破坏柬埔寨领土完整问题的规定。
    报告指出，在1958年一年中，委员会收到了三封涉及第六条规定的呼吁书，经委员会研究后，决定不对其中两封采取行动，但就另一封呼吁书向柬埔寨王国政府提出交涉。此外，委员会对于1957年年终时三个没有了结的案件，还在等待王国政府的答复。报告对第七条的执行感到满意，对第十三条丙款的执行则“无可报告”。
    报告着重地谈到了南越和泰国不断地以武力威胁和侵犯柬埔寨领土主权的问题。
    报告表明，柬埔寨王国政府在这一年中曾就南越和泰国在柬埔寨边境增强军事力量和进行武装侵犯的大小事件向柬埔寨国际委员会写了三十封信。柬埔寨国际委员会除将有关事件转告越南国际委员会请它研究处理外，还对其中较大的一次上丁事件（1958年6月）派出调查小组到现场进行调查。这个小组的调查结果表明，南越当局在柬埔寨境内，深入柬埔寨领土一千八百米处树立一个新界桩，并且在这个新界桩附近驻有南越军队。调查小组还查明南越军队曾在1958年6月18日左右包围了班巴乃村约六到八小时，并可能有一架飞机在村庄上空飞翔助威，在村庄被包围时，居民被禁止出来。
    报告还提到在上丁事件中，有九十名前越南抗战人员逃入柬埔寨。据国际委员会的小组查明，这些人是前越南抗战人员或同抗战运动有某些关系的人。报告说，“这些逃亡者自称是在1955年和1956年之间被捕，未经任何审判就被关进监狱的。他们说，他们被迫在古地的一个飞机场工地上作苦工，据说古地是在靠近边界的南越境内。”关于这些人员，柬埔寨王国政府曾于1958年8月9日写信给国际委员会说，“其中某几个代表他们的同志说，1945年到1954年，他们属于越盟组织；日内瓦协议签订以后，他们返回家园，恢复原先的职业，如种地或作买卖。1954年、1955年和1956年南越当局逮捕了他们，把他们同其他四百四十五名政治犯一同送往古地的拘留营。根据他们的说法，他们逃到柬埔寨来是因为情况太苦。他们自愿到布胶投奔柬埔寨当局，要求准予前去北越。”王国政府来信还说，它“决定将这些被监禁的人交给国际委员会，让它按照日内瓦协议的规定采取必要的行动。”
    柬埔寨国际委员会第七次临时报告清楚表明，南越当局不仅严重违反日内瓦协议关于不得迫害前抗战人员的规定，而且还不断以武力威胁和侵犯柬埔寨领土，危害柬埔寨人民。这些事实说明了柬埔寨国际委员会继续存在和对日内瓦协议的履行进行监察和监督的必要性。
