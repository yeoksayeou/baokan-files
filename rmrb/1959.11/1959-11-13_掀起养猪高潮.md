    Stirring Up a High Tide of Pig Farming

    Striving for one pig per mu of land is one of the central themes of agricultural propaganda in local newspapers recently.

    Many newspapers have published editorials elaborating on the great significance of developing pig farming. Zhejiang Daily's editorial said: Grain and animal husbandry are two inseparable and important sectors in the agricultural economy, and their relationship is interdependent and mutually reinforcing. The continuous leap forward in grain production is a prerequisite for the great development of animal husbandry; at the same time, only the great development of animal husbandry can fundamentally solve the grain problem. Guizhou Daily proposed to grasp animal husbandry as vigorously as grain, cotton, and oil. The editorial of Fujian Daily stated that rapidly developing pig farming and accumulating large amounts of pig manure are decisive measures to ensure a leap forward in grain production. Pig manure is a high-quality organic fertilizer, and even when a large amount of chemical fertilizer is available in the future, the significant role of pig farming and manure accumulation cannot be ignored.

    Concentration and prominence are the characteristics of local newspapers' propaganda on pig farming issues. Zhejiang Daily has repeatedly used bold headlines on the front page: "Go all out to raise pigs extensively, one pig per person, one pig per mu," "Raise fields with pigs, raise pigs with fields, more pigs, more fertilizer, more fertilizer, more grain," reporting advanced experiences of high-speed development of pig farming in various places. The newspaper has systematically introduced the pig-raising experience of the Xihu Commune and Xihu Production Team in Hangzhou, and also organized a pictorial of "On the Pastures of the Xihu People's Commune." Fujian Daily has been inserting "red flags" for pig farming and manure accumulation for several days. The newspaper's report on Changtai County, which averages four pigs per household, powerfully illustrates the benefits of pig farming: the county has accumulated nearly 1.87 million dan of pig manure this year, enabling more than 250,000 mu of rice fields to receive an average of more than seven dan of pig manure per mu, promoting a bumper harvest in agriculture; the county has transferred 10,500 live pigs, over fulfilling the task and supporting national construction; the income from pig farming accounts for 22% of the total agricultural income, and the income of the commune members is more than 420,000 yuan in cash. From January to September, each person ate an average of more than six jin of pork, initially improving their lives. Fujian Daily also introduced the pig-raising experience of four production brigades, such as the Huochetou Team of Shaxian County, which are located in mountainous, plain, and coastal areas, but have all achieved one pig per person. These typical reports powerfully broke the right-leaning conservative ideas on the issue of pig raising.

    Correctly implementing the policy of developing pig production is a problem that local newspapers attach great importance to. All newspapers have promoted the need to fully implement the policy of giving priority to collective breeding, with both public and private breeding being equally important. Yunnan Daily once published an editorial on this issue, pointing out that actively developing collective pig raising and advocating private pig raising by commune members is a complete policy and should not be understood one-sidedly.

    Local newspapers have also paid attention to solving some specific problems in the development of pig farming. For example, on the issue of pig sources, many newspapers promote the principle of self-breeding and self-raising, while introducing some effective practices. Xinhua Daily reported the experience of Dongtai County in establishing pig breeding farms by the county's commercial departments, communes, and production teams to form a pig breeding base network. Fujian Daily disseminated the experience of Yuxi Commune in establishing breeding pig farms and implementing the policy of "keeping all sows, selecting later, and full mating and pregnancy." Regarding the issue of feed, Guizhou Daily proposed to arrange feed like arranging rations, while widely collecting roughage. Zhejiang Daily reported the experience of Jiaxing and other places in vigorously developing green feed. Fujian Daily proposed to plan for the long term, establish fixed feed bases, and actively introducing Queen Golden Corn is a good way.

    Some newspapers introduced advanced methods of pig farming and manure accumulation: establishing field-side pig farms. Hubei Daily and Guangxi Daily have published reports in this regard. Guangxi Daily's news about the construction of field-side pig farms in Xincheng County illustrates that this can solve four contradictions, namely the contradiction between having more pigs, more fertilizer, and insufficient labor and transportation; the contradiction that livestock diseases are prone to occur when pig farms are located in villages; the contradiction between raising pigs, accumulating manure, and eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene; and the contradiction between uneven fertilization of distant and nearby fields and large differences in output.

### 掀起养猪高潮

    掀起养猪高潮
    为每亩地一头猪而奋斗，这是最近各地报纸农业宣传的中心题目之一。
    不少报纸发表了社论，阐述发展养猪业的重大意义。浙江日报的社论说：粮食和畜牧业是农业经济中两个不可分割的重要部门，它们的关系是相互依存和相互促进的。粮食生产不断跃进，是畜牧业大发展的先决条件；同时也只有畜牧业大发展，才能根本解决粮食问题。贵州日报提出要像抓粮、棉、油一样，大抓畜牧业。福建日报的社论说，迅速发展养猪事业，大量增积猪肥，是保证粮食生产跃进的一项决定性的措施。猪粪是一种优质的有机肥料，即使在将来有了大量化学肥料的情况下，养猪积肥的重大作用也是不可抹杀的。
    集中突出，是各地报纸宣传养猪问题的特点。浙江日报几次在一版作了通栏大标题：“鼓足干劲大养特养，每人一头猪每亩一头猪”，“以猪养田，以田养猪，猪多肥多，肥多粮多”，报道各地高速发展养猪事业的先进经验。对杭州市西湖公社和西湖生产队的养猪经验，报纸先后作了比较系统的介绍，还组织了“在西湖人民公社的牧场上”的画刊。福建日报连日来大插养猪积肥的“红旗”。报纸刊出的长泰县平均每户养猪四头的报道，用有力的事实说明了养猪的好处：这个县今年已积猪肥近一百八十七万担，使二十五万多亩稻田平均每亩增施猪肥七担多，促成了农业大丰收；全县已外调活猪一万零五百头，超额完成任务，支援了国家建设；养猪的收入占到农业总收入22％，社员收入现款四十二万多元，从1月到9月，平均每人吃到猪肉六斤以上，初步改善了生活。福建日报还介绍了位于山区、平原、沿海等不同地区，但同样实现了每人一猪的沙县火车头队等四个生产大队的养猪经验，这些典型报道，有力地击破了在养猪问题上的右倾保守思想。
    正确地执行发展养猪生产的方针，是各地报纸十分重视的问题。各报都宣传了必须全面执行以集体饲养为主、公养私养并重的方针。云南日报曾就这个问题专门发了社论，指出既积极发展集体养猪，又提倡社员私人养猪，是一个完整的方针，决不可以片面地理解。
    各地报纸也注意到发展养猪业中的一些具体问题的解决。例如猪源问题，许多报纸宣传了自繁自养的原则，同时介绍了一些行之有效的作法。新华日报报道了东台县由县商业部门、公社、生产队三方面建立生猪繁殖场、组成生猪繁殖基地网的经验。福建日报传播了渔溪公社建立种猪场、实行“见母就留，先留后选，全配全孕”的经验。又如饲料问题，贵州日报提出要像安排口粮一样安排好饲料，同时广泛地搜集粗饲料。浙江日报报道了嘉兴等地大搞青饲料的经验。福建日报提出要长远筹划，建立固定的饲料基地，而积极引种金皇后玉米是一个好办法。
    有些报纸介绍了先进的养猪积肥方法：建立田头猪场。湖北日报、广西日报都发表了这方面的报道。广西日报发表的忻城县大建田头猪场的消息，说明这样做可以解决四个矛盾，即养猪多、肥料多和劳力不足、运输跟不上的矛盾；猪场设在村里容易发生畜疫的矛盾；养猪积肥和除四害讲卫生的矛盾；远田近田上肥不均，产量悬殊的矛盾。
