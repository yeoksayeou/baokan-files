Xinhua News Agency, November 11th, Moscow dispatch: "Izvestia" published an article by Kudryavtsev stating that Asian and African countries have shown great interest in the economic, scientific, technological, and cultural achievements of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, which makes those in the US ruling bloc who refuse to abandon the "Cold War" policy very uneasy. Recently, they launched a propaganda campaign aimed at proving that the current fate of capitalism depends on what path Asian and African countries will develop along. Participating in this campaign are prominent American officials, such as Vice President Nixon and Under Secretary of State Dillon.
The article points out that Nixon's speech to students at the University of Los Angeles on November 6 is an example of this kind of propaganda. The main purpose of the speech is to plan the tasks of the United States in the new international situation from the perspective of maintaining the "Cold War." Nixon believes that the most important thing is not so much to help Asian and African countries develop their economies, but to make them allies of the United States against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.
The author of the article writes in this regard that some Americans often say that history has placed the burden of leading the "free (read: capitalist) world" on their country's shoulders. The author asks, but why do they not practice what they preach? For example, the Algerian people, who have shed blood for freedom and independence for many years, want to achieve freedom and independence, but why has the United States, as the leader of the "free world," not taken any measures for them? Why is this leader indifferent to the brutal suppression of the Congolese people fighting for independence by the Belgian colonial regime?
The author of the article asserts that this is because, like other capitalist countries, the United States has never historically provided bread or guaranteed freedom to economically backward people. What makes Nixon and his followers uneasy is not the fate of the freedom and independence of Asian and African countries, but the fate of the freedom of monopoly capitalists to control the wealth of these countries' people. Nixon defames socialist countries, especially socialist countries in Asia, because these countries have long been freed from unsolicited "guardians" and have gained freedom and independence.
This newspaper reported that, Los Angeles News: US Vice President Nixon delivered a speech to students at the University of Los Angeles on the 6th, using cliches to maintain the "Cold War," and tried his best to provoke relations between Asian and African countries and the Soviet Union and China.
Nixon stubbornly insisted that the Soviet Union and China are focusing their attention on people in the early stages of economic development. The people of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East are in a pivotal position in the struggle between "freedom" and "communism." Nixon hopes that they will not "lose their freedom (the so-called 'free world')" and said that the United States has a responsibility to "ensure" that they make a "choice."

### 苏联“消息报”发表文章揭露  尼克松竭力进行“冷战”宣传  挑拨亚非国家同中苏的关系

    苏联“消息报”发表文章揭露
    尼克松竭力进行“冷战”宣传  挑拨亚非国家同中苏的关系
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科11日讯：“消息报”刊载库德里亚夫采夫的一篇文章说，亚非国家对苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家在经济、科学技术和文化上所取得的成就表现了很高的兴趣，这使得美国统治集团中不放弃“冷战”政策的那一部分人物感到非常不安。最近，他们掀起了一个宣传运动，其目的在于证明：资本主义当前的命运取决于亚非国家将沿着什么样的道路发展。参加这个运动的有美国官方著名人士，如副总统尼克松和副国务卿狄龙之类的人物。
    文章指出，尼克松在本月6日对洛杉矶大学学生发表的演说就是这种宣传的例子。演说的主要目的是，仍然从维护“冷战”的观点出发来规划美国在新的国际局势中的任务。尼克松认为，最重要的事情与其说是帮助亚非国家发展经济，不如说是使亚非国家成为美国反对苏联和中华人民共和国的盟国。
    文章作者就这点写道，某些美国人士经常说，历史把领导“自由（请读成资本主义）世界”的担子放在他们国家的肩上。作者问道，但是为什么他们言行不一呢？例如，多年来为了争取自由和独立而流血的阿尔及利亚人民要想取得自由和独立，而作为“自由世界”领导者的美国为什么没有为他们采取任何措施呢？为什么这位领导者看到比利时殖民政权残酷镇压为独立而斗争的刚果人民而无动于衷呢？
    文章的作者断言，这是因为，像其它资本主义国家一样，美国在历史上还从未对经济落后的人民供应过面包，保障过自由。使尼克松等及其追随者感到不安的，不是亚非国家自由和独立的命运，而是垄断资本家支配这些国家人民的财富的自由的命运。尼克松对社会主义国家，特别是对亚洲的社会主义国家进行诽谤，这是因为，这些国家早已摆脱了不邀自来的“监护人”而获得了自由和独立。
    本报讯　洛杉矶消息：美国副总统尼克松6日对洛杉矶大学学生发表演说，用维护“冷战”的陈词滥调，竭力挑拨亚非国家同苏联和中国的关系。
    尼克松硬说，苏联和中国正在把注意力集中在经济上处于初期状态的人民。非洲、亚洲和中东的人民在“自由”同“共产主义”的斗争中处于举足轻重的地位。尼克松希望它们不要“失去自由（即所谓‘自由世界’）”，并说美国有责任“保证”它们作出“选择”。
