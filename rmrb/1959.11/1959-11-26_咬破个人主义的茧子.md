    Biting Through the Cocoon of Individualism
    Yu Li
    My neighbor buying silk wadding to make clothes reminded me of silkworms and cocoons.
    When a silkworm develops to a certain stage, it spins silk to form a cocoon, wrapping itself tightly. It remains unaware of the birdsong and fragrant flowers, the wind and rain of the human world, neither knowing nor feeling, neither moving nor stirring. When the climate is right, it transforms into a moth, bites through the cocoon, and flies out, soaring in the vast expanse of the heavens and earth. My knowledge of silkworms is superficial, but judging by the situation and reasoning, I believe that the majority of silkworms are able to transform into moths, bite through their cocoons, and fly out, while only a very small number fail to progress, remaining in their cocoons and even suffocating to death within them.
    Humans are different from silkworms; they do not spin silk, nor do they form cocoons. They only reel silk and weave cloth, wrapping themselves for warmth. This is common knowledge. However, upon closer observation, people often act in ways similar to silkworms. Some people, on the revolutionary path, after experiencing a certain period, will intentionally or unintentionally spin silk and form cocoons to bind themselves.
    There are some comrades like this: originally, their ideals were not so lofty. They joined the revolution solely to pursue low-level interests, such as fame, status, vanity...etc. When their low-level interests are temporarily satisfied, or when they believe there is great potential, they are beaming with joy. On the surface, they seem to be "wholeheartedly" devoted to the revolution. However, gradually, when they feel that the revolution is not as smooth as they originally thought, they reveal their "wavering" nature; furthermore, when these personal desires are struck, they then exhibit "disinterest". In this situation, they often feel lost about the future, but they are always unwilling to abandon their low-level interests and break through their narrow circle. In this situation, what driving force is there to move forward? Under the circumstances of helplessness, they can only be gloomy and dispirited. From then on, the cocoon of individualism is formed, pressing their ideals, life, and work into the cocoon, without seeking progress. They can only be a monk for a day, striking the bell for a day, and even the bell is not struck.
    There are also some comrades who, in the years of revolutionary war, braved the wind and rain, and went in and out of the hail of bullets. These comrades cannot be compared with the former, but their ideals are not necessarily lofty either. In the past, they had great enthusiasm for fighting landlords and fighting the Japanese devils, but what would happen after the landlords were fought and the Japanese devils were defeated? He did not want to think that far ahead. In the spare time amidst the busy military life, he would occasionally imagine having a good house after "the great success," doing something not too busy, having more leisure, or having more time to read... When his comrades criticized him for "having no great ambition in life," he was unconvinced and retorted, "Isn't the revolution for this?" Sure enough, now his "ideal" has been achieved. He has a wife, children, a good life, and a very warm family. Gradually, a gray cocoon is formed. When he looks back at his glorious journey, instead of becoming "more vigorous in his old age" and striving for greater glory, he has a "sense of decline." "Old! Old!" This sentence hangs on his lips all day long. In fact, he is not old in terms of age, but he is prematurely aging. In the Great Leap Forward, he hid in the cocoon, feeling cold and lonely. Outside the cocoon, ten thousand horses were galloping, and people were shouting, "Comrades! Let's work harder!" He then prolonged his vocal cords and muttered to himself, "Old! Old! No more oil to add!" He even showed political wavering, doubting and resisting the Party's line and policies.
    The above is actually only about the current situation of these two types of people. If viewed from the perspective of development, if they do not remove the roots of individualism and bourgeois viewpoints, when the climate suitable for their transformation arrives, they will turn into evil insects attacking the Party and socialism. Weren't the right-leaning opportunists' vicious attacks on the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes evolved in this way?
    All kinds of cocoons are individualistic things. Humans are not silkworms, and cocoons cannot be inhabited for long. The most ideal place should be the building of socialism and communism. Everyone is leaping forward, everyone is carrying bricks and soil to build the building. This is a season of sunny skies and gentle breezes, a time to break out of the cocoon. We should cheer up, break the tranquility inside the cocoon, and resolve to bite through the cocoons that bind us and fly out! (Originally published in Southern Daily)

### 咬破个人主义的茧子

    咬破个人主义的茧子
    于厘
    邻居买丝棉做衣裳，使我联想起蚕和茧。
    蚕发育到相当时期，便吐丝结茧，把自己缠得紧紧的，任人间鸟语花香，风风雨雨，它不知也不觉，动也不动，到了适当的气候条件下，它才化成蛾，咬破了茧，飞出来，在广阔的天地间飞翔。关于蚕的知识我很肤浅，但是量情度理，相信能够化成蛾咬破茧子飞出来的蚕占多数，而毫不长进，老是躲在茧子里以至窒死在茧里的只是极少数。
    人不同于蚕，不会吐丝，也不会结茧，只会缫丝织布，裹身取暖。这是常识。不过，细心观察一下，人往往有类似蚕一样的作为的。有些人在革命的途程上，经历了一个时期之后，有的人也会有意无意地吐丝结茧把自己束缚起来的。
    有这样的一些同志：本来，他们的理想并不是那么高尚，参加革命，唯一地是为了追求低级趣味，诸如名誉、地位、虚荣……等。当他那种低级趣味得到暂时满足，或者他认为大有奔头的时候，就眉飞色舞，表面看来，他对革命似乎是“一心一意”的。可是渐渐的当他感到革命并不如他原来想的那样得心应手的时候，便露出了“三心两意”的马脚；进而，这种个人欲望遭到打击的时候，则表现为“无心无意”了。在这种情况下，他往往感到前途茫然，但他总是不愿摒弃低级趣味，冲破狭隘的圈子。在这种情况下，靠什么动力前进呢？在无可奈何之下，他只可郁郁不乐，暮气沉沉。从此，个人主义的茧子便结成，把自己的理想、生活、工作压进茧里去，不求上进。只可做一日和尚，撞一日钟，甚至连钟也不撞。
    又有一些同志，在革命战争的年代里，风里来雨里去，出入枪林弹雨。这些同志与前者不能同日而语，但是他的理想也不见得高超，当年斗地主，打鬼子的劲头很大，可是斗了地主，打了鬼子又怎样呢？他不愿想的那么远。在戎马倥偬之余，他曾偶尔遐想着“大功告成”后有间好房子，做点不很忙的事，多消闲，或者多点时间读读书……。战友批评他“生平无大志”，他不服气，顶回一句：“革命不是为了这个？”。果然，现在“理想”达到了，老婆、孩子有了，生活不错，小家庭温暖非常，慢慢的，灰色的茧子便结成了。当他回顾一下自己走过的光荣历程时，却不是因此而“老当益壮”，争取更大的光荣，反而是有“迟暮之感”。“老了！老了！”这句话整日挂在嘴角。其实论年纪他并不老，只是未老先衰吧了。在大跃进中，他匿在茧子里冷冷清清，茧子外万马奔腾，人们高呼着：“同志们！加油干吧！”他则拉长声带，自言自语叹句：“老了！老了！没有油加了！”，甚至表现出政治动摇，对党的路线、政策产生怀疑和抵触。
    以上种种，其实只是就这两种人的现状说的。如果从发展上去看，他们倘不去掉个人主义孽根和资产阶级的观点，在有了适合他们蜕变的气候的时候，他们便会化为进攻党和社会主义的恶虫。右倾机会主义分子恶毒地向党的总路线，大跃进和人民公社进攻，不也就是这样演化来的吗？
    形形色色的茧子都是个人主义的东西。人不是蚕，茧子不能久居，最理想的应当是社会主义、共产主义的大厦。人人在跃进，人人在为建设大厦挑砖担土。这是风和日丽的季节，是破茧而出的时候了。应当振作起来，打破茧子里的平静，决心把自己结起来束缚住自己的茧子咬破，飞出来！　（原载南方日报）
