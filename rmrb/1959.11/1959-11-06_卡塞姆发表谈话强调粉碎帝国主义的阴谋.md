    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, November 4th: Iraqi Prime Minister Qassem, in a speech to reporters at the "House of Peace" Hospital on the evening of November 3rd, emphasized that our current responsibility is to crush the conspiracies and sabotage of imperialism, so that it cannot make a comeback. He said, "Imperialists and those who covet this country are forever doomed to fail in this country. We guarantee to defend the motherland at all costs."
    Qassem said that those who assassinated him and the Iraqi Republic in fact "fear the liberation of Iraq, fear this irresistible trend, which will inevitably eliminate them and eliminate all reactionary forces, dictatorial forces, and all forces that violate the true democratic system." Qassem pointed out that when the problem develops to the point of assassination, it means that the forces hostile to the Iraqi Republic have suffered a huge political, moral, and rational defeat.
    He stated that he does not seek personal revenge, but must act according to the law. "This is a matter of punishing criminals and conspirators who attack our country's rights." Qassem said that imperialism and greedy groups have attempted to undermine Iraq's unity from the very beginning of the revolution, but Iraq has thwarted their attempts, because the purpose of our revolution is clear, and the republic is built on a solid foundation of unity.
  　Qassem called on everyone to unite. He said, "If we unite now to eliminate imperialism and consolidate the structure of our republic, then, even if we have some problems, we will solve them among ourselves in the near future."

    卡塞姆发表谈话强调粉碎帝国主义的阴谋
    新华社巴格达4日电　伊拉克总理卡塞姆3日晚间在“和平之家”医院向记者发表谈话时强调说，我们目前的责任，是要粉碎帝国主义的阴谋破坏，使它不能卷土重来。他说，“帝国主义者和那些垂涎这个国家的人将永远注定在这个国家里失败。我们保证不惜牺牲来保卫祖国。”
    卡塞姆说，那些谋杀他和谋杀伊拉克共和国的人事实上“害怕伊拉克解放，害怕这股势不可挡的潮流，这股潮流不可避免地将把他们清除掉，并且消灭掉一切反动势力、独裁势力和违反真正民主制度的一切势力”。卡塞姆指出，当问题发展到采取暗杀手段时，这就意味着，敌视伊拉克共和国的势力在政治上、道义上和道理上遭到巨大失败。
    他表示不谋求个人报复，但是必须按法律行事。“这是惩戒攻击我国权利的罪犯和阴谋分子的问题。”卡塞姆说，帝国主义和贪婪集团从革命一开头就企图破坏伊拉克的团结，但是伊拉克使他们的企图归于失败，因为我们革命的目的是明确的，共和国是建立在牢固的团结的基础之上的。
  　卡塞姆要求大家团结起来。他说，“如果我们现在就团结一致，来消灭帝国主义、巩固我们共和国的结构，那么，假使我们有一些问题，我们将在最近的将来在我们自己中间加以解决”。
