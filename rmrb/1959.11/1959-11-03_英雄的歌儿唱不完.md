The Song of Heroes Sings Endlessly

	On the afternoon of the 31st, before the opening of the "Conference of Heroes," composer Zheng Lvcheng stepped onto the podium in the Great Hall of the People. More than six thousand representatives, following the composer's rising and falling gestures, sang "Song of Red Heroes." The music was melodious, the singing was loud and clear, and the representatives sang it six or seven times, becoming more and more excited. The accordions also played with increasing gusto, and many representatives soon learned the song. This song of the Great Leap Forward expressed the inner passion of each representative. Ren Zhaomin, a representative of the family members of workers from the Longyan Steel Company in Zhangjiakou, was sixty years old this year, and today she couldn't help but sing along with everyone in a loud voice.

	Seeing everyone below the stage singing at the top of their lungs, Zheng Lvcheng waved his arms even more vigorously. More than twenty years ago, he had also conducted a large chorus of several thousand people at the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan'an, but from the Yan'an square to the magnificent Great Hall of the People, from the revolutionary "seeds" to today's advanced producers, what a huge and profound change this is! All this inspired Zheng Lvcheng, and in the past two days, he composed the music for "Song of Red Heroes," "Red Flag Pacesetter March," and "Singing the 'Conference of Heroes'" in one breath, expressing his deep respect for the heroes.

    英雄的歌儿唱不完
    31日下午，“群英会”开会前，作曲家郑律成登上了人民大会堂的指挥台，六千多名代表随着作曲家时起时伏的手势，唱起了“红色英雄歌”。乐声悠扬，歌声嘹亮，代表们连唱六七遍，越唱越高兴，手风琴也越拉越带劲，许多代表不久就学会了这只歌子。这跃进之歌抒发着每个代表内心的激情。张家口市龙烟钢铁公司职工家属代表任诏敏大妈，今年六十岁了，今天情不自禁地跟着大家高声唱了起来。
    郑律成看到台下人人引吭高歌，手臂挥舞得更有劲。二十多年前他在延安抗日军政大学也曾经指挥几千人的大合唱，但是从延安的广场到宏伟的人民大会堂，从革命的“种子”到今天的先进生产者，这是多么巨大而深刻的变化啊！这一切启发着郑律成，他最近两天中一口气为“红色英雄歌”“红旗手舞进行曲”“歌唱‘群英会’”谱了曲，表示对英雄们深深的敬意。
