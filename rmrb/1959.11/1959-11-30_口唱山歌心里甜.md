Singing Mountain Songs with a Sweet Heart

    Good Year
    The land of fruits has a good year,
    Two harvests above and below the trees,
    Below the trees, the grain ears are heavy,
    Above the trees, the apples are like balls.
    After the people's commune, water and fertilizer are sufficient,
    The fruit-growing area has bumper harvests every year.
      (Song Zuoren, Changli, Hebei)

    Sending Public Grain
    The rice fragrance spreads for ten miles in the wind,
    The good news of a bumper harvest spreads in all directions,
    The dried and clean grains are plump,
    Commune members are busy day and night sending grain.
    The bright moon hangs in the sky, the evening breeze is cool,
    Shouldering public grain gleams with golden light,
    The heart is happy and the eyes are bright,
    Grateful to the Communist Party for the bumper harvest.
        (Gong Jinfu, Guangdong)

    Sweet Potato Mountain
    Silver hoes turn over the mountains and fields,
    The sweet potato transport team is a continuous line,
    The carrying poles creak, the songs float,
    In the blink of an eye, a mountain of sweet potatoes piles up on the ground.
      (Yang Jiwu, Chongqing)

    Fighting the "Three Autumns"
    A bend in the field,
    A bend in the water,
    Red buildings nearby, mountains in the distance,
    The scenery surpasses Jiangnan.
    Working happily,
    Singing happily,
    Fierce battle for the "Three Autumns," striving to be first,
    Bumper harvest is in sight.
        (Chongqing Folk Song)

    Sing a Mountain Song to Celebrate the Bumper Harvest
    Bumper harvest fields connect to bumper harvest fields,
    Grain ears form a golden carpet,
    Embroidered on it is a line of poetry:
    The People's Commune will last ten thousand years.
    When there is more grain, there are more songs,
    A hundred loads of grain, ten thousand songs,
    Just finished singing a song on the upper hill,
    Ten baskets of grain have already been threshed on the lower hill.
    Singing mountain songs with a sweet heart,
    Everyone celebrates the bumper harvest year,
    Production leaps forward again and again,
    Happiness is added day by day.
          (Guangdong Folk Song)

    口唱山歌心里甜
    好年头
    花果之乡好年头，
    树上树下两个秋，
    树下谷穗沉甸甸，
    树上苹果像皮球。
    公社化后水肥足，
    果乡年年闹丰收。
      （河北昌黎宋作人）
    送公粮
    稻谷迎风十里香，
    丰收喜讯传四方，
    晒干风净谷粒壮，
    社员日夜送粮忙。
    明月当空晚风凉，
    肩挑公粮闪金光，
    心里乐来眼里亮，
    丰收感谢共产党。
        （广东龚锦富）
    薯堆山
    满山遍野银锄翻，
    运薯队伍一线牵，
    扁担叽咕歌声飘，
    转眼地坝堆薯山。
      （重庆杨继武）
    战“三秋”
    田一弯，
    水一弯，
    近处红楼远处山，
    风物胜江南。
    干的欢，
    唱的欢，
    三秋激战竞争先，
    丰收在眼前。
        （重庆民歌）
    唱支山歌庆丰年
    丰收田连丰收田，
    谷穗结成黄金毯，
    上面绣出诗一句：
    人民公社万万年。
    谷子多来歌也多，
    百担谷子万支歌，
    上丘刚唱歌一首，
    下丘已打谷十箩。
    口唱山歌心里甜，
    人人喜庆丰收年，
    生产跃进再跃进，
    幸福生活日日添。
          （广东民歌）
