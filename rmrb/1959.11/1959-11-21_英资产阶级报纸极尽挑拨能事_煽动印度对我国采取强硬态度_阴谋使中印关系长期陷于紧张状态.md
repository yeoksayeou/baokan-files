Xinhua News Agency, London, November 20th: Following Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on November 7th proposing a solution to the Sino-Indian border issue, all British bourgeois newspapers immediately clamored and stirred up trouble, attempting to distort and denigrate Premier Zhou's proposals, inciting India to adopt a tough stance towards China, rejecting the proposals put forward by the Chinese side, and instigating India to put forward counter-proposals, plotting to keep relations between China and India in a state of long-term tension.

The "Times," in its editorial on the 10th, slandered China's proposal as requiring India "to withdraw its troops from territory which, according to treaties, can be declared to belong to it," and that "this practice still allows the Chinese to control large areas." This newspaper clamored that "it is still extremely doubtful whether the Indian government can start negotiations on Beijing's terms." It hinted that India should "respond with its own proposals" and reminded India to insist on the McMahon Line as a "basis." The "Times" also took the opportunity to stir up Sino-Indian relations, viciously attacking the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, saying that India "no longer holds any sincere hope" for Sino-Indian friendship and that "the Five Principles of Coexistence hang on the wall like a tattered manuscript. The political damage is irreparable."

The "Times" published on the 16th an article written by its correspondent in Delhi, continuing to provoke Sino-Indian relations. The article maliciously described China's proposal as a "rather obvious hook," which would not only bring "strategic disadvantage" to India, but also "seemingly recognize the validity of China's claims in Ladakh." The reporter "predicted" that India's yet-to-be-announced response to China "will in effect amount to a rejection" of China's proposal, but in terms of wording "will leave a way out for counter-proposals."

The "Economist" also published an article on the 14th that blatantly incited India to reject China's proposal. The article began with an arbitrary and negative tone, saying that Premier Zhou's proposal had come "too late" and that it "cannot eliminate all the damage done to Sino-Indian relations." It used an inflammatory tone, saying, "This (the proposal for the withdrawal of troops on both sides) will certainly help avoid military conflict. However, in Kashmir, doing so would amount to de facto agreement to China's 'actual control' of six thousand square miles of Ladakh."

The Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" slandered China's proposal in an editorial as being "entirely in China's favor" and as a "common trick of aggressors." It viciously described China's proposal as "first seizing more than one hopes for, and then generously returning part of it." Another Conservative newspaper, "The Scotsman," also blatantly clamored, "This proposal is certainly unacceptable." It provoked by saying that China's proposal was "insult added to injury" for India, that "Nehru faces a serious problem," and that "on this issue, the non-communist world stands with India."

The Liberal Party's "Guardian" slandered China as "theoretically taking a step back while actually affirming a point," and promoted the so-called "reefs" in China's proposal. The "News Chronicle's" editorial incited that China's proposal "on the surface has a more conciliatory tone" but is actually "as aggressive as ever." It blatantly demanded that India take "action" and adopt "decisive measures." It also demanded that Nehru "change his policy towards Kashmir" because "hostility with Pakistan will keep most of India's forces away from the Himalayan border region."

According to British newspapers, the British government is currently engaged in "behind-the-scenes work" on a "joint defense arrangement" between Pakistan and India. A British government spokesperson recently announced that the British government has been "closely following" the Sino-Indian border situation and maintaining "close contact" with the Nehru government.

    英资产阶级报纸极尽挑拨能事
    煽动印度对我国采取强硬态度
    阴谋使中印关系长期陷于紧张状态
    新华社20日讯　伦敦消息：周恩来总理11月7日在给印度总理尼赫鲁的信中提出解决中印边界问题的建议之后，英国所有的资产阶级报纸立即鼓噪而起，极力歪曲和诋毁周总理的建议，煽动印度对中国采取强硬态度，拒绝中国方面提出的建议，并且唆使印度向中国提出反建议，阴谋使中印两国之间的关系长期处于紧张状态。
    “泰晤士报”在10日的社论中诬蔑中国的建议是要印度“从根据条约可以宣布确实属于它的领土上撤走军队”，“这种做法仍然让中国人控制大片地区”。这家报纸扬言，“印度政府是否能按北京的条件开始谈判仍然是极其值得怀疑的”。它暗示印度要“提出自己的建议来回答”，并且提醒印度要坚持麦克马洪线作为“基础”。“泰晤士报”还趁机大肆挑拨中印关系，恶毒攻击和平共处的五项原则，说印度对中印友谊“不再留有什么真诚的希望了”，“五项共处原则像破烂的稿本一样地挂在墙上。政治上的损害已无法挽回”。
    “泰晤士报”16日又发表了该报驻德里的记者写的一篇文章，继续挑拨中印关系。文章恶意地把中国方面的建议说成是“相当明显的鱼钩”，是不仅会给印度“在战略上带来不利”，而且“看来也将像是承认中国在拉达克的要求的有效性”。这位记者“预言”，尚未宣布的印度对中国的答复“实际上将等于拒绝”中国的建议，但是在措辞方面“将为提出反建议留有后路”。
    “经济学家”在14日也发表一篇露骨地煽动印度拒绝中国建议的文章。文章辟头就以武断的否定的语气说：周总理的建议已经来得“太迟了”，它“已无法消除中印关系所受到的全部损害”。它用煽动的口吻说，“这（双方军队后撤的建议）当然有助于避免军事冲突。可是，在克什米尔，这样做将等于在事实上同意中国对拉达克六千平方英里地方的‘实际上的控制’”。
    保守党的“每日电讯报”在社论中诬蔑中国建议“完全是对中国有利的”，是“侵略者的惯技”。它恶毒地把中国的建议说成是“先夺取比希望为多的地方，然后慷慨地归还其中的一部分”。另一家保守党报纸“苏格兰人报”也露骨地叫嚷道，“这个建议肯定是不能接受的”。它挑拨说，中国的建议是对印度“在损害之上又增加了侮辱”，“尼赫鲁面临着一个严重的问题”，而“在这个问题上，非共产党世界是站在印度一边的”。
    自由党的“卫报”诬蔑中国是“理论上让一步而在实际上肯定一点”，宣扬中国的建议中有所谓“暗礁”。“新闻纪事报”的社论煽动说，中国的建议“表面上语气比较和解”，实际上“和过去一样地咄咄逼人”。它露骨地要求印度有所“作为”，采取“断然的行动”。它还要求尼赫鲁“改变他对克什米尔的政策”，因为，“同巴基斯坦的敌对会使印度大部分兵力远离喜马拉雅边境地区”。
    据英国报纸透露，英国政府目前正在进行巴基斯坦同印度的“联防安排”这一“幕后工作”。英国政府发言人不久以前曾经宣布，英国政府一直在“密切关心”中印边境局势，并且同尼赫鲁政府保持着“密切接触”。
