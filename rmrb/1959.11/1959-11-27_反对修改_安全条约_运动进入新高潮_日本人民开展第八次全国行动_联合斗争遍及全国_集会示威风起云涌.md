Xinhua News Agency, November 26th, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party's official newspaper, "Akahata," published an editorial on the 25th, calling on the Japanese people to exert all their efforts to make the eighth national unified action against the revision of the "Security Treaty," scheduled for November 27th, a success.

The editorial said that petitions to the Diet, local governments, and local assemblies by people from all walks of life are currently the most important joint actions to demonstrate the strength and determination of the people.

The editorial pointed out that the Japanese people's struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" now has a solid organizational foundation, and the people's struggle is surging. The Kishi Nobusuke government and reactionary forces, fearing the rising tide of the democratic forces' struggle, are intensifying their divisive activities. This shows the reactionaries' wavering and lack of confidence. Therefore, as long as the democratic forces rapidly develop on a larger scale, it is possible to force the reactionaries to retreat, thereby achieving victory.

The editorial concluded: "The victory of this struggle will be the starting point of new victories. Let us strive to establish a national democratic united front in the process of struggle."

Xinhua News Agency, November 26th: (Reported by our reporter) The Japanese people are stepping up their unity, working together to oppose the conspiracy of the US-Japan reactionaries to fully reveal their intention to revise the US-Japan "Security Treaty."

On November 27th, the Japanese people will hold a massive eighth national unified action against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty." As more and more people clearly recognize the importance of unity in the struggle, joint struggle organizations of the Japanese people against the "Security Treaty" are rapidly increasing across the country like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Currently, there are 690 joint struggle organizations across the country, including the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and various groups, which is twice the number of joint struggle organizations formed during the opposition to the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" last autumn. These organizations have not only spread throughout Japan's 46 prefectures, but also established 644 organizations at the grassroots level such as cities, towns, and villages.

Joint struggle organizations have also been established in various industries. At the end of October, farmers' groups such as the All-Japan Farmers Association Federation established a national joint struggle organization for farmers – the "Farmers Liaison Conference to Implement Farmers' Demands and Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty." Legal professionals have established the "Lawyers' Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty." Cultural figures have established five organizations against the "Security Treaty," and they are actively carrying out publicity activities through issuing statements, articles, and holding lectures.

Now, opposing the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" has become the common struggle goal of all progressive groups in Japan, and almost no group fails to make a decision against the "Security Treaty" when holding meetings. Recently in Japan, hardly a day goes by without a rally or demonstration against the "Security Treaty." The Japanese Communist Party recently decided to organize 1,500 rallies against the "Security Treaty" throughout the country. The All-Japan Farmers Association Federation, the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, and other groups are also organizing hundreds of mass rallies.

The Japanese people's struggle with the US-Japan reactionaries over the "Security Treaty" issue has entered a critical juncture. In order to cooperate with the United States' conspiracy to escalate tensions in Asia, the Kishi Nobusuke government has decided that Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke himself will lead a delegation to Washington in mid-January next year to sign a new "Security Treaty." The "Economic Reconstruction Roundtable Conference," an organization that provides funds to political parties for Japanese monopoly capitalists, has agreed to provide 300 million yen to the Liberal Democratic Party as funding for deceptive propaganda for the revision of the "Security Treaty." Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama has recently revealed that the new treaty is an aggressive military alliance treaty that openly antagonizes China and the Soviet Union. It will turn Japan into the largest nuclear war base for the United States in Asia, making the Japanese people cannon fodder for the United States' aggressive wars, and it will seriously threaten peace and security in the Far East and Asia.

Therefore, preventing the US-Japan reactionaries from signing a new military alliance treaty has become the most urgent struggle task for the Japanese people. Now, with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, the Japanese people are closely uniting and intensifying their struggle. In the upcoming eighth national unified action against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," people across Japan will hold strikes, rallies, and demonstrations. In Tokyo, 100,000 people will go to the Diet to petition against the US-Japan "Security Treaty," thereby launching a new climax against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, November 26th, Tokyo dispatch: The movement of the Japanese people against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" is flourishing everywhere.

Thirty cultural leaders from the Japanese "Security Treaty Criticism Society" continued their propaganda movement against the revision of the "Security Treaty" in Tokyo on the 25th in three cars equipped with loudspeakers. From the cars, they called on Tokyo residents to participate in the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty." These thirty cultural leaders include: critic Yoko Matsuoka, poet Sumako Fukao, painter Toshiko Maruki, film director Satsuo Yamamoto, actor Masao Mishima, etc.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan conducted the same propaganda movement in Tokyo on the 24th. The thirteen cars it dispatched had banners on them that read: "Oppose the revision of the Security Treaty," "Oppose the ratification of the compensation agreement signed with South Vietnam," and "Relief for the unemployed, don't buy Lockheed aircraft."

In Osaka, one hundred young workers held a demonstration in the city on bicycles on the 25th, publicizing the dangers of revising the "Security Treaty" to citizens.

Five hundred women in this city held a rally on the 24th and passed a resolution demanding that the government abide by the United Nations Charter and abolish the US-Japan "Security Treaty." They also held a demonstration after the meeting. That evening, workers in Osaka held a lantern parade in the industrial area.

In Fukuoka Prefecture, marches began on the 24th, divided into three routes. The marching teams are scheduled to converge in Fukuoka City on the 27th, where they will hold a mass rally against the "Security Treaty." The marchers held up signs that read: "Oppose the revision of the Security Treaty," "Oppose the mass layoffs of coal miners," and "Give us work." It is estimated that the number of participants in the march will reach 20,000.

In Ehime Prefecture, the same march will begin on December 8th. Along the way, the marchers will present their demands to local governments and assemblies.

In Gunma Prefecture, seventy groups have already begun activities against the revision of the "Security Treaty." In many places, lectures, film evenings, and women's meetings against the "Security Treaty" are held almost every day. The propaganda movement is also actively carried out in rural areas. This prefecture has also begun a signature campaign against the "Security Treaty."

On November 13, the people of Tokyo demonstrated in front of the Diet, protesting against the Kishi government's traitorous conspiracy to revise the "Security Treaty." The picture shows the demonstrating masses in front of the Diet.

    反对修改“安全条约”运动进入新高潮
    日本人民开展第八次全国行动
    联合斗争遍及全国　集会示威风起云涌
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”25日发表社论，号召日本人民竭尽全力使定于11月27日举行的第八次反对修改“安全条约”全国统一行动获得成功。
    社论说，各阶层人民向国会、地方政府和地方议会进行请愿，在目前是显示人民的力量和决心的最重要的联合行动。
    社论指出，现在，日本人民反对修改“安全条约”的斗争具有巩固的组织基础，人民的斗争正在高涨。害怕民主力量的斗争日益高涨的岸信介政府和反动势力，正在加紧进行分裂活动。这说明反动派的动摇和缺乏信心。因此，只要民主力量在更大的规模上迅速发展，就有可能迫使反动派退却，从而取得胜利。
    社论最后说：“这次斗争的胜利将是新的胜利的起点。让我们在斗争的过程中争取建立全国民主统一阵线。”
    新华社26日讯　本社记者报道：日本人民正在加紧团结他们的队伍，同心协力地反对美日反动派的图穷匕现的修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋。
    11月27日，日本人民将举行规模巨大的第八次反对修改日美“安全条约”全国统一行动。由于越来越多的人清楚认识到团结一致在斗争中的重要性，日本人民反对“安全条约”的联合斗争组织像雨后春笋一般在全国各地迅速增加。现在，全国各地包括共产党、社会党和各界团体在内的联合斗争组织已经达到六百九十个，等于去年秋季反对修改“警察官职务执行法”时组织起来的联合斗争组织数目的两倍。这些组织不仅早已遍及日本四十六个都、道、府、县，而且在市、镇、村等基层单位也已经建立了六百四十四个。
    联合斗争组织在各行业中也纷纷成立。全日本农民协会联合会等农民团体在10月底成立了农民的全国性联合斗争组织——“贯彻农民要求和阻止修改安全条约农民联络恳谈会”。法律界人士成立了“法律家阻止修改安全条约会议”。文化界人士已经成立了五个反对“安全条约”的组织，它们正在通过发表声明、文章和举行演讲会等方式，积极展开宣传活动。
    现在，反对修改日美“安全条约”已经成为日本所有进步团体的共同的斗争目标，几乎没有一个团体开会时不作出反对“安全条约”的决定。最近在日本，几乎没有一天没有反对“安全条约”的集会或示威游行。日本共产党最近决定在全国各地组织一千五百个反对“安全条约”的集会。全日本农民协会联合会、恢复日中邦交国民会议和其他团体也都在组织数以百计的群众大会。
    日本人民同美日反动派围绕“安全条约”问题进行的斗争已经进入了紧要关头。为了配合美国在亚洲加剧紧张局势的阴谋，岸信介政府已经决定要由日本首相岸信介亲自率领代表团于明年1月中旬在华盛顿签订新的“安全条约”。日本垄断资本家向政党提供资金的组织“经济再建恳谈会”已经同意要向自由民主党提供三亿日元的资金，作为为修改“安全条约”进行欺骗宣传的经费。日本外务相藤山爱一郎最近透露，新条约是一个公然以中苏为敌的侵略性军事同盟条约。它将使日本变成美国在亚洲最大的核战争基地，使日本人民充当美国侵略战争的炮灰，它将严重威胁远东和亚洲的和平与安全。
    因此，阻止美日反动派签订新的军事同盟条约就成为日本人民当前最迫切的斗争任务。现在，日本人民在全世界爱好和平的人民的支持下，正在紧密地团结起来，加紧展开斗争。在即将举行的第八次反对修改美日“安全条约”全国统一行动中，日本全国各地人民将要举行罢工、集会和示威游行，在东京还将有十万人到国会前进行反对日美“安全条约”的请愿，从而掀起一个反对修改日美“安全条约”的新的高潮。
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的运动正在各地蓬勃发展。
    日本“安全条约批判会”的三十名文化界领袖25日在三辆装着扩音器的汽车上继续在东京进行反对修改“安全条约”的宣传运动。他们从汽车上号召东京居民参加反对修改“安全条约”的斗争。这三十名文化界领袖中包括：评论家松冈洋子、诗人深尾须磨子、画家丸木俊子、电影导演山本萨夫、演员三岛雅夫等。
    日本工会总评议会24日在东京进行了同样的宣传运动。它出动的十三辆汽车上挂着横幅标语，上面写着：“反对修改安全条约”，“反对批准同南越签订的赔偿协定”，“救济失业者，不要购买洛克希德式飞机”。
    在大阪，一百名青年工人25日骑着自行车在市内举行了示威，他们向市民宣传修改“安全条约”的危险。
    这个城市的五百名妇女24日举行集会，并且通过决议，要求政府遵守联合国宪章，废除日美“安全条约”。她们在会后还举行了示威游行。当天晚上，大阪的工人又在工业区举行了提灯示威游行。
    在福冈县，从24日开始分三路队伍举行游行。游行队伍预定27日在福冈市会师，并将在那里举行反对“安全条约”的群众大会。游行者们高举着标语牌，上面写道：“反对修改安全条约”，“反对大批解雇煤矿工人”，“给我们工作”。估计参加游行的人数将达两万人。
    在爱媛县，同样的游行将在12月8日开始举行。游行者在途中将向地方政府和议会提出他们的要求。
    在群马县，七十个团体已经开始了反对修改“安全条约”的活动。许多地方几乎每天都举行反对“安全条约”的演讲会、电影晚会以及妇女会议。宣传运动也积极地在乡村地区进行。这个县还开始展开了反对“安全条约”的征集签名运动。
    11月13日东京人民在国会门前示威，抗议岸政府修改“安全条约”的卖国阴谋。图为在国会前的示威群众。
