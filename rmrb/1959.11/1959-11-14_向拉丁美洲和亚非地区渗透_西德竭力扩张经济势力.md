Penetrating Latin America and Afro-Asian Regions
West Germany Exerts Itself to Expand Economic Influence

    This newspaper reports that, with the vigorous support of American monopoly groups, the power of West German monopoly groups has rapidly penetrated Latin America, Africa, and Asia.
    In terms of manufactured goods exports, West Germany has now surpassed Britain to rank second in the capitalist world, with exports totaling $8.8 billion last year. It is estimated that West Germany's export value this year will be as high as approximately $10 billion.
    West Germany's foreign investment has also grown rapidly in recent years. According to West Germany's "Die Welt" in January of this year, since the war, West Germany's total foreign investment has reached 18.1 to 19 billion West German marks (4.2 marks equal one dollar). Last year, West Germany's foreign investment exceeded Britain's long-term capital export annual average of 10 million pounds, reaching 180 million pounds, becoming one of the major capital exporting countries in the capitalist world, and the only country whose foreign investment increased during last year's capitalist economic crisis.
    The scope of West Germany's economic expansion extends to all regions of the capitalist world. Apart from North America and Western Europe, West Germany's economic expansion in Latin America is the largest. According to official announcements from the Bonn authorities, from February 1953 to March of this year, West German private direct investment in Latin America reached more than 650 million West German marks. West Germany's exports to Latin America are also substantial, accounting for 7.7% of Latin America's total imports, second only to the United States. Among Latin American countries, Brazil is the main target of West German economic expansion. West German private investment in this country accounts for 28% of its foreign investment.
    West Germany's direct private investment in Africa has reached 148 million West German marks. According to the Egyptian region of the UAR's Minister of Industry Sidqi, West German investment in the Arab Republic of Egypt has reached a total of $308 million. West German investment projects include steel plants, fertilizer plants, paper mills, oil pipelines, and power plants. In addition, West German economic power has also penetrated Libya, Morocco, Ethiopia, and Ghana.
    West Germany's direct private investment in Asia has also increased significantly. West German consortia have loaned the Indian government a huge sum of $425 million to build the Rourkela steel base. The technical assistance agreement signed between West Germany and Pakistan in the middle of this year has opened the way for West German economic power to penetrate. According to this agreement, the Pakistani government guarantees to import 120 million marks worth of West German goods this year and encourages West German private capital to invest in Pakistan.
    West German capital's activities in Asia have received direct support from the United States. In July, the United States held talks with West Germany through the World Bank on the establishment of the so-called "International Development Association." According to West Germany's "Die Welt," this institution will specialize in issuing "international investments that are not available in the international market" and is a sister bank of the World Bank. Its focus will be in Asia.
    West Germany's large-scale foreign expansion has intensified contradictions and competition in the capitalist world. U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce Edward complained: "German goods have surpassed American goods in competition." West Germany's expansion in Western Europe and other regions has also met with increasingly strong resistance.

### 向拉丁美洲和亚非地区渗透  西德竭力扩张经济势力

    向拉丁美洲和亚非地区渗透
    西德竭力扩张经济势力
    本报讯　由于美国垄断集团的大力扶植，西德垄断集团的势力已经迅速渗入拉丁美洲、非洲和亚洲地区。
    在制成品出口方面，西德目前已超过英国而居资本主义世界第二位，出口总额去年达八十八亿美元。估计今年西德出口总值将高达一百亿美元左右。
    西德对外投资几年来也有了迅速增长。据今年1月西德“世界报”估计，战后以来，西德对外投资总数已达一百八十一一百九十亿西德马克（四点二马克合一美元）。去年西德对外投资已经超过英国长期资本输出的每年平均数一千万英镑而达一点八亿英镑，成为资本主义世界主要资本输出国之一，是去年资本主义经济危机时期唯一对外投资有所增加的国家。
    西德经济扩张的活动范围，遍及资本主义世界各个地区。除北美和西欧外，西德对拉丁美洲的经济扩张规模最大。据波恩当局正式宣布：自1953年2月至今年3月，西德在拉丁美洲的私人直接投资达六亿五千多万西德马克。西德对拉丁美洲的出口也为数很大，占拉丁美洲进口总额的7.7％，所占比重仅次于美国。在拉丁美洲各国中，巴西是西德经济扩张的主要对象。西德在这个国家的私人投资占它对国外投资的28％。
    西德对非洲的直接私人投资，已达一亿四千八百万西德马克。据阿联工业部长西德基透露，西德在阿拉伯联合共和国埃及地区投资总额已达三亿八百万美元。西德投资项目包括有钢铁厂、肥料厂、造纸厂、油管和发电厂等。另外，西德经济势力也渗入利比亚、摩洛哥、埃塞俄比亚和加纳等国。
    西德对亚洲的直接私人投资也增加很大。西德财团曾贷款四亿二千五百万美元巨款给印度政府兴建鲁尔基拉钢铁基地。西德和巴基斯坦在今年中签定的技术援助协定，为西德经济势力渗入打开了道路。根据这一协定，巴基斯坦政府保证今年进口西德商品一亿二千万马克，并鼓励西德私人资本向巴基斯坦投资。
    西德资本在亚洲的活动得到了美国的直接支持。7月间，美国已通过世界银行和西德就建立所谓“国际开发协会”问题进行了会谈。据西德“世界报”透露，这个机构将专门发放“在国际市场上不能得到的国际投资”，是世界银行的姊妹银行。其活动重点地区将在亚洲。
    西德大规模地对外扩张，加剧了资本主义世界的矛盾和竞争。美国商务部副部长爱德华曾埋怨说：“德国商品在竞争中已超过了美国商品”。西德在西欧和其他地区的扩张活动也遭到了越来越强的抵制。
