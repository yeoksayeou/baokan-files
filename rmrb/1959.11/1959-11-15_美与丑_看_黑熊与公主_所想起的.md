Beauty and Ugliness
——Thoughts on "The Black Bear and the Princess"
	Qiū Yáng

	Fairy tale films have their own unique style: simple, clear, with distinct love and hate. They can align with children's appreciation and understanding, and can cultivate them, thereby embodying these principles in their behavior. I think this would not violate the filmmakers' original intention. If we insist on a fairy tale film accommodating and embodying more complex philosophical ideas, and measure success or failure by this, it may not be entirely realistic.

	Based on this understanding, I affirm the achievements of the East German film "The Black Bear and the Princess."

	The development of the plot, in certain parts, is similar to some of our country's fairy tales, such as how people who know how to care for and help other creatures will ultimately receive their help in their own times of crisis. This simple cause-and-effect relationship was the theme of many fascinating fairy tales heard in childhood. It is not harmful for children to believe in such cause-and-effect, and I think our children will feel a sense of familiarity with this film because of it.

	Naturally, the film does not only express this one aspect. It has development and a deeper meaning than this. Through the experiences of the proud princess, the film shows children how the good and evil in one's heart, pride and humility, are directly related to the beauty and ugliness of one's appearance; and what kind of joy and happiness can be exchanged for good qualities such as labor, caring for, and helping others. In addition, the narration of these principles is connected to the process of the princess and prince's love arising and developing, thus avoiding dryness and rigidity. The development of the plot and the purpose of education are closely and simply integrated. This is not only very beneficial to children's understanding and learning, but also, in terms of the technique of unifying education and entertainment, the achievements of our German friends are worth learning from.

	Fairy tales do not reject the depiction of magical realms, and color films are even more conducive to this kind of depiction; however, the choice and application of color in this film is not just for showing off the bizarre. From the colors, we can see the correspondence to the theme and plot. The film often uses a set of rocks or a stretch of earthen slope across the lens to connect to the next scene. In addition to the conciseness of the writing, the color shades, cold and warm tones of these rocks and earthen slopes can also indirectly explain the content of the plot, and even foreshadow the development of the plot. It is not divorced from the story, and it forms the atmosphere necessary for the development of the plot, yet there are changes within it. For example, in the land monster's cave, the feeling of colorfulness constituted by golden trees, brown grass, blood-red coral rocks, etc., is fascinating, but it always has a feeling of affectation. It is beautiful, but it is unnatural and evil. At the end of the film, when the princess uses her passionate love to defeat the land monster's magic and cause the latter to perish, the surrounding colors change: it is still those scenes, but the colors are softer, more natural, and warmer, making people feel intimacy and simplicity, with a true idyllic pastoral tone. In contrast, it makes the color tone of the scenes before the land monster's demise even more bizarre. This is consistent with the film's intention to illustrate the relationship between beauty and ugliness and between affectation and nature, so that the audience can draw the same conclusion not only from the plot, but also from the feeling of color.

	Such color arrangement is full of life and not vulgar. An artwork, taking the land monster's cave mentioned earlier as an example, in the hands of a designer who simply understands the means of expression, may very well make it terrifying and hateful, but that would inevitably lose the far-reaching significance inherent in the changes in the current film, and it may also cause physiological disgust in the audience. Saying this does not mean ignoring the tendency, but simply wanting to explain that the effect of expressing clearly cannot rely on simple methods. The reason why evil things can temporarily bewilder people is precisely because they sometimes have a seemingly beautiful appearance. Revealing the ugliness beneath this "beauty" and counteracting it with true, vibrant beauty requires more complex labor and deeper conception. In this regard, I praise the achievement of the film's colors.

    美与丑
    ——看“黑熊与公主”所想起的
    丘扬
    童话片，有它自己独具的风貌：单纯、明净、爱憎鲜明，能够合乎孩子们的欣赏理解能力，能使他们得到一些陶冶，从而在自己的行为中体现这些道理，我想，这样也就不违背制片者的初衷了。如果一定要求一部童话片，容纳和体现更复杂的哲理，并且以此来衡量得失，也不一定就是顶现实的。
    基于这样的理解，我肯定民主德国影片“黑熊与公主”的成就。
    情节的开展，某些部分类如我国的某些童话，比如懂得爱护和救助别的生物的人，最终也会在自己的危难中得到它们的救助。这种单纯的因果关系，曾是儿时所听到过的许多迷人童话的主题，孩子们相信这样的因果，是没什么坏处的，而且，我想，我们的孩子们也会由此对这部片子感到亲切。
    自然，影片并不仅仅是表现这一个方面，它有发展，也有比这个方面较深一步的意思。通过骄傲的公主的遭遇，影片向孩子们显示：心灵上的善与恶、骄傲与谦逊是怎样直接关联着面貌的美与丑；劳动、关心和救助别人等等优良品质，能够换取到怎样的快乐和幸福。另外，这些道理的叙述，由于是和公主与王子之间爱情发生、发展的过程相联系着，因而就避免了乾瘪与生硬，情节的开展和教育的目的，结合得很紧密，很单纯。这样做除了会很有利于孩子们的理解和学习而外；就这种把教育性和娱乐性统一起来处理的技法而论，德国朋友们的成就，也是值得我们借鉴的。
    童话，不排斥神奇境界的描绘，特别是彩色片，就更加有利于这种描绘；但是，这部片子彩色的选择和运用，却不仅仅只是为了炫奇，从色彩上可以看到对于主题、情节的照应。影片常常用一组山石、一脉土坡划过镜头，接连起下一个场面，除去笔墨的精炼而外，这些山石、土坡的彩色浓淡冷暖之间，也都能从旁地说明着情节的内容，甚而预示出情节的发展，它和故事不脱节，而且形成了情节开展所必需的气氛，其中却又有变化。比如在土地怪的洞府里，金色的树、褐色的草、血红的珊瑚岩等等，所构成的色彩斑烂的感觉是迷人的，但它总有一种矫揉造作的感觉，是美的，但又是不自然的邪恶的。到了影片结尾，公主用自己热烈的爱情击退了土地怪的魔法，并使后者陷于灭亡的时候，周围的色彩就发生了变化：依然是那些景物，但是，色彩柔和了、自然了、温暖了，使人感到亲切、质朴，有真正的田园牧歌情调，相形之下，就使得土地怪没有灭亡之前的景物色调，更为怪异。这一点，正和影片所要说明的美与丑和矫饰与自然之间的关系相一致，使得观众不但可以从情节上，而且从色调的感觉上，得到相同的结论。
    这样的色彩安排是有生命的、不庸俗的。艺术品，即以前边所举的土地怪的洞府为例，放在简单地理解了表现手段的设计家手里，很可能把它搞的恐怖可憎，然而那也就必然会失去了现在影片的变化中所内涵的深远意义，而且也很可能引起观众的生理厌恶。这样说，并不就是忽略了倾向性，只是想说明，表现明确的效果，不能依靠简单的方法。邪恶的事物之所以一时能蛊惑人，正因为它有时却具有貌似美丽的外表，揭示这种“美丽”下边的丑陋，并以真正的、有生命的美丽来与之抗衡，是需要更复杂的劳动和更深沉的构思的，就这一点而论，我赞美这部影片色彩的成就。
