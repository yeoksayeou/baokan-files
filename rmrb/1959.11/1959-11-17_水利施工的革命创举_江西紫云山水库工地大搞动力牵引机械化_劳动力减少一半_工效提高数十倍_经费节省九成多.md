It is entirely possible to continue a large-scale mass water conservancy construction movement this winter and next spring, with more magnificent momentum, more sound organization, higher efficiency, and better quality than the 1958 water conservancy upsurge. Party committees and people's committees at all levels must fully recognize this situation and actively lead this movement.

Vigorously engage in tool reform and technological innovation, gradually realize construction mechanization and semi-mechanization, and launch a high work efficiency movement. – Instructions from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Vigorously Engaging in Water and Fertilizer

Revolutionary Innovation in Water Conservancy Construction

The Ziyun Mountain Reservoir Construction Site in Jiangxi Vigorously Implements Mechanization with Powered Traction

Labor Reduced by Half, Work Efficiency Increased by Dozens of Times, Expenses Saved by Over 90%

Nanchang, November 16th (Our Newspaper) – The victory against right-leaning tendencies and the blossoming of tool reform – the construction of the Ziyun Mountain Reservoir in Fengcheng County, Jiangxi, has realized soil mechanization, increasing work efficiency by dozens of times, shortening the construction period by one year, and enabling the construction of two reservoirs with the manpower, materials, and financial resources of one reservoir.

The Ziyun Mountain Reservoir is a medium-sized water conservancy project with a storage capacity of over 100 million cubic meters and irrigates 300,000 mu of farmland. During the three construction periods from last spring to this spring, due to insufficient tool reform work and low work efficiency, only half of the total earth and stone work was completed, delaying the start of the Golden Lake Reservoir within the same irrigation system. Now, the workers at the Ziyun Mountain Reservoir construction site have successfully created advanced water conservancy machines such as powered traction high-dam soil transport winches, long-distance soil transport double-rail trains, high-altitude soil transport single-rail trains, and uphill machines, enabling high-speed construction progress. In situations where the soil dam is 380 meters away and 15 meters high, the average work efficiency has increased by ten to sixty times compared to the original shoulder carrying of half a cubic meter or cart pushing of 0.7 cubic meters. Due to the increase in work efficiency, the construction period has been advanced from the originally planned completion in the winter of 1960 to the end of December this year, and the labor force has been reduced from 8,000 to 4,000. The earth and stone work has increased from the originally planned 250,000 cubic meters this winter to over 500,000 cubic meters. These saved manpower and resources have now been used on the Golden Lake Reservoir, allowing the reservoir, which irrigates 50,000 mu of land, to start construction one year ahead of schedule. At the same time, the construction cost of the Ziyun Mountain Reservoir has been reduced from 3.6 million yuan to 300,000 yuan. The money saved is not only enough for the entire project of the Golden Lake Reservoir, but also leaves 500,000 yuan to be used for the construction of the 130-li-long channels of the Ziyun Mountain Reservoir.

These soil machines created by the workers of the Ziyun Mountain Reservoir have the ability to ascend, descend, climb slopes, cross rivers, and traverse ridges. The traction parts of these machines can be driven by diesel engines, charcoal water pumps, and even ox power. The structure of these soil machines, except for the power part, is all bamboo, wood, iron wire, and rope. The high-dam soil transport winch is made using the principle of the dragon bone waterwheel. A ten-horsepower charcoal water pump drives more than 200 four-wheeled dump trucks fixed on the upper and lower rails, carrying soil around once every two minutes; transporting one cubic meter of soil, only eight people are needed for loading, and unloading is automatic. In this way, calculated on an eight-hour day, it can transport 240 cubic meters of soil, and the average work efficiency per person is more than 60 times higher than in the past. The long-distance soil transport double-rail train has a length of 780 meters from the starting point to the ending point, and cycles about once every three minutes, transporting one cubic meter of soil. This soil transport machine, also powered by a charcoal water pump, consists of 240 wheeled soil trucks fixed by an iron wire rope that rotates left and right. Working eight hours a day, it transports 160 cubic meters of soil. Twenty-five people are needed for loading and unloading, increasing work efficiency by more than 12 times. The structure and work efficiency of the high-altitude and high-dam single-rail soil transport trains are roughly the same as the previous two. The uphill machine can drive five human-powered carts uphill at a time, which can reduce ten laborers pulling carts.

The success of the Ziyun Mountain Reservoir in creating advanced machines is a victory against right-leaning tendencies. At the beginning, when the carpenters proposed to trial-produce these soil machines, right-leaning conservatives shook their heads in opposition, believing that "soil carpenters cannot make foreign machines," "the construction site has already realized cart transportation, and tool reform has reached its peak," and "it is not cost-effective to spend manpower and materials on these nondescript tools." However, the construction site Party committee resolutely supported the carpenters' suggestions, established a technical innovation committee from top to bottom, and submitted the opinions of the right-leaning conservatives and the suggestions of the carpenters to the masses for discussion. As a result, the masses posted more than 300 big-character posters, supporting the carpenters' suggestions and criticizing right-leaning conservative ideology. In order to meet the requirements for manufacturing soil machines, the construction site Party committee quickly established wood, bamboo, and iron factories, and organized logging teams to cut down miscellaneous trees in the reservoir's submerged area. In less than ten days, a high-dam soil transport winch was successfully manufactured and installed. However, many problems occurred during the operation of this machine, such as large wear of wooden wheels, slippage of iron wire ropes, jumping of wooden buckets, and derailment. At this time, right-leaning conservatives sarcastically said, "A hen hatching a duck – a waste of time," and said that they wanted to settle the "waste of manpower and resources" account with the Party committee. However, the Party committee secretary firmly used concrete examples to inspire the carpenters to persevere to the end, and gathered all the carpenters together to study and modify it. After repeated research and modification more than a hundred times, the high-dam soil transport winch was finally manufactured. The other five soil transport machines, from the start of the scaffolding to the calculation of the wooden wheel speed, the position of the wooden bucket, the erection of the wooden track, the fixing of the iron wire rope, and even the materials used for the accessories, were successfully designed and modified hundreds of times.

The success of the workers of the Ziyun Mountain Reservoir in creating advanced water conservancy machines through practical work, hard work, and ingenious work has been warmly praised by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government, the Rural Work Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, and the Water Conservancy and Electric Power Department. The Ministry of Agriculture also sent a congratulatory telegram. The Yichun Special District held an on-site meeting of commanders of projects with more than 10,000 mu, vigorously promoting the several advanced water conservancy machines created by the Ziyun Mountain Reservoir, and presented the construction site workers with a banner with the words "Pioneers of Mechanization with Powered Traction, Great Revolutionary Innovation in Water Conservancy Construction."

    在今冬明春继续展开一个大规模的群众性的兴修水利运动，并且比一九五八年的水利高潮，气势更磅礴、组织更健全、效率更高、质量更好，是完全可能的。各级党委和人委必须充分地认清这个形势，积极地把这一运动领导起来。

    水利施工的革命创举
    江西紫云山水库工地大搞动力牵引机械化
    劳动力减少一半　工效提高数十倍　经费节省九成多
    本报南昌16日电　反右倾的胜利，工具改革的花朵——江西丰城县紫云山水库施工实现土机械化，工效提高数十倍，工期缩短一年，以一个水库的人力、物力、财力兴修两个水库。
    紫云山水库是个蓄水一亿多方、灌溉三十万亩农田的中型水利工程，在去春到今春三个兴修期间，由于工具改革工作做得不够，工效不高，土石方只完成全部工程量的一半。因而使同一灌溉系统内的黄金水库迟迟不能开工。现在，紫云山水库工地职工成功地创制了动力牵引高坝运土卷扬机、远距离运土双轨列车、高空运土单轨列车、拉车上坝机等先进水利机具，使施工高速度地前进。运土在离土坝三百八十米、坝高十五米的情况下，平均工效比原来的肩挑半方、车推零点七方提高了十倍以至六十多倍。由于工效的提高，工期随之由原计划1960年冬完工提前到今年12月底，劳动力由八千人减少为四千人；土石方由原计划今冬完成二十五万方增加到五十多万方。现在已经把这些节省的人力、物力使用到黄金水库上，使这个灌田五万亩的水库提前一年开了工。同时，紫云山水库的施工经费由三百六十万元降低到三十万元，节省下的钱除了足够黄金水库全部工程所需费用外，还剩五十万元用作兴修紫云山水库总长一百三十华里的渠道。
    紫云山水库职工创造的这些土机械，都具有升高、下坡、爬坡、跨河、越岭的能力。这些机械牵引部分用柴油机、木炭抽水机，甚至牛力都能带动。这些土机械的结构除动力部分外，全部是竹木、铅丝和绳索。高坝运土卷扬机是采用龙骨水车的原理制成的，用十匹马力的木炭抽水机带动固定在上下轨上的二百多个四轮斗车，载着土每两分钟就能上下环行一周；运土一方，上土只需八个人，卸土自动。这样每天以八小时计算，运土达二百四十方，每人平均工效比过去提高六十倍以上。远距离运土双轨列车，由起点到终点长达七百八十米，每三分钟左右环行一次，运土一方。这部也由木炭抽水机作动力的运土机，是由一根铅丝绳固定着二百四十个带轮土方车而左右运转的。每天工作八小时，运土一百六十方。前后二十五人上下和卸土，工效提高十二倍多。高空和高坝单轨运土列车的结构和工效与前两种大体相同。拉车上坝机一次能带动五部人力车上坝，可减少十个拉车劳动力。
    紫云山水库创造先进机具的成功，是反右倾的胜利。一开始，当木工们提出试制这几种土机器的时候，右倾保守派摇头反对，认为“土木匠做不了洋机器”，“工地已经实现车子化，工具改革到了顶”，“在这些不三不四的工具上花费人力、物力不合算。”但工地党委对木工们的建议坚决地给以支持，从上到下成立了技术革新委员会，并把右倾保守派的意见和木工们的建议一齐交给群众讨论。结果，群众贴出三百多张大字报，支持了木工们的建议，批判了右倾保守思想。工地党委为了适应制造土机械的要求，迅速办了木、竹、铁等工厂，并组织伐木队到水库淹没区砍伐杂木。前后不到十天，就把一部高坝运土卷扬机制造成功并安装了起来。但是这部机器在运转当中发生了木轮磨损大、铅丝绳打滑、木斗跳动、越轨等许多问题。右倾保守派这时又冷讽热嘲地说“鸡孵鸭子——白忙”，并说要向党委算“劳民伤财”账。但党委书记坚定不移地用具体事例启发木工们坚持到底，并召集所有木工一起研究，一起修改。经过反复一百多次研究，一百多次修改，终于把高坝运土卷扬机制成了。其它五部运土机从搭架开始，到木轮转速的计算、木斗的位置、木轨的架设、铅丝绳的固定，一直到配件的用料，都经过上百次修改设计才成功。
    紫云山水库职工实干、苦干、巧干创制成功先进水利机具，得到了中央农业部、江西省委农村工作部和水利电力厅等单位热烈赞扬，农业部并发来了贺电。宜春专区在此召开了万亩以上工程指挥员的现场会议，大力推广了紫云山水库所创造的几种先进的水利机具，并送给工地职工一面写着“动力牵引机械化的先锋、水利施工巨大革命创举”字句的锦旗。（附图片）
