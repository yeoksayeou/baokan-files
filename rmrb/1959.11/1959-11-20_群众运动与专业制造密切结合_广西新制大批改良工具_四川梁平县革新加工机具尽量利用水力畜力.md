　　Mass Movement Closely Combined with Professional Manufacturing
　　Guangxi Newly Manufactures Large Quantities of Improved Tools
　　Liangping County, Sichuan, Renovates Processing Machinery, Utilizing Water and Animal Power as Much as Possible
　　This newspaper, Nanning, 19th dispatch: A new mass-based tool reform movement has unfolded in most areas of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. According to incomplete statistics, from October 1st to early November, various localities have newly manufactured more than 140,000 wooden carts and large quantities of harvesters, threshing machines, rice milling machines, new-style walking plows, double-wheeled double-shared plows, and soil crushing machines.
　　In the tool reform, the six special districts of Guilin, Nanning, Yulin, and Liuzhou have adopted the method of combining mass movements with professional manufacturing, establishing tool reform offices and command posts at all levels, with secretaries taking the lead to strengthen leadership. Currently, 60%–70% of urban and rural ironworkers, carpenters, and technicians have been organized to participate in the tool reform work. Many new farm tool factories and processing plants have been established in various localities. On the Guidongnan Plain, during the busy season of late rice harvesting, many farm tool factories, iron factories, carpenters, and professional personnel from agricultural tool research institutes have formed mobile performance teams, carrying self-made products, going deep into the fields to impart usage techniques, and paving the way for new farm tools. Pingnan and Daxin counties, with better water conservancy conditions, are vigorously developing comprehensive utilization of water resources. Water mills and waterwheels have been installed at the beaches and sluices of large rivers, small rivers, mountain ponds, and reservoirs, establishing semi-mechanized processing plants. In the minority autonomous counties of Sanjiang, Longsheng, Damiaoshan, Longlin, and Bama, members of the Miao, Yao, and Dong ethnic groups, based on the characteristics of the mountainous areas, are universally building steel cable transportation lines in the mountains, transporting bundles of grain, bundles of firewood, and timber in the air. The heavy labor of carrying on shoulders and backs for thousands of years is no longer seen in many mountain villages.
　　In the tool reform movement, people's communes in various localities have implemented the principle of relying on the masses and self-reliance. Taoxu Commune in Hengxian County lacked iron nails for making carts, so they collected scrap iron and made their own; lacking timber, more than 5,200 households voluntarily donated enough wood to make more than 2,000 carts; Luzhai County used scrap iron and scrap iron to cast axles and iron rims, overfulfilling the cart-making task.
　　At the same time, all localities attach great importance to the quality of tools. Farm tool factories in Nanning and Yulin special districts have universally established inspection systems and insisted that defective products not leave the factory. The large tools that have been promoted have generally undergone mass evaluation and appraisal to ensure good quality. More than 90% of the 14,000 wooden carts newly made in Tiandong County are sturdy and durable and meet the specifications.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 19th dispatch: Employees of the financial and trade departments and commune members in Liangping County, Sichuan Province, have innovated grain, cotton, and oil processing machinery, improved processing efficiency, and ensured the processing needs and outward transfer tasks of grain, cotton, oil, and other materials.
　　In terms of grain processing, to date, the county has adopted methods such as state-run, commune-run with state assistance, and joint state-commune operation, and has built a total of 161 small-scale hydraulic processing workshops and 989 animal-powered processing workshops, and two hydroelectric power station rice mills, more than three times more than last year. The processing capacity of brown rice has increased by more than five times compared with the same period last year. Rice processed using water and animal power accounts for more than 80% of the total processing volume.
　　In terms of cotton and oil processing, all forty-one communes in the county have realized mechanized processing of local products, all driven by water and animal power. Therefore, the average oil extraction rate of tung seeds in the county has increased from 30.89% last year to 34.7% this year; the average oil extraction rate of rapeseed has increased from 35% last year to 35.6%, with the highest reaching 38%; and the efficiency of oil processing has increased by 1.8 times compared with last year. This year's oil processing tasks and the outward transportation tasks of tung oil and rapeseed oil have been completed ahead of schedule. The county has successfully modified 25 hydraulic and animal-powered cotton gins, and the average daily cotton ginning volume of each cotton gin has increased from 400 catties last year to 1,200 catties. In addition, 3,175 pieces of machinery such as flour milling, slicing, sugar boiling, and tung seed shelling have also been modified and promoted.

    群众运动与专业制造密切结合
    广西新制大批改良工具
    四川梁平县革新加工机具尽量利用水力畜力
    本报南宁19日电　一个新的群众性的工具改革运动已在广西僮族自治区大部分地区展开。据不完全统计，从10月1日到11月上旬，各地已经新制出十四万多辆木车和大批收割器、打谷机、碾米机、新式步犁、双轮双铧犁、碎土机。
    在工具改革中桂林、南宁、玉林、柳州等六个专区，都采取群众运动与专业制造相结合的方法，层层建立工具改革办公室和指挥部，书记挂帅，加强领导。目前，60％—70％的城乡铁工、木工和技术人员，已经组织起来参加工具改革工作。各地新办了很多农具厂、加工厂。在晚稻收获大忙的桂东南平原上，许多农具厂铁工厂木工和农具研究所的专业人员，组成巡回表演队，携带自制产品，深入田间传授使用技术，为新农具挥旗开道。水利条件较好的平南、大新两县，大搞水力综合利用，大江、小河、山塘、水库的滩头闸口，都安装上水碓、水车，建立了半机械化的加工厂。在三江、龙胜、大苗山、隆林、巴马等少数民族自治县里，苗、瑶、侗等族社员们，根据山区特点，因地制宜地普建山间钢丝运输滑线，凌空飞运，禾捆、柴捆、木材，千百年来肩挑背驮的繁重劳动，已在很多山村看不到了。
    在工具改革运动中，各地人民公社都贯彻了依靠群众、自力更生的原则。横县陶墟公社造车子缺少铁钉，就收集废铁自己打制；缺乏木材，有五千二百多户人家就自动献出足够制造两千多架车子的木料；鹿寨县用废口铁、废铁铸造车轴、铁圈，超额完成了造车任务。
    同时各地都很重视工具的质量。南宁、玉林专区各农具厂，普遍建立验收制度，坚持废品不出厂。已推广的大件工具，一般都经过群众评比鉴定，保证质量良好。田东县新制成的一万四千辆木车，90％以上都坚固耐用，符合规格要求。
    新华社成都19日电　四川省梁平县财贸部门的职工和公社社员一起，革新粮、棉、油加工机具，提高加工效率，保证了粮、棉、油等的加工需要和外调任务的完成。
    在粮食加工方面，到目前为止，全县采取国家办、社办国家帮助、国家和公社合办等方式，共建成小型水力加工厂坊一百六十一处，畜力加工厂坊九百八十九处，水力发电站碾米厂两处，比去年增加三倍多；糙米加工能力比去年同期提高五倍以上；利用水力、畜力加工的大米，已占总加工量的80％以上。
    在棉花，油料加工方面，全县四十一个公社已实现了加工土机械化，全部用水力、畜力带动。因此，全县桐子的平均出油率由去年的30.89％提高到今年的34.7％；菜籽平均出油率由去年的35％提高到35.6％，最高达38％；油脂加工效率比去年提高一点八倍。今年的油脂加工任务和桐油、菜油外运任务，都已经提前完成。全县改制成功水力、畜力轧花机二十五部，平均每部轧花机的日轧花量，由去年的四百斤提高到一千二百斤。另外，还改制和推广了磨粉、切片、熬糖及桐子剥壳等机具三千一百七十五件。
