Jinan, November 21 (From our newspaper) - "One furnace leads, all furnaces follow." Shandong Province's iron and steel army is launching a massive wave of competition to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the high-yield, high-quality, low-consumption three-cubic-meter small blast furnace in the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory's smelting workshop. All indicators of iron and steel production are rising rapidly and comprehensively, showing a thriving and promising scene everywhere.

Since August 7, the three-cubic-meter small blast furnace in the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory's smelting workshop has consistently maintained high yield, high quality, and low consumption, setting an example in Shandong. In the first half of November, the utilization coefficient reached over 3.8, the pig iron qualification rate reached 100%, the coke ratio was below 0.9, the cost met national standards, and the production plan was overfulfilled by 190.72%.

One month ago, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on iron and steel workers to learn from the advanced experience of this small blast furnace in achieving high yield, high quality, and low cost, transforming the advanced level of advanced units into the social level. The effect was immediate, and the province's iron and steel production and quality significantly improved. In July, the province's average daily pig iron production was 3,208 tons, and the average utilization coefficient was 0.72. By October, the average daily production had surged to 6,278 tons, with the highest daily production reaching 6,795 tons, and the average utilization coefficient increased to 1.142. On the 19th of this month, it reached a new level, with the average utilization coefficient reaching 1.151. More than sixty three-cubic-meter small blast furnaces saw their utilization coefficients jump to 2, 3, or 4 and above, and fourteen 55 and 13-cubic-meter blast furnaces reached utilization coefficients of 2 and above. The pig iron qualification rate also gradually increased, while the coke ratio and cost decreased steadily. In July, the province's pig iron qualification rate was 72.8%, and in October, it rose to 80%. Looking at key areas such as Jinan and Changwei, after promoting the experience of the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory, costs were reduced by approximately 5% to 22%. The daily increase in pig iron production has promoted the rapid development of steel, steel materials, and other products.

Party organizations at all levels in Shandong Province have attached great importance to the experience of the small blast furnace in the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory in vigorously developing mineral powder sintering, large air volume, and high air temperature. First, Shu Tong, the First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, personally observed the entire production process of the small blast furnace in the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory, helped them summarize their experience, and called on the broad masses of workers to learn from the factory's experience. Immediately afterward, he convened an on-site meeting with the participation of leaders, workers, and technicians from iron and steel units across the province. After criticizing the right-leaning thoughts of a few doubters and conditionists, the iron and steel fighters held meetings such as worker congresses, pledge rallies, and skills competitions to express their determination. In a short period of time, the wave of competition to "learn from printing and dyeing, catch up with printing and dyeing, and surpass printing and dyeing" was launched from all corners. The workers' enthusiasm was extremely high. Two hours after seeing the newspaper report on the experience of the small blast furnace in the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory, the fourth workshop of the Zibo Nanding Iron Plant organized its entire team to travel to Jinan to learn on-site. More than 3,700 people in Jinan visited and studied at the printing and dyeing factory.

The characteristic of this promotion of the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory's experience, and also the guarantee for the rapid and comprehensive promotion of the experience, is that leading cadres go deep into reality and take the initiative. In order to promote the experience of the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory, Wang Shichao, the First Secretary of the Zibo Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, personally went to the Zhangdian Iron and Steel Plant and the fourth workshop of the Nanding Iron Plant to work with the workers to study and solve problems such as mineral powder sintering, which greatly improved the sintering quality and sintering rate. Then, he specifically convened an on-site meeting to promote the development of the "learn, catch up, and surpass" movement. The Changwei Prefectural Committee also specifically organized nine working groups to go deep into various factories to help promote the experience of the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory.

When promoting the experience of the small blast furnace in the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory, all localities have fully utilized the mass movement method of establishing pacesetters through "one furnace for experimentation, one furnace to lead, and all furnaces to follow," which has achieved very good results. At the beginning, some people still held skeptical attitudes, not believing that the utilization coefficient and pig iron qualification rate of the three-cubic-meter small blast furnace were so high. In response to this situation, all localities first concentrated their efforts on pilot projects on key furnaces to break superstition and eliminate doubt. After success, they quickly held on-site meetings and on-site training courses, organizing the entire team from leading cadres to workers in various factories to conduct actual operations on-site. Then, they further organized various factories to catch up with advanced furnaces, making the mass movement of "learn, catch up, and surpass" lively and vigorous. At the same time, internal counterpart and opponent competitions were also launched within various iron and steel production units. Many regions also launched a large-scale one-stop collaboration competition between factories, promoting the overall leap forward in various tasks.

When promoting the experience of the small blast furnace in the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory in accordance with local conditions, various localities generally carried out technical transformations on the small blast furnaces, implementing parallel, triple, or even quadruple connections of fans and hot blast stoves to increase air volume and air temperature, and improve the smelting intensity of the small blast furnaces. When promoting the Printing and Dyeing Factory's experience of vigorously developing artificial rich ore and conducting mineral powder sintering, the Party Committee Secretary of the Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee Iron Smelting Experimental Plant took personal command, with each committee member taking responsibility for their respective tasks, implementing a system of three meetings and three inspections per day. The workers were full of enthusiasm, successfully trial-producing four-slot double-layer water-washed mineral powder equipment, increasing mineral powder sintering from a daily output of 30 tons to 80 tons, with a grade of over 55% and iron oxide reduced to below 10%. At the same time, Jinan and other places vigorously developed the "ten-ization" tool reform movement, such as automation of feeding and water supply, rail transport within the factory, and semi-mechanization of drilling and plugging, to meet the needs of high-yield and high-quality small blast furnaces.

    山东广泛学习济南印染厂小高炉经验
    一炉带头 群炉追赶
    全省生铁日产量三个月中增长一倍，小高炉利用系数和生铁合格率大大提高
    本报济南21日电　“一炉带头，群炉追赶”，山东省的钢铁大军掀起声势浩大的学习、赶上、超过济南市印染厂冶炼车间三立方米小高炉高产优质低耗的竞赛热潮，钢铁生产的各项指标全面直线上升，到处是蒸蒸日上的大好景象。
    济南市印染厂冶炼车间三立方米小高炉，从8月7日以来，一直坚持高产、优质、低耗，在山东树起了一面红旗。11月上半月，利用系数达到3.8以上，生铁合格率达到100％，焦比在0.9以下，成本达到国家标准，超额190.72％完成了生产计划。
      自从一个月前中共山东省委号召钢铁职工学习这座小高炉高产、优质、低成本的先进经验，把先进单位的先进水平变为社会水平以后，立竿见影，全省钢铁产、质量显著提高。7月份全省平均日产生铁为三千二百零八吨，利用系数平均为0.72，到10月份，平均日产量就猛升到六千二百七十八吨，最高日产量达到六千七百九十五吨，平均利用系数提高到1.142；本月19日又更上一层楼，利用系数平均达到1.151；并且有六十多座三立方米小高炉的利用系数分别跃升到2、3、4以上，十四座五十五和十三立方米的高炉利用系数达到2以上的水平。生铁合格率也逐步提高，焦比、成本则节节下降。7月份全省生铁合格率为72.8％，10月份就上升到80％；焦比目前已从7月份的1.49，下降到1.168；从济南、昌潍等几个重点地区看，在推广济南印染厂的经验后，成本约降低了5％到22％。生铁生产的逐日高升，促进了钢、钢材等生产突飞猛进的发展。
    山东省的各级党组织都十分重视济南印染厂小高炉大搞矿粉烧结、大风量、高风温等方面的经验。首先，中共山东省委第一书记舒同亲自到济南印染厂观察小高炉的全部生产过程，帮助他们进行总结，并号召广大职工学习这个厂的经验，紧接着就召开了全省钢铁单位领导人员、工人、技术员参加的现场会议。钢铁战士们在批判了少数怀疑派、条件论者的右倾思想后，纷纷举行职工大会、誓师会、比武会等会议，表决心；在很短的时间内，“学印染、赶印染、超印染”的竞赛浪潮，就先后从各个角落掀起来。职工们的热情无比高涨；淄博南定铁厂四车间看到报纸介绍济南印染厂小高炉经验后的两小时，就组织全班人马乘车赶往济南实地学习。济南市先后到印染厂实地参观、学习的达到三千七百多人次。
    领导干部深入实际亲自动手，是这次推广济南印染厂经验的特色，也是经验得以迅速全面推广的保证。中共淄博市委第一书记王士超为推广济南印染厂经验，亲自深入到张店钢铁厂和南定铁厂四车间与工人一起研究解决矿粉烧结等问题，使烧结质量和烧结率都大为提高；然后就专门召开现场会议，推动了“学、赶、超”运动的开展。昌潍地委还专门组织了九个工作组，深入各厂帮助推广济南印染厂的经验。
    在推广济南印染厂小高炉的经验时，各地都充分运用了“一炉试验，一炉带头，群炉追赶”树标兵的群众运动方法，收到很好的效果。开始时，还有些抱有怀疑态度的人，不相信三立方米小高炉的利用系数和生铁合格率有那么高。针对这种情况，各地都首先集中力量在重点炉子上进行试点，以破除迷信，消除怀疑；成功后就很快的开现场会，现场训练班，组织各厂从领导干部到工人的全班人马去现场实际操作，然后就进一步组织各厂追赶先进炉，使“学、赶、超”的群众运动搞得有声有色，热火朝天。同时，各钢铁生产单位的内部也开展了对口、对手赛；不少地区的厂与厂之间还大闹一条龙协作竞赛，推动各项工作全面跃进。
    各地在因地制宜推广济南印染厂小高炉经验时，普遍对小高炉进行了技术改造，实行了风机、热风炉并联、三联，甚至四联，以加大风量和风温，提高小高炉的冶炼强度。省委、省人委炼铁试验厂在推广印染厂大搞人造富矿、进行矿粉烧结的经验时，党委书记亲自挂帅，各委员分工负责，实行一日三碰头、三检查的制度，工人的干劲十足，试制成功四槽双层水洗矿粉的设备，使矿粉烧结由日产三十吨，提高到八十吨，品位达到55％以上，氧化铁减少到10％以下。同时，济南等地还大搞上料、上水自动化，厂内运输轨道化，打眼、堵口半机械化等“十化”的工具改革运动，以适应小高炉高产优质的需要。
