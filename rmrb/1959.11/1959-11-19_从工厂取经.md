    Learning from Factories
    The new Precision Instrument major at Shanghai Jiao Tong University has grown rapidly with the assistance of relevant industrial departments in Shanghai.

    In the Great Leap Forward of production last year, Jiao Tong University established this new major based on the needs of Shanghai's industrial departments to develop towards advanced, large-scale, precision, and cutting-edge technologies. To cultivate specialized technical talents for the production sector more quickly, the first group of forty-six students were transferred from other majors, starting their studies from the third year. This required the teaching staff and equipment of the major to catch up rapidly. However, most of the seven teachers in the new teaching and research group were young and lacked professional knowledge in this field. Nevertheless, they worked diligently, and under the guidance and assistance of the school and relevant business departments, they revised the teaching plan, undertook the task of offering seven professional courses within one to two years, and personally made seven friction torque testers.

    The reason they were able to achieve the above was mainly due to the favorable conditions of having many factories in Shanghai that produce precision instruments. Teachers, while studying on their own to prepare lessons, also visited factories or participated in production labor in conjunction with the content of the courses they were preparing. This not only quickly familiarized them with professional knowledge but also strengthened the connection between theory and practice. Although teacher Wu Weixin understood the calculation formula for the spiral distance of hairsprings as taught in textbooks, he did not understand how to calculate and apply it during manufacturing, and the textbooks did not have such materials. After visiting the Shanghai Hairspring Factory, the problem was easily solved.

    从工厂取经
    上海交通大学新设的精密仪器专业，在上海有关工业部门的协助下，迅速成长起来。
    去年生产大跃进中，交通大学根据上海工业部门向高级、大型、精密、尖端方向发展的需要，设置了这个新专业。为着更快地为生产部门培养专业技术人材，第一批四十六名学生，都是从别的专业调过来的，从三年级开始学习。这就要求专业的师资、设备迅速赶上。可是，新的教研组的七个教师大多是青年人，缺乏这门专业知识。但是，他们埋头苦干，在学校和有关业务部门的指导和帮助下，修订了教学计划，包下了一年到两年内开出七门专业课程的任务，还亲自做成了七台摩擦力距测定器。
    他们所以能够取得上述成就，主要是利用上海许多生产精密器械的工厂的有利条件，教师们一面自修备课，一面结合所备课程的内容，去工厂参观或参加生产劳动。这样不仅很快熟悉了专业知识，而且加强了理论与实际的联系。教师吴位新虽对于书本上所讲游丝的环状距离的计算公式有所理解，但不明了制造时怎样计算运用，书本上也没有这样的材料。他参观上海游丝厂后，问题便很容易地解决了。
