Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 15th. A large-scale, modern cement plant built in Jiangyou, Sichuan, was put into production ahead of schedule on November 11th.

The Jiangyou Cement Plant was built with the help of the German Democratic Republic. It is large in scale and technologically complex. The entire production process and transportation system, from ore mining to finished product delivery, are highly automated and mechanized. The high-grade cement produced by this plant will play a significant role in supporting the construction of the entire country and the southwest region.

The main production plant buildings were started in April 1958, with the original plan to be completed and put into production in July 1960. However, under the leadership of the factory Party committee, the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee, and the Mianyang Prefectural Committee, the policy of combining centralized leadership with vigorous mass movements was resolutely implemented. Continuous efforts were made to combat Rightist tendencies, boost morale, and launch a production increase and economy campaign centered on speed and quality. This greatly accelerated the construction speed, shortening the actual construction period by more than eight months compared to the original plan, and saving the state more than 10 million yuan in construction funds. The construction workers used scrap materials to make a large number of advanced construction machines such as electric welding machines, pipe cutting machines, cranes, and earthmoving machines, generally increasing work efficiency by more than three times. During the construction process, they also built a native cement plant, fifteen lime kilns, and three brick and tile factories, self-producing building materials to meet construction needs.

    江油水泥厂投入生产
    新华社成都15日电　在四川江油建设的一座大型现代化的水泥厂，已经提前在11月11日投入生产。
    江油水泥厂是由德意志民主共和国帮助我国建设的，它的规模宏大，技术复杂，全厂从矿石开采到成品出厂，整个生产工艺过程和全部运输系统，都是高度自动化和机械化的。这个厂生产的高标号水泥，对支援全国和西南地区的建设，将起很大的作用。
    这个厂的主要生产厂房是在1958年4月动工兴建的，原计划在1960年7月建成投入生产。由于工厂党委在中共四川省委和绵阳地委的领导下，坚决贯彻集中领导与大搞群众运动相结合的方针，不断反右倾，鼓干劲，开展以快速优质为中心的增产节约运动，因而大大加快了建设速度，使实际工期比原订工期缩短了八个多月，并且为国家节约了一千多万元的建设资金。建厂职工用废旧器材制出了电焊机、切管机、起重机、运土机等大批先进施工机械，一般都提高工效三倍以上。在建厂过程中，他们还建设了一座土法水泥厂、十五座石灰窑和三座砖瓦厂，自造建筑材料，满足施工需要。
