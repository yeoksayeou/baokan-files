Visiting the Advanced Fiberglass Factory
By our reporter Wang Hongren

Recently, we visited Shanghai Yaohua Glass Factory, China's first factory producing advanced fiberglass.

This factory was built last year with Soviet assistance, using the Great Leap Forward's pace, in just over eight months. It currently produces more than twenty varieties. The advanced fiberglass is spun into yarn and woven into cloth, tape, tubes, etc., which can be used as the best insulation base material for the electrical manufacturing industry. Generally, generators insulated with yarn-wrapped wires can only operate at a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius. If the temperature exceeds 100 degrees Celsius, it will be burned by the current. Fiberglass, however, has the characteristics of high-temperature resistance and non-conductivity. Motors using it as an insulating material can operate at high temperatures of 130 to 180 degrees Celsius. If it is combined with silicone organic resin, this fiberglass can withstand temperatures above 400 degrees Celsius. Therefore, large generators of 400,000 to 500,000 kilowatts and micro-motors cannot do without it. When this advanced fiberglass is drawn to three to four microns, its strength is ten times greater than that of steel wire. When mixed with plastic to form fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP), it is 75% lighter than steel. Stepping into the drawing workshop, the glass filaments under the neatly arranged platinum crucibles shimmer with silver light. Its fineness is equivalent to one-tenth of a human hair. Such fine glass filaments require extreme uniformity. Initially, every two workers could only watch over one crucible, drawing only 400 meters of filaments per minute. In February of this year, the workers launched a vigorous technical revolution, improving their operating techniques to the point where one person could watch over one crucible and still draw 3,000 meters of filaments. Cai Fubao, a 19-year-old female worker who joined the factory in January of this year, has now become a pioneer of technical innovation in the entire factory, able to watch over two platinum crucibles by herself. Her advanced operating methods are being promoted throughout the workshop.

In people's imagination, glass filaments must be brittle and hard, easily shattered. In fact, advanced fiberglass is both soft and strong in tensile strength. The plying and twisting workshop and the weaving workshop in this factory use it to weave cloth. This new factory, only established last year, has already trained more than 300 people, including workshop directors, technicians, and skilled workers, for fiberglass factories under construction across the country. It is truly a case of one tree blooming and bearing fruit everywhere. People can foresee that China's advanced fiberglass industry will soon usher in a thriving new era.

### 访高级玻璃纤维厂

    访高级玻璃纤维厂
    本报记者　王洪仁
    最近，我们参观了我国第一座生产高级玻璃纤维的工厂——上海耀华玻璃厂。
    这座工厂是去年在苏联援助下，用大跃进的步伐，在八个多月时间内建成的。目前它生产二十多种品种。用这种高级玻璃纤维纺成纱，织成布、带、管等，可以作为电气制造工业最好的绝缘基础材料。一般用纱包线绝缘的发电机只能在温度摄氏七十度下进行工作，温度如超过一百度后，就要被电流烧坏。玻璃丝却有耐高温、不导电的特点，用它作绝缘材料的马达可在摄氏一百三十到一百八十度的高温下进行工作；如果与硅有机树脂配合上，这种玻璃纤维能耐摄氏四百度以上的高温。所以，四十万到五十万瓩的大型发电机和微型电机就离不开它。把这种高级玻璃纤维拉到三至四微米，它的强度比钢丝大十倍，与塑料混合做成玻璃钢，比钢轻75％。踏进拉丝车间，一台一台排列整齐的白金坩锅下的玻璃丝银光闪闪，它的细度相等于一根头发十几分之一。这样细微的玻璃丝，要求十分均匀。开始，每两个工人只能看守一台坩锅，一分钟只拉丝四百米，今年2月份，工人们大闹技术革命提高了操作技术，做到一人看守一台坩锅，还能拉丝三千米。十九岁的女工蔡富宝今年1月份刚进厂，现在已成为全厂技术革新的闯将，一个人能看守二台白金坩锅。全车间已在推广她的先进操作方法。
    在人们的设想中，玻璃丝一定是又脆又硬，一触即碎。其实，高级玻璃丝的质地既柔软，拉力又强，这个厂的并捻车间和纺织车间就用它来织布。这个去年才建立的新厂，已为各地正在兴建的玻璃纤维厂培训出车间主任、技术员、技工等三百多人。真是一树开花，遍地结果。人们可以预料，我国高级玻璃纤维的工业，不久将出现一个欣欣向荣的新局面。
