Dongxiang County Relies on the Masses to Expand Irrigated Area by 160,000 Mu Last Winter and This Spring

This Year's Total Grain Output Increased by 40% Compared to Last Year, Unit Yield Increased by 50%

    According to news from the Jiangxi Daily, Dongxiang County has largely escaped the threat of severe drought due to large-scale water conservancy projects, which have enabled 70% of its farmland to achieve gravity irrigation. This year, the total grain output of the county increased by more than 40% compared to last year, and the unit yield increased by 50%. This is truly a major achievement.

    Before liberation, agricultural production was extremely low due to years of drought and flood disasters. The total grain output of the county was only 91.8 million jin, with an average yield of 180 jin per mu. The most fundamental reason for the severe disasters and low yields, in addition to the poor natural conditions, was the lack of water conservancy facilities. Before liberation, the county had only 18,000 flat ponds and 890 mountain ponds, plus small streams and ports, storing and diverting only 24 million cubic meters of water. Averaged over the county's more than 500,000 mu of land, this was only 50 cubic meters of water per mu, insufficient to withstand ten days of drought. Moreover, these existing water conservancy facilities were very scattered. At that time, only about 4% of the county's cultivated land had guaranteed harvests due to water, about 46% of the cultivated land had no water conservancy facilities, and the remaining 50% relied entirely on waterwheels for irrigation.

Harnessing Dragons Through Large-Scale Water Conservancy

    After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, Dongxiang County actively developed farmland water conservancy. From liberation to the spring of 1957, the county excavated a total of 1,543 mountain ponds and flat ponds, and built and repaired more than 770 dikes and dams, completing a cumulative total of 2 million cubic meters of earthwork, increasing water storage by 16 million cubic meters, and expanding the irrigated area by more than 100,000 mu. In the winter of 1957, based on the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, a large-scale upsurge in farmland water conservancy construction was launched. By the spring of 1958, the county had completed more than 2 million cubic meters of earthwork, equal to the total of all previous years combined; built the Xingfu (Happiness) Reservoir, which can irrigate 100,000 mu of farmland, and 77 small reservoirs, increasing water storage by 30 million cubic meters, reaching 75% of the total water storage of 40 million cubic meters in previous years, and expanding the irrigated area by more than 100,000 mu. Last winter and this spring, based on the victory of the people's commune movement, an even greater upsurge in water conservancy construction was launched. After a winter and spring of hard work, ten medium-sized reservoirs capable of irrigating more than 10,000 mu each were built (all of which have already benefited), and 32 small reservoirs with capacities of more than 1,000 mu but less than 10,000 mu were also built. The project completed 3.9 million cubic meters of water conservancy construction earthwork, increasing water storage by 80 million cubic meters, exceeding the total water conservancy achievements of previous years, including the results of the 1958 battle, and expanding the irrigated area by more than 165,000 mu.

    The achievements of water conservancy construction in Dongxiang County in recent years have been tremendous. At present, the county has a total of 22,535 various water conservancy projects, storing 150 million cubic meters of water, which can irrigate 380,000 mu of land. Among them, 70% of the cultivated land has achieved gravity irrigation, and 280,000 mu of paddy fields can remain drought-free for more than 80 days without rain, ensuring that a single rainfall of 140 mm will not cause disaster.

    With the construction of water conservancy, agricultural production has developed vigorously. This year, 320,000 mu of early rice in the county achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest. Among them, the average yield of early rice on 100,000 mu of low-yield fields doubled compared to last year, and the total output of early rice in the county increased by 28% compared to last year. Second-season late rice did not exist before liberation. After the completion of the Xingfu Reservoir in 1958, the county expanded the planting of second-season late rice by more than 60,000 mu. This year, the county expanded the planting of second-season late rice by more than 133,500 mu. Due to the improvement of water conservancy irrigation conditions, these late rice crops can be guaranteed to be planted and harvested. The total grain output of the county this year increased by 43% compared to last year, and the unit yield increased by 50%.

Implementing the "Three Main" Principles, Closely Combining Large, Medium, and Small

    One of the main experiences of Dongxiang County in carrying out large-scale water conservancy construction is the conscientious implementation of the principles of "mainly community-run, mainly water storage, mainly small-scale" and the close combination of large, medium, and small projects. Adhering to the approach of moving from points to areas, from small to large, from few to many, gradually exploring and accumulating experience, and then undertaking large-scale water conservancy projects capable of irrigating tens of thousands of mu when conditions are ripe. Closely combining large, medium, and small water conservancy projects, and combining new and old water conservancy projects to form a water conservancy network.

    In the early days after liberation, Dongxiang County mainly adopted the method of digging mountain ponds and opening flat ponds. After cooperativization, with the changes in production relations, small reservoirs were built, or water was diverted for irrigation by building river dams. With the realization of advanced cooperativization and the development of production, after 1956, the water conservancy construction in Dongxiang County took another major leap forward. The Dingjia Reservoir and the large Xingfu Reservoir, which irrigates 100,000 mu of land, were built successively. The completion of these two large and medium-sized reservoirs immediately demonstrated their great power. In the case of continuous drought for more than 120 days in 1958, the Xingfu Reservoir continuously released water for more than 120 days, persisting to the end to subdue the drought demon. The reservoir still had hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of water stored, effectively ensuring the two-season harvest of 100,000 mu of fields in the reservoir area. This fact clearly pointed out the path for hilly areas to eliminate water and drought disasters, and clearly pointed out that building large reservoirs on the mountainside, combined with the originally built mountain ponds and dikes, can better fully develop and utilize water resources. Last winter and this spring, the county laid out a total of ten projects above 10,000 mu and thirty-four projects above 1,000 mu but below 10,000 mu. Except for a few areas with poor conditions or good water sources, every people's commune held a 10,000-mu project, with 10,000-mu projects driving 1,000-mu projects, and medium and small projects being carried out simultaneously. After the completion of large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, many small water conservancy projects that were originally isolated and scattered can be supported by large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, greatly strengthening the ability to resist drought and flood.

Relying on the People's Communes, Launching Mass Movements on a Large Scale

    Last year's people's commune movement brought many benefits to large-scale water conservancy construction. Because the communes are large in scale and have a wide range of activities, this created favorable conditions for holding large and medium-sized water conservancy projects. In the past, the scale of advanced cooperatives was very small, and it was not possible to carry out a water conservancy project irrigating 10,000 mu; joint operations by several advanced cooperatives were also difficult due to inconsistent economic interests and difficulties in collaboration. The scope of a people's commune is very large, and it has already integrated the collective interests of many advanced cooperatives into a whole; and the people's commune has a large population and strength, and it will not have much impact to draw two or three thousand people to repair water conservancy; at the same time, the people's commune has also established public canteens and nurseries, liberating a large number of female laborers, adding a huge force to water conservancy construction. It is precisely because of the full play and utilization of these advantages of the people's commune, emphasizing the commune as a unit, and adopting the method of "comprehensive construction and point-by-point combat," that the water conservancy construction work last winter and this spring has been rapidly and comprehensively developed. For example, in Xiaohuang Commune, in the past, due to the small township and many cooperatives, the organization was dispersed, large-scale water conservancy could not be carried out, drought disasters were particularly serious, and water conservancy facilities have always been very poor. Last year, the people's commune was just established, and in one winter and spring, 780,000 cubic meters of earthwork were completed, completing two medium-sized reservoirs above 10,000 mu. After the reservoirs were built, canals were opened along the mountains, and all the paddy fields in the entire commune were surrounded by canals. How far the fields are, how far the canals are opened, so that every ridge of the commune can be irrigated. The great achievements of transforming nature can only be achieved by relying on the people's communes and giving full play to and utilizing the great advantages of the people's communes.

    The water conservancy construction last winter and this spring proved that the more difficult and critical the moment, the more necessary it is to adhere to putting politics in command, do a good job in political and ideological work, fully rely on and mobilize the masses, and launch mass movements on a large scale. When the ten 10,000-mu projects in the county were fully started, facing difficulties such as lack of equipment, lack of funds, and lack of technical forces, some commune cadres wavered and believed that: the masses can only use indigenous methods, can only overcome small difficulties, indigenous methods cannot achieve big things, and relying on the masses cannot overcome big difficulties. So they called and wrote reports, requesting the county to allocate steel bars, cement, and a large number of wood materials; some retreated in the face of difficulties and simply dismounted. In response to this situation, the county party committee immediately launched a mass debate throughout the county, and at the same time proposed to engage in the "Nine Self" movement (steel bars are refined by oneself, cement is made by oneself, lime is burned by oneself, wood is cut by oneself, stones are mined by oneself, funds are raised by oneself, hoists are made by oneself, technicians are trained by oneself, and tools are reformed by oneself). After airing opinions and debates, the idea of relying on the masses was established, and the "Nine Self" movement was launched. In a very short period of time, the masses burned 120 tons of cement, 500,000 jin of lime, 20,000 jin of crude saltpeter, 3,700 pieces of pottery tiles, donated scrap iron to refine 3 tons of indigenous steel, made 32 hoists, self-cut and self-made and donated 1,500 cubic meters of various wood materials, trained 300 peasant technicians, and raised 420,000 yuan of funds. The masses used these materials that they manufactured or donated, and used indigenous methods to build culverts, erect flumes, make inverted siphons, and split mountains and fill rivers. The heroic feat was truly unprecedented. The Hengshan Reservoir has a west main canal, which is 30 li long and can irrigate 7,000 mu of land after it is opened. But it is necessary to pass through three mountains and three ditches, one of which is a low-lying area 350 meters long, where the wooden flume that had just been erected was blown down by the wind. If the flume cannot be repaired, an inverted siphon must be made to pressurize the water over the hill. But without steel bars and cement, how can an inverted siphon be made? In the face of this difficulty, what should be done? Abandon this canal? The 7,000 mu of farmland on the other side of the mountain will not be irrigated; if the canal line is changed, it will inevitably be necessary to make a flume, and it will be necessary to increase 40,000 to 50,000 cubic meters of earthwork, and this year it will not be able to benefit. Comrade Chen Jiefu, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, who was guiding the reservoir construction work there, repeatedly studied and discussed with cadres, technicians, and migrant workers. The masses came up with ideas and suggestions, and finally came up with a way to use wooden inverted siphons instead of reinforced concrete, and made more than 180 sections of wooden inverted siphons, which were tightly sealed, airtight, and watertight, and pressurized the water to the hillside, so that the 7,000 mu of paddy fields on the other side of the mountain were irrigated. As a result, the early rice there had a bumper harvest, and the second-season late rice was also planted.

    Through the large-scale mass movement, many difficulties that were originally considered insurmountable were overcome one by one. In terms of labor, the county used 1.2 million labor days for water conservancy last winter and this spring, accounting for 9.5% of the county's possible attendance labor days; in terms of funding, the water conservancy construction cost 1.67 million yuan last winter and this spring, of which the state investment was only 150,000 yuan, accounting for 9% of the total cost, while more than 90% of the funds were solved by the people's communes; equipment was used even more sparingly, with a total of 120 tons of cement and 15 tons of steel used for ten 10,000-mu projects. If the work done in one winter and spring is compared with the past, it will be even more amazing! 3.9 million cubic meters of earthwork, according to the work efficiency in 1953, required 30,000 people to work for one year and two and a half months; according to the work efficiency in 1957, it also required 25,000 people to work for half a year; but last winter and this spring, only 14,000 people worked for four months. The ten 10,000-mu projects required 850 tons of cement in 1953 and 1,200 tons in 1957, while only 120 tons of cement were used last winter and this spring. The cost was 21 yuan per mu in 1953 and 17 yuan in 1957, while the average was only 12 yuan per mu last winter and this spring.

    The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee attaches great importance to the experience of Dongxiang County in water management and called on rural work cadres throughout the province to earnestly study the experience of Dongxiang County and push the water conservancy construction movement to a new climax.

    江西水利战线的一面旗帜
    东乡县依靠群众自力更生去冬今春扩大灌溉面积十六万亩
    今年全县粮食总产量比去年增加四成单位产量提高五成
    据江西日报消息　东乡县由于经过大办水利，使70％的农田实现了自流灌溉，基本摆脱了严重干旱的威胁。今年全县粮食总产量比去年增产四成多，单位产量增加五成。这真是一件大事。
    解放前由于旱涝灾害的连年袭击，农业产量极低，全县粮食总产量只有九千一百八十万斤，平均亩产一百八十斤。造成严重灾害和低产的原因，除了自然条件较差以外，最根本的原因，是由于水利设施不足。解放前全县只有一万八千口平塘和八百九十个山塘，加上小溪小港，蓄水引水不过二千四百万方，按全县五十多万亩地平均计算，每亩只有五十方水，不足抗击十天干旱。而且这些旧有的水利设施，又是非常分散的，当时全县只有4％左右的耕地有水保收，46％左右的耕地没有水利设施，其余的50％左右全靠车水灌溉。
    大兴水利锁蛟龙
    解放后，东乡县在党的正确领导下，积极兴办农田水利。从解放起到1957年春，全县共计开挖山塘、平塘一千五百四十三口，新建、修补陂坝七百七十多座，累计完成二百万土方，增加蓄水量一千六百万方，扩大灌溉面积十万多亩。1957年冬季，在农业合作化高潮的基础上，掀起了大规模的农田水利建设高潮，到1958年春全县完成了二百多万土方，等于历年累计完成土方的总和；建成了一座可灌十万亩农田的幸福水库和七十七座小型水库，增加蓄水量三千万公方，达到历年蓄水量总和四千万公方的75％，扩大灌溉面积十万多亩。去冬今春，又在人民公社化运动的胜利基础上，掀起了更大的水利建设高潮。经过一个冬春的苦战，兴建了十座万亩以上的中型水库（个个都已受益），同时还建成了三十二座万亩以下千亩以上的小型水库，完成水利建设土方三百九十万方，增加蓄水量八千万方，超过了包括1958年战果在内的历年水利成就的总和，扩大灌溉面积十六万五千多亩。
    东乡县近几年来水利建设的成就是巨大的。目前全县共有各种水利工程二万二千五百三十五座，蓄水一亿五千万方，可以灌溉三十八万亩田，其中有70％的耕地得到了自流灌溉，有二十八万亩水田可以保持八十天以上无雨不旱，保证一次降雨一百四十毫米不成灾。
    水利修起来了，农业生产得到蓬勃发展。今年全县有三十二万亩早稻，获得了全面大丰收。其中有十万亩低产田比去年早稻平均产量翻了一番，全县早稻总产量比去年增加28％。二季晚稻是解放前没有的，1958年幸福水库建成后，全县扩种二季晚稻六万多亩，今年全县又扩种二季晚稻十三万三千五百多亩。由于水利灌溉条件的改善，这些晚稻都可保种保收。全县今年粮食总产量，比去年增产43％，单位产量增长50％。
    贯彻“三主”方针，大中小紧密结合
    东乡县进行大规模水利建设的主要经验之一，就是认真地贯彻执行了社办为主、蓄水为主、小型为主和大中小相结合的方针。坚持由点到面，由小到大，由少到多，逐步摸索积累经验，条件成熟，再大办能灌溉万亩的水利工程。把大、中、小型水利工程紧密结合起来，把新老水利工程结合起来，连成一个水利网。
    解放初期，东乡县基本上是采取挖山塘、开平塘的办法。合作化以后，随着生产关系的变革，修建小型水库，或用拦河扎坝的方法，引水灌溉。随着高级合作化的实现和生产的发展，1956年以后，东乡县的水利建设又大大向前跃进了一步。先后兴建了灌田万亩的丁家水库和灌田十万亩的大型幸福水库，这两座大、中型水库的建成，立即显示了巨大的威力。在1958年干旱连续一百二十多天的情况下，幸福水库连续放水一百二十多天，一直坚持到最后把旱魔降服了，库内还存有几十万方水，有效地保证了库区十万亩田两季丰收。这个事实明确地指出了丘陵地区消灭水旱灾害的道路，明确地指出了在山腰上建大水库，与原来兴建的山塘陂坝联系起来，就能更好的充分开发和利用水利资源。去冬今春全县共铺开万亩以上工程十座，万亩以下千亩以上工程三十四座。除少数条件较差或水源较好的地区外，每一个人民公社，都举办了一座万亩工程，以万亩带千亩，中型小型同时并举。大、中型水利工程建成以后，原来孤立分散的许多小型水利工程，就可得到大、中型水利工程的支持，大大地加强了抗旱防洪能力。
    依靠人民公社，大搞群众运动
    去年的人民公社化运动，给大规模的水利建设带来了许多好处。由于公社规模大，活动范围广，这就给举办大、中型水利工程创造了有利条件。过去高级社的规模很小，搞一个灌溉万亩的水利工程，就没有那么大的力量；几个高级社合办，又因为经济利益不一致，协作有困难。一个人民公社的范围很大，它已经把许多个高级社的集体利益融成为一个整体；并且人民公社人多势众，抽二、三千人修水利不会有什么影响；同时，人民公社又办起来了公共食堂和托儿所，解放了大批妇女劳动力，给兴修水利增加了一支巨大的力量。正是由于充分发挥和运用了人民公社的这些优越性，强调以公社为单位，采取“全面兴修，分点作战”的办法，使去冬今春的水利建设工作，得到了迅速全面的发展。例如小璜公社，过去由于乡小社多，组织分散，总是搞不起来大水利，旱灾特别严重，水利设施一向很差。去年人民公社刚刚建立，一个冬春就干了七十八万土方，完成了两个万亩以上的中型水库。水库修成后，又沿山开渠，把全公社的水田，都包围在渠道中间，田有多远，渠道就开多远，使公社的每一个田垅都能灌到水。改造自然的伟大业绩，只有在依靠人民公社，充分发挥和运用人民公社的巨大优越性的情况下，才能办到。
    去冬今春水利建设证明：越是在困难的紧要关头，越要坚持政治挂帅，做好政治思想工作，充分依靠和发动群众，大搞群众运动。当全县十个万亩工程全面开工以后，面临着缺器材、缺资金、缺少技术力量的困难，有些公社干部就发生了动摇，认为：群众只能用土办法，只能克服小困难，土办法成不了大事情，依靠群众克服不了大困难。于是他们打电话、写报告，要求县里拨给钢筋、水泥和大批木料；有的便畏难而退，干脆下了马。县委针对这一情况，立即在全县范围内开展了群众性的大辩论，同时提出搞“九自”运动（钢筋自己炼、水泥自己制、石灰自己烧、木材自己砍、石头自己开、资金自己筹、启闭机自己造、技术人员自培养、工具自改革）。经过鸣放辩论，依靠群众的思想树立了，“九自”运动开展起来了。群众在非常短的时间内，烧制水泥一百二十吨，石灰五十万斤，土硝二万斤，陶器瓦罐三千七百个，捐献废铁炼出土钢三吨，制成三十二台启闭机，自砍自造和捐献各种木材一千五百立方米，培养农民技术员三百人，筹集资金四十二万元。群众将自己制造或捐献出来的这些材料，又用土办法砌涵管、架渡槽、制倒虹管、劈山填河。那种英雄创举，真是史无前例。横山水库有一条西干渠，长达三十华里，开通后可灌田七千亩。但是要过三座山、三道沟，其中有一个洼地长三百五十米，那里刚架起来的木头渡槽，就被风刮倒了。渡槽修不成，必须制成倒虹管把水高压过岗。但是没有钢筋、水泥，怎样做得起来倒虹管呢？在这个困难面前，又该怎么办？放弃这条渠道不搞？山那边的七千亩农田就不能得到灌溉；要是改变渠道线，也少不了要做渡槽，而且需要增加四、五万土方，今年受不到益。在那里指导修水库工作的县委副书记陈接福同志，反复与干部、技术人员以及民工群众研究商量。群众都来献计献策，终于想出了用木制倒虹管来代替钢筋水泥的办法，并且把一百八十多节的木制倒虹管做起来了，密合得不透风，不漏水，把水压上了山岗，使山那边的七千亩水田得到了灌溉。结果，那里的早稻丰收了，还插上了二季晚稻。
    经过大搞群众运动，原来认为不可克服的许多困难，一个个地都克服了。在劳动力方面，全县去冬今春修水利实用劳动日一百二十万个，占全县可能出勤劳动日的9.5％；在经费方面，去冬今春的水利建设费用共计一百六十七万元，其中国家投资只有十五万元，占全部费用的9％，而90％以上的经费是由人民公社解决；器材用得更加节省，十座万亩工程共用水泥一百二十吨，钢材十五吨。如果将一个冬春所做的工作和过去比较起来，就显得更加惊奇了！三百九十万土方，按1953年的工效，需用三万人作工一年零二个半月；按1957年的工效，也需二万五千人作半年；可是去冬今春只一万四千人作工四个月。十座万亩工程，在1953年需用水泥八百五十吨，1957年需一千二百吨，而去冬今春只用水泥一百二十吨。造价1953年每亩负担二十一元，1957年为十七元，去冬今春平均每亩只十二元。
    江西省委十分重视东乡县治水的经验，号召全省农村工作干部认真学习东乡县的经验，把水利建设运动推向新高潮。
