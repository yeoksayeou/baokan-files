Launch Mass Movements, Master Cutting-Edge Technology
—The Experience of Changchun First Automobile Factory in Manufacturing Red Flag Luxury Sedans

After only nine months of production preparation, the Red Flag luxury sedan has begun mass production at the Changchun First Automobile Factory. This is a victory for launching mass movements and a victory for vigorously promoting technological innovation and revolution.

The production preparation for the Red Flag sedan, including the design and trial production of the entire vehicle (with 3,488 parts), the design and manufacture of equipment and tooling, and the adjustment of tooling and parts assembly, involved a large workload. Many cutting-edge technologies were new challenges for Chinese workers and technicians. If the old methods were followed, it would be difficult to produce a car in three years. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the workers of the Changchun First Automobile Factory thoroughly criticized the right-leaning thought that cutting-edge technology could not involve mass movements, launched mass movements to vigorously promote technological innovation and revolution, and widely absorbed workers to participate in design, which accelerated the design speed and improved the design quality, creating favorable conditions for manufacturing work. Nearly 10,000 people in the factory were involved in the activities of manufacturing equipment and tooling. During the adjustment of tooling, a large number of technical difficulties were overcome, and the wave of mass movements and technological innovation rose one after another, each higher than the last.

Workers Participate in Design Quickly and Well

During the production preparation period, the workers of the Changchun First Automobile Factory actively participated in mass design movements. Technicians and workers worked side by side, ensuring the high-speed completion of product and tooling design, with good quality.

In the past, design work was only undertaken by a small number of designers. After the design drawings were produced, they were handed over to workers to manufacture accordingly. Last year, many workers at the First Automobile Factory participated in factory design and product design and achieved great success. However, some people still doubted whether workers could systematically participate in product design and key tooling design. In the production preparation work for the Red Flag sedan, workers widely participated in product and tooling design, and were not limited to providing opinions. In some designs, they directly produced drawings.

Workers' participation in product design was mainly carried out through trial production work. After the designers put forward preliminary drawings, they were directly handed over to production workers for trial production, changing the practice of trial production only by one trial production unit. In this way, the entire factory became a design department, and each production line became a professional design group. Workers and designers worked together, trial-producing and researching the design at the same time. When problems were discovered, small problems were discussed by a few people, and major problems were debated on a large scale, and finally the design department made a decision. This could timely discover and solve many problems, greatly improving the design quality.

After workers participated in product design, it was much easier for them to participate in the design of tooling for manufacturing products. General tooling design involved widespread mass discussion and participation. Key tooling design concentrated superior forces to overcome difficulties. For example, large and medium-sized stamping dies for stamping car bodies, which most designers did not dare to design in the past, this time organized a "three-in-one" design team with a large number of workers participating, achieving inspiring results. For example, one design group completed the design of 174 sets of stamping dies in only ten days. If only the 17 designers in the entire workshop had designed them, it would have taken at least 35 days. They also made many structural improvements, improved design quality, and only one major error was found in so many drawings.

"Three-in-One" Overcomes Production Difficulties

In the production preparation and production process of the Red Flag sedan, many difficulties were encountered, some caused by excessive workload, and some caused by technical complexity. They were all overcome one by one by the "three-in-one" mass line working method. The equipment and tooling required for the production of the Red Flag sedan had to be manufactured within four months, but its workload exceeded the then possible manufacturing capacity of the entire factory by more than three times. Because the factory's Party Committee mobilized the masses to find ways, an unexpected situation quickly emerged. The casting capacity of tooling castings was tripled by changing the labor organization, first breaking through the factory's "bottleneck." Fitters were the most strained workers at the time, with a large amount of work pressing on them. Some people have always believed that fitters cannot engage in technological innovation, and they mainly rely on craftsmanship. The fitters launched a movement to mechanize tools, increasing production capacity several times. In particular, sheet metal workers used the "three-ization" method of process-ization, fixture-ization, and mechanization, completely changing the face of this type of work, increasing production efficiency by more than ten times, improving quality to the level where parts could be interchanged, and most of the work could be undertaken by apprentices.

In the test driving and adjustment, due to lack of experience and lack of data, many complex technical problems were encountered that could not be figured out for a while, including cutting-edge technologies such as high-speed bearing shells, high-pressure oil pumps, hydraulic tappets, precision forging, precision casting, and silent gears. The factory adopted the following method: general problems were solved by the masses through division of labor and responsibility; key problems were solved by concentrating the factory's superior forces. The factory extracted experienced leading cadres, experienced technicians, and experienced workers to form 291 "three-in-one" shock teams. Under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, they carried out combat-oriented research work with a combination of virtual and real methods. In less than two months, the problems were basically solved. In solving these problems, various professional technicians and workers truly combined theory with practice, various different professions cooperated, and enthusiasm was combined with scientific analysis, so that many very difficult problems were satisfactorily solved. Hydraulic tappets, some foreign magazines still often discuss its quality problems. The first tappets made by the First Automobile Factory could only support work for a few hours on the test bench. After repeated tests, they finally stably passed the 400-hour bench test. The shock team wrote the results of their work into a paper, which was greatly praised by Soviet experts. So far, the factory has written 42 similar papers. Through mass revolutionary and creative activities, it can now be said that we have basically mastered the mysteries of luxury cars.

Several Good Organizational Forms

In the process of launching mass movements and vigorously promoting technological innovation and revolution, the First Automobile Factory used many effective organizational forms, which played an important role in strengthening Party leadership and promoting the widespread and in-depth development of mass movements.

In implementing the Party's policies and strengthening unified planning, the First Automobile Factory's employee representative conferences, five-level cadre conferences, and "three-in-one" activist conferences played a very important role. Their characteristics are that they can quickly reflect the opinions of the masses and the requirements of various departments, and enable the Party's intentions to directly meet the masses, making it easy to quickly mobilize the masses and organize the coordinated actions of all parties.

The "three-in-one" shock team broke through all the technical difficulties and the very large amount of work of the topics it was responsible for. The reason is that it was composed of leading cadres, technicians, workers, including the most active and experienced people in various different professions and types of work, and effectively brought into play the power of the combination of technicians and the masses of workers, and the close cooperation of various professions. More importantly, the vitality of the shock team lies in the fact that under the direct leadership of the Party, it implemented the principle of putting politics in command and working with a combination of virtual and real principles. The shock team always maintained vigorous morale and a pragmatic and scientific working method, truly embodying the principles of combining politics and economics, combining theory and practice, and combining centralized management and mass movements.

The "Great Battle" is an organizational form that appeared in the later stage of the Red Flag sedan's campaign to put it into mass production, in which various tasks leaped forward in an all-round way. After the production preparation work was completed, the production capacity on the various production fronts was very inconsistent, and the various production conditions were also uneven. How can we make the backward catch up with the advanced and develop in an all-round way? The factory first arranged various tasks in a certain position through a mass planning activity to offer gifts to the National Day; then launched a mass competition to realize the plan. The workers chased after each other to see who could first meet the requirements of the assembly line and who could first complete the tasks in the plan; at the same time, they organized a mass self-examination (employee representative delegation and youth supervision post). These were the three components of the "Great Battle" at that time. The slogans and actions of the "Great Battle" were deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, with great momentum, wide scope, comprehensive work, and were a positive way to carry out work in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

The "Shock Team" focuses on key points, and the "Great Battle" tackles all aspects. The combination of the two resulted in a situation where everyone made contributions and offered gifts before the National Day, and a comprehensive Great Leap Forward. As a result, the entire task was completed ahead of schedule, exceeding the quota and in an all-round way. The Red Flag luxury sedan was put into mass production according to the predetermined plan.

    大搞群众运动　掌握尖端技术
    ——长春第一汽车厂制造红旗牌高级轿车的经验
    红旗牌高级轿车经过短短九个月的生产准备，已经由长春第一汽车制造厂开始成批生产了。这是大搞群众运动的胜利，大闹技术革新和技术革命的胜利。
    红旗牌轿车的生产准备工作，包括整车设计和试制（全车有零件三千四百八十八个），设备和工艺装备的设计与制造，调整工艺装备和零件总成等，工作量很大；有许多尖端技术，对于我国工人和技术人员都是新的课题。如果按照老办法行事，三年也难出车。长春第一汽车厂的职工在党委领导下，彻底批判了尖端技术不能大搞群众运动的右倾思想，发动群众大闹技术革新和技术革命，广泛吸收工人参加设计，结果加快了设计速度，提高了设计质量，为制造工作创造了良好条件；全厂将近一万人卷进了制造设备和工艺装备的活动；调整工艺装备期间攻破了大量技术难关，群众运动和技术革新的浪潮一个接着一个，一个比一个高涨。
    工人参加设计又快又好
    在生产准备期间，长春第一汽车厂的工人积极参加了群众性的设计运动。技术人员和工人并肩作战，保证了高速度地完成产品和工艺装备设计，而且质量良好。
    过去设计工作只由少数设计人员担负，设计出图以后，再交给工人照样制造。去年，第一汽车厂就有许多工人参加了工厂设计和产品设计，取得了很大的成就。但是还有人怀疑，工人是否能够系统地参加产品设计和关键性的工艺装备设计。在红旗牌轿车生产准备工作当中，工人广泛参加了产品和工艺装备设计，而且不仅限于提出意见，在一部分设计中还直接制出了图纸。
    工人参加产品设计，主要是通过试制工作进行的。设计人员把初步图纸提出之后，便直接交给生产工人试制，改变了仅由一个试制单位试制的作法。这样一来，全厂都成了设计部门，每个生产线成了各种专业设计组。工人同设计人员一起，一面试制，一面研究设计。发现问题以后，小问题少数人磋商，大问题便进行大规模的辩论，最后由设计部门定案。这就能及时发现和解决许多问题，大大提高了设计质量。
    工人参加产品设计以后，再来参加制造产品用的工艺装备设计，就方便得多了。一般性工艺装备设计，群众普遍讨论，普遍动手；关键性的工艺装备设计，则集中优势兵力突击。例如冲压车身用的大、中型冲模，过去一般的设计师都不大敢动手设计，这次组织了有大量工人参加的“三结合”设计队伍，取得了振奋人心的成就。例如其中一个设计组所作的一百七十四套冲模设计，只用了十天的时间，要是只靠全车间的十七个设计师设计，最快也要用三十五天。他们还作了许多结构上的改进，提高了设计质量，重大错误在这样多的图纸中只发现了一处。
    “三结合”连克生产难关
    在红旗牌轿车的生产准备和生产的过程中，遇到了许多困难，有的是因工作量过大而造成的，有的是因技术上过分复杂而造成的。它们都由“三结合”的群众路线的工作方法一一战胜了。生产红旗牌轿车需用的设备和工艺装备必须在四个月内制成，但是它的工作量却超过当时全厂可能参加制造的能力三倍以上。由于厂党委发动群众人人想办法，很快就出现了出人意料的局面。工艺装备铸件的铸造能力，由于改变了劳动组织，提高了三倍，首先打破了全厂的“瓶口”。钳工是当时最紧张的工种，大量的工作压在他们的手里。有些人一向认为钳工没法搞技术革新，他们主要是靠手艺。钳工们却开展了工具机械化的运动，数倍地提高了生产能力。尤其是钣金工用工序化、胎具化、机械化“三化”的办法，彻底改变了这个工种的面貌，生产效率提高了十几倍，质量提高到制件可以互换的水平，而且大部工作徒工可以担负。
    在试车和调整中因为缺乏经验，缺乏资料，碰到了许多一时摸不清头脑的复杂的技术问题，其中属于尖端技术的如高速轴瓦、高压油泵、液压挺杆、精密锻造、精密铸造、无声齿轮等。厂里采取了这样的办法：一般问题，群众分工负责解决；关键性的问题，集中全厂优势兵力集中解决。全厂抽出有经验的领导干部、有经验的技术人员、有经验的工人组成了二百九十一个“三结合”突击队，在各级党组织的领导下，以虚实并举的方法，开展了战斗性的研究工作，时间不到两个月，问题基本上解决了。在解决这些问题当中，各种专业的技术人员和工人，真正作到了理论与实践结合、各种不同专业协作、干劲与科学分析结合，使许多十分困难的问题得到了令人满意的解决。液压挺杆，现在一些外国杂志上还经常讨论它的质量问题。第一汽车厂最初作出来的挺杆，在试验台上只能支持工作几小时，经过反复试验，最后终于稳定地通过了四百小时的台上试验。突击队把工作的结果写成一篇论文，大受苏联专家赞许。到目前为止，全厂已写出类似的论文四十二篇。通过群众性的革命的创造活动，现在可以说，我们已经基本上掌握了高级轿车的奥秘。
    几种良好的组织形式
    第一汽车厂在大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新和技术革命的过程中，运用了许多行之有效的组织形式，对加强党的领导，推动群众运动广泛深入地发展起了重要作用。
    在贯彻党的方针和加强统一规划方面，第一汽车厂采用的职工代表会议、五级干部会议和“三结合”的活动分子会议很起作用。它们的特点是，既能很快地反映群众意见和各部门的要求，又能使党的意图直接同群众见面，便于迅速地发动群众，便于组织各方面的协同动作。
    “三结合”突击队，突破了它所负责的所有的技术难关和工作量特大的专题。原因是它是由领导干部、技职人员、工人，包括各种不同专业不同工种最积极最有经验的人组成的，切实地发挥了技术人员和工人群众结合的力量，各种专业密切合作的力量。更重要的，突击队的生命力在于在党的直接领导下，实行了政治挂帅，以虚实并举的原则进行工作。突击队总是保持着旺盛的士气和实事求是的科学的工作方法，真正体现了政治经济相结合，理论实际相结合，集中管理和群众运动相结合的原则。
    “大会战”，是红旗牌轿车投入成批生产运动后期出现的一种各种工作全面跃进的组织形式。生产准备工作完成以后，各个生产战线上的生产能力很不一致，各种生产条件也参差不齐，如何能使落后赶上先进全面发展呢？厂里首先是通过群众性的国庆节献礼规划，把各种工作安排在一定位置上；然后开展了群众性实现规划的比武活动，职工们你追我赶，看谁先满足装配线的要求，谁先完成规划中的任务；同时组织了群众性的自我检查（职工代表团和青年监督岗）。这是当时“大会战”的三个组成部分。“大会战”的口号和行动深入人心，声势浩大，范围广泛，工作全面，是多、快、好、省地进行工作的积极办法。
    “突击队”突重点，“大会战”攻全面，两者结合起来，出现了国庆节前人人立功，人人献礼，全面大跃进的局面。结果整个任务提前超额全面完成了，红旗牌高级轿车按预订计划投入了成批生产。
