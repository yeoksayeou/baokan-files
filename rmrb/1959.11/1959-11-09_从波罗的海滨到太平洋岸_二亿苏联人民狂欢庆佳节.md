Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 7th (TASS): Throughout the Soviet Union – from the Baltic coast to the Pacific shore – 208 million Soviet people today joyfully celebrated the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

    In the vast territory of the Soviet Union, the first to begin celebrating this national holiday was the Chukotka National District, separated from the American continent only by the Bering Strait. While the Chukchi people were donning their festive attire and holding traditional parades, the pre-holiday celebration meeting in Moscow had just concluded.

    While Muscovites were still soundly asleep, the citizens of Vladivostok began their parade in thousands of columns. Subsequently, the cities of the Far East and Siberia – Khabarovsk, Irkutsk, and Novosibirsk – also successively began their festive parades.

    Then, Moscow held a grand military parade and march-past, and millions of people listened with deep satisfaction to the speech delivered by Marshal Malinovsky during the Red Square parade, broadcasted by radio stations across the country. Mass parades were also held by the working people in the capitals of the fifteen republics, including Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Alma-Ata, Riga, Tbilisi, Tashkent, and many other cities across the country.

    In the evening, traditional festive artillery salutes were fired in Moscow, the capitals of the republics, and the heroic cities of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sevastopol, and Odessa. The working people everywhere were filled with festive joy. Evening parties, concerts, and other colorful festive activities were held in the streets and squares.
