Communes and Mechanization Unleash Infinite Power
Heilongjiang Province Achieves Another Comprehensive Bumper Harvest

(Our newspaper, Harbin, 31st dispatch) Heilongjiang Province, where agricultural machinery cultivation area has reached 20%, continued to achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest in the first year after the realization of people's communes. According to current actual measurements and estimations from various regions, although the sown area of ​​grain crops has decreased by 10% compared to last year due to the planned expansion of economic crops, the total grain output of the province will still increase by about 10% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. At the same time, due to the increased proportion of economic crops such as soybeans, and due to the development of diversified operations, the total output value of agricultural and sideline products in Heilongjiang Province this year will increase by more than 15% compared to last year.

This year, Heilongjiang Province experienced spring drought and summer floods. Especially during the spring plowing period, the whole province lacked rain. However, because mechanical cultivation can start sowing half a month earlier to seize soil moisture, and can save a large amount of labor to further implement the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, coupled with the enormous role played by the water conservancy projects built by the people's communes, not only did the general areas achieve a bumper harvest this year, but also the disaster-stricken areas achieved a bumper harvest; not only high-yield crops achieved a bumper harvest, but also so-called "low-yield crops" achieved a bumper harvest. In terms of diversified operations, the province's sideline income has already exceeded the same period last year by more than double, and large livestock, pigs, and poultry have increased by 8.7% to 80% respectively compared to last year. Beekeeping, silkworm rearing, fish farming, and fruit tree planting have spread to most of the people's communes in the province. The ideal of "bumper harvests of all grains and thriving livestock," which the vast number of peasants in Heilongjiang Province have yearned for for many years, has begun to become a reality.

One of the important reasons why Heilongjiang, a province with abundant land and a shortage of labor, has been able to achieve comprehensive bumper harvests year after year is that agricultural machinery has played a huge role. This year, the land cultivated with mechanized agricultural tools in Heilongjiang Province has reached 20%, plus the land cultivated with new-style animal-powered farm implements, reaching 50% of the province's cultivated land, which has greatly improved labor efficiency. Last year, in just two months from the end of the autumn harvest to before the ground froze, the province completed the emergency turning over of 60% of the cultivated land. As a result, in this year's spring plowing season, the phenomenon that a small part of the crops could not be sown in time due to the lack of labor allocation in previous years was changed. At the same time, mechanization and new-style animal-powered farm implements can be put into the ground as soon as the topsoil thaws two inches, while old farm implements have to wait until it thaws more than half a foot before sowing. Therefore, the large-scale use of mechanical cultivation this year has advanced the sowing period by half a month compared to previous years, reducing the threat of the severe spring drought. The fact that the total output of spring wheat increased by 30% compared to last year fully demonstrates the great power of agricultural mechanization.

The development of agricultural mechanization has further promoted the reform of tools in rural areas. The mechanical principles mastered by the masses in the use of mechanical cultivation have broadened the ideas for creating new tools and reformed old farm implements to meet the requirements of mechanical cultivation. At the end of October, the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute identified and selected twenty-six new machines, including a "weeding hoe" that can hoe thirty mu of land a day, and a "double-drum corn thresher" that can thresh six thousand catties per hour, and so on. The efficiency of agricultural production tools has been improved, saving a large amount of labor for field management and diversified operations. This year, from spring plowing to before the autumn harvest, a total of 9.6 million man-days and 4.8 million horse-days were saved in rural areas due to the use of machine cultivation and machine processing of grain. The rational organization of labor by the people's communes, coupled with the superiority of mechanization, has enabled agricultural production increase measures to be better implemented. The average fertilizer application per mu in the province this year is nearly 4,000 catties; the water conservancy irrigation area is 15 million mu; reasonable close planting has been promoted, and the number of plants per mu has increased by 10%-20%; the area using improved varieties has reached more than 70%. This was simply impossible in the past.

The people's communes have opened up broad avenues for the development of agricultural mechanization. Before communization, after seven years of development, there were only 1,648 standard units of tractors in rural Heilongjiang Province. In the year after communization, 1,207 standard units were added. This is because the commune's funds are much larger than those of the agricultural cooperatives, coupled with strong state support, making it possible for each commune to purchase tractors and other agricultural machinery. At the same time, the large scale of commune operations has created good conditions for mechanical farm implements suitable for large-scale production. In the Shulin Management Area of the Xingnong People's Commune in Baiquan County, in the days of the advanced cooperatives, because the plots were not large and the ridges were short, the tractors, when working, wasted 20% of the time idling due to turning around. After the establishment of the commune, land plots were merged according to local conditions, and the ridges were generally two to three li long, so that the efficiency of the use of tractors was more fully realized. In the days of celebrating consecutive comprehensive bumper harvests, two new folk songs created by farmers are popular in rural Heilongjiang: "The fields are golden, and the granaries are full of wheat. Where does the bumper harvest come from? All thanks to the Communist Party." From their personal experiences, the farmers have realized that the fundamental reason for the bumper harvest is the leadership of the Party.

The farmers of Heilongjiang Province are riding the waves and setting off a winter production upsurge to lay a solid foundation for continuing the comprehensive leap forward next year. By mid-October, more than 11.9 million mu of land had been cultivated in the province in autumn. Together with the wheat stubble and flax stubble land cultivated in summer, there are a total of 23.2 million mu, accounting for one-fifth of the province's total cultivated land. A total of more than 510 million catties of fine varieties of seeds were selected from the fields during the autumn harvest, and the selection of seeds is continuing on the threshing grounds. Water conservancy projects have been launched one after another in various places. The "small autumn harvest" movement, in which hundreds of thousands of people are participating, is being carried out vigorously in various places. People strongly feel that a new upsurge of winter production, larger in scale than any year before, will soon appear universally in all parts of Heilongjiang Province.

    公社化机械化发挥无穷威力
    黑龙江省农业再获全面大丰收
    本报哈尔滨31日电　农业机械耕作面积已达20％的黑龙江省，在实现人民公社化后的第一年，继续获得了全面大丰收。根据当前各地实测估算，虽然由于有计划地扩大了经济作物，粮食作物的播种面积比去年减少了10％，但是全省粮食总产量仍将比大跃进的1958年增长10％左右。同时，由于大豆等经济作物的比重增加，由于多种经营的发展，今年黑龙江省农副业总产值将比去年增长15％以上。
    今年黑龙江省春旱夏涝，特别是春耕期间全省缺雨，但是由于机械耕作可以提早半月抢墒播种，并且可以节省出大批人力，进一步贯彻农业八字宪法，加上人民公社兴修的水利工程发挥了巨大作用，因此，今年不但一般地区丰收，连受灾地区也丰收了；不但高产作物丰收，所谓“低产作物”也丰收了。在多种经营方面，目前全省副业收入已经超过去年同期一倍以上，大牲畜、猪、家禽分别比去年增加8.7％到80％。养蜂、养蚕、养鱼、种果树，遍及全省大部分人民公社。黑龙江省广大农民多年渴望的“五谷丰登，六畜兴旺”的理想开始成为现实。
    黑龙江这个地多劳动力少的省份能够连年全面丰收，重要原因之一是农业机械发挥了巨大作用。黑龙江省使用机械化农具耕作的土地今年已经达到20％，加上用新式畜力农具耕作的土地，达全省耕地的50％，这就大大地提高了劳动效率。去年，从秋收后到大地封冻前不过两个月的时间，全省就突击翻完了60％的耕地。这样一来，今年春耕季节里就改变了往年因为劳动力调配不过来而有一小部分庄稼不能适时播种的现象。同时，机械化和新式畜力农具只要地皮化冻两寸以后就可以下地，旧农具却要等化冻半尺以上才能播种，因此，今年大量使用机械耕作，就使播种期比往年提前半月，减轻了特大春旱的威胁。今年春小麦总产量比去年增加30％的事实，充分地说明了农业机械化的巨大威力。
    农业机械化的发展，进一步推动了农村的工具改革。群众在使用机械耕作中掌握的机械原理，扩大了创造新工具的思路，并且适应机械耕作的要求改革旧式农具。10月末，黑龙江省农业厅、农业机械化研究所经过鉴定选出了二十六种新机具，其中有一天锄地三十亩的“耘锄”，每小时脱粒六千斤的“双滚筒玉米脱粒机”，等等。农业生产工具的效率提高了，便节省出大量的劳动力投入田间管理和多种经营。今年从春耕到秋收前，农村由于使用机器耕作和机器加工粮食，共节约了九百六十万个人工和四百八十万个马工。人民公社合理组织劳动力，加上机械化的优越性，使农业增产措施得到更好的贯彻。全省今年每亩施肥平均近四千斤；水利灌溉面积一千五百万亩；推行了合理密植，每亩庄稼的株数增加10％—20％；采用良种的面积达70％以上。这是过去根本做不到的。
    人民公社为农业机械化的发展开辟了广阔的道路。公社化以前，经过七年的发展，黑龙江省农村只有拖拉机一千六百四十八个标准台，公社化后一年中就增加了一千二百零七个标准台。这是因为公社的资金雄厚大大超过了农业社，再加上国家的大力扶助，每个公社都开始有可能购置拖拉机和其他农用机器。同时，公社经营规模大，给适合大生产的机械农具创造了良好的条件。拜泉县兴农人民公社守林管理区，高级社时由于地块不大，地垅短，拖拉机干起活来，因转弯抹角而空运转的时间占20％。公社建成后，因地制宜，合并地块，地垅一般长两华里到三华里，拖拉机的使用效率得到较充分的发挥。在喜庆连年全面大丰收的日子里，黑龙江农村流行着两首农民创作的新歌谣：“大田金黄黄，小麦堆满仓。丰收哪里来？全靠共产党”。农民从切身的体验中认识到：大丰收的根本原因是党的领导。
    黑龙江全省农民正乘风破浪，掀起冬季生产高潮，为明年继续全面跃进打好基础。到10月中旬，全省已经秋耕土地一千一百九十多万亩，加上夏耕的麦茬地和亚麻茬地，共有两千三百二十万亩，占全省总耕地五分之一。秋收期间从田间选出的优良种子，共有五亿一千多万斤，现在正继续在场院上选种。各地水利工程已纷纷上马。几十万人参加的“小秋收”运动轰轰烈烈地在各地展开。人们强烈地感觉到，超过任何一年的更大规模的冬季生产新高潮，很快就要在黑龙江省各地普遍出现。
