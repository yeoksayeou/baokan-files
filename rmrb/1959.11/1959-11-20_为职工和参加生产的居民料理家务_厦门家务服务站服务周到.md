Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 19th: The "Household Service Stations" organized by street residents in Xiamen are enthusiastically serving workers and street women participating in production and work.

These household service stations were established to meet the increasing number of people participating in production and work on the streets since the Great Leap Forward in production. Since August, under the leadership of the Xiamen Municipal Street Party and government leading departments, the masses have established forty-six household service stations in various central areas. Each service station has also set up many service groups according to needs, providing services such as washing and ironing, mending clothes, renovating old items, washing bed sheets, buying things on behalf of people, delivering meals, ordering newspapers and magazines, buying theater tickets, etc., greatly reducing the household chores of workers and street residents participating in production and work. For example, when sugar factory worker Wang Jinhua was on maternity leave and lacked care because her husband also worked at the sugar factory, the personnel of the Gucheng Service Station took the initiative to make snacks and cook chicken and duck for her, taking careful care of her. The Longtou area service station in Gulangyu saw that many workers rushed across the sea to work in Xiamen early in the morning and did not have much time to go to the streets to buy vegetables and other non-staple foods. The service station specially set up a group to buy things on their behalf, buying non-staple foods and other things for them. Huang Xi, a construction worker, had a family of five, and all three adults participated in production. The service station personnel often bought vegetables and snacks for him and delivered them to his home before breakfast. The central canteen on Gongyuan Road has an attached service station, which washes and mends clothes for workers who board there and nearby residents. The workers gratefully said: The service station is really great.

The common characteristics of each service station are a wide range of services, speed, convenience, and low fees. The service personnel are all people with relatively high political awareness and collectivist ideology. Before the establishment of the stations, they had studied and realized the importance of running the service stations, so their service attitude was positive and enthusiastic. Now, an atmosphere of mutual care, mutual assistance, and everyone contributing to the leap forward in production has emerged between the service stations and the surrounding masses everywhere.

    为职工和参加生产的居民料理家务
    厦门家务服务站服务周到
    新华社福州19日电　厦门市街道居民举办的“家务服务站”，热心为职工和参加生产参加工作的街道妇女服务。
    这些家务服务站，是适应生产大跃进以来，街道上参加生产参加工作的人越来越多的情况而设立的。从8月份以来，厦门市街道党政领导部门领导群众在各中心区设立了四十六个家务服务站，各服务站还根据需要分设了许多服务小组，为人们洗烫、缝补衣服、改旧翻新、拆洗被单、代买东西、代送饭、代订书报、代买戏票等等，使职工和参加生产参加工作的街道居民减少很多家务事。例如糖厂工人王锦华因丈夫也在糖厂工作，在产假期间乏人照护，古城服务站的人员便主动替她做点心、煮鸡鸭，细心照顾。鼓浪屿龙头地区服务站看到很多工人一清早就赶过海到厦门去上班，上街买菜点等副食品的时间不多，服务站就专门设了一个代买东西的小组，替他们代买副食品和其他东西。建筑工人黄锡一家五口人，三个大人全部参加生产，服务站人员就经常替他买菜点，在早饭前送到他家里。公园路的中心食堂附设了服务站，为寄膳的工人和附近居民洗补衣服等，工人们都感激地说：服务站真是太好了。
    各服务站的共同特点是服务范围广、快、方便，收费又较低。服务人员都是由政治觉悟比较高，具有集体主义思想的人担任。在建站前，他们曾进行了学习，认识到举办服务站的重要意义，因而服务态度积极热情。现在，在服务站和周围群众之间，处处出现了互相关心、互相照顾、人人都为生产跃进出力的气氛。
