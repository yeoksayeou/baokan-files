    An Exhibition Closely Related to the People's Lives
    ——After Viewing the National Arts and Crafts Exhibition
  　Lei Guiyuan
    The beautiful artworks in this National Arts and Crafts Exhibition are the artistic reflections of our rich and colorful lives by the older generation of artists, young artists, and teachers and students of arts and crafts schools from all provinces and cities across the country, under the situation of the Great Leap Forward. They are their creative labor as a gift to the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland.
    If these works could speak, it would be a beautiful movement, and its theme would be to hail the victory of socialism!
    From the works displayed here, one can see the authors' patriotic and socialist thoughts and sincere and simple feelings. Through these works, one can deeply appreciate that many arts and crafts workers, from elderly artists in their seventies and eighties to apprentices in their teens, have the desire to go all out, aim high, and contribute their energy unreservedly to the country and the people. Even if their skills are not yet very mature, they always want to express the fresh things they see and feel, using material means, even if it is a blade of grass or a piece of mud. They try their best to express it, praising the Party, praising the Great Leap Forward, praising the General Line, praising the People's Communes. They always want to shape many new things into beautiful artworks with beautiful images and colors, to be widely spread, known to every household, and deeply rooted in people's hearts.
    When we enter the gate of the exhibition hall, we will have a feeling of openness and simplicity, but also of richness and color. In terms of layout, classification, and arrangement, there is rhythm and coordination. The use of cabinets as partitions, with twists and turns, breaks the monotony of flat rows. The display in each cabinet adopts the method of highlighting key points without treating everything equally, so that each of the more than 5,000 exhibits has its own place, so that people's attention is not dispersed. After viewing all the exhibits, one can get a deep impression. In terms of color, in addition to the harmonious colors of the exhibits themselves, no dazzling colors unrelated to the theme are added, and no colorful backgrounds are used. The traditional expression methods of Chinese painting are absorbed, and beautiful pictures are drawn on clean paper. Try to avoid noise and commotion, and try to allow the audience to appreciate art carefully and peacefully in a quiet atmosphere.
    Let me continue to talk about the exhibits.
    The exhibits are classified according to the attributes of工艺加工, such as ivory carving, jade carving, stone carving, clay sculpture, and dough sculpture, which belong to the sculpture category. Carved lacquer, de-lacquered lacquer, flat lacquer, and lacquer inlaid with other materials belong to the lacquerware category. Bamboo weaving, grass weaving, and rattan weaving belong to the weaving category. In each category, equal importance is attached to appreciation and display items and ordinary daily necessities; traditional skills that must be protected, technologies that have been interrupted in history that must be restored, and new attempts are very prominent in each category.
    For example, in the sculpture category, ivory, a precious material with fine quality and simple and beautiful color, is used to try to express various life themes. "Basket of a Hundred Flowers" takes the theme of "Let a hundred flowers bloom," and uses ivory, a material that can be carved extremely finely, to express the vivid and beautiful image of the flowers, and inherits traditional techniques. Another work, "Five Warriors of Langya Mountain," uses the same raw material but uses a different technique to express the great revolutionary will of revolutionary heroes, and absorbs Western carving techniques as an attempt. Although the old artists are not yet mature enough in Western expression techniques, it still gives people a fresh feeling. Taking these two works as examples, in the art variety of ivory carving, compared with the works in the old society that deliberately smoked the beautiful ivory until it was withered and yellow, or painted it with vulgar colors, and carved some Buddha statues and ancient beauties in order to cater to the tastes of the bourgeoisie, they are not comparable, and the techniques have also broken through the old conventions. However, we will never rudely negate the outstanding traditional techniques. For example, the thirty-layer ivory flower ball is also the crystallization of the wisdom of the working people. Through the artist's creation, ivory balls have appeared in a variety of different styles.
    In jade carving, there are two works. In terms of artistic style and artistic handling, it can be said that they have achieved the desired results. One is the incense burner made by the Beijing Jade Factory. It uses carving to reflect the luster of the jade, the translucency of the jade, and the sharp outlines after processing. In the majestic overall beauty, the delicate patterns are looming, which is amazing that the beauty of creation and human wisdom are combined to produce art. Another work is a crystal bottle made by the Shanghai Jade Factory. There is no carving on it. The shape is simple and beautiful, like a beautiful column of water spraying, completely transparent, like a lotus emerging from the water, spotless. It is very pleasant to see. I think these two artists who made and processed it have deeply gained the samadhi of art. The beauty of crystal and the beauty of jade are expressed appropriately, and the beauty of the original material is transformed into the beauty of art through processing, giving dead material life and soul. I lingered in front of these two works and was reluctant to leave. I really got a high degree of pleasure in appreciation. However, although these two works are so moving, they do not take away the unique style of other sculptures. For example, Fujian's boxwood carvings, Shoushan stone carvings, and Beijing, Tianjin, Fujian, and Jiangsu's clay sculptures and dough sculptures still have their own merits. Just take clay sculpture as an example. Experienced old artists use readily available soil to shape various character images. If you put a work on your desk, it is enough to add to the joy of life. For example, the graceful movements of opera characters and the innocent expressions of children's toys can bring people fun, without reducing its artistic value because of the ordinary material or the small size of the work. Just take the sculpture department as an example. From jade carving and ivory carving to clay sculpture and dough sculpture, they are like vivid and beautiful poems in life, all with the power to move people artistically.
    We see the lacquerware and weaving departments, and deeply appreciate the moving aspects of modeling and color. In particular, a batch of lacquerware sent from Fujian Province, only de-lacquered lacquer bottles composed of two beautiful borders, plus crystal colors like cloisonné, in addition to modeling and color, there are no extra and complicated decorations, which makes the itself a highly decorative whole. Folk woven bamboo baskets and grass baskets in weaving use the rhythm of the thickness and density of bamboo filaments to make ingenious weaving, so kind and so cute, like folk tunes and folk dances, so amusing and so never tire of watching and listening. If you stop in this department and observe carefully, almost all the audience are attracted by the moving power of art, and can't help but marvel at the ingenuity of the Chinese working people, the exquisite art, and the extensive and profound mass base of art.
    The deep foundation of Chinese art is in the folk, and the people's life is the source of all art. Please take a look at the embroidery, drawnwork, and brocade weaving of ethnic minorities. Most of these are the works of ethnic minority women. They have learned art from their mothers since they were young, and it has been passed down from generation to generation. They never imitate other people's paintings, but focus on originality. The patterns and colors they use imitate nature but also transcend nature. Their works are closely integrated with their lives, so they are lively and fresh, and unconventional. The disadvantage is that a work takes a lot of man-hours over the years. In this exhibition, we can see that the Yunnan Printing and Dyeing Factory has printed a large number of handmade works of ethnic minorities using modern printing and dyeing methods. The printed works do not reduce the advantages of the original works, but the cost is reduced and can be popularized. I especially recommend this work of great significance by the Yunnan Printing and Dyeing Factory.
    In addition to the artworks of ethnic minorities, this exhibition introduced folk pottery from important areas across the country. I really like folk pottery, because folk pottery has high practical value and artistic value, and more importantly, the artistry of folk pottery. These potteries are generous and unpretentious, fully expressing the Chinese national spirit. It has not been affected by the shallow, frivolous, and vulgar artistic schools of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, and retains the traditional national style.
    The teachers and students of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts selected Fengfeng, a folk porcelain area left over from the Song Dynasty, to make a batch of experimental porcelain. It absorbs the simple tradition and intends to reverse the bad influence of the artistic style of the late imperial dynasty and the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. This influence is a historical legacy, not from the folk, and will inevitably be negated by the requirements of the new history and the new people. We can also take a look at the porcelain sent from various places in the exhibition. Many of them have also emerged from the complicated framework and present a new atmosphere, such as Jingdezhen's blue and white porcelain, Yingqing's tea sets, and Liling's underglaze colorful tea sets. The shape and decoration meet the requirements of the new era. This is a very gratifying phenomenon. This is a great leap forward in the artistic style of porcelain, which is worth writing about! The porcelain of the Song Dynasty, both in terms of shape and color, was a further healthy development of Chinese folk pottery. In this exhibition, there are recently restored Henan Jun kiln porcelain and Zhejiang Longquan kiln porcelain, which are both excellent examples in the history of Chinese porcelain development.
    Due to the Party and the government's emphasis on tradition and concern for the excellent skills of folk artists, and vigorously restored, this will undoubtedly add a large number of practical, economical, and beautiful supplies to the people's lives in the future, in terms of the style in which Chinese porcelain can be inherited and developed.
    Therefore, this exhibition not only summarizes the achievements in various aspects in the past few years, but also opens a new page in the history of Chinese arts and crafts. Its role is to affirm achievements and encourage the future, so as to move towards new victories on the basis of victory.
    The exhibition is rich and colorful, and too beautiful to take in all at once. It cannot be fully expressed in a short article. National and famous varieties such as cloisonné enamel, embroidery, velvet silk flowers, toys, drawnwork, glass, and knitted items have made progress; especially toys and glass, which are still young art varieties in our country. In the short span of three or four years, there has been great development and improvement. The speed of progress can be called a thousand miles a day.
    After viewing this exhibition, and looking back at the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition, it paints a picture of China's life today and tomorrow for us. Whether in material life or spiritual life, it is thriving and improving. How can it not make people energetic and full of spirit!

    和人民生活息息相关的展览
    ——全国工艺美术展览会观后
  　雷圭元
    这次全国工艺美术展览会中的优美的艺术品，是全国各省市老一辈的艺人、青年的艺人和工艺美术学校的教师、学生们在大跃进的形势下，以艺术形象反映我们丰富多彩的生活，用自己的创造性的劳动来作为对伟大祖国建国十周年的献礼。
    假使这些作品能够发出声音的话，就是一篇美丽的乐章，而它的主题，就是欢呼社会主义的胜利！
    从这里陈列的作品中，可以看到作者的爱国主义的、社会主义的思想和真挚朴素的感情。透过这些作品，深深地体会到许多工艺美术工作者、从七八十岁的老艺人到十几岁的学徒，他们有着鼓足干劲、力争上游、把自己的精力无保留地拿出来贡献给国家、贡献给人民的愿望。那怕自己技巧还不很成熟，总想把看到的、感受到的新鲜事物，利用物质材料，那怕是一根草、一块泥巴，都想尽方法把它表达出来，歌颂党，歌颂大跃进，歌颂总路线，歌颂人民公社，总想把许多新事物用美丽的形象、色彩，塑造成一件一件美丽的艺术品，广为流传，家喻户晓，深入人心。
    当我们走进展览会的大门，便会使人有一种开朗朴素，但又丰富多彩的感觉，在布置分类编排方面，有节奏，协调一致。利用了柜子作为间隔，曲折回旋，打破了平列的单调。每一个柜中的陈列采用了重点突出而不平均对待的办法，使五千多件展品都有它自己的位置，使人的视线不分散，看完了全部展品，能够得到深刻的印象。在色彩上，除了展品本身的色泽调和之外，不附加刺目的与主题无关的色彩，不采用花花绿绿的背景，吸收了中国画的传统表现方法，洁净的纸张上画出美丽的图画。尽力避免闹闹嚷嚷，尽量使观众在幽静的气氛中，细心地、安详地欣赏艺术。
    让我接着谈一谈展品吧。
    展品是依据工艺加工的属性来分类的，如牙雕、玉雕、石雕、泥塑、面塑等属于雕塑一类。雕漆、脱胎漆、平漆、漆上镶嵌等属于漆品一类。竹编、草编、藤编等属于编织一类。而每一类中欣赏陈设品和普通日用品并重；传统的技巧必需保护的，历史上中断了的技术必需恢复的，新的尝试的作品在每一类中也非常突出。
    例如在雕塑这一类中，利用象牙这一种贵重的、品质细致、色泽朴素优美的材料，尝试着表现各种生活题材。像“百花篮”是以百花齐放为主题，用象牙这种可以作极其精细的雕刻材料把花朵的生动美丽的形象表达出来，而且继承了传统的技法。另一作品“狼牙山五壮士”以同样的原料却用另外一种手法表现了革命英雄的伟大的革命意志，并吸取了西洋的雕刻手法作为尝试，尽管老艺人们对西洋的表现手法还不够成熟，但仍然给人一种新鲜的感觉。拿这两件作品来看，在象牙雕刻这一艺术品种上与过去旧社会中为了迎合资产阶级的趣味，把优美的象牙故意熏得枯黄，或者涂上俗不可耐的颜色，雕些佛像和古装美人的作品，不可同日而语了，而且在技法上也突破了陈规。但是我们也决不把特出的传统技法粗暴地否定，像三十层的象牙花球也是劳动人民智慧的结晶，通过艺人的创造，象牙球已出现了多种不同的风格。
    在玉器雕刻中，有两件作品，在艺术风格上，艺术手法的处理上，可以说都达到了应有的效果。一件是北京玉器厂制作的熏炉，它以雕工来体现玉器的光泽，玉质的半透明和加工后的锋芒轮廓，在浑厚的整体美中，若隐若现地精细的花纹，令人惊叹造物之美和人类的智慧相结合而产生的艺术。另外一件作品，是上海玉器厂制作的水晶瓶，上面一点雕刻都没有，造型单纯美丽，像一柱优美的喷水，通体透明，像出水芙蓉，一尘不染，看了令人异常愉快。我想这两位制作加工的艺术家，深得艺术三昧。把水晶之美和玉的美均恰如其份地表达出来，而且经过加工把原来材料之美变为艺术之美，给死的材料以生命以灵魂。我在这两件作品的前面徘徊不忍离去，真是得到了欣赏的高度愉快。但是，尽管这两件作品如此动人，却并不夺去其他雕塑品的特有风格，像福建的黄杨木雕，寿山石刻，北京、天津、福建、江苏的泥塑、面塑，依然各有千秋。就像泥塑吧，有经验的老艺人们利用随地皆有的泥土，塑造了各种人物形象，如果案头放上一件作品，足以增添生活的愉快，像戏曲人物的优美动作，儿童玩具的天真表情都能逗人乐趣，不以其材料的普通，不以其作品之小而减少其艺术价值。就拿雕刻这一部门来说，从玉雕、牙雕到泥塑、面塑，就像生活中生动的美丽的诗，都具有艺术感人的力量。
    我们看到漆器和编织这两个部门，深深体会到造型和色彩的动人之处。特别是福建省送来的一批漆器，仅仅用两条优美的边线组成的脱胎漆瓶，加上像七宝烧一样的晶体的色泽，造型和色彩之外，别无多余的繁琐的装饰，使本身就是高度的装饰整体。编织物中的民间编织竹篮、草篮，利用竹丝的粗细疏密的节奏，作了巧妙的编织，那样亲切，那样可爱，像民间小调、民间舞蹈一样，那样逗人，那样百看百听不厌。你从这一个部门停留下来，细细观察，差不多的观众都为艺术的动人力量所吸引，不禁为中国劳动人民的心灵手巧，艺术的精湛，艺术的广泛深厚的群众基础而惊叹。
    中国艺术的深厚的基础是在民间，人民的生活是一切艺术的源泉。请你看一下少数民族的刺绣、挑花、织锦吧。这些多是少数民族妇女的作品，她们从小就向母亲学艺，而且世代相传。她们决不模仿别人的画稿，而着力于别出心裁。她们所用的花纹色彩，模拟自然而又超乎自然。她们的作品和生活紧密地结合在一起，因此活泼新鲜，不拘一格。缺点是一件作品经年累月，花费工时很多。这次展出中，可以看到云南印染厂把少数民族的手工作品用现代印染方法大量印出来了。印制的作品，不减原作的优点，但成本降低，可以普及。我是特别推崇云南印染厂这一个具有重大意义的工作的。
    除了少数民族的艺术品外，这一次展览会中介绍了全国重要地区的民间陶器。我非常喜爱民间陶器，因为民间陶器的实用价值和艺术价值都高，而更重要的是民间陶器的艺术性。这些陶器落落大方，不加修饰，充分表现了中国的民族气派。它没有受半封建半殖民地的浅薄的、轻浮的、庸俗的艺术流派的影响，保留着民族的传统风格。
    中央工艺美术学院的师生们选择了宋代遗留下来的民间瓷区——峰峰，作了一批试验瓷器。吸收朴素的传统，意图在艺术风格上反一反皇朝末期和半封建半殖民地的艺术风格上的不良影响。这种影响是历史的遗留，而不是来自民间的，也必然为新的历史、新的人民的要求所否定。我们还可以看一看展览会中各地送来的瓷器，有许多也从繁琐的框框中脱颖而出，呈现一番新的气象，像景德镇的青花，影青的茶具，醴陵的釉下五彩茶具等等，造型和装饰都合乎新时代的要求，这是非常可喜的现象，这是瓷器艺术风格上一个大大的跃进，值得大书而特书的！宋代的瓷器，无论在造型上、色彩上都是中国民间陶器的进一步的健康的发展，这次展览会中，有最近恢复的河南钧窑瓷器和浙江龙泉窑瓷器，都是中国瓷器发展史上优良的典范。
    由于党和政府的重视传统和关怀民间艺人的优良技艺，大力加以恢复，这给今后中国的瓷器，在风格上得以继承和发扬，无疑地会给人民的生活增添一大批适用、经济、美观的用品。
    所以，这次展览会，不但总结了这几年各方面的成绩，而且在中国工艺美术史上开始了新的一页。其作用是肯定成绩，策励将来，以便在胜利的基础上走向新的胜利。
    展览会是丰富多彩，美不胜收的，不是短文可以表达周全。像全国性的、著名的品种景泰兰、刺绣、绒绢花、玩具、挑补花、玻璃、编结物等都有进步；尤其是玩具和玻璃，在我国还是年轻的艺术品种之一，短短的三四年中已经有了极大的发展和提高，其进步之快，可以称之为一日千里之势。
    看完了这个展览会，再回顾一下全国工业交通展览会，给我们描绘出了一幅中国今天和明天的生活的图画，无论在物质生活和精神生活方面都是欣欣向荣，臻臻日上，怎不令人意气风发，精神百倍呢！
