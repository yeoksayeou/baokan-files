    Semimonthly International Review
    (November 1st to 15th)
    Anti-American Tide Continues to Rise in the Caribbean
    While the Cuban people are increasingly and resolutely adhering to the struggle against American interference in their internal affairs and defending the fruits of their revolution, the anti-American storm in the Caribbean has spread to two other countries. The people of Panama and Puerto Rico have also recently launched a new wave of anti-American struggles.
    November 3rd was the 56th anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Panama. On this day, Panamanian students and youths held demonstrations and marches near the American-occupied Panama Canal Zone, demanding the maintenance of national sovereignty and the recovery of the Panama Canal. However, when the marching队伍 approached the border area of the Canal Zone, the American police, armed with guns and live ammunition and occupying the Canal Zone, rudely tore up the Panamanian flag and opened fire on the unarmed demonstrators, injuring more than one hundred people. This bloody suppression by the American authorities aroused unparalleled anger among the Panamanian people. They held demonstrations and marches day after day to protest against the brutal behavior of the United States and more resolutely demanded the recovery of Panama's rights over the Canal. In the capital, Panama City, outraged demonstrators also attacked the American Embassy and some American enterprises, tearing up the American flag. Driven by the mass struggle, many Panamanian political figures, including President de la Guardia, also protested to the United States, opposing the continued American occupation of the Panama Canal. On November 9, the Panamanian National Assembly even passed a resolution stating that it would fight to the end to recover the Panama Canal occupied by the United States. Now, striving to recover the rights and interests of the Panama Canal has become the unanimous struggle goal of people from all walks of life in Panama, and the United States is the "target of public criticism" in this struggle.
    The Panama Canal was built by the United States by occupying Panamanian territory through coercive means, according to the unequal US-Panama treaty signed in 1903. This canal not only seriously infringes upon Panama's territorial sovereignty, but also has become an important tool for the United States to carry out economic plunder. The rent paid by the United States to the Panamanian government is less than one-twentieth of the more than 41 million U.S. dollars in canal toll revenue. Not only that, the United States also stationed 20 to 30 thousand troops in the Canal Zone, using it as a base for controlling and invading Panama and other countries in Central and South America. This situation is naturally intolerable to the Panamanian people. For decades, the Panamanian people have been demanding the abolition of the unequal US-Panama treaty and the recovery of Panama's rights and interests in the Panama Canal, and have carried out unremitting struggles for this purpose. The recent outbreak of anti-American incidents is a manifestation of the further development of this struggle.
    While the Panamanian people were launching an anti-American struggle, Puerto Rico, under direct American control, also broke out on November 4 in a movement against American occupation. In the Sabana Grande area, the masses destroyed American radio lines, telegraph stations, and telephones, tore up the American flag, and distributed leaflets demanding the release of imprisoned leaders of the national independence movement. At the same time, the military depot of the Puerto Rican National Police was also attacked.
    The recent anti-American incidents in Panama and Puerto Rico, as well as the revolutionary struggle of the Cuban people, show that the national independence movements of the Latin American countries are rising one after another, giving the new colonial empire of the United States increasingly greater blows.
    African Anti-Imperialist Struggle is Full of Vigor
    At the beginning of this month, a large-scale conflict broke out in Stanleyville, Belgian Congo, between the local people and the military police of the Belgian colonial authorities. This is a continuation of the struggle launched by the Congolese people in January this year against colonial rule. The direct cause of the conflict was the colonial police's attempt to disrupt the ongoing conference of the Congolese National Movement Party and arrest the party's leader, Lumumba. The masses attending the conference fought back against the armed police with stones, bows and arrows, and spears. Although the police released tear gas and opened fire, causing heavy casualties among the local people, the anti-colonialist fire ignited by the residents of Stanleyville quickly spread to other areas. On November 2, large-scale strikes occurred in the four districts of Yatomelma, Elisabeth, Bangamisha and Basoko near Stanleyville. The situation in Yangambi City, fifty miles away from Stanleyville, was also "increasingly tense." Many cities held demonstrations and mass rallies, strongly protesting the bloody suppression of innocent residents by the Belgian colonial authorities.
    Faced with the surging torrent of anti-colonialism, the Belgian colonial authorities had to rack their brains to devise countermeasures. On the one hand, it rapidly mobilized mechanized troops equipped with heavy weapons to carry out bloody suppression and frenzied massacres of the Congolese people striving for national independence, and arrested the Chairman of the Congolese National Movement Party, Lumumba, and other nationalist leaders; on the other hand, it wanted to use deceptive means to confuse the Congolese people and relax their will to fight. Belgian Colonial Affairs Minister De Schrijver recently announced that the Belgian government had decided to hold a so-called "round table conference" in Congo from November 20 to 30 with "Congolese political leaders" to discuss the issue of Congo's "independence in stages." However, the so-called Congo's "independence in stages" plan is merely a means for the Belgian government to consolidate its colonial rule. According to De Schrijver's explanation, Congo after "independence" cannot "separate" from Belgium, and a so-called "joint system" should be established between the two countries. This clearly shows the Belgian government's sinister conspiracy. De Schrijver also put forward a deceptive plan in the economic field, vaguely stating that the Belgian government proposed to establish a "special aid fund" organization for Congo in 1960 and provide 1 billion Belgian francs to establish a "Congo Development Association," etc., attempting to soften the Congolese people's struggle for immediate independence with "economic assistance." However, all these tricks commonly used by colonialists cannot save the crisis of Belgian colonial rule. The Congolese people's struggle against colonial rule and for national independence is developing vigorously. Even an Agence France-Presse reporter was worried about Belgium's situation, saying that it was "always on the verge of a major tragedy."
    The vigorous anti-colonialist struggle launched by the Congolese people has caused a huge reaction throughout Africa. In the Luanda region bordering Congo, the Luanda people, who have long suffered from colonial slavery and feudal oppression, launched an armed uprising. In Kenya and Uganda under British colonial rule, strikes and demonstrations have also erupted continuously recently. Twenty thousand African railway workers in Kenya held a national general strike on November 14 to protest against the racial discrimination of the British colonial authorities. The Africans in the Union of South Africa, especially women, are also carrying out unyielding struggles under extremely difficult conditions to protest against the government's apartheid policy. These facts fully demonstrate that the anti-colonialist wave in Africa is increasingly fiercely impacting colonial rule. The British Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" also had to admit that "the current development in Africa is actually of earth-shattering significance."
    Under the banner of opposing colonialism and striving for national independence, the unity of the African people is being further strengthened. The recent African Trade Union Conference held in Accra decided to prepare for the establishment of the All-African Trade Union Federation to strengthen the unity and cooperation of the African working class and promote the cause of African national liberation. The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council also recently issued a statement calling on the people of Asian and African countries to hold "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day" on December 1 to actively support the African people's struggle for national independence. Although imperialism is still making a dying struggle, as long as the African people unite and receive the active support of the people of the world, they will surely win the final victory of national liberation.
    American Conspiracy to Intervene in Laos
    The American conspiracy to use the United Nations to interfere in Laos has recently suffered a shameful setback. The so-called "Laos Investigation Subcommittee" illegally dispatched by the United Nations Security Council in September issued an "investigation report" on November 6, which had to admit that the materials it had collected were "not sufficient to prove that regular troops of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had crossed the border." Even the "New York Times" admitted that this so-called "investigation report" did not have the "facts" and "strong basis" that the United States could use to intervene in Laos, and therefore expressed great disappointment with the "report."
    It should be said that this "Laos Investigation Subcommittee" of the United Nations, adhering to the will of the United States, did its best to fabricate facts and slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The "investigation" committee quoted the words of the so-called "refugees," "prisoners," and "witnesses" arranged by the Laotian Sananikone government, insisting that there were some "Viet Minh" in the Lao combat troops. It also fabricated rumors based on documents from the Laotian government, saying that the army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had participated in the attack on Laos. However, no matter how the "investigation" committee distorted the truth, and no matter how the Sananikone government even established a special agency to fabricate "evidence," it could not but declare the bankruptcy of this conspiracy planned by the United States. In the eyes of discerning people, it is ridiculous for this illegal "investigation" committee to verify the Sananikone government's accusation against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam under the instruction of the United States, solely based on the "documents" of the Laotian Sananikone government. The statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding the report of the "Investigation Subcommittee" of the United Nations Security Council solemnly pointed out that "the American imperialists and the Laotian authorities, in the absence of a pretext to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for 'direct aggression' against Laos, have resorted to despicable means in an attempt to accuse the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of 'assisting former Lao combat troops' from abroad."
    At present, although the United Nations' "investigation" conspiracy has failed, the United States has not given up further planning new conspiracies for the United Nations to interfere in Laos, so that it can drag other member states of the United Nations into the water, laying the groundwork for its further aggression and interference in Laos. After the "investigation report" was published, White, a spokesman for the US State Department, still shamelessly claimed that the report did not deny that there were troops from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "participating" in the former Lao combat troops, but "merely pointed out that it was difficult to identify." White also requested the United Nations to establish a permanent representative in Laos. The US delegation to the United Nations also issued a similar statement, advocating that the United Nations take "further measures" and send people to be permanently stationed in Laos. Recently, the American aggressor group has been actively engaged in establishing a so-called "standing committee" in Laos. At the same time, UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld "visited" Laos. An Associated Press dispatch on November 6 has revealed that Hammarskjöld's "visit" to Laos is closely related to the conspiracy plan of the United States to "station the United Nations in Laos." Hammarskjöld has announced that he will send his personal representative to stay in Laos.
    While the United States is plotting the United Nations to interfere in Laos, American military personnel and ammunition are being continuously transported into Laos, further deteriorating the situation in Laos. The Laotian Sananikone government is intensifying its frenzied suppression of the patriotic and democratic forces in Laos, and under the instigation of the United States, it is further persecuting Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front. The Laotian authorities had originally decided to stage a "trial" of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front on November 2, but due to pressure from the Laotian people and world public opinion, the Laotian authorities were forced to announce a postponement of the "trial." However, this persecution conspiracy of the US and Sananikone group has not ended. Vientiane Radio is still clamoring that the illegal "trial" of Souphanouvong and others must be carried out. This conspiracy of the US-Sananikone group, which aims to further expand the civil war in Laos and intensify the tense situation in Laos, is being increasingly strongly condemned and opposed by fair world opinion.

    半月国际述评
    （十一月一日到十五日）
    加勒比海的反美浪潮继续高涨
    当古巴人民正在日益坚决地坚持反对美国干涉内政、保卫革命成果的斗争的时候，加勒比海的反美风暴又蔓延到另外两个国家。巴拿马和波多黎各的人民，最近也掀起了反美斗争的新浪潮。
    11月3日是巴拿马共和国独立五十六周年纪念日。这一天，巴拿马的学生和青年在美国占领下的巴拿马运河区附近举行了示威游行，要求维护国家主权，收回巴拿马运河。但是当游行队伍进到运河区边境地带时，占据着运河区的荷枪实弹的美国警察竟然横蛮地撕毁巴拿马国旗，并且向手无寸铁的游行群众开枪射击，使一百多人受伤。美国当局的这种血腥镇压手段，激起了巴拿马人民的无比愤怒。他们连日不断地举行示威游行，抗议美国的残暴行为，并且更加坚决地要求收回巴拿马对运河的权益。在首都巴拿马城，怒不可遏的示威群众还袭击了美国大使馆和一些美国企业，撕毁了美国国旗。在群众斗争的推动下，包括总统德拉古阿迪亚在内的许多巴拿马政界人士也对美国表示抗议，反对美国继续霸占巴拿马运河。11月9日，巴拿马国民议会更通过一项决议，表示一定要为收回被美国霸占的巴拿马运河斗争到底。现在，争取收回巴拿马运河的权益，已成为巴拿马全国各阶层人民一致的斗争目标，而美国则是这个斗争的“众矢之的”。
    巴拿马运河是美国根据1903年签订的美巴不平等条约，以强取豪夺的手段，霸占巴拿马的领土而修筑的。这条运河不但严重地侵犯了巴拿马的领土主权，而且成了美国进行经济掠夺的重要工具。美国付给巴拿马政府的租金，还不到运河通行费收入四千一百多万美元的二十分之一。不但如此，美国还在运河区驻扎二、三万名军队，把它当作对巴拿马和中南美洲其他国家进行控制侵略的基地。这种情况当然是巴拿马人民所不能容忍的。几十年来，巴拿马人民一直要求废除美巴不平等条约，收回巴拿马运河的权益，并为此而进行了不懈的斗争。最近爆发的反美事件，是这个斗争进一步深入发展的表现。
    与巴拿马人民展开反美斗争的同时，在美国直接控制下的波多黎各也在11月4日爆发了反对美国占领的运动。萨巴纳格兰德地方的群众破坏了美国的电台线路、发报台、电话，撕毁了美国国旗，并且散发了要求释放被监禁的民族独立运动领袖的传单。同时，波多黎各国家警察的军用仓库也遭到了袭击。
    巴拿马和波多黎各人民最近的反美事件，以及古巴人民的革命斗争说明，拉丁美洲各国人民的民族独立运动，正在彼伏此起，给予美国这个新殖民帝国以越来越大的打击。
    非洲反帝斗争生气勃勃
    本月初，在比属刚果的斯坦利维尔，爆发了当地人民同比利时殖民当局的军警发生大规模冲突的事件。这是今年1月刚果人民掀起的反对殖民统治的斗争的继续。发生冲突的直接原因是，殖民警察企图破坏刚果民族运动党正在举行的大会和逮捕这个政党的领袖卢蒙巴。参加大会的群众用石头、弓箭和长矛同武装警察展开了搏斗。尽管警察放了催泪弹，并且开了枪，造成当地人民的重大伤亡，但是，由斯坦利维尔居民点起的反殖民主义的怒火，迅速蔓延到其他地区。11月2日，在斯坦利维尔附近的亚托梅尔马、伊利莎伯、班加米沙和巴索科四个地区发生了大规模的罢工。离开斯坦利维尔五十英里的扬干比城的形势也“越来越紧张”。许多城市纷纷举行示威游行和群众大会，强烈抗议比利时殖民当局对无辜居民的血腥镇压。
    面对着汹涌澎湃的反殖民主义的洪流，比利时殖民当局不得不煞费心机地筹划对策。它一方面急速调动配备重型武器的机械化部队，对争取民族独立的刚果人民进行血腥的镇压和疯狂的屠杀，并把刚果民族运动党主席卢蒙巴和其他民族主义领袖逮捕入狱；另一方面则想用欺骗手段来迷惑刚果人民，松懈他们的斗争意志。比利时殖民事务大臣德舒里弗最近宣布，比利时政府决定在11月20日到30日在刚果同“刚果的政治领袖”举行所谓“圆桌会议”来讨论刚果“分阶段独立”的问题。而所谓刚果“分阶段独立”计划，不过是比利时政府巩固其殖民统治的手段。按照德舒里弗的解释，“独立”后的刚果不能和比利时“分离”，两个国家之间应当建立所谓“联合制度”。这就清楚地表明比利时政府心怀叵测的阴谋。德舒里弗还提出了一项在经济方面的欺骗性计划，空洞地表示比利时政府建议在1960年建立一个对刚果的“特别援助基金”组织和提供十亿比利时法郎来建立一个“刚果发展协会”等，企图以“经济援助”来软化刚果人民要求立即实现独立的斗争。但是，这一切殖民主义者惯用的伎俩，并不能挽救比利时殖民统治的危机。刚果人民反对殖民统治和争取民族独立的斗争正在蓬蓬勃勃地发展着。连法新社记者也为比利时的处境忧心忡忡，说它“永远处在爆发大悲剧的边缘”。
    刚果人民掀起的轰轰烈烈的反殖民主义斗争，在整个非洲引起巨大的反响。在刚果毗邻的卢安达地区，长期遭受殖民奴役和封建压迫的卢安达人民举行了武装起义。在英国殖民统治下的怯尼亚和乌干达，最近也不断爆发罢工和示威游行事件。怯尼亚的两万非洲铁路工人在11月14日举行全国总罢工，抗议英国殖民当局的种族歧视行为。南非联邦的非洲人，特别是妇女，为了抗议政府的种族隔离政策，也在极端艰苦的条件下进行不屈不挠的斗争。这些事实充分说明，非洲的反殖民主义浪潮正在日益激烈地冲击着殖民主义的统治。英国保守党的“每日电讯报”也不得不承认，“非洲目前的发展实际上具有翻天复地的意义”。
    在反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的旗帜下，非洲人民的团结正在进一步加强。最近在阿克拉召开的非洲工会会议，决定筹备成立全非工会联合会，以加强非洲工人阶级的团结和合作，促进非洲的民族解放事业。亚非人民团结理事会最近也发表声明，号召亚非各国人民在12月1日举行“帝国主义滚出非洲日”，积极支持非洲人民争取民族独立的斗争。尽管帝国主义还在进行垂死的挣扎，但是，只要非洲人民团结一致，在全世界人民的积极支持下，一定会获得民族解放的最后胜利。
    美国干涉老挝的阴谋
    美国企图利用联合国干涉老挝的阴谋最近遭到了可耻的挫折。9月份由联合国安全理事会非法派出的所谓“老挝调查小组委员会”于11月6日发表的“调查报告”不得不承认，它所搜集的材料“不足以证实越南民主共和国的正规军队已经越境”。甚至连“纽约时报”也承认，这个所谓“调查报告”没有美国可借以干涉老挝的“事实”和“有力根据”，因此对“报告”表示大失所望。
    应该说，联合国的这个“老挝调查小组委员会”秉承美国的意志，是竭尽了?造事实和污蔑越南民主共和国的能事的。“调查”委员会援引了老挝萨纳尼空政府所布置的所谓“难民”、“俘虏”、“证人”的话，硬说寮国战斗部队中有什么“越盟人”。并且还根据老挝政府的文件，造谣说越南民主共和国军队曾参加进攻老挝。但是，不论“调查”委员会如何颠倒黑白，也不论萨纳尼空政府甚至成立了?造“证据”的专门机构，最后不能不宣告美国所策划的这个阴谋的破产。在明眼人看来，这个非法的“调查”委员会仅仅根据老挝萨纳尼空政府的“文件”来证实萨纳尼空政府在美国授意下对越南民主共和国的诬告，是十分可笑的。越南民主共和国外交部就联合国安全理事会“调查小组委员会”的报告发表的声明严正地指出，“美帝国主义和老挝当局在它们无法找到诬蔑越南民主共和国‘直接侵略’老挝的口实的情况下，竟又采取了可耻的手段，企图加罪越南民主共和国从国外‘帮助前寮国战斗部队’。”
    目前，虽然联合国的“调查”阴谋遭到了失败，但是美国仍未放弃进一步策划联合国干涉老挝的新阴谋，以便它把联合国其他成员国拖下水去，为它进一步侵略和干涉老挝埋下伏笔。在“调查报告”发表以后，美国国务院发言人怀特仍然无耻地声称，报告并未否定有越南民主共和国军队“参加”前寮国战斗部队，而“仅仅是指出难于辨认”。怀特并且提出要求联合国在老挝设立常驻代表。美国驻联合国代表团也发表类似的声明，鼓吹联合国采取“进一步措施”，派人常驻老挝。最近以来，美国侵略集团正在为在老挝设立一个所谓“常设委员会”而进行着积极的活动。与此同时，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德“访问”了老挝。美联社11月6日的电讯已经透露，哈马舍尔德的“访问”老挝是同美国策划的“联合国驻在老挝”的阴谋计划密切相关的。哈马舍尔德已经宣布，将派他的个人代表留驻老挝。
    在美国策划联合国干涉老挝阴谋的同时，美国的军事人员和武器弹药正在源源不绝地运入老挝，使老挝局势继续恶化。老挝萨纳尼空政府正在变本加厉地疯狂镇压老挝的爱国民主力量，并且在美国的唆使下，对苏发努冯等老挝爱国战线党领导人进行进一步的迫害。老挝当局本来已经决定在11月2日对苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人演出“审讯”的把戏，但由于老挝人民和世界公正舆论的压力，老挝当局被迫宣布延期“审判”。然而美国和萨纳尼空集团的这个迫害阴谋并未结束。万象电台仍在叫嚷对苏发努冯等人的非法“审讯”必须进行。美萨集团的这个旨在进一步扩大老挝内战、加剧老挝紧张局势的阴谋，正在遭到全世界公正舆论的日益强烈的谴责和反对。
