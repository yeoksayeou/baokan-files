Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Dispatch – While vigorously increasing the output of pig iron, the Shaoyang Special District of Hunan Province has also pushed the quality of pig iron to a higher level. The qualified rate of pig iron in the district's twenty-six iron plants has risen from 87% in September to 92% at the end of October. The Taipingli, Lengshuijiang, and Shaoyang City iron plants, which have consistently maintained the red flag for high quality, have always maintained a 100% qualified rate for pig iron; the number of iron plants achieving a 100% qualified rate has increased from three in the past to fifteen. Iron plants that previously believed it was difficult to produce high-quality iron due to poor ore conditions have also seen significant improvements in quality.

The Shaoyang Prefectural Party Committee has always adhered to the policy of high yield, high quality, and all-round leap forward in leading iron smelting production. When assigning production targets to various counties (cities), it simultaneously issued quality requirements and output targets, and strictly stipulated that unqualified pig iron would not be counted towards the task. In addition, improving the quality of pig iron was regarded as one of the important conditions for selecting red flag iron plants and red flag furnaces each time.

The hard work and deep involvement of leading cadres is an important factor in the continuous improvement of pig iron quality in the Shaoyang Special District. The Party secretaries and factory directors of all twenty-six iron plants in the district, as well as most of the section-level cadres, have adhered to the practice of leading production in production, grasping both output and quality. Of the eighty-six small blast furnaces that have been put into production throughout the district, cadres are basically responsible for each furnace, promptly discovering and solving key problems in improving the quality of pig iron. The Party secretary, deputy factory director, and factory director of the Anping Iron Plant in Lianyuan County went deep into the smelting workshop and mining area to conduct experimental plots, and the qualified rate of pig iron in the whole plant rapidly increased from 91% to 100%.

In terms of specific measures, each iron plant conscientiously implemented the "twelve-character classic" summarized by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and in particular adopted comprehensive technical measures such as parallel connection of fans, transformation of hot blast stoves, multi-nozzle combustion, increased height of chimneys, and four ore selections (ore selection at the stope, roasting selection, sieving selection, and charging selection), three prohibitions from entering the furnace (raw ore sand is not allowed to enter the furnace, hard stone impurities are not allowed to enter the furnace, and particle sizes that do not meet specifications are not allowed to enter the furnace), and desulfurization inside and outside the furnace, which effectively guaranteed the high-quality and high-yield of pig iron.

Each iron plant also universally adhered to the testing system for ore sand, coke, and pig iron, and the pig iron was tested furnace by furnace, piled and transported by grade, and the testing situation was grasped in a timely manner. If high-sulfur iron was found, measures were immediately taken to solve it, and it would not be released until the qualified rate was reached.

    无价之宝——小高炉红旗飘飘
    湖南邵阳十五个炼铁厂
    质量好——生铁合格率百分之百
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省邵阳专区在大力提高生铁产量的同时，也把生铁的质量推向了更高的水平。全区二十六个铁厂的生铁合格率，已由9月份的87％上升到10月底的92％。一贯保持优质红旗的太平里、冷水江、邵阳市等铁厂的生铁合格率，始终保持了百分之百；合格率达到百分之百的铁厂，已经由过去的三个上升到十五个。过去认为矿石条件不好、难于生产优质铁的铁厂，质量也有显著提高。
    中共邵阳地委在领导炼铁生产当中，始终坚持了高产优质全面跃进的方针，在给各县（市）下达生产指标时，把质量要求和产量指标同时下达，并且严格规定不合格的生铁一律不算任务。此外，每次评选红旗铁厂、红旗炉的时候，都把提高生铁质量作为重要条件之一。
    领导干部艰苦深入，是邵阳专区生铁质量不断提高的重要因素。全区二十六个铁厂的党委书记、厂长以及大部分的科室干部，都坚持了在生产中领导生产的做法，产量和质量一起抓。全区已投入生产的八十六座小高炉，基本上做到炉炉有干部负责，及时发现和解决提高生铁质量的关键问题。涟源县安平铁厂的党委书记、正副厂长，分别深入到冶炼车间和采矿工区搞试验田，全厂生铁合格率由91％迅速提高到100％。
    在具体措施上，各铁厂认真推行了冶金工业部总结的“十二字经”，特别采取了风机并联、改造热风炉、多嘴燃烧、加高烟筒，以及矿砂四选（出窿选焙烧选筛矿选上料选）、三不入炉（生矿砂不入炉、硬石杂质不入炉、粒度不合规格不入炉）和炉内炉外去硫等多种综合性的技术措施，有效地保证了生铁的优质高产。
    各铁厂还普遍坚持了矿砂、焦炭和生铁的化验制度，生铁做到炉炉化验、按级分堆、分运，及时掌握化验情况，发现高硫铁立即采取措施加以解决，不达到合格率不放手。
