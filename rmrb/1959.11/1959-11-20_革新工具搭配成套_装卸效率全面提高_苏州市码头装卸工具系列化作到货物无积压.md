    Innovative Tools Combined into Sets: Loading and Unloading Efficiency Comprehensively Improved
    Suzhou City's Serialized Dock Loading and Unloading Tools Achieve Zero Cargo Backlog
    (Our report) Since last year, Suzhou City Transportation Company has vigorously engaged in technological innovation, creating and improving 4,260 pieces of handling and loading/unloading equipment. Recently, they have achieved serialization of loading and unloading tools, greatly reducing workers' physical labor and improving transportation efficiency.
    Due to the lack of systematic organization and coordinated use, the various innovative tools created by this company over the past year or more have not been able to fully realize their efficiency. For example, after using electric booms, manual operation was still used for hatch work, and the booms could not be operated continuously, having to wait until the cargo hopper was full before starting again. Each time a cargo hopper was filled, the boom had to wait for ten minutes. Also, although the efficiency of truck transport was improved after truck deployment, stacking operations were still done by manual carrying, which could not keep up with the speed of the trucks. In March of this year, the company's Party organization put forward the call to "break through the ore hatch barrier." After mobilizing the masses, the method of "cargo hopper loading, boom lifting from the hatch" was researched, and eighty live-bottom cargo hoppers were added for fixed use on the route from the railway station dock to the Xujiang Steel Plant dock. This method solved the difficulty of ore lifting from the hatch and increased work efficiency by two to three times. In May of this year, the company began to vigorously promote the serialization of loading and unloading tools. As of September of this year, a total of twenty-two electric conveyors, seventeen electric booms, three electric stackers, four hatch machines, four motors, and forty-two tricycle pedal flatbed trucks, totaling twenty-eight projects and nine hundred and seventy-nine innovative tools, were created, thus realizing the serialization of loading and unloading tools at Suzhou's main docks.
    After the serialization of dock loading and unloading tools, the labor intensity of dock workers was reduced, labor was greatly saved, production efficiency was improved, and the phenomenon of port congestion and material backlog was changed. For example, the Dongming Coking Plant dock has a monthly coke throughput of 9,000 to 12,000 tons. In the past, there were ninety-two workers, all using manual loading and unloading. Each person's average work shift efficiency was only 3.6 tons per month. As a result, large quantities of materials piled up on the dock and could not be transported to the freight yard in time, causing the coal washing workshop to stop work and wait for materials. Now, with the installation of a 125-meter platform conveyor and two electric booms, a stone platform, and the allocation of cargo hoppers for loading, the serialization of loading and unloading tools has been achieved. It only takes eleven people to operate, and a ship carrying eighteen tons of cargo can be unloaded in twenty-seven minutes. The conveyor can transport thirty-four tons per hour, and coke is no longer backlogged at the dock.
    The realization of the serialization of loading and unloading tools has also increased port throughput capacity, accelerated ship turnaround, and changed the phenomenon of transportation being busy in the middle but stagnant at both ends. For example, the Electrical Appliance Factory dock used to rely entirely on manual loading and unloading. A 20-ton ship from the station to the factory dock was four or five kilometers away, and a round trip only took two hours, but one loading and one unloading would take more than three hours, so it could only turn around once or twice a day. Now, with the installation of two electric booms connected to five small flatbed trucks, and then transported to the stack by three conveyors, it can turn around three to five times a day, an increase of two to three times in ship turnaround compared to manual loading and unloading, expanding port throughput capacity by more than two times.
    After the serialization of loading and unloading tools was realized at these main docks in Suzhou City, 184 workers can be saved every day, which basically solves the current contradiction between transport volume and transport capacity, and ensures the realization of dock loading and unloading targets, supporting the development of the thousand-ton-kilometer movement for wooden boats.

### 革新工具搭配成套　装卸效率全面提高  苏州市码头装卸工具系列化作到货物无积压

    革新工具搭配成套　装卸效率全面提高
    苏州市码头装卸工具系列化作到货物无积压
    本报讯　苏州市搬运公司自去年大搞技术革新以来，创制与改良了搬运装卸工具四千二百六十件，最近又实现了装卸工具系列化，大大减轻了工人的体力劳动，提高了运输效率。
    这个公司一年多来创制的各种革新工具由于没有系统地组织起来，配套使用，效率不能充分发挥。如使用电动吊杆后，起舱仍用人工操作，吊杆不能连续开动，要等装满了货斗之后再开动，每装满一货斗，吊杆要等十分钟。又如实现车子化后搬运效率是提高了，但堆装作业仍用人扛，跟不上车子的速度。今年3月，公司党组织就提出“突破矿石起舱关”的号召，经过发动群众，研究出“货斗装船，吊杆起舱”的办法，增制了八十只活底货斗，固定在火车站码头至胥江钢铁厂码头航线使用。这一办法解决了矿石起舱难关，提高工效二至三倍。今年5月份又开始大搞装卸工具系列化。到今年9月份为止，共创制了电动输送机二十二台，电动吊杆十七台，电动堆装机三台，起舱机四架，马达四只，三轮脚踏大板车四十二辆等二十八个项目、九百七十九件革新工具，于是苏州市主要码头实现了装卸工具系列化。
    码头装卸工具系列化以后，减轻了码头工人的劳动强度，大大节约了劳动力，提高了生产效率，改变了港口堵塞、物资积压的现象。如东明焦化厂码头每月焦煤吞吐量达九千吨到一万二千吨，过去有九十二个工人，全用人工装卸，每人每月平均工班效率只有三点六吨，因此，大批物资堆积在码头上不能及时运进货场，造成洗煤车间停工待料。现在装置了一百二十五米平台输送机和电动吊杆二部、石制土台一座，并且配制了装货用的货斗，实现了装卸工具系列化，只要十一人操作，一艘载货十八吨的船，二十七分钟就可以卸完。输送机每小时可输送三十四吨，码头上再不积压焦煤了。
    实现装卸工具系列化，还增加了港口吞吐能力，加速了船舶周转，改变了运输忙在中间窝在两头的现象。如电气厂码头过去全用人工装卸，一艘二十吨船从车站至该厂码头四、五公里，往返航行只需二个多小时，而一装一卸就要花三个多小时，一天只能周转一、二次。现在安装了电动吊杆二部与五辆小板车衔接，再由三架输送机输送上堆，一天能周转三至五次，比人工装卸增加船舶周转二至三次，扩大港口吞吐能力两倍多。
    苏州市这几个主要码头在实现装卸工具系列化后，每天可节省劳力一百八十四人，基本上解决了当前运量与运力不相适应的矛盾，并保证了码头装卸指标的实现，支持了木船千吨公里运动的开展。
