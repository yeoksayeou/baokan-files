    American Workers Strike a Blow Against Steel Magnates
    Zhang Zhenya
　　The strike of 500,000 American steelworkers has persisted for three and a half months. The duration and tenacious fighting spirit of this strike are unprecedented. Originally, the twelve steel companies wanted to force the workers to submit through prolonged starvation, but they ended up shooting themselves in the foot. The strike has dealt a heavy blow to the American economy. President Eisenhower's invocation of anti-labor laws to undermine the strike exposes the panic of the American ruling class.
    The steel tycoons believed that the workers had just suffered the damage of the 1957 and 1958 economic crisis shifted onto them by monopoly capital and were heavily in debt, so the strike could not last long. At the same time, they made thorough preparations to deal with the strike in advance. The twelve companies that control 90% of U.S. steel production first established a "mutual aid pact" among themselves and then made strategic deployments in other industrial sectors, advising all steel users, such as automakers, construction companies, and warehouses, to quickly stockpile large quantities of steel in preparation for emergencies. When the strike broke out on July 15, U.S. companies' steel inventories reached a peak of 24.8 million tons (U.S. tons). The steel tycoons also received support and encouragement from government authorities and Congress. President Eisenhower repeatedly echoed their argument that wage increases would raise prices and cause inflation, attacking the steelworkers' reasonable demand for wage increases. Congressmen constantly clamored for strengthening anti-labor legislation to suppress workers. All of this strengthened the arrogance of the steel companies.
    However, all the wishful thinking of the steel tycoons fell through. "The New York Times" recently admitted in a dispatch that when the strike had reached one hundred days, "the morale of union members appeared more determined than ever. Wage losses and the difficulties their families faced in clothing and food due to the interruption of income have not brought...any sign of intending to yield. On the contrary, in the towns near the [steel] factories, the general sentiment is that they would rather 'never go back' than let the factory win." Not only that, but while the steelworkers were on strike, hundreds of thousands of workers in other industries such as copper, shipbuilding, packaging, maritime, glass, and textiles also launched strikes to oppose monopoly capitalists' intensified exploitation and refusal to increase wages. They joined the powerful steelworkers to form a massive wave of strikes.
    This steelworkers' strike, the longest in American history, has inflicted heavy losses on the American monopoly capital group. In more than one hundred and ten days, 310 steel plants and 118 iron ore mines across the country were closed due to the strike. Eleven transportation lines spanning thirty-two states from the East Coast to the West Coast were shut down. Automobile, shipbuilding, machine manufacturing, railway transportation, and the electrical industry also reduced production due to steel shortages, causing the U.S. gross national product in the third quarter to fall by $3.5 billion compared to the second quarter. It is estimated that steel companies have lost $3 billion in sales revenue and have had to watch helplessly as the domestic steel market is occupied by foreign steel companies. The already heavily indebted U.S. federal government has also lost $1.2 billion in tax revenue as a result. At the same time, with the reduction in production in many industrial sectors, bosses have laid off large numbers of workers. As of the 21st of last month, more than 800,000 people (including strikers) had been laid off.
    What is even more unsettling for the American ruling class is that they cannot fail to see that the steelworkers, who have always occupied a pivotal position in the labor movement, have strengthened their unity, raised their class consciousness, and promoted the entire labor movement in this strike. During the steelworkers' strike, an increasing number of worker brothers in other industries launched support movements. Coal miners, auto workers, construction workers, and dockworkers have all unanimously supported the steelworkers in this struggle. Under the pressure of the workers, the AFL-CIO also had to establish a special fund of $30 million per month to aid the striking steelworkers. The continuous occurrence of strikes by workers in many industries is a powerful support for the steelworkers' strike. All of this will have a profound impact on the American labor movement, which is struggling under the most difficult conditions.
    It is precisely because of this that President Eisenhower, in anxiety and unease, had to hastily wield the big stick and invoke the infamous Taft-Hartley Act's provisions prohibiting strikes to rescue the steel monopoly capital group. When the steel companies had made thorough preparations, believing that they could certainly subdue the steelworkers, the U.S. President had pretended to play the role of "non-intervention," stating that the steel strike was a manifestation of American "free democracy" and that the government "would not seek to end the national steel strike by means of an injunction." But in a short time, when the steel bosses found themselves in dire straits, the true face of this president as a loyal servant of the monopoly capital group was exposed, and the beautiful words of so-called "free democracy" were replaced by the big stick, a thoroughgoing suppression!
    However, the American president's seeking help from anti-labor laws cannot truly solve the problem for the major steel companies. This is because the steel tycoons originally wanted to force the workers to submit and accept the bosses' new contract to intensify exploitation, but the Taft-Hartley Act can only force the workers to return to work for eighty days, and the workers have not signed the contract drafted by the capitalists. In this way, firstly, due to technical reasons, the earliest normal production recovery of the steel companies will be a month after the resumption of work, so in reality, production can only be restored for about sixty days; secondly, if the workers still insist on striking after being forced to return to work for sixty days, then the steel companies will suffer even more severe losses. It is precisely because of this that the steel bosses expressed many complaints and blamed the president for not being able to help thoroughly after the president issued the strike injunction. In fact, this cannot be blamed on the president, because the president had anticipated this beforehand and made many efforts, secretly sending Vice President Nixon, Labor Secretary Mitchell, and Taylor, the "mediation" expert in labor disputes who recently became the chairman of the investigation committee, to negotiate with "United Steelworkers Union" President McDonald, forcing the union to concede. McDonald had also agreed to reduce the originally requested wage increase by one-third and abandon the condition of "reduced weekly working hours with wages unchanged," but did not accept the employers' demands for arbitrarily implementing the speed-up system and laying off workers. Therefore, the new contract drafted by the employers has still not been signed. But even now, the American ruling class is clamoring that if the workers continue to strike after returning to work for eighty days, the government will "force acceptance" of the enterprise. How loyal the American government is to the monopoly capital group!
    From this, it can be seen how big a blow the 500,000 steelworkers' strike has given to the American steel tycoons and the American government, and at the same time, how ruthlessly it has exposed the embarrassment of the American ruling class. This attack by American steel monopoly capital on steelworkers is a vicious step in the American bourgeoisie's anti-labor campaign. The American "Nation" magazine of September 5 pointed out that in the past year, American "labor has been subjected to increasingly frequent attacks by its enemies on almost all fronts," and "the situation is almost similar to the anti-communist wave in the early post-war period." However, perhaps outsiders see more clearly, the British "Economist" magazine recently expressed concern that the American steel tycoons want to defeat the labor movement in this offensive, which "cannot be accomplished overnight." In fact, the current result is more serious than the mouthpiece of this American steel tycoon's British partner worried about. This steelworkers' strike has made an important contribution to the American labor movement. As Comrade Foster, honorary chairman of the American Communist Party, pointed out, this steel strike is a decisive struggle, and it is not only fighting for itself but also fighting for the entire working class.

    美国工人给钢铁大王的打击
    张振亚
　　美国五十万钢铁工人大罢工，已坚持了三个半月。这次罢工的持久，斗志的顽强，前所未见。原来十二家钢铁公司想用长期饥饿的办法迫使工人屈服，结果是搬起石头砸了自己的脚，罢工使美国经济遭到沉重打击。艾森豪威尔总统搬出反劳工法来破坏罢工，正暴露了美国统治集团的惊惶失措。
    钢铁大亨们曾认为工人们刚经受了1957年、1958年垄断资本转嫁经济危机的损害，欠债累累，罢工不可能旷日持久。同时他们又在事先作了对付罢工的周密准备。十二家控制美国90％钢铁生产的公司彼此之间首先建立了“互助公约”，以后又在其他工业部门进行了战略部署，劝告所有用钢户，像汽车制造商、建筑业和仓库业等火速大量囤积钢材，以备不虞。7月15日罢工爆发时，美国各企业的钢铁存货达到二千四百八十万吨（美吨，下同）的高峰。钢铁大亨们还得到了政府当局和国会的支持和鼓励。艾森豪威尔总统一再附和他们的所谓增加工资会使物价上涨，造成通货膨胀的论调，打击钢铁工人增加工资的合理要求。国会议员们不断叫嚷要加强反劳工立法来压制工人。这都加强了钢铁公司的气焰。
    但是钢铁大亨们的全部如意算盘都落空了。“纽约时报”最近在一则通讯中承认，当罢工已达一百天的时候，“工会会员的斗志表现得比任何时期都更为坚决。工资的损失和他们家庭在衣食方面因收入中断而遭到的困难，都丝毫没有带来……打算屈服的迹象。恰正相反，在（钢铁）工厂附近的市镇中，普遍的情绪是宁肯‘永远不回去’也不让厂方得逞。”不仅如此，在钢铁工人罢工的同时，其他行业如铜业、造船、包装、海员、玻璃、纺织等部门的十几万工人，也为反对垄断资方加强剥削、拒不增加工资发动了罢工。他们同强大的钢铁工人汇合在一起形成了浩大的罢工怒潮。
    这次在美国历史上时间最长的钢铁工人大罢工，使美国垄断资本集团遭到沉重的损失。在一百一十多天中，全国三百一十个钢厂、一百一十八个开采铁矿砂的矿井因罢工而关闭。从东海岸到西海岸横越三十二个州的十一条运输线停顿了。汽车、造船、机器制造、铁路运输和电气工业因缺钢也纷纷减产，并使美国第三季的国民生产总值比第二季下降了三十五亿美元。据估计，钢铁公司在营业销售额上已损失了三十亿美元，并不得不眼睁睁地看着国内钢铁市场为外国钢铁公司所侵占。已经亏累很大的美国联邦政府的财政收入也因此损失了十二亿美元。同时，随着许多工业部门的减产，老板们大批解雇工人。截至上月21日止已有八十多万人（包括罢工者在内）被解雇。
    不仅如此，美国统治集团极为不安的是，他们不能不看到从来在工人运动中占据着举足轻重地位的钢铁工人，在这次罢工中加强了团结，提高了阶级觉悟，并促进了整个工人运动。在钢铁工人罢工中，越来越多的其他行业的工人兄弟发动了支援运动。煤矿工人、汽车工人、建筑工人和码头工人在这次斗争中都一致声援钢铁工人。在工人的压力下，“劳联—产联”也不得不设立了一项每月以三千万美元援助正在罢工的钢铁工人的特别基金。许多行业工人的罢工的不断发生，更是对钢铁工人罢工的有力支援。所有这些，对于处在最困难条件下斗争的美国工人运动，必将引起深远的影响。
    正是因为这样，艾森豪威尔总统在焦急不安中不得不慌忙抡起大棒，援引臭名远扬的塔夫脱—哈特莱法禁止罢工的规定，来解救钢铁垄断资本集团。当钢铁公司作了周密准备，认为一定可以压服钢铁工人的时候，美国总统曾装模作样地扮演“不干预”的角色，表示钢铁罢工是美国“自由民主”的表现，政府“不会谋求用下禁令的办法来结束全国性的钢铁罢工”。但曾几何时，当钢铁老板陷于穷境的今天，这位总统作为垄断资本集团的忠实奴仆的真面目就自行剥露了，代替所谓“自由民主”的漂亮言词的是大棒，是彻头彻尾的镇压！
    不过，美国总统求救于反劳工法，还不能真正为各大钢铁公司解决问题。因为钢铁大亨原来是要使工人屈服，接受老板加强剥削的新合同，但塔夫脱—哈特莱法只能强迫工人复工八十天，而工人们并未在资本家起草的合同上签字。这样，一则由于技术原因，各钢铁公司正常生产的恢复最早也要在复工之后一个月，因此实际上生产只能恢复六十天左右；二则，在被迫复工六十天之后，如果工人仍坚持罢工，那末，钢铁公司将受到更惨重的损失。正是由于这一点，钢铁老板在总统发出罢工禁令之后，发出了许多怨言，责怪总统没有能够帮忙得彻底。其实，这并不能怪总统，因为总统事先是曾估计到这一点，并作了许多的努力，暗中派遣副总统尼克松、劳工部长密契尔和最近出任调查委员会主席的“调解”劳资纠纷能手泰勒同“联合钢铁工人工会”主席麦克唐纳周旋，迫使工会让步。麦克唐纳也已答应把原来要求增加的工资降低三分之一，并放弃“缩短每周工作小时，工资照付”的条件，但是没有接受资方任意实行赶快制度、遣散工人的要求。因此，资方草拟的新合同仍未能签订。但就在现在，美国统治集团正扬言如工人在复工八十天后继续罢工，政府就要“强制接受”企业。美国政府是如何忠于垄断资本集团呀。
    由此可见，五十万钢铁工人大罢工给了美国钢铁大亨和美国政府多么大的打击，同时又多么无情地暴露了美国统治集团的窘态。这次美国钢铁垄断资本对钢铁工人的进攻，是美国资产阶级反劳工的一次恶毒步骤。9月5日的美国“民族”周刊指出，一年来美国“劳工几乎在所有的战线上都遭到它的敌人的日益频繁的攻击”，“情况几乎像战后初期的反共浪潮相似”。可是，也许是旁观者清，英国“经济学人”周刊不久前表示担心：美国钢铁大亨想在这次进攻中击溃工人运动，“不是一蹴就可以完成的”。其实，现在的结果比这位美国钢铁大亨的英国伙伴的喉舌担心的更为严重。这次钢铁工人的罢工斗争，对美国工人运动作出了重要的贡献。正如美国共产党名誉主席福斯特同志所指出的，这次钢铁罢工是一场决定性的斗争，它不但为自己而斗争，也是在为整个工人阶级而斗争。
