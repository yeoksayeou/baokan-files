Guizhou's High and Cold Mountainous Areas

The Bijie Special District in northwestern Guizhou Province includes nine counties: Bijie, Weining, Shuicheng, Dafang, Qianxi, Jinsha, and Hezhang. It is located on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and has many high mountains, which the local people habitually call Liangshan (Cool Mountains). Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County, located on the summit of Liangshan Mountain, is known as the "backbone" of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, with an altitude ranging from 1,500 meters to 3,000 meters.

The Bijie Special District is divided into three types of areas: Liangshan mountainous area, semi-Liangshan mountainous area, and Pingba (basins and plains). In Weining and other counties, mountainous areas account for the vast majority of the land. Due to the high terrain and low temperatures, the Liangshan area is also known as a high and cold mountainous area. For example, in Weining County, the average annual temperature is 11 degrees Celsius, the average temperature in July is 18 degrees Celsius, and the absolute minimum temperature in January is minus 12.4 degrees Celsius.

The mountainous area is rich in above-ground and underground resources, and there is a saying that "treasures are found everywhere in Liangshan." Crops include corn, potatoes, buckwheat, and oats. Local specialties include leather, lacquerware, and yellow pears. Weining ham and Zhijin stone inkstones are well-known far and wide. In particular, Yunnan pine and Huashan pine produced in the virgin forests are good materials for railway sleepers. Underground mineral resources such as coal, iron, lead, zinc, and copper are abundant.

However, before liberation, the Han, Yi, Hui, Gelao, and Buyi peoples living here lived miserable lives for generations because of backward production, years of natural disasters, and the long-term rule and oppression of the exploiting classes, who could not make good use of resources or resist natural disasters.

After liberation, the Party mobilized all ethnic groups in the region to organize mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives on the basis of democratic reform. Last year, people's communes were universally established, giving full play to the superiority of collective management, overcoming natural disasters, and exploiting mountain resources, quickly transforming the barren and high-cold mountainous areas into rich hometowns.

    贵州的高寒山区
    贵州省西北部的毕节专区，包括毕节、威宁、水城、大方、黔西、金沙和赫章等九个县。它地处云贵高原，有许多高大的山峰，当地人民习惯地称这些山为凉山。而座落在凉山山顶的威宁彝族回族苗族自治县，被人们称为云（南）贵（州）高原的脊背，海拔达一千五百米到三千米。
    毕节专区分为凉山区、半凉山区和平坝（盆地和平原）三种地区。在威宁等县境，山区占绝大部分地面。因地势高，气温低，人们又称凉山地区为高寒山区。如威宁县，全县年平均温度为摄氏十一度，七月份平均温度为摄氏十八度，一月份绝对最低温度为摄氏零下十二点四度。
    山区的地上地下资源很丰富，向有“凉山遍地宝”的说法。农作物有玉米、洋芋、荞麦、燕麦等。土特产有皮革、漆器和黄梨等，威宁的火腿，织金的石砚更闻名远近。特别是原始森林出产的云南松和华山松，是枕木的好材料。地下的煤、铁、铅、锌和铜等矿产，蕴藏丰富。
    但是，生活在这里的汉、彝、回、仡佬、布依等各族人民，在解放前，他们因为生产落后，连年天灾，再加上剥削阶级的长期统治压榨，不能很好利用资源，无法抗拒自然灾害，世代过着悲惨的生活。
    解放后，党发动全区各族人民，在民主改革的基础上组织互助组和农业生产合作社，去年又普遍建立了人民公社，充分发挥了集体经营的优越性，战胜自然灾害，发掘山区资源，很快就把贫瘠高寒的山区，改变为富裕之乡。（陆文璧）
