Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 19th: The Czechoslovak Party and Government Delegation, headed by Antonín Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and President of the Republic, arrived here by train this morning for a friendly visit to the German Democratic Republic.

The delegation is visiting at the invitation of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic. The delegation consists of eleven people, including Prime Minister Široký and Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the State Planning Commission Šimůnek.

Welcoming them at the station were leaders of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the state, including Ulbricht, Grotewohl, and Dieckmann. Diplomatic envoys from various countries to the German Democratic Republic also welcomed them at the station.

Thousands of Berlin residents gathered in the square in front of the station to welcome the distinguished guests.

Prime Minister Grotewohl delivered a welcoming speech at the rally, praising the achievements of the Czechoslovak people in socialist construction under the leadership of the Communist Party. He emphasized that the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia are bastions of the socialist camp in the West against West German imperialism and revanchism. Grotewohl said that a peace treaty with Germany must be concluded to stop the development of militarism and revanchism in West Germany.

Novotný spoke at the rally. He said that the delegation was visiting at a time when world public opinion was focusing its main attention on the issue of peaceful understanding. He emphasized that Khrushchev's speeches at the United Nations General Assembly and at the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union had opened up broad prospects for the cause of peace. He also expressed support for the German people's demand for the conclusion of a peace treaty and a peaceful resolution of the West Berlin issue.

Novotný condemned the propaganda in the Federal Republic of Germany that incited revanchist sentiments against Czechoslovakia, saying that such a policy ran counter to the trend of peaceful development.
