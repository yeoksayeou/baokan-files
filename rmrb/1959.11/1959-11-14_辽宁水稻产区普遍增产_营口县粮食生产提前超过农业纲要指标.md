Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang - Liaoning Province's 3.24 million mu of rice planted this year has yielded a bumper harvest. According to actual measurements and predictions from 16 key rice-producing cities and counties, including Yingkou, Liaoyang, and Xifeng, the average yield per unit area generally increased by more than 80% compared to last year, with 7 counties expected to see an increase of more than 100% in rice yield per unit area compared to last year.

As early as after last year's autumn harvest, Liaoning Province organized more than 400 agricultural cadres, commune leaders, and farmer technicians to visit and learn from the experiences of high rice yield. In winter, province-wide technical training sessions were held in batches. Subsequently, each county and people's commune launched universal technical training for all people, thereby fully preparing for high rice yields in terms of thought and technology. During spring planting, leadership over rice production was strengthened from top to bottom. In rice cultivation, all areas implemented yield-increasing measures such as close planting, deep plowing, and fertilization.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 12th - Yingkou County, Liaoning Province, has achieved a great bumper harvest in agricultural production this year. After repeated verification by the Yingkou County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the total output of the county's 500,526.1 mu of grain crops increased by 44.2% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, with an average yield of 537 jin per mu, exceeding the grain production targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program for areas south of the Yellow River, becoming the flag-bearer of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in Liaoning Province.

In order to realize the continued Great Leap Forward in agricultural production this year, the vast number of farmers in Yingkou County, after establishing people's communes last autumn, launched a new upsurge of water conservancy construction with the slogan "Ensure full seedlings without spring rain, ensure bumper harvest without rain all year round." In this work, the people of the county contributed more than 2 million workdays, completed 2.37 million cubic meters of earth and stone, and built countless reservoirs, river networks, deep wells, and various water conservancy projects such as diverting water up the mountains and creating ditch and ridge fields. Then, another 470,000 workdays were used to build a 40-li long water diversion project from the Hun River and Taizi River, solving the water usage problem for more than 180,000 mu of paddy fields in Gaokan Commune, Shuiyuan Commune, Xinsheng Farm, and the suburbs of Yingkou City. The work of implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture was also done relatively well in various places. Deep plowing was carried out on 60% of the county's cultivated land, and high-yield fine varieties such as "Weiguo" rice and "253" sorghum were vigorously promoted, with an average fertilization rate of 12,000 jin per mu. 58.4% of the county's grain crops were rationally and densely planted according to local conditions. Field management was also done very carefully. In addition, cadres at all levels and commune members also carried out large-scale experimental fields, command fields, high-yield squares, and created more than 30,000 mu of large-area high-yield rice fields with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, which played a significant role in improving the yield per unit area of grain crops this year.

At present, the people of Yingkou County, who have achieved a great agricultural harvest, are vigorously opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting their enthusiasm to strive for the continued Great Leap Forward in 1960, launching large-scale farmland capital construction. More than 60% of the county's cultivated land has been deep-plowed, and a magnificent water conservancy construction movement has also been launched vigorously.

    辽宁水稻产区普遍增产
    营口县粮食生产提前超过农业纲要指标
    据新华社沈阳讯　辽宁省今年播种的三百二十四万亩水稻获得丰收。据营口、辽阳、西丰等十六个水稻重点市、县的实打和预测，平均单位面积产量一般都比去年增产八成以上，其中有七个县的水稻单位面积产量可比去年增产一倍以上。
    早在去年秋收之后，辽宁全省就组织了四百多名农业干部、社长、农民技术员参观学习水稻丰产的经验；冬季，又分批举行了全省性的技术训练；接着，各县和各地人民公社都开展了全民性的技术普训，从而为水稻丰产在思想上和技术上做好了充分准备。春播中，从上到下都加强了对水稻生产的领导。在水稻栽培中，各地都贯彻执行了密植、深翻、施肥等增产措施。
    新华社沈阳12日电　辽宁省营口县今年农业生产获得大丰收。经过中共营口县委的反复核对，全县五十万零五千二百六十一亩粮食作物的总产量比大跃进的1958年增产44.2％，平均单位面积产量达到五百三十七斤，已超过了全国农业发展纲要规定的黄河以南的粮产指标，成为辽宁省农业生产大跃进的旗手。
    营口县广大农民为了实现今年农业生产继续大跃进，从去年秋天建立人民公社后，就在“一春无雨保全苗，一年无雨保丰收”的口号下挥锹抡镐掀起了新的水利建设高潮。在这一工作中，全县人民共付出二百多万个工日，完成土石方二百三十七万公方，兴修了无数的水库、河网、深井和引水上山、沟洫畦田等各种水利工程。接着又用四十七万个工日，修了一条长达四十里的浑（河）太（子河）引水工程，解决了高坎公社、水源公社、新生农场和营口市郊十八万多亩水田的用水问题。各地贯彻农业“八字宪法”的工作也做得比较好，全县60％的耕地都进行了深翻，大力推广了“卫国”水稻和“二五三”高粱等高产良种，平均每亩施肥一万二千斤。全县有58.4％的粮食作物，都因地制宜的进行了合理密植。田间管理工作也做得很精细。此外，各级干部和社员在今年农业生产中还大搞试验田、指挥田、丰产方、创造了三万多亩亩产千斤的大面积水稻丰产田，这对提高今年粮食作物的单位面积产量，起了重大的作用。
    目前，获得农业大丰收的营口县人民，正在大反右倾，大鼓干劲，为争取实现1960年的继续大跃进，展开了大规模的农田基本建设工作。全县的耕地已深翻了60％以上，波澜壮阔的水利建设运动也轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。
