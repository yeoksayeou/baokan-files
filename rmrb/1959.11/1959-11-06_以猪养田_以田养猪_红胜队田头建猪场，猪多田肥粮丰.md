From our Wuhan correspondent, November 5th: The Hongsheng Production Team of Herong Commune in Dangyang County, Hubei Province, has established pig farms in the fields, implementing the method of "raising pigs to nourish the fields and using the fields to raise pigs." This integrates the development of pig production with the establishment of fertilizer bases to transform backward fields. Not only has the team's grain and pig production achieved rapid development, but it has also turned remote fields into nearby fields, saving a great deal of labor in transporting fertilizer. The Dangyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has called on the entire county to emulate the Hongsheng Team in establishing pig farms in the fields, establishing fertilizer bases, and raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer.

The Hongsheng Production Team has abundant land but a shortage of labor. The team has 4,300 mu of paddy and dry land, with 405 laborers, averaging more than 10 mu of land per laborer. Due to insufficient labor, difficulties in transporting fertilizer, and a lack of fertilizer sources, crop yields were severely affected. For example, the team had 2,100 mu of remote fields, and the rice yield in 1958 was only 175 jin per mu, 275 jin less than the average yield of nearby fields. This year, after adopting the method of "zoning and fixing points, building farms in the fields, using the fields to raise pigs, and raising pigs to nourish the fields," the lean fields have been turned into fertile fields, and the remote fields have been turned into nearby fields. In less than a year, the backwardness of these 2,100 mu of land has been initially changed.

The method of "zoning and fixing points, building farms in the fields, using the fields to raise pigs, and raising pigs to nourish the fields" involves selecting suitable locations in remote fields to build pig farms, implementing pig raising in the fields, and using the accumulated manure to fertilize the nearby fields. At the same time, according to the standard of one mu of land for every 15 pigs, a portion of the surrounding area of each farm is designated as a feed base, planting various crops such as coarse grains, melons, and vegetables to solve the pig feed problem. This spring, the team successively established eight pig farms in four remote fields, allocated 74 mu of feed base, and raised a total of 883 pigs. To date, including the 243 pigs raised in the canteen and by individuals, the team has raised a total of 1,126 pigs (excluding the 455 piglets sold), an increase of 1.4 times compared to the 473 pigs raised throughout 1958. The team raised 227,000 dan of fertilizer by raising pigs, and most of this fertilizer was applied to the 2,100 mu of land. Despite more than 70 days of continuous drought this year, the yield of these 2,100 mu of land still reached 378 jin per mu, an increase of 203 jin per mu compared to last year, with a total increase in grain production of 426,300 jin. At the same time, this method has shortened the distance for transporting fertilizer and saved a large amount of labor. Previously, a laborer could only transport 9 dan of fertilizer a day, but now they can transport 50 dan. In the autumn harvest season alone, more than 10,000 labor days were saved in accumulating and transporting fertilizer. The team has decided to build five more farms in the fields this winter, and plans to develop another 600 to 800 pigs by the end of the year, and further increase to 3,000 to 4,000 pigs next year, basically achieving one pig per mu of land.

    红胜队田头建猪场，猪多田肥粮丰
    本报武汉5日电　湖北省当阳县河溶公社红胜生产队建立田头养猪场，实行“以田养猪、以猪养田”的办法，把发展生猪生产和建立肥料基地改造落后田结合起来，不仅使全队的粮食、生猪生产得到了飞跃的发展，而且还把远田变成了近田，节约了许多运肥的劳动力。中共当阳县委要求全县以红胜队为榜样，建立田头养猪场，建立肥料基地，养猪积肥。
    红胜生产队田多劳力少。全队有水旱田地四千三百亩，四百零五个劳动力，每个劳动力平均负担十亩多田。由于劳力不足，运肥困难和肥源缺乏，严重影响了作物的产量。例如队里有二千一百亩远田，1958年的稻谷单产只有一百七十五斤，比一般近田每亩要少收二百七十五斤粮食。今年采取“划片定点、田头建场、以田养猪、以猪养田”的办法后，把瘦田变成了肥田，把远田变成了近田，不到一年就初步改变了这二千一百亩田的落后面貌。
    “划片定点、田头建场、以田养猪、以猪养田”的办法，就是在远田里选择适中的地方建立养猪场，实行田头养猪，积的肥就近肥田。同时按每十五头猪一亩地的标准，在每个场的周围划出一部分饲料基地，种植杂粮瓜菜等各种作物，解决猪的饲料问题。这个队今年春天先后在四个远田里建立了八个养猪场，划出了七十四亩饲料基地，共养猪八百八十三头。到目前为止，加上食堂和私人喂养的二百四十三头，全队共养猪一千一百二十六头（出售的四百五十五头仔猪除外），比1958年全年养猪四百七十三头增长了一点四倍。全队养猪积肥二十二万七千担，这些肥料大部分都施到那二千一百亩田里。在今年连旱七十多天的情况下，这二千一百亩田单产还达到了三百七十八斤，比去年每亩增加了二百零三斤，共增产粮食四十二万六千三百斤。同时采取这个办法后，缩短了送肥距离，节省了大批劳动力。原来一个劳动力一天只能送肥九担，现在能送五十担，光秋收作物一季，就节省了积肥、送肥劳动力一万多个。这个队决定今冬再在田头建场五个，到年底前再发展生猪六百到八百头，并决定明年发展到三千头到四千头，基本上实现一亩田一头猪。
