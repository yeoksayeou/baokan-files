Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, November 4th: The Dalian Chemical Plant has successfully created a small-scale synthetic ammonia plant. Its annual production capacity is 800 tons, which can be processed into ammonia water or ammonium carbonate, sufficient to fertilize 200,000 mu of land, making it suitable for universal establishment by counties and people's communes.

This type of small-scale synthetic ammonia plant can easily choose a plant site. Its demand for water and electricity is not large, and the raw materials used are coke (local coke, anthracite can also be used) and air. In terms of China's current resource conditions, most regions are capable of building such plants.

The short construction period is the greatest advantage of this small plant. From commencement to production, it only takes three to five months. The investment is also very economical. According to calculations, the 900,000 yuan investment in building the plant can be compensated for within one year of production. The equipment it requires can be manufactured by general machinery factories in various provinces.

This plant only uses relatively simple methods and can process eight to ten tons of ammonia water per day. Compared with solid ammonium sulfate, this ammonia water is cheaper and has the same fertilizer effect. According to tests in Lüda and other places, applying 20 kilograms of ammonia water per mu can increase grain yield by more than 20%. The main disadvantage of ammonia water is that it is more troublesome to store and transport. Xin Jin County mobilized commune members to store and transport it separately, solving this difficulty. The commune members are all rushing to use ammonia water, saying, "Ammonia water is a treasure; wherever it is used, the crops are good."

The less ideal aspects of this type of small-scale synthetic ammonia plant are that the unit production cost and consumption quotas are higher than those of large-scale plants. The Dalian Chemical Plant and related scientific research departments are further improving it.

### 化工部推广大连小型合成氨厂好经验

    化工部推广大连小型合成氨厂好经验
    据新华社旅大4日电　大连化工厂成功地创建了一座小型合成氨厂。它的年产能力为八百吨，加工成氨水或碳酸铵，可肥二十万亩土地，适用于县和人民公社普遍举办。
    这种小型合成氨厂比较容易选择厂址。它对水和电的需用量不大，所用的原料是焦炭（土焦，无烟煤也可以）和空气。就我国目前的资源条件来说，大部分地区都能够建设。
    施工周期短是这种小厂的最大优点。从开工到生产，只要三、五个月。投资也很经济，据计算，建厂耗费的九十万元投资，在投入生产一年之内就可在收益中得到补偿。它所需要的设备，各省的一般机械厂都可承制。
    这个厂只采用比较简易的办法，每天就能加工八吨到十吨氨水。这种氨水同固体硫铵比较，价格便宜，肥效相等。据旅大等地试验证明，一亩地施用二十公斤氨水，粮食产量能提高20％以上。氨水的主要缺点是贮存、运输比较麻烦。新金县发动社员分散贮存和运输，解决了这个困难。社员们都抢着用氨水，他们说：“氨水是一宝，哪里用，哪里庄稼好”。
    这种小型合成氨厂，目前还不够理想的方面，是单位生产成本和消耗定额都高于大型厂。大连化工厂和有关科学研究部门正进一步改进中。
