　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 19th. The mass agricultural tool reform movement in Ningjin County, Hebei Province, has achieved great success. From January this year to the present, the county has transformed more than 878,000 pieces of various tools for farming, threshing, transportation, water conservancy, and rice and flour processing. This has increased the efficiency of related production links by one to twenty times, equivalent to an increase of 250,000 laborers, solving the county's labor shortage.

　　At the beginning of the tool reform in Ningjin County, some people had conservative ideas, believing that it must be done by formal factories, otherwise it would be a "waste of effort." Others only paid attention to producing "foreign" things and not "local" ones; they only focused on the big things and not the small ones. The Ningjin County Party Committee criticized these erroneous views, earnestly implemented the policy of "revamping the old and innovating," and, led by the County Party Secretary, boldly mobilized the masses, proposing the slogan "Everyone thinks, everyone studies, everyone contributes a skill." Through publicity, exhibitions, visits, and other methods, they mobilized skilled craftsmen and the broad masses of commune members to launch a vigorous mass movement to offer suggestions and ideas. In Sizhilan Commune, for example, the masses contributed 7,200 suggestions and ideas in the month of September alone.

　　In the tool reform movement, the county focused on 103 iron and wood factories, using methods such as learning from experience, experienced workers leading new workers, masters leading apprentices, visiting and learning, and mutual cooperation to tackle technical challenges. At the same time, the county successively held twelve selection meetings, and the masses evaluated and identified 35 kinds of improved and newly created agricultural tools. Through selection and experimentation, not only were techniques imparted, but it was also ensured that the improved tools were more practical.

　　In the process of improving and manufacturing tools, the county also mobilized the masses to rely on their own efforts, make use of whatever was available, and substitute wood for iron, solving the difficulty of raw material shortages. The masses used scrap steel and indigenous methods to make steel pipes, repairing and assembling more than 30 boiler-tractor units. They used wood to make more than 720 water pumps and more than 3,300 fast waterwheels, saving steel for the state and reducing the cost of tools.

　　In order to continuously push the mass movement of reforming tools to a new climax, many places have paid attention to timely promotion. The wooden horse-drawn water pump created by Wang Guozhen of Dongwang Commune, and the fast waterwheel and fast grinder created by Chengguan Commune, were praised by the masses as good tools, solving the most pressing problems of water lifting and rice and flour processing at the time. In addition to using comic strips to widely publicize and promote the above inventions, various communes also held more than 50 tool reform exhibitions, greatly boosting the confidence and enthusiasm of the masses, and quickly launching a "five-comparison" competition of comparing drive, studying, revamping, creating, and promoting, setting off a high tide of tool reform to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and strive for the top, making the tool reform movement rise one wave higher than another.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin. The Ministry of Agriculture recently held a national peanut, sweet potato, and cotton stalk pulling tool evaluation meeting in Ningjin County, Hebei Province, to evaluate and promote successfully tested new agricultural tools, calling on scientific research departments to combine with production, agricultural tool factories to closely combine with people's communes, to carry out mass agricultural tool reform on a large scale, to further implement the policy of "walking on two legs" in agricultural technology transformation, and to accelerate the progress of agricultural technology transformation.

　　More than 50 harvesting tools brought by major peanut, sweet potato, and cotton producing areas across the country participated in the evaluation. After more than three days of field testing and repeated research, fourteen agricultural tools were finally selected for recommendation nationwide. Among them, there were five peanut diggers from Tangshan and Ningjin in Hebei Province, and Huaiyin in Jiangsu Province; four sweet potato diggers from Tai'an in Shandong Province and Gongxian in Henan Province; and five cotton stalk pulling tools from Hebei, Gansu and other provinces. These machines are characterized by wide adaptability, simple structure, easy manufacturing or modification, low cost, convenient operation, high work efficiency, and good quality. The peanut and sweet potato diggers selected from Hebei, Shandong, Henan and other provinces are mostly modified from old-fashioned plows, walking plows, and double-wheeled double-share plows. The modification cost per unit is as low as two or three yuan and no more than thirty or forty yuan at most. They are pulled by one or two head of livestock, are easy to operate and stable. Generally, they can dig about ten acres of peanuts or fifteen to twenty acres of sweet potatoes per day, increasing work efficiency by more than ten times, and reducing peanut loss and exposing more sweet potatoes without damaging the potato blocks. The peanut harvester manufactured in Huaiyin City, Jiangsu Province, has been researched and improved for thirteen years and can be used for both animal traction and machine traction, with good results in harvesting creeping peanuts. The shovel-type cotton stalk machine manufactured by the Hebei Institute of Mechanization can shovel two rows at the same time, pulled by a tractor, and can harvest more than 100 acres of cotton stalks per day. Because the cotton shovel goes deep into the soil, it can also play the role of loosening the soil and cultivating. These machines also provide research directions for the combined mechanical operation of planting and harvesting crops such as peanuts, sweet potatoes, and cotton.

　　The selected agricultural tools include small improved agricultural tools that are easy to manufacture and solve current practical problems, as well as larger machines that need to be further studied in the future. There are agricultural tools improved or manufactured by people's communes and production teams, as well as semi-mechanized and machine-drawn agricultural tools made by scientific research departments, which fully embodies the victory of "walking on two legs" in agricultural technology transformation. More than 30 other agricultural tools, such as cotton boll shellers, threshers, and slicers, were also brought to the site. After on-site testing and visits, representatives from various regions exchanged drawings, put forward suggestions for improvement to each other, and formulated plans for learning and imitating, expressing that they must earnestly promote the use of these advanced agricultural tools.

　　The meeting criticized the erroneous ideas of some cadres who were waiting to realize agricultural mechanization and relaxing the reform of small tools, pointing out that the reform of agricultural tools and the production of semi-mechanized agricultural tools are still an important aspect of accelerating the "walking on two legs" of agricultural technology transformation. Ningjin County introduced at the meeting their achievements and experiences in earnestly implementing the policy of "revamping the old and innovating" and carrying out mass movements in agricultural tool innovation since this year. The meeting called on all regions to earnestly learn from the experience of Ningjin County, to further oppose right-leaning and encourage enthusiasm, to carry out mass tool reform movements, and to promote the use of advanced agricultural tools in accordance with local conditions.

　　This meeting lasted for four days. More than 230 representatives from agricultural halls, agricultural machinery bureaus, relevant people's communes, agricultural machinery production factories, and scientific research departments such as the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Mechanization from fourteen provinces and cities, including Guizhou, Sichuan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, participated in the meeting.

    农村工具改革百花盛开
    宁晋县“改旧创新”改制耕作、脱粒、运输、水利、加工工具八十多万件
    农业部评选十四件收获工具号召各地大力推广
    本报天津19日电　河北省宁晋县群众性农具改革运动取得很大成绩。从今年1月到现在，全县已改制耕作、脱粒、运输、水利、米面加工等各种工具八十七万八千多件，使有关生产环节的工效分别提高一倍到二十多倍，等于增加了二十五万个劳动力，使全县解决了劳动力不足的问题。
    宁晋县在开始进行工具改革时，有的人有保守思想，认为必须由正规的厂子来搞，否则是“白费劲”。也有的人只注意生产“洋”的，不注意搞“土”的；只抓大的，不抓小的。中共宁晋县委批判了这种错误的观点，认真贯彻“改旧创新”并举方针，由县委书记挂帅，放手发动群众，提出“人人想，个个钻，每人要献一手”的口号，通过宣传、展览、参观等方式，发动能工巧匠和广大社员，开展了一个轰轰烈烈的群众献计献策运动。其中四芝兰公社9月份一个月中，群众就献计献策七千二百条。
    在工具改革运动中，全县以一百零三个铁木厂为重点，通过取经学艺，老手带新手，师傅带徒弟，参观学习，互相协作等办法猛攻技术关。同时全县先后召开了十二次选型会议，经过群众评选鉴定了三十五种改良创制的新式农具。经过选型、试验，不但传授了技术，还保证了改良的工具更切合实际需要。
    在改良制造工具的过程中，全县还发动群众自力更生、因陋就简、以木代铁，解决了原材料缺乏的困难。群众用废钢铁土办法制成了钢管，修配了三十多台锅驼机；用木料制成了七百二十多台水泵和三千三百多台快速水车，给国家节约了钢铁，也降低了工具造价。
    为了把改革工具的群众运动不断推向新的高潮，很多地方都注意了及时推广工作。东汪公社王国振创制的木制马拉水泵，城关公社创制的快速水车和快磨，是群众赞扬的好工具，解决了当时提水、米面加工最迫切的问题。对以上的创造发明，除用连环图画广泛宣传推广外，各个公社还举办了五十多次工具改革展览会，大大鼓舞了群众的信心和干劲，使全县很快展开了一个比干劲、比钻劲、比改制、比创造、比推广的“五比”竞赛，掀起了学先进、赶先进、争上游的工具改革高潮，使工具改革运动一浪高过一浪。
    新华社天津电　农业部最近在河北省宁晋县召开全国花生、薯类、拔棉柴工具评选会议，评选和推广试验成功的新式农具，号召科学研究部门与生产结合，农具生产厂和人民公社密切结合，大搞群众性的农具改革，进一步贯彻农业技术改造两条腿走路的方针，以加速农业技术改造的进度。
    全国各主要花生、甘薯、棉花产区运来参加评选的收获农具有五十多件，经过三天多时间的田间试验和反复研究，最后评定向全国推荐的农具有十四件。其中有河北省唐山、宁晋和江苏省淮阴等地刨花生机五件；山东省泰安、河南省巩县的刨甘薯机四件；还有河北、甘肃等省拔棉柴农具五件。这些机具的特点是适应性广，结构简单，制造或改装容易，成本低，操作方便，工作效率高、质量好。评选出的河北、山东、河南等省的刨花生、甘薯机具，大都是用旧式犁、步犁、双轮双铧犁改制的，每部改装成本最低二、三元，最高不过三、四十元，用一头到两头牲畜牵引，操作轻便稳定，一般每天可刨花生十亩左右、刨甘薯十五到二十亩，比用人工刨挖提高工效十倍多，并且使花生丢失少、甘薯露薯多，不伤薯块，江苏省淮阴市制造的花生收获机，经过十三年的研究改进，能够畜引、机引两用，收获蔓生花生效果很好。河北机械化研究所制造的铲式棉柴机可同时铲两行，用拖拉机牵引，每天能收获一百多亩棉柴，由于棉铲入土深，还能起到松土中耕的作用。这些机器还为花生、甘薯、棉花等作物的耕种、收获联合机械作业提供了研究方向。
    评选出的农具，既有容易制造、解决当前实际问题的小型改良农具，也有今后还要进一步研究的比较大型的机器，有人民公社、生产队改良或制造的农具，也有科学研究部门制成的半机械化、机引农具，充分体现了在农业技术改造中两条腿走路的胜利。运来现场的还有棉桃脱壳机、打谷机、切片机等三十多种其他农具。各地代表经过现场试验、参观，纷纷交换图纸，互相提出改进意见，并且制定了学习仿造的计划，表示一定要认真推广使用这些先进农具。
  会议批判了某些干部等待实现农业机械化和放松小型工具改革的错误思想，指出今后农具改革和半机械化农具的生产，仍是加速农业技术改造两条腿走路的一个重要方面。宁晋县在会上介绍了他们今年以来，在农具革新中认真贯彻“改旧创新”并举方针和大搞群众运动的成绩和经验。会议要求各地认真学习宁晋县的经验，进一步反右倾、鼓干劲，开展群众性的工具改革运动，因地制宜地推广使用先进农具。
    这次会议开了四天。参加会议的有贵州、四川、湖北、安徽、江苏、河南、陕西、甘肃、山东、山西、河北、内蒙古自治区、北京、上海、天津等十四个省市的农业厅、农业机械局和有关人民公社、农业机器生产厂代表以及中国农业机械研究所等科学研究部门的代表共二百三十多人。
