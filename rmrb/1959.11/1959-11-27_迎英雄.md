    Welcoming Heroes
    Tian Zuoqin, Xianyang Ceramics Factory, Shaanxi

    The conference of heroes has concluded,
    Everyone shares their treasures and learns from experience.
    The heroes return from Beijing,
    Good news spreads throughout the city.
    Holding high the Party's red flag,
    Everyone learns from the heroes.
    When another conference is held next year,
    I too will go to Beijing.

    迎英雄
    陕西咸阳陶瓷厂　田作钦
    群英大会开过
    个个传宝取经
    群英北京归来
    喜讯传遍全城
    高举党的红旗
    人人学习英雄
    来年再开大会
    我也要去北京
