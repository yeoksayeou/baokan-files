Strengthen Plans to Conserve Grain; Diversify Melons and Vegetables to Improve Diet
Guangxi Farmers Save 30 Million Jin of Grain

(Reported by this newspaper) A new trend of diligence and thrift in managing households is taking shape in rural Guangxi. To date, about 70% of the production brigades in the entire autonomous region have formulated savings plans for every household, saving nearly 30 million jin of grain. At the same time, the entire autonomous region has planted 600,000 to 700,000 mu of autumn and winter melons and vegetables, and vegetable bases have been widely established in rural canteens to actively increase the production of non-staple foods.

After Guangxi's summer grain harvest, Party committees at all levels promptly called on people of all ethnic groups to be forward-looking and make up for deficiencies with surpluses, and to eliminate waste. Many people's communes have established grain management organizations at all levels, formulated grain saving covenants and systems, and strive to lay the foundation for year-round planned grain use from the very beginning. In the debates on issues such as "For whom are we saving grain?", "What are the benefits of saving grain?", and "Should we save grain in years of good harvest?" conducted in various people's communes, people of all ethnic groups enhanced their ideological understanding of diligence and thrift in managing households and building the country through diligence and thrift. The masses summarized the benefits of saving grain as: it can reduce the state's grain supply, sell more surplus grain to accelerate socialist construction; and it can also raise more poultry and livestock and expand sideline income. Saving grain benefits the country and oneself.

Now, the movement to save one liang of grain per person per day is sweeping the entire countryside. Not only are various effective measures such as eating dry food during busy farming seasons, eating thin porridge during slack seasons, mixing staple and coarse grains, and mixing grain and vegetables widely adopted, but the leadership of public canteens, grain warehouses, and grain processing departments has also been strengthened. Public canteens in the Wuzhou Special Zone have implemented the method of "rationing according to the person, setting targets for each household, storing grain in the canteen, eating with tickets, and returning savings to the commune members," implementing fine processing of coarse grains to ensure that the food is delicious. All grain warehouses adhere to the principle of allocating grain according to plan, weighing in and out, and keeping accurate records of income and expenditure, ensuring that there are no errors or omissions, and striving to become "four-without warehouses" this year. Grain processing units in rural areas of Guilin Special Zone actively improve tools to increase the grain output rate.

### 加强计划节约用粮　多种瓜菜改善伙食  广西农民省粮三千万斤

    增产粮食  计划消费
    加强计划节约用粮　多种瓜菜改善伙食
    广西农民省粮三千万斤
    本报讯　广西农村勤俭持家，节约粮食的新风气正在形成。到目前止，全自治区已有70％左右的生产大队家家户户订出了节约计划，节约出近三千万斤粮食。同时，全自治区已种下秋冬瓜菜六、七十万亩，各个农村食堂普遍建立了蔬菜基地，积极增产副食品。
    广西夏粮丰收后，各级党委就及时号召各族人民瞻前顾后，以丰补欠，杜绝浪费。许多人民公社层层设立粮食管理机构，制定节粮公约和制度，力求一开头就为全年计划用粮打下基础。在各人民公社开展的“为谁节约粮食”、“节约用粮有什么好处”、“丰收年景要不要节约”等问题的辩论中，各族人民对勤俭持家、勤俭建国提高了思想认识。群众总结出节约用粮的好处是：既可减少国家粮食供应，多卖余粮，以加速社会主义建设；又能多养禽畜，扩大副业收入。节约用粮是功在国家、利在自己。
    现在，每人每天节约一两粮食的运动席卷整个农村。各地不仅广泛采用农忙吃干、农闲吃稀、主杂粮搭配、粮菜混吃等多种有效措施，还加强了公共食堂、粮食仓库和粮食加工部门的领导。梧州专区各公共食堂都推行了“依人定量、指标到户、粮存食堂、凭票吃饭、节约归社员”的办法，实行粗粮细作，力求饭菜香味可口。各粮食仓库都坚持按计划拨付粮食，出入过秤，收支有据，保证不错不漏，力争在今年内全部成为“四无仓库”。桂林专区农村各粮食加工单位，积极改良工具，提高出粮率。
