The visiting team played a tight defense today. Although they were constantly attacked by the home team, they did not lose a point. In particular, the goalkeeper performed excellently, saving several dangerous shots.

The home team attacked fiercely today, penetrating near the visiting team's goal many times, but the players made too many passing errors, and their shots were not powerful enough, missing many good scoring opportunities.

    托木斯克人足球队同武汉队踢成平局
    新华社武汉18日电  苏联“托木斯克人”足球队今天下午在武汉体育场同武汉足球队举行的友谊比赛中，以零比零踢成平局。近两万观众观看了这场不分胜负的精彩球赛。
    客队今天防守严密，虽然不断受到主队的进攻，但总未失去一分，特别是守门员表演出色，救出了好几次险球。
    主队今天进攻很猛，多次攻入客队球门附近，但是队员传球失误比较多，射门也不够有力，失去了多次很好的得分机会。
    苏联“托木斯克人”足球队是17日由北京到达武汉的。
