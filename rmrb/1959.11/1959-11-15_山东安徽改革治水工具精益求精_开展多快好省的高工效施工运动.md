Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 14th – Shandong Province is extensively mobilizing the masses on various water conservancy construction sites, vigorously engaging in technical innovation, and launching a high-efficiency construction movement that is more, faster, better, and more economical, greatly accelerating the progress of projects.

The scale of water conservancy construction work in Shandong Province this winter and next spring is enormous. In order to complete the construction plan on time, many regions, under the slogan of "tools first, before men and horses move," are rushing to make and repair various tools for controlling mountains and rivers. Many tool factories have moved to water conservancy construction sites to serve the projects. Linqi Prefecture mobilized the masses to obtain materials locally, manufacture locally, and use them locally. By the end of October, they had made more than 14,900 meters of earth railway, more than 150 dump trucks, and more than 130,000 pieces of chisels, picks, iron bars, etc., and repaired more than 350,000 pieces of various tools, ensuring the needs of construction. Jining Prefecture laid more than fifty li of earth railway to improve the efficiency of earth transportation. Nearly 30,000 iron and woodworking craftsmen in Liaocheng Prefecture are working on various water conservancy construction sites to ensure that the tools of the migrant workers are repaired as soon as they are damaged.

Many water conservancy construction sites have put forward the slogan of "asking for labor from tools" and mobilized the masses to use their brains and vigorously engage in technical innovation. According to incomplete statistics, various regions have created and reformed dozens of tools such as "lifting and transporting soil devices," "double-line aerial soil transportation devices," "rope-traction flywheel climbing devices," "wooden wheel conveyor belt soil transportation vehicles," and "bow-shaped drilling machines." Using these tools generally increases efficiency by three to thirty times. Boxing County created the "single-pole soil transporter." Using this soil transportation tool, the amount of soil transported per person per day increased from the original three cubic meters to fifteen cubic meters. Zhao Fengqi of Dabu Commune in Shouzhang County created the "curtain-belt hand-cranked soil transporter," which transports 200 cubic meters of soil per day, increasing efficiency twenty times compared to manual labor. Workers at the Mishan Reservoir construction site in Yantai Prefecture created a group thunder cannon blasting method, which not only produced more and better stones, but also avoided the danger of flying stones. Workers in the construction site factory of the Wohushan Reservoir in Licheng County created the "mandarin duck dump truck," which increased soil transportation efficiency by thirty times compared to manual labor; the use of rolling tools to compact the dam at this construction site saved 250,000 labor days compared to manual compaction, which can greatly shorten the construction period.

On the basis of vigorously engaging in technical innovation, various water conservancy construction sites have mobilized the masses to carry out high-efficiency competition movements. After the Weishan Hub Project launched a high-efficiency competition between teams and individuals, red flag units continued to emerge, and the project progress rose in a straight line. After the competition, the amount of soil transported per person per day by the Fanxian migrant worker Yao Li Brigade increased from the original four cubic meters to seven cubic meters. The amount of soil transported per person per day by the Xutun Brigade of migrant workers in Chiping County increased from five cubic meters to 10.5 cubic meters, ranking among the best. All the migrant workers of the Jining Dingli Construction Corps on the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal project were full of fighting spirit and enthusiasm. In five days, they completed 15% of the task that would normally take fifty days. The Canal Headquarters immediately convened an on-site meeting to promote their experience. After the meeting, workers on various construction sites quickly launched a competition upsurge to learn from, catch up with, and surpass Dingli.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 14th – A mass movement to reform water conservancy tools is vigorously unfolding in various parts of Anhui. According to statistics at the end of October, the province has improved and manufactured more than two million various water conservancy tools of all sizes, and repaired a large number of tools.

Anhui Province has a very large task of water conservancy construction this winter. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a water conservancy meeting in early October. All regions seized the link of improving work efficiency and held research meetings on water conservancy tool reform, summing up the experience of carrying out high-efficiency water conservancy movements last winter and this spring. In order to achieve no shovels for digging soil and no carrying poles for transporting soil, party committees at all levels actively mobilized the masses and transferred a large number of iron, wood, bamboo, and stone workers to vigorously engage in technical innovation movements to repair, modify, manufacture, and create water conservancy tools. The Bengbu Prefecture has 1,971 professional teams (groups), with a total of 20,371 iron, wood, bamboo, and stone workers rushing to manufacture water conservancy tools. Since October, they have newly manufactured more than 200,000 various water conservancy tools. Mengcheng County, which started early and acted quickly, had newly manufactured more than 180,000 pieces and modified and repaired more than 58,000 pieces of water conservancy tools by November 2. The automatically loading and unloading soil transporter successfully created by the county is more than twenty times more efficient than manual loading and unloading. This soil transporter is operated by eight people, with a transportation distance of twenty meters and a climbing height of one to two meters, and the daily efficiency per person is more than 30 cubic meters. Various regions have also set up construction site factories in key water conservancy projects. For example, twelve counties including Wuwei and Hexian have organized technical cadres and workers with higher skills to set up camps on key construction sites, specializing in the manufacture of high-efficiency tools, making, using, and improving them at the same time, ensuring that they are truly usable and easy to use, and continuously improving them in practice.

At present, party committees at all levels are further doing a good job in sample selection and finalization by vigorously carrying out propaganda, organizing visits and study, and convening advanced tool performance meetings to help the masses become familiar with and master various advanced tools, so as to comprehensively promote them.

    山东安徽改革治水工具精益求精
    开展多快好省的高工效施工运动
    新华社济南14日电　山东省各水利工地广泛发动群众，大搞技术革新，开展多快好省地高工效施工运动，使工程进度大大加快。
    山东省今冬明春的水利兴修工作规模巨大。为了及时完成兴修计划，许多地区在“兵马未动，工具先行”的口号下，提早赶制和修理了各种治山治水工具，许多工具工厂搬上水利建设工地，为工程服务。临沂专区发动群众就地取材，就地制造，就地使用，到10月底止已制土铁轨一万四千九百多米，斗车一百五十多辆，钎子、洋镐、铁撬等十三万多件，还修理各种工具三十五万多件，保证了施工的需要。济宁专区为提高运土工效铺了五十余华里的土铁轨。聊城专区有近三万名铁木工人在各水利工地工作，保证民工的工具随坏随修。
    许多水利工地上，提出了“向工具要劳力”的口号，发动群众开动脑筋，大搞技术革新。据不完全统计，各地已创造和改革的工具有“升降运土器”、“双线空中运土器”、“绳索牵引飞轮爬坡器”、“木轮胶带运土车”、“弓形打井机”等几十种。使用这些工具，一般都能提高工效三倍到三十倍。博兴县创造了“单杠运土器”，使用这种运土工具，每人每天运土量由原来的三方提高到十五方。寿张县大埠公社赵凤启创造的“帘带式手摇运土器”，每天运土二百方，比人工提高工效二十倍。烟台专区密山大水库工地工人，创造了一种团雷炮爆炸法，不但打的石头多，打的好，还避免了石头乱飞的危险。历城县卧虎山水库工地工厂的工人，创造了“鸳鸯斗车”，运土工效比人工提高三十倍；这个工地采用碾压工具压碾大坝，比人工夯实节省二十五万个劳动日，能大大缩短工期。
    各水利工地在大搞技术革新的基础上，发动群众开展了高工效竞赛运动。位山枢纽工程开展队与队、人与人的高工效竞赛以后，红旗单位不断涌现，工程进度直线上升。范县民工姚立大队在竞赛后，每人每天运土量由原来的四方土提高到七方。茌平县民工徐屯大队每人每天运土量由五方提高到一○·五方，名列前茅。京杭大运河工程上的济宁町里施工团全体民工，个个斗志昂扬，干劲十足，五天的时间完成了五十天任务的15％，运河指挥部立即召开了现场会议，推广他们的经验。会后，各工地工人迅速掀起了学町里、赶町里、超町里的竞赛高潮。
    新华社合肥14日电　安徽各地群众性的治水工具改革运动正蓬勃展开。截至10月底统计，全省已改良和制造各种大小治水工具二百多万件，并修理了大批工具。
    安徽省今冬兴修水利的任务很大。中共安徽省委在10月上旬召开了水利会议，各地都抓住提高工效这一环节召开治水工具改革研究会议，总结去冬今春开展水利高工效运动的经验，为了做到挖土不用锹，运土不用挑，各级党委积极发动群众，抽调大批铁、木、竹、石工人，大搞治水工具的修、改、制、创的技术革新运动。蚌埠专区已有一千九百七十一个专业队（组），共二万零三百七十一个铁、木、竹、石工人赶制治水工具，从10月份以来，共新制各种治水工具二十多万件。动手早、行动快的蒙城县，到11月2日已新制了十八万多件和改修了五万八千多件治水工具。该县创制成功的自动装卸运土器比人工装卸效率提高二十多倍。这种运土器八人操作，运距二十米，爬高一至二米，每人日工效为三十多立方米。各地还在重点水利工程中，大办工地工厂。如无为、和县等十二个县都组织了技术较高的技术干部和工人到重点工地安营扎寨，专门制造高工效工具，边制、边用、边改进，作到确实能用和好用，并在实践中不断改良提高。
    目前，各级党委正通过大力宣传、组织参观学习、召开先进工具表演会等形式，进一步做好选样定型工作，帮助群众熟习和掌握各种先进工具，以便全面推广。（附图片）
