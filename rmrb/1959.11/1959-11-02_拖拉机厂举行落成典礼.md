Xie Juezai, President of the Supreme People's Court, with extremely excited mood, recited a poem at the meeting to congratulate the birth of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant.

Li Yu, Vice Minister of Agricultural Machinery, said in his speech that all the staff and workers on our agricultural machinery front must bravely undertake the glorious task of industry supporting agriculture and manufacture more and faster tractors and agricultural machinery to vigorously promote the technological transformation of agriculture.

Li Yu said that the current production of agricultural machinery should resolutely implement the policy of walking on two legs. On the one hand, we should vigorously organize the manufacture of modern agricultural machinery; on the other hand, we must continue to carry out mass agricultural tool improvement campaigns. In the next three or four years, the steps of agricultural mechanization should focus on improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools. With the further development of the agricultural machinery industry, through the development process from old to new, from low to high, from less to more, we will continuously expand the scope of use of modern agricultural machinery, and strive to basically realize agricultural mechanization nationwide in a short period of time, so that all land that can be cultivated by machines will be cultivated with tractors, and the main and most laborious agricultural manual labor will be replaced by machinery. This is a very glorious task. The completion and full commissioning of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant marks a new stage in China's agricultural machinery industry, and it will play a backbone role in the work of agricultural technology transformation.

Fu Ming, head of the Soviet delegation and Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, said at the meeting: "Please allow me, on behalf of the Foreign Economic Liaison Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers, the Soviet Embassy in China, and Soviet experts, to congratulate you on the new victory you have achieved in the cause of national industrialization." Fu Ming said: "China has been liberated for only ten years, but unprecedented changes have taken place in the appearance of your country and the lives of your people. The selfless labor of your people across the country has achieved fruitful results. Seeing that your new industrial enterprises are constantly being put into production and constantly achieving new technological achievements, the formerly backward country has quickly become a strong industrial power. The scale and speed of industrial development are increasing year by year. The great leap forward in economic construction in 1958 is the best foundation for the comprehensive leap forward in your country in 1959. The commissioning of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant is of great significance in realizing agricultural mechanization and agricultural technology revolution. The large tractors produced by this factory will reduce the heavy physical labor of Chinese farmers, and, to a large extent, accelerate the speed of your country's agricultural technology revolution. The First Tractor Factory is not only the newborn of China's tractor manufacturing industry, but also an advanced enterprise equipped with the latest technology. It is so encouraging that this factory has reached its designed production capacity when it started operation, and will greatly exceed it!"

Fu Ming said: "We are proud of your high evaluation of the technical assistance that the Soviets have provided in China's construction."

Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation and Minister of Health, He Jifeng, Vice Minister of Agriculture, Liu Yumin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, Xu Guangda, Vice Minister of the Ministry of National Defense, Xu Zhizhen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Shi Zhiren, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, and Zhang Chao, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, also spoke at the meeting successively. They warmly congratulated the successful completion and commissioning of the tractor factory.

He Jifeng, Vice Minister of Agriculture, said in his speech that after the people's commune, the scale of organization is larger, the scope of production is wider, the degree of collectivization is higher, and public accumulation is greater, and the production and construction of the entire commune can be planned in a unified way. All of these are conducive to accelerating the process of agricultural mechanization and electrification, conducive to giving full play to the efficiency of agricultural machinery, and conducive to realizing agricultural mechanization. He said that the Luoyang First Tractor Manufacturing Plant will definitely produce more and better Dongfanghong tractors at a faster speed to support the technological transformation of agriculture, so as to accelerate the process of agricultural mechanization and electrification of the great motherland.

Also speaking at today's meeting were Ji Wenfu, Vice Governor of Henan Province and President of Zhengzhou University, Daochinko, leader of the Soviet expert group that helped build the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, Ji Dengkui, First Secretary of the Luoyang Prefectural Party Committee of the CPC, Lü Ying, First Secretary of the Luoyang Municipal Party Committee of the CPC, representatives of the Third Construction Company of Henan Province, representatives of suburban farmers, and representatives of workers and engineering technicians from the tractor factory. At today's meeting, congratulatory telegrams and letters from eleven units such as the Kharkov Tractor Factory in the Soviet Union and more than 70 units such as the Industrial Department of the CPC Central Committee, the State Economic Commission, the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, and the Ministry of Agricultural Machinery were also read out.

At the inauguration ceremony, the staff and workers of the First Tractor Factory also passed a letter of respect and good news to Chairman Mao and a letter of good news to the National Conference of Heroes. In their letter of good news to Chairman Mao, they said: "The victorious completion of the First Tractor Factory is the result of the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and you, the victory of the Party's general line, and the victory of the Great Leap Forward. It is also the crystallization of the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union. The First Tractor Factory was born at the beginning of China's modern large-scale agricultural construction, which makes us feel more deeply the arduousness and glory of our task. This glorious task is given to us by the Party and you, and by the people of the whole country. We assure you: we will never fail to live up to your care and hope and that of the people of the whole country, and we will immediately devote all our efforts to the battle to support agricultural mechanization, resolutely and higher hold high the red flag of the general line, thoroughly oppose rightism, go all out, adhere to political command, launch mass movements, and engage in technical innovation and technical revolution in a big way, ensure that we complete this year's national plan one month ahead of schedule, and make all preparations for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward next year, produce a large number of high-quality tractors for the country, and make greater contributions to agricultural mechanization." In their letter of good news to the National Conference of Heroes, they said: "We will definitely humbly learn from your experience, learn from your lofty communist style and high revolutionary drive, and dedicate our greatest strength to supporting agricultural technological transformation and supporting the continued great leap forward in agriculture."

At the meeting, silk banners were also presented to Soviet factories and design units that supported the construction of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant.

After the meeting, Tan Zhenlin, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, cut the ribbon.

In the afternoon, Comrade Tan Zhenlin and heads of various central departments inspected the workshop. The workers of the whole factory started various machines quickly with excited hearts. The 222 production lines were like gurgling streams, and finally converged into a turbulent river—the final assembly line. After the closing of the ceremony, the workers here went to prepare tools and parts. Every worker was like an artilleryman guarding his gun position, waiting on both sides of the final assembly line. On this day, they decided to assemble fifteen tractors in four hours, with the highest speed and the most outstanding results, to celebrate the birth of their factory.

In order to celebrate the successful completion of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant held a grand banquet at the Luoyang Friendship Hotel tonight.
