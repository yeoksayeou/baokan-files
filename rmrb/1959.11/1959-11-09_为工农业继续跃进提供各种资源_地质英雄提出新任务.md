Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The 103 representatives attending the National Advanced Experience Exchange Conference of the Geological System of the National Heroes Congress, after exchanging experiences by profession, today issued a competition proposal to the staff and workers on the national geological front. They guaranteed to complete this year's geological exploration tasks ahead of schedule and over fulfill them, and to make all preparations for the continued leap forward next year, so as to provide the various mineral resources needed for the continued leap forward in industry and farmland water conservancy.

In recent days, the representatives have enthusiastically and conscientiously "contributed treasures" and "learned from experience." Through medium-sized meetings and group meetings, they meticulously exchanged experiences in four majors: geology, drilling, mountain, and machinery. There were enthusiastic speeches at the group meetings, and the representatives contributed a total of more than 200 experiences. When they spoke, they mostly drew detailed pictures and introduced them bit by bit.

Many of the experiences exchanged by the representatives at the meeting are of great significance for solving the key problems in the current geological work, and have attracted the universal attention of the representatives. In terms of geological exploration, the rapid exploration method of the Niuwan Iron Mine in Dengfeng, Henan, and the rapid prospecting method of the Erfengshan Iron Mine in southern Jin, Shanxi, were unanimously praised by the representatives, and everyone said that they would promote them according to local conditions after returning. The representatives of the mountain group carefully listened to the speech of Tao Junqin from the Guangdong 703 Team. Tao Junqin's mountain team vigorously carried out technical innovations, reduced heavy physical labor, created "thousand-meter adits" and "ten-thousand-cubic-meter trenches" per month, and increased efficiency by four to fifteen times, completing one year and seven months of work in two months. They are the first advanced collective on the national geological front to break through thousand-meter adits and dig ten-thousand-cubic-meter trenches. Guo Cai, a representative of the Henan Yu○6 Team, specifically introduced their experience in safe production without accidents for three years and six months at the meeting. The representatives from the drilling aspect concentrated their efforts on studying how to break through hard rock formations and complex rock formations. Wang Guoyi, the hero who fought the Battle of Agate Mountain, introduced his drilling experience. The representatives of the Youth Leap Forward drilling rigs from Sichuan and Anhui respectively introduced their experience in achieving high-yield and high-quality breakthroughs in ten-thousand-meter drilling. The representatives of the machinery group were all skilled craftsmen. They carefully studied the experience in equipment maintenance, saving raw materials, and making substitutes. Wu Xueliang, a technical innovation expert from the Guizhou Fanjingshan Geological Team, has been innovating every month and creating every year for the past three years. He introduced his experience in making steel abrasive cutting machines and experimenting with using wooden sleeves instead of copper sleeves. Tan Ailan, a female turner from Hengyang Prospecting Machinery Factory, talked about her experience in manufacturing diesel engine fuel injectors by combining indigenous and foreign methods. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by the representatives.

In addition to studying specific experiences in production technology and operation, the representatives also exchanged experiences on putting politics in command and carrying out mass movements. From their personal experience, they deeply realized that all achievements in their work are inseparable from the leadership of the Party, putting politics in command, and carrying out mass movements on a large scale.

During the meeting, Minister of Geology Li Siguang and Vice Minister Liu Hansheng spoke to the representatives, and Vice Minister He Changgong made a report on "The Current Situation of Geological Work and the Tasks for 1960." Zheng Jinghua, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Geological Trade Union, also spoke at the meeting. They encouraged the representatives to conscientiously implement the spirit of the National Heroes Congress, not to be arrogant or complacent, to work hard, and to always advance with the masses.

    为工农业继续跃进提供各种资源
    地质英雄提出新任务
    据新华社7日讯　参加全国群英大会地质系统先进经验交流会的一百零三位代表，在按专业交流经验之后，今天向全国地质战线上的职工们发出了竞赛倡议。他们保证提前超额完成今年的地质勘探任务，并为明年继续跃进做好一切准备工作，以提供工业和农田水利继续跃进所需要的各种矿产资源。
    连日来，代表们热忱认真地“献宝”、“取经”。他们通过中型会议和小组会，分地质、钻探、山地、机械四个专业细致地交流了经验。小组会上发言踊跃，代表们一共献出了二百多条经验。他们在发言时，大都绘出详细的画图，一点一滴地作介绍。
    代表们在会上交流的经验，有不少对于解决当前地质工作中的关键问题，具有十分重要的意义，引起代表们的普遍重视。在地质勘探方面，河南登封牛湾铁矿的快速勘探法，和山西晋南二峰山铁矿的快速普查法，受到代表们一致的赞许，大家都表示回去以后要因地制宜地加以推广。山地组的代表们，认真听取了广东七○三队陶俊琴的发言。陶俊琴山地小组大搞技术革新，减轻了笨重的体力劳动，月创“千米硐”和“万方槽”，提高效率四倍到十五倍，两个月做完了一年零七个月的工作。他们是全国地质战线上第一个大破千米硐、挖开万方槽的先进集体。河南豫○六队的代表郭才，在会上具体介绍了他们三年零六个月无事故的安全生产经验。钻探方面的代表们，集中力量研究了如何突破坚硬岩层和复杂岩层的问题。大战玛瑙山的英雄王国驿，介绍了自己的钻进经验。四川和安徽的青年跃进号钻机的代表，都分别介绍了突破万米钻的高产优质经验。机械组的代表一个个都是能工巧匠。他们仔细研究了设备保养维修、节约原料材料、自制代用品等方面的经验。贵州梵净山地质队技术革新能手伍学良，三年来月月有革新，年年有创造。他介绍了自己制成钢粒切割机和试验以木套代铜套的经验。衡阳探矿机械厂女车工谭爱兰谈了用土洋结合的办法制造柴油机喷油嘴的经验。他们的发言，受到代表们的热烈欢迎。
    代表们除了研究生产技术操作方面的具体经验以外，还交流了关于政治挂帅、开展群众运动的经验。他们从亲身体验中，深刻地认识到，工作上所有的成绩，都是和党的领导、政治挂帅、大搞群众运动分不开的。
    会议期间，地质部部长李四光、副部长刘汉生向代表们讲了话，副部长何长工作了“地质工作当前情况和1960年任务”的报告。中国地质工会全国委员会主席郑晶华也在会上发了言。他们鼓励代表们认真贯彻全国群英大会的精神，不骄傲不自满，鼓足干劲，永远和广大群众一起不断前进。
