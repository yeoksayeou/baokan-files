    Here is the Headquarters of the Revolution
    Soviet Union Dé Mǎmǔléiyēfū
    Autumn, the leaves are about to fall. Golden-red leaves cover the ground with a blanket as red as fire. The water jets of the fountains are gone...
    Autumn has come to the beautiful park near the Smolny Palace. The autumn in Leningrad is not very cold, but it is not warm either. Fluffy white clouds fly low in the sky, almost touching the delicate dome of the Smolny Palace; gusts of fresh wind from the Baltic Sea carry the salty taste of the sea and the smoke from the shipyards. After the misty morning passes, sometimes there is a clear sunny day...
    The Smolny Palace is adorned with autumn's golden necklace. It stands there solemnly and majestically, attracting people and arousing memories of the October Revolution of 1917.
    From the Square of the Dictatorship to the palace with its colonnades, the wide boulevards are filled with pedestrians. These are the people going to pay homage to the Lenin statue. The Lenin statue, standing in front of the central colonnade, vividly shows his spirit. He raises his arm and shouts as if uttering this slogan:
    "Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!"
    People come here from far and near on the Earth, with sincere respect, to this place where the revolutionary heart began to beat passionately forty-two years ago.
    The storm of the October Revolution has long subsided, but it seems like it was not long ago! Forty-two years have changed the face of the Earth, angered the old world, and reversed people's consciousness. But this storm that sweeps everything and eliminates all filth does not damage our memory of the stormy events of October in the slightest. All the scenes are still so dear...
    Smolny Palace, your walls and bricks still remember all this!
    Over here, on the steps, are machine guns; over there, not far from the gate, are armored vehicles; next to the three-inch field gun is a pile of wood for building barricades. From every corner of the city, from the working-class districts shrouded in the night, messengers rush here, carrying machine-gun belts crisscrossed on their bodies, with bombs and grenades hanging from them. Sailors' uniforms, soldiers' greatcoats; bearded men who came out of the trenches, young men with bloodshot eyes from sleeplessness; red ribbons and streamers on hats, red armbands on leather jackets... Under the flickering lights of the searchlights, in the firelight of the smoky bonfires, all this is mixed and interwoven...
    In this surging crowd, everyone is rushing somewhere, some are greeting someone, some are giving urgent tasks to someone, but few people notice a short and sturdy man. His face is wrapped in black gauze, he wears a wig, and on top of it is an old and oily peaked cap. Who knows that in the Vyborg district, in a small house where he safely avoided secret agents and spies, the hostess is now reading the little note left by this man: "I'm leaving, to a place you don't want me to go. Goodbye. Ilyich."
    With his agile and vigorous steps, he ascended to the third floor of the Smolny Palace, intending to lead the uprising from here.
    The arched corridors, wide stairs, and quiet offices of the Smolny Palace... Where are rooms seventy-five and seventy-six, where all the clues for leading the uprising were concentrated? Time has erased the numbers on the doors. But when you walk into this antique building, shrouded in the glory of the past, you will feel as if this secluded door is about to open, and Ilyich, whose gait and demeanor are familiar to us, will walk out. He squints his eyes, puts his hands in his vest, stands among the soldiers and workers, in order to talk to them, chat with them, and shake their weathered and rough hands.
    On the left, there is a room with a sign that says "Female Class Instructor." Lenin walked in. This was his office, where the first decrees on peace, land, and power were born, where the Council of People's Commissars held meetings, and where delegations of workers, soldiers, sailors, and peasant representatives were so numerous that one could not attend to them all.
    The Smolny Palace of that year has been praised by poets. Many novels have described it. However, when you stroll through its corridors and are seized by a strong and uplifting emotion, you can't help but think of something else: short articles written by witnesses, oral accounts of eyewitnesses.
    "When you are caught in this torrent," Lunacharsky wrote, "you will see around you enthusiastic and excited faces and arms stretched out to receive some instruction or commission.
    "Major tasks are being deployed here, major appointments are being decided, typewriters are clattering incessantly, people are signing orders on their knees with pencils, and then a young comrade, fortunately accepting the task, is speeding in a racing car through the night. In the last room, several comrades, as if transmitting electric current, are issuing orders to the Russian cities that are uprising in all directions without leaving their homes."...
    There are several large and small assembly halls in the Smolny Palace. But among them, there is one hall whose countless paintings and photos are familiar to everyone. Sunlight pours in from the large windows, illuminating the neat white columns on both sides of the hall, making them particularly clear. Two rows of columns lead directly to the high stage. In the past, this was where the students of the Noble Maidens Institute held gatherings on festive occasions. Now, a huge portrait of Ilyich hangs on the stage. He is standing there in his coat, wearing a plain peaked cap, against the background of the first power station built according to the famous electrification plan—the Volkhov Hydroelectric Station. You feel that the leader is about to walk out of the painting and into the hall, and a huge wave of applause and cheers will rush towards him, just like on that unforgettable night.
    A table covered with red felt, next to which stands the leader of the revolution, a modest, simple and great man, holding a watch in his hand. He looks at the watch as if to say to the delegates of the Second Soviet Congress who are welcoming him: Time is precious, let's get to work.
    The telephone rang constantly in the office, the telegraph machine rattled, and reports kept coming: the cruiser "Aurora" opened fire on the Winter Palace; the Winter Palace was captured; the members of the Provisional Government were arrested...
    And from here, from the White Column Hall, came a profound sentence: "From now on, all power to the Soviets."
    10:45 PM...
    October 25th was the first day, the first day of the new world...
    Here, in this hall, the voices of the people are loud and incessant. It seems that the entire Russia has gathered in this hall to hear the announcement of the historically significant Land Decree and Peace Decree, and to organize the government of the dictatorship of the proletariat—the Council of People's Commissars headed by Lenin.
    Red clouds shine over the Smolny Palace... the heart of the revolution beats tirelessly...
    All this feels dear and familiar.
    When you cross the threshold of Lenin's residence and enter the small room separated by thin boards, you will see how simple the furniture and furnishings that the revolutionary leader came into contact with daily are, and memory will tell you that here, in this residence, he pondered the future, using the keen eyes of a philosopher, an idealist, and a warrior to perceive many years later.
    Here, in the Smolny Palace, the "Declaration of Rights of the Laboring and Exploited People" was born, and decrees on the abolition of ranks and civil service titles, news publishing, revolutionary courts, the establishment of the Red Army, etc., were drafted... Here, the foundation for the most just and principled national policy was laid...
    Here began the socialist transformation of the economy... Here...
    How many major events occurred here in the first difficult months after the establishment of Soviet power...
    Forty-two autumns have passed...
    Distant and dear years...
    Despite the changing times, and the passing years bringing ever-changing achievements to the people of the Soviet state, the image of the Smolny Palace—an impregnable fortress, Lenin's headquarters—will never disappear from people's memory.
    The Smolny Palace... On the Leningrad city map, it is just a small dot. However, the red flag that first fluttered over it in October 1917 has been gazed upon all over the world. This is a flag stained with the blood of warriors, a proud and inspiring socialist flag.

    这里是革命的大本营
    苏联  德·马姆雷耶夫
    秋天，树叶快要落尽。金红的叶子给地上铺上了一张红似火的毯子。喷水池的水柱已经不见了……
    秋天来到了斯摩尔尼宫附近这座美丽的公园。列宁格勒的秋天不很冷，可也不暖和。朵朵低飞的白云从空中飘过，几乎擦着斯摩尔尼宫透花的圆顶；从波罗的海刮来的阵阵清风送来大海的咸味和造船厂的烟气。等到朝雾弥漫的清晨一过，有时会出现晴空万里的艳阳天……
    斯摩尔尼宫挂上了秋天的金项链。它庄严雄伟地屹立在那里，吸引着人们，激起人们对1917年十月革命的回忆。
    从专政广场到带有柱廊的宫殿，宽宽的林荫道上，过路行人川流不息。这是去拜谒列宁铜像的人群。矗立在中央柱廊前面的列宁铜像神彩毕现，他振臂高呼，好像喊出这个口号：
    “无产阶级专政万岁！”
    人们从地球远处和近处，带着虔诚的敬意来到这里，这四十二年前革命心脏开始热情跳动不息的地方。
    十月革命的风暴早就停息了，可是它又像是不久以前的事！四十二年的岁月改变了地球的面貌，激怒了旧世界，扭转了人们的意识。但是这席卷一切、扫荡万污的风暴并丝毫无损于我们对十月事变暴风雨的记忆，它的一切情景还是那么亲切……
    斯摩尔尼宫，你的宫墙和砖石还记得这一切！
    靠这边，台阶上，摆着机枪；靠那边，离大门不远的地方，停着装甲车；在三英寸口径野炮的旁边摆着一堆供搭街垒的木材。从全城各个角落，从被夜幕笼罩的工人区，通信员纷纷赶到这里，他们身上十字交叉地背着机枪子弹带，挂着炸弹和手榴弹。水兵的服装，士兵的军大衣；从战壕里走出来的大胡子，由于不眠而眼睛充满血丝的小伙子；帽子上的红绸条和绸带，皮夹克上的红臂章……在探照灯忽明忽暗的灯光下，在青烟缭绕的篝火的火光中，这一切都混杂交织在一起……
    在这激荡着的人流里，大家都匆忙赶赴某地，有的在迎接某人，有的在向某人交代紧急任务，但是，却很少有人注意到一个身材矮小而结实的人。他脸上缠着黑纱，头上带着假发，上面带着一顶破旧而又沾满油污的鸭舌帽。有谁知道，在维堡区，一个安全地避开密探和奸细的小住宅里，女主人此刻正在读着这个人留下的小小便条：“我走了，到您不想叫我去的地方。再见。伊里奇。”
    以他捷敏、刚健的步子登上了斯摩尔尼宫的三楼，打算从这里领导起义。
    斯摩尔尼宫的拱形长廊，宽宽的阶梯，静静的办公室……当年集中了起义领导全部线索的七十五号和七十六号房间在哪儿呢？岁月抹去了门牌上的号码。但是，当你走进这座古色古香，被昔日光荣笼罩着的大厦时，你会觉得，好像这扇幽闭着的门就要敞开，从里面走出步态举止都为我们所熟悉的伊里奇。他眯缝着眼睛，手插进坎肩里，在士兵和工人群众中间站下来，为的是跟他们谈谈话，聊聊天，握握他们饱经风霜、皮肤粗糙的手。
    靠左边有一个挂着“女班训导员”牌子的房间，列宁走了进去。这是他的办公室，这里诞生了第一批关于和平、土地和政权的法令，这里曾举行过人民委员会会议，这里的工人、士兵、水兵代表团和农民代表曾多得叫人应接不暇。
    当年的斯摩尔尼宫已被诗人歌颂过了。多少长篇小说描写过它。然而当你漫步在它的走廊而被一种强烈昂扬的感情占有时，不由得想起别的东西：见证人写的短文，目击者的口述。
    “当你被卷进这股激流时，”卢纳察尔斯基写道，“会看到周围都是热情激昂的脸孔和为接受某种指示或委任书而伸出的手臂。
    “这里在部署重大的任务，决定重大的任命，打字机不住声地响着，人们用铅笔在膝头上签署命令，于是有一个青年同志，幸运地接受了任务，在黑夜里乘着狂奔的汽车飞驰。在最后一个房间里，有几个同志，好像输送电流似的，足不出户地向四面八方起义的俄国城市发出命令。”……
    斯摩尔尼宫里大小会堂有好几个。但是其中有一个会堂，它那无数的绘画和照片都是大家所熟悉的。阳光从宽大的窗子洒落进来，把大厅两旁整齐的白柱子照得格外显明。两排柱子直通到高高的舞台上。从前这里是贵族女子学院学生在喜庆节日举行集会的地方。现在，舞台上挂着伊里奇的巨幅画像。他穿着外套，带一顶朴素的鸭舌帽站在那里，背景是根据有名的电气化计划建设的第一个电站——沃尔霍夫水电站。你觉得，领袖眼看就要从画里走出来，步入大厅，一股掌声和欢呼声的狂涛巨浪向他猛地冲过去，就像在那个难忘的夜晚一样。
    一张铺着红毡的桌子，旁边站着革命领袖，一位谦逊、纯朴而伟大的人，他手里拿着一只表。他看着表，好像对欢迎他的第二次苏维埃代表大会代表们说：时间宝贵，我们着手工作吧。
  办公室里不断地传来电话铃声，电报机哒哒地响着，报告不断传来：“阿芙乐尔号”巡洋舰向冬宫开炮了；冬宫攻下来了；临时政府的成员被逮捕了……
    而从这里，从白柱大会堂里，传来一句寓意深远的话：“从现在起全部政权归苏维埃”。
    二十二点四十五分……
    10月25日是第一天，新世界的第一天。……
    这里，这座会堂里，人声鼎沸，经久不息。好像整个俄国都聚集在这个大厅里来听取宣告具有历史意义的土地法和和平法，组织无产阶级专政的政府——以列宁为首的人民委员会。
    红霞照在斯摩尔尼宫的上空，……革命的心脏永不止息地跳动着……
    这一切都令人感到亲切、熟悉。
    当你跨过列宁住宅的门槛，走进用薄板隔起来的小房间时，你会看到革命领袖日常接触的家具陈设有多么朴素，记忆会告诉你，在这里，就在这所住宅里，他曾思考未来，用哲学家、理想家和战士的慧眼洞察许多年以后。
    在这里，斯摩尔尼宫里，诞生了“劳动者和被剥削人民的权利宣言”，起草了关于取消等级和文职官衔、新闻出版、革命法庭、建立红军等法令……在这里奠定了最公正和原则性最强的民族政策基础……
    在这里开始了按照社会主义改造经济……在这里……
    在苏维埃政权成立最初的艰苦的几个月里，这里曾发生过多少大事件……
    四十二个秋天了……
    遥远而又亲切的年代……
    尽管岁月交替，一年年逝去，为苏维埃国家人民带来日新月异的成就，但是，斯摩尔尼宫——攻不破的堡垒、列宁的大本营——的形象永不会从人们记忆中消失。
    斯摩尔尼宫……在列宁格勒的市区图上，它也不过是一个小小的点。但是，1917年10月最先在它的上空飘扬起的一面红旗，已为全球各地所举目瞻望。这是勇士的鲜血染红的旗帜，是一面骄傲的、具有号召力的社会主义旗帜。
