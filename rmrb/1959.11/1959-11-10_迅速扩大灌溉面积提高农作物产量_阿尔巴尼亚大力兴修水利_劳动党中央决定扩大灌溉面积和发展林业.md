Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 8th – The Albanian Labor Party Central Committee plenary session held from November 2nd to 3rd unanimously adopted two resolutions: a resolution on expanding irrigated area and improving irrigation technology; and a resolution on developing forestry and rationally using and saving wood.

The resolution on expanding irrigated area and improving irrigation technology instructs Party committees at all levels, executive committees of each state, and agricultural departments to lead the broad masses of farmers in constructing water conservancy projects and improving irrigation technology in order to rapidly expand irrigated area and increase crop yields.

According to the plan, Albania will add 96,000 hectares of irrigated land in the next six years. The proportion of irrigated area to the country's total cultivated area will increase from 27.6% in 1938 to 39.9% in 1965. In order to complete this massive task, the Central Committee plenary session called on farmers across the country to fully utilize water sources and build local irrigation projects capable of irrigating more than 41,000 hectares of land.

The resolution on developing forestry and rationally using and saving wood adopted by the Central Committee plenary session pointed out that Party committees at all levels and the broad masses of people, especially the peasant masses, should accelerate the development of the forestry economy. In addition to cultivating, improving, and protecting forests, attention should be paid to rationally harvesting timber and saving fuel wood.

The resolution called on farmers to plant more economically valuable reeds and to experiment with planting bamboo.

In the fifteen years since liberation, Albania has added more than 13,500 hectares of new cultivated land, improved more than 55,000 hectares of soil, and increased irrigated area by 73,000 hectares. In 1958, the country's irrigated area was one and a half times larger than in 1938.

Albania is one of the countries rich in forests, with the total area covered by forests accounting for 47% of the country's area. In Europe, it ranks third only after Finland and Sweden. Calculated per capita, Albania has 53.6 cubic meters of forest per person. In the past fifteen years, Albania has planted a total of 17,000 hectares of forests, and 57,000 hectares of forests have been improved.

    迅速扩大灌溉面积提高农作物产量
    阿尔巴尼亚大力兴修水利
    劳动党中央决定扩大灌溉面积和发展林业
    新华社地拉那8日电　在11月2日到3日举行的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会全体会议，一致通过了两项决议——关于扩大灌溉面积和改进灌溉技术的决议；关于发展林业和合理使用木料与节约木料的决议。
    关于扩大灌溉面积和改进灌溉技术的决议指示各级党委、各州执行委员会和农业部门领导广大农民兴修水利、改进灌溉技术，以便迅速地扩大灌溉面积和提高农作物的产量。
    根据计划，在未来的六年中，阿尔巴尼亚将增加九万六千公顷的水浇地。全国的灌溉面积占全国耕地面积的比例将从1938年的27.6％增加到1965年的39.9％。为了完成这一巨大任务中央全会号召全国农民充分利用水源，兴建可灌溉四万一千多公顷土地的地方性的灌溉工程。
    中央全会所通过的关于发展林业和合理使用木料与节约木料的决议指出，各级党委和广大人民，特别是农民群众应加速发展林业经济，除培植、改良和保护森林外，应注意合理采伐木材，节省燃料用材等。
    决议号召农民们多种植具有经济价值的芦苇和试种竹子。
    阿尔巴尼亚在解放后的十五年来共增加了一万三千五百多公顷新耕地，五万五千多公顷的土壤得到了改良，灌溉面积增加了七万三千公顷。1958年全国的水浇地面积比1938年扩大了一倍半。
    阿尔巴尼亚是林木丰富的国家之一，森林复盖的总面积占全国面积的47％，在欧洲仅次于芬兰和瑞典，而居于第三位。按人口平均计算，阿尔巴尼亚每人拥有林木五十三点六立方米。十五年来，阿尔巴尼亚共植林一万七千公顷，有五万七千公顷的森林获得了改良。
