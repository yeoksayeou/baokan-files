Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 3rd.　Albania has achieved new successes in agricultural cooperativization. As of October 1st, the cultivated land area under agricultural cooperatives has reached 81.5% of the country's total cultivated land, and the number of member households has reached 69.6% of the country's total households.

In recent days, the district executive committees and party committees of Tirana, Durrës, Krujë and other regions have written to the Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers, reporting the good news of the development of agricultural cooperativization in their regions. In some regions, the degree of agricultural cooperativization has reached over 90%.

The Tirana region has achieved the most significant results in this year's nationwide cooperativization movement. At the end of last year, the cooperativized land area in this region accounted for only 39% of the total cultivated land area. However, under the direct leadership of the Tirana District Party Committee, and after more than nine months of publicity, comparison, education, and implementation of the principle of voluntary membership, 77.4% of the cultivated land in the region has now been cooperativized. In the plains of this region, the cooperativized land has reached over 98%, and the number of member households accounts for 92.8% of the households in the plains of the region.

Many new agricultural cooperatives have only been established for a year, but have already demonstrated the superiority of collective production. For example, an agricultural cooperative in Durrës achieved an average yield of 15 quintals of wheat per hectare on 50 hectares of land this year, compared to only 10 quintals of wheat per hectare last year.

    阿农业合作化获新成就
    百分之八十以上的耕地实现合作化
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚农业合作化又获得了新的成就。到10月1日为止，农业合作化的耕地面积已占全国耕地总面积的81.5％，入社农户已占全国农户的69.6％。
    连日来，地拉那、都拉斯、克鲁雅等地区的区执行委员会和党委会纷纷写信给党中央和部长会议，报告本地区农业合作化发展的喜讯。有些地区农业合作化的程度已达到了90％以上。
    地拉那区在今年全国合作化运动中获得的成绩最为显著。去年年底，这个区合作化的土地面积仅占全区总耕地面积的39％。但在地拉那区党委会的直接领导下，经过九个多月的宣传、对比、教育和贯彻执行自愿入社的原则，目前，全区已有77.4％的耕地实现了合作化；这个区的平原地带合作化的耕地则达到98％以上，入社的农户占全区平原地带农户的92.8％。
    有不少新的农业社仅仅成立一年，但就已显示出集体生产的优越性。例如，都拉斯的一个农业合作社今年在五十公顷的土地上获得了平均每公顷生产小麦十五公担的成绩，而去年每公顷仅收十公担小麦。
