Strengthening Enterprise Management is an Important Way for Small Factories to Continue Leaping Forward
Rong Zhikui, Ma Kou Coal Mine Youth Red Flag Oil Refinery, Jinbei Special District, Shanxi

Our small coal-to-oil plant at the Ma Kou Coal Mine in Jinbei Special District, Shanxi, was established in June of last year. It is a coal-to-oil plant that uses a combination of indigenous and foreign methods for production. Over the past year, through continuous improvement and sound enterprise management, the oil extraction rate has increased from 50% to 99.67%. The number of furnace runs has increased from three per month to fifteen, reaching 100% of the designed capacity. In terms of tar processing, the time required to process one cauldron has been reduced from 48 hours to 7 hours and 50 minutes. In terms of product variety, five products have been produced, including light diesel, heavy diesel, and crude phenol, and four products such as spindle oil have been trial-produced. The cost of crude oil has been reduced from a maximum of 440.85 yuan per ton to a minimum of 154.11 yuan, and it was rated as a pace-setter in the petroleum system of Jinbei Special District.

Timely adjustment of labor organization and rational allocation of labor force are the main experiences of Ma Kou Coal Mine Oil Refinery in achieving high output, high quality, and low cost. In December of last year, the coal mine needed labor, and the loaders and unloaders of the oil refinery were transferred. With fewer people, how could production not be reduced? At this time, the factory leaders divided all the workers into two groups, each group contracted one furnace, doing their own loading and unloading, and operating independently; at the same time, a labor competition was launched between the two furnaces. As a result, the number of personnel was reduced, but labor productivity was greatly improved. In April of this year, the task was increased, and the contradiction of loading coal not keeping up with refining emerged. At this time, the leaders organized all the people into three operating groups, and the strong and healthy ones were organized into shock teams, led by party member Comrade Bo Mingxian as the captain. As a result of the implementation, although the task was heavy, the production task was still completed excellently without increasing manpower. In short, in terms of labor organization, not only did it meet the production needs from the organizational form, and adjusted the labor organization according to the workers' physical strength and expertise, but also paid attention to the allocation of political strength.

Secondly, constantly summarize experience and promote it in a timely manner. For example, when the highest oil extraction rate reached 99.66%, the factory leaders immediately summarized this high-yield record into ten experiences and promoted it throughout the factory. At the same time, they utilized the experience of continuous production of fourteen furnaces and shortening the processing time, which ensured that from May to August, without rushing or working overtime, an average of twelve to thirteen furnaces were dry distilled and about twenty cauldrons were processed per month (due to insufficient oil storage containers, production was often forced to stop, failing to complete the processing task).

When summarizing the experience, regulations for tar processing and gas analysis were also formulated. These regulations were drafted and written by the workers. Because this was a summary of the workers' own experience, it was convenient and easy to implement.

Third, learn technology, modify tools, and experiment boldly. This factory once organized a technical innovation group. The members of the group are the factory's collective engineers. They often put forward various technical improvement plans. At the same time, they subscribed to publications such as "Petroleum Refining" and "Local Petroleum Industry Communications," bought many relevant business books, and mobilized workers to study on their own, which was of great help in improving technology. Over the past year, this factory has reformed many tools and proposed nearly two hundred rationalization proposals, such as manufacturing their own earthen wax presses and oil-water separation funnels. At the beginning, everyone felt that oil product testing was very mysterious and no one dared to do it. With the strong support of the leaders, after several experiments, the results were good. This played a strong role in guiding production and ensuring product quality.

Fourth, the establishment of various equipment maintenance and repair and tool instrument handover systems greatly extended the service life of machines, furnaces and cauldrons, ensured production, and reduced expenses. For example, the furnace cracked last year, and many people advocated rebuilding it immediately. However, the workers insisted on repairing the furnace every time it was used, and overhauling it every half month, and it was used for another half year. The blower and water pump are managed by designated personnel and inspected every half month, and there have been no accidents in the past year. The tools and instruments used in daily production are handed over every shift, and damage or loss must be recorded in the handover book to find out the cause for handling.

Fifth, team accounting and small ticket material requisition. Under the unified leadership of Ma Kou Coal Mine, team accounting and small ticket material requisition were implemented, that is, at the beginning of each month, each team made a material plan according to the size of the production task, and after approval by the factory leaders, reported it to the finance and supply departments, converted it into prices, and issued small tickets. Each time materials are requisitioned, small tickets of equal prices must be paid. At the end of the month, the cost of the team can be calculated based on the amount of small tickets used and the amount of products, thus developing a habit of careful calculation.

Sixth, establish a system for acceptance of oil products and oil depots, and set up special personnel for management. In the past, only production was paid attention to, and oil product management was neglected. Later, the inventory was checked, the oil products were dehydrated when entering the warehouse, and special personnel were responsible for acceptance, storage, and management. This greatly reduced the waste of oil products. Due to the strengthening of production management, product costs have also decreased significantly.

In 1958, 83.5 tons of crude oil and 600 tons of semi-coke were produced, with a cost of 220.41 yuan per ton of crude oil and 15.5 yuan per ton of semi-coke. In the first half of 1959, 130.68 tons of crude oil were produced, with a cost of 186.86 yuan per ton of oil, and 739.2 tons of semi-coke were produced, with a cost of 12.95 yuan per ton.

At present, the entire factory is striving to complete and overfulfill the annual production of 250 tons of crude oil.

    加强企业管理是小厂继续跃进的重要途径
    山西晋北专区马口煤矿青年红旗炼油厂　荣致魁
    山西晋北专区马口煤矿在去年6月间办起了一座小型煤炼油厂，这是一座用土洋结合方法进行生产的煤炼油厂。一年来经过不断改进和健全企业管理，采油率由50％提高到99.67％。堆炉运转由每月三炉提高到十五炉，达到设计能力的100％。在焦油加工方面，每加工一釜的时间由四十八小时缩短到七小时五十分钟；品种方面，已生产出轻柴油、重柴油、粗酚等五种产品，并试制成锭子油等四种产品。原油成本由最高每吨四百四十元八角五分降低到最低一百五十四元一角一分，被评为晋北专区石油系统的标兵。
    及时调整劳动组织，合理安排劳动力，是马口煤矿炼油厂高产优质低成本的一条主要经验。去年12月份煤矿上需要劳动力，把炼油厂的装卸工调走了。人少了，产量又不能降低，怎么办？这时厂领导上就把全部工人分成两组，各组包干一炉，自己装卸，自己操作；同时，在两炉之间开展了劳动竞赛。结果，人员减少，劳动生产率却大大提高了。今年4月份任务加大了，出现了装煤赶不上炼制的矛盾；这时领导上便把所有的人编成三个操作组，并将身强力壮的编成突击队，由党员薄明显同志担任队长。执行的结果，任务虽大，在不增加人力的情况下，依旧出色地完成了生产任务。总之在劳动组织问题上，不仅从组织形式方面满足了生产需要，按照工人的体力和特长，调整了劳动组织，而且还注意了政治力量的配备。
    其次，不断总结经验，及时加以推广。如最高采油率达到99.66％的时候，厂领导立即将这个高产纪录总结成十条经验，在全厂推广，同时还将连续生产十四炉和缩短加工时间的经验利用起来，保证了5月至8月份在不突击、不加班的情况下，平均每月干馏十二至十三炉，加工二十釜左右（因装油容器不足，经常被迫停产，未能完成加工任务）。
    在总结经验时，还制定了焦油加工和气体分析规程。这些规程是由工人起草编写的，由于这是工人自己经验的总结，因而执行起来，方便易行。
    第三、学技术，改工具，大胆试验。这个厂曾组织了技术革新小组，小组的成员是厂的集体工程师，他们经常提出各种有关技术改进的方案。同时还订有“石油炼制”、“地方石油工业通讯”等刊物，买了许多有关业务书籍，发动工人自学，这对提高技术有很大帮助。一年来这个厂改革了不少工具，提出了将近二百条合理化建议，如自己制造土榨蜡机、油水分离漏斗等。开始，对油品化验大家总觉得很神秘，无人敢搞，在领导的大力支持下，经过几次试验，结果良好。这对指导生产，保证产品质量起到了有力的促进作用。
    第四、建立了各种设备维护检修和工具仪器交接班制度，大大延长了机器、炉子和釜的使用寿命，保证了生产，减少了开支。如堆炉去年就裂了缝，许多人主张立即重建。但工人们坚持了炉炉维修，半月大修，又使用了半年。鼓风机和水泵有专人负责，半月一检修，一年来从未发生过事故。日常生产使用的工具、仪器，班班交接，损坏或丢失都要记在交接簿上，找出原因，以便处理。
    第五、班组核算，小票领料。在马口煤矿统一领导下，实行了班组核算，小票领料，即每月月初各组根据生产任务的大小，作出用料计划，经厂领导批准，报财务、供应部门折成价格，发给小票。每次领料都要付给相等价格的小票，到月底根据用小票多少及产品的多少，就可计算出小组的成本，因而养成了精打细算的习惯。
    第六、建立油品、油库验收制，设专人管理。以往只注意生产，忽视油品管理，以后清点了库存，油品入库时要脱水，由专人验收、保管。这样就大大减少了油品的浪费。由于加强了生产管理，产品成本也有了显著的下降。
    1958年生产原油八十三点五吨，半焦六百吨，每吨原油成本二百二十元四角一分，每吨半焦成本十五元五角。1959年上半年生产原油一百三十点六八吨，每吨油成本一百八十六元八角六分，半焦七百三十九点二吨，每吨成本十二元九角五分。
    目前，全厂正在为完成和超额完成全年生产二百五十吨原油而奋斗。
