    Xinhua News Agency, 26th - Mongolian Ambassador to China, Sharav, held a reception this evening to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Mongolian People's Republic.
	Vice Premier of the State Council, Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC, Chen Shutong, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, Tan Zheng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, Li Siguang, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ji Pengfei, were invited to attend the reception.

	Ambassador Sharav spoke first at the reception. He said that the Mongolian People's Republic has now firmly laid the foundations for a socialist mode of production. 99.3% of farming and herding households nationwide have joined agricultural and pastoral cooperatives. The production volume of industrial products accounts for 40% of the product production volume of all sectors of the national economy. The current daily production volume of the industrial sector is equivalent to the entire year's production volume in 1930. In the socialist construction of the Mongolian People's Republic, the selfless and fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other fraternal countries has played and is playing a huge role.

	Ambassador Sharav said that from the first day of its founding, the Mongolian People's Republic has always pursued a policy of developing friendly relations with the people of all countries on the basis of equality and mutual respect. Now, the Mongolian People's Republic has established diplomatic relations with many countries on all continents that account for more than half of the world's population.

	Ambassador Sharav said that the traditional brotherly friendship between the people of Mongolia and China is developing and consolidating day by day. The people of our two countries have been united by the common goal of building socialism in their own countries and consolidating world peace.

	Ambassador Sharav said that the Mongolian people and all peace-loving people in the world believe that the People's Republic of China must occupy its legitimate seat in the United Nations; and severely condemn the illegal occupation of Taiwan, an inalienable part of Chinese territory, by the American imperialists and the so-called "resolution on the Tibetan issue" passed by the United Nations General Assembly. This resolution is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs. At present, the People's Republic of China is advancing forward with confidence and, after crushing the conspiracies of all kinds of "Cold War" advocates, is increasingly enhancing its international prestige in the face of the whole world.

	Ambassador Sharav proposed a toast to the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people of Mongolia and China.

	Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun spoke at the reception, and on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, he expressed heartfelt congratulations to the government and people of the Mongolian People's Republic.

	Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun said that the Mongolian People's Republic has now become a socialist agricultural-pastoral-industrial country, and Mongolia's cultural and educational undertakings have made great progress, and the people's living standards have been continuously improved and raised. This year, Mongolia has realized agricultural and pastoral cooperation throughout the country and vigorously developed agriculture. State-owned farms have overfulfilled the 1959 grain production plan, and the number of livestock has increased by 1.9% compared to last year. Modern industry has also made great progress. These victories are victories for the Mongolian people and victories for Marxism-Leninism. At present, the Mongolian people are continuing to work hard and struggle to overfulfill the three-year development plan for the national economy and culture. We sincerely wish the Mongolian people new and more brilliant achievements.

	Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun said that the people of China and Mongolia have a brotherly and unbreakable friendship. As early as the years when the Chinese people were resisting Japanese imperialist aggression and waging arduous struggles against domestic and foreign reactionary forces, they received the internationalist sympathy and support of the Mongolian people. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendship between the people of our two countries has continued to develop and strengthen under completely new conditions. Due to the joint efforts of the people of our two countries, in recent years, friendly cooperation between China and Mongolia in various fields such as economy, culture, science and technology has also been significantly strengthened. Such close friendship and unity between the people of our two countries, such continuously developing friendly cooperative and mutual assistance relations, will greatly promote the socialist construction cause of the two countries, and will continue to make new contributions to the prosperity and happiness of the two peoples, to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to safeguarding the cause of peace. Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun finally warmly congratulated the increasingly consolidated eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and Mongolia.

	Also invited to attend the reception were heads of various departments of our government, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life, senior generals of the People's Liberation Army, and diplomatic envoys of various countries to China.

    新华社26日讯　蒙古人民共和国驻中国大使沙拉布今晚举行招待会，庆祝蒙古人民共和国成立三十五周年。
    国务院副总理习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常委会副委员长陈叔通，中共中央书记处书记谭政，政协全国委员会副主席李四光，外交部副部长姬鹏飞等，都应邀出席了招待会。
    沙拉布大使首先在招待会上讲话。他说，蒙古人民共和国现在已牢固地奠定了社会主义生产方式的基础。全国已有99.3％的农户和牧户参加了农牧业合作社。工业产品的生产量占国民经济各部门产品生产量的40％。目前工业部门一天的生产量相当于1930年全年的生产量。在蒙古人民共和国的社会主义建设中，苏联、中华人民共和国和其他兄弟国家无私的、兄弟般的援助曾经起过并正在起着巨大的作用。
    沙拉布大使说，蒙古人民共和国从成立的第一天起，一直奉行着在平等和相互尊重的基础上与各国人民发展友谊关系的政策。现在，蒙古人民共和国已与占全世界人口一半以上的世界各大洲的许多国家建立了外交关系。
    沙拉布大使说，蒙中两国人民的传统的兄弟般的友谊正日复一日地发展着和巩固着。我们两国人民已被在自己国内建设社会主义和巩固世界和平的共同目的团结在一起。
    沙拉布大使说，蒙古人民和全世界爱好和平的人民认为，中华人民共和国必须在联合国中占有自己合法的席位；并严厉地谴责美国帝国主义者对中国领土不可分割的一部分——台湾的非法占领以及联合国大会通过的所谓“关于西藏问题”的决议。这一决议是对中国内政的粗暴干涉。目前，中华人民共和国正满怀信心地向前迈进并于粉碎各色各样的“冷战”拥护者的阴谋后在全世界的面前日益提高了自己的国际威信。
    沙拉布大使提议为蒙中两国人民永恒的牢不可破的友谊干杯。
    习仲勋副总理在招待会上讲话，他代表中国政府和中国人民向蒙古人民共和国政府和蒙古人民表示衷心的祝贺。
    习仲勋副总理说，蒙古人民共和国现在已经成为社会主义的农牧业—工业国家，蒙古的文化教育事业已经有了巨大的发展，人民生活水平也不断得到改善和提高。今年这一年，蒙古在全国实现了农牧业合作化，并且大力发展农业。国营农场已经超额完成了1959年谷物生产计划，牲畜头数比去年增加了1.9％，现代化工业也有了很大的发展。这些胜利，是蒙古人民的胜利，也是马克思列宁主义的胜利。目前，蒙古人民正继续努力，为超额实现国民经济和文化的三年发展计划而斗争，我们衷心地祝愿蒙古人民获得新的、更光辉的成就。
    习仲勋副总理说，中蒙两国人民有着兄弟般的、牢不可破的友谊。中国人民早在抵抗日本帝国主义侵略、同国内外反动势力进行艰苦斗争的年代里，就得到了蒙古人民的国际主义的同情和支援。中华人民共和国成立以来，我们两国人民的友谊更在完全新的条件下不断发展和加强。由于我们两国人民的共同努力，最近几年来，中蒙两国在经济、文化、科学和技术等各个方面的友好合作也在显著地加强。我们两国人民这样亲密的友谊和团结，这样不断发展的友好合作互助关系，必将大大促进两国的社会主义建设事业，必将继续为两国人民的繁荣和幸福、为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和维护和平的事业作出新的贡献。习仲勋副总理最后热烈祝贺中蒙两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊日益巩固。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有我国政府各部门、各人民团体的负责人和各方面的人士，人民解放军高级将领，各国驻华使节等。
