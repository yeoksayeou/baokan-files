Types of Forest Fires

Forest fires, depending on the location of the burning, are generally divided into: surface fires, crown fires, and underground fires.

Surface fire is a fire that burns along the ground. It mainly burns dead and alive plants on the surface, and can sometimes burn young trees, the lower part of tree trunks, and the roots of trees in the surface soil.

If a fire burning along the ground encounters a group of young coniferous trees, or dead wood, or low-hanging branches during the burning process, then the fire on the ground surface will burn upward along these things. When the weather is relatively dry and windy, the fire will spread rapidly along the trunk or crown, forming a crown fire.

A fire that spreads in the humus layer or peat layer is called an underground fire. In an underground fire, the fire burns under the surface of the soil, and only smoke is often seen on the ground, and no flames are visible. This type of fire can destroy tree roots and cause trees to die. Under special circumstances, this fire can also emerge from the ground, causing surface fires or crown fires.

    林火的种类
    森林中的火灾，根据燃烧的部位不同，一般分为：地表火、树冠火、地下火。
    地表火是沿地面烧的火。它主要烧死地表面上死的、活的植物，有时还能烧伤幼树、树干的下部和土壤表层的树根。
    沿着地面烧的火，在燃烧的过程中，若是遇到针叶树的幼树群，或枯死木、低垂的树枝，那么地表面的火就顺着这些东西向上燃烧。在天气比较干燥并且有风的时候，火就沿着树干或树冠迅速扩展，就形成了树冠火。
    在腐植质层或泥炭层里蔓延的火，叫做地下火。地下火，火在地皮下燃烧，地面往往只看见冒烟，看不见火焰。这种火能烧毁树根，使树木枯死。在特殊情况下，这种火也能钻出地面，造成地表火或树冠火。
