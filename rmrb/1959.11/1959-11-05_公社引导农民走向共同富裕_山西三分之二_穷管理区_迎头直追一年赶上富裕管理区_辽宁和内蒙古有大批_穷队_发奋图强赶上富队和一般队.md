    Communes Guide Peasants Towards Common Prosperity
    Two-Thirds of Shanxi's "Poor Management Areas" Catch Up, Surpassing Wealthy Management Areas in One Year
    Large Numbers of "Poor Teams" in Liaoning and Inner Mongolia Strive to Catch Up with Wealthy and Average Teams

    (Reported by this newspaper) People's communes are guiding peasants towards the path of common prosperity. In Shanxi Province, over 63% of the previously "poor management areas" have transformed from poor to wealthy, catching up with the local wealthy and relatively wealthy management areas; the "poor management areas" where the average annual income per person was below 40 yuan have basically disappeared.

    Seventy percent of Shanxi Province is mountainous, historically known for "nine droughts in ten years." Before liberation, the level of agricultural production in rural areas was very low, and the lives of peasants were very difficult. After liberation, through the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the poor conditions in rural areas improved significantly. However, due to differences in natural conditions and labor availability, a considerable number of areas, due to the small size and weak strength of agricultural cooperatives, found it difficult to quickly change their poor conditions. When the people's communes were first established in September last year, among the 20,313 management areas of the 917 people's communes in the province, 7,111 "poor management areas" had an average income of less than 35 yuan per person, accounting for 35% of the total number of management areas in the province. Only one year after the people's commune system was established, the communes made great strides, solving problems that could not be solved during the agricultural cooperative period, and fundamentally changed the poor conditions of the "poor management areas" in one fell swoop. According to preliminary statistics from various regions, of the 7,111 "poor management areas" in the province, 1,500 have caught up with the level of wealthy management areas, with an average income of 75 yuan per person, more than double that of last year; 2,989 "poor management areas" have caught up with the relatively wealthy management areas, with an average income of 50 to 70 yuan per person, an increase of 40% to 100% compared to last year; the average income of the remaining "poor management areas" has also mostly exceeded 40 yuan.

    In the "poor-catch-up-with-rich" movement carried out in various regions, based on the hard work and self-reliance of the "poor management areas," the people's communes demonstrated tremendous superiority in helping the "poor management areas" transform from poor to wealthy. According to a survey conducted by the Rural Work Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China in eleven communes such as Zong'ai in Yuci City and Guoyang in Yuanping County, over the past year, a total of 234,000 yuan was taken from the economic income of the communes to help the "poor management areas" build farmland water conservancy and other basic construction projects, and purchased 45 various machines and more than 200 large livestock. Caojiabao Management Area of Madoutou People's Commune in Zuoyun County used to be a well-known poor area. Although local resources were abundant, it lacked funds and technology, and sideline production could not be developed. This year, the commune provided 5,500 yuan in cash and sent technical cadres to help, resulting in more than 50 sideline production avenues. The total income doubled compared to last year, and the average income per person increased from more than 30 yuan to more than 70 yuan, catching up with the wealthy management areas. The Donghe'nan People's Commune in Lingqiu County is rich in fruits, mountain products, and wild plants. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, mountain products could not be transported out, and there was no processing capacity. Not only could mountain products and wild plants not be utilized, but fruits often resulted in "bumper harvests becoming disasters." Last year, the people's commune established a joint processing plant, which not only used peaches, apricots, and other fruits to make wine, vinegar, sauce, dried fruit, preserves, canned food, and other products, but also used wild grapes, sour vinegar pomegranates, linden bark, and rush to make white wine, man-made fiber, and other new products. The commune members happily said, "Chairman Mao's leadership is really good, rotten apricots leap into treasures; liquor and canned goods are fragrant, exchanged for machines running all over the place."

    While carrying out the "poor-catch-up-with-rich" movement, a surge of "rich-helping-poor" has also been launched in various regions. Due to the small population and extensive cultivation in the "poor management areas" of Tunzhang County in the Taihang Mountains, coupled with the lack of time to manage diversified economies, the average annual income per person was less than 40 yuan. This year, thanks to the support of the commune and the "wealthy management areas," the total value of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery and workshop production in the "poor management areas" increased by 70% compared to last year, and the average income of the commune members increased by 85% compared to last year.

    In the "poor-catch-up-with-rich" movement, various regions have generally conducted thorough investigations, ranked teams, studied the root causes of poverty in different types of "poor management areas," and established various model teams for improving alkaline land, developing diversified economies, and carrying out basic construction to transform from poor to wealthy. At the same time, they identified catch-up targets and launched competitions.

    This year, Shanxi Province issued more than 20 million yuan in production investment loans to support "poor management areas." Various regions have sent a large number of cadres with rich experience in rural work to reside in "poor management areas" for a long time to help with work. The fact that the provincial party committee and the grass-roots party committees are paying as much attention to grasping backwardness as they did to grasping advancement in the past has played a huge role in the rapid change of the "poor management areas."

    (Reported by this newspaper) Over the past year, a good situation of poor teams catching up with wealthy teams has emerged in rural areas of Liaoning Province, fully demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes.

    According to surveys and statistics from various regions, a total of 1,702 poor teams in the province have changed their original appearances. Among them, more than 1,050 teams have caught up with the income level of the average teams in the local area, and 650 teams have caught up with the income level of the wealthy teams in the local area. In addition, 1,669 average teams in the province have caught up with the income level of the wealthy teams in the local area. This has reduced the proportion of poor teams in the total number of production teams in the province from more than 30% to 11.2%, while the number of wealthy teams has increased from less than a quarter last year to almost half.

    Due to the different original economic foundations and natural conditions of each production team, there are still differences between poor teams and wealthy teams. In order to eliminate this difference, the communes have generally strengthened the leadership of the poor teams, equipped the poor teams with strong leadership backbones, launched communist cooperation among the teams; more importantly, educated the commune members of the poor teams to work hard, be self-reliant, and thus quickly changed the face of poverty.

    (Reported by this newspaper) A group of poor teams in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia are working hard and striving to improve, gradually changing their original appearance and catching up with the income level of the average teams.

    At the end of last year, more than 70,000 households of various ethnic groups in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia formed 158 communes, with a total of 886 production teams. Among them, average teams accounted for 57%, wealthy teams accounted for 26%, and 150 teams had relatively difficult economic conditions and were classified as poor teams (the distinguishing marks were: wealthy teams had an average annual income of about 90 yuan per person, average teams had about 75 yuan, and poor teams had about 55 yuan). Party and government leading departments at all levels in the autonomous region are extremely concerned about changing the appearance of poor teams, and have taken measures in various aspects to encourage and help poor teams to learn from advanced teams. After recent efforts over the past eight or nine months, 72 poor teams in pastoral areas have caught up with the income level of the average teams. The proportion of poor teams in the communes in pastoral areas throughout the region has rapidly decreased from the original 17% to 8.8%.

    In the process of changing the appearance of poor teams in pastoral areas, in addition to using state-allocated aid funds to help poor teams increase livestock and means of production, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has focused on carrying out a lot of work in four aspects: strengthening production leadership, developing diversified management, launching the movement to increase production and practice economy, and promoting cooperation and support.

    公社引导农民走向共同富裕
    山西三分之二“穷管理区”迎头直追一年赶上富裕管理区
    辽宁和内蒙古有大批“穷队”发奋图强赶上富队和一般队
    本报讯　人民公社引导农民走向共同富裕的道路。山西省63％强的“穷管理区”由穷变富，赶上了当地富裕管理区和比较富裕的管理区；原来全省每人平均全年收入在四十元以下的“穷管理区”已经基本上绝迹。
    山西省70％的地区是山区，一向以“十年九旱”著称。解放前农村生产水平很低，农民生活很苦。解放以后经过互助合作运动，农村穷困面貌有了很大改观。但是由于自然条件、劳力情况的不同，有相当一部分地区因为农业社范围小、力量单薄，难以迅速改变穷困面貌。去年9月人民公社刚成立的时候，全省九百一十七个人民公社的二万零三百一十三个管理区中，每人平均收入在三十五元以下的“穷管理区”有七千一百一十一个，占全省管理区总数的35％。人民公社化以后，为时仅仅一年，公社大展宏图，解决了农业社时期所不能解决的问题，一举而从根本上改变了“穷管理区”的穷困面貌。据各地初步统计，现在，全省七千一百一十一个“穷管理区”中，已有一千五百个“穷管理区”赶上了富管理区的水平，每人平均收入达到七十五元，比去年提高了一倍多；有二千九百八十九个“穷管理区”赶上了比较富裕的管理区，每人平均收入五十元到七十元，比去年提高40％到一倍；其余的“穷管理区”每人平均收入也大都超过了四十元。
    各地开展穷赶富运动中，在“穷管理区”发奋图强，自力更生的基础上，人民公社在帮助“穷管理区”由穷变富过程中显示了巨大的优越性。据中共山西省委农村工作部在榆次市宗艾、原平县崞阳等十一个公社的调查，一年来共从公社经济收入中拿出二十三万四千多元，帮助“穷管理区”兴修了农田水利等基本建设，并购置了各种机械四十五部、大牲口二百多头。左云县马道头人民公社曹家堡管理区，过去是当地有名的穷地方。当地资源虽然丰富，就是缺乏资金和技术，副业生产搞不起来。今年，公社支援了五千五百元现金，又派去技术干部帮助，结果找出五十多种副业门路，总收入比去年扩大了一倍，每人平均收入由三十多元上升到七十多元，赶上了富管理区。灵丘县东河南人民公社，这里盛产水果、山货和野生植物，过去因为交通不便，山货运不出去，又无加工能力，不仅山货、野生植物不能利用，就是水果也往往形成“丰收成灾”。去年人民公社办起了联合加工厂，不仅用桃、杏等水果制成了酒、醋、酱、果干、果脯、罐头等产品，而且还利用山葡萄、酸醋榴、椴树皮、龙须草等制成了白酒、人造纤维等新产品。社员们高兴地说：“毛主席领导真是好，烂杏一跃变珍宝；露酒、罐头喷鼻香，换回机器遍地跑。”
    各地在开展穷赶富运动的同时，又掀起了富帮穷热潮。太行山区屯长县的“穷管理区”，由于地多人少耕作粗放，加以无暇经营多种经济，平均每人每年收入不到四十元。今年由于公社和“富管理区”的支援，“穷管理区”林牧副渔业和作坊生产总值比去年提高了70％，社员的平均收入比去年提高了85％。
    各地在开展穷赶富运动中，普遍摸底、排队，研究了不同类型“穷管理区”所以穷的根源，并就地树立了改良碱地、发展多种经济、进行基本建设由穷变富的各色各样的标兵，同时物色了追赶对象，展开竞赛。
    今年，山西省发放了扶植“穷管理区”的生产投资贷款达二千多万元，各地都派了大批富有农村工作经验的干部，长期驻“穷管理区”帮助工作。由于从省委到基层党委像过去抓先进一样地抓落后，这对“穷管理区”迅速改变面貌起了巨大的作用。
    本报讯　一年来，辽宁省农村出现了穷队赶上富队的良好形势，充分显示出人民公社的无比优越性。
    根据各地的调查统计，全省已有一千七百零二个穷队改变了原来的面貌。其中有一千零五十多个队赶上当地一般队的收入水平，有六百五十个队赶上当地富队的收入水平。此外，全省还有一千六百六十九个一般队，赶上了当地富队的收入水平。这就使穷队在全省生产队总数中所占的比例，由30％强下降为11.2％，而富队却由去年的不足四分之一上升到几占一半。
    由于各个生产队原有的经济基础和自然条件不同，还存在着穷队与富队的差别。为了消灭这种差别，各公社一般都加强了对穷队的领导，给穷队配备了强有力的领导骨干，发动各队之间开展共产主义大协作；更重要的，是教育穷队的社员，发奋图强，自立更生，因而迅速改变了贫困面貌。
    本报讯　内蒙古牧区一批穷队发奋图强，力争上游，逐步改变原来面貌，赶上了一般队的收入水平。
    去年年底，内蒙古牧区七万多户各民族人民组成了一百五十八个公社，共八百八十六个生产队。其中一般队占57％，富队占26％，还有一百五十个队经济状况比较困难，被列为穷队（区别的标志是：富队每人每年平均收入九十元左右，一般队七十五元左右，穷队五十五元左右）。自治区各级党政领导部门对改变穷队面貌异常关心，从各方面采取措施，鼓励和帮助穷队向先进队看齐。经过最近八、九个月的努力，已有七十二个牧区穷队赶上了一般队的收入水平。全区牧区公社中的穷队比重已由原来的17％迅速下降到8.8％。
    在改变牧区穷队面貌的过程中，内蒙古自治区除运用国家拨给的扶助款帮助穷队增加牲畜和生产工具外，着重从加强生产领导、发展多种经营、展开增产节约运动和提倡协作支援等四个方面进行了不少工作。
