    A Model for Urban Non-Staple Food Production
    On Chongqing's Experience of Basic Self-Sufficiency in Non-Staple Foods
    Today, this newspaper publishes the news and articles about Chongqing achieving basic self-sufficiency in non-staple foods at the current supply level. Chongqing's achievement is a victory for the mass movement on the non-staple food production front and is also a significant experience. In June of this year, the Party Central Committee convened a conference on non-staple food and handicraft production in large and medium-sized cities, requiring cities to implement the principle of "self-reliance as the mainstay, supplemented by external assistance" in non-staple food production. At that time, some people, especially those with right-leaning thoughts, doubted whether this principle could be quickly realized. Now, Chongqing and many other cities have begun to realize this principle by boosting their energy and fully mobilizing the masses. Facts have proven that this principle can be fully realized through effort.
    Chongqing, like many other cities in China, is undergoing large-scale construction, and its industry is developing rapidly. The urban population has increased from about 1.3 million in 1953 to over 2.2 million. The increase in the urban population and the gradual improvement of people's living standards have correspondingly increased the demand for non-staple foods. According to the current supply level, residents in the Chongqing urban area need more than a billion catties of vegetables, hundreds of thousands of pigs, and millions of poultry annually. Thanks to many effective measures, the supply of these non-staple foods is now basically guaranteed, reversing the historical dependence on large-scale imports from other regions.
    Chongqing is not the only city to have achieved remarkable success on the non-staple food front. For example, Shanghai, China's largest city, has reached a self-sufficiency rate of over 40% in non-staple foods. Another example is Anshan, a steel base, where vegetable production this year has increased several times over last year. The number of pigs in the city by mid-August had increased by 50% compared to the beginning of the year, and the number of chickens raised in the city by mid-August had more than tripled compared to the beginning of the year. The production of non-staple foods such as beef cattle, vegetable sheep, fish, and rabbits has also seen great development. Whether in the South or the North, whether in mountainous or plain areas, whether in large, medium, or small cities, or in industrial and mining areas, similar examples are increasing. These valuable experiences fully demonstrate that as long as leadership is strengthened, energy is boosted, and basic self-sufficiency in urban non-staple foods is entirely possible, and difficulties in work can be overcome. Therefore, the basic question is whether or not there is energy. If there is no energy, as the editorial in this newspaper on the 11th stated: "Dragging one's feet, being frightened by difficulties, thinking that this is impossible and that cannot be done, this is the worldview of cowards and lazy people. Without changing this worldview, nothing can be accomplished."
    The experiences of Chongqing, Shanghai, Anshan, and many other cities prove that to develop non-staple food production, the Party committee must strengthen leadership, implement the spirit of opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting energy, and launch a large-scale mass movement. According to the experiences of these cities, there are four important issues to pay attention to in launching a large-scale mass movement on the non-staple food front. First, all forces must be mobilized, including the forces of state-owned non-staple food production bases, the people's communes, production teams, and the families of commune members, as well as the forces of government agencies, enterprises, schools, troops, and urban residents. Establishing and developing state-owned non-staple food production bases is of great significance for meeting the needs of urban non-staple foods. State-owned non-staple food production bases, including farms run by agricultural reclamation departments and farms run by commercial departments, are economies owned by the whole people, which have greater advantages than the collective production of communes. They have a high commodity rate, convenient material mobilization, and can provide a wealth of experience in developing non-staple food production; they also facilitate the breeding of superior varieties and the training of technical cadres. Therefore, it is necessary to actively develop and gradually expand the non-staple food production of state-owned farms. People's communes are the main force in non-staple food production. Within the commune, we should also implement the principle of developing collectively operated non-staple food production as the mainstay, and vigorously develop large-scale non-staple food production bases operated by the commune; at the same time, we should also pay attention to developing small and medium-sized production bases operated by production teams or production brigades, because such bases can easily obtain materials locally and simplify equipment, feed, fertilizer, and tools. Small and medium-sized pig raising bases are also easy to combine with the accumulation and application of fertilizer in the surrounding farmland. While developing collective non-staple food production, we should also encourage commune members to carry out certain decentralized production according to different varieties and different situations. This is conducive to fully utilizing the scattered land around the houses of commune members, utilizing the scattered pigsties and chicken coops of farmers, and facilitating the utilization of the scattered labor time and auxiliary labor force of families. Government agencies, enterprises, schools, troops, and residents in the city are also forces that cannot be ignored on the non-staple food production front. In Chongqing, the number of pigs raised by government agencies, enterprises, schools, troops, and residents accounts for 6% of the city's total, the number of poultry raised accounts for 14%, and the number of acres planted with vegetables accounts for 6%. More than 350 units in the city have already achieved self-sufficiency in pork, which is a good illustration.
    Second, in developing non-staple food production, we must strengthen cooperation between various departments and units. The experience of many cities has proven that if socialist cooperation is done well, the production, processing, transportation, purchase and sale, and consumption of non-staple foods can be seamlessly connected and closely coordinated; various non-staple food productions can be mutually connected with other productions; various departments and units can exchange what they have for what they need, and many idle or discarded materials can be transformed from useless to useful, and manpower can also be mutually supported; at the same time, it is easy to exchange experiences, learn techniques, and let the advanced drive the backward, and "skilled hands" teach "green hands," so that production can be continuously raised to a new level.
    Third, the experiences of Chongqing and many other cities have also proven that to rapidly develop non-staple food production, a series of measures need to be taken organizationally and technically, not only to solve the vegetable problem, but also to solve the pig raising problem, which seems to be more difficult. Regarding vegetables, after appropriately expanding the vegetable planting area, it is also necessary to carry out basic construction of vegetable fields, improve cultivation techniques, increase superior varieties, and organize large-scale processing and storage after harvest, and so on. Without this series of work, the vegetable area will be expanded, but the harvest may not reach the expected amount; if there is no large-scale processing and storage after a good harvest, it will be difficult to ensure supply during the off-season of vegetable production. To solve the supply of meat, we mainly rely on pig raising. The problems that need to be solved and the measures that need to be taken in pig raising are much more complicated than growing vegetables, and the experience provided by Chongqing in this regard is even more worthy of attention. They first implemented the method of self-breeding and self-raising to solve the problem of pig sources; they adopted methods such as selecting good pig farms, raising pigs in groups according to age, building pigsties with local materials, accelerating fattening, and improving tools to solve the management problems of large-scale raising; they adopted methods such as establishing epidemic prevention organizations, training epidemic prevention personnel, and conducting epidemic prevention injections to solve the prevention and control of pig diseases; especially on the key issue of feed, they put forward the slogan of "raising pigs with poor methods" and took many measures, such as fully utilizing the leaves, vines, stalks, and shells of agricultural products to process into green feed, utilizing ponds, dikes, and rivers to develop large quantities of high-yield feeds such as water hyacinth, utilizing the by-products of sugar mills, wineries, oil mills, flour mills, and tofu mills to supplement refined feed, collecting wild feed, establishing feed fields, utilizing open spaces to plant high-yield feed, and promoting the method of combining grazing and stall feeding. The process of Chongqing's development of pig raising shows that: there are difficulties, but as long as the masses are fully mobilized and detailed work is carried out, many difficulties can be overcome.
    Here, some people may worry: Will large-scale planting of vegetables and green feed in urban suburbs affect grain production? The facts in Chongqing show that non-staple food production and grain production have both mutually influencing and mutually promoting aspects. For example, the development of the pig raising industry has greatly promoted the increase in grain production. This year, the number of pigs in the Tushan People's Commune in the suburbs of Chongqing has doubled compared to last year, with an average of 1.4 pigs per mu of land, and the average fertilizer increase per mu of cultivated land is 6,000 catties. The commune's total grain output is expected to increase by more than 20% compared to last year. In addition, Chongqing has also promoted the experience of suburban farmers in the past of intercropping and interplanting grain in vegetable fields, so that these vegetable fields can also produce some grain. It can be seen that the contradiction between non-staple food production and grain production can be appropriately resolved, and the idea that the development of non-staple food production in the near suburbs must rely on the state to supply a large amount of grain is incorrect. Of course, some cities have smaller suburbs, and agricultural production is not very developed near some newly emerging industrial and mining bases, and the simultaneous development of grain and non-staple food production will encounter some difficulties. In this case, the near suburbs should still focus on the development of non-staple food production. If the grain problem cannot be solved even after the greatest effort, the state can provide supplies as appropriate.
    Fourth, on the basis of developing non-staple food production, we must also do a good job in distribution, strive to improve the commodity rate, and properly arrange planned consumption in order to reasonably guarantee the needs of all parties. This is also an experience in the development of non-staple food production in Chongqing and many other cities. Non-staple food production must ensure a reasonable commodity rate, that is, the non-staple food produced must have an appropriate ratio between the commodity part and the self-sufficient part, in order to take into account the needs of urban residents and suburban rural areas, and the needs of urban areas should be guaranteed first. To do this, we must strengthen political and ideological work, conduct propaganda and education on the worker-peasant alliance to the commune cadres and farmers in the suburbs, explain the reason why suburban agricultural production serves the city, and explain the benefits of selling non-staple foods to national construction, to the commune, and to the farmers themselves; cadres should also emphasize the establishment of an overall concept and overcome departmentalism. At the same time, there should also be appropriate arrangements for the non-staple foods retained for use in the suburban rural areas, which is also very important for encouraging the production enthusiasm of farmers. In order to achieve reasonable distribution and ensure a reasonable proportion of commodity volume, corresponding purchase systems should be established, such as the contract sales method for vegetables and the assigned purchase method for live pigs. Whether it is the commodity part or the self-sufficient part, consumption must be planned. The production of non-staple foods has a certain seasonality, while consumption needs are constant, and the current demand for non-staple foods often exceeds the amount of production, so it must be planned. We must take care of the present and look forward to the future. We cannot raise the level of consumption too hastily or too high just because non-staple food production has increased somewhat and seems to be more in one time and one place.
    Like the good situation on all fronts across the country, the non-staple food front is also a scene of prosperity. From the warm South to the cold North, from the fertile plains to the remote mountainous areas, everyone is actively developing the production of vegetables, meat, and other non-staple foods, and has already achieved great results. However, compared with our goals, these achievements are only preliminary. Although Chongqing has achieved basic self-sufficiency in non-staple foods according to current standards, it has not yet achieved complete self-sufficiency, and it must also be taken into account that as people's living standards improve, the supply of non-staple foods must also increase accordingly, so it is necessary to continue to move forward on the existing basis, not only in terms of vegetables and meat, but also to strive to increase production in edible vegetable oil, aquatic products, fruits, etc., in order to better meet the growing needs of the people. Many other cities should also continue to work hard, continue to develop non-staple food production like Chongqing, and strive to do better. The vast rural areas should also continue to develop non-staple food production according to the principle of "both urban and rural areas," support cities, and support national construction, and there should not be the slightest relaxation because of the current development of urban non-staple food production. We believe that under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, as long as we continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost energy, and continue to launch a large-scale mass movement, the production of non-staple foods in urban and rural areas across the country will surely develop rapidly and achieve greater success.

    城市副食品生产的榜样
    论重庆市副食品基本自给的经验
    今天本报发表了重庆市副食品按照当地现在供应的水平达到基本自给的消息和文章。重庆市的成就，是副食品生产战线上大搞群众运动的胜利，也是一个有重大意义的经验。今年6月，党中央召开的大中城市副食品、手工业生产会议要求在城市实行“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的副食品生产的方针。当时，曾经有一些人，特别是有右倾思想的人，曾经怀疑这个方针能不能很快实现。现在，重庆和其他许多城市由于鼓足了干劲，充分发动了群众，这个方针已经开始实现了。事实证明，这个方针是经过努力完全可以实现的。
    重庆市正像我国其他许多城市一样，正在进行大规模的建设，工业正在迅速发展，市区人口从1953年的一百三十万左右增加到二百二十万以上。城市人口的增加和人民生活水平的逐步提高，对副食品的需要量也相应地增加了。按照目前的供应水平，重庆市区居民每年需要十几亿斤蔬菜，几十万头猪和几百万只家禽；由于采取了许多有效的措施，现在基本上保证了这些副食品的供应，扭转了历史上依赖外地大量调入的状况。
    在副食品战线上获得显著成就的城市，并不只重庆一个。例如，我国最大的城市上海，副食品的自给率已达到40％以上。又如钢铁基地的鞍山市，今年蔬菜生产比去年成倍地增加，全市生猪头数到8月中旬已比年初增加了50％，全市养鸡头数，8月中旬比年初增加了两倍还多；养菜牛、养菜羊、养鱼、养兔等副食品生产，也都有很大的发展。无论南方、北方，无论山区、平原，无论大城市、中等城市、小城市还是工矿区，类似的例子，日益增多。这些宝贵的经验充分证明，只要加强领导，鼓足干劲，做到城市副食品基本自给是完全可能的，工作中的困难是可以克服的。因此，基本问题在于是不是有干劲。如果没有干劲，正如11日本报社论所说：“拖拖沓沓，被困难吓倒，这也不可能，那也办不到，这是懦夫和懒汉的世界观，不改变这种世界观，什么事情也是办不成的。”
    重庆、上海、鞍山和其他许多城市的经验证明，发展副食品生产必须党委加强领导，贯彻反右倾鼓干劲的精神，大搞群众运动。根据这些城市的经验，在副食品战线上大搞群众运动，有四个重要问题需要注意。第一，要调动一切力量，这包括国营副食品生产基地的力量，人民公社、生产队和社员家庭的力量，也包括机关、企业、学校、部队和城市居民的力量。建立和发展国营副食品生产基地，对于满足城市副食品的需要有着重要意义。国营副食品生产基地，包括农垦部门经营的农牧场和商业部门经营的农牧场，是全民所有制的经济，它比之公社的集体生产具有更大的优越性。它的商品率高，物资调动方便，而且可以提供大量发展副食品生产的经验；也便于繁殖优良品种，培养技术干部。因此，必须积极发展和逐步扩大国营农牧场的副食品生产。人民公社是副食品生产的主力。在公社里面，又应当贯彻执行发展集体经营的副食品生产为主的方针，大力发展公社经营的、大型的副食品生产基地；同时也注意发展生产队或生产大队经营的中小型的生产基地，因为这样的基地在设备、饲料、肥料、工具方面便于就地取材、因陋就简，中小型的养猪基地还便于和周围农田的积肥、施肥工作结合起来。在发展集体副食品生产的同时，根据不同品种和不同情况，也应当鼓励社员进行一定的分散生产，这样做有利于充分利用社员宅前屋后等零星的土地，利用农民分散的猪圈鸡棚，便于利用社员的零星劳动时间和家庭辅助劳动力。城市的机关、企业、学校、部队以及居民也是副食品生产战线上不可忽视的力量。重庆市机关、企业、学校、部队、居民养猪数量占全市总数的6％，饲养家禽数量占14％，种菜亩数占6％，全市已经有三百五十多个单位做到猪肉自给，这些事实就是一个很好的说明。
    第二，在发展副食品生产当中，必须加强各部门、各单位之间的协作。许多城市的经验证明，社会主义的协作搞得好，副食品的生产、加工、运输、购销、消费之间，各种副食品生产同其他生产之间，就能够互相衔接，密切配合；各部门、各单位之间就能够互通有无，许多闲置的或者废弃的物资就能够变无用为有用，人力也可以互相支援；同时便于交流经验，学习技术，先进带动后进，“熟手”教会“生手”，从而使生产不断提高到新的水平。
    第三，重庆市和其他许多城市的经验还证明，要迅速地发展副食品生产，还需要从组织上、技术上采取一系列的措施，不仅要解决蔬菜问题，而且还要解决看来似乎困难较多的养猪问题。关于蔬菜，在适当扩大蔬菜种植面积以后，还要进行菜田的基本建设，改进栽培技术，增加优良品种，在丰收之后还要组织大量加工储存，等等。没有这一系列的工作，蔬菜面积扩大了，收获量未必达到预期的数量；丰收了，如果不大量加工储存，在蔬菜生产淡季也难以确保供应。解决肉食的供应，主要靠养猪。在养猪方面需要解决的问题和需要采取的措施，比种菜要复杂得多，重庆市在这方面提供的经验也就更加值得重视。他们首先实行自繁自养的办法，解决了猪源问题；采取选好猪场、按月龄分群饲养、就地取材修建猪圈、加速催肥、改良工具等办法，解决了大群饲养的管理问题；采取建立防疫组织、培训防疫人员、进行防疫注射等办法，解决了生猪疫病的防治问题；特别是在饲料这个关键性的问题上，提出了“用穷办法养猪”的口号，采取了许多办法，例如充分利用农产品的叶、藤、秆、壳等加工为青饲料，利用塘堰、溪河大量发展水浮莲等高产饲料，利用糖坊、酒坊、油坊、粉坊、豆腐坊的副产品补充精饲料，采集野生饲料，建立饲料地和利用空地栽种高产饲料，推行放牧与圈养相结合的办法等等。重庆市发展养猪业的过程说明：困难是有的，但是只要充分发动群众，进行细致的工作，许多困难都是可以克服的。
    这里也许有人担心：在城市郊区大量种蔬菜、种青饲料，会不会影响粮食生产？重庆市的事实说明，副食品生产和粮食生产有相互影响的一面，同时也有相互促进的一面。例如养猪事业的发展就大大促进了粮食的增产。重庆市郊区涂山人民公社今年生猪比去年增加了一倍，每亩地合到一点四头，每亩耕地平均增加肥料六千斤，全社粮食预计将比去年增产20％以上。另外，重庆市还推广了郊区农民过去利用菜地间种、套种粮食等经验，使这些菜地也能生产一部分粮食。由此可见，副食品生产和粮食生产的矛盾是可以适当解决的，认为近郊区发展副食品生产就必须依赖国家供应大量粮食的想法是不正确的。当然，有些城市郊区较小，有些新兴的工矿基地附近农业生产不甚发达，粮食和副食品生产同时发展会遇到一些困难。在这种情况下，近郊区仍应以发展副食品生产为主。如果经过最大努力还不能解决粮食问题，国家是可以酌情给予供应的。
    第四，在发展副食品生产的基础上，还必须做好分配工作，努力提高商品率和妥善安排计划消费，才能合理地保证各方面的需要。这也是重庆和其他许多城市发展副食品生产的一条经验。副食品生产必须保证合理的商品率，也就是说，生产出来的副食品，商品部分和自给部分要有适当的比例，以兼顾市区居民和郊区农村的需要，而且首先应当保证市区的需要。要做到这一点，就必须加强政治思想工作，向郊区的公社干部和农民进行工农联盟的宣传教育，讲清楚郊区农业生产为城市服务的道理，讲清楚出售副食品对国家建设、对公社和农民本身的好处；在干部中还应当强调树立整体观念，克服本位思想。同时，对郊区农村留用的副食品，也应当有适当的安排，这对鼓励农民生产积极性也是很重要的。为了作到合理分配，保证商品量的合理比例，应当建立相应的收购制度，如对蔬菜的包销办法、对生猪的派购办法等。无论商品的部分或者自给的部分，都必须有计划地安排消费。副食品的生产都带有一定的季节性，而消费需要却是经常的，同时目前对副食品的需要量又往往超过生产的数量，因此必须有计划地加以安排。既要照顾目前，又要展望将来。不能因为副食品生产有了一些增长，在一时一地来看显得多了一些，就过急过高地提高消费水平。
    和全国各个战线的良好形势一样，副食品战线上目前也是一片欣欣向荣的景象。从温暖的南方到严寒的北方，从丰饶的平原到边远的山区，都在积极发展蔬菜、肉食和其他副食品生产，并且已经取得了很大成绩。但是，同我们的目标相比较，这些成就还是初步的。重庆市虽然按照现行标准已经实现副食品基本自给，但还没有做到完全自给，而且还要考虑到随着人民生活水平的提高，副食品的供应量也要随着增长，因此还需要在现有的基础上继续前进，不仅在菜蔬和肉类方面，而且要在食用植物油、水产、水果等方面努力增产，以更好地满足人们日益增长的需要。其他许多城市也应当继续努力，像重庆一样不断发展副食品生产，并且争取做得更好。广大农村也要根据“城乡并举”的方针，继续发展副食品生产，支援城市，支援国家建设，不能因为目前城市副食品生产的发展而有一丝一毫的放松。我们相信，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，只要继续反右倾、鼓干劲，继续大搞群众运动，全国城乡副食品生产一定能够迅速发展，取得更大的成就。
