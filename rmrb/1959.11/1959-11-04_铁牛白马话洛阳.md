    Iron Ox and White Horse Speak of Luoyang
    Xiang Dong
    These days, the people of Luoyang, both urban and rural, are all talking about the great news of the tractor factory starting production, praising the "Dongfanghong" (East is Red) tractor like a diligent and beautiful girl. From the day the tractor factory broke ground, it became the pride of the Luoyang people, a topic they frequently cared about and discussed. Now that it has officially mounted the steed of the motherland's socialist economic construction, how could its hometown not be doubly joyful and encouraged? The ancient city of Luoyang has added so much spring color!
    Speaking of Luoyang, people will think of its long history. Two thousand years ago, it became the capital of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. In the following thousand years, it successively became the capital of nine dynasties, making it the ancient city with the longest period as a capital in Chinese history.
    Its scenery is beautiful. In its heyday, it enjoyed the reputation of "Luoyang being the most important of all famous gardens in the world." Such as the Golden Valley Garden of Shi Chong in the Western Jin Dynasty, the Pingquan Villa of Li Deyu in the Tang Dynasty, the Anle Nest of Shao Kangjie in the Northern Song Dynasty, and the Dule Garden of Sima Guang, all were extremely prosperous for a time. The peonies of Luoyang are even more extraordinarily good, with the long-standing reputation of "Luoyang peonies being the best in the world." Tang and Song poets and writers simply regarded them as an important creative theme. Ouyang Xiu and Hu Yuanzhi wrote peony chronicles, Shu Yuanxu and Xu Wei wrote peony rhapsodies, and Zhang Yue and Yang Cheng'an and others wrote peony songs. Luoyang people love flowers as a custom. The Records of Famous Gardens in Luoyang says: "When the flowers are in bloom..., the ladies and gentlemen in the city abandon cooking and go to enjoy the flowers..." From Bai Juyi's poem "The spring in the imperial city is coming to an end, the carriages and horses bustle about, all say it is the time for peonies, they go together to buy flowers..." one can imagine the scene at that time. Su Dongpo's "A single enchanting red flower is intoxicating, the spring light reflects back, shaming the snow and frost, the artistry of nature only wants to present new ingenuity, not letting idle people get a little rest," actually wrote the Luoyang peony so charming!
    Speaking of Luoyang, who can not think of one of China's three major treasure troves of stone carving art – Longmen Grottoes? The mountain cliffs and caves are filled with carved Buddha statues, the large ones over ten feet tall, the small ones less than an inch, lifelike, and with thousands of different appearances. Speaking of Luoyang, who can not think of the birthplace of Buddhism in China – White Horse Temple? It was the first temple built more than 1,800 years ago (11th year of Yongping in the Eastern Han Dynasty) after using a white horse to bring scriptures back from India. During the Wei and Tang dynasties, there were as many as a thousand monks in the temple. Every morning and evening, the sound of chanting sutras and striking bells was melodious and far-reaching. It has been protected by the people for a long time, and has stood majestically for thousands of years to this day. Speaking of Luoyang, one cannot help but think of the names of many poets and writers. Many of Li Bai's poems mention Luoyang. "Whose jade flute is secretly playing, scattering into the spring breeze, filling the city of Luoyang..." evoked his homesickness. Du Fu studied in Luoyang from a young age. When he was wandering in Zizhou in his later years, when he heard that the government army had recovered Henan and Hebei, he wrote the soul-stirring famous poem: "Suddenly hearing of the recovery of Jibei beyond the sword gate, tears wet my clothes at the first news..., I will immediately travel from Ba Gorge through Wu Gorge, and then go down to Xiangyang towards Luoyang." What deep feelings he had for his hometown of Luoyang. Later, this poem touched the hearts of countless exiles in troubled times. Bai Juyi lived on Xiangshan Mountain in Longmen, Luoyang for eighteen years. He wrote many poems here, and when he died, he instructed his family to bury him on Xiangshan Mountain. Fu Yi's "Rhapsody on the Capital of Luoyang," Zhang Heng's "Rhapsody on the Eastern Capital," and Zuo Taichong's "Rhapsody on the Three Capitals" all made brilliant descriptions of Luoyang. People in the Jin Dynasty competed to copy Zuo Si's "Rhapsody on the Three Capitals," and for a time the "paper of Luoyang became expensive." However, although they were all incredibly talented, they were still inevitably inferior to today's heroes. In the era of the Great Leap Forward, more than thousands of singers and poems emerged from the working people of Luoyang! These poems did not make the price of paper in Luoyang rise, but they reflected the socialist era and described the face of socialist Luoyang.
    Luoyang was the political, economic, and cultural center of ancient China, and once radiated dazzling brilliance. However, it gradually declined after the Tang Dynasty, and the destruction during the Jin and Yuan dynasties was particularly tragic. The few remaining buildings were further ravaged by warlords, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and imperialism. Wu Peifu, a reactionary warlord who relied on Anglo-American forces, long entrenched himself in Luoyang, building barracks in Xigong, recruiting soldiers and buying horses, causing harm to the country and the people. The secret order to manufacture the "February 7th" massacre in 1923, in which striking workers of the Beijing-Hankou Railway were slaughtered, was issued from here. In 1932, after the "January 28th" incident, the Kuomintang reactionary government, under the intimidation of Japanese imperialism, hastily moved its capital to Luoyang, wasting money and manpower, and greatly tarnished this ancient city. During the Anti-Japanese War, under Chiang Kai-shek's policy of passively resisting Japan and actively opposing communism, Japanese planes with "red plaster patches" almost daily poured tons and tons of bombs and incendiary bombs on this ancient city, and soon the iron hooves of the Japanese invaders were imprinted on it.
    During the Kuomintang rule in Luoyang, the people's livelihood was declining. The entire industry was just a 500-kilowatt power plant and a poorly equipped Longmen coal mine. The people suffered humiliation and oppression, living a miserable life. On the roads and in dilapidated temples, refugees fleeing from the Yellow River flood area lay everywhere, crying from hunger and cold, selling their children, and countless people starved to death, froze to death, or were crushed to death under the wheels while trying to escape by train. The story of "Luoyang River Weeping at Night" circulated among the masses: the affectionate Luoyang River cried sadly at night, shedding the tears of the working people! It cried so sadly that it woke up the majestic Mangshan Mountain, which shouted loudly: What's the use of crying, it's better to roar bravely and wash away the suffering of the people! So, the Luo River changed its character and became strong and brave. At that time, the White Horse Temple was full of puppet troops and became a forbidden area. The stone Buddhas of Longmen were massively stolen and chiseled, with severed heads and broken arms, a heartbreaking sight. The large relief in the Binyang Middle Cave: "Emperor and Empress Worshipping Buddha," was bribed in 1935 by the American robber Pleus through the antique merchant Yue Bin and the Kuomintang reactionaries, who chiseled down the entire piece and transported it to the United States. It is now displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City. The pair of lively and magnificent stone lions in front of the Wanfo Cave were also stolen by the American imperialists and displayed in the Boston Museum. We must settle this account, we must recover these treasures!
    When the Liberation War entered the stage of a full-scale offensive, the Liu-Deng army crossed the Yellow River, and the first city liberated in 1948 was Luoyang. Since the red flag was raised on the city walls, this ancient and troubled city has regained its youth. In 1953, as a heavy industrial construction city, Luoyang began its true golden age. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the Soviet Union, industrial development progressed rapidly, with major industrial sectors including machinery, steel, coal, electricity...blooming everywhere. Before long, it had become unrecognizable. From a consumer city with less than 100,000 people at the time of liberation, it has now become a production city with 500,000 people. The original old city has retreated to a corner, as a testimony to the backwardness and suffering of old Luoyang. The new urban area is extending outward, extending into the distance. Leaving the West Gate, one can no longer find the desolate and declining wilderness, but can see broad asphalt roads shaded by white poplars and green parasol trees, with a constant flow of traffic passing over the Zhongzhou Bridge. Along both sides of the dozens of miles long Zhongzhou Road and Youyi Road, streets are crisscrossed and rows of red buildings are lined up. Huge chimneys, as dense as a forest, use rich colors to depict the spring of the motherland in the sky. In the morning, the song "The East is Red" accompanies the rising sun; at night, thousands of lights sparkle, as if the Milky Way has fallen from the nine heavens. In the sea of lights, in the roar of machines, the blue sparks of electric welding and the red light often flicker and move. The First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, of which the people of Luoyang are proud, is located here. There are many brother factories near it. Here, rivers of machines, steel, cement, electricity, and thermal energy are surging day and night, connecting with the construction veins of the whole country.
    On Mangshan Mountain, "where all the graves of Luoyang people are located," the Mangling Grand Canal was built, irrigating the land that was "dry nine years out of ten." On the small paths where my fellow villagers walked creakingly carrying urine buckets, huge sewage pipes were installed; the pebble roads where rickshaw pullers ran barefoot have become asphalt roads where buses honk and drive long; on the Luo River where old boatmen used to call out the numbers while ferrying, the second Luo River bridge is rising like a steel rainbow; the 1,000-kilometer-long Luo-Yi Railway will pass through here, reaching Yidu, Hubei directly through the Pingdingshan coal sea; the graveyards and wilderness where foxes and rabbits used to appear are filled with cultural palaces, shopping malls, cinemas, parks, bookstores, medical colleges, engineering colleges...
    The people of Luoyang are living a happy life. The great poet Bai Juyi's legacy of "Striving to get a large fur coat ten thousand feet long, to cover the entire city of Luoyang with you" and the great ideals of countless revolutionary martyrs have been realized.
    Dear readers, in the past, when you mentioned Luoyang, you may have only thought of its White Horse Temple. Today, when you see the "Dongfanghong" iron oxen running and singing in the fields of the commune, please remember their hometown! Their hometown has shaken off the dark dust of history and become a radiant socialist industrial base!

    铁牛白马话洛阳
    向东
    这几天，洛阳城乡的人们，全在谈论拖拉机厂开工的大喜讯，像谈论勤劳美丽的姑娘那样，称赞着“东方红”牌拖拉机。从拖拉机厂破土动工的第一天起，它就成了洛阳人民的骄子，成了人们经常关心经常谈论的题目，如今，它正式跨上祖国社会主义经济建设的骏马了，怎不叫它的故乡人加倍地欢欣鼓舞呢？洛阳古城，又增添了多少春色！
    提到洛阳，人们都会想起它悠长的历史。它在二千年前，就成为东周的首都，后来的一千年间，先后成为九个朝代的都城，是我国历史上建都时间最长的一个古城。
    她风景佳丽。盛时有“天下名园重洛阳”之称誉。如西晋石崇的金谷园，唐李德裕的平泉别墅，北宋邵康节的安乐窝，司马光的独乐园，都盛极一时。洛阳的牡丹，更是好得出奇，久有“洛阳牡丹甲天下”的盛名。唐宋诗人作家，简直把它当作重要的创作主题。欧阳修、胡元质有牡丹记，舒元舆、徐渭有牡丹赋，张说、杨诚庵等有牡丹歌。洛阳人爱花成俗，洛阳名园记上说：“至花时……，城中仕女，绝烟火游之……”从白乐天的“帝城春欲暮，喧喧车马度，共道牡丹时，相随买花去……”的诗中可以想见当时的情景。苏东坡的“一朵妖红醉欲流，春光回照雪霜羞，化工只欲呈新巧，不放闲人得少休，”竟把洛阳牡丹写得那样的魅人！
    提起洛阳，谁能不想起我国三大石刻艺术宝库之一——龙门？山崖石洞内遍琢佛像，大者十余丈，小者不盈寸，栩栩如生，仪态万千。提起洛阳，谁能不想起我国的佛教发源地——白马寺？它是一千八百多年前（东汉永平11年），用白马从印度驮经回来后建立的第一个寺院。魏唐时，寺僧多至千余人，每天清晨和黄昏，诵经撞钟之声，悠扬远闻。长期以来，为人民所保护，历经千百年，至今犹巍然独存。提起洛阳，也不能不使人想起许多诗人作家的名字。李白的很多诗提到洛阳。“谁家玉笛暗飞声，散入春风满洛城……”勾起了他的思乡之情。杜甫自幼在洛阳读书，当他晚年流浪梓州，听说官军收复河南河北时，写下了那惊心动魄的名诗：“剑外忽传收蓟北，初闻涕泪满衣裳，……即从巴峡穿巫峡，便下襄阳向洛阳。”他对故乡洛阳怀着多么深切的感情啊。这首诗后来不知打动过多少乱世流亡者的心。白居易在洛阳龙门的香山上住了十八年，在这里写下了许多诗篇，死时还嘱家人把他埋在香山上。傅毅的“洛都赋”，张衡的“东京赋”，左太冲的“三都赋”，都对洛阳作过辉煌的描述。晋人争着抄左思的“三都赋”，一时竟弄得“洛阳纸贵”。然而，他们虽然才华绝代，比起今天的英雄们，却还是免不了逊色。在大跃进的年代里，洛阳劳动人民中涌现出来的歌手和诗篇，何止万千！这些诗篇并没有使洛阳的纸价上涨，但是它们反映了社会主义的时代，描述了社会主义洛阳的面貌。
    洛阳是我国古代政治、经济、文化的中心，曾经放射过夺目的异采。然而唐朝之后就日渐衰落，金元时代破坏尤惨。仅存的一些建筑，又遭到军阀、蒋介石匪帮和帝国主义的摧残。依靠英美势力的反动军阀吴佩孚，长期盘据洛阳，在西工修筑营房，招兵买马，祸国殃民，1923年制造“二七”惨案，屠杀京汉铁路大罢工工人的密令就是从这里发出的。1932年，“一二八”事变后，国民党反动政府在日本帝国主义的恫吓下，仓惶迁都洛阳，劳民伤财，又极大的玷污了这个古城。抗日战争时期，在蒋介石消极抗日，积极反共的政策下，带着“红膏药块”的日本飞机，几乎天天都把成吨成吨的炸弹、燃烧弹向这个古城倾泻，不久又印上了日寇的铁蹄。
    在国民党统治时期的洛阳，民生雕蔽，全部工业只不过是一个五百瓩的发电厂，和一个设备简陋的龙门煤矿。人民受着屈辱和压迫，过着悲惨的生活。大路上，破庙里到处躺着黄泛区逃来的难民，啼饥号寒、卖儿卖女，不知有多少人饿死冻死或在扒车逃命时摔死在车轮下。群众中流传着“洛河夜哭”的故事：多情的洛河，一到夜晚就呜咽的哭了，她流的是劳动人民的眼泪！她哭得那样悲恸，把雄伟的邙山惊醒，大声呼喊：哭有什么用，还是勇敢的咆哮吧，冲走人民的苦难！于是，洛河改变了性格，她变得坚强勇敢起来。那时白马寺里住满了伪军，成为禁地。龙门的石佛，被大肆盗凿，断头残臂，目不忍睹。宾阳中洞的大幅浮雕：“帝后礼佛图”，1935年被美国强盗普利斯贿通古玩奸商岳彬及国民党反动派，整幅的凿下来，运往美国，现在陈列在美国纽约市艺术博物馆和堪城纳尔逊艺术馆里。万佛洞前那对活泼雄壮的石狮子也被美帝盗去，陈列在波士顿博物馆中。我们一定要清算这笔账，我们一定要讨回这些?宝！
    当解放战争进入全面进攻阶段，刘邓大军横渡黄河，1948年解放的第一个城市就是洛阳。自从城头上升起了红旗，这古老而多难的城市又恢复了青春。1953年，作为一个重工业建设城市，洛阳开始了她真正的黄金时代。在党的领导和苏联的帮助下，工业的发展一日千里，主要工业部门有机械、钢铁、煤炭、电力……遍地开花。曾几何时，它已经变得不能辨认了。解放时，不到十万人口的消费城市，现在已成了拥有五十万人的生产城。原来的旧城，已经退居一隅，作为旧洛阳落后、苦难的见证。新的市区在向外伸延，伸延到远方。走出西门，再也找不到那荒烟衰草的野地，但见白杨碧梧掩映着宽阔的柏油路，车水马龙驶过中州桥。沿着几十里长的中州路和友谊路两旁，街道纵横红色的楼房鳞次栉比，巨大的烟囱，密如森林，用浓重的色采在天际描绘着祖国的春天。早晨，东方红的歌曲伴着太阳上升；入夜，灯火万点，好像银河落下九天。在灯河里，在机器的轰鸣声中，不时有蓝色的电焊火花隐现和红色的火光游动。洛阳人引以为骄傲的第一拖拉机制造厂就在这里。在它的附近还有很多兄弟工厂。这里正日日夜夜奔腾着机器、钢铁、水泥、电力、热能……的河流，与全国的建设脉络相通。
    在那“尽是洛阳人首墓”的邙山上，修起了邙岭大渠，灌溉着“十年九旱”的土地。在我的乡亲们挑着尿桶伊伊嘎嘎行走的小道上，安上了巨大的污水管；那人力车夫赤着脚奔跑的石子路变成了公共汽车鸣笛长驰的柏油路；在那老船工喊着号子摆渡的洛河上，第二座洛河大桥像钢铁长虹一样正在升起；长达一千公里的洛、宜铁路，就要从这里通过，经平顶山煤海直达湖北的宜都；在那过去狐兔出没的坟场、野地，布满了文化宫、商场、电影院、公园、书店、医学院、工学院……。
    洛阳人民过着幸福的生活。伟大诗人白居易那“争得大裘长万丈，与君都盖洛阳城”的遗志和多少革命先烈的伟大理想，已经实现了。
    亲爱的读者们，过去，提到洛阳，你也许只想到它的白马寺，今天，当你看到“东方红”铁牛在公社的田野里奔驰歌唱的时候，请你记住它们的故乡吧！它们的故乡啊，已经抖落历史的阴暗尘埃，成为一个容光焕发的社会主义工业基地了！
