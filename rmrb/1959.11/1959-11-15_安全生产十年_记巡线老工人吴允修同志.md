Ten Years of Safe Production
——Remembering Comrade Wu Yunxiu, Veteran Line Patroller

Comrade Wu Yunxiu is a line patroller at the Transmission Workshop of the Jilin Electric Power Bureau. In the old society, he lived a life of hunger and cold, oppressed and exploited. After the liberation of Jilin, he began to live a real human life, standing tall as a master of the country, and soon honorably joined the Communist Party of China.

Line patrolling is a key to ensuring safe power supply. High-voltage overhead transmission lines are exposed to the elements, enduring rain, snow, lightning, and ice. They may also encounter natural disasters such as floods and fires. Poor maintenance can easily lead to power outages. Line patrol items include conductors, insulators, insulator pins, etc. above; poles, guy wires, trees, small bridges, and dikes below... In this complex work, Comrade Wu Yunxiu diligently studied and created working methods such as "walk three sides, look four sides, look ahead, look back, stop in the middle to observe," and "clear division of labor, mutual cooperation, cross-patrolling, defect comparison." These methods have been learned and promoted by line patrol personnel in the Jilin Electric Power Bureau and many transmission lines in the national electric power system since 1953. However, he is never satisfied or arrogant. He humbly asks others for advice and also learned from experiences such as using mirrors to inspect equipment defects, mastering water level data, indicating charts for how large a wire can carry what load, and comparative tables of defect handling results, making great contributions to ensuring safe power supply.

Line patrolling is very hard work, involving long walks in mountainous areas and open fields, day and night, going through water and mud. One can't wear dry clothes for ten and a half days. In the pitch-black night, they also frequently perform night patrol tasks. In this difficult environment, Wu Yunxiu is always cheerful, enthusiastic, and conscientious. Once, the Ji-Mo line experienced a power outage. When tapping the shunt line, he suggested: "Let's check all the components while we're at it." Others were afraid there wouldn't be enough time, so they didn't check, but he checked himself and found that the steel-aluminum joint on the right jumper wire of pole number 185 was burned. He immediately attached a jumper wire to prevent a line break. The newly built Re-Ji No. 1 iron tower had already been inspected and accepted. After he took over, he still climbed up the tower, inspecting it up and down, left and right, every step of the way. At the top of the 15-meter-high tower, he found that an insulator pin was missing and immediately took care of it. The insulator pin is attached to the insulator and the wire clip; without it, the insulator pin could be pulled out, causing the insulator to fall off and the line to break.

Another time, on his way home from work, he suddenly saw a bird's nest on a pole across the river. Bird's nests are most likely to cause accidents. He thought, "What a great loss to the country if an accident occurs because of this!" He forgot his fatigue and disregarded the coldness of early spring. He immediately took off his cotton pants, grabbed an insulated pole, jumped into the icy Songhua River, waded across, and removed the bird's nest.

Since 1958, basic construction projects have greatly increased. Many construction units often excavate earthwork near the lines. Construction between power poles can easily cause accidents, so he painstakingly studied and tried to find solutions. In addition to conducting publicity and explanations to workers during line patrols, he also took the initiative to contact construction units. He also made mobile boards, drew diagrams of the distance between lines and obstacles, the hazards, and precautions, and hung them at construction sites for publicity. He made sure that all units working under the lines contacted him in advance, preventing external damage accidents and ensuring the safe operation of the lines.

Comrade Wu Yunxiu is so conscientious, never negligent, diligently studying, learning, working hard, and working cleverly, consistently working hard in the line patrol post. The twelve lines under his charge, totaling forty-one kilometers in length, thirty-seven wooden poles, and two hundred and one iron towers, have never had any accidents in more than ten years.

    安全生产十年
    ——记巡线老工人吴允修同志
    吴允修同志是吉林电业局送电工区的巡线工人。在旧社会里，他一直过着受人压迫和剥削的饥寒交迫的生活。吉林解放后，他才开始过真正的人的生活，挺起腰板做了国家的主人，并且很快就光荣地参加了中国共产党。
    巡线工作是安全供电的一个关键。高压架空输电线路是设立在露天之下的，长期受雨、雪、雷电、复冰的侵袭，有时还会遇到水灾、火灾等自然灾害，维护不好，容易发生停电事故。巡线的项目，上有导线、磁瓶、肖子针等；下有电杆、拉线、树木、小桥和水堤……。在这项目复杂的工作中，吴允修同志刻苦钻研，创造了“三面走，四面瞧，往前瞻，回头看，走到中间站一站”、“分工明确，互相配合，交叉巡线，缺陷对照”等工作方法。这些方法，从1953年开始就为吉林电业局和全国电业系统许多输电线路的巡线人员学习推广了，但他从不满足和骄傲，虚心请教别人，又学习了用镜子照设备缺陷、掌握水位资料、多大线条配载多大负荷的指示图、处理缺陷成绩比较表等经验，对保证安全供电做出了很大贡献。
    巡线工作是十分艰苦的，长期奔走在山区旷野，没早没晚，水里去，泥里来。十天半月的穿不上干衣服。在漆黑的深夜里，他们还要经常执行夜巡任务。在这艰苦的环境中，吴允修始终是精神愉快、情绪饱满、认真负责。有一次，吉莫线停电，打分流线时，他提出：“捎带把各部件检查一下。”别的人怕时间不够用，没有去检查，他就自己检查，结果，发现了一百八十五号右边跳线上钢铝接头烧伤，当即打上背线，防止了断线事故。新建的热吉一号铁塔，已做了验收，他接管以后，仍然把着铁塔向上爬，每上一节都上上下下左左右右地检查一遍，在十五米高的铁塔顶端，发现肖子针没有了，当即作了处理。肖子针是别在磁瓶和夹线之间的肖子上的，没有它就可能发生肖子拔出磁瓶脱落断线事故。
    还有一次，他在工余往家走时，忽然看到江那边的一根电杆上有一鸟巢，鸟巢是最容易引起事故的，心想“万一因此发生事故，将给国家造成多大的损失呀！”他忘记了疲累，也不顾初春的寒冷，立即脱下棉裤，拿着绝缘棒，跳进冰冷的松花江水中趟了过去，把鸟巢弄下来。
    1958年以来，基本建设工程大大增加。许多施工单位，常在线路附近挖土方工程。在电杆中间施工是容易引起事故的，于是他苦心钻研想办法，除在巡线时向工人进行宣传解释外，并主动与施工单位具体联系。他还制造了流动板，画上线路与障碍物的距离和危害性及注意事项，挂在施工地点进行宣传。做到了凡在线路下面施工的单位都事先联系，防止了外力破坏事故，保证了线路安全运行。
    吴允修同志就是这样兢兢业业，没有一刻疏忽大意，苦钻、苦学、苦干、巧干，始终如一地在巡线岗位上努力工作着。他所担负的总长四十一公里的十二条线路，三十七基木杆，二百零一基铁塔，十余年来从未发生过任何事故。
