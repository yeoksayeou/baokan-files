Xinhua News Agency, November 4th. The State Council Vice Premier Li Fuchun held a banquet this evening to entertain the heads of Soviet experts assisting China in its socialist construction, warmly celebrating the 42nd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution.

At the banquet filled with the atmosphere of internationalist friendship, State Council Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Bo Yibo, and heads of various departments cordially conversed with Fumin, the head of the Soviet experts, Sudarikov and Androsov from the Soviet Embassy in China, as well as the assistants of the expert leaders, and repeatedly raised their glasses to congratulate the Soviet Union on its brilliant achievements in communist construction and to wish for the continuous development of the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun spoke first at the banquet, extending warm festive greetings to everyone. Vice Premier Li Fuchun said that the victory of the October Revolution opened a new era in human history and paved the broad road to communism for all mankind. Over the past forty-two years, this road has become increasingly broad, and the thought of Marxism-Leninism and the brilliance of communism will ultimately triumph and illuminate every corner of the world.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun praised the glorious achievements of the Soviet Union in building communism in his speech. He said that we are very pleased to see that the Soviet people are victoriously implementing the magnificent Seven-Year Plan and are moving towards the great ideal of mankind—communism. We are very pleased to know that the Soviet Union's plan for this year will be greatly overfulfilled. The Chinese people are deeply convinced that the early realization of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan will not only lay a solid foundation for the transition to communism in terms of material and spiritual conditions but will also enrich the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism with valuable experience in building communism.

After narrating the achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction, Vice Premier Li Fuchun said that the people of our country clearly know that the great achievements made in our socialist construction are inseparable from the help of the Soviet Union and the hard work of Soviet experts. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to the Soviet Party and Government, the Soviet people, the comrades from the expert organizations present, and all Soviet experts.

Vice Premier Li Fuchuan said that it remained an arduous task to build China into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Learning from the Soviet Union, conscientiously studying the Soviet Union's construction experience, and modestly learning the advanced experience and scientific and technological knowledge of Soviet experts are one of the important conditions for completing the arduous task of socialist construction in our country.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun finally said that the Soviet people are the most reliable and most loyal friends of the Chinese people, and the close friendship and unity between our two peoples are the fundamental guarantee for world peace and the cause of human progress. The Chinese people will always regard consolidating and developing the unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples and the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union as their sacred duty. Any imperialists and their running dogs who want to undermine our unity will never succeed.

Fumin, the head of the Soviet experts, then delivered a speech full of friendly passion. He said that forty-two years ago, the Soviet people began a new life. In the early days of construction, our country was backward and poor, but due to the will and wisdom of the Soviet proletariat, our country has now become the world's leading power, and we have made significant achievements and created miracles in all aspects. Before long, our country will surpass the United States in terms of per capita industrial and agricultural output.

When talking about the increasingly prosperous communist construction in the Soviet Union, Fumin said that the Chinese people, advancing side by side with the Soviet people, have made tremendous achievements in socialist construction, and we believe that on the road of Marxism-Leninism, the Chinese people will surely turn their country into a strong industrial country soon. He finally wished the Chinese people continuous and great achievements in socialist construction.

Among those present at the banquet were Zeng Yifan, Yang Fangzhi, Zhao Shougong, and Tong Xiaopeng, deputy secretaries-general of the State Council, and Yao Yilin, Xu Maijin, Liu Daifeng, Gu Zhuoxin, Liu Aifeng, Zhang Zhixiang, and Rong Gaotang, heads of various departments.

After the banquet, a song and dance Peking opera evening was held.

    国务院欢宴苏联专家负责人
    李富春副总理说，巩固中苏友谊是和平的根本保障
    新华社4日讯　国务院副总理李富春今天晚间举行宴会，招待帮助我国进行社会主义建设的苏联专家的负责人，热烈庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年。
    在充满国际主义友谊气氛的宴会上，国务院副总理李富春、薄一波和各部门负责人，同苏联专家负责人符明，苏联驻中国大使馆参赞苏达利柯夫，安德罗素夫以及专家负责人的助手人员，亲切交谈，并且一再举杯，祝贺苏联在共产主义建设中获得辉煌成就，祝中苏两国人民之间的牢不可破的兄弟友谊不断发展。
    李富春副总理在宴会上首先讲话，他向大家致以节日的热烈祝贺。李富春副总理说，十月革命的胜利，为人类历史开创了新纪元，为全人类开辟了通向共产主义的康庄大道。四十二年以来，这条道路已越来越广阔，马克思列宁主义的思想、共产主义的光芒必将最终胜利，照亮全世界的每一个角落。
    李富春副总理在讲话中盛赞苏联建设共产主义的辉煌成就。他说，我们十分高兴地看到，苏联人民正在胜利地执行着宏伟的七年计划，正在向着人类的伟大理想——共产主义迈进。我们十分高兴地知道，苏联今年的计划将大大地超额完成。中国人民深信：苏联七年计划将提前实现，这不仅为过渡到共产主义在物质条件和精神条件方面打下巩固的基础，而且将以建设共产主义的宝贵经验，丰富马克思列宁主义的宝库。
    李富春副总理叙述了中国人民社会主义建设的成就后说，我国人民清楚地知道，我国社会主义建设事业中所取得的伟大成就是与苏联的帮助和苏联专家们的辛勤劳动分不开的。我愿意借此机会向苏联党和政府、苏联人民和在座的专家组织方面的各位同志，以及全体苏联专家们，表示衷心的感谢。
    李富春副总理说，要把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，摆在我们面前的任务仍然是艰巨的。向苏联学习，认真学习苏联的建设经验，虚心地学习苏联专家的先进经验和科学技术知识，是完成我国社会主义建设的艰巨任务的重要条件之一。
    李富春副总理最后说，苏联人民是中国人民最可靠、最忠实的朋友，我们两国人民之间的亲密友谊和团结一致是世界和平和人类进步事业的根本保障。中国人民永远把巩固和发展中苏两国人民的团结和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，当作自己的神圣责任。任何帝国主义和他们的走狗，想要破坏我们的这种团结，是永远不会得逞的。
    苏联专家负责人符明接着发表了充满友谊激情的讲话。他说，四十二年前，苏联人民开始了新的生活。在建设初期，我们的国家是落后、贫困的，但是由于苏联无产阶级的意志和智慧，我们的国家现在已经成了世界上的头等强国，我们在各方面都取得了重大成就，创造了奇迹。不用很久，我们国家就将在按人口计算的工农业产量方面超过美国。
    符明在讲到苏联日益蓬勃发展的共产主义建设的时候说，同苏联人民并肩前进的中国人民，在社会主义建设中取得了巨大成就，我们相信，在马克思列宁主义的道路上，中国人民一定会很快使自己的国家变成强大的工业国。他最后祝中国人民在社会主义建设中不断取得巨大成就。
    出席宴会作陪的，有国务院副秘书长曾一凡、杨放之、赵守攻、童小鹏，各部门负责人姚依林、徐迈进、刘岱峰、顾卓新、刘皑风、张致祥、荣高棠等。
