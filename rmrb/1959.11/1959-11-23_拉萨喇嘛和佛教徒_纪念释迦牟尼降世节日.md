Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, November 22nd: Lamas and Buddhists in Lhasa today commemorated the anniversary of the birth of Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism (known as "Lhaba" in Tibetan), in accordance with traditional customs.

    In the early morning, lamas from Lhasa's three major monasteries—Drepung, Sera, and Ganden—as well as the four major Lingka monasteries and the Jokhang Temple, gathered at the Jokhang Temple to recite the "Nai Tang Chagjue Jing" (Sutra of Celebrating the People's New Life and Happiness). Thirty-four large golden lamps and tens of thousands of butter lamps were lit in front of the statue of Sakyamuni; incense was burned on the altar of the Jokhang Temple.

    In addition to the lamas, many Buddhist believers from Lhasa and the surrounding rural and pastoral areas entered the Jokhang Temple to light lamps, offer hadas, and pay homage to the statue of Sakyamuni, performing sacrificial rites.

    Today, Tibetan Buddhist believers in Lhasa's urban areas also performed songs, dances, and other artistic programs on the streets, expressing their gratitude for the Chinese Communist Party's policy of freedom of religious belief.
