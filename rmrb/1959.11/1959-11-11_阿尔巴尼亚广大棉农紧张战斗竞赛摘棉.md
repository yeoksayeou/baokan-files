    Tirana Dispatch: Albanian cotton farmers are currently engaged in an intense battle to harvest cotton. By the end of last month, the amount of new cotton stored in the country's warehouses was equivalent to more than 42% of the annual plan.

    October is the season for cotton to mature in Albania, and it is also just before the rainy season and cold waves arrive. Therefore, this month is crucial for the cotton harvest. Since the end of September, tens of thousands of farmers in the seven major cotton-producing areas have been starting early and working late to fight against time. So far, the Fieri and Durrës cotton-producing areas have delivered more than 38,000 quintals of cotton to the state.

    Many cooperatives have also established cotton picking incentive systems in order to complete the cotton picking work as soon as possible. The Agricultural Cooperative named after Mao Zedong originally planned to deliver 510 quintals of cotton to the state this year. The members are preparing to hand in 200 quintals more to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of the motherland (November 29). In mid-October, a national conference of outstanding cotton pickers was held to observe and exchange cotton-picking experiences, and a cotton-picking competition was conducted.

    阿尔巴尼亚广大棉农紧张战斗竞赛摘棉
    本报地拉那10日电　阿尔巴尼亚广大棉农正在投入一场紧张的收摘棉花的战斗中。到上月底为止，全国入仓的新棉已相当于全年计划的42％以上。
    10月份是阿尔巴尼亚棉花成熟的季节，也是雨季和寒流即将到来的前夕，因此这个月对棉花的收获具有决定性的意义。从9月底起，七个主要产棉区每天都有数万农民起早贪黑地展开了抢时间的战斗。到目前为止，费里和都拉斯两个产棉区已上交给国家三万八千多公担棉花。
    不少合作社为了及早完成摘棉工作，还制定了摘棉奖励制度。以毛泽东命名的农业合作社今年原计划交给国家五百一十公担棉花。社员为迎接祖国解放十五周年（11月29日）准备多上交二百公担。为观摩和交流摘棉经验，10月中旬举行了全国优秀摘棉手会议，并进行了摘棉评比。
