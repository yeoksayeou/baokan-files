    Promoting Effectively

    Paying attention to strengthening weak links in a timely manner and promoting an all-round leap forward in production is a regular task for enterprise leaders. The leading comrades of Taiyuan City used the method of on-site promotion meetings to solve specific problems in the production of weak departments, and the effect was very good. This shows that on-site promotion meetings are a good method.

    The process of the development of things is often a process of repeated cycles from imbalance to balance, and from balance to new imbalance. The emergence of weak links in work is a reflection of this law of unbalanced development of things. In all work, and in every stage of the work, weak links appear from time to time. When the entire production and construction is advancing at a higher speed, individual units cannot keep up with the pace of progress and become weak links. This is a common phenomenon and is not surprising at all. However, just because it is a common phenomenon does not mean that weak links can be left to their own devices. Although weak links are only individual links, our work is an organic whole, and if one department or one link cannot keep up, it will affect the whole. Therefore, the leadership's attention should be focused on both the advanced parts and the weak parts. Grasping the advanced parts can drive the backward parts, and grasping the backward parts can promote the advanced parts to become more advanced, and the backward parts will quickly catch up.

    On-site promotion is a form of promotion that combines external forces with internal forces and is aimed at weak links. The basic construction of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company was slow due to the unresolved weak links of construction forces and equipment. After the recent on-site promotion meeting, 18 units organized "support troops." The three major projects of Taiyuan Iron and Steel are likely to be completed and put into production three months ahead of schedule. Weak links are transformed into their opposite, becoming a positive factor driving the leap forward in other areas. Facts have proved that on-site promotion meetings have various conditions that facilitate the analysis of contradictions: first, facing the scene can prevent the superficiality and one-sidedness of the original understanding, achieve the unity of subjective and objective, and the leaders' opinions will be specific, practical and powerful; second, absorb comrades from various relevant departments to participate, pool ideas, and work together to break through a weak link, affecting many weak links; third, leaders and workers work together in unity, making it easy to put the problem on the table, facilitating the mobilization of the masses, and enabling the weak links to be resolved as soon as possible.

    A good leader should not only be good at grasping the advanced to drive the backward, but also be good at breaking through weak links to seek new balance and improve production. In this way, the torrent of the increase production and practice economy movement can surge forward wave after wave.

    促进有方
    及时注意加强薄弱环节，促进生产全面跃进，这是企业领导人员的经常工作。太原市领导同志运用现场促进会的方法，解决薄弱部门生产中的具体问题，效果很好。说明现场促进会是一个好的方法。
    事物的发展过程，往往是由不平衡到平衡，又由平衡到新的不平衡的反复循环的过程。工作中出现薄弱环节，正是这种事物发展不平衡规律的反映。在各项工作中，在工作进行的每个阶段中，都不时地有薄弱环节出现，当整个生产建设以更高的速度前进的时候，个别单位跟不上前进的速度，变成薄弱环节，这是经常的现象，是丝毫不奇怪的。但是，说它是经常现象，并不是说对薄弱环节可以放任自流。虽然薄弱环节只是个别环节，但是我们的工作是个有机的整体，一个部门一个环节跟不上，就要影响整体。所以，领导方面的注意力，既要放在先进部分，又要抓住薄弱部分。抓先进部分可以带动落后部分，抓住落后部分可以促使先进的更加先进，落后的很快赶上去。
    现场促进，是外部力量同内部力量相结合，对准薄弱环节的一种促进形式。太原钢铁公司的基本建设由于施工力量和设备等薄弱环节没有解决，工程进度缓慢。最近一次现场促进会以后，有十八个单位组织了“支援军”，太钢的三大工程，就有可能比原计划提前三个月全部建成投入生产。薄弱环节转化到它的对立面，成为带动其他方面跃进的积极因素。事实证明：现场促进会具有种种条件便于解剖矛盾：第一、面对现场，可以防止原先认识的表面性和片面性，达到主观与客观的统一，领导的意见便会具体、切实、有力；第二、吸收各有关部门的同志参加，集思广益，通力协作，突破一个薄弱环节，影响很多的薄弱环节；第三、领导人员同工人打成一片，团结无间，容易把问题摆出来，便于动员群众的力量，使薄弱环节早日解决。
    一个好的领导者，不仅要善于抓住先进来带动落后，而且要善于突破薄弱环节，求得新的平衡，把生产提高一步。这样，就能使增产节约运动的洪流一浪高一浪地汹涌前进。
