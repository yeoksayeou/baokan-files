    Hard-Won Harvest!
    Chen Yinchi
    Recently, the weather has turned sharply colder, but the reservoir construction site in Yingfeng Commune, Yiyang, Hunan, is still buzzing with activity.
    Here, a reservoir with a surface area of nearly 5,000 mu and a capacity of over 26.6 million cubic meters will be built by damming the mountains. Next spring, the water stored here will irrigate more than 40,000 mu of fertile land in Yingfeng Commune through canals and branch canals. Guo Yuting, the first secretary of the Party committee, said: "With this reservoir, even if we have another hundred days of severe drought next year, our grain and cash crops will have an even bigger harvest than this year." Speaking of winning a harvest after a hundred days of drought, Secretary Guo's eyebrows radiated a heroic expression.
          A Great Harvest Despite Severe Drought
    This heroism is the collective emotion of more than 30,000 commune members and cadres. It was they who fought bitterly against the drought for more than 120 days when the severe drought of over a hundred days came, and finally won the harvest. The entire commune's more than 25,000 mu of early rice yielded 450 jin per mu; 5,300 mu of mid-season rice yielded 365 jin per mu; 18,000 mu of single-season late rice yielded 814 jin per mu; more than 25,000 mu of late rice broke the convention, surpassing early and mid-season rice, yielding 564 jin per mu; summer sweet potatoes and autumn miscellaneous grains all achieved a bumper harvest; cash crops such as jute and cotton also achieved high yields. The total grain output increased by 35% compared to 1958. This miracle shocked people far and wide!
    Yingfeng Commune is a hilly area with overlapping small mountains and hills. It has some plains near the suburbs of Yiyang City. Because of poor water conservancy conditions, it has historically been a drought-prone area. This year, from more than 20 days after the early rice was transplanted until the rush harvesting of double-cropping late rice was completed, it only rained once in more than 120 days. Some places moistened the soil, while others did not receive a single drop of rain. The commune's Party committee led the commune members in an earth-shattering hundred-day struggle against drought.
    In July, the early rice was waiting to be harvested, the late rice was waiting to be transplanted, the mid-season rice was in the flowering and grain-filling stage, and the single-season late rice was budding. Cash crops such as cotton and jute were in their peak growing period, and none of them could be short of water. At this time, the commune's Party committee made a decision: we must lead the masses to seize an all-round harvest, and put forward the fighting slogan: "Fighting drought is like fighting the enemy, protecting seedlings is like protecting life, and everything must be guaranteed to be a bumper harvest" as the program of action for the entire commune.
    The headquarters for rush harvesting and planting was established, and the commune Party secretary, brigade general branch secretaries, and cadres all went deep into the front lines. The entire commune unified the dispatch of troops and generals, rationally arranged labor, consolidated, improved, and organized more than 400 childcare groups and kindergartens, enabling more than 6,000 female laborers to participate in the fight against drought. During the days of "double rush," more than 20,000 people went into battle, harvesting one plot, carting one plot, turning one plot, and planting one plot, cooperating with each other in assembly-line operations. During the day, they were not afraid of sweating under the scorching sun; at night, lanterns and torches lit up the fields. They worked continuously for more than ten days and nights, finally seized the season, resisted the summer drought, and victoriously completed the rush harvesting and planting tasks on more than 20,000 mu of land before the Beginning of Autumn.
    The autumn drought was fiercer and more severe than the summer drought. The strong south wind kept blowing, the fields were so dry that cracks more than two inches wide appeared, and the tips of the rice plants were burned red in some places. The water poured into the fields hissed. The serious thing was that the entire commune had no water to save the fields, and even some canteens had difficulty getting drinking water.
    At this critical moment, the commune's Party committee firmly put forward the fighting slogan "Guarantee a bumper harvest with no rain for a hundred days," and the secretary took the lead in finding water sources. The entire commune mobilized 20,000 laborers and 1,800 waterwheels to launch an unprecedented large-scale anti-drought battle. Secretary Guo Yuting led 10,000 people to fight at Huangjia Lake. There were more than 200 wheel wharves along the line, and the waterwheels were connected one after another, forming long dragons like fish biting tails, turning the water from Huangjia Lake, which was twelve miles away, over thirteen ridges and one hundred and sixty-three mountains to irrigate the fields of six brigades including Beishilun and Dongshan. Secretary Peng Chunsheng led more than 500 laborers to march towards the Zi River. In addition, forces were also organized to dig wells and find springs.
            Great Battle on the Zi River
    Dear readers, would you like to know about the battles of heroes and heroines on the Zi River?
    The four electric water pumps installed on the Jiecheng embankment of the Zi River tributary were becoming more and more difficult to operate, and it was clear that the river water was getting shallower. The commune Party committee decided to cooperate with Changchun Commune, mobilizing 180 waterwheels and more than 1,000 people to form a long snake formation in the center of the tributary, extending the waterwheels to the inlets to meet the pumping needs of the water pumps. The water pumps brought the water up, passing through Jiecheng Brigade of Changchun Commune, which was near the Zi River. Yingfeng Commune then used a series of waterwheels to transport the water to Bailupu, Zhoujiashan, and finally to Niujia Lun, twelve miles away. Whenever a stream of Zi River water flowed into the fields of Niujia Lun, the commune members were both grateful and excited.
    In September, the water in the Zi River became shallower and shallower, and there was no source of water flow in the river inlets. Hundreds of people wheeled water continuously for seven days and seven nights, but the water pumps were still gasping for air. The water could not meet its needs. Several communes decided to cut off the main stream of the Zi River and build a dam to block the river. In just five days, people completed a fifteen-meter-long dam in the center of the river, raising the water level upstream of the Zi River by one meter. Coupled with the rise in water upstream, the water in the tributaries visibly increased, and the water pumps once again "thumped, thumped, thumped" as they swallowed the river water and spat it out into the canals on the bank, flowing towards the vast fields.
            Find All Underground Water
    "Find all underground water and save ten thousand mu of grain" is the ambition of the commune members of Yingfeng Brigade.
    This brigade had completely lost its water source, and more than 8,000 mu of the brigade's more than 10,000 mu of fields had dried up. How to save them? After the general Party branch mobilized the masses to discuss, it decided to find water underground, putting forward methods such as "finding, digging, dredging, carrying, conserving, and adjusting." The water exploration team led by the brigade leader was established, and their footprints were everywhere along the canals, mountain ridges, and fields. The masses also actively offered suggestions for finding water. Gong Bochu, an old farmer in Baiyin Village who was over seventy years old, broke the superstition of fearing to dig dragon wells for fear of violating "taboos" and told the Party member Zeng Zhaofu about a "dragon well." Lao Zeng immediately led the commune members to dig, and after digging more than ten feet deep, a stream of water finally gushed out. The brigade mobilized the masses to widely dig wells and find springs, irrigating nearly 2,000 mu of fields.
    The drought was severe, and every drop of water was as precious as gold. The brigade also put forward the slogan "One drop of water, one dan of grain, carrying water harvests ten thousand jin of grain," and organized a water-carrying team of more than 6,000 people, using buckets and water buckets to carry water to irrigate the seedlings. The single-season late rice fields in Xintang Production Team had cracks two or three inches wide, and the rice leaves were rolled up. The brigade's general Party branch transferred labor from Xinhua, Baiyin, Shiniutang, and Yingfengqiao to support Xintang Team. People went to Hanshou, seven miles away, to carry water.
    In order to conserve water, wooden basins, water tanks, and buckets that could store water were placed everywhere beside the fields and on the edges of the land to store the carried water. At night, the commune members responsible for sprinkling would evenly sprinkle the water on the rice leaves. Many scattered high-lying drylands were irrigated by auxiliary laborers using kettles, one seedling at a time, to keep them moist. The water used by the commune members for washing their faces and bodies was not wasted, but stored and sprinkled into the fields.
    Here, every mu of field, every inch of soil where crops can win a bumper harvest, how much hard work has been spent!
                            ＊　　＊　　＊
    At the end of October, after a welcome rain, the autumn drought was relieved, and the anti-drought battle that lasted more than 110 days ended. The commune was filled with joy and celebration of the harvest. People describe this year's prosperous scene like this:
    The commune is truly strong, with rice, cotton, and hemp fragrant everywhere;
    First, the Party's leadership is good, and second, the general line shines brightly;
    If it were the "Republican Year of Yichou," where would there be clothes or grain;
    This year, we fought drought for more than a hundred days, and we are happy and well-fed.

    丰收来之不易！
    陈茵池
    近来，天气骤冷，但在湖南益阳迎丰公社的水库工地上，却显得热气腾腾。
    这里将拦山筑起一座水面近五千亩，容量二千六百多万立方米的水库。明年春天，这里积蓄的水将通过干渠、支渠，自流灌溉迎丰公社的四万多亩沃土良田。党委第一书记郭余庭说：“有了这座水库，明年再来个百日大旱，我们的粮食、经济作物，要比今年获得更大丰收。”说到百日抗旱获得丰收，郭书记眉宇间洋溢着一股豪迈的神情。
          大旱赢丰收
    这豪情是全公社三万多社员、干部感情的汇集。当百多天酷旱来临，就是他们，和干旱苦苦战斗了一百二十天，终于赢得了丰收。全公社二万五千多亩早稻亩产四百五十斤；五千三百亩中稻亩产三百六十五斤；一万八千多亩一季晚稻亩产八百十四斤；二万五千多亩晚稻打破常规，赶过早、中稻，亩产五百六十四斤；夏红薯、秋杂粮都获得了丰收；黄麻、棉花等经济作物同样获得高产。粮食总产量比1958年增产了35％。这奇迹震惊了远近的人们！
    迎丰公社是一个丘陵地区，小山岭重重叠叠，靠近益阳市郊区有部分平原，因为水利条件差，历史上是个遭干旱的地方。今年从早稻插下二十多天起，直到双季晚稻抢收完毕的一百二十多天，只下过一次雨，有的地方润湿了一下泥土，有的地方却滴雨未下。公社党委领导着社员们与“天公”展开了一场惊天动地的百日抗旱斗争。
    7月间，早稻等着要抢收，晚稻等着要抢插，中稻正在扬花灌浆，一季晚稻正在怀苞，棉花、黄麻等经济作物正是盛长时期，哪一项都不能少水。这时，公社党委作出了决定：一定要领导群众夺取全面丰收，并提出：“抗旱如抗敌，保苗如保命，样样定要保丰收”的战斗口号，作为全公社的行动纲领。
    抢收抢插指挥部成立了，公社党委书记和大队总支书记、干部都深入前线。全公社统一调兵遣将，合理安排劳力，巩固健全和组织了四百多个托儿组、幼儿园，使六千多名妇女劳力投入抗旱斗争。在“双抢”的日子里，两万多人上阵，收一丘，车一丘，翻一丘，插一丘，互相配合，流水作业。白天，烈日当空不怕汗流浃背；夜晚，灯笼火把把四野照得通明。他们连续苦战了十来个日日夜夜，终于抢住季节，抗拒了夏旱，在立秋前胜利完成了二万多亩田的抢收抢插任务。
    秋旱比夏旱来得更猛、更加严重，大南风一个劲地吹，田里干得裂开二寸多宽的坼缝，禾尖有的烧得通红，水灌进田中嗤嗤发响。严重的是：全公社已经无水救田，甚至有些食堂吃水也发生了困难。
    公社党委在这个关键时刻，坚定地提出“百日无雨保丰收”的战斗口号，由书记挂帅寻找水源。全公社出动两万劳动大军、一千八百架水车，展开了空前规模的抗旱战斗。郭余庭书记带领一万人，奋战黄家湖。全线有二百多个车埠，水车一递连接一递，鱼咬尾地接成一条条的长龙，把十二里路外的黄家湖水翻过十三个岭、一百六十三个山头，灌溉碑石仑、东山等六个大队的田地。彭春生书记带领五百多名劳力向资水进军。除此以外，还组织力量突击挖井找泉。
            大战资江河
    亲爱的读者，你想知道英雄好汉在资江河上的战斗吗？
    资江支流接城堤口上安装的那四台电动抽水机，越来越吞吐费劲了，眼看河水浅下去了。公社党委决定与长春公社合作，出动一百八十张水车，一千多人上阵，在支流中心，摆成长蛇阵，把水车到汊口，满足抽水机的抽水需要。抽水机把水打上来，从靠临资江的长春公社的接城堤大队经过，迎丰公社再用一递接一递的水车把水车到白鹿铺、周家山，直到十二里路外的牛角仑。每当牛角仑的田野流来一股资水时，社员们又是感激又是兴奋。
    9月，资江的水越来越浅了，河汊里已经没有水的源流。几百人连续车了七天七夜，而抽水机又喘急起来。水，又不能满足它的需要了。几个公社决定斩断资江主流，拦河筑坝。仅只五天的时间，人们在河中心完成了十五米长堤坝，资江上游水位抬高了一米，加上上游涨水，支流里的水眼看着多起来，抽水机才又“突、突、突”地把江水吞进来吐到岸上的渠道里，流向辽阔的田野。
            找尽地下水
    “找尽地下水，救活万亩粮”，这是迎丰大队社员的雄心。
    这个大队已经完全断绝水源了，全大队一万多亩田已干了八千多亩。怎样救法？党总支发动群众讨论之后，决定向地下找水。提出了“找、挖、掏、挑、节、调”等办法。由大队队长领导的探水组成立了，圳边、山墈、田头，到处有他们的足迹。群众也积极献计找水。柏荫村七十多岁的老农龚柏初，打破了怕挖龙井犯“禁”的迷信，把一口“龙井”告诉了党员曾昭福。老曾立即带动社员去挖，挖到一丈多深，终于一股水流涌出来。大队发动群众广泛挖井找泉，浇灌了近二千亩田。
    旱情严重，滴水如金。大队又提出了“一点水，一担粮，担水收获万斤粮”的口号，组织了六千多人的挑水队，利用提桶、水桶挑水戽苗。新塘生产队一季晚稻田中已坼裂二、三寸宽，禾叶子卷起来了，大队党总支从新华、柏荫、石牛塘、迎丰桥调集劳力支援新塘队，人们到七里路外的汉寿去挑水。
    为了珍惜用水，田旁、地边到处摆着木盆、水缸、扮桶等能贮水的工具，把挑来的水贮存起来。到夜晚由负责泼洒的社员，均匀地把水泼到禾叶上。许多零星的高田旱地，就由那些辅助劳动力用水壶一蔸蔸地淋浇，以保持湿润。社员们洗脸、洗澡等用水，都点滴不浪费，贮存起来泼到田里去。
    在这里，每一亩田，每一寸土的作物能赢得丰收，是费去了多少辛勤劳动啊！
                            ＊　　＊　　＊
    10月底，一场喜雨过后，秋旱解除，一百一十多天的抗旱战斗结束了。公社里一片喜气洋洋，欢庆丰收。人们是这样形容今年的兴旺景象：
    公社化，真正强，稻谷棉麻遍地香；
    一是党的领导好，二是总路线放光芒；
    若是“民国乙丑年”，哪有穿来哪有粮；
    今年抗旱百多天，丰衣足食喜洋洋。
