Listen to the Party, Follow Chairman Mao
By Our Staff Reporter

More than six thousand standard-bearers of socialist construction spent fourteen joyful days together at a gathering. What an extraordinary fourteen days! The heroic deeds of our era cannot be fully described, and the great aspirations of our people cannot be fully narrated. The Party Central Committee congratulated them, Chairman Liu Shaoqi received them, and Premier Zhou Enlai hosted a banquet for them. The heroes listened to the teachings of the Party and its leaders. Heroes from all walks of life converged, thousands of advanced experiences converged, and the will and strength to build socialism converged! This was a review conference, a mobilization conference, and a swearing-in conference.

Now, the heroes will hold high the torch of high-speed socialist construction, follow the victorious path guided by the Party, unite and lead hundreds of millions of people to greet the victory of this year's continued leap forward, and prepare to greet the victory of next year's continued leap forward!

The Party Central Committee issued a great call to the heroes: unite the masses to complete this year's national economic plan ahead of schedule and over fulfill it, and on this basis, greet the victory of next year's continued leap forward; let us catch up with the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in about ten years, and let us realize the twelve-year agricultural development program ahead of schedule and rapidly build our country into great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. The Party's call excited the hearts of the heroes. "Plant the red flag on the target of new and greater victories!" More than six thousand heroes spent fourteen days with such a fighting desire. Meng Tai, a sixty-two-year-old hero from Anshan, the steel capital, told others: "We need mechanization, automation, and electrification. We must have steel to build the country well! Industry needs it, agriculture needs it, everywhere needs it.... What can we do to produce more and better steel? That's what I think about day and night!" Old hero Meng Tai told others. At the meeting, he issued a competition challenge to Peng Shihua, the Party Secretary of the No. 1 Iron Smelting Plant of the Benxi Iron and Steel Company, the national champion of large and medium-sized blast furnaces, determined to seize the champion red flag they had held for nineteen consecutive months.

Meng Tai's words and actions were full of confidence, strength, and joy. For ten years, he has dedicated all his wisdom and strength to the restoration, growth and strengthening of the first iron and steel base in the motherland. He is a man who shares the fate and breathes the same air as the motherland's iron and steel industry; he is a man who shares weal and woe with the motherland's great socialist cause. For the high-speed advancement of the iron and steel industry, he personally went to Benxi to learn advanced experience, and traveled far to the foot of Daqingshan to teach his experience to the Baotou Steel workers. The rows of medals on Meng Tai's chest are a testament to his tireless efforts to advance the motherland's iron and steel industry and the Party's cause with all his energy. This is his seventeenth time in Beijing. Every time he comes to Beijing, he always gains inspiration and strength from the cordial teachings of the Party and state leaders. He enthusiastically responds to and goes all out to fulfill every call issued by the Party. Meng Tai embodies the glorious qualities of the Chinese working class.

Today, what people face is an infinitely beautiful and splendid future: the socialist edifice under construction has laid a solid foundation, and is extending to the clear sky section by section. Therefore, at this time, the heroes cannot help but think about themselves, and how to master time and fly to the garden full of flowers at the fastest speed. Going one step further on the hundred-foot pole is the will of the heroes. In the delegation from Heilongjiang Province, people were surprised to notice a young girl: whether before meals, or on the bus between the dormitory and the meeting place, she always flicked her right fingers quickly, repeating the same action countless times, while constantly shaking her left wrist, as if she was constantly throwing something out, her eyes quietly looking at one place, as if she was thinking about something.... "Why are you always flicking and shaking like this every day?" Someone asked. The girl smiled and said, "Practicing! Hand gestures are not flexible if you don't practice. Five minutes of practice before each meal, and you can practice fifteen minutes a day." So, who is she? She is Li Rong, the eighteen-year-old who created the national record of sorting 10,588 letters per hour. Now, she is determined to reach a higher target: sorting three letters accurately per second. This means that she will sort 10,800 letters in an hour, so she is flicking, shaking, and thinking, and she is willing to dedicate more energy and wisdom to the glorious present and bright future of the motherland in an ordinary position.

The heroes came to the meeting with this desire and enthusiasm to climb higher step by step. People eagerly learned from experience. These days, Beijing has become a city for exchanging experiences, a city for learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced, a city for helping each other and launching revolutionary competitions, and a city for swearing an oath to march towards the completion of new tasks. In the hundreds of meeting rooms in dozens of buildings, people from various systems, industries, and trades are exchanging experiences. There are lectures, questions, diagrams, and performances in the meeting places. Many peers met each other, and every technical discussion was not too deep, and every experience was not too detailed in its transmission. Thousands of experiences were exchanged here, thousands of technical problems were solved here, and hundreds and thousands of people obtained "treasures" and found "scripture." What the heroes learned here was not only technical experience, but also absorbed endless strength: the perseverance of conscious creation, the communist style, the spirit of courage, the quality of not being satisfied with existing achievements, and the courage to always strive for the upstream.

Fourteen days is short for heroes who are eager to learn more experience; however, when they face the glorious tasks of the future, they also think about going back and taking action soon. In order to make our cause move forward quickly and continuously, everyone immediately transmitted the spirit of the Party's instructions and the new experiences they had learned to the whole country from Beijing through telegrams, telephones, and letters. This connected the Beijing conference with hundreds of thousands of enterprises across the country, and tens of millions of employees in enterprises across the country shared the same pulse and breathed the same air as the heroes in Beijing. From inside to outside the conference, from individuals to collectives, from Beijing to the whole country, a powerful collective was formed, forming a broad front - a front for continued leap forward. Comrade Sun Qing is a representative of the advanced collective of more than 4,000 people from the Wangfeng Coal Mine in Henan who came to Beijing to attend the conference. After he conveyed the spirit of the conference and the relevant experience back to the factory by telephone, all the miners had a heated discussion and answered the encouragement given to them by the conference with a grand action: determined to complete this year's raw coal production task one and a half months ahead of schedule; guarantee that next year's raw coal production target will be doubled - from 1.72 million tons to 3.5 million tons. Telegrams of victory flew to Beijing from all over the country like snowflakes. By November 5, the conference had received 8,500 telegrams, which is 8,500 victories. All the employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the steel capital, completed the production task of steel products for October three days ahead of schedule, presenting a gift to the conference. All the employees of the Chengdu Electric Motor Factory in Sichuan reported to the conference that they had completed 202% of the October plan. They said: "The heroes' conference is like being held in our factory, which has boosted the enthusiasm of all the employees!"

The news of victory from all over the country and the soaring enthusiasm of the employees further inspired the heroes attending the conference. Everyone felt that their burden was heavier and that they should move forward more quickly to answer the Party's teachings and respond to the expectations of the employees. Dai Bingyuan, a technician from the Guangzhou Ramie Textile Factory, set a plan for himself: to carry out technical innovation in a big way, to make a stretching machine to increase efficiency by about five times, to make a cutting and combing machine within a month to increase efficiency by four to five times, and to achieve both high yield and high quality. Huang Rongchang, a technical innovation expert and deputy director of the converter steelmaking plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, proposed to challenge all brother factories, planning to immediately start transforming several production tools to ensure that 25,000 labor forces are saved every year and 6,000 tons of steel are produced every month. Hou Zhengyuan, a tractor driver from Xinjiang, challenged tractor drivers across the country with three conditions: to increase the annual plowing area per standard tractor from the quota of 12,000 mu to 60,000 mu, to reduce the oil consumption per mu from the quota of 0.7 kg to 0.3 kg, and to reduce the cost per mu of land from the quota of 0.9 yuan to 0.4 yuan. Everyone has such a plan and such a determination.

When the heroes accepted new glorious tasks from the Party, when they swore to work hard to realize this task, when hundreds of millions of employees enthusiastically responded to the call of the conference and prepared to work together to move forward, we saw this powerful force - the mass movement that is in full swing. The mass movement under the leadership of the Party is the guarantee for our country to achieve victory one after another. In the days of war, we relied on it to defeat the enemy and build a new China. In the days of construction, we relied on it to make the motherland present a prosperous scene everywhere. In the days of the Great Leap Forward, we relied on it to achieve a high speed of construction. Today, the motherland is moving forward on the road of continued leap forward. At this moment, we see a mass movement with a broader scale, more vigorous fighting spirit, and more magnificent momentum. This will be a movement of high-speed construction, a movement full of the wisdom of creation and invention, and a movement in which the communist spirit of competition, mutual assistance, and cooperation is greatly promoted. With the strong leadership of the Party and such a mass movement, we can be invincible.

The sound of the Internationale resounded in the solemn and magnificent Great Hall of the People. What a familiar sound! The Chinese working class spent the years of suffering in this song, grew and strengthened the ranks, pushed the backward China onto the track of prosperity and strength, and will move towards a more brilliant and victorious tomorrow in this song. Six thousand arms rose up like a forest in the song, swearing to the Party and Chairman Mao to guarantee the completion of the tasks entrusted by the Party. From the heroes' powerful arms, joyful faces, and joyful eyes, a strong belief burst out, as they themselves said: listening to the Party and following Chairman Mao will surely lead to victory! This is the ironclad oath of the Chinese working class.

The song of the leap forward is still echoing on the land of the motherland, the red flag of the leap forward is still shining a red light in the sky over the mountains and rivers of the motherland, and the vigorous and earth-shaking movement of increasing production and practicing economy that has been set off after anti-rightist tendencies and boosting morale is unfolding like a rising tide.... Hundreds of millions of people who are leaping forward have extended a welcoming hand to the heroes. Heroes! Let the advanced ideas, advanced technologies, and advanced working methods you have created and learned blossom into bright flowers on the land of the motherland and on the bodies of the hundreds of millions of people you are connected to! Heroes, in the past you were the locomotives of the Great Leap Forward of the motherland, you must drive this locomotive faster and faster along the road guided by the Party, crush all obstacles on the road and drive forward! Heroes, advance at high speed!

    听党的话，跟毛主席走
    本报记者
    六千多名社会主义建设的旗手们，在一起度过了十四天欢乐的聚会。多么不平凡的十四天啊！描不尽我们时代英雄的业迹，叙不完我们人民的伟大抱负；党中央祝贺他们，刘少奇主席接见了他们，周恩来总理欢宴他们。英雄们听了党和领袖们的教导。各路的英雄们汇合了，千万个先进经验汇合了，建设社会主义的意志和力量汇合了！这是个检阅的大会，这是个动员的大会，这是个誓师的大会。
    现在，英雄们将高擎高速度建设社会主义的火炬，沿着党所指引的胜利道路，团结、带领千百万人民，去迎接今年继续跃进的胜利，准备迎接明年继续跃进的胜利！
    党中央向英雄们发出了伟大的战斗号召：团结群众提前和超额完成今年的国民经济计划，在这个基础上迎接明年继续跃进的胜利；让我们在十年左右的时间内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国，让我们提前实现十二年农业发展纲要迅速地把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。党的号召激动着英雄们的心。“把红旗插上新的更大胜利的目标上去！”六千多个英雄在这样一个战斗的渴望下度过了十四天。来自钢都鞍山的六十二岁的老英雄孟泰对人说：“我们要机械化、自动化、电气化、总得有钢，才能把国家建设好啊！工业需要它，农业需要它，处处需要它……。用什么办法多出钢铁、出好钢铁呢，这就是我日夜所想的！”老英雄孟泰给别人说。在会上他向全国大中型高炉冠军本溪钢铁厂的公司第一炼铁厂的党委书记彭石华发出了竞赛挑战书，决心把他们连续保持十九个月的冠军红旗夺过来。
    孟泰的话语和行动里，满是信心，满是力量，满是喜悦。十年来，他伴随着祖国第一个钢铁基地从恢复到成长壮大，献出了全部智慧和力量。他是与祖国钢铁工业同命运、共呼吸的人，他是与祖国伟大的社会主义事业风雨同舟的人。为了钢铁工业的高速度前进，他曾亲自去本溪学习先进经验，又风尘仆仆地远到大青山下，向包钢职工传授自己的经验。孟泰胸前成排的奖章，就是他用全部精力奋勇顽强地把祖国的钢铁工业推向前进，把党的事业推向前进的见证。他已经是第十七次来到北京了。他每次来京，总是从党和国家领导人的亲切教导中获得启示、获得力量。党每次发出的号召，他都热烈响应，全力以赴。孟泰的身上，焕发出中国工人阶级光辉的品质。
    今天，人们面对着的是无限美丽的锦绣前程：正在建设中的社会主义大厦，已奠定坚如磐石的基础，而且节节伸向晴空了。所以这时，英雄们不能不想到自己，不能不想到自己怎样去驾驭时间，用最快的速度，飞向花团紧簇的园地。百尺竿头更进一步，这就是英雄们的意志。在黑龙江省的代表团里，人们惊奇地注视一位年轻的姑娘：她无论在吃饭前，或是在往返宿舍与会场间的汽车上，总是飞快地弹动着右手的指头，无数遍重复同一个动作，同时连连地甩动着左手腕，像是不停地扔出什么东西似的，眼睛静静地看着一个地方，似乎在想什么心事……。“你干吗每天老是这么甩着、弹着的？”有人问。姑娘笑了，说道：“练习呗！手势不练不灵活。每顿饭前练五分钟，一天就能练十五分钟呢。”那末，她是谁呢？她就是创造了每小时拣信一万零五百八十八件全国最高纪录的十八岁的李荣。现在，她决心要达到一个更高的指标：每秒钟准确地分拣三封信。这就是说，她将要在一个小时里分拣信一万零八百件，所以她才在弹着、甩着、想着，她愿意在一个平凡的岗位上，为祖国光辉的现在和灿烂的未来，献出更多的精力和智慧。
    英雄们就是带着这种步步登高的愿望和热情开会的。人们如饥如渴地去学习经验。这几天来，北京，成了交流经验的城，成了学先进、比先进、赶先进、超先进的城，成了相互帮助掀起革命竞赛的城，成了为完成新的任务而誓师进军的城。在几十座大楼的几百个会议室里面，各个系统、各个产业、各个工种的人在交流经验。会场上有讲有问、有图解、有表演。许多个同行相遇了，每一个技术的探讨不厌其深，每一项经验的传播不厌其详。千万个经验在这里交流了，千万个技术难题在这里解决了，千百个人取到了“宝”，找到了“经”。英雄在这里学到的不仅仅是技术上的经验，而是吸取了无穷的力量：自觉创造的毅力、共产主义的风格、勇往直前的精神、不满足已有成就的品质、永远力争上游的胆略。
    十四天，对于渴望学到更多经验的英雄来说是短的；然而，当他们面对着未来光辉的任务，又想着很快回去行动起来。为了让我们的事业不停地飞快地前进，每一个人听到党的指示、学到了新的经验之后，马上通过电报、电话、写信，从北京传向全国。使北京的大会，和全国的几十万个企业联在一起，全国的企业里的几千万职工，和在北京的英雄们同脉搏、共呼吸。由会内到会外、个人到集体、由北京到全国，结成了一个强大的集体，组成了广阔的阵线——继续跃进的阵线。孙卿同志，是代表河南王封煤矿四千多人的先进集体到北京来开会的。当他通过电话，把大会的精神和有关的经验传回厂里去以后。全矿工人热烈地进行讨论，用一个宏伟的行动回答了大会给予他们的鼓励：决心提前一个半月完成今年原煤生产任务；保证明年使原煤生产指标加一番——从一百七十二万吨提高到三百五十万吨。报捷的电报像雪片一样从全国各地飞向北京。到11月5日，大会就收到了八千五百封，这就是八千五百个胜利。钢都鞍山的全体职工，提前三天完成了10月份的钢材生产任务，向大会献礼。四川成都电机厂的全体职工向大会报告，他们已完成10月份计划202％，他们说：“群英大会就像在我们厂子里开的一样，把全厂职工的干劲都鼓起来了！”
    来自全国的胜利消息、职工们的冲天干劲，更鼓舞了到会的英雄。每个人都觉得自己的担子更重了，自己更应该大步前进，来回答党的教导，回答职工们的期待。广州苎麻纺织厂技师戴炳元，给自己订出的计划是：回去大搞技术革新，要制成延展机提高效率五倍左右，月内制成切梳机，提高效率四至五倍，并且做到既高产，又优质。技术革新能手重庆钢铁公司转炉炼钢厂副厂长黄荣昌，提出向所有兄弟厂挑战，自己计划马上着手改造几种生产工具，保证每年节省劳动力二万五千个、每月增产钢六千吨。新疆拖拉机手侯正元，以三项条件向全国拖拉机手挑战：每标准台拖拉机每年翻地由定额的一万二千亩提高到六万亩、每亩耗油量由定额的零点七公斤降低到零点三公斤、每亩地的成本由定额的九角降低到四角。每一个人，都有这样的计划，都有这样的决心。
    当英雄们从党那里接受了新的光荣任务的时候，当他们宣誓努力实现这一任务的时候，当千百万职工热烈响应大会号召，准备齐心协力向前的时候，我们看了这支强大的力量——方兴未艾的群众运动。党所领导下的群众运动，是我们国家节节取得胜利的保证。在战火纷飞的日子里，我们依靠它，战胜了敌人，建设了新中国。在建设的日子里，我们依靠它，使祖国到处呈现一片繁荣的景象。在大跃进的日子里，我们依靠它，取得了建设的高速度。今天，祖国正在继续跃进的道路上走着。就在这时，我们看到了一个规模更为广阔、斗志更为风发、声势更为浩大的群众运动。这又将是个高速度建设的运动，是个充满创造发明的智慧的运动，是个有赛有帮、互助协作的共产主义思想大发扬的运动。有了党的坚强的领导，有了这样的群众运动，我们就可以无往不胜。
    庄严、宏伟的人民大会堂里，响起了国际歌的声音。多么熟悉的声音啊！中国工人阶级，在这歌声中度过了苦难的年代，成长和壮大了队伍，把落后的中国推上奔往繁荣、富强的轨道，并将在这歌声中走向更灿烂的胜利的明天。六千双手臂，在歌声中森林般地竖起，向党、向毛主席宣誓保证完成党交给的任务。从英雄们有力的手臂上、欢乐的面孔上、喜悦的目光中，迸发出坚强的信念，如他们自己所说的：听党的话、跟着毛主席走，就一定能够胜利！这是我国工人阶级金石般的誓言。
    跃进的歌声还在祖国大地上回旋，跃进的红旗依然在祖国山河上空闪耀出一派红光，经过反右倾、鼓干劲已经掀起的轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动正在风起云涌地展开……。千百万正在跃进着的人民，已向英雄们伸出欢迎的手。英雄们！让你们创造的和学习到的先进思想、先进技术、先进工作方法，在祖国的大地上，在你们联系着的千百万人的身上开出鲜艳的花吧！英雄们，过去你们是祖国大跃进的火车头，你们要把这个火车头沿着党所指引的道路，开得更快、更快，碾碎路上的各种障碍向前驶去！英雄们，高速度前进！
