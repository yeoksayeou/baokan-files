"Poor Methods" Have Unlimited Potential
    Many places are now vigorously developing the pig-raising industry. To raise pigs on a large scale, we will inevitably encounter some difficulties: What if there is not enough feed? Where do the piglets come from? How do we solve the problem of pigsties? ... These are all practical problems that we may encounter and must solve. If these problems are not solved well, pigs cannot be developed on a large scale. How do we solve these problems? The experience of the Tanqiao Production Team in developing pig raising, published in this newspaper today, answers these questions.

    The Tanqiao Production Team used "poor methods" to raise pigs and achieved results that were more, faster, better, and more economical: In the first ten months of this year, they raised more than 4,000 pigs, an increase of nearly double compared to last year; there were many pigs and a lot of fertilizer. They could not use it all themselves, and they could supply the Tangnan Production Team with 200 loads of pig manure every day; they sold more than 1,300 head of meat pigs to the state in ten months and supported other places with 600 piglets; the income from pig raising was more than 90,000 yuan, accounting for 43.6% of the total income from agricultural and sideline occupations. This is so exciting!

    What are "poor methods"? "Poor methods" are the most economical methods, the methods that best suit one's own conditions, and the most practical methods, and therefore the best methods. From the "poor methods" of the Tanqiao Production Team, we can see the following characteristics:

    First, adapt to local conditions. The Tanqiao Production Team is in the suburbs of Shanghai. In the past, they took full advantage of the favorable conditions of collecting feed from the city to develop the pig-raising industry. Later, the city's institutions and enterprises also raised pigs on a large scale and did not supply them with feed. What to do? They carefully studied the characteristics of the suburban areas of the city. On the one hand, they continued to organize special personnel to collect rotten melons, fruits, and vegetables in the city; on the other hand, they cut green grass in the wild, planted water hyacinths in small rivers, and planted feed on the edges of the fields, and finally solved the contradiction of insufficient feed. This method is worth emulating in other places. Whether it is in the south or the north, in the plains or in the mountains, each place has its own characteristics. As long as we adapt to local conditions and are good at making full use of the local positive factors to overcome unfavorable factors, we can solve the difficulties in pig production.

    Second, be simple and crude. The so-called being simple and crude means to give full play to the role of existing material conditions, which is to do more with less money. The Tanqiao Production Team has also set an example for us in this regard. With the large-scale development of pigs, there were not enough pigsties. What to do? Should we ask the state for bricks, stones, and wood to build large pigsties? Or should we find ways to be simple and crude? They adopted the latter method. They renovated and expanded a batch of old pigsties, for example, removing the partitions of the small pigsties and turning them into unified pigsties, which doubled the capacity without spending a penny; at the same time, they used old bricks and old materials to build more than 30 earth pigsties. Therefore, the problem of pigsties was also smoothly solved.

    Third, have sufficient drive and not be afraid of difficulties. The Tanqiao Production Team did not have any particularly superior conditions for developing the pig-raising industry. The methods they adopted to solve the feed problem - planting, picking up, collecting, digging, etc. - were not new either. Why were they not only able to solve the feed problem and make the pigs grow exponentially, but also make the weaned piglets grow to 140 catties in just ten months? Of course, it is because they have a set of practical methods, but more importantly, they have a spirit of overcoming difficulties: Is there not enough refined feed? Use green feed instead. Is there not enough fine feed? Use coarse feed instead. If others do well, do you do poorly? If others do complete jobs, do you do incomplete jobs? They used everything that could be used as feed, even if it was scattered and insignificant, which made the source of feed very broad. Other difficulties they encountered were also solved in this spirit!

    Fourth, fully mobilize the masses. The spirit of the Tanqiao Production Team, which is full of drive and not afraid of difficulties, as well as this whole set of practical and effective "poor methods," were all figured out and made by the broad masses. If the masses are not mobilized, even if a few people rack their brains, the problem cannot be solved. Take thinking of ways to adapt to local conditions, for example, how can we adapt to local conditions? This first requires familiarity with the "land," familiarity with the entire natural environment of the unit; second, it requires ways to use favorable conditions to make nature better serve ourselves. Only by fully mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses can we more deeply understand the environment, transform the environment, and more fully use the favorable conditions to benefit us. Nature is an inexhaustible treasure trove, and the masses are the source of wisdom and strength. As long as we are good at relying on the masses, we can find ways to overcome difficulties from them and get the wealth we need from nature.

    These are the characteristics of the "poor methods" of the Tanqiao Production Team.

    Poor methods are infinitely powerful. As long as we, like the comrades of the Tanqiao Production Team, think out and find a set of "poor methods" that are suitable for our own needs, we can also achieve great results.

### “穷办法”潜力无穷

    “穷办法”潜力无穷
    现在许多地方都在大力发展养猪事业。要大量养猪，当然会遇到一些困难：饲料不足怎么办？猪苗哪里来？猪棚如何解决？……这些都是可能遇到又必须解决的实际问题，解决不好，猪就不能大量发展。怎样解决这些问题呢？本报今天发表的谈桥生产队发展养猪的经验回答了这些问题。
    谈桥生产队用“穷办法”养猪，收到了多快好省的效果：今年头十个月养猪四千多头，比去年增长近一倍；猪多、肥也多，自己用不完，每天还可以供给塘南生产队二百担猪粪；十个月卖给国家肉猪一千三百多头，支援别处猪苗六百头；养猪收入九万多元，占农副业总收入的43.6％。这是多么令人兴奋的事情！
    什么是“穷办法”？“穷办法”就是最经济的办法，最切合自己条件的办法，最实际的办法，因而也就是最好的办法。从谈桥生产队的“穷办法”中，我们可以看出以下几个特色：
    第一是因地制宜。谈桥生产队在上海郊区，过去他们充分利用向城市搜集饲料的有利条件，发展了养猪事业。后来城市的机关、企业也大量养猪，不供给他们饲料了。怎么办？他们认真地研究了城市郊区的特点，一方面继续组织专人到市区搜集烂的瓜果、蔬菜；另方面又到野外割青草，在小河浜种水浮莲，在地边种饲料，终于解决了饲料不足的矛盾。这种办法，值得其它地方仿效。不论南方和北方，平原和山区，各地都有自己的特点，只要因地制宜，善于充分利用当地的积极因素，克服不利因素，就能解决养猪生产中的困难。
    第二是因陋就简。所谓因陋就简，就是要充分发挥现有物质条件的作用，就是要少花钱多办事。谈桥生产队在这方面也为我们做出了榜样。猪大量发展了，猪棚不够。怎么办？是向国家要砖石、木料，大建猪棚？还是因陋就简地想办法？他们采取了后一个办法。改建扩建一批旧猪棚，例如把小棚的隔板拆掉，变成统棚，容量扩大一倍，不用花一个钱；同时利用旧砖旧料盖了三十多间土棚。因此，猪棚问题也顺利地解决了。
    第三是干劲足、不怕困难。谈桥生产队发展养猪业，并没有什么特别优越的条件，他们所采用的解决饲料的办法——种、拾、采、挖等也不新奇，为什么他们不仅能够解决了饲料问题，使猪成倍地增长起来，而且只用十个月就使隔奶小猪长到一百四十斤？固然因为他们有一套切实的办法，更重要的是他们有这样一种克服困难的精神：精饲料不够么？用青饲料代。细饲料不够么？用粗饲料代。别人搞好的么？自己搞差的。别人搞整的么？自己搞零的。他们把一切可以利用作饲料的东西都利用起来了，那怕是零零星星、点点滴滴，这就使饲料的来源十分广阔。他们所遇到的其他困难，也都是本着这种精神解决了！
    第四是充分发动群众。谈桥生产队干劲足，不怕困难的精神，以及这一整套切实有效的“穷办法”，都是依靠广大群众想出来，作出来的。如果不把群众发动起来，任凭少数人挖空心思，也不能解决问题。就拿因地制宜想办法来说吧，怎样才能做到因地制宜呢？这首先需要熟悉“地”，熟悉本单位的全部自然环境；其次，需要有办法利用有利条件，使大自然更好地为自己服务。这只有充分发动群众，依靠群众，才能更深刻地认识环境、改造环境，更充分地利用有利条件为我们造福。大自然是取之不尽用之不竭的宝库，群众是智慧和力量的源泉，只要我们善于依靠群众，我们就能从他那里找到克服困难的办法，向大自然拿到我们所需要的财富。
    这就是谈桥生产队的“穷办法”的特色。
    穷办法威力无穷，只要像谈桥生产队的同志们那样，想出和找到一套适合自己需要的“穷办法”，同样会干出巨大的成绩来。
