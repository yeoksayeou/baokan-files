Xinhua News Agency, 5th — The Beijing football team defeated the Swedish football champion, the Swedish "Djurgårdens" Sports Club football team, by a score of 1-0 today at the Xianongtan Stadium in Beijing. Beijing's winning goal was scored by left winger Wang Lu with a powerful shot into the net half an hour into the first half. At that time, Beijing's right winger Cong Zheyu received the ball to the right of the visiting team's goal. "Djurgårdens" goalkeeper Peterson immediately ran to the right to block the shooting line. Seeing that a shot was not possible, Chen Jialiang immediately passed a long ball to the left of the visiting team's goal. At this moment, Wang Lu quickly caught up. He waited for the bouncing ball just as it sprang up off the ground, delivering a slanting shot that Peterson was unable to save.

After the friendly match, Vice Premier of the State Council He Long met with the athletes from both sides on the field and took pictures with them.

    北京队胜瑞典“尤哥登”队
    据新华社5日讯　北京足球队今天在北京先农坛体育场以一比○战胜了瑞典足球冠军——瑞典“尤哥登”体育俱乐部足球队。北京队获胜的这一球，是上半场比赛进行了半个钟头时，由左边锋王陆劲射入网的。当时，北京队右边锋从者余在客队球门右方得到球，“尤哥登”队守门员彼德森立刻跑到右方挡住射门路线，陈家亮见射门不成，马上长传球到客队球门左方，这时王陆迅速赶上，他等落地的球刚弹起的当儿一脚斜射，使彼德森扑救不及。
    友谊比赛结束以后，国务院副总理贺龙到球场上接见了双方的运动员，并且同他们在一起照了像。
