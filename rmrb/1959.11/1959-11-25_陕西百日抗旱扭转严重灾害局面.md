Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, November 24th:

    The people of Shaanxi Province, after a hundred days of struggle, have achieved a great victory in the fight against drought. Preliminary threshing results from various regions indicate that despite the severe drought and a reduction in sown area compared to last year, the total autumn grain output of the province is still close to the level of last year's Great Leap Forward.

    This year, Shaanxi Province suffered from a severe drought, rarely seen in nearly thirty years, with the severity of the drought in some areas unprecedented in nearly a century. The drought was widespread and prolonged. Drought symptoms began to appear in late June and did not fully subside until mid-September, lasting for more than three months. The drought-affected areas included 365 people's communes in 30 counties and cities (accounting for more than half of the total number of people's communes in the province). A total of 20,068,000 mu of autumn grain crops and cotton fields were affected by the drought, accounting for 53.4% of the total area of autumn grain and cotton fields, including 4,360,000 mu of cotton fields, accounting for 94.8% of the total cotton field area. The Guanzhong region and the Hanzhong and Ankang special districts in the Han River basin, which were severely affected by the drought, are also high-yield areas for autumn grain and cotton in the province. This situation posed a serious threat to Shaanxi's agricultural production this year. However, under the leadership of the Party and relying on the power of the people's communes, the people of the province fought a hundred-day war against the drought, finally overcoming the disaster and realizing the slogan put forward by the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China: "Turning serious disasters into minor disasters, minor disasters into no disasters, and striving for overproduction in the absence of disasters."

    The drought resistance struggle in the severely affected Ankang special district can represent the situation in various severely affected areas. From early June to the end of August, there was no significant rainfall in the district. 80% of the ponds in the district dried up, and most small rivers stopped flowing. Out of 4,530,000 mu of autumn fields, 3,000,000 mu were affected by the drought, of which 2,600,000 mu were severely affected, and 300,000 mu of crops were completely dried up. However, under the leadership of the Party, the people's communes throughout the district mobilized 430,000 laborers to fight the drought with all their strength. People searched for water sources in the mountains and valleys, finding more than 4,300 locations. Communes and their internal units organized large-scale cooperation, building more than 20,000 ponds and 27,000 canals. A large number of waterwheels and powered pumping machinery were newly installed, and more than 50,000 large and small water-carrying tools were used to rush irrigation, ensuring that more than 800,000 mu of autumn fields were irrigated. In addition, water was carried to irrigate more than 800,000 mu. They also planted 830,000 mu of late autumn grain crops and vegetables while fighting the drought. As a result, the irrigated rice in the district achieved a bumper harvest, with an average yield per mu increasing by about 10% compared to last year. Although the total grain output of the district for the year was more than 40% lower than last year due to the severe drought and a reduction in sown area, it was still higher than the average year since liberation.

    In the Guanzhong area, a severely affected area, most of the cotton suffered from drought and insect pests. In addition, the total cotton output this year was lower than last year due to the reduction in sown area compared to last year. However, thanks to the focus on drought resistance and field management, the yield per mu was still close to last year's level. Sanyuan County, where the cotton field area accounts for more than 15% of the total cotton field area in the province, organized large-scale cooperation among people's communes, rushing to build water conservancy projects and implementing rational water use, ensuring the irrigation of drought-affected cotton fields. As a result, the average cotton yield per mu increased by more than 20% compared to last year. With a slight reduction in sown area, the total output still increased by 18.5% compared to last year, the highest annual output since liberation.

    Lightly affected areas generally did not reduce production compared to last year, and some even increased production. The Shangluo special district had the largest increase in production. Of the 2,580,000 mu of autumn fields in the district, 670,000 mu were affected by the drought, of which more than 23,000 mu yielded no harvest due to the drought. When the drought occurred, the affected people's communes cooperated to rush to build water conservancy projects and rescue drought-affected crops. The people's communes that were not affected by the drought launched a vigorous campaign to exceed contracted production targets, processing and managing autumn fields. As a result, due to the increase in yield per unit area, although the sown area of autumn fields was reduced compared to last year, the total autumn grain output of the district still increased by 18% compared to last year.

    All counties in the Yan'an special district, which were basically not affected by the disaster, and the counties of Tongchuan, Baoji, Longxian, Pucheng, Hancheng, and Qianxian in Guanzhong, which were slightly affected by the drought, had a bumper harvest this year, with both yield per mu and total output increasing compared to last year.

    In the fight against drought, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Party committees at all levels continuously strengthened ideological leadership and adopted various measures to deepen the struggle step by step, moving from one climax to another. As early as the end of June, when the drought symptoms just appeared, the Provincial Party Committee issued a combat call to the people of the province to resist drought and protect the autumn harvest. As the drought expanded and continued, the Provincial Party Committee timely pointed out to the people of the province the favorable conditions for resisting the drought. Responsible comrades at all levels went to the front line to lead the drought resistance struggle, which greatly boosted the morale of the masses and quickly set off a province-wide movement to resist drought and protect the autumn harvest. Later, when implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose right-leaning tendencies and encourage hard work, the Provincial Party Committee thoroughly criticized right-leaning thoughts such as the "fixed situation" theory of autumn fields, and put forward the slogans "Turning serious disasters into minor disasters, minor disasters into no disasters, and striving for overproduction in the absence of disasters" and "More effort, more grain," pushing the drought resistance, autumn protection, and over-contracted production movement to a new climax. The labor force invested in drought resistance in drought-affected areas rapidly increased from the usual 1.5 million to about 2 million, and the average daily irrigated area also increased from 350,000 mu to 500,000 mu, and then to 1 million mu.

    The people's communes played a huge role in resisting drought and protecting the autumn harvest. For example, the Muwang Commune in Zhen'an County planned to build a canal during the agricultural cooperative period to solve the irrigation problem of more than 2,000 mu of dry land. However, due to the small size and weakness of the cooperative, and because it involved several agricultural cooperatives, the contradiction was not easy to resolve and it was not done. This year, under the unified leadership of the commune, after 60 days of hard work, crossing 56 ridges, passing 45 bays, and overcoming 17 steep cliffs, a 70-li long canal was built, irrigating more than 2,500 mu of drought-affected dry land. The Xinzheng Production Team of the Masou Commune in Xingping County drilled its own wells to irrigate its fields, and gave the saved canal water to brother production teams downstream or upstream. 3,000 laborers were drawn from 394 production teams in Yanchang County to support 193 production teams lacking labor, ensuring the timely completion of the task of weeding more.

    In the fight against drought, the industrial, transportation, and commercial departments gave priority to manufacturing, transporting, and supplying drought resistance materials. Cadres, workers, school teachers and students, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and urban residents in various regions also enthusiastically supported the people's communes in rushing irrigation. During the most tense period of drought resistance, the number of cadres, workers, students, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and urban residents who were mobilized to support drought resistance reached more than 840,000 people every day.

    After a hundred days of struggle, not only was the drought overcome, but also many new water conservancy projects were built. During the drought resistance period, the province repaired and newly built 58 reservoirs, more than 35,000 canals, more than 20,000 ponds, drilled more than 25,000 wells, installed more than 7,700 waterwheels, and completed more than 50,000 other small-scale water conservancy projects, improving irrigation conditions and expanding the irrigated area of farmland. While fighting the drought, all parts of the province also used idle land and scattered small plots of land to plant many late autumn crops and autumn vegetables, with buckwheat and autumn vegetables alone covering more than 4,340,000 mu.

    陕西百日抗旱扭转严重灾害局面
    受旱地区包括三十个县、市的三百六十五个人民公社，占全省人民公社总数一半以上；受旱秋粮和棉田共达二千多万亩，占秋粮和棉田总面积53.4％。经过抗旱保秋的艰巨斗争，全省秋粮总产量仍然接近去年大跃进的水平。
    新华社西安24日电  陕西省人民经过百日奋战，抗旱斗争获得巨大胜利。从目前各地初步碾打情况看，今年在大旱和播种面积比去年有所减少的情况下，全省秋粮总产量，仍然接近去年大跃进的水平。
    今年陕西省遭受了近三十多年来少见的严重干旱威胁，局部地区的干旱严重情况为近百年来所未有；旱灾范围广而持续时间长。从今年6月下旬开始出现旱象，直到9月中旬旱象才全部解除，干旱时间延续三个多月。受旱地区包括三十个县、市的三百六十五个人民公社（占全省人民公社总数一半以上），受旱秋季粮食作物和棉田共达二千零六十八万亩，占秋粮和棉田总面积53.4％，其中受旱棉田四百三十六万亩，占棉田总面积94.8％。受旱严重的关中地区和汉江流域的汉中、安康两个专区，又是全省秋粮和棉花的高产区。这种情况，对陕西今年的农业生产是个严重威胁。但是，由于全省人民在党的领导下，依靠人民公社的威力，同干旱大战百天，终于战胜了旱灾，实现了中共陕西省委提出的“重灾变轻灾，轻灾变无灾，无灾力争超产”的口号。
    重灾区安康专区的抗旱斗争，可以代表各个重灾区的情况。这个专区从6月初到8月底，没有落过透雨，全区80％的池塘干涸，大部小河断流，在四百五十三万亩秋田中，有三百万亩受旱，其中受重灾的有二百六十万亩，有三十万亩庄稼全部干死。但是全区人民公社在党的领导下，抽出四十三万个劳力全力抗旱，人们翻山越岭找出水源四千三百多处，各个公社以及公社内部又组织大协作，兴修池塘二万多处，渠道二万七千多条，新安了大批水车和动力抽水机械，动用大、小担水工具五万多件，突击抢浇抢灌，保证了八十多万亩秋田得到了灌溉，另外担水点浇八十多万亩，还抗旱抢种晚秋粮食作物和种菜八十三万亩。结果，全区能灌溉的水稻获得大丰收，平均亩产量比去年增加一成左右，全区全年粮食总产量，虽因大旱和播种面积减少而比去年降低四成多，但仍高于解放以来的平年年成。
    重灾区关中地区的棉花，绝大部分遭到了旱灾和虫灾的袭击，再加播种面积比去年减少，今年棉花总产量比去年降低，但因抓紧了抗旱和田间管理，亩产仍然接近去年水平。棉田面积占全省棉田总面积15％以上的三原县，由于各人民公社组织大协作，突击兴修水利和实行合理用水，保证了受旱棉田的灌溉，结果，棉花平均亩产比去年增长二成多，在播种面积有所减少的情况下，总产量仍比去年提高了18.5％，是解放以来年产量最高的一年。
    轻灾区和去年相比一般都不减产甚至增产。增产最多的是商雒专区。这个专区的二百五十八万亩秋田中，有六十七万亩受旱，其中有二万三千多亩因旱无收。旱象发生时，受旱的人民公社就开展协作，突击兴修水利，抢救受旱作物，没有受旱的人民公社，展开了轰轰烈烈的超包产运动，对秋田加工管理。结果，由于单位面积产量提高，秋田播种面积虽比去年减少，全区秋粮总产量仍比去年增加了18％。
    基本上没有受灾的延安专区各县和轻微受旱的关中铜川、宝鸡、陇县、蒲城、韩城、乾县等县，今年全部丰收，亩产量和总产量都比去年增加。
    在抗旱斗争中，中共陕西省委和各级党委不断加强思想领导，采取各项措施，使斗争节节深入，由一个高潮走向另一个新的高潮。早在6月底，旱象刚露头，省委就向全省人民发出抗旱保秋的战斗号召，随着旱象的扩大和延续，省委又及时向全省人民指出了抗旱的有利条件，各级负责同志都亲临前线，领导抗旱斗争，这样，大大鼓舞了群众的斗志，迅速掀起了全民性的抗旱保秋运动。以后，省委又在贯彻党的八届八中全会反右倾、鼓干劲的精神时，彻底批判了秋田“定局”论等右倾思想，提出“重灾变轻灾，轻灾变无灾，无灾力争超产”、“多鼓一分干劲、多增加一分粮食”的口号，把抗旱保秋和超包产运动又推向了新的高潮。受旱地区投入抗旱的劳力迅速由经常的一百五十多万人，逐渐增加到二百万人左右，平均每日灌溉面积也由三十五万亩增加到五十万亩，又增加到一百万亩。
    人民公社在抗旱保秋中发挥了巨大威力。例如镇安县木王公社，在农业社时期，就打算修一条水渠，解决二千多亩旱地的灌溉问题，但因社小力弱，又因涉及几个农业社，矛盾不易解决，没有办到。今年在公社统一领导下，大战六十天，翻过五十六条墚，过了四十五道湾，越过十七个陡崖，修了一条长达七十华里的水渠，灌溉了二千五百多亩受旱的旱地。兴平县马蒐公社新政生产队自己打井灌田，把节约下的渠水让给下游或原上兄弟生产队使用。延长县三百九十四个生产队抽出劳力三千多个，支援缺乏劳力的一百九十三个生产队，保证及时完成了多锄草的任务。
    在抗旱中，工业、交通运输和商业部门，都尽先制造、运输和供应抗旱物资。各地干部、工人、学校师生、解放军官兵和城市居民，也热烈支援人民公社抢浇抢灌。在抗旱最紧张的时期，全省每天出动支援抗旱的干部、工人、学生、解放军官兵和城市居民等即达八十四万多人。
    经过百日奋战，不仅战胜了干旱，还新修了许多水利工程。在抗旱期间，全省共整修与新建水库五十八座、渠道三万五千多条、池塘二万多口，打井二万五千多眼，安装水车七千七百多部，还完成了其他小型水利工程五万多处，改善了灌溉条件，扩大了农田灌溉面积。全省各地还在抗旱的同时，利用休闲地、零星小块土地，播种了很多晚秋作物和秋菜，仅荞麦和秋菜就种了四百三十多万亩。
