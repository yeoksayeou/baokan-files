　　Certainly Able to Catch Up with the Advanced
　　Salesperson, First Textile Products Store, Xining, Qinghai　　Zhang Shuluan

　　During those extraordinary days attending the Congress of Heroes, I was always thinking about what more I should do for the Party. These past few days, I’ve been taking time to write something – “The Art of Serving Customers.” I plan to summarize my experiences and lessons as a salesperson, sharing them unreservedly with my colleagues. This can’t help but make me recall the winding but meaningful road I’ve traveled.

　　In 1956, I was still a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl who had attended elementary school for two years. Filled with enthusiasm, I responded to the Party's call to support the frontier regions. Unexpectedly, I was later assigned to be a salesperson. At that time, I saw being a salesperson as demeaning, so I was restless at work. Customers wanted one thing, and I'd grab another, often making mistakes. I also didn't humbly listen to customers' opinions and comrades' criticisms. My work was sluggish; I was truly backward!

　　How did I, once a backward salesperson, become an advanced salesperson?

　　When I lacked an understanding of the significance of commercial work and was unsettled in my job, I emphasized that my low education prevented me from doing the work well, and I couldn't learn from advanced workers. When I started to change but wasn't fully settled, I didn't pay attention to learning advanced work methods from others. Consequently, for a period, although I was enthusiastic with customers, the results were still poor. Customers wrote in the suggestion book: "Salesperson No. 709 has a warm service attitude, but it makes us feel very embarrassed."

　　It wasn't until I truly listened to the Party's words, recognized the importance of socialist commercial work, and resolved to catch up with the advanced, believing that what others could do, I could also do. From then on, I used all my spare time to intensify the study of advanced experiences, often staying up all night repeatedly studying the "Tianqiao" service pledge, learning the advanced experiences of salespeople in Heilongjiang… Finally, I overcame various difficulties, understood customer psychology, and learned methods such as taking measurements for clothing, thus constantly receiving praise from customers. They praised me, saying, "You really see through my heart!"

　　Of course, what I have done is still far from enough; however, the existing facts have already given me profound inspiration: the backward have the possibility of catching up with the advanced. The key to transformation lies in whether one can sincerely and resolutely listen to the Party's words, truly implement putting politics in command, and treat the specific work the Party has entrusted to oneself as a noble cause. Add to that high aspirations and a willingness to learn, and temporary backwardness will quickly change.

    一定能赶上先进
    青海西宁第一纺织品门市部售货员　　张淑鸾
    出席群英会的那些不平常的日子里，我总想着应当为党再作些什么。这几天，我抽空在写一篇东西——“接待顾客的艺术”。我打算总结一下当售货员的经验教训，毫无保留地介绍给我的同行。于是，不由得回忆起我所走过的一段曲折而有意义的道路。
    1956年，我还是一个上了两年小学的十六七岁的姑娘。我怀着满腔热情，响应党的号召去支援边疆。不料，后来分配我当售货员。那时，我把售货员看成是低三下四的，因此我在工作中心神不定，顾客要这样，我拿那样，常出差错。也不虚心听取顾客的意见和同志们的批评。工作疲疲沓沓，真是落后！
    曾经是一个落后售货员的我又怎样成为一个先进售货员的呢？
    当我对商业工作的意义还缺乏认识，不安心工作的时候，我曾强调文化低干不了，也没法向先进者学习。当我开始有了转变但还没有完全安下心来的时候，也不注意学习别人的先进工作方法。因而，有一段时期，我虽然对顾客热情了，但效果还是不好，顾客在意见簿上写道：“709号售货员服务态度虽热情，但弄的我们很难为情。”
    直到自己真正听了党的话，认识到社会主义商业工作的重要意义，并且立志要赶上先进，认定别人能作的，我也就能作到。从此，我利用一切休息时间，加紧学习先进经验，常常彻夜不眠地反复学习“天桥”的服务公约，学习黑龙江售货员的先进经验……。终于，克服了种种困难，懂得了顾客心理，学会了量体裁衣等方法，因而不断受到顾客的赞扬。他们称赞说：“你真看透了我的心！”
    当然，我做得还很不够；但是，现有的事实已经给了我深刻的启发：落后的是有赶上先进的可能性的，转变的关键在于能不能真心地坚决地听党的话，真正作到政治挂帅，把党交给自己的具体工作当作崇高的事业。再加上长志气肯学习，一时的落后是会很快改变的。
