Xinhua News Agency, November 6th: Comrade Li Xiannian, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, addressed the vast number of commune members and cadres of the people's communes, production brigades, and production teams, as well as all finance and trade cadres, at the National Broadcast Conference on Agricultural Product Procurement today.

  **Already Achieved Five Victories**

    In his speech, Comrade Li Xiannian first congratulated everyone on the great achievements made on the agricultural front and the finance and trade front. He said that our agricultural front and finance and trade front, like other fronts, have achieved great successes. We have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and the government, carried out a long-term and arduous struggle against natural disasters and to protect seedlings, launched a magnificent movement to protect and increase production, and then invested in the massive agricultural product procurement movement, achieving remarkable results and brilliant victories. Summarizing the achievements of agricultural product procurement, there are mainly five aspects of victory. First, the harvesting work has been done well, achieving a bumper harvest on the basis of agricultural abundance, realizing the Party and government's requirement of "abundance and bumper harvest." Second, this year's agricultural product procurement movement has developed rapidly, with great momentum and concentrated time, about a month earlier than last year, and the procurement volume of many major agricultural products has greatly increased compared with the same period last year. From a regional perspective, since the summer grain harvest this year, eight provinces and regions, including Guizhou, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, Henan, and Guangxi, have completed the annual grain purchase tasks, and Sichuan Province has completed the annual cotton procurement task. Third, most regions, while focusing on the production and procurement of major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oilseeds, have also vigorously developed diversified operations and launched a "small autumn harvest" movement for wild plant raw materials. Therefore, the procurement volume of by-products and local specialties has also greatly increased. Fourth, a mass upsurge of various vegetables has been launched throughout the country, and the autumn vegetable output in rural areas across the country this year can reach several hundred billion jin. This can greatly increase the supply of vegetables in urban and rural areas and improve the lives of urban residents and farmers. Fifth, many places have launched mass agricultural product processing movements and short-distance transportation movements, ensuring that the procured agricultural products can be processed and transported in a timely manner, ensuring the needs of light industrial raw materials, domestic market supply, and export sources.

    Comrade Li Xiannian then said, why is this year's agricultural product procurement work done better than in the past? Why are the achievements in agricultural product procurement so great? We believe that this is a great victory for the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, a victory for the Party's mass line, the result of the combination of the mass movement of the broad masses of farmers and the mass movement of employees in the finance and trade departments, and a great victory for the people's commune system. Under the unified leadership of the people's commune party committees, it is possible to take into account all aspects of rural work and make overall arrangements; it is possible to fully utilize and reasonably allocate labor, exert greater labor productivity, and ensure the combined operation of harvesting, threshing, selling, processing, and transporting agricultural products. All of this is determined by the leadership of the Party and putting politics in command. Wherever the leadership of the Party is strengthened, the Party's general line can be well implemented, and the agricultural product procurement work can achieve greater victories. Of all things, the leadership of the Party is the most important. This has been done particularly well this year.

    Comrade Li Xiannian said that the general line, the mass movement, the great leap forward, the people's communes, and the leadership of the Party are the fundamental reasons for the continued leap forward in the entire national economy this year and the great achievements made in agricultural product procurement this year. The right-leaning opportunists attacked the general line, the mass movement, the great leap forward, the people's communes, and the leadership of the Party, and now the ironclad facts have completely shattered their attacks.

  **Doing a Good Job in Procurement Achieves Four Benefits**

    Comrade Li Xiannian said that the procurement of agricultural products is a work with significant economic and political significance. Doing a good job in procurement can achieve four benefits in one fell swoop: it can increase industrial raw materials, increase market supply, increase commune accumulation, and increase commune members' income. Grain, cotton, oil, and other agricultural products are the main raw materials for light industry and the basic necessities of life for people's food and clothing. Completing the procurement task is extremely important for the development of industrial production and the prosperity of the market. From the perspective of farmers, people's communes can obtain production funds by selling agricultural products, which can be used to purchase agricultural machinery, new farm tools, fertilizers, pesticides, and other means of production; it can also increase the cash income of commune members and further improve the lives of commune members. The procurement policy of the People's Government is completely consistent with the interests of the broad masses of farmers. Farmers will remember that in the old society before liberation, bureaucratic landlords and speculative merchants used to depress prices in the autumn, buying cheap and selling dear, and cruelly exploiting the farmers. This situation has long gone since the founding of New China. The People's Government procures agricultural products at fair and reasonable prices and supplies farmers with necessities at fair and reasonable prices. In New China, selling agricultural products not only meets the needs of the country, but also meets the requirements of the people's communes and the broad masses of commune members. The interests of the country and the interests of the farmers are consistent. The broad masses of farmers sell agricultural products happily, beating gongs and drums, and that is the reason. It should also be seen that completing the procurement task is not only of great significance to the current national economic development, but also an important condition for the continued leap forward of the national economy next year. We must do this work well.

    Comrade Li Xiannian then said that agricultural products have now been basically harvested, the high tide of agricultural product procurement has been fully formed, and is developing towards a greater high tide, and the agricultural product procurement work has entered a decisive stage. November will be a decisive month for agricultural product procurement to achieve complete victory. We must seize this opportunity, continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, advance on the crest of victory, and complete and over fulfill the task of agricultural product procurement in a timely manner. This is a glorious task currently placed before party committees at all levels, all rural workers, finance and trade workers, and all farmers. We must continue to respond to the call of the Party and the government, and resolutely and in every possible way complete this glorious task.

  **Conscientiously Do Six Tasks Well**

    Comrade Li Xiannian said that why is it required to complete the procurement task quickly and in a timely manner? This is because all tasks are currently continuing to leap forward, and there are many things that should be done in rural areas. For example, large-scale water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation and production, deep plowing of land, and the development of diversified operations must all be grasped tightly. Only by doing a good job in procurement in a relatively short period of time can leaders at all levels and the broad masses of farmers free up their hands to concentrate on various production tasks. This is completely in line with the interests and requirements of the broad masses of farmers. In order to complete and over fulfill the agricultural product procurement task in a timely manner, we must conscientiously do the following six tasks well:

    1.  Continue to Strengthen the Leadership of the Party, Vigorously Publicize the Party's General Line, Adhere to Putting Politics in Command, Launch a Mass Movement on a Large Scale, Correctly Implement Policies, and Rapidly Push the Agricultural Product Procurement Movement to a New and Greater High Tide.

    Party committees at all levels, under the principle of making overall arrangements for various rural tasks, should further strengthen the leadership of agricultural product procurement work, grasp ideology, grasp policies, grasp tasks, grasp measures, and grasp them tightly, well, meticulously, and practically. The most important thing is to strengthen political and ideological leadership, permeate political and ideological work into all stages, all links, and all aspects, so that there is ideological work in every stage, ideological work in every step, and ideological work in every matter.

    Throughout the agricultural product procurement movement, it is necessary to do a good job in the political and ideological work of cadres at all levels, and also to do a good job in the political and ideological work of the broad masses of farmers. First of all, it is necessary to do a good job in the political and ideological work of cadres at all levels. Moreover, in doing a good job in the ideological work of cadres at all levels, doing a good job in the ideological work of production team cadres is a decisive link. This is because production team cadres, on the one hand, accept the state's commission to procure agricultural products, and on the other hand, they are the sellers of agricultural products. The state's agricultural product procurement policy must be conveyed to the broad masses of farmers through production team cadres, and the agricultural product procurement task must be completed by mobilizing the masses through production team cadres.

    To complete the agricultural product procurement task well, it is necessary to mobilize the masses and rely on the masses, and launch a mass movement on a large scale, which must be both vigorous and down-to-earth. How can the masses be fully mobilized? The most fundamental method is to vigorously publicize the Party's general line of socialist construction through recollection, comparison, accounting, and other means, and to continue to carry out socialist education of opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale universally and deeply. Vigorously talk about the high-speed development of national construction, vigorously talk about the superiority of the people's communes, vigorously talk about mutual assistance between urban and rural areas and the worker-peasant alliance, vigorously talk about the state's agricultural product procurement policy, and vigorously talk about the importance of completing and over fulfilling the agricultural product procurement task.

    In the procurement work, it is necessary to correctly implement the policies of the Party and the state, unify policies and tasks, reasonably take into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, and procurement staff should pay attention to investigation and research, verify output, and in accordance with the provisions of policy standards, leave the part that should be left for farmers to use for themselves, and procure the part that should be procured by the state. Farmers should report output truthfully and sell the products that should be sold to the state, which is the glorious task of the farmers.

    2.  Must Focus on Grain, Cotton, Oil, and Pigs to Ensure the Comprehensive and Balanced Development of the Agricultural Product Procurement Movement.

    The current agricultural product procurement movement, in general, is healthy and the development is rapid, but the development between regions and between varieties is not balanced enough. Now that the procurement work has entered a decisive period, we must strengthen leadership and be diligent in inspection on the basis of opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, and resolutely change these imbalances between regions and between varieties, and ensure that the agricultural product procurement movement centered on grain, cotton, oil, and pigs can develop comprehensively and balanced. Whichever region has a problem, vigorously promote that region, whichever variety has a problem, earnestly grasp that variety, and whichever link is weak, practically strengthen that link. It is necessary to establish models, insert red flags, promptly announce achievements, compare with each other, and carry out socialist competition; it is necessary to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, help the backward, grasp both ends, and bring along the middle, help each other, and improve together. County-level organs should establish a daily procurement progress inspection system by variety and by region, and stipulate daily, five-day, and ten-day procurement progress indicators as a specific measure to grasp the movement and strengthen leadership. Leading organs at all levels must send work teams to go deep into the grassroots, investigate and study, conduct on-site inspections, make rounds of inspections, and vigorously promote the development of procurement work.

    3.  Must Do a Good Job from Beginning to End, Without Leaving a Tail, and Resolutely Do a Good Job in the Later Stage of Agricultural Product Procurement.

    Doing a good job in the later stage of agricultural product procurement depends on two fundamental conditions. One condition is that it depends on whether the later stage work can be included in the agenda of the party committee and continue to strive for complete victory. Because the later the stage, the more arduous the work and the greater the policy implications. If the later stage work is not included in the agenda of the party committee and is completely handed over to the business departments, it will not be possible to complete the procurement task well. Another condition is that it depends on whether cadres and the masses continue to boost their morale in the later stage of procurement, and whether the ideological problems of cadres and the masses can be solved well. Because in the later stage of procurement, cadres and the masses often easily develop a relaxed mood. If this relaxed mood is not overcome, the later stage work cannot continue to move forward. All localities must resolutely prevent the phenomenon of being tight in the front and loose in the back, and strive to ensure that agricultural product procurement does not leave a tail. After the autumn and winter procurement tasks are completed and over fulfilled, attention should also be paid to doing a good job in regular procurement work.

    4.  Should, Under the Condition of Implementing National Policies and Under the Principle of Properly Arranging Rural Grain Use, Increase the Commodity Rate of Various Agricultural Products as Much as Possible.

    Doing a good job in agricultural product procurement, completing and over fulfilling the agricultural product procurement task, can better promote the development of the commune economy and the entire national economy, and is of great benefit to the country, the collective, and the individual. Therefore, under the principle of leaving the self-use portion of the commune and commune members according to the standards stipulated by the state, and under the principle of properly arranging farmers' rations, seeds, and feed grain, all localities should be required to increase the commodity rate of agricultural products as much as possible and develop commodity exchange between the state and the communes. When checking the procurement work, all localities should check not only the completion of the task, but also the implementation of the policy, and check the commodity rate of agricultural products.

    5.  Rely on the Masses and Mobilize the Masses to Vigorously Do a Good Job in Various Business Aspects of Agricultural Product Procurement.

    There are now two different approaches to the processing and transportation of agricultural products, and the results obtained are two different results. One approach is that not only should the broad masses of farmers be mobilized and relied upon to sell the agricultural products that should be sold to the state, but also the broad masses of farmers should be mobilized and relied upon to complete the processing and transportation of agricultural products, and the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of people should be fully utilized, and technical innovations should be carried out on a large scale, and both indigenous and foreign methods should be implemented, and all state and commune, mechanical and manual, advanced and backward tools and equipment should be fully utilized. In this way, the agricultural product procurement business work can closely follow the development of the farmers' sales movement. Another approach is to simply rely on the personnel and equipment of the grain and commercial departments to engage in processing and transportation, without mobilizing and relying on the broad masses of farmers, and as a result, the business work always lags behind the development of the movement. We should resolutely adopt the former approach and launch a broad mass movement in all aspects of procurement work.

    6.  While Doing a Good Job in Agricultural Product Procurement, We Must Vigorously Do a Good Job in the Supply of Rural Means of Production and Means of Livelihood.

    We should do everything possible to supply rural areas with means of livelihood and means of production. All industrial products that are suitable for sale in rural areas should be given priority to supply rural areas. Only by conscientiously doing a good job in the supply work in rural areas can the agricultural product procurement work be done better. We should develop mutual assistance between urban and rural areas and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance through organizing the exchange of industrial products and agricultural products. The finance and trade departments must vigorously support agricultural production, promote the mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification of agriculture, and promote the high-speed development of the agricultural economy. This is a major political task.

    Comrade Li Xiannian finally said that the national agricultural product procurement movement is currently at a decisive moment to achieve complete victory, and the opportunity cannot be missed. We call on all people's communes and all finance and trade departments to further mobilize, continue to exert efforts, advance on the crest of victory, spread the spirit of this broadcast conference to every corner, widely launch discussions, make it known to every household, push the national agricultural product procurement movement to a greater high tide, and strive to complete and over fulfill the state's agricultural product procurement task.

    乘胜前进，再接再厉
    完成和超额完成农产品收购任务
    李先念同志在全国农产品收购工作广播大会上讲话
    新华社6日讯　中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李先念同志今天在全国农产品收购工作广播大会上对全国的人民公社、生产大队、生产队的广大社员和干部以及全体财贸干部讲了话。
  已经取得了五个方面的胜利
    李先念同志在讲话中首先对大家在农业战线、财贸战线上取得的伟大成就表示祝贺。他说，我们农业战线和财贸战线，也同其它战线一样，取得了伟大的成就。我们热烈响应党和政府的号召，进行了长期的艰苦的抗灾、保苗斗争，开展了波澜壮阔的保产、超产运动，接着，又投入了千军万马的农产品收购运动，成绩显著，战果辉煌。把农产品收购的战果归纳起来，主要是五个方面的胜利。第一，收获工作做得好，在农业丰产的基础上做到了丰收，实现了党和政府“丰产丰收”的要求。第二，今年农产品收购运动发展迅速，声势浩大，时间集中，比去年提前一个月左右，许多主要农产品的收购数量比去年同期大大增加。从地区上看，从今年夏季粮食登场到现在，全国已经有贵州、青海、甘肃、陕西、山西、四川、河南、广西等八个省、区完成全年粮食征购任务，四川省已经完成了全年棉花收购任务。第三，绝大部分地区在大抓粮食、棉花、油料等主要农产品的生产和收购的同时，还大力开展了多种经营，大搞野生植物原料的“小秋收”运动。因而副产品和土特产品的收购数量也大大增加。第四，全国各地还掀起了群众性的多种蔬菜的热潮，今年全国农村的秋菜产量可达几千亿斤。这样，可以使城市和农村的蔬菜供应量大大增加，改善城市居民和农民的生活。第五，许多地方开展了群众性的农产品加工运动和短途运输运动，保证了收购起来的农产品能够及时加工和及时调运，保证了轻工业原料、国内市场供应和出口货源的需要。
    李先念同志接着说，为什么今年农产品收购工作比过去做得更好呢？为什么农产品收购的成绩这样巨大呢？我们认为这是党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的伟大胜利，是党的群众路线的胜利；是广大农民的群众运动和财贸部门职工的群众运动相互结合的结果，是人民公社制度的伟大胜利。在人民公社党委的统一领导下，能够把农村各项工作统筹兼顾、全面安排；能够充分利用和合理调配劳动力，发挥更大的劳动生产效率，保证农产品收割、打晒、交售、加工和调运等各项工作结合进行。所有这一切都决定于党的领导，政治挂帅。哪里加强了党的领导，哪里就能够很好地贯彻执行党的总路线，哪里的农产品收购工作就能够取得更大的胜利。千条万条，党的领导第一条。这一条今年做得特别好。
    李先念同志说，总路线，群众运动，大跃进，人民公社，党的领导，这就是今年整个国民经济继续跃进和今年农产品收购工作取得巨大成就的根本原因。右倾机会主义分子攻击总路线、群众运动、大跃进、人民公社和党的领导，现在铁一般的事实已经把他们的进攻彻底粉碎了。
    做好收购工作一举四得
    李先念同志说，收购农产品是一项具有重大经济意义和政治意义的工作。把收购工作做好，可以一举四得：可以增加工业原料，可以增加市场货源，可以增加公社积累，可以增加社员收入。粮、棉、油和其他农产品，是轻工业的主要原料，又是人民吃饭穿衣的基本生活资料。完成收购任务，对于工业生产的发展和市场的繁荣，有着极为重要的作用。从农民方面来说，人民公社出售农产品，既可以得到生产资金，用来购买农业机械、新式农具、化肥、农药等生产资料；又可以增加社员的现金收入，进一步改善社员生活。人民政府的收购政策同广大农民的利益是完全一致的。农民同志们都会记得，在解放以前的旧社会，官僚地主和投机商人每到秋后，就压价收购，贱买贵卖，残酷地剥削农民。这种情况在新中国成立以后，早已经一去不复返了。人民政府以公平合理的价格收购农产品，又以公平合理的价格供应农民必需品。在新中国，出售农产品不仅符合于国家的需要，而且是人民公社和广大社员群众的要求。国家利益和农民利益是一致的。广大农民出售农产品的时候，欢天喜地，敲锣打鼓，道理就在这里。还应当看到，完成收购任务，不仅对当前的国民经济发展有重要意义，而且是明年国民经济继续跃进的一个重要条件。我们一定要把这个工作做好。
    李先念同志接着说，现在农产品已经基本收获完毕，农产品收购高潮已经全面形成，并且正在向着更大的高潮发展，农产品收购工作已经进入了决定性的阶段。11月份将是农产品收购取得全胜的决定性的一个月。我们必须紧紧地抓住这个时机，继续反右倾，鼓干劲，乘胜前进，一鼓作气，把应当收购的农产品都及时收购起来，迅速地完成和超额完成农产品收购任务。这是目前摆在各级党委、全体农村工作人员、财贸工作人员和全体农民面前的一个光荣任务，我们大家一定要继续响应党和政府的号召，坚决地、千方百计地完成这个光荣的任务。
    切实做好六项工作
    李先念同志说，为什么要求迅速地及时地完成收购任务呢？这是因为，目前各项工作都在继续向前跃进，在农村中，应兴应办的事情很多。比如大兴水利、积肥造肥、深翻土地、开展多种经营等等，都须要抓紧进行。只有在比较短的时期内把收购工作做好，才能使各级领导和广大农民腾出手来，专心一意地集中力量进行各项生产工作。这样做是完全符合广大农民的利益和要求的。为了及时完成和超额完成农产品收购任务，我们必须切实做好下面六项工作：
    一、继续加强党的领导　大张旗鼓地宣传党的总路线　坚持政治挂帅　大搞群众运动　正确执行政策　把农产品收购运动迅速推向新的更大的高潮
    各级党委在统筹安排农村各项工作的原则下，要进一步加强对农产品收购工作的领导，抓思想，抓政策，抓任务，抓措施，而且要抓得紧，抓得好，抓得细，抓得实。最要紧的是要加强政治思想领导，把政治思想工作渗透到各个阶段、各个环节和各个方面，做到段段有思想工作、步步有思想工作、事事有思想工作。
    在整个农产品收购运动中，既要做好各级干部的政治思想工作，又要做好广大农民的政治思想工作。首先必须做好各级干部的政治思想工作。而且在做好各级干部的思想工作方面，做好生产队干部的思想工作又是一个决定性的环节。因为生产队干部一方面接受国家委托收购农产品，另一方面又是农产品的出售者，国家的农产品收购政策要通过生产队干部传达给广大农民，农产品收购任务要通过生产队干部发动群众来完成。
    要很好地完成农产品收购任务，必须发动群众和依靠群众，大搞群众运动，既要轰轰烈烈，又要踏踏实实。怎样才能把群众充分发动起来？最根本的办法是通过回忆、对比、算账，通过其他方式，大张旗鼓地宣传党的社会主义建设总路线，普遍深入地继续开展反右倾、鼓干劲的社会主义教育。大讲国家建设的高速度发展，大讲人民公社的优越性，大讲城乡互助和工农联盟，大讲国家的农产品收购政策，大讲完成和超额完成农产品收购任务的重要意义。
    在收购工作中，必须正确地执行党和国家的政策，把政策和任务统一起来，合理地兼顾国家、集体和个人的利益，收购工作人员应当注意调查研究，核实产量，按照政策标准的规定，把应当留给农民自用的部分留给农民，把应当由国家收购的部分收购起来。农民群众应当实事求是地报告产量，把应当出售的产品出售给国家，这是农民的光荣任务。
    二、必须以粮、棉、油、猪为中心，保证农产品收购运动的全面发展和平衡发展
    目前的农产品收购运动，总的说来是健康的，发展是迅速的，只是地区之间和品种之间发展还不够平衡。现在收购工作进入决定性时期，我们必须在反右倾、鼓干劲的基础上，加强领导，勤于检查，坚决改变这些地区间、品种间的不平衡状况，保证以粮、棉、油、猪为中心的农产品收购运动能够全面发展和平衡发展。哪个地区有问题，就大力推动哪个地区，哪个品种有问题，就认真抓紧哪个品种，哪个环节薄弱，就切实加强哪个环节。要树标兵、插红旗，及时公布成绩、互相评比，开展社会主义竞赛；要学先进、赶先进、帮落后，抓两头、带中间，相互帮助，共同提高。县级机关应当建立分品种分地区的每日收购进度检查制度，并且规定每天、每五天、每旬的收购进度指标，作为掌握运动和加强领导的具体尺度。各级领导机关必须派出工作组，深入基层，调查研究，现场考察，巡回检查，大力推动收购工作的发展。
    三、必须善始善终　不留尾巴　坚决做好农产品收购的后期工作
    要做好农产品收购的后期工作，决定于两个根本条件。一个条件是，决定于后期工作能不能列入党委的议事日程，继续努力争取全胜。因为越到后期，工作越繁重，政策性越大，如果不把后期工作列入党委的议事日程，而把它完全交给业务部门去搞，那就不可能很好地完成收购任务。另一个条件是，决定于到了收购后期干部和群众是不是继续鼓足干劲，干部和群众的思想问题是不是能够很好地解决。因为到了收购后期，在干部和群众中间往往容易产生松劲情绪。如果不克服这种松劲情绪，后期工作就不可能继续前进。各地必须坚决防止前紧后松的现象，力争农产品收购不留尾巴。在秋冬收购任务完成和超额完成以后，还应当注意做好经常性的收购工作。
    四、应当在执行国家政策的条件下，在妥善安排农村用粮的原则下，尽可能地提高各种农产品的商品率
    把农产品收购工作做好，完成和超额完成农产品收购任务，可以更好地促进公社经济和整个国民经济的发展，对国家、对集体、对个人都有极大的好处。因此，在按照国家规定的标准留下公社和社员的自用部分的原则下，在妥善安排农民口粮、种籽、饲料用粮的原则下，要求各地应当尽可能地提高农产品的商品率，发展国家和公社之间的商品交换。各地在检查收购工作的时候，既要检查任务完成的情况，又要检查政策的执行情况，检查农产品的商品率。
    五、依靠群众和发动群众，大力搞好农产品收购的各项业务工作
    现在农产品的加工和调运，有两种不同的作法，得到的是两种不同的结果。一种作法是，不但要发动和依靠广大农民把应当出售的农产品卖给国家，而且也发动和依靠广大农民来完成农产品的加工和调运工作，充分发挥广大群众的积极性和创造性，大搞技术革新，实行土洋并举，把一切国家的和公社的，机械的和人力的，先进的和落后的工具和设备，都充分地利用起来。这样收购业务工作就能紧紧跟上农民交售运动的发展。另一种作法是，单纯依靠粮食部门和商业部门的人员和设备来搞加工和调运，而不去发动和依靠广大农民群众，结果业务工作总是赶不上运动的发展。我们应当坚决采取前一种作法，在收购工作的各个方面开展广泛的群众运动。
    六、在做好农产品收购工作的同时，必须大力做好农村生产资料和生活资料的供应工作
    我们应当千方百计供应农村的生活资料和生产资料。凡是适合于农村销售的工业品，目前都应当优先供应农村。只有认真做好农村的供应工作，农产品收购工作才能做得更好。应当通过组织工业品和农产品的交换，发展城乡互助，巩固工农联盟。财贸部门必须大力支持农业生产，促进农业实现机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化，促进农业经济的高速度发展。这是一个重大的政治任务。
    李先念同志最后说，目前全国农产品收购运动正处在取得全胜的决定性时刻，机不可失，时不再来。我们要求一切人民公社和一切财贸部门进一步动员起来，再接再厉，乘胜前进，把这次广播大会的精神传遍到每一个角落，广泛地展开讨论，作到家喻户晓，把全国农产品收购运动推向更大的高潮，为完成和超额完成国家的农产品收购任务而奋斗。
