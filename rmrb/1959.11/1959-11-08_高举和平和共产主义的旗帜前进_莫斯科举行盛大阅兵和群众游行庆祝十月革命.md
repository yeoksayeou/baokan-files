Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 7th: According to TASS, a grand military parade and mass procession were held on Red Square in Moscow on November 7th to celebrate the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

Tens of thousands of Muscovites – innovators in industry and agriculture, workers in culture and science, state and social activists, and senior officers of the Soviet army – filled the stands on Red Square. Also on the stands were many foreign guests and foreign diplomatic envoys and military attachés to the Soviet Union. When the leaders of the Soviet Party and government appeared on the reviewing stand, they were greeted with stormy applause.

At 10 a.m., Marshal Malinovsky, the Soviet Minister of Defense, accompanied by Marshal Moskalenko, inspected the troops lined up on Red Square and the surrounding streets. Subsequently, Marshal Malinovsky stepped onto the reviewing stand and delivered a speech to the soldiers and officers of the Soviet Army and Navy, as well as to the Soviet working people and foreign guests.

Marshal Malinovsky emphasized that the most important events of recent times were: the launch of several cosmic rockets by the Soviet Union; these cosmic rockets reached the surface of the moon and circled the moon; the maiden voyage of the "Lenin" atomic icebreaker - all this clearly proves that the October Revolution has opened up unlimited creative possibilities for the people. These events once again confirmed the undeniable superiority of socialism over capitalism. This superiority embodies the great power of the Soviet system.

Malinovsky pointed out that now the Soviet Union is confidently advancing along the road of building the material and technical base of communism, striving to win in the peaceful economic competition with capitalism.

Speaking about the international situation, Marshal Malinovsky emphasized that the balance of power on the world stage is increasingly changing in favor of socialism. The Soviet Communist Party and the government have always unswervingly pursued Lenin's policy of peaceful coexistence, and firmly struggled to consolidate and develop friendly cooperation and mutual understanding between countries.

Malinovsky said that Khrushchev's visit to the United States opened up broad prospects for establishing lasting peace on Earth. Khrushchev's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, with new force, confirmed the sincere peaceful aspirations of the Soviet state, and received the warm support of all progressive mankind.

Marshal Malinovsky said that, however, before our proposals on disarmament are adopted, and before the many American military bases around the Soviet Union are removed, the Party and the government consider it their sacred duty to maintain the high combat readiness of the Soviet armed forces. The Soviet Union is constantly strengthening its army and navy, not to invade other countries, but to reliably guarantee the peaceful labor of the Soviet people in building communism.

After the speech, the military parade began. Traditionally, the cadets of the various military academies led the way. Following the military academy cadets into Red Square were the ranks of the Navy and Border Guards. Those gathered on Red Square warmly welcomed the youngest participants in the parade - students from the Suvorov Military School and the Nakhimov Naval School.

The sound of motorcycles resounded across the square. The Taman Division, which had performed outstandingly in the Great Patriotic War, passed in armored vehicles in front of the reviewing stand, followed by landing troops in automobiles, and the square resounded with enthusiastic applause.

At the end of the column were the artillery units. Guns of various calibers passed in front of the reviewing stand, including entire sets of "Combined Guns" and pairs of anti-aircraft guns. Models of rocket weapons were also reviewed.

The military parade lasted forty minutes. After the military parade, the mass procession began. At the forefront of the procession was a huge model of the moon, surrounded by three models of Soviet cosmic rockets, which were set off by a sea of red flags.

People on the reviewing stand and the reviewing platform gave enthusiastic cheers to a set of working models showing the launching of a rocket to the moon. At this time, a small rocket flew upward with a squeak, released a "sodium cloud" when it reached a certain stage, and then fell onto the "moon," which was a balloon one hundred meters high.

The procession carried portraits of the leaders of the Soviet state. The tens of thousands of Moscow workers participating in the procession reported to the motherland on the successful implementation of the first year's plan of the Seven-Year Plan.

Members of the "Communist Labor Brigades" who were "working, studying and living in the communist way!" passed through the square. These labor brigades symbolize the future that the Soviet people are building.

People on the reviewing stand warmly congratulated the Soviet scientists, designers, and workers - the manufacturers of the "Lenin" atomic icebreaker and interplanetary stations, the manufacturers of the Tu-114 aircraft and computers, atomic reactors, and the latest machine tools.

In an instant, Red Square turned into a field of waving grain. This was the column of workers and collective farmers from state-owned farms in the suburbs of Moscow. Like all Soviet agricultural workers, they were determined to contribute to the fulfillment of the Seven-Year Plan.

A large marching contingent of 10,000 athletes also passed through Red Square.

The word "peace" appeared frequently in the procession. This autumn, this word is expressed with particular pride. Khrushchev's visit to the United States, and his proposal for complete and thorough disarmament at the United Nations General Assembly, filled people's hearts with hope for the establishment of lasting peace in the world.

The Muscovites passing through Red Square paid tribute to the people of all countries fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism. The flags of the socialist camp countries fluttered over the square, and slogans saluting the working people of these countries resounded. The Soviet people expressed their desire for friendly cooperation with the people of the United States, Britain, France, and other countries. The Soviet people warmly saluted the people of all countries who have freed themselves from the shackles of colonialism, and to the people of all countries in the world.

The Moscow people's holiday parade lasted for about two hours, demonstrating the unbreakable unity between the Communist Party and the Soviet people who are building communism.

    莫斯科举行盛大阅兵和群众游行庆祝十月革命
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：11月7日，莫斯科红场上举行盛大的阅兵和群众游行，庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年。
    成千上万的莫斯科人——工农业的革新者、文化科学工作者、国家和社会活动家、苏联军队高级军官——站满了红场的观礼台。在观礼台上的还有许多外国来宾和各国驻苏联外交使节和武官。苏联党和政府的领导人在检阅台上出现时，受到暴风雨般的鼓掌欢迎。
    上午十时，苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅在莫斯卡连科元帅的陪同下，乘车检阅排列在红场上和红场周围街道上的军队。随后，马利诺夫斯基元帅走上检阅台，向苏联陆、海军的士兵、军官以及苏联劳动人民和外国来宾发表演说。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅强调指出，最近时期以来的最重大的事件是：苏联发射了几个宇宙火箭；这些宇宙火箭到达了月球表面和绕过月球；“列宁号”原子破冰船开航——这一切十分清楚地证明：十月革命为人民开辟了无限的创造的可能性。这些事件再一次证实了社会主义对资本主义的无可争辩的优越性。这种优越性体现了苏维埃制度的伟大力量。
      马利诺夫斯基指出，现在，苏联正在满怀信心地沿着建立共产主义物质技术基础的道路前进，争取在同资本主义的和平经济竞赛中取得胜利。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅在谈到国际形势时着重指出，世界舞台上的力量对比越来越向有利于社会主义的方向变化。苏联共产党和政府始终不渝地奉行列宁的和平共处政策，坚定地为巩固和发展各国之间的友好合作和相互谅解而奋斗。
    马利诺夫斯基说，赫鲁晓夫的访问美国为在地球上建立持久和平开辟了广阔的远景。赫鲁晓夫提出的全面彻底裁军的建议，以新的力量证实了苏维埃国家的真诚的和平愿望，得到了全体进步人类的热烈支持。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅说，但是，在我们关于裁军的建议没有被采纳以前，在苏联周围的许多美国军事基地没有撤除以前，党和政府认为自己有神圣的责任来保持苏联武装部队高度的战斗准备状态。苏联不断加强自己的陆海军，不是为了侵犯别的国家，而是为了牢靠地保障苏联人民建设共产主义的和平劳动。
    演说结束以后，阅兵分列式开始。按照传统，走在前面的是各个军事学院的学员们。继军事学院学员之后进入红场的是海军和边防军的队伍。聚集在红场上的人热烈欢迎最年青的阅兵参加者——苏沃洛夫军事学校和纳希莫夫军事学校的学生。
    摩托声响彻广场。在伟大卫国战争中战绩卓著的塔曼师团乘装甲车通过检阅台前面，其后是乘汽车的登陆部队，广场上响起了热烈的掌声表示欢迎。
    走在队伍最后的是炮兵部队。各种口径的大炮通过检阅台前面，其中包括整套整套的“联合炮”、一对一对的高射炮。火箭武器的模型也接受了检阅。
    阅兵历时四十分钟。阅兵结束后，群众游行开始。在游行队伍的最前面的是一个巨大的月球模型，周围有三个苏联宇宙火箭的模型，这些模型被一片红旗的海洋衬托着。
    观礼台和检阅台上的人们对一套表演向月球发射火箭的活动模型发出了热烈的欢呼。这时，一支小小的火箭发出吱吱的响声向上飞去，在飞到某一阶段的时候放出了“钠云”，然后落到“月球”上，这个“月球”是在一百米高空的气球。
    游行队伍高举着苏维埃国家领导人的肖像。参加游行的成千上万的莫斯科劳动者向祖国报告胜利执行七年计划头一年计划的情况。
    “按共产主义的方式工作、学习和生活！”的“共产主义劳动队”队员们通过了广场。这些劳动队象征着苏联人正在建设的未来。
    观礼台上的人向苏联科学家、设计师和工人——“列宁号”原子破冰船和行星际站的制造者，图“一一四”式飞机和计算机、原子反应堆以及最新式机床的制造者热烈祝贺。
    刹那间，红场变成了禾浪起伏的田野。这是莫斯科市郊的国营农场的工人和集体农民的队伍。他们和所有苏联农业工作者一样，决定要为完成七年计划做出贡献。
    由一万名运动员组成的游行大队也走过了红场。
    游行队伍中频频出现“和平”这个字。今年秋天，这个字表现得特别骄傲。赫鲁晓夫的访问美国，他在联合国大会上提出全面彻底裁军的建议，使人们心里充满对世界树立持久和平的希望。
    通过红场的莫斯科人向为争取和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的各国人民致敬。广场上飘扬着社会主义阵营各国的旗帜，响彻着向这些国家的劳动人民致敬的口号声。苏联人表示渴望同美国、英国、法国和其他国家人民友好合作。苏联人民向摆脱了殖民主义束缚的各国人民、向世界各国人民热烈致敬。
    莫斯科人的节日游行持续了约两小时，显示了共产党和正在建设共产主义的苏联人民之间的牢不可破的团结一致。
