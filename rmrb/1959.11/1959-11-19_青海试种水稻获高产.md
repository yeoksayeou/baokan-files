Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 18th. Further successful rice trials have been achieved on the Qinghai plateau. The Baiyazi Production Team of the Laoya Commune in Ledu County, in this province, trialed over 49 mu of rice this year. After inspection, the average yield was over 604 jin per mu; among them, one mu and one li achieved an average yield of 1,006 jin per mu.

The Baiyazi Production Team had previously trialed rice cultivation. After several failures, they finally succeeded in trial planting last year. The more than four mu of rice trialed last year yielded an average of over 420 jin per mu. The establishment of the People's Commune created conditions for further expanding rice trials. This year, based on the successful experience of last year, they formed a rice specialty team, and adopted more effective measures from land preparation to field management. For the one mu and one li of high-yield fields, water leveling was carried out before sowing, and sufficient high-quality fertilizer was applied. Early-maturing and high-yielding fine varieties were used. In terms of irrigation, a gravity irrigation system centered on a reservoir was established to adjust the depth of the water layer according to the different development stages of the rice. In terms of topdressing, a "moderate amount, multiple times" method was adopted, with a total of seven topdressings. Bold attempts and diligent labor finally yielded fruitful results.

    青海试种水稻获高产
    新华社西宁18日电　青海高原上进一步试种水稻成功。这个省乐都县老鸦公社白崖子生产队今年试种的四十九亩多水稻，经过验收，平均亩产六百零四斤多；其中有一亩零一厘，平均亩产一千零六斤。
    白崖子生产队过去就试种过水稻，经过数次失败，终于在去年试种成功。去年试种的四亩多水稻，平均亩产四百二十多斤。人民公社的成立，给进一步扩大试种水稻创造了条件。今年，他们在去年成功经验的基础上，组成了水稻专业队，从整地到田间管理，采取了更加有力的措施。对于一亩零一厘丰产田，播前进行了水中平地，增施了足够的优质肥料，引用早熟丰产的良种。在灌溉方面，建立了以蓄水池为中心的自流灌溉系统，根据水稻不同的发育阶段调节水层深度。在追肥方面，采用“适量多次”的追肥方法，先后共追肥七次。大胆的尝试，辛勤的劳动，终于获得了丰硕的果实。
