    The great October Socialist Revolution ushered in a new era in the international communist movement and human history. Under the glorious leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people, following the victorious path of the October Socialist Revolution, have achieved brilliant victories in the people's democratic revolution, the socialist revolution, and socialist construction. The tremendous achievements and rich experiences gained by the Soviet people in science, technology, and mechanical industry over the past forty-two years have provided a good example and conditions for learning for the construction and development of China's mechanical industry. As the Soviet people, the Chinese people, and the working people of the world are joyously celebrating the 42nd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, it is very meaningful for us to review the Soviet Union's tremendous assistance to China's mechanical industry construction.
    As everyone knows, the old China's mechanical industry, although it experienced nearly a hundred years of development history, was basically a semi-colonial repair and assembly industry that could only do some repairs and tinkering. Apart from being able to manufacture a very small number of ordinary and simple machines, it mainly made some parts and components, or only did assembly and repair work, unable to manufacture complete machines, let alone equipment for producing means of production. In the short ten years since the Chinese people were liberated, China's mechanical industry has fundamentally changed this backward situation and leaped into the advanced technological field of the world's machinery manufacturing industry with a brand-new posture. It has not only completed the transition from repair to manufacturing, but has also entered the stage of manufacturing major, precision, and cutting-edge machinery and equipment; it is not only able to manufacture thousands of kinds of machinery products to supply the needs of various sectors of the national economy and a small number of foreign aid exports, but has also manufactured blast furnaces with a volume of 1,513 cubic meters, primary rolling mills with a roll diameter of 750 millimeters, 2,500-ton free forging hydraulic presses, 72,500-kilowatt hydroelectric generator sets, 50,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator sets, 138-ton mainline electric locomotives, diesel locomotives, various types of automobiles, various types of tractors, jet aircraft, helicopters, 5,000-ton coastal freighters, coordinate boring machines, heavy and large machine tools, television broadcasting equipment and television receivers, modern national defense equipment, and other precision and cutting-edge products. At present, the mechanical industry has basically formed a complete industrial system; its total output value in 1958 increased by nearly forty times compared with 1949, just after liberation. These enormous progress and achievements, while welcomed by our friends, even cause our enemies—the imperialists and their running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique—to feel panic and fear!
    So, how was this glorious victory achieved?
    This is primarily due to the correct leadership of our great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the selfless labor and heroic struggle of the broad masses of mechanical industry workers, the active support of the people of the whole country, and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. This is the most important factor. Undoubtedly, the Soviet Union's sincere, selfless, and multifaceted enormous assistance to China's mechanical industry is also an important factor in China's mechanical industry achieving such a brilliant victory.
    Since the founding of New China, hundreds of modern mechanical factories that play a backbone role have been newly built. More than two hundred old mechanical factories have also been expanded. Most of these factories have been completed or basically completed and put into production. Many of them are modern mechanical factories built with Soviet assistance, equipped with sophisticated technology and equipment. For example, China's first modern automobile production base—Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant—is known as "Automobile City," and the scale of it can be imagined. This factory adopted various new types of machinery equipment and advanced technology. The entire factory is centered on the assembly workshop, forming a large-scale streamlined production organic whole; in addition, there is a complete design and research center. The factory started construction on July 15, 1953, and was successfully completed in only three years by July 15, 1956, and at the same time produced the first batch of domestically produced Jiefang brand automobiles. Now, the Jiefang brand trucks, three-axle cross-country vehicles, automatic dump trucks, sprinkler trucks, gas generator trucks, and Hongqi brand high-end sedans produced by this factory are galloping across China's vast land, serving China's socialist construction cause. At that time, in order to help China quickly build the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the Soviet Union designated more than 20 of their domestic professional design institutions to undertake the design, incorporating the most advanced technology of the existing automobile factories in the Soviet Union into the design; and mobilized more than 100 Soviet machine factories to undertake the manufacture of various equipment, giving priority to the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant for the best equipment. For example, the 3,500-ton giant mechanical press supplied by the Soviet Union was a new product that was successfully trial-produced for the first time in the Soviet Union. In order to manufacture and transport this huge new-style press, the Soviet Union built a new workshop in the Likhachev Automobile Factory in Moscow and designed and manufactured special transportation tools. The Soviet Union also accepted the entire set of production technicians and managers from the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant to intern in their factories, including about 500 people from the factory director, chief engineer, to the engineering technicians and skilled workers in key positions, so that the factory had a large number of technical cadres and skilled workers who could master production from the beginning of production; at the same time, the Soviet Union also sent many excellent experts to China to help the factory's basic construction and production work. Therefore, people call the successful completion of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant "the crystallization of the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples." Although the size of the factory, the nature of production, and the products are different, factories like this "crystallization of the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples" exist in nearly one hundred newly built and expanded mechanical factories in China, such as heavy machinery plants, power station equipment plants, heavy machine tool plants, tractor manufacturing plants, petrochemical machinery plants, precision instrument plants, locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing plants, shipbuilding plants, aircraft manufacturing plants, radio manufacturing plants, machine tool and tool manufacturing plants, etc. The Soviet Union provided comprehensive, systematic, and meticulous assistance to us from the selection of the factory site, collection of data, complete design, complete supply of equipment, assistance in construction, assistance in equipment installation, supply of various product drawings and process documents, production preparation, trial operation to formal commencement of production. In terms of providing technical equipment, since the signing of the first agreement between China and the Soviet Union in 1953 on technical assistance for complete sets of projects for China's construction, until the end of 1958, in these six years alone, the Soviet government provided a large number of the most advanced and first-class machinery equipment for China's complete set of construction projects and general trade orders in the mechanical industry, including heavy machine tools, large vertical lathes, giant gantry milling machines, 2,000-ton flat forging machines, 3,500-ton mechanical presses, 4,000-ton precision presses, and other precision and cutting-edge machinery equipment. At the same time, it delivered the most advanced production process data for more than 1,000 kinds of products, including complete sets of product drawings, operating procedures, process cards, and inspection specifications. When their own communist construction was very busy, the Soviet people also dispatched a large number of experts with sophisticated scientific and technological knowledge and rich practical work experience to China to help with various technical work. The experts regarded the construction cause of the Chinese people as their own, and worked side by side with the Chinese workers. Wherever there were difficulties and problems, they went there to solve them. Their lofty spirit of being serious, responsible, and hardworking left an extremely deep impression on the workers in China's mechanical industry. In order to help cultivate the technical strength of China's mechanical industry, the Soviet Union also accepted thousands of trainees from various units of China's mechanical industry to intern in their mechanical factories with advanced technology and equipment. At the same time, they prepared extremely good internship and living conditions for all Chinese trainees, and selected excellent experts as mentors for the trainees. Thanks to the enthusiastic help and guidance of the Soviet comrades, the Chinese trainees greatly improved their technical and management levels. After returning to China after completing their studies, these trainees have become the technical backbone in China's mechanical industrial enterprises and research and design institutions.
    The Soviet Union not only gave us great assistance in building modern mechanical enterprises, but also helped us rectify and transform old mechanical factories during the period of China's economic recovery, in order to fully utilize the potential of old mechanical factories. Soviet experts further adopted various methods to disseminate Soviet advanced technology and advanced processes, and actively helped us solve many key technical problems, so that the labor productivity and product quality of the mechanical industry were continuously and rapidly improved. For example, Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant was a dilapidated small factory of repair nature before liberation. After liberation, it was transformed and expanded with the help of the Soviet Union. Currently, it is a machine tool manufacturing plant that can produce dozens of kinds of high-efficiency, high-precision lathes, and has a design capacity of more than 7,000 units per year and advanced technology equipment. Dalian Shipyard, one of China's largest shipbuilding bases, also transformed its technology with the help of the Soviet Union, mastered advanced technology and production management experience, and expanded its scale, rapidly developing from a dilapidated stall before liberation into a modern shipbuilding enterprise. In the early days of liberation, it could only manufacture small electric boats of 150 horsepower. Today, it has manufactured 5,000-ton coastal freighters and is manufacturing 10,000-ton ocean-going ships. In terms of increasing the variety of mechanical products, thanks to the Soviet Union's supply of a large amount of complete set of technical data and the vigorous assistance of Soviet experts, we quickly mastered the manufacturing technology of new products, and achieved a wide range of new product categories and serial development. During China's First Five-Year Plan alone, approximately 2,000 new mechanical products were added; and in improving product design, China's design strength was cultivated, so that China's mechanical industry had the ability to gradually transition from imitation to independent design. At present, China is able to independently design 12,500-ton free forging hydraulic presses, primary rolling mills with a roll diameter of 1,150 millimeters, new types of aircraft, automobiles, locomotives, 10,000-ton ocean-going ships, and other major and cutting-edge products with world-class standards, all of which are inseparable from the Soviet Union's technical assistance.
    Another important aspect of the Soviet Union's assistance to the development of China's mechanical industry is the development of scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries. In 1954, China and the Soviet Union signed a scientific and technological cooperation agreement; according to the agreement, various departments of China's mechanical industry successively sent many comprehensive and professional observation groups to the Soviet Union for observation and study. Starting in 1956, direct links were gradually established between some corresponding scientific research institutions and factory laboratories of China and the Soviet Union. In January 1958, China and the Soviet Union signed a protocol on jointly conducting and the Soviet Union assisting China in conducting major scientific and technological research, which included 25 projects related to the mechanical industry. To this end, the Soviet Union sent multiple batches of senior technical personnel to China to give short-term academic lectures and help solve technical problems, which enlightened relevant technical personnel in China. The two sides also exchanged relevant technical data and helped each other around the technical topics of common research.
    Cadres, engineering technicians, and workers at all levels of China's mechanical industry learned various advanced technical experiences of the Soviet Union seriously in their interactions with Soviet experts, and various technical investigation personnel sent to the Soviet Union by China's mechanical industry departments cooperated and progressed together. Through the scientific and technological cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, and through various forms of assistance from the Soviet Union to China's mechanical industry, various scientific research and design forces of China's mechanical industry have been greatly cultivated and developed. At present, China has established specialized scientific research institutions and design institutions for machine tools and tools, heavy machinery, general machinery, instrumentation industry, automobile industry, tractors and agricultural machinery, power station equipment, electrical appliances and electrical materials, radio industry, aviation industry, shipbuilding industry, locomotive and rolling stock industry, etc., and has already played an important role in production and basic construction. These have provided good technical conditions for the continued and continuous great leap forward in China's mechanical industry.
    The sincere and selfless enormous assistance provided by the Soviet Union to China's mechanical industry is completely based on the spirit of proletarian internationalism and follows the principle of equality and mutual benefit. It profoundly embodies the great friendship between socialist countries and the fraternal new type of international relations. As China's great leader Chairman Mao Zedong said: "Look, who designed and equipped so many important factories for us? Did the United States give it to us? Did Britain give it to us? They didn't give it to us. Only the Soviet Union is willing to do so, because it is a socialist country and our allied country. In addition to the Soviet Union, some brotherly countries in Eastern Europe also gave us some help." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") As we warmly celebrate the 42nd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, when the entire people of China are further opposing rightism, encouraging energy, launching a new upsurge of the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy, and striving to fulfill and overfulfill this year's national plan ahead of schedule, we deeply remember the enormous assistance given by the Soviet Union to China's mechanical industry construction. We would like to take this opportunity to once again express our heartfelt gratitude and good wishes to the Soviet people, all the workers of the Soviet mechanical industry, and the Soviet experts who have come to China or are currently in China helping with the production and construction of the mechanical industry! All the workers of China's mechanical industry should continue to seriously, humbly, and realistically learn from the advanced experience and advanced technology of the Soviet mechanical industry, and combine it with China's actual situation and the specific conditions of enterprises; at the same time, under the guidance of the policy of "relying mainly on self-reliance and striving for foreign aid as a supplement," strive for the Soviet Union's continued assistance to China's mechanical industry; in order to make China's mechanical industry achieve more brilliant achievements in the high-speed development of the continuous great leap forward, and strive for greater victories in the second decade!
    Long live the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!

    苏联对我国机械工业建设的巨大援助
    ——庆祝十月社会主义革命四十二周年
    白坚
    伟大的十月社会主义革命在国际共产主义运动和人类历史上开辟了一个新的时代。中国人民在光荣的中国共产党的英明领导下，沿着十月社会主义革命的胜利道路，取得了人民民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设的光辉胜利。苏联人民四十二年来在科学技术和机械工业方面所获得的巨大成就和创造的丰富经验，给我国机械工业的建设和发展提供了良好的学习榜样和学习条件。当苏联人民、中国人民和全世界劳动人民正在欢欣鼓舞地庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年的时候，让我们来回顾一下苏联对我国机械工业建设的巨大援助是十分有意义的。
    大家知道，旧中国的机械工业，虽然经历了近一百年的发展历史，但基本上是一个只能修修配配、敲敲打打的半殖民地的修配性质工业，除了能够制造极少数普通的、简单的机器以外，主要是做一些零件和部件，或者只做装配、修理工作，不能制造完整的机器，更不能制造生产生产资料的设备。在中国人民获得解放后的短短十年来，我国的机械工业已经从根本上改变了这一落后的面貌，以一付崭新的姿态跃进到世界机械制造工业先进技术的领域。它不仅完成了从修配到制造的过渡，而且已经进入了制造重大、精密和尖端机器设备的阶段；它不仅能够制造几千种机器产品以供给国民经济各部门和少数援外出口的需要，而且已经制造了容积为一千五百一十三立方米的炼铁大高炉、轧辊直径为七百五十毫米的初轧机、二千五百吨自由锻造水压机、七万二千五百瓩水轮发电机组、五万瓩汽轮发电机组、一百三十八吨干线用电气机车、内燃机车、各式汽车、各种拖拉机、喷气式飞机、直升飞机、载重量为五千吨的沿海货轮、座标搪床、重型和大型机床、电视广播设备和电视接收机、现代化的国防装备，以及其他一些精密和尖端的产品等等。目前机械工业已经基本上形成了行业齐全的体系；它的生产总值，1958年比刚解放的1949年增长了近四十倍。这些巨大的进步和成就，在我们的朋友们拍手欢迎的时候，连我们的敌人——帝国主义者及其走狗蒋介石卖国集团也不能不感到惊惶和恐惧！
    那末这种光辉的胜利是怎样得来的呢？
    这首先是由于我们伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，广大机械工业职工群众的忘我劳动和英勇奋斗，全国人民的积极支援，以及社会主义制度的无比优越性。这是最主要的因素。毫无疑问，苏联对我国机械工业给予的真诚无私的、多方面的巨大援助，也是我国机械工业取得如此光辉胜利的一个重要因素。
    新中国成立以来，我国新建的现代化的起骨干作用的机械工厂就有成百个。扩建的机械老厂也有二百多个。这些工厂大部分都已建成或基本建成投入生产。其中许多都是苏联援助我国建设的、用精湛的技术和设备装备起来的现代化机械工厂。例如我国第一个现代化的汽车生产基地——长春第一汽车制造厂，人们把它叫做“汽车城”，其规模之大，就可想而知了。这个工厂采用了各种新型机器设备和先进工艺，整个工厂以装配车间为聚集点，组成一个大型流水生产的有机整体；此外还有完整的设计和研究中心。工厂从1953年7月15日开始兴建，到1956年7月15日仅仅经过三年的时间即已胜利建成，同时生产出了第一批国产解放牌汽车。现在这个工厂生产的解放牌载重汽车、三轴越野汽车、自动倾卸车、洒水车、煤气发生炉汽车和红旗牌高级小轿车等，正奔驰在我国的辽阔土地上，为我国的社会主义建设事业服务。当时苏联为了帮助我国迅速建成第一汽车制造厂，曾指定了他们国内二十多个专业设计机构分担设计，把苏联现有汽车厂的最先进技术吸取到设计中去；并动员了苏联一百多个机器厂承制各种设备，把最好的设备优先供给第一汽车制造厂。如苏联供给的三千五百吨巨型机械压床，在苏联还是第一次试制成功的新产品，为了制造和运输这一巨大的新式压床，苏联在莫斯科利哈乔夫汽车厂新建了一个车间，并设计和制造了专门的运输工具。苏联并接受了第一汽车制造厂整套的生产技术人员和管理人员去他们的工厂实习，其中包括从厂长、总工程师一直到主要环节的工程技术人员和技术工人等等共约五百余人，使该厂一开始生产就有大批能够掌握生产的技术干部和技术工人；同时苏联还派遣了许多优秀的专家来我国帮助该厂的基本建设和生产工作。因此，人们都把第一汽车制造厂胜利的建成称为“中苏两国人民伟大友谊的结晶”。像这种“中苏两国人民伟大友谊的结晶”，虽然工厂规模的大小不同，生产性质和产品不一样，但在我国机械工厂中却有新建和扩建的近一百个，如重型机器厂、电站设备厂、重型机床厂、拖拉机制造厂、石油化工机械厂、精密仪表厂、机车车辆制造厂、船舶制造厂、飞机制造厂、无线电制造厂、机床与工具制造厂等等。苏联从选择厂址、搜集资料、成套设计、成套供应设备、帮助施工、帮助安装设备、供给各种产品图纸和工艺文件、进行生产准备、试运转一直到正式开工生产，都对我们进行了全面的、系统的、无微不至的帮助。在提供技术装备方面，自1953年中苏两国签订第一个对中国建设成套项目技术援助的协定以来，至1958年底止，仅在这六年内苏联政府为我国机械工业的成套建设项目和一般贸易订货即提供了大量的、最先进的、第一流的机器设备，其中包括有重型机床、大型立车、巨型龙门铣床、二千吨平锻机、三千五百吨机械压床、四千吨精压机，以及其他一些精密和尖端的机器设备。同时并交付了一千多种产品的最先进的生产工艺资料，包括全套产品图纸、操作规程、工艺卡片，以及检验规范等。苏联人民在自己的共产主义建设十分繁忙的时候，还先后派遣了大批的具有精湛科学技术知识和丰富实际工作经验的专家来我国帮助各种技术工作。专家们把我国人民的建设事业看做自己的事业一样，和我国的职工们并肩劳动，那里有困难和问题，就到那里去解决。他们那种认真负责和辛勤工作的崇高精神，在我国机械工业职工中留下了极其深刻的印象。为了帮助培养我国机械工业的技术力量，苏联并接受了我国机械工业各单位数以千计的实习生到他们拥有先进技术装备的机械工厂中去进行实习，同时为我国所有的实习生准备了极其良好的实习和生活条件，选择了优秀的专家作为实习生的导师。由于苏联同志们的热心帮助和教导，我国的实习生都大大地提高了自己的技术和管理水平。这些实习生学成回国后，已经成为我国机械工业企业和研究、设计机构中的技术骨干力量了。
    苏联不仅在建设现代化的机械企业方面给了我们巨大的援助，而且在我国经济恢复时期，就帮助我们整顿机械老厂、改造机械老厂，以充分发挥机械老厂的潜力。苏联专家更进一步采用各种方式传播苏联的先进技术和先进工艺，积极帮助我们解决了许多关键性的技术问题，使机械工业的劳动生产率和产品质量得到不断地、迅速地提高。例如沈阳第一机床厂在解放前是一个修配性质的破旧小厂，解放后在苏联的帮助下进行了改造和扩建，目前已经是一个能生产数十种高效率、高精度车床的、设计能力达到年产七千多台的、具有先进技术装备的机床制造厂了。我国最大的造船基地之一——大连造船厂，也是在苏联的帮助下，改造了技术，掌握了先进的技术和生产管理经验，扩大了规模，从解放前的破烂摊子上迅速地发展成了一个现代化的造船企业。解放初期只能制造一百五十马力的小电船，今天它已经制造出了载重量五千吨的沿海货轮，并且正在制造载重量万吨的远洋巨轮。在增加机械产品品种方面，由于苏联供给我们大量的成套技术资料，由于苏联专家的大力帮助，使我们迅速地掌握了新产品的制造技术，并做到新产品门类多，又能成系列地发展。仅在我国第一个五年计划期间，就增加了大约两千种机械新产品；并在改进产品设计中培养了我国的设计力量，使我国机械工业具备了从仿造逐步过渡到自行设计的能力。目前我国能够自行设计一万二千五百吨自由锻造水压机、轧辊直径一千一百五十毫米的初轧机、新型的飞机、汽车、机车、万吨远洋轮船，以及其他一些重大和尖端的具有世界水平的产品，都是和苏联在技术上的帮助分不开的。
    苏联援助我国机械工业发展的另一个重要方面是两国科学技术合作的开展。1954年中苏两国签订了科学技术合作协定；根据协定，我国机械工业各部门先后派出了许多综合性的和专业性的考察团到苏联进行考察学习。从1956年开始，中苏双方一部分相应的科学研究机构和工厂实验室之间即陆续建立了直接联系的关系。1958年1月中苏两国又签订了中苏关于共同进行和苏联帮助中国进行重大科学技术研究的议定书，其中有关机械工业方面的项目有二十五个。苏联为此派遣了多批的高级技术人员来我国作短期的学术讲学和帮助解决技术疑难问题，使我国有关的技术人员得到了有益的启发。双方还围绕共同研究的技术课题，相互交换了有关的技术资料，互相帮助。
    我国机械工业各级干部、工程技术人员和工人在和苏联专家的相处中，以及我国机械工业部门先后派往苏联的各种技术考察人员，都认真地学习苏联的各种先进技术经验，并且互助合作，共同前进。通过中苏两国的科学技术合作，通过苏联对我国机械工业的各种帮助，大大地培养并发展了我国机械工业的各种科学研究和设计力量。现在我国已经建立起了机床与工具、重型机械、通用机械、仪表工业、汽车工业、拖拉机和农业机械、电站设备、电器电材、无线电工业、航空工业、船舶工业、机车车辆工业等等专业科学研究机构和设计机构，并且已经在生产和基本建设中发挥了重要的作用。这些都为我国机械工业的继续不断大跃进提供了良好的技术条件。
    苏联给予我国机械工业的真诚无私的巨大援助，是完全本着无产阶级国际主义的精神，遵循着平等互利的原则来进行的，它深刻地体现了社会主义国家之间的伟大友谊和兄弟般的新型的国际关系。正如我国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席所说的：“大家看吧，谁给我们设计和装备了这么多的重要工厂呢？美国给我们没有？英国给我们没有？他们都不给。只有苏联肯这样做，因为它是社会主义国家，是我们的同盟国家。除了苏联以外，东欧一些兄弟国家也给了我们一些帮助。”（“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”）当我们热烈地庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年的时候，当我国全体人民正在进一步反右倾、鼓干劲、掀起轰轰烈烈的增产节约群众运动新高潮、力争提前和超额完成今年的国家计划的时候，我们对苏联给予我国机械工业建设的巨大援助是深感不忘的。我们愿意借这个机会，向苏联人民、苏联机械工业全体职工和曾经来过我国或正在我国帮助机械工业生产建设的苏联专家同志们，再一次地表示衷心的感谢和良好的祝愿！我国机械工业的全体职工还应该继续认真地、虚心地、实事求是地学习苏联机械工业的先进经验和先进技术，并且把它与我们中国的实际情况、企业的具体条件结合起来；同时在“自力更生为主、争取外援为辅”的方针指导下，争取苏联对我国机械工业的继续援助；为使我国机械工业在不断大跃进的高速度发展中取得更加辉煌的成就、在第二个十年内取得更加伟大的胜利而奋斗！
    中苏两国人民的伟大友谊万古长青！
