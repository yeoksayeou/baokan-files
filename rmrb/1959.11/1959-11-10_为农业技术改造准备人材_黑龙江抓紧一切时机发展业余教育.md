Main experience: Seize the opportunity to organize mass learning upsurges, from upsurge to regularity, and from regularity to new upsurges, one wave higher than the last, to achieve year-round persistent learning; with production as the center, production and learning are unified in arrangement, unified in inspection, and unified in evaluation and reward, so as to encompass both production and learning.

(Based on a report by this newspaper) Harbin News - Heilongjiang Province, the first province in the country to basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, has achieved great accomplishments this year in actively eliminating remaining illiteracy and consolidating the development of spare-time education. In order to meet the needs of agricultural construction and prepare talent for the realization of agricultural technological transformation, the entire province is launching a continuous great leap forward upsurge to advance towards culture.

Currently, there are approximately 1.7 million young and middle-aged farmers in Heilongjiang Province studying in the thousands of spare-time middle schools run by more than 600 rural people's communes and the tens of thousands of spare-time primary schools run by management districts or production teams. Among them, one million are in higher primary or junior middle school classes. Throughout the province, a number of production teams, management districts, and people's communes have emerged that have completely eliminated remaining illiteracy, and some cities and counties, such as Ning'an, Kedong, and Tonghe, will eliminate all remaining illiteracy. Some counties have also basically universalized primary school education.

Seizing all favorable opportunities to organize mass learning upsurges, from upsurge to regularity, and from regularity to new upsurges, and moreover, overcoming the three major "busy" periods of spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvest wave after wave, to achieve year-round persistent learning, is a major characteristic of Heilongjiang Province in actively eliminating remaining illiteracy and consolidating the development of spare-time education. After the province basically eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people last May Day, it immediately advanced victoriously and launched a "read one hundred books, write ten thousand characters, read the newspaper every day" movement throughout the province, enabling the more than one million young and middle-aged farmers who had just become literate to generally read about twenty booklets on literature, art, agricultural technology, etc., and through forms such as writing poetry, reading newspapers, story meetings, and report meetings, consolidating and expanding the results of illiteracy elimination. In the past winter and this spring, tens of thousands of spare-time schools were established in rural areas throughout the province, making spare-time learning regular. Since the beginning of this year, the province and various localities have continued to carry out mass movements on a large scale, cultivating typical examples and establishing pacesetters at all levels, and using favorable opportunities such as before spring plowing and after summer weeding, several on-the-spot meetings, educational meetings, and radio conferences, to introduce and promote advanced experiences, using points to lead the surface, so that the province's work of eliminating remaining illiteracy and developing spare-time education has continued to show a leap forward situation. During the most intense autumn harvest stage this year, more than 700,000 farmers persisted in spare-time learning.

Deeply implementing the Party's education policy, based on taking production as the center and implementing unified arrangements, unified inspections, and unified evaluation and reward for production and learning, so as to encompass both production and learning, is another main reason for Heilongjiang Province's elimination of remaining illiteracy and the consolidation and development of spare-time education work achieving continuous leap forward. For example, the Kedong County Party Committee members and cadres of various communes and management districts, while leading the communes, management districts, and production teams in production by dividing up areas of responsibility, also took responsibility for learning. In the past six months, the county held seven meetings on farmer education work, organized five joint large-scale inspections, and before the start of the autumn harvest, the county party committee also held a telephone conference specifically to deploy how to do a good job in farmers' spare-time learning in coordination with production during the autumn harvest, so that 92% of the young and middle-aged people who should be enrolled in the county persisted in learning during the autumn harvest. The Bin County Party Committee comprehensively deployed production and learning at every stage of agricultural production, and at the same time, combined with the ever-changing situation of the great leap forward in production, correspondingly changed the organization, leadership, form, and time of learning, adopting flexible methods such as combining centralized teaching with extracurricular self-study, books following people, teachers and instructors following students, and classrooms following production sites, tightly linking production and learning. At the same time, it proposed the slogan of "Learn more when not busy, learn less when very busy, strive to learn fully on rainy days, and persist in learning regularly," so as to achieve a double leap forward in production and learning.

In addition, the people's communes have also brought favorable conditions for eliminating remaining illiteracy and consolidating the development of spare-time education. After communization, the prospects for accelerating the realization of rural mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members to urgently demand to master cultural and scientific knowledge as soon as possible. Areas that were originally active in running schools, teaching, and participating in learning became even more energetic; in counties where rural spare-time education was previously poorly developed, the general enrollment rate of young and middle-aged farmers also increased to more than 70%. At the same time, the people's communes held collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens and nurseries, which also brought convenient conditions for spare-time learning, such as organizing learning in the canteen on the spot after meals and extending nursery time.

    为农业技术改造准备人材
    黑龙江抓紧一切时机发展业余教育
    主要经验抓紧时机组织群众性学习高潮，从高潮到经常，从经常又转入新的高潮，一浪高过一浪，达到常年坚持学习；以生产为中心，对生产和学习统一安排，统一检查，统一评比奖励，作到既包生产又包学习。
    本报讯　全国第一个基本上扫除青壮年文盲的黑龙江省，今年在积极扫除剩余文盲，巩固发展业余教育的工作中，又取得了很大成就。为了适应农业建设的需要，为实现农业的技术改造准备好人材，全省正在掀起一个向文化进军的继续跃进的高潮。
    目前，黑龙江省大约有一百七十多万青壮年农民，正在全省六百多个农村人民公社办的成千所业余中学和管理区或生产队举办的上万个业余小学里学习。其中在高小或初中班的就有一百万人。全省各地已经出现了一批全部扫除了剩余文盲的生产队、管理区和人民公社，一部分市、县，如宁安、克东、通河等县剩余文盲都将全部扫除。有的县还基本上普及了小学教育。
    抓紧一切有利时机，组织群众性的学习高潮，从高潮到经常，从经常又转入到新的高潮，而且一浪高过一浪地闯过春耕、夏锄、秋收三个大“忙”关，达到常年坚持学习，这是黑龙江省在积极扫除剩余文盲及巩固发展业余教育工作中的一个很大特点。在去年“五一”全省基本扫除青壮年文盲以后，立即乘胜前进，在全省范围内开展了一个“读百本书，写万个字，天天读报”运动，使刚刚脱盲的一百多万青壮年农民一般都阅读了二十来本文艺、农业技术等小册子，并通过写诗、读报、故事会、报告会等形式，巩固和扩大了扫除文盲的成果。在去冬今春，全省农村办起了数以万计的业余学校，使业余学习做到经常化。今年以来，省和各地又坚持大搞群众运动，层层培养典型、树立标兵，并利用春耕前，夏锄后等有利时机，几次现场会议，教育会议，广播大会等，介绍和推广先进经验，以点带面使全省的扫除剩余文盲和发展业余教育工作，继续出现了跃进的局面。在今年最紧张的秋收阶段，还有七十多万农民坚持了业余学习。
    深入贯彻党的教育方针，本着以生产为中心，对生产和学习实行统一安排、统一检查、统一评比奖励，作到既包生产，又包学习，这是黑龙江省扫除剩余文盲和巩固发展业余教育工作，实现继续跃进的另一个主要原因。例如克东县县委委员、各公社及管理区干部在分片包干领导公社、管理区、生产队生产的同时，也负责包管学习。半年来全县召开七次有关农民教育工作会议，组织五次联合大检查，县委在秋收开始前，还召开电话会议专门部署秋收期间如何配合生产搞好农民业余学习，因而使全县在秋收中仍有占应入学青壮年92％的人，坚持了学习。宾县县委在每个农业生产阶段，都全面部署生产和学习，同时结合生产大跃进的千变万化情况，相应地改变学习的组织领导、形式、时间，采取集中教学和课外自学相结合，书本跟人走，教师、辅导员跟学员走，课堂跟生产场所走，教学内容跟生产内容走等灵活的方式，把生产和学习紧紧地扭在一起。同时提出：“不忙多学、大忙少学、雨天争取全学、坚持经常学”的口号，做到生产和学习双跃进。
    此外，人民公社也给扫除剩余文盲和巩固发展业余教育带来了有利条件。公社化以后对加速实现农村机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化所展现的前景，大大地激发了广大社员迫切要求尽快掌握文化科学知识的积极性。原来办学、教学和参加学习积极的地区更起劲了；原来开展农村业余教育较差的县份，青壮年农民一般的入学率也增加到70％以上。同时，人民公社举办了公共食堂、托儿所等集体福利事业，也给业余学习带来了方便条件。如饭后时间就地在食堂组织学习，延长托儿时间等。
