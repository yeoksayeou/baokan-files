Shining with the Radiance of Communism

Zhao Mengtao, a fine yarn tender at the Northwest State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 1 in Shaanxi Province, firmly remembers the Party's teaching: "A Communist Party member and advanced producer should not only play an exemplary leading role themselves, but more importantly, help the masses advance together." As far back as six years ago, she noticed that although her own production results were good, some comrades in her group often failed to complete the state plan. Recalling the Party's education when she joined, she and the other Communist Party members in the group identified the key reason why other members could not complete the plan: slow piecing and many knots. She then resolved to teach them her piecing experience. After learning, Zhai Fulan increased her piecing speed from twelve ends per minute to twenty, catching up with her. Zhai Fulan immediately taught the new worker Niu Lingling, who also caught up to the advanced level, and the plan was completed better day by day... In this way, one person taught another, and advanced experience was quickly mastered by all the comrades in the group. The average piecing speed of the group increased from eight ends per minute to sixteen, which ensured the completion of the state plan.

She always treats other people's tasks as her own and other people's difficulties as her own. When others cannot complete their tasks and feel that the machines are difficult to manage, she takes the initiative to go to the difficult-to-manage machines to overcome the difficulties. Since the beginning of this year, she has exchanged machines with others seven times. For example, Comrade Meng Jindi in the group failed to complete her plan for a period last year. The group held a meeting to criticize her, saying that she affected the completion of the group's plan. At that time, Meng Jindi said at the meeting: "It's not that I don't want to complete the plan, but the machine is really difficult to manage, and the group leader doesn't help me think of a solution." As she spoke, she began to cry. Zhao Mengtao also knew that this machine was more difficult to manage, and Meng Jindi had been transferred there because another comrade could not manage it. At this time, Zhao Mengtao thought: I am a Communist Party member and an advanced producer. If I don't help other comrades when they have difficulties, I am not fulfilling my responsibility. She took the initiative to exchange machines with Meng Jindi. After the exchange, the machine was indeed difficult to manage. Because this machine had new leather rings, the spindles also had problems, and there were two different yarn counts, resulting in many breakages. In the face of these difficulties, she did not shrink back, but tried every means to overcome them and make the machine obey her command. She came to work early and left late every day to clean up the machine; she marked where there were problems while tending the machine and asked the group leader to help repair them. Because she gradually learned some maintenance work, she could repair some minor problems herself. This difficult-to-manage machine was tamed by her, and the plan was also completed. Someone said to her, "When you come here, it seems like the machines are afraid of you."

In May of this year, because the composition of the cotton blend changed, making the work more difficult, it was quite difficult to complete the plan. The Third Group in her shift performed particularly poorly, becoming the key reason why the entire shift failed to complete the plan. The comrades in the Third Group all believed that the failure to complete the plan was because the machines were difficult to manage. Seeing that the Third Group was not completing the plan, she was very anxious. At this time, the Party branch decided to transfer her and two other comrades to support the Third Group, and she was extremely happy. After arriving at the Third Group, she chose the "most difficult-to-manage machine" tended by Meng Yindi. She first understood the situation of the machine, mastered the law of breakages, and made preparations. The effect was very good on the first day, with thirty taels less white waste than before. With their help and encouragement, the comrades in the Third Group were also very motivated, and this day they produced eight kilograms less white waste. At this point, the comrades in the Third Group all realized that whether the plan was completed well or not depended on people, not machines. No one said that the machines were difficult to manage anymore, and they asked them to demonstrate and learn the techniques. From June onwards, the Third Group completed the plan every month and became an advanced group in one fell swoop.

    闪烁着共产主义的光辉
    陕西省西北国棉一厂的细纱挡车工赵梦桃，牢牢记住党的教导：“一个共产党员和先进生产者，不仅要自己起模范带头作用，更主要的是要帮助群众和自己一道前进。”远在六年以前，她就发现虽然自己的生产成绩不坏，但她所在的小组，有几个同志往往不能完成国家计划。她想起入党时党的教育，就同组里的共产党员一起找到了其他组员完不成计划的关键是接头慢，疙瘩多，便下决心把自己的接头经验教给她们。翟福兰学习后，每分钟由原来接十二根，提高到二十根，赶上了她。翟福兰又马上教给新工人牛玲玲，牛玲玲也赶上了先进水平，计划一天比一天完成得好……就这样，一个传一个，先进经验很快就被全组同志掌握了。小组接头，每分钟平均由八根提高到十六根，这就保证了国家计划的完成。
    她总是把别人的任务当做自己的任务，把别人的困难当做自己的困难。当别人完不成任务感到车子不好看管的时候，她就主动到难看管的车子上去征服困难。今年以来她已七次跟人家换车了。比如，小组里的孟金弟同志，去年有一个时期老完不成计划，小组开会批评，说孟金弟影响了小组计划的完成。当时，孟金弟在会上说：“我也不是不想完成计划，车子实在难看，组长也不帮我想想办法。”说着就哭起来了。赵梦桃也知道这部车子比较难看，原先就因为另一个同志看不了这部车，才把孟金弟调去的。这时赵梦桃想：自己是个共产党员，又是先进生产者，当别的同志有困难的时候，自己不去帮助，就是没有尽到自己的责任。她就主动跟孟金弟换车。换车后，车子果真难看。因为这部车换的是新皮圈，锭子也有毛病，又是两种纱支，断头很多。在这些困难面前，她没有退缩，而是想尽办法征服困难，使车子听人使唤。每天早上班，晚下班，把车子收拾好；在看车中发现哪里有毛病就打上记号，请组长帮助修理。由于逐步学会一些检修工作，一些小毛病自己可以修理。这台难看的车子被她驯服了，计划也完成了。有人对她说：“你到这里来，好像车子都怕你一样。”
    今年5月，因为配棉成分改变，生活比较难做，完成计划相当吃力，她的同班三组计划完成得特别差，成为全班完不成计划的关键。三组的同志都认为完不成计划是因为车子不好看。她看到三组完不成计划，心里很着急，这时党支部决定抽调她和其他两位同志去支援三组，她高兴极了。她到三组后，就挑选了孟银弟看的那台“最难看的车子”。先了解车子的情况，掌握了断头规律，并作好准备工作，第一天效果就很好，白花比原来少出三十两。在她们的帮助带动下，三组的同志干劲也很大，这一天就少出白花八公斤。这一下三组的同志都认识到计划完成的好不好，决定的是人不是机器，再没有人说车子不好看了，并要求她们表演，学习技术。从6月以后三组就月月完成计划，一跃而为先进小组。
