Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 2nd. Vietnamese Democratic Republic Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong sent a telegram today to Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina, regarding the Lao Kingdom government's decision to illegally try Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front. The telegram stated that the Lao Kingdom government is preparing to hand Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front over to a criminal court for "trial" today—November 2, 1959, on the so-called charge of "rebellion."

The telegram pointed out that Prince Souphanouvong, as the leader of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and the chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front, is a patriotic figure particularly beloved by the Lao people. Prince Souphanouvong is also the person who signed the Vientiane Agreements with the Lao Kingdom government and is a member of the National Assembly, having made many contributions to Laos' national harmony and national unity.

The telegram emphasized that the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements explicitly guarantee that there should be no discrimination against personnel of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, guarantee all the free and democratic rights of the Lao people, and guarantee the free activities of the Lao Patriotic Front. The arrest, imprisonment, and trial of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front once again blatantly violate the Geneva Agreements on Laos and the Vientiane Agreements, further worsening the Lao situation and threatening peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong stated that, as a signatory to the Geneva Agreements on Laos, the Vietnamese Democratic Republic strongly opposes the aforementioned actions of the Lao Kingdom government. The government of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic hopes that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference will take urgent measures to stop the dangerous actions of the Lao Kingdom government, restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, and alleviate the tense situation in Laos.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 2nd. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic issued a statement today refuting the slanderous remarks made by Lao Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone at a press conference in Washington on October 30, accusing the Vietnamese Democratic Republic of "interfering in Laos."

Phoui Sananikone, reversing black and white, said that the Vietnamese Democratic Republic "instigated" the Pathet Lao Fighting Units to "try to undermine the Geneva Agreements that the Lao Kingdom government has always respected."

The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the government of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic has consistently pursued a policy of peaceful coexistence and hopes to establish good-neighborly relations with the Lao Kingdom on the basis of mutual respect and strict implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Laos. However, under the instigation of US imperialism, the Lao Kingdom government has seriously violated the Geneva Agreements on Laos and colluded with US imperialism in an attempt to realize its conspiracy to turn Laos into a US military base. While thousands of tons of weapons and hundreds of US military advisors were being transported into Laos, the Phoui Sananikone government intensified its suppression of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units and former resistance personnel in Laos. In order to realize the aforementioned conspiracy, the Phoui Sananikone government has tried every means to abolish the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos.

The spokesman pointed out that while the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos has temporarily ceased its activities, US imperialism is increasingly deepening its interference in Laos, and the Phoui Sananikone government is even more seriously violating the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements. Under the instigation of US imperialism, the Phoui Sananikone government expanded the civil war in Laos and accepted emergency "aid" from US imperialism. New US weapons and a large number of military advisors are continuously being transported into Laos. More seriously, the Phoui Sananikone government brazenly decided to "try" Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

The spokesman said that in order to deceive public opinion, evade responsibility, and cover up US interference in Laos, Phoui Sananikone has instead slandered the Vietnamese Democratic Republic for interfering in Laos and falsely claimed that the Lao Kingdom "respects" the Geneva Agreements on Laos.

The Foreign Ministry spokesman emphasized that the government of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic strongly opposes the aforementioned baseless slanders by Phoui Sananikone. The government of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic demands that the Geneva Agreements on Laos must be strictly implemented, and the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos must be restored.

The spokesman said that the government of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic is convinced that Phoui Sananikone's shameless statement will not deceive anyone; on the contrary, it will further expose his vicious conspiracy.

    范文同向日内瓦会议两位主席紧急呼吁
    制止老挝当局迫害苏发努冯
    越南外交部驳斥萨纳尼空毫无根据的诬蔑
    新华社河内2日电　越南民主共和国政府外交部长范文同今天就老挝王国政府决定非法审判苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人一事打电报给1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议两位主席苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和英国外交大臣劳埃德。电报说，老挝王国政府准备在今天——1959年11月2日，以所谓“进行叛乱”的罪名把苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人送交刑事法院“审讯”。
    电报指出，苏发努冯亲王作为前寮国战斗部队的领袖和老挝爱国战线党的主席，是得到老挝人民特别敬爱的爱国人士。苏发努冯亲王还是同老挝王国政府签订万象协议的人，并且是国民议会议员，是为老挝的民族和睦和国家统一作出了许多贡献的人。
    电报着重指出，日内瓦协议和万象协议明确保证不得对前寮国战斗部队人员加以歧视，保证老挝人民的一切自由民主权利，保证老挝爱国战线党的自由活动。对苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的逮捕、监禁和审讯，再一次明目张胆地违反了关于老挝的日内瓦协议和万象协议，使老挝局势更加恶化，威胁了印度支那和东南亚的和平。
    范文同外长表示，作为签订关于老挝的日内瓦协议的一方，越南民主共和国极力反对老挝王国政府的上述行动。越南民主共和国政府希望日内瓦会议两位主席采取紧急的措施来制止老挝王国政府的上述危险行动，使苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人恢复自由，使老挝的紧张局势得到缓和。
    新华社河内2日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人今天发表声明，驳斥老挝首相培·萨纳尼空10月30日在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上诬蔑越南民主共和国“干涉老挝”的谰言。
    培·萨纳尼空颠倒黑白地说，越南民主共和国“唆使”寮国战斗部队“设法破坏老挝王国政府一向非常尊重的日内瓦协议”。
    外交部发言人说，越南民主共和国政府始终不渝地奉行和平共处政策，并且希望在双方共同尊重和严正履行关于老挝的日内瓦协议的基础上同老挝王国建立睦邻关系。但是，老挝王国政府在美帝国主义的唆使下，严重地违反了关于老挝的日内瓦协议，并且勾结美帝国主义，企图实现把老挝变成美国的军事基地的阴谋。当成千吨武器和成百名美国军事顾问被运进老挝的时候，培·萨纳尼空政府变本加厉地镇压寮国战斗部队和老挝前抗战人员。为了实现上述阴谋，培·萨纳尼空政府想尽办法来取消老挝国际委员会。
    发言人指出，在老挝国际委员会暂时停止活动的时候，美帝国主义越来越加深对老挝的干涉，培·萨纳尼空政府也更加严重地破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议。在美帝国主义的唆使下，培·萨纳尼空政府扩大了老挝的内战，接受了美帝国主义的紧急“援助”。美国的新式武器和大批军事顾问源源不断地运进老挝。更严重的是，培·萨纳尼空政府悍然决定“审判”苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人。
    发言人说，为了欺骗舆论、逃避责任和掩盖美国对老挝的干涉，培·萨纳尼空却诬蔑越南民主共和国干涉老挝，并且妄称老挝王国“尊重”关于老挝的日内瓦协议。
    外交部发言人强调指出，越南民主共和国政府极力反对培·萨纳尼空上述毫无根据的诬蔑。越南民主共和国政府要求，必须严正履行关于老挝的日内瓦协议，必须恢复老挝国际委员会的活动。
    发言人说，越南民主共和国政府确信，培·萨纳尼空的无耻的声明骗不了任何人，相反地，更加暴露了他的恶毒的阴谋。
