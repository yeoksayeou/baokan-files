Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, November 23rd: TASS, Mexico City, November 22nd: Soviet First Deputy Premier Mikoyan said at the opening ceremony of the Soviet Science, Technology and Culture Achievement Exhibition in Mexico City on the 21st: "Colonialism is heading disgracefully towards its end, and it will disappear forever from the history of human society."

Mikoyan said: "The Soviet people attach great importance to Mexico, a country with an ancient culture, whose people value their national independence above all else."

Mikoyan then talked about the great achievements the Soviet people have made in all aspects since the founding of the country. He said: "The Soviet Union is now the second industrial power, while pre-revolutionary Russia ranked only fifth in the world. This year, our total industrial output value will be almost forty times the industrial output value of Tsarist Russia in 1913, and it will increase by 4.7 times compared with the pre-war industrial output value of the Soviet Union in 1940. Soviet agriculture is also developing at a high speed. In 1958, our total agricultural output value increased by 2.2 times compared with Tsarist Russia in 1913."

Mikoyan then cited many figures to illustrate the development of the Soviet Union in culture, education, and living welfare. He said, "For the Soviet government, there is no deeper concern than to more fully and comprehensively meet the material needs of every Soviet person."

Mikoyan said: "People should remember that we do not exploit colonies; we have no concessions in other countries - foreign monopolies have plundered unimaginable huge profits from these concessions. Such sources of wealth have nothing in common with our worldview."

Mikoyan then said, "The Soviet people are deeply convinced that they will be able to win in the peaceful economic competition with the United States, thereby proving the incomparable superiority of the socialist economic system."

Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, November 23rd: TASS, Mexico City, November 21st: Soviet First Deputy Premier Mikoyan made a speech at a banquet held in his honor by the "Abasto" Slaughter and Refrigeration Joint Company on the evening of the 20th. Mikoyan pointed out that the Soviet Union is catching up with and surpassing the United States in material production, and has already surpassed the United States in culture, science, and technology. He said that the Soviet Union will graduate 119,000 engineers with higher education degrees in this academic year alone, which is three and a half times the number in the United States. In terms of artificial earth satellites, Soviet artificial earth satellites entered space earlier than the United States. In these areas, we have nothing to catch up with, let them catch up with us. Of course, I do not advocate that they catch up with us in combat intercontinental rockets, because we hope to destroy all of our and their armaments.

Mikoyan said that in terms of material production volume, we are indeed behind the United States, but we are now rapidly catching up with the United States. Our steps are so big that the US Congress has repeatedly discussed when we will catch up with them. Why are they so concerned about us catching up with and surpassing them? We do this not by relying on them, but by relying on ourselves and our own labor. Why could they overtake Britain and France in the past, but we, the Soviet Union, cannot catch up with and surpass the United States now? Who gave the United States the right to always be ahead? I think that one day, Mexicans will also give themselves this task.

Mikoyan finally said that the policy of the Soviet state is to exclude war as a means of solving international problems, eliminate the Cold War, establish greater trust among the people of all countries, respect each other, and not interfere in each other's internal affairs. Let us start a peaceful competition.

Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, November 23rd: TASS, Mexico City, November 22nd: Soviet First Deputy Premier Mikoyan began a four-day visit to Mexico on the 22nd.

    米高扬在墨西哥发表讲话
    苏联经济正在迅速赶上美国
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社墨西哥城22日讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬21日在墨西哥首都举行的苏联科学、技术和文化成就展览会开幕式上说：“殖民主义正在不光彩地走向它的末日，它将从人类社会历史上永远消失。”
    米高扬说：“苏联人民很重视墨西哥这个有着古代文化的国家，它的人民把自己的民族独立看得高于一切。”
    米高扬接着谈到苏联人民自从建国以来在各方面取得的巨大成就。他说：“苏联现在是第二个工业强国，而革命前的俄国在世界上只占第五位。今年我国工业总产值将差不多等于沙俄时代1913年工业总产值的四十倍，比苏联在战前的1940年的工业产值将增加四点七倍。苏联的农业也以高速度发展着。1958年我国农业总产值比沙俄时代的1913年增加二点二倍。”
    米高扬接着援引了许多数字，说明苏联在文化、教育、生活福利等方面的发展情况。他说，“对于苏联政府来说，没有比更充分全面地满足每一个苏联人的物质需求，更深刻的关心了。”
    米高扬说：“人们应该记住，我们并不剥削殖民地；我们在其他国家没有租借地——外国大垄断企业从这些租借地掠夺了难以想像的巨额利润。这样的财源和我们的世界观没有相同之处。”
    米高扬接着说，“苏联人民深信，在同美国的和平经济竞赛中，他们一定能够获得胜利，从而证明社会主义经济制度的无可比拟的优越性。”
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社墨西哥城21日讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬20日晚在“阿巴斯托”屠宰冷藏联合公司为他举行的宴会上发表讲话。米高扬指出，苏联在物质生产方面正在赶上并超过美国，而在文化和科学技术方面早 已超过美国。他说，苏联在这个学年毕业的单是具有高等教育程度的工程师就有十一万九千人，这个数字为美国的三倍半。而在人造地球卫星方面，苏联的人造地球卫星比美国更早的进入宇宙。在这些方面我们没有什么要赶的，而让他们赶我们吧。我当然不主张他们在战斗的洲际火箭方面赶上我们，因为我们希望把我们的和他们的全部军备都销毁。
    米高扬说，在物质生产量上，我们诚然还落后于美国，但是我们现在已经正在迅速地追赶着美国。我们的脚步是这样大，以至美国国会多次讨论我们在什么时候赶上他们的问题。为什么他们这样关心我们赶上和超过他们这件事呢？我们这样做并不靠他们，而是靠自己、靠自己的劳动。为什么他们过去可以赶过英国和法国，而我们苏联现在却不可以赶上和超过美国呢？谁给了美国永远走在前面的权利？我认为总有一天，墨西哥人也会给自己提出这种任务。
    米高扬最后说，苏维埃国家的政策是：排除战争作为解决国际问题的手段，消灭冷战，在各国人民之间建立更大的信任，互相尊重，互不干涉别国内政。让我们展开和平竞赛吧。
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社墨西哥城22日讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬22日开始在墨西哥作为期四天的访问旅行。
