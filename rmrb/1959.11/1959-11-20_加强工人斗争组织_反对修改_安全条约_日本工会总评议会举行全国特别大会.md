Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: The 13th National Extraordinary Convention of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan ("Sohyo") was held in Tokyo today. More than 1,300 workers participated in the convention, including 597 representatives from 57 industrial unions.

The convention was held under the slogan: "Let us direct the spearhead of the people's struggle against the revision of the Security Treaty and all the devastating consequences caused by the Security Treaty."

Ota Kaoru, Chairman of "Sohyo," said in his speech to the representatives that the "Sohyo" special meeting was convened to strengthen the workers' struggle organization to oppose the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," oppose mass layoffs of miners, and defend workers' rights. He emphasized that the convention should encourage and support the struggle of all Japanese people against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Ota Kaoru said, "Thanks to the efforts of socialist countries, the trend of peaceful coexistence is developing increasingly in the world." "Due to recent changes in the world situation, the internal contradictions of reactionary forces are deepening." Ota Kaoru pointed out: "This is beneficial for workers to strike at the struggle of reactionaries." Ota Kaoru emphasized, "As long as we strengthen the unity of our ranks and fight bravely, we can win victory in the battle."

Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of "Sohyo," put forward suggestions for "Sohyo's" action plan.

He said that the Kishi Nobusuke government is stepping up its activities to revise the "Security Treaty." "However, it should be considered that this shows that they are isolated in the world trend of striving for peace and are afraid of the strong struggle of democratic groups against their reactionary attempts."

Iwai Akira suggested that all non-governmental sector unions hold a twenty-four-hour strike during the eighth and ninth national unified actions scheduled for around the 27th of this month and December 10th. He also requested in his suggestion that government sector unions prepare to carry out strong struggles with non-governmental sector unions in these situations.

He asked all workers to prepare for a general strike during this period.

According to Iwai Akira's suggestion, the tenth national unified action to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" will be held around December 20th. He suggested that affiliated unions begin preparing for the tenth national unified action.

He emphasized the need to support the struggle of coal miners against mass layoffs. He said, "If the struggle of coal miners is victorious, then the government and the monopoly capitalists' attempt to undermine the trade union movement will suffer a serious setback."

Referring to the struggle of unemployed workers, he pointed out that the unemployed, including laid-off coal miners, are victims of economic and political measures that are coordinated with the conspiracy to revise the "Security Treaty." He said that workers should oppose the practice of giving priority to military spending in the national budget, and all workers should strengthen the struggle for full employment.

Finally, he put forward suggestions on "Sohyo's" spring struggle next year. He suggested that the main goals of the spring struggle are to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," normalize diplomatic relations between Japan and China, greatly increase wages, establish a minimum wage system, shorten working hours, and approve Article 87 of the International Labor Organization treaty guaranteeing workers' freedom of association.

Also speaking at the meeting were Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, Suzuki Ichizo, member of the Presidium of the Japan Communist Party, and Kato Kanju, representative of the National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." They all expressed their determination to fight together with the workers of "Sohyo" against the revision of the "Security Treaty." The convention is scheduled to last for two days.

    加强工人斗争组织　反对修改“安全条约”
    日本工会总评议会举行全国特别大会
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会（“总评”）第十三次全国特别大会今天在东京举行。参加大会的有一千三百多名工人，其中包括五十七个产业工会的五百九十七名代表。
    大会是在“让我们把人民斗争的矛头针对着修改安全条约和安全条约所造成的一切毁灭性的后果”的口号下进行的。
    “总评”议长太田熏在向代表们讲话时说，召开“总评”特别会议是为了加强工人的斗争组织，来反对修改日美“安全条约”、反对大批解雇矿工和保卫工人的权利。他强调说，大会应当鼓励和支持全体日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    太田熏说：“由于社会主义国家的努力，在世界上和平共处的趋势日益发展。”“由于最近世界局势的变化，反动势力的内部矛盾正在加深。”太田熏指出：“这对于工人打击反动派的斗争有利。”太田熏强调说，“只要我们加强队伍的团结和英勇斗争，我们就能在战斗中获得胜利。”
    “总评”事务局长岩井章提出了“总评”的行动方针的建议。
    他说，岸信介政府正在加紧进行修改“安全条约”的活动。“但是，应该认为，这一点表明，他们在争取和平的世界趋势中陷于孤立，并且害怕民主团体为反对他们的反动企图而进行的强有力的斗争。”
    岩井章建议所有非政府部门的工会在订于本月27日和12月10日左右展开的第八次和第九次全国统一行动时举行二十四小时罢工。他在建议中还要求政府部门的工会准备在这些情况下和非政府部门的工会一起进行强有力的斗争。
    他要求全体工人在这段时间内准备举行总罢工。
    根据岩井章的建议，第十次阻止修改“安全条约”全国统一行动将在12月20日左右举行。他建议所属工会开始为第十次全国统一行动进行准备。
    他着重指出，需要支持煤矿工人反对大批解雇的斗争。他说，“如果煤矿工人的斗争取得胜利，那末政府和垄断资本家想破坏工会运动的企图将遭受严重的挫折”。
    他在谈到失业工人的斗争时指出，包括被解雇的煤矿工人在内的失业者，是同修改“安全条约”阴谋相配合的经济和政治措施的牺牲品。他说，工人应当反对在国家预算中给予军事开支以优先权的做法，全体工人应当加强争取充分就业的斗争。
    他最后就“总评”明年的春季斗争提出了建议。他建议，春季斗争的主要目标是废除日美“安全条约”，使日中两国外交关系正常化，大大增加工资，建立最低工资制度，缩短工作时间和批准国际劳工组织条约中保障工人结社自由的第八十七条。
    在会上讲话的还有：日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎，日本共产党干部会委员铃木市藏以及阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议代表加藤勘十。他们都表示决心同“总评”的工人一道为反对修改“安全条约”而斗争。大会预定举行两天。
