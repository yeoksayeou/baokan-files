    Maintenance and Upkeep at Home, Vehicles are Often in Good Condition
    Beijing Transportation Company Regularly and Comprehensively Overfulfills Transportation Plans

    (Our report) The Beijing Transportation Company mobilized the masses to establish and improve vehicle management responsibility systems and driving operation procedures, and strengthened the technical management of vehicle maintenance and upkeep, raising the vehicle availability rate from 76.6% to 95.34%. For two years, this company, despite having a large volume of transport and few means of transport, has achieved safety, fuel efficiency, and comprehensive overfulfillment of transportation plans every month, except for July of this year due to excessive rain.

    The eleven motor vehicle depots under this company have more than 1,800 vehicles, one-third of which are old vehicles around twenty years old. At the beginning of last year, in the face of a sharp increase in transport volume, some leaders of this company neglected vehicle maintenance and upkeep, resulting in many vehicles experiencing mechanical failures due to not being repaired in time. At that time, only seventy-six and a half out of every hundred vehicles were able to participate in transportation, seriously affecting the completion of the transportation plan.

    The consequences of neglecting vehicle maintenance and upkeep made the leaders of this company pay attention to this issue. After discussion, they clearly realized that in the situation of few vehicles and many goods, in addition to doing everything possible to improve transportation efficiency, they must also do a good job in vehicle maintenance and upkeep to fully utilize the role of each vehicle in order to ensure high quality and high output. After this, this company simultaneously deployed and inspected maintenance and upkeep work when deploying tasks and inspecting production. When carrying out various competitions, they also included vehicle maintenance and the absence of mechanical accidents as a content of evaluation. They also mobilized the masses to establish a complete set of systems for vehicle maintenance and upkeep from the bottom up, and regularly educated drivers to cherish vehicles, so that the good car rate gradually rose to the advanced level in the country.

    The main experience of Beijing Transportation Company in improving the good car rate is to simultaneously emphasize prevention and overhaul, with prevention as the primary focus. Since the beginning of this year, this company has carried out two vehicle safety maintenance campaigns, conducting general inspections of vehicles and treating problems as early as possible. The larger one was the "Vehicle Overhaul Battle" carried out in late August. The company organized a special inspection team to cooperate with various motor vehicle depots, using all opportunities for vehicles to leave and return to the depot and during maintenance, to inspect and appraise all vehicles one by one, find out the damaged parts of the vehicles, and then arrange the repair procedures according to the degree of severity. Within forty days, a total of 1,379 vehicles and 1,003 trailers were overhauled. After this overhaul, the transportation efficiency was greatly improved. In October after the overhaul, the freight volume increased by 46% compared with before the overhaul. According to the company's preliminary calculations, if the good car rate in the fourth quarter of this year remains at the 95.34% level in October, it will transport 2.06 million tons more goods than in the third quarter, which is equivalent to adding 690,000 vehicle trips.

    In addition to generally carrying out preventive overhaul of vehicles, various motor vehicle depots mainly took three measures in daily maintenance and upkeep work:

    First, standardized driving. The driving methods such as "driving at medium speed, safe gliding, mastering temperature, and preheating the cylinder" are promoted among drivers. This method can not only extend the service life of parts and tires, but also ensure driving safety and save fuel. Now, drivers have eliminated the phenomenon of not cherishing vehicles by "ignoring small pits, closing their eyes to big pits, and running and bumping violently."

    Second, systemized maintenance. Various motor vehicle depots have formulated maintenance specifications and standards and systems for dedicated personnel and vehicles to maintain locomotives, trailers, etc. Vehicles that have reached the scheduled maintenance time insist on being repaired on time. It is also stipulated that drivers must perform various routine maintenance at any time before driving, during driving, and after returning to the depot, so as to "treat small illnesses" as soon as they appear. The Qinghe Motor Vehicle Depot stipulates that the vehicle depot leaders, the vehicle team leader, and the inspectors check the various parts of the vehicles at the gate when the vehicles leave and enter the depot every day. If any parts are found to be faulty, they are only allowed to leave the depot after they are repaired. Every two days, the inspectors also patrol the lines once, and if any problems are found, they immediately ask the driver to stop and repair the vehicle, so that the departure rate is often maintained at 98.25%, and there has never been a major mechanical accident.

    Third, specialized repair. Various motor vehicle depots have implemented the method of repairing vehicles according to vehicle brand, which greatly shortens the repair time and improves the repair quality.

    After the Beijing Transportation Company strengthened vehicle maintenance and upkeep, it not only improved the vehicle availability rate, but also achieved great results in saving fuel and safe driving. In the first ten months of this year, it has saved more than 12 million liters of gasoline and diesel, and the fuel consumption rate per kilometer has been reduced by 8.7% compared with the quota. In terms of safe driving, traffic accidents caused by malfunctioning parts have basically been eliminated.

    维修保养到家  车辆经常完好
    北京市运输公司经常全面超额完成运输计划
    本报讯　北京市运输公司发动群众建立健全车辆管理责任制度和驾驶操作规程，加强车辆维修、保养的技术管理工作，使车辆的完好率从76.6％提高到95.34％。两年来，这个公司在运量大、运输工具少的情况下，除了今年7月因雨多没有完成计划外，月月做到了安全、节油，全面地超额完成运输计划。
    这个公司所属的十一个汽车场，共有一千八百多辆汽车，其中有三分之一是二十年左右的旧车。去年年初，在运量猛增的形势下，这个公司有的领导人员忽视车辆的维修和保养工作，结果许多车辆由于没有及时修理，常常发生机械事故。当时，每一百部汽车中，只有七十六部半能够参加运输，严重地影响了运输计划的完成。
    忽视车辆维修、保养引起的后果，使这个公司的领导人员重视了这个问题。经过讨论，他们明确认识到在车少货多的情况下，除了千方百计提高运输效率外，还必须做好车辆的维修保养工作，充分发挥每部汽车的作用，才能保证优质高产。在这以后，这个公司在布置任务、检查生产的时候，都同时布置和检查维修、保养工作。在开展各种竞赛时，也都把车辆保养、不发生机械事故，作为评比的一项内容。他们还发动群众自下而上地建立一整套维修、保养车辆的制度，经常向司机进行爱护车辆的教育，使完好车率逐月上升到全国的先进水平。
    北京市运输公司提高完好车率的主要经验，是预防和检修同时并重，而以预防为主。今年以来，这个公司已经开展了两次车辆安全保养运动，对车辆普遍进行检查，发现毛病做到及早医治。规模较大的一次是在8月下旬进行的“整车战役”，公司组织专门检查组配合各汽车场，利用汽车出场、回场和保修中的一切机会，对所有车辆逐一进行检查、鉴定，摸清汽车的损坏部分，然后按照轻重缓急排定整修程序。四十天内，总共整修了一千三百七十九辆汽车、一千零三辆挂车。经过这次整修以后，大大提高了运输效率，整修后的10月份，货运量就比整修前增加了46％。据这个公司初步计算，今年第四季度的完好车率如果保持在10月份95.34％的水平，就能比第三季度多运二百零六万吨物资，等于增加六十九万辆车运送一次。
    除了普遍地对车辆进行预防整修外，各个车场在日常的维修和保养工作中，主要采取了三项措施：
    第一，驾驶标准化。在司机中推行“中速行车，安全滑行，掌握温度，预热温缸”等项驾驶方法。这种方法既能延长机件和轮胎的使用寿命，又保证了行车安全，节约了燃料。现在，司机们开车已经消灭了“小坑不管，大坑闭眼，猛跑猛颠”不爱护车辆的现象。
    第二，保养制度化。各个车场都已制订了保养规范标准和专人专车保养机车、拖车等制度，到了预定检修时间的车辆，坚持到时修理。并且规定司机必须在出车前、行驶中、回场后，随时进行各种例行保养，做到“小病”一露头，就及时医治。清河汽车场规定在每天汽车出场、入场时，由车场领导、车队长和检验员在门口检查车辆各部机件，发现机件有病，修好以后才准出车。每隔两天，检验员还在线路上巡回检查一次，发现问题，就立即要司机停车修理，使出车率经常保持在98.25％，从来没有发生过较大的机械事故。
    第三，修理专业化。各个车场都已实行按车辆厂牌分工修理的方法，大大缩短了修理时间，提高了修理质量。
    北京市运输公司加强车辆的维修、保养工作以后，不仅提高了车辆的完好率，而且在节约燃料和安全行车方面也取得了很大的成绩。今年头十个月，已经节约了一千二百多万公升汽油和柴油，每公里耗油率比定额降低了8.7％。在安全行车方面，基本上已经消灭了因机件不灵而发生的行车事故。
