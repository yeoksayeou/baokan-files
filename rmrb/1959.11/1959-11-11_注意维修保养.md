    Pay Attention to Maintenance
    Paying attention both to maximizing the utilization rate of machinery and equipment, and to the maintenance and repair of machinery and equipment, is a problem that should be constantly addressed to ensure sustained leaps forward in production.
    Workers say that machines "understand human feelings." If you treat them well, they will treat you well. In order to keep machines "energetic" and continuously serving the production leap forward, one cannot only focus on using them, but also pay attention to maintenance. Because, we are not only leaping forward today, but we must continue to leap forward continuously. Only by ensuring the normal and safe operation of machinery and equipment can we guarantee the continuous progress of production and continuous leaps forward. The practice of the Beijing Crane Factory in paying attention to the maintenance of machinery and equipment is worthy of attention.

    注意维修保养
    既要注意发挥机器设备的利用率，又要注意机器设备的保养和维修，这是保证生产持续跃进应该经常注意的问题。
    工人们说，机器是“懂人情”的，你对它好，它才能对你好。为了使机器“精力充沛”，持续不断地为生产跃进服务，就不能只顾使用，而且要注意维修保养。因为，我们不仅今天跃进，而且要继续不断地跃进。只有做到了机器设备的正常安全运转，才能保证生产连续不断地进行，连续跃进。北京起重机厂注意维护机器设备的作法是值得重视的。
