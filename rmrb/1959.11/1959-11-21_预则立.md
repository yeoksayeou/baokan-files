    Preparedness Ensures Success
    A key issue for transportation departments to improve vehicle utilization rates lies in strengthening vehicle maintenance. If vehicle maintenance work is done well, it can maintain the normal operation of vehicles and ensure the overfulfillment of transportation plans. The Beijing Transportation Company's vehicle integrity rate increased from 76.6% two years ago to 95.34%, achieving safe, economical, and comprehensive overfulfillment of transportation plans, which is a very good example.
    To do a good job in vehicle maintenance, prevention and repair must be given equal importance, with emphasis on prevention. Because in the process of transportation, there are often minor problems between various parts of the vehicle. If we maintain them diligently, discover small problems as soon as they appear, and eliminate them immediately, major failures will not occur and affect transportation. This is just like people in daily life, having minor ailments such as colds and indigestion. If prevention is done well, it can be avoided; even if a minor ailment is contracted, if treated early, it will not develop into a major illness.
    As the saying goes: "Preparedness ensures success, lack of preparation leads to failure." This is true for vehicle maintenance, and it is true for all other work.

    预则立
    运输部门提高出车率的关键问题，在于加强车辆的维修保养。车辆的维修保养工作做得好，可以保持车辆的正常运转，保证运输计划的超额完成。北京市运输公司车辆完好率从两年前的76.6％提高到95.34％，做到了安全、节约全面地超额完成运输计划，就是一个很好的例子。
    做好车辆维修保养工作，必须预防、检修同时并重，并且强调预防为主。因为车辆在运输过程中，各个部件之间常会出点小毛病，如果勤加维护，发现小毛病一露头，就马上治理，把它消灭，就不致发生大故障影响运输。这正好像人们在日常生活中，闹点伤风感冒和消化不良等小毛病一样，如果预防得好，就能避免；即使感染点小毛病，如果及早医治，也不会发展成大毛病。
    俗语说：凡事预则立，不预则废。车辆维修保养工作是如此，其他一切工作都是如此。
