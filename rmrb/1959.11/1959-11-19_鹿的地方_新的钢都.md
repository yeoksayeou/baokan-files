The old Baotou is dead, fading into people's memories: on the banks of the Yellow River at the foot of the Yin Mountains, the pasture is lush, and the sound of the Qiang flute is faint; the age-old Zhuanlong Temple has several ancient trees and a clear spring. Herds of deer from the Daqing Mountains lingered here, drinking water by the spring. When Mongolian herders from the Ulanqab League, the Ikh Juu League, and the Tumet Banner passed through here on horseback, they exclaimed to each other: "Ah! Bogh Tolgoi!" And so it became its name. Baotou, also called Bogh Tolgoi, means "Place of the Deer."

The old Baotou is dead, leaving only an imprint in people's memories: an earthen city wall, a stinking ditch, surrounding two rows of mud houses and dilapidated tile-roofed houses. On the ancient road in the western wind and sunset, camels slowly strode, bringing the heat and fatigue of the desert; the lonely camel bells told of the desolation of the frontier. Every night, the whole city was plunged into darkness, with only a dozen dim streetlights illuminating the narrow streets; in the deep alleys, a sickening, decadent tune drifted out, as landlords and merchants squandered the money they had exploited, living a dissolute and shameless life. In the moonlight, bold bandits roamed around robbing.... The Kuomintang reactionaries had repeatedly shouted slogans such as "Develop the Northwest" and "Build the Northwest," but the result was a few more land reclamation companies owned by bureaucratic landlords, and a few more fur and grain shops that exploited Mongolian and Han farmers and herders. In addition, there were three more "manys": many bandits, many opium addicts, and many prostitutes. This was their so-called "development"!

The old Baotou is dead. On the boundless grassland, like a dazzling red sun, a new Baotou has emerged.

September 19th of this year was the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Baotou, the birthday of the new Baotou. Ten years is only a moment in infinite time, but in our era of constant miracles, what earth-shattering changes have taken place! In ten years, from nothing, a large steel capital has risen on the Inner Mongolian grassland.

Today, when you take a bus from the Donghe District and travel on a smooth and wide asphalt road, the tall poplar trees by the road flash past the bus window, and the green fields stretch all the way to the Daqing Mountains. In the distance, beside the mountains, a cluster of blue-brick buildings with chimneys sprouting black peony flowers, gently trembling in the wind, is the small village formerly known as Gou Lan Ge Ba, which has now developed into the Qingshan District with its rows of high-rise buildings and factories. Here, the machinery industry has borne rich fruit. Further on, further on, ahead is the Kundulun District, the heart of the steel city—Baogang!

Baogang, a resonant and brilliant name! Baogang, like a magnet, attracts the hearts of countless young builders! On Steel Avenue, you can hear all kinds of accents, Wu dialect with imperfect Mandarin, heroes from Anshan whose pronunciation of "ren" (person) sounds like "yin," and Mongolian, Daur, and Korean languages that you may not understand but feel familiar and pleasant... They come from the places where lychees bear fruit, from the places where cattle and sheep gather in herds, from the places where ice seals thousands of miles, from every piece of land in the vast territory of the motherland. These people, precisely these people, under the leadership of the Party, with the help of Soviet experts and the support of the people of the whole country, with a common desire, gathered into an indestructible and strong vanguard, to wage war on the desert! To wage war on the Yellow River! To wage war on the sandstorms! With a high speed of four or five years, Baogang was built to an initial scale. What a difficult and glorious journey this has been! The builders of Baogang will firmly remember the first red flag of the exploration team in the spring sandstorm, those who pitched their tents among the Zojiji flowers and lizard burrows and first forged the way; they will also remember the Soviet experts who traveled and surveyed in the scorching sun and rain. In one survey, comrades found that Comrade Terekhov, a Soviet expert, had difficulty walking. They asked him and learned that his leg had been injured in the Great Patriotic War, and now the wound had become inflamed due to overwork. Comrades advised him to rest, but the expert smiled and repeatedly said, "It's okay! It's okay!" People also remember the old herdsman who came from the Ulanqab grassland, who insisted on dedicating his most precious daughter, the apple of his eye, to the construction of Baogang, eagerly hoping that she could quickly become the first generation of glorious steelworkers on the grassland. People also remember the unforgettable twenty-two and a half hours of pouring the foundation of the No. 1 blast furnace, when the workers created a national record for foundation pouring with their outstanding labor. People also remember the two youth steel shock brigades, who spent just over nine days installing three giant hot blast stoves, breaking the national record for rapid construction; Liu Zhixiang, a technical innovation expert and Communist Party member, spent countless sleepless nights reviving waste oil, reviving eccentric shafts, and solving various key problems in production.... Ah! There are endless touching deeds, deeply imprinted in our minds! There are endless hymns that spontaneously burst forth from our hearts!

Crossing the Kundulun River and arriving at the Baogang construction site, as far as the eye can see, there are countless scaffolds, countless bright and spacious factory buildings, and countless towering chimneys. However, all of this seems to surround the giant that strikingly catches your eye—the magnificent furnace body of the world-class Baogang No. 1 blast furnace. On the eve of iron tapping, the blast furnace site is particularly tense. All the preparations are complete: the miners have selected the best coal for it; the No. 3 and No. 4 coke ovens of the coking plant are burning fiercely and spewing thick smoke, cooking delicacies for it; a 150-kilometer railway extending north from the foot of the Wula Mountains leads directly to the Baiyun Obo treasure mountain, where the largest crushing plant in the country has also prepared fine grains for it; the first water supply project has brought it palatable beverages. Everything is ready, and the east wind of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, which opposed rightward tendencies and encouraged greater efforts, is blowing hard. The workers took advantage of the momentum to overcome the iron tapping barrier and, on the eve of National Day, used the torrent of molten iron to write a message of victory to the Party and Chairman Mao on the green note paper of the grassland.

Iron is tapped! This huge black thing spews red waves; pushing out a round of brilliant red sun, this is the dawn of a new day; this is the beginning of a glorious journey; the history of the steel city has opened a new page; a brave and fierce general has been added to the steel front of the motherland. It is estimated that the iron produced by this blast furnace in one day and night can be used to manufacture 110,000 double-wheeled double-share plows or more than 1,000 small tractors. The iron it produces in ten days can be made into steel rails to lay a railway from Jining to Erenhot, a total length of 338 li. What an amazing number!

Iron is tapped! The steel city is boiling! The wide and beautiful Steel Avenue is decorated in colorful colors, welcoming distinguished guests from all over the country. On that unforgettable carnival night, the festive drums knocked out the joyous feelings of the people of Baotou, and the splashing fireworks symbolized the unrestrained emotions of the people of Baotou. On Steel Avenue, where the crowds were surging, joyful dance music was swirling. The eternally silent Wula Mountains seemed to sing and dance with the people... Then, another good news deeply moved everyone: Premier Zhou Enlai brought the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and cut the ribbon for the iron tapping of the blast furnace. The people of Baotou were extremely excited and determined to respond to the concern of the Party and Chairman Mao with greater leaps forward and new achievements.

Iron is tapped! When Mongolian herders from the Ulanqab League, the Ikh Juu League, and the Tumet Banner came to Baogang, they exclaimed to each other: "Ah! Our Bogh Tolgoi (Place of the Deer) has become Bogh Tolgoitai (Place of Steel)!"

From Bogh Tolgoi to Bogh Tolgoitai, from the Place of the Deer to the new steel capital, this entire high-speed transformation is a magnificent epic that praises the greatness of the Party and the bravery and diligence of the Chinese people, and it praises the great strength of our young republic. The history of Baotou's transformation is a ironclad proof of the victory of the Party's general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the Party's ethnic policy.

    鹿的地方——新的钢都
    许淇
    旧的包头死去了，湮没在人们的记忆中：阴山之麓的黄河岸上，牧草萋萋，羌管幽幽；年代久远的转龙藏，有古木数枝，清泉一注。大青山附近的鹿群徘徊在这里，在泉边饮水。乌兰察布盟、伊克昭盟和土默特旗的蒙族牧民骑马经过这里时，都相互惊叹着说：“呵！包克图！”于是这就成了它的名字。包头，又叫包克图，意思是“鹿的地方”。
    旧的包头死去了，只在人们的记忆中留着印痕：一堵土城墙，一道臭水沟，围绕着两排土屋和破败欲倾的瓦房。西风夕阳古道上，骆驼慢悠悠地跨着阔步，带来了沙漠的灸热和疲乏；寂寞驼铃，诉说着塞上的荒凉。每当夜晚，整个城市沉没在黑暗中，只有十几盏半明不亮的路灯，照着狭小的街道；在深巷里，传出令人作呕的靡靡之音，地主商人正把他们剥削来的金钱在那里挥霍，过着荒淫无耻的生活。月影里，大胆的土匪到处乱窜抢劫……。国民党反动派曾经口口声声高喊过“开发西北”、“建设西北”，结果是这里多了几个官僚地主的屯垦公司，多了几家剥削蒙汉农牧民的皮毛粮店。此外还有三多是：土匪多，大烟鬼多，娼妓多。这就是他们的所谓“开发”！
    旧的包头死去了。在一望无边的草原上，像绚红的太阳，出现了新的包头。
    今年9月19日，是包头解放十周年纪念日，是新包头的生日。十年，在无限的时间里只是一瞬，然而，在我们这不断出现奇迹的时代，却有着多么惊天动地的变化！十年，从无到有，一座大型的钢都矗立在内蒙古草原上了。
    如今，当你乘着公共汽车从东河区出发，行驶在一条平滑宽广的柏油路上时，路旁高大的杨树在车窗口飞快地掠过去，绿色的原野，一直伸向大青山。在前方，傍着山岭，一片青砖的楼房的烟囱上开着一朵朵黑牡丹，临风轻颤，这便是昔日称为沟兰圪巴的小村子，现在已发展成高楼毗连，工厂棋布的青山区。这里，机械工业已结出了丰硕的果实。往前去，再往前去，前面是昆都仑区，是钢城的心脏——包钢！
    包钢，响亮光彩的名字！包钢，像一块磁石，吸引住多少青年建设者的心灵！在钢铁大街上，你能听到各种各样的口音，有普通话说得不高明的吴侬软语，有鞍山来的好汉，他们“人”的发音如“银”，有你听不懂但却觉得亲切悦耳的蒙古话、达斡尔话、朝鲜话……他们来自荔枝结果的地方，来自牛羊成群的地方，来自千里冰封的地方，来自祖国辽阔的幅员的每一块土地。这些人，就是这些人，在党的领导下，在苏联专家的帮助和全国人民的支援下，怀着一个共同的愿望，聚集成无坚不摧的强固尖兵，向沙漠开战！向黄河开战！向暴风沙开战！以四、五年的高速度，初具规模地建起了包钢。这其间，有着何等艰巨而光辉的历程啊！包钢的建设者会牢牢地记念着，那春天的风砂里的第一面勘探队的红旗，那些把帐篷扎在酒盅盅花和蜥蜴的沙窝间、首先踏出路来的人们；也会记得那些在烈日和风雨中奔波踏勘的苏联专家。在一次踏勘中，同志们发现专家捷列基也夫同志走路时很吃力，一问才知道他的腿在卫国战争中受过伤，现在因为过度疲劳，伤口又发炎了。同志们劝他休息，专家却微笑着连连说：“没关系！没关系！”人们也还记得那从乌兰察布草原上前来的老牧民，他定要把自己的掌上明珠——最宝贝的女儿，献给包钢的建设，殷切地期望着她能迅速成为草原上第一代光荣的钢铁工人。人们也还记得，一号高炉基础浇灌的难忘的二十二个半小时，工人们以出色的劳动创造了那时基础浇灌的全国纪录。人们也还记得两个青年钢铁突击队，用九天多的时间，安装了三座巨型的热风炉，打破了全国快速施工的最高纪录；技术革新能手、共产党员刘志祥，为了复活废油、复活扁心轴，为了解决生产中的各种关键，度过无数个不眠之夜……啊！有说不完的动人事迹，深印在我们脑海！有唱不完的赞歌，情不自禁地吐露自我们 的心胸！
    跨过昆都仑河，来到包钢工地，目光所及之处，是数不清的脚手架，数不清的敞亮的大厂房，数不清的高耸的烟囱。然而这一切，又好像众星拱月般地围绕着那赫然映入你眼帘的巨人——世界第一流的包钢一号高炉雄伟的炉体。面临着出铁的前夕，高炉工地格外紧张。所有的准备工作都已经停当：矿工们为它挑选出上好的煤炭；焦化厂三号和四号焦炉火焰熊熊、浓烟喷射，为它烧熟了佳肴；从乌拉山麓向北延伸的一条一百五十公里的铁路，直达白云鄂博宝山，在那里，全国最大的破碎厂也为它备下了细粮；第一供水工程已经为它引来了可口的饮料。万事齐备，党中央八届八中全会反右倾、鼓干劲的东风劲吹，工人们乘势攻克了出铁大关，在国庆前夕用铁水的洪流在草原的绿笺上，给党和毛主席写下了报捷信。
    出铁了！这个庞大的黑家伙喷吐红浪；推出了一轮绚红的朝阳，这是一个新的一天的黎明；这是一个辉煌历程的开始；钢城的历史从此掀开了新的篇页；祖国的钢铁阵线上从此添了一员勇猛的骁将。这座高炉，估计它一昼夜生产的铁，可以制造十一万部双轮双铧犁或一千多台小型拖拉机。把它十天内出的铁制成钢轨，可以铺设一条全长三百三十八里的集宁到二连的铁路，这是多么惊人的数字啊！
    出铁了！钢城沸腾了！宽阔美丽的钢铁大街，打扮得五彩缤纷，迎接来自全国各地的贵宾。在那难忘的狂欢之夜里，节庆的锣鼓敲出了包头人喜悦的心意，飞溅的礼花，象征着包头人奔放的感情。人潮汹涌的钢铁大街上，欢乐的舞曲在回旋。千古寂默的乌拉山也仿佛和人们一起歌唱舞蹈了……。接着，另一个喜讯又深深地感动着每个人；周恩来总理带来了党中央和毛主席的指示，并且还为高炉出铁剪彩。包头人民万分激动，决心以更大的跃进和新的成绩来回答党和毛主席的关怀。
    出铁了！乌盟、伊盟、土默特旗的蒙族牧民来到包钢时，都相互惊叹着说：“呵！我们的包克图（鹿的地方）变成了包鲁特泰（钢的地方）了！”
    从包克图到包鲁特泰，从鹿的地方到新的钢都，这整个高速度的变迁是一部壮丽的史诗，它歌颂了党的伟大和中国人民的勇敢勤劳，它歌颂了我们年青的共和国的巨大力量。包头的变迁史，是党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进，党的民族政策的胜利的铁证。
