    Commune Members Talk About the Harvest
    What the Party Says, It Does
    Yin Qintian, Liaobu People's Commune, Dongguan, Guangdong
    This year's late rice crop is really growing well. I've lived for decades and never seen such a bumper harvest. Ah Hai (尹志海, Yin Zhihai, Branch Secretary of Huangjuyuan Brigade) often shouts to everyone: "Work harder, one crop should equal a year!" Of course, I don't want to lose to those youngsters, the days are short, so we make up for it at night. Speaking of how much the flood took away, and how much we got back, it's good, but I was always half-believing, half-doubting, wondering if Ah Hai was exaggerating. At that time, there was a lot of commotion about eliminating the third-class rice, applying fertilizer day and night, the momentum was really great. I thought the rice was already "old," what use would more fertilizer be? But who would listen to you! Wow, this time I was enlightened, more than a hundred acres of third-class rice, all "rejuvenated," yielding seven or eight hundred catties per mu, that's really something! Later, they said they wanted to develop thousand-catty mu, which is a good thing, of course I don't object, but I didn't really believe it. I thought, if you don't count the cost, it might not be difficult to get a thousand catties of rice from one and a half mu, but what's the use of that! This time I miscalculated again, come and see our high-yield fields, more than a hundred acres in a large area, all yielding more than a thousand catties per mu, and even more than five mu yielding one thousand three or four hundred catties! "Big talk is afraid of counting," now more than half has been actually harvested, it seems that our brigade is completely confident that the average yield of late rice this year will be eight hundred catties per mu, which is more than the two crops last year. What the Communist Party says, it does. I am completely convinced. In the future, I will definitely listen to the Party and make production even more prosperous!
    The Fundamental Guarantee of a Bumper Harvest
      Shuai Xige, Sanhu People's Commune, Xingan, Jiangxi
    Our entire commune has 20,112 mu of cotton fields, with a total output of 2,033,800 catties of ginned cotton, an average yield of more than 101 catties per mu. How did we get this bumper harvest? Strengthening the Party's leadership, constantly opposing right-leaning conservatism, and going all out, is the fundamental guarantee of a bumper harvest. In the early stages of cotton growth, due to the high amount of rainfall, 30% of the cotton seedlings became sick and died. At this time, a few people lacked confidence in striving for a bumper cotton harvest and advocated plowing them over and replanting. In response to this situation, the commune Party committee, from cadres to the masses, educated the masses by presenting facts, reasoning, and summarizing the vivid facts of the 1958 cotton bumper harvest, improving understanding, distinguishing right from wrong, and reversing pessimistic emotions. The commune Party committee also mobilized more than 3,000 veteran commune members throughout the commune to replant seedlings. After seven days of hard work, they finally ensured that all the seedlings were in the fields, achieving a bumper harvest.

    公社社员谈丰收
    党说到就做到
    广东东莞寮步人民公社　尹钦田
    今年晚稻实在长得好，活了几十岁还没有见过这样的特大丰收。阿海（黄菊园大队支部书记尹志海）这个人呀，常常冲着大伙喊：加油干啊，一造要顶一年。我当然也不输给那班后生仔，白天日头短，夜里来补足。说到洪水夺去多少，我们拿回多少，好是好，可心里还总是半信半疑，阿海会不会吹牛呢？那时候闹哄哄要消灭三类禾，日夜追肥，劲头确实大。我看禾都“老”了，追肥又顶什么用？可是有谁听你的话呢！吓，这回可开了眼界啦，百多亩三类禾，全部“返老还童”，亩产七、八百斤，真有那么一手！后来又说要大搞千斤亩，这是好事情嘛，我当然不反对，可心里也不那么相信。我想，如果不计成本，搞它一亩半亩千斤稻，也许不难，但这又有什么用场呢！这回我又失算了，你来瞧瞧我们的丰产田吧，百多亩一大片，都是亩产千斤以上的，甚至亩产一千三、四百斤的也有五亩多！“大话怕计数”，现在实割了一大半，看起来，我们大队今年晚稻平均亩产八百斤完全有把握，比较去年两造还要多。共产党说到就做到，我完全心服了。以后一定听党的话，把生产搞得更红火！
    丰收的根本保证
      江西新干三湖公社　帅细个
    我们全公社二万零一百一十二亩棉田，总产皮棉二百零三万三千八百多斤，平均亩产一百零一斤多。这丰收是怎么得来的？加强党的领导，不断反对右倾保守，鼓足干劲，是大丰收的根本保证。在棉花生长初期，由于雨量较多，30％的棉苗生病死亡。这时候，有少数人对争取棉花丰收缺乏信心，主张翻掉重种。公社党委针对这种情况，从干部到群众，通过摆事实、讲道理，总结1958年棉花丰收的生动事实，教育群众，提高认识，分清是非，扭转了悲观情绪。公社党委又在全公社内动员了三千多名老社员去补苗，经过七天的努力，终于保证了丘丘全苗，取得了大丰收。
