　　Relying on Military Orders and Economic Expansion to Stimulate Production
　　West Germany's Economy Remains Unstable in the First Half of the Year

　　(Reported by this newspaper) The "Bulletin of the German Economic Institute," published by the German Democratic Republic, published a commentary in its 17th issue, assessing the West German economy in the first half of 1959. The magazine pointed out that although West German industrial production increased by 4.8% compared with the same period last year, this slight growth still lacks a solid foundation. The development of the West German economy remains unstable and unbalanced.

　　The mining industry in West Germany remains full of crisis. In coal mining, the most important sector, mining volume decreased by 6.2% compared with the first half of last year, and hard coal production decreased by more than 3.6 million tons. More than 50,000 workers have been laid off by mine owners.

　　In West Germany's iron ore mining, production in the first half of 1959 decreased by 5.9%, and in metal mining it even dropped by 12.8%.

　　The American steelworkers' strike benefited the West German steel industry and increased a large number of orders for it. Nevertheless, the steel industry's output was still 3.1% lower than in the first half of last year.

　　The machine manufacturing industry, except for May, never reached the corresponding monthly output of 1958.

　　Automobile manufacturing increased by 14% in the first half of 1959. The automobile manufacturing industry is an industrial sector that has largely been involved in military production. The shipbuilding industry also fell into a state of crisis in the first half of 1959, and it is feared that it has not yet reached its lowest point. Its output decreased by about 9%.

　　In the traditional consumer industrial sector, the situation has improved somewhat compared with the end of last year, but the difficulties have not been truly resolved. In the first half of 1959, textile industry output was 1.7% lower than in the first half of 1958. By the middle of this year, the number of employees in the textile and clothing industries alone had decreased by 80,000 from its peak.

　　The magazine said that if you compare the period from July 1958 to June 1959 with the same period in the previous year, according to the average industrial output of 1958, more than one-third of West German industrial sectors (where workers account for almost half) experienced a decline in output, and some experienced a sharp decline.

　　In analyzing the reasons for the growth of the West German economy in the first half of this year, the magazine pointed out that the first is the strengthening of the foreign trade offensive. The second is the increase in government spending, especially the increase in spending on military expansion and war preparation. Finally, there is unscrupulous speculation. All of this has made many West German economists extremely cautious when commenting on future development prospects.

    依靠军事订货和经济扩张刺激生产
    西德上半年经济依然不稳定
    本报讯　德意志民主共和国出版的“德意志经济研究所通报”第十七期登载了编辑部的一篇评论，评述了1959年上半年的西德经济。这家杂志指出，虽然今年上半年西德工业产量比去年同期增加4.8％，但是这微小的增长至今还毫无巩固的基础。西德经济的发展依然不稳定、不平衡。
    在西德的采矿业中仍旧充满了危机。在煤炭开采这个最重要的部门，开采量比去年上半年减少了6.2％，硬煤产量减少了三百六十多万吨。已经有五万多名工人被矿山老板解雇。
    在西德的铁矿开采方面，1959年上半年的生产量减少了5.9％，在金属采矿方面甚至下降了12.8％。
    美国钢铁工人罢工有利于西德钢铁工业，并给它增加了大批订货。尽管如此，钢铁工业的产量仍比去年上半年低3.1％。
    机器制造工业除掉5月以外，从没达到1958年相应的月产量。
    汽车制造业在1959年上半年增加了14％。汽车制造业是一个在很大程度上已被卷入军备生产的工业部门。造船工业在1959年上半年也陷入危机状态，而且恐怕还没有达到最低点。它的产量约下降了9％。
    在传统的消费工业部门中，与去年年底比较起来情况有些好转，但困难并没有真正解决。1959年上半年纺织工业产量比1958年上半年低1.7％。到今年年中，仅只纺织和服装工业部门的就业人数，就从其最高点减少了八万人。
    这家杂志说，如果把1958年7月到1959年6月与前一年同期比较一下，按照1958年工业平均产量来看，有三分之一以上的西德工业部门（那里工人几乎占了一半）产量下降，一部分产量急剧下降。
    在分析今年上半年西德经济增长的原因时，这家杂志指出首先是对外贸易攻势的加强。其次是国家支出增加，特别在扩军备战方面费用的增加。最后是肆无忌惮地投机。这一切使得西德许多经济学家在评论今后发展远景时，也不得不极为谨慎了。
