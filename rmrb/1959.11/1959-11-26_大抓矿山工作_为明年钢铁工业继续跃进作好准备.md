    Vigorously Grasp Mining Work, Prepare for the Continued Leap Forward of the Steel Industry Next Year

    In order to guarantee the continued leap forward in steel production next year, our province plans to equip iron mines, expand and rebuild mining sites, and increase the mechanization and semi-mechanization of mining and transportation in these iron mines, expanding mining capacity. This is a fundamental link in the development of steel production next year.

    Iron ore work is the foundation of the steel production leap forward. Every ton of pig iron produced requires three tons of ore. The iron mines in our province are all small mining sites, characterized by: manual labor, low production levels; generally only developing the topsoil near the ground, or open-pit mining, with limited production capacity; and, with the exception of a few mines, transportation conditions are not good enough. In order to meet the requirements of the huge growth in steel production, it is necessary to equip key iron mines and expand and rebuild mining sites as quickly as possible.

    There are two ways to build iron mines: one is to act according to "conventional" practices, waiting for foreign equipment and proceeding step by step; the other is to follow the example of the Chahuamiao Iron Mine, starting with indigenous methods, moving from indigenous to foreign, and mobilizing the masses to build mines quickly, well, and economically. The former is a manifestation of right-leaning thinking and a slow, inefficient, and costly path; the latter is a mass line approach and a high-speed path forward. We want to build regularized and modernized mines, but under the current production and equipment conditions, it is impossible to achieve this overnight; we can only move from indigenous to foreign. The practice of the Chahuamiao Iron Mine embodies this spirit and is the correct path to achieve modernization and mechanization under the current production and equipment conditions. According to the old method, it would take at least three years to build an iron mine like the Chahuamiao Iron Mine, but Chahuamiao completed this journey in just over ten months.

    Currently, various localities are actively preparing for steel production next year, and mining work should be ahead of the game. Because the construction process of mines is generally relatively long, and involves underground operations, as well as a series of issues such as exploration and design, this work must be firmly grasped from the beginning, act quickly, and seize every second to save time and produce more ore to refine more steel.

### 大抓矿山工作　为明年钢铁工业继续跃进作好准备

    大抓矿山工作　为明年钢铁工业继续跃进作好准备
    为了保证明年钢铁生产的继续跃进，我省计划装备铁矿，扩建和改建矿点，提高这些铁矿的采矿和运输的机械化和半机械化程度，扩大采矿能力。这是发展明年钢铁生产的基本环节。
    铁矿工作是钢铁生产跃进的基础。每增产一吨生铁，需要三吨矿石。我省现有的铁矿都是些小矿点，这些小矿点的特点是：手工作业，生产水平较低；一般只开发了离地面较近的表皮，或是露天开采，生产能力有限；除少数矿山以外，运输条件都不够好。为了满足钢铁生产巨大增长的要求，必须以最快的速度，装备好重点铁矿和扩建、改建矿点。
    建设铁矿有两种办法：一种是按“常规”办事，等待洋设备，按部就班地办事；另一种是按插花庙铁矿的办法，土法上马，由土到洋，发动群众多快好省地建设矿山。前一种是右倾思想的表现，是一条少慢差费的道路；后一种是群众路线的办法，是高速度前进的道路。我们要建设正规化和现代化的矿山，在现在的生产和设备条件下，不可能一蹴而就，只能由土到洋。插花庙铁矿的作法正体现了这个精神，是在现在的生产和设备条件下达到现代化、机械化的正确途径。按照旧的办法，建成一座像插花庙铁矿这样的铁矿，起码要三年时间，而插花庙却以十多个月的时间走完了这段路。
    现在，各地正在积极为明年钢铁生产作准备工作，矿山工作更应跑在前面。因为矿山的建设过程一般是比较长的，又是地下作业，还涉及到勘探、设计等一系列的问题，因此，这项工作一开始就要狠狠抓紧，迅速行动，争分抢秒，以便争取时间，多产矿石多炼钢铁。
