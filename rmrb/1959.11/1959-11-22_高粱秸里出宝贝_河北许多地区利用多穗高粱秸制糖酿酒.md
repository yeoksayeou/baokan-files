Treasures from Sorghum Stalks
Hebei Many Areas in Hebei Use Multi-Spike Sorghum Stalks to Make Sugar and Brew Wine

(Our newspaper, Tianjin, 21st dispatch) Many areas in Hebei Province have achieved remarkable results in using multi-spike sorghum stalks to extract sugar and brew wine.

According to the identification by Gaoyang County Chengguan Sugar Factory, every 100 jin of multi-spike sorghum stalks can produce more than 17 jin of maltose, which reduces the cost of making maltose by more than 70% compared with using grain. Every 100 jin of sorghum stalks can produce 4 jin of granulated sugar or more than 7 jin of 65-proof Baijiu. The taste of the wine is even better than that of sweet potato dried wine, and the cost is 35% lower than that of sweet potato dried wine. These products are normal in color and pure in taste, and are highly praised by customers. The residue after sugar production can also be made into machine-made paper, producing about 20 jin of single-sided glossy paper per 100 jin. The color is bright white and the quality is very good.

Gaoyang County vigorously promotes sugar production from multi-spike sorghum stalks. More than 6,000 people have mastered the sugar production technology. In just 20 days, 33,000 jin of maltose has been produced. The county plans to produce 14.12 million jin of maltose by the end of the year, and use the residue after sugar production to produce 106 tons of paper.

In Ningjin County, more than 30 wineries have been newly built and expanded in more than ten days, and more than 60,000 jin of Baijiu have been produced from multi-spike sorghum stalks.

According to incomplete statistics, as of the end of October, five counties and cities including Gaoyang, Ding County, Tang County, Xushui, and Baoding City have built 159 small earthen sugar factories, producing more than 1.09 million jin of maltose and more than 750,000 jin of Baijiu. In Tianjin, 107 small factories using multi-spike sorghum stalks to make sugar and wine have been put into production.

    高粱秸里出宝贝
    河北许多地区利用多穗高粱秸制糖酿酒
    本报天津21日电　河北省许多地区，利用多穗高粱秸榨糖、酿酒取得显著成绩。
    据高阳县城关糖厂鉴定，每百斤多穗高粱秸可以制出饴糖十七斤以上，比用粮食制饴糖成本降低70％以上，每百斤高粱秸可以出砂糖四斤，或六十五度的白酒七斤多，酒味比薯干酒还好，成本比薯干酒低35％。这些产品色泽正常、味道纯正，很受顾客赞美。制糖后的渣子，还可以制成机制纸，每百斤出二十斤左右单面有光纸，色泽光白，质量很好。
    高阳县大力推广多穗高粱秸制糖，已经有六千多人掌握了制糖技术，仅仅二十天的时间，就生产出饴糖三万三千斤，全县计划到年底，可生产饴糖一千四百十二万斤，利用制糖后的渣子制纸一百零六吨。
    宁津县十多天，就新建扩建了三十多个酒厂，用多穗高粱秸制成白酒六万多斤。
    据不完全统计，截至10月底止，高阳、定县、唐县、徐水、保定市等五个县、市，已经建起了小土群糖厂一百五十九个，已产饴糖一百零九万多斤，白酒七十五万多斤。天津市各县有一百零七处用多穗高粱秸制糖、制酒的小型工厂投入了生产。
