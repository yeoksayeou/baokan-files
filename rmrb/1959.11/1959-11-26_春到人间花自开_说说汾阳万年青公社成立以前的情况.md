    When Spring Comes to the World, Flowers Bloom
    – On the Situation Before the Establishment of the Fenyang Wannianqing Commune
    Ma Feng

    The Fenyang Wannianqing People's Commune in Shanxi was officially announced on August 26, 1958, with gongs and drums. However, in the months before that, although it wasn't called a people's commune, it was actually doing "that set of things" that people's communes do.
    To understand this, we must first talk about the vigorous water conservancy construction of the Pengbo Agricultural Cooperative in Jia Village Township.
    The Pengbo Agricultural Cooperative was an advanced cooperative formed by seven natural villages. The villages varied in size, wealth, and poverty. In 1957, the weather was unfavorable, and the dryland crops suffered reduced yields. Some members in the wealthier villages grumbled privately, believing they were "suffering losses by associating with the poorer villages." These rumors reached the ears of the members in the poorer villages, and who could feel comfortable hearing them? The situation escalated to the point where they wanted to split the cooperative.
    Liang Shixin, the secretary of the Jia Village Township Party Committee, resolutely opposed the split. He believed that splitting the cooperative would be a step backward. The fundamental problem was to build large-scale water conservancy projects to transform all dryland into irrigated land. To achieve this plan, it was necessary to continue running the cooperative. Actually, no one had openly proposed splitting the cooperative at that time; it was just being muttered in secret. Liang Shixin simply brought it into the open for everyone to discuss. After a major debate, everyone's thinking was elevated. Could building socialism be a step backward? Absolutely not, resolutely move forward!
          Success Depends on Human Effort
    This was precisely the winter of 1957, when agricultural Great Leap Forward movements were being carried out everywhere. Here, a surge of transforming dryland into paddy fields was also set off. In the previous two years, people had drilled eleven wells in those old drylands, each one a dark hole. There was no water underground; what could be done? There was one solution: use the well water from the west to irrigate the dryland in the east. The underground water source in the west was very abundant. There were already two hundred wells. The water from these wells alone could almost irrigate all 10,000+ mu of land in the entire cooperative. So, why hadn't they done this earlier? They had tried, but failed – the dryland was too far from the wells, the furthest being six kilometers away. Before the water could reach the fields, it would almost completely seep away in the canals. What could be done?
    The masses are wise. In those days, everyone in the cooperative put their minds to this matter, discussing it and studying it. Finally, they found a trick: building "three-earth" canals.
    The most important thing for building three-earth canals was to have lime. According to preliminary calculations, the total length of the four canals was twenty kilometers, requiring more than two million jin of lime. Where to buy so much lime? There were people in Beiguo and Beiguanyuan who had burned lime before, and there was plenty of bluestone in the Yumen River beach. Why buy it? Burn it themselves. Soon, a lime kiln was put into production.
    Bricks were needed to build the canal sluice gates, bricks were needed to build the well platforms, and bricks were needed to build the pot-camel engine rooms; small canals needed to be paved with large barrel tiles. Where to buy so many bricks and tiles? There was nowhere. There were adobe makers in Guxian Village and kiln workers in Caojia Village. Another brick and tile factory was put into production.
    Was it okay to build such a long canal without proper surveying? What to do? Improvise – find local experts. Some old men in the village who had grown vegetables all their lives, although they had never used a level, could tell which was high and which was low, whether the water could flow through, just by squatting on the edge of the field and looking. There were also some bricklayers and carpenters who couldn't live without plumb lines and levels all day long. Wouldn't it be very appropriate for these people to do surveying? So a surveying team began surveying.
    In the winter of 1957, materials were prepared; preparations were made. As soon as the ground thawed in the spring of 1958, a team of four hundred and fifty people began to build the canal. Liang Shixin and the cooperative cadres also personally took action and worked alongside the members. The first "three-earth" canal was quickly built. Water flowed down this canal, and everyone in the cooperative was thrilled. Some elderly people said with emotion: "What's flowing in the canal isn't water, it's grain! If it weren't for the Great Leap Forward, we wouldn't have been able to do it even in our dreams!" Even those who had resolutely advocated splitting the cooperative in the past said: "The cooperative really does have great strength. Such a large project, relying on one village and one cooperative, would definitely not be possible!"
    The three-earth canals closely linked the seven villages together.
      A Series of Problems
    The canal construction project continued, and the plan to turn all dryland into irrigated land was no longer a problem. However, in this way, even more problems were involved.
    What kind of problems were they? When the first three-earth canal was completed, it was precisely when the resolution of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China was announced. People's production enthusiasm was even higher, and their appetites were even greater – revising the Great Leap Forward targets: doubling on the basis of 1956, with an average yield of 576 jin per mu. The cooperative members said, "Let's just round it up! Strive to achieve 600 jin."
    Six hundred jin per mu, based on what? Is it okay to just have water without sufficient fertilizer? Fertilizer, this was really a big problem. Since the winter of 1957, a vigorous fertilizer accumulation campaign had been launched: collecting thatch, lining pens, digging stove ash, sweeping dirty soil..., after a winter of hard work, the accumulated manure and miscellaneous fertilizer only averaged 27 dan per mu. This was much more than in previous years, but the yield target had more than doubled. Was it okay not to increase fertilizer in large quantities? Other agricultural cooperatives were also worried about this. There were always ways people could think of. Workers at the Qingxu County Saltpeter Plant had researched a method for manufacturing local chemical fertilizer. The county industrial bureau sent people to learn, did experiments overnight, and the next day held an on-site meeting to impart experience and call on all cooperatives to make their own local chemical fertilizer. After the meeting, many agricultural cooperatives actively prepared to build local chemical fertilizer plants, and the Pengbo Cooperative was no different, immediately starting to do it. The tools used to make fertilizer, if one village didn't have them, another village did, and they were quickly put together. The cooperative really had great potential, and it was easy to get things done with more people. Before other cooperative local chemical fertilizer plants had been completed, the products here had already been made. Then, they organized a group to cultivate bacterial fertilizer, established a pig farm, and also mobilized members to engage in smoke fertilizer. In this way, fertilizer increased day by day.
    The Great Leap Forward target was 600 jin per mu. With water and fertilizer, it wouldn't work without careful cultivation! To cultivate carefully, you had to spend more labor. In previous years, all the strength was put into farm work and they were busy enough, but now they had to farm, build canals, and run several factories. Labor was extremely tight. After calculation, the cooperative cadres felt that there was only one way: to find ways to increase the labor attendance rate of women. The Pengbo Cooperative Management Committee adopted the following measures:
    Run large kindergartens and nurseries. The entire cooperative successively established four kindergartens and dozens of nurseries, absorbing a total of more than 600 infants and young children. In this way, the problem of women being dragged down by children was solved. Establish sewing factories to make clothes with machines. In this way, women didn't have to spend time and effort sewing stitch by stitch.
    Open small flour mills to process some of the raw materials into rice and flour. In this way, women didn't have to worry about milling rice and grinding flour. Then, a public canteen was established, which was warmly welcomed by single men, workers in cooperative-run factories, and women.
    With the implementation of these measures, the number of women participating in field labor increased day by day. Except for the old, weak, and disabled, more than 90% of the women in the entire cooperative went to the fields.
    The manpower has increased, but the work is still too busy. Had to look to reforming tools to free up labor! The Pengbo Cooperative brought together blacksmiths, carpenters, "know-it-alls," and "clever girls" from the seven villages to establish a farm implement manufacturing and repair factory.
        A New Page
    In early July 1958, the canals were basically completed, with four streams of clear water flowing in the four canals. In just over half a year, the plan to turn all dryland into irrigated land was realized. Who couldn't be excited? Due to sufficient water and fertilizer, the crops grew particularly lushly, people's morale was very high, and the cooperative cadres happily said: "This solves the contradiction between poor villages and rich villages!"
    The contradiction between poor villages and rich villages could be gradually resolved, but the difference between poor households and rich households was still considerable!
    Liang Shixin had thought about this issue long ago, and his notebook contained a lot of materials of this kind. The Pengbo Cooperative was considered a wealthy cooperative in the county, but every year, there were always 25% to 30% of households that were in debt. Were these people not working hard? No, just take cooperative member Wang Zhenshu! An old man in his fifties, who worked at least 300 labor days every year, was still in debt every year. What was the reason? Too many people. Other debtor households, either had too many people and too little labor, or suffered disasters and illnesses, incurred deficits due to weddings and funerals, and once they fell behind, they couldn't catch up. But some other households were not like this. Especially some households with few people and a lot of labor, had large deposits. Cooperative member Xu Huiwei, with a family of five, had four full laborers, and in 1957 alone, his family received more than 1,400 yuan. Debtor households often said, "Many debts are not a worry, many lice are not itchy. Anyway, working a few more labor days is still a debtor household."
    These issues constantly flashed through Liang Shixin's mind: "How can everyone live a good life? How can debtor households catch up with wealthy households?" One day, people were talking about future prospects, from the irrigation and electrification of their village to the happy life of communism. At this time, cooperative member Xu Chuanzhu muttered, "Don't talk so far, I'll be satisfied when we can eat grain for free!" This sentence gave Liang Shixin great inspiration, and he secretly pondered: "Yes! As long as we can first solve the problem of everyone's rations, everything will be easy." He immediately went to discuss this with the cooperative cadres. In those days, whenever the cooperative cadres had time to get together, they talked about this matter: grain is free, distributed according to the number of people, and then dividends are distributed according to labor days. This way, households with little labor and many people had their lives guaranteed; people with a lot of labor and few people were also taken care of. Naturally, the former group of people would be satisfied with this method, but would the latter group agree? At that time, they selected some wealthy households to calculate and sounded them out. The result was that these people would not suffer too much of a loss. Because this was a big problem, no decision was made at that time. A few days later, Liang Shixin went to the county for a meeting and told their ideas to Comrade Liu Cheng, the county party secretary. Secretary Liu very much agreed and asked them to first brew it among the masses and listen to people's reactions. In fact, this matter had already spread among the masses, and people were talking about it during labor and during rest. Some families with many people and little labor, whether they encountered Liang Shixin or other cooperative cadres, immediately asked, "When will the grain supply system be implemented?" Some wealthy households also expressed their support for this method. Wealthy household Zhao Yurui said: "Agricultural production is making a great leap forward, and the grain in the storehouses is overflowing. Do we still care about this little bit?"
    At this time, the Rural Work Department of the County Party Committee sent a working group to help them carry out their work. The Party branch officially held a discussion on this matter, and everyone unanimously agreed. Seeing that the time was ripe, a members' meeting was later convened. Things went very smoothly, everyone agreed, and at the same time, many new suggestions were put forward. Some people suggested: it would be best if all children could attend school for free; some people suggested: it would be best if the "five guarantees" households could be gathered together to live out their old age. The meeting that night was very lively, running from dark to midnight. The more people talked, the higher their enthusiasm, and the more they felt that the future was bright.
    Since that meeting, the Pengbo Cooperative has been vigorous and joyful everywhere. With hope in life, labor has gained momentum. Unfortunately, the summer harvest distribution had already passed, so the grain supply system had to wait until the autumn harvest to be implemented. What about other things? Everyone decided that what could be done should be done immediately. After the method of free schooling for cooperative members' children was implemented, thirty-seven out-of-school children quickly entered school. They also found a courtyard for the "five guarantees" households, settled these old people together, and gave it a name: "Home for the Elderly."
    Since the agricultural cooperative ran both industry and commerce, and the distribution system had also undergone major changes, everyone felt that calling it an agricultural cooperative was a bit of a misnomer, so it was renamed the "Communist Agricultural Cooperative."
          Ripe Fruit Falls Naturally
    The "Communist Agricultural Cooperative" spread all at once. Many people from surrounding agricultural cooperatives came to Liang Shixin to ask about this and that. Liang Shixin explained the entire process, and everyone listened very excitedly. Jia Huanxing, the director of the Haiyan Cooperative, said: "To run a communist agricultural cooperative, it's always better to run a large one than a small one, so that people can be concentrated, and strength can be concentrated. Why don't we merge together." Wei Jiahua, the secretary of the Dongsi branch, and Song Jinhai, the secretary of the Chenjiazhuang branch, also said: why don't we run the entire township as one cooperative. Many people agreed, feeling that unifying the township and the cooperative would make it easier to lead production. People happily talked for so long, although no formal decision was made, everyone considered it as a matter to be considered.
    Before long, the news that Suiping County, Henan Province, had established a people's commune was published in the newspaper. This was the same as their "Communist Agricultural Cooperative"! This was truly a ripe fruit falling naturally!
          ×　×　×　×　×
    Everything that needs to be said has been said. But there are still a few things that should be explained:
    First: The Great Leap Forward target of the Pengbo Cooperative was 600 jin per mu. What was the actual yield? Five hundred and eighty-five jin. Although the target was not achieved, the yield was still double that of 1956.
    Second: Perhaps some people will ask, what are the benefits of running a commune? Let the numbers answer: In 1959, the Wannianqing Commune's grain production increased by 26.2% compared to 1958; the average income of commune members increased by 50% compared to 1958, averaging ninety yuan per person. So-called averaging everyone means even the newly born children had a share; the total industrial output value of the commune in one year was more than 180,000 yuan (excluding the management area), which was incomparable to 1958, because it was zero in 1958; the total public accumulation of the commune in one year was 1.22 million yuan.

    春到人间花自开
    ——说说汾阳万年青公社成立以前的情况
    马烽
    山西汾阳万年青人民公社，是在1958年8月26日敲锣打鼓正式宣布成立的。但是在这以前的好几个月，这里虽然不叫人民公社，实际上所作所为却是人民公社“这一套”。
    要想弄清这个底细，得先从贾庄乡的蓬勃农业社大搞水利建设说起。
    蓬勃农业社是七个自然村合成的高级社。村子有大有小，有穷有富。1957年风雨不调，旱地庄稼减了产。富村有些社员人前背后嘀嘀咕咕，认为“跟上穷村吃了亏。”这些风言风语吹到了穷村社员们的耳朵里，谁听了心里能舒畅？事情一直闹到要分社。
    贾庄乡党委书记梁士信却坚决反对分社。他认为分社就是向后退，最根本问题是要大修水利，把全部旱地变成水地；要实现这一计划，必须继续办社。其实当时并没有人公开提出要分社，只是在暗地里嚷嚷，倒是梁士信干脆给挑明了，让大家讨论；经过一场大辩论，大家思想上都提高了一步。建设社会主义能够后退吗？决不能，坚决前进！
          事在人为
    这正是1957年冬天，各地都在开展农业大跃进运动。这里也掀起了旱地改水田的热潮。前二年人们在那些老旱地里一连打了十一眼井，一打一个黑窟窿，地下没水，有甚办法？办法倒有一个：用西面的井水浇东面的旱地。西面的地下水源很丰富，现成井就有二百多眼，光这些井里的水，差不多也能把全社一万多亩土地都浇遍。那么，为什么不早点这么干呢？干过，失败了——旱地离井太远，最远处有六公里。不等水流到地头，在渠道里差不多就渗漏光了。怎么办呢？
    众人是圣人。那些天，全社人都为这事动脑筋，讨论过来，研究过去，最后终于找到个窍门：修筑“三合土”渠道。
    筑三合土渠道，最要紧的是要有石灰。初步一计算，四条渠道的总长度有二十公里，需要二百多万斤石灰。到哪里去买这么多石灰？北廓和北关园有烧过石灰的人，禹门河滩里有的是青石，为什么要买呢？自己烧。很快一座石灰窑就投入生产了。
    筑渠道闸口要用砖，砌井台要砖，盖锅驼机房要砖；小渠道要用大桶瓦铺。这么多砖瓦到哪里去购买？没地方。古贤村有脱坯工，曹家庄有烧窑工，一座砖瓦厂又投入生产了。
    筑这么长的渠道，不好好测量行吗？怎么办？就地取材——找土专家。村里有些种了一辈子菜园子的老汉，虽然没摆弄过什么水平仪，不过只要他蹲在地头上看一看，就能看出哪高、哪低，水能不能流过去。还有些泥水匠、木匠，整天离不开垂直线、水平线。这些人搞测量不是很合适吗？于是一个测量组开始测量了。
    1957年冬天备料，做准备；1958年开春地刚解冻，四百五十人的一支队伍，就动手筑渠了。梁士信和社干部们也都亲自下手，和社员们一块劳动。第一条“三合土”渠道很快就筑成了。水由这条渠里奔流下来，全社的人都轰动了。有些老年人，感动地说：“渠里流的不是水，是粮食！要不是大跃进，做梦也办不到啊！”连过去坚决主张分社的人也说：“到底是社大力量大，这么大的工程，要靠一村一社，一定办不到啊！”
    三合土渠道，把七个村紧紧地连在一起了。
      一连串的问题
    修渠工程在继续进行，全部旱地变水地已不成问题。可是这么一来，牵扯出来的问题更多了。
    是些什么样的问题呢？第一条三合土渠道修成的时候，正好是中共八大二次会议的决议公布了，人们生产情绪更高了，胃口也更大了——修改跃进指标：在1956年的基础上翻一番，亩产平均达到五百七十六斤。社员们说：“干脆碰成整数吧！努力争取达到六百斤。”
    亩产六百斤，凭甚？光有水没有充足的肥料行吗？肥料，这真是个大问题。从1957年冬天就大闹积肥运动：掏茅、垫圈、挖炕灰、扫脏土……，忙了一冬天，到这时积下的厩肥、杂肥每亩只平均到二十七担。比起往年来要多得多了，可是产量指标提高了一倍多，不大批增加肥料行吗？别的农业社也为这事发愁。办法总是人想出来的。清徐县熬硝工人们研究出了制造土化肥的办法，县工业局派人去学习，连夜作了试验，第二天就召开现场会议，传授经验，号召各社自制土化肥。会后好多农业社积极筹建土化肥厂，蓬勃社也一样，立时就动手干起来。制化肥用的工具，这村没有那村有，很快也就凑齐了。到底是社大潜力大，人多好办事。别的社土化肥厂还没有筹建完毕，这里已经制出成品来了。接着，他们又组织了一个培植细菌肥的小组，建立了一个养猪场，同时还发动社员大搞熏肥。这么一来，肥料一天比一天增多了。
    跃进指标是亩产六百斤，有了水和肥，不精耕细作也不行啊！要精耕细作就得多花劳动力。往年，全部力量放在农活上都够忙的了，而现在又要种地、又要筑渠、又开办了好几个工厂，劳动力紧张极了。社干部划算来划算去，觉得只有一个办法：想方设法提高妇女的劳动出勤率。蓬勃社管理委员会采取了以下几项措施：
    大办幼儿园、托儿组。全社先后共办起四个幼儿园和几十个托儿组，总共吸收了六百多个婴儿和幼儿。这么一来，妇女们被孩子拖累的问题解决了。成立缝纫厂，用机器做衣服。这么一来，就用不着妇女们一针一线熬时间，费工夫了。
    开办小型面粉厂，把一部分原料加工成米、面。这么一来，碾米磨面的事也不用妇女们操劳了。接着又建立了一个公共食堂，受到了单身汉、社办工厂的工人和妇女们的热烈欢迎。
    这几项措施一实现，妇女参加田间劳动的人数一天比一天增多。除了老弱残废，全社90％以上的妇女都下地了。
    人手是增加了，工作还是忙不过来。只好向改革工具要劳动力！蓬勃社把七个村的铁匠、木匠、“百事通”、“巧姑娘”一类的人物集中在一起，成立起一个农具制造修配厂。
        新的一页
    1958年7月初，渠道基本上完工了，四条渠道里流着四股清水。只用了半年多时间，全部旱地变水地的计划实现了。谁能不兴奋呢？由于水足粪饱，庄稼长的特别茂盛，人们情绪都很高，社干部们高兴地说：“这一下穷村富村的矛盾算是解决啦！”
    穷村和富村的矛盾是可以逐步得到解决，可是穷户和富户的差别还相当大哩！
    梁士信早就想这个问题了，他的小本子上记着很多这一类的材料。蓬勃社在全县来说算是个富裕社，但是每年算下账来总有25％到30％的欠款户。这些人家是劳动不好吗？不，就说社员王振树吧！一个五十多岁的老汉，每年至少要作三百多个劳动日，然而每年都欠债。什么原因呢？人口太多。别的欠款户，不是人口多劳动力少，就是生灾害病，婚丧嫁娶闹下亏空，一步差下就步步赶不上了。而另外一些人家却不是这样。特别是人口少劳动力多的一些户，都有大批的存款。社员徐惠伟，全家五口人，就有四个全劳动力，1957年光他一家就分了一千四百多元。欠款户常这么说：“债多不愁，虱多不痒。反正多做几个劳动日也还是欠款户。”
    这些问题，经常在梁士信脑子里晃来晃去：“怎样才能使所有的人过上好日子？怎样才能使欠款户赶上富裕户呢？”有一天，人们谈论起了前途远景。从本村的水利化、电气化，一直说到共产主义的幸福生活。这时候，社员徐传柱闷声闷气地插了一句：“不要说那么远，啥时候吃粮食不要钱了，我就心满意足啦！”这句话给了梁士信很大启发，心里暗暗思忖：“对！只要能先把所有的人的口粮问题解决了，一切问题就好办了。”他立刻就去找社干部商量。那些天，社干部们一有时间碰在一起，就谈论这事：粮食不要钱，按人定量发，然后再按劳动日分红。这么办，劳动力少、人口多的户生活有了保证；劳动力多、人口少的人也照顾到了。这办法，前一部分人自然会满意，后一部分人会不会同意呢？当时他们挑了部分富裕户算了算账，摸了摸底，结果是这些人家并吃不了多大的亏。因为这是个大问题，当时没有做出决定。隔了几天，梁士信到县里开会，就把他们的想法和县委书记柳成同志说了。柳书记很赞成，要他们先在群众中酝酿酝酿，听听人们的反映。其实，这事早在群众中传开了，人们在劳动当中，休息时候，都在谈论这件事。一些人口多、劳动力少的人家，不管碰到梁士信还是碰到其他社干部，劈头就问：“什么时候实行粮食供给制呀？”有些富裕户也表示赞成这一办法。富裕户赵玉瑞说：“农业生产大跃进，囤子里粮食满的流出来了。还在乎这点吗？”
    正在这时，县委农村工作部派了一个工作组来帮助他们进行工作，党支部把这件事正式作了一次讨论，大家一致同意。看看时机已经成熟，后来就召开了社员大会。事情进行的很顺利，大家都赞成，同时又提出了许多新的建议。有人提议：最好能让所有的孩子免费上学；有人提议：最好能把五保户集中起来养老。这天晚上的会开得很热烈，从天黑直开到半夜，人们越说，劲头越高，越感到前途美好。
    自从这天开罢会，蓬勃社到处都是蓬蓬勃勃，喜气洋洋。生活有了希望，劳动添了劲头。可惜这时候夏收分配已经过去，那么粮食供给制只好等秋收实行。别的事情呢？大家决定，能办的马上就办。社员子弟免费入学的办法实行以后，很快就有三十七个失学儿童入了学。他们又给五保户找了一所院子，把这些老人们安顿在一起，起了个名字叫“养老院”。
    农业社既办工业，又管商业，而分配制度也有了重大的改变，大家觉得叫农业社有点文不对题，于是就改叫“共产主义农业社”。
          瓜熟自落
    “共产主义农业社”一下子传开了。周围农业社好些人来找梁士信问这问那。梁士信把前后经过说了一番，大家听得很兴奋。海燕社主任贾焕星说：“要办共产主义农业社，办大的总比办小的好，人才能集中，力量也能集中，干脆咱们合到一起吧。”董寺支书魏嘉华、陈家庄支书宋金海也都表示：不如咱们全乡办成一个社。好多人都赞成，觉得把乡和社统一起来，领导生产更方便一些。人们兴高采烈地谈论了这么半天，虽然没有正式作决定，不过从这以后，大家都当回事情考虑起来了。
    没有多久的时间，报纸上登出了河南遂平县办起了人民公社的消息，这和他们办的“共产主义农业社”一样呵！这真是瓜熟蒂落！
          ×　×　×　×　×
    要说的话都说完了。不过还有几件事情应当交代一下：
    第一件：蓬勃社的跃进指标是亩产六百斤，结果究竟打了多少呢？五百八十五斤。指标虽然没有实现，可是比1956年的产量还是增加了一倍。
    第二件：也许有人会问，办公社好处在哪里呢？让数目字回答吧：1959年，万年青公社粮食比1958年增产了26.2％；社员平均收入比1958年增加了50％，每人平均九十元，所谓每人平均就是连刚生下的小孩都有一份；公社的工业总产值十八万多元（不包括管理区的），和1958年没法比，因为1958年是零；公社一年来的公共积累总共是一百二十二万元。
