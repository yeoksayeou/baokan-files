Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 31st - Zhejiang Province is in the midst of a comprehensive late rice harvest, and many areas are seeing large areas of "thousand-jin fields."

The biggest characteristic of this year's bumper late rice harvest in Zhejiang Province is that regardless of fertile plains, low-lying rotten fields, deep mountain cold water, high mountain terraces, island thin soil, or coastal reclaimed land, large areas of high-yield fields producing over 1,000 jin have appeared. Jinyun County, located in high mountains and steep valleys, mostly plants its single-season late rice in terraced fields and cold water fields in high mountain cold valleys, but relying on the superiority of the communes, it has produced 7,334 mu of "thousand-jin fields," with the county's "thousand-jin" late rice fields increasing more than sevenfold compared to last year. Changxi Commune in Changhua County, located in a large mountainous area, has 353 mu of late rice exceeding 1,000 jin. Kuntong Brigade of Xiaoshi Commune in Anji County has 121 mu of thin, barren land averaging 1,073 jin per mu. The commune's already harvested 2,142 mu of late mid-season rice averages 760 jin of dry grain per mu, an increase of 83% over last year. Pujiang County, located on the edge of the Puyang River in a hilly area, has also seen many "thousand-jin" rice paddies. Zhongyu Brigade of Pufeng Commune planted a total of 524 mu of late rice, averaging 888 jin of dry grain per mu, an increase of 50% over last year, of which 256 mu averaged 1,175 jin per mu. The Hangjiahu and Ningshao plains and the Zhoushan Islands, which have just begun harvesting, have also reported many good news stories about "thousand-jin" late rice, with areas of ten mu or hundreds of mu. Wangchun Commune in Ningbo City has nearly 2,000 mu of late rice breaking the "thousand-jin" mark.

Following the bumper harvests of spring flowers and early rice, Zhejiang Province has once again won an unprecedented bumper harvest of late rice, once again demonstrating the powerful vitality and unparalleled superiority of the people's communes. Xintong Commune in Fuyang County, on the banks of the Fuchun River, built pumping stations, and repaired more than 30 li of irrigation canals, while also drawing out a large number of laborers. 750 mu of sandy land has been transformed into fertile paddy fields. The already harvested 125 mu of late rice, after drying and winnowing, averages 1,285 jin of dry grain per mu. Many communes have achieved bumper harvests after overcoming natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and insect pests. In particular, since the end of July, Zhejiang has been continuously hit by typhoons and rainstorms, as well as suffering from plant diseases and insect pests, and some areas have experienced drought, but under the unified arrangement of the communes for labor and tools, and with the broad masses of commune members displaying soaring enthusiasm, natural disasters have been overcome time and time again. The commune members said: The commune has great power, and production increases every season.

    浙江晚稻出现大批千斤田
    新华社杭州31日电　浙江省在全面收割晚稻中，很多地方出现大面积千斤田。
    今年浙江省晚稻大丰收的最大特点是：不管平原沃野，低洼烂田，深山冷水，高山梯田，海岛薄土，海滨涂田，都出现了大片千斤以上高产田。位于高山峻岭的缙云县，绝大部分单季晚稻都种在高山冷谷的梯田和冷水田里，但是依靠公社的优越性，出现了七千三百三十四亩千斤田，全县千斤晚稻田比去年猛增七倍多。地处大山区的昌化县昌西公社，有三百五十三亩晚稻超过千斤。安吉县晓市公社昆铜大队一百二十一亩土薄瘠田，平均亩产一千零七十三斤，这个公社已经收割的二千一百四十二亩迟中稻，平均亩产干谷七百六十斤，比去年增产83％。地处丘陵地带的浦阳江边浦江县，也出现许多千斤稻。普丰公社中余大队共种五百二十四亩晚稻，平均亩产干谷八百八十八斤，比去年增产五成，其中二百五十六亩平均亩产一千一百七十五斤。刚开始收割的杭嘉湖和宁绍平原地区和舟山群岛也传来许多千斤晚稻的捷报，面积都在十亩或百亩以上，宁波市望春公社有近两千亩晚稻突破千斤关。
    浙江省继春花、早稻大丰收之后，晚稻又赢得空前大丰收，再一次显示了人民公社的强大生命力和无比的优越性。富春江边的富阳县新桐公社建了抽水机站，修了三十多里长的灌溉渠道，同时抽出大批劳力。把七百五十亩沙地改造成肥沃的水田，现在已收割的一百二十五亩晚稻，经过晒干扬净，平均亩产干谷一千二百八十五斤。许多公社都是经过战胜水旱虫等自然灾害以后才获得大丰收的。特别是从7月底以来，浙江各地连续遭受到台风暴雨的侵袭，又遭到病虫害危害，部分地区发生干旱，但是在各公社统一安排劳力、工具，广大社员发挥冲天干劲，自然灾害一次又一次地被战胜了。社员们说：公社力量大，产量季季高。
