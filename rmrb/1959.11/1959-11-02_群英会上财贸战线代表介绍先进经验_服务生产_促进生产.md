Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: Several advanced collectives and advanced producer representatives from the commerce, grain, and service industries have, in their speeches and written statements at the Heroes' Conference in the past few days, vividly illustrated the significant achievements made by the vast number of employees on China's finance and trade front in promoting industrial and agricultural production and serving the people's lives, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line.

　　The Weihe Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shangzhi County, Heilongjiang Province, is an advanced unit with remarkable achievements in promoting diversified rural economy. Wang Yanmin, the director of this supply and marketing cooperative, said in his written statement that Weihe is a mountainous area with nine parts mountains, half part water and half part farmland. Since 1958, the supply and marketing cooperative has helped the people's communes formulate plans for developing diversified operations such as "eight raisings" (cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, bees, silkworms, fish, rabbits) and "ten cultivations" (ginseng, fritillary bulbs, strawberries, broomcorn, fruit trees, crown gourds, mushrooms, yellow tobacco, hemp, vegetables). After a year of efforts, the commercial departments purchased various commodities worth more than 1.2 million yuan from the communes, increasing the average income of each farmer by 113 yuan. The formerly notorious "poor mountain gully" has now become a "golden river, mountain of treasures". Wang Yanmin finally stated that they are determined to exert even greater efforts in 1960 to vigorously develop diversified operations and resolutely act as promoters of the continued Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture.

　　The Tongjialiang Store in Datong City, Shanxi Province, is a red flag unit that does everything possible to support industrial production. The Ministry of Commerce recently held an on-site meeting in Datong City to promote their experience. Wei Hongshun, the representative of this store, introduced their experience at the conference, saying that since 1958, we have combined our purchasing and sales activities with the Great Leap Forward in coal mine production, and found the correct direction for commercial work in mining areas. Under the slogan "Everything for producing more coal," our store established a "Support Production Headquarters," took the initiative to understand the needs of the coal mines, supplied whatever the coal mines needed, supplied wherever production went, and supplied whenever it was needed. For the families of employees, the store planned the scope of operations and supply areas, delivering the goods needed by workers directly to their homes. The store also added 55 new types of service items such as buying and selling on behalf of customers, sewing, washing, and repairing. These efforts greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the coal mine employees and played a significant role in supporting the Tongjialiang Coal Mine to maintain a daily production level of 10,000 tons of coal for seven consecutive months.

　　Cui Guangcheng, the representative of the nationally renowned commercial red flag unit—Beijing Tianqiao Department Store, excitedly reported to the conference on the first day of the conference about the continuous leap forward of Tianqiao Department Store while holding high the red flag. He said that based on summarizing the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Tianqiao Department Store has made another leap forward this year in improving service attitude, increasing product knowledge, and improving business management. From January to September this year, the average daily turnover of salespersons reached 251 yuan, an increase of 57.9% compared with the same period last year. Expenses decreased by 1.69% compared with the same period last year, and profits turned over to the state also increased by 1.23 times compared with the same period last year. Cui Guangcheng stated in his speech that they must guard against arrogance and rashness, never be complacent, and do their future work even better.

　　Guan Xinyang, the representative of the Xiangang Grain Management Station in Kaiping County, Guangdong Province, and Yu Weizhong, the representative of the Cangqian Grain Management Station in Lin'an County, Zhejiang Province, who have made outstanding achievements in grain storage work, respectively introduced to the conference their advanced deeds in fighting against rats, sparrows, and insect pests in order to prevent the country's grain from suffering the slightest loss. Guan Xinyang said that our grain management station has maintained the red flag since it was awarded the honorary title of "Mold-Free Grain Depot" by the Ministry of Grain in April 1954. Since 1955, we have fully realized "no insects, no mold, no rats or sparrows, no accidents." Storage costs have decreased year by year, and by 1958, storage losses had been eliminated. In the past few years, we have saved the country more than 19,000 yuan and nearly 350,000 jin of grain. This year, we have achieved "seven nos" on the basis of the past "four nos" (the added "three nos" are no epidemics, no odors, and no discoloration). At the same time, we also helped 167 commune warehouses reach the "four nos" standard. Guan Xinyang said that we will continue to muster greater revolutionary enthusiasm and strive to build a socialist and scientific granary.

　　The Jinan Zhongdong Hotel in Shandong Province, which was transformed into a joint state-private enterprise in the upsurge of socialist transformation in 1956, has now won the honorary title of "Red Flag Unit" for finance and trade work in Shandong Province. Gai Yinglin, the representative of this hotel, said at the conference that after the rectification movement and the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we overcame the past erroneous idea and sense of inferiority that the service industry was "lowly" and realized that doing service work well is a noble labor and an indispensable part of the socialist construction cause. We enthusiastically serve the passengers, proactively solve the difficulties of the passengers in life, and ensure that the passengers live well and eat well under the conditions of poor housing. Therefore, the passengers praised us as "a sincere heart for the passengers, leaving all kinds of difficulties to ourselves." Gai Yinglin said that we are determined to do our best to make our hotel a veritable "home for travelers."

    群英会上财贸战线代表介绍先进经验
    服务生产　促进生产
    据新华社1日讯　来自商业、粮食、服务行业的许多先进集体和先进生产者代表，几天来在群英大会上的发言和书面发言，生动地说明在总路线光辉照耀下，我国财贸战线广大职工在促进工农业生产、为人民生活服务等方面，已经作出了显著成绩。
    黑龙江省尚志县苇河供销部是促进农村发展多种经营有显著成绩的先进单位。这个供销部的主任王彦民在书面发言中说，苇河是一个九山半水半分田的山区。1958年以来供销部帮助人民公社制订了“八养”（牛、羊、猪、鸡、蜂、蚕、鱼、兔），“十种”（人参、平贝、草梅、笤条、果树、角窝瓜、蘑菇、黄烟、大麻、蔬菜）等发展多种经营的规划。经过一年的努力，商业部门就向公社收购各种商品价值一百二十多万元，使每一农民平均增加收入一百一十三元。过去有名的“穷山沟”现在已经变成“金钱河，万宝山”。王彦民最后表示，他们决心在1960年鼓起更大的干劲，大力发展多种经营，坚决当好工农业继续大跃进的促进派。
    山西省大同市同家梁商店是千方百计支援工业生产的一面红旗。商业部最近在大同市召开现场会议推广了他们的经验。这个商店的代表魏洪顺在大会上介绍他们的经验说，1958年以来，我们把自己的购销活动与煤矿生产大跃进结合在一起，找到了工矿区商业工作的正确方向。在“一切为了多出煤炭”的口号下，我们商店建立了“支援生产指挥部”，主动了解煤矿的需要，煤矿要什么，我们就供应什么；生产到哪里，供应到哪里；什么时候需要，什么时候供应。对于职工家庭，商店规划了经营范围和供应区域，把工人所需要的商品直接送上门去。商店还增加了代买代卖和缝洗修理等五十五种新型服务项目。这些工作大大鼓舞了煤矿职工的劳动积极性，对于支援同家梁煤矿连续七个月保持日产万吨煤的生产水平，起了很大作用。
    全国著名的商业红旗单位——北京天桥商场代表崔广成，在大会发言的第一天就兴奋地向大会报告了天桥商场高举红旗不断跃进的情况。他说，天桥商场在总结1958年大跃进经验的基础上，今年以来，在改进服务态度，增加商品知识，改善经营管理方面，又向前跃进了一步。今年1至9月份售货员平均每天营业额达到二百五十一元，比去年同期提高了57.9％，费用比去年同期降低了1.69％，上缴利润也比去年同期增加一点二三倍。崔广成在发言中表示，他们一定戒骄戒躁永不自满，把今后的工作做得更好。
    在粮食保管工作中作出了出色成绩的广东省开平县蚬岗粮食管理所代表关新扬和浙江省临安县仓前粮良管理所代表虞维忠分别向大会介绍了他们为了不让国家粮食受到丝毫损失，与鼠、雀、虫害作斗争的先进事迹。关新扬说，我们粮管所自1954年4月由粮食部授予全国“无霉粮仓”的光荣称号以来，一直保持了红旗。1955年起又全面实现了“无虫、无霉、无鼠雀、无事故”。保管费用逐年下降，到1958年已经消灭了仓储损耗。这几年共为国家节约资金一万九千多元，节约粮食近三十五万斤。今年我们又在过去“四无”的基础上实现了“七无”（增加的“三无”是无疫病、无异味、无变色）。同时，还帮助一百六十七座公社仓库达到“四无”标准。关新扬说，我们今后还要鼓起更大的革命干劲，为建设一个社会主义科学化的粮仓而努力。
    在1956年社会主义改造高潮中转为公私合营的山东省济南市中东旅社，现在已经荣获山东省财贸工作“红旗单位”的光荣称号。这个旅社的代表盖迎林在大会上说，经过整风运动和1958年大跃进，我们克服了过去认为服务行业“低三下四”的错误思想和自卑感，认识到做好服务工作是一种高尚的劳动，是社会主义建设事业不可缺少的一部分。我们热情地为旅客服务，主动解决旅客生活上的困难，在房屋条件较差的情况下，保证旅客住好、吃好。因此旅客们都称赞我们是“一片赤心为旅客，万般困难留自己。”盖迎林说，我们决心尽最大的努力，使我们的旅社成为名副其实的“旅客之家”。
