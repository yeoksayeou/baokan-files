Grow More Vegetables and Store More Firewood to Get Through the Winter
Liling Continues to Expand Vegetable Planting Area, Striving to Store 1,000 Jin of Dried Vegetables Per Person
You County Draws 60,000 People to Chop Firewood and Transport Coal, Storing Four Months' Worth of Winter Fuel

(Our Newspaper) News: In order to consolidate public canteens and make full preparations for further improving the lives of the masses, Liling County, Hunan Province, has launched a large-scale vegetable planting campaign. To date, the county has planted more than 97,000 mu of vegetables, exceeding the original plan by 63% and increasing the vegetable planting area by 112% compared to last year. These vegetables are growing well, greatly increasing the amount of vegetables consumed by commune members themselves, and also increasing the market supply of vegetables. More than 10,000 public canteens in the county eat an average of two jin of vegetables per person per day. The entire county is working hard to store 1,000 jin of dried vegetables per person to get through the winter.

Since the beginning of autumn, the Liling County Committee of the Communist Party of China has regarded grasping vegetable production as an important link in consolidating public canteens and implementing the economical and planned use of grain, and has assigned a member of the county committee to be in charge of vegetable production. Communes and brigades, as well as large water conservancy projects and construction units, all have dedicated personnel to manage vegetable production. On October 28, the county committee issued another instruction, requiring the vegetable area to be further expanded to 100,000 mu. After the instruction was issued, in just one week, the vegetable sowing area increased from 87,000 mu at the end of October to more than 100,000 mu. Green vegetables and cabbage were planted on most of the field ditches of the 380,000 mu of green manure fields. Organs, factories, and schools also used their spare time to plant a large number of vegetables. The twenty-nine larger water conservancy construction sites in the county also planted more than 2,500 mu of vegetables.

In order to expand the vegetable planting area, the county, while increasing the yield per unit area, vigorously promoted intercropping, multiple cropping, and reclaiming wasteland. Wherever vegetables could be planted on the edges of fields, the edges of land, the edges of mountains, and empty spaces, they were planted as much as possible. All parts of the county also universally established specialized teams and groups, strengthened business management, and promoted the "three guarantees" (guaranteeing production, guaranteeing labor, guaranteeing cost) and "five determinations" (determining people, determining fields, determining fertilizer, determining work points, determining yield) responsibility system, striving for high yield and abundant harvest of vegetables. The vegetables in Dingfang Brigade of Chengguan Commune are growing well, with an average yield of more than 10,000 jin per mu. In addition to being self-sufficient, this commune can also sell more than 60,000 jin of vegetables every day, which not only improves the lives of commune members and saves grain, but also increases income.

In the expansion and cultivation of vegetables, from the county committee to the communes, brigades, and production teams, efforts were made to develop vegetable high-yield fields. More than 8,000 commune and team cadres and party members in the county planted more than 10,000 mu of vegetable high-yield fields, which greatly promoted vegetable production. Seventeen cadres and party members of the Xitang Brigade of Chashanling Commune planted 40 mu of vegetable high-yield fields. The cabbage planted by Brigade Leader Yang Donglv weighed more than five jin per head, with a yield of more than 10,000 jin per mu, setting an example for the masses.

(Our Newspaper) News: During the winter production campaign, You County, Hunan Province, has drawn 60,000 laborers to chop firewood and transport coal to store fuel for cooking and heating during the winter.

The weather in the south is getting colder. Storing firewood is a major event in the lives of the masses. Based on the specific situation of the county, the You County Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly arranged for the fuel for rural canteens and the firewood for commune members' heating, requiring the county's 430,000 rural population to store enough fuel for four months, calculated at one jin of coal or two jin of firewood per person per day; to be prepared for rainy days with sunny days, and to be prepared for busy times with idle times, so that there is dry firewood on rainy days and no firewood shortage during busy farming seasons.

The county committee made thorough arrangements for the work of storing fuel for the winter. It required that all places where firewood and coal resources can be self-sufficient should vigorously organize labor to go up the mountains to chop firewood and transport coal, chopping and transporting at the same time, and drying and storing at the same time; all places that have sold firewood and coal in the past should include firewood chopping and coal mining in the sideline production plan, actively mining to support firewood-deficient areas. The county committee also made a unified plan for the county's firewood mountains and coal mines to ensure that both industrial coal and rural coal are taken into account. The county committee instructed all communes to set aside time for commune members to arrange for household firewood for winter heating while planning for canteen fuel. The production teams must also make early preparations for the heating fuel for homes for the elderly, nurseries, and kindergartens.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the fuel storage work, the County Life and Welfare Office designated cadres to focus on the felling, mining, and transfer of fuel. The party committees of the communes, the general party branches of the brigades, and the branches of the production teams all regarded this work as an important task to be completed.

Now, a mass movement to store fuel for the winter, with the assistance of the county's commercial and transportation departments, has been universally launched since the 10th of this month. Many commune canteens and commune members have stored a large amount of firewood by picking up firewood and sweeping fallen leaves.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 15th: The public canteens of Daolin People's Commune in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, have prepared enough firewood for cooking and heating for the winter. The entire commune has prepared more than 800,000 dan of firewood, with an average of more than 540 dan per canteen, which can be burned for more than five months.

When the recent cold wave arrived, all the homes for the elderly and kindergartens in the commune had dry firewood for heating. Many canteens also have "heating rooms." Every day after dinner, male and female commune members sit around the heating room, warming themselves by the fire while discussing the benefits that the people's commune has brought to everyone. The commune members are very satisfied with the amount of firewood prepared this year. Zhu Xinming, a poor peasant commune member of Xin Si Production Team of Qingshi Brigade, said: In the past, when working individually, firewood was still in the mountains at this time. By the eleventh and twelfth months of the lunar year, even melon shed slats were burned as firewood. Now, the firewood in each canteen is piled up like mountains.

The Daolin Commune Party Committee is very concerned about the lives of the commune members and paid attention to the problem of the commune members getting through the winter early on. In early October, the commune party committee found that some canteens did not have enough firewood prepared, but a few cadres believed that "firewood has little to do with production, and if firewood is needed, just send two or three people to chop a little temporarily." The commune party committee believed that this idea was wrong, and that insufficient firewood preparation would not only directly affect the lives of the commune members this winter and next spring, but would also be detrimental to next year's production. Therefore, in conjunction with accumulating fertilizer and winter water conservancy repairs, it immediately organized more than 4,600 laborers and formed firewood chopping professional teams based on brigades; brigades with relatively scarce firewood resources organized more than 900 commune members and opened thirteen small coal mines; and commune members of each production team also prepared firewood for the winter in conjunction with winter pest control and land reclamation.

    多种菜多贮柴过好冬天
    醴陵继续扩大种菜面积争取每人贮足千斤干菜
    攸县抽调六万人砍柴运煤贮备四个月过冬燃料
    本报讯　湖南省醴陵县为了巩固公共食堂，为进一步改善群众生活作好充分的准备，展开了一个大规模的种蔬菜运动。到目前止，全县共种蔬菜九万七千多亩，超过原计划63％，比去年种菜面积增加了112％。这些蔬菜生长良好，大大增加了社员自食蔬菜的数量，同时也增加了市场蔬菜供应量。全县一万多个公社食堂，平均每人每天吃二斤蔬菜。全县正在为每人储备一千斤干菜过冬而努力。
    中共醴陵县委入秋以来，就把抓好蔬菜生产，当成是巩固公共食堂、贯彻节约用粮和计划用粮的一个重要环节，抽出一个县委委员专管蔬菜生产。公社和大队，以及大的水利工程和基建单位，都有专人管理蔬菜生产。10月28日，县委又发出指示，要求把蔬菜面积进一步扩大到十万亩。指示下达以后，只一周时间，蔬菜播种面积由10月底的八万七千亩达到了十万多亩。三十八万亩绿肥田的田沟边大部分种上了青菜、白菜。机关、工厂、学校也利用工余时间种了大量蔬菜。全县二十九个较大的水利工程工地，也种了蔬菜二千五百多亩。
    为了扩大种菜面积，该县在提高单位面积产量的同时，大力提倡间种、复种和开垦荒地。使田边、地边、山边和空坪隙地能种菜的地方，都尽可能的种上蔬菜。全县各地还普遍建立了专业队、组，加强了经营管理，推行了“三包”（包产、包工、包成本）、“五定”（定人、定田、定肥料、定工分、定产量）的责任制，力争蔬菜高产多收。城关公社丁坊大队的蔬菜，丘丘长得好，平均亩产可达一万斤以上。这个公社的蔬菜除自给之外，每天还可出售六万多斤，不仅改善了社员生活，节约了粮食，而且增加了收入。
    在扩种和培育蔬菜中，从县委到公社、大队、生产队，大搞蔬菜丰产田。全县有八千多个社、队干部和党员种有蔬菜丰产田一万多亩，大大推动了蔬菜生产。茶山岭公社西塘大队十七个干部和党员种了四十亩蔬菜丰产田，大队长杨冬律种的白菜每兜已有五斤多重，每亩产量达万斤以上，为群众树立了榜样。
    本报讯　湖南省攸县在冬季生产运动中，已抽出六万劳力砍柴运煤，储备煮饭、烤火过冬燃料。
    南方天气日趋寒冷。储备烧柴是群众生活中的一件大事。中共攸县县委根据全县具体情况，及时对农村食堂燃料和社员取暖柴草作了安排，要求全县四十三万农村人口，按每人每天用煤一斤或者用柴二斤计算，贮足四个月的燃料；做到以晴备雨，以闲备忙，雨天有干柴，农忙无柴荒。
    县委对贮备过冬燃料工作做了周密的布置。要求凡是柴源、煤源可自给的地方，应大力组织劳动力上山砍柴运煤，边砍边运，边晒边藏；凡是过去有柴、煤出售的地方，应把砍柴、采煤列入副业生产计划，积极采挖，支援缺柴地区。县委还将全县柴山、煤矿进行了统一规划，以保证工业用煤和农村用煤同时兼顾。县委指示各公社在计划食堂燃料的同时，还应给社员留出时间安排家用柴火，作为过冬取暖之用。敬老院、托儿所、幼儿园的取暖燃料，各生产队也必须及早作好准备。
    为了加强对燃料储备工作的领导，县生活福利办公室指定干部专抓燃料的砍伐、采挖和调运。各公社党委、大队总支以及生产队的支部，都把这一工作当作一项重要任务去完成。
    现在，一个群众性贮备过冬燃料运动，在县的商业、运输部门的协助下，从本月10日后已普遍开展起来，许多公社食堂和社员都用拾柴、扫落叶等办法，贮集了大量柴草。
    据新华社长沙15日电　湖南省宁乡县道林人民公社的公共食堂，已经备足了过冬烧饭和取暖用的柴火。全社共准备柴火八十多万担，平均每个食堂有五百四十多担，可以烧五个月以上。
    最近寒潮到来的时候，公社各个敬老院、幼儿园都有干柴烧火取暖。许多食堂还设有“烤火间”，每天晚饭以后，男女社员们围坐在烤火间里，一边烤火，一边谈论着人民公社给大家带来的好处。社员们对今年准备了这么多的柴火非常满意。青石大队新司生产队贫农社员朱新明说：往年单干，这个时候烧柴还在山里。到了十冬腊月，连瓜棚条子都当柴烧了。现在个个食堂的柴火都堆得像山似的。
    道林公社党委对社员生活很关心，及早注意了社员过冬的问题。10月初，公社党委发现有些食堂柴火准备得不足，有少数干部却认为“柴火与生产的关系不大，要柴烧，派两三个人临时砍一点就行了。”公社党委认为这种思想不对，柴火准备不足不仅会直接影响到今冬明春的社员生活，而且也将对明年的生产不利。因此，便结合积肥和冬修水利立即组织四千六百多个劳力，以大队为单位成立了砍柴专业队；柴源比较缺乏的大队，组织了九百多个社员，开了十三处小煤窑；各生产队的社员们还结合搞冬季除虫和开荒，准备过冬柴火。
