    The Magnificent Strides of the Seven-Year Plan
    Soviet Union, Wei Bojiaqiao夫
    The historically significant 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union marked the entry of the Soviet Union into a period of comprehensively unfolding the construction of a communist society. The control figures for the development of the Soviet Union's national economy from 1959 to 1965, adopted by the Congress, are a program based on science for developing Soviet socialist society and advancing towards the path of communism. This seven-year period will be a decisive stage in establishing the material and technical foundation for building communism in the Soviet Union and for establishing the material and technical foundation for the entire socialist camp to conduct an economic competition with the capitalist camp.
    All of progressive humanity welcomes the grand figures of the Seven-Year Plan with great enthusiasm. The working people of the whole world regard the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan as a new and vivid manifestation of the fundamental superiority of the socialist economic system over the capitalist economic system.
    Some bourgeois economists, as always, doubt the realism of this new plan. They have repeatedly proven that the economies of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries were able to develop at a high speed in the past because these countries industrialized from a very low level. But now that the Soviet Union has become a highly developed industrial power, ranking second in the world in industrial output, its further high-speed development seems impossible. According to these economists, high speed will inevitably decrease.
    What is the actual situation?
    The current Seven-Year Plan is not just a program; it has been implemented for nearly a year. The selfless labor of the Soviet people and the organizational activities of the Communist Party have enabled new and enormous reserves for the development of the Soviet national economy to be discovered and put into effect. It is now possible to summarize the initial results of the plan's implementation.
    The industrial production plan for the first nine months of 1959 has been comprehensively overfulfilled. Compared with the same period last year, the total industrial output value for the first nine months increased by 12%. The growth rate of industrial production in various sectors has increased. There is every reason to assume that the total industrial output in 1959 will increase by more than 11% compared with last year (the original plan stipulated 7.7%). Therefore, by the end of this year, the Soviet Union's over-planned industrial products will be approximately 35 to 40 billion rubles.
    "Judging from the situation in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan and the projections for 1960," Comrade Khrushchev said when meeting with representatives of American industrialists and social figures in Pittsburgh, USA, on September 24, "our industrial production will have a greater growth than originally planned. As a result, we estimate that the tasks set by the Seven-Year Plan will be overfulfilled, and the plan will be completed ahead of schedule."
    Along with the increase in industrial production, the tasks of increasing labor productivity and reducing the cost of industrial products have also been overfulfilled. Labor productivity in industry increased by 8% in the first nine months. The unplanned savings from reducing industrial products amounted to 4 billion rubles in the first half of the year alone.
    After analyzing all the possibilities for increasing production in their respective regions, the Party organizations and economic organs of the Vladimir City and Sverdlovsk economic regions formulated a series of measures that would enable the production level stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan to be reached ahead of schedule by utilizing internal reserves without increasing state investment. Workers in industrial enterprises in Leningrad were the first to launch a campaign to complete the labor productivity level of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Metallurgical workers and miners in the Dnepropetrovsk Oblast guaranteed to reach the production level of metal and coal stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan in 1963, two years ahead of schedule. The Moscow City National Economic Council has formulated measures to mobilize potential forces within factories, which provide the possibility of greatly increasing the production of machine tool manufacturing. The funds consumed for this purpose only account for half of the funds required to build new enterprises.
    The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on technological progress in industry and construction had a tremendous impact on the further improvement of industrial production. This plenary session can be said to be a continuation of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. It concretized the decisions of the Congress in improving production technology, summarized the experience accumulated by various industrial sectors in striving for technological progress, and pointed out a series of practical organizational measures to ensure the rapid development of technological progress in the national economy.
    The completion of agricultural production in the Seven-Year Plan will be reviewed by the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to be held in November and December of this year. Although the climate conditions in many regions this year are not good, the total harvest of many crops such as grains and sugar beets is expected to exceed the average annual harvest of the most recent five years, and cotton will have a bumper harvest. The sowing plan for winter crops this year has been overfulfilled.
    The growth of production has improved the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people. From July 1, the prices of clocks, bicycles, cameras, certain products of the radio industry, and certain synthetic fiber products have been reduced. Not long ago, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union passed a resolution on completing the transition period for shortening the working day and adjusting the wages of employees. The resolution stipulates the specific deadlines for implementing the seven-hour workday system in various industrial sectors that have not yet shortened the working day, as well as in administrative, cultural, and health sectors. This is the preliminary labor fruit gained by the Soviet people in the Seven-Year Plan.
    The magnificent prospect of establishing a material production base for communism has aroused a new upsurge of labor enthusiasm among the Soviet people. Before the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a campaign to strive for the title of Communist Labor Brigade and Communist Labor Shock Worker was launched. This movement was carried out under the slogan "Work, study, and live in a communist way." Communist Labor Brigade members and certain workers who are striving for the title of Communist Labor Shock Worker have set themselves the task of: mastering production technology perfectly; systematically improving their educational and cultural-technical level; and adopting communist principles in dealing with relationships between people in production and life.
    The deeds of Kaganova, the captain of the fine spinning team of the Vishny Volochek cotton textile combine, are a vivid example of the new labor attitude. She voluntarily transferred from an advanced working team to a backward working team. She introduced her experience and knowledge to the members of this previously backward production team, thereby improving the work of this production team.
    Advanced workers in many enterprises in all industrial sectors have followed the example of Kaganova. Experienced personnel voluntarily go to work in backward collectives, making these collectives more organized, disciplined, and innovative. On this basis, the work of various production teams, work sections, and workshops in the enterprise has been improved, the organization of labor and production has been improved, and new methods have been found in increasing product production and improving product quality.
    The achievements of the Seven-Year Plan directly depend on the achievements of enterprises and construction, collective farms and state farms. The restructuring of production management and the Party's emphasis on enhancing the role of social organizations in production management have created the necessary conditions for the comprehensive development of mass creativity and initiative. The first year of the Seven-Year Plan marks the entry of socialist competition into a new period of upsurge. The strengthening of Party organizational activities and the initiatives of patriotic innovators and advanced producers have accelerated the Soviet Union's development towards a communist society.
    The Third Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, held at the end of October, summarized the achievements of the national economy this year and adopted the Soviet Union's National Economic Development Plan and the National Fiscal Budget for 1960. This plan stipulates that the total industrial output value of the Soviet Union in 1960 will increase by 8.1% compared with this year, which is higher than the indicator stipulated for next year in the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan. This plan shows that in 1960, the Soviet Union will take another big step forward in solving its main economic tasks and improving the people's living standards. The completion of the 1960 economic plan will lay a solid foundation for completing the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
    On the eve of the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet people have enthusiastically launched a socialist labor competition, determined to complete the first year of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it, and to prepare for the successful implementation of next year's economic plan. It can be predicted that the magnificent Seven-Year Plan can not only be completed, but also greatly overfulfilled. The achievements made by the Soviet people in the victorious implementation of the Seven-Year Plan have accelerated the pace of Soviet communist construction and strengthened the strength of the entire socialist camp, thereby making an important contribution to the struggle of the people of the world for lasting peace, democracy, and socialism.

    七年计划的雄伟步伐
    苏联  维·波加乔夫
    具有历史意义的苏共第二十一次代表大会标志着苏联进入了全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期。代表大会通过的1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的控制数字是一个以科学为基础的发展苏联社会主义社会并向共产主义道路前进的纲领。这个七年将是建立苏联共产主义的物质技术基础和建立整个社会主义阵营同资本主义阵营进行经济竞赛的物质技术基础的决定性阶段。
    全体进步人类都以极大的热忱迎接了七年计划的宏伟数字。全世界的劳动人民把七年计划控制数字看作是社会主义经济制度对资本主义经济制度根本优越性新的鲜明表现。
    有些资产阶级经济学家，像一贯的那样，怀疑这个新计划的现实性。他们一再证明，苏联和其他社会主义国家的经济在过去所以能高速度发展，是因为这些国家是从非常低的水平开始工业化的。而现在，当苏联已经成为工业产量占世界第二位的工业高度发达的强国时，它的进一步高速度发展，倒反而像是不可能的了。根据这些经济学家的意见，高速度不可避免是要降低的。
    实际情况怎样呢？
    现在的七年计划不只是一个纲领，它已经实行近一年了。苏联人民忘我的劳动，共产党的组织活动使苏联国民经济发展的新的巨大后备力量得到发掘并产生了作用。现在已经可以总结出计划执行的初步成果了。
    1959年前九个月的工业生产计划已全面地超额完成。同去年同期相比，前九个月的工业总产值增加了12％。各部门工业生产的增长速度都提高了。有一切根据可以假定，1959年的工业总产量将比去年增加11％以上（原计划规定为7.7％）。因此，到今年年底，苏联工业生产的超计划产品约为三百五十亿到四百亿卢布。
    “从七年计划的第一年的情况和1960年的预计看来，”赫鲁晓夫同志于9月24日在美国匹兹堡会见美国实业界和社会人士代表时说，“我们的工业生产将比原定计划有更大的增长。这样一来，据我们估计，七年计划提出的任务将超额完成，而计划将提前完成。”
    随着工业生产量的增长，劳动生产率的提高和工业产品成本的降低任务也超额完成了。头九个月工业中的劳动生产率提高了8％。因降低工业产品而得到的超计划节约，仅在上半年内就是四十亿卢布。
    弗拉基米尔城和斯维尔德洛夫斯克经济区的党组织和经济机关，在分析了各该地区企业增产的一切可能性后，制定了一些措施，这些措施使七年计划中所规定的生产水平可以在利用内部的后备力量而不需国家增加投资的情况下提前达到。列宁格勒工业企业的工人首先展开了提前完成七年计划劳动生产率水平的运动。第聂伯彼得罗夫斯克州的冶金工人和矿山工人保证提前两年在1963年达到七年计划规定的金属和煤炭的生产水平。莫斯科市国民经济委员会制定了动员厂内潜在力量的各项措施，这些措施为大量增加机床制造业产品提供了可能。为此而消耗的资金只占建设新企业所需要资金的一半。
    苏联共产党中央委员会六月全会关于工业和建设中技术进步的决议对工业生产的进一步改善产生了巨大的影响。这次全会可以说是苏共第二十一次代表大会的继续，它使代表大会在提高生产技术方面的决定具体化了，它总结了各个工业部门在争取技术进步中所积累的经验，指出了保证国民经济技术进步快速发展的一系列实际的组织措施。
    七年计划中农业生产的完成情况将由今年11月到12月召开的苏共中央全会进行审查。尽管今年许多地区的气候条件不好，但是谷物、甜菜等许多农作物的总收获量可望超过最近五年的年平均收获量，而棉花将获得丰收。今年冬播作物的播种计划超额完成了。
    生产的增长改善了苏联人民物质文化生活水平。从7月1日起，钟表、自行车、照相机、无线电工业的某些产品以及某些合成纤维制品的价格降低了。不久前，苏共中央、苏联部长会议和苏联工会中央通过了关于完成缩短工作日的过渡期限和调整职工工资的决定。决议规定在尚未缩短工作日的各个工业部门，以及行政、文化和卫生部门实行七小时工作日制的具体期限。这是苏联人民在七年计划中获得的初步劳动果实。
    建立共产主义物质生产基础的宏伟远景引起了苏联人民劳动热情的新高潮。在苏共二十一次代表大会以前，为争取共产主义劳动队和共产主义劳动突击手称号的运动展开了。这个运动是在“按共产主义方式工作、学习和生活”的口号下进行的。为争取共产主义劳动突击手称号的共产主义劳动队队员和某些工人给自己提出了任务：要完善地掌握生产技术；系统地提高教育和文化技术水平；在生产和生活中，采取共产主义原则对待人与人之间的关系。
    维什尼沃洛茨克棉纺联合企业精纺厂工作队长加干诺娃的事迹是新的劳动态度的鲜明榜样。她自愿从先进的工作队转到落后的工作队去工作。她向这个从前落后的生产队队员介绍了自己的经验和知识，从而改善了这个生产队的工作。
    所有工业部门的许多企业的先进工人都效法了加干诺娃的榜样。富有经验的工作人员主动地到落后的集体里去工作，使得这些集体更加具有组织性、纪律性和革新的精神。在这个基础上，企业里各个生产队、工段和车间的工作有了改进，劳动和生产组织有了改善，在增加产品生产及提高产品质量方面，找到了新的办法。
    七年计划的成就直接取决于企业和建设的成就、集体农庄和国营农场的成就。生产管理的改组，党关于提高社会组织在生产管理中的作用，为群众创造性和积极性的全面发展创造了必要条件。七年计划第一年意味着社会主义竞赛进入了一个新的高涨时期。党组织活动的加强，爱国主义革新家和先进生产者的创举加速了苏联向共产主义社会的发展。
    十月底举行的苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议总结了今年国民经济的成就，通过了1960年苏联发展国民经济计划和国家财政预算。这个计划规定，1960年苏联工业总产值将比今年增加8.1％，即高于七年计划控制数字中为明年规定的指标。这个计划表明，在1960年，苏联在解决它的主要经济任务和提高人民生活水平方面将再向前迈进一大步。1960年经济计划的完成，将为提前完成七年计划打下稳固的基础。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年前夕，苏联人民热情高涨地展开了社会主义劳动竞赛，决心提前和超额完成七年计划的第一年计划，并为胜利实现明年经济计划作好准备。可以预料，宏伟的七年计划不仅可以完成，而且可以大大超额完成。苏联人民在胜利地实现七年计划中取得的成就，加速了苏联共产主义建设的步伐，增强了整个社会主义阵营的力量，从而对于全世界人民争取持久和平、民主和社会主义的斗争作出了重要的贡献。
