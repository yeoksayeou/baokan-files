Editor's Note:

	More Pigs, More Manure, More Grain
	A formula is circulating among farmers: "More pigs - more manure - more grain - more pigs." Or, "Pigs, pigs - grain, grain; grain, grain - pigs, pigs." The meaning is: More pigs can promote the development of grain production; more grain can raise more pigs; with more pigs, there can be more grain. This formula clearly and accurately illustrates the relationship between raising pigs, accumulating manure, and increasing grain production. Raising a large number of pigs is the most important way for most parts of our country (except for some ethnic minority areas) to solve the fertilizer problem. To achieve the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical in fertilizer work, raising a large number of pigs is the only way.
	Pig manure is a kind of best farm manure, and the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium components contained in it are more than human manure. Pig manure is not only highly effective, but also abundant. According to statistics, a pig can accumulate about 8,000 to 10,000 jin of high-quality compost per year. According to experiments, generally speaking, 1,500 jin of compost can produce 100 jin of wheat, and 1,200 jin of compost can produce 100 jin of rice. According to this calculation, the fertilizer accumulated by a single pig can produce 500 to 600 jin of wheat or 800 to 900 jin of rice. That is to say, if one pig per mu is achieved, coupled with other yield-increasing measures, the yield of rice per mu can generally exceed 1,000 jin, and the yield of wheat per mu can generally reach about 600 to 700 jin. In addition, as everyone knows, raising more pigs can also increase the income of the commune and its members, and also increase the supply of meat. The news published in this newspaper today about the Xinxing Production Team's Second Team and the Kuixingzhuang Production Team developing pig raising, promoting agricultural production increase and increasing income, is a powerful factual proof.

### 猪多　肥多　粮多

    猪多　肥多　粮多
    农民中流传着一个公式：“猪多——肥多——粮多——猪多。”或者说：“猪猪——粮粮；粮粮——猪猪。”意思就是说：猪多了，可以促进粮食生产的发展；粮食多了，又可以更多养猪；猪更多了，粮食就可以更多。这个公式很明白很确切地说明了养猪积肥和增产粮食的关系。大量养猪，是我国绝大部分地区（一部分少数民族地区除外）解决肥料问题的最重要的途径。要在肥料工作中实现多快好省的要求，大量养猪是必由之路。
    猪粪尿是一种最好的农家肥料，所含氮磷钾成分比人粪尿还多些。猪粪尿不仅肥效高，数量也多。据统计，一头猪一年大约可以积制优质厩肥八千斤到一万斤左右。根据试验，一般地说，用一千五百斤厩肥可以生产小麦一百斤，用一千二百斤厩肥可以生产稻谷一百斤。依此计算，单是一头猪所积的肥料，就能生产五、六百斤小麦或者八、九百斤稻谷。也就是说，如果实现了一亩地一头猪以后，配合上其它增产措施，稻谷亩产量就可以普遍超过千斤，小麦亩产量也可以普遍达到六、七百斤左右。此外，谁也知道，多多养猪还可以增加公社和社员的收入，同时也可以增加肉食供应。本报今天发表的新兴生产队二小队和魁星庄生产队发展养猪事业，促进农业增产和增加收入的消息，就是有力的事实证明。
