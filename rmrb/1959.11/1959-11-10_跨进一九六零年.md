    Stepping into 1960
    The Xiangshan Iron Mine in Yantai, Shandong, which was born in the Great Leap Forward last year, has completed its annual plan 65 days ahead of schedule.
    The Xiangshan Iron Mine began construction in April of last year. At that time, only a few cadres led seventeen workers in prospecting, mining, and production, using iron hammers, picks, and small carts to produce ore. With the vigorous development of the nationwide steelmaking campaign, the daily output increased from a few tons to several hundred tons by the end of last year. In a few months, nearly 100,000 tons of mining and panning were completed.
    Since the beginning of this year, under the leadership of the Party Committee, this mine has launched a vigorous technical innovation campaign, with everyone contributing ideas and suggestions, enabling more than 90% of the workers to put down heavy tools such as carrying baskets, small carts, and hand hammers, and production has gradually become mechanized. The daily ore production level in the second and third quarters increased by 150% compared to the first quarter, and the ore cost decreased by 51%.

    跨进一九六零年
    在去年大跃进中诞生的山东烟台祥山铁矿，已经提前六十五天完成了全年计划。
    祥山铁矿是在去年4月开始建矿的。当时只是几个干部带领十七名工人边勘采、边生产，用铁锤、镐头和小车生产矿石。随着全民大办钢铁运动的蓬勃发展，至去年年底日产量已由几吨增加到几百吨，在几个月的时间内，采矿、淘矿近十万吨。
    今年以来，这个矿在党委领导下，开展了轰轰烈烈的技术革新运动，人人献计献策，使90％以上的工人放下抬筐、小车、手锤等笨重工具，生产逐步走上土机械化。第二、三季度的日产矿石水平比一季度提高了150％，矿石成本降低了51％。
