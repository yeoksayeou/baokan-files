    Clever Weaver Girl

    In the Tianjin No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill, people affectionately call Sun Guizhen a "clever weaver girl."

    Sun Guizhen is a young and outstanding loom operator. Over the past decade, she has not only completed and exceeded the state plan every year, but also created a record of not producing substandard cloth for four years and one month.

    In 1954, she once bought a jacket with a noticeable flaw on the shoulder. She felt very uneasy, thinking that this flaw was woven by a weaving worker, perhaps even by herself, because at that time she often produced substandard cloth. Driven by this high sense of responsibility, she was determined to reduce and eliminate substandard cloth, and humbly learn from others.

    She used her spare time to learn, and even looked for people to learn from on Sundays. She kept thinking of ways in production, and began to create the record of continuous zero substandard cloth production. In 1956, the factory made further demands on the specifications of substandard cotton cloth, requiring no yarn slivers on the cloth surface. How to prevent yarn slippage? Initially, the workshop used scissors to cut, but this method was difficult, too busy, and easy to poke large holes in the cloth surface. She consulted Chen Wanzhong, a member of the Party branch committee and the production team leader. Chen Wanzhong encouraged her to think boldly and experiment boldly. She figured out that the yarn tail of the spare shuttle should not be left too long (there were no restrictions before), not exceeding the length of the shuttle body, and the rotten yarn should be removed. This way, the yarn tail was smooth, solving the key problem of yarn tails on the cloth surface, and maintaining the record of no substandard cloth. In the first quarter of 1957, they encountered a batch of bad yarn. Some people in the workshop had to produce two pieces of substandard cloth a day. At mealtime, someone said: "It would be a miracle to produce no substandard cloth with this kind of yarn!" She also felt it was really difficult and scared. After more than two years of not producing substandard cloth, if she didn't think of a way now, she wouldn't be able to maintain the record. She painstakingly researched and improved methods such as checking the cloth surface. Originally, she only checked the cloth surface once. After analyzing it, she realized that checking the cloth surface meant the eyes and hands followed, and many places could not be checked in one pass, so she added another pass, checking from the bottom up, overcoming the difficulties, and producing no substandard cloth. In June 1958, the leadership stipulated a system of not dismantling substandard cloth, which had never happened before, and was even more difficult than not producing substandard cloth. Comrade Gu Honglin, the secretary of the Party general branch, said to her: "Implementing the system of not dismantling substandard cloth is a major innovation in the textile industry, and its significance is great... An advanced producer, a Communist Party member, must overcome difficulties in the face of difficulties." In July, she carefully summarized the experience of fighting against various defects over the years, and according to the requirements of high speed and the frequent occurrence of skipped stitches and skipped yarn, she explored the experience of five checks to prevent defects (check the warp beam, check the weft yarn, check the cloth surface and weave, check the shuttle, check the leather knot). In August, she still maintained the record of no substandard cloth for the whole month. In order to explore operating methods suitable for high-speed conditions, she studied the production problems of the day every night, and when her mother and sisters were asleep, she quietly got up and used the room as a workshop, assuming the cloth surface of twelve looms, and studied how to patrol. The next day, she discussed with everyone and carefully observed and learned from other people's actions. With the help of the Party and everyone, she and her comrades finally figured out the rules, improved on the basis of the 1951 weaving work method, and summarized specific operating experience suitable for high-speed conditions. After mastering this operating experience, her ability to look after looms increased from ten to twelve, the shift output increased from 31.21 yards to 39.7 yards, and at the same time, the first-class product rate of the finished product increased from 95.59% to 98.96%.

    巧织女
    在天津国棉二厂，人们亲切地称孙桂珍是一位“巧织女”。
    孙桂珍是一个年轻的出色的挡车工。十年来，她不但逐年完成和超额完成了国家计划，而且创造了四年零一个月不出次布的成绩。
    1954年，有一回她买了一件上衣，肩膀有一块明显的残疵。她心里很不安，她想这块残疵是织布工人织的，说不定就是自己织的，因为这时她还常常出次布。在这种高度的责任感下，她下决心减少次布，消灭次布，虚心向别人学习。
    她利用业余时间学，星期天也去找人学，在生产中不断想办法，开始创造连续不出次布了。到了1956年，厂里对棉布的次布规格作了进一步的要求，布面上要求没有一点纱条。怎样做到不溜纱呢？开始时车间里都是用剪刀剪，这个方法困难多，忙不过来，也容易在布面上戳大窟窿。她找党支部委员、生产组长陈万忠研究。陈万忠鼓励她大胆想大胆试验，她摸出了预备梭的纱尾不要留的太长（原来没有限制），不超过梭身长，烂纱摘掉，这样纱尾挺顺，解决了布面有纱尾的关键问题，保持了不出次布。1957年第一季度，遇上一批不好的纱。车间里有人一天要出两匹次布。吃饭时有人说：“用这种纱不出次布，那真是神仙！”她听了也真觉得有困难，心里也害怕，二年多没出次布，现在如不想办法，就不能保持不出次布了。她苦苦研究改进查布面等方法。她原来只查一趟布面。她分析了一下，查布面是眼跟手走，查一趟有许多地方查不到，就增加一次，从底下往上查，克服了困难，不出次布。1958年6月，领导上规定了不拆次布制度，这是从来没有过的事儿，要比不出次布困难更多。党总支书记顾鸿麟同志对她说：“实行不拆次布了，这是纺织工业一大革新，它的意义很大……一个先进生产者，一个共产党员，要在困难中克服困难。”7月份，她仔细总结了几年来向各种残疵进行斗争的经验，并根据高速化的要求及经常出现跳花跳纱现象，摸索出预防残疵的五查（查经轴、查纬纱、查布面织口、查梭子、查皮结）的经验。8月份，她依然保持全月不出次布的纪录。为了摸索适合高速条件的操作方法，当时她每天夜里研究当天生产问题，等妈妈、妹妹都睡下了，悄悄爬起来，把屋里当车间，假设十二台布机的布面，研究如何巡回。第二天和大家共同研究，仔细观察学习别人的动作。由于党和大家的帮助，她和同志们终于摸到了规律，在1951织布工作法的基础上加以改进，总结出适合高速化条件下的具体操作经验。掌握这个操作经验以后，她的看台能力从十台增到十二台，台班产量由三十一点二一码提高到三十九点七码，同时，下机一等品率由95.59％提高到98.96％。
