    Red Flag Planted on the Altai Plateau
    At the National Conference of Heroes and Advanced Collectives of the Metallurgical System for Experience Exchange, the representatives from the First Mine of the Altai Plateau in Xinjiang were warmly welcomed and drew great attention.
    The First Mine is located on a high mountain nearly three thousand meters above sea level. For two-thirds of the year, it is snow-covered, and the climate is extremely cold. Since August, all the ethnic groups of workers and staff of the mine have warmly responded to the call of the Central Committee to "oppose rightist tendencies, boost morale, and vigorously increase production and practice thrift," overcoming the difficulties of natural conditions and completing this year's production plan in an all-round and overfulfilled manner 105 days ahead of schedule. In the red flag competition to complete the annual plan ahead of schedule, the mine's production records have been constantly refreshed, and new people and new deeds have emerged continuously. The shift efficiency of rock drillers has increased from 30 meters at the beginning of the year to 96 meters, 177.7 meters, and a maximum of 212.4 meters. The efficiency of pushcart workers has increased from 30 large carts per shift to 60 large carts, with a maximum of 221 large carts.

    红旗插在阿尔泰高原
    在全国群英会冶金系统经验交流会议上，来自新疆阿尔泰高原第一矿场的代表受到了大家的热烈欢迎和关注。
    第一矿场在拔海近三千米的高山上，全年有三分之二的时间被大雪封山，气候非常寒冷。8月份以来，全矿各族职工热烈响应中央“反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约”的号召，战胜了自然条件的困难，以提前一百零五天全面超额完成了今年生产计划。在为提前完成年计划的红旗竞赛中，这个矿的生产纪录不断刷新，新人新事不断涌现。风钻工的台班效率由年初的三十米提高到九十六米、一百七十七点七米，最高达到二百一十二点四米；推车工由台班推三十大车提高到推六十大车，最高达到二百二十一大车。
