Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 11th November: The two million mu of double-cropping late rice in Shangrao Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, has yielded a bumper harvest. The unit area yield has increased by nearly 20% compared to last year, and the total output has increased by 1.3 times.

Shangrao Prefecture has 70% of its area in mountainous regions, with the remainder being hilly land and low-lying lakefront plains. Autumn is often dry with little rain, and natural conditions are unfavorable for late rice growth, resulting in historically low yields for double-cropping late rice. This year, under the leadership of the Party, the prefecture fully utilized the superiority of the People's Communes. Before the early rice harvest, the Shangrao Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed expanding the double-cropping late rice plan, mobilizing the people of the entire region to strive for a bumper harvest of double-cropping late rice.

To ensure a successful harvest of double-cropping late rice, much of which was planted in infertile fields, after the transplanting of seedlings, each commune's production team immediately established specialized teams to strengthen field management of double-cropping late rice. In Yugan County, each commune uniformly allocated labor, organizing a 10,000-person field management specialized force, implementing a "three-fixed" responsibility system of "fixed personnel, fixed fields, fixed rewards and punishments," specializing in cultivating and managing the county's more than 200,000 mu of double-cropping late rice. In Wuyuan County, 5,000 cadres and commune members lived near the low-yield fields with their cattle, weeding and topdressing fertilizer, focusing on upgrading the Grade III seedlings of the double-cropping late rice. In Yushan County, each commune promoted the method of "pigsties going up the mountains," establishing more than 500 pig farms near the low-yield fields, raising more than 80,000 fattened pigs, specifically to accumulate fine fertilizer for Grade III seedlings. Through the upgrading movement of rice seedlings, 400,000 mu of Grade III seedlings in the region were transformed into Grade I seedlings within half a month, essentially eliminating Grade III seedlings.

During the growth period of double-cropping late rice, Shangrao Prefecture experienced fifty days without rainfall. People's Communes at all levels promptly organized a large number of laborers to combat drought and rescue the double-cropping late rice. In Guixi, Yugan, Poyang, Yujiang, Leping, and Dongxiang counties, where drought affected 80% of the total area, from leading cadres to the masses, 500,000 people were投入into the fight against drought. In Leping County, 100,000 people waged a major battle against the drought: wherever there was water, waterwheels were erected; they climbed mountains to find water sources; they dug wells on flat ground; they built dams across streams; they built long aqueducts, achieving "every water source irrigating fields, every drop of water being used," enabling the county's 77,000 mu of drought-stricken double-cropping late rice fields to escape the drought and secure a bumper harvest.

    上饶专区晚稻增产一倍多
    据新华社南昌11日电  江西上饶专区二百万亩双季晚稻丰收。单位面积产量比去年增长了将近两成；总产量增加了一点三倍。
    上饶专区有70％的面积是山区，其余是丘陵地和地势低洼的湖滨平原，秋季缺雨多旱，自然条件不利晚稻生长，历年双季晚稻的产量很低。今年这个专区在党的领导下，充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，早在早稻收割之前，中共上饶地委就提出了扩大双季晚稻的计划，动员全区人民为争取双季晚稻丰收而奋斗。
    为了使大部分种植在瘦田上的双季晚稻丰收，在插秧结束后，各公社生产队就立即成立专业队，加强双季晚稻的田间管理工作。余干县各公社统一调配劳力，组织了一支万人的田间管理专业队伍，实行“定人员、定田亩、定奖惩”的“三定”责任制度，专门培育管理全县二十多万亩双季晚稻。婺源县各公社有五千名干部、社员带着耕牛住在低产田边，耘田、追肥，围攻双季晚稻的三类苗。玉山县各公社推行“猪栏上山”的办法，在低产田旁建立了五百多个养猪场，饲养肥猪八万多头，专门为三类苗积造精肥。经过禾苗升级运动，半个月内全区有四十万亩三类苗变成了一类苗，基本消灭了三类苗。
    在双季晚稻生长期间，上饶专区有五十天没有降雨，各地人民公社及时组织了大批劳动力，抗旱抢救双季晚稻。受旱面积占总面积80％的贵溪、余干、波阳、余江、乐平、东乡等县，从领导干部到群众，五十万人投入了抗旱斗争。乐平县十万人大战干旱：遇水架水车，登山找水源，平地打水井，逢溪筑水坝，广搭渡水槽，做到“万水灌田、滴水皆用”，使全县七万七千亩受旱的双季晚稻田摆脱了干旱，保住了丰收。
