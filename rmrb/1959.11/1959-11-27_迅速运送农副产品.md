    Rapidly Transporting Agricultural and Sideline Products
    By People's Daily Commentator
    The current production and procurement of agricultural and sideline products are in excellent condition, and the mass movement of "Minor Autumn Harvest" for wild plant materials is also deepening. After the agricultural and sideline products and wild plant materials are purchased, the transportation problem immediately follows. This year's procurement volume of agricultural and sideline products is large and concentrated in time. The transportation link must keep up closely to ensure the raw material supply for light industry, further arrange the market and export needs, and ensure the complete victory of the procurement movement.
    To this end, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, commercial departments in various regions must cooperate with transportation departments to further deepen the mass movement of short-distance transportation of agricultural and sideline products; strengthen material transfer work; and comprehensively carry out incidental transportation. These are several key issues in the current transportation of agricultural and sideline products.
    Short-distance transportation is an extremely important component of the entire transportation front and a gateway for material collection and distribution. If this gateway is not cleared, it will affect production, procurement, and supply. In continuing the mass movement of short-distance transportation, commercial departments must rely on the leadership of the Party Committee, cooperate with transportation departments, help people's communes and production teams consolidate, improve, and develop professional and sideline transportation teams, strengthen transportation organization work, and tap the potential of folk transportation tools to achieve a combination of regular transportation and emergency transportation, professional transportation and sideline transportation. Many wild plant materials grow in mountainous areas, forest areas, and grasslands. Only by transporting these products can "dead treasures" be turned into "living treasures." Commercial departments in various regions need to seize the current favorable opportunity, taking advantage of the high tide of mass movements such as agricultural and sideline product procurement, "Minor Autumn Harvest," and short-distance transportation, and strive to transport the products that have been purchased to processing plants, warehouses, or transportation lines in a timely manner to ensure scheduled transportation to their destinations.
    Agricultural and sideline products generally go through two or more transfers from dispersion to concentration. The transfer work is in a pivotal position in the entire commercial storage and transportation work. The quality of this work has a great impact on the speed of material transfer, the rationality of transportation capacity utilization, the connection between long-distance and short-distance transportation plans, the amount of expenses, and the quality of commodity storage and preservation. Commercial departments in various regions must pay attention to this work, not only to organize the connection between long-distance and short-distance transportation, but also to properly store the products to be transported, and do everything possible to prevent undue losses of products during transportation. In this regard, Jiangxi Province has very good experience in transfer work. They have established three-level storage and transportation stations at the provincial, special district, and county levels in key transportation routes to carry out transfer work. The county storage and transportation stations are connected to the special district storage and transportation stations, and the special district storage and transportation stations are connected to the provincial storage and transportation stations, initially forming a storage and transportation network covering the entire province. They also adopted the method of "unified planning, centralized leadership, three-level management, separate accounting, and integration of storage and transportation." This is an experience worthy of universal promotion.
    The situation on China's transportation front this year is also extremely good, and the volume of material transportation has increased significantly compared with the same period last year. However, from the perspective of the requirements of industry, agriculture, and commerce, transportation capacity is still difficult to fully meet the needs. Incidental transportation is one of the most effective ways to unleash transportation potential. Commercial, railway, and transportation departments in various regions have achieved success in utilizing returning, empty, and underloaded vehicles and ships. However, the potential in this area is still great. As long as we strengthen the organization and leadership of this work and further strengthen cooperation, we can tap more potential and better comprehensively arrange material transportation. The commercial department of Guizhou Province cooperates with railway, highway, and shipping departments to comprehensively carry out incidental transportation. They have established incidental transportation relationships with thirty-two government agencies, factories, and mining enterprises, and have also established more than two hundred incidental transportation points. From April to September this year, highway and shipping alone incidentally transported more than 293,000 tons of agricultural and sideline products. This is an experience worthy of attention in organizing incidental transportation.
    The agricultural and sideline product procurement movement has now entered a decisive period for winning a complete victory. We hope that the vast number of employees in the commercial and transportation departments in various regions, under the leadership of the Party, will thoroughly criticize right-leaning ideas, muster their energy, do everything possible to support the agricultural and sideline product procurement movement, and ensure the completion and strive to overfulfill the transportation tasks of agricultural and sideline products.

    迅速运送农副产品
    本报评论员
    目前农副产品的生产和收购情况都很好，大搞野生植物原料的“小秋收”运动也正在深入开展。农副产品和野生植物原料收购起来以后，紧接着就是运输问题。今年的农副产品收购量大，时间集中，运输这一环必须紧紧跟上，才能保证轻工业的原料供应，保证进一步安排好市场与出口需要，保证收购运动获得全胜。
    为此，各地商业部门必须在党委统一领导下，协同交通运输部门进一步深入开展农副产品短途运输的群众运动；加强物资中转工作；全面开展捎脚运输。这是当前农副产品运输中几个带有关键性的问题。
    短途运输是整个交通战线上一个极为重要的组成部分，也是物资集散的一个关口，如果这一关通不过，不论对生产、收购和供应，都会发生影响。在继续开展短途运输的群众运动中，商业部门必须依靠党委的领导，协同交通运输部门，帮助人民公社和生产队巩固、提高和发展专业和副业运输队伍，加强运输组织工作，挖掘民间运输工具的潜力，做到经常运输与突击运输、专业运输与副业运输相结合。许多野生植物原料生长在山区、林区和草地，要把这些产品运输出来，“死宝”才能变成“活宝”。各地商业部门需要抓住当前的有利时机，趁农副产品收购、“小秋收”和短途运输等群众运动的高潮，力争把已经收购起来的产品及时运到加工厂、仓库或交通沿线，以保证按计划调运到目的地。
    农副产品从分散到集中，一般要经过两个或两个以上的中转过程。中转工作在整个商业储运工作中处于枢纽地位。这一工作的好坏，对物资调运的快慢、运力使用合理与否、长途短途运输计划的衔接、费用大小、商品储存保管好坏等，都有很大影响。各地商业部门必须重视这一工作，既要组织好长途和短途运输的衔接，又要妥善保管好待运的产品，千方百计地不使产品在运输过程中发生不应有的损失。在这方面，江西省的中转工作经验很好。他们在交通要道建立了省、专区、县三级储运站，进行中转工作。县储运站与专区储运站连接，专区储运站又与省储运站连接，初步形成了一个全省范围的储运网。他们还采取了“统一规划、集中领导、三级管理、分别核算、储运合一”的办法。这是值得普遍推广的经验。
    今年我国运输战线的形势也是极为良好的，物资运量比去年同期有较大的增长。但从工业、农业和商业的要求来看，运输力仍难完全满足需要。捎脚运输是发挥运输潜力的最有效的办法之一。各地商业、铁道和交通运输部门对利用回空、排空和载重不足的车船，做得有成绩。但是这方面的潜力还很大，只要加强对这一工作的组织领导，进一步密切协作，就能挖掘出更多的潜力，更好地全面安排物资运输。贵州省商业部门与铁路、公路、航运部门协作，全面开展捎脚运输。他们和三十二个机关、厂矿企业建立了捎脚运输的关系，还建立了二百多个捎运点。今年4月到9月间，仅公路和航运即捎运了农副产品二十九万三千余吨，这是组织捎脚运输中值得重视的经验。
    目前农副产品收购运动已进入争取全胜的决定性时期，我们希望各地商业和交通运输部门的广大职工，在党的领导下，反透右倾、鼓足干劲，千方百计支援农副产品收购运动，保证完成和力争超额完成农副产品的运输任务。
