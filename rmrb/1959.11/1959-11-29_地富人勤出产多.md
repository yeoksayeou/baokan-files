Industries are Established on "Treasure Bowls"

In the grasslands of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, such as Xilin Gol, Ordos, and Hulunbuir, salt lakes and alkali lakes are densely distributed. According to statistics, there are nearly three hundred salt lakes of various sizes in the region. Among them, the larger Jilantai Salt Lake has extremely abundant salt reserves.

Alkali lakes are concentrated on the Ordos grassland surrounded by the Yellow River, where there are more than seventy large and small lakes rich in natural alkali.

Since the establishment of the Autonomous Region, the emerging salt and alkali industry has been booming on these treasure bowls.

More than twenty new salt fields have been built throughout the region. On the shores of salt lakes such as Jilantai and Yaburai, which previously only had a dozen or so earthen houses, eighteen factories have sprung up to process and manufacture chemical raw materials such as anhydrous sodium sulfate. On the salt ponds of various places, where there were only a few manual workers and camel tracks, new scenes of busy traffic and rows of houses have appeared.

Although the natural alkali in Inner Mongolia was mined as early as the end of the Qing Dynasty, the region's output was only three thousand tons by 1949. This year, Inner Mongolia's natural alkali has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest.

Diverse Leather Products

The leather production industry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is thriving. Now, leather factories throughout the region are using the abundant hides of cattle, horses, pigs, and other livestock in the area to produce a wide variety of leather products. From steelmaking shoes, leather goods, and leather accessories to leather clothing, leather suitcases, leather shoes, riding boots, and leather gloves, there are no fewer than hundreds of varieties, truly diverse and comprehensive.

The annual output of heavy and light leather in Inner Mongolia this year has increased from more than 4,000 tons at the time of the establishment of the Autonomous Region to more than 30,000 tons. The physical and chemical indicators of the produced sole and surface leather have reached the national requirements.

Splendid Carpets

As early as a hundred years ago, folk artisans in Kulun Banner, Hailar, and other places in Inner Mongolia used their skillful hands to weave carpets using wool from the grasslands. However, the scale was very small, with only two hundred people employed. After liberation, with the strong support of the government, five large-scale carpet factories with an annual output of more than 1,000 square meters have been established throughout the region. The number of people employed in the carpet industry throughout the region has increased to more than 2,500.

Inner Mongolian carpets have a unique style. Carpet factories in Hohhot, Chifeng, Xilinhot, and other places use novel and colorful patterns such as "Spring on the Grassland," "Ancient Great Wall," "Grassland Scenery," and "Endless Herds of Sheep" to weave durable and colorful splendid carpets.

Grassland Sugar

Baotou Sugar Factory, one of the major sugar factories in northern China, has produced a total of more than 67,000 tons of sugar from sugar beets (sugar radishes) in the past four years. Now, the fifth production period has begun. In the past month alone, it has produced more than 9,000 tons of white sugar.

This large-scale modern mechanized sugar factory, which processes 1,000 tons of sugar beets per day, produces "Grassland" brand sugar, which is white and crystalline, of excellent quality, and has a sugar content of over 99.8%. It is a nutritious seasoning loved by people everywhere. The sugar beet stems, leaves, and waste silk left after sugar production are also good livestock feed.

With the planting area of sugar beets expanding year by year, the prospects for the development of the sugar industry in Inner Mongolia are bright. At present, two medium-sized mechanized sugar factories are being rushed to completion in Hohhot and Tongliao respectively. Next year, the output of mechanized sugar in the entire Autonomous Region will more than double.

Dairy Products

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which has more than one million dairy cows, is making great efforts to develop the dairy industry by utilizing its abundant milk source.

The quality of Inner Mongolia's dairy industrial products is generally very good. There are edible butter, milk powder, and milk soy sauce, as well as casein, which is supplied to plastic factories for making buttons, decorations, and insulators. There is also lactose, which is extracted from milk and is the main raw material for pharmaceutical factories to manufacture valuable medicines such as penicillin and glucose. It is now sold throughout the country.

Licorice Extract Tops the Nation

Inner Mongolia, which ranks first in the country in terms of licorice resources, produces a large amount of licorice extract every year, providing hundreds of factories at home and abroad for the production of medicines, candies, cigarettes, and other products.

Hohhot Pharmaceutical Factory is a factory that produces licorice extract. In 1958, the output of licorice extract reached one million kilograms, an increase of more than eight times compared to 1953. The product quality has been continuously improved, exceeding the standards stipulated in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and the export standards. Significant achievements have been made in reducing moisture, water-insoluble matter, alcohol-insoluble matter, and increasing oxalic acid content, making it a traditional commodity that sells well in the international market.

    地富人勤出产多
    “聚宝盆”上办工业
    在内蒙古自治区的锡林郭勒、鄂尔多斯、呼伦贝尔等草原上，盐湖密布，碱湖遍地。据统计，全区共有大、小盐湖近三百个，其中比较大的吉蓝泰盐湖，现有盐的储藏量极为丰富。
    碱湖集中在黄河环抱的鄂尔多斯草原上，这里共有盛产天然碱的大、小湖泊七十多个。
    自治区成立后，新兴的盐碱工业正在这些聚宝盆上蓬勃发展起来。
    全区新建的盐场已有二十多个。在过去只有十几间土房子的吉蓝泰、雅布赖等盐湖湖畔，出现了十八座加工制造无水芒硝等化工原料的工厂。过去只有少数手工工人和骆驼脚迹的各地盐池上，出现了车水马龙、房舍林立的新景。
    内蒙古的天然碱，虽然远在清朝末年就已开采，但直到1949年，全区产量只有三千吨。今年，内蒙古的天然碱，获得了空前大丰收。

    多种多样的皮革制品
    内蒙古自治区的皮革生产事业蒸蒸日上。现在，全自治区各地皮革厂利用区内富饶的牛、马、猪等牲畜皮张，已生产出多种多样的皮革制品。从炼钢鞋、皮件、皮具到皮衣、皮箱、皮鞋、马靴、皮手套等，不下数百种，可谓五花八门，应有尽有。
    内蒙古今年重革、轻革年产量，已由自治区成立时的四千多吨提高到三万多吨。生产的底面革物理化学指标已达到国家规定要求。
    锦绣地毯
    远在一百年前，内蒙古库伦旗、海拉尔等地民间手工艺人，就用灵巧的双手，采用草原上的羊毛织制地毯。不过，规模很小，从业人员只有二百人。解放后，经过政府大力扶助，全区已建立年产一千平方米以上的大型地毯厂五座。全区地毯业从业人员增加到二千五百多人。
    内蒙古地毯具有独特的风格。呼和浩特、赤峰、锡林浩特等地地毯厂，采用“草原之春”、“古长城”、“草原风月”、“羊群无边”等新颖多彩的图案，织出了经久耐用五彩缤纷的锦绣地毯。
    草原砂糖
    北方地区主要糖厂之一——包头糖厂，四年来利用甜菜（糖萝卜）制糖总产量已达六万七千多吨。现在，第五个生产期开始了。最近一个多月即生产了九千多吨白砂糖。
    这座日处理甜菜一千吨的大型现代化机制糖厂，出产的草原牌砂糖，色白结晶，质量优良，糖度在99.8％以上，是各地人民喜爱的富有养分的调味品。它制糖后剩下的甜菜茎叶和废丝，又是良好的牲畜饲料。
    随着甜菜种植面积逐年扩大，内蒙古制糖工业发展前途远大。目前，呼和浩特市和通辽市正在分别赶建两座中型机制糖厂。明年全自治区机制糖产量将猛增一倍以上。
    乳制品
    拥有一百多万头乳牛的内蒙古自治区，利用充足的乳源，大兴乳品工业。
    内蒙古乳制工业品，一般质量很好，有供食用的奶油、乳粉、牛奶酱油，也有提供塑料工厂制作钮扣、装饰品、绝缘器使用的酪胶。还有一种从牛奶里提炼出来的乳糖，是医药工厂制造青霉素、葡萄糖等贵重药品的主要原料，现已遍销全国各地。
    甘草膏居全国之冠
    甘草资源占全国首位的内蒙古，每年生产大量甘草膏，提供国内外数百个工厂制作药品、糖果、卷烟等使用。
    呼和浩特制药厂是生产甘草膏的工厂。1958年甘草膏产量达一百万公斤，比1953年增长八倍多。产品质量不断提高，超过了我国药典规定的标准和出口标准；在降低水分、水不溶物、酒精不溶物和提高草酸成分等方面有很大成绩，是我国在国际市场上畅销的传统性商品。（附图片）
