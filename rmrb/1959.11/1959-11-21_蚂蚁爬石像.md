	"Ants Climbing a Statue"
	Shao Xin
	Comrade Mao Dun wrote an essay entitled "Ants Climbing a Statue" more than twenty years ago. The content is roughly as follows: A sculptor created a marble statue of a woman and displayed it in an exhibition. People praised it when they saw it, saying, "Beautiful! Venus has come to the world!" They all felt that if there was such a thing as "beauty" in the world, this was it. But at the same time, two ants crawled over this beautiful work of art, and their feelings were completely different from those of humans. They felt that climbing on the uneven and curvy stone statue was much more difficult than walking on flat ground, and whenever they were trapped between two "peaks," they could not see the road ahead. All they saw before them was a "difficult to cross, sky-high mountain." Where was there any "beauty" to be found?

	From this, it can be seen that those who can see the whole thing feel the beauty of the statue, while ants, unable to see the whole thing, think that the statue is just an ordinary, even clumsy, stone. It is truly: "Only those who can see the whole can recognize objective reality."

	The story of ants climbing a statue is a kind of allegory. All allegories generally have a value that transcends time. Sure enough, we can still see people and things like ants climbing statues today.

	I am talking about those right-leaning opportunists. When we are rejoicing over the brilliant achievements of the General Line and the great victories of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes, their feelings and views are different from ours. When they see a small blast furnace consuming a little more coal, they will shout, "The Great Leap Forward in steel is not worth the loss!" When they see a temporary confusion in a certain people's commune or a few times when a public canteen fails to prepare breakfast well, they shout, "The people's communes are a mess!" As for the achievements of the great development of industry and agriculture since the People's Communes and the Great Leap Forward movement, they do not want to see them. These people are just like ants crawling on a beautiful marble statue, thinking that their "views are brilliant," but in reality, they are just ants!

	Man's volume in the universe is small, much smaller than that of an ant compared to a statue. However, ants are insects, and we are "people"; ants cannot see what we can see. As long as we stand tall and see far, and our eyes are not limited to the few ounces of pork and cigarettes under our noses, we can see the whole and recognize objective reality. A person is also small in relation to the entire social life, especially today, a person is even smaller in relation to the great socialist and communist cause led by the Party, and to the mass revolutionary movement in which millions of people participate. But the great Party and people with a communist outlook on life and a strong revolutionary will can correctly and comprehensively recognize objective reality and can make a correct evaluation of the mass revolutionary movement, that is, the General Line is very good, the Great Leap Forward is very good, and the People's Communes are very good!

	Since the People's Communes and the Great Leap Forward, the working people of our country are starting to sculpt the motherland into a socialist and communist giant statue. Although this giant statue is still in the process of being sculpted and is not a perfect work of art, its vivid and bright overall picture has already been displayed before the people. Only those who are accustomed to making arbitrary judgments and uttering wild opinions on our social life with the feelings and viewpoints of ants climbing a statue will insist that it is a clumsy stone. Then, let them become miserable creatures even smaller than ants!

    “蚂蚁爬石像”
    邵辛
    茅盾同志在二十多年以前曾写过一篇题为“蚂蚁爬石像”的散文。内容大体是这样的：雕刻家创作了一尊大理石女像，陈列在展览会中，人们见了都称赞道：“美啊！维娜斯到了人世！”他们都觉得天地之间如果有所谓“美”，那么，这便是。但同时有两只蚂蚁从这美丽的艺术品上爬过，它们的感觉却与人完全不同了。它们觉得在那高低不平、众多曲线的石像上爬行，比之平地要费力得不知多少倍，而且每当身陷于两个“高峰”之间时，就无法看见前面的道路，耸立在眼前的只是一座“难以越过的高入云空的大山”，哪里有一点儿“美”呢？
    由此可见，能见全体的人就感到石像的美，不能看到全体的蚂蚁，就以为石像只不过是一块平常的，甚至是拙劣的石头。真是：“惟能见全体者为能认识客观的真实。”
    蚂蚁爬石像的故事，算得一种寓言。凡寓言，大抵总是有超越时间的价值的。果然，现在我们也还可以见到同蚂蚁爬石像一样的人和事。
    我说的就是那些右倾机会主义分子。当我们为总路线的辉煌成就和大跃进和人民公社的巨大胜利欢欣鼓舞的时候，他们的感觉和看法却与我们不同。当他们在某一个小高炉旁看到多费了一点煤炭就会大叫道：“大炼钢铁是得不偿失！”当他们看到某一个人民公社里曾经出现过暂时的忙乱或某一公共食堂里几次没有作好早炊就大喊着：“人民公社糟得很！”至于人民公社和大跃进运动以来工农业大发展的成就，他们是不想看到的。这些人正像爬在美丽的大理石塑像上，自以为“见解高明”，其实，蚂蚁而已！
    人在宇宙中的体积是渺小的，这较之蚂蚁比塑像还要渺小得多。然而蚂蚁是昆虫，我们是“人”；蚂蚁无法看到的，我们能够看到。只要站得高看得远，眼光不局限于自己鼻子下的几两猪肉和几支纸烟，这就能见到全体，认识客观的真实。一个人对于整个的社会生活来说也是渺小的，尤其是今天，一个人对于党所领导的伟大的社会主义、共产主义事业，对于在这个事业中千百万人参加的群众革命运动就更加渺小了。但伟大的党和具有共产主义的人生观、坚强的革命意志的人，能够正确地、全面地认识客观真实，能够给群众的革命运动作出正确的评价，那就是总路线好得很，大跃进好得很，人民公社好得很！
    自从人民公社和大跃进以来，我们国家的劳动人民正在着手把祖国雕塑成一个社会主义、共产主义的巨像。虽然这个巨像还正在雕刻的过程中，还不是一个完美无缺的艺术品，但它的生动而光明的全貌已经显示在人民的面前了。只有那些惯于以爬石像的蚂蚁的感觉和观点对我们的社会生活妄下断语、乱发议论的人，才会硬说这是一块拙劣的石头，那么，就让他们成为比蚂蚁更加渺小的可怜虫吧！
