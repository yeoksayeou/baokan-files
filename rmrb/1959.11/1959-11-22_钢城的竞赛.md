    Competition in the Steel City
    By Our Correspondent Wei Lingbing
    This year, Romania plans to increase the production of its steel industry by 23% compared to 1958. Among them, steel production will increase by 38%, which means that the total steel production this year will reach 1.3 million tons.

        The Steel Giant Gets a Big Response
    This grand plan greatly inspired the production enthusiasm of metallurgical workers. The workers of the largest steel factory in the country—the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine—are not only determined to complete this year's production plan, but also guarantee to produce more than 40,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of iron, 30,000 tons of metallurgical coke, and 6,000 tons of steel products above the plan. At the same time, they used this guarantee as a condition for competition and challenged the metallurgical workers of the Resita United Factory in January this year.
    The workers of the Resita United Factory, which ranks second in the metallurgical sector, were unwilling to be outdone. Their response was to produce 30,000 tons of steel, 5,000 tons of iron, 5,000 tons of metallurgical coke, and 6,000 tons of steel products above the plan. The metallurgical workers of other factories across the country naturally did not want to stand idly by and also put forward overproduction guarantees and actively responded to the challenge. As a result, the upsurge of competition on the steel front, like the molten iron and steel in blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces, is boiling over. Hunedoara and Resita, these two famous steel cities, have always been the center of this competition.
    The Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine and the Resita United Factory produce most or all of the country's steel, pig iron, steel products, and metallurgical coke. Therefore, their competition is not just a question of who wins or loses; more importantly, it plays a decisive role in completing and overfulfilling this year's national steel production plan.
    The employees of these two factories believe that this competition is the most important event in their factories. After the start of the competition, the two factories exchanged competition information every other day and announced it to all employees. A huge wooden sign was hung in front of the Resita United Factory, with the words "Provide more steel, iron and steel products to the motherland, and always remember the competition with the metallurgical workers of Hunedoara!" written in eye-catching large characters. The competition conditions proposed by the two factories and the achievements made in the most recent day are listed in detail below. Workers always look at this big wooden sign when they enter and leave the factory. When they see that their factory is ahead, they work harder, and when they see that their factory is behind, they strive to catch up.

      The Upsurge of Competition Rises Higher and Higher
    A massive production competition movement then spread within the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine and the Resita United Factory. The workers of each workshop, each steelmaking furnace, ironmaking furnace, and each production team have all set their own overproduction targets and launched competitions with each other.
    The Party organizations, administrations, trade unions, and youth organizations of these two factories have done a lot of publicity and organizational work in guiding the vigorous development of the competition movement. Therefore, the workers' enthusiasm for production is getting higher and higher. They know that overfulfilling production tasks means accelerating the pace of socialist construction.
    In these two factories, the production competition movement quickly achieved remarkable results. The steelmaking workers of the Resita United Factory overfulfilled their production tasks by 39.5% in the first quarter. At present, the utilization coefficient of the open hearth furnace in this factory has approximately doubled compared to last year. In the No. 4 open hearth furnace, the production team led by Mocia Vasile, who was born as a peasant, created a record of smelting a furnace of steel in five hours, while it used to take eight or nine hours to smelt a furnace of steel. The utilization coefficients of open hearth furnaces, blast furnaces, and coke ovens in the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine have all exceeded the original plan.
    In the competition, the workers of the two factories gave full play to their initiative and creativity, put forward many rationalization proposals, reduced product costs, and saved a lot of wealth for the country. For example, the workers in the steelmaking workshop of the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine created a new method of complete deoxidation and direct injection of molten steel into ingot molds, which can save more than 4.4 million lei (Romanian currency) every year. In order to encourage workers to make rationalization proposals, this factory designated November as "Innovation Proposal Month."
    1959 is coming to an end. The competition between these two factories has also entered the most intense stage. Like athletes participating in a race, the workers of the two factories want to use all their strength to strive for the final victory when they are about to reach the finish line. In the Resita United Factory, the blast furnace workshop is in the lead and has completed the overproduction guarantee set at the beginning of the year on October 29. Although the open hearth furnace workshop is still far from completing the overproduction plan set at the beginning of the year due to the abnormal production of the newly put into production furnace, they have taken measures such as increasing auxiliary equipment and are doing everything possible to realize their guarantee.
    The blast furnace workshop and rolling mill workshop of the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine have also realized the overproduction guarantee set at the beginning of the year ahead of schedule. The steelmaking workers have already produced 38,000 tons of steel above the plan, and they can also realize the overproduction guarantee set at the beginning of the year by the end of the year.

    Help Each Other and Move Forward Together
    The workers of the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine and the Resita United Factory, on the one hand, are engaged in a production competition that does not give way to each other, and on the other hand, they are giving play to the spirit of socialist mutual assistance in the competition. They have sent representatives to each other several times to observe production and exchange experiences. At the beginning of the year, the blast furnace workshop of the Resita United Factory decided to produce 5,000 tons of pig iron above the plan for the whole year. However, the production performance at the beginning was not as good as the Hunedoara blast furnace. At this time, some workers expressed doubts about whether they could realize their guarantee this year. In addition to strengthening political and ideological work for the workers, the leaders of the factory and workshop also sent several workers to the Hunedoara blast furnace workshop to learn from experience. The Hunedoara blast furnace workers provided them with selfless help. After these workers returned to the factory, they promoted the learned experience in the workshop. Therefore, the production situation quickly improved, and by October 29, more than 10,000 tons of pig iron had been produced above the plan.
    In these two factories, mutual support between production teams is even more frequent. For example, in the second steelmaking workshop of the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine, the Oerelt Paul production team and the Mayer Augustine production team are examples of competition and cooperation. When this production team is busy with charging, repairing furnaces, or tapping steel, the workers of the other production team often take the initiative to help with tools in hand. Therefore, the achievements of these two production teams are better. There are even more examples of advanced workers helping technically backward workers in a production team. (Attached picture)

    钢城的竞赛
    本报记者　魏凌冰
    今年，罗马尼亚计划使钢铁工业的生产比1958年增长23％。其中，钢的生产增长38％，也就是使今年钢的总产量达到一百三十万吨。
        钢铁巨人一呼百应
    这个宏伟的计划大大鼓舞了冶金工人的生产热情。全国最大的钢铁工厂——洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业的工人们，不但决心完成今年的生产计划，而且保证超计划生产四万多吨钢、两万吨铁、三万吨冶金焦和六千吨钢材。同时，他们把这个保证作为竞赛条件，在今年1月间向累希擦联合工厂的冶金工人挑战。
    在冶金部门中名列第二的累希擦联合工厂的工人不甘示弱，他们的回答是超计划生产三万吨钢、五千吨铁、五千吨冶金焦、六千吨钢材。全国其他工厂的冶金工人自然不愿袖手旁观，也纷纷提出超产保证，积极应战。于是，钢铁战线上的竞赛热潮就像高炉和平炉中的铁水和钢水一样沸腾起来了。洪尼多阿拉和累希擦这两个著名的钢铁城市一直是这场竞赛的中心。
    洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业和累希擦联合工厂生产着全国绝大部分或全部的钢、生铁、钢材和冶金焦。因此，他们的竞赛并不只是谁胜谁负的问题；更重要的是它对完成和超额完成今年的全国钢铁生产计划起着决定性作用。
    这两个工厂的职工都认为，这场竞赛是他们工厂中的最重要事件。竞赛开始后，两个工厂每隔一天就交换一次竞赛情况，并且向全体职工公布。在累希擦联合工厂的门前挂着一个巨大的木牌，上面用醒目的大字写着：“向祖国提供更多的钢、铁和钢材，要随时记着同洪尼多阿拉冶金工人的竞赛！”下面分别详列着两厂提出的竞赛条件和最近一天取得的成绩。工人们在出入工厂时总要看一看这个大木牌。当他们看到自己的工厂走在前面时就干劲更大，当他们看到自己的工厂落后时就发奋追赶。
      竞赛热潮节节高涨
    排山倒海的生产竞赛运动紧接着在洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业和累希擦联合工厂内部铺开。各车间、各炼钢炉、炼铁炉和各个生产队的工人们都订出了本单位的超计划生产指标，相互展开竞赛。
    这两个工厂的党组织和行政、工会和青年组织在引导竞赛运动蓬勃发展方面做了许多宣传和组织工作。因此，工人的生产积极性越来越高。他们知道，超计划完成生产任务就意味着加速社会主义建设的步伐。
    在这两个工厂中，生产竞赛运动很快取得了显著成绩。累希擦联合工厂的炼钢工人在第一季度超计划39.5％完成了生产任务。目前这个工厂的平炉利用系数比去年大约增加了一倍。在四号平炉上，农民出身的摩恰·瓦西列所领导的生产队创造了五小时炼一炉钢的纪录，而以前炼一炉钢却需要八、九小时。洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业的平炉、高炉和炼焦炉的利用系数都超过了原计划。
    在竞赛中，两个工厂的工人发挥了主动性和创造性，提出了许多合理化建议，降低了产品成本，为国家节约了大量财富。例如洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业炼钢车间的工人，创造了完全脱氧和把钢水直接注入铸锭模的新方法，每年就可以节约四百四十多万列伊（罗币）。为了鼓励工人们提合理化建议，这个工厂把11月份定为“革新建议月”。
    1959年快要过完了。这两个工厂的竞赛也进入了最紧张的阶段。两厂的工人们就像参加赛跑的运动员一样，在快要到达终点时，都想使出全部气力争取最后胜利。在累希擦联合工厂中，高炉车间名列前茅，已在10月29日完成了年初的超产保证。平炉车间虽然由于新投入生产的炉生产不正常，距离完成年初订的超产计划还较远，但是他们已经采取了增加辅助设备等措施，千方百计争取实现自己的保证。
    洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业的高炉车间和轧钢车间也已提前实现了年初的超产保证。炼钢工人已经超计划生产了三万八千吨钢，到年底也可以实现年初订的超产保证。
    互相帮助共同前进
    洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业和累希擦联合工厂的工人们，一方面进行互不相让的生产竞赛，一方面又在竞赛中发挥社会主义互助精神。他们曾经数次相互派代表观摩生产，交流经验。年初，累希擦联合工厂的高炉车间决定全年超计划生产五千吨生铁。但是，一开头生产成绩就不如洪尼多阿拉的高炉好。这时，有些工人就对今年能否实现自己的保证表示怀疑。工厂和车间的领导除去对工人加强政治思想工作外，又派了几名工人到洪尼多阿拉的高炉车间去学习经验。洪尼多阿拉的高炉工人对他们进行了无私的帮助。这几名工人回厂后就在车间中推广学来的经验。因此，生产情况很快就好转了，至10月29日已经超计划生产了一万多吨生铁。
    在这两个工厂里，各生产队之间相互支援更是经常的事。例如在洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业的第二炼钢车间，奥列尔特·保尔生产队和马耶尔·奥古斯丁生产队就是既竞赛又合作的榜样。在这个生产队忙于上料、修炉或出钢的时候，另一生产队的工人常常手执工具主动来帮忙。因此，这两个生产队的成绩都是较好的。在一个生产队中先进工作者帮助技术落后的工人的例子就更多了。（附图片）
