(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: World public opinion continues to strongly condemn the Sananikone group's conspiracy to illegally try Lao Patriotic Front leader Souphanouvong and others in order to further expand the civil war in Laos.

Sun Duc Thang, recipient of the Lenin International Prize "For Strengthening Peace Among Nations," member of the World Peace Council, and Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, told the "Pravda" correspondent in Hanoi that the illegal arrest and impending trial of true patriots and staunch peace fighters not only brutally violated the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements but also violated the principles of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Sun Duc Thang said that in order to safeguard peace and uphold justice, peace-loving people of all countries must resolutely demand an end to interference in Laos' internal affairs, insist on the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and immediately release Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

Nguyen Xuan Thuy, Vice-Chairman and Secretary-General of the Vietnam Committee to Defend World Peace, member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, and Vice-Chairman of the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, sent telegrams on November 2nd to the World Peace Council and the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, respectively, stating that the government of Phoui Sananikone has arrested and imprisoned Prince Souphanouvong and seven other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front for more than three months, and now prepares to "try" them. This is a violation of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. The people of Laos and the people of many countries in Asia, Africa, and the world are demanding the restoration of their freedom.

In his telegram, Nguyen Xuan Thuy hoped that the World Peace Council and the Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee would express their attitude towards the illegal actions of the Sananikone government.

The Indonesian Peace Committee issued a statement on November 2nd, calling on the Indonesian government and people to lodge the most serious protest with the Lao government against the illegal trial of Souphanouvong and other Lao patriots.

The statement said that the Lao government's conspiracy to try and kill Lao patriots is being carried out under the instructions of the heads of the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). The statement pointed out that the Lao government's tyrannical actions constitute a direct attack on the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements and a brutal violation of democratic and freedom rights.

The statement pointed out that the charges against Souphanouvong and other Lao patriots were fabricated by the Lao government.

The Indonesian "People's Daily" published a commentary on November 2nd, stating that the persecution of members of the former Lao combat troops and the "trial" of Souphanouvong and other Lao patriots are aimed at paving the way for the United States to completely control Laos.

The Central Council of Bulgarian Trade Unions sent a telegram to the United Nations and the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, Phoui Sananikone, condemning the Lao government's illegal arrest and trial of Prince Souphanouvong and seven other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, and resolutely demanding the immediate release of these defenders of Lao national independence and peace.

The Supreme Council of the British Peace Committee held a meeting in London at the end of October. The meeting passed a resolution expressing regret over the current detention and impending trial of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front by the Lao authorities.

The resolution pointed out that this disregard for the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements will inevitably endanger peace in Southeast Asia and world peace.

Mrs. Blume, member of the Presidium of the World Peace Council, made a speech before leaving Vietnam, calling on peace-loving people all over the world to do everything possible to save Prince Souphanouvong.

She said that Prince Souphanouvong is a friend of peace and the savior of the Lao nation.

Mrs. Blume left Hanoi by plane on October 31 after ending her visit to Vietnam. During her visit to Vietnam, she had inspected the Vietnam-Laos border.

In her speech, Mrs. Blume asked: "What crime are Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front accused of? Is it because they respected the Vientiane Agreements?" She said that the United Nations "Investigative Subcommittee" has failed, and people cannot find any Vietnamese heads to present to the masters of the Lao authorities.

In the name of a peace fighter, Mrs. Blume appealed to those with patriotic hearts among the Lao judges, those who are clean and not bought by dollars in the Lao government, and the kind, brave, and optimistic Lao people. She said that defending Prince Souphanouvong "is the first step on the road to peace where the United States can no longer make trouble."

    立即释放苏发努冯！
    世界公众舆论继续发出正义呼吁
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：世界公众舆论继续强烈谴责萨纳尼空集团准备非法审讯老挝爱国战线党领导人苏发努冯等人以进一步扩大老挝内战的阴谋。
    “加强国际和平”列宁国际奖金获得者、世界和平理事会理事、越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团主席孙德胜对“真理报”驻河内记者说，对真正的爱国者和坚强的和平战士的非法逮捕和行将进行的审判，不仅粗暴地破坏了日内瓦协议和万象协议，而且违反了联合国的原则和人权宣言。
    孙德胜说，为了维护和平和伸张正义，爱好和平的各国人民必须坚决要求停止干涉老挝内政，坚持严格执行日内瓦协议和万象协议，立即释放苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党的其他领导人。
    越南保卫世界和平委员会副主席兼秘书长、世界和平理事会常务委员会委员、越南亚非人民团结委员会副主席阮春水2日分别打电报给世界和平理事会和亚非人民团结委员会书记处说，培·萨纳尼空政府把苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他七位领导人逮捕和监禁已经三个多月了，现在又准备“审判”他们。这是违反日内瓦协议和万象协议的行为。老挝人民、亚非和世界许多国家的人民都要求恢复他们的自由。
    阮春水在电报中希望世界和平理事会和亚非人民团结委员会对萨纳尼空政府的非法行为表示它们的态度。
    印度尼西亚和平委员会2日发表声明，呼吁印度尼西亚政府和人民向老挝政府提出最严重的抗议，反对非法审判苏发努冯和老挝其他爱国人士。
    声明说，老挝政府审判和杀害老挝爱国者的阴谋是在侵略性的东南亚条约军事集团的头子指示下进行的。声明指出，老挝政府这种横暴的行动构成对日内瓦协议和万象协议的直接进攻，粗暴地侵犯了民主和自由权利。
    声明指出，控告苏发努冯和老挝其他爱国人士的罪名是老挝政府捏造的。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”2日发表评论说，迫害前寮国战斗部队的成员和“审判”苏发努冯等老挝爱国人士，目的在于为美国完全控制老挝铺平道路。
    保加利亚工会中央理事会打电报给联合国和老挝王国首相萨纳尼空，谴责老挝政府非法逮捕和审讯苏发努冯亲王及老挝爱国战线党的其他七位领导人，坚决要求立即释放这些老挝民族独立及和平的捍卫者。
    英国和平委员会最高委员会10月底在伦敦举行会议，会议通过一项决议，对目前老挝当局监禁和即将审判苏发努冯亲王和其他老挝爱国战线党领袖一事，表示遗憾。
    决议指出，这种不顾日内瓦协议和万象协议的行为必将危及东南亚和平和世界和平。
    世界和平理事会主席团委员布伦姆夫人在离开越南之前发表谈话，呼吁全世界爱好和平的人士，尽一切力量拯救苏发努冯亲王。
    她说，苏发努冯亲王是和平的朋友和老挝民族的救星。
    布伦姆夫人结束了在越南的访问后在10月31日乘飞机离开了河内。在越南访问期间，她曾经到越南—老挝边境视察。
    布伦姆夫人在谈话中责问：“以什么罪名控告苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人呢？是不是因为他们尊重万象协议呢？”她说，联合国的“调查小组委员会”已经失败了，人们找不到任何越南人的脑袋来献给老挝当局的主子。
    布伦姆夫人以和平战士的名义向老挝审判官中具有爱国心的人和老挝政府中廉洁的不受美元收买的人以及善良的、勇敢的、乐观的老挝人民发出呼吁。她说，保卫苏发努冯亲王“是走向美国再也不能捣乱的和平道路上的第一步”。
