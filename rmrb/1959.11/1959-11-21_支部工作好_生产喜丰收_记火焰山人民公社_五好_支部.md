    Good Branch Work Leads to a Bumper Harvest
    -- On the "Five-Good" Branch of the Flame Mountain People's Commune

    The Party branch of the First Production Team of the Second Management District of the Flame Mountain People's Commune in Turpan County, Xinjiang, has been rated as a "Five-Good" branch because of its excellent ideological work, with Party members actively playing a role in various tasks, motivating the masses, and promoting production development.

    Due to the outstanding work of the Party branch, the commune members are highly motivated and the production has been bountiful. The average yield of ginned cotton per mu can reach 165 jin, an increase of about 30% compared to last year. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Wu Chunzhan, Ai Haiti photographed) (with pictures)
    The Party branch often uses rest time for political education. The picture shows the branch secretary reading the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to the commune members.
    In order to help backward production groups catch up with advanced units, the cadres of the Party branch go deep into the groups to help solve problems. This is the branch secretary Aibibula talking about production with the group leader Tuerdehan (left) when helping the first group of the first team.
    The first production team has a bumper harvest of cotton. The average yield per mu reaches 165 jin of ginned cotton, an increase of more than 40 jin compared to last year.
    The branch is very concerned about the lives of the commune members, and the nurseries and canteens are run very well. This is the Party branch member Nur (left) listening to the nursery staff Hairiqihan reporting on the situation of the nursery.
    The Party branch often pays attention to solving problems in production. This is the branch holding a meeting in the cotton field to discuss the later management of the cotton field.
