Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: Premier Zhou Enlai hosted a banquet this evening to entertain Ahmed Balafrej, former Prime Minister of Morocco, and Ahmed Reraqui, former Director of the Prime Minister's Office, who are currently visiting China.

    Premier Zhou Enlai first delivered a speech welcoming the Moroccan guests who had traveled from afar and celebrating Morocco's National Day. He said: "Mr. Balafrej and Mr. Reraqui have traveled thousands of miles from Morocco to visit our country, and we extend a warm welcome to them. Mr. Balafrej is not unfamiliar to us. He is a famous figure in Morocco who opposes imperialism and strives for national independence. We clearly remember his efforts to promote friendship between China and Morocco. It was during his tenure as Prime Minister of Morocco that China and Morocco established formal diplomatic relations. We are very honored to have the opportunity to receive such a distinguished guest."

    Premier Zhou said: "China and Morocco established contact in the very distant past. This connection was undermined by the aggression and rule of imperialism against our two countries. However, the people of our two countries have always cared for and sympathized with each other in the common struggle against imperialism and for national independence. Therefore, after our two countries achieved independence one after another, we quickly established diplomatic relations and developed our ancient friendship on a new basis. We firmly believe that in order to safeguard our respective national independence, build our own countries, and safeguard world peace, there is a broad prospect for the development of friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries."

    Premier Zhou concluded: "Tomorrow is the National Day of our friendly country, the Kingdom of Morocco. Let us raise our glasses to the prosperity of the Kingdom of Morocco and the happiness of the Moroccan people, to the friendship between the people of China and Morocco, to the health of Mr. Balafrej and Mr. Reraqui who accompanied him, to the health of His Excellency Abdallah Ibrahim, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Morocco, and to the health of His Majesty King Mohammed V of Morocco! Cheers!"

    Mr. Balafrej then delivered a speech at the banquet. In his speech, he thanked Premier Zhou for his compliments in his speech and thanked Premier Zhou for holding a grand banquet this evening to celebrate Morocco's National Day.

    He said: "During my very interesting visit to your great country, I saw the enthusiasm and confidence of the Chinese people in construction, which gave me great encouragement. After returning to my country, I will continue to work hard to fight for the freedom of my people."

    Mr. Balafrej said: "The Chinese people are advancing along the road of prosperity and strength that has already been opened up, and their spirit and courage cannot be stopped by any enemy." He also said that Premier Zhou was correct in saying that the friendly relations between China and Morocco had once been severed by imperialism. He expressed his hope that the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries could be further strengthened in the future.

    Mr. Balafrej concluded by warmly congratulating the Chinese people on their prosperity and strength, and congratulating the Chinese people on the great victories they have achieved in their revolutionary struggles and construction endeavors.

    Attending the banquet tonight were Liao Chengzhi, Bao Erhan, Zhang Xiruo, Zhang Hanfu, Xu Bing, Lei Renmin, Da Pongsheng, Hu Yuzhi, Ding Xilin, Yang Jingren, Wang Kunlun, Mei Gongbin, and Qiao Guanhua, leaders of relevant departments and people's organizations.

    周总理设宴欢迎摩洛哥客人
    并且祝贺摩洛哥王国国庆
    新华社17日讯　周恩来总理今天晚间举行宴会，招待正在我国访问的摩洛哥前首相艾哈迈德·贝拉弗里杰和前首相办公室主任艾哈迈德·拉哈基。
    周恩来总理首先致词欢迎不远千里而来的摩洛哥客人，并且庆祝摩洛哥国庆。他说：贝拉弗里杰先生和拉哈基先生不远千里从摩洛哥来到我国访问，我们向他们表示热烈的欢迎。贝拉弗里杰先生对于我们来说，是并不陌生的。他是摩洛哥的一位反对帝国主义和争取民族独立的著名人物。我们清楚地记得他对于促进中国和摩洛哥的友好所作的努力，正是在他担任摩洛哥首相的期间，中国和摩洛哥建立了正式的外交关系。我们能够有机会接待这样一位尊贵的客人，感到十分荣幸。
    周总理说：中国和摩洛哥在很遥远的过去就建立了联系。这种联系，由于帝国主义对我们两国的侵略和统治，曾经遭到破坏。但是，我们两国人民在反对帝国主义、争取民族独立的共同斗争中，却始终互相关怀、互相同情。因此，我们两国在先后取得独立以后，很快地就建立了外交关系，并且在新的基础上发展古老的友谊。我们深信，为了维护各自的民族独立、建设我们自己的国家和保障世界的和平，我们两国之间的友好合作关系有着广阔的发展前途。
    周总理最后说：明天是我们的友邦摩洛哥王国的国庆，让我们举杯，为摩洛哥王国的富强和摩洛哥人民的幸福，为中国和摩洛哥两国人民之间的友谊，为贝拉弗里杰先生和随他同来的拉哈基先生的健康，为摩洛哥王国首相阿卜杜拉·易卜拉欣阁下的健康，为摩洛哥国王穆罕默德五世陛下的健康，干杯！
    贝拉弗里杰先生接着在宴会上致词。他在致词中感谢周总理在宴会上的讲话中对他的称赞，并且感谢周总理在今晚举行的盛大宴会上庆祝摩洛哥国庆。
    他说：我在你们伟大国家进行的很有兴趣的访问中，看到了中国人民进行建设的热情和信心，这给了我很大的鼓励。回国以后，我要继续为争取本国人民的自由而努力。
    贝拉弗里杰先生说：中国人民正沿着已经开辟的繁荣富强的道路前进，他们的精神和勇敢，是任何敌人也阻挡不了的。他还说，刚才周总理讲到中摩两国的友好关系曾经一度被帝国主义所割断，这是很正确的。他表示希望两国的友好合作关系今后能够进一步加强。
    贝拉弗里杰先生最后热烈祝贺中国人民繁荣富强，祝贺中国人民在革命斗争和建设事业中取得的伟大胜利。
    出席今晚宴会作陪的，有各有关部门和人民团体的负责人廖承志，包尔汉，张奚若，章汉夫，徐冰，雷任民，达浦生，胡愈之，丁西林，杨静仁，王昆仑，梅龚彬，乔冠华等。
