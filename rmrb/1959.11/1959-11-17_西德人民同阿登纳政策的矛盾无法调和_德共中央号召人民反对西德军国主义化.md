    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th: "Neues Deutschland" published on the 8th the draft resolution submitted by the Central Committee of the German Communist Party for discussion at the party congress: "The situation in the Federal Republic and the struggle for peace and democracy."
    The draft states that West Germany has now become a foreign missile base and has begun to produce its own missiles. Atomic weapon depots and strategic weapons are increasing in West Germany. The military budget for atomic armament has exceeded more than half of the entire national budget, which is a dangerous situation for the future of West Germany. The struggle against conscription by residents born in 1922 reflects the West German people's desire for peace.
    The draft states that the current task is to prevent West Germany from becoming the source of a third world war and an atomic war. The historical responsibility of the German Communist Party is to work with workers, social democrats, trade unionists, and all peace-loving people in urban and rural areas to change West Germany's policies, thereby bringing a peaceful and democratic future to all residents of West Germany.
    The draft then puts forward the German Communist Party's nine-point specific action program. The program advocates: 1. Calling on all West German residents to exercise their democratic rights on the issues of immediately stopping atomic armament, abolishing conscription, establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones, achieving universal and complete disarmament worldwide, and establishing an all-German committee on an equal basis to draft a peace treaty with Germany and prepare for reunification;
    2. According to the constitution, stop any militarist and chauvinist propaganda, and dissolve militarist and fascist organizations;
    3. To give the Federal Parliament genuine democratic rights;
    4. Restore the legal status of the German Communist Party, release political prisoners, and stop the trials of peace and democracy fighters;
    5. Limit the power of monopoly capital and abolish laws that favor monopoly capital;
    6. Implement a national agricultural policy and strive for West German agriculture to no longer be subjected to the profits of the North Atlantic Group, the Common Market, and domestic and foreign monopolists;
    7. Protect the middle class, craftsmen, and small and medium-sized enterprises from the oppression of monopoly capital;
    8. Strive for the complete equal rights of women and young people in all economic, national, and social life;
    9. Protect and develop the national cultural heritage, strive for progressive and democratic content, and ensure the development of peace and humanitarianism in all cultural fields.
    The draft analyzes the social forces for realizing these programs. The draft points out that this primarily relies on the working class and its unity. The draft calls for establishing understanding between the German Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party.
    The draft points out that the contradictions between the interests of the West German people and Adenauer's policies are currently insurmountable; a small group of monopolists and militarists disregard the wishes of the people, but the victory of the working class and peace-loving people will surely come, and militarism and imperialism will no longer have a future. The draft expresses confidence in the power of the people and their desire for a peaceful future.

    西德人民同阿登纳政策的矛盾无法调和
    德共中央号召人民反对西德军国主义化
    新华社柏林电　“新德意志报”8日发表了德国共产党中央委员会提交党代表会议讨论的决议草案：“联邦共和国的形势和为和平与民主而斗争”。
    草案指出，目前西德已经成为外国导弹基地，并开始自己生产导弹，原子武器仓库和战略武器在西德日益增加，为进行原子武装的军备预算已超过国家全部预算的一半以上，这些情况对西德的前途是一种危险。1922年出生的居民反对应征的斗争反映了西德人民渴望和平的愿望。
    草案指出，目前的任务是阻止西德成为第三次世界大战和原子战争的策源地。德国共产党的历史责任是同工人、社会民主党人、工会工作者以及城乡一切爱好和平的人民一起，使西德的政策转变，从而给西德全体居民带来和平、民主的前途。
    草案接着提出德国共产党的九点具体行动纲领，纲领主张，一、号召全体西德居民，要他们在立即停止原子武装、取消征兵、建立无原子武器区、在全世界实现普遍和全面裁军、在平等基础上建立全德委员会起草对德和约和准备统一等这些问题上，行使自己的民主权利；
    二、根据宪法停止任何军国主义和沙文主义的宣传，解散军国主义和法西斯主义团体；
    三、使联邦议会具有真正的民主权利；
    四、恢复德国共产党的合法地位，释放政治犯，停止对和平民主战士的审讯；
    五、限制垄断资本的势力，取消有利于垄断资本的法律；
    六、实现民族的农业政策，争取西德农业不再屈从于北大西洋集团、共同市场以及本国和外国垄断资本家的利润；
    七、保护中产阶层、手工业者和中小企业免受垄断资本的压迫；
    八、争取妇女和青年在全部经济、国家和社会生活中的完全平等权利；
    九、保护和发展民族文化遗产、争取进步和民主的内容，并保障和平和人道主义在所有文化领域中的发展。
    草案分析了实现这些纲领的社会力量，草案指出，这首先依靠工人阶级和它的团结统一。草案要求建立德国共产党和社会民主党的谅解。
    草案指出，目前西德人民的利益和阿登纳政策间的矛盾是无法克服的；一小撮垄断资本家和军国主义者毫不顾及人民的愿望，而工人阶级和爱好和平的人们的胜利必将到来，军国主义和帝国主义不再会有前途。草案表示相信人民的力量和他们对争取和平前途的愿望。
