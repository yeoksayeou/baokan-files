Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 26th: A joint statement by the party and government delegations of Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic was released here today. The joint statement welcomes the Soviet Union's proposal for comprehensive and complete disarmament and pledges that both countries will do their utmost to strive for its realization.

This joint statement was issued following recent talks between the two countries' party and government delegations in the German Democratic Republic. The joint statement emphasizes that the Czechoslovak party and government delegation visited the German Democratic Republic at a time when international tensions were easing, which should be attributed to the unremitting efforts of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. The statement said that, in this regard, the struggle of Asian and African countries for the complete elimination of colonial rule is also of great significance.

The two party and government delegations believe that a summit meeting should be convened as soon as possible. At the same time, both sides believe that negotiations on the conclusion of a German peace treaty and the normalization of the situation in West Berlin are in the interest of all European countries and should therefore be realized without delay. The Czechoslovak government expresses its willingness to conclude a peace treaty with either of the two German states, or with whichever German state is willing to conclude a treaty, while fully supporting the recent proposal of the German Democratic Republic for talks between the two German states.

The joint statement points out that the ruling circles in West Germany are trying every means to exacerbate international tensions and accelerate the nuclear armament of the West German army. The statement emphasizes that it would be in line with the hopes of the people of all countries if the West German ruling circles finally drew conclusions from the current international balance of power and embarked on the path of seeking understanding and peaceful cooperation.

The joint statement said that during the talks, the two party and government delegations exchanged experiences in the work of the two parties and in socialist construction. Both sides expressed their determination to resolutely combat any manifestations of revisionism and opportunism in the future, while strengthening the militant unity between the two parties.

The joint statement emphasizes the great significance of international cooperation and mutual assistance between socialist countries for rapid progress along the socialist road.

The joint statement said that during the talks, the two sides signed a trade and navigation agreement, and also signed an agreement on further developing economic, scientific, and technological cooperation between the two countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 25th: A mass rally was held in Berlin on the afternoon of the 25th to welcome the Czechoslovak party and government delegation headed by Novotny.

The rally was organized by the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) ,the Council Of Ministers Of the German Democtratic Republic, and the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany. Party and government leaders of the German Democratic Republic, thousands of representatives from all walks of life, and foreign diplomatic envoys attended the rally.

Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, spoke at the meeting, pointing out that the two party and government delegations of Czechoslovakia and Germany had reached complete agreement on all the issues discussed. The talks were held to safeguard the cause of peace and socialist construction. It will further strengthen cooperation between the two countries.

Ulbricht said that peace is indispensable for socialism. The struggle for peace is an indispensable element of socialist policy. He said that certain imperialist countries have always wanted to use military means to decide the issues between the two world systems. However, this policy is doomed to failure. Peaceful economic competition will show that the socialist system is better for the working people than the capitalist system.

Ulbricht spoke about the German question. He emphasized that the German question cannot be resolved as long as West Germany continues its arms race and atomic armament.

Novotny, the head of the Czechoslovak party and government delegation, said in his speech that the Czechoslovak party and government delegation's visit to the German Democratic Republic was a manifestation of the new type of relations between the two countries. Czechoslovakia and Germany belong to the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is a guarantee of the friendship between the two countries, and this friendship will continue to be strengthened on the road of proletarian internationalism.

    德捷两国党政代表团联合声明
    主张进行谈判缔结对德和约
    双方签订贸易与航运以及进一步发展经济合作两个协定
    新华社布拉格26日电　此间今天发表了捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国两国党政代表团的联合声明。联合声明表示欢迎苏联提出的全面和彻底裁军的建议，并且保证两国将竭尽全力为争取实现这一建议而奋斗。
    这项联合声明是两国党政代表团最近在德意志民主共和国会谈以后发表的。联合声明强调指出，捷克斯洛伐克党政代表团是在国际紧张局势缓和的时候访问德意志民主共和国的，而局势缓和应归功于苏联和其它社会主义国家坚持不渝的努力。声明说，在这方面，亚非国家为完全消除殖民主义统治而进行的斗争，也具有重要意义。
    两国党政代表团认为，最高级会议应尽早召开。双方同时认为，就缔结对德和约和使西柏林局势正常化进行谈判，对所有欧洲国家都是有利的，因此，应该毫不迟延地使之实现。捷克斯洛伐克政府表示愿意同两个德国或其中任一个愿意缔约的德国缔结和约，同时完全支持德意志民主共和国最近提出的关于两个德国之间进行会谈的建议。
    联合声明指出，西德统治集团正在想尽办法加剧国际紧张局势，加速西德军队的核武装。声明强调指出：如果西德统治集团最终从目前的国际力量对比中得出结论，而走上谋求谅解和和平合作的道路，那将是符合各国人民的希望的。
    联合声明说，两国党政代表团在会谈中曾经交流了两党的工作经验和社会主义建设经验。双方表示决心在今后对修正主义和机会主义的任何表现进行坚决的斗争，同时要加强两党之间的战斗团结。
    联合声明着重指出了社会主义国家之间的国际合作和互助，对于沿着社会主义道路高速度前进的重大意义。
    联合声明说，在会谈期间，双方签订了一项贸易与航运协定，还签订了关于进一步发展两国之间的经济、科学与技术合作的协定。
    据新华社柏林25日电　25日下午，在柏林举行了群众大会，欢迎以诺沃提尼为首的捷克斯洛伐克党政代表团。
    这次集会是由德国统一社会党中央委员会、德意志民主共和国部长会议和民主德国全国阵线全国委员会组织的。德意志民主共和国党政领导人和几千名各界代表以及各国外交使节出席了大会。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希在会上讲话，他指出，捷德两国党政代表团在讨论过的所有问题上都取得了完全一致的意见。双方所举行的会谈是为了保障和平事业和社会主义建设。它将进一步加强两国的合作。
    乌布利希说，对于社会主义来说，和平是不可缺少的。争取和平的斗争是社会主义政策的一个不可或缺的因素。他说，某些帝国主义国家一直想用军事手段来决定两个世界体系之间的问题。可是，这个政策是注定要失败的。和平经济竞赛将表明，对于劳动人民来说，社会主义制度比资本主义制度要好。
    乌布利希谈到了德国问题。他强调指出，只要西德继续进行军备竞赛和原子武装，德国问题就不可能得到解决。
    捷克斯洛伐克党政代表团团长诺沃提尼在讲话中说，捷克斯洛伐克党政代表团这次访问德意志民主共和国，是两国之间的新型关系的表现。捷德两国同属于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，这是两国友谊的保证，这种友谊将继续在无产阶级国际主义道路上加强。德意志民主共和国进行的斗争将得到捷克斯洛伐克的同情和全面支持。
    诺沃提尼最后谴责西德军国主义是紧张的制造者。
