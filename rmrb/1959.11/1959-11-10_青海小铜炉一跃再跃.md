    In a Place Where There Was Originally No Steel
    Qinghai Small Copper Furnaces Leap Again and Again
    The Qinghai Nonferrous Metals Company was established last year during the mass campaign to produce steel using indigenous methods.
    Since the beginning of this year, the company has deeply carried out the production increase and conservation movement centered on "high output, high quality, and low consumption," vigorously promoting technical revolution and technical innovation, constantly breaking through the technical barriers in mining and smelting, and setting off wave after wave of production upsurges. In the first quarter, the small earthen copper smelting furnaces built with stones had an average furnace life of only three days and nights, and a daily output of 1.8 tons of copper matte (a semi-finished product containing 30% to 50% copper); in the second quarter, after changing to a furnace type that was small at the top and large at the bottom, the furnace life increased to five days and nights, and the daily output of copper matte was 2.8 tons; in July, another major improvement was made to the furnace type, and local refractory bricks were used for the tuyeres. The highest daily output of each furnace reached 18 tons, and the furnace life increased to eight days and nights. The original manual blowing was gradually replaced by donkey boilers and electricity, and a reverberatory furnace was built, which, after testing, produced blister copper.
    This nonferrous metals company overfulfilled its annual plan three months ahead of schedule by the end of September.

    在原来没有钢铁的地方
    青海小铜炉一跃再跃
    青海有色金属公司是去年大办土法炼钢中创建起来的。
    今年以来，这个公司深入开展了以“高产、优质、低消耗”为中心的增产节约运动，大闹技术革命和技术革新，不断突破采矿和冶炼技术关，掀起了一浪高一浪的生产热潮。一季度用石块砌的小土法炼铜炉，平均炉龄只有三昼夜，日产冰铜（含铜30％到50％的半成品）一点八吨；二季度改为上小下大的炉型后，炉龄提高到五昼夜，日产冰铜二点八吨；7月份又对炉型进行了一次较大的改进，并用当地的耐火砖砌风口，每个炉子日产量最高达到十八吨，炉龄提高到八昼夜。原来的人力鼓风也逐步为锅驼机和电力所代替，并建成了反射炉一座，经过试验，炼出了粗铜。
    这个有色金属公司9月底就提前三个月超额完成了年度计划。
