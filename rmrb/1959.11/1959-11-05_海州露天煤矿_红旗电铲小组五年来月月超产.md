Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin Dispatch: The No. 99 Electric Shovel Team of the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine has consistently exceeded production quotas safely every month for five years, starting in November 1954. They have also broken the high-yield record for a single electric shovel in the open-pit mine multiple times. As a result, they have been named an advanced collective of Liaoning Province and the national coal mine six times.

The No. 99 Electric Shovel is an outstanding high-yield Red Flag Electric Shovel. Over the past five years, it has produced more than 5,490,000 tons/cubic meters of coal and overburden for the country. Its production capacity has also increased dramatically year by year. In 1957, it completed the annual task of 980,000 tons/cubic meters 30 days ahead of schedule. In 1958, it completed the task of 1,020,000 tons/cubic meters 45 days ahead of schedule. In the first nine months of this year, it has already completed a workload of 1,010,000 tons/cubic meters.

The No. 99 Electric Shovel is not only a high-yield banner but also a model of safe production. The team's workers work on cliffs more than ten meters high all year round, and it is easy to have accidents if they are not careful. In this case, they have not only eliminated personal and mechanical accidents of all sizes but have also created advanced experiences with the contracting system. The nine members of their team have specific divisions of labor to maintain one or two thousand large and small electrical components on the electric shovel, achieving on-the-spot inspection and maintenance during the current shift. Therefore, although the electric shovel works in smoky conditions, all parts and components remain clean.

They are all conscientious and diligent in their work and actively study. In the past few years, they have proposed more than a dozen major technological innovations in the mechanical field. Among them, the use of hardwood to enlarge the electric shovel drum alone has increased the production efficiency of the electric shovel by more than 14% and the utilization rate of the electric shovel wire rope by 200%, which can save the country 6 million yuan every year.

    海州露天煤矿  红旗电铲小组五年来月月超产
    据新华社阜新电　阜新海州露天矿九九号电铲小组五年如一日，从1954年11月以来，一直都是月月安全超额完成生产任务，并且多次突破了露天矿开矿以来的单位电铲高产纪录。因此，它六次被命名为辽宁省和全国煤矿的先进集体。
    九九号电铲是出色的高额丰产红旗电铲。五年来，它给国家生产了煤炭和剥离土石方五百四十九万多吨、立方米。它的生产能力也逐年猛烈提高，1957年提前三十天完成了全年九十八万吨、立方米的任务，1958年提前四十五天完成了一百零二万吨、立方米的任务；而在今年的头九个月内，就完成了一百零一万吨、立方米的工作量。
    九九号电铲不但是高额丰产旗帜，也是安全生产标兵。小组工人们成年累月地在十几米高的崖石上工作，稍不小心，就容易发生危险。在这种情况下，他们不但消灭了大小人身、机械事故，还创造了包机制先进经验。他们小组的九个人具体分工维护电铲上的一两千种大小电件，做到现班检查、现班维护。因此，电铲虽然在烟尘弥漫的条件下工作，各部件零件却始终保持干净。
    他们工作起来都兢兢业业，积极钻研，几年来，在机械方面提出十几项重大技术革新，其中用硬质木头加大电铲滚筒一项，就提高电铲生产效率14％以上，提高电铲钢丝绳使用率200％，每年能为国家节约六百万元。
