Technical Innovation Blossoms Everywhere, Big and Small
83% of Groups in the First Automobile Factory’s Engine Workshop are Making Innovations, and Every Machine is Being Improved

(Our dispatch from Changchun, November 23rd) The Engine Workshop of the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, after criticizing and overcoming the “valuing the big and neglecting the small” mentality of a few cadres who only focused on major technical innovations and neglected improving minor operations, has made the technical innovation movement in the entire workshop more widespread and in-depth. A situation has emerged where more than 83% of the groups are making innovations and every machine is being improved, greatly increasing production capacity. The production capacity of all 574 processes in the workshop has increased by 20% to more than 100%.

After seriously studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workshop's leading cadres realized that only by combining the increased production and economy movement with a widespread and in-depth mass technical innovation movement could significant results be achieved. However, a few cadres believed that the First Automobile Factory was a large-scale modern factory, only emphasizing "catching big fish" and neglecting the masses' small innovations. The workshop leaders organized the cadres to examine and criticize this harmful thinking of valuing the big and neglecting the small, and put forward the slogan of "Everyone has suggestions, every machine is improved" to all employees, so that the idea of ​​combining big and small, linking points and surfaces, and comprehensive blossoming took root among the workers. All the workshop’s employees, focusing on improving current production, overcoming weak links and major critical points, extensively and deeply carried out the technical innovation movement.

In the in-depth technical innovation movement, the entire workshop launched a "one-dragon" competition, organizing all the continuous operations of each process to achieve a full-line leap forward. This competition stimulated every link on the assembly line to carry out technical innovations. The valve cover group of the parts department used to be unable to reach the level of 250 vehicle sets per shift with its twelve machine tools. Now, thanks to the workers in the group using their brains and innovating in various aspects, some have accelerated the speed of tool changing and adjustment, and others have rationally used measuring tools to reduce auxiliary time. As a result, the entire group has basically achieved 250 vehicle sets per shift. The double-wheel grinder in the crankshaft department was originally the least efficient equipment in the department. After the workers modified the machine tool and rationally arranged the processing procedures, the production efficiency increased by 80%. In order to popularize the innovative creations in operating methods, the workshop also mobilized the masses to carry out a technical performance competition. After launching the technical performance competition, workers submitted 950 innovation proposals in just one month, and 407 processes achieved 250 vehicle sets per shift, and 227 processes achieved 200 vehicle sets per shift.

    技术革新大小并举全面开花
    第一汽车厂发动机车间83％的小组人人有创造台台有革新
    本报长春23日电　长春第一汽车制造厂发动机车间，批判和克服了少数干部只重视重大技术革新、忽视改进点滴操作的“重大轻小”思想，使全车间技术革新运动开展得更加广泛深入，出现了83％以上的小组人人有创造、台台有革新的局面，大大提高了生产能力。全车间有五百七十四个工序的生产能力，提高了20％到一倍以上。
    车间领导干部在认真学习了党的八届八中全会文件之后，认识到只有把增产节约运动同广泛深入开展群众性技术革新结合起来，才能使增产节约收到显著效果。但是，有少数干部认为第一汽车厂是个大型现代化工厂，只强调“钓大鱼”，忽视群众的点滴创造。车间领导人员组织干部们检查和批判了这种重大轻小的有害思想，向全体职工提出了“人人有建议，台台有革新”的口号，使大小并举、点面结合、遍地开花结果的思想在职工群众中生了根。全车间职工围绕提高当前生产、克服薄弱环节和重大关键，广泛深入地开展了技术革新运动。
    在深入开展技术革新运动中，全车间开展了“一条龙”竞赛，把连续作业的各道工序统统组织起来，实现全线跃进。这个竞赛激发了流水生产线上的各个环节大搞技术革新。零件工部瓦盖小组十二台机床以前达不到班产二百五十辆份的水平，现在由于小组工人个个开动脑筋，从各个方面进行革新，有的加快了换刀调整速度，有的合理使用量具，减少辅助时间，结果使全组基本上达到了班产二百五十辆份。曲轴工部的双轮磨床原是这个工部效率最低的设备，工人改装了机床，合理安排了加工工序之后，使生产效率提高了80％。为了普遍推广在操作方法上的革新创造，车间又发动群众开展了技术表演大竞赛。开展技术表演大竞赛以后，仅一个月，工人就提出了九百五十项革新建议，有四百零七个工序实现了班产二百五十辆份，二百二十七个工序实现了班产二百辆份。
