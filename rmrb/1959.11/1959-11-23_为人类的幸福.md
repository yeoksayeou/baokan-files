    For the Happiness of Mankind
    Beijing Planetarium　Jiang Haicheng
    Recently, I watched the Soviet science education film "The First Artificial Planet," and I was delighted to see the process of the Soviet Union's world-shaking scientific achievement. But what is even more exciting is that, at this time, the third cosmic rocket launched by the Soviet Union—the automatic interplanetary station—has successfully transmitted the basic information obtained in the first orbit to the ground, is further sorting out these valuable data, will publish detailed maps of the back of the moon, and is producing the first batch of lunar globes. At the same time, I saw the People's Daily published articles by Soviet Academy of Sciences Academician Sedov and President Nesmeyanov. As Sedov pointed out: each launch of a Soviet cosmic rocket is a new and major step in the development of space navigation, and they will all be recorded in history as the basic stages of studying outer space and preparing for interstellar transportation. As for mankind's desire to reach the moon and the nearest planets to Earth, Nesmeyanov tells us that, thanks to the great new scientific achievements of the Soviet Union, it is no longer a distant future, but a matter of this century. At the same time, he also tells us, "Soviet rockets are powerful tools for studying the universe and will never be used to do things that harm mankind. Socialist countries use the infinite possibilities of human wisdom only for peaceful purposes, for the benefit of all people."
    I think that his paragraph is the best explanation of why the world's first artificial Earth satellite was a Soviet satellite, the first artificial planet in the solar system was a Soviet planet, while the United States' experiments on cosmic rockets have repeatedly failed. Progressive humanity around the world is sharing the honor and happiness brought about by the great achievements of Soviet science. In order to safeguard the happiness and safety of mankind, our scientific workers are very supportive of Nesmeyanov's words: abandon armaments and war, peacefully use the greatest achievements of science and technology, and scientists from all countries actively cooperate in this noble humanitarian cause.

    为人类的幸福
    北京天文馆　姜海程
    最近看了苏联科学教育片“第一颗人造行星”，我欣喜的从那里看到了关于苏联震动世界的科学创举的经过。但更令人兴奋的是，在这个时候，苏联发射的第三个宇宙火箭——自动行星际站，已经成功地把第一圈运行中得到的基本情报传到了地面，正进一步整理这些可贵的资料，将发表月球背面详图，正在制作第一批月球仪，同时看到了人民日报发表了苏联科学院院士谢道夫和院长涅斯米扬诺夫发表文章的消息。正如谢道夫所指出的：苏联每一个宇宙火箭的发射都是发展宇宙航行方面的新的重大步骤，它们都将作为研究宇宙空间和准备星际交通的基本阶段载入史册。而人类到达月球和离地球最近的行星的企求，涅斯米扬诺夫告诉我们，由于苏联伟大的新的科学成就，已经不是遥远的未来，而是本世纪的事了。同时，他也告诉我们，“苏联火箭是研究宇宙的强大工具，决不会被用来作出危害人类的事。社会主义国家利用人类智慧的无限可能性只是为了和平的目的，造福全体人民。”
    我想，他这一段话，是为什么世界上第一颗人造地球卫星是苏联的卫星，太阳系第一颗人造行星是苏联的行星，而美国对宇宙火箭的试验累遭失败的最好说明。全世界进步人类在分享着苏联科学上的伟大成就带来的荣誉和幸福。为了维护人类的幸福和安全，我们科学工作者是非常拥护涅斯米扬诺夫的话：放弃军备和战争，和平利用科学技术的最伟大成就，各国科学家在这一崇高人道事业中，积极合作。
