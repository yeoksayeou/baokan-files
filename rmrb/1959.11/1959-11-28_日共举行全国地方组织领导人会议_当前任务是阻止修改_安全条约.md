    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 26th: According to today's "Akahata" report, the Japanese Communist Party held a meeting of chairpersons of the metropolitan, Hokkaido, prefectural, and county committees in Tokyo from October 28th to 30th.

      "Akahata" published the documents from this meeting today, including the summary of the report by Kenji Miyamoto, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, titled "Strive for the Advancement of the Struggle and Strengthen the Party," the report by Ichizo Suzuki, member of the Central Committee Secretariat, titled "Overview and Problems of the Struggle," the report by Harushige Matsushima, member of the Central Committee Secretariat, titled "On Strengthening the Party and Building the Party," as well as the meeting discussion and the summary of the meeting made by the Central Committee Secretariat.

    The summary pointed out that, generally speaking, the Japanese people's struggle to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the "Security Treaty" is further penetrating the broad masses and is developing daily. The Japanese Communist Party must strive to develop the struggles of all strata and aspects into unified actions and a united front centered on the struggle to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the "Security Treaty," which is the urgent task at present. In this common struggle, efforts must be made consistently to strive for the establishment of a national democratic united front.

    The summary pointed out that the current situation is very urgent. Trade unions must prepare to hold strikes to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the "Security Treaty." The Communist Party and democratic forces should actively and intensively carry out propaganda and organizational activities in all regions.

    The summary requested party members to take unified action with members of the Socialist Party and trade unions in all towns, villages, and workplaces, but at the same time, be vigilant and avoid falling into the errors of tailism and sectarianism by only focusing on cooperation.

    The summary emphasized that in the process of preventing the revision and striving for the abolition of the "Security Treaty," the Communist Party must emphasize advocating the overthrow of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, and repeatedly publicize the necessity of establishing a national democratic united front and the necessity of establishing a government based on this united front.

    The summary pointed out that the key to determining the trend of this struggle will be the struggle of all patriotic and democratic forces centered on the working class. Of course, the Communist Party should play an advanced and vanguard role in the struggle.

    The summary pointed out: Judging from the current situation of democratic forces in Japan, the Communist Party must strengthen solidarity with the Socialist Party and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and strive to strengthen and expand the struggle.
