Li Baichuan is a boar inseminator in the Haicang People's Commune in the suburbs of Xiamen. At the end of 1955, the agricultural department gave him a "Yorkshire" boar and asked him to be responsible for cultivating good breeds of pigs. But there were no "Yorkshire" sows, so what could he do? In the spring of the following year, he happened to find a farmer who had a "Yorkshire" sow piglet. However, the piglet's hind legs had been accidentally scalded and disabled, and it also suffered from swollen neck disease. Li Baichuan was overjoyed to see this pig. He paid for medicine and quickly cured the swollen neck disease. When he bought the pig back, it was skinny and weighed only forty-eight pounds. He carefully raised it, and after more than a month, the pig finally recovered its health. It started mating in August and gave birth to its first litter of nine piglets in December.

When this sow was giving birth to its second litter of piglets, it died of dystocia. Li Baichuan immediately dissected the dead pig and rescued five piglets that were still alive. From then on, he nurtured this group of little "Yorkshires" who had lost their mother like a loving mother. Through hard work, the piglets grew up and were all lively and strong.

In order to breed more and faster good breeds and let the "Yorkshire" descendants be all over the place, Li Baichuan also found a method of rapid reproduction. For example, ordinary sows can only give birth twice a year, and do not go into heat during the two-month lactation period after giving birth, so they cannot mate. Li Baichuan came up with the method of "transferring breeds for foster care," that is, when the "Yorkshire" sow gave birth to piglets, he would send the piglets to local sows for breastfeeding, so that the "Yorkshire" sow could mate one week after giving birth, thus achieving three litters a year.

For more than two years, in order to do a good job in breeding, he has carefully recorded and studied the mating and fertility periods of sows. When a sow is approaching its due date, he often goes to try to squeeze the sow's breasts. If he finds milk, it means that the sow will give birth within six hours. At this time, even on a cold night, he stays by the sow's side waiting for delivery. Under his careful care, no piglets have ever been crushed to death by the sow. From 1957 to the present, Li Baichuan has bred more than 160 "Yorkshire" pigs, which not only meets the local demand for good breed piglets, but also supports the surrounding counties.

Li Baichuan's success in breeding good breeds of pigs is inseparable from the scientific feeding methods he has established. The pigs he raises are all numbered and registered, and their date of birth, weight, mating period, and delivery period are carefully recorded. For piglets that have just been weaned, he mainly feeds refined feed, and appropriately mixes in bone meal and oyster shell powder to increase calcium and promote bone development. At the beginning, he feeds five meals a day, and only allows them to eat 80% full for each meal, so they have a strong appetite when he feeds them for the next meal. As they grow older, he gradually reduces the number of feedings. For large pigs, he mainly feeds coarse feed, with an appropriate mix of refined feed. In terms of solving the source of feed, in addition to using a small amount of refined feed, he mainly relies on green feed. The pigsty must be cleaned every day to keep it clean. Under his feeding management, no pigs have ever been sick in groups. The pigs he raises all weigh more than 500 catties, the piglets gain 378 catties in eight months, and the largest sow weighs 1,024 catties.

Li Baichuan actively breeds good breeds of pigs and has been praised by the Party and the government. Since 1956, he has been rewarded by the commune and county every year, and was named an advanced producer in socialist construction in Xiamen in 1958.

    培育种猪的标兵李百川
    李百川是厦门市郊海沧人民公社的种猪配种员。1955年底，农业部门交给他一头“约克夏”种公猪，要他负责培育良种猪。但是没有“约克夏”种母猪，怎么办呢？第二年春天，他偶然发现一家农民有一头“约克夏”种小母猪。可是这头小猪的后腿不慎被烫伤残废了，同时还患着肿脖病。李百川见到这头猪，如获至宝，他出钱买药，很快治好了肿脖病。把这头猪买回来时，瘦骨伶仃，只有四十八斤重。他精心饲养，经过一个多月的时间，这头猪终于恢复了健康。8月开始配种，12月生下了第一胎小猪九头。
    这头母猪生第二胎小猪的时候，就难产死了。李百川立即把死猪剖腹，抢救出还活着的五头小猪。从此，他就像慈母一样抚养着这群失去妈妈的小“约克夏”。经过辛勤照料，小猪娃长大了，个个活泼健壮。
    为了更多更快的繁殖良种，让“约克夏”的子孙满堂，李百川还找到了快速繁殖法。例如一般的母猪每年只能生育两次，在生育后两个月的哺乳期不发情，无法交配。李百川想出了“移种寄养”的办法，即当“约克夏”种母猪生下小猪后，就把猪娃寄给本地母猪哺乳，这样就使“约克夏”种母猪在产后一周就可交配，从而实现一年三胎。
    两年多来，为了搞好配种工作，他详细记载、研究母猪的配种期和生育期。母猪临近产期时，他经常去试挤母猪的乳房，如果发现乳汁，说明母猪在六小时内就要生育。这时，那怕是严寒的夜晚，他也守在母猪身旁等候分娩。在他精心照料下，从来没有一头猪娃被母猪压死过。从1957年到现在，经过李百川的手，繁殖了“约克夏”猪一百六十多头，不仅满足当地良种仔猪的需要，而且支援了附近各县。
    李百川繁殖良种猪获得成绩，和他建立了一套科学的饲养方法是分不开的。他所饲养的猪，每头都编号登记，仔细记载着出生年月、体重、配种期、分娩期等。对刚断奶的小猪，他以喂精饲料为主，并适当的掺以牛骨粉、蠔壳粉，增加钙质，促进骨胳的发育。开始时每天喂五餐，每餐只让它吃八分饱，下一餐喂的时候食欲就旺。随着年龄的增长，逐渐减少喂食的次数。对大猪，则以粗饲料为主，适当搭配精饲料。在解决饲料的来源方面，除用少量的精饲料外，主要依靠青饲料。猪舍每天都要打扫，经常保持清洁。在他的饲养管理下，没有发生过成群的猪生病。经他喂养的猪每头都在五百斤以上，小猪八个月长膘三百七十八斤，最大的一头母猪体重一千零二十四斤。
    李百川积极繁殖良种猪，受到党和政府的赞扬。1956年以来，每年都受到社、县的奖励，1958年评为厦门市社会主义建设先进生产者。
