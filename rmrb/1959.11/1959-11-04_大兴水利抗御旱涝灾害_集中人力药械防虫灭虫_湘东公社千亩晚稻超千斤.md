Vigorously Build Water Conservancy to Resist Drought and Flood Disasters; Concentrate Manpower and Machinery to Prevent and Eliminate Insects:
Xiangdong Commune Achieves Over 1,000 Jin Per Mu for Thousand Mu of Late Rice

(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 3rd dispatch) The Xiangdong People's Commune in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, following its great harvest of early rice this year, has joyfully begun harvesting its more than 26,000 mu of double-season late rice, reporting a general bumper harvest. According to the now harvested, threshed, dried, and cleaned and accepted 1,300 mu of late rice, the average yield per mu has reached 1,003 jin.

Of these harvested late rice fields, some are in the plains, some in the mountains, some are ridged fields, and some are paddy fields. Generally, yields have increased by 60% to 100% compared to last year. For example, the Jiantian Brigade, located in the plains, has seen most of its over 600 mu of harvested late rice fields yielding between 1,000 and 1,300 jin per mu. The Xincun Brigade even has 13 mu of continuous fields averaging 1,451 jin per mu. In the mountainous and hilly areas, the Dacheng and Jizhong Brigades, which originally had poor soil and the lowest yields, have also seen the late rice in their several dozen mu of cold paddy fields exceeding 800 jin per mu.

The average yield of late rice in Xiangdong Commune last year was 432 jin per mu, and the average yield of early rice this year was 648 jin per mu. Based on the current late rice harvest, cadres and commune members unanimously agree that the yield will not only greatly surpass last year's late rice, but also that there is no problem in exceeding the leap forward target of late rice surpassing early rice.

Xiangdong Commune has long cultivated double-season rice. However, due to the recurrent autumn droughts and insect pests that have plagued late rice over the years, coupled with limitations in labor and resources, cultivation has been rough, and late rice yields have consistently remained low. During the cooperativization movement, after much effort, late rice yields began to increase rapidly, but it was still impossible to completely change the fact that late rice yields were lower than those of early rice. As soon as the commune was established, it seized the lifeline of agricultural production, comprehensively planning the commune's water conservancy construction, and organizing a 10,000-strong army last winter to launch a "Huaihai Campaign" to massively repair and construct water conservancy projects. The commune has successively built 16 large and small reservoirs in the mountainous and hilly areas by utilizing valleys and narrow ridges, and comprehensively repaired, heightened, and reinforced the existing 731 reservoirs and ponds. The commune vigorously developed mechanized irrigation and established 29 electric and powered pumping stations. Thus, after a winter of construction, over 80% of the commune's paddy fields were able to withstand both drought and flood, and the remaining 20% of the fields had their drought resistance increased to more than 60 days. At the same time, the water disputes that existed in the past with the smaller cooperatives also disappeared. This laid a solid foundation for the whole year of rice cultivation to resist autumn drought.

Just as the rice seedlings were growing, the two major disasters of drought and insects arrived one after another, and the severity of the disasters was unprecedented in recent decades. The water conservancy projects and mechanical irrigation projects built by the commune successfully shouldered the task of fighting drought. The commune also implemented the "three concentrations" of leadership, labor, and machinery and conducted four consecutive insect prevention and elimination campaigns. After more than a month of fighting, the bumper harvest of late rice was finally secured.

### 大兴水利抗御旱涝灾害　集中人力药械防虫灭虫  湘东公社千亩晚稻超千斤

    大兴水利抗御旱涝灾害　集中人力药械防虫灭虫
    湘东公社千亩晚稻超千斤
    本报南昌3日电　江西省萍乡县湘东人民公社，继取得今年早稻大丰收之后，二万六千多亩双季晚稻又开镰见喜，普告大丰收。据现在收割的、并经过打、晒、车净之后验收的一千三百亩晚稻，平均每亩产量达到了一千零三斤。
    这些收割的晚稻，有平原的，也有山区的，有垅田的，也有冲田的，一般都比去年增产了60％至一倍。例如，枧田大队是平原地区，收割的六百多亩晚稻，亩产大部分在千斤到一千三百斤，新村大队并有十三亩连片田平均亩产达到了一千四百五十一斤。山区和丘陵区的大城、集中两个大队，原来土质差，产量最低，现在收割的几十亩冷浆田里的晚稻每亩产量也都超过了八百斤。
    湘东公社去年晚稻平均每亩产量是四百三十二斤，今年早稻平均每亩产量是六百四十八斤。根据今年晚稻收获的情况，干部和社员们一致公认：产量不仅可大大盖过去年晚稻，超额实现晚稻超早稻的跃进指标也毫无问题了。
    湘东公社长期以来就种植双季稻。但由于历年晚稻遭受秋旱和虫害，加上劳力、物力的限制，耕作粗糙，晚稻产量一直很低。在合作化中，经过许多努力，晚稻产量开始迅速提高，但也未能彻底改变它比早稻低产的面貌。公社一成立，即抓住了农业增产的命脉——全面规划了全社的水利建设，于去冬组织了一万大军，开展了大修大建水利工程的“淮海战役”。全社在山区和丘陵区利用山谷、狭垅先后建成的大小水库就有十六座，对旧有的七百三十一座水库、水塘也普遍进行了整修加高加固。公社大力发展了机械灌溉，建立了二十九个电力和动力的抽水机站。这样，经过一冬建设，全社80％以上的稻田便作到了水旱无忧，其余20％的田抗旱能力也都提高到了六十天以上。同时过去小社存在的水利纠纷也没有了。这就为全年水稻抗御秋旱打下了坚固的基础。
    正值禾苗生长期间，旱、虫两大灾害接踵到来了，而且严重程度是近几十年来没有的。公社兴建的水利工程和机械灌溉工程胜利地担负起了抗旱的任务。公社还实行了领导、劳力、药械“三集中”，连续开展了四次防虫灭虫战役。经过一个多月的战斗，终于保住了晚稻丰收。
