    For the Great Victory of Communism
    By A. Sofronov, Soviet Writer, Editor-in-Chief of "Spark" Magazine

    This summer, I visited one of the famous cities of the Urals—Nizhny Tagil. At that time, the steelworkers of Nizhny Tagil were putting the finishing touches on a new blast furnace. The completion of this blast furnace was not only a major event for the factory but also for the entire metallurgical industry. Now, the blast furnace has produced its first batch of iron. When I was in Nizhny Tagil, I talked to the installation workers and steelworkers. The high technical literacy of the people was striking, and this was true not only of engineers and technicians but also of the workers. This new type of technical equipment, as stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan, is about to be put into production, which arouses a special, communist sense of responsibility in people's hearts. It is not difficult to see the characteristics of our era from this.

    It can be boldly asserted that the great Seven-Year Plan adopted by the 21st Congress of the CPSU has become the personal plan of every Soviet person. The workers' consciousness and cultural level have been greatly improved. In Sverdlovsk, at the oldest machine-building factory in the Soviet Union, I had many conversations with young workers. In the past, most of the foundry workers did not have a high level of technical training. But what about today? Take the steelmaking workshop as an example; almost all the young workers have a medium-level technical education, and young men and women show soaring enthusiasm, joy, and concerted effort in their work. For me, a person who came through the First Five-Year Plan as a handyman and baker, all this is very clear. Yes, our country has traveled a long road, and it is no wonder that millions of people fought so selflessly under Lenin's banner for the freedom and independence of the motherland!

    Ordinary workers have become masters of their future and plan for the future based on the interests of the country. When you arrive at the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant, you seem to see this future, and you see the deep international friendship and solidarity that values love between people. A gear-milling worker at the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant invited me to his home and told me that he and his workmates in a communist labor team were manufacturing parts for excavators ordered by the People's Republic of China. He lives in a workers' town (in fact, this is not just a workers' town but a small city). We sat in his house, and he told me about his recent trip to Czechoslovakia, and I told him about my visit to China, mentioning the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Shenyang Machine Tool Factory. We were originally talking about how his team was working, how it was preparing to work, and how it was going to implement the Seven-Year Plan, but the topic gradually developed into the present and future of our people and our foreign friends and comrades. This is the era, and this is how the Soviet people think and feel!

    The figures of our country's Seven-Year Plan have been announced to the world. It makes the Soviet people proud and also makes them feel a great sense of responsibility, because they know that they have launched a competition with the capitalist world, and they know that victory belongs to the fighting, united socialist camp. That is why the steelworkers and miners, machine-building workers and textile workers, power workers and food workers who are working on the Seven-Year Plan front today are so enthusiastic and looking forward to the future; everything for the people, everything for the future, everything for the great victory of communism!

    I am writing this article on the eve of our great festival—the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Our country is preparing to celebrate the festival. Every day at dusk, the street lights and slogans are lit up—all the slogans illustrate one theme: peaceful labor, the great Seven-Year Plan. This is the thought and feeling of the Soviet people.

    Not long ago, our entire country warmly congratulated our Chinese brothers on the tenth anniversary of the founding of New China. N. S. Khrushchev led a Soviet government delegation to China and expressed his congratulations in Beijing. The photos published in thousands of newspapers and magazines vividly depicted the friendly meeting between Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev.

    Although we are in Moscow, we know in detail how our brothers are celebrating their great national day. We feel that every telegram and every congratulatory message of ours has reached the hands of our friends in Beijing, reached every city and village in China.

    What a great feeling it is, the feeling of fraternal solidarity between the people of our two countries!

    We also know now that our friends are always with us as we engage in the magnificent cause of the Seven-Year Plan!

    When Beijing held the "May 1st" parade on May 1, 1951, I wrote a poem on Tiananmen Square and broadcast it to Moscow via radio. Now I want to "send it back" to Beijing along with my friendly greetings:

    Look, we stand closely together:
    Smiling, watching, talking heart to heart.
    Every word comes from the bottom of our hearts.
    We stand shoulder to shoulder, we stand together.
    There is no distance between us!
    Beijing—Moscow, Moscow—Beijing.
    Our hearts are forever linked!

    Yes, in the past, present and future, whether in the struggle for the happiness of our two peoples or in the selfless labor for tomorrow, whether in the struggle for peace, the foundation of the prosperity and strength of our two great countries, or in the construction of the communist society instructed by the great Lenin's legacy, we are forever and ever together!

### 为了共产主义的伟大胜利

    为了共产主义的伟大胜利
    苏联作家  “星火”杂志总编辑  阿·梭甫罗诺夫
    今年夏天，我访问了乌拉尔的名城之一——下塔吉尔。当时下塔吉尔钢铁工人正在进行一座新高炉的收尾工程。建成这座高炉不仅是一个工厂的大事，而且是整个冶金工业部门的大事。现在，高炉已经炼出第一炉铁。我在下塔吉尔时曾经跟安装工人和钢铁工人谈过话。人们的高度技术素养真是触目可见，而且不仅工程师和技术员是如此，就是工人也是如此。七年计划中规定的这套新式技术装备，快要投入生产了，这在人们心里激起了一种特殊的、共产主义的责任感。从这里不难看出我们时代的特征。
    可以大胆地断言，苏共二十一次代表大会通过的伟大七年计划成了每个苏联人的个人计划。工人的觉悟和文化水平大大提高了。在斯维尔德洛夫斯克市苏联最老的一座机器制造工厂，我曾和青年工人进行过好多次谈话。从前，铸造车间工人大部分技术修养都不很高。而今天呢？就拿炼钢车间来说吧，几乎全体青年工人都具有中等技术教育水平，青年男女在劳动中表现了干劲冲天，喜气洋洋而且齐心协力。对于我，一个以杂工和面包工身份从第一个五年计划走过来的人，这一切都看得十分清楚。是的，我们的国家经历了漫长的道路，难怪千百万人民在列宁的旗帜下为争取祖国自由独立是那样忘我奋战！
    普通的工人变成了自己未来的主人，并从国家的利益出发计划着未来。到了乌拉尔重型机器厂，你就好像看到了这个未来一样，看到以人与人之间的爱为重的深厚国际友好和团结的感情。乌拉尔重型机器厂一位铣齿工人曾邀我到他家做客，告诉我说，他和同他在一个共产主义劳动队工作的工友们正在为中华人民共和国所定做的掘土机制造零件。他住在一个工人镇里（其实这不是什么工人镇，而是整整一座小城市）。我们坐在他的住宅里，他向我谈起他不久前到捷克斯洛伐克去的情形，我向他讲述了我在中国的见闻，谈到鞍山钢铁公司和沈阳机床制造厂。我们本来在谈他的工作队工作得怎样，它准备怎样工作和怎样执行七年计划，可是话题逐渐发展到我国人民以及我们外国朋友和同志的今天和未来了。现在的时代就是这样，苏联人民的思想和感情也就是这样！
    我国七年计划的数字已公布于世。它使苏联人民感到自豪，也使他们感到责任的重大，因为他们知道，他们已经跟资本主义世界展开了竞赛，他们知道，胜利属于战斗的、统一的社会主义阵营。正因为如此，今天在七年计划战线上劳动着的钢铁工人和矿工，机器制造工人和纺织工人，动力工人和食品工人，都是如此热情高涨，都在展望着未来；一切为了人民，一切为了未来，一切为了共产主义的伟大胜利！
    我这篇文章写于我们的伟大节日——伟大十月社会主义革命四十二周年的前夕。我们的国家正在准备过节。每天一到傍晚，街头的电灯标语便点燃起来——所有的标语都说明一个主题：和平的劳动，伟大的七年计划。这就是苏联人民的思想和感情。
    不久以前，我们全国刚刚热烈的向中国兄弟祝贺过新中国诞生的十周年。尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫曾率领苏联政府代表团到了中国，并在北京表示了他的祝贺。成千上万的报章杂志上所刊登的照片，鲜明的表现了毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志的友好会见。
    我们虽然身在莫斯科，但是我们详细的知道我们的弟兄们庆祝他们伟大国庆的情形。我们觉得我们的每一贺电和每一贺词都到达了北京朋友们的手里，到达了中国的每个城市和乡村。
    我们两国人民之间的友爱团结感情，这是多么伟大的感情呵！
    我们现在也知道，在我们从事七年计划的宏伟事业时，我们的朋友时刻都和我们在一起！
    1951年5月1日北京举行“五一”游行的时候，我曾在天安门广场上写了一首诗，并且把它通过无线电广播播送到莫斯科。现在我想把它随着友好的问候一同“送回”北京：
    看呵，我们紧密地站在一起：
    微笑着，注视着，握手谈心。
    句句话语出自心底。
    我们肩并着肩，我们站在一起。
    我们之间没有丝毫距离！
    北京——莫斯科，莫斯科——北京。
    我们永远心连着心！
    是的，过去、现在和将来，不论是在争取我们两国人们幸福的斗争里或是在为了明天的忘我劳动里，不论是在争取和平上，我们两个强大国家繁荣昌盛的基础——的斗争里或伟大列宁遗训所指示的共产主义社会的建设里，我们永远永远在一起！
