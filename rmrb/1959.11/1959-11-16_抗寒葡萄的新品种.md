New Cold-Resistant Grape Varieties

Grapes are one of China's important fruit trees. However, in northern China, due to low winter temperatures, they must be buried for winter protection every year. This not only consumes a lot of labor, but also often damages some buds and branches during the burying and unearthing operations, affecting growth and fruit production. In order to cultivate new grape varieties that can withstand temperatures of -25℃, are of excellent quality, and are suitable for winemaking, without the need for winter burial in North China, the Beijing Botanical Garden of the Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, has selected twenty excellent hybrid plants after several years of trials and two years of open-field overwintering tests as the first batch of new cold-resistant varieties. These hybrid plants have undergone preliminary testing in open fields overwintering at -19.8℃. More than 80% of their buds can germinate, grow, and bear fruit normally after overwintering in the open field. Under the low temperature of -16.3℃ in the winter of 1958-1959, the bud germination rate of overwintering plants reached 100%. It is expected that in the near future, it will be possible to cultivate grapes without burial in the vast northern regions of our country.

The fact that these hybrid plants not only have high overwintering properties but also excellent fruit-bearing characteristics powerfully breaks the superstition that "it is unlikely to cultivate good varieties in the first generation of crosses between cultivated and wild varieties."

    抗寒葡萄的新品种
    葡萄为我国重要果树之一。但在我国北部由于冬季气温低，每年必须埋土防寒。这不仅耗费大量劳力，而且在埋土、出土操作过程中常使部分芽眼、枝蔓受损，影响生长结果。为了育成能抗负25℃的低温、品质优良、适于酿造，在华北一带不需埋土防寒的葡萄新品种，中国科学院植物研究所北京植物园，经过几年试验已选出二十株经过二年露地越冬考验的优良杂种植株作为第一批抗寒新品种，这些杂种植株已经过负19.8℃的露地越冬的初步考验。它们80％以上的芽眼于露地越冬后均能正常的萌发、生长和结实。1958—1959年冬季负16.3℃的低温条件下，越冬植株芽眼萌发率达100％。预计不久的将来，在我国广大的北部地区有可能实现不需进行埋土的葡萄栽培了。
    这些杂种植株不但具有较高的越冬性，而且具有优良的结实特性的事实，有力地打破了“栽培品种与野生品种杂交，第一代不大可能培育出好品种”的迷信。
