    The Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture has witnessed an unprecedented new situation of national unity, prosperity, and progress after the democratic reforms and cooperativization. On the new socialist economic foundation, national unity is developing and consolidating day by day.

    The Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, located in the Greater and Lesser Liangshan areas, was historically known for its severe divisions between ethnic groups and internal feuds. Since the establishment of the autonomous prefecture, ethnic relations in this area have greatly improved, and internal feuds have essentially ceased. The democratic reforms in the autonomous prefecture eliminated the slave owner class, thereby completely eradicating the root causes of discord between and within ethnic groups, enabling the autonomous prefecture's national unity to enter a new stage of development.

    Since liberation, Han cadres working in the autonomous prefecture have formed deep friendships with the Yi people. With the comprehensive development of socialist construction in the autonomous prefecture, a large number of Han cadres, technicians, workers, and teachers have come to Liangshan to support the Yi people, with over three thousand in the industrial sector alone. Han cadres work diligently and arduously alongside the Yi people. Han cadres working in rural areas have generally implemented the "three togethers" with Yi farmers: eating together, living together, and working together, helping to promote advanced agricultural technologies and improve the management of people's communes and agricultural cooperatives. In Guangming Cooperative in Meigu County, Han cadres insisted on cultivating experimental plots and leading by example to help Yi cooperative members learn advanced technologies. The entire cooperative successively promoted a series of technological reforms, such as deep plowing, fertilization, the use of improved seeds, and rational close planting, doubling production in just two years. Yao Xinggui, a Han female accountant from Hongxi County, travels on rugged mountain roads all year round, regardless of wind, frost, rain, or snow. She learned the Yi language and has helped eight Yi accountants in the cooperatives learn bookkeeping and improve their financial management systems. As a result, the vast number of Yi people love and trust Han cadres even more. In many places in Xide County, Yi cooperative members warmly give Han cadres Yi names, care about their daily lives, and actively learn techniques and work hard in production, treating each other like family.

    In the past, the reactionary Han rulers incited people by saying, "It's better to beat a barbarian once than to respect them an inch." Yi slave owners said, "Stones cannot be used as pillows, and Han people cannot be trusted as friends." After the democratic reforms, many national joint cooperatives were established throughout the prefecture, fundamentally changing the situation of ethnic segregation. In production and construction, farmers of all ethnic groups help each other, cooperate with each other, and care for each other in life. Han farmers help Yi farmers learn production techniques for planting rice, wheat, and rapeseed, as well as water conservancy construction and blasting techniques, while Yi farmers support Han farmers with labor. Xinmin and Zhongsuo national joint cooperatives in Yuexi County moved some Yi cooperative members living in high and cold mountainous areas to the dam area. Han cooperative members enthusiastically adjusted land and vacated houses, and even opened special Yi canteens. In the past, Han cooperative members of the Guangfu Squad of the Longtan Brigade of the Xinmin Commune had their water conservancy projects destroyed by Yi slave owners on nearby mountains. Last year, however, Yi cooperative members from the mountains took the initiative to send people to help, quickly repairing a large dam that could irrigate more than 90,000 mu of farmland. During last year's autumn harvest, Han and Yi farmers also supported each other.

    The sound of vendetta guns has disappeared in the vast Yi-inhabited areas. Butuo County was once a well-known place for vendettas. During the democratic reforms, the working masses recognized the fundamental cause of vendettas: the slave owners used the clan system to plunder property. People broke the boundaries of vendettas and clans and actively established agricultural cooperatives. Muer Township and Jiudu Township in this county had more than two hundred people die in vendettas in the past, but last year they all joined the same commune. In last year's autumn plowing and sowing and this year's production, many former enemies have carried out large-scale cooperation. Sikai Township and Sangang Township in Zhaojue County were long-time enemies, but now they have become good friends. When Sangang Township heard that Sikai Township was having difficulties during the rice harvest, it immediately dispatched more than 450 people with plows and farm tools to Sikai Township. The farmers of Sikai Township enthusiastically made beds, found straw mats, brewed tea, and delivered water. In more than half a month of joint labor, many people became close friends. In the past, enemies did not marry each other, but now marriages between them are very common.

### 彝族弟兄增进团结　汉族人民热情帮助  凉山人民阔步奔向幸福前程

    彝族弟兄增进团结　汉族人民热情帮助
    凉山人民阔步奔向幸福前程
    本报讯　凉山彝族自治州经过民主改革和合作化以后，出现了一个空前的民族团结、繁荣进步的新局面。在新的社会主义经济基础上，民族团结日益发展和巩固。
    凉山彝族自治州所在的大小凉山地区，历史上曾以民族之间的严重隔阂和民族内部冤家械斗著称。自治州建立以后，这一地区民族关系已有很大改善，民族内部冤家械斗已基本上停止。自治州的民主改革消灭了奴隶主阶级，从而彻底地消除了产生民族间和民族内部不和的根源，使自治州民族团结跨进了新的发展阶段。
    解放后，在自治州工作的汉族干部和彝族人民已结成了深厚的友谊。随着自治州社会主义建设的全面开展，大批汉族干部、技术人员、工人、教师来到凉山支援彝族人民，仅工业战线就已达三千多人。汉族干部勤勤恳恳和彝族人民一道艰苦地工作和劳动。在农村工作的汉族干部普遍实行了和彝族农民同吃、同住、同劳动，帮助推广先进农业技术，搞好人民公社和农业社的经营管理。美姑县光明社的汉族干部为了帮助彝族社员学习先进技术，坚持种试验田，带头示范，全社先后推广了深耕、施肥、采用良种、实行合理密植等一系列技术改革，两年内生产提高了一倍多。洪溪县汉族女会计员姚兴贵整年奔走在崎岖山道上，不顾风霜雨雪。学会彝族话，先后帮助八个社的彝族会计学会记账，健全了财务管理制度。广大彝族人民因此更加热爱和信任汉族干部。喜德县不少地方彝族社员热情地为汉族干部取上彝族名字，关心他们的起居饮食，积极学习技术，努力生产，相处如同家人。
    从前，汉族反动统治者煽动说：“敬蛮一寸，不如打蛮一顿。”彝族奴隶主说：“石头不能当枕头，汉人不能当朋友。”民主改革后全州建立了许多民族联合社，这种民族隔阂的状况根本改变了。在生产建设中，各族农民互相帮助、互相协作，生活上互相关心。汉族农民帮助彝族农民学习种植水稻、小麦、油菜等生产技术，学水利施工、爆破，彝族农民支援汉族农民劳力。越西县新民、中所等民族联合社把一些居住在高寒深山的彝族社员搬到坝区，汉族社员们热情地调剂土地，让出房屋，还专门开办了彝族食堂。新民公社龙潭大队广福小队的汉族社员过去修水利被附近山上彝族奴隶主破坏，而去年山上彝族社员主动派人支援，很快就修好一条可灌溉九万多亩耕地的大堰。去年秋收中，彝汉农民也互相支援。
    广大彝族聚居区的打冤家枪声绝迹了。布拖县过去是有名的打冤家地方。民主改革中，劳动群众认清了产生冤家的根本原因，是奴隶主利用家支制度掠夺财产。人们打破了冤家和家支界限，积极建立农业社。这个县的木耳乡和九都乡过去打冤家死过二百多人，但去年就都加入了同一个公社。在去年秋耕秋种和今年生产中，许多过去的冤家间都开展了大协作。昭觉县四开乡和三岗乡是多年的冤家，现在却成为好朋友，在收割水稻的时候三岗乡听说四开乡有困难，立刻出动了四百五十多人带着耕牛和农具到四开乡，四开乡农民也热情地腾床、找铺草、烧茶、送水，在半个多月的共同劳动中，许多人结成了亲密的朋友。过去冤家之间不结亲，现在男婚女嫁，已经十分普遍。
