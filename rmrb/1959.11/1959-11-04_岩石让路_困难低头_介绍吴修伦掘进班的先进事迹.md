Rocks Give Way, Difficulties Bow Their Heads
    ——Introducing the Advanced Deeds of Wu Xiulun's Tunneling Team

    The Wu Xiulun Tunneling Team of the Xuzhou Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau in Jiangsu Province has a total of seventy-eight workers, including nine Party members and twenty-seven Youth League members. Since its establishment in March 1954, this team has been responsible for the capital construction tasks of coal mine shaft excavation and roadway development. Over the past five years, from Huainan to Xuzhou, they have won national championships almost every year and set new national records wherever they go. In terms of shaft sinking, they achieved a monthly progress of 38.112 meters in the No. 2 well of Xieji Coal Mine in Huainan in 1954, winning the national championship for rapid shaft sinking. In 1957, they achieved a monthly progress of 62.02 meters in the large-diameter shaft of No. 1 well of Dahuangshan Coal Mine in Xuzhou, winning the national championship again. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, they created a national record of 160.92 meters per month in the main shaft of the Quantai vertical shaft. The speed of roadway development was even more astonishing. In 1954, the monthly progress of rock roadways was only about 30 meters. After 1954, they continuously created new national records of 190 meters per month for rock roadways and 488.46 meters per month for coal roadways. In March of this year, they created a new national record of 535.5 meters per month for single-heading rock roadways at the Quantai Coal Mine. Over the past five years, they have participated in the construction of five pairs of modern large-scale mines, excavating a total of 336.4 meters of shafts and 11,325 meters of roadways, equivalent to the entire project of a surface mine with an annual output of 600,000 tons. Such a mine required 500 workers to build for ten years before liberation, while Wu Xiulun's team, with an average of about 30 people, only worked for more than five years.

    First Championship

    The Wu Xiulun Tunneling Team became such an advanced team through the education and cultivation of the Party and the efforts of everyone, growing step by step.

    In 1954, the Wu Xiulun team was newly established, and their first battle was to participate in the capital construction project of China's first self-designed large-scale mine - the No. 2 well of Xieji Coal Mine in Huainan. The cross-section of this mine was large, the rock was hard, and there were many faults, making the conditions complex, especially the south haulage roadway, which was all sandstone and conglomerate. Even technicians of the seventh or eighth grade could only advance one meter per day. The workers said: "Xieji No. 2 well is really strange. You only hear the sound of explosions, but you don't see any slag coming out." Wu Xiulun and his tunneling team, whose most skilled workers were only at the fifth grade at the time, did face difficulties in doing this work. But they were not afraid of any difficulties. Full of confidence, they requested this task from the Party branch. As soon as they started, they encountered the difficulty of slow blasting, which prevented them from advancing further. Blasting became the key to advancing further. Wu Xiulun then consulted with several blasters and found that the main reason for slow blasting was slow drilling. In response to this situation, they proposed increasing the air pressure and using several pneumatic drills to drill simultaneously in two rows, one above the other. The Party committee supported their suggestion. They then increased the number of pneumatic drills from four to eight on the 14-meter large cross-section. Two workers held one pneumatic drill each, standing and drilling the top holes, while two workers held the pneumatic drills, lying on the ground and drilling the bottom holes. This indeed improved efficiency. However, the rapid progress also brought the problem of lagging support installation. Therefore, they repeatedly studied and exerted collective wisdom, and created the advanced heading method. The excavation speed increased from one meter per day to four or five meters. At the same time, they carried out cross-operation competitions on the left and right sides of the working face, finally creating a national record of 130.3 meters per month for rock roadway excavation in a 14.75-square-meter large cross-section, and won the honorary title of "Advanced Tunneling Team" awarded by the Ministry of Coal Industry.

    A Complete Set of Advanced Experience

    In 1958, the Wu Xiulun team was put into the well construction project of Quantai Coal Mine. "Take steel as the key link, make an all-round leap forward, two tons of coal is one ton of steel, sink wells quickly and produce coal early" has become the urgent task of every miner to support steel production. At this time, the national record of 62 meters per month for well sinking of the Wu Xiulun team had been left behind by the 109 meters per month achieved by the Wangshi'ao Engineering Office in Tongchuan. In order to catch up with and surpass the Wangshi'ao Engineering Office, they put forward the slogan of ensuring 150 meters of progress per month. Before liberation, it took two or three years to sink an 80-meter shaft. Now, they wanted to sink 150 or 160 meters per month. Some workers at the time did not believe it could be achieved. Wu Xiulun thought: "As long as we learn and promote advanced experience, this plan can definitely be achieved." However, according to regulations, concrete had to be used to reinforce the shaft every 50 meters of excavation, which affected the progress by five or six days per month. Wu Xiulun started to think about this: Could the reinforcement time be reduced - reinforce once every 120 meters? The method was thought out, but they were afraid it would not be safe. So he found several veteran workers to study it together. The workers said: "According to the geological strata and the amount of water inflow, we can take measures such as adding support rings and filling the empty sides to ensure safety." Sure enough, after adopting this measure, the efficiency of bricklaying was safely increased by more than doubled. This fact not only educated the workers, but also educated Wu Xiulun himself. Therefore, a wave of breaking superstitions, liberating minds, and boldly innovating was launched in the whole team. As a result, the whole team put forward a total of 3,421 reasonable suggestions in one year, of which the four major items saved the country 77,182 yuan.

    Since entering 1959, they have accepted the successful experience of 1958, earnestly studied the advanced experience of Datong Coal Mine in creating 413 meters, and combined it with the experience of their own team to formulate a plan for promoting advanced experience and creating new records. Then, according to the production development of each squad, they closely grasped the method of timely evaluation, summary, and exchange of experience to continuously consolidate and improve, so that advanced experience could blossom and bear fruit everywhere. The Wu Xiulun team used the method of summarizing and promoting - consolidating and improving, then summarizing and promoting - then consolidating and improving, and successively promoted more than 30 kinds of advanced experience, carried out more than 120 important reforms, accumulated and enriched the systematic and complete set of advanced experience in coal mine tunneling such as multi-cycle, deep-hole blasting, multi-drill zoning drilling, hollow blasting, multi-process parallel cross-operation, etc., and became a valuable asset for the country's coal production cause, making important contributions to the country's coal production cause.

    Every Second Counts, Every Inch Matters

    In the underground strata, the Wu Xiulun team can excavate 20 meters in 24 hours, which is inseparable from the ten major parallel operation experiences they have accumulated over the years.

    As early as 1954, when they created a new national record in the Xieji Coal Mine in Huainan, they had already initially explored the experience of cross-operation of the same type of work. After coming to the Dahuangshan Coal Mine in 1957, in order to respond to the call of the Party committee to "hand over production half a year ahead of schedule," the Wu Xiulun team, under the direct leadership and help of the Party committee secretary, held a worker symposium and summarized the experiences of combining rock removal and ring installation, technicians drilling holes, strong workers filling the well sides, hoisting pumps during charging, drilling and charging at the same time, blowing holes and charging at the same time, putting people up when loading cannons, and simultaneously lowering the吊泵 and installing rock loaders when sweeping the rings, etc. Later, they conducted new research every time they undertook a new project, and after continuous supplementation, it developed into ten major parallel operations. Due to the implementation of ten major parallel operations, the working face has reached a dozen types of work, and only four processes occupy operating time. It only takes seventy minutes to complete one cycle. The on-site work is also arranged in an orderly manner, one link after another, without any loopholes, and without wasting any time. This greatly compressed the cycle time, increasing it from three or four cycles per shift to seven cycles, and at most eight cycles.

    Large-Scale Collaboration, Large-Scale Competition

    Continuously carrying out competitions to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced is also an important experience for the Wu Xiulun Tunneling Team to continuously create miracles. In 1954, under the slogan of "Learn from Tongchuan, Catch up with Tongchuan, Surpass Tongchuan," the Wu Xiulun team became a competitor with the Wangshi'ao Engineering Office in Tongchuan. In 1958, the national coal workers launched a competition upsurge. They and the Wangshi'ao Engineering Office launched an initiative to the whole country and agreed to "see who is better on October 1st." In the first round, Wangshi'ao won the championship with a monthly progress of 109 meters. In order to catch up with Wangshi'ao, the Wu Xiulun team put forward the resounding slogan of "Hand over Dahuangshan on August 1st, and sink Quantai wells to catch up with Tongchuan." In September, they cooperated with brother teams to create a new record of 115.5 meters per month for well sinking in the Quantai auxiliary shaft. In October, the Wu Xiulun team, with the large-scale collaboration and support of the entire work area, created a national record of 160.92 meters per month for well sinking.

    But when they regained the championship for the new record of well sinking, the new record for roadway development was snatched away by the new record of 413 meters per month created by the Yungang Mine of Datong. Therefore, after discussion, the workers of the whole team formulated measures and guarantee conditions, and launched a competition upsurge of "Learn from Yungang, Catch up with Yungang, Set the target at 450 meters, and vow to take the lead in the country again." The water dripping on the face was large, and the workers put forward the bold statement that "The dripping water is not as big as our determination, and the sandstone is not as strong as our will." In order to catch up with the cycle, competitions were launched between processes. The track layers created the advanced experience of pre-nailing track boards, nailing the tracks in just ten minutes, ensuring transportation. The rock loader operators ensured fast loading, and the car pushers ensured fast pushing. The competition momentum between the three shifts became bigger and bigger. Zhao Chuansheng took the lead with a shift progress of 8.5 meters. Zhang Xiangde did not catch up on the first day, but studied the operation in advance on the second day, and as a result, created a record of 10 meters of progress per shift. Finally, the first shift created a record of 12.5 meters. They proposed in early October to advance 450 meters per month. When the progress increased from 6 meters per shift to 7.3 meters per shift in mid-October, the workers sang: "Surging enthusiasm is a treasure, technical innovation breaks the target, with the Party's good leadership, 500 meters is inevitable." The workers automatically wanted to break the 500-meter barrier. By late October, the average daily progress reached 22 meters, and the highest reached 34 meters. Everyone then put forward the goal of striving for 530 meters. As a result, they created a new record of 535.5 meters for the whole month.

    Helping the Backward Become Advanced

    The reason why the Wu Xiulun team has been able to continuously create new national records eight times and consistently maintain an advanced team is that the backbone of the team has played a decisive role.

    They closely rely on the leadership of the Party, listen to the Party, and promptly report major issues in the team to the Party committee. When doing ideological work, the Party committee works with them to analyze the reasons and study the solutions. They consult the Party committee in advance before embarking on a new project in order to better implement the Party's instructions. When encountering difficulties in production, they tell the difficulties to the Party committee, rely on the leadership of the Party, and work with comrades in the group to find ways to overcome the difficulties. In the Dahuangshan project, the on-site management was chaotic, and the planned progress was 1.8 meters, but the actual progress was only 1.2 meters. Team leader Wu Xiulun reported this situation to the Party committee. The Party committee instructed them to clarify the division of labor, strengthen cooperation, and helped them summarize the experience of seven major parallel operations. As a result, they not only completed the 1.8-meter target, but also created a new national record.

    The backbone of their team always leads by example and motivates the masses to overcome difficulties together. The first to appear in the most difficult places are always Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. Repairing the well rings is the most difficult work. It is necessary to be suspended in the air with a safety belt. Team leader Wu Xiulun always rushes to do this work. In the red May of 1958, when they were doing uphill excavation in the Dahuangshan West Haulage Road, the slope was very steep, ranging from 45 degrees to 75 degrees, and there was water at the bottom. It was slippery even with bare hands. The original plan was to transport materials from the ventilation shaft, but unfortunately, because the design of the ventilation shaft was not thorough, it was not opened. What to do without wood? To use a winch? No. To carry it manually? The materials were seven or eight feet long and had to be carried one by one, which made everyone worry. Squad leader Zhang Xiangde is a Communist Youth League member. He never bows his head in the face of difficulties. He took the lead and carried a large piece of wood, being the first to climb up. Under his leadership, the task was successfully completed.

    The backbone of the team is as united as one person. Every month, the three shift leaders hold regular meetings three or four times. Everyone sits down to discuss work and conduct criticism. This has never been interrupted for several years. When workers encounter difficulties, they immediately find ways to solve them. Worker Jiang Chuanzhao encountered difficulties on the 25th of one month because of a poorly planned life. Team leader Yang Duoyuan tried to help him solve the difficulties. Jiang Chuanzhao said with emotion: "In the future, I will definitely produce better and learn to arrange my life at the same time."

    Helping the backward become advanced is the conscious action of the Party and League members in this team. Before worker Lin Jiaxin came to this team, he often asked for leave for excuses and was often absent from work. After being transferred to this team, the team introduced him to the examples of how this team created national records, and Party member Xiao Fengming worked with Lin Jiaxin to influence him with his own practical actions. As a result, Lin Jiaxin not only overcame his shortcomings, but also worked very enthusiastically and often overfulfilled his tasks.

    Because the political and ideological work of this team is done well, the political enthusiasm of the masses is high, the enthusiasm is great, the mood is comfortable, and the will is unified, the workers all say: "Our team leader has a good democratic style. He consults with us first on everything. No matter how many difficulties there are, we are willing to work with Wu Xiulun."

    岩石让路　困难低头
    ——介绍吴修伦掘进班的先进事迹
    江苏省徐州煤矿基本建设局吴修伦掘进班共有七十八个工人，其中党员九人，团员二十七人。这个班从1954年3月成立以来，一直担负着煤矿的井筒开凿和平巷开拓的基建任务。五年来，他们从淮南到徐州，差不多年年都夺得全国冠军，到哪里就在哪里创造全国新纪录。在井筒掘进方面，1954年在淮南谢家集二号井，井筒月进三十八点一一二米，获得全国井筒快速掘进的冠军。1957年，在徐州大黄山一号井，大直径井筒月进六十二点零二米，再夺全国冠军。大跃进的1958年，他们创造了权台竖井主井月进一百六十点九二米的全国最高纪录。平巷掘进的速度更为惊人，在1954年岩石大巷进度每月不过三十米左右，在1954年以后连续创造了月进一百九十米、煤巷月进四百八十八点四六米的全国新纪录。今年3月，在权台煤矿创造了岩石大巷独头月进五百三十五点五米的最高全国新纪录。五年来，他们先后参加了五对现代化大型矿井的建设，共掘井筒三百三十六点四米，平巷掘进共一万一千三百二十五米，相当于一个年产六十万吨的旱采矿的全部工程。这样的矿井，解放前需要五百名工人建设十年，而吴修伦班平均三十人左右，只干了五年多。
    首夺冠军
    吴修伦掘进班成为这样一个先进班，是在党的教育和培养下，经过大家的努力，一步一步地成长起来的。
    1954年，吴修伦班刚成立，第一仗就投入了我国自己设计的第一对大型矿井——淮南谢家集二号井的基建工程。这个矿井的断面大，岩石硬，断层多，条件复杂，特别是南运道，全是沙石岩。七、八级的技术工，也不过日进一米。工人们说：“谢二井真奇怪，只听炮声响，不见碴出来。”吴修伦和他的掘进班，当时技术最高的不过五级，干这活儿并不是没有困难的。但是他们什么困难也不怕。他们满怀信心，向党总支要求了这个任务。一上去，他们就碰到了放炮放得慢、不能多进尺的困难。放炮成了多进尺的关键。吴修伦便找几个放炮员研究，找出了放炮慢的主要原因是打眼慢。针对这个情况，他们提出了加大风压，多用几部风钻分上下两行同时打眼的建议。党委支持了他们的建议。他们便在十四米的大断面上由四部风钻增加到八部风钻，两个工人抱一台风钻站着打顶眼，两个工人抱着风钻匍匐在地上打下眼。这样效率果然提高了。但是，由于进度快又带来了扶棚跟不上的问题，于是，他们便反复研究，发挥集体智慧，又创造了超前掏槽法，掘进速度由一天一米提高到四米、五米，同时在工作面上又开展左右两帮的交叉作业竞赛，终于创造了十四点七五平方大断面月进了一百三十点三米的岩巷掘进的全国最高纪录，获得了煤炭工业部授给的“先进掘进班”的荣誉称号。
    成套的先进经验
    1958年，吴修伦班投入了权台煤矿建井工程。“以钢为纲，全面跃进，两吨煤，就是一吨钢，快打井，早出煤”，已成为每一个矿工支援钢铁生产的迫切任务。这时吴修伦班月进成井六十二米的全国纪录，已经被铜川王石凹工程处的月进成井一百零九米抛在后边了。为了赶上王石凹工程处，超过王石凹工程处，他们提出了保证月进一百五十米的口号。在解放前，打一个八十米的井筒需要二、三年，现在一个月要打一百五、六十米，有的工人当时不大相信能够实现。吴修伦想：“只要学习和推广先进经验，这个计划一定能够实现。”但是，按规程规定，每掘进五十米要用混凝土生一次根，这样一个月影响五、六天的进度。吴修伦就在这上面动起脑筋来：能不能够减少生根时间——一百二十米生一次根？办法想出来了，就怕不安全，于是他就找几个老工人一起研究。工人说：“根据地质的岩层和涌水量情况，我们采取加腰圈，把空帮填实，一定能够保证安全。”果然，采取这个措施以后，砌?效率安全地提高了一倍多。这个事实，不仅教育了工人，同时也教育了吴修伦自己，于是全班中掀起了一个破除迷信，解放思想，大胆革新的热潮。结果，一年中，全班共提出了三千四百二十一条合理化建议，其中的四大项就为国家节约了七万七千一百八十二元。
    进入1959年以来，他们接受了1958年成功的经验，认真学习了大同煤矿创造四百一十三米的先进经验，并且结合本班的经验，制订了推广先进经验、创造新纪录的规划。接着，根据各小班的生产发展情况，紧紧掌握了及时评比总结，交流经验，不断巩固提高的方法，使先进经验遍地开花结果。吴修伦班运用了总结推广——巩固提高，再总结推广——再巩固提高的方法，先后推广了三十多种先进经验，进行了一百二十多项重要改革，积累和丰富了煤矿掘进方面多循环、深眼爆破、多台钻分区打眼、空心爆破、多工序平行交叉作业等等系统的成套的先进经验，成为煤矿基建生产的宝贵财富，为国家的煤炭生产事业作出了重要的贡献。
    分秒必争　尺寸不让
    在地下岩层里，吴修伦班在二十四小时内能掘进二十米，这是和他们几年来积累得来的十大平行作业的经验分不开的。
    早在1954年，在淮南谢二集煤矿创造全国新纪录时，他们已经初步摸出了同工种交叉作业的经验。1957年来到大黄山煤矿后，为了响应党委提出的“提前半年移交生产”的号召，吴修伦班在党委书记的直接领导和帮助下，召开工人座谈会，总结出了出岩和挂圈结合，技术工打眼，壮工充填井帮，装药时起吊泵，一边打眼、一边装药，一边吹眼、一边装药，装炮时上人，扫圈时同时向下松吊泵和装岩机等七大平行作业的经验。以后，他们每进行一次新工程，就进行一次新的研究，经过不断的补充，发展成为十大平行作业。由于推行了十大平行作业，工作面达十几个工种，占用作业时间的只有四个工序，走一个循环只要七十分钟。现场工作也安排得井井有条，一环扣一环，不出一点漏洞，不空滑过分秒时间。这样就把循环时间大大压缩了下来，由一班三、四个循环提高到七个循环，最多到八个循环。
    大协作　大竞赛
    不断开展比先进，学先进，赶先进竞赛，这也是吴修伦掘进班连续创奇迹的重要经验。1954年，吴修伦班在“学铜川、赶铜川、超铜川”口号下，和铜川王石凹工程处成了竞赛对手。1958年全国煤炭职工掀起了竞赛高潮，他们和王石凹工程处向全国发起了倡议，并约定“十·一见高低”。第一回合，王石凹取得月进一百零九米的冠军。为了赶上王石凹，吴修伦班就提出了“八一移交大黄山，权台成井赶铜川”的响亮口号。9月份，他们配合兄弟班，创造了权台副井月进成井一百一十五点五米的最高纪录。10月份，吴修伦班在全工区大协作、大支援下，创造了一百六十点九二米的月进成井全国纪录。
    但当他们把打井筒新纪录冠军夺回来时，平巷掘进的新纪录又被大同云岗矿创造的月进四百一十三米新纪录夺去了。于是，全班工人经过讨论制定措施和保证条件，掀起了“学云岗，赶云岗，指标四百五十，誓在全国再领先”的竞赛热潮。面上淋水大，工人提出“淋水没有我们决心大，砂岩没有我们的意志坚”的豪言壮语。为了赶循环，工序之间展开了竞赛，钉道工创造了预钉道板的先进经验，在短短的十分钟内就钉好了道，保证了运输。装岩机手保证装得快，推车工保证推得快，你追我赶。三班之间的竞赛劲头，越比越大。赵传胜以班进八点五米领先，张祥德头一天没追上去，第二天事先研究操作，结果创造出班进十米的纪录，最后，一小班创出十二点五米的纪录。他们上旬提出，月进四百五十米，到中旬由班进六米提高到班进七点三米时，工人就唱道：“冲天干劲宝中宝，技术革新破指标，有了党的好领导，五百米跑不了。”工人自动要闯五百大关，到下旬平均日进达到二十二米，最高到三十四米，大家又提出了力争五百三十米的奋斗目标。结果，全月创造了五百三十五点五米的最新纪录。
    帮助落后变先进
    吴修伦班所以能够连续八次创造全国新纪录，一贯地保持先进班，班里的骨干起了决定作用。
    他们紧紧依靠党的领导，听党的话，班里的重大问题及时向党委汇报。做思想工作时，党委与他们一起，分析原因，研究办法。他们投入一项新的工程，都事先请示党委，以便更好地贯彻党的指示精神。生产上碰到困难时，就把困难告诉党委，依靠党的领导，和小组里同志一起想办法克服困难。在大黄山工程中，现场管理混乱，计划进度一点八米，实际只达到一点二米。班长吴修伦把这个情况向党委作了汇报，党委指示他们要明确分工，加强协作，并帮助他们总结七大平行作业的经验，结果不仅完成了一点八米的指标，而且创造了全国新纪录。
    他们班里的骨干都处处以身作则，带动群众一起克服困难。在最艰苦的地方，第一个出现的总是共产党员、共青团员。修理井圈是最艰苦的活，要用安全带吊起悬空作业，这个活老是班长吴修伦抢着干。1958年红5月，他们在大黄山西轧道做上山掘进时，坡度很大，有四十五度到七十五度，还有底板水，空着手都是一步一滑。这个地方运料，原计划是从风井向下送，不巧，因为风井的设计不周，没打通。没有木料怎么办呢？要绞车吧，没有。用人工扛吧，七、八尺长的料，要一棵一棵背，大伙对着这个困难发愁。小班长张祥德是共青团员，见了困难从不低头，他就自己先干，扛起一棵大木料，头一个向上爬。在他带动下，顺利地完成了任务。
    班里的骨干，团结得像一个人一样。每月之中，三个班的班长定期召开三、四次会议，大家坐下来讨论工作，开展批评，几年来从未间断过。工人发生了困难，他们就立即想办法解决。工人江传照因为生活计划不周，有一次到二十五日发生了困难。班长杨多元就想办法帮助他解决困难。江传照感动地说：“今后我一定要更好地生产，同时学会安排生活。”
    帮助落后变先进，是这个班党团员的自觉行动。工人林家新到这个班里以前，经常借故请假，旷工也是常事。调到这个班里以后，班里向他介绍了本班如何创造全国纪录的事例，并由党员萧凤鸣和林家新在一起干活，以自己实际行动影响他。结果林家新不但克服了缺点，而且干起活来干劲很大，经常超额完成任务。
    由于这个班的政治思想工作做得好，群众的政治热情高，干劲大，心情舒畅，意志统一，工人们都说：“我们班长民主作风好，有什么事都先和我们商量，困难再多我们也乐意跟着吴修伦干。”
