Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 20th: The Japanese Communist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), and the Socialist Party recently decided to jointly distribute ten million posters and leaflets opposing the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" nationwide on the 27th – the Eighth National Unified Action Day.

    The "Akahata" newspaper published an editorial today on this matter, stating that according to this decision, the JCP has already distributed one million leaflets to local organizations at the prefectural level.

    The editorial emphasized that this is an unprecedented achievement in the history of the Japanese struggle, and also an action that conforms to crushing the criminal conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionary forces to revise the "Security Treaty." "Akahata" called on all JCP organizations and members to stand at the forefront of this joint action, and through this action strive to develop the unified struggle against the "Security Treaty," including the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, and further deepen the idea of the united front among the broad masses of the people.

    The unified slogans in the leaflets distributed by the JCP include: Stop the revision of the "Security Treaty" and immediately cease Japan-U.S. negotiations.

    The leaflets also include the following seven slogans proposed separately by the Japanese Communist Party: Support the proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Japan, support the verdict on the "Sunagawa Incident"; demand the disclosure of the content of the "Security Treaty" revision negotiations, oppose Nobusuke Kishi going to the United States to sign a new treaty; abolish military spending and use this expenditure for disaster relief and social insurance systems; strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and the conclusion of a Japan-Soviet peace treaty; strive for the abolition of the "Security Treaty" and the establishment of an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan; overthrow the traitorous, reactionary, and war-mongering Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet; all patriotic and democratic forces unite and do everything possible to stop the revision of the "Security Treaty."

    At the same time, the Tokyo Metropolitan Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued an appeal on the 17th, calling on all party members in Tokyo to fully prepare to victoriously hold the Eighth National Unified Action Day on the 27th to stop the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 20th: The 13th National Extraordinary Convention of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan ("Sohyo") successfully concluded in Tokyo today.

    The conference unanimously adopted the current struggle policy on smashing the Japan-U.S. security system and the policy on preparing to launch next year's spring struggle.

    In his concluding remarks, "Sohyo" Secretary-General Akira Iwai pointed out that in future struggles, "Sohyo" will focus on strengthening the movement to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations; strengthening regional joint struggle organizations to stop the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"; and launching struggles to support coal miners' unions throughout the country.

    The struggle policy stipulates that in order to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the largest-scale strength struggle will be carried out on December 10, the Ninth National Unified Action Day. On this day, a general strike will be held.

    In order to support the struggle of coal miners, 3 billion yen in funds will be raised.

    The struggle policy also stipulates that in order to oppose "corporate rationalization," in the spring struggle, "Sohyo" will demand increased wages and shorter working hours.

    The conference unanimously passed a resolution stating that it would fight against the import of all missiles and nuclear weapons into Japan. The resolution stated that the Kishi Nobusuke government's import of "Sidewinder" missiles is the first step for Japan to become nuclear armed. The resolution expressed opposition to the "Self-Defense Forces" building missile bases on Niijima Island and to the U.S. military testing missiles in Okinawa.

    The conference also passed a resolution pointing out that the Kishi Nobusuke government's payment of war reparations to South Vietnam can only use taxes collected from the Japanese people to strengthen military bases in South Vietnam. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent the Diet from ratifying the compensation agreement signed between Japan and South Vietnam.

    The conference passed a resolution stating that "Sohyo" will unite with farmers and urban residents to launch struggles to urge the government to change its arms expansion policy and demand that the government allocate disaster relief funds.

    The conference also passed a resolution on striving to organize unorganized textile workers, as well as a resolution on urging the government to formulate special laws to protect workers' health and treatment.

    The declaration unanimously adopted by the conference stated that "Sohyo" will stand at the forefront and further strengthen the struggle to stop the revision of the "Security Treaty," which is related to the future of the Japanese nation.

    The declaration emphasized that all workers must hold strikes at the same time, so that partial struggles develop into national struggles.

    The declaration called on workers across the country to firmly believe in victory and fight to the end to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, which is eager to revive imperialism with the support of U.S. imperialism, at a time when international tensions are easing and the reactionary rule of Kishi Nobusuke is beginning to waver.

    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本共产党、日本工会总评议会和社会党最近决定，将在27日——第八次全国统一行动日在全国各地联合散发一千万张反对修改日美“安全条约”的招贴传单。
    “赤旗报”今天就这件事发表社论说，按照这个决定，日共已经向都、道、府、县各级地方组织分发了一百万张传单。
    社论强调指出，这是在日本斗争历史上前所未有的壮举，也是符合粉碎美帝国主义和日本反动势力修改“安全条约”的犯罪阴谋的行动。“赤旗报”号召日共全体党组织和党员站在这次联合行动的前列，并且通过这次行动争取发展包括共产党和社会党在内的反对“安全条约”的统一斗争，进一步使统一战线的思想深入广大人民。
    日共散发的传单中的统一口号有：阻止修改“安全条约”，立即停止日美谈判。
    传单中还包括下列七项单独由日本共产党提出的口号：支持全面、彻底裁军建议，要求美军撤出日本，支持关于“砂川事件”的判决；要求公开修改“安全条约”谈判的内容，反对岸信介到美国签署新条约；取消军事开支，把这项费用用于救灾和社会保险制度；争取恢复日中邦交，缔结日苏和约；争取废除“安全条约”，建立独立、民主、和平和中立的日本；打倒卖国、反动和战争的岸信介内阁；一切爱国民主力量团结起来，全力阻止修改“安全条约”。
    同时，日本共产党东京都委员会在17日发表号召书，号召东京的全体党员全力准备在27日胜利举行阻止修改日美“安全条约”第八次全国统一行动。
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会（“总评”）第十三次全国特别大会今天在东京胜利闭幕。
    大会一致通过了关于粉碎日美安全体系的当前斗争方针和关于准备展开明年的春季斗争的方针。
    “总评”事务局长岩井章在总结发言中指出，在今后的斗争中，“总评”将要着重加强展开打开日中关系僵局的运动；加强阻止修改日美“安全条约”的地区性共同斗争组织；在全国各地展开支援煤矿工会的斗争。
    斗争方针规定：为了阻止修改日美“安全条约”，将在12月10日第九次全国统一行动日进行最大规模的实力斗争。在这一天，将举行总罢工。
    为了支援煤矿工人的斗争，将筹集三十亿日元的资金。
    斗争方针还规定，为了反对“企业合理化”，在春季斗争中，“总评”将要求增加工资，缩短劳动时间。
    大会一致通过决议，表示将为反对把一切导弹和核武器运进日本而斗争。决议说，岸信介政府运进“响尾蛇式”导弹是日本走向核武装的第一步。决议表示反对“自卫队”在新岛建设导弹基地和反对美军在冲绳试验导弹。
    大会还通过决议指出，岸信介政府向南越支付战争赔偿只能把从日本人民征收的税金用于加强南越的军事基地。因此，要阻止国会批准日本同南越签订的赔偿协定。
    大会通过决议表示，“总评”将同农民和城市居民团结一致展开斗争，促使政府改变扩军政策，要求由政府拨出救灾费用。
    大会还通过了关于努力把尚未组织起来的纺织工人组织起来的决议，以及关于促使政府制定保护工人健康和治疗的特别法律的决议。
    大会一致通过的宣言表示，“总评”将站在前列，进一步加强展开关系着日本民族前途的阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争。
    宣言强调指出，全体工人必须同时举行罢工，使部分斗争发展为全国性的斗争。
    宣言号召全国工人，在国际紧张局势趋向缓和、岸信介的反动统治地位开始动摆的时候，坚定胜利信心，为打倒在美帝国主义支持下急于复活帝国主义的岸信介内阁而斗争到底。
