Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 14th: The people in the coastal areas of Fujian Province are working intensely to fight drought and rush planting, striving for a bumper harvest of late-season crops.

Since mid-September, parts of the coastal areas of Fujian, including the special districts of Fuan, Minhou, Jinjiang, Longxi, and the city of Xiamen, have experienced prolonged drought. Except for the Fuan and Minhou special districts, which received 50 mm of rainfall in late September, other areas have not had any rain. According to incomplete statistics, the drought-affected area has reached 1.88 million mu, severely impacting the growth of late-season crops and the progress of winter planting. To ensure the timely completion of winter planting tasks and ensure a bumper harvest of late-maturing crops, the people's communes in the drought-affected areas have led the broad masses of commune members to launch a struggle against drought to rush planting and protect the harvest. By November 10th, in the Jinjiang, Longxi, and Minhou special districts, which were heavily affected by drought, nearly one million mu of winter crops had been planted. Most of the late-season crops in the drought-affected coastal areas have been irrigated one to three times.

In the fight against drought, various localities have given full play to the superiority of the people's communes, carried out large-scale cooperation, and ranked drought conditions, water sources, and labor forces, utilizing all water-lifting tools and adjusting their use among each other. The Guanqiao and Chenggong communes in Nan'an County coordinated the arrangement of labor and adjusted the use of tools among each other, mobilizing more than 20,000 people to irrigate the land and rush plant more than 6,000 mu and irrigate nearly 40,000 mu of late autumn crops in just a few days. The Zhidian brigade of the Sucuo commune in Jinjiang County mobilized more than 800 people to set up camps on the mountains and in the fields, using more than 140 waterwheels to draw river water up to the highlands to irrigate the land and rush plant. Huian County mobilized more than 90,000 people every day to carry water and irrigate 50,000 mu of land. Dongshan County adopted five measures, including digging springs, digging sand pits, opening ditches, building dams, and repairing channels, to develop water sources and use various tools to irrigate, with 28,000 people irrigating more than 88,000 mu of land and rushing to plant more than 33,300 mu of winter crops.

In the fight against drought, various localities also combined it with water conservancy construction and channel renovation to ensure water for winter planting. Jinjiang County mobilized nearly 30,000 people to rush repair more than 360 small-scale water conservancy projects and channels, enabling 25,000 mu of drought-affected land to be planted with wheat early. The Feiyue commune in Huian County mobilized more than 700 people every day to renovate more than 200 kilometers of various channels in half a month, enabling the timely completion of sowing on 1,600 mu of land prepared for winter planting on both sides of the channels.

To ensure the vigorous growth of winter crops, various localities have established field management professional teams and responsibility systems to carry out seedling inspection, seedling replanting, pest control, and fertilization. In Fuqing County, more than 50,000 people were involved in the drought resistance and seedling protection movement every day, and more than 70,000 mu of fields basically got rid of the drought in a few days. More than 200,000 mu of wheat planted in the Minhou special district have generally been fertilized with 15 dan of human manure as topdressing.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, November 14th: After overcoming the autumn drought, the broad masses of farmers in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have actively engaged in the battle of drought resistance and winter planting. As of the 8th, the region had sown 8.94 million mu of grain, vegetables, and green manure, accounting for 82.4% of the planned sown area. At present, the struggle against drought is still ongoing.

Since late September, Guangxi has had little rain, and some areas have experienced drought. In October, the rainfall in the northern region was relatively high, while the rainfall in the central and southern regions was less than 30 mm, and the drought-affected area in the region rapidly expanded to 3.5 million mu. This seriously threatened late rice, late corn, and autumn sweet potatoes; dryland crops were also affected by varying degrees of drought. In early November, except for the Guibei and Guizhong regions, which received 28 to 51 mm of rain, the Guinan region (including the southern part of the Baise region) basically had no rain. The drought situation continues to develop.

As soon as the drought signs appeared in various parts of Guangxi, 2 million commune members of all ethnic groups in the drought-affected areas plunged into the fight against drought. After nearly a month of fighting, the drought situation in rice has been basically controlled, and some dryland crops have also been watered once. Now the late rice is ripening one after another, and the early-maturing rice has begun to be harvested.

At present, commune members of all ethnic groups in the drought-affected areas are rushing to plant while fighting the drought. The 33 Party committee secretaries and 413 brigade cadres of the 20 people's communes in Tiandeng County led the commune members of all ethnic groups day and night to fight drought and rush planting. The Nawei brigade of the Dukang commune in the county transferred more than 300 people, divided into two shifts, one shift camped in the fields to draw water and irrigate the land, and the other shift carried out rushing to plow, crush the soil, prepare the land, and sow. After three days of hard work, they completed the task of rushing to plant 230 mu of wheat. When the members of the Weipai production team of the Luoman commune in Liujiang County were plowing the land, they could not plow it with a soil plow because of the prolonged drought, so they switched to using a new-style walking plow. Some places could not be plowed, so they used hoes to dig. They plowed the land, prepared the land, and ridged during the day, and watered and sowed at night. After three days of hard work, they finally completed the winter sowing task. In the drought resistance and rush planting in Pingguo County, more than 200 soil crushing machines were promoted, which increased the efficiency of winter planting by eight times. The Guilin Special District successfully completed the sowing task of more than 2 million mu of winter crops on November 8, exceeding the quota by 5.5%.

    充分发挥公社优越性开展大协作
    福建广西抗旱抢种
    新华社福州14日电　福建省沿海地区人民，正在紧张进行抗旱抢种，力争晚收作物丰产。
    从9月中旬到现在，福建沿海的福安、闽侯、晋江、龙溪等专区的部分地区和厦门市久旱不雨。除福安、闽侯两专区在9月下旬降雨五十毫米外，其他地方均未降雨。据不完全统计，受旱面积达一百八十八万亩，严重地影响着晚收作物生长和冬播工作的进行。为了保证及时完成冬播任务，和确保晚熟作物丰产，受旱地区的人民公社领导广大社员展开了抗旱抢种和保丰收斗争。到11月10日止，受旱较重的晋江、龙溪和闽侯等专区抗旱抢种的越冬作物近百万亩，沿海受旱的晚收作物，大部分浇灌了一次到三次水。
    各地在抗旱中充分发挥人民公社的优越性，开展大协作，对旱情、水源、劳力等进行排队，利用一切提水工具，互相调剂使用。南安县官桥和成功两个公社协同安排劳力，互相调剂使用工具，共出动二万多人，在几天中就浇地抢种六千多亩，灌溉晚秋作物近四万亩。晋江县苏厝公社汁店大队出动八百多人上山下田安营扎寨，使用一百四十多架水车把河水引上高坡浇地抢种。惠安县每天出动九万多人，挑水浇地五万亩。东山县采取以打泉眼、挖沙坑、开水沟、筑水坝、修渠道等五项办法开发水源，利用各种工具浇水，二万八千多人浇地八万八千多亩，并抢种越冬作物三万三千三百多亩。
    各地在抗旱中还结合开展兴修水利和整修渠道，保证冬种用水。晋江县出动近三万人抢修小型水利和渠道三百六十多处，使二万五千亩受旱土地提早种上小麦。惠安飞跃公社每天出动七百多人，半个月整修各种渠道达二百多公里，使渠道两旁一千六百亩备冬种田适时完成了播种。
    为了保证冬种作物茁壮的生长，各地建立了田间管理专业队和责任制，开展查苗、补苗、除虫和施肥工作。福清县每天有五万多人投入抗旱保苗运动，几天中有七万多亩田基本解除旱象。闽侯专区抗旱抢种的二十万多亩小麦已普遍施了十五担人粪追肥。
    新华社南宁14日电　广西僮族自治区的广大农民，在战胜秋旱之后，又积极投入抗旱冬种的战斗。到8日止，全区已播种粮食、蔬菜、绿肥八百九十四万亩，占计划播种面积82.4％。目前，抗旱斗争还在继续进行。
    从9月下旬开始，广西就少雨，部分地区出现旱象。10月份，北部地区降雨量较多，中部、南部地区降雨不足三十毫米，全区受旱面积迅速发展到三百五十万亩。严重威胁着晚稻、晚玉米和秋红薯等；旱地作物也受到不同程度的干旱。11月上旬，除桂北、桂中地区降了二十八毫米到五十一毫米的雨外，桂南地区（包括百色地区南部）基本没有降雨。旱情仍在继续发展。
    广西各地旱象刚一露头，受旱地区的二百万各族社员，便投入抗旱斗争。经过将近一个月的战斗，水稻旱象基本制止，部分的旱地作物也浇了一次水。现在晚稻相继黄熟，早熟的已开始收割。
    目前，受旱地区的各族社员，正在抗旱抢种。天等县二十个人民公社的三十三位党委书记和四百一十三个大队的干部，带领着各族社员夜以继日地抗旱抢种。这个县的都康公社那微大队，抽调三百多人，分两班人马，一班在田头安营扎寨，提水浇地，一班进行抢犁、碎土，整地播种，经过三天奋战，完成了二百三十亩小麦抢种任务。柳江县洛满公社维排生产队的社员耕地时，因旱得太久，用土犁犁不动，就改用新式步犁，有些地犁不动，就用锄头来挖。白天犁地、整地、起畦，晚上浇水播种，苦干了三天，终于完成了冬播任务。平果县在抗旱抢种中，推广了二百多架碎土机，使冬种工效提高八倍。桂林专区在11月8日已超额5.5％，胜利地完成了二百多万亩越冬作物的播种任务。
