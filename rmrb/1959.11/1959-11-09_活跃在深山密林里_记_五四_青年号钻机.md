Active in the Deep Mountains and Forests
    ——A Record of the "May Fourth" Youth Drill

    Starting from Chen County Special District, Hunan, along the Yilin Highway, you enter a continuous mountainous area. At a glance, the mountains resemble saw teeth, covered with various lush vegetation and ancient pines and firs, verdant and dark green. … This is the Denglimen Mountain range in Meitian, Linyi County. Wang Guoji, the captain of the nationally renowned 425 Geological Exploration Team's "May Fourth" Youth Drill, and his partners are fighting here.
    Wang Guoji is a modest, prudent, hardworking, brave, lively, and robust young exploration team member. In recent years, under the education and cultivation of the Party, he has made considerable achievements for the socialist construction cause of the motherland.

    Cemented Carbide Drill Bit – Resurrected
    Geological drilling used to rely on cemented carbide drill bits. However, after January 1955, Wang Guoji's original 404 Geological Drilling Team promoted the experience of iron sand drilling, and cemented carbide drill bits were rarely used. Iron sand drilling has its advantages in harder rock formations, but it is not very efficient in softer rock formations, advancing only two or three meters per shift.
    At that time, Wang Guoji was the deputy captain of Drill No. 36. He often pondered over the problem of low efficiency after the promotion of iron sand drilling. One night, he suddenly saw in "Mining Engineering" that the Soviet Union had very high drilling efficiency and used cemented carbide drill bits. He read it over and over again as if he had found a treasure, wondering why the Soviet Union's cemented carbide drill bits were so efficient. After careful observation, he realized that the cemented carbide tips used by the Soviets were octagonal prismatic, with ground corners and sharp bottom edges; we use rectangular flat edges. If we grind the corners, wouldn't it also improve efficiency? So, he decided to conduct a corner grinding test. He was extremely happy and quickly told the captain about it. But the captain disagreed with the experiment.
    Soon, the leadership called on everyone to propose innovation suggestions. Wang Guoji told his plan to several partners, and they all encouraged him to try it out.
    Late at night, the workers in the repair shop had gone to bed. Wang Guoji and a few others quietly opened the window, jumped in, turned on the lights, and started grinding the drill bit. After the drill bit was ground, Wang Guoji took it to the drill the next day for a test and achieved eight meters in one shift. "Success!" Everyone jumped up and down with joy. Then they worked for two more shifts, advancing a total of twenty-four meters, more than doubling the efficiency compared to iron sand drilling. In this way, within three days, corner-ground cemented carbide drill bits were promoted throughout the team.
    Later, Wang Guoji and his comrades continued to experiment and solved the problem of cemented carbide tips breaking off when using cemented carbide drill bits. Thus, the experience of cemented carbide drill bits was quickly spread to fraternal teams across the country, and soon it was promoted nationwide.

    "Terrible Number" Becomes Advanced Number
    The 404 Geological Team had a Drill No. 39, which was often unable to complete its production tasks due to the lack of supervision by the original leadership, earning it the nickname "Terrible Number."
    One day in June 1955, Wang Guoji suddenly received a notice from the team headquarters, transferring him to Drill No. 39 as captain. After Wang Guoji came to Drill No. 39, he first understood the situation of the drill and learned that the previous captain provided little specific help to the comrades, so he took the lead in everything and used practical actions to motivate everyone.
    One day, seeing that the installation work was in danger of being delayed, Wang Guoji personally led several temporary workers up the mountain to install it. In the afternoon, a torrential rain suddenly began, making it difficult for everyone to open their eyes. Wang Guoji told everyone to rest, but he braved the heavy rain to level the foundation himself. Under his leadership, everyone lit kerosene lamps and fought at night, and the drill was installed that day.
    In the past, the drilling quality was not high, and the borehole deviation was large. After Wang Guoji came, every time a borehole was started, he discussed with everyone how to prevent borehole deviation. He led everyone to study the working methods of Drill No. 38, "simplifying borehole construction," and introduced his own experience to everyone. The problem of borehole deviation was solved, and the efficiency was also improved.
    Peng Xingyan and Zhao Hailin on the drill both liked to study technology. In the past, Peng Xingyan had suggested increasing the speed, and Zhao Hailin had suggested increasing the pressure, but the drill captain at the time did not support them. After Wang Guoji came, he encouraged them to experiment, and the result was improved efficiency. In this way, in the first month after he arrived, he fought a beautiful battle, advancing more than 400 meters and exceeding the state plan.
    Later, Wang Guoji strengthened the unity of the comrades in the group, everyone worked with peace of mind, and everyone was full of energy, so production gradually increased. By November, the footage reached 765 meters, creating the highest national record for core drilling. In this month, Drill No. 39 was rated as an advanced drill in the country. Wang Guoji was also elected as a representative to attend the National Congress of Active Builders of Socialist Youth.

    Unforgettable Meeting
    One day in January 1956, Wang Guoji was working hard on the drill when a telegram suddenly arrived from the team headquarters. Looking at it, it was from the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), informing him that he had been elected as a member of the CPPCC. The telegram asked him to go to Beijing for a meeting.
    When he arrived in Beijing, at more than nine o'clock the next morning, the members gathered in the solemn CPPCC Auditorium. Suddenly, thunderous applause rang out throughout the venue. It turned out that Chairman Mao and other leaders had arrived. Wang Guoji carefully scrutinized Chairman Mao. A kind smile always appeared on that kind face, and he waved to everyone from time to time. Everyone had quieted down, but Wang Guoji still stared intently at the kind Chairman Mao. A sense of happiness surrounded his heart, and he couldn't help but shed tears of emotion. At this moment, he recalled his past. Wang Guoji grew up in a poor family. His father died when he was five years old, and he was raised by a distant aunt. He started as an apprentice at the age of fourteen. In that man-eating old society, the life of an apprentice was more bitter than Coptis chinensis. After liberation, he joined the geological exploration work. In recent years, under the cultivation of the Party, he joined the Communist Youth League, and then joined the Party. He made some achievements in production and was valued by the Party and the state. Now he has been elected as a member of the CPPCC, representing the worker brothers to come to Beijing to discuss national affairs with the great leader Chairman Mao. At the thought of this, he gained an infinite strength. At that time, he secretly resolved: "Respected Chairman Mao, the Party has liberated us poor people and made us the masters of the country. Now I want to give my whole heart to the Party, strive to be a glorious drilling worker, and contribute my life to the geological exploration cause of the motherland. I will overcome all difficulties and resolutely achieve a thousand meters of drilling this year."

    Before and After the Realization of Thousand-Meter Drilling
    After returning from the meeting in Beijing, Wang Guoji thought about it all day long: When will we be able to achieve thousand-meter drilling?
    On the last day of February, Wang Guoji and his comrades studied the plan for how to achieve thousand-meter drilling in March. Everyone was very motivated, and the plan was approved. However, the first ten days of March passed, and the plan was not completed well. After the Party committee secretary found out, he encouraged Wang Guoji on the one hand, and decided to strengthen the ideological mobilization of the workers on the other hand. He held a meeting of Party members, League members, and key personnel to mobilize them, and held a swearing-in meeting of all employees to further inspire the fighting spirit of the workers.
    Since then, an even more intense battle has unfolded, and the workers are full of energy. Although production has improved, only half of the task had been completed by March 20. There are only ten days left until the end of the month, what should we do?
    At midnight, Wang Guoji was lying in bed, thinking that the production task had not been completed, and he couldn't fall asleep. He tiptoed out of the room, walked around with his hands behind his back and his head lowered, thinking about how to break through the current difficulty of not being able to complete the production task. Suddenly, he remembered that he had gone to the repair shop the day before yesterday and saw the scene of the lathe spinning quickly. The faster the lathe speed, the faster and more the iron filings were cut. Thinking of this, he was suddenly inspired: If the drilling rig increases the pressure and speeds up the rotation, wouldn't the drill bit drill faster? Some time ago, Peng Xingyan and Zhao Hailin increased the pressure a little and accelerated the rotation speed, and the effect was very good. Thinking of this, he immediately woke up Xiao Peng and Xiao Zhao and told them his thoughts, and they agreed very much. After obtaining the support of the Party committee secretary, they immediately started working. In one test, the drilling footage was indeed much faster. In this way, at the end of the month, the calculation showed that a total of 1,092 meters had been drilled.
    The plan for thousand-meter drilling has been realized, and all the employees of the team cheered for this victory. When the news reached the Soviet Union, Mishenko, the captain of the No. 4 drill of the Katyaer Geological Exploration Team of the Soviet Advanced Red Banner Drill, the Kazakh Geological Bureau, also wrote a letter to Wang Guoji to congratulate them on their victory.
    Since then, Drill No. 39 was named the "May Fourth" Youth Drill.

    Marching Towards Ten Thousand Meters!
    Since Wang Guoji participated in drilling work in 1951, in Guangxi, in Hunan... in the vast deep mountains and dense forests of the motherland, due to the education of the Party, leading the masses to work hard and drill diligently, he has successfully completed the state's exploration tasks. In less than thirty-three months, he completed the work tasks of one hundred months and six days, and began to do the work of 1964 in 1958. As of June this year, they have reached a record of more than 26,000 meters of drilling. This year, they have also put forward the slogan "Marching Towards Ten Thousand Meters!" and are now fighting tensely to achieve this goal.

    活跃在深山密林里
    ——记“五四”青年号钻机
    从湖南郴县专区沿着宜临公路前行，进入了一片连绵的山峦地区。一眼望去，山峰好像锯齿，山上长满了各种各样繁茂的草木和古老的松、杉，葱茏青黑。……这就是临宜县梅田登里门山群。全国闻名的四二五地质勘探队“五四”青年号机机长王国骥和他的伙伴们，就战斗在这里。
    王国骥是一个谦虚谨慎、勤劳勇敢、活泼健壮的青年勘探队员。近几年来，在党的教育培养下，他为祖国社会主义建设事业做出了不小的成绩。
    合金钻头  起死回生
    地质钻探，过去用的都是合金钻头。但是，在1955年1月以后，王国骥原在的四零四地质钻探队，推广了铁砂钻进的经验，合金钻头就很少有人用它了。铁砂钻进在较硬的岩层是有它的优越性的，但是在较软的岩层则效率不高，一班只能钻进两、三米。
    王国骥那时在三十六号钻机当副机长。他对铁砂钻进推广后效率不高的问题，经常日思夜想。一天晚上，他突然在“探矿工程学”上看到苏联的钻探工效很高，而且用的是合金钻头。他如获至宝地看了一遍又一遍，琢磨着苏联用合金钻头工效那么高的原因在哪里。经过细心观察，原来苏联用的合金片是八角柱状?磨角的，底刃锋利；我们用的是长方式平刃的，如果也把它磨角，不就也能提高工效了吗？于是他决定进行磨角试验。他高兴得了不得，连忙把这事告诉了机长。谁知道机长一听，却不同意进行试验。
    不久，领导号召大家提革新建议，王国骥把他的打算告诉了几个伙伴，大家都鼓励他试验一下。
    夜深了，修配厂的工人睡觉去了，王国骥同几个人悄悄地打开窗门，跳进去打开电灯，磨起钻头来。钻头磨好以后，第二天，王国骥拿到钻机上去试验，居然一个班打了八米。“成功了！”大家高兴得蹦跳起来。接着又干了两个班，共进尺二十四米，比铁砂钻进提高工效两倍多。就这样，没到三天时间，磨角合金钻头在全队都推广起来。
    以后，王国骥又和同志们继续试验，解决了使用合金钻头时碰掉合金片的问题。这样，合金钻头的经验很快就传到全国各兄弟队，不久全国都推广了。
    “糟糕号”成了先进号
    四零四地质队有一台三十九号钻机，由于原来的领导上抓得不紧，生产任务经常完不成，落了个“糟糕号”的绰号。
    1955年6月的一天，王国骥突然接到队部的通知，调他去三十九号当机长。王国骥来到三十九号钻机以后，首先摸清了钻机的情况，了解到前机长对同志们具体帮助少，于是他就事事自己带头干，用实际行动来带动大家。
    一天，眼看安装工作有窝工危险，王国骥就亲自带领几个临时工上山去安装。下午突然下起暴雨来，淋得大家睁不开眼睛，王国骥就叫大家去休息，自己却冒着大雨去平地基；在他的带动下，晚上大家点起马灯夜战，当天就把钻机安装好了。
    过去钻进质量不高，孔斜度大，王国骥来了以后，每当开孔的时候，就同大家研究如何预防孔斜的问题。他带领大家学习了三十八号机“简化钻孔构造”的工作方法，还把自己的经验介绍给大家，孔斜问题解决了，工效也提高了。
    钻机上的彭兴炎和赵海林，都喜欢钻研技术。过去彭兴炎曾建议过加快转速，赵海林建议过加大压力，当时钻机长没有支持他们。王国骥来了以后，就鼓励他们进行试验，结果提高了工效。就这样，他来后第一个月就打了一个漂亮仗，进尺四百多米，超额完成了国家计划。
    以后，王国骥又加强了组里同志们的团结，大家工作也安心了，个个干劲十足，因而生产逐渐上升，到11月，进尺达到七百六十五米，创造了全国岩心钻探最高纪录。就在这一个月，三十九号钻机被评为全国的先进钻机。王国骥也当选为出席全国的青年社会主义建设积极分子代表大会的代表。
    难忘的会见
    1956年1月的一天，王国骥正在钻机上干得起劲，忽然队部通讯员送来一份电报。一看，是全国政协来的，他当选为全国政协的委员。电报要他到北京去开会。
    到了北京，第二天上午九点多，委员们都聚集在庄严的政协礼堂，突然全场响起了春雷般的掌声，原来是毛主席和其他的领袖们来了。王国骥仔细地端详着毛主席，那慈祥的脸上一直浮现着愉快的笑容，不时向大家招手。大家已经静下来了，但是，王国骥仍然目不转睛地望着慈祥的毛主席，一种幸福感萦绕在他的心头，他不禁感动得流出了眼泪。就在这时候，他回忆起自己的过去。王国骥生长在一个贫苦的家庭里，五岁就死了父亲，全靠一个旁亲伯母把他抚养长大。十四岁开始当学徒。在那吃人的旧社会，学徒的生活比黄连还苦。解放以后，他参加了地质勘探工作。几年来，在党的培养下，他入了团，又入了党，在生产上作出了一点成绩，就得到了党和国家的珍视。现在又被选为政协委员，代表着工人兄弟们来到北京，和伟大的领袖毛主席一起商讨国家大事。一想起这些，他全身就增加了一股无穷的力量。当时他暗自下决心说：“敬爱的毛主席，党解放了我们这些穷苦人，当了国家的主人，现在我要把自己的心全部交给党，争取作一个光荣的钻探工人，为祖国的地质勘探事业贡献出自己毕生的力量。我要克服一切困难，坚决要在今年实现千米钻进。”
    千米钻进实现前后
    从北京开会回去以后，王国骥成天地想着：什么时候才能够实现千米钻进呢？
    2月的最后一天，王国骥和同志们研究着3月份怎样实现千米钻进的计划。大家干劲都很高，计划被通过了。但是，3月上旬过去了，计划完成得并不好。党委书记知道以后，一方面对王国骥进行鼓励，同时决定加强职工的思想发动工作，召开了党团员骨干会议，进行动员，并召开了全体职工誓师大会，来进一步鼓舞职工们的斗志。
    从此，一场更紧张的战斗展开了，工人们浑身是劲。生产虽然有了起色，但是到了3月20日，任务也只才完成了一半。离月底只有十天了，怎么办呢？
    午夜了，王国骥躺在床上，想到生产任务还完不成，怎么也睡不着。他轻手轻脚地溜出房外，背着手、低着头，不住地走来走去，思考着怎样突破眼前完不成生产任务的难关。忽然，他想起了前天去修配厂，看见车床飞快转动的情景，车床转速越快，切削铁屑也越快越多。想到这里，顿时启发了他：钻机如果再加大压力、加快转速，那么钻头的钻进不是也快了么？前些时候，彭兴炎和赵海林加大了点压力和加快了转速，效果很好。想到这里，他立刻叫醒了小彭和小赵，把自己的想法告诉他们，他们也很同意。在得到党委书记的支持以后，他们就立刻干起来。一试验，果然进尺快多了。就这样，到月底一计算，共钻进了一千零九十二米。
    千米钻进的计划实现了，全队职工都为这个胜利而欢呼。这个消息传到了苏联，苏维埃先进红旗钻机哈萨克地质局卡佳尔地质勘探队四号机机长米申柯，也写信给王国骥，祝贺他们的胜利。
    从此，三十九号钻机被命名为“五四”青年号钻机。
    向万米进军！
    王国骥从1951年参加钻探工作以来，在广西、在湖南……在祖国漫漫无际的深山密林里，由于在党的教育下，带领群众苦干苦钻，出色地完成了国家的勘探任务，不到三十三个月的时间，完成了一百个月零六天的工作任务，1958年就开始做1964年的工作了。到今年6月为止，他们已经达到钻进二万六千多米的纪录。今年，他们又提出了“向万米进军！”的口号，现在正为实现这个目标而紧张地战斗着。
