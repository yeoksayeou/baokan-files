Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 17th: Inspired by the advanced experience of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company in "steelmaking in converter furnaces without baking," cupola furnace workers at the Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6 boldly innovated and adopted the method of not baking new furnaces in the cupola furnaces. This method was successfully tested for the first time on the 13th.

In the past, the entire process of a newly built cupola furnace, from ignition and baking to the production of molten iron, took as long as seven and a half hours. After adopting the method of not baking the furnace, it was shortened to one hour and forty-five minutes. The melting rate of pig iron and the temperature of the molten iron were exactly the same as when baking the furnace before. This has created new favorable conditions for the converter workshop to organize rapid steelmaking.

After Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6 tested the advanced method of "steelmaking in converter furnaces without baking," the cupola furnace workers who provide iron to the converter furnace immediately realized that if the cupola furnace did not take corresponding measures to keep up closely, the iron supply would be disconnected, which would hold back the converter furnace and prevent steel production from rapidly increasing. A high sense of responsibility prompted the cupola furnace workers to immediately consider whether the newly built cupola furnace could also adopt the method of not baking the furnace. They decided to test it on No. 3 cupola furnace first. After repeated research, they believed that the key to melting iron without baking the furnace was to prevent the bottom of the rear furnace from cracking and penetrating. As long as the bottom of the rear furnace does not crack, and the first furnace of molten iron can be successfully melted, the problem would be solved. So everyone concentrated their efforts on tackling the problem of preventing the bottom of the rear furnace from cracking. With many people, enthusiasm was high, and there were many ideas. After discussion, it was decided to build a layer of refractory bricks on the bottom of the rear furnace. After preparation, the workers of Group B began the experiment on the evening of the 13th, personally supervised by foreman Liang Xinghe. They immediately blew air as soon as they ignited the furnace, saving five and a half hours of baking time. As soon as the bottom coke was burning vigorously, they immediately added materials. After another forty-five minutes, the first furnace of molten iron flowed out. The melting speed and molten iron temperature were exactly the same as those after baking the furnace. After the first shot was fired, the second and third furnaces... all smoothly flowed out molten iron. By twelve o'clock on the evening of the 14th, this cupola furnace had melted a total of forty-five furnaces of molten iron, averaging about eleven tons of molten iron per hour.

### “转炉不烘炉炼钢”的种子在化铁炉上开花  上钢化铁炉不烘炉熔铁成功

    “转炉不烘炉炼钢”的种子在化铁炉上开花
    上钢化铁炉不烘炉熔铁成功
    据新华社上海17日电　上钢六厂化铁炉工人在太原钢铁公司“转炉不烘炉炼钢”先进经验的启发下，大胆革新，在化铁炉上也采用了新砌炉子不烘炉的办法。这个办法在13日第一次试验便获得成功。
    过去，新砌的化铁炉从点火烘炉到出铁水，全部过程长达七个半小时，采用不烘炉的办法后，一下子缩短到一小时四十五分；生铁的熔化率和铁水温度都跟以前烘炉时完全一样。这就为转炉车间组织快速炼钢创造了新的有利条件。
    上钢六厂试验“转炉不烘炉炼钢”的先进方法以后，为转炉提供铁水的化铁炉工人立即想到，如果化铁炉不采取相应措施紧紧跟上，铁水供应脱节，就会拖住转炉的“后腿”，使钢产量不能很快地跃上去。高度的责任感促使着化铁炉工人马上考虑新砌的化铁炉能不能也采取不烘炉的办法。他们决定首先在三号化铁炉上试验。经过反复研究，认为要做到不烘炉熔铁，关键在于防止后炉炉底爆裂穿底。只要后炉炉底不爆裂，第一炉铁水能够顺利熔化，问题就解决了。于是大家集中力量猛攻防止后炉炉底爆裂这一关。人多热气高、干劲足，办法也多，经过讨论，决定在后炉炉底砌上一层耐火砖。准备妥当以后，13日晚上，乙班工人开始试验，由工长梁星和亲自掌握，一点火马上鼓风，省去了五个半小时的烘炉时间；等到底焦一烧旺，马上加料；再过四十五分钟，第一炉铁水就流出来了，熔化速度、铁水温度与烘过炉的完全一样。第一炮打响，第二炉、第三炉……也都顺利地流出了铁水。到14日晚上十二时止，这只化铁炉一共熔了四十五炉铁水，平均一小时出铁水十一吨左右。
