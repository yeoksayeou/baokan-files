Liling County's Late Rice Crop Surpasses the Early Rice Crop
    Overcoming Severe Drought and Insect Pests, Per-Unit Yield Increases by 40% Compared to Early Rice

    (By Our Newspaper) Hunan's Liling County's total production and per-unit area yield of double-cropped late rice this year have exceeded those of the early rice. The county's 410,000+ mu of double-cropped late rice averaged 724 jin per mu, an increase of 44.2% compared to early rice. The entire county has one 1,000-jin commune for double-cropped late rice, forty-three 1,000-jin brigades, five hundred and ten 1,000-jin production teams, and 80,597 mu of 1,000-jin mu plots. This is an unprecedented bumper harvest!
    During this period, gongs and drums resounded everywhere in Liling's rural areas, celebrating the harvest. Many production teams received excess grain, and people are calculating how to live frugally. On the highways and rural roads, smiling commune members are pushing carts, selling surplus grain to the state. The county has now overfulfilled its grain procurement tasks.
    This year's exceptionally large late rice harvest in Liling County is the result of holding high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and vigorously launching mass movements; it is the result of thoroughly overcoming drought and insect plagues. This summer, Wangxian and Nanqiao communes proposed a competition throughout the county to make double-cropped late rice surpass early rice, and the competition between communes, teams, and individuals quickly spread. After the Party Central Committee issued instructions against right-leaning tendencies and to encourage enthusiasm, the entire rural area was stirred up, and the production enthusiasm of the masses was further stimulated. The county selected one model commune, forty-four model brigades, four thousand model cadres, and over forty thousand "Five-Good" commune members. In resisting the most severe drought in over sixty years, 180,000 people across the county participated in the anti-drought struggle, with over 19,000 waterwheels and over 140 water pumps running day and night. During the growth period of late rice, Liling County also encountered insect pests rarely seen in over twenty years. The county launched seven large-scale insect extermination campaigns, mobilizing up to 200,000 people at the most, using methods such as manual capture, pesticide application, and fire attacks, finally eliminating the insect pests.
    The fact that Liling County had an exceptionally large late rice harvest once again proves that the potential of people, the potential of the land, and the potential of technology are enormous. Liling County has historically had relatively high grain yields, and some cadres and masses once believed that Liling County's grain yield "could no longer be increased." However, the facts overturned this claim. As early as last winter, when the county party committee was summarizing last year's agricultural Great Leap Forward, it severely criticized "the theory of conditions," "the theory of low late rice yields," and "the theory of reaching the peak of production." The county party committee pointed out that in the past, people did not pay enough attention to late rice production, and the cultivation was rough, especially with late transplanting seasons, often encountering cold snaps in late September or early October during the heading and flowering stage, resulting in low yields. Based on this situation, it was decided to advance the transplanting of late rice and practice intensive cultivation. Under the leadership of the county party committee, mass movements were vigorously launched, and people finally succeeded, with late rice yields surpassing early rice.
    The fact that double-cropped late rice had a bumper harvest led people to raise the question: Since late rice, which historically had lower yields than early rice, can surpass early rice, why can't next year's early rice surpass this year's late rice? With this great goal in mind, Liling County's winter water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movements are becoming even more lively and solid.

### 醴陵县晚稻赛过了早稻  战胜大旱灾大虫害单产比早稻增产四成

    醴陵县晚稻赛过了早稻
    战胜大旱灾大虫害单产比早稻增产四成
    本报讯　湖南醴陵县今年双季晚稻的总产量和单位面积产量，都超过了早稻。全县四十一万多亩双季晚稻，平均亩产七百二十四斤，比早稻增加44.2％。全县有一个双季晚稻千斤社，四十三个千斤大队，五百一十个千斤生产队，八万零五百九十七亩千斤亩。这是空前丰收！
    这期间，醴陵农村到处敲锣打鼓，喜庆丰收。不少生产队分到了超产粮，人们正在计算如何勤俭过日子。在公路上、乡间大道上，满脸笑容的社员，推着车，把余粮卖给国家。现在全县粮食征购任务已经超额完成。
    今年醴陵县晚稻特大丰收，是高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社红旗，大搞群众运动的结果；是彻底战胜旱灾和虫灾的结果。今年夏天，王仙、南桥两个公社向全县提出开展双季晚稻赛早稻的竞赛运动，社与社、队与队、人与人之间的竞赛迅速铺开。党中央反右倾、鼓干劲的指示下达以后，整个农村沸腾起来了，群众的生产积极性得到更大的发挥。全县共评选出一个模范公社、四十四个模范大队、四千多个模范干部和四万多“五好”社员。在抗击六十多年来未遇的大旱中，全县有十八万人投入了抗旱斗争，一万九千多架水车，一百四十多台抽水机，日夜不停。醴陵县在晚稻生长期间还遇到了二十多年来少见的虫害，全县先后开展了七次灭虫大围剿，最多时出动二十万人，采用人工捕打、药杀、火攻等办法，终于消灭了虫害。
    醴陵县晚稻特大丰收的事实，再一次证明了人的潜力、土地的潜力、技术的潜力是巨大的。醴陵县的粮食产量历来是比较高的，曾经有一部分干部和群众认为：醴陵县的粮食产量是“再也上不去了。”但是，事实推翻了这种说法。早在去年冬天，县委在总结去年农业大跃进时，就狠狠地批判了“唯条件论”、“晚稻低产论”和“生产到顶论”。县委指出：历年来由于人们不重视晚稻生产，耕作粗放，特别是插秧季节迟，往往在吐穗扬花时，碰上每年9月底或10月初的寒潮，因此产量不高。根据这种情况，决定提前栽插晚稻，精耕细作。在县委的领导下，大搞群众运动，人们终于胜利了，晚稻产量超过了早稻。
    双季晚稻丰收的事实，使人们提出了这样的问题：既然历年产量比早稻低的晚稻能够赛过早稻，为什么不能使明年的早稻赛过今年的晚稻呢？怀着这个伟大的目的，醴陵县的冬修水利和积肥运动搞得更加热闹，更加扎实。
