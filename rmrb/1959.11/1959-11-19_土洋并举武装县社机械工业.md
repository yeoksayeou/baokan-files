Sichuan Adopts Measures to Promote Tool Reform and Accelerate the Realization of Agricultural Semi-Mechanization
Arming County and Commune Mechanical Industries with Native and Foreign Methods
Many county, district, and commune farm tool factories now have five machine tools, and many production teams have five basic tools.
The province has basically achieved rice threshing with threshing machines, sweet potato processing with semi-mechanized tools; more than sixty counties have achieved vehicle transportation.
Chengdu, November 18th (Report from this newspaper) Sichuan Province, closely integrating tool reform in rural areas, has launched the "Three-Five" movement in local mechanical industries. In the past year, many county, district, and people's commune farm tool factories and production teams have been equipped with machine tools and basic tools such as vises, hacksaws, etc., providing favorable conditions for agriculture to advance towards mechanization.

The "Three-Five" movement is a major measure proposed by the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee in September of last year to accelerate agricultural semi-mechanization. The so-called "Three-Five" movement requires that each county, district, and some people's commune farm tool factories in the province have five machine tools, and each people's commune and some production teams have five basic tools such as tap and die sets, vises, hacksaws, steel files, and bench drills; and widely utilize five types of power resources: water, fire, livestock, wind, and gas (natural gas, biogas, etc.). In the past year, the "Three-Five" movement has developed rapidly. According to incomplete statistics, various localities have manufactured more than 14,000 machine tools such as lathes, planers, and drilling machines, and more than 140,000 pieces of the five types of tools. Many special districts such as Neijiang, Jiangjin, Wenjiang, Luzhou, Nanchong, and Chongqing have generally equipped their farm tool stations and repair stations with "five machines and five tools" or "three machines and five tools."

In the past, the equipment of mechanical factories and farm tool factories below the county level in Sichuan was very simple, and there were few lathes. In order to accelerate the arming of local mechanical industries, Party committees at all levels in the province adhered to the principle of combining native and foreign methods, progressing from native to foreign, criticized the idea of solely relying on support from large industries and the fear of difficulties among some people, mobilized the masses to rely on their own efforts, and vigorously built native machine tools and simple machine tools. Special districts such as Neijiang and Wenjiang had their secretaries take the lead, making arrangements at all levels, carrying out large-scale collaboration, and initially achieving the requirements of the "Three-Five" movement in just over a month. Daba County concentrated all the blacksmiths and carpenters in the county during the movement, using local iron and steel to make machine tools, learning while making, and when materials were insufficient, they mobilized the masses to sell iron and materials, vigorously using substitutes, and rush-produced more than eighty machine tools and one hundred and seventy tools in ten days, enabling all farm tool factories in the county to have five machine tools.

The development of the "Three-Five" movement has provided many people's communes with mechanical manufacturing equipment of considerable scale and cultivated a large number of technical workers. Lezhi County, which pioneered the "Three-Five" movement in the province, manufactured 121 machine tools and more than 5,000 tools at the beginning of this year. On this basis, after continuous addition and repair, it has now increased to more than 380 machine tools, most of which have been transformed from wooden or iron-wood structure machine tools into all-iron semi-native and semi-foreign or preliminary foreign machine tools. The precision has also been greatly improved; the quality of the newly made five types of tools has basically caught up with "foreign" products. Previously, this county only had more than twenty technicians. After the "Three-Five" movement, the county now has more than 1,700 technicians in turning, fitting, planing, and casting.

The "Three-Five" movement has promoted the rapid advancement of tool reform in rural Sichuan towards semi-mechanization. With the establishment of a large number of new farm tool factories and repair stations, the province has initially formed a farm tool manufacturing and repair network, ensuring that general farm tools are repaired on a small scale within the commune and on a large scale within the factory, and manufactured within the county. Many types of new agricultural tools, such as walking plows, seeders, cotton gins, threshing machines, and carts, which previously relied solely on production in a few cities, can now be manufactured by farm tool factories in many townships. This year, rice threshing has basically been achieved using threshing machines, sweet potato processing using various semi-mechanized tools, and transportation in more than sixty counties has been transformed from carrying by shoulders and backs to using carts with ball bearings. Yongxing People's Commune in Mianyang County manufactured more than 160 wheat harvesters, more than 230 wheat threshing machines, and more than 8,000 carts during this year's wheat harvest, thus realizing the semi-mechanization of wheat harvesting, threshing, and transportation, saving more than 50,000 workdays in harvesting alone.

The "Three-Five" movement has created better conditions for the development of commune-run industries and the use of agricultural machinery in various localities. Since the beginning of this year, counties in the Neijiang Special District have manufactured concentrators and pulverizers for local fertilizer plants, slicers, noodle presses, cotton gins for agricultural product processing factories, as well as many machine equipment such as ventilators, motors, and water pumps. Lezhi County alone manufactured eleven motors. Some places have also successfully manufactured small generators. Because many places can generally repair and equip general agricultural machinery, water pumps, generators, and even some parts of tractors after the "Three-Five" movement, it has also promoted the large-scale purchase of agricultural machinery in some areas that were previously inconvenient to access and difficult to maintain machines. The capacity of mechanical water lifting equipment in the province has increased from more than 11,000 horsepower last year to more than 44,000 horsepower this year, and counties such as Yuechi and Tongnan, which are inconvenient to access, have each acquired twenty or thirty water pumps.

    四川采取措施推动工具改革加速实现农业半机械化
    土洋并举武装县社机械工业
    许多县、区、公社的农具厂已有五部机床，许多生产队有了五件基本工具
    全省基本上实现了水稻脱粒用打谷机，甘薯加工用半机械化工具；六十多个县实现了运输车子化
    本报成都18日电　四川省紧密结合农村的工具改革开展地方机械工业的“三五”运动，一年来许多县、区、人民公社的农具厂和生产队已经装备上机床和老虎钳、钢锯等基本工具，为农业向机械化进军提供了有利条件。
    “三五”运动是中共四川省委在去年9月提出的加速农业半机械化的一项主要措施。所谓“三五”运动就是要求全省每个县、区和部分人民公社的农具厂有五部机床，每个人民公社和部分生产队有套丝板、老虎钳、钢锯、钢锉、台钻等五大基本工具；并广泛利用水、火、畜、风、气（天然气、沼气等）五种动力资源。一年来，“三五”运动发展迅速。据不完全统计，目前各地共制造了车床、刨床、钻床等机床一万四千多部，五种工具十四万多件。内江、江津、温江、泸州、南充、重庆等许多专区的农具站修配站已普遍做到拥有“五机五具”或“三机五具”。
    过去，四川各地县以下的机械厂、农具厂设备都很简陋，很少有车床。为了加速武装地方机械工业，全省各级党委坚持了土洋并举、由土到洋的方针，批判了部分人想单纯依靠大工业支援的思想和畏难情绪，发动群众自力更生，大造土机床和简易机床。内江、温江等专区都是书记挂帅，层层安排，开展大协作，一个多月便初步实现了“三五”运动的要求。大巴县在运动中集中了全县铁木工匠，用土铁土钢造机床，边造边学，材料不够就发动群众卖铁卖料，大力采用代用品，突击十天造出了八十多台机床和一百七十多件工具，全县各农具厂都达到有五部机床。
    “三五”运动的开展，为许多人民公社提供了初具规模的机械制造装备，培养了大批技术工人。全省首创“三五”运动的乐至县，今年初制成了一百二十一部机床和五千多件工具。在这一基础上，又经过不断添造和修制，现在增加到三百八十多部机床，大部分由过去的木制或铁木结构的机床变成了全部铁制半土半洋或初步洋化的机床。精密度也大大提高；新制的五种工具，质量已经基本上赶上了“洋”产品。从前这个县只有二十多个技工，经过“三五”运动，现在全县已有一千七百多个车、钳、刨、铸等技工。
    “三五”运动推动了四川农村的工具改革向半机械化迅速迈进。随着大批新农具厂和修配站的建立，全省已初步形成了农具制造修配网，做到一般农具小修不出社，大修不出厂，制造不出县。去年还仅仅依靠少数城市生产的许多种新式农具，如步犁、播种机、轧花机、打谷机、架子车等，现在许多乡镇的农具厂都能制造。今年基本上实现了水稻脱粒用打谷机，甘薯加工使用各种半机械化工具，并有六十多个县的运输由肩挑背驮实现了带有滚珠轴承的车子化。绵阳县永兴人民公社今年麦收时制造了一百六十多部小麦收割机，二百三十多部小麦脱粒机和八千多部车子，小麦收割、脱粒、运输因而实现了半机械化，仅收割一项即节省了五万多个劳动日。
    “三五”运动为各地人民公社发展社办工业、使用农业机器创造了更好的条件。内江专区各县今年以来就制造了供给土化肥厂用的浓缩锅、粉碎机，农产品加工工厂用的切片机、压面机、轧花机以及防风机、马达、水泵等许多机器设备。仅乐至县制造出的马达就有十一台。有的地方还制造成功了小发电机。由于许多地方在“三五”运动后一般能修理和配制一般农业机械、抽水机、发电机甚至拖拉机的一些零件，也促进了过去一些交通不便、维修机器困难的地区大量添购农业机器。全省今年机械提水设备的能力从去年的一万一千多马力提高到四万四千多马力，交通不便的岳池、潼南等县每县都有了二、三十台抽水机。
