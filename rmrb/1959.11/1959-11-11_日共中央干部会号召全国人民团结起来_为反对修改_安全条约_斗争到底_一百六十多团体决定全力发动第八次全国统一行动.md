Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party Central Committee Cadre Meeting today published a message in "Akahata" calling on all party members to further strengthen the struggle to prevent the Kishi Nobusuke government from signing a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The message pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government is running counter to the world trend, is stepping up its activities to revise the "Security Treaty," is moving toward the road of nuclear war, is making national independence more difficult, and is intensifying the "Cold War" and international tension. The message expressed strong indignation and serious protest against this.

The message then emphasized the importance of the joint statement issued by the Chinese and Japanese Communist Parties not long ago; and pointed out that this statement is a historically significant document that correctly expresses the common aspirations of the people of the two countries in striving for peace in Asia and friendship between the people of China and Japan.

The message pointed out that in the current situation, the immediate task of the Japanese people is to demand an immediate halt to the negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty," to disclose the full truth of the negotiations, and to oppose Kishi Nobusuke's visit to the United States to sign a new "Security Treaty." These demands must be combined with the current demands of the people of all strata, and these demands must be submitted to the Kishi Nobusuke government and the special session of the Diet. At the same time, efforts must be made to ensure that all struggles move together in the direction indicated by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Japanese Communist Party to establish a national democratic united front.

The message pointed out that the unified action of Japanese democratic forces and the people to oppose the revision and strive for the abolition of the "Security Treaty" has overcome various difficulties and is continuing to move forward.

In its message, the Japanese Communist Party expressed the hope that the Socialist Party would smash the anti-communist plot of the Nishio faction and actively establish cooperative relations with all democratic forces.

The message called on the Japanese working class to make every effort to prepare for a nationwide strike.

The Japanese Communist Party called on all party members to do everything possible to promote the unity of democratic forces and all the people, stand at the forefront of the people, and fight to the end to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the "Security Treaty," to strive for the establishment of an independent, peaceful, neutral, and democratic Japan, and to safeguard the people's livelihood.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th dispatch: The National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," composed of more than 160 Japanese organizations, has decided to mobilize the maximum force on the 27th to successfully hold the Eighth National Unified Action against the Revision of the "Security Treaty."

The National Conference issued an appeal saying that the success or failure of our struggle depends on the people's power we mobilize.

The appeal called on as many people as possible to participate in the collective petitions to the government and local governments on the day of the Eighth Unified Action. The National Conference decided to mobilize 100,000 people to petition the Diet in Tokyo.

The appeal emphasized the need to organize farmers' rallies in rural areas. The appeal said that the National Conference plans to hold twenty-eight anti-"Security Treaty" rallies in rural areas by the end of the year. The appeal called on local branches to continue their efforts to involve all rural areas in the struggle.

The National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" also discussed today measures to strengthen coordination in the struggle inside and outside the Diet. The National Conference decided that the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" should be combined with the current struggle in the Diet against paying war reparations to South Vietnam.

The National Conference also decided to distribute hundreds of thousands of leaflets and send Socialist Party Diet members to various places to actively publicize opposition to the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the war reparations agreement signed with South Vietnam.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th dispatch: One hundred and twenty prominent figures from the Japanese cultural circles established a joint struggle organization in Tokyo on the evening of the 9th—the "Japan-U.S. Security Treaty Criticism Association." The meeting unanimously adopted a statement demanding that the government abandon its plan to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The meeting also passed a resolution on the current tasks of the "Japan-U.S. Security Treaty Criticism Association." The meeting announced that a large-scale lecture meeting will be held in Tokyo on November 26.

The meeting heard reports from the leaders of various cultural organizations on the activities their respective organizations have carried out to date. In their reports, they unanimously expressed their firm opposition to the government's revision of the "Security Treaty."
