Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, November 29th. The builders of the Liangfengya Tunnel on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, after setting a national monthly tunneling record in September, broke the national daily tunneling record on the 22nd of this month with a score of 43.58 meters.

Currently, the rock quality in the construction sections of the Liangfengya Tunnel is soft, and the groundwater has increased. One-fifth of the skilled veteran workers have been transferred to other construction sites. However, thanks to the rational allocation of labor among the various work sections, the extensive collaboration between them, and the deployment of the best pneumatic drill operators and the best pneumatic drills and hoses to support the work shifts undertaking the main attack tasks, the smooth construction of the entire tunnel project has been guaranteed.

    凉风垭职工又创新纪录
    据新华社贵阳二十九日电  川黔铁路凉风垭隧道的建设者继九月创全国月成洞最高纪录以后，本月二十二日又以四十三点五八米的成绩刷新了全国隧道日成洞纪录。
    目前，凉风垭隧道内的施工地段石质松软，地下水增大，技术熟练的老工人有五分之一调往其他工地。但是，由于各工段合理调配了劳力，展开了相互之间的大协作，抽调最优秀的风钻手和最好的风钻、皮管等工具，支援担负主攻任务的工班，因而保证了全部隧道工程的顺利施工。
