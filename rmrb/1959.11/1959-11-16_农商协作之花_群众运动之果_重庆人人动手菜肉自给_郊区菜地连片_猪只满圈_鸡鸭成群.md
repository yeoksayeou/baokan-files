Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 15th: As Chongqing resolutely implemented the policy of "relying mainly on self-reliance and striving for external assistance as a supplement" for the supply of urban non-staple foods, and launched a mass movement for the universal increase of non-staple food production, suburban vegetable plots became connected, pigsties were full, and chickens and ducks were abundant, changing the city's long-standing dependence on external supplies of non-staple foods. Vegetables, live pigs, and small poultry have achieved basic self-sufficiency according to the current local supply standards. The market supply of non-staple foods has further improved.

This year, Chongqing's non-staple food production plan is particularly ambitious. The annual target is to produce 1.7 million pigs, 7.5 million small poultry, and establish over 340,000 mu of vegetable bases. After ten months of great efforts by the people of the city, vegetable bases have been expanded to over 270,000 mu; the number of live pigs has increased to over 1.7 million, completing the annual plan, with a 31% increase in the number of pigs in stock compared to the end of last year; the number of small poultry has reached 7.7 million, exceeding the annual plan by 200,000, with the number in stock increasing by 4.28 times compared to the end of last year. Chongqing has traditionally produced very little fish, but this year fish farming reached over 200 million, an eightfold increase compared to last year. Since October, the people of the city have also harvested a large number of oil crops such as sunflowers and sesame.

In the first ten months of this year, Chongqing's vegetable production reached over 1.59 billion jin, an increase of 69% compared to the same period last year. In the first half of the year, the average person in the city consumed more than one jin of fresh vegetables per day, reaching the highest supply level in history, and eliminating the historical off-season for vegetable supply in April and May. The vegetable supply volume decreased temporarily in July and August due to the impact of the extraordinary drought, but after entering November, the supply of fresh vegetables has been rising steadily, and the current supply is trending towards normal. While striving for external assistance in terms of fat pigs and small poultry, the number of goods coming from the suburbs has also increased significantly. This year, the number of fat pigs slaughtered from the suburbs has reached over 300,000. Small poultry began to be marketed successively in September. Fish were also caught and supplied to the market early. Now, the variety and types of stir-fried dishes and braised dishes supplied in restaurants throughout the city are constantly increasing. The supply of fresh eggs, chickens, and ducks is also more abundant.

In the past ten months, in addition to continuing to promote the experience of agricultural-commercial cooperation, Chongqing has initially explored the experience of carrying out a mass movement for non-staple food production in the suburbs. Party committees at all levels first focused on vigorously developing specialized production teams for vegetable growing, pig raising, and poultry raising in various communes in the suburbs, allocating over 60,000 mu of feed bases, and building, expanding, and renovating a large number of pig farms, breeding pig farms, and poultry farms, and gradually expanding vegetable bases. In May and June of this year, according to the instructions of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chongqing also decentralized the task of pig raising to production teams, and adhered to the principle of public raising as the main focus, supplemented by public raising by individuals and private raising by individuals, establishing a large number of pig farms. Currently, there are more than 2,300 pig farms with 50 to 300 pigs, 20 farms with 300 to 1,000 pigs, and 6 farms with more than 1,000 pigs. Live pig production bases have been established in both near and far suburbs. Collectively raised pigs by communes account for 91% of the total number of pigs raised by communes. In terms of small poultry, in addition to mobilizing urban and rural people to raise them in large numbers, people's communes have also established 427 large and small poultry farms, with more than 2 million publicly raised poultry. The commodity rate of pigs, poultry, and other products produced by the bases has reached more than 50%.

A series of mass movements were also organized in all links such as sowing, mating, hatching, feed, pigsties, and epidemic prevention, so that the various difficulties in non-staple food production were quickly resolved. In August and September of this year, the suburbs encountered an extraordinary drought, and feed became difficult. Communes widely mobilized commune members and students to carry out the "one person, one handful of grass" movement, and collected feed from the water, land, and trees in many ways, achieving coarse feed being fed finely, and smoothly overcoming the feed barrier. Currently, districts and counties are carrying out a mass movement to store feed for the winter. In autumn mating and autumn hatching, various places have also adopted the method of launching mass movements to complete the work in one go. Ba County organized a mating team of more than 10,000 people to go deep into production teams and breeding farms to assist in mating. In more than 20 days, the county's livestock mating reached 98.5%, and the conception rate reached 94%. In the great development of live pigs and poultry, a large number of pigsties and poultry farms were needed, and communes mobilized the masses to build and expand using old empty houses and old timber. They also established 449 veterinary stations, 64 veterinary drug manufacturing factories, and a large number of feed processing plants using indigenous methods.

In addition, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also vigorously promoted the planting of vegetables, raising of pigs, raising of poultry, and planting of oil crops in organs, factories, mines, schools, stores, troops, and residents with suitable conditions, as a supplementary force. In a few months, collective units throughout the city raised more than 90,000 pigs, more than 940,000 poultry, and planted more than 20,000 mu of vegetables. Recently, organs, factories, mines, and residents have planted more than 80 million single-stalk high-yield "oilseed rape kings." Now more than 350 units have achieved self-sufficiency in pork and do not need state supplies.

In this way, taking the 50 people's communes in the suburbs as the main body, a city-wide mass movement for the large-scale development of non-staple food production, combining collective production and decentralized production, state participation, commune participation, individual participation, and everyone working together, was quickly formed.

Recently, the city has also formulated a specific plan to further increase non-staple food production. By the end of this year, the plan is to increase the number of live pigs to 2 million, basically reaching an average of one pig per person in the suburban rural population; the number of small poultry will increase to 10 million, achieving self-sufficiency; vegetable bases will be expanded to 345,000 mu, fully guaranteeing the needs of the people. In order to mobilize the people of the city to achieve this leap forward target, at the end of September, the Municipal People's Committee convened a city-wide commendation and awards rally for the leap forward in livestock, poultry, and vegetable production. More than 1,800 pace setters, experts, and representatives of advanced units on the non-staple food production front who attended the meeting summarized and promoted advanced experiences in production. At present, districts and counties have implemented the fourth quarter production increase plans to production teams and farmers. All 110,000 breeding sows of appropriate age in the city have been fully mated. In order to strengthen autumn epidemic prevention work, the city is carrying out a mass prevention work for swine fever, swine erysipelas, and swine influenza. More than 300,000 eggs have been placed in hatching rooms in various regions, and many commune members' families are also incubating chicks. The city is also preparing to carry out large-scale water conservancy construction this winter and next spring, so that the irrigation area of vegetable bases in the near suburbs will increase from the current 78% to more than 90%.

    农商协作之花  群众运动之果
    重庆人人动手菜肉自给
    郊区菜地连片  猪只满圈  鸡鸭成群
    以市郊五十个公社为主体，在全市范围内形成了一个集体生产和分散生产并举，国家干、公社干、个人干的大规模发展副食品生产的群众运动。全市生猪发展到170多万头，圈存数比去年底增加三分之一；小家禽发展到770万只，圈存数比去年底增四倍多；养鱼两亿多尾，比去年增加八倍。
    新华社重庆15日电　重庆市坚决贯彻城市副食品供应以“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的方针，开展全民大增产副食品运动以后，市郊菜地连片，猪只满圈，鸡鸭成群，改变了这个市一向依赖外地供应副食品的状况，蔬菜、生猪、小家禽按当地目前供应标准实现了基本自给。市场副食品供应更加好转。
    今年重庆市的副食品增产规划特别大。全年要生产猪一百七十万头、小家禽七百五十万只和建立蔬菜基地三十四万多亩。经过全市人民十个月的巨大努力，蔬菜基地已扩建到二十七万多亩；生猪头数已增加到一百七十多万头，完成了全年规划，其中圈存猪比去年底增加31％；小家禽达到七百七十万只，超额二十万只完成了全年规划，其中圈存数比去年底增加四点二八倍。重庆素来很少产鱼，今年养鱼达到二亿多尾，较去年增加八倍。10月以来，全市人民还丰收了大批向日葵和芝麻等油料作物。
    今年头十个月中重庆市蔬菜产量达到十五亿九千多万斤，比去年同期增长69％，上半年全市人民平均每人每天吃到鲜菜一斤以上，达到历年来的最高供应水平，消灭了4、5月间历史性的蔬菜供应淡季。7、8两月蔬菜供应量因生产受特大旱灾的影响一度下降，但进入11月份后，鲜菜上市量节节上升，目前供应已趋向正常。肥猪和小家禽在力争外援的同时，市郊的来货也增加很多。今年市郊出槽肥猪已达三十万头以上。小家禽在9月份即陆续上市。成鱼也早打捞，供应市场。现在全市菜馆中供应的炒菜、卤菜，花色和品种不断增加。鲜蛋、鸡鸭的供应也更充裕。
    重庆市在过去十个月中除继续推行农商协作的经验外，已初步摸索到在市郊开展副食品生产群众运动的经验。各级党委首先抓紧在市郊各个公社大力发展种菜、养猪、养禽的专业生产队，划出六万多亩饲料基地，兴建扩建和整修大批养猪场、种猪场、养禽场，逐步扩大蔬菜基地。今年5、6月间，根据中共四川省委指示，重庆市又把养猪任务下放到生产队，并坚持以公有公养为主，公有私养、私有私养为辅的原则，建立了大量的养猪场。目前全市有五十头到三百头的养猪场二千三百多个，三百头到一千头的二十个，一千头以上的六个。在近远郊区都成立了生猪生产基地。全市公社集体养的猪占公社养猪总数的91％。小家禽方面除了动员城乡人民大批饲养外，人民公社也建立了大小养禽场四百二十七个，公有公养家禽二百多万只。基地生产的猪、家禽等商品率已达50％以上。
    在播种、配种、孵化、饲料、猪舍、防疫等各个环节上也组织了一系列的群众运动，使副食品生产中的各种困难很快得到解决。今年8、9两月市郊曾遇到特大旱灾，饲料发生了困难，各公社广泛发动社员、学生开展“一人一把草”运动，并从水上、地上、树上多方面采集饲料，做到粗料精喂，顺利地度过了饲料关，目前各区县又开展了冬季贮藏饲料的群众运动。秋配秋孵中各地也采取开展群众运动的办法，一气呵成，巴县曾组织一万多人的配种队，深入生产队和饲养场，协助配种，在二十多天内全县家畜配种达到98.5％，受孕率达到94％。在生猪家禽大发展中，需要大批猪舍禽场，各个公社就发动群众利用旧空屋旧木材修建和扩建。他们还用土法建立了四百四十九个兽医站，六十四个兽药制造工厂和大批饲料加工厂等。
    此外，中共重庆市委还大力在有条件的机关、厂矿、学校、商店、部队、居民中提倡种菜、养猪、养禽、种植油料作物，作为辅助力量。不出数月，全市集体单位养猪九万多头，养禽九十四万多只，种菜二万多亩，最近机关、厂矿和居民等又种植了单株高产“油菜王”八千多万株。现在有三百五十多个单位猪肉已经自给，不需要国家供给。
    这样，以市郊五十个人民公社为主体，在全市范围内迅速形成了一个集体生产和分散生产并举，国家干、公社干、个人干、大家一齐动手大规模发展副食品生产的全民运动。
    最近，全市又制定了进一步增产副食品的具体规划。到今年底生猪计划发展到二百万头，按市郊农村人口平均基本上达到一人一头猪；小家禽发展到一千万只，实现自给；蔬菜基地扩建到三十四万五千亩，完全保证人民的需要。为动员全市人民实现这个跃进指标，9月底市人民委员会召开了全市家畜、家禽、蔬菜生产评选给奖再跃进誓师大会，出席大会的一千八百多名副食品生产战线上的标兵、能手和先进单位的代表在会上总结和推广了生产上的先进经验。目前，各区、县已把第四季度增产计划落实到生产队和农户。全市适龄的十一万头母猪已经全配满怀。为加强秋季防疫工作，全市正在开展一个群众性的猪瘟、肺疫、丹毒的预防工作。各地区的孵化房已上蛋三十多万个，许多社员家庭也正在孵抱小鸡。全市还准备在今冬明春大搞水利建设，使近郊区的蔬菜基地灌溉面积由目前的78％增加到90％以上。
