    The West Lake People's Commune in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, actively implements the policy of "taking grain as the key link, combining grain and livestock, comprehensive development, and overall balance." The number of pigs raised has developed to more than 10,000, averaging 1.9 pigs per mu of land. In the past ten months, more than 4,000 heads have been sold to the state, accumulating more than 50 million jin of pig manure, which has promoted the great development of agricultural production. The Hongsheng Team of Herong Commune in Dangyang, Hubei Province, has implemented the method of "dividing areas for fixed points, building farms in the fields, using fields to raise pigs, and using pigs to nourish fields," achieving simultaneous leaps in grain and livestock production. The Dangyang County Party Committee has requested that the entire county universally build field pig farms.

    一亩一头猪  粮畜双丰收
    浙江省杭州市西湖人民公社积极贯彻“以粮为纲、粮畜并举、全面发展、综合平衡”的方针，生猪发展到一万多头，平均每亩地有一点九头。十个月来共出售给国家四千多头，共积猪肥五千多万斤，促进了农业生产的大发展。湖北省当阳河溶公社红胜队实行“划片定点、田头建场、以田养猪、以猪养田”的办法，粮畜生产一齐跃进，当阳县委要求全县普建田头养猪场。
