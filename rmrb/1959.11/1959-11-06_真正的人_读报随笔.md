A True Person – Reading the Newspaper
　　Ye Mai

The People’s Daily published an article titled “People’s Commune Locks Up the Dragon” on page 4 on October 31st. The editor's note said that this is a very good article and worth reading carefully.

It is indeed a good article. It raises a very sharp question for people: What kind of person should you be in socialist construction? How to be a person?

This article broadly divides people in the same environment into two categories: One category is spirited, energetic, and "go wherever there are difficulties," like the heroic sons and daughters of the Zou Maoying Iron Girls Team; the other category is, as the editor's note says, "eyes looking upwards, looking at the sky, not seeing people," the "difficulty" theorists. The former makes difficulties bow their heads, while the latter bows their heads to difficulties. Only one word difference, but it expresses two philosophies: the former pursues the philosophy of heroism, the philosophy of promotion, which teaches people to become true masters of nature; the latter pursues the philosophy of slavery, the philosophy of regression, which teaches people to be content with the status quo, and can even be said to return people to the primitive state of animals like apes who simply rely on nature for everything.

The difference between humans and animals lies in the fact that humans have subjective initiative. Subjective initiative means that the subject reflects the object and acts on the object. Human action on the object is conscious, intentional, and purposeful. Animals are different. Animals can only rely on the gift of heaven, and their actions are unconscious, unintentional, and aimless. Engels said: "Animals merely use external nature, and simply change nature by their existence; while man forces nature to serve his own purposes, to dominate nature, by the changes he brings about. This is the final and main difference between man and other animals, and it is labour which brings about this difference." ("Dialectics of Nature," People's Publishing House Edition, p. 145) In the process of labor, that is, in the process of fighting against nature, the greater the consciousness, the greater the creativity, and the more fully the subjective initiative is brought into play, the further away from the animal kingdom, and the higher the person is elevated.

Our socialist society, because it can create a "conscious social production organization of planned production and planned distribution" based on the recognition of objective laws, people begin to be the masters of social relations, and only then "become the real and conscious masters of nature for the first time" (Engels). Socialism is an era in which the working people can hold their heads high and express their talents freely and maximize their subjective initiative; only then can people feel that they are truly human.

However, the clearest sign of whether subjective initiative has been promoted is the attitude taken towards difficulties. In the process of socialist construction, difficulties will always appear, not only in the past, but also now, and in the future. But this kind of difficulty is just a small wave in the "endless Yangtze River," and it will eventually be swept away by the torrent of construction. As soon as difficulties appear, the solutions to the difficulties will follow. Recognizing this, one can conquer difficulties with a commanding attitude. Conversely, one can only be intimidated by difficulties, sighing in the face of difficulties like the "difficulty" theorists.

The fact that the people's communes in the Linyi area have not only built small and medium-sized reservoirs, but also large-scale water conservancy projects, shows that under the same conditions, that is, under various difficulties such as lack of tools, materials, and experience, how great the difference is in whether or not subjective initiative is brought into play, and how great the power of subjective initiative is! What the "difficulty" theorists lack is precisely this subjective initiative; especially the current right-leaning opportunists, who even dare to smear the subjective initiative of the people as "petty-bourgeois fanaticism"! They are very much like an old woman sitting next to a towering building under construction, dizzy and dazed in the face of the scaffolding, grumbling: "You can't build without experts," "You can't move an inch without materials and tools"! Or saying something like: "You reckless people are overestimating yourselves," "The building is too high, it's breathless to climb up, the windows are too big, the sunlight is dazzling," and so on, a bunch of nonsense. The highest level of human beings is the heroes who dare to think and dare to do and give full play to their subjective initiative; the lowest level of human beings is these right-leaning conservatives!

Heroes like those in the Linyi area who capture dragons and tie tigers are countless in our country today. Just look at the heroes from all walks of life gathered in Beijing today, all of them are energetic, and their heroic spirit soars to the sky, "With 'doing' at the forefront, difficulties bow their heads," thus creating great achievements. It is precisely because they have fully brought their subjective initiative into play that they have become the vanguards of the times and the pioneers of a new life. They are not contaminated with a bit of slave habits and are never bound by habitual forces. Gorky once said to young people: "Children, don't be afraid of reality, don't bow your heads to reality. You have come into this world not to obey the old and rotten, but to create new and rational things." These words are a true portrayal of the spirit of our heroes today. And such people are precisely the kind of people that Gorky praised as people who should be written in large letters.

Of course, socialist society has created conditions for people to give full play to their subjective initiative, but in our country, especially in the past year or so, the reason why the working people have been able to create countless miracles, and the reason why their creativity has been able to erupt like molten lava, dazzlingly, everyone knows that this is the merit of our wise leader Comrade Mao Zedong. It is he who attaches the most importance to the role of people, it is he who has established the brilliant idea of "despising difficulties strategically and paying attention to difficulties tactically" among the people, it is he who has put forward the great call to break superstitions, emancipate the mind, and establish the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, and truly regards Marxist philosophy, revolutionary philosophy, as the proletariat's "liberated mind," thoroughly adhering to and popularizing Marxist dialectical materialism among the people, thus truly liberating the people from the "realm of necessity" and beginning to leap towards the "realm of freedom." Therefore, people living in the Mao Zedong era should strive to become heroes of labor and creation, to become true people, so as not to fail Comrade Mao Zedong's education of us.

    真正的人——读报随笔
    叶迈
    10月31日的人民日报第四版登了一篇题为“人民公社锁蛟龙”的文章。编者按说，这是一篇很好的文章，值得仔细阅读。
    的确是一篇好文章。它向人们提出了一个非常尖锐的问题：在社会主义建设中，你应当做什么样的人？怎样做人？
    这篇文章把处在同一环境中的人，大别之为两类：一类是，意气风发，干劲充沛，“哪里有困难就到哪里去”，如邹茂英钢铁姑娘队等那样的英雄儿女；一类是，如编者按所说的，“眼睛望上，看着青天，看不见人”的“困难”论者。前者是让困难低头，后者是向困难低头。仅仅一字之差，却表现了两种哲学：前者奉行的是英雄的哲学，促进的哲学，这种哲学教人成为做自然的主人的真正的人；后者奉行的是奴隶的哲学，促退的哲学，这种哲学教人安于现状，甚至可以说使人回复到单纯仰给于自然的猿猴一类动物的原始状态。
    人和动物的区别，就在于人有主观能动性。所谓主观能动性，就是主观反映客观并作用于客观。人对客观的作用是自觉的，有意识的，有目的的。动物则不然，动物只能靠天之赐，它们的行动是不自觉的，无意识的，无目的的。恩格斯说：“动物仅仅利用外面的自然界，单纯地以自己的存在来使自然界改变；而人则以他所引起的改变来迫使自然界服务于他自己的目的，来支配自然界。这便是人和其他动物最后的主要的区别，而引起这一区别的还是劳动。”（自然辩证法，人民出版社版，第一四五页）人在劳动过程中，也就是向自然作斗争的过程中，自觉性愈大，创造性愈大，主观能动性愈充分地发挥出来，也就脱离动物界愈远，把人提升到更高的一级上去。
    我们的社会主义社会，由于它能够依据对客观规律的认识，造成“有计划地生产和有计划地分配的有意识的社会生产组织”，人们开始做了社会关系的主人翁，也才“第一次成为自然界的真正的和自觉的主人翁”（恩格斯）。社会主义是劳动人民扬眉吐气的时代，他们可以完全自由地表现自己的才能，最大限度地发挥主观能动性；只有这时，人才感觉到自己是一个真正的人。
    然而，主观能动性是否发扬了的最鲜明的标志，要算是对待困难采取什么样的态度了。在社会主义建设过程中，困难总是会不断出现的，不仅过去有，现在有，将来还会有。但这种困难，只不过是“不尽长江滚滚来”之中的点点小浪花，它终会被建设的洪流席卷而下。困难一出现，解决困难的办法也就随之而来。认识到这一点，就能以高屋建瓴的气概，征服困难。反之，就只能被困难吓倒，像“困难”论者那样，在困难面前唉声叹气。
    临沂地区人民公社不但办了小型、中型水库，还举办了大型水利工程的事实说明，在同样的条件下，即在缺乏工具、材料、经验等种种困难的条件下，发挥主观能动性与否，该有多么大的差别，主观能动性该有何等巨大的力量！“困难”论者所缺少的，正是这种主观能动性；特别是目前那些右倾机会主义分子，竟然还敢把人民群众这种主观能动性污蔑之为“小资产阶级狂热性”哩！他们很像一个坐在正在建设的矗天大楼旁边的老太婆一样，面对着脚手架，就感到头晕目眩，咕咕噜噜：“没有专家不能施工呀”，“没有材料和工具寸步难行呀”！或者说什么：“你们这些冒失鬼，太不量力呀”，“楼太高了，爬起来要喘气呀，窗户太大了，阳光刺眼呀”，如此等等，鬼话连篇。人之高级，莫过于敢想敢做、充分发挥主观能动性的英雄人物；人之低级，也莫过于这些右倾保守分子了！
    像临沂地区那样的擒龙缚虎的英雄好汉，今天在我们国家里是数不胜数的。试看目前群集在北京的各路英雄，莫不是个个精神焕发，浩然之气冲霄汉，“干字当头，困难低头”，从而创造出丰功伟绩来。正因为他们充分发挥了主观能动性，他们才成为时代的尖兵，成为新生活的首创者。他们不沾染一点奴隶习气，从不被习惯势力所束缚。高尔基曾对青年们说过：“孩子们，不要害怕现实，不要向现实低头，你们来到这世界，不是为了要服从老朽的东西，而是要创造新的有理智的东西。”这几句话，正是对我们今天那些英雄人物的精神状态的写照。而这样的人，也正是高尔基所称颂的那种应当用大字来写的人。
    固然，社会主义社会为人们创设了充分发挥主观能动性的条件，但是，在我们的国家里，特别是一年多来，劳动人民所以能够创造出无数奇迹，他们的创造性所以能够如熔岩之喷射，光彩夺目地迸发出来，大家知道，这是我们英明的领袖毛泽东同志的功劳。正是他，最重视人的作用，正是他，在人民中间树立了“在战略上蔑视困难，在战术上重视困难”的光辉思想，正是他，提出了破除迷信、解放思想，树立敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格的伟大号召，真正把马克思主义的哲学，革命的哲学，作为无产阶级“解放的头脑”，彻底地坚持了和在人民群众中普及了马克思主义的辩证唯物主义，从而使人民群众真正地从“必然王国”中解放出来，开始向“自由王国”飞跃。因此，生活在毛泽东时代的人，都应当努力成为劳动和创造的英雄，成为真正的人，才不辜负毛泽东同志对我们的教育。
