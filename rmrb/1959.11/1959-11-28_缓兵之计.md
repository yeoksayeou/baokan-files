A Strategy to Gain Time
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

    Today, this newspaper published some materials about the United States stepping up its research and manufacturing of intercontinental missiles and intermediate-range missiles domestically, and accelerating the establishment and expansion of various missile bases around the world. These materials show that these actions by the United States are very inconsistent with some of the peaceful gestures made recently by the US authorities. While expressing a willingness to ease the international situation, the US ruling group has launched an arms race movement focusing on accelerating the development of missile weapons. How can we explain this duplicity?

    As everyone knows, the entire aggressive policy and war policy of US imperialism are based on its so-called "strength." However, in recent years, due to the rapid development and unprecedented strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, especially after the Soviet Union successfully launched intercontinental missiles, artificial satellites, and space rockets, the balance of world power has further shifted greatly in favor of socialism and against imperialism. This change has completely bankrupted the so-called military superiority that US imperialism used to flaunt. Some US military and political leaders cannot but admit the fact that when the Soviet Union has been able to accurately hit the moon 380,000 kilometers away with a space rocket, the US intercontinental missiles have not yet reached the predetermined distance. American commentator Alsop reported that "US Secretary of Defense McElroy confirmed that by 1962, the Soviet Union will lead in intercontinental missiles by a ratio of three to one." The famous American military commentator Baldwin also called the period from now to 1965 the "missile lag period" for the United States. Under these circumstances, the US aggressive clique cannot help but feel that it lacks the capital to pursue its aggressive and war policies. They believe that what needs to be done now is to do everything possible to accelerate the development of missiles and missile bases to regain its disadvantage in military strength and revitalize the "position of strength" of the United States. According to "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, in addition to strengthening the existing Vandenberg Air Force Missile Base in California, the United States is stepping up the establishment and planning of eleven intercontinental missile bases in other locations in the country. At the same time, the United States is accelerating the research, testing, and manufacturing of "Atlas," "Titan," and "Minuteman" intercontinental missiles, preparing to replace existing strategic bombers with these intercontinental missiles as the main part of the so-called "strike force" in the next few years. During this period of large-scale development of intercontinental missiles, the United States also intends to vigorously strengthen and expand its intermediate-range missile bases established in some of its vassal states in Western Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia to make up for its current shortcomings in intercontinental missiles. The US emphasis on the development of missile weapons can also be clearly seen in the US next year's military budget. Although this budget has not exceeded last year's level of 41 billion US dollars due to the heavy overall financial burden of the US government, the appropriations for conventional weapons and conventional forces have been greatly reduced, while the appropriations for the development of missiles have reached 7 billion US dollars, accounting for about one-sixth of the entire military budget. Some monopoly capital groups in the United States are competing for this missile military appropriation, which has huge profits to be made.

    Therefore, things are very clear. The peace tricks currently played by the United States are nothing more than a "strategy to gain time," the purpose of which is to buy time to expand its military strength, and at the same time paralyze the world's people's will to fight against the threat of war and strive for peace. This duplicity of the United States should be easily seen through. If the United States is truly interested in easing the tense situation, it should first stop this arms race activity of developing missiles and expanding missile bases. People all over the world can measure the value of the US ruling group's extravagant talk of peace from the actual actions of the US arms race.

    缓兵之计
    本报评论员
    本报今天发表了一些关于美国正在国内加紧研究和制造洲际导弹与中程导弹，和在世界各地加紧建立和扩充各种导弹基地的材料。这些材料说明，美国的这种行径，同美国当局最近所作的一些和平的姿态是很不调和的。美国统治集团一面表示愿意缓和国际局势，一面却掀起一个以加速发展导弹武器为重点的扩军备战运动，怎样来解释这种两面性呢？
    大家知道，美帝国主义的整个侵略政策和战争政策，是建立在它所谓的“实力”基础之上的。但是近年来，由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营力量的迅速发展和空前强大，特别是在苏联成功地发射了洲际导弹、人造卫星和宇宙火箭以后，世界力量的对比进一步大大有利于社会主义而不利于帝国主义的变化，使得美帝国主义过去所炫耀的所谓军事优势完全破产。美国的一些军政首脑人物不能不承认这样的事实：当苏联已经能够用宇宙火箭准确地击中三十八万公里以外的月球的时候，美国的洲际导弹却还不能达到预定的距离。美国评论员艾尔索普报道说，“美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊确认，在1962年以前，苏联在洲际导弹方面将以三比一领先”。美国著名军事评论员鲍尔温也把从现在起到1965年的时期称为美国的“导弹落后时期”。在这种情况下，美国侵略集团不能不感觉到要推行它的侵略政策和战争政策缺少本钱了。他们认为现在需做的是竭尽全力加速发展导弹和导弹基地，来挽回它在军事力量上的劣势，重振美国的“实力地位”。据“美国新闻与世界报道”周刊透露，美国现在除了加强现有的加利福尼亚州范登堡空军导弹基地外，还在国内其他地点加紧建立和计划建立十一个洲际导弹基地。同时，美国正在加速进行“阿特拉斯式”、“大力神式”和“民兵式”洲际导弹的研究试验与制造工作，准备在今后几年内以这些洲际导弹来代替现有的战略轰炸机，作为所谓“打击力量”的主要部分。在大规模发展洲际导弹的这段期间，美国还准备大力加强和扩充它在西欧、中东与东亚的一些仆从国家内建立的中程导弹基地，以弥补它今天在洲际导弹方面的不足。美国着重发展导弹武器的趋向，也可以从美国下年度的军事预算中看得清楚。这个预算虽然由于美国政府的整个财政负担沉重而未超过去年四百一十亿美元的水平，但是其中对常规武器和常规部队的拨款大为削减，而用来发展导弹的拨款则达七十亿美元之巨，即占整个军事预算的六分之一左右。美国的一些垄断资本集团，正在为这笔有暴利可图的导弹军事拨款而进行角逐。
    因此，事情就很明白了，美国目前所玩弄的和平把戏，不过是一种“缓兵之计”，目的在于争取时间来扩充自己的军事力量，同时麻痹世界人民反对战争威胁和争取和平的斗志。美国的这种两面手法应该是很容易被识破的。美国如果真有心于缓和紧张局势的话，首先应当停止这种发展导弹、扩大导弹基地的备战活动。全世界人民都可以从美国的扩军备战的实际行动中来衡量美国统治集团侈谈和平的价值。
