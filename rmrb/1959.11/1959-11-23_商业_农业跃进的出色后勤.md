    Commerce – Outstanding Logistics for the Agricultural Leap Forward
    Supply of irrigation and drainage machinery exceeds last year / Fertilizer supply nearing completion of annual plan / Pesticide supply exceeds annual plan
    Commercial departments in various regions, guided by the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods and utilizing local materials, mobilized the masses to manufacture local fertilizers, local pesticides, and small farm tools, implementing local production and local supply, with remarkable results.

    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd – Commercial departments in various regions have vigorously strengthened the supply of agricultural production materials and farmland water conservancy construction equipment, playing a significant role in supporting the continued leap forward in agricultural production this year.

    Thanks to increased raw material allocation and expanded production by the state, the supply of irrigation and drainage machinery, fertilizers, pesticides, and other items has greatly increased this year. By the end of October, commercial departments' supply of irrigation and drainage machinery to rural areas had already exceeded the total supply for the entire previous year by 37%, fertilizer supply had reached 94.2% of the estimated annual supply, and pesticide supply had exceeded the annual plan by 1.4%. To adapt to the currently vigorously developing mass movements for water conservancy construction and short-distance transportation, commercial departments have listed the supply of water conservancy construction equipment as their top priority. In addition to distributing over one million shovels, picks, iron hammers, spikes, iron wire, etc., to various regions for the fourth quarter, the Ministry of Commerce recently held a replenishment meeting and decided to replenish even more equipment before the end of the year, exceeding the total supply from January to September this year by 44%.

    While the central government allocates a portion of materials, commercial departments in various regions, under the leadership of the Party committees, have generally mobilized the masses to vigorously develop local fertilizers, local pesticides, and manufacture small farm tools using local steel and iron, implementing local production and local supply, with very significant results, guided by the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods and utilizing local materials. Guangdong Province alone utilized over 15,000 tons of local steel and iron from January to September to produce over 7.2 million pieces of various farm tools and small hardware items, playing an important role in ensuring the supply of agricultural production materials throughout the province. Xingning County, which achieved the most outstanding results, not only met all its own needs for farm tools and daily necessities produced using local steel and iron but also supported other counties. The production of local pesticides and local fertilizers, which flourished last year, has been further consolidated and improved this year. According to statistics from the ten provinces and cities of Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Hubei, Henan, Shaanxi, and Jiangsu, as of the end of September, a total of over 320,000 local fertilizer plants had been established, producing over 100 million tons of local fertilizer, and over 175,000 local pesticide plants had been established, producing 1.95 million tons of local pesticides. Commercial departments have provided a series of specific assistance in terms of funding, technology, and material supply to these local fertilizer and pesticide plants. Commercial departments in many provinces and counties have helped people's communes create methods of using pesticides such as "local first, then foreign," "local and foreign combined," or "local prevention, foreign cure," which greatly improved the insecticidal effect. Santai County in Sichuan Province mixed many local and foreign pesticides in a certain proportion, which not only increased the effectiveness by four or five times but also saved costs.

    Commercial employees in various regions are determined to serve as a good "logistics department" for agricultural production, which was most prominently demonstrated in the struggle to support agriculture against natural disasters in the third quarter. Many regions put forward the slogan "Where there is water, there is fertilizer; where there are insects, there are pesticides; disaster areas are turned into high-yield areas." In the two months of the anti-disaster struggle alone, the Ministry of Commerce transferred more than 90,000 tons of fertilizers and pesticides; more than 50,000 tons of gasoline, kerosene, diesel, lubricating oil, etc., to support disaster-stricken areas. Commercial departments in Hebei, Liaoning, and other provinces and cities with relatively minor disasters demonstrated the spirit of communist cooperation by transferring 270,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery and commodities such as water pumps and rubber hoses to support the anti-disaster struggle in other regions; and ensuring that they were delivered wherever they were needed and whenever they were needed.

    In terms of supply methods, commercial departments in various regions have generally increased supply points and carried out reasonable storage, allocation, and transportation work. According to the principle of "more above and less below, more storage in transportation hubs, and earlier supply in remote areas," commercial departments in Henan Province made reasonable arrangements for commodities such as pesticides and fertilizers. They set up fourteen storage points and nine direct transportation points in the province's transportation hubs. In Xuchang County, pesticides were delivered within four hours after the discovery of insect pests. Therefore, although insect pests were relatively serious in this province this year, most of them were completely eliminated during the larval stage. In addition to ensuring that pesticides were delivered on the same day that insect pests occurred, commercial departments in Shandong Province also dispatched technicians, carrying their own parts, food, and tools, to people's communes to repair damaged farm tools and machinery, so that a large number of old farm tools and machinery could be put back into production.

    Commercial departments in various regions are currently also making preparations to support rural spring plowing, spring planting, and spring irrigation production next year.

    商业——农业跃进的出色后勤
    排灌机械供应量超过去年  化肥供应年计划接近完成  农药供应超额完成年计划
    各地商业部门根据土洋并举就地取材的方针，发动群众制造土化肥、土农药和小农具，实行就地生产就地供应，效果显著。
    新华社22日讯　各地商业部门大力加强农业生产资料和农田水利建设器材的供应工作，对支持今年农业生产继续跃进起了很大作用。
    由于国家增拨原料、材料，扩大生产，今年排灌机械、化肥、农药等供应量大大增加。到10月底止，商业部门供应农村的排灌机械已经超过去年全年供应量37％，化肥完成全年预计供应量的94.2％，农药供应已超额1.4％完成全年计划。为了适应目前蓬勃开展的兴修水利和短途运输群众运动，商业部门已经把水利建设器材的供应工作列为当前的首要任务。商业部除了把第四季度供应各地的一百多万把铁锹、洋镐、铁锤、元钉、铁丝等全部分配下去以外，最近又召开补货会议，决定年前增补的器材，比今年1至9月份供应量的总和还多44％。
    在中央调拨一部分物资的同时，各地商业部门在党委领导下，根据土洋并举就地取材的方针，普遍发动群众大搞土化肥、土农药和利用土钢土铁制造小农具，实行就地生产就地供应，效果十分显著。广东省仅1至9月份就利用土钢土铁一万五千多吨，生产各种农具和小五金七百二十多万件，对于保证全省农业生产资料的供应起了重要作用。其中成绩最突出的兴宁县，利用土钢土铁生产的农具和生活用品，不但能全部满足本县的需要，而且还支援了外县。去年蓬勃发展起来的土农药、土化肥生产，今年有了进一步的巩固和提高。据北京、河北、山西、浙江、安徽、山东、湖北、河南、陕西、江苏十个省市的统计，截至9月底共已建立土化肥厂三十二万多座，生产土化肥一亿多吨，建立土农药厂十七万五千多座，生产土农药一百九十五万吨。对于这些土化肥厂和土农药厂，商业部门在资金、技术和物资供应等方面给了一系列的具体帮助。许多省、县的商业部门帮助人民公社创造了“先土后洋”、“土洋混合”或“土防洋治”等使用农药的办法，大大提高了杀虫效果。四川省三台县把许多土洋农药按一定比例混合使用，不但使用效果增加四、五倍，而且节省了费用。
    各地商业职工决心当好农业生产的“后勤部”，这在第三季度的支援农业抗灾斗争中表现得最为突出。许多地区提出了“有水就有肥、有虫就有药，灾区变成丰产区”的口号。仅商业部在抗灾斗争的两个月中，就调出化肥、农药九万多吨；汽油、煤油、柴油、润滑油等五万多吨，支援受灾地区。受灾较轻的河北、辽宁等省市的商业部门，发挥共产主义协作精神，调出了二十七万马力的排灌机械和水泵、胶管等商品，支援其他地区的抗灾斗争；而且做到哪里需要就送到哪里，什么时候需要就什么时候运到。
    在供应方法上，各地商业部门普遍增设供应点，进行了合理的储备、调剂和调运工作。河南省商业部门根据“上多下少，交通要道储备多，偏僻地区供应早”的原则，对农药和化肥等商品作了合理摆布。他们在全省交通要道设立了十四个储备点、九个直运点，许昌县发现虫害四小时后农药就全部运到。因此，这个省今年虫害虽然比较严重，但大部分都在幼虫时期就被彻底消灭。山东省商业部门除了做到在虫害发生的当天就保证运到农药以外，还派出技术人员，自带零件、口粮和工具，到人民公社修理损坏了的农具药械，使大批旧农具和药械重新投入生产。
    各地商业部门目前还同时为支援农村明年的春耕、春播、春灌生产做好准备工作。
