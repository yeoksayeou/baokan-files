Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, November 20th: The "Wuga Gang" area of Lhasa, once the darkest corner under the serf system, has been transformed into a place full of light and joy in just a few months, now that the Tibetan people have begun to manage themselves. Lhasa citizens now call this place "Happiness Gang."

During the rule of the former Tibetan local government, "Wuga Gang" was the most polluted place in Lhasa. A saying circulated among the citizens: "Once you enter 'Wuga Gang,' disaster is everywhere." There were only sixty-five households here, but there were twelve casinos, four taverns, one opium den, and three brothels. Thirty-eight households were forced by life to become hooligans, thieves, and beggars. Nobles, Tibetan soldiers, gamblers, and drunkards came and went, gambling, drinking, raping women, fighting, and robbing—everything imaginable, it was simply a "hell on earth." Around "Wuga Gang," sewage formed lakes, garbage formed hills, and the stench was overwhelming.

As soon as the rebellion in the Lhasa area was quelled, the Lhasa Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal Military Control Commission, based on the demands of the citizens, established neighborhood committees and work teams in various urban areas. They sent many Tibetan and Han cadres to work with the citizens to completely eradicate the wounds and residual poisons left by the former Tibetan local government. Under the leadership of the Lhasa Municipal Military Control Commission, "Wuga Gang" rapidly changed its face. All residents were organized, the accumulated garbage was cleared, the stinking ponds were drained, many ditches were dug, public toilets were built, and a cultural and political school was established. During the democratic reform and cultural and political study movements, "Wuga Gang" became the red flag post of the East City District. Thanks to the Party's deep concern, more than fifty households and forty-two orphans and disabled people received relief from the People's Government, receiving zanba, tea, butter, and clothing, and many people without housing were given homes. More than seventy people suffering from syphilis and venereal diseases received free treatment, and many found legitimate jobs with the help of the Municipal Military Control Commission. Residents spontaneously organized mutual aid groups for handicrafts such as clothing, shoe making, sewing, ironwork, and wool weaving. Twenty Tibetan young adults became construction workers, and twenty-seven Tibetan children attended the "Wuga Gang" people's school and Lhasa Elementary School.

Now, every family in "Wuga Gang" lives and works in peace and contentment. People no longer regard this place as a dangerous path. The working people who were tortured and persecuted in the past have begun to live a happy life today, and everyone has their own bright future. Gongga Queji, who had always been a maid for the nobles, is now in a carpet factory and has become a worker. Jiangba Yongdeng, 45, was a langsheng for serf owners for half his life and is now the deputy director of the "Wuga Gang" Residents Committee, often leading the masses in production and transportation, transformed from a slave into a master.

    过去人间地狱　今日幸福乐园
    拉萨迂噶岗面貌完全改观
    新华社拉萨20日电　曾经是农奴制度下最阴暗一角的拉萨市“迂噶岗”地方，在西藏人民开始自己管理自己的时代里，仅仅几个月已经变成一个充满光明和欢乐的地方，现在，拉萨市民们把这块地方称为“幸福岗”。
    在原西藏地方政府统治时期，“迂噶岗”是拉萨市最污浊的地方。市民中流传着这样一句话：“进了‘迂噶岗’，处处是灾殃”。这里只有六十五户居民，但设有十二处赌场，四个酒馆，一家大烟馆，三处暗娼，有三十八户居民被生活逼迫沦为流氓小偷和乞丐。贵族、藏军、赌徒、酒鬼，在这里进进出出，赌钱酗酒，奸污妇女，打架抢劫，样样都有，简直成了“人间地狱”。在“迂噶岗”的周围，污水成湖，垃圾成丘，臭气熏人。
    拉萨地区叛乱刚一平息，中共拉萨市委和市军管会便根据市民的要求，在各城区成立了居民委员会和工作组，派出了很多藏汉族干部和市民一起，彻底根治原西藏地方政府遗留下来的创伤和余毒。在拉萨市军管会的领导下，“迂噶岗”迅速改变了面貌，居民全部组织起来，清除了淤积的垃圾，排除了臭水塘，修挖了很多条阴沟，建立了公共厕所，办起了文化政治学校。在民主改革和学习文化政治等运动中，“迂噶岗”成了东城区的红旗岗。由于党的深切关怀，五十多户居民和四十二个孤儿、残废者得到了人民政府的救济，领到了糌粑、茶叶、酥油和衣服，很多没有房子住的人有了住房。七十多个患梅毒、花柳病的人得到了免费治疗，很多人在市军管会的帮助下找到了正当职业。居民们自动组织起被服、鞋业、缝纫、铁工、毛织等手工业生产互助组。有二十个藏族青壮年成了建筑工人，二十七个藏族儿童上了“迂噶岗”的民校和拉萨小学。
    现在的“迂噶岗”家家安居乐业，人们不再把这里视为畏途，过去被摧残、迫害的劳动人民，今天开始过着幸福生活，每个人有了自己的光明前程。过去一直给贵族当女佣人的贡噶却吉，现在进了地毯厂，成了工人。四十五岁的姜巴永登，给农奴主当了半辈子朗生，现在是“迂噶岗”居民委员会的副主任委员，经常带领群众搞生产和运输，由奴隶变成了主人。
