	Earth-Shaking Changes
	中共毕节地方委员会 (The CPC Bijie Local Committee)
	The Bijie Special Zone in northwestern Guizhou Province has undergone earth-shaking changes in the past decade.

	This area is located in the Liangshan area of Guizhou, at an altitude of 1,500 to 3,000 meters, the spine of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. It is inhabited by more than three million people of various ethnic groups, including Han, Yi, Miao, Hui, and Gelao. It is cold and windy here, with high mountains, shallow water, barren soil, and thin topsoil. Before liberation, it was one of the poorest areas in the mountainous regions of Guizhou. Politically, this area was also one of the most backward in the country before liberation. In a considerable area of ​​land, the medieval feudal serf system was still maintained, and the broad masses of working people lived a miserable and impoverished life.

	However, since the liberation of the Bijie Special Zone in 1949, under the leadership of the Party, it has victoriously completed democratic reforms and developed the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In particular, the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the communization of rural areas in 1958 provided extremely favorable conditions for the thorough transformation of the mountainous areas. Now, this most barren and backward area is rapidly being transformed into a land of abundance. The 99 people's communes in the entire special zone have fully demonstrated the superiority of "large scale and a high degree of public ownership" in the past year of production, enabling the total grain output of the entire region this year to reach 3,207 million catties, an increase of 21.3% over last year, equivalent to 3.6 times the total grain output in 1949; the total industrial output value has also greatly increased. With the development of production, the income and living standards of commune members have greatly improved.

	In the struggle against nature, the people of the alpine mountains first declared war on "land" and the "Dragon King." According to the characteristics of high mountains, little water, barren soil, and thin topsoil in this area, the CPC Bijie Prefectural Committee called on the people of the entire region to vigorously promote the "enriching the lean soil" and "water climbs the slopes" movements. Every year in the late winter and early spring, crowds of people all over the mountains and plains were picking up fertilizer mud, scraping rock ash, carrying sand, and transporting lime to "enrich" the acidic, lean cultivated land. According to statistics, the soil of 2.62 million mu of cultivated land in the region has been improved, accounting for more than 40% of the total cultivated land area. All the improved soil has increased production by at least 10%, and a considerable part of the land has even increased production by two or three times; many barren lands that did not produce any grain in the past have now become fertile fields, and some have even broken the 1,000-catties-per-mu mark. In the huge water conservancy projects, the hard work people have put in has also yielded fruitful results. Up to now, more than 100,000 various water conservancy projects have been completed in the region, with a storage capacity of 791 million cubic meters, fundamentally changing the situation of "nine droughts in ten years, one rain brings disaster." Many farmers have been trained to become local experts in the water conservancy movement. The Huatan River water conservancy project in Jinsha County is 85 li long, crosses more than 70 mountain bends, and climbs over 33 mountain peaks; the Guoquandong water conservancy project in Dafang County draws water from the Yin River from cliffs more than 30 meters high to serve farmland and people's lives. These water conservancy projects fully demonstrated their power in overcoming this year's severe drought.

	The movement to improve soil and build water conservancy projects has fundamentally changed the grain production situation in the region. Before liberation, the average ration per person per year here was only more than 100 catties, and hunger enveloped the entire mountainous area. The "?裢塘" in the north of Weining city and the "mass graves" on the banks of the Kuadu River were filled with the bodies of those who died of starvation in those years. Now, these are just memories of the past. Last year, the average ration per person in the region was 738 catties, and this year it jumped to 962 catties.

	The Bijie Special Zone, known as the pastoral area of ​​Guizhou, has also seen great development in animal husbandry in recent years. The output value of animal husbandry in the region accounts for about 20% to 30% of the total agricultural output value. At present, the number of cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep has grown to more than 2.79 million, with an average of more than three pigs and sheep per household. Compared with the early days of liberation, the number of cattle and horses has increased by 60% to 80%, and the number of pigs and sheep has more than doubled. The quality of livestock has also been significantly improved, fundamentally changing the past situation of "pigs with flat skin and bones, sheep with small and sparse hair." The region has successively established 31 state-owned breeding stations, actively introducing and breeding local fine breeds of livestock from home and abroad, basically realizing the improvement of livestock breeds. All of Weining's more than 50,000 adult ewes have been replaced with fine breeds through crossbreeding, drug-induced estrus, and artificial insemination. The lambs born are all fine-wool sheep. The amount of wool sheared from this fine-wool sheep is three and a half times more than that of local sheep, and it is fine, soft, and smooth. The beavers introduced from the Soviet Union have settled in the alpine mountains and will soon be able to provide a large number of precious beaver skins.

	While grain production and animal husbandry in the region are developing rapidly, industry has also grown rapidly from scratch. Iron, lead, zinc, raw coal, sulfur, and power generation have all increased significantly. Before liberation, there was no mechanical industry here at all. Now, there are 14 county-level or higher mechanical farm implement factories. The repair shop, which started with a pair of pliers in 1952, has become a special zone mechanical factory with 59 lathes. Driven by the mass campaign to make steel, the face of the Shuicheng steel base has undergone rapid changes, laying a preliminary foundation for the development of steel production in the region.

	Transportation and postal and telecommunications services have also developed greatly. This closed mountainous area is now covered with a network of roads extending in all directions. Now, not only are all counties accessible by cars, but also 50% of the communes and about one-third of the administrative regions are accessible by cars. The Neikun Railway, one of the arteries of Southwest China, will pass through the eastern part of the region, and tens of thousands of workers are building roadbeds and tunnels here. All administrative regions of the commune and some production teams have access to telephones and broadcasting lines. Every dusk and dawn, wired broadcasts bring the voices of Beijing and Guiyang. The mountainous area is no longer closed, and the farmers here can know the most important news of the province, the country, and the world on the same day.

	Due to the high-speed development of production, the material and cultural life of the masses has been significantly improved. The broad masses of commune members sincerely thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and enthusiastically praise the people's communes. They said: The people's communes brought "three worries less": no worries about eating, no worries about clothing, and no worries about family. In terms of cultural and educational undertakings, 90% of school-age children have been enrolled in school, and primary education has been basically universalized; secondary education and normal education have also developed rapidly. Workers' and peasants' spare-time education has also achieved remarkable results, and about 60% of young and middle-aged people have shaken off the illiteracy label. Medical institutions have also been widely established, with hospitals in the communes, health clinics in the administrative regions, and health workers in the production teams. Several major diseases that pose the greatest threat to people's health, such as smallpox, relapsing fever, and typhus, have been basically eliminated or greatly reduced, and the health and physical fitness of the people have been significantly enhanced.

	All these brilliant achievements in the past decade are due to the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. Inspired by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in the region are even more inspired and determined to build the alpine mountains into a paradise with greater enthusiasm.

    翻天覆地的变化
    中共毕节地方委员会
    贵州省西北部的毕节专区，十年来发生了翻天覆地的变化。
    这个地区处于贵州的凉山地带，拔海一千五百米到三千米，是云贵高原的脊背。境内居住着汉、彝、苗、回、仡佬等三百多万各族人民，这里天寒风凉，山高水浅，土瘦地皮薄，解放前是贵州山区的一个最贫瘠地区。在政治上，这个地区在解放前也是全国最落后的地区之一。在相当大面积的土地上，还保持着中世纪的封建农奴制度，广大劳动人民过着悲惨穷困的生活。
    但是，毕节专区人民自1949年解放以来，在党的领导下，胜利地完成了民主改革，发展了互助合作运动；特别是1958年实现了工农业生产的大跃进和农村的人民公社化，为彻底改造山区提供了极其有利的条件。现在这个最贫瘠落后的地区已在迅速地改变为富饶之乡。全专区九十九个人民公社，在一年来的生产中充分发挥了“一大二公”的优越性，使今年全区粮食总产量达到三十二亿零七百多万斤，比去年增长21.3％，等于1949年粮食总产量的三点六倍；工业总产值也大大增长。随着生产的发展，社员们的收入和生活水平都大大地提高了。
    高寒山区人民在与自然作斗争中，首先是向“土地”和“龙王”开战。中共毕节地委根据本区山高、水少、土瘦、地皮薄的特点，号召全区人民大搞“瘦土添膘”、“河水爬坡”运动。每年冬末春初，漫山遍野的人流在挑肥泥、刮岩灰、抬沙土、运石灰，给酸性重的和瘦薄的耕地“加膘”。据统计，全区有二百六十二万亩耕地的土壤经过改良，占耕地总面积的40％以上。所有改良过的土壤，至少增产10％，有相当一部分土地甚至增产两三倍；许多过去根本不出粮食的荒废土地，现在也变成肥沃的良田，有的亩产突破千斤大关。在规模巨大的水利工程中，人们付出的辛勤劳动，也收到了丰硕的果实。到目前为止，全区已修好各种水利工程十万多处，引蓄水量达七亿九千一百万方，基本上改变了“十年九旱，一雨成灾”的面貌。许多农民在修水利运动中锻炼成了土专家。金沙县花滩河水利工程，长八十五里，跨过七十多道山弯，爬过三十三个山头；大方县锅圈洞水利，把阴河里的水从三十多丈高的悬崖峭壁上引出来，为农田和人民生活服务。这些水利工程，在战胜今年的严重干旱中，充分显示了威力。
    改良土壤和兴修水利运动，使全区的粮食生产状况发生了根本性的变化。解放前，这里每人每年的平均口粮只有一百多斤，饥饿笼罩着整个山区。威宁城北的?裢塘和夸都河畔的“万人坑”，堆满了当年饿死者的尸体。现在，这些都只是历史的回忆了。去年全区平均每人已有口粮七百三十八斤，今年则跃到九百六十二斤。
    被称为贵州牧区的毕节专区，这里的畜牧业几年来也有极大的发展。全区畜牧业的产值约占农业总产值的20％到30％。目前，牛、马、猪、羊已发展到二百七十九万多头，平均每户有猪羊三头以上。同解放初期比较，牛马增长60％到80％，猪羊增长一倍以上。牲畜的质量也有显著提高，从根本上改变了过去“猪扁皮包骨，羊小毛短稀”的状况。全区先后建立国营繁殖站三十一所，积极从国内外引进和选育本地牲畜良种，基本上实现牲畜良种化。威宁的五万多头成年母羊，全部改用良种杂交、药物催情和人工授精，生下的羊羔都是细毛羊。这种细毛羊的剪毛量比本地羊多三倍半，而且细软光滑。从苏联引进的海狸鼠，已在高寒山区安家落户，不久就可以提供大量的名贵的狸皮。
    在全区粮食生产和畜牧业迅速发展的同时，工业也从无到有，迅速成长壮大。铁、铅、锌、原煤、硫磺、发电量都有很大增长。解放前这里根本没有机械工业，现在已拥有县级以上的机械农具厂十四个。1952年由一把老虎钳起家的修配厂，已成为拥有五十九台车床的专区机械厂了。在全民大炼钢铁运动的推动下，水城钢铁基地的面貌发生了日新月异的变化，为全区钢铁生产的发展奠定了初步的基础。
    交通运输和邮电事业也有极大的发展。这个闭塞的山区已布满四通八达的公路网，现在不仅县县都通汽车，而且有50％的公社和三分之一左右的管理区可以通汽车。西南地区的动脉之一——内昆铁路，将从本区东部穿过，成千上万的工人正在这里开路基、筑隧道。公社的全部管理区和部分生产队都通电话和广播线，每到黄昏和清晨，有线广播就送来了北京的、贵阳的声音。山区不再是闭塞的了，这里的农民能够知道当天全省、全国、全世界的最重要的新闻。
    由于生产的高速度发展，群众的物质文化生活有了显著的提高。广大社员衷心感激共产党和毛主席，热情地歌颂人民公社。他们说：人民公社带来了“三不焦”：一不焦吃，二不焦穿，三不焦家。在文化教育事业方面，90％的学龄儿童都已入学，基本上普及了小学教育；中学教育和师范教育也发展很快。工农业余教育也取得了显著成绩，60％左右的青壮年已摘掉文盲帽子。医疗机构也广泛建立起来，公社有医院，管理区有卫生所，生产队有保健员。对人民健康危害最大的天花、回归热和斑疹伤寒等几种主要疾病，已经基本消灭或大大减少，人民群众的健康状况和体质得到了显著的增强。
    十年来所取得的这一切辉煌的成就，都是由于有党和毛主席正确领导的结果。全区各族人民在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，更加振奋，决心以更大的干劲把高寒山区建成乐园。
