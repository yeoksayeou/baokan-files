    Thoughts on Film Titles
    A meaningful film title is truly the finishing touch for a film.
    Some of our films deeply loved by the masses, such as "The White Haired Girl," "Red Flag on Cuigang Mountain," "Steel Warrior," "Southward Conquest and Northward War," and "Heroes Conquer the Great Northern Wilderness," all have titles that are very distinctive, concise, and vividly reveal the essence of the entire film.
    Titles like "The Veteran's New Story," which are literarily profound, highly evocative, popular, and have a national style, are even more outstanding. The image of the straightforward old soldier, infinitely loyal to the revolution, is deeply etched in the audience's mind. The title "The Veteran's New Story" further deepens the character's revolutionary optimism. However, some titles are not so ideal, such as "A Proposal" and "Women Representatives," even though the content may be good. It is hoped that filmmakers will put more effort into the film titles, so that the audience can also derive aesthetic enjoyment from the titles.

    有感于影片的名称
    一个意味深长的片名，对一部影片来说真是画龙点睛。
    我们的一些深受群众喜爱的影片像：“白毛女”、“翠岗红旗”、“钢铁战士”、“南征北战”、“英雄战胜北大荒”等，这许多影片的片名都很有性格、概括而形象地揭示出全片的精华。
    像“老兵新传”这样文学意味深长、形象性强、通俗而有民族风格的片名更为出色。豪爽、对革命无限忠诚的老战的影子深深镂刻在观众的心中。“老兵新传”这一片名就更加深了人物的革命乐观主义。但是有的也不太理想，例如“一件提案”、“妇女代表”，虽然内容也都还不错，但这些名字却很平淡、单调。希望电影制作者们在片名上多花些心血，让观众从片名上也能得到美的享受。
