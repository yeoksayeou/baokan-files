Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 20th (TASS): The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Voroshilov, held a banquet in the Kremlin to entertain the President of the Republic of Guinea, Touré, and his entourage.

　　Voroshilov said in his speech at the banquet that the Soviet people and the Soviet government deeply understand the efforts made by the Guinean people to consolidate their country's independence and to develop their national economy and culture.

　　Voroshilov said that for the people of African countries who have not yet gained national independence, the Republic of Guinea is an encouraging example. Voroshilov expressed his belief that Sekou Touré's visit to the Soviet Union would open up broader prospects for cooperation between the people of Guinea and the Soviet Union.

　　Sekou Touré said in his reply that the Guinean people believe in their own strength and the right to build their lives. Guinea, like other countries, hopes to solve the problem of safeguarding peace, and is unwilling to become a tool of the enemies of the people—the imperialists who hinder the development of oppressed nations.

　　Touré said, we hold high the banner of freedom and fear nothing. Our loyalty is unwavering. It enables us to overcome all the obstacles that imperialism has placed in our path.

    伏罗希洛夫欢宴杜尔总统
    新华社莫斯科21日电　据塔斯社莫斯科20日讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫在克里姆林宫设宴招待几内亚共和国总统杜尔和他的随行人员。
    伏罗希洛夫在宴会上致词说，苏联人民和苏联政府深深理解几内亚人民为巩固本国的独立，为发展国民经济和文化所作的努力。
    伏罗希洛夫说，对还没有获得民族独立的非洲各国人民来说，几内亚共和国是一个令人鼓舞的榜样。伏罗希洛夫表示相信塞古·杜尔这次访问苏联将为几内亚和苏联两国人民的合作开辟更广阔的前景。
    塞古·杜尔致答词说，几内亚人民相信自己的力量和建设生活的权利。几内亚和其他国家一样希望解决保障和平的问题，而不愿成为人民的敌人——阻挠被压迫民族发展的帝国主义者——的工具。
    杜尔说，我们高举起自由的旗帜，什么也不畏惧。我们的忠实是不可动摇的。它使我们能克服帝国主义布在我们道路上的一切障碍。
