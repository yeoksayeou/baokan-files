Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 7th: Under the slogan "Plant one plot, manage one plot well," Hunan is enthusiastically carrying out a winter crop bumper harvest competition. According to incomplete statistics from twenty counties alone, more than 790,000 cadres and people have established more than 1,250,000 mu of high-yield fields and plots. Before the winter planting, the CPC Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Committee stipulated that every cadre in charge of agricultural production, from the prefectural committee to the commune and production team, should have a high-yield plot so that the entire prefecture could be linked into a high-yield network. Now, more than 260,000 cadres and people across the prefecture have cultivated more than 600,000 mu of high-yield fields and plots, with high-yield field area accounting for half of the prefecture's total winter crop area.

This year, Hunan Province's winter planting work started early, was sown quickly, and had good quality. By the end of October, the province had sown more than 31 million mu of winter crops, an expansion of more than 3 million mu compared to the original plan. Among them, the rape sowing area exceeded the original plan by 300,000 mu. Green manure planting reached 18,620,000 mu, also exceeding the original plan by more than 3,600,000 mu. It is estimated that next year the province will have an average of one mu of green manure for every two mu of fields. Winter grain crops reached 9 million mu.

In late October, the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee instructed all localities to overcome drought through anti-Rightist struggles and boosting morale, to thoroughly break the "low-yield theory" of winter crops, and to rapidly launch a winter crop bumper harvest competition throughout the province. All localities immediately took action. All communes in the Chen County Special Zone universally established a winter crop field management production responsibility system and formed more than 20,000 specialized teams (groups) to be solely responsible for cultivating winter crops. More than one million mu of winter crops in the entire district were universally cultivated and topdressed more than once, generally with more than ten dan of quick-acting fertilizer applied per mu. According to an inspection of more than 1.7 million mu of rape in thirty-one counties in the three special zones of Changde, Shaoyang, and Qianyang, 60% are currently growing well, with seedlings generally already two or three cun high.

Currently, all localities in the province are universally carrying out large-scale inspections, appraisals, and flag-raisings of winter crops, and vigorously conducting appraisal and competition activities in order to push the winter crop bumper harvest competition to a new climax.

    种上一丘　管好一丘
    湖南开展冬种丰产竞赛
    据新华社长沙7日电　在“种一丘，管好一丘”的口号下，湖南各地热火朝天地开展冬季作物丰产竞赛运动。目前仅据二十个县的不完全统计，已有七十九万多名干部和群众建立了一百二十五万多亩丰产田和丰产片。中共湘西土家族苗族自治州地委在冬播之前规定：从地委直到公社和生产队，每个领导农业生产的干部都要有丰产片，以便全州联成一个丰产网。现在，全州已有二十六万多名干部和群众，搞了六十多万亩丰产田和丰产片，丰产田面积占全州冬种作物总面积的一半。
    今年湖南省冬种工作抓得早、播种快、质量好。到10月底止，全省已播种冬季作物三千一百多万亩，较原计划扩大三百多万亩。其中油菜播种面积超额三十万亩完成了原订计划。绿肥播种一千八百六十二万亩，也超过原计划三百六十多万亩，预计明年全省平均两亩多田可有一亩绿肥。冬种粮食作物达到九百万亩。
    中共湖南省委在10月下旬就指示各地通过反右倾、鼓干劲，战胜干旱，大破冬季作物“低产论”，迅速在全省范围内开展一个冬季作物的丰产竞赛运动。各地立即行动起来。郴县专区各公社普遍建立冬季作物田间管理生产责任制，成立两万多个专业队（组），专门负责培育冬季作物，全区一百多万亩冬季作物普遍中耕追肥一次以上，一般每亩追速效性肥料十多担。据常德、邵阳、黔阳等三个专区三十一个县检查一百七十多万亩油菜，目前有60％生长良好，一般苗已高两、三寸了。
    现在全省各地普遍开展冬季作物田间大检查、大评比，大插红旗，大搞评比竞赛运动，以便把冬季作物丰产竞赛运动推向新的高潮。
