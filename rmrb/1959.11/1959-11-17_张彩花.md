    Zhang Caihua

    I know Zhang Caihua; it was early in 1958.
    Just after moving into the production team of the agricultural cooperative, I heard Zhang Caihua's name. Everyone said she was a great worker, and few men could keep up with her. I wanted to get to know her, but I couldn't find the opportunity for a while.
    One day, the team assigned me to weed the wheat field. Six women went with me, one of whom looked the youngest and had decent features but was the least tidy. Her disheveled hair was twisted and knotted; her clothes were also dirty. There wasn't a single patch, but her chest had large patches of black, yellow, and brown. Alas, why doesn't this girl tidy herself up!
    We started working. Everyone lined up and weeded the field from north to south. Soon, this dirty girl was ahead of everyone else, and the ground she had weeded was so clean that not a single weed could be found. Alas! What a pity for the girl. If she could tidy herself up like she tidied the wheat field, how great it would be!
    When it came to evaluating work points, the female team leader respectfully called her name. It turned out she was Zhang Caihua.
    After the work points were assessed, everyone carried their hoes home. To talk to her, I wanted to walk alongside her, but I found that I could never catch up with her. The way she hurried home was as if her house was on fire.
    Finally, I arrived at her house. As soon as I entered, I found three children of about the same age sitting on the ground crying. So she was already the mother of three children.
    Before I knew her, I felt like I had never seen her before; once I knew her, I ran into her often. Meetings were often held in the evenings, and she attended every time, but she always brought one child in her arms and another one tugging at her, and sometimes she simply brought all three children to attend. As the opportunities to meet increased, we quickly became acquainted. It turned out that this mother of three was only twenty-two years old. She had married early, had children in quick succession, and lacked the care of older people at home. On top of that, she was meticulously engaged in production. Zhang Caihua completely forgot about herself and became a slovenly wife!
    Her husband was a carpenter who left early and returned late, and sometimes he was away for several days working. The couple had a good relationship. Once when I went to her house, I saw them washing clothes together in a wooden basin—a large pile of clothes that they both seemed to think had to be washed.
    Zhang Caihua's life—her working life and her marital life—was fulfilling. But from the appearance of her and her family, from the messy scene inside her house, her life could also be said to be unfulfilling.
    Later, I left that place.
    I often thought of her. Whenever I thought of her, I felt sympathy for her and regretted her situation.
    August 3, 1959, the first day I came back here. Many old friends came to my house to chat at night. After nine o'clock in the evening, people said goodbye and left. I was about to go to bed when suddenly a woman's clear voice rang out outside the window:
    "Old Shi, are you still awake?"
    Zhang Caihua!
    I quickly opened the door.
    Oh! My goodness! Could this really be Zhang Caihua?
    She was dressed very simply: two smooth braids were combed. She wore a white broadcloth shirt with small blue flowers on the upper body, with a round collar, revealing half of her neck. The trousers were made of linen, beige in color. I knew that trousers made of this material were very cool to wear in the summer, but they would wrinkle as soon as you wore them. But Zhang Caihua wore them today and they were straight and stiff. Her feet were in white socks and square-toed black cloth shoes. Simple, very simple, but radiant. Originally, Zhang Caihua was a pearl, only covered with a layer of dust, once wiped, would naturally shine.
    Zhang Caihua had changed!
    What was going on? Where was the secret of all this?
    Very simple. The three children were sent to the commune's nursery. After taking them back in the evening, she only had to do two things: play with them; coax them to sleep. This evening she was my last guest, just because coaxing the children to sleep delayed her visit. No longer did she have to be entangled with pots and stoves for three meals, everything was handled by the canteen. Now, in addition to productive labor, Zhang Caihua had free time to tidy up the house and tidy up herself.
    The people's commune awakened the desire for beauty in the depths of Zhang Caihua's heart. This desire is human, especially the instinct of half of humanity—women.
    That evening, Zhang Caihua and I talked for a long time, and we talked very enthusiastically, which attracted the comrades in the adjacent room.
    I told Zhang Caihua that some people said that the people's commune treated people like slaves.
    Before Zhang Caihua could speak, someone rushed to say:
    "You call this a slave? So beautiful, so happy!" He pointed to Zhang Caihua.
    Zhang Caihua smiled shyly under the gaze of everyone, smiling very charmingly. In the past, Zhang Caihua was too busy to even have time to smile.

    张彩花

    我认得张彩花，是1958年年初的事。
    刚到农业合作社的生产队里住下来，就听说张彩花的名字，都说她是劳动的好手，男子汉也很少能赶得上她的。想认识认识她，一时总找不到机会。
    有一天队里分配我去麦地锄草，和我一起去的六个人都是妇女，其中一个姑娘，看样子最年轻，长得也很端正，但却最不整洁。披散着的头发，都拧在一起，打成结了；衣服也很脏。一点儿补绽也没有，可是胸前黑的、黄的、褐的一大片。唉，这姑娘为什么不好好收拾一下呢！
    干活了。大家排成一行，从北向南锄着地里的杂草。很快地，这个脏姑娘就走在大家前面，而她锄过的地干净得一根杂草都找不到。唉！多可惜的姑娘。要是她能像收拾麦地一样收拾收拾她自己，该有多好！
    评工分的时候，领队的妇女恭恭敬敬地叫了她的名字，原来她就是张彩花。
    评罢工分，大家便荷锄回家了。为了跟她谈谈，我想和她并肩走，可是我发现我总是赶不上她。她急急忙忙往回走的那个劲儿呀，就像家里着了火一样。
    好不容易到她家了。一进门，发现三个差不多大的小孩都坐在地上哭。这么说她已经是三个孩子的妈妈了。
    不认识她，就觉得从来没见过她；既认得她，便常常碰到她。晚上常开会，每一次开会，她都出席，不过总是抱一个拉一个地来，有时干脆三个孩子都一起带来列席。见面的机会多了，很快地熟起来。原来这位三个孩子的妈妈才二十二岁，结婚结得早，孩子生得密，家里又缺少老年人照顾，加上她自己又是一丝不苟地搞生产，张彩花根本就忘了自己，使自己成了个躐蹋老婆了！
    她的丈夫是个木匠，早出晚归，有时外出干活，一连几天不回家。两口子感情很好。有一次我到她家里，就看到他们两口子一块儿用一个木盆洗衣服——一大堆衣服，看样子是他们都觉得非洗不可了。
    张彩花的生活——劳动生活和夫妻的感情生活——是美满的。可是从她以及她一家人的外表看，从她住屋里的那种乱七八糟的场面看，她的生活也可以说是不美满的。
    以后我就离开了那个地方。
    我常常想起她。一想起她，我就同情她，又为她感到可惜。
    1959年8月3日，也就是我重新来到这里的第一天。夜里很多老朋友都到我屋里聊天来了。晚上九点多钟，人们都告辞走了，我正准备睡觉，忽然窗外响起一个妇女的清脆的声音：
    “老石同志，还没睡呀？”
    张彩花！
    我连忙把门打开。
    哎呀！我的天！这可真的是张彩花？
    她打扮得非常朴素：梳两根光溜溜的辫子。上身穿一件府绸的白底小蓝花的衬衫，圆领，露出半截颈脖。裤子是亚麻布的，米黄色的。我知道这种布料的裤子夏天穿很风凉，但一穿就绉起来。可是张彩花今天穿起来，却是笔挺的。脚下是白袜和方口黑布鞋。朴素，非常朴素，但光彩夺目。本来麻，张彩花就是一颗珍珠，只不过蒙上了一层灰尘，一经拂拭，自然光华照人。
    张彩花变了！
    这是怎么回事？这一切的秘密在哪儿呢？
    很简单。三个孩子送进公社的托儿所了。晚上领回来以后，她只要做两件事：陪他们玩；哄他们睡觉。这一晚她是我的最后一个客人，就为的是哄孩子睡觉拖延了她的光临。再也不必为三顿饭而和锅灶缠个不休了，一切有食堂。现在，除了生产劳动以外，张彩花有空闲时间来收拾屋子，来收拾她自己了。
    人民公社在张彩花的心灵深处唤醒了对于美的要求，这种要求是人类的，特别是人类中的半数——妇女的本能。
    这一晚上我和张彩花谈了很久很久，而且谈得非常热烈，因而把左近隔室的同志们都吸引过来了。
    我告诉张彩花有人说人民公社把人当作奴隶使唤了。
    张彩花还来不及开口，就有人抢着说：
    “这也叫奴隶？这样漂亮，这样幸福！”他指着张彩花。
    张彩花在众人的目光下羞涩地笑了一下，笑得非常迷人。过去，张彩花忙得连笑的功夫都没有。
