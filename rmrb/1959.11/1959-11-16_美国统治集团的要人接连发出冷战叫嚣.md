    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 15th: Representatives of the American ruling clique have recently been continuously publishing statements defending the "Cold War" and opposing the relaxation of international tensions.
    Vice President Nixon, in a speech at Lawrence University in Wisconsin on the 13th, once again provocatively advocated using so-called "evolution" to give the Eastern European socialist countries so-called "freedom." He clamored that "Western countries cannot accept what the Soviets call peaceful coexistence." On the same day, at a press conference in Indianapolis, Indiana, Nixon also clamored against restoring China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, slandering China as "not a peace-loving country." Not long ago, Nixon also delivered a speech at the University of Los Angeles defending the "Cold War." He tried his best to provoke relations between Asian and African countries and the Soviet Union and China, and declared that the United States has a responsibility to "ensure" that Asian and African countries do not lose their "freedom."
    Another figure in the ruling group of the United States, oil tycoon and New York Governor Rockefeller, in his first speech on American foreign policy in New York not long ago, opposed the West increasing trade with the Soviet Union. He demanded that trade with the Soviet Union be conducted only according to the methods stipulated by Wall Street, and suggested that aggressive military groups such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization "monitor" trade with the Soviet Union. Rockefeller also recently advocated that the United States unilaterally resume nuclear weapons testing, regardless of the opposition of the people of the world.
    Former US President Truman also published an article in the "New York Times" on November 8, actively advocating that the United States resume nuclear weapons testing. He believes that continuing to suspend nuclear weapons testing is meaningless. He clamored: "We should abandon this idea immediately." A close colleague of Truman's, former Secretary of State Acheson, recently proposed a plan to expand the North Atlantic aggressive group, attempting to draw more countries into the Cold War, and advocated launching a "political maneuver war" against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

    美国统治集团的要人接连发出冷战叫嚣
    新华社15日讯　纽约消息：美国统治集团里的一些代表人物最近不断发表维护“冷战”和敌视国际紧张局势缓和的言论。
    副总统尼克松13日在威斯康星州劳伦斯大学发表演说时又一次挑衅性地鼓吹用所谓“演变”的办法给东欧社会主义国家以所谓“自由”。他叫嚣说，“西方国家不能接受苏联人所谓的和平共处”。尼克松同一天在印第安纳州波里斯的一次记者招待会上还叫嚷反对恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位，他诬蔑中国“不是爱好和平的国家”。不久前尼克松在洛杉矶大学也发表了一篇维护“冷战”的演说，他竭力挑拨亚非国家同苏联和中国的关系，并且宣称美国有责任“保证”亚非国家不失去它们的“自由”。
    美国统治集团当权派的另一个人物、石油大王兼纽约州州长洛克菲勒不久前在纽约就美国外交政策发表的第一次演说中，反对西方增加同苏联的贸易。他要求只根据华尔街规定的办法来同苏联进行贸易，并且建议由北大西洋公约组织和东南亚条约组织这类侵略性军事集团来“监视”对苏联的贸易。洛克菲勒不久前还主张美国不顾世界人民的反对单方面恢复核武器试验。
    美国前总统杜鲁门11月8日也在“纽约时报”上发表文章，积极鼓吹美国恢复核武器试验。他认为继续停止核武器试验没有什么意义。他叫嚣说：“我们应该立即放弃这种想法。”杜鲁门的一个亲密同僚、前国务卿艾奇逊不久前提出了扩大北大西洋侵略集团的计划，企图把更多的国家拉入冷战，并且鼓吹对苏联和其他社会主义国家展开“政治机动战”。
