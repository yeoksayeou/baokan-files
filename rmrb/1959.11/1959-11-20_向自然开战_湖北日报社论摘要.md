War Against Nature
--Excerpts from Hubei Daily Editorial

The Hubei Daily published an editorial on November 15th entitled "War Against Nature" in recognition of the great achievements of Yun County in managing mountains, water, and soil. Excerpts are as follows:

To change the face of the countryside, we must wage war against nature!

Natural disasters are a major enemy facing us. It's either people obeying nature's dictates: floods becoming torrents, inundating everything, crops submerged, people forced to flee; droughts becoming disasters, crops withering, people starving. People become slaves to nature. Or it's people conquering nature: undertaking large-scale water conservancy, controlling water, turning water hazards into water benefits, making water, soil, and mountains obey people. People become masters of nature. Since ancient times, mankind has been fighting nature, and without struggle, there can be no survival. However, in the old society, the oppressed peasant masses did not (and could not) break the superstition about nature, and had no power to fight nature, so they had to obey the will of heaven. In years of favorable weather, they harvested a little more and ate a little more; in years of floods and droughts, crops failed, and they could only starve, flee famine, and families were destroyed. Now, the peasant masses have been liberated from the oppression of the old social system. Under the new socialist system, and under the correct leadership of the Party, they have gradually broken superstitions, gradually understood the laws of nature, and gradually mastered the knowledge of fighting nature. Especially after the people's communes, the highly organized peasant masses have the full power to gradually conquer nature and get rid of the oppression of natural disasters. If we want to survive better, if we want to advance at high speed, if we want to build a new socialist countryside, we must wage war against nature, we must conquer nature.

Now, in many areas, a large-scale mass movement to conquer nature has been launched vigorously. Some areas, where the peasant masses have long been enslaved by nature, have begun to tame nature and become masters of nature. For example, in the Dayan Commune of Yun County in the Xiangyang Special District, the Zhaogang Commune of Guanghua, the Xijiadian Commune of Jun County, and the Taiping Commune of Zao Yang, these places have begun to fundamentally manage water, mountains, and soil, and to fundamentally change the face of the countryside. The Construction Management Area of the Dayan Commune in Yun County, after two or three years of effort, has dug more than a hundred reservoirs on the high mountains, built six large canals and ninety-six winding mountain branch canals, and increased terraced fields from more than one thousand mu in the past to more than ten thousand mu. The poor and desolate scene of "water becoming floods, and going away as drought," and "slopes being eroded into bare rock slabs, and ditches being silted into messy rock beaches" is gone forever. The appearance of the Construction Management Area has greatly changed. Of course, this is not enough, they are still vigorously reforming and continuing to change. Facts tell us: man can conquer nature, man can conquer nature.

To transform nature and build a new countryside, we must have great enthusiasm and heroic aspirations. To transform nature according to our ideals, to build the poor and backward countryside into a paradise of "green mountains and clear waters, a colorful world, abundant food and clothing, peach-blossom faces, steel horses galloping, and lights as bright as day," this is an arduous and complex task. How to build mountainous areas? How to build hilly areas? How to build plains? How to manage water? How to manage mountains? How to manage soil? How to manage production? How to build villages? How to develop transportation? What should be achieved this year and next year? What should be achieved in the next five, ten, or fifteen years? Such a great matter, without great enthusiasm, magnificent minds, heroic aspirations, without an open vision, long-term plans, a determination for long-term construction, without the spirit of fearlessness, hard work, and never stopping until the goal is achieved, but only with a narrow vision, piecemeal efforts, working one day at a time, and taking one step at a time, can never be accomplished. Therefore, every county, every commune, every management area, and every production team should formulate a grand plan to manage water, manage mountains, manage soil, and change the face of nature.

To transform nature and change the face of the countryside, we must look at the long term and do it from nearby. We must plan for the long term, think about the next five, ten, or fifteen years, and have a long-term goal. But, more importantly, we must start doing it today, sooner is always better than later. Five, ten, or fifteen years should be counted day by day, and worked day by day. If we encounter any difficulties or setbacks, we must not waver or retreat, we must be persistent, and great success can be achieved through accumulation.

Transforming nature is a matter for millions of people, and the power and wisdom of the masses must be fully utilized. The Construction Management Area planned to open a winding mountain canal as early as when it was running an advanced cooperative. It was initially handed over to technicians for surveying, and according to the technician's design, it required 30,000 to 40,000 workdays, 10,000 catties of lime, 1,000 catties of explosives, and many years. The conclusion was: this great project is difficult to handle. Later, this matter was handed over to the masses for discussion, and the masses exploded, they said: we will do it ourselves. Thus, carpenters did the surveying, hunters prepared the explosives, lime was burned by themselves, and iron crowbars were made by themselves. As a result, the fifteen-mile winding mountain canal was completed in only eight days. Without relying on the masses, there are many difficulties; relying on the masses, it is easy to handle, and nothing is difficult.

It should be repeated: In order to change the face of the countryside, for a bright tomorrow, we must have great enthusiasm and heroic aspirations, and we must combine them with a scientific spirit of seeking truth, and bravely wage war against nature! We want to conquer nature, be the masters of nature, and make water, mountains, soil, and all of nature obey us and benefit us.

### 向自然开战——湖北日报社论摘要

    向自然开战
    ——湖北日报社论摘要
    11月15日湖北日报，为郧县治山、治水、治土取得巨大成就发表题为“向自然开战”的社论。摘要如下：
    改变农村面貌，必须向自然开战！
    自然灾害是摆在我们面前的大敌。要不就是人听从自然摆布：大水成洪，到处泛滥，庄稼淹没，人被逼走；大旱成灾，庄稼干死，人饿肚子。人，成为自然的奴隶。要不就是人去征服自然：大兴水利，把水治住，变水患为水利，使水、土、山听从于人。人，成为自然的主宰。自古以来，人类一直和自然作斗争，无斗争就不能生存。但是，在旧社会，受压迫的农民群众，没有（也不可能）破除对自然的迷信，没有力量和自然作斗争，因而只好听从老天爷的摆布。风调雨顺之年，多收一点，多吃一点；水旱灾害之年，庄稼歉收，只有饿肚皮，只有逃荒，家破人亡。现在，农民群众已经从旧社会制度压迫下解放出来，在新的社会主义制度下，在党的正确领导下，他们逐步破除了迷信，逐步认识了自然的规律，逐步掌握了同自然斗争的知识。尤其是人民公社化以后，高度组织起来的农民群众，完全有力量去逐步征服自然，摆脱天灾的压迫。我们要更好地生存下去，要高速度地前进，要建设社会主义的新农村，我们一定要向自然开战，要征服自然。
    现在，在许多地区，大规模地征服自然的群众运动已经轰轰烈烈、蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来了。有些地区过去一直受自然奴役的农民群众，已经开始驯服了自然，变成自然的主宰者。比如在襄阳专区郧县的大堰公社，光化的赵岗公社，均县的习家店公社，枣阳的太平公社，这些地方已经开始从根本上进行治水、治山和治土、治路，从根本上去改变农村的面貌。郧县大堰公社的建设管理区，经过两三年的努力，在高山上挖了一百多个堰塘，修了六条大水渠和九十六条盘山支渠，梯田梯地由过去的一千多亩增加到一万多亩。过去那种“水来成洪，水去成旱”，那种“坡地冲成光石板，沟地淤成乱石滩”的穷困凄凉的景象，已经一去不复返。建设管理区的面貌，已经有很大的改变。当然这还不够，他们还在大力地改，继续地变。事实告诉我们：人能胜天，人可以征服自然。
    改造自然，建设新农村，要有高度的热情和豪壮的志气。要按照我们的理想去改造自然，要把贫穷落后的农村建设成为“青山绿水，花花世界，丰衣足食，人面桃花，钢马奔驰，灯光如昼”的乐园，这是一个艰巨而复杂的任务。山区怎么建设？岗地怎么建设？平原怎么建设？水怎么治？山怎么治？土怎么治？生产怎么经营？村庄怎么建设？交通怎么发展？今年、明年要达到什么样子？今后五年、十年、十五年要达到什么样子？这样天大的事情，如果没有高度的热情，雄伟的心胸，豪壮的志气，没有开拓的眼界、长远的计划、长期建设的决心，没有无所畏惧、艰苦奋斗、不达目的不止的精神，而只是鼠目寸光，零敲碎打，干一天算一天，走一步算一步，无论如何是办不成的。因此，每一个县、一个公社、一个管理区、一个生产队，都应当制定一个宏伟的治水、治山、治土、改变自然面貌的规划。
    改造自然，改变农村面貌，既要从远处看，又要从近处做。要长远打算，要想到今后五年、十年、十五年的事情，要有一个远大的奋斗目标。但是，更重要的是要从今天就开始做，早一天总比晚一天好。五年、十年、十五年的时间，应当一天天的算，一天天的干，遇到任何困难挫折，都不能动摇退缩，百折不挠，日积月累，大功才能告成。
    改造自然，是千百万群众的事，必须充分发挥群众的力量和智慧。建设管理区早在办高级社的时候，就计划开盘山长渠。开始交给技术员去勘测，按照技术员的设计，又是要三、四万工，又是要万斤石灰、千斤炸药，又是要多少年月。结论是：这末大的工程难办。后来，将这件事情交给群众讨论，群众就轰开了，他们说：我们自己干。于是，木匠搞测量，猎人配炸药，石灰自己烧，铁橇自己造。结果，十五里的盘山大渠只八天就修成了。不依靠群众，就是困难重重；依靠了群众，就这好办，那也不难。
    应该重复一遍：为了改变农村面貌，为了美好的明天，要拿出高度的热情和豪壮的志气，并且要和科学的求实精神相结合，勇敢地向自然开战！我们要征服自然，做自然的主人，使水、山、土以及大自然的一切，都听人们使唤，为人们造福。
