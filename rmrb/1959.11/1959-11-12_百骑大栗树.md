    The Hundred Horse Chestnut Tree
    On Mount Etna in Sicily, in the Mediterranean, there is a chestnut tree. Legend has it that Queen Joanna of Aragon once led a hundred horsemen to visit. Suddenly, a rainstorm came, and thanks to the shelter of this chestnut tree, all the horsemen were kept dry. Since then, it has been called the "Hundred Horse Chestnut Tree."
    The trunk of the "Hundred Horse Chestnut Tree" is about fifty meters in circumference. It would take at least thirty people to encircle it. There is a crack under the tree large enough for two horses to pass side by side. Chestnut pickers often use it as a temporary dormitory and warehouse.

    百骑大栗树
    地中海西西里岛的爱特那火山上有一株栗树，相传古代阿拉刚国王后雅妮有一次带领一百骑人马前去游览，忽然暴风雨来了，由于这株栗树的掩蔽，全部人马都没有被淋湿，从此它便得到了“百骑大栗树”的名称。
    “百骑大栗树”的树干周围约五十米，要把它围抱起来，至少需三十人。树下有一裂口，可容两马并行，采栗的人，常常把它当作临时的宿舍和栈房来使用。
