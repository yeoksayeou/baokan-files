    Joining Hands to Strive for High Speed
    One month ago today, we reported: "One hundred thousand young workers are entering 1960 at high speed"; now, we declare: the army of young workers entering 1960 is already a mighty force of one million two hundred and thirty thousand people! We sing the praises of this soul-stirring high speed, we sing the praises of this inspiring "large-scale harvest!"
    The purpose of socialist labor emulation is to transform the level of a few advanced individuals into the production level of the entire society through "learning, comparing, catching up, and helping," and to realize a "large-scale harvest" for the entire society. The slogan of the young workers of the Shanghai Tool Factory is well put: "In the high-speed march into 1960, we will not let a single comrade fall behind!" What a spirited slogan!
    All those who are running ahead of time should learn the communist spirit of the young workers of the Shanghai Tool Factory, extend a warm hand to those who have difficulty completing their plans ahead of schedule, and the ranks of those entering 1960 ahead of schedule will expand more quickly, and the pace of production and construction will advance more quickly.

    携手齐争高速度
    一个月前的今天，我们报道：“十万青工高速度跨进1960年”；现在，我们宣告：跨进1960年的青工已是一百二十三万人的浩浩荡荡的队伍！我们歌颂这种动人心弦的高速度，我们歌颂这种振奋人心的“大面积丰收！”
    社会主义劳动竞赛的目的，就是要通过“学、比、赶、帮”，把少数先进者的水平变成全社会的生产水平，实现全社会的“大面积丰收”。上海工具厂青工们的口号提得好：“在高速度跨进1960年的急行军中，不让一个伙伴掉队！”这是多么有气魄的口号！
    所有跑在时间前面的人都学习上海工具厂青工的共产主义思想，向提前完成计划有困难的人伸出热情的手，提前跨进1960年的队伍就能更快地扩大，生产建设的步伐就会更快地前进。
