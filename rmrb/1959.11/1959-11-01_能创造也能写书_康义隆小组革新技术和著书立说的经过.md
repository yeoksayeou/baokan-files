    Able to Create and Able to Write Books
    —The Technical Innovation and Book Writing Process of the Kang Yilong Group
    The Kang Yilong Oxidation Group of the Shaanxi State-owned Huashan Machinery Factory was established in December 1957. Thanks to the Party's cultivation and education, this group not only completed or exceeded production tasks every month, but also innovated more than 70 technologies, saving a large amount of wealth for the country. Since last year, the Kang Yilong Group has been successively rated as a technical innovation pacesetter in Xi'an, a representative of municipal, provincial, and national youth socialist construction activists, and a representative of provincial advanced producers, and has received awards from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. At present, this group has become a famous red flag group in Shaanxi and a benchmark for the majority of employees to catch up with.
    Sweeping Away Rightist Tendencies
    Under the guidance of the Party, the Kang Yilong Group has waged unremitting struggles against various right-leaning and conservative thoughts. During the factory's construction, the Kang Yilong Group carefully studied the factory's design drawings and actively suggested canceling or reducing unnecessary equipment. For example, the tank for pickling parts was designed to be made of stainless steel, requiring more than 1,000 yuan. They felt that a ceramic basin could be used instead. However, the chief engineer disagreed, saying, "The factory has a high degree of mechanization; it would be unsightly to put a ceramic basin!" What kind of reason is this? To waste construction funds for the sake of appearance? No, they continued to put forward opinions and fought against the wrong opinions. Coincidentally, there was a shortage of raw materials at that time, and the production urgently needed to use them, so the engineer's opinion was rejected by the leadership, and their suggestion was adopted. A ceramic basin purchased for three yuan is still in use today. In addition, they also suggested canceling the drying motor, four flow material tanks, four roller conveyors, and eight electric hoists from the drawings, saving the country nearly 30,000 yuan.
    During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Party issued a great call for technical innovation and technical revolution, and the Kang Yilong Group immediately responded positively. The Party taught them that the spearhead of technical innovation should be directed at the key to production. The key to production in front of them was the lack of resistance wire required for heat oxidation treatment, which affected the completion of production tasks. This heat oxidation was carried out at a temperature of about 150 degrees Celsius. The irritating smell of the evaporating rust inhibitor made people dizzy; it was also easy to cause burns and scalds during operation, and the power consumption was also very high. When Kang Yilong and foreman Li Wenbin were studying in the Soviet Union, they heard from their teachers that the Soviet Union was studying new methods to replace heat oxidation. From that time on, they had the idea of ​​innovating heat oxidation. Once, technician Wang Xingwu saw a short paragraph introducing "cold oxidation" in a Soviet magazine. There were only five or six sentences in the text, explaining the composition of cold oxidation. Based on this information, Kang Yilong, together with foreman Li Wenbin, technician Wang Xingwu, and worker Wang Zhenhuai, began the experiment of cold oxidation. After more than 20 days of experimentation, little progress was made. The surface of the oxidized product was not smooth, and the color was not bright, which did not meet the requirements. What particularly annoyed them was that they could not find the reason for the failure. As a result, some people in the group were discouraged and said, "That's the business of the Academy of Sciences; how can we workers do it!" Some engineering and technical personnel laughed at them and ridiculed them.
    After the Party Committee Secretary and the factory director learned about their innovation, they immediately held a meeting in the workshop, approved their experimental project on the spot, and instructed all units to vigorously support them. The Party's support and encouragement, like a raging fire, further ignited their enthusiasm for innovation and creation, and they were determined to fight to the end with the spirit of revolution. At that time, there was too little information, and their knowledge and experience were insufficient, so they were determined to learn. They ran all over the bookstores in the city, consulted several university professors, and visited some chemical factories. What they learned from books, what the professors said, and what they actually saw, although they did not unlock the mystery of cold oxidation, increased their knowledge and courage.
    In order to help the Kang Yilong Group conduct experiments, the Party also invited an engineer from Sichuan. At first, this engineer was very confident in the cold oxidation experiment and actively helped them. However, failure followed failure, and blow after blow. Because he could not see the hope of victory in failure, this engineer lost confidence. However, all the comrades in the Kang Yilong Group were not discouraged and still worked with full enthusiasm, conducting experiments according to their own plan. In one experiment, it was suddenly discovered that the quality of a part was very good, and they looked for the reason and found that it had not been pickled. The quality was indeed very good after the pickling was canceled for the experiment. In this way, after 40 days of hard work and more than 200 failures, they finally basically succeeded in the cold oxidation experiment. This creation increased work efficiency by three times, saving the country 160,000 yuan per year, and greatly improved labor conditions and ensured safe production.
    Writing Books and Making Speeches
    After the success of the Kang Yilong Group's "cold oxidation" experiment, although it played a great role in production, it could not be explained theoretically. When they asked others, they didn't understand either. In addition, there were many new workers in the group at that time, and their technical level was very low. In order to facilitate the new workers to learn the technology, they wanted to summarize the "cold oxidation" and write a book. However, they felt that their cultural level was low and they always dared not start writing. Later, after seeing the deeds of workers in Tianjin, Wuxi, and other places writing books and making speeches, they also plucked up their courage.
    At first, they had a wrong idea: writing a book means writing a thick one, with unfathomable terms and very complicated chemical reaction formulas inside. They found a lot of reference books and planned to write fifteen chapters, which were divided into sections and written by five people. They couldn't continue writing as they wrote, and they felt that the writing in the book was very fluent, so they couldn't help but copy the book. The more they copied, the longer it became, and they didn't understand what they were writing at all. A month passed, and they finally finished writing, but after everyone's review, there was not even a shadow of their own production experience. Some said it was good, some said it was bad, and they couldn't reach a consensus. They reported these situations to the Party branch. The Party branch told them: "Books are a summary of human class struggle and the experience of fighting against nature, and they are created by the working people. Laborers can not only create, but also summarize them and write them into books, and they can write well. If this is the case, why do you want to copy others? Isn't it better to write about your own experience? Writing about your familiar production practice is not only beneficial to others and yourself, but also will be written quickly and well!" According to the instructions of the Party, they launched a debate; after the debate, their thoughts and directions were correct, their confidence was also greatly increased, and writing became quite smooth.
    After more than 20 nights of hard work, a book of more than 50,000 words, "Basic Knowledge of Oxidation Workers," was completed. After the appraisal by relevant units, it was considered that this book was a combination of politics and technology, and a book that combined theory with practice, which was of great benefit to oxidation workers. This book will be published soon. Now they are starting to write the second book - "Data on Pickling of Non-ferrous Metals."
    Fighting a War Against the "King of Acids"
    After being tempered by the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Kang Yilong Group entered 1959 with even greater vigor and wanted to emit more light and heat for the cause of socialist construction.
    However, at the beginning, several new workers were clamoring to transfer their jobs. What was the reason for this? The thing is this: after steel parts are heat-treated, there is a thick layer of oxide scale and impurities on the surface. To remove this layer of oxide scale and impurities, it is necessary to use nitric acid for strong pickling. Once nitric acid comes out of the jar, it first emits red smoke, which spreads throughout the workshop. Working in this red cloud and mist affects people's health. This is the reason why some apprentices requested to transfer their jobs.
    How to control the nitric acid fumes? There was no way. Could a gas-free pickling method be created? The Kang Yilong Group began to ponder.
    As in the previous innovation process, failure followed failure. From their previous innovation and creation, they knew that failure is the beginning of success and the prelude to victory. So this time they were not discouraged at all. They first mixed various acids to try, just without nitric acid. After trying and trying, there were various colors such as red, yellow, blue, white, and black, but none of them met the standard golden yellow.
    At this time, Party Branch Secretary Wang Buhua came again. This Secretary Wang, like a timely rain, always came when they were most difficult. He encouraged them to persevere, to experiment well, and to analyze scientifically. They looked for various materials to read, and carefully studied and searched for the reasons for failure, and conducted planned experiments. After more than 20 experiments, they finally found an ideal formula, and everyone was extremely happy. Although it was more than two o'clock in the night, they still didn't want to sleep. The next day, before dawn, Kang Yilong got up and ran to the factory. He wanted to give everyone a performance and make everyone happy. But after an experiment, yo! The parts changed their faces, no longer that beautiful golden yellow, as ugly as a child's diaper. Failed again. At night, they began to experiment again, trying and trying, but always failing, and they couldn't find the reason for the failure. Is there a problem with the temperature of the acid solution? Try raising the temperature. When the parts were placed in the acid solution with a higher temperature, they were golden and beautiful. They were very surprised! Rubbing their astringent eyes, looking at the beautiful parts, they were indeed successful. This creation can not only ensure the safety and health of workers, but also reduce two processes, saving 30 tons of nitric acid a year. Those who were not at ease with their work were at ease, and those who had slipped away from the pickling tank returned.
    Flowers Bloom Everywhere
    The Kang Yilong Group has made many innovations and creations, but not everyone has done enough. The master was busy, but the apprentices couldn't get involved. In order to launch a mass technical innovation movement in the group, they put forward a slogan: "Everyone has innovations, and there are improvements every month." But the apprentices said: "Even if you don't understand technology, can you still innovate and create? Can you run before you can walk?" In addition to the three technical workers Kang Yilong, Li Wenbin, and Wang Zhenhuai, everyone else in the group was an apprentice. How can a wave of innovation be launched if apprentices have this kind of thinking? They painstakingly explained to the apprentices the principle that low technology can also innovate technology, and gave some examples, but the apprentices did not believe it. This must be convinced with facts. Apprentice Zhou Bin had the least confidence in innovation and creation, so they wanted to help him innovate a technology to educate everyone. At that time, there was an urgent need for distilled water for production, but it could not be bought. They decided to help Zhou Bin manufacture a simple distiller. Zhou Bin was very reluctant when he accepted the task, and he went home after work. Kang Yilong and Wang Zhenhuai talked to him, and the answer was: "I have never even seen a distiller." "What are you afraid of if you haven't seen it? You'll see it when you make it!" They helped him find a gasoline barrel and a serpentine tube, and explained to him the manufacturing process and principle of distilled water. In this way, his confidence increased, his enthusiasm was full, and after repeated experiments, Zhou Bin's simple distiller was successfully trial-produced. The group put a glorious flower on Zhou Bin, praised him at the meeting, introduced his experience, and reported his transformation process. This was education for Zhou Bin and encouragement for everyone. The apprentices immediately launched an innovation competition craze to catch up with Zhou Bin. Apprentice Gao Yuxi actively studied and created a product sealing method, which could complete the entire month's task in three days. Now, everyone in the group has innovations and creations, some as many as five or six.
    One flower cannot make a beautiful spring. The Kang Yilong Group not only innovates itself, but also helps others innovate. It not only overfulfills its own production tasks, but also helps others complete their tasks. The rolling bearings made by the Fourth Work Zone of their workshop are very easy to rust. The grinding workers came to them to find a solution. At that time, their production was very busy, but they still squeezed out time to help enthusiastically, and finally formulated a rust-proof solution. The rusted balls were put in, and the rust disappeared in a short time. Only the bright and shiny balls were seen, which were dazzling. They not only revived 50,000 balls, but also revived more than 100 sets of bearings that had been scrapped in the warehouse, saving the country 100,000 yuan. In addition, the Kang Yilong Group also helped the inspection room successfully trial-produce Minghua treatment, which inspected cracks invisible to the naked eye, and also successfully trial-produced ball electro-polishing and adjusted grinding wheels for the workshop. The in-depth development of the technical innovation movement has greatly reduced the labor intensity and greatly improved production efficiency. Six people can complete the tasks of more than 30 people in the whole group. Now, the Kang Yilong Group has established a communist cooperation team. Wherever there is difficulty, they go there; whoever needs help, they go to help.

    能创造也能写书
    ——康义隆小组革新技术和著书立说的经过
    陕西省国营华山机械厂康义隆氧化小组是1957年12月成立的。由于党的培养教育，这个小组不仅月月完成或超额完成了生产任务，而且革新技术七十多项，为国家节约了大量财富。去年以来，康义隆小组先后被评为西安市技术革新标兵，市、省和全国青年社会主义建设积极分子代表和省先进生产者代表，并受到团中央的奖励。目前，这个小组已经成为陕西著名的红旗小组，成为广大职工追赶的标兵。
    横扫右倾
    康义隆小组在党的教导下曾同各种右倾保守思想进行过不懈的斗争。在工厂筹建的时候，康义隆小组认真地研究了工厂的设计图纸，对其中可有可无的设备，积极建议取消或削减。如酸洗零件用的槽子，根据图纸设计要用不锈钢制做，需要一千多元。他们觉得买一个陶瓷盆就可以代替。可是，主管工程师不同意，说：“工厂机械化程度很高，放一个陶瓷盆多难看！”这算什么理由呢？为了好看而让建设资金浪费掉？不能，他们又不断地提出意见，向错误的意见进行斗争。也巧，那时候原材料缺乏，生产又急需使用，工程师的意见被领导否定了，他们的建议被采纳了，花三元钱买的一个陶瓷盆直用到现在。此外，他们还建议从图纸上取消了烘干涤动机、四个流料槽、四条辊道和八个电葫芦，这几项为国家节约近三万元。
    在1958年的大跃进中，党发出技术革新和技术革命的伟大号召，康义隆小组立即积极响应。党教导他们技术革新的矛头，要对准生产关键。摆在他们面前的生产关键是热氧化处理所需要的电阻丝缺少，影响生产任务的完成。这种热氧化是在摄氏一百五十度左右的温度下进行操作的，防锈剂蒸发的气味呛得人头晕目眩；操作时还容易引起烧伤和烫伤事故，耗电量也很大。康义隆和工长李文斌在苏联学习的时候，曾听老师说，苏联正在研究用新的方法代替热氧化。从那时起，他们就有了革新热氧化的念头。有一次，技术员王醒吾在一本苏联杂志上看到了介绍“冷氧化”的一小段文章。文内只有五、六句话，说明冷氧化的成份。根据这一点资料，康义隆就和工长李文斌、技术员王醒吾、工人王振槐一起，开始了冷氧化的试验。经过二十多天的试验，进展不大，氧化出来的产品表面不光，颜色不亮，不合要求。特别使他们恼火的是找不到失败的原因。于是组内有人泄气了，说：“那是科学院的事，咱们工人哪能行！”有的工程技术人员笑话他们，讽刺他们。
    当党委书记和厂长知道他们革新的情况以后，立即在车间召开会议，当场批准了他们的试验项目，并指示各单位要大力支持他们。党的支持和鼓励，好像一把大火，更加燃起了他们革新创造的热情，他们决心以革命的精神同困难搏斗到底。那时候，资料太少，知识和经验也不足，他们就下决心学习。他们跑遍了全市的书店，又请教了几位大学教授，参观了一些化工厂。书上学的，教授讲的，实际看的，虽然没有打开冷氧化之谜，可是给他们增加了知识，增加了勇气。
    党为了帮助康义隆小组进行试验，又从四川请来一位工程师。这位工程师开初对试验冷氧化信心很高，积极帮助他们。可是，失败接着失败，打击连着打击，这位工程师因为在失败中看不到胜利的希望，丧失了信心。可是，康义隆小组的全体同志并不泄气，仍然干劲十足，按照自己的方案进行试验。在一次试验中，突然发现有一个零件质量很好，他们就找原因，发现是没有经过酸洗。取消酸洗进行试验，质量果然很好。就这样，经过四十天的努力，遭到了二百多次的失败，终于把冷氧化基本试验成功了。这项创造提高工效三倍，全年可以为国家节约十六万元，并且大大地改善了劳动条件，保证了安全生产。
    著书立说
    康义隆小组“冷氧化”试验成功后，虽然生产上起了很大作用，可是在理论上讲不清楚。请教别人，别人也不明白。加之，那时候这个小组新工人很多，技术水平很低。为了便于新工人学习技术，他们想把“冷氧化”总结一下，写成一本书。可是他们觉得文化水平低，老不敢动笔。后来看到天津、无锡等地工人著书立说的事迹，他们也鼓起了勇气。
    开初，他们有个错误的想法：写书嘛，就得写成厚厚一本，里边有高深莫测的名词，有非常复杂的化学反应公式。他们找来一大堆参考书，计划写十五章，五个人分段写。写着写着写不下去，又觉得书上写得很流利，笔不由己地抄起书来。越抄越长，究竟写了些什么，自己也不懂得。一个月过去了，总算写成了，可大家一审查，连自己生产经验的影子也没有。有人说好，有人说坏，争论不下。他们把这些情况向党支部汇报了。党支部对他们说：“书是人类阶级斗争和向自然斗争的经验总结，是劳动人民创造的。劳动者既能创造，就能总结起来写成书，而且能写好。既是这样，你们为什么要抄别人的。把自己的经验写出来，不是更好吗？写自己熟悉的生产实践，不但对人对己有益，而且会写得又快又好！”按照党的指示，他们展开辩论；经过辩论，思想和方向对头了，信心也大了，写起来也挺顺手了。
    经过二十多夜的苦战，一本五万多字的“氧化工基本知识”脱稿了。经过有关单位的鉴定，认为这本书是政治和技术相结合，理论联系实际的书，对氧化工有很大益处。这本书不久就要出版了。现在他们又在着手编写第二本书——“有色金属酸洗资料”。
    大战“酸中王”
    经过1958年大跃进的锻炼，进入1959年康义隆小组更加意气风发，要为社会主义建设事业发出更大的光和热。
    可是，开始也还有几个新工人闹着要调动工作。这是为什么呢？事情是这样：钢零件经过热处理以后，表面有很厚一层氧化皮和杂质。要取掉这层氧化皮和杂质，就得用硝酸进行强度酸洗。硝酸这东西，一出坛，先冒红烟，打散到全车间。在这赤云红雾中工作，对身体健康有影响。这就是有些徒工要求调动工作的原因。
    怎样把硝酸烟雾治住呢？没有办法。能不能创造个无气体酸洗的办法？康义隆小组开始琢磨起来。
    和以往革新过程一样，还是失败接着失败。从以往革新创造中他们知道，失败是成功的开始，是胜利的前奏。所以这次他们一点也不灰心。他们先把各种酸混起来试，只是不要硝酸。试来试去，红、黄、蓝、白、黑，各色都有，就是没有合乎标准的金黄色。
    这时候党总支书记王布华同志又来了。这位王书记，好像及时雨一样，老是在他们最困难的时候就来了。他鼓励他们坚持下去，要好好地试验，要科学分析。他们又找各种资料看，又仔细研究，找寻失败原因，进行有计划的试验。经过二十多次试验，他们终于找到了一个合乎理想的配方，大家高兴极了。虽然到了夜里两点多，可还不想睡觉。第二天，天没亮，康义隆就爬起来，往工厂跑。他想给大家表演，让大伙高兴高兴。可是一试验，哟！零件变脸了，不再是那样漂亮的金黄色，难看得跟小孩尿布一样。又失败了。夜里，他们又开始试验，试来试去总是失败，也找不出失败的原因。是不是酸溶液的温度有问题，提高温度试试看。零件往温度较高的酸溶液里一放，金黄金黄，漂亮极了。他们很惊讶！揉揉发涩的眼睛，看看漂亮的零件，确实是成功了。这次创造，不仅可以保证工人的安全和健康，又减少了两道工序，一年可以节约三十吨硝酸。不安心工作的安心了，从酸洗槽边溜走的人又回来了。
    鲜花处处开
    康义隆小组革新创造不少，可是大家动手不够。师傅忙得团团转，徒弟却插不上手。为了在小组里开展群众性的技术革新运动，他们提出个口号：“人人有革新，月月有改进”。可是徒工们说话了：“连技术也不懂，还能革新创造？不会走还能跑？”全组除了康义隆、李文斌、王振槐三个技术工人以外，其他都是徒工。徒工有这种思想，怎能掀起革新热潮呢？他们苦口婆心地给徒工讲技术低也能革新技术的道理，还举了些例子，可是徒工不相信。这得用事实说服大家。徒工周斌对革新创造最没信心，他们就想帮助他革新一次技术，教育大家。那时，生产急需蒸馏水，可是买不到。他们就决定帮助周斌制造简易蒸馏器。周斌接受任务的时候，就很勉强，一下班，他就回家了。康义隆和王振槐找他谈话，回答是：“我连蒸馏器都没见过。”“没见过怕啥，制造出来不就见到了吗？”他们帮他找来汽油桶和蛇形管，又给他讲蒸馏水制造过程和原理。这样，他的信心大了，劲头足了，经过反复试验，周斌的简易蒸馏器试制成功了。小组给周斌戴上光荣花，在会上表扬他，介绍经验，又报告他转变经过。这对周斌是教育，对大家是鼓舞，徒工们立即就掀起了赶周斌的革新竞赛热潮。徒工高玉玺积极钻研，创造了产品密封法，三天就可以完成全月任务。现在，全组每人都有革新创造，有的高达五、六件之多。
    一朵鲜花打扮不出一个美丽的春天，康义隆小组不但自己革新，还帮助别人革新，不但自己超额完成生产任务，而且帮助别人完成任务。他们车间四工区做的滚珠轴承很易生锈。磨工工区找他们想办法。那时他们的生产挺忙，但仍然挤出时间热情帮助，终于配成一种防锈溶液。生锈的滚珠放进去不多时锈不见了，只见滚珠明光闪闪，直耀人眼。他们不但使五万颗滚珠复活了，还使仓库里报废了的一百多套轴承复活了，为国家节约了十万元。另外，康义隆小组还帮助检验室试制成功了明化处理，检试肉眼看不见的裂纹，还为车间试制成功了滚珠电抛光以及调整砂轮等。技术革新运动的深入开展，使劳动强度大大减轻，生产效率大大提高，六个人就可以完成全组三十多个人的任务。现在，康义隆小组成立了共产主义协作队，哪里有困难，就到哪里去，谁需要帮助，就去帮助谁。
