To the esteemed Party Central Committee, to the esteemed Chairman Mao:

We, the comrades attending the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in the fields of industry, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade, entrusted with the earnest expectations of the nation's workers, respectfully extend our most sublime and heartfelt respect to the Party Central Committee and to you!

We are extremely pleased and honored to be able to attend this conference convened by the Party Central Committee and the State Council, to represent the nation's workers in reporting the achievements since the Great Leap Forward, to receive the review and guidance of the Party and the government, and to receive the enthusiastic care and encouragement of the Party and the government. We know that what we have done is only the responsibility that the working class should fulfill in socialist construction. The reason why we have made some achievements is entirely due to the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. We have a common and firm belief. That belief is: Listening to the Party's words and following Chairman Mao will surely lead to victory. Esteemed Chairman Mao! You are the sun radiating boundless light; with you, there is enthusiasm and light; you are the helmsman of victory; with you, we can ride the wind and waves and be invincible. When we think of the Party and you, we are filled with confidence and energy, and we can overcome any difficulty and accomplish anything. Growing up in this great Mao Zedong era, how happy and proud we feel!

Esteemed Party Central Committee, esteemed Chairman Mao! At this conference, the Party and the state pointed out lofty goals for us and put forward great tasks: to rapidly build our country into a great socialist power. We will certainly go all out to catch up with and surpass England in the output of major industrial products within ten years; we will certainly vigorously support agriculture, realize the technological transformation of our country's agriculture as soon as possible, and gradually make agriculture mechanized, irrigated, chemicalized, and electrified; we will certainly follow the Party's instructions, thoroughly oppose right-leaning tendencies, go all out, push the upsurge of the increase production and practice economy movement to a new peak, complete this year's national plan ahead of schedule, and prepare for a continued leap forward next year. Esteemed Party Central Committee, esteemed Chairman Mao! We assure you: We will certainly accomplish these tasks, and we will certainly be able to accomplish these tasks.

Esteemed Party Central Committee, esteemed Chairman Mao! We will forever remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "The working class must transform the entire society in the class struggle and the struggle against nature, and at the same time transform itself. The working class must constantly learn in its work, gradually overcome its shortcomings, and never stop." We will certainly guard against arrogance and rashness, learn with an open mind, strive to make our units and ourselves more advanced, and wholeheartedly help other units and other comrades catch up with the advanced level. We will certainly, shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand with our farmer brothers and revolutionary intellectuals, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the red banner of the General Line, strive forward to build our country into a great socialist power with a modern industry , modern agriculture, modern science and culture as soon as possible!

Long live the great, correct, and glorious Communist Party of China!

Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all nationalities in our country!

All representatives of the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in the fields of industry, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade
