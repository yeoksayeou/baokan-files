    Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Sends Congratulatory Message to Communist Party of Denmark on its Fortieth Anniversary
    Xinhua News Agency, November 6th. The Communist Party of Denmark will celebrate its fortieth anniversary on November 9th. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Denmark on the 2nd, extending warm congratulations. The telegram reads as follows:
    To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Denmark,
    Dear Comrades,
    On the happy occasion of the fortiieth anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of Denmark, the Central Committee of the Communist Part of China extends to you its heartfelt and warm congratulations.
    The founding of the Communist Party of Denmark opened a new page in the history of the Danish people. From then on, the Danish working class found the most reliable organizer and guide for its cause of liberation.
    For the past forty years, the Communist Party of Denmark, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, has shared the fate and breath of the Danish people, and has carried out unremitting struggles to safeguard the national interests of Denmark, defend the democratic rights of the people, and strive for social progress.
    In recent years, the Communist Party of Denmark has also made every effort to unite all patriotic and democratic forces in Denmark, oppose Denmark's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, demand the elimination of the serious consequences brought about by this aggressive bloc in the political, economic and military aspects of Denmark, and strive for Denmark to embark on a path of national independence, democracy and neutrality, and has carried out effective struggles.
    The Communist Party of Denmark firmly stands on the principled position of the proletariat, purged revisionist elements from its ranks, thereby safeguarding the Marxist-Leninist ideological foundation, proletarian internationalism of its ranks, and strengthening the unity of its ranks. The Communist Party of Denmark is winning the growing trust of the Danish working class and the working masses.
    The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have great sympathy and concern for the struggle of the Communist Party of Denmark and the Danish people. We wish the Communist Party of Denmark new achievements in realizing its current main tasks - consolidating the unity of the working class and all patriotic and democratic forces, defending European and world peace, striving for Denmark to get rid of the control of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and realizing Denmark's national independence, democratic reform and neutrality.

    中国共产党中央委员会
    电贺丹共成立四十周年
    新华社6日讯　11月9日是丹麦共产党成立四十周年。中国共产党中央委员会已经在2日致电丹麦共产党中央委员会热烈祝贺。电文如下：丹麦共产党中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    欣逢丹麦共产党成立四十周年纪念，中国共产党中央委员会谨向你们致以衷心的热烈的祝贺。
    丹麦共产党的成立，揭开了丹麦人民历史上的新的一页。丹麦的工人阶级从此找到了自己解放事业的最可靠的组织者和引路人。
    四十年来，丹麦共产党高举马克思列宁主义旗帜，同丹麦人民同命运、共呼吸，为了维护丹麦民族利益、保卫人民民主权利和争取社会进步，进行了坚持不懈的斗争。
    最近许多年来，丹麦共产党还竭尽一切努力，为团结丹麦一切爱国民主力量，反对丹麦加入北大西洋公约组织，要求消除这个侵略集团对于丹麦的政治、经济和军事各方面所带来的严重后果，争取丹麦走上实现民族独立、民主和中立的政策的道路，进行了卓有成效的斗争。
    丹麦共产党坚定地站在无产阶级的原则立场上，从自己的队伍中清除了修正主义分子，从而保卫了自己队伍的马克思列宁主义思想基础、无产阶级国际主义，并且增强了自己队伍的团结。丹麦共产党正在赢得丹麦工人阶级和劳动群众日益增长的信任。
    中国共产党和中国人民，对于丹麦共产党和丹麦人民的斗争，抱着极大的同情和关怀。祝丹麦共产党在实现自己当前的主要任务——巩固工人阶级和一切爱国民主力量的团结，保卫欧洲和世界和平，争取丹麦摆脱北大西洋公约组织的控制，实现丹麦的民族独立、民主革新和中立的斗争中，获得新的成就。
                中国共产党中央委员会　一九五九年十一月二日
