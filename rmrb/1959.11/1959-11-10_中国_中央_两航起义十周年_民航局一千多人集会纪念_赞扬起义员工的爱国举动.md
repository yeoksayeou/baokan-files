Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The Civil Aviation Administration of China held a meeting in Beijing this afternoon to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the "China National Aviation Corporation" (CNAC) and "Central Air Transport Corporation" (CATC) uprising. Over a thousand people attended the meeting, including former employees of CNAC and CATC from all over the country who participated in the uprising, and representatives of employees from the Civil Aviation Administration of China.

Ten years ago today, the 4,000 employees of "China National Aviation Corporation" and "Central Air Transport Corporation" announced their uprising, breaking away from the Kuomintang reactionaries and accepting the leadership of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. At today's commemoration meeting, people enthusiastically praised the patriotic actions of the two airlines' uprising employees and congratulated them for contributing their strength to the great socialist construction cause of the motherland in the posture of masters.

Kong Xiangzhen, Vice Minister of Communications, spoke first at the commemoration meeting. He said that today is the tenth anniversary of the two airlines' uprising, a day worth commemorating. He quoted Chairman Mao's congratulatory telegram to the employees of the two airlines, saying that their "resolute breakaway from the Kuomintang reactionary remnants and embrace of the people's motherland is a patriotic action of great significance." At the time of the uprising, the two airlines had more than 80 aircraft, of which 12 had already flown back to the motherland; the remaining 70-plus aircraft and assets were all left in Hong Kong.

Kong Xiangzhen pointed out in his speech: "The uprising of the two airlines aroused the resentment of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. With the support and connivance of the British government, they used despicable and shameless means such as threats and inducements against the uprising employees, and even the detention and bombing of aircraft to sabotage the uprising. They also illegally seized all of our assets left in Hong Kong, including 71 aircraft." Kong Xiangzhen praised the patriotic stance that the employees of the two airlines had consistently adhered to in the struggle to protect assets in Hong Kong.

Kong Xiangzhen then talked about the brilliant achievements made in China's transportation cause and the current tasks of the transportation sector.

Kuang Rengnong, Vice Minister of Communications and Secretary of the Party Committee of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, expressed warm praise in his speech for the glorious uprising of the employees of the two airlines ten years ago.

Kuang Rengnong said that over the past ten years, under the Party's patient cultivation and education, the employees of the two airlines who participated in the uprising have played a certain role in the development of civil aviation. To date, many of the uprising personnel working within the civil aviation system have honorably joined the Communist Party of China and the Communist Youth League. Some of the uprising personnel have been elected as representatives to the National People's Congress, and some have been elected as members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The co-pilots of the original two airlines at the time of the uprising have now been promoted to captains, more than 30% of whom hold positions above squadron leader. More than 90% of the mechanics at the time of the uprising have been promoted to technicians. Among the engineers and section chiefs and above in the civil aviation system, comrades from the original two airlines' uprising account for 26.7%. This year, among the 181 advanced producers in the bureau, 29 are comrades who participated in the uprising.

Kuang Rengnong said that the main reason why most of the comrades from the original two airlines have been able to progress so rapidly is due to the correct leadership of the Party. In his speech, he encouraged the comrades from the original two airlines to consolidate their existing achievements, work hard to adhere to ideological remolding, always listen to the Party, and follow the socialist road.

Yang Bin and Wang Dayong, representatives of the uprising employees of the two airlines, also spoke at the meeting. They both said that living in such a great era and receiving the kind care and teaching of the beloved Party and Chairman Mao is the greatest happiness. Both of them are already members of the Communist Party of China, and because of their outstanding completion of their work tasks, they recently attended the National Congress of Heroes.

Also present at today's meeting were Chen Ruiguang and Shen Tu, Deputy Directors of the Civil Aviation Administration of China; Hua Fengxiang, representative to the National People's Congress and Deng Shizhang, member of the National Committee of the CPPCC, who were in charge of leading the two airlines' uprising at the time; Pan Guoding, the captain who flew the plane back to Beijing from Hong Kong during the uprising and is now responsible for flight inspection in transport aviation; Bian Rengeng, the current Deputy Director of the Civil Aviation Capital Airport; and Chen Dali, who is currently responsible for flight inspection in specialized aviation.

The conference issued commemorative badges for the tenth anniversary of the uprising of the China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation to the employees of the two airlines who participated in the uprising. After the meeting, Kong Xiangzhen hosted a banquet to entertain the representatives of the employees of the two airlines who participated in the uprising, and a song and dance evening was held in the evening.

    “中国”“中央”两航起义十周年
    民航局一千多人集会纪念
    赞扬起义员工的爱国举动
    据新华社9日讯　中国民用航空局今天下午在北京举行集会，纪念“中国航空公司”和“中央航空公司”起义十周年。来自全国各地的原中国、中央航空公司的起义员工和中国民用航空局的职工代表一千多人出席了大会。
    十年前的今天，“中国航空公司”和“中央航空公司”全体员工四千人宣布起义，脱离国民党反动派，接受中华人民共和国中央人民政府的领导。在今天的纪念会上，人们热烈赞扬两航起义员工的爱国举动，并祝贺他们以主人翁的姿态，为祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业贡献了自己的力量。
    交通部副部长孔祥祯首先在纪念会上讲话。他说，今天是两航起义十周年的日子，这是一个值得纪念的日子。他引毛主席曾致两航起义员工的贺电说，两航起义员工“毅然脱离国民党反动残余，投入人民祖国怀抱，这是一个有重大意义的爱国举动”。两航公司在起义时共有飞机八十多架，除当时十二架已飞回祖国，其余七十多架飞机和资财全部留在香港。
    孔祥祯在讲话中指出：“两航起义，引起了美帝国主义和蒋介石集团的愤恨，他们在英国政府支持和纵容下，对起义员工进行威胁利诱，采用扣押甚至爆炸飞机等卑鄙无耻的手段进行破坏，并陆续非法劫夺了我国所有的包括七十一架飞机在内的全部留在香港的资产”。孔祥祯对两航起义员工在香港的护产斗争中始终坚持了爱国主义立场表示赞扬。
    孔祥祯接着谈到了我国交通事业中所取得的辉煌成就和当前交通运输部门的任务。
    交通部副部长、中共中国民航局党委书记邝任农，在讲话中对两航起义员工十年前的光荣起义行动，表示热烈赞扬。
    邝任农说，十年来，两航起义员工在党的耐心培养和教育下，对民航事业的发展起了一定的作用。到目前为止，在民航范围内工作的起义人员，已有很多人光荣地参加了中国共产党和共青团。起义人员中有的被选为全国人民代表大会代表，有的被选为全国政协委员。起义时原两航公司的副驾驶到现在都被提升为正驾驶，其中有30％以上的人担任中队长以上的职务，起义时的机械员90％以上已提升为技术员，现在民航系统内工程师和科长以上的领导干部中，原两航起义的同志占26.7％，今年全局一百八十一名先进生产者中就有二十九名是起义的同志。
    邝任农说，原两航同志大多数所以能够迅速的进步，主要是由于党的正确领导。他在讲话中勉励原两航的同志们，巩固已有的成绩，努力坚持思想改造，永远听党的话，走社会主义的道路。
    两航起义员工代表杨斌和汪大用也在会上讲了话。他们都表示，生活在这样伟大的时代，得到亲爱的党和毛主席的亲切关怀和教导，这是最大的幸福。他们两人都已经是中国共产党的党员，由于他们出色地完成了工作任务，最近都出席了全国群英大会。
    出席今天大会的，还有中国民用航空局副局长陈瑞光、沈图，当时参加领导两航起义的负责人：全国人民代表大会代表华凤翔、全国政协委员邓士章，起义时驾驶飞机从香港回到北京的机长：现在负责运输航空飞行检查方面工作的潘国定、现任民航首都航空站副站长的边任耕和现在负责专业航空飞行检查方面工作的陈达礼等。
    大会向两航起义员工发了中国、中央航空公司起义十周年纪念章。会后，孔祥祯设宴招待两航起义员工代表，晚上举行了歌舞晚会。
