Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 8th: After a month-long arduous struggle, the broad masses of people's commune members in Henan Province have achieved a brilliant victory in combating drought and planting wheat. As of November 3rd, the province had sown 70,085,000 mu of wheat, exceeding the planting plan by 4.7%. Now, from the Taihang Mountains in the north to the Dabie Mountains in the south, newly emerged wheat seedlings are a lush green. People's commune members are widely carrying out field management activities such as checking seedlings, replanting, watering at the roots, and applying fertilizer at the roots.

When Henan Province began sowing wheat at the end of September and the beginning of October this year, the drought in most of the autumn-sown land had not yet been relieved. Among them, more than 20 million mu of land in eastern and northern Henan had been short of rain and suffered from drought since the summer. However, the broad masses of people's commune members, who had overcome the severe summer drought and won a bumper autumn harvest, firmly believed that "man can conquer nature." They enthusiastically responded to the call of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to "establish a long-term drought resistance perspective and grow wheat well even without rain." Under the leadership of party organizations at all levels, they actively engaged in the struggle to combat drought and plant wheat. Because the broad masses of commune members were full of energy, wheat was planted quickly, well, and in large quantities everywhere. Before sowing, all the wheat fields in the province were deeply plowed, with more than 65 million mu being plowed to a depth of eight inches or more. More than 8,000 jin of base fertilizer were applied per mu, and rational close planting was generally implemented.

The victory in combating drought and planting wheat fully demonstrates the infinite power of the people's commune. In the severely drought-stricken areas of the province, the people's communes formed professional teams of more than 3 million people during the tense three-autumn work period to vigorously carry out water conservancy construction. Since September alone, the province has built more than 600,000 large and small channels, dug 560,000 new wells, excavated more than 90,000 artesian springs, and renovated more than 1,100 reservoirs, improving and expanding the irrigated area. In addition, the practice of carrying water to plant spots enabled more than 20 million mu of severely drought-stricken land to be planted with wheat in a timely manner. In Xuegou People's Commune, Guancun Brigade, Yuxian County, 350 commune members worked hard for ten days, bypassing two mountains, filling in 22 ditches, and tunneling through 13 ridges to build a six-mile-long channel, drawing water to the ridge and turning 1,300 mu of old graveyard ridge wheat fields into irrigated land. Dengfeng County, located at the foot of Mount Song, in order to plant wheat in a timely manner, all communes set up water dragon arrays and built a large number of suspended pole forests. Machines were lined up in teams, and waterwheels were integrated into groups to rush irrigation and rush planting. The county also blocked all 120 rivers and concentrated on building water diversion projects to expand the irrigated area by more than 40,000 mu.

In the movement to combat drought and plant wheat, the people's communes in various places, based on the principles of equal exchange, mutual assistance, and mutual benefit, vigorously promoted a spirit of cooperation and organized large-scale operations. In Yanshi County, the communes organized 151 production brigades along the banks of the Yi and Luo Rivers with good water conservancy conditions that had already completed wheat planting to extract 120,000 laborers and more than 2,000 head of livestock, carrying drought-resistant wheat planting tools to help the north and south slopes, which lacked moisture and had difficulty in combating drought, to rush plant wheat, irrigating and planting more than 4,500 mu of wheat fields in one day. In Yuxian County, located in the Funiu Mountain area, in the case of exhaustion of water sources in some areas, due to the organization of county-wide socialist cooperation between mountainous and plain areas, and between areas with water and areas lacking water, the county completed the wheat sowing task 15 days ahead of schedule, of which more than 73% was drought-resistant irrigation and planting. Commune members reflected that the people's commune has great strength, and cooperation has blossomed into a great leap forward.

Various localities have also vigorously engaged in land leveling and garden-style farming in the fight against drought and wheat planting. This year, the province has realized 53.85 million mu of garden-style wheat fields, of which nearly 30 million mu are large-scale high-yield demonstration plots. In Luoyang Prefecture, garden-style wheat fields in Yanshi County accounted for 73% of the total wheat sowing area. Luoyang Prefecture has realized garden-style farming for 2.49 million mu of wheat fields.

The people's communes in various places made every effort to use vacant land to expand the wheat sowing area. The four prefectures of Xinxiang, Nanyang, Xuchang, and Kaifeng alone expanded the sowing area by more than 4 million mu. After completing the original wheat sowing plan, Xinxiang Prefecture extracted more than 2 million laborers and 160 tractors to fight in the Yellow River滩区(tān qū - flood plains) and turned the滩区(tān qū - flood plains) that had been swallowed by the Yellow River for years into boundless green wheat fields. In just over half a month, the entire region planted an additional 1.44 million mu of wheat.

    发挥公社优越性  无雨也能种好麦
    河南抗旱种麦超额完成计划
    新华社郑州8日电　经过历时一个月的顽强斗争，河南省广大人民公社社员已经获得抗旱种麦的辉煌胜利。截至11月3日，全省播种小麦七千零八十五万亩，超过播种计划4.7％。现在，北起太行山，南到大别山，新出土的麦苗一片油绿，人民公社的社员们正在田间广泛地展开了查苗补种、浇压根水和施压根肥的管理活动。
    河南省今年9月底10月初开始播种小麦时，大部分秋播土地的旱象尚未解除。其中，豫东豫北等地二千多万亩土地，自夏季以来就缺雨受旱。但是，战胜了严重夏旱，赢得了秋季大丰收的广大人民公社社员，坚信“人定胜天”，他们热烈响应中共河南省委提出的“树立长期抗旱观点，无雨也要种好麦”的号召，在各地各级党组织的领导下，积极投入抗旱种麦斗争。由于广大社员干劲十足，各地小麦种得又多又快又好。全省麦田在播种前都进行了深翻，深翻八寸以上的达六千五百多万亩；每亩施底肥八千斤以上，并且普遍实行了合理密植。
    抗旱种麦的胜利，充分显示了人民公社具有无穷的威力。全省干旱严重地区的各人民公社在紧张的三秋工作中，组成了三百多万人的专业队，大搞水利建设。仅9月份以来，全省就修成大小渠道六十多万条，打新井五十六万眼，挖自流泉九万多眼，整修水库一千一百多座，改善和扩大了灌溉面积，加上挑水点种，使受旱严重的两千多万亩土地都及时种上了小麦。禹县薛沟人民公社官村大队的三百五十名社员，突击十天，绕过两架山，填平二十二道沟，挖通十三道岭，修了一条长达六里的渠道，引水上岗，使老坟岗一千三百亩麦田变成了水烧地。位于嵩山脚下的登封县，为了及时种上小麦，各公社都大摆水龙阵，大搞吊杆林，机器排成队，水车集成群，抢浇抢种。全县还把一百二十多条河流全部闸断，突击兴修引水上岗工程，扩大了水浇地面积四万多亩。
    在抗旱种麦运动中，各地人民公社都根据等价交换互助互利的原则，大兴协作之风，组织大兵团作战。偃师县各公社组织伊洛河两岸水利条件好已经种完小麦的一百五十一个生产大队，抽出十二万名劳力，两千多头牲口，携带抗旱种麦工具，帮助没墒缺水抗旱困难的南北两坡突击种麦，一天连浇带种四千五百多亩麦田。地处伏牛山区的禹县，在部分地区水源枯竭的情况下，由于组织了全县性的山区与平原，有水地区与缺水地区的社会主义大协作，全县提前十五天完成了麦播任务，其中73％以上的都是抗旱浇种的。社员反映说：人民公社力量大，协作开出了跃进花。
    各地在抗旱种麦中还大搞平整土地和园田化。全省今年实现园田化的麦田有五千三百八十五万多亩，其中有将近三千万亩是大面积丰产方。洛阳专区偃师县的园田化麦田占麦田播种总面积73％。洛阳专区有二百四十九万亩麦田实现了园田化。
    各地人民公社尽量利用空闲地扩大麦播面积。仅新乡、南阳、许昌、开封四个专区就扩大播种面积四百多万亩。新乡专区在完成了原订麦播计划后，又抽出二百多万劳力和一百六十多台拖拉机，大战黄河滩区，把历年被黄水吞没的滩地，变成一望无际的葱绿的麦田，仅仅半个多月，全区就多种小麦一百四十四万亩。
