    Shanghai and Liaoning Add New Power Sources
    Wu Jing Thermal Power Plant, Liaoning Power Plant, and Tiexi Power Station Each Have a Unit Generating Electricity
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai’s first modern thermal power plant—the Wu Jing Thermal Power Plant—successfully generated electricity with its newly installed first 25,000-kilowatt turbine generator unit on the 5th. The second turbine generator unit of the same size is being actively installed and is expected to be put into production next month.
    The construction speed of this power plant is two and a half years faster than the construction of a similar type of thermal power station during the First Five-Year Plan, which took three years. It is also more than half a year faster than the thermal power station built in thirteen months during the Great Leap Forward last year.
    The first phase of construction of the Wu Jing Thermal Power Plant is quite large in scale. It will build a reinforced concrete main plant building as high as 42 meters, a reinforced concrete chimney 80 meters high, a 280-meter-long coal conveying trestle bridge, drainage ditches for 300,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment, and install a high-temperature and high-pressure boiler from the Soviet Union, two 25,000-kilowatt turbine generators, and a large number of transformer and other electrical control equipment.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th, the first turbine generator unit independently manufactured by our country at the Liaoning Power Plant began generating electricity ahead of schedule on November 10th. By this point, the first phase of the main plant building of the Liaoning Power Plant and the auxiliary projects for water supply, coal transportation, ash removal, substation, and power transmission of the entire plant have been basically completed.
    The workers at the construction site are determined to complete this year's construction tasks ahead of schedule, and they are currently continuing to install equipment in full swing. Two units from the Soviet Union and one unit from the German Democratic Republic will also generate electricity one after another soon.
    This large-scale thermal power plant, designed and constructed by our country independently, incorporates the latest achievements of modern thermal power generation technology in its design. The magnificent plant will be fully equipped with high-efficiency, coal-saving, high-temperature and high-pressure boilers and highly automated turbine generator equipment.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the newly built second generator unit of the Tiexi Power Station in Shenyang officially generated electricity. The designed capacity of this unit is 25,000 kilowatts, and all the equipment is manufactured by our own country. During the trial operation, the quality of the machine, furnace, etc. all met the national requirements and standards.

    上海辽宁增加新电源
    吴泾热电厂辽宁电厂铁西电站各有一套机组发电
    据新华社讯　上海市第一座现代化的热电厂—吴泾热电厂，新安装的第一套二万五千瓩汽轮发电机组在5日顺利地发电；第二套同样大小的汽轮发电机组正在积极安装，准备在下个月投入生产。
    这座电厂的建设速度，比第一个五年计划期间用三年时间建设同样类型的热电站，快了两年半；比去年大跃进中用十三个月时间建成的热电站也快了半年多。
    吴泾热电厂的第一期建设工程规模相当大，它要建筑高达四十二米的钢筋混凝土主厂房，八十米高的钢筋混凝土大烟囱，二百八十米长的运煤栈桥，供三十万瓩发电设备用的排水沟，以及安装来自苏联的一台高温高压锅炉、两套二万五千瓩汽轮发电机和大批变压器等电气控制设备。
    据新华社沈阳12日电　辽宁电厂第一台由我国自制的汽轮发电机组，已提前在11月10日开始发电。至此，辽宁电厂的第一期主厂房工程和全厂供水、输煤、除灰、变电、输电等附属工程基本建成。
    工地职工决心提前完成今年的施工任务，目前他们正在继续紧张地安装设备。来自苏联的两台机组和来自德意志民主共和国的一台机组，不久也将陆续发电。
    这座由我国自行设计、自行施工的大型火力发电厂，在设计上集中了现代火力发电技术的最新成就。在宏大的厂房里，将全部安装效率高、耗煤省的高温高压锅炉和高度自动化的汽轮发电机设备。
    据新华社讯　沈阳铁西电站新建的第二个发电机组正式发电。这个机组设计能力为二万五千瓩，全套设备都是由我国自己制造的。在试运转中，机、炉等质量都达到国家要求标准。
