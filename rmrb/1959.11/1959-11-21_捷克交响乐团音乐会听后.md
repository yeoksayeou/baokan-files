    Listening to the concert of the Czechoslovak Republic's Czech Symphony Orchestra, which enjoys a worldwide reputation, is a major event in China's music scene. Although Chinese audiences have long been familiar with the orchestra's outstanding performances through records and broadcasts, it is only after hearing their concerts in Beijing that we truly appreciate the expressive power of their heart-stirring music.

    Since its establishment, the glorious history of the Czech Symphony Orchestra for more than 60 years has been closely linked to the development of the Czech national music school. On January 4, 1896, the orchestra's first concert was performed under the baton of the great composer Dvořák. For more than half a century, the Czech Symphony Orchestra has spared no effort in performing the works of great Czech composers such as Smetana, Dvořák, Fibich, Novák, and Suk. At the same time, the orchestra's repertoire also includes excellent works from all over the world. Great composers such as Glazunov from Russia, Grieg from Norway, and Mahler from Austria have all performed on the Czech Orchestra's podium.

    Over the decades, thanks to their hard work, they have accumulated excellent performance traditions. Especially after liberation, thanks to the strong support of the government, the orchestra has achieved unprecedented development and expanded into a large symphony orchestra of 120 people. Music lovers all over the world praise its excellent performing arts, and it is recognized as one of the best symphony orchestras in the world.

    Their first performance in Beijing was a great success. After each piece, the audience responded with warm applause and cheers. The characteristics of the entire orchestra's performance are many, with the most prominent being the rigor of the ensemble and the flawless transparency of the intonation. The changes in color and levels on various instruments and the application of techniques are rich and diverse. Every performer has a high level of technical skill, and their extremely refined handling of every detail of every musical phrase is integrated into a harmonious whole.

    The amplitude of the orchestra's dynamic changes is large, and the levels are distinct. The contrast between loud and soft is strikingly dramatic. But this is by no means contrived. When its sound is faint, it is still round and not hoarse, and when it is extremely loud, it is bright and not noisy.

    The woodwind section's performance is very eye-catching. The chords they play are accurate and harmonious, just like a well-tuned organ. The sound of the brass section is full and powerful.

    The entire string section consists of highly accomplished performers. The cooperation between each voice is not only neat but also subtly consistent. It is particularly worth mentioning that the concertmaster, Ludvík, is an outstanding musician, as can be seen from the arrangement of various bowing techniques in the violin section. Similarly, the principal cellist, Večtomov, is also a very accomplished artist.

    The achievements and performance style of the Czech Symphony Orchestra are inseparable from the efforts and cultivation of the orchestra's artistic director and chief conductor, Ančerl. Ančerl was a student of Talich, the famous Czech conductor. During World War II, German fascists imprisoned him in concentration camps for several years, where he suffered torture. He did not pick up the baton again until after the liberation of Czechoslovakia. In 1950, Ančerl became the artistic director of the Czech Symphony Orchestra. Under his leadership, the orchestra has achieved great success. At the concert on the 19th, we heard the orchestra perform Smetana's "The Bartered Bride" overture extremely well under his baton. The Beijing audience listened with great interest to the Czech orchestra's interpretation of the most familiar "New World Symphony" from Dvořák's homeland. Their performance is the most in line with the original author's intention, and it is the best performance of this symphony we have heard. Although Dvořák used black and Indian melodies and rhythms in the piece, we still deeply feel the local atmosphere of Czechoslovakia and appreciate the author's fervent longing for his motherland. Pianist Panenka played Schumann's Piano Concerto fluently and poetically, and the orchestra's accompaniment was accomplished brilliantly and appropriately. It is gratifying that our Czechoslovak friends played the two short pieces "Evening Party" and "Senjideima" by He Luting for us in a refined and lighthearted manner.

    The performance of Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition" was the highlight of the evening. Here, the conductor and the entire orchestra deployed all their skills, and everyone fully demonstrated their mastery of technique. Of course, it is not just about showing off skills. As a musician, I deeply appreciate how much the Czech musicians love art. They have spent so much hard work for the lofty purpose of artistic expression.

    We thank the Czech Communist Party and the Czechoslovak government for sending us such a good artistic group, giving our young symphony orchestra workers a good opportunity to learn. It is especially gratifying that judging from the degree of enthusiastic welcome from the audience, the Czech artists have found kindred spirits in our country. This shows that their performance has further promoted understanding and friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia. Congratulations to the Czech Symphony Orchestra on the success of their performance, and congratulations to the Czechoslovak musicians on their greater achievements.

    捷克交响乐团音乐会听后
    李德伦
    在全世界享有盛誉的捷克斯洛伐克共和国捷克交响乐团来华演出，是我国乐坛上的一件大事。我国听众虽然在唱片和广播节目中早已熟悉这个乐团卓越的演奏；但只有听了他们在北京举行的音乐会，我们才真正体会到了他们所演奏的动人心弦音乐的表现力量。
    捷克交响乐团自建立以来，六十多年的光辉历史是和捷克民族乐派的发展紧密地连结在一起的。1896年1月4日乐团的第一个音乐会就是在伟大的作曲家德沃夏克指挥之下演出的。半个多世纪以来，捷克交响乐团不遗余力地演出了斯美塔那、德沃夏克、费比赫、诺瓦克、苏克等捷克大作曲家们的作品。同时乐团的保留节目中，也包括了全世界的优秀曲目。大作曲家们像俄罗斯的格拉祖诺夫，挪威的格利克，奥地利的马勒都曾站在捷克乐团的指挥台上演出过。
    几十年来，由于他们的辛勤劳动，积累了优秀的演奏传统。尤其是解放以后，由于政府的大力支持，乐团得到了空前的发展，扩充成为一百二十人的大型交响乐团。全世界的音乐爱好者同声称誉它的优秀的演奏艺术，公认为全世界最好的交响乐团之一。
    他们在北京的首次演出获得极大的成功，每个节目演完之后听众都报以极热烈的掌声和欢呼声。整个乐团在演奏上的特点很多，突出的是：合奏上的严整，和音准的透明无瑕。各种乐器上色彩层次的变化和技巧方法的运用都是丰富而多样的。每个演奏员都具有高度的技术水平，他们每个人对每一个乐句细部极为精致的处理，都溶合在全体一致的谐调中。
    乐队力度变化的幅度很大，层次分明。强弱的对比有惊人的戏剧性。但这绝不是强作出来的，当它的声音在微弱时仍圆润而不嘶哑，极强时宏亮而不噪破。
    木管组的演奏是很惹人注目的。他们演奏出来的和弦准确而和谐，正像调得很准的管风琴一样。铜管组的声音很饱满而雄厚。
    整个的弦乐组都是修养很高的演奏家。每个声部合作的关系不仅整齐而且是入微的一致。特别值得提出的是首席小提琴陆德维克，我们从提琴声部各种弓法的安排可以看出他是一个卓越的音乐家。同样的，首席大提琴维赤托莫夫也是一个很有修养的艺术家。
    捷克交响乐团的成就和演奏的风格是和乐团的艺术指导、首席指挥安切尔的努力和修养分不开的。安切尔是捷克斯洛伐克著名指挥塔莱赫的学生。在第二次世界大战时期德国法西斯把他关入集中营达数年之久，曾受尽折磨。捷克斯洛伐克解放之后他才又重新拿起指挥棒来。1950年起，安切尔担任了捷克交响乐团的艺术指导。乐团在他的率领下获得极大的成功。我们在19日的音乐会上，听到乐团在他的指挥之下极为出色地演奏了斯美塔那的“被出卖的新嫁娘”序曲。北京的听众以最大的兴趣，听了来自德沃夏克祖国的乐团对于最熟悉的“新大陆交响乐”的解释。他们的演奏是最符合原作者的意图的，这是我们听到的这个交响乐的最好的一次演奏。虽然德沃夏克在曲中用了黑人和印地安人的旋律与节奏，但我们仍然深深地感觉到了捷克斯洛伐克的乡土气息，体会到了作者对于他的祖国的那样热烈的怀忆。钢琴家潘南卡流畅而诗意盎然地演奏了舒曼的钢琴协奏曲，乐队的伴奏完成得出色而恰如其分。可喜的是捷克斯洛伐克朋友们隽永而轻快地为我们演奏了贺绿汀的“晚会”和“森吉得马”两首小曲。
    莫索尔斯基的“图画展览会”的演奏是这天晚上的最高峰。在这里指挥和全体乐队都施展开了他们全身的解数，每一个人都淋漓尽致地表现了他们那巨匠的技巧。当然这不只是表现技巧。作为一个音乐工作者，我深刻地体会到，捷克斯洛伐克的音乐家们是如何的热爱艺术。为了艺术表现的崇高目的，他们花了多少辛勤的劳动。
    我们感谢捷克斯洛伐克的党和政府给我们派来了这么好的艺术团体，给我国年青的交响乐工作者们一个很好的学习机会。尤其令人高兴的是由听众热烈欢迎的程度看来，捷克斯洛伐克的艺术家们在我国找到了知音的朋友。这说明了他们的演奏，更促进了中捷两国人民之间的了解与友谊。祝贺捷克交响乐团演出的成功，祝贺捷克斯洛伐克的音乐家们取得更伟大的成就。
