    The Korean People Resolutely Demand the Early Realization of Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland
    Li Yonghao, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China
    Not long ago, the Sixth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, held in Pyongyang, adopted a series of major measures in order to realize the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, which the Korean people have been longing for day and night. The meeting passed a letter to the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea and the South Korean people, as well as a letter to the parliaments of all countries in the world, on the issue of peaceful reunification of the fatherland.
    These historic documents, passed by the meeting, have stirred up moving reactions among all the people who are looking forward to the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and have aroused active support and concern from peace-loving people all over the world. In particular, the 600 million Chinese people, together with the people of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, have voiced their support, and this is growing stronger.
    The Republic government's plan for peaceful reunification includes the following proposals: after the withdrawal of all foreign troops, headed by the American invading army, from South Korea, free elections should be held throughout Korea; in order to promote peaceful reunification, the armistice should be directed towards lasting peace, and the number of troops in both North and South Korea should be reduced to less than 100,000 each; broad economic and cultural exchanges between North and South Korea should be realized, with mutual visits and exchange of letters; and representatives from North and South Korea should consult to discuss all these issues.
    At the same time, in order to implement the Republic government's plan, the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea proposed that political parties, social organizations, or individuals and the highest power organs of both North and South Korea, can sit down together for open and honest discussions in any form; and it called on the parliaments of all countries in the world and social figures around the world to support our people's lofty and peace-loving cause of forcing the U.S. military to withdraw from South Korea, and requested the parliaments of countries with troops stationed in Korea to discuss recalling their troops and urging their governments to withdraw their troops from South Korea immediately.
    This is the expression of the unanimous will of the entire Korean people.
    This time, the Republic government's plan for peaceful reunification of the fatherland has once again clarified its position in this era of great change and historical turning point, namely: the strong material guarantee for peaceful reunification of the fatherland—the socialist construction in the northern half—is developing by leaps and bounds, forming a huge high tide; internationally, the forces of peace and socialism far exceed and overwhelm the forces of war on a global scale, and the trend of easing tensions is surging forward.
    In the northern half of the Republic, under the unfavorable conditions of the north and south being divided into two, and under the circumstances that the people's economy was completely destroyed by the war launched by U.S. imperialism, it has relied closely on the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, and has successfully completed the arduous task of socialist construction, laying a solid foundation for national economic independence. The production volume of one year in 1946 can now be completed in twenty days. This year, the average per capita production of important products will exceed that of Japan, a capitalist industrial country.
    With the support of a strong industry, the countryside has completed collectivization; in the short period of time to come, the water conservancy, electrification, and mechanization of the countryside will be completed.
    With the rapid development of industry and agriculture, the people's lives have also improved significantly. The problem of food, clothing, and housing for our people has been basically solved. In this way, material reserves have been created for the country's life. The leap-forward surge of this socialist construction in the northern half of the Republic, the improvement of the Korean people's political consciousness, and the victory of the belief in peace on the international stage, which is the material guarantee for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, give this measure a great practical and mobilizing significance.
    The Korean people are an indivisible and unified nation. The suffering and pain endured by the Korean people, who have been artificially divided for more than fourteen years, are immeasurable.
    In the southern half of Korea, due to the colonial enslavement policies and traitorous policies of U.S. imperialism and the Lee Seung-man gang, the national economy has been completely bankrupted.
    The important industrial production in South Korea's industries is not only stagnant, but also small and medium-sized enterprises, which account for the vast majority of the economic composition of South Korea, have 80% of them stopped or reduced working hours. Agriculture, the main target of plunder by U.S. imperialism and the Lee Seung-man gang, is also desolate. At the end of Japanese rule, South Korea could export more than 8 million seok of rice, which was fully capable of guaranteeing food in the region, but now, even including 1958, which the South Korean puppet government called the "largest" rice harvest year in history, it has had to import nearly 5.29 million seok of grain.
    Today, there are 6.6 million unemployed people wandering the streets of South Korea, a number that accounts for half of the workforce in South Korea. Three million food-deprived farmers are struggling on the brink of starvation. In the past year alone, more than 240,000 innocent people have been slaughtered, imprisoned, and persecuted. This is the unprecedented tragic scene that shrouds South Korea.
    The reason for such stark differences between North and South Korea lies in the artificial division of the fatherland into two. Therefore, peaceful reunification of the fatherland will inevitably become the most important task for the Korean people at present.
    In order to solve this most lofty task, the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government have put forward a series of reasonable and concrete plans in every period of the fatherland's economic development.
    If U.S. imperialism and the Lee Seung-man gang had not stubbornly refused and obstructed it, our fatherland would have been unified long ago, and the people in the southern half would not be suffering such tragic hardships today.
    U.S. imperialism and the Lee Seung-man gang once responded to our sincere peace proposals by launching a war. After the Korean armistice was realized, the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government continuously and patiently proposed that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea and that free elections be held throughout Korea on a democratic basis in order to realize the reunification of the fatherland, in order to lead the armistice towards lasting peace.
    Supporting the statement of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on February 5, 1958, the Chinese People's Volunteers had already taken the initiative to withdraw completely from the northern half a year ago. This fact is not only another expression of the Chinese people's great concern and support for the peaceful reunification of Korea, but also opens up a new situation for the peaceful development of Korea.
    However, U.S. imperialism and the Lee Seung-man gang have been entrenched in South Korea, brutally undermining the armistice agreement, and even transporting atomic and missile weapons into South Korea, expanding the Lee Seung-man gang army, and further frantically pursuing a policy of war and aggression.
    All the root causes of Korea's national misfortune and division, as well as the new danger of war in Korea, lie in the continued occupation of South Korea by the aggressive troops of U.S. imperialism.
    The plan for unifying the fatherland profoundly clarified by the Supreme People's Assembly this time aims to eradicate all these root causes and resolve the issue of Korean unification by peaceful means. This not only fully conforms to the national interests of the entire Korean people, but also fully conforms to the world's peace interests.
    The experience of the Korean War has clearly proven that the Korean issue cannot be resolved by war. Unresolved international issues should not be resolved by war, but should be resolved peacefully through negotiations. The United States has had to admit this in the Soviet-American summit in September of this year. Therefore, the United States should take practical actions, that is, withdraw its troops from South Korea, Taiwan, and other regions, to adapt to the requirements of the times.
    If the U.S. ruling class has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of the Korean people and has no intention of imposing its barbaric aggressive intentions on the Korean people, then it has no reason to station its troops in South Korea. It is obvious that as long as the aggressive troops of U.S. imperialism still occupy South Korea, a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue cannot be expected.
    As the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea pointed out in its letter to the parliaments of all countries in the world: "The resolution of the Korean issue must never be placed on two parallel lines of peace and war that can never be combined."
    The Korean issue must be resolved without delay.
    If Korea is unified, then without a doubt, with the support of the northern half, which has a strong material foundation, the three thousand miles of rivers and mountains of the thirty million people will surely become a magnificent and happy paradise. At the same time, Korea's unification on a democratic basis will also make a great contribution to maintaining peace in the Far East and the world.
    The aggressive troops of U.S. imperialism get out of South Korea! This is the demand of all the Korean people from the bottom of their national conscience, and it is also the unanimous wish of peace-loving people all over the world.
    We firmly believe that the people of all countries, social and political activists, and brotherly Chinese people who love peace and justice all over the world will actively support our great national cause.

### 朝鲜人民坚决要求早日实现祖国和平统一

    朝鲜人民坚决要求早日实现祖国和平统一
    朝鲜驻华特命全权大使　李永镐
    不久以前在平壤召开的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议二届六次会议，为了早日实现朝鲜人民梦寐以求的祖国和平统一，采取了一系列重大措施。会议就和平统一祖国问题通过了致大韩民国国会和南朝鲜人民的信，以及致世界各国议会的信。
    会议通过的这些历史性文件，公布没有多久，便在一日千秋般盼望祖国和平统一的全体人民当中激起了动人的反应，唤起了全世界爱好和平人民积极的支持和关心。特别是六亿中国人民，同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民一道，发出了支持的呼声，并且日益高涨。
    共和国政府关于和平统一的方案，包括这样一些建议：以美国侵略军队为首的一切外国军队撤出南朝鲜以后，在全朝鲜实行自由选举；为了促进和平统一，将停战导向持久和平，并把南北朝鲜的军队数目各裁到十万人以下；实现南北朝鲜之间广泛的经济和文化交流，互相来往，互通书信；为了讨论所有这些问题，由南北朝鲜代表进行协商。
    同时，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议为了实现共和国政府的方案，又提出：无论是南北朝鲜的政党、社会团体或个别人士和最高权力机关，可以不拘形式，开诚布公地坐在一起进行讨论；并且呼吁：要求世界各国议会和全世界社会人士支持我国人民迫使美军撤出南朝鲜的爱好和平的崇高事业，要求在朝鲜派有军队的各国议会讨论召还本国军队，敦促本国政府把自己的军队立即撤出南朝鲜。
    这是全体朝鲜人民一致意志的表现。
    这次共和国政府和平统一祖国的方案，是在这样的伟大变革时期和历史转折时期又一次阐明了自己的立场，即：和平统一祖国的强大物质保证——北半部的社会主义建设，正在飞跃发展，形成了巨大的高潮；国际上，和平和社会主义力量在全世界范围内大大超过和压倒了战争力量，缓和紧张局势的潮流汹涌奔腾。
    共和国北半部，在南北分裂为二的不利条件下，在人民经济由于美帝国主义发动的战争而遭到彻底破坏的情况下，紧紧依靠以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党中央委员会和共和国政府的英明领导，胜利地完成着艰巨的社会主义建设任务，奠定了稳固的民族经济自立基础。1946年一年的生产量，现在二十天就能完成。今年，重要产品按人口平均计算，将会超过资本主义工业国的日本。
    在强大工业的支援下，农村已经完成了集体化；今后短短的时间内，将会完成农村的水利化、电气化和机械化。
    随着工业和农业的迅速发展，人民生活也显著提高。我国人民的衣食住问题已经基本解决。这样，就给国家生活造成了物质储备。祖国和平统一的物质保证——共和国北半部的这种社会主义建设的飞跃高涨，和朝鲜人民政治觉悟的提高，以及和平信念在国际舞台上的胜利，使得这次的措施具有巨大的实际意义和动员意义。
    朝鲜人民是绝对不能分离的单一民族。被人为地分裂了十四年以上的朝鲜人民，这期间所遭受的不幸和痛苦，是无法估量的。
    朝鲜的南半部，由于美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮的殖民地奴化政策和卖国政策，民族经济已经全面破产。
    南朝鲜产业中的重要工业生产，不仅停滞不前，而且在南朝鲜经济组成当中占绝大部分比重的中小企业，也有80％停工或减少开工时间。美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮的主要掠夺对象——农业，也荒废不堪。在日寇统治末期，南朝鲜能出口八百多万石大米，完全能够保障本地区的粮食，但是现在，就连包括南朝鲜傀儡政府称为历史上“最大”大米丰收年的1958年，也不得不进口将近五百二十九万石的粮食。
    今天，南朝鲜有六百六十万失业者在街头傍徨，这个数目占南朝鲜有劳动力的人的一半。为数达三百万的断粮农民，挣扎在饥饿线上。只是去年一年，就有二十四万多无辜人民被屠杀、下狱和遭到迫害。这就是笼罩着南朝鲜的千古罕见的悲惨景象。
    朝鲜南北之间如此截然不同，其原因就在于祖国被人为地分裂为二。因此，和平统一祖国，就必然会成为朝鲜人民当前最重大的任务。
    为了解决这一最崇高的任务，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府，在祖国经济发展的每一个时期，都提出了一系列既合理又具体的方案。
    如果美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮不是一味顽固地拒绝和阻挠的话，我们的祖国早就会统一了，而南半部人民今天也就不会蒙受这种悲惨的苦难。
    美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮，曾经用发动战争来回答我们诚恳的和平倡议。朝鲜停战实现以后，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府，为了把停战导向持久和平，又连续耐心地提出了一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，在民主基础上实行全朝鲜自由选举，以实现祖国统一的建议。
    中国人民志愿军支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府1958年2月5日声明，已经在一年以前主动全部撤出了北半部。这一事实，不仅是中国人民对朝鲜和平统一又一次巨大关心和支持的表示，而且为朝鲜的和平发展打开了新的局面。
    然而，美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮却一直盘踞在南朝鲜，粗暴地破坏停战协定，甚至把原子和导弹武器运入南朝鲜，扩充李承晚匪军，进一步疯狂地奉行战争侵略政策。
    朝鲜的民族不幸和分裂，以及在朝鲜产生的新战争危险，其一切祸根都在于美帝国主义侵略军队继续霸占南朝鲜。
    这次最高人民会议深刻阐明的统一祖国方案，其目的就是铲除这一切祸根，用和平方法解决朝鲜统一问题。这不仅完全符合全体朝鲜人民的民族利益，而且也完全符合世界和平利益。
    朝鲜战争的经验早已清楚地证明：战争方法解决不了朝鲜问题。悬而未决的国际问题，不应该用战争方式解决，而应该通过谈判方式和平解决。这一点，美国已在今年9月的苏美首脑会谈中不得不予以承认。因此，美国应该以实际行动，即从南朝鲜、台湾和其它地区，撤出自己的军队，以适应时代要求。
    如果美国统治阶级无意干涉朝鲜人民的内政，无意把自己野蛮的侵略意图强加在朝鲜人民身上，那么它就没有任何理由再把自己的军队驻扎在南朝鲜。显而易见，只要美帝国主义侵略军队还霸占着南朝鲜，朝鲜问题的和平解决就不能期待。
    正如朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议在致世界各国议会的信中所指出：“朝鲜问题的解决，决不能放置在永远不能合而为一的和平和战争这样两条平行线上面。”
    朝鲜问题必须毫不迟延地获得解决。
    如果朝鲜统一起来，那么毫无疑问，在具有强大物质基础的北半部的支援下，三千万民族的三千里江山，一定会变成一个宏伟壮丽的幸福乐园。同时，朝鲜在民主基础上获得统一，也将会对维护远东和世界和平作出巨大贡献。
    美帝国主义侵略军队滚出南朝鲜！这是全体朝鲜人民出自民族良心的要求，也是全世界爱好和平人民的一致愿望。
    我们深信，全世界爱好和平和正义的所有国家人民、社会政治活动家，以及兄弟的中国人民，将会积极支持我们的这一全民的伟大事业。
