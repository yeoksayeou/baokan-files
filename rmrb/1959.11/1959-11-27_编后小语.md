Post-Editing Notes

The current production situation throughout the country is extremely good. Under the inspiration of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of people are opposing Rightist tendencies and boosting their energy, setting off a new high tide of increasing production and practicing economy. Most of the heroes who participated in the National Congress of Heroes have returned to their work posts. The communist style and advanced production technology of the heroes are being sown like seeds to the east, west, north, and south of the country, making the rising mass movement even higher. These seeds, after being cultivated by the broad masses, will surely grow and thrive, and will surely bloom brightly and bear rich fruits in the future. This special page we have compiled is precisely to reflect and promote the current sowing work.

    编后小语
    目前全国的生产形势极为良好，广大人民在党的八届八中全会的精神鼓舞下，正在反右倾、鼓干劲，掀起一个新的增产节约运动的高潮。参加全国群英会的英雄们大多数已经回到了工作岗位，英雄们的共产主义风格和生产技术上的先进经验，正像种子一样撒播到全国的东西南北，使正在高涨的群众运动更为高涨。这些种子，经过广大群众的耕耘，必将成长、茁壮，在今后必将普遍地开出鲜艳的花朵，结出丰硕的果实。我们编的这个专页，正是为了反映和推动目前的播种工作的。
