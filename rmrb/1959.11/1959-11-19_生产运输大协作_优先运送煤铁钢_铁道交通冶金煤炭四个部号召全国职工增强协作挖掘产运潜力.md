Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The four ministries of Railways, Communications, Metallurgy, and Coal, together with the Central People's Broadcasting Station, jointly held a large-scale collaboration broadcast conference in Beijing on the afternoon of the 17th. The conference called on workers in the four systems to hold high the red flag of the General Line, further enhance socialist collaboration, tap transportation and production potential, and fulfill this year's production and transportation plans ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment. The representatives of the sixty-four advanced collectives from these four systems attending the National "Conference of Heroes" put forward a joint initiative on further enhancing socialist collaboration at the meeting.

Over ten million workers in the national railway, communications, metallurgy, and coal mine systems listened to the live broadcast of the conference. "Efficiency through collaboration!" "Collaboration is strength!" "Leave the difficulties to ourselves, and give the convenience to others!" "Overcome the severe cold and complete this year's production and transportation tasks ahead of schedule!" These bold words spread to every corner of the country through powerful radio waves.

Vice Premier of the State Council Bo Yibo spoke at the conference. He said that the large-scale collaboration between production and transportation departments is a product of the Great Leap Forward in the national economy and a very valuable creation of advanced collectives and advanced producers on the industrial and transportation fronts. The joint initiative put forward by the representatives of advanced collectives from the four departments of railways, communications, metallurgy, and coal to further enhance socialist collaboration is an initiative with important economic and political significance.

After describing the current tasks on the national industrial, agricultural, and financial and trade fronts, Vice Premier Bo Yibo requested all workers on the transportation front to transport all the materials necessary for industry, agriculture, and finance and trade to their destinations. The current priority is to complete the transportation of coal and other major materials and to carry out the mass short-distance transportation movement in depth. Bo Yibo said that in the movement, the issue of how short-distance transportation can be sustained should be addressed immediately. This requires: first, the establishment, improvement, and equipping of the professional transportation teams and sideline transportation teams of the people's communes; second, the strengthening of local transportation construction; third, the continued vigorous technical innovation of transportation tools; fourth, the establishment and improvement of transportation leading bodies in counties and people's communes to strengthen the regular leadership of transportation work.

Bo Yibo said that in order to complete the current heavy transportation tasks, it is necessary to strengthen the collaboration between various departments of the national economy. Because any enterprise needs the transportation department to deliver raw materials in a timely manner in order to carry out production; the products they produce must also be delivered to consumers through transportation. Therefore, transportation is a continuation of production in the circulation process. Only by strengthening collaboration between the transportation department and other departments of the national economy can we further promote the development of production and complete the increasing transportation tasks.

Li Jiebo, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the meeting. He said that the joint initiative to further enhance socialist collaboration is of great significance for ensuring the completion of coal and steel transportation and production tasks. He called on workers in the national railway, transportation, metallurgy, and coal mine systems to respond to and thoroughly implement this initiative, continue to promote the spirit of collaboration, and vigorously promote and develop collaboration experience.

Vice Minister of Railways Yu Guangsheng, Vice Minister of Communications Ma Huizhi, Vice Minister of Metallurgical Industry Yuan Baohua, and Vice Minister of Coal Industry Zhao Zishang all spoke at the meeting. They introduced the achievements and experiences of these departments in enhancing large-scale transportation collaboration and its great significance for the continued leap forward in China's national economy. They explained that the close collaboration between transportation departments, between industrial departments, and between production, transportation, and sales departments has greatly accelerated the turnover of vehicles and ships, promoted the production of factories and mines, exerted tremendous material strength, and promoted the continued leap forward of China's national economy. From August 1958 to the present, the average daily number of wagons loaded by the national railway has increased by 13,000, which is equal to 81% of the total increase in the nine years before August 1958, of which three-quarters were achieved by relying on the whole Party and the whole people to run the railway, vigorously carrying out socialist collaboration, vigorously carrying out mass movements, and improving transportation organization. Due to the large-scale collaboration between the railway transportation department and the coal industry department, the national coal transported in the third quarter alone reached 2.73 million tons.

Representatives from fourteen units in the railway, transportation, metallurgy, and coal mine systems spoke at the broadcast conference.

The representatives of the three railway bureaus of Shenyang, Jinzhou, and Beijing unanimously expressed in their speeches that they would further strengthen collaboration with factories, mines, and ports, and resolutely achieve increased steel and coal production and increased railway transportation. The representative of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau proposed that the workers of Fuxin Station and Fuxin Coal Mine, who pioneered road-mine collaboration, should take measures such as vigorously building high platforms, low cargo positions, and simple coal storage sheds to completely resolve the contradictions between transportation and production imbalances, so as to achieve "being able to produce even if cars don't come for three days, and being able to load cars even if there is no production for three days."

The representatives of the Hebei Provincial Department of Transportation, Dalian Port Authority, and Nanjing Port Authority introduced in their speeches the effectiveness, experience, and future measures to further strengthen collaboration in their "one-dragon" transportation collaboration. After the experience of road-port collaboration created by Qinhuangdao Port Authority and Qinhuangdao Station in Hebei Province and the experience of "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration between production, transportation, and sales created by Changli County in Hebei Province were promoted throughout the province, the relationship between production, transportation, and sales became as close as a family, the organization and planning of transportation work were greatly strengthened, and vehicle and ship efficiency was unprecedentedly improved.

The representatives of the Transportation Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the Transportation Department of Benxi Iron and Steel Company and Benxi Station, as well as the Transportation Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company and Qifufen Station of Taiyuan Railway Bureau, warmly responded to the initiative on enhancing socialist collaboration on behalf of the workers of their enterprises at the conference. They proposed that they should achieve quick unloading and loading, non-stop wheels, no backlog of goods, and transportation as soon as production occurs, to support the continued leap forward of industry and agriculture. The representative of the Transportation Department of Angang proposed that they should strengthen the organization of transportation, implement planned transportation with fixed points, fixed train numbers, fixed quantities, and fixed directions, and increase the load capacity of vehicles by 10% to 15%.

The representatives of Fuxin, Fushun, and Datong Mining Bureaus proposed in their speeches that they should further promote large-scale transportation collaboration on the basis of road-mine unity, unified thinking, and unified command, to ensure the comprehensive completion of loading and unloading tasks. The vehicle turnover rate in the fourth quarter should be increased by more than 20% compared with the third quarter; the load capacity of vehicles and the number of direct trains should also be further increased.

    生产运输大协作　优先运送煤铁钢
    铁道交通冶金煤炭四个部号召全国职工增强协作挖掘产运潜力
    新华社18日讯　铁道、交通、冶金、煤炭四个部和中央人民广播电台17日下午在北京联合举行了大协作广播大会。大会号召四个系统的职工高举总路线的红旗，进一步增强社会主义大协作，挖掘运输、生产潜力，提前和超额完成今年的生产和运输计划。这四个系统出席全国“群英会”的六十四个先进集体的代表，在会上提出了关于进一步增强社会主义大协作的联合倡议。
    全国各地铁路、交通、冶金和煤矿系统有一千万名以上的职工，收听了大会的实况广播。“向协作要效率！”“协作就是力量！”“把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人！”“战胜严寒提前完成今年生产运输任务！”等豪迈的语言，通过强有力的电波，传播到了全国各个角落。
    国务院副总理薄一波，在大会上讲了话。他说，生产部门和交通运输部门大协作，这是国民经济大跃进的产物，是工业交通战线上的先进集体和先进生产者一个非常可贵的创造。铁路、交通、冶金、煤炭四个部门的先进集体代表提出的进一步增强社会主义大协作的联合倡议，是一个具有重要的经济意义和政治意义的倡议。
    薄一波副总理讲述了目前全国工业战线、农业战线和财贸战线上的任务以后，要求交通运输战线上的全体职工，把工业、农业、财贸各个方面必需运输的物资，全部运出来，运到目的地。当前特别重要的是要完成煤炭及其他主要物资的运输，深入地开展群众短途运输运动。薄一波说，在运动中，现在就应该立即动手解决短途运输怎样才能持续下去的问题。这就要求：第一，把人民公社的专业运输队和副业运输队建立、健全和装备起来；第二，加强地方交通的建设；第三，继续大闹运输工具的技术革新；第四，成立和健全县和人民公社的运输领导机构，加强对运输工作的经常领导。
    薄一波说，为了完成当前繁重的运输任务，必须加强国民经济各个部门的协作。因为任何企业要进行生产，都需要运输部门及时地运到原材料；他们生产出来的产品，也都要通过运输才能送到消费者的手上。所以运输是生产在流通过程中的继续。运输部门和国民经济其它部门只有加强协作，才能进一步促进生产的发展，才能完成日益增长的运输任务。
    中华全国总工会副主席李颉伯在会上讲话。他说，进一步增强社会主义大协作的联合倡议，对于保证完成煤炭和钢铁的运输、生产任务，都有重大的意义。他号召全国铁路、交通、冶金和煤矿系统的职工响应和彻底实现这个倡议，继续大兴协作之风，大力推广和发展协作经验。
    铁道部副部长余光生、交通部副部长马辉之、冶金工业部副部长袁宝华和煤炭工业部副部长赵子尚，都在会上讲了话。他们介绍了这些部门增强运输大协作的成就、经验及其对我国国民经济继续跃进的重大意义。他们说明全国交通运输部门之间、工业部门之间以及产、运、销部门之间亲密无间的大协作，大大加速了车、船周转，促进了厂矿生产，发挥出了巨大的物质力量，促进了我国国民经济的继续跃进。从1958年8月份到现在，全国铁路每天平均装车数增长了一万三千车，等于1958年8月份以前九年增长总数的81％，其中四分之三是由于依靠全党全民办铁路、大搞社会主义协作、大搞群众运动和改善运输组织工作取得的。由于铁路运输部门和煤炭工业部门大协作，全国第三季度多运的煤炭就达二百七十三万吨。
    铁路、交通、冶金和煤矿系统的十四个单位派来的代表，在广播大会上发了言。
    沈阳、锦州、北京等三个铁路局的代表在发言中一致表示要进一步加强同工厂、矿山、港口的协作，坚决做到钢煤增产，铁路增运。锦州铁路局的代表提出，首创路矿协作的阜新车站和阜新煤矿的职工，要采取大力修建高站台、低货位和简易储煤仓等办法，彻底解决运输和生产之间不平衡的矛盾，做到“三天不来车也能生产，三天不生产也能装车”。
    河北省交通厅、大连港务局和南京港务局的代表，在发言中介绍了他们开展“一条龙”运输大协作的成效、经验和今后进一步加强协作的措施。河北省秦皇岛港务局和秦皇岛车站创造的路港协作的经验和河北省昌黎县创造的产、运、销“一条龙”大协作的经验，在全省各地推广以后，产、运、销之间的关系亲如一家，运输工作的组织性和计划性大为加强，车船效率空前提高。
    鞍山钢铁公司运输部、本溪钢铁公司运输部和本溪车站，以及太原钢铁公司运输部和太原铁路局七府坟车站的代表，代表本企业的职工在大会上热烈响应关于增强社会主义大协作的倡议。他们提出，要做到快卸快装、车不停轮、货不积压、随产随运，支援工农业的继续跃进。鞍钢运输部的代表提出，要加强运输的组织工作，实行定点、定车次、定量、定方向的有计划运输，把车辆的载重量提高10％到15％。
    阜新、抚顺和大同矿务局的代表在发言中提出，要在路矿一家、统一思想、统一指挥的基础上，进一步大搞运输大协作，保证全面地完成装卸车的任务。第四季度的车辆周转率要比第三季度提高20％以上；车辆的载重量和直达列车的车次也要进一步增加。
