Listening to the Heroes Speak

	Louder than a gold-cast bell, every word is a shining material force. I see the strides of mountains, the dance of the sea, the whole of China flashing its wings in their voices. Only the rhythm of steel and electricity can express the language of 600 million people. Your voices have turned into a raging fire of enthusiasm, the sky filled with red clouds! I see the Republic standing before the podium, blowing the horn: Singing loudly the triumphal song of the Great Leap Forward, forward! Forward!

    听英雄们发言
    郭煌比金铸的洪钟还要响亮，每句话都是发光的物质力量，我看见了山的阔步，海的舞姿，整个中国在语音里闪着翅膀。钢和电的节奏才能表达六亿人的语言，你们的声音化成了干劲的烈火，红霞满天！我看见共和国站在讲台前吹号：高唱着跃进的凯歌，向前！向前！
