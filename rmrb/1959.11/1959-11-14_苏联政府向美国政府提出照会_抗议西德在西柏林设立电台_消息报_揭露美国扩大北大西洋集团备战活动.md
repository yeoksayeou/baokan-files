Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th - TASS Moscow, 12th: The Soviet government has lodged a protest with the US government against West Germany's establishment of "Deutschlandfunk" radio station in West Berlin.

    The protest states that the decision of the Federal Republic of Germany is illegal because it contradicts the existing status of West Berlin.

    The protest points out that the West German government's preparation to establish a radio station in West Berlin is nothing more than intensifying subversive activities and hostile propaganda from West Berlin. The purpose of West Germany establishing a radio station in West Berlin, in the center of another country, is clearly to intensify hostile activities against the German Democratic Republic.

    The protest emphasizes that the Soviet government considers the above-mentioned action of the West German government to be a new provocation aimed at aggravating the situation in Berlin and the whole of Germany, and inciting the "Cold War" in the center of Europe.

    The protest states that at a time when the talks between Khrushchev and Eisenhower have created more favorable preconditions for reaching an agreement on the West Berlin issue, this action by the Federal Republic of Germany can only be seen as a deliberate attempt to obstruct the success of the upcoming negotiations on the Berlin issue.

    The Soviet government expects the US government, as well as the British and French governments, to jointly take the necessary measures to stop the West German authorities from carrying out such illegal activities in West Berlin. The Soviet government has also sent similar protests to the governments of Britain and France.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th - The Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" published a commentary on the 12th, pointing out that a movement is currently underway in the United States and Western Europe to vigorously strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The speech made by former US Secretary of State Acheson at the so-called "German-American Conference" held in Bad Godesberg (West Germany) in October was a sign of the beginning of this movement. In this speech, Acheson clamored for "intensifying and expanding" NATO's war preparations. US official institutions and some military and political leaders have also issued the same calls. US Secretary of Defense McElroy demanded that the arms race not be relaxed for even a minute. He received the support of the Supreme Commander of NATO's Armed Forces in Europe, US General Norstad. NATO Secretary-General Spaak echoed the old tunes of McElroy and Norstad.

    The article points out that the aggressive bloc has put forward various plans to "strengthen" and "perfect" NATO. Among them is the establishment of a so-called expanded "Atlantic Community" to strengthen NATO, requiring neutral countries such as Austria, Sweden, and Switzerland, and other countries to send representatives to participate in this organization. "Izvestia" pointed out that this kind of scheme is not new, and the real reason why NATO's advocates are now playing this trick is very clear.

    苏联政府向美国政府提出照会
    抗议西德在西柏林设立电台
    “消息报”揭露美国扩大北大西洋集团备战活动
    新华社莫斯科13日电　塔斯社莫斯科12日电：苏联政府向美国政府提出一项照会，抗议西德在西柏林设立“德意志广播电台”。
    照会中说，德意志联邦共和国的这个决定是非法的，因为它是和西柏林的现有地位抵触的。
    照会中指出，德意志联邦共和国政府准备在西柏林设立广播电台这无非是要从西柏林加紧进行颠覆活动和敌对宣传。西德在西柏林、在另一个国家的中心设立广播电台的目的显然是要加紧对德意志民主共和国进行敌对活动。
    照会中强调指出，苏联政府认为，德意志联邦共和国政府上述行动是一次新的挑衅，其目的是加剧柏林和整个德国的局势，在欧洲中心煽动“冷战”。
    照会中说，在赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔会谈已经创造了较有利的前提来就西柏林问题达成协议的时候，德意志联邦共和国的这种行动只能被看作是蓄意阻挠就柏林问题将要举行的谈判获得成功。
    苏联政府期望美国政府以及英国和法国政府共同采取必要的措施，来制止德意志联邦共和国当局在西柏林进行这种非法活动。苏联政府也向英、法两国政府提出了同样的照会。
    新华社莫斯科13日电　苏联“消息报”12日发表评论指出，最近在美国和西欧正在进行一个竭力加强北大西洋公约组织的活动的运动。美国前国务卿艾奇逊10月间在巴特格德斯堡（西德）举行的所谓“德美会议”上的讲话就是这一运动开始的标志。艾奇逊在这次讲话中叫嚣“加紧扩大”北大西洋公约组织的备战活动。美国官方机构和一些军政负责人也发出了同样的叫嚷。美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊要求一分钟也丝毫不要放松军备竞赛。他得到了北大西洋集团驻欧洲武装部队总司令、美国将军诺斯塔德的支持。北大西洋公约组织秘书长斯巴克重弹了麦克耳罗伊和诺斯塔德的老调。
    文章指出，侵略集团提出了各种“加强”和“完备”北大西洋集团的方案。其中，包括为加强北大西洋公约组织而建立所谓扩大了的“大西洋共同体”，要奥地利、瑞典、瑞士这样一些中立国家和其他国家派代表参加这个组织。“消息报”指出，这种方案并不新鲜，而且北大西洋集团的鼓吹者现在玩弄这种手腕的真正原因是很明显的。
