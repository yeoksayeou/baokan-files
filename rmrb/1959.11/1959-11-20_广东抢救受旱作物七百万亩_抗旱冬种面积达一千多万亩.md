Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th: Farmers in various parts of Guangdong Province are intensifying the harvesting of late rice while engaging in a tense battle against the severe drought that has persisted for nearly two months, vigorously carrying out winter planting and rescuing autumn-sown crops.

Since mid-to-late September, drought conditions have occurred successively in various parts of the province. In October, except for small rainfalls of less than ten millimeters in some areas along the Zhanjiang and Dongjiang Rivers, most areas had basically no rain. Since November, except for medium rains of up to several tens of millimeters in individual areas of Lian County, Gaozhou, Leibei, and Dongfang Counties, and light rains of less than five millimeters in some areas, most areas have had basically no rain. Due to the wide range and long duration of the drought, the area of drought-stricken crops in the province has continued to expand. According to recent incomplete statistics, the area of drought-stricken crops in the province has reached more than eight million mu.

From the end of September to late October, various localities mobilized more than 2 million people every day, persevering day and night in fighting the drought. After a month of arduous struggle, more than 7 million mu of the 8 million mu of drought-stricken crops were rescued. Since November, although late rice has generally matured, relieving the threat of drought, other grain crops and cash crops still need to be continuously protected from drought. In order to ensure a bumper harvest of these crops, various localities have simultaneously carried out a tense drought-fighting campaign amid the busy autumn harvest, diverting water, operating waterwheels, scooping water, and carrying water to irrigate drought-stricken crops. Currently, the vast majority of autumn-sown miscellaneous grain crops and cash crops have been irrigated and are growing well.

While busily harvesting the autumn crops, various localities have launched a high tide of drought-resistant planting of winter crops. As of November 15, the province had rushed to plant more than 10 million mu of winter crops. In the drought-resistant rush planting, various localities also implemented simultaneous planting and management to prevent the planted crops from being threatened by drought. In Raoping County, Shantou Prefecture, all communes have universally organized special personnel to be responsible for the drought resistance work of winter crops, so that the planted winter crops are promptly irrigated.

    广东抢救受旱作物七百万亩
    抗旱冬种面积达一千多万亩
    据新华社广州18日电　广东省各地农民在加紧抢收晚稻的同时，和延续将近两个月的严重干旱进行紧张斗争，大力进行冬种和抢救秋种作物。
    全省各地自9月中、下旬开始，先后发生旱象。10月份除湛江和东江沿海部分地区下过十毫米以下的小雨之外，绝大部分地区基本没有下雨。11月份以来，除连县、高州、雷北、东方等县的个别地区下过几十毫米以下的中雨和部分地区下过五毫米以下的微雨之外，大部分地区基本无雨。由于干旱范围广、延续时间长，全省受旱作物面积不断扩大，据最近的不完全统计，全省受旱作物面积达八百多万亩。
    各地在9月底至10月下旬这一段时间，每天出动二百多万人，日夜坚持抗旱。经过一个月的艰苦战斗，在八百多万亩受旱作物中，有七百多万亩得到了抢救。11月份以来，晚稻虽已普遍成熟，解除了旱患威胁；但其他粮食作物和经济作物还需要继续抗旱。各地为了保证这些作物丰收，在秋收大忙中，同时进行了紧张的抗旱斗争，引水、车水、戽水、挑水灌溉受旱作物。现在，秋种杂粮作物和经济作物绝大部分获得灌溉，生长情况良好。
    各地在秋收大忙的同时，掀起了抗旱抢种冬季作物的高潮，到11月15日止，全省已抢种冬种作物一千多万亩。各地在抗旱抢种中，还实行边种边管，使种下的作物不受旱患威胁。汕头专区饶平县各公社，普遍组织专人负责冬种作物的抗旱工作，使已种下的冬种作物及时的得到了灌溉。
