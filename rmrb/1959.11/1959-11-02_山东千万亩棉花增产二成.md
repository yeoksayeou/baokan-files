Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, November 1st: Shandong Province has achieved a bumper harvest of cotton on over ten million mu of land. According to actual yields from various regions, the province's average yield per mu is expected to increase by about 20% compared to the bumper harvest of last year. In addition, according to incomplete statistics, the province has also seen over two million mu of large-scale high-yield fields with yields of over 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. For example, Linqing City in the Luxi Plain has 450,000 mu of cotton, with an expected yield of 110 jin of ginned cotton per mu. As of October 29th, the average yield of ginned cotton already harvested was 63.8 jin per mu, which is more than 3 jin more than the 60 jin per mu achieved in the bumper year of 1958. It is estimated that more than 46 jin of ginned cotton can still be harvested per mu.

The bumper cotton harvest in Shandong is the result of implementing political command, launching mass movements, and the people's communes conscientiously implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." Cotton production in general areas started earlier than in previous years, was well-prepared, was sown in a timely manner, met specifications, and achieved full and strong seedlings. Subsequently, field management was strengthened in the early and middle stages, mass movements were launched to combat drought and irrigate cotton, protect buds and bolls, and vigorously promote autumn boll production. Key aspects such as protecting bolls, eliminating pests, cultivating, topdressing, and watering were firmly grasped, and a late-stage overproduction management competition movement was launched, ensuring this year's bumper harvest.

    山东千万亩棉花增产二成
    新华社济南1日电　山东省一千多万亩棉花大丰收。据各地实收情况，预计全省平均每亩产量可比大丰收的去年增产两成左右。此外，据不完全统计，全省还出现了亩产皮棉一百斤以上的大面积丰产田二百多万亩。如鲁西平原的临清市四十五万亩棉花，预计每亩可产皮棉一百一十斤。到10月29日的统计，平均每亩已收皮棉六十三点八斤，比大丰收的1958年亩产六十斤还多三斤多。预计每亩还能收皮棉四十六斤多。
    山东棉花大丰收，是实行政治挂帅、大搞群众运动和人民公社认真贯彻执行农业八字宪法的结果。一般地区的棉花生产都比往年动手早、准备足、播种适时、合乎规格要求，并达到了苗全苗壮。随后加强了前、中期田间管理，展开了抗旱浇棉、保蕾保铃和大抓秋桃增产的群众运动，还狠狠抓住了保桃、除虫、中耕、追肥、浇水等关键，展开了后期超产管理竞赛运动，保证了今年的大丰收。
