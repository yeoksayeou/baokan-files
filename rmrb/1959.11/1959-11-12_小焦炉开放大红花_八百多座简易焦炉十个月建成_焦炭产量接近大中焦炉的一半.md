Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: A large number of simple coke ovens, built across the country starting this spring, are shining brilliantly in metallurgical industrial production. Practice has proven that vigorously building simple coke ovens while constructing large and medium-sized modern coke ovens is a good way to develop China's coking industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

This year, China's iron and steel industry is continuing to leap forward on the foundation of last year's Great Leap Forward. Small iron-smelting furnaces are all over the country. To adapt to this new situation, this year's demand for coke is greater than last year's, and the scope of supply is also wider than last year's. Therefore, as early as the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry decided to build more than a thousand No. 2 simple coke ovens and several hundred No. 3 simple coke ovens in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, while constructing large and medium-sized coke ovens, to increase the production of metallurgical coke. By the end of October, more than eight hundred No. 2 simple coke ovens had been put into production, and several hundred were being heated or under construction; the construction of No. 3 simple coke ovens is in full swing, with dozens already put into production. Currently, the coke produced by simple coke ovens is approaching one-half of the coke produced by large and medium-sized coke ovens nationwide, supplying the iron-smelting needs of small blast furnaces in various regions.

According to the analysis of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the main advantages of simple coke ovens are: low investment, easy construction, and quick results. For example, the investment for each No. 2 simple coke oven is only about 90,000 yuan, and it can be built and producing coke in half a month. This batch of No. 2 and No. 3 simple coke ovens built across the country is planned to be fully put into production by the end of this year, and next year it can produce more than 13 million tons of coke, a figure equivalent to the annual output of thirty 65-hole large coke ovens. If only the method of building large coke ovens is adopted, according to this year's construction speed, it would take about three years to build thirty large coke ovens; the construction investment would also be more than twice that of building these simple coke ovens. In addition, these simple coke ovens are mostly located near small blast furnaces and coal mines, which not only adapts to the scattered layout of small blast furnaces but also makes full use of the decentralized coking coal resources.

Some people once doubted whether simple coke ovens could achieve high production and high quality, and some even wavered about building simple coke ovens. However, the production situation in the past few months has fully proven that this doubt is superfluous. The vast majority of the more than eight hundred No. 2 simple coke ovens that have been put into production in various regions have reached or exceeded the designed capacity of producing 15 tons of coke per day. According to the chemical analysis of the coking branch of the Shijiazhuang Power Plant, the strength, ash content, sulfur content, and coking time indicators of the coke produced by the No. 2 simple coke ovens are all close to those of coke from large coke ovens.

    小焦炉开放大红花
    八百多座简易焦炉十个月建成
    焦炭产量接近大中焦炉的一半
    据新华社11日讯　全国各地今年春天开始兴建的一大批简易炼焦炉，在冶金工业生产中大放光彩。实践证明：在建设大、中型现代化炼焦炉的同时，大力兴建简易焦炉，是多快好省地发展我国炼焦工业的一条好途径。
    今年我国钢铁工业在去年大跃进的基础上继续跃进。炼铁小高炉遍布全国。适应这一新的形势，今年焦炭的需要量比去年多，供应范围也比去年广。因此，早在今年年初，冶金工业部就决定在建设大中型炼焦炉的同时，在各省、市、自治区建设一千多座二号简易焦炉和几百座三号简易焦炉，增产冶金焦炭。到10月底止，二号简易焦炉已经有八百多座投入生产，几百座正在烘炉或施工；三号简易焦炉的建设工程正在全面施工，已经有数十座投入生产。目前，由简易焦炉生产出来的焦炭，已经接近全国大中型焦炉所产焦炭的二分之一，源源供应了各地小高炉的炼铁需要。
    据冶金工业部分析，简易焦炉的主要优点是：投资省、建设易、收效快。例如二号简易焦炉，每座的投资只有九万元左右，半个月就可以建成出焦。全国各地兴建的这一批二号和三号简易焦炉，计划在今年年底全部投入生产，明年就可以生产一千三百万吨以上的焦炭，这个数字等于三十座六十五孔的大型炼焦炉一年的产量。如果只采取建设大型焦炉的办法，按照今年的建设速度，三十座大型焦炉约需三年时间才能建成；建设投资也要比建设这些简易焦炉多一倍以上。此外，这些简易焦炉大都靠近小高炉和煤矿，既同小高炉星罗棋布的布局相适应，又可以充分利用分散的炼焦煤资源。
    曾经有人怀疑简易炼焦炉能不能达到高产优质，有人甚至对兴建简易炼焦炉发生过动摇。但是，几个月以来的生产情况完全证明了，这种怀疑是多余的。各地已经投入生产的八百多座二号简易焦炉，绝大多数都达到或超过了日产十五吨焦炭的设计能力。据石家庄动力厂炼焦分厂的化验分析，二号简易焦炉焦炭的强度、灰份、硫份含量和结焦时间等指标，都接近大型焦炉的焦炭。
