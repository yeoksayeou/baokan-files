Xinhua News Agency, November 29th – The Algerian National Liberation Front's organ, "El Moudjahid," stated in a recent editorial, "It is clear that the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic, which leads the great struggle of the Algerian people, cannot order a ceasefire unless France puts forward sufficient guarantees.

    "Contrary intentions and expectations are a deliberate continuation of the war, thus revealing the true face before world opinion. The National Liberation Front possesses inexhaustible strength. The liberation war can be waged for as long as it needs to be. The National Liberation Front hopes that the French government will embark on the path of peace and realize the self-determination solemnly announced by France on September 16."

    "El Moudjahid," in its commentary on the Algerian Provisional Government's November 20th announcement regarding the appointment of Vice-Premier Ben Bella and four other Algerian leaders to negotiate with the French government on the conditions and guarantees for implementing self-determination, stated that the communiqué made it clear that negotiations should primarily discuss the means of implementing the right to self-determination. "There must be no ambiguity on this issue. If it is not a play on words, and if a ceasefire is not understood as surrender, then a ceasefire should be the result of a preliminary agreement on the procedural issues for resolving the conflict, and not a ceasefire prior to that."

    The editorial pointed out that French-Algerian negotiations should delve into the practical ways for the Algerian people to exercise their right to self-determination. Regarding the issue of popular vote, the necessary and fundamental point is to create all the conditions for holding an honest and uncoerced referendum.

    The newspaper said that the five Algerian leaders, including Ben Bella, who were designated to hold talks with France, enjoy the complete trust of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic, the Algerian National Liberation Army, and the entire people. Although they are imprisoned by France, this does not diminish their representativeness in the slightest, nor does it diminish their qualification to carry out the tasks entrusted to them. Any denial of their qualifications, under whatever pretext, is an untenable excuse.

    "El Moudjahid" also published an editorial on November 1st (the fifth anniversary of the Algerian people's uprising) stating that the main characteristic of the Algerian struggle is armed struggle, and Algeria should use armed struggle to achieve national independence.

    The editorial pointed out that for countries like Algeria, "when all legal means have been exhausted to no avail, and when colonialism is impervious to reason, it becomes a historical necessity to achieve national independence through armed struggle."

    The editorial said that the Algerian people's heroic resistance has been going on for five years. "For the Algerian people, these five years are a great victory they have reason to be proud of, while for French colonialism, it is a permanent and irreparable defeat."

    The editorial revealed that after de Gaulle's September 16th statement, some opportunists manipulated by the enemy were fabricating self-serving messages such as "France and the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic will soon reach an agreement" and "Although the war will continue, psychologically it has ended." The editorial pointed out that they "attempt to deceive world opinion and induce a wait-and-see attitude among the Algerian people, artificially creating an atmosphere of everything is fine and opportunism, from which the colonialists and their accomplices will benefit."

    The editorial also revealed that, with the same purpose in mind, some people say that the Algerian revolution has entered the so-called political stage, that the armed struggle has ended, and that if the armed struggle had not been launched, Algeria might have already achieved autonomy or independence. In refuting these malicious propagandas, the editorial said, "Although the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic favors peace, it does not favor peace at any cost."

    The editorial concluded, "The Algerian National Liberation Army remains the guarantee of our revolution, today and tomorrow. It will continue to act vigorously until the day the fundamental goals for which the Algerian people are fighting are achieved."

    阿尔及利亚“圣战者报”发表评论
    武装斗争是争取独立的必要手段
    在法国没有充分保证实现自治前决不停火
    新华社29日讯　阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线机关报“圣战者报”在最近一期的社论中说，“显然，领导阿尔及利亚人民的伟大斗争的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府，在法国没有提出充分保证的情况下，不能命令停火。
    “与此相反的打算和指望，就是蓄意继续进行战争，从而在世界舆论面前原形毕露。民族解放阵线拥有无穷的力量。解放战争需要打多久，就能进行多久。民族解放阵线希望法国政府走上和平的道路，实现法国9月16日庄严宣布的自决。”
    “圣战者报”在它这篇评论阿尔及利亚临时政府在11月20日发表的关于任命本·贝拉副总理等五位阿尔及利亚领袖同法国政府谈判实行自决的条件和保证的公报的社论中说，这个公报已经说得很清楚，谈判应该主要讨论实施自决权利的办法。“在这个问题上，不允许有任何含糊。如果不是玩弄字句，如果不把停火理解为投降，那么，停火应该是就解决冲突的程序问题先行达成协议的结果，而不是停火在这之先。”
    社论指出，法国—阿尔及利亚的谈判应该深入讨论阿尔及利亚人民行使自决权的实际办法。关于人民投票问题，必要的和基本的一点是：为举行正直的、不受压制的公民投票创造一切条件。
    这家报纸说，被指派同法国会谈的本·贝拉等五位阿尔及利亚领袖得到阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府、阿尔及利亚民族解放军和全体人民的完全信任。虽然他们被法国所囚禁，可是这丝毫无损于他们的代表性，也丝毫无损于他们有资格执行他们所受到委托的任务。不论以何种借口否认他们的资格，都是站不住脚的遁词。
      “圣战者报”在11月1日（阿尔及利亚人民起义五周年）还发表社论说，阿尔及利亚斗争的主要特点是武装斗争，阿尔及利亚应该用武装斗争来取得民族独立。
    这篇社论指出，像阿尔及利亚这样的国家，“当用尽了合法手段而无济于事的时候，当殖民主义不可以理喻的时候，用武装斗争来取得民族独立，就成了历史的必然性。”
    社论说，阿尔及利亚人民英勇抗战已经进行了五年。“对阿尔及利亚人民来说，这五年是他们有理由引为自豪的一个伟大的胜利，而对法国殖民主义来说，这则是永久无法挽回的一场惨败。”
    社论揭露，在戴高乐9月16日的声明发表之后，一些受敌人操纵的混水摸鱼者大肆捏造“法国和阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府很快将达成协议”、“虽然战争还要继续进行，可是在心理上战争是结束了”这类别有用心的消息，社论指出，他们“企图迷惑世界舆论，在阿尔及利亚人民中引来观望情绪。人为地制造一种诸事大吉和机会主义的气氛，而从这一切获得益处的人将是殖民主义者及其同谋者。”
    社论还揭露，此外，有一些人怀着同样的目的，说什么阿尔及利亚革命已经进入所谓政治阶段，武装斗争已经结束，说什么如果没有发动武装斗争，阿尔及利亚可能早已获得自治或独立等。社论在驳斥这些恶意宣传时说，“虽然阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府赞成和平，可是它不赞成不惜一切代价换取和平。”
    社论最后说，“阿尔及利亚民族解放军仍然是我们革命的保证，今天是这样，明天还是这样。它将猛烈地继续行动，直至达到阿尔及利亚人民为之斗争的基本目标之日为止。”
