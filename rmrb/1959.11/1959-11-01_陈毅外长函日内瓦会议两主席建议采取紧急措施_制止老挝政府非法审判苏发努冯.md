Xinhua News Agency, October 31st: Foreign Minister Chen Yi of the People's Republic of China, regarding the Lao Kingdom government's announcement of its decision to illegally try Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, sent a letter to Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, the two co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina. He suggested that the Soviet and British governments, as the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference, immediately take emergency measures to stop the Lao Kingdom government from conducting the so-called "trial" of Prince Souphanouvong and others, and urge the Lao Kingdom government to restore their freedom in accordance with the Geneva Accords, in order to prevent further deterioration of the situation in Laos.

Vice Foreign Minister Zeng Yongquan and Director of the Department of West European Affairs Xu Dashen received Soviet Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to China, Antonov, and British Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to China, Steedman, on October 31st, and handed them Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter to the two co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference. The content of the letter is as follows:

It is reported that the Lao Ministry of Justice announced that the Lao Kingdom government has decided to try Prince Souphanouvong, the Lao Patriotic Front, and other leaders of the former Lao Fighting Units on the so-called charge of "conspiracy to commit treason." This is an act by the Lao Kingdom government to further undermine the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements.

Since February of this year, the Lao Kingdom government has continuously undermined the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. After announcing the abandonment of the Geneva Accords in February, it launched an armed attack on the former Lao Fighting Units in May, violating the Vientiane Agreements, thereby creating a tense situation in Laos. Now, the Lao Kingdom government is going to conduct a so-called "trial" of the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front and the former Lao Fighting Units. This is a further violation of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, because both agreements explicitly stipulate that the former Lao Fighting Units shall not be persecuted. It is clear that if this action of the Lao Kingdom government is not stopped, it will inevitably make the already tense situation in Laos even more tense, and it will inevitably block the path to a peaceful resolution of the Laotian issue, thereby leading the Laotian people to the disaster of civil war and placing Indochinese peace in an extremely dangerous situation.

China is a close neighbor of the Kingdom of Laos and a participant in the Geneva Accords. The Chinese government and the Chinese people cannot sit idly by and watch the situation in Laos deteriorate step by step. We firmly advocate that the Lao issue should be resolved through consultations between the Lao Kingdom government and the Lao Fighting Units, as well as relevant countries, on the basis of the Geneva Accords, in order to ease the tense situation in Indochina. At the same time, the International Commission for Laos, chaired by India, which is responsible for monitoring and supervising the implementation of the Geneva Accords, should also resume its activities as soon as possible, in order to facilitate the rapprochement between the two sides in Laos and the rational resolution of the Laotian issue. We believe that all countries participating in the Geneva Accords have a responsibility to strive to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos.

In the spirit of upholding the Geneva Accords and peace in Indochina, the Chinese government suggests that the Soviet government and the British government, as the two co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference, immediately take emergency measures to stop the Lao Kingdom government from conducting the so-called "trial" of Prince Souphanouvong and others, and urge the Lao Kingdom government to restore their freedom in accordance with the Geneva Accords, in order to prevent further deterioration of the situation in Laos.

    陈毅外长函日内瓦会议两主席建议采取紧急措施
    制止老挝政府非法审判苏发努冯
    坚决主张在日内瓦协议的基础上，通过老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方以及有关国家协商解决老挝问题，尽速恢复老挝国际委员会的活动，和缓印度支那紧张局势。
    新华社31日讯　中华人民共和国外交部部长陈毅就老挝王国政府宣布决定非法审判苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人员问题，致函关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的两位主席苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和英国外交大臣劳埃德，建议苏英两国作为日内瓦会议的主席国，立即采取紧急措施制止老挝王国政府对苏发努冯亲王等人进行所谓“审判”，并且促使老挝王国政府根据日内瓦协议恢复他们的自由，以防止老挝局势进一步恶化。
    中国外交部副部长曾涌泉和西欧司司长徐达深于10月31日分别接见了苏联驻华临时代办安东诺夫和英国驻华代办施棣华，向他们递交了陈毅外交部长给日内瓦会议两主席的信。信的内容如下：
    据老挝司法部宣布，老挝王国政府已经决定以所谓“阴谋叛国罪”对苏发努冯亲王、老挝爱国战线党和前寮国战斗部队其他领导人员进行审判。这是老挝王国政府进一步破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议的行为。
    今年2月以来，老挝王国政府连续地对日内瓦协议和万象协议进行破坏。它于2月间宣布废弃日内瓦协议以后，又于5月间违反万象协议向前寮国战斗部队发动武装进攻，从而造成了老挝的紧张局势。现在，老挝王国政府又要对老挝爱国战线党和前寮国战斗部队领导人员进行所谓“审判”，这是对日内瓦协议和万象协议的进一步破坏，因为这两个协议都明文规定不得对前寮国战斗部队进行迫害。很显然，如果老挝王国政府的这一行动不加以阻止，它将必然使已经紧张的老挝局势更加紧张起来，而且不可避免地将堵塞老挝问题和平解决的途径，从而把老挝人民引向国内战争的灾难，使印度支那和平处于极为危险的境地。
    中国是老挝王国的近邻和日内瓦协议的参加国。中国政府和中国人民不能坐视老挝的局势一步一步地恶化下去。我们坚决主张，在日内瓦协议的基础上，通过老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方以及有关国家的协商来解决老挝问题，以和缓印度支那的紧张局势；同时，负有监察和监督日内瓦协议的实施的、以印度为主席的老挝国际委员会也应该尽速恢复活动，以利于老挝双方的接近和老挝问题的合理解决。我们认为，所有参加日内瓦协议的国家，都负有责任为保证日内瓦协议在老挝的实施而努力。
    本着维护日内瓦协议和印度支那和平的立场，中国政府建议，作为日内瓦会议两主席的苏联政府和英国政府，立即采取紧急措施，制止老挝王国政府对苏发努冯亲王等人进行所谓“审判”，并且促使老挝王国政府根据日内瓦协议恢复他们的自由，以防止老挝局势进一步恶化。
