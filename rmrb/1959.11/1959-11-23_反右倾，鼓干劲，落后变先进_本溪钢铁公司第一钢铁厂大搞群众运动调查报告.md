    Anti-Rightist, Boost Morale, Turn Backwardness into Advancement
    Investigation Report on the Mass Movement at the No. 1 Steel Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company
    Liu Mingyi
    The No. 1 Steel Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company is an old factory with a history of over forty years. The factory has two medium-sized blast furnaces with a total volume of 657 cubic meters (No. 1 furnace is 333 cubic meters, No. 2 furnace is 324 cubic meters). In addition, there are workshops serving the blast furnaces, such as power generation, coking, sintering, and maintenance, but the equipment is relatively outdated and the workers' working conditions are poor.
    After liberation in 1949, the factory rapidly restored production and quickly exceeded the highest annual output during the Japanese puppet regime (156,000 tons in 1936). However, the factory's progress during the first Five-Year Plan was relatively slow. The blast furnace utilization coefficient remained at around 1.33 tons (iron production per cubic meter per 24 hours) for a long time, increasing by only 5% in five years. Major accidents such as "nodule formation" inside the furnace occurred several times each year. It was not until 1957 that this situation was reversed and the plan for increasing production and practicing economy was completed. At this time, a certain complacency arose among the cadres, who believed that they were not behind the brother factories, that the output had already exceeded the daily output during the puppet Manchurian regime by one time (the highest daily output during the puppet Manchurian regime was 400 tons, and in 1957 it had reached 800 tons), and that the potential had been almost fully tapped, making further improvement difficult. At the first national blast furnace conference convened by the Ministry of Metallurgy in Anshan in 1958, they were even prepared to introduce their experience. Later, after comparing themselves with brother factories, they realized that they were behind in many technical and economic indicators. For example, the blast furnace utilization coefficient of Daye Steel Plant was 1.540, while theirs was 1.316; the smelting intensity of Taiyuan Iron and Steel was 1.1, while theirs was 1.01; the coke ratio (coke consumption per ton of iron) of Anshan Iron and Steel was 650 kilograms, while theirs was 777 kilograms; and the production increase plan of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company proposed to increase by 14% at the beginning of that year, while theirs was only 5%. As they themselves said, "Seeing ourselves as advanced with the door closed, but backward when we open the door." This stark contrast was a great boost to them. After the meeting, the factory's leading comrades issued a call to the workers to "remove the backward label," which quickly became the unanimous demand of all workers in the factory. After the hard work of all the workers in every possible way, they finally created a new record of blast furnace utilization coefficient of 1.550 in April last year, and jumped to become a national red banner. Afterwards, it rose month by month, and the production level soared. In September, the utilization coefficient broke through the 2.0 mark, and in December it reached 2.265, with an annual average of 1.826, an increase of 38% compared with 1957. Pig iron production reached 426,000 tons, an increase of 33.7% compared with 1957. In early 1959, although the conditions changed somewhat, the raw material conditions were poor, spare parts were lacking, and some workers also developed a sense of relaxation, under the leadership of the Party committee, this situation was quickly reversed, the enthusiasm of the workers was mobilized, and objective difficulties were overcome, and the red flag was still held high to continue to move forward. The national plan was overfulfilled in the first half of 1959. In 1959, the blast furnace utilization coefficient also increased month by month. The average in the first half of the year was 2.268, which was 10% higher than the highest level last year. In August, a record of 2.415 was created, and from September 19 to 21, a new record of 3.062 was created for three consecutive days. The utilization coefficient of this national large and medium-sized blast furnace red banner factory, which has been maintained for one year and five months, is still the highest in the country. The furnace, which was once called old and toothless, has now truly regained its youth.
  Resolutely implement the General Line and constantly fight against Rightist thinking
    The rectification and anti-Rightist campaign in this factory was carried out relatively thoroughly. The double-anti (anti-waste, anti-conservatism) movement carried out at the beginning of last year was an even more intense ideological revolution. Through this ideological revolution, the relationship between leaders and the led was adjusted, and a close, comradely relationship was established between cadres and the masses; the broad masses of workers underwent a profound self-education on for whom they were working; in the movement to open their hearts to the Party, engineering and technical personnel also relatively thoroughly examined their bourgeois individualism. On the basis of greatly improving the ideological consciousness of all cadres and workers and their unprecedentedly high morale and enthusiasm for production, the factory's leadership promptly guided the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses to production, mobilized the masses to expose the reasons for backward production, and concentrated on criticizing Rightist conservative thinking. The promulgation of the Party's general line for socialist construction further greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, who established the advanced thinking of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. A high tide of the Great Leap Forward began to appear in production, and production targets were repeatedly broken. The annual plan was revised seven times, from 328,000 tons at the beginning of the year to 430,000 tons.
    Revising the annual plan targets was a serious struggle against Rightism and conservatism. When the masses discussed revising the plan, they often encountered obstruction from Rightist conservatives. The task set at the beginning of the year was 330,000 tons, but they only accepted 328,000 tons. Some people were full of worries, fearing that the plan would be set too high to be completed; fearing that the Great Leap Forward would bring imbalance and disrupt the so-called normal production order; complaining that the masses did not understand the overall situation and only acted on enthusiasm; saying that the masses would not be responsible if the plan could not be completed, while the leaders would have to make self-criticisms, and so on. They emphasized that the furnace was old, the equipment was outdated, and it would be good to maintain the status quo, and that further tapping potential would lead to danger. These people were actually opposed to the Great Leap Forward and were "status quo maintainers." However, the CCP Party Committee resolutely supported the advanced opinions of the masses and launched a struggle against the conservatives. Through big blooming, big contending, big-character posters, big debates, and practical actions to find ways to raise measures, they finally defeated the conservatives and won victory. After the Great Leap Forward plan was formulated, there were also sharp struggles in the process of implementation. The masses proposed the operational policy of improving smelting intensity (i.e., how much coke is consumed per cubic meter per 24 hours) and reducing coke ratio (coke consumption per ton of iron) simultaneously, which was opposed by "technical mystics" and "technical authorities." They believed that improving smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio were contradictory and could not be achieved at the same time. They said that before 1957, the furnace conditions were not good and nodules often formed because of the increase in smelting intensity. They stubbornly adhered to the "technical regulations" of "Anshan Iron and Steel Company" and believed that the smelting intensity could not be exceeded at all. Some even brought out a pile of American materials to prove the correctness of their conservative views during the debate. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the workers resolutely criticized this thought of seeing things but not people and the outdated viewpoints of dogmatism, and organized the masses to debate with them, refuting them by presenting facts and reasoning. At the same time, the factory's leadership sent people to other places to learn from the experience of blast furnace production, and organized leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and workers to establish a one-stop experimental field in the No. 1 blast furnace. After repeated research and multiple experiments, they quickly solved the practice of not daring to increase the blast temperature for a long time, raising the blast temperature from 750 degrees to 900 degrees, and carried out raw material screening work. In less than twenty days, significant results were achieved. The smelting intensity increased from 1.029 to 1.092, the coke ratio decreased from 723 kg to 668 kg, and the utilization coefficient increased from 1.368 to 1.655.
    This decisive victory not only shattered the conservatives with ironclad facts, but also fully proved that improving smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio were not only possible but also had great potential. This fact showed that the old furnace still had great potential. The factory's leading comrades and workers also realized that outdated equipment did bring many problems. But faced with this objective reality, should they reduce production and passively accommodate the old equipment, or actively maintain it and enable it to play a greater role? They resolutely adopted the latter approach. In order to maintain the blast furnace bell, the repair workers took turns going to the top of the furnace to check it, and immediately rushed to repair it as soon as they found a problem, until a new bell was replaced before they left. The same method was adopted for other equipment, doing everything possible to increase production. For example, among the fifty-two coke ovens, twenty-six had problems. Thanks to the good maintenance by the masses, not only was the output of coke increased, ensuring the supply of the blast furnace, but also the life of the coke oven was extended. The No. 1 blast furnace was originally scheduled to undergo a major overhaul this year, but in order to produce more pig iron, the factory conducted a strict assessment of the No. 1 blast furnace and asked Soviet experts to assist in the inspection. After the inspection, it was unanimously agreed that strengthening the maintenance of the furnace could postpone the major overhaul to next year. Therefore, after the factory's plan was implemented, the production task was increased from the originally planned 450,000 tons to 520,000 tons.
    Faced with the fact that the factory's production has been rising for more than a year, the Rightist conservatives had to admit defeat, but this does not mean that the struggle against Rightist thinking has stopped. Given the opportunity, Rightist conservative thinking will raise its head again. When the plan was implemented this year and the emphasis was placed on strengthening management, another ill wind appeared. Some people believed that the method of large enterprises engaging in mass movements was no longer effective, and they attempted to blame the problems on the mass movement. They wanted to simply restore the rules and regulations that had been broken, which restricted production, and go backwards. When discussing the plan, they always wanted to set the plan as low as possible. Under their influence, a considerable number of cadres and workers developed a rather serious sense of relaxation and blind optimism. The enthusiasm of the masses was also somewhat frustrated. However, these people were a minority after all. Because the broad masses of workers had improved their awareness through rectification and the study of the general line, especially because the Party's leadership was strengthened after rectification, the Rightist conservatives had no market in the factory. Under the correct leadership of the Party committee, the various arguments of the conservatives were quickly shattered.
    Experience proves that the Party's leadership must always pay attention to fighting against Rightist conservatives. The fact that this factory was able to achieve such brilliant results and timely refute and shatter the fallacies of the Rightist conservatives was a decisive factor.
        Mobilize the masses and launch a large-scale technical revolution
    Encouraged by the Party's general line, the broad masses of workers were all high-spirited and full of energy, and offered suggestions one after another. Many workshops and work sections saw the emergence of technical revolution committees and technical research groups automatically formed by the masses. Some workshops and work sections jointly formed technical revolution cooperatives, and a large number of activists in technical revolution and technical innovation emerged. In order to ensure that the blast furnace was well-fed, the raw material workers used manual screening methods to separate the sintered ore into large and small pieces. Meng Qingyi, a furnace front technician in the coking workshop, carried out technical reforms on many equipment, and everyone called him a "handyman." He created a method of spraying water glass and refractory mud mixed into the coke oven, which can extend the life of the furnace, and the experiment was successful. Jin Yanchun, a raw material worker, used various methods to experiment in order to study the equipment for automatic screening of raw materials. The young people of the No. 1 blast furnace (Youth Furnace) were even more enthusiastic about technical innovation. With the support of the Party committee, they broke the unreasonable and outdated regulations in May last year, worked hard for a week, broke the batch to 127 batches, and greatly improved the smelting intensity. As a result, they created new records 25 times in a row, revised the annual plan nine times, and increased production by 60,000 tons. It was precisely because of the full enthusiasm of all the workers and the success of technical innovation that the blast furnace utilization coefficient increased steadily.
    The old balance was broken, and many new problems emerged, such as the raw material conditions were not good enough; the hoist was slow, affecting the timely supply of the furnace; too much molten iron was produced, but the capacity of the pig casting machine was insufficient; the furnace temperature increased after the smelting intensity was improved, and so on. How should we deal with the new difficulties? The only way is to further guide the soaring enthusiasm of the masses to the large-scale technical revolution and technical innovation movement, and solve the key and weak links in production in a guided and planned way. The Party committee determined to organize all workshops and work sections in the factory with the blast furnace as the core to carry out communist large-scale cooperation and organize a new balance. Since last year, more than a dozen major technical measures have been implemented, such as: raw material screening, coke classification, increasing the iron content of iron powder, increasing the sintering alkalinity, expanding the diameter of the tuyere (from 130 mm to 180 mm), and the pelletizing machine that was recently put into production. Each major measure has brought great economic benefits. The first three items alone have increased the blast furnace output by about 30%. In leading the technical revolution and technical innovation movement, the Party committee implemented the following principles and practices:
    (1) The leaders come up with topics, and mobilize the masses to offer suggestions. The Party committee timely informs the masses of the key problems in production at each stage, asking the masses to use their brains to think of solutions, and then study and summarize the opinions of the masses into several different plans, and then hand them over to the masses for comparison and debate. For example, coke classification had been learned from brother factories in the past, but because only a few engineering and technical personnel were involved in research and experimentation, it had never been realized. After the repair workshop raised this topic this time, the masses posted more than 70 big-character posters. The leaders summarized them into three plans: the first was to work hard, repair the ore trough, and build the factory building; the second was to only repair the ore trough and extend the original two conveyor belts without building the factory building; and the third was to only install a vibrating screen. After repeated debate and comparison, the third plan was adopted. Because a large amount of old and waste materials were used in the manufacturing equipment and construction, the project only cost 500 yuan, and the construction period only took nine hours. This one item alone increased the blast furnace output by 8%. The Party committee uses the leadership method of coming from the masses and going to the masses, combined with experimental research on production technology, to implement each major measure. Doing so has a profound impact on the education of engineering and technical personnel, enabling them to realize in actual struggle that scientific research must implement the mass line. Doing so can also promote the masses to learn technology; it is also the best way to realize the three-way combination of leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and workers.
      (2) Implement the policy of walking on two legs - combining foreign and indigenous methods. The main reason why many important measures can be realized in a short period of time is that the policy of combining foreign and indigenous methods has been resolutely implemented. They do not blindly pursue foreign methods, but rather make do with simple means, make use of waste materials, and strive for self-reliance. Many technical measures have been achieved through arduous exploration and repeated experiments. For example, in order to further improve the raw material conditions, the spherical pelletizing equipment built this year (the advantage is that the particles are uniform, the air permeability is good, the reducibility is good, and the regenerated powder is less) was all designed and drawn by the workers themselves, and most of it was manufactured and installed by themselves using existing materials.
    (3) Both boldly innovate and create, and go through all tests. The operational policy of improving smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio simultaneously, which they began to implement last year, was a bold attempt. It is not only a major issue that has been debated for a long time in ironmaking production, but no one is sure what will happen if it is implemented in this old furnace. The method they adopted was to first concentrate the main forces on the No. 1 blast furnace for experimentation, and after success, successively implement it in the No. 2 blast furnace in a prepared manner. For example, the measures of adopting an enlarged tuyere diameter and changing the tuyere water pipe to top-in, bottom-out, double-in, and single-out in order to strengthen the cold water pressure were also successfully tested on one tuyere before being widely promoted. In this way, both technical innovation and production improvement were carried out, and safety was ensured.
      Vigorously grasp the red flag competition and encourage the masses to move forward
    Under the constant education of the factory Party committee, the Party's general line for socialist construction has been mastered by the masses and has been transformed into a great material force. The workers are working selflessly with great momentum. For example, the repair workers reinforced the blast furnace top protection plate. In the past, it generally took 32 hours to overhaul and repair the furnace. Since the Great Leap Forward, in order not to affect production, the workers rushed to repair the furnace without shutting it down. After the person operating on the top of the furnace was fainted by the smoke, another person immediately took over. In particular, in September last year, when the No. 2 blast furnace was about to tap iron, a water leakage accident suddenly occurred in the taphole. If the iron is not tapped on time, it will affect production and cause nodules to form inside the furnace; if the iron is tapped on time, there is a risk of explosion, which threatens the safety of the entire factory. The situation was extremely urgent. Furnace front technician Comrade Sun Fucai (an old worker, a Communist Party member, and promoted to deputy director this year) stepped forward, risking his life, and relying on 30 years of experience, finally safely led the molten iron out. The miracles created by many heroic figures have set a good example among the masses. In order to better motivate the broad masses and give play to the role of advanced figures and advanced collectives, they vigorously organized the red flag competition movement. Over the past year, this movement has been carried out vigorously and vividly. Practice has proved that the red flag competition is the best way to organize mass production and mass self-education. Through this competition, all positive factors are fully mobilized, and through competition and evaluation, experience is summarized, work is improved, and the masses are educated to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and achieve mutual learning and common improvement.
    This factory launched a fraternal friendship competition with the No. 2 Iron Factory of the company and especially with the ironmaking plant of Taiyuan Iron and Steel. Their production levels are roughly the same, and they are often in a state of chasing each other and being indistinguishable. A slight negligence can lead to the risk of falling behind. The factory department publishes the battle situation of these three factories at the gate every day to let everyone understand the situation. The workers of the whole factory are always concerned about the battle situation of the three factories. After work, they always go to the blackboard to see their labor results and the situation of the brother factories. Many workers' families also joined the competition, helping to break the ore, and often running to see the battle situation and sending tea and food to their relatives. In the upper and middle of September last year, the factory neglected the principle of "attack when things are going smoothly, and stabilize when things are not going smoothly" in its operation, and production was once poor. As a result, the No. 2 Iron Factory ran ahead, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel also approached the level of the factory. The situation was very urgent. The factory Party committee mobilized the masses to launch a battle to protect the red flag. The workers spontaneously put forward the slogan of "working hard for ten days, competing with the No. 2 Iron Factory, surpassing Taiyuan Iron and Steel, and vowing to keep the red flag always leading." Many leading cadres and workers participated in the battle, and the office staff also participated in the rush to transport raw materials. Finally, four new records were created in late September, and the red flag was maintained. December is the key moment for the inter-factory competition to determine the outcome of the whole year, and the competition reached the most tense stage. In the first ten days of the month, Taiyuan Iron and Steel was the first, but the blast furnace utilization coefficient per cubic meter of volume only exceeded the factory by 70 kilograms of pig iron. In the face of a very tense situation, all the workers were radiant, full of fighting spirit, closely united, and supported each other. With the support and cooperation of other factories in the company, they created higher results. The blast furnace utilization coefficient reached a record of 2.265 for the whole month, and it was still the champion of large and medium-sized blast furnaces in the country.
    Intra-factory cooperation and competition is the foundation of inter-factory competition. Modern blast furnace production technology is very complex. It requires all workers to obey unified command, coordinate actions, and create conditions for each other, otherwise it is impossible to organize a production Great Leap Forward. In the battle to defend the red flag, under the slogan of "taking the blast furnace as the core and making an all-round leap forward," the factory Party committee vigorously organized the cooperation and competition among all workshops and work sections in the factory. The workshops submitted battle tables and guarantees to the blast furnace one after another, and took the initiative to put forward the slogan of "serving the blast furnace." The raw material work section proposed to ensure that the blast furnace "eats well and eats enough," and ensure that "the blast furnace does not wait for materials"; the powder of sintered ore decreased from 20% to 5%, and then to 2%; the pig casting machine workers learned to repair themselves in order to do a good job in maintenance and not delay production; the repair workshop proposed that production must not be delayed due to equipment problems, and the blast furnace workers proposed "never to fail everyone's support." In the past, it took 30 minutes to change the tuyere of the blast furnace, but now it only takes seven or eight minutes. The friendship competition between the No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces in the factory is also very intense. In January and February this year, the No. 2 blast furnace led, but in March it was taken over by the No. 1 blast furnace, and in April there were wins and losses, and at the end of the month, the No. 2 blast furnace was still leading. In late May, the conditions of the No. 1 blast furnace had not improved. In order to prevent the workers from developing impetuous emotions and discouraged thoughts, the No. 1 blast furnace proposed "the red flag will be temporarily lost in May, and it will be taken back in June." In order to encourage the workers to continue to work hard and avoid complacency, the No. 2 blast furnace proposed "there are many difficulties in June, and the red flag still belongs to me." At the same time, the workers of the two furnaces fully paid attention to supporting each other and working together to protect the factory's red flag. For example, in June, the raw materials of the No. 1 blast furnace were not supplied, and the material transportation team of the No. 2 blast furnace took the initiative to send five trucks of pellets. This new atmosphere of actively supporting others, regardless of each other, and not calculating rewards truly embodies the slogan that "competition is the opponent, and production is the comrade-in-arms" and the noble communist style.
      Strengthen the Party's leadership and give play to the role of various organizations
    The factory's ability to achieve such great achievements is the result of strengthening the Party's leadership and implementing politics in command in all activities. All cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and workers in the factory resolutely obey the Party's leadership and listen to the Party's words. The Party organization pays great attention to mastering the Party's policy on technical personnel, and implements the policy of actively transforming while paying attention to uniting and giving a free hand. For example, the foreman of the blast furnace duty room used to only be in charge of furnace records and had to ask the factory director for instructions on everything. After the appropriate decentralization of power, it was determined that the foreman could be responsible for handling temporary problems in the blast furnace (such as deciding on temporary shutdowns), which increased the foreman's sense of responsibility and prompted them to conscientiously study technology and rely on workers to master the furnace's production situation.
    In terms of leadership methods, the Party committee often adopts the method of breaking through key points to promote the overall situation and combining centralized leadership with giving play to the role of organizations. The Party committee can grasp the key problems and weak links in production at each stage and organize the main forces of the factory to solve them. The Party committee has in-depth discussions on the central work of each stage, unifies thoughts and understanding, and then implements the division of labor and responsibility and gives play to the role of various organizational systems. The factory's administrative management and technical management are relatively sound. In order to cooperate with the large-scale mass movement, they appropriately decentralized the technical management work to the workshops or work sections. This can not only give play to the enthusiasm of the masses, but also enable the leaders to consciously get rid of some administrative work and concentrate their energy on considering major issues. Although many rules and regulations have been broken, attention has also been paid to establishing some in a timely manner. The work of the Party branches is very active in the movement, and the vast majority of Party members are pioneers and backbones in the production leap forward. In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over important departments, the Party committee uniformly deployed outstanding Party members. For example, the blast furnace duty room is the place to control the lifeline of blast furnace production. At that time, there was only one Party member among the 17 deputy foremen. Since last year, six young worker Party members with a certain level of culture have been transferred in, and two Party members have been developed among the original foremen, and the political situation has been greatly changed. The trade union has played a good role in organizing the red flag competition and publicizing and promoting advanced experiences. The Communist Youth League mainly focuses on the Youth Furnace (No. 1 Blast Furnace) and organizing youth commando work, and also plays the role of the Party's assistant.
    As mentioned above, the Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant has maintained the national large and medium-sized blast furnace red banner factory for 17 months, which is not accidental. This is a product of the Party's general line for building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, going all out and aiming high. The experience of this factory proves that large-scale mass movements can and must be carried out in modern large enterprises. Only by relying on the broad masses can production leap forward and can the difficult problems in production be solved smoothly. Experience also proves that large-scale mass movements must be combined with the centralized and unified leadership in production. The factory's mass movement is prominent, but it is also the most orderly in production, and the production management work is also good. The workers of the whole factory not only have soaring enthusiasm, but also actively study technology, combining hard work with skillful work, and making the enthusiasm of the masses consolidated and lasting. The leadership of the factory Party committee is not only centralized and unified, but also has a division of labor and responsibility, not only has a center, but also has general, and provides valuable experience in the combination of politics and economics.

    反右倾，鼓干劲，落后变先进
    本溪钢铁公司第一钢铁厂大搞群众运动调查报告
    刘明义
    本溪钢铁公司第一钢铁厂，是一个有四十余年历史的老厂子。这个厂的两座中型高炉，总容积为六百五十七立方米（一号炉三百三十三立方米，二号炉三百二十四立方米）；此外，还有为高炉服务的发电、炼焦、烧结、检修等车间，但设备都比较陈旧，工人的劳动条件也较差。
    1949年解放以后，这个厂迅速的恢复了生产，并且很快就超过了日伪统治时期的最高的年产量（1936年十五点六万吨）。但是这个厂在第一个五年计划期间，进步却比较慢，高炉利用系数长期保持在一点三三吨（每一立方米一昼夜产铁量）左右，五年中只提高了5％。炉内“结瘤”的大事故，每年总要发生几次，直到1957年，才扭转了这种局面，完成了增产节约计划。也就在这个时候，干部中产生了一定的自满情绪，认为不比兄弟厂落后，产量已超过伪满日产量的一倍（伪满最高日产四百吨，1957年已达八百吨），潜力已经挖得差不多了，再提高也困难了。在1958年冶金部在鞍山召开的第一次全国高炉会议上，他们还准备介绍自己的经验。后来和兄弟厂子一比较，他们才发现自己在许多技术经济指标上落后了。比如高炉利用系数，大冶钢厂是1.540，他们是1.316；冶炼强度，太钢是1.1，他们是1.01；焦比（炼一吨铁所耗的焦炭）鞍钢是六百五十公斤，他们是七百七十七公斤；增产计划，石景山钢铁公司在该年年初就提出要提高14％，而他们只提高5％。这正如他们自己所说：“关着门看是先进，打开门看是落后”。这个鲜明的对比，对他们是一个很大的促进。会后，这个厂的领导同志向职工发出“摘掉落后帽子”的号召，很快就成为全厂职工的一致的要求。经过全厂职工千方百计的艰苦奋斗，终于在去年4月，创造了高炉利用系数1.550的新记录，一跃而成为全国的红旗。其后月月上升，生产水平扶摇直上，9月份利用系数突破了2.0的大关，12月达到了2.265，全年平均为1.826，比1957年提高了38％。生铁产量达到了四十二点六万吨，比1957年提高33.7％。1959年初，虽然条件有些变化，原料条件较差，备品备件缺乏，部分职工也产生了松劲情绪，但在党委领导下，很快扭转了这种局面，调动了职工的积极性，克服了客观困难，仍然高举红旗继续前进。使1959年上半年超额完成了国家计划。1959年，高炉利用系数也是月月提高的，上半年平均为2.268，比去年最高水平还高10％。8月又创造2.415的记录，9月19日到21日连续三天又创造3.062的新记录。这个坚持了一年零五个月的全国大中型高炉红旗厂的利用系数，目前仍居全国首位。那过去被人称为老掉牙的炉子，现在真正恢复了青春。
  坚决贯彻总路线，不断向右倾思想作斗争
    这个厂的整风反右进行得比较彻底，去年年初所进行的双反（反浪费、反保守）运动，更是一场激烈的思想革命。经过这次思想革命，调整了领导与被领导的关系，建立了干部与群众之间同志式的密切关系；在广大职工群众中，进行了深刻的为谁劳动的自我教育；在向党交心的运动中，工程技术人员也比较彻底地检查了资产阶级个人主义思想。在全厂干部和工人思想觉悟大大提高，心情舒畅和生产热情空前高涨的基础上，厂的领导，及时地把群众的革命热情引导到生产上，发动群众揭发生产落后的原因，集中地批判了右倾保守思想。党的社会主义建设总路线的公布，更大大地鼓舞了广大职工的热情，广大职工树立了鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省的先进思想，与敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格。生产上开始出现了大跃进的高潮，生产指标一再被突破，年度计划先后修改了七次，由年初的三十二点八万吨，提高到四十三万吨。
    修订年度计划指标，是一场反右倾、反保守的严重斗争。在群众讨论修订计划时，经常碰到右倾保守主义者的阻挠。年初规定的任务是三十三万吨，他们只接受三十二点八万吨。有些人顾虑重重，怕计划订高了完不成；怕跃进带来不平衡，打乱了所谓正常生产秩序；埋怨群众不了解全面情况，单凭热情办事；说完不成计划群众可以不负责，而领导则必须作检讨等等。他们强调：炉子老了，设备旧了，能维持现状就不错，再挖潜力就要出危险。这些人实际上是反对大跃进，是“现状维持派”。但是，中共党委坚决支持了群众的先进意见，向保守派展开了斗争，用大鸣大放大字报大辩论和想办法提措施的实际行动，终于战胜了保守派，赢得了胜利。跃进计划制定后，在执行的过程中，也有着尖锐的斗争。群众提出以提高冶炼强度（即一昼夜一个立方米消耗多少焦炭）与降低焦比（炼一吨铁所消耗的焦炭）双管齐下的操作方针，受到“技术神秘论者”和“技术权威者”的反对。他们认定提高冶炼强度和降低焦比是矛盾的，不可能二者兼得。他们说1957年以前炉况不好，时常结瘤，就是因为提高冶炼强度的结果。他们死抱着“鞍钢公司”的“技术规定”，认为冶炼强度一点不能超过。有的在辩论时甚至搬出一堆美国资料来证明自己保守观点的正确。在党委领导下，职工坚决地批判了这种见物不见人的思想和教条主义的陈旧观点，并组织群众同他们进行辩论，用摆事实、讲道理的方法驳倒他们。同时厂的领导一面派人到外地学习高炉生产经验，一面组织领导干部、工程技术人员和工人一起在一高炉建立一条龙试验田。经过反复研究与多次试验，迅速地解决了长期不敢提高风温的作法，把风温由七百五十度提高到九百度，并进行了原料过筛工作。不到二十天的时间，就取得了显著的效果。冶炼强度由1.029提高到1.092，焦比由七百二十三公斤下降到六百六十八公斤，利用系数由1.368提高到1.655。
    这一决定性的胜利，不仅以铁一般的事实粉碎了保守主义者，而且完全证明了提高冶炼强度和降低焦比不但可以兼得，而且大有可为。这一事实说明了老炉子的潜力还是很大的。厂的领导同志和职工群众也认识到，设备陈旧确实带来不少问题。但是面对着这一客观存在，是减少生产消极地迁就旧设备呢，还是积极维护，使它发挥更大的作用呢？他们坚决采取了后一种办法。检修工人为了维护高炉大钟，轮流到炉顶去检查，一发现毛病就立即抢修，直到换了新的大钟才离开。对其他设备也采取了同样办法，千方百计，力争增产。如五十二孔的炼焦炉，其中就有二十六孔有问题，由于群众维护得好，既增加了焦炭的产量，保证了高炉的供应，又延长了焦炉的寿命。一高炉本应今年进行大修，但为了生产更多的生铁，该厂对一高炉进行了严格的鉴定，并请苏联专家协助检查。检查后一致认为，加强对炉子的维护，可以把大修推到明年。因此，该厂计划落实后，生产任务反而由原订的四十五万吨增到五十二万吨。
    面对这个厂一年多以来生产一直是上升的事实，右倾保守主义者不得不认输，但是，这并不等于同右倾思想的斗争已经停息了，一有适当时机右倾保守思想便会抬头。今年计划落实和强调加强管理工作时，又出现了一股歪风，有人认为，似乎大企业大搞群众运动的办法不灵了，他们企图把问题都归罪于大搞群众运动。他们要简单地恢复被破除了的，束缚生产的规章制度，走回头路。在讨论计划时他们总想把计划订得越低越好，在他们的影响下，使一部分干部和职工产生了相当严重的松劲和盲目乐观的情绪。群众的干劲也受到一定挫折。但是，这些人毕竟是少数，由于广大职工经过整风和总路线学习，提高了觉悟，特别是由于整风后加强了党的领导，右倾保守主义者在厂内是没有什么市场的。在党委正确领导下，很快就粉碎了保守主义的种种论点。
    经验证明，党的领导必须经常注意同右倾保守主义者作斗争。这个厂所以能够取得如此辉煌的成绩，及时驳倒与粉碎右倾保守主义者的谬论，是一个决定性的因素。
        发动群众，大搞技术革命
    广大职工群众在党的总路线的鼓舞下，个个斗志昂扬，干劲冲天，纷纷献策，许多车间、工段出现了群众自动组成的技术革命委员会、技术研究小组，有些车间和工段联合组成技术革命合作社，并涌现出大批技术革命和技术革新的积极分子。为了保证高炉吃好，原料工人用人工过筛办法，把烧结矿大小块度分开。焦化车间炉前技师孟庆义，在很多设备上进行了技术改革，大家都称他为“万能手”。他创造了用水玻璃和耐火泥搅拌后喷到炼焦炉内，可以延长炉子寿命的办法，经试验获得成功。原料工人金彦春，为了研究原料自动过筛的设备问题，用各种办法来作试验。一高炉（青年炉）的小伙子们技术革新的劲头更足，他们在党委的支持下，于去年5月，破除不合理的陈旧规程，大干了一个星期，把料批突破到127批，冶炼强度大为提高，结果连续创造了新纪录二十五次，年度计划修改了九次，增产六万吨。正是由于全体职工干劲十足，技术革新获得成绩，才使高炉利用系数节节提高。
    旧的平衡突破了，又出现了不少新问题，诸如原料条件还不够好；卷扬机速度慢，影响及时供炉子吃饱；铁水出多了而铸铁机能力不足；提高冶炼强度后，炉内温度增高，等等。在新的困难面前如何办呢？唯一的途径就是把群众的冲天干劲进一步引导到大搞技术革命与技术革新运动上来，有领导有计划地解决生产关键和薄弱环节。党委确定以高炉为纲组织全厂各车间、工段进行共产主义的大协作，组织新的平衡。从去年以来，实现了重大的技术措施达十几项，如：原料过筛、焦炭分级、提高铁粉的含铁量、提高烧结碱度、扩大风口直径（由一百三十毫米到一百八十毫米）以及最近投入生产的团球矿机等。每实现一项重大措施，都带来了极大的经济效益，其中仅前三项，就使高炉提高产量30％左右。党委在领导技术革命与技术革新运动中贯彻了以下原则和作法：
    （1）领导出课题，发动群众献计献策。党委根据每个时期生产中的关键问题，及时向群众交代，要群众动脑筋想办法，而后根据群众意见加以研究，归纳成几种不同的方案，再交给群众比较和辩论。例如焦炭分级，过去曾到兄弟厂学过，因只是少数工程技术人员研究试验，一直没有实现。这次检修车间提出这个课题后，群众贴出了七十多张大字报，领导上归纳为三种方案：第一是大干，修矿槽，盖厂房；第二只修矿槽，把原有的两根运输皮带引长，不盖厂房；第三是只安装一个震动筛。经过反复辩论比较后，采纳了第三种方案。由于制造设备和施工中大量利用了旧废材料，这个工程只花了五百元，工期只用了九个小时，只这一项就使高炉产量提高8％。每项重大措施的实现，党委都是运用从群众中来到群众中去的领导方法，结合着生产技术上的试验研究进行。这样做对工程技术人员教育极为深刻，使他们在实际斗争中认识科学研究必须贯彻群众路线。这样做还能促进广大群众学习技术；也是实现领导干部、工程技术人员和工人三结合的一种最好形式。
      （2）贯彻两条腿走路的方针——洋土结合。很多重要措施在短期内能够实现，主要原因之一是坚决贯彻了洋土结合的方针。他们不是一味追求洋的，而是因陋就简，废物利用，力求自力更生。许多技术措施都是经过艰苦摸索，反复试验才搞成的。例如他们为了进一步改善原料条件，在今年建成的球形团矿设备（好处是颗粒均匀透气性好，还原性好，再生粉末少），全部是职工自己动手设计、绘图，大部是利用现有材料，自己制造和安装的。
    （3）既大胆革新创造，又一切经过试验。去年他们开始试行的提高冶炼强度和降低焦比双管齐下的操作方针，是一个大胆的尝试，它不仅是炼铁生产上长期争论的重大问题，而且在这个老炉子推行到底会发生什么情况，谁也没有把握。他们采取的办法是先集中主要力量在一高炉进行试验，获得成功后，才有准备地在二高炉相继推行。又如采用扩大风口直径和为了加强冷水压力，把风口水管改为上进下出，双进单出的措施，也是先在一个风口上试验成功而后普遍推广的。这样，既进行了技术上的革新，提高了生产，又保证了安全。
      大抓红旗竞赛，鼓舞群众前进
    在厂党委的经常教育下，党的社会主义建设总路线已被群众所掌握，变成为伟大的物质力量。职工群众以磅礴气势进行忘我的劳动。例如检修工人加固高炉炉顶保护板，过去一般是休风检修还需用三十二小时。大跃进以来，工人们为了不影响生产，在不休风的情况下抢修。在炉顶上操作的人被烟熏倒后，另一个人马上接上去。特别是去年9月，二高炉正要出铁，突然发生铁口漏水事故。如不按时出铁，就会影响产量，造成炉内结瘤；如按时出铁，就可能发生爆炸的危险，威胁了全厂的安全。情况是万分紧急的，炉前技师孙福财同志（老工人，共产党员，今年提为副厂长）挺身而出，冒着生命的危险，凭着三十年的经验终于安全的把铁水引了出来。许许多多英雄人物所创造的奇迹在群众中树立了良好的榜样。为了使他们更好地带动广大群众，发挥先进人物和先进集体的作用，他们大力组织了红旗竞赛运动。一年以来，这个运动开展得轰轰烈烈，生动有力。实践证明，红旗竞赛，是组织群众生产与群众进行自我教育的最好的形式，通过这个竞赛，充分调动起各种积极因素，并且通过竞赛评比来总结经验，改进工作，教育群众学先进，赶先进，达到互相取长补短，共同提高的目的。
    这个厂同本公司的二铁厂特别是和太钢的炼铁厂，从去年4月起，展开了兄弟般的友谊竞赛。他们的生产水平大体相当，经常处于你追我赶和高低不分的状态。谁稍一疏忽就有落在后面的危险。厂部每天在大门口把这三个厂子的战况公布出来，让大家了解形势。全厂职工群众无时不关心三个厂的战况，下班之后，总要到黑板前看看自己的劳动成果和兄弟厂的情况。不少职工家属也卷入了竞赛，帮助砸矿，并经常跑来看战况，给亲人送茶送饭。去年9月上、中旬，该厂在操作上忽略了“顺则攻，不顺则稳”的原则，生产一度不好。结果二铁厂跑到前边了，太钢也接近本厂的水平，情况十分紧急。厂党委动员群众展开保红旗战斗，工人自动提出“大干十天，赛二铁，超太钢，誓保红旗永领先”的口号。许多领导干部和工人一起参加战斗，科室工作人员也参加了突击运原料。终于在9月下旬创造了四次新纪录，保住了红旗。12月是厂际竞赛决定全年胜负的重要关头，竞赛达到了最紧张阶段。上旬太钢第一，但高炉利用系数每立方米容积只超过本厂七十公斤生铁。在形势非常紧张的情况下，全体职工精神焕发，斗志昂扬，紧密团结，互相支援，加以公司其他厂的支援和协作，他们创造出更高的成绩，高炉利用系数全月达到2.265的纪录，仍然是全国大中型高炉的冠军。
    厂内协作竞赛，是厂际竞赛的基础。现代化高炉生产技术十分复杂，它要求全体职工服从于统一指挥，协同动作，互相创造条件，否则组织生产大跃进是不可能的。厂党委在保卫红旗的战斗中，在“以高炉为纲，全面跃进”的口号下，大力组织全厂各车间、工段之间的协作竞赛。各车间纷纷向高炉递战表、保证书，并主动提出“为高炉服务”的口号。原料工段提出保证高炉“吃得好，吃得饱”，保证“不叫高炉等料”；烧结矿的粉末由20％下降到5％，再降到2％；铸铁机工人为了做好维护工作，不误生产，自己学会检修工作；检修车间提出绝不能因设备发生问题耽误生产，高炉工人则提出“决不辜负大家的支援”。高炉换风口过去要三十分钟，现在只要七、八分钟。厂内一、二高炉的友谊竞赛也是十分紧张的。今年1、2月份，二高炉领先，但3月则被一高炉夺了首位，4月互有胜负，月底仍是二高炉领先。5月下旬，一高炉条件还没有好转，为防止工人产生急躁情绪和泄气思想，一高炉提出“5月红旗暂丢掉，6月往回要”。二高炉为了鼓励工人继续努力，并避免骄傲情绪，则提出“6月困难多，红旗仍属我。”同时，两个炉子的职工又充分注意了互相支援，携手并进，以保全厂的红旗。例如6月一高炉原料供不上，二高炉运料组主动送去五车团矿。这种主动的支援别人，不分彼此，不计报酬的新风气，真正体现了“竞赛是对手，生产是战友”的口号和高尚的共产主义风格。
      加强党的领导，发挥各个组织作用
    这个厂能够获得这样大的成就，是加强党的领导，政治挂帅贯彻到一切活动中的结果。全厂干部，工程技术人员和职工群众，坚决服从党的领导，听党的话。党组织十分注意掌握党的技术人员政策，对技术人员既贯彻了积极改造又注意了团结和放手使用的方针。例如高炉值班室的工长，过去只管炉内记录，事事都得请示厂长。权力适当下放后，确定高炉临时发生的问题可以自行负责处理（如决定临时的休风等），这样就加重了工长的责任感，促使他们认真钻研技术，依靠工人掌握炉子生产情况。
    党委在领导方法上，经常采用突破重点推动全面，集中领导与发挥组织作用相结合的方法。党委在每个时期都能抓住生产中的关键问题与薄弱环节，组织全厂主要力量去解决。党委对每个时期的中心工作，都经过深入讨论，统一思想，统一认识，然后实行分工负责，发挥各个组织系统的作用。这个厂的行政管理和技术管理工作是比较健全的。为了配合大搞群众运动，他们把技术管理工作适当下放到车间或工段。这样不但能发挥群众的积极性，还能使领导有意识地摆脱一些事务工作，集中精力考虑重大问题。规章制度虽然也破了不少，但也注意及时立了一些。党的支部工作在运动中十分活跃，绝大部分党员是生产跃进中的先锋和骨干。为了加强党对重要部门的领导，党委统一调配了优秀党员。如高炉值班室是掌握高炉生产命脉的地方，当时十七名正副工长中只有一个党员。去年以来，先后调进六名有一定文化的青年工人党员，并在原有工长中发展了两名党员，政治情况就大大改观。工会工作在组织红旗竞赛和宣传推广先进经验方面，起了很好的作用。共青团主要抓青年炉（一高炉）和组织青年突击的工作，也起了党的助手的作用。
    如上所述，本溪第一钢铁厂坚持了十七个月的全国大中型高炉红旗厂，不是偶然的。这是在党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的产物。这个厂的经验证明，现代化大企业里是可以并且必须大搞群众运动。只有依靠广大群众，才能使生产跃进，才能顺利解决生产中的困难问题。经验还证明大搞群众运动，必须和生产上的集中统一领导相结合。这个厂的群众运动是突出的，但在生产上也是最有秩序，生产管理工作也是好的。全厂职工群众既有冲天干劲，又积极钻研技术，使苦干与巧干相结合，群众的热情巩固持久。厂党委的领导既有集中统一，又有分工负责，既有中心，又有一般，在政治与经济相结合的问题上提供了可贵的经验。
