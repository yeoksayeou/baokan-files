Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 9th. The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council announced here today that the people of Asian and African countries will hold "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day" on December 1st.

    In a statement read at a press conference held here, Secretary-General Youssef El-Sebai of the Secretariat called on the people of Asian and African countries to hold rallies and demonstrations on December 1st to show the imperialists their solidarity, to demand that the people of Africa gain independence, and to support the fighting brothers of the people of Congo, Cameroon, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Rhodesia and Nyasaland.
    The statement recalled the heroic struggles waged by the people of African countries against enslavement since the "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day" held on December 1st last year. The statement went on to say that the imperialists have adopted the most barbaric repression and violence in an attempt to drown the struggle for freedom in blood; they have used various means to sabotage and contain these struggles; they have also attempted to maintain their control over the colonies through certain superficial reforms, and to use Africa's wealth for their own purposes.
    The statement continued, but these hypocritical conspiracies cannot deceive anyone, and the heroic struggles of the people of African countries are moving forward and are achieving great victories. Independent African countries now possess more than one-third of the land in Africa and almost half of the population of the African continent.
    The statement said that the people of African countries know very well from their own experience that complete independence is the only way to eliminate the various ills that endanger their countries. They know that they cannot successfully transform their fragmented economies until they hold sovereignty over their homeland.
    The statement concluded by pointing out that immediate independence is Africa's demand today.

    亚非人民团结理事会号召举行非洲日
    帝国主义必须滚出非洲
    新华社开罗9日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处今天在这里宣布，亚非各国人民将在12月1日举行“帝国主义滚出非洲日”。
    书记处总书记优素福·西巴伊在这里举行的记者招待会上宣读的声明中，号召亚非各国人民在12月1日举行集会和游行，向帝国主义者显示他们的团结，要求使非洲人民获得独立，并且支持刚果、喀麦隆、怯尼亚、乌干达、南非、罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰正在进行斗争的兄弟人民。
    声明追叙了去年12月1日举行“帝国主义滚出非洲日”以来非洲各国人民为了反对奴役所进行的英勇斗争。声明接着说，帝国主义者采取了最野蛮的镇压和暴力行动，企图使争取自由的斗争为鲜血所淹没；他们采用各种手段来破坏和牵制这些斗争；他们还企图通过某些表面的改革来保持他们对殖民地的控制，并且利用非洲的财富为他们自己的目的服务。
    声明继续说，但是，这些虚伪的阴谋不能欺骗任何人，非洲各国人民的英勇斗争向前迈进着，并且正在取得巨大的胜利。非洲的独立国家现在拥有非洲三分之一以上的土地，并且拥有非洲大陆几乎一半的人口。
    声明说，非洲各国人民从他们亲身的体验中知道得很清楚，完全的独立是消除危害他们国家的各种弊端的唯一办法。他们知道，在他们握有他们祖国的主权以前，他们不能成功地改造他们支离破碎的经济。
    声明最后指出，立即获得独立是非洲今天的要求。
