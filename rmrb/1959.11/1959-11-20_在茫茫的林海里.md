    In the Vast Forest Sea
    Lu Fuwei
    I came to the Xing'an Mountains and was immediately captivated by the beautiful forests. As far as the eye could see, the pine waves rose and fell, the peaks were continuous, and the forest sea was boundless. Red pines over ten zhang tall, Amur cork trees and Manchurian ash trees several embraces thick, as well as oak trees, elm trees, birch trees… layer upon layer, without end. The Xing'an Mountains are the home of red pines. The red pines soar into the clouds, standing tall and majestic! They symbolize the strong and unyielding character of revolutionaries. In the years of storms, the Anti-Japanese United Army heroes fought bloody battles here; in peaceful days, the People's Liberation Army and forest police patrol day and night, guarding the country's green treasure trove. Among them, many had never seen a forest before; however, the numerous difficulties could not intimidate the fearless soldiers. At first, they found hunters to lead the way; later, they went in groups of three or teams of five, holding maps and compasses, drilling into the sun-遮蔽ing primeval forests.
    In Yichun Wuying, there was a company commander named Yin Xifang, whose hometown was on the coast of Shandong. He had crossed the sea to liberate Hainan Island, and later the Party asked him to climb the mountains to protect the Xing'an Mountains. The dark primeval forest is terrifying to those unfamiliar with it: the sun is not seen during the day, and at night only decaying dead trees and poisonous fungi emit a blue phosphorescence. He carried his gun and food, squatted under the roots of many large trees for shelter, tasted all kinds of wild plants, and finally became a genuine forest expert. I once looked through his diary, what a diary it was! It recorded in detail the terrain and forest conditions seen on each patrol, and also contained many specimens of leaves, flowers, and insects. He pointed to the specimens one by one and told me: "This yellow flower is called 'Ice Wave Flower,' and when it blooms, the fire prevention period begins. This dark green leaf is the precious Amur cork tree, its wood is the best." Then, he picked up a louse-like small insect and said: "This is a 'Grass-bug,' it both drinks blood and releases poison, and also transmits forest encephalitis. If you get bitten and pull it out with your hand, its head will stay in your flesh, causing it to rot and swell..." Yin Xifang lifted his trouser leg to show me the scars on his leg, humorously saying: "This is good, it hurts when it rains, like carrying a weather station with me. Now we know how to treat it: just burn it with a cigarette butt and it will loosen, then squeeze out the poisonous blood and it's guaranteed to be fine." He closed his diary and said in summary: "To protect the forest, you must first be familiar with the forest. Whenever a new comrade comes, I use this diary to tell him some basic knowledge about the forest." I trustingly gazed at his bright eyes, thinking with excitement: What a person who loves the forest, the people entrust them with the responsibility of protecting the country's forests, what else is there to worry about?
    In the Xing'an Mountains, some places never see the sun all year round, and some places are covered with white snow in all seasons. To fight cunning enemies here, you must have a strong will and unparalleled perseverance. In the early years of liberation, one winter, Pei Diande of the Dahailin team led seven comrades to intercept a group of Kuomintang remnants. Pei Diande and his comrades stepped through knee-deep snow, climbed over steep cliffs, their clothes soaked with sweat, which the cold wind then froze into ice. Hardtack as hard as stones was warmed in their arms, eating one layer at a time. After a long journey, a blizzard arose. They pulled on vines, climbed small trees, fell and got up again, never stopping their progress. At this time, Zhao Guangyou, who was weaker, fainted from the cold. In order to hide themselves, they could not light a fire. Pei Diande unhesitatingly took off his clothes and hugged Zhao Guangyou. Everyone gathered around, using their numb bodies to block the raging wind and snow. They were tightly united like a piece of red-hot steel, and the warmth of their comrades slowly awakened Zhao Guangyou. In this way, they overcame numerous difficulties and successfully completed the interception mission.
    The vast forest sea is a place where tigers and bears roam and wolves and foxes run rampant. They often come out to threaten production and harm people. The soldiers bear the responsibility of eliminating harm for the people. One day, Wang Zhifeng saw a large, clumsy black bear in a mountain depression, walking slowly and heavily, grunting as it passed. Although he was alone, a strong sense of responsibility prevented him from quietly hiding. He shot the black bear in the leg, and the black bear bared its teeth and claws and pounced on him. He hurriedly pulled the bolt, but alas, the shell was stuck! He hurriedly put down his gun, turned and climbed a large tree, but the black bear had already grabbed his leg. He kicked upwards with all his might, and the black bear pulled downwards, tearing a leather boot. The black bear, wounded in the leg, could not climb the tree, and roared and raged under the tree, guarding it and refusing to leave. Wang Zhifeng, sitting in the tree, suddenly had an idea. He broke off many branches and tied them into a large round bundle with his leggings. With a flick of his hand, the slippery bundle rolled down the slope. The black bear thought he had come down and chased after it angrily. Wang Zhifeng quietly climbed down the tree, picked up his gun, ran uphill, lit a fire, took out the shell, loaded a bullet, and rushed down the slope. He saw that the black bear had already torn the bundle to shreds. He aimed and fired another shot, killing the black bear that had been doing evil.
    In the vast, ocean-like forest, just throwing a spark can cause a huge disaster. In the past, there was smoke and fire everywhere in spring and autumn. During the day, sometimes the thick smoke obscured the sun, and at night you could see the sky burning red from a hundred miles away. Since the People's Liberation Army and the forest police moved into the forest, they have vigorously promoted fire prevention and organized the strength of the masses. Day and night, they look into the distance from high mountains and lookout towers to see if there are any fires. Women and children, holding red-tasseled spears, stood heroically at the main roads and entrances, checking pedestrians for fire hazards. This spring, Xiang Jide and Li Shouxian were helping Song Guizhi, a worker's family member, in Meicun village when they saw that the chimney went through a hole in the wooden house, which was very dangerous. They found bricks and mud to build a sleeve around it. An old man was deeply moved when he saw it and called on everyone to dismantle the old chimneys, finding that the wood around the chimneys was charred. After the "insurance chimney" was repaired, they saw that the surroundings of the house were full of weeds, and if a spark fell, the flames would quickly burn towards the forest, so they were even more worried. They suggested that the masses dig the ground around and plant vegetables. The masses smiled and said: "You really think carefully!" Everyone quickly began digging a thirty-meter-wide firebreak. This experience has been widely promoted in other places. Last summer, lightning struck a pine tree, and a raging fire burned more than ten meters above the ground. A hunter who was hunting in the deep mountains immediately reported it to the forest police. Everyone rushed to open a firebreak, cut down the big tree, and extinguished the dangerous fire. In this way, the huge strength of millions of people built a copper wall and iron wall to protect the forest and prevent fire, making many forest areas free from forest fires for five or six consecutive years.
    When the Ice Wave Flowers bloom proudly on the snow-capped slopes, announcing that spring has arrived in the Xing'an Mountains, the tense fire prevention period begins. Forest protectors carry their guns, tents, rice pots, and saws, climb over cliffs, cross over fallen trees, and go into the deep mountains to find and extinguish any possible source of fire. When they encounter wet mossy ground, they step on the trembling connected roots of grass, calling it the "sponge road"; when they encounter broken cliffs and steep walls, they climb up one person after another, foot on shoulder, calling it "Wisely Seizing Mount Hua"; if there is a deep water obstructing the way, they saw down a large tree to build a single-log bridge. When they arrive at the campsite, they light a blazing bonfire and cook mountain chicken, wild boar, wild vegetables and various dishes. At night, after the daily political study, the Anti-Japanese United Army's battle song "Fire warms the front of the chest, wind chills the back" resounds in the silent forest... When I visit them in the depths of the forest, I can hardly suppress my feelings of gratitude and admiration. What force enables them to maintain a revolutionary optimistic attitude in their arduous lives? What force enables them to develop the spirit of revolutionary heroism in difficult environments? I seek an answer. The following story took place in June this year:
    Jiao Fahe led five forest policemen to patrol in the deep mountains. They followed the small path trod out by hunters, and had been walking for five days without seeing a trace of anyone: looking up were towering ancient trees, and looking down were craggy mountain peaks, only to see many strange wild animal footprints printed on the ground. Dense thorn trees cut their hands and faces and clothes, and rotten fallen leaves were like a pool of silt, sinking straight down when stepped on. Swarms of mosquitoes and horseflies flew around them, and all kinds of beetles fell on their hats and shoulders. They were tired and exhausted. Suddenly, turning through a red pine forest, a barren cultivated land appeared in front of them, blooming with roses, irises, daylilies, peonies and other colorful flowers. Everyone suddenly felt a surge of spirit, but also felt strange: in this deep mountain and old forest, who else has ever cultivated land here? They vigilantly patrolled forward. Not far away, they saw three small wooden houses, which were already old, and the roofs had completely collapsed. In the collapsed wood, they excavated two pots and a few agricultural tools, and also saw two wooden planks: one engraved with crossed sickles and axes, and one engraved with a five-pointed star—after enduring wind and rain, it still shone with unquenchable light! Ah, this was originally the site of the Anti-Japanese United Army in those years! Everyone silently paid high tribute to the revolutionary pioneers. At night, around the blazing bonfire, Jiao Fahe told the stories of the struggles of revolutionary martyrs such as Yang Jingyu and Zhao Shangzhi. Zhang Xiantang, this stubborn young man, his face was cut by thorn trees, and mosquitoes and horseflies surrounded him to suck his blood, but he did not cry. His feet were cut by sharp stones, and his shoes were filled with blood, but he did not cry, but now, a surge of hot tears welled up in his eyes. He said excitedly: "The Anti-Japanese United Army heroes shed blood and sacrificed their lives, handing such a large forest treasure to us, saying: 'Protect it well'! The people of the whole country are trustingly watching us: 'Now it's up to you'! What else can we be afraid of, hardship and difficulty?" He pulled out his knife and carved a solemn oath on a tall red pine. At dawn, the team stepped on the footprints of the Anti-Japanese United Army heroes and continued to move forward! They continued to move forward along the path opened up by the revolutionary martyrs! They raised their heads, straightened their chests, and strode forward, marching in the vast and deep forest sea, marching in the socialist motherland...

    在茫茫的林海里
    陆拂为
    我来到兴安岭，就被美丽的森林迷住了。极目四望，松涛起伏，峰峦连绵，林海茫茫。十多丈高的红松，几抱粗的黄菠萝和水曲柳，还有柞树、榆树、桦树……重重叠叠，无边无际。兴安岭是红松的故乡。红松高耸入云，巍然屹立！它象征着革命者坚强刚毅的品格。在风暴的年月里，抗联英雄在这里浴血战斗；在和平的日子里，解放军和森林警察日日夜夜巡逻守卫着祖国的绿色大宝库。他们中间，有许多人从来没有见过森林；但是，重重困难吓不倒无畏的战士。起初，他们找猎人带路；后来，就三个一组，五个一队，拿着地图和指北针，钻进遮天蔽日的原始森林。
    伊春五营有位中队长叫殷锡芳，老家在山东大海边。他曾经跨海解放海南岛，后来党又要他来登山保卫兴安岭。黑沉沉的原始森林对不熟悉它的人是可怕的：白天不见太阳，夜晚只有腐朽的枯木和毒菌发着蓝荧荧的磷光。他背起枪枝粮食，在许多棵大树根下蹲着露宿过，尝遍了各种野生植物，终于成为一个地地道道的森林通。我曾翻看了他的日记，这是一本怎样的日记呵！它详细记载着每次巡逻看到的地形和林相，还夹有许多树叶、花草、昆虫的标本。他指着一样样的标本告诉我：“这种黄花叫冰浪花，它一开，防火期就开始了。这种墨绿的树叶就是珍贵的黄菠萝，它的木质最好。”接着，他拿起一个虱子似的小虫说：这是“草?子”，又喝血又放毒，还传染森林脑炎，如果给咬住了用手一拔，它的头就留在肉里，会腐烂和发肿……殷锡芳撩起裤管，给我看他腿上的伤痕，幽默地说：“这可好哩，阴天下雨就发痛，像随身带了个气象台。现在我们会治它了：只要用香烟头一烧它就松，再把毒血挤掉保险没事”。他合上日记本，总结似地对我说：“保卫森林首先要熟悉森林，每当来了个新同志，我就拿这日记告诉他一些关于森林的常识。”我信赖地注视着他那明亮的眼睛，激动地想：这是一个多么热爱森林的人呵，人民把保卫祖国森林的责任交托给他们，还有什么要担心的呢？
    在兴安岭，有的地方终年不见太阳，有的地方四季铺着白雪。在这里和狡猾的敌人斗争，必须有坚强的意志和无比的毅力。解放初年的一个冬天，大海林队裴殿德率领七位同志堵截一股国民党残匪。裴殿德他们踩着没膝的深雪，翻过峻峭的悬崖，汗水浸透了衣服，冷风又把它冻成冰凌。干粮硬得像石块就揣在怀里暖一暖，化一层吃一层。经过长途跋涉，刮起狂风暴雪，他们拉着藤条，攀着小树，跌倒了又爬起，始终没有停止前进的脚步。这时，身体较弱的赵光友冻得昏倒了，为了隐蔽自己，他们不能生火。裴殿德毫不犹豫的解开自己的衣裳，把赵光友搂在怀里。大家都围上来，用自己麻木了的身子挡住狂暴的风雪。他们紧紧地团结得像一块炽热的钢铁，战友的暖流使赵光友慢慢苏醒过来。就这样，他们突破了重重困难，胜利地完成了堵截任务。
    茫茫林海，是虎熊盘踞、狼狐纵横的地方。它们常常出来威胁生产，伤害人们。战士们担负着为民除害的责任。有一天，汪之凤在山坳里看到一头笨大的黑熊，迈着缓慢而沉重的步伐，哼哼地走过。他虽然独自一人，但高度的责任感使他不能悄悄躲开。他一枪射中了黑熊的腿，黑熊张牙舞爪向他扑来。他连忙扳开枪栓，坏了，弹壳卡住了！他慌忙放下枪，转身爬上一棵大树，黑熊已经抱住了他的腿。他用力往上蹬，黑熊使劲往下拖，把一只牛皮靰鞡撕裂了。黑熊伤了腿上不了树，在树下咆哮怒吼，暴跳如雷，守着不走。汪之凤坐在树上突然心生一计，他折了许多枝桠用绑腿布捆成圆圆的一个大树团。手一松，滑溜溜的树团沿坡滚到山下。黑熊以为他下来了，气呼呼的去追赶。汪之凤悄悄爬下树，捡起枪奔到上坡生起一堆火，把弹壳取出来，填上子弹赶到坡下，只见黑熊已经把树团撕得粉碎。他瞄准补了一枪，击毙了这头为非作歹的大黑熊。
    在辽阔像海洋的森林，只要扔个火头就能造成巨大的灾难。过去春秋间到处是烟火，白天有时浓烟遮蔽了太阳，夜里能看见百里远烧红的天空。自从解放军和森林警察进驻森林，就大力宣传防火，并把群众的力量组织起来。他们日日夜夜在高山和了望台上眺望远处有无火情。妇女和儿童拿着红缨枪，雄赳赳的站在要道和入山口，检查行人有无引火物。今年春天，项纪德和李寿先在美村屯帮助工人家属宋桂芝劳动，看到烟囱在木屋的窟窿里穿出去，非常危险。就找砖和泥砌个套子套在外面，一位老大爷看了深为感动，招呼大家都来拆卸旧烟囱，发现烟囱周围的木头都烧焦了。“保险烟囱”修好后，他们看见房屋四周都是荒草，万一掉下个火星，火焰会迅速烧向森林，就更放心不下。他们建议群众在四周刨地种菜，群众笑着说：“你们可真想得周到呵！”大家很快地动手刨出一道三十米宽的防火道。这个经验在其他地方得到普遍的推广。去年夏天，雷电击中一棵松树，熊熊大火在离地十多米的高处燃烧起来，一个在深山打猎的猎人马上报告森林警察，大家赶去开出一条防火道，把大树放倒，扑灭了这危险的火。就这样，千百万群众的巨大力量，筑成护林防火的铜墙铁壁，使许多林区连续五、六年无森林火灾。
    当冰浪花冲着白雪皑皑的山坡凛然开放，宣告春天到了兴安岭，紧张的防火期就开始了。森林保卫者们背起枪枝、帐篷、饭锅、锯子，翻过一座座悬崖，越过一根根倒木，到深山去寻找和扑灭可能发生的任何火源。遇见潮湿的青苔地，就踩着颤悠悠连结的草根前进，说是“海绵马路”；碰到断崖峭壁，就人接人、脚踩肩的向上爬，说是“智取华山”；前面有淌不过的深水拦路，就锯倒一棵大树架成独木桥，到了宿营地，燃起熊熊的篝火，烧煮山鸡、野猪、野菜各种菜肴。夜晚，每天坚持的政治学习结束后，寂静的森林里响起抗联的“火烤胸前暖，风吹背后寒”的战歌……当我在林海深处访问他们的时候，总难以抑止自己的感激、钦佩的心情。什么力量使他们在艰苦的生活中保持了革命乐观主义的情绪？什么力量使他们在困难的环境中发扬了革命英雄主义的精神？我寻求着解答。下面这个故事发生在今年6月间：
    焦发和率领五个森林警察到深山巡逻，他们沿着猎人踩出来的小径，走了五天就没有人踪了：抬头是参天的古树，低头是嶙峋的山峰，只见许多奇奇怪怪的野兽足迹印在地上。丛生的刺树割破了他们的手脸和衣服，腐烂的落叶像一滩淤泥，人一踩就直往下沉。成群的蚊虻围着他们飞舞，帽上和双肩落满了各种甲虫。他们是又困又乏，疲劳不堪。突然，转过一个红松树林，前面出现一片荒芜了的耕地，盛开着玫瑰、马兰、金针、芍药等各种五色缤纷的鲜花。大家猛觉精神一振，但又觉得奇怪：在这高山老林深处，还有谁来种过地呢？他们警惕的向前巡逻，走不多远，果然看见三间小木房，年代已经久远，房顶完全塌陷。在塌陷下来的木头中，他们发掘到两口锅和几把农具，又看见两块木板：一块上刻着交叉的镰刀和斧头，一块上刻着五角星——历经风吹雨打，依旧闪耀着不灭的光辉！呵，这原来是当年抗日联军的地方！大家默默地对革命先驱者致以崇高的敬意。夜晚，围着熊熊的篝火，焦发和就讲杨靖宇、赵尚志等革命先烈的斗争故事。张显堂，这个倔强的小伙子，刺树割破了脸，蚊虻围着吮吸，他没有哭，尖石割破了脚，鲜血灌满了鞋子，他没有哭，可是现在，汹涌的热泪夺眶而出。他激动地说：“抗联英雄流血牺牲，把这么大的森林宝库递到我们手里说：‘好好保卫它吧’！全国人民信任地注视着我们：‘现在要靠你们啦’！咱们还能怕什么艰苦和困难？”他拔出刀，就在一棵高大的红松上刻下了庄严的誓言。天一亮，队伍踏着抗联英雄的足迹继续前进！沿着革命先烈开辟的道路继续前进！他们昂着头，挺起胸，迈开步伐，行进在辽阔深远的林海、行进在社会主义的祖国……。
