We are now planting wheat.

One process in planting wheat is breaking up the soil clumps. This process seems simple, but it is very important. The purpose is to make the soil loose and the ground level so that the wheat seeds will not be too suppressed or hindered, and can grow smoothly. Old farmers say that smaller soil clumps are not only harmless to the germination of wheat, but are actually beneficial. When breaking up the soil clumps, people are also told not to break them up too finely or too small, just make sure there are no large soil clumps. Although a wheat seed is small, it contains tremendous vitality. When it encounters the appropriate temperature and humidity, it always tries its best to sprout and grow. When the season for germination arrives, the wheat seed, regardless of whether it is covered by hard soil or heavy rubble, always strives to grow. To the left, to the right, forward, backward, twisting and turning, it works hard upwards, always trying to find any gaps or cracks. When it encounters a relatively hard soil clump, the seedling pushes hard against it, insisting that these things give way. Finally, after arduous struggle, the wheat seedling emerges from the soil. Although its tender shoots are bent, and even have some scars, it grows particularly strong after this struggle and can withstand the test of the severe winter winds, frost, and snow.

This makes me think of our people's communes. As soon as the people's communes in our country appeared, they immediately aroused extreme hatred and vicious attacks from all hostile forces opposed to socialism. From the very beginning, imperialist elements hurled the most savage curses and the most despicable slanders at the people's communes. Among the most malicious attacks, one argument was that the people's communes were "premature babies." However, the facts of the past year have fully demonstrated that the people's communes are not premature babies in oxygen tents, nor are they flowers in greenhouses. Is it possible that a seedling grows into a big tree as soon as it sprouts, or that a person is born as a strong young man in his twenties? If one grows into a big tree or a young man in his twenties as soon as he is born, that would be good, but is it possible? If the people's communes were "premature babies," why can't typhoons blow them down, droughts dry them out, or floods wash them away? People describe their own people's communes as "unbreakable by thunder" and "indestructible by atomic bombs." Who has ever seen such a strong "premature baby"!

Our people's commune movement is a great mass movement actively demanded, supported, and participated in by hundreds of millions of peasants. It is the product of the great development of agricultural production, the great development of farmland water conservancy, the enthusiasm of peasants in running industries, and the great increase in the socialist consciousness of peasants during the Great Leap Forward last year. When the water flows, a channel is formed; when the melon is ripe, it falls off its stem – it is a natural and inevitable outcome that is in accordance with reason and human feelings. People are eager to use the people's communes to change the poor and blank state of their country, so they are created. Otherwise, even if one shouts until one is hoarse, one cannot create them.

Wheat seeds do not stop germinating because of the suppression of soil clumps, and our people's communes are also born, grow, and become stronger amidst the extreme hatred and vicious attacks of all hostile forces opposed to socialism, and amidst the most savage curses and despicable slanders of imperialist elements.

    种麦有感
    刘丰
    现在我们正在种麦子。
    种麦有一道工序，是打碎土块。这道工序，看来简单，却很重要。目的是叫土碎地平，麦种就能不受太多的压抑、阻挠，长得顺当。老农民说：小一点的土块，对麦子的出生，不仅无害，反而有好处。打土块的时候，又关照人们不要打得太细、太碎，只要没有太大的土块就行了。一粒麦种虽小，可是它蕴育着巨大的生命力，遇到适当的温度、湿度，它总是千方百计要发芽生长。出生的季节到了，麦种就不管盖在它上面的是坚硬的泥土，还是沉重瓦砾，幼芽总是千方百计地生长。向左向右向前向后，拐着弯抹着角，努力向上努力向上，有一点空隙、缝子它总不放过去，遇到比较坚硬的土块，幼芽就使劲地它顶，非叫这些东西让路不可。最后麦子的幼芽经过艰苦奋斗，终于从土里脱颖而出。虽然它的嫩芽弯曲了，甚至有些伤痕，可是它经过这一场斗争，生长得特别茁壮，经得起严冬的风霜雪冻的考验。
    由此，使我想到我们的人民公社。我国人民公社一出现，就立即引起了所有反对社会主义的敌对势力的极端的仇视和恶毒的攻击。帝国主义分子从一开始就把一切最野蛮的咒骂和最卑鄙的诽谤投向人民公社。在最恶毒的攻击中，有一种论调就是人民公社是“早生儿”。可是一年来的事实已充分说明，人民公社并不是氧箱中的早生儿，也不是暖室里的花朵。幼芽一长出来就是大树，或者人一生出来就是一个二十来岁精强力壮的小伙子，好则好矣，然而这是可能的事吗？一生长出来就是大树，就是二十来岁的小伙子，是否能马上适应得了世界上环境和冷暖？人民公社如果是“早生儿”，为什么台风吹不垮，干旱旱不垮，大水冲不垮？人民描写自己的人民公社是“雷打不散”，“原子弹也炸不垮”的。谁见过这样健壮的“早生儿”！
    我们的人民公社运动是一个有几亿农民积极要求、拥护和参加的伟大的群众运动。它是去年大跃进中农业生产大发展、农田水利大发展、农民办工业的积极性和农民社会主义觉悟大高涨的产物。水到渠成，瓜熟蒂落，完全是顺乎天理，合乎人情的必然产物。人们迫切地要用人民公社来改变自己国家一穷二白的面貌，所以它才产生。否则即使是喊哑了嗓子也是喊不出来的。
    麦种不因土块的压抑而停止出生，我们的人民公社也在所有反对社会主义的敌对势力的极端的仇视和恶毒的攻击下，在帝国主义分子最野蛮的咒骂和最卑鄙的诽谤中出生、成长和壮大。
