    The Zhongshan Sugar Factory in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, established in October 1957, is a large-scale sugar factory with a daily processing capacity of 2,000 tons of sugarcane, designed, manufactured, and built in China.

    In the two years since the Zhongshan Sugar Factory went into production, it has overfulfilled its production tasks every month, and both crushing seasons have comprehensively overfulfilled the production plan. The funds accumulated for the state are already equal to twice the factory's investment. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Zhongshan Sugar Factory developed diversified operations and comprehensive utilization, successively producing more than 40 kinds of products, including bagasse-made activated carbon, metal cutting machine tools and electrical equipment, as well as pig iron, cement, and indigenous fertilizer, supplying the needs of industrial and agricultural production and construction. Since then, the Zhongshan Sugar Factory has become a factory with sugar production as its center, while also producing a variety of products. After the cessation of crushing in mid-May this year, the factory's machine repair work has taken another leap forward compared to last year. By adopting methods such as reviving waste materials, replacing old with new, making the most of materials, and improving operations, they saved 14,000 yuan in materials and more than 11,000 man-hours, increasing work efficiency by 19.54%. At the same time, they independently manufactured a complete set of equipment for a bagasse paper mill with a daily output of two tons, and have already installed it and put it into production; they have also produced relatively precise planers and various tools.

    In the initial period of production at the Zhongshan Sugar Factory, the average technical level of the factory's workers was only level three, and there were also a large number of apprentices. Due to the workers' unfamiliarity with the equipment's performance, the boiler combustion efficiency was low, and bagasse was not enough for burning, so a large amount of firewood and coal had to be supplemented. At the same time, the clarification and evaporation tanks had severe scaling, and material handling was unbalanced. Through the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, the staff and workers spoke out freely, posting nearly 20,000 big-character posters in a short period of time, of which 1,462 were related to improving equipment and production, thereby breaking through the key to production, and both the daily cane crushing volume and the pressing extraction rate exceeded the design capacity.

    In the fourth quarter of last year, they again focused on technological innovation and breaking through raw material barriers, launching a debate among employees on whether it was possible to break the conventional rules of sugar factories and start production without comprehensive trial operation? Can white sugar be produced without sulfur? After voicing opinions and debating, the masses put forward many rationalization proposals. As a result, a large amount of fuel and materials for the overall trial operation were saved, and a low-sulfur clarification method was created, completing the annual plan seventeen days ahead of schedule.

    This spring, when continuous overcast and rainy weather affected the supply of sugarcane, threatening the completion of the February plan, the factory's Party and government leaders immediately led more than 300 staff and workers to the countryside to rush-transport sugarcane. The soaring enthusiasm of the staff and workers caused production results to rise sharply, and new records appeared one after another.

    During the 1958 to 1959 crushing season, the supply of materials fell short of demand. The leadership promptly made the situation clear to the masses, inspiring employees to break superstitions, emancipate their minds, and overcome the material barriers. As a result, technical personnel and workers worked closely together, and after many experiments, summarized a set of advanced methods, so that the sulfur consumption quota per ton of sugar was reduced from 5.91 kilograms to 1.71 kilograms, saving the country more than 100,000 yuan in wealth throughout the crushing season.

    A sugar factory is an agricultural product processing factory. The raw material sugarcane used every day cannot be stored and needs to be continuously supplied by the communes every day; at the same time, the variety, quality, and quantity of sugarcane have a great impact on production. Therefore, close ties between workers and peasants, and reliance on the strong support of local Party and government, are of particular significance to sugar factories.

    Since the establishment of the Zhongshan Sugar Factory, with the strong support of the county and communes, the sugarcane planting area in the county has been expanded, and the labor force for cutting sugarcane has been arranged in a timely manner. The sugar factory also actively supports agriculture and local industry. For example, to cooperate with agriculture to improve the yield per unit area, the sugar factory often sends technical personnel to the sugarcane-producing areas to guide production, and runs sugarcane technical reform training classes in areas where more sugarcane is planted. When local industry and commune industry need the sugar factory to help solve problems, the sugar factory also does its best to help solve them.

    不断前进的中山糖厂
    1957年10月建立的广东省中山县中山糖厂，是我国自行设计、制造和建筑安装的、每昼夜处理甘蔗二千吨的大型糖厂。
    中山糖厂投入生产两年来，月月超额完成生产任务，两个榨季都全面超额完成了生产计划，为国家积累的资金已经等于建厂投资的两倍。在大跃进的1958年，中山糖厂开展多种经营和大搞综合利用，先后生产了四十多种产品，其中有蔗渣制活性炭、金属切削机床和电气设备，以及生铁、水泥、土化肥等，供应了工农业生产建设的需要。从此，中山糖厂变成了一个以制糖为中心，同时生产多种产品的工厂。今年5月中停榨以后，这个厂的修机工作比去年又跃进了一步，采取废料复活、以旧代新、物尽其用、改善操作等办法，节约材料一万四千元，节约工时一万一千多，提高工效19.54％。同时，他们自行制造了全套日产二吨的蔗渣造纸厂设备，并且已经安装起来投入生产；还制出比较精密的刨床和多种工具。
    中山糖厂投入生产初期，全厂工人平均技术等级只有三级，还有大批学徒。由于工人对设备性能生疏，以致锅炉燃烧效率低，蔗渣不够烧，还要补充大量柴、煤；同时，澄清蒸发罐积垢严重，物料处理不平衡。通过反浪费、反保守运动，职工大鸣大放，短期内就贴出大字报近二万张，其中有关改善设备、改进生产的有一千四百六十二条，从而突破了生产关键，日榨蔗量、压榨抽出率都超过设计能力。
    去年第四季度，他们又以技术革新和冲破原材料关为中心，发动职工辩论是否可以打破糖厂常规，不经过综合试机就开榨生产？不用硫磺能否生产白糖？经过鸣放、辩论，群众提出了许多合理化建议，结果节省了总体试机的大量燃料和材料，并创造了低硫澄清法，提前十七天完成了年度计划。
    今年春天，当连绵阴雨影响甘蔗供应，威胁着完成2月份计划的时候，厂的党政领导立即亲自率领职工三百多人，下乡抢运甘蔗。职工们的冲天干劲，使生产成绩直线上升，新纪录接连出现。
    1958年到1959年榨季，材料供不应求。领导上及时把情况向群众交代清楚，启发职工破除迷信，解放思想，攻克材料关。结果，技术人员和工人密切结合，经过多次的试验，总结出一套先进方法，使每吨糖消耗硫磺定额从五点九一公斤下降到一点七一公斤，全榨季为国家节约财富十多万元。
    糖厂是农产品加工厂，每日所用的原料甘蔗不能储存，需要公社逐日不断地供应；同时甘蔗的品种、质量、数量对生产有很大的影响。因此，密切工农联系，依靠当地党政的大力支持，在糖厂有特别重大的意义。
    中山糖厂建厂以来，在县和公社的大力支持下，县内扩大了甘蔗种植面积，并且及时地安排了砍甘蔗的劳动力。糖厂也主动地支援农业和地方工业。如配合农业提高单位面积产量，糖厂经常派出技术人员到蔗区指导生产，并在植蔗比较多的地区开办甘蔗技术改革训练班。地方工业和公社工业需要糖厂协助解决问题的时候，糖厂也都尽力帮助解决。
