Emerging Towns

    If you opened a map published before liberation, you wouldn't find a single town marked in the vast Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture. If you traveled throughout the region, you would only see desolate villages. Now, those days are history. A large number of emerging towns are appearing one after another.

    Zhaojue, the capital of the autonomous prefecture, was built on the ruins of a place inhabited by only three families. Now, it has a population of nearly ten thousand. Six or seven intersecting streets outline the city area. Tall buildings stand on both sides of the streets, with new construction covering more than 100,000 square meters. On the streets, Yi farmers leading ponies to buy goods are bustling around, and trucks carrying goods are constantly coming and going, making it very lively. In the afternoon, the city broadcasting station broadcasts pleasant songs to the residents. Yi children wearing red scarves and groups of Yi workers happily walk through the streets. Counties such as Meigu, Butuo, Ganluo, Wagang, and Puxiong were originally villages with only a dozen or even a few households. Now, they all have two or three beautiful streets and populations of over a thousand. Some districts and townships have also built new towns. Bapu in Meigu County had only two households before liberation. Constant feuds and械斗 meant it was almost cut off from the outside world. After the democratic reforms, two highways were opened to here, and factories, shops, schools, and hospitals were established one after another. The remote mountain ravine immediately turned into a bustling market town. There are now more than 100 newly built houses, more than 1,100 residents, frequent vehicles, and a mixed crowd of people and horses, creating a scene of prosperity.

    These emerging towns are the result of the rapid development of various constructions in the Liangshan area, bringing happiness and prosperity to the Yi people. The trading companies in each new town sell more than a thousand kinds of goods, and people can buy whatever they need. Through these towns, an average of more than one million yuan worth of goods is supplied to the Yi people every month. Fashionable printed cloth, woolen sweaters, enamelware, towels, and soap are already common daily necessities. With the development of production and the continuous improvement of the people's lives, the sales volume of goods continues to rise, and the market is becoming increasingly prosperous. The total sales of various new towns in the first half of this year reached more than 11 million yuan, exceeding the same period before the democratic reforms by more than 50%. In the past, buying goods required traveling over mountains and rivers to Han Chinese market towns or enduring the heavy exploitation of traveling merchants, and a large number of local specialties had no sales channels. Now, with the emerging towns as the center, more than 400 supply and marketing points spread throughout the countryside, forming a trade and marketing network. The total value of goods entering and leaving the emerging town of Bapu reaches tens of thousands of yuan per month, making it a distribution center for materials in the mountainous area.

    The newly built highways and many post roads connect the new towns from all directions, closely linking the urban and rural areas and the Greater and Lesser Liangshan with the Han Chinese areas. A large number of machines, building materials, and daily necessities are continuously transported along the highways. Liangshan's local specialties are also sold to other regions. Various new towns are being built into local industrial bases. The whole prefecture has more than 50 state-owned factories distributed in the emerging towns. Each new town has built two or three or more factories last year to directly serve local agricultural production. Zhaojue City already has several factories such as iron factories, machinery factories, automobile repair factories, and cement factories that have been built and put into production. These emerging towns all have film projection teams, cultural centers, hospitals, and schools. A large number of Yi children are studying here, and the new towns are cultivating the first generation of educated Yi people.

    新兴的城镇
    翻开解放前出版的地图，在辽阔的大小凉山彝族聚居区找不到一个城镇的标志，走遍全区，只能看到一些荒凉的小村。现在，这些已成历史，大批新兴城镇一个接一个地出现了。
    自治州首府昭觉，是在只有三户人家居住的废墟上建设起来的。现在已经有近万人口，六、七条交叉街道，勾画出了市区的轮廓，街道两旁楼房高耸，新建面积已达十万多平方米。街上，牵着小马来购买商品的彝族农民熙熙攘攘，运货卡车来往不绝，十分热闹。下午，市内广播站向居民播送出悦耳的歌曲，系着红领巾的彝族儿童，三三两两的彝族工人，欢乐地走过街头。美姑、布拖、甘洛、瓦岗、普雄等县城，原来都是只有十几户甚至几户人家的村落，现在都已拥有两三条漂亮街道，人口上千。部分区、乡也建设起了新城镇。美姑县的巴普，解放前只有两户人家，连年不断的冤家械斗，这里和外界几乎断绝往来，民主改革后，两条公路通车到这里，工厂、商店、学校、医院相继建立，冷僻山沟立即变成了热闹市镇。这里现在已经有一百多幢新建房屋，一千一百多居民，车辆来往频繁，人马杂踏，一片兴旺、繁荣景象。
    这些新兴城镇，是凉山地区各项建设飞跃发展的结果，给彝族人民带来了幸福和繁荣。各个新城镇的贸易公司里，出售有千种以上的商品，人们可以随心所欲地买到自己需用的东西。通过这些城镇，每月平均将总值一百多万元的各种商品供应给彝族人民。时新花布，绒衣、搪瓷用具、毛巾香皂等，已经是人们普遍购用的日用品了。随着生产的发展和群众生活的不断改善，商品销售额不断上升，市面日趋繁荣。今年上半年各新城镇的销售总额已达一千一百多万元。超过了民主改革前同时期的50％多。过去购买商品需要翻山越岭到汉族地区的集镇或是忍受来往商贩的重利盘剥，大量土特产品没有销路；现在已经以各个新兴城镇为中心，联系着遍布农村的四百多个供销点，形成了贸易购销网。新兴的巴普镇每月进出物资的总值已达数万元，成为山区的物资集散地。
    新建的几条公路和许多驿道，从四面八方通向各个新城镇，城乡之间、大小凉山与汉族地区紧密连接起来，大批机器、建筑材料、日用百货，沿着公路，源源不断运到。凉山土特产品也运销到外区。各个新城镇正在建设成为当地的工业基地，全州有五十多座国营工厂分布在新兴城镇里，每座新城都在去年新建两三座以上的工厂，直接为当地农业生产服务。昭觉城已经有铁工厂、机械厂、汽车修配厂、水泥厂等好几座工厂建成投入生产。这些新兴的城镇，都有电影放映队、文化馆、医院、学校。大批彝族儿童正在这里读书，新城镇正在为彝族人民培养第一代有文化的人。
