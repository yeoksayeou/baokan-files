Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: The Yuecheng Reservoir on the Zhang River, the largest engineering project in the overall harnessing of the Hai River, will begin large-scale construction. People's communes in various parts of Hebei are fully demonstrating their immense power, organizing manpower and transporting materials from all directions to support the reservoir's major construction effort, striving to control floods by the next flood season.

This reservoir is located on the Zhang River southwest of Yuecheng Town, Ci County, Hebei Province. Historically, the Zhang River has caused severe disasters to the people. After liberation, in 1956, the year with the most severe flooding, it inundated more than 10 million mu of land. After the reservoir is completed, it will not only eliminate the disasters of the Zhang River but also transform water hazards into water resources for the areas along the river in Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces and the areas along the downstream Nan Canal-Hai River, and it will play a crucial role in preventing flood threats to Tianjin. The main projects of the reservoir include the main dam, auxiliary dam, spillway tunnel, intake tower, and spillway. After completing the 3,700-meter-long and 51.5-meter-high main dam and the 1,900-meter-long auxiliary dam, the Zhang River will be cut off, forming an artificial lake with a capacity of 1.02 billion cubic meters. This lake can control an upstream drainage area of more than 17,900 square kilometers, irrigate 2.68 million mu of farmland downstream, and generate 10,000 kilowatts of electricity. The total earth and stone volume of the entire project is approximately 32 million cubic meters, and the total concrete volume reaches 375,000 cubic meters. The entire project is planned to meet the flood control standards before the next flood season and be fully completed before the flood season of 1961.

The news that the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee had decided to build the Yuecheng Reservoir, start major construction in November this year, and begin flood control next year spread quickly, and the people downstream of the Zhang River told each other the good news, cheering that their long-held hopes were about to become a reality. Many commune members, recalling the past disasters caused by the Zhang River, increased their determination to conquer the Zhang River and eagerly signed up to contribute to the construction of the reservoir. The people upstream of the Zhang River were also jubilant about the construction of this project. They believe that after the Zhang River is completely harnessed, agricultural production will be more secure, and the interests of the people throughout the province are their own interests, and they have requested to join the labor force. Countless water conservancy construction engineers and technicians, as well as migrant workers and cadres who have participated in the construction of large reservoirs, have actively requested their leaders to approve their support for the reservoir construction.

The resounding slogan of "Support the Yuecheng Reservoir" has inspired the broad masses of commune members. The commune members of the people's communes have demonstrated a lofty communist spirit. Many communes and teams, even if they have some difficulties in their own production, actively organize forces to support the construction of the reservoir. The commune members who stayed behind expressed to the migrant workers that they would "do the work of two people," redouble their efforts, and take on the work at home. When the migrant workers departed, people steamed dry food and prepared tools, wholeheartedly wanting to ensure that the migrant workers worked well. Women automatically organized themselves to make cotton clothes, shoes, and socks for the migrant workers, and to take apart and wash bedding.

At present, the preparatory work for the construction of this reservoir is being accelerated. More than 100,000 migrant workers from Handan Prefecture have marched to the construction site in a mighty manner. More than 70,000 migrant workers in Tianjin are also ready to go. The migrant workers who have arrived at the construction site are all determined and full of energy. More than 8,000 migrant workers from Nangong County have posted more than 30,000 big-character posters, expressing their determination to contribute to the construction of the Yuecheng Reservoir. The battle sheds of the entire reservoir construction site are scattered like stars, the water conservancy street, three *li* long and more than 20 meters wide, has been built, and seven transportation roads, more than 8,800 meters long, have been newly built, and 25 bridges have been erected. The work of clearing the foundation is also being rushed day and night.

The central and Hebei provincial leading organs attach great importance to the construction of this project. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have organized a working group to support the Yuecheng Reservoir. Various central departments have allocated a large number of infrastructure materials to support the reservoir construction work.

    兴建岳城水库驯服漳河
    据新华社天津讯　根治海河中工程量最大的漳河岳城水库，将大规模地动工兴建。河北各地人民公社正在充分显示自己的巨大威力，从四面八方组织人力、赶运物资，支援水库大动工，力争明年汛期拦洪。
    这个水库位于河北省磁县岳城镇西南漳河之上。漳河在历史上给人民带来严重灾害。解放后在水灾最严重的1956年，曾淹没土地一千多万亩。水库建成后，不仅可以消除漳河的灾害，对冀、豫、鲁三省沿河地区及其下游南运河——海河沿岸农田变水害为水利，对免除天津水害威胁，都有极重要作用。水库的主要工程分为主坝、副坝、泄洪洞、进水塔、溢洪道等。完成三千七百米长、五十一点五米高的主坝和一千九百米长的副坝后，将拦腰斩断漳河，成为一个容量十点二亿立方米的人工湖。这个湖能控制上游流域面积一万七千九百多平方公里，灌溉下游二百六十八万亩农田，还能发电一万瓩。全部工程土石方总量约三千二百万立方米，混凝土方总量达三十七点五万立方米。整个工程计划在明年汛前达到拦洪标准，1961年汛期前全部完成。
    中共河北省委和省人民委员会确定兴建岳城水库、并确定今年11月大动工、明年开始拦洪的消息传出后，漳河下游人民奔走相告，欢呼多年愿望即将变为现实。许多社员从回忆过去遭受漳水的祸害当中，增长了治服漳河的决心，争先恐后报名，要为兴修水库立功。漳河上游的人民，也为兴建这个工程欢欣鼓舞。他们认为，根治漳河以后，农业生产更有保障，全省人民的利益，就是自己的利益，纷纷要求参加民工队伍。无数水利建设的工程技术人员和参加过大水库建设的民工、干部们，主动要求领导上批准他们去支援水库建设。
    “支援岳城水库去”的响亮口号，激励着广大社员，人民公社的社员表现了崇高的共产主义风格，许多社、队，即使本社、本队生产上有些困难，也积极组织力量支援兴建水库。留下来的社员向民工表示：要做到“一顶二”，加倍努力，包下家里的活。在民工出发的时候，人们蒸干粮、备工具，一心要使民工劳动好。妇女们自动组织起来，为民工赶做棉衣、鞋袜，拆洗被褥。
    目前，这个水库动工准备工作正在加紧进行。邯郸专区已有十万多名民工浩浩荡荡开赴工地。天津市也有七万多名民工整装待发。现在到达工地的民工们，人人决心大，个个干劲足，南宫县的八千多名民工就贴出大字报三万多张，表示要为修建岳城水库立功。整个水库工地战斗工棚星罗棋布，三华里长、二十多米宽的水利大街已经建成，并且新修好八千八百多米长的七条运输公路，架好二十五座桥梁。清理地基的工作也在日夜突击。
    中央和河北省领导机关，很重视这一工程的兴建。省委和省人民委员会已组织了支援岳城水库的工作团。中央各部门已经拨给大批基建器材，支援水库建设工作。
