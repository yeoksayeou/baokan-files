    Unmasking the True Face of "Household Responsibility System"
    By People's Daily Commentator
    People's communes, with their powerful collective strength, are driving wave after wave of production upsurge, and also propelling the entire society of our country forward with great momentum. This is the mainstream of China's rural areas in 1959. The progress of history always involves struggle. The dross of the times is always unwilling to move forward, always wanting to block the path of advancement.
    In the two years of 1958 and 1959, how far has our country's history progressed! The original more than 700,000 agricultural production cooperatives have been transformed into more than 24,000 people's communes that are many times more powerful – "larger in size and with a higher degree of public ownership." However, in the previous period, the ghost of capitalism appeared, trying to drag people back to the old path of "smaller in size and with a lower degree of public ownership" mutual aid teams or individual farming. Of course, "mutual aid teams" are already outdated, and the term "individual farming" has long become very unseemly and cannot be openly brought out. In order to deceive people, they took advantage of the rectification of communes and the implementation of contracted work and output quotas to play the trick of passing off fish eyes as pearls, replacing the old and corrupt goods with some seemingly more fashionable cloaks, called: "land devolution," "contracting output quotas to households," "contracting all or most farm work to households," "assigning fields to households," "field section responsibility system," and so on. Although this is only a small adverse current, its nature should not be ignored. This phenomenon shows that the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads is still going on in the countryside.
    What will "contracting output quotas to households" lead to? Please take a look at this stark contrast: In the airport management area of ​​Wanzhai Commune, Xuanen County, Hubei Province, there are two production teams not far apart. One insists on collective production, and the production tasks are completed very well; the other "devolves land" and "contracts output quotas to households," and the production is a mess. The good team is the Fifth Team, which has poor natural conditions. However, the team's leaders resolutely rely on the poor peasants, and the collective ideology of the members is constantly growing. The whole team is united and motivated, and all production activities are at the forefront. In the struggle against drought, in addition to fixing a small number of laborers to specialize in collective sideline production, the remaining labor force concentrated on fighting the drought and strengthening field management. As a result, in the case of severe drought, the rice and corn harvests were still very good; in terms of sideline production, the income for seven months was more than 20 yuan per household. The bad team is the Eleventh Team, which has a lower terrain, and the soil, water source, and other conditions are better than those of the Fifth Team; however, the team's leaders only listened to the words of some rich middle peasants. The team's organization was lax, and the enthusiasm was insufficient. In addition to allocating forage land to members according to regulations, they also allocated a lot of land to "devolve" to members for personal management. Poor peasant members raised objections several times, but the captain did not listen. During the drought, the paddy fields cracked within a few days, and even the spring water on the edge of the fields was not used, resulting in a very low harvest. In terms of sideline production, there was no income at all.
    "Contracting output quotas to households" is an extremely backward, regressive, and reactionary practice. Regions that have done so have not only suffered losses in production, but also caused serious consequences in terms of economy, politics, and ideology. Li Chunrong of Fancun Brigade, Xishang Commune, Qinyang County, Xinxiang area, Henan Province, after the local implementation of "contracting work and fixing output quotas to households," went to engage in commercial speculation and hired short-term workers to farm. Yao Changkun and others, wealthy middle peasants in Linru County, Luoyang area, after the local implementation of "contracting work and output quotas to households," carved their names on bricks and buried them on the land boundaries, saying that this was "returning the land to its old home." The anti-socialist activities of rich peasants and some rich middle peasants became rampant again for a time.
    Right-leaning opportunist proposals and activities such as "contracting output quotas to households" were opposed by the vast number of poor peasants and most grassroots cadres as soon as they emerged. However, right-leaning opportunists remained stubbornly unrepentant. They used various disguises and thought of various "reasons" to find outlets for the anti-socialist private goods of the bourgeoisie and some rich middle peasants. The biggest reason for those who advocate "contracting output quotas to households" is that doing so can "improve the production enthusiasm of farmers." Look at the above examples, what kind of "enthusiasm" is this doing to improve, and whose "enthusiasm" is it improving? They are also keen to "fix this practice for a long time," saying it is to "make people and land feel affection." Look, what kind of affection is this trying to cultivate? This will only make some people feel affection for capitalism! It will only undermine people's lofty feelings for socialist collectivism! Some people advocate "dividing plots of land and contracting all or most of the farm work to households," saying that this can "strengthen the sense of responsibility of the members for production" and is to "carry the responsibility system to the end." When people pointed out that this was turning back to the road of individual farming, they said: "This does not affect ownership, it is only a matter of production management," "it is only a form of division of labor and cooperation in collective production," "the field section responsibility system is not only not turning back to the road of individual farming, but also more conducive to developing production and consolidating and improving the people's commune." In fact, since all or most of the farm work is contracted to households, and all or most of the work points are also fixed to households, the production unit is still reduced to individual households. May I ask, what "division of labor and cooperation in collective production" is there to speak of? How much difference is there between this and individual ownership? To call this "conducive to consolidating and improving the people's commune" is actually the most vicious destruction and slander of the people's commune. Those who advocate doing so vigorously promote its "superiority," saying that the "benefits" of doing so are that "a family has men and women, old and young, and can do heavy and light work, rough and skillful work; a family's living time is consistent, and their actions are consistent; it can improve the sense of responsibility of each member and improve labor efficiency." What should be done if a family's men, women, old, and young are not so "complete"? It is said that "they can voluntarily combine, divide plots of land, and exchange work with each other." So it turns out that "mutual aid teams" are here again. However, how can labor be uniformly dispatched on a large scale? How can the collective strength be guaranteed to transform nature and reform technology? The actions of a family are consistent, but how can the actions of a team be guaranteed to be consistent? The "sense of responsibility" for small plots of land may be strengthened, but what about the sense of responsibility for the collective cause of the entire commune? Obviously, these are all reactionary fallacies that can be exposed with one poke.
    In the people's commune, should we contract work and output quotas? Should we implement the responsibility system? Yes, we should. Under the condition that the ownership of the production team is the basis, the production team, on the one hand, must obey the unified leadership and management of the entire commune, and on the other hand, can take the production team as the unit for contracting work and output quotas. This is in line with the principle of graded leadership and graded management. "Contracting output quotas to households" is a completely different matter from contracting work and output quotas to small teams. It is permissible to contract a small part of the scattered field management work that does not require organized collective labor to the members; however, this part of the farm work only accounts for a small part of the entire production labor, and it can never be the majority, let alone all of it; it can only be short-term and temporary, and it cannot be long-term and fixed. "Contracting all or most of the farm work to households" is also a completely different matter from the responsibility system for a small part of the odd jobs. Collective management is the basic management method of the people's commune under collective ownership. The management of household sideline occupations and feed land can only be placed in an extremely secondary and supplementary position; collective labor is always the basic labor method of the people's commune. With the improvement of production tools and management level, the farm work suitable for being contracted to members to do alone will become less and less. Such principles must not be shaken in the slightest, and there must not be any violation of them. Labor management and contracting work and output quotas in people's communes are not simply matters of method and technology, but major political issues involving production relations, and are an important battlefield in the struggle between the two roads. Right-leaning opportunists always want to take advantage of these loopholes, and we must be vigilant. The boundaries must be clearly defined, and the positions must be firmly guarded.
    When the Party and the masses rise up to oppose and stop this right-leaning activity of "contracting output quotas to households" by right-leaning opportunists, they still want to "leave a point and compare it." Individual farming has had thousands of years of history, and it has also been "compared" with cooperation for many years, all of which have proved that it will only drag farmers into the abyss of poverty. What else is there to "try"? What else is there to "compare"? This poisonous weed must be uprooted and burned thoroughly, and not a single "point" is allowed to be left! People know that not to mention the essence of practices such as "contracting output quotas to households," even the ghostly names such as "contracting output quotas to households" are not very new things. In 1957, in some places, this ghost appeared, some called "three guarantees to households," and some called "distributing fields according to labor and contracting output quotas to households." Wherever these practices appeared, an irreconcilable contradiction immediately arose with unified management, planned production was reduced to nothing, unified distribution also became empty talk, the collective ownership of the means of production in essence underwent a backward change to individual ownership, and some rich middle peasants took the opportunity to conceal output and resist the unified purchase and sale of grain, and black market activities increased substantially. Obviously, this is the ghost of capitalism. Some rich middle peasants applauded it; poor and lower-middle peasants were filled with indignation and resolutely opposed it. Under the leadership of the Party, in the great debate on the two roads, this ghost was quickly driven away.
    The ghost of capitalism has not dissipated, or it has dissipated and reunited. In the previous period, when a few dark clouds floated in the sky again, it came again. Of course, it is insignificant in the face of the powerful people's commune, but no matter how small it is, it is always harmful to socialism; as long as it appears, we must fight against it and subdue it. To subdue it is not difficult, the best way is to develop the collective strength to be strong and strong, and to make collective production vigorous and solid.

    揭穿“包产到户”的真面目
    本报评论员
    人民公社以强大的集体力量，推动着一浪高一浪的生产高潮，也推动着我国整个社会奔腾前进。这是1959年我国农村的主流。历史的前进，总是要经过斗争的。时代的渣滓，总是不肯前进，总是想要阻挡前进的道路。
    1958年，1959年，两年间，我国的历史已经进展了多么远！原来的七十多万个农业生产合作社，已经转化为二万四千多个强大不知多少倍的“一大二公”的人民公社。可是，前一个时期，曾经出现了资本主义的幽灵，要把人们拖回“一小二私”的互助组或者单干户的老路上去。当然，“互助组”早已过时了，“单干”这个名称更早已变得很不雅观了，不好公然拿出来了。为了迷惑人，他们就借着整顿公社和实行包工包产的机会，大耍鱼目混珠的把戏，给陈旧了腐败了的货色换上一些看来似乎比较时兴的外衣，叫做：“土地下放”，“包产到户”，“全部或大部农活包工到户”，“定田到户”，“地段责任制”等等。这虽然只是一股小小的逆流，但就其性质来说，却决不可忽视。这种现象说明，当前在农村中，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争仍在进行。
    “包产到户”会得到什么结果呢？请先看看这个鲜明的对比：湖北宣恩县万寨公社机场管理区有两个相隔不远的生产小队，一个坚持集体生产，生产任务完成得很好；另一个“土地下放”、“包产到户”，生产搞得一团糟。好的队是五小队，自然条件不好，可是，队的领导干部坚决依靠贫农，社员的集体主义思想不断增长，全队团结一致，干劲很大，样样生产活动走在前面。在抗旱斗争中，除固定少部分劳动力专门从事集体的副业生产以外，其余劳动力都集中力量抗旱，加强田间管理，结果在严重干旱的情况下，水稻和玉米的收成仍然很好；副业方面，七个月的收入，每户就可分得二十多元。糟糕的队是十一小队，地势较低，土壤、水源等条件都比五小队好；可是，队的领导干部只听信部分富裕中农的话，队里组织涣散，干劲不足，他们除了按照规定分给社员饲料地以外，还拨出很多土地“下放”给社员个人经营。贫农社员几次提意见，队长不听。在抗旱期间，稻田几天之内就干裂了口，连田边的泉水也没有利用，收成很低。在副业方面，一分钱收入也没有。
    “包产到户”是极端落后、倒退、反动的做法，凡是这样做了的地区，不止在生产上造成了损失，在经济上、政治上、思想上都引起了严重的后果。河南新乡地区沁阳县西尚公社范村大队有个李春荣，在当地实行“包工定产到户”以后，自己去搞商业投机活动，另雇短工种地。洛阳地区临汝县富裕中农姚长坤等，在当地实行“包工包产到户”以后，就用砖刻上名字埋在地界上，并且说这就是“土地还老家”。富农和部分富裕中农的反社会主义的活动，一时又猖狂起来。
    “包产到户”之类的右倾机会主义的主张和活动，在它们刚一出头露面的时候，就碰到广大贫苦农民和大部分基层干部的反对。可是，右倾机会主义者仍然顽固不化，他们用种种伪装、想种种“理由”，为资产阶级和部分富裕中农反社会主义的私货寻找销路。主张“包产到户”的人的最大的理由，就是说这样做可以“提高农民的生产积极性”。看看上面的这些例子吧，这样做，究竟是提高了什么样的“积极性”，提高了什么人的“积极性”？他们还热中于把这种做法“长期固定下来”，说是为了“要人和土地发生感情”。看看吧，这究竟是要培养一种什么样的感情？这只会使一些人对资本主义充满感情！只会破坏人们对社会主义集体主义的崇高感情！有人主张“划分地段，把全部或大部农活包工到户”，说这样可以“加强社员对生产的责任心”，是把“责任制一竿子插到底”。当人们纷纷指出这是回头走单干道路的时候，他们又说：“这不影响所有制，只是生产管理的方法问题”，“只是集体生产中一种分工合作的形式”，“地段责任制不仅不是走单干的回头路，而且更利于发展生产，巩固与提高人民公社”。实际上，既然是把全部或大部农活包工到户，全部或大部工分也固定到户，也就仍然是把生产单位缩小为单家独户。试问，这有什么“集体生产中的分工合作”可言呢？这同个体所有制究竟有多大区别呢？居然把这也叫做“有利于巩固与提高人民公社”，这实际上是对人民公社最恶毒的破坏和污蔑。主张这样做的人大肆宣扬它的“优越性”，据说这样做的“好处”是“一家人有男有女、有老有少，对重活轻活、粗活巧活都能做；一家人生活时间一致，行动一致；可以提高每个社员的责任心，提高劳动效率”。一家人男女老少不那末“齐备”的，该怎么办呢？据说，“可以自愿结合，划分地段，互相换工。”原来是“互助组”又来了。可是，劳动力怎样在大范围内统一调度呢？怎样保证用集体的力量改造自然、改革技术呢？一家人的行动一致了，而一队人的行动又怎样保证一致呢？对小块地的“责任心”可能是加强了，而对全社集体事业的责任心又会如何呢？显然，这都是一些一戳就穿的反动谬论。
    在人民公社里，要不要包工包产呢？要不要实行责任制呢？要的。在以生产队的所有权为基础的情况下，生产队一方面要服从全社的统一领导、统一管理，一方面可以把生产小队作为包工包产单位。这是符合分级领导、分级管理的原则的。“包工包产到户”，同小队的包工包产是性质完全不同的两回事。田间管理中有一小部分零星分散的、不需要组织集体劳动的农活包给社员个人来做，这是允许的；可是，这部分农活只占整个生产用工的一小部分，决不可能是大部，更不可能是全部；只可能是短期的临时的，而不可能是长期的固定的。“全部或大部农活包工到户”，同小部分零活的责任制也是性质完全不同的两回事。集体经营是集体所有制的人民公社的基本的经营方式，家庭副业和饲料地的经营只能放在极其次要的、补助的地位；集体劳动永远是人民公社的基本的劳动方式，随着生产工具和管理水平的提高，适于包给社员个人单独做的农活必将越来越少。这样的原则决不能有丝毫动摇，决不能有一点违背。人民公社的劳动管理、包工包产，并不简单地是方法问题、技术问题，而是涉及生产关系的重大政治问题，是两条道路斗争的一个重要战场。右倾机会主义者总是想在这些地方钻空子，必须谨防。界线必须划清，阵地必须固守。
    当党和群众起来反对和制止右倾机会主义分子的这种“包产到户”的右倾活动的时候，他们还要“留个点，比比看”。单干，已有几千年的历史了，以后又和合作化“比”了好多年，都证明了只会把农民拖向贫苦的深渊，还要“试”什么？还要“比”什么？这种毒草必须连根拔掉，通统烧毁，一个“点”也不许留！人们知道，不要说“包产到户”之类的做法的实质了，就连“包产到户”之类的鬼名称，也不是多么新鲜的东西。在1957年，在一些地方，这个阴魂就出现过，有的叫做“三包到户”，有的叫做“按劳分田，包产到户”。凡是出现了这些做法的地方，就立即同统一经营发生了不可调和的矛盾，计划生产归于乌有，统一分配也成了空谈，生产资料集体所有制在实质上发生了向个体所有制倒退的变化，部分富裕中农乘机隐瞒产量，对抗粮食统购统销，黑市活动大量增加。很明显，这是资本主义的阴魂。部分富裕中农对它鼓掌欢迎；贫农、下中农则气愤填膺坚决反对。在党的领导下，在两条道路的大辩论中，很快就把这个阴魂赶跑了。
    资本主义的阴魂未散，或者散而复聚。前一个时期，当天空又有几片乌云飘动的时候，它就又来了。当然，它在强大的人民公社面前，是微不足道的，可是无论它是多么微小，总是对社会主义有害的；只要它一出现，就一定要同它斗争，制服它。要制服它，不难，最好的办法就是把集体力量发扬得强大而又强大，把集体生产搞得轰轰烈烈、结结实实。
