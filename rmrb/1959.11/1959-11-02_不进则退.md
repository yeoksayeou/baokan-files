    Not to Advance is to Retreat
    Shang Zhen
    "Sailing against the current, not to advance is to retreat." This sentence vividly describes a dialectical law of development. This law is objectively present in both nature and society.
    This objective law, reflected in the history of social development, poses a fundamental question to people: is it continuous revolution that propels society forward, or continuous regression that pulls society backward? How one answers this question is the touchstone for distinguishing whether a person or a group is a revolutionary or a counter-revolutionary, a thorough revolutionary or an incomplete revolutionary.
    The wheel of history is constantly moving forward. Throughout history, any emerging class in a society has always pushed society forward and become the revolutionary force of the time; while the declining class of the same society has always妄想to pull the wheel of history backward in an attempt to save itself from extinction, becoming the counter-revolutionary force of the time.
    Every ruling class, when it is still in the position of an emerging class, represents new productive forces, breaks through the shackles of the old relations of production, and has a certain degree of revolutionary nature. It can lead or participate in revolution. At the same time, it is always wary of and exploits the vast number of exploited laborers. Therefore, in the development of the revolution, it always shows колебанияand incompleteness towards the revolution. When social productive forces continue to develop and the relations of production need to continue to change, the exploiting class, which originally had колебанияand incompleteness towards the revolution, transforms into a reactionary class. Its revolutionary nature turns into its opposite, and it tries its best to adopt various reactionary policies and measures to缓和the revolutionary struggle or suppress the revolutionary movement, to prevent society from advancing, which in fact is to pull society backward. Therefore, no exploiting class can become a thorough revolutionary.
    Only the modern proletariat, which does not exploit anyone, demands the elimination of all exploiting classes, the abolition of all exploiting systems, demands that society always move forward and never backward, and demands that social productive forces be able to develop rapidly and continuously. Therefore, it demands that the social relations of production be reformed in a timely and continuous manner. Therefore, the proletarian revolutionaries are the most thorough revolutionaries.
    In the period of democratic revolution, the proletariat demands to carry the democratic revolution through to the end, so as to transition to the socialist revolution in a timely manner; in the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the proletariat demands to carry socialism through to the end, to thoroughly liberate and highly develop social productive forces, so as to transition from socialist society to communist society in a timely manner. Therefore, the proletariat and its political party—the Communist Party—are both stage theorists and continuous revolution theorists of revolutionary development. It is unambiguous about the qualitative differences in each historical stage of revolutionary development, and confusing revolutionary stages of different natures is incompatible with the political line of the Communist Party. At the same time, the Communists believe that the various stages of revolutionary development are interconnected and closely related, with the previous stage preparing for the next stage, and the next stage being a continuation and development of the previous stage, always贯串的the process from quantitative change to qualitative change. The stages of revolutionary development are one after another, continuously and endlessly developing forward.
    Within a certain historical period, for example, within the historical period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, from the perspective of the overall historical period, it is a process of quantitative change, but in the entire process of this quantitative change, it also contains several partial qualitative changes. Although these partial qualitative changes cannot change the basic socialist nature of the entire historical period, they can promote the socialist revolution to develop wave after wave, thereby forming several small stages within the socialist revolutionary period.
    Now we can look back at the experience of the past ten years since the founding of the country. Without the land reform in the countryside and the democratic reform in the cities, it would have been impossible to completely eliminate the economic foundation and political forces of feudalism, thereby paving the way for socialist revolution and construction; without the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the elimination of counter-revolutionaries, and the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements, it would have been impossible to crush the stubborn resistance and rampant attacks of the reactionary forces and the bourgeoisie against the socialist cause; without the agricultural cooperativization, the handicraft cooperativization, and the joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce, it would have been impossible to achieve the basic victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front; without the whole-Party rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, it would have been impossible to achieve the victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts; in the final analysis, without such a series of revolutionary mass movements, it would have been impossible for the social productive forces of our country to be thoroughly liberated and rapidly developed. But at every critical moment of the revolutionary movement, there is always a counter-current, and there are always some people standing outside the movement,指手划脚, saying that the movement is "terrible." These "terrible" factions are actually "promoters of retreat." According to their views, the revolutionary boat can only go with the flow and甘居the lower reaches, but cannot go against the current and strive for the upper reaches.
    With the rapid development of social productive forces, in 1958, a new situation of great leaps forward in industry, agriculture, and various socialist construction undertakings emerged in our country. At the same time, under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of peasants felt that the original agricultural cooperatives could no longer adapt to the needs of production development. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party, they dared to think, dared to speak, and dared to act, creating the people's commune, an organizational form with great historical significance. The Party Central Committee and the great leader Chairman Mao summed up and promoted the experience of the people's commune. Because this experience came from the masses and was suitable for the needs of the masses and production, the people's commune was realized in rural areas throughout the country in less than two months. The unprecedented great leap in production and the nationwide people's communeization were the great miracles created by the Chinese people in 1958. This miracle made the revolutionaries happy, shocked the reactionaries, and also made a small number of Right opportunists in our party惶恐uneasy. At such a critical juncture in historical development, it can be seen more clearly who is the promoter and who is the promoter of retreat. The Right opportunists believed that the people's communeization was "a mess," the agricultural Great Leap Forward was "bragging," and the industrial Great Leap Forward centered on large-scale steelmaking was "not worth the loss" and was a "wrong movement." They viciously诬蔑the earth-shattering revolutionary movement in 1958 as a "political mistake" of "Left adventurism" caused by "petty-bourgeois fanaticism." The facts are very clear. Here are two different political lines and two different political directions: the Marxists and Leninists advocate relying closely on the working class and the broad masses of working people, holding high the red flag and advancing victoriously, quickly changing the "poor and blank" face of our country, and building our country into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as quickly as possible; while the Right opportunists诬蔑the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working class and the broad masses of working people as "petty-bourgeois fanaticism," and advocate violating the revolutionary will of the working class and the broad masses of working people,改弦更张, and turning right and backward, returning to the old road of capitalism.
    The question now facing us is: anti-Rightist and boost morale, or anti-"rash advance" and泄morale? Is it to ride the wind and waves and strive for the upper reaches, or to掩旗息鼓 and flee with abandon? There is no middle ground. Ideas and statements such as "maintain the status quo," "slow is better than fast," "neither strive to be first nor fall behind," and "任凭wind and waves rise, sit steadily in the fishing boat," if not ideologically糊涂, are the self-deceiving幌子of Right opportunists, because objective laws are unforgiving: "Sailing against the current, not to advance is to retreat."

    不进则退
    尚真
    “逆水行舟，不进则退”。这句话非常通俗地描述了一种辩证的发展规律。这种规律，在自然界和社会中都是客观存在的。
    这种客观规律反映到社会发展历史上，向人们提出了一个根本性质的问题，是不断革命把社会推向前进，还是不断倒退把社会拉向后转？如何回答这个问题，是辨别一个人或一个人群是革命派还是反革命派、是彻底的革命派还是不彻底的革命派的试金石。
    历史的车轮不断地向前运转着。历史上任何一个社会的新兴的阶级，总是要把社会推向前进而成为当时的革命派；而同一社会的没落阶级，总是妄想把历史车轮拉向后转，来挽救自己的灭亡，成为当时的反革命派。
    历来的统治阶级，当它还处在新兴阶级的地位的时候，代表着新的生产力，突破旧的生产关系的束缚，它是有一定的革命性的，它可以领导革命或者参加革命；与此同时，它对于被剥削的广大劳动者，则总是心存戒备，加以利用；因此在革命的发展中，它又总是表现着对革命的动摇性和不彻底性。当着社会生产力继续向前发展，生产关系需要继续变革的时候，原来对革命就具有动摇性和不彻底性的剥削阶级，就转化为反动阶级。它的革命性就走向自己的反面，而竭力采取和缓革命斗争或镇压革命运动的各种反动政策和措施，来阻止社会前进，实际上就是要把社会拉向后退。因此，任何一个剥削阶级，都不可能成为彻底的革命派。
    只有现代的无产阶级，它不剥削任何人，它要求消灭一切剥削阶级，废除一切剥削制度，它要求社会永远向前进而不向后退，它要求社会生产力能够迅速地不断地发展，因此，它要求社会的生产关系能够适时地不断地进行改革。因此，无产阶级的革命家，是最彻底的革命家。
    在民主革命时期，无产阶级要求把民主革命进行到底，以便适时地转到社会主义革命；在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，无产阶级要求把社会主义进行到底，彻底解放和高度发展社会生产力，以便适时地由社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会。因此，无产阶级及其政党——共产党，既是革命发展的阶段论者，又是不断革命论者。它对于革命发展每个历史阶段的质的区别是毫不含糊的，把不同性质的革命阶段混淆起来，是和共产党的政治路线不相容的。同时，共产党人认为，革命发展的各个阶段是互相衔接和密切联系的，上一阶段为下一阶段作准备，下一阶段又是上一阶段的继续和发展，始终贯串着由量变到质变的过程。革命的发展阶段是一个接着一个，不间断地永无休止地向前发展。
    在一定的历史时期以内，例如在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的历史时期以内，就整个历史时期的全局说来，是一个量变的过程，但在这一个量变的全部过程中，也包含着若干局部的质变，这些局部的质变虽不能改变整个历史时期的社会主义的基本性质，却能够推动社会主义革命一浪高一浪地向前发展，从而形成社会主义革命时期内的若干小的阶段。
    现在我们可以回顾一下，建国十年来的经历，如果没有农村的土地改革和城市的民主改革，就不可能彻底消灭封建主义的经济基础和政治势力，从而为社会主义的革命和建设开辟道路；如果没有镇反、肃反和三反、五反运动，就不可能粉碎反动势力和资产阶级向社会主义事业的顽强反抗和猖狂进攻；如果没有农业合作化、手工业合作化和资本主义工商业的公私合营，就不可能在经济战线上取得社会主义革命的基本胜利；如果没有全民整风和反右派斗争，就不可能在政治战线和思想战线上取得社会主义革命的胜利；归根到底，如果没有这么一系列的革命的群众运动，就不可能使我国的社会生产力得到彻底解放和迅速发展。但在每一个革命运动的紧要关头，总有一股逆流，总有一些人站在运动之外，指手划脚，把运动说成“糟得很”。这些“糟得很”派，实际就是“促退派”，按照他们的主张，革命之舟，只能顺流而下，甘居下游，而不能逆流而上，力争上游。
    随着社会生产力的迅速发展，1958年在我国出现了工业、农业和各项社会主义建设事业大跃进的新局面。同时，在大跃进的形势下，广大农民群众，感到原来的农业合作社已经不能适应生产发展的需要，因而在党的领导下，敢想、敢说、敢干，创造了人民公社这一具有伟大历史意义的组织形式。党中央和伟大的领袖毛主席，总结和推广了人民公社的经验。由于这种经验是从群众中来的，是适合群众要求和生产需要的，所以不到两个月的功夫，就实现了全国农村的人民公社化。史无前例的生产大跃进和全国规模的人民公社化，这是中国人民在1958年所创造的伟大奇迹。这种奇迹使革命派高兴，使反动派震惊，也使我们党内一小撮右倾机会主义分子惶恐不安。在这样的历史发展的紧要关头，谁是促进派，谁是促退派，就可以看得更加清楚了。右倾机会主义分子认为人民公社化“搞糟了”，农业大跃进是“吹牛”，以大办钢铁为中心的工业大跃进是“得不偿失”，是“错误的运动”。他们恶毒地诬蔑1958年惊天动地的革命运动，是由于“小资产阶级狂热性”而产生的“左倾冒险主义”的“政治性的错误”。事实非常清楚，在这里明明白白摆着两条不同的政治路线、两个不同的政治方向：马克思列宁主义者主张紧紧地依靠工人阶级和广大劳动群众，高举红旗胜利前进，迅速改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌，尽可能快地把我国建成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家；而右倾机会主义者却把工人阶级和广大劳动群众的革命热情，诬蔑为“小资产阶级狂热性”，主张违背工人阶级和广大劳动群众的革命意志，改弦更张，来一个向右转、向后转，回到资本主义的老路上去。
    现在摆在我们面前的问题是：反右倾、鼓干劲，还是反“冒进”、泄干劲？是乘风破浪、力争上游，还是掩旗息鼓，弃甲曳兵而逃？中间的道路是没有的。“维持现状”，“慢比快好”，“不争先也不落后”，“任凭风浪起，稳坐钓鱼船”等类的想法和说法，如果不是思想糊涂，就是右倾机会主义者自欺欺人的幌子，因为，客观规律是不留情的：“逆水行舟，不进则退”。
