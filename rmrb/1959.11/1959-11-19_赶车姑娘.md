    Cart-Pulling Girl (and another poem)
    [Tujia Nationality] Hu Wenjiang
    The cartwheels turn,
    A Tujia girl is pulling a cart, hauling bricks,
    Her blue cotton clothes are embroidered with white lace,
    Her bright, sparkling eyes gaze ahead.

    The girl's silver bell-like singing
    Rings through the construction site all day long;
    Rows of new factory buildings grow, grow,
    Reaching high into the blue sky.

    "Ah! This is so like an unfinished piece of embroidery,
    Embroidered on blue cloth."
    The girl marvels at the wondrous sight before her,
    Past days flash before her eyes:

    The girl loved to work since she was little,
    But generations had little to eat and wear,
    The kind-hearted girl embroidered hope on her lapel,
    Wishing the Tujia people a life like pomegranate flowers, blooming red.

    The past days are gone forever!
    The girl looks up and ahead,
    The Tujia people will live beneath a forest of chimneys,
    Pomegranate flowers will bloom on top of the chimneys.

    The girl sings even louder,
    Cracks of the whip slice across the blue sky,
    Childhood hopes are right before her,
    The wheels of the era turn faster and faster.

    On the Mengdong River
    The clear and bright Mengdong River,
    Reflects the moon's beautiful image,
    And a meeting with my beloved on the riverbank,
    My heart cannot be calm!

    We have been working together since we were little,
    And only when we grew up did we encounter such great times,
    A hydroelectric power station is built on the Mengdong River,
    We both contribute our greatest strength:

    I cut down rows of cedar trees,
    Made them into electric poles and planted them far away;
    He installed electric light bulbs, one by one,
    On the electric poles all the way to the distance.

    Today the hydroelectric power station is generating electricity,
    We meet again on the banks of the Mengdong River.
    Beside us, are rows of electric poles,
    Above us, are bright and shining electric lights.

    What illuminates the hearts of the Tujia people,
    Is the increasingly beautiful new life;
    What binds our love together,
    Is a working passion stronger than the electric current.

    The clear and bright Mengdong River,
    Reflects the beautiful lights,
    My beloved is coming soon,
    How can my heart be calm?

    赶车姑娘（外一首）
    〔土家族〕胡文江车轮子辘辘地转，一位土家族姑娘在赶车运砖，蓝粗布衣裳绣着白色花边，水灵灵的大眼望着前面。姑娘那银铃般的歌声整天在工地荡漾；一排排新厂房长啊长上了高高的蓝天。“呀！这多像一幅没有绣完的花边，绣在蓝布上面。”姑娘惊叹眼前的奇景，过去了的日子闪现在眼前：姑娘从小就爱劳动，祖祖辈辈却少吃缺穿，好心的姑娘把希望绣在衣襟上，愿土家人家生活像石榴花开放红灿灿。过去了的日子永远去了！姑娘抬头望着前面，土家人将生活在烟囱林下，一朵朵石榴花会开放在烟囱上边。姑娘的歌唱得更响了，一道道鞭影儿划过蓝蓝的天，小时候的希望就在眼前，时代的车轮飞快地转飞快地转。在猛洞河上明静的猛洞河，映着月亮的倩影，和心爱的人相会在河边，我的心不能平静！我和他从小在一块儿劳动，长大了才碰上大好时光，猛洞河边修起水电站，我俩都付出最大的力量：我把一排排杉树砍倒，做成电杆插到远方；他把一颗颗电灯泡，安在电杆上直到远方。今天水电站发电了，我俩相会在猛洞河边。身旁，是一根根电杆，头上，是一盏盏电灯光灿灿。把土家族人心里照亮了的，是越过越美的新生活；把我俩爱情结在一起的，是比电流还强烈的劳动激情。明静的猛洞河，映着美丽的灯影，心爱的人就要来了，我的心怎能平静？
