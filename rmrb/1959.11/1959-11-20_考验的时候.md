    "The lingering sound lingers for three days." This sentence is often used to describe beautiful and moving songs or performances. However, a good report does not just "linger for three days," but is remembered in the heart for three months, three years, or even a lifetime, and will always become the driving force for our progress. After listening to Comrade Xu Xuehui's report, this feeling is even deeper.
    On the same day that Comrade Xu Xuehui fought with the bandits, there were two other things: First, there was a consolation performance in the evening. Comrade Xu Xuehui gave up watching the play and voluntarily stayed on the farm. Second, she worked until two o'clock in the morning. Putting the events of the day together, it is not difficult to imagine the full picture of Comrade Xu Xuehui's fighting life. She treats everything in life with the attitude of a communist.
    Comrade Xu Xuehui is a hero of our time. She is loyal to the Party, listens to the Party's words at all times, loves the work the Party has given her, is conscientious and hardworking, and is full of energy. In down-to-earth work, in ordinary positions, she gradually cultivated extraordinary qualities. Therefore, in the face of severe tests, she was able to contribute a red heart of infinite loyalty to the Party and the people, and protect national wealth at the cost of her life. She was able to show the hard bones of a revolutionary and resolutely strike at class enemies.
    Some people say: "It is difficult to make any contribution in an ordinary position. Let's see when the test comes!" When we heard Comrade Xu Xuehui put her body on the money box and shouted for help regardless of life and death, and when we heard Comrade Xu Xuehui asked about the money box as the first thing after waking up from a coma, it was like a huge question mark, hitting our minds: If it were you, what would you do? Those who are "waiting for the test" may also want to think about it: If you are not willing to give your all even in normal times, can you dedicate your life when a bandit holds a knife to your chest? If you are always sluggish and lifeless in the face of every test, where does that noble revolutionary integrity come from in times of life and death? If you are just a fellow traveler of the Party in ordinary times, how can you immediately become a communist after a severe test? Therefore, that empty promise of "let's see when the test comes," that coward's excuse that thinks "ordinary" positions are useless, and that idea of regarding heroic behavior as "a tree without roots, water without a source," are truly self-defeating in the face of Comrade Xu Xuehui's glorious deeds, and appear so small and so despicable!
    To learn from Comrade Xu Xuehui, we must release our greatest light and heat in "ordinary" positions. We must always be full of energy, oppose Rightist tendencies thoroughly, and temper and test ourselves in the struggle to defend the Party's general line.

    考验的时候
    汪景元
    “余音绕梁，三日不绝。”这句话常被用来形容优美动听的歌曲或演唱。然而，一个好的报告，却不止是“三日不绝”，而是三月、三年，甚至终生铭记在心，永远成为我们奋发前进的动力。听过徐学惠同志的报告，这感觉就更深了。
    徐学惠同志与匪徒搏斗的当天，还有两件事情：第一件，晚上有慰问演出，徐学惠同志放弃了看戏，自动留在农场。第二件，她一直工作到深夜两点。把一天中的几件事联在一起，不难想见徐学惠同志战斗生活的全貌。她是以一个共产主义者的态度，来对待生活中每一件事情的。
    徐学惠同志是我们时代的英雄。她忠于党，时刻听党的话，热爱党交给自己的工作，兢兢业业，干劲冲天。在踏踏实实的工作中，在平凡的岗位上，慢慢地培养起不平凡的品质。因此，在严重考验的面前，她才能贡献出对党对人民无限忠诚的一颗红心，舍身保护国家财富。她才能拿出革命的硬骨头，坚决打击阶级敌人。
    有人说：“在平凡的岗位上，很难有什么贡献，到考验时瞧吧！”当我们听到徐学惠同志把身子伏在钱箱上，不顾生死大声呼援的时候，听到徐学惠同志从昏迷中醒来第一句便问起钱箱的时候，就好像有一个巨大的问号，敲打着自己的头脑：如果是你，会怎么样呢？那些“等待考验”的人，也不妨想一想：如果平时连干劲也不肯全拿出来，那么到匪徒用刀子抵住胸膛的时候，是否能献出自己的生命？如果在平时每一考验面前都表现得疲疲沓沓、毫无生气，那么在生死关头，那种高贵的革命气节从何而来呢？如果平时只是党的同路人，怎么会一经严酷的考验，立刻就变为共产主义者呢？因此，那种“到考验时瞧吧”的空洞的诺言，那种以为“平凡”的岗位无用武之地的懦者的借口，那种把英雄行为看作是“无本之木，无源之水”的想法，在徐学惠同志光辉事迹的面前，真是不攻自破，而且显得多么渺小、多么卑劣啊！
    要向徐学惠同志学习，就要在“平凡”的岗位上，放出自己最大的光和热。就要时时刻刻鼓足干劲，反透右倾，在保卫党的总路线的斗争中锻炼考验自己。
