    “Altruism”
    Meiyuan
    Ma Xueli, an advanced producer at the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, and others successfully trial-produced the "internal hole reamer." When people praised this achievement, they forgot about him, but he had no objections and remained enthusiastic. He said, "What I'm thinking about is how to do the work well and how to overfulfill the plan."
    Someone said to Zhang Mingzhi, the residents' director of Fuguo No. 2 Well in Liaoyuan Mine, Jilin: "You only get 7.25 yuan a month as a residents' director. Look at others, even illiterate women are getting 20-odd yuan. Why bother?" But she retorted, "Are we working to earn money?"
    There are no beautiful words here, but from these ordinary words, you can see the most beautiful and brightest heart! Today, in our country's working people, many similar examples can be found of the spirit of Ma Xueli and Zhang Mingzhi, who do not consider remuneration, conditions, or compete for honor in their work, and are completely selfless. We praise this spirit because it can and already has generated great material strength and created enormous wealth; it signifies that our country and nation has great aspirations, strong vitality, and beautiful hope.
    However, those imperialists and bourgeois elements whose souls have been infiltrated by the stench of money cannot understand this noble communist spirit of labor. They always wear colored glasses and insist that what they see is "slave labor." And the right-leaning opportunists, who are divorced from the masses, also fail to see the growth of communist thought among the working people. They oppose the system of combining supply system with wage system, oppose putting politics in command, and advocate putting money in command. How can they understand the communist spirit of labor among the people? The bourgeois philosophy of individualism is "Heaven punishes those who are not for themselves"!
    Marxism has always told us that communist labor is conscious and voluntary labor, labor without quotas, labor that does not expect personal honor, and labor that does not care about personal reward. The great revolutionary teacher Marx worked fifteen or sixteen hours a day, and often worked through the night. Could this kind of labor be calculated by quotas or measured by rewards? Those who have a proletarian revolutionary outlook on life have already abandoned all base interests. They live to work and labor for the people, and only death can stop them from working. Before their deaths, many revolutionary martyrs in enemy prisons still studied Marxist theory and conducted revolutionary education for their fellow prisoners. They did not seek wealth or comfort, but dedicated their most precious lives to the most magnificent cause of mankind.
    Our revolutionary predecessors, in the years of brutal struggle, dedicated everything they had to future generations. They ate grass, but squeezed out milk. This communist revolutionary spirit has been inherited and carried forward by their second generation today. In the era of socialist construction, it has become the communist spirit of labor, which does not consider remuneration, conditions, or compete for honor, and is completely selfless. The bourgeois individualist's outlook on life is vastly different from that of the working-class collectivist. For the sake of money, they "drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation" ("The Communist Manifesto"); for the sake of money, they habitually harm the public to benefit themselves, and harm others to benefit themselves. The working-class collectivist, on the other hand, considers being able to make the greatest possible contribution to the country and the people as the purpose of their lives. Their greatest pleasure is not when they receive personal honor, not when they receive material rewards, but when the collective receives honor and the country increases its wealth. The revolutionary working class has created the warmest and most loving relationship among class brothers and sisters and among working people that has never existed before.
    Recently, a famous Italian professor, Ruttorio Ruggeri, said: In recent years, the Chinese people have made great progress. If "there is no new concept of life, no social order of altruism to replace egoism, all this would be impossible." He believes that the Chinese people realize that they "no longer belong to an insignificant class that serves the interests of others. He is beginning to feel that he is the true master of his own destiny." This is well said. Although the meaning and essence of our "altruism" is much deeper and more profound than what he said. We have already mastered our own destiny. Under the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, we now have magnificent ideals—to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture and a modern science culture. This is the root cause of the increasing prevalence and development of altruism and the communist spirit of labor among the working people in our country.

    “利他主义”
    梅原
    武汉重型机床厂的先进生产者马学礼和别人一起试制成了“内孔稍胎”，人们在表扬这项成就时却把他忘了，但他毫无意见，仍然干劲十足。他说：“我想的，是怎样把工作搞好，怎样超额完成计划。”
    有人对吉林辽源矿富国二井居民主任张明芝说：“你这个居民主任每月才拿七元二角五，看人家，连一个大字也不识的妇女都拿二十来块，你何苦再操那份心呢！”她却反问：“咱们干工作是为了挣钱吗？”
    这里没有什么美丽的词藻，但从这些平凡的语言里，却可以看到一颗最美丽最晶亮的心！马学礼、张明芝这种在劳动里不计报酬、不讲条件、不争荣誉、大公无私的精神，今天在我们国家的劳动人民中，可以找到很多同样的例子。我们歌颂这种精神，因为它可以而且已经产生了伟大的物质力量，创造出巨大的财富；它标志着我们的国家和民族，是有伟大的志气、强大的生命力和美好的希望的。
    但是，那些被铜臭渗透了灵魂的帝国主义者和资产阶级分子，是无法理解这种崇高的共产主义劳动精神的。他们总是带着有色眼镜，一口咬定说他们看到的是什么“奴隶劳动”。而右倾机会主义者们，他们脱离群众，也看不到劳动人民中共产主义思想的成长，他们反对供给制和工资制相结合的制度，反对政治挂帅，主张钞票挂帅。他们怎么可能理解人民中的共产主义劳动精神呢？资产阶级个人主义的哲学就是“人不为己、天诛地灭”嘛！
    马克思主义一向告诉我们，共产主义的劳动是自觉自愿的劳动，是没有定额的劳动，是不指望个人荣誉、不计较个人报酬的劳动。伟大的革命导师马克思，每天要工作十五、六小时，而且经常通宵不断地工作。这种劳动难道是可以计算定额、计较报酬的吗？有着无产阶级革命人生观的人，已经摈弃一切低级趣味，他们活着是为人民而工作而劳动，只有死才能使他们停止工作。多少革命先烈临死之前在敌人的监狱里，仍然学习马克思主义理论，对同狱者进行着革命的教育。他们不求富贵，不图安逸，为人类最庄丽的事业献出了自己最宝贵的生命。
    我们的革命前辈们，在残酷斗争的年代里，为子孙后代献出了他们的一切。吃的是草，挤出来的是奶，这种共产主义的革命精神，今天在他们的第二代中，得到了继承和发扬光大，它在社会主义建设的年代里，就变成为不计报酬、不讲条件、不争荣誉、大公无私的共产主义劳动精神。资产阶级个人主义者同工人阶级集体主义者的人生观是迥然不同的。为了金钱，他们把一切人的高贵的道德品质“沉没在利己主义打算的冰水之中”（“共产党宣言”）；为了金钱，他们惯常地损公利私，损人利己。而工人阶级集体主义者，则把自己能对国家、人民作出尽可能大的贡献，引为自己生活的目的。他们的最大乐趣，不是在个人得到荣誉的时候，不是在个人得到物质奖励的时候，而是在集体得到荣誉、国家增加了财富的时候。革命的工人阶级，使阶级兄弟之间、劳动人民之间，出现了从未有过的最温暖最友爱的关系。
    最近，有一位意大利的著名教授罗托里奥·鲁吉里说：最近几年中国人民取得巨大的进展，如果“没有一种新的生活概念，没有利他主义代替利己主义的社会秩序，这一切是不可能实现的。”他认为中国人民认识到自己“不再属于为他人利益服务的无足轻重的阶级了。他开始感到他是真正掌握自己命运的人。”这句话说得好。虽然我们的“利他主义”的意义和实质比他说的要深远得多。我们已经掌握了自己的命运，在党和毛泽东主席的教导下，有了宏伟的理想——在我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，这就是利他主义、共产主义劳动精神在我国劳动人民中日益普遍和发扬光大的根源。
