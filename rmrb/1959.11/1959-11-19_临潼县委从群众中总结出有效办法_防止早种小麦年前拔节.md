The Lintong County Committee Sums Up Effective Methods from the Masses
Prevent Early-Sown Wheat from Jointing Before the New Year

(Our dispatch) In some areas of Lintong, Shaanxi, wheat is experiencing "winter exuberance" (excessive growth) or showing signs of "winter exuberance." The Lintong County work team, through field observation and symposiums with experienced farmers, quickly found effective ways to prevent "winter exuberance." The Ma'e and Xinfeng communes, which took the first step, have already seen significant results.

According to agricultural science and technology cadres and experienced farmers' joint research, the "winter exuberance" phenomenon in Lintong County wheat this year is mainly due to: first, high temperatures and rapid emergence; second, little autumn rain and delayed autumn rain, resulting in low soil moisture; and third, early sowing. This year's summer and autumn drought led to rain in mid-September, and various localities, in order to take advantage of soil moisture, successively sowed seeds around September 20, seven to ten days earlier than in previous years. It is estimated that more than 20,000 mu of the 70,000 mu of wheat sown earlier in the county have experienced "winter exuberance." If wheat flourishes before winter, it will consume a large amount of the plant's own nutrients, reduce the effective accumulation of dry matter and sugar, weaken cell tissues, and weaken winter hardiness. Failure to pay attention to remedies and prevention will seriously affect wheat yield increase.

What are the ways to remedy and prevent "winter exuberance"? There was initially debate among farmers. Some advocated using the "letting green" method, allowing livestock to graze; others disagreed, considering this a last resort for individual farmers in the past. They believed that the more effective methods are: 1. Harrowing once as soon as possible. The benefit is that it can destroy some of the floating roots, which can have an inhibitory effect. However, it should also be treated differently. For example, waterlogged land that is not short of moisture and is very solid can be lightly harrowed once with a rake. The Sanyu team of Xinfeng Commune achieved good results by using a vegetable rake once. On sunny slopes with insufficient soil moisture and loose soil, it is only necessary to harrow once with a drag. Raking or harrowing should be done in the morning or afternoon, not in the early morning when there is dew. 2. Drill seeding in rows. For fertile and moist dry land, a drill can be used to lightly seed in rows between the rows, followed by light harrowing, which can inhibit the "winter exuberance" of wheat seedlings and also have the effect of soil consolidation and frost protection. 3. Early winter irrigation to increase soil moisture, change the field microclimate, and promote the development of wheat roots. 4. Early topdressing. This provides the wheat with nutrients, increases its winter hardiness, and also cultivates the soil for the wheat seedlings, suppressing the seedlings and reducing photosynthesis, inhibiting the excessive growth of stems and leaves. 5. Early winter hoeing to cut off some of the fine roots.

The Lintong County Committee of the Communist Party of China has analyzed and synthesized these methods found among the masses and finally formulated "Several Opinions on Preventing Wheat Winter Exuberance," which has been issued to various communes, management areas, and production teams. Now, some communes have adopted the above methods and universally launched activities to prevent wheat "winter exuberance."

(Our dispatch) The Heping Production Team of the Guangshui Commune in Yingshan, Hubei, and the Sanlihe Production Team of the Chengguan Commune have adopted various methods to prevent early-sown wheat from jointing before the New Year. Some of the early-sown wheat in these two teams has already grown three true leaves, with a plant height of three to five inches, due to good soil moisture and high temperatures after sowing, showing a tendency to joint before the New Year. After discovering the above situation, the team committees of Heping and Sanlihe Production Teams held symposiums with experienced farmers and conducted research. The methods they adopted can be summarized as follows:

(1) Applying pond mud: From now on, apply a layer of pond mud to the early-sown wheat fields, 300 to 400 dan per mu, or 40 to 50 dan of cattle manure and miscellaneous fertilizer per mu. Applying pond mud can reduce the growth momentum of wheat seedlings and is also beneficial for warmth and overwintering.

(2) Raking the base: After the wheat reaches the three-leaf stage, the secondary roots begin to grow deep. At this time, harrowing the seedlings should be done with a reverse rake to avoid damaging the seedlings. After the peak period of basal leaf growth, a large number of secondary roots have developed. At this time, it is appropriate to use a forward rake to loosen the soil and rake the roots.

(3) Rolling: Use wooden rollers, wooden boards, toothless rakes, etc., for rolling.

(4) After the tillering period, if the growth is still very vigorous and the temperature is high, a portion of the leaf tips should be cut off several times, and the length of each leaf cut should not exceed one-third of the seedling height.

The above measures (1), (2), and (3) should be used in combination to prevent side effects.

### 临潼县委从群众中总结出有效办法  防止早种小麦年前拔节

    临潼县委从群众中总结出有效办法
    防止早种小麦年前拔节
    本报讯　陕西临潼有些地区小麦发生“冬旺”（生长过于繁茂）或者呈现“冬旺”迹象。临潼县的工作组在田间观测和召开老农座谈会，很快找到了防止“冬旺”的好办法。先走一步的马额、新丰等公社已经收到显著效果。
    据农业科学技术干部和老农共同研究，今年临潼县的小麦出现“冬旺”现象，主要原因一是温度高，出苗快；二是秋雨少，秋雨迟，土壤湿度小；三是播种早。今年夏秋干旱，9月中旬落雨，各地为了借墒，在9月20日左右即相继下种，比往年提早七至十天。估计全县种得较早的七万多亩麦子，有两万亩发生了“冬旺”。小麦如果在冬前发旺，就大量消耗了植株本身的营养物质，降低了干物质和糖粉的有效积累，使细胞组织纤弱，削弱了越冬抗寒力，不提早注意补救和防止，将会严重影响小麦产量的提高。
    有什么办法补救和防止“冬旺”呢？开始在农民中间也有争论。一种人主张采用“放青”的办法，让牲口啃吃；另一种人不同意，认为这是过去单干农民迫不得已的办法。他们认为比较有效的作法是：一、赶快耱一次。好处是能破坏一部分浮根，可起抑制作用。但也要分别对待，比如水地正茬麦不缺墒，地又很实在，可用耙轻耙一次。新丰公社三育队用菜耙耙一次效果很好。阳坡地地墒不足，地又很松，就只需用耱耱一次。耙或耱应在上午或下午，不要在早晨有露水时进行。二、耧串。土壤较肥又潮湿的旱地，可用耧在行间浅串一次，再轻耱一次，既可抑制麦苗“冬旺”，又有培土防冻作用。三、提早冬灌，增加土壤水分，改变田间小气候，促使小麦根系发育。四、早施追肥。这样作给小麦增加了养分，增加了越冬抗寒能力，也给麦苗培了土，压了苗，减少了光合作用，抑制了茎、叶旺长。五、提早冬锄，切断一些须根。
    中共临潼县委已把在群众中找到的这些办法，加以分析综合，最后制订了“关于防止小麦冬旺的几点意见”，发给各公社、管理区、生产队。现在，有些公社已采取上述办法，普遍展开了防止小麦“冬旺”活动。
    本报讯　湖北应山广水公社和平生产队和城关公社三里河生产队，采取了多种办法来防止早种小麦年前拔节。这两个队早播的一部分小麦，由于播后墒情好，气温高，麦苗已生出三片真叶、株高三至五寸，有年前拔节的趋势。和平和三里河两生产队发现以上情况后，队委会都召开了老农座谈会，进行了研究，他们采取的办法，概括为如下几种：
    （1）压塘泥：从现在起，在早播麦田里追下一层塘泥，每亩三百至四百担，或每亩下牛栏、杂肥四十至五十担。追压塘泥，可降低麦苗长势，且有利于保温过冬。
    （2）耙蔸：小麦三叶期后，次生根系开始生长深扎，此时耙苗宜用反耙，以免损苗。发蔸盛期以后，次生根已大量发生，此时宜用正耙松土耙根。
    （3）镇压：用木滚、木板、无齿耙等进行镇压。
    （4）分蘖期以后，若长势仍很旺盛，气温又高，应分几次剪去一部分叶尖，每次剪叶的长度不得超过苗高三分之一。
    以上一、二、三项措施应结合采用，以防发生副作用。
