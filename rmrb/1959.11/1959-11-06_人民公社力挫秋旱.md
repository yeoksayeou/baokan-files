    People's Communes Vigorously Combat Autumn Drought
    Guangdong people rely on large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects to fight drought and ensure harvests.
    Hubei's vast number of commune members seize the opportunity after rain to rush ploughing and planting.
    Guangdong's more than 50 million mu of late rice and miscellaneous grains are expected to have a bumper harvest.
    Hubei's autumn ploughing and planting area has reached 90% of the original plan.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th November: After overcoming the once-in-a-century flood, the people of Guangdong Province have also conquered the severe drought that has lasted for more than a month. At present, a bumper harvest of 35 million mu of late rice in the province is a certainty, and nearly 20 million mu of miscellaneous grains and various cash crops are also expected to yield good harvests.
    Since mid-September, when the late rice was in the stage of grouting and grain filling, and sweet potato seedlings were growing and in need of a large amount of water, most parts of Guangdong have not had a drop of rain, except for occasional light rain of less than ten millimeters in some areas. Even the weeds on many hillsides and slopes have dried up. However, out of the province's more than 50 million mu of farmland, only more than 7 million mu have been affected by the drought. Because of the continuous efforts of the drought resistance army, more than 4 million mu of the drought-affected farmland was quickly irrigated, and only more than 500,000 mu of high-lying fields were severely affected.
    The reason why Guangdong Province achieved a good late rice harvest despite the severe drought this year is the victory achieved by the Party and the government in leading the people to develop water conservancy on a large scale. Although water conservancy projects in various places have been releasing water for more than a month, the water source is still not lacking. The province's more than 400,000 large and small reservoirs, mountain ponds, and flat ponds still have more than 50% to 60% of their water storage. Historically, however, Guangdong has often seen small droughts turn into large droughts, and large droughts turn into major disasters. In the autumn drought of 1934, 80% of the fields failed or reduced production, and more than 1 million people starved to death. After liberation, a large number of water conservancy projects were built, increasing and improving the irrigated area by more than 18 million mu, but this still could not eliminate the threat of severe drought. Since the Great Leap Forward and the communization in 1958, Guangdong Province's water conservancy construction has entered a new stage of systematic management, comprehensive development, and comprehensive utilization. In the past two years, more than 800,000 large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects have been built and renovated, increasing and improving the irrigated area by more than 34 million mu; among them, the increased irrigated area is more than 15 million mu, which is more than 7 million mu more than the increase in the eight years after liberation. At present, there are more than 1 million various water conservancy projects in the province, and there are also more than 390 drainage and irrigation projects with more than 10,000 mu. The cultivated land area with irrigation facilities in the province has reached more than 44 million mu, accounting for more than 80% of the total cultivated land area, of which more than 25 million mu have a drought resistance capacity of more than 60 days, and the drought resistance capacity of most of the rest is also more than 30 days. This year, the people of Guangdong have relied on these water conservancy projects to effectively resist and overcome the extraordinary floods in June and the current severe drought. The fact that Guangdong Province's agricultural production is expected to have a bumper harvest has completely shattered the slander of the right-leaning opportunists against the Great Leap Forward, the People's Communes, and the large-scale development of water conservancy.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 5th November: Since entering November, Hubei Province, which has been hit by the largest drought on record, has successively experienced widespread welcome rain. The rainfall generally reached about 40 to 50 millimeters, and the drought has been relieved throughout the province. In recent days, various places have seized the favorable opportunity of the widespread rain, concentrated superior forces, and rushed to plough and plant, greatly accelerating the progress of ploughing and planting. The province's autumn ploughing and planting area has reached 40 million mu, accounting for 90% of the original plan, an increase of 7 million mu compared to last year.
    This year, Hubei Province began to suffer from drought in various places from the end of June. After mid-September, although most areas had one or two batches of rain, the rainfall in many of these areas was still very insufficient, and some areas had even been dry for more than 120 days. Therefore, at the beginning of autumn ploughing and planting, the province was still generally under the threat of severe drought, and had to fight drought while rushing to plough and plant. After mid-September, the drought situation in some areas eased, but the drought in all of the Huanggang Special District, most of the Xiaogan Special District, and a small part of the Jingzhou Special District was still very serious, which brought difficulties to autumn ploughing and planting. However, the heroic people of Hubei, under the strong leadership of Party organizations at all levels, launched a drought-fighting and planting campaign. In the process of fighting drought and rushing to plough and plant, the people's communes in various places exerted great power. Yingji Management District of Zhongyi Commune in Macheng County adopted the method of large-scale troop operations, organized more than 3,000 people to establish specialized teams for water carrying, fertilizer delivery, land preparation, and planting, vigorously carrying out competitions and cooperation. The wheat was planted quickly and well, all of which was strip planting and dense planting, with 300 dan of base fertilizer applied per mu, and the land was leveled smoothly and finely, and the water volume was relatively sufficient. Minsheng Production Team of Hengdian Commune in Huangpi County is a team with a lot of land and little labor. The commune transferred more than 200 people from other production teams to provide support, and the commune's three tractors also came to help rush ploughing. As a result, autumn ploughing and planting were completed according to plan.
    At present, some areas in the province are still continuing to rush ploughing and planting, and some areas are continuing to fight to preserve seedlings, ensure full seedlings, and ensure bumper harvests.

    人民公社力挫秋旱
    广东人民依靠大中小型水利工程抗旱保收
    湖北广大社员抓住雨后时机突击抢耕抢种
    广东五千多万亩晚稻杂粮可望丰收
    湖北秋耕秋种面积已达原计划90％
    新华社广州4日电　广东省人民战胜了百年一遇的水灾之后，又战胜了延续一个多月的严重干旱，目前，全省三千五百多万亩晚稻丰收已成定局，近二千万亩杂粮和各种经济作物也可望丰收。
    广东各地9月中旬以来，当晚稻正在灌浆结粒、番薯幼苗正在成长，需要大量水源的时候，除个别地区有十毫米以下的小雨外，绝大部分地区没下过一滴雨，许多山岗坡地的野草都旱死了，可是全省五千多万亩农田中，累计受旱的只有七百多万亩。这七百万亩受旱农田，也因为抗旱大军日夜奋战，有四百多万亩很快灌上了水，受旱比较严重的只有五十多万亩高亢田。
    广东省今年晚造达到大旱能够得到丰收，是党和政府领导人民大兴水利所获得的胜利成果。今年各地水利工程虽已放水一个多月，水源仍不缺乏。全省四十多万个大小水库、山塘、平塘现在还有五六成以上水量。但广东省在历史上一遇秋旱，往往小旱成大旱，大旱成大灾，1934年一次秋旱就有八成田地失收或减产，饿死了一百多万人。解放后，兴修了大批水利工程，增加和改善了灌溉的面积达一千八百多万亩，但是还不能免除严重干旱的威胁。1958年大跃进、公社化以来，广东省兴修水利建设转入系统治理、全面开发、综合利用的新阶段。这两年中兴建和改建的大、中、小型水利就有八十多万宗，增加和改善了灌溉面积三千四百多万亩；其中增加灌溉面积一千五百多万亩，比解放八年来所增加的还要多七百多万亩。现在，全省已有各种水利工程一百多万宗，万亩以上的排灌工程也有三百九十多宗，全省有灌溉设施的耕地面积已达到四千四百多万亩，占总耕地面积八成以上，其中抗旱能力六十天以上的有二千五百多万亩，其余的抗旱能力绝大部分也在三十天以上。今年，广东人民就是依靠这些水利工程，有效地抗击和战胜了6月间的特大洪水和现在的大干旱。广东省农业生产丰收在望的事实，彻底粉碎了右倾机会主义分子对大跃进、人民公社、大兴水利的诬蔑。
    据新华社武汉5日电　进入11月以来，遭到有记载以来最大旱灾袭击的湖北省各地先后普降喜雨。降雨量一般都达四、五十毫米左右，旱象已在全省范围内解除。连日来，各地抓住普雨的有利时机，集中优势力量，突击抢耕抢种，耕种进度大大加快。全省秋耕秋种面积已达四千万亩，占原订计划的90％，比去年已扩大七百万亩。
    今年湖北省各地从6月底起即开始受旱。到9月中旬以后，大多数地区虽然分批降过一、两场雨，但其中不少地区降雨量仍很不足，有一部分地区甚至连旱一百二十多天。因此，秋耕秋种开始时，全省还普遍处在严重干旱的威胁下，不能不一面抗旱一面抢耕抢种。到9月中旬以后，部分地区旱象趋于缓和，但黄冈专区全部、孝感专区大部和荆州专区的小部分地区旱情仍很严重，这种情况，给秋耕秋种带来了困难。但是英勇的湖北人民，在各级党组织的坚强领导下，开展了抗旱抢耕抢种运动。在抗旱抢耕抢种的过程中，各地人民公社发挥了巨大的威力。麻城县中一公社迎集管理区，采用大兵团作战的方法，组织三千多人分别建立了车水、送肥、整地、播种等专门班子，大搞竞赛、协作，小麦种得又快又好，全部是条播、密植，每亩施底肥三百担，地整得又平又细，而且水量也比较充足。黄陂县横店公社民生生产队是地多劳动力少的队，公社从其他生产队抽调二百多人前来支援，公社的三台拖拉机也来帮助抢耕，结果秋耕秋种都按计划完成。
    目前，全省部分地区还在继续抢耕抢种，部分地区正在为保活、保全苗、保丰收而继续战斗。
