　　The Originator of Pots and Stoves
　　Yang Wei

　　As hundreds of millions of our women are freed from the bonds of cooking pots and stoves, as we no longer worry about the rice in the pot, isn't it interesting and meaningful to look back at the originator of pots and stoves?

　　Our ancestors initially lived a life of drinking blood and eating raw meat. After long and arduous labor, people mastered fire. That fire pile in the cave that never went out was the most primitive stove, although there were no pots at that time.

　　By the Neolithic Age, humans not only made all kinds of exquisite and practical stone weapons and tools, but also invented the technology of firing pottery, learned to build houses, raise livestock, and became familiar with growing crops... With the development of production, the variety of people's food also became richer, which required improved cooking tools and further cooking techniques.

　　In recent years, archaeological workers in our country have discovered many houses from the Stone Age, and almost all of them have stove pits in the middle of the house. In the Yangshao culture site in Banpo, Xi'an, most of the houses have a stove pit in the middle, directly facing the doorway. The stove pit is shaped like a shallow gourd; the same equipment has also been found in the round houses of the Yangshao culture in Baoji. In the square houses of the Yangshao culture in Miaodigou, Shan County, Henan, stove pits are also set up directly facing the doorway, but it is a kind of circular vertical pit, about one meter deep. The location of the stove pit is close to the center of the house, probably because the fire in the stove pit was used for many purposes at that time, not only for cooking, but also for heating and lighting.

　　Cooking and boiling water on this primitive stove pit was not very convenient if using a flat-bottomed pot, as it would need to be supported or hung up. Therefore, in addition to using some basins or jars to boil water and cook, people also used some very special "pots." These pots had three legs, making them stable and convenient to place on the stove pit. There were many kinds of these tripod "pots," one of which was called "Li" (鬲), and its three legs were hollow, like three pointed pockets. The things or drinks to be boiled could be poured into the pockets, and the fire burned under the pockets, so the contents were quickly cooked. Another type was the "Ding" (鼎), with three solid legs under the body, essentially a pot with its own pot stand. The Li was mostly used for cooking rice; the Ding was probably often used for cooking meat and vegetables. There were also some tripod vessels similar to the Li, such as the "Jia" (斝) with pointed feet, and the "He" (盉) and "Gui" (鬶) with spouts and handles. Nowadays, there are steamers for steaming food, and at that time there was a kind of "Zeng" (甑), which was a large basin with many holes in the bottom. It could be placed on top of a Li or Ding to steam rice. Later, the Zeng on top and the Li below were simply combined into one vessel, called "Yan" (甗), which was a special steamer with its own steamer.

　　The various pots used by people thousands of years ago were all pottery made of clay. By the Bronze Age, these things were all changed to bronze.

　　In addition to the fixed stove pits dug in the ground, there was also a kind of light and portable small stove at that time. In the Yangshao cultural relics of Miaodigou, there is a kind of sand-containing red pottery stove. Its stove body is like a large flat-bottomed basin, with a very wide edge at the top, and a trapezoidal fire door is opened in the front. There are also three short feet under the stove, and at the same time, there are three protruding nodules on the inner wall of the stove mouth near the edge, which just support the flat pottery Fu placed on the stove. When the fire is burned in the stove cavity, the things in the Fu will be cooked.

### 锅灶的始祖

    锅灶的始祖
    杨葳
    当我们上亿的妇女们摆脱了锅台灶台的羁绊的时候，当我们不再为锅里的米发愁的时候，让我们来回顾一下锅灶的始祖，也是一件有趣的和有意义的事情吧？
    我们的祖先最早是过着茹毛饮血的生活。经过长期艰苦的劳动，人们掌握了火。那洞中永不熄灭的火堆，也就是最原始的炉灶，当然当时还没有什么锅子。
    到了新石器时代，人类不但会制造各种精美适用的石制武器和工具，还发明了烧造陶器的技术，学会了盖房子，养牲畜，熟习了种庄稼……随着生产的发展，人们的食物的品种也丰富了起来，这样也就要求有完善的炊事工具和进一步的烹调技术。
    近几年来，我国的考古工作者发现了不少座石器时代的房子，屋子中间几乎都设有灶坑。西安半坡的仰韶文化遗址中，多半在房内中间正对着门道的地方有一个灶坑。灶坑成浅浅的瓢形；在宝鸡仰韶文化的圆房子中，也发现过同样的设备。河南陕县庙底沟的仰韶文化方房子中，也正对着门道设置着灶坑，但是它是一种圆形的竖穴，深到一米左右。灶坑的位置都近于房屋的中心，这大概是因为那时候灶坑中的火的用处很多，既要炊煮，又要取暖和照明的缘故。
    在这种原始的灶坑上做饭烧水，如果用平底的锅子就必需支架子或者把它吊起来，不很方便，所以当时的人除了用一些盆子或罐子烧水煮饭外，还用一些很特别的“锅”，锅子下面带着三条腿，放在灶坑上又稳固又方便。这些三足“锅”的种类很多，其中一种叫“鬲”（音历）的，它下面的三只腿是中空的，像三条尖口袋，要煮的东西或饮料可以倒到袋足中，火在袋足的裆下烧，里面的东西很快就被煮熟了。另一种是“鼎”，鼎身下有三条实心的腿，就是一只锅子自己带着锅撑子。鬲多用来煮饭；鼎大概常常用来煮肉做菜了。另外还有些类似鬲的三足器，有尖足的“斝”、有流和有把的“盉”和“鬶”。现在做饭有蒸东西的笼屉，那时候有一种“甑”，是一个底部穿有许多孔的大盆子，把它坐在鬲或鼎上，可以用来蒸饭，后来干脆把上面的甑和下面的鬲合成一件器皿，叫作“甗”，是专门蒸饭用的自带蒸锅的笼屉。
    几千年前人们使用的各种各样的锅，当时都是用土胎烧成的陶器。到了青铜时代，这些东西都改成铜铸的了。
    除了固定的挖在地上的灶坑外，当时也有一种轻便的小炉灶。在庙底沟的仰韶文化遗物中，就有一种夹砂红陶的陶灶。它的灶身像一个大的平底盆子，上口有很宽的边沿，在前面开着一个梯形的火门，灶下还有三条短足，同时在灶口上部接近边沿的内壁上有三个凸瘤，正好承接着放在灶上的扁陶釜，在灶腔里烧上火，釜里的东西就烧熟了。
