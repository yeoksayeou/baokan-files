    Xinhua News Agency, Nairobi, November 18th: News from Nairobi: Twenty thousand African railway workers in Kenya are continuing their strike on the 17th, despite the despicable sabotage methods employed by the capitalists, such as hiring "volunteers." This nationwide railway strike began on the 14th.
    The strike is in support of the struggle of African railway workers in the capital, Nairobi, against racial discrimination. Railway workers in Nairobi had accused a white manager of the railway authorities of racial discrimination against African workers and held a protest strike.
    The African labor union had announced that the workers would not return to work unless the authorities investigated the accusations made by the workers.
    Mboya, the General Secretary of the Kenya Federation of Labour, accused the railway company on the 17th of undermining the strike by buying off some "volunteers." He warned that if the company continued to use "volunteers" to undermine the strike, a general strike would be launched nationwide.

    怯尼亚非洲铁路工人坚持罢工
    新华社18日讯　内罗毕消息：怯尼亚二万名非洲铁路工人不顾资方采取雇用“志愿人员”等卑鄙的破坏手段，在17日坚持他们的罢工斗争。这次全国性的铁路罢工是从14日开始的。
    这次罢工是为了支持首府内罗毕非洲铁路工人反对种族歧视的斗争。内罗毕的铁路工人曾经指责铁路当局的一个白人管理人员对非洲工人的种族歧视的行为，并且举行抗议罢工。
    非洲人工会曾经宣布，假使当局不对工人们提出的控诉进行调查的话，工人们将不复工。
    怯尼亚劳工联合会总书记姆博亚17日指责铁路公司采用收买一些“志愿人员”的办法来破坏罢工的行为。他警告说，如果公司继续利用“志愿人员”来破坏罢工，就将在全国发动总罢工。
