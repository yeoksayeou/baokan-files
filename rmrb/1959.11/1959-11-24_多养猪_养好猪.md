　　Raise More Pigs, Raise Good Pigs
　　Using green fodder to raise pigs is both a "poor man's method" and a scientific method. It is called a "poor man's method" because many wild plants can be used as green fodder. Using more green fodder can reduce the use of refined feed and save grain. Why is it called a scientific method? Because green fodder contains a large amount of nutrients that are lacking in refined feed. Therefore, not only is it advocated to use more green fodder today, but even when refined feed is sufficiently supplied, green fodder is still an indispensable part.
　　How can we obtain a large amount of nutritious green fodder? Xiapu County has set an example for us—establishing a year-round feed base. Establishing a feed base is an economical and practical method with low costs and high returns. Whether in mountainous areas, plains, or by the sea, bases can be established according to local conditions.
　　With sufficient feed, it is also necessary to improve feeding methods to raise large, fat pigs. The Nanshan Team in Hangzhou has developed a set of feed ratio for meat pigs, sows, and piglets, achieving "feeding coarse feed finely, feeding green feed after fermentation, and feeding multiple feeds mixed together." Pigs fed using this method generally weigh more than 100 jin, and some reach more than 200 jin.
　　It is hoped that all regions will do everything possible to develop feed sources in the work of developing pig raising.

    多养猪　养好猪
    用青饲料养猪，是“穷办法”，又是科学的方法。说它是“穷办法”，因为很多野生植物都能作青饲料。多用青饲料，就可以少用精饲料，节约粮食。为什么说是科学的方法呢？因为青饲料中含有大量的营养成分，这些是精饲料中所缺乏的。因此，不仅今天提倡多用青饲料，就是精饲料充分供应的时候，青饲料也还是不可缺少的部分。
    怎样才能取得大量营养丰富的青饲料呢？霞浦县给我们做出了榜样——建立常年饲料基地。建立饲料基地是一个既经济又实惠的办法，成本低，收益大。不论山区、平原或海边，都可以因地制宜建立基地。
    有了充足的饲料，还需要改进饲养方法，才能养出大肥猪。杭州南山队研究出一套关于肉猪、母猪、小猪的饲料搭配比例，做到“粗料细喂，青料发酵喂，多料混喂”。用这个办法喂的猪，一般都有一百多斤，有的达到二百斤以上。
    希望各地在发展养猪工作中，千方百计开辟饲料来源。
