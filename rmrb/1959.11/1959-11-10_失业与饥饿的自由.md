The rulers of capitalist countries always try their best to tout the declining capitalist system, talking glibly about "freedom," "prosperity," "people's capitalism," and so on. When U.S. Vice President Nixon visited the Soviet Union, he shamelessly said that the United States, the world's largest capitalist country, "is closest to the ideal of everyone enjoying prosperity in a classless society." Nixon even said that in the United States, the unemployed also have sufficient guarantees in life. But what is the truth? Let's take a look at the facts. The following are real things that happened not long ago in several major capitalist countries.

The Desolation Behind "Prosperity"

The West German government is good at boasting about the "miracle" of West Germany's economic "prosperity," but behind this "prosperity" lies how much desolation!

According to West German newspapers, 350,000 people wander the streets every day, homeless. Some unemployed people even "commit crimes" deliberately to find shelter in prison. One morning, an unemployed 25-year-old worker hugged a young female worker on a street in Essen, and he was arrested and sent to the local court, which sentenced him to one year in prison. In court, the young man, who had been unemployed for a long time and could not afford to rent a house, said, "I have been longing for a roof over my head for a long time, and this wish has finally come true today!"

Among the unemployed workers, bloody family tragedies often occur. According to the German News Agency, one night, a female doctor named Stelzer Koenig shot her husband to death with a pistol because her husband had been unemployed for several years and had to live on her income. According to the "Frankfurter Rundschau," a 61-year-old carpenter named Albert Schwarz in Kison, West Germany, was poisoned to death by his wife and son. Afterwards, the 49-year-old woman confessed to the court that her husband had been suffering from lung disease for many years and could not work. In order to "eliminate this burden," she decided to poison her husband.

"Slave Black Market"

There are two million unemployed workers in Italy. In order to make a living, they travel around looking for work. Some people take advantage of the plight of unemployed workers to make huge profits. In the immigrant area north of Milan, there is an out-and-out "slave black market." Some headmen control the "job placement agencies" and allocate jobs to unemployed people, on the condition that the job seekers must give one-fifth or one-third of their first three months' salary to the job "introducer" after they get the job. Moreover, the introducer does not conclude labor contracts with them, so these workers cannot get insurance benefits whether they are sick or disabled.

The situation of employed workers is not much better than that of unemployed workers. Mara is an Italian female worker in her thirties. Although she has an ideal lover, she cannot marry. The situation is this: four years ago, she fell in love with a worker named Giulio and finally decided to get married. But a week before the wedding, Mara was suddenly called to the factory director's office. The factory director heard that she was going to get married and specially reminded her about the contract she had signed. Because the contract stated: "This contract shall be invalid from the date of my marriage," that is, she would be unemployed. The factory told her that recruiting girls was more beneficial to the factory, so they "had to" take this measure. Thus, this contract is like a shackle on Mara's neck.

The Poverty in the "Gold Empire"

In the United States, which is known as the "Gold Empire," monopoly capitalists and millionaires live an obscene and shameless life by relying on profits obtained through exploitation, while the working people live a hard life.

An unemployed electrical worker named Joel Beckmann in Pontiac, Michigan, recently killed his only beloved child with a shotgun and then committed suicide. In December 1957, Beckmann was injured on a construction site. He received a small amount of insurance money. But by the time he recovered from his injury, he had no money and could not find a job. In order to get rid of the suffering of starvation for himself and his child, he ended the lives of his only son and himself in despair. This kind of tragic thing is common in this gold empire. In Los Angeles, a worker shot himself because unemployment made it impossible for him to support his wife and four children. He wrote on a note to his wife: "You can now receive $254 in social insurance."

Some unemployed people have to sell their children to make a living. Stealon is an American veteran who has traveled all over the United States from north to south and from west to east for four years, but he has not been able to find a job. Long-term unemployment has completely plunged the Stealon family into desperation. Except for two adults, four children and the clothes they are wearing, there is nothing else to sell. Hunger forced the young Stealon couple to take the last resort: selling their own flesh and blood. The children's mother cried and said: "My heart is torn apart. But this can at least allow the children to find a home and get what they need."

No Rest After Death

In the Bo-Gaszier coal mine in Belgium, a tragic accident occurred in August 1956 due to the coal mine owner's neglect of miners' safety and the use of dilapidated equipment, resulting in the death of workers. At that time, 262 miners were killed, leaving behind 183 widows and 388 orphans. The families of these victims then filed a complaint with the court, demanding compensation from the coal mine owner. After three years of delay, the court finally made a ruling recently. The judgment reads: the defendant is acquitted, and all litigation costs are borne by the families of the victims!

The Dark Valley of Hunger

The Japanese Tsukufeng coal mining area, once known as the "black gem," has now become a "dark valley of hunger." The workers who live here live in dark and dilapidated small wooden houses. A worker said: "If it rains, you have to walk around the cottage all night with empty cans." The workers' children have to go outside every day to catch crayfish to fill their hunger. These children are as happy to see rotten potatoes as they are to get a rich meal. A woman said: "The children ask their parents for food, but the parents have nothing and are also hungry." A worker said sadly: "Workers are miserable!"

### 失业与饥饿的自由

    失业与饥饿的自由
    资本主义国家的统治者们总是千方百计地把日薄西山的资本主义制度吹嘘得天花乱坠，什么“自由”啦，“繁荣”啦，“人民资本主义”啦，等等。美国副总统尼克松曾经在访问苏联的时候大言不惭地说，世界上最大的资本主义国家美国“最接近于在一个没有阶级的社会中大家享受繁荣的理想”。尼克松甚至说，在美国失业者生活上也有足够保障。但究竟真象如何呢？不妨看一下事实。下面是不久之前发生在几个主要资本主义国家中的真实的事情。
    “繁荣”背后的凄凉
    西德政府惯会吹嘘西德经济“繁荣”的“奇迹”，但是在这“繁荣”的背后，隐藏着多少凄凉的景象！
    据西德的报纸报道：有三十五万人每天流浪街头，无家可归。有些失业者甚至故意“犯罪”，以求在监狱得一蔽身之处。一天清晨，一个二十五岁的失业工人在埃森的一条大街上拥抱了一个青年女工，于是他就被人抓住送到当地的法院去，判了他一年徒刑。在法庭上，这个长期因失业而租不起住宅的青年人说，“我长久以来在渴望着头上能有一块屋顶，这个愿望今天终于实现了！”
    在失业工人中，常常发生流血的家庭悲剧。据德意志新闻社报道说：一天夜里，一位名叫施特耳泽·柯尼希的女医生用手枪杀害了她的丈夫，原因是他的丈夫几年来失业而不得不靠她的收入生活。另据“法兰克福评论报”报道：西德歧孙地方一位六十一岁名叫艾伯特·施瓦兹的木匠被他的妻子和儿子用毒药杀害了。事后这位四十九岁的妇人向法院供认：她的丈夫多年来生着肺病，不能工作。为了“消除这个负担”，她下决心毒害了自己的丈夫。
    “奴隶的黑市场”
    意大利失业工人有二百万。为了糊口，他们到处奔波寻找工作。有些人则利用失业工人的困境来谋取暴利。在米兰以北的移民区存在着一个不折不扣的“奴隶黑市场”，一些把头控制了“工作介绍所”，由他们分配失业的人工作，条件是找工作的人得到工作后要把他头三个月工资的五分之一或三分之一给工作“介绍人”。而且，介绍人并不同他们缔结劳动合同，这样一来，这些工人不论生病或者残废都得不到保险费。
    在业工人情况也不比失业工人好多少。玛拉是一位意大利女工，今年三十多岁，她虽然有理想的爱人，但是不能结婚。事情是这样的：四年前她和一个工人朱里奥相爱了，最后决定结婚。但是在婚前一个星期，玛拉突然被叫到厂长室。厂长听说她要出嫁，特地提醒她关于所订合同的问题。因为合同上注明：“自本人出嫁之日起此合同即失效”，也就是失业了。厂方告诉她，招聘姑娘对工厂更有利些，所以“不得不”采取这种措施。于是这份合同就像枷锁一样套在玛拉的脖子上。
    “金元帝国”的贫困生活
    在号称“金元帝国”的美国，垄断资本和百万富翁们依靠剥削得来的利润度着荒淫无耻的生活，劳动人民却在度着艰苦的岁月。
    美国密执安州庞蒂埃克的一个失业电气工人乔耳·贝克曼不久前用鸟枪杀死了他唯一心爱的孩子后自杀了。1957年12月贝克曼在一个建筑工地上受了伤。他得到一小笔保险金。但等他治好伤，他已经没有钱了，而且再也找不到工作。为了摆脱他和他的孩子忍饥挨饿的苦难，在绝望中他结束了他的独生子和自己的生命。这种惨痛的事情，在这金元帝国里是屡见不鲜的。在洛杉矶有一个工人，因为失业使他无法养活他的妻子和四个儿女开枪自杀了。在他留给妻子的一张便条上写道：“你现在可以领到二百五十四美元的社会保险了。”
    有些失业者不得不靠出卖儿女来苟延性命。斯迪隆是美国一个退伍军人，四年来他从北到南，从西到东跑遍了整个美国，可是一直找不到工作。长期的失业，使得斯迪隆一家完全陷于绝境，除了两个大人、四个小孩和他们身上穿的衣服外，再也没有什么可卖的了。饥饿迫使年青的斯迪隆夫妇走最后一着：出卖自己的亲骨肉。孩子的妈妈哭着说：“我的心全给撕碎了。可是这样毕竟可以使孩子们找到一个家和得到他们需要的东西。”
    死后不得安息
    在比利时的波·加兹尔煤矿，1956年8月由于煤矿主忽视矿工安全，使用破旧设备曾经发生压死人的惨祸。当时有二百六十二名矿工牺牲了，他们留下了一百八十三个寡妇和三百八十八个孤儿。这些死难者的家属当时就向法庭提出控告，要求煤矿主赔偿损失。拖了三年，最近法庭才作了判决。判决书写道：被告无罪释放，全部诉讼费用由遇难工人家属负担！
    黑暗的饥饿山谷
    曾经被称为“黑宝石”的日本筑丰煤矿区，现在已经变成为“黑暗的饥饿山谷”了。在这里生活的工人们住在黑暗破乱的小木板房里。一位工人说：“如果下雨的话，整个晚上要拿着空罐子在小屋里走来走去”。工人们的孩子们不得不每天到外面去抓螯虾来充饥。这些孩子们看到了腐烂的土豆就像得到了丰盛的饭食一样高兴。一位妇女说：“孩子们向父母亲要吃的，可是父母亲们什么也没有，自己也在饿着肚子”。有一个工人悲痛地说：“工人就是惨呵！”
