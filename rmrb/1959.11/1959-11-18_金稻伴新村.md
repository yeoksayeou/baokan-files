    Golden Rice Accompanies New Village
    By Our Correspondent Dù Dǎozhèng
    In early November, the Dongjiang and Zengjiang rivers flowing through Zengcheng County were tranquil, clear, and as green as ribbons. On both banks of the river, vast fields of rice were ripe, crowded together, smiling, and vying to nod to the people, waiting for harvest. In the shade of the trees, newly built buildings stood in rows. The gold of the rice and the white of the buildings shone in contrast to each other.
    In June, Zengcheng County, a severely affected area that suffered from a once-in-a-century flood disaster that turned early rice into mud and destroyed villages into ruins, realized the heroic oath of Comrade Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, after four months: "Nature has taken away our wealth, and we must take it back from nature." It has not only restored its temporarily lost youth, but has become more beautiful and vibrant than before the disaster. However, do you know how much effort the Party and the people have put into this, how many tenacious struggles have been waged, and how many tortuous roads have been traversed!
    Late Rice Abundance is Hard-Won
    I, as a reporter, visited the severely affected areas of Zengcheng for the second time around August 10th. At that time, the late rice in the severely affected areas was in full bloom, erasing the traces of the flood disaster from the fields. Farmers estimated that they were confident of harvesting 500 jin per mu. However, just as a bumper harvest was in sight and people were excited and preparing to take advantage of the relatively idle time before the autumn harvest to free up their hands to rebuild their homes and eliminate the traces of the flood disaster in the villages, they were repeatedly harmed by severe waterlogging. During the severe flood disaster in Zengcheng County in June, the rainfall was only 672 millimeters. However, in August, the rainfall reached 362 millimeters; and in September, it still reached 213 millimeters. Moreover, the rainfall was mainly concentrated in late August and early September. The floodwaters from the rivers were blocked by the newly repaired dikes, but the rice fields within the dikes were repeatedly waterlogged. Of the 550,000 mu of late rice transplanted in the severely flooded areas of Zengcheng County, 120,000 mu were submerged by the third instance of waterlogging.
    It was on the morning of September 1st that I took advantage of a break in the rain and rushed from Zengcheng to the Party Committee office of Shitan Commune. As soon as I arrived, a torrential rain continued to fall, beating the good late rice into a mess, and thousands upon thousands of mu were submerged in the torrential floodwaters. Heaven was deliberately causing trouble, but the people would not give in. Zhong Yumin, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, returned from the Suopu breach construction site in the rain, and before he could change his clothes, he ran to inquire about the waterlogging situation. The data clerk handed him a report stating that "the area of late rice waterlogging has increased to 30,000 mu." After reading it, he immediately notified the secretaries of the major brigade branches to come to a meeting. At the meeting, except for a few comrades, everyone was in high spirits. Comrade Zhong Yumin concluded with a loud voice, saying: Shitan Commune has planted 95,000 mu of late rice, and now 30,000 mu have been flooded. If 30,000 mu cannot be rescued, the vitality of production cannot be restored, and the plan to rebuild homes will also be aborted. He also said: The people have already overcome the first waterlogging (August 13th, 12,000 mu of rice flooded, 5,000 mu drowned), the second waterlogging (August 26th, 15,000 mu of rice flooded, 8,000 mu drowned), and now the masses are in high spirits and have experience in drainage, and they are fully capable of overcoming the third waterlogging. After the meeting, a battle to "get grain from the water" unfolded.
    The people drained the floodwaters day and night, draining one mu and replanting one mu. All the water pumps and waterwheels were put into operation, and the masses put forward the slogan of "people stop but machines don't." In areas such as Gangbei, Shatian, and Shangxiawei, the masses took out their water buckets, scoops, and dippers, and even washbasins from their homes to drain water. On the night of September 3rd, I saw more than 300 people from the Mache Brigade taking shifts to operate more than 100 waterwheels, eating by the waterwheels and sleeping by the waterwheels. When one shift was tired, another shift that had been sleeping nearby rubbed their eyes and took over. In the Xiangdongdong rice field, 120 mu were waterlogged, with the water nearly two meters deep. I personally saw more than 100 waterwheels draining for an hour, and the water level only dropped by one centimeter. But the optimistic people never feared and never lost heart, fighting day and night. By around September 20th, 100,000 mu of the 120,000 mu of waterlogged late rice in the severely flooded areas of Zengcheng County had been rescued.
    After the floodwaters were drained, drought was encountered. Not a drop of rain fell for forty days. Because of the relatively good water conservancy construction, no field was dried to death after a tenacious struggle against drought. Now, the late rice in the severely affected areas of Zengcheng, except for 20,000 mu of waterlogged rice that failed to produce a harvest, and several tens of thousands of mu of rice that were replanted for the third time that have not yet fully matured, more than 400,000 mu are already yellow and ripe, and most have long ears, many grains, and full grains.
    Ten Thousand Buildings Rise from the Ground
    Waterlogging and drought forced the Party and the people to devote all their efforts to deal with them, which brought difficulties to the reconstruction of homes. Even so, the appearance of all the villages in the severely affected areas of Zengcheng County has undergone earth-shaking changes, not only compared to after the disaster, but even compared to before the disaster. After the disaster, 17,200 houses in the severely affected areas were destroyed (houses for raising poultry and livestock or storing firewood were not included), and nearly half of the villages became ruins. Before the flood disaster, most of the farmers in this area lived in mud-brick, tile-roofed, not spacious, and bright bungalows. There were not many brick houses, and even fewer buildings. But now, with the full assistance of the government, 3,000 new buildings have been completed and delivered for use (one "jian" here actually refers to two large rooms upstairs and downstairs. Same below), and 1,800 are under construction. Most of them are new-style two-story buildings, all with brick and wood structures, white walls and black tiles, and colored windows. Most are groups of five households or six or seven households, and each household can generally be divided into two large rooms upstairs and downstairs. The large room upstairs is used as a warehouse or can also be used for living; the large room downstairs is divided, with the front half being the living room and the back half being the bedroom. Some also have a small courtyard behind the building, with a small kitchen, bathroom, pigsty, and chicken coop. Most of the 5,000 houses that have been repaired (referring to houses that collapsed by more than half and were rebuilt) are of good quality, and some have also enlarged the windows and renovated and painted them. The two secretaries of the Zengcheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China told reporters that a total of 9,800 houses have been newly completed, are under construction, and have been repaired in the severely affected areas of the county; after the autumn harvest, another 5,000 will be newly built and 2,000 will be repaired, and by the Spring Festival, all 17,200 houses destroyed by the flood will be restored.
    On November 1st, I visited Hezhou Village near Zengcheng County for the third time. As soon as I entered the village, I had a strong feeling of being unrecognizable. When I visited here on July 1st, all the houses in this village of 100 households, except for one ancestral hall and one public canteen, were lying in ruins of mud and bricks. The disaster victims lived in temporary, low-lying tile sheds or tents lent by the garrison troops, and some were squeezed into ancestral halls and public canteens. When I visited here for the second time on August 6th, the ruins had been cleared, revealing the streets, and some of the disaster victims had moved into temporary residences with taller wooden walls and tile roofs. Five houses had been built in the east end of the village, but the traces of the disaster were still visible and the appearance was still very unsightly. Compared with the situation in Hezhou Village, the living conditions were considered to be inferior to those of the ten severely affected villages I visited this time. In villages such as Gangbei, Shisha, Ma'angang, and Shitan, most of the newly built buildings have been painted and varnished and have welcomed most of the disaster victims. Every household has its houses painted snow-white, and red couplets are pasted at the door. Upon entering the door, there is first the living room, with New Year pictures pasted on the front wall, and a portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in the center (some hang two). Around the portrait, there are often paper decorations such as peaches of longevity and wreaths that the hostess personally cut. The room has tables and chairs, and many households also have newly purchased thermos bottles on the table. Inside the living room is the bedroom, with a cloth curtain at the bedroom door, and most of the beds have mosquito nets.
    The people in the severely affected areas told reporters that they hoped that the speed of building houses would be faster. The half of the disaster victims who are temporarily living in public buildings and temporary housing that fortunately did not collapse in the flood have a particularly urgent request. Shitan and Zengjiang communes have taken measures to complete the civil housing construction plan ahead of schedule.
    "Thirteen Years of Comparison"
    On the evening of November 3rd, the commune members of Mache Village performed the Cantonese opera "Thirteen Years of Comparison" that they created themselves. The script writes about a person named Liu Ziqiang in this village. After the big flood in 1945, his father was beaten to death by the landlord for forcing rent, and his mother endured unspeakable pain and sold her younger sister for one hundred jin of grain. However, the famine and the landlord's evil deeds continued, and it seemed that the mother and son were about to starve to death. The mother cried and begged Ziqiang to go to Hong Kong to work and escape for his life. After this year's flood disaster, Liu Ziqiang was deceived by propaganda and hurriedly returned home to visit, and his anxiety and doubts disappeared immediately. This is a true story.
    In July 1945, there was a major flood in the Dongjiang area, which only drowned part of the early rice, and the houses did not collapse. But many farmers in this area died, fled, sold their children, and their families were destroyed. After the disaster, 26 farmers in Mache Village starved to death in the village, and 157 farmers from other villages starved to death. More than 100 households in Tianxia Village, except for six households, fled to escape the famine. More than 100 households in Shisha Village sold their children, and a boy was only worth 800 jin of grain, and girls were not worth any money. People are unwilling to mention these painful past events, but seeing the tragic experience of Liu Ziqiang's family in the "Thirteen Years of Comparison" play, painful memories will flood back. Most of the farmers around my seat were sobbing, and a middle-aged woman named Wu Ahang in the front left had experienced an even more miserable encounter than Liu Ziqiang. She was watching this play for the third time, but she still couldn't control her emotions, with tears in her eyes, stroking her niece Liu Amin in her arms, and repeatedly said, "You are so happy!"
    Recalling the years of thirteen years ago, facing the late rice like golden grains that are about to be obtained, and thinking about living in or immediately moving into two-story buildings, please think about what kind of emotions will be stirred up in the minds of farmers who suffered a devastating flood disaster four months ago! How much spark and power will be burst out!
    There is a folk saying that you can't see the plains without seeing the high mountains. Without knowing the painful past, you don't know the happiness of today; you don't know why every family wants to put up a portrait of Chairman Mao, why they want to decorate the portrait of Chairman Mao with wreaths; why they wear new clothes and set off firecrackers when they move into a new home; why every call of our Party has such great magic power for the people, able to attract people to forget to eat and sleep, and even sacrifice their lives to exchange for victory!

    金稻伴新村
    本报记者　杜导正
    11月初，流经增城县境的东江和增江，宁静、清彻、碧绿如带。江两岸，万顷水稻熟了，拥挤着，微笑着，争向人们频频点头，等候收获。绿荫处，新建成的楼房，成排成行。稻子的金色和楼房的白色，交相辉映。
    6月份，遭受了百年一遇的洪水灾害，把早稻浸成烂泥，将村庄毁成废墟的增城县重灾区，经过四个月就实现了中共广东省委第一书记陶铸同志“大自然夺走了我们的财富，我们一定要从大自然手中夺取回来”的豪迈誓言。它不只恢复了暂时失去的青春，而且比灾前变得更美、更有生气。可是，你知道党和人民为此费了多少心血，进行过多少顽强的斗争，经历了多么曲折的道路！
    晚稻丰产得来不易
    记者是8月10日前后第二次访问增城重灾区的。重灾区的晚稻，那时已是满园春色，把田野上水灾遗留下来的痕迹消灭干净。农民估计每亩五百斤有把握。可是正当丰收在望，人们兴高彩烈，准备利用秋收前夕农活较闲的空儿，腾出手来重建家园，消灭村庄里的水灾痕迹时，却接二连三地受到严重内涝的为害。增城县重水灾地区，6月份大水灾时，也不过降雨六百七十二毫米。可是8月份，降雨量竟达到三百六十二毫米；9月份仍达二百一十三毫米。而且雨量主要集中在8月底9月初。江河洪水被刚刚修复的堤围挡回去了，可是堤围内稻田一再受涝。增城县重水灾区晚稻插秧五十五万亩，第三次内涝淹没禾顶的达十二万亩。
    那是9月1日早晨，我瞅停雨的空隙，从增城赶到石滩公社党委办公室。刚刚到，没头没脑的大雨继续盖下来，大好的晚稻被打得七零八落，成千成万亩淹没在滔滔涝水里。苍天存心捣乱，人们决不让步。公社党委第一书记钟煜民，从夙埔缺口工地冒雨回来，不及换衣服，就跑来讯问涝情。资料员交给他一张“晚稻内涝面积增到三万亩”的表报。他看过以后，立刻通知各大队支部书记前来开会。会上除个别同志外，个个情绪激昂。钟煜民同志结论时声音宏亮，他说：石滩公社种晚稻九万五千亩，现在淹了三万亩。三万亩抢救不出，生产上的元气就不能恢复，重建家园的计划也要流产。他还说：人民已经战胜了第一次内涝（8月13日，淹稻一万二千亩，浸死五千亩）、第二次内涝（8月26日，淹稻一万五千亩，浸死八千亩），现在群众情绪高，排涝有经验，完全能够战胜第三次内涝。会后，一场“向水要粮”的战斗展开了。
    人民日夜排除涝水，排干一亩，补插一亩。所有的抽水机、水车都开动了，群众提出了“人停车不停”的口号。岗贝、沙田、上下围等地，群众把家里的水桶、水兜、水瓢，甚至洗脸盆拿来排水。9月3日夜，我看到麻车大队三百多人轮班使着一百多部水车，吃在水车旁，睡在水车旁，一班人累了，睡在一旁的另一班人揉揉眼睛接上来。向东洞这片稻田内涝一百二十亩，水深近两米。我亲眼看见一百多部水车排了一小时，涝水水位才降低一厘米。但是乐观的人们从不畏惧，从不灰心，日夜奋战。增城县重水灾地区的十二万亩内涝晚稻，到9月20日前后救出了十万亩。
    排除了涝水，又遇到了干旱。四十天内一滴雨没有落，因为水利建设较好，经过顽强地抗旱斗争，没有旱死一亩田。现在增城重灾区的晚稻，除两万亩内涝失收，几万亩第三次补插的还没有完全成熟外，四十多万亩已经黄熟了，大部分穗长、粒多、粒实。
    万所楼房平地起
    内涝和干旱，迫使党和人民不得不倾全力去对付，它给重建家园带来困难。就是这样，现在增城县重灾区所有村庄的模样，不仅比灾后，就是比灾前也发生了翻天复地的变化。灾后，重灾区毁坏的房屋一万七千二百间（喂家禽家畜或放柴草的房屋未计入），有少一半的村庄成为废墟。水灾前，这一带农民，绝大部分是住在坭砖、瓦顶、不够宽敞、明亮的平房里，砖房不多，楼房更少。可是现在在政府全力援助下，新建竣工交付使用的三千间（此处的一间实为楼上楼下两大间。下同），开始新建的一千八百间，绝大部分是新式的二层楼房，全部砖木结构，白墙黑瓦，彩色窗户，多为五户一组或六、七户一组的楼房，每户一般可分得楼上楼下两大间。楼上一大间当仓库，也可以住人；楼下一大间截开，前半截是客厅，后半截做卧室。有的在楼后还附有一个小院子，有小厨房、洗澡间、猪圈和鸡栏。修建好的（指倒塌一半以上又重建的住房）五千间住房，大部分质量良好，小部分还扩大了窗户，整修粉刷一新。中共增城县委两位书记告诉记者，全县重灾区，新建竣工、正在新建、修建好的房屋共九千八百间；秋收后再新建五千间、修建二千间，到春节时，被洪水毁坏的一万七千二百间，就一间不少的恢复了。
    11月1日，我第三次到增城县城附近的鹤洲村去访问。一进村，便有面目全非的强烈感觉。7月1日我访问这里时，这个百户村庄，除一间祠堂、一所公共食堂以外，所有房屋都睡倒在烂坭烂砖里。灾民住在临时搭盖的矮小瓦棚或驻军借给的帐棚里，有的挤在祠堂、公共食堂里。8月6日我第二次访问这里，废墟清理了，露出了街道，一部分灾民搬进了较高大些的木墙、瓦顶的临时住所，村东头修建了五间住房，但是灾痕斑斑，面目仍是十分难看。这回来，村中间正东正西辟了一条十米宽的大街，街南五座二层楼房正在敷瓦，街北一座二层楼房盖好了，已搬进了六户灾民。像鹤洲村庄的情形，和我这次访问的十个重灾村庄比，居住条件算是下等的。岗贝、石厦、马安岗、石滩等村庄，绝大部分新建楼房已经粉刷油漆完毕，迎接进了大部分的灾民。家家户户房子刷得雪白，门口贴着红色对联，进门去，先是客厅，正壁贴着年画，中央挂着毛主席像（有的挂两张），像的四围往往贴着或挂着女主人亲手剪的寿桃、花环等纸饰。室内有桌有椅，许多户桌上还有新置的暖壶。客厅里边是卧房，卧房门口有布帘，床上大多有蚊帐。
    重灾区人民告诉记者，他们希望建房的速度更快些。那少一半暂时还住在洪水中侥幸未塌的公共建筑和临时住房中的灾民，要求尤为迫切。石滩、增江两个公社，已采取措施，提前完成民房建筑计划。
    “十三年对比”
    11月3日晚上，麻车村公社社员演出他们自己创作的粤剧“十三年对比”。剧本写本村一个叫刘自强的人，1945年大水灾后，父亲被地主逼租打死了，母亲忍受着无以铭状的痛苦，以一百斤谷的代价卖掉妹妹。但是，灾荒和地主的恶行继续着，眼看母子也要饿死了。母亲哭着请求自强出走香港打工逃命。今年水灾后，刘自强受了欺骗宣传，仓忙回家探望，不安和疑虑顿时消失。这是一个真实的故事。
    1945年7月东江一带大水，只淹死了部分早稻，房子没有倒塌。但是这一带农民死得死，逃得逃，卖儿卖女，家破人亡的不知道多少。麻车村灾后饿死本村农民二十六人，饿死外村农民一百五十七人。田厦村一百多户，除六户外，都逃荒去了。石厦村卖儿女的有一百多户，卖到一个男孩子只值八百斤谷，女孩子不要钱。人们不愿意重提这些痛苦的往事，但是触景生情，看到“十三年对比”剧中刘自强一家悲惨的遭遇时，痛苦的回忆就会泛滥起来。我座位周围的农民大都在唏嘘哭泣，左前方一位叫吴阿行的中年妇女，经历了比刘自强还凄惨的遭遇。她是第三次看这个剧了，但是仍然控制不住自己的感情，含着眼泪，抚摸着怀中的侄女刘阿明，连连说“你们多幸福啊！”
    回忆起十三年前的岁月，面对着就要到手的金粒一样的晚稻，想到住在或立刻就要住的二层楼房，请想想，这会在四个月前遭受到毁灭性洪水灾害的农民思想中，激起什么样的感情！爆发出多大的火花和力量！
    民间有一句谚语说，不见高山不显平地。不知道痛苦的过去，就不知道今天的幸福；就不知道农民为什么每家要贴毛主席像，为什么要在毛主席像周围饰以花环；为什么迁入新居时，穿新衣、放鞭炮；为什么我们党的每一个号召，对人民群众具有那么大魔力，能够吸引人们废寝忘食，甚至牺牲自己的生命去换取胜利！
