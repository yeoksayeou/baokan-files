Northern and Medium-Sized Cities Universally Store Autumn Vegetables
The Capital Organizes Urban-Rural Cooperation to Mobilize Every Household to Store Vegetables

(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) This year, northern China's major and medium-sized cities have universally achieved a bumper harvest of autumn vegetables. Currently, all localities are extensively mobilizing the masses to seize the opportunity to do a good job in storing and processing autumn vegetables.

This year, northern major and medium-sized cities have implemented the principle of "primarily relying on self-reliance, striving for external assistance as a supplement" in developing non-staple food production and have universally established vegetable production bases in suburban areas. The output of autumn vegetables in various places has increased by more than double compared to last year, generally guaranteeing the vegetable supply needed by local people for the next four to five months. The commercial vegetables in Harbin can supply the entire city for eight months, changing the historical situation of "shipping southern vegetables to the north" and achieving self-sufficiency.

Because the output of autumn vegetables is high this year and the harvest period is concentrated, the number of vegetables that need to be stored and processed greatly exceeds that of previous years. All localities have universally established autumn vegetable transfer and storage headquarters, launching a mass movement for autumn vegetable storage and processing. In many areas, in addition to people's communes and commercial departments engaged in vegetable business making every effort to expand storage, they also extensively mobilize organizations, enterprises, schools, and residents to store and process autumn vegetables. Commercial departments in cities such as Tianjin, Harbin, and Shenyang have organized collective mess halls in factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and schools to link up with communes to do a good job in vegetable storage. Collective consumption units in Baoji City put forward the slogan "Everyone eats vegetables, everyone takes action," and they have been using holidays to organize voluntary labor to rush to build pickling ponds. Residents of cities such as Lushun-Dalian and Harbin have launched a vegetable storage competition movement of "Every household stores a cellar of fresh vegetables, pickles a vat of sauerkraut, pickles a jar of salted vegetables, and dries a basket of dried vegetables."

Many people's communes are actively creating new methods for storing vegetables. The Huidui People's Commune in Hexi District, Tianjin City, used reeds instead of wood to build wood-free dome cellars, roofless cellars, as well as sunny slope vegetable cellars and ditch burial, a total of seven kinds of simple vegetable cellars, which were immediately promoted throughout the city. Hexi District alone saved more than 2,700 cubic meters of wood. In order to help collective mess halls master storage techniques, the agricultural and commercial departments in various places have printed many small booklets on vegetable storage methods and have held vegetable storage training classes or various meetings.

(Our newspaper dispatch) The autumn vegetable storage season has arrived, and Beijing has launched a mass movement to "coordinate urban and rural areas, combining public and private efforts, everyone taking action, and every household storing vegetables."

This year, more than 500,000 mu of autumn vegetables sown in Beijing's suburbs are growing well, and a bumper harvest is a foregone conclusion. The estimated net vegetable output will reach 1 billion jin, an increase of more than double compared to last year. In order to store the harvested autumn vegetables well for consumption this winter and next spring, in addition to organizing state-owned commercial departments to store autumn vegetables, Beijing has vigorously mobilized people's communes, organizations, groups, factories, schools, the catering industry, and residents to store autumn vegetables. Now, both the city and districts have established vegetable storage headquarters, and the district party secretaries and district heads are personally taking charge of leading this work in all districts. In recent days, in addition to convening meetings of organizations, groups, and street residents to carry out propaganda and mobilization, arrangements have also been made for various preparatory work for storing vegetables. After a series of preparations, the vegetable storage work is progressing rapidly. Of the more than 20,000 cubic meters of cellar wood needed for building cellars throughout the city, 18,000 cubic meters have now been transported to various cellar construction sites. Commercial departments have now built more than 1,000 vegetable cellars. More than 15,000 cellar pits have been dug in the suburbs. The vast number of residents are also very active in storing vegetables this time. They realize that this is the Party's concern for the people's lives and expressed that they want to store more vegetables and store them well. The residents of Hepingli Street Office in Dongcheng District have already arranged the work of storing autumn vegetables, and each household can store more than 200 jin of vegetables.

    北方大中城市普遍贮存秋菜
    首都组织城乡协作发动户户存菜
    据新华社讯　我国北方各大中城市今年秋菜获得普遍丰收。目前，各地正在广泛发动群众，抓紧时机作好秋菜的贮存和加工工作。
    北方各大中城市，今年贯彻了“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的发展副食品生产的方针，普遍在郊区建立了蔬菜生产基地。各地秋菜的产量比去年增加一倍以上，一般都能保证今后四、五个月内当地人民所需的蔬菜供应量。哈尔滨市的商品菜可供全市人民吃八个月。改变了历史上“南菜北运”的局面，达到自给。
    由于今年秋菜产量高，收获期集中，需要储存和加工的蔬菜数量大大超过往年，各地普遍设立了秋菜调运贮存指挥部，大搞秋菜贮藏和加工的群众运动，许多地区除人民公社和经营蔬菜的商业部门尽力扩大贮存外，还广泛发动机关、企业、学校和居民贮存和加工秋菜。天津、哈尔滨、沈阳等城市的商业部门，组织厂矿、企业、机关、学校等集体伙食单位和公社挂钩，做好蔬菜贮存工作。宝鸡市的集体消费单位提出“人人吃菜，人人动手”的口号，纷纷利用假日组织义务劳动赶修腌菜池。旅大、哈尔滨等城市居民开展了“家家户户贮一窖鲜菜、渍一缸酸菜、腌一瓮咸菜、晒一筐干菜”的贮菜竞赛运动。
    许多人民公社积极创造新方法贮存蔬菜。天津市河西区灰堆人民公社利用芦苇代替木料建成无木料的圆顶菜窖、无顶菜窖以及阳畦囤菜、挖沟埋藏等七种简易菜窖，立即在全市推广，仅河西区就节省了两千七百多立方米木材。各地农业、商业部门为了帮助集体伙食单位掌握贮存技术，已印发了许多有关菜蔬贮存方法的小册子，并举办蔬菜贮藏训练班或召开各种会议。
    本报讯　秋菜贮存季节已到，北京市展开了一个“城乡协作、公私并举、人人动手、户户存菜”的贮存蔬菜的群众运动。
    北京市今年郊区播种的五十多万亩秋菜，生长良好，丰收已成定局，预计净菜产量达十亿斤，将比去年增产一倍多。为了把丰收的秋菜贮存好，以备今冬明春吃菜，北京市除了组织国营商业部门贮存秋菜以外，大力发动了人民公社、机关团体、工厂学校、饮食业和居民贮存秋菜。现在市、区都成立了蔬菜贮存指挥部，各区都是区委书记、区长亲自挂帅领导这一工作。连日来，除召开机关团体和街道居民会议，进行了宣传动员外，对贮存蔬菜的各项准备工作也作了安排。经过一系列的筹备，蔬菜贮存工作进度很快。全市建窖需要的二万多立方米窖木，现已有一万八千立方米运到各建窖地点。商业部门现已建好一千多个菜窖。郊区已挖好窖坑一万五千多个，广大居民对这次贮存蔬菜也很积极。他们认识到这是党对人民生活的关怀，表示要多存菜，把菜存好。东城区和平里街道办事处的居民贮存秋菜工作都已安排好了，每户可存菜二百多斤。
