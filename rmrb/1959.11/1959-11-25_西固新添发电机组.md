    New Generator Unit Added to Xigu
    The second-phase expansion project of the Lanzhou Xigu Thermal Power Plant is under construction, and one of its generator units was officially put into production on November 12. This generator unit is one of the key projects of the second-phase expansion of the Xigu Thermal Power Plant. The employees of the Third Engineering Department of the Gansu Provincial Electric Power Industry Bureau Construction Company, who were responsible for the installation of this unit, closely cooperated with the civil construction departments and adopted advanced construction methods of parallel and cross operations, which greatly shortened the installation period.
