Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 9th: Czechoslovakia has seen a large increase in crop yield per unit area this year. The national average wheat yield per hectare has increased by more than 400 kilograms compared to last year, and barley has increased by an average of more than 230 kilograms per hectare.

Many agricultural production cooperatives have actively responded to the call of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party to increase crop yield per unit area and strive for a fundamental improvement in agricultural production. They have adopted a series of yield-increasing measures, such as selecting superior seeds, applying more fertilizer, diligently weeding, building water conservancy projects, and deep plowing. As a result, the crop yield per unit area of these cooperatives this year has more than doubled compared to last year. The twelve hectares of wheat at the Libochovice Agricultural Experiment Station yielded an average of 5,500 kilograms per hectare, and the eight hectares of cultivated land at the Knezevces Agricultural Cooperative yielded an average of 5,400 kilograms. The average wheat yield in the entire Sered County of Slovakia is 3,000 kilograms per hectare, which has exceeded the wheat yield target (2,700 kilograms per hectare) for the final year (1965) of Czechoslovakia's Third Five-Year Plan.

The "Youth" Agricultural Cooperative in Slovakia harvested 130,000 kilograms of green corn feed from a one-hectare high-yield corn experimental field this year, which is twice the national average yield. This cooperative used undeniable facts to dispel the superstition that corn is not suitable for planting in Czechoslovakia.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: According to a report from the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the growth of late rice crops in Vietnam this year is even better than last year, which was the best year for late rice crops. The yield of early-maturing rice harvested recently in many places is generally 20% to 50% higher than last year.

The Vietnamese Prime Minister's Office recently convened a meeting of representatives from the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry, Water Conservancy, and some central agencies to discuss the rush harvesting of late rice crops and further promote winter-spring production.

The meeting decided to do a good job in organizing the late rice harvest, striving for fast and good harvests, and preventing all waste.

The meeting pointed out that all localities must formulate specific harvesting plans, prepare sufficient manpower, tools, and transportation equipment, and strive for timely harvesting. In areas where harvesting has already taken place, the land should be plowed immediately. While leading the harvest, guidance should be given to all localities to select seeds and prepare sufficient good seeds for the next crop.

The meeting also pointed out that some areas in the provinces are currently suffering from drought. Drought resistance remains one of the main tasks at present and must be further strengthened.

    捷谷物单位面积产量显著提高
    越南今年晚稻生长情况良好
    新华社布拉格9日电　捷克斯洛伐克农作物单位面积产量今年有很大提高。全国小麦每公顷的平均产量比去年增加了四百公斤以上，大麦每公顷平均增产两百三十多公斤。
    许多农业生产合作社今年积极响应了捷共中央关于提高农作物单位面积产量、争取农业生产根本好转的号召，采取了精选种子、多施肥、勤锄草、兴修水利和深耕等一系列增产措施。这使得这些合作社今年农作物的单位面积产量比去年增加了一倍以上。利博赫茨维切农业试验站的十二公顷小麦平均每公顷产量达到五千五百公斤，克内泽芙茨农业合作社的八公顷耕地的平均产量是五千四百公斤。斯洛伐克塞雷德县全县小麦的平均产量是每公顷三千公斤，已超过捷克斯洛伐克第三个五年计划最后一年（1965年）的小麦产量指标（每公顷二千七百公斤）。
    斯洛伐克的“青年”农业合作社今年试种的一公顷玉蜀黍高产试验田，收获了十三万公斤玉蜀黍青饲料，比全国平均产量增加两倍。这个合作社用无可辩驳的事实破除了在捷克斯洛伐克不适合栽种玉蜀黍的迷信。
    据新华社河内电　据越南农林部报告，越南今年晚稻生长情况比晚稻年成最好的去年还要好。最近许多地方收割的早熟稻的产量一般比去年增加20％到50％。
    越南总理府最近召集农林、水利两部和部分中央机关的代表举行会议，讨论抢收晚稻和进一步推动冬春季生产的问题。
    会议决定做好晚稻收割的组织工作，力争快收、收好，防止一切浪费现象。
    会议指出，各地必须制定具体的收割计划，准备好充足的人力、工具和运输工具，争取及时收割。在已经收割的地方，应立即翻耕。在领导收割的同时，应指导各地进行选种，为下一造准备充足的良种。
    会议还指出，目前各省有部分地方遭受旱灾。抗旱仍然是当前的主要工作之一，必须进一步加强。
