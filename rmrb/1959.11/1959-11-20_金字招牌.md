"Golden Signboard"
By our reporters Zhou Yongkang and Xie Zhilin

　　The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory is the only precision grinder manufacturer in the country. All employees of the factory have always paid great attention to fulfilling contracts on time. Many factories that had dealt with this factory in the past praised them with the term "golden signboard": as long as a contract was signed with the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, there was no need to urge them; the product would definitely be delivered on time.

　　The factory's employees deeply felt that delivering products according to the contract was their duty. However, the factory recently received many telegrams and letters from other places, not only requesting that the contract be fulfilled, but also hoping to receive the machine tools sooner so as to prepare well for the continued Great Leap Forward next year. This posed a new problem for the leaders of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory: how to deliver goods ahead of schedule and better meet the needs of users. They calculated that their factory's products were distributed nationwide, and it would take more than a month to ship from Shanghai to distant places, and ten days to a week or so to closer ones. In the past few years, although the factory had manufactured the products within the contract before the end of the year, some products would not be delivered to the ordering units until February of the following year. If this were to happen again this year, some machine tools would not be able to play their role at the beginning of next year. Therefore, the factory leaders decided to rush out all the products within this year's contract half a month ahead of schedule, and strive to deliver them all to the using units in various places before the end of the year.

　　This requirement from the leadership aroused different reactions among some people. Some cadres in the workshop that manufactures precision grinders believed that precision grinders are different from ordinary grinders, with high technology, many parts, and a long cycle, and others cannot intervene to help. It is already very good to complete the annual plan in terms of quantity and variety by the end of the year. Some people also saw that the factory recently increased the annual plan from 35% to 40% more than last year, and there was only a little over a month left this year, which was very urgent. They felt that it was not very certain to fulfill the contract ahead of schedule.

　　Since the factory launched a vigorous mass movement against right-leaning tendencies and to encourage greater effort, everyone has clearly realized that the current national situation is very good. As an important department of the machine tool industry, it should go all out to supply more and better equipment ahead of schedule. Subsequently, under the direct leadership of the deputy director, an action team was established to ensure that "contracts do not carry over into the new year." This action team includes production, transportation, management, accounting, and other departments.

　　As soon as the action team was established, the cadres of the management section went back to their section and racked their brains. They took out all the contracts for the fourth quarter of this year and analyzed and studied them one by one. The result of the study was that, in addition to ensuring the state's key construction projects, other contracts were scheduled according to the distance of the road and traffic conditions. The Northwest and Southwest regions, which are far from Shanghai and have inconvenient transportation conditions, were ranked first. This would enable these regions to receive their orders before the end of the year; the Northeast and East China, which have convenient transportation, were ranked slightly later; and Shanghai's local contracts were placed last. In this way, it would be possible to ensure that all ordering units could receive their machine tools before the end of the year.

　　In fact, before the action team was established, the workers in the workshops had already been brewing this issue after seeing the Party Central Committee's call to complete the plan ahead of schedule. When the leaders told the workers the specific requirement of "contracts not carrying over into the new year," they immediately received strong support from the masses. During the discussion, the workers said, "With this arrangement, everyone feels more confident." Originally, the workers in the workshop only knew about completing the annual plan ahead of schedule, but they didn't know which products were urgent and which could be delayed. Now that they are lined up in order of priority, the workers also arrange the daily production schedule according to the urgency of the products.

　　Immediately afterwards, each workshop, according to the requirements of various machine tool types and times, calculated a "reverse flow account," with December 15 as the deadline for completing the contracted products. Several workshops found that the most important problem currently was that the parts were not complete, and they also found that if this weak link was not broken now, it would be impossible to complete the tasks stipulated in the contract ahead of schedule even if a concentrated effort was made in mid-December. Everyone launched an attack on this key point. The seventh group of the hydraulic workshop found that eight important parts were missing the most due to the delayed supply of blanks. At the beginning of November, several fitters in the group, such as Hu Shiyao and Cen Yangda, adopted the method of using the first finished product as a template for the second product, which greatly shortened the auxiliary time and increased production efficiency by one to two times. In addition, many workers adopted multi-cutter and multi-blade cutting methods, and every one of the eight types of parts produced was innovative. As a result, the entire group completed two and a half days' worth of work in one day. In the fourth workshop, which specializes in the production of precision grinders, more than 500 types of parts were missing when the contract products for November were inspected at the end of October, and they could not be matched into sets. The workshop carried out an anti-rightist and morale-boosting movement on the one hand, and a labor competition centered on completing sets on the other. Various groups broke the boundaries, and several types of work, such as turning, milling, planing, and drilling, worked together. Any missing parts that are currently most urgently needed can pass through the workshop unimpeded. In the past, after a part was finished in one process, it had to be put down until the next day before the second process could be carried out. Now, as soon as the previous process is completed, the next process is immediately connected. As a result, the parts belonging to this workshop were basically caught up within the first six days of November.

　　Each workshop not only cares about the progress of its own workshop, but they see that as long as one workshop or even one product cannot be delivered on time, it will affect the entire factory's plan arrangements. There is complete unity between workshops, between groups, and between machine tools. At the end of October, the second workshop, which had the heaviest task in the entire factory, was unable to complete the task on time because the supply of castings and forgings was not timely in the previous period. The workshop transferred some workers to assembly work, but it was still too late. At this time, a large number of workers from the third workshop, the fourth workshop, the hydraulic workshop, the repair workshop, and the tool section came to support them. The second workshop had two large surface grinders weighing more than ten tons each. When there was only one week left before the delivery date, the workers in the assembly group had not yet received the complete set of parts. In the past, when this type of machine tool was produced in the fourth workshop, it took them at least half a month to assemble it the fastest. Just when everyone was at a loss, a group of experts from the fourth workshop who had assembled this type of machine tool drove to the second workshop under the leadership of the deputy director of the workshop. The two sides worked together and still assembled all two machine tools within a week. After the workshops supported the second workshop, they saw that although they had passed the hurdle, their tasks would still be very heavy in the future. This time, they took a preemptive approach. Although everyone's tasks were very tight, they still drew a part of the manpower and machine tools to process a batch of parts for the second workshop. The five workshops are currently helping them process more than 100 types of parts, adding up to more than 8,000 work hours.

　　The requirement to complete the contract tasks ahead of schedule has tightened every link. Here, people can see a tense atmosphere everywhere. Some of the cadres in the production planning section are receiving people from the cooperating factories to discuss how to deliver various cooperating parts ahead of schedule; some are calling the casting factory to ask them to change the variety of castings according to the needs of the machine tool factory; in the workshop, a new machine tool has just been painted, and the packaging workers immediately take over and pack it in a wooden box, "The machine tool is made, and it is packed in one day." Dozens of assembled machine tools are neatly arranged along both sides of a large road in the middle of the factory, with the words Urumqi, Kunming, Guiyang, etc. painted on them. Transportation workers are transporting them to the station one by one. These days, sometimes the train carriages arrive in the middle of the night, and they rush to transport them overnight. The workers told us: "If you had come a few days earlier, you could have seen the orders from the Luoyang Tractor Factory and the Luoyang Bearing Factory. Now these machine tools have been delivered to them according to the contract period."

    “金字招牌”
    本报记者　周永康　谢芝麟
    上海机床厂是全国唯一的一家精密磨床制造厂，全厂职工对按期履行合同，一直非常注意，过去和这个厂打过交道的许多工厂，曾用“金字招牌”来称赞他们：只要和上海机床厂签订了合同，不用催，到时间一定能拿到产品。
    这个厂的职工们深深感到按照合同交出产品，这是本分。但是，厂里最近接到外地许多电报和来信，不只是要求按合同办事，而且希望能够早一点拿到机床，好为明年继续跃进做好准备。这给上海机床厂的领导人员提出了新问题：怎样才能提前交货，更好地满足用户需要。他们计算了一下，本厂的产品是面向全国的，从上海运出，远的要花上一个多月，近的也要十天个把星期。过去几年来，厂里虽然把合同以内的产品在年底以前都制造出来了，但是有的产品一直要到隔年2月份才能运到订货单位。如果今年还是这样的话，有些机床就不能在明年一开始发挥作用。于是，厂的领导确定提前半个月把今年合同内的产品全部赶出来，力争在年底以前，全部运到各地的使用单位。
    领导上的这一要求，在有些人中间引起了不同的反应。制造精密磨床的车间有些干部认为，精密磨床不同于一般磨床，技术高，零件多，周期长，别人无法插手帮忙。能在年底按数量、品种完成年度计划，已经很不差了。还有些人看到最近厂里把年度计划从比去年增长35％提高到40％，今年的时间又只有一个多月，非常紧迫，感到再要提前履行合同把握不大。
    工厂里开展轰轰烈烈的反右倾、鼓干劲的群众运动以来，大家明确地认识到当前全国形势很好，作为机床工业的重要部门来说，应该鼓足干劲，提前供应更多更好的设备。接着在副厂长的直接领导下，成立了合同不过年的行动小组。这个行动小组包括生产、运输、经理、会计等部门。
    行动小组一成立，经理科的干部回到科里就大动脑筋，他们把今年第四季度的合同全部拿出来，一张一张进行分析研究，研究的结果，除了保证国家的重点建设以外，其它合同根据路的远近，交通情况，排出了进度。把西北、西南等离上海较远，交通条件又不便利的地区排在最前面。这样就能够使这些地区在年底以前拿到订货；东北和华东这些交通方便的地区，排得稍晚一点；上海本地的合同放在最后。这样一来，就有可能保证所有的订货单位在年底以前都能拿到机床。
    其实，在行动小组成立以前，车间里的工人们看到了党中央发出提前完成计划的号召以后，就早已酝酿这个问题了。当领导上把“合同不过年”的具体要求告诉工人时，立即得到了群众的大力支持。工人们在讨论的时候，都说：“这样安排，大家心里更有底了。”原来，过去车间里工人只知道提前完成年计划，但不知道哪个产品是急件，哪个可以晚一点。现在这样前后一排队，工人们也都根据产品的轻重缓急，来安排日常生产进度了。
    紧接着，各个车间按照各种机床品种、时间的要求，以12月15日为完成合同产品的限期，算了一笔“倒流水账”。几个车间都发现，要如期完成合同产品，当前最主要的问题是零件不能成套，同时也发现，如果现在不突破这个薄弱环节，到12月中旬再进行突击，也无法提前完成合同所规定的任务。大家针对这一关键，展开围攻。液压车间第七小组发现有八种重要零件，由于毛坯供应脱期，缺得最多。在11月初，小组里的胡世尧、岑仰达等几个钳工，采用第一个成品给第二个产品做模子的办法，辅助时间大大缩短，生产效率提高一倍到两倍。另外还有许多工人采取多刀多刃的切削方法，生产的八种零件样样都有革新，结果全组一天就完成了二天半的工作量。在专门生产精密磨床的第四车间，在10月底检查11月份合同产品时，缺少五百多种零件，配不成套。车间里一方面开展反右倾、鼓干劲的运动，一方面开展了以成套为中心的劳动竞赛。各小组打破界线，车、铣、刨、钻几个工种一起动手，凡是目前最急需的缺件，在车间里通行无阻。过去一个零件一道工序结束，至少要放到第二天再进行第二道工序。现在上一道做完，马上接下一道，结果在11月份头六天内，属于本车间加工的零件基本上都赶齐了。
    各个车间不仅关心本车间的进度，他们看到只要有一个车间甚至一种产品不能如期交货，就会影响整个工厂的计划安排，车间之间、小组之间、机床之间，完全打成了一片。10月底，全厂任务最重的第二车间因为前一时期铸件、锻件供应不及时，等到全部做好，已快到月底，车间里把一部分工人调做装配工作，还是来不及。这时候，第三车间、第四车间、液压车间、修理车间、工具科，大批工人前来支援他们。第二车间有两台十多吨重的大型平面磨床，距交货日期只有一个星期的时候，装配组里工人还没有拿到成套零件。而这种机床过去在第四车间生产时，他们装得最快也要半个月。大家正在束手无策的时候，第四车间一批装过这种机床的能手在车间副主任的率领下，开到第二车间。双方一起动手，在一个星期内照样把两台机床全部装了出来。各车间在支援第二车间以后，看到他们虽然过了关，今后任务仍旧很重，这次他们采取了先下手为强的办法，虽然大家自己任务都很紧张，还是抽出一部分人力和机床，代第二车间加工一批零件。五个车间正在帮助他们加工的零件共有一百多种，加起来有八千多个工时。
    提前完成合同任务的要求，把各个环节扣得更紧了。在这里，人们到处可以看到一片紧张的气氛。生产计划科的干部们，有的正在接待协作厂的来人，商量如何使各种协作件提前交货；有的打电话给铸件厂，要求他们根据机床厂的需要改变铸件的品种；车间里，一台新机床，刚刚喷好油漆，包装工人马上接上来，用木箱把它装起来，“机床做好，一天装好”。沿着工厂中间一条大道的两旁，几十台已经装好的机床，整齐地排列着，上面漆着乌鲁木齐、昆明、贵阳等字样。运输工人们正在一台台运往车站。这几天，有时车皮半夜赶到，他们就漏夜抢运，工人们对我们说：“你们如果早来几天，还可以看到洛阳拖拉机厂、洛阳轴承厂的订货，现在这些机床都已经按照合同期限交给他们了。”
