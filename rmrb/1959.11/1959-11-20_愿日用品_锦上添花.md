    Wishing Daily Necessities Could Be "Gilded"
    Our artists and painters have meticulously designed many beautiful patterns for flower cloths, washbasins, thermos bottles, and other items for the masses. However, the patterns and trademarks of some other daily necessities are not so satisfactory. Some handkerchiefs even have one of the "Four Pests," the rat, depicted on them. Furthermore, a pair of socks produced by a Shanghai sock factory has a trademark called "Wolf-Dog Brand," featuring a wolf's head and a dog's head side by side, with the wolf's head even sporting a long, blood-red tongue, making people find it repulsive at first glance. Why can't our art designers create better patterns on these few everyday items? Why not reflect some images with the spirit of the times—the spirit of the Great Leap Forward—on daily necessities?

### 愿日用品“锦上添花”

    愿日用品“锦上添花”
    我们的美术家、画师们曾为广大群众精心设计了许多花布、脸盆、热水瓶等极为漂亮的图案花样。但是还有一些日用品，它们的图案和商标却不够令人满意。有些手帕上面，甚至连“四害”之一的老鼠也画上了。还有一双上海一个机袜厂出品的长袜子的商标叫“狼狗牌”，一个狼头和一个狗头并列，在狼头的嘴里还吐着血红的长舌头，使人一见就讨厌。为什么我们的美工画师不可以在这少数日常生活用品上也绘制出更好的图案呢？为什么不在日用品上也反映一些具有时代气息——大跃进气息的图画呢？
