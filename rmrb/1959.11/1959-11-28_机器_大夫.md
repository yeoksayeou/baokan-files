Machine "Doctors"
By our reporter Li Zhengjie

    The looms clatter rhythmically. While the weaver Ma Jinxi is busy changing shuttles and joining broken threads, one of the looms suddenly stops. "Damn, can't weave a whole piece of cloth now." Ma Jinxi is both distressed and anxious. Just then, the "machine doctor" Yan Xibao, carrying his tools and "medicine kit," arrives. Yan Xibao immediately and carefully examines the "patient." After skillfully "diagnosing" several parts, he quickly identifies the key issue: the shuttle stick is reversed. The front and back of the shuttle stick are almost identical, and it would be difficult to spot without rich experience, but it can't escape the eyes of the "machine doctor." In less than twenty minutes, Yan Xibao neatly restores the "patient" to full health. Ma Jinxi, who had been troubled by this machine, later tells Yan Xibao repeatedly that he can handle all ten looms under his care with ease and fulfill his plan in full every day.

    In the No. 2 Cloth Workshop of Tianjin Second Cotton Textile Factory, there is a team of "doctors" like Yan Xibao who specialize in treating machines—the maintenance and repair workers who are working diligently. They know the more than two thousand looms in the entire workshop inside and out. They thoroughly understand the performance and characteristics of each machine's innards—eight or nine hundred parts—and store them in their minds. Yan Xibao, with more than twenty years of experience, can detect excessive friction by the smell. Other workers have also accumulated rich maintenance experience. For example, Master Zhang Jiarui, relying on his more than thirty years of experience, can subtly point out where a screw is loose or missing from the sound of the machine. Thanks to the workers' meticulous maintenance, the thousands of old looms in the entire workshop have maintained their "youthfulness" and are unleashing greater potential in the new situation of high-speed production.

    The "machine doctors" have also encountered difficult-to-treat diseases. When the factory began to implement high-speed production, the speed of the looms suddenly increased from 180 revolutions per minute to more than 230 revolutions per minute. New problems arose, and the consumption of leather parts greatly increased. The consumption of leather pickers sometimes required the hides of ten water buffaloes in a single day. This also brought a lot of trouble to the production of the weavers. At that time, the small red tags indicating faults on the machines popped up one after another. The "machine doctors" were busy treating this epidemic all day long. Yan Xibao was also repairing and replacing leather pickers from morning till night. Just after treating one machine, he looked up and saw small red tags appearing one after another. Yan Xibao was determined to cure this intractable disease. Whether on the way home or lying in bed, he constantly asked himself questions: Why do leather pickers break more often after high-speed operation? How can we reduce the impact force? As soon as he entered the factory, he stayed by the machine to study, his clothes soaked with sweat and his hands covered with grease. He disassembled the parts to measure and then reassembled them to measure, experimenting again and again. He finally caught the "culprit" and boldly improved the parts, reducing the impact force. This not only reduced the amount of leather pickers used but also reduced the amount of other leather and wooden parts used. Through his major reforms and minor improvements, the consumption of wooden and leather parts on the 120 machines under his management was reduced by 75%.

    There are many machine ailments, but the "doctors" have even more solutions. Master Zhang Jiarui transformed the structure of the leather ring seat, proposing a new way to transform old machines. Master Hou Changlin made the three main shafts of the loom highly sensitive, solving a long-standing problem. They know the machines they care for and treat inside and out. Every machine in the entire workshop has a "medical record card," and any major or minor problems that have occurred are recorded in detail on the "medical record."

    The masters not only "treat diseases" but also take active preventive measures to strengthen maintenance. In addition to major and minor repairs carried out on the machines according to a certain cycle, a series of practices such as key inspections every ten days, cyclical inspections every day, and special component inspections have also been closely followed. They often visit weavers to check on the operation of the machines, and any small problems are immediately tracked down. Once, Master Wei Enrong found that a loom was always breaking weft threads, but the experienced Master Wei could not diagnose the cause at once. He repeatedly searched and studied, and it turned out that the weft stop was placed a little too far forward. In a moment, the loom was running flawlessly.

    The machines that the masters take great care of are giving full play to their potential. Since the beginning of this year, this workshop has not only overfulfilled its plan every month, but also achieved a first-class product rate of over 96% for finished cloth and a first-class product rate of 99.7% for warehousing, the highest level. The quality of the cloth has always been rated as first-class in the country. These excellent results are permeated with the hard work of the "machine doctors."

    机器“大夫”
    本报记者　李正杰
    织布机有节奏地响着，当车工马金喜正在紧张换梭、接头的时候，一台织布机突然停住了。“糟糕，织不成整匹布了。”马金喜又心痛又着急，这时候，带着工具、背着
  “药箱”的“机器大夫”阎锡宝，恰好赶到了。阎锡宝立即仔细地检查了这台“病号”。他熟练地“诊断”了几个部件以后，很快就抓住了要害，原来梭棍上反了。梭棍的正反面本来相差无几，如果没有丰富的经验是很难看出的，但它却瞒不过“机器大夫”的眼睛。前后不到二十分钟，阎锡宝就干净俐落地使这台“病号”完全恢复了健康。曾经为这台机器烦恼过的马金喜，以后不断告诉阎锡宝，他看管的十台织布机，台台得心应手，天天全面完成计划。
    在天津第二棉纺织厂二布场，有一支像阎锡宝一样的专门给机器治病的“大夫”——保全、保养工人在辛勤地劳动着。他们把全布场两千多台织布机摸得又熟又透，每台机器的内脏——八、九百个部件的性能、脾气，都透彻地装在自己的脑子里。有二十多年工龄的阎锡宝，就能凭气味发觉什么地方磨擦太大。至于其他工人，也都积累了丰富的维修经验。像张家瑞老师傅，依靠他三十多年来的经验，在机器的一片响声中，能够细微地指出什么地方螺丝松了、什么地方缺了螺丝。由于工人们的精心维修，全布场几千台老织布机一直“青春常在”，在高速生产的新形势下，发挥出更大的潜力。
    “机器大夫”也遇到过难以治疗的病症。当工厂开始实行高速生产时，织布机的速度一下子由一百八十转提高到二百三十转以上，新问题出现了，皮制机件的消耗大大增多。皮仁的消耗，有时一昼夜就要用掉十条大水牛的牛皮。同时也给织布工人的生产带来了很多麻烦。那时，机器上树立起的发生故障的小红牌，此起彼落。“机器大夫”们也就整天忙着突击治疗这种流行性疾病。阎锡宝也是从早到晚地修着、换着皮仁，刚治好一台机器，一抬头，前面又接二连三地出现小红牌。阎锡宝下定决心根治这项疑难病症，无论是回家的路上还是躺在床上，他不断地给自己提出问号，为什么高速化以后皮仁会坏的多？怎样才能降低打力……一进厂，他就守在机器旁边研究，汗水湿透了衣服，双手沾满了油污，拆下机件测算，然后装上再测算，一次又一次地试验着。他终于抓住了“小辫子”，大胆地改进了机件，降低了打力。不仅减少了皮仁用量，而且还减少了其他皮制和木制机件的用量。经过他的大改革、小改进，他所负责管理的一百二十台机器，木制、皮制机件的用量降低了75％。
    机器病多，没有“大夫”的办法多。张家瑞老师傅改造了皮圈座架的结构，为改造老机器提出了新途径；侯长林老师傅使织布机三个主轴达到高度的灵敏性，解决了长期办不到的问题。他们所看护、治疗的机器，人人心中有数，全布场每一台机器都有“病历卡片”，无论出过什么大小毛病，都详详细细地记录在“病历表”上。
    老师傅们不光是“治病”，还采取了积极预防，加强调养的措施。机器除了按一定周期进行大修和小修以外，十天一周期的重点检修、一天一周期的巡回检修和专件检修等一系列的作法也紧紧地跟上了。他们经常访问挡车工机器运转的情况，有一点小毛病立即跟踪追击。有一次，魏恩荣老师傅发现一台布机总断纬线，经验丰富的魏师傅却一下子没有诊断出原因来。他又反复寻找、研究，原来是纬停放得偏前了一点造成的。一会功夫，这台布机就运转得没有一点可挑剔的地方了。
    老师傅们倍加爱护的机器，充分发挥出潜力，这个布场今年以来，不但月月超额完成计划，而且下机一等品率达到96％以上，入库一等品率达到99.7％的最高水平，布的质量一直被评为全国第一流的。这些优异的成绩，渗透着“机器大夫”们的心血。
