    With Momentum, Planning, and Depth
    —Henan Daily's Coverage of Water Conservancy Construction in the Past Half Month
    In the past half month, Henan Daily has concentrated on continuously reporting on the vigorous new upsurge of water conservancy construction in the province; this coverage has great momentum, wide scope, and strong planning.
    Henan Daily first focused on discussing the situation and laying out tasks. Henan Province's water conservancy construction this winter and next spring has shifted from mainly eliminating water hazards to a new stage focused on developing water resources and comprehensive development. This year, more than 30 large-scale backbone projects will be newly started, expanded, and continued, along with nearly a thousand medium-sized backbone projects. In its editorials on the 4th, 12th, and 13th, Henan Daily repeatedly discussed the new situation facing the people of the province, explaining the great significance of large-scale water conservancy and natural transformation for "rapidly changing the face of Henan." At the same time, it cited facts to show that due to the consolidation and development of the people's communes, the early start of this year's water conservancy construction, good preparatory work, and the sufficient drive of cadres and the masses, extremely favorable conditions have been created for large-scale water conservancy movements, especially for the construction of large and medium-sized water conservancy projects.
    Henan Daily also paid attention to conducting ideological education from different perspectives and providing specific guidance to the movement. In its commentaries and news reports, the newspaper analyzed and criticized right-leaning conservative thoughts such as "water conservancy construction has reached its peak" and "large-scale water conservancy is not worth the cost"; and introduced the example of Lin County organizing report groups to go to the countryside to carry out ideological mobilization work. The report from Lin County showed that large-scale water conservancy must be led by politics. After the county organized report groups to go to the countryside to promote propaganda, the commune members immediately devoted themselves to the water conservancy movement, determined to "vigorously develop water conservancy and get grain from water"; many commune members said: "Slackening is not allowed," "Only people can overcome difficulties, and difficulties cannot scare people." In order to help carry out the work, the newspaper successively published editorials on vigorously launching mass movements, various departments actively supporting water conservancy construction, and resolutely grasping scientific and technological work in water conservancy. It emphasized that letting the masses go all out, vigorously launching mass movements, and organizing upsurges is the specific application of the Party's mass line in water conservancy work, so as to fight a decisive battle to change the natural face of Henan. The support of various departments for water conservancy construction must have the viewpoint of giving priority to the collective before the individual, starting from the overall situation; in the work arrangement, the current focus of support should be on striving for water conservancy mechanization as soon as possible, and supplying the urgent needs of water conservancy construction.
    This report's regional balance is relatively good. Within half a month, Henan Daily continuously published news on the first page headline about the water conservancy movement in Kaifeng, Xinxiang, Nanyang, Xuchang, Luoyang and other regions. Through these reports, the scale and momentum of the movement in various regions of the province and the different characteristics of each place are reflected. For example, Luoyang region takes soil and water conservation as the main guideline, and vigorously develops mountain and water management; Nanyang region prepared for the upsurge of water conservancy movement during drought resistance and wheat planting, and established more than 3,000 tool factories, which smoothly turned to water conservancy construction; Xinxiang region wants to achieve "defeating the high-lying land, and double insurance in the plains," and so on. In addition, the newspaper also introduced the Red Flag typical example of completing the hundred-day task in twenty days at high speed, as well as some technical experiences of large blasting on construction sites. These are all issues worthy of reporting in the water conservancy movement.
    Henan Daily also paid attention to reporting on the living problems on water conservancy construction sites. In the newspapers of the 11th and 18th, it relatively concentratedly put forward that it is necessary to care about the living arrangements of water conservancy construction sites. The reports include: how a commune comprehensively arranges the life of the construction site, greatly improving labor efficiency; some construction sites actively implement winter disease prevention programs to ensure the physical health of the masses on the construction site; and some counties send a large number of medical staff to serve on the construction site, and so on. The newspaper on the 18th also published an editorial "Arranging the Life of the Water Conservancy Army," which proposed that: the first thing to do on the construction site is to run the construction site cafeteria well, ensuring that everyone eats enough, eats well, saves money, and eats hot food; it is necessary to ensure access to clean water, everyone has cotton clothes and quilts, shoes and socks, adequate rest, especially caring for the health of women, and doing a good job in safety work. The editorial requires all construction sites to seize the time to do these tasks well, further stimulate the labor enthusiasm of water conservancy builders, improve labor efficiency, and greatly accelerate the progress of the project.

### 有声势，有计划，有深度——河南日报半月来对水利建设的报道

    有声势，有计划，有深度
    ——河南日报半月来对水利建设的报道
    近半月来，河南日报集中连续地报道了全省蓬勃发展的水利建设新高潮；这个报道声势大，方面广，计划性强。
    河南日报首先注意讲形势、摆任务。河南省今冬明春的水利建设，已经由以除水害为主，走上以兴水利为主、综合开发的新阶段。今年开工新建、扩建和继续修建的大型骨干工程有三十多处，中型骨干工程近千处。河南日报在4日、12日、13日的社论中，反复地讲了摆在全省人民面前的这个新形势，说明大兴水利、改造自然对“迅速改变河南面貌”的巨大意义。同时又列举事实说明：由于人民公社的巩固和发展；由于今年水利建设动手早，准备工作做的好，干部和群众的干劲足，就为大搞水利运动、特别是为兴修大中型水利工程，创造了极为有利的条件。
    河南日报也注意到从不同角度做思想教育工作，对运动进行具体指导。报纸在评论和新闻中，分析和批判了“水利建设到顶了”、“大办水利得不偿失”等右倾保守思想；并介绍了林县组织报告团下乡进行思想动员工作的事例。林县的报道说明，大兴水利就必须政治挂帅。这个县组织报告团下乡宣传以后，社员们立即投入水利运动，要“大搞水利，向水要粮”；许多社员说：“松劲要不得”，“只有人战胜困难，不能叫困难吓住人”。为了帮助开展工作，报纸先后发表了大搞群众运动、各部门积极支援水利建设、坚决抓好水利科学技术工作的社论。强调指出：放手让群众去做，大搞群众运动、组织高潮，是党的群众路线在水利工作方面的具体运用，这样才能打好改变河南自然面貌的决定性的一仗。而各部门对水利建设的支援，又必须有先大公后小公、从全面出发的观点；在工作安排上，要把当前支援重点，放在尽快争取水利机械化方面，供应水利建设的紧迫需要。
    这项报道的地区平衡作得比较好。河南日报在半个月内，就在一版头条的地位，连续发表了开封、新乡、南阳、许昌、洛阳等专区开展水利运动的消息。通过这些报道，反映出运动在全省各个地区的规模和声势，和各地的不同特点。例如：洛阳专区以水土保持为纲，大搞治山治水；南阳专区在抗旱种麦的时候，就为水利运动高潮作准备，办起了三千多个工具厂，顺利转上了水利建设；新乡专区要做到“战胜高岗地，平原双保险”，等等。除此之外，报纸还介绍了百日任务二十天完成的高速度施工的红旗典型，以及一些工地实行大爆破的技术经验。这些都是水利运动中值得报道的问题。
    河南日报还注意报道了水利工地上的生活问题。在11、18两日的报上，比较集中地提出必须关心水利工地的生活安排。报道的有：一个公社如何全面安排工地生活，使劳动效率大大提高；有的工地积极贯彻冬季防病方案，来确保工地上群众的身体健康；以及有些县派大批医务人员去到工地服务，等等。18日的报纸并发表了“安排好水利大军的生活”的社论，其中提出：在工地上首先要办好工地食堂，保证大家吃饱吃好吃省吃热；要保证吃甜水，人人有棉衣棉被、有鞋有袜，有适当休息，特别关心妇女的健康，并且做好安全工作。社论要求各个工地抓紧时间，做好这些工作，更加激发水利建设者的劳动热情，提高劳动效率，大大加速工程的进展。
