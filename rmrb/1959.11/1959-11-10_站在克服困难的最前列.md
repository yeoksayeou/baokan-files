Standing at the Forefront of Overcoming Difficulties
　　Wang Pu

    The representatives of every advanced collective and advanced producer at the Heroes' Conference have brought their valuable experiences. These experiences have commonalities, yet each has its own unique strengths. Some are more prominent in this aspect, while others excel in another. Presenting everyone's "treasures" creates a dazzling and delightful spectacle. Therefore, the speech of each representative aroused great interest and moved everyone. For example, after many representatives listened to the speech of Zhang Baifa, the leader of the famous steel bar worker youth shock brigade from Beijing, they felt their courage to overcome difficulties strengthened. Some representatives said: "Zhang Baifa's team proactively overcomes difficulties and can support other teams. This spirit is most admirable." Others said: "In the future, we must be proactive, work hard and cleverly, and do everything possible to overcome difficulties."

    Why did the deeds of Zhang Baifa's team move others? This is mainly because they treat difficulties with a true sense of ownership. They have two slogans: "Stand at the forefront of overcoming difficulties!" "No matter how many difficulties there are, we must make them yield!" In the spring of 1956, they were transferred to work on the construction site of the Beijing Film Printing Factory. There was a particularly large amount of steel bar work in this project, with varying specifications. Using iron wire to tie them was slower and wasted more steel than electric welding. In order to speed up the project and save steel, they suggested that the leadership adopt electric welding. However, they did not know how to weld. There were three paths for them to choose: 1. Wait for welders to be transferred in; 2. Continue to use iron wire to tie; 3. Quickly learn electric welding themselves. The first and second options were shortcuts to bypass difficulties and bow to them, but they did not take them. Starting from the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical, they chose the third path, which was the most difficult for them at the time. What was the result? They mastered electric welding technology, gained speed, and saved thirty-six tons of steel. The difficulty yielded to them! Over the past few years, they have been advancing by improving their skills to overcome difficulties one by one. Now, this team has mastered nineteen kinds of construction techniques, including electric welding, gas welding, concrete pouring, and installing plumbing equipment. On average, each person has learned six techniques.

    When encountering difficulties in the Great Leap Forward, should we stand at the forefront of overcoming difficulties like Zhang Baifa's team, or should we wait for others to solve the problem for you? These are two different styles. Socialist construction is a great undertaking that turns the world upside down. It is not surprising to encounter some difficulties. The difficulties we are talking about are difficulties in the midst of economic upsurge, difficulties in the midst of great strides forward. When we talk about difficulties, we usually refer to difficulties such as increasing production by a few more percentage points on the basis of the Great Leap Forward, increasing labor efficiency by a few more percentage points, increasing the qualified rate or first-class product rate by a few more percentage points, and reducing costs by a few more percentage points, rather than the desperate and declining difficulties of the kind of crises that often occur in the capitalist world. Our difficulties can be overcome through effort. Overcoming difficulties means winning the Great Leap Forward. Standing at the forefront of overcoming difficulties means standing at the forefront of the Great Leap Forward. Therefore, it can be said that the attitude towards difficulties is the attitude towards the General Line, and the attitude towards building socialism at high speed. Those who truly support the General Line and truly want to leap forward will not fail to stand up straight and face difficulties head-on.

    "Stand at the forefront of overcoming difficulties!" This is a manifestation of the will and determination of China's working class to quickly change the "poor and blank" face of the motherland and quickly build a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. As an advanced producer, a pace-setter of the Great Leap Forward, one must first resolutely stand at the forefront of overcoming difficulties and be a pioneer in overcoming difficulties!

    站在克服困难的最前列
    王朴
    群英会上每一个先进集体的代表和先进生产者都带来了自己的宝贵经验。这些经验有共同之处，又各有千秋。有的在这一点上比较突出，有的在另一点上比较突出。把大家的“宝”都献出来，真是琳琅满目，美不胜收。所以，每一位代表的发言，都引起大家的莫大兴趣，都使大家感动。例如许多代表听了北京代表、著名的钢筋工青年突击队队长张百发的发言以后，都感到增强了克服困难的勇气。有的代表说：“张百发工作队主动克服困难，并能支援别的队，这种精神最可钦佩。”有的说：“今后一定积极主动，苦干加巧干，千方百计克服困难。”
    张百发工作队的事迹为什么感动了别人呢？这主要是因为他们以真正的主人翁态度对待困难。他们有两句口号：“要站在克服困难的最前列！”“困难再多，也要叫它屈服！”1956年春天，他们被调到北京电影影片洗印厂工地干活。这项工程的钢筋活特别多，规格大小不一，用铁丝绑扎比电焊又慢又费钢材。为了加快工程进度和节约钢材，他们建议领导上采用电焊焊接。可是他们不会电焊。有三条道路让他们选择：一、坐等调电焊工来；二、照旧用铁丝绑；三、自己迅速学会电焊。第一和第二条是绕过困难、向困难低头的便道，他们没有走。他们从多快好省的要求出发，选择了当时对他们说来最艰难的第三条道路。结果呢？他们掌握了电焊技术，盈得了速度，又节约了三十六吨钢材。困难向他们低头了！几年来，他们就是以提高自己的本领来战胜一个一个困难前进的。现在，这个队已经掌握了电焊、汽焊、浇灌混凝土、安装水暖设备等十九种建筑技术，平均每人都学会了六种技术。
    在跃进中遇到了困难，是像张百发工作队那样，站在克服困难的最前列呢，还是等待别人来替你解决问题呢？这是两种不同的风格。社会主义建设是一项翻天复地的伟大事业，遇到点困难，是毫不足怪的。我们所说的困难，是经济高涨中的困难，是大踏步地前进中的困难。我们讲到困难的时候，通常是指在跃进的基础上，产量再提高百分之几、劳动效率再提高百分之几、质量合格率或者一等品率再提高百分之几、成本再降低百分之几等等的困难，而不是资本主义世界经常发生的那种危机的绝望的没落中的困难。我们的困难是经过努力可以克服的，战胜了困难，就争得了跃进。站在克服困难的最前列，就是站在跃进的最前列。所以，可以说，对待困难的态度，就是对待总路线的态度，就是对待高速度建设社会主义的态度。真正拥护总路线，真正要跃进的人，没有不挺起胸脯，迎着困难前进的。
    “站在克服困难的最前列！”这是我国工人阶级要求迅速改变祖国“一穷二白”面貌，迅速建设一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国的意志和决心的表现。作为大跃进标兵的先进生产者，必须首先坚决地站在克服困难的最前列，做克服困难的先锋！
