According to the Henan Daily: A winter production campaign centered on water conservancy construction, with thousands upon thousands of people working together, has been fully launched in the deep mountain area of Linxian County. 150,000 commune members have launched an offensive against the Taihang Mountains and the four major river systems of Qi, Xi, Huan, and Zhang. Fifteen large and medium-sized canals and reservoirs have already started construction, and small reservoirs, canals, dry ponds, and water wells are also under construction simultaneously. Sixteen power stations are under full construction, three of which are generating electricity while being built. More than 20 small teams have begun using electric lights for illumination. More than 50,000 commune members are vigorously engaged in other production.

This year, Linxian County achieved an all-around bumper harvest in autumn industrial and agricultural production. After publicizing and implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, cadres have even greater drive and commune members have even higher labor enthusiasm. The entire county, from within the Party to outside the Party, from bottom to top, has formulated a plan for continued leap forward in production this winter and next spring, centered on the water conservancy movement. The plan calls for major water conservancy projects to increase the irrigated area to 750,000 mu (from the original 550,000 mu), accounting for 88% of the total cultivated land; to release 15 million fish; to build 16 hydroelectric power stations using water power, solving the power needs of most of the county's factories and mines and the lighting problems of 49% of the rural commune members by the end of the year; and to build 242 hydraulic power stations for various processing purposes. The county party committee has also put forward specific requirements for wheat field management and diversified operations. This is a magnificent plan. The vast majority of cadres and masses are full of confidence and have quickly plunged into the movement, determined to realize this plan.

However, a small number of cadres with conservative ideas said: "There are few laborers, we can only leap forward in one area, not in all areas," "It's a torment for people to engage in water conservancy in the winter, it's better to do it in the spring," and so on. Some communes and teams that have already achieved water conservancy are satisfied with the status quo. Communes and teams in high mountain areas and with poor water conservancy conditions lack confidence; there is also departmentalism, and they are unwilling to cooperate with other communes and teams. The county party committee believes that this is the main obstacle to launching a winter production upsurge. If the erroneous thinking of individual cadres such as "difficulty theory" and "pessimistic theory" are not resolved, the Party's general line cannot be fully and correctly implemented. Therefore, the county party committee put forward the slogan of "put politics in command, launch mass movements in a big way" and adopted four measures:

	Publicize Policies to Raise Awareness
	Summarize Experiences to Boost Enthusiasm

The county party committee members took the lead, organizing 16 report groups, with more than 2,000 cadres going deep into communes, teams, factories, and mines to publicize and summarize the great power of the general line and the people's communes, summarize the achievements of the leap forward in the past ten years since the founding of the country, especially in 1958 and 1959; summarize the benefits of large-scale water conservancy projects, publicize the principles and plans for water conservancy construction this winter and next spring; summarize the experience of implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production increase, publicize wheat management measures; summarize the role of large-scale collaboration and large-scale corps operations, publicize the effects of implementing "four modernizations," and mobilize the masses to launch a great airing of views, great contending, and great debate. In half a month, more than 240,000 big-character posters were posted throughout the county, putting forward more than 410,000 opinions of various kinds. The two distinctly different examples of the Heshan Commune and the Nanlingyang and Langlei brigades of the Yaocun Commune were very educational for everyone: In the past, everyone said, "Nanlingyang is a good place, the self-flowing canal irrigates all sides, the old man doesn't rain for nine years, and there is a bumper harvest for ten years." However, because some leading cadres could not correctly implement the general line and emphasized "difficulties" everywhere, grain production has increased very little in recent years, and the commune's production contract was not completed this year either. The Langlei brigade, which is close to the Nanlingyang brigade, is a completely different scene. The natural conditions in the past were: "Three mountains, four depressions, and nine gullies, only one harvest out of ten years, drought and flood disasters are difficult to resist, and we often flee famine outside." After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the production of this team has been increasing year by year. Especially in recent years, due to the correct implementation of the Party's various policies by cadres and the masses, they have been full of energy and strived for progress. This year, the yield per mu reached 994 jin, exceeding the commune's production contract. Vivid examples have made cadres and commune members understand that as long as they boost their energy, the leap forward will never end. In the Yuan Kang Commune's summary of the achievements in water conservancy construction, after the commune members calculated the output comparison account between 8,000 mu of dry land converted to water land, they all said: "We must not slacken our efforts, we need to boost our energy again, and we must vigorously engage in water conservancy to get grain from the water." The commune members are determined to open 48 canals and build 3 reservoirs to completely realize high mountain water conservancy for 8,000 mu of mountain slope terraces.

	Physical Exhibitions Broaden Horizons
	Visiting and Comparing Clarify Direction

Every commune holds an exhibition hall, and every team establishes an exhibition shed. This is a good method for cadres and the masses to educate themselves. Some commune members in the Dong Yao Commune originally had little enthusiasm for large-scale water conservancy, saying: "The mountains are high and there are many stones, the water source is scarce, and there is no hope." By organizing a visit to the exhibition hall, the commune members saw that the entire commune has accumulated more than 800,000 yuan of public funds in the past few years, has 12 tractors and various machines, and has trained more than 1,700 water conservancy technicians. Especially after communization, there are no more water conservancy disputes, and labor, tools, economy, and technology can be used in a unified and concentrated manner, etc., they believe that large-scale water conservancy can be carried out. Liu Lao San, deputy secretary of the Party committee, also led 50 representatives of the masses to visit the Hero Canal project. After seeing it, the commune members were even more enthusiastic, saying: If Hejian and other communes can build the Hero Canal from the Taihang Mountains, it is even no problem for us to build branch canals from the Baiyun Mountains. So the entire commune drew 4,500 young and strong people to form 250 shock teams, carrying tools, carrying pots and bowls, and taking quilts to rush to the water conservancy construction site day and night.

	Planting Red Flags and Establishing Pace-Setters
	Launching Competitions to Strive for Progress

Planting red flags and establishing pace-setters has further promoted the movement to strive for progress and catch up with the advanced. On the basis of the basic completion of the three autumn harvests, the entire county selected 5 advanced communes, 57 brigades, 872 teams, 2,728 groups, and more than 57,000 model commune members. They are also the leaders of the winter production movement. Yaocun Commune, which used to be a third-class area, was rated as an advanced unit in this year's three autumn harvests, and the surrounding communes organized cadres and commune members to visit and learn from the commune's experience. After visiting the Chengguan Commune, the commune members said: "If Yaocun can become advanced, we can also work hard this winter and be determined to change our face." They wrote 4,750 letters of determination, and more than 7,000 male and female laborers demanded to go to the mountains to build water conservancy. After the Jiu (Nine) Small Team of the Hejian Brigade of the Hejian Commune was selected as a model team, the commune members of the Yi (One) Small Team immediately proposed to compete with the Jiu Team on the conditions of being more advanced in indicators, more specific in measures, more enthusiastic in work, and more significant in achievements. The entire brigade quickly launched a competition between teams, between groups, and between people.

	Promote the Communist Spirit
	Carry out Collaboration and Mutual Support in a Big Way

By checking tasks and calculating labor, checking cash and calculating needs, checking materials and calculating inventory, and checking technology and calculating strength, everyone has clarified the importance of carrying out large-scale collaboration; especially by summarizing the achievements of carrying out large-scale collaboration in the past few years, they have further criticized departmentalism and right-leaning emotions. The Yuan Kang, Xiao Dian, Dong Yao, Cai Sang, Cheng Guan and other eight communes actively proposed to cooperate in building the Gongshang Reservoir, so that more than 500,000 mu of land in seven communes can be completely water conservancy. Through debate, the commune members of Shangzhuang Brigade of Hejian Commune said: "If Shandi (Mountain Area) had not supported us in building water conservancy last year, we would never have achieved such great achievements. We must help the commune members in the high mountains to build water conservancy this year." Under the initiative of this team, 500 laborers were drawn from 14 flat-land teams in the entire commune to cooperate with the Lujialing team on the top of the Taihang Mountains to open a canal around the mountain, build a pumping station, and build a reservoir, so that 1,400 mu of land in the Lujialing team can be water conservancy. Fourteen communes, 175 brigades, 3,070 teams, and 6,820 groups have carried out collaboration in the entire county, with a total of more than 40,000 collaborating laborers, more than 70,000 tools, more than one million yuan in funds, and more than 1,800 technicians. Because of mutual collaboration and support, various difficulties in the production movement have been overcome, and the upsurge of winter production has been advancing wave after wave.

    大兴水利必须政治挂帅
    林县组织报告团宣传总路线大搞群众运动
    社员方向明确斗志昂扬掀起水利建设高潮
    据河南日报消息：千军万马齐上阵的、以水利建设为中心的冬季生产运动已在深山区林县全面展开。十五万名社员向太行山和淇、淅、洹、漳四大河系展开了攻势。已动工的大、中型水渠、水库十五处，小型水库、水渠、旱池、水井、旱井也一齐动工。十六个电站全面施工，其中有三个电站边施工边发电，已有二十多个小队开始用电灯照明。五万多名社员大搞其它生产。
    今年林县秋季工农业生产取得了全面丰收。通过宣传贯彻党的八届八中全会精神后，干部干劲更大，社员劳动热情更高。全县从党内到党外，由下而上制订出了今冬明春以水利运动为中心的生产继续跃进的规划。要求大修水利，使水浇地面积达到七十五万亩（原有五十五万亩），占总耕地88％；放鱼一千五百万尾；利用水力兴建水电站十六个，年底解决全县绝大部分厂矿动力和农村49％的社员照明问题；建水力动力站二百四十二个，进行各种加工。县委对麦田管理、多种经营也提出了具体要求。这是个宏伟的计划。绝大部分干部、群众信心十足，迅速投入运动，决心实现这个计划。
    但是，一小部分有保守思想的干部却说：“劳力少，只能一项跃进不能全面跃进”，“冬天大搞水利人受罪，不如到明年春天再搞”等等。有些已经实现水利化的社、队，满足现状。高山区和水利条件差的社、队信心不高；还有本位主义思想，不愿和外社、外队协作。县委认为这是掀起冬季生产高潮的主要阻力，不解决个别干部的“困难论”、“悲观论”等错误思想，就不能全面正确地执行党的总路线。于是县委提出了“政治挂帅、大搞群众运动”的口号，并采取了四项措施：
    宣传政策提高觉悟
    总结经验鼓起干劲
    县委委员挂帅，组织报告团十六个，两千余名干部深入社队、厂矿，通过宣传和总结总路线和人民公社的巨大威力，总结建国十年来特别是1958、1959年来的跃进成绩；总结大办水利的好处，宣传今冬明春兴修水利方针、计划；总结执行农业增产“八字宪法”的体会，宣传小麦管理措施；总结大协作大兵团作战的作用，宣传实行“四化”的效果，发动群众展开大鸣大放大辩论。半月中全县共贴出大字报二十四万余张，提出各种意见达四十一万余条。河顺公社和姚村公社南陵阳、郎垒两个大队鲜明不同的两个事例，对大家教育很大：过去人人都说“南陵阳是个好地方，自流水渠灌四方，九年老天不下雨，十年丰收有保障。”但是由于有些领导干部不能正确执行总路线，处处强调“困难”，几年来，粮食增产很少，今年也未完成公社包产合同。和南陵阳大队紧挨的郎垒大队却是另一番景象，自然等条件过去是：“三山四凹九道沟，十年就有九不收，旱涝灾害难抵抗，经常逃荒在外头。”解放后，在党的领导下，这个队生产逐年提高，特别是近几年来，由于干部群众正确地贯彻执行党的各项政策，鼓足干劲，力争上游，今年每亩产量达九百九十四斤，超过公社包产合同。生动的事例使干部社员懂得了只要鼓干劲，跃进无止境。元康公社在总结水利建设成绩中，社员们通过计算八千亩旱地改水地的产量对比账以后，都说：“松劲要不得，干劲需再鼓，还要大搞水利，向水要粮。”社员们决心开渠四十八条，修水库三座，把八千亩山坡梯田彻底实现高山水利化。
    实物展览广开眼界
    参观评比方向明确
    社社举办展览馆，队队建立展览棚。这是干部群众自我教育的好方法。东姚公社部分社员原来对大搞水利劲头不大，说：“山高石多，水源缺，没啥希望。”通过组织参观展览馆，社员们看到几年来全社已有八十多万元的公共积累，有了拖拉机和各种机器十二部，培养了水利技术员一千七百余名。特别是公社化后，各项水利纠纷没有了，劳力、工具、经济、技术又可统一集中使用等等，认为可以大兴水利。党委副书记刘老三又率领五十名群众代表参观了英雄渠工程。社员们看后，情绪更高，说：合涧等公社能从太行山上修成英雄渠，我们从白云山修支渠更没问题。于是全社抽出四千五百名青壮年组成二百五十个突击队，扛工具、抬锅取碗、带被子日夜兼程奔赴到水利工地。
  大插红旗广树标兵
    展开竞赛力争上游
    插红旗、树标兵，进一步促进了争上游、赶先进运动。全县在三秋工作基本结束的基础上，共选出先进公社五个、大队五十七个、小队八百七十二个、小组两千七百二十八个和模范社员五万七千余名。他们又是冬季生产运动的带头人。以往一直是三类地区的姚村公社，今年三秋中一跃而被评为先进单位，周围公社就组织干部社员去参观学习该社经验。城关公社参观后，社员们说：“姚村会变先进，咱也能苦干一冬决心改变面貌。”写出决心书四千七百五十份，七千余名男女劳力要求上山修水利。合涧公社合涧大队九小队被选为模范队后，一小队社员当场提出要以比指标先进、比措施具体、比干劲饱满、比成绩显著为条件，和九队竞赛。全大队迅速掀起了队和队、组和组、人和人的竞赛。
    发扬共产主义精神
    大搞协作互相支援
    通过查任务算劳力，查现金算需要，查物资算库存，查技术算力量，使大家明确了开展大协作的重要性；特别是通过总结几年来开展大协作的成绩，进一步批判了本位思想和右倾情绪。元康、小店、东姚、采桑、城关等八个公社积极提出协作修建弓上水库，使七个公社的五十余万亩土地彻底实现水利化。合涧公社上庄大队通过辩论，社员们说：“去年修水利要不是山地来支援，决不会取得这样大成绩。咱今年一定要帮助地处高山的社员修水利。”在该队的倡导下，全社十四个平地队抽出劳力五百名，和太行山顶上的路家岭队协作开绕山渠一道，建抽水站一个，修水库一个，使路家岭队一千四百亩土地实现水利化。全县开展协作的有十四个公社，一百七十五个大队，三千零七十个小队，六千八百二十个小组，共协作劳力四万余名，工具七万余件，资金百余万元，技术人员一千八百余人。由于互相协作支援，就克服了生产运动中的各种困难，使冬季生产高潮一浪高一浪地向前推进。
