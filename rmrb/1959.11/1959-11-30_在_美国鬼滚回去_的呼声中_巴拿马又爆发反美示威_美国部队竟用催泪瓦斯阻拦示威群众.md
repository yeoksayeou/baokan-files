Xinhua News Agency, November 29th: Panama City dispatch: The Panamanian people once again held a vigorous anti-American demonstration on the 28th, resolutely demanding the recovery of the Panama Canal occupied by the Americans.

November 28th was the 136th anniversary of Panama's independence from Spanish rule. On this day, a commemorative meeting with 6,000 participants was held in the capital of Panama. Speakers at the meeting unanimously condemned the aggressive policies of the United States. Prior to the meeting, hundreds of Panamanians waving Panamanian flags and blowing horns, rode in large trucks and sedans through the Canal Zone in a "march for sovereignty." As they entered the city to attend the meeting, they distributed large numbers of leaflets calling for the abolition of the 1903 treaty that permanently leased the Canal Zone to the Americans.

After the meeting, the demonstrators, holding placards with slogans such as "Down with imperialist aggression" and shouting slogans such as "Yankee go home," marched toward the Canal Zone. However, when the procession reached the border of the Canal Zone, a fierce clash occurred due to fully armed U.S. soldiers using water cannons and tear gas to prevent the masses from entering the Canal Zone. According to United Press International, angered Panamanians retaliated with stones against the U.S. soldiers and forced the Panamanian National Guard, which formed the "first line of defense," to retreat step by step all the way to the Canal Zone. At the same time as the demonstrations, American buildings in Panama City were attacked. These included the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. Information Service, some American stores on Central Avenue, some buildings near the First National City Bank, and the American Telegraph Company.

The American colonialists, frightened by the anti-American wave of anger among the Panamanian people, are taking measures to prevent Panamanians from entering the Canal Zone. It is reported that intersections in the Canal Zone are being closely guarded by U.S. soldiers with live ammunition, and they have set up barbed wire at the entrance to the Canal Zone as if facing a formidable enemy, and have set up machine guns facing the streets of Panama City. The U.S. military command has ordered Americans to stay out of Panama City.

    在“美国鬼滚回去”的呼声中
    巴拿马又爆发反美示威
    美国部队竟用催泪瓦斯阻拦示威群众
    新华社29日讯　巴拿马城消息：巴拿马人民28日再次举行了声势猛烈的反美示威游行，坚决要求收复被美国人占领的巴拿马运河。
    11月28日是巴拿马从西班牙统治下获得独立的第一百三十六周年纪念日。这一天下午，在巴拿马首都举行了有六千人参加的纪念大会。在会上讲话的人一致谴责了美国的侵略政策。开会以前，几百名挥舞着巴拿马国旗和吹着号角的巴拿马人，乘着大卡车和小轿车穿过运河区作了一次“争取主权的进军”。当他们进入城市去参加大会时，沿路散发了大量传单，这些传单要求废除1903年签订的关于把运河区永久租让给美国人的条约。
    大会以后，参加示威游行的群众高举写着“打倒帝国主义侵略”的标语牌，高喊着“美国鬼滚回去”等口号，向运河区挺进。但是，在游行队伍走到运河区的边界时，由于全副武装的美国兵用水龙头和催泪瓦斯阻止群众进入运河区而发生了一场激烈的冲突。据合众国际社报道，被激怒的巴拿马人用石头向美国兵还击，并迫使组成“第一道防线”的巴拿马国民警卫队节节后退，一直退到运河特区。在游行示威的同时，巴拿马城中的美国建筑物受到了袭击。其中有美国大使馆、美国新闻处、中央大街的一些美国商店、美国曼哈顿大通银行附近的一些建筑物以及美国电报公司。
    被巴拿马人民的反美怒潮吓坏了的美国殖民主义者，正在采取措施来阻止巴拿马人进入运河区。据报道，运河区的交叉路口正由荷枪实弹的美国兵紧守着，他们如临大敌似的在运河区入口处设立了铁丝网，并且朝着巴拿马市街架起了机关枪。美军司令部已经下令禁止美国人进入巴拿马城。
