Xinhua News Agency, Santiago Electric Dispatch: The First Latin American Women's Congress was held in Santiago from the 19th to the 22nd.

    At the opening ceremony on the 19th, the delegates greeted the Cuban women's delegation entering the venue—the Great Hall of the University of Chile—with warm applause and cheers of "Long Live the Cuban Revolution," while singing the revolutionary songs of the July 26th Movement.

    The first item on the agenda of the congress was "The Problems of Women as Mothers, Workers, and Citizens." The report on this item was given by Uruguayan women's leader and doctor, Selva Ruiz. The speaker cited detailed examples illustrating the current situation of women in Latin America. She said that women account for one-third of the labor force, but there is still obvious discrimination in terms of wages, material conditions, and labor conditions. In Brazil, there are two million female workers engaged in handicraft labor, but only 700,000 have wages.

    Selva Ruiz then spoke about the situation of peasant women. He said that the situation of peasant women is worse than that of female workers. She believes that, whether in Uruguay or other Latin American countries, this problem arises from the fact that land is in the hands of landlords. Therefore, she said, the Americas should emulate Cuba and Venezuela, two countries that are carrying out land reform.

    He said that there is also discrimination in terms of women's civil rights. Taking Uruguay as an example, women do not have the right to vote. Generally speaking, in other countries, women face many obstacles in holding leadership positions.

    The first plenary session decided that the chairmanship would be held in rotation by delegations from various countries.

    The First Latin American Women's Congress continued its plenary session on the 20th, listening to speeches by delegates from various countries.

    Dominican representative Neda Estevez spoke about the situation of women in the Dominican Republic, condemning the Trujillo dictatorship for persecuting Dominican women and calling on the entire continent to support the struggle to liberate the Dominican people. The congress responded to her speech with warm applause.

    Puerto Rican representative Laura Albizu Campos condemned the United States for committing the crime of genocide in Puerto Rico. She said that three out of every five women aged twenty to thirty in Puerto Rico are unable to conceive and give birth. She also condemned the United States for implementing compulsory military service in Puerto Rico.

    Mrs. Albizu suggested that the congress pass the following resolutions: 1. Grant Puerto Rico complete independence; 2. Abolish atomic bases and all foreign military bases on Puerto Rican territory; 3. Release the men and women arrested for defending Puerto Rican independence.

    Mrs. Eugenie Cotton, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, delivered a congratulatory speech at today's meeting, expressing the Women's International Democratic Federation's congratulations to the women of Latin America.

    The congress welcomed the Soviet delegation invited to participate in the meeting with warm applause.

    At the closing meeting on the 22nd, the congress adopted resolutions on the issues discussed and passed a letter to the women of Latin America.

    The report adopted at the final meeting of the Congress pointed out that the common characteristics of Latin American countries are the large estate system, imperialist rule, single-product economies, and military treaties. These common characteristics affect the 170 million residents of Latin America. Therefore, the congress decided to launch a struggle against imperialism, to recover and defend national wealth, to implement land reform, to expose military treaties, to abolish military bases, and to reduce armaments. The congress discussed the example provided by Cuba and passed a resolution to support the struggle of the Cuban and Venezuelan people to restore democracy and improve living conditions. In addition, Cuba has been recommended as the venue for the next congress.

    在反对帝国主义和争取解放的呼声中
    拉丁美洲召开妇女代表大会
    据新华社圣地亚哥电　拉丁美洲第一次妇女代表大会19日至22日在圣地亚哥举行。
    在19日开幕大会上，代表们以热烈的掌声和“古巴革命万岁”的欢呼声欢迎古巴妇女代表团进入会场——智利大学大礼堂，同时唱起7月26日运动的革命歌曲。
    大会的第一项议程是“作为母亲、劳动者和公民的妇女的问题”。就这项议程作报告的是乌拉圭妇女领袖和医生塞耳瓦·鲁伊斯。报告人详细地举例说明了拉丁美洲妇女的现状。她说，妇女占劳动人口的三分之一，然而，在工资、物质和劳动条件方面却仍然存在着明显的歧视。巴西有二百万从事手工业劳动的女工，但是只有七十万人有工资。
    塞耳瓦·鲁伊斯接着谈到了农民妇女的情况。他说，农民妇女的情况比女工还要坏。她认为，无论是在乌拉圭还是在拉丁美洲其他国家，这个问题都是由于土地掌握在地主手里而产生的。她说，因此，美洲应该仿效古巴和委内瑞拉，这两个国家正在进行土地改革。
    他说，在妇女的公民权方面也存在着歧视。以乌拉圭为例，妇女没有选举权。一般说来，在其他国家中，妇女担任领导职务受到重重阻挠。
    第一次全体会议上决定，主席由各国代表团轮流担任。
    拉丁美洲第一次妇女代表大会20日继续举行全体会议，听取各国代表的发言。
    多米尼加代表内达·埃斯特维斯作了关于多米尼加妇女处境的发言，她谴责特鲁希略独裁政权迫害多米尼加妇女，呼吁整个大陆支援解放多米尼加人民的斗争。大会对她的发言报以热烈的掌声。
    波多黎各代表劳拉·阿耳维苏·坎波斯谴责美国在波多黎各犯下了消灭种族的罪行。她说，波多黎各每五个二十至三十岁的妇女有三个人不能怀孕生育。她还谴责美国在波多黎各实行强迫兵役制。
    阿耳维苏夫人建议大会通过下列决议：一、让波多黎各完全独立；二、取消波多黎各领土上的原子基地和一切外国军事基地；三、释放为保卫波多黎各独立而被捕的男女。
    国际民主妇女联合会主席欧仁妮·戈登夫人在今天的会议上致祝词，她代表国际民主妇女联合会表示对拉丁美洲妇女的祝贺。
    大会以热烈的掌声欢迎应邀参加会议的苏联代表团。
    在22日闭幕会议上，大会就所讨论的各项问题通过了决议，并通过告拉丁美洲妇女书。
    在代表大会最后一次会议上通过的报告指出，拉丁美洲各国共同的特点是，大庄园制度，帝国主义统治，单一生产和军事条约。这些共同特点影响着全拉丁美洲一亿七千万居民。因此，大会决定为反对帝国主义，收回和保卫国家财富，为实行土地改革，揭露军事条约，撤消军事基地和裁减军备而展开斗争。大会讨论了古巴所提供的榜样，并通过决议声援古巴和委内瑞拉人民为恢复民主和改善生活条件而进行的斗争。此外，古巴已被推荐作为下次大会的会址。
