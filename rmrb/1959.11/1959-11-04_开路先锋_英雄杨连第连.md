    Trailblazer – Hero Yang Liandi Company
    Fighting at the Forefront of Railway Construction
    The "Yang Liandi Company" is one of the heroic companies of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Railway Corps, and a comprehensive model company in the Great Leap Forward. It has not only made outstanding contributions to the construction of railways in the motherland, but is also a "one specialty, multiple skills technology company," a "cultural vanguard company," and a "hygiene pacesetter company." It has won more than one hundred banners and award flags, marking the immortal achievements this heroic company has made for the people of the motherland.
    Ten years ago, when our motherland was still in the midst of war, the hero Yang Liandi, with extraordinary courage, climbed the natural barrier of the Longhai Railway – the Eighth Bridge. On a forty-five-meter-high single-sided ladder, he completed an emergency repair task, supporting the victorious advance of the field army, and was therefore awarded the title of "Climbing Hero." His company also received the first red flag of "Overcoming Difficulties, Repair Pioneer." Over the past ten years, the officers and soldiers of the "Yang Liandi Company" have marched forward, holding high the red flag of the hero, fighting at the forefront of railway construction in the motherland, building thirty-nine bridges, and becoming a heroic trailblazer for the people of the motherland.
    The "Yang Liandi Company" is a fighting collective condensed by a high degree of revolutionary heroism. Every soldier loves the honor of the company and regards the task of building roads and bridges entrusted to them by the people of the motherland as the greatest glory. In 1954, they conquered quicksand for the first time in the Lizhan Railway project and built the Shizui Bridge. Immediately afterwards, in the "mountain-moving and sea-reclaiming" Yingxia Railway project, they erected the Shaxikou Bridge, and conquered the turbulent Minjiang River, building a large iron bridge spanning five hundred meters across the north and south banks, twenty-three meters above the water surface, with thirteen spans, one of which could accommodate ships, ahead of schedule. This made an outstanding contribution to the great project of completing the Yingxia Railway one year ahead of schedule. At the same time and soon afterwards, the "Yang Liandi Company" also dispatched some of its technical force to participate in the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and the Sanshenggong Bridge on the Baolan Railway. Full of enthusiasm, they created miracles on the Yangtze River and the Yellow River with the people of the motherland.
    In the spring of 1958, the year of the nationwide Great Leap Forward, the "Yang Liandi Company" transferred from the coast of the East China Sea to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and invested in the construction of the Kun (Ming) - Yi (Pinglang) Railway. This one-hundred-and-twenty-five-kilometer line traverses continuous mountains, with treacherous terrain and steep slopes and high bridges. Nineteen years ago, the reactionary and corrupt Kuomintang government had tried to build this road without success. Today, the soldiers of the "Yang Liandi Company" are standing alone, "contracting" the construction of twenty-eight high bridges and the repair and reconstruction of forty-five bridge culverts on the entire line.
    Everyone is a Multi-Skilled Hand
    For ten years, although the "Yang Liandi Company" has been famous for climbing and building bridges, the entire company has always concentrated on one construction site. One platoon was only responsible for one fixed technical specialty, and could not complete the task independently without the cooperation of other types of work. Now, the situation is pressing, and one platoon or even one squad must stand alone. Otherwise, it would be impossible for one company to complete so many complex and dispersed tasks within the time specified by the superiors.
    The CPC company branch called on all officers and soldiers of the company: to vigorously engage in technical revolution and technical innovation, not to "fight alone", everyone must become a "multi-skilled hand", so that one company can be used as several companies, and make greater contributions to the motherland!
    A vigorous "one specialty, multiple skills" campaign was launched throughout the company. Day and night, they worked and trained simultaneously, the old led the new, and they taught and learned from each other. Under the slogan of "Work first, learn second, research third, and then work again!", the soldiers were full of enthusiasm and concentration. They did not forget to learn technology even during meal and rest times. New recruit Liu Kelong learned to use a diesel pile driver in seven days and became a second-level technical expert. The whole company immediately launched a "catch up with Liu Kelong" campaign, and another new recruit, Wang Quanfu, quickly reached the level of a fourth-level carpenter. After learning carpentry, they learned masonry, and after learning masonry, they learned hoisting... After a month of intensive work, "soldier engineers" and "one specialty, multiple skills technical soldiers" emerged in large numbers. The soldiers in the company generally reached the level of fourth-level technology or above, and generally mastered three or more bridge and culvert construction techniques, which quadrupled or quintupled the company's technical strength, enabling each squad and platoon to stand alone, and improving construction efficiency by 100%.
    Therefore, when the bridge construction project began, with rain and snow, and muddy roads, the leaders were worried that the "Yang Liandi Company's" bridge construction project would not keep up with the track-laying project. However, the soldiers of the "Yang Liandi Company" patted their chests and said: "We are a one specialty, multiple skills technology company, we guarantee that the track will be laid there and the bridge will be built there!" They took off their cotton coats in the rain and snow, and worked in single clothes. Some people disliked that rubber shoes were slippery, so they simply worked barefoot. They fastened steel cables in the high altitude in the cold wind. People sat in buckets under pulleys, went to the bridge piers to tie soft ladders, and then hung the soft ladders down from the bridge piers. People stepped on the soft ladders to go up and down and worked at high altitude. When erecting the beams, they felt that the automatic winch was too slow to pull the steel beams - it took almost half a day to erect one span, so they modified a large bridge erecting machine from a Japanese-style military beam, so that a thirty-three-ton steel beam could be erected in only fifteen minutes, and a ten-ton steel beam could be erected in five minutes. As a result, they completed all the bridge and culvert projects two months ahead of schedule, enabling the Kunyi Railway, which was urgently needed to support Yunnan's economic construction's Great Leap Forward, to be officially opened to traffic this year on "July 1". The "Yang Liandi Company" was rated as an advanced unit in Yunnan Province's industrial and transportation systems and won a special prize.
    Racing Against the Flood
    Starting in March, the "Yang Liandi Company," full of honor, fought on the Min-Dian Railway construction site. They worked side by side with brother companies to erect the Miandian Bridge, which was forty-three meters high and more than one hundred and fifty meters long, only two meters shorter than the Eighth Bridge on the Longhai Road that the "Climbing Hero" Yang Liandi climbed in those years. The soldiers had to build bridge piers as high as ten stories deep in the mountain valley and had to build them before the flood arrived.
    It was raining continuously, and the mountains were cold. The Yang Liandi-style soldiers, under the strong leadership of the Party branch, launched a combat competition to "race against the flood." They organized assault teams and jumped into the mud to dig bridge foundations, and ran on steep slopes and muddy roads to transport earth and stone, fearing no difficulties or dangers. "Dig more, carry more, run faster!" A high tide of catching up with each other quickly formed between the various processes. During the pouring of the No. 2 bridge pier, when more than forty soldiers and migrant workers climbed cliffs and transported sand and materials, but the supply could not keep up, the platoon leader and communist party member Liu Jike, who had participated in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and had made great contributions by removing time bombs on the steel transportation line, pondered day and night, boldly created, and, after repeated research and experimentation with everyone, built an aerial cableway from the steep cliff directly to the bottom of the valley, allowing wooden buckets loaded with sand to "fly in the sky" and quickly transport the sand to the bridge pier, and the empty buckets would automatically fly up. In this way, only eight people were needed to fully meet the requirements for transporting and supplying sand and materials, ensuring that the pier construction project would proceed more smoothly and quickly. In the Red May battle, the entire company completed 154% of the project quota, and continued to maintain the high-yield result of "red every month".
    Advance victoriously
    In September, the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party further inspired the soldiers of the "Yang Liandi Company." Their fighting spirit was even more high-spirited, their enthusiasm soared, and they enthusiastically launched a "four-comparison" red flag competition of "comparing high output, comparing high quality, comparing saving, and comparing safety", trying every possible means to build railways for the motherland quickly, well, and economically. The soldiers carried forward the style of daring to think and daring to do, broke through technical barriers, and successively improved and adopted various advanced experiences such as "steel frame pouring concrete," "concrete adding rubble," and "pouring concrete operation method," so that the engineering efficiency leaped again and again, and saved a lot of construction materials such as cement, wood, and iron wire for the country. In the September battle, they completed the task with an overall surplus of 58.9%, dedicating it to the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the country. In October, they took advantage of the victory to forge ahead, striving to "dedicate a greater victory in October than in September to the National Congress of Heroes". As of the 23rd, they had overfulfilled the monthly plan by 116%, and are currently fighting bravely to complete this year's bridge engineering tasks ahead of schedule and in an all-round way.

    开路先锋——英雄杨连第连
    战斗在铁路  建设的前列
    “杨连第连”是中国人民解放军铁道兵部队的英雄连队之一，大跃进中的全面模范连。它不仅在修建祖国铁路中作出了出色的贡献，而且是“一专多能技术连”、“文化尖兵连”和“卫生标兵连”。它荣获了一百多面锦旗和奖旗，标志着这个英雄连队为祖国人民建树的不朽功勋。
    十年前，当我们祖国还处在战火纷飞的时候，英雄杨连第曾以包天之胆，攀上陇海铁路的天险——八号桥，在四十五米高的单面云梯上，完成了紧急抢修任务，支援野战大军胜利挺进，因而荣获“登高英雄”的称号。他的连队，也获得了“战胜困难，抢修先锋”的第一面红旗。十年来，“杨连第连”的官兵们，高举着英雄的红旗前进，一直战斗在祖国铁路建设的最前列，架设桥梁三十九座，成为祖国人民的一支英勇的开路先锋。
    “杨连第连”是一个高度革命英雄主义精神凝结成的战斗集体。每一个战士都热爱连队的荣誉，把祖国人民交给自己的筑路架桥任务，看成是最大的光荣。1954年，他们首次在黎湛铁路工程中征服了流沙，筑起石咀大桥。紧接着，又在“移山填海的鹰厦铁路工程中，架起沙溪口大桥，并且征服了惊涛浊流的闽江，在横跨南北两岸五百米的江流上，入水、登高，提前建成了高出水面二十三米、共十三孔、中间一孔还能跑轮船的大铁桥，为提前一年修通鹰厦铁路的伟大工程，作出优异贡献。在这同时和后来不久，“杨连第连”又分别抽出了一部分技术力量，参加了武汉长江大桥和包兰铁路三盛公大桥的工程，他们满怀激情，同祖国人民一道，在长江和黄河天险上创造了奇迹。
    全国大跃进的1958年春天，“杨连第连”从东海之滨，转战云贵高原，投入了昆（明）一（平浪）铁路的修建工程。这条一百二十五公里的线路，横穿连绵不断的山脉，地势险恶，路陡桥高。十九年前，反动腐败的国民党政府曾修过这条路，一事无成。今天，“杨连第连”的战士们却独挡一面，“包干”了全线二十八座高桥的建设和四十五座桥涵的修复和重建任务。
    人人都是多面手
    十年来，“杨连第连”虽然素以登高架桥而闻名，但却都是全连集中在一个现场上施工，一个排只担负一种固定的技术专业，离开其他工种配合，便不能单独完成任务。现在，形势逼人，必须一个排甚至一个班的兵力去独挡一面。不然，在上级规定的时间内，一个连要完成这么多工种复杂、工点分散的任务，是万万办不到的。
    中共连支部号召全连官兵：大闹技术革命和技术革新，不要“单打一”，人人要成为“多面手”，使一个连顶几个连队用，为祖国作出更大的贡献！
    轰轰烈烈的“一专多能”运动在全连展开了。日日夜夜，边施工边训练，以老带新，互教互学。在“一干，二学，三研究，四再干！”的口号下，战士们意气风发，全神贯注，连吃饭、休息的时间都不忘记学技术。新战士刘克龙七天学会了使用柴油打桩机，成为二级技术能手；全连马上开展了“赶刘克龙”运动，又一个新战士王全福，很快达到了四级木工的水平。学会了木工学砌工，学会了砌工又学起重……全连大战一个月，“战士工程师”和“一专多能技术兵”大量涌现，全连战士普遍达到四级技术以上水平，普遍掌握了三种以上的修建桥涵技术，这就使连队的技术力量猛增四倍至五倍，各个班、排都能独挡一面，施工效率提高了100％。
    因此，当架桥工程开始，雨雪交加，道路泥泞，领导上都担心“杨连第连”的架桥工程赶不上铺轨工程时，“杨连第连”的战士们却一拍胸膛说：“我们是一专多能技术连，保证轨铺到那里，桥架在那里！”他们在雨雪中脱下棉衣，穿单衣干，有人嫌胶鞋打滑，干脆赤脚干。他们在寒风凛冽的高空拴起钢索，人坐在滑车下面的斗子里，上到桥墩绑软梯，然后再把软梯从桥墩上吊下来，人就踩着软梯上上下下，在高空作业。架梁的时候，他们嫌自动卷扬机牵着钢梁太慢了——差不多半天才能架一孔，就自己用日式军用梁改制一台大型架桥机，使三十三吨重的钢梁，只十五分钟就可架一孔，十吨重的，五分钟就可架一孔，结果提前两个月完成了全部桥涵工程，使支援云南经济建设大跃进迫切需要的昆一铁路，提前在今年“七一”正式通车。“杨连第连”被评为云南省工业和交通运输系统的先进单位，荣获特等奖。
    和洪水赛跑
    从3月份起，“杨连第连”又满载荣誉，战斗在闽滇大铁路工地上，他们和兄弟连队并肩协作，架设高四十三米、长一百五十多米的面店大桥，比当年“登高英雄”杨连第攀登的陇海路八号桥，只差两米。战士们在深山谷底要筑起十层楼高的桥墩，并且要抢在洪水之先筑好。
    霪雨连绵，高山风寒。杨连第式的战士们，在党支部的坚强领导下，掀起了“和洪水赛跑”的战斗竞赛，纷纷组织突击队，不畏千艰万险，跳进泥潭里挖筑桥基，奔跑在陡坡、泥泞的道路上运土运石。“挖的多，担的多，跑的快！”各工序之间迅速形成了你追我赶的高潮。在灌注二号桥墩，当四十多名战士和民工爬崖走壁，担运砂料供不应求时，曾经参加抗美援朝在钢铁运输线上搬走定时炸弹而荣立大功的排长、共产党员刘继珂，便日夜琢磨，大胆创造，经过同大家反复研究试验，从陡削的山崖直通到谷底，架起一条空中索道，让满载砂料的“天上飞”木斗，把砂料迅速地运到桥墩上，空斗又自动地飞上来。这样，只需要八个人，就完全满足了运输和供应砂料的要求，保证了筑墩工程更顺利更快地进行。红五月大战，全连完成工程定额154％，并且连续保持了“月月红”的高产成绩。
    乘胜前进
    9月份，党的八届八中全会的伟大号召，更加鼓舞着“杨连第连”的战士们，他们的斗志更加昂扬，干劲冲天，热烈展开了“比高产、比优质、比节约、比安全”的“四比”红旗竞赛，千方百计，为祖国多快好省地修建铁路。战士们发扬了敢想敢干的风格，猛闯技术关，先后改进和采用了“钢铁架灌注混凝土”、“混凝土加片石”、“灌注混凝土操作法”等多种先进经验，使工程效率一跃再跃，并且为国家节约了大量的水泥、木料、铁丝等建设器材。9月大战，以全面超额58.9％完成了任务，向伟大的建国十周年献礼。10月份他们乘胜猛进，争取以“10月超9月的更大胜利，献礼全国群英会”，到23日为止，他们已超额完成月计划的116％，目前正在为提前全面超额完成今年的桥梁工程任务而奋勇战斗。
