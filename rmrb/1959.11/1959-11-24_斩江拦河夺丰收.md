　　Cutting the River and Blocking the River to Seize a Bumper Harvest
　　Hongcheng People's Commune, Jianli County, Hubei Province, Dan Wen

　　The Jade Emperor bets hard and won't rain,
　　The Dragon King bets hard and the water stops flowing,
　　The commune bets hard and won't lose its will,
　　Cutting the river and blocking the river to seize a bumper harvest.
　　　　——Jianli folk song

The people of the Guanyin Management District of the Hongcheng People's Commune are now immersed in extreme joy. Our intermediate rice has had a bumper harvest, and the late rice has also had a bumper harvest! This year, the total grain output of the district has more than doubled compared to 1957, and increased by more than 40% compared to 1958. Golden rice fills the fields and granaries, how can we not sing and laugh for this unprecedented bumper harvest!

Bountiful harvests always come from hard work. The crops harvested in the Guanyin Management District are condensed with how many sweat beads of the members! This has to start with the severe drought that occurred this autumn. ... Located in the Jianghan Plain, known as "A knife when it's sunny, a mess when it rains, drums and gongs for three sunny days (pedaling sound), and water up to the eyebrows for three rainy days," the Guanyin Management District of the Hongcheng People's Commune in Jianli County, just as it got rid of the threat of waterlogging, was suddenly attacked by a severe drought. Ponds and weirs dried up, and small rivers stopped flowing. Three of the six large lakes in the district that rely on water for irrigation have dried up, and the water in the other three lakes has also fallen into the heart of the lakes, and the struggle against drought has entered an even more difficult situation!

This year, the management district planted a lot of intermediate rice and late rice. The late rice was tillering, and the intermediate rice was already budding and spitting ears, but a drought occurred at this critical juncture! The fields were densely cracked with large openings more than an inch wide, and the rice seedlings were exposed to the scorching sun, their leaves curled and yellowed. However, the county meteorological station's forecast for the future weather was still: sunny. How anxious people were!

At this time, a middle-aged man with a short stature, a thin face, and piercing eyes was walking back and forth between Jimingpu, Changdiwei, and Shiluowei, either working with the commune members to pump water and dig wells while asking questions, or discussing with several cadres and old farmers, surveying water sources everywhere, and planning the next steps for drought resistance. He is Zhu Shirong, a special-class agricultural labor model in Hubei Province and secretary of the Hongcheng People's Commune Party Committee. One day, Zhu Shirong stopped suddenly next to a big-character poster column at a construction site. One of the big-character posters caught his attention:

　　People engage in the Great Leap Forward, the sky makes things difficult,
　　Not bowing to drought is not a good man,
　　Suggest the branch move big water,
　　No rain in autumn to ensure high yield.

He quickly took out a small notebook from his pocket and wrote down the poem, word for word. "Moving big water" is a good idea! For the more than 38,000 mu of intermediate rice and late rice in the district, drawing spring water alone is limited. The next step in the fight against drought should be focused on "moving big water"!

When Zhu Shirong returned to the management district from the commune meeting, it was already past eleven o'clock. He didn't have time to shower and wipe off his sweat, and after hurriedly discussing with several general branch members, he called a meeting.

About an hour later, the courtyard behind the management district became lively again. Party branch secretaries and production team leaders walked in one by one under the starry sky. Some used straw hats as fans to fan themselves, and some wiped sweat with towels.

"Comrades! Now the drought is getting more and more serious. Although the early rice had a bumper harvest, the area of intermediate rice and late rice is large, and the yield is high. As the saying goes: 'The mouse drags the gourd, the big head is still behind!' Now, the most important task before us is to resolutely overcome the drought and seize a bumper harvest in autumn."

"Water! Water! Water..." Someone sighed.

"I have good news for everyone. The Yangtze River water released from the Ximenyuan Sluice a few days ago filled the Xiliu River yesterday. The commune party committee instructed us to prepare to welcome the Yangtze River water. Our only way is to block the river and build a dam, raise the water level, and cleverly divert the Yangtze River water to achieve self-flowing irrigation. The general branch has studied it and plans to build a dam at Xihuzui to cut off the flow as the first step, and to cut off the flow and build a dam at Jimingpu as the second step. The entire project will be completed in five days. What do comrades think?"

At this time, the meeting place became active.

"The commune members are pumping and digging day and night, and they are very motivated, and they all have the desire to move big water. As long as we rely on the masses and strengthen leadership, we can definitely complete the task of building the dam," said Comrade Zeng Dehong, the second secretary of the party general branch.

"Blocking the river and building a dam is good, but there are many difficulties. Not to mention five days, even one or two months, we can't even think about completing the task!" Someone raised an objection.

"The people's commune has a large population and great strength, and there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. In the past, building a sluice on the main dike of the Yangtze River was unimaginable; our commune has been established for less than a year, and with the cooperation of brother communes, it only took more than a month to build a two-hole flood gate made of steel and concrete. Since we can cut the Yangtze River, can't we block the river?" Comrade Zhu Shirong's words were strong and powerful, encouraging everyone's hearts.

The good news of building dams and blocking the river spread like a gust of wind to every production team in the district. The next day, the commune transferred a large number of tools and equipment from various management districts, and more than 120 skilled workers were drawn from the commune's directly affiliated iron and wood, kiln, and other units to cooperate with this management district.

At the crack of dawn, the vanguard team organized by 110 strong laborers from the Heping Production Team happily set off for the Xihuzui construction site. A fierce battle to block the river and build a dam began.

Red flags fluttered and songs echoed at the construction site; those who dug the soil swung their hoes, and those who carried the soil shuttled back and forth. Slowly, a ridge grew from the ground and gradually rose; however, by the evening, just as the dam was about to close, it quickly collapsed. People hurriedly called the management district to report the emergency. Disaster relief is like putting out a fire, if it doesn't close one day later, how much grain will be lost!

Zeng Dehong immediately led 156 migrant workers to the destination quickly. When the members of the Heping Production Team saw the arrival of reinforcements, they reorganized their forces and fought bravely.

Loose soil could not block the rapid current, so Comrade Zeng Dehong directed the migrant workers to dig grass and soil clods; if grass and soil clods could not block it, they wrapped soil in grass bags. More than 200 migrant workers, each like a fierce tiger just down the mountain, fought hard, and the dam of 2,600 cubic meters of soil cut off Xihuzui. This river-blocking dam, eleven feet high, blocked the water five feet high, and solved the water source for more than 7,000 mu of fields in one fell swoop.

The first battle ended victoriously, and the morale of the commune members was even stronger. The party general branch began to organize the second battle of blocking the river and building a dam at Jimingpu.

Speaking of the Jimingpu damming project, in the past, no one wasn't "scared at the mere mention of it." The Qianli River has a fierce current, and without any technical equipment, it is easy to talk of using human hands to dam a stagnant water! People still remember that in the winter of 1957, the water was smaller than this year, and six or seven hundred people fought for more than a month. Forty or fifty fir strips with a circumference of two feet were cut off inch by inch by the water, and in the end, they only ended up with "sighing at the water." Before communization in 1958, they fought hard for seven days and seven nights, and almost lost several lives, but they couldn't close it. Now, people are going to fight with water again!

Early in the morning, the damming project began, and Zhu Shirong and Zeng Dehong and other comrades were the first to arrive at the construction site. Before long, the construction site was full of people. People dug, carried, and worked non-stop. The soil and grass bags flew like swallows, and the shouts shook the sky. Under the leadership of Comrade Zhu Shirong, a canteen was set up at the construction site, shade sheds were built; children were organized to deliver tea; the medical team bought a large number of heatstroke prevention medicines; in addition, it was stipulated that commune members should rest for three hours at noon and take turns to rest at night. The living arrangements for the migrant workers were well arranged, and their enthusiasm was like a flame that was burning, the more it burned, the stronger it became, and the work efficiency was also higher.

By the morning of the next day, the dam was getting higher and higher, and the mouth was getting smaller and smaller. The turbulent water, with a flow rate of eleven per second, carried weeds and rushed towards the newly built earth dam. Under this continuous impact, chunks of soil collapsed with a crash. ...

In a moment of extreme urgency, the youth commando team composed of Communist Youth League members Shi Minghai, Ping Zhongfa, and others bravely jumped into the water. They were familiar with the water, and quickly hugged the fir strips more than three feet long, shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, and built a human wall to block the rapid current. People immediately lowered piles and filled the soil to block the breach.

At five o'clock that afternoon, a river-blocking dam 150 meters long, four meters high, and blocking more than two meters of water was built. The Qianli River was forced to flow back ninety miles within the scope of the Hongcheng Commune. Not only was the water source in the Guanyin Management District completely solved, but also 110,000 mu of farmland in the three communes of Wangqiao, Yubu, and Maoshi were supplied with water. Among them, 32,000 mu achieved self-flowing irrigation; and more than 40,000 mu changed from multi-chain water pumps to single-chain water pumps. The damming was a victory. The Yangtze River water introduced from the Ximenyuan Flood Gate and the water from the Liu River converged together. The commune members were all beaming with joy. Li Zhaozhang, a commune member in his sixties, flashing tears of joy, said excitedly: "The people's commune is really tough, and it has done things that have never been seen since the beginning of the world."

Zhu Shirong didn't feel sleepy at all. He stood on the river bank, watching the rolling water, silently in a daze: "If the grain is not in hand for a day, it means that the responsibility has not been fulfilled for a day."

For two consecutive days, only three of the six weirs in the district were opened, and the water galloped like wild horses. The rice fields, which were dry and cracked with large mouths, drank greedily, and soon more than 28,000 mu of intermediate rice and late rice fields flowed into the sweet water. Zhu Shirong and Wang Desong, deputy director of the management district, went deep into each production team to check, and found that most of the fields that could not achieve self-flowing irrigation could be lifted with one or two chain water pumps, but the Tongfu Production Team felt it was difficult with more than 600 mu of high-lying land; in addition, the low-lying fields of more than 200 mu in the Hongqi Production Team suffered from waterlogging.

According to the new situation found in the inspection, the party general branch, after collective research, set up a "Longmen Formation": opening inner ditches to divert water, building dams to separate water, clearing boundaries to block leaks, and saving water. The district successively organized more than 1,000 male and female commune members, opened 174 new ditches, washed 459 old ditches, built 169 dams, made more than 450 small streams, and dug 11 dike holes in three days. In this way, the introduced Yangtze River water and river water obediently served the rice seedlings. It not only prevented the low-lying fields from being waterlogged, but also ensured the low water irrigation of the high-lying fields. The drought demon was trapped in the "Longmen Formation" and surrendered obediently.

In the days of harvest, the commune members, measuring the rice stalks that were more than three feet long, counting the wolf tail-like ears of grain, happily waved their sickles, and thanked the leadership of the Party from the bottom of their hearts, and praised "The People's Commune is Good" in unison. They were determined to show their fiery feelings with practical actions. This year, the district should sell 11 million catties of surplus grain, and now it has sold 15.08 million catties. They plan to sell an additional 5 million catties of surplus grain on the basis of overfulfilling the task of selling surplus grain.

A commune member named Jiang Shangguang in the Construction Production Team composed four folk songs for this major event. Although the folk songs are short, they express the common feelings of the commune members:

Following the Party, we are bold,
Not afraid of the sky raining fire,
The river meets, the commune is the master,
Leading the Dragon King as a servant.

    斩江拦河夺丰收
    湖北监利县红城人民公社　丹文
      玉皇赌狠不下雨，
      龙王赌狠水断流，
      公社赌狠不输志，
      斩江拦河夺丰收。
          ——监利民谣
    红城人民公社观音管理区的人们，现在正沉浸在极度的喜悦里。我们的中稻丰收了，晚稻又丰收了！今年全区粮食总产量比1957年翻了一倍多，比1958年增加了40％以上。金色的稻谷满场满仓，我们怎能不为这空前的丰收歌唱、欢笑！
    丰盛的收获总是经过辛苦的耕耘得来的。观音管理区收得的庄稼里，凝结着社员们多少汗珠！这得从今年秋天发生的大旱谈起。……    地处江汉平原，被称为“天晴一把刀，下雨一团糟，晴三天锣鼓喧天（踏车声），下三天淹齐眉尖”的监利县红城人民公社观音管理区，刚摆脱渍灾的威胁，又遭到恶旱猛扑。塘堰干涸，小河断流。全区赖以取水灌溉的六个大湖，枯了三个，另外三个湖水也已经跌入湖心，抗旱斗争进入更加困难的境地了！
    管理区今年栽的中稻和晚稻多，晚稻正在分蘖，中稻已含苞吐穗，可偏在这节骨眼上发生了旱灾！田里密密麻麻的裂开了一寸多宽的大口子，禾苗被烈日曝晒得叶儿卷了、黄了。可是县气象站对未来天气的预报，却还是：晴。人们多心焦啊！
    就在这个时候，一个矮小身材、脸盘消瘦、两眼炯炯有神的中年人，来回在鸡鸣铺、长堤垸、石螺垸之间，不是和社员们一道边车水、挖井，边问这问哪，就是和几个干部、老农在一起，四处勘查水源，筹划着下一步抗旱的作法。他就是湖北省农业特等劳动模范、红城人民公社党委书记朱诗荣。一天，朱诗荣走到一个工地大字报栏旁突然停下了，其中一张大字报引起他的注意：
    人搞跃进天作难，
    旱不低头非好汉，
    建议支部搬大水，
    一秋无雨保丰产。
    他连忙从自己的衣袋里，掏出小笔记本，一字不漏地记下了这首诗。“搬大水”，这是个好办法！对全区三万八千多亩中稻和晚稻来说，光引泉水是有限的。下一步抗旱的文章，应该做在“搬大水”上！
    朱诗荣从公社开完会，回到管理区时，已是十一点多钟了。他来不及洗澡抹汗，匆匆地和几位总支委员研究后，就召集人开会。
    约莫过了一个时辰，管理区后面院子里又热闹起来了。党分支书记和生产队长，一个个从满天星光下走进来。有的用草帽当蒲扇在扇风，有的用汗巾抹着汗。
      “同志们！现在干旱越来越严重，早稻虽然丰收了，但是中稻和晚稻的面积大，产量高。俗话说得好：‘老鼠拖葫芦，大头还在后面哩！’现在，摆在我们面前的头等重要任务，就是要坚决战胜干旱，夺取秋季大丰收。”
    “水！水！水……”不知谁叹息了一声。
    “告诉大家一个好消息，西门渊闸前几天开闸放的长江水，昨天已灌满了西流河。公社党委指示我们，要作好迎接江水的准备。我们唯一的办法，就是拦河筑垱，抬高水位，巧引江水，实现自流灌溉。总支研究了一下，计划在西湖嘴筑垱截流为第一步，鸡鸣铺截流打坝为第二步，全部工程五天完成。同志们看行不行？”
    这时，会场活跃起来。
    “社员们日夜车呀，挖呀，干劲很足，并且都有搬大水的要求，只要我们依靠群众，加强领导，一定可以完成筑垱打坝任务。”党总支第二书记曾德洪同志说。
    “拦河筑垱好是好，就是困难多，莫说五天，就是一月、两月也莫想完成任务啊！”有人提出了异议。
    “人民公社人多力量大，没有克服不了的困难。过去，在长江干堤建闸是不能想像的事；我们公社建社不到一年，在兄弟公社的协作下，只花了一个多月的时间，就建成了钢骨水泥的两孔进洪闸。我们既然能够斩江，难道不能拦河么？”朱诗荣同志的话，坚强有力，鼓舞着每一个人的心。
    筑垱和打坝，斩江又拦河的喜讯，像一阵风一样，很快就传遍了全区每一个生产队。第二天，公社从各管理区调来了大批的工具器材，并由公社直属的铁木、窑厂等单位抽出了一百二十多名技术工人，前来这个管理区协作。
    天麻麻亮，由和平生产队的一百一十个精壮劳力所组织的先头部队，个个兴高采烈的开赴西湖嘴工地。一场激烈的拦河筑垱的战斗展开了。
    工地上红旗招展，歌声嘹亮；挖土的人挥舞着锄头，挑土的人穿梭般地来往。慢慢地从平地上长起一道岭，逐渐升高；可是，到傍晚时分，坝刚一合拢，很快就倒了垱。人们急忙向管理区挂电话告急。救灾如救火，迟一天不合拢，该要损失多少粮食啊！
    曾德洪立即带领了一百五十六个民工，飞快地赶到目的地。和平生产队的社员看到援军到来，便重整旗鼓，奋勇作战。
    散土堵不住急流，曾德洪同志就指挥民工挖草土垡子；草土垡子又堵不住，就包土茅包。两百多个民工，个个像刚下山的猛虎，苦战一场，两千六百公方土的大垱，就腰斩了西湖嘴。这条一丈一尺高的拦河垱，堵水五尺高，一举解决了七千多亩田的水源。
    第一个战役胜利结束了，社员士气更加旺盛，党总支又开始组织鸡鸣铺截流打坝的第二个战役。
    提起鸡鸣铺截流打坝的工程，要在过去，没有一个不是“谈虎色变”的。千里流河，水势凶猛，毫无技术设备，凭人的双手去打坝死水，谈何容易！人们还记得，1957年冬天，水比今年小，六、七百人打了一个多月，四、五十根两尺合围的杉木条，被水冲得寸寸切断，结果只落得一个“望水兴叹”；1958年公社化前，苦战过七天七夜，差一点丢掉几条人命，也没法使它合拢。现在，人们要再次跟水搏斗了！
    清晨，打坝工程开始，朱诗荣和曾德洪等同志第一批来到了工地。不多时，工地就布满了人。人们挖呀，挑呀，忙个不停，土茅包像燕子飞转，吆嗬声震动天地。在朱诗荣同志的领导下，工地办起了食堂，搭起了荫棚；组织了小孩送茶水；医疗队买回大批防暑药品；此外还规定社员中午休息三点钟和夜晚轮班休息。民工的生活安排好了，干劲像燃烧起来的火焰一样，越烧越旺，工效也越高。
    到第二天上午，坝越筑越高，拢口越缩越小，湍水以每秒十一个流量，夹带着乱草向新筑的土坝冲击，在这种连续冲击下，成块的泥土哗啦哗啦地坍了下去。……
    在万分紧急的时刻里，由共青团员石明海、平忠发等十二人组成的青年水手突击队，奋不顾身的跳下水去。他们熟悉水性，很快就抱住三丈多长的杉木条，肩靠肩，手挽桩，筑起了一道人墙，挡住了急流。人们立刻下桩填土，把决口堵住了。
    当天下午五点钟，一条长一百五十米、高四米、堵水两米多的拦河大坝筑成了。千里河水被迫在红城公社的范围内倒流九十里。不仅观音管理区的水源全部得到了解决，而且汪桥、余埠、毛市等三个公社的十一万亩农田也得到了水源。其中有三万二千亩得到自流灌溉；四万多亩由多串车改为了一串车起水。筑垱打坝胜利了。从西门渊进洪闸引进来的江水和流河的水汇合在一起。社员个个喜气盈盈。六十多岁的社员李昭章闪动着欢乐的泪花，很激动地说：“人民公社真有狠，把盘古以来未见到过的事也办到了。”
    朱诗荣没有一点困意。他站在河堤上，望着滚动的流水，正默默地出神：“谷子一天不到手，一天算没尽到责任。”
    接连两天，全区六个剅只开了三个，水像野马奔驰。稻田里干得裂着大大的嘴巴，大口大口的喝着，很快就有两万八千多亩中稻和晚稻田流进了甘水。朱诗荣和管理区副主任王德松深入到各生产队检查，发现不能实现自流灌溉的田，绝大部分田可起一、两串车引水，但同福生产队有六百多亩地势高的田感到困难；另外红旗生产队两百多亩地势低的田却受了渍。
    根据检查发现的新情况，党总支经过集体研究，设下了“龙门阵”：开内沟引水，筑垱隔水，清界筑漏，节约用水。全区先后组织了一千多个男女社员，三天开了一百七十四条新沟，洗了四百五十九条旧沟，筑了一百六十九条垱，做了四百五十多条小涧，挖了十一个堤洞。这样，使引进来的江水和河水，乖乖地为禾苗服务。既防止了低田受渍，又保证了低水灌溉高田。使旱魔陷入“龙门阵”内，俯首就擒了。
    在丰收的日子里，社员们量着三尺多长的稻梗，数着狼尾巴似的谷穗，喜洋洋地挥起了镰刀，从心里感谢党的领导，异口同声赞颂“人民公社好”。他们决心以实际行动来表明他们火热的心情。今年全区应售余粮一千一百万斤，现已出售一千五百零八万斤。他们计划在超额完成出售余粮任务的基础上，再多售余粮五百万斤。
    建设生产队有个社员叫姜尚光，为这场大事编了四句民歌，民歌虽短，却道出社员们的共同心情：
    跟党走胆子大，
    老天下火也不怕，
    江河会师社作主，
    牵着龙王当听差。
