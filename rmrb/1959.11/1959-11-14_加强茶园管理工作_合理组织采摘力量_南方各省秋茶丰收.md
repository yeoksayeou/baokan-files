Xinhua News Agency Report: Southern regions have achieved a bumper harvest of autumn tea. It is expected that the total tea production nationwide will exceed the planned target.

From August to October is the season for harvesting and processing autumn tea in the southern tea-producing areas. This year, thanks to the people's communes in the tea-producing areas strengthening the management of tea gardens, including cultivation, soil enrichment, and topdressing, and the well-organized tea-picking labor force, all regions have achieved bumper harvests of autumn tea. Zhejiang Province realized the slogan of autumn tea production exceeding spring tea. In some tea-producing areas, the autumn tea production reached or exceeded the production of the spring and summer seasons combined. Zhejiang Province, which had good autumn tea production, increased its autumn tea production by 70% compared to last year, and the quality also improved compared to last year. As of October 20, Sheng County in this province had picked more than 68,000 dan of autumn tea, exceeding the spring and summer production by 15.5%. Fujian Province also achieved a bumper harvest of autumn tea, with a 48% increase compared to last year's autumn tea. By the end of October, the province had purchased more than 78,000 dan of autumn tea, exceeding the spring tea production by more than 10%.

During the autumn tea picking period, Party committees at all levels strengthened organizational leadership, mobilizing the people's communes to rationally arrange labor and quickly complete the tea picking tasks. In Zhejiang Province, the daily attendance of the fourteen key tea-producing counties was half as many again than at the peak of spring tea picking. Guizhou Province held several telephone conferences for autumn tea production. The Meitan County Party Committee sent people to three communes to specifically arrange tea-picking labor. The Yichang County Party Committee in Hubei and the Party committees of all communes in the county designated a secretary to be in charge of tea production. Hunan Province mobilized 210,000 people in September to rush to pick tea in the mountains.

While picking and processing autumn tea, the people's communes actively sold it to the state, so the progress of tea purchasing in various regions was also fast. By mid-October, Zhejiang Province had exceeded the annual tea purchase plan by 22.3%, an increase of 13.6% over last year. Fujian Province has overfulfilled its tea purchase plan by 12%. By mid-October, Jiangsu, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hubei, Hunan and other provinces and regions had all overfulfilled the annual purchase plans. Sichuan Province purchased 17.8% more than last year, and Yunnan Province purchased 20.4% more.

At present, most tea-producing areas have closed their gardens and stopped picking, and have switched to winter management and construction work such as tea garden fertilization, frost protection, and expansion of new tea gardens, in preparation for a bumper harvest of spring tea next year.

    加强茶园管理工作　合理组织采摘力量
    南方各省秋茶丰收
    新华社讯　南方各地秋茶丰收。预计全国茶叶的总产量可超额完成计划。
    8月到10月是南方各茶区采制秋茶的季节。今年由于茶区的人民公社加强了对茶园的中耕、培土、追肥等管理工作，采茶劳力也组织得好，因而各地秋茶都获得了丰收。浙江省实现了秋茶产量超春茶的口号。有些茶区的秋茶产量达到或者超过了春、夏两季的产量。秋茶生产较好的浙江省，比去年秋茶增产七成，品质也比去年提高。这个省的嵊县到10月20日已采秋茶六万八千多担，超过春夏两季产量15.5％。福建省秋茶也获得丰收，比去年秋茶增产48％，到10月下旬全省已收购秋茶七万八千多担，超过了春茶产量一成以上。
    在秋茶采摘期间，各地各级党委加强了组织领导工作，动员各人民公社合理安排劳动力，迅速完成采茶任务。浙江省十四个重点产茶县每日出勤人数比春茶采摘盛期还多一半。贵州省为秋茶生产开过好几次电话会议，湄潭县委曾经派人到三个公社具体安排采茶劳力。湖北宜昌县委和全县各公社党委都指定一个书记专管茶叶生产。湖南省9月份动员了二十一万人上山突击采茶。
    各地人民公社一面采制秋茶，一面积极向国家交售，因而各地茶叶收购工作进度也快。到10月中旬，浙江省已超额22.3％完成全年茶叶收购计划，比去年多收13.6％。福建茶叶收购计划已超额12％完成。江苏、贵州、广西、湖北、湖南等省区到10月中旬都已超额完成全年的收购计划。四川省比去年多收购17.8％，云南省多收了20.4％。
    现在，大部分茶区已封园停采，转入茶园施肥、防冻、扩大新茶园等冬季管理、建设工作，为明年春茶丰收作好准备。
