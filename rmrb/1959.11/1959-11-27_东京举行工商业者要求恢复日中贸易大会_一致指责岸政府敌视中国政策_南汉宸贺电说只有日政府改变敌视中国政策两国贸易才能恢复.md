Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 26th: Four hundred representatives from one hundred and forty-one Japanese industrial and commercial groups held a national meeting in Tokyo on the 25th, demanding the immediate resumption of Sino-Japanese trade.

    The conference unanimously adopted a resolution and a declaration.

    The resolution demanded that the Japanese government immediately take measures to restore trade relations with China. The resolution criticized the Kishida Nobusuke government for adopting a so-called "wait-and-see" attitude for a year and a half. However, industrialists and businessmen can no longer tolerate this stalemate. The resolution warned that if the government and the ruling party do not change their policy towards China, they will lose public support.

    The declaration of the conference stated: If the Kishida Nobusuke government dares to stubbornly adhere to its outdated policy, we will unite with people in industry and commerce to oppose the government's policy. The declaration pointed out that the voice of the people of the world yearning for peace is growing louder and louder, and the Japanese people are increasingly eager to establish friendly relations with China.

    Asanuma Inejirō, Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party, and Kazami Akira, Director-General of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, also attended the conference. They both urged industrialists and businessmen to mobilize public opinion to put pressure on the government.

    Industrial and commercial representatives who spoke at the meeting unanimously condemned the government for adopting a hostile policy towards China. They emphasized that trade with socialist countries would bring prosperity to the Japanese economy.

Xinhua News Agency, November 25th: Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, sent a telegram to the National Conference of Japanese Industrialists and Businessmen Demanding Immediate Restoration of Sino-Japanese Trade on the 23rd, warmly congratulating the convening of the conference.

    The congratulatory telegram stated: "Promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and developing trade between the two countries is the common desire of the people of both countries. However, due to the Japanese Kishida Nobusuke government's implementation of a policy hostile to China, the relations between the two countries are in an abnormal state, and the already developed Sino-Japanese trade has been completely destroyed and has not yet been restored."

    The congratulatory telegram stated: "Recently, the Kishida Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards China has become increasingly intensified. It has openly stated that the revised U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' aimed at strengthening the U.S.-Japan military alliance, has an operational scope that 'includes areas around Japan such as north of the Philippines, the coast of China, and the Maritime Territory.' There is no doubt that its spearhead is aimed at the Soviet Union and China. The Chinese people cannot but express their great indignation at Kishida Nobusuke's arrogant conspiracy to prepare for a war of aggression. We believe that Sino-Japanese trade relations can only be restored if the Kishida Nobusuke government changes its criminal policy of hostility towards China, does not participate in the conspiracy to create 'two Chinas,' and does not obstruct the restoration of normal relations between the two countries."

    The congratulatory telegram stated: "We express our sincere support for the efforts made by the broad masses of the Japanese people and people in the industrial and commercial sectors to change this situation. We wish the conference success."

    东京举行工商业者要求恢复日中贸易大会
    一致指责岸政府敌视中国政策
    南汉宸贺电说只有日政府改变敌视中国政策两国贸易才能恢复
    据新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本一百四十一个工商团体的四百名代表25日在东京举行全国工商业者要求立即恢复日中贸易大会。
    大会一致通过了决议和宣言。
    决议要求日本政府立即采取措施恢复同中国的贸易关系。决议指责岸信介政府一年半以来一直采取所谓“静观”的态度。但是，工商业者再也不能容忍这种僵局了。决议警告说，如果政府和执政党不改变它们的对中国的政策，它们一定会失去公众的支持。
    大会的宣言表示：如果岸信介政府胆敢顽固地坚持已经过时的政策，我们将同工商界人士联合起来反对政府的政策。宣言指出，世界各国人民渴望和平的呼声愈来愈响亮，日本人民日益渴望同中国建立友好关系。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎和恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章也出席了大会。他们都要求工商业者发动舆论向政府施加压力。
    在会上发言的工商业代表一致指责政府对中国采取敌视政策。他们强调指出，同社会主义国家进行贸易将使日本经济繁荣。
    新华社25日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸在23日打电报给日本全国工商业者要求立即恢复日中贸易大会，热烈祝贺大会的召开。
    贺电说：“促进中日友好、发展两国贸易是两国人民的共同愿望。但是，由于日本岸信介政府执行敌视中国的政策，使两国关系处于不正常状态，已经发展起来的中日贸易遭到了彻底的破坏，至今未能恢复”。
    贺电说：“最近，岸信介政府敌视中国的政策，越来越变本加厉。它公然表示，以加强日美两国军事同盟为目的修改后的日美‘安全条约’作战范围‘包括菲律宾以北、中国沿岸、滨海边区等日本周围地区。’毫无疑问，其矛头是指向苏联和中国。中国人民对于岸信介这种狂妄的准备侵略战争的阴谋，不能不表示极大的愤慨。我们认为只有岸信介政府改变敌视中国的罪恶政策，不参与制造‘两个中国’的阴谋，不阻挠两国正常关系的恢复，中日贸易关系才能恢复。”
    贺电说：“我们对于日本广大人民和工商界人士为改变这种情况所作的努力表示衷心的支持。预祝大会成功。”
