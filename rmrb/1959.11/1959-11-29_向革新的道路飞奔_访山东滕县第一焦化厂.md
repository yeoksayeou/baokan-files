    Racing on the Road to Innovation
    ——A Visit to the No. 1 Coking Plant in Teng County, Shandong
    By our correspondents Che Lin and Bi Wanzhao
    When you take the Jinpu Railway train through the Zao-Tao area of Shandong, just peek out of the train window, and groups of chimneys and coke ovens will immediately catch your eye. This is the nationally famous No. 1 Coking Plant in Teng County, Shandong.

    In 1956, the workers here who were involved in coking began to extract tar from coal gas and process it into petroleum products such as kerosene, diesel, gasoline, and crude phenol. In the first ten months of this year, they produced more than 300 tons of diesel and gasoline and successfully trial-produced more than 40 products such as industrial lubricating oil, anti-corrosion oil, paraffin wax, solvent oil, and ammonium sulfate. The recovery rate of tar increased to more than 1%, and the output of various petroleum products increased by three to five times compared with last year.
                  
                  Getting Started with Indigenous Methods
    Judging from the products, you might think that this factory has many modern pieces of equipment and is a factory of considerable scale! However, eight years ago, there were only eighteen workers and seven old and backward open-flame coking pools. Now, in addition to several newly built coke ovens, most of the production is still done using old-fashioned coking pools.

    "Start with indigenous methods first, then gradually improve." They have a very deep understanding of this. One day in 1956, Fan Zongmo, the head of the production technology section who came from a working-class background, saw a news item in the newspaper about recovering tar from coal gas. He realized that he didn't know how much tar was being wasted in his own factory's coking process, so he decided to recover the tar. He put forward his idea and immediately received the support of the leadership. With the assistance of old worker Li Chengxin, he built oil channels in the kiln and inserted a galvanized iron pipe to replace the condenser, and began the oil extraction experiment. Tar was extracted, and thirty kilograms were collected from a thirty-ton capacity kiln. At this time, they discovered that the Kailuan-style sealed coke ovens used in other areas produced more tar than they did. However, building such a new furnace would require 50,000 blue bricks and cost 500 yuan. In order to save expenses, they boldly used adobe bricks instead of blue bricks and built a batch of Kailuan-style coke ovens. From then on, the amount of tar recovered per furnace rapidly increased to 180 kilograms, and the output increased fivefold. In this way, an old and backward indigenous coking plant was transformed into a factory that produced both coke and oil.

                  Gradually Improving
    Now that oil has been extracted using indigenous methods, can we squeeze it a little more and produce a little more? This thought immediately came to the workers' minds. One day, worker Zhang Shengliang was standing in front of the coke oven watching the flames when he suddenly noticed that the top of coke oven number 35 had collapsed, and the smoke was particularly thick and black. On the third day when the coke was discharged, he carefully inspected the furnace and found that the coke on the top of the coke oven was gray in color, had a high ash content, and had shrunk after the coal was coked, separating the oil channel opening from the gas stack. Based on this phenomenon, they conducted a careful analysis and found that the gas stack was too short, so the gas could not completely pass through the cooler and turn into oil. Based on this situation, they conducted several days of experiments and improved the gas stack. As a result, the black smoke disappeared, and clear yellow tar flowed continuously through the cooler, the oil extraction cycle was extended, and the oil extraction amount from a 50-ton capacity coke oven reached 500 kilograms. The oil yield increased, and the quality of coke also improved, and the coking time was shortened from twelve days to nine days.

    In the past three years, due to the workers' vigorous technological innovations, the factory's production tools and production equipment have also been greatly improved, and it has begun to gradually move towards semi-mechanization and mechanization. This year, a chemical workshop was built, equipped with three one-ton to one-and-a-half-ton distillation pots, two serpentine cooling pipes, and a mixer, with a production capacity of 100 tons of tar per day.

    If you ask the workers here what will happen next year? They will tell you: When you come to see it next year, it will be a new look again.

    向革新的道路飞奔
    ——访山东滕县第一焦化厂
    本报记者　车林　毕万兆
    乘坐津浦铁路火车经过山东枣陶地区的时候，只要你探头向车窗外一望，成群的烟囱和炼焦炉立即投入你的眼里。这就是全国有名的山东滕县第一焦化厂。
    1956年，在这儿炼焦的工人们就开始了从煤气里提取焦油，把它加工制成煤油、柴油、汽油和粗酚等石油化工产品。今年头十个月里，他们生产出的柴油和汽油就有三百多吨，并且试制成功工业用润滑油、防腐油、石蜡、溶剂油和硫酸铵等四十多种产品。焦油的回收率提高到1％以上，各种石油产品的产量比去年增加了三至五倍。
                  土法上马
    从产品看，你也许认为这个厂子有许多近代化的设备，是个具有相当规模的工厂吧！可是，八年以前，这儿只有十八个工人和七座陈旧落后的明火炼焦池，现在，除了新建了几座焦炉以外，大部分还是用旧式的炼焦池生产。
    “土法先上马，逐步再提高”。在他们这里体会十分深刻。1956年的一天，工人出身的生产技术科科长范宗模从报纸上看到了一条从煤气里回收焦油的新闻，他想到自己厂里炼焦不知白白地跑掉了多少焦油，就下定决心要把焦油收回来。他把自己的想法提了出来，立即得到了领导上的支持，在老工人李成信的协助下，在窑炉里砌起了油道，用一根白铁管代替冷凝器插入炉里，就开始了取油试验。焦油取出来了，一座容量三十吨的窑炉收到了三十公斤。这时，他们发现别的地区采用的开滦式密封炼焦炉出的焦油比他们多。但是新砌这样一座炉子，就得用五万块青砖，要花五百元。为了节省开支，他们就大胆地用土坯来代替青砖，建成了一批开滦式炼焦炉。从此，每炉的焦油回收量迅速地上升到了一百八十公斤，产量提高了五倍。就这样，一座破旧落后的土法炼焦厂变成了既出焦又出油的工厂。
                  逐步提高
    土办法取到油了，能不能再挤一挤，多出一些呢？这个念头立刻来到工人们的心里。一天，工人张胜亮站在炼焦炉前观看火焰，他忽然发现三十五号焦炉上顶陷塌，出的煤烟特别浓黑，第三天出焦，他仔细地检查这个炉子，发现焦炉顶部的焦炭色泽灰暗，灰分大，煤炭结焦后收缩了，油道口和煤气垛分开了。根据这一现象，他们进行了仔细的分析，发现煤气垛太短，使煤气不能完全通过冷却器变成油。根据这个情况，他们又经过几天试验，改进煤气垛，结果黑烟不见了，澄黄的焦油源源不断地通过冷却器淌出来了，出油周期延长了，五十吨容量的炼焦炉，抽油量达到了五百公斤。油出多了，焦炭质量也提高了，结焦时间由十二天缩短到九天。
    三年来，由于工人们大搞技术革新，也使工厂的生产工具和生产设备得到了不少的改进，开始逐步走向半机械化、机械化。今年建成了一座化工车间，拥有了三台一吨到一吨半的蒸馏锅，两部蛇式冷却管和一部搅拌机，生产能力达到了日处理焦油一百吨。
    如果你问起这儿的工人明年怎么样？他们会告诉你：当你明年来看的时候，这儿又是一番新的模样了。
