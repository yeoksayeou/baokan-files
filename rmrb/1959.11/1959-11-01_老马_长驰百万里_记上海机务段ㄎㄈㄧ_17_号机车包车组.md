Among the trains running back and forth on the Shanghai-Nanjing line is an advanced locomotive that proudly carries the red flag of ten years of safety. This is the KF1-17 passenger locomotive team of the Shanghai Railway Bureau. From the establishment of the team on June 23, 1949, to September 15 of this year, they have never had a single train operation accident, safely traveling 1.58 million kilometers. This 1.58 million kilometers is equivalent to circling the Earth more than 30 times, or going back and forth from the Earth to the Moon twice. Not only have they achieved remarkable results in safe driving, becoming an advanced banner for the entire bureau, but they have also made excellent achievements in maintaining the locomotive, ensuring punctuality, smooth driving, practicing economy, strengthening collaboration, and making passengers feel satisfied and comfortable. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the speed of travel has increased from 80 kilometers per hour to 100 to 120 kilometers, and the national plan has been fully completed. Because of these achievements, this team has been successively rated as an advanced team by the Shanghai Railway Administration, Shanghai Municipality, and the Ministry of Railways. Since liberation, they have maintained the glorious title of an advanced collective.

Ten years is not a short time. During this long period, the KF1-17 locomotive team has traveled thousands of round trips on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, transporting nearly ten million passengers. They have spent countless mornings shrouded in white fog, dark nights without stars and moon, and days of storms that threatened the safety of the train. They also experienced a number of thrilling events. In these more than 3,600 days, consistently guaranteeing safety is by no means accidental.

The Worse the Conditions, the Greater the Enthusiasm

Some may think that this team was able to achieve such outstanding results because their locomotives were of better quality than others, or the technical level of the workers was higher. On the contrary, they did not have any superior conditions compared to other teams. In the early days after liberation, the P5-104 locomotive assigned to this team was a famous "old timer" taken from the enemy. Driving this locomotive made it difficult to guarantee safety. However, the workers in this team bravely accepted this locomotive, working diligently in their daily work, carefully maintaining it, and complying with the regulations to ensure safe driving. Later, with the development of the railway transportation business, in order to support the needs of other bureaus, the leadership transferred their well-used locomotive and issued them another locomotive. In the winter of 1954, they replaced it with the currently used KF1-17 locomotive. This locomotive was made in England in 1936. It looks long and big, but it is not very useful. When the locomotive is stopped, the steam valve, air pump, and other parts leak air everywhere. When traveling, parts such as copper sleeves "clanked." The workers said: This kind of "big coffin" looks like a "wonton stand" when stopped, and like carrying a "coppersmith's load" when traveling. Because the quality of the locomotive was too poor, it had already been scrapped before liberation. After liberation, it was repaired and reorganized, turning waste into treasure, and put into production. However, accidents such as burning axles and damage still occurred constantly. At that time, there was also a "inevitability of accidents" mentality among the crew, believing that "as long as the wheels turn, accidents will continue," and "when you walk by the river, you can't avoid falling in." They believed that accidents were unavoidable because the quality of the locomotive was not good. However, the comrades of the KF1-17 team realized that the country did not yet have the possibility of using more investment to add new locomotives. To meet the needs of the rapid growth in transportation volume, they had to fully utilize and tap the potential of existing equipment. Therefore, they happily took over this locomotive and made it contribute its greatest strength in completing transportation tasks. "The road is made by people," they were determined to create outstanding results, even under difficult conditions.

The KF1-17 locomotive team's safe travel of 1.58 million kilometers was not smooth sailing. In the beginning, some comrades in the team lacked confidence in ensuring safe driving, and felt "a little scared" when going on duty. Especially with the continuous transfer of older personnel and the continuous arrival of new personnel, they were even more "apprehensive," fearing accidents. Some people even asked the leadership to transfer themselves away from this locomotive. The Party committee patiently educated them, and criticism and self-criticism were also carried out in the team, correcting the wrong attitude of backing down in the face of difficulties. They realized that safety is the lifeline of railway transportation, and safe driving is directly related to the safety of the people's lives and property, and directly related to the smooth progress of the country's socialist construction. Under the leadership of the Party, the members of the KF1-17 team insisted on putting politics in command, treating the locomotive as their home, and thinking of every possible way to maintain the locomotive, so that the "old timer" locomotive could shine brightly and guarantee safe driving.

Be Vigilant at All Times and Prevent Accidents

When the train is running, one must maintain a high degree of vigilance every minute and every second. Even a second of negligence can allow accidents to occur. The KF1-17 locomotive team seriously treats every minute and every second, and promptly prevents and eliminates various accident seedlings. Once, when driver Wang Chengji was driving the train to enter the Wancheng Station, the signal displayed at the lookout station indicated that the train could pass safely. However, they still stared at the signal with their eyes and prepared for all the stopping work. That day happened to be a windy day, and the telecommunications equipment was blown down by the wind, and the telecommunications was suddenly interrupted. Driver Wang Chengji, because he had prepared in advance, calmly stopped the train outside the signal machine. It was very dangerous, the distance between the locomotive and the signal machine was only about fifty meters! At that time, as long as they hesitated a little, or if they were a little slow, they would have rushed into the signal machine, causing a possible train crash accident. Their ten years of safety record was created in the tense battle every minute and every second.

It is not enough to just be vigilant and not relax every minute. In order to be responsible to the country and the people, they also adopted the method of "prevention first, pulling up seedlings and digging up roots," and promptly eliminated accident factors in the early stages of budding. They treat possible accident seedlings very seriously, and must trace the roots and prevent them in advance. They humbly learn from the advanced experience of others. When others have accidents, they seriously analyze the reasons and formulate prevention methods to block all loopholes. Once, when a locomotive was being washed and inspected, they forgot to install the steam chamber air valve, which caused an accident. Afterwards, the analysis showed that the reason was that the inspection was not thorough and they rushed out of the garage. They learned from this lesson and stipulated that they must check carefully in the future and not be negligent. For example, a team, due to lookout negligence, emitted a signal at Zhoujingxiang Station. The KF1-17 team learned from this lesson, achieved uninterrupted lookout, and stipulated a system of two people looking out three times at the signal. They also often adopted the method of mutual questioning and answering between the three shifts of the team to improve their ability to prevent accidents. If the team cannot answer, they will ask the technical staff for advice. They usually think of various ways to constantly improve their skills in order to prevent accidents from happening under complex circumstances.

Strictly Implement Rules and Regulations

During the ten years, although the KF1-17 locomotive team has changed locomotives and members several times, they have still gradually accumulated a complete set of rules.

This team has a set of rules for locomotive acceptance, shift handover, train operation, after-work analysis, and political and technical learning, and strictly handles matters according to the rules. They come to work early, and carefully and strictly check the locomotive according to the division of labor and fixed order. Even a small screw, the hammer is always tapping in one place after another, and they will never be negligent. For parts that are prone to fatigue damage, such as KF1 type crescent plate rivets, which are most easily broken, they pay special attention to them during inspection. Once, driver Wu Baozeng checked out that three rivets had been broken, preventing an accident from happening. Another time, before departure, they checked and found that the average beam opening sheath of the tender had cracks, and immediately repaired and replaced it, preventing a possible locomotive overturning accident. During operation, they devoted themselves to their work, regardless of the weather, day or night, they strictly implemented the call and response and confirmation system, and always insisted on the system of two people confirming the signal more than three times. The more tired they are in the second half of the night, the more they invigorate their spirits. When stopping at the station, even if it is only a few minutes, they get off the locomotive to knock and touch, to prevent any unexpected events from happening. After they hand over the shift, they also hold an analysis meeting to carefully summarize the day's work experience. If there are any places where the implementation of the system is not serious enough, they carry out criticism and self-criticism, find out the reasons, and propose prevention and improvement measures. When they implement the system or learn from the experience of others, they always combine it with their own experience to make the original system more perfect.

Because they have accumulated a lot of experience in their work and found some patterns, they systematically combined these experiences and patterns into a set of rules, and meticulously implemented these rules in their daily work. In this way, they have prevented 96 various major and minor accidents in the past few years, ensuring safe driving.

Currently, under the encouragement of the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, this team is holding high the red flag of the general line and marching towards two million kilometers of safe driving!

    “老马”长驰百万里
    记上海机务段ㄎㄈㄧ——17号机车包车组
    在沪宁线上来往奔驶的列车中，有着一台高举着十年安全红旗的先进机车，这就是上海机务段ㄎㄈㄧ—17号客运机车包车组。他们从1949年6月23日成立包车组起，到今年9月15日为止，从未出过一次行车责任事故，安全行驶了一百五十八万公里。这一百五十八万公里，相当于绕地球三十多圈，或相当于从地球到月亮的两个来回。他们不但在安全行驶上成绩显著，成为全局的一面先进旗帜，而且在保养机车，保证正点，平稳行驶，厉行节约，加强协作，使旅客感到满意、舒服等方面也做出了良好的成绩。去年大跃进以来，行车速度从每小时八十公里一下提高到一百到一百二十公里，又全面地完成了国家计划。因为以上这些成绩，这个包车组先后被评为上海铁路总局、上海市、铁道部的先进包车组。解放以来，他们一直保持着先进集体的光荣称号。
    十年，不是一个短暂的时刻，在这漫长的岁月中，ㄎㄈㄧ—17号机车包车组，在沪宁线上奔驰了数千个来回，运送了近千万名旅客，曾经度过了无数威胁行车安全的白雾迷漫的早晨，星月无光的黑夜，狂风暴雨的日子，也曾经历过不少惊险的事件，在这三千六百多天的日子里，始终一贯地保证安全，这决不是偶然的事情。
    条件越差干劲越大
    可能有人认为，这个包车组能够获得这样出色的成绩，一定是他们的机车质量比别人好，或是工人的技术水平比别人高。恰恰相反，他们并没有比其他包车组有任何优越的条件。解放初期，这个包车组所包的一台P5—104号机车，是从敌人手里接收来的一台出名的“老爷货”。驾驶这台机车很难保证不出事故。但是，这个组的工人却勇敢地接受了这台机车，在日常工作中兢兢业业，认真保养和遵守制度，保证了安全行车。后来，随着铁路运输事业的发展，为了支援外局需要，领导上把他们这台已经用熟了的机车外调了，另发给他们一台机车。到1954年冬天，又换了现在使用的ㄎㄈㄧ—17号机车。这台机车是英国1936年造的，看起来又长又大，可是不顶用。机车停的时候，蒸气阀、风泵等到处漏气，行走的时候，铜套等部件“铿锵”作响。工人们说：这种“大棺材”停的时候像副“馄饨担”，行驶的时候像挑“铜匠担”。因为机车质量太差，在解放前就已经报废了，解放后经过修复、整理，废物复活，投入了生产，但是烧轴、破损等事故还是不断出现。当时在乘务人员中也有一种“只要车轮转，事故就不断”，“人在河边走，难免不落水”的“事故难免论”思想，他们认为机车质量不好，事故是难以避免的。可是ㄎㄈㄧ—17号包车组的同志认识到，国家暂时还没有可能用更多的投资来增添新机车，而满足运输量急剧增长的需要，只有充分利用和挖掘现有设备潜力，因此，他们愉快地把这台机车接下来，使它在完成运输任务中贡献出最大的力量。“路是人走出来的”，他们下定决心，越是在困难的条件下，越是要创造出出色的成绩。
    ㄎㄈㄧ—17号包车组安全行驶一百五十八万公里，并不是一帆风顺的。他们中间也曾经有少数同志在开始时对保证安全行车信心不足，出乘时有些“汗毛凛凛”。特别在老人员不断调出，新人员不断调进的情况下，更是“提心吊胆”，怕万一出事故。曾经有人要求领导把自己调离这台机车，党委耐心地对他们进行了教育，在小组中也开展了批评与自我批评，改正了知难而退的错误态度，认识到安全是铁路运输的命根子，行车安全直接关系到人民生命财产的安全，直接关系到国家社会主义建设事业的顺利进行。ㄎㄈㄧ—17号包车组的组员们由于在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，以车为家，想尽各种办法保养机车，这样就使“老爷”机车大放异采，保证了行车安全。
    时刻警惕预防事故
    列车在运行中，一分一秒的时间都要保持高度的警惕，即使有一秒钟的疏忽大意，都可能给事故钻上空子。ㄎㄈㄧ—17号机车包车组认真地对待一分一秒，及时地防止和消灭了各种事故苗子。有一次，司机王承基驾驶着列车要进湾城站时，了望站上显示的信号标明，列车可以安全通过了。可是他们还是目不转睛地注视着信号，做好一切停车的准备工作。那天正遇大风，电讯设备被风吹坏，电讯突然中断。司机王承基由于事前有准备，就不慌不忙地把列车停在信号机外面。险得很，机车和信号机的距离只有五十米左右！当时只要稍为犹豫一下，或者手脚稍为迟钝一点，就会闯进信号机，造成可能发生的撞车事故。他们十年的安全记录，就是在每一分一秒都进行着紧张的战斗中创造出来的。
    光是分秒不松、时刻警惕，还是不够的。他们为了对国家负责，对人民负责，还采取了“预防为主，拔苗挖根”的办法，及时地把事故因素消灭在萌芽的初期。他们对待可能发生的事故苗子，是十分严肃的，一定要追根究源，预加防止。对别人的先进经验，虚心学习；别人出了事故，他们就认真分析原因，订出防止办法，堵死一切漏洞。有一次有台机车在洗检时，忘了把汽室空气阀装上，发生了事故，事后分析原因是由于检查不彻底匆忙出车库所造成的。他们就吸取了这个教训，规定今后一定要仔细检查，不能疏忽。又如有个包车组，因了望疏忽，在周泾巷站冒出信号。ㄎㄈㄧ—17号包车组吸取了这个教训，做到了望不间断，规定了二人了望三遍信号的制度。他们还经常在包车组三班之间，采取互相提问，互相解答的办法来提高防止事故的本领；如果小组不能解答时，就去请教技术人员。他们平时想出各种办法来不断提高技术，以便在错综复杂的情况下防止事故发生。
    严格执行规章制度
    ㄎㄈㄧ—17号机车包车组在十年之中，虽然调换过几次机车，调换过许多成员，可是他们仍能逐步积累起一套完整的制度。
    这个包车组从机车验收、上下班交接、列车运行、下班分析到政治技术学习，都有一套制度，并且严格地按制度办事。上班来得早，按照分工和固定顺序对机车认真严格地检查一遍，那怕是一个小螺丝钉，鎯头总是在一处一处地敲到，决不疏忽大意。对惯性破坏的部件，如ㄎㄈㄧ型月牙钣铆钉最容易折断，他们在检查中就特别注意。有一次司机长武宝增就检查出三个铆钉已经折断，防止了事故的发生。又有一次，出车前检查出煤水车的平均梁开口鞘子有裂纹，当即进行补配，防止了一次可能发生的机车倾复事故。在运行中，他们全神贯注地对待工作，不管天气好坏，不管白天黑夜，都严格执行呼唤应答和确认制度，始终坚持二人确认三遍以上信号的制度，越是在下半夜容易疲倦的时刻，越是振作精神。在停站的时候，即使是几分钟他们也下机车去敲敲摸摸，防止一切意外事件的发生。他们在交班以后，还要举行分析会议，认真总结一天的工作经验，如果在执行制度上有不够认真的地方，就开展批评与自我批评，找出原因，提出防止和改进的措施。他们执行制度或学习别人的经验的时候，总是结合自己的经验，使原有的制度更加完善。
    由于他们在工作中积累了不少经验，摸到了一些规律，把这些经验和规律系统起来成为一套制度，并且在日常工作中一丝不苟地执行了这些制度，这样，几年来共防止了各种大小事故九十六件，保证了安全行车。
    目前，这个包车组在党的八届八中全会公报的鼓舞下，高举总路线的红旗，正在向二百万公里安全行车进军！
