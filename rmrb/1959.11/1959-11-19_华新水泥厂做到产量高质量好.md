Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 17th. The Huaxin Cement Plant in Huangshi City, Hubei Province, while vigorously increasing cement production, has continuously adopted measures to improve product quality. Since the beginning of this year, the plant has not only fulfilled the state production plan every month, but as of November 10th, cement production has already exceeded the total output of last year; and the quality of all cement leaving the factory is up to standard.

In the first quarter of this year, the Huaxin Cement Plant adopted measures such as "tail-end kiln feeding" and improved operations, which greatly increased the output of cement kilns. However, because some workshops did not pay enough attention to quality, and did not take effective measures to overcome the shortcomings of uneven and mixed raw materials and large fluctuations in coal composition, the quality of cement clinker was affected. Starting in June, the factory Party committee strengthened quality education for employees and launched a factory-wide quality inspection, forming a situation where quality was grasped at all levels and by everyone in the factory. They improved the composition of the raw materials added at the tail of the kiln, adding some limestone and iron ore to the added mineral slag powder to make the composition of the added dry and wet materials similar; they changed from manual feeding to mechanical feeding to make the materials evenly added; they improved the coal management system to stabilize the coal composition; and they further improved the operating methods. In addition, the technicians from the laboratory went to the workshops and checked product quality with the workers, and summarized the experience of high output and high quality. On this basis, they improved the three major quality management systems: quality cards, quality management, and production control system diagrams. In order to ensure quality, all workshop teams implemented pre-shift arrangements, mid-shift inspections, and post-shift summaries, and carried out competitions around improving quality. After such a series of efforts, the quality of clinker was quickly improved. The compressive strength per square centimeter in the third quarter increased by 100 kilograms compared with the second quarter, reaching 700 kilograms, which greatly exceeded the highest level of clinker quality in the factory. Subsequently, the factory organized employees to further improve the batching method, so that the clinker quality was further increased to more than 750 kilograms, and it became more stable.

Due to the improvement of clinker quality, the quality of cement has been further guaranteed, the proportion of mixed materials has been greatly increased, cement production has been increased, and costs have been reduced.

    华新水泥厂做到产量高质量好
    新华社武汉17日电　湖北黄石市华新水泥厂在大力增产水泥的同时，不断采取措施改进产品质量。今年以来，这个厂不但月月完成国家生产计划，到11月10日止，水泥产量已经超过去年全年；而且出厂的水泥质量全部合格。
    华新水泥厂在今年第一季度采取“窑尾喂料”和改进操作等措施，大大提高了水泥窑的产量。但是由于有些车间对质量重视不够，没有采取有力的措施来克服掺喂的原料杂乱不匀，煤的成分波动大等缺点，以致水泥熟料的质量受到影响。工厂党委从6月份起加强了对职工的质量教育，并发动全厂职工进行质量大检查，在全厂形成层层抓质量，人人抓质量的局面。他们改进了窑尾加入的原料的成分，在加喂的矿渣粉中加一部分石灰石和铁矿石，使加喂的干料和湿料成分接近；改人工喂料为机械喂料，使料加得均匀；改进了煤的管理制度，稳定煤的成分；进一步改进了操作方法。另外，化验室的技术人员到车间和工人一起检查产品质量，总结高产优质经验，在这个基础上健全了质量卡片、质量管理、生产控制系统图等三大质量管理制度。各车间班组为了保证质量，都实行班前布置、班中检查、班后总结等，并围绕提高质量开展竞赛。经过这样一系列的努力，熟料质量很快提高，第三季度每平方厘米的耐压力比第二季度提高一百公斤，达到七百公斤，大大超过了这个厂熟料质量的最高水平。接着，工厂又组织职工进一步改进配料方法，使熟料质量再提高到七百五十公斤以上，而且更加稳定。
    由于熟料质量的提高，水泥的质量有了进一步保证，掺混合材料的比例大大增加，提高了水泥产量，成本也降低了。
