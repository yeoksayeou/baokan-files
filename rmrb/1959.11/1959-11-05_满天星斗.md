    A Sky Full of Stars
    Our Correspondent
    In the heroic decade of the new China, we have achieved many magnificent feats that have shaken the entire world: the Five-Star Red Flag rising amidst the roar of cannons, the heavy blow dealt to the aggressors by the great movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, the victorious reality of the magnificent First Five-Year Plan, the success of the people's communization... Today, the high speed we have achieved in socialist industrial construction once again fills our brothers and friends with joy and makes our enemies tremble with fear. Our speed of progress is forever beyond the reach of the entire capitalist world.
    Who created the high speed? It is the more than six thousand advanced producers at the hero conferences and the millions of people they are connected with!
    Among the more than six thousand standard-bearers of the Great Leap Forward, there are familiar figures from major enterprises across the country; there are also hundreds of new heroes from the small and medium-sized enterprises built during the large-scale development of local industries and steel production. They are a new force on China's industrial front. Among them are Zhao Yugui, a female steelworker from the "Hexi Corridor," Chong Shunyuan, a converter expert from Qingdao, Baolidawu from the TieMu factory of the Bayannur League People's Commune in Inner Mongolia, Yang Fengqi, a representative from the Qilian Mountain Copper Smelting Plant... They come from the border regions, inland areas, coastal cities, and villages.
    The exchange of experiences in the Great Leap Forward among advanced producers from central and local industries, heavy and light industries, large and medium-sized enterprises, and enterprises using both foreign and indigenous methods is of great significance. This is where the strength of China's high-speed construction lies. It is they who have spread the seeds of the steel industry across the motherland in the past two years, making the sound of machines resonate in thousands of cities and villages, building hydroelectric power stations on thousands of rivers, surveying and exploring vast mineral deposits in deep mountains and remote areas, and sending hundreds of millions of agricultural implements and tens of thousands of tons of chemical fertilizers to the countryside... It is they who have brought a prosperous situation to the motherland of the Great Leap Forward, making industries bloom everywhere and enterprises like a sky full of stars in the night sky.
    Their achievements bring to mind the scene of large-scale industrial development and nationwide steelmaking. At that time, nearly a billion people across the country were mobilized, tirelessly striving for large-scale industrial development. At that time, red flags formed forests on high mountains, and people's footprints covered rivers, gullies, snowy mountains, and grasslands in search of treasures. The furnace fires of steelmaking illuminated every piece of land in the motherland, hundreds of millions of people stretched their shovels into the underground coal seams, hundreds of millions of simple factory buildings rose from empty ground, and millions of skilled craftsmen made machines for themselves...
    The power generated by the concerted action of hundreds of millions of people is inestimable; it can topple mountains and fill rivers. The movement for large-scale industrial development and steelmaking has brought us a universal harvest in industry. The industrial blank spots left by old China have been filled in a short two years. Before 1958, only twenty of China's twenty-eight provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions were capable of iron smelting, and eleven of them had an annual output of less than 1,500 tons. Only fifteen were capable of steelmaking, and six of them had an annual output of less than 5,000 tons. Now, except for Tibet, all provinces and cities across the country have steel industries, and the production level is at least tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of tons. The number of provinces capable of producing power generation equipment has increased from two to fifteen, the number of regions producing sulfuric acid has increased from thirteen to twenty-four, the number of regions producing cement has increased from seventeen to twenty-three... These industries have all strongly supported the agricultural bumper harvest movement in the past two years. Henan Province was threatened by the worst drought in decades this year. At this time, the industrial departments supplied the rural areas with 5,193 sets of irrigation and drainage machinery, 2.95 million other water-lifting tools, and 7.45 million various machine parts in July and August alone. The drought was overcome, and Henan Province achieved a bumper harvest.
    So, who has given the people this power? It is the people themselves, it is the wise leadership of the Party. Our people understand their situation. Our country was almost a century behind in industry, and old China left us with large areas of blank space. The people are eager to change the "poor and blank" face of the motherland and turn the vast land of the motherland into a paradise of prosperous industry and agriculture in the shortest possible time. This beautiful hope contains infinite power. At this time, our Party saw the power of the 600 million people united by socialist relations of production, saw the urgent need for us to move forward rapidly, saw the hopes of the people, saw the abundant resources of the vast land of the motherland, and saw all the favorable conditions and potential. We could not but propose a complete set of policies of walking on two legs. Only in this way can we speed up the construction of the motherland.
    The people responded to the Party's expectations with practical actions and realized their aspirations with heroic actions. In the freezing cold, in the raging wind and rain, and in the scorching heat, they were fearless and marched forward triumphantly. They followed the Party's instructions to run industries, run industries according to the different local conditions, making them as large as possible if possible, as small as possible if not, using foreign methods if possible, using indigenous methods if not, using machines if available, using manual labor if not, using materials if available, finding materials themselves if not, using funds if available, and thinking of ways together if not, using technology if available, and learning technology if not... The masses said, "Thousands of difficulties and ten thousands of hardships, with the leadership of the Party, nothing is difficult." Tao Aiying, a 24-year-old Zhuang woman, took the initiative to sign up when she heard that iron was to be smelted. Others were afraid that she didn't understand and advised her to go back. She said, "If I don't understand, I'll learn. With the leadership of the Party, I'm not afraid of not being able to do it?" She led a dozen women to build a furnace in three days and three nights. She went to other furnaces more than once to learn, asking people how to mix materials, how to weigh ore, how to watch the flames, how to distinguish the fire color, how to seal the furnace door, and how to tap iron? Finally, in a short time, the furnace flowed with molten iron. The steel warriors of the Manghe Iron and Steel Plant in Henan held a "Zhuge Liang meeting" next to the ironmaking furnace, using water turbines to drive blowers, so that the water of the Manghe River could serve the blast furnace. In the "Give advice if you have ideas, give effort if you have strength, see who invents more, and compare who contributes more" campaign, people created an overhead cableway to transport ore, which was 124 times more efficient than before. They proudly told others: "Hey, at that time, we had: a hundred flowers blooming, a hundred furnaces competing for ability, everyone creating, and everyone inventing!" Starting from scratch, they not only set up iron and steel plants, but also set up 185 small-scale factories and mines for coal, electricity, and other industries. Yang Junhai, the representative of the Manghe Iron and Steel Plant, proudly told everyone at the hero conference: "... In the beginning, some people said, hey! Farmers can smelt steel? What a strange thing! But we won. Before last year, we didn't even recognize ore. Now? Great! Blast furnaces rise, chimneys stand tall, machines roar, and piles of iron are like mountains. Workers can tell the sulfur content of the product by looking at the fire color, and they can tell whether the machine is malfunctioning by listening to the sound. The farmers of yesterday have become technical workers today!" This is not only the voice of the Manghe Iron and Steel Plant workers, but also the voice of the great victory of industrial construction across the country. This voice is full of strength and confidence.
    With such people, we will have everything we need. If we have a more urgent need, it is time; and the policy of walking on two legs and the people's unparalleled enthusiasm in implementing this policy have precisely won us great time. The facts have concluded that the policy of walking on two legs is high speed. In 1958 alone, we achieved very high growth rates in twelve products such as rolled steel, electricity, raw coal, natural petroleum, synthetic ammonia, sulfuric acid, cement, machine-made sugar, soda ash, and caustic soda, which was two to eight times the average annual growth rate of the total industrial output value during the First Five-Year Plan. During the First Five-Year Plan, the speed of our total industrial output value increased quite rapidly, averaging 18% per year. That is to say, according to this speed, it would take two to eight years respectively to reach the level of the twelve products in 1958. The industries of various provinces have developed at double the speed. In 1958, the total industrial output value of the country increased by 66%. In the same year, the total industrial output value of the United States decreased by 6.5%, and the United Kingdom decreased by 0.9%. We are moving forward, and they are retreating. The speed we have achieved is unimaginable for them. Taking steel as an example, in 1958, we increased from 5.35 million tons to 11.08 million tons, more than doubling, which cannot be found in the entire history of capitalist development!
    Our high speed of progress is very surprising to our enemies. Those professional plunderers and the jackals behind them say that we have made "disastrous mistakes," that we have "completely failed," and that we have "wasted raw materials and manpower." What can we say to these fools? Prejudice and fear have turned them into idiots, unable to see the obvious facts and unable to distinguish between economic advantages and disadvantages. For example, although our steel production in 1958 doubled, thanks to the injection of the power of the whole people, the investment was saved by about one-third. The new coal mine capacity increased by 30 million tons, but because small and medium-sized ones accounted for two-thirds, it saved about 30% of the funds compared with the First Five-Year Plan. They are not interested in such things. For example, at the end of 1957, 278 iron ore deposits were proven in the country, and only about ten were suitable for building large-scale iron and steel complexes. According to the design requirements, if only large-scale ones were built, the other 268 mining points could not be built into factories or mines. However, under the policy of developing large, medium, and small enterprises at the same time, factories or mines were built at almost all of these mining points. Is this economical or uneconomical? They are also unwilling to talk about these things. The reason why they are yelling so loudly is because they are afraid of our speed, afraid that we will catch up with them in a not-so-long time! The more glorious achievements we have, the more curses we will receive. That is precisely the enemy's sorrow and our victory!
    Of course, we also know that among the tens of thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises, some are very small, some are still using indigenous methods for production, and some workers are not skilled enough and need to be rectified and improved. We are already doing it. The heroes who attended the meeting presented countless vivid examples to tell us that many ironmaking furnaces and steelmaking furnaces have been transformed from indigenous to foreign, and the utilization coefficient of many furnaces has reached the level of large foreign furnaces, making us have more than 300 steel bases throughout the country. Many enterprises have changed from manual operation to mechanical production, and there are tens of thousands of such new factories and mines across the country. Among the more than 700,000 small industrial enterprises run by the people's communes, tens of thousands are using modern and indigenous methods for production. Although these enterprises are small, they have strong vitality. They are developing and progressing, and are on the road from small to large and from indigenous to foreign. This road is broad, endless, and the future is bright. Today, they may seem like a large group of very small stars, but they contain great light. Soon, they will emit brighter brilliance and merge with the brilliance of huge enterprises, emitting dazzling light, illuminating the prosperous and strong land of the motherland!

    新中国在英雄的十年里，取得了许许多多轰动整个世界的丰功伟绩：五星红旗从隆隆的炮声中升起、伟大的抗美援朝运动对侵略者的沉重打击、气势磅礴的第一个五年计划的胜利现实、人民公社化的成功……。今天，我们在社会主义工业建设中获得的高速度，又一次使我们的兄弟和朋友欢欣鼓舞，使我们的敌人胆战心惊。我们前进的速度，是整个资本主义世界永远永远望尘莫及的。
    是谁创造了高速度？是群英会上的六千多名先进生产者和他们联系着的千百万人民！
    在六千多名大跃进的旗手中间，有我们熟悉的人物，他们来自全国的各大企业里；也有数百名新的英雄，他们来自大办地方工业、大办钢铁时建成的中小型企业里，他们是我国工业战线上一支新的劲旅。他们中，有“河西走廊”的女钢铁工人赵玉桂，青岛转炉能手重顺远，内蒙古草原巴彦锡尼河人民公社铁木工厂的宝力道，祁连山炼铜厂的代表杨凤岐，……。他们来自边疆、内地、沿海的城市和乡村。
    中央工业和地方工业、重工业和轻工业、大型企业和中小型企业、用洋法生产的企业和用土法生产的企业的先进生产者们在一起交流大跃进的经验，有着巨大的意义，这是我国能够进行高速度建设的力量所在。就是他们，两年来把钢铁工业的种子遍播祖国大地，让万千个城市和乡村响起了机器的声音，在千百条河流上建设了水电站，从深山野岭中踏勘出大量的矿藏，给农村送去亿万件农具和数以万吨计的化学肥料……；就是他们，给大跃进的祖国带来繁荣的局面，使工业遍地开花，使企业像夜空中的满天星斗。
    他们的成就使人想起了大办工业、全民炼钢的情景。那时，全国出动了近亿人口，为大办工业奋斗不息。当时，高山峻岭上红旗成林，人们的足迹遍及大小河流、沟涧、雪山草地去寻找宝藏，大炼钢铁的炉火映红了祖国每一片土地，成百万的人把铁铲伸向地下的煤层，亿万间简易的厂房从空地上升起，几百万能工巧匠给自己制造机器……。
    亿万人民同心协力的行动，所产生的力量是不可估量的，可以扳倒高山，填平河流。大办工业、大办钢铁的运动，给我们工业带来了普遍的丰收。旧中国留下的工业空白点，在短短的两年里被我们填上了。1958年以前，我国二十八个省、市、自治区，能够炼铁的只有二十个，而其中有十一个是年产一千五百吨以下的，能够炼钢的只有十五个，其中有六个是年产量不到五千吨，而现在除西藏以外，全国所有的省市都有了钢铁工业，而生产水平都在万吨或数十万吨以上。能够生产发电设备的省份，由原来的两个增加到十五个、生产硫酸的地区由十三个增加到二十四个、生产水泥的地区由十七个增加到二十三个……。这些工业，都曾有力地支援了两年来的农业丰产运动。河南省，今年遭受到几十年没有过的大旱的威胁。这时，工业部门只是在7、8两个月份，就供应了农村排灌机械五千一百九十三台、其他提水工具二百九十五万件、各种机具零件七百四十五万件。旱灾被战胜了，河南省获得了丰收。
    那末，是谁赋与了人民这种力量呢？是人民自己，是党的英明领导。我们的人民懂得自己的处境，我国在工业上差不多落后了一个世纪，旧中国留给我们的是大片空白。人民迫切要求改变祖国“一穷二白”的面貌，要在最短的时间里把祖国广大国土变成工农业大繁荣的乐园。在这个美好的希望里面，蕴藏着无穷无尽的力量。这时，我们的党看到了由社会主义生产关系团结起来的六亿人民的力量，看到了我们必须飞速前进的迫切需要，看到了人民的希望，看到了祖国地大物博的丰富资源，看到了一切有利条件和潜力，不能不提出一整套两条腿走路的方针。唯有这样，才能加快祖国的建设。
    人民用实际行动回答了党的期望，用英勇的行动去实现自己的愿望。他们在天寒地冻的日子，在狂风暴雨中，在酷暑的炎热里，无所畏惧，高歌猛进。他们遵照党的指示去办工业，按照当地不同的条件去办工业，能大则大，不能大则小，能洋则洋，不能洋则土，有机器用机器，没有机器用手工，有材料办，没有材料自己去找，有资金办，没有资金大家想办法，有技术办，没有技术去学……。群众说：“千难万难，有了党的领导就不难。”二十四岁的僮族妇女陶爱英，听说要炼铁了，主动跑去报名，别人怕她不懂劝她回去，她说：“不懂就学，有党的领导，怕做不成？”她带领十几个妇女，大干三天三夜建成一座炉子。她不止一次跑到别的炉子上去学习，询问人家怎样配料、怎样称矿石、怎样看火苗、怎样分火色、怎样封炉门、怎样出铁？终于在短时间里使炉子流出了铁水。河南漭河钢铁厂的钢铁战士们，在炼铁炉旁召开“诸葛亮会”，用水轮机带动鼓风机，使漭河的水为高炉服务。在开展“有计献计，有力出力，看谁发明多，比谁贡献大”运动时，人们创造了架空索道运输矿石，效率相等于原来的一百二十四倍。他们骄傲地告诉别人说：“嘿，我们那时候是：百花竞放，百炉争能，人人创造，个个发明！”他们白手起家，不但办起了钢铁厂，而且连带着办起了煤炭、电力等小型厂矿一百八十五个。漭河钢铁厂的代表杨俊海在群英会上自豪地告诉大家说：“……开始，有人说，嘿！农民会炼钢？怪事情！可是，我们胜利了。去年以前，我们连矿石也不认识，现在呢？好了！高炉群起、烟囱林立、机器轰鸣、铁堆如山。工人们，看看火色可以知道产品含硫高低，听听响声就知道机器有没有故障，昨天的农民，今天已成为技术工人了！”这不单是漭河钢铁职工们的声音，而是全国工业建设大胜利的声音，这声音里充满着力量和自信。
    有了这样的人民，就会有我们所需要的一切。如果说我们还有更迫切的需要，那就是时间；而两条腿走路的方针、人民执行这一方针的无比热情，恰恰使我们赢得了大好光阴。事实给两条腿走路方针做出的结论是：它就是高速度。只是1958年，我们在轧钢、电力、原煤、天然石油、合成氨、硫酸、水泥、机制糖、纯碱、烧碱等十二种产品方面，取得了很高的增长速度，等于第一个五年计划期间工业总产值每年平均增长速度的二至八倍。第一个五年计划期间，我们工业总产值提高的速度是相当快的，每年平均18％，这就是说，依照这个速度，想达到1958年十二种产品的水平，分别需要二年到八年的时间。各个省的工业，加倍地向前发展了。1958年，全国的工业总产值，则增长了66％。就在这一年，美国的工业总产值降低了6.5％，英国降低了0.9％。我们在前进，他们在后退。我们取得的速度，是他们不敢设想的。单以钢为例，1958年我们由五百三十五万吨提高到一千一百零八万吨，增长一倍多，在整个资本主义发展史上是找不出这种速度的！
    我们前进的高速度很使我们的敌人吃惊。那些掠夺的职业家们和跟在他们身后的鬃狗们说我们犯了“灾难性的错误”，说我们“彻底失败了”，说我们“浪费了原料和人力”。对于这些蠢才我们能说什么呢？成见和恐惧使他们成了白痴，看不到明显的事实，也分不清经济上的利弊了。比方说，我们1958年的钢铁虽然加倍地增长，由于注入了全民的力量，而投资却节省了三分之一左右，新增煤炭矿井能力三千万吨，由于中小型的占三分之二，却比第一个五年计划期间节省了30％左右的资金。如此种种他们是不感兴趣的。又比方说，1957年底全国探明铁矿二百七十八处，适于建设大型钢铁联合企业的只有十处左右，按照设计要求如果仅建大型的，其他二百六十八处矿点就不能建厂、开采，但是在大中小并举的方针下，所有这些矿点差不多都建起了工厂或矿山。这些，究竟是经济，还是不经济呢？他们也不愿意谈这些事。他们所以大叫大嚷，是因为他们害怕我们的速度，害怕我们将在一段不太长的时间里面赶过他们！每当我们有了辉煌成就的时候，受到的咒骂会越多，那正是敌人悲哀，也正是我们的胜利！
    当然，我们也知道在数以万计的中小型企业中，有些规模很小，有些还用土法进行生产，有些工人技术还不够熟练，还需要整顿、提高。我们已经在做了。到会的英雄们摆出无数个生动的事例告诉我们，许多座炼铁炉和炼钢炉已由土到洋了，不少炉子的利用系数已达到了大洋炉的水平，使我们在全国内拥有三百多个钢铁的基点。许多企业已变手工操作为机械生产了，全国有数以万计这样的新厂矿。人民公社办起来的七十多万个小型工业企业，已有上万个是采用现代化和土洋结合的方法进行生产。这些企业虽然小，却有着强大的生命力，它们在发展、在进步，正走着由小到大、由土到洋的道路。这条路是宽阔的、没有尽头的、前途是一片光明的。今天看来，它们虽然是一大群很小的小星星，却蕴藏着巨大的光亮。不久，它们将放出更明亮的光辉，和巨大的企业的光辉交融在一起，射出耀眼的光芒，照耀着祖国繁荣富强的大地！
