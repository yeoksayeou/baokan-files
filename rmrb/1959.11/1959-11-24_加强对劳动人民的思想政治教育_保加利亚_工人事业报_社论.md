    Strengthen Ideological and Political Education for the Working People
    Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" Newspaper Editorial

    The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" published an editorial on November 17, calling for the strengthening of ideological and political education for the working people. Excerpts are as follows:

    The Bulgarian people are transforming the Party's fighting slogan of completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule into a living reality with unprecedented creative enthusiasm and conscious labor.

    The realization of this magnificent program requires the working people to have a high level of socialist consciousness, skillful work ethic, and initiative. Therefore, concern for the ideological and political education of the working people should become a constant and fighting task for Party committees and Party organizations at all levels.

    In order to raise the people's socialist consciousness and cultural level, the Party and the state have carried out extensive political and theoretical education work. A large contingent of propagandists and reporters, through various forms, tools, and methods of mass political work – through giving reports, lectures, holding group discussions and conducting individual conversations, and through newspapers, popular propaganda materials, and local radio stations, etc. – educate the working people in the spirit of socialist patriotism and Marxism-Leninism.

    Due to effective ideological and political work, the consciousness of the working people is constantly growing, and they actively participate in the struggle to achieve the tasks put forward by the Party and the state on schedule. Practice has proven that the ideological and political work is more effective where Party organizations and leaders regularly pay attention to arming propagandists and agitators ideologically and politically, caring for their training, and enriching their knowledge.

    Although great achievements have been made in the ideological and political education of the working people, ideological and political work still cannot fully adapt to the requirements put forward by the tremendous political and economic tasks of socialist development. In some places, there are still phenomena that should not exist in a socialist society, such as the undermining of labor and state discipline, and manifestations of localism. Due to the mistakes of the leaders of some states, orders from other states have not been completed, thus disrupting the production plans of enterprises and organizations in other states.

    Ideological education is a powerful weapon of the Party and should be carried out with a fighting and offensive spirit. We should destroy manifestations of localism and disregard for public and national interests, fight against violators of labor discipline, laziness, and theft, and fight against manifestations of bourgeois influence and the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness. We must never forget that the ideological and political education of the masses is not a task to be rushed, but should be carried out regularly in conjunction with all exciting domestic and international issues. It is of great significance for propagandists and agitators to take the initiative to personally talk with people on every important issue.

    The new and great tasks put forward by the Party to the people of the whole country entrust the leading Party organs and Party organizations at all levels to further improve the methods of leading political and educational work, to help agitators at any time and in any place, to arm them with more systematic knowledge, and to supply them with popular teaching materials. The success of this work depends first and foremost on the training of agitators, to make them good at closely combining their reports and talks with the daily practical work of the working people.

    Carrying out ideological and political work among the working people is the daily task of the leading Party organs and Party organizations at all levels and the entire Party. Now, for the past three months, the agitators in the industrial and construction sectors and the entire ideological and political work are facing a very important task. They should arouse the labor enthusiasm of workers, technicians and engineers, and launch a labor competition among workers, technicians and engineers, so that they will resolutely fight to tap new potentials and possibilities for completing all the targets set by this year's plan.

    It is necessary to fully carry out mass political work in the countryside—in agricultural production cooperatives, machine tractor stations and state farms. Through political work in production teams, production groups and livestock farms, agitators should mobilize the strength of rural laborers to harvest crops faster, complete autumn plowing and sowing on schedule, and further develop animal husbandry.

    The completion of these fighting tasks is the guarantee for completing the Five-Year Plan within a shortened period.

### 加强对劳动人民的思想政治教育  保加利亚“工人事业报”社论

    加强对劳动人民的思想政治教育
    保加利亚“工人事业报”社论
    保加利亚“工人事业报”11月17日发表社论，号召加强对劳动人民的思想政治教育。摘要如下：
    保加利亚人民正以前所未有的创造性的热情和自觉的劳动，把党所提出的提前完成五年计划的战斗口号变为活生生的现实。
    实现这个宏伟的纲领，要求劳动人民有高度的社会主义觉悟、巧干精神和积极性。因此，关心对劳动人民的思想政治教育工作，应当成为各级党委会和党组织的经常的战斗任务。
    为了提高人民的社会主义觉悟和文化水平，党和国家进行了广泛的政治理论教育工作。宣传鼓动员和报告员的庞大队伍通过群众政治工作的各种形式、工具和方法——通过作报告、讲课、举行小组座谈会和进行个别交谈，通过报刊、通俗的宣传材料和地方广播站等，用社会主义爱国主义精神和马克思列宁主义精神教育劳动人民。
    由于有效的思想政治工作，劳动人民的觉悟不断增长，他们积极地参加了争取如期完成党和国家提出的任务的斗争。实践证明，哪里的党组织和领导人经常地注意从思想上和政治上武装宣传员和鼓动员，关心对他们的培养，丰富他们的知识，哪里的思想政治工作的效果就会好。
    虽然在对劳动人民的思想政治教育方面取得了很大成就，但是思想政治工作仍然不能完全适应社会主义发展的巨大的政治和经济任务所提出的要求。某些地方还有社会主义社会所不应有的破坏劳动和国家纪律的现象和地方主义的表现。由于某些州的领导人的过错，没有完成其他州的订货，因而打乱了其他州的企业和组织的生产计划。
    思想教育工作是党的一个强有力的武器，应当用战斗的、进攻的精神来进行。应当摧毁地方主义和漠视公共和国家利益的表现，与劳动纪律破坏者、偷懒现象和偷窃行为进行斗争，与资产阶级影响的表现和人们意识中的资本主义残余作斗争。绝不能忘记，对群众的思想政治教育不是一个赶任务的工作，而应当经常结合一切激动人心的国内和国际问题进行。宣传鼓动员根据每一个重要问题积极主动地亲自与人们进行交谈，有着重大的意义。
    党向全国人民提出的新的巨大的任务，责成各级党的领导机构和党组织进一步改进领导政治和教育工作的方式方法，要随时随地帮助鼓动员，用更加系统的知识武装他们，供给他们通俗的教材。这一工作的成就首先取决于对鼓动员的培养上，要使他们善于把他们的报告和谈话与劳动人民的每天的实际工作紧密地结合起来。
    在劳动人民中进行思想政治工作，是各级党的领导机构和党组织以及全党的日常任务。现在，最近三个月以来，工业和建筑部门的鼓动员和整个思想政治工作面临一个十分重要的任务。他们应当鼓起工人、技术人员和工程师的劳动热情，在工人、技术人员和工程师间掀起劳动竞赛，使他们为挖掘完成今年计划规定的一切指标的新的潜力和可能性进行坚决斗争。
    必须在农村——在农业生产合作社、机器拖拉机站和国营农场全力开展群众政治工作。鼓动员应当通过在生产队、生产小队和养畜场的政治工作，动员农村劳动者的力量，更快地收获庄稼，按期完成秋耕和秋种，进一步发展畜牧业。
    这些战斗任务的完成是在缩短的期限内完成五年计划的保证。
