    The Striding Forward of Print Art
    —A Brief Review of the Fourth National Print Exhibition
    Ma Ke
    Artists often compare exhibitions to the harvest season, and indeed, it is an apt metaphor; visiting the "Fourth National Print Exhibition" can bring the joy of a bountiful harvest. This is partly because the exhibition truthfully and poetically reflects the brilliant and inspiring aspects of our socialist construction, and partly because the exhibition comprehensively showcases the vigorous and rapidly advancing state of print art in our country since the Great Leap Forward last year. It is truly a scene of vibrant colors and blossoming talents. In particular, the emergence of a large number of new artists has added a fresh and thriving atmosphere to the field of printmaking.

    The over two hundred and ninety works exhibited this time are all recent creations of printmakers from various regions over the past year. Compared with previous national print exhibitions, not only is the overall level consistent, but the quality of the works has also significantly improved. The subject matter is more extensive, the forms and styles are more diverse, and many printmakers have made further gains in exploring national styles. The content of the works, whether depicting magnificent water conservancy projects, imposing steel production, rapidly changing urban construction, or bountiful harvests with rolling wheat waves and songs filling the fields; whether depicting the magnificent beauty of our great rivers and mountains in the morning, evening, rain, fog, and the unpredictable changes of the four seasons, or the beauty of nature's exotic flowers and plants, all are filled with the artists' love for life and their unique artistic accomplishments. They both inspire and educate, and bring aesthetic enjoyment. We see that the artistic creations of veteran artists are becoming increasingly perfect, and there are also some new explorations and developments. For example, Li Hua's "One Building Rises Upon Another," depicts the rapid development of urban construction in our country with abundant enthusiasm. The composition is rigorous, the knife work is steady and powerful, and the painting is full of refreshing sunshine and empowering pride. Gu Yuan's "New Sprouts" can be called a hymn to the new life of rural children. The conception is ingenious, the artistic conception is fresh, and the knife work is concise and lively, reflecting the new style that the artist has gradually formed in recent years. Huang Yongyu's "Actors of Our Autonomous Prefecture" vividly portrays the beauty and expression of Miao female actors, and also made valuable attempts in learning traditional yang carved lines and color separation. Other works such as Huang Xinbo's "Awakening Peaks" and Liu Kuang's "Spring Dawn" are also original masterpieces. The works of new artists are full of endless creative vitality, shining with dazzling brilliance. For example, Li Huanmin's "Tibetan Girl" and Wu Fan's "Dandelion" both depict innocent and childish images of children, attracting the attention of the audience, and the creative application of traditional woodblock watermark methods strengthens the charm of the works. Xiu Jun's "Autumn," Dong Qizhong's "New Canal Scenery," Xu Kuang's "Waiting for Ferry," Jiang Zhenghong's "New City," Zheng Shuang's "Spring on the Loess Plateau," etc., are also thought-provoking works. The authors reveal the common but often unnoticed beauty in our lives with rich emotions, keen observation, and precise artistic language. Golden and dazzling corn ears hang full in front of mountain farmhouses, clear water flows in the canals crisscrossing the green fields, young male and female surveying team members look forward to the work about to begin on the bow of the boat, and new cities have also been established in remote and primitive forest areas, and people go to work in groups in the spring when flowers are in full bloom... All these are very ordinary life phenomena, but after the artist's artistic creation, they can make us think of the development and construction of the motherland and the peaceful and happy life.

    There are many excellent works in the exhibition, too numerous to mention. However, while admiring them, we cannot help but think about the experiences gained in achieving these achievements and the problems that exist. Here are just a few points: First, the main reason for the great achievements of printmaking is that, encouraged by the general line of the Great Leap Forward, many printmakers went to the mountains and countryside to connect with reality, and boldly created in their creations by liberating their minds. However, due to the varying lengths of time spent in in-depth life, some works are still only stuck in the depiction of superficial phenomena, and have not more deeply reflected the huge changes and struggles in our society (for example, the reflection on people's communes is not enough). Nor has it further portrayed various typical characters in socialist construction. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to go deep into life in order to create more profound works. Second, at present, the subject matter, style and forms of printmaking are becoming increasingly diverse. For example, this exhibition includes single paintings, comic strips, suites of paintings, illustrations, and new stationery, etc. Its forms include circles and squares, vertical and horizontal. Its styles range from elaborate carving to bold strokes, from fresh and lively to simple and rustic, truly rich and colorful. However, we must not regard these as simply tricks of form, but should see that this is determined by the needs of objective reality and the diverse preferences of the masses. Any beautiful form, if separated from life, will be empty and boring; only when combined with life will it be vivid and lively. In order to meet the diverse appreciation preferences of the masses, it is also necessary to increase more varieties and create more styles on the basis of continuing to go deep into life. Third, the ranks of printmakers in our country are expanding rapidly. In 1954, only eighty-five authors participated in the first National Print Exhibition, while this year there are already two hundred participants. What is even more gratifying is that one hundred and fifty-six of them are authors who have grown up since liberation. The printmaking authors of many factories, rural areas, schools, and troops are even more countless, and their creation is surging and forming a hot wave. They have a very high creative drive. If they don't have knives, they make them themselves. If they don't have wooden boards, they find substitutes. Even broken ping-pong paddles have become creative tools. Therefore, the number of works is very large. For example, the Zhanjiang Special District of Guangdong Province held an exhibition of more than three hundred works in one year. This wide range of mass character is a characteristic of the development of art in the socialist era, and it is also the fundamental driving force for the continuous advancement of printmaking. However, the creations of amateur printmakers often lack the basic artistic cultivation, and they have little time for creation and poor learning conditions, so they urgently need support and cultivation. How to mobilize old printmakers to provide guidance through various organizations and methods in order to consolidate the ranks of printmakers is a very important task.

    Our emerging print art, since it was promoted by Mr. Lu Xun, has been nearly thirty years. In these thirty years, especially in the ten years since the founding of the country, it has made great progress. At that time, the woodcut that was still a seedling has now become a shade of green trees, laden with fruit. At that time, the woodcut was only limited to the urban intellectuals, but now it has been popularized among the workers, peasants and soldiers throughout the country, showing a momentum of "autumn floods arrive, and hundreds of rivers pour into the Yellow River." Let our country's print art surge forward in one wave after another!

    阔步前进的版画艺术
    ——简评第四届全国版画展
    马克
    美术家们常常把展览会比做收获的季节，的确是个恰当的比喻；参观“第四届全国版画展览会”就能使人感到丰收的喜悦。这一方面是由于展览会比较真实，而且诗意盎然地反映了我国社会主义建设事业中那些灿烂的、激动人心的种种面貌。另方面也由于这次展览比较全面地显示了我国的版画艺术，自去年大跃进以来蓬勃发展阔步前进的形势。真是万紫千红，群芳争艳。特别是新画家的大批涌现，更给版画园地中增添了一片崭新的、欣欣向荣的气象。
    这次展出的二百九十余件作品，都是各地版画家们近一年的新作。和历届全国版画展相比较，不仅水平整齐，而且作品的质量也有明显的提高。题材内容更加广泛，形式风格也更加多种多样，尤其是许多版画在民族风格的探索上有了进一步的收获。作品描绘的内容不论是宏伟巨大的水利工程，气势巍峨的钢铁生产，日新月异的城市建设，或是麦浪滚翻歌声遍野的丰收；也不论是祖国大好河山晨昏雨雾和四季变化莫测的美妙，或是自然界奇花丽草的美，等等，无不洋溢着画家对生活的热爱，和艺术上独到的造诣。既能使人受到感染和教益，也能令人得到美的享受。我们看到：老画家们的作品其艺术创造日趋完美，而且还有一些新的探索和发展。例如李桦的“一楼盖成一楼又起”，以充沛地热情描画了我国城市建设飞速发展的新貌，构图严谨，刀法稳健有力，画中充满着沁人的阳光和令人自豪的力量。古元的“新芽”，可以说是农村儿童新生活的赞美诗。构思巧妙，意境清新，用刀简洁明快，表现了画家近年来逐渐形成的新风格。黄永玉的“我们自治州的演员”生动地刻划出了苗族女演员的美丽和神情，而且在学习传统的阳刻线条和套色方面，又作了可贵的尝试。其他如黄新波的“岗峦初醒”，刘旷的“春晓”，也都是有独创性的佳作。在新画家们的作品中，更是充满无穷的创作活力，闪射着夺目的光彩。例如李唤民的“藏族女孩”、吴凡的“蒲公英”，都以天真稚气的儿童形象刻划，吸引着观众的注意，传统木板水印方法的创造性运用，更加强了作品的魅惑力。修军的“秋”、董其中的“新渠小景”、徐匡的“待渡”、蒋正鸿的“新城市”、郑爽的“黄土高原的春天”等，也都是耐人寻味的作品。作者以丰富的感情，敏锐的观察力，和确切的艺术语言，揭示了我们生活当中常见的，然而却不容易为人注意的美。金黄耀眼的玉米穗满挂门前的山区农舍，纵横在绿色田野中的渠道里流着淙淙的清水，年轻的男女测量队员们在船头上向往着将要开始的工作，在边远的原始的森林地带也建立了新城市，花儿盛开的春天人们成群结队地去劳动……。所有这些都是很平常的生活现象，然而经过画家的艺术创造，能使我们联想到祖国的发展建设与和平幸福的生活。
    展览会中佳作很多，不胜枚举。不过在赞赏之余，我们不能不想到取得这些成绩的经验和存在的问题。这里只谈几点意见：第一，版画之所以有这样大的成绩，主要是在总路线大跃进的鼓舞下，许多版画家上山下乡联系实际，在创作上解放思想大胆创造的结果。但由于深入生活的时间长短不一，所以有些作品还只停留在表面现象的描绘，而没有更深入地反映出我们社会巨大的变革和斗争（例如对人民公社的反映就不够）。也没有进一步刻划出在社会主义建设中各种典型的人物形象。因此还需要继续深入生活，以便创作出更加深刻的作品。第二，目前，版画的题材样式和形式风格日益多样。像这次展览中就有单幅画、连环画、组画、插图和新笺谱等。其形式有圆有方，有竖有横。其风格有的精雕细刻，有的大刀阔斧，有的清新活泼，有的浑厚古朴，真是丰富多彩。但是决不能把这些视为单纯是形式上变花样，而应看到这是客观实际需要和群众多方面的爱好所决定的。任何美丽的形式如果脱离开生活，将会空虚乏味；只有结合生活才会鲜明生动，为了满足群众多方面的欣赏爱好，也需要在继续深入生活的基础上，增加更多的品种，创造更多的风格。第三，我国版画家的队伍正在迅速扩大，1954年参加第一届全国版画展的作者只有八十五人，而今年参加展览的已有二百人，更可喜的是其中有一百五十六人都是解放后新成长起的作者。许多工厂、农村、学校和部队的版画作者更是难以数计，其创作风起云涌，形成热潮。他们的创作干劲很高，没有刀子自己制造，没有木板就找代用品，甚至坏的乒乓球拍子也变成了创作工具。因此作品的数量很多，例如广东湛江专区，在一年的时间内就举办了一个三百多件作品的展览会。这种广泛的群众性，是社会主义时代艺术发展的特征，也是版画之所以能不断前进的根本动力。但是，业余版画家们的创作往往缺乏艺术的基本修养，而且创作的时间少，学习条件也差，所以亟需扶植和培养。如何发动老版画家，采取各种组织和各种方式进行辅导，以巩固版画家的队伍，这是很重要的工作。
    我国新兴的版画艺术，自鲁迅先生提倡至今已将近三十年了，这三十年中特别是建国十年来，已有了巨大的发展。当时还是幼苗的木刻，现在已绿树成荫，硕果累累。当时仅限于城市知识分子中的木刻，现在已普及全国工农兵群众中去了，大有“秋水时至，百川灌河”之势，让我国的版画艺术一浪高一浪的汹涌前进吧！
