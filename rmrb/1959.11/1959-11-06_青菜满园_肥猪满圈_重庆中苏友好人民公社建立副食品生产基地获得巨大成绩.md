Lush Vegetable Gardens, Plump Pigs in Pens
——The Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune of Chongqing Achieves Great Success in Establishing a Subsidiary Food Production Base
The Rural Work Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

Editor's Note: The Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune in the suburbs of Chongqing has achieved great success in actively establishing a subsidiary food production base, focusing on vegetables and meat and developing a diversified economy. In the year since communization, this commune of more than 29,000 people has solved the problem of vegetable consumption for more than 240,000 people in Jiangbei District, Chongqing, while also being able to transfer more than 100,000 jin of vegetables daily to supply the central urban area. Since October, it has also achieved self-sufficiency in meat for the people of the entire district.

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Commune has many valuable experiences in developing the construction of subsidiary food bases, which can be used as a reference for people's communes in the suburbs of large cities.

The Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune of Chongqing is a commune formed by all the rural areas of Jiangbei District.

Jiangbei District is located on the left bank of the Jialing River and the Yangtze River, across the river from the central urban area of Chongqing. It is a narrow and long suburban area with little land and a large population. Along the river, there is a dense concentration of factories of various sizes. The farmers are accustomed to growing vegetables and raising pigs to supply the city's non-staple food needs. However, until 1956, the vegetables produced by the agricultural cooperatives in the district could only meet 30% of the market demand, and the supply of meat and small poultry was even less than this figure.

After 1957, five agricultural cooperatives in the district developed vegetable production, and the amount of vegetables on the market increased. In 1958, vegetable production surged, 18.9% higher than the great development in 1957; however, the city developed even faster, and it still could not guarantee market needs.

In 1958, the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production brought new changes in the relationship between urban and rural areas. In that year, due to the increase in the industrial population of the district, the ratio of rural population to urban population changed from one to 4.8 in 1950 to one to 7.3; due to the rapid increase in new enterprises and factories, the cultivated land area decreased by more than 20,000 mu compared with 1950, almost one mu less per agricultural population; moreover, with the great leap forward in production, the demand for subsidiary foods in both urban and rural areas increased. The market sales volume expanded unprecedentedly, while the amount of subsidiary foods that neighboring counties and districts supported Chongqing City was sharply reduced. This rapidly developing objective situation put forward a new topic for Jiangbei District to develop a diversified economy based on vegetables and meat, that is, not only to ensure self-sufficiency in subsidiary foods in the district, but also to support the central urban area with some products.

In September 1958, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Commune was established. The entire commune allocated 18,400 mu of land as a vegetable base; each production team established small pig farms, and the commune established six large-scale breeding farms; in addition to decentralized feeding of poultry, twenty-three poultry farms were established. In just one year, the commune has made great achievements in subsidiary food production.

Looking at the situation in 1959, from January to August, in the case of more than 70 days without heavy rain, the commune's vegetable market supply reached more than 44.25 million jin, a substantial increase compared with the same period last year; the number of live pigs reached more than 38,700, more than double the same period last year. The output of poultry and aquatic products has also increased several times compared with the total output in 1958.

With the development of vegetable production in the commune, the problem of vegetable self-sufficiency in the district has been solved. In the peak season, each person has an average of 1.14 jin of fresh vegetables per day, and in the off-season, it can also be guaranteed that each person eats more than one jin of vegetables per day; not only is the entire district self-sufficient, but also more than 100,000 jin of vegetables are transferred daily to support the central urban area, and a complete variety of colors and varieties is often maintained. In April and May this year, the commune produced 13.79 million jin of vegetables, 309% of the output in the same period in 1958. At the same time, the vegetables that could not be sold for a while were processed into pickles, which eased the vegetable supply situation during the severe drought this year.

Due to the doubling of live pigs, the commune overfulfilled the state's annual purchase task by the end of June this year. The pigs raised by the commune are numerous, each one is fat and strong. From January to August this year, 6,763 sows were cultivated, four times that of the same period last year. In October this year, the entire district has achieved self-sufficiency in meat.

The development of vegetable and pig production has also promoted grain production. This year, the per mu yield of wheat in the entire commune increased by 16% compared with last year.

How to Build a Base

In the process of building a subsidiary food base, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Commune first focused on the base construction of vegetables and live pigs, which have the largest urban consumption. The specific methods are:

(1) The conditions for establishing a vegetable base are: ① there is water conservancy irrigation; ② there is sufficient fertilizer; ③ it is close to roads and riverbanks, which is convenient for transportation; ④ the land is in pieces, which is convenient for centralized production; ⑤ the production unit must have a certain amount of production experience. According to these conditions, the sown area of vegetables has been expanded from the original 11,700 mu to 18,400 mu, an increase of 56.4%; 845 kilns, 220 hotbeds, and 45 glass greenhouses have been built, 38 ponds and weirs and 4 pumping stations have been built, and the irrigation area has reached more than 11,000 mu.

(2) In the base construction of pigpens and poultry farms, on the one hand, rely on professional teams to centrally build large-scale breeding sites, on the other hand, implement the policy of "combining centralization and decentralization, combining large, medium and small," and mobilize production teams to build medium and small breeding farms on the spot, so the number of live pigs has developed rapidly. As of the end of August this year, the commune has built two large pig farms with a capacity of more than 1,000 pigs each, six large pigpens with a capacity of more than 500 pigs each, and each production team has also built 1,331 large and small pigpens, which can accommodate more than 9,900 pigs; there are 23 centralized breeding poultry farms. The advantage of establishing a breeding farm is that it is convenient for breeding demonstrations, scientific management and technological reforms, and it is convenient to meet the needs of centralized listing in cities; the advantage of decentralized feeding is that the quantity is large, the development is fast, and it is easy to prevent and control diseases, and the two complement each other. Large breeding farms are not only large in scale and raise a lot of animals, but also can establish new-style equipment and a series of subsidiary institutions around large-scale breeding. For example, the Wulidian Livestock Farm has set up semi-mechanized equipment such as earth railways, earth tap water, electric grinders, and feed slicers in the pig farm. Around it, there are also special feed bases, artificial insemination stations, veterinary hospitals, veterinary drug factories, feed processing factories, and a scientific research station with modern equipment such as refrigerators, high-powered microscopes, electric incubators, complete sets of medical equipment, pharmaceutical equipment, and artificial insemination devices. The construction of such a base, in terms of scale and equipment, is difficult for agricultural cooperatives to do in the past.

(3) Implement unified planning and combined development of various bases, mainly with vegetable and live pig bases. The combination of vegetable and pig base production has largely solved the two major problems that advanced cooperatives often worried about: fertilizer and feed. About three mu of vegetable foot leaves can supply feed for one pig, and the manure from three pigs can supply fertilizer for one mu of land. This commune has achieved 1.1 pigs per mu. These two bases not only promote each other in terms of output, but also save funds and transportation labor. For example, the Mahuangliang Production Team was originally a poor team with barren land, but due to the establishment of a base, the number of live pigs increased from 405 last year to 990, and the vegetable planting area expanded from 180 mu to 225 mu. The two promoted each other. The breeding aspect saved the labor force of three loads of feed, and the vegetable aspect saved the labor force of 47 loads of fertilizer. The output has greatly increased. Despite the severe drought this year, the average yield per mu of vegetables in the team from January to August increased by 50% compared with last year, and the total output was equal to 115% of the total output last year.

In order to meet the diverse needs of urban and rural people for subsidiary foods, under the principle of "taking vegetables and live pigs as the key link and developing a diversified economy in an all-round way," the commune has made unified plans for the commune’s 95 mountains and 4 streams. It has used the mountainous areas to build 6 ten-thousand-chicken mountains and a medicinal material planting area, and has developed orchards, established nurseries, raised dairy cows and dairy goats, raised fish, raised bees, raised rabbits, raised snakes, and even cultivated flowers and potted plants in accordance with local conditions.

In order to vigorously increase the land utilization rate, on the basis of consolidating the base, the commune is now further implementing the method of intercropping and interplanting vegetables and grains to increase the multiple cropping index, increase the planting area, and increase the yield per unit area. The commune plans to achieve a vegetable multiple cropping index of six times and a grain multiple cropping index of 4.88 times next year, and strive to achieve self-sufficiency in grain throughout the year. Now, driven by the two major bases of vegetables and live pigs, all aspects of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery in the entire commune have shown a situation of flourishing and advancing side by side. The development of Wanji Mountain has not only reproduced tens of thousands of fine varieties, but also supplied a large number of breeding chickens to commune members and various organs, enterprises, schools, and residents in the district; each mountain has planted 9.3 million seedlings of fruits such as peaches, plums, coffee, lemons, navel oranges, and seedless tangerines, as well as fragrant crops such as jasmine and fragrant leaves. 1.92 million fish were stocked in the water surface of the entire commune that can raise fish. The development of these diversified economies, some of which have already achieved great results, has not only increased the income of the commune, but also met the diverse needs of the city.

(4) Implement the policy of self-breeding and self-raising to solve the problem of seed sources for production development. The problem of seed sources has never been solved in advanced cooperatives. Most of the vegetable seeds and pig breeds have to be bought from other places. Buying seeds from other places cannot guarantee the quantity, quality, and timely planting. After the commune has a base, these problems have been basically solved. According to the policy of self-breeding and self-raising, large pig farms focus on breeding breeding livestock, and each production team also has special personnel to manage seed storage and seedling cultivation. In this year, the commune also introduced more than 100 new varieties of vegetables and livestock from other places, and basically achieved the breeding of live pigs and vegetables with good varieties. The large varieties of vegetables in 1957 were only 12, but this year it has increased to 42. Because it has its own sufficient seed reserves, it encountered severe droughts in August and September this year, and vegetables were repeatedly dried to death, but the commune still had enough seeds to replant again. In addition, it also sold more than 10,000 jin of vegetable seeds to support brother communes. Self-sufficiency in seed sources and breeding of live pigs and vegetables has also helped solve the problem of disease prevention and control. In the past, agricultural cooperatives had to import piglets from other places, which inevitably purchased sick pigs and caused infection.

(5) Implement the production management responsibility system to improve management quality. After the establishment of the vegetable base, the commune gradually promoted the "six determinations and two awards" system according to the instructions of the municipal party committee, that is, determining leaders, determining labor force, determining land plots, determining indicators, determining measures, and determining time, and implementing bonuses for exceeding quotas and creating inventions. At present, in each vegetable professional team, there are team and group leaders who are in charge of production, and guarantee that 70% of the labor force often strengthens field management.

In terms of feeding management, each pig farm has now achieved "five raisings and four locals." "Five raisings" means mainly public raising, mainly self-breeding and self-raising, mainly coarse feed, mainly centralized raising, and mainly high-speed fattening; "four locals" means building farms locally, raising pigs locally, supplying locally, and accumulating fertilizer locally. At the same time, piglets are also raised in groups, feed bases are established, strict management systems are established, and a bonus system of fixed quotas, fixed quality, and fixed costs is implemented (50% of the overproduction is awarded to the feeders, and 30% of the underproduction is appropriately compensated).

(6) Realize the irrigation and water conservancy of the base and the transportation of vehicles and ships. In order to absorb the drought resistance experience this year, the commune decided to implement the principle of combining lifting and storage, combining local and foreign, and combining large, medium, and small, on the basis of having established a certain number of pumping stations. It is now planned to build eight pumping stations, repair and expand 21 ponds, reservoirs, and river dams, build 37 ponds, reservoirs, and river dams, store water in 562 mu of rice fields, and open canals of 3,400 meters, and the self-flowing water conservancy will reach 5.9835 million cubic meters, ensuring that the needs are met and will no longer be threatened by drought. At the same time, according to the seasonal characteristics, combined with the labor and material resources, the steps will be taken in a comprehensive plan, focusing on key points, prioritizing the important over the less important, prioritizing the urgent over the slow, and carrying out in batches. In October, 10% of the agricultural labor force will be used to fully utilize the existing 2.913 million cubic meters of water equipment through repairs, and complete the task of 562 mu of water storage rice fields. For key projects, fix professional teams, prepare for work, and use 30% of the labor force to carry out blitzkriegs from November to February 1960, fight for 100 days, and realize farmland water conservancy ahead of schedule.

In order to fully implement the simultaneous development of vegetables, grains, and meat, the key lies in high yield. In this way, the shortage of labor becomes more prominent. In order to solve the shortage of labor, the commune is currently vigorously developing transportation, and striving to achieve trunk lines for large teams and convenient roads for each team before the end of the year; at the same time, each production team is equipped with a bullock cart to realize the transportation of vehicles and ships, and the carts are basically bullock-drawn rubber tires.

Continuing Leap Forward

With the development of commodity production, the income of the commune and its members has greatly increased. From January to August this year, the total production income of the commune reached more than 3.42 million yuan, exceeding 54.9% of the same period last year.

With the increase in the commune's economic strength, the work of culture, education, health, and collective welfare has also greatly developed.

From January to July this year, the commune paid more than 1.5 million yuan in wages and supplies to commune members, an increase of 23.17% compared with the distribution of commune members in the entire district in the same period last year. From January to July 1958, the average income per farmer was 187 yuan, while in the same period this year, the average income per household was 230 yuan, an increase of 23%. There are no more overspending households, loan households, or relief households, which originally accounted for 21.3% of the rural population.

The members here are not satisfied with the great achievements of the past year, and they are still working hard towards higher goals. The commune's diversified economic bases are still under construction. Especially after successfully overcoming the drought, there has been a vigorous and enthusiastic construction upsurge centered on water conservancy. The livestock base is also accelerating its expansion. In Wulidian alone, four large pigpens with a capacity of 1,000 to 3,000 pigs each will be newly built, and a ten-thousand-pig farm with modern scientific equipment will be built next year. Around each base, subsidiary institutions such as breeding farms, breeding, disease prevention, and feed processing are being established separately, as well as small factories for manufacturing local chemical fertilizers and local pesticides. By next year, each base will basically achieve vehicle transportation, self-flowing irrigation water, and scientific management of feed.

    青菜满园　肥猪满圈
    ——重庆中苏友好人民公社建立副食品生产基地获得巨大成绩
    中共重庆市委农村工作部
    编者按：重庆市郊中苏友好人民公社以蔬菜肉食为主发展多种经济，积极建立副食品生产基地，取得了巨大的成绩。公社化一年来，这个二万九千多人口的公社，已经解决了重庆市江北区二十四万多人口的吃菜问题，同时每天还能调出十多万斤蔬菜供应市中心区；从10月份开始，又做到了全区人民肉食自给。
    中苏友好公社在发展副食品基地的建设工作中有许多宝贵的经验，可供大城市郊区人民公社参考。
    重庆市中苏友好人民公社，是江北区全区农村组成的一个公社。
    江北区位于嘉陵江和长江的左岸，和重庆市中心区隔江相望，是一个地势狭长、地少人多、沿江一带密集着大小工厂的近郊区。全区现有人口二十四万二千多人，其中农村人口二万九千多人，耕地五万四千亩，农民习惯种菜养猪，以供应城市副食品需要。但是一直到1956年，全区各农业社生产的蔬菜只能满足市场需要量的30％，肉食和小家禽的供应量比这个数字还小。
    1957年以后，全区五个农业社发展了蔬菜生产，上市量有了提高。1958年，蔬菜产量激增比大发展的1957年高出18.9％；但是城市发展更快，仍不能保证市场需要。
    1958年工农业生产大跃进，在城乡关系上又发生了新的变化。这一年由于全区工业人口的增加，使农村人口和城市人口的比例由1950年的一比四点八，变为一比七点三；由于新企业和新工厂的迅速增加，又使得耕地面积较1950年减少了二万多亩，几乎每个农业人口少了一亩地；而且随着生产大跃进，城乡两处对副食品的需要量也都增加了。市场的销售量空前扩大，而邻近县区支援重庆市副食品的数量却又急剧减少。这种飞跃发展的客观形势，就给江北区发展以菜、肉为主的多种经济生产提出了个新课题，即不仅要保证本区的副食品自给，还要以部分产品支援市中心区。
    1958年9月，中苏友好公社建立了。全公社以一万八千四百亩土地辟为蔬菜基地；各生产队都建立了小型猪场，公社又建立了六个大型饲养场；家禽除分散喂养外，又建立了二十三个养禽场。仅仅一年的时间，公社在副食品生产上已经做出了巨大成绩。
    以1959年的情况看，在今年七十多天未下透雨的情况下，1至8月，公社的蔬菜上市量达四千四百二十五万多斤，比去年同期蔬菜的上市量大大增加；生猪达到三万八千七百多头，比去年同期翻了一倍多。家禽、水产等也都比1958年全年产量成倍增长。
    在公社蔬菜生产发展的情况下，全区蔬菜自给问题得到了解决。旺季每人每天平均有一斤十四两鲜菜，淡季也能保证每人每天吃菜一斤以上；不仅做到全区自给，而且每天还调出十多万斤蔬菜支援市中心区，经常保持花色品种齐全。今年4、5月，公社生产了蔬菜一千三百七十九万斤，为1958年同期产量的309％。同时把一时推销不完的蔬菜加工做成咸菜，缓和了今年严重干旱时的蔬菜供应状况。
    由于生猪的成倍增长，今年6月底，这个公社就超额完成了国家派购的全年任务。公社养的猪多，个个膘肥体壮，今年1至8月培育的母猪就达六千七百六十三头，为去年同期的四倍。今年10月份，全区肉食已经做到自给。
    蔬菜、生猪生产的发展，也促进了粮食增产，今年全社小麦亩产量比去年增加16％。
    怎样建设基地
    中苏友好公社在建设副食品基地的过程中，首先抓紧城市消费量最大的蔬菜和生猪的基地建设。具体的作法是：
    （一）建立蔬菜基地的条件是：①有水利灌溉；②肥源充足；③靠近公路、河岸，便于运输；④土地成片便于集中生产；⑤生产单位要有一定的生产经验。根据这些条件，蔬菜的播种面积就由原来的一万一千七百多亩，扩大为一万八千四百亩，增加56.4％；建立了八百四十五个火窑，二百二十个温床和四十五幢玻璃温室，兴修了三十八口塘堰，四处抽水机站，灌溉面积达到一万一千多亩。
    （二）在猪圈、禽场的基地建设上，一面依靠专业队伍集中修建大群饲养场所，一面贯彻“集中与分散结合、大中小并举”的方针，发动各生产队就地取材，兴修中小型饲养场，生猪头数因此发展很快。截至今年8月底止，公社共修了可容猪千头以上的大猪场二处，五百头以上的大猪圈六处，各生产队也分别修了大小猪圈一千三百三十一间，可容猪九千九百多头；集中饲养的禽场有二十三处。建立饲养场的好处是便于育种示范，进行科学管理和技术改革，便于满足城市集中上市的需要；而分散喂养的好处则是数量多，发展快，便于防治疫病，两者相辅相成。大的饲养场，不只是规模大，养得多，而且围绕着大群饲养，还可建立新式设备和一系列的附属机构。如五里店畜牧场，在猪场内设置了土铁轨，土自来水，电动磨、饲料切片机、饲料搅拌机等半机械化设备，在它周围还有专门的饲料基地、人工授精站、兽医院、兽药厂、饲料加工厂，以及为它服务的拥有电冰箱、高倍显微镜、电孵箱、成套的医疗器材、制药用具、人工授精器等现代化设备的科学研究站。这样的基地建设，就其规模、设备来讲，都是过去农业社所难以办到的。
    （三）以蔬菜、生猪基地为主实行各种基地统一规划，结合发展。菜、猪基地生产相结合，就相当程度地解决了高级社时常常焦愁的两大难题：肥料和饲料。大约三亩地的菜脚叶可以供一头猪的饲料，三头猪的粪水可供一亩地施肥，这个社已经做到每亩地有猪一点一头。这两个基地不仅在产量上互相促进，还节约了资金和运输劳动力。如蚂蝗梁生产队原是个土地贫瘠的穷队，但由于建立了基地，生猪由去年四百零五头发展到九百九十头，蔬菜种植面积由一百八十亩扩为二百二十五亩，两者互相促进，饲养方面节约了三个担饲料的劳动力，蔬菜方面又节约了四十七个运肥料的劳动力，产量却大大地提高了。尽管今年严重干旱，这个队1至8月的蔬菜平均亩产量较去年增加了50％，总产量等于去年全年产量的115％。
    为了满足城乡人民对副食品多种多样的需要，公社在“蔬菜生猪为纲，多种经济全面发展”的方针下，对全社九十五个山头、四条溪流统一作了规划，利用山区兴建了六个万鸡山和一个药料种植区，并因地制宜发展了果园，建立了苗圃，养了奶牛、奶羊，养鱼、养蜂、养兔、养蛇乃至培植鲜花、盆景。
    为了大力提高土地利用率，在巩固基地的基础上，现在公社又进一步实行了菜粮间种套种办法，以提高复种指数，增加种植面积，提高单位面积产量。全公社明年计划蔬菜复种指数达到六次，粮食达到四点八八次，争取全年粮食自给。现在，在蔬菜、生猪两大基地带动下，全公社农林牧副渔各方面都出现了百业俱兴，齐头并进的局面。万鸡山的发展不仅繁殖了上万只的良种，并对社员和区里各机关、企业、学校、居民供给了大量的种鸡；各个山头已分别种下了桃、李、咖啡、柠檬、脐橙、无核桔等果苗九百三十万株，以及茉莉、香叶等香料作物。全社可养鱼的水面放养了鱼一百九十二万尾。这些多种经济的发展，有的已经收到了很大效果，不仅给社里增加了收入，也满足了城市的多种需要。
    （四）贯彻自繁自养方针，为生产发展解决了种源问题。种源问题，在高级社时总是没有能得到解决，无论菜种和猪种大部要依靠到外地去买，向外地买种，就不能保证产量、质量和及时下种。公社有了基地后，这些问题基本上解决了。根据自繁自养方针，大型猪场着重繁殖种畜，各生产队也有专人管理蓄种、育苗工作。公社在这一年中，还从外地引进了一百多种蔬菜和牲畜新品种，基本上做到了生猪和蔬菜的良种化。蔬菜的大宗品种在1957年才十二种，今年就增多到四十二种。由于自己有了充分的种子储备，今年8、9月遇到严重的干旱，种菜一次又一次地被晒死，可是公社仍有足够的种子再次进行抢播。此外，还出卖了一万多斤菜种支援兄弟公社。生猪和蔬菜的种源自给和良种化，也帮助解决了疾病防治问题。从前农业社因要从外地引进猪仔，这就难免购入病猪，引起传染。
    （五）实行生产管理责任制，提高管理质量。公社在蔬菜基地建立后，即根据市委指示，逐步推行了“六定、两奖”制度，即定领导、定劳动力、定地块、定指标、定措施、定时间，并实行超额超值及创造发明奖励。现在，在各个蔬菜专业队里，均有队、组长专管生产，并保证了70％的劳动力经常加强田间管理。
    各养猪场在饲养管理方面，目前均已做到“五养、四就”。“五养”即以公养为主，自繁自养为主，粗饲料为主，集中饲养为主，高速催肥为主；“四就”即就地建场，就地养猪，就地供应，就地积肥。同时，对猪仔也实行了分群饲养，建立了饲料基地，建立了严格的管理制度，实行了定额、定质和定成本的奖励制度（超产部分按50％奖给饲养员，减产部分按30％酌情赔偿）。
    （六）实现基地灌溉水利化，运输车船化。公社为了吸取今年抗旱经验，在已经建立一定数量的提水站的基础上，根据全区断头山多，溪河少而小的特点，决定贯彻提蓄并举，土洋并举，大中小相结合的方针。现计划兴修提水站八处，修补扩建塘库拦河坝二十一处，兴修塘库拦河坝三十七处，囤水田五百六十二亩，开渠三千四百米，水利自流化达五百九十八点三五万公方，保证满足需要，不再受旱灾威胁。同时根据季节性特点，结合劳力、物力情况，在步骤上采取全面规划，重点突击，先重后轻，先急后缓，分批进行。在10月份以10％的农业劳动力将现有的二百九十一点三万公方水的设备，通过整修全部利用起来，并完成五百六十二亩囤水田的任务。对重点工程，固定专业队伍，作好准备工作，11月至1960年2月以30％的劳动力进行突击，大战一百天，提前实现农田水利化。
    为了全面贯彻菜粮肉并举，关键在于高产。这样，劳动力的紧张，就显得比较突出。为了解决劳动力的不足，目前公社正在大搞交通运输，力争年前作到大队有干线，队队有便道；同时，每个生产队配备牛拉车一辆，实现运输车船化，车子基本牛拉胶轮化。
    继续跃进
    商品生产的发展，公社和社员的收入大大增加了。今年1至8月，公社的生产总收入达三百四十二万多元，超过去年同期的54.9％。
    随着公社经济力量的上升，文教卫生工作和集体福利事业也都有了大发展。
    今年1至7月，全社发给社员的工资和供给部分就有一百五十余万元，比去年同期全区社员的分配数提高23.17％。1958年1至7月，每个农户平均收入为一百八十七元，今年同期每户平均收入却为二百三十元，增长23％。原来占农村人口21.3％的超支户、贷款户、救济户，再也没有了。
    这里的社员们并不满足一年来的巨大成绩，他们还在朝更高的目标努力。公社的多种经济基地还在继续建设，特别在胜利渡过干旱以后，出现了一个以搞水利为中心的蓬蓬勃勃、热火朝天的建设高潮。畜牧基地也在加速扩修。只是五里店一处，就将新修可容一千到三千头猪的大猪圈四栋，要在明年建成一个有着现代科学设备的万猪场。围绕着各个基地，到处还在分别建立良种场、繁育、防病、饲料加工等附属机构和制造土化肥、土农药的小工场。到明年，各个基地将基本上做到交通运输车子化，灌溉用水自流化，管理饲料科学化。
