Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 18th: The “National Movement Liaison Council for Resolving the Okinawa Issue” in Japan today passed a resolution opposing the U.S. military's testing of "Nike" missiles on Okinawa Island and demanding that the Japanese government negotiate with the United States to immediately stop the test.

The resolution was made at a meeting of the Liaison Council held in the House of Representatives. Representatives from ten organizations attended the meeting, including the Japan Socialist Party, the Japanese Communist Party, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the National Federation of Farmers' Associations, the Japan Peace Committee, the Japan Youth League Council, and the All-Japan Federation of Student Autonomy Associations.

The Liaison Council emphasized that the "Nike" missile is a dangerous atomic weapon capable of being equipped with nuclear warheads. Testing this weapon may intensify international tensions.

The meeting also pointed out that the people of Okinawa Island are carrying out movements to stop the missile test through strikes and hunger strikes. Navigation and fishing activities in the Japanese mainland are also restricted, and the fisheries industry in Kagoshima has suffered huge losses.

The Liaison Council decided to dispatch protest ships to the test site to oppose the U.S. testing of "Nike" missiles; hold a national convention to launch a broad mass protest movement. The Liaison Council decided that they will persist in the struggle until the United States stops the missile test.

After the meeting, representatives of various groups submitted a resolution opposing the missile test to the U.S. Embassy. The resolution also demanded the abolition of U.S. nuclear weapons bases on Okinawa Island and the return of Okinawa Island to Japan.

The representatives also submitted protest letters to Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, and the "Defense Agency," opposing the visit of Keizo Hayashi, Chairman of the Joint Staff Council of the "Defense Agency," to Okinawa Island to observe the U.S. missile test, and opposing the government's plan to allow the Japanese army to participate in the U.S. missile test.
