Xinhua News Agency, November 18th, Washington dispatch: After Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on November 7th regarding the Sino-Indian border issue, the U.S. ruling group, greatly fearing the significant impact of China's important initiative to ease the Sino-Indian border situation, immediately mobilized their propaganda machine to vigorously attack the Chinese proposal and incite India to reject it. At the same time, U.S. officials and newspapers continued to exploit the Sino-Indian border issue, provoking relations between India and China, even suggesting that India "take strong military measures" on the border in order to create and maintain tension. Some newspapers are increasingly blatantly demanding that India change its neutral foreign policy.

U.S. Secretary of State Herter, when talking about the so-called McMahon Line at a press conference on November 12th, said, "I don't know that we ever supported this line. I just think it's always been a hypothetical line, I think it's been published on maps, but I don't think it's ever been raised for discussion or been questioned before." He attacked China for "using force" on the Sino-Indian border and, on the 13th, summoned the Indian Chargé d'affaires, expressing the United States' "great sympathy" for India's "intentions" in the Sino-Indian border dispute. Herter also accused China of "blatantly disregarding normal international procedures" and "taking aggressive armed actions, including the killing of Indian policemen, apparently attempting to establish a de facto position of strength in its relations with India."

The "New York Times," "New York Herald Tribune," and others have recently published editorials one after another, viciously slandering Premier Zhou's letter, demanding that India adopt a "tough stance." The "New York Times" emphasized that India cannot "place trust" in China's proposal. This newspaper demanded that India must "take a cautious approach" and that Nehru should not "hesitate" in adopting a "tough stance." The "New York Times" reporter, in a dispatch from Washington, even openly incited India to "take armed action to force the Communist Chinese to withdraw" from "positions that India considers to be Indian territory" on the Sino-Indian border. The "New York Herald Tribune" editorial acknowledged that successive Chinese governments "have never accepted the McMahon Line" and that "the legal status of the border between Tibet and India is a question," but it also accused China of having "taken" Indian territory "from India by force," clamoring that India "cannot accept" China's new proposal and that India should "take strong military measures" on the border. The "Washington Post" and the "Christian Science Monitor" also had to admit that Premier Zhou's letter was "conciliatory," but then devoted a large amount of space to distorting the meaning of the Chinese proposal, saying that India should not "feel satisfied" and should "give China a resolute counterattack."

U.S. newspapers, keen on provoking relations between India and China, lavishly praised U.S. President Eisenhower's announcement that he would visit India in December and promoted that Eisenhower would intervene in the Sino-Indian border incident. The "New York Times" Washington correspondent reported that Washington "diplomats and American officials strongly feel that the President's visit to India will probably be the most important part of this trip. The dispute between India and Communist China caused by border disputes has increased the importance of the President's decision to visit New Delhi." "Newsweek" said, "The President is taking advantage of this opportunity" to go to India to "discuss 'common defense' issues." The "Christian Science Monitor" also believed that Eisenhower in New Delhi "may further discuss ways of (Pakistan and India) common defense." The November 9th issue of "Newsweek" also specifically published an article stating that the United States "has a specific right to encourage India and Pakistan to move towards the goal of joint defense of the subcontinent." This article also clarified the nature of this "joint defense": "If Pakistan continues to be protected by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Central Treaty Organization, and its bilateral agreements with the United States," "then India, as Pakistan's military ally, would also be protected."

Some American newspapers, while frantically fanning the flames on the Sino-Indian border dispute issue, bluntly revealed the U.S. conspiracy: to change India's neutral foreign policy and ultimately pull it into the Western military blocs. The "American Paper" wrote that India should recognize that "neutralism is useless," which would be "beneficial to them and the free world." "U.S. News & World Report" also clamored "neutralism is finished." The "New York Herald Tribune" said that if Nehru "realizes that his neutralism has failed, he will lean towards the anti-communist bloc in Asia."

    阴谋制造紧张局势从中渔利
    美国煽动印度拒绝我国建议
    反动报刊公开叫嚷要把印度拉进西方军事集团
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：在周恩来总理11月7日就中印边界问题给印度总理尼赫鲁的信发表以后，美国统治集团十分害怕中国关于缓和中印边境局势的重要创议所产生的巨大影响，立即开动他们的宣传机器大肆攻击中国建议，煽动印度拒绝这个建议。同时，美国官方人士和报刊继续竭力利用中印边界问题，挑拨印度同中国的关系，甚至建议印度在边境“采取强有力的军事措施”，以便制造和保持紧张局势。有些报刊越来越露骨地要求印度改变中立外交政策。
    美国国务卿赫脱11月12日在记者招待会上谈到所谓麦克马洪线时说，“我不知道我们曾经支持过这条线。我只是认为这一直是一条假定的线，我认为这条线在地图上发表过，但是我认为它以前从来没有被提出讨论过或被怀疑过。”他攻击中国在中印边境“使用了武力”，13日又召见印度代办，表示美国“非常同情”印度在中印边境争端上的“意图”。赫脱并且诬蔑中国“悍然蔑视正常的国际程序”，“采取了包括杀害印度警察在内的侵略性的武装行动，显然企图在同印度的关系方面建立一种事实上的实力地位”。
    “纽约时报”、“纽约先驱论坛报”等最近接连发表社论，对周总理信件进行恶毒的诬蔑，要印度采取“强硬态度”。“纽约时报”强调印度对中国建议不能“寄予信任”。这家报纸要求印度必须“采取小心谨慎的态度”，尼赫鲁在采取“强硬态度”上不要“犹豫不决”。“纽约时报”记者从华盛顿发出的报道里，甚至公然煽动印度在中印边境“采取武装行动来迫使共产党中国人退出”“印度认为是印度领土的阵地”。“纽约先驱论坛报”的社论里承认历来的中国政府“一直没有接受麦克马洪线”，“西藏和印度之间的边界的法律地位是一个疑问”，然而它又诬蔑中国已经“用武力从印度夺去”印度的领土，叫嚷印度“不能接受”中国的新建议，印度应该在边境“采取强有力的军事措施”。“华盛顿邮报”和“基督教科学箴言报”也都不能不承认周总理信件是“和解的”，但又以大量篇幅来歪曲中国建议的意义，要印度不能“感到满意”，应对中国“给予坚决的反击”。
    热中于挑拨印度同中国关系的美国报刊，对美国总统艾森豪威尔宣布将在12月访问印度一举大肆称赞，并且宣传艾森豪威尔将插手中印边境事件。“纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者报道，华盛顿“外交人士和美国的官员们都强烈感到，总统到印度去的访问恐怕将是这次旅行中最重要的部分。印度同共产党中国由于边界地区纠纷而引起的争吵，增加了总统决定去访问新德里的重要意义”。“新闻周刊”说，“总统正好利用这个机会”到印度去“讨论‘共同防御’问题”。“基督教科学箴言报”也认为艾森豪威尔在新德里“可能进一步讨论（巴基斯坦同印度）共同防御的办法”。11月9日一期“新闻周刊”还专门刊载了一篇文章说，美国“有一种特定权利来鼓励印度和巴基斯坦朝着联合防御这个次大陆的目标前进”。这篇文章并且阐明了这种“联合防御”的性质：“如果巴基斯坦继续受到东南亚条约组织、中央条约组织以及它和美国的双边协定的保护的话”，“那么印度作为巴基斯坦的军事同盟国，就也会受到保护”。
    有些美国报刊在中印边界纠纷问题上拼命煽风点火的同时，直言不讳地道出了美国的阴谋：要改变印度的中立外交政策，最后把它拉进西方军事集团。“美国人报”写道，印度应该承认“中立主义是无用的”，这样会“对于他们和自由世界有利”。“美国新闻与世界报道”也叫嚷“中立主义完蛋”。“纽约先驱论坛报”说，要使得尼赫鲁“认识到他的中立主义已告失败，他将会倒向亚洲的反共集团”。
