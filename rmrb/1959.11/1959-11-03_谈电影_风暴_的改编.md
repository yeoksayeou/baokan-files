The stage play "Red Storm" is a good play, and "The Storm," adapted from it, is also a good film. The two truly have their own merits. Adapting a successful novel or drama into a film does not guarantee a good film. Sometimes, it can even be the opposite. Adapting one art form into another is not a simple story transplant but another serious artistic creation. The films "Blessing" and "Lin's Shop," adapted from the novels of the same name, are brilliant examples of adaptation work and deserve praise. "The Storm" provides a successful experience in adapting from a stage play.

Adaptation work indeed has its unique difficulties. It must be faithful to the original work but also be creative. Some who have seen the stage play say "The Storm" is not as good as "Red Storm"; others who have seen the film first say "Red Storm" is not as good as the film. Neither is fair nor accurate. I say "Red Storm" and "The Storm" are both good, but that does not mean they are both perfect. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. But their successes and failures should be measured based on the characteristics of the different art forms of drama and film, and their achievements in ideology and artistry should be evaluated separately. One cannot mechanically use the achievements gained in one form to measure the work of another form. For example, in "Red Storm," Shi Yang has several inspiring speeches, which are all good scenes, but one cannot simply say that the film is not as good as the stage play because the film "The Storm" does not have these scenes.

However, since "The Storm" is adapted from a stage play and is from the same screenwriter and director, it would be interesting and beneficial to compare the similarities and differences between the stage play and the film and to compare their respective gains and losses. But such a good topic awaits experts to write about, and I can only share a few thoughts on the adaptation work.

Both works depict the historical facts of the February 7th Great Strike, with the same main characters and roughly the same main plot. The theme that the author attempts to express is also exactly the same. The February 7th Great Strike—the Beijing-Hankou Railway Great Strike—was the first bloody political struggle led by the Chinese Communist Party after its founding and carried out by the Chinese working class, and was the "last angry wave of the first wave of strikes in China" that began in January 1922. This strike was not an economic struggle against a particular capitalist but a political struggle against the imperialists and their running dogs, the feudal warlords, who cruelly ruled the Chinese people. The main significance of this struggle is: on the one hand, it demonstrated the strong, courageous, and self-sacrificing noble qualities of the Chinese working class; through the fact that Communist Party members Lin Xiangqian and Shi Yang and other comrades were loyal and unyielding and dedicated their precious lives to the working class, it further proved to the people of the whole country that only the Chinese Communist Party is the leader of the Chinese revolution and the savior of the Chinese people. On the other hand, it also fully exposed the hideous faces of imperialism and the warlord Wu Peifu and the inside story of their collusion. This pointed out a bright path for the Chinese people: to survive and to make revolution, they can only overthrow the joint rule of imperialism and the feudal warlords under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The authors of the stage play "Red Storm" and the film "The Storm" understand this significance. This is the basic reason for the success of these two works and the most important similarity between them.

However, the artistic treatment of these two works, which have the same theme and roughly the same characters and plot, is different by the screenwriter and director. The stage play is divided into three acts and seven scenes, but the main scenes are concentrated in four scenes: the second scene of the first act, where Lin Xiangqian and Shi Yang expose Wei Xueqing's conspiracy to use gangs to create contradictions among the workers; the second scene of the second act, the most intense struggle between Shi Yang, Lin Xiangqian, and Bai Jianwu in front of the Pule Theater; the first scene of the third act, where Lin Xiangqian is ambushed and arrested on the night of February 7th; and the second scene of the same act, where Lin Xiangqian dies generously. These four major sections are the four pillars of the stage play. In the film, it is divided into six major sections (the literary script is divided into seven sections, but the sixth section is deleted in the film). The main scenes are also concentrated in four scenes: first, the struggle of the flatcar incident; second, the struggle to hold the founding meeting at the Pule Theater; third, the Great Strike; fourth, from the grand parade to the February 7th Massacre, to the arrest and martyrdom of Lin Xiangqian and Shi Yang. All are four scenes, but the prominent points are different. The scene in the stage play where Lin Xiangqian and Shi Yang expose Wei Xueqing's conspiracy is simplified in the film to the flatcar incident. The author's purpose is to delete the gang contradictions among the workers. The contradictions between gangs are a historical fact, but since the Chinese Communist Party led the workers' movement, it has taken a back seat to the contradictions between the enemy and us. Emphasizing this contradiction again would weaken the contradiction between the enemy and us. This deletion is very correct. In the first scene of the third act of the stage play, Lin Xiangqian's arrest is due to the betrayal of the traitor Liang Chengwu. The film deletes this character. This deletion is also correct. Around 1923, the enemy was not yet experienced enough in class struggle. Sending Liang Chengwu to the trade union to sabotage, as in the stage play, was the practice of the later Kuomintang. Bai Jianwu is insidious and vicious, but at that time, he could only attempt to lure a worker with two hundred and forty Hong Kong dollars, as written in the current film. The deletion of the Liang Chengwu storyline in the film gives the opportunity and space to make way for the positive depiction of the Great Strike. The broad scenes of the Great Strike, the demonstration parade, and the description of the February 7th bloody struggle are the greatest successes of the film. The long whistle of the locomotive as a signal for the Great Strike, the surging crowds after the strike began, the roar of the demonstrators rushing into the Hankou concession, Sun Yuliang's heroic fight with the enemy with his flesh and blood, Shi Yang's fearless spirit of going to his death when surrounded, Lin Xiangqian's loyal and unyielding heroism before his sacrifice, etc., created a magnificent and surging revolutionary momentum that shook the mountains and overturned the seas, and more broadly summarized the history of the heroic and unparalleled revolutionary struggle of the working class under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party during this period, thereby further highlighting the theme expressed in the film. The reason why the film adaptation achieved these successes is that, on the one hand, it accepted the experience gained in the stage play and took a step forward ideologically. On the other hand, it is because the screenwriter and director understood the different properties of the two artistic weapons of film and stage play. He did not simply copy what was successful on the stage but was good at re-creating it according to the characteristics of film art.

Those who have seen the stage play will not forget: Shi Yang's long speech at the station and the exciting lines at the end introducing the Soviet Union to the workers; Shi Yang's verbal jousting with Bai Jianwu in front of the Pule Theater and his impassioned speech to the police and soldiers; after Lin Xiangqian was arrested, Shi Yang's words to stabilize the workers' emotions and encourage everyone to rely on the Chinese Communist Party to continue the struggle. … These were all good scenes that once made our blood boil and our spirits high in the audience. But in the film, these scenes are either gone, or if they are there, they are not as inspiring. Why is that? I think the screenwriter and director intentionally omitted these in the film, or intentionally weakened them. Naturally, part of the reason is that the author intentionally reduced Shi Yang's position in the film. But another reason is that the screenwriter and director knew that these good scenes could not be copied to the film. Such long, inflammatory speeches cannot achieve the same effect on film as on stage. Because of this, the author took a different approach, seeking other ways to express the revolutionary enthusiasm contained in Shi Yang's long lines. The greatest success of the film that I mentioned above is precisely what the author used to replace the good scenes on the stage. This is precisely where the artistic creation of the adapter lies. He transformed the lines that appealed to the audience's hearing into film images that appealed to the audience's vision.

The success of the film adaptation is not limited to this. Because the screenwriter and director grasped the characteristics of film art, breaking through the strict limitations of time and space in the stage play, they expanded the description of life more widely and deeply. The workers' lives developed from Lin Xiangqian's small family to various workshops, to trade unions, night schools, and the entire workers' residential area; a Fujian Street introduced to the audience a typical scene illustrating the extreme poverty of workers' lives at that time. Lin Xiangqian's family life, the two appearances of Shi Yang's wife, and Bai Jianwu's private life were lightly sketched, making a strong contrast between the lives of the rulers and the people. Chen Guizhen's participation in the struggle in the streets and her work with the workers' families, a shot of a rickshaw puller, and the support of students and citizens for the strike made the struggle of the Great Strike even more magnificent. The appearance of the leading figure of the Party, Lao He (Xiang Delong mentioned in the play), and the rewriting of the character Sun Yuliang made the organization and determination of this strike even stronger. In particular, Sun Yuliang's heroic sacrifice thoroughly expressed the fearless spirit of the workers at that time. Wu Peifu is only lightly sketched in the film, but it deeply reveals the cruelty of the warlord rule; the police chief Huang Dianchen, on the contrary, illustrates the ignorance and stupidity of this rule; from Hu Datou, Wei Xueqing, Huang Dianchen to Zhao Jixian, Bai Jianwu, and even Wu Peifu, the reactionary heads at all levels of the warlord rule are all portrayed in their respective roles. … These scenes and characters added in the film are all meaningful. And when they are combined, they make the social situation at that time gain a more comprehensive reflection. Therefore, the film is richer in historical features than the stage play. This is also an important aspect of the success of the film adaptation.

However, the adaptation of the film "The Storm" is not without its shortcomings. It has many new creations in the adaptation, and has achieved many new successes, but new shortcomings have also arisen. It can also be said that new shortcomings have arisen from the advantages of the film expression method. We all know that film has more freedom in expression methods than stage plays. The strict space constraints can be freely broken through, the distance of time can also be freely shortened, and the characters are no longer required to be as strictly concentrated as in stage plays, etc. But this freedom cannot be abused, and they must still be subject to the concentration of conflict. Otherwise, this "freedom" will form dispersion. For example, the new characters added in the film are all that should be added, and they are also meaningful, but except for the creation of Wu Peifu and the added part of Sun Yuliang, the additions of people like Lao He and Huang Dianchen did not add too much new to the film. Lao He, as a representative of the Party's leading figures, should appear in the film so that the Party's leading role in the Great Strike can be better written. However, the author failed to create this character with sufficient ink, and in many places, he only shared the tasks of Shi Yang and Lin Xiangqian, which relatively weakened the descriptions of Shi Yang and Lin Xiangqian; similarly, because Wei Xueqing is the police chief on the Beijing-Hankou Road and cannot perform police duties in Zhengzhou City, one has to write a Huang Dianchen, but Huang Dianchen in the film cannot but be the incarnation of Wei Xueqing. Shi Yang's wife also failed to become an organic part of the story in the film, and the French factory director did not play the role it should have. This makes the originally more concentrated characters scattered, thus affecting the concentration of dramatic conflict. Similar to the situation of the dispersed characters, the shortcomings of dispersion also occurred in several important plots and important dramatic conflicts. For example, Wei Xueqing wanted to kill Huang Defa by borrowing the flatcar incident, which was originally combined with his and Zhao Jixian's attempt to create gang disputes among the workers. There is no need to emphasize the gang problem, and it is right to remove it. But the removed things were not replaced by appropriate plots. Originally, Lin Xiangqian took this opportunity to expose the enemy's conspiracy, and Shi Yang also took the opportunity to publicize the importance of unity to the workers, and further introduced the emergence of the emerging country, the Soviet Union, which was done in one go, unfolding many contradictions and many plots in one scene, and achieving a highly concentrated stage effect. This concentrated effect was formed by using the gang dispute as a consistent thread. Now that it has been removed, although several good plots and scenes are still there, they are like broken pearls, all scattered. The character of Wei Xueqing is therefore simplified; Lin Xiangqian's appearance at the station is therefore weak and powerless; the propaganda carried out by Shi Yang to the workers was originally a long line, which was not suitable for film expression, but the author failed to give up here, and did not find a more suitable film expression method, so he lazily copied it, and changed the occasion of the propaganda to the night school, and also shared this task with Lin Xiangqian, which made the original inspiring words said in the course of the struggle become a straightforward night school textbook, and naturally lost the inherent magic power to move people. Even the moving plot of Chen Guizhen lending money to Jiang Youcai's wife before regardless of gang relations was lost and had to be deleted. Originally, it was an exceptionally concentrated and dramatic scene, but because no suitable central plot was found to replace it and reorganize it, it became a plate of scattered beads, which cannot be said to be a failure. A similar example is the scene in front of the Pule Theater. Originally, this scene was concentrated by a variety of conflicting contradictions: here are the contradictions between the different characters of Bai Jianwu, Zhao Jixian, and Wei Xueqing, the contradictions between soldiers and police, and the contradictions between Hu Datou and soldiers. Above these complex contradictions, Shi Yang and Bai Jianwu unfolded a conflict of verbal jousting, followed by Shi Yang's inflammatory speech to the soldiers, disintegrating the enemy's armed forces, thereby announcing the establishment of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Trade Union, and the struggle achieved victory. The success of this scene lies in the concentration of contradictions. The film seems to be largely based on the original stage play, but in fact, there have been great changes. Wei Xueqing and Hu Datou were replaced by Huang Dianchen, the contradictions between soldiers and police were deleted, Bai Jianwu and Zhao Jixian did not appear, and the conflict between Shi Yang and Bai Jianwu was also omitted. What remains is the single conflict between workers and the warlord's pawns—the police. The advantage of this change is that it makes the conflict concise and powerful, emphasizing the revolutionary momentum of the workers, thus achieving a new success that the stage play cannot have, which should be affirmed. But the disadvantage is that the dramatic conflict is dispersed. The deep and complex conflict originally formed on various contradictions has become simplified. More regrettably, the characters of the main characters on both sides were fully developed here, but now they also seem flat. This scene is not as radiant as before. This is very regrettable. But the shortcomings of the adaptation of "The Storm" are only partial, and these shortcomings cannot cover up its brilliant achievements in the artistic creation of the adaptation. I repeat: "The Storm" is a good film, and it and the stage play "Red Storm" each have their own merits.

    谈电影“风暴”的改编
    陈白尘
    话剧“红色风暴”是一出好戏，根据它改编的“风暴”也是一部好电影。二者真是各有千秋。从成功的小说、戏剧改编电影，并不能保证为好电影。有时甚至会相反。把一件艺术作品改编为另一形式的艺术，不是简单的故事移植，而是又一次严肃的艺术创造工作。根据小说“祝福”“林家铺子”等改编的同名电影，为改编工作做出光辉的范例，是值得赞颂的工作。而“风暴”则为从舞台剧改编方面提供了一次成功的经验。
    改编工作确实有其特有的困难。它必须忠实于原著，但又必须有所创造。有先看过舞台剧的说“风暴”不如“红色风暴”；先看了电影的人又说“红色风暴”不及电影。这都不公平，也都是不确切的。我说“红色风暴”和“风暴”都好，并非说它们都完美无缺。各有千秋，也就是各有得失。但它们的成败得失，应该从话剧和电影不同艺术形式的各自特点出发，对它们在思想性和艺术性上所获得的成就分别加以衡量。不能机械地以这种形式所获得的成就去衡量另一形式的作品。举例说，“红色风暴”里施洋有几次激动人心的演说，这都是好戏，但不能因为电影“风暴”里没有这几场戏，就简单地说电影不如舞台剧。
    但“风暴”既然是根据舞台剧所改编，而且出自同一编导者之手，那末将舞台剧与电影之间的异同作一比较，将二者各自的得失对照一下，却是一件饶有趣味的事，也是一件有益的事。可是这样的好题目有待专家们来执笔，我只能就有关改编的工作谈几点感想。
    这两部作品写的都是二七大罢工斗争史实，它们的主要人物相同，主要情节也大致相同，作者所企图表现的主题也完全相同。二七大罢工——京汉铁路大罢工，是中国共产党成立以后所领导的、中国工人阶级所进行的第一次流血的政治斗争，是1922年1月开始的“中国第一次罢工高潮的最后一个怒涛”。这次罢工不是反对某一个资本家的经济斗争，而是一次反对残酷地统治着中国人民的帝国主义及其走狗封建军阀的政治斗争。这次斗争的主要意义是：一方面显示了中国工人阶级坚强、英勇和自我牺牲的高贵品质，通过共产党员林祥谦、施洋等同志忠贞不屈、为工人阶级献出自己宝贵生命这一事实，更向全国人民证明了：只有中国共产党才是中国革命的领导者，才是中国人民的救星。另一方面，也充分暴露了帝国主义和军阀吴佩孚的狰狞面目，以及他们狼狈为奸相互勾结的内幕。这就为中国人民指出一条光明大道：要生存，要革命，只有在中国共产党的领导之下推翻帝国主义和封建军阀的联合统治。舞台剧“红色风暴”和电影“风暴”的作者是理解这一意义的。这是这两部作品获得成功的基本原因，也是二者最主要的相同之处。
    但编导者在这主题相同，人物、情节大致相同的两部作品中的艺术处理是不相同的。舞台剧分三幕七场，但主要的戏集中在四场戏里，就是第一幕第二场，林祥谦和施洋揭穿魏学清利用帮口制造工人之间矛盾的阴谋；第二幕第二场，普乐戏院门前施洋、林祥谦和白坚武等展开的最激烈的斗争；第三幕第一场，2月7日夜间林祥谦遭暗算被捕；及同幕第二场林祥谦慷慨就义。这四段大块文章，是舞台剧的四根擎天柱子。在电影里，分为六大段落（文学剧本分七段，但影片中删去了第六段）。主要的戏也集中在四段戏里：一是压道车事件的斗争；二是普乐戏院开成立会的斗争；三是大罢工；四是从大游行到二七大流血，到林祥谦、施洋被捕就义。都是四段戏，但突出的重点不同了。舞台剧林祥谦和施洋揭穿魏学清的阴谋一场戏，在电影里简化为压道车事件，作者的目的是删除了工人中间帮会矛盾。帮会之间的矛盾是历史事实，但自从中国共产党领导了工人运动，它在敌我矛盾面前退居次要地位了，再强调这种矛盾，反而会减弱敌我之间的矛盾。这一点删得很对。舞台剧第三幕第一场写林祥谦被捕是由于梁成武这个内奸的暗算，电影删除了这一个人物。这一删除也是对的。当1923年左右，敌人在阶级斗争中也还不够老练，像舞台剧中那样派遣梁成武到工会内部来阴谋破坏，是后来国民党的做法。白坚武是阴险毒辣的，但他当时只能像现在电影里所写的那样，企图以二百四十块港洋来诱惑一个工人。而电影里删除了梁成武这一线索，就给予机会也腾出篇幅让位给大罢工的正面描写了。而大罢工的广阔场面和示威大游行以及2月7日流血斗争的描写，正是电影的最大成功之处。作为大罢工信号的汽笛长啸，罢工开始后汹涌的人潮，冲进汉口租界示威群众的怒吼，孙玉亮以血肉之躯和敌人进行的英勇格斗，施洋被围时慷慨赴义的无畏精神，林祥谦牺牲前忠贞不屈的英雄气概，等等，在电影中造成了一股震撼山岳、翻江倒海的磅礴汹涌的革命气势，更深广地概括了这一时期在中国共产党领导下的工人阶级英勇无比的革命斗争历史，从而更加突出了电影所表现的主题。电影改编本所以获得这些成功，一方面是由于接受了舞台剧所取得的经验在思想上又提高一步。另一方面则由于编导者理解电影和舞台剧这两种艺术武器的不同性能，他不是把舞台上成功的东西照搬过来，而是善于根据电影艺术特点重新加以创造。
    看过舞台剧的都不会忘记：施洋在车站上的长篇演说以及那一场最后向工人介绍苏联的激动人心的台词；施洋在普乐戏院门前和白坚武唇枪舌剑以及对警察士兵的慷慨陈词；林祥谦被捕以后，施洋为了稳定工人情绪，鼓动大家依靠中国共产党继续斗争的一段话。……这都是曾使我们在台下热血沸腾、精神昂扬的几场好戏。但在电影里，这几场戏或者没有了，或者有也没那样激动人心了。这是为什么呢？我看编导者在电影里正是有意地略去这些，或者是有意地减弱它的。自然，这其中的部分原因是作者有意把施洋在电影里的地位减轻了。但另一原因则是编导者深知这些好戏无法照搬到电影里来。这样长段的煽动性的演说，在电影中是不可能取得舞台上同样的效果的。正由于此，作者才另辟蹊径，把施洋长篇台词中所含有的革命热情寻找别的方式来表现。我上面所说的电影中最大的成功之处，正是作者用以代替舞台上几场好戏的。这也正是改编者的艺术创造所在。他把诉之于观众听觉的台词转化为诉之于观众视觉的电影画面了。
    电影改编本的成功之处还不仅止于此。由于编导者抓住了电影艺术的特点，突破舞台剧中时间和空间的严格限制，更广泛也更深入地扩大了生活面的描写。工人生活由林祥谦狭小家庭里开展到各个车间里，到工会里、夜校里，到整个工人住宅区里；一条福建街就给观众介绍了一个说明当时工人生活极端穷困的典型的场景。林祥谦的家庭生活，施洋夫人的两度出现，和白坚武私生活那轻轻一笔，就把统治者和人民之间的生活作了强烈的对照。陈桂贞在街头参加斗争以及对工人家属的工作，人力车夫的一个镜头，学生、市民对罢工的支持，使得大罢工的斗争更显得壮阔。党的领导人物老何（话剧中提到的项德龙）的出现，孙玉亮这个人物的改写，使得这次罢工的组织性和坚决性更显得加强，特别是孙玉亮的壮烈牺牲，虎虎有生气，把当时工人英勇无畏的精神透彻地表现了出来。吴佩孚这个人物在电影中仅淡淡几笔，却更深刻地透出军阀统治的残暴；警察局长黄殿辰则相反地说明这个统治的无知与愚蠢；从胡大头、魏学清、黄殿辰到赵继贤、白坚武，以至吴佩孚，军阀统治中各级反动头子，都各如其份地被刻划出来。……电影中所增添的这些场景和人物，都是有意义的。而它们被综合在一起，遂使得当时的社会面貌获得较全面的反映。所以电影较之舞台剧就更富有时代特征。这也是电影改编本获得成功的重要的一面。
    但电影“风暴”的改编也不是毫无缺点的。它在改编中有很多新的创造，取得不少新的成功，但随之也产生了新的缺点。也可以说是从电影表现方法的优点中产生的新缺点。我们都知道电影较之舞台剧在表现方法上有更多的自由，严格的空间限制可以自由突破，时间的距离也可以自由缩短，人物也不再像舞台剧那样要求严格的集中，等等。但这种自由不能滥用，它们还得服从于矛盾冲突的集中。否则，这种“自由”就会形成分散。比如说，电影中新增加的人物都是应该增加的，也是有意义的，但除了吴佩孚的创造和孙玉亮的增添部分以外，像老何、黄殿辰等人的增添，并没给电影增加太多新的东西。老何作为一个代表党的领导人物，是应该在电影中出现的，这才能更好地写出党在大罢工中的领导作用。但作者未能以足够的笔墨创造这一人物，很多地方只不过让他分担了施洋和林祥谦的任务而已，这就相对地减弱了施洋和林祥谦的描写；同样情况，由于魏学清是京汉路上的警务处长，不能在郑州市上执行警务，便不能不写一个黄殿辰，但电影中的黄殿辰就不能不是魏学清的化身了。施洋夫人也没能在电影中成为故事的有机组成部分，法国籍厂长也没起应有的作用。这就使得本来较集中的人物反而分散了，因而也就影响了戏剧冲突的集中。与人物分散情况相类似，在某几处重要情节和重要的戏剧冲突中，也产生了分散的缺点。比如魏学清借压道车事件要杀黄得发，原来是和他以及赵继贤企图在工人中间制造帮口纠纷结合在一起的。帮口问题没有被强调的必要，抽掉是对的。但抽掉的东西没有被适当的情节所代替。原来林祥谦乘此机会揭穿敌人阴谋，施洋也就利用时机向工人宣传团结的重要，并进一步介绍了新兴的国家苏联的出现，一气呵成，把许多矛盾、许多情节都放在一场戏里展开，获得了高度集中的舞台效果。这一集中的效果是由于把帮口纠纷作为一根贯串的线而形成的。现在抽掉了它，若干好的情节、场景虽然都还在，却好比断线的珍珠，都分散了。魏学清这个人物因此简单化了；林祥谦在车站的出现也因此而软弱无力了；施洋对工人所进行的宣传，原是长篇台词，本不适宜于电影表现的，但作者在此未能割爱，又未找到更适宜于电影的表现方法，便偷懒地照搬了过来，而且把宣传的场合改到夜校里去了，还和林祥谦共同分担了这项任务，这就更使得原本是在斗争进行中说的一番富有煽动鼓舞力量的话，成了平铺直叙的夜校教材，自然就失去那种固有的动人心弦的魔力了。甚至连陈桂贞前此不计帮口关系借钱给江有才妻子那一动人的情节，也失去依据而只好删去了。原来是一场异常集中、充满戏剧冲突的好戏，由于没找到适当的中心情节来代替，使之重行组织起来，集中起来，反而成为一盘散珠，这不能说不是败笔。类似的例子，还有普乐戏院门前的一场戏，原来这场戏是由多种矛盾冲突集中起来的：这里有白坚武、赵继贤、魏学清之间不同性格的矛盾，有士兵与警察之间的矛盾，有胡大头和士兵之间的矛盾，而在这些错综复杂的矛盾之上，展开了施洋与白坚武之间的一场唇枪舌剑的冲突，继之以施洋对士兵们的煽动性的演说，瓦解了敌人武装，从而宣告京汉铁路总工会成立，斗争取得了胜利。这场戏的成功在于矛盾的集中。电影在表面看是大体依照舞台剧原样的，但实际上有很大的改变。魏学清和胡大头被黄殿辰所代替，士兵、警察之间的矛盾被删去了，白坚武、赵继贤都未出场，施洋与白坚武的一场冲突因此也被省略了，剩下的就是工人与军阀爪牙——警察之间的单一冲突了。这样改的优点在于使冲突简洁有力，强调了工人群众的革命气势，因而获得了舞台剧所不能有的新的成功，这是应该肯定的。但缺点在于戏剧冲突被分散了，原来在诸种矛盾上所形成的深厚而复杂的冲突变得简单化了，更遗憾的是，原来在冲突中双方主要人物的性格在此都得到充分的发展，现在也显得平板了。这场戏不及原先那样光芒四射了。这是很可惜的。但“风暴”改编本的缺点只是局部的，这些缺点无法掩盖它在改编这种艺术创造中所取得的辉煌成绩。我再重复说一遍：“风暴”是部好电影，它和舞台剧“红色风暴”是各有千秋的。
