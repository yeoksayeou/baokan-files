(Our report from Lanzhou, November 22) Dongliang Mountain Village in Wu Shan County, Gansu Province, famous throughout the country for diverting water up the mountain, continued to construct water conservancy projects under the leadership of the local Party committee after the people of the county diverted the Nie River water to the 1,900-meter-high Dongliang Mountain in 1956 with their heroic spirit of daring to think and act. Now, the entire irrigation area has formed a mountain self-flowing irrigation network combining diversion, storage, and usage. Relying on the collective wisdom of the masses, taking soil as the main factor, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and adapting to local conditions, they created various mountain irrigation methods, enabling all 36,000 mu of land in the entire irrigation area to completely escape the threat of drought and realize the desire of "water source guaranteed in all four seasons, no disaster even with a hundred days of severe drought." The per-mu yield of grain has leaped from 80 jin before the water went up the mountain to more than 200 jin this year. Many low-yield grain crops and newly introduced economic crops have created large-scale high-yield records.

    After Dongliang Mountain was incorporated into the Luomen People's Commune, a separate management district was established. Now, the mountain tops, slopes, and terraced fields of the entire irrigation area have realized a water conservancy irrigation network combining diversion, storage, and usage. This is due to the full utilization of the superiority of the commune being "large" and "public," overall arrangement, comprehensive planning, and the implementation of the four major constructions of advanced water conservancy in accordance with local conditions.

    First, they used porcelain and tile pipes to change open channels into underground pipelines, taking measures such as preserving ponds with channel water, irrigating land with pond water, intercepting and storing water at every section, and setting up defenses everywhere, forming an underground channel-pond-pipeline irrigation network, which connected the land into contiguous pieces, provided conditions for mechanized farming, and guaranteed year-round irrigation.

    Second, they built inverted siphons to sequentially divert water to various mountain tops, turning the land on the mountain tops into paddy fields.

    Third, water pools were installed on high field ridges, and artificial rainfall spray irrigation was implemented on mountain slope terraced fields using natural water pressure. On the basis of the short-range artificial rain-making device last year, the people of Dongliang Mountain created a medium-range friction wheel sprinkler this year, each capable of spraying 1.1 mu of land, making the water consumption per mu 12 cubic meters less than self-flowing irrigation, preventing the soil from crusting and being eroded, and increasing grain yield by 10%-20% compared with self-flowing irrigation. The increase in vegetable crop production is even more significant. Last year, the average per-mu yield of pumpkins in Hejiawan was 6,400 jin. This year, after using artificial sprinkler irrigation, it jumped to 9,063 jin.

    Fourth, tap water was installed using the pressure of channel water flowing downward. In Baijia Village, the highest point on Dongliang Mountain, commune members not only use tap water for cooking and feeding livestock, but also use bathrooms and toilets with tap water in their newly built houses.

    With the development of advanced mountain water conservancy construction, conditions have been created for the gradual realization of electrification and mechanization in mountainous areas. Since the birth of the first Dongliang hydropower station in July 1958, the second Dongliang power station was built in February this year, enabling every household on the mountain to install electric lights and every village to install loudspeakers. Electricity is also widely used in industry and transportation. Three flax processing plants have been established in Baijia Village and Hejiawan, and electric flax pressing machines and cotton ginning machines have been installed, which can produce 50,000 jin of flax annually; and a 30-horsepower flour mill has been built, which can process 720,000 jin of grain annually, basically solving the problem of the masses going down the mountain to grind flour. In order to save a lot of labor, a cable car was boldly built from the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain, solving transportation difficulties.

    Diverting water up the mountain has played an important role in expanding land utilization, greatly promoting the benefits of mountains, water, grasses, and trees, and vigorously developing diversified economies. Important industrial raw materials and export goods that could not be produced in the past are now being produced in large quantities. In addition to large-scale planting of economic crops such as hemp, flax, rapeseed, sugar beet, and vegetables, they have also cultivated large grasslands, built 11 sheep farms, raised 1,200 sheep, produced more than 3,000 jin of wool annually; raised more than 100 boxes of bees, produced more than 4,000 jin of honey annually; and used channels and ponds to raise fish and ducks. In recent years, professional teams have been established here to develop barren mountain slopes and cultivate more than 3 million economic tree species such as apples, pears, mulberries, peaches, apricots, grapes, walnuts, peppers, and lacquer trees, which not only afforest the mountainous areas, but also increase the income of commune members. This year, the apple trees in Baijia Village and Panpo have borne their first fruitful fruits. In the future, various economic trees on Dongliang Mountain will gradually realize their benefits year by year.

    Encouraged by the spirit of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the people of Dongliang Mountain are currently carrying out a massive garden-style movement to transform mountain land and improve soil with soaring enthusiasm. At the same time, a 42-meter-high reservoir is being built at the water intake of the Dongliang Canal. After the completion of the project, it can generate a large amount of electricity, raise fish and ducks, and obtain more wealth.

    东梁山贯彻以土为主土洋结合因地制宜方针
    建成引蓄用三结合水利网
    综合利用水力促使农林牧副渔一齐发展
    本报兰州22日电　全国著名的引水上山旗帜——甘肃武山县东梁山村在1956年该县人民以敢想敢干的英雄气概，将聂河水引上海拔一千九百米的东梁山以后，在当地党委的领导下，续继兴修水利。现在，整个灌区已经形成引、蓄、用三结合的山地自流灌溉网。依靠群众的集体智慧，以土为主，土洋结合，因地制宜地创造了各种各样的山地灌溉方法，使全灌区的三万六千亩土地，完全摆脱了干旱威胁，实现了“水源四季有保证，大旱百日不成灾”的愿望。粮食单产由水上山前的八十斤跃进到今年的两百多斤，许多低产粮食作物和新上山的经济作物，都创造了大面积的高产纪录。
    东梁山并入洛门人民公社之后，单独成立了一个管理区。现在，整个灌区的山顶、坡地、梯田都实现了引、蓄、用三结合的水利灌溉网，这是由于充分发挥了公社“大”和“公”的优越性，统筹安排，全面规划，因地制宜地进行了高级水利化四大建设的缘故。
    首先，他们利用瓷管瓦管把明渠改为地下管道，采取渠水保塘、塘水灌地，节节拦蓄、处处设防的措施，组成地下渠塘管道灌溉网，使土地连片，为机耕提供条件，并保证常年灌溉。
    其次是建筑导虹吸管，依次把水引上各个山头，使山头上的土地变成水田。
    第三，在高地埂上装置水池，利用水的自然压力，在山坡梯田实行人工降雨的喷雾灌溉。东梁山人民在去年近射程人工降雨器的基础上，今年又创造了中射程摸擦轮喷头，每个可喷射一点一亩土地，使每亩用水量比自流灌溉省水十二方，做到地不板结、不冲刷，粮食产量较自流灌溉的地提高10％—20％。尤其是蔬菜作物增产更为显著，去年何家湾的南瓜平均亩产为六千四百斤，今年采用人工喷灌后，便跃增到九千零六十三斤。
    第四，利用渠水向下倾泄的压力装设了自来水。东梁山上最高点的柏家村，社员不但用自来水做饭、喂牲口，而且在新建的住宅里使用着有自来水的浴室、厕所。
    随着山地高级水利化建设的发展，给逐步实现山区电气化、机械化创造了条件。自1958年7月东梁第一水力发电站诞生后，今年2月又建起东梁第二电站，使全山人民家家户户安上了电灯，村村装置了扩音喇叭。电气还广泛利用在工业和交通运输方面。在柏家村、何家湾建立了三座亚麻加工厂，安装了电动压麻机、弹花机，每年可制亚麻五万斤；并修起三十马力的面粉厂一处，每年可加工粮食七十二万斤，基本解决了群众下山磨面的问题。为了节约大量劳动力，还大胆地从山脚下修了一条通向山顶的电缆飞车，解决了运输上的困难。
    引水上山，对于扩大土地利用，大兴山水草木之利，大力发展多种经济都起到了重要的作用。过去不能出产的重要工业原料和出口物资，现在开始大量生产了。他们除大面积的种植大麻、胡麻、油菜、甜菜、蔬菜等经济作物外，还培育了大片草原，兴建了十一座羊场，养羊一千二百只，年产羊毛三千多斤；养蜂一百多箱，年产蜂蜜四千余斤；并且利用渠塘饲养了鱼和鸭。几年来，这里建立了专业队，开发了山坡荒地，栽培苹果、梨、蚕桑、桃杏、葡萄、核桃、花椒、漆树等各类经济树种三百多万株，既绿化了山区，又增加了社员收入。今年柏家村和潘坡的苹果树已第一次结下丰硕的果子，今后东梁山上各类经济树将会逐年发挥效益。
    东梁山人民在党的八届八中全会决议的精神鼓舞下，目前正以冲天干劲，开展一个声势浩大的改造山地、改良土壤的园田化运动。同时在东梁渠渠首的引水口兴建一座四十二米高的水库，工程竣工后，即可大量的发电、养鱼、养鸭，获得更多的财富。
