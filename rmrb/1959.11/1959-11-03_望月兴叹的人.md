    The Moon-Gazing Sighers
    Poem by Yuan Shuipai, Painting by Hua Junwu
    Reports say: Some Americans are "staring blankly, at a loss for what to do."
    "How hateful, how hateful! They arbitrarily named the far side of the moon, calling it whatever they please, and we have no share in it at all!"
    "How sad, how sad! The sea is called Moscow, the mountain is called Soviet, why not call it the Pentagon, or Taft-Hartley?"
    "To my liking, this mountain should be called Truman, or Vampire, Nixon, or Rattlesnake, Honest John, etc."
    "To suit my wishes, this sea should be called McCarthy. To commemorate my beloved, it might as well be called Hee—."
    The crescent moon shines over the five continents, every family rejoices, one family grieves, Long live socialism! The masses cheer and soar into the universe.
    Every family praises the greatness of the Soviet Union! Only your family is staring foolishly at the photo!
    Cry! Tremble! Pull your hair and go to heaven!

    望月兴叹的人
    袁水拍诗　华君武画
    报载：美国有些人“正在无计可施地呆望着”。“可恨呀可恨！他们把月球背面随意命名，爱叫什么就叫什么，竟然全没有我们的份！“可悲呀可悲！海叫莫斯科，山叫苏维埃，为什么不叫五角大楼，或者塔夫脱—哈特莱？“要称我的心，这山该叫杜鲁门，或者吸血鬼，尼克松，或者响尾蛇，诚实的约翰等。“要中我的意，这海该叫麦卡锡。为了纪念我的亲爱的，还不妨叫做希——。”月儿弯弯照五洲，家家欢乐一家愁，社会主义万岁！万众欢呼腾宇宙。家家都夸苏联伟大！只有你一家面对照片发了傻！哭泣吧！发抖吧！拉着头发上天吧！
