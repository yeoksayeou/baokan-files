　　Big Livestock and Small Poultry Thrive Together
　　Xiangyang Commune's Cattle Increase by 30% in One Year
　　Guandao Commune's "Qinchuan Cattle" All Successfully Bred
　　(Reported by this newspaper) The Xiangyang People's Commune in Tian'e County, Guangxi, saw a tremendous leap forward in animal husbandry in the first year after communization. The number of cattle increased by 33%, from an average of two cattle per household to three.
　　The Xiangyang Commune has more than 1,400 Zhuang and Han households. Before liberation, there were 1,250 cattle. During the period of advanced cooperatives, this number increased to 2,920, an increase of 1,670. In the first year after the establishment of the commune, it jumped to 4,352, an increase of another 1,432. Before communization, it took nine years to increase from an average of nearly one head of cattle per household to two. After communization, it took only one year to increase by another head, reaching three. The rapid development of animal husbandry has increased the commune's wealth and promoted agricultural production. Each main laborer in the commune can now use more than two cattle, with some using as many as four or five, creating favorable conditions for expanding planting areas. This spring, Quanping Brigade opened up 460 mu of wasteland. If they had used human labor and hoes as in the past, it would have taken more than 1,500 workdays. This year, with the widespread use of cattle power, it only took 230 workdays. As a result, the area planted with food crops in the commune has expanded by 70% compared to before communization, from 14,500 mu to more than 24,000 mu. The application of cow dung to farmland has also increased significantly. According to a survey by the third production team of Xiangyang Brigade, this year each mu of early rice used 55 dan of cow dung (excluding other chemical fertilizers and miscellaneous fertilizers), more than double last year's amount. Due to the increase in refined fertilizer and the comprehensive implementation of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, the commune's summer grain harvest increased by 50% compared to the same period last year. The total annual output is estimated to increase by 73.9% compared to last year. During the spring plowing season, the Xiangyang Commune also sold more than 1,100 cattle, strongly supporting the production of fraternal communes both inside and outside the county.
　　The Xiangyang Commune is located in the mountainous area on the northwest border of Guangxi, along the Hong River, with vast land and plenty of reclaimable wasteland. Moreover, with lush water and grass, it is a good place to develop animal husbandry. Here, it is extremely advantageous to implement a combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, promoting each other. However, before the establishment of the commune, due to the small scale of the advanced cooperative organizations, after animal husbandry developed to a certain extent, it was difficult to achieve larger-scale and faster development. The slow development of cattle also limited the deep plowing and meticulous cultivation of agriculture, as well as the expansion of the planting area. After the establishment of the commune, conditions for great development were in place. The commune's Party committee considered that raising more cattle would save labor, increase fertilizer, and expand cultivated land area, so they made cattle raising a key undertaking.
　　While focusing on grain production, the CCP Xiangyang Commune Committee strengthened its leadership in developing animal husbandry, assigning a secretary and the commune's animal husbandry minister to be specifically responsible. It also allocated funds from the commune's public accumulation to establish a livestock farm, specifically responsible for breeding livestock, feeding management, and disease prevention experiments, using this as a base to guide the development of animal husbandry production throughout the commune. Each brigade established professional animal husbandry teams, formulated management and reward systems, and equipped them with stronger cadres to lead animal husbandry production.
　　Rational allocation of pastures is another important condition for developing animal husbandry. Based on the number of cattle in each brigade and the distribution of farmland, the commune made overall plans, dividing all suitable grazing areas into 368 pastures and allocating them to brigades and production teams for rotational grazing. The pasture disputes that could not be resolved for many years were reasonably settled. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members for grazing was greatly enhanced. The entire commune built more than 350 spacious cattle pens near the fields and water, facilitating both feeding and fertilizer production.
　　The entire commune also launched a "Make Every Cow Pregnant" campaign, establishing mating stations in every team, strengthening cattle mating and selection work. 95% of the cows were bred, changing the previous state of natural breeding. In addition, the commune organized folk veterinary teams, trained 85 veterinarians, promoted more than 70 effective prescriptions, and organized mobile medical teams to work in the livestock farms and grazing teams of various brigades and production teams. As a result, fewer cattle died and more were born this year, with cattle increasing by 40% in less than a year.

　　(Reported by this newspaper) The Guandao People's Commune in Weinan, Shaanxi, the famous "Qinchuan Cattle" producing area, is making rapid progress in autumn livestock breeding. According to recent statistics, 2,438 heads have been bred, accounting for 99.3% of the number that should be bred, basically achieving full breeding and full pregnancy.
　　The good work in autumn livestock breeding in this commune is due to the implementation of the breeding tasks, promoting the "One Leader and Three Members" responsibility system, with the production team leader being responsible, the veterinarian guaranteeing the trough, the breeder guaranteeing the mating, and the feeder guaranteeing the pregnancy. In order to achieve balanced development and timely breeding, the commune's artificial comprehensive insemination breeding station and 35 breeding bulls were divided into three large areas and eight small areas according to region, with clear division of labor and contracts to the end. A register of estrus in cows was established to keep track of the date of estrus, conception, and calving in a timely manner. In order to ensure that breeding and draft work are not delayed, comrades at the breeding station carried semen to the production team or feeding room to inseminate cows in heat. Some even led breeding animals to the market for mating, while others pulled breeding animals to the trough for mating. The Guandi Management District adopted the above methods and bred 124 heads in two days, achieving full breeding.
　　In order to encourage the enthusiasm of breeders and feeders, the commune has also established a responsibility system and a reward system. The specific regulations are: if a feeder guarantees the mating and calving of a young animal, the feeder will be rewarded with work points equivalent to three labor days; for each young animal born and guaranteed to survive for one month, the feeder will be rewarded with work points equivalent to five labor days; under normal circumstances, if a cow has not been bred within three months, appropriate criticism and education should be given. Each breeding animal must guarantee the breeding of 120 heads within one year. If the specified standard is exceeded without harming the body of the breeding animal, remuneration will be given: 60% to the breeder and 30% to the production team.
　　In order to strengthen political leadership, the commune has also universally established a competition system for livestock breeding and reproduction, and comprehensively launched a "Five Checks and Five Comparisons" red flag competition, checking thoughts and comparing enthusiasm, checking tasks and comparing measures, checking empty pregnancies and comparing breeding, checking time and comparing progress, checking the number of breeding and comparing the number of conceptions, forming a movement in which red flags are planted everywhere and everyone strives to be advanced.

    大家畜小家禽齐兴旺
    向阳公社一年耕牛增加三成
    官道公社“秦川牛”全配满怀
    本报讯　广西天峨县向阳人民公社在公社化后第一年，畜牧业获得特大跃进，耕牛增长了33％，由平均每户两头牛增加到三头。
    向阳公社有一千四百多户僮、汉族社员，解放前有牛一千二百五十头。高级社时，发展到二千九百二十头，增加了一千六百七十头。公社成立一年，一跃增为四千三百五十二头，又增加了一千四百三十二头。公社化前，用九年时间从平均每户将近一头牛发展到两头，公社化后仅一年时间，平均每户又增加了一头，达到三头。畜牧业的飞快发展，为公社增加了一大笔财富，同时也促进了农业生产。这个公社一个主要劳动力普遍可使用两头以上耕牛，多的至四、五头，这就为扩大种植面积创造了有利条件。全平大队今春开四百六十亩荒地，如以过去那样人力加锄头的干法，需要一千五百多个劳动日。今年普遍使用牛力，只花了二百三十个劳动日。因此，这个公社粮食作物种植面积比公社化前扩大了70％，由一万四千五百亩增加到二万四千多亩。农田施用的牛粪也有显著增加。据向阳大队第三生产队调查，今年每亩早稻用牛粪五十五担（其他化肥、杂肥不计），比去年增加一倍多。由于精肥增加，同时全面贯彻农业八字宪法，全社夏收粮食比去年同期增长了50％。全年估计总产量可比去年增长73.9％。春耕时，向阳公社还卖出耕牛一千一百多头，有力地支援了县内外一些兄弟公社的生产。
    向阳公社在广西西北边境的山区，红河边上，土地旷阔，可开垦荒地很多。而且水草并茂，又是发展畜牧业的好地方。在这里实行农牧并举，互相促进，是具有极为有利的条件的。但是，公社成立之前，由于高级社组织规模较小，畜牧业发展到一定程度之后，难得有更大规模的更快速的发展。由于耕牛发展不快，农业的深耕细作、扩大面积等，也受到一定限制。公社成立后，具备了大发展的条件。公社党委考虑多养牛一来可以节约劳动力，二来可以增加肥料，三来可以扩大耕地面积，便把养牛当作一项重点事业抓起来。
    中共向阳公社党委在抓好粮食生产的同时，加强对发展畜牧业的领导，指定一个书记和公社畜牧部长具体负责。并从公社的公共积累中拨出一笔资金建立了畜牧场，专门负责繁殖牲畜、饲养管理和防治疫病等试验，并以此作为指导全公社发展畜牧业生产的基地。各大队都建立畜牧业专业队，订立了管理和奖励制度，并配备了较强的干部领导畜牧业生产。
    合理分配牧场，是发展畜牧业的另一个重要条件。公社根据各大队耕牛数目，田地分布情况，统筹规划，把所有宜牧地区划分为三百六十八个牧场，分配给各大队、生产队轮流放牧。许多年来不能解决的牧场纠纷问题，得到合理解决了。广大社员放牧的积极性大为提高。全公社在近田近水草的地方修建了三百五十多个宽大的牛栏，既便于饲养，又便于生产用肥。
    全公社还开展了母牛满怀运动，队队建立配种站，加强耕牛配种选种工作，有95％的母牛配上种，改变过去繁殖自流状态。此外，公社还组织民间兽医队伍，培训了八十五个兽医，推广了七十多种良方，并组织巡回医疗队到各大队、生产队的畜牧场、放牧队开展工作。因此，这一年来耕牛死的少生的多，不及一年耕牛增长了40％。
    本报讯　有名的“秦川牛”产地——陕西渭南官道人民公社，秋季大家畜配种工作进展迅速。最近统计，已配种二千四百三十八头，占应配种数的99.3％，基本上做到全配、满怀。
    这个公社大家畜秋季配种工作搞得好，是由于配种任务落实，推行生产队长负责、兽医员保槽、配种员保配、饲养员保胎的“一长三员”负责制。为了达到平衡发展，及时配种，把全社的一个人工综合授精配种站和三十五个种公畜，按地区划分为三大片、八小片，明确分工，包干到底，并建立了母畜发情登记簿，及时掌握母畜发情、受胎和产仔日期。为了做到配种和使役两不误，配种站的同志就背着精液送到生产队或饲养室给发情的母畜输精，有的还牵种畜上集进行配种，有的拉种畜到槽头配种。官底管区采取以上办法，在两天内就配种一百二十四头，达到了全配。
    为了鼓舞配种员和饲养员的积极性，公社还建立了责任制和奖励制。具体规定：凡是保配保产一头幼畜的，给饲养员奖励三个劳动日的工分；每产一头幼畜并保证生后一个月不死的，给饲养员奖励五个劳动日的工分；在正常情况下，三个月内没有给母畜配上种，应给予适当的批评教育。每头种畜在一年内必须保证配种一百二十头，超过规定标准而又不损害种畜身体的可得报酬：60％奖给配种员，30％归生产队。
    这个公社为了加强政治领导，还普遍建立了牲畜配种、繁殖的评比竞赛制度，全面开展了查思想比干劲、查任务比措施、查空怀比配种、查时间比进度、查配种数量比受胎多少的“五查五比”红旗竞赛，形成了一个处处插红旗、个个争先进的运动。
