This newspaper Chengdu, November 20th dispatch: Sichuan transportation departments, targeting the weak link of loading, unloading, and handling at port docks in short-distance transportation, launched a mass technical innovation campaign to achieve indigenous mechanization. Currently, 153 large and small ports and docks throughout the province have been transformed, which has both accelerated the turnover of vehicles and ships and saved a large amount of labor. Calculating only from the shortening of loading and unloading time for wooden boats and the increase in navigation efficiency, it is equivalent to increasing the wooden boat carrying capacity of the entire province by about 80,000 tons, and can transport 250,000 tons more materials per month.

Sichuan Province has many inland rivers, and the annual freight volume undertaken by inland rivers accounts for about half of the total freight volume of various means of transportation. Many important towns for collecting and distributing materials are located in the delta areas of river estuaries. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 300 ports and docks in the province, of which more than 100 have an annual throughput of 50,000 to 300,000 tons. However, because loading, unloading, and handling at these ports and docks mainly relied on manual carrying and shouldering in the past, too much labor was occupied. More than 100,000 workers throughout the province are engaged in port and dock loading, unloading, and handling. They not only have high labor intensity, but also low transportation efficiency, often causing congestion of vehicles and ships and backlog of materials, which seriously affects the transportation capacity of long-distance trunk lines of water and land transportation. From the perspective of the entire province, port and dock loading, unloading, and handling has become a "blind gut" in the current short-distance collection and distribution of materials and the entire transportation.

In order to solve this contradiction, Sichuan Province has launched a mass technical innovation movement with indigenous mechanization of loading, unloading, and handling centered on port docks, focusing on the "five transformations" of cable carization, vehicleization, craneization, chuteization, and conveyor beltization, requiring fast loading, fast transport, and fast unloading, so that urban ports and docks can achieve "six connections": connecting factories, connecting warehouses, connecting storage yards, connecting stations, connecting barges, and connecting basic construction sites. Luzhou City, a hub of water and land transportation in southern Sichuan, has many vehicles and ships and a large transportation volume, with a daily output of more than 7,000 tons of materials. The city originally had more than 3,000 porters, who still could not meet the needs of long-distance trunk line transportation despite carrying, shouldering, and lifting all day long. After the mass movement of indigenous mechanization was launched, the city built more than 80 various indigenous cable cars, tracks, shuttles, and chutes on the banks of the Yangtze River and Tuo River within only one month, with a total length of more than 13,700 meters; produced more than 300 various vehicles and more than 20 indigenous cranes. At the same time, it also created new tools such as animal-powered cable cars, trestle-style mobile docks, and roof-style and drawer-style unloading boxes, generally increasing work efficiency by two to ten times. Lantiaba Wharf uses a bull-drawn cable car instead of manual carrying to transport grain, and work efficiency has increased by three times; the manual gear shifting machine at the steamer wharf can pass 8 to 10 tons of coal per hour, which is four times faster than manual labor. Because the entire port has basically realized "one transformation and six connections," achieving fast handling and fast turnover of vehicles and ships, the phenomenon of material backlog has been completely eliminated. Originally, the city needed to add more than 3,000 loading and unloading workers, but now not only is it not increasing, but it has also transferred 1,000 people from the original workers to support other industrial departments.

In the mass movement of indigenous mechanization of port and dock loading, unloading, and handling, all localities have resolutely implemented the principles of focusing on indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, adapting to local conditions, and using local materials. The type and project of loading, unloading, and handling equipment are determined according to the terrain, material varieties, transportation volume, and other conditions. The masses are deeply mobilized to rely on their own efforts and overcome various difficulties. In the process of realizing the indigenous mechanization of loading, unloading, and handling at eight docks, the Daxian Mass Transportation Station, the masses put forward 85 major technical innovation suggestions.

The aerial circular transport vehicle jointly created by employees, is based on the size of the dock slope, inserting tree stumps of varying heights, installing horizontal wood on both sides, connecting the transport vehicle with the horizontal wood, putting on ropes, and using the weight of the goods to cycle up and down, each person can transport 24,000 catties of goods per day, and work efficiency is increased by five times. At the same time, it also has the advantages of being flexible, light, safe, and not restricted by natural conditions, and can be used day and night and in wind and rain.

At present, the indigenous mechanization movement of ports and docks throughout the province is developing in depth. More than 100 large and small ports and docks that have achieved indigenous mechanization have successively established technical innovation committees or innovation groups to continuously study and improve existing tools, making the inferior superior, the clumsy clever, the indigenous foreign, and the weak strong. At the same time, special attention is paid to the connection and coordination and comprehensive utilization of various tools, so that all operations in the entire loading, unloading, and handling process have machines, becoming a complete port and dock loading, unloading, and handling system.

This newspaper Chengdu, November 20th dispatch: Sichuan Province is actively taking measures to do everything possible to equip short-distance transport teams, and strive to achieve vehicle and boat mechanization in a short period of time.

Rapidly realizing the mechanization of transport vehicles and boats is an important measure taken by Sichuan Province on the current short-distance transportation front to enhance transport capacity and make the short-distance transportation movement continue to develop and consolidate and improve. Sichuan Province currently has a short-distance transport team of more than 1.1 million people. In October, it collected and transported a total of 7.16 million tons of materials, an increase of more than double from September. However, 60% of them do not have machinery, and the transportation efficiency has not been fully utilized. According to this situation, the Sichuan Provincial Transportation Leading Department believes that if the existing transport team is armed with 200,000 more pieces of vehicle and boat machinery, according to the lowest calculation, it is estimated that more than 400,000 labor forces can be saved, which is of great benefit to promoting the continued leap forward of industry and agriculture in the province.

In order to quickly equip the short-distance transport team, they adopted the method of repairing, extracting, and manufacturing. Repairing means quickly repairing damaged tools and strengthening maintenance and repair; extracting means extracting self-use transportation tools and sideline vehicles and ships of organs, schools, groups, residents, and communes in accordance with the principle of overall planning and comprehensive consideration to participate in transportation; manufacturing means manufacturing various vehicles and boats suitable for local use according to production needs. At present, more than a dozen special districts, cities (counties) in the province have basically achieved vehicle and boat mechanization.

After realizing vehicle and boat mechanization, not only is transportation strength saved, but also efficiency is greatly improved. In Nanchong Special District, there is an average of one vehicle or boat for every three people, and the phenomenon of manual carrying and shouldering in short-distance transportation has basically been eliminated. While repairing and manufacturing vehicles, the Hualingshan mining area in this district also actively built various roads, connecting the factories and mines in the mining area into one piece, so that factories are connected to highways, and furnaces are connected to frame cars and trolleys, thereby reducing the number of transport personnel in the mining area from more than 17,000 to more than 9,000, and the transport volume increased by more than 30% compared with the original. After the Yinyanggou Iron Plant in Bishan County realized vehicle transportation, it saved more than 1,100 transport labor forces and reduced various transportation costs by more than 1,400 yuan per month.

In the process of vigorously developing vehicle and boat mechanization, all localities have adhered to the mass line, using local materials, finding substitutes, and breaking through the material barrier. Some localities have conducted inventory checks on the inventory materials scattered in various organs, groups, and communes, and collected temporarily unused parts and stagnant materials to concentrate on building vehicles and boats. The Leshan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a special meeting on building vehicles and boats by people's communes along highways and rivers, mobilizing the masses to offer suggestions; 42 communes on both sides of the Minjiang River pledged to build more than 10,000 tons of wooden boats by the end of the year. Guang'an County in Nanchong Special District lacked iron nails for shipbuilding, and the shipbuilders automatically organized a diving team to salvage ships that had sunk to the bottom of the river over the years, recovering more than 70 tons of iron parts, which met the needs of new wooden boats.

    内河港口码头安上土机械  短途运输队伍装备车和船
    四川交通运输战线改革工具节约劳力提高效率
    本报成都20日电　四川交通运输部门针对短途运输中的港口码头装卸搬运这个薄弱环节，发动群众大闹技术革新，实现土机械化。目前，全省已有一百五十三个大小港口码头经过改造后，既加速了车船周转，又节约了大批劳力。仅以缩短木船装卸时间和提高航行效率计算，就等于全省增加了八万吨左右的木船装载能力，每月可多运二十五万吨物资。
    四川省内河众多，每年内河所担负的运量约占各种运输工具总运量的一半。许多集散物资的重要城镇都位于河口流域的三角地带；据不完全统计，全省现有三百多个港口码头，其中每年吞吐量在五万到三十万吨的有一百多个。但是，由于这些港口码头装卸搬运过去主要靠人背肩挑，因而占用劳力过多。全省从事港口码头装卸搬运的工人达十多万人，他们不仅劳动强度大，而且运输效率低，经常造成车船拥挤和物资积压，严重影响了水陆长途干线车船的运输能力。从全省情况看，港口码头装卸搬运已成为当前短途集散物资和整个交通运输中的一段“盲肠”。
    为了解决这个矛盾，四川省开展了一个以港口码头为中心，以缆车化、车子化、起重机化、溜槽化、输送带化等五化为主的装卸搬运土机械化的群众技术革新运动，要求做到快装快运快卸，使城镇港口码头实现“六通”：通工厂、通仓库、通堆栈、通车站、通船驳、通基本建设工地。川南水陆交通枢纽泸州市，车船多，运量大，每日输出物资达七千吨以上。全市原有三千多个搬运工人，整日挑、担、扛，仍不能适应长途干线运输的需要。土机械化的群众运动搞起来以后，全市仅在一个月内，就在长江和沱江港岸修建了各种土缆车、轨道、梭槽、溜杆等八十多条，总长一万三千七百多米；造出各种车子三百余辆，土起重机二十多台，同时还创造了畜力缆车、栈桥式活动码头，屋脊式和抽屉式卸车箱等新式工具，一般提高工效二倍到十倍。兰田坝码头运粮，改用牛拉缆车代替人力肩挑后，工效提高了三倍；轮船码头手摇过档机，每小时过煤八至十吨，比人力快四倍。由于全港已基本实现了“一化六通”，做到搬运快，车船周转快；物资积压现象已彻底清除。原来全市需要增加三千多个装卸搬运工人，现在不但不增加，反而从原有工人中抽调了一千人去支援其它工业部门。
    各地在大搞港口码头装卸搬运土机械化运动中，都坚决贯彻了以土为主、土洋结合、因地制宜、就地取材的方针。根据地形、物资品种、运量等条件来确定装卸搬运设备的类型与项目，深入发动群众，自力更生，战胜各种困难。达县群众运输站在实现八个码头装卸搬运土机械化的过程中，群众提出了八十五件重大的技术革新建议。
    由职工合力创制的空中巡回运输车，是根据码头坡度大小，插上高低不等的树桩，两侧安上横木，将运输车与横木衔接，套上绳子，借货物重量，上下循环绞运，每人每天能运货二万四千斤，工效提高五倍。同时还具有灵活、轻便、安全、不受自然条件限制等优点，不论日夜和风雨都可使用。
    目前，全省港口码头土机械化运动正在深入发展。已实现土机械化的一百多个大小港口码头，都相继成立了技术革新委员会或革新小组，不断研究改进现有工具，使劣变优，笨变巧，土变洋，弱变牢。同时特别注意各种工具的衔接配合和综合利用，以便使整个装卸搬运过程的各项作业都有机具，成为一个完整的港口码头装卸搬运体系。
    本报成都20日电　四川省正积极采取措施，千方百计装备短途运输队伍，力争在短期内实现车船机具化。
    迅速实现运输车船机具化，是四川省在当前短途运输战线上为增强运力，并使短途运输运动不断发展和巩固提高的一项重要措施。四川省目前已有一支一百一十多万人的短途运输队伍，10月份共集运物资七百一十六万吨，比9月份增加一倍以上。但是，他们中间60％的人还没有机具，运输效能远没有发挥。根据这个情况，四川省交通领导部门认为，如果把现有的运输队伍，再用二十万件车船机具武装起来，按最低的计算，估计可节约四十多万劳动力，对促进全省工农业继续跃进是大有好处的。
    为了迅速装备短途运输队伍，他们采取了修、抽、造的办法。修，就是把已损坏的工具迅速修复，并加强维护检修；抽就是把机关、学校、团体、居民、公社的自用运输工具，和副业车船，按照统筹兼顾的原则，抽调出来参加运输；造，就是根据生产的需要，大造各种适合于当地使用的车船。现在全省已有十多个专区、市（县）基本实现了运输车船机具化。
    实现车船机具化以后，不但节省运输力量，而且还大大提高了效率。南充专区平均每三人就有一辆车或一艘船，基本消灭了短途运输中人背肩挑的现象。这个区的华蓥山矿区在修造车子的同时，并积极修建各种道路，把矿区的各厂矿联成一片，使厂厂通公路，炉炉通架车、滑车，从而使矿区运输人员由原来的一万七千多人减为九千多人，运量比原来提高了30％以上。璧山县阴阳沟铁厂实现运输车子化后，每月节省运输劳力一千一百多个，减少各种运输费用一千四百多元。
    各地在大搞运输车船机具化中，都坚持贯彻群众路线，就地取材，寻找代用品，突破材料关。有的地方对散存在各机关团体和公社的库存物资进行了清查，把暂时不用的零件和呆滞材料收集起来，集中用于造车造船。中共乐山地委最近召开了公路和江河沿线人民公社造车造船专业会议，发动群众献计献策；岷江两岸四十二个公社提出保证，要在年底前造出一万多吨的木船。南充专区广安县造船缺铁钉，船工们就自动组织潜水队，把历年沉没在江底的船只打捞起来，回收了七十多吨铁件，满足了新造木船的需要。
