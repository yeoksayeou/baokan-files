Xinhua News Agency, 25th Dispatch: More than a thousand people from all walks of life in the capital solemnly held a rally this afternoon, enthusiastically responding to the call of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council to hold "Congo Day" and "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day," resolutely supporting the just struggle of the Congolese and African people for national independence and against colonialism.

The resolution passed at the conference stated: "The Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and resolutely supported the just struggle of the Congolese and African people. We will forever stand with the Congolese and African people to jointly struggle for the final end of colonial rule and lasting world peace." The resolution also stated: "U.S. imperialism is intensifying its continuous intrusion into Africa from political, economic, and military aspects, attempting to replace the position of colonialists such as Britain, France, and Belgium, and impose new colonial shackles on the African people. However, no matter how fierce and sinister imperialism is, their plans are doomed to fail. Imperialists must get out of Congo and get out of Africa. The African people must achieve complete liberation."

The conference was held in the auditorium of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). On the wall opposite the rostrum, a huge red banner with gold characters read: "Salute to the Congolese People Who are Heroically Struggling for National Independence!" The banners on both sides of the venue read: "Long Live the Great Unity of the Asian and African People!" "Long Live the Victory of the Anti-Colonialism Struggle!"

The conference began at 2:00 PM. Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, delivered the opening speech. He said that recently, the Congolese people's struggle against colonial rule and for national independence has developed extensively. At the same time, people in various parts of Africa have launched a vigorous anti-colonialism struggle. The struggle of the Congolese and African people is violently shaking the colonialists' rule in Africa, constantly striking at the imperialists' conspiracy to enslave and exploit the African people, and making a significant contribution to the cause of defending world peace. Let us pay the heroic Congolese and African people a lofty and fraternal tribute.

Liao Chengzhi said that imperialism is now carrying out bloody suppression and hypocritical deception against the Congolese and African people, attempting to maintain its criminal rule, especially U.S. imperialism, the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, is intensifying its use of despicable means to intrude into Africa from all aspects, in order to enslave and plunder the African people for a long time. However, the Congolese and African people's firm will to struggle is unshakable, and no massacre or conspiracy of imperialism can stop the Congolese and African people from moving towards independence and freedom. The just struggle of the Congolese and African people has received widespread support from powerful socialist countries and peace-loving and justice-upholding people around the world. We firmly believe that the Congolese and African people will be able to persist in their struggle, overcome all obstacles on the road forward, completely smash the aggression and oppression of imperialism headed by the United States, and achieve new and greater victories. The Chinese people will always stand firmly with the Congolese and African people to jointly struggle for the final burial of imperialist colonial rule and lasting world peace.

Next, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, delivered a speech (full text on page four). He paid a lofty and fraternal tribute to the heroic Congolese and African people on behalf of the Chinese people.

Guo Moruo emphasized that the Chinese people once again solemnly stated their firm support for the just struggle of the Congolese people for freedom and independence. The Chinese people severely condemn the crimes of the Belgian colonial rulers slaughtering the Congolese people with the help of U.S. imperialism, demanding that the Belgian colonialists immediately get out of Congo and give the Congolese people independence and freedom.

When analyzing the international situation, Guo Moruo said that the current development of the international situation is increasingly favorable to peace and unfavorable to war; favorable to the people of the world and unfavorable to imperialism. He said that while the flames of anti-colonialism are sweeping the entire African continent, we are also pleased to see that the people in other parts of the world are also experiencing a magnificent development in their struggles against the plunder and control of U.S. imperialism, for the defense of national independence, and for democracy. He said that the Chinese people fully support the Japanese people's struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and for the further abolition of this treaty, and warmly congratulate this struggle for achieving new and greater victories. The Latin American people's struggle to safeguard national independence and strive for democracy is unprecedentedly high, which makes U.S. imperialism feel panicked. Let our conference express our heartfelt respect to the Latin American people who are carrying out a heroic struggle to safeguard national independence, strive for democratic freedom, and oppose U.S. aggression and plunder.

Guo Moruo said that facts have proved that U.S. imperialism is the common and most ferocious enemy of the national independence movement and the world peace and democracy movement in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the entire world. Therefore, people of all countries, all nationalities, and all strata around the world are uniting under the banner of defending peace, forming the broadest united front against imperialism and colonialism headed by the United States. The powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union stands at the forefront of peace and is the main force for world peace. They have always firmly supported all just causes against imperialism and for the defense of national independence.

Guo Moruo then emphasized that not long ago, Comrade Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, visited the United States, making a tremendous contribution to easing international tensions. Facing the powerful peace forces of the people of the world, the U.S. authorities were forced to make some easing gestures. This fact shows the great victory of the peace forces. However, U.S. imperialism has not abandoned its policy of aggression and war, and still opposes socialist countries, opposes the national democratic movement, and opposes the world peace movement.

The U.S. ruling clique has recently been shamelessly talking about peace, but it is just deliberately releasing a smoke screen to divert the target, paralyze and weaken the world people's will to fight against imperialism and strive for peace, and ease the internal contradictions of the imperialist bloc, as a delaying tactic for it to deceive the American people's votes and further expand arms and prepare for war. We must not be paralyzed by this new conspiracy of U.S. imperialism, and we must not relax the struggle against U.S. war forces and for the defense of peace. We must thoroughly expose the peace mask of U.S. war forces.

Guo Moruo said that U.S. imperialism has always been hostile to the Chinese people. In the face of the united Chinese people, all hostile activities of U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people have been shamefully defeated. In recent years, our country's economic construction has achieved leapfrog progress, and a new situation of great leaps in industrial and agricultural production and the great development of people's communes has emerged. Under these circumstances, U.S. imperialism has tried every means to use the most despicable slanders and the most vicious libels to undermine our country's international prestige, provoke friendly relations between our country and Asian, African, and other countries, and attempt to oppose the Chinese people in all aspects. However, any sinister provocation and vicious curses of U.S. imperialism cannot shake a hair of ours. We want to solemnly warn the U.S. imperialists: Your trickery cannot deceive the Chinese people, nor can it deceive the people of the world.

Guo Moruo said that we Chinese people firmly defend peace in the Far East and the world. We have always deeply sympathized with and firmly supported the just struggle of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to strive for and safeguard national independence and oppose the aggressive forces headed by U.S. imperialism. Under any circumstances, the Chinese people will always stand firmly with them.

Guo Moruo said that the Chinese people will never invade others, but we will never allow others to invade ourselves. The Chinese people love peace, but we will never yield to any aggressor, nor will we beg for peace from war provocateurs. The Chinese people are willing to join hands more closely with all peace-loving people in the world to jointly struggle to eliminate the threat of imperialist war and strive for lasting peace.

Also speaking at today's conference were Li Jiebo, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Shi Liang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China, and Zhang Chao, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation. They expressed their firm support and high respect for the heroic struggle of the Congolese and African workers, women, youth, and all the people for independence and freedom, severely condemned the crimes of imperialism in implementing cruel rule and bloody suppression against the Congolese and African people, and demanded that the Belgian colonialists get out of Congo and that the imperialists get out of Africa.

Li Jiebo said that the Chinese working class and people once suffered the same long-term and cruel oppression and exploitation by imperialism. Therefore, we have a deep understanding of the situation of the African people. The heroic struggle of the African people, especially the African working class, has gained the deep sympathy of the entire Chinese people and the Chinese working class. We firmly believe that as long as the people of all African countries are united and join hands with the working class and people of all countries in the world to fight tenaciously and unyieldingly, they will, like us in China and many other people who were once under colonial rule, smash the chains of colonialism and achieve final liberation.

Shi Liang said that now the entire African continent has ignited a torch of striving for independence and freedom, illuminating the road forward for the African people. What we especially admire is that an increasing number of women in these regions are participating in the struggle for independence and freedom. The Congolese and African people and women who have stood up will never be intimidated by armed suppression, nor will they be deceived by the imperialists' conspiracy to actually continue their aggression under the guise of "peace" and "granting independence."

Zhang Chao said that the vicious U.S. imperialism, under the deceptive banner of "opposing colonialism," is trying every means to replace the ruling position of old colonialists such as Britain, France, and Belgium in Africa. We believe that the African people and youth will never tolerate the aggression of U.S. imperialism. They will oppose U.S. neo-colonialism in the same way that they oppose old colonialists such as Britain, France, and Belgium. They will drive all imperialists out of the African continent.

These speeches won round after round of stormy and enthusiastic applause from the audience.

The conference finally unanimously passed a resolution firmly supporting the struggle of the Congolese and African people for national independence and against colonialism. When the resolution was passed, thunderous applause once again resounded throughout the venue for a long time.

Today's conference was jointly sponsored by the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, The All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China, and the All-China Youth Federation. Various people's organizations and many famous peace activists attended the conference, including Chen Shutong, Bao Erhan, Zhang Xiruo, Chu Tunan, Qu Tangliang, and Zhu Ziqi.

Foreign guests and students from Cameroon, Uganda, Chad, the United Arab Republic, North Korea, Japan, India, Thailand, New Zealand, Chile, and other countries in Beijing were invited to attend today's conference. (Attached photo)

    为埋葬殖民主义统治和争取世界持久和平而共同奋斗
    中国人民支持刚果和非洲人民
    首都各界集会谴责比利时殖民者在美国帮助下屠杀刚果人民的罪行  揭露美国企图把新的殖民主义的枷锁套在非洲人民身上的凶恶阴谋
    据新华社25日讯　首都各界人民一千多人今天下午隆重举行集会，热烈响应亚非人民团结理事会关于举行“刚果日”和“帝国主义滚出非洲日”的号召，坚决支持刚果和非洲人民争取民族独立、反对殖民主义的正义斗争。
    在大会通过的决议中说：“中国人民一贯深切同情和坚决支持刚果和非洲人民的正义斗争，我们将永远与刚果和非洲人民站在一起，为最后结束殖民主义统治和争取世界持久和平而共同奋斗。”决议又说：“美帝国主义，正加紧从政治、经济、军事等方面不断侵入非洲，企图代替英国、法国、比利时等殖民主义者的地位，把新的殖民主义的枷锁套在非洲人民的身上。但是，不管帝国主义如何凶恶和阴险，它们的计划是注定要失败的。帝国主义者必须滚出刚果，滚出非洲。非洲人民一定要获得彻底的解放。”
    大会在政协礼堂举行。会场主席台对面墙壁上，高悬巨幅红底金字标语：“向为争取民族独立而英勇斗争的刚果人民致敬！”会场两旁的标语上写道：“帝国主义滚出非洲！”“亚非人民大团结万岁！反殖民主义斗争胜利万岁！”
    大会在下午二时开始。中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志致开会词。他说，最近以来，刚果人民反对殖民统治和争取民族独立的斗争有了广泛的发展，同时，非洲各地人民掀起了轰轰烈烈的反殖民主义斗争。刚果和非洲人民的斗争猛烈地震撼着殖民主义者在非洲的统治，不断打击着帝国主义奴役和压榨非洲人民的阴谋，对保卫世界和平事业作出了重大的贡献。让我们向英勇的刚果和非洲人民致以崇高的、兄弟的敬意。
    廖承志说，现在帝国主义正在对刚果和非洲人民进行血腥的镇压和伪善的欺骗，妄图维持其罪恶的统治，特别是美帝国主义，这个世界人民最凶恶的敌人，正加紧用可耻的手段，从各方面侵入非洲，以便长期奴役和掠夺非洲人民。但是，刚果和非洲人民坚强的斗争意志是不可动摇的，帝国主义的任何屠杀和阴谋活动也阻挡不了刚果和非洲人民走向独立和自由。刚果和非洲人民的正义斗争得到了强大的社会主义国家和全世界爱好和平和主持正义的人民的广泛支持。我们深信，刚果和非洲人民一定能够坚持斗争，克服前进道路上的一切障碍，彻底粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略和压迫，取得新的、更伟大的胜利。中国人民将永远与刚果和非洲人民坚定地站在一起，为最后埋葬帝国主义殖民统治和争取世界持久和平而共同奋斗。
    接着，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若讲话（全文见第四版），他以中国人民的名义向英勇的刚果人民和非洲人民致以崇高的、兄弟的敬意。
    郭沫若强调指出，中国人民再一次郑重表明，坚决支持刚果人民争取自由和独立的正义斗争。中国人民严厉谴责比利时殖民统治者在美帝国主义帮助下屠杀刚果人民的罪行，要求比利时殖民者立即滚出刚果，给刚果人民以独立和自由。
    郭沫若在分析国际形势的时候说，当前国际局势的发展，愈来愈有利于和平而不利于战争；有利于世界人民而不利于帝国主义。他说，在反殖民主义的怒火燃遍整个非洲大陆的同时，我们还高兴地看到，世界其他地区的人民反对美帝国主义的掠夺和控制、维护民族独立、争取民主的斗争也正波澜壮阔地向前发展。他说，中国人民完全支持日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”并进一步废除这一条约的斗争，热烈祝贺这一斗争获得新的、更大的胜利。拉丁美洲人民维护民族独立、争取民主的斗争空前高涨，这使美帝国主义感到惊慌失措。让我们的大会向为维护民族独立、争取民主自由、反对美国侵略和掠夺而进行着英勇斗争的拉丁美洲人民表示衷心的敬意。
    郭沫若说，事实证明，美帝国主义是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界民族独立运动和世界和平民主运动的共同的、最凶恶的敌人。因此，全世界各国、各民族、各阶层的人民正在保卫和平的旗帜下，结成了最广泛的统一战线，反对以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义。以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营站在和平的最前列，是世界和平的主力军。他们一贯坚决支持一切反对帝国主义和维护民族独立的正义事业。
    郭沫若接着强调地说，不久以前，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志访问美国，对于缓和国际紧张局势作出了巨大贡献。面对着世界人民强大的和平力量，美国当局被迫作出了某些缓和的姿态，这个事实显示了和平力量的重大胜利。然而，美帝国主义并没有放弃它的侵略政策和战争政策，依然敌视社会主义国家，敌视民族民主运动，敌视世界和平运动。
    美国统治集团最近以来大言不惭地侈谈和平，不过是故意放出一片烟幕来转移目标，麻痹和削弱世界人民反对帝国主义和争取和平的斗志，缓和帝国主义集团的内部矛盾，以作为它骗取美国人民的选票和进一步扩军备战的缓兵之计而已。我们决不能为美帝国主义这一新的阴谋所麻痹，决不能放松反对美国战争势力和保卫和平的斗争，必须彻底揭露美国战争势力的和平假面具。
    郭沫若说，美帝国主义一贯敌视中国人民。在团结一致的中国人民面前，美帝国主义对中国人民的一切敌对活动都遭到了可耻的失败。几年来，我国经济建设获得了飞跃进展，出现了工农业生产大跃进和人民公社的大发展的新局面。在这种情况下，美国帝国主义又千方百计地用最卑鄙的诬蔑和最恶毒的诽谤来破坏我国的国际威望，挑拨我国同亚非国家和其他国家之间的友好关系，企图从各方面来反对中国人民。但是，美帝国主义任何阴险的挑拨和恶毒的咒骂都动摇不了我们的一根毫毛。我们要严正警告美帝国主义者：你那一套手法骗不了中国人民，也骗不了世界人民。
    郭沫若说，我们中国人民坚决保卫远东和世界和平。我们一贯深切同情和坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲争取和维护民族独立、反对以美帝国主义为首的侵略势力的正义斗争。无论在任何情况下，中国人民都永远和他们坚定地站在一起。
    郭沫若说，中国人民绝不侵略别人，但也绝不容许别人侵略自己。中国人民热爱和平，但是我们绝不向任何侵略者屈服，也绝不向战争挑拨者乞求和平。中国人民愿意同世界上一切爱好和平的人民更紧密地携起手来，为消除帝国主义战争威胁和争取持久和平而共同奋斗。
    在今天大会上讲话的，还有中华全国总工会副主席李颉伯、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会副主席史良、中华全国青年联合会副主席张超。他们对于刚果和非洲工人、妇女、青年和全体人民争取独立自由的英勇斗争，表示坚决的支持和崇高的敬意，严厉谴责帝国主义对刚果和非洲人民实行残酷统治和血腥镇压的罪行，并且要求比利时殖民主义者滚出刚果去，要求帝国主义者滚出非洲去。
    李颉伯说，中国工人阶级和人民过去曾经同样遭受到帝国主义长期的残酷压迫和剥削。因此，对非洲人民的境遇有着深刻的体会。非洲人民尤其是非洲工人阶级的英勇斗争，得到了全中国人民和中国工人阶级的深刻同情。我们坚信，非洲各国人民只要团结一致，并且同世界各国工人阶级和人民携起手来，百折不挠地顽强地斗争，他们一定会像我们中国和其他许多过去受殖民统治的人民一样，粉碎殖民主义的锁链，获得最后的解放。
    史良说，现在整个的非洲大陆已经高燃起争取独立和自由的火炬，照亮了非洲人民前进的道路。尤其使我们钦佩的是，这些地区的妇女日益众多地参加到争取独立自由的斗争中来。已经站立起来的刚果和非洲人民和妇女，他们绝不是武装镇压所能吓倒的，也不是帝国主义借着“和平”和“恩赐独立”的幌子实际上继续进行侵略的阴谋所能蒙蔽的。
    张超说，凶狠的美帝国主义打着“反对殖民主义”的骗人的旗号，正千方百计企图取代英国、法国、比利时等老牌殖民主义在非洲的统治地位。我们相信，非洲人民和青年绝不会容忍美帝国主义的侵略，他们一定会像反对英国、法国、比利时等老牌殖民主义一样来反对美国新殖民主义，他们一定会把一切帝国主义赶出非洲大陆。
    这些讲话博得了全场一阵又一阵暴风雨般的热烈掌声。
    大会最后一致通过决议，坚决支持刚果和非洲人民争取民族独立、反对殖民主义的斗争。在通过决议的时候，春雷般的掌声再一次长久地响彻着会场。
    今天的大会由中国亚非团结委员会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中华全国总工会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会、中华全国青年联合会联合主办。各人民团体和许多著名的和平人士参加了大会，他们当中有陈叔通、包尔汉、张奚若、楚图南、区棠亮、朱子奇等。
    在北京的喀麦隆、乌干达、乍得、阿联、朝鲜、日本、印度、泰国、新西兰、智利等国的外宾和留学生，应邀出席了今天的大会。（附图片）
