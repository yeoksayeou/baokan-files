    Numbers and Facts
    In October, the number of large and medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide with a monthly average utilization coefficient (tons of iron produced per cubic meter of furnace volume per day) of more than 2 tons increased from six in September to nine.
    In October, converter utilization coefficient: No. 1 workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 reached 39.098; open hearth furnace utilization coefficient: small open hearth furnace of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 reached 15.632; electric furnace utilization coefficient: Benxi Iron and Steel Company reached 40.085. If the open hearth furnaces, converters, and electric furnaces of the key iron and steel enterprises across the country can all reach this advanced level, they can increase steel production by more than 25,000 tons per day.
    After liberation, the utilization coefficient of large and medium-sized blast furnaces in our country increased from 0.62 tons in 1949 to 1.023 tons in 1952 in just over four years. The small blast furnaces in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Zhejiang, and Yunnan provinces, which were born during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, now have a monthly average utilization coefficient of over one ton, completing in one year the journey that large and medium-sized blast furnaces took four years to complete in the past.

    数字与事实
    10月份，全国大、中型高炉全月平均利用系数（每立方米高炉容积一昼夜的产铁量）在2吨以上的炉子，从9月份的六座增加到九座。
    10月份，转炉利用系数：上海钢铁厂三厂一车间达到39.098；平炉利用系数：上海钢铁厂三厂小平炉达到15.632，电炉利用系数：本溪钢铁公司达到40.085。全国重点钢铁企业的平炉、转炉、电炉如果都能达到这个先进水平，每天可以增产钢二万五千多吨。
    解放后，我国大、中型高炉在四年多的时间内，利用系数从1949年的0.62吨提高到1952年的1.023吨。在1958年大跃进中诞生的江苏、安徽、山东、浙江、云南五个省的小高炉现在月平均利用系数已经达到一吨以上，一年走完了大、中型高炉在过去曾经用四年走完的路程。
