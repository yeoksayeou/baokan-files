Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd. People's communes in Shandong Province are actively strengthening wheat field management to achieve no missing seedlings or broken rows, no pests, and no third-class seedlings. The broad masses of commune members are determined to eliminate all weak and yellow seedlings before the ground freezes, laying a good foundation for a bumper wheat harvest next year.

As of the 16th of this month, more than seven million mu of wheat fields with missing seedlings and broken rows across the province have been basically filled through transplanting and replanting to achieve full stands. More than 7.6 million mu of wheat fields in the province have been topdressed, an increase of more than 70% over the same period last year. In early November, Shandong Province experienced widespread welcome rainfall, improving soil moisture in wheat fields. However, the area of irrigated wheat fields in various regions still increased by 1.52 million mu compared to last year. Wheat rust and insect pests that occurred in some areas have also been controlled in a timely manner. Due to the tight and early focus on wheat field management, the number of third-class wheat fields in the province this year has been greatly reduced compared to last year.

This year, before wheat planting was even completed, Shandong launched a field management campaign to eliminate third-class seedlings and promote and improve first and second-class wheat seedlings through a comprehensive wheat field survey. After surveying wheat fields for fertilization, missing seedlings, watering, and excessive growth, the Liaocheng Special District clarified the blindly optimistic sentiment of some people and strengthened wheat field management in a timely manner, rolling and compacting all 3 million mu of excessively grown wheat and watering and topdressing more than 3 million mu. In the Changwei Special District, 450,000 farmers participating in wheat field management launched a shock competition to eliminate third-class seedlings. Within a few days, more than 200,000 mu of third-class wheat in the special district had been watered and topdressed.

In wheat field management, various regions have generally analyzed and categorized wheat fields, adopting different measures for processing and management based on different growth conditions. They have also generally established specialized wheat field management organizations, implemented methods of assigning personnel, work points, plots, and targets, and established a wheat field management archive system. These methods have played a significant role in promoting wheat field management.

This newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd. Jiangsu has organized area and quality inspection teams at all levels, going deep into the fields, mobilizing the masses, and making every effort to ensure the comprehensive over-fulfillment of autumn sowing tasks.

This year, the quality of autumn sowing in Jiangsu is better than last year, and the progress is faster. As of the 12th of this month, summer-ripening crops have been sown on more than 96% of the original plan, which is more than 9.6 million mu more than the actual harvested area this summer.

While basically completing the autumn sowing tasks, various regions have mobilized cadres and commune members at all levels to conduct in-depth and meticulous inspection and verification of the sown area. Many cadres and commune members have loudly proposed the battle cry of "seizing time, ensuring area, not giving up a single fen," adopting methods of checking by teams, inspecting every field, and registering block by block. If the sown area is found to be insufficient, measures are immediately taken to replant. At the end of autumn sowing, the Jiangpu County Party Committee organized an inspection team to go deep into the Da'alu Brigade of the Dougang Commune to inspect and found that the area sown with grain and oil crops was less than the planned area. The county party committee immediately organized cadres and commune members throughout the county to inspect and verify the area, and promptly replanted more than 56,000 mu of summer-ripening crops. The Bajiji Commune in Pi County originally planned to sow 4,900 mu, but after inspection and verification, it was found that 87 mu were under-sown. After arranging stubble, in addition to making up the planned area, another 40 mu were expanded, over-fulfilling the autumn sowing task.

Many areas that have already completed the autumn sowing tasks are tapping the potential of the land in various ways and making every effort to expand the autumn sowing area. After completing the autumn sowing task, Dafeng County mobilized more than 20,000 people to expand the planting of wheat, rapeseed, beans, and green manure crops by more than 26,000 mu by utilizing ditch edges and corners, and cultivate 3.6 million "rapeseed kings." Tongshan, Xinyi, Ganyu, and Pei counties in the Xuzhou Special District have expanded wheat planting on vacant land by more than 120,000 mu.

In southern Jiangsu, where the season is later, they are actively expanding the area of late-planted crops in conjunction with land leveling, soil improvement, and the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects. According to statistics from some communes in Kunshan, Wuxi, Changshu, Wujiang, and other counties in the Suzhou Special District, due to the removal of field ridges, filling small pits and ditches, and combining small fields into large fields, the cultivated area has been expanded by more than 27,000 mu.

### 追肥　浇水　除虫　查苗　补种  山东三类麦苗大大减少  江苏各地查面积、查质量，保证超额完成秋播计划

    追肥　浇水　除虫　查苗　补种
    山东三类麦苗大大减少
    江苏各地查面积、查质量，保证超额完成秋播计划
    新华社济南23日电　山东省各地人民公社正在为实现小麦无缺苗断垅、无虫害、无三类苗，积极加强麦田管理。广大社员决心要把一切瘦弱黄苗消灭在封冻以前，为明年小麦丰收打下良好基础。
    截至本月16日，全省七百多万亩缺苗断垅的小麦，通过移栽、补种，基本达到全苗；全省经过追肥的麦田已有七百六十多万亩，比去年同期增加70％以上。11月初，山东省曾普降喜雨，麦田墒情较好，但各地水浇麦田比去年仍增加了一百五十二万亩。部分地区发生的小麦锈病和虫害，也都及时进行了防治。由于各地对麦田管理工作抓得紧搞得早，今年全省的三类麦田比去年大大减少。
    今年山东各地在种麦还没结束的时候，就通过麦田大普查展开了消灭三类苗，促进、提高一、二类麦苗的田间管理活动。聊城专区经过查麦田施肥、查缺苗、查浇水、查陡长后，澄清了部分人的盲目乐观情绪，及时加强了麦田管理，给全区陡长的三百多万亩小麦全部作了砘压，有三百多万亩浇了水和施了追肥。昌潍专区参加麦田管理的四十五万农民展开了突击消灭三类苗的竞赛，全专区几天之内已有二十多万亩三类麦浇了水、追了肥。
    在麦田管理工作中，各地普遍对麦田作分析站队，根据不同生长情况采取不同的措施加工管理，普遍建立了麦田管理专业组织，推行了定人员、定工分、定地块、定指标的办法，建立麦田管理的档案制度。这些办法，对推动麦田管理工作，起了很大的作用。
    本报南京23日电　江苏各地层层组织秋播面积、质量检查组，深入到田，发动群众，千方百计保证全面超额完成秋播任务。
    今年江苏秋播的质量比去年更好，进度比去年更快，到本月12日止，已播种夏熟作物占原计划96％以上，比今年夏季实收面积多种了九百六十多万亩。
    在基本完成秋播任务时，各地层层发动干部社员，深入细致地检查、核实播种面积。许多干部社员响亮地提出“抢时间、保面积，分厘不让”的战斗口号，采取队队检查，丘丘过目，逐块登记的办法，发现播种面积不足，立即采取措施补播。中共江浦县委在秋播结束时，组织检查组深入到陡岗公社大芦大队检验，发现播种的粮油作物面积少于计划面积。县委立即组织全县干部社员检查核实面积，及时补种了五万六千多亩夏熟作物。邳县八集公社原计划播种四千九百亩，检查核实后，发现少种八十七亩。经过安排茬口，除补足计划面积外，又扩种四十亩，超额完成了秋播任务。
    许多已经完成秋播任务的地区，都从各个方面挖掘土地潜力，千方百计扩大秋播面积。大丰县在完成秋播任务后，全县出动两万多人，利用沟边地角，扩种麦子、油菜、豆子、绿肥作物二万六千多亩，培植“油菜王”三百六十万棵。徐州专区的铜山、新沂、赣榆、沛县等四县已利用空地扩种麦子十二万多亩。
    季节较晚的苏南地区，结合平整土地、改良土壤和兴修小型水利，积极扩大晚茬面积。据苏州专区的昆山、无锡、常熟、吴江等县部分公社统计，由于拆除田埂、垫平小坑、小沟，小田并大田，已扩大耕种面积二万七千多亩。（附图片）
