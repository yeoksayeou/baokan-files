    10 × 480 = 7700
    Communist Youth League Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee, Xi Shen

    Dear readers, you must be surprised after reading this calculation problem. 10 × 480 can only equal 4800. Even the most brilliant mathematician cannot arrive at the conclusion of 7700. However, this is indeed a genuine fact.

    This calculation problem comes from the machine workshop of the Zhangjiakou Exploration Machinery Factory.

    Calculated on an eight-hour workday, one person has 480 minutes of production time in a day, and ten people can only produce tasks worth 4800 minutes. However, ten young men in this workshop were not willing to lag behind, determined to do more work with these 4800 minutes. Thus, ten people jointly posted a big-character poster asking "10 × 480 equals how much?" In order to find the answer to this calculation problem, these ten young men united to help and challenge each other. As a result, they completed 7700 minutes of work in 4800 minutes. They used the answer to tell everyone: their ten young men achieved a collective leap forward, defeating Father Time.

    No wonder people say, "The old almanac is useless." It is indeed so. Anyone who observes our era, where one day equals twenty years, with the old almanac will surely suffer a bloody nose. Who says that launching mass movements will cause chaos? If there is chaos, it can only disrupt the old balance and the old production order that does not adapt to the new situation; it can only disrupt a conclusion of 10 × 480 equaling 7700, or even a number greater than 7700.

    So, what does 10 × 480 equaling 7700 demonstrate? It demonstrates the correctness of the General Line; it demonstrates the Chinese people's unwillingness to accept the situation of being economically poor and blank, and their ambition to accelerate socialist construction; it demonstrates that conditions are dead, but people are alive, and living people always prevail over dead things; it demonstrates that people are the decisive factor in our great era; it demonstrates that as long as we dare to think and act, dare to fight against difficulties, we will surely overcome them.

    Improving production is endless. "Make progress every day, ascend step by step" is always the slogan of us promoters. On the road forward, we must certainly oppose pride, but we must also oppose the idea of ​​"contentment brings happiness." Only in this way can we achieve greater leaps forward.

    Now is a good time. There is still more than a month to bid farewell to 1959. Let us seize the time with the spirit of seizing every minute and second!

    10×480＝7700

    亲爱的读者，你看了这道算题以后，一定感到惊奇吧。10×480只能等于4800，多么高明的数学家也得不出等于7700这个结论的。但是，这确是一个千真万确的事实。
    这道算题出在张家口探机厂机械车间。
    按八小时工作计算，一个人一天有480分钟的生产时间，十个人只能生产4800分的任务。可是，这个车间有十个青年小伙子，他们不甘居下游，决心要用这4800分钟干更多的活，于是十个人联合贴出一张“10×480等于多少”的大字报。为了给这道算题得出答案，这十个小伙子又联合在一起互相帮助，互相挑战，结果用4800分钟的时间干了7700分钟的活，用答案告诉大家：他们十个小伙子实现了集体飞跃，战胜了时间老人。
    不怪人们说：“旧皇历不能用了”，确是如此。谁要是拿着旧皇历来观察我们一天等于二十年的时代，那他非碰得头破血流不可。谁说大搞群众运动会出乱子，如果出乱子，只能打乱旧的平衡、旧的不适应新形势的生产秩序；只能乱出一个10×480等于7700的结论，甚至得出一个比7700更大的数字。
    那么10×480等于7700说明什么呢？它说明总路线的正确；说明我国人民不甘心国民经济一穷二白的情况，要努力加快社会主义建设的雄心大志；说明条件是死的，人是活的，活的人永远胜于死的物；说明人是我们伟大时代的决定因素；说明只要敢想敢干、敢于和困难搏斗，就一定能战胜困难。
    提高生产是无止境的，“天天向上，步步登高”，永远是我们促进派的口号，在前进的道路上我们固然要反对骄傲，但我们更要反对“知足常乐”的思想，只有这样，我们才能实现更大的跃进。
    现在时机很好，还有一个多月就要送别1959年了，让我们用争分夺秒的气势争取时间吧！
