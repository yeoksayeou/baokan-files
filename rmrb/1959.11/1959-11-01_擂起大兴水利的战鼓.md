The prelude to a nationwide water conservancy construction movement has begun. Since the issuance of the instructions from the Party Central Committee and the State Council on October 24 regarding the continued large-scale development of water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation this winter and next spring, the enthusiasm of the broad masses has been further heightened, their fighting spirit has become more vigorous, and their confidence and courage in undertaking large-scale water conservancy and transforming nature have greatly increased. Various localities have generally revised their plans for water conservancy construction this winter and next spring, established specialized organizations, and strengthened leadership over water conservancy construction, with the Party committee secretary taking personal command. Currently, more than 30 million labor troops across the country have set out for the water conservancy front. This year's water conservancy movement is characterized by the great determination of the leadership and the strong enthusiasm of the masses, and it has appeared in a Great Leap Forward posture from the very beginning.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago that "water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture." The Party Central Committee and the State Council also pointed out in their instructions of October 24 that "water conservancy remains the fundamental problem in developing agricultural production." The threat of water and drought disasters to China's agricultural production is widespread and serious. According to historical records, from 206 BC to 1936 AD, a period of 2,142 years, there were a total of 1,031 major floods and 1,060 droughts, averaging almost one major flood or drought per year. It can be said that the history of the development of agricultural production in China for thousands of years has been a history of the broad masses of farmers fighting against frequent water and drought disasters. However, in the past, during the rule of the exploiting classes, such struggles could not exert their great power. Therefore, after thousands of years of long years and hard work by our ancestors, by the time of liberation, the country had only 240 million mu of irrigated land. After liberation, the working people became the masters of the country, and millions of farmers, under the leadership of the Party, launched a comprehensive offensive against nature, putting forward the bold slogan: "Turn water hazards into water conservancy," and "Get grain from water!" In a short period of ten years, we have harnessed hundreds of large and small rivers, built hundreds of thousands of large and small reservoirs, and expanded the irrigated area to 1.07 billion mu. These water conservancy constructions have ensured the continuous increase in agricultural production in our country. In particular, the water conservancy projects built during the water conservancy upsurge that began in the winter of 1957 have continuously resisted the two serious water and drought disasters of last year and this year, and won unprecedented bumper harvests in agriculture. This year, severe drought occurred in seventeen provinces in central China. The scope of the drought and its severity were equivalent to or even exceeded the six major droughts that occurred between 1928 and 1944. The result of the six major droughts in the past was barren land, no harvest, families scattered, and homes destroyed. In Henan Province alone, 3 million people died in the great drought of 1942. This year, we relied on the powerful strength of the people's communes and the power of the water conservancy projects built since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, to overcome the extraordinary drought. The most severely affected areas, such as Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu, still achieved bumper harvests. Heavy rains in Hebei and Beijing caused serious disasters, exceeding the situation in 1949. In the great flood of 1949, more than 40 million mu of land were flooded in Hebei; this year, due to the construction of water conservancy, the affected area was reduced by half, and the severity of the disaster was also reduced. In such a year of great disasters this year, the total output of grain and cotton in our country can still increase by about 10% on the basis of last year's extraordinary leap forward. Farmland water conservancy construction can not only defend against the threat of water and drought disasters, but more importantly, comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Constitution," combined with a large increase in fertilizer application, deep plowing of land, promotion of improved varieties, and rational close planting, etc., can rapidly increase the yield per unit area and total output. According to many typical surveys, it can generally increase production by about 50% to one time, and in some areas it can increase production by two or three times. For example, after water conservancy construction in the Yongxi Yunjiang Irrigation Area in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the output increased from 1 million jin to 5 million jin.

Although we have achieved unprecedented achievements in water conservancy construction, we cannot be satisfied with this achievement. Because under such vast conditions and such complex natural conditions in our country, tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of mu of land are still subject to varying degrees of water and drought disasters every year, affecting the stability of agricultural production increase and threatening the development of the entire national economy and the safety of people's lives. To ensure the continued leap forward of agricultural production and the entire national economy, it is necessary to vigorously develop water conservancy so that agricultural production can quickly get rid of the threat of water and drought disasters. Therefore, the Party Central Committee and the State Council clearly pointed out in the instructions issued on October 24 regarding the continued large-scale development of water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation this winter and next spring: "In the next few winters and springs, we will carry out several more water conservancy construction upsurges and strive to achieve water conservancy in a relatively short period of time. This is a major task for the whole party and the whole people to build socialism." Specifically, it is to call on the whole party and the whole people to continue to fight hard, and to organize several more large-scale water conservancy construction upsurges, and strive to basically control water and drought disasters in general areas across the country and realize the water conservancy requirements in the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

In order to complete the above tasks, we must adhere to the "three main" policies of giving priority to water storage, giving priority to small-scale projects, and giving priority to self-management by the masses. Using the spirit of giving priority to water storage to manage water can not only eliminate water and drought disasters, but also comprehensively develop and utilize water resources, turning water hazards into water conservancy and meeting the water needs of crops at various times. At the same time, it can also develop power generation, shipping, and aquaculture. Small-scale projects are projects that cost less and produce faster results. They are the foundation for cultivating water sources and protecting large and medium-sized projects. However, with small-scale projects, there must also be necessary large and medium-sized projects to control floods in large and medium-sized rivers. The combination of large, medium, and small projects can form a complete water conservancy project system in which surface water and groundwater are mutually used, so that the benefits of water conservancy projects can be maximized and it is possible to resist large floods and droughts and ensure stable agricultural production. In addition to giving priority to small-scale and water storage, water conservancy construction must also give priority to self-management by the masses. Because the scope of water conservancy construction is wide and the quantity is large, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses and rely on the masses to solve problems such as manpower, materials, funds, and technology.

It should be recognized that the "three main" policies are the summary of the Party's experience in conducting mass movements in water conservancy construction, and are the specific policies for implementing the Party's general line of socialist construction in water conservancy construction. In the first eight years, Changning County, Hunan, only built 60 small reservoirs and one medium-sized reservoir. After implementing the "three main" policies, in 1958, it built more than 700 reservoirs. In the past, Laibin County, Guangxi, spent about 20 yuan per mu to build water conservancy, but in 1958 it averaged less than 1 yuan. On a national scale, the implementation of the "three main" policies has resulted in the construction of 49 large reservoirs, which is four and a half times the number of large reservoirs built in the eight years after liberation; 1,470 medium-sized reservoirs, which is more than four times the number in the previous eight years; and 3,000 large irrigation areas with a benefited area of more than 10,000 mu, which is more than twice the number in the previous eight years; a total of more than 70 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work, which is seven times the number in the previous eight years; and an expansion of the irrigated area of 550 million mu, which is more than twice the number in the previous eight years; Preliminary treatment of 210 million mu of low-lying waterlogged areas, preliminary control of soil erosion area of 400,000 square kilometers, and development of 2.4 million horsepower of mechanical drainage and irrigation. These facts irrefutably prove the correctness of the "three main" policies. In the future water conservancy construction, as the needs of production development increase, the water conservancy movement will naturally develop to a higher stage, the scale of water conservancy construction will develop from small to large, the organization will develop from decentralized to unified, and the standards will develop from low to high. This is the trend of water conservancy construction development. However, the "three main" policies must still be implemented to the end.

The implementation of the "three main" policies now has particularly favorable conditions, and that is that the people's communes are more consolidated. The people's communes have exerted great power in water conservancy construction, as the Party Central Committee and the State Council pointed out on October 24: "The people's commune is a new foundation for the water conservancy movement, bringing many new features to the water conservancy movement: it is convenient to host larger backbone projects, making large, medium and small water conservancy projects combined; it is convenient to connect the past scattered and isolated projects to form a more complete irrigation and drainage system; it is convenient to combine the management of large rivers and rivers to conduct the planning and comprehensive development of small and medium river basins; it is convenient to unify the allocation of labor, organize large cooperation and large-scale operations under the principle of mutual assistance, mutual benefit and equivalent exchange; it is convenient to unify the allocation of water sources, promote planned water use, strengthen irrigation management, and realize gardenization, etc." People's communes can not only build small-scale projects in large quantities, but also build medium-sized and even large-scale projects under the policy of self-management by the masses and state support. Taking medium-sized projects as an example, during the nine years before communization, a total of 717 projects were built across the country, storing 10.3 billion cubic meters of water; in the year after communization, 1,078 projects were built, storing 20.8 billion cubic meters of water, twice the water storage capacity before communization. Building large-scale projects mainly by the masses was almost unimaginable in the past, but it has also become a reality after communization. As reported on the fourth page of this newspaper yesterday: Linyi Prefecture, Shandong, has built six large reservoirs with a storage capacity of more than 200 million cubic meters in the past year, which is the most prominent example. The six large reservoirs in Linyi Prefecture, such as Xujia Cliff, Rizhao, Tangcun, and Huibaoling, started construction in the autumn of 1958 while rushing to harvest autumn crops, sowing autumn crops, and vigorously developing iron and steel. After less than a year of hard work, five of them have been successfully completed, and the other one is about to be completed. These six reservoirs have a total of 10.34 million cubic meters of earth, stone, and sand, the dam body is 15 li long, and they can store a total of 1.4 billion cubic meters of water, irrigate more than 2.9 million mu of farmland, and can build more than 40 large and small power stations, which can generate more than 22.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity a year. Such large reservoirs with complex projects and requiring a lot of funds and materials cannot be built without people's communes. The total investment in these six reservoirs is 52,068,800 yuan, of which the funds solved by the communes and the masses are 42,478,800 yuan, accounting for 81.5% of the total investment; more than 70% of the important materials necessary for the reservoirs, such as steel, wood, cement, and explosives, are also solved by the communes and the masses. The fact that Linyi Prefecture built six large reservoirs mainly by the masses vividly and powerfully proves that as long as you have ambition, have ambition, go all out, rely on your own efforts, are not afraid of difficulties, and rely on the strength and wisdom of the masses, you can not only build small and medium-sized water conservancy projects, but also in some areas, the people's communes can also host large-scale water conservancy projects.

The facts of Linyi Prefecture are also good teaching materials for some "stretch-out-hand faction" and "difficulties-only" people in water conservancy construction. The "stretch-out-hand faction" relies on the state to solve everything, and stretches out hands to the state for everything, from funds, equipment, and materials to technology. The "difficulties-only" people are intimidated by difficulties, cannot see the favorable conditions brought about by communization, and only emphasize difficulties, believing that to build water conservancy, there must be many steel bars, cement, modern tools, and a large number of technicians. In a word, whether it is the "stretch-out-hand faction" or the "difficulties-only" people, they are looking up instead of looking down, they only see the support of the state, but not the power of the masses, they only see things, but not people; they do not believe that there is infinite wisdom and power hidden in the masses, therefore, they do not rely on the masses, do not mobilize the masses to solve the problems and difficulties in water conservancy construction. After reading the report of Linyi Prefecture, these people should wake up.

The general line is shining brightly, the "three main" policies are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the people's communes are more consolidated, the enthusiasm of the masses is higher... all of these are objectively existing favorable conditions, which are favorable conditions for organizing a new upsurge in water conservancy construction this winter and next spring. In areas where the upsurge has not yet formed, the leaders should actively promote the early arrival of the upsurge; in areas where the upsurge has already arrived, the leaders should go deep into the masses and earnestly lead the water conservancy construction movement. In areas where the upsurge has already arrived, there may also be individual places where actions are slow and work is backward. The leadership must pay attention to the imbalance in the upsurge, carefully study and analyze the reasons for the imbalance, help local cadres come up with solutions, and adopt working methods such as grasping both ends to bring the middle, holding on-site meetings, and organizing visits and comparisons to promote backwardness to catch up with the advanced, so as to eliminate the weak links in the upsurge. In this way, the water conservancy movement this winter and next spring can be fully and deeply developed.

In addition to strengthening leadership and implementing political leadership, doing a good job in labor arrangements is an important link in carrying out the water conservancy construction upsurge. There is a lot of rural work in winter. It is necessary to vigorously develop water conservancy, vigorously accumulate fertilizer, deep plowing, improve soil, requisition and purchase, manage wheat fields, short-distance transportation, and develop rural sideline businesses. These tasks must be properly arranged for labor according to the specific conditions of each region, according to the weight of the tasks, according to the seasons, focusing on the key points and the general, and make good labor plans, divide the battle lines, and divide the responsibilities. Improving labor organization, vigorously carrying out technological reforms, and improving work efficiency, so as to do more with less labor, is also an important task that must be grasped at present. Work such as construction organization, civilian life, and on-site safety and hygiene must also be properly arranged in advance. A comprehensive consideration and reasonable arrangement must also be made for all water conservancy construction projects. At present, we must first give full play to the benefits of the water conservancy projects that have been built in the past. Secondly, we must actively improve the standard of the original water conservancy projects to resist water and drought disasters, and actively host new projects in places where water conservancy problems have not been solved. In those areas with poor water conservancy foundations, small-scale projects must still be vigorously developed; in those areas where small-scale projects have a considerable foundation, necessary medium-sized backbone projects must be added; in areas where backbone projects have been built, we must seize the construction of field ditches and leveling of land to give full play to the benefits of the backbone projects. For the projects built this year, we must combine the construction work to do a good job in winter irrigation and water storage and water conservation. When the reservoir is built, the flood discharge channel must be built at the same time; when the pond and dam are built, the culvert, sluice gate and other irrigation facilities and drainage facilities must be built at the same time, and we must strive for each project to quickly play its benefits after completion.

Now it is November, and winter is coming. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of people in rural areas to build water conservancy is just like early spring. Let us beat the drums of large-scale water conservancy construction, hold high the glorious banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, take immediate action, and join the battle of water conservancy construction to set off a water conservancy construction upsurge that is more majestic, larger in scale, better organized, and of higher quality than in 1958!

### 擂起大兴水利的战鼓

    擂起大兴水利的战鼓
    全国范围的兴修水利运动的序幕已经揭开。10月24日党中央和国务院关于今冬明春继续开展大规模兴修水利和积肥运动的指示下达以后，广大群众的情绪更加振奋，斗志更加昂扬，大搞水利、改造自然的信心和勇气十分高涨。各地普遍修订了今冬明春兴修水利的计划，成立了专门组织，由党委书记亲自挂帅，加强了对水利建设的领导。目前全国已有三千多万劳动大军开赴水利前线。今年水利运动的特点是领导决心大，群众干劲足，一开始就以大跃进的姿态出现。
    毛泽东同志早就指出，“水利是农业的命脉”，党中央和国务院在10月24日的指示中也指出：“水利仍然是目前发展农业生产的根本问题。”水、旱灾害对我国农业生产的威胁，是普遍而严重的。据历史记载，我国自公元前206年到1936年的二千一百四十二年间，共发生过较大水灾一千零三十一次，旱灾一千零六十次，几乎平均每年有一次较大的水灾或旱灾。可以说，几千年来我国农业生产的发展史，就是广大农民和频繁的水、旱灾害作斗争的历史。但是在过去剥削阶级统治时期，这样的斗争不可能发挥它的巨大威力。因此我们祖先经过几千年的漫长岁月和辛勤劳动，到解放前，全国还只有二亿四千万亩灌溉面积。解放后，劳动人民成了国家的主人，千千万万农民在党的领导下向大自然展开了全面的进攻，他们提出了豪迈的口号：“变水害为水利”，“向水要粮食”！在短短十年间，我们治理了千百条大小河流，建起了几十万座大小水库，扩大了灌溉面积到十亿七千万亩。这些水利建设，保证了我国农业连年增产。特别是1957年冬季开始的水利高潮中所修建的水利工程，连续抗御了去年和今年的两次严重的水旱灾害，夺得农业的空前大丰收。今年我国中部地区有十七个省发生了严重的干旱，受旱的范围和干旱的程度都相当甚至超过1928年到1944年之间发生的六次大旱。过去的六次大旱的结果是赤地千里，颗粒无收，妻离子散，家破人亡，仅河南一省在1942年大旱中就死亡三百万人。而今年我们依靠人民公社的强大力量，依靠解放以来特别是大跃进以来兴修的水利工程的威力，战胜了特大的旱灾。受旱最严重的河南、湖北、安徽、江苏等地区仍获得了大丰收。河北和北京地区暴雨成灾，严重的情况超过了1949年。1949年大水灾中，河北淹地四千多万亩；今年由于兴修了水利，受灾面积减少一半，受灾程度也减轻不少。在今年这样的大灾年，我国粮食和棉花的总产量仍能在去年特大跃进的基础上增加10％左右。农田水利建设不只是可以防御水旱灾害的威胁，更重要的是全面贯彻“八字宪法”，结合大量增施肥料、深耕土地、推广优良品种和合理密植等等措施，可以迅速提高单位面积产量和总产量，根据许多典型调查，一般可增产50％左右到一倍，有些地区可增产两三倍左右。例如广西僮族自治区的邕西云江灌区兴修水利以后，产量即由一百万斤增加到五百万斤。
    尽管我们在水利建设上获得了空前的成就，但是我们不能满足这个成就。因为在我国幅员这样广大、自然情况这样复杂的条件下，每年仍然还有几千万亩甚至几亿亩的广大土地，遭受着程度不同的水旱灾害，影响着农业增产的稳定性，威胁着整个国民经济发展和人民的生命安全。要保证农业生产和整个国民经济的继续跃进，就必须大兴水利，使农业生产迅速摆脱水、旱灾害的威胁。因此，党中央和国务院在10月24日发出的关于今冬明春继续开展大规模兴修水利和积肥运动的指示中明确地指出：“在今后几个冬春，再搞几次水利建设高潮，力争在较短时间内实现水利化。这是全党全民建设社会主义的一项重大任务。”具体地来说，就是号召全党全民继续奋战，再组织几次大规模的水利建设高潮，力求在全国范围内基本上控制一般地区的水旱灾害，提前实现农业发展纲要中对水利的要求。
    为了完成上述任务，就要坚持以蓄水为主，以小型为主，以群众自办为主的“三主”方针。用以蓄水为主的精神来治水，不仅可以免除水旱灾害，而且可以综合开发和利用水利资源，变水害为水利，满足各个时期农作物对水的需要。同时还可以发展发电、航运和水产等事业。小型工程是花钱少、收效快的工程，是培养水源和保护大、中型工程的基础。但是，有了小型还必须要有必要的大、中型工程，才能控制大、中河流的洪水。大、中、小型相结合，才能构成地上水和地下水互相为用的完整水利工程系统，才能最有效和最大限度地发挥水利工程的效益，也才有可能抵抗较大的旱涝灾害，保证农业生产稳定增产。兴修水利除了以小型为主、以蓄水为主以外，还必须以群众自办为主。因为水利建设的范围广、数量大，必须充分发动群众、依靠群众，才能解决人力、物力、经费、技术等等问题。
    应该认识：“三主”方针，是党在水利建设中大搞群众运动经验的总结，是在水利建设方面贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的具体方针。湖南常宁县在前八年只修了六十座小型水库和一座中型水库，贯彻“三主”方针以后，1958年就修建了七百多座水库。广西来宾县过去修水利一亩地大约要花二十多元，1958年平均不到一元。从全国范围来说，贯彻了“三主”的方针，两年来共修建了大型水库四十九座，为解放以后八年中所修大型水库的四倍半；中型水库一千四百七十座，为前八年的四倍多；受益面积达万亩以上的大型灌区三千处，为前八年的两倍以上；共作土石方七百多亿立方米，为前八年的七倍以上；扩大灌溉面积五亿五千万亩，为前八年的两倍多；初步治理洼涝面积二亿一千万亩，初步控制水土流失面积四十万平方公里，发展机械排灌二百四十万马力。这些事实，无可辩驳地证明了“三主”方针的正确。在今后的水利建设中，随着生产发展的需要，水利运动当然将向更高阶段发展，水利建设的规模从小到大，组织从分散到统一，标准从低级到高级。这是水利建设发展的趋势。但是，“三主”的方针仍然要贯彻到底。
    贯彻执行“三主”方针，现在有了特别有利的条件，这就是人民公社更加巩固了。人民公社在水利建设中发挥了巨大的威力，正如党中央和国务院在10月24日所指出的：“人民公社是水利运动的新基础，给水利运动带来很多新的特点：它便于举办较大的骨干工程，使大中小型水利工程结合起来；它便于把过去分散的孤立的工程联结起来，形成一个比较完整的灌溉排水系统；它便于结合大江大河的治理，进行中小河流全流域的规划和综合开发；它便于在互助互利和等价交换的原则下，统一调配劳力，组织大协作和大兵团作战；它便于统一调配水源，推行计划用水，加强灌溉管理，实现园田化等等。”人民公社不但可以大量兴建小型工程，而且可以在群众自办为主、国家支援为辅的方针下兴办中型甚至大型工程。以中型工程来说，公社化以前的九年期间，全国一共修建了七百一十七座，蓄水一百零三亿立方米；公社化后一年间，就修建了一千零七十八座，蓄水二百零八亿立方米，蓄水量为公社化前的两倍。以群众自办为主修建大型工程，过去简直不敢想像，但是，公社化后也成为现实了。昨日本报第四版报道的：山东临沂专区一年来修建了六个蓄水二亿立方米以上的大型水库，就是一个最突出的例子。临沂专区的许家崖、日照、唐村和会宝岭等六个大水库，是1958年秋天在突击秋收、秋种和大办钢铁的同时，开始动工修建的。经过不到一年的艰苦奋战，有五处已经胜利竣工，另一处也即将完成。这六个水库共做了土石沙方一千零三十四万立方米，坝身共长十五华里，一共可以蓄水十四亿立方米，灌溉农田二百九十多万亩，能建大小发电站四十多处，一年可以发电二千二百七十多万度。像这样工程复杂、需要大量资金和物料的大水库，没有人民公社是办不到的。这六个水库共投资五千二百零六万八千元，其中依靠公社和群众解决的资金是四千二百四十七万八千元，占投资总数的81.5％；水库上所必需的重要器材，如钢材、木材、水泥、炸药等，70％以上也是依靠公社和群众解决的。临沂专区以群众自办为主兴建六个大水库的事实，生动有力地证明：只要有志气，有雄心，鼓足干劲，自力更生，不怕困难，依靠群众的力量和智慧，不但可以办小型、中型水利工程，而且在有些地区，人民公社还可以举办大型水利工程。
    临沂专区的事实，对于水利建设上的一些“伸手派”和“困难论”者，也是很好的教材。“伸手派”事事都要依赖国家解决，资金、器材、物资，以至技术样样都伸手向国家要。“困难论”者则是被困难吓倒，看不到公社化以后带来的有利条件，只是一味强调困难，认为要修水利就得有许多钢筋、水泥、现代化工具和大批技术人员。一句话，不管是“伸手派”或“困难论”者，他们都是眼睛向上而不是眼睛向下，只看到国家的支援，看不到群众的力量，只看到物，看不到人；他们不相信群众中蕴藏着无穷的智慧和力量，因此，他们不依靠群众、不发动群众解决兴修水利中的问题和困难。读了临沂专区的报道，这些人应当清醒过来了。
    总路线光芒万丈，“三主”方针深入人心，人民公社更加巩固，群众情绪更加高涨……，这一切都是客观存在的有利条件，是组织今冬明春的水利建设新高潮的有利条件。在高潮尚未形成的地区，领导者要积极地促进高潮的早日到来；在高潮已经到来的地区，领导者就要深入群众，切实地领导水利建设运动。在高潮已经到来的地区，也可能有个别的地方行动迟缓，工作落后。领导上必须注意高潮中的不平衡现象，认真研究分析发生不平衡的原因，帮助当地干部想出解决的办法，并且采取抓两头带中间、开现场会、组织参观评比等工作方法，促使落后赶上先进，以消除高潮中的薄弱环节。这样，今冬明春的水利运动，才能全面地深入地展开。
    除了加强领导，实行政治挂帅以外，做好劳力安排是开展水利建设高潮的重要环节。冬季农村工作很多，既要大搞水利，还要大搞积肥，还有深翻、改良土壤、征购、麦田管理、短途运输和开展农村副业等等，这些工作都必须根据各个地区的具体条件来妥善安排劳力，按任务轻重，按季节先后，分别重点和一般，做好劳力计划，划分战线，分工负责。改进劳动组织，大搞技术改革，提高工效，以较少的劳动力，办更多的事，也是当前必须抓紧的一项重要工作。对施工组织、民工生活、工地安全卫生等工作，也要事先妥善安排。对各项水利建设工程，也要做到全面照顾和合理安排。目前，首先要使过去已修的水利工程，充分发挥效益。其次，要积极提高原有水利工程抗御水旱灾害的标准，并且在没有解决水利问题的地方，积极举办新的工程。在那些水利基础较差的地区，仍然要大办小型工程；在那些小型工程已经具有相当基础的地方，要增修必要的中型骨干工程；在已建骨干工程的地区，要抓紧修建田间沟渠和平整土地，使骨干工程充分发挥效益。对于今年兴修的工程；要结合修建工作，做好冬灌和蓄水、保水工作。修好水库，就要同时修好溢洪道；修好塘坝，就要同时修好涵管、水闸等灌溉设施和排水设施，力争每项工程建成以后就能很快地发挥效益。
    现在是11月了，冬季就要到来。农村中广大人民群众兴修水利的热情却恰如初春。让我们擂起大兴水利的战鼓，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光荣旗帜，立即行动起来，投入水利建设的战斗中，掀起一个比1958年气势更磅礴，规模更大，组织更健全，质量更高的兴修水利高潮吧！
