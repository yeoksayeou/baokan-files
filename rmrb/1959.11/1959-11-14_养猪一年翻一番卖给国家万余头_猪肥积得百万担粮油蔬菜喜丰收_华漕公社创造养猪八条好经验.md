Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 13th. The Huacao People's Commune in Shanghai County, Shanghai City, has already achieved 1.27 pigs per mu of land. By the end of September, the commune's livestock farm and various production teams collectively raised 30,857 pigs (excluding privately raised ones), more than doubling the number when the commune was established in October last year.

Huacao Commune's vigorous development of pig raising has greatly promoted agricultural production. In the past year, the entire commune accumulated a total of one million dan of pig manure. Considering that one dan of pig manure is equivalent to one jin of chemical fertilizer, this is like building a chemical fertilizer factory with an annual output of one million jin in Huacao Commune. This year, the pig manure applied to the commune's main crops such as rice, rapeseed, and vegetables increased by an average of 20% compared to last year. Due to the increase in fertilizer, summer crops achieved an overall bumper harvest this year. The average yield of rapeseed per mu was 203 jin, an increase of 131% over last year; the average yield of wheat per mu was 271 jin, an increase of 69.5% over last year; and the market supply of vegetables in the first half of the year increased by 25% compared to last year. Due to the increase in pig manure, the amount of commercial fertilizer decreased, and agricultural costs were correspondingly reduced. From January to September this year, agricultural production costs decreased by 6.9% compared to the same period last year, of which commercial fertilizer expenditures decreased by 30%. Pig manure is an organic fertilizer that effectively improves the soil. Originally, 70% of the cultivated land in the Red Star Production Team was "dry ditch mud" (medium clay) and "rusty dry ditch mud" (heavy clay). After a large amount of pig manure was applied in the past two years, most of it has been improved into fertile yellow soil.

The development of animal husbandry has greatly increased the income of the commune, production teams, and commune members. From January to September this year, the total agricultural income of the entire commune was 1,558,932 yuan, an increase of 19.96% compared to the same period last year; while the animal husbandry income was 546,435 yuan, an increase of 57.34% compared to the same period last year. The proportion of animal husbandry income in the commune's total agricultural income has increased from 21% in the same period last year to 26%.

The great development of pig raising has also provided more meat food for urban residents. From September last year to September this year, the commune sold 9,642 fattened pigs and 3,952 piglets to the state. On average, each household sold 3.13 fattened pigs and 1.2 piglets. This is impossible to achieve by relying solely on private raising.

The great development of pig raising in Huacao Commune is the result of leveraging the superiority of the people's commune – its large size and high degree of public ownership – implementing the simultaneous promotion of both public and private raising, vigorously developing collective pig raising, and relying on self-reliance and using "poor methods" to raise pigs. After the establishment of the commune, it put forward the slogan of "doubling the number of pigs," mobilized the masses, and first concentrated its efforts on solving the three key problems in pig raising: piglets, feed, and pigsties. Lacking piglets, they adopted the method of "keeping every female pig and selecting later," retaining many sows and breeding a large number of piglets. As a result, they not only met the needs of the commune's more than 20,000 piglets but also supported other surrounding communes. The commune also established a breeding farm and cultivated improved breeds. Solving the feed problem is the central issue in determining whether or not pig raising can be greatly developed. In the past, pig raising in the Huacao area mainly relied on the city's supply of feed, and most of the pigs' food was rice bran, bean cake, and bean meal. After communization, although the total amount of refined feed supplied by the city did not decrease, there were more pigs, so the refined feed was not enough. The commune adopted the methods of vigorously developing feed bases, planting aquatic crops on a large scale, and making full use of agricultural and sideline products and urban scraps, breaking the past "refined feed as the mainstay" feeding method. All water surfaces and riverbanks were densely planted with water hyacinth, water spinach, and wild peanuts, and so on. With sufficient green fodder, the amount of refined feed could be greatly reduced. Refined feed was reduced from 80% of pig feed in the past to about 10%, ensuring the rapid development of pig raising in a short period of time. At the same time, the cost of pig raising was also greatly reduced. In the past, a pig ate 2.5 jiao worth of feed a day, but now it only costs 6 or 7 fen. If there were too few pigsties, they would use waste materials to rebuild pig sheds and expand the breeding capacity.

After overcoming the three obstacles of piglets, feed, and pigsties, whether or not they were well managed became the key to whether or not pig raising could be developed on a large scale. Over the past year, the Huacao People's Commune has explored a set of relatively advanced pig raising methods. In terms of feeding management, sows, weaned pigs, fattened pigs, and boars were classified, penned separately, and assigned to dedicated personnel. This enabled the breeders to explore the characteristics of various pigs and each pen of pigs, each pig, what food to feed, and how much to feed; and to master the laws of old sows mating one and a half days after estrus, producing after one hundred and fifteen days, and gradually increasing refined feed during the sow's pregnancy. Generally, the food was washed clean, cut fine, cooked thoroughly, and fed adequately; the pigsties were kept free of wind and rain, hard pens were flushed every day, and soft pens were kept dry. This ensured that the pigs ate well, lived well, and grew fast. In terms of epidemic prevention and hygiene, each production team had a veterinarian, and each small team had an epidemic prevention worker (also serving as a breeder). Preventive injections were given monthly according to the different types of pigs, basically achieving no swine fever, no erysipelas, no asthma, no white dysentery, and no paratyphoid fever. Accidents caused by disease and death were basically eliminated, ensuring the healthy growth of pigs.

After the great development of pig raising, the number of breeders would have to be increased accordingly. Therefore, reforming tools to solve the problem of labor shortage became an urgent matter. The Nanchen Lane small team of the Houjiajiao Production Team raised more than 400 pigs, so one breeder had to specialize in fetching water, carrying 100 dan a day, which was very heavy work. The small team leader, Han Fuxiang, discussed the matter with the breeders and the transferred cadres, collected old materials from various sources, and spent very little money to trial-produce a foot-operated water pump in March of this year, pumping river water into an earthen water storage tower, and then using pipes to connect to the feed room and pigsties. By pedaling for one hour, they could use it for a whole day. This greatly improved labor efficiency and reduced the labor intensity of the breeders. They also built a wooden track from the feed room to the pigsties, and the pig feed was transported on the track using carts, with one cart able to carry the amount of feed that three people could carry. Later, they also bought a feed shredder. The commune held an on-site meeting in this production team and vigorously promoted this practice. Now, many production teams are vigorously carrying out technical innovations. They are required to have each breeder raise 100 pigs next year.

The most important aspect of raising piglets well is whether the breeders raise them well. After the establishment of the commune, Party organizations at all levels selected outstanding personnel to strengthen the ranks of breeders. These breeders from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds were full of enthusiasm and actively studied their work. In just a few months, they not only learned how to match feed and manage pens separately, but also how to repair pig sheds and give preventive injections. The masses called them all-rounders. They took great care of the pigs. For example, Zhou Jinying, the breeder of Liujiaqiao, stayed up all night in the pig shed during the sow's production period. When the sow could not give birth to the piglets, she used her hands to pull the piglets out of the sow's belly one by one. One day, she went to work outside the pig shed, and suddenly a piglet screamed. As soon as she heard it, she knew that the piglet was being crushed by the sow, so she rushed into the pig shed, rescued the piglet from under the sow's body, held it in her arms, and kept stroking it, as if caring for an injured child. At this time, comrades from other communes happened to come to visit this pig shed, and they were very moved when they saw it. They all said, "With such good breeders, pigs must be raised well."

The great development of pig raising in Huacao Commune over the past year is ultimately the result of implementing political command and strengthening Party leadership. Due to the promotion and leadership of the Party, pig raising began to develop in the Huacao Commune area during the period of cooperation. When the people's commune was established, it had already reached an average of four pigs per household. After the establishment of the commune, it was proposed to double the number of pigs in order to develop agricultural production and support urban non-staple foods. However, this slogan was resisted by capitalist ideology represented by a small number of wealthy middle peasants. In the view of these people, if there was too little refined feed, pig raising could not be greatly developed. Some wealthy middle peasants even opposed planting feed and advocated planting more vegetables to earn cash, shouting that pig raising was losing money and not worthwhile. The Commune Party Committee promptly pointed out that this was a struggle between more, faster, better, and more economical versus less, slower, worse, and more expensive. It also conducted education among cadres and the masses, repeatedly explaining the great significance of vigorously developing pig raising to the development of agricultural production, supporting cities, increasing the income of commune members, and consolidating the people's commune. While grasping ideology, the Commune Party Committee strengthened organizational leadership. The commune established a livestock department to uniformly plan and lead the livestock business of the entire commune. From the production team to the production small team, a deputy captain of sideline production was assigned to manage livestock production. Based on the practice of pig raising over the past year, the commune has recently summarized a set of pig raising experiences, which can be summarized into eight characters: breed (improved breed), seedlings (piglets), sheds (pigsties), feed (feed), management (management), prevention (epidemic prevention and hygiene), tools (tool reform), and specialization (professional leadership). The commune members call these eight experiences the "eight treasures" of pig raising.

Huacao Commune has formulated a plan for a great leap forward in animal husbandry in 1960. In terms of pig raising, it guarantees the completion of 60,000 heads and strives to reach 70,000 heads; an average of 2.5 pigs per mu of land and an average of four pigs per person.

    据新华社上海13日电　上海市上海县华漕人民公社已经实现了一亩地一点二七头猪。到9月底，公社畜牧场和各生产队已经集体养猪三万零八百五十七头（不包括私养数），比去年10月公社成立时翻一番还多。
    华漕公社大力发展养猪事业，对农业生产起了巨大的促进作用。一年来，全社共积猪粪一百万担。以一担猪粪相当于一斤化肥计算，这就如同在华漕公社新建了一座年产一百万斤的化肥厂。今年这个公社的水稻、油菜、蔬菜等主要作物施的猪粪平均比去年增加20％。由于肥料增加，今年夏季作物获得全面丰收。油菜平均亩产二百零三斤，比去年增长131％，小麦平均亩产二百七十一斤，比去年增长69.5％，上半年蔬菜上市量比去年增加25％。由于猪粪增加，商品肥料减少，农业成本也相应降低了。今年1月至9月，农业生产费用比去年同期降低6.9％，其中商品性肥料支出降低了30％。猪粪是一种有机肥料，有效地改良了土壤。红星生产队原来70％的耕地是“干沟泥”（中粘土）和“铁锈干沟泥”（重粘土）。经过这两年来大量施用猪肥，绝大部分已改良为肥沃的黄泥土。
    畜牧业的发展，大大增加了公社、生产队和社员的收入。今年1月到9月，全社农业收入为一百五十五万八千九百三十二元，比去年同期增加19.96％；而畜牧业收入为五十四万六千四百三十五元，比去年同期增加57.34％。畜牧业收入在公社农业总收入中所占比重已由去年同期的21％增加到26％。
    养猪事业大发展，也为城市居民提供了更多的肉食品。从去年9月到今年9月，公社卖给国家肉猪九千六百四十二头，猪苗三千九百五十二头。平均每户出售肉猪三点一三头，猪苗一点二头。这是单靠私养所不可能办到的。
    华漕公社养猪事业大发展，是发挥人民公社一大二公的优越性，贯彻公养私养同时并举，大搞集体养猪，自力更生用“穷办法”养猪的结果。公社成立后，就提出“生猪翻一番”的口号，发动群众，首先集中力量解决了猪苗、饲料、猪舍等养猪的三大关键问题。缺少猪苗，便采取“见雌必留，先留后选”的办法，留下了许多母猪，大量繁殖猪苗。结果不但满足了公社两万多头猪苗的需要，而且还支援了周围其他公社。公社并建立了种畜场，培育了良种。解决饲料是决定能不能大养猪的中心问题。过去华漕一带养猪主要是依靠城市供给饲料，猪的食料绝大部分是米糠、豆饼和豆粞。公社化之后，城市供应的精饲料总数虽然没有减少，但是猪多了，精饲料便不够了。公社采取大搞饲料基地、大种水生作物、充分利用农副产品和市区下脚的办法，破除了过去“以精为主”的饲养办法。利用所有水面、河岸，密密层层地种上水浮莲、水葫芦和野花生等等。有了充分的青饲料，精饲料便可以大大减少。精饲料由过去占猪饲料的80％减少到10％左右，保证了短时期内养猪迅速发展。同时养猪的成本也大大降低，过去一头猪一天要吃二角五分钱饲料，现在只花六、七分钱便可以了。猪舍太少，就利用废旧料，改建猪棚，扩大饲养量。
    闯过了猪苗、饲料、猪棚三关之后，管得好不好便成为能不能大量发展养猪的关键。一年来，华漕人民公社已摸索出一套比较先进的养猪方法。在饲养管理方面，对母猪、隔奶猪、肉猪、公猪做到了分类分棚，分工专人负责。这样就使饲养员能够摸索出各种猪和每一棚猪、每一头猪的特性，需要喂些什么食料、用食量多少；掌握好老母猪发情一天半后交配、一百一十五天生产、母猪怀孕期间精饲料逐渐增加等等方面的规律。食料一般都能做到洗得净、切得细、煮得熟、喂得足；猪舍做到不漏风漏雨，硬棚天天冲，软棚保干燥。保证了猪吃好、住好、长肉快。在防疫卫生方面，每个生产队有兽医，每个小队有防疫员（饲养员兼的）。按照不同类型的猪，月月打预防针，基本上做到了无猪瘟、无丹毒、无气喘、无白痢、无副伤寒。基本上消灭了因病死亡事故，保证了生猪健康成长。
    养猪事业大发展后，饲养员就要相应地增加，因此，改革工具解决人手不足就成为刻不容缓的事情了。侯家角生产队南陈巷小队养了四百多只猪，就要一个饲养员专门挑水，一天挑一百担，活很重。小队长韩富祥就和饲养员、下放干部一起商量，从各方面搜集旧料，花了很少的钱，在今年3月试制了一部脚踏式抽水车，把河水抽到土制的贮水塔，再用管子通到饲料间和猪舍里。只要踏一小时车，便可以用上一天。这样就大大的提高劳动效率，减轻了饲养员的劳动强度。他们又从饲料间到猪舍建造了一条木轨道，猪饲料使用车子从轨道上运过去，一车能推三个人挑的饲料。后来，他们又买了一部饲料切碎机。公社就在这个生产队召开现场会议，大力推广这种做法。现在许多生产队都在大闹技术革新。要求明年做到每个饲养员养猪一百头。
    猪仔养得好不好，最重要的一环是在于饲养员饲养得好不好。公社成立后，各级党组织都挑选了优秀人员充实了饲养员的队伍。这些贫、下中农出身的饲养员，干劲十足，积极钻研工作，没有几个月不但会饲料搭配、分棚管理，而且还会修理猪棚、打防疫针。群众称他们为全能手。他们对猪爱护备至，如刘家桥饲养员周金英在母猪生产期间，就在猪棚里通宵看护。当母猪生不出小猪时，她就用手从母猪肚子里把小猪一只一只地摸出来。一天，她去猪棚外面工作，忽然一只小猪尖叫，她一听便知道小猪被母猪压住了，就冲到猪棚里去，把小猪从母猪身体下面救了出来，放在怀里，不断地抚摸着它，好像爱护受伤的小孩一样。这时，恰巧遇到其他公社的同志来参观这个猪棚，看了十分感动，都说：“有这样好的饲养员，猪一定养得好。”
    华漕公社一年来养猪事业所以能够获得大发展归根结底是实行政治挂帅，加强党的领导的结果。华漕公社这一带在合作化时期，由于党的提倡和领导，开始发展养猪。人民公社成立时，已达到平均每户四头。公社成立后，提出为了发展农业生产和支援城市副食品，生猪翻一番。但是这个口号遭到了以少数富裕中农为代表的资本主义思想的抵抗，在这些人看来，精饲料太少，就不能大养猪。某些富裕中农更反对种植饲料，主张多种蔬菜多赚现钱，大叫养猪亏本不合算。公社党委及时指出这是多快好省与少慢差费的斗争。并在干部和群众中进行教育，反复说明大办养猪事业，对发展农业生产、支援城市、增加社员收入和巩固人民公社的重大意义。公社党委在抓思想的同时，加强了组织领导。公社成立了畜牧部，统一规划和领导全公社的畜牧事业，从生产队到生产小队都配备了副业队长一人专管畜牧生产。根据一年来养猪的实践，最近公社已总结出一套养猪经验，归纳起来是八个字：种（良种）、苗（猪苗）、舍（猪舍）、料（饲料）、管（管理）、防（防疫卫生）、工（工具改革）和专（专业领导），社员们称这八条经验是养猪的“八宝”。
    华漕公社已订出1960年的畜牧业大跃进的规划，在养猪方面，保证完成六万头，力争达到七万头；平均每亩地二头半猪，平均每人四头猪。
