Our county had a bumper harvest this year, at least 30% more than last year's Great Leap Forward. In addition to being happy, people often say, "Bad year, good harvest!" This is a very brilliant statement that reflects the wisdom and pride of the speaker. Indeed, our county's bumper harvest was achieved in a "bad year" with 300 days without a thorough rain.
Speaking of famine, it is not uncommon in our county. Floods or droughts, although not every year, always occur every two or three years. But "bad year, good harvest" is the first time it has appeared. It is unprecedented to be able to irrigate both the summer and autumn crops with well water. It shows that through the mass movement of large-scale water conservancy, we have begun to enter the stage of "double insurance against drought and flood."
"Bad year, good harvest" often reminds people of the drought resistance production this year. Strangely enough, although we encountered a major drought this year, the masses did not panic and become disoriented as in previous years when natural disasters occurred, nor did they worry about the harvest with frowns as usual. Because of the groups of mechanized wells, people were not afraid of drought. With the people's commune as a strong backing, people were not afraid of being isolated and weak. With the leadership of the Party, people were not afraid of losing their way. This year's drought resistance was carried out with great enthusiasm, strict organization, and intense labor. When the drought was severe, we fought hard day and night, but people have always been confident, acted rhythmically, and felt comfortable and happy. The efforts people put in this year are actually much more than in previous years, but they feel more relaxed than in previous years. This indeed shows that due to the foundation laid by the Great Leap Forward and the superiority of the people's communes, coupled with the strong leadership of the Party, people's ability to fight natural disasters has been greatly enhanced, and their confidence has been greatly improved. In comparison, they feel more calm than in previous years. The scale of mass mobilization this year is deeper and wider than in previous years, but the resistance and difficulties encountered are less than in any other year. This also shows that the mass movement to build socialism has developed to a new stage.
Because the broad masses of people are closely united under the leadership of the Party and in the organization of the people's communes, and resolutely move forward, enthusiastically fighting against the drought, the resistance and difficulties have been successfully overcome. The story of a model young couple who are stoker machine operators in our county can illustrate this situation.
In a machine well room in a village, there were originally two stoker machine operators. One was the son of a well-to-do middle peasant. When the drought was severe and wheat urgently needed irrigation, this person abandoned the stoker machine and went elsewhere to find "good work." It was difficult to find another person who knew how to operate the machine for a while, but another young poor peasant did not waver or feel discouraged. He asked the Party organization to move his young wife into the machine room, so that he could teach her while helping her work. They worked in shifts day and night for three whole months. The wheat in the whole county achieved a large-scale bumper harvest due to the efforts of countless such strong people.
The bumper harvest in the drought once again proves the correctness of the Party's general line and the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes. The revolutionary people rely on the leadership of the Party, and the Party relies closely on the strong people. This is a revolutionary whole that is constantly moving forward, an invincible force!

    年成不好收成好
    高仰山
    我们县里今年大丰收了。比大跃进的去年，至少又多收三成。人们在高兴之余，总爱说这么一句话：“年成不好收成好！”这是一句非常精采的话，它反映着答话人的智慧和自豪。的确，我们县的丰收是在三百天不下透雨的“年成不好”的情况下得到的。
    提起灾荒，在我们县来说，并不是什么奇怪事。或涝或旱，虽不是年年有，但当中总隔不了两三年。但是“年成不好收成好”，却是第一次出现。靠井水能够浇熟夏又浇熟了秋，这是自古以来还没有过的事。它表明，经过大搞水利的群众运动，我们这里已经开始步入了“旱涝双保险”的阶段。
    “年成不好收成好”，这句话常常引起人们对今年抗旱生产的回顾，说来也奇怪，今年虽是遇到大旱，但是在群众这一方面，并没有像往年遇到天灾时那样的心慌意乱过，没有像往常那样愁眉不展地担心过收成。由于有了成群的机井，人们就不怕天旱，有了人民公社这个铁打的靠山，人们就不怕人单力薄，有了党在领导，人们就不怕迷失方向。今年的抗旱，人们的干劲很大，组织很严密，劳动也很紧张，旱灾严重时，也曾日日夜夜的苦战过，可是，人们却一直是心中有数，行动很有节奏，心情很舒畅、愉快。今年人们出的力气实际上比往年多的多，但却觉得比往年省劲。这的确说明着，由于大跃进打下的基础和人民公社的优越性，加上党的有力领导，使人们对于自然灾害的斗争能力大大增强了，信心大大提高了，相对之下，便觉得比往年反而从容些了。今年群众发动的规模比往年又深又广，但所遇到的阻力和困难却比任何一年都少。这也说明着，建设社会主义的群众运动，发展到了一个新的阶段。
    由于广大人民紧紧地团结在党的领导下，在人民公社的组织下，坚定向前，热情奔放地同旱灾展开了斗争，阻力和困难也就被顺利打破了。我们县流传着一对模范青年锅驼机手的佳话，是可以说明这种情况的。
    在某村一个机井房里，原来有两个锅驼机手。一个是富裕中农的子弟。正当旱灾严重，小麦急需浇灌的时候，这个人甩下锅驼机，到别处去找“好活”干去了。一时难再找到一个会开机器的人来，但是另一个贫雇农青年，并没有动摇和泄气，他向党组织要求，把自己年青的妻子搬进机器房来，由他一面教她，一面帮助工作。他们夫妻日夜轮班，整整坚持了三个月。全县的麦子，就是在无数个这样的坚强的人的奋斗下，获得了大面积丰收的。
    旱灾中的丰收，再一次证实了党的总路线的正确，人民公社的无比优越。革命的人民依靠着党的领导，党又紧紧依靠着坚强的人民。这是一个不断前进的革命整体，是无往不胜的力量！
