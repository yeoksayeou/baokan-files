The mass movement for water conservancy construction launched by agricultural workers in Romania after the autumn harvest has achieved remarkable results.

So far, thanks to the high morale and hard work of farmers in various regions, the newly added irrigated area has reached 86,000 hectares, exceeding the target of 78,000 hectares for expanding the irrigated area this year proposed by the Council of Ministers. The projects under intense construction or in preparation for construction in various places cover a total irrigated area of 34,000 hectares. When these water conservancy projects are completed, the country's irrigated area will more than double compared to the end of last year.

In terms of flood control and drainage, Romania plans to build dikes and drain water on 290,000 hectares of land this year. Currently, this work has been completed on 95,000 hectares of land and is underway on another 290,000 hectares. Therefore, the dike construction and drainage projects built this year will far exceed the state plan. In the past, Romania lacked small reservoirs for irrigating farmland, but in this year's mass movement for water conservancy construction, 28 small reservoirs have already emerged, and another 120 are under construction.

More than half of the water conservancy projects built this year were completed through voluntary labor by the masses. Agricultural workers in various regions have shown great enthusiasm for these tasks, and work at some construction sites has not even stopped at night. The masses in various places have also demonstrated a spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation in the movement. So far, they have contributed approximately eight million workdays and excavated more than 18 million cubic meters of earth. The Romanian Party and government attach great importance to and care for the water conservancy construction movement. In the movement, agricultural water conservancy committees have been established in various states. This year, the state has also sent a large number of technical cadres to rural areas to assist in the work.

Romania will undertake water conservancy construction on an even larger scale and in a more planned manner in the future. Next year, Romania plans to expand the irrigated area by approximately 200,000 hectares, and by 1965, the country's irrigated area will reach 1.5 million hectares, which is a fourteen-fold increase compared to the irrigated area in 1958.

    兴修水利的群众运动取得显著成绩
    罗马尼亚灌溉面积增加近一倍
    新华社布加勒斯特16日电　罗马尼亚农业劳动者在秋收后掀起的兴修水利的群众性运动，已经取得了显著的成果。
    到目前为止，由于各地农民斗志昂扬，发挥了干劲，新增加的灌溉面积已经达到八万六千公顷，超额完成了部长会议提出的今年扩大灌溉面积七万八千公顷的任务。正在各地紧张施工或进行施工准备工作的工程的灌溉面积共为三万四千公顷，当这些水利建设完成时，全国灌溉面积将比去年底增加一倍多。
    在防洪和排涝方面，今年，罗马尼亚计划在二十九万公顷土地上筑堤和排涝。现在，这项工作已经在九万五千公顷土地上完成，并且还在二十九万公顷土地上进行。因此，今年兴建的筑堤、排涝工程也将远远超过国家计划。罗马尼亚过去没有灌溉农田的小型水库，但在今年兴修水利的群众运动中，已经出现了二十八个小水库，另外还有一百二十个正在修建中。
    在今年兴修的水利工程中，有半数以上是通过群众义务劳动来完成的。各地农业劳动者对这些工作表现了很大积极性，有些工地的工作甚至在夜间也没有中断过。各地群众在运动中还发挥了互助协作的精神。现在，他们已经作了约八百万个劳动日，挖了一千八百多万土方。罗马尼亚党和政府十分重视与关怀兴修水利的运动。在运动中，各州都成立了农田水利委员会，今年，国家还派了大批技术干部到农村协助工作。
    罗马尼亚今后将更大规模地和更有计划地兴修水利。明年，罗马尼亚计划扩大灌溉面积约二十万公顷，而到1965年，全国灌溉面积将达到一百五十万公顷，即将比1958年的灌溉面积增加十四倍。
