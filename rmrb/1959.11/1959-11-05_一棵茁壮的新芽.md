    A Robust Sapling
    Shen Qing
    Like other people's communes, the Fengshan People's Commune in Liucheng County, Guangxi, has leveraged the great superiority of being "large in scale and highly collectivized" from its inception, establishing and developing a number of commune-run enterprises. These commune-run enterprises and undertakings, along with the public accumulation funds and public welfare funds controlled and used by the commune, are still only a bud, but they are new things with vigorous youthful vitality.
    
    A Newly Opened Road
    From the moment they appeared, the commune-run enterprises of the Fengshan Commune brought benefits to the commune members.
    
    This story begins with the establishment of the commune's orchard.
    
    In the Fengshan area, the old county was famous for its pears, making life relatively prosperous. Before communization, many advanced cooperatives nearby wanted to plant more fruit trees as well. However, as the members said at the time, "An orchard is a treasure mountain, easy to ascend but hard to break through the 'three barriers'." The first was that the advanced cooperatives had limited accumulated funds and no money to buy fruit seedlings; the second was a lack of technical personnel to plant orchards; and the third was limited labor.
    
    Last autumn, the commune was established. The members repeatedly requested the commune to establish a nursery. The commune's "large organizational scale and wide range of activities" allowed the framework of the orchard to be set up quickly: fourteen li of barren hills were demarcated from near the Nandan Brigade, eighty-four young men and women were transferred from ten brigades, the old orchardist Xie Futian was brought in from the old county, and Party Branch Secretary Wen Jinlin was appointed director, with an initial operating fund of 600 yuan. However, many difficulties remained. The weeds on the barren hills were taller than people, and tigers appeared frequently; there were no fruit seedlings, and not enough money to buy them. The commune Party committee and members were not intimidated by the difficulties. They carefully planned and studied ways to overcome them. The members of each production brigade were also very enthusiastic, saying, "What difficulties can't such a large commune overcome? 'Everyone grabbing a handful of soil can suffocate a river.'" They also said, "The commune has little money now, so we'll cover the young people's food expenses for a month." Since the orchard lacked livestock and tools, each brigade sent a plow and a set of farming tools. The young people who were transferred to work in the orchard were even more enthusiastic. There were many weeds on the hills, so they cut hundreds of bundles and sold them, increasing the operating funds; in one go, they cleared several hundred mu of wasteland, burned thousands of bundles of grass and wood ash, and scared away the tigers. They also planted dozens of mu of vegetables, selling them for several thousand yuan, which was more than enough for operating funds. Thirty young people traveled all over the barren mountains and wild ridges of the nearby three counties, collecting more than two million wild pear seedlings. They bought and collected some fruit tree branches from the production brigades, and using the "single-bud grafting method," planted more than two million fruit seedlings; together with those planted by direct seeding and grafting, there were a total of 6,463,000 seedlings. The young commune members worked hard from dawn till dusk. By this spring, some of the fruit seedlings were ready to be transplanted, and in addition to transplanting 6,600 seedlings in the orchard itself and supplying 45,500 seedlings to the commune's brigades, they also sold 59,900 seedlings to other areas. It is estimated that 1.87 million seedlings will be ready for transplanting this winter and next spring. In less than a year, this orchard, which was started with only 600 yuan in cash, turned over 17,350 yuan in profits to the commune, and purchased various tools and simple machinery worth 6,621 yuan, as well as several hundred technical reference books.
    
    During this period, the commune Party committee gradually clarified the principle that while developing commune-run enterprises also requires the support of the state, the main way is to rely on the ambition and hard work of the masses.
    
    Over the past year, the entire commune has established twelve commune-run enterprises, including: orchards, fish farms, farm tool factories, saltpeter factories, fertilizer factories, pesticide factories, bamboo ware factories, clothing factories, paper mills, grain processing factories, building materials factories, and duck hatcheries. Because these enterprises were established by relying on the diligence and thrift of the masses, the investment was small and the profits were large. The total investment in infrastructure and production for the twelve enterprises was only 36,539 yuan, while the total value of the assets has now grown to 248,107 yuan, an increase of nearly sixfold. These constantly increasing enterprise profits have provided a large amount of accumulation for the commune. From January to August 1959, the commune's accumulation increased by 101,727 yuan. At present, the total value of the funds of the commune's enterprises and undertakings, plus the public accumulation funds and public welfare funds controlled and used by the commune, is already equivalent to 21% of the total income of the ten production brigades in the first year of the commune's establishment. What an exciting thing this is!
    
    A Backing for Production
    The first major contribution of commune-run enterprises in the Fengshan Commune was to promote the "prosperity of all industries" in the collective economy of each production brigade. The members' comment was: With the commune having a foundation, the brigades' production has a backing.
    
    All this is reflected in three major events.
    
    The first was the construction of the Xiaoshan Reservoir with investment from the commune's accumulation. In the past, the masses in the Fengshan area said, "We can't stand drought, and we can't stand rain, it's really like a shoulder pole without nails, worrying about both ends." After liberation, cooperativization was realized, and the masses built some small-scale water conservancy projects within a single cooperative, giving them a sigh of relief; but it was still not enough in the event of a major drought. There was a mountain depression called "Xiaoshan," and building a dam to form a reservoir could make half of the commune's rice fields fully irrigated. However, because it required a large amount of labor, the advanced cooperatives could not afford it. The commune organized large-scale cooperation, mobilized a large number of laborers to build it, and encouraged members to invest, but the funds were still not enough. The commune Party committee then took out 9,000 yuan from the commune's accumulation to solve the difficulty. The dam was built, there was water, and the grain harvest was bountiful. This year's summer grain harvest increased by 57% on the basis of last year's 31% increase. Before communization, 1,263,000 jin of grain had to be transferred in from other areas each year, but last year it changed from a grain shortage to a grain surplus, and 545,000 jin were transferred out; this year, in just one summer, 2,034,000 jin were transferred out, 2.7 times more than the entire year of last year.
    
    The second was that at several critical moments in production, the commune used materials, technology, and funds to help the production brigades overcome difficulties.
    
    In the spring, there was a great shortage of lime needed for topdressing early rice. The commune's saltpeter factory quickly produced three to four thousand jin of saltpeter, blasted the stones, and burned more than 6.1 million jin of lime, with an average of 200 jin applied per mu of land. The members said, "The bountiful summer grain harvest was thanks to the saltpeter factory."
    
    In late spring, the commune's 9,300 mu of sugarcane were infested with "cotton aphids," and a reduction in yield was imminent. The production brigade cadres called the commune for help. The commune then allocated 510,000 jin of pesticides manufactured by the pesticide factory and 700,000 jin of fertilizer produced by the fertilizer factory. First, the pesticides were sprayed, then the fertilizer was topdressed, and the sugarcane was saved. The members said, "When we were farming individually, there was a year when sugarcane was severely reduced due to pests, and everyone cried! After joining the advanced cooperative, there was another pest infestation, and the Jiuxian Advanced Cooperative, which had a large labor force, maintained a good harvest, while the Dawan Advanced Cooperative, which had a small labor force, lost 530 mu. The commune is still good, no brigade suffered losses."
    
    In early summer, just as they were about to vigorously develop sideline occupations, the commune's duck hatchery hatched more than 70,000 ducklings, which were supplied to the production brigades, with an average of six ducks per person, immediately promoting a duck-raising upsurge. Later, the commune's fish farm supplied 1.24 million fish fry, again promoting a fish-farming upsurge.
    
    In the first eight months of this year, the farm tool factory and the bamboo ware factory manufactured more than 30,000 pieces of simple farm machinery, new-style walking plows, various carts, and iron and bamboo farm tools. These farm tools were all supplied "just in time." In addition, the commune also supported the production brigades with 20,000 yuan in revolving funds.
    
    The third was that the commune's accumulation promoted the rapid development of collective cultural and welfare undertakings. After the establishment of the commune, a total of 13,900 yuan was drawn from the commune's accumulation as a foundation to establish a home for the elderly, a maternity hospital, a health clinic, a pharmaceutical factory, and five people-run schools. Thanks to the commune's establishment of cultural and educational undertakings, 99.5% of school-age children attended school. The entire commune originally had 1,901 illiterate people; now, 1,863 of them have a basic understanding of written language.
    
    Helping Poor Teams Catch Up with Rich Teams
    The second achievement is that the commune promoted the balanced economic development of each production brigade—the poor teams catching up with the rich teams, making progress together.
    
    Ertang and Longtian are two poor teams. Ertang is the poorest, with three problems: one is drought, resulting in low grain yields; one is the lack of cash crops, with not a single mu of high-income sugarcane planted; and the other is the small number of sideline occupations, with no orchards and no flocks of ducks. In the era of advanced cooperatives, the masses in Ertang also wanted to solve these problems. However, building a Xiaoshan Reservoir required tens of thousands of workdays, and Ertang had a small labor force, so how could they do it! Without the reservoir, they were always fighting drought after transplanting rice seedlings, and continuing to fight drought until harvest, so how could they spare people to engage in sideline occupations and plant sugarcane?
    
    After communization, with more people and greater strength, the Xiaoshan Reservoir was built, and the members of the Ertang Brigade felt more confident and determined to catch up with the rich teams. During the deep plowing this spring, 100% of the brigade's labor force worked hard, deep plowing the rice fields to a depth of seven inches. In the cold and freezing weather, the members' hands holding the plow were numb with cold, so they warmed them over the fire for a while, then held the plow again, refusing to stop working.
    
    After all, the poor teams have a weak foundation. To catch up with the rich teams, they must comprehensively develop diversified operations. One of the major items is sugarcane. However, the members of the Ertang Brigade had never grown it before, and they did not have sugarcane seeds or sugar presses (the main tool for sugar making). To buy them, the sugarcane seeds would cost 2,400 yuan, and the sugar presses would cost 3,300 yuan, which they didn't have enough money for. They immediately organized more than 100 people to go up the mountain to cut firewood and burn charcoal, earning nearly 1,000 yuan. The commune provided them with 5,200 yuan from the public accumulation. This was a powerful support! The brigade bought sugarcane seeds and sugar presses, and planted sugarcane. Not knowing how to install the sugar presses or how to press the sugar, and planning to send people out to learn, other production brigades took the initiative to help: the Xinwei Brigade sent people to help build the sugar-boiling stove, the Toutang Brigade sent bamboo to build the factory building, and the Jiuxian Brigade sent technicians. People said, "Advanced cooperatives are like uncles and brothers, and production brigades in the commune are like close brothers, how can they not help each other!" Subsequently, the commune's orchard sent 2,000 fruit seedlings, the duck hatchery sent 1,000 ducklings, the fish farm sent 10,000 fish fry, and the pesticide factory sent a batch of pesticides, not only planting sugarcane, but also developing sideline production vigorously. As a result, in just one year since the establishment of the commune, the average income of the Ertang Brigade exceeded the level of the general teams and approached that of the rich teams. Among the commune's ten production teams, the average income per person in the three rich teams was 106.10 yuan, the average income per person in the five general teams was 90.20 yuan, and the Ertang Brigade reached 91.10 yuan. The growth rate of the Longtian Brigade was slightly slower, with an average annual income of 62 yuan per person, which had not yet caught up with the general teams; however, it had increased by 14.56 yuan compared to before communization. The members said: Since the commune has a foundation, we feel like our waists have grown three sizes thicker.
    
    These great contributions of the Fengshan People's Commune could not have been achieved by the advanced cooperatives. After the members realized this from their own experience, they loved the commune even more and connected their fate even more closely with the commune.

    一棵茁壮的新芽
    沈青
    广西柳城县凤山人民公社和其他的人民公社一样，从成立的那一天起，就发挥了“一大二公”的巨大优越性，举办和发展了一批社办企业。社办企业、社办事业和由公社掌握使用的公积金、公益金，虽然还只是一棵蓓蕾，但它是有着旺盛青春活力的新事物。
    新开辟的道路
    凤山公社的社办企业，从一露头儿，就给公社社员带来了好处。
    这件事，要从公社兴办园艺场的经过说起。
    在凤山一带，旧县以盛产沙梨闻名，因此生活比较富裕。公社化以前，附近的许多高级社都想照样多种一些果树。但是，正如社员们当时说的：“果园是座万宝山，宝山好上，难闯‘三关’。”第一是高级社积累的资金很有限，没有钱买果苗；第二是缺乏种果园的技术人材；第三，劳动力有限。
    去年秋天，公社成立了。社员就一而再、再而三地要求公社成立一个苗圃。公社的“组织规模大，活动范围广”，园艺场的架子很快搭起来了：从南丹大队附近划出了十四里方圆的荒岭，从十个大队调来了八十四名男女青年，从旧县调来老果农谢福田，还派党支部书记文锦林担任场长，又拨给六百元开办费。然而，困难仍然很多。荒岭上草比人高，老虎出没无常；没有果苗，也没有那么多的钱去买。公社党委和社员们没有被困难吓倒，他们仔细地作了筹划，研究了克服困难的办法。各个生产大队的社员们也十分热情，说：“偌大一个公社，有什么困难克服不了？“众人抓上一把土，也能塞死一条江。”还说：“公社现在钱少，青年们的伙食费由我们垫支一个月。”场里缺少牲畜和工具，每个大队便送来一头耕牛和一套犁耙。调到园艺场工作的青年们更是干劲十足。岭上草多，他们割了几百担卖了，增加了办场资金；一鼓作气，开出了几百亩荒地，烧了成千担草木灰，老虎也吓跑了。他们又种了几十亩蔬菜，卖得几千元，办场资金绰绰有余了。有三十个青年走遍了附近三个县的荒山野岭，采集了二百多万株野梨树苗。向生产大队收买和收集一些果树枝条，用“单芽嫁接法”，栽下了二百多万株果苗；加上用直播和接枝办法栽种的，共六百四十六万三千多株。青年社员们早起晚睡，辛勤经营。到了今年春天，有一些果苗已经出圃，除去本场移植了六千六百株，供应公社各大队四万五千五百株以外，还卖给外地五万九千九百株。预计今冬明春，又可以出圃一百八十七万株。不到一年工夫，这个只用了六百元现金开办的园艺场，向公社交了一万七千三百五十元的企业利润，自己还置办了价值六千六百二十一元的各种工具和简易机械，并且买了几百本技术参考书。
    公社党委在这期间逐步明确了这样的道理：发展社办企业，虽然也需要国家的支持，但是，主要的办法是依靠群众的志气和两只手。
    一年来，全公社已经有了十二项社办企业。社办企业包括：园艺场、鱼种场、农具厂、硝药厂、化肥厂、农药厂、竹器厂、被服厂、造纸厂、粮食加工厂、建筑材料厂和孵鸭房。由于这些企业是依靠群众勤俭经营办起来的，投资很少、利润很多。十二个企业的基建投资和生产投资总共才用了三万六千五百三十九元，而现在的资产总值却已经发展到二十四万八千一百零七元，增加了将近六倍。这些不断增长着的企业利润，大量为公社提供了积累。1959年1月到8月，公社积累增长了十万零一千七百二十七元。现在，全公社的社办企业和社办事业的资金总值，加上由公社掌握使用的公积金、公益金，已经相当于建社一年里十个生产大队收入总数的21％。这是一件多么令人兴奋的事啊！
    生产上的靠山
    社办企业发展起来以后，在凤山公社立下的第一功，就是促进各个生产大队集体经济“百业齐昌”。社员们的评论是：公社有了家底，大队的生产就有了靠山。
    这一切，表现在三件大事上。
    第一件，用公社积累投资建成了小山水库。过去凤山一带群众说：“旱不得，雨不得，真是扁担没钉，两头担心。”解放后，实现了合作化，群众在一社之内，修了些小型水利，松了一口气；但一遇上大旱，还是不行。有个山坳叫“小山”，筑坝成库，可以使全社半数的稻田成为饱水田。只因需工量大，高级社办不起。公社组织大协作，动员了大批劳动力去修，并且发动社员投资，但是资金还不够，公社党委便从公社积累里拿出九千元，才解决了困难。坝修成了，有了水，粮食获得了大丰收。今年的夏粮，在去年粮食增产31％的基础上，又增产了57％。公社化前，这里一年要从外地调进一百二十六万三千斤粮食，去年由缺粮变余粮，调出五十四万五千斤；今年只是一个夏季，就调出了二百零三万四千斤，比去年全年还增加二点七倍。
    第二件，在几次生产的关键时刻，公社用物质、技术和资金帮助生产大队闯过了难关。
    春天，早稻追肥需要的石灰缺得很多。公社的硝药厂赶忙生产了三、四千斤硝药，炸开了石头，烧成了六百一十多万斤石灰，每亩田平均放了二百斤。社员们说：“夏粮丰收多亏了硝药厂。”
    春末，公社的九千三百多亩甘蔗生了“棉蚜虫”，眼看着就要减收，十分紧急。生产大队的干部给公社打电话请求帮助。公社便把农药厂制造的五十一万斤农药和化肥厂生产的七十万斤化肥拨出。先喷药，后追肥，甘蔗才得救。社员们说：“单干时，有一年甘蔗生虫大减收，哪一家不哭！入了高级社，又闹虫害，人手多的旧县高级社保住了丰收，人手少的大弯高级社就失收了五百三十亩。还是公社好，没有一个大队受损失。”
    夏初，正要大搞副业，公社的孵鸭房孵出了七万多只仔鸭，供应给各个生产大队，每人平均得了六只，一下子就促成了一次养鸭的高潮。以后，公社鱼苗场供应了一百二十四万尾鱼苗，又促成了养鱼的高潮。
    在今年的前八个月里，农具厂和竹器厂制成了三万多件简易农械、新式步犁、各种车子和铁制竹制的农具。这些农具都是供应得“恰逢其时”。另外，公社还支援给生产大队两万元的周转资金。
    第三件，公社的积累促进了集体文化、福利事业的飞跃发展。公社建立以后，共从公社积累里抽出了一万三千九百元作为基金，举办了一所敬老院、一所妇产院、一所卫生院、一所制药厂和五所民办学校。由于公社兴办了文化教育事业，99.5％的学龄儿童都上了学。全公社原有一千九百零一个文盲；现在，其中的一千八百六十三人已经粗通文字了。
    帮助穷队赶富队
    第二功，是公社促使各生产大队的经济发展趋向平衡——穷队赶富队，共同跃进。
    二塘和龙田，是两个穷队。二塘最穷，穷在三个问题上：一个是旱，粮食产量低；一个是没种经济作物，收入高的糖蔗，一亩也没种上；再一个是副业经营的少，果园没有一处，鸭子没有一群。在高级社时代，二塘的群众也想解决这些问题。但是，修个小山水库要几万个工，而二塘劳动力又少，哪里办得了！水库修不成，总是在插完秧后就抗旱，一直抗到收，哪里还抽得出人来搞副业、种甘蔗？
    公社化后，人多力量大，小山水库修成了，二塘大队的社员们心里也亮堂了，立志要赶富队。今春深耕时，全队百分之百的劳动力出工苦战，把稻田深耕七寸。天寒地冻，社员们扶犁的手冻麻了，烘一会火、扶一会犁，也不肯停工。
    穷队毕竟底子薄，要赶上富队，还得全面发展多种经营。其中的一个大头是甘蔗。可是，二塘大队的社员过去从来没有种过，蔗种、糖榨（制糖主要工具）也没有。买吧，蔗种要二千四百元，糖榨要三千三百元，钱不够。马上组织一百多人上山砍柴烧炭，得了差不多一千元。公社从公共积累里提出了五千二百多元支援他们。这是一次有力的支援！大队买了蔗种、糖榨，把甘蔗种上了。有了糖榨又不会安装，也不懂榨法，正想派人出去学，别的生产大队却主动地来支援了：新维大队派人来协助砌熬糖灶，头塘大队送了竹子来盖厂房，旧县大队派来了技术工。人们说：“高级社跟高级社是叔伯兄弟，公社里的生产大队跟生产大队就成为亲兄弟了，哪能不援助！”随后，公社的园艺场又送来了二千株果苗，鸭房送来了一千只鸭仔，鱼场送来了一万尾鱼苗，农药厂送来了一批农药，不仅种上了甘蔗，副业生产也搞得蓬蓬勃勃。结果是：公社建立才一年，二塘大队的平均收入就超过了一般队的水平，接近富队了。全公社的十个生产队里，三个富队每人平均收入是一百零六元一角，五个一般队是九十元二角，二塘大队却达到了九十一元一角。龙田大队的增长速度稍慢，每人平均年收入六十二元，还没赶上一般队；但是比公社化前却增加了十四元五角六分。社员们说：自从公社有了家底，我们腰好像粗了三围。
    凤山人民公社立下的这些汗马功劳，是高级社所办不到的。社员们从切身体验中认识到这一点以后，就越发热爱公社，越发把自己的命运跟公社连结在一起。
