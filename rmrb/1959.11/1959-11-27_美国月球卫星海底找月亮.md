    美国月球卫星海底找月亮
    新华社26日讯  纽约消息：26日，美国试图在佛罗里达州的卡纳维拉尔角当地时间二点二十六分以“阿特拉斯”火箭发射一个人造月球卫星，拍摄月球照片。但是，经过一个多小时以后就宣告失败。这个据说有效重量为三百七十五磅的卫星，落到大海里去找月亮去了。
    “阿特拉斯”是美国目前制造的最大的火箭。在发射后一小时二十八分钟，美国全国星际和空间航行局就宣布失败。它的公报指出：火箭的第二级发生了某些故障。
    公报说：在火箭发射七十秒钟后，第二级上装置的无线电遥测仪器就停止了工作。第二级发动机没有开动。目力观察到有某一东西从火箭上落下，接着，与火箭的遥测联系就中断了。火箭可能落到卡纳维拉尔角东南方的大西洋之中。
