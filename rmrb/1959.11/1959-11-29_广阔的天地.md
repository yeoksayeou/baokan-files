	The Vast Expanse of Heaven and Earth
	Peat Refines Petroleum
	The Yushu County Comprehensive Chemical Plant in Jilin Province uses peat for pile dry distillation, refining petroleum, phosphate, potash, and ammonia water (chemical fertilizer). According to the materials from this chemical plant, every hundred catties of peat can produce more than thirty-two catties of petroleum, more than fifty-two catties of peat ash, and twenty-three catties of ammonia water.
	Peat is extremely abundant in Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces. Preliminary estimates suggest that Jilin Province alone has reserves of 1.3 billion tons.
	Pine Branches Emit Fragrance
	The Wuzhu Oil Refinery in Longxi County, Gansu Province, uses coal slack and trimmed pine branches as raw materials. Through internal heating and pile dry distillation, it has extracted a large amount of turpentine, kerosene, light diesel, and heavy diesel, totaling fourteen products.
	With the development of afforestation, pine tree resources are very rich. Using the trimmed pine branches to refine oil is an exotic flower blooming in the widespread development of the petroleum industry.
	Coal Slurry Has Many Treasures
	After coking coal is washed and sorted, what remains is coal slurry and dross. In the past, these drosses were often piled up as waste or used as fuel for domestic heating. The workers of the Xuecheng Coking Plant in Shandong Province use this coal slurry for pile dry distillation. Preliminary tests alone have extracted 1.7% coal tar. The coal slurry and dross after dry distillation become semi-coke. This semi-coke is used for burning boilers or heating, and its calorific value is higher than directly using coal slurry and dross.
		Waste Oil Shines
	The Gannan Fuel Station in Jiangxi Province has established a waste oil refining factory, specializing in the recovery of waste oil from factories and enterprises in the Gannan area, refining products such as gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and machine oil. This factory has only six workers and some simple equipment, producing more than a thousand catties of various oils daily.
	Oilseed Cake Also Contains Oil
	The Luoshan Comprehensive Reclamation Farm in Chongren County, Jiangxi Province, uses indigenous methods to extract petroleum from oil-tea seed cake. According to the experiments of this reclamation farm, after dry distilling oil-tea seed cake, every nine hundred catties of cake can yield over sixty catties of kerosene and diesel after fractionation.

    广阔的天地
    草炭炼石油
    吉林省榆树县综合化工厂利用草炭进行成堆干馏，炼出了石油、磷钾和氨水（化学肥料）。据这个化工厂的材料证明，每百斤草炭可以出三十二斤多石油，五十二斤多草炭灰和二十三斤氨水。
    草炭在黑龙江省和吉林省储量极为丰富，仅吉林省初步估计就有十三亿吨的储量。
    松枝放异香
    甘肃省陇西县五竹炼油厂，利用草煤和修整下来的松枝作原料，用内热试成堆干馏方法，提炼出大量松节油、煤油、轻柴油和重柴油等十四种产品。
    随着绿化事业的发展，松树资源十分丰富，利用整枝下来的松枝炼油，是石油工业遍地开花中的一朵异花。
    煤泥宝贝多
    炼焦煤经过洗选以后，剩下的是煤泥和渣子，过去这些渣子往往当做废料堆积起来，或作为家庭取暖用的燃料。山东省薛城焦厂的职工，利用这种煤泥进行成堆干馏，仅初步试验即提取出1.7％煤焦油，干馏后的煤泥和渣子变成了半焦，这种半焦用来烧锅炉或取暖，比直接用煤泥和渣子的热值还高。
        废油射光芒
    江西省赣南燃料站建立了一个废机油提炼工厂，专门回收赣南区各工厂企业中的废机油，提炼汽油、煤油、柴油和机油等产品。这个厂只有六个工人和一些简单设备，每日产各种油一千多斤。
    枯饼也含油
    江西省崇仁县罗山综合垦殖场利用土办法，从油茶籽枯饼中提炼出石油。据这个垦殖场的试验，用油茶枯饼干馏后，每九百斤枯饼得到的原油经分馏后，可得煤油、柴油六十余斤。
