    Grain Processing No Longer Needs Donkeys: Utilizing Water Power to Run Machines
    Zhongning County Achieves Water-Powered Milling
    Editor's Note: Zhongning County has basically achieved semi-automation of grain processing tools by utilizing water power. It is estimated that water-powered processing is 18 to 36 times more efficient than animal-powered milling. This reform alone has not only fundamentally solved the difficulties of grain processing in the county, but also saved more than 520,000 labor-days and the same number of animal power days this year. This is another major achievement in the tool reform movement, playing a significant role in solving the shortage of labor and animal power.
    A high tide of water conservancy construction has now formed in rural areas. It is hoped that while accelerating water conservancy construction, all localities will also study and solve the problem of how to improve the comprehensive utilization of water and allow water to serve people better in many ways, adapting measures to local conditions.
    According to the Ningxia Daily, along the 300-kilometer-long Yellow River in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, canals are crisscrossed, and water resources are abundant. After the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes in 1958, Zhongning County made full use of water resources to process grain. Up to now, there are 44 hydropower stations, 3 hydroelectric power stations, and a total of 44 water-powered grinding stones installed (including 21 semi-automated ones, and 15 double-roller mills), and 47 water mills (including 2 dual-purpose electric and water-powered double mills, 8 automatic water mills, and 17 semi-automatic water mills). 80% of the communes and 83% of the brigades in the county have established hydropower stations and use water-powered grinding stones and water mills to process grain.
    The use of water power for processing in Zhongning County has saved a large amount of labor and animal power and improved work efficiency. The county's existing 91 various types of water-powered grinding stones and water mills require only 218 laborers to operate in shifts. Calculated on the basis of 24 hours a day and 240 normal working days per year, a total of 70,164,400 jin of finished rice and flour can be processed. If these rice and flour were processed by animal power, it would take 574,300 labor-days and the same number of animal power days. Calculating it this way, after using water-powered grinding stones and water mills to process grain, more than 521,900 labor-days and the same number of animal power days can be saved throughout the year. Calculated at 365 workdays equivalent to one laborer or animal, a total of more than 1,400 laborers and animals each can be saved annually. Using these labor and animals for farming or other production can create more wealth for society and increase a considerable amount of income for the commune. The grain processed by these water-powered grinding stones and water mills in the county annually has exceeded the county's ration quota standard by 39%, so in addition to processing grain for their own use, a large amount of commercial grain can be processed for the state every year.
    Water-powered grinding stones and water mills have high work efficiency, simple structure, and low cost. A semi-automated water mill built by the Walu Brigade of the Ning'an Commune cost a total of 1,200 yuan, including labor and materials. This mill can process 1,500 jin of flour in 24 hours every day. Using it for 240 days a year, calculated at a processing fee of 1.5 yuan per 100 jin, a total of 5,400 yuan in processing fees can be earned. In addition to the cost of this mill, these funds can also be used to build three similar mills.
    The development of water-powered processing tools in Zhongning County has progressed gradually from small to large, from indigenous to modern. Before 1956, there were only a few old-fashioned water mills in the county. After cooperation, they were improved into single-roller water-powered grinding stones and water mills. These mills are three times more efficient than animal-powered ones and can save nine laborers and twelve animals; however, processes such as adding materials, sifting flour, and winnowing rice still require manual operation. After the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, the county party committee put forward the call to "eliminate donkeys from grain and oil processing and use water and electricity to drive machines." Iron and wood technicians and the broad masses of the county broke down superstitions and carried out large-scale technical innovations, gradually reforming old-fashioned water-powered grinding stones and water mills into automated and semi-automated ones. Li Quanfu, a carpenter from the Walu Brigade of the Ning'an Commune, based on the old-fashioned water mill, modified a semi-automated water mill using water power to drive the roller sieve. This innovation quickly spread everywhere. Then, in the spring of this year, Li Quanfu added a conveyor to the roller sieve, automating the entire process from loading wheat to producing flour; and imitating the principle of the water mill, he created a double-roller semi-automated water-powered grinding stone. The county-level leading organs held an on-site meeting here, and each commune sent people to visit and learn, promoting the reform of water-powered grinding stones and water mills. Wang Yucai, a carpenter from the Enhe Commune, also imitated the principle of water mill automation, using the water turbine of the hydropower station to create a dual-purpose electric and water-powered double automatic mill. After two years of continuous innovation, the forms of water-powered grinding stones and water mills are diverse, and a hundred flowers are blooming.
    The CCP Zhongning County Committee has been closely monitoring the water-powered milling of grain processing. From the county to the commune to the brigade, the secretaries personally took charge. The county also established a mechanization office and equipped it with specialized technical personnel to guide this work. After Wei Zhanying, the secretary of the Enhe Commune Party Committee, and worker Wang Yucai cooperated in research and created a double automatic water mill, Zhang Xuezhong, the secretary of the Mingsha Commune Party Committee, led 48 cadres above the level of branch secretary from the entire commune to study the experience of the Enhe Commune. In the commune's hydropower station, they created a set of double four-roller automated water-powered grinding stones. The automated water-powered grinding stones and water mills of the Walu Brigade were also created in cooperation with Li Jinzhong and Dai Hongru, the general branch secretaries, and carpenters Li Quanfu and Li Zhiye. Wherever there was advanced experience, the county held on-site meetings there, comprehensively promoted it, and awarded red flags to advanced units. In this way, a wave of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced was set off in the improvement of water-powered milling tools. You reformed, I innovated, the forms were diverse, the progress was step by step, the flowers bloomed everywhere, and the water-powered milling of rice and flour processing tools was quickly realized.

    粮食加工不用驴  利用水力带机器
    中宁县实现水碾水磨化
    编者按：中宁县利用水力基本实现粮食加工工具半自动化。据估算，水力加工要比畜力拉磨拉碾提高效率十八倍至三十六倍。该县仅此一项改革，不仅根本解决了粮食加工的困难，而且今年可节省五十二万多个劳动工日和同样的畜力工日，这是工具改革运动中的又一重大成就，对解决劳畜力不足的困难起着重大作用。
    现在农村兴修水利的高潮已经形成。希望各地在加速水利建设的同时，对如何提高水的综合利用，让水从多方面更好地为人服务的问题，也能因地制宜地加以研究解决。
    据宁夏日报消息　宁夏回族自治区三百公里长的黄河两岸，到处渠道纵横，水力资源丰富。1958年大跃进和人民公社化以后，中宁县充分利用水力资源加工粮食。到目前为止，全县计有水力站四十四处，水力电站三处，共安装水碾四十四盘（其中半自动化的二十一盘，双磙碾十五盘）、水磨四十七盘（其中电力、水力两用双盘磨两盘，自动水磨八盘，半自动水磨十七盘）。全县已有80％的公社和83％的大队建立了水力站，利用水碾、水磨加工粮食。
    中宁县利用水力加工，节省了大批劳畜力，提高了工效。全县现有的九十一盘各种类型的水碾、水磨，只用二百一十八个劳力轮流操作，每天按二十四小时、全年按二百四十天正常工作时间计算，共可加工成品米面七千零十六万四千斤。这些米面如果用畜力磨加工，得花五十七万四千三百个劳动工日和同样的畜力工日。这样计算下来，利用水碾、水磨加工粮食以后，全年就可节省五十二万一千九百多个劳动工日和同样的畜力工日；按三百六十五个工日折合一个劳力或畜力计算，一年共节省劳畜力各一千四百多个。用这些劳、畜力种田或从事其它生产，又可以为社会创造更多的财富，为公社增加很大一笔收入。全县这些水碾、水磨，一年加工的粮食已经超过全县口粮定量标准39％，所以每年除加工自用口粮外，还可给国家加工大批商品粮食。
    水碾、水磨工效高，构造简单，造价低廉。宁安公社洼路大队建造的一座半自动化水磨，包括工料，共花了一千二百元。这座磨每天使用二十四小时，共可加工一千五百斤面粉。全年使用二百四十天，按每百斤加工费一元五角计算，共可收入加工费五千四百元。这些钱，除这盘磨的造价外，还可以建造同样的三盘磨。
    中宁县水力加工工具的发展，是由小到大、由土到洋，逐步发展起来的。1956年以前，全县只有几盘老式水磨。合作化后，改良成单磙水碾、水磨，这些碾、磨比畜力碾、磨提高工效三倍，可以节省九个劳力，十二个畜力；但加料、箩面、搧米等工序，仍需人力操作。大跃进和人民公社化以后，县委提出“粮油加工不用驴，水力电力带机器”的号召，全县铁、木技术工人和广大群众，破除了迷信，大搞技术革新，把老式水碾、水磨逐步改革成自动化和半自动化。宁安公社洼路大队的木工李全福，在老式水磨的基础上，改制出用水力带磙筒箩的半自动化水磨。这一创举很快遍地开花。接着，在今年春天，李全福又给磙筒箩加上输送器，从装麦到出面，全部自动化；并仿照水磨的原理，创造出一盘双磙半自动化水碾。县级领导机关在这里召开了现场会议，各公社都派人前来参观学习，促进了对水碾、水磨的改革工作。恩和公社的木工王玉才，又仿照水磨自动化的原理，利用水电站的水轮机，创造出电力、水力两用双盘自动磨。经过两年来的不断革新，水碾、水磨的形式多种多样，百花齐放。
    中共中宁县委对粮食加工水碾、水磨化抓得很紧，从县到公社、到大队，都由书记亲自挂帅，县上并成立了机械化办公室，配备专门技术人员指导这一工作。恩和公社党委书记魏占英、工人王玉才合作研究，创造了双盘自动水力磨以后，鸣沙公社党委书记张学忠率领全社支部书记以上的干部四十八人，学习了恩和公社的经验，在本社水电站内，又创造了一套双盘四磙自动化水碾。洼路大队的自动化水碾、水磨，也是总支书记李进忠、戴鸿儒和木工李全福、李治业合作创造的。哪里有了先进经验，县上就在哪里开现场会，全面推广，插红旗奖励先进。这样，就在水碾水磨加工工具的改良上，掀起了一个学先进、赶先进、超先进的热潮，你改我创，形式多样，步步提高，遍地开花，很快实现了米面加工工具的水碾水磨化。
