Guangxi Has a Rubber Factory

Guangxi's first modern rubber factory, the newly built Nanning Rubber Factory's first phase of construction has been completed and has begun to produce large quantities of products such as rubber hoses, conveyor belts, and V-belts to support industry, transportation, and the current drought resistance needs of the Nanning area's countryside. The factory's main products include automobile and tractor tires, animal-drawn cart and bicycle tires, conveyor belts, transmission belts, V-belts, rubber hoses, and rubber shoes.
