	Great Rapeseed
	At the Xiangride Farm, there is a large rapeseed plant that looks like a tree. It takes four adults to encircle it with their arms, and children can take shelter under it.

	This rapeseed plant is 2.34 meters tall, its main stem is 17 centimeters thick, and it has 25 branches, each with 13 or 14 sub-branches, bearing a total of more than 59,000 pods and more than 1.2 million seeds.

	Perennial Cucumbers and Tomatoes
	Wei Chengshu, a 69-year-old worker at the Kunlun Farm in Golmud, has cultivated perennial cucumbers and tomatoes in a greenhouse. The vines of these cucumbers and tomatoes are as thick as a child's arm and are laden with fruit. They were planted three years ago and bear fruit three times a year.

	These herbaceous plants have become like woody plants.

	"2419" Wheat Gained Weight in Nanda
	The "2419" spring wheat from Nanda, sown this year at farms in Delingha, Xiangride, and other places, has particularly plump grains, weighing 46.5 grams per thousand grains. When this variety was transferred from the mainland, the weight per thousand grains was only 28 grams. After being planted in the Qaidam Basin, the weight per thousand grains increased by 66 percent.

    柴达木农业珍闻
    大油菜
    香日德农场有一棵大油菜，长得像一棵树，四个大人伸手围不拢，小朋友可以在下面乘凉。
    这棵油菜高二点三四米，主茎十七厘米粗，二十五个分枝，每个分枝有十三、四个分杈，共结荚五万九千多个，结籽一百二十多万粒。
    多年生的黄瓜和西红柿
    格尔木昆仑农场六十九岁的老工人魏承淑，在温室里培育成多年生的黄瓜和西红柿。这种黄瓜和西红柿的茎蔓，像小孩的胳膊粗，结实累累。它们都是三年前栽培的，每年可结三槎。
    这些草本植物已经变得像木本植物了。
    南大“二四一九”增重
    德令哈、香日德等农场今年播种的南大“二四一九”春小麦，籽粒特别饱满，每千粒重达四十六克半。当这个品种从内地调来时，千粒重才有二十八克。经过在柴达木种植，千粒重增长了百分之六十六。
