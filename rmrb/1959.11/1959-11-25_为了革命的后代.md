Harbin Theatre's "In the Name of Revolution"

    For the Sake of Revolutionary Descendants
    Meng Chao
    The Harbin Theatre's performance of two famous Soviet plays, "An Optimistic Tragedy" and "In the Name of Revolution," has given the capital's audiences great artistic pleasure. Not only were the plays well-chosen, but the director, actors, and all the stage artists showed a strong political enthusiasm, truly achieving both the requirements of the original plays and artistic originality. However, I feel it is particularly important to emphasize that staging these two plays reflecting the early history of the Soviet revolution on the Chinese stage today not only helps our people understand the indomitable class struggle of the world's first socialist country at the beginning of its founding, laying a solid foundation for today's immensely powerful socialist camp, thereby deepening the unwavering friendship between brotherly countries; but especially in the current socialist construction of our country, under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, a continuous series of great leaps forward are being promoted. Through the performance of these two famous plays, let us revisit the revolutionary history of our great ally, deepen our understanding of the fine traditions of the international communist movement, and I believe that it will strengthen our fighting spirit to forge ahead bravely. Many comrades have already commented on "An Optimistic Tragedy," and here I would just like to talk about "In the Name of Revolution."
    Mikhail Shatrov's "In the Name of Revolution" is a good play with a distinctive style, not only portraying many innocent and enthusiastic young people full of revolutionary fervor, but also powerfully sculpting the glorious images of the great revolutionary giant Lenin and his loyal comrade Dzerzhinsky. The whole play is like peeling a bamboo shoot, layer by layer, tightly grasping the theme and developing forward, its writing style is lively and fresh, yet profound and precise. The historical background of this play is during the world-shaking year of 1918, when the young Soviet regime was just established, and hunger and the covert counterattacks of counter-revolutionary elements subjected the revolution to arduous tests. The play depicts the various experiences of the two sons of a Red Army soldier killed by right-wing Socialist-Revolutionaries—Vasya and Petya—from their extremely naive and vague aspirations for the revolutionary regime, to their unknowingly being used by the reactionaries, to their mature participation in the Workers' Youth League and their heroic struggle against the reactionaries, and finally, their seeing Lenin in the Kremlin and receiving supreme encouragement and care. At the same time, it also profoundly demonstrates Lenin and Dzerzhinsky's great love for the younger generation, their strong confidence in the cause of socialism and communism, and their brilliant leadership; and it vividly exposes the harm of the right-wing Socialist-Revolutionaries to the revolution, creating a complex and acute class struggle. Because the plot of this play is tortuous and circuitous, some people seem to think that it is basically a melodrama. We will not even say that plot is one of the important conditions for the composition of drama; even in terms of this play, the plot is to depict the revolutionary struggle, the plot is to express the pulsation of political thought, such a drama plot has a very deep political education role, such a drama with political significance and tortuous plot, the organic and close combination of the two, is exactly what we need.
    After watching this play, it naturally made me think of the many stubborn and vagrant children described in Makarenko's "The Road to Life." Of course, I also thought of the significance of that book for educating the younger generation and making them heroic fighters for socialist construction, but I found its powerful footnote in this play. Before Lenin and Dzerzhinsky met Vasya and Petya in Moscow, on the one hand, they saw Dzerzhinsky take out the provocative and reactionary program of the Chairman of the Cadet Union, saying that they would actively carry out work among the proletarian youth, and pull the youth to their side, but in fact the counter-revolutionary elements were disguising themselves as revolutionaries. They shot our comrades from dark corners at night, blew up bridges, strangled us with hunger, and poisoned children, but during the day they shouted freedom, equality, and fraternity! Therefore, Lenin made a firm decision: "In the name of revolution, give help to all the poor children in the shortest possible time!" And he pointed out, "...In this name, we will establish a new life for our children, and in this name, we will mercilessly punish those who deprive children of happiness..." This precisely illustrates that the greatest love for one's own class is to be ruthless to the enemy, and ruthlessness to the enemy is precisely the most powerful protection for the working class's own next generation and for one's own regime. On the other hand, we also saw that the right-wing Socialist-Revolutionaries organized secret activities, carried out assassinations and sabotage everywhere, and even infiltrated our heart, the Cheka. From these aspects, irrefutable evidence proves how cruel the enemy is, and how the harm to the Soviet regime is painstakingly and exhaustively done; this is again seeing the acuteness of the class struggle from the reverse side. Based on the above points, although the plot of this play is complicated and involves many aspects, it can be summarized in one sentence: it is to expound the essence of class struggle, so the educational significance of this play is extremely profound.
    The theme of "In the Name of Revolution" does not stop there. In the last scene, when Vasya and Petya met Lenin in the Kremlin, Lenin repeatedly muttered "In the name of revolution," and also kindly told Petya: "You must know, we are brothers, we both have been shot by the Socialist-Revolutionaries," asking him: "Does it hurt?" This not only illustrates the great revolutionary mentor's love for children, but more importantly, that the two generations before and after the revolution are inextricably linked, not only when the Soviet regime was being created, but also when building socialism and communism. At the end of the play, Lenin earnestly tells us: "How much I want to see Russia in forty or fifty years!... All our young generation are full of vigor... If they bravely move forward in hunger and cold; fight for a new life, and unhesitatingly dedicate their lives, what else is there to doubt. We must remind everyone in the name of revolution to always remember for the sake of revolution." The young generation in China, in the course of the revolution, although it cannot be said that they are completely the same as the young generation in the Soviet Union, they are the same in one point: for the sake of revolution. Looking at the famous Soviet play, listening to Lenin's earnest teachings, and revisiting the revolutionary history of the working class through stage images, I think it will be greatly inspiring. Therefore, the political nature of this play, the educational significance of this play, is so profoundly rich!

专栏：哈尔滨话剧院的以革命的名义

    为了革命的后代
    孟超
    哈尔滨话剧院这次来京演出了两部苏联名剧“乐观的悲剧”和“以革命的名义”，给首都观众以很大的艺术享受，不但剧本选择得好，而且导演、演员以及一切舞台艺术工作者，都显露出强烈的政治热情，的确做到了符合原剧要求而又有艺术上的独创。然而我觉得更应该特别着重提出的是：在今天中国舞台上上演这两部反映苏联革命初期史实的剧作，固然有助于我国人民了解世界上第一个社会主义国家在建国开始时的坚韧不拔的阶级斗争，为今天强大无比的社会主义阵营奠立下巩固的基础，从而加深兄弟国家间的不渝的友谊；但特别是在当前我国社会主义建设事业，在党的社会主义总路线的光辉照耀之下，一个一个继续不断的万马奔腾的大跃进向前推进着，通过这两个名剧的上演，让我们温习一番我们伟大的盟邦的革命历史，加深对国际共产主义运动的优良传统的认识，我想是会更能加强斗志奋勇前进的。“乐观的悲剧”已有不少的同志评论过了，在这里我仅想谈一谈“以革命的名义”。
    米·沙特洛夫的“以革命的名义”，是别具风格的好戏，既刻划出许多天真无邪而充沛着饱满的革命热情的青年一代，也有力地雕塑出伟大的革命巨人列宁和他的忠实战友捷尔仁斯基的光辉形象，全剧如剥春笋，层层脱退，而扣紧了主题思想，向前发展着，其笔锋所及，灵动清新却又深刻精确。这剧的历史背景是在撼动世界的1918年间，那时年轻的苏维埃政权刚建立不久，饥饿和反革命分子的暗中反扑，使革命受着艰苦的考验。剧中通过被右派社会革命党人打死了的红军战士的两个儿子——瓦夏与别佳——的种种遭遇：从他们对革命政权的极幼稚而朦胧的憧憬，到毫不自知的为反动派所利用，到他们成熟的参加了工人青年团而和反动派作着英勇的搏斗，最后终于在克里姆林宫见到了列宁，受到了无上的鼓舞与关怀；同时，更深刻地表现出列宁与捷尔仁斯基对青年一代的伟大的爱，对社会主义与共产主义事业的坚强的信心和英明的领导；而且形象地揭露了右派社会革命党人的对革命的危害，造成了复杂、尖锐的阶级斗争。由于这剧的剧情曲折迂转，似乎有人认为基本上还是一个情节剧，我们且不说情节是戏剧构成的重要条件之一；即就这剧而言，情节是为了描叙革命斗争，情节是表现了政治思想的脉搏的跳动，这样的戏剧情节是有着极深的政治教育作用，这样的有政治意义而又具有曲折情节，两者有机的紧密结合着的戏，正是我们所需要的。
    看了这剧，很自然的使我联想到马卡连柯“教育诗”中所描述的许多倔强性格的流浪儿童，当然也想到了那本书对于教育青年一代而使其成为社会主义建设的英勇的战士的意义，但我更从这剧中，找到了它的有力的注脚。当列宁与捷尔仁斯基在莫斯科见到了瓦夏与别佳之前，一方面看到捷尔仁斯基从怀里掏出的士官生联盟主席的挑拨性的反动纲领，说甚么要在无产阶级青年中间积极展开工作，把青年拉到他们那方面去，而事实上反革命分子正是伪装革命，他们晚间从黑暗的角落里枪杀我们同志，炸毁桥梁，用饥饿扼杀我们，毒死儿童，可是在白天他们却叫喊自由、平等和友爱！因此列宁就作出了坚决的决定：“以革命的名义，在最短的时间内，对所有的贫苦儿童给予帮助！”而且指出“……以这个名义给我们的儿童建立新的生活，并且以这个名义无情地惩罚那些剥夺儿童幸福的人……”这正说明了对自己阶级的最大的爱就要对敌人毫不容情，对敌人的无情也正是对工人阶级自己的下一代、对自己的政权的最有力的保护。另一方面，我们也看到右派社会革命党人组织秘密活动，到处进行暗杀破坏，一直打入我们的心脏肃反委员会中。从这些方面，铁证如山地证明敌人是如何的残酷，对苏维埃政权的危害是挖空心思、无所不用其极的；这又是从反面看到阶级斗争的尖锐性。根据以上各点，这剧虽然情节复杂，牵扯的方面较多，但一言以蔽之，就是为了阐述阶级斗争的实质，因此这剧的教育意义是极为深刻的。
    “以革命的名义”这个剧的主题思想，还不仅止于此。当最后一场瓦夏和别佳在克里姆林宫见到了列宁，列宁反复的叨念着“以革命的名义”，也亲切地告诉别佳说：“要知道，我们是弟兄啊，我们两个人都吃过社会革命党人的枪子，”问他：“疼不疼？”这不只说明了伟大的革命导师对于儿童的慈爱，更重要的是革命的前后两代是血肉相连的，不仅在苏维埃政权缔造时是如此，而在建设社会主义、共产主义的时代仍然是如此的。在这剧结尾时，列宁谆谆的告诉我们说：“我是多末想看见四五十年以后的俄罗斯啊！……所有我们的青年一代都是朝气勃勃的……如果他们在饥寒交迫之中，勇往直前；为了新的生活而去斗争，毫不犹豫地献出自己的生命，还有甚么可怀疑的。我们要以革命的名义提醒大家时刻记住为了革命。”中国的青年一代，在革命的进程中，虽不能说完全和苏联青年一代一样，但在为了革命的一点上是同样的，看一看苏联的名剧，听一听列宁的殷切的教诲，通过舞台形象温习一番工人阶级的革命历史，我看是会有极大的激发。因此这剧的政治性、这剧的教育意义，又是多末深刻丰富啊！
