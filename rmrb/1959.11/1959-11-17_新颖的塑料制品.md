    Novel Plastic Products
    Unbreakable Kettle
    The Shanghai Plastic Products Factory has recently produced kettles made of polyethylene. This kind of kettle is tough, heat-resistant, cold-resistant, and not easily deformed. When filled with boiling water, it can keep warm for more than four hours. The kettle body is lightweight and easy to carry.
    Non-fading Rose
    Plastic roses are made of polyethylene with added fragrance. They look exactly like real roses, with both color and fragrance, but they do not wither or fade, and they can return to their original shape even after being crushed. If they get dusty, they can be cleaned with cold water. This was successfully created by the Shanghai No. 3 Plastics Factory.

    新颖的塑料制品
    不碎的水壶
    上海塑料制品厂最近用聚乙烯制成水壶。这种水壶质地坚韧，耐热、耐寒，不易变形。注入沸水，能保暖四小时以上。壶体分量轻，携带方便。
    不褪色的玫瑰
    塑料玫瑰花是用聚乙烯加香料制成的。它与真的玫瑰一个模样，色香俱全，但不雕谢，也永不褪色，压瘪后仍能恢复原形。如果蒙上灰尘，可用冷水洗刷清洁。它是上海塑料三厂创制成功的。
