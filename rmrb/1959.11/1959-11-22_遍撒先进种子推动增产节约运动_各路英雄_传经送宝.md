Xinhua News Agency report:

    Since returning to their work posts after attending the National Congress of Heroes, the heroes from all quarters have immediately conveyed the instructions of Party and state leaders at the Congress and the Congress’s great achievements. They have also actively disseminated advanced thoughts and advanced experiences, promoting the increase production and practice economy movement to form a new high tide.

    In provinces, cities, and autonomous regions such as Heilongjiang and Shaanxi, welcome meetings were held immediately after the representatives returned, where the representatives conveyed the spirit of the Congress. Hubei Province, Fujian Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and others held radio broadcasts. The more than two hundred representatives from Hubei Province who attended the Congress put forward five guarantees to the province's workers at the broadcast meeting: First, resolutely listen to the Party, be promoters of implementing the General Line, and comprehensively complete tasks; Second, ensure a balanced increase in production; Third, continue to liberate thought, use your brains, strive to study science and technology, and vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution; Fourth, actively participate in the competition to learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward; Fifth, strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao’s works, and study cultural and scientific and technological knowledge, to be both red and expert, thoroughly red and deeply expert, and better play a leading role, a backbone role, and a bridge role.

    Currently, a "passing on experiences and giving treasures" campaign with leadership, organization, rich content, and diverse forms has been widely launched in various places, powerfully promoting the increase production and practice economy movement. In recent days, representatives from Zhejiang Province have been passing on experiences and giving treasures in Hangzhou City, giving more than one hundred and fifty reports and holding multiple operation demonstrations and experience exchange meetings. The more than three hundred representatives from Jiangsu Province learned more than one thousand advanced experiences at the National Congress of Heroes. After returning to their production posts, they quickly disseminated these experiences through various forms such as report meetings, symposiums, and technical performances. In Nanjing, Suzhou, and Changzhou, more than 170,000 workers have listened to various reports from representatives in the past few days. After listening to the representatives' reports, the more than four hundred workers in the third workshop of the Nanjing Teaching Instrument Factory implemented more than six hundred innovation proposals in one day and night. After returning to Zhengzhou, the two hundred and thirty-nine representatives from Henan Province who attended the National Congress of Heroes immediately spread advanced experiences to the city's workers. Famous technical innovation experts Wang Benzhen and Yao Changyou, and others, greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the 1,800 workers at the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory after sharing their experiences, and a new upsurge of technical innovation quickly formed throughout the factory. On the 15th, Zhou Rongbao, an old worker in the forging workshop, improved the punching die tool, increasing production efficiency by more than forty times.

    Since returning to Changchun, Jilin Province, the representatives attending the National Congress of Heroes have conveyed advanced experiences and advanced thoughts to more than 123,000 people in more than 160 units in Changchun City in recent days. Metallurgical system representatives Liu Deyi, Li Mao, Ou Kuiyu, Tang Deheng, and others, shared twenty advanced experiences, such as stabilizing blast furnace air temperature and ensuring coking quality, with three steel plants, including the Changchun East Station Iron and Steel Plant. After learning the "non-stop air adding material" and other experiences shared by the heroes, the workers of the Changchun Steel Plant reduced the smelting time of a furnace of steel from twenty-four minutes to eighteen minutes. The representatives from Shenyang City attending the National Congress of Heroes are spreading the seeds of advanced thinking and advanced experience to every corner of the city, causing the upsurge of the increase production and practice economy competition in the city to roll up even bigger and higher waves. In the Shenyang Transformer Factory where Congress representative Wang Fengen works, more than eight hundred technical innovations have been realized in the past week, and the work efficiency of more than two thousand eight hundred people in the factory has increased by more than 10%. Han Baotai, a worker in the woodworking workshop of the Shenyang Cable Factory, created crushers, electric saws, and other items with the help of Congress representative Zhang Jialu and other veteran workers, solving key problems in production and being named the factory's red flag bearer.

    Many representatives have also been invited to other places to spread advanced experiences. For example, Zhao Mengtao and Xu Yongji, well-known advanced producers in the Northwest region, were invited to Jilin Province to introduce advanced experiences and advanced ideas. The one hundred and fifty-two representatives from Yunnan Province were invited to Guiyang City to introduce their advanced experiences and deeds to the workers of various factories.
