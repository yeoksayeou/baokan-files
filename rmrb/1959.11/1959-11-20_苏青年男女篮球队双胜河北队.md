Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 19th: The Soviet National Youth Men's and Women's Basketball Teams held their fourth friendly match in China tonight at the Tianjin Gymnasium. As a result, the Soviet women's team defeated the Hebei women's team with a score of 63 to 60. The Soviet men's team defeated the Hebei men's team with a score of 90 to 80.

    The women's game was very tense. The Hebei team took the lead first. After taking a 4-2 lead, they maintained a lead of two or three points. The first half ended with a score of 31 to 26, with Hebei leading by five points. Facing opponents who were taller and faster, the Hebei team members were very active in rebounding and shooting. The shooting percentage was also very high. Forward Yong Rong alone scored 13 points in the first half.

    Six minutes into the second half, under the full counterattack of the visiting team, a 39-39 tie appeared—the second tie since 2-2. Then, Hebei team forwards Yong Rong and Chen Xiushan scored two more consecutive goals, still leading 43-39 by four points. Not long after the visiting team tied the score for the third time at 43-43, they began to gain the upper hand with a lead of three or four points. In the last three minutes, when the competition was at its fiercest, Hebei's key players, Fu Bin and Yong Rong, were both sent off after committing five fouls, and finally lost by three points with a score of 60-63.

    In the men's game, the Hebei team displayed its characteristics of speed and agility. Center Wang Jiazhen, An Yuping, and others frequently scored with sneak attacks or layups. The visiting team countered with speed, and the score remained very close. There were nine ties in the first half. At the end of the half, the visiting team led 55-44.

    In the second half, the Hebei team strengthened its defense, sometimes pressing tightly and sometimes using zone defense, closely guarding several of the visiting team's scoring experts, and once narrowed the gap to 60-66 and 76-82, only six points behind. At this time, the visiting team substituted Valjtin (No. 4), a scoring expert standing at 2.01 meters, bringing the number of tall players around two meters to three, and the score gradually rose again. In the end, the visiting team won by ten points.

    After the game, Hebei Province Vice Governor Gao Shuxun and others met with the athletes from both teams.

    苏青年男女篮球队双胜河北队
    据新华社天津19日电　苏联国家青年男、女篮球队今晚在天津体育馆举行访华第四次友谊比赛，结果苏联女子队以六十三比六十战胜了河北女子队。苏联男子队以九十比八十胜河北男子队。
    女子队的比赛十分紧张，河北队，首先取得了优势，从四比二领先以后，一直保持多得两三个球，上半场结束时以三十一比二十六领先五分。河北队队员在身体高、速度快的对手面前，抢球、投篮都非常积极。投篮的命中率也很高。仅前锋雍容在上半场就独得十三分。
    下半场开始后六分钟，在客队的全力反攻下，出现了三十九比三十九——自二比二以来的第二次平局。接着，河北队前锋雍容、陈秀珊又连中两球，仍以四十三比三十九领先四分。不久客队追到四十三比四十三第三次平局以后，开始以多得三、四分的优势占了上风。到最后三分钟，双方争夺最激烈的时候，河北队的主力队员傅彬和雍容都先后五次犯规下场，最后终于以六十比六十三输了三分。
    男子队比赛中，河北队发挥了快速、灵活的特点，中锋王家桢、安毓平等人频频偷袭或切入上篮得分。而客队更是以快治快，比分始终很接近，上半场曾出现了九次平局，结束时，客队以五十五比四十四领先。
    下半场，河北队加强了防守，忽而紧逼，忽而联防，牢牢地看住了客队几个得分能手，曾追到六十比六十六、七十六比八十二只差六分。这时，客队换上了二点○一米的得分能手瓦尔京（四号），使身高两米左右的长人增加为三个，分数又逐渐上升。最后，客队领先十分获得胜利。
    球赛结束后，河北省副省长高树勋等人接见了双方运动员。
