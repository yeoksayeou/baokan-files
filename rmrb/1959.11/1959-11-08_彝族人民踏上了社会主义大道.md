The Yi People Embark on the Socialist Road
Wang Haimin, Secretary of the CPC Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture Committee, Deputy Governor of Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture

Since the implementation of democratic reforms in 1956, the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture has undergone tremendous changes: the area inhabited by more than 600,000 Yi people has leaped from a slave society to a socialist society. The entire prefecture completed democratic reforms in two or three years and basically achieved agricultural collectivization, establishing more than 1,100 advanced agricultural production cooperatives, with the number of households joining the cooperatives accounting for more than 88% of the total number of households. In 1958, the people's commune movement began, and the first batch of 33 pilot people's communes was established. The path that many nations in the world have taken for more than a thousand or even thousands of years has been completed here in just three years. This is a glorious victory for the Party's ethnic policy and a miracle in the history of human development.

Before liberation, the Liangshan Yi area had always maintained a slave system. This extremely barbaric and backward system seriously hindered the development of Yi society. Because the ethnic animosity and estrangement caused by the reactionary ruling classes of the past could not be eliminated all at once, the central task in the early days of liberation was to strengthen ethnic unity and create conditions for democratic reform. After a series of arduous, complex, and meticulous work, the autonomous prefecture launched a vigorous democratic reform movement in early 1956, and by early 1958, the entire prefecture had victoriously completed democratic reforms in stages and batches. From then on, the slave-owner class that had ruled Liangshan for one or two thousand years was declared eliminated, and the liberated slaves became the masters of society.

1958 was the first year of the Great Leap Forward for the people of the whole country, and it was also the year when the autonomous prefecture completed all democratic reforms. The people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture, mainly the Yi people, held high the red flag of the General Line and launched a vigorous Great Leap Forward upsurge. In just five months, the number of households joining cooperatives in the prefecture jumped from 47% of the total number of households to more than 88%, basically achieving collectivization. What is even more exciting is that the national people's commune movement attracted the broad masses as soon as it began. In the past two years of production and construction, the extensive large-scale labor cooperation between many local districts, townships, and agricultural cooperatives has made the people of the autonomous prefecture deeply realize that the large collective is stronger than the small collective, so they have requested to establish people's communes. They said with joy: "The road guided by the Party and Chairman Mao is wider and smoother, and life is getting better day by day!" In this way, the first batch of 33 pilot people's communes quickly appeared in this vast deep mountain area.

During the Great Leap Forward, the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture, relying on the strength of agricultural cooperatives and people's communes, gave full play to the productive enthusiasm that had been suppressed for thousands of years, and launched a vigorous campaign to transform nature and transform Liangshan. In the past, there was no mention of water conservancy and irrigation in Liangshan's agricultural production. However, in the two water conservancy upsurges from last spring to this spring, the prefecture mobilized 100,000 to 200,000 people, opening mountains and splitting ridges, digging ponds and building canals, expanding the irrigated area by more than 370,000 mu in one year, equivalent to more than twice the total of water conservancy construction in previous years since liberation. The agricultural cooperatives, especially the people's communes, solved many difficulties through large-scale cooperation in labor, animal power, technology, and tools, and the unified allocation of manpower. After the peasants of four townships in Butuo Dam established the people's commune, they concentrated their manpower and built two large canals with a total length of ninety li in one winter, irrigating more than 40,000 mu of farmland, which was impossible in the past. The Yi people broke many old rules and bad habits of not accumulating fertilizer, not weeding, not catching insects, and women not plowing the land, and carried out large-scale technological innovation, jumping from "slash-and-burn" to comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production. Various iron farm tools and new-style tools replaced the simple tools of the slave era, and intensive cultivation replaced extensive crop rotation. This year, the area of deep plowing of major spring crops in the prefecture reached more than one-third of the total area, and the application of fertilizer per mu generally reached more than 10,000 jin, an increase of about five times compared with last year. Major crops such as rice and corn have generally implemented reasonable close planting and the use of improved varieties. People's communes and agricultural cooperatives have built many factories and workshops and built many new roads, which has promoted the rapid development of industry and transportation in Liangshan. In the past, the Yi people had never seen factories, but this did not frighten them. When Leibo County started iron smelting, there was only one worker who could cast plowshares, but after hard study and practice, the number quickly increased to more than 130 people. Five Yi women in Jinyang County learned steelmaking technology in ten days.

In just three years, the grain output of the autonomous prefecture has more than doubled. By the end of last year, the average agricultural population of the prefecture had 800 jin of grain per person. Although the prefecture suffered various natural disasters this year, it still achieved a bumper harvest of grain, with the total output expected to increase by about 25% compared with last year, and more than triple that before liberation. The autonomous prefecture's industry started from scratch, and the first batch of industries now has more than 100 state-owned factories and mines with initial scale and more than 2,000 commune-run enterprises. Iron has been smelted for the first time, and a large number of new-style agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides have been produced. Some industrial products can already be produced locally. This year, the total industrial output value is expected to reach more than 28% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. Liangshan, which was originally closed to traffic, now has roads extending in all directions. With the development of production, the number of primary schools has increased from 80 to more than 500, and new ethnic normal schools and ethnic middle schools have been built, with more than 60,000 students enrolled. Hospitals, health centers, health stations, cultural centers, and cinemas are all over the vast urban and rural areas.

The leap forward in agriculture, the emergence and development of industry, and the tremendous improvement in the people's material and cultural life have created an unprecedentedly prosperous scene in Liangshan. In particular, the start of the people's commune movement marks that Liangshan is entering a new historical period. Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, we firmly believe that the Yi people of Liangshan will surely join the ranks of advanced nations in a short period of time and, together with the people of the whole country, march forward hand in hand and sing loudly on the socialist road.

    彝族人民踏上了社会主义大道
    中共凉山彝族自治州委员会书记  凉山彝族自治州副州长  王海民
    从1956年实行民主改革以来，凉山彝族自治州发生了巨大的变化：六十多万彝族人民的地区从奴隶社会一跃而为社会主义社会。全州在两三年内就完成了民主改革，并基本上实现了农业合作化，建立了一千一百多个高级农业生产合作社，入社农户已占总农户的88％以上；1958年，又开始了人民公社化运动，第一批试办的三十三个人民公社建成了。世界上许多民族用了一千多年甚至几千年时间所走完的路程，在这里只用了三年时间。这是党的民族政策的光辉胜利，人类发展史上的奇迹。
    解放前，凉山彝族地区一直保存着奴隶制度。这种极其野蛮、落后的制度，严重地阻碍了彝族社会的发展。由于历代反动统治阶级所造成的民族间的仇视和隔阂不可能一下子消除，因而解放初期的中心任务是加强民族团结，为民主改革创造条件。经过一系列艰巨、复杂、细致的工作，1956年初自治州开始了轰轰烈烈的民主改革运动，到1958年初全州分期分批胜利完成民主改革。从此，统治凉山一两千年的奴隶主阶级宣告消灭，解放了的奴隶成为社会的主人。
    1958年是全国人民大跃进的第一年，也是自治州民主改革全部完成的一年。自治州以彝族人民为主的各族人民，高举总路线的红旗，掀起了轰轰烈烈的大跃进高潮。短短五个月中，全州入社农户就由占总农户的47％跃增到88％以上，基本上实现了合作化。更加使人兴奋的是：全国人民公社化运动一开始就吸引了广大群众。在过去的两年生产建设中，许多地方区、乡和农业社间广泛的劳动大协作，使自治州人民深刻体会到大集体比小集体力量大，因而纷纷要求建立人民公社。他们欢欣鼓舞的说：“党和毛主席指引的道路一条比一条宽，一条比一条平，日子一天比一天好”！这样，第一批试办的三十三个人民公社，就迅速地在这个辽阔的深山里出现了。
    大跃进中，自治州各族人民依靠农业社和人民公社的力量，充分发挥了被压抑了几千年的生产积极性，干劲冲天地开展了改造自然、改造凉山的大进军。过去，凉山农业生产是谈不上什么水利灌溉的。然而，从去年春天到今年春天的两次水利高潮，全州出动十万到二十万人，开山劈岭，挖塘修渠，一年间扩大灌溉面积达三十七万多亩，相当于解放以来历年水利建设的总和两倍以上。农业社特别是人民公社在劳动力、畜力、技术、工具各方面的大协作，人力的统一调配，使许多困难迎刃而解。布拖坝上的四个乡农民在建成人民公社后，集中人力，一个冬天就修了全长九十华里的两条大水渠，灌田四万多亩，而这在过去是无法做到的。彝族人民打破了过去不积肥、不除草、不捉虫、妇女不犁地等许多陈规陋习，大搞技术革新，从“刀耕火种”一跃而进入开始全面贯彻农业生产“八字宪法”。各种铁质农具和新式工具代替了奴隶时代的简陋工具，精耕细作代替了粗放轮作。今年全州大春作物深耕面积即达总面积的三分之一以上，每亩施肥一般达一万斤以上，比去年增加约五倍。水稻、玉米等主要作物较普遍地实行了合理密植和采用良种。人民公社和农业社办了不少工厂和作坊，修了很多新的道路，推动了凉山工业和交通建设的飞速发展。过去，彝族人民从未见过工厂，但这并未吓倒他们。雷波县开始炼铁时只有一个会铸铧的工人，但经过苦学苦炼，迅速增加到一百三十多人。金阳县五个彝族妇女十天就学会了炼钢的技术。
    短短三年中，自治州粮食增产一倍多，到去年年底，全州农业人口平均每人已有粮八百斤。今年全州虽然遭受各种自然灾害，但粮食仍然获得大丰收，总产量预计将比去年增产25％左右，比解放前猛增三倍多。自治州工业白手起家，现在的第一批工业已拥有一百多座初具规模的国营厂矿，两千多社办企业。第一次炼出了铁，生产大量新式农业机具和化肥、农药。部分工业品已可就地生产。今年工业总产值预计将达工农业总产值的28％以上。原来交通闭塞的凉山，如今道路四通八达。随着生产的发展，小学由八十所发展到五百多所，并新建了民族师范和民族中学，入学人数达六万多人。医院、卫生所、保健站、文化馆、电影院遍布广大城乡。
    农业的飞跃前进，工业的出现和发展，人民物质文化生活的巨大改善，使凉山出现了一片从未有过的欣欣向荣的蓬勃景象。特别是人民公社运动的开始，标志着凉山正跨入一个新的历史时期。在党的总路线光辉照耀下，我们深信，凉山彝族人民一定会在不长的时期内，跻于先进民族的行列，和全国人民一道在社会主义大道上，并肩携手，高歌猛进。
