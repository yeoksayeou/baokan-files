Xu Peizhou Manages Grain for Ten Years
No Mold, No Loss, No Mistakes, No Insects

Xu Peizhou is a warehouse keeper at the Madian Grain Depot of the Jiaoxian Grain Bureau in Shandong. Over the past ten years, he has handled more than 43 million jin of grain and has never had any accidents such as spoilage, insect infestation, theft, or errors.

The excellent results Xu Peizhou has achieved in grain storage are inseparable from his noble character of cherishing state property and his consistent hard work. He always sweeps up and cleans up any grain spilled during loading and unloading and puts it back into the warehouse. Whether he is walking or on the grain yard, he picks up every grain he sees. Over the years, through his diligent work, he has saved the state more than 2,080 yuan. Last year, after the communization, the Jiaoxian Grain Bureau transferred 700,000 jin of high-quality wheat seeds from other places, which were stored in the open air at the Madian Grain Depot. In order to prevent any loss of the seeds, he built a temporary windbreak shed next to the wheat stacks and guarded the wheat seeds day and night, without any mistakes.

During the "Four Nos" (no rats, no insects, no mold, no accidents) grain depot campaign, some people believed that the rural conditions were not good, and the grain storage was scattered, so it was impossible to avoid problems. However, Xu Peizhou, based on his many years of practical experience, believed that it was entirely possible to achieve the "Four Nos" as long as efforts were made. Adhering to the principle of prevention over treatment, he stripped and cleaned the sorghum stalks on the roofs of the farmers' warehouses, dug out the dust from every crack, and wiped all the beams and purlins clean with prepared alkali water. Then, he dipped hot lime slurry and whitewashed the four walls. In this way, without hiring a single temporary worker, he completed the arduous task with his own hands. At the same time, he used drugs to kill and exterminate the rats. He made a small check in the warehouse every five days and a large check every ten days, solving problems immediately when they were discovered. All fifty-one locations and one hundred and thirty-one rooms of farmers' warehouses under his care were finally kept free of the "Four Nos."

    徐培州管粮十年
    不霉、不丢、不错、不生虫
    徐培州是山东胶县粮食局马店管所的保管员，十年来，他先后经手保管过四千三百多万斤粮食，从未发生霉烂变质、生虫、被盗、差错等事故。
    徐培州在粮食保管工作中所以取得了优异成绩，是与他爱护国家财产的高尚品质和一贯的辛勤劳动分不开的。每次出入库撒漏的粮食，他总是随时扫起整理干净投入仓内。他不论走路或在粮场，见到一粒粮食也要拾起来。几年来在他勤恳的劳动中，共为国家节约二千零八十余元。去年公社化以后，胶县粮食局从外地调入优良麦种七十万斤，在马店粮管所露天存放，为了不使种籽受到一点损失，他在麦垛旁边搭了个临时遮风挡风的窝棚，白天黑夜看守麦种，未发生任何差错。
    在开展四无（无鼠、无虫、无霉烂、无事故）粮仓运动中，有人认为农村条件不好，存放粮食分散，要想不发生问题办不到。徐培州却根据他多年的实践经验，认为只要努力是完全可以实现四无的。他本着防重于治的原则，把农家仓房内的屋笆的高粱秸剥净擦光，把每条缝隙的灰尘挖尽，用泡好的碱水把所有的梁檩逐根擦拭干净，然后又蘸着滚热的石灰薄浆把墙的四壁刷个洁白。就这样，没找一个临时工人，以他个人的双手完成了艰巨的任务。同时用药物把老鼠也杀净灭绝。他五天到仓内一小查，十天一大查，发现问题立即解决。他先后所保管的五十一处一百三十一间农家仓房终于全部保持了四无。
