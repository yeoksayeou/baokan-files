    Don't Forget "Good" and "Economical"
    The quality of yellow cardboard produced recently by the Suzhou Hongye Paper Mill in Jiangsu Province is very poor, and the moisture content is very high. We have to dry and flatten it before we can use it. In addition, in order to pursue output and output value, this factory is only willing to produce thicker No. 12 yellow cardboard and is unwilling to produce thinner No. 8 and No. 10 yellow cardboard. Our box factory needs a large quantity of No. 8 yellow cardboard to make boxes, but often we have to use No. 12 cardboard because this factory does not supply it. We have calculated that No. 12 paper has 3,000 sheets per ton, while No. 8 paper has more than 4,400 sheets per ton. If this factory can supply us with No. 8 paper, we can make many more boxes to meet packaging needs.
    We have raised this issue with relevant departments, but it has not been adopted. We believe that the practice of the Hongye Paper Mill does not conform to the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy.

    别忘了“好”和“省”
    江苏省苏州红叶造纸厂最近生产的黄板纸质量很差，水分很重。我们买回来非要经过晒干压平才能使用。另外，这个工厂为了追求产量和产值，只愿意生产较厚的十二号黄板纸，不愿意生产较薄的八号、十号黄板纸。我们制盒厂大量需要的八号黄板纸做纸盒，往往因为这个工厂不供应，只得采用十二号的。我们统计了一下，十二号纸每吨三千张，八号纸每吨四千四百多张，如果这个工厂能供应给我们八号纸，那我们就可多做很多盒子，满足包装需要。
    我们曾经向有关部门提过，可是一直未见采纳。我们认为红叶造纸厂这种做法是不符合增产节约精神的。
