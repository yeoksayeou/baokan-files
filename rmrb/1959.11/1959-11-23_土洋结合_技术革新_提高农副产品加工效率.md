Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 21st November: With the bumper harvest of agricultural and sideline products, Jiangxi Province has a large task of processing agricultural and sideline products this year. In order to achieve timely harvesting and processing, all regions are carrying out the processing of agricultural and sideline products while actively harvesting and collecting them.

	Gao'an County harvested 13,535,000 catties of oilseeds and 435,880,000 catties of sweet potatoes this year. At present, the county has organized 484 oil presses to start production. Xingguo County organized more than 23,000 laborers and established 2,693 seasonal agricultural product processing plants. Currently, it has processed more than 3.2 million catties of sweet potatoes, 150,000 catties of vegetables, more than 80,000 catties of fresh and dried fruits, and more than 280,000 catties of various wild plants, using various agricultural and sideline products to produce more than 230 kinds of products. The more than 20,000 catties of sugarcane that have been purchased in Qianshan County have already been processed, and more than 900,000 catties of the more than 1.4 million catties of acorns that have been purchased have already entered the factory. After all these sideline products are collected, they can meet the needs of the county's wineries this winter and next year.

	In the processing of agricultural products, all regions have adopted the method of focusing on indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods. Through technological innovation, they have created and promoted many agricultural and sideline product harvesting tools and processing tools, greatly improving harvesting and processing efficiency. Xingguo County successfully modified a foot-operated sweet potato shredding and slicing machine, which can shred 2,800 catties and slice 4,000 catties per person in eight hours, increasing work efficiency by more than ten times compared with manual operation. Linchuan County made more than 40 rice hullers and rice milling machines, basically realizing the semi-mechanization of grain processing. Grain processing alone can save 10,000 laborers and more than 7,000 rice-milling livestock.

	All regions have also actively promoted advanced experiences in oil processing, such as shelling and oil pressing, foot-operated striking, one person frying several pots, and using power, water power, and animal power to drive milling and pressing, which greatly increased the oil yield, saved labor, and reduced labor intensity.

	Henan fully utilizes state-owned and private cotton ginning machinery
Xinhua News Agency, 21st: Henan Province, in its cotton processing work, implements the policy of "walking on two legs," carries out a technological innovation movement, and improves cotton ginning efficiency. This year, the province's cotton processing volume has increased several times compared with the same period last year, but the quality of lint cotton has been greatly improved, and the impurity content of first and second grade lint cotton has been reduced from about 4% last year to about 2%.

	After the cotton was put on the market this year, Party committees and commercial departments at all levels in Henan Province, on the one hand, fully utilized the cotton ginning machines in state-owned power cotton ginning factories, and on the other hand, in accordance with the policy of "walking on two legs," organized more than 13,000 water-powered, animal-powered, and human-powered cotton ginning machines in the people's communes to undertake more than one-third of the cotton processing tasks. In organizing private cotton ginning work, they properly solved three main problems: First, organizing processing tools. In addition to making full use of existing tools, they also mobilized the masses to build small processing plants themselves by finding waste materials in every household and parts in every household. Second, helping communes establish processing professional teams, implementing the method of assigning leaders, assigning personnel, assigning tasks, assigning tools, assigning time, and assigning processing fees to organize production. Third, rationally formulating processing fee standards. All state-owned cotton ginning factories and commune processing units actively launched technological innovation activities to improve processing efficiency. (Attached picture)

    土洋结合  技术革新
    提高农副产品加工效率
    江西创造改制和推广许多加工工具
    新华社南昌21日电　随着农副产品丰收，江西省今年的农副产品加工任务很大。为了做到及时收获及时加工，各地区在积极收获和采集农副产品的同时，开展了农副产品的加工工作。
    高安县今年收获的油料达一千三百五十三万斤，红薯四亿三千五百八十万斤。现在全县已组织了四百八十四处油榨开工生产。兴国县组织了二万三千多个劳动力，建立了二千六百九十三个季节性的农产品加工厂，目前已处理红薯三百二十多万斤，蔬菜十五万斤，干鲜果八万多斤，各种野生植物二十八万多斤，用各种农副产品加工的产品达二百三十余种。铅山县已收购的二万多斤甘蔗已经进行加工，已收购的一百四十多万斤橡子有九十多万斤已经进厂。这些副产品全部收齐后，就可满足全县酒厂今冬和明年的需要。
    在农产品加工工作中，各地区都采用以土为主和土洋结合的办法，通过技术革新，创造和推广了许多农副产品的采挖工具和加工工具，大大提高了采挖和加工效率。兴国县改制成功一种脚踏的红薯刨丝、切片两用机，每人八小时可刨丝二千八百斤、切片四千斤，比手工操作提高工效十几倍。临川县制成四十多台砻谷机和碾米机，基本上实现了粮食加工半机械化，光粮食加工一项，可节约一万个劳动力和七千多头碾米的牲口。
    各地区还积极推广了油料加工方面的剥壳榨油、脚踏打撞、一人炒几锅，以及用动力、水力、畜力带碾打榨等先进经验，大大提高了出油率，节约了劳动力和减轻了劳动强度。
    河南充分利用国营和民间轧花机械
    据新华社21日讯　河南省在棉花加工工作中，贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，开展技术革新运动，提高轧花效率。今年全省棉花加工数量比去年同期成倍地增加，但皮棉的质量却大大提高，甲乙级皮棉的含杂量由去年的4％左右降低到2％左右。
    河南省各级党委和商业部门，在今年棉花上市以后，一方面开足国营动力轧花厂的轧花机，一方面根据“两条腿走路”的方针，组织人民公社的水力、畜力、人力轧花车一万三千多部，担负了三分之一以上的棉花加工任务。在组织民间轧花工作中，他们妥善地解决了三个主要问题：一是组织加工工具，除了充分利用原有工具以外，还通过家家找废料、户户找零件的办法，发动群众自己动手建设小型加工厂。二是帮助公社建立加工专业队，实行定领导、定人员、定任务、定工具、定时间、定加工费的办法，组织生产。三是合理制定加工费标准。各国营轧花厂和公社的加工单位都积极展开技术革新活动，提高了加工效率。（附图片）
