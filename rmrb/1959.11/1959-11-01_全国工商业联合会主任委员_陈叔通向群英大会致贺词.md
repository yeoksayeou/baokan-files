Xinhua News Agency, October 31st. Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, delivered a congratulatory message today at the National Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in Industry, Transportation, Basic Construction, and Finance and Trade. He first expressed his heartfelt respect to the more than six thousand heroic figures from all over the country and warmly congratulated the success of the conference. He said: A portion of specially invited representatives from industry and commerce are also participating in this solemn conference, which is an unparalleled honor given to the industrial and commercial sector by the Party and the state. Over the past ten years, under the leadership of the Party and the working class, and driven by the masses of the people, the industrial and commercial sector has achieved certain progress through self-education and self-transformation. Today, there are also representatives participating in such a grand meeting. The industrial and commercial sector sincerely thanks the great Chinese Communist Party and the great and wise people's leader, Chairman Mao, and thanks the great Chinese working class. Ten years of education from the Party have made industrialists and businessmen increasingly realize that as long as they listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow the Communist Party, take the socialist road, strengthen the fundamental transformation of their political stance, and actively serve socialism, they can certainly move closer to the working class step by step, and the future is very bright.

Chen Shutong said: The people of the whole country are all inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. There is no doubt that this conference of heroes, under the care and guidance of the Party, Chairman Mao, and other state leaders, and through the exchange of advanced experiences, mutual learning, and improvement, the heroes will raise the glorious banner of the General Line even higher with more heroic actions and bold spirit, and achieve more and greater achievements in socialist construction. Under the leadership of the Party, the hardworking and brave people of the motherland, driven by you and this conference's oath-taking, will surely push the motherland's socialist construction from one upsurge to another. "The sea is wide enough for fish to leap, and the sky is high enough for birds to fly." The people's century is precisely the era when the masses of the people use their wisdom to exert endless power. I firmly believe that in the cause of socialist construction in the motherland, old heroic generals will become redder day by day, and advanced figures will increase month by month. Countless heroic figures, together with the broad masses of the people, will converge into a giant torrent, which will surely make the socialist construction of the motherland continuously innovate and continuously leap forward.
