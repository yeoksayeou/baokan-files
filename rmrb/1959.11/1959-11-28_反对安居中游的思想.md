    Opposing the Idea of Being Content with the Middle Reaches
          The Middle Reaches are Uninhabitable
    In the surging tide of the Great Leap Forward, there are still a small number of people who do not "ride the long wind and break through the myriad waves," actively striving for the top, but instead are steady and content with staying in the middle reaches.
    It is said that the "theoretical basis" of these people is the "Doctrine of the Mean." They say: "There are always three types of people, the advanced, the middle, and the backward, and the middle is always the majority. This is the inevitable law of the development of objective things. As long as we maintain the middle reaches, we will never be separated from the majority. Although we may not be praised, we can't be considered backward."
    It seems that the proponents of the "Doctrine of the Mean" are extremely clever, but in fact, this is just a kind of wishful thinking. There is only one truth: to be advanced or to be backward; if you don't become the former, you become the latter. The "Doctrine of the Mean" is a dead end.
    It is true that there is always a distinction between the advanced, the middle, and the backward, but it is important to know that today's advanced, middle, and backward are different from yesterday's advanced, middle, and backward. Although both indicate differences, today's differences cannot be compared with yesterday's differences. Today's differences are already based on a new and higher foundation. The law of the development of objective things has proven this truth countless times: there are no isolated and static things; everything is constantly developing and changing; in motion, if it does not develop into the former, it regresses into the latter. To try to respond to all changes with invariance on the road of progress, and to always maintain the "middle reaches," is a naive fantasy. Even ancient scholars in our country recognized this truth long ago. Everyone should remember the famous saying: "Learning is like sailing against the current; if you do not advance, you will retreat." This is true in learning, in work, and in ancient times, and it is even more true in the era of the Great Leap Forward, where "one day equals twenty years."
    The "Middle Reaches Ideology" and the "Doctrine of the Mean" are actually manifestations of right-leaning conservative thinking. This kind of thinking typically reflects the ideological characteristics of small private owners. Due to their original economic base, small private owners are most likely to be content and complacent with their existing achievements, unable to see the long-term future. If the idea of "thirty acres of land, a cow, a wife and children, and a warm bed" that emerged after the land reform was a reflection of this kind of thinking in the development of the individual economy, then the current "Middle Reaches Ideology" is a manifestation of this remnant of small private owner thinking resisting the general line of socialist construction. It should be recognized that this kind of thinking is an extremely harmful germ. Whoever is infected by it will lose confidence and courage, and stagnate in their work. Obviously, it is not only a great danger to the individual, but more importantly, it is also a resistance and danger to the surging Great Leap Forward. Therefore, we must fight against the "Middle Reaches Ideology" and the "Doctrine of the Mean." (Excerpt from "Shanxi Daily" November 20th, Geng Fu: "'Being Content with the Middle Reaches' – is also a right-leaning conservative ideology")
            If You Don't Advance, You Retreat
    Some people still do not fully recognize the harmfulness of the ideology of being content with the middle reaches, saying: The upper reaches are the best, the lower reaches are the worst, and the middle reaches are neither good nor bad. The implication seems to be that the idea of being content with the middle reaches is not worthy of criticism, nor does it need to be criticized. In fact, this is not the case. The idea of being content with the middle reaches violates the spirit of the general line, and is therefore essentially opposed to the general line. The first two sentences of the general line are: Go all out, aim high, and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism. The "soul" of the general line is high speed. To achieve high speed, it is necessary to go all out and strive for the top; otherwise, high speed is unimaginable. The Party calls on us to thoroughly implement this general line in all our work and build our country into a powerful socialist country as soon as possible. But those who are content with the middle reaches lack drive, believe that the upper reaches are not worth striving for, cannot be striven for, and need not be striven for, and lack the determination and courage to strive for them. Is this not violating the spirit of the general line and therefore essentially opposing the general line?
    The development of things is absolutely unbalanced, and the state of being advanced, middle, and backward is objectively existent, but all can be changed. As long as we give full play to our subjective initiative, the middle can become advanced, the backward can catch up with the advanced, and the advanced can become even more advanced. In this way, constantly striving for the top and striving to be advanced can effectively promote the progress of things and promote social development. However, in the minds of those who are content with the middle reaches, there is a "content" mentality. They are wholeheartedly and wholeheartedly in the middle reaches, striving to maintain the status quo. Therefore, they are bound to hold an aversion and "respect but stay away" attitude towards new things that appear in the upper reaches. They live peacefully with backward things, "do not infringe on each other," and even maintain backwardness, fearing that once backwardness catches up with the advanced, they will be left behind, and being content with the middle reaches will be impossible. It can be seen from this that the ideology of being content with the middle reaches is a pillar of right-leaning opportunism, and is essentially a right-leaning ideology, which is extremely harmful to socialist construction.

### 反对安居中游的思想

    反对安居中游的思想
          中游不可居
    在汹涌澎湃的大跃进洪流中，还有这样一小部分人，不是“乘长风破万里浪”，积极主动、力争上游，而是四平八稳，甘居中游。
    据说这部分人的“理论根据”是“中庸之道”。他们说：“什么时候也有先进、中间、落后三种人，而且中间总是多数的，这是客观事物发展的必然规律，我们只要保持中游，什么时候也离不开多数人，虽得不上表扬，也算不得落后”。
    看起来“中庸之道”论者，好像聪明绝顶，其实，这不过是种得意幻想，真理只有一条：先进或者落后，不成为前者，就成为后者，“中庸之道”是走不通的。
    不错，到什么时候也有先进、中间、落后之分，但是要知道今天的先进、中间、落后与昨天的先进、中间、落后，虽然都在表明差别，但是今天的差别与昨天的差别是不能同日而语的，今天的差别，已经是在新的更高的基础上的差别了。客观事物发展的规律无数次地证明了这样一条真理，孤立静止的事物是没有的；任何事物都是不断发展变化的，在运动中不发展为前者，就倒退为后者；想在前进的道路上，以不变应万变，永远保持“中游”，是一种幼稚的幻想，这个道理，就连我国古代的学者也早就认识了，大家总该记得：“学如逆水行舟，不进则退”这句名言吧，在学习上如此，在工作上亦如此，在古代如此，在“一天等于二十年”的大跃进时代就更是如此了。
    “中游思想”与“中庸之道”实际上也是一种右倾保守思想的表现。这种思想典型的反映了小私有者的思想特点。小私有者，由于原来的经济基础，决定了他最容易抱住既得的一点点成就自满自足，看不见远大的未来，如果说土改后出现的“三十亩地一头牛，老婆娃娃热炕头”、“小康之家”思想，是这种思想在个体经济发展上的反映，那么，目前的“中游思想”就是这种小私有者的思想残余对抗社会主义建设总路线的一种表现了。应该认识，这种思想是一种危害极大的毒菌，谁沾染了它，谁就会丧失信心，失去勇气，在工作上停滞不前，显然，它不仅对个人来说是个极大的危险，而且更重要的是对汹涌澎湃的大跃进也是种阻力和危险，因此，我们就必须和“中游思想”，“中庸之道”作斗争。（摘自11月20日“山西日报”耕夫：“‘甘居中游’——也是右倾保守思想”）
            不进则退
    对于甘居中游思想的危害性，还有人认识不足，说是：上游最好，下游最坏，中游不好不坏。言下之意，似乎甘居中游的思想无可批判，也无需批判了。其实不然，甘居中游的思想，违反总路线的精神，因而实质上是反对总路线的。总路线开头两句便是：鼓足干劲，力争上游。总路线的“灵魂”是高速度。要高速度，就非得鼓足干劲，力争上游不可，否则，高速度是不可设想的。党号召我们在一切工作中彻底贯彻这条总路线，尽快地把我国建成一个强大的社会主义国家。而那些甘居中游的人，缺乏干劲，认为上游不可争，不能争，不必争，没有决心和勇气去争，这不是违反总路线的精神因而实质上是反对总路线又是什么呢？
    事物的发展，不平衡是绝对的，先进、中间和落后的状态是客观存在的，但都是能够改变的。只要充分发挥主观能动作用，中间可以变为先进，落后也能够赶上先进，而先进则更加先进。这样，不断的争上游、争先进，就能够有效地推动事物的前进，促进社会的发展。然而，在甘居中游的人的思想里有个“甘”字，他们死心塌地，全心全意居于中游，力求维持原状，因此，他们对出现在上游的新事物必然抱着厌恶的、“敬而远之”的态度。对落后的东西，他们则和平共居，“互不侵犯”，甚而维护落后，生怕一旦落后赶上先进，把他们扔在后面，甘居中游而不可得。由此可见，甘居中游的
      思想，是右倾机会主义的支柱，实质上也是一种右倾思想，对社会主义建设是极其有害的。
