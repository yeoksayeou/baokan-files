    Ignorance Combined with Rudeness
    Poem by Chi Beiou, Painting by Fang Cheng
    America once had a muddle-headed ambassador,
    Stationed in Ceylon, he couldn't name the Prime Minister of Ceylon.
    This became an international laughingstock,
    Demonstrating the arrogance and ignorance of American officials.
    This year there's an even more ridiculous oddity,
    A "grand reception" became an unprecedented act of rudeness.
    New York authorities welcomed the President of Guinea,
    But hung up the flag of the Republic of Ghana.
    American masters may think it's insignificant,
    What does it matter whether it's Guinea, Ghana, or Tunisia,
    Anyway, they are all "backward black countries,"
    Anyway, they all have large amounts of gold, iron ore, and diamonds...
    New colonialists only have the Stars and Stripes in their hearts,
    They simply don't care about the sovereignty and dignity of other countries,
    People say: Africa - a continent has stood up,
    They say: It is still the American century.
    According to a report in the American "Time" magazine, when Guinean President Touré visited New York City, the streets he passed were lined with the flag of Ghana instead of the flag of Guinea. (Attached picture)

    无知兼无礼
    池北偶诗　方成画
    美国有过一位糊涂大使，
    驻在锡兰叫不出锡兰总理的名字。
    这曾经成为国际上的笑柄，
    表明美国官员的自大和无知。
    今年还有更加可笑的怪事，
    “隆重的款待”成了破天荒的失礼。
    纽约当局欢迎几内亚总统莅临，
    却挂起了加纳共和国的国旗。
    美国老爷也许认为无伤大体，
    管它什么几内亚、加纳还是突尼斯，
    反正都是“落后的黑种人国家”，
    反正都有大量黄金、铁矿、金刚石……
    新殖民主义者心中只有星条旗，
    别国的主权和尊严根本不放在眼里，
    人们说：非洲——一个大陆已经站起来，
    他们说：现在仍然是美国的世纪。
    据美国“时代”杂志报道，当几内亚总统杜尔访问纽约市的时候，在他所经过的街道两旁却悬挂着加纳国旗，而不是几内亚国旗。（附图片）
