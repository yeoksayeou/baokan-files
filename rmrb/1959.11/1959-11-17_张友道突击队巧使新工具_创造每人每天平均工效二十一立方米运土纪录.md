Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 16th - The Su County Zhang Youdao Youth Assault Team, a red banner on the Anhui Province water conservancy front, achieved a high efficiency record of 21.2 cubic meters of earthwork per person on average on the first day of participating in the Fu Huai New River project.

On the morning of the 6th, on the two hundred-meter-long construction site responsible for the Zhang Youdao Youth Assault Team, a chorus of motor sounds, wheel rolling sounds, and labor chants resounded. Sixty-three young assault team members operated twelve sets of new water control tools all at once. Some team members pushed barrow-style trolleys that could load 0.7 cubic meters of soil at a time; some turned rope traction machines to pull wooden boxes along overhead tracks to transport soil; and some pushed light wheelbarrow-style soil transport vehicles to send the soil dozens of meters away. The entire construction site adopted advanced tools, and no one was carrying loads. The famous farmer inventor Gong Peizhi focused on operating the powered aerial cableway that he had recently created in cooperation with Zhang Youdao. Although this was only the first day of testing and the overhead track, built overnight, was not ideal, it still created a high record of an average daily efficiency of 40.2 cubic meters. This kind of cableway only needs a 3.5-horsepower small gas engine to drive it. One person can move the "soil clutch" to make the soil-filled carriage run along the track and automatically dump the soil. This is a great leap forward compared to using a rope traction machine to transport soil. On this day, the labor order on the construction site was orderly, breaking the usual "three days of chaos at the start of construction." Each assault team member acted in close coordination according to the work assigned in advance.

The Zhang Youdao Youth Assault Team has a ten-year history of participating in water control and has won the title of advanced collective eighteen times. Since the winter of 1957, the entire team has manufactured and promoted more than ten types of advanced tools. In addition to having a high degree of socialist consciousness and a spirit of bold innovation, they have accumulated rich construction experience over the past ten years. The main experiences are: (1) To understand the details of the project before starting construction and make an overall plan. According to the length of the construction section, the width of the position, the degree of climbing and digging depth, the distance of soil transportation, the difficulty of digging soil, etc., a construction plan should be made, a work efficiency target should be set every day, and labor and tools should be allocated well. The plan should be flexibly changed with the progress of the project, so that there is no confusion and the order on the construction site is in order. (2) Not only boldly adopt a single advanced water control tool, but also implement collaboration, and use advanced tools in all links to improve the efficiency of loading, transporting, and unloading soil. Under suitable conditions, blasting and loosening soil is also adopted to solve the difficulty of low efficiency of manual excavation. (3) Scientifically arrange labor organization to make the best use of talents and avoid idle work. The team members have both division of labor and collaboration, both expertise and skills to operate more than six kinds of tools.

This year, in the construction, the Zhang Youdao Youth Assault Team has created and modified six kinds of advanced water control tools, which have initially shown their edge on the first day of construction. At present, all team members are in high spirits and are studying the creation of "soil combines" and powered barrow-style trolleys that can dig and transport soil at the same time.

### 张友道突击队巧使新工具  创造每人每天平均工效二十一立方米运土纪录

    张友道突击队巧使新工具
    创造每人每天平均工效二十一立方米运土纪录
    新华社合肥16日电　安徽省治水战线上的一面红旗——宿县张友道青年突击队，在参加符怀新河工程的第一天，获得了每人平均作土方二十一点二立方米的高工效纪录。
    6日早晨，张友道青年突击队负责的二百多米长的工地上，响起了一片马达声、车轮滚动声和劳动号子声，六十三个青年突击队员，操纵着十二套新式治水工具一齐出动，有的队员推着一次就能装土零点七立方米的簸箕式滑车；有的转动着绳索牵引机，牵引木箱沿着架空轨道送土；有的推着轻便的黄包车式送土车，把土送出几十米以外。整个工地，都采用了先进工具，没有一个挑抬的。著名的农民创造发明家龚培芝，聚精会神地操纵着他新近和张友道合作创制的动力空中滑车，尽管这还是第一天试车，连夜赶搭起的空中轨道还不够理想，但这一天仍创造了每天平均工效四十点二立方米的高额纪录。这种滑车只用三点五马力的小煤气机就能带动，一个人扳动着“土离合器”，就能叫装土的车厢顺着轨道奔跑，自动倒土，它比用绳索牵引机运土又大大跃进了一步。这一天，工地上劳动秩序井然，打破了“开工三天乱”的常规。每个突击队员都按照事前分配好的工种，紧密协同动作。
    张友道青年突击队参加治水已有十年的历史，先后曾十八次荣获先进集体称号。从1957年冬季以来，全队制造和推广先进工具达十多种。他们除了具有高度的社会主义觉悟和大胆革新的精神以外，十年来积累了丰富的施工经验，这些主要经验是：（一）开工前摸清工程底细，通盘计划。根据工段长短、阵地宽窄、爬高挖深程度，运土距离远近、挖土难易等情况，作好施工计划，每天订出工效目标，配备好劳力、工具，随着工程进展而灵活变动，做到不打糊涂仗，工地秩序有条不紊。（二）不但大胆采用单一的先进治水工具，并且实行协作，在各个环节上都使用先进工具，提高了装土、运土、卸土的工效。在适宜的条件下，还采取爆破松土法，解决了人力挖土效率低的困难。（三）科学地安排劳动组织，做到人尽其才，不窝工。队员们既有分工、又有协作，既有专长、又有操作六种以上工具的技能。
    今年施工中，张友道青年突击队又创制和改制了六种先进治水工具，在施工的第一天就初露了锋芒。目前全体队员斗志昂扬，正在研究创制能同时挖土、运土的“土康拜因”和动力簸箕式滑车。
