The Harbin Boiler Factory, like all fraternal factories across the country, has experienced a great practice over the past two years. In 1958, the total output value of the boiler factory was 4.8 times that of 1957, and the total output value from January to September 1959 was 1.7 times that of the same period last year. Especially after studying and implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the enlarged meeting of the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees, and after examining and criticizing the right-leaning conservative thinking of a few cadres, all the factory's workers were greatly encouraged. They fought hard in August and September, completing this year's boiler production task 100 days ahead of schedule and completing the Second Five-Year Plan, that is, the electric station boiler target undertaken by the factory in 1962, 3 years and 100 days ahead of schedule. In the past two years, this factory has produced a total of 218 new products urgently needed for the development of the national economy, such as boilers, high and medium pressure chemical containers, and petroleum equipment, supporting the construction of the power, chemical, and petroleum industries in 18 provinces and two autonomous regions across the country. It has also begun to provide technical equipment for the socialist construction of fraternal countries, and independently designed a series of medium-pressure boilers. The technical strength has been greatly developed and improved, and it has begun to move from imitation to a new stage of independent design and manufacture.

The main reason why the Harbin Boiler Factory was able to master new technologies so quickly is that they adopted the method of following the mass line, mobilizing everyone to learn humbly, create boldly, and actively promote advanced experiences.

Boilers are products produced in small individual batches, characterized by large size, many parts, complex technology, long production cycles, and absolutely reliable quality requirements for large-scale linkage units. When this factory was still carrying out large-scale capital construction in 1955, the factory's Party Committee considered that after the factory was completed, the urgent task was to quickly master new production technologies and produce boilers in a faster, better, and more economical way. In order to achieve this goal as soon as possible, during the entire trial production process, they mobilized the masses to humbly learn from the Soviet experience, and with the help of Soviet experts, compiled 146 key processes, and repeatedly conducted a major military exercise for more than half a year for all factory employees in the form of lectures. Therefore, it took only four months to master the world's most advanced electroslag welding technology. Within a year and a half of starting production, they fully mastered the manufacturing technology of medium-pressure boilers, and on this basis, successfully trial-produced high-temperature and high-pressure boilers, breaking through the design targets in terms of quantity and variety (the design stipulated that only medium-pressure boilers should be produced).

Through production practice, their understanding of the technical data provided by foreign countries has gradually transitioned from "blindly imitating" to "thoroughly understanding" and combining with China's actual conditions to "bring forth new ideas" in independent design. For example, China has good coal quality, large climatic differences between the north and south, and relatively few high-grade alloy steels at present. They redesigned the medium-pressure boiler with an evaporation capacity of 75 tons per hour. This boiler saves about 50 tons of various steels and does not use any alloy steel. After trial operation, the product quality has proven to be fully qualified. Through the exercise of designing this 75-ton boiler, they further designed medium-pressure boilers and high-pressure boilers with greater evaporation capacity.

These boilers were designed jointly by organizing technicians and workers using the "three-in-one" method. Designers brought general drawings to the workshop, provided technical briefings to the workers in a serious manner, explained the design structure, and technicians also participated in labor, while workers participated in structural improvements and parts design. In this way, it took only two months to design and manufacture a 280-ton medium-pressure boiler. In this mass movement, workers, based on their personal experience, put forward modification suggestions to the design, improved the structure of the cyclone separator, and corrected the shortcomings in the design structure of the water-cooled wall. Technicians also helped workers improve their technical knowledge, gradually changing the workers' situation of knowing what is happening but not why it is happening, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the workers for technical innovation and technical revolution, and improving the relationship between technicians and workers. The "three-in-one" work team is a good way to carry out mass movements in technical work and conduct technical innovations. Leading cadres promptly put forward key production points, provided technical innovators with ideological and material assistance, and workers and technicians learned from each other and discussed together, which could play a "mutually beneficial" effect. Many welding problems in this factory have been solved by using this method.

In addition to the new advanced experiences created by the Harbin Boiler Factory itself, it also vigorously promoted advanced experiences from home and abroad. Since the beginning of this year, they have promoted a total of 367 advanced experiences from domestic and foreign sources and within and outside the factory, all of which have produced huge effects on production. For example, after promoting Liang Yande's non-electrode head welding method to all welders in the factory, a large number of welding rods were saved. After promoting the push-turn cutter from the First Tool Factory, the key problem of un-smooth processing of tube sheet holes was solved. The experience of the Harbin Boiler Factory proves that adopting large-scale publicity, large-scale performances, and organizing visits and discussions is a good way to promote advanced experience. In the first half of this year, the factory used the "three-in-one" method to organize eight visiting groups to visit and study in Shanghai, Dalian, and other places. It also visited users and held discussions with power station installation and operation personnel to solicit their opinions on the products, which also had a good effect on improving product quality. Within the factory, they organized several large-scale technical performances, such as the technical performance of Liang Yande's advanced experience, in which more than 700 people participated, and his advanced welding method was quickly promoted throughout the factory. After the Harbin Municipal Industrial Production Advanced Experience Observation Group came to the factory to observe and guide, the casting workshop held a technical performance meeting, and the workers' technical level was greatly improved, and the scrap rate dropped from the original 20% to 7% to 8%. In addition, they also published special publications such as "News Flash," "Technical Translations," and "Technical Bulletins" to report on technical innovations and promote advanced experiences inside and outside the factory and at home and abroad, constantly improving the technical level of employees.

In order to make advanced experience take root in production, they regarded the work of promoting advanced experience as an important part of the factory's production technology management work, and identified and consolidated each successful item. The major projects in the advanced experience that need to be promoted and the new technologies that need to be mastered are included in the factory's technical organization measures plan as part of the factory's unified mastery plan, and various positive factors are mobilized to achieve it. For innovations in process aspects, they use the method of revising the process regulations to consolidate it. For aspects of tools and equipment, it is included in the process equipment. For design aspects, it is consolidated by revising drawings. For items that do not fall into these categories, such as "nested cutting," they are consolidated by summarizing in writing and making resolutions. In this way, they have effectively achieved "one flower blooms and one fruit bears," "everything is accounted for, and everything has a landing place."

Now, on the basis of completing the Second Five-Year Plan 3 years and 100 days ahead of schedule and completing the annual boiler production task 100 days ahead of schedule, the Harbin Boiler Factory is striving to complete the new production increase and economy plan for the fourth quarter of this year one month ahead of schedule, and at the same time, organizing forces to carry out various preparations for the great leap forward in 1960.

    群策群力学习技术提高技术
    哈尔滨锅炉厂运用群众路线的办法掌握新技术
    哈尔滨锅炉厂像全国各兄弟厂一样，两年来经历了一个伟大的实践。1958年，锅炉厂总产值为1957年的四点八倍，1959年1至9月份的总产值为去年同期的一点七倍。特别是在学习和贯彻了党的八届八中全会和省市委扩大会议的精神以后，检查和批判了少数干部中的右倾保守思想，全厂职工受到了极大鼓舞，大战8、9两个月，提前一百天完成了今年的锅炉生产任务，提前三年零一百天完成了第二个五年计划，即1962年工厂承担的电站锅炉指标任务。这个厂两年来共生产了二百一十八种发展国民经济迫切需要的新产品，如锅炉、高中压化工容器、石油设备等，支援了全国十八个省两个自治区的电力、化学和石油工业的建设，也开始为兄弟国家的社会主义建设提供技术装备，并独立设计了系列化的中压锅炉，技术力量有很大的发展和提高，已由仿造开始走上了独立设计制造的新阶段。
    哈尔滨锅炉厂所以能够这样迅速地掌握了新技术，主要是由于他们采取走群众路线的办法，发动大家虚心学习，大胆创造，积极推广先进经验。
    锅炉是单个小批生产的产品，特点是体积大零件多，技术复杂，生产周期长，质量要求绝对可靠的大型连动机组。当这个厂还在1955年大规模进行基本建设时期，工厂党委就考虑到在工厂建成后，紧迫的任务是如何迅速地掌握新的生产技术，多快好省地生产锅炉。为了尽快地达到这一目的，他们在整个试生产过程中，发动群众虚心地学习苏联的经验，并在苏联专家的帮助下，编制了一百四十六项关键工艺，以讲课方式对全厂职工反复地进行了半年多的大练兵。因此，只用四个月的时间就掌握了世界上最先进的电渣焊接技术，在开工生产一年多的时间内就全部掌握了中压锅炉的制造技术，并在此基础上试制成功了高温高压锅炉，从数量上品种上都突破了设计指标（设计规定只生产中压锅炉）。
    经过生产的实践，他们对国外供应的技术资料已经由“照猫画虎”的仿造逐步进入到“融会贯通”和结合中国实际情况“推陈出新”独立设计的阶段。例如，我国煤质好，东西南北气候差别大，目前高级合金钢材还比较少。他们就重新设计了每小时蒸发量七十五吨的中压锅炉。这台锅炉节省了各种钢材约五十吨，全部不用合金钢。经过试行运转，证明产品质量完全合格。通过这台七十五吨锅炉设计的锻炼，他们又进一步设计了蒸发量更大的中压锅炉和高压锅炉。
    这些锅炉是用三结合的方法组织技术人员和工人共同设计的。设计人员带总图下车间，向工人认真地进行了技术交底，解释设计结构，技术人员同时参加劳动，工人参加结构改进和零件设计。这样，仅用了两个月的时间，就设计制造了一台二百八十吨的中压锅炉。在这一群众运动中，工人根据切身的体验，对设计提出了修改意见，改进了旋风分离器的结构，纠正了水冷壁设计结构上的缺点；技术人员也帮助工人提高了技术知识，逐步地改变了工人们知其然不知其所以然的境地，大大地鼓舞了职工群众对技术革新和技术革命的热情，改善了技术人员和工人的关系。三结合的工作队是技术工作中大搞群众运动进行技术革新的好办法。领导干部及时提出生产关键，给与技术革新者以思想上、物质上的帮助，而工人和技术人员相互学习共同讨论，能够发挥“相得益彰”的效果。这个厂许多焊接工作的难题都是运用这个方法解决的。
    哈尔滨锅炉厂除了自己创造的新的先进经验外，还大力推广了国内外的先进经验。今年以来，他们共推广了三百六十七项国内外、厂内外的先进经验，在生产上都产生了巨大的效果。如向全厂电焊工推广了梁彦德的无焊条头焊接法以后，节约了大量焊条；推广了第一工具厂的推转刀以后，解决了管板孔加工不光的关键。哈尔滨锅炉厂的经验证明，采取大宣传、大表演、组织参观座谈是推广先进经验的一种好方法。今年上半年这个厂用三结合的办法，先后组织了八个参观团到上海、大连等地去参观学习，还通过访问用户和召开电站安装运转人员座谈，征求他们对产品的意见，对改进产品质量也都收到了良好效果。在厂内，他们组织了几次大规模的技术表演，如梁彦德先进经验技术表演，有七百多人参加，他的先进焊接法很快就推广到全厂。铸工车间在哈尔滨市工业生产先进经验观摩团来厂观摩指导后，举行了一次技术表演会，工人的技术水平大为提高，废品率从原来20％降低到7％到8％。另外，他们还专门出版了报道技术革新和推广先进经验的“消息快报”、“技术译丛”、“技术通报”等刊物，及时地报道工厂内外和国内外的先进经验，不断地提高了职工的技术水平。
    为了使先进经验在生产中扎根，他们把推广先进经验的工作作为工厂生产技术管理工作的重要组成部分，成功一项就鉴定一项、巩固一项。把需要推广的先进经验和需要掌握的新技术中的重大项目，列入工厂技术组织措施计划中去，作为工厂统一掌握计划中的一部分，调动各种积极因素来实现它。属于工艺方面的革新，他们就用修改工艺规程的方法来巩固它；属于工具设备方面的，就列入工艺装备中；属于设计方面的，就用修改图纸来巩固它。不属于这些范围内，如“套裁下料”等，就用书面总结的办法，作出决议去巩固它。这样就切实地做到了“开一朵花结一个果”，“事事有交待，件件有着落”。
    现在，哈尔滨锅炉厂正在提前三年零一百天完成第二个五年计划和提前一百天完成全年锅炉生产任务的基础上，力争提前一个月完成今年第四季度新的增产节约计划，同时组织力量为1960年的大跃进展开了各方面的准备工作。
