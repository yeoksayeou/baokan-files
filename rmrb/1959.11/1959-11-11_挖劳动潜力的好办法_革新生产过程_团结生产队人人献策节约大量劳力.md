Unite the Production Team Everyone Offers Suggestions to Save a Lot of Labor

    (Our report) The Tuanjie (Unity) Production Team of the Kongtong People's Commune in Pingliang City, Gansu Province, carried out nine production reforms, saving a lot of labor and animal power.

    After the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced, the Party organization of the Tuanjie Production Brigade launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy among the commune members. At first, everyone felt that there was nowhere to start, and some people understood increasing production and practicing economy as simply saving on food and clothing. Wang Tianlu, the secretary of the general branch, kept thinking: How to guide this movement to production? He found Wang Ming, an old farmer, and asked him: "What aspects of our production are unreasonable, and how can we improve them?" Wang Ming replied casually: "In my opinion, don't mix soil when accumulating fertilizer, but transport pure manure up the mountain, which can save labor." Wang Tianlu was inspired and thought: That makes sense, there is a lot to be done here. After discussion by the general branch committee, it was decided to mobilize the masses, everyone would contribute ideas and suggestions, and reform the unreasonable phenomena in the production process.

    Since mid-September, a mass upsurge of reforming the production process in conjunction with current production has formed. People reform as they produce, reforming whatever they do.

    In the process of production renovation, the entire brigade put forward 140 rationalization proposals, which the Party organization summarized into nine items: ① People and animals carry fertilizer on the way to the fields, and carry crops on the way home, avoiding empty trips. The implementation of this method saves more than 3,000 labor days and more than 1,800 animal labor days per month. ② Pure manure is transported to the mountains. Some of the mountainous land in the Liao Family Village, Ren Family Village, and Wang Family Ping production teams is three or four miles away from the village. At that time, it was also the autumn sowing season, so the commune members made and reformed as they went, implementing the method of transporting pure manure to the mountains, saving a large amount of labor. ③ Livestock pens are moved to the mountains. Nine cave dwellings were dug on the mountains, and 250 sheep and 24 cattle were driven up the mountains to be raised in pens. These livestock have now accumulated more than 4 million catties of fertilizer, which can provide fertilizer for 1,000 acres of mountainous land. This reform alone saves 10,000 labor days and 20,000 animal labor days. ④ Threshing grounds are set up on the mountain fields for on-site threshing. Most of the commune members of the Tuanjie Brigade live at the foot of the mountains and in the river valleys, but most of the cultivated land is on the mountains. During the harvest season, crops have to be transported from the mountains to the foot of the mountains, and fertilizer has to be transported from the foot of the mountains to the mountains, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Now, threshing is done on-site, and only grain is transported down the mountains. This item alone can save 6,500 man-days and 4,200 animal labor days during this year's autumn harvest. ⑤ Adjust the cultivation areas after negotiation between the teams according to living conditions. The cultivation layout of the five production teams in the entire brigade is very unreasonable. For example, the Wang Family Mill team has more than 200 acres of land nearby, only half a mile away from the team, but it is cultivated by the Street Team, which is more than a mile away. After consultation and adjustment, it is cultivated by the Wang Family Mill team, which can save more than 420 labor days a year from planting to harvesting. ⑥ Straighten bends and plan field roads. The brigade plans to build three field roads after the autumn harvest. Preliminary calculations show that this year, due to less walking, more than 800 labor days and animal labor days can be saved. ⑦ Establish remote farming stations. The Ren Family Village production team has more than 690 acres of land on the mountains three to five miles away, and 340 acres of land on the mountains five to fifteen miles away. A lot of time is wasted on walking. The brigade plans to dig nine cave dwellings on the mountains as farming points. During the busy season, people bring tools and livestock to the mountains to stay and cultivate. ⑧ Dig water wells next to the livestock pens. The entire team has eleven breeding rooms, and one well is dug in each room, which can save labor in carrying water and driving livestock to the river ditches for drinking water. ⑨ The livestock pens of this brigade only have one large gate. Each time manure is taken from the pens, it has to be entered and exited through the gate, which is very inconvenient. Now, a back door is opened next to the pen, one for entry and one for exit, greatly improving labor efficiency. In this way, more than a dozen laborers can be saved each time manure is removed from the pen.

    The implementation of these reforms by the Tuanjie Brigade has freed up a large amount of labor and animal power to be directly invested in agricultural and sideline production, which has created favorable conditions for a greater agricultural harvest next year.

    挖劳动潜力的好办法
    革新生产过程
    团结生产队人人献策节约大量劳力
    本报讯　甘肃平凉市崆峒人民公社团结生产队进行九项生产改革，节省大量的劳畜力。
    党的八届八中全会决议公布后，团结生产大队党组织在社员中开展了增产节约运动。开始，大家都感到没处下手，好些人把增产节约理解成只是生活上的省吃俭用。总支书记王田禄在脑子里打圈圈：怎样把这个运动引导到生产上去？他找到了老农王明，问他：“咱们生产上还有那些地方不合理，怎样改进？”王明顺口回答：“依我看，积肥时不要掺土，把纯粪运上山，这样可以节省劳力。”王田禄受到启发，他想：有道理，这里面大有文章。经过总支委员会的讨论，决定发动群众，人人献计献策，改革生产过程中不合理的现象。
    9月中下旬以来，一个结合当前生产的群众性改革生产过程的高潮形成了。人们边生产，边改革，做什么，改什么。
    在革新生产的过程中，全大队提出了一百四十条合理化建议，党组织归纳成为九项：①人畜上地捎肥，回家捎庄稼，来回不空走。实行这项办法，一个月节省劳动日三千多个，畜工一千八百多个。②纯粪上山。廖家庄、任家庄、王家坪等生产小队部分山地离村庄有三、四里路远，当时又正赶上秋种，社员们就边做边改，实行纯粪上山办法，节省了大批劳力。③畜圈上山。在山上挖了九孔窑洞，二百五十只羊和二十四头牛赶上山圈养，这些牲畜到现在已积肥四百多万斤，可供一千亩山地施肥。仅这一项改革，就节省劳动日一万个，畜工二万个。④在山地上就地设场，就地打碾。团结大队社员多住在山下和川里，但大部分耕地在山上，收获季节要从山上往山下运庄稼，又从山下往山上运肥料，路远费工，现在就地打碾，只运粮下山。这一项在今年秋收中，就能节省人工六千五百个，畜工四千二百个。⑤按照居住条件，经过小队之间协商，调整耕作区。全大队五个生产小队，耕作布局很不合理。如王家磨小队附近有二百多亩地，离本队只有半里路，却归一里路以外的街道队耕种；协商调整后，归王家磨队种，从种到收，一年就可节省劳动力四百二十多个。⑥裁弯取直，规划田间道路。大队计划秋收后，修田间道路三条，初步计算今年因少走路，可节省劳动日和畜工八百多个。⑦建立远地耕作站。任家庄生产队有六百九十多亩地在三至五里以外的山上，三百四十亩地在五至十五里左右的山上，很多时间消耗在走路上。大队计划在山上打九孔窑洞，作为耕作点，生产紧张季节，人带上工具和牲口，上山住宿耕种。⑧畜圈旁边打水井。全队十一个饲养室，一室打一井，可以节省担水和赶牲口到河渠边饮水的劳力。⑨这个大队牲畜圈棚只有一个大门，每次从圈中起粪，要从大门出进，出出进进很不方便。现在在圈棚旁边开一个后门，一个进门，一个出门，劳动效率大大提高。这样，每出一次圈粪，就可节省劳力十几个。
    团结大队实行了这些改革，就腾出了大批劳畜力直接投入农副业生产，这为明年农业更大丰收创造了良好条件。
