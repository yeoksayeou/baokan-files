    The Spirit of Communism
    — Commemorating the 20th Anniversary of Dr. Bethune's Death
    Zhou Erfu

    Twenty years ago this morning, Dr. Bethune, in the village of Huangshikou, Wanxian County, in the Anti-Japanese Base Area of ​​Jin-Cha-Ji, handed his written will to his translator. A revolutionary, optimistic smile appeared on his bearded face as he earnestly told the translator:
    "Work hard! Towards the great road, open up the cause ahead!"
    He breathed his last, leaving behind a great unfinished cause.

    Twenty years have passed quickly. For twenty years, we have often missed Dr. Bethune. His every move seems to be right before us, as if he is advancing along with the revolutionary ranks. Mentioning his brilliant name immediately inspires respect, admiration, excitement, courage, and progress.

    He was down-to-earth in his work and full of energy. As soon as he arrived at the Health Department of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, he examined more than 520 sick and wounded soldiers in the first week. In the second week, he began performing surgeries continuously for four weeks. After 147 sick and wounded soldiers had surgery performed by him, they returned to the front line. After a long and tiring march, when he arrived at a health department or hospital, the first thing he cared about was where the sick and wounded soldiers were staying, and he wanted to see them. If the responsible comrade asked him to rest first, he always said: "I am here to work, not to rest." He always had a plan before doing any work; after the work was completed, there was a summary report. What he said, he must do, truly as the Chinese say, "words must be followed by actions, and actions must bear fruit." He was not an empty talker. He said: "Empty talk cannot replace action. Words are invented to describe action. Use them as they were originally intended!"

    He was never satisfied with existing achievements and always wanted to improve the treatment tools, improve the environment, and increase work efficiency. When he first arrived in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, he established a regular model hospital; shortly after its establishment, it encountered a counter-sweep, and the enemy destroyed his hard work. He then changed to establishing small-scale hospitals based in the homes of ordinary people. The same was true in terms of carrying treatment equipment. Initially, he wanted to bring a full set of equipment, and one move involved more than a dozen pack animals, which was not suitable for the frequent warfare behind enemy lines. As soon as he arrived in Ji-Zhong, he immediately changed to light equipment. When performing surgery, he used a saw to cut off the thigh, often taking flesh with it. He tried to make a kidney-shaped wooden board to separate the bone and flesh. Some people emphasized the difficulties behind enemy lines, the difficulty in carrying out work, and even attributed the shortcomings of work to objective conditions. However, he found ways to do the work well and improve efficiency under difficult conditions.

    He was upright and selfless. Every move he made was entirely for the revolutionary work, for serving the people, and never for his own sake. When he arrived at the health department of a military sub-district and found that the patients had no quilts, he severely criticized the health workers and insisted on giving his own and the workers' quilts to the sick and wounded soldiers first. He found that a wounded soldier was about to have his leg cut off because he had not been splinted, and repeatedly questioned the doctor, demanding that he be punished and reported to his superiors. He said, "It is impossible to do health work without being so strict and serious. We must be unceremoniously critical and ruthless towards personal vanity." The health workers under his leadership developed such a serious and upright style and principled spirit, and everyone supervised each other. Chairman Mao said: "We must all learn from his spirit of utter selflessness. Starting from this point, one can become a person who is greatly beneficial to the people. A person's ability may be great or small, but as long as one has this spirit, one is a noble person, a pure person, and a moral person." Dr. Bethune was such a noble person.

    He was not afraid of difficulties. Difficulties bow down before the great courage and wisdom of heroes. Any difficult work, as long as it was beneficial to the sick and wounded soldiers, he would do it regardless of everything. When he was in Ji-Zhong, he heard that there were sick and wounded soldiers in the guerrilla area, only ten or twenty li away from the enemy's stronghold, and the enemy could surround these villages at any time, and he still wanted to go. After he went to treat the sick and wounded soldiers, the village was indeed surrounded. If it were not for the strict organization of the soldiers and civilians, he would have really been taken prisoner in a matter of minutes. But he was calm and composed, thinking that it was the greatest joy of his life that the sick and wounded soldiers in the guerrilla area far in the enemy's encirclement could receive his treatment! What a noble style!

    His life was arduous and simple. A doctor who grew up in the upper class of capitalist society, and who was one of the world's leading experts, a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, his past standard of living can be imagined. It was already not easy for him to come to wartime China, let alone behind enemy lines, and even more so in the poor mountains and rivers of western Hebei, but he thought that the happiest days of his life were spent in this area. He wore the cloth clothes of the Eighth Route Army, the straw sandals of the Eighth Route Army, and ate the simple meals of the Eighth Route Army. The military region specially gave him a cook to take care of his living habits, and his food expenses could be reimbursed. But he demanded the same life as the Eighth Route Army soldiers. If the cook made him a slightly better meal, he would immediately be blamed. Even when the responsible comrade held a banquet for him, he said: "I feel uncomfortable that you treat me as a guest and have prepared so many dishes, which is too wasteful."

    He readily accepted good advice and had a high degree of self-criticism. He was good at criticizing others, and he was also good at criticizing himself. In the face of truth, there is no distinction between you and me, only right and wrong. He often said: "If there is anything wrong with me, I hope you will criticize me, and I will correct it 100% in my work." Once in Ji-Zhong, due to three consecutive days and nights of surgery, the tense and busy work made him irritable. He found everything displeasing and was dissatisfied with everyone, and lost his temper. His translator had never quarreled with him before, but this time they actually quarreled. Afterwards, he reviewed to the translator: "Don't blame me, I am really too tired. I have a bad temper, please forgive me." He did not have a good understanding of the medical director introduced by General Wang Zhen. Later, he discovered his mistake in work and study, so he immediately wrote a letter to General Wang Zhen: "In the past, my understanding of ××× was wrong. Your understanding of him is correct. He can still work and study. As long as he works hard, it is possible to become a good surgeon. Now, I admit my mistake to you."

    He was tireless in teaching and helping others to progress together. He always wanted to impart his skills and knowledge to others as much as possible and help others. After seeing the patients every day, he would also give lessons to the medical staff, but there were no textbooks. A blackboard was considered everyone's textbook. He wrote, drew, and lectured on it. After being tired all day, in the evening, he would write an illustrated manual specially for doctors and nurses under the lamp. In order to improve the skills of the medical personnel in the border area, he established model hospitals and special surgical hospitals, and transferred representatives from various regions to practice, and then taught others when they returned. After working in Ji-Zhong for a period of time, he had rich experience in field treatment, and as soon as he returned to the western Hebei mountains, he began to write a book on this aspect. He never kept what he knew a secret, but was thinking about how to tell others and help others improve to an advanced level.

    More importantly, it is his noble proletarian quality of selflessness. He said: "What are the responsibilities of a doctor, a nurse, and a clerk? There is only one responsibility. That is to make your patient happy, help him recover his health, and restore his strength. You must regard each of them as your brother, your father—because in truth, yes, they are more kind than brothers and parents, he is your comrade. In everything, put him first." At the most dangerous time, at the time of life and death, it is easiest to see a person's character. This is the touchstone. At this time, Dr. Bethune's first consideration was not his own safety, but the survival of the sick and wounded soldiers. On the front line of Ji-Zhong, his aid station was bombarded by artillery fire, but he remained calm and continued to rescue the wounded. In the small temple near Wang Anzhen in western Hebei, he was surrounded by the enemy at that time, and the enemy was about to arrive. In order to rescue the wounded, he refused to leave. The wounded even hoped that their own sacrifice would not matter, and wanted him to leave, but he refused to leave. He estimated that he could rush to finish the surgery, and at the greatest risk to his life, he finally finished the surgery before leaving. He said, "The sooner the wounded are treated, the better. Early treatment can reduce the suffering of the wounded and reduce the death of the wounded." Finally, in order to rush to treat a wounded soldier's head injury, he forgot to wear rubber gloves in a hurry when performing the surgery. His middle finger was originally injured by a knife. At this time, the bacteria in the wounded's wound secretly entered his wound, causing him to be infected, and the condition gradually deteriorated. Finally, his own precious life was dedicated to the wounded soldiers and to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat.

    Why was Dr. Bethune able to be so selfless? Because he was an ordinary person, but also a special person. An ordinary person, he lived among the people and served the people honestly; at the same time, he was a Communist Party member, a special person, a person with the most noble qualities, a brilliant fighter of the proletariat, without the slightest desire for selfishness, his only desire was to serve the people's revolutionary cause, and to serve without cost, without conditions, to serve the Canadian people, to serve the Chinese people, to serve the working people of the world, giving his all until his death. Only a Communist Party member can have such noble qualities, and only a Communist Party member can have such a broad mind and internationalist spirit. This is what Chairman Mao said: "A foreigner, without any selfish motives, regards the cause of liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause. What kind of spirit is this? This is the spirit of internationalism, this is the spirit of communism. Every Chinese Communist Party member should learn this spirit."

    Although Dr. Bethune has passed away for twenty years, has he ever left us? With the expansion of the revolutionary ranks and the development of the revolutionary cause, thousands upon thousands of fighters shining with communist brilliance are constantly emerging in our advancing ranks. Relying on them and the people, under the leadership of the Party, we have won the victory of the Chinese revolution, and now we are constantly achieving great victories in socialist construction. Isn't the heroic achievements reported by the heroes at the recent National Congress of Heroes a vivid illustration of this fact? And a person with the spirit of communism will always live among the people, opening up the great cause of socialism and communism towards the great road!

    共产主义的精神
    ——纪念白求恩大夫逝世二十周年
    周而复
    二十年前的今天早晨，白求恩大夫在晋察冀抗日根据地完县黄石口村子里，把写好了的遗嘱交给他的翻译，满是胡髭的脸上浮起革命的乐观的微笑，谆谆地对翻译说：
    “努力吧！向着伟大的道路，开辟前面的事业！”
    他吐出了最后一口气，留下了伟大的未完的事业。
    二十年很快地过去了。二十年来，我们常常怀念白求恩大夫。他的一举一动，恍如就在目前，仿佛他随着革命的行列一道前进。一提起他的光辉的名字，马上就使人尊敬，使人仰慕，使人兴奋，使人勇敢，使人前进。
    他工作踏实，干劲冲天。他一到晋察冀军区卫生部，第一周就检查了五百二十多个伤病员；第二周开始连续作了四个星期的手术。一百四十七个伤病员在他施行手术后，又到前线去了。在他经过长途疲劳行军之后，到达一个卫生部或者医院，一走进门，首先关心的是伤病员住在什么地方，要去看他们。负责同志如果请他先休息一下，他总是说：“我是来工作的，不是来休息的。”他每做一件工作，事先总有个计划；工作完成，就有个总结报告。他说出的话，一定要做到，真正如中国所谓的“言必行，行必果”。他不是空谈家。他说：“空谈代替不了行动，话是人们发明来描写行动的，照它底本来面目去用它吧！”
    他永远不满足于已有的成就，总想把治疗工具改得更好些，把环境改得更好些，把工作效率提得更高些。他初到晋察冀边区，创设正规的模范医院；创立不久，遇到反扫荡，敌人把他的心血都毁了。他就改创立小规模的、以老百姓家为基础的医院。在携带治疗器具方面也是如此。最初，他要带全副器具，一行动就是十多个驮子，这在战争频繁的敌后环境是不适合的。他一到冀中，立刻改为轻装。做手术的时候，用锯子锯大腿，常常带肉下来，他设法用木板做成腰子形，把骨头和肉分开。有人强调敌后困难，工作难于展开，甚至把工作缺点推到客观条件上去。他却想法在困难条件下，把工作做好，效率提高。
    他严正不私。他的一举一动，完全为了革命工作，为人民服务，从不为自己打算。当他到一个军分区卫生部，发现病人没有被子，严厉批评了卫生工作人员，坚持要先把他自己的和工作人员的被子给伤病员盖。他发现一个伤员因为没上夹板，而要割断腿子，再三追问这个医生，要处罚他，要报告他的上级。他说，“做卫生工作，不这样严格认真是不行的。我们要不客气的批评，对个人的虚荣要残酷。”他领导下的卫生工作人员，就养成了这样一种严肃的正派作风和原则精神，大家互相督促。毛主席说：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人”。白求恩大夫就是这样崇高的人。
    他不怕困难。困难在英雄的大勇和智慧面前低头。任何困难工作，只要于伤病员有益，他都不顾一切去做。他在冀中时，听到游击区有伤病员，离敌人据点只有一二十里地，敌人随时可以包围这些村庄，他也要去。他去治疗伤病员以后，村庄果然被包围了，如果不是军民的严密组织，差几分钟就真的要做俘虏了。他却处之泰然，以为远在敌人包围中的游击区伤病员能受到他的诊治，是他生平最大的快乐！这是多么高尚的风格！
    他生活艰苦朴素。一个生长在资本主义社会上等人家的大夫，而且是世界上屈指可数的专家，英国皇家学会外科学士会的会员，过去生活水平是可以想到的。他到战时中国来，已经不易，何况是敌后，又何况是穷山恶水的冀西山地，但他却以为一生当中最愉快的日子是在这个区域里过的。他穿八路军布衣，穿八路军的草鞋，吃八路军简简单单的饭菜。军区为了照顾他的生活习惯，特地给他一个炊事员，他的伙食可以实报实销。但他要求和八路军战士一样的生活。炊事员如果给他做点较好的饭菜，马上就受到他的责备。甚至负责同志欢宴他，他也说：“我觉得你们对我当客人，准备了这么多的菜，太浪费，我感到很不舒服。”
    他从善如流，有高度的自我批评的精神。他善于责人，也善于责己。在真理之前，并无你我之分，只有是非之别。他常说：“我有什么不对的地方，希望你们给我批评，我将百分之百地在工作中来改正。”有一次在冀中，由于连续三天三夜的手术，紧张而又繁忙的工作使得他烦躁了，看见什么也不顺眼，对什么人也不满意，发了脾气。他的翻译从未和他口角过，这次居然也吵起来了。事后，他对翻译检讨：“不要见怪我，我实在太疲劳了。脾气不好，请原谅我。”他对王震将军介绍去的医务主任认识不足，后来在工作与学习中发现了自己的错误，就立即写信给王震将军：“过去，我对于×××的认识是错的。你对他的认识是对的。他还能够工作和学习，只要他努力下去，是可能成为一个好的外科医生的。现在，我对你承认我的错误。”
    他诲人不倦，帮助别人一道进步。他随时随地总想把他的技术和知识尽量传授给别人，帮助别人。每天看完病人以后，他还要给医务人员上课，但是没有教材，一块黑板算是大家的课本，他在上面写，绘，来讲授。疲劳了一天，到了晚上，他还要在灯下写一本专为医生和护士用的图解手册。为了提高边区医务人员技能，他创办模范医院和特种外科医院，调各地区代表来实习，回去再传授别人。在冀中工作一个时期，他有了丰富的战地治疗经验，一回到冀西山地，就着手写关于这方面的书。他从不把自己知道的东西秘密起来，而是在想怎样告诉别人，帮助别人提高到先进的水平上来。
    更重要的，是他的舍己为人的无产阶级的高贵品质。他说：“一个医生，一个看护，一个事务员的责任是什么呢？只有一个责任。那就是使你的病人快乐，帮助他恢复健康，恢复力量。你必须把他们每一个人都看作是你的兄弟，你的父亲——因为就真理说，是的，他们比兄弟父母还要亲切些，他是你的同志。在一切事情当中，要把他放在最前头。”在最危险的时候，在生死存亡的时候，最容易看出一个人的品质来。这是试金石。白求恩大夫在这种时候，他首先考虑的不是自己的安危，而是伤病员的存亡。在冀中前线上，他的救护站附近受到炮火的轰击，他不动声色，继续在抢救伤员。在冀西王安镇附近的小庙里，当时受到敌人的包围，敌人就要到了，他为了救护伤员，不肯走。伤员甚至希望自己牺牲也不要紧，要他走，他也不肯走。他估计可以抢做完手术，冒着最大的生命危险，终于做完了才走。他说，“伤员的伤越早做越好，早做可以减轻伤员的痛苦，可以减少伤员的死亡。”最后，为了急于抢治一个伤员的头部创伤，匆忙中做手术时，他忘了戴橡皮手套。他的中指本来受了刀伤。这时，伤员创口里的细菌却暗中潜入了他的伤口，使他受了感染，而且病情逐渐恶化，终于他自己的宝贵的生命也献给了伤员，献给了无产阶级的革命事业。
    白求恩大夫为什么能够这样舍己为人呢？因为他是一个普通的人，同时也是一个特殊的人。普通的人，是他生活在人民当中，老老实实为人民服务；同时，他是一个共产党员，是一个特殊的人，是具有最崇高品质的人，是无产阶级的光辉战士，毫无一点一滴的自私自利的欲望，他的唯一的欲望，就是为人民革命事业服务，而且是毫无代价的服务，毫无条件的服务，为加拿大人民服务，为中国人民服务，为全世界劳动人民服务，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。惟有共产党员才能有这样崇高的品质，也惟有共产党员才能有这样宽大的胸怀和国际主义的精神。这就是毛主席所说的：“一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当做他自己的事业，这是什么精神？这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神，每一个中国共产党员都要学习这种精神。”
    白求恩大夫虽然逝世二十年了，但是，他又何曾离开我们呢？随着革命队伍的扩大和革命事业发展，我们前进的行列当中不断涌现出千千万万闪耀着共产主义光芒的战士。依靠他们和人民，在党的领导下取得中国革命的胜利，现在又不断取得社会主义建设的伟大胜利。最近全国群英大会上英雄们报告的丰功伟绩，不是生动地说明了这个事实吗？而具有共产主义精神的人，一定永远活在人民当中，向着伟大的道路，开辟社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业！
