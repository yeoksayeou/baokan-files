Xinhua News Agency, 15th. In the second friendly match of the Soviet National Youth Men's and Women's Basketball Teams' visit to China, held tonight at the Beijing Gymnasium, the men's team lost to the Beijing Men's Basketball Team with a score of 64-68, and the women's team defeated the Beijing Women's Basketball Team with a score of 65-55.

    The men's game was very exciting, with applause from more than 6,000 spectators one after another. The visiting team started with a strong lineup led by Rezzhava (No. 10), a giant with a height of 2.08 meters and a weight of 125 kilograms. The home team's five players included Qian Chenghai, Yang Boyong, and Wang Lifa, who were flexible and fast, and accurate in shooting, and launched fast breaks repeatedly. At the same time, Ju Fenkan, a center with a height of 1.98 meters, and Zhang Xishan, a guard, worked hard to defend the giant Rezzhava, so they played smoothly and scored ahead. When the home team was leading 19-16 after nearly thirteen minutes, the visiting team suddenly replaced Rezzhava, Vartin (No. 4), who was 2.01 meters tall and agile, and Mosheshvili (No. 5), a main player with a height of 1.95 meters who was good at cutting into the basket for layups. The home team took this opportunity to launch a continuous attack, and led by fourteen points with a score of 37-23 at the end of the first half.

    In the second half, the visiting team put Rezzhava and other three main players back on the field and launched a tenacious counterattack. The home team did not give in, and the score remained ahead. But later, Rezzhava was very active under the basket, and he put the ball into the basket as soon as he received the ball passed by other players. Although Vartin and Mosheshvili were tall, they were very agile and accurate in shooting, posing a great threat to the home team. With just over seven minutes left in the game, the visiting team tied the score at 52-52, and then took the lead with 54-52, 56-53, and 56-54. At this time, the atmosphere on the court was very tense, and the audience applauded continuously. The home team calmly responded and worked hard to compete with the tall visiting team players for rebounds. After tying the score at 56-56 and 57-57, Ju Fenkan and Yang Boyong scored consecutive shots and free throws, and the score began to lead again until the end of the game.

    In the women's game, Ostapenko (No. 7), who was tall and heavy, and national team players Ottersa (No. 6) and Kissinger (No. 9) performed very well today. They actively fought for the ball and weaved around under the basket to shoot, making it difficult for the home team to defend.

    The home team did not play calmly enough today. Although they used fast breaks to launch attacks many times, they missed too many shots. In addition, they could not grab rebounds as well as the opponent, so they were repeatedly subjected to the visiting team's fast break counterattacks. At the end of the first half, they were six points behind with a score of 32-38.

    In the second half, although the home team worked hard to counterattack, there were still many mistakes, and they finally lost to the visiting team by ten points.

    中苏篮球足球精采友谊赛
    苏国家女子篮球队65比55取胜
    北京男子篮球队68比64赢4分
    新华社15日讯　苏联国家青年男、女篮球队今晚在北京体育馆比赛馆举行访华第二次友谊比赛中，男子队以六十四比六十八败给了北京男子篮球队，女子队以六十五比五十五战胜了北京女子篮球队。
    男子队的比赛非常精采，六千多名观众的掌声一阵接着一阵。客队一上场就排出了以身高两米零八、体重一百二十五公斤的巨人列扎瓦（十号）为首的强劲阵容。主队的五员选手中，包括了灵活快速、投篮准确的钱澄海、杨伯镛和王利发等人，屡屡展开快攻；同时由身高一米九十八的中锋鞠汾康和后卫张锡山两人努力防守巨人列扎瓦，因此打来顺手，得分一直领先。打到近十三分钟主队以十九比十六领先时，客队突然把列扎瓦和身高两米零一、动作灵活的瓦尔京（四号），以及善于切入上篮、身高一米九十五的主力队员莫谢什维利（五号）三人同时换下，主队乘这个机会连续猛攻，上半场结束时以三十七比二十三领先了十四分。
    下半场客队又把列扎瓦等三名主力队员调上场，顽强反攻，主队也不相让，比分仍然一直领先。但后来列扎瓦在篮下十分活跃，他一接到其他队员传来的球就把球投入篮内。瓦尔京、莫谢什维利两人身材虽高，但很灵活，投篮也准，给主队威胁很大。到比赛还剩最后七分多钟时，客队竟追成五十二平，以后反以五十四比五十二、五十六比五十三、五十六比五十四领先。这时场上气氛十分紧张，观众掌声不断，主队沉着应战，努力同身材高大的客队选手争夺篮板球，追成五十六平、五十七平以后，鞠汾康、杨伯镛连续投篮、罚球命中，得分又开始领先，直到终场。
    女子队的比赛，客队身高体重的奥斯塔平科（七号）和国家队选手奥特萨（六号）、基辛格（九号）等人今天表演十分出色。她们争球积极，在篮下左右穿插投篮，使主队很难防守。
    主队今天打得不够沉着，她们虽然多次用快攻的办法展开进攻，但投篮失误太多，加上篮板球抢不过对方，所以反而屡遭客队的快攻反击。上半场结束时就以三十二比三十八落后对方六分。
    下半场主队虽然努力反攻，但失误仍多，最后输给了客队十分。
