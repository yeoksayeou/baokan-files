The higher the enthusiasm of the masses, the more meticulous the safety work
Nanchang Ferroalloy Plant's production continues to advance by leaps and bounds

(Our report) In the high tide of the increasing production and practicing economy campaign, the Nanchang Ferroalloy Plant in Jiangxi Province has strengthened safety production education. Since August, it has overfulfilled the state plan every month, achieving a double leap forward in production and safety.

The Nanchang Ferroalloy Plant mainly produces ferromanganese and silicon iron for steelmaking. The entire production process involves high-temperature operations using high-voltage electricity. Since the factory was put into production last year, the factory Party committee has attached great importance to safety work, effectively preventing major accidents. With the vigorous development of the increasing production and practicing economy campaign, the factory Party committee quickly realized that the more enthusiastic the mass movement, the more important it is to strengthen safety work. To this end, from the end of August, a mass safety production campaign was launched throughout the factory to conduct safety production education. Targeting the idea among some workers that "accidents are unavoidable," the factory organized the masses to conduct airing of views and debates, raising the awareness and enthusiasm of the majority of workers in doing a good job in safety work. Workers now carefully check labor protection, production tools, and mechanical and electrical equipment during shift handover, and have continuously launched three mass safety inspections and many small inspections throughout the factory. Based on the problems identified in the inspections, everyone was mobilized to come up with ideas and find solutions, and made every effort to eliminate all safety accidents. During the major inspections, the factory's workers put forward a total of two hundred and eighty-nine relatively important safety production suggestions. Many accident risks and safety loopholes have been eliminated and blocked in a timely manner. In order to further consolidate safety production work among workers, the factory has also trained a worker in each production team to serve as a part-time safety officer and electrical supervisor, and established a workshop safety inspection system, thereby forming a mass safety network throughout the factory. In terms of management systems, a shift handover safety record, a safety activity day, six safety systems, and sixteen safety operating procedures for various types of work have been established.

Now, a new situation has emerged in the factory where the masses consciously carry out safe production. The safety inspection team of electric furnace Team A, on October 20, took the initiative to handle five safety-related issues, ensuring the normal operation of electric furnace production. The No. 1 400 kVA simple electric furnace created a national advanced record of producing 3,424 kilograms of ferromanganese per day due to the absence of power outages and a long production period.

    群众干劲越高　安全工作越细
    南昌铁合金厂生产不断大踏步前进
    本报讯　江西南昌铁合金工厂在增产节约运动的高潮中，加强了安全生产教育，从8月以来，月月超额完成了国家计划，做到了生产、安全双跃进。
    南昌铁合金工厂主要生产炼钢用的锰铁和矽铁，整个生产过程是高温作业用高压电流，这个厂从去年投入生产以来，厂党委就十分重视安全工作，有效地防止了重大事故的发生。随着增产节约运动的猛烈展开，厂党委迅速觉察到：越是在热火朝天的群众运动中，越要加强安全工作。为此，从8月下旬起便在全厂掀起了一个群众性的安全生产运动，进行安全生产教育，针对部分职工中认为“事故难避免”的思想，组织职工群众进行鸣放辩论，提高了广大职工搞好安全工作的自觉性和积极性，做到了在交接班时都认真检查劳动保护、生产工具和机械、电气设备情况，并在全厂连续展开了三次群众性的安全大检查和多次小检查，根据检查出的问题，发动大家出主意、想办法，千方百计杜绝一切安全事故。在大检查中，全厂职工先后提出了二百八十九条比较重要的安全生产建议。许多事故苗头、安全漏洞都及时消灭和堵塞了。为了把安全生产工作在职工中进一步巩固下来，这个厂又在每一个生产小组中培养了一名工人当兼职安全员和电气监督员，并建立了车间安全检查制度，从而在全厂形成了一个群众性的安全网。在管理制度上，建立了交接班安全纪录、安全活动日六项安全制度，和各工种十六项安全操作规程。
    现在，全厂出现了群众自觉进行安全生产的新面貌。电炉甲班的安全检查小组，在10月20日一天内，就主动处理了五个有关安全问题，保证了电炉生产的正常进行。一号四百千伏安简易电炉，就因为没有停电事故、生产期长，而创造了日产锰铁三千四百二十四公斤的全国先进纪录。
