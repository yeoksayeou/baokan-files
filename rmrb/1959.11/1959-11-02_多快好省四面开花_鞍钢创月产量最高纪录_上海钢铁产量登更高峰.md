Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 1st: Anshan Iron and Steel Company workers pushed production levels to unprecedented heights in October. Major products such as steel, pig iron, steel materials, steel billets, and metallurgical coke all overfulfilled their October plans, achieving an all-around production triumph. Compared to the state plan, October saw an increase of 13,000 tons of steel, over 6,400 tons of pig iron, and over 48,000 tons of steel materials, setting Anshan Iron and Steel's highest monthly output record in history. The quality of major products also generally improved, and costs were greatly reduced, truly achieving comprehensive blooming with high speed, good quality, and cost efficiency.

The unprecedented victory in Anshan Iron and Steel's October production fully demonstrated the enormous power of mass movements centered around technical performance competitions. In October, Anshan Iron and Steel's technical performance competitions developed from scattered performances in various factories and mines to joint and coordinated performances. From October 15th to 31st, two consecutive weeks of joint technical performance competitions were held. About 90% of the company's workers participated in technical performances, and technical innovation cases, advanced experiences, and new production records emerged in endlessly. In the first ten days of the joint technical performance competition, more than 14,700 technical innovations, more than 5,670 advanced experiences, and tens of thousands of new production records emerged from various factories and mines. Since the launch of the joint technical performance competition, steelmaking fighters have successively created this year's highest daily steel output record three times. Steelmaking plant workers have developed the "pouring iron water" experience, which has expanded the steel production of open-hearth furnaces. This advanced experience is now being fully promoted in Anshan Iron and Steel's three major steelmaking plants. Through technical performance competitions, the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant created a set of experiences such as quick return air, more discharge of upper slag, and quick tapping, ensuring that the blast furnace achieves high air volume, high air temperature, high load, high operating rate, and high pressure, greatly improving smelting intensity. The utilization coefficient of the entire plant's blast furnace leaped from a maximum of 1.639 in the highest month to 1.753.

The development of joint technical performance competitions has rapidly improved Anshan Iron and Steel's production level. Compared with the first fourteen days of October, steel production in the first joint technical performance competition week increased sharply by 13.1%, pig iron increased sharply by 12.1%, and steel materials increased sharply by 26.3%. In the second joint technical performance competition week, steel production continued to increase by 5.9%, and the production level of steel materials increased by 3.1%.

At present, Anshan Iron and Steel workers are advancing victoriously, determined to continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, vigorously engage in technical performance competitions, and win an all-around production triumph in November.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 1st: Shanghai's steel industry workers continued to exert their full energy in October, vigorously engaging in mass record-breaking movements and technical operation performance competitions, bringing the production levels of steel and steel materials to even higher peaks. This month, the city's steel output was 23% higher than the highest month of September, and steel output was 29% higher than last month.

At the beginning of October, the Shanghai Metallurgical Bureau and the Shanghai Iron and Steel Party Committee, based on the large-scale mass movement in the iron and steel industry in August and September, continued to mobilize workers to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and carry out record-breaking movements and technical operation performance competitions. Technical innovations, advanced experiences, and new production records blossomed everywhere. For example, the quick furnace-building operation method created by Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5 has been promoted in all steelmaking workshops in the city after several technical performances. The furnace-building time in various plants has generally been reduced from more than ten hours to three or four hours. Workers in other plants have also created advanced experiences such as quick cupola building, baking furnace building, iron ladle and steel ladle building, quick charging, and quick steelmaking. The charging time for open-hearth furnaces in Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 used to be very long. The workers created "herringbone" and "plum blossom" charging methods, shortening the charging time for each furnace of steel by ten to twenty minutes. The national converter red banner—Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6—encountered electric welding rod steel, which requires particularly high smelting technology, in October. Steel output declined somewhat in the first few days of the month. Later, after vigorously carrying out technical innovation, they created advanced operating methods such as extending the life of cupola furnaces and shortening smelting time. Furthermore, technical performance competitions were launched among nine types of work, including steelmaking, casting, furnace repair, and slag removal, so that the daily output of steel increased day by day. They created the nation's highest converter utilization coefficient (fixed furnace base) of 24.6 in October, and the total monthly steel output exceeded the plan by 34.8%.

    多快好省四面开花
    鞍钢创月产量最高纪录　上海钢铁产量登更高峰
    新华社鞍山1日电　鞍山钢铁公司职工在10月份把生产水平推上从未有过的高峰。钢、生铁、钢材、钢坯、冶金焦炭等主要产品，都超额完成了10月份计划，赢得了生产满堂红。同国家计划比，10月份增产钢一万三千吨、生铁六千四百多吨、钢材四万八千多吨，创造了鞍钢有史以来月产量最高纪录。主要产品的质量也都普遍提高，成本大大降低，真是多快好省四面开花。
    鞍钢10月份生产获得空前大捷，充分显示了以技术表演竞赛为中心的群众运动的巨大威力。10月份鞍钢的技术表演竞赛，从各厂矿分散表演发展到联合协同表演，从10月15日到31日，连续两次举行联合技术表演竞赛周，全公司有90％右右的职工参加了技术表演，技术革新事例、先进经验和生产新纪录层出不穷。在联合技术表演竞赛的最初十天里，各厂矿就涌现出一万四千七百多件技术革新，五千六百七十多项先进经验，成千上万项生产新纪录。炼钢战士们在开展联合技术表演竞赛运动以来，就连续三次创造今年以来钢日产量的最高纪录。炼钢厂职工发展了“兑铁水”的经验，扩大了平炉的产钢量，现在这一先进经验，正在鞍钢三大炼钢厂全面推广。鞍钢炼铁厂通过技术表演赛，创造了回风快、多放上部渣子、出铁快等一套经验，保证高炉作到高风量、高风温、高负荷、高作业率和高压，大大提高了冶炼强度，全厂高炉利用系数从最高月份的一点六三九跃进到一点七五三。
    联合技术表演赛的开展，使鞍钢生产水平飞速地提高。第一次联合技术表演竞赛周与10月头十四天比较，钢猛增13.1％、生铁猛增12.1％、钢材猛增26.3％；在第二次联合技术表演竞赛周里，钢产量又继续增长5.9％、钢材的生产水平增长3.1％。
    目前，鞍钢职工正乘胜前进，决心继续反右倾、鼓干劲，大闹技术表演赛，夺取11月生产满堂红。
    新华社上海1日电　上海钢铁工业职工在10月份继续鼓足干劲，大搞群众性的创纪录运动，大搞技术操作表演赛，使钢、钢材的生产水平跃进到更高的高峰。这个月，全市钢产量比最高的9月份高出23％，钢材产量比上月高出29％。
    10月份一开始，上海市冶金局和中共上海钢铁党委，在8、9月钢铁工业大搞群众运动的基础上，继续发动职工反右倾、鼓干劲，开展创新纪录运动和技术操作表演赛，技术革新、先进经验和生产新纪录遍地开花。如上钢五厂创造的快速砌炉操作法，经过几次技术表演，已在全市各炼钢车间里推广，各厂砌炉时间普遍从十多个小时缩短到三、四小时。其他厂的工人又创造了快速砌化铁炉、砌烘钢炉，砌铁水包和钢水包，快速上料，快速炼钢等先进经验。上钢一厂平炉加料时间过去一直很长，工人们创造了“人字形”和“梅花形”的加料法，使每炉钢的加料时间缩短了一、二十分钟。全国转炉红旗——上钢六厂，10月份遇到冶炼技术要求特别高的电焊条钢，月初几天钢产量有所下降，以后经过大闹技术革新，创造了延长化铁炉寿命、缩短冶炼时间等先进操作法，并且在炼钢、浇钢、修炉、清渣等九个工种之间开展技术表演赛，使钢的日产量一天比一天上升，创造10月份转炉利用系数（固定式炉座）达到二十四点六的全国最高纪录，全月钢产量超过计划34.8％。
