Collect More Mountain Products, Process Them Quickly
Liaoning's Mountain Product Acquisition in Ten Days Increased by Ninety Percent Compared to Last Year's Entire Year
Heilongjiang Strengthens Technical Guidance, Wild Raw Materials Achieve a Bumper Harvest
Fujian Uses Wild Plants to Make Products to Supply Needs Across Various Regions

(Reported by this newspaper) A high tide of "small autumn harvest" of collecting wild plant raw materials has already formed throughout Liaoning Province. Nineteen counties, including Kuandian, Beizhen, Suizhong, Qingyuan, and Andong, have mobilized more than 400,000 people to go to the mountains, forests, and grasslands to widely collect various wild plant raw materials. The Andong, Benxi, and Lushun areas, as well as Xifeng, Kaiyuan, and Tieling in Shenyang City, have already harvested 66 million jin of various mountain goods and wild fruits. The province's acquisition volume from October 10th to 20th, these ten days, is 546,000 jin more than the total acquisition volume from the two months of early August to early October, an increase of more than 90% compared to the entire year of 1958. Currently, the province has overfulfilled the annual acquisition plan, increasing the income of communes and commune members by more than 8.54 million yuan.

While vigorously engaging in "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing), Party committees at all levels seized the ripening season of wild plant raw materials, widely mobilized the masses, and launched short-term offensives. The Kuandian County Party Committee determined that October 13th to 20th would be a shock week for collecting wild oilseeds, mobilizing students, women, the elderly, the weak, semi-laborers, and office cadres, dividing them into three routes, and advancing into the deep mountains and dense forests. By October 15th, the county had already acquired more than 8.3 million jin of mountain pears, hawthorns, mountain grapes, and jujubes, of which the purchase volume of mountain pears exceeded the original acquisition plan by more than 1.9 million jin. To ensure a bumper harvest of mountain fruits, leaving no grain behind, commercial departments are organizing the masses to vigorously process and utilize them. The county has already processed 1.4 million jin of dried pears and used mountain pears to process more than 20,000 jin of fruit wine. The Andong County Party Committee mobilized an army of 15,000 people to go deep into the barren mountains and wild fields to vigorously engage in the "small autumn harvest." During the autumn harvest, the secretary of the Beijingzi Commune took the lead, and members of the Party committee divided up responsibilities by area, mobilizing more than 3,000 elderly, young, and female laborers to collect wild raw materials. The Beijingzi Supply and Marketing Cooperative acquired more than 50,000 jin of cockleburs alone, increasing the income of commune members by more than 2,000 yuan.

Commercial departments in various regions actively launched large-scale acquisition activities, ensuring that every team had a collection point and that people were everywhere, acquiring wherever the collections happened, which greatly facilitated the masses in selling their goods.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin – More than 10,000 professional and technical personnel have been dispatched to various parts of Heilongjiang Province to organize the acquisition, transportation, and processing of wild plants, while also providing technical guidance to the masses on collection, storage, transportation, and preliminary processing, promoting a high-quality, high-yield “small autumn harvest.”

The professional and technical personnel dispatched to various regions have, in accordance with the harvesting season and the types of varieties needed by factories, prioritized the collection of wild plants. For example, in terms of medicinal materials, under the guidance of professional and technical personnel from medicinal material companies in various regions, efforts are first concentrated on collecting medicinal materials such as Schisandra chinensis and Astragalus membranaceus, which are urgently needed by the market and for export. The harvesting of medicinal materials such as Stellera chamaejasme, which are slow-selling and can be collected anywhere, is appropriately controlled to avoid wasting manpower. Wine factories in various counties throughout the province have dispatched technical personnel to help farmers master the storage technology of mountain grapes and acorns to avoid insect infestation. Paper mills have also dispatched personnel to guide the collection of reeds.

To ensure the success of the "small autumn harvest," Party committees at all levels in Heilongjiang Province are led by their secretaries, strengthening leadership. Important wild plants, like agricultural and sideline products, have been included in production plans, mobilizing the broad masses to go to the mountains and forests to collect them. As of mid-October, the province had collected 5.1 billion jin of wild plants, with a value of more than 81 million yuan, an increase of two times compared to the same period last year. It is estimated that by the end of November, another 1.8 billion jin can be collected.

(Reported by this newspaper) A large number of finished and semi-finished products made from wild plants from all parts of Fujian have been continuously transported to various places inside and outside the province to supply market needs.

Under the correct leadership of Party committees at all levels, the broad masses in Fujian Province have collected a large number of wild plants. According to statistics from commercial departments: from January to September of this year, a total of more than 110,000 dan of wild fiber were purchased, of which 36,000 dan were purchased in August and September, an increase of 37% compared to the actual purchase volume in the first half of the year.

The processing of wild plants has long been underway in various parts of Fujian. According to statistics, the province's commercial departments have established as many as 422 wild plant processing factories, making full use of wild plants to produce rayon, weave sacks, make ropes, extract perfume oil, and brew wine, creating wealth for the country and increasing income for the masses. For example, counties such as Changting, Jian'ou, and Fuding, which are rich in wild fiber, have established specialized processing factories to use wild fiber to produce various industrial and civilian fabrics in large quantities. Counties such as Nan'an and Lianjiang also widely use wild fiber to process sacks. Various sack factories in Fuzhou, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and other cities use wild fibers such as Abutilon theophrasti, Hibiscus mutabilis, and Canna indica to weave sacks, the quality of which is no less than those woven from jute. Two specialized processing factories in Fuding County have used wild fiber to weave more than 25,000 meters of industrial and civilian fabrics and mosquito netting, which has played an important role in increasing the supply of market materials and supporting the packaging and transportation of industry and agriculture.

    多多采山货　快快来加工
    辽宁十天收购山货量比去年全年增九成
    黑龙江加强技术指导野生原料丰产丰收
    福建用野生植物制成商品供应各地需要
    本报讯　采集野生植物原料的“小秋收”高潮，已经在辽宁全省范围内形成。宽甸、北镇、绥中、清原、安东等十九个县就发动了四十多万人上山、入林、进草原，广泛采集各种野生植物原料。仅安东、本溪、旅大地区，以及沈阳市的西丰、开原、铁岭等地，就已经采收各种山货野果六千六百万斤。全省从10月10日到20日这十天的收购量，比8月初到10月上旬两个月的收购量的总和还多五十四万六千多斤，比1958年全年的收购量增加90％以上。目前全省已超额完成全年收购计划，为公社和社员增加八百五十四万多元的收入。
    各级党委在大搞“三秋”的同时，抓住了野生植物原料的成熟季节，广泛发动群众，展开了短期突击。宽甸县委确定从10月13日到20日为采集野生油料突击周，发动学生、妇女、老弱半劳力和机关干部，分成三路，向深山密林进军。到10月15日，全县已经收购山梨、山里红、山葡萄、元枣等山果八百三十多万斤，其中山梨购量超过原定收购计划一百九十多万斤。为了保证山果丰产丰收，颗粒不丢，商业部门正组织群众大力加工利用。全县已加工梨干一百四十万斤，用山梨加工果酒二万余斤。安东县委发动一万五千名大军深入荒山野地大闹“小秋收”。北井子公社在秋收当中，书记挂帅，党委委员分片包干，发动了三千多老年、少年和妇女劳力，采集野生原料。北井子供销社收购的苍耳子一项就有五万多斤，为社员增加收入二千多元。
    各地商业部门积极地展开了大收大购活动，做到了队队有点、处处有人，哪里采集就在哪里收购，大大地方便了群众出售。
    新华社哈尔滨讯　黑龙江省各地派出一万多个专业技术人员，一面组织野生植物收购、调运和加工，一面对群众进行采集、储运和初加工等技术指导，促使“小秋收”保质保量，丰产丰收。
    各地派出的专业技术人员，对野生植物的采集，按收获季节先后和工厂需要品种进行了排队。如药材方面，在各地药材公司专业技术人员的指导下，先集中力量采集目前市场和出口迫切需要的五味子、黄芪等药材，对销路滞、随地可采的狼毒等药材适当控制采摘，以免浪费人力。全省各县的制酒厂都派出技术人员帮助农民掌握山葡萄、橡子的储藏技术，避免生虫。各造纸厂也派出工作人员指导采集芦苇。
    黑龙江省各地党委为了保证做好“小秋收”，都是书记挂帅，加强领导，重要的野生植物都像农副产品一样制订了生产计划，发动广大群众上山入林采集。到10月中旬止，全省已经采集野生植物五十一亿斤，产值达八千一百多万元，比去年同期增加了两倍；预计到11月底，还能采集十八亿斤。
    本报讯　福建各地用野生植物制成的大批成品和半成品，已源源运往省内外各地，供应市场需要。
    福建全省在各级党委正确领导下，广大群众采集了大量野生植物。据商业部门统计：今年1至9月共计收购野生纤维十一万多担，其中8、9月收购三万六千担，比上半年实际收购量增长37％。
    福建各地利用野生植物的加工工作，早已开展起来。据统计，全省商业部门建立的野生植物加工厂即达四百二十二个，充分利用野生植物生产人造棉、织麻袋、打绳子、提炼香料油和酿酒等，为国家创造了财富，群众也增加了收入。如盛产野生纤维的长汀、建瓯、福鼎等县，都成立专业加工厂，利用野生纤维，大量生产各种工业用布和民用布。南安、连江等县也广泛利用野生纤维加工麻袋。福州、漳州、泉州等市各个麻袋厂利用野青麻、木芙蓉、美人蕉等野生纤维织成的麻袋，质量不亚于用黄麻织的。福鼎县两个专业加工厂，利用野生纤维织成二万五千多米工业用布、民用布和帐罗，对增加市场物资供应和支援工农业的包装、运输起了重要的作用。
