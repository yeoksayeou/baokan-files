    A Profound Communist Education
    During the National Day celebrations, I watched many good films and I am grateful for the education these excellent films have given us.
    As a former soldier of the Hui Muslim Detachment and a comrade of Benzhai, I couldn’t help but feel deeply moved and thoughtful after watching "Hui Muslim Detachment."
    "Hui Muslim Detachment" is a very good film. It not only vividly depicts the growth process of a heroic son of the Hui people and describes how the Han and Hui people fought side by side against national enemies and changed their relationship in the struggle, but more importantly, it vividly reveals the essence of the national question. It points out the universal truth that "without the Party, there is nothing for the nationalities." It uses facts to illustrate that the essence of the national question is a class question. Commissar Guo, a Han cadre, helped Comrade Benzhai overcome attacks from enemies within the nationality at the moment when the "Hui people" were wavering and splitting. When Comrade Benzhai faced many difficulties, Commissar Guo patiently and sincerely educated him, raised his political consciousness, and finally made him a member of the proletarian vanguard. It was this "foreign" revolutionary soldier who finally contributed his most precious life for the complete liberation of the Hui people and the people of the whole country. How could there be such a hero without the working class party? Therefore, it is not enough to merely admire the revolutionary qualities of Commissar Guo; it should be said that without the Party, there would be no revolutionary soldiers like Commissar Guo. He embodied the leadership of the Party, and it is the Party that has given our Hui people a happy today. With Chairman Mao, the Hui people and all ethnic groups have achieved true liberation and can be as closely united as they are today.
    In the fifteen years since the death of Comrade Benzhai, the changes in the motherland have been so great! Our Party has led the people of all nationalities across the country to defeat Japanese imperialism, overthrow the three great mountains weighing on the people's heads, achieve a complete victory in the democratic revolution, carry out the great socialist revolution, and launch a vigorous socialist construction. Under the cultivation of the Party, how many heroes have emerged among the Hui people and all ethnic groups. Today, the truth that "without the absolute leadership of the Party, there would be no prosperity and happiness for the Hui people and all ethnic groups, and there would be nothing for the nationalities" is becoming increasingly clear.
    The film will be an extremely important inspiration for our ethnic cadres, requiring Party's ethnic cadres to have clear love and hatred, a firm class stance, and the ability to distinguish between right and wrong. They must truly love our Party, our Chairman Mao, the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, the People's Communes...and the thousands of new "Guo Zhengweis" – Han cadres – cultivated by the Party and Chairman Mao, and dare to contribute everything for the Party and socialism. Conversely, they must hate the enemies of socialism, the right-leaning opportunists and their ideas, truly hate them, and resolutely overthrow and overcome them. As early as 1950, Chairman Mao taught us that "to thoroughly solve the national question and isolate national reactionaries, it is impossible without a large number of communist cadres from national minorities." This points out the importance of cultivating ethnic cadres, and further illustrates that ethnic cadres must be communized. It is inconceivable that ethnic cadres can do anything good for the nationality or the people without being communized.

    一次深刻的共产主义教育
    国庆期间，看了许多好影片，感谢这些优秀影片给我们的教育。
    作为曾是回民支队的一个战士和本斋同志的战友，当我看了“回民支队”之后，不能不引起无限的激动和深思。
    “回民支队”是一部很好的影片，它不仅生动地描述了回族的一个英雄儿子的成长过程，描述了回汉人民并肩打击民族敌人，并在斗争中改变了相互关系，而且更重要的是它形象地揭示了民族问题的本质，指出了“没有党，就没有民族的一切”这一普遍真理，用事实说明了民族问题的实质是阶级问题。郭政委这位汉族干部，在“回回自己人”闹动摇分裂的时刻，帮助本斋同志克服了来自民族内部敌人的打击；在本斋同志面临许多困难的时候，郭政委耐心诚恳地教育了他，提高了他的政治觉悟，使他终于成为无产阶级先锋部队中的一员。正是这位“外族”的革命战士，最后为了回族的也是全国人民的彻底解放，贡献了自己最宝贵的生命。不是工人阶级的党，怎么会有这样的英雄？因此仅仅敬爱郭政委的革命品质，那是太不够了，应该说，没有党，就不会出现像郭政委这样的革命战士，他体现了党的领导，是党才使我们回族人民有幸福的今天。有了毛主席，回族和各族人民才得到真正的解放，也才能像今天这样地亲密团结。
    本斋同志病故后的十五年中，祖国的变化是多么大呵！我们党领导全国各族人民击败了日本帝国主义，推翻了压在人民头上的三座大山，取得了民主革命的彻底胜利，进行着伟大的社会主义革命，展开了轰轰烈烈的社会主义建设。在党的培养下，回族和各族人民中又涌现出多少英雄。今天“没有党的绝对领导，就没有回族和各族人民的繁荣幸福，就没有民族的一切”这条真理也越来越显示了它的真谛。
    影片对我们民族干部将是一个极为重要的启示，要求党的民族干部必须爱憎分明，要有坚定的阶级立场和明辨大是大非，对于我们的党、我们的毛主席，对于总路线、大跃进、人民公社……对于党和毛主席所培养的千百个新的“郭政委”——汉族干部，要真爱，要敢于为党为社会主义贡献自己的一切。相反地，对于社会主义的敌人，对于右倾机会主义分子及其思想，要恨，要真恨，要深恶痛绝地把他们打倒和克服掉。毛主席早在1950年就教导我们“要彻底解决民族问题，孤立民族反动派，没有大批的民族出身的共产主义干部是不可能的”。这里指出了培养民族干部的重要性，更说明了民族干部非共产主义化不可。不能设想，民族干部可以不共产主义化，而能给民族给人民做好什么事情。中共云南省委边疆工作委员会  王连芳
