Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, November 26th. More than 70,000 handicraft workers in Xi'an City have launched a new upsurge in peak season production.

This winter is the peak season for handicraft production, and this year, Xi'an's handicraft workers are calling it the "golden season." This is because the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has not only put forward new requirements for handicraft production and solved the problem of product sales, but has also provided handicrafts with relatively sufficient raw materials. For example, the supply of bamboo has increased by more than 60% compared to the first half of the year, and wild fibers have increased several times over previous years. In the past, steel was the most scarce, but this year, the local iron needed by handicrafts has basically been supplied locally, and steel can also be delivered to the factory ahead of schedule. Under these favorable circumstances, starting in November, all handicraft workers in the city have mustered even greater efforts to push the increase production and practice economy movement to a new high. 100% of the city's handicraft workers have been involved in the socialist competition movement. In the 4,357 workshops in various factories, red flags of excellence are frequently passed on, and production is rising linearly. The Hu Quanlin Blade Factory's sickle production has increased very slowly in recent years, but this time, after hard work and ingenuity, production has increased by more than 50%. The employees of Shunfeng Cart Factory, which specializes in producing cart frames, recently proposed more than 500 rationalization proposals. The advanced tools and experiences that have now been successfully created, such as the "tire cutting machine" and "electric spot welding method," have increased work efficiency by several times to more than eighty times respectively.

Xi'an's handicrafts not only undertake about half of the handicraft production tasks in Shaanxi Province, but also support other provinces and regions in the Northwest. This year, with the deepening of the labor competition movement, the level of handicraft production has been rising steadily. Both the variety and quantity of products have exceeded the Great Leap Forward of 1958. According to incomplete statistics, from January to October, the city produced a total of more than 180 million pieces of handicraft products, an increase of 17.6% over last year. Among the 1,278 varieties, 338 are newly added. Many famous brand handicraft products, such as Hu Quanlin's sickles and kitchen knives, and Zhongxingcheng's copper tobacco pipes, which are famous in the Northwest, are produced in large quantities to meet the needs of various places.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, November 25th. On the basis of restoring the level of handicraft production in Jiangxi Province to before August last year, there has been new development since September. According to recent statistics, the variety of handicraft products in the province has increased by 110.45% compared with before August last year, the number of service points has increased by 111% compared with last year, and the number of mobile service teams has increased by 107.73% compared with last year. The output and quality of products have also improved compared to before August last year.

Since September, Party committees and relevant departments at all levels in the province have continued to strengthen their leadership over handicraft production, oppose right-leaning tendencies, encourage hard work, and vigorously carry out mass movements, so that the level of handicraft production has been higher month by month. Taihe, Duchang and other counties have completed their annual total output value plans ahead of schedule. The product varieties of the three major industries of iron, wood and bamboo in Taihe County have now reached 520, an increase of 124 over the same period last year, and the output of major products has doubled compared with the same period last year. Both the variety and quantity of handicraft products in Duchang County have increased by more than 70% compared with last year. The variety of handicraft products in Leping County has increased by 76.1% compared with before August last year, the output has increased by more than doubled, and the quality has also improved significantly.

The development of handicraft production has vigorously supported the rural tool reform movement, promoted agricultural production, and at the same time met the needs of people's lives. During this year's "Sanqiu" production, handicraft workers in Chongren County rushed to produce more than 8,250 No. 2 rapid harvesters in a short period of time, helping various communes to quickly harvest their late rice.

    增产手工业品迎接旺季
    西安七万手工业工人掀起竞赛新高潮  江西省手工业品种增长百分之一百一十
    本报西安26日电　西安市七万多手工业职工，掀起旺季生产新高潮。
    冬季是手工业生产旺季，今年西安手工业职工更称之为“黄金季节”。因为工农业生产的继续跃进，一方面给手工业生产提出了新的要求，解决了产品的销路问题，一方面也给手工业提供了比较充裕的原材料。例如，竹子供应比上半年增加了60％以上，野生纤维比往年增加了几倍。历年来，钢铁最缺乏，而今年手工业所需要的土铁基本上已能就地供应，钢材也能提前到厂。在这种有利形势下，从11月开始，全市手工业职工就鼓足更大干劲，把增产节约运动推向更高潮。全市百分之百的手工业职工都卷入了社会主义竞赛运动。在各厂四千三百五十七个车间里或作坊里，优胜红旗频传，生产直线上升，胡全林刃具厂，几年来镰刀产量提高很慢，这次经过苦战加巧干，产量提高了50％以上。专门生产架子车的顺风车具厂职工最近提出五百多件合理化建议，现在已经创造成功的“瓦圈切断机”、“电点焊接法”等先进工具和经验，分别提高工效几倍到八十多倍。
    西安市的手工业不仅担负着陕西全省手工业生产大约一半的任务，而且要支援西北其他省、区。今年，随着劳动竞赛运动的步步深入，手工业生产水平节节上升。无论产品品种或产品的数量，都超过了大跃进的1958年。根据不完全的统计，1至10月份全市共生产一亿八千余万件手工业产品，比去年增长17.6％。在一千二百七十八种品种中，有三百三十八种是新增加的。很多名牌的手工业产品，如驰名西北的胡全林的镰刀、菜刀，忠兴城的铜烟锅等，都大量生产，供应了各地的需要。
    据新华社南昌25日电　江西省手工业生产在恢复到去年8月以前的水平的基础上，9月份以来又有新的发展。据最近统计，全省手工业产品的品种，比去年8月以前增长110.45％，服务点比去年增加111％，流动服务担，比去年增加107.73％。产品产量和质量也比去年8月以前有所提高。
    从9月份以来，全省各级党委和有关部门继续加强对手工业生产的领导，反右倾、鼓干劲，大搞群众运动，使手工业生产水平一月高过一月。太和、都昌等县手工业都已提前完成了全年总产值计划。太和县铁木篾三大行业的产品品种，现在已达五百二十种，比去年同期增加一百二十四种，主要产品的产量比去年同期增加两倍。都昌县手工业产品品种和数量，都比去年提高70％以上。乐平县手工业产品品种比去年8月以前增加76.1％，产量增加一倍以上，质量也有显著提高。
    手工业生产的发展，大力支援了农村工具改革运动，促进了农业生产，同时满足了人民生活需要。在今年“三秋”生产中，崇仁县手工业工人短期内赶制了二号快速收割器八千二百五十多部，帮助各公社的晚稻很快收获完毕。（附图片）
