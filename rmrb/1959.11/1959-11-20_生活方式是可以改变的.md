    Lifestyles Can Be Changed
    Lí Shù
    Since the emergence of the People's Communes on the Chinese mainland, American imperialist elements have shown great interest in making presumptuous comments. Based on their own wishes, they have determined that the People's Communes will fail. One reason that has been repeated thousands of times is: People's Communes have undermined China's traditional way of life. Because from their point of view, lifestyles are unchangeable. But they have forgotten that when they promoted the American way of life to the rest of the world, they clearly adopted another view, that is, lifestyles can be changed. Because if lifestyles were unchangeable, then the promotion of the American way of life could not expect anyone to pay attention to it. See how the frenzy of aggression has plunged imperialist elements into such a serious logical confusion!
    Are lifestyles unchangeable? No. They can be changed. Their change does not depend on any external force but on the society’s mode of production. What kind of mode of production produces what kind of lifestyle. Primitive people use stone knives and axes to make a living, living in caves or in trees, and can only have a lifestyle of living in caves or in trees. Slaves use the master's means of production to work in the master's fields, living in the master's stables, and can only have a lifestyle of living in the master's stables. Peasants are bound to small plots of land, living in thatched huts, and can only have a lifestyle of living in thatched huts. Wage workers work in capitalist factories, living in slums, and can only have a lifestyle of living in slums. The oppressed and poor people of all ages are not content with their current situation. They are always tending towards a new life, always demanding reform. Predecessors cannot imagine how later generations will live. Later generations will only continue to adopt the lifestyles of their predecessors if they continue to adopt the modes of production of their predecessors. When peasants have the opportunity to leave their thatched huts, workers have the opportunity to move out of the slums, and obtain new living conditions, they will abandon the original lifestyles that were only suitable for thatched huts and slums, and adopt new lifestyles. The influence of tradition will exist, but it will inevitably be constantly weakened by new and newer generations, and replaced by new traditions. This change is so closely linked to changes in economic relations that no force outside of economics can force it to appear suddenly. Peter, who was obsessed with Europeanization, once attempted to use his power as Tsar to change everything in the Russian national life, but in the end, he only transformed some "sham European grotesque writings" (Belinsky) in the upper class of Russia. The vast Russian serfs were not liberated, and their lives could not stop staying in the old place. Modern Chinese bourgeois revolutionaries took imitating Europeans to change their lifestyles as a symbol of revolution, but they did not, and could not, achieve the same change among the broad masses. Before the masses free themselves from poverty, they cannot but continue to adopt the traditional poverty-stricken way of life.
    The great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution has fundamentally changed the mode of production in Chinese society, and thus has also greatly changed the lifestyles of the Chinese people. The boiling revolutionary struggle and collective production organization have made people's lives increasingly closer. But oil, salt, firewood, and rice are still pursued separately, and are the main affairs of the masses’ lives. After the communization of the people's communes, the lifestyles of the vast rural residents began to achieve a fundamental change. Most of the people living scattered established residential points according to the needs of production and life. The establishment of public canteens, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly has truly liberated women. They walked out of the often narrow, smoky kitchens, freed themselves from countless household chores, and participated in production organizations together with their husbands, other members of their families, and their neighbors, and directly obtained their share of food and wages. Due to this change, women for the first time truly became independent members of society, and husbands became more like husbands, rather than patriarchs.
    Are the masses accustomed to this new life? Imperialist elements and domestic and foreign bourgeois elements assume that they cannot get used to it. However, the facts are completely contrary to what these people imagined. Except for the old landlords, rich peasants, and a part of well-to-do middle peasants, the vast majority of the masses quickly got used to it. They welcome the new life and feel real pleasure in the new life, because in the public family, what they lost was only the burden of their family life. Now not only is life guaranteed in the most solid way, but the level has also greatly improved. They receive wages and can dispose of them entirely according to their own needs, so the level of consumption has also greatly improved. In the era of Kuomintang rule, it was very rare to see Chinese peasants who were ragged, but now it is very rare. The masses are filled with gratitude for such a huge change that has occurred in themselves and around them. They cherish everything they have achieved and obtained. In the newly built residential points and public canteens in many rural areas, the masses’ consciousness and noble atmosphere prove that a new lifestyle has been established.
    The emergence of this great phenomenon is the inevitable result of the change in the mode of production. Peasants support the socialist mode of production, so naturally they also support the lifestyle required by the socialist mode of production. It is impossible to oppose this trend.
    Some foreign so-called "China hands" use the little pitiful knowledge they gained in the late Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang era to view the things of the new China, and always believe that Chinese peasants will not change so quickly. They will still miss the old era of poverty and hunger and will be reluctant to part with the ancestral tablets enshrined in the broken thatched huts, and the Bodhisattvas in the nearby temples. No, that is not the case. Worshipping the Bodhisattva is inseparable from poverty for the peasants. When they cannot get rid of poverty, they have no choice but to ask the Bodhisattva for blessing. And once they realize that they themselves are the force to get rid of poverty, they lose the last bit of respect for those clay sculptures and wood carvings. Mao Zedong
  Comrade already pointed out in 1927: "The Bodhisattvas are erected by the peasants, and at a certain time, the peasants will discard these Bodhisattvas with their own hands, without others prematurely taking over to discard the Bodhisattvas." The fact is exactly like this, the peasants threw away the Bodhisattvas with their own hands. Now it is difficult to see traces of superstition in rural areas. What "Guan Sheng Di Jun," "General Yang Si," "Zhong Kui Jinshi," "City God," "Land God," all kinds of minor gods and wild monsters disappeared into smoke. All the ancestral halls have been transformed into public gathering and office places. People's memory of the original appearance of these places has become very faint. Only a very few people over forty years old can tell some stories that happened in these places. But these stories are all blood and tears stories of landlords and bullies oppressing peasants. Mentioning them evokes nothing but hatred, and never evokes any nostalgia for the old era. Are Chinese peasants superstitious? They are not superstitious. When they are not conscious, they believe in many gods, which seems to be superstitious; after they are conscious, they do not believe in any gods. That's the way it is.
    Now the majority of the adult population in rural areas and the main force in production are young people. They are a new generation. It is they who have created the great miracle of the contemporary era and realized the great leap forward in agricultural production. What exists significantly in them is the diligence and bravery of the Chinese working people. They are the builders of the new socialist life. They adapt to and love this new lifestyle, and in the future, they will transform it even better. An article published by the American "Newsweek" on October 12, 1959, lamented: "The Communist Party's social reforms have irreversibly changed the Chinese way of life." Yes, this change is irreversible, let those fools who want to "reverse" China back to the old era grieve for their own irreversible failure.

### 生活方式是可以改变的

    生活方式是可以改变的
    黎澍
    自从人民公社在中国大陆出现以来，美国的帝国主义分子就表现出评头品足的极大的兴趣。他们按照自己的愿望，断定人民公社会要失败。一个曾经被千百次重复过的理由就是：人民公社破坏了中国的传统的生活方式。因为从他们看来，生活方式是不可改变的。可是他们忘记了，他们在向世界各地推行美国生活方式的时候，所采取的显然是另外一个观点，即生活方式是可以改变的。因为如果生活方式是不可改变的，那么，美国生活方式的推行就不可能指望有任何人加以理睬了。试看侵略的狂热使帝国主义分子陷入了多么严重的逻辑的混乱！
    生活方式是不可改变的吗？不。它是可以改变的。它的改变不取决于任何外力而取决于社会的生产方式。什么样的生产方式产生什么样的生活方式。原始人用石刀石斧谋生，住在洞窟里或住在树上，就只能有住在洞窟里或住在树上的生活方式。奴隶用主人的生产工具在主人的田地里劳动，住在主人的马厩里，就只能有住在主人的马厩里的生活方式。农民被束缚在小块土地上，住在茅屋里，就只能有住在茅屋里的生活方式。雇佣工人在资本家的工厂里做工，住在贫民窟里，就只能有住在贫民窟里的生活方式。一切时代的被压迫的和贫穷的人们都并不安于他们的现状。他们永远趋向于新的生活，永远要求改革。前人不能设想后人怎样过活。后人只有在他们继续采取前人的生产方式的条件下，才会继续采取前人的生活方式。当农民有可能离开他们的茅屋，工人有可能搬出贫民窟，并且获得新的生活条件的时候，他们就会放弃原先只适合于茅屋和贫民窟的生活方式，而采取新的生活方式。传统的影响会存在，但是它不可避免地要被新的和更新的一代所不断削弱，并为新的传统所代替。这个变化是如此紧密地同经济关系的变化联系着，以致任何经济以外的力量不能强迫它突然出现。醉心欧化的彼得曾经企图用他的作为沙皇的权力改变俄罗斯民族生活中的一切，但是，他到底只是在俄国的上层社会中变出一些“近似欧洲人的貌合神离的歪文”（别林斯基），广大的俄国农奴没有得到解放，他们的生活不能不停留在原先的老地方。近代中国的资产阶级革命家以模仿欧洲人改变自己的生活方式为革命的标志，但是他们没有，也不可能，在广大群众中实现同样的改变。群众在使自己从贫困中摆脱出来以前，不能不继续采取传统的贫困的生活方式。
    中国人民革命的伟大胜利从根本上改变了中国社会的生产方式，从而也在很大程度上改变了中国人民的生活方式。沸腾的革命斗争和集体的生产组织使人们在生活上日益趋于接近。但是油盐柴米仍然各自为谋，并且是群众生活中的主要的事务。人民公社化以后，广大农村居民的生活方式开始达到了一个根本性的改变。大部分居住分散的人们按照生产和生活的需要建立了居民点。公共食堂、幼儿园和敬老院的成立，使妇女得到了真正的解放。他们走出了往往是狭小的、浓烟充塞的厨房，摆脱了数不清的家务琐事，同他们的丈夫，他们的家庭的其他成员，以及他们的邻人，一起参加生产组织，并直接取得自己的一份口粮和工资。由于这个变化，妇女第一次真正成了社会的独立的一员，丈夫也更像一个丈夫，而不是一个家长了。
    群众习惯这个新的生活吗？帝国主义分子和国内外资产阶级分子设想他们是不能习惯的。但是，事实同这些人所想像的完全相反，除了旧日的地主富农和一部分富裕中农以外，绝大多数群众很快就习惯了。他们欢迎新生活，在新生活中感受到了真正的愉快，因为他们在公共的大家庭中，失去的仅仅是他们的家庭生活的负担。现在不但生活得到了最坚固的保障，而且水平大大提高了。他们领了工资，完全可以按照自己的需要支配，因此，消费水平也大大提高了。在国民党统治时代，中国的农民曾经是衣衫褴褛的，现在非常罕见了。群众对于发生在他们自己身上和他们周围的这样巨大的变化充满了感激的心情。他们爱护他们所成就和所获得的一切。在许多农村的新建的居民点和公共食堂里面，群众的自觉精神和高尚风气证明新的生活方式已经确立了。
    这个伟大的现象的出现是生产方式的改变必然要达到的结果。农民拥护社会主义生产方式，自然也就拥护为社会主义生产方式所要求的生活方式。要反对这个趋势是不可能的。
    有些外国的所谓“中国通”用他们在清末和在国民党时代得到的关于中国的一点可怜的知识来看新中国的事事物物，总认为中国的农民不会变得那么快，他们还会留恋那个贫困和饥饿的旧时代，会舍不得那些供奉在破茅屋里的祖宗牌位，舍不得附近庙里的菩萨。不，事实不是这样的。礼拜菩萨，对农民来说，本是与贫穷分不开的。他们在无法摆脱贫穷的时候，只好去求菩萨保佑。而一旦认识自己就是摆脱贫困的力量，他们就失去对那些泥塑木雕的偶像的最后一点敬意了。毛泽东
  同志还在1927年就已经指出：“菩萨是农民立起来的，到了一定时期农民会用他们自己的双手丢开这些菩萨，无须旁人过早地代庖丢菩萨。”事实正是如此，农民用他们自己的双手把菩萨丢了。现在在农村中已经很难看到迷信的痕迹。什么“关圣帝君”、“杨四将军”、“钟馗进士”、“城隍”、“土地”一类的毛神野怪一齐烟消火灭。所有的祠堂都已经改造成了公共集会和办公的场所。人们对于这些场所的本来面目的记忆已经非常淡薄了。只有极少数四十岁以上的人才能讲出发生在这些场所的一些故事。可是这些故事全是地主恶霸欺压农民的血和泪的故事。提起它们，除了引起憎恨以外，决不唤起对于旧时代的任何留恋。中国的农民迷信吗？他们不迷信。在没有觉悟的时候，他们信很多神，看来是迷信的；在觉悟以后，一个神都不信。事实就是这样。
    现在在农村成年人口中占多数和在生产中成为主要力量的是青年。他们是一代新人。正是他们，创造了当代的伟大的奇迹，实现了农业生产的大跃进。在他们身上显著地存在着的传统是中国劳动人民的勤劳勇敢。他们是社会主义新生活的建设者。他们适应并且爱好这个新的生活方式，将来他们还会把它改造得更美好。美国“新闻周刊”在1959年10月12日发表的一篇文章慨叹说：“共产党的社会改革已无可挽回地改变了中国的生活方式。”是的，这个改变是无可挽回的，让那些想把中国“挽回”到旧时代去的蠢汉们为他们自己的无可挽回的失败而悲哀吧。
