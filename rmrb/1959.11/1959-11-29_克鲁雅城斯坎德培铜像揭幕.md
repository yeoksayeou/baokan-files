Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 27th: To celebrate the 15th anniversary of Albania's liberation, a grand unveiling ceremony of the statue of Albania's national hero, Skanderbeg, was held in Krujë today.

The national hero Skanderbeg (1403-1468) bravely led the Albanian people in their resistance against the Turkish invaders. In 1443, they conquered Krujë and established an independent Albanian regime. The city still retains the castle from that time. The bronze statue, depicting Skanderbeg riding a horse, stands in the center of this ancient city.

First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Hoxha, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Shehu, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly, Leshi, and other party and state leaders attended the unveiling ceremony.

At the unveiling ceremony, the Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Defense of Albania, General Baluku, spoke, introducing the history of Skanderbeg's heroic struggle. He said that our party is the inheritor of the excellent revolutionary traditions of our people. He then spoke about the resolute struggle of the Albanian Labor Party against the outrageous interference of the anti-Marxist-Leninist Yugoslav revisionist group. He said that the Yugoslav revisionists have carried out actions against our country. The Belgrade revisionists are frantic revisionists and anti-Marxist-Leninists who serve imperialism, and our party will never cease its struggle against Yugoslav revisionism.

Recently, as the 15th anniversary of liberation approaches, people all over Albania have been erecting monuments or busts to patriots who fought for national independence and martyrs who died in the struggle to liberate the motherland. Some places have also built memorial halls for the martyrs.

    民族英雄斯坎德培（1403年—1468年）曾英勇地领导了阿尔巴尼亚人民抗击土耳其侵略者。1443年他们攻克了克鲁雅城，并建立了阿尔巴尼亚人的独立政权。至今该城还遗有当时的城堡。刻划斯坎德培骑在马上的英姿的铜像，树立在这一古城中心。

    在揭幕式上，阿尔巴尼亚部长会议副主席、国防部长巴卢库上将讲了话，他介绍了斯坎德培英勇斗争的历史。他说，我们的党是我国人民优良革命传统的继承者。他接着谈到阿尔巴尼亚劳动党为反对反马克思列宁主义的南斯拉夫修正主义集团的横暴干涉而进行的坚决斗争。他说，南斯拉夫修正主义者进行了反对我国的行动。贝尔格莱德修正主义者是为帝国主义服务的疯狂的修正主义者和反马克思列宁主义者，我们的党永远不停止对南斯拉夫修正主义的斗争。
    近来，在解放十五周年即将来临的日子里，阿尔巴尼亚各地人民纷纷为争取民族独立的爱国者和解放祖国斗争中的烈士们树立纪念碑或半身像，有的地方并为烈士们建造了纪念馆。
