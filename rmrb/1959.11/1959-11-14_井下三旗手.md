Three Banners Underground

    Be a Good Master of the Electric Conveyor

The electric conveyor is the main equipment for transporting coal in the underground coal mining face. The mined coal must be transported by the electric conveyor to the main roadway, loaded onto mine cars, and then pulled by electric locomotives or endless rope to the bottom yard of the mine and hoisted to the surface. Therefore, everyone calls the electric conveyor the "throat" in the coal mining production process.

Song Shaoxian, the transportation team leader of the No. 72 coal mining area of Kailuan Zhao Gezhuang Coal Mine, has diligently studied and fully mastered the performance of the electric conveyor. In July of this year, he sorted out his rich experience in ensuring the normal operation of the electric conveyor over the past few years, analyzed the twenty common causes of accidents with the electric conveyor, and proposed prevention and treatment methods, writing a booklet entitled "How to Be a Good Master of the Electric Conveyor."

The electric conveyors used by Song Shaoxian have basically eliminated accidents lasting more than thirty minutes since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. From January to September of this year, the cumulative accident time of the fourteen electric conveyors they used did not exceed one hundred minutes per month. The monthly output of the working face averaged 30,000 tons, more than three times the national average monthly output of working faces during the same period this year.

Before attending the National Congress of Heroes, Song Shaoxian participated in the advanced experience observation and dissemination team organized by the Ministry of Coal Industry and the National Coal Mine Trade Union, and went to coal mines in Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi provinces and Jingxi to observe and disseminate advanced experience, helping many brother units solve the difficulties of electric conveyors not being able to operate normally. After Song Shaoxian's on-site demonstration, the entire Hebi No. 2 Mine promoted his experience, and the electric conveyor accidents in September decreased by 83% compared to August. People call "Old Song a good doctor for electric conveyors."

    All-Purpose Prop Retriever

In coal mining work, retrieving props and releasing rock roof is an extremely important process. After coal is mined from the coal mining face, props are used to support the rock roof to protect workers and machinery. After the working face advances a certain distance, the props must be removed for reuse, and the rock roof must be collapsed to reduce the pressure on the front coal mining face. If this work is not done well, it will not only waste a large amount of timber but also affect the smooth progress of coal mining.

Among the more than 50,000 miners in the Kailuan mining area, everyone knows that Zhang Wen from Zhao Gezhuang Mine is an all-purpose prop retriever. He and his team have diligently studied and learned modestly over the years, and have successively created and summarized eight advanced prop retrieval methods based on the different conditions of the coal mining face. No matter how severely the rock roof of the coal mining face is broken or how great the pressure is, they can almost always retrieve the timber props. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the timber recovery rate of this team has increased from 80% to 98%, saving the country more than 2,000 cubic meters of timber, while ensuring the safe operation and continuous high production of the coal mining face. Thus, they have become a red banner in the national coal mine prop retrieval work.

    Achieved Rapid Tunneling

Under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, the employees of the Zhuang Hongsheng Tunneling Team of the Hanqiao Coal Mine of the Xuzhou Mining Bureau in Jiangsu Province fully demonstrated the communist style of daring to think and daring to act last year, and successively created records of advancing more than 1,000 meters per month, and the amount of tunneling in one year was equivalent to the amount of tunneling in the past one year and seven months. Since the beginning of this year, especially under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all the comrades in the team have been more energetic and put forward the resounding slogan of "speeding up tunneling and preparing more working faces for coal mining." After careful analysis and research, they unanimously believed that deepening the boreholes was the key to rapid tunneling. In order to achieve deep-hole blasting, everyone proposed a technical innovation proposal to try using six-meter-long drill rods. With the strong support of party and government leaders at all levels and the close cooperation of engineering and technical personnel, they finally succeeded in the experiment. Using a six-meter-long drill rod to drill holes, one blast can collapse five to six meters, and with the implementation of pre-shift material preparation, rectification of labor organization, and the cooperation of transportation workers, the tunneling speed increased from 11 meters per day in the past to more than 24 meters. By the end of September, they had completed the annual tunneling plan three months ahead of schedule.

The Zhuang Hongsheng rapid tunneling team participated in the National Coal Mine Advanced Experience Observation and Dissemination Team and went to Xinwen, Zaozhuang, Pingdingshan, Hebi, Fengfeng, Xishan, Jingxi and other mining areas to perform on-site. After many units learned their advanced experience, the tunneling speed has been increased by one to two and a half times, and the consumption of gunpowder and detonators has also been relatively reduced.

    井下三旗手
    当好电溜子的主人
    电溜子是井下采煤工作面运煤的主要设备，采出的煤炭必须经过电溜子载运到大巷，装上矿车，再由电机车或无极绳拉到井底车场，提升到地面。所以大家都把电溜子称为采煤生产过程中的“嗓子眼”。
    开滦赵各庄煤矿七二采煤区运煤队长宋绍先刻苦钻研，充分掌握了电溜子的性能。今年7月，他整理了几年来在保证电溜子正常运转方面的丰富经验，分析了电溜子经常发生事故的二十种原因，提出预防和处理的方法，写成了一本“怎样当好电溜子的主人”的小册子。
    宋绍先所使用的电溜子，从1958年大跃进以来，已经基本上消灭了三十分钟以上的事故。今年1至9月份他们使用的十四部电溜子，每个月的电溜子事故累计时间不超过一百分钟。工作面的月产量平均达到三万吨，比今年同期全国工作面的平均月产量，超过三倍多。
    宋绍先在参加全国群英会前，曾参加煤炭工业部和全国煤矿工会组织的先进经验观摩传播队，到山东、河南、河北、山西省和京西等煤矿观摩、传播先进经验，帮助不少兄弟单位解决了电溜子不能正常运转的困难。鹤壁二矿经过宋绍先实地表演后，全矿推广了他的经验，9月份的电溜子事故比8月份减少了83％。人们都称“老宋是电溜子的好医生”。
    万能回柱手
    在采煤工作中，回柱和放落岩石顶板是一道极其重要的工序。采煤工作面内采出煤炭之后，要用支柱撑住岩石顶板来保护工人和机械设备的安全。当工作面向前推进一定距离之后，又要把支柱撤掉，再行利用，并使岩石顶板塌落下来，减轻前面采煤工作面所受的压力。如果这项工作作不好，不仅大量浪费坑木，而且影响采煤工作的顺利进行。
    在开滦矿区五万多名矿工中，谁都知道赵各庄矿的张文是一个万能回柱手。他和他的小组，几年来刻苦钻研，虚心学习，根据采煤工作面不同的条件，先后创造和总结了八种先进的回柱方法。不管采煤工作面的岩石顶板破碎得怎样厉害，压力怎么大，他们几乎没有回撤不出来的坑木。1958年大跃进以来，这个小组的坑木回收率由80％提高到98％，为国家节约了坑木二千多立方米，同时保证了采煤工作面的安全作业，持续高产。因而成了全国煤矿回柱工作的一面红旗。
　　实现了快速掘进
    江苏省徐州矿务局韩桥煤矿庄洪生掘进组职工，去年在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，充分发挥了敢想、敢干的共产主义风格，曾经连续创造月进千米以上的纪录，一年的掘进量相当于过去一年零七个月的掘进量。今年以来，特别是在党的八届八中全会的号召下，全组同志更加鼓足干劲，提出了“加快掘进速度，为采煤准备更多工作面”的响亮口号。经过认真分析研究，一致认为加深炮孔是快速掘进的关键。为了实现深孔爆破，大家提出了试用六米长钎子的技术革新建议。在各级党政领导的大力支持和工程技术人员的密切配合下，终于试验成功了。用六米长的钎子打眼，放一次炮就能崩进五米到六米，再加上实行了班前带料、整顿劳动组织和在运输工人的协作下，掘进进度由过去日进十一米提高到二十四米以上。到9月末，他们已提前三个月完成了全年的掘进计划。
    庄洪生快速掘进组曾经参加全国煤矿先进经验观摩传播队，先后到新汶、枣庄、平顶山、鹤壁、峰峰、西山、京西等矿区进行现场表演。很多单位学习了他们的先进经验后，掘进进度都提高了一倍到两倍半，火药和雷管的消耗也相对地降低了。
