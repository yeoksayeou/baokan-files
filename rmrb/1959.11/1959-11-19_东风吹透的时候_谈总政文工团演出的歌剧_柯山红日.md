    When the East Wind Blows Through

    ——On the Opera "Red Sun on Mount Ke" Performed by the General Political Department Cultural Troupe
    Ma Shaobo
    In the years 1955 and 1956, a small number of reactionary slave owners in the Tibetan areas of Ganzi, Sichuan, in the eastern part of the Kham-Tibet Plateau, in order to maintain their dark rule, obeyed the reactionary groups of the upper Tibetan class and provoked the so-called "Khampa rebellion". They burned, killed, looted, and did everything, seriously endangering the safety of the lives and property of the local Tibetan people and seriously violating the laws of the country. The Tibetan people were not intimidated by the bloody crimes of the rebel elements. They rose up to resist and cooperated with the heroic People's Liberation Army to quell the rebellion in a short period of time, began democratic reforms, and resolutely and jubilantly built a happy socialist homeland.
    The new opera "Red Sun on Mount Ke," performed by the Opera Troupe of the General Political Department Cultural Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and written and directed by Comrade Chen Qitong, reflects this historical event. It should be said that "Red Sun on Mount Ke" not only profoundly exposed the truth of the specific event of the "Khampa rebellion," showing the infinite patience of the people of the motherland over a long period of time and the powerful force to quell the rebellion in order to maintain the dignity and security of the motherland; but also provided people with a microcosm of the Tibetan upper reactionary elements launching armed rebellions and the motherland resolutely quelling the rebellion, implementing democratic reforms in the Tibetan region, smashing the dark slave system, and embarking on the socialist road. From this, people can clearly see what system is harmful to mankind and what system benefits mankind. Shouldn't we completely destroy the sinful slave system? Can we turn a blind eye to the suffering of the Tibetan people and tolerate the crazy evil deeds of a few reactionary elements? Don't we hope and guarantee that our people will embark on the road to a free and happy life? The author revealed such a righteous and loud theme, which is undoubtedly significant.
    The Central People's Government and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have always resolutely implemented the policy of national unity. Since the founding of the country, in order to unite the majority and hope for the transformation of some upper reactionary elements, we would rather wait patiently for many years; but under intolerable circumstances, resolutely quelling the rebellion and implementing democratic reforms is to safeguard the unification of the motherland, and of course, also to safeguard national unity. In a class society, national unity cannot be separated from the foundation of class struggle. Facts have proved that it is precisely by resolutely quelling the rebellion of the upper reactionary elements in Tibet and destroying the slave system that the unification of the motherland has been truly safeguarded and national unity has been consolidated. The author's incorporation of this red line into the work makes it particularly real, profound, persuasive, and moving.
    "Red Sun on Mount Ke" reflects the reality of history. But it is not a general record of life; it is a higher and more concentrated generalization of life, a more typical description of events and characters. In the author's writing, the characters are numerous and the relationships are complex. It is rare that each character is so vivid, and it is rare that each line is so clear despite the complex relationships. Among them are senior commanders of the People's Liberation Army, female doctors, engineers, battalion commanders, communicators, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army; a high-aged blind artist with strong revolutionary enthusiasm, revolutionary young male and female slaves, and kind and brave Tibetan people; in addition to the Tusi, there are also special agents of the reactionary groups of the Tibetan Kashag who are hiding in Keluyade's house to carry out sabotage activities... Among these characters, an extremely complex and acute struggle between good and evil, revolution and counter-revolution is formed. When the author expresses this struggle, his love and hate are exceptionally clear, and the whole article is filled with the spirit of revolutionary heroism, high morale, and excitement.
    The directing and singing are also excellent. Their attempts to learn from the traditions of national opera are also relatively successful. It is rare for the General Political Department Opera Troupe to have so many excellent singers, all of whom sing well and perform well! Soprano Zhang Yuenan played the female doctor, contralto Wang Shuhui played Jialuo Jia, and bass Li Bing played the blind artist, which were particularly wonderful. Their singing is not only good at expressing the most delicate emotions; but also has a broad and bright voice, clear pronunciation, and is rich in performance skills. Generally speaking, it is relatively easy for singers to achieve a rounded tone; it is rare to have a rounded tone and correct pronunciation, and to have both correct pronunciation and strength. The singing of the new opera not only pays attention to rhymes and rhythms, but also pays attention to the distinction between sharp and round sounds and the four tones, and dares to fully use percussion instruments. It is rare to see something like "Red Sun on Mount Ke."
    In terms of directing, some detailed research and bold attempts have been made in the use of opera performance programs. Obviously, the performance of this play uses many traditional opera performance methods, such as the sense of rhythm of emotion, action and language, the plastic beauty and stability of body movements, and the use of eyes and mouth strength, which make the performance much more colorful. So to achieve such good results, I think it is not only in daring to try, but more importantly in being good at using it. The correct use of traditional techniques must start from the characteristics of life and characters, and integrate traditional expression techniques into the role in a harmonious manner, so as to achieve a natural and harmonious state. The author and director dare to use the types of roles of the opera's "Sheng, Dan, Jing, Mo, Chou" to deal with the roles of the new opera, making the characters stand out and be vivid, which is the result of daring to try and being good at integrating.
    The art design, although basically still a drama-style scale; but it has begun to break through the frame of "four walls." It seems that the wall behind the stage is still concrete, but from the performance of the actors, the three walls in front of the stage and on both sides have been pushed down, which greatly expands the space of the performance environment, which is very beneficial for the performance.
    The form and structure of the script, as well as the dialogue and lyrics, appropriately absorb many of the strengths of opera screenwriting methods, which are also quite ingenious.
    Speaking of shortcomings, I personally think:
    1.  The handling of the scenes, that is, the organization of contradictions, is too tight, so that the audience does not have a chance to breathe. Although the struggle itself is unusually tense; in artistic treatment, if the tension and relaxation, movement and stillness are properly arranged to complement each other and set each other off, it will better highlight the tension of life contradictions.
    2.  The ending handles the female doctor as finally sacrificing herself. This is of course very good in the author's intention, in order to give the audience room for aftertaste and deep memory, and it does not fall into the old routine in form; however, this play is not a tragedy after all, but a description of the great victory of the people's revolution. Then, how to further enhance its inspirational power should be the most important aspect. Finally, in the midst of triumphant songs, a most concerned female protagonist is sacrificed, and a dying elegy, a corpse lying across the stage. At this time, no matter how the red flag is flying and how loud the singing is, people will always leave the theater with a direct feeling of regret and regret. This mood will of course also produce an exciting artistic effect, but this is only an individual effect, which will directly dilute the effect of the joyful and encouraging emotions that must be emphasized at the end. If you look at the effect from the character of this play, you can't help but think that this treatment will have an adverse effect on the overall effect.
    The success of "Red Sun on Mount Ke" is certain, and it is another new pearl in the opera world of our country in the Great Leap Forward. When the east wind blows through, the red sun rises brightly! It symbolizes that no villain wants to stop the wheel of historical progress; it symbolizes that the red light of communism will surely illuminate any dark corner!

    东风吹透的时候
    ——谈总政文工团演出的歌剧“柯山红日”
    马少波
    在1955年到1956年间，康藏高原东部四川甘孜一带藏族地区的少数反动奴隶主为了保持他们黑暗的统治，听命于西藏上层反动集团，挑起了所谓“康巴叛乱”。他们烧杀抢掠，无所不为，严重地危害了当地藏族人民生命财产的安全，严重地违犯了国家的法纪。藏族人民并没有被叛乱分子的血腥罪行吓倒，他们纷纷起来反抗，配合英勇的人民解放军，在短期内就平息了叛乱，并开始进行民主改革，坚决地欢欣鼓舞地建设社会主义的幸福家园。
    中国人民解放军总政文工团歌剧团演出、陈其通同志编导的新歌剧“柯山红日”，就是反映了这一个历史事件。应该说，“柯山红日”不但深刻地揭露了“康巴叛乱”这一具体事件的真相，表现了祖国人民在一个很长时间内的无比耐心和为了保持祖国的尊严和安全而平息叛乱的强大威力；而且为人们提供了一个西藏上层反动分子发动武装叛乱和祖国坚决平息叛乱、在西藏地区实行民主改革、粉碎了黑暗的奴隶制度走上社会主义道路的缩影。从这里人们可以清楚地看到什么制度对人类有害；什么制度为人类造福。难道我们不应该把罪恶的奴隶制度彻底摧毁吗？难道我们能够对藏族人民受苦受难熟视无睹，而容忍少数反动分子疯狂地作恶吗？难道我们不希望和保障我们的人民走向自由幸福的生活道路吗？作者揭示了这样义正词严的主题，无疑是重大而响亮的。
    中央人民政府和中国人民解放军一贯是坚决执行民族团结政策的。建国以来，为了团结大多数并希冀某些上层反动分子的转变，宁可仁至义尽地等待多少年；但是在忍无可忍的情况下，坚决平息叛乱，实行民主改革，是为了维护祖国统一，当然也正是为了维护民族团结。在阶级社会中，民族团结不可能离开阶级斗争的基础。事实证明，正是坚决平息了西藏上层反动分子的叛乱，摧毁了奴隶制度，才真正维护了祖国的统一，巩固了民族的团结。作者在作品中贯串了这条红线，就特别显得真实、深刻，富有说服人和感动人的力量。
    “柯山红日”反映的是历史的真实。但它不是一般的生活记录；它是更高更集中地概括了生活，更典型地描写了事件和人物。在作者笔下，人物是众多的，关系是复杂的。人物众多，难得个个形象如此鲜明；关系复杂，难得每条线路如此清楚。这里面有解放军的高级指挥员，有部队的女医生、工程师、营长、通讯员和解放军战士；有抱着强烈革命热情的高龄的盲艺人，有富有革命性的男女青年奴隶，有善良勇敢的藏族群众；除土司外，还有隐藏在柯陆亚德家里进行破坏活动的西藏噶厦中反动集团的特务分子……在这些人物中间，构成了善与恶、革命与反革命的极其复杂尖锐的斗争。作者在表现这一斗争的时候，爱憎异常鲜明，全篇洋溢着革命英雄主义的精神气概，斗志昂扬，激动人心。
    在导演和演唱方面，也是出色的。他们向民族戏曲传统学习所作的尝试，也是比较成功的。总政歌剧团难得拥有这么多的优秀的歌唱家，个个唱得好，演得也好！女高音张越男饰演女医生，女低音王淑蕙饰演加洛呷，男低音李冰饰演盲艺人，特别精彩。他们的歌唱不仅善于表现最细致的感情；而且嗓音宽亮，字正腔圆，富有表现技巧。一般说来，歌唱家作到腔圆比较容易；腔圆而字正，字正而有劲，是难能可贵的。新歌剧的歌唱，不仅注重辙口、节奏，而且讲究尖团、四声，并敢于充分运用敲击乐器，像“柯山红日”这样，还是不多见的。
    在导演方面，对于戏曲表演程式的运用，进行了若干细致的研究和大胆的尝试。很明显，这个戏的表演，运用了不少的戏曲传统的表演方法，比如感情、动作和语言的节奏感、身段的塑形美、稳定感以及眼神和口劲的运用，都使演出生色不少。所以达到这样好的成就，我想不只是在敢于尝试，更重要的是在善于运用。正确的运用传统技术，必须从生活和人物的特点出发，将传统表现技术，水乳交融地溶合于角色之中，达到自然和谐的境界。作者、导演敢于以戏曲的生、旦、净、末、丑的行当类型来处理新歌剧的角色，使人物形象突出鲜明，正是敢于尝试而又善于溶合的结果。
    美术设计，虽然基本上还是话剧式的规模；但是已经开始突破了“四堵墙”的框框，看来台上后面的一堵墙还是具体的，可是，从演员的表演来看，把台前和两侧的三堵墙都推倒了，这就大大扩展了表演环境的空间，对于表演有很大好处。
    剧本的形式、结构以至话白、唱词，都适当地吸收了戏曲编剧方法的许多长处，也是颇见匠心。
    谈到缺点，我个人认为：
    一、场子的处理，也就是矛盾的组织，绷得过紧，使观众没有一点松口气的机会。虽说斗争本身就是异常紧张的；但在艺术处理上，如果紧与弛、动与静安排得当，使之交相辉映，相互衬托，就会更突出生活矛盾的紧张。
    二、结尾把女医生处理成终于牺牲。这在作者的意图固然是很好的，是为了给观众以回味余地和深刻的记忆，在形式上也不落旧套；可是，这个戏毕竟不是悲剧，而是描写人民革命的伟大胜利，那末，如何更增强其鼓舞的力量，应该是最重要的方面。最后，在凯歌声中，一个最被人关怀的女主人公牺牲了，临终悲歌，一尸横陈。这时候，无论红旗如何飘扬，歌声如何嘹亮，人们总是要直感地抱着惋惜和遗憾的心情走出剧场的。这种心情当然也会产生激动人心的艺术效果，但这只是个别性质的效果，是会直接冲淡结尾所必须强调的欢欣鼓舞情绪的效果。如果从这个戏的性格看效果，就不能不认为这种处理，对总的效果会产生不利的影响。
    “柯山红日”的成功，是肯定的，它是我国歌剧界在大跃进中又一颗新的珍珠。当东风吹透的时候，红日艳艳地升起了！它象征着任何恶人也休想挡住历史前进的车轮；它象征着共产主义的红光，一定会照亮任何黑暗的角落！
