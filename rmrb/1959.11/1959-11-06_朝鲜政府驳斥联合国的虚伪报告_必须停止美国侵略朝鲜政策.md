Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 4th: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today issued a memorandum refuting the ninth annual "Report" of the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea." The memorandum points out that "this 'Commission's' 'report', like those it has submitted to the United Nations in the past, is entirely devoted to covering up the aggressive policies of the United States and slandering and defaming the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."

The memorandum states that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea considers it necessary to expose the hypocritical nature of the report presented by the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" so that the representatives of the United Nations General Assembly may have a correct understanding of the illegal nature of this "Commission" and the actual situation in Korea.

The memorandum first refutes the fallacy of this "Commission" attempting to shift the responsibility for the failure to achieve Korean unification to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The memorandum states that past historical facts clearly prove that the continuing division of Korea is the responsibility of the American imperialists and their lackey, the Syngman Rhee clique, who continue to occupy South Korea.

The memorandum describes the consistent and sincere efforts made by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the peaceful reunification of the fatherland at an early date, despite the continued obstruction of the American imperialists. The memorandum states that, in order to promote a new situation for the peaceful reunification of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on February 5th of last year, advocating the simultaneous withdrawal of all foreign troops, including US troops and the Chinese People's Volunteers, from North and South Korea, and proposed that free elections be held throughout Korea within a certain period of time after the withdrawal of foreign troops. Consultations should be held between North and South Korea on economic and cultural exchanges and the election of the whole of Korea. The memorandum states that the Chinese People's Volunteers took the initiative to withdraw from Korea in October of last year, but the United States, using the "United Nations resolution" as an excuse, refused to withdraw its troops and continues to occupy South Korea.

The memorandum points out that because the United Nations, from the very beginning, took a one-sided position on the Korean issue under the pressure of the United States, it is completely incapable of peacefully resolving the Korean issue and has lost its moral authority. The United Nations, as one of the belligerents in the Korean War, signed the armistice agreement, which proves that the United Nations cannot take a fair position on the Korean issue. Therefore, we resolutely denounce the United Nations' "resolution on Korea" as a matter of course.

The memorandum states that, contrary to what this "report" states, the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique have consistently violated the armistice agreement. From the time the armistice agreement was signed on July 27, 1953, to October 14, 1959, the Korean-Chinese side formally presented 863 cases of hostile acts committed by the US side. The American imperialists also expanded the South Korean puppet troops from sixteen divisions at the time of the armistice to thirty-one divisions. The US side also unilaterally expelled the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from South Korea and unilaterally abolished Article 13D of the armistice agreement regarding the prohibition of the introduction of reinforcement combat materials, and illegally introduced new weapons such as atomic cannons and missiles into South Korea. The memorandum states that all this shows that the responsibility for the failure to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea lies entirely with the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique. The memorandum points out that this "report" also tries to portray South Korea as having begun to have democracy under parliamentary politics. The memorandum exposes this lie, saying that the Syngman Rhee "regime," created under the guns of American imperialism, is an anti-people fascist group serving the colonial and war policies of imperialism. Last year, 240,000 people were arrested and imprisoned in South Korea by the Syngman Rhee clique. The Syngman Rhee clique also suppressed public opinion and closed down dozens of newspapers and periodicals this year, including the "Kyonghyang Shinmun."

The memorandum also states that under the colonial enslavement of the United States, South Korea's economy is increasingly in crisis. South Korea, which was once known as a granary, has now become a chronic hunger zone.

The memorandum states that the root cause of the suffering of the South Korean people and the national misfortune suffered by the entire Korean people due to the division of the country lies in the US imperialist occupation of South Korea. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that the United Nations should stop using the policies used by US imperialism to implement aggression against Korea, and the US aggressive troops disguised as the "United Nations Army" must be withdrawn from South Korea immediately, and measures must be taken to dissolve the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" immediately.

    朝鲜政府驳斥联合国的虚伪报告
    必须停止美国侵略朝鲜政策
    新华社平壤4日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府今天发表备忘录，驳斥“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会”第九次年次“报告”。备忘录指出，“这个‘委员会’的‘报告’同它过去向联合国所提出过的一样，它全部的内容是在掩饰美国的侵略政策，对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行诽谤和中伤。”
    备忘录说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为，有必要揭露“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会”所提出的报告的虚伪性质，以便联合国大会代表对这个“委员会”的非法的性质和朝鲜的实际情况有正确的了解。
    备忘录首先驳斥了这个“委员会”企图把朝鲜的统一至今未能实现的责任转嫁给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的谬论。备忘录说，过去的历史事实清楚地证明，朝鲜的分裂局面持续至今，其责任在于继续强占着南朝鲜的美帝国主义和它的走狗李承晚集团。
    备忘录叙述了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府不顾美帝国主义继续阻挠，为早日实现祖国的和平统一所进行的始终一贯的有诚意的努力。备忘录说，特别是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为了促进朝鲜的和平统一打开新的局面，在去年2月5日发表声明，主张包括美军和中国人民志愿军在内的一切外国军队同时撤出南北朝鲜，并且建议在外国军队撤出后的一定时间内实行全朝鲜的自由选举。为了讨论南北朝鲜间的经济文化交流和全朝鲜的选举问题，南北朝鲜间进行协商。备忘录说，中国人民志愿军已主动地在去年10月撤出了朝鲜，但美国却以“联合国的决议”为借口拒绝撤出自己的军队，继续强占着南朝鲜。
    备忘录指出，由于联合国对于朝鲜问题从一开始就在美国的压力下采取了片面的立场，它对于朝鲜问题的和平调整完全无能为力，丧失了道义上的权威，联合国已作为朝鲜战争的交战一方在停战协议上签了字，这一切证明联合国对于朝鲜问题已不可能采取公正的立场。因此，我们坚决斥责联合国的“关于朝鲜的决议”是理所当然的。
    备忘录说，同这份“报告”所说的完全相反，美国和李承晚集团一贯地违反停战协定。从1953年7月27日停战协定签字时起到1959年10月14日为止，仅朝中方面正式提出的美方进行的敌对行为就达八百六十三起，美帝国主义者还把南朝鲜伪军由停战时的十六个师扩大到三十一个师，美方还片面地把中立国视察小组逐出南朝鲜，片面废除停战协定关于禁止运入增援性作战物资的十三款卯项的规定，把原子大炮、导弹等新型武器非法运入南朝鲜。备忘录说，这一切说明，朝鲜的和平统一未能实现的责任完全在于美帝国主义和李承晚集团。备忘录指出，这份“报告”还努力把南朝鲜说成在议会制的政治下开始有了民主。备忘录揭露这一谎言说，在美帝国主义的枪刀之下制造出来的李承晚“政权”是为帝国主义的殖民政策和战争政策服务的和反人民的法西斯集团。去年一年在南朝鲜有二十四万人被李承晚集团逮捕下狱。李承晚集团还压制舆论，今年封闭了“京乡新闻”等数十种报刊。
    备忘录还说，在美国殖民地奴役下，南朝鲜的经济日益陷入危机。过去曾以粮仓闻名的南朝鲜今天已变为慢性饥饿地区。
    备忘录说，南朝鲜人民遭受痛苦和全体朝鲜人民因国家被分裂而受到民族不幸的根源在于美帝国主义强占南朝鲜。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国认为，联合国应该停止被美帝国主义用来实行侵略朝鲜的政策，必须立即使伪装为“联合国军”的美国侵略军撤出南朝鲜，必须采取措施立即解散“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会”。
