    The Rebirth of the Mountain Region
    Jiang Xiang
    Tropoja is a mountainous region in northern Albania. During the reign of the feudal dynasty, it was the most economically and culturally backward area in all of Albania. The entire region was surrounded by towering mountains. Backward agriculture and primitive animal husbandry were the only forms of economy in this area, and the mountain people lived a life of hunger and cold. For centuries, due to transportation barriers, it was as if this place was isolated from the world. People had to travel to Shkodër City, two hundred kilometers away, to buy even the smallest of daily necessities. Before liberation, there were eleven primary schools with more than five hundred students, but they were almost entirely the "private schools" of landlords and rich peasants. More than 85% of the residents in the region were illiterate. Even so, the ruling class at the time repeatedly clamored that Albania had too many intellectuals. The sanitation situation was even more backward. There wasn't a single doctor, not a single hospital, let alone maternity hospitals, nurseries, or kindergartens in the entire region. Death constantly threatened the lives of the mountain people. However, the remoteness of the mountains did not prevent the exploitation of the feudal dynasty, nor did it prevent the exploitation of landlords and rich peasants. Three-quarters of the hard-earned income of the mountain people went into their pockets every year. In addition, they had to provide unpaid labor for them. No wonder people often said, "In the rural areas of Tropoja, other than gendarmes and tax collectors, there were never any traces of anyone else." Poverty, hunger, and ignorance – this was the general picture of the Tropoja mountain region.
    Tropoja fifteen years ago was also a microcosm of Albania before liberation.
    Was Tropoja really so poor? No, not at all. It has fertile land, good climatic conditions, and is very suitable for the development of agriculture and fruit growing. It has beautiful grasslands and natural pastures, which open up broad prospects for the development of animal husbandry. It has abundant mineral resources, especially chromite ore.
    Were the people of Tropoja willing to endure such cruel exploitation? No, as early as 1918, they had already launched a struggle against the rulers under the leadership of the local national hero, Bajram Curri. During the democratic revolution of 1920-1924, the mountain people of Tropoja fought bravely all the way to Tirana against the rule of the Zogu dynasty. Subsequently, the people of Tropoja actively participated in the national liberation struggle, and like mountain eagles, they fought alongside guerrillas across the country.
    After liberation, the people of Tropoja inherited the glorious revolutionary tradition and carried out socialist construction in the mountains with great enthusiasm, giving the mountain region a completely new look. Today, large trucks loaded with various daily necessities travel constantly on the highway leading to Tropoja, in order to meet the growing needs of the mountain people.
    Tropoja's agriculture and animal husbandry have broken away from their primitive and backward state. The peasants, now masters of their own destiny, actively responded to the Party's call and embarked on the road of agricultural collectivization. There are now twenty-seven agricultural cooperatives in the region, with cultivated land accounting for 53% of the total area and peasant households accounting for 41.5%. Nature has been revived, the roar of tractors resounds through the fields and valleys, and agriculture has undergone tremendous development. The cultivated land area in the region has increased from 1,420 hectares in 1938 to 2,294 hectares in 1958, and the irrigated area has increased from 40% to 80% of the cultivated land area. Grain production has greatly exceeded that before liberation. In 1958, the average yield of corn per hectare in the region reached twenty quintals. Now, the Tropoja region has jumped from a grain-deficient area to a surplus grain area, which is a great victory achieved by the people of Tropoja under the leadership of the Party.
    The development of fruit growing has brought more income to the mountain people. Today, thanks to the construction of highways, the problem of fruit transportation has been solved, greatly promoting fruit production. In 1938, there were only 20,000 fruit trees in the region, but now they have increased dramatically to 400,000, producing 20,000 tons of fruit annually. Calculated per capita, the average person in the region can obtain 98 kilograms of fruit.
    Today, on the 29,000 hectares of natural pastureland that can be grazed in spring, summer, and autumn throughout the region, there are 290,000 sheep and 210,000 goats, an average of two and a half per person.
    The people of Tropoja are particularly proud that industry has been established in their mountain region for the first time in its history. In 1956, a new mining town was born in the mountains, and truckloads of chromite ore were transported out of the mountains via newly opened highways. According to the mine's plan, chromite production in 1959 will increase by 400% compared to 1956. Today, Albania's chromite production ranks sixth in the world.
    Due to the prosperity of the economy, the backward state of the people's material and cultural life has completely changed. The people's purchasing power has greatly increased. In 1958, the total turnover of consumer goods in the region reached 106 million lek, while it was only 20 million lek in 1945. The mountain people have built new houses, with as many as 824 new houses built in recent years alone.
    Today, a rural cultural network covering the entire region has been formed. Every village has a primary school, and some rural areas have even established seven-year schools. Currently, there are forty-two primary schools and eight seven-year schools in the region, with a total of more than 2,400 students, which is more than three times the number before liberation. A middle school has also been established in the region, and another 200 young people are studying in middle schools and universities in other areas. Adults under the age of forty had already shed the label of illiteracy by the end of 1955. The era of ignorance and ignorance among the mountain people is long gone.
    On the eve of the 15th anniversary of Albania's liberation on November 29th, the mountain region is even more joyous, with singing and dancing everywhere. In order to welcome this year's national music, song, and dance festival, eighty-seven amateur song and dance groups with 450 people have performed many wonderful programs for the people of the region. The Tropoja mountain region has a beautiful cultural palace, fourteen cultural centers, and many people's reading rooms. In addition, cinemas, bookstores, etc. have been established. Such a rich and colorful cultural and entertainment life was something the mountain people could not even dream of before.
    Today, disease can no longer threaten the lives of the mountain people, and the health level of the people has greatly improved. There is now one hospital, one maternity hospital, and nine clinics in the region.
    This is today's Tropoja, this is the profound change that has taken place in this mountain region of less than 20,000 people in the past fifteen years!

    山区的新生
    江翔
    特罗波亚是阿尔巴尼亚北部的一个山区，在封建皇朝的统治时期，是全阿尔巴尼亚经济、文化最落后的一个地区。整个地区都被包围在丛山峻岭之中。落后的农业、原始的畜牧业是这个地区的唯一的经济，山区人民过着吃不饱，穿不暖的生活。几个世纪以来，由于交通的阻隔，这里像和人世隔绝了似的。人们为了一点点的日用品，不得不跑到二百公里以外的斯库台城去购买。解放前这里虽然有十一所小学五百多名学生，但几乎完全是地主富农们的“私塾”。全区85％以上的居民是文盲。即使如此，当时的统治阶级还一再叫嚷着阿尔巴尼亚的知识分子太多了。卫生情况更是落后，全区没有一名医生，没有一所医院，更谈不上妇产院、托儿所和幼儿园了，死亡经常威胁着山民们的生命。但是山区的偏僻并没有阻止封建皇朝的压榨，并没有阻止地主富农的剥削，山区人民每年辛勤劳动的收入四分之三落进了他们的腰包，另外，还要无代价地为他们服劳役。难怪人们常说：“特罗波亚的农村除了宪兵和收税官以外，从没有其他任何人的足迹”，贫困、饥饿、愚昧，这就是特罗波亚山区的概貌。
    十五年前的特罗波亚，也是解放前阿尔巴尼亚的一幅缩影。
    难道特罗波亚真的如此贫困吗？不，完全不是这样。这里有着肥沃的土地，良好的气候条件，非常适宜于农业和水果业的发展。这里有着美丽的草原和天然的牧场，它们为畜牧业的发展开辟了广阔的远景。这里蕴藏着丰富的矿产，特别是铬矿石。
    难道特罗波亚的人民甘心忍受残酷的剥削吗？不，他们早在1918年就在当地的民族英雄巴依拉·楚黑的领导下进行了反抗统治者的斗争。在1920—1924年的民主革命时期中，特罗波亚的山民为了反对索古王朝的统治一直英勇地打到地拉那城。随后，特罗波亚的人民又积极地参加了民族解放斗争，他们像山鹰似的和全国游击队员们转战在全国的土地上。
    解放后，特罗波亚的人民继承了光荣的革命传统，在山区里轰轰烈烈地进行社会主义建设，使山区的面貌焕然一新。今天在通往特罗波亚的公路上川流不息地行驶着装满各种日用品的大卡车，以满足山区人民日益增长的需要。
    特罗波亚的农牧业摆脱了原始的落后的状况。当家作主的农民积极地响应了党的号召，走上了农业合作化的道路。现在全区已有二十七个农业社，耕地面积占全区总面积的53％，农户占41.5％。大自然复苏了，拖拉机的机声响彻了田野和山谷，农业有了巨大的发展。全区的耕地面积从1938年的一千四百二十公顷增加到1958年的二千二百九十四公顷，灌溉面积从占耕地面积的40％增加到80％，粮食产量大大地超过了解放前。1958年全区玉米平均每公顷产量达到二十公担。现在，特罗波亚区已从一个缺粮区一跃而成为一个余粮区，这是特罗波亚人民在党的领导下所取得的一个伟大的胜利。
    果树业的发展给山区人民带来了更多的收入，今天由于公路的兴建，解决了水果的运输问题，使水果的生产获得了很大的发展，1938年全区仅有二万株果树，现在则猛增为四十万株，每年可生产二万吨水果，按人口计算，全区平均每人可得水果九十八公斤。
    今天，在全区的春、夏、秋三季都可放牧的二万九千公顷的天然牧场上放养着二十九万只绵羊和二十一万只山羊，平均每个人就有两只半。
    特罗波亚区人民特别引为骄傲的是，在他们山区的历史上第一次建立了工业。1956年一座新的矿工城在山区里诞生了，一车一车的铬矿石从新开辟的公路上运出了山区。根据矿场的计划，1959年的铬矿生产将比1956年增加400％，今天，阿尔巴尼亚铬矿的生产量已占世界第六位。
    由于经济的繁荣，人民物质和文化生活的落后的面貌完全改变了。人民的购买力已大大地提高了，1958年全区消费品营业额达到了一亿零六百万里克，而1945年仅为二千万里克，山区人民盖起了一座座的新房，单是最近几年来新盖的住宅就达八百二十四幢。
    今天一个全区的农村文化网已经形成起来了，村村有小学，有些农村还建立了七年制学校。目前全区有四十二所小学和八所七年制学校，共有学生二千四百多人，这就比解放前增加了三倍多。全区还建立了一所中学，另有二百名青年在外地的中学和高等学校里学习。四十岁以下的成年人还在1955年底就摘掉了文盲的帽子，山区人民愚昧无知的时代早已一去不复返了。
    在11月29日阿尔巴尼亚解放十五周年的前夕，山区里更是一片欢乐景象，到处载歌载舞。为了迎接今年的全国音乐、歌舞大会演，全区拥有四百五十人的八十七个业余歌舞小组为全区人民演出了许多精彩的节目。特罗波亚山区有一个漂亮的文化宫，十四个文化点和很多的人民阅览室。此外，还建立了电影院、书店……等等。这样丰富多彩的文化娱乐生活是以前山区人民做梦也想不到的。
    今天，病魔再也不能威胁山区人民的生命了，人民的健康水平有了大大地提高。现在全区有一所医院、一所产科医院、九所诊疗所。
    这就是今天的特罗波亚，这就是十五年来在这不到两万人的山区里所发生的深刻的变化！
