Comprehensive report from our newspaper: The Political Committee of the 14th United Nations General Assembly passed, on November 12th, a slightly modified proposal from Asian and African nations demanding that France cease nuclear testing in the Sahara. Forty-six national delegations voted in favor of the proposal, including most Asian and African nations, the Soviet Union and People's Democratic countries, and some European and Latin American nations. Twenty-six delegations voted against the proposal, including the United States, Britain, France, and their military bloc allies. Ten delegations abstained.

The Moroccan newspaper "Al-Tahrir" (Liberation) published an editorial on November 14th condemning the United States for voting against the Asian-African proposal in the UN General Assembly Political Committee, which demanded that France stop nuclear testing in the Sahara Desert. The editorial stated that this shows that the United States supports unjust acts. The editorial also said that the United States' attitude is inconsistent with its words.

The Cairo office of the Central Council of the Democratic Women's Union of Cameroon recently issued an "Appeal to Women Worldwide," condemning France's plan to test nuclear weapons in the Sahara region and calling on women worldwide to rise up and protest this inhumane act.

"Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station commented on the evening of November 13th that France had once again suffered a diplomatic defeat. Because the Algerian National Liberation Army is inflicting heavier blows on the French army than ever before, this defeat for France is a continuation of a series of military defeats it has suffered. The commentary went on to say that the UN resolution also shows the growing influence of the Asian and African countries that support the Algerian cause.

    本报综合报道　第十四届联合国大会政治委员会11月12日通过了经过稍许修改的亚非国家要求法国停止在撒哈拉进行核试验的提案。四十六个国家代表团投票赞成这个提案，其中包括大多数亚非国家、苏联和人民民主国家以及欧洲和拉丁美洲一些国家。二十六个代表团投票反对这个提案，其中包括美国、英国、法国及其军事集团的盟国。十个代表团弃权。
    摩洛哥“解放报”14日发表社论，谴责美国在联合国大会政治委员会里投票反对要求法国停止在撒哈拉沙漠进行核试验的计划的亚非提案。社论说，这表明，美国支持不正义的行为。社论还说，美国的态度同它的言词是不一致的。
    喀麦隆民主妇女联盟中央理事会驻开罗办事处最近在一项“致全世界妇女呼吁书”中，谴责法国计划在撒哈拉地区试验核武器，并且呼吁全世界妇女起来抗议这种不人道的行为。
    “阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台13日晚发表评论说，法国在外交方面又一次遭到了失败。由于阿尔及利亚民族解放军正在给予法国军队比过去任何时候更为沉重的打击，所以法国的这一次失败，是它在军事方面遭到一系列失败的继续。评论接着说，联合国的决议也表明，支持阿尔及利亚事业的亚非国家的影响日益增长。
