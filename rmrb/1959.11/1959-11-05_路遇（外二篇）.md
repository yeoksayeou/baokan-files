Encounter (and Two Other Pieces) Xia Meng
    Encounter
    I was walking fast, and the two people walking far ahead were slowly approaching, and finally, I caught up with them.
    They seemed like father and son. The old man was carrying a small basket; the young man was carrying a new iron shovel. They didn't know what interesting things they were talking about, and from time to time, they let out bursts of laughter. In front of them, a small donkey walked silently and cheerfully.
    When I heard their conversation clearly, I realized that they were talking about old things: the old man was talking about anecdotes of establishing the commune, and the young man was talking about interesting stories of making steel in government offices. I secretly guessed in my heart: the father is a production team leader, and the son is a government cadre. Judging from their cheerful expressions, this was a reunion after a long separation...
    We finally started chatting.
    "Old man, is this your… what number…?"
    "This is… the second one." The old man answered seriously.
    "Does he work in the city?"
    "Far away! He's from Beijing!" The old man's tone was obviously proud.
    I asked the young man curiously:
    "Where does your brother work?"
    The young man hesitated for a moment, but the old man told me seriously:
    "His brother is in Nanjing, tsk tsk, he's really a good cadre and a good worker!"
    I suddenly liked this old man. He praised his son without concealing his feelings!
    Their little donkey knew the way here, turning corners and going uphill without being urged. Suddenly, the donkey turned its head, ran a few steps, and turned onto the earthen slope. We had to part ways here.
    The old man squinted, smiled, and nodded to me, striding up the earthen slope. The young man suddenly leaned into my ear and said quietly:
    "You must believe what the old man said! To be honest, I'm a transferred cadre, and he's my landlord. He's as good as a real father! My 'brother' is also a transferred cadre. He has almost really become this old man's son. After returning to the government office, he keeps writing letters, addressing him as 'Dad' and 'Mom'..."
    We both laughed heartily. The old man couldn't hear what his "son" was saying, just stroked his beard and looked at us with a smile.

    Night Visit
    The roads in the polder area are not easy to walk. The narrow field ridges are the only thoroughfares, and the crisscrossing small rivers are like spider webs. Unfamiliar people will accidentally fall into a "trap" and be surrounded by water. Now, I, a person unfamiliar with the roads, have to go to the commune Party secretary at night. He went out to inspect work, like flying all over the sky, not knowing which village he landed in…
    It was almost midnight when I had already run through several production brigades. When I arrived at the Fifth Brigade, famous for its diversified economy, they said he had gone to the Sixth Brigade, which was in the most urgent need of drought resistance. When I arrived at the Sixth Brigade, they said the secretary had just left.
    Now is the time when rice is heading, and a warm breeze blows, and you can smell the fragrance of rice flowers. The weather is dry, and everywhere they are drawing water to save the seedlings, and everywhere there is the urgent and low sound of gongs and drums "dong qiang, dong qiang." Here, people beat gongs and drums while drawing water. The rhythmic sound of gongs and drums directs the speed of drawing water and also invigorates people's spirits. Therefore, even in the middle of the night, I don't feel lonely. The sound of gongs and drums from one place slowly fades away, and the sound of gongs and drums from another place slowly approaches…
    As I approached a village, I passed a place where they were drawing water.
    "Comrade, how do I get to the village ahead?"
    Four strong young men stopped the gongs and drums. I told them that I was going to the village ahead to find the busy secretary.
    "Looking for the secretary? Go to the village behind!"
    "The village behind?" I clearly remembered someone telling me he was in the village ahead.
    "He was in the village ahead just now, but he was pulled to the village behind to deliver a baby!"
    I was momentarily speechless by this unexpected news.
    "Comrade, didn't you know he was a doctor in the army?"
    After going around a few bends and crossing a few rivers, I finally arrived at the village behind and finally found the family who was having a baby. When I raised my hand to knock on the door, my heart started beating: I was finally going to see him here.
    An old lady opened the door. It was quiet inside, and it didn't seem like anything was happening. My heart sank.
    The old lady told me that her daughter-in-law had a difficult labor. There was no time to ask a doctor at night, so they asked the secretary to come. The secretary took a look and said that they had to send her to the county hospital…
    "Where did the secretary go?"
    "Eh…" The old lady seemed surprised by my question: "He was one of those who carried the pregnant woman to the city…"
    Stepping on the way home, my heart was filled with feelings of happiness and pride. Isn't it precisely because there are thousands upon thousands of people who are sleepless and tireless for the people that our people can live better and better?

    Small Talk
    When my legs were sore from walking, I was overjoyed to find a small shop where I could rest my legs ahead. The small shop built a shed by the roadside, with two or three plank tables and four or five benches. If you were thirsty, you could buy tea to drink; if you wanted to smoke, there were several brands of cigarettes…
    Several young commune members passing by were talking loudly. As soon as I sat down, I was attracted by their conversation.
    "...She said: 'Produce a thousand catties? As long as I can produce five hundred, I don't want a year's worth of work points!'... Do you know what the county Party secretary said: 'Okay, wait and see, it seems like you're going to lose a year's worth of work points.' Later, the rice seedlings grew really well, and as soon as they headed, you could see the 'signs.' One day, the secretary came to see the experimental field, and he asked her: 'How is it, are you sure to lose!' This old woman had to blush and say: 'I believe I can produce a thousand catties!' She didn't mention the work points at all..."
    Several young people laughed heartily.
    "Hey, it's not always easy to open up a conservative mind. I know an old man who insisted that it wouldn't work when he heard about close planting. He said he would use his old method to compete with close planting to see which plot would increase production..."
    "Compete? What would he use to compete..."
    "Compete! The commune decided to have a competition. On one side were young lads, planting closely; on the other side was the old man, also working hard. But, after planting the seedlings and taking a look... the old man didn't plant his seedlings any more sparsely than the young lads..."
    "What's going on?"
    "The old man was stubborn but afraid, and when he was afraid, he planted densely..."
    There was another burst of laughter.
    Walking in the countryside, you can hear this kind of small talk at any time, talking about things during the Great Leap Forward. The commune members laugh at conservative ideas, not only laughing at others but also laughing at themselves. This laughter plays a big role in further liberating thinking and continuing to leap forward. One commune member said: "Don't be conservative anymore, lest you become a laughingstock in the future!"

    路遇（外二篇）夏孟
    路遇
    我走得很快，前面远远走着的两个人慢慢地接近，最后，终于赶上了他们。
    他们像是爷儿俩。老头手提小篮；年轻人扛一把新铁锹。他们不知谈着什么有趣的事情，不时发出哈哈的笑声。在他们前面，一匹小驴默默地欢快地走着。
    当我听清他们的谈话时，才知道谈的都是旧事：老头谈的是成立公社的插曲，小伙子谈的是机关炼钢的趣闻。我心里暗暗地猜测：父亲是一个生产队长，儿子是一个机关干部。看他们眉花眼笑的神情，这次是久别重逢……
    我们终于攀谈起来。
    “老大爷，这是你的第几个……？”
    “这是……第二个。”老头认真地回答。
    “是在城里工作？”
    “远哩！从北京来的！”老头的口气带着明显的自豪。
    我好奇地问起这个小伙子：
    “你的哥哥呢，他在哪里工作？”
    小伙子迟疑了一下，老头却认真地告诉我：
    “他哥哥在南京，啧啧，真是个好干部，又是个好劳动！”
    我忽然喜欢起这个老头来，他对儿子的赞美，毫不掩饰自己的感情！
    他们的小毛驴认得这里的路径，拐弯上坡，不必吆喝。忽然，驴子调过头，奔跑几步，拐上了土坡。我们要在这里分手了。
    老头眯起眼睛，笑着朝我点点头，大踏步跨上了土坡。小伙子忽然凑到我耳边，悄悄地说：
    “你一定相信大爷的话吧！说实在，我是下放干部，他是我的房东。他真像亲爹一样好！我那位‘哥哥’，也是下放干部。他几乎真的成了这个大爷的儿子，回机关后不断来信，口口声声称爹称娘……”
    我们两个都哈哈笑了起来。老头听不清他的“儿子”说些什么，只是摸摸胡子，笑眯眯地望着我们。
    夜访
    圩区的路不好走，狭窄的田塍就是来往的通路，纵横的小河像蛛网一样，陌生的人一不小心，就会落入“葫芦套”，被水团团围困。现在，我这个路径不熟的人，却要连夜去找公社党委书记。他出去检查工作，像满天飞一样，不知落在哪一个村……
    将近半夜时分，我已经跑过了好几个生产大队。到了以多种经营著名的第五大队，说他到抗旱最紧急的第六大队去了。到了第六大队，又说书记刚走。
    现在正是水稻抽穗的时节，一股暖风吹来，可以闻到稻花的幽香。天气干旱，到处都在车水救苗，到处传来“咚锵，咚锵”的紧迫低沉的锣鼓声。这里的习惯，人们一边车水，一边要敲锣打鼓。具有节奏的锣鼓声指挥着车水的快慢，也振奋着人们的精神。因此，虽然是在深夜，我也并不感到寂寞，一处的锣鼓声慢慢远去，又是一处的锣鼓声慢慢近来……
    在接近一个村庄的时候，我路过一个车水的地方。
    “同志，到前村怎么走啊？”
    四个精壮的小伙子歇下了锣鼓。我告诉他们，我要到前村去找忙碌的书记。
    “找书记？到后村去吧！”
    “后村？”我明明记得有人告诉我他在前村。
    “刚才是在前村，给人拉到后村接生去了！”
    我一时被这意外的消息弄得答不上话。
    “同志，你不知道他在部队当过医生的吗？”
    兜了几个弯，绕过几条河，我终于到了后村，终于找到了生孩子的人家。举起手来敲门时，我的心跳动起来：我终于要在这里见到他了。
    开门出来的是一位老大娘。屋里静悄悄的，不像有事的样子。我的心凉了一半。
    老大娘告诉我：她的儿媳妇难产，夜里来不及请医生，把书记请来了。书记看了看，说只好送县里的医院。……
    “书记呢，他到哪里去了？”
    “咦……”老大娘似乎对我的问话感到惊奇：“抬产妇进城的就有他一个……”……
    踏上归途，我的心里涌起幸福和自豪的感情。我们的人民能够生活得越来越好，不是正因为有千千万万这样为了人民不眠不休的人吗？
    笑谈
    我的两条腿走得发酸的时候，发现前面有一个可以歇腿的小店，真是喜出望外。小店在路边搭一个席棚，摆两三张板桌，放四五条板凳。口渴，可以买茶喝；要抽烟，有好几种牌子的香烟……
    几个过路的年轻社员正在高谈阔论。我刚一坐下，就被他们的谈笑吸引了。
    “……她说：‘出一千斤？只要能出五百，我就不要一年的工分！’……你们知道县委书记怎么说：‘好，等着瞧，看来你这一年的工分算是输定了’。后来，稻苗长得真好，一吐穗，就看出‘苗头’来了。有一天，书记来看试验田，他就问她：‘怎么样，输定了吧！’这个大娘只好红着脸说：‘我相信能出一千斤！’工分的事，她半句不提……”
    几个年轻人都哈哈笑了起来。
    “嘿，保守脑瓜总不是一下子就能开窍。我知道有个老头，他一听要密植，硬说不行。他说要用自己的老办法跟密植的赛赛，看哪块地增产……”
    “还赛呢，他用什么赛……”
    “赛！社里决定赛。这边是年轻小伙子，栽的是密植；那边是老头，也搞得挺起劲。可是，栽完了秧一看哪……这老头栽的也不比小伙子稀……”
    “这是怎么回事？”
    “老头嘴硬心虚，心一虚，手底下就栽密了……”
    又是一阵笑声。
    在乡间行走，随时可以听到这种笑谈，说的都是大跃进中的事情。社员们笑保守思想，不但笑人家的，也笑自己的。这一笑，在进一步解放思想、继续跃进的时候它就起着很大的作用。有一个社员说：“可不要再保守，免得往后成了笑柄！”
