Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from New York: The United Nations headquarters issued a press release on the 8th, announcing that United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld would depart for Laos on the 10th for a "visit."

The press release stated that Hammarskjöld's trip to Laos was to obtain a so-called "independent and full direct understanding" of the situation in the country.

The United Nations Security Council's subcommittee sent to Laos under the orchestration of the United States recently released its investigation report. This report failed to provide any evidence sufficient to prove the slander by the United States and the Sananikone group against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding so-called "aggression" against Laos. According to news from the United Nations, the purpose of Hammarskjöld's trip to Laos is to further plan intervention in Laos.

    哈马舍尔德前往老挝
    进一步策划干涉行动
    新华社9日讯　纽约消息：联合国总部8日发表公报，宣布联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德将在10日动身前往老挝“访问”。
    公报说，哈马舍尔德去老挝是要对这个国家的局势获得所谓“独立和充分的直接了解”。
    在美国策划下派往老挝的联合国安全理事会调查小组委员会最近发表了它的调查报告，这个报告未能提供任何证据足以证明美国和萨纳尼空集团诬蔑越南民主共和国所谓“侵略”老挝的谰言。据来自联合国的消息表明，哈马舍尔德老挝之行的目的是要进一步策划干涉老挝的行动。
