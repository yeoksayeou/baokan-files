To do work, we must pay attention to grasping the key; only by grasping the key can we do the work well.

If we want to carry out water conservancy construction in a faster, better, and more economical way, what key should we grasp? The conditions and situations vary from place to place, and the problems that need to be solved will naturally not be exactly the same. However, the problem of insufficient labor seems to still be a fundamental one, and tool reform is the fundamental key to solving the shortage of labor.

The problem of insufficient labor emerged at the same time as the Great Leap Forward began last year. This problem still exists in this winter's production, which is the best proof of the vigorous development of our cause. According to a survey in Jingzhou Prefecture, Hubei Province, in order to successfully complete the huge agricultural production and construction tasks centered on water conservancy this winter and next spring, a total of 350 million standard workdays are needed. However, the existing labor force in the entire region can only provide 150 million standard workdays, a shortage of nearly 60%. What should we do? Reduce the scale of production and construction? Of course not. This does not meet the urgent needs of the broad masses. Increase labor intensity? This is limited and not a normal solution. The only correct way is to improve work efficiency, so that one person can do the work of two or three people, increasing labor efficiency many times over. This can only be achieved by reforming tools and gradually realizing semi-mechanization and mechanization.

So, what is the key to doing a good job in tool reform? The fact that Jingzhou Prefecture, Hubei Province, achieved great results in tool reform during the water conservancy upsurge answers this question. That is to do a good job in ideological mobilization and closely integrate tool reform with the progress of the project.

At the beginning of the project, the tool reform work there was not very good. Some people also emphasized "no money, no raw materials, no workers," and could not carry out tool reform. What was the reality? It turned out that these were all false appearances, and they did not truly recognize the importance of tool reform ideologically. Once they recognized the benefits of tool reform, the "three no's" became "three yes's," and all so-called difficulties were easily solved. Therefore, they gained an experience: to reform tools well, first reform thinking well. This experience seems to have universal significance. As long as we truly oppose right-leaning conservative thinking, we can muster greater enthusiasm. Methods are devised by people, and things are done by people. Once the broad masses take action, tool reform will immediately produce results.

After the ideological problem is solved, the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses is mobilized, and the leadership must be good at organizing work, guiding the enthusiasm, energy, and wisdom of the people to the most urgent needs. The Party Committee of the Zhanghe Reservoir construction site did a very good job. They closely based their work on the needs of the project progress, and carried out the tool reform movement according to local conditions and engineering conditions. Therefore, they achieved the goal of reforming wherever the project progressed; reforming whatever tools were needed for what terrain; and achieving the goal of everyone reforming, reforming every day, experimenting and promoting simultaneously, and constantly experimenting and constantly promoting. Therefore, the tool reform here has achieved great results, and work efficiency has increased by more than four times.

The upsurge of water conservancy construction in the vast rural areas of the country has already developed vigorously. If all regions carry out tool reform movements and increase work efficiency many times over, they will surely complete the water conservancy construction tasks in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    关键
    作工作要讲究抓关键，抓住关键才能把工作做好。
    要想把水利建设搞得多快好省，需要抓住哪一个关键呢？各个地方的条件、情况不同，需要解决的问题自然也不会完全一样，但劳力不足问题看来仍然是一个带有根本性的问题，而工具改革则是解决劳动力不足的根本关键。
    劳动力不足的问题从去年大跃进一开始，也就同时出现了，今年冬季生产中这个问题依然存在，这是我们的事业蓬勃发展的最好证明。据湖北省荆州专区调查，要胜利完成今冬明春以水利为中心的巨大的农业生产建设任务，共需要三亿五千万个标准工，而全区现有劳力只能出一亿五千万个标准工，尚缺少将近60％的标准工。怎么办呢？缩小生产建设规模吗？当然不行，这不符合广大群众的迫切需要。加强劳动强度吗？这是有限度的，而且也不是正常的办法。唯一正确的办法是提高工效，让一个人能做两个人、三个人的活，成倍以至几倍地提高劳动效率。这就只能靠改革工具，逐步实现半机械化、机械化。
    那么，搞好工具改革的关键又是什么呢？湖北省荆州专区在水利高潮中改革工具获得巨大成绩的事实，解答了这个问题。这就是做好思想发动工作，把工具改革紧紧地同工程进度结合起来。
    工程开始的时候，他们那里的工具改革工作搞的并不太好，有些人也强调“无钱，无原料，无工人”，搞不起工具改革。事实怎么样呢？原来这些都是假象，都是思想上没有真正认识改革工具的重要性，一旦认识了改革工具的好处，“三无”变成了“三有”，一切所谓困难都迎刃而解了。所以，他们得到了一条经验：要改好工具，先改好思想。这个经验，看来有普遍意义，只要真正反掉右倾保守思想，就能鼓起更大干劲。办法是人想出来的，事情是人作出来的，广大群众一旦行动起来，工具改革就会立见功效。
    思想问题解决以后，广大群众的冲天干劲发动起来了，领导上要善于作组织工作，把人民群众的热情、干劲、智慧引导到最迫切需要的地方去。漳河水库工地党委作得很好，他们紧紧根据工程进展的需要，因地制宜因工程制宜地开展了工具改革运动，因而作到了工程进展到哪里，就改革到哪里；什么地势需要什么工具，就改革什么工具；作到了人人改、天天改，边试验、边推广和不断试验、不断推广。因此，这里的工具改革成绩大，工效提高了四倍以上。
    全国广大农村的水利建设高潮已经蓬蓬勃勃发展起来，如果各地区都开展工具改革运动，也把工效成倍以至几倍地提高，一定会更多更快更好更省地完成水利建设任务。
