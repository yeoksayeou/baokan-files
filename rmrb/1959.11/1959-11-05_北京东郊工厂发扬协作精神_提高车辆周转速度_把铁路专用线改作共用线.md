Beijing East Suburb Factories Promote Cooperative Spirit and Increase Vehicle Turnover Rate by Converting Railway Spurs into Shared Lines

    (Our report) Factories and enterprises in the Beijing East Suburb Station area are promoting a communist spirit of cooperation, changing the railway spurs used separately by each unit into shared lines used jointly between enterprises. This has shortened the time vehicles spend at the station for operations by nearly half, and the speed of vehicle turnover has doubled, greatly increasing the station's transportation capacity and playing a positive role in increasing production and practicing economy for nearby factories and enterprises.

    The East Suburb Station area is the capital's industrial zone, with more than two hundred factories and enterprises handling freight business at this station. With the development of production and construction, the station's equipment capacity has become increasingly unable to meet the needs of increased transport volume. In the first quarter of this year, the station received an average of 325 freight cars per day, but the station only had 164 freight spaces (a section of land for loading and unloading goods from one car is considered one freight space). As a result, there were frequent occurrences of backlog congestion and stacking and overlapping unloading. This not only prolonged the time vehicles spent at the station but also often caused accidents such as damage and spoilage of goods, affecting industrial production.

    In order to resolve the contradiction between freight volume and insufficient station equipment, the transportation command in this area, under the leadership of the Chaoyang District Committee of the Communist Party of China, sent a working group in late March of this year to understand the equipment capacity of the East Suburb Station and the transportation situation of various factories and enterprises. After investigation, it was found that most of the thirty-one spurs distributed in the station area had very low utilization efficiency. Of the more than 2,900 freight spaces set up on both sides of these spurs, one-ninth had been "space without goods," and the potential of other freight spaces was also very large. The vacant freight spaces were more than twice the size of the station's freight spaces. In the fourth quarter of last year, some cargo owners, because the goods in the station were piled up and could not be loaded or unloaded, used these vacant freight spaces to load and unload goods. Several cargo owners also established a "third-party use" relationship with the owners of the spurs, using the vacant land on both sides of the spurs as unloading sites. These temporary measures had played a certain role in meeting the urgent needs of some cargo owners. However, due to the lack of unified leadership and comprehensive planning, these measures were not better promoted.

    Based on this situation, the Chaoyang District Transportation Command convened a meeting of cargo owners and spur owners, jointly determining the principle of "unified planning, comprehensive arrangement, and rational use" and the principle of "social cooperation, benefit for everyone, priority for owners, and care for the neighboring," and gradually changing ten spurs suitable for common use into shared lines.

    The facts of the past few months have proved that unified use of spurs has four major benefits: First, it has increased the station's throughput capacity and shortened the time vehicles spend at the station for operations. Compared with the first quarter, the average time vehicles spent at the station in the third quarter was shortened from 15.1 hours to 8.2 hours, and vehicle turnover was accelerated by nearly one time. At present, more than 60% of the station's freight volume is loaded and unloaded through shared lines, basically eliminating the phenomenon of goods backlog and damage.

    Second, it ensures the time of arrival and departure of goods for cargo owners and spur owners, and the increase in lines allows for loading and unloading nearby, shortening the transportation distance and saving a lot of freight.

    Third, unified use of spurs plays an important role in saving transportation capacity, rationally using transportation capacity, and improving transportation efficiency. In the past, each cargo owner went directly to the station to transport goods, with an average transportation distance of 9.24 kilometers. Now, each cargo owner uses the shared lines to load and unload goods nearby, and the average transportation distance is shortened to 2.46 kilometers. According to the transportation volume in this area this year, a total of more than 10,000 vehicle-days can be saved, saving more than 197,000 liters of gasoline. After the transportation distance is shortened, horse-drawn carts and tricycles can also be used to replace automobile transportation, providing favorable conditions for the rational use of transportation capacity.

    Fourth, the lines and freight spaces added in this way can save 800,000 yuan in investment and a large amount of steel compared with new construction, and it saves construction time and can be used immediately. (Zhou Dingfang)

    北京东郊工厂发扬协作精神  提高车辆周转速度
    把铁路专用线改作共用线
    本报讯　北京东郊车站地区许多工厂、企业发扬共产主义协作精神，将各单位分别使用的铁路专用线改为企业之间共同使用的共用线，使车辆在车站的停站作业时间缩短将近一半，车辆周转的速度加快一倍，大大增加了这个车站的运输能力，对附近工厂企业的增产节约起了良好的作用。
    东郊车站附近是首都的工业区，二百多个工厂、企业在这个车站办理货运业务。随着生产建设的发展，这个车站的设备能力日益不能满足运输量增长的需要。今年第一季度，这个车站每天平均运到的货物达三百二十五个车厢，但是全站的货位只有一百六十四个（一个车厢的装卸货物地段为一个货位）。因此，经常发生积压堵塞、重堆迭卸等现象。这样，不仅延长了车辆的停站时间，而且常常造成货物损坏变质等事故，影响工业生产。
    为了解决货运量和车站设备不足的矛盾，这个地区的运输指挥部今年3月下旬，在中共朝阳区委的领导下，派出工作组了解了东郊车站的设备能力和各个工厂、企业的运输情况。经过调查，发现分布在站区的三十一条专用线，大部分使用效率都很低。设置在这些专用线两旁的二千九百多个货位，有九分之一一直是“有位无货”，其他货位的潜力也很大。空着的货位比车站的货位还大一倍。去年第四季度，有一些货主因为车站内的货物堆积，无法装卸，曾经利用这些空闲的货位装卸过货物。有几家货主还与专用线主建立了“第三者使用”关系，利用专用线两旁的空地作为卸货场地。这些临时措施，对满足部分货主的急需曾经起过一定作用。但是由于缺乏统一领导和全面规划，这些措施没有更好地推行。
    根据这个情况，朝阳区运输指挥部召开了货主和专用线业主会议，共同确定了“统一规划，全面安排，合理使用”的方针和“社会协作，家家有利，业主优先，照顾临近”的原则，把适合共同使用的十条专用线，陆续改变成共用线。
    几个月的事实证明，统一使用专用线有四大好处：第一，增加了车站的吞吐能力，缩短了车辆停站作业时间。今年第三季度同第一季度比较，车辆平均停站时间由十五点一小时缩短到八点二小时，车辆周转加快将近一倍。目前，全站的货运量平均有60％以上都是通过共用线装卸的，基本上消除了货物积压和损坏现象。
    第二，保证了货主和专用线业主的货物到达和发出的时间，而且线路增加，可以就近装卸，缩短运距，节省了大量运费。
    第三，统一使用专用线，对节约运力、合理使用运力和提高运输效率有重要作用。以往，各个货主都直接到车站去运送货物，平均运距为九点二四公里。现在，各个货主利用共用线就近装卸货物，平均运距缩短到二点四六公里。按照这个地区今年的运量计算，总共可以少用汽车一万多个车日，节省汽油十九万七千多公升。运距缩短以后，还能用马车、三轮车来代替汽车运输，为合理使用运力提供了有利条件。
    第四，这样增加的线路和货位，比新建可以节省八十万元投资和大量钢材，而且省掉了建设的时间，可以立即使用。　（周定舫）
