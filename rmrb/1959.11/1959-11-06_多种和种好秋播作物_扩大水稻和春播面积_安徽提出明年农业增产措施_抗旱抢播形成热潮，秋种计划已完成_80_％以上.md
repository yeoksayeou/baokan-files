Plant More and Plant Good Autumn Crops; Expand Rice and Spring Planting Areas
Anhui Proposes Measures to Increase Agricultural Production Next Year
An Anti-Drought Rush to Plant Forms a Tide, Autumn Planting Plan More Than 80% Complete
(Our newspaper Hefei dispatch, 5th) The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, starting from the requirements of small effort, little money, large increase in production, and rapid increase in production, based on the experience of the "Three Reforms" (i.e., the reform of the cultivation system, crop varieties, and cultivation methods) and the implementation of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture in the past, proposed major measures to strive for a continued leap forward in agricultural production next year. The people of the province are launching a vigorous struggle to implement these measures.

One of the important measures proposed by the Provincial Party Committee is to expand the area of autumn planting, sow on time with assured quality and quantity, and increase the summer harvest next year. In the past, Anhui proposed this method of avoiding disasters to ensure harvests and increasing production by avoiding disasters, based on the fact that the province is prone to drought and floods in autumn, while the climate and rainfall before summer are relatively stable. After this method was proposed in the "Three Reforms" in previous years, various localities expanded the area of autumn planting and increased the yield per unit area. From 1954 to this year, the total output of summer grain has been increased by more than double. However, the potential for expanding the area of autumn planting in the province is still very large. In the Huaibei area, the area of autumn planting has been expanded to more than 85% of the cultivated land area, while in many parts of the Huainan area, it only accounts for about 40%. Therefore, continuing to expand the area of autumn planting can greatly increase the summer harvest yield in Anhui.

The call to plant more and plant good autumn crops has become the practical action of the people of the province in autumn planting. Various localities have arranged stubble according to local conditions and expanded the area of autumn planting. The area of autumn-sown grain in the Lu'an Special District has expanded by more than 2 million mu compared with last year, and the Wuhu and Anqing Special Districts have also expanded a lot. Feixi County had an autumn planting area of more than 500,000 mu last year. This year, with reasonable arrangement of stubble, it can be expanded to 1.01 million mu. While expanding the area of autumn planting, all localities attach special importance to completing the tasks on time with assured quality and quantity. The more than 800,000 mu of wheat that has been sown in Suxian County has all been made into ridge fields.

Expanding the area of rice planting is another important measure proposed by the Provincial Party Committee. Rice production increases much more than dry land crops. For example, the 5 million mu of rice converted to rice in Huaibei this year, thanks to the river network water conservancy projects, still had a yield per unit area one to two times higher than that of dry land crops under severe drought, and many large-area high-yield fields with yields of over 1,000 jin appeared. Based on this situation, the Provincial Party Committee requires that plans be made from the province to each production team to expand the area of rice planting next year, and water conservancy projects be built according to the plan to ensure water for rice next year. Now all parts of the province are arranging stubble and formulating water conservancy plans for expanding the area of rice next year.

The third measure is to expand the spring planting area next year. In the past, some cotton and tobacco in Anhui were planted in wheat stubble fields. Generally, the yield of wheat stubble cotton is 30% to 50% lower than that of spring-sown cotton; the yield of spring tobacco is generally 20% higher than that of summer tobacco, and if two crops of tobacco are added, the yield will be doubled compared to summer tobacco. The Provincial Party Committee has formulated a plan to expand the spring planting area next year, in which cotton and tobacco will all be changed to spring planting. Now all localities are actively selecting and retaining good spring-sown varieties during the autumn harvest.

In order to ensure the expansion of the spring planting area, the Provincial Party Committee proposed to reclaim 7.5 million mu of wasteland this winter and next spring. A large-scale wasteland reclamation movement has been launched throughout the province. Many people's communes have established wasteland reclamation professional teams to uniformly survey and plan land, uniformly use labor and tractors. Since the autumn, more than 3 million mu of wasteland have been reclaimed in the province, some of which have been planted with rapeseed, vegetables and other crops. The Bengbu Special District has reclaimed more than 830,000 mu of wasteland north and south of the Huaihe River, and half of it has been planted with vegetables.

Changing all crops to good varieties is an important measure with a large increase in production and small effort. For example, if the original sorghum variety in Huaibei is changed to multi-headed sorghum, the production can be increased by more than double; if the Victory indica rice variety is changed to japonica rice, the production can be greatly increased. This measure has been seriously implemented in this year's autumn planting.

In order to implement the above-mentioned production increase measures, the Provincial Party Committee requires a major water conservancy construction battle to be launched this winter and next spring, so that areas prone to drought and floods can quickly get rid of disasters. Throughout the province, combined with the anti-drought wheat planting, 500,000 people have begun to engage in the battle of water conservancy construction. In order to obtain a large amount of fertilizer, the Provincial Party Committee proposed measures such as raising more livestock and domestic animals and poultry, using vacant land to grow more green manure, reeds and other crops, producing a large amount of native fertilizer, and using biogas as fuel to save firewood for fertilizer. It is estimated that each person needs to use 1,000 jin of firewood to cook every year. If these firewood are composted and fermented, there will be biogas and high-quality fertilizer, which can be described as killing two birds with one stone. All parts of the province are vigorously promoting the work of using biogas. The Provincial Party Committee has also proposed many important measures for establishing breeding bases, vigorously reforming tools, rationally arranging labor, and vigorously developing forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production and fishery.

These major measures have given the peasants of the province a clear goal of struggle, so once they were proposed, they formed a vigorous mass movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 5th The Anhui Province has overcome the drought, and the autumn planting work has been completed quickly and well. By the end of October, the province had planted more than 4.1 million mu of wheat, barley, broad beans, and peas, accounting for more than 80% of the planned planting area; and planted 5.23 million mu of rapeseed, successfully completing the plan.

Anhui Province had a very severe summer drought this year, followed by an autumn drought. Most areas on both sides of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River have not had rain for more than 100 days. Funan County, the most severely drought-stricken, had a total rainfall of 106 mm from June 20 to October 26, a decrease of 467 mm compared to previous years. Although there were several rains in Anhui Province in August and September, the drought was not completely relieved, and the drought situation developed again in late September. According to incomplete statistics from the Bengbu, Wuhu, and Anqing Special Districts in late October, the drought-affected area reached more than 5 million mu. Since October 29, there has been widespread rainfall in various parts of the province, with rainfall of 20 to 30 mm, and the drought has been alleviated. The people's communes in various localities actively fought the drought and planted. The vast majority of the 1.6 to 1.7 million mu of overwintering grain crops in the Wuhu and Anqing Special Districts were planted under drought-resistant conditions. The Bengbu Special District, which spans both sides of the Huaihe River, mobilized more than 630,000 people in the anti-drought planting, and adopted methods such as irrigating the fields, planting with water, and taking advantage of the moisture to plant, planting 800,000 to 900,000 mu every day. In many places, the cowardice of a few cadres was criticized, greatly accelerating the progress of wheat planting. In Huoqiu County, 300,000 commune members launched a red flag competition to compare their enthusiasm, methods, quality, and progress, which greatly promoted the anti-drought planting, and quickly planted more than 600,000 mu of summer-ripening crops, and achieved the requirements of sufficient base fertilizer, wide-row strip planting, deep ditch and high ridges, and smooth soil.

In the autumn planting, the people's communes in various localities all implemented large-scale cooperation. According to the autumn planting tasks, the labor and animal power were rationally arranged, and the relatively weak production teams were vigorously helped to ensure that these teams could complete the autumn planting plan on time, with assured quality and quantity. Most areas of the Wuhu Special District have been dry for a long time this year, and the labor and tools used for autumn planting have doubled compared to the past, but due to the full play of the superiority of the people's communes, the unified deployment and arrangement of labor, animal power, and tools were implemented, and large-scale corps operations and mutual cooperation were launched, so that the 1.5 million mu of rapeseed in the entire special district was basically planted by October 20, half a month earlier than last year.

In order to improve the quality of autumn planting, the reform of autumn planting agricultural tools has been carried out in various localities, and more than 200,000 pieces of deep plows, improved harrows, close-planting drills, and tractors have been newly manufactured and reformed throughout the province. The winter fields that have been sown have generally achieved deep plowing and application of base fertilizer, and have achieved reasonable close planting and ridge fields. The phenomena of shallow plowing, narrow ridges, broadcasting, and planting in white fields have also been basically eliminated in a few remote and thin fields.

Recently, the communes in various parts of Anhui have launched a climax of rushing to plant while the soil is still moist.

    多种和种好秋播作物　扩大水稻和春播面积
    安徽提出明年农业增产措施
    抗旱抢播形成热潮，秋种计划已完成80％以上
    本报合肥5日电　中共安徽省委，从花力小，花钱少，增产大，增产快的要求出发，根据过去全省推行“三改”（即耕作制度、作物品种、耕作方法的改革）和贯彻农业八字宪法经验，提出了争取明年农业生产继续跃进的重大措施。全省人民为实现这些措施，展开了轰轰烈烈的斗争。
    省委提出的重要措施之一是，扩大秋种面积，按质按量按时下种，增加明年夏季收成。这是安徽过去根据本省秋季多旱涝灾害，而夏季以前气候雨量比较平稳的情况，提出的一项避灾保收、避灾增产的办法。前几年在“三改”中提出这一办法后，各地都扩大了秋种面积，并提高了单位面积产量，从1954年到今年，已使夏收粮食总产量提高了一倍以上。但是，全省扩大秋种面积的潜力还很大。淮北地区秋种面积已扩大到占耕地面积85％以上，而淮南地区许多地方只占到40％左右。所以继续扩大秋种面积，就能使安徽的夏收产量大大提高。
    多种和种好秋种作物的这一号召，已变成全省人民在秋种中的实际行动。各地都根据当地情况安排了茬口，扩大了秋种面积。六安专区秋种粮食面积比去年扩大二百多万亩，芜湖、安庆专区也扩大很多。肥西县去年秋种面积为五十多万亩，今年合理安排茬口，可扩大到一百零一万亩。各地在扩大秋种面积同时，特别重视按质、按量、按时完成任务。宿县已种的八十多万亩小麦，都作到了畦田化。
    扩大水稻面积，是省委提出的另一重大措施。水稻增产比旱粮大得多，如在淮北今年改种的五百万亩水稻，由于有了河网化水利工程，在严重干旱下，单位面积产量仍比旱粮高一倍到两倍以上，并出现了许多千斤以上的大面积丰产田。省委根据这个情况，要求从省到每个生产小队，都在今年订好扩大水稻面积计划，并根据计划兴修水利，保证明年水稻用水。现在全省各地正为扩大明年的水稻安排茬口和制订水利计划。
    措施之三，是扩大明年的春播面积。过去安徽有一部分棉花和烟叶是在麦茬地种的，一般麦茬棉产量要比春播棉低30％到50％；春烟的产量比夏烟一般高20％，如再加二茬烟，比夏烟产量提高一倍。省委制订了明年扩大春播面积的计划，其中棉花、烟叶将全部改为春播。现在各地正在秋收中积极选留春播良种。
    为保证扩大春播面积，省委提出今冬明春开荒七百五十万亩。全省规模巨大的开垦荒地运动已经展开，许多人民公社成立了开荒专业队，统一勘查和规划土地，统一使用劳力和拖拉机，入秋以来，全省已开荒三百多万亩，其中有一部分已经种上油菜、蔬菜等作物。蚌埠专区已在淮河南北开荒八十三万多亩，半数已经种上了蔬菜。
    所有作物全部改用良种，是一项增产大、花力小的重要措施。如把原来淮北的高粱种换成多头高粱，即可增产一倍多；把胜利籼稻种换成粳稻就能大幅度增产。今年秋种已经认真贯彻了这一措施。
    为了实现以上增产措施，省委要求在今冬明春开展兴修水利大战，要使易旱易涝地区，迅速摆脱灾害。全省结合抗旱种麦，已有五十万人开始投入了兴修水利的战斗。为了获得大量的肥料，省委提出了用多养牲口和家畜家禽、利用空地多种绿肥、芦苇等作物，大量制造土化肥，大量利用沼气作燃料，节省柴草作肥料等措施。据估计，每年每个人要用一千斤柴草煮饭，如果把这些柴草沤制发酵，既有了沼气，又有了优质肥料，可谓一举两得。全省各地正在大力推广利用沼气的工作。省委对建立饲养基地、大力改革工具、合理安排劳动力，大力发展林牧副渔的生产也提出许多重要措施。
    这些重大措施，使全省农民有了明确的奋斗目标，所以一经提出便形成了轰轰烈烈的群众运动。
    新华社合肥5日电　安徽省战胜了干旱，秋种工作完成的又快又好。到10月底，全省已种小麦、大麦、蚕豆和豌豆等四千一百多万亩，占计划播种面积的80％以上；播种油菜五百二十三万亩，已胜利地完成计划。
    安徽省今年的夏旱很严重，夏旱之后又发生了秋旱。长江和淮河两岸大部分地区一百多天未下雨，干旱最严重的阜南县从6月20日到10月26日，共下雨一百零六毫米，比往年减少四百六十七毫米。安徽省各地8、9月份虽然下了几次雨，但旱象仍未完全解除，9月下旬旱情又有新的发展。据蚌埠、芜湖、安庆三个专区10月下旬的不完全统计，受旱面积达五百多万亩。10月29日以来，全省各地普遍降雨，降雨量二十至三十毫米，旱象有了缓和。各地人民公社积极抗旱播种。芜湖、安庆两个专区一百六、七十万亩越冬粮食作物绝大部分是抗旱抢种的。横跨淮河两岸的蚌埠专区，在抗旱播种中，出动六十三万多人，采取灌水润田、带水播种和趁墒抢种等办法，每天播种八、九十万亩。很多地方批判了少数干部的畏难情绪，大大加快了种麦的进度。霍丘县三十万社员开展比干劲、比方法、比质量、比进度的红旗竞赛运动，大大推动了抗旱抢种，很快就播种了六十多万亩夏熟作物，并且达到了基肥足、宽幅条播、深沟高畦、墒平土细的要求。
  　在秋种中，各地人民公社都实行了大协作。根据秋种任务，合理地安排了劳力和畜力，大力帮助力量比较薄弱的生产队，保证这些队能够按时、按质、按量地完成秋种计划。芜湖专区大部地区今年长期干旱，秋种所用的劳力和工具要比过去增加一倍，但是由于充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，实行了劳力、畜力和工具的统一调动和安排，展开了大兵团作战和互相协作，使全专区一百五十万亩油菜，到10月20日就基本种完，比去年还提早了半个月时间。
    为了提高秋种质量，各地普遍进行了秋种农具的改革工作，全省共新制和改制深耕犁、改良耙、密植耧、牵引机二十多万件。目前已下种的冬田，普遍达到了深耕施基肥，并且做到了合理密植和畦田化。少数远田薄地，也基本消灭了浅耕、窄畦、撒播和白田下种的现象。
    最近，安徽各地公社已经掀起了趁墒抢种的高潮。
