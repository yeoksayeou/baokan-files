Raise the Colored Pencils to Defend a Happy Life
——Thoughts After Watching Three Soviet Animated Films
Zhang Guangyu

China has a puppet film based on a folk tale: "Magical Brush Ma Liang." It tells the story of a celestial being who gives a "magical brush" to a small peasant painter. This brush can paint things that benefit the working people, and it is also a weapon to destroy evil forces. This legend is also very meaningful in real life. That is to say, everyone who holds a paintbrush has the responsibility to paint all kinds of pictures that are beneficial to the people and to fight to defend the good and drive out the evil.

Recently, the "Soviet Film Week" held in China to celebrate the forty-second anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution gave me the opportunity to see the Soviet short art films: the puppet film "We Are Looking for the Sun," the animated film "The Boy from Naples" and "Bega and Little Red Riding Hood." After watching them, I was deeply moved and felt that the Soviet masters of art film production were indeed waving the colored pencils in their hands, spreading the sweet dew of defending happiness to the world: How precious is happiness! Kind people! Let us unite hand in hand to defend this priceless happy life! In the dark corners, there are still our enemies – wolves, foxes, dogs, etc. – we must recognize their cunning and insidious faces, they are baring their teeth and claws, trying every means to devour happiness. Kind people, be vigilant! The way to deal with demons is to bind them, not allow them to move, not surrender, and then eliminate them! Sitting in front of the screen, we not only appreciate the colorful, ever-changing, and interesting pictures, but also receive the education that the films give us!

The stories of these three art films are very meaningful and extremely humorous and interesting dramas. Obviously, in the world of fairy tales, it is also necessary to distinguish between light and darkness, justice and evil, good people and bad people, love and hate, in order to have realistic significance. Of course, it also needs rich imagination to help our young audiences yearn for the bright future of the motherland, yearn for the magnificent future of mankind, and set great ambitions to create those miracles that cannot be realized now. Therefore, imagination is reasonable imagination; it is not fantasy, nor is it daydreaming, but rooted in reality. Films like "We Are Looking for the Sun" are meaningful and imaginative.

Soviet art films have high artistic attainments, and the images of the characters and small animals that are created are truly unforgettable. After seeing them, I feel like I have made several more little friends. I think of the spirited steps of the little duck searching for the sun, which makes me laugh even in my dreams. Every time it takes a step, it must first draw a circle backwards with its duck foot before slowly landing. This walking posture is truly tireless to watch, and I guarantee you will love watching it more and more. Because the little rabbit is advancing side by side with the little duck, it inevitably has to take care of the duck's walking, so it also takes particularly slow steps. The posture of these steps is also very beautiful. The painter uses extremely simple ochre lines to depict the delicate state of Sleeping Beauty in the expression of the Sun Girl, especially the sleepy look in her eyes, which is very cute. The images of the Neapolitan boy and Bega, with few lines, have particularly good eyes, and their eyebrows fully reveal their intelligence, but the actions of the two children are completely different. The expressions of Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother are painted as the epitome of human goodness. How could we let them feed the greedy wolf? And the wolf's facial expression is the ultimate in cunning, and the blue-clad fairy disguised by the old goblin is so ugly that he looks a bit like Adenauer of West Germany.

The backgrounds of Soviet animated films are no longer close to the watercolor style but are slightly rendered line drawing decorative landscape paintings. I especially love those Italian landscape paintings in the film. Aren't the blue sky, red tiles, and white walls lovely? The artists use dynamic color science. The colors are bright but not excessive. Strong colors are used very appropriately. Sometimes, gray tones are used to adjust the audience's eyesight. The combination of color and lines is also very soft and rhythmic. We Chinese painters have the saying "sparing ink as if it were gold." The use of color in Soviet art films is also just right, with no wasted strokes.

After appreciating the Soviet art films, I thought: Our painters should continue to learn from the Soviet masters of animation art! Raise our colored pencils more firmly to defend our happy life, create more paintings and more art films for children, and further enrich children's cultural life!

    举起彩笔保卫幸福生活
    ——看三个苏联动画片有感
    张光宇
    我国有部根据民间传说拍摄的木偶片：“神笔马良”。它叙述一位仙翁送一支“神笔”给一个小小的农民画家，这支画笔可以画出造福于劳动人民的东西，同时也是一种毁灭恶势力的武器。这个传说，在现实生活中也很有意义。这就是说凡是手拿画笔的人，都有责任去画出种种有益于人民的图画，为保卫善良和驱除邪恶而斗争。
    最近，我国庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年举行的“苏联电影周”，使我有机会看到苏联的美术短片：木偶片“我们去找太阳”，动画片“从那波里来的孩子”和“贝佳和小红帽”。观后，深为感动，觉得苏联摄制美术片的大师们，他们的确在挥舞着手中彩笔，向世界遍洒保卫幸福的甘露：幸福是多么可贵啊！善良的人们呵！手携手地团结得紧紧地来保卫这无价之宝的幸福生活吧！阴暗的角落里还有我们的敌人——狼、狐狸、狗等等的存在，我们要识破它们狡猾阴险的嘴脸，它们正在张牙舞爪，千方百计地要来吞噬幸福。善良的人们，警惕吧！对待魔鬼的办法，就是缚住它，不许乱动，不投降，就消灭它！我们坐在银幕前，不只是欣赏了那五色缤纷、变幻无穷而有趣的画面，也受到影片给我们的教育！
    这三部美术片的故事都是很有意义的，也是极为幽默而趣味盎然的剧作。很明显，在童话世界里也要划清光明和黑暗、正义和邪恶、好人和坏人、爱和憎，这样才是有现实意义的。当然也需要有丰富的幻想，帮助我们的小观众们去向往祖国的美好前途，向往人类的壮丽的未来，并且立定大志，去创造那些现在还不能实现的奇迹。所以，幻想是合理的幻想，它不是空想，也不是想入非非，而是生根在现实的基础上。像“我们去找太阳”等就是既有意义又富于幻想的题材。
    苏联的美术片有着很高的艺术造诣，那些塑造出来的人物与小动物的形象真是令人难忘。我看到了它们之后，好像多交了几个小朋友。我想起了找寻太阳的小鸭的迈步的神气，真是在梦中也要发笑，它每走一步，必须用鸭掌先向后划一个圆圈，才慢慢地着地，这个走路的姿势，实在是百看不厌的，保证你越看越爱看它。小兔因为与小鸭并肩前进，不免要照顾一下鸭的走路，所以它也迈着特别慢的步伐，这步伐的姿式也是十分美妙的。那太阳姑娘的表情，画家用极简单的赭色的线条画出睡美人的娇态，特别那睡眼惺松的神气，十分可爱。那波里的孩子和贝佳的形象，用线不多，眼神特好，眉宇间充分流露出智慧的神气，但两个孩子的动作却迥然不同。小红帽与老祖母的神情，画得真是集人类善良面目之大成，我们哪里肯让她们喂饞狼呢？而狼的面部表情是极尽老奸巨猾的能事，老妖精伪装的蓝衣仙女，他丑恶得真有点像西德的阿登纳了。
    苏联动画片的背景，已不太接近于水彩画的笔调，而是稍微有些渲染的线描装饰风景画了。我特别爱影片中那些意大利风景画，蓝天红瓦白粉墙，难道不可爱吗？艺术家们用的是动的色彩学，色彩鲜艳但并不过分，强烈的颜色用得非常恰当，有时用些灰调子来调剂观众的目力，配色和线条结合方面也非常柔而有韵律。我们中国画家有“惜墨如金”的说法，苏联美术片的用色也正是如此恰到好处，毫无费笔。
    在欣赏了苏联美术片之后，我想到：我们的画家们，还应该继续向苏联动画艺术大师们学习！举起彩笔更坚定地来保卫我们的幸福生活，为孩子们创作更多的画，更多的美术片，更加丰富孩子们的文化生活吧！
