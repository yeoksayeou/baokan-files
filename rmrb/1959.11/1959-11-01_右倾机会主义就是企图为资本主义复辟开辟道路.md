Right Opportunism Is an Attempt to Pave the Way for Capitalist Restoration
“Red Flag” Magazine Commentator

Under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a struggle against right opportunism is currently unfolding throughout the Party. This is a continuation of the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism in our country over the past ten years under new historical conditions, and it is a very fierce and profound class struggle.

The basic program of the right opportunist elements is to oppose the Party's general line for socialist construction, to oppose the Great Leap Forward, and to oppose the people's communes. This is a program that opposes socialism and paves the way for capitalist restoration. The right opportunist elements sometimes verbally express their recognition of the Party's general line for socialist construction, but in reality, they slander the Great Leap Forward movement and the people's commune movement, which embody the general line, as "petty-bourgeois fanaticism." As Lenin exposed the usual trick used by bourgeois intellectuals under the dictatorship of the proletariat, "They always ruin everything by means of agreeing in principle but disagreeing in practice." Because the Party's general line for socialist construction has been resolutely supported by the people of the whole country, the right opportunist elements know that if they openly oppose the general line, they will immediately expose their reactionary anti-Party and anti-socialist nature. Therefore, they are accustomed to using "the means of agreeing in principle but disagreeing in practice." They "agree in principle" with the general line, but in reality, they criticize and attack the general line; they "agree in principle" with socialism, but in reality, what they yearn for is capitalism, not socialism.

Why do the right opportunist elements oppose the general line, oppose the Great Leap Forward, and oppose the people's communes? The more victoriously the socialist cause advances, the more encouraged and invigorated the broad masses of the people who demand to take the socialist road, and the more uneasy those who stubbornly stand on the bourgeois stand will feel. This is a certain truth. With the implementation of the general line, with the progress of the Great Leap Forward movement and the people's commune movement, many new things have rapidly emerged and developed in our social life, and they are mainly large-scale collective labor, large-scale mass movements in economic construction, and the continuous improvement of socialist public ownership, and so on. These new things mark the new victory of socialism, and cannot but arouse the resistance of the right opportunist elements. The right opportunist elements do not like to accelerate the speed of socialist construction and oppose the people's communes because they do not like the socialist road. Some right opportunist elements' real thoughts on the issue of the two roads in the countryside are that the people's commune is not as good as the advanced agricultural cooperative, the advanced agricultural cooperative is not as good as the elementary cooperative, and the elementary cooperative is not as good as mutual aid groups and individual farming. In short, in their view, public ownership is not as good as private ownership, collective labor is not as good as individual labor, and socialism is not as good as capitalism. Therefore, according to their logic, our countryside should not only not advance to the people's commune, but also retreat to capitalism. They attempt to use forms such as so-called "contracting production to households" to destroy the collective ownership system, restore individual farming, and make the countryside return to the capitalist road.

Right opportunist elements are representatives of bourgeois ideology, and in rural areas, they are representatives of capitalist spontaneous forces.

From the words and actions of the right opportunist elements, it can also be seen that what they dislike most is the leadership of the Party and the mass line. We advocate putting politics in command, that is, to strengthen the leadership of the Party in all undertakings, which is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the socialist cause. However, the right opportunist elements try their best to vilify the leadership of the Party and undermine the leadership of the Party. The combination of the Party's leadership and mass movements is the fundamental method in our socialist construction cause, because without the initiative and enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, the victory of socialism is unimaginable. However, the right opportunist elements regard the mass movement as a terrible disaster. The right opportunist elements say that they still advocate carrying out socialist construction, but we must ask what kind of construction they want, and what kind of socialism they are talking about. Since they advocate abolishing the firm leadership of the proletarian party and attempt to suppress the enthusiasm of the people, what socialism can there be? The "socialism" they talk about can only be the so-called "socialism" of the right-wing social democratic parties in Western Europe, only the so-called "socialism" of the Mensheviks in the Russian Revolution, only the so-called "socialism" of modern revisionism that has betrayed Marxism-Leninism. This kind of "socialism" is just another name for surrendering to the bourgeoisie.

It is not surprising that there are some right opportunist elements in our Party who oppose socialism. There are still bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals in society, and some of them have not made up their minds to transform themselves. Once there is any disturbance, they want to make waves, and their ideological emotions will inevitably be reflected in our Party. In rural areas, there are also a small number of well-to-do middle peasants who hold the idea of taking the capitalist road. They still miss the kind of "freedom" in the past that allowed them to hire workers and engage in speculative trading. They always feel uncomfortable with the socialist public ownership and collective labor. Although their income under the socialist system is constantly increasing like that of the majority of peasants, they always think that if they are given "freedom," they will be able to make a fortune individually. The idea that the people's commune is not as good as the cooperative, and the cooperative is not as good as individual farming, is the idea of this small number of well-to-do middle peasants who represent capitalist spontaneous forces. Their demands representing capitalist spontaneous forces are concentratedly reflected in the thoughts and actions of the right opportunist elements.

Obviously, the force represented by the right opportunist elements in society is only a very declining force. Those right-wing bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals who oppose socialism are already in an extremely isolated position. Although a part of the well-to-do middle peasants who represent capitalist spontaneous forces also participate in labor, their words still have a market among some working peasants, but their number is also very small among the broad masses of peasants, and their remarks dissatisfied with socialism will inevitably be resisted by the broad masses of peasants. In fact, in many rural areas, the peasant masses have already risen up to engage in reasoning debates with these well-to-do middle peasants who attempt to reverse the course towards individual economy and capitalist economy. They pointed out that the "freedom" wanted by these well-to-do middle peasants is actually a freedom that can only enable a few people to get rich while making the majority suffer. They also used facts to point out that even for the well-to-do middle peasants, the socialist road is the best road. After such debates, not only has the socialist consciousness of the peasant masses been greatly improved, but also many well-to-do middle peasants who attempted to reverse the course have had to admit that they have "lost the argument" and expressed their determination to correct their mistakes.

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out that right opportunism is the main danger facing our country at present, and fighting against right opportunism is a major task of our Party at present. The peasants say: "A grain of rat feces spoils a pot of soup." It is very clear that if the influence of right opportunism is not thoroughly eliminated, the Party's general line for socialist construction cannot be smoothly implemented, the situation of continued leap forward cannot be developed, and the people's communes cannot be further consolidated. Now we have already achieved great victories in this struggle, and we must continue to carry out this struggle thoroughly, so that the broad masses fully recognize the harmfulness of rightist ideas and rightist activities to the socialist cause. Only in this way can it be possible to educate those right opportunist elements who can still be reformed.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, under the illumination of the Party's general line, taking the socialist road is the firm will of the 650 million people. The attack of the right opportunist elements has only further raised the consciousness of the people and strengthened the fighting power of the people. After the Party issued the call to oppose rightism and boost morale, a new upsurge of mass movements has been set off on all fronts of our socialist cause, and new and great achievements in continued leap forward have been made. This fact further proves that the Party's general line and a series of new things that have emerged under the guidance of the general line are invincible, and the attempt of the right opportunists to restore capitalism in China can never be realized.

    右倾机会主义就是企图为资本主义复辟开辟道路
    “红旗”杂志评论员
    在党的八届八中全会的号召下，目前在全党正展开着反对右倾机会主义的斗争。这是我国十年来资本主义和社会主义两条道路的斗争在新的历史条件下的继续，是一场很激烈的、很深刻的阶级斗争。
    右倾机会主义分子的基本纲领就是反对党的社会主义建设的总路线，反对大跃进，反对人民公社。这是一个反对社会主义而为资本主义复辟开辟道路的纲领。右倾机会主义分子在口头上有时也表示承认党的社会主义建设的总路线，但是在实际上，他们把体现总路线的大跃进运动和人民公社运动，污蔑为“小资产阶级的狂热性”。正像列宁揭露在无产阶级专政条件下资产阶级知识分子使用的惯技时所说的那样，“他们总是用原则上同意而实际上不同意的手段来葬送一切”。由于党的社会主义建设总路线得到了全国人民的坚决拥护，右倾机会主义分子知道，他们如果明目张胆地公然反对总路线，就会一下子暴露出他们反党反社会主义的反动本质，因此，他们惯于使用“原则上同意而实际上不同意的手段”。他们“原则上同意”总路线，实际上非难和攻击总路线；他们“原则上同意”社会主义，实际上他们所向往的是资本主义，而不是社会主义。
    为什么右倾机会主义分子要反对总路线，反对大跃进，反对人民公社呢？社会主义事业越是胜利地向前推进，要求走社会主义道路的广大人民群众就越是鼓舞奋发，而那顽固地站在资产阶级立场上的一些人就越是感到坐卧不宁，这是一定的道理。随着总路线的贯彻执行，随着大跃进运动和人民公社运动的进展，在我们的社会生活中迅速地涌现出和发展了许多新的事物，它们主要的就是，大规模的集体劳动，经济建设中的大规模的群众运动，社会主义公有制的不断提高，等等。这些新的事物标志着社会主义的新的胜利，也不能不引起右倾机会主义分子的反抗。右倾机会主义分子不喜欢加快社会主义建设速度，反对人民公社，就因为他们不喜欢社会主义道路，有些右倾机会主义分子在农村中的两条道路的斗争问题上的真正想法是，人民公社不如高级农业合作社，高级农业合作社不如初级社，而初级社又不如互助组和单干。总之，在他们看来，公有不如私有，集体劳动不如个体劳动，社会主义不如资本主义。所以按照他们的逻辑，我们的农村不但不应当前进到人民公社，而且还应当倒退到资本主义。他们企图用所谓“包产到户”之类的形式来破坏集体所有制，恢复单干，使农村重新走上资本主义的道路。
    右倾机会主义分子是资产阶级思潮的代表，而在农村中是资本主义自发势力的代表。
    从右倾机会主义分子的言论和行动中，还可以看到，他们所最不喜欢的是党的领导和群众路线。我们主张政治挂帅，也就是要在一切事业中加强党的领导，这是社会主义事业胜利的根本保证。但是右倾机会主义分子却尽力诋毁党的领导，破坏党的领导。党的领导和群众运动相结合是我们社会主义建设事业中的根本方法，因为离开了广大人民群众的主动性和积极性，社会主义的胜利是不能设想的。可是右倾机会主义分子却把群众运动看成是可怕的灾难。右倾机会主义分子说，他们还是主张进行社会主义建设的，但是我们必须追问，他们所要的是什么建设，他们所说的是什么社会主义。他们既然是主张取消无产阶级政党的坚定的领导，企图压抑人民群众的积极性，那还会有什么社会主义呢？他们所说的“社会主义”，只能是西欧的右翼社会党的所谓“社会主义”，只能是俄国革命中的孟什维克的所谓“社会主义”，只能是背叛了马克思列宁主义的现代修正主义的所谓“社会主义”，这种“社会主义”不过是向资产阶级投降的别名罢了。
    在我们党内出现这样一些反对社会主义的右倾机会主义分子，并不是什么奇怪的事情。社会上还存在着资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子，他们中间有一部分人还没有下定决心改造自己，一遇风吹草动，就想兴风作浪，他们的思想情绪必然会在我们党内有所反映。在农村中也还有一小部分富裕中农抱着走资本主义道路的思想。他们仍然怀恋着过去那种可以雇工、可以做投机买卖的“自由”，对于社会主义的公有制和集体劳动总觉得过不惯。尽管在社会主义制度下他们的收入也和广大农民一样不断地有所增加，但是他们总是想，如果让他们“自由”，他们就能够搞个人发财。那种以为人民公社不如合作社，合作又不如单干的想法，就是这小部分代表资本主义自发势力的富裕中农的想法。他们的代表资本主义自发势力的要求，在右倾机会主义分子的思想和行动中得到了集中的反映。
    显然，右倾机会主义分子在社会上所代表的力量，只是一个十分衰微的力量。反对社会主义的那些右翼的资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子已经处于极为孤立的地位。代表资本主义自发势力的一部分富裕中农，虽然因为自己也参加劳动，他们的话在一部分劳动农民中间还有市场，但是他们的人数在广大农民群众中也是很少的，他们的不满意社会主义的言论，必然要受到广大农民群众的抵制。事实上，许多地方的农村中，农民群众早就已经起来同这些企图向个体经济、资本主义经济开倒车的富裕中农展开了说理辩论，他们指出，这些富裕中农所要的“自由”，其实是只能够使少数人发财而使多数人受苦受难的自由，他们也用事实指出，即使对于富裕中农，也只有社会主义道路才是最好的道路。经过这样的辩论，不仅大大提高了农民群众的社会主义觉悟，而且使得不少企图开倒车的富裕中农也只能承认自己“理输”，并且表示要决心改正他们的错误了。
    党的八届八中全会指出，右倾机会主义是我国当前的主要危险，同右倾机会主义进行斗争，是我们党当前的一个主要任务。农民们说：“一粒老鼠粪，搞坏一锅汤”。事情非常明显，如果不彻底肃清右倾机会主义的影响，党的社会主义建设总路线就不可能顺利地贯彻执行，继续跃进的形势就不可能发展，人民公社就不可能进一步巩固。现在我们已经在这一场斗争中取得了极大的胜利，我们一定要继续彻底地进行这个斗争，使广大群众充分认识右倾思想和右倾活动对社会主义事业的危害性。也只有这样，才有可能教育那些还可以改造的右倾机会主义分子本人。
    在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下，在党的总路线的照耀下，走社会主义道路，这是六亿五千万人民的坚决意志。右倾机会主义分子的进攻只是更提高了人民群众的觉悟，更加强了人民群众的战斗力。在党发出了反右倾、鼓干劲的号召以后，我们社会主义事业的各个战线上都掀起了群众运动的新高潮，都取得了继续跃进的新的巨大成就。这个事实进一步证明了，党的总路线和在总路线的指导下所出现的一系列的新事物都是不可战胜的，右倾机会主义者企图使资本主义在中国复辟，这是任何时候都不能够实现的。
