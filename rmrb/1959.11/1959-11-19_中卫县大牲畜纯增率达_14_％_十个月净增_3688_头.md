This newspaper reports from Yinchuan on November 18th: With the continuous manifestation of the superiority of the People's Communes, the slow development of large livestock in Zhongwei County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, has been completely changed. The county's large livestock increased from 26,333 heads at the end of last year to 30,021 heads, a net increase of 14%.

According to statistics from early November, of the 7,149 breeding-age female animals in the county that should have been mated this year, 6,879 have been mated, of which 5,825 have conceived, with a conception rate of 84.6%, an increase of 5.9% compared to last year, basically achieving full mating and conception. The breeding of improved varieties has also greatly increased compared to previous years. This year, female animals mated with improved breeds such as Qin Chuan cattle, Guanzhong donkeys, Dutch cattle, and Soviet Don horses accounted for 41% of the total number of mated female animals.

The Zhongwei County Party Committee, in the development of large livestock, first emphasized the organizational leadership of developing large livestock. From the county Party committee to the production teams, there are dedicated personnel responsible for leading animal husbandry work. Since last winter and this spring, the superior conditions of communization have been fully utilized, and corresponding specialized institutions and professional teams have been established from top to bottom. Currently, in addition to specialized institutions such as the county's Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Work Station, Veterinary Quarantine Station, Grassland Work Station, and Central Artificial Insemination Station, all five People's Communes in the county have also established Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Work Stations, and more than 40 production brigades have established breeding stations, with some production teams even having breeding groups. The number of professionals engaged in animal husbandry work has expanded to more than 100.

Zhongwei County also grasped several important links in the great development of large livestock:

In terms of livestock breeding, this year, each commune implemented the method of "three combinations" to strengthen livestock breeding. Namely: combining regular breeding with shock breeding, combining natural mating with artificial insemination, and combining improved mating with native mating. In order to truly achieve "guaranteed mating, guaranteed pregnancy, and guaranteed survival," the production teams also universally insisted on implementing the following systems: One is a regulation that female animals are given a reduction or cessation of labor for half a month to a month before and after pregnancy. The other is "three guarantees and one reward." The three guarantees are to ensure the survival and growth of young animals, ensure the good condition of draft animals, and ensure the pregnancy of pregnant animals. Upon completion of this requirement, a reward is given. The other is that each feeding group implements a "six fix" system of fixed person, fixed animal, fixed task, fixed manure accumulation, fixed remuneration, and fixed breeding.

In terms of feed, Zhongwei County also combined short-term arrangements with long-term plans, grasping both the shock movement of fodder storage and the basic construction of fodder. Last year, after the county's communization, due to unified planning and rational allocation of labor, the activity of storing fodder was effectively carried out, and fodder was basically self-sufficient last winter and this spring. This year, in order to fundamentally solve the feed problem, after unified planning by the People's Communes, a total of 27 pastures were cultivated in the county, with an area of 1,740 square kilometers. For some pastures that were originally short of water, wells were also dug and flood ponds were built to solve the water use problem of the fodder bases. More than 5,000 mu of feed crops were also cultivated and planted. In addition, through the implementation of shock fodder storage movement, the People's Communes throughout the county stored more than 19 million jin of wild grass and silage.

Preventing and controlling livestock diseases is also a crucial measure. Zhongwei County conscientiously implemented the policy of prevention first, treatment second in terms of veterinary epidemic prevention and control. More than 300,000 head/times of livestock were vaccinated during the year, greatly reducing epidemics and abnormal deaths.

At present, the People's Communes in Zhongwei County are generally conducting a major inspection to protect livestock through the winter, actively repairing sheds, increasing cold-proof equipment, conscientiously protecting pregnant animals, and nurturing young animals, striving for a greater livestock harvest next year.

### 中卫县大牲畜纯增率达14％  十个月净增3688头

    中卫县大牲畜纯增率达14％
    十个月净增3688头
    本报银川18日电　随着人民公社优越性的不断发挥，宁夏回族自治区中卫县过去大牲畜发展缓慢的局面已经完全改观。全县的大牲畜由去年年底的二万六千三百三十三头增加到三万零二十一头，纯增率达到14％。
    根据11月初的统计，今年全县应配种的七千一百四十九头适龄母畜中，受配的已达六千八百七十九头，其中已经受胎的有五千八百二十五头，受胎率达到84.6％，比去年提高5.9％，基本实现了全配满怀。优良品种的繁殖也比往年大大增加，今年用秦川牛、关中驴、荷兰牛、苏联顿河马等优良种畜交配的母畜，占到交配母畜总数的41％。
    中卫县委在大牲畜的发展中，首先重视对发展大家畜的组织领导工作。从县委到生产队，都有专人负责领导畜牧工作。从去冬今春以来，充分利用公社化的优越条件，从上到下建立了相应的专业机构和专业队伍。目前除县上设有畜牧兽医工作站、兽医检疫站、草原工作站、中心人工授精站等专业机构外，全县五个人民公社也都建立了畜牧兽医工作站，四十多个生产大队都建立了配种站，有些生产小队还有配种组。从事畜牧工作的专业人员已扩大到一百多人。
    中卫县在大牲畜的大发展中，还抓住了几个重要环节：
    在牲畜配种方面，今年各公社都实行了“三个结合”的办法，加强牲畜的繁殖。即：常年配种和突击配种相结合，本交配种和人工授精配种相结合，改良交配和土种交配相结合。为了真正做到“保配、保胎、保成活”，各生产队还普遍坚持执行了这样一些制度：一种是规定在母畜怀胎前后，减轻或停止使役半个月到一个月。一种是“三保一奖”。三保就是幼畜保活、保壮，耕畜保膘，孕畜保胎。完成这一要求时，即给以奖励。另一种是每个饲养小组都实行了定人、定畜、定任务、定积肥、定报酬、定繁殖的“六定”制度。
    在饲料方面，中卫县也把短期安排和长远打算结合起来，既抓突击性的贮草运动，也搞饲草的基本建设。去年全县公社化后，由于统筹安排，合理调配劳动力，有效地开展贮备饲草活动，去冬今春饲草基本达到自给。今年，为了从根本上解决饲料问题，经过各人民公社的统一规划，全县共培育草场二十七处，面积有一千七百四十平方公里，对有些原来缺水的草场，还打了井，修了涝池，解决了饲草基地的用水问题，开垦种植的饲料作物也有五千多亩。此外，通过开展突击性的储草运动，全县各人民公社贮备的野草和青贮草就有一千九百多万斤。
    防治牲畜疫病也是一项关键性的措施。中卫县在兽疫防治方面认真贯彻执行预防为主、治疗为辅的方针，一年当中经过预防注射的牲畜达三十多万头次，使疫病和不正常的死亡现象大大减少。
    目前，中卫县各人民公社正普遍进行保畜过冬大检查，积极修补棚圈，增加防寒设备，认真保护孕畜，抚育幼畜，争取明年牲畜更大丰收。
