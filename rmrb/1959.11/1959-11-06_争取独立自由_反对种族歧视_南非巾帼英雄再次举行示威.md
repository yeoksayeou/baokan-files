Xinhua News Agency, Cape Town, November 5th: Some African women in the Union of South Africa held demonstrations on the 3rd, carrying placards to protest against the white government issuing "passes" to African women to enforce racial discrimination policies. The demonstrators refused to have the photos taken that were required for the "passes" and clashed with the white government police who came to suppress them. More than a dozen African women were arrested.

While persistently carrying out the struggle against the issuance of "passes," South African African women are also launching struggles across the country, especially in Natal in the southwest, against increased taxes, protesting the white government's prevention of their men from entering cities to find work, protesting the white authorities' conspiracy to poison their poultry, and protesting police brutality, all in the fight against racial discrimination and for democracy and the right to live. Ignoring their legitimate demands, the white government has carried out frantic suppression and arrests against them. Since mid-August, in Natal province alone, several thousand African women have been arrested.

According to a report in the South African "New Age" weekly in October, the arrested African women are still persisting in their struggle in prison.

Xinhua News Agency, Cape Town: Four organizations in the Union of South Africa issued a joint statement on the evening of September 29, condemning the South African government's decision to exile Mrs. Mafeikeng, a female trade union chairman and African mother of eleven children, to a place 700 miles away from her hometown.

The four organizations are the African National Congress of the Western Cape Province, the South African Democratic Congress, the South African Colored People's Organization, and the South African Trade Union Congress.

The statement pointed out that Mrs. Mafeikeng had not committed any crime but was sentenced to exile. The statement said, "Her crime is that, as the chairman of the African Fruit and Canning Workers' Union and the vice-chairman of the African National Congress Women's League, she struggled to improve the situation of African workers and to fight for the right of African women to move freely in their birthplace."

The African National Congress also called on the people to protest to the South African Parliament and the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, demanding that Mrs. Mafeikeng be allowed to return to her hometown.

    争取独立自由　反对种族歧视
    南非巾帼英雄再次举行示威
    据新华社5日讯　开普敦消息：南非联邦的一些非洲妇女在3日拿着标语牌举行示威，抗议白人政府为执行种族歧视政策向非洲妇女颁发“通行证”。示威者表示拒绝拍摄“通行证”上要用的照片，并且同前来镇压的白人政府警察发生冲突。有十多名非洲妇女被捕。
    南非非洲妇女在坚持进行反对颁发“通行证”的斗争的同时，还在全国各地，特别是在西南部的纳塔尔州展开着反对增加税收、抗议白人政府不让她们的男人进入城市找工作、抗议白人当局阴谋用毒药毒害她们的家禽和抗议警察的暴行等反对种族歧视和争取民主、生活权利的斗争。白人政府不顾她们的正当要求，对她们进行了疯狂的镇压和逮捕，从8月中旬以来，仅在纳塔尔一州，就有好几千名非洲妇女被捕。
    据10月份的一期南非“新世纪”周刊报道，被捕的非洲妇女在监狱中仍然坚持着斗争。
    据新华社讯　开普敦消息：南非联邦四个团体9月29日晚发表联合声明，谴责南非政府决定把一个工会女主席、有十一个孩子的非洲母亲马费肯夫人流放到离家乡七百英里以外的地方去。
    这四个团体是在好望角州西部地区的非洲人国民大会、南非民主大会、南非有色人组织和南非工会大会。
    声明指出，马费肯夫人没有犯任何罪，可是被判处流放。声明说，“她的罪名就是，作为非洲果品和装罐工人工会的主席和非洲人国民大会妇女联盟副主席，她为改善非洲工人的情况和争取非洲妇女在她们的出生地自由行动的权利而斗争。”
    非洲人国民大会还号召人民向南非的议会以及班图行政和发展部长抗议，要求让马费肯夫人回到她的家乡去。
