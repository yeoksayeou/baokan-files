    Wind and Snow Cannot Stop the Leap Forward Vehicle
    ——In Memory of the Excellent Automobile Driver Chen Wantang
    Chen Wantang is the group leader of the Youth Driving Team and a first-class automobile driver of the Third Team of Chongqing Automobile Transportation Company. From January to August this year, he overfulfilled the state plan by 90.13%, completed the annual plan more than five months ahead of schedule, and achieved an average monthly vehicle-tonnage production of 12,515 ton-kilometers. He broke the 20,000 ton-kilometer mark in May and August, creating the highest record of monthly vehicle-tonnage production in Chongqing. In November 1958, the Party sent their team to Guizhou to rush-transport pig iron. The Sichuan-Guizhou Road is mountainous and has many steep slopes, especially the Lou Mountain Pass, which is steep and slippery, making driving very difficult. Moreover, the road leading to the iron factory was a newly built simple road, and generally no vehicles traveled on it at night. However, Chen Wantang was not intimidated by these difficulties. After discussing with his comrades, he decided to break the routine and implement night transportation. The slopes were steep and slippery, and the vehicles could not climb up, so they put on anti-skid chains and finally drove the vehicles to the side of the blast furnace. As soon as the iron cooled, it was immediately loaded and transported away. This courageous action motivated other drivers, and they unprecedentedly carried out day and night shock transportation on the snow-covered Sichuan-Guizhou Road, transporting every ton available and overfulfilling the urgent task of rushing pig iron. One day in December 1958, Chen Wantang arrived at the Wanyuan County Railway Station in the Dabashan Mountains with goods from Chongqing at more than 2 a.m. He heard that "the Wanyuan Iron Factory has no coke, and there is a risk of production being suspended the next day." It was raining heavily at this time. It was more than 160 kilometers round trip from Wanyuan to Xuanhan to transport coke, and most of it was newly built simple roads, narrow and slippery. However, Chen Wantang unhesitatingly stepped forward and mobilized a young driver to join him in undertaking this arduous task. Along the way, he carefully held the steering wheel, fearing that the vehicle would overturn and cause an accident, delaying the transportation of coke. When passing Yunfeng Mountain, the mountain was high and the slope was steep, and the road surface was so slippery that the tires kept spinning, and the vehicle could not climb up. Chen Wantang got out and used his hands to scoop up gravel and place it under the wheels, paving a section and driving a section, finally overcoming the many difficulties, transporting the coke back to Wanyuan, and ensuring steel production. Because Chen Wantang worked hard and practically, was not afraid of difficulties, and took the lead in charging forward, not only did he comprehensively and excellently complete the transportation plan himself, but the average monthly vehicle-tonnage production of the team he led also exceeded 10,000 ton-kilometers in the fourth quarter of 1958, saving 12,926 liters of gasoline.
    In order to ensure the completion of the transportation task, Chen Wantang actively took the lead in responding to the Party's call, vigorously engaging in one-vehicle double-trailers and triple-trailers, and always insisted on trailer transportation in any situation. In February this year, Guizhou Province allocated more than 10,000 tons of pig iron and manganese ore to Chongqing, and the Party Committee of the Transportation Company issued a call to the drivers to engage in trailer transportation, and transferred more than 80 vehicles including Chen Wantang to undertake this task. To complete this task, it was necessary to fight against the dangerous and harsh natural environment. The Sichuan-Guizhou Road had to pass through famous dangerous passes such as Diaosiyan, Seventy-Two Bends, Lou Mountain Pass, Liangfeng Pass, and Jiudian Pass. These mountains were all two or three thousand meters above sea level. Although it was the warm spring season, snowflakes were still flying on the mountains, and the roads were icy and slippery. When encountering heavy fog, it was even more difficult to distinguish the direction. Some drivers said: "It is possible to tow a few more trailers on flat ground, but it is impossible to tow trailers on the rugged Sichuan-Guizhou Road..." But Chen Wantang thought: This is a glorious task entrusted by the Party, and no matter how difficult it is, it must be completed. Therefore, based on the principle of automobile off-roading, he actively proposed to the branch to install a reduction gear. The Party supported his proposal, and with the help of his comrades, he found an old ZIS-151 reduction gear and installed it on the vehicle. The first test of towing a double trailer failed because of lack of experience and heavy rain, and the second trailer slipped into the ditch. But he said without discouragement: "I am a Communist Party member. If it doesn't succeed once, I will try it twice. Difficulties will eventually surrender." He pondered hard on the reason for the trailer's slippage and asked experienced drivers for advice. During the second test, he asked someone else to drive the car while he sat in the carriage and carefully observed. The biting north wind wrapped in snowflakes beat him, and his clothes were soaked, but he ignored these and still insisted on paying attention to the driving situation of the car, and finally found the reason for the slippage - the hook ring of the trailer was too large. Subsequently, he reduced the hook ring, and then, fully loaded with 9.5 tons of supplies, moved forward through the clouds and mist on the high mountains, breaking the superstition that trailer transportation could not be carried out in high mountains and that vehicles could not travel at night. In this way, the transportation capacity was more than doubled. In March this year, due to the need for steel and manganese ore transportation, the leaders transferred their team from the Sichuan-Guizhou line to Jiaoding Mountain in Chengdu to Xichang and western Ya'an. Jiaoding Mountain is 3,800 meters above sea level, and it is covered with snow all year round, with heavy fog and slippery roads, making it very difficult for vehicles to travel. No one had ever tried trailer transportation on this road. Chen Wantang was determined to lead all the comrades in the team to tow the trailers directly into the mines and speed up vehicle turnover. On the day of departure, they encountered a heavy snowstorm on the way, and the road surface was muddy, and the train could not climb up. At this time, he thought: "The Party has repeatedly taught us that the more difficult it is, the more we must break superstitions and go all out. Today, we must not leave the car halfway. We must bring the trailer up the mountain." So he immediately studied with the comrades in the team and adopted the method of "casting a long line to catch big fish," detaching the trailer, first driving the main vehicle to a relatively flat place on the slope, then tying the steel wire rope to the trailer and using the main vehicle to tow it. The trailer was finally dragged onto the muddy steep slope. Jiaoding Mountain was conquered, shortening the journey from Chengdu to Jiaoding Mountain in Ya'an from the original five and a half days to three days.
    Chen Wantang often said to others: "To be a good driver for the people, we must first establish a high sense of responsibility as masters of our own affairs and avoid accidents. To achieve this, it is impossible without learning modestly and studying diligently." When he saw the news in the newspaper that Liu Hanqing, a driver of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, had created a steam fuel-saving device, he actively studied and combined his own car's conditions with the fuel-saving experience of the team's driver Lu Xiji to conduct research and experiments. He installed steam-saving devices, air fuel-saving devices, and anti-knock fuel-saving devices on his car, so that his car saved fuel every month; then he helped the team achieve fuel savings for every car. From January to August this year, he has saved 1,566 liters of gasoline, and the interval mileage between major repairs has reached 324,032 kilometers. Because he learns modestly and earnestly implements the "diligent inspection, diligent maintenance, and diligent cleaning" three diligent maintenance experience, and at the same time explores the operating experience of "one-pedal gear shifting, uniform refueling, and no sudden jerking or hard towing," he has maintained safe, fuel-efficient, and high-yield results for seven years as if it were one day, achieving an all-round leap forward.

    风雪难阻跃进车
    ——记优秀的汽车驾驶员陈万堂
    陈万堂是重庆市汽车运输公司三队青年行车小组组长、一级汽车驾驶员。他从今年1月到8月份超额90.13％完成了国家计划，提前五个多月完成了全年计划，平均车吨月产达到一万二千五百一十五吨公里，5、8两月突破了两万吨公里大关，创造了重庆市车吨月产的最高纪录。1958年11月，党派他们小组去贵州抢运生铁。川黔路山多坡大，途中的娄山关，更是坡陡路滑，行车非常艰难。而通向铁厂的道路是新修的简易公路，一般在晚上都不行车。但陈万堂并没有被这些困难吓住，他和同志们研究后，决定打破常规，实行夜间运输。坡陡路滑，车子开不上去，他们就挂上防滑练条，终于把车子开到了高炉旁，铁一冷却就马上装车运走。这种勇敢的行动带动了其他的驾驶员，在冰雪连绵的川黔路上破天荒地实行了日夜突击运输，作到有一吨运一吨，并超额完成了抢运生铁的紧急任务。1958年12月的一天，陈万堂由重庆运百货到达大巴山的万源县车站时，已是深夜两点多钟了，他听说“万源铁厂没有焦炭了，第二天就有停产的危险”。这时雨下得很大。由万源到宣汉运焦炭，往返要跑一百六十多公里，而且多是新修的简易公路，又窄又滑。可是陈万堂毫不犹豫地挺身而出，动员了一个青年驾驶员和自己一道，担任了这个艰巨的任务。一路上，他小心谨慎地握着方向盘，生怕翻车肇事，耽误焦炭运输。途中经过云峰山，山高坡陡，路面滑得轮胎直打空转，车子爬不上去。陈万堂便下来用手捧碎石垫在车轮下，铺一段，走一段，终于战胜了重重困难，把焦炭运回万源，保证了钢铁生产。由于陈万堂苦干、实干，不怕困难，带头冲锋，不仅他自己全面、出色地完成了运输计划，他所领导的小组在1958年第四季度平均车吨月产也超过了万吨公里，节约汽油一万二千九百二十六公升。
    陈万堂为了保证完成运输任务，他积极带头响应党的号召，大搞一车双挂和三挂，不论在任何情况下，都始终坚持拖挂运输。今年2月，贵州省拨给重庆一万多吨生铁和锰矿，运输公司党委向驾驶员发出拖挂运输的号召，并调了陈万堂等八十多辆车去担任这一任务。要完成这个任务，就必须同艰险恶劣的自然环境作斗争。川黔路要经过有名的吊丝岩、七十二拐、娄山关、凉风垭、酒店垭等险道难关，这些山拔海都是二、三千米，虽是春暖季节，山上仍然雪花飞扬，冰冻路滑，遇到大雾，更是云雾缭绕，很难辨明方向。有的驾驶员说：“在平地多拖几个挂车也可以，要在山路崎岖的川黔公路上拖挂，根本不行……”可是陈万堂想：这是党交给的光荣任务，再困难也要完成。于是他根据汽车越野的原理，积极向支部提出安装加力箱的建议。党支持了他的建议，在同志们的帮助下，找了一个吉斯151的旧加力箱安装在车上。第一次试验拖双挂，因为缺乏经验，又遇到大雨，挂车摇摆太大，第二节挂车滑下沟去了。但他毫不灰心地说：“我是一个共产党员，一次不成功，再来二次，困难终究是要投降的。”他一面苦苦思索挂车滑钩的原因，一面向有经验的驾驶员请教。在第二次试验时，他请别人帮他开车，自己坐在车箱上细心观察。刺骨的北风裹着雪花向他扑打着，浑身衣服湿透了，但他不管这些，仍然坚持注意观察车子行驶的情况，终于找到了滑钩的原因——挂车的钩环太大了。随后，他改小了钩环，便满载着九吨半物资在高山上穿云掠雾，向前挺进，从此打破了高山不能搞拖挂运输，不能夜间行车的迷信。就这样，使运力又增加了一倍以上。今年3月，因钢铁、锰矿运输的需要，领导上又把他们小组，从川黔线调到了成都到西昌和雅安西部的轿顶山。轿顶山拔海三千八百米，终年积雪，雾大路滑，汽车行驶很困难，拖挂运输在这条公路上还没有人尝试过。陈万堂决心带领全组同志把挂车直接拖进矿山，加快车辆周转。出发那天，途中遇到一场大雪，路面泥泞，列车爬不上去。这时他想到：“党一再教导我们，越困难越要破除迷信，鼓足干劲，今天决不能在中途把车摆下，一定要把挂车带上山去。”于是立即和小组的同志们一起研究，采取“放长线，钓大鱼”的办法，把挂车摘下，先把主车开到坡上较平坦的地方，然后用钢丝绳系在挂车上，用主车拖，挂车终于拖上了泥泞的陡坡。轿顶山被征服了，使成都到雅安轿顶山的路程由原来需要五天半的时间缩短到三天。
    陈万堂常对别人说：“作一个人民的好驾驶员，必须首先树立高度的主人翁责任感，不能肇事。要作到这一点，不虚心学习，不刻苦钻研是不行的。”当他在报上看到重庆钢铁公司驾驶员刘汉清创造蒸气节油器的消息时，他便积极学习，结合自己的汽车的情况和本队驾驶员陆锡骥的节油经验，进行研究试验，在自己车上安装了蒸气节约器、空气节油器、抗爆节油器，使自己开的车子月月节油；接着便帮助小组达到车车节油。今年1至8月，他已节约汽油一千五百六十六公升，大修间隔里程达到三十二万四千零三十二公里。由于他虚心学习，认真贯彻“勤检查、勤保养、勤清洁”的三勤保养经验，同时摸索出“一脚换档，均匀加油，不猛冲硬拖”的操作经验，因而，七年如一日地一直保持着安全、节油、高产的成绩，达到了全面跃进。
