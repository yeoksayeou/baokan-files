Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 20th - The heads of Indian reactionary parties, who have consistently acted as anti-China vanguards, are now doing everything possible to obstruct the Sino-Indian governments from holding talks on the border issue between the two countries.

The pro-American and anti-communist chairman of the Indian Praja Socialist Party, Mehta, clamored in Bombay on the 11th against India negotiating the border issue with China. He said he did not want the Indian Prime Minister to "sit at the conference table with the Chinese for talks." He also said that what happened on the border was not about to disappear and that there was no possibility of achieving a solution. He even said that the history of People's China made him inclined to believe that the Sino-Indian border issue would not be resolved quickly.

The Kerala State Committee of the Praja Socialist Party, taking advantage of the upcoming mid-term elections in the state, issued a so-called "election manifesto," falsely accusing China of "aggression" and attacking the Indian Communist Party for "taking an anti-national attitude on the border issue."

The notorious former leader of the Praja Socialist Party, Narayan, also made every effort to discredit Premier Zhou Enlai's reasonable proposal for both China and India to withdraw 20 kilometers each at a gathering in Jaipur on the 15th. He nonsensically claimed that even if the Chinese army withdrew 20 kilometers, it would still remain on "Indian territory." He clamored that before India held negotiations with China on the border issue, China must first withdraw from the "places it has invaded."

Atal Bihari Vajpayee, secretary of the Indian People's League, in order to oppose Sino-Indian negotiations, actually described Premier Zhou Enlai's letter as "a shameless attempt to put the aggressor on an equal footing with the victim." Vajpayee viciously said that the Chinese Premier's proposal had "dangerous and sinister implications that should be immediately rejected, and the Chinese should be firmly and decisively told that negotiations on even minor border adjustments are impossible before the withdrawal of the aggression." He also created a strange argument, saying that "if India agrees to the recent proposal of the Chinese Premier, it will lose its position in the eyes of the world."

In a resolution passed by the People's League organization in Delhi at a gathering on the 15th, it clamored that there should be no negotiations with Zhou Enlai until China first "withdraws from the Indian territory it has invaded"; the resolution also incited the Indian government to "determine a clear time limit for the withdrawal of Chinese troops," otherwise, the Indian government should take measures to "drive them out." The resolution advocated that India's "entire northern border should be placed under military control and barracks should be established along the border," and it also advocated "training and arming the border people by recruiting border militias." The resolution also demanded that the Indian government ban the Communist Party and take "all measures to stop its forces of sabotage within the country." It was reported that Vajpayee also attacked China and the Indian Communist Party at the meeting. He spread rumors and incited, saying, "It is reckless to allow a party (referring to the Indian Communist Party) loyal to China to act freely when China is desperately knocking on our door with mortars and cannons."

Dogra, leader of the Jammu and Kashmir People's Association, used the most vicious language to curse the Chinese government's proposal for a peaceful settlement of the Sino-Indian border issue, saying that "this proposal is like a bandit entering someone's house and then suggesting to the people living in the house that they should all leave the house in order to maintain peace." Therefore, he warned the Indian government not to accept this proposal.

Ram, the general secretary of the Indian "Bolshevik Party," also made wild remarks in New Delhi on the 16th, saying that China's withdrawal proposal was only "a further step in deceiving the Indian people by complicating the issue."

After wantonly attacking China on the Sino-Indian border issue at a gathering held in Ambala on the 15th, Ram Singh, chairman of the Hindu Mahasabha, asked Indian youth to implement a compulsory military training system so that they could be recruited to deal with "critical moments" when necessary.

Langa, chairman of the Swatantra Party, also nonsensically said on the 15th that China's withdrawal proposal was "absurd." Although Langa verbally expressed his agreement that India should continue to pursue a policy of non-alignment, he fiercely attacked Nehru's statement, in which Nehru said that India neither sought military assistance from any country nor participated in any major power bloc. Langa said that Nehru's statements did not strengthen India, but "made those who wanted to help this country unwilling to sympathize with it."

### 印度反动政党头子充当反华急先锋  百般阻挠中印谈判边界问题

    印度反动政党头子充当反华急先锋
    百般阻挠中印谈判边界问题
    新华社20日讯　新德里消息：一向充当反华急先锋的印度反动政党的头子，现在又百般阻挠中印两国政府就两国的边界问题举行会谈。
    亲美、反共的印度人民社会党主席梅达11日在孟买叫嚷，反对印度同中国谈判边界问题。他说，他不希望印度总理“同中国人一起坐在会议桌边举行会谈”。他还说，边境上所发生的事情不是即将消逝的，并说没有可能取得解决。他甚至说，人民中国的历史使他倾向于认为，中印边界问题不会很快解决。
    人民社会党喀拉拉邦委员会利用这个邦即将举行期中选举这一机会，发表所谓“竞选宣言”，诬蔑中国“侵略”，并且攻击印度共产党“在边界问题上是采取反民族的态度”。
    臭名远扬的前人民社会党首领纳拉扬15日在斋浦尔的一次集会上，也竭力诋毁周恩来总理提出中印双方各后撤二十公里的合理建议。他胡说什么即使中国军队后撤二十公里，它将仍然停留在“印度领土”上。他叫嚷在印度同中国就边界问题举行谈判以前，中国首先要从它“侵略的地方”撤走。
    印度人民同盟书记巴志帕伊为了反对中印举行谈判，居然把周恩来总理的信件说成是“想把侵略者同受害者放在同等地位的一个无耻的意图”。巴志帕伊恶毒地说，中国总理的建议有着“危险的和阴险的含意，应当立即予以拒绝，并且应当坚决而果断地告诉中国人，在撤退侵略以前，甚至不可能就较小的边界调整举行谈判。”他还制造出一种奇怪的论调，说什么“如果印度同意中国总理最近的建议，它将在世界的眼中失去它的立场。”
    在德里的人民同盟组织15日在一次集会上通过的决议中叫嚷说，在中国没有首先从它“所侵略的印度领土上撤退”以前，不要同周恩来谈判；决议还怂恿印度政府“确定中国军队撤退的明确时限”，否则，印度政府应该采取措施“把他们赶出去”。决议主张印度“整个北部边境应该置于军队控制下，并且沿边境建立兵营”，它还主张“通过征募边界民兵的办法训练和武装边界人民”。决议又要印度政府禁止共产党，并采取“一切措施来制止它在国内进行破坏的力量”。据报道，巴志帕伊也曾经在这个会上攻击中国和印度共产党。他造谣煽动说，“当中国用迫击炮和大炮拼命敲我们的门时，让一个忠于中国的政党（指印度共产党）自由行事是轻率的”。
    查谟和克什米尔人民协会领袖道格拉使用了最恶毒的语言来咒骂中国政府关于和平解决中印边界问题的建议，说什么“这项建议就像是土匪进入人家的屋子，然后向住在屋子里的人建议，为了保持和平，他们都应该离开屋子。”因此，他警告印度政府不要接受这项建议。
    印度“布尔什维克党”总书记拉姆16日在新德里也大放厥词，说中国的撤军建议只是“用使问题复杂化的办法来欺骗印度人的进一步的步骤”。
    印度教大会主席拉姆·辛格15日在阿巴拉举行的一次集会上，就中印边界问题大肆攻击中国以后，要印度青年实行义务军训制，以便必要时征募他们来对付“危急时刻”。
    自由党主席兰加15日也胡说什么中国的撤军建议是“荒谬的”。兰加虽然在口头上表示同意印度继续执行不结盟政策，但是他大肆攻击尼赫鲁的声明，尼赫鲁曾经说，印度既不要求任何国家的军事援助，也不参加任何大国集团。兰加说尼赫鲁的这些声明没有加强印度，“反而使那些想要帮助这一国家的人不愿同情它了。”
