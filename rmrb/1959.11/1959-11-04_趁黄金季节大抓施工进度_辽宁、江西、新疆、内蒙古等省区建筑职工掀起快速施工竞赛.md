　　Seizing the Golden Season to Vigorously Advance Construction Progress
　　Liaoning, Jiangxi, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Other Provinces and Regions Construction Workers Launch Rapid Construction Competition

　　(By our staff reporter) The 360,000 workers on the basic construction front in Liaoning Province are seizing the current "golden" season for construction and launching a competition upsurge centered on industrial basic construction and based on technical performance competitions.

　　This year, basic construction in Liaoning Province is flourishing, and newly built and expanded projects are being put into production one after another, with a very good situation. So far, the province has completed 900 projects, including 25 above the quota limit. After these projects are put into production, they will greatly improve Liaoning Province's industrial production capacity and technical level.

　　In order to complete this year's construction tasks in a faster, better, and more economical way, after entering the fourth quarter, the broad masses of workers put forward the resounding slogans of "hurry up at the beginning, don't lag behind," "seize the golden season, ensure key points, and vigorously grasp the final stages." The construction speed has been greatly accelerated. After the Third and Fourth Engineering Companies of Shenyang City carried out technical performance competitions in major types of work, the production efficiency generally increased by two to four times, solving the labor shortage in October, and increasing the monthly plan by 10% to 25% on the original basis.

　　(By our staff reporter) After the basic construction front of Jiangxi Province opposed right-leaning tendencies, boosted morale, and vigorously carried out the movement to increase production and practice economy, an excellent situation of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results has emerged. By mid-October, more than 200 construction projects in the province had been completed in whole or in large part (including more than a dozen large-scale projects above the quota limit) and put into production. In addition, more than 100 construction projects are currently under intense construction.

　　Opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and vigorously carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy have made the basic construction situation in Jiangxi Province better month by month. In August, the amount of basic construction investment completed in the province increased by 34% compared with July, and in September it increased by 35.5% compared with August. There has also been a large increase in October. The cost of construction and installation projects in the province decreased by more than 140,000 yuan in August compared with July, and by more than 300,000 yuan in September. The installation cost in October also decreased.

　　At present, the basic construction workers in the province are not stopping to rest on their laurels, but are pressing ahead victoriously. All workers are working hard to complete this year's basic construction plan ahead of schedule.

　　(By our staff reporter) Tens of thousands of workers on the basic construction front in Xinjiang are comprehensively accelerating the construction and installation speed of dozens of key projects.

　　This year, the amount of construction and installation work in the autonomous region in the fourth quarter will increase by nearly double the average completion volume of the previous three quarters. Because the construction and installation workers in the autonomous region have adhered to the construction policy of taking steel as the key link, comprehensively advancing, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, by the end of September, these projects have completed more than two-thirds. The newly added pig iron production capacity has reached more than 200,000 tons, and the steelmaking capacity has reached 130,000 tons, making the autonomous region's steel production capacity several times higher than last year. Other projects such as the Karamay Oil Refinery with an annual processing capacity of 150,000 tons, and the Kashgar Hydropower Station have been put into production ahead of schedule.

　　Now, all construction units in the autonomous region are particularly grasping the construction and installation work of the 35 key projects arranged in the fourth quarter.

　　(By our staff reporter) This year's basic construction in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has presented an unprecedentedly prosperous scene.

　　Baogang, the third iron and steel base of the motherland, has completed key projects such as the No. 1 giant blast furnace, the 20-ton open hearth furnace, the 10-ton electric furnace, and the No. 3 and No. 4 large coke ovens this year thanks to the hard work of tens of thousands of workers. Of the 121 key projects built locally in Inner Mongolia this year, 30 have been fully or partially delivered for production and use.

　　Now, more than 190,000 construction workers active throughout Inner Mongolia are working with great enthusiasm, taking effective measures, vigorously grasping construction management, vigorously carrying out rapid construction, striving to complete the annual construction tasks of various national and local key construction projects ahead of schedule, and striving to make preparations for construction in the first quarter of next year.

    趁黄金季节大抓施工进度
    辽宁、江西、新疆、内蒙古等省区建筑职工掀起快速施工竞赛
    本报讯　辽宁省基本建设战线上三十六万职工，正在抓紧当前施工的“黄金”季节，掀起一个以工业基本建设为中心，以技术表演赛为基本形式的竞赛高潮。
    今年辽宁省基本建设欣欣向荣，新建和扩建的工程陆续投入生产，形势十分良好。到目前为止，全省已经完成九百项工程，其中限额以上的有二十五项。这些工程投入生产以后，将使辽宁省的工业生产能力和技术水平大大提高一步。
    为了多快好省地完成今年建设任务，进入第四季度后，广大职工提出了“赶前不赶后”、“趁黄金季节，确保重点，狠抓收尾”的响亮口号，施工速度大大加快。沈阳市第三、四工程公司在主要工种中开展技术表演赛后，生产效率普遍提高两倍到四倍，解决了10月份劳动力不足的困难，使月计划在原来的基础上又提高了10％到25％。
    本报讯　江西省基本建设战线经过反右倾、鼓干劲，大搞增产节约运动，出现了多快好省的大好形势。到10月中旬，全省已有二百多个建设工程全部或大部分建成（其中有十多个限额以上的大型工程），并且投入了生产。此外，还有一百多个建设工程目前正在紧张施工。
    反右倾，鼓干劲，大搞增产节约运动，使江西省基本建设状况一月比一月好。8月份全省完成的基建投资额比7月份增长了34％，9月份又比8月份提高35.5％，10月份也有很大增长。全省建筑安装工程成本，8月份比7月份节约十四万余元，9月份又节约了三十余万元，10月份的安装成本又有下降。
    目前，全省基建职工正在马不停蹄，乘胜前进，全体职工正在为提前完成今年基建计划而努力。
    本报讯　新疆基本建设战线上数万名职工正在全面加快几十项重点工程的建筑安装速度。
    今年，自治区在第四季度的建筑安装工作量，比前三个季度平均完成量增加将近一倍。由于自治区建筑安装职工坚持了以钢为纲，全面跃进和多快好省的建筑方针，到9月底，这些工程已经完成了三分之二以上，新增加的生铁生产能力达到二十万吨以上，炼钢能力达到十三万吨，使自治区钢铁生产能力比去年增加了好几倍，其他像年处理十五万吨的克拉玛依炼油厂、喀什水电站等已纷纷提前投入生产。
    现在，自治区各个建筑单位特别抓紧第四季度安排的三十五项重点工程的施工和安装工作。
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区今年的基本建设，出现了空前繁荣的景象。
