Short Commentary

    With the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the volume of freight transport in the fourth quarter of this year has grown unprecedentedly. Whether transportation capacity can adapt to the needs of transportation volume is a key issue related to whether the fourth-quarter national economic plan can be overfulfilled ahead of schedule and whether the first quarter of next year can continue to leap forward.

    How to solve the contradiction between transportation capacity and transportation volume? There are two ways: One is to rapidly build new railways, highways, waterways, and air routes, and increase more transportation equipment and vehicles; the other is to fully utilize the potential of existing transportation equipment, extensively carry out technological revolution, strengthen transportation collaboration, and improve transportation efficiency. We are actively increasing transportation capacity from these two aspects. However, from the current needs, the latter method is more urgent than the former. Because it costs less and yields faster results, it can have an immediate effect on easing the current contradiction between transportation capacity and transportation volume.

    The transportation sector has made significant achievements in tapping the potential of existing equipment during last year's Great Leap Forward and this year's continued leap forward. Among them, the well-known ones include "piggyback transportation" using empty return vehicles and the gaps in heavy vehicles to load goods; "high platforms and low cargo berths" which improve loading and unloading efficiency several times or even dozens of times; "fixed-route cyclical transportation" which strengthens planned dispatch and reduces empty mileage; and "route relocation" which opens up cargo spaces without the need for steel rails and sleepers. These experiences prove that in transportation, the ways to tap the potential of existing equipment are very broad. Recently, the Beijing East Suburb Station area has changed enterprise dedicated lines into shared lines, which is another example of tapping the potential of existing equipment. This area has not added a single rail or sleeper, but simply changed "dedicated" to "shared," which has shortened the operation time of vehicles stopping at the station by nearly half, doubled the speed of vehicle turnover, greatly increased the station's throughput capacity, and also saved a lot of freight, providing favorable conditions for the rational use of transport capacity. This is the correct path to go all out, aim high, and develop transportation in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    Tapping the potential of existing equipment involves a wide range and requires the relevant transportation departments and consigning departments to work together with one heart and mind, without distinction, and to give play to the spirit of communist collaboration. Only in this way can we more effectively improve transportation efficiency, ensure the continuous leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, and ensure the needs of people's lives. We hope that employees in the national transportation departments and consigning departments will strengthen collaboration, further give play to their subjective initiative, be brave in opening the treasure trove of transportation potential, and allow all equipment with potential to exert its maximum capacity in socialist construction.

    挖专用线的潜力
    在工农业生产继续跃进的形势下，今年第四季度的货物运输量空前增长。运输能力能否适应运输量的需要，是关系到第四季度国民经济计划能否提前超额完成和明年第一季度能否继续跃进的一个关键问题。
    如何解决运输能力和运输量不相适应的矛盾？办法有二：其一是迅速建设新的铁路、公路、航道和航空线，增加更多的运输设备和运输工具；其二是充分发挥现有运输设备的潜力，广泛开展技术革命，加强运输协作，提高运输效率。我们正是从这两方面来积极地增加运输能力。但是从目前的需要看来，后一种办法比前一种更有迫切意义。因为它花钱少、收效快，对于缓和当前运输能力和运输量之间不相适应的矛盾，能够立竿见影。 运输部门挖掘现有设备的潜力，在去年的大跃进和今年的继续跃进中，已经有了显著的成绩。其中有名的像利用回空车辆和重车空隙装货的“捎脚运输”；提高装卸效率几倍以至十几倍的“高站台低货位”；加强计划调度，减少空驶里程的“五定循环运输”；不需钢轨和枕木来增辟货位的“路线搬家”等等。这些经验证明，在运输方面，挖掘现有设备潜力的途径是十分广阔的。最近，北京东郊车站地区将企业专用线改为共用线，又是一个挖掘现有设备潜力的实例。这个地区没有增加一根钢轨一根枕木，只是将“专用”改为“共用”，就使车辆在车站停站的作业时间缩短将近一半，车辆周转的速度加快一倍，大大增加了车站的吞吐能力，而且还节省了大量运费，给合理使用运力提供了有利条件。这是鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地发展交通运输事业的正确道路。
    挖掘现有设备潜力，牵涉的范围很广，需要有关的运输部门和托运部门同心协力，不分彼此，发挥共产主义协作精神。只有这样，才能更有效地提高运输效率，保证工农业生产不断跃进，保证人民生活的需要。愿全国运输部门和托运部门的职工加强协作，进一步发挥主观能动性，勇于打开运输潜力的宝库，让所有有潜力的设备，都能在社会主义建设中，使出最大的能力吧。
