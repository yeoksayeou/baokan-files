Cure One Worm in Winter, Reap Ten Thousand Grains in Autumn
    Chen County Special District Mobilizes 600,000 People to Eradicate Overwintering Pests and Diseases
    Xinjiang Vigorously Prevents and Controls Winter Wheat Pests and Diseases, Henan Induces, Traps and Kills Large Numbers of Soil Locusts

    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the New Hunan Daily, the Chen County Special District, holding high the red flag of a pest-free special district, with water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation as the center after the basic completion of the "Three Autumns" campaign, also seized the "dormant period" of pests and diseases, mobilizing 600,000 people to carry out a campaign to eliminate overwintering pests and diseases. Now, in the entire district, from the large mountainous areas of Yizhang and Rugui to the hilly areas along the Lei River, all 3.66 million mu of rice fields have achieved bare rice stubble, bare weeds and miscellaneous grasses, and bare diseased seedlings and stalks. In addition, 930,000 mu of fields were "whitened" with lime, and winter puddles in 800,000 mu of rice fields were mixed with lime and tea bran to kill insects. Winter crops on 888,000 mu were also sprayed with pesticides for prevention and control. According to recent surveys and extrapolations from various places, the number of rice stem borer pupae eliminated is estimated to be over 200 billion. Combined with the "Three Bares," 87.42 million dan of fertilizer were also accumulated, averaging an increase of 17 dan of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land.

    This year, the Chen County Special District basically realized a pest-free special district, and crops basically did not suffer losses due to pests and diseases, ensuring a bumper harvest in agricultural production. The Chen County Party Committee believes that the reason for achieving this great victory in plant protection is that in the great leap forward of the winter of 1958, the people's communes throughout the district carried out a campaign to eliminate overwintering pests and diseases, implemented the "Three Bares" on 90% of the cultivated land, and winter crops were generally treated to kill insects. The Chen County Party Committee summarized this experience, analyzing that most of the district is mountainous, bordering Guangdong and Guangxi, with a mild climate and short frost and snow periods, resulting in a very low overwintering mortality rate for pests. According to surveys, generally 40%-50% of insect pupae survive the winter and reproduce each year. If the "dormant period" of pests is seized, and the characteristics of pests' gregariousness and weak crawling ability are grasped to capture and kill them, there are five major benefits: namely, saving labor, saving money, saving medicine, accumulating a large amount of fertilizer, and simultaneously controlling rice blast, achieving the effect of killing one to save a thousand, and achieving twice the result with half the effort. The entire district calculated that if more than 90% of overwintering pests are eliminated this winter, it is estimated that based on this year's prevention and control, next year will save 20 million workdays, 7 to 8 million jin of medicine, and 3 to 4 million yuan. Therefore, the Party Committee decided to seize the favorable opportunity and launch a campaign to eliminate overwintering pests and diseases, laying a good foundation for continued great leaps forward next year.

    In the winter pest control campaign, various places adhered to putting politics in command, and Party committees at all levels strengthened the leadership of pest control work. While grasping the "Three Autumns" work, the Chen County Party Committee arranged winter pest control work, and then combined with the major inspection of increasing production and practicing economy to conduct specific investigations into the living habits of overwintering pests. Comrade Chen Hongxin, the first secretary of the Chen County Party Committee, went deep into the fields of the Jinnan Brigade of the Chengguan Commune in Leiyang, dug up eleven rice stubbles, and found seventy-five stem borer pupae. He immediately issued a battle call to the people of the entire special district at a telephone conference: "Fight hard for seven days to completely eliminate overwintering pests and diseases!" Party secretaries at all levels personally took charge and personally went into battle, using the form of on-site meetings to make comparisons and calculations, and carry out large-scale debates in the fields. The Zhuchuan Commune in Anren County had a Baolian Brigade that had always believed that its pest control work was well done. Recently, they dug up eighteen rice stubbles, but found 164 overwintering stem borer pupae. They calculated the cost: if these stem borer pupae are not eliminated this year, they will develop into the second generation next year, totaling 650,000, which will destroy three mu of rice fields. This kind of inspection and calculation overcame complacency and complacency, and pest control work quickly unfolded.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi) The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is organizing the masses and using airplanes to eliminate winter wheat pests and diseases.

    Recently, wheat aphid, wheat stem fly, cutworm, wireworm, and wheat rust have occurred extensively in various parts of the autonomous region. The Kashi and Aksu special districts are more serious, with pest infestation areas reaching 600,000 mu. In order to ensure the vigorous growth of the 11 million mu of winter wheat that has emerged, the Kashi and Aksu special districts, which are more seriously affected by pests, began to use airplanes for large-scale prevention and control in mid-October. Nearly 300,000 mu have now been treated, with a kill rate of over 80%. Other places have also organized the masses and established and improved pest control professional teams to carry out ground prevention and control. Yili, Hami, Turpan and other places have organized manpower to use indigenous methods such as plant ash, lime sulfur mixture, 666, and walnut husks to make medicinal solutions for spraying. Baicheng County prepares nearly 20 tons of medicine every day, enough for one plane to spray for a day. The winter wheat that has been treated has been freed from the harm of pests and diseases, and there are basically no missing seedlings, and the prevention and control effect is good.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou) Soil locusts are harming some areas of Henan Province, and large-scale locust control movements have achieved remarkable results. According to statistics at the end of October, soil locusts occurred on more than 5.22 million mu of land in 64 counties (cities) across the province, and 96% of the area has now been treated. In addition to chemical control, more than 3.52 million jin of soil locusts have been captured and killed manually.

    Due to the prolonged drought this autumn, the area of soil locust occurrence is 1.27 times more than the most serious year after liberation (1957), which was 2.3 million mu. The density per square zhang is generally 30 to 50, and some areas have also experienced some migratory locusts. In order to eliminate locust plagues, people's communes in various places quickly mobilized, rushing to fight drought and plant wheat on the one hand, and carrying out mass locust control movements on the other. On October 13, the Nanyang Special District mobilized more than 590,000 people to rush to eliminate soil locusts in 1.34 million mu of wheat fields, accounting for 80.8% of the area where locust plagues occurred.

    At present, various places have entered the final stage of soil locust control. The broad masses of commune members, combined with checking seedlings and replanting, are sweeping up the remnants while rechecking, resolutely preventing soil locusts from harming wheat seedlings.

    冬治一条虫　秋收万粒谷
    郴县专区出动六十万人歼灭越冬病虫害
    新疆大力防治冬麦病虫害河南诱杀捕打大量土蝗
    本报讯　据新湖南报消息：郴县专区高举无病虫害专区红旗，在“三秋”战役基本结束时，以水利、积肥为中心，同时抓住病虫“休眠期”，出动六十万人，开展消灭越冬病虫害运动。现在全区从宜章、汝桂的大山区到耒水两岸的丘陵地，三百六十六万亩稻田，已全部作到了禾蔸光，游草、杂草光，病苗、病秆光；还有九十三万亩田用石灰搞了“白化”，八十万亩稻田的冬氹掺打了石灰和茶枯杀虫，对八十八万八千亩冬种作物还打了一次农药进行防治。据最近各地调查推算，光消灭稻田螟蛹约在二千亿条以上。结合“三光”还积制了肥料八千七百四十二万担，按耕地面积每亩平均增加肥料十七担。
    郴县专区今年基本实现了无病虫害专区，农作物基本上没有因病虫害遭受损失，保证了农业生产的特大丰收。中共郴县地委认为在植物保护上取得这个伟大胜利的原因，是在大跃进的1958年冬季全区人民公社开展了消灭越冬病虫害运动，在90％的耕地上搞了“三光”，冬种作物普遍进行了杀虫。郴县地委总结了这方面的经验，分析全区多系山区，与两广接界，气候温和，霜雪期短，害虫的越冬死亡率很低，据调查每年冬季一般都有40％—50％的虫蛹越过冬天，进行繁殖。如果抓住害虫“休眠期”，掌握害虫性喜群居、蠕动能力很弱的特点进行捕杀，则有五大好处：即能省工、省钱、省药、能积制大量肥料、能兼治稻瘟病，收到灭一少千、事半功倍的效果。全区计算，今年冬季如果把越冬病虫消灭90％以上，预计在今年防治的基础上，明年将可省工二千万个、省药剂七百到八百万斤、省钱三百到四百万元。因此地委决定抓住有利时机，开展消灭越冬病虫害运动，为明年的继续大跃进打好基础。
    在冬季治虫运动中，各地坚持了政治挂帅，各级党委加强了治虫工作的领导。郴县地委在抓“三秋”工作的同时即布置了冬季治虫工作，随后又结合增产节约大检查对越冬虫害的生活习性进行了具体调查。地委第一书记陈洪新同志在耒阳城关公社金南大队深入田间，挖了十一个禾蔸，发现有七十五个螟蛹，当即在电话会议上向全专区人民发出了“苦战七天，彻底消灭越冬病虫害”的战斗号令。各级党委书记亲自挂帅，亲自上阵，以现场会的形式，进行对比算账，开展田间大鸣、大放、大辩论。安仁县珠泉公社有一个一向认为治虫工作搞得不错的宝莲大队，最近挖出十八个禾蔸，却发现有越冬螟蛹一百六十四条。他们算了一笔账：如果今年不把这些螟蛹消灭，到明年发展到第二代，就有六十五万条，将要毁灭三亩稻田，这样检查、算账，克服了麻痹自满情绪，治虫工作迅速开展。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐讯　新疆维吾尔自治区正在组织群众和使用飞机，消灭冬麦病虫害。
    自治区各地最近普遍发生麦蚜、麦秆蝇、地老虎、金针虫和麦锈病等冬麦病虫害，其中喀什、阿克苏两专区比较严重，虫害面积达六十万亩。为了确保已经出苗的一千一百万亩冬麦生长茁壮，从10月中旬开始，虫害较严重的喀什、阿克苏两专区就使用飞机进行大面积防治，现在已防治近三十万亩，杀伤效果达80％以上。其他各地也纷纷组织群众，建立与健全治虫专业队，进行地面防治。伊犁、哈密、吐鲁番等地组织人力，利用草木灰、石灰硫黄合剂、六六六和核桃皮等土法制成药水喷洒。拜城县每天配制药物近二十吨，足够一架飞机一天喷用。被防治的冬小麦已经脱离了病虫危害，基本上没有缺苗，防治的效果良好。
    据新华社郑州讯　河南省部分地区土蝗为害，各地大规模灭蝗运动已取得显著成绩。据10月底统计，全省有六十四个县（市）五百二十二万多亩土地发生土蝗，现在已有96％的面积进行过防治。除药杀外，人工捕打土蝗三百五十二万多斤。
    由于今年秋季长期干旱，土蝗发生面积较解放后最严重的一年（1957年）的二百三十万亩还多一点二七倍，一般每方丈密度都在三十至五十头，有的地区还发生部分飞蝗。为消灭蝗害，各地人民公社迅速动员起来，一面突击抗旱种麦，一面开展群众性的灭蝗运动。南阳专区在10月13日出动五十九万多人，突击消灭了一百三十四万亩麦田里的土蝗，占蝗害发生面积的80.8％。
    目前，各地已进入防治土蝗的扫残阶段，广大社员结合查苗补种，边扫残边复查，坚决不让土蝗危害麦苗。
