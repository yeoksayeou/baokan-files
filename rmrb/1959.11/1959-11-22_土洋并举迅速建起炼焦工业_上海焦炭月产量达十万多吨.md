This newspaper reports from Shanghai on the 21st: The Party Central Committee's "walking on two legs" policy, such as "simultaneously employing indigenous and foreign methods," has achieved a brilliant victory on Shanghai's coking front.

In the past, Shanghai had no coking industry, and coke supply relied on other regions. Currently, Shanghai's monthly coke production exceeds 100,000 tons, powerfully supporting the development of Shanghai's steel and casting industries.

Shanghai's coking industry was built on the foundation laid during the Great Leap Forward last year and has vigorously developed during this year's continued leap forward. Starting from more than two thousand small indigenous coke ovens, it has gradually developed into a modern coking plant with an annual output of 450,000 tons of coke, more than thirty simple coke ovens using foreign methods, and more than nine hundred large indigenous coke ovens. In indigenous coking, workers use manual labor and simple coal washing machines to reduce the sulfur content in the coal, control the combustion temperature and build firebrick walls to increase the coking rate, and compact the coal layers layer by layer with stones, resulting in large and solid coke.

After the situation of the Great Leap Forward arrived last year, the demand for coke from the steel, machinery, and electrical industries increased day by day. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to build a modern coking plant with an annual output of 450,000 tons of coke in the Wujing area; at the same time, it launched a mass indigenous coking movement in industries with the right conditions, producing large quantities of indigenous coke to provide more coke for the development of the steel, machinery, and electrical industries. Due to the implementation of the working method of vigorously carrying out mass movements in coke production, more than two thousand small indigenous coke ovens were rapidly built in less than three months last year, producing nearly 100,000 tons of indigenous coke. Since the beginning of this year, the more than two thousand small coke ovens have been consolidated and merged into more than nine hundred large indigenous coke ovens with some mechanical equipment, led separately by more than fifty units, strengthening management, and rapidly increasing the output and quality of indigenous coke. The Municipal Committee also grasped the construction of factory buildings and equipment manufacturing for the Wujing Coking Plant and simple coke ovens, so that the coking industry, under the guidance of the policy of "simultaneously employing indigenous and foreign methods" and "combining large, medium, and small," has advanced by leaps and bounds, and coke production has increased from a monthly output of 30,000 to 40,000 tons at the beginning of the year to more than 100,000 tons in October.

    土洋并举迅速建起炼焦工业  上海焦炭月产量达十万多吨
    本报上海21日电　党中央提出的“土洋并举”等“两条腿走路”的方针，在上海炼焦战线上获得了辉煌的胜利。
    过去，上海从来没有过炼焦工业，焦炭供应要依靠外地。目前上海焦炭月产量在十万吨以上，有力地支援了上海钢铁和铸造工业的发展。
    上海的炼焦工业是在去年大跃进中打下基础，今年继续跃进中蓬勃发展起来的。从二千多只小土焦窑开始，逐步建设发展成拥有一座年产四十五万吨焦炭的现代化炼焦厂，三十多座洋法生产的简易炼焦炉和九百多座大型土炼焦窑。在土法炼焦中，工人们用人工和简易洗煤机来降低煤里的含硫量，用控制燃烧温度和砌耐火砖围墙来提高成焦率，用石块把煤层一层层夯结实，结果烧出了又大又结实的焦炭。
    去年大跃进的形势到来以后，钢铁、机电等工业部门焦炭需要量一天比一天增加。中共上海市委决定在吴泾地区建设一座年产焦四十五万吨的现代化炼焦厂；同时，在有条件的行业中开展一个群众性的土法炼焦运动，大炼土焦，为钢铁、机电工业的发展提供更多焦炭。由于在炼焦生产上贯彻了大搞群众运动的工作方法，去年在不到三个月时间内，就迅速建起了二千多只小型土焦窑，炼出了近十万吨的土焦。今年以来，二千多只小焦窑经过整顿，合并成为九百多座有部分机械设备的大型土焦窑，由五十多个单位分别领导，加强管理，迅速地提高了土焦的产量、质量。市委还抓紧了吴泾炼焦厂和简易炼焦炉的厂房建筑和设备制造，使炼焦工业在“土洋并举”和“大中小相结合”的方针指导下，大踏步地前进，焦炭的产量从年初月产三、四万吨，增长到10月份的十万多吨。
