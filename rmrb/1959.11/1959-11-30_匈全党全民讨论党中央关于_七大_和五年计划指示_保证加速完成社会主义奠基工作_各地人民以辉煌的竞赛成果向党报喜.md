Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 29th: The entire membership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the working people of the whole country have enthusiastically discussed the instructions of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party regarding the Seventh Congress and the Second Five-Year Plan (1961-1965).

In the two months since the publication of these two instructions of the Party Central Committee, tens of thousands of party members and non-party masses in party organizations, factories, enterprises and rural areas at all levels throughout the country have earnestly and actively participated in various forms of discussion. During the discussions, they reviewed the work done in economic and cultural construction in the past period, and expressed their support for the policies implemented by the Party in the past three years. They have pledged to rapidly implement the plans for accelerating socialist construction formulated by the Party, and have put forward many suggestions based on the spirit of the two instructions and the specific conditions of their own departments. The Party organization attaches great importance to these opinions from the masses and has established a committee to specifically handle these suggestions.

The situation of discussions in various places shows that the unity of the Party and the relationship between the Party and the masses have been further strengthened, and the Party's prestige among the masses has also been greatly enhanced. Therefore, strengthening the Party's leadership and maintaining the purity of Marxism-Leninism have become issues of universal concern when people discuss the two instructions. In many enterprises, people have requested the Party organization to play a greater role in economic leadership. Some people in cultural and artistic circles have also expressed their determination to improve their political and ideological level in order to assist the Party in strengthening the communist education of the people.

The Party's instructions propose to complete the foundation-laying work of socialism and accelerate socialist construction in the next few years. This magnificent goal has greatly inspired the working people's confidence and enthusiasm for building socialism. Many factories, enterprises, and cooperatives have summed up their past production experience and studied the development plans of their departments according to the Party Central Committee's instructions on the Second Five-Year Plan. For example, after discussing the Party Central Committee's instructions on the Five-Year Plan, the workers in the machine tool manufacturing sector decided that the production of metal cutting machine tools should increase by 526% in 1965 compared with 1958, and focus on the production of automated machine tools. Employees of the Chemical Industry Machine and Heating Equipment Manufacturing Plant assured that this year's products will not only meet domestic needs, but also be available for export; by 1965, the production of chemical industry machines will increase by 60%. Farmers in various places have also expressed that, according to the Party's instructions, they will strengthen deep plowing and careful cultivation in the future, and actively increase the unit yield of crops.

Responding to the Party's call to accelerate socialist construction, the working people of the whole country are earnestly exploring production potential and trying to rapidly increase labor productivity. Many people have suggested that local funds should be fully utilized, and the utilization rate of workshop equipment and machines should be maximized, without relying on national investment everywhere.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 29th: The labor competition launched by the Hungarian working people in March this year to welcome the Seventh Congress of the Socialist Workers' Party has achieved remarkable achievements so far. Recently, factories, mines, and rural areas in various places have reported good news to the Party with brilliant achievements.

The first to report success to the Party Central Committee in the heated competition were the employees of the mining, electricity, and chemical industry departments. They had already completed the targets of the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960) a year ahead of schedule in October, and entered 1961 at full speed.

The pledge made by the employees of the metallurgy and machinery manufacturing departments to present gifts to the Party Congress was: to overfulfill this year's production plan by 1 billion forints and to overfulfill the export product plan by 200 million forints. This gift pledge has already been greatly overfulfilled in October.

The employees of the light industry and food industry departments also completed their gift pledges at the end of October.

The battle for agricultural harvests launched by the vast rural areas to welcome the Party Congress has also achieved great success. This year, both bread grain and feed grain production increased by 30% compared with last year, and the average yield of wheat per hold (approximately 0.57 mu) increased by 22.5% compared with the average level of 1956-1958, corn by 22.1%, and sugar beet by 18.2%.

The Hungarian working people have displayed unparalleled wisdom in the competition to welcome the Party Congress. In the first half of this year alone, they put forward 106,000 technical innovation proposals and more than 500 significant inventions. Half of them have been adopted, which has greatly improved labor productivity, promoted the increase in production, and reduced production costs. At present, many industrial and mining enterprises are further exploring potential and striving to achieve greater victories in production by the end of the year.

    匈全党全民讨论党中央关于“七大”和五年计划指示
    保证加速完成社会主义奠基工作
    各地人民以辉煌的竞赛成果向党报喜
    据新华社布达佩斯29日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党全体党员和全国劳动人民热烈讨论了社会主义工人党中央委员会关于第七次代表大会和第二个五年计划（1961—1965年）的指示。
    在党中央的这两个指示公布后，两个月来全国各级党组织、工厂企业和农村的成千上万的党员和非党员群众都认真积极地参加了各种形式的讨论。他们在讨论中回顾了过去一个时期在经济和文化建设方面的工作，并表示拥护党在最近三年来所执行的政策。他们纷纷保证要使党所制定的加速社会主义建设的计划得到迅速的实现，并根据两个指示的精神和自己部门的具体情况提出了许多建议。党组织对这些来自群众的意见非常重视，成立了专门处理这些建议的委员会。
    各地讨论的情况表明，党的团结和党群关系更加加强了，党在群众中的威信也大大提高了。因此，加强党的领导和维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁性就成了人们在讨论两个指示时普遍注意的问题。在许多企业中都有人要求党组织对经济领导工作发挥更大作用。有些文化艺术界人士也表示决心提高自己的政治思想水平，以便协助党加强对人民的共产主义教育。
    党的指示提出要在最近几年内完成社会主义奠基工作，加速社会主义建设。这个宏伟目标大大地鼓舞了劳动人民建设社会主义的信心和生产热情。许多工厂企业和合作社都总结了过去的生产经验，根据党中央关于第二个五年计划的指示研究了本部门的发展计划。如机床制造部门的工人们在讨论党中央关于五年计划的指示后，决定要使金属加工机床的生产在1965年比1958年增长526％，并且着重生产自动化机床。化学工业机器和暖气设备制造厂的职工保证今年的产品不但能满足本国需要，还能供应出口；到1965年将使化学工业机器的生产增长60％。各地农民也表示要根据党的指示在今后加强深耕细作，积极提高农作物的单位面积产量。
    全国劳动人民响应党加速社会主义建设的号召，正在认真地发掘生产潜力，设法快速提高劳动生产率。许多人提出应该充分利用地方资金，尽量提高车间设备和机器的利用率，不能处处依靠国家投资。
    新华社布达佩斯29日电　匈牙利劳动人民在今年3月间为迎接社会主义工人党第七次代表大会而开展的劳动竞赛，到现在为止已经取得了卓著的成就。最近以来，各地的工厂、矿山、农村纷纷以辉煌战果向党报喜。
    在热火朝天的竞赛中首先向党中央报捷的是矿业、电力和化学工业部门的职工。他们还在10月份就已经提前一年完成了三年计划（1958—1960年）的指标，快马加鞭进入了1961年。
    冶金和机器制造业部门的职工提出的向党代会献礼的保证是：超额十亿福林完成今年生产计划和超额两亿福林完成出口产品计划。这个献礼保证已经在10月份大大地超额实现了。
    轻工业和食品工业部门的职工也在10月末完成了献礼保证。
    广大农村为迎接党代表大会而展开的争取农业丰收的战斗，也获得了巨大的成就。今年，面包谷物和饲料用谷物都比去年增产了30％，每霍尔特（约合0.57市亩）小麦的平均产量比1956—1958年的平均水平提高了22.5％，玉米－22.1％，甜菜－18.2％。
    匈牙利劳动人民在迎接党代会的竞赛中发挥了无比的智慧，仅仅在今年上半年就提出了十万六千项技术革新建议和五百多件有重大意义的发明创造。其中有一半已被采用，从而大大地提高了劳动生产率，促进了生产的提高和生产成本的降低。目前，许多工矿企业正在进一步发掘潜力，争取到年底在生产上取得更大的胜利。
