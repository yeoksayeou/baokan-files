The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Communist Youth League Central Committee jointly issued a notice on carrying out “One-Year Entry Summary” activities among apprentices.

　　The notice pointed out that how to better organize apprentices' three years of learning is a question worth serious study. Taiyuan City treats the first year of entry as a stage of apprentice learning, mobilizing them to consciously conduct an inspection and summary, which is a practice worth promoting. If the effect is good, in the future, we can consider forming this kind of mass learning summary into a system, conducting it every six months, or at least once a year. Divide the three years into several stages, using mass self-education methods to summarize experience, overcome shortcomings, clarify thinking, and improve awareness. This is very beneficial. The notice requires all regions to follow Taiyuan City's approach, and before the end of the year, under the unified leadership of the local party committee, in conjunction with the current increase production and practice economy campaign, use spare time to carry out such activities.

　　The notice said: At present, mobilizing apprentices to summarize one year of learning, exchange learning experiences, and help them further solve the problem of who they are studying for and who they are working for, is a beneficial measure to mobilize the vast number of apprentices to more actively participate in the increase production and practice economy campaign. As long as the arrangements are appropriate, and it is carried out with leadership and planning, it will definitely be able to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the vast number of apprentices and contribute to the further development of the increase production and practice economy campaign.

　　The notice requires that all regions pay attention to the following when carrying out this activity: (1) The learning summary activity is a mass self-education activity, and apprentices should be enlightened to consciously conduct inspection and summary, and improve understanding through mutual assistance. (2) The development of learning summary activities should be closely combined with the current production movement, and the methods and steps should be adapted to local conditions; it should be combined with the "three helps and five goods" activities being carried out in various places, so that the "three helps and five goods" activities can be carried out more extensively and effectively. (3) In this activity, we must focus on publicizing the model deeds of a group of outstanding apprentices, and establish pacesetters for the vast number of apprentices to learn from and catch up with. At the same time, we must also publicize and commend a group of veteran workers who have made outstanding achievements in helping and educating apprentices. Through their advanced examples and personal experiences, drive and educate the vast number of apprentices. (4) In this activity, trade unions and youth league organizations should also pay attention to summarizing the experience of conducting apprentice work, and improve the work of training and educating apprentices.

　　(By Our Newspaper) Recently, under the instructions of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League launched a summary education activity for new workers one year after entering the factory throughout the city. This activity fully mobilized the positive factors of apprentices, enabling more than 100,000 new workers in the city to play a greater role in the campaign to fight the fourth quarter and enter 1960 at high speed, and laid a solid foundation for continued leaps forward next year. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League also held an on-site meeting at the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant to summarize and promote the plant's work experience.

　　Under the glorious illumination of the general line, under the kind teachings of the Party and the Youth League, and the diligent training of master workers, the vast majority of the more than 100,000 new workers in Taiyuan City, in the year of the Great Leap Forward, loved labor, loved the collective, and loved their jobs, respected their masters, studied diligently and practiced hard, and worked hard. At present, about 80% of the new workers in the city are able to operate independently on general products; about 40% have been rated as excellent apprentices; about 15% have been rated as advanced producers; and many have already entered 1960.

　　The one-year summary education for new workers is a kind of mass self-education. Most of the units currently carrying out this activity are proceeding in three stages. The first stage is the self-education stage. The main task is to provide new workers with some more enlightening topics, and help new workers summarize their achievements in the first year of entering the factory through reminiscence forums, reporting to the Party and master workers, etc. The second stage is the systematic education stage. Based on the general situation learned in the first stage, and based on the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, conduct systematic political education for new workers, and systematically improve on the basis of the summary. The third stage is the summary education stage. Organize new workers to write summaries, formulate plans, hold new worker conferences or representative meetings, commend advanced workers, recruit a group of new workers into the Youth League, and organize new workers to further carry out competitions. The entire activity focuses on positive education, enlightenment guidance, cultivation of typical examples, and assistance in improvement. The forms of summary education are lively and diverse. There are reminiscences, forums, visits, big-character posters, one-year achievement exhibitions, harvest meetings, report meetings to the Party and master workers, etc., as much as possible to suit the characteristics of new workers.

　　Units that started this activity earlier have already achieved good results. The Gauge and Cutter Factory reported: Since the education, the awareness of new workers has been improved, their enthusiasm has been greater, their study has been more active, the relationship between masters and apprentices has been closer than in the past, and they have completed their tasks more than ever.

    全国总工会共青团中央联合发出通知
    进行学习总结加强徒工教育
    太原市开展徒工入厂一周年总结活动收到很大效果
    本报讯：全国总工会和共青团中央发出关于在徒工中普遍开展“入厂一年学习总结”活动的通知。
    通知指出，如何更好地组织徒工三年的学习，这是一个值得认真研究的问题。太原市把入厂一年作为徒工学习的一个阶段，发动他们自觉地进行一次检查和总结，这是一种值得推广的作法。如果效果良好，今后就可以考虑将这种群众性的学习总结形成一种制度，每半年、至少每年进行一次。把三年分作几段，用群众自我教育的方法，总结经验，克服缺点，澄清思想，提高觉悟。这样作很有好处。通知要求各地，仿照太原市的作法，在年底以前，在当地党委的统一领导下，结合着当前的增产节约运动，利用业余时间，都来开展一次这样的活动。
    通知中说：在当前，发动徒工进行一年学习的总结，交流学习经验，帮助他们进一步解决为谁学习、为谁劳动的问题，这是发动广大徒工更加积极地参加增产节约运动的一个有益措施。只要安排得当，有领导有计划地去进行，就一定能够充分调动广大徒工的积极性，有助于增产节约运动的进一步发展。
    通知要求各地在开展这一活动时注意：（一）学习总结活动，是一个群众性的自我教育活动，应当启发徒工自觉地进行检查和总结，经过相互帮助、提高认识。（二）要把开展学习总结活动，同当前生产运动紧密地结合起来，方法和步骤要因地制宜；同各地正在开展的“三帮五好”活动结合起来，使“三帮五好”活动开展得更广泛更有成效。（三）在这一活动中，要集中的宣传一批优秀徒工的模范事迹，树立起为广大徒工学习和追赶的标兵。同时，也要宣传和表扬一批在帮助和教育徒工中有出色成绩的老工人。通过他们的先进事例和切身体验，去带动和教育广大徒工。（四）在这一活动中，工会和团组织还要注意总结进行徒工工作的经验，把培养和教育徒工的工作提高一步。
    本报讯　最近以来，共青团太原市委在中共太原市委的指示下，在全市范围开展了新工人入厂一周年总结教育活动。这项活动充分调动了徒工的积极因素，使全市十余万新工人在大战第四季度、高速度跨进1960年的运动中发挥了更大的作用，并为明年继续跃进打下了坚实的基础。共青团太原市委并在太原机车车辆厂召开了现场会，总结和推广了这个工厂的工作经验。
    太原市十余万新工人，在总路线光辉照耀下，在党、团亲切教导和老师傅的辛勤培养下，在大跃进的一年里，绝大多数热爱劳动，热爱集体，热爱岗位工作，作到了尊敬师傅，勤学苦练，刻苦钻研。目前全市约有80％以上新工人在一般产品上能够独立操作；有40％左右的人被评为优秀徒工；有15％左右被评为先进生产者；许多人已跨进了1960年。
    新工人入厂一周年总结教育是一种群众性的自我教育。目前进行这一活动的大部分单位是分三个阶段进行。第一阶段是自我教育阶段。主要是给新工人提出一些启发性较强的题目，通过回忆座谈，向党向老师傅汇报等形式，帮助新工人总结入厂一年来的成绩。第二阶段，系统教育阶段，根据第一阶段了解到的带有普遍性的情况，根据八中全会精神，对新工人进行系统的政治教育，在总结的基础上，系统提高。第三阶段，总结教育阶段，组织新工人写总结，制定计划，开新工人大会或代表会议，表彰先进，吸收一批新工人入团，组织新工人进一步开展竞赛。整个活动以正面教育为主，启发引导，培养典型，帮助提高。总结教育的形式活泼多样。有回忆、座谈、参观、大字报、一年成绩展览会，丰收会，向党向老师傅汇报会等，尽量适合新工人的特点。
  开展这一活动较早的单位，目前都已收到很好的效果，量具刃具厂反映：进行教育以来，新工人的觉悟提高了，干劲更大了，学习较先积极了，师徒关系比过去更密切了，完成任务超额更多了。
