The good news of the completion of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant is like a spring thunder, shaking the hearts of 500 million farmers. In just four years, people have seen such tremendous changes, who wouldn't be excited?

On the factory grounds, larger than the old city of Luoyang, magnificent building complexes stretch as far as the eye can see. Special railway lines transport materials with a wailing whistle, and the 80-meter-high chimney of the thermal power plant emits clouds of smoke. In the factory area, green trees shade red buildings, and the central avenue's street gardens and both sides of the road are filled with colorful flowerbeds and dense shrubs...

**One Tractor Every Nineteen Minutes**

In this factory, each workshop, each department, and each section is as complete as a human body, closely linked and coordinated. The highly mechanized production process makes labor here exceptionally easy. In the steel casting workshop, sand milling, mixing, sieving, molding, pouring, shakeout, and cleaning are all operated by machinery. Therefore, there are few workers on site, but various conveyor belts are intertwined like rings. Rows of sandboxes move slowly on the rollers according to the speed of pouring, until the castings cool down and finally fall onto the underground conveyor belt, which sends them to the relevant workshops for use, all without manual handling.

The factory's 222 assembly lines, like streams of different sizes, eventually converge to the main assembly line. They all organize their production according to the overall pace of producing one tractor every 19 minutes. On the main assembly line, engines, radiators, and chassis are assembled mechanically within the designed seconds. After each body is assembled, the stamping workshop across the road promptly sends the tractor cab shell via the open-air conveyor belt... Thus, one after another, large, bright red and rose-colored tractors put on beautiful coats in the paint shop, are fitted with tracks, and then run out of the factory with a rumbling sound.

**Arming Our Heroes**

In the workshops, we saw countless large and precise machine tools. In addition to those provided by the Soviet Union, there are also machine tools manufactured in Shanghai, Dalian, Shenyang, Jinan, and other places. However, a large portion of the mechanized equipment, such as high-frequency quenching machines, gantry milling machines, muffle furnaces, cupola furnaces, converters, and electric furnaces, were manufactured by the "First Tractor Manufacturing Plant" itself. According to statistics, 90% of the factory's equipment is domestically manufactured, of which 20% of the standard equipment and more than 90% of the non-standard equipment were manufactured by the factory's workers themselves, arming themselves.

After the factory Party committee issued a call to accelerate the arming of the first line of tractor production—the steel casting and iron casting workshops—more than 30 people in the riveting and welding group worked continuously for ten days and completed all the conveyor belts urgently needed by the steel casting workshop, which would normally take half a year. More than 2,000 steel plates, each seven or eight millimeters thick and more than one meter wide, had to have their edges bent by hand. They swung hammers weighing 10 to 20 kilograms, hammering the steel plates non-stop. Blisters appeared on their palms, and sweat soaked their cotton-padded coats, but no one left the front line. Gu Shenglin added skill to hard work, developed a die, and increased processing efficiency by 40 times. There are such heroic deeds on every production line of the tractor factory.

**Heart to Heart with Farmer Brothers**

The workers here deeply care about every change in the countryside, and the farmers' desire for mechanization deeply touches their hearts. This is not only because they shoulder the mission of supporting agricultural mechanization, but also because most of them come from the countryside. When they came to the factory, their fathers, brothers, uncles, neighbors told them: "We hope you can make tractors quickly! We need tractors the most!" What a tremendous motivation this is!

We remember that when the People's Communes were established in the countryside last year, 40% of the factory's equipment had not yet arrived. People built the unfinished factory buildings while working day and night to produce the "Dongfanghong" tractor before "August 1st." Without stamping equipment in the foundry shop, people hammered steel plates by hand to make the cab shell. Without machine tools for processing large parts, they overcame difficulties by chipping away at them bit by bit. At this time, Zhu Guangfu, a worker in the engine workshop, returned to his hometown in Shanghai during his vacation. His mother asked when they met: "Child! Our place has already been communized, will your tractors come out soon?" This young man, who made the steering pipe "joint" for the engine, worked hard after returning to the factory. He said to people: "If I don't work hard, I will be letting down the Communist Party! And I will be letting down my mother!" In the past, he made 200 joints a day, but now he completes 900 a day. He improved several tools and increased the efficiency of the eight parts he was responsible for processing on the tractor engine by three to four times.

**A New Generation**

The first batch of tractors in the motherland was born. Along with them, the first generation of tractor manufacturing workers in the motherland also grew up. Perhaps it is hard to imagine how these children, who just left school a year or two ago, or the farmers who just put down their hoes, could quickly reach the peak of modern technology. Let's take an example. Manufacturing the breathing pipe—injector nozzle—on the fuel pump is a very precise job. The tolerance of each part is not allowed to exceed one-seventieth of a hair's breadth, but the parts of this injector nozzle are processed by a group of very young girls. One is the seat surface group led by 21-year-old Yang Huifen, and the other is the oil needle group led by 19-year-old Guo Qiaofeng. Because they have carefully learned and mastered the technology under the care of the Party and with the help of Soviet experts, the oil needles, oil needle bodies, check valves, check valve seats, etc. they are responsible for processing have reached and exceeded the Soviet design level in terms of quality and output. Examples like Yang Huifen and Guo Qiaofeng's groups are just one of thousands in the tractor factory.

The first generation of tractor manufacturers in the motherland has been born and grown up along with the first generation of tractors in the motherland. But this is just a victorious starting point, and they will move towards a more glorious future.

    为了实现亲人的愿望
    本报记者　张健虹　陆笑萍　刘健生
    第一拖拉机制造厂建成的喜讯，像一声春雷，震荡在五亿农民的心里。仅仅只有四年光景，人们看到这样的巨变，谁能不激动呢？
    在这比洛阳旧城面积还要大的工厂场地上，宏伟的建筑群一眼望不到边。那专用线上的运料列车，呜呜鸣叫，八十米高的热电站烟囱，吐着团团的烟云。在厂区，绿树掩映着红楼，中央大道的街心花园和道路两侧，是一片片颜色斑斓的花圃和茂密的灌木……
    十九分钟一台拖拉机
    在这个工厂里，各车间、各工部、各工段完整得和一个人体一样，相互紧密衔接着，配合着。高度机械化的生产过程，使这里的劳动，变得分外轻松。铸钢工场的碾砂、拌砂、筛砂、造型、浇铸、落砂、清理等工序都由机械操纵，因而现场上工人稀少，而各种输送带却盘绕如环，一溜溜砂箱随着浇铸的快慢，在滚道上徐徐行进，直到铸件冷却、最后落入地下输送带上，送给有关车间使用，全都不用人工搬运。
    全厂的二百二十二条流水作业线，像大小溪流，最后通到总装配线，它们全都按照十九分钟出一台拖拉机的总节奏组织自己的生产。在总装配线上，发动机、散热箱、底盘，都在设计规定的分秒以内，由机械操纵装配。每一台车身装完，那遥隔一条马路的冲压工场，便准时由露天运输带把拖拉机驾驶室壳体送来……于是，一台台大红色玫瑰色的拖拉机在喷漆间穿上漂亮的外衣，挂上了履带，就威风凛凛地跑出了工场，发出隆隆的响声。
    武装自己的英雄
    在车间里我们看到了数不尽的又高大又精密的机床，这些机床除了苏联支援我们的以外，还有上海、大连、沈阳、济南等地制造的机床。但是那高周波淬火机、龙门铣、马弗炉、冲天炉、转炉、电炉等等一大部分机械化设备，却是“第一拖拉机制造厂”造的。据统计：全厂90％的设备是国内制造的，其中有20％的标准设备和90％以上的非标准设备是这个厂工人自己武装自己制造出来的。
    厂党委发出以武装生产拖拉机的第一线——铸钢铸铁车间为重点加速武装自己的号召后，铆焊组三十多个人，连续苦战十天，把半年才能完成的武装铸钢车间急需的输送带，全部完成了。两千多块七、八米厘厚一米多宽的钢板，都必须用手锤把它的四周弯一道边。他们抡起一、二十公斤重的铁锤，一刻也不停地敲打着钢板，手心里磨起了血泡，汗水浸透了棉袄，但是谁也不下火线。顾胜林在苦干中加上巧干，研究制成了一个冲模，提高加工效率四十倍。在拖拉机厂的任何一条生产线上都有这样的英雄事迹。
    与农民兄弟心连心
    这儿的工人深切地关心着农村里的每一个变化，农民要求机械化的愿望，深深打动了他们的心。这不仅因为他们肩负着支援农业机械化的使命，而且还由于他们大部分来自农村。到工厂时，他们的父兄、伯叔、邻里向他们说过：“希望你们快点造出拖拉机来！我们最需要拖拉机！”这是一个多么了不起的动力呀！
    我们记得，在去年全国农村实现人民公社化的时候，全厂设备还有40％没有到厂。人们一面修建尚未完工的厂房，一面为了提前在“八一”出“东方红”拖拉机，没昼没夜地艰苦奋战。铸工间没有冲压设备，人们就用手锤敲打钢板，做成了驾驶室壳体，加工大零件没有机床，就用蚂蚁啃骨头的方法克服了困难。在这个时候，发动机工场的工人朱广富趁假期回到了上海乡下，母亲见面就问：“孩子！我们这里已经公社化了，你们的拖拉机很快就要出来了吧？”这个做发动机转向管“接头”的年轻人，回厂后大干特干起来。他对人们说：“再不努力干，就对不起共产党！也对不起母亲！”过去一天干二百个接头，这时一天完成九百个。他改进了几种工具，将自己负责加工的拖拉机发动机上的八种零件，提高了效率三倍到四倍。
    一代新人
    祖国的第一批拖拉机出世了。随着，祖国第一代拖拉机制造工人也成长起来了。也许人们很难设想，这些在一二年前刚刚走出学校的孩子，或者刚刚放下锄头的农民，怎么会很快地就登上了这个近代技术的高峰的呢？让我们举一个例子来看吧。制造燃油泵上的呼吸气管——喷油咀，是很精密的活儿，每个零件公差都不允许超过一根头发丝的七十分之一，但是加工这个喷油咀的各个零件的却是一群非常年轻的姑娘。一个是二十一岁的杨惠芬领导的座面组，一个是十九岁的郭巧凤领导的油针组。由于她们在党的关怀和苏联专家的帮助下，认真学习掌握了技术，她们负责加工的油针、油针体、止回阀、止回阀座等在质量和产量方面，都达到而且超过了苏联设计水平。像杨惠芬、郭巧凤组这样的事例，在拖拉机厂，只是千万个当中的一例。
    祖国的第一代拖拉机制造者，已经随着祖国第一代拖拉机一同诞生，一同成长。但这不过是一个胜利的起点，他们将朝着更加辉煌的前景迈进。
