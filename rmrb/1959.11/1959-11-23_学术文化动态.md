Soviet Scholars Discuss Methodology for Critiquing Modern Bourgeois Philosophy

The Soviet scholar Narski recently published an article in "Philosophical Science" issue number two, titled "On Methodological Issues in Critiquing Modern Bourgeois Philosophy." The article points out that modern bourgeois philosophy comes in many guises, such as "existential philosophy," "phenomenology," "critical ontology," "critical realism," "logical empiricism," "scientific philosophy," and "humane personalism," among others. This phenomenon is not only because false philosophies can take countless forms, but also because the fierce debates among bourgeois philosophers are often the result of competition in the capitalist ideological marketplace, with the aim of masking their true unity on an idealist foundation. In particular, it should be noted that the main reason why modern bourgeois philosophical schools appear so "colorful" is that these schools collectively demonstrate the profound crisis and disintegration of the bourgeois worldview. Faced with the achievements of the socialist camp and its scientific accomplishments, bourgeois philosophers are unable to correctly answer the questions posed by real life, and unable to correctly solve the epistemological problems raised by contemporary natural science based on their anti-dialectical approach.

However, in the past two decades, a new trend has emerged: a relative convergence of various bourgeois philosophical schools. But this does not mean that the crisis of bourgeois philosophical thought has been overcome, but rather that bourgeois philosophers are attempting to use arguments from various schools to conduct a common struggle—against dialectical materialism. Nevertheless, the various schools of bourgeois philosophy have not yet reached the point where the basic factions have lost their characteristics, and new eclectic variations continue to emerge.

After the war, no bourgeois writer abroad has produced a worthwhile work that has been recognized as decent by bourgeois critics. This shows that bourgeois philosophy is in a state of prolonged stagnation. Currently, the four basic schools of bourgeois philosophy, namely, neo-positivism, pragmatism, existentialism, and neo-Thomism, still have considerable influence. These four major schools reflect different, yet often essential, aspects of modern bourgeois consciousness.

The author points out that in pointing out the great differences among bourgeois philosophical schools, it is necessary to specifically and historically analyze each school, to convincingly prove where these or those bourgeois philosophers are ultimately going, and to pay close attention to the content of their mutual debates. It is wrong to only analyze the worldviews of these philosophers and ignore the differences between them.

Finally, the author points out that the critique of modern bourgeois philosophy is not a short-term movement, but a regular and very important theoretical task.

East Germany Holds Conference to Discuss Feuerbach's Works

From January 14 to 17, 1959, the German Democratic Republic held an international philosophical conference in Berlin to discuss Feuerbach's works. The conference was initiated by the Philosophical Research Group of the Academy of Sciences of the German Democratic Republic. In addition to the initiators, delegations from the Academies of Sciences of Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Poland also participated in the conference.

Professor Marek Fritzhand presented the first report at the conference, entitled "Marxist Humanism and Feuerbach's Humanism." Fritzhand argued that Marx's humanism and Feuerbach's humanism have essential similarities. He said that Engels' sharp criticism of Feuerbach's humanism and ethical views was mainly due to the political situation in Germany at the time, rather than the objective value of those views. Thus, Fritzhand concluded that a model ethical system of Marxism can largely be derived based on the practical and theoretical value of Feuerbach's humanism.

Fritzhand's opinion was met with considerable sharp criticism at the conference, especially from philosophers from the German Democratic Republic. They argued that although Feuerbach's critique of religion was a source of Marxism, Feuerbach's humanism and ethics contradicted his own philosophy and critique of religion. Therefore, his humanism and ethics did not have a significant impact on Marx. It is even questionable how much influence Feuerbach's philosophy and critique of religion had on Marx's philosophy.

However, some people supported Fritzhand's opinion, based on the fact that from some of Marx's early papers, correspondence between Marx and Feuerbach, and correspondence between Marx and Engels, it cannot be denied that Feuerbach's theory was once the starting point for Marxist philosophy and ethics.

This discussion went far beyond the scope of the history of philosophy. Participants also studied general issues, such as the definition of humanism in modern Marxist philosophy, and the relationship between the definition of humanism and a series of conclusions of historical materialism.

The German Democratic Republic has recently published many of Feuerbach's works. The Philosophical Research Group of the German Academy of Sciences is currently planning to publish "The Complete Works of Feuerbach," which contains newly discovered materials and new research insights.

    苏联学者谈批判现代资产阶级哲学的方法论
    苏联学者纳尔斯基最近在“哲学科学”第二期上发表了一篇“论现代资产阶级哲学批判的方法论问题”的文章，指出现代资产阶级哲学名目繁多，什么“生存哲学”、“现象学”、“批判的本体论”、“批判的现实主义”、“逻辑经验主义”、“科学的哲学”、“人道的人格主义”等等。这种现象不仅是由于虚假的哲学可以千变万化，而且是由于资产阶级哲学家之间的激烈论战常常是资本主义思想市场上竞争的结果，其论战的目的无非是为了掩饰他们在唯心主义基础上的真正的一致。特别是应当看到，现代资产阶级哲学流派所以“缤纷多采”的主要原因在于：这些流派共同表现了资产阶级世界观的深刻危机和分崩离析。在社会主义阵营的成就及其科学成就面前，资产阶级哲学家无力正确回答现实生活提出的问题，无力在其反辩证法的基础上正确解决当代自然科学所提出的认识论问题。
    可是，近二十年来还出现了一种新的趋势：各资产阶级哲学流派相对地接近了。但是，这并不意味着资产阶级哲学思想的危机克服了，而是说明资产阶级哲学家企图利用各派的论据来进行共同的斗争——反对辩证唯物主义。虽然如此，资产阶级哲学各派却还没有达到各基本派别失去其特征的地步，新的折衷主义的变种也还不是不再出现了。
    战后，在国外，资产阶级作家没有写出一本被资产阶级批评家公认为像样的有价值的著作。这说明资产阶级哲学处于长期停滞状态。目前，资产阶级哲学的四个基本派别，即新实证论、实用主义、生存主义和新托马斯主义，仍然有相当大的影响。这四大流派反映了不同的、然而常常是本质的现代资产阶级意识的各个方面。
    作者指出，在指出资产阶级哲学流派的千差万别时，要具体地、历史地分析各个流派，要令人信服地证明这些或那些资产阶级哲学家究竟走到哪里去，要密切注意他们自己之间互相争论的内容。如果只分析这些哲学家的世界观，而忽视他们之间的区别，那是错误的。
    最后，作者指出，对现代资产阶级哲学的批判不是一个短暂的运动，而是一项经常性的非常重要的理论工作。
    民主德国举行讨论费尔巴哈著作的会议
    1959年1月14日至17日，德意志民主共和国曾在柏林召开讨论费尔巴哈著作的国际哲学会议。会议的发起者是德意志民主共和国科学院哲学研究组。参加这次会议的除发起者之外，还有捷克、保加利亚和波兰等国科学院的代表团。
    马莱克·费利茨汉德教授在会上作了第一个报告，题目是“马克思主义的人道主义和费尔巴哈的人道主义”。费利茨汉德认为，马克思的人道主义和费尔巴哈的人道主义有本质上的类似性。他说，恩格斯之所以尖锐地批评费尔巴哈的人道主义与伦理观点，主要是由于当时德国的政治状况，而不是由于那些观点的客观价值。这样，费利茨汉德就得出如下结论：在很大程度上可以根据费尔巴哈人道主义的实践价值和理论价值得出马克思主义的典范的伦理体系。
    费利茨汉德的这种意见，在会上遭到了相当尖锐的批评，特别是德意志民主共和国哲学家的批评。他们认为，虽然费尔巴哈对宗教的批判是马克思主义的一个源流，但是费尔巴哈的人道主义和伦理学是与他自己的哲学和对宗教的批判相矛盾的，因此他的人道主义和伦理学对马克思并不起重大影响，甚至费尔巴哈的哲学和对宗教的批判对于马克思的哲学究竟起多大影响也可怀疑。
    然而，也有人支持费利茨汉德的意见，他们的根据是：从马克思青年时代所写的一些论文、马克思与费尔巴哈之间的来往信件、马克思与恩格斯之间来往的信件来看，却又无法否认费尔巴哈的理论曾经是马克思主义哲学与伦理学问题的出发点。
    这次讨论远远超出哲学史范围。与会者还研究了一般性问题，例如，在现代马克思主义哲学中人道主义的定义问题，以及人道主义定义同历史唯物主义的一系列结论的关系问题。
    德意志民主共和国近来出版了费尔巴哈的不少著作。德国科学院哲学研究组目前正在按计划出版“费尔巴哈全集”，这个全集中有新发现的材料和新的研究心得。
