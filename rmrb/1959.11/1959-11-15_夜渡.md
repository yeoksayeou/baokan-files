It was already very late.

The river water lapped against the ferryboat moored at the shore, making a monotonous "pa-pong, pa-pong" sound. The people on the ferry were getting a little impatient. The woman who operated the ferry, a slender figure in her thirties, was still standing on the shore.

"Why isn't the boat leaving yet?" someone yawned and said.

Another person shone a flashlight on their watch and said, "It's past eleven o'clock, shouldn't we be leaving? Isn't it stipulated that the last ferry leaves at eleven?"

At this, the seven or eight people on the boat all shouted, "Yes, let's go!"

"Let's go!"

"Be patient, everyone. There are still people coming from over there, can't you see?" The ferrywoman said loudly, without a care, and then shouted into the distance, "If you want to cross, hurry up!"

Everyone's eyes turned to the distance on the riverbank. Sure enough, the light of a flashlight was illuminating a figure moving in a swaying manner. But quite a while passed and they still hadn't arrived.

"Walking so slowly! Third Sister-in-law, let's go, don't wait for him." Two or three people who looked like workers said to the ferrywoman. It seemed they were familiar with her.

"What's the rush? Will waiting a little longer kill you?" Third Sister-in-law replied, and then shouted loudly, "Hey, hurry up, people are waiting!"

"Haha, I was wondering if you weren't getting anxious? You're not back yet so late, Third Brother must be very worried at home!" One of the workers said, causing the others to laugh.

"Go on with you! You're making fun of me!" Third Sister-in-law said, but then she couldn't help but giggle herself.

That person finally approached. By the light of the flashlight, one could see a woman in her twenties, carrying a shoulder pole with two loads, one end a small wooden box, the other end a long cotton bag, with a child on her back, head lowered, carefully watching the uneven sandy ground, walking step by step. When she reached the narrow gangplank, she hesitated. Third Sister-in-law took the pole from her shoulder, helped her onto the boat, and while rowing, asked her:

"Did you just arrive from the countryside by bus?"

"Mm," the young woman nodded.

"Your man works here?"

"Mm," still this restrained reply.

The boat reached the middle of the river. The night river wind blew, making people feel a slight chill.

"Hey, you as a mother really are something! You don't even know if it's cold or hot, quickly put something on the child to keep out the wind!" Third Sister-in-law suddenly scolded her as if she were scolding her own daughter.

The young woman was a little startled by this sudden scolding, but she didn't have any clothes with her, and looked back at the child, not knowing what to do.

"Really muddleheaded! Going out without even bringing a piece of clothing for the child!" Third Sister-in-law continued to scold her, and seeing a familiar worker wearing a jacket, she angrily said, "What are you standing there for? Give her your jacket!"

"Look at me... how could I not have thought of that?" The worker said apologetically, as if he had done something wrong, and quickly took off his jacket and handed it to the young woman.

"Hmph, your man didn't even come to pick you up!" Third Sister-in-law seemed to get into the swing of scolding, and shifted the blame to the young woman's husband.

"No, it's not that, you don't know!" The young woman, who had been silently responding to Third Sister-in-law, suddenly said in a low, but very certain voice.

"I know everything! These men in the factory are all obsessed with machines, and don't even remember their wives and children! My old ghost is the same!" Third Sister-in-law said, both scolding and praising.

"No, it's not," the young woman's tone became even more stubborn.

"It's not? Then why didn't he come to pick you up?"

"I didn't write a letter to tell him."

"What? Didn't tell your man? Look, I said you were muddleheaded, didn't I! Would picking you up delay some earth-shattering work?"

"Anyway, I can find my way myself, why should I delay him from working?" The young woman retorted without yielding an inch.

"You really are capable!" Third Sister-in-law said sarcastically, but with a kind smile on her face. Then she asked, "Which factory does your man work at?"

"Steel mill," her tone filled with unconcealable pride.

"Comrades, is there anyone here from the steel mill?" Third Sister-in-law asked the people on the ferry. Coincidentally, none of them were from the steel mill. Third Sister-in-law seemed to get angry again, and said to the young woman, "Good, the steel mill is seven or eight *li* from here! You're so capable, go find it yourself with the child!"

The boat approached the shore amidst Third Sister-in-law's scolding of the young woman. The young woman picked up her burden and went ashore, heading straight forward. Third Sister-in-law forcefully stuck the bamboo pole into the boat, and shouted:

"You don't even know the way, where are you going? Wait for me!"

"Third Sister-in-law, go home. I'll take her there," one of the workers said.

"You take her? Will you still work tomorrow?" Third Sister-in-law retorted in one sentence, turning around and saying to the young woman, "Come on, give me the burden."

"Tell me the way, I'll go find it myself."

"Hmph, you find it yourself! Do I know if you can find it?" Third Sister-in-law grabbed the burden and said, "Come with me."

The young woman obediently followed. Along the way, Third Sister-in-law continued to scold her about something.

They walked further and further away, the figures gradually blurring. Third Sister-in-law's faded clothes, weathered by wind and rain, became a cluster of light, illuminated by the factory lights.

    夜渡
    海粟
    已经很晚了。
    江水拍打着泊在岸边的渡船，发出单调的“啪嘭、啪嘭”的声音。渡船上的人等得都有点不耐烦了。撑渡船的，一个细挑身材、三十来岁的女人却还站在岸边。
    “怎么还不开船呢？”不知有谁打了个呵欠说。
    又有一个人用电筒照着看了一下手表，说，“十一点多了，该开船了吧？不是规定最后一班渡船在十一点开吗？”
    这一来，船上的七、八个人都喊起来：“是啊，开船罗！”
    “开船！”
    “大家耐耐性子。那边还有人来呢，看到没有？”撑渡船的女人毫不在意地大声说，跟着又向远处喊道：“要过渡，走快点罗！”
    大家的眼光都转向了江岸远处，果然有电筒光映着一个人影在一晃一晃地移动。可是过了好一会儿还没有走到。
    “走得这样慢！三嫂，开船，不等他了。”有两三个工人模样的人对摆渡的女人说。看来他们跟她熟识。
    “急什么？多等一会儿就困死你们了？”三嫂回答，随着又大声喊道：“喂，走快点，别人等着呢！”
    “哈哈，我说难道你就不着急？你这么迟还不回去，三哥在家里不知有多心焦呢！”工人里有一个说，引得别的人都笑起来了。
    “见你们的鬼！拿我开起玩笑来了！”三嫂说，可是跟着自己也噗哧一声笑了出来。
    那个人终于走近了。借着电筒光，可以看出一个二十多岁的女人，挑着一担东西，一头是一只小木箱，一头是一个长长的土布袋，背上还背着个孩子，低着头，小心看着高低不平的沙地，一步步走来，走到窄长的跳板前，就犹豫起来。三嫂从她肩头拿过担子，帮她上了船，一面划桨，一面问她：
    “刚从乡下搭车来吗？”
    “嗯，”年轻女人点了点头。
    “你男人在这里做工吧？”
    “嗯，”还是这拘束的回答。
    船到了江心。夜晚的江风吹来，使人感到一丝寒意。
    “喂，你这个做妈的真是！连个冷热都不晓得，快给孩子披上点东西挡挡风呀！”三嫂突然像责备自己的女儿似的责备她。
    年轻女人给这突然的责备弄得有点惊愕了，手边却又没有衣服，回头看了看孩子，不知该怎么办才好。
    “真是糊涂！出门连孩子的衣服都不拿一件！”三嫂继续责备她，一眼看到熟识的一个工人身上披着一件夹克，就生气地说，“你还楞着干什么？把你的衣服给她呀！”
    “看我……怎么就没想到呢？”这工人抱歉地说，真像是做了什么错事似的，赶紧脱下衣服来交给年轻女人。
    “哼，你男人也不来接你们一下！”三嫂似乎数说得来了劲，又拉到年轻女人的丈夫头上去了。
    “不是的，你不知道！”一直默默应着三嫂的年轻女人，这时忽然低声的、却很肯定的反对说。
    “我才知道呢！这些厂里的男人都是给机器迷住了心窍的，哪还记得老婆孩子！我那个老鬼也是一样的货！”三嫂又像是责备，又像是表扬地说。
    “不是的，”年轻女人的口气越发固执了。
    “不是？那他为什么不来接你？”
    “是我没有写信告诉他。”
    “怎么？没有告诉你男人？你看，我说你糊涂是不是！难道他来接接你就会耽误了天大的工作了？”
    “反正我自己找得到的，为啥要耽误他做工？”年轻女人一点不让步的反驳。
    “看你本事真大！”三嫂像是讽刺似的说，可是脸上却挂着好意的笑容。接着她又问道：“你男人是哪个厂的？”
    “炼钢厂，”口气里带着掩盖不住的骄傲。
    “同志，你们有哪个是钢厂的？”三嫂问渡船上的人们，碰巧，没有一个是钢厂的。三嫂显得又生起气来了，对年轻女人说：“好啊，钢厂离这里还有七、八里路呢！你本事大，就一个人拖着孩子去找吧！”
    船在三嫂对这年轻女人的数说声中拢了岸。年轻女人挑起担子上了岸，一个劲地往前走去。三嫂用力把竹篙插住了船，喊起来：
    “你路都不认识往哪儿走？等着我！”
    “三嫂，你回家吧。我送她去。”有一个工人说。
    “你送她？你明天还做工不做工？”三嫂一句话就把他顶了回去、转过身来对年轻女人说：“来，把担子给我。”
    “你告诉我路，我去找好了”。
    “哼，你自己去找！我晓得你找不找得到？”三嫂把担子抓过来说，“跟我走。”
    年轻女人顺从地跟着走了。一路上，三嫂还在不断地数说她什么。
    越走越远了，人影渐渐模糊。三嫂身上一套在风吹雨打中褪了色的衣服，在工厂的灯光的映照下，成了一团光亮。
