The Strong Vitality of the "Small Foreign Groups"

    On November 25th of last year, this newspaper published an editorial entitled "Rectification, Consolidation, and Improvement," discussing that the "small indigenous groups" of the steel industry had entered a new stage. The main task of this stage was to achieve "Five Fixes" (fix points, fix types, fix groups, fix personnel, fix leadership) and gradually and systematically build a number of small and medium-sized, integrated iron and steel bases combining indigenous and foreign methods (bases that people like to call "small foreign groups"). Now, a year has passed, and the "small indigenous groups" of the steel industry have basically completed the transition to "small foreign groups." Looking back at the development of the mass movement for steel production from "small indigenous groups" to "small foreign groups" over the past year, the hearts of all those who have contributed to the Great Leap Forward in Steel are filled with joy and excitement! The large-scale emergence of "small foreign groups" is a great victory for the Chinese people in implementing the General Line for Socialist Construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies.
    In just one year, on the basis of the "small indigenous groups," hundreds of small and medium-sized steel plants have emerged across the country, and thousands of small and medium-sized iron-smelting blast furnaces and steel-making converters have been built. Such a construction speed has never been seen in the history of the metallurgical industry. From the start of construction of China's first steel plant, the Hanyang Iron and Steel Works, in 1890, the volume of blast furnaces built in the long 59 years of old China was less than one-sixth of the volume of small and medium-sized blast furnaces built in the past year. During the First Five-Year Plan, we built more blast furnaces than in the past 59 years; however, the speed of construction in the past year has greatly exceeded the First Five-Year Plan. Growing simultaneously with the "small foreign groups" for iron and steel smelting are the "small foreign groups" for coking, the "small foreign groups" for mining, the "small foreign groups" for steel rolling, and so on. This force, growing like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, has played a significant role in completing this year's steel production plan. Small and medium-sized blast furnaces are responsible for half of the country's pig iron production, small and medium-sized converters are responsible for about a quarter of the country's steel production, and small and medium-sized mines are responsible for about half of the country's mining. In one year, China's steel production capacity has grown so significantly and can undertake such a huge production task. How can this not be a victory for the General Line?
    The vigorous development of the "small foreign groups" has not only greatly increased China's steel industry's production capacity, but also changed the layout of China's steel industry. Before liberation, only six provinces could produce pig iron, only eight provinces could produce steel, and only six provinces could produce steel materials. Most parts of the country did not have a steel industry. After three years of recovery and the construction during the First Five-Year Plan, this unreasonable industrial distribution began to change, but in terms of output, the vast majority was still concentrated in a few coastal provinces. Now, large and small steel enterprises have begun to appear in all regions of the country. This huge change in the layout of the steel industry not only enables us to better utilize the decentralized local resources and reduce the waste caused by long-distance transportation of raw materials and products, but also greatly promotes the development of production and construction in all parts of the country. "Take steel as the key link, and everything will fall into place." This is true for the whole country, and it is also true for various regions. Around the steel "small foreign groups," haven't many small and medium-sized coal mines already appeared? Haven't many small and medium-sized machinery factories already appeared? Haven't the transportation, chemical industry, petroleum industry, non-ferrous metal industry, and light industry of other "small foreign groups" all developed greatly? New factories and mines, like the spring breeze turning the earth green, are being built all over the country. How can this brand-new situation not be a victory for the General Line?
    Over the past year, the steel industry's "small foreign groups" have grown up in the continuous struggle against right-leaning thoughts. Those who advocated "more harm than good" once made three major conclusions about the "small foreign groups": low efficiency, poor quality, and high cost. They believed that the more the "small foreign groups" developed, the heavier the "burden" would become. What is the truth? The facts prove that the low efficiency, poor quality, and high cost of the "small foreign groups" are only temporary phenomena in the initial stage of their establishment. This phenomenon has begun to change, and their production efficiency, product quality, and production costs will be further improved in the future. The "small foreign groups" are not a "burden" at all, but a treasure for the high-speed development of socialist construction, a priceless treasure!
    First, let's look at efficiency. In the first quarter of this year, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces across the country was only 0.569 tons, which was indeed relatively low. However, by September of this year, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces across the country had increased to 0.825 tons. In areas where small blast furnace ironmaking is more advanced, such as Anhui, Shandong, Jiangsu, Yunnan, and Zhejiang provinces, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces has reached more than one ton, and the utilization coefficient of some advanced small blast furnaces has even reached more than two tons. If we recall the situation of improving the utilization coefficient of large blast furnaces in our country, we can better illustrate that the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces is not very low, but is improving very quickly. In 1949, the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces in our country was only 0.62 tons, and in 1952, the national average was only 1.02 tons. However, the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in many provinces, which were established less than a year ago, has reached or exceeded the national average level of large and medium-sized blast furnaces in 1952, under the condition that the raw material conditions are far inferior to those of large blast furnaces. Isn't this an extremely rapid improvement? Why is it understandable that the utilization coefficient of large blast furnaces was very low at the beginning (that is, the efficiency was very low), but the lower efficiency of small blast furnaces at the beginning has become a "crime" that should be attacked? What is this logic? Now, in less than a year, small blast furnaces have gone through the road that large blast furnaces took about three years to complete in terms of improving efficiency. Doesn't this completely refute the argument that the "small foreign groups" are a "burden"? The same is true for small converters. In January of this year, the average utilization coefficient of small converters across the country was only about four tons, which was indeed very low. However, now in advanced units, such as the small converters in Qingdao, the average utilization coefficient has reached 27.6 tons. It can be seen that the development prospects of small converters, like small blast furnaces, are bright and promising.
    Let's look at quality again. According to a survey of thirteen provinces and cities that produced more pig iron in April of this year, the qualification rate of pig iron from small blast furnaces at that time was about 30%, which was indeed very low. However, thanks to the efforts of the vast number of workers, the qualification rate of pig iron from small blast furnaces rose to 63% in May, 75% in June, 78.58% in July, and 79.53% in August. Furthermore, from a national perspective, there were already ten provinces with pig iron qualification rates above 80% in July, which increased to fifteen provinces in August and sixteen provinces in September. Among them, the pig iron qualification rates in Yunnan, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Shanxi provinces have all reached over 90%. Many small blast furnaces in Jiangsu, Hunan, Guizhou, and Shanxi provinces have pig iron qualification rates of 100%, which can be compared to the quality of pig iron from large blast furnaces. The qualification rate of converter steel is also improving very quickly, and now it is above 90%. It can be seen that the product quality of the steel industry's "small foreign groups" is also improving very quickly. However, it is necessary to further explain here that the product quality of the "small foreign groups" did have many problems some time ago. On the one hand, this is because they were newly established, lacked experience, and inevitably had many defects. On the other hand, the poor product quality of small blast furnaces and small converters in the past was not because small blast furnaces, small converters, or small enterprises themselves could not produce high-quality products, but because the time was too short to prepare the production conditions in all aspects. For example, the ore, refractory materials, and coke used in small blast furnaces were far inferior in quality to those used in large blast furnaces at the beginning. If small blast furnaces used the ore, refractory materials, and coke currently used in large blast furnaces, then it can be said with certainty that the quality of pig iron produced by small blast furnaces would be no lower than that of pig iron from large blast furnaces. Therefore, with the establishment of small-scale mining concentrators, refractory material plants, coal washing plants, and coking plants, the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces will gradually and rapidly improve.
    Let's look at the cost again. The high cost of the "small foreign groups" was once the most severe "crime" used by those with right-leaning thoughts to attack the "small foreign groups." They thought that they could at least stand on their feet on this point. But what is the truth? The higher cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces is also only a temporary phenomenon, which can be completely reduced, and is now beginning to be reduced significantly. According to statistics on the cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces in fifteen provinces and cities, it has already been reduced by 21% in the first quarter of this year, continued to fall by 15% in the second quarter, and fell by another 11% in September. In advanced areas, such as Yunnan Province, the cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces has begun to approach the cost level of large blast furnaces. Not long ago, a small blast furnace cost meeting convened by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry proposed to reduce the cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces to the level of large blast furnaces. Can this goal be achieved? Yes. The reason why the cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces is still relatively high at present, just like its product quality is still relatively poor, is mainly because the raw material conditions, transportation conditions, and equipment conditions are still relatively poor. As long as these conditions are appropriately improved, it will not be difficult to reduce the cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces to near the level of large blast furnaces. For example, many small blast furnace production units currently still rely on manual handling, which results in high costs. If it can be basically achieved to replace shoulder carrying and human pulling with small carts, etc., the cost per ton of pig iron can be reduced a lot. It can be seen that the potential for continuing to reduce the cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces is very large, and it is entirely possible to reduce the cost of pig iron from small blast furnaces to near the level of large blast furnaces. In fact, advanced units such as Shuicheng Iron and Steel Plant in Guizhou and Wanfu Iron and Steel Plant in Sichuan have already done so.
    The infinite vitality and unlimited prospects of the steel industry's "small foreign groups" prove that the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, especially the simultaneous development of large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and the simultaneous use of foreign and indigenous methods of production, are completely correct. A year ago, some comrades thought that the simultaneous development of large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and the simultaneous use of foreign and indigenous methods of production, was only a temporary expedient, and could only play a role in a short period of time. Now it should be seen that this is not a "temporary expedient," but a long-term policy for China's socialist construction, and it will not "only play a role in a short period of time," but will play a long-term role.
    There is no doubt that our industrial construction takes modern large-scale enterprises as the backbone. Socialist construction must achieve industrial modernization. Therefore, we must build many modern large-scale backbone enterprises and strive to adopt all advanced technologies. While developing the steel industry's "small foreign groups," we have not relaxed the construction of modern large-scale enterprises. The volume of large blast furnaces built last year greatly exceeded that of any previous year, and the volume of large blast furnaces built in the first half of this year has also made a leap forward. However, taking modern large-scale enterprises as the backbone and running a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises, and running enterprises using indigenous methods of production and semi-foreign and semi-indigenous methods of production, are not contradictory at all. Our country is a large country with an economically backward economy. For us, only by implementing the "walking on two legs" construction policy can we accelerate the pace of socialist industrialization. If we do not develop the steel "small foreign groups," it is obvious that we would not be able to complete and overfulfill the plan of 12 million tons of steel this year ahead of schedule.
    After a year, we have more and deeper knowledge of the policy of simultaneously developing large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and the policy of simultaneously using foreign and indigenous methods of production. The vigorous vitality and unlimited prospects of the "small foreign groups" have been fully displayed in front of us. Of course, we have no reason to be complacent. We must continue to develop the "small foreign groups." It is now particularly necessary to vigorously develop the "small foreign groups" in the transportation, coal, electricity, chemical, petroleum, and non-ferrous metal sectors to accelerate the pace of construction and meet the needs of the continued leap forward in the national economy. As for the steel industry's "small foreign groups," they also need to be further developed and improved. At present, the "small foreign groups" for mining, transportation, coking, and steel rolling are still lagging behind the "small foreign groups" for iron smelting and steelmaking, and need to be greatly strengthened. The "small foreign groups" for iron smelting and steelmaking also need to continue to carry out technical transformation, improve the utilization coefficient, improve the quality, and reduce the cost, so as to achieve a comprehensive and continued leap forward.
    The "small foreign groups," like the "large foreign groups," have unlimited prospects. Let us hold up the banner of the General Line for Socialist Construction even higher, better implement a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, and make our country's socialist construction cause continue to advance at a high speed!

### “小洋群”的强大生命力

    “小洋群”的强大生命力
    去年11月25日，本报以“整顿、巩固和提高”为题发表社论，论述钢铁工业的“小土群”已经进入一个新的阶段，这个阶段的主要任务是实现“五定”（定点、定型、定组、定员、定领导），并且逐步有计划地建设一批中小型的、土洋结合的钢铁联合基地（也就是人们喜欢叫做“小洋群”的基地）。如今，一年的时间过去了，钢铁工业的“小土群”已经基本上完成了向“小洋群”的过渡。回顾这一年来大炼钢铁的群众运动由“小土群”向“小洋群”的发展，所有对大炼钢铁尽过一臂之力的人们的心里充满了喜悦、兴奋的感情！“小洋群”的大量出现，是我国人民在贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针中取得的伟大胜利。
    仅仅不过一年的时间，在“小土群”的基础上，全国就出现了几百个中小型钢铁厂，建设起千百座中小型的炼铁高炉和炼钢转炉。这样的建设速度，是冶炼工业史上从来不曾有过的。从1890年我国第一个钢铁厂——汉阳钢铁厂开始建设起，旧中国的漫长的五十九年中，建设起来的高炉，还不到过去一年中建设起来的中小型高炉容积的六分之一。第一个五年计划期间，我们建设起来的高炉超过过去五十九年的成就；但是过去一年的建设的速度又大大地超过了第一个五年。同炼铁、炼钢的“小洋群”同时成长起来的，还有炼焦的“小洋群”，采矿的“小洋群”，轧钢的“小洋群”等等。这样一支像雨后春笋一般成长起来的生力军，在完成今年的钢铁生产计划中起了重大的作用。中小型高炉担负着全国半数的生铁生产任务，中小型转炉担负着全国四分之一左右的炼钢生产任务，中小型矿山担负着全国一半左右的采矿任务。一年的时间，我国钢铁生产能力有了这样巨大的增长，能够担负这样巨大的生产任务，这怎能说不是总路线的胜利呢？
    “小洋群”的蓬勃发展，不仅使我国钢铁工业的生产能力得到巨大的增长，而且使我国钢铁工业的布局发生了改变。解放前，我国能生产生铁的只有六个省，能生产钢的只有八个省，能生产钢材的也只有六个省，全国大部分地区都没有钢铁工业。经过三年的恢复和第一个五年计划期间的建设，这种工业分布不合理的状况开始有了改变，但是从产量上看，绝大部分仍然集中在沿海的少数省份。现在，在全国各个地区都开始有了或大或小的钢铁企业。钢铁工业布局的这个巨大改变，不仅使我们能够更好地利用分散的地方资源，减少了由于原料和产品的长途调运造成的种种浪费，而且大大促进了全国各地生产建设事业的发展。“以钢为纲，纲举目张”，全国是如此，各个地区也是如此。在钢铁“小洋群”的周围，不是已经出现了许许多多中小型的煤矿吗？不是已经出现了许许多多中小型的机械厂吗？其他“小洋群”的交通运输事业、化学工业、石油工业、有色金属工业和轻工业等等，不都有了很大的发展吗？新的工厂矿山，像春风吹绿大地一样在全国各地建设起来，这样一个崭新的局面，又怎能说不是总路线的胜利呢？
    一年来，钢铁工业的“小洋群”是在不断同右倾思想斗争中成长起来的。“得不偿失”论者曾经替“小洋群”下了三大结论：效率低、质量差、成本高，并且认为“小洋群”愈发展，背的“包袱”愈沉重。事实如何呢？事实证明“小洋群”效率低、质量差、成本高，都只是创立初期的暂时的现象，现在这种现象已经开始改变，而且今后还会进一步提高它的生产效率、提高它的产品质量、降低它的生产成本。“小洋群”非但不是“包袱”，而且是高速度发展社会主义建设事业的宝贝，是无价的宝贝！
    先看效率。今年第一季度，全国小高炉的平均利用系数还只有零点五六九吨，确实是比较低的，但到今年9月，全国小高炉的平均利用系数就提高到了零点八二五吨，小高炉炼铁比较先进的地区，如安徽、山东、江苏、云南、浙江等省，小高炉的平均利用系数已经达到一吨以上，有些先进的小高炉的利用系数甚至达到二吨以上。如果我们回忆一下我国大高炉利用系数提高的情况，就更可以说明小高炉利用系数不是很低，而是提高得很快。1949年我国高炉的利用系数只有零点六二吨，1952年全国平均也只有一点零二吨。而许多省诞生不到一年的小高炉的利用系数，在原料条件远不如大高炉的情况下，就已经达到或者超过了1952年全国大、中型高炉的平均水平。这不是提高得极其迅速吗？为什么大高炉在开始的时候利用系数很低（也就是效率很低），是可以理解的，而小高炉在开始的时候效率较低，就成了应该攻击的“罪状”呢？这是什么逻辑呢？现在还不到一年的时间，小高炉在提高效率方面，就走过了大高炉过去用三年左右的时间才走完的路程，这不就把“小洋群”是“包袱”的论断完全驳倒了吗？小转炉也是一样。今年1月，全国小转炉的平均利用系数只有四吨左右，这，确实是很低的，但是现在先进的单位，如青岛市的小转炉，平均利用系数已经达到二十七点六吨，可见小转炉的发展前途同小高炉一样，都是光明的、远大的。
    再看质量。根据今年4月份对十三个生产生铁较多的省、市的调查，当时小高炉生铁的合格率约为30％左右，确实是很低的，但是经过广大职工的努力，5月份小高炉生铁的合格率就上升为63％，6月份上升到75％，7月份又上升到78.58％，8月份再上升到79.53％。再从全国来看，7月份生铁合格率在80％以上的已经有十个省，8月份增加到十五个省，9月份又增加到十六个省，其中云南、湖南、浙江、山西等省的生铁合格率都达到90％以上，江苏、湖南、贵州、山西等省都有不少小高炉的生铁合格率达到100％，完全可以和大高炉生铁的质量比美。转炉钢的合格率也是提高得很快的，现在都在90％以上了。可见，钢铁工业“小洋群”的产品质量也是提高得很快的。但在这里，还需要进一步说明的是，前一些时候“小洋群”的产品质量确实是存在许多问题的，这一方面是因为它是刚刚生长出来的，经验不足，难免发生许多缺陷；另一方面，小高炉、小转炉的产品质量过去不好，并不是由于小高炉、小转炉或小的企业本身不可能生产高质量的产品，而是由于时间很短，还没有来得及把各方面的生产条件准备完善。例如小高炉所用的矿石、耐火材料、焦炭，在开始的时候在质量上远不如大高炉所使用的好，如果小高炉使用目前大高炉使用的矿石、耐火材料、焦炭，那就可以肯定地说，小高炉生产出来的生铁质量，绝不低于大高炉的生铁质量。因此，随着小型的矿山选矿厂、耐火材料厂、洗煤厂以及炼焦厂的建立，小高炉的生铁质量就一定会逐步地和迅速地提高。
    再看成本。“小洋群”成本高，这曾经是有右倾思想的人对“小洋群”攻击得最厉害的“罪状”。他们以为，至少在这一点上他们是站得住脚的。其实怎么样呢？小高炉生铁的成本比较高，也只是一种暂时的现象，是完全可以降低的，并且现在已经开始在大幅度地降低了。根据对十五个省、市小高炉生铁成本的统计，今年第一季度已经降低21％，第二季度又继续下降15％，9月份又下降11％。先进的地区，如云南全省的小高炉生铁成本，已经开始接近大高炉的成本水平。不久以前，冶金工业部召开的一次小高炉成本会议上，又提出要把小高炉生铁的成本降低到大高炉的水平。这个目标能不能实现呢？能。目前小高炉生铁的成本所以还比较高，就和它的产品质量还比较差一样，主要是因为原材料条件、运输条件、设备条件等还比较差。只要适当地改善这些条件，就不难把小高炉生铁的成本降低到接近大高炉的水平。例如，目前许多小高炉生产单位暂时还依靠人工搬运，因而费用很大，如果能基本上做到用小车等代替肩担人拉，就可以使每吨生铁的成本降低很多。可见，继续降低小高炉生铁成本的潜力大得很，把小高炉生铁的成本降低到接近大高炉的水平是完全可能的，而且事实上贵州水城钢铁厂和四川万福钢铁厂等先进单位已经做到了。
    钢铁工业“小洋群”无穷无尽的生命力和不可限量的前程，证明了党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，特别是大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，洋法生产和土法生产同时并举的方针是完全正确的。一年以前，有些同志还以为大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，洋法生产和土法生产同时并举，只不过是一时的权宜之计，只能在一个短时期内发生作用。现在应该看到，这不是什么“权宜之计”，而是我国社会主义建设的长远的方针，不是“只能在一个短时期内发生作用”，而是将长期发生作用。
    我们的工业建设以现代化大型企业为骨干，这是毫无疑问的。社会主义建设必须实现工业的现代化，因此，我们必须建设许多现代化的大型的骨干企业，必须力求采取一切先进技术。我们在发展钢铁工业的“小洋群”的同时，也没有放松过现代化的大型企业的建设。去年建成的大高炉的容积就大大超过了过去任何一年，今年上半年建成的大高炉的容积又有一个跃进。但是，以现代化大型企业为骨干和大量举办中小型企业，举办土法生产的企业和半洋半土的企业，是一点也不矛盾的。我们的国家是一个经济落后的大国，对于我们说来，只有实行“两条腿走路”的建设方针，才能加快社会主义工业化的速度。如果我们不发展钢铁“小洋群”，我们今年就不可能提前完成和超额完成一千二百万吨钢的计划，这是显而易见的。
    经过一年的时间，我们对大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，洋法生产和土法生产同时并举的方针，已经知道得更多更深了。“小洋群”的旺盛的生命力和无限的前途已经充分显示在我们的面前。当然，我们没有任何理由自满，我们还要继续发展“小洋群”，现在特别需要大力发展运输、煤炭、电力、化学、石油、有色金属等部门的“小洋群”，以加快建设速度，适应国民经济继续跃进的需要。就钢铁工业的“小洋群”来说，也还需要继续发展和提高。目前，采矿、运输、炼焦和轧钢的“小洋群”还落在炼铁和炼钢的“小洋群”后面，需要大大地加强，炼铁和炼钢的“小洋群”也还需要继续进行技术改造，把利用系数提得更高，把质量搞得更好，把成本降得更低，实现全面的继续跃进。
    “小洋群”同“大洋群”一样，前途无量。让我们更高地举起社会主义建设总路线的旗帜，更好地执行一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，使我国的社会主义建设事业继续高速度地前进！
