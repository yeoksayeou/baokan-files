Eliminate Right-leaning Thought, Boost Mass Enthusiasm, Launch a Manure Collection Campaign
Linru’s Hog Raising Doubles in 100 Days
Luoyang Prefectural Committee Requires All Counties to Learn from Linru’s High-Speed Hog Raising Experience

(Our Newspaper News) Henan Province, in carrying out a mass hog raising and manure collection campaign, has produced a red banner for high-speed hog raising and manure collection: Linru County's hog raising doubled in 100 days. The county's hog population increased from 90,882 in mid-July to 242,000 on October 25, a sharp increase of 1.7 times. In nine months, 2.41 million cartloads of pig manure (1,000 jin per cart) were collected.

Recently, the Luoyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site meeting in Linru to promote Linru's experience. Linru County proposed a friendship competition to all counties in Henan Province: to continue to achieve a great leap forward in hog raising and manure collection, to ensure that by the end of the year, each rural resident has one hog, and next year, each mu of land has one hog, providing a large amount of pig manure to promote the accelerated development of agricultural production.

Linru County is a hilly area with 1.1 million mu of land. The large-scale water conservancy construction movement since 1957 has expanded the irrigated area of the county to 560,000 mu. With water, more and better high-quality fertilizer is needed. Although there are many sources of fertilizer, digging up fertile soil and demolishing old walls can only solve the problem temporarily. Chemical fertilizers, under the current circumstances, cannot meet the large demand. Therefore, the main reliance is on hog raising and manure collection. For example, Yuanzhuang Brigade's wheat yield per mu was only 70 to 80 jin in the past. Last year, an average of more than 3,000 jin of pig manure was applied per mu, and this year the wheat yield per mu rose to 141 jin. Guo Zhuang Brigade accumulated 18,500 cartloads of pig manure in the first half of the year and applied it to 1,500 mu of wheat and autumn land, resulting in a yield of 971 jin per mu, an increase of more than 30% compared to the same land without pig manure application.

In mid-July, the Linru County Party Committee held an on-site hog raising meeting and announced a plan to develop the hog population to 300,000 by the end of the year. The masses' enthusiasm was high, and each commune planned to develop the hog population to 360,000 by the end of the year, greatly exceeding the requirements of the County Party Committee. However, those with right-leaning views said things like "no labor, no feed, no source of hogs, it will be impossible to complete the task of 300,000 hogs by the end of the year," and so on. The County Party Committee resolutely mobilized the masses to carry out large-scale airing of views, large-scale debate, thoroughly criticized right-leaning conservative thinking, and repeatedly publicized that hog raising is a fundamental measure for agricultural production, explaining that only with a great development of the hog raising enterprise can the source of fertilizer for agricultural production be guaranteed. In this way, the enthusiasm of the masses throughout the county was boosted, and a massive mass hog raising and manure collection campaign was launched while fighting drought to ensure a good harvest.

In the hog raising and manure collection campaign, Linru County conscientiously implemented the "five main" principles of "collective raising as the mainstay, self-breeding and self-raising as the mainstay, substitute feed as the mainstay, epidemic prevention as the mainstay, and manure collection as the mainstay." At the same time, mass movements were vigorously carried out, mobilizing brigades, production teams, canteens, homes for the elderly, government offices, and schools to establish pig farms, and everyone took action to raise hogs. The county universally promoted the three-guarantee (guarantee feed, guarantee expenses, guarantee epidemic prevention), five-fixing (fix breeding, fix manure collection, fix remuneration, fix fatness, fix rewards), four-fixed (fixed feeders, number of hogs, tools, pigsties) and the "three awards" (breeding and conception award, piglet production exceeding quota award, full-month survival and strong growth award) system in breeding and reproduction. At the same time, ideological education for feeders was strengthened, and the feeding team was conscientiously rectified and strengthened, requiring them to be both a feeding team and a manure collection team.

Currently, the county has revised its original plan to develop the hog population to 300,000 by the end of the year to 400,000, and plans to develop it to 1.1 million next year. And strive for each hog to accumulate an average of 7,000 jin of high-quality fertilizer this winter and next spring, for a total of 2.8 billion jin of fertilizer, providing sufficient fertilizer for the county's 560,000 mu of wheat next year.
Linru's hog raising competition proposal was first responded to by counties and cities in the Luoyang area. All counties and cities have revised their hog development plans. By the end of the year, the entire area will retain 1.81 million hogs, 310,000 more than the planned number by the Luoyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

### 肃清右倾思想　鼓起群众干劲　开展积肥运动  临汝养猪百日翻一番  洛阳地委要求各县学习临汝高速度养猪经验

    肃清右倾思想　鼓起群众干劲　开展积肥运动
    临汝养猪百日翻一番
    洛阳地委要求各县学习临汝高速度养猪经验
    本报讯　河南省在开展群众性养猪积肥运动中，出现了一面高速度养猪积肥的红旗——临汝县养猪百日翻番，全县生猪由7月中旬的九万零八百八十二头，发展到10月25日的二十四万二千头，猛增一点七倍；九个月来，积了猪肥二百四十一万车（每车千斤）。
    最近，中共洛阳地委在临汝召开了现场会议，推广临汝的经验。临汝县向河南全省各县提出了开展友谊竞赛的倡议：继续实现养猪积肥工作大跃进，保证年底达到农村人口每人一头猪，明年每亩地一头猪，提供大量猪肥，以促进农业生产加速发展。
    临汝县是一个丘陵地带，有一百一十万亩土地。1957年以来的大搞水利建设运动，使全县水浇地面积扩大到五十六万亩。有了水，就需要更多、更好的优质肥料。肥料来源虽广，但扒壮土、拆旧墙只能暂时解决问题；化肥在目前的情况下，还不能满足大量的需要。因此，主要靠养猪积肥。如袁庄大队过去小麦亩产仅七、八十斤，去年每亩平均施猪肥三千多斤，今年小麦亩产量上升到一百四十一斤。郭庄大队，上半年积猪粪一万八千五百车，施到一千五百亩麦秋地里，结果亩产九百七十一斤，比未施猪肥的同样土地增产三成以上。
    7月中旬，临汝县委召开了养猪现场会议，宣布了年底发展到三十万头的计划，群众情绪高涨，各公社规划年底发展到三十六万头，大大超过了县委的要求。但是，抱有右倾观点的人却说什么“没劳力，没饲料，没猪源，年底完不成三十万头的任务”等等。县委坚定地发动群众，开展大鸣大放大辩论，彻底批判了右倾保守思想，反复宣传了养猪是农业生产的一项根本措施，说明只有养猪事业大发展，农业生产的肥源才有保障。这样，就鼓足了全县群众的干劲，在抗旱保丰收的同时，开展了一个声势浩大的群众性的养猪积肥运动。
    临汝县在养猪积肥运动中，认真地执行了“以集体喂养为主，以自繁自养为主，以代饲料为主，以防疫为主，以积肥为主”的五主方针，同时大搞群众运动，发动大队、生产队、食堂、敬老院、机关、学校办养猪场，大家动手养猪。全县普遍推行了三包（包饲料，包开支，包防疫）、五定（定繁殖，定积肥，定报酬，定膘情，定奖励）、四固定（固定饲养员、生猪头数、用具、猪舍）和配种繁殖方面的“三奖”（配种受孕奖、产仔猪超额任务奖、满月全活全壮奖）制度。同时，加强了对饲养员的思想教育，认真整顿和加强了饲养队伍，要求他们做到既是饲养队伍，又是积肥队伍。
    目前，全县将原来年底发展生猪三十万头的计划，修订为四十万头，明年发展到一百一十万头。并且力争今冬明春每头猪平均积攒优质肥料七千斤，共积肥二十八亿斤，为明年全县五十六万亩小麦提供充足的肥料。
  临汝的养猪竞赛倡议，首先得到了洛阳专区各县市的响应。各县市纷纷修订了生猪发展计划，到年底，全区保留一百八十一万头猪，比中共洛阳地委的计划数字，多三十一万头。
