Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 2nd: The Third National Congress of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea solemnly opened in Pyongyang today.

There were 990 delegates attending the conference. Korean Workers' Party and government leaders, including Premier Kim Il-sung, Kim Il, Hong Myung-hee, Park Jung-ae, Park Kim-chul, Kim Chang-man, Jung Il-ryong, and Nam Il, were elected by the workers as delegates to this congress and attended today's meeting.

The World Federation of Trade Unions delegation, headed by S.A. Dange, Secretary of the Secretariat of the WFTU, the Soviet trade union delegation, headed by Musakhanov, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, the Chinese trade union delegation, headed by Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and trade union delegations from fraternal countries such as Mongolia, Vietnam, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, were invited to attend the conference.

Kim Chang-man, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, read the letter from the Central Committee of the Labor Party to the Congress at the meeting. The letter praised the Korean working class for responding to the call of the Party, displaying indomitable fighting spirit and revolutionary vigor, and creating great achievements in the arduous struggle of post-war economic recovery and socialist construction. The letter pointed out that the central tasks of the trade union at present are: to vigorously carry out communist education for workers; and to improve the technical and cultural level of workers. The letter emphasized that the trade union, as a faithful assistant to the Party, must mobilize the broad masses of workers to struggle for a new upsurge in socialist construction.

Li Hyo-soon, Chairman of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, delivered a summary report on the work of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea at the meeting.

The report described the achievements of various socialist emulation campaigns from the "Restoration Shock Movement" to today's "Chollima Workteam Movement." The report stated that it was precisely because the Korean working class displayed collective heroism and launched a collective innovation movement that the industrial production of Korea was guaranteed to develop at a high speed of 40% per year after the war, and that the great victory of completing the industrial output value plan of the First Five-Year Plan two and a half years ahead of schedule was achieved.

The report said that a large number of production innovators have emerged in the widely launched collective innovation movement. From 1957 to the end of September this year alone, 66 people have been awarded the title of Labor Hero of the Republic, and more than 24,000 people have received various medals and awards.

The report said that the socialist emulation campaign is developing towards a new and higher stage. The "Chollima Workteam Movement" initiated by the Chen Yingyuan Workteam of the Kangson Steel Plant in March this year is developing in various economic sectors. By the end of September this year, 1,820 workteams across the country had participated in this movement, and 78 workteams had won the honorary title of "Chollima Workteam".

The report said that the task of the "Chollima Workteam Movement" is to enable each participant to cooperate closely with each other in all areas of life such as production and labor, to help and educate backward workers, and to make them catch up with the level of advanced workers, so as to ensure that everyone lives and works in the spirit of communism. The report requires that trade union organizations at all levels must support and help the workers in all aspects to launch this movement in the revolutionary upsurge, so as to further expand and develop it, and thus become a powerful driving force for promoting socialist construction.

The report pointed out that it is necessary to further launch the movement of invention and rationalization proposals, and workers must actively participate in production management and give full play to their enthusiasm and creative spirit.

The report said that with the rapid recovery and development of industry, the number of employees in Korea has increased from 260,000 in 1946 to nearly 1.5 million at present. Therefore, trade union organizations at all levels must cultivate workers into new builders of socialism and communism armed with communist ideology through various political and cultural activities. At the same time, it is necessary to rapidly improve the technical and cultural level of workers.

When talking about the improvement of the living standards of Korean workers, the report said that in 1958, the monetary wages of Korean workers had increased to 2.6 times that of the pre-war 1949, and this year it increased by 40% compared with last year. At the same time, the prices of necessities in Korea have been reduced seven times since the war, and prices have been reduced by more than half. In the five years after the war until last year, the state built residential buildings with a construction area of 8.88 million square meters for employees. When talking about the need to strive to improve the lives of workers, the report pointed out that remuneration for labor must strictly abide by the socialist distribution principle, and the supply work for workers, especially the supply of non-staple food, must be improved.

The report said that by the end of June this year, the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea had 1,470,816 members, and trade union organizations had been established in all factories and mines in northern Korea.

The report expressed the warm support of all workers in northern Korea to the workers in South Korea. The report said that the working class in South Korea is today suffering the greatest persecution and suffering under colonial oppression and exploitation. At present, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed in South Korea has reached 6.6 million. South Korean workers are constantly fighting to improve their living conditions and fight for democratic rights, and are increasingly frequently carrying out direct struggles against the Syngman Rhee clique and the occupation of US imperialism.

The report called on South Korean workers to launch a resolute struggle to force the US military to immediately withdraw from South Korea and to overthrow the anti-people rule of Syngman Rhee. The working classes of North and South Korea should unite closely and guide the Korean people to continue their unyielding struggle to realize the peaceful reunification plan put forward by the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government.

The meeting will be held for five consecutive days. At this meeting, the constitution of the General Federation of Trade Unions will be revised, and the central leading body of the General Federation of Trade Unions will be re-elected.

    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长金昌满在会上宣读了劳动党中央委员会给大会的信。信中赞扬朝鲜工人阶级响应党的号召，发挥了不屈不挠的斗志和革命干劲，在战后经济恢复建设和社会主义建设的艰苦斗争中，创造了伟大的业绩。信中指出，工会当前的中心任务是：大力展开对工人的共产主义教育；提高工人的技术文化水平。信中强调说，工会作为党的忠实助手，要动员广大工人群众，为在社会主义建设中掀起新的高潮而斗争。
    朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会委员长李孝淳在会上作了关于朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会工作的总结报告。
    报告叙述了从“恢复突击运动”到今天的“千里马作业班运动”各种社会主义竞赛所取得的成就。报告说，正是由于朝鲜的工人阶级发挥了集体英雄主义，展开了集体革新运动，才保证了朝鲜战后的工业生产以每年增长40％的高速度发展，才能获得了提前两年半完成第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划的伟大胜利。
    报告说，在广泛展开的集体革新运动中，涌现出了大批的生产革新者。仅自1957年到今年9月底为止，就有六十六人荣获共和国劳动英雄的称号，有两万四千多人获荣各种勋章和奖章。
    报告说，社会主义竞赛运动正在向着新的更高的阶段发展。今年3月由降仙炼钢厂陈应源作业班发起的“千里马作业班运动”正在向各个经济部门中发展。到今年9月底，全国各地已经有一千八百二十个作业班参加了这个运动，并且已经有七十八个作业班获得了“千里马作业班”的光荣称号。
    报告说，“千里马作业班运动”的任务是，使每一个参加者在生产劳动等一切生活领域中互相紧密合作，帮助和教育落后的工人，使他们赶上先进工人的水平，从而保证所有的人以共产主义的精神生活和劳动。报告要求职业总同盟各级组织必须从各个方面支持和帮助工人在革命高潮中发起的这一运动，使它进一步扩大和发展，从而成为促进社会主义建设的强大的推动力。
    报告指出，要进一步展开创造发明和合理化建议运动，并且必须使工人积极参加生产管理，充分发挥他们的热情和创造精神。
    报告说，随着工业的迅速恢复和发展，朝鲜的职工人数已经由1946年的二十六万增加到目前的将近一百五十万。因此，职业总同盟各级组织要通过各种政治文化生活把工人培养成以共产主义思想武装起来的新的社会主义和共产主义的建设者。同时，要迅速提高工人们的技术和文化水平。
    报告在谈到朝鲜工人生活水平的提高时说，1958年，朝鲜职工的货币工资已经增加到相当于战前1949年的二点六倍，今年又比去年增加了40％。同时，朝鲜的生活必需品价格在战后降低了七次，物价降低了一半以上。到去年为止的战后五年内，国家为职工兴建了八百八十八万平方米建筑面积的住宅。报告在谈到必须为改善职工的生活而努力时指出，对劳动的报酬要严格遵守社会主义分配原则，要改善对职工的供应工作，特别是副食品的供应。
    报告说，到今年6月底为止，朝鲜职业总同盟已经有一百四十七万零八百一十六名盟员，朝鲜北部所有的厂矿企业中都建立了职业同盟的组织。
    报告表示朝鲜北部全体工人热烈声援南朝鲜工人，报告说，南朝鲜的工人阶级今天在殖民地的压迫和剥削中正受着最大的迫害和苦难，目前南朝鲜失业和半失业者已达六百六十万。南朝鲜的工人正在不断为改善生活条件和争取民主权利而进行斗争，并且日益频繁地对李承晚集团和美帝国主义的占领进行直接的斗争。
    报告号召，南朝鲜工人应该为迫使美军立即撤出南朝鲜，为推翻李承晚的反人民的统治制度而展开坚决斗争，南北朝鲜的工人阶级应该紧紧地团结在一起，引导朝鲜人民为实现朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府提出的和平统一方案而继续进行顽强的斗争。
    会议将连续举行五天，在这次会议上要修改职业总同盟的章程，改选职业总同盟的中央领导机构。
