Strengthen Equipment Maintenance to Ensure Safe Production
Beijing Crane Factory Loves Machines and Exceeds Plans Every Month

    (Our report) The Beijing Crane Factory constantly pays attention to the maintenance of machinery and equipment, achieving "both making the horse run fast and keeping the horse in good condition," ensuring the smooth continuation of the production leap forward.

    This factory has exceeded its production plans every month since the beginning of this year, while machinery and equipment accidents have decreased month by month. In the third quarter, the utilization rate of the factory's machinery and equipment rose to its highest point this year, and the accident rate of machinery and equipment fell to its lowest point this year. October was the month with the highest output value for the entire factory, with only one machinery and equipment accident occurring, eight fewer than in September.

    Paying attention to regular equipment maintenance and inspection has almost become a habit among workers. Workers do everything possible to maintain machines, use them very carefully, and automatically supervise each other. During shift changes, they strictly check the maintenance of machines. Many workers check machines several times a day, just like nursery workers in kindergartens take the temperature of children several times a day.

    The factory's employees not only attach importance to the maintenance of machinery and equipment in their minds, but also have complete systems, specific measures, and strict inspections. Based on the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, the entire factory, through mass discussion, re-established the "Machinery and Equipment Maintenance Management System" this year, dividing the authority for factory departments, offices, workshops, and groups to manage and maintain machinery and equipment at different levels, so that each level is responsible and everyone is responsible. In addition, it also absorbed safety production activists from various workshops and groups to be "maintenance workers," insisting on holding a "Maintenance Equipment Conference" once a week to exchange experience in maintaining machinery and equipment and to arrange new maintenance tasks. Through "maintenance workers," the importance of maintaining machines and safe production is deeply promoted among the workers. The entire factory conducts a major equipment inspection every quarter; offices, workshops, groups, and individuals adhere to small inspections every month, every ten days, and every day. At present, more than 90% of the workers in the entire factory have received safety production pass certificates through the annual safety examination. The factory has also changed the system of having the maintenance workshop and the production workshop work and rest at the same time to staggered work and rest, so that maintenance workers can repair machines in a timely manner when production workers are resting.

    The factory also pays attention to closely integrating the maintenance of machinery and equipment with the mass technical innovation movement. Through technical innovation, reasonable adjustment of processes, and improvement of tools, the factory fully and reasonably utilizes the effectiveness of machinery and equipment, ensuring the continuous and smooth great leap forward in production. The factory's Party committee insists on organizing all workers to learn technology and culture, so that workers can understand the "temperament" of the machines and increase their theoretical and technical knowledge. It also uses visits, competitions, and other methods to exchange the experience of "skillful work." Since the fourth quarter, employees have been doing more and more work, but the machines have become more and more obedient, and there are fewer and fewer problems.

    Currently, the factory is seizing the last two months of the fourth quarter, strengthening the maintenance of machinery and equipment, and ensuring that a batch of machines will be repaired before the end of the year to conserve energy and prepare for the continued leap forward in production next year.

    加强设备维修保证安全生产
    北京起重机厂人人爱护机器月月超额完成计划
    本报讯　北京起重机厂经常注意机器设备的维修工作，做到“既叫马儿快快跑，又要马的膘儿好”，保证了生产顺利地继续跃进。
    这个厂今年以来月月超额完成生产计划，机器设备事故却逐月减少。第三季度全厂机器设备利用率上升到今年以来的最高点，机器设备事故的发生率下降到今年以来的最低点。10月份是全厂产值最高的一个月，全厂只发生了一起机器设备事故，比9月份减少了八起。
    注意经常性的设备维护和检查，在工人中几乎成为习惯。工人们千方百计地维修机器，使用机器十分细心，并自动地互相监督，在交接班时严格检查机器保养维护情况，许多工人一天检查几次机器，就像托儿所的保育员每天给孩子试几次体温一样。
    这个工厂的职工不仅思想上重视机器设备的维修，而且制度完备、措施具体、检查严格。全厂根据去年大跃进中的经验，通过群众讨论，今年重新制定了“机器设备维修管理制度”，划分了厂部、科室、车间、小组分级管理维修机器设备的权限，做到层层负责、人人负责。此外还吸收各车间、小组的安全生产积极分子做“维修员”，每周坚持开一次“维修设备会议”，交流维修机器设备的经验，布置新的维修任务，通过“维修员”在职工群众中深入宣传维修机器、安全生产的重要性。全厂每季度进行一次设备大检查；科室、车间、小组、个人，每月、每旬、每天都坚持小检查。目前全厂已经有90％以上的工人，通过一年一度的安全考试，领到了安全生产及格证。这个厂又把维修车间和生产车间同时作息的制度改变为交叉作息。使生产工人休息时，维修工人能及时地检修机器。
    这个厂还注意了使机器设备的维护工作同群众性的技术革新运动密切结合起来，通过技术革新、合理调整工艺、改进工具等措施，充分合理地发挥机器设备的效用，保证生产持续地、顺利地大踏步跃进。工厂的党委坚持组织全体工人学习技术和文化，让工人们摸清楚机器的“脾气”，增加理论技术知识；还运用参观、评比等方式，交流“巧干”的经验。第四季度以来，职工们活儿干的越来越多，机器反而越来越听使唤，毛病也越来越少了。
    目前，这个厂正在抓紧第四季度最后两个月的时间，加强机器设备的维修工作，保证要在年底以前再赶修出一批机器，养精蓄锐，迎接明年生产继续跃进。
