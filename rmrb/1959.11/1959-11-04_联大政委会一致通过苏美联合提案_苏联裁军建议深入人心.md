Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee concluded its discussion on the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament on the evening of November 2nd, and unanimously adopted the Soviet-U.S. joint proposal.

This agenda item was discussed for a total of three weeks, with representatives from more than sixty countries speaking. The vast majority of representatives unconditionally supported the concept of complete and thorough disarmament put forward by Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on September 18th this year.

Representatives from Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Western Hemisphere spoke about the recent favorable international situation. They emphasized that agreements must be reached quickly on the most important issues facing humanity. Their speeches showed how concerned the people of the world are about getting rid of the heavy burden of unaffordable military spending and investing these funds in the economic and social development of their own countries.

Soviet delegation leader Kuznetzov, in his speech on the results of the Political Committee's debate, pointed out that, as the debate showed, all the necessary conditions for achieving complete and thorough disarmament now exist, and it is of particular importance and urgency at present. Kuznetzov said that the Soviet proposals received good evaluations from the majority of representatives, and the joint proposal received enthusiastic support from the UN member states. He pointed out that agreement had been reached in principle on the main aspect of the issue – the concept of complete and thorough disarmament – as evidenced by the unanimously adopted proposal. Kuznetzov expressed the hope that the Soviet proposals would be adopted as the working basis for the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee, which should promptly formulate corresponding international agreements on disarmament issues.

Subsequently, the Political Committee unanimously adopted the Soviet and U.S. proposal on complete and thorough disarmament without a vote, which all UN delegations had agreed to as joint sponsors a few days earlier.

    联大政委会一致通过苏美联合提案
    苏联裁军建议深入人心
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会2日晚间结束了对苏联政府关于全面和彻底裁军的建议的讨论，并且一致通过了苏美联合提案。
    这项议程一共讨论了三个星期，发言的有六十多个国家的代表。其中绝大多数的代表都无条件地支持苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫今年9月18日在联合国大会发表的演说中提出的关于全面和彻底裁军的观念。
    欧洲、亚洲、非洲和西半球各国的代表都谈到最近出现的有利的国际形势。他们强调指出，必须在人类最重大的问题上迅速达成协议。他们的发言表明，全世界的人民多么关心摆脱难以担负的军费重担和把这些费用投在本国的经济发展和社会发展上。
    苏联代表团团长库兹?佐夫在发言谈到政治委员会这次辩论的结果时指出，像辩论所表明的，实现全面和彻底裁军现在具备一切必要条件，并且在目前具有特别的重要性和迫切性。库兹?佐夫说，苏联的建议得到了大多数代表良好的评价，联合提案得到了联合国会员国的热烈支持。他指出，在这个问题的主要方面——全面和彻底裁军的观念——已经原则上达成了协议，一致赞同的提案证明了这一点。库兹?佐夫表示希望，苏联的建议将被采取作为十国裁军委员会的工作基础，这个委员会应该从速就裁军问题拟定相应的国际协议。
    接着，政治委员会没有经过投票一致通过了苏联和美国关于全面和彻底裁军问题的提案，在几天前联合国所有代表团都作为联合提案人同意了这个提案。
