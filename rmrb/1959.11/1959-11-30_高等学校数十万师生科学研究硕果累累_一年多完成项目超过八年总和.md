Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch: Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, teachers and students in colleges and universities across the country, combining teaching and productive labor, have launched a mass upsurge in vigorously engaging in scientific research and fiercely attacking cutting-edge technology, achieving brilliant results in a short period of just over a year.

Since the educational revolution of 1958, tens of thousands of teachers and hundreds of thousands of students in colleges and universities across the country have actively and enthusiastically participated in scientific research work, completing scientific research projects far exceeding the total of the eight years from 1949 to 1957. The content of scientific research is very broad, including a large number of large and small topics proposed from production practice, as well as research into many emerging science and technologies and experiments and discussions on basic theories. The quality of scientific research exceeds any previous year. This year, the scientific research work of various colleges and universities has further developed and improved on the basis of last year's great leap forward. According to Tsinghua University's statistics in October, teachers and students across the university completed more than 1,200 scientific and technological research projects in a year and a half, and published and wrote 800 scientific papers and technical materials. Among them, there were 207 last year, and the remaining more than 600 have been completed or are about to be completed this year. This total is equivalent to more than five times the total number of papers published by Tsinghua University's School of Engineering from its establishment to 1949 over the course of seventeen years. From last year to the first half of this year, Peking University completed more than 3,400 scientific research projects. The quantity exceeds the total of the past six years, and the quality has also significantly exceeded the previous level. Harbin Institute of Technology has completed 354 scientific research projects in the past year, surpassing the results of the past several years. From June last year to September this year, Fudan University completed 526 relatively important scientific research projects, of which 224 were to complete national tasks or solve practical problems in production and construction, and 186 reached a higher level. Other new and old colleges and universities have also made great achievements in scientific research, with significant increases and improvements in both quantity and quality compared to any previous year in their respective institutions.

After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, colleges and universities across the country launched a high tide of anti-rightist and encouraging enthusiasm, and a new leap forward situation emerged in scientific research work. For example, Shanghai's colleges and universities completed 1,144 scientific research projects in August and September, more than double the total number of scientific research projects planned to be completed before National Day (400 projects). Among them, 152 key projects with higher appraised quality have also increased compared to the originally planned 121 key projects. The natural science research projects proposed by teachers and students of Beijing Normal University increased from 160 to 314, and the teachers and senior students participating in research work increased from more than 50 percent to more than 90 percent.

In the past year, scientific research work in colleges and universities has been carried out in combination with teaching and productive labor. Whether it is agricultural, engineering, normal, or medical colleges, teachers and students have combined their majors to establish factories and farms in their schools or go to the mountains, the countryside, and factories, engaging in scientific research while working. Therefore, the vast number of teachers and students not only received the necessary tempering of productive labor, but also enriched the teaching content and improved the quality of teaching through the results obtained from carrying out scientific research activities related to teaching. For example, during their work and training in the countryside, teachers and students of Henan Agricultural College conducted 379 scientific research projects in light of problems in production, combining their majors, and wrote 72 valuable scientific papers and 1,002 technical materials, which greatly enriched the teaching content and comprehensively improved the quality of teaching. Similar achievements are common in various schools.

In the past year, most of the scientific research projects in colleges and universities have directly served production. For major directional technical issues in production, various schools have concentrated greater efforts on research. In the mechanical field, the design of various program-controlled machine tools, the finalized design research of soil machine tools suitable for rural use, the development of new welding processes and equipment such as electroslag welding, and the promotion and application of ductile iron; low-temperature dry distillation in the petroleum industry; the manufacturing research of hydraulic coal mining machinery in coal mining; exploration design and research work carried out in coordination with large, medium, and small water conservancy projects in water conservancy; and summarizing the experience of mass high-yield and the application of the "Eight-Character Charter" in agriculture. These research works have achieved great results and made certain contributions to solving the scientific and technological problems in the country's production and construction and promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production.

Extensive cooperation inside and outside the school is a successful experience for colleges and universities in carrying out scientific research. In the past year, most schools have established cooperative relationships with factories, mines, enterprises, people's communes, scientific research institutions in various regions, and fraternal schools; various departments within the school and various teaching and research groups within the department have also generally achieved mutual cooperation, providing mutual support and cooperation in terms of manpower, material resources, and equipment. In the process of carrying out scientific research in combination with teaching, Harbin Institute of Technology has successively conducted large-scale cooperation with fifteen provinces, more than a hundred counties and cities, and 547 factories and mines, on the one hand, directly solving major technical problems in production for production units and promoting production, and on the other hand, improving teaching quality and promoting scientific research work. Many schools have solved specific problems in equipment, materials, and manpower for carrying out scientific research through factory-school cooperation, and have found effective ways to combine teaching and scientific research with practice and productive labor.

The Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for the great achievements in scientific research in colleges and universities. Under the leadership of the Party, colleges and universities across the country opposed the expert line in scientific research work, adhered to the correct line of combining experts with the masses, broke the situation of scientific research being monopolized by a few people, cold and deserted, and divorced from reality, and formed a magnificent mass upsurge in vigorously engaging in scientific research. A few teachers in the Chemistry Department of Nankai University began to conduct research on organophosphorus compounds in 1956, but the methods were not correct and the direction was not clear, and the results were not significant for several years. Last year, the mass line method of the Party was implemented, mobilizing the masses, mobilizing potential research forces, and organizing the personnel who originally participated in this research work to establish a scientific research collective. The work immediately improved greatly, and thirty kinds of organophosphorus compounds with complete data were produced in one year. Secondly, the Party's call to eliminate superstition and liberate thought prepared the ideological foundation for carrying out mass scientific research and encouraged the masses to boldly create and invent. For example, the alternating current calculation table, one of the important equipment necessary for the power system research laboratory of the Electrical Engineering Department of Tsinghua University, only thought of ordering from abroad in the past, but failed to purchase it for four years. Last year, more than 200 teaching assistants, students, and workers broke superstition and did it themselves, and successfully trial-produced it in two months, with a cost of only one-fifth of that of ordering from abroad. The Party's general line and the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor" have shown a broad prospect for the scientific research work of colleges and universities, guiding the scientific research of colleges and universities to advance in the correct direction!

    高等学校数十万师生科学研究硕果累累
    一年多完成项目超过八年总和
    据新华社29日讯　全国高等学校师生，在各级党委领导下，结合教学和生产劳动，掀起了一个群众性的大搞科学研究、猛攻尖端技术的热潮，在短短一年多的时间中取得了辉煌的成果。
    从1958年教育大革命以来，全国高等学校数万教师和几十万学生，积极热情地参加了科学研究工作，完成的科学研究项目，远远超过1949年到1957年八年的总和。科学研究的内容十分广泛，既有大量从生产实际中提出的大、小课题，也有很多新兴的科学技术的研究和基本理论的试验与探讨。科学研究质量超过以往任何一年。今年各高等学校的科学研究工作，在去年跃进的基础上又有进一步的发展和提高。据清华大学10月份的统计，全校师生在一年半的时间内，完成了一千二百多项科学技术研究工作，发表和写出的科学论文和技术资料达八百篇之多。其中去年的有二百零七篇，其余六百多篇都是今年已经完成或即将完成的。这个总数相当于清华大学工学院成立到1949年十七年间发表的论文总和的五倍多。北京大学从去年到今年上半年，共完成科学研究项目三千四百多项。数量超过过去六年的总和，质量也显著地超过了过去的水平。哈尔滨工业大学一年来完成科学研究三百五十四项，胜过以往好几年。复旦大学从去年6月到今年9月，全校共完成较重要的科学研究项目有五百二十六项，其中有二百二十四项是完成国家任务或解决生产建设中实际问题的，有一百八十六项达到了较高水平。其他许多新老院校的科学研究工作，也都取得很大的成绩，无论数量或质量都比本校过去任何一年有显著增加和提高。
    全国高等学校在党的八届八中全会之后，掀起了反右倾、鼓干劲的高潮，科学研究工作又出现了新的跃进的局面。如上海市高等学校8、9两月完成科学研究一千一百四十四项，超过国庆前计划完成的科学研究项目总数（四百项）的一倍以上。其中经过鉴定质量较高的重点项目一百五十二项，也比原定完成的重点项目一百二十一项有所增加。北京师范大学师生提出的自然科学研究项目，由一百六十项增加到三百一十四项，参加研究工作的教师和高年级学生由百分之五十几增加到90％以上。
    一年来，高等学校的科学研究工作，是和教学、生产劳动相结合进行的。无论农科、工科、师范、医药等院校师生，都结合专业在本校兴办工厂、农场或上山、下乡、下厂，一面劳动，一面开展科学研究。因此广大师生不仅得到了必要的生产劳动的锻炼，而且通过开展与教学有关的科学研究活动所取得的成果，丰富了教学内容，提高了教学质量。如河南农学院师生在下放农村劳动锻炼期间，针对生产中的问题，结合专业进行了三百七十九项科学研究，写出了有价值的科学论文七十二篇和技术资料一千零二种，大大丰富了教学内容，全面提高了教学质量。类似这样的成绩，各校都很普遍。
    一年来，高等学校的科学研究项目，大部分是直接为生产服务的。对于生产中重大方向性的技术问题，各校都集中了较大力量进行研究。机械方面，各种程序控制机床的设计、适合农村用土机床的定型设计研究、电渣焊等新的焊接工艺及其设备的发展、球墨铸铁的推广应用等；石油工业方面的低温干馏；采煤方面的水力采煤机械的制造研究；水利方面配合大中小型水利工程所进行的勘探设计和研究工作；以及农业方面总结群众丰产经验、“八字宪法”的运用等等。这些研究工作都取得了较大成绩，对解决国家生产建设中的科学技术问题，促进工农业生产发展，作出了一定贡献。
    校内外大搞协作，是高等学校开展科学研究的成功经验。一年来，大部分学校都与厂矿企业、人民公社、各地科学研究机构以及兄弟学校建立了协作关系；校内各系、系内各教研组也普遍做到相互协作，从人力、物力、设备各方面互相支援合作。哈尔滨工业大学在结合教学开展科学研究工作过程中，先后与十五个省、百多个县市、五百四十七个厂矿进行了大面积协作，一方面直接为生产单位解决生产中的重大技术问题，促进了生产，同时也提高了教学质量，推动了科学研究工作。许多学校通过厂校协作，为开展科学研究解决了设备、材料、人力等方面的具体问题，找到了教学和科学研究联系实际以及与生产劳动三结合的有效途径。
    党的领导是高等学校科学研究工作获得巨大成绩的根本保证。在党的领导下，全国高等学校反对了科学研究工作中的专家路线，坚持了专家与群众相结合的正确路线，打破了科学研究由少数人垄断、冷冷清清、脱离实际的局面，形成了一个规模壮阔的群众性的大搞科学研究的热潮。南开大学化学系少数教师从1956年开始，就对有机磷化合物进行研究，但方法不对头，方向不明确，几年来成绩不显著。去年贯彻党的群众路线工作方法，发动群众，调动潜在研究力量，并把原来参加这一研究工作的人员组织起来，建立科学研究集体，工作立即大有起色，一年中就制成了数据完备的有机磷化合物三十种。其次，党的破除迷信、解放思想的号召，为开展群众性的科学研究准备了思想基础，鼓励了广大群众大胆创造发明的劲头。如清华大学电机系的电力系统研究实验室所必需的重要设备之一交流计算台，过去只想着向国外订货，但四年未能购到。去年二百多助教、学生和工人破除迷信，自己动手，在两个月的时间内就试制成功了，成本仅为国外订货的五分之一。党的总路线和党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，更为高等学校的科学研究工作展示了广阔的前景，它指引着高等学校的科学研究向正确的方向前进！
