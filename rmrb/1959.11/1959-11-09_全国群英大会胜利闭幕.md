    Amidst prolonged and thunderous applause, all representatives unanimously adopted a telegram of salute to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

    Over six thousand representatives unanimously adopted a telegram of salute to the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    Amidst waves of thunderous applause and beautiful music, Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the CPC Central Committee and Premier of the State Council, presented gold-lettered award banners embroidered with "Strive to Build Our Country into a Socialist Country with Modern Industry, Modern Agriculture, and Modern Science and Culture" on red velvet to the various delegations, and shook hands cordially with the representatives receiving the award banners. At this time, all the representatives stood up, applauding thunderously, and the platform and the floor merged into a sea of joy.

    Before the adoption of the telegrams of salute, letters of salute, the letter to workers nationwide, and the awarding of prizes, Young Pioneers from Beijing presented congratulatory messages and flowers to the congress. Amidst a burst of bugle calls, eight hundred Young Pioneers, waving flowers and colored ribbons, entered the venue in thirteen groups. At this time, all the representatives stood up and applauded, expressing a warm welcome to them. A female Young Pioneer stepped onto the rostrum and read a congratulatory message on behalf of 480,000 Young Pioneers in Beijing. She recited: "You brought the good news of stepping into 1960, angering the leisurely Time Old Man; you created new production records, making socialist construction soar like a rocket; you are driving the Great Leap Forward train forward triumphantly, scaring the imperialists into crying and losing their souls." Thunderous applause erupted in the hall. Then, over three hundred children rushed onto the rostrum to present flowers to the heroes.

    Zeng Shan, member of the CPC Central Committee, Minister of the Ministry of Transportation of the CPC Central Committee, and Executive Chairman of the Congress, delivered the closing speech of the congress. In his closing speech, he summarized the achievements of this congress, and hoped that all representatives would publicize the spirit of this congress to the broad masses after returning to their work posts, disseminate the advanced ideas and advanced experiences introduced at the congress, and quickly throw themselves into the intense production battle. Zeng Shan finally warmly congratulated all the representatives on achieving new victories in their work, and congratulated the continuous leap forward and further leap forward in China's socialist construction!
