    The Collective Pig Raising Business is Leaping Forward
    ——An Investigation of Pig Production in the Muyang People's Commune

    The Muyang People's Commune in Suiyang County, Guizhou Province, is a mountainous area that has always been primarily agricultural. In recent years, with the development of production, the number of pigs in this area has gradually increased. After the establishment of the People's Commune in August 1958, the collective pig raising business has developed at a leaping speed. Private pig raising has also developed accordingly. According to statistics at the end of September 1959, the commune raised a total of 73,835 pigs, an increase of 45% compared to 1958. After supporting other areas with 35,000 piglets and transferring 1,156 fattened pigs to the state, there were still 37,679 pigs in stock, averaging 8.9 pigs per household and 1.7 pigs per person. Before the establishment of the commune, collectively raised pigs in agricultural cooperatives accounted for only 6.7% of the total number of pigs in stock, and income only accounted for 4% of the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations. However, in the nine months of 1959, collectively raised pigs accounted for 70% of the total number of pigs in stock, and income accounted for 35.7% of the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations. If calculated for the whole year, the income from collectively raised pigs alone would be 230 yuan per household; while in 1958, the total income from both collectively raised and privately raised pigs was only 210 yuan per household on average.

    The large-scale development of the pig raising industry in the Muyang People's Commune, especially the rapid development of the collectively raised part, can only be achieved by the People's Commune, because:

    First, in terms of funds, the scale of the cooperatives was small in the past, and there were not enough funds to invest heavily in pig raising. The construction of pigsties and the increase in collectively raised pigs mainly relied on state loans. In 1958, the original agricultural cooperatives of this commune borrowed more than 56,000 yuan in pig loans from the state. Now, the People's Commune is large in scale, with concentrated funds, and with the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, public accumulation has increased, and many things can be solved by ourselves. In 1959, the commune invested 120,000 yuan in pig raising, which was three times the investment of 30,000 yuan during the period of advanced cooperatives.

    Second, in terms of feed, the commune established collective canteens, and the by-products of grain processing in the canteens could be used as much as possible to feed publicly owned pigs. The commune also owns 26 factories such as oil pressing, rice milling, and winemaking, and the by-products of these factories, such as oil cakes, rice husks, and distiller's grains, are all good feed for collectively raised pigs. More importantly, the People's Commune established feed bases. In the period of agricultural cooperatives, it was generally difficult to allocate land specifically for planting feed because the cooperative was small and had little land. In 1959, the commune allocated 952 mu of land suitable for planting feed as a feed base for collectively raised pigs, and intercropped feed in 10,000 mu of wheat and rapeseed fields. The commune also has the strength to assign dedicated personnel to regularly collect wild feed and store a large amount of dry feed for the winter. Due to the commune's large-scale operation of canteens and the adjustment of interspersed land, a large amount of labor force has been freed up, making it possible to assign more than 1,100 people to specialize in feeding collectively raised pigs and managing feed production.

    Third, in terms of business management, although the masses had a lot of pig raising experience and adopted some new technologies in the period of agricultural cooperatives, it was often not easy to promote them. For example, the district committee vigorously promoted the use of corn cobs to feed pigs in the past, but it has not been well promoted. However, in the collective farms of the commune, this method was quickly implemented. With dedicated personnel responsible for pig raising, reasonable fixed remuneration for breeders, the establishment of a reward and punishment system, and the formulation of operating procedures for various feeding management, the responsibility and feeding skills of the breeders have been improved. For example, model breeder Yang Yuting used to feed more than ten pigs alone, but now he feeds 72 pigs. In the winter of 1958, the Daya Management District had a total of 180 breeders, feeding 3,000 pigs, but now 152 people feed more than 5,000 pigs, saving a lot of labor compared to private pig raising. In terms of technical management, the commune allocated more than 40,000 yuan specifically to purchase excellent breeds. Now, most of the sows and breeding boars meet the requirements, and 95% of the original inferior breeds have been eliminated. At the same time, epidemic prevention work has been strengthened. In the past, only a few thousand pigs were vaccinated. In 1959, the commune organized 42 veterinarians and 72 epidemic prevention workers to conduct two surprise vaccinations, so that 95% of the public and private pigs were vaccinated. In addition, 25 veterinary clinics have been established throughout the commune, equipped with better medical equipment. In the past six months, diseases such as swine fever and swine erysipelas have been eliminated, the mortality rate has been reduced to 0.3%, and the full pregnancy rate of sows has risen to 90.85%.

    Fourth, the People's Commune can also scientifically and reasonably distribute and build pigsties, so that pig raising production can better promote the development of agriculture and sideline production. In the past, private pig raising was the main form, and private pigsties were in each household, making it very inconvenient to make and apply fertilizer. After the establishment of the commune, pigsties were rationally distributed according to the conditions of farmland fertilization and the distance of feed. For example, a thousand-head pig farm built by the commune is located at the head of the paddy field of the Red Star Team. Its fertilizer can flow directly to the nearby high-yield fields through the self-flowing irrigation system, reducing a lot of labor for transporting fertilizer. The pigsties are also very close to power stations, rice mills, and oil pressing factories. In the future, the electricity from this power station can be used to modernize the pig farms, and the by-products of these processing plants can be used as feed for pig raising. Another example is the Yumin Production Team, which was previously divided into three agricultural cooperatives: Yumin, Xintian, and Yushan. Among them, the Yushan cooperative was located in the high mountains, with more land and less cultivated land, and sufficient feed, but raised few pigs, and many feeds such as bean leaves rotted in the fields. The Yumin and Xintian cooperatives at the foot of the mountain had many pigs and sufficient fertilizer, but it was difficult to develop further due to the lack of feed. After the establishment of the commune, these three cooperatives merged into one accounting unit, and the team built the collective circle in the Yushan Squad, and moved more than 300 publicly raised pigs there for feeding. As a result, both the mountain and the foot of the mountain benefited. Due to the increase in pig manure, the Yushan Squad harvested 380,000 jin of grain in 1959, a full double increase compared to 190,000 jin in 1958. Due to the rational distribution of pigsties, the Daya Management District alone has 20% of the cultivated land, which is far away from the land, and the distant soil has received sufficient fertilizer, and the labor for long-distance fertilizer transportation has been reduced, saving 12,000 labor force a year.

    Fifth, the People's Commune can better strengthen leadership and incorporate the pig raising business into the national plan. After the establishment of the People's Commune, due to the integration of government and commune, the number of cadres has increased compared to the past. The commune party committee has assigned three party committee members to specifically lead the pig raising work and established an office. In each production team, in addition to the core party leadership overseeing this work, full-time cadres have also been assigned, thus ensuring the normal leadership of pig production.

    After the party's leadership was strengthened, pig production was gradually incorporated into the national plan. In the past, influenced by market prices, the masses only raised sows and did not raise fattened pigs, and the state often failed to complete the task of transferring fattened pigs. Now, the commune makes unified plans according to the tasks assigned by the state and develops pigs proportionally. In 1959, the number of fattened pigs transferred to the state increased to 1,600, but by the end of September, in addition to transferring 1,156 fattened pigs, there were still 3,325 fattened pigs in stock and 10,687 half-grown pigs, and the annual transfer task can be overfulfilled.

    In order to better develop the production of collectively raised pigs, the existing 900 collective pigsties in the Muyang Commune will be divided into 32 pig farms, with roughly one pig farm for each production team. In addition, the commune and management district levels will also directly operate several pig farms. The feed base will be expanded to 2,500 mu, with each pig farm having 50 to 150 mu of feed land. In each pig farm, four professional teams will be established (sow breeding team, feed collection team, feed planting and processing team, and breeding team). These teams will carry out technical innovations in the context of division of labor and specialization, and gradually modernize breeding management.

    集体养猪事业在飞跃
    ——募阳人民公社生猪生产调查
    贵州绥阳县募阳人民公社是个山区，一向以农业为主。几年来，这个地区随着生产的发展，猪逐渐增多；1958年8月组成人民公社以后，集体养猪事业以飞跃的速度发展着。私养猪也得到相应的发展。据1959年9月底统计，全社共养猪七万三千八百三十五头，比1958年增长45％，其中除支援外地仔猪三万五千头和上调肥猪一千一百五十六头以外，尚有存栏猪三万七千六百七十九头，每户平均八点九头，每人平均一点七头。在公社建立前，农业社公养猪只占存栏猪总数的6.7％，收入只占农副业总收入的4％。但是在1959年9个月中，公养部分占了存栏猪总数的70％，收入占农副业总收入35.7％。如果按全年预计，仅公养猪的收入，每户就可分到二百三十元；而1958年全年公养、私养两项收入合计，平均每户才分得二百一十元。
    募阳人民公社养猪业大发展，尤其是公养部分发展这样快，这只有人民公社才能够办得到，因为：
    第一、资金方面，过去合作社规模小，资金少，不能大力投资养猪，要盖猪圈和增加公养猪，主要靠国家贷款。1958年，这个公社原来的各个农业社向国家借的生猪贷款就有五万六千多元。现在，人民公社规模大，资金集中，加上农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展，公共积累增多，很多事都可以自己动手解决。1959年，公社投资的养猪款就有十二万元，比高级社时期投资数三万元增加三倍。
    第二、饲料方面，公社成立了集体食堂，食堂的粮食加工副产品就可尽量用来喂养公有猪。公社还拥有榨油、碾米、酿酒等二十六个工厂，这些工厂的副产品如油饼、糠壳、酒糟等都是公养猪的好饲料。更重要的是，人民公社建立了饲料基地。在农业社时期，因为社小土地少，一般很难划出土地专种饲料。1959年公社划出适宜于种饲料的九百五十二亩地作为公养猪的饲料基地，同时在一万亩小麦、油菜地里套种饲料。公社还有力量抽专人经常采集野生饲料，储备了大量的干储饲料过冬。由于公社大办食堂、调整插花地等，腾出了大量的劳动力，这就有可能抽出一千一百多人专门喂养公养猪和经营饲料生产。
    第三、经营管理方面，在农业社时期，群众虽然也有很多养猪经验，也采用过一些新技术，但往往不容易推广。例如，区委过去大力提倡用玉米芯喂猪，一直没能很好推广。但在公社的集体饲养场里，这项办法很快就实行了。由于有专人负责养猪，合理地固定了饲养员的报酬，制定了奖惩制度，规定了各项饲养管理的操作规程，提高了饲养员的责任心和饲养技术。例如，模范饲养员杨玉廷，过去一人喂猪十多头，现在喂猪七十二头。1958年冬天，大垭管理区共有一百八十个饲养员，喂三千头猪，现在一百五十二人，却喂了五千多头，比私人养猪节省了大量的劳动力。在技术管理方面，公社拨出四万多元专款来选购优良品种，现在，大部分母猪和种公猪都合乎要求，原有的劣种95％都已淘汰。同时，加强了防疫工作，过去防疫注射的猪只有几千头，1959年，公社组织了四十二个兽医和七十二个防疫员进行了两次突击注射，使95％的公、私猪都打了防疫针。另外，全社还成立了二十五个兽医室，配备了较好的医药器械。近半年来，已消灭了猪瘟、猪丹毒等病疫，死亡率已降低到0.3％，母猪满怀率已上升到90.85％。
    第四、人民公社还可以科学地、合理地分布和修建猪圈，使养猪生产更好地促进农、副业生产的发展。过去以私养为主，私人的猪圈都在各家各户，制肥、施肥很不方便。建立公社后，按照农田用肥、饲料远近等条件合理分布猪圈。如公社修盖的一座千头养猪场，就建在红星队的水田头上，它的肥料通过自流灌溉系统，可以直接流到附近丰产田里，减少了大量的运肥劳动力。猪圈还和发电站、碾米厂、榨油厂很接近，今后可以用这个电站的电力使养猪场更加现代化，而这些加工厂的副产品就可以作为养猪的饲料。又如裕民生产队，过去分为裕民、新田、裕山三个农业社，其中裕山社地处高山，地多田少，饲料充足，但养的猪少，很多饲料如豆叶等都烂在地里。山下的裕民、新田社猪多肥足，但由于饲料缺乏，再发展就有困难。公社成立后，这三个社合成一个核算单位，队里便把集体圈盖在裕山小队，把三百多只公养猪移到那里饲养。结果，山上、山下都有好处。裕山小队由于猪粪增加，1959年收粮食三十八万斤，比1958年的十九万斤增加整整一倍。由于合理分布猪圈，仅大垭管理区就有占耕地面积20％的远田、远土得到了充分的肥料，而且减少了长途运肥劳力，一年可节省一万二千个劳动力。
    第五、人民公社能更好地加强领导，使养猪事业纳入国家计划。人民公社成立以后，由于政社合一，干部比过去增多，公社党委抽出三个党委委员专门领导养猪工作，并成立了办公室。在各个生产队中，除党的领导骨干兼管这项工作外，还配备了专职干部，这样就保证了生猪生产的正常领导。
    党的领导加强以后，生猪生产便逐步纳入国家计划。过去，群众受市场价格的影响，只养母猪，不养肥猪，国家上调肥猪的任务经常完不成。现在，公社根据国家下达的任务统一规划，按比例发展生猪。1959年，上调肥猪的任务数增加到一千六百头，但是到9月底，除上调肥猪一千一百五十六头外，尚有存栏肥猪三千三百二十五头，架子猪一万零六百八十七头，全年的上调任务可以超额完成。
    为了更好地发展公养猪的生产，募阳公社现有的九百多间集体猪圈，将划分成三十二个养猪场，大体上每个生产队有一个养猪场。另外，公社和管理区两级还将直接经营几个养猪场。饲料基地将扩大为二千五百亩，每个养猪场将有五十亩到一百五十亩饲料地。在每个养猪场内，将成立四个专业队（母猪饲养专业队、饲料采集专业队、饲料种植加工专业队和饲养队），这些队将在分工分业的情况下大搞技术革新，使饲养管理逐步走向现代化。
