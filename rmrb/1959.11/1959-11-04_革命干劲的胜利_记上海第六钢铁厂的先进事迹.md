The Victory of Revolutionary Zeal
    ——A Record of the Advanced Deeds of the Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant

In the western part of Shanghai, close to the Suzhou Creek, there is a small steel plant called the Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant. Although this plant is small and the conditions are poor, it has been a red banner on the steelmaking front this year, embodying the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical.

Upon entering this factory, one immediately gets the feeling that it is indeed making do with whatever is available, and the production conditions are quite poor. The main workshop – the converter workshop – is only nine meters wide and six meters high. The cranes seem like tall men living in a low house, barely able to stand upright. Opposite the converter is the pig iron furnace, with the shortest distance between the furnace pit and the converter pit being only 1.5 meters. The factory has a small area and lacks transportation tools. In addition, the supply of raw materials was relatively tight and of poor quality in the first half of this year, so there were many difficulties.

However, upon entering the factory, one also gets another feeling – you will be immediately moved by the workers' selfless labor and enthusiasm for fighting for steel, feeling that they are all ambitious, motivated, intelligent, and fearless heroes. It is these heroes who, under the leadership of the Party organization, displayed soaring enthusiasm and thus, despite the objective existence of many unfavorable conditions, bravely overcame various difficulties on the road forward and created excellent results in production. Since January this year, they have overfulfilled the state plan every month; the steel output from January to September increased by 68% compared with the same period last year; the converter utilization coefficient reached over 23 tons; the steel qualification rate was stable at over 98%; the iron consumption per ton of steel decreased from 1,600 kilograms at the beginning of the year to 1,254 kilograms; the electricity consumption per ton of steel was 33 kilowatt-hours, a decrease of 20% compared with the beginning of the year; and there have been no major personal accidents this year... truly achieving high output, high quality, economy, and safety in an all-round way.

Why has such great achievement been made in production in a factory with such simple equipment and unfavorable objective conditions?

Continuing the Great Leap Forward

At the beginning of this year, some cadres had the following ideas: this year's production tasks are "certain to be completed"; some believed that: "Shanghai has several large factories such as Shanghai No. 1, No. 3, and No. 5 Steel Plants, it doesn't matter whether No. 6 Steel Plant produces steel or not." At this time, the Municipal Party Committee was holding a Party Congress. After studying the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the factory Party Committee realized that if these ideological problems were not resolved, they would hinder this year's continued leap forward. Therefore, starting from January 12, they spent three and a half days holding an enlarged meeting of the factory Party Committee, conveying the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal Party Congress, and summarizing the experience of the factory's Great Leap Forward last year; at the same time, they analyzed the situation of steel production at that time, explaining that in order to complete this year's steelmaking tasks with both quality and quantity, it was necessary to make arduous efforts and maintain sufficient revolutionary enthusiasm. The Party Committee also conducted situational education among the masses, disclosing the tasks and difficulties to the masses, and mobilized the masses to start discussions. Through transmission, debate, and propaganda mobilization, from cadres to the masses, their understanding was improved, and all the employees of the factory unanimously believed that no matter how many difficulties they encountered in production, they must overcome these difficulties and achieve this year's continued leap forward. After the ideas were clarified, all the employees of the factory were eager to give it a try and were full of fighting spirit. The comrades of the material transportation team of the converter workshop said, we guarantee to load enough "grain and grass" to fill the pig iron furnace, let's see if your pig iron furnace can eat it all up. The comrades of the pig iron furnace section said, I'll eat every car that comes, and ask the converter section in turn, I produce iron water quickly and in large quantities, can your converter eat it all up? The comrades of the converter section said, I'll eat every bag that comes, and two bags at a time, and ask the steel casting section in turn if they can cast it all. The comrades of the steel casting section said, I'll cast every furnace that comes, match large molds for large ingots and small molds for small ingots. The slag cleaning workers, the shift maintenance workers, and the furnace repair workers also put forward their guarantees. The personnel of the offices also threw themselves into the intense battle. In this way, the grand opening of the factory's vigorous continuation of the Great Leap Forward was launched. After January 19, the workshop overfulfilled the work plan every day. In just eleven days, it not only made up for the tasks that were missed in the first and middle ten days of the month, but also overfulfilled the January plan.

Breaking Through Three Barriers

When the enthusiasm of the masses is aroused, but on the road of the leap forward, in the struggle between man and nature, it is necessary to constantly break through barriers and solve different major contradictions that arise in different periods in a timely manner.

The first difficulty encountered at the beginning of the year was the high-sulfur native iron barrier. At that time, the raw materials for steelmaking were native iron transported to Shanghai from all over the country. From the beginning of the Great Leap Forward to the beginning of this year, the No. 6 Steel Plant had used native iron from more than 120 local small blast furnaces, and at least 50 local native irons were used every month. The varieties were miscellaneous, and the sulfur content was high, making it difficult to grasp the rules of melting and blowing. It was not only easy to produce defective products, but also often froze the steel ladle and hung the furnace, which increased many difficulties in production and became a primary key to increasing output at that time. Faced with this difficulty, a few cadres and workers said: "How can good steel be made if the sulfur is high? It's just asking for trouble." But most comrades firmly believed that: "Although the sulfur in native iron is high, it is still a treasure for steelmaking," "How can steel production be increased without using native iron?" At this time, the leadership also told the masses about the tasks, shared the difficulties, and mobilized the masses to find solutions, and inspired the masses to discuss whether to stop the furnace and wait, or retreat in the face of difficulties, or overcome the difficulties and achieve a leap forward? After extensive discussions among the masses, it was unanimously believed that the native iron barrier could and must be overcome. They shouted the heroic slogan of "Make high sulfur bow its head, and turn native iron into steel," and the entire factory worked together to fight the battle to overcome the native iron barrier. Old workers took the initiative to go to the material yard to teach new workers, teaching them how to identify native iron and explaining the principles of matching ingredients, so that new workers understood how to ensure quality. In order to reduce the sulfur content of molten iron, the pig iron furnace workers adopted external desulfurization methods, and three shifts carried out a desulfurization effect competition to improve the desulfurization rate. At the same time, the factory leaders drew 150 people from the converter workshop to work on alkaline pig iron furnaces to refine recycled iron. Supply and marketing personnel, regardless of day or night, as soon as they heard that materials had arrived at the station, immediately tried to take samples in advance to test the ingredients. When the iron materials arrived at the factory, the ingredients had already been tested, and they were stacked in batches according to different incoming materials, marked with the ingredients. In addition, the inspectors also went to the furnace to conduct analysis and testing. The workers said: "To fight, we must first scout the enemy's situation. Inspectors are scouts. By figuring out the major sulfur enemy situation, bad materials can be turned into good steel ingots." It was precisely because the masses displayed soaring enthusiasm and collective wisdom that they finally grasped the rules of eating native iron and created many ways to control native iron. The native iron barrier was overcome, the output increased by 21%, and the steel qualification rate reached over 98%. The victory of this battle broke the superstition that good steel cannot be made from native iron and opened up the road for eating native iron.

After the native iron barrier was broken, the problem of whether the converter could eat native iron was solved, but to further increase steel production, it was necessary to eat more, eat faster, and eat better. At this time, new contradictions were encountered, that is, the melting rate of the pig iron furnace was low, and the iron water could not meet the needs of the converter. How to break through the pig iron furnace melting barrier became another key to the continued leap forward in production.

In the campaign to besiege the pig iron furnace, the leaders found that the same pig iron furnace could only produce six tons of iron water per hour in the hands of the C shift, but in the hands of the B shift, it could produce seven or eight tons per hour. When the B shift handed over the furnace to the A shift, the melting rate immediately dropped again. What was the reason for this? After the general branch of the workshop party sent technicians to the workshop to follow the shifts for labor, the mystery was quickly revealed. It turned out that the workers of the B shift, based on the characteristics of native iron and native coke, adopted the method of "thin layer and frequent addition" when adding materials, and the material line was lower than the original operating procedures stipulated. In this way, the furnace temperature was high, and the iron water, of course, came out quickly. The general branch of the workshop party summarized their experience in a timely manner and convened the pig iron furnace workers of the three shifts to discuss and study together, based on the operation method of the B shift, absorbing the advantages of the other two shifts, and revised the original operating procedures in light of the characteristics of native iron and native coke. The melting rate of the pig iron furnace quickly increased from the past seven tons to about ten tons. On this basis, measures were taken to strengthen the blast, so that the seven-ton pig iron furnace could produce more than twelve tons of iron water. The key to the converter's lack of feed was thus solved. The solution of the pig iron furnace melting barrier overcame the weak link in the production leap forward and provided the converter with a sufficient supply of iron water, thus increasing the daily production level by another 12%.

After the difficulty of the low melting rate of the pig iron furnace was broken, the iron water supply was sufficient, and the question was not whether the converter could eat enough, but whether it could eat it all. Because the converter had a short furnace life, it often could only open two furnaces, and sometimes only one furnace, so the weak link in production shifted from the pig iron furnace to the converter. To leap forward, it was necessary to improve the furnace life. Therefore, the workers fully developed the spirit of dauntlessness, worked hard and skillfully, and fiercely attacked the converter furnace life barrier. In order to extend the life of the furnace, the leaders adopted the "one chain" method, mobilizing the masses of each process, especially focusing on improving the quality of the furnace bricks and improving the furnace front operation. The brick workers carefully summarized their brick-making experience, learned from the experience of other factories, and strictly implemented the operating procedures. The bricks produced were not only highly dense, but also very flat on the surface, corners, and edges; competitions were also carried out among the three shifts. They expressed their determination not to let the converter have a short life due to the poor quality of the furnace lining bricks, and requested that the furnace lining bricks made by each shift be stacked and used separately to clarify responsibility, and requested that each brick be quality-checked. The brick workers went to the furnace to see if the furnace made of the bricks they had made was long-lived or not whenever they had time. The furnace repair workers also guaranteed that the furnace life would not be affected due to the poor quality of bricklaying and furnace baking, and took the initiative to propose "contracting the furnace repair" measures, with one shift as a unit, contracting a furnace from beginning to end, competing to see which shift repaired the furnace with a long life. The furnace front workers strictly implemented the operating procedures, strictly mastered the blowing angle, reduced and eliminated "back blowing" and "deep blowing," and measured the wind eyes on time, competing to see who ate less wind eyes. Each shift carried out competitions to see who had a short blowing time, and in the operation, they figured out the experience of "refining the furnace before refining steel," which greatly extended the life of the furnace.

In overcoming the converter furnace life barrier, the workers used their brains and actively offered suggestions. The new converter furnace lining was often not baked well, which affected the service life of the furnace lining, and sometimes even collapsed as soon as it was baked. Xia Acai, an old worker of the A shift, was very anxious. He recalled that no accidents had ever occurred with the furnaces he had handled, so he sorted out his furnace baking experience overnight and handed it over to the leadership for reference. The leadership immediately promoted it in the furnace lining sections of the three shifts, which played a great role. Liu Qiuxian, the furnace repair foreman who was in recuperation, also came up with a good idea in his illness, suggesting that the furnace cover and the furnace body should be built together. After his method was adopted, the drawbacks of the furnace often breaking at the joints were overcome. Because all processes, from roasting refractory materials, transporting and storing refractory materials, making bricks, demolishing furnaces, repairing and building furnace linings, to furnace front smelting operations, took action to fight for extending the furnace life, and because the vast number of employees were full of enthusiasm and exerted infinite wisdom, the converter furnace life barrier was overcome. The breaking of the furnace life barrier made it possible for the workshop to often open three converters, so the daily steel production level could rise more rapidly. The steel output in May reached 9,000 tons, making it the month with the highest monthly output in the past five months.

Never Be Complacent

Difficulties are constantly being overcome, and production is constantly leaping forward. The Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant has made great achievements in the first half of the year. The daily steel output has leaped from 210 tons to 300 tons, and the quality has continued to improve, and the iron consumption has gradually decreased. The leap forward target of 96,000 tons for the whole year proposed at the beginning of the year can already be achieved steadily. Can we continue to leap forward without increasing equipment? Some people believe that it is unlikely to increase by another 50% within the year. Some also believe that the converter utilization coefficient (dead furnace seat) has gradually leaped from 11.68 tons in January to more than 16 tons, reaching the advanced level of the city. It is also unlikely to break through the 20-ton mark within the year, let's talk about it next year!

On August 26, the fighting call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party brought new encouragement to the employees of the entire factory to continue the leap forward. Fighting a big battle in August and September to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China became a mobilization order for the employees of the entire factory. In a few days, big-character posters and letters of determination were plastered all over the walls, and even temporary workers and female labor armies posted big-character posters. The masses enthusiastically responded to the Party's call to further push production to a new climax. The workers of the A shift proposed to increase the annual leap forward target to 103,000 tons, and this proposal was immediately supported by the brother shifts.

Starting from the midnight shift on September 1, the steelmaking workers had a good start, producing high yields for three consecutive days, with an average daily output of more than 50 tons higher than the 300 tons in August. However, after September 4, followed by three days of low production, with daily output below 300 tons. What was the reason for this? It turned out that according to the needs of the country, the higher authorities instructed to refine welding rod steel. Although this kind of steel had been refined in the past, the quantity was small. The workshop could only open two furnaces, and all the technical personnel and the director of the workshop had to put all their efforts into it to barely cope. Now that some of the technical strength has been transferred, it is really difficult to both produce high yields and refine welding rod steel. "High yields cannot be produced by refining welding rod steel." This superstitious thinking shackled people's hands and feet, resulting in three days of low production after three days of high production.

Can welding rod steel really be produced at high yields? The factory Party Committee held a special meeting to discuss it. After the debate, it was recognized that the key lies in the attitude towards difficulties. Therefore, the Party Committee made a resolution: the leap forward plan for September must be completed, and the variety plan for welding rod steel must also be completed. The only way is to resolutely implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, oppose right-leaning conservative thinking, break superstitions, let go of mobilizing the masses, and launch a mass movement. After the cadres clarified their thinking, they went to consult with the masses. Under the inspiration of the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the masses had always been full of enthusiasm, and they had no fear of difficulties. When the workshop cadres saw that the masses were full of confidence, they decided to reopen three converters. After September 7, the daily output really returned to more than 300 tons. The steelmaking workers of the three shifts enthusiastically launched a competition, and the output rose rapidly. The A shift just surpassed the C shift, the B shift surpassed the A shift, and the C shift surpassed the B shift again. Before the first good news was pasted, the second good news was pasted again. The weak link of steel casting also kept up with steelmaking by taking measures. In a few days, the plan for high-quality steel varieties was overfulfilled. The superstitious thinking that high yields cannot be produced by refining high-quality steel was broken.

In late September, the average daily output of steel leaped to 420 tons, and in the first half of October, it leaped to the peak of 450 tons, and the first-class product rate was as high as 83%. The converter utilization coefficient has broken through the 20-ton mark and reached more than 23 tons, exceeding the 20-ton target proposed by Shanghai at the National Steel Production Competition Broadcast Conference. Under the ideological encouragement of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the employees of the entire factory are constantly advancing victoriously, and production is changing rapidly. Originally, some cadres only planned to break through the 10,000-ton mark in monthly output in October, but this plan was realized in advance in September. On September 25, the daily output broke through the 500-ton mark, creating a historical record of 503 tons per day...

    革命干劲的胜利
    ——记上海第六钢铁厂的先进事迹
    在上海市区的西面，紧靠着苏州河边，有个规模不大的钢铁厂，这就是上海第六钢铁厂，别看这个厂小，条件不好，可是今年以来，它却是炼钢战线上一面多快好省的红旗。
    一走进这个厂，就有一种感觉，觉得这个厂的确是因陋就简，生产条件很差。厂的主要车间——转炉车间，宽不过九米，高仅六米，几部行车就好像高个子大汉住在矮屋里，勉勉强强才能够直起腰杆；转炉对面是化铁炉，化铁炉炉坑与转炉炉坑之间，最短距离只有一点五米。全厂场地狭小，运输工具也不足，再加上今年上半年又遇到原材料供应比较紧张，质量也不太好，因此困难很多。
    但是，你一走进厂，也会有另一个感觉，你会立刻被工人那种为钢而战的忘我劳动的热情所感动，觉得他们个个都是有志气、有干劲、有智慧，不怕任何困难的英雄好汉。正是这些英雄们在党组织的领导下发挥了冲天干劲，因而尽管在客观上存在着不少不利条件，可是他们勇敢地克服了前进道路上的各种困难，在生产上创造了优异的成绩。今年1月份以来，他们月月超额完成了国家计划；1至9月的钢产量比去年同期增长了68％；转炉利用系数高达二十三吨以上；钢的合格率稳定在98％以上，每吨钢用铁量从年初一千六百公斤，下降到一千二百五十四公斤；每吨钢用电量为三十三度，比年初下降20％；今年以来没有发生重大人身事故……真正全面地做到了高产、优质、节约和安全。
    为什么在这样一个设备简陋，客观条件并不好的厂，在生产上却取得了这样巨大的成绩呢？
    继续跃进
    今年一开始，在部分干部中有这样一些想法：今年的生产任务“有把握完成”；有的认为：“上海有上钢一厂、三厂、五厂几个大厂，六厂炼不炼都无所谓”。这时，市委正召开党代会，厂党委经过学习六中全会文件，认识到这些思想问题如果不解决，就会妨碍今年的继续跃进。于是，1月12日起，一连花了三个半天的时间，举行厂党委扩大会议，一面传达党的六中全会和市党代会的精神，一面总结去年本厂大跃进的经验；同时，分析了当时钢铁生产的形势，说明要按质按量地完成今年的炼钢任务，必须作艰苦的努力，必须保持充沛的革命干劲。党委会又向群众进行形势教育，把任务和困难向群众交底，并且发动群众展开讨论。通过传达、辩论和宣传鼓动，从干部到群众，都提高了认识，全厂职工一致认为，不论在生产中会遇到多少困难，也一定要克服这些困难，实现今年的继续跃进。思想明确之后，全厂职工个个磨拳擦掌，人人斗志昂扬。转炉车间运料组同志说，我们保证把“粮草”装得足足地让化铁炉吃饱，看你化铁炉能不能吃得光。化铁炉工段的同志说，你来一车我吃一车，反过来问转炉工段，我铁水出得快又多，看你转炉吃得了吃不了？转炉工段的同志说，你来一包我吃一包，来二包我吃一双，反问浇钢工段能否浇得光。浇钢工段的同志说，你来一炉我浇一炉，需要大模就配大模，需要小模就配小模。清渣工、值班检修工、修炉工，也各自提出了保证。科室的人员也都纷纷投入了紧张的战斗。这样，全厂轰轰烈烈继续跃进的序幕就拉开了。在1月19日以后，车间天天超额完成作业计划，短短十一天中，不仅把上旬、中旬脱下的任务补了回来，而且还超额完成了1月份计划。
    连破三关
    群众的干劲起来了，但在跃进的道路上，在人与自然界的斗争中，还必须不断地突破一道道的难关，必须及时地解决在各个时期中出现的各个不同的主要矛盾。
    年初遇到的第一道难关是高硫土铁关。当时炼钢的原材料是全国各地运到上海的土铁。六厂从大跃进开始到年初曾用了一百二十多个地方的小高炉铁，每月最少也要用五十多个地方出产的土铁，品种既杂，含硫量又比较高，使熔化和吹炼的规律很难捉摸，不仅容易出废品，而且经常会冻钢包、挂炉子，给生产增加了不少困难，成为当时提高产量的一个首要关键。在这道难关面前，有少数干部和工人就说：“硫高怎能炼好钢，要炼是自讨苦吃”。但大多数同志却坚决认为：“土铁硫虽高，炼钢还是宝”，“不吃土铁，钢产量怎能提高”。这时领导上也向群众讲任务、摊困难、发动群众想办法，并启发群众讨论，是停炉等待，知难而退，还是克服困难，实现跃进？经过群众的广泛讨论，一致认为土铁关可以攻克也必须攻克，他们豪迈地喊出了“叫高硫低头，要土铁成钢”的口号，全厂上下一致，投入了攻克土铁关的战斗。老工人主动到料场去给新工人上课，教他们识别土铁的方法，讲解搭配成分的道理，使新工人懂得怎样来保证质量。化铁炉工人为了降低铁水含硫，采取了炉外脱硫办法，并且三班开展去硫效果的竞赛，提高去硫率。同时，厂的领导又从转炉车间抽出一百五十多人搞碱性化铁炉，炼再生铁。供销人员不分日夜，一听车站有料到，马上想办法提前取样化验成分，等铁料到厂，成分已经化验出来，就按来料不同情况分批堆放，标明成分。此外，化验员还到炉前进行分析化验。工人们说：“作战先要探敌情，化验员是侦察兵，摸清含硫大敌情，坏料变成好钢锭”。正由于群众发扬了冲天干劲和集体的智慧，终于摸到了吃土铁的规律，创造了许多制服土铁的办法。土铁关被攻下了，产量上升了21％，钢的合格率达到了98％以上。这场战斗的胜利，打破了土铁不能炼好钢的迷信，为吃土铁开辟了道路。
    当土铁关突破以后，转炉能不能吃土铁的问题解决了，但要进一步提高钢产量，还必须吃得多，吃得快，吃得好。这时，又遇到了新的矛盾，这就是化铁炉熔化率低，铁水供不上转炉的需要。如何突破化铁炉熔化关，就成为生产继续跃进的又一关键。
    在发动群众围攻化铁炉的战斗中，领导上发现同样一只化铁炉，在丙班手里每小时只能出六吨铁水，可是到乙班手里，每小时能出到七吨、八吨，乙班把炉子交给甲班，熔化率又马上跌下来。这是什么道理呢？当车间党总支派技术员下车间跟班劳动以后，谜底很快就揭破了。原来乙班工人根据土铁、土焦的特点，在加料时，采取“薄层勤加”的办法，料线要比原来操作规程规定的加得低。这样做，炉温高，铁水当然出得快。车间党总支及时地总结了他们的经验，并且召开三个班的化铁炉工人一起讨论研究，以乙班操作法为基础，吸收了其他两个班的长处，针对土铁土焦的特点，修改了原来的操作规程。化铁炉的熔化率很快地由过去的七吨提高到十吨左右。在此基础上，又采取了强化鼓风的措施，使七吨的化铁炉可以出十二吨以上的铁水。转炉吃不饱的关键从此就解决了。化铁炉熔化关的解决，克服了生产跃进中的薄弱环节，使转炉有足够的铁水供应，因而使日产水平又提高了12％。
    当化铁炉熔化率低的难关被突破以后，铁水供应充足，就不是转炉能否吃得饱，而是能否吃得了的问题了。由于转炉炉龄短，经常只能开两个炉子，有时只能开一个炉子，因此生产
  中的薄弱环节由化铁炉转移到转炉上来。要跃进，就必须提高炉龄。于是，职工群众又充分发扬了大无畏精神，苦干加巧干，猛攻转炉炉龄关。为了延长炉子寿命，领导上采取了“一根链条”的办法，把各个工序的群众都发动起来，特别是着重提高炉砖的质量和改进炉前操作。制砖工人认真地总结了自己制砖经验，学习了别厂的经验，严格地执行操作规程，制成的砖不但细密度高，而且面、角、边都十分平整；在三班之间也开展了竞赛。他们表示决心不让转炉因为炉衬砖的质量不好而寿命短，要求把各班打的炉衬砖分别堆放，分别使用，以明责任，并要求对每块砖都进行质量检验。制砖工人们一有空就奔到炉子上去看自己打的砖头砌成的炉子长寿不长寿。修炉工人也保证不因砌砖烘炉质量不好而影响炉龄，主动地提出“包修炉子”的措施，以一个班为单位，从头到尾包修一只炉子，比赛哪一个班修的炉子寿命长。炉前工人严格执行操作规程，严格掌握吹炼角度，减少和消灭“后吹”、“深吹”，按时测量风眼，看谁吃风眼吃得少，各班开展竞赛，看谁吹炼时间短，在操作中摸出了“炼钢先炼炉”的经验，大大地延长了炉子的寿命。
    在攻克转炉炉龄关中，工人们个个开动脑筋，积极地献计献策。转炉新砌炉衬常常烘得不好，影响炉衬使用寿命，有时甚至一烘就垮。甲班老工人夏阿才心中很急，他回想了一下，凡是自己经手的炉子从来没有出过事故，就连夜整理出一份烘炉的经验交给领导参考，领导上立即在三个班的炉衬工段里推广，起了很大作用。正在疗养中的修炉工长刘秋贤，也在病中想出了一条妙计，建议把炉盖和炉身合在一起砌炉，采取他的办法后，就克服了炉子经常坏在接缝处的弊病。由于从焙烧耐火材料、运输和保管耐火材料、制砖、拆炉、修砌炉衬、烘烤炉壳到炉前冶炼操作等各个工序都行动起来，为延长炉龄而斗争，由于广大职工群众个个干劲冲天，发挥无穷的智慧，因此转炉炉龄关就被攻下来了。炉龄关的攻破使得车间里有可能经常开三只转炉，这样钢的日产水平就能更加迅速上升。5月份的钢产量达到了九千吨，成为五个月以来月产量最高的一个月。
    永不自满
    难关不断地被攻破，生产也不断地向前跃进，上钢六厂上半年的生产取得了很大成绩，钢的日产量从二百一十吨跃进到三百吨，而且质量不断提高，铁耗逐步下降，年初提出的全年九万六千吨的跃进指标已经可以稳拿到手了。在不增加设备的情况下，能不能继续飞跃前进呢？有人认为：在年内再增长50％是不大可能的了。也有人认为：转炉利用系数（死炉座）已经从1月份的十一点六八吨逐步跃进到十六吨以上，达到了市的先进水平，要在年内闯过二十吨大关，也是不大可能的了，还是来年再说吧！
    8月26日，党的八届八中全会的战斗号召给全厂职工带来了新的继续跃进的鼓舞力量。大战8、9月，迎接建国十周年，成为全厂职工的动员令。几天之间，大字报、决心书就贴满了所有的墙壁，连临时工、妇女劳动大军也都纷纷贴出了大字报。群众热烈地响应党的号召，要把生产进一步推向新的高潮。甲班工人提出倡议，把全年跃进指标提高到十万三千吨，这个倡议立即得到兄弟班的一致拥护。
    从9月1日的零点班开始，炼钢工人就旗开得胜，连续三天高产，平均日产量比8月份的三百吨增加了五十多吨。但是，9月4日以后，紧接着是三天低产，日产量都低于三百吨。这是什么道理呢？原来根据国家的需要，上级指示要炼电焊条钢。过去虽然炼过这种钢，但数量很少，车间里只能开两只炉子，而且技术人员、车间主任等全部力量投上去，才能勉强对付。现在技术力量又被抽调了一些，要既高产又炼电焊条钢，实在很难。“炼电焊条钢就不能高产。”这个迷信思想束缚了人们的手脚，在三天高产之后又造成了三天低产。
    电焊条钢到底能不能高产？厂党委召开了专门会议，进行讨论，经过争辩，认识到关键还是在于对待困难的态度。因此党委做出决议：9月份的跃进计划一定要完成，电焊条钢的品种计划也一定要完成，唯一的办法是坚决贯彻党的八届八中全会的精神，反对右倾保守思想，打破迷信，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动。干部思想明确之后，就去和群众商量。群众在党的八届八中全会的号召的鼓舞下，始终干劲很足，他们丝毫没有畏难情绪。车间干部一见群众信心很足，因此决定重新开起三只转炉。9月7日以后，日产量果然又回升到三百吨以上。三班炼钢工人热烈地展开了竞赛，产量迅速上升。甲班刚超过丙班，乙班又超过甲班，丙班再超过乙班，前一张喜报浆糊未干，第二张喜报又贴上去了。浇钢的薄弱环节由于采取了措施，也跟上了炼钢。不几天，优质钢品种的计划就超额完成。炼优质钢不能高产的迷信思想被打破了。
    9月下旬，钢的平均日产量飞跃到四百二十吨，10月上半月再跃上了四百五十吨的高峰，而且一级品率也高达83％。转炉利用系数已经突破了二十吨关，达到二十三吨以上，超过了上海在全国钢铁生产竞赛广播大会上所提出的二十吨的指标。在党的八届八中全会的思想鼓舞下，全厂职工不断地乘胜前进，生产日新月异。本来有些干部只打算在10月份来一个月产量突破万吨关，结果这个打算在9月份就提前实现，9月25日日产量更突破了五百吨大关，创造了日产五百零三吨的历史纪录……
