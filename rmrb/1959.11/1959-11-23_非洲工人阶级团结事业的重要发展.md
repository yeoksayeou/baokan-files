An important development in the cause of unity of the African working class

From November 5th to 10th, the African Trade Union Conference was held in Accra, the capital of Ghana. The meeting decided to establish the Preparatory Committee of the All-African Trade Union Federation, composed of 19 members including Ghana, Guinea, Morocco, Algeria, Nigeria, Tunisia, Uganda and other African countries. The headquarters of the committee is located in Accra. The meeting decided to convene the African Trade Union Congress in Casablanca, Morocco in May 1960. This is an important event in the African labor movement.

The convening of the African Trade Union Conference was the result of a period of brewing. The All-African People’s Conference held last December proposed to all African people that, in order to liberate Africa from the shackles of colonialism and imperialism, the people of all African countries must organize a broad anti-imperialist united front. Under the impetus of the All-African People's Conference, the Ghana and Nigeria Trade Union Congress held a joint meeting in August this year. Both sides agreed to establish the West African Trade Union Federation, which includes all English, French and Portuguese speaking regions in West Africa. In September this year, representatives from the Moroccan Labor Union, the General Federation of Black African Workers, the General Federation of Algerian Workers, and the Arab Trade Union International Federation held a meeting in Casablanca to discuss the preparations for the African Trade Union Congress. This recent meeting has further specified the convening of the African Trade Union Congress.

The conference clearly put forward anti-imperialist political propositions: The declaration of the conference stated that the All-African Trade Union Federation serves the cause of African independence and freedom, and its basic goal is "the liberation and unification of Africa." The program of action adopted by the conference stated that colonial rule has caused division, backwardness, poverty, and discrimination in Africa, and the representatives pledged to wage fearless and self-sacrificing struggles for the political and economic liberation of the African continent. The program also said: "Colonial countries such as Belgium, Portugal, Spain, France, and Britain have established racial discrimination as a system. The African market continues to be dominated by foreign capitalism. The bloody and unjust war against the Algerian people is underway, and the people of Kenya, Cameroon, the Belgian Congo, Nyasaland, and Uganda are suffering the most unenlightened and inhuman suppression." "The representatives will fulfill their duties to support the struggles of our brothers in Cameroon, Kenya, Congo, Nyasaland, Gambia, Uganda, and the French Community for national independence." The conference also expressed the All-African Trade Union Federation's desire to widely unite all African workers. The declaration stated: "The All-African Trade Union Federation opens its doors to all African trade union organizations, regardless of whether they participate in any international trade union organization, and it respects the autonomy of trade unions in African countries." The conference also stated that the All-African Trade Union Federation is a "positively neutral federation" that does not participate in international trade union organizations, but is friendly to all international organizations. "It will also strive to establish cooperation with all national and international central trade union organizations." Morocco's "Liberation Daily" commented on the convening of the conference and the upcoming establishment of the All-African Trade Union Federation, saying: This conference is the most important event in the history of African unity, and the All-African Trade Union Federation will enable the African working class to fight against exploitation on this continent, enabling them to master the best means to fight for liberation.

Precisely because this African Trade Union Conference has relatively obvious anti-imperialist and unified unity characteristics, it has aroused great anxiety among imperialists and their agents. While the Accra conference was being held, under the planning of imperialism, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions also hastily staged a farce of an "African Trade Union Conference" in Lagos, Nigeria. Its purpose was to attempt to split the African labor movement, sing a rival show against the Accra conference, and dismantle the All-African Trade Union Federation that was being prepared. Gogochi Nigerilib, a well-known trade union worker in Nigeria, commented on this in the "Ghana Worker's Daily": "The upper leadership of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, its actions in Africa under the protection of the colonial authorities, cannot be coordinated with the awakening of the African people. For example, the conference activities in Nigeria are a chain of conspiracy, division, and instigation. It is now using the same tactic to oppose the unity of African trade unions."

The various divisive activities carried out by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in Africa have completely exposed its role as an agent of imperialism, causing many African trade union organizations, even those that originally participated in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, to greatly deepen their aversion to it. The Ghana Trade Union Congress recently announced that it has severed all ties with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and it calls on all trade unions in Africa to do the same. The members of the Preparatory Committee of the All-African Trade Union Federation expressed regret for the divisive meeting convened by Tom Mboya, the chairman of the previous All-African People's Conference, in Lagos, and for his speech there against the unity of African trade unions.

The continuous strengthening of the trend towards unity among African trade unions is an inevitable result of the vigorous development of the African national liberation movement. Under the long-term cruel oppression and exploitation of imperialism, the African people live a life of poverty and lack of freedom. World War II awakened the broad masses of African people from their slumber. Since then, the ranks of the working class have grown rapidly. Taking French West Africa as an example, in 1934 the entire region had only 130,000 employees, which increased to 230,000 in 1946, and then to 370,000 in 1954. According to incomplete statistics, the number of employees in African countries (excluding Sudan and the United Arab Republic) has reached 9.5 million. Before World War II, the labor movement in most parts of the African continent was almost a blank slate, and trade unions were illegal. During and after World War II, the working class broke through the numerous shackles of imperialism, and trade union organizations developed and grew rapidly. Currently, there are more than 2.5 million organized workers. Encouraged by the continuous growth of the socialist camp and the surging national independence movement, the African working class, together with the people of all patriotic classes, actively participated in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism in order to strive for their own liberation and the liberation of the entire nation. The growth of the working class has further promoted the development of the African national liberation movement, and the national liberation movement has in turn promoted the continuous progress of the cause of unity and solidarity of the African working class.

The unity of African workers is something that imperialists and their agents cannot stop. As early as April 1947, the All-African Trade Union Conference was held in Dakar, West Africa. Representatives from 21 trade union organizations in British, French, and Belgian colonies in Africa attended the meeting, representing 800,000 African trade union members. This was the first trade union conference in African history with very broad representation. The meeting emphasized that the African working class can only unite to win trade union rights and improve the living conditions of African workers. The meeting firmly demanded opposition to racial discrimination, the right of African workers to organize trade unions, the implementation of social insurance without discrimination, and equal pay for equal work. Subsequently, the Second African Trade Union Conference was held in Bamako, French Sudan in October 1951. Representatives from 13 countries and regions in French Africa attended the meeting. The meeting prominently put forward that the task of the African labor movement is first to fight to liberate the African people from colonial exploitation. Only by ending colonial rule and striving for complete national independence can the situation of African workers be improved. This meeting also powerfully promoted the struggle for the implementation of the labor code in French Africa. After the Bandung Conference, the consciousness of the African working class was further enhanced. Immediately following last year's African Independent States Conference and the All-African People's Conference, the First Congress of the General Federation of Black African Trade Unions was held in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, in January this year. The conference emphasized anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism, pointed out that the direction of the efforts of the General Federation of Black African Trade Unions is to realize the unity of all African trade unions, and clearly proposed that an All-African Trade Union Conference should be convened in the future. The convening of this Accra All-African Trade Union Conference is a development of this series of events in the African labor movement after the war.

The African working class has learned from its own struggles that in order for the labor movement to continuously move forward, it must always be vigilant against the various conspiracies and tricks of imperialism. The more the African labor movement develops, the more cunning and rampant the destructive activities of imperialism become. Today, imperialists, especially American imperialists, are glaring at the African people and workers, baring their fangs, and are stepping up their efforts to divide and suppress the African labor movement in various ways. After U.S. Vice President Nixon visited Africa in 1957, he formally offered advice to the U.S. government, saying: "The U.S. government should pay close attention to the development of trade unions on the African continent. Our diplomatic representatives and consuls should gradually understand the trade union leaders of these countries on the basis of close relations. This is very important." This is ironclad evidence that the U.S. ruling clique is openly interfering in the African labor movement. In the past two or three years, the United States has generally added labor counselors to its embassies in Africa to directly work with African trade unions. It often uses U.S. dollars to buy off trade union cadres in certain African countries under the guise of "anti-colonialism." The British and French imperialists' suppression of the African labor movement has also become more sinister, and their strategy is "both hard and soft, divide and rule." At the same time, the contradictions between the vested interests of imperialism in Africa are also reflected in the labor movement. After Nixon's report on his visit to Africa was published, an editorial in the London "Times" openly stated: "The claim that the American labor movement should have a greater interest in African issues is not very appropriate. The African trade union movement is growing subtly, and it is best left to the trade unions of the countries that originally created the trade union movement to cultivate it." Although there is a contradictory side to imperialism in the competition for African rights and interests, they are consistent in suppressing the African labor movement and the national independence movement.

The anti-imperialist struggle of the African working class will be a long, arduous, and tortuous one. However, with the sympathy and support of the international working class, as long as the African working class holds high the banner of national independence, democracy, and progress, adheres to unity, adheres to struggle, and opposes division, then any conspiracy of imperialism will not succeed.

The entire African workers who built the Kariba Dam in Southern Rhodesia held a general strike. Their slogan was: "We don't want to die for four pence." Fourteen African workers fell into the tunnel and died, which led to the strike. The workers here work under conditions where their lives are not guaranteed, and their basic wage is only four pence per hour. The picture shows the striking workers.

    非洲工人阶级团结事业的重要发展
    杨重光
    11月5日至10日，非洲工会会议在加纳首都阿克拉举行了会议。会议决定成立全非工会联合会筹备委员会，由包括加纳、几内亚、摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚、尼日利亚、突尼斯、乌干达和其他非洲国家的十九名委员组成，委员会的总部设在阿克拉。会议决定1960年5月在摩洛哥卡萨布兰卡召开非洲工会代表大会。这是非洲工人运动的重要事件。
    非洲工会会议的召开是经过一段酝酿时期的。去年12月举行的全非人民大会曾向全非洲人民提出：为了争取非洲从殖民主义和帝国主义的枷锁下解放出来，非洲各国人民必须组织广泛的反帝统一战线。在全非人民大会的推动下，今年8月加纳和尼日利亚工会大会举行联席会议，双方同意成立西非工会联合会，这个联合会包括西非所有操英语、法语和葡语的地区。今年9月，摩洛哥劳工联合会、黑非洲工人总联合会、阿尔及利亚工人总联合会、阿拉伯工会国际联合会等代表在卡萨布兰卡举行会议，讨论非洲工会代表大会的准备工作问题。最近召开的这次会议，则使非洲工会代表大会的召开进一步具体化了。
    这次会议明确地提出了反帝的政治主张：在会议的宣言中说，全非工会联合会是为非洲的独立和自由的事业服务的，它的基本目标是“非洲的解放和统一”。在会议通过的行动纲领中说，殖民统治造成了非洲的分裂、落后、贫困和歧视，代表们保证将为非洲大陆的政治和经济解放进行无畏的和自我牺牲的斗争。纲领又说：“比利时、葡萄牙、西班牙、法国和英国这样一些殖民国家已经把种族歧视确立成为一种制度。非洲的市场继续受着外国资本主义的统治。反对阿尔及利亚人民的血腥的和非正义的战争正在进行着，怯尼亚、喀麦隆、比属刚果、尼亚萨兰和乌干达的人民正在受着最不开明的和最不人道的镇压。”“代表们将履行职责，以支持喀麦隆、怯尼亚、刚果、尼亚萨兰、冈比亚、乌干达和法兰西共同体的我们的兄弟为争取民族独立而进行的斗争。”这次会议也表达了全非工会联合会将广泛团结全体非洲工人的愿望。宣言表示：“全非工会联合会向非洲所有的工会组织开门，不论它们参加任何一个国际工会组织，它尊重非洲各国工会的自治。”会议并且表示：全非工会联合会是一个“积极中立的联合会”，它不参加国际工会组织，但对所有国际组织友好，“它还将为同一切全国性的和国际性的中央工会组织建立合作而努力”。摩洛哥“解放报”在评论这次会议的召开和全非工会联合会的行将成立时说：这次会议是非洲团结历史上最重要的事件，全非工会联合会将促使非洲的工人阶级能够同这个大陆上的剥削作斗争，使他们能掌握最好的手段进行争取解放的斗争。
    正由于这次非洲工会会议具有比较明显的反帝和统一团结的特点，因而引起了帝国主义和它们的代理人的极大的不安。当阿克拉会议正在举行的时候，在帝国主义的策划下，国际自由工会联合会在尼日利亚拉各斯也匆匆忙忙地扮演了一幕“非洲工会会议”的丑剧。它的目的是企图分裂非洲工人运动，同阿克拉会议唱对台戏，拆正在筹备中的全非工会联合会的台。尼日利亚著名的工会工作者戈果秋·尼日利布在“加纳工人报”上对此发表评论说：“国际自由工会联合会的上层领导，它在殖民当局的庇护下在非洲的所作所为，是无法同非洲人民的觉醒协调的。譬如在尼日利亚搞的会议活动，就是一条用阴谋、纷争和挑拨组成的链条。它现在同样用这个策略反对非洲工会的统一。”
    国际自由工会联合会在非洲所进行的各种分裂活动，彻底暴露了它的作为帝国主义代理人的面目，使许多非洲国家的工会组织甚至原来参加国际自由工会联合会的工会组织，对它的恶感大为加深。加纳工会大会最近宣布，它已经断绝同国际自由工会联合会的一切联系，它并且号召非洲所有工会都这样做。全非工会联合会筹备委员会委员们，对于上一届全非人民大会主席汤姆·姆鲍亚在拉各斯召开的分裂性会议，并在那里作了反对非洲工会统一的演说，表示遗憾。
    非洲工会走向统一趋势的不断加强，是非洲民族解放运动蓬勃发展的一个必然结果。在帝国主义长期的残酷的压迫和剥削下，非洲人民过着穷困和无自由的生活。第二次世界大战，使广大的非洲人民从沉睡中觉醒起来。工人阶级的队伍从此迅速成长。以法属西非为例，1934年整个地区只有十三万职工，1946年增至二十三万，1954年又增至三十七万。据不完全的统计，非洲大陆（不包括苏丹和阿联）各国的职工人数已达九百五十万人。在第二次世界大战以前，非洲大陆的大部分地区，工人运动几乎还是一片空白，工会都是不合法的。在第二次世界大战期间和战后，工人阶级冲破了帝国主义的重重束缚，工会组织迅速发展和壮大起来，目前有组织的工人已达二百五十万人以上。在社会主义阵营不断壮大、民族独立运动风起云涌形势的鼓舞下，非洲工人阶级为了争取自己和全民族的解放，同各爱国阶层人民一起，积极参加了反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争。工人阶级的成长，进一步推动了非洲民族解放运动的发展，民族解放运动又反过来促使非洲工人阶级统一团结事业不断进展。
    非洲工人走向统一，是帝国主义者及其代理人所无法阻挡的。早在1947年4月，全非工会会议就曾在西非达喀尔召开过。出席会议的有包括非洲英属、法属、比属等殖民地二十一个工会组织的代表，代表了八十万非洲工会会员。这是非洲历史上第一次代表性非常广泛的工会会议。会议强调：非洲工人阶级只有团结起来，才能争取到工会权利和改进非洲工人的生活条件。会议坚决要求反对种族歧视、非洲工人有权利组织工会、实行没有歧视的社会保险和同工同酬。此后，1951年10月在法属苏丹巴马科又召开了第二次非洲工会会议，出席这次会议的有来自法属非洲十三个国家和地区的代表。这次会议突出地提出：非洲工人运动的任务，首先是为了把非洲人民从殖民剥削下获得解放而斗争，只有结束殖民统治，争取完全的民族独立，非洲工人的处境才有可能得到改善。这个会议并且有力地推动了法属非洲争取实施劳动法典的斗争。在万隆会议以后，非洲工人阶级的觉悟有了进一步的提高。紧接去年非洲独立国家会议和全非人民大会之后，黑非洲工会总联合会第一次代表大会今年1月在几内亚首都科纳克里召开。大会强调反帝反殖民主义，指出黑非洲工会总联合会的努力方向是实现全非洲工会的统一，明确提出今后要召开全非工会会议。这次阿克拉全非工会会议的召开，是战后非洲工人运动这一系列事件的一个发展。
    非洲工人阶级从自己切身的斗争中体验到，工人运动要不断前进，必须时刻警惕帝国主义的各种阴谋诡计。非洲工人运动越是发展，帝国主义的破坏活动也越加狡猾和猖狂。今天，帝国主义特别是美帝国主义，正在虎视耽耽地向非洲人民和工人露出青面獠牙，正千方百计加紧用各种方式分裂和镇压非洲工人运动。1957年美国副总统尼克松访问非洲后，就曾正式向美国政府献策，他说：“美国政府应当密切注意非洲大陆的工会发展，我国的外交代表和领事应当逐渐在亲密关系的基础上了解这些国家的工会领袖，这是十分重要的。”这是美国统治集团公开干涉非洲工人运动的铁证。在最近两三年内，美国普遍在驻非洲的使馆内添设劳工参赞，直接对非洲工会进行工作，它打着“反殖民主义”的幌子经常用美元收买非洲某些国家的工会干部。英、法帝国主义对非洲工人运动的镇压，手段也变得更加阴险，它们的策略是“软硬兼施，分而治之”。同时，帝国主义在非洲既得利益的矛盾，在工人运动方面也有所反映。尼克松访问非洲的报告发表后，伦敦“泰晤士报”的社论就公开说：“关于美国工会运动应当对非洲问题有较大兴趣的这种主张是不大适宜的。非洲的工会运动在微妙地成长，并且最好留给原先创始工会运动的国家的工会来培植它。”帝国主义在争夺非洲权益方面虽然有矛盾的一面，但是他们要镇压非洲工人运动和民族独立运动却是一致的。
    非洲工人阶级的反帝斗争将是长期的、艰苦的、曲折的。但在国际工人阶级的同情和支持下，只要非洲工人阶级高举起民族独立、民主和进步的旗帜，坚持团结，坚持斗争，反对分裂，那么帝国主义的任何阴谋就不能得逞。（附图片）
