Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 5th: "Pathet Lao News" reported on November 1st: The people of Vientiane Province are continuing to carry out a national salvation movement throughout the province against the American interventionists and the Sananikone clique.

　　On October 15th, youths in Na An village seized an automatic rifle from a Sananikone army unit going on a "sweep" and wounded two enemy soldiers. On October 17th, a platoon of the Sananikone army went to Na Kham to conduct a "sweep." On their return, guerrillas wounded three enemy soldiers with homemade guns. The remaining enemy soldiers fled in panic, abandoning a rifle and some military supplies. On October 19th, a group of Sananikone army troops went to suppress the people of Sala Khan village, where guerrillas wounded three of them with rudimentary weapons. The people also seized some guns from the "Civilian Guard."

　　People from all walks of life in Vientiane and surrounding areas, including civil servants, monks, and soldiers, are very resentful of the Sananikone government's obedience to American orders, provoking civil war, and arresting and illegally trying Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front. Even members of the royal family and those who respect national customs have demanded that the Sananikone government allow Prince Souphanouvong to freely attend the funerals of King Sisavang Vong and Vice-King Phetsarath.

　　In many places in Vientiane Province, people have held meetings to denounce the crimes of the American interventionists and their running dogs, Sananikone, and the heads of the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests." They have also sent suggestions to the Royal Government, the National Assembly, and the Lao Patriotic Front, demanding that the Sananikone government immediately restore the freedom of patriotic and peace-loving people who have been unreasonably detained.

　　In addition, according to a report by "Pathet Lao News" on October 28th, on October 26th, the people of Vientiane wrote a letter to the American Embassy in Laos, condemning the imperialist actions of the United States in interfering in Laos and demanding that the American interventionists get out of Laos.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 6th: According to a report by "Pathet Lao News" on November 2nd, the people of all strata in Luang Prabang are very dissatisfied with the Sananikone clique for relying on the United States to launch a civil war and persecute the Lao Patriotic Front.

　　Many soldiers in the Royal Army of Luang Prabang said that at present, all the people strongly oppose the US-Sananikone clique. They are ignored wherever they go and are hated. They are very afraid of being attacked by guerrillas during "sweeps." Many soldiers have received leaflets from the people saying, "Surrendering to the people is better than being cannon fodder for the United States."

　　Most of the civil servants of the Sananikone government believe that the Sananikone government is hated by the people of the whole country. They said, "American aid is enjoyed by the officials, while the civil servants live a dark and hopeless life." Some civil servants resentfully stated, "We can no longer serve the traitors."

　　The monks said that it is now very difficult to preach. If they preach more about the Buddhist principles of not killing and not breaking faith, the authorities will say that they are speaking ill of the government and helping to promote the policies of the Lao Patriotic Front.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 6th: According to a report by "Pathet Lao News" on November 2nd, the people of Sam Neua Province have launched a widespread struggle to protect the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front and oppose the US-Sananikone clique.

　　On October 29th, 455 people from So Sang and Na Nong townships in Khoune District held a meeting and passed suggestions to the Lao Royal Authorities, the National Assembly, and the Lao Patriotic Front, demanding that the Sananikone government restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, stop the "sweeps" and persecution of patriotic people and former resistance personnel, demand that the US imperialist military personnel withdraw from Laos, and demand that the Sananikone government strictly implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements.

　　Representatives of all ethnic groups in Hiem District also held a meeting to oppose the Sananikone government's preparation to "try" the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front. 392 mass representatives from five townships, including Sang Det, Song Nuea, Youan, Muang Po, and Sa Thun in Muang Son District, also held a meeting demanding that the Sananikone government revoke the decision to "try" the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

　　Since October 16th, in Sam Neua Province, the Sananikone clique and the heads of the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" have sent troops and "Civilian Guards" to carry out "sweeps" in the Song Khao and Muang Fen areas. They killed some civilians and three demobilized soldiers of the former Lao Fighting Forces and stabbed a village chief to death. The Sananikone army burned many houses in the villages of Na Lun and Muang Wen. The local people felt extremely angry about these actions, and they participated in the anti-"sweep" struggle.

    10月15日，纳安村的青年夺取了去“扫荡”的萨纳尼空军队的一支自动步枪并击伤两名敌军。10月17日，萨纳尼空军队的一个班到纳坎进行“扫荡”，在返回时，游击队用土枪打伤三名敌军，剩余的敌军抱头逃跑，丢下了一支枪和一些军需物资。10月19日，一批萨纳尼空军队去镇压沙拉坎村的人民时，被游击队用简陋的武器打伤了三名，人民还缴获了“民卫队”的一些枪支。
    万象和附近地区各阶层人民，其中包括职员、僧侣、士兵等对萨纳尼空政府顺从美国的命令，挑起内战，逮捕和非法审判苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的行为非常愤恨。甚至皇族中的人士和尊重民族风俗的人士也要求萨纳尼空政府让苏发努冯亲王自由参加国王西萨旺·冯和副国王佩差拉的葬礼。
    万象省许多地方的人民纷纷举行集会，控诉美国干涉者及其走狗萨纳尼空和所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们的罪行，他们还向王国政府、国民议会和老挝爱国战线党发出建议书，要求萨纳尼空政府立即恢复被无理拘禁的爱国、爱和平人士的自由。

    僧侣们说，现在讲经很不容易，如果多讲一些戒杀人和背信的佛教道理，就会被当局说成是讲政府坏话，帮助宣传老挝爱国战线党的政策。
