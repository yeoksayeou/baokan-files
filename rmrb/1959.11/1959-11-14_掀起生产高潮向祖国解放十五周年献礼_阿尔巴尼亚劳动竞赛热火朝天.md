    Launching a Production Upsurge to Greet the 15th Anniversary of the Motherland's Liberation
    Albania's Labor Competition is in Full Swing
    (Our dispatch) A socialist labor competition to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation is now in full swing across Albania.
    Whether in the capital, Tirana, or in other cities, whether in factories and mines or in the countryside, challenge posters, honorary red lists, and eye-catching competition slogans can be seen everywhere. Friendly competitions are taking place between people, teams, and factories. According to statistics from the Albanian General Trade Union, by the end of September, more than 390 factories, mines, and labor collectives had participated in the competition, and hundreds of production innovators and rationalization proponents had emerged.
    In order to celebrate the national holiday of the fifteenth anniversary of Albania's liberation on November 29, the broad masses of Albanian working people proposed to dedicate a production upsurge to the motherland as early as the end of last year. In January of this year, young workers at the Stalin Textile Joint Factory first proposed the initiative to strive for the title of "Production Team for the 15th Anniversary of the Motherland's Liberation." The conditions for the competition were: all members of the production team must produce well and economically, while constantly improving their technical and cultural level and communist consciousness. This initiative received active support from the Albanian Labor Party, the trade union, and the youth league, and was quickly promoted from within the factory to outside the factory, and from the capital to all parts of the country. The number of production teams striving to obtain this glorious title increased day by day, reaching 347 in the first half of this year, and surging to 674 by the end of August, including more than 80 production teams from agricultural cooperatives, with the number of participants reaching more than 7,200. One good news after another of exceeding the original production quota and completing the plan ahead of schedule came in. In the first six months of this year, 297 production teams completed their production plans more than ten days ahead of schedule, increasing the country's production by more than 28 million leks (Albanian currency) and reducing costs by more than 10 million leks. Workers in 22 factories in the capital, Tirana, broke the old quotas. In the first three quarters, 285 enterprises across Albania completed or overfulfilled their plans, and the national industrial and mining enterprises overproduced products worth 800 million leks. The workers of the Stalin Textile Factory proposed in the early stage of the competition to overproduce 240,000 meters of cotton cloth in 1959, but they had overproduced 346,000 meters of cotton cloth in the first three quarters.
    With the high tide of the competition, advanced workers put forward various competition contents based on the nature of their work and the conditions of their factories and mines and competitors. Some proposed to reduce costs as the main link of the competition, some proposed to save materials, some proposed to increase the utilization rate of tools, some proposed not to waste time, etc. All these further enriched the socialist competition and were quickly accepted by the broad masses of working people across the country. The Misto Mamei production team, which advocated saving raw materials, saved raw materials worth more than 620,000 leks in just three months. The movement of not wasting time was first proposed by workers in the Durrës Tobacco Factory. They advocated cherishing every minute and second, making full and effective use of time, and devoting all their energy to production.
    The rationalization proposal movement, which had already started last year, is now more in-depth. Taking the materials from the first half of this year as an example, workers and farmers across the country put forward more than 19,000 rationalization proposals, of which more than 9,000 have been examined and approved, and 3,391 have been adopted and implemented, creating a total value of more than 120 million leks. At present, the exemplary deeds of the Soviet advanced textile worker and Communist Party member Gaganova in helping backward catch up with the advanced are encouraging workers throughout Albania. Gaganova's lofty communist style educates thousands of workers, making them more actively contribute everything to the collective cause.
    Many outstanding workers in Albania have requested to transfer to backward production teams. Vesel Balla is an advanced work team leader in the Stalin Textile Factory. The production team he led completed 113% of the production plan on average every month. In order to learn from Gaganova and seek a common upsurge in production, he did not care about personal gains and losses and voluntarily requested to go to the production team that often completed 77% of the plan to help them improve labor organization and improve technology. Under his reasonable arrangement and patient help, the backward production team has rapidly risen to the level of completing 100% of its tasks. People like Balla are not individual cases, and many outstanding figures and moving stories continue to emerge in the movement. Recently, many advanced workers in this factory have requested to transfer to backward workshops and production teams, and many backward units are rapidly catching up with the advanced. For example, with the help of model female worker Vita, a backward production team increased its daily completion rate from 60% to 90% in three days.
    In the vast rural areas, the socialist labor competition is also in full swing. For example, in the Baorshi Agricultural Cooperative in Saranda, the southernmost city of Albania, ten young people, in order to strive for the title of "Production Team for the 15th Anniversary of the Motherland's Liberation," worked hard and cleverly, and reclaimed seventeen hectares of wasteland, burned 240,000 bricks, and planted more than 500 orange trees in a short period of time. Therefore, the Youth League organization in Saranda not only approved their team as the "Production Team for the 15th Anniversary of the Motherland's Liberation" but also named their team after the national hero Gaseem Lali. The workers of the Luzenze Tractor Station completed the annual plan on September 17, creating a new national record of completing the annual plan one month and twenty days ahead of schedule.

    掀起生产高潮向祖国解放十五周年献礼
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动竞赛热火朝天
    本报讯　为迎接解放十五周年的社会主义劳动竞赛，目前在阿尔巴尼亚全国各地搞得热火朝天。
    不管在首都地拉那或在其他城市，不管在工厂矿山或者在农村，到处可以看到挑战的墙报、光荣的红榜和醒目的竞赛标语。人与人、队与队、厂与厂之间到处都在展开友谊的竞赛。据阿尔巴尼亚总工会统计，到9月底为止，参加竞赛的已有三百九十多个厂矿和劳动集体，涌现出了几百个生产革新者和合理化倡议者。
    为迎接11月29日阿尔巴尼亚解放十五周年这个全民的节日，早从去年年底，阿尔巴尼亚广大劳动人民就提出了要以生产的高潮来向祖国献礼。今年1月，斯大林纺织联合工厂的青年工人，首先提出了争取“祖国解放十五周年生产队”称号的倡议，竞赛的条件是：生产队的全体成员必须又好又省地进行生产，同时必须不断地提高技术、文化水平和共产主义的觉悟。这个倡议获得了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、工会和青年联盟的积极支持，很快地就从厂内推广到厂外，从首都推广到全国各地。为争取获得这一光荣称号的生产队一天比一天增多，今年上半年就已达三百四十七个，到8月底，更激增到了六百七十四个，其中有八十多个是农业合作社的生产队，参加人数达七千二百多人。超过原有生产定额提前完成计划的捷报也一个接着一个传来，在今年头六个月中，有二百九十七个生产队分别提前十多天完成了生产计划，他们为国家增产了二千八百多万里克（阿币），降低成本一千多万里克。首都地拉那有二十二个工厂的职工打破了旧有的定额。头三个季度中，阿尔巴尼亚全国有二百八十五个企业完成或超额完成了计划，全国工矿企业超额生产了八亿里克的产品。斯大林纺织厂的工人在竞赛初期提出1959年要超额生产二十四万米棉布，但在头三个季度就已超额生产了三十四万六千米棉布。
    随着竞赛热潮的高涨，先进工人根据自己的劳动性质，自己厂矿和竞赛对手的条件，纷纷提出了多种多样的竞赛内容。有的提出以降低成本为竞赛的主要一环，有的提出了节省材料，有的提出了增加工具的使用率，有的提出了不浪费时间……等等。所有这些更丰富了社会主义竞赛，并且很快地为全国广大劳动人民所接受。倡议节约原材料的米斯托·马麦生产队，仅仅三个月内节省下的原材料，就价值六十二万多里克。不浪费时间的运动首先是都拉索烟草厂工人提出的，他们倡议要珍惜一分一秒的时间，要十分合理、有效地利用时间，把全部的精力都用到生产中去。
    从去年就已开始的合理化建议运动，今天更加深入了，仅以今年上半年的材料为例，全国各地工人、农民提出的合理化建议即达一万九千多条，其中审定的已有九千多条，被采纳实施的有三千三百九十一条，它们所创造的价值共达一亿二千多万里克。目前，苏联先进纺织女工、共产党员加干诺娃的帮助落后赶先进的模范事迹，正鼓舞着全阿尔巴尼亚的工人。加干诺娃崇高的共产主义风格教育着千万工人，使他们更积极地为集体事业贡献一切力量。
    阿尔巴尼亚很多的优秀工作者都要求转到落后的生产队去。维赛尔·巴纳是斯大林纺织工厂的一个先进工作队长，他领导的生产队平均每月都完成生产计划113％，为了同加干诺娃学习，求得生产的共同高涨，他毫不计较个人的得失，自愿请求到经常完成计划77％的生产队去，帮助他们改进劳动组织和提高技术。在他合理的安排和耐心的帮助下，落后的生产队已迅速地提升到百分之百地完成任务的水平。像巴纳这样的人并不是个别的，许多出色的人物和动人的故事不断地在运动中涌现出来。最近，这个工厂的许多先进工作者纷纷要求转到落后车间和生产队去，不少落后单位正在迅速赶上先进。例如在模范女工维塔的帮助下，一个落后生产队在三天内就使过去每天完成计划60％提高到90％。
    在广大农村，社会主义劳动竞赛也同样热火朝天。例如在阿尔巴尼亚极南端的萨兰达城的鲍尔萧农业合作社，有十个青年为争取获得“祖国解放十五周年生产队”的称号，他们苦干巧干，在短短的时间内就开垦了十七公顷荒地，烧出了二十四万块砖，种上了五百多棵橘子树，因此萨兰达城的青年联盟组织不仅批准了他们队为“祖国解放十五周年生产队”，并且以民族英雄加赛姆·拉里的名字为他们的队命名。卢森泽拖拉机站的工人在9月17日就完成了年度计划，创造了提前一个月零二十天完成年度计划的全国新纪录。
