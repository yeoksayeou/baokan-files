Academic and Cultural Trends

The Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Strengthens Research on Realistic Economic Issues

Comrade Kan. Plotnikov, Director of the Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, recently published an article in the Soviet "Economic Issues" magazine introducing the current research situation and future tasks of the Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

Comrade Plotnikov said that at the current stage of socialist economic development, economic research must be closely coordinated with the specific tasks of developing the national economy, so that theoretical research can provide accurate scientific suggestions for realistic economic issues. At present, the Soviet Economic Research Institute has formulated and is implementing a number of theoretical research plans on realistic economic issues. The main issues include: socialist expanded reproduction, increasing social labor productivity, the economic effects of investment and the adoption of new technologies, the development of economic ties between regions within the country, socialist production allocation, the law of value, economic accounting and pricing, planned division of labor and economic cooperation between countries in the world socialist economic system, and so on. The purpose of studying these issues is to tap existing potentials in the national economy through extensive and comprehensive research on specific materials and investigation results, and to formulate more reasonable and effective methods of utilizing resources in order to smoothly solve the tasks of the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for developing the national economy. They believe that when studying a problem, the focus should be on the central issue that is decisive for making scientific suggestions.

In addition, this year they also studied the history of the Soviet national economy and the history of Soviet economic thought.

In order to improve research quality and shorten research time, the form of scientific research has been reconsidered this year, that is, as scientific research is completed, scientific reports with specific suggestions are submitted, instead of waiting for the completion of all topics to submit and publish scientific reports. This greatly shortens the completion date of scientific research, thereby improving research effectiveness.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea Actively Carries Out Philosophical Research Activities

The Department of Philosophy of the Institute of History of the Korean Academy of Sciences is currently the center of philosophical research in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Department of Philosophy of the Institute of History was established in 1956, but some philosophers began research work as early as 1953. The topics they studied included: "The Inheritance of National Culture" and "Experience in the Struggle Against Sectarianism in the Workers' Movement," and so on. In 1956, philosophers and historians jointly studied issues such as: "The Creative Application of Marxism by the Korean Workers' Party in the Korean People's Struggle to Build a Democratic and Independent Country," "Hegel's Philosophy," and "Critique of Modern Bourgeois Philosophy and Sociology," and so on.

From 1957, the Department of Philosophy entered a new research stage and formulated a long-term research plan. Recently, the issues being studied include: "The Emergence and Development of the Socialist Foundation and Superstructure in Korea," "The Contradictions in the Transition Period in Korea and Their Solutions," "The Development of Ancient Korean Materialist Thought," "The Philosophical Views of Bourgeois Enlightenment Thinkers," "The Spread and Development of Marxist-Leninist Thought in Korea," "The Creative Development of Marxist-Leninist Thought by the Korean Workers' Party After Liberation," "Critique of Bourgeois Philosophical Schools in South Korea," and so on.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea plans to publish a textbook on the history of Korean philosophy before 1965, and in the next four or five years will publish a special work on the spread and development of Marxist-Leninist philosophical thought in Korea in the past thirty years. A specialized philosophical magazine will also be published later.

In the two and a half years since the establishment of the Department of Philosophy of the Institute of History, it has held three philosophical discussions, discussing the following three issues: 1. Strengthening the foundation of revolutionary democracy and the peaceful reunification of the motherland; 2. The emergence and development of the foundation and superstructure of socialist society in Korea; 3. The emergence and development of the people's democratic system in Korea.

    苏联科学院经济研究所加强现实经济问题的研究工作
    苏联科学院经济研究所所长康·普洛特尼科夫同志，不久以前在苏联“经济问题”杂志撰文介绍了苏联科学院经济研究所当前的研究情况和今后的任务。
    普洛特尼科夫同志说，在社会主义经济发展的现阶段，经济问题的研究工作必须同发展国民经济的具体任务密切地配合起来，使理论研究能对现实的经济问题提出准确的科学建议。目前，苏联经济研究所已制定了并正在实现着许多现实的经济问题的理论研究计划。主要的问题有：社会主义扩大再生产问题，提高社会劳动生产率问题，投资和采用新技术的经济效果问题，国内各地区之间生产经济联系的发展问题，社会主义生产配置问题，价值规律问题，经济核算和价格形成问题，世界社会主义经济体系各国之间的有计划分工和经济合作问题，等等。研究这些问题的目的是：在广泛和全面研究具体材料及调查结果等等的基础上，挖掘国民经济中现有的潜力，制定比较合理而有效地利用资源的方法，以便顺利解决苏联发展国民经济七年计划的任务。他们认为，在研究某个问题时，重点应当放在对提出科学建议具有决定意义的中心问题上。
    此外，他们今年还研究了苏联国民经济史问题和苏联经济思想史问题。
    为了提高研究质量和缩短研究时限，今年重新考虑了实现科学研究的形式，即随着科学研究的完成情形，提出带有具体建议的科学报告，而不等待全部题目的完成才提出和出版科学报告。这样就大大地缩短了科学研究的完成日期，从而提高了研究效果。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国积极开展哲学研究活动
    朝鲜科学院历史研究所哲学部是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国目前哲学研究的中心。历史研究所的哲学部成立于1956年，但有一部分哲学家从1953年起就开始了研究工作。他们研究的题目有：“民族文化的继承问题”、“对工人运动中的宗派主义进行斗争的经验”等等。1956年哲学家和历史学家共同研究了这样一些问题：“朝鲜劳动党在朝鲜人民争取建设民主的和独立的国家的斗争中创造性地运用马克思主义”、“黑格尔的哲学”、“现代资产阶级哲学和社会学的批判”等等。
    从1957年开始，哲学部进入了新的研究阶段，制定了长期的研究计划。最近正在研究的问题有：“朝鲜社会主义基础和上层建筑的发生和发展”、“朝鲜过渡时期的矛盾及其解决途径”、
  “古代朝鲜唯物主义思想的发展”、“资产阶级启蒙思想家的哲学观点”、“马克思列宁主义思想在朝鲜的传播和发展”、“朝鲜劳动党在解放后对马克思列宁主义思想的创造性的发展”、“南朝鲜资产阶级哲学流派的批判”等等。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国预定，1965年以前将出版一部朝鲜哲学史的教材，最近四、五年内将出版关于近三十年来马克思列宁主义哲学思想在朝鲜的传播和发展的专门著作。以后还将出版一种专门的哲学杂志。
    历史研究所的哲学部成立的两年半以来，举行了三次哲学讨论会，讨论了下列三个问题：一、加强革命民主主义的基础和祖国的和平统一；二、朝鲜社会主义社会基础和上层建筑的产生和发展；三、朝鲜人民民主主义制度的产生和发展。
