    Nursery of Communism
    Visiting the Jinjuluo Management Station Kindergarten of the Chengguan People's Commune in Miyun County
    By Our Correspondent Yao Di
    "Hello, Auntie! Hello, Uncle!" As soon as we entered the Jinjuluo Kindergarten of the Jinjuluo Management Station of the Chengguan People's Commune in Miyun County (directly under Beijing Municipality), a group of innocent and lively children greeted the guests like this. A moment later, the young aunt led the children in singing the song "Little Saplings" while clapping their hands. From the children's generous and lively expressions and their healthy little faces, we saw that the second generation of New China is growing up happily and healthily.

    Children Enter Paradise, Aunties are Better Than Mothers
    The kindergarten we visited is relatively close to the management station, and like the other kindergartens in the management station, it is located in an ordinary courtyard. The kindergarten has more than one hundred children, divided into two classes, large and small, cared for by four eighteen-year-old girls. The nannies all have junior high school and primary school education, and one of them is a member of the Communist Youth League. We entered the children's activity room, which consisted of two large rooms. When it rains or snows, or when the sun is too strong in summer, the children play and sing here. The other room contains tables and benches and is used for eating. Outside, there is an inner courtyard and a fairly spacious outer courtyard, which are the children's regular playgrounds. Although the facilities are simple and plain, everything is clean, tidy, and well-organized.

    Leaving the kindergarten and arriving at the management station's office, we talked about the kindergarten's situation in the room of Comrade Wang Shumin, the women's director. Since the communization, a total of seven kindergartens and six nurseries have been established here, averaging one per village among the thirteen villages. Now, every kindergarten can adhere to the health care system, and the children have generally developed hygiene habits such as washing their faces, washing their hands, and drinking boiled water. The children's bowls and chopsticks are also washed, scalded, and disinfected after each meal. The nannies also educate the children to have regular haircuts and nail clippings. When they find that a child is feeling unwell, they personally take the child to see a doctor or notify the parents to take them back for isolation to avoid infecting other children. In February and March of this year, during the measles epidemic, each kindergarten gave the children preventive medicine, so no child in the entire management station contracted measles. During the dysentery epidemic in the summer, each kindergarten also paid attention to strictly disinfecting the children's bowls and chopsticks, preventing the children from drinking raw water and eating rotten melons, etc., so very few children got dysentery.

    In order to enhance the children's physical fitness and ensure that they eat enough and enjoy their meals, the management station specially allocated more refined grains and vegetables to the kindergartens. For coarse grains, the cooks in the kindergarten canteen also used their brains to refine the coarse grains, such as grinding beans into flour for the children to eat, grinding corn very finely, and making cakes that were as good as refined grains, trying to make each meal different and each serving varied, so that the children could often eat delicious noodles, steamed buns, rice porridge, and sometimes fried bean flour balls. The children all ate until they were rosy and plump.

    In addition to paying attention to cultivating the children's hygiene habits, the kindergarten also paid special attention to teaching the children to be polite, love the collective, and be mutually helpful and friendly. Some children liked to fight and curse before entering the kindergarten, but after the nannies' patient education, they realized that fighting and cursing were wrong and changed. The children also learned to sing and dance in the kindergarten, and their personalities became very lively.

    In the past, women had low work attendance, but now they are the main force.
    Speaking of kindergartens, everyone here, whether male or female, old or young, praises them. When it comes to the benefits of kindergartens, women feel it most deeply. Before communization, women with children were like having a rope tied to their feet, unable to go far. They spent the whole day cooking, grinding, and taking care of their children. Although some women also went to work in the fields, their bodies were in the fields but their minds were at home, and they would sneak home to check on their children after working in the fields for a short while. Before communization, the work attendance rate of women in the entire management station was only 50%, and most of those who participated in labor were women without children.

    With the development of the communization movement in 1958, kindergartens and nurseries were established one after another, solving the fundamental problem that women could not often go to work. They generally reflected: "We have been liberated, and our lives have improved, but women have only been half liberated. Now that communization has established kindergartens, we women are completely liberated." After the children of single men like Li Delong and Wang Yonghe entered the kindergarten, not only did they eat well and have someone to take care of them, but the nannies also mended their clothes when they were torn, so the fathers could work more steadily in the fields. At present, the average enrollment rate of children in kindergartens throughout the management station has reached 82.6% of eligible children, and some villages, such as Zoumazhuang, have reached 100%.

    With the children entering the kindergartens, the women were freed from years of burden, and they all happily walked out of their homes to participate in production, and their work attendance rate greatly increased from 50% before communization to 90%, and 100% during busy agricultural seasons. This summer, more than 200 mu of late millet in Xiwengzhuang had to be harvested and weeded immediately. Pulling millet is hard work, and women generally do not do this kind of work. However, at that time, 64 villages near the Miyun Reservoir were facing relocation, and all the male laborers had to help with the relocation. In response to this situation, the leadership held a Leap Forward meeting and explained the situation to the women. Suddenly, all the women enthusiastically signed up to participate. They sent their children to the kindergartens and persisted in working in the fields for more than a month. During the summer harvest, labor was also very tight, and 350 women from the whole village were mobilized to participate in the wheat harvest. At that time, both the child enrollment rate and the women's work attendance rate reached 100%. During the day, men, women, old, and young were not at home, and in the evening, each family was reunited. The young people talked about their work, and the mothers were busy asking about the children's kindergarten activities. The whole family was filled with a happy and joyful atmosphere.

    Run the Kindergartens Better and Better
    In order to further improve the quality of kindergartens, the management station also established a special child care committee, which holds regular meetings to study the work of the kindergartens and nurseries throughout the station. Issues such as children's education and upbringing, kindergarten equipment, food, and the improvement of sanitary conditions are all discussed and decided. In addition, each village has also established a parents' committee, through which parents can promptly offer praise or suggestions for the strengths and weaknesses of the kindergarten work, and urge the kindergarten to do its work better and better. The parents are very concerned about the kindergartens. Some people find that the kindergartens lack firewood, so they personally go to collect firewood. Some people find that the kindergartens lack benches, so they move their own from home. They said: "The children eat well and play well in the kindergartens, so the parents can concentrate on production. We must run the kindergartens better and better."

    共产主义的苗圃
    访密云县城关公社金巨罗管理站幼儿园
    本报记者　姚堤
    “阿姨好，叔叔好！”我们刚走进密云县（直属北京市）城关人民公社金巨罗管理站金巨罗幼儿园，一群天真活泼的孩子立刻这样喊着欢迎客人。一会儿，年轻的阿姨领着孩子们拍着手唱了个“小树苗”的歌。从孩子们那大方活泼的神情，一个个健康的小脸上，我们看到了新中国的第二代正在幸福、健康地成长着。
    孩子进乐园，阿姨赛妈妈
    我们参观的这个幼儿园是比较靠近管理站的，它和管理站的其他幼儿园一样，设在一个普通的院子里。园里一百多名孩子，分成了大小两个班，由四个十八岁的姑娘照管着。保育员都具有高小和初小文化程度，其中有一个还是共青团员。我们走进了孩子们的活动室，这里是两间宽大的屋子，每当下雨下雪天或者在夏天阳光太强烈的时候，孩子们就在这里游戏、唱歌，另外一间屋放的是桌子板凳，是吃饭的地方。屋外还有一个里院和一个相当宽敞的外院，是孩子们经常的游戏场所。设备虽然简单朴素，但是处处整洁清爽，井井有条。
    走出幼儿园，来到了管理站办公的地方，我们就在妇女主任王叔敏同志的屋子里谈起了幼儿园的情况。公社化以来，这里共建立了七所幼儿园，六所托儿所，十三个村子平均每村一个。现在，每个幼儿园都能坚持执行保健制度，孩子们普遍养成了洗脸、洗手、喝开水等卫生习惯。儿童的碗筷也是每餐都洗烫消毒，保育员们还教育孩子们经常理发和剪指甲等。当她们发现孩子有点不舒服，就亲自带孩子去看病或者通知家长接回去隔离，避免传染给别的孩子。今年2、3月，正是麻疹流行季节，每个幼儿园都给孩子们吃了预防药，因此全管理站没有一个孩子得麻疹。夏天痢疾流行，各幼儿园也都注意孩子们的碗筷严格消毒，不让孩子喝生水、吃烂瓜等，得痢疾的孩子也很少。
    为了增强孩子的体质，保证孩子们吃得饱，吃得香，管理站专门拨给幼儿园较多的细粮和蔬菜。对于粗粮，幼儿食堂的炊事员也是开动脑筋，粗粮细作，如自己动手把豆子磨成面给孩子吃，把玉米磨得特别细，做出来的糕和细粮一样，尽量做到餐餐不同、顿顿变样，使孩子们经常吃到可口的面条、豆包、米粥，有时还吃到油炸的豆面丸子。孩子们一个个吃得红红胖胖的。
    幼儿园里除注意培养孩子的卫生习惯外，还特别注意让孩子懂得礼貌，爱集体，互助友爱。有些孩子未入园前喜欢打架骂人，进园后经过阿姨的耐心教育，知道打架骂人不对就改了。孩子们在幼儿园里还学会了唱歌、跳舞，性格变得十分活泼。过去妇女出勤少，如今成了主力军
    谈起幼儿园，这里无论男的、女的、老的、小的，无人不夸。提起幼儿园的好处，妇女们体会得特别深切。公社化以前，有了孩子的妇女就好像脚上拴了根绳子，走不到远处去。她们整天除了烧火做饭、推磨外，就是守着孩子。有些妇女虽然也下地干活，但是身在地里心在家里，在地里干不多会儿就要溜回家去看看。公社化以前，全管理站的妇女出勤率只达到50％，参加劳动的多数是无牵挂的妇女。
    随着1958年公社化运动的开展，这里先后建立起幼儿园、托儿所，妇女不能经常下地的根本问题解决了。她们普遍反映：解放了，生活是提高了，但是妇女只解放了一半。现在公社化建立幼儿园，我们妇女才算是彻底解放了。像李德隆、王永和等单身汉的孩子进了幼儿园后，不但吃得好，有人照管，衣服破了保育员还给缝缝补补，爸爸们下地干活更踏实了。目前，全管理站孩子入园率平均达适龄儿童的82.6％，其中有的村子像走马庄达到100％。
    随着孩子入园，妇女们摆脱了多年的牵累，她们都兴高彩烈地走出家门，参加生产，出勤率大大提高，由公社化前的50％提高到90％，农活忙时则达到100％。今年夏天，溪翁庄有二百多亩晚谷要马上收割、锄草。拔谷子是累活，过去妇女一般不干这种活。但是当时正面临着密云水库附近六十四个村子的移民户搬家，男劳力全部要去帮着搬家。针对这种情况，领导上召开了个跃进会，向妇女们讲解了这种情况，一时，全部妇女踊跃报名参加，她们纷纷把孩子送入幼儿园，自己在地里坚持干了一个多月。夏收的时候，劳力也十分紧张，全村又出动了三百五十名妇女参加麦收。在那个时候，孩子入园率和妇女出勤率都达到100％。白天，男的、女的、老的、小的都不在家，到了晚上，各家各户又是团团地围坐在一起。青年人谈着他们劳动的情况，妈妈忙着问孩子幼儿园的事情，整个家庭充满了一片幸福、欢乐的气氛。
      把幼儿园越办越好
    为了进一步提高幼儿园的质量，管理站还专门成立了一个托幼委员会，定期开会研究全站幼儿园、托儿所工作开展情况，像孩子的教养工作和幼儿园的设备、伙食以及卫生条件的改善等问题，都经过讨论作出决定。此外，各村也都成立了家长委员会，对幼儿园工作中的优缺点，家长们就通过这个机构及时提出表扬或建议，督促幼儿园的工作越做越好。家长们十分关心幼儿园，有人发现幼儿园缺柴禾，就马上亲自去捡柴，有人发现幼儿园里缺板凳就把自家的搬了去。他们说：孩子们进了幼儿园吃得好、玩得好，家长们才能安心生产，一定要把幼儿园越办越好。
