Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, November 4th. The Ministry of Chemical Industry recently held an on-site meeting on small synthetic ammonia plants in Lüda. More than two hundred representatives from various provinces and cities across the country visited the small synthetic ammonia plant created by the Dalian Chemical Plant. After listening to introductions of relevant technical and economic data, they unanimously agreed that this plant was successful and promising. It embodies the victory of the "walking on two legs" approach in the development of the fertilizer industry.

The meeting called on workers on the national chemical front to exert their utmost efforts and strive for the top, so that this small plant would blossom all over the country in the shortest possible time, producing large quantities of high-quality nitrogen fertilizer to support the people's communes in achieving the twelve-year agricultural development program ahead of schedule.

The representatives came to Lüda and first visited the simply built small synthetic ammonia plant, and all believed that it was basically a scaled-down version of similar large-scale plants, with relatively stable production. Trucks and horse-drawn carts from suburban people's communes frequently transported ammonia water from here. The wastewater from the small plant flowed past the nearby vegetable garden, irrigating the vegetables, which grew lush and large. After seeing this scene, many representatives said: "Before coming here, we thought fertilizer production was complicated, and small indigenous groups and small foreign groups would probably not work; now our views have changed. Small synthetic ammonia plants are both easy to build and easy to use!"

After the representatives' on-site visits, the meeting officially opened. Hou Debang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, delivered an opening speech, saying: The purpose of this meeting is to respond to the call of the Central Committee, oppose right-leaning tendencies, and boost morale, so as to better implement the policy of "walking on two legs" in the fertilizer industry. Fertilizer production is a relatively young industry in modern times, and our country's original foundation was very weak; although production has increased sharply in the past few years of the Great Leap Forward, it still falls far short of meeting agricultural needs. The newly emerged small synthetic ammonia plants provide a strong and powerful leg for our country to develop nitrogen fertilizer production at a higher speed; after widespread promotion, it can provide large amounts of nitrogen fertilizer in a short period of time to support agricultural production. If each county across the country builds one in the near future, the nitrogen fertilizer produced will be enough to fertilize hundreds of millions of mu of land, which will have a huge effect on achieving the targets set by the agricultural development program ahead of schedule.

After several days of discussion, the representatives further realized that the policy of "walking on two legs" is fully applicable to the development of the fertilizer industry. At the meeting, the representatives also determined the steps to promote small synthetic ammonia plants: First, seize the time and install the thirty-five sets of small synthetic ammonia plant equipment that the Ministry of Chemical Industry has arranged to manufacture in various provinces and cities as soon as possible, as "model plants" to gain experience from them; then, promote them on a large scale.

The meeting also made arrangements for the necessary material conditions for building small synthetic ammonia plants.

Representatives from the State Planning Commission, the Economic Commission, the Science and Technology Commission, as well as representatives from various provinces and cities, and relevant scientific research departments and universities participated in this meeting.

    卅五个小型合成氨厂将先在各省建立起来
    据新华社旅大4日电　化工部最近在旅大召开了小型合成氨厂现场会议。来自全国各省市的二百多位代表，参观了大连化工厂创建的小型合成氨厂，听取了有关的技术、经济资料介绍以后，一致认为这个厂是成功的，有前途的，它体现了两条腿走路的方针在发展化肥工业方面的胜利。
    会议号召全国化工战线上的职工，鼓足干劲，力争上游，让这个小厂在尽可能短的时间内，在全国遍地开花，生产出大量的、优质的氮肥，支援人民公社提前实现十二年农业发展纲要。
    代表们来到旅大，首先参观了外形简陋的小型合成氨厂，都认为它基本上是同类大型工厂的缩小，生产相当稳定。郊区人民公社的汽车和马车，不时从这里运走氨水，小厂的废水从邻近的菜园旁边流过，灌溉了蔬菜，蔬菜长得又青又大。许多代表看了这种情景以后说：“来这以前，还认为化肥生产是复杂的，小土群、小洋群恐怕不行；现在看法变了，小型合成氨厂既好建又好用！”
    代表们实地参观后，会议正式开幕。化工部副部长侯德榜致开幕词说：这次会议的目的是响应中央号召，反右倾，鼓干劲，在化肥工业方面更好地贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针。化肥生产是当代比较年轻的一门工业，我国原有的基础十分薄弱；过去几年的大跃进，虽然产量不断猛增，但是仍然远远满足不了农业需要。新出现的小型合成氨厂，为我国更高速度地发展氮肥生产，提供了一条雄健有力的腿；普遍推广以后，它可以在短时间内提供大量氮肥，支援农业生产。如果在最近期间全国每个县建设一座，生产的氮肥便够肥几亿亩土地，对于提前实现农业发展纲要规定的指标，有巨大的作用。
    经过几天讨论，到会代表进一步体会到：两条腿走路的方针，完全适用于发展化肥工业。会上，代表们还确定了推广小型合成氨厂的步骤：首先抓紧时间，尽快把化工部已安排制造的三十五套小型合成氨厂的设备，在各省市安装起来，当作“样板厂”，从中取得经验；然后，再大批推广。
    关于建设小型合成氨厂必需的物质条件，会议也作了安排。
    参加这次会议的，有国家计委、经委、科委的代表，以及各省市和有关科学研究部门大专学校的代表。
