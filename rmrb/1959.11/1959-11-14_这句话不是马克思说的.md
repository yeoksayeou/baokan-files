    This Sentence Was Not Said by Marx
    In the article "On Talent and Learning" by Comrade Tuan Yin on the seventh page of the People's Daily on August 20th, it says: "People are all familiar with Marx's famous saying: 'Genius is diligence.' This is Marx's personal experience." As far as I know, this sentence was not said by Marx. Liebknecht said this in his article "Recollections of Marx": "'Genius is diligence,' someone once said. If this is not completely correct, it is at least largely correct." I hope the author will pay attention to the correctness of quotations in the future, especially when quoting the words of Marxist classic writers.

### 这句话不是马克思说的

    这句话不是马克思说的
    人民日报8月20日第七版上湍音同志写的“谈才能与学习”一文中说：“人们都熟知马克思的一句名言：‘天才就是勤奋’。这是马克思的切身经验。”就我所知，这句话不是马克思说的。李卜克内西在“忆马克思”一文中就这样说：“‘天才就是勤奋’，曾经有人这么说过。如果这话不完全正确，那至少在很大限度上是正确的。”希望作者今后注意引文的正确性，特别是引用马克思主义经典作家的话。
