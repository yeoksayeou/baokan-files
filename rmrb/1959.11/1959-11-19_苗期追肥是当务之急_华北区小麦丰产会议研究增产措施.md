Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th. The North China Wheat Bumper Harvest Professional Conference, through comprehensively summarizing and exchanging experiences in wheat bumper harvests this year, has put forward a set of measures to increase wheat production.

    The conference believes that to strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year, we should start with ensuring the safe overwintering of winter wheat and meeting the needs of fertilizer and water in the seedling stage, requiring wheat to have a certain number of tillers before winter. This year, soil moisture at sowing time in most areas of North China was good, and the main measure at present is topdressing in the seedling stage. Experimental research data from various regions have proved that topdressing in the seedling stage has a great effect on increasing production. The habit of covering "mengtou fei" (overwintering fertilizer) or applying "nuangou fei" (warm ditch fertilizer) in winter in northern Hebei and north of central Shanxi has a significant effect on preventing drought and protecting seedlings. Winter watering is most suitable at the time when the wheat fields freeze in the early morning and thaw at noon before winter.

    After the wheat fields are frozen in winter, the soil expands and the ground is prone to cracks, and tillering is vulnerable to frost damage. Except for sandy land, saline-alkali land, and low-lying wet land, rolling should be carried out to compact the topsoil, eliminate soil gaps, and protect seedlings from the cold. After the wheat turns green, because of the dry and windy spring in North China, moisture evaporates quickly, and wheat seedlings are prone to frost damage. Early spring rolling of wheat and harrowing the fields against the sun should be carried out as early as possible to increase soil temperature, loosen the topsoil, and reduce moisture evaporation.

    Wheat needs a lot of nutrients in the early stage of growth, and an appropriate amount of fast-acting fertilizer should be applied as topdressing. In wheat fields with insufficient soil moisture, spring irrigation should be carried out in a timely manner. During the wheat jointing stage, time should be seized to irrigate the "jointing water." In the middle and southern parts of North China in mid-to-late April and in the northern part in mid-to-late May, there are occasional late frosts, and irrigation before frost has the effect of preventing frost damage. The closer the irrigation date is to the frost period, the better.

    The conference also summarized many technical measures for wheat late-stage management.

    苗期追肥是当务之急
    华北区小麦丰产会议研究增产措施
    据新华社太原17日电　华北区小麦丰产专业会议通过全面总结交流今年小麦丰产经验，提出了一套小麦增产措施。
    会议认为争取明年小麦大丰收，目前应从保证冬小麦安全越冬做起，满足苗期肥水的需要，要求小麦冬前有一定数目的分蘖。今年华北大部分地区小麦播种墒情良好，目前主要措施是苗期追肥。各地试验研究资料证明，苗期追肥增产效果很大。河北北部和晋中以北地区冬季盖蒙头肥或施暖沟肥的习惯，对防旱保苗都有显著效果。冬浇以入冬前麦田早冻午消的时间最为适宜。
    冬季麦田封冻之后，土壤膨胀地面容易裂缝，分蘖时易遭冻害，除砂地、盐碱地和下湿地外，应进行镇压，使表土落实，排除土壤空隙，防寒保苗。小麦返青以后，因华北地区春季干旱多风，水分蒸发快，麦苗易遭受冻灾，应及早进行早春压麦，顶凌耙地，以便提高地温；疏松表土，减少水分蒸发。
    小麦生长前期需要大量养分，应适量的追施速效性肥料。墒情不足的麦田里，还应及时进行春灌。小麦拔节期应抓紧时间灌浇拔节水。华北地区中南部在4月中下旬和北部在5月中上旬，时有晚霜出现，霜前灌水有防冻的效果，灌水日期离霜期越近越好。
    小麦后期管理，会议也总结了许多技术措施。
