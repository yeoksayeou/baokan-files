Pig Prosperity and Grain Abundance
In Cangxi County, Sichuan, located in the Dabashan Mountains in northern Sichuan, there is the Baishan People's Commune with a thousand households and ten thousand pigs. This area is 1,300 meters above sea level, and although it is characterized by high mountains, deep gullies, and poor soil, with a low level of production, grain harvests have been abundant year after year since liberation in 1949. In terms of yield per unit area: the average grain yield per mu was only 222.5 jin in 1949, rising to 918 jin in 1958, and then leaping to 1,318 jin in 1959. In terms of total output: it increased by 46.2% in 1958 compared to 1957, and increased again by 40.7% in 1959 compared to 1958. This year, the average grain per person is 1,874 jin, of which fine grains account for 1,161 jin. The average income from agricultural and sideline production reached 182.8 yuan per person.

The substantial increase in grain production in 1959 was due to the People's Commune promoting the great development of pig raising. According to statistics at the end of October: the entire commune, with 1,292 households and 6,958 people, raised 14,259 pigs, of which 80.42% were publicly owned and raised, 11.1% were publicly owned and privately raised, and 8.48% were privately owned and privately raised, averaging 11.03 pigs per household and more than two pigs per person. Compared with before the establishment of the commune (end of September 1958), each household had a net increase of 4.53 pigs, an increase of 69.69%. The commune's pigs not only developed quickly but also achieved stable breeding and growth.

The entire commune has 11,248 mu of cultivated land, averaging one pig for every 0.79 mu of cultivated land. Where there are more pigs, there is more production. Take the Hongmiao Management District as an example. According to statistics in October 1959, the number of pigs increased by 1.31 times compared with the same period in 1958. In 1958, this management district applied an average of 5,262 jin of pure pig manure per mu of cultivated land, and the average grain yield per mu was 883.8 jin. In 1959, an average of 12,166 jin of pure pig manure was applied per mu of cultivated land, and the average grain yield per mu was 1,320 jin.

More pigs raised mean more fat pigs sold, contributing greatly to the country. From January to September 1959, the entire commune had already sold 1,373 fat pigs, accounting for 206% of the annual sales target assigned by the state. Compared with the same period in 1958, it increased by 56%. The commune plans to sell another 1,200 fat pigs to the state in the fourth quarter of this year.

More pigs sold mean more accumulation for the commune and more income for the commune members. In the Baishan Commune, the proportion of commodity production income in 1959 has reached 49.04% of the total income, of which pigs account for 33.43% of the commodity production portion. It is estimated that the total income from selling pigs and the bonuses issued by the state for overfulfilling the task of transferring pigs out of the province in 1959 is equivalent to 68.8% of the total annual wages of the entire commune. Calculated according to the 2,764 standard laborers in the entire commune, an average of 73.5 yuan can be obtained per person. From pigs alone, the total public accumulation of the entire commune can reach 30,475 yuan. One hundred percent of the commune members increased their income.

More pigs raised also mean more meat for the commune members to eat. All 157 canteens in the commune eat meat two to three times a month. The elderly, weak, sick, disabled, and pregnant women can eat even more meat. The cured meat from 1958 has not yet been finished. Every canteen has cured meat, and commune members also have cured meat stored at home.

The commune members say: Pigs are both a "fertilizer factory" and a "treasure bowl."

The Commune Paves the Way for Large-Scale Pig Raising
Before liberation, there were very few pigs raised here. In 1949, the entire township, with more than 1,200 households, only raised more than 500 pigs, averaging less than half a pig per household; 804 peasant households could not afford to raise pigs. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government led the masses to vigorously develop pig raising, using mutual aid and loans to help poor households solve their difficulties. By the autumn of 1956 (the early stage of advanced collectivization), it had developed to an average of 3.96 pigs per household. By the autumn of 1957, the number of pigs had increased to an average of 5.46 per household.

After the number of pigs increased significantly, the situation of raising pigs by individual households was no longer adapted to the needs of accelerating agricultural production for labor; therefore, many commune members requested to build some pigsties for collective pig raising, with specialized personnel, saving labor and time, without interfering with agricultural production or pig raising. In the spring of 1958, the General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China in Baishan Township, in accordance with instructions from higher authorities and the demands of the masses, vigorously developed publicly owned and publicly raised pigs, while also encouraging commune members to raise pigs privately. In this way, the number of pigs increased even faster. By September 1958, it had developed to 8,398 pigs, of which the proportion of publicly owned and publicly raised pigs reached 50%.

In 1958, agricultural production made a comprehensive leap forward, and the high-speed development of pig raising was also very important. However, agricultural cooperatives had few people and little funds, making it difficult to solve some problems in large-scale pig raising in a short period of time (such as pig sources, raw materials for building pigsties, and technical strength, etc.). At that time, there were still half of the total number of pigs being raised privately by individual households. In the situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production, commune members also felt that scattered raising wasted labor and was detrimental to agricultural production; at the same time, they saw with their own eyes that publicly raised pigs developed faster and better than privately owned pigs, so they urgently demanded that pigs enter the cooperative and be raised collectively. After the establishment of the commune, it met the demands of the masses, priced the pigs that commune members voluntarily contributed to the commune at a reasonable price, and changed private ownership to public ownership. The commune, in the spirit of walking on two legs, implemented the policy of focusing on publicly owned and publicly raised pigs, supplemented by publicly owned and privately raised pigs, and also allowed privately owned and privately raised pigs; it also adopted methods such as basing on production teams, centering on canteens, and establishing some larger-scale pig farms by the commune and management districts, vigorously developing pig raising. In the process of development, the commune made unified arrangements for the production plans, labor, pig sources, feed, and pigsties of each management district, quickly solving a series of problems that advanced agricultural production cooperatives found difficult to solve.

First, the labor problem was solved. Before the establishment of the commune, there were a total of 8,398 pigs in the entire township, occupying 1,572 people, averaging 5.3 pigs per person. After the establishment of the commune, more than 80% of the pigs were publicly owned and raised, and specialized personnel were implemented, improving labor efficiency. According to statistics in October 1959, the number of pigs had increased to 14,259, but there were only 554 feeders, averaging 25.7 pigs per person, reducing the number of pig raisers by 1,018.

Second, because the commune could plan production in a wider range, it was able to develop sows and boars more systematically and better implement the policy of self-breeding. After the establishment of the commune, the number of sows increased from 636 in 1958 to 1,094; the number of boars increased from two to twenty-nine.

Third, the feed problem was better solved. After the establishment of the commune, the feeders both raised pigs and planted feed, and the output of feed increased by an average of 1.5 times. After the vast majority of pigs were publicly owned and raised, fuel was also greatly saved. Previously, there were 1,292 stoves for cooking feed, but now only 237 stoves are needed.

Fourth, the pigsty problem was better solved. The commune made unified arrangements for labor, adopting a method that combined organizing professional teams and the masses. Within a month, 868 new large and medium-sized pigsties were built, and all the scattered and small old pigsties were renovated and expanded. The current pigsties are high, with deep pits, facing the sun and sheltered from the wind, and convenient for manure removal. The pigsties are dry. The construction of pigsties is rationally laid out according to the needs of production, saving labor for transporting fertilizer.

Fifth, the backward management districts quickly caught up with the advanced management districts. The commune used methods such as adjusting pig sources, increasing the construction of pigsties, and exchanging experiences to ensure that all management districts, except for the Feifeng Management District, which averaged only 9.7 pigs per household, averaged around eleven pigs per household. In the Zhaiya Management District, which was relatively backward in pig raising, the number of pigs increased from an average of five pigs per household in September 1958 to 10.48 in September 1959, an increase of more than double.

While vigorously developing publicly owned and publicly raised pigs, the commune distributed a small number of publicly owned pigs to commune members for raising in some production teams where centralized feeding conditions were not yet available. For publicly owned and privately raised pigs, the production team was responsible for the pig capital, and the commune members were responsible for solving the feed. When selling, after deducting the pig capital, the remaining cash income was divided by the production team, taking 20% to 30%, and the commune members taking 70% to 80%; most of the fertilizer was used by the production team, and a small portion was used by the commune members themselves.

Scientific Feeding Produces Fat Pigs and Many Piglets
The process of the great development of pig raising in the Baishan Commune is both a process of continuous struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking and a process of deeply carrying out mass movements. In the winter of 1958, the commune Party committee, based on the development of production and the demands of the commune members, proposed a plan to develop pigs to an average of ten per household in 1959. At this time, some people with right-leaning conservative thinking expressed doubts, saying: "Raising pigs is good, but there is a lack of feed," "Raising an average of six or seven pigs per household is the limit. Raising ten pigs per household is impossible even for living gods," "Rural production is busy, and labor is tight. There is no time to take care of raising pigs." The commune Party committee found the advanced example of the Qinglong Management District, where the number of pigs had developed to 10.46 per household, organized the masses to visit and discuss, and used this vivid fact to break down conservative thinking. It also discussed among the masses the favorable conditions for accelerating the development of pigs after the establishment of the People's Commune; among the cadres, it discussed the methods of grasping both agricultural production and pig raising. The cadres and the masses were very determined, and everyone contributed ideas and suggestions. The entire commune set off a wave of "learning from Qinglong, catching up with Qinglong, and surpassing Qinglong."

In order to further strengthen the leadership over pig raising production, the Baishan Commune Party Committee sent cadres at all levels in charge of pig raising to pig farms to participate in pig raising and lead pig raising; all cadres implemented "one unity, two packages, three looks, and four abilities." "One unity" means that agricultural production and pig raising are uniformly arranged and uniformly checked and compared. "Two packages" means that cadres are divided into areas and teams, contracting both agricultural production and pig raising. "Three looks" means that when going to the pigsty, one must see if the pigs are sick; see if the pigsty is clean and disinfected, and see if the pigs are full. "Four abilities" means being able to prevent diseases, treat diseases, raise pigs, and prepare feed. Now many cadres can prevent and treat common pig diseases; all cadres are in charge of both agricultural production and pig raising; they walk in the fields to check production, and also walk to the pigsties to check pig raising; sometimes they focus on storming agricultural production, and sometimes they focus on storming pig raising; pig raising and agricultural production are closely integrated. In order to further gain experience and set an example, most cadres in charge of pig raising have experimental fields such as "thousand-jin pigs," "300,000-jin feed land," and "disease-free pigsties."

The political quality and scientific and technical level of the feeders are the key to determining whether pigs can be raised well. Some cadres did not pay enough attention to this work in the past, and some even thought that "raising pigs is a small matter, and it can be raised well without leadership." After the establishment of the commune, the political leadership of the feeders was further strengthened, and the feeders were organized to conduct regular political studies. The communist style of not talking about conditions, not calculating rewards, and working selflessly was promoted among the feeders; a competition for increasing production and practicing economy was launched, with the management district as the unit, comparing once every seven days, and with the commune as the unit, comparing once every half month. Whenever heroic model meetings are held, model feeders participate in the presidium of the meeting.

The ideological awareness of the feeders has been improved, and they have shown initiative and creativity in all aspects. In order to change the phenomenon that feeding was separated from production and collecting feed in the past, the feeders proposed the "three-in-one" method: being able to raise pigs, being able to produce and collect feed, and being able to see diseases. Professional feeders were closely combined with the masses to launch a movement to increase the planting of feed and collect wild feed, achieving "melons, beans, and peas everywhere, feed planted on the edges of fields, and green all year round on the mountains and fields." The feeders also summarized the inherent pig raising experience of the peasants and adopted methods such as "feeding pigs diligently" to fatten pigs with less grain, feeding three or four times a day, and sometimes feeding once at night; the feed was cooked thoroughly, cut finely, and washed clean; large and small pigs were raised separately. All the feeders made a vow of "not giving up until pig plague is eliminated," and strictly implemented epidemic prevention measures: universally disinfecting around pigsties; often sprinkling lime and disinfectant; often disinfecting pig troughs with boiling water, and cleaning the pen boards at any time; using cypress branches to drive away mosquitoes and flies, so that the pigsties are not dirty or smelly; feeding pigs with five-flavor epidemic prevention medicine every one to five days.

In this way, cadres, feeders, and the masses worked together to create the miracle of no pigs dying of illness in more than a year since the establishment of the commune, and realized the leap forward plan for the high-speed development of pig raising. People with right-leaning conservative thinking had to bow their heads and admit defeat.

    既是“造肥厂”又是“聚宝盆”
    ——四川苍溪县白山人民公社养猪情况调查
    四川日报编辑部调查组
    猪多粮丰
    在四川北部大巴山上的苍溪县，有一个千户万猪的白山人民公社。这儿海拔一千三百米，尽管山高沟深，土质瘦薄，生产水平低下，但从1949年解放以后，粮食连年丰收。从单位面积产量看：1949年粮食平均亩产只有二百二十二斤半，1958年上升到九百一十八斤，1959年一跃为一千三百一十八斤。从总产量看：1958年比1957年增加了46.2％，1959年又比1958年增加了40.7％。今年粮食平均每人一千八百七十四斤，其中细粮占一千一百六十一斤。农副业收入平均每人达到一百八十二元八角。
    1959年粮食大幅度增产，是由于人民公社促进了生猪大发展。据10月底的统计：全公社一千二百九十二户、六千九百五十八人，就养了一万四千二百五十九头猪，其中公有公养的占80.42％，公有私养的占11.1％，私有私养的占8.48％，平均每户有十一点零三头猪，平均每人有两头多。与建立公社前（1958年9月底）比较，每户净增加了四点五三头，增长了69.69％。公社的猪，不仅发展快，而且作到了稳定地繁殖和增长。
    全公社一万一千二百四十八亩耕地，平均每七分九厘耕地就有一头猪。哪里养猪多，哪里增产多。以红庙管理区为例，据1959年10月统计，生猪比1958年同期增加了一点三一倍。1958年，这个管理区平均每亩耕地施净猪粪五千二百六十二斤，粮食平均亩产八百八十三点八斤。1959年平均每亩耕地施净猪粪一万二千一百六十六斤，粮食平均亩产为一千三百二十斤。
    养猪多，卖的肥猪也多，对国家的贡献大。全社从1959年1月到9月，已出售肥猪一千三百七十三头，为国家分配全年出售任务的206％。与1958年同期相比，增加了56％。公社计划在今年第四季度再卖一千二百头肥猪给国家。
    卖的猪多，公社积累多，社员收入多。白山公社1959年商品生产收入的比重已占到总收入的49.04％，其中猪占商品生产部分的33.43％。预计全社1959年卖猪款及国家发给的超额完成生猪外调任务的奖金，相当于全社全年工资总额的68.8％，按全社二千七百六十四个标准劳动力计算，平均每人可得七十三点五元。仅猪一项，全社公共积累可达三万零四百七十五元。百分之百的社员增加了收入。
    养猪多，社员吃肉也多。全社一百五十七个食堂，每月吃肉二至三次，老、弱、病、残、产妇还能多吃一些肉。1958年的腊肉，到现在还没有吃完，个个食堂都有腊肉，社员家里也存有腊肉。
    社员们说：猪是“造肥厂”，又是“聚宝盆”。
    公社为大量养猪开辟道路
    解放前，这里养猪很少。全乡一千二百多户人，1949年只养了五百多头猪，平均每户不到半头；有八百零四户农民喂不起猪。解放后，党和人民政府领导群众大力发展生猪，用互助和贷款等办法帮助贫苦户解决困难，1956年秋（高级合作化初期），就发展到平均每户养猪三点九六头。到1957年秋天，猪增加到平均每户五点四六头。
    猪大量地增加以后，一家一户喂猪的情况，已不适应加速发展农业生产对劳动力的需要；因此，好些社员要求修一些猪圈来集体养猪，专人专业，省人省事，不误农业生产，又不误养猪。中共白山乡党总支委员会在1958年春，根据上级指示和群众要求，大力发展公有公养猪，同时也鼓励社员私人养猪。这样，猪增加得更快了。1958年9月，就发展到八千三百九十八头，其中公有公养猪的比重达到了50％。
    1958年，农业生产全面大跃进，高速度发展养猪事业也显得十分重要了。但是农业社人少资金少，很难在较短的时间内解决大规模养猪中的一些问题（如猪源、修圈的原材料和技术力量等）。当时还有占总数一半的猪是一家一户私人喂养，在农业生产大跃进的情况下，社员也感到分散喂养浪费劳动力，对农业生产不利；同时亲眼看见公养猪比私有猪发展得又快又好，所以迫切要求生猪入社，集体喂养。公社成立后，满足了群众的要求，用合理的价格把社员自愿归社的生猪折了价，变私有为公有。公社本着两条腿走路的精神，贯彻了生猪以公有公养为主，公有私养为辅，并且允许私有私养的方针；还采取了以生产队为基础，以食堂为中心，公社和管理区建立一部分较大型的养猪场等办法，大力发展养猪事业。在发展过程中，公社对各个管理区的生产计划、劳力、猪源、饲料和猪圈作了统一安排，迅速地解决了高级农业生产合作社难以解决的一系列问题。
    第一、解决了劳力问题。公社建立前，全乡共有猪八千三百九十八头，占用一千五百七十二人，平均每人喂五点三头猪。公社建立后，80％以上的猪都是公有公养的，实行了专人专业，提高了劳动效率。据1959年10月统计，生猪已发展到一万四千二百五十九头，饲养员仅五百五十四人，平均每人养猪二十五点七头，减少了一千零一十八个养猪的人。
    第二、由于公社能够在更大范围内统一筹划生产，因而能够更有计划的发展种母猪和种公猪，更好地贯彻了自繁自养的方针。公社建立后，种母猪由1958年的六百三十六头增加到一千零九十四头；种公猪由两头增加到二十九头。
    第三、更好地解决了饲料问题。公社建立后，饲养员一面养猪，一面种饲料，饲料的产量平均增长了一倍半。生猪绝大部分公有公养后，还大大节省了燃料，以前有一千二百九十二个灶煮饲料，现在只要二百三十七个灶就够了。
    第四、更好地解决了猪圈问题。公社统一安排劳动力，采取组织专业队和群众相结合的办法，在一个月内新修大型和中型的猪圈八百六十八间，并将过去分散和小型的旧猪圈全部进行了改建扩建。现在的猪圈都是圈高坑深，向阳背风，排粪便利，猪圈干燥。修建猪圈是按照生产上的需要合理布局，节省了运肥的劳力。
    第五、养猪落后的管理区很快地赶上了先进的管理区。公社用调剂猪源，增修猪圈，交流经验等办法，使全社除飞凤管理区平均每户只有九点七头猪外，其他管理区平均每户都在十一头左右。在养猪上比较落后的寨丫管理区，由1958年9月平均每户五头，到1959年9月上升至十点四八头，增加了一倍多。
    公社在大力发展公有公养猪的同时，在集中饲养条件尚不具备的某些生产队，把少数公有猪分散给社员喂养，公有私养一律由生产队出猪本，由社员自己解决饲料，出卖时，除掉猪本外，其余的现金收入按生产队分二成到三成，社员分七成到八成；肥料大部分归生产队使用，小部分由社员自用。
    饲养科学猪肥仔多
    白山公社生猪大发展的过程，既是和右倾保守思想不断作斗争的过程，又是深入开展群众运动的过程。1958年冬，公社党委根据生产发展和社员的要求，提出了在1959年实现生猪平均每户发展到十头的计划。这时，个别有右倾保守思想的人表示怀疑，他们说：“养猪好是好，就是缺饲料”，“每户平均养猪六、七头就到顶了，每户养十头猪，就是活神仙也做不到”，“农村生产忙，劳力紧，那里顾得上养猪”。公社党委找出了青龙管理区的猪已发展到每户十点四六头的先进范例，组织群众参观和讨论，运用这一活生生的事实，打破了保守思想。又在群众中讨论了人民公社建立后加速发展猪的有利条件；在干部中讨论了既抓农业生产又抓养猪的方法问题。干部和群众决心很大，人人献计献策，全公社掀起了“学青龙、赶青龙、超青龙”的热潮。
    白山公社党委为了进一步加强对养猪生产的领导，把各级管生猪的干部下放到猪场，参加养猪，领导养猪；所有的干部都实行了“一统、两包、三看、四能”。“一统”，即农业生产和养猪统一布置，统一检查评比。“两包”，即干部划片分队，既包干农业生产，也包干养猪。“三看”，即到猪圈要看猪是否有病；看猪圈是否清洁和消过毒，看猪吃得饱不饱。“四能”，即能防病，能治病，能饲养，能调制饲料。现在很多干部都能防治普通的猪病；所有的干部都是又管农业生产，又管养猪；走在田间检查生产，也走到猪圈检查养猪；有时着重突击农业生产，有时着重突击养猪；养猪和农业生产紧密结合起来了。为着进一步取得经验，做出样子，大部分专管养猪的干部都有“千斤猪”、“三十万斤饲料地”、“无病猪圈”等试验田。
    饲养员的政治质量和科学技术水平，是决定猪能否养好的关键。有些干部对这一工作原来注意不够，甚至有个别干部认为“养猪是小事情，不用领导也能养好”。公社建立后，对饲养员进一步加强了政治领导，组织饲养员进行了经常性的政治学习，在饲养员中发扬了不讲条件，不计报酬，忘我劳动的共产主义风格；开展了增产节约竞赛，以管理区为单位，七天评比一次，以公社为单位，半月评比一次，每逢开群英大会，都有模范饲养员参加大会主席团。
    饲养员的思想觉悟提高了，在各个方面表现了主动性和创造精神。为了改变过去饲养与生产和采集饲料脱节的现象，饲养员提出了“三合一”的办法：能养猪、能生产和采集饲料，能看病。专业的饲养员和群众紧密结合，开展了增种饲料和大采野生饲料的运动，做到了“瓜瓜豆豆到处有，田边地角种饲料，满山遍野四季青”。饲养员还总结了农民固有的养猪经验，采用了“勤喂猪”等少用粮食喂肥猪的办法，每天喂三次、四次，有时夜间还喂一次；饲料煮熟、切细、淘净；大猪小猪分群饲养。全体饲养员立下了“不消灭猪瘟不甘心”的誓言，严格实行防疫措施：普遍做到猪圈四周消毒；经常洒石灰和消毒药水；猪槽经常用开水消毒，圈板随时打扫干净；用柏枝驱散蚊蝇，使猪圈不脏不臭；每隔一至五天给猪吃五味防疫药。
    就是这样，干部、饲养员和群众在一起，创造了建立公社以后一年多来没有病死过一头猪的奇迹，实现了高速度发展生猪的跃进计划，有右倾保守思想的人只好低头认输了。
