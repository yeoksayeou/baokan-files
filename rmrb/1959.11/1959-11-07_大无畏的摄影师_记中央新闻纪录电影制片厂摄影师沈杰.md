A newsreel photographer, as a recorder of contemporary history, has filmed countless admirable, moving and inspiring films for the people of the whole country. Comrade Shen Jie, a photographer from the Central Newsreel Studio, with extraordinary courage, perseverance, and disregard for any sacrifice, has filmed many extraordinary shots for us. His heroic deeds are themselves admirable, moving and deeply touching.

Treading Through Glaciers and Thousand-Year Snow
In April 1958, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Mountaineering Team and the Qilian Mountains Geological Team jointly organized a mountaineering and exploration team to explore iron ore resources in Jingtieshan, Gansu. In order to record the first time that China's mountaineering movement directly served socialist economic construction, the Central Newsreel Studio decided to send Comrade Shen Jie and Comrade Ren Futang to accompany the mountaineering and exploration team to shoot a film.

Climbing snow mountains is a relatively arduous activity, requiring overcoming severe cold, adapting to the low air pressure of high mountains, traversing treacherous mountain roads where no one has ever been, and not being afraid of drastically changing harsh climates... In the past, some photographers from the Central Newsreel Studio who filmed mountaineering films had their health ruined, and some wavered ideologically. At that time, Shen Jie, a member of the Communist Youth League, did not consider these things; he was only thinking about the Party's cultivation and education and the people's entrustment, and he happily accepted the task.

The climb began. Because it was his first time climbing a high mountain, his body was untrained, and he lacked mountaineering knowledge and skills. When he put on his eight-pound mountaineering boots and carried his twenty-five-kilogram backpack, after taking a few steps, his legs felt weak, and he found it very difficult to take steps. However, when he saw other comrades moving forward tenaciously, and thought about his promise to the Party: "I must climb the main peak and bring back the film," he generated the strength to forge ahead bravely. For the first two days, he lowered his head and focused on lifting his legs, step by step, often falling behind. Three days later, he could lift his head and follow the footsteps of the comrades in front. He followed the mountaineering and exploration team wherever they went. Finally, he climbed the 5,100-meter-high Daolong Shangrui Peak and completed the filming task with Ren Futang. This time, Shen Jie lived in the snow mountains for a total of twenty-six days and climbed twelve snow mountains above 4,000 meters, completing the photography task and accumulating mountaineering experience.

In July 1958, the studio sent Comrade Shen Jie and Comrade Wang Ximao with the seventh team of the High Mountain Ice and Snow Utilization Research Team composed of Chinese mountaineers to Mount Shule, the main peak of the Qilian Mountains, to shoot a color documentary. When the main team was crossing the Shule River, Comrade Shen Jie took off his clothes, held the camera, and jumped into the icy water to shoot a set of brilliant shots. When the team members were crossing the snow bridge, he was suspended in an ice crevasse under the protection of Wang Ximao to take pictures. Because it was very cold in the ice crevasse, he was so frozen that he couldn't even speak clearly when he first came up. When the main peak was reached, they encountered a blizzard. The weather was extremely cold, the air pressure was very low, the air was thin, and breathing was difficult. Every step required great effort. In such harsh weather, they persevered in filming with tenacious will. After reaching the main peak, six of Shen Jie's fingers were frostbitten, Wang Ximao's hands were cut by ice, and the camera also broke. Should the filming stop here? No. When the team members were camping in the high mountains, they disregarded the fatigue and pain on their bodies and rushed down the mountain, back to the base camp, and worked all night using three broken cameras to assemble one good one. The next morning, they carried the machine back up the mountain and climbed another ice mountain over 5,000 meters to complete the filming task. This time, in addition to climbing the 6,305-meter main peak, Shen Jie also climbed three ice mountains above 5,000 meters, and together with Wang Ximao, he filmed the moving scenes of Chinese mountaineers (also scientific workers) overcoming numerous difficulties on the main peak of the Qilian Mountains to find new water sources for the people of the Northwest. The color film they shot was later named "Treading Through Glaciers and Thousand-Year Snow" and was presented as a gift film to last year's National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists.

In order to train Comrade Shen Jie, the Party sent him to the Tibetan Plateau for four months of training with the Chinese Mountaineering Team last November. In the severe cold of minus twenty degrees Celsius, he climbed the 6,200-meter Nyainqêntanglha Mountain. On one occasion, under the protection of comrades Wang Ximao and Li Zhenyu, he used ropes to hang in an ice crevasse to film the thrilling scenes of the team members jumping over the ice crevasse. Because it was too cold in the ice crevasse, his feet and fingers suffered minor frostbite. During the training process, the three of them jointly filmed nearly five thousand feet of color film material.

Risking Danger to Capture the Crimes of the Rebel Bandits
When the Tibetan rebel bandits launched a rebellion this March, Shen Jie was in Lhasa. He personally witnessed the rebel elements besieging the Tibet Work Committee, blockading the national defense highway, building fortifications, and harming innocent people, and he felt very angry. He actively requested permission from the leadership to go out and film the crimes of the rebel bandits.

On March 16, tension was high at the Potala Palace. Many windows were turned into fortifications by the rebel bandits, and countless light and heavy weapons were pointed at the Tibet Work Committee and the leading organs of the Tibet Military Region. Below the Potala Palace, the rebel elements were forcing women to gather for demonstrations. When Comrade Shen Jie and Comrade Zhao Minjun approached them from the road, the rebel bandits incited the women to shout and demonstrate at them. At that time, Shen Jie thought: staying on the road for too long might result in being shot by the rebel bandits; but returning would be ridiculed by the enemy. So, he called out to Zhao Minjun, and together they braved the danger of their lives and rushed into the venue where the rebel bandits launched the demonstration, and made a surprise filming of a batch of materials. When they quickly left the venue, they encountered some rebel bandit leaders riding horses and swaggering through the streets. He picked up the camera and quickly filmed their ugly faces.

On the morning of March 17, he and Zhao Minjun rode in an armored vehicle deep into an area only a few dozen meters away from the rebel bandits' fortifications, filming the rebel elements' crimes of building fortifications and blockading the national defense highway. At that time, the rebel bandits often shot at us, but the order from the Military Region Headquarters was: we are not allowed to return fire when the rebel bandits shoot at us; if our people are injured, we can only rush back quickly. The situation was dangerous. Comrade Shen Jie, encouraged by the heroic deeds of the veteran photographers in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the liberation of Yijiangshan Island, and other battles, was not afraid in his heart. The armored vehicle approached the rebel bandits' fortifications, but the camera with a telephoto lens could not work inside the vehicle. What to do? Only by risking one's life and sticking one's head out of the vehicle could the crimes of the rebel bandits be vividly recorded. Comrade Shen Jie did not hesitate at that time. He exposed half of his body, put the camera on the roof of the vehicle, disguised it with a black cloth bag, and started shooting at lightning speed as soon as the vehicle stopped. Zhao Minjun also poked his head out of the hole in the driver's platform and filmed with a small camera. When the comrades in the car warned Shen Jie that there were rebel bandits aiming at them, he suddenly pointed the camera at the aiming rebel bandits and made a surprise filming. Before the enemy could figure out what was going on, our dauntless photographers had already captured their criminal activities in the camera.

When the counterattack began, Comrade Shen Jie was active on the front lines and, together with other comrades, filmed some scenes of combat, surrender, and so on. As soon as the battle ended, he filmed the mosques, civilian houses, and the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Administration that were burned and damaged by the rebel bandits. The above-mentioned materials were mostly incorporated into the film "Quelling the Tibetan Rebellion," which became ironclad evidence of the rebel bandits' crimes. In the period after the Tibetan rebellion was quelled, he also participated in the filming of news themes such as "Celebrating the Victory of Quelling the Rebellion" and "Civilians Moving into New Homes," praising the new life of the Tibetan people.

No Amount of Difficulty Can Scare a Hero
Shortly after returning to Beijing from Lhasa, at the end of May, Comrade Shen Jie accepted a new task of going to Mount Muztagata in Xinjiang, known as the "Father of Ice Mountains," to shoot a color film of women creating a world mountaineering record. He was filled with joy and felt infinitely honored. He also knew that there would be many difficulties in completing this task: the mountain to be climbed this time was higher than before, he had not exercised for more than two months in Lhasa because he was busy with work, and his body was not as strong as before. Wang Ximao, who had worked with him in the past, could not climb the mountain due to illness, and Wang Ruihua, who had been newly assigned, was a mountaineering novice… No amount of difficulty can scare a hero. The encouragement and instructions of the Party branch secretary gave him more confidence and strength. Before leaving and after arriving in Kashgar, Shen Jie twice promised the Party: I will never give up until the task is completed!

Not long after this battle began, Shen Jie one day rode his horse alone to the shore of Kara Kul Lake, far away from the base camp, to film a distant view of Mount Muztagata. On the way back, the weather suddenly turned bad, with blizzards, thunder and lightning. Thunderbolts struck one after another above his head, and his clothes crackled when they rubbed against each other, and the roots of his hair stood on end. The horse refused to move and kept neighing. He fired a shot to send out a distress signal, but there was no response. At that time, Shen Jie had thought of temporarily putting down the machine and film to reduce some danger; but he was afraid that he would not be able to find the machine again, so he would not be able to carry out the work. The heroic image of the photographer who sacrificed his life to protect the machine in the past floated in his mind, and he finally decided to continue to carry the machine and move forward on horseback. He struggled like this for about two hours before escaping danger.

Moving from the 5,500-meter camp to the 6,200-meter camp was already a relatively difficult journey. Stopping to rest for ten minutes after traveling for about an hour. The mountaineers seized this precious moment to rest. That morning, the sky was clear and cloudless, and the weather was fine. In order to film more scenes, Comrade Shen Jie did not rest four times. When the comrades in his vanguard first team stopped to rest, he turned around to film the scene of the second team comrades climbing the mountain; when the second team caught up, he carried the machine and continued to move forward with the first team. By the afternoon, he felt quite tired, but the thought of "filming the best and most thrilling scenes to better complete the task assigned by the Party" encouraged him, and he continued to move forward with heavy steps. When he arrived at the 6,200-meter camp, the team members began to set up tents. In order to film the scenes of the team members marching in the wind and snow, he did not bring an ice axe and did not let others protect him, so he started filming. At that time, the wind and snow were fierce, and the snow covered the ice crevasse. He had just taken a few steps forward when he heard a crashing sound, and he fell into the bottomless ice crevasse. He quickly held the machine in his right hand and spread his hands and feet apart, hanging on the walls of the ice crevasse. When the comrades rescued him from this critical situation, and before he had time to rest, another comrade fell into the ice crevasse in front of him. The comrades immediately launched a rescue, and he immediately seized the opportunity to film this thrilling scene.

When he arrived at the 6,800-meter camp, the climate was uncertain, the wind and snow were fickle, and the temperature was always between minus twenty and thirty degrees Celsius. In order to shoot the film, Shen Jie often took off the outer layer of his down gloves and stood in the deep snow for a long time, and his hands and feet were slightly frostbitten. But he still gritted his teeth and followed the main team towards the main peak.

He arrived at the 7,200-meter camp. The team members were setting up tents in the blizzard, and he started filming again. The down gloves were too bulky and inconvenient to work with, so he took them off; a layer of ice and snow floated on the sunglasses, and he could not see the scene clearly, so he took them off. In just a few minutes, an unfortunate thing happened: his already frostbitten hands and feet completely lost consciousness; his eyes, which had been repeatedly damaged by strong snow light due to taking off his sunglasses several times, lost their vision. At that time, he lost the conditions to continue working!

Our heroic photographer did not lose heart because of this. He invited Comrade Shi Zhanchun of the mountaineering team (Comrade Wang Ruihua, who had been traveling with him, went down the mountain halfway due to illness) and explained in detail the plan for continuing the filming, and asked him to complete the final filming task of the film "Treading Through the Snow and Clouds to the Ice Mountain" on his behalf. In order to avoid affecting the number of people climbing the main peak, he did not request to be sent down the mountain immediately. It was not until the next day when the mountaineering heroes successfully returned from the 7,546-meter peak that he was escorted back to the base camp by two comrades.

The Party sent a plane to take him back to Beijing and sent him to the best hospital for treatment. Because his hands and feet were ulcerated, the doctor amputated nine toes and two finger joints; his eyes quickly recovered their vision, and his body basically recovered its health. The Party organization encouraged him and took care of him in every possible way in his life. Comrades wrote letters of condolence from all over the country, and the National Congress of Heroes invited him to be a special representative... He deeply felt the warmth of the Party, the warmth of the socialist family, and was always full of spirit and optimistic. After the amputation of his toes, he endured the pain and practiced walking, and now he can move without crutches. He is continuing to exercise his body tenaciously, striving to be discharged from the hospital as soon as possible and welcome the new combat tasks assigned by the Party.

    大无畏的摄影师——记中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄影师沈杰
    新闻电影摄影师，作为当代历史的记录人，为全国人民拍摄了无数可歌可泣生动感人的影片。中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄影师沈杰同志，就曾以非凡的勇气，坚韧的毅力，不惜任何牺牲，为我们拍摄了许多不寻常的镜头。他的英雄事迹本身，就可歌可泣，深切感人。
    踏破冰川万年雪
    1958年4月，全总登山队和祁连山地质队共同组织了一支登山勘察队，到甘肃的镜铁山去勘察铁矿资源。为了记录我国登山运动第一次直接为社会主义经济建设服务的情景，中央新闻纪录电影制片厂决定派沈杰同志和任福棠同志随登山勘察队去拍摄一部影片。
    登雪山是一项比较艰苦的活动，要战胜严寒，适应高山的低气压，走过从无人迹的艰险山道，不怕剧烈变化的恶劣气候……。中央新闻纪录电影制片厂过去拍摄登山影片的摄影师，有人身体累坏了，有人思想动摇了。共青团员沈杰当时没有考虑这些，他想的只是党的培养教育和人民的嘱托，愉快地接受了任务。
    开始登山了。由于是第一次登高山，身体未经锻炼，缺乏登山的知识和技术，当他穿上八斤重的登山鞋，背上二十五公斤的背包，开始走了几步，两条腿就发软，迈步相当吃力。但是，当他看看别的同志在顽强地迈进，想想自己对党的保证：“一定要登上主峰，把片子拍回来”，就产生了奋勇前进的力量。头两天，他低着头用力提起腿一步一步地数着走，还时常掉队。三天以后，就能抬起头来，跟着前面同志的足迹前进了。登山勘察队员走到哪里，他就跟到哪里。最后终于登上海拔五千一百米的道龙上瑞顶峰，和任福棠一起完成了拍摄任务。这次，沈杰总共在雪山里生活了二十六天，登上了四千米以上的雪山十二座，既完成了摄影的任务，也积累了登山的经验。
    1958年7月，厂里派沈杰同志和王喜茂同志随中国登山运动员组成的高山冰雪利用研究队第七队，到祁连山主峰——疏勒山去拍摄一部彩色纪录片。在大队横渡疏勒河的时候，沈杰同志脱掉衣服，举着摄影机，跳进寒冷刺骨的冰水里，拍摄了一组精采的镜头。当队员过雪桥的时候，他在王喜茂的保护下，垂吊于冰裂缝中进行拍摄。由于冰裂缝中很冷，刚上来的时候，他冻得连话都说不清楚了。登主峰正遇到暴风雪，天气酷寒，气压很低，空气稀薄，呼吸困难，每走一步都要付出很大的力气。在这样恶劣的天气里，他们以顽强的意志坚持了拍摄。登上主峰以后，沈杰有六个手指头冻伤了，王喜茂的手被冰划破了，摄影机也坏了。拍摄工作就此停下来吗？不能。当队员们在高山宿营的时候，他们就不顾身上的疲倦和疼痛，急速下山，赶回大本营，连夜用三台坏摄影机凑成一台好的，第二天一早又背起机器上山，登上另一座五千多米的冰山，完成了拍摄任务。这一次，沈杰同志除登上了六千三百零五米的主峰以外，还登上了三座五千米以上的冰山，和王喜茂一起，把我国登山运动员（也是科学工作者）在祁连山主峰克服重重困难，为西北人民寻找新水源的动人情景拍摄了下来。他们拍摄的这部彩色影片后来被命名为“踏破冰川万年雪”，作为献礼影片献给了去年的全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。
    党为了培养沈杰同志，去年11月又派他随中国登山队到西藏高原进行了四个月的锻炼。在零下二十多度的严寒里，他登上了六千二百米的念青唐古拉山。有一次，他在同行的王喜茂和李振羽二同志的保护下，用绳子吊在冰裂缝中拍摄了队员们跳过冰裂缝的惊险镜头。由于冰裂缝中太冷，脚和手指头都受到轻度的冻伤。在锻炼过程中，他们三个人共同拍摄了近五千呎的彩色片资料。
    冒险抢拍叛匪罪行
    今年3月，西藏叛匪发动叛乱的时候，沈杰正在拉萨。他亲眼看到叛乱分子围攻西藏工委，封锁国防公路，大修作战工事，残害无辜人民等罪恶活动，心里非常气愤。便主动向领导请求出去拍摄叛匪罪行。
    3月16日，布达拉宫上剑拔弩张，许多窗户被叛匪修成作战工事，无数的轻重武器指向西藏工委和西藏军区领导机关。布达拉宫下面，叛乱分子正在强迫妇女集合示威。当沈杰同志和赵民俊同志由公路上接近她们的时候，叛匪就煽动妇女向他们吼叫示威。当时沈杰想：在公路上停留太久，可能要挨叛匪的冷枪；返回去呢，会受到敌人的嗤笑。于是，他招呼了一下赵民俊，共同冒着生命的危险猛地闯进了叛匪发动示威的会场，突击拍摄了一批材料。当他们迅速离开会场的时候，正遇到一些叛匪头目骑着马耀武扬威地在大街上走过，他又拿起摄影机很快地把他们的丑恶嘴脸拍摄了下来。
    3月17日上午，他和赵民俊坐装甲车深入到离叛匪工事只有几十米的地带，拍摄叛乱分子大修工事、封锁国防公路的罪行。当时，叛匪时常向我们射击，可是军区司令部的命令是：叛匪打我们，不准还枪；打伤了我们的人，也只能赶快回来。情况是危险的，沈杰同志由于受到老摄影师们在抗美援朝战争、解放一江山岛等战役中英勇摄影事迹的鼓舞，心里并不害怕。装甲车驶近了叛匪的工事，但是装有望远镜头的摄影机不能在车内工作。怎么办？只有冒着生命的危险从车内伸出头去，才能把叛匪的罪行活生生地记录下来。沈杰同志当时毫不犹豫地露出半个身子，把摄影机架在车顶，用黑布袋伪装了一下，等车子一停住，就以闪电般的速度拍摄起来。赵民俊也从驾驶台的洞口探出头来，用小型摄影机拍摄。当车内的同志警告沈杰有叛匪在瞄准他们的时候，他又蓦地把摄影机指向瞄准的叛匪，突击进行拍摄，敌人还没有弄清楚究竟，我们的大无畏的摄影师已经把他们的罪恶活动摄入了镜头。
    反击开始，沈杰同志活跃在最前线，和其他同志一起拍摄了一些战斗、受降等场面。战事刚结束，他拍摄了叛匪焚毁打坏的清真寺、民房、青藏公路管理局等镜头。上述各种材料大都编入了“平息西藏叛乱”这一影片，成为叛匪罪行的铁证。西藏叛乱平息后的一段时间，他还参加拍摄了“庆祝平叛胜利”、“平民迁入新居”等新闻主题，歌颂了藏族人民的新生。
    困难再多吓不倒英雄
    从拉萨回到北京不久，5月底，沈杰同志接受了到号称“冰山之父”的新疆慕士塔格山，拍摄女子创造世界登山纪录的彩色影片的新任务。他满腹高兴，感到无上光荣。他也知道要完成这一任务困难很多：这次登的山比过去都高，在拉萨因为工作忙，有两个多月没有锻炼，身体不如以前健壮，过去跟他合作的王喜茂因病不能登山，新派来的王瑞华是个登山新手……。困难再多吓不倒英雄。党支部书记的勉励和指示，更给他增加了信心和力量。出发以前和到达喀什以后，沈杰两次向党保证：不完成任务，决不罢休！
    这场战斗开始不久，沈杰有一天单独骑马跑到远离大本营的卡拉湖畔，去拍摄慕士塔格峰的远景镜头。回来的路上，天气骤然变坏，暴风雪雷电交加，霹雳在头顶上一个接一个地劈下来，衣服一摩擦便“卜卜”作响，头发根也竖了起来。马不肯走了，一个劲儿嘶叫。鸣枪发出呼救信号，也没有回音。当时，沈杰曾经想把机器、胶卷暂时放下，以便减少些危险；但怕回头找不到机器，便无法进行工作。过去为保护机器而牺牲生命的摄影师的英雄形象浮上心头，他终于决定继续带着机器打马前进。就这样搏斗了大约两个小时，方才脱险。
    从五千五百米的营地向六千二百米的营地进发，已是一段比较艰难的行程。每行进大约一小时，停下来休息十分钟。登山运动员都抓紧这宝贵的时刻休息。这天上午万里无云，天气晴朗，沈杰同志为了多拍些片子，四次没有休息。他所在的先遣第一队的同志停下来休息，他就回过头去拍摄第二队同志登山的情景；第二队赶上来了，他又背起机器随第一队继续前进。到下午，他已感到相当累了，但是，“为了拍摄最好最惊险的镜头，更好地完成党交给的任务”这一念头鼓舞着他，他继续顽强地迈着沉重的脚步往前走。到六千二百米营地了，队员们动手搭帐篷。他为抢拍下面队员在风雪中行进的镜头，没有带冰镐，也没有让别人保护，就进行拍摄。当时风雪正猛，大雪复盖了冰裂缝，他刚往前走了几步，只听得呼隆一声，就向无底的冰裂缝陷下去。他赶紧把双手捧着的机器擎在右手，把手脚叉开来，梗悬在冰裂缝的两壁上。当同志们把他从这千钧一发的险境抢救出来，还没有休息一下，正赶上另一个同志掉进前面的冰裂缝里，同志们又展开营救，他马上便抓紧机会拍摄了这一惊险镜头。
    到达六千八百米营地时，气候阴晴不定，风雪无常，温度一直在零下二十度到三十度。沈杰为了拍电影，常常摘掉外面的一层鸭绒手套，同时在深雪里站得较久，手脚已有轻度冻伤。但他仍咬紧牙关，跟随大队向主峰进发。
    到达七千二百米营地了。队员们在暴风雪中搭帐篷，他又开始拍摄。鸭绒手套太肥大，工作不方便，他把它脱下来；墨镜上浮了一层冰雪，取景看不清，他把它摘掉了。仅仅几分钟，不幸的事情发生了：已经冻伤的手脚，完全失去了知觉；因几次摘掉墨镜，接连受到强烈雪光损伤的眼睛，失去了视觉。当时，他失去了继续工作的条件！
    我们英勇的摄影师，并没有因此而垂头丧气。他把运动健将登山队的史占春同志请来（同行的王瑞华同志半途因病下山了），详细交代了继续拍摄的计划，请他代为完成了“踏雪穿云上冰山”这部影片最后的拍摄任务。为了避免影响登上主峰的人数，他没有请求立即送他下山，等第二天登山英雄们登上海拔七千五百四十六米的顶峰胜利归来，他才由两位同志护送回大本营。
    党用飞机把他接回北京，送他进最好的医院治疗。由于手脚溃烂，医生给他截掉了九个脚趾和两节手指；两眼很快恢复了视觉，身体基本上恢复了健康。党组织勉励他，在生活方面无微不至地照顾他，同志们从四面八方写来慰问信，全国群英大会请他作特邀代表……。他深切地感到党的温暖、社会主义大家庭的温暖，始终精神饱满，情绪乐观。截去脚趾以后，他忍着疼痛练习走步，现在不扶拐杖已能行动。他正继续顽强地锻炼身体，争取早日出院，迎接党交给的新的战斗任务。
