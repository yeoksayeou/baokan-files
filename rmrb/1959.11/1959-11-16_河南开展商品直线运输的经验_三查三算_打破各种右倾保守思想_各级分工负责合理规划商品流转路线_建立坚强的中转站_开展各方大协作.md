    Report from this newspaper: Henan's Experience in Developing Direct Commodity Transportation
    Breaking Various Right-leaning Conservative Ideas through "Three Checks and Three Calculations"; Rational Planning of Commodity Circulation Routes through Division of Responsibilities at All Levels; Establishing Strong Transfer Stations; Conducting Large-scale Collaboration Among All Parties

    This newspaper reports: Developing direct commodity transportation is a complex and meticulous task. Over the past year, Henan Province has accumulated rich experience from practice.

    First, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party, implement politics in command, continuously criticize right-leaning conservative ideas, and unify understanding and action. Initially, some staff of the commercial bureau's management departments in some counties feared that they would have nothing to do after implementing direct transportation and direct settlement, and were concerned about not being able to complete profit targets and having difficulties with various expenditures. Some financial accounting personnel were afraid of messing up procedures, and some purchasing agents were afraid of trouble. When direct transportation achieved initial results, right-leaning conservative ideas such as "there is no more potential to be tapped" appeared. In response to these ideological situations, the Party committees of various commercial bureaus launched "three checks and three calculations" among employees: checking roundabout transportation and calculating losses and waste; checking business management and calculating cost savings; checking the implementation of the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and calculating the harm of right-leaning conservative ideas. The vast majority of employees clearly recognized the great significance of developing direct transportation and unified their thinking. Many regions' commercial departments have established specialized leadership organizations for developing direct transportation, grasping planning, grasping measures, grasping action, grasping effects, and grasping experience, and organizing red flag competitions, which has powerfully promoted the development of direct transportation work.

    Second, based on the principles of benefiting the rational circulation of commodities, benefiting greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and benefiting business management, examine the original commodity circulation routes from top to bottom, and plan new routes.

    The specific methods are: The prefectural commercial bureau is responsible for planning direct transportation on major transportation lines, so that bulk commodities do not pass through the prefectural and county links, but are directly transported to comprehensive stores. The county commercial bureau is responsible for planning direct transportation routes that do not pass through comprehensive stores, so that commodities are directly transported from the county commercial bureau to various retail departments and production brigades, and plans the direct transportation of relatively large-volume industrial and agricultural products produced and sold locally within the county, organizing face-to-face meetings between producers and sellers. Comprehensive stores are responsible for planning direct transportation routes that bypass various grassroots retail departments and go directly to various production teams and public canteens. Through comprehensive planning, level-by-level connection, and level-by-level implementation. In the process of planning, it is necessary to mobilize the masses and have everyone contribute ideas and suggestions. For the convenience of work, commodity transfer charts should be drawn to compare the distance of routes and choose the straight path over the winding one.

    Third, establish transfer stations at stations, docks, and larger commodity distribution centers on major transportation lines, so that goods do not stop at the station upon arrival, but are transferred directly from the station to various grassroots points within the county, and ensure that sound procedures and systems are in place.

    According to work needs, the transfer station should be staffed with strong full-time personnel by the county commercial bureau, and personnel for accounting, statistics, planning, and price management should be established. When necessary, warehouses should also be established and staffed with storage personnel.

    Now, the commercial departments in various parts of Henan have established a relatively complete set of operating procedures and management systems in terms of material distribution, price setting, and financial settlement based on the new situation of direct transportation, ensuring the consolidation and development of direct transportation.

    Finally, commercial departments should strengthen cooperation with transportation departments and maintain close ties with higher and lower levels and left and right sides. Commercial and transportation departments should hold regular or irregular collaboration meetings, and also meet frequently and maintain frequent contact in ordinary times. Commercial departments should also regularly and proactively report on material inventory and collection and transportation to the transportation departments. In the case of insufficient modern transportation equipment, vigorous efforts should be made to organize folk transportation equipment to participate in transportation and sign contracts with the transportation commune, so as to achieve quick loading, quick transportation, and quick unloading, and accelerate commodity circulation. In addition, commercial departments should strengthen ties with industrial, banking, and grain departments, as well as the commercial departments themselves at all levels.

    河南开展商品直线运输的经验
    “三查三算”打破各种右倾保守思想
    各级分工负责合理规划商品流转路线
    建立坚强的中转站　开展各方大协作
    本报讯　开展商品直线运输是一件复杂细致的工作，一年多来，河南省从实践中积累了丰富的经验。
    首先，要加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，不断批判右倾保守思想，统一认识，统一行动。最初，部分县商业局经理部的工作人员怕实行直线运输、直线结算以后无事可做、担心利润任务完不成，各项开支有困难。有的财务会计人员怕搞乱手续，有的采购员怕麻烦。在直线运输有了初步成绩的时候，又出现了“再无潜力可挖了”等右倾保守思想。各商业局党委针对这些思想情况，在职工中开展了“三查三算”；查迂回运输、算损失浪费；查经营管理，算节约费用；查执行多快好省总路线的情况，算右倾保守思想的危害。广大职工明确认识了开展直线运输的重大意义，统一了思想认识。许多地区的商业部门建立了开展直线运输的专门领导机构，抓规划，抓措施，抓行动，抓效果，抓经验，组织开展红旗竞赛，有力地推动了直线运输工作的开展。
    第二，本着有利商品合理流转，有利多快好省、有利经营管理的原则，自上而下地审查原来的商品流转路线，规划新的路线。
    具体作法是：专区商业局负责规划主要交通干线的直达直运，使大宗商品不经专区、县的环节，直运综合商店。县商业局负责规划不经综合商店，使商品从县商业局直运各门市部和生产大队的直运路线，并且规划全县内部就地产销的比较大宗的工农业产品就厂直运，组织产销见面。综合商店负责规划越过各基层门市部直达各生产小队和公共食堂的直运路线。通过全面规划，层层衔接，层层落实。规划过程中，要发动群众，人人献计献策。为了工作方便，应绘制商品调运图表，以便对比路程远近，弃弯取直。
    第三，在主要交通干线上的车站、码头和较大的商品集散地，建立中转站，以便货物到站不停，就站中转，直达县内各基层点，并要确保手续制度健全。
    根据工作需要，中转站应由县商业局配备强的专职人员，设立会计、统计、计划和管物价的人员，必要时还应建立仓库，设保管人员。
    现在，河南各地商业部门已根据直线运输的新情况，在物资分配、制定物价和财务结算等方面建立了一套比较完整的经营手续和管理制度，保证了直线运输的巩固和发展。
    最后，商业部门要加强同交通部门的协作，密切上下左右的联系。商业和交通部门要定期或不定期地召开协作会议，平时也要勤碰头，多联系。商业部门还要经常主动地向交通运输部门反映物资库存和集运情况。在现代运输工具不足的情况下，应大力组织民间运输工具，参加运输并同搬运公社签订合同，以便作到快装、快运、快卸，加速商品流转。此外，商业部门还要加强同工业、银行、粮食等部门以及商业部门本身上下左右的联系。
