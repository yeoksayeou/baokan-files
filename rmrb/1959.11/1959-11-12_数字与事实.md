Numbers and Facts
	More Pigs, More Fertilizer, More Grain
    The Dalu Brigade of the Mochuan Commune in Xing'an County, Guangxi, developed pig production, and three "mores" appeared in the entire brigade:
    More pigs: In 1956, this brigade had 681 pigs. In 1957, it developed to 884 pigs. In 1958, it reached 1,466 pigs. It is expected to reach 1,700 pigs by the end of this year.
    More fertilizer: In 1957, pig raising accumulated 36,000 dan of fertilizer, an average of 36 dan per mu. In 1958, pig raising accumulated 58,000 dan of fertilizer, an average of 40 dan per mu. This year, it is estimated that 68,000 dan of fertilizer will be accumulated, an average of 54 dan per mu.
    More grain production: As the amount of fertilizer applied increased year by year, coupled with other production-increasing measures, the unit area yield of grain also increased year by year. In 1956, the average yield per mu was 364 jin, in 1958, the yield per mu was 420 jin, and this year, the yield per mu was 510 jin.
    Deep Plowing Beats Shallow Plowing
    The first and third teams of the Shaxi Production Brigade of the Luobu Commune in Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, have the same natural conditions. The yields of rice, corn, and spring flowers have always been comparable. However, later, the first team started deep plowing, while the third team did not. The yields of the two teams then showed a considerable difference.
    In the autumn of 1956, the first team's deep plowing reached six to seven cun, and in 1957, the production of corn and rice increased by 10%. The third team still used shallow plowing, and in 1957, production remained at the original level.
    In 1957, the first team, due to its persistence in deep plowing, although it suffered a greater natural disaster in 1958, the average yield per mu was still 40 jin higher than that of the third team, which did not suffer from the disaster.
    In 1958, the entire brigade promoted deep plowing, but the captain of the third team still did not believe in the benefits of deep plowing. The "experimental plot" he planted himself was still plowed to a depth of four cun, and as a result, although other production-increasing measures were taken, the yield per mu was only 180 jin.
    Every Word is Worth a Thousand Pieces of Gold
    The Huangjing Production Team of Mianyang County, Hubei Province, has two cotton experimental fields with the same soil quality and the same natural conditions, but the yield per mu differs by more than one fold: the experimental field of female team leader Zhang Zhenyuan averaged 550 jin per mu, while the experimental field of work team leader Hu Yatou averaged 240 jin per mu.
    Why is the yield so disparate? The reason is that one person conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, while the other did not. The specific situations are compared as follows:
    Soil: Zhang's experimental field was deeply plowed to one chi, with loose soil layers, retaining moisture and fertilizer; Hu's experimental field was only plowed to five cun, which could not retain moisture and fertilizer.
    Fertilizer: Zhang's experimental field applied 500 dan of base fertilizer in layers, and followed the fertilizer application principles of "light fertilizer for seedlings, stable fertilizer for buds, heavy fertilizer for flowers, and ruthless fertilizer for bolls," applying four top dressings in a timely manner; Hu's experimental field only applied 200 dan of base fertilizer and two top dressings.
    Water: Zhang's experimental field, during the drought resistance period, irrigated three times according to the bud stage, flowering stage, and boll stage; Hu's experimental field only irrigated once.
    Seeds: Zhang's experimental field used pure seeds that were specially harvested and stored, and underwent sun drying, wind selection, and seed dressing with chemicals before sowing; Hu's seeds were mixed varieties, and only underwent wind selection once without chemical seed dressing before sowing.
    Density: Zhang's experimental field used wide-narrow row strip planting, averaging 3,530 plants per mu; Hu's experimental field used equal row strip planting, with 2,500 plants per mu.

　　数字与事实
    猪多、肥多、粮多
    广西兴安县谟川公社大路大队发展猪只生产，全队出现了三多：
    养猪多，一九五六年这个大队有猪六百八十一头，一九五七年发展到八百八十四头，一九五八年达到一千四百六十六头，到今年底预计可达到一千七百头。
    积肥多，一九五七年养猪积肥三万六千担，每亩地平均三十六担，一九五八年养猪积肥五万八千担，每亩平均四十担；今年预计积肥六万八千担，平均每亩五十四担。
    粮食产量多，施肥量逐年增加，再加上其它增产措施，粮食单位面积产量也逐年提高，一九五六年平均亩产三百六十四斤，一九五八年亩产四百二十斤，今年亩产五百一十斤。
    深耕胜浅耕
    浙江省金华县罗埠公社沙溪生产大队的第一小队和第三小队，自然条件一样，历年来水稻、玉米、春花产量都不差上下。但是后来第一小队开始了深耕，第三小队没有深耕，两个队的产量就有了不小的距离。
    一九五六年秋天，第一小队深耕达到六至七寸，一九五七年玉米、水稻增产了一成。第三小队仍然是浅耕，一九五七年生产停留在原来的水平上。
    一九五七年第一小队由于坚持了深耕，虽然在一九五八年遭受了较大的自然灾害，平均亩产量仍然比没有遭受灾害的第三小队增产四十斤。
    一九五八年全大队都推行了深耕，但是第三小队队长还不信服深耕的好处。他自己种的一丘“试验田”还是耕地四寸，结果虽然采取了其它增产措施，亩产只有一百八十斤。
    字字值千金
    湖北省沔阳县黄荆生产队有两块棉花试验田，土质一样，自然条件相同，亩产量却相差一倍多：妇女队长张珍元的试验田平均亩产五百五十斤；作业组长胡丫头的试验田平均亩产二百四十斤。
    为什么产量这样悬殊呢？原因是一个认真彻贯了农业“八字宪法”，一个没有贯彻“八字宪法”。具体情况对比如下：
    土：张的试验田深翻一尺，土层松软，保墒保肥；胡的试验田只翻了五寸，不能保墒保肥。
    肥：张的试验田分层施了五百担底肥，又根据苗肥轻、蕾肥稳、花肥重、桃肥狠的施肥原则，适时追了四道肥；胡的试验田只施了二百担底肥，追肥两次。
    水：张的试验田在抗旱的时候，按蕾期、花期、桃期分别灌了三次水；胡的试验田只灌了一次水。
    种：张的试验田用的是专收专藏的纯种，播种时经过了晒选、风选、药剂拌种；胡用的是杂种，播种时只风选一道，也没用药剂拌种。
    密：张的试验田是宽窄行条播，每亩平均三千五百三十株；胡的试验田是等行条播，每亩二千五百株。
