Preliminary Processing is Very Important

With thousands upon thousands of people going up into the mountains, news of the bumper harvest of wild plants is constantly coming in. How to promptly carry out preliminary processing of the collected wild plants, transport them to various factories and enterprises for further refining, and turn them into finished products is a crucial issue at present.

The real bumper harvest of wild plants is not only reflected in the collection of raw materials, but more importantly in the preliminary processing. Because there are many varieties of wild plants, transportation is difficult, and preservation is not easy. If the collected plants cannot be processed quickly, some products are in danger of deterioration. Therefore, collecting them can only be regarded as the beginning of a bumper harvest, and the real harvest still depends on rough processing, turning them into storable raw material finished products or semi-finished products.

Anhui fully mobilized the power of the people's communes to set up more than 3,000 wild plant preliminary processing plants, implementing on-site material collection and on-site processing, which has achieved great results. This practice is worth recommending to all regions.

    初制加工很重要
    成千上万人上山以后，野生植物的丰收消息不断传来。如何把采集起来的野生植物及时地初制加工，运送各工厂企业再作精制加工，变为成品，这是当前一个重要问题。
    野生植物的真正的丰收，不仅仅表现把原料采集起来，重要的表现在经过初制加工。因为野生植物品种很多，运输困难，保存也不容易。如果采集起来不能很快加工，那末，有些产品就有变质的危险。所以，采集起来只能算是丰收的开端，真正丰收还有赖于加工粗制，变为可以储存的原料成品或半成品。
    安徽充分动员人民公社的力量举办野生植物初制厂三千多座，实行就地取材，就地加工，收效很大。这种做法，值得向各地推荐。
