Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 8th November: Many Romanian industrial and mining enterprises have completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule this year, or have achieved annual production increase and savings guarantees.

The second iron smelting workshop of Romania's largest metallurgical enterprise, the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine, and the blast furnace workers and coking workers of the Resita Metallurgical Combine, all fulfilled their earlier guarantees to overproduce products for the year ahead of schedule by the end of October. They overproduced more than 30,000 tons of pig iron and more than 10,000 tons of coke for the country. Now, the competition between the steelworkers of these two factories is becoming increasingly intense, and they are making every effort to overproduce more than 100,000 tons of steel by the end of the year.

In the coal mining, petroleum and building materials industries, many units have also completed their annual production plans or increased production and savings guarantees. For example, the miners of Domai completed their annual production plan two and a half months ahead of schedule, reducing the cost of each ton of coal by 600 lei (Romanian currency). The Zemes oil drilling team in Bacau County has already saved more than 5.4 million lei and completed its annual savings plan. The "19th Party Congress" cement factory in Bicaz has completed its plan to overproduce cement for the entire year, overproducing more than 26,000 tons of cement.

Currently, employees of industrial and mining enterprises throughout Romania are continuing to deepen the socialist emulation drive, striving to achieve greater results in increasing production and practicing economy. Recently, the Central Council of Romanian Trade Unions convened inter-provincial conferences in Bucharest, Bacau, Crosh, and other cities to discuss the progress of completing this year's savings plan. Trade union workers and factory enterprise leaders who attended the meeting expressed their determination to overfulfill this year's savings guarantees and put forward many specific measures.

    深入开展社会主义劳动竞赛
    罗许多企业提前完成全年生产计划
    新华社布加勒斯特8日电　罗马尼亚许多工矿企业已经提前完成了今年全年的生产计划，或者实现了全年的增产节约保证。
    罗马尼亚最大的冶金工业企业——洪尼多阿拉冶金联合工厂的第二炼铁车间和累希擦冶金联合工厂的高炉工人、炼焦工人，都在10月底实现了他们早先提出的全年超计划生产产品的保证。他们共超计划为国家生产了三万多吨生铁和一万多吨焦炭。现在，这两个工厂的炼钢工人之间的竞赛愈来愈紧张，他们正在全力争取到年底超计划生产十万多吨钢。
    在采煤、石油和建筑材料工业部门中，也有许多单位完成了全年的生产计划或增产节约保证。例如，多迈的矿工提前两个半月完成了全年生产计划，使每吨煤的成本降低了六百列伊（罗币名）。巴科州的泽梅斯石油钻井队已经节约了五百四十多万列伊，完成了全年的节约计划。比卡兹的“第十九次党代表大会”水泥工厂已经完成了今年全年超计划生产水泥的计划，超计划生产了二万六千多吨水泥。
    现在，罗马尼亚各地工矿企业的职工还在继续深入展开社会主义竞赛，为在增产节约方面取得更大的成绩而斗争。最近，罗马尼亚工会中央理事会在布加勒斯特、巴科、克罗什等城市召集了州际会议，讨论了完成今年节约计划的情况。参加会议的工会工作者和工厂企业负责人在会议上表示一定要超额完成今年的节约保证，并且提出了许多具体措施。
