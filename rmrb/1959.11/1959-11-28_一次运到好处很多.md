    Shipping All at Once Has Many Benefits
    Henan Province has done a very good job in this year's summer and autumn grain transportation. The grain departments in this province adopted a method of rational allocation and one-time transportation, transporting the requisitioned grain from the people's communes or production brigades directly to transportation lines, supply points, processing factories, and warehouses for long-term storage, basically eliminating the phenomenon of first transferring it to state granaries nearby and then carrying out secondary short-distance collection and transportation.
    There are many benefits to rational allocation and one-time transportation. It combines requisitioning and transportation work; it can closely link short-distance transportation with trunk line transportation, ensuring sufficient grain supply along transportation lines, and enabling timely transportation. Adopting a rational allocation and one-time transportation method can also avoid and reduce the shortcomings of circuitous, opposing, and reverse flows in transportation; it can also reduce one loading and unloading procedure, greatly saving manpower and animal power, and reducing transportation costs. If the method of first transferring it to state granaries nearby and then collecting it for transportation to transportation lines, supply points, processing factories... is adopted as in the past, then adding an entry and exit from the warehouse will add another loading and unloading procedure, which will waste a lot of loading and unloading labor and even waste grain; in addition, indirect transportation is prone to detours and reverse flows... wasting transportation power. This year, Henan Province adopted a rational allocation and one-time transportation method, saving more than 18.66 million labor days, more than 12 million animal power trips, and more than 16 million yuan in transportation and miscellaneous expenses, which fully demonstrates that adopting rational allocation and one-time transportation is a good method.
    Judging from the experience of grain transfer and transportation in Henan Province: To transport grain directly to transportation lines, supply points, or processing factories... it is necessary to comprehensively arrange purchasing, sales, transfer, and storage as a basis and carefully formulate a grain allocation plan. When requisitioning summer and autumn grains this year, Henan Province firmly grasped this link. When formulating this year's grain allocation plan, this province first based itself on the principles of being conducive to supply, transportation, and storage, and referred to the state's grain allocation plan to formulate a preliminary plan, which was handed over to the people's communes to mobilize the masses for discussion and propose preliminary opinions. Then, the county grain bureau centralized the opinions of the masses, and after repeated research, determined the direction of grain transportation and formulated a rational allocation plan; then, the plan was implemented level by level to the communes and production brigades, and after discussion by the masses, each production brigade knew how much grain should be sold to the state and where to send it. This method of handing over the plan to the masses for discussion, concentrating the opinions of the masses to revise the plan, and then implementing the plan to make the plan the action of the masses is the working method of the mass line. This is an important key to ensuring grain requisitioning and rational transportation, and an important experience that Henan Province can achieve rational allocation and one-time transportation.
    Now is the peak season for grain requisitioning and also the busy season on the transportation front. The national grain requisitioning departments should universally promote the grain transportation experience of Henan Province, rationally allocate the large amount of requisitioned grain, and implement one-time transfer and transportation. In this way, not only can a lot of manpower, animal power, and transportation power be saved, but also the national grain transfer and transportation tasks can be completed more quickly, better, and more economically.

    一次运到好处很多
    河南省今年的夏秋粮食运输工作做得很好。这个省的粮食部门采用合理摆布一次运到的办法，把征购的粮食从各人民公社或生产大队一次运到交通沿线、供应点、加工厂和供长期贮备的仓库，基本上消除了先就近调入国家粮仓，然后再进行二次短途集运的现象。
    合理摆布一次运到的好处很多。它把征购工作和调运工作结合起来了；它可以使短途运输和干线运输紧密衔接，保证交通沿线的粮源充裕，可以及时调运。采用合理摆布一次运到的运输办法，还可以避免和减少迂回、相向、倒流运输的缺点；还可以减少一次装卸的手续，大大节约了人力、畜力，降低了运输费用。如果像过去那样采用先就近调进国家粮仓，然后再集运到交通沿线、供应点、加工厂……的办法。那末，多进出一次仓库就要多费一次装卸手续，就会浪费很多装卸劳动力甚至还会浪费粮食；再加上间接运送，往往容易发生迂回、倒流……浪费运输力量的毛病。河南省今年采用了合理摆布一次运到的办法，节省了劳力一千八百六十六万多个劳动日，畜力一千二百多万头次，运杂费用一千六百多万元，这充分说明了采用合理摆布一次运到是一个好办法。
    从河南省粮食调运的经验来看：要把粮食一次运到交通沿线、供应点或加工厂……等地方，就要以全面安排购、销、调、存作依据，周密地制定粮食摆布计划。河南省今年征购夏秋粮的时候，紧紧地抓住了这一环节。这个省在制定今年粮食摆布计划的时候，先本着有利于供应、调运和保管的原则，参照国家的粮食调拨计划，定出一个初步计划，交给人民公社发动群众进行讨论，提出初步意见，然后由县粮食局集中了群众的意见，经过反复研究，确定了粮食的运送方向，制定出合理的摆布计划；再把计划逐级落实到公社、生产大队，再经过群众讨论，使每个生产大队都知道应该向国家交售多少粮食，送到什么地方去。这种把计划交给群众讨论，集中群众的意见来修改计划，再把计划贯彻下去，使计划成为群众的行动的方法，是群众路线的工作方法。这是保证粮食征购和合理运输的重要关键，是河南省能够作到合理摆布一次运到的重要经验。
    现在正是征购粮食的旺季，也是运输战线上的繁忙季节。全国的粮食征购部门，应该普遍推广河南省的运粮经验，把征购的大量粮食进行合理的摆布，实行一次调运。这样，不但能够节省大量的劳力、畜力和运输力量，而且能够多快好省地完成全国的粮食调运任务。
