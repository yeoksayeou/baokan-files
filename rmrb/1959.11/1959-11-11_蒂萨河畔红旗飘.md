    Red Flag Flutters on the Tisza River
    By Our Correspondent Wang Chongjie
    When we arrived at the office of the Dancic Agricultural Production Cooperative on the east bank of the Tisza River, only the seventy-year-old man, Youreżoff, was intently typing, calculating the cooperative's various accounts.
    "The cooperative director, chief agronomist, Party branch secretary, and all the able-bodied people have gone to the fields to busy themselves with the autumn harvest and planting. Everyone wanted me to stay here to answer the phone, otherwise I would really want to go to the fields to do some work," Elder Youreżoff explained to us with a smile.
    "This year in August, the Solnok State Party Committee and the People's Council awarded our cooperative a red flag for being an excellent cooperative. In September, we won a special prize at the National Agricultural Exhibition. Everyone wants to make the crops grow even better next year..." The old man became more and more animated as he spoke.
    Large-Area High Yields
    We found the cooperative director, Comrade Bajdal, and the chief agronomist, Comrade Treisel, in the fields. They first introduced to the reporter the situation and experience of this year's bumper harvest.
    This year, the Dancic Cooperative had a total of 1,300 holts (approximately 8.55 mu each) of wheat, with an average yield of 1,900 kilograms per holt, of which 200 holts had an average yield of 2,100 kilograms. This is more than twice as high as the national and local average yield of wheat per holt.
    The cooperative's 100 holts of autumn barley had an average yield of 3,100 kilograms, more than twice as high as the national and local average yield per holt.
    At the National Agricultural Exhibition held in Budapest this September, the Dancic Cooperative won two special prizes for the large-area high yields of wheat and autumn barley.
    The 50 holts of pasture (alfalfa) sown by the cooperative yielded an average of 430 kilograms of seeds and 3,500 kilograms of feed per holt. It received a first prize at the National Agricultural Exhibition.
    The yields of other crops have also increased significantly this year. For example, the average yield of sugar beets per holt has increased by more than 12,000 kilograms compared to last year.
    However, the cooperative members are not complacent with the achievements they have made. They plan to further increase the yield per unit area of crops in the next few years, with wheat reaching 2,500 kilograms per holt and corn reaching 5,000 kilograms.
    When talking about the experience of large-area high yields in the Dancic Cooperative, the director and agronomist comrades emphasized the following points:
    1. Scientifically analyze and improve the soil. In recent years, all the cooperative's cultivated land has undergone careful analysis and research, divided into different planting areas, and often deep plowing or soil addition and various fertilizers are applied to improve the soil quality to make it most suitable for crop growth.
    2. Deep plowing. The average depth of the cooperative's cultivated land is 45 to 50 centimeters, while the general depth of cultivated land in other cooperatives is about 20 centimeters.
    3. Dense planting. An average of more than 140 kilograms of carefully selected fine seeds are used per holt of wheat, which is more than 40 kilograms more than other cooperatives.
    4. Apply more fertilizer. The state applies an average of 100 kilograms of chemical fertilizer per holt, while the Dancic Cooperative applies 300 to 400 kilograms of chemical fertilizer. More farmyard manure and green manure are also used than in other cooperatives and individual farmers.
    5. Timely cultivation, diligent protection and cultivation of crop growth. The cooperative has also built some canals, which are used for irrigation during droughts.
    The state-owned agricultural machinery station is of great help to the Dancic Cooperative. The cooperative has signed a fixed contract with the machinery station, and now all major field operations such as cultivation, sowing, and harvesting are carried out by machines. Without the support of the machinery station, it would be very difficult for the cooperative's 427 members to carry out intensive farming on more than 5,500 holts of land.
    The cooperative is very satisfied with the work of the machinery station. Tractor and combine operators often work around the clock in shifts to save time during the busy farming season.
    Vigorously Develop Diversified Operations
    Barley and wheat piled up like mountains,
    Apples and grapes fill the orchards,
    Chickens and ducks form a sea, pigs fill the pens,
    Herds of cattle and sheep stretch to the horizon.
    --This is a short poem written by an old member of the Dancic Cooperative not long ago to praise the great development of production in the cooperative.
    Indeed, the Dancic Cooperative has not only created records of large-area high yields in terms of crops, but they have also achieved gratifying results in animal husbandry.
    The cooperative now raises more than 3,000 pigs, including nearly 300 sows. The breeds of pigs are very good, fat, and large. By mid-October this year, 2,100 fat pigs have been sold to the state. Last year, 1,000 were sold, and it is expected that at least 3,000 fat pigs will be sold next year.
    There are also more than 1,500 sheep and 1,000 dairy cows. The cowsheds are very modern, equipped with electric lights, running water, feed conveyors, and milking machines. The cowsheds are very tidy and clean.
    Anka, the girl who was milking cows, told us that she came to work in the cooperative a year ago after graduating from middle school. She loves her job very much. In her spare time, she often reads books on animal husbandry and tries to continuously improve her work. She is also a very hardworking and capable girl. From January to the end of October this year, she has already had 500 workdays.
    In the past two years, the cooperative has also attached great importance to raising chickens and ducks. Last year, the cooperative had only 900 hens, but this year it has developed to 5,000. Each hen lays an average of 140 eggs per year.
    Now, 30,000 fat chickens are also raised, and it is expected that 60,000 fat chickens will be sold to the state next year. The cooperative also uses rivers and ponds to raise a large number of ducks.
    In the future, this cooperative will also vigorously develop animal husbandry. For this purpose, a livestock shed that can accommodate 150 cattle is being built, and the planting area of corn is expanded to produce more feed.
    In addition to the cooperative's public livestock and poultry, the members also raise dairy cows, fat pigs, and chickens and ducks in their own homes. We saw that the Boloks, a cooperative member's family, raised a dairy cow, two fat pigs, and seventy-eight chickens and geese.
    We also visited the orchard that the members have collectively cultivated over the past three years. The apple orchard alone covers more than 330 mu, and there is also a large vineyard. In a few years, this place will become a land of flowers and fruits, with apples weighing down the branches and grapes hanging full on the vines.
    From Backward to Advanced
    The Dancic Agricultural Production Cooperative was established in 1949. In the past ten years, it has gone through a difficult and complex path: from small to large, from wavering to consolidation, from a backward cooperative to one of the excellent cooperatives in Solnok State and the whole country.
    When the cooperative was first established, it had only 50 members, and very little cultivated land and livestock. However, the members overcame various difficulties, adhered to collective management, and continuously improved production. By 1953, the number of members had increased to 300, and the land in the cooperative had reached 4,000 holts.
    However, after June 1953, the revisionists headed by Nagy resisted socialist transformation, used their powers to support individual farmers instead of cooperatives, encouraged farmers to withdraw from cooperatives, and tolerated sabotage activities by rich peasants. This caused many difficulties for the consolidation and development of the Dancic Cooperative. Many members were ideologically confused and lacked confidence.
    During the counter-revolutionary rebellion in 1956, the counter-revolutionary elements carried out open sabotage activities, and some wavering farmers withdrew from the cooperative, but most of the members resolutely defended the cooperative and protected public property. The counter-revolutionary rebellion also made the working farmers realize that if capitalism were restored, it would mean that they would once again become the slaves of landlords and rich peasants.
    The Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government provided strong support to the agricultural production cooperatives in all aspects after the incident. Now, Comrade Bajdal, the director of the Dancic Cooperative, and Comrade Treisel, the agronomist, were sent to the cooperative in the spring of 1957 to strengthen the leadership of the cooperative. Before coming to the cooperative, Bajdal served as the local district Party committee secretary, and Treisel was the chief of the agricultural section of the Solnok State People's Council.
    In the Dancic Cooperative, the reporter visited many families and talked with men, women, old and young in the cooperative. Everyone praised the leadership of the cooperative in unison. After the two of them came to the cooperative, they devoted all their energy to the consolidation and development of the cooperative. Every morning, they went to the fields to work with the members and directed production in detail. Late at night, they still studied various production problems with other responsible persons and production team leaders in the cooperative and carefully formulated production plans. Under their firm leadership, the labor enthusiasm of the members has increased day by day, production results have changed rapidly, and labor discipline has improved unprecedentedly.
    In the past three years, the Party organization in the cooperative has also played a huge role in strengthening the ideological education of the farmers, carrying out struggles against all reactionary and backward tendencies, and enabling the farmers to recognize the bright prospects of socialist collective management. The exemplary role of the cooperative's 31 Party members in production has also greatly encouraged the broad masses.
    Although there was a drought last year, which affected the harvest of crops, the average yield per holt of crops in this cooperative still exceeded the records of the previous years, and far exceeded the average yield of individual farmers. Last year, animal husbandry also made a leap forward, fully demonstrating the superiority of socialist large-scale collective management.
    Therefore, this spring, the farmers in the whole village who had not yet joined the cooperative all asked to join the cooperative and embarked on the road of collectivization.
    In the spring, it was originally planned that each workday for cooperative members would be worth 37 forints. Because production has been done well, it now seems that each workday will be worth at least 42 forints. In order to invest more, rapidly improve production, and vigorously carry out public construction, the proportion of the total income of the Dancic Cooperative used for the public accumulation fund is more than twice as high as that of other cooperatives.
    With the development of production, the face of this cooperative rural area is undergoing tremendous changes. A large cultural palace will be completed in a few days. The hall has seats for more than 600 people. The cultural palace has a stage, a film projection room, a television, a library, and recreation rooms.
    Around the cultural palace, a modern rural area is being built. Each household is equipped with electric lights, running water, and a bathroom. Five residences have already been completed, and some cooperative members' families will soon move into their new homes. In the next few years, a decent sports field will be built, complete with a swimming pool...
    When reviewing the past and looking forward to the future, Comrade Bajdal, the director of the cooperative, said very firmly and optimistically: "There are no roses without thorns. We have encountered some difficulties in the past, and some problems will continue to arise in the future, but for the sake of the beautiful flowers of new life, we are not afraid of getting our hands scratched a little by a few thorns!"

    蒂萨河畔红旗飘
    本报记者　王崇杰
    当我们赶到蒂萨河东岸丹契奇农业生产合作社的办公室时，只有七十多岁的老人尤惹夫聚精会神地在打字，计算着社里的各种账目。
    “社长、总农艺师、党支部书记和所有能劳动的人都到田里忙秋收秋播去了。大家要我留在这里听电话，不然我也真想到地里干些活去。”尤惹夫老人微笑着向我们解释道。
    “今年8月索尔诺克州党委和议会授予我们社一面优秀社的红旗，9月份在全国农业展览会上我们又得了特等奖，大家要争取明年让庄稼长得更好……”老人愈讲愈带劲。
    大面积的高产
    在田野里我们找到了社长拜达尔和总农艺师特列赛尔同志。他们首先向记者介绍了今年丰收的情况和经验。
    丹契奇合作社今年共有一千三百霍尔特（约合八点五五市亩）小麦，每霍尔特的平均产量达到一千九百公斤，其中二百霍尔特的平均产量是二千一百公斤。这比全国和当地小麦每霍尔特的平均产量高一倍多。
    社里的一百霍尔特秋大麦的平均产量达到三千一百公斤，比全国和当地每霍尔特的平均产量高两倍多。
    今年9月在布达佩斯举行的全国农业展览会上，丹契奇合作社由于小麦和秋大麦大面积的高产，荣获两个特等奖。
    社里播种的五十霍尔特牧草（苜蓿草），每霍尔特平均产四百三十公斤种子，三千五百公斤饲料。在全国农业展览会上得到了头等奖。
    其他的农作物的产量今年也都有了显著的增长，如糖萝卜每霍尔特的平均产量就比去年提高了一万二千多公斤。
    但是社员们并不为已取得的成绩而自满，他们计划在今后几年内要进一步提高农作物的单位面积产量，其中小麦每霍尔特要达到二千五百公斤，玉米达到五千公斤。
    谈到丹契奇合作社大面积高产的经验时，社长和农艺师同志着重归纳出以下几点：
    一、科学地分析和改良土壤。几年来社里的全部耕地都经过了仔细的分析和研究，划分了不同的播种区，并经常根据需要进行深翻或加土，施加各种化肥来改良土质，使其最适于农作物的成长。
    二、深耕。这个社耕地的深度平均是四十五厘米到五十厘米，而其他社耕地的一般深度是二十厘米左右。
    三、密植。麦子每霍尔特平均用一百四十多公斤精选的良种，比其他社多用四十多公斤。
    四、多施肥。本州每霍尔特平均施化肥一百公斤，而丹契奇合作社施三百公斤到四百公斤化肥。圈肥和绿肥也比其他社和个体农民用得多。
    五、及时耕种，辛勤地保护和培植作物的成长。社里并修了一些水渠，天旱时便进行灌溉。
    国营农业机器站对丹契奇合作社的帮助是很大的。合作社同机器站订了固定的合同，现在全部的耕地、播种和收割等主要田间劳动都是用机器进行的。没有机器站的支持，这个合作社的四百二十七个社员要在五千五百多霍尔特的土地上进行深耕细作是非常困难的。
    社里对机器站的工作很满意。拖拉机和康拜因手在农忙时为了抢时间，经常日夜不停地轮流工作。
    大搞多种经营
    大麦小麦堆成山，
    苹果葡萄遍果园，
    鸡鸭成海猪满圈，
    牛群羊群连天边。
    ——这是丹契奇合作社一位老社员不久前写的歌赞社里生产大发展的短诗。
    的确，丹契奇合作社不仅在农作物方面创造了大面积高产的纪录，他们在畜牧业方面也取得了令人喜悦的成绩。
    现在社里养了三千多头猪，其中近三百头母猪。猪种都是非常优良的，又肥又大。今年到10月中旬已卖给国家二千一百头肥猪了。去年卖了一千头，明年预计至少要卖三千头肥猪。
    还有一千五百多头羊和一千头奶牛。牛舍都是很现代化的，设有电灯、自来水、饲料传送带和挤奶器等。牛舍里非常整齐清洁。
    正在挤牛奶的姑娘安卡告诉我们说，她是一年前在中学毕业后来社工作的。她非常热爱自己的工作。工作之余她经常阅读有关畜牧业方面的书籍，设法不断改进自己的工作。她也是一个很勤劳能干的姑娘，从今年1月到10月底，她已有五百个劳动日。
    最近两年来这个合作社也很重视养鸡养鸭。去年社里还只有九百只母鸡，今年已发展到五千只。每只母鸡每年平均生蛋一百四十个。
    现在还养着三万只肥鸡，预计明年卖六万只肥鸡给国家。社里并利用河流和池塘养了一大批鸭子。
    今后这个社还要大力发展畜牧业。为此正在兴建一所能容纳一百五十头牛的畜舍，并扩大了玉米的播种面积，增产更多的饲料。
    除了社里公共的牲畜和家禽外，社员在自己家中也养有奶牛、肥猪和鸡鸭。我们在社员博洛克的家中就看到他们养了一头奶牛、两只肥猪和七十八只鸡和鹅。
    我们还参观了三年来社员们集体栽培起来的果园。仅苹果林就达三百三十多亩，还有一大片葡萄园。几年后这里将成为花果之乡，苹果压枝头，葡萄挂满架。
    从落后到先进
    丹契奇农业生产合作社成立于1949年。十年来它走过一段艰苦复杂的道路：从小到大，从动摇到巩固，从一个落后社变成了索尔诺克州和全国优秀的合作社之一。
    这个社最初成立时，只有五十个社员，耕地和牲畜都很少。但是社员们克服了种种困难，坚持了集体经营，并且不断地提高了生产。到1953年，社员增加到三百人，入社土地已达四千霍尔特。
    但是在1953年6月以后，以纳吉为首的修正主义分子抵制社会主义改造，利用职权支持个体农民，而不支持合作社，鼓励农民退社，容忍富农进行破坏活动。这对丹契奇合作社的巩固和发展造成了很多困难。不少的社员思想混乱，信心不足。
    1956年反革命叛乱时，反革命分子开展了公开的破坏活动，部分动摇的农民退出了社，但大部分社员坚决保卫了社，保卫了公共财产。通过反革命叛乱，也使劳动农民认识到，假若让资本主义复辟，那就是意味着他们将重新成为地主和富农的奴仆。
    社会主义工人党和工农革命政府在事变后从各方面给予农业生产合作社以大力的支持。现在丹契奇合作社的社长拜达尔和农艺师特列赛尔就是在1957年春天为了加强社的领导派到社里来工作的。拜达尔在来社前是担任当地的区党委书记，特列赛尔是索尔诺克州议会农业科的科长。
    在丹契奇合作社记者访问了很多家庭，同社里的男女老少进行了交谈。大家都异口同声称赞社的领导。他们两人来社后，把自己全部的精力都用于社的巩固和发展上。每天清晨起，他们便同社员们一起下田劳动，具体地指挥生产。深夜时他们还是同社的其他负责人和生产队长一起研究各种生产问题，认真地制定生产计划。在他们坚定的领导下，社员们的劳动情绪日益高涨，生产成绩日新月异，劳动纪律也空前地好转了。
    三年来，社的党组织在加强对农民的思想教育方面也发挥了巨大的作用，同一切反动和落后的倾向开展了斗争，使农民认清了社会主义集体经营的美好前景。社里三十一个党员在生产中的模范作用，也大大鼓舞了广大群众。
    去年虽然天旱，影响了农作物的收成，但这个社的农作物每霍尔特的平均产量仍超过了前几年的纪录，更远远地超过了个体农民的平均产量。去年畜牧业也有了飞跃的发展。充分显示了社会主义大规模集体经营的优越性。
    所以，今年春天全村还未入社的农民都纷纷要求入了社，走上了合作化的道路。
    春季原定社员每个劳动日可得三十七福林，由于生产搞得好，现在看来每个劳动日至少可得四十二福林。为了更多地进行投资，快速提高生产和大力进行公共建设，丹契奇合作社每年的总收入用于公积金的比例比其他社高一倍多。
    随着生产的发展，这个合作化农村的面貌正在发生着巨大的变化。一所大型的文化宫日内就要建成，大厅设有六百多人的座位，文化宫内有舞台、电影放映室、电视机、图书馆、娱乐室等。
    在文化宫的周围正在建筑一个现代化的农村，每家都设有电灯、自来水和浴室。现在已有五所住宅落成，不久一些社员的家庭就要迁入新居。最近几年还要建设一个像样的运动场，并附有游泳池……
    在回顾过去和展望未来时，社长拜达尔同志非常坚定和乐观地说道：“没有不带刺的玫瑰。过去我们遇到一些困难，今后还会不断出现一些问题，但为了新生活艳丽的花朵，我们决不怕手被几根刺划破了一点！”
