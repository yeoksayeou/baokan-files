Captain Mo Jiarui, a famous captain on the Sichuan River, has served as captain and chief pilot on ships such as Huatong, Huakang, Huayuan, People's No. 1, and Jiangxia for nine years, safely navigating 550,000 kilometers without any accidents. He has been named an advanced model worker in Chongqing Port, Chongqing City, and the Yangtze River area, and this year he was also named an advanced producer in Wuhan City. This old captain, who has always strived for the top in his work over the years, is well known by sailors on the Sichuan River, and he has become a model for sailors on the Yangtze River route.

Last March, it was the worst dry season in the Sichuan River in twenty years. Chairman Mao was to travel from Chongqing to Wuhan on the Jiangxia ship. The original captain and political commissar of the Jiangxia ship felt a great responsibility and repeatedly requested the leadership to transfer Captain Mo Jiarui to navigate the ship.

When Comrade Mo Jiarui accepted this task, he said happily and solemnly: "I will definitely deliver Chairman Mao to Wuhan safely and steadily."

On the day of departure, it was just dawn when Mo Jiarui ran to check the water conditions. When he saw that the water condition symbol was a "+" (indicating rising water), he was not reassured and blinked his eyes to look again before returning to the ship. He said happily to the crew: "Chairman Mao has brought us water! Chairman Mao has brought us water!"

During the few days of sailing from Chongqing to Wuhan, he personally piloted and supervised the pilotage on many dangerous waterways, successfully completing the important task entrusted by the Party and 600 million people, and delivering Chairman Mao safely to Wuhan.

The Sichuan River is a well-known river with many shoals, dangerous waters, and hidden reefs. In the past, ships generally sailed from Yichang to Chongqing during the day, taking four days upstream and two days downstream.

When the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was in full swing and urgently needed roadbed materials, the transportation task was very urgent. "How can we transport more?" Mo Jiarui thought at that time, "If we navigate carefully at night with moonlight, we can still sail at night." After he put forward this suggestion, he immediately received the support and encouragement of the leadership. Thanks to his careful pilotage, he broke the historical record of the Sichuan River of not being able to sail at night, shortening the round trip between Chongqing and Yichang from six days to five days. Later, he created downstream night navigation on the Sichuan River, further reducing the round trip time by one day.

Mo Jiarui's creative work is admired by many people. Once, when the ship sailed to the Stinking Salt Shoal area, the waterway was blocked by silt and sand deposits. His ship and other ships such as Huatang, Jingmen, Zhujiang, and Yangtze 2002 could not move forward. So he personally led the second and third pilots to take a wooden boat to the Stinking Salt Shoal area and conducted several hours of exploration, finding a small channel on the left that could be used by ships. The discovery of this new waterway enabled the other four ships, which had been delayed for a day, to sail as well.

This happened when Comrade Mo Jiarui was the captain and chief pilot of the Huayuan ship. Huayuan, Minlian, Mingui and other ships were large ships on the Sichuan River in the past. During the dry season of the Sichuan River (Yichang water level 1.52 meters), these ships had to stop service and change to sailing in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Once the large ships stopped service, the transportation of materials between Chongqing and Yichang would immediately become tense. Mo Jiarui felt worried when he thought of so many materials waiting to be transported. Thinking, thinking, he thought of the story of the Red Army's Long March and was greatly inspired. He thought: "Roads are made by people. The North Channel of Kongling cannot be used, and no one has ever used the South Channel. We should try it." In order to transport more materials for the country, he postponed the end of service and changed to using the South Channel during the dry season, and successfully sailed when the Yichang water level was 1.52 meters. Under his leadership, similar ships continued to sail during the dry season. Later, he was transferred to be the captain and chief pilot of the People's No. 1 ship. Similar ships included Dazhong and Minzhong. According to convention, the ships would stop service when the Chongqing water level reached 3.3 meters, but Mo Jiarui also explored new waterways when the Chongqing water level was 2.5 meters and the Yichang water level was 1.39 meters, and sailed during the dry season.

During navigation, Mo Jiarui not only ensured the safe navigation of the giant People's No. 1 ship on the Sichuan River, but also tapped the potential to increase the ship's deadweight tonnage from 1,000 tons to 1,250 tons, and tow barges of 500 to 700 tons. Although there were many difficulties, thanks to his reliance on the masses to find solutions and his careful study, he finally succeeded in sailing. Later, under his influence, the Dazhong ship also towed barges.

Mo Jiarui can humbly learn from others and is also willing to pass on his experience to others. Sailors spread the saying: "You don't have to worry about not learning technology when you work with Captain Mo." He is not only a captain loved by sailors, but also has a very good relationship with wooden boat workers on the Sichuan River.

Mo Jiarui also has an outstanding characteristic in his pilotage and driving work, which is to ensure collective safety. During navigation, when his own ship is landing on the beach, entering the channel, and meeting other ships, he always considers whether it will affect the safety of other ships. In ship meetings, he particularly emphasizes the treatment of wooden boats. On curved waterways, he always reduces speed first to avoid accidents in which waves sink wooden boats. If there is a ship following behind, he will also tell the wooden boat to prepare in advance. When stopping at a port, he always leaves the good anchorage to the ships behind. He often said to the drivers: "We can't rely on 'overlord ships'. We must leave good places for others to ensure everyone's safety." His actions to protect collective safety are loved and respected by sailors and wooden boat workers on the Sichuan River.

Mo Jiarui did not become arrogant and complacent with his decades of experience and superb skills in navigating the Sichuan River, but instead humbly and continuously learned from others. It is precisely because of this that he has been continuously improved. For example, when the People's No. 1 ship towed iron barges downstream for the first time, he specifically studied some technical problems in towing operations with the chief pilot and other comrades in advance. When anchoring at "Xinjun Estuary" for the first time, in addition to humbly consulting the second pilot who was more familiar with the anchorage, he also humbly consulted the local fishermen to understand the anchoring situation in more detail. Because he was not familiar with the waterway in the middle reaches of the Sichuan River, he consulted the second mate who had served as a pilot in the middle reaches, and asked him about the changes in the shallow shoal channels, why they changed like this, and how the various wharves in the middle reaches should be berthed. He humbly became a student of others, and also enthusiastically became a teacher for others. He said: "Teaching technology to others is contributing a force to the country." In the daily safety meeting, he always pointed out some problems in navigation technology in detail, and told the drivers how to pilot the ship and steer according to the actual conditions of each section of the waterway. When the second and third pilots were on duty, he sacrificed his rest time to help them pilot, in order to improve their skills. Thanks to his enthusiastic teaching, he has trained more than ten drivers and pilots, strengthening the country's technical team.

    战胜川江激流
    ——记江峡轮船长莫家瑞的事迹
    川江上著名的船长莫家瑞，九年来先后在华同、华康、华源、人民一号、江峡等轮船担任船长、大引水等职务，安全航行了五十五万公里，从没有发生过任何事故。他曾经被评为重庆港、重庆市和长江区的甲等模范，今年又被评为武汉市先进生产者。这位多少年来在工作上始终是力争上游的老船长，川江上的海员们是很少不知道他的，他已经成为长江航线上海员们学习的榜样。
    去年3月，正逢川江二十年来未有的枯水季节。毛主席要由重庆乘江峡轮到武汉。江峡轮原船长和政委感到责任重大，一再向领导提出要求调莫家瑞船长来领航。
    莫家瑞同志在接受这个任务时，愉快而又庄严地说：“我一定安安稳稳地把主席送到武汉。”
    起航那天，天刚亮，莫家瑞就跑去看水情，当他看到水情符号是“十”字（表示涨水），他不放心，眨了眨眼睛又看了一遍，才回到船上，他高兴地对船员说：“毛主席给我们带来了水！毛主席给我们带来了水！”
    在从重庆到武汉的这几天航程中，在许多危险航道上，他都亲自领航和监督引水领航，胜利地完成了党和六亿人民的重大委托，把毛主席平安地送到了武汉。
    川江是有名的滩多、水险、瞧石暗布的河道，过去一般船舶从宜昌到重庆都是白天航行，上水走四天、下水走两天。
    在成渝铁路施工紧张急需路基材料的时候，运输任务十分紧迫。“怎样才能多运呢？”那时莫家瑞想道，“如果晚上有月色小心航行，夜间还是可以行船的。”他把这个建议提出以后，立刻得到领导的支持和鼓励。由于他谨慎领航，打破了川江有史以来不能夜航的局面，把重庆—宜昌间的往返航期由六天缩短到五天。以后他又创造了川江下水夜航，把往返航期又减少了一天。
    莫家瑞的创造性劳动，是很多人都敬佩的。有一次船航行到臭盐碛地段，这里因为流沙沉淀淤塞了航道，他的船和华唐、荆门、珠江、长江二○○二等轮都不能前行。于是他亲自带领了二引水、三引水坐木划子到臭盐碛地段进行了几小时的探测，摸出左边有一个小漕口可以驶过轮船，这个新航道的发现，使延误一天航期的其他四只轮船也都开航了。
    这是莫家瑞同志在华源轮当船长兼大引水时的事。华源、民联、民贵等轮是过去川江上的大型轮船，川江枯水期间（宜昌水位一点五二米），这些船都要收班改在长江中、下游开航。大型轮船一停班，重庆—宜昌间的物资运输马上就会紧张起来。莫家瑞想起这样多的待运物资心里就发愁。想着，想着，他想起红军长征的故事，受到很大的启发。他想：“路是人走出来的，崆岭北漕不能走，南漕没有人走过，应该去试试。”他为了给国家多运物资，推迟收班时间在枯水期间改走南漕，结果在宜昌水位一点五二米时航行成功了。在他带动之下，同型船舶也在枯水位时期继续航行。以后他调任人民一号的船长兼大引水，同型船舶还有大众、民众。按照惯例，重庆水位三点三米就要收班，但莫家瑞在重庆水位二点五米、宜昌水位一点三九米时，也摸索新航道，在枯水季节开航。
    在航行中，莫家瑞不但保证人民一号这一巨型轮船在川江安全航行，而且还挖掘潜力使轮船载重定额由一千吨提到一千二百五十吨，并加拖五百至七百吨的驳船。虽然困难很多，但由于他依靠群众想办法，细心钻研，终于航行成功。以后大众轮在他的影响下，也拖驳行驶了。
    莫家瑞能虚心向别人学习，也乐意把自己的经验传授给别人。海员们流传这样一句话：“跟莫船长一起工作不愁学不会技术。”他不仅是海员爱戴的船长，川江上的木船工人和他的关系也都很好。
    莫家瑞在领航和驾驶工作中还有一个突出的特点，这就是：确保集体安全。在航行中，他自己的船上滩、进漕和会船的时候，他都要考虑到是否影响其他船只的安全。在会船中更突出的是对待木船。在弯曲的航道上，他都先减低车速，以免发生浪沉木船的事故。如果后面有轮船跟着，他还要告诉木船，预先作好准备。在停港时，他总是把好锚地留给后面的船队。他常对驾驶人员说：“不能靠‘霸王船’，要给别人留好地方，保证大家的安全。”他这种爱护集体安全的行动，受到川江海员和沿岸木船工人们的爱戴和尊敬。
    莫家瑞并没有以他数十年航行川江的经验和精湛的技术自傲自满，而是虚心地不断地向别人学习，正因为如此，他才得到不断地提高。例如人民一号轮第一次绑拖铁驳下驶，他事先和大引水等同志具体研究了拖驳作业上的一些技术问题。第一次锚泊“新军口”的时候，他除了虚心请教对这个锚地比较熟悉的二引水以外，为了更详细地了解锚地形势，就虚心请教当地渔船的渔民。因为他对川江中游航道不太熟悉，就请教曾担任中游引水的二副，向他请教浅滩漕口的变化情况，为什么要这样变化，以及中游各码头应该如何靠泊等技术问题。他虚心地向别人当学生，也热情地为别人当先生，他说：“把技术教给别人就是为国家贡献一份力量。”他在每天的安全会议上，总是详细地指出航行技术上的一些问题，并按照每一段航道实际情况告诉驾驶员应如何引船执舵，二引水，三引水值班时，他自己牺牲休息时间帮助他们引航，以提高技术。由于他的热心教导，先后培养了十多名驾引人员，为国家壮大了技术队伍。
