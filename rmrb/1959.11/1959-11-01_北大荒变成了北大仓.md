Heilongjiang Province has been transformed from the historically backward "Great Northern Wilderness" into the Great Northern Granary, an important grain base for our country.

Heilongjiang Province, stretching from the Wusuli River in the east to the Nenjiang Plain in the west, from the Heilongjiang River in the north to the shores of Jingbo Lake in the south, has become a prosperous, happy, and beautiful place. Like a beautiful swan, bathing in the morning sun of the motherland, it is spreading its powerful wings to fly high in the sky. One of its wings is the important industrial base, centered on heavy industry and built by the state, with modern large-scale enterprises as its backbone; the other wing is the vast countryside that has begun to embark on the road of agricultural mechanization, making it an important agricultural region of our country. The development of agricultural production in Heilongjiang not only ensures that the important industrial base beside it has enough grain and a large amount of raw materials, but also continuously supports the whole country with a large amount of grain, soybeans, and even vegetables, becoming an important commodity base for our country.

	A Fertile Land Asleep for Thousands of Years

Here, everywhere is black, fertile land, with the black soil layer reaching four or five feet deep in many places. Many farmers who moved from other places, picked up a handful of black soil like millet grains, looked at it again and again,捏了又捏, and said enviously: "This soil is so fertile it's flowing with oil!" A few years ago, a foreign soil expert came here, saw such fertile soil, and praised: This soil can be used as fertilizer. Speaking of the water source here, there are more than a thousand large and small rivers, forming a dense water network. Developing agricultural production here also has more favorable conditions; the sunshine hours in summer are particularly long, shining from three o'clock in the morning to seven or eight o'clock in the evening. People concentrate these advantages and call them "fertile soil, sufficient water, and long sunshine."

However, such a rich treasure has been asleep for thousands of years, and in the old society it did not bring happiness and prosperity to the broad masses of working people, but only boundless pain and disaster. This rich place has been called "Great Northern Wilderness" for generations. Only after liberation, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, and through the hard work of the people of the whole province, can the Great Northern Wilderness be transformed into the Great Northern Granary in just over ten years.

	People Have Come to Awaken It

The most fundamental reason why Heilongjiang has changed from the Great Northern Wilderness to the Great Northern Granary is that, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, the old relations of production have been changed, enabling the productive forces to develop by leaps and bounds. Over the past ten years, the millions of farmers here have become farmers with socialist consciousness under the education of the Party, and they have a strong desire to change the state of "poverty and blankness" and build socialism. In the ten years since liberation, the farmers have gone through various historical development stages step by step, including temporary mutual aid teams, permanent mutual aid teams, elementary agricultural production cooperatives, and advanced agricultural production cooperatives. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the people's communes were realized. Following each stage of development in the relations of production, the productive forces in the countryside here have been continuously liberated. Especially since the Great Leap Forward and the communization of the people last year, the productive forces have leaped forward at a greater speed. In addition, this area has a relatively strong industrial base, which enables the area to begin to embark on the road of agricultural mechanization relatively early. Now, one-third of the people's communes in the province have tractors to varying degrees. The state has also helped train more than 20,000 tractor drivers and 2,000 agricultural technicians. This has prepared the conditions for the great development of agriculture in Heilongjiang Province.

	Let It Become a Granary

If in the past Heilongjiang Province only had the natural conditions of "fertile soil, sufficient water, and long sunshine," then now this area has the added favorable conditions of "strong people, strong horses, and many machines." In the various agricultural seasons here, a large part of the heavy physical labor is replaced by horses and agricultural machinery. The number of draft horses in Heilongjiang Province ranks first in the country, and there are more than 200,000 new-style animal-drawn farm implements. It also owns tens of thousands of tractors and thousands of combine harvesters, forming a strong agricultural mechanization position. This year, 50% of the cultivated land in the province is cultivated with mechanized farm implements and new-style animal-drawn farm implements.

The formation of this important agricultural area also lies in the fact that the state has established many state-owned mechanized farms here. As early as the early days of liberation, in order to guide the backward individual economy to gradually transform into modern large-scale agricultural production, starting in the winter of 1947, when the War of Liberation was in full swing, preparations began for the establishment of the state-owned Tongbei Farm here. The following year, the farm began to put into production, thus unveiling the prelude to agricultural mechanization in Heilongjiang Province. Then, one modern large farm after another was established. Especially since 1954, the establishment of the state-owned Youyi Farm with a complete set of equipment donated by the Soviet government and the organization by the state of demobilized officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to build the Mishan Reclamation Area and the Hegang Reclamation Area has entered a new stage in the development of state-owned mechanized farms. Now, there are 75 mechanized farms of various types in the province, and they have become the state's commodity bases for producing soybeans, pork, and eggs. The construction of these large farms has greatly changed the face of Heilongjiang. Like a pearl inlaid on the northeastern corner of the motherland, it illuminates the people's path forward. In the past, in that vast wilderness, it was a place where roe deer and wild deer gathered. Now, it has become a large farm with soybean fields connected to soybean fields and wheat seas connected to wheat seas. Many farms have established livestock farms and various processing plants to serve agricultural production. Like the state-owned Youyi Farm, it is simply a new agricultural city.

Along with the construction of these large agricultural enterprises, there are also hundreds of new immigrant villages established here with the help of the state. These are places where farmers who were moved from many provinces in Guannei by the state after 1949 live. These immigrants, unlike their ancestors, were forced to "go to Northeast China" because they were forced by life; instead, they came with the purpose of building the Great Northern Granary and turning the Great Northern Wilderness into a rich Great Northern Granary. With the help of more than 20 tractor reclamation stations established by the state, they have reclaimed millions of acres of wasteland and established four or five hundred new-type immigrant villages. In recent years, they have not only increased the production of a large amount of grain for the country, but also brought many changes to the border areas of the motherland.

	Let It Become Richer and Richer

In the countryside that has begun to embark on the road of agricultural mechanization, in the countryside that has already realized the communization of the people, can it still be said that it is the Great Northern Wilderness? You see, around Harbin, which is famous for its electromechanical industry, is the famous Songhua River Granary, which is rich in soybeans and sorghum; around Qiqihar, an important industrial city, is the Nenjiang Plain, which produces a large amount of grain; in Jiamusi and Mudanjiang cities, and in the emerging cities of Hegang, Jixi, and Shuangyashan, etc., they are surrounded by granaries—the Great Northern Wilderness has become the Great Northern Granary.

Over the past ten years, the cultivated land in this area alone has increased by more than 27 million mu, and the total grain output has increased several times compared with just after liberation. The average labor force in the province produces 45 jin of grain per day. The people's communes that use new-style animal-drawn farm implements produce 60 jin of grain per day per labor force. Mechanized farms produce even more grain, with one labor force producing 100 jin per day. There is also a strange thing at the state-owned Youyi Farm: the second production team of the fifth branch of this farm, forty people, due to the result of highly agricultural mechanization, planted a total of 19,200 mu of land, and each person produced 140,000 jin of grain per year.

The Great Northern Granary has even greater prospects, and with the development of the national economy, it will increasingly show its greater role. There are still hundreds of millions of acres of grassland waiting for people to develop. Heilongjiang is beckoning to people, welcoming everyone to develop and build.

    北大荒变成了北大仓
    黑龙江省已经由历史上遗留下来的落后的“北大荒”，变成了我国重要的粮食基地北大仓。
    黑龙江省东起乌苏里江，西到嫩江平原，北起黑龙江畔，南到镜泊湖滨，已经变为一个繁荣幸福美丽的地方。她像一只美丽的天鹅，沐浴在祖国的早晨的阳光里，正在用两只有力的翅膀，在高空展翅飞翔。她的一只翅膀是已经建成的、国家的以重工业为中心，以现代化大型企业为骨干的重要工业基地；而另一只翅膀，是已经开始走上农业机械化道路的广大农村，她已经成为我国的重要农业地区。黑龙江农业生产的发展，不仅保证了在她身旁的重要工业基地有足够的粮食和大批原料，而且正用大量的粮食、大豆以至蔬菜源源支援全国，成为我国一个重要的商品基地。
    沉睡了千年的沃土
    在这里，到处都是黑油油的肥沃的土地，好多地方黑土层达四、五尺深。许多从外地移来的农民，抓起一把像小米粒的黑油土，放在手里看了又看，捏了又捏，羡慕地说：“这土肥得流油啊！”几年前有一位外国的土壤专家来到这里，看到了这样肥沃的土壤，也称赞地说：这土可以作肥料。讲起这里的水源，有一千多条大大小小的河流，形成一个稠密的水网。这里发展农业生产，还有更有利的条件，夏季的日照时间特别长，从早上三点钟照到晚上七、八点。人们把这些优点集中起来，叫做“土肥水足，日照长”。
    可是，这样富饶的宝藏，已经沉睡了几千年，在旧社会没有给广大劳动人民带来幸福和繁荣，只是无边的痛苦和灾难。这块富饶的地方，世世代代被人们叫作“北大荒”。只有在解放后，在共产党的英明领导下，经过全省人民辛勤的劳动，才能在短短的十多年的时间里，把北大荒变成了北大仓。
    来了唤醒它的人
    黑龙江由北大荒变成北大仓，最根本的原因是，在共产党的英明领导下，改变了旧的生产关系，使生产力向前飞跃发展。这里的千百万农民，十多年来在党的教育下，已经成为有社会主义觉悟的农民，他们有着要求改变“一穷二白”状态、建设社会主义的强烈愿望。在解放后十多年来，农民一步一步经过临时互助组、常年互助组、初级农业生产合作社、高级农业生产合作社等各个历史发展阶段，经过1958年大跃进，实现了人民公社化。紧随着生产关系的每一个发展阶段，这里农村的生产力不断地得到解放，特别是在去年大跃进和人民公社化以来，生产力以更大的速度向前飞跃。加上这里有着比较强大的工业基础，使这个地区有条件比较早地开始走上农业机械化道路。现在全省三分之一的人民公社已经或多或少有了拖拉机。国家并帮助培养了二万多名拖拉机手和二千名农业技术干部。这就为黑龙江省农业大发展准备了条件。
    让它变成大仓
    如果说，在过去的黑龙江省，只有“土肥水足，日照长”的自然条件，那么，现在这个地区又加上了“人强马壮机器多”的有利条件了。这里的各个农事季节，有很大一部分繁重的体力劳动由马匹和农业机器来代替了。黑龙江省耕马的数量占全国的首位，新式畜力农具已达二十多万件，还拥有上万台的拖拉机和成千台的联合收割机；构成了一个强大的农业机械化阵地，今年全省50％的耕地，是用机械化农具和新式畜力农具耕作的。
    这个重要农业地区的形成，还在于国家在这里建立了许多国营机械化农场。早在解放初期，党为了引导落后的个体经济逐步地转变为现代化大农业生产，从1947年的冬季，解放战争正在紧张进行的时候，这里就开始筹办国营通北农场。第二年，这个农场开始投入生产，从此揭开了黑龙江省农业机械化的序幕。接着，一个个现代化大农场建立起来了。特别是1954年以来，建立了由苏联政府赠送全套设备的国营友谊农场和由国家组织了中国人民解放军复员官兵建设密山垦区和合江垦区，国营机械化农场的发展进入了一个新的阶段。现在全省已有各种类型的机械化农场七十五处，他们已成为国家生产大豆、猪肉、鸡蛋的商品基地。这些大农场的建设，大大改变了黑龙江的面貌，它像嵌在祖国东北角上的明珠，照耀着人民前进的道路。往日，在那一望无际的荒野里，是獐?野鹿聚居的地方，如今变成了豆田连着豆田，麦海接着麦海的大农场。许多农场已设立了畜牧场和为农业生产服务的各种加工厂。像国营友谊农场，简直是一座新的农业城市。
    和这些大农业企业建设的同时，这里还有数百个在国家帮助下建立起来的移民新村。那是从1949年以后，国家从关内许多省份移来的农民聚居的地方。这些移民，不像他们的祖辈，为了生活所逼被迫“下关东”；而是抱着建设北大仓，把北大荒变成富饶的北大仓的目的而来的。他们在国家设立的二十多个拖拉机垦荒站的帮助下，开垦了数以百万亩计的荒地，建立了四、五百个新型的移民村庄，几年来他们不仅给国家增产了大批的粮食，还给祖国的边疆带来了许多的变化。
    让它富上加富
    在开始走上农业机械化道路的农村，在已经实现人民公社化的农村，还能说它是北大荒么？你看，在以机电工业著称的哈尔滨周围，是有名的松花江谷仓，盛产着大豆和高粱；在重要工业城市齐齐哈尔的周围，有着出产大量粮食的嫩江平原；在佳木斯、牡丹江市，在新兴的鹤岗、鸡西、双鸭山等城市的周围，都被谷仓所包围——北大荒已经变成了北大仓。
    十多年来，这个地区仅耕地就增加了二千七百多万亩，粮食总产量比刚解放时成倍的增长，全省平均一个劳动力一天生产四十五斤粮食。使用新式畜力农具耕作的人民公社，一个劳动力一天生产六十斤粮食。机械化农场生产的粮食更多，一个劳动力一天生产一百斤。在国营友谊农场还有一件奇事：这个农场的五分场第二生产队，四十个人，由于高度农业机械化的结果，共播种了一万九千二百亩地，每人一年生产十四万斤粮食。
    北大仓还有更远大的前途，随着国民经济的发展，将日益显示出他更大的作用。这里还有上亿亩的草原正等待人们去开发。黑龙江向人们招手，欢迎大家来开发，来建设。
