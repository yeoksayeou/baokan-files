    The Truth of History and the Truth of Art

    The discussion sparked this year by the reevaluation of Cao Cao not only touches upon the issue of correctly assessing historical figures but also involves the evaluation of the classic novel "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," traditional Three Kingdoms operas, and the creative practice of contemporary historical dramas. This has garnered attention from both historical and literary circles. Recently, the Shanghai Yue Opera Troupe's new drama "Empress Wu Zetian" has also touched upon the issue of reevaluating Wu Zetian, drawing the attention of historians and artists. The "Drama News" published the speeches from a symposium in its twentieth issue. Here, we are publishing excerpts from Comrade Wu Han's speech.

    In the past, there were often contradictions between history and historical dramas. For instance, I recently studied operas about Hai Rui and saw that some of them depicted Zhang Juzheng as a traitor plotting rebellion with his entire family. The theme of these operas does not align with objectively existing historical facts. Such distortions are neither convincing nor can they change historical facts. However, it illustrates the point that some people were indeed dissatisfied with certain policies of Zhang Juzheng, leading to rumors, attacks, slander, and distortions, reflecting a political struggle of a particular period. Zhang Juzheng was, in fact, a famous powerful minister of the Ming Dynasty, who neither rebelled nor failed to do some good things. Historical dramas that reflect historical reality, some of which are based on historical facts, some on folk legends, and some that merely borrow famous historical figures, embellish and exaggerate them into dramas. For example, the operas about the Yang family generals are, strictly speaking, hard to classify as historical dramas. Because apart from Yang Ye, Yang Yanzhao, and Yang Wenguang, who were historical figures, many of the related stories are fictional. However, they are still good operas because they express the just demands of the broad masses of people to resist foreign aggression. Pan Renmei is a typical villain in the operas, the antagonist of the Yang family. The historical Pan Mei was not a villain, but Pan Renmei in the operas is portrayed as a hated villain. Pan Renmei is not equal to Pan Mei, and the Yang family generals are not entirely historical dramas. On this point, history and drama can and should be distinguished.

    However, if one wants to strictly write a historical drama, then one cannot be free from the constraints of history. If it is fundamentally contrary to historical facts, then it cannot be called a historical drama. At the same time, writers also have the freedom to create characters and stories. If a drama follows history in every detail, or writes in chronological order, without distinguishing between major and minor, without making certain prominent exaggerations or embellishments, and is exactly the same as historical facts, then it becomes history, not a drama, lacking romantic atmosphere and flavor. Historians have no right to say: historical dramas must be written entirely according to historical facts; but playwrights also have no right to say: writing historical dramas can be completely free from the constraints of objectively existing historical facts. I believe that the relationship between historical dramas and history should be both connected and distinct. Connected, in that the major events depicted in historical dramas should basically conform to historical facts; distinct, in that playwrights can make some choices and modifications to the subject matter, and make some additions, deletions, embellishments, and exaggerations to the plot, according to the needs of the drama. Those who write history cannot demand a hundred percent accuracy from art (doing so is impossible even for historians), but the basic historical facts reflected in art must be roughly the same as the objectively existing historical facts. For example, when writing about Wu Zetian, one must achieve a basic unity with history. The good people in history should be written as good people, and the bad people should be written as bad people, and one cannot reverse good and bad, right and wrong (of course, some figures who have been distorted by feudal historians should be reevaluated).

    When creating historical dramas, one should use a combination of realism and romanticism. Historical dramas require playwrights to reflect realistically, reflecting the truth of the era of the characters and the truth of events, and conducting patriotic historical education for the people; while artistic creation must be based on realism, with exaggeration and creation, using romantic methods, learning from "On Contradiction," distinguishing between major and minor, focusing on one point and taking care of the overall situation, achieving artistic perfection and achieving the best educational effect. In the past, there were indeed contradictions between the two, but today, contradictions can be unified and can be resolved. And through the research and discussion of artists, historical operas will increasingly play an increasingly significant educational role among the people.

    Regarding the historical status of Wu Zetian. Wu Zetian is a rich, complex, and great historical figure. Affirming this character is correct, and I fully agree. But the ending of "Empress Wu Zetian," portraying her as a failed character, saying that she lost, is not very appropriate. From a historical perspective, this conclusion cannot be drawn. Is the author looking at the issue from Wu Zetian's individual events, or from the main aspect of her progressive role in that era? I believe that Wu Zetian was a successful figure, not a tragic figure. In the history of the Tang Dynasty, Emperor Taizong of Tang laid the foundation, followed by the era of Wu Zetian, and then the Kaiyuan prosperous era. In the fifty years before and after Wu Zetian's reign, production developed, land was developed, the population increased, the territory expanded, culture improved, and there was extensive exchange with foreign countries. Moreover, the main politicians of the Kaiyuan era were all cultivated during the Wu Zetian era. It can be said that without the long-term consolidation and development work of the Wu Zetian era, the prosperous situation of Kaiyuan would not have been possible. Of course, it is not to say that all this was Wu Zetian's personal achievement, but it must be said that she played a promoting role. Therefore, it can be said that Wu Zetian was a great politician, a successful figure who should be greatly affirmed, not a failed figure.

    I think this opera is generally in line with historical facts, and affirming Wu Zetian is right and correct. However, major events and major activities should be handled well, and the primary and secondary must also be distinguished. I doubt whether the description of the trial in the play lowered Wu Zetian, portraying her as a Bao Gong-like figure? As a single act, it is acceptable, but using it to describe such a great figure as Wu Zetian is not powerful enough and lacks typical significance.

    The latter part of this play is also worth considering. Since it is a historical drama, it cannot violate the historical conditions of the time, and thoughts that were impossible at the time should not be forced upon her. Passing the throne to a son or a worthy person, whether Wu or Li, Wu Zetian had troubles and contradictions. But under the historical conditions at that time, not finding a member of the Li family or the Wu family to be emperor, but passing it on to someone with a different surname, this kind of thinking was impossible. This is too democratic, is bourgeois thinking, and such thinking was impossible in the feudal era.

    Also, taking Xu Jingye as a negative character, combining him with his grandfather Xu Ji, seems to have a problem in terms of age, because in the audience's view, this character is always an old man on stage. Writing Xu Jingye's opposition to Wu Zetian as a personal opposition may also be problematic, and it should be treated as a representative of the opposition. The Wu brothers, etc., are not written vividly enough, and inviting the emperor to dinner, using Xu Yougong as an accompanying guest, is also not an appropriate choice.

    The difficulty of the play is that the historical time is too long, and the clues of the characters are too long to be connected. Ultimately, the difficulty is caused by the way of writing in the form of annals. If the time is written shorter, or a certain period is selected, grasping the main events and vividly highlighting them, making it more vivid and powerful, it will be better.

### 历史的真实和艺术的真实

    历史的真实和艺术的真实
    今年，由为曹操翻案引起的讨论，不仅涉及到正确评价历史人物问题，同时也涉及到了有关古典小说“三国演义”、传统的三国戏的评价以及当代历史剧的创作实践问题，受到历史界和文艺界的重视。最近上海越剧院编演的新剧目“则天皇帝”，又涉及到了武则天的翻案问题，引起了历史界、文艺界的注意。“戏剧报”第二十期发表了一次座谈会上的发言，在这里，我们摘要发表了吴晗同志的发言。
    ——编者
    在过去时代，历史与历史戏剧有时是有矛盾的，比如我最近研究有关海瑞的戏，就看到有一些戏把张居正描写为叛臣，一家子都要造反，这些戏的主题是和客观存在的史实不符合的。这种歪曲既不能说服人，也不能改变历史事实。但是说明了一个道理，那就是确有些人对张居正某些政策不满，因而造谣攻击、诽谤、歪曲，这是反映某一时期政治斗争的一种表现。张居正其实是明代有名的权相，既没有造反，而且还的确做了一些好事。反映历史现实的戏剧，其中有一些是取材于历史事实的，有一些是根据民间传说来写的，而有一些却只是借用历史上知名的人物，夸张敷衍，成为戏剧。比如有关杨家将的戏，严格地说，很难说它们就是历史戏。因为除了杨业、杨延昭、杨文广是历史上确有其人以外，有关的许多故事都是虚构的。然而，仍然不失为好戏，因为这些戏表达了广大人民抵抗外来侵略的正义要求。潘仁美在戏中是一个坏人的典型，是杨家的对立面。历史上的潘美不是坏人，戏上的潘仁美却被写成人人痛恨的坏人。潘仁美不等于潘美，杨家将也不完全是历史戏。在这一点上，历史和戏剧是可以而且也应当区别开的。
    但是，如果要严格地写历史戏，那就不能不受历史的约束。假如基本上和历史事实相反，那就不能叫历史戏了。同时，作家也有创造人物和故事的自由。一出戏，如果一五一十都照历史写，或者照编年顺序写，不去分别主要次要，不作某些突出的夸张、渲染，而是和历史事实一模一样，那就变成历史，不是戏了，缺乏浪漫气氛，也就没有味道了。历史家没有权这样说：历史戏必须全部按照历史事实写；但是剧作家也没有权这样说：写历史戏可以完全不受客观存在的历史事实的约束。我看历史戏剧与历史的关系，应该是既有联系又有区别。有联系，是描写历史戏在大关节目上，应该基本符合于历史事实；有区别，是指戏剧家可以根据戏剧的需要，对题材作一些选择、改造，对情节作一些增减、渲染、夸张。写历史的人，不能用百分之百的真实去要求艺术（这样做，在历史家也是不可能的），但艺术所反映的历史基本事实总要和客观存在的史实大致不差。比如写武则天，同历史就要达到基本上的统一。历史上的好人应写成好人，坏人就要写成坏人，而不能好坏颠倒，是非不分（当然，某些被封建史家所歪曲颠倒的人物，应该重新估价。）
    在创作历史剧时，应该运用现实主义与浪漫主义相结合的方法，历史剧要求剧作家作现实主义的反映，反映人物的时代的真实，事件的真实，对人民进行爱国主义的历史教育；而艺术创作则须在现实主义的基础上，有夸张与创造，要运用浪漫主义的方法，要学习“矛盾论”，分清主要与次要，集中一点，照顾全面，达到艺术上的美满境界，收到教育的最好效果。在过去两者确实存在有矛盾，而今天，矛盾是可以统一的，可以解决的。并且通过艺术家的研究和讨论，历史戏将日益在人民群众中起越来越显著的教育作用。
    关于武则天的历史地位问题。武则天这个历史人物是丰富多采的、复杂的，又是伟大的。肯定这个人物是对的，我完全赞成。但“则天皇帝”的结尾，把她写成是一个失败的人物，说她输了，这就不太合适。从历史上看，结论不能这样下。作者究竟是从武则天的个别事件上来看问题，还是从她在那个时代起了进步作用这个主要方面来看问题呢？我认为武则天是一个成功的人物，不是一个悲剧性的人物。在唐代的历史上，唐太宗打下基础，接着是武则天时代，以后就是开元全盛时代。武则天当权前后的五十年间，生产发展了，土地开发了，人口增加了，疆土开扩了，文化提高了，和外国也有了广泛的交流。而且开元时代的主要政治家都是武则天时代所培养的。可以这样说，没有武则天时代长时期的巩固发展工作，开元的治世的局面是不可能出现的。当然，并不是说这一切都是武则天个人的功劳，但必须说她是起了促进作用的。因此，可以说，武则天是一个大政治家，是应该大加肯定的成功的人物，而不是失败的人物。
    我觉得这个戏大体上合乎历史事实，肯定武则天是对的、正确的。但是，主要事件，主要活动应该处理好，同时也必须分清主次。剧中关于审案的描写我怀疑是否降低了武则天，把她写成包公式的人物了？作为单折是可以的，但用来描写武则天这样伟大人物，却嫌力量不够了，也缺乏典型意义。
    这个戏的后一段也值得考虑。既然是历史戏，那就不能违反当时的历史条件，在当时所不可能有的思想，也不要强加于她。传子传贤，武乎李乎，武则天是有苦恼的，有矛盾的，她同狄仁杰是有斗争的。但在当时的历史条件下，不找李家人或武家人做皇帝，要传给外姓，这种思想是不可能产生的，这太民主了，是资产阶级思想，封建时代是不可能有这样思想的。
    还有，把徐敬业作为反面人物，把他和乃祖徐绩合起来，年龄上似有问题，因为在观众看来，这个人物在舞台上始终是个老头子。徐敬业的反对武则天写成是个人的反对，也可能有问题，应该处理成为反对派的代表。武氏弟兄等，都写得不鲜明，请皇帝吃饭，作陪客用徐有功也不是适当人选。
    戏的困难之处是历史时间太长，人物的线索太长，无法连贯起来，归根结底，造成困难的是编年史的写法。如果时间写短一点，还选取某一个时期，抓住主要事件，鲜明地烘托出来，使之更加生动、有力，那就会好一些。
