    Anti-American Tide Surges in America's "Backyard"
    Editor's Note: The American "Newsweek" published an article on November 16th entitled "Latin America, the Worst Anti-Americanism," which had to admit that the anti-American struggle of the Latin American people is unprecedentedly high. Excerpts are translated as follows:

    Panamanians hate the United States because it occupies the Canal Zone, which they consider their territory, has not paid all the rent they demand, and does not treat Panamanian workers in the Canal Zone equally. The prospect: more intense disturbances.

    Cubans hate the United States because Castro tells them that the United States is a ruthless imperialist exploiter and is hostile to them. His practice of violently attacking everything American continues to spread to neighboring countries. The prospect: increasing tension, crisis is imminent.

    Brazilians hate the United States because their politicians blame all of Brazil's economic difficulties on the United States, insisting that Washington is not helping them enough. The prospect: constant bickering.

    Venezuelans hate the United States because the United States occupies most of their oil and iron ore and—they denounce—exploits their country. The prospect: further squeezing of oil companies.

    South of the Border: A Roar
    From the cold deserts of Tierra del Fuego (at the southernmost tip of Argentina – translator's note) to the warm Caribbean Sea, shouts are ringing out: "Yankee, go home!" A wave of anti-Americanism, incited by nationalists and communists, is sweeping across the hemisphere. In some places, it is open and noisy, as shown by the riots in Panama last week and Castro's screaming hymns of hatred. The following news summarizes the situation in Panama, Cuba, Brazil and Venezuela. These countries are certainly the most intensely anti-American.

    Panama
    After the shooting fireworks dissipated, more than fifty policemen and firefighters were injured. About fifty Panamanians were attacked by gunfire and bayonets. The riots ended temporarily like this. However, the anger of the Panamanians will continue to burn unless the United States agrees to pay more canal usage fees and give Panamanian workers there the same wages and rights as Americans.

    Cuba
    Castro has ordered the press and radio to vigorously fire at the United States, especially the American press. This firepower is incessant day and night, appearing in angry speeches, editorials, cartoons, and columns.

    Naturally, what worries Americans the most is the new law to make it impossible for American companies to continue to exist in Cuba. These businessmen can only helplessly stand aside and let the government take away everything it can take without compensation—sugar cane plantations, pastures, mines.

    Castro's propaganda is very influential in the Caribbean.

    Brazil
    A Labor Party spokesman said at a meeting of the Brazilian Dockworkers' Union, "This situation should end: Brazilians brush their teeth with American toothbrushes, they use American electricity, use American refrigerators and cars, drink American beverages, and they watch American movies. In short, everything is American."

    Just as prices continue to rise and wages fall, when housewives have to pay more than double the price of a year ago to prepare a meal on the table, this kind of topic resounds throughout Brazil.

    Politicians are also like this, in order to get many votes from radical nationalists. This summer, a fiery reporter and lawyer, Louveira Fontes, gave a speech in the Senate that typically represented their anti-American accusations. He denounced the United States for "plundering" the Americas, "insidiously intervening" in Latin American oil, and "deliberately deepening" Brazil's coffee crisis.

    Under nationalist pressure, the government took over an American-owned electric power company and is threatening to take over another. Brazil is constantly attacking the Brazilian branches of American meat packing companies—Wilson, Armor, and Swift-Leaver Brothers. Brazil blames these companies for the extreme shortage of meat supply. They say that it is not their fault that ranchers are unwilling to sell cattle at the low prices set by the government.

    …Given that the 1960 presidential election is imminent, economic nationalism will certainly emerge.

    Venezuela
    Anti-American sentiment in Venezuela is focused on Venezuela's foreign—mainly American—oil companies, which provide two-thirds of the country's tax revenue. Communists and the left wing of the president's Democratic Action Party oppose American "harmful imperialists."

    The biggest blow to American oil companies is a newly formulated, retroactive import tax law, which was passed shortly before Betancourt became president last year, but was approved by him. This law increased the tax rate from 50% to 63%. According to Haight, the former general manager of Creole Petroleum Corporation, this law "greatly changed the climate for foreign investment." Betancourt is basically friendly to the United States, and Americans in Venezuela hope that he will stop it before the situation gets out of control. But American capital probably won't be as prosperous as it was before the current government came to power.

    Smaller anti-American actions have also erupted in Bolivia, Peru, Chile, and Guatemala. Putting these events together, it seems to be the same endlessly high rise of nationalism that has been experienced in Asia and Africa.

### 美国“后院”反美浪潮汹涌

专栏：外论摘要

    美国“后院”反美浪潮汹涌
    编者按：11月16日出版的美国“新闻周刊”刊载了一篇题为“拉丁美洲，最糟糕的反美主义”的文章，不得不承认拉丁美洲人民的反美斗争空前高涨。现摘译如下：
    巴拿马人憎恨美国，因为它占领了他们认为是他们的领土的运河区，没有交付他们所要求的全部租金，而且没有平等地对付运河区的巴拿马工人。前景是：更激烈的骚动。
    古巴人憎恨美国，因为卡斯特罗对他们说，美国是一个无情的帝国主义剥削者，对他们心怀敌意。他对美国每一件事情进行猛烈攻击的做法不断地扩到邻近的国家去。前景是：紧张日益加剧，危机迫在眉睫。
    巴西人憎恨美国，因为他们的政治家们把巴西所有的经济困难都归咎于美国，坚持认为华盛顿对他们帮助不够。前景是：吵个不停。
    委内瑞拉憎恨美国，因为美国占有他们的大部分石油和铁矿，而且——他们谴责说——对他们的国家进行剥削。前景是：更进一步榨取石油公司。
    边境以南：轰然而起
    从火地（在阿根廷最南端——译者注）寒冷的荒漠地带到暖和的加勒比海喊声四起：“美国佬，滚回老家去！”由民族主义者和共产党人煽起的反美主义的浪潮席卷着整个半球。在有些地方，它是公开而又大肆喧嚷的，上星期巴拿马的骚动和卡斯特罗的大叫大嚷充满憎恨的赞美诗中所表现的便是这样。下面的消息总结了巴拿马、古巴、巴西和委内瑞拉等国的形势。这些国家肯定都是反美最激烈的国家。
    巴拿马
    在射击的烟火消散以后，有五十多个警察和消防员受伤。约有五十个巴拿马人遭到了枪弹的袭击和刺刀的砍刺。暴动暂时就这样结束了。但是，巴拿马人的怒火还会燃烧，除非美国答应交付更多的运河使用费，并且给那里的巴拿马工人和美国人同等的工资和权利。
    古巴
    卡斯特罗已经命令报界和电台大力向美国开火，特别向美国报界。这种火力日夜不息，它出现在激怒的讲话中、社论、漫画和专栏文章里。
    自然而然最使美国人感到忧虑的，便是为了使美国在古巴的企业无法继续存在的新法律。这些商人只能无可奈何地呆在一旁，任凭政府无偿地夺走每一件它可以夺走的东西——甘蔗种植园、牧场、矿山。
    卡斯特罗的宣传在加勒比海地区非常有影响。
    巴西
    工党的一位发言者在巴西码头工人工会举行的一次会议上说，“这种情况该结束了：巴西人用美国牙刷刷牙，他们使用美国电力，使用美国冰箱和汽车，饮美国的饮料，他们看美国电影。总而言之，什么东西都是美国的。”
    正当价格不断上升、工资下降的时候，当家庭妇女们要付出超过双倍于一年前的价格才能在餐桌上准备一桌饭菜的时候，这样一类话题响彻了巴西全国。
    政治家们也是这样，为的是好让过激的民族主义者投他们许多选票。今年夏天，一个暴燥的记者兼律师洛维阿耳·丰特斯在参议院的讲话典型地代表了他们的反美指责。他谴责美国“掠夺”美洲各国、“阴险地插手”拉丁美洲的石油、“蓄意加深”巴西的咖啡危机。
    在民族主义的压力之下，政府接管了一家为美国人所有的电力公司，并正在扬言要接管另外一家公司。巴西正在不断进攻美国肉类包装公司设在巴西的分公司——威尔逊、阿莫和斯维夫特莱公司。巴西把肉类供应奇缺的情况归咎于这些公司。他们说，牧场主不愿按政府规定的低廉的价格售牛并非他们的过错。
    ……鉴于1960年的总统选举近在眼前，肯定会出现经济上的民族主义。
    委内瑞拉
    委内瑞拉的反美情绪集中表现在委内瑞拉对外国——主要是美国——的石油公司上，外国石油公司提供该国三分之二的税收。共产党人和总统的民主行动党内的左派反对美国“害人的帝国主义者”。
    对美国各石油公司最大的打击是一项新制定的、追溯到以前的进口税法，这项法律是在去年贝坦科尔特担任总统之前不久通过的，但是得到了他的同意。这项法律把税额从50％提高到63％。据克里奥尔石油公司的前总经理海特说，这项法律“大大改变了外国投资的气候。”贝坦科尔特基本上同美国是友好的，在委内瑞拉的美国人希望他将在局势失去控制之前加以制止。但是美国的资本大概不会再像现政府当政之前那样兴旺了。
    在玻利维亚、秘鲁、智利和危地马拉也有较小的反美行动爆发。把这些事件凑在一起，似乎同在亚洲和非洲一直经历着的民族主义是同样无休止地高涨。
