Indigenous Methods, From Local to Foreign, Fast Construction, Fast Growth
Chahuamiao—A Red Banner for Medium-Sized Iron Mines

(Our report) The Chahuamiao Iron Mine of the Lianyuan Iron and Steel Plant in Hunan Province entered 1960, and on November 9th, it overfulfilled its annual production plan of 260,000 tons of mining, fifty-two days ahead of schedule. The quality of ore is constantly rising, and costs are falling. The basic experience of the Chahuamiao Iron Mine is to implement the Party's policy of walking on two legs, fully mobilizing the masses, and relying on self-reliance; starting with indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, moving from indigenous to foreign, carrying out technical innovation on a large scale, breaking through the transportation barrier, and achieving cableway and rail transportation. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to their experience and believes that promoting their experience is of great importance to strengthening mine work and ensuring the continued leap forward in the iron and steel industry next year.

Self-Reliance Leads to High Speed
The Chahuamiao Iron Mine began construction in March of last year. Usually, it takes three years to build a mine with an annual output of 400,000 tons, but the Chahuamiao Iron Mine was completed in ten months. Moreover, construction and production took place simultaneously. Since September of last year, it has produced more than 360,000 tons of ore for the Lianyuan Iron and Steel Plant, meeting the needs of iron smelting. Before March of last year, this place was still a wilderness of mountains and ridges, with no machinery and equipment, no transportation, and only a little over a hundred technicians. Initially, all the tunneling was done with hand hammers, and the ore was carried down from the mountains hundreds of meters high on shoulders and backs. At first, some people saw these conditions and asserted: "The mine conditions are too poor, it is impossible to achieve a leap forward." However, the employees of the Chahuamiao Iron Mine, relying on self-reliance, moved from indigenous to foreign and built this mine, winning high speed.

Raising the Consciousness of New Workers
The mine originally planned to start production in 1959. In August and September of last year, Lian Steel made another leap, giving the mine a new task to supply 80,000 tons of ore in advance in 1958. The mine's Party General Branch bravely accepted this task. At that time, the biggest problems were: many new workers, relatively chaotic thinking, and low technical skills; slow tunneling and low shift efficiency. By September, only more than 3,000 meters had been completed. Under these circumstances, the Party General Branch of the mine first strengthened the political and ideological education of the workers. An education campaign focused on making the factory one's home and the five major relationships (individual and the country, individual and the collective, democracy and centralism, discipline and freedom, production and life) was carried out throughout the mine, quickly raising the ideological consciousness of the workers. On this basis, a high-efficiency competition movement to create new records was launched. As a result, by the end of the year, fifty-seven tunnels were opened, the annual tunneling plan was overfulfilled by two thousand meters, and the annual ore task was overfulfilled by two thousand tons. A crushing yard with an annual output of 400,000 tons was also built.

Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods, Vigorously Promoting Technical Innovation
Initially, the supply of equipment and materials was very tight. The entire mine had only one diesel air compressor and one electric air compressor, and the mine was located in high mountains and ridges, with only one highway connecting it to the outside world. Under these conditions, the employees of the Chahuamiao Iron Mine, in accordance with the Party's instructions, started with indigenous methods, relied on self-reliance, and vigorously promoted "small, indigenous, and mass" methods. For tunnels without ventilation equipment, they used natural ventilation and wooden blowers; for air ducts without foreign pipes, they used bamboo strips and oilcloth; for underground lighting without foreign electric lights, they made their own indigenous electric lights; for inclined shaft lifting without winches, they made their own indigenous winches; for lack of steel rails, they replaced them with wooden rails. They boldly broke many conventions and created more than thirty kinds of indigenous and indigenous-foreign mechanical equipment and parts. The successful trial production of a series of indigenous machinery solved two ideological problems for the employees: first, they deeply realized the correctness of the Party's self-reliance policy; second, their minds were greatly liberated, and they boldly did many things that they had never dared to think of in the past.

Achieving Cableway and Rail Transportation
After the high yield of ore was achieved, the transportation bottleneck became prominent. At that time, more than half of the mine's five thousand workers were engaged in transportation, but the ore on the mountain was still piled up like a mountain, the crushing yard was not getting enough material, and the blast furnace was in danger of running out of supplies.

The Party General Branch promptly put forward the slogan of "Cableways on the mountains and vehicles on the plains." The General Branch Secretary and the workers of the cableway group, such as Jiang Yan'cheng, discussed and, imitating the principle of train brake, created a braking device for the original cableway, which had a very low transportation efficiency. Because of the flexible control, the cableway's carrying capacity increased from six to eight baskets to twenty-two baskets each time, and the shift efficiency increased from eight tons to ninety-three tons.

Soon, vehicle transportation on the plains was implemented. In thirteen days, 2,187 meters of wooden track were built, fulfilling the promise of "eliminating shoulder carrying." The number of transportation workers was reduced by more than 1,400, and the labor intensity of the workers was greatly reduced.

The mine also trained a large number of skilled workers. Now the entire mine has a strong technical workforce of more than 700 people. They adopted a combination of on-site teaching and classroom lessons. New workers first did ground transportation to familiarize themselves with the situation, and then went into the tunnels to work; at the same time, they registered the three artisans (wood, saw, bamboo) as the backbone of the technicians to be trained first; because there were few old technicians, they used the method of one teacher with multiple apprentices and senior brothers helping junior brothers to train in batches. After learning the basic skills, they boldly let the apprentices operate independently.

Moving Towards Mechanization and Modernization
In the future, this mine will continue to leap forward at an even faster speed. Currently, construction is underway on a fully mechanized vertical shaft, and inclined shafts and horizontal adits will also be built. After completion, the designed production capacity will be increased from the current 400,000 tons to 600,000 tons. Next year, mining will be fully mechanized, and part of the transportation inside the tunnels and to the crushing yard will use electric locomotives; the crushing yard will add sixteen jaw crushers, increasing the crushing capacity from the current 400,000 tons to 600,000 tons. To meet this need, the railway from Tianhu to Huangnitang (Lian Steel) will be laid with double tracks. In this way, this mine will produce more and better ore to supply the needs of the Lianyuan Iron and Steel Plant. (Attached picture)

    土法上马　由土到洋　建设快　成长快
    插花庙—中型铁矿一面红旗
    本报讯　湖南省涟源钢铁厂插花庙铁矿跨进1960年，在11月9日提前五十二天超额完成了全年采矿二十六万吨的生产计划，矿石质量不断上升，成本下降。插花庙铁矿的基本经验是执行党的两条腿走路的方针，充分发动群众，自力更生；土法上马，土洋结合，由土到洋，大搞技术革新，突破运输关，实现索道化、轨道化。中共湖南省委很重视他们的经验，认为推广他们的经验，对加强矿山工作，保证明年钢铁工业继续跃进有重要的作用。
      自力更生速度高
    插花庙铁矿是去年3月开始建设的。通常建设这样一座年产四十万吨的矿山，需要三年时间，而插花庙铁矿却在十个月内建成了。而且，边基建、边生产，从去年9月到现在，已为涟源钢铁厂生产了三十六万多吨矿砂，满足了炼铁需要。去年3月以前，这里还是荒山峻岭，没有机器设备，没有交通工具，技工只有一百多个，最初掘进全靠手锤，从数百米的山上运矿下来全凭肩挑背负。当初有人看到这些条件就断言：“矿山条件太差，根本不可能跃进。”然而，插花庙铁矿的职工自力更生，由土到洋，建成了这座矿山，赢得了高速度。
    提高新工人的觉悟
    矿山原计划1959年投入生产。去年8、9月，涟钢一跃再跃，给矿山提出了一项新任务，要提前在1958年供应出八万吨矿砂。矿党总支勇敢地接受了这一任务。当时，最大的问题是：新工人多，思想比较乱，技术低；掘进慢，台班效率低，到9月份，只完成进尺三千多米。在这种情况下，矿山党总支首先加强了对工人的政治思想教育。在全矿范围内开展了一个以厂为家和五大关系（个人与国家、个人与集体、民主与集中、纪律与自由、生产与生活）的教育，很快地提高了工人的思想觉悟，在这个基础上，开展了一个创造新纪录的高工效竞赛运动。结果，到年底止，开辟了五十七个窿道，超额二千米完成了全年的掘进计划，超额二千吨完成了全年的矿砂任务。还建成了一座年产四十万吨的破碎场。
  土洋结合　大闹技术革新
    最初，设备材料的供应很紧张。全矿只有一台柴油压风机，一台电动压风机，矿山又地处高山峻岭，仅有一条公路和外面相通。在这种条件下，插花庙铁矿的职工，按照党所指示的方针，土法上马，自力更生，大搞“小、土、群”。窿道没有通风设备，就利用自然通风和木制鼓风机；没有风管，就用竹篾油布作风管；井下照明没有洋电灯，就自制土电灯；斜井提升没有卷扬机，就自制土卷扬机；没有钢轨，就以木轨代替。他们大胆打破了许多陈规，创造了三十多种土的和土洋结合的机械设备和部件。一连串土机械的试制成功，解决了职工思想上两个问题：第一是深刻体会到党提出的自力更生的方针的正确；第二是大大解放了思想，大胆搞了许多自己过去想都不敢想的东西。
    实现索道化　轨道化
    矿砂高产关突破以后，运输关就突出了。当时，全矿五千多个工人，有一大半是搞运输的，但山上的矿砂却仍堆积如山，破碎场吃不饱，高炉有断粮的危险。
    党总支及时提出了“高山索道化、平地车子化”的号召。总支书记与索道组的工人蒋炎成等商量，将原来运输效率很低的索道，仿照火车制动闸的原理，搞了一个刹车装置，由于控制灵便，索道每次的运载量由过去的六至八筐增加到二十二筐，台班效率由过去的八吨提高到九十三吨。
    不久，又实行了平地车子化，十三天时间，修起了二千一百八十七米木轨道，实现“消灭扁担挑”的诺言。运输工人却减了一千四百多人，工人的劳动强度也大大减轻。
    矿山还培养了大批技术工人。现在全矿已拥有一支七百多人的强大的技术工人队伍。他们采取现场教学和上课相结合的办法，新工人先做地面运输，熟悉情况，然后进窿道干活；同时，登记三匠（木、锯、竹）作为最先训练的技工的骨干；因老技工少，就用一师多徒、师兄帮师弟的办法分批训练。学到基本技术以后，就大胆让徒工单独操作。
    向机械化　现代化迈进
    今后，这座矿山将以更快的速度继续跃进。目前，正动工兴建一座完全机械化的竖井，还将兴建斜井和平窿，建成以后，设计生产能力就要从现在的四十万吨提高到六十万吨。明年，采矿要完全实现机械化，窿内和到破碎场将采用部分电机车运输；破碎场将增添十六部鄂式破碎机，使破碎能力由现在的四十万吨达到六十万吨。适应这一需要，由田湖到黄泥塘（涟钢）的铁道将铺成双轨。这样，这座矿山将生产更多更好的矿砂供应涟源钢铁厂的需要。（附图片）
