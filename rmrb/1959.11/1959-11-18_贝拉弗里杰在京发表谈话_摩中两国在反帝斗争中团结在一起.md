Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: Former Moroccan Prime Minister Bella Frej, who is currently visiting Beijing, told Xinhua reporters today that the common struggle against imperialism and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference have united the Moroccan and Chinese people.

Bella Frej said that the current relations between Morocco and China are good. Our two countries established diplomatic relations last year, and economic relations existed between us even before the establishment of diplomatic relations. According to the current possibilities of economic exchange, economic cooperation between Morocco and China is very promising.

He said that Morocco and China have common ground in history. We have suffered the disasters that China once suffered, namely the oppression of colonialism and the exploitation of feudalism. He pointed out that although Morocco and China have chosen different paths, China adheres to solidarity with Asian and African countries, and the Chinese people support the struggles of Asian and African people to liberate themselves. Morocco can learn from the experience of the Chinese revolution. Bella Frej expressed his support for the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. He said, we have always believed that China, with its 650 million people, cannot be ignored, and depriving the Chinese people of their legitimate rights in the United Nations is wrong.

When talking about the Moroccan people's struggle to withdraw foreign troops and abolish foreign military bases from their territory, Bella Frej said, we are fighting for the complete and thorough withdrawal of American, French, and Spanish troops stationed in Morocco. The Moroccan people have also expressed their will that foreign military bases on Moroccan soil will be taken back sooner or later. He also said that Morocco is fighting for the complete independence of its economy. When talking about the struggle of the African people, the former Prime Minister said, I sincerely say that the Chinese revolution has awakened the African continent. The African people have awakened, and they will occupy their land in the sunlight. Bella Frej also talked about his impressions of visiting China, praising China's construction achievements in all aspects.

    贝拉弗里杰在京发表谈话
    摩中两国在反帝斗争中团结在一起
    新华社17日讯　正在北京访问的摩洛哥前首相贝拉弗里杰，今天向新华社记者发表谈话说，反对帝国主义的共同斗争，以及万隆会议的十项原则，已经把摩洛哥和中国人民团结在一起。
    贝拉弗里杰说，目前摩洛哥和中国之间的关系是良好的。去年我们两国建立了外交关系，在建立外交关系之前，我们之间的经济关系就已经存在了。根据目前经济交流的可能性看，摩洛哥和中国的经济合作是大有前途的。
    他说，摩中两国历史上就有共同的地方，我们遭受过中国曾经遭受过的灾难，那就是殖民主义的压迫和封建的剥削。他指出，尽管摩中两国选择的道路不同，但是中国坚持和亚非各国的团结，中国人民支持亚非人民解放自己的斗争，摩洛哥可以从中国革命的经验中吸取教益。贝拉弗里杰表示支持恢复中国在联合国的合法权利。他说，我们一直认为六亿五千万人民的中国是不容忽视的，剥夺中国人民在联合国的合法权利是不对的。
    在谈到摩洛哥人民要求从自己的领土上撤出外国驻军和撤消外国军事基地的斗争时，贝拉弗里杰说，我们正在为完全地彻底地撤退驻扎在摩洛哥的美国、法国和西班牙的军队而斗争。摩洛哥人民也已经表达了这样的意志：摩洛哥土地上的外国军事基地是迟早要收回来的。他还说，摩洛哥正在为自己经济的完全独立进行着斗争。谈到非洲人民的斗争时，这位前首相说，我诚恳地说，中国的革命唤醒了非洲大陆。非洲人民觉醒了，他们将在太阳光下占有自己的土地。贝拉弗里杰还谈到了访问中国的观感，盛赞中国各方面的建设成就。
