    (Report from our newspaper) The employees of the Shanghai Knitwear Procurement and Supply Station, under the leadership of the Party committee, have continuously broken old practices and innovated, achieving new experiences in developing industrial and commercial cooperation methods, strengthening the connection between production and sales plans, improving acquisition pricing, improving product quality, and expanding varieties. They have successfully completed various tasks. The state-assigned annual procurement and supply plans have been completed 99 days and 131 days ahead of schedule, respectively.

    Resident Procurement, Work Becoming More In-Depth
    The "Six-On-Site" procurement system centered on "resident procurement" (on-site procurement, inspection, work and rest, pricing, allocation of funds, and delivery) was a product of the Great Leap Forward in Shanghai's commercial procurement and supply departments last year. Over the past year, this station has been implementing this system and continuously improving it. They have changed the past practice where factories had to gather the full quantity of various colors, varieties, and specifications listed on the transaction order before delivering goods. Now, as long as the goods meet the acquisition requirements and are packaged, they issue transaction orders with corresponding quantities, colors, varieties, and specifications based on actual production and ship them immediately. After implementation, the time from product completion to shipment has been shortened by another one to two days, and factory finished products can generally be shipped to various places the next day, accelerating commodity circulation.

    They have also adopted the method of establishing resident procurement work groups by dividing areas, targeting the characteristics of many industrial households, small factories, dispersed areas, and multiple varieties produced by a single factory. They frequently go deep into workshops, becoming one with the workers, not only serving as good "logistics" personnel, assisting factories in regulating raw materials and solving the needs for miscellaneous materials, but also loving the factory like their own home, participating in production, promoting production, and further strengthening the brotherly cooperation between industry and commerce.
  
  Serving as Industrial Advisors, Assisting in Overcoming Production Difficulties
    Shanghai's knitwear industry has many small and medium-sized factories and non-full-capacity factories, and the production capacities of various links such as weaving, dyeing, and sewing are quite unbalanced. In the leap forward in production, this contradiction has become more prominent. For some factories, solving this disconnection has become a key to whether production and acquisition tasks can be achieved. In the second quarter of this year, the output of woven fabrics and sewing in four weaving factories, including Dacheng, rose steadily, but the dyeing production of Xieping Dyeing Factory could not keep up. Resident procurement staff learned that Xieping Dyeing Factory lacked drying equipment on the one hand, and on the other hand, the different colors delivered by various weaving factories every day increased the number of color changes and re-vatting, which also affected the improvement of dyeing production. Therefore, they actively promoted cooperation among relevant factories. Finally, under the leadership of the industry's Party general branch, they adjusted the dyeing plan, changing the original dyeing method to batch and centralized dyeing of similar colors from each factory, which not only maintained the original dyeing varieties but also reduced color changes and re-vatting. At the same time, they helped solve the problem of some drying equipment, and the factory workers improved their operating techniques. Xieping Factory's dyeing output increased by 20%, basically adapting to the weaving needs and ensuring the completion of the acquisition task.

    The More That Is Needed, the More the Goods Must Be Right
    Knitwear has a wide variety of colors and complex specifications. Connecting the different and frequently changing needs of the people in urban and rural areas across the country with the production of hundreds of factories in Shanghai is a very detailed and complex organizational task. In recent years, the connection between production and sales plans for knitwear has been continuously strengthened, but situations of imbalance and mismatched goods still frequently occur. In the face of the unprecedented increase in market demand for knitwear this year, the station's employees were determined to break through this key. As they aptly put it: "The more that is needed, the more the goods must be right, no matter how changeable, as long as industry and commerce are well combined." After a series of consultations, practices, and organizational preparations, with the support and cooperation of industrial departments, they gradually explored a set of "three combinations" experience centered on strengthening the connection between production and sales plans:

    (1) Industry-Commerce Combination: Establish an industry-commerce cooperation group to be responsible for connecting production and sales plans and arranging factory production.
    (2) Production-Sales Combination: In the process of formulating plans, not only fully consider the needs and possibilities of production and consumption, but also jointly hold production-supply-sales meeting with factories, procurement stations, secondary stations, and retail stores to communicate production and sales information and make the plans more reasonable.
    (3) Top-Down Combination: First, the procurement and supply station and the industrial company propose the overall task from top to bottom, and then the resident staff and the factory propose specific arrangements for colors, varieties, and specifications from bottom to top. Finally, the industry-commerce cooperation group balances and determines them to ensure that they meet the requirements of the national plan, adapt to market needs, and take care of the factory's specific production conditions, giving full play to production potential.

    Now, they have put forward a new leap forward goal of completing an annual procurement value that is 40% higher than last year. A new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy, centered on "vigorously grasping purchasing and doing a good job in peak season supply," has been vigorously launched throughout the station.

### 上海针棉织品采购供应站工作越作越好  工商一条心　生产采购双跃进

    上海针棉织品采购供应站工作越作越好
    工商一条心　生产采购双跃进
    本报讯　上海针棉织品采购供应站职工在党委领导下，不断破旧创新，在发展工商协作方式，加强产销计划衔接，改进收购作价，提高产品质量和扩大花色品种等方面，取得了不少新的经验，出色地完成了各项任务。国家下达的全年采购、供应计划，已分别提前九十九天和一百三十一天完成。
    驻厂采购，工作愈做愈深入
    以“驻厂采购”为中心的“六就”采购制度（就厂采购、检验、作息、核价、拨款、发货），是上海商业采购供应部门去年大跃进的产物。一年多来，这个站一直执行着这个制度，并且不断有所改进。他们把过去工厂必须凑足成交单所列各种花色、品种、规格的全部数量以后才能交货的作法，改为只要符合收购要求，包装成件，随时按实际生产，开出相应数量、花色、品种、规格的成交单，立即发运。实行以后，商品从制成到发运又缩短了一、二天时间，工厂成品一般隔天就能发往各地，加速了商品流转。
    他们又针对有关工业户多、厂小、地区分散和一厂多品种的特点，采取了划区设立驻厂采购工作组的办法。他们经常深入车间，和工人打成一片，不仅当好“后勤”，协助工厂调剂原料，解决零星物料需要，而且爱厂如家，参与生产，促进生产，更加密切了工商之间的兄弟协作关系。
  当工业参谋，协助克服生产困难
    上海针棉织品工业，中小型厂、非全能厂多，织坯、漂染、缝纫等各个环节生产能力很不平衡。生产跃进中，这种矛盾显得更加突出。对于有些工厂说来，解决这种脱节现象就成为能否实现生产和收购任务的一个关键。今年第二季度，内衣业中大诚等四个织造厂织坯和缝纫的产量节节上升，但协平漂染厂的染色生产却跟不上。驻厂采购员了解到漂染厂一方面烘干设备不足，同时各个织造厂每天交染颜色不一致，增多了换色翻缸次数，也影响漂染生产的提高。因此，他们就积极推动有关工厂加强协作，终于在行业党总支领导下，调整了交染计划，把原来的交染办法，改为各厂同类颜色分批集中交染，既保持了原有的染色品种，又减少了换色翻缸；同时又协助解决了部分烘干设备，工厂工人又改进了操作技术，协平厂的漂染产量就提高了20％，基本上适应了织造需要，保证了收购任务的完成。
    愈是要的多，愈要货对路
    针棉织品花色繁多，规格复杂。把全国城乡人民千差万别、经常多变的需求，同上海几百家工厂的生产衔接起来，是一项十分细致复杂的组织工作。几年来，针棉织品的产销计划衔接工作不断有所加强，但是具体品种上顾此失彼、货不对路的情况还经常存在；在今年针棉织品市场需要空前增加的形势下，这个站的职工立志要突破这个关键。他们说得好：“愈是要的多，愈要货对路，那怕千变万化，只要工商结合好”。经过了一系列的协商、实践和组织准备，终于在工业部门的支持配合下，逐步摸索到了一套以加强产销计划衔接为中心的“三结合”的经验：
    （1）工商结合：成立工商协作小组，统一负责衔接产销计划，安排工厂生产。
    （2）产销结合：商订计划过程中，不仅充分考虑到生产、消费的需要与可能，还联合召开工厂、采供站、二级站、零售店的产供销见面座谈会，沟通产销情况，把计划安排得更加合理。
    （3）上下结合：先由采供站与工业公司由上而下提出总的任务，又由驻厂员与工厂由下而上提出具体花色、品种、规格的安排意见，最后由工商协作小组平衡确定，做到既符合国家计划要求，适应市场需要，又照顾工厂具体生产条件，充分发挥生产潜力。
    现在，他们又提出了完成年度采购总值比去年增长40％的新的跃进目标。一个以“大抓进货，做好旺季供应”为中心的增产节约新高潮已在全站范围内蓬勃地开展起来。
