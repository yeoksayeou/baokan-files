    Vanguard on the Production Front
    The Vietnamese people's own army—the People's Army—are heroes in combat and experts in production. In recent years, the People's Army has continuously sent units to the agricultural production front, contributing their strength and setting an example for increasing grain production. The An Khánh People's Army Farm, established in 1956, is a model unit on Vietnam's agricultural front.
    This year, after overcoming drought, the farm reaped a bountiful harvest of grain. During the harvest season, the golden fields reverberated day and night with the roar of tractors, the laughter of soldiers, and songs. To harvest the grain in a timely manner, competitions were launched between teams and individuals, and ten out of the twelve production teams won the red banner of excellence. They not only completed the original harvest target but also greatly exceeded it.
    The cooks of the production teams also launched a red banner competition, ensuring that the soldiers fighting in the fields had hot meals and hot tea. The heroic and tenacious spirit that the soldiers displayed in the past on the battlefield against the enemy is now visible everywhere in the fields.
    Because of the farm's bumper grain harvest, workers and residents from nearby areas came to visit the farm, carefully observing the growth of the crops and the bundles of harvested rice. They praised: "The grain harvested by the soldiers is truly full and plump. You are proficient in everything. You are not only heroes in fighting the enemy, but also experts on the production front. You have both collective labor and advanced production technology. No wonder you have achieved such a great harvest!"
    The average grain yield of this farm is 5.6 tons per hectare, which is much higher than that of ordinary farmland. Due to the abundant grain harvest, some granaries had to be added. The farm manager said: "This is just our beginning. In the early days of establishing our farm, we encountered many difficulties. Take last year, for example, we only harvested an average of 1.3 tons of grain per hectare, while individual farmers harvested 2 tons per hectare. But we did not lose confidence. We made greater efforts, overcame many difficulties, and achieved such good results. We are not satisfied with the little achievements we have made so far, and we will learn from the good example of the people's armies of fraternal countries to continuously increase production. Now the farm has started sowing grain for this winter and next spring, and is preparing 5,000 tons of fertilizer. We will also use the most advanced technology to harvest next year's crops. We will apply an average of 15 tons of fertilizer to each hectare of land. This is the goal of our farm's competition, and we will definitely achieve it."

    生产战线上的尖兵
    越南人民的子弟兵——人民军，战斗上是英雄，生产上是能手。近年来，人民军不断派出一些部队走上农业生产战线，为增加粮食产量，献出了力量，树立了榜样。像1956年建立的安庆人民军农场，就是越南农业战线上的一支标兵队伍。
    今年，这个农场在战胜了干旱以后，谷物获得了丰收。在收割季节，金黄色的田野上日夜响彻着拖拉机的轰响、战士们的欢笑声和歌声。为了及时收割谷物，队与队和人与人之间开展了竞赛，在十二个生产队中，有十个生产队获得了优胜红旗。他们不仅完成了原订的收割指标，而且大大地超额完成了任务。
    生产队的炊事员们也开展了红旗竞赛，保证让战斗在田野上的战士们吃到热饭、喝到热茶。战士们过去在战场上抗敌的英勇顽强精神，现在在田间也到处可见。
    由于农场谷物丰收，附近的工人和居民们都来参观访问农场，仔细地观察了农作物生长情况和一捆捆收割下来的稻子。他们称赞说：“战士们所收获的谷物真是粒粒丰满，你们真是样样精通，你们不仅是打击敌人的英雄，也是生产战线上的能手；你们既是集体劳动，又有先进的生产技术，难怪你们获得了这么大的丰收！”
    这个农场平均每公顷谷物收获量为五点六吨，比一般农田高出很多。由于谷物丰收，不得不添建一些粮仓。农场场长说：“这仅仅是我们的开始。在我们建立农场初期，也曾遇到了不少困难，就拿去年来说吧，我们平均每公顷才打一点三吨谷物，而当时个体农民每公顷收获量就达两吨。但是我们并没有失掉信心，我们作了更大的努力，克服了重重困难，才获得了这样良好的成绩。我们并不满足于目前所取得的这一点儿成绩，还要学习兄弟国家人民军队的优良榜样，使生产量不断增加。现在农场已经开始今冬明春谷物的播种，并准备五千吨肥料，还要用最先进的技术来收割明年的庄稼，我们要在每一公顷土地上平均施肥十五吨，这是我们农场竞赛的目标，我们一定能胜利实现的。”
