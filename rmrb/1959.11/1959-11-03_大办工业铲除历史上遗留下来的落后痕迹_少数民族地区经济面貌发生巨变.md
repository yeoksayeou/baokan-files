Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: The industrial construction in the minority areas across the country continues to leap forward with heroic strides, and the economic landscape of these areas is constantly changing.

A high rate of development is a common feature of industrial production in various ethnic regions this year. The more than thirty small and medium-sized steel and iron plants in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region completed the region's annual pig iron production plan by early September, with an output increase of more than six times compared to last year; the steel production target will also be completed ahead of schedule. In addition to steel, petroleum, and other factories and mines, the autonomous region has also built large-scale textile, sugar making, leather making, and flour processing industries. The people's communes have also established more than 18,000 small factories serving agricultural and pastoral production. At present, the total industrial output value of the autonomous region accounts for more than 40% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region only started its iron and steel industry in the mass movement of iron and steelmaking last year, but from January to August this year, the self-produced and self-used pig iron reached more than 38,000 tons. The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, which had just gotten rid of the "not having an inch of iron" situation not long ago, has begun to transition from small native furnaces to small blast furnaces in its metallurgical industry and has built the Shizuishan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise with an annual output of 50,000 tons of steel. The coal industry in the autonomous region is developing rapidly, and it is expected that the output of raw coal this year will increase by more than double compared to last year. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the steel output in August this year had already exceeded the total steel output of the entire year last year, and many small and medium-sized steelmaking and ironmaking bases have been established on the basis of "small native groups." Baotou Steel, the first large-scale modern steel base established by the state in minority areas, also began producing iron on the 10th anniversary of the National Day. The industrial production in the Linxia and Gannan Autonomous Prefectures and Tianzhu, Sunan, and Qingshui Autonomous Counties in Gansu Province has shown a great situation of continued leap forward.

The industries in the minority areas have begun to provide the people of all ethnic groups with agricultural and pastoral machinery, new-style tools, pesticides, chemical fertilizers, etc., which has strongly supported agricultural and pastoral production. Two modern large-scale machinery factories and one hundred and twenty-one local agricultural and pastoral and general machinery factories in Inner Mongolia are fighting for the technical transformation of agriculture and animal husbandry in the autonomous region. In some minority areas of Guizhou Province, there wasn't even a blacksmith shop before, and it would take several days to cross mountains and ridges to buy a piece of iron farm tool. Now, they have smelted steel to arm themselves. In the first eight months of this year, the QianDongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture produced more than 1.3 million pieces of agricultural tools. Most of the steel drills and sledgehammers needed for water conservancy construction in the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture are now locally made. The pig iron produced in Qinghai this year has been used to make a batch of native iron rails and more than 600,000 pieces of agricultural and pastoral machinery, which has been supplied to local farmers and herdsmen in a timely manner. During the severe drought this year, the mechanical workers of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture broke superstitions and used the method of ants gnawing bones to produce a batch of water pumps, electric motors, and water pumps, creating a miracle unprecedented in the history of the autonomous prefecture, and powerfully supporting the drought resistance struggle of the farmer brothers. From October last year to October this year, the steel produced in the autonomous prefecture has been made into more than 2.54 million pieces of various farm tools, with an average of one to two pieces per rural laborer; the chemical fertilizers produced average more than 30 kilograms per mu of rice field; and the pesticides produced average more than 7 kilograms per mu of rice field.

The emerging industries have promoted drastic changes in the farming system of some ethnic minorities. After more than 40 factories and mines were built in the Cangyuan Va Autonomous County on the distant Yunnan border, the wooden sticks, stone axes, and other tools used by the Va people for a long time have been generally replaced by iron plows and iron hoes, completely changing the primitive farming methods of slash-and-burn cultivation of this nation. The "two-ox plow" and "back bucket" commonly used in the rural areas of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are gradually being replaced by new-style step plows and various vehicles. Farm tool factories have also been established in the Wuzhi Mountain area of Hainan Island, and the backward farming methods of the Li people of "cattle treading fields" and "hand twisting ears of grain" are no longer seen.

In the development of industry, the people of all ethnic groups have also established their own light industries by using local materials and local production. The variety of light industrial and handicraft products in Qinghai has increased from more than 500 in 1957 to more than 2,000 now, and more than 700 products such as matches and soaps have been able to be self-sufficient.

    大办工业铲除历史上遗留下来的落后痕迹
    少数民族地区经济面貌发生巨变
    据新华社1日讯　全国少数民族地区的工业建设，正在以豪迈的步伐继续跃进，这些地区的经济面貌正在不断地发生变化。
    高速度的发展，是今年各个民族地区工业生产共同的特点。新疆维吾尔自治区的三十多个中小型钢铁厂和炼铁厂，在9月初就完成了今年全区生铁的生产计划，产量比去年增长六倍多；钢的生产指标也将提前完成。自治区除了钢铁、石油等厂矿外，还建起大型的纺织、制糖、制革、面粉加工等工业，各人民公社也建立一万八千多座为农牧业生产服务的小型工厂。现在，自治区的工业总产值，已占工农业总产值的40％以上。广西僮族自治区在去年大炼钢铁的群众运动中，才开创钢铁工业的历史，而今年从1月到8月，自产自用的生铁即达三万八千多吨。不久前刚摆脱“手无寸铁”状况的宁夏回族自治区，冶金工业已开始从以小土炉过渡到小高炉，并兴建了年产五万吨钢的石咀山钢铁联合企业。自治区的煤炭工业正在飞跃发展，预计今年原煤产量将比去年增长一倍以上。内蒙古自治区今年的钢铁产量，早在8月份就超过去年全年钢铁产量的总和，并且在“小土群”的基础上建立了许多炼钢炼铁的中小型基地。国家在少数民族地区建立的第一个大型现代化的钢铁基地——包钢，也已经在国庆十周年开始出铁。甘肃省临夏、甘南两自治州和天祝、肃南、清水等自治县，工业生产都出现了继续跃进的大好局面。
    少数民族地区的工业，已开始向各民族人民提供农牧业机械、新式工县和农药、化学肥料等等，有力地支援了农牧业生产。内蒙古的两座现代化的大型机械厂、一百二十一座地方农牧业和通用的机械厂，正在为自治区农牧业的技术改造而奋战。贵州省有些少数民族地区，以前连个铁匠铺都没有，买件铁质农具要翻山越岭走上好几天，现在，他们炼出了钢铁来武装自己。黔东南苗族侗族自治州在今年头八个月内，就制出了农具和工具一百三十多万件。黔南布依族苗族自治州现在兴修水利所需的钢钎和大锤，绝大部分是本地制造的。青海今年所产的生铁，已经用来制出了一批土铁轨和六十多万件农牧机具，及时地供应了当地农牧民。湘西土家族苗族自治州的机械工人，在今年特大干旱期间，打破迷信，用蚂蚁啃骨头的办法，制出一批水泵、电动机和抽水机等，创造了自治州历史上从未有过的奇迹，有力地支援了农民兄弟的抗旱斗争。从去年10月到今年10月自治州生产出来的钢铁，已制成各种农具二百五十四万多件，平均每个农村劳动力有一件到两件；生产的化学肥料平均每亩稻田三十多斤；制出的农药平均每亩稻田七斤多。
    新兴的工业，促使有些少数民族的耕作制度发生了急剧的变化。远处云南边疆的沧源佧佤族自治县，建起四十多个厂矿后，佧佤人长期使用的木棒、石斧等工具，已普遍换成铁犁铧、铁锄头，彻底改变了这个民族刀耕火种的原始耕作方法。宁夏回族自治区农村普遍使用的“二牛抬杠”和“背斗”，正逐步由新式步犁和各种车辆所代替。海南岛的五指山区也办起了农具厂，黎族人民“牛踩田”、“手捻穗”的落后的耕作方法，再也看不到了。
    在工业发展中，各族人民还就地取材、就地生产，建立了自己的轻工业。青海轻工业和手工业产品的品种，由1957年的五百多种，增加到现在的两千多种，火柴、肥皂等七百多种产品已能够自给。
