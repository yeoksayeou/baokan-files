    Reading and Work
    Zhang Haoran
    I often hear people say: "I'm too busy with work and don't have time to read." Or "So-and-so only cares about reading and doesn't care about work." This reflects the contradiction between reading and work.
    Reading and work are contradictory because they are two different things. But they are also unified because reading is for the purpose of improving one's political and theoretical level, ideological level, and increasing professional and technical knowledge. Ultimately, it is still for the purpose of doing a good job. Therefore, the two are both contradictory and unified, "opposing and complementing each other."
    Of course, reading takes time, and the contradiction between reading and work often manifests itself in terms of time. When work is busy, tasks are urgent, and there are many practical problems that need to be dealt with, it is often easy to squeeze out time for reading. From the phenomenon, time is the focus of the contradiction here, and rationally adjusting the time for reading and work becomes the main link in resolving the contradiction. But the essence of the problem is not here; the essence of the problem lies in correctly understanding the unity of reading and work. The busier a person's work is, the more affairs and problems need to be dealt with, the more one needs to have a higher level of thought and a broader and more open perspective, which cannot be achieved by thinking hard alone, but must be achieved by reading to improve cognitive ability. In order to have correct thinking methods and working methods, so as to identify the direction of progress in complex phenomena and find the essence of contradictions and methods to resolve them, it is necessary to read some philosophy books; in order to master and utilize objective economic laws and do economic work well, so that economic work becomes more and more detailed, it is necessary to read books on political economy; in order to master the knowledge and laws of the work of a department and do the work of a department well, it is also necessary to carefully study the Party's policies and guidelines, read important documents and some books on relevant professional and technical knowledge; and so on.
    Chairman Mao said in "On Practice": "All genuine knowledge originates in direct experience. But no one can have direct experience of everything; in fact, most knowledge comes from indirect experience, that is, all ancient and foreign knowledge." Where does ancient and foreign knowledge come from? Only by reading. A person's contact surface is limited, and a person's own experience is not enough, not to mention that old experience cannot be completely used to solve new problems. Socialist construction is a complex whole, and the work of each person is closely related to the work of others, and the work of each department is closely related to the work of other departments. For example, to do a good job in the distribution of social products, it is necessary to understand the situation of production and consumption; to do a good job in production, it is also necessary to understand the requirements of distribution and consumers; to produce a certain product, it is also necessary to understand the status and role of this product in socialist construction; consumption must also adapt to the situation of production and distribution. Therefore, it is difficult to do one's own work well if one only understands one's own work, only understands the work of one's own department, does not understand the work of others and other departments, and only sees the part and not the whole. Reading not only increases our knowledge and broadens our horizons, but also helps us to summarize experience and enables us to understand the laws of objective things. In economic life, various economic laws are objectively playing a role. For example, in socialist society, there are the basic economic law of socialism, the law of planned and proportionate development, the law of commodity and value, the law of distribution according to work, etc., all of which are independent of people's will. If a person engaged in economic work knows nothing about the role of these laws, he will not only be unable to adapt to these laws and use these laws to do his work well, but will also make mistakes in his work; conversely, if he has this knowledge, it can help us to correctly understand objective things, find the main link of the contradiction of things, and master and utilize objective laws to deal with the problems we face and do our work well; at the same time, with this knowledge, we can also help us to summarize work experience, so as to raise the perceptual knowledge in work to rational knowledge, and in turn guide our practice and overcome blindness in work.
    If you don't study hard or study theory seriously, you will make subjectivist mistakes. All mistakes have epistemological roots and violate materialism and dialectics. Of course, some mistakes are not only a matter of understanding, but also a matter of position, but the wrong position must also be expressed through wrong views and methods; in addition, to transform the position, we must also start with specific views and methods. The anti-Rightist struggle has given us a profound lesson: we must be good at analyzing the situation, we must maintain a keen political sense of smell, and we must observe reality from the height of Marxist principles, so that we will not be at a loss in the face of the rampant attacks of Rightist opportunism, or be deceived by the false appearances of Rightist opportunists. Rightist opportunists only look at the phenomenon, not the essence, and regard one finger as ten fingers, cannot see the great future of new things, and cling to their own narrow old experience, etc., which, apart from showing that their position is fundamentally wrong, also shows the subjectivity and one-sidedness of their thinking methods. Studying theory seriously and constantly transforming one's thinking is one of the necessary conditions for avoiding making big mistakes. It often happens that when we encounter a problem in our work and do not know how to deal with it in order to better conform to the Party's policies and conform to the interests of the country and the people, we think hard day and night and cannot find a good solution. But at this time, if you sit down quietly, find some relevant reference documents, read a few pages carefully, and think about the problem you are facing in light of the documents, you will get a lot of inspiration and find the key or way to solve the problem. At this time, it seems as if you have suddenly woken up and suddenly felt enlightened, and you immediately feel mentally happy and in a good mood. It also often happens that when we need to organize a material to explain a problem in our work, or when we need to theoretically criticize a wrong idea in a debate, in order to make the argument more sufficient and logical, we often need to refer to some documents and theoretical books; but when we open the book, we often cannot find where the sentences that explain our argument and the principles that enrich and demonstrate our argument are, and we also feel anxious and puzzled in our minds. Sometimes I see others quoting some insightful sentences from classic works in their articles, and I also envy them, "I regret that I have not read enough when I need to use books," which shows that reading and work are unified on the basis of practice, and there is no contradiction.
    Of course, reading must be subordinate to the needs of work. If you put aside your work and read for the sake of reading, that is naturally wrong. It is also wrong for some people to read not from the needs of work, but only from personal interests. Reading is not to decorate oneself, not to recite some revolutionary words and principles, let alone to learn some dogmas to scare "country bumpkins," but to do a good job and to apply them. If you have read a lot of books and have correct theories, but you just talk about them for a while, put them on the shelf, and do not implement them, then reading any more is meaningless.
    The actual situation is often like this: when we read some books, know some theories, and learn some revolutionary principles, but these theories and principles have not been confirmed by our own practice or have not been carefully observed in objective reality, our understanding of these theories and principles only stays at the stage of abstract concepts, and we cannot have a deeper and more concrete understanding of its actual content. For example, when we first learned the sentence "specifically analyze specific situations," we only felt that this sentence was good and very important, but we did not understand how to analyze it specifically. Only when we have done some investigation and research, made some comparisons of some things, and found the commonalities and differences in various situations, will our understanding of this sentence be more concrete.
    "The foundation of theory is practice, and it in turn serves practice." Therefore, reading must be combined with reality and one's own work. Our leader Chairman Mao and our Party strongly oppose the dogmatic reading method, which is the reason.

    读书与工作
    张浩然
    常常听到这样的说法：“工作太忙，实在没有时间看书。”或者“某某同志只顾看书不顾工作”。这反映了读书和工作之间的矛盾。
    读书和工作是有矛盾的，因为它是不同的两件事。但是它又是统一的，因为读书是为了提高政治理论水平和思想水平，增加业务技术知识。归根到底，还是为了做好工作。因此，两者是既矛盾又统一，是“相反相成”的。
    当然，读书需要时间，读书和工作的矛盾，往往从时间上表现出来。工作繁忙，任务紧急，需要处理的实际问题多的时候，就往往容易把读书的时间挤掉。从现象看，这里时间是矛盾的焦点，合理地调整读书和工作的时间，就成为解决矛盾的主要一环。但是问题的实质并不在这里，问题的实质在于正确地认识读书和工作的统一性。一个人的工作越忙，需要处理的事务和问题越多，就需要有更高的思想水平，更远大而开朗的眼界，这只靠苦思是不行的，必须借助读书，提高认识能力。为了有正确的思想方法和工作方法，以便在复杂的现象中，辨明前进的方向，找到矛盾的本质和解决矛盾的方法，就需要读一些哲学的书；为了掌握和利用客观经济规律，做好经济工作，使经济工作越做越细，就需要读政治经济学的书；为了掌握一个部门工作的知识和规律，做好一个部门的工作，还需要仔细研究党的政策方针，阅读重要文件和一些有关的业务技术知识的书；等等。
    毛主席在“实践论”中说道：“一切真知都是从直接经验发源的。但人不能事事直接经验，事实上多数的知识都是间接经验的东西，这就是一切古代的和外域的知识”。古代的和外域的知识从哪里来呢？只有靠读书。一个人接触的面是有限的，只凭个人的一点经验是不够的，何况旧的经验并不能完全用来解决新的问题。社会主义建设是一个复杂的整体，每一个人的工作和别人的工作，每一个部门的工作和别个部门的工作，都有密切的联系。例如要作好社会产品的分配工作，就必须了解生产和消费的情况；要搞好生产，也必须了解分配和消费者的要求，生产某种产品，也必须了解这种产品在社会主义建设中的地位和作用；消费也必须适应生产和分配情况。因此，只了解自己的工作，只了解本部门的工作，不了解别人的工作、别部门的工作，只看到局部不看整体，就很难把自己的工作做好。读书不只是增长我们的知识，扩大我们的眼界，而且能帮助我们总结经验，能使我们了解客观事物的规律。在经济生活中，有各种各样的经济规律在客观地发生着作用。比如在社会主义社会，有社会主义的基本经济规律，有计划按比例发展规律，商品和价值规律，按劳分配规律等等，都是不以人们的意志为转移的。一个作经济工作的人，如果对这些规律的作用毫无所知，就不但不能适应这些规律和利用这些规律做好工作，而且会在工作中犯错误；相反地，如果有了这些知识，就可以帮助我们正确地认识客观事物，找出事物矛盾的主要环节，并掌握和利用客观规律处理好自己所面临的问题，做好工作；同时，有了这些知识，还可以帮助我们总结工作经验，从而把工作中的感性认识提高到理性认识，转过来指导我们的实践，克服工作中的盲目性。
    不好好读书，不认真学习理论，就要犯主观主义的错误。所有的错误都有认识论的根源，都是违反了唯物论和辩证法。当然有的错误不仅是认识问题，而且是立场问题，但是错误的立场也一定是通过错误的观点和方法表现出来；此外，要改造立场，也要从具体的观点方法入手。反右倾斗争，就给我们一个深刻的教训：必须善于分析形势，必须保持灵敏的政治嗅觉，必须从马克思主义的原则高度来观察现实，这样才不致在右倾机会主义的猖狂进攻下茫然失措，或者为右倾机会主义者的假象所迷惑。右倾机会主义者只看现象，不看本质，把一个指头当成十个指头，看不见新生事物的远大前途，死抱住个人的狭小的旧经验不放，等等，这除开表明他们的立场根本错误以外，也表明他们的思想方法的主观性和片面性。认真学习理论，不断改造思想，是避免犯大错误的必要条件之一。经常有这样的事情，当在工作中遇到一个问题，不知如何处理才能更符合党的政策，符合国家和人民的利益的时候，日夜苦思，找不到良策。但是在这个时候，静坐下来，找一些有关的参考文件，认真地读几页书，对照文件想想自己面临的问题，就会得到很大启发，找到处理问题的钥匙或途径，这时，好像恍然大悟，顿开茅塞，立时感到精神愉快，心情舒畅。也常常有这样的事情，当在工作中，需要整理一个材料说明一个问题的时候，或者在辩论会上，需要对一种错误思想从理论上加以批驳的时候，为了把道理说得更充分一些，更符合逻辑一些，往往需要参考一些文件和理论书籍；但是当翻开书本的时候，对于说明自己论点的句子，对于充实和论证自己论点的原理，往往找不到在什么地方，这时思想上也感到焦急，纳闷。有时看到别人在文章中引用了一些经典著作中的精辟句子，自己也很羡慕，“书到用时方恨少”，这说明，读书和工作在实践的基础上统一起来了，并没有矛盾。
    当然，读书是要服从工作需要的。如果放着工作不做，为读书而读书，那自然是不对的。有的人读书不是从工作需要出发，只从个人兴趣出发，那也是不对的。读书不是为了装璜自己，不是为了背诵一些革命的词句和原理，更不是为了学习一些教条去吓唬“土包子”，而是为了做好工作，为了应用。如果读了很多书，有了正确的理论，只是把它空谈一阵，束之高阁，并不实行，那末，读书再多也是没有意义的。
    实际的情况往往是这样，当我们读了一些书，知道了一些理论，学了一些革命原理，但是这些理论原理还没有经过自己亲身在实践中证实或者没有对客观实际生活作过认真地观察的时候，我们对这些理论原理的了解就仅仅停留在抽象概念的阶段，对它的实际内容不能有更深刻更具体的理解。比如“具体地分析具体情况”这句话，当我们初学时，只是感到这句话好，很重要，但是究竟怎样具体分析，就不怎么理解了。当我们作过一些调查研究，对一些事物作了一些比较，发现了各种情况的共同点和不同点，对这句话的理解才更具体。
    “理论的基础是实践，又转过来为实践服务”。因此，读书必须联系实际，联系自己的工作。我们的领袖毛主席和我们党极力反对教条主义的读书方法，就是这个道理。
