    Increased Rosin Production to Meet Construction Needs
    Winter Resin Production Unfolds in Various Regions
    (Our Newspaper News) A vigorous winter pine resin harvesting and production campaign is currently underway in all major resin-producing regions of the country. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Forestry, the national average daily resin production in early November has basically maintained the average daily production level of October. Guangdong Province, which has the largest production task, saw an increase in the average daily rosin production in the first half of November compared to October.
    In the past, China only harvested pine resin during the two hundred-plus days from "Qingming" to "Frost's Descent." Although individual regions had previously conducted winter resin harvesting, it was not widely implemented due to the belief that winter harvesting resulted in low yields and negatively impacted tree growth, making it economically unviable. This year, in order to ensure the completion of rosin and turpentine production tasks and meet the growing needs of the national economy for rosin, various regions, after opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, broke away from past conventions. Under the leadership of party committees at all levels, they launched a mass winter pine resin harvesting and production campaign. In Guangdong Province, secretaries of the provincial party committee to the prefectural and commune party committees, as well as some production team party branch secretaries, took personal command, strengthening leadership over resin production and quickly sparking a winter resin harvesting upsurge. Emerging, Huaiji, Zijin, Lechang, Luoding, and other counties in the province organized more than 10,000 people to go up the mountains. Every people's commune in Zijin County established a mountain command post to specifically resolve issues in resin production, greatly promoting production. By early November, fifteen people's communes in Guangdong Province had successively overfulfilled their annual pine resin production plans ahead of schedule. Major pine resin-producing regions such as Guangxi, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Sichuan have also launched winter resin harvesting campaigns to compete with the weather.
    During winter resin production, various regions widely carried out competition movements to learn from, catch up with, surpass, and help the backward, vigorously promoting technological innovation and advanced experiences such as chemical resin harvesting. Since Longquan County in Zhejiang Province overfulfilled its annual pine resin production task and resolved to propose a competition to all brother counties in the province with the condition of increasing production by another two thousand dan of pine resin, a competition upsurge of "learning from Longquan, catching up with Longquan, and surpassing Longquan" has been launched throughout the province. Members of people's communes in Changhua County, while overfulfilling the county's annual production task on November 2, resolved to produce another two hundred dan of pine resin in November. Professional resin harvesting workers at the Dankou Forestry Station of the Chengbu County Forestry Bureau in Hunan put forward the slogan "Learn from Lianyuan, surpass Dongkou, catch up with Xinning, compete with Suining, strive for first place in the province, and make winter resin harvesting catch up with the peak season," launching a vigorous red flag competition movement. The professional workers here also successfully experimented with methods of using local medicines, caustic soda, and salt water for resin harvesting, increasing the yield per plant by about one time. They also widely promoted sulfuric acid chemical resin harvesting in forest areas that will be harvested within two years. Since the temperature dropped in late October, the average daily production here has increased by 57.6% compared to June to September, and the yield per plant has increased by about seven times. In the competition, many regions promptly conducted summaries, evaluations, stipulated various methods for rewards, and organized advanced experience promotion groups and on-site visits to widely impart winter resin harvesting techniques and promote various advanced experiences. In addition to widely promoting kerosene resin harvesting and salt water resin harvesting experiences, Shantou Prefecture in Guangdong experimented with using urine and bleaching powder as stimulants for resin harvesting. According to their experiments, using urine for resin harvesting is more than twice as efficient as using salt water.
    Various regions also relied on the masses to find ways to open up sources of pine resin. In Heilongjiang Province, in the north of the motherland, winter resin harvesting cannot be carried out due to climatic conditions. In response to this situation, employees of the Dafeng and Langxiang Forestry Bureaus in the province created the experience of extracting pine resin by "boiling pine knots and pine roots in water," opening up new avenues for fully utilizing resources and producing rosin year-round. Since mid-October, the Yichun Forest Area has launched a vigorous new upsurge in pine resin production. Workers, cadres, and family members in the forest area have actively participated in this production movement. Silviculture and logging workers used the method of carrying back items while going down the mountains. From October 15 to 25, they collected 5,830 tons of pine knots and produced 47 tons of pine resin and 14 tons of rosin. (Attached picture)

### 多产松香满足建设需要  冬季松脂生产在各产区展开

    多产松香满足建设需要
    冬季松脂生产在各产区展开
    本报讯　一个蓬蓬勃勃的冬季采割松脂生产运动，目前正在全国各主要松脂产区开展起来。据林业部的不完全统计，11月上旬全国松脂平均日产量基本保持了10月份的平均日产水平。生产任务最大的广东省，11月上半月的松香平均日产量比10月份还有所增长。
    我国各地向来只在“清明”到“霜降”的二百多天里采割松脂，过去虽然也有个别地区进行过冬季采脂，但是由于认为冬季采脂产量低，影响树木生长，在经济上不合算，因此没有普遍开展。今年为了保证完成松香、松节油生产任务，满足国民经济对松香日益增长的需要，各地经过反右倾、鼓干劲，打破了历年来的常规，在各级党委的领导下，开展了群众性的冬季采割松脂生产运动。广东省从省委书记到地委、公社党委以及部分生产队党支部书记层层挂帅，加强了对松脂生产的领导，很快掀起冬季采脂高潮。这个省新兴、怀集、紫金、乐昌、罗定等县组织了一万多人上山。紫金县每个人民公社都成立了山头指挥部，具体解决采脂生产中的问题，大大推动了生产。到11月初旬，广东全省已有十五个人民公社先后提前超额完成了全年松脂生产计划。广西、福建、湖南、江西、四川等主要松脂产区，也都开展了与天争时的冬季采脂运动。
    在冬季采脂生产中，各地广泛地开展了学先进、赶先进、超先进、帮落后的竞赛运动，大闹技术革新，大力推广化学采脂等先进经验。浙江省自从龙泉县超额完成全年松脂生产任务、决心以再增产二千担松脂的条件，向全省各兄弟县提出竞赛以后，全省各地掀起了“学龙泉、赶龙泉、超龙泉”的竞赛热潮。昌化县各人民公社社员，在11月2日超额完成了全县的全年生产任务的同时，决心在11月份，再生产松脂二百担。湖南城步县林业局丹口林业站采脂专业工人提出了“学涟源、超洞口、赶新宁、赛绥宁，争取全省第一，冬季采脂赶上旺季”的口号，开展了轰轰烈烈的红旗竞赛运动。这里的专业工人并且试验成功了用土药、烧碱、盐水等采脂的方法，使单株产量提高一倍左右。他们还在两年内就要采伐的林区普遍推行了硫酸剂化学采脂。自10月下旬气温下降以来，这里的平均日产量比6月至9月份提高了57.6％，单株产量提高七倍左右。在竞赛中许多地区及时进行了总结、评比，规定各种办法进行奖励，组织了先进经验推广团、现场参观等方法，广泛传授了冬季采脂技术，推广了各种先进经验。广东汕头专区除了广泛推广了煤油采脂、盐水采脂经验外，还试验用尿水、漂白粉作为刺激剂进行采脂。据他们试验，用尿水采脂比盐水采脂的效率提高一倍以上。
    各地还依靠群众，千方百计地开辟松脂来源。在祖国北方的黑龙江省，由于受气候条件的限制，冬季不能进行采脂。这个省的大丰、朗乡等林业局职工针对这一情况创造了“水煮明子、松根”提取松脂的经验，为充分利用资源、常年生产松香开辟了新的途径。伊春林区从10月中旬开始开展了一个声势浩大的松脂生产新高潮。林区的工人、干部、家属妇女都积极投入这个生产运动，营林、采伐工人利用下山捎带的办法，从10月15日到25日的十天中，就采集了五千八百三十吨松明子，生产松脂四十七吨、松香十四吨。（附图片）
