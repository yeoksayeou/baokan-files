The Jiang Mifeng People's Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yongji County, Jilin Province, under the leadership of the Commune Party Committee, has achieved great success in recent years due to its conscientious implementation of the policy of serving production and consumption, and has consistently been an advanced unit in the province's commercial system.

On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, this Supply and Marketing Cooperative achieved even greater development in 1959. In particular, it has made even more significant achievements in promoting the diversified operations of the People's Commune. From January to August this year, the number of pigs in the Jiang Mifeng People's Commune increased from 3,000 to 6,200, poultry increased from 2,700 to more than 62,000, bees increased from 250 hives to 463 hives, 600,000 fish were raised, and 100,000 fruit trees were planted, etc. By the end of August, the total income from diversified operations in the commune reached 790,000 yuan, averaging 182 yuan per household.

Due to the rapid development of diversified operations, commodity production has expanded. In the first eight months of this year, the commodity rate of diversified operation products in the commune reached 55.8%, an increase of 20.7% over the same period last year; the number of sideline products increased from 186 last year to 238; and the purchase amount of local and sideline products was 550,000 yuan, an increase of 153.2% over the same period last year. At the same time, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also focused on helping the four relatively poor management areas to develop production and change their appearance. Therefore, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative has been praised by the Party Committee and the commune members.

　　Participate in planning, sign contracts

The Supply and Marketing Cooperative started with surveying resources and actively participated in the formulation of diversified operation plans by the commune, management area, and production team. They helped the commune formulate the 1959 diversified operation development plan by calculating the four accounts of resources, labor, time, and potential. The total value of purchase and sales contracts signed throughout the year reached 1,142,000 yuan.

In the process of signing contracts, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative helped to uniformly arrange labor, with 10% to 15% of the labor force participating in sideline production; it also helped the commune establish diversified operation production bases with pigs, poultry, and vegetables as the mainstays; at the same time, it formed ten specialized production teams, ninety-four seasonal production groups, and established three weaving factories and seven collective diversified operation farms. While developing collective operations, it also organized commune members to engage in individual sideline production, stipulating reasonable remuneration and bonus systems, which stimulated the production enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members.

　　Supply seeds, guide technology

After the Supply and Marketing Cooperative implemented the contract system with the commune, management area, and production team, the Party organizations at all levels knew what was going on, and the commune members' enthusiasm increased, and diversified operations developed unprecedentedly. This brought a series of new requirements to the commercial departments: supplying seedlings, feed, and tools, and also requiring help in solving some breeding technology problems. Through business activities, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative successively supplied the commune with a large number of chicks, breeding pigs, fish fry, sweet potato seedlings, potato seeds, various vegetable seeds, feed seeds, ginseng seeds, and other seedlings, meeting the needs of production.

In order to prevent pig diseases, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative promptly supplied pig stomachic tablets and other medicines, preventing the occurrence of diseases. At the same time, it also helped the management areas train 110 technicians, cultivated 12 incubators for various hatcheries, and hired two specialized technicians from other places to guide the raising of Beijing ducks.

　　Improve procurement methods

When the raw materials of wild plants matured, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized 45 employees, adopted the method of assigning areas of responsibility and sending key personnel to stay in, penetrating deep into mountainous areas and grasslands to organize production and strengthen collection guidance. At the same time, it adjusted the commercial purchase network, established 13 fixed points, 40 mobile purchase and agency points, basically achieving that there were purchase points in the management area and purchase personnel in the team, carrying out purchase under the lamp, purchase in the field, purchase in the mountains, and purchase in the morning and evening, which facilitated the masses and stimulated the production enthusiasm of the masses. According to statistics from August 25 to 30, the wild pears, wild crabapples, and other wild plants collected were worth more than 55,000 yuan.

　　Rely closely on the leadership of the Party Committee

The experience of the Jiang Mifeng People's Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative in achieving the above-mentioned results is: relying closely on the leadership of the Party Committee, constantly asking the Party Committee for instructions and reporting work, acting in accordance with the instructions of the Party Committee, and conducting all business activities around the central work of the Party. The Party Committee also carries out unified deployment and unified inspection of commercial work, so that the direction of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative is clear. In its work, it adheres to putting politics in command, strengthens the ideological education of employees, constantly opposes right-leaning slackness, and strives to clarify what is unclear and learn what is not known, learning while doing, thereby encouraging the enthusiasm of employees.

    江密峰人民公社供销部多方促进多种经营发展
    商品生产扩大　公社收入增加
    本报讯　吉林省永吉县江密峰人民公社供销部在公社党委的领导下，由于认真地贯彻执行了为生产为消费服务的方针，几年来取得了很大的成绩，一直是全省商业系统的先进单位。
    这个供销部在1958年大跃进的基础上，1959年的工作又获得了很大发展。特别是在促进人民公社发展多种经营方面，成绩更为显著。今年1至8月份，江密峰人民公社的生猪由三千头发展到六千二百头，家禽由二千七百只发展到六万二千多只，蜜蜂由二百五十箱发展到四百六十三箱，养鱼六十万尾，种果树十万棵，等等。到8月末，全公社多种经营收入七十九万元，平均每户达到一百八十二元。
    由于多种经营的迅速发展，扩大了商品生产。今年八个月公社多种经营产品中商品率达到55.8％，比去年同期提高20.7％；副业品种由去年的一百八十六种增加到二百三十八种；土副产品收购额为五十五万元，比去年同期提高了153.2％。与此同时，供销部还重点地帮助了较贫困的四个管理区发展了生产，改变了面貌。因此，供销部受到党委和社员的表扬。
  参与规划，签订合同
    供销部从勘察资源入手，积极参与公社、管理区、生产队制定多种经营规划。他们通过算资源、劳动力、时间、潜力四笔账的方法，帮助公社制定了1959年多种经营发展规划。全年签订的合同购销总额达一百一十四万二千元。
    在签订合同过程中，供销部帮助统一安排了劳动力，以10％至15％的劳动力参加副业生产；还帮助公社以猪、禽、菜为纲，建立了多种经营生产基地；同时，组成了十个专业生产队，九十四个季节性生产组，建立起三个编织工厂，七个集体多种经营场。在发展集体经营的同时，还组织社员个人进行副业生产，规定了合理报酬和超额奖励制度，激发起广大社员的生产积极性。
    供应种籽，指导技术
    供销部和公社、管理区、生产队实行合同制度以后，各级党组织心中有数，社员干劲倍增，多种经营空前发展，随之而来的是给商业部门提出的一系列的新要求：供应苗种、饲料、工具，还要求帮助解决一些养种技术上的问题。供销部通过业务活动，先后供应了公社大批鸡雏、种猪、鱼种、地瓜秧、土豆籽、各种蔬菜种籽、饲料种籽、人参籽以及其他种苗，满足了生产的需要。
    为了防止猪病，供销部及时供应了猪健胃片等药品，防止了疾病的发生。与此同时，还帮助各管理区培训了一百一十名技术人员，为各孵化场培养了十二名孵化员，又由外地聘请来两名专门技术人员，指导饲养北京鸭。
    改进收购方法
    在野生植物原料成熟的时候，供销部组织了四十五名职工，采取分片包干，重点派员驻在的方法，深入山区草原，组织生产，加强采集指导。同时调整了商业收购网点，建立十三个固定点，四十个流动收购和代购点，基本上达到管理区有收购点，队有收购人员，开展了灯下收购，地头收购，上山收购，早晚收购，方便了群众，激发了群众的生产积极性。仅据8月25日到30日五天的统计，采下的山梨、山丁子，以及其他野生植物共值五万五千多元。
    紧紧依靠党委领导
    江密峰人民公社供销部取得上述成绩的经验是：紧紧依靠党委领导，经常向党委请示汇报工作，按着党委的指示办事，一切业务活动都围绕党的中心工作进行。党委对商业工作也进行统一布置，统一检查，使供销部工作方向明确。在工作中坚持了政治挂帅，加强对职工的思想教育工作，经常反对右倾松劲情绪，做到不明就辩，不会就学，边学边干，从而鼓舞了职工的干劲。
