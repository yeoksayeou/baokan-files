Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 6th, Reporter Zhang Jiachi reports: Shanghai's industrial front achieved comprehensive leap forward results in October. The seven industrial bureaus of metallurgy, machinery, electrical machinery, textiles, chemicals, and light industry all overfulfilled their monthly plans. The city's total industrial output value in October exceeded September, the highest since this year, by 6.8%, with a daily output value increase of 11.5%. The quantity and quality of most of the forty major products surpassed September. Among them, steel increased by 23% and steel products increased by 29%.

Shanghai's industrial front achieved comprehensive leap forward results in October. The seven industrial bureaus of metallurgy, machinery, electrical machinery, textiles, chemicals, and light industry all overfulfilled their plans. Although the actual working days this month were two to three days less than in September, the city's total industrial output value still exceeded September, the highest since this year, by 6.8%; calculated by actual working days, the average daily output value in October increased by 11.5% compared to September, creating a new production level.

In October, the output and quality of most of the city's forty major industrial products improved compared to September, and raw material consumption was further reduced; among them, the output of products such as steel, steel products, pig iron, and coke increased particularly rapidly, with steel production increasing by 23% and steel products increasing by 29% compared to the previous month. The qualification rate of steel generally increased, with open-hearth steel reaching 99.08% and converter steel reaching 96.24%. The iron consumption per ton of steel in October also generally decreased. The three converter workshops of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 reduced iron consumption by 61 kg to 221 kg respectively, and the entire plant saved 8,000 tons of pig iron in October. In the textile industry, under conditions of relatively tight electricity consumption in October, cotton yarn production increased by 11.6%, cotton cloth increased by 7.5%, the first-grade and first-class product rate of cotton yarn rose to 99.86%, and the amount of cotton used per piece of yarn decreased by 1.3 kg. The scrap rate of cast steel parts and cast iron parts in the electromechanical industry also decreased compared to September.

Due to the continuous comprehensive leap forward in October, Shanghai's industrial production situation is getting better and better. The early completion of the state plan for annual steel production and the state plan for annual total industrial output value is now within sight.

The tremendous victory of Shanghai's industrial production in October is the result of continuing to thoroughly oppose right-leaning ideas, boosting morale, and continuing to carry out mass movements on a large scale. After achieving a "red banner across the board" in September, many factories continued their efforts, prepared for October's production in advance, and achieved a "red opening" on National Day, with production steadily increasing. However, some factory cadres developed new right-leaning and lax sentiments. In order to strive for greater victory in October, the municipal party committee promptly put forward the slogan "October surpasses September, strive for a red banner across the board," requiring the district committees and industrial systems to continue to implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, thoroughly oppose right-leaning ideas, boost morale, and carry out mass movements on a larger scale. According to the instructions of the municipal party committee, factories and enterprises throughout the city mobilized the masses to re-discuss and revise plans. Some cadres of the Jiangning Motor Factory originally thought that it was impossible for October to surpass September. They put forward four reasons: fewer working days in October; fifty-one training periods expiring and returning, reducing labor; a large number of new products being launched, which would reduce production; and the fact that September had already set a historical record, making it difficult to improve further. Under the leadership of the party organization, the masses were mobilized to launch debates and calculations, refuting this right-leaning conservative argument; by the end of the month, the entire factory not only overfulfilled the production plan, but the output value also increased by 17.2% compared to September.

The city's workers and masses responded to the call of the Central Committee and the Municipal Party Committee to complete the annual state plan ahead of schedule, and formulated "small advance" plans at all levels, which is an important feature of the in-depth development of the increase production and practice economy movement in October. Because factories, workshops, groups, and individuals all formulated "small advance" plans at all levels, everyone had specific goals for increasing production and practicing economy, and the socialist labor emulation and technical innovation movement was carried out more extensively. The convening of the city and national hero meetings further promoted the progress of the movement, set off a mass movement with the powerful momentum of "catching up with the advanced and helping the backward," and created many effective new forms. For example, the "double competition" between skilled workers and novices carried out by the Chengfu Iron Factory, the "cooperation competition" between advanced classes and backward classes implemented by the North Weaving Workshop of State Cotton Mill No. 1, etc., have achieved great results in helping unskilled workers improve their operational skills. Some factories implemented the method of simultaneous performance by skilled workers and slow workers, summarizing experience on the spot, which immediately increased the production efficiency of unskilled workers by 20% to 30%.

During the upsurge of the mass movement in October, all districts, industries, factories, workshops, groups, and individuals in the city comprehensively cooperated in all aspects from production cooperation to raw materials, equipment, labor, technology, and management. Many districts have organized all factories into cooperation groups by industry, and some districts also hold regular cooperation meetings, soliciting cooperation objects in the form of big-character posters. Some districts use the "consultation" method to jointly help a factory solve key problems in enterprise management or production technology, so that the management level and technical level of backward factories can be quickly improved. Comprehensive cooperation not only solves production problems, but also greatly promotes the communist style and becomes a driving force of thought. "Give convenience to others and leave difficulties to ourselves" has become a mass slogan.

In October, due to the vigorous development of the mass movement, a situation of "model soldiers in sets, competitions networked, and red flags forming a forest" has emerged, and the ranks of advanced teams and skilled workers have been unprecedentedly expanded. The steel industry has universally improved the production level of converter workshops throughout the city through a vigorous record-breaking competition and performance competition. Six of the ten converter workshops in the steel plants under the Shanghai Metallurgical Bureau system rank among the top in the country in terms of utilization coefficient. The city's young workers launched a high-speed movement to stride into 1960, and by the end of October, 22,668 young workers and 546 youth collectives had advanced into 1960 ahead of schedule. The city's textile workers responded to the initiative of 300 skilled workers and strived to improve their operational skills. At present, 80% of the loom operators and 70% of the weavers have reached the standard of skilled workers.

Shanghai's industrial system is currently continuing to oppose right-leaning ideas, boost morale, further improve enterprise management, and carry out technical innovations on a large scale, doing everything possible to eliminate the phenomenon of being slack at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month, striving to ensure that the production level in early November is not lower than that in late October, and that the total industrial output value in November will surpass that in October, and complete and overfulfill the annual state plan as well as possible, and prepare for continued leap forward next year.

    上海工业生产十月超九月
    冶金、机械、电机、纺织、化工、轻工业超额完成月计划
    全年钢产量和工业总产值计划的提前完成已胜利在握
    全市十月份工业总产值超过今年以来最高的九月份百分之六点八，日产值增长百分之十一点五。四十种主要产品的量和质大部赛过九月份。其中钢增长百分之二十三，钢材增长百分之二十九。
    据新华社上海6日电　记者张家炽报道：上海市工业战线10月份取得全面跃进成果。冶金、机械、电机、纺织、化工、轻工业等七个工业局都超额完成计划。这个月实际工作日虽然比9月份少两天到三天，但是全市工业总产值仍然超过今年以来最高的9月份6.8％；按实际工作日计算，10月份平均日产值比9月份增长11.5％，创造了新的生产水平。
    10月份，全市四十种主要工业产品的产量和质量，大部分比9月份提高，原材料消耗进一步降低；其中，钢、钢材、生铁、焦炭等产品的产量上升得特别快，钢产量比上月增长23％，钢材增长29％。钢的合格率普遍提高，平炉钢达到99.08％，转炉钢达到96.24％。10月份每吨钢的铁耗，也普遍降低，上钢一厂三个转炉车间铁耗分别降低六十一公斤到二百二十一公斤，全厂10月份节约生铁达八千吨。纺织工业10月份在用电比较紧张的条件下，棉纱产量又增长11.6％，棉布增长7.5％，棉纱的一等一级品率上升到99.86％，每件纱的用棉量又降低一点三公斤。机电工业的铸钢件，铸铁件，废品率也比9月下降。
    由于10月份继续全面跃进，上海工业生产形势愈来愈好，提前完成全年钢产量国家计划和全年工业总产值国家计划，已胜利在望。
    上海市工业生产10月份获得巨大胜利，是继续深入反右倾、鼓干劲，继续大搞群众运动的结果。上海工业部门在9月份获得“满堂红”的巨大胜利之后，许多工厂再接再厉，提前做好10月份的生产准备工作，做到国庆节“开门红”，生产步步高。但是，部分工厂干部中出现了新的右倾松劲情绪。为了在10月份争取更大的胜利，市委及时提出“10月超9月，争取满堂红”的口号，要求各区委及各工业系统继续贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，深入反透右倾，鼓足干劲，更大规模地开展群众运动。根据市委指示，全市各工厂企业纷纷发动群众重新讨论修订计划。江宁电机厂有的干部原来认为10月超9月是不可能的。他们提出四个理由：10月份工作日少；有五十一个培训工期满回去，劳动力减少；大量新产品上马，生产会下降；9月份已创历史最高纪录，再提高有困难。在党组织领导下，发动群众展开辩论、算账，驳倒了这种右倾保守论点；到月底全厂不仅超额完成生产计划，产值比9月份还提高17.2％。　　全市职工群众响应中央和市委提前完成全年国家计划的号召，层层制订“小提前”规划，是10月份增产节约运动深入发展的重要特点。由于工厂、车间、小组、个人，层层制订“小提前”规划，人人有了具体的增产节约的奋斗目标，社会主义劳动竞赛和技术革新运动就更加广泛地开展起来。全市和全国群英会的召开，又进一步促进了运动前进，掀起了“赶先进、帮落后”声势浩大的群众运动，并且创造了许多行之有效的新的形式。例如诚孚铁工厂开展的能手和新手的“双打竞赛”，国棉一厂北织车间先进班派能手到落后班去实行班与班的“协作竞赛”等等，对于帮助不熟练的工人提高操作水平都取得很大效果。有的厂实行能手与慢手同时表演、当场总结经验的办法，使操作不熟练的工人立即提高生产效率20％到30％。
    在10月份群众运动高潮中，全市各区各行业、工厂、车间、小组、个人之间，从生产协作发展到原料材料、设备、劳动力、技术、管理等各方面全面协作。许多区已把所有工厂按行业组成协作小组，有的区还定期召开协作会议，用大字报方式征求协作对象，有的区采用“会诊”办法，共同帮助一个厂解决企业管理或生产技术上的关键，使落后厂的管理水平和技术水平很快提高。全面协作不仅解决生产问题，也使共产主义风格大大发扬，成为一种思想动力。“把方便送给别人，把困难留给自己”，已成为群众性的口号。
    10月份由于群众运动的蓬勃发展，出现了“标兵成套，竞赛成网，红旗成林”的局面，先进队伍和能手队伍空前壮大。钢铁工业通过轰轰烈烈的创纪录竞赛和表演赛。使全市转炉车间生产水平普遍提高。市冶金局系统各钢铁厂十个转炉车间有六个车间的利用系数在全国名列前茅。全市青年工人展开高速度跨进1960年运动，到10月底已有二万二千六百六十八名青工和五百四十六个青年集体提前跨进1960年。全市纺织工人响应三百能手倡议，努力提高操作水平，目前已有80％的挡车工和70％的织布工达到能手标准。
    上海工业系统目前正继续反右倾、鼓干劲，进一步改进企业管理和大搞技术革新，千方百计消灭月初松月底紧的现象，力争11月上旬生产水平不低于10月下旬，11月份工业总产值再超过10月份，尽可能更好、更全面地提前超额完成全年国家计划，并且为明年继续跃进作好准备。
