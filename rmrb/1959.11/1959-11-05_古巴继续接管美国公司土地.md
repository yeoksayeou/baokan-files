    Cuba Continues to Take Over Land from American Companies
    (Havana dispatch) The Cuban government, in accordance with the land reform law, is continuing to take over land from American companies.

    It is reported that on November 3rd, the Cuban Land Reform Committee took over the Indio Ranch in Camagüey Province, operated by an American, which owns 21,000 acres of land. This ranch raises 12,000 head of cattle and belongs to the American-owned Francisco Sugar Company.

    In addition, the Cuban Land Reform Committee recently took over nearly 75,000 acres of land operated by Americans in Oriente Province, including nearly 10,000 acres of land belonging to mining areas leased to the American Bethlehem Steel Company. This action strengthened the Cuban government's control over American-managed farmland and mining areas in this region. At the same time, the Cuban Land Reform Committee also took over more than 30,000 acres of land from an American-funded oil exploration company and 35,000 acres of land controlled by a subsidiary of Phillips Petroleum Company.

    Major Luis Borges, representative of the National Land Reform Committee in Las Villas Province, said to "Hoy" newspaper: The land reform in this province is being stepped up. Recently, thirteen farms with about 2,500 caballerias have been taken over. The National Land Reform Committee has allocated more than 66,682,400 pesos to purchase more than 8,000 head of livestock for these farms.

    Borges also mentioned that in order to abolish the exploitation of peasants by middlemen, people's stores have been widely established in areas where land reform is being implemented.

    本报讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴政府根据土地改革法，继续接管美国公司的土地。
    据报道，古巴土地改革委员会11月3日接管了卡马圭省一家拥有二万一千英亩土地的美国人经营的因迪奥牧场。这家牧场饲养一万二千头牛，属于美商弗朗西斯科糖公司所有。
    此外，古巴土地改革委员会最近还在奥连特省接管了将近七万五千英亩美国人经营的土地，其中包括将近一万英亩属于租让给美国伯利恒钢铁公司的矿区的土地。这一行动加强了古巴政府对这一地区美国人管理的农田和矿区的控制。与此同时，古巴土地改革委员会还接管了一家美国出资的石油勘探公司的三万多英亩的土地和由菲利浦石油公司一家子公司所控制的三万五千英亩的土地。
    土地改革全国委员会拉斯维利亚斯省代表路易斯·博尔赫斯少校对“今日报”发表谈话说：这个省的土地改革在加紧进行。最近接管了约有二千五百卡瓦耶里亚的十三个农庄。土地改革全国委员会已经拨款六千六百八十二万四千多比索为这些农庄购买了八千多头牲畜。
    博尔赫斯还谈到：为了废除中间商人对农民的剥削，在实行土地改革的地区广泛地建立了人民商店。
