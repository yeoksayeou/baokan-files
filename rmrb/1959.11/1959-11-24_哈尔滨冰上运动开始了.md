Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 23rd: The silvery winter, with its unique charm, has arrived on the banks of the Songhua River. In Harbin, as dusk falls each day, groups of Harbin residents, carrying their ice skates, stream from factories, government offices, schools, and shops towards the ice rinks. The ice sports season, particularly beloved by Harbin people, has begun.

A month ago, the sports grounds where people were playing ball and racing are now mostly transformed into ice rinks. Children's skating activities started the earliest. After the first heavy snowfall, almost every ice-covered curb in the alleys saw children bringing out their sleds to run around, or playing ice hockey without any rules.

Workers who love sports insist on winter sports activities during days of continued leap-forward in production. The slogan proposed by the Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant is: "Win the red flag in production, achieve a great leap forward in sports." This year, the factory will have 5,000 people exercising on the ice rink. Starting December 10th, the city will launch a sixty-day ice skating friendship correspondence competition with the participation of 100,000 people. This competition includes collective mileage skating, individual speed skating, and individual figure skating. In collective mileage skating, each group of five, the men's group must skate a total of 450 kilometers in sixty days, and the women's group must skate 300 kilometers.

The city held a winter sports mobilization meeting on the 18th. Zheng Yiping, Secretary of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, proposed in his speech to turn Harbin into a veritable "city of ice sports." Representatives from various districts also put forward competitive conditions for carrying out winter sports. Daowai District will organize 170,000 people to participate in ice sports this winter.

    哈尔滨冰上运动开始了
    据新华社哈尔滨23日电　银色的冬天，带着它特有的魅力来到了松花江畔。在哈尔滨市，每天华灯初上，成群结队的哈尔滨人，背着冰鞋从工厂、机关、学校、商店向滑冰场涌去。哈尔滨人特别喜爱的冰上运动季节开始了。
    一个月前还有人在打球、赛跑的运动场所，现在大部分变成了滑冰场。孩子们的滑冰活动开始的最早。当第一场大雪落过，几乎在每一条胡同结了冰的路沿上，都能看到孩子们搬出了滑冰的橇板在奔跑，或是在打没有任何规则的冰球。
    工厂热爱运动的职工们，在生产继续跃进的日子里，坚持冬季体育活动。哈尔滨电机厂提出的口号是：生产夺红旗，体育大跃进。今年这个工厂将有五千人到冰场锻炼。12月10日起，全市将开展有十万人参加的为期六十天的滑冰友谊通讯赛。这项比赛包括集体里程滑冰、个人速度滑冰和个人花样滑冰。集体里程滑冰，每五人为一组，男子组要在六十天内总共滑完四百五十公里的长度，女子组要滑完三百公里。
    全市在18日举行了冬季体育誓师大会，中共哈尔滨市委书记郑依平在讲话中提出，要把哈尔滨市变成一个名副其实的“冰上运动之城”。各区代表也提出了开展冬季体育运动的竞赛条件。道外区将组织十七万人在今年冬季参加冰上运动。（附图片）
