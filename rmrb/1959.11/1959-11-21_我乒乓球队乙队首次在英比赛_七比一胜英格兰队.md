Xinhua News Agency, London, 19th: The Chinese Table Tennis Team B achieved a resounding victory over the English Table Tennis Team today in Slough, near London, with a score of 7-1.

This is the first time Chinese table tennis players have visited England. In the first match of the visit, 17-year-old Li Furong and 18-year-old Zhuang Zedong defeated the English first seed, Meare, and the fourth seed, Harrison, who participated in this year's World Table Tennis Championships, winning all four men's singles matches and one doubles match. They won each match by a score of 2-0.

Hu Keming, the 19-year-old Chinese women's singles champion, defeated Mortimer, who participated in this year's World Table Tennis Championships, by a score of 2-1, and together with Chi Huifang, defeated Mortimer and Bird in the women's doubles.

The only victory for the English team was Bird's 2-0 win over Chi Huifang in the women's singles.

The four male and female players from the English team were all experienced players who adopted the defensive tactics commonly used in Western countries. However, they seemed exhausted in the face of the young Chinese players' fierce offensive. All the Chinese players used varied serves, which put their opponents at a disadvantage from the start. The Chinese players seized every opportunity to attack, firmly maintaining the initiative.

The most exciting match was between Li Furong and Harrison. Harrison played steadily and defensively, cutting the ball low and with spin, often seizing the opportunity to counterattack with a backhand. However, Li Furong attacked quickly, accurately, and cleverly, pulling the opponent to both corners and combining it with short shots, causing Harrison to run back and forth and fall into a passive and failed position.

The table tennis match was held in Slough, more than thirty kilometers from London. All the admission tickets were sold out long before the Chinese team arrived.

Before the match, the Deputy Mayor of Slough delivered a welcome speech. Du Qian, the leader of the Chinese team and Vice Chairman of the Chinese Table Tennis Association, responded by saying that the visit of the Chinese table tennis team would help strengthen the friendship between Chinese and British table tennis players.

Huan Xiang, the Chargé d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, attended and watched the match.

The Chinese Table Tennis Team is visiting England at the invitation of the English Table Tennis Association. They will compete in six matches in various cities in England.

The detailed scores of each match today are as follows:

Men's Singles:
	Li Furong defeated Meare 21-8, 21-12.
	Zhuang Zedong defeated Harrison 21-13, 23-21.
	Zhuang Zedong defeated Meare 21-19, 21-10.
	Li Furong defeated Harrison 21-16, 21-14.

    我乒乓球队乙队首次在英比赛
    七比一胜英格兰队
    新华社伦敦19日电　中国乒乓球队乙队今天在伦敦附近的斯劳市以七比一的压倒优势，大胜英格兰乒乓球队。
    中国乒乓球运动员是第一次到英国访问。在访问的第一场比赛中，十七岁的李富荣和十八岁的庄则栋分别击败了英国第一号选手麦雷特和第四号选手、今年世界乒乓球锦标赛参加者哈里森，获得男子四盘单打和一盘双打的全部胜利。他们每一盘都以二比零获胜。
    中国女子单打冠军、十九岁的胡克明以二比一战胜了今年世界乒乓球锦标赛参加者摩蒂默，并且在女子双打中同池惠芳一起击败了摩蒂默和伯尔德。
    英格兰队取得的唯一的一盘胜利是伯尔德在女子单打中以二比零胜池惠芳。
    英格兰队上场的四名男、女选手都是经验丰富的好手，他们采用了西方国家普遍采用的防守战术，但是在年轻中国选手勇猛的攻势下，显得疲于应付。所有的中国选手都采用了变化多端的发球，使对手们一开始就很狼狈。中国选手一有机会就进攻，牢牢地掌握着主动权。
    最精采的一盘比赛是李富荣对哈里森。哈里森打得稳健、防守严密，他把球削得又低又转，常常伺机用反手回击。可是，李富荣进攻得迅速，准确，机智，拉对方两角配合着放短球，使哈里森左右前后来回奔跑，陷入被动而失败。
    这次乒乓球赛是在离伦敦三十多公里的斯劳市举行的。比赛的全部入场参观券早在中国队到达之前就售完了。
    比赛前斯劳市副市长致欢迎词，中国队领队、中国乒乓球协会副主席杜前致答词说，中国乒乓球队的访问将有助于加强中国和英国乒乓球运动员之间的友谊。
    中国驻英国代办宦乡出席观看了这场球赛。
    中国乒乓球队是应英格兰乒乓球协会的邀请到英国访问的。他们将在英国各城市比赛六场。
    今天各盘比赛的详细比分如下：
    男子单打：
    李富荣胜麦雷特二十一比八，二十一比十二。
    庄则栋胜哈里森二十一比十三，二十三比二十一。
    庄则栋胜麦雷特二十一比十九，二十一比十。
    李富荣胜哈里森二十一比十六，二十一比十四。
    男子双打：李富荣和庄则栋胜哈里森和麦雷特二十二比二十，二十一比十八。
    女子单打：胡克明胜摩蒂默二十一比十八，十比二十一，二十一比十四。
    伯尔德胜池惠芳二十一比十二，二十一比十九。
    女子双打：胡克明和池惠芳胜摩蒂默和伯尔德二十一比十二，十七比二十一，二十一比十六。
