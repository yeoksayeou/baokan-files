    People's Heroes—Ordinary Laborers
    Li Yong
    For thousands of years, in the history of our motherland, how many influential and arrogant heroic figures have emerged? However, these so-called heroes mainly refer to emperors, kings, generals, and ministers. But the ordinary masses, who are the real creators of history, have no place on the list of heroes.
    But who are the people attending the meeting of heroes in the Great Hall of the People in front of Tiananmen today? They are steelworkers, mechanical workers, textile workers, construction workers, miners, carpenters, drivers, postmen, telephone operators, shop assistants, cooks, barbers, and cleaners. In a word, ordinary laborers.
    The Party and the people give such great honor to advanced figures in labor based on the following important principles of Marxism-Leninism: the masses are the masters of history and the decisive productive force. Marx pointed out in "The Poverty of Philosophy": "The greatest productive power is the revolutionary class itself." Lenin also expressed this idea at the First All-Russia Congress on Social Education, saying: "The first productive force of all mankind is the worker, the laborer."
    The masses of the people have been the promoters of productivity in all eras. However, in all class societies, the working masses have been trampled at the bottom of history. Therefore, they are rarely concerned with improving productivity, and their intelligence and talents have been greatly suppressed. Only under the socialist system do the working masses work for themselves and for their society, so they are extremely enthusiastic about the rise of production and give full play to their heroic spirit and creative talents. At this meeting of heroes, many representatives excitedly expressed the inspiring power given to them by the new society. This is the secret of why China's productivity has developed so rapidly since liberation.
    Marx wrote in "The Holy Family": "Historical activity is the business of the masses. With the deepening of historical activity, the ranks of the masses will inevitably expand." In our country, socialist practice has also proved this point. Under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, advanced collectives and advanced producers are increasing sharply year by year. This time, more than three million advanced producers and nearly 300,000 advanced collectives have emerged across the country. This number far exceeds the number of people during the first and second meetings of heroes—the 1950 National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, and the 1956 National Congress of Advanced Producers. Our country is a vigorously developing country, miracles happen every day, and heroes emerge everywhere. Historians often call the periods of ancient Greece, Rome, and the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods in our country the age of heroes, but how can they compare with our era!
    In the old days, heroes and the masses were in a position of opposition. "One general succeeds, ten thousand bones wither." The heroes of the old era were only individual heroes. Not to mention the monarchs like Liu Bang and Xiang Yu who "ruled over the people," even Su Qin and Zhang Yi, who traveled to the six countries, were merely pursuing personal wealth and fame and glorifying their ancestors. Yue Fei was a great national hero in ancient China. However, due to the limitations of historical conditions, he was only a loyal minister and good general who "ate the king's salary and repaid the emperor's kindness." But what about our heroes? They are not for personal fame and fortune, but for the common and beautiful socialist construction cause. Therefore, what is valuable about the heroes of the socialist era is not only that they have fully utilized their intelligence and talents to create extraordinary miracles in ordinary labor, but more valuable is that they do not care about personal fame and fortune at all, unconditionally help others, and allow more people to become heroes. Zhao Mengtao, a young female worker at the Northwest No. 1 Cotton Mill, has regarded helping others as her responsibility for six years. When someone else's machine is not working well, she replaces it with her own. Some people worry that she will not be able to achieve the competition target because of constantly changing machines, but Zhao Mengtao replied seriously: "What a communist party member wants is not personal 'reputation', but to lead everyone forward together for the cause and interests of the Party!" What a loud voice this is! It is not heroism for one person to be good, but it is heroism for everyone to be good. This is the characteristic of our socialist all-round Great Leap Forward era, and it is also the common characteristic of all our heroes.
    Development is the process of struggle between the new and the old. Our heroes are the representatives of new things. With the love and support of the people of the whole country and their vanguard, they have eliminated outdated things, criticized the laggards, and promoted the development of the entire social production with this advanced thinking, indicators, and actions. In this way, a competition wave of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced has been set off. In the process of this competition, our ranks of heroes are growing, and the cause of socialist construction is like a multi-stage rocket, with flames shining and rising steadily. This process of competition is a process of struggle between the new and the old. It is this struggle that promotes the continuous and rapid development of our socialist construction; and our heroes are the driving force of this development!

    人民的英雄——普通劳动者
    里庸
    数千年来，在祖国的历史上，出现过多少叱咤风云，不可一世的英雄人物。但是，这些所谓的英雄，指的主要是帝王将相。而作为历史的真正创造者的普通群众，在英雄榜上却没有立椎之地。
    但是今天，在天安门前人民大会堂参加群英会的却是谁呢？他们是钢铁工人、机械工人、纺织工人、建筑工人、矿工、木工、司机、邮递员、话务员、售货员、炊事员、理发员和清洁员。一句话，普通劳动者。
    党和人民给劳动中的先进人物以如此巨大的荣誉，是以马克思列宁主义的下述重要原理为根据的。群众是历史的主人，是起决定作用的生产力。马克思在“哲学的贫困”中指出：“最强大的生产力是革命阶级本身。”列宁在全俄社会教育第一次代表大会上也表述了这个思想，他说：“全人类的第一个生产力就是工人，劳动者。”
    人民群众在所有各个时代中都是生产力的推进者。但是，在一切阶级社会中，劳动群众都被践踏在历史的底层，因此，他们对提高生产率很少关心，他们的聪明才智也受到了极大的压抑。只有在社会主义制度下，劳动群众才是为自己、为自己的社会而劳动，因而他们才以极大的热情关心着生产的高涨，充分发挥出他们的英勇气概和创造才能。这次群英会上，不少代表在发言中，都激动地表达了新社会给予他们的鼓舞力量。解放后我国的生产力之所以能飞速地发展，其秘密就在这里。
    马克思在“神圣家族”中写道：“历史活动是群众的事业。随着历史活动的深入，必将是群众队伍的扩大。”在我们的国家中，社会主义的实践也证明了这一点。在党和毛泽东同志的领导下，先进集体和先进生产者正在逐年猛增。这一次，全国共涌现出了三百多万名先进生产者和近三十万个先进集体。这个数量就远远地超过了第一次和第二次群英会—1950年工农兵劳动模范代表大会和1956年全国先进生产者代表大会时期的人数。我们的国家是一个蓬勃发展的国家，天天出奇迹，处处出英雄。历史家常把古希腊罗马和我国春秋战国的时期叫做英雄的时代，但是它们又怎能和我们的时代相称比！
    在旧时代，英雄和群众是处在对立的地位的。“一将功成万骨枯”，旧时代的英雄都只是个人英雄。且不谈刘邦、项羽这些“统御万民”的君王，就是奔走六国的苏秦、张仪，也无非是追求个人的荣华富贵，扬名显亲。岳飞是我国古代伟大的民族英雄。但是，由于历史条件的限制，他也不过是一个“食君禄，报皇恩”的忠臣良将。而我们的英雄却是怎样呢？他们不是为了个人的名利，而是为了共同的美好的社会主义建设事业。因此，社会主义时代的英雄，可贵的不仅仅是充分运用自己的聪明才智在平凡的劳动中创造了不平凡的奇迹，更可贵的是他们根本不计个人名利，无条件地帮助别人，让更多的人成为英雄。西北国棉一厂年轻的女工赵梦桃，六年如一日地把帮助别人视为自己的责任。当别人的车子不好使时，她就把自己的换给人家。有人担心她因不断换车而实现不了竞赛指标，而赵梦桃却严肃地回答说：“一个共产党员要的不是个人的‘名声’，而是要为党的事业和利益带领大家一道前进！”这是一个多么宏亮的声音！一人好，不算英雄，大家好，才是英雄，这是我们的社会主义全面大跃进时代的特点，也是我们所有的英雄的共同本色。
    发展是新和旧的斗争的过程。我们的英雄就是新生事物的代表者。他们在全国人民及其先锋队的爱护和支持下，以这种先进的思想、指标和行动，消除了陈旧事物，批评了落后者，推动了整个社会生产的发展。这样，一个比先进、学先进和赶先进的竞赛浪潮就掀起来了。在这个竞赛的过程中，我们的英雄队伍就越来越大了，社会主义建设事业就像一支多级飞箭，火光四射，节节高升。这个竞赛的过程，就是一个新和旧的斗争的过程。正是这种斗争，推动着我们社会主义建设不断地迅速地发展；而我们的英雄，就是这个发展的动力！
