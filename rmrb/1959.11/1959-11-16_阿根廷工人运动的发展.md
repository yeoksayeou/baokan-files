The general strike that broke out in Argentina on September 23rd and 24th was organized by the Sixty-Two Unions, the Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation, and a number of independent trade unions. Industrial workers, dockworkers, construction workers, printers, postal workers, transportation workers, people of all professions and different political parties stopped work. The country's commercial and cultural life was paralyzed. This was the first large-scale action taken by the Argentine working people after the above-mentioned trade union federations formed a united trade union front. Its significance for the Argentine workers' movement is enormous. In fact, it opened a new chapter in the history of trade unions fighting together to protect the interests of working people.

This general strike is the development of a series of strike movements by Argentine workers since the Frondizi government implemented reactionary policies.

The government's "economic stabilization plan," drawn up according to the "recommendations" of the International Monetary Fund at the end of 1958, has worsened the country's already serious economic situation. In the first few months of implementing this plan, the financial situation deteriorated sharply, the Argentine peso depreciated, inflation intensified, the country's dependence on foreign countries increased, and foreign capital poured in. At the same time, the prices of food and industrial products rose sharply, and the cost of public utilities increased. According to official statistics, from January to August 1959, the cost of living rose by 87.5%. The price of milk increased sixfold, bread threefold, meat threefold to fourfold, and cream fourfold. Electricity bills more than doubled, and fuel doubled. In September, the prices of liquid fuel and fuel rose again. Economic Minister Alsogaray admitted that this would cause transportation costs to rise and the prices of food and consumer goods to rise again.

Because the government's "economic stabilization plan" has brought extremely serious consequences to the working people, working people from all walks of life have continuously participated in strikes. There is not a single sector of the national economy that has not experienced serious actions by working people demanding increased wages, improved living and working conditions, protection of trade union rights and national and ethnic interests.

At the beginning of 1959, a general strike broke out, involving more than four million people. On April 3, a general strike broke out again. The strikers demanded that the government stop interfering in trade union affairs, increase wages, and meet many other demands. On May 15, a new general strike was held, in which the vast majority of the country's trade unions participated. In July, more than one million agricultural workers held a two-day general strike. Many strikes lasted for weeks or even months. According to obviously incomplete official statistics, there were 39 strikes in February, 77 in March, 75 in April, 77 in May, 61 in June, and 65 in August.

The Argentine ruling group has taken repressive measures against the strike movement, using batons, tear gas, guns, and even tanks to disperse gatherings and demonstrations. However, repression has aroused widespread dissatisfaction in the country. These suppressions have not destroyed the fighting spirit of the working people and their determination to defend their rights, but have instead promoted the united action of Argentine workers, enabling the divided trade union federations to embark on the road of common struggle. The great significance of the September general strike lies here.

Experience in recent years has shown that without unity in the trade union ranks, it is impossible for the working people to effectively protect their rights, resist the attacks of business owners and imperialism, and improve their living and working conditions.

The basic masses of the Argentine working class had already united under the General Confederation of Labor, established in 1931. In 1957, the General Confederation of Labor had a total of 2.42 million members. During Peron's rule, the General Confederation of Labor executed the Peronist Party's instructions under the influence of the government. After Peron's downfall in September 1955, due to the provisional government's interference in the affairs of the General Confederation of Labor, the trade unions split, forming three major trade union groups: the Sixty-Two Unions, the Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation, and the Thirty-Two Unions. There was no complete unity within each federation.

In terms of the number of trade unions, the Sixty-Two Unions, led by Peronists, ranked first. This federation was created after the failure of the National Congress held by the General Confederation of Labor in August 1957.

This federation includes the country's major trade unions. For example, the Metallurgical Workers' Union with 300,000 members, the Textile Workers' Union with 200,000 members, the Tucum√°n Province Sugar Industry Workers' Union with 100,000 members, the Meat Industry Workers' Federation with 50,000 members, and so on. There are also smaller trade unions under the leadership of Peronists, which include almost all local branches of the General Confederation of Labor.

The leading body of the Sixty-Two Unions pointed out in its program that it must fight for national independence, for the protection of national industry and the country's natural wealth, and against the government's "economic stabilization plan" imposed by the International Monetary Fund.

Under the pressure of ordinary members who advocated taking joint action with other trade unions, the majority of the leading committee of the federation and many important trade unions demanded the establishment of a united trade union front.

The Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation (formerly the Nineteen Unions) is another trade union federation. This is one of the most progressive and militant federations. It leads the trade unions that are at the forefront of the workers' movement fighting to meet the demands of the working people, including the Construction Workers' Union (with about 300,000 members), the Bank Employees' Federation (50,000 members), the Chemical Workers' Union, the Telephone Bureau Workers' Union, and the Buenos Aires Commercial Workers' Union, and so on.

The Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation pursues a policy of striving to unite all working people and establish a unified trade union center that is not affiliated with the government and business owners. It advocates revising the law on professional organizations of working people, opposes the government's control of the election of trade union leading bodies, opposes the right to revoke legally elected trade union organizations, and opposes the government's dispatch of supervisors to interfere in trade union affairs.

The Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation is the initiator of the struggle for the unity of the working class ranks. In the current period of establishing a unified trade union center, the role of the Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation has especially increased.

The Thirty-Two Unions group is led by right-wing Socialists, and participating in this group are the Railway Workers' Union (280,000 members), the Argentine Commercial Workers' Federation, the Sewing Workers' Union, and so on. The right-wing Socialists had already controlled this trade union federation in 1955 through the provisional government's interference in trade union affairs.

But it is not unified internally, and the vast majority of ordinary members disagree with the leadership of the group.

Under the guise of opposing Communists and Peronists, the Thirty-Two Unions leadership group refused to hold talks with the Sixty-Two Unions and the Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation on the issue of taking joint action by the working class. They pursue a policy of dividing the ranks of the trade union movement. On the other hand, in order to establish "prestige" among ordinary members, the leaders of the Thirty-Two Unions also criticized the government and its "economic stabilization plan." The divisive activities carried out by the right-wing Socialist leaders of the group were particularly evident in the recent general strike held from September 23rd to 24th. Five days before the general strike broke out, the Railway Workers' Union held a strike and made demands on the government, which were not met. On September 23rd, it was decided to strike again, this strike coincided with the national general strike. The leaders of the Thirty-Two Unions, who did not participate in the general strike, persuaded the railway workers to reach an agreement with the capitalists, refusing to take joint action with the country's main working masses.

However, this kind of divisive activity aroused dissatisfaction among the broad masses of workers and many trade unions. Many trade unions passed resolutions, and ordinary workers and trade union leaders delivered speeches, demanding that trade unions take consistent action. Many enterprises have established "united action committees" jointly consisting of Communists, Socialists, Peronists, Radicals, and non-party people. In many places, workers of different parties have automatically achieved unity.

The Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation is actively carrying out activities to strive for all trade union organizations to unite on the basis of the common minimum demands of all working people and to establish a unified General Confederation of Labor. Ordinary Peronists have left the leaders of their own trade unions who attempted to support the government's economic policies. The working class is uniting and has a realistic foundation. After two months of negotiations, the Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation, the Sixty-Two Unions, and three independent trade unions (the Telegraph Operators' Federation, the Argentine Electricity Workers' Union, and the Flight Attendants' Federation) reached an agreement on August 14th on "future trade union activities will be carried out in collaboration on the basis of a common struggle program" (without the Thirty-Two Unions), and passed a thirteen-point common program. The program pointed out that, in view of the government's various persecutions of the workers' movement, it was decided to conduct a joint struggle nationwide to fight for the right to freely sign collective labor contracts and to conduct an effective struggle against the rising cost of living.

These railway workers held a strike at the end of last year to protest the management's delay in issuing the already determined additional wages, and were therefore arrested by the government.
