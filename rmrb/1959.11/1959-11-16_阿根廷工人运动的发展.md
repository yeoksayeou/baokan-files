The general strike that broke out in Argentina on September 23rd and 24th was organized by the Sixty-Two Unions, the Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation, and a number of independent trade unions. Industrial workers, dockworkers, construction workers, printers, postal workers, transportation workers, people of all professions and different political parties stopped work. The country's commercial and cultural life was paralyzed. This was the first large-scale action taken by the Argentine working people after the above-mentioned trade union federations formed a united trade union front. Its significance for the Argentine workers' movement is enormous. In fact, it opened a new chapter in the history of trade unions fighting together to protect the interests of working people.

This general strike is the development of a series of strike movements by Argentine workers since the Frondizi government implemented reactionary policies.

The government's "economic stabilization plan," drawn up according to the "recommendations" of the International Monetary Fund at the end of 1958, has worsened the country's already serious economic situation. In the first few months of implementing this plan, the financial situation deteriorated sharply, the Argentine peso depreciated, inflation intensified, the country's dependence on foreign countries increased, and foreign capital poured in. At the same time, the prices of food and industrial products rose sharply, and the cost of public utilities increased. According to official statistics, from January to August 1959, the cost of living rose by 87.5%. The price of milk increased sixfold, bread threefold, meat threefold to fourfold, and cream fourfold. Electricity bills more than doubled, and fuel doubled. In September, the prices of liquid fuel and fuel rose again. Economic Minister Alsogaray admitted that this would cause transportation costs to rise and the prices of food and consumer goods to rise again.

Because the government's "economic stabilization plan" has brought extremely serious consequences to the working people, working people from all walks of life have continuously participated in strikes. There is not a single sector of the national economy that has not experienced serious actions by working people demanding increased wages, improved living and working conditions, protection of trade union rights and national and ethnic interests.

At the beginning of 1959, a general strike broke out, involving more than four million people. On April 3, a general strike broke out again. The strikers demanded that the government stop interfering in trade union affairs, increase wages, and meet many other demands. On May 15, a new general strike was held, in which the vast majority of the country's trade unions participated. In July, more than one million agricultural workers held a two-day general strike. Many strikes lasted for weeks or even months. According to obviously incomplete official statistics, there were 39 strikes in February, 77 in March, 75 in April, 77 in May, 61 in June, and 65 in August.

The Argentine ruling group has taken repressive measures against the strike movement, using batons, tear gas, guns, and even tanks to disperse gatherings and demonstrations. However, repression has aroused widespread dissatisfaction in the country. These suppressions have not destroyed the fighting spirit of the working people and their determination to defend their rights, but have instead promoted the united action of Argentine workers, enabling the divided trade union federations to embark on the road of common struggle. The great significance of the September general strike lies here.

Experience in recent years has shown that without unity in the trade union ranks, it is impossible for the working people to effectively protect their rights, resist the attacks of business owners and imperialism, and improve their living and working conditions.

The basic masses of the Argentine working class had already united under the General Confederation of Labor, established in 1931. In 1957, the General Confederation of Labor had a total of 2.42 million members. During Peron's rule, the General Confederation of Labor executed the Peronist Party's instructions under the influence of the government. After Peron's downfall in September 1955, due to the provisional government's interference in the affairs of the General Confederation of Labor, the trade unions split, forming three major trade union groups: the Sixty-Two Unions, the Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation, and the Thirty-Two Unions. There was no complete unity within each federation.

In terms of the number of trade unions, the Sixty-Two Unions, led by Peronists, ranked first. This federation was created after the failure of the National Congress held by the General Confederation of Labor in August 1957.

This federation includes the country's major trade unions. For example, the Metallurgical Workers' Union with 300,000 members, the Textile Workers' Union with 200,000 members, the Tucumán Province Sugar Industry Workers' Union with 100,000 members, the Meat Industry Workers' Federation with 50,000 members, and so on. There are also smaller trade unions under the leadership of Peronists, which include almost all local branches of the General Confederation of Labor.

The leading body of the Sixty-Two Unions pointed out in its program that it must fight for national independence, for the protection of national industry and the country's natural wealth, and against the government's "economic stabilization plan" imposed by the International Monetary Fund.

Under the pressure of ordinary members who advocated taking joint action with other trade unions, the majority of the leading committee of the federation and many important trade unions demanded the establishment of a united trade union front.

The Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation (formerly the Nineteen Unions) is another trade union federation. This is one of the most progressive and militant federations. It leads the trade unions that are at the forefront of the workers' movement fighting to meet the demands of the working people, including the Construction Workers' Union (with about 300,000 members), the Bank Employees' Federation (50,000 members), the Chemical Workers' Union, the Telephone Bureau Workers' Union, and the Buenos Aires Commercial Workers' Union, and so on.

The Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation pursues a policy of striving to unite all working people and establish a unified trade union center that is not affiliated with the government and business owners. It advocates revising the law on professional organizations of working people, opposes the government's control of the election of trade union leading bodies, opposes the right to revoke legally elected trade union organizations, and opposes the government's dispatch of supervisors to interfere in trade union affairs.

The Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation is the initiator of the struggle for the unity of the working class ranks. In the current period of establishing a unified trade union center, the role of the Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation has especially increased.

The Thirty-Two Unions group is led by right-wing Socialists, and participating in this group are the Railway Workers' Union (280,000 members), the Argentine Commercial Workers' Federation, the Sewing Workers' Union, and so on. The right-wing Socialists had already controlled this trade union federation in 1955 through the provisional government's interference in trade union affairs.

But it is not unified internally, and the vast majority of ordinary members disagree with the leadership of the group.

Under the guise of opposing Communists and Peronists, the Thirty-Two Unions leadership group refused to hold talks with the Sixty-Two Unions and the Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation on the issue of taking joint action by the working class. They pursue a policy of dividing the ranks of the trade union movement. On the other hand, in order to establish "prestige" among ordinary members, the leaders of the Thirty-Two Unions also criticized the government and its "economic stabilization plan." The divisive activities carried out by the right-wing Socialist leaders of the group were particularly evident in the recent general strike held from September 23rd to 24th. Five days before the general strike broke out, the Railway Workers' Union held a strike and made demands on the government, which were not met. On September 23rd, it was decided to strike again, this strike coincided with the national general strike. The leaders of the Thirty-Two Unions, who did not participate in the general strike, persuaded the railway workers to reach an agreement with the capitalists, refusing to take joint action with the country's main working masses.

However, this kind of divisive activity aroused dissatisfaction among the broad masses of workers and many trade unions. Many trade unions passed resolutions, and ordinary workers and trade union leaders delivered speeches, demanding that trade unions take consistent action. Many enterprises have established "united action committees" jointly consisting of Communists, Socialists, Peronists, Radicals, and non-party people. In many places, workers of different parties have automatically achieved unity.

The Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation is actively carrying out activities to strive for all trade union organizations to unite on the basis of the common minimum demands of all working people and to establish a unified General Confederation of Labor. Ordinary Peronists have left the leaders of their own trade unions who attempted to support the government's economic policies. The working class is uniting and has a realistic foundation. After two months of negotiations, the Movement for Trade Union Unity and Cooperation, the Sixty-Two Unions, and three independent trade unions (the Telegraph Operators' Federation, the Argentine Electricity Workers' Union, and the Flight Attendants' Federation) reached an agreement on August 14th on "future trade union activities will be carried out in collaboration on the basis of a common struggle program" (without the Thirty-Two Unions), and passed a thirteen-point common program. The program pointed out that, in view of the government's various persecutions of the workers' movement, it was decided to conduct a joint struggle nationwide to fight for the right to freely sign collective labor contracts and to conduct an effective struggle against the rising cost of living.

These railway workers held a strike at the end of last year to protest the management's delay in issuing the already determined additional wages, and were therefore arrested by the government.

    阿根廷工人运动的发展
    辛木
    阿根廷在9月23日到24日爆发的总罢工，是由六十二工会、工会团结合作运动和一批独立工会组织的。工业工人、码头工人、建筑工人、印刷工人、邮政工作人员、运输工人，各种职业和不同政党的人都停止了工作。国家的商业和文化生活均陷于瘫痪。这是阿根廷劳动人民在上述工会联合会成立统一工会阵线以后所采取的第一次大规模的行动。它对阿根廷工人运动的意义是巨大的。实际上，它在工会为保护劳动人民的利益而进行共同斗争的历史上打开了新的一页。
    这次的总罢工，是弗朗迪西政府执行反动政策以来，阿根廷工人一系列罢工运动的发展。
    根据“国际货币基金组织”在1958年底的“建议”而拟订的政府“经济稳定计划”，使国家本来就已经很严重的经济情况恶化了。还在实行这个计划的头几个月，财政情况就急剧恶化，阿根廷比索贬值，通货膨胀加剧，国家对外国的依赖增加，外国资本大举渗入。与此同时，食品和工业品的价格纷纷上涨，公用设施用费增加。根据官方的统计，从1959年1月到8月，生活费用上涨了87.5％。牛奶价格增加了六倍，面包增加三倍，肉增加三倍到四倍，奶油增加四倍。电费增加了一倍多，燃料增加了两倍。9月份液体燃料和燃料的价格再次上涨。经济部长阿耳索加赖承认，这将引起运输费上涨和食品及消费品的价格再次上涨。
    由于政府的“经济稳定计划”给劳动人民带来了极为严重的后果，各阶层的劳动人民不断参加罢工。国民经济中没有一个部门没发生过劳动人民要求增加工资、改善生活和劳动条件、保护工会权利和国家民族利益的严重行动。
    1959年一开始，就发生了一起总罢工，参加这次总罢工的有四百多万人。4月3日重新爆发了总罢工。罢工者要求政府停止干涉工会事务，增加工资和满足许多其他要求。5月15日举行了新的总罢工，国家的绝大多数工会都参加了这次罢工。7月一百多万农业工人举行了两天总罢工。许多罢工延续了几周甚至是几个月。据显然是不完全的官方统计，2月发生了三十九起罢工，3月—七十七起，4月—七十五起，5月—七十七起，6月—六十一起，8月—六十五起。
    阿根廷统治集团对罢工运动采取镇压措施，为了驱散集会和示威群众，使用了警棍、催泪弹、枪炮、甚至是坦克。但是，镇压引起了国内的普遍不满。这些镇压并没能摧毁劳动人民的战斗精神和他们保卫自己权利的决心，反而促成了阿根廷工人的统一行动，使得分裂的各种工会联合会开始走上共同斗争的道路。9月的总罢工的重大意义，就在这里。
    近几年来的经验表明，工会队伍缺乏统一，劳动人民就不可能有效地保护自己的权利，就不可能抵抗企业主和帝国主义的进攻和改善生活与劳动条件。
    阿根廷工人阶级的基本群众早就在1931年成立的总工会下联合起来了。总工会在1957年共有会员二百四十二万人。在庇隆执政时期，总工会是在政府的影响下执行庇隆党的指令。在1955年9月庇隆垮台以后，由于临时政府对总工会事务的干预，工会便发生了分裂，形成了三个主要工会集团：六十二工会、工会团结合作运动和三十二工会。每个联合会内部都没有完整的统一。
    从工会的数量来说，庇隆分子所领导的六十二工会占第一位。这个联合会是在总工会于1957年8月举行的全国大会失败以后产生的。
    该联合会包括了国内的各大工会。例如其中拥有三十万会员的冶金工人工会、拥有二十万会员的纺织工人工会；拥有十万会员的图库曼省糖业工人工会；拥有五万会员的肉业工人联合会等等。在庇隆分子领导下的还有比较小的工会，其中几乎包括了总工会的所有地方分会。　　　
    六十二工会的领导机构在自己的纲领里指出必须为民族独立，为保护民族工业和国家的自然财富，为反对“国际货币基金组织”强加的政府“经济稳定计划”而斗争。
    在主张同其他工会采取联合行动的普通会员的压力下，该联合会领导委员会中的多数和许多重要工会纷纷要求成立统一的工会阵线。
    工会团结合作运动（前十九工会）是另一个工会联合会。这是一个最进步最具有战斗性的联合会。它领导着那些站在争取满足劳动人民要求的工人运动最前锋的工会进行斗争，其中有建筑工人工会（有三十万左右会员）、银行职员联合会（五万会员）、化学工人工会、电话局职工工会和布宜诺斯艾利斯商业职工工会等等。
    工会团结合作运动奉行争取团结所有劳动人民和建立一个不附属于政府和企业主的统一工会中心的政策。它主张修改劳动人民职业团体法，反对政府控制工会领导机构的选举，反对撤销合法选出的工会机构的权利，反对政府派遣督导员干预工会事务。
    工会团结合作运动是为工人阶级队伍的团结而斗争的创议者。在目前成立统一工会中心的时期，工会团结合作运动的作用尤其增加了。
    三十二工会集团是由右翼社会党人领导的，参加这一集团的有铁路工人工会（二十八万会员）、阿根廷商业职工联合会、缝纫工会等等。右翼社会党人还在1955年就通过临时政府对工会事务的干预而控制了这个工会联合会。　　　
    但它的内部不统一，绝大多数普通会员都不同意该集团的领导。
    三十二工会领导集团在反对共产党人和庇隆分子的口号掩盖下，拒绝就工人阶级采取联合行动问题同六十二工会和工会团结合作运动进行会谈。他们奉行的是分裂工会运动队伍的政策。另一方面，为了在普通会员中树立“威信”，三十二工会领导也批评政府及其“经济稳定计划”。该集团右派社会党领导人所进行的分裂活动，在9月23日到24日举行的最近这次总罢工中特别明显地表现出来。在总罢工爆发的前五天，铁路工人工会举行了罢工，并向政府提出了要求，这些要求没有得到满足。在9月23日再次决定罢工，这次罢工同国内的总罢工不谋而合了。没有参加总罢工的三十二工会领导人说服了铁路员工同资方达成协议，拒绝同国内主要劳动大众采取联合行动。
    但是，这一种分裂活动引起了广大工人群众和许多工会的不满。许多工会通过决议，普通工人和工会领袖发表讲话，要求工会采取一致行动。许多企业纷纷成立联合着共产党人、社会党人、庇隆党人、激进主义者和无党派人士的“一致行动委员会”。在许多地方不同党派的工人自动地取得了一致。
    工会团结合作运动积极进行活动，争取所有工会组织在全体劳动人民共同最低要求的基础上联合起来和成立统一的总工会。普通的庇隆党人纷纷离开了企图支持政府经济政策的自己工会的领导人。工人阶级联合起来已经有了现实的基础。工会团结合作运动、六十二工会和三个独立工会（电报报务员联合会、阿根廷电力工会、航空乘务员联合会）经过两个月的谈判，在8月14日已经就“未来的工会活动在共同斗争纲领的基础上进行协作”达成了协议（没有三十二工会），并且通过了十三点共同纲领。纲领指出，鉴于政府对工人运动的种种迫害，决定为争取自由签订集体劳动合同的权利在全国范围进行共同斗争和为反对生活费用上涨进行有效的斗争。
