    Praising the Advanced Should Be Comprehensive

    The article “An Guo Spirit” on page eight of the October 30th edition had some statements that were not comprehensive or realistic. For example, the article said: "If you ask the neighbors of An Guo for directions: How do I get to An Guo? The answer is always: 'Just keep going, you'll see that the crops are different, you'll see land that is especially well-cultivated, and that's when you'll have entered An Guo's borders.'"

    According to my understanding, to get to An Guo from Beijing, one generally has to go through Ding County and then transfer to An Guo, passing through the Qingfengdian, Dingzhou, and Dongting communes of Ding County along the way. This year, the average grain yield per mu in these three communes is above 1,000 jin or close to 1,000 jin, no lower than An Guo. Are their crops really like the author described? I believe that when praising advanced areas, one should not belittle the surrounding areas. Articles should be more comprehensive.

    表扬先进要全面
    10月30日八版“安国精神”一文，有些提法不够全面和切合实际。如文中说：“你去向安国的四邻问路：到安国去怎样走？回答总是：‘往前走吧，你看到庄稼不一样了，看见了种得特别好的地，那就是进了安国的边了。’”
    据我了解从北京到安国一般都要经由定县转道安国，沿途要经过定县的清风店、定州、东亭三个公社。今年这三个社的粮食平均亩产都在千斤以上或接近千斤，不低于安国。他们的庄稼，难道是像作者所说的那样吗？我认为在歌颂先进地区的时候，不要贬低周围的地区，写文章要全面些。
