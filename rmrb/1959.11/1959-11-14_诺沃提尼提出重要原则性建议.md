Regarding the Further Rapid and Comprehensive Development of Czechoslovakia
	Novotný Puts Forward Important Guiding Principles
	According to the new circumstances of national economic development and the principle of democratic centralism, the regional division of the People's Committees should be changed; according to the principle of voluntariness, several agricultural cooperatives can be merged; during the third five-year plan, working hours should be reduced on the basis of production development; representatives elected by the people should handle minor crimes....

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 13th. "Red Right Newspaper" today published detailed excerpts from two speeches made by Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, at the Central Committee meeting on September 23rd and the meeting of responsible cadres of the Party on October 29th, under the title "On Major Issues Concerning the Completion of Socialist Construction."

Novotný said, "The victory of socialism in Czechoslovakia has essentially become a reality." He pointed out that the development of a socialist society raises a number of new questions, and these questions must be resolved to prevent further development of society from being hindered.

In this regard, Novotný put forward a series of guiding principles that are extremely important for the further rapid and comprehensive development of Czechoslovakia. The first of these is the issue of changing the regional division of the People's Committees. He said that due to social development, the existing regional division is no longer suitable. The current three-tier system—state, county, and township People's Committees—should be retained, but the regional division should be adjusted according to the new circumstances and needs of national economic development. The re-division of regions and the readjustment of People's Committees should continue to be based on the principle of democratic centralism; the centralized leadership of the central government on certain basic issues should be combined with the expansion of the powers and responsibilities of local People's Committees in administrative management, and with the maximum mobilization of the broad masses of working people to participate in management and give play to their initiative.

He also asked the meeting to consider the issue of merging two or three villages and towns (local administrative units) into one village and town. He pointed out that this must be premised on conditions being conducive to the merger.

Novotný also suggested that if all conditions are ripe and villagers and cooperative members are willing, several unified agricultural cooperatives with 150 to 200 hectares of cultivated land should be merged.

Novotný particularly emphasized the need to politically and organizationally strengthen the township People's Committees so that they can effectively carry out future tasks.

Novotný said that to carry out all these changes, it is necessary to revise the Czechoslovak Constitution, which means that a new socialist constitution must be formulated. He said that the adoption of this constitution will be the primary task of the newly elected National Assembly in the autumn of 1960.

Novotný also talked about reducing working hours during the third five-year plan (1961-1965) on the basis of production development.

Another important suggestion put forward by Novotný concerned the method of exercising judicial power. He suggested that relatively minor offenses should no longer be tried by the courts, but should be handled by new judicial bodies composed of representatives elected by the people. The trials of these cases will be conducted with the participation of the people, in workplaces and public gatherings, and other occasions.

In his speech, Novotný also pointed out the achievements made in national economic construction this year. He said that the targets for industry, construction, and transportation are expected to be exceeded in 1959. In this way, industrial production in the last two years of the second five-year plan (1959-1960) will increase by 21%, while the original stipulation was 16%. This year's harvest and procurement of agricultural products are satisfactory. It is estimated that the average yield of grain is twenty-three quintals per hectare.

### 诺沃提尼提出重要原则性建议

    就捷克斯洛伐克进一步迅速和全面发展问题
    诺沃提尼提出重要原则性建议
    根据国民经济发展新情况和民主集中制原则，应改变人民委员会的地区划分；根据自愿原则，几个农业社可以加以合并；在第三个五年计划期间，在发展生产基础上缩短工作日；由人民选举代表处理轻微犯罪……。
    新华社布拉格13日电　“红色权利报”今天以“关于完成社会主义建设的重大问题”为标题，刊载了捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记诺沃提尼在9月23日举行的党中央委员会会议和10月29日举行的党的负责干部会议上的两次讲话的详细摘要。
    诺沃提尼说：“社会主义在捷克斯洛伐克的胜利在实质上已经成为现实”。他指出，社会主义社会的发展提出了若干新的问题，要使社会的进一步发展不致受到阻碍，就必须解决这些问题。
    在这方面，诺沃提尼提出了一系列对于捷克斯洛伐克的进一步迅速和全面的发展极为重要的原则性的建议。其中，首先是改变人民委员会的地区划分问题。他说，由于社会的发展，现有的地区划分已经不适合了。目前的三级制——州、县、乡人民委员会——继续保留，但是，地区划分应该根据国民经济发展的新情况和需要来加以调整。地区的重新划分和人民委员会的重新调整，应继续以民主集中制原则为根据；应当使中央对某些基本问题的集中领导同扩大地方人民委员会在行政管理方面的权力和责任、同最大限度地发动广大劳动人民参加管理和发挥他们的主动性结合起来。
    他还提请会议考虑把两、三个村镇（地方行政单位）合并为一个村镇的问题。他指出，这必须以条件有利于合并为前提。
    诺沃提尼还建议，如果一切条件成熟，村民和合作社的社员们愿意，就把几个拥有一百五十到二百公顷耕地的统一农业合作社加以合并。
    诺沃提尼特别强调必须在政治上和组织上加强乡人民委员会，以便使它能有效地执行未来的任务。
    诺沃提尼说，进行所有这些变革，就必须修改捷克斯洛伐克宪法，这意味着必须制订一部新的社会主义宪法。他说，通过这个宪法，将是1960年秋天新选出的国民议会的首要任务。
    诺沃提尼还谈到了在第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）期间在发展生产的基础上缩短工作日的问题。
    诺沃提尼提出的另一个重要建议是有关行使司法权的方法问题。他建议，比较轻微的过错不再由法庭来审理，而由人民选举代表组成的新的司法机构来处理。审讯这些案件将在人民的参加下，在工作场所和公众集会等场合进行。
    诺沃提尼在讲话中还指出了今年国民经济建设所取得的成就。他说，工业、建筑业和运输业1959年的指标可望超过。这样，第二个五年计划最后二年（1959—1960年）的工业生产将增长21％，而原来规定的是16％。今年农产品的收成和收购都是令人满意的，据估计，谷物的平均产量为每公顷二十三公担。
