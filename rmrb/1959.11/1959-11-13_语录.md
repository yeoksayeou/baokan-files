Quotations

　　Factory inspectors soon discovered, after listening to the testimony of schoolteachers, that although factory children received half as much education as regular daytime students, they learned as much, and often more. ... As Owen has detailed, the germ of the education of the future is emerging from the factory system, an education that combines productive labor with instruction and gymnastics for every child beyond a certain age, which is not only a means of increasing social production, but also the only method of producing fully developed human beings.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Marx: "Capital," Volume I)

　　We should cultivate a large army of proletarian intellectuals, who should, together with their brothers of manual labor, play a huge role in the coming revolution.
　　Previous bourgeois revolutions only required universities to cultivate lawyers, whom they used as good raw material from which to create their political activists. For the liberation of the working class, in addition to these, we also need doctors, engineers, chemists, agronomists and other experts, because in the future we will grasp not only the political machine, but also the entire social production, which requires rich and solid knowledge, not resounding slogans.
　　　　　　　　　　　　(Engels: "To the International Conference of Socialist Students")

　　Without the combination of the education of the young generation and productive labor, the ideal of future society is unimaginable: neither teaching and education detached from productive labor, nor productive labor without simultaneous teaching and education, can reach the level required by modern technology and the current state of scientific knowledge. (Lenin: "A Grand Synthesis of Populist Utopian Plans")

　　What did the youth of Yan'an do? They are studying revolutionary theory, studying the principles and methods of resisting Japan and saving the country. They are implementing the production movement, developing thousands of acres of wasteland. Even Confucius did not do the matter of reclaiming wasteland and farming. When Confucius ran a school, he had quite a few students, "seventy worthies and three thousand disciples," which can be described as flourishing. But his students were far fewer than in Yan'an, and they did not like any production movement. When his students asked him how to plow the fields, he said, "I don't know, I'm not as good as a farmer." When asked how to grow vegetables, he said, "I don't know, I'm not as good as a vegetable gardener." In ancient China, the youth who studied with the sages not only did not study revolutionary theory, but also did not engage in labor. Now, in schools in vast areas of the country, there is not much revolutionary theory, and the production movement is not emphasized either. Only the youth in Yan'an and the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines are fundamentally different. They are truly the vanguards of resisting Japan and saving the country, because their political direction is correct and their working methods are also correct.

    语录
    工厂视察员在听取学校教师的证明以后，很快就发觉，工厂儿童与正规地白天上学的学生比较，虽然受教育的时间少一半，但学的东西一样多，而且往往更多。……正如欧文详细说明过的那样，从工厂制度中产生了未来时代的教育的萌芽，这种教育使每一个超过一定年龄的儿童把生产劳动跟上课和体操结合起来，这不仅是增加社会生产的一个手段，并且是培养全面发展的人的唯一方法。
                                （马克思：“资本论”第一卷）
    应该培养出一支脑力劳动的无产阶级大军，这支大军应当同自己的体力劳动的弟兄们一起，在即将来临的革命中发挥巨大的作用。
    以往的资产阶级革命只要求大学培养律师，他们把这批人做为良好的原始材料，从其中制造出他们的政治活动家。为了工人阶级的解放，除这些而外，还需要医生，工程师，化学家，农学家和其他专家，因为将来我们要掌握的不仅是政治机器，而且是整个社会生产，这里需要丰富而踏实的知识，不是响亮的词句。
              　（恩格斯：“致社会主义者大学生国际会议”）
    没有年轻一代的教育和生产劳动的结合，未来社会的理想是不能想像的：无论是脱离生产劳动的教学和教育，或是没有同时进行教学和教育的生产劳动，都不能达到现代技术水平和科学知识现状所要求的高度。（列宁：“集民粹主义空想计划之大成”）
    延安的青年们干了些什么呢？他们在学习革命的理论，研究抗日救国的道理和方法。他们在实行生产运动，开发了千亩万亩的荒地。开荒种地这件事，连孔夫子也没有做过。孔子办学校的时候，他的学生也不少，“贤人七十，弟子三千”，可谓盛矣。但是他的学生比起延安来就少得多，而且不喜欢什么生产运动。他的学生向他请教如何耕田，他就说：“不知道，我不如农民”。又问如何种菜，他又说：“不知道，我不如种菜的”。中国古代在圣人那里读书的青年们，不但没有学过革命的理论，而且不实行劳动。现在全国广大地方的学校，革命理论不多，生产运动也不讲。只有我们延安和各敌后抗日根据地的青年们根本不同，他们真是抗日救国的先锋，因为他们的政治方向是正确的，工作方法也是正确的。　　（毛泽东：“青年运动的方向”）
