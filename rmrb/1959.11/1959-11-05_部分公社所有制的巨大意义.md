The Great Significance of Partial Commune Ownership

Right-leaning opportunists believe that the people's communes have no advantages whatsoever, that there is no difference between the people's communes and advanced agricultural cooperatives, and that the communization movement is unnecessary. This is complete nonsense that ignores the facts.

The people's communes are the same as advanced agricultural cooperatives in that they are socialist in nature, but they are different in many ways. Advanced cooperatives are relatively small collectives, while people's communes are much larger collectives; advanced cooperatives only engage in agriculture, while people's communes are comprehensive operators of multiple economies; advanced cooperatives are only economic organizations, while people's communes are unified organizations of politics, economics, military affairs, and culture; advanced cooperatives are only organizers of collective production, while people's communes are also organizers of collective life. In addition, we must see that the biggest change after communization is the change in ownership. In the past, there was only advanced cooperative ownership equivalent to today's production team and partial ownership by the small team, but today there is commune ownership that did not exist in the past and contains certain elements of ownership by the whole people, such as commune-run enterprises, commune-run undertakings, and accumulation funds and public welfare funds under the control of the commune. The emergence of commune ownership after communization is the most fundamental difference before and after communization. Because of commune ownership, it is possible to link the production teams, which are equivalent to the original advanced cooperatives, into a unified organism from an economic point of view; otherwise, the production teams would still be independent of each other, and there would be no fundamental difference before and after communization. Therefore, it can be said that commune ownership is the basic condition for the existence of the commune organization. Without commune ownership, there would be no people's commune. Right-leaning opportunists ignore the objective existence of commune ownership and all the changes arising from it, and believe that there is no difference between the people's commune and the advanced cooperative, which is completely unfounded.

Although commune ownership has not been established for long, and it is only partial in the three-level ownership system currently implemented in the people's commune, it has shown unlimited vitality at present because it is a new thing, and it has great development prospects in the future.

Because of the great promotion of commune ownership to production team ownership, and because the good production of production teams cannot be separated from the support of commune-run enterprises and commune-run undertakings, production team ownership and commune ownership have formed an inseparable link; whether the production of each production team is good or not will affect the commune's accumulation and thus affect the economic interests of other production teams. Therefore, through commune ownership, the production teams are linked into a whole. After communization, although the ownership of each production team is basic, it is already different from the advanced cooperative. In order to make the best use of people's talents, land, and materials, and to better promote the development of commune-run enterprises, commune-run undertakings, and the agricultural and sideline production of production teams, production teams must obey the unified planning of the commune in production, and the distribution plan must also be decided by the commune. The commune has the obligation to help each production team economically, and also has the right to extract public accumulation from the production team. Therefore, the production team has changed from an economically completely independent advanced cooperative to one that is both independent and not independent. It has become a part of the people's commune. All of these make the commune-level leadership greatly different from the past township-level leadership. It can not only conduct political and ideological leadership, but also has economic power. It is more likely than in the past to organize production and determine distribution according to the party's policies and national plans.

Commune ownership greatly promotes production team ownership, and the result of the development of production team ownership in turn promotes the increasing growth of commune ownership itself. First, commune-run enterprises and commune-run undertakings have developed in the process of promoting the economic development of production teams; second, the rise of the production team economy provides the commune with more accumulation. Therefore, at present, it is necessary to actively develop commune-run enterprises and commune-run undertakings on the premise of recognizing basic production team ownership. This is an important link in consolidating and developing the people's commune and promoting the great leap forward in rural production; it is also a necessary condition for the transition to ownership by the whole people in the future.

### 部分公社所有制的巨大意义

    部分公社所有制的巨大意义
    右倾机会主义分子认为人民公社根本没有什么优越性，认为人民公社和高级农业社没有什么区别，公社化运动是不必要的。这完全是一种不顾事实的胡说。
    人民公社在社会主义性质这一点上与高级农业社是相同的，但在许多方面又是不同的。高级社比较起来是小集体，人民公社是大得多的集体；高级社只经营农业，人民公社是多种经济的综合经营者；高级社只是经济组织，人民公社是政治、经济、军事、文化的统一组织；高级社只是集体生产的组织者，人民公社同时又是集体生活的组织者。此外，我们必须看到，公社化以后一个最大的变化，是所有制的变化。过去只有相当于今天生产队的高级社所有制和小队的部分所有制，而今天已经有了过去所没有的、包含着某种全民所有制成分的公社所有制，如社办企业、社办事业、由公社支配的公积金和公益金等。公社化以后出现了公社所有制，是公社化前后最根本的不同点。因为有了公社所有制，才能够从经济上把相当于原来高级社的生产队联系在一个统一的机体之内，否则各个生产队还是各自独立的，公社化前后就没有什么根本的区别了。因此可以说，公社所有制是公社组织存在的基本条件，没有公社所有制，就没有人民公社。右倾机会主义分子不顾公社所有制客观存在的事实及由此而产生的一切变化，认为人民公社与高级社没有什么区别，是完全没有根据的。
    公社所有制虽然产生的时间还不久，今天在人民公社实行的三级所有制中，它还只是部分的，但是由于它是一种新生的事物，它在目前已经表现出无限的生命力，将来它更加有着伟大的发展前途。
    由于公社所有制对生产队所有制的巨大促进作用，由于生产队搞好生产离不开社办企业、社办事业的支持，便使生产队所有制和公社所有制结成了不可分割的联系；每一个生产队的生产搞得好不好，又会影响公社的积累，从而影响其他生产队的经济利益，因此通过公社所有制，就把各生产队联成一个整体，公社化以后，各生产队所有制虽然是基本的，但它已经与高级社不同。为了人尽其材、地尽其利、物尽其用，更好地促进社办企业、社办事业和生产队的农副业生产的发展，生产队在生产上必须服从公社的统一筹划，分配方案也必须由公社决定，公社有义务在经济上帮助各个生产队，也有权利从生产队提取公共积累，因此生产队便由经济上完全独立的高级社，变成既独立又不独立，它已经成为人民公社的一个组成部分。所有这些都使公社一级领导与过去的乡一级领导大大不同，它不但可以进行政治思想领导，而且有了经济力量，它比过去更有可能根据党的政策和国家计划组织生产和确定分配。
    公社所有制大大促进了生产队所有制，而生产队所有制发展的结果，也反过来促进了公社所有制本身的日益壮大。一者，社办企业、社办事业在促进生产队经济发展的过程中发展了；再者，生产队经济上升，又给公社提供了更多的积累。因此目前一定要在承认基本的生产队所有制的条件下，积极发展社办企业、社办事业。这是巩固与发展人民公社和促进农村生产大跃进的一个重要环节；也是将来实现向全民所有制过渡的必要条件。（摘自10月14日“解放日报”汪家千：“部分公社所有制的巨大作用”）
