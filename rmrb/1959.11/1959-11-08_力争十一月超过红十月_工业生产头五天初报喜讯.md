Xinhua News Agency, 7th: In the first five days of November, the capital's industrial system workers exceeded the total output value plan by 2.9%, and the total output value increased by 4.4% compared with the same period last month. In these five days, the city's average daily output of pig iron increased by 3.2% compared with late October, the output of raw coal reached 54.5% of the ten-day plan, and the plans for cement, cotton cloth, and cotton yarn were also overfulfilled.

Entering November, the mass-based technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Beijing's factories and mines has been more widely and deeply developed, and the level of production has continued to rise. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company carried out technical demonstrations and "one-dragon" cooperation competitions, and pig iron, steel, and steel products all completed or exceeded production plans. The average daily output of pig iron and steel both increased compared to late October. The average daily output of Beijing Special Steel Plant in the first five days increased by 9.2% compared with late October. The North China Radio Equipment Factory launched a mass movement of "Everyone Contributes Treasures, Everyone Learns from Experience," and a large number of technical innovation groups and advanced experience promotion stations appeared. The third branch alone organized forty-three advanced experience promotion teams, making advanced experiences blossom everywhere. The factory's production increased day by day, and the daily plan was overfulfilled for five days. The state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory vigorously promoted the "Advanced Operation Method of Operation and Maintenance" created by Qingdao textile workers, and the factory's output value, output, and quality all fully completed the plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 7th: The thirteen rolling mills of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have achieved new victories with greater, faster, better, and more economical results in the first five days of November. From the 1st to the 5th, Anshan Iron and Steel's steel production exceeded the state plan by 3.8%; the first-class product rate of steel exceeded the state plan, reaching 91.31%; product costs gradually decreased; and accidents were greatly reduced.

At the beginning of the month, the workers of each rolling mill summarized and evaluated the great achievements of the activities to present gifts to the National Conference of Heroes in October. They decided to continue to oppose right-leaning ideas, boost morale, and deeply carry out technical demonstration competitions with high output, high quality, low cost, and safe production as the content, and resolutely produce more and better steel products to once again present gifts to the National Conference of Heroes. In the summary and evaluation, the workers of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant selected more than 1,600 advanced pacesetters, setting learning models for the workers and greatly inspiring their enthusiasm and creativity. In order to ensure product quality, they also held an exhibition to improve quality and carried out excellent quality inspector competitions, etc., so that the output of seamless steel tubes in the first five days exceeded the plan by 167 tons, and the first-class product rate of seamless steel tubes exceeded the plan by 2.76%. In the performance competition, the workers of the Large Rolling Mill organized production workers and quality inspectors to combine and jointly study methods for rolling more and better, so that the steel output exceeded the plan by 1,065 tons, and the first-class product rate of steel also exceeded the state plan by 0.7%.

In the performance competition, the workers of each rolling mill tried every means to reduce product costs and reduce accidents to ensure safe production. The No. 1 Medium Plate Mill launched a mass safety inspection campaign, strengthened various safety measures, so that in the first five days, not only the output and quality of steel plates exceeded the state plan, but also accidents were greatly reduced, and production was very safe. Some factories have actively reduced waste in the steel rolling process, so that product costs have gradually decreased.

After several days of preparation, the workers of these thirteen rolling mills launched a larger-scale joint technical performance competition period starting from the 6th, striving for a full victory in November with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 7th: The production level of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company at the beginning of this month exceeded the end of last month. From November 1st to 5th, the average daily output of steel increased by 20.36% compared with the same period last month, and increased by 10.85% compared with the last five days of last month; the average daily output of steel products increased by 34.6% compared with last month, and increased by 3.71% compared with the last five days of last month.

The instruction issued by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on the evening of October 31 on "Fighting Hard in November, Breaking Through Weak Links, and Ensuring the Comprehensive Completion and Overfulfillment of the National Production Plan" greatly encouraged all workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company. Each furnace and team conscientiously discussed the November production plan, identified weak links affecting production, and made great efforts in technical innovation and technical revolution, ensuring continuous high production. In terms of steelmaking, short furnace life, untimely supply of molten iron, low gas temperature, and slow demolding after the furnace are major weak links. The company organized model technical performance groups to promote the advanced experience of steel casting and iron melting furnaces to various furnaces. The small open-hearth furnace workshop vigorously promoted advanced experience to address weak links, and created 400 new records continuously in the first four days of November. For five days, each shift and each furnace exceeded the production plan. The average utilization coefficient of the furnace reached 15, approaching the national advanced level, and the quality of steel was also fully qualified. The workers of No. 3 furnace of the large open-hearth furnace plant—the national medium-sized open-hearth red banner furnace—quickly dried the newly overhauled furnace, and created a new smelting record of 7 minutes and 55 seconds in the third furnace of steelmaking after the furnace was opened, breaking the routine that production could only be normal after seven or eight furnaces were opened, and shortening the smelting time to 7 minutes and 24 seconds.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 7th: Tangshan Steel Plant achieved a comprehensive victory in the first five days of November.

In these five days, the plant produced 2,511 tons more steel ingots and 1,017 tons more steel than the state plan; the qualified rate of steel ingots reached 99.49%, and the qualified rate of steel products reached 99.94%; the consumption of pig iron per ton of steel was reduced by 17.13 kilograms compared to the original savings target. Among them, the pig iron consumption of the No. 1 Steelmaking Workshop was reduced to 1,245.67 kilograms, reaching the national advanced level.

Since November, under the slogan of "Surpass October in November, Offer a Generous Gift to the National Conference of Heroes," the plant's workers have launched technical performance competitions focusing on key production points. The No. 1 Steelmaking Workshop universally improved the workers' operating skills through performance competitions such as fast operation of good steelmaking, which further stimulated the workers' enthusiasm and made the steel output and quality jump again and again, and the pig iron consumption was significantly reduced. The rolling mill also created a new record of steel rolling after organizing a fast steel rolling performance.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 7th: The average daily output value of Tianjin's paper industry in the first five days of November increased by 1.5% compared with the average daily output value in late October, the average daily output of paper and cardboard increased by 7.9%, and the paper formation rate of main varieties such as embossed printing paper and glazed paper reached more than 98%.

The average daily output value of Tianjin's paper industry rose step by step in October, with the middle ten days increasing by 23.6% compared with the first ten days, and the last ten days increasing by 28.7% compared with the middle ten days. At the beginning of November, the workers of each paper mill launched a high-yield competition of "No Reduction at the Beginning of the Month, No Rushing at the End of the Month, Look at the First Ten Days for the Whole Month, and the First Ten Days Exceed Thirty-Three (33% of the monthly plan)." Since each factory had handed down the November production plan to the workshop team at the end of October, mobilized the workers to discuss it, so that everyone clearly knew the tasks to be completed by their team and even each machine, and formulated specific measures. Each production team of the First People's Paper Mill adopted the method of calculating every hour and comparing every two hours, and everyone strived to be the best. On the 1st, they created a new record of 129 tons per day, a sharp increase of 57% compared with the average daily output in late October. The Guanghua Paper Mill sent people to Shanghai in mid-October to learn more than a dozen advanced experiences and promoted them throughout the factory. After promoting advanced experiences such as increasing the speed and air volume of the exhaust fan on the 25th and 26th paper machines, the average daily output in recent days has increased by more than 0.7 tons compared with the average in late October.
