    Firing Porcelain with Coal Gas
    Since the beginning of this year, under the leadership of the Party Committee and with the assistance of the Ministry of Light Industry, the Zibo Porcelain Factory has successfully experimented with firing fine porcelain using coal gas made from low-quality coal. This is a major achievement in technological innovation for ceramic factories. Firing kilns with coal gas has six major advantages: First, it can save 40%-50% of coal; second, it shortens firing time and accelerates kiln turnover. Firing coal kilns requires 48 hours, while firing coal gas kilns only requires 24 hours; third, it improves product quality, with a finished product rate of over 90%; fourth, it avoids high-temperature operations and improves labor and hygiene conditions; fifth, the technology is easy to master, facilitating the training of technical personnel. For example, to become a relatively skilled firing worker, learning to fire coal kilns generally takes five to six years, while learning to fire coal gas kilns only takes two months to half a year; sixth, it can utilize large quantities of low-quality coal or anthracite. We now plan to gasify 50% of our kilns by the end of this year and achieve full gasification next year. After full implementation, we will save 6,717 tons of coal annually. Due to the shortened firing time, we will increase the number of kiln firings by 222, increasing production by 3,796,200 pieces, increasing output value by 526,440 yuan, and increasing profits by 400,486.60 yuan. We will achieve significant results in product quality.

    用煤气烧瓷
    今年以来，淄博瓷厂职工在党委的领导下，在轻工业部的帮助下，试验成功了用劣质煤煤气烧细瓷。这是陶瓷厂在技术革新方面的一个重大成就。用煤气烧窑有六大优点：第一，可以节省煤炭40％—50％；第二，缩短烧成时间，加速窑次周转，烧煤窑需四十八小时，烧煤气窑需二十四小时即可；第三，提高产品质量，成品率达到90％以上；第四，避免高温作业，改善劳动条件和卫生条件；第五，技术容易掌握，便于培养技术力量，如要成一个较熟练的烧成工人，学烧煤窑一般的需要五至六年的时间，而学烧煤气窑，有两个月到半年的时间即可；第六，可以大量的使用劣质煤、或无烟煤。现在，我们计划今年年底实现50％的窑炉煤气化，明年全部煤气化。这样全面推广后，每年能节约煤炭六千七百一十七吨。由于缩短了烧成时间，增加了二百二十二个窑次，增产三百七十九万六千二百件，增加产值五十二万六千四百四十元，增加利润四十万零四千八百六十六元。在产品质量方面，将获得显著效果。
