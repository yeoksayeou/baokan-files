Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: The National "Heroes' Conference" Metallurgical System Experience Exchange Meeting concluded today. At today's meeting, all delegates unanimously passed a proposal calling on metallurgical workers across the country to comprehensively and over-fulfill this year's production and construction tasks of the metallurgical industry in a more, faster, better, and more economical manner. They also pledged to ensure a "red start," "monthly red," and "completely red" production and construction performance in 1960, achieving a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward.

To ensure the completion of the above tasks, based on the results of several days of experience exchange, the delegates emphasized the need to continue to unswervingly implement the Party's "walking on two legs" policy in the metallurgical industry. While developing the "large foreign groups," the "small foreign groups" should be further developed and improved. Adhere to putting politics in command and launching mass movements, and earnestly promote the new form of mass movement led by Anshan Iron and Steel Company—carrying out one-dragon collaborative competitions and large-scale technical performance competitions. In all aspects of the metallurgical industry, especially in the currently weak sectors such as steel rolling, geology and mining, non-ferrous metals, coking, and refractory materials, earnestly promote the various advanced experiences exchanged and summarized at this meeting to ensure a comprehensive leap forward in the entire metallurgical industry.

At this meeting, representatives from Wuhu Prefecture, an advanced collective that achieved large-scale high yields from small blast furnaces, and dozens of representatives from red flag small blast furnaces, small converters, indigenous copper smelters, small aluminum plants, and simple coking ovens from places such as Ma'anshan, Sichuan, Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, and Qilian Mountains, respectively introduced the experiences of various small and medium-sized metallurgical enterprises in achieving high yields, high quality, and low costs. Their experiences vividly demonstrate that small and medium-sized enterprises in various regions not only have fast construction and low investment, but also rapidly improve their production technology level after a short period of rectification and consolidation, proving that small and medium-sized enterprises have unlimited vitality. For example, the ninety-eight small blast furnaces built in Wuhu Prefecture at the end of last year currently have an average utilization coefficient of over 1.9, with half of the small blast furnaces reaching 2 to 3. This year, Wuhu Prefecture can not only complete the annual pig iron production plan 70% ahead of schedule, but also continuously improve quality and reduce costs. After extensive and in-depth experience exchanges and mutual supplementation among representatives from various regions, this meeting has summarized the experience of ensuring high yield, high quality, and low cost of small blast furnaces and small converters into twelve specific measures. Other small and medium-sized enterprises in non-ferrous metals, such as small copper concentrators, small aluminum plants, and indigenous copper smelters, have also summarized their experiences according to different situations. The delegates also included these experiences in the proposal, urging workers in various regions to promote them and further promote the high-speed development of the metallurgical industry.

According to the introduction of representatives from Anshan Iron and Steel Company at this meeting, after Anshan Iron and Steel Company widely carried out one-dragon large-scale collaborative competitions and large-scale technical performance competitions, dozens of factories and mines and hundreds of thousands of employees mutually supported and coordinated their actions under a unified goal and unified command. The phenomenon of disjointedness between various departments, links, and types of work was greatly changed. A comprehensive leap forward situation full of joy and enthusiasm emerged throughout the company, and production levels in all aspects continued to improve. Workers praised this situation, saying: "Everywhere is a gathering of Zhuge Liangs, a chorus of leaps forward, everyone is performing, and the whole furnace is completely red." After discussion, this meeting believed that Anshan Iron and Steel Company's approach is a new form of mass movement that has emerged in the continued leap forward this year, and is particularly adapted to the needs of large-scale combined enterprises with continuous production. Therefore, the meeting hoped that various regions would earnestly promote it and continuously enrich and develop this new method of leading mass movements in the promotion process.

During the several days of the meeting, all delegates also exchanged more than 330 specific advanced experiences according to different professions and types of work. In the process of exchange, a combination of large, medium, and small meetings was adopted, and on-site visits and operation performances were organized, so that the experience exchange was specific, detailed, lively, and vigorous. These experiences, after refinement, were also summarized in the proposal, requiring workers in the metallurgical system in various regions to promote them. These experiences include multiple fast rolling in steel rolling, rapid tunneling and rapid stripping in mining, and improving smelting intensity, improving equipment utilization, improving metal recovery rates, and improving product quality in non-ferrous metal smelting and processing.

At the conclusion of this meeting, Lu Dong, Vice Minister of Metallurgical Industry, spoke at the meeting, reporting to all delegates on the current excellent situation of the metallurgical industry and future tasks.

    冶金英雄冶炼出先进经验三百多条
    倡议各地加以推广把生产提高到更高水平
    新华社7日讯　全国“群英会”冶金系统经验交流会今天结束。全体代表在今天的会上一致通过倡议书，号召全国冶金职工更多更快更好更省地全面超额完成冶金工业今年的生产建设任务，并且保证做到明年生产建设的“开门红”、“月月红”、“满堂红”，实现1960年更好更全面的继续跃进。
    为了保证完成上述任务，代表们根据几天来经验交流的结果，着重提出在冶金工业方面要继续坚持不懈地贯彻党的两条腿走路的方针，在发展“大洋群”的同时，继续发展和提高“小洋群”；坚持政治挂帅和大搞群众运动，认真推广鞍山钢铁公司领导群众运动的新形式——开展一条龙协作竞赛和大搞技术表演赛；在冶金工业的各个方面，特别是在轧钢、地质矿山、有色金属、炼焦、耐火材料等目前冶金工业的薄弱部门，认真推广这次会上交流和总结的各项先进经验，以保证整个冶金工业全面跃进。
    在这次会议上，获得小高炉大面积丰产的先进集体芜湖专区代表和来自马鞍山、四川、石家庄、郑州、祁连山等地的红旗小高炉、小转炉、土法炼铜厂、小铝厂、简易炼焦炉等先进集体的几十位代表，分别介绍了各类中小冶金企业取得高产、优质、低成本的经验。他们的经验，生动地表明各地中小企业不仅建设快、投资少，而且经过短期的整顿和巩固，生产技术水平迅速提高，证明中小企业具有无限的生命力。譬如芜湖专区去年底建成的九十八座小高炉，目前利用系数平均达到一点九以上，其中半数小高炉达到二到三，今年芜湖专区不仅可以提前超额70％完成全年生铁产量计划，并且质量不断提高，成本不断降低。经过各地代表在广泛深入的经验交流中互相补充，这次会议已经把保证小高炉和小转炉高产、优质、低成本的经验分别总结为十二条具体措施。其他在小型铜选厂、小铝厂和土法炼铜厂等有色金属的中小企业方面，也根据不同情况，把他们的经验作了总结。代表们并且把这些经验列入倡议书，要求各地职工加以推广，进一步促进冶金工业的高速度发展。
    据鞍山钢铁公司代表在这次会上的介绍，鞍钢广泛开展一条龙大协作竞赛和大搞技术表演赛之后，几十个厂矿、十几万职工在统一目标、统一指挥下互相支援、协同动作、各部门、各个环节、各工种之间互不衔接的现象大大改变，全公司出现到处喜气洋洋、热气腾腾的全面跃进局面，各方面的生产水平都不断提高。职工们赞扬这种情况说：“到处诸葛会，一片跃进声，人人搞表演，全炉满堂红。”经过讨论，这次会议认为，鞍钢的做法是今年继续跃进中出现的大搞群众运动的新形式，并且特别适应连续生产的大型联合企业的需要。因此，会议希望各地认真推广，并在推广中不断丰富和发展这一领导群众运动的新方法。
    在几天的会议期间，全体代表还按照不同专业、不同工种，分别交流了三百三十多种具体的先进经验。在交流过程中，采取了大、中、小会议相结合的形式，并且组织了实地参观和操作表演，因而使经验交流具体细致，生动活泼。这些经验经过提炼也都归纳在倡议书中，要求各地冶金系统职工加以推广。这些经验包括轧钢方面的多条快轧，矿山方面的快速掘进、快速剥离，有色金属冶炼和加工方面的提高冶炼强度、提高设备利用率、提高金属回收率和产品质量等。
    在这次会议结束时，冶金部副部长吕东在会上讲话，向全体代表报告了当前冶金工业的大好形势和今后的任务。
