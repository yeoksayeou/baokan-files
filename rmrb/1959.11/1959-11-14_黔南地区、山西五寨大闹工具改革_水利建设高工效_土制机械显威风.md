According to the Guizhou Daily, Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture is launching a high-efficiency movement in winter water conservancy construction. The 10,702 large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects already started throughout the prefecture are widely promoting the use of various high-efficiency tools, creating a record of an average daily work efficiency of three cubic meters of earthwork and 1.9 cubic meters of stonework per person, which is nearly doubled compared to the average daily work efficiency of 1.5 cubic meters of earthwork per person last year.

The Autonomous Prefecture plans to complete water conservancy projects with a storage capacity of 500 million cubic meters in the next three months or so. With a large task and short time, all localities have focused on tool reform from the beginning. According to statistics, more than 50,000 pieces of tools such as earthen trains, pulleys, slides, dam compactors, and handcarts are being used throughout the prefecture. Among them, 250 key water conservancy projects under construction (accounting for 86.8% of the total key projects) have implemented local mechanization in several major processes such as excavation, transportation, compaction, and unloading. In order to promote the development of the high-efficiency movement, various localities have adopted many measures to carry out technological innovation and reform tools. Wangmo, Guiding, Duyun, and Dushan counties have implemented the return of five artisans (iron, wood, stone, bamboo, and mechanical artisans) to form more than 500 construction site factories, manufacturing more than 4,000 tools such as wooden rail cars, chicken carts, slides, and dam compactors. Among them, Wangmo County has promoted the use of local cranes, wooden rollers, stone rollers, tampers, and other tools, reaching more than 1,500 pieces, and the work efficiency has increased from the original average of 1.5 cubic meters of earthwork per person per day to three cubic meters. Guiding, Dushan, and other counties have also organized technical teams composed of cadres, technicians, and the masses on the construction sites, effectively promoting tool innovation.

In addition, various localities have also organized red flag competitions, encouraging the masses to reform tools and carry out technological innovation by learning from pacesetters, catching up with pacesetters, and setting up battle stages.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th - Wuzhai County, Shanxi Province, is vigorously carrying out tool innovation in water conservancy construction. From mid-October to now, the county has repaired, modified, and newly manufactured 18 types of vehicles, including wheelbarrows, two-wheeled carts, light wooden rail dump trucks, and "climbing tiger" carts, totaling 4,251 vehicles. Together with the existing 6,000 vehicles, the county now has more than 10,000 vehicles of various types. At present, heavy work such as long-distance transportation of soil, stones, and materials on water conservancy construction sites is basically done using vehicles. Work efficiency has generally increased by more than two times.

This year, Wuzhai County has a large task and a small labor force in water conservancy construction. The county plans to cultivate 240,000 mu of watered land, control soil erosion area of 1 million mu, build 100,000 mu of terraced fields, two medium-sized reservoirs, 360 small reservoirs, 11 hydroelectric power stations, dig 190 wells, and build 1,280 large, medium, and small canals. These projects require more than 18 million workdays, an increase of three to seven times compared to last year. In order to improve work efficiency, the Wuzhai County Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the people of the county to work hard for a month to manufacture 10,000 vehicles. Hundreds of carpenters and blacksmiths went deep into various management areas to provide technical guidance, and the county quickly restored and newly built 110 repair and assembly plants and 96 repair and assembly groups, working day and night to rush to make vehicles. The members of the Yijing Management Area of the Yijing Commune used old iron and old wood to repair and manufacture 240 vehicles in seven days. More than 100 members of the Nanfeng Reservoir construction team worked hard for seven days to produce more than 80,000 parts of nine types, including vehicles, flower caps, bead bowls, bead plates, and ball bearings, and quickly repaired more than 800 vehicles of various types, which increased the soil transportation efficiency by two and a half times and greatly accelerated the progress of the project.

    黔南地区、山西五寨大闹工具改革
    水利建设高工效  土制机械显威风
    据贵州日报消息　黔南布依族苗族自治州各地在冬修水利中，开展高工效运动。全州已经开工的一万零七百零二处大、中、小型水利工程，广泛地推行使用各种高工效工具，创造了平均每人每日工效土方三方、石方一点九方的纪录，比去年平均每人每日工效土方一点五方提高了近一倍。
    自治州计划在最近三个月左右修好引蓄水量五亿方的水利工程，任务大、时间短，因此，各地一开始就狠抓工具改革工作。据统计，全州使用土火车、滑丝、滑板、压坝机、手推车等工具达五万多件。其中动工的二百五十个水利骨干工程（占总骨干工程的86.8％），在挖、运、压、卸等几个主要工序上，实行了土机械化。为了推动高工效运动的开展，各地采取了许多办法，大闹技术革新，改革工具。望谟、贵定、都匀、独山四县，实行五匠
  （铁、木、石、竹和机械方面的工匠）归队，办起了工地工厂五百多个，制造了木轨车、鸡公车、滑头、滑板、压坝机等工具四千多件，其中望谟县推广使用土起重机、木磙、石磙、打夯机等工具已达一千五百多件，工效由原来平均每人每日土方一点五方提高到三方。贵定、独山等县，还在工地上组织了有干部、技术员、群众参加的技术小组，有效地推动工具革新工作。
    此外，各地还组织红旗竞赛，通过学标兵，赶标兵等形式，大摆擂台，鼓励群众改革工具，大闹技术革新。
    新华社太原12日电　山西省五寨县在兴修水利中大闹工具革新，从10月中旬到现在，全县已修整、改制、新制成独轮车、双轮车、轻便木轨斗车、爬山虎车等各种车子十八种、共四千二百五十一辆。连同原有的六千多辆，全县已有各种车子一万多辆。目前，水利工地上远距离拉运土、石、器材等重活，基本上都已使用车子。工效一般提高两倍以上。
    今年，五寨县兴修水利的任务大，劳力少。全县计划修水地二十四万亩，控制水土流失面积一百万亩，修梯田十万亩，中型水库两个，小型水库三百六十个，水电站十一处，打井一百九十眼，大、中、小渠道一千二百八十条。这些工程需要一千八百余万个劳动日，比去年增加了三倍到七倍。为了提高工效，中共五寨县委号召全县人民苦战一个月，修造车子一万辆。几百名木匠和铁匠分别深入各管理区进行技术指导，全县迅速恢复和新建起一百一十个修配厂和九十六个修配组，日夜轮班赶制车子。义井公社义井管理区的社员们用旧铁、旧木料七天内便修造车子二百四十辆。修建南峰水库的一百多社员苦战七天，制出车辆、花帽、珠碗、盘珠、滚珠等九种零件共八万多件，很快就整修起各种车子八百多辆，使运土效率提高了两倍半，大大加快了工程进度。
