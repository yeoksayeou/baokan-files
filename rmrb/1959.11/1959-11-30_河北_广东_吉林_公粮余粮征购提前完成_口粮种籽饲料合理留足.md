Hebei, Guangdong, and Jilin
Grain and Surplus Grain Procurement Completed Ahead of Schedule; Ration Grain, Seeds, and Feed Adequately Retained
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: Hebei Province has completed this year's grain procurement and sesame purchase tasks. The purchase of cotton and other agricultural and sideline products is being intensified.

Hebei Province has achieved a bumper harvest of grain, cotton, and sesame this year. Party committees and government departments at all levels made full preparations ideologically and organizationally before the procurement work began. After the grain and oil crops were on the market, the procurement work was launched, and pacesetters were established to initiate competitions. Handan Prefecture completed the annual procurement task ahead of schedule by October 15. Subsequently, all parts of the province put forward the slogan "Learn from Handan, Catch up with Handan," which also accelerated the progress of grain procurement. Xinle County in Shijiazhuang Prefecture completed the grain procurement task in one go on September 28. All counties in the district immediately launched a wave of learning from Xinle and catching up with Xinle. Zhengding County rushed to deliver grain for several days, and also overfulfilled the grain procurement task by the end of September.

All localities have rationally retained sufficient ration grain, seeds, feed grain, and oil crops for their own use according to standards. Many communes and production teams are carefully calculating their accounts, preparing to continue selling the remaining oil crops beyond seeds and oil crops for their own use to the state. After calculation, Yangqiao People's Commune and Zhai Production Team in Daming County sold an additional 1,230 jin of oil crops to the state beyond the plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: Guangdong Province has overfulfilled this year's grain procurement task by 2.08% on the 21st of this month; the grain stored in warehouses has been inspected and is generally clean, full, and meets national standards.

After the autumn grain harvest in Guangdong Province, people's communes everywhere are filled with the scene of "celebrating the bumper harvest and actively selling more grain." Commune members of Houjie Commune in Dongguan County believe that this year's late rice harvest is the result of the Party leading them to build water conservancy projects, deeply plow the land, improve the soil, and promote improved varieties. Remembering the source while drinking water, they should actively sell surplus grain to support national construction. The entire commune mobilized more than 10,000 people, concentrated all transportation tools, and completed the grain sales plan in two days. On the evening of completing the plan, the commune members calculated another account: in addition to leaving enough ration grain, feed grain, seed grain, and reserve grain, there was still a lot of grain. Therefore, they sold another 1.05 million jin of grain to the state. Heliao and Donghe brigades of Heshan Commune in Liangyang County were once well-known poor brigades, with very low yields due to annual droughts. After the establishment of the commune, a large amount of fertilizer and seeds were allocated to support these two brigades; at the same time, due to the organization of large-scale cooperation, the Nalong River water conservancy project was built, eliminating the historical drought, and as a result, both brigades achieved a bumper harvest this year. The commune members of the two brigades said: Without the Party and without the commune, there would be no bumper harvest this year. Therefore, they completed the plan to sell surplus grain within a few days.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun: The people's communes in Jilin Province, which have achieved agricultural bumper harvests, have completed this year's national grain procurement plan ahead of schedule on November 22, while rationally retaining sufficient ration grain, seeds, and feed.

Jilin Province had a lot of autumn rain this year, and the grain moisture content was high. When transporting grain into warehouses, people's communes at all levels tried every means to improve the quality of the grain. People's communes in the suburbs of Liaoyuan City adopted methods such as changing large stacks into small stacks (to facilitate ventilation), expanding drying grounds, and using fire kang and tobacco curing rooms to dry the grain. After drying 18,000 tons of high-moisture grain, they were sent to the state granaries. The staff and residents of the towns and cities also actively helped the communes to dry grain. At present, more than 95% of the grain stored in warehouses throughout the province is dried, winnowed, and has full grains of medium and high quality.

At present, all parts of Jilin Province are continuing to exert their efforts, strengthen grain collection, transportation, and storage work. (Attached picture)

    公粮余粮征购提前完成  口粮种籽饲料合理留足
    新华社天津电河北省已经完成了今年度的粮食征购和芝麻收购任务。棉花和其他农副产品的收购工作正在加紧进行。
    河北省今年的粮食、棉花和芝麻都获得丰收。各地党委和政府部门在收购工作开始以前，从思想上、组织工作上作了充分准备。在粮食、油料登场以后，就展开了收购工作，并且树立标兵，发起竞赛。邯郸地区到10月15日就提前完成了全年征购任务。接着，全省各地提出“学邯郸、赶邯郸”的口号，也加速了粮食征购的进度。石家庄地区的新乐县一鼓作气在9月28日完成了粮食征购任务，全区各县马上掀起学新乐、赶新乐的热潮，正定县连日突击交售，9月底也超额完成了粮食征购任务。
    各地都按标准，合理留足了口粮、种籽、饲料粮和自用油料。很多公社和生产队正在算细账，准备将种籽和自用油料以外的剩余油料，继续交售给国家。大名县扬桥人民公社和寨生产队经过算账，在计划以外多卖了一千二百三十斤油料给国家。
    据新华社广州电　广东省今年度的粮食征购任务，已在本月21日超额2.08％完成；入库的粮食经过检验，一般都干净、饱满，符合国家规定标准。
    广东省在秋粮收获后，各地人民公社充满着“喜庆大丰收，积极多卖粮”的景象。东莞县后街公社社员们都认为今年的晚稻丰收，是党领导他们大修水利，深翻土地，改良土壤和推广良种的结果，饮水思源，应该踊跃卖余粮支援国家建设。全社出动一万多人，集中了所有的运输工具，突击两天完成了售粮计划。在完成计划当晚，社员们又算了一笔账：除留下足够的口粮、饲料粮、种籽粮和储备粮以外，还有很多粮食。于是，又卖给国家一百零五万斤粮食。两阳县合山公社的合寮、东河两个大队，过去都是有名的穷队，由于年年受旱，产量很低。公社成立后，拨出了大批肥料、种籽支援这两个大队；同时由于组织大协作，修建了那龙河水利工程，消灭了历史性的旱灾，结果这两个队今年都获得丰收。两队的社员们说：没有党，没有公社，就没有今年的丰收。因而在几天内就完成了出售余粮的计划。
    据新华社长春电  获得农业丰收的吉林省各人民公社在合理留足口粮、种籽饲料的同时，提前在11月22日完成了今年度的国家粮食征购计划。
    吉林省今年秋雨多，粮食水分高。各地人民公社在运送粮食入库时，千方百计提高粮食质量。辽源市郊的人民公社采取改大垛为小垛（便于通风）、扩大晒谷场、利用火炕和烤烟房烘干等办法，把一万八千吨高水分粮食晒干后，才送交国家粮库。城镇的职工和居民也积极帮助公社晒粮。目前全省入库的粮食中，95％以上是晒干、扬净、籽粒饱满的中、上等粮。
    目前，吉林省各地正在继续鼓足干劲，加强粮食集运和保管工作。（附图片）
