The leaves are beginning to wither. The peaks of the high mountains are already covered with the first snow. Albania and the nature along the Adriatic coast have put on their autumn clothes. But spring is active in the hearts of every Albanian. In these days, our people are ecstatic. We are celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of our motherland's liberation from foreign robbers and domestic enemies. We are celebrating this great festival with enormous achievements, achievements that were unimaginable even in dreams in the painful past.

Albania is a country rich in resources and with a pleasant climate. It abounds in grains, cotton, tobacco, rice, citrus fruits, and a variety of fruits. But our country used to be a backward agricultural country. Agriculture and various sectors of the national economy were in a very primitive state. It is enough to mention that there was not even a single tractor for farmers to use before liberation. At that time, there was not even an agricultural institution, and there were only eighty-six agricultural experts with higher education degrees in the whole country. The peasants suffered from the cruel oppression of domestic nobles and foreign robbers.

However, the victory of the people's revolution ended the poverty and suffering of the peasants. The system of feudal lords, nobles, and landlords was completely overthrown. The working people in the countryside saw the light.

Our Party, loyal to the immortal principles of Marxism-Leninism, immediately took a series of important measures to liberate the peasants from generations of oppression and exploitation, eliminate the old relationships in land ownership, and put our countryside and agriculture on the road to socialism and modernization. The land reform carried out in a revolutionary way made the peasants the masters of the land, restricted the exploitation of man by man, eliminated the remnants of feudal relations, and opened up a bright and glorious future.

If the Party and the government had only been satisfied with distributing the land to the peasants, could our agriculture have developed? If our fields were still divided into small plots by small ditches and fences, and still cultivated with wooden plows, could our agriculture have developed? Of course not. Therefore, it was necessary to implement the collectivization of agriculture, so that tractors could run unhindered and economic planning could be carried out. Today, on the fifteenth anniversary of our country's liberation, our peasants have firmly embarked on the road of cooperation. There are now 1,845 agricultural production cooperatives in the country, including 69.6% of the nation's farming households and 81.5% of the cultivated land. Most of the cooperatives have embarked on the road to prosperity. This can be clearly seen from the income and remuneration of labor days of the peasants, the newly built houses, electric lighting, clothing, and the entire environment of rural residences.

But more importantly, the cooperative system has now become the main base for agricultural products. For example, last year the cotton sold by the cooperatives accounted for 89% of the country's total, sugar beets accounted for about 70%, and tobacco accounted for 68.8%.

However, the achievements made in fifteen years are not only limited to the socialist transformation of agriculture. Good results have also been achieved in the modernization of agriculture and the establishment of a modern material and technical basis for agricultural production. In the past, many of our farmers had never even heard the word "tractor." Even in the early years after liberation, the number of tractors was very limited. I remember an incident in 1946, when members of the Krutje agricultural cooperative said at a meeting: "We must do everything possible to get a tractor for our cooperative! With this tractor, we can move forward faster..." At that time, the peasants of Krutje Village in Lushnjë District only dreamed of having a tractor, but now we have more than 3,500 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), hundreds of seeders, harvesters, cultivators and other agricultural implements throughout the country. Now 70% of the main agricultural production processes in our country have been mechanized. The degree of agricultural mechanization in our country is higher than that of neighboring Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey, even though our agriculture was very backward in the past, while these countries had more advanced agriculture before the war. This is certainly a great achievement. But the achievements in soil improvement and the construction of irrigation canal networks are even greater. The singing of frogs is no longer heard in our fields. For the first time, the generations-old croaking of frogs is not heard in the Maliq swamp area and the Korçë region. Today, sugar beets, grains and other crops grow on this plain. This is not limited to Maliq. After the transformation of Maliq, it was the turn of Tërbuf, Thumana, Urgu, Raskovec and all the barren plains in the country.

The soil improvement of fields is a major event undertaken by the people's government. The fact that 14,000 hectares of land have been obtained and 67,750 hectares of land have been improved due to soil improvement is indeed a very big thing for our country. Therefore, today the irrigated area of ​​Albanian land is 1.5 times larger than in 1938, and the sown area has almost doubled.

The achievements made in the socialist transformation and mechanization of agriculture have made our agriculture, in addition to expanding in scale, also become an increasingly intensive agriculture, thereby providing high-quality raw materials for our young industry, such as cotton, tobacco, sugar beets, fruits, etc. The yield of national crops has been greatly improved. For example, although the climatic conditions were not good last year, the yield of wheat per hectare was still 88% more than in 1938, and corn was 27% more. This year's crop yields have increased again. Therefore, in the past fifteen years, the achievements of agriculture in our country have been comprehensive.

In every sector of agriculture and animal husbandry, there have been many new and significant changes that are incomparable to the past. For example, before liberation, animal husbandry was a very important sector in our national economy, but what did we get from cattle and sheep? The milk yield was so low that it could hardly compare with any country. What we got from the sheep was coarse and hard wool. But today the situation of animal husbandry has changed. Despite the losses caused by the war, the total number of livestock has exceeded that of 1938 to a considerable extent, and significant achievements have been made in pig breeding. In recent years, our Party and government have taken a series of major measures to rapidly increase the production of meat and milk. A lot of work has been done and is being done in improving livestock breeds by artificial insemination and ensuring a good feed base. According to the resolution of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party in November 1958, by 1965 the per capita output of meat and milk will be doubled compared with 1957.

Our friends and ourselves often say that Albania will become a garden blooming with hundreds of flowers. This statement is not just symbolic. Albania has now begun to transform into a colorful garden of fruits with grapes, olives, citrus and other fruit trees intertwined. It is enough to mention this point: there are now 800% more fruit trees, 206% more citrus trees, and 70% more olive trees in our country than in 1938.

All these achievements are very great for our small country. These achievements have been achieved thanks to the wise and farsighted leadership of the Labor Party, and the great assistance given to us by the glorious Soviet Union, the great China, and other countries of the socialist camp.

In a few more decades, maybe in a few years, these achievements will seem very small to us. This is just as we feel when comparing the achievements of the first five years with the achievements we have made now. (Attached picture)

    阿尔巴尼亚农业和畜牧业的发展
    阿尔巴尼亚　克里米·米沙
    树叶开始雕谢。高山之巅已复盖了第一场雪。阿尔巴尼亚和亚得里亚海沿岸的大自然已经穿上了秋装。但是，春天却活跃在每一个阿尔巴尼亚人的心头。在这些日子里，我国人民欣喜若狂。我们正在庆祝祖国从外国强盗和国内敌人手中解放出来的十五周年。我们以十分巨大的成就来庆祝这个伟大的节日，这些成就在苦痛的过去甚至做梦也没有想到。
    阿尔巴尼亚是一个资源丰富、气候宜人的国家。这里盛产粮食、棉花、烟草、大米、橘类和品种多样的水果。但是我们的国家过去却是一个落后的农业国。农业和国民经济的各部门处于非常原始的状态。只消提一下解放前连一台供农民使用的拖拉机都没有这一点就够了。那时连一个农业机构也不曾有过，全国总共才有八十六名具有高等教育程度的农业专家。农民受着国内的贵族和外国强盗们残酷的压迫。
    但是，人民革命的胜利结束了农民的贫困和苦难。封建主、贵族和地主的制度被彻底推翻了。农村的劳动人民见到了光明。
    忠于不朽的马克思列宁主义原则的我们的党，立刻采取了一系列重要的措施，使农民从世世代代的压迫和剥削中解放出来，消灭了土地方面的旧的相互关系，把我国农村和农业推上了社会主义和现代化的道路。以革命的方式进行的土地改革，使农民成了土地的主人，限制了人剥削人，消灭了封建关系的残余，为未来开辟了光辉灿烂的前程。
    如果党和政府仅满足于把土地分给农民，我们的农业能不能发展起来呢？如果我们的田地仍然是被小沟小栅分割成小块小块的土地，仍然使用木犁耕作，我们的农业能不能发展起来呢？当然不行。因此，必须实行农业的集体化，让拖拉机能够畅行无阻，让经济计划化。今天，在我国解放十五周年的时候，我们的农民已坚定不移地走上了合作化的道路。全国现在共有一千八百四十五个农业生产合作社，包括全国69.6％的农户和81.5％的耕地。大部分的合作社已经走上了富裕的道路。这从农民的收入和劳动日的报酬、新盖的房屋、电灯照明、服装和农村住宅的整个环境就可以明显地看出来。
    但是，更重要的是，合作社系统现在已成为农产品的主要基地。例如，合作社去年交售的棉花占全国的89％、糖萝卜占70％左右、烟草占68.8％。
    但是，十五年内所取得的成就还不仅只在于农业的社会主义改造。在农业的现代化方面，以及建立农业生产的现代物质技术基础方面，也取得了良好的成果。从前，我们的许多农民甚至没听说过“拖拉机”这几个字。就是在解放后的最初几年，拖拉机的数目也是屈指可数的。我记得1946年时的一桩事，克鲁蒂耶村的农业社员在一次集会上说：“咱们要想尽一切办法，使咱们的合作社有一台拖拉机才好！有了这台拖拉机，我们可以更快地前进……”当时，柳什尼区克鲁蒂耶村的农民仅仅幻想有一台拖拉机，而现在我们全国有三千五百多台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）、几百台播种机、收割机、中耕机和其他的农具。现在我国70％的主要农业生产过程业已机械化了。我国的农业机械化程度比邻国南斯拉夫、希腊、土耳其还高，尽管我国的农业过去非常落后，而这些国家战前就拥有比较先进的农业。这当然是一个很大的成就。可是在土壤改良、灌溉渠网的建设方面取得的成就还要大。在我国的田野里再也听不到青蛙的歌唱了。在马里卡沼泽地带和科尔察地区破天荒第一次听不到青蛙的世世代代的歌声。今天在这个平原上生长着糖萝卜、粮食和其他的农作物。这还不是仅仅限于马里卡。改造马里卡之后，轮到了特尔布弗、图曼、乌尔古、拉斯柯维楚以及全国所有的荒芜的平原地区。
    田地的土壤改良是人民政权办的一件大事。由于土壤改良而获得了一万四千公顷土地和改善了六万七千七百五十公顷土地，这对于我们国家来说的确是一件很大的事情。因此，今天阿尔巴尼亚土地的灌溉面积比1938年扩大了一点五倍，而播种面积差不多扩大了一倍。
    农业的社会主义改造和机械化方面所取得的成就使得我们的农业，除了规模扩大以外，并且成为集约经营日益增强的农业，从而能为我们年轻的工业提供优质的原料，如棉花、烟草、糖萝卜、水果等等。全国农作物的产量已有很大提高。例如，虽然去年气候条件不好，而每公顷收获的小麦还比1938年多88％，玉蜀黍多27％。今年农作物的产量又提高了。因此，十五年来，我国农业的成就是全面的。
    在农业的每一个部门和畜牧业方面都有许多新的、重大的变化，甚至与过去是无法相比的。例如，解放前畜牧业在我们的国民经济中曾经是一个非常重要的部门，可是从牛和羊的身上又得到了什么呢？挤奶量是如此之低，几乎比不上任何一个国家。从羊身上得到的是又粗又硬的羊毛。但是，今天畜牧业的状况变了。尽管遭到战争带来的损失，牲畜总头数已经在相当的程度上超过了1938年，猪的饲养方面获得成就特别显著。最近几年，我们党和政府采取了一系列重大措施，以便快速度地提高肉类和奶类的生产。在用人工配种的方法改良牲畜品种和保证良好的饲料基地等方面进行了并正在进行着很多工作。根据阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会1958年十一月全会的决议，到1965年按人口平均计算肉类和牛奶的产量将比1957年多一倍。
    我们的朋友和我们自己常说，阿尔巴尼亚将成为一个百花盛开的花园。这句话并不是仅仅具有象征性的意思。阿尔巴尼亚现在就已开始变成为葡萄、橄榄、柑橘等果树交相辉映万紫千红的花果园。提提这点就够了：现在我国的果树比1938年多800％，柑橘树多206％，橄榄树多70％。
    所有这些成就对于我们小小的国家来说是非常巨大的。这些成就的获得是由于劳动党的英明而高瞻远瞩的领导，由于光荣的苏联、伟大的中国和社会主义阵营其他国家给予我们巨大的援助。
    再过一些年代，可能不几年，这些成就对于我们来说将仿佛是很小的。这正如拿第一个五年的成就同现在所取得的成就相比时我们所感到的一样。（附图片）
