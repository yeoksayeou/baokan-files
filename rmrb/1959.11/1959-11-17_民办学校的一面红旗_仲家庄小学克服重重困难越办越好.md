A Red Flag for People-Run Schools
Zhongjiazhuang Elementary School Overcomes Numerous Difficulties and Improves Steadily

(Reported by our newspaper) The people-run Zhongjiazhuang Elementary School in Taozhuang Commune, Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, is gradually developing and growing stronger. Zhongjiazhuang People-Run Elementary School was founded in 1955. Initially, the school was located in a dilapidated temple, with only twenty-six students. Now it has become a fully-fledged elementary school with classrooms, dormitories, a playground, and a garden. It has five classes with nearly two hundred students. All school-age children in the brigade where the school is located are now enrolled.

In recent years, the school's teaching quality has continuously improved. This semester, the county work team held a sample test in the guidance area where the school is located. The average scores of the four grades in language and arithmetic exceeded the level of other elementary schools in the area. Students participate in physical labor within their capabilities. They have cultivated three mu of campus land and raised several pigs and sheep. From 1958 to 1959, the school's campus production value reached 880 yuan, which solved the students' expenses for books, notebooks, and part of the school's miscellaneous expenses, reducing the burden on the brigade and parents. Some graduates from this school have continued their studies, while others have become literacy teachers.

The teachers and students of Zhongjiazhuang People-Run Elementary School have a very high enthusiasm for teaching and learning. The principal, Zhong Changjun, had only studied in a private school and had no foundation in arithmetic. However, when he saw that no one was teaching arithmetic at the school, he was determined to delve into it, learning before teaching. He attended the county-run training class for teachers of people-run schools and the county teacher training school, systematically studying language and arithmetic. When he started preparing arithmetic lessons, he didn't know where to start, so he connected with teachers from nearby public elementary schools and humbly learned from their experience. He paid special attention to the combination of classroom explanation and practical application. When teaching the "units of weight" lesson, he prepared measuring tools and scales and let the children weigh things themselves in the classroom. When teaching the lesson on grain crops, he took the students to the garden to cultivate corn by hand. Under the teacher's active guidance, the students have a high learning enthusiasm. They never miss class easily, and even during the busy season, the attendance rate is above 90%.

The reason why this people-run school is doing so well is due to the care and leadership of the brigade party branch and the support of the masses. When the school was first established, some cadres and teachers pursued formality, seeking novelty and foreign things. Before the building was even there, they bought cement to build a toilet. The branch conducted education on running the school diligently and thriftily, persuading the teachers to sell the cement to buy glass and build classrooms first. The toilet was built with old wood and broken earthenware jars without spending a penny. In terms of material equipment, the party branch also gave the necessary support in terms of land, funds, and seeds. The branch also does not relax leadership in teaching, often going to the school to check on the work and solve problems in a timely manner. Zhongjiazhuang People-Run Elementary School has received active support from the masses. The teachers' dormitories were built with materials donated by the masses, the livestock farm was voluntarily given up by the masses, the walls were built of old broken bricks, the desks and chairs were brought by the students themselves, and the blackboards, class bells, and loudspeakers were pieced together from waste materials. After the school added classes and lacked teachers, the leadership asked the masses for ideas at the commune members' meeting. Soon, everyone recommended two teachers. The masses also helped the school tidy up the garden fields and plant vegetables by hand. In order to facilitate the collection of mass opinions, under the leadership of the party branch, the school also established a school affairs committee composed of seven cadres and parent representatives.

    民办学校的一面红旗
    仲家庄小学克服重重困难越办越好
    本报讯　江苏省兴化县陶庄公社仲家庄民办小学逐步发展壮大。仲家庄民办小学是1955年创办的。初创时学校设在一个破庙里，一共只有二十六名学生，现在已成了初具规模的完全小学，有教室、有宿舍、有操场、园地，拥有五个班级近二百名学生。学校所在大队的学龄儿童，已全部入学。
    几年来学校的教学质量不断提高。本学期县工作组在这个学校所在的辅导区举行抽考，这个学校四个年级语文、算术总平均成绩都超过了本区小学的水平。学生都参加了力所能及的体力劳动。他们开辟了三亩校园，养了几头猪羊。1958年到1959年内，学校校园生产产值达八百八十元，解决了学生们的书籍、簿本费和学校部分杂支费，减轻了大队和家长的负担。从这个学校毕业的学生，有的继续升学，有的当了扫盲教师。
    仲家庄民办小学师生们的教和学的热情非常高涨。校长仲长俊原来只读过私塾，算术没一点基础。但当他看到学校算术没人教时，便决心钻进去，先学后教。他进了县里举办的民校教师训练班和县教师进修学校，系统学习了语文和算术。开始备算术课，他不知从何入手，便与附近公办小学教师挂钩，虚心学习别人的经验。他特别注意课堂讲解和实际运用的结合。讲“重量单位”一节，他把升、秤等准备好，在课堂上让儿童们自己称量，讲粮食作物一课，他就带学生到园地上亲手培植玉蜀黍。学生在教师的积极教导下，学习情绪很高。他们从不轻易缺课，即使在大忙季节，到课率也在90％以上。
    这所民办学校所以办得好，是由于大队党支部的关怀和领导以及群众的支持。学校一开办，曾有一部分干部和教师追求形式，贪新图洋。房子还没有，就买了水泥准备盖厕所。支部向他们进行了勤俭办学的教育，说服教师卖了水泥买玻璃，先盖教室。厕所改用旧木料和破砂缸自己搭，一文钱没花。在物质设备方面，党支部也从土地、资金、种子等方面，给了必要的支援。在教学上，支部也不放松领导，经常到学校检查工作，发现问题，及时解决。仲家庄民办小学得到群众的积极支持，教师宿舍是群众献料盖的，畜牧场是群众自动让出的，围墙是用旧碎砖砌成的，桌椅是学生自带的，黑板、课铃、广播筒都是废旧材料拼凑而成。学校增添班级以后，缺少教师，领导上就在社员大会上请群众出主意。很快，大家就推举出两名教师。群众还亲手帮学校整理园田，种植菜蔬。为了便于集中群众意见，在党支部领导下，学校还成立了由七个干部和家长代表组成的校务委员会。
