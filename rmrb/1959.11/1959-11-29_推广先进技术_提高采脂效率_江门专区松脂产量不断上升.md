Promoting Advanced Technology to Improve Resin Tapping Efficiency
Jiangmen Special District's Rosin Production Continues to Rise

    (Our report) The Jiangmen Special District, a key rosin production area in Guangdong Province, continued to strengthen its leadership in rosin production during the busy autumn harvest season. Overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking, it vigorously promoted winter resin tapping techniques and chemical resin extraction methods. With a reduction in resin tapping labor, the district's rosin production has continuously increased, achieving a reduction in manpower and an increase in production.

    At the beginning of this month, the district had a total of more than 85,000 resin tappers. The average daily output in the first ten days was 99.2 tons. After the district entered the busy autumn harvest in the middle of the month, various localities temporarily transferred more than 40,000 people from the rosin production team to support the autumn harvest. On the 17th, there were actually 36,800 resin tappers. However, the average daily output for the seven days from the 11th to the 17th reached 106.3 tons, an increase of 7.16% compared to the average daily output in the first ten days. Calculated based on the actual number of resin tappers, the average work efficiency per person increased by 130%.

    The experience of Jiangmen District's rosin production in reducing manpower and increasing production proves that as long as the leadership grasps it tightly, winter resin tapping has great potential. During this period, the Jiangmen Prefectural Committee and party committees at all levels strengthened leadership and tightly grasped this production. Since the beginning of autumn, party committees at all levels have held production site meetings, telephone conferences, etc., to strengthen political work on the mountains, with cadres taking the lead in going up the mountains to set up camps. At the same time, various conservative ideas in this production were criticized.

    The Jiangmen Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China recently called on the rosin production workers and commune members to advance victoriously, work hard for forty days, and resolutely complete the annual rosin production task without missing a single jin.

    推广先进技术　提高采脂效率
    江门专区松脂产量不断上升
    本报讯　广东省松香重点产区——江门专区，在秋收大忙期间，继续加强了对松香生产的领导，克服右倾保守思想，大力推广冬季钩香技术和化学采脂方法，在采脂劳动力减少的情况下，全区松脂产量一直持续上升，做到了减人增产。
    本月初，全区采脂人数共八万五千多人，上旬的平均日产量为九十九点二吨；中旬全区秋收进入大忙后，各地先后从松香生产队伍中临时抽调四万多人回去支援秋收，到17日实有采脂人数三万六千八百多人，而11日到17日七天的平均日产量却达到一百零六点三吨，比上旬的平均日产量上升7.16％。按实有采脂人数计算，每人的平均工效提高130％。
    江门区松脂生产减人增产的经验证明，只要领导抓得紧，冬季采脂是大有可为的。在这期间，江门地委和各级党委加强领导，紧紧抓住这项生产。入秋以来，各级党委都召开产地会议、电话会议等，加强山头政治工作，干部带头上山安营扎寨。同时，批判了在这项生产中的各种保守思想。
    中共江门地委最近号召松香生产的职工和社员们乘胜前进，大干四十天，决心一斤不少地完成全年松香生产任务。
