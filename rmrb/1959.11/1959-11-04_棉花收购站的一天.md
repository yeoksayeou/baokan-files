    A Day at the Cotton Purchasing Station
    By Our Correspondent Wang Bingkui
    People living in cities may think that cities are the most prosperous and bustling places. However, the cotton purchasing stations in the countryside after a bumper harvest present a different kind of bustling scene. There are roads leading to all the people's communes, vehicles and livestock shuttling back and forth, and the purchasing stations are busy day and night. The Chengan Cotton Purchasing Station in Cixian County, Hebei Province, which we are introducing now, is one of these thousands of purchasing stations.
    One day, when the hazy night had not yet faded, the earth had already been awakened by the crowds eager to sell their bumper cotton harvest. On the highways, main roads, and paths leading to the Chengan purchasing station, the crowds and carts selling cotton were endless, like countless silver dragons galloping in the rolling white sea of cotton. The sound of rapid-fire horses' hooves, the chaotic ringing of bicycle bells, the loud singing and laughter of the people... echoed and reverberated in the clear autumn sky. On this day alone, according to incomplete statistics from the Chengan Commune, there were more than 900 various human and animal-powered vehicles, such as rubber-wheeled carts, firewood carts, flatbed carts, and platform carts, and more than 3,100 bicycles. As for the baskets for carrying cotton and the shoulder poles for carrying cotton, it was really difficult to count them. The number of people participating in the cotton sale reached 6,800. Among them were long-striding girls, women with bound feet tottering along, old men over sixty, and "Red Scarves" no more than three feet tall. Pan Qingyuan, an old man from Nan Yuko Village, was sixty-five years old and pushed 260 pounds of cotton on a small cart by himself. When someone asked him why he didn't push less, he shrugged his shoulders and said with a smile, "We picked a lot of cotton, how can we not transport it all? Pick, transport, and put it into storage as we go, that's what the branch secretary said!" He took a deep puff of his cigarette and continued, "Don't think I'm old, but with the commune and such a good harvest, I always have endless energy!" The old man said, wearing a proud expression, and laughed heartily. The "Red Scarves," having sold their cotton, skipped and jumped on their way back.
    The inside and outside of the purchasing station were packed with dense crowds of people and vehicles. The cotton on the square was piled up in heaps. The commune members selling cotton parked their bicycles at the bicycle storage area, drove their carts into the parking lot, gave their livestock plenty of fodder, and then went into the tea shed, drinking the free tea and exhaling thick puffs of smoke, talking loudly. After drinking their fill, the people went into the canteen specially set up for the cotton-selling masses to eat hot meals.
    Zhang Lianshou, the director of the purchasing station, said that the purchasing speed this year is three or four times faster than in previous years. In the past, purchasing 400,000 catties of cotton a day would require working until 12 o'clock at night to get it all into storage. This year, more than 1 million catties are purchased every day, and all of it can be collected and put into storage, while the number of purchasing staff has decreased compared to the past.
    When he talked about the reason for the speed, he said that this year, in order to respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and strive for a bumper harvest, the broad masses of commune members have generally implemented the "four separations" method of cotton harvesting, which includes separate picking, separate storage, separate drying, and separate transportation, resulting in uniform quality and easy grading. The rapid calculation method created by the accountants has been promoted, and the work efficiency has been increased by more than four times. Flatbed carts are fully used for weighing, and loading and unloading are also much faster. The important thing is that this year, the purchasing station, the transportation union, and the processing factory have formed a collaboration group to study and solve problems in a timely manner. The purchasing station guarantees accurate grading, weighing, and accounting, the transportation union guarantees timely transportation of cotton into storage, and the processing factory is responsible for keeping the cotton in good condition. The staff are conscientious and responsible in their work, grading accurately, which not only ensures the quality of the cotton but also satisfies the cotton-selling representatives.
    Director Zhang also told this story: One night, it was already past four o'clock in the morning. The porters had just gone back to rest, and the staff of the purchasing station had just fallen asleep when the West Matty production team came to sell cotton again. Staff members Zhang Fu and two others immediately got up, weighed the cotton, paid for it, and let the commune members selling cotton go home in a timely manner. By the time they had put the cotton into storage, it was already the break of dawn.
    The workers coming and going to transport cotton seemed to have 500-horsepower engines installed on their carts. Their fierce momentum made you worry more when crossing the cotton transportation road than when crossing Chang'an Street in Beijing or Peace Road in Tianjin. But no matter how fiercely the workers ran, when they saw fallen cotton on the road, they would immediately pick it up. As the saying goes, can you eat steamed buns without crumbs falling? But look at the inside and outside of this purchasing station, it is so neat and clean. The person in charge of the transportation union said that the workers are paid by the piece, earning more for transporting more, and there is no compensation for picking up fallen cotton. However, in the first ten days of October alone, the workers picked up more than 43,700 catties of fallen cotton. Why are they willing to earn less wages to do work for which there is no compensation? Dear readers, listen to what worker Xue Fengtang said: "If you don't pick it up, it will be ruined! What does it matter if you earn a little less, how valuable is it to take good care of the cotton!"
    As night fell, the accountant wrote the following numbers in the form: Today, a total of 2 million catties of seed cotton were purchased. Director Zhang said: "This year's cotton harvest is unprecedentedly large, and it is not enough to rely on daytime purchases alone. But there are difficulties in grading at night, and it may not be accurate. In order to complete the purchase task, facilitate the commune members to sell cotton, and ensure the quality of cotton, the purchasing station has sent technicians to each production team to inspect the cotton grades during the day, so that at night, only weighing and storage remain. In a while, the night battle will begin!"
    As the reporter walked out of the purchasing station, the rumbling of carts and the crisp sound of whips in the fields grew closer and closer. ...

### 棉花收购站的一天

    棉花收购站的一天
    本报记者　王炳奎
    住在城市的人，也许认为城市最繁华、最景气了。可是在农村丰收后的棉花收购站，却又是一番繁华热闹的景象；那里有通往各个人民公社的条条大路，来去穿梭的车辆和牲口，有采购站的日日夜夜。现在，我们介绍的河北磁县成安棉花收购站，就是这千万个采购站当中的一个。
    有一天，当朦胧的夜色尚未退去的时候，大地早被喜售丰收棉的人流踩醒了。在通往成安收购站的公路上，大道里，阡陌中，售棉的人群车队络绎不绝，像无数条银龙，驰驱在白浪滚滚的棉海中。骤雨似的马蹄得得声，自行车队杂乱的铃声，人们的高歌哄笑声……在秋高气爽的晴空里飘荡着、回旋着。就在这一天，仅据成安公社不完全的统计，出动的运输工具就有胶轮车、柴车、排子车、平车等各种人畜力车九百多辆，自行车三千一百多辆。至于背棉的筐子，抬棉的担子，实在是难以计算了。参加售棉的人数，达六千八百多名。其中有大步流星的姑娘，也有小脚蹒跚的妇女，有年过花甲的老汉，也有高不过三尺的“红领巾”。南鱼口村的潘清元老汉，六十五岁了，一个人用小车推着二百六十斤棉花。有人问他为什么不少推些，他抖抖肩膀，笑着说：“棉花摘得多，少推了哪能运完？随摘随运随入库，这是支书的话啊！”他深深地吸了口烟，接着说：“别看我岁数大，可是有了公社，有了这样的好年景，身上的劲可总使不完啊！”老汉带着自豪的神气，呵呵大笑起来。售完棉花的“红领巾”，蹦蹦跳跳地往回走。
    收购站的里里外外，满是密密麻麻的人群和车辆。广场上的棉花，成堆连片。售棉的社员们把自行车放在存车处，大车赶进停车场，给牲口上足了草料，然后走进茶棚，喝着免费供应的茶水，吐着大口浓烟，高谈阔论。喝足水的人们，又走进特为售棉群众设立的食堂，吃起热腾腾的饭菜来。
    购棉站主任张连守说，今年收购速度比往年提高三、四倍。过去每天收购四十万斤花，还要忙到夜里十二点才能入完库。今年每天收购一百多万斤，全能收完入完，而收购人员比过去却减少了。
    当他谈起快的原因时说，今年广大社员，为了响应八届八中全会的号召，争取丰产丰收，普遍实行了分摘、分存、分晒、分运的“四分”收棉法，因而质量均匀一致，容易定级。推行了会计们创造的快速计算法，工作效率提高四倍多。完全采用了平车过秤，装卸也都快多了。重要的是今年由采购站、搬运工会和加工厂组成了协作组，及时研究解决问题。采购站保证验级、过秤、算账准确，搬运工会保证及时运棉入库，加工厂负责把棉花保管好，组织配合得当。职工们工作认真负责，验级正确，既保证了棉花质量，又能得到售棉代表满意。
    张主任还讲了这样一个故事：一天深夜，已经四点多钟了。搬运工人们刚回去休息，收购站的职工们也刚刚睡下，西马堤生产队又卖棉花来了。职工张福等三人便马上起床，把棉花过了磅，付了款，让售棉的社员及时回家了。当他们把棉花入好库的时候，已经是鸡鸣破晓了。
    来来往往运棉的工人们，仿佛车上装了五百马力的发动机似的，那个猛劲，使你穿过运棉通路的时候，真比穿过北京的长安街、天津的和平路还要担心。别看工人们跑得那么猛，当他们看到路上有落花的时候，便立刻将棉花拾起来。俗语说，吃馍还能不掉渣？可是看看这采购站的里里外外吧，却是那么整整齐齐，干干净净。搬运工会负责人说，工人们是按件计工，多运多得，拾落地花是没有任何报酬的。但是，仅仅10月上旬，工人们就拾落地花四万三千七百多斤。为什么他们宁愿少得工资，去做没有任何报酬的工作呢？亲爱的读者，听听工人薛凤堂的话吧：“不拾起来就要糟蹋坏了啊！少得点工资算什么，保管好棉花又有多大价值哪！”
    夜幕降临了，会计在表格里写上了这样的数字：今日共收购籽棉二百万斤。张主任说：“今年棉花空前大丰收，单靠白天收购是不行的。可是夜间验级又有困难，恐怕不准确。为了完成收购任务，便利社员售棉，又能保证棉花质量，收购站派技术员到各生产队去，白天验好棉级，夜间收购就只剩下过磅入库了。过一会，夜战又要开始哩！”
    当记者走出收购站的时候，田野辚辚的车声，清脆的鞭声，越来越近了。……
