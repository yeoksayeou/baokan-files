Xinhua News Agency, November 9th. Central and Beijing leaders, along with over 12,000 workers from the capital, joined all the delegates attending the National "Congress of Heroes" in a celebratory gathering at the Great Hall of the People tonight, to celebrate the successful conclusion of the congress. The people of the capital warmly bid farewell to the heroes from all over the country as they returned to their posts, and wished them success in spreading advanced seeds throughout the country.

　　At the unprecedented grand evening party, all the delegates were warmly welcomed by the capital's workers. Wherever the heroes went, they were greeted with warm applause. These comrades-in-arms from the Great Leap Forward watched performances of Peking Opera, drama, film, acrobatics, and song and dance together, and participated in various games. More than a dozen artistic groups gave wonderful performances for the representatives. The entire Great Hall was filled with joy and excitement.

　　Party and state leaders Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, Dong Biwu, Peng Zhen, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Lu Dingyi, Bo Yibo, Yang Shangkun, Luo Ruiqing, Chen Shutong, Xie Juezai, Zhang Dingcheng, and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, Burhan, attended tonight's party and joined the heroes in the celebration.

　　Before the start of the evening party, Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, First Secretary of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, and Mayor of Beijing, along with Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, Secretaries of the Secretariat Zheng Tianxiang, Chen Peng, Chen Kehan, Fan Rusheng, Vice Mayors of Beijing Wan Li, Wang Kunlun, Cheng Hongyi, Jia Tingsan, Le Songsheng, Deputy Political Commissar of the Beijing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, Lieutenant General Zhang Nansheng, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions Wang Jiong, Chairman of the Beijing Women's Federation Zhang Xiaomei, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League Wang Zhaohua, and others, accompanied by Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, cordially met with the members of the Presidium of the National "Congress of Heroes." Peng Zhen congratulated the representatives of advanced producers and advanced collectives from all over the country on the successful conclusion of the Congress, and he hoped that the heroes would bring back the experience of this Congress, continue to exert their utmost efforts, and constantly achieve new successes in their work and production.

　　In the Great Auditorium, the contemporary heroes watched the ancient "Gathering of Heroes" – the Peking Opera "Battle of Red Cliffs." In the North Hall, more than 900 representatives and 1,600 workers, cadres, students, medical workers, and commercial workers from Beijing participated in the celebration. Some were watching the film "Song of Youth," while others watched the puppet show "Havoc in Heaven." The Heilongjiang shadow puppet troupe, which had just arrived in Beijing, performed folk tales with a unique style. In the center of the hall, table tennis and gymnastics athletes showed off their skills and gave wonderful performances for the heroes. In the crowd, Shi Dianzhao, the leader of the Youth Coal Mining Team of Nanguan Mine, Fenxi Mining Bureau, Shanxi Province, was playing the game "More Haul, Faster Run." After "arduous" efforts and two failures, he finally managed to get the "car" loaded with wood smoothly through the "long bridge" in ten seconds. He happily said to the people around him: "After we go back, we will also have a 'More Haul, Faster Run' campaign in the mine, to produce more coal!"

　　The banquet hall was brightly lit, and people watched dances, acrobatics, and magic shows to the sound of enthusiastic music. More than 2,000 advanced producers and veteran workers from Beijing warmly welcomed the heroes from all over the country.

　　In the lobby on the first floor, Man Zeyun, a representative from the Luda Machinery Factory, Wang Wentian, a representative from the Dalian General Machinery Factory, and Lu Shenghe, known as the "pace-setter" of technical innovation in Dalian, played games such as picking up beans and ring toss. Lu Shenghe, a milling worker, was the best at picking up beans and won first prize. Man Zeyun, a riveter, and Wang Wentian, a lathe operator, said: "Let's have a counterpart competition in production, and also have a counterpart competition in recreation." Soon after, Man Zeyun and Wang Wentian came to "report victory" with their prizes. These three representatives met at the Congress of Heroes. A few days ago, they agreed that after returning to their factories, they would perform technical demonstrations of riveting, milling, and turning for each other, make a leap forward together, and improve together.

　　The heroes were surrounded by college students from the capital and entered the dance floor. At this time, people sang and danced with great enthusiasm. During the intervals between dances, groups of college students surrounded the heroes and had heart-to-heart talks. Fourth-year students from the Department of Chemistry at Peking University surrounded Yang Yumin, a dyeing and finishing worker from the Harbin Woolen Mill. This young worker, who had created more than a dozen new technologies in the production of dyeing and finishing woolen fabrics, asked the college students to help him further improve his dyeing and finishing techniques in terms of chemical theory. They expressed that they would exchange production and learning experiences in future correspondence.

　　The evening party lasted until late at night. The evening party was jointly organized by the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, the Beijing Women's Federation, and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League.

    党和国家的领导人周恩来、朱德、邓小平、董必武、彭真、李富春、李先念、陆定一、薄一波、杨尚昆、罗瑞卿、陈叔通、谢觉哉、张鼎丞，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，都出席了今天的晚会，同英雄们一起联欢。

    大礼堂里，当代群英们观看了古代“群英会”——京剧“赤壁之战”。北大厅里，九百多名代表和北京市一千六百多名工人、干部、学生、医务工作者、商业工作者联欢。有的在看电影“青春之歌”，有的看木偶戏“闹天宫”，刚刚到北京的黑龙江皮影剧团演出了别具风格的民间故事剧。大厅的中央乒乓球和体操运动健将们大显身手，为英雄们作了精采表演。人群中，山西汾西矿务局南关矿青年采煤队队长史殿照正在玩“多拉快跑”的游戏。经过“艰苦”的努力和两次失败，他终于使满载木材的“小汽车”在十秒钟内顺利通过了“长桥”。他高兴地向身旁的人们说：“我们回去以后，也要在矿井下面来一个‘多拉快跑’运动，增产更多的煤炭！”
    宴会厅里灯火辉煌，人们在热情奔放的乐声中，观看着舞蹈、杂技、魔术。北京两千多名先进生产者和老工人亲切地招待着各地英雄们。
    在一楼大厅里，旅大机械一厂代表满泽运、大连通用机器厂代表王文田和被誉为大连技术革新“标兵”的卢盛和玩起了夹豆子、套圈等游戏。铣工卢盛和夹豆子的本领最大，得了个一等奖，铆工满泽运和车工王文田说：“来，咱们生产上展开对口赛，游艺上也来个对口赛”。过不久，满泽运、王文田都拿着奖品来“报捷”。这三位代表是在群英会上相识的，前几天他们约定，回厂后要互相作铆、铣、车三种工种的技术表演，一齐跃进，共同提高。
    英雄被首都的大学生簇拥着走进了舞池，这时，人们高歌起舞，热情澎湃。在跳舞的间歇，一群群大学生围着英雄促膝谈心。北京大学化学系四年级的学生把哈尔滨毛织厂染整工人杨玉民包围了起来。这个在染整毛织品的生产中创造了十多种新技术的青年工人，要求大学生们在化学理论上帮助他进一步提高染整技术。他们表示要在今后的通信中交流生产和学习经验。
    这个联欢晚会一直持续到深夜才结束。晚会是由中共北京市委员会、北京市人民委员会、北京市总工会、解放军驻北京部队、北京市妇联、共青团北京市委六个单位联合举办的。（附图片）
