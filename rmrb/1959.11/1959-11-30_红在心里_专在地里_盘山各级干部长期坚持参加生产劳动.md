Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 27th: In Pan Shan County, Liaoning Province, it has become common practice for cadres at all levels to participate in productive labor. In the first nine months of this year, over 96% of the county's 1,416 cadres participated in productive labor, contributing a total of 68,662 workdays, averaging 61.2 workdays per person. All twenty-seven members of the County Party Committee participated in labor, averaging 35.2 workdays per person. Due to the active participation of cadres at all levels, especially leading cadres, in production and leading production, the relationship between cadres and the masses has been further strengthened, the enthusiasm of the masses has been boosted, and production has been promoted. The ideological style of cadres at all levels has also undergone great changes.

The participation of cadres in this county in production and leading production is mainly achieved through vigorously developing experimental plots. The vast majority of cadres above the production brigade level throughout the county have cultivated experimental plots. These experimental plots, especially those cultivated by the County Party Committee and the Commune Party Committee, have become positions for guiding production, training cadres, and educating the masses in every stage of production. From January to August, the county successively held 152 on-site meetings in these experimental plots, directly educating 4,034 people. In the early stage of spring sowing, some cadres and the masses did not fully understand the benefits of close planting, resulting in sparse planting in wide ridges in some areas. An Wenxiang, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, hosted an on-site corn planting meeting in his experimental plot, personally demonstrating plowing and adopting methods of explanation, observation, and debate to help the cadres and the masses present to improve their understanding and learn the technology. After the meeting, the county promoted the experience of narrowing ridges and increasing rows, and rationally close planting, with a total of 293,750 mu of land having ridges narrowed and rows increased. During summer hoeing, a cotton pruning on-site meeting was held in the experimental plot led by Wang Ling, the Secretary of the County Party Committee, overcoming the "unhurried" mentality of some production team cadres and helping them to improve their pruning skills.

Cadres at all levels went deep into the fields to participate in productive labor, timely discovering and solving problems encountered in production. Ji Deshun, the First Secretary of the Bohai Commune Party Committee, inspected work in two brigades and discovered through field labor that there were missing seedlings in some corn and sorghum fields. He promptly convened a meeting to educate cadres and the masses, launching an activity to check and replant seedlings. As a result, the commune's grain crops all had full stands of seedlings. Zhang Jingli, the First Secretary of the Shaling Commune Party Committee, went to Rehetai during the autumn harvest, working for half a day and working for half a day, taking the lead in harvesting crops even on rainy days, which greatly encouraged the commune members. He discovered in labor that some fields were not harvested cleanly, and some grain was scattered, so he promptly led the commune members to collect the grain, ensuring that every grain was brought home. Liu Zhenhuan, Secretary of the Communist Youth League of Pan Shan County, was sent down to the Gaosheng Brigade of Gaosheng Commune as a commune member for a month, eating, living, and working with the commune members, always taking the lead and learning from the peasants in everything, and was rated as a Red Banner Bearer by the masses. The masses praised: "The Communist Party is truly our family, caring for us in every way. The cadres in the county eat and work with us. Where could we find such a thing in the old society?"

After the cadres participated in productive labor, they learned production techniques, strengthened their labor outlook and mass outlook, and their ideological style has greatly changed. According to statistics from Gaosheng and Shaling communes: among the forty-five members of the Party Committee, thirty-five are now familiar with the entire production process, generally understand the management techniques of various crops, and can independently direct production; seven are generally familiar with the production process and understand the management techniques of several major crops; only three members of the Party Committee are currently not familiar enough with agricultural production. Qin Yulin, Secretary of the Communist Youth League of Bohai Commune, used to have a commanding style and often lost his temper with the masses. After rectification and participating in physical labor, he consulted with the masses on matters and was praised by the masses, completely changing his style.

Pan Shan County's cadres have achieved such great success in participating in productive labor mainly because the County Party Committee attaches importance to this work and always pays attention to strengthening leadership. At the beginning of this year, the County Party Committee made a decision to have cadres vigorously develop experimental plots, repeatedly explaining the importance of cadres participating in production and leading production for realizing the agricultural leap forward, consolidating the achievements of rectification, and completely changing their style, proposing the slogans and requirements that every cadre should "go to the field with the sowing and return home with the grain" and be "red in heart and specialized in the field." At the same time, according to the professional characteristics of the cadres and the needs of production, good labor arrangements were made. In addition to mobilizing cadres to cultivate experimental plots, various methods such as long-term assignment, short-term assignment, and supporting shock production tasks were adopted to give all cadres the opportunity to participate in productive labor. Systems were established, regular assessments were conducted, pace-setters were established, and promoted in a timely manner. All of these have greatly promoted the participation of cadres in productive labor.

### 红在心里  专在地里  盘山各级干部长期坚持参加生产劳动

    红在心里  专在地里
    盘山各级干部长期坚持参加生产劳动
    新华社沈阳27日电　辽宁省盘山县各级干部参加生产劳动形成风气。在今年头九个多月中，全县一千四百一十六名干部96％以上都参加了生产劳动，共做了六万八千六百六十二个劳动日，平均每人做六十一点二个劳动日。县委委员二十七人，全部参加了劳动，平均每人做三十五点二个劳动日。由于各级干部特别是领导干部积极参加生产领导生产，进一步密切了干部和群众的关系，鼓舞了群众的干劲，推动了生产；各级干部的思想作风也发生了很大的变化。
    这个县干部参加生产领导生产，主要是通过大搞试验田实现的。全县生产大队以上干部绝大部分种了试验田。这些试验田，特别是县委、公社党委种的试验田，在各个时期的生产环节上成了指导生产、训练干部和教育群众的阵地。从1月到8月，全县先后在这些试验田召开了一百五十二次现场会议，有四千零三十四人直接受到了教育。春播初期，某些干部和群众对密植的好处认识不足，因而某些地区出现了大垅稀植的现象。县委第一书记安文祥就在他领导的试验田里主持玉米播种现场会，亲自扶犁表演，并采取说、看、辩的方法，帮助到会干部和群众提高了认识，学习了技术。会后，全县推行了缩垅增行、合理密植的经验，全县共缩垅增行二十九万三千七百五十亩。夏锄时，在县委书记王玲领导的试验田里召开了棉花整枝现场会，克服了部分生产队干部中“不慌不忙”的思想，并帮助他们提高了整枝技术。
    各级干部深入田间参加生产劳动，及时发现和解决了生产中遇到的问题。渤海公社党委第一书记计德顺到两个大队检查工作，通过田间劳动发现有些玉米、高粱地里缺苗，及时召开会议教育干部和群众，开展了查苗、补苗活动。结果，全公社粮食作物达到了全苗。沙岭公社党委第一书记张井礼，在秋收时到热河台半天劳动半天工作，下雨天也带头收庄稼，对社员鼓舞很大。他在劳动中发现有些地里收得不干净，抛撒了一些粮食，就及时领导社员们拣粮，做到颗粒还家。共青团盘山县委书记刘振宦下放到高升公社高升大队当了一个月社员，和社员同吃同住同劳动，事事走在前面，处处向农民学习，被群众评为红旗手。群众赞扬说：“共产党真是我们的亲人，处处关心我们。县里的干部和我们一块吃一块干活，在旧社会哪里有这样的事。”
    干部参加生产劳动后，学会了生产技术，增强了劳动观点和群众观点，思想作风都有了很大改变。据高升、沙岭两个公社统计：四十五名党委委员中，现在有三十五名已熟悉全部生产过程，一般地懂得各种作物的管理技术，能独立指挥生产；七名一般地熟悉生产过程，懂得几种主要作物的管理技术；只有三名党委委员目前对农业生产还不够熟悉。渤海公社团委书记秦玉林，过去有强迫命令作风，常向群众发脾气。经过整风，又参加了体力劳动以后，有事同群众商量，受到了群众的好评，彻底转变了作风。
    盘山县干部参加生产劳动取得这样大的成绩，主要是由于县委重视这一工作，始终注意加强领导。今年年初县委就作出干部大搞试验田的决定，反复地讲解了干部参加生产领导生产，对实现农业跃进、巩固整风成果和彻底转变作风的重要性，提出每个干部都要“随种下地，随粮回家”“红在心里，专在地里”的口号和要求。同时根据干部的业务特点和生产上的需要，作好劳动安排。除发动干部种试验田外，并采取长期下放、短期下放、支援突击性生产任务等各种方式，使所有干部都有机会参加生产劳动。并订立制度，定期考核；树立标兵，及时推广。所有这些，对干部参加生产劳动起了很大的促进作用。
