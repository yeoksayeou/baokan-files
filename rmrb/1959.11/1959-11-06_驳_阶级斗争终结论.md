    Refuting the "Theory of the End of Class Struggle"
    Xu Zhengfan
    The entire historical era of transition from capitalism to socialism is filled with the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.

    Right-leaning opportunists who face capitalism and turn their backs on socialism are teachers by negative example for the people. Through the words and deeds of these teachers by negative example, we have understood many new things, among which we have deeply realized that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao’s analysis of the class struggle situation in our country’s transition period, and the summary of the law that class struggle in the transition period is long-term and develops in a wave-like manner, are incomparably wise and infinitely correct. However, even now, there are still people who intentionally or unintentionally spread the lie that class struggle has ended. This lie is undoubtedly a shield for right-leaning opportunists. Therefore, all arguments about the so-called end of class struggle must be seriously criticized.

    Marxist-Leninist classic writers have repeatedly emphasized this truth: the transition from capitalism to socialism is an entire historical era, and this transition period is filled with the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The basic points of the Party’s General Line for Socialist Construction have also clearly stipulated that we must "continue to complete the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts" and continue to wage struggle against the bourgeoisie on these three fronts. However, some people, even some who claim to be Marxist-Leninists, actually put forward views on this issue that are fundamentally different from the Party and the Marxist-Leninist classic writers, and sing a completely opposing tune. Some declare that the Chinese people have already completed the historical era of class struggle domestically; others advocate that the social revolution has ended and that we should fully turn to the natural revolution, directing the spearhead of resolving contradictions towards nature; still others emphasize that the struggle to implement the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction is merely a contradiction of two methods, not a struggle between two classes and two roads; or they believe that it is really doubtful whether there are any remnants of the struggle between two roads existing in our country today. In a word, they attempt to use the theory of the end of class struggle woven from subjective illusions to negate the living reality of class struggle. However, facts have a cold, steely face, and it will never be changed by certain absurd theories. In the face of impartial facts, the "arguments" of the theory of the end of class struggle are bound to be battered and bruised.

    Some people have a habit of resorting to this argument: starting from the principle that class differences stem from different relationships to the means of production, and then citing the fact that the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in our country has been basically completed, they then draw the following conclusion: since the capitalist private ownership of the means of production has been replaced by the socialist public ownership of the means of production, it means that the bourgeoisie has been eliminated, the contradiction between the two roads of socialism and capitalism has been resolved, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has been declared over. They start from correct premises and draw wrong conclusions. Anyone with a little Marxist-Leninist common sense knows that eliminating private ownership of the means of production is indeed a big step forward towards realizing the great goal of eliminating classes, but it is by no means the last step. Because although class differences are based on different relationships to the means of production, the economic position of each class produces the relationships of each class, and thus also produces politics. The struggle to maintain class differences and eliminate class differences has always been concentrated and reflected in political struggle. Lenin said it well: politics is the concentrated expression of economics. And ideological struggle is a reflection of economic struggle and political struggle. Because politics has a particularly important role, before the proletariat seizes power, "from the principle that economic interests have a decisive role, we must never draw the conclusion that economic struggle (i.e., the struggle of trade unions) has primary significance, because generally speaking, the most important 'decisive' class interests can only be satisfied by fundamental political reform; for example, the basic economic interests of the proletariat can only be satisfied through a political revolution in which the dictatorship of the proletariat replaces the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 5, People's Publishing House edition, p. 359) After seizing power, from the principle that economic interests have a decisive role, we must never draw the conclusion that economic work determines everything, mistakenly believing that once the socialist revolution on the economic front has achieved a decisive victory, the struggle is over, everything is fine, and all is well. Because generally speaking, without the victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, the victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front is incomplete and not consolidated.

    To eliminate the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, we must completely eliminate the economic contradictions between the two classes, and also completely eliminate the political and ideological contradictions.

    It is very obvious that to eliminate the bourgeoisie, we should not only eliminate the capitalist private ownership of the means of production, but also fundamentally change the political stance and ideological views of the vast majority of members of this class; to eliminate the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, we should not only completely and thoroughly resolve the economic contradictions between these two classes, but also completely and thoroughly resolve the political and ideological contradictions between the two classes, because class struggle is manifested not only in the economy, but also in politics and ideology, especially in politics. Looking at the current situation in our country, imperialism dreams of overthrowing us day and night, and is trying every possible means to engage in subversive and destructive activities; Taiwan has not yet been liberated, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique is clamoring for "counter-attacking the mainland" every day; the transformation of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists is far from complete; capitalists are still receiving fixed interest payments, and some bourgeois elements are still stubbornly adhering to the capitalist political stance and ideological views (their political ideas have a certain market among intellectuals and well-to-do middle peasants); as for the countryside, there are still some privately owned means of production, and there is still a primary market for private activities. All this shows that classes still exist in our country, and the class struggle is far from over. Starting from this fact, Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field, will still be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes even very acute." (See "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") Looking at the reality of class struggle in our country, and thinking about Comrade Mao Zedong's incisive analysis of this reality, we will naturally have this question: what basis do those who hold the view of the end of class struggle have to dare to declare that classes and class struggle no longer exist in our country, and that even the remnants have vanished? Is it temporary confusion, unable to see the truth of the facts? Is it a dream talk arising from weariness of class struggle? Or is it ulterior motives, deliberately distorting the facts?

    The decisive victory of the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts has made the general trend of class struggle tend to ease, but the struggle still has ups and downs.

    Seeing that the previous argument could not stand, some people brought out another argument: following the decisive victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front in our country, the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has also achieved a decisive victory. Then, classes should be considered eliminated, and the struggle should be considered over, right? Moreover, doesn't the proposal of the tasks of technological revolution and cultural revolution prove that the spearhead of resolving contradictions has shifted from society to nature, and that the central task now is to march towards nature? This is another case of drawing wrong conclusions from correct premises. Yes, the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts in our country has achieved decisive victories one after another, but the achievement of this series of victories only means that the contradictions and struggles between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on these three fronts have been basically resolved, but it does not mean that all problems have been comprehensively, thoroughly, and ultimately resolved. A careful examination of the laws of class struggle in our country's transition period shows this point: whenever the proletariat achieves some major victories over the bourgeoisie in class struggle, class struggle shifts from tension to relaxation, but in this state, the anti-socialist elements in the bourgeoisie do not sleep; they are always busy collecting remnants and defeated generals, reorganizing their forces, accumulating strength, or taking advantage of certain disturbances in the international situation, or taking advantage of certain temporary and local difficulties encountered by the socialist construction cause at home, and they re-launch a rampant offensive. In this way, the following situation appears in the class struggle: on the one hand, because the proletariat is constantly defeating the bourgeoisie on all fronts, the balance of power between the two classes is changing in favor of the former and unfavorable to the latter. Therefore, the general trend of class struggle is gradually moving towards relaxation, and eventually elimination; on the other hand, because of the above-mentioned bourgeoisie's unwillingness to accept its defeat, and after each defeat, it always wants to come back and compete with the proletariat again, this determines that the general trend of class struggle towards gradual relaxation and eventual elimination is not a straight line, but presents a wave-like state, sometimes high, sometimes low, sometimes sharp, sometimes relatively gentle. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "The political struggle and ideological struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie are inevitable throughout the entire transition period. However, this struggle is like the ups and downs of waves, sometimes high, sometimes low, sometimes sharp, sometimes relatively gentle. This struggle will not end until the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie is finally eliminated." (See "The Victory of Marxism-Leninism in China") From this, it can be seen that in today's China, where the capitalist private ownership of the means of production has been basically eliminated, but capitalists still receive fixed interest payments; in today's China, where the political power of the bourgeoisie has been greatly weakened, but its certain influence still exists; in today's China, where capitalist ideology has been discredited, but has not been finally eliminated, it is absurd and groundless to try to sell the goods of class elimination and the end of class struggle based on the fact that the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts in our country has achieved a decisive victory.

    The proposal of the tasks of technological revolution and cultural revolution does not indicate the end of class struggle, but is a continuation of the socialist revolution in the technological and cultural fields.

    As for the proposal of the tasks of technological revolution and cultural revolution, it certainly indicates a further deepening of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. The question is whether this deepening is the end of any social revolution. The reason is: first of all, technological revolution and cultural revolution are not simply revolutions of nature. In the process of realizing these two revolutionary tasks, the different cultural views of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and their different views on technology are bound to launch a sharp struggle, and the purpose of realizing these two revolutions is to build our country into great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture and modern science and culture as soon as possible. Secondly, the natural revolution and the social revolution cannot be completely separated. Our march towards nature is carried out under the leadership of the Party and on the basis of socialist relations of production. It cannot be separated from putting politics in command, from ideological work, or from the correct handling of relations between people. Therefore, we have always believed that the natural revolution and the social revolution are closely linked and not mutually exclusive. The social revolution has promoted the struggle between man and nature, and the struggle between man and nature has in turn affected the social revolution. In today's China, where large-scale socialist construction is being carried out, the march towards nature has indeed been raised to a very important position. It is precisely in order to ensure that the march towards nature can achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and in order to consolidate and expand the achievements of the struggle with nature, we must carry out the social revolution more thoroughly instead of the so-called stopping the social revolution. Thirdly, to negate the social revolution with the natural revolution is essentially to negate the existence of classes and class struggle, to negate the necessity of strengthening the Party's leadership and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to lead people into the maze of separating from politics. Finally, the view that the proposal of the tasks of technological revolution and cultural revolution is a complete shift of the spearhead of resolving contradictions towards nature is contrary to the Party's instructions on these two revolutionary tasks. In the basic points of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the tasks of technological revolution and cultural revolution are mentioned at the same time as "mobilizing all positive factors, correctly handling contradictions among the people," "consolidating and developing socialist ownership by the whole people and collective ownership, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and the international unity of the proletariat," and "continuing to complete the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts," and so on. The Party has neither equated the technological revolution and the cultural revolution with the social revolution, nor has it hinted at stopping the social revolution in order to fully turn to the natural revolution. The set of ideas published by those who hold the view of the end of class struggle on this issue are all fabricated out of thin air.

    Right-leaning opportunist thought is a reflection of class struggle within the Party.

    Objective facts always contradict all the arguments and proofs of the theory of the end of class struggle, and some right-leaning opportunist words and deeds once again prove the bankruptcy of all claims about the end of class struggle. Faced with this difficult-to-justify situation, some people have come up with a new argument: right-leaning opportunism is a problem within the Party. It is neither a product of bourgeois political thought, nor a reflection of the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The intention of putting forward this view is to kill two birds with one stone: to defend the "theory of the end of class struggle" and to protect right-leaning opportunism. Of course, because of the error of the position and the absurdity of the views, this arrow will not only fail to hit the feathers of the bird, but will instead pierce the archer's mask.

    When judging the class nature of right-leaning opportunism, we should not formalistically see whether it is a problem inside or outside the Party, nor should we look only at the class origins of some representatives of right-leaning opportunism from the perspective of the theory of the only determining factor, but we should look at the social class roots from which right-leaning opportunist thought arises and the class interests it reflects. In our country at the present stage, it is the bourgeoisie and those who represent bourgeois forces who fear the great leap forward in socialist construction, who fear the mass revolutionary movement led by the Party, and who fear the people's commune movement. Among them, those who adhere to the capitalist stand always openly resist, complain, or nitpick at these movements, and rack their brains to find ways to drag the revolutionary mass movement back, so as to prolong the life of the bourgeoisie. The right-leaning opportunists' attack on the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune movement reflects the bourgeois standpoints, views, and ideological sentiments. This is a reflection of bourgeois thought within the Party, and a reflection of the struggle between two roads within the Party.

    At a time when the people of the whole country are enthusiastically responding to the Party's call to resolutely launch a struggle against right-leaning opportunism, the theory of the end of class struggle has appeared, which mainly shows these two problems: first, some class alien elements who are resolutely anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist are currently carrying out class struggle on a large scale under the guise of advocating the end of class struggle, and are engaging in sinister sabotage activities. We must be vigilant against these people and resolutely launch a struggle against them. Second, some people who spread this absurd theory are either right-leaning opportunists themselves, attempting to use this to ease class struggle, essentially paving the way for the restoration of capitalism; or they are suffering from right-leaning paralysis, or they are acting on the bad roots of intellectuals, fearing and being weary of class struggle, fearing and being weary of undergoing ideological transformation through the baptism of class struggle; or they are only focusing on business and forgetting politics, drilling into a dead end of only being specialized and not being red, and thus turning a blind eye to the reality of class struggle in our country, and even wishing to end class struggle and ideological transformation as soon as possible. For these people, we must shout loudly to them: comrades, you are wrong, wake up quickly!

    Because it violates the living reality of class struggle in our country, and because it violates the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism on class and class struggle, the "theory of the end of class struggle" is theoretically wrong and politically harmful. Spreading this view is beneficial to all anti-socialist forces that are deliberately carrying out class struggle against the proletariat and its political party; spreading this view is not conducive to strengthening the people's revolutionary vigilance, but instead encourages paralysis and carelessness, and ideologically disarms a part of the people from class struggle; spreading this view blurs people's understanding of the class nature and harmfulness of right-leaning opportunism. In short, the "theory of the end of class struggle" is something that is absolutely unacceptable. We must thoroughly criticize this stuff, resist this stuff, let it not find a market or a customer, and force the "theory of the end of class struggle" to close shop as soon as possible.

    驳“阶级斗争终结论”
    许征帆
    从资本主义过渡到社会主义的整个历史时代，充满资产阶级同无产阶级的阶级斗争
    面向资本主义而背向社会主义的右倾机会主义者，是人民的反面教员。通过这些反面教员的言行，使我们懂得了许多新的东西，就中也使我们深刻地体会到，党中央和毛主席关于我国过渡时期阶级斗争形势的分析，关于过渡时期阶级斗争是长期的、波浪式发展的规律的概括，是无比英明和无限正确的。但是，直到现在，还有人有意无意地散布所谓阶级斗争结束了的谎言。这种谎言无疑是右倾机会主义者的挡箭牌，因此，对一切所谓阶级斗争终结的论调，必须严肃地加以批判。
    马克思列宁主义经典作家，早已三番五次地强调过这样一个真理：从资本主义过渡到社会主义是一个整个的历史时代，在这个过渡时期里，充满着无产阶级与资产阶级的阶级斗争。党的社会主义建设总路线的基本点，也早已明确规定，我们要“继续完成经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命”，要在这三条战线上，继续与资产阶级展开斗争。但是，有一些人，甚至某些自命为马克思列宁主义者，竟然在这个问题上，提出与党、与马克思列宁主义经典作家根本不同的看法，大唱其对台戏。或宣布中国人民在国内已经走完阶级斗争的历史时代；或鼓吹社会革命已经结束，应全力转向自然革命，把解决矛盾的矛头指向自然；或强调贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的斗争，只是两种方法的矛盾，而不是两个阶级、两条道路的斗争；或认为目前我国是否还有两条道路斗争的残余存在，实在值得怀疑。一句话，他们企图用主观幻觉编织成的阶级斗争终结论，去否定活生生的阶级斗争现实。可是，事实有一副冷冰冰的铁面孔，它绝不会因为某些奇谈怪论而有所改变。在铁面无私的事实面前，阶级斗争终结论的那些“论据”，必然要碰得焦头烂额。
    某些人癖好搬弄这样一套：从阶级区别是根源于对生产资料的不同关系的原理出发，再援引我国资本主义工商业社会主义改造基本完成的事实，然后作出这样的推论：既然资本主义的生产资料私有制被社会主义的生产资料公有制所代替，那就意味着资产阶级已经消灭，社会主义与资本主义两条道路的矛盾业已解决，无产阶级与资产阶级的阶级斗争已宣告结束。他们从正确的前提出发，做出了错误的结论。稍微有点马克思列宁主义常识的人都知道，消灭了生产资料私有制，的确是向实现消灭阶级的伟大目标跃进了一大步，但这绝不是最后一步。因为阶级的区别虽然是建立在对生产资料的不同关系的基础上，但是各阶级的经济地位产生各阶级的关系，从而也就产生政治。维护阶级区别与消灭阶级区别的斗争，一向是集中反映在政治斗争之上。列宁说得好：政治是经济的集中表现。而思想斗争，又是经济斗争与政治斗争的反映。由于政治具有特殊重要的作用，无产阶级在取得政权以前，“从经济利益有决定作用的原理中，决不应当做出经济斗争（即工会的斗争）有首要意义的结论，因为一般说来，最重要的‘有决定作用的’阶级利益只能用根本的政治改革来满足；例如，无产阶级的基本经济利益只能经过用无产阶级专政代替资产阶级专政的政治革命来满足。”（列宁全集第五卷，人民出版社版，第359页）在取得政权以后，从经济利益有决定作用的原理中，也绝不应当做出经济工作决定一切的结论，误认为经济战线上的社会主义革命一经取得决定性的胜利，斗争就结束了，万事大吉，天下太平。因为一般说来，没有政治战线与思想战线上社会主义革命的胜利，经济战线上的社会主义革命胜利是不彻底、不巩固的。
    要消灭资产阶级与无产阶级的矛盾，就要彻底消灭两个阶级在经济上的矛盾，还要彻底消灭政治、思想上的矛盾
    很明显的，要消灭资产阶级，不仅应该消灭资本主义生产资料私有制，而且需要根本改变这个阶级的绝大多数成员的政治立场与思想观点；要消灭无产阶级与资产阶级的阶级斗争，就不仅应该全部、彻底解决这两个阶级在经济上的矛盾，而且需要全部、彻底解决两个阶级在政治上与思想上的矛盾，因为阶级斗争，既表现在经济上，也表现在政治和思想上，特别是政治上。拿我国目前情况来看，帝国主义日日夜夜梦想搞垮我们，千方百计地搞颠复破坏活动；台湾还没有解放，蒋介石集团天天叫嚣什么“反攻大陆”；地富反坏右的改造还远没有完成；资本家还拿定息，一部分资产阶级分子还顽强地坚持资本主义的政治立场与思想观点（他们的政治思想在知识分子、在富裕中农中都有一定的市场）；至于农村，也还有一部分私人所有的生产资料，还有私人活动的初级市场。这一切说明，我国阶级仍然存在，阶级斗争远没有结束。从这一事实出发，毛泽东同志这样告诉我们：“无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”（见“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”）看看我国阶级斗争的现实，想想毛泽东同志对这种现实的精辟的分析，我们自然会产生这样一个问题：持有阶级斗争终结观点的人，究竟根据什么居然敢于宣布我国阶级与阶级斗争已不存在、甚至连残余都化为乌有呢？是一时糊涂，看不清事实的真相？是厌倦了阶级斗争而发出梦呓？还是别有用心，故意歪曲事实？
    经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上社会主义革命的决定性胜利，使阶级斗争的总的趋势趋向缓和，但斗争还有起伏
    眼看前一套论调实在站不住脚，某些人又搬出另外一套：继我国经济战线的社会主义革命取得决定性胜利之后，政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命又取得了决定性的胜利，这样，阶级总该算消灭了，斗争总该是结束了吧？何况技术革命与文化革命任务的提出，不是证明解决矛盾的矛头已由社会转向自然，现在的中心任务是向大自然进军吗？这又是从正确的前提出发做出了错误的结论。是的，我国经济战线、政治战线、思想战线的社会主义革命，已经先后取得决定性的胜利，但是这一系列胜利的取得，只是意味着无产阶级与资产阶级在这三条战线上的矛盾与斗争，获得了基本的解决，而并不是说一切问题已全面、彻底、最终地解决了。细致地考察一下我国过渡时期阶级斗争的规律，就可以看到这样一点：每当无产阶级在阶级斗争中对资产阶级取得某些重大胜利之后，阶级斗争就由紧张转入缓和，但在这种状态中，资产阶级中的反社会主义分子并没有睡觉，他们总是忙着收集残兵败将，重整旗鼓，积蓄力量，或趁国际形势上的某些风吹草动，或趁国内社会主义建设事业碰到某些暂时的、局部的困难，便重新发动猖狂的进攻。这样一来，在阶级斗争上就出现这样的局面：一方面，由于无产阶级不断地在各条战线上战胜资产阶级，两个阶级力量对比是往有利于前者而不利于后者的方面变化的，因此，阶级斗争的总的趋势是逐步走向缓和，以至于最后消灭；另一方面，由于存在着上面提到的那种资产阶级不甘心自己的失败，每次吃败仗之后，总想卷土重来，再与无产阶级较量较量，这就决定阶级斗争的那种逐步走向缓和以至于最后消灭的总趋势，不是直线而下，而是呈现波浪起伏状态，高一阵、低一阵，再高一阵、再低一阵。刘少奇同志说：“无产阶级和资产阶级之间的政治斗争和思想斗争，在整个过渡时期都是不可避免的。不过这种斗争像波浪的起伏一样，有时候高，有时候低，有时候表现尖锐，有时候比较缓和。这种斗争，要到资产阶级的政治的和思想的影响最后消灭的时候，才会熄灭。”（见“马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利”）由此可见，在资本主义生产资料私有制虽已基本消灭，但资本家依旧领取定息的今天；在资产阶级政治势力虽大大削弱，但其一定的影响仍然存在的今天；在资本主义思想虽已被搞臭，但未被最后消灭的今天，想根据我国经济、政治、思想三条战线上社会主义革命取得决定性胜利的事实，来推销阶级消灭、阶级斗争结束了的货色，是荒唐透顶，没有任何根据的。
    技术革命和文化革命任务的提出，并不表明阶级斗争的结束，而是社会主义革命在技术和文化领域中的继续
    至于技术革命和文化革命任务的提出，诚然是表明我国社会主义革命与社会主义建设的进一步深化。问题是这种深化并不是什么社会革命的结束。理由是：首先，技术革命与文化革命根本不是单纯革自然的命，在实现这两个革命任务的过程中，无产阶级与资产阶级的不同的文化观与对技术的不同看法，必定要展开尖锐的斗争，而实现这两个革命的目的，又是为了尽快地把我国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大社会主义国家。其次，自然革命与社会革命是不可能截然分开的，我们向大自然进军，是在党的领导下，在社会主义生产关系的基础上进行的，离不开政治挂帅，离不开思想工作，离不开对人与人的关系的正确处理，因此，我们一向认为自然革命与社会革命是紧密联系而不是互相排斥的，社会革命推进了人与自然的斗争，人与自然的斗争又反过来影响社会革命。在我国开展大规模社会主义建设的今天，向自然进军的确是被提到了一个很重要的位置。正是为了保证在向自然进军中能取得多快好省的成效，为了巩固和扩大与自然斗争的成果，我们就必须更彻底的进行社会革命而不是所谓停止社会革命。再次，以自然革命来否定社会革命，实质上就是否定阶级与阶级斗争的存在的事实，否定加强党的领导与巩固无产阶级专政的必要，把人们引进脱离政治的迷宫。最后，认为技术革命与文化革命任务的提出是解决矛盾的矛头完全转向自然的说法，是违背党对这两个革命任务的指示的，在党的社会主义建设总路线的基本点中，技术革命与文化革命的任务，是与“调动一切积极因素，正确处理人民内部矛盾”，“巩固和发展社会主义的全民所有制和集体所有制，巩固无产阶级专政和无产阶级的国际团结”，“继续完成经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命”等等同时并提的。党既没有把技术革命、文化革命与社会革命划等号，更没有暗示什么停止社会革命以全力转向自然革命。持有阶级斗争终结观点的人，在这个问题上发表的那一套，全是捕风捉影，胡诌出来的。
    右倾机会主义思想是阶级斗争在党内的反映
    客观事实总是与阶级斗争终结论的一切论点论据闹别扭，一些右倾机会主义的言行，又一次证明一切关于阶级斗争结束的说法的破产。面对着这种难于自圆其说的局面，又有某些人搬出新的一套：右倾机会主义是党内的问题，既不是什么资产阶级政治思想的产物，更不是资产阶级与无产阶级阶级斗争的反映。提出这套看法的用意是一箭双雕：捍卫“阶级斗争终结论”，保护右倾机会主义。当然，因为立场的错误与观点的荒谬，这一箭不但连雕毛都挨不着，反而会戳穿射箭者的假面具。
    我们在判断右倾机会主义的阶级本质时，不应该形式主义地看它是党内问题或是党外问题，也不应该唯成分论地光看某些右倾机会主义的代表人物的阶级出身，而应该看右倾机会主义思想产生的社会阶级根源以及它所反映的阶级利益。在现阶段的我国，害怕社会主义建设事业大跃进，害怕党领导的群众革命运动，害怕人民公社化运动的正是资产阶级和代表资产阶级势力的人，其中坚持资本主义立场的人，总是对这些运动或公开抗拒、或大发牢骚、或吹毛求疵，挖空心思地想办法拉革命群众运动的后腿，好延长资产阶级的寿命。右倾机会主义分子对总路线、对大跃进、对人民公社化运动的进攻，正是反映了资产阶级的立场观点和思想情绪，这是资产阶级思想在党内的反映，是两条道路斗争在党内的反映。
    正当全国人民热烈响应党的战斗号召坚决与右倾机会主义展开斗争的时候，出现了阶级斗争终结的论调，这主要是表明这么两个问题：第一，有些坚决反党、反人民、反社会主义的阶级异己分子，目前正在鼓吹阶级斗争终结的幌子下，大搞阶级斗争，进行不可告人的阴谋破坏活动，对于这种人，我们必须提高警惕，坚决与他们展开斗争。第二，另有一些散布这种荒谬论调的人，或其本人就是右倾机会主义分子，企图借此来缓和阶级斗争，实质上为资本主义复辟开辟道路；或因为患了右倾麻痹病，或因为知识分子的劣根性作祟，惧怕和厌倦阶级斗争，惧怕和厌倦通过阶级斗争的洗礼进行思想改造；或因为只钻业务忘记政治，钻进只专不红的死胡同里去，因而对我国阶级斗争的现实熟视无睹，甚至恨不得早日结束阶级斗争与思想改造，对于这些人，我们要向他们大喝一声：同志，你错了，赶快猛醒过来吧！
    由于违背我国阶级斗争的活生生的现实，由于违背马克思列宁主义关于阶级和阶级斗争的基本原理，“阶级斗争终结论”在理论上是错误的，在政治上是有害的。散布这种观点，是有利于一切反社会主义势力所蓄意进行的反对无产阶级及其政党的阶级斗争；散布这种观点，不利于加强人民的革命警惕性，反而助长麻痹大意，使一部分人从思想上对阶级斗争解除武装；散布这种观点，模糊了人们对右倾机会主义的阶级本质及其危害性的认识。总之，“阶级斗争终结论”是根本要不得的东西，我们必须彻底批判这种货色、抵制这种货色，让它找不到一个市场和一个顾客，迫使“阶级斗争终结论”早日收摊。
