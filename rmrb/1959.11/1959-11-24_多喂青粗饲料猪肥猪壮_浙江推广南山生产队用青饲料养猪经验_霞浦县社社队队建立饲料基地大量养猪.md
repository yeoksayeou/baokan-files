    Feed More Green and Coarse Fodder to Make Pigs Fat and Strong
    Zhejiang Promotes the Experience of Nanshan Production Team in Raising Pigs with Green Fodder
    Xia浦 County's Communes and Teams Establish Fodder Bases to Raise Pigs in Large Numbers
    (Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 23rd dispatch) The Nanshan Production Team of the Xihu People's Commune in Hangzhou is using green and coarse fodder to raise pigs, becoming a banner on the pig-raising production front in Zhejiang Province.
    This year, the Nanshan Team raised a total of 1,965 pigs, averaging 4.55 pigs per person and 7.75 pigs per mu of cultivated land. All pig feed is solved through self-reliance. So many pigs are raised mainly on green fodder, supplemented with a small amount of fine bran, wheat bran, bean dregs, and other concentrated feeds. The pigs raised by this team using green fodder are all fat and strong. The fat pigs sold to the state this year all weighed over 130 jin, and many weighed over 200 jin. These large fat pigs were raised with 70% green fodder and 30% fine bran and bean dregs. They generally grow to 300 jin in 14 months.
    The experience of the Nanshan Team in raising both fat and numerous pigs using green and coarse fodder is being promoted throughout Zhejiang Province.
    The experience of the Nanshan Team in feeding large fat pigs with green and coarse fodder proves that strengthening the Party's leadership, adhering to putting politics in command, and launching mass movements are the keys to solving the problem of collecting fodder. This team encountered many ideological obstacles in raising pigs. Some people said, "It's difficult to find feed for one pig, let alone raising more." Others believed that "It's hard to raise pigs even with rice bran, let alone with green grass and leaves." After studying these situations, the Nanshan Team's Party branch extensively and deeply publicized the policy of developing pig production mainly with green and coarse fodder. At the same time, Ding Jinquan, the branch secretary, led Party members and Youth League members to collect green fodder up and down the mountains and in the water, conducting pig-raising experiments. As a result, more than 100 pigs fed with over 80% green fodder grew fast and had good physiques, generally reaching over 120 jin in eight months of feeding. Therefore, the Party branch organized a site visit for the commune members. The commune members saw the concrete facts of feeding large fat pigs with green fodder, and the conservative idea that pigs could not be raised without rice and wheat bran was resolved, and the fear of difficulty in finding green fodder was also overcome. Thus, they self-reliantly engaged in green fodder in a big way, and the number of pigs raised by the whole team increased day by day.
    The Nanshan Team's commune members have tried every means to engage in green and coarse fodder in a big way and have explored a set of methods that are more, faster, better, and more economical. That is, everyone takes action to plant, raise, collect, cut, salvage, pick up, and store. This year, the Nanshan Team established a 60-mu fodder base and organized a fodder professional team to plant high-yield fodder crops such as Canna edulis, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, and radishes. All the team's ponds and ditches were also fully utilized to raise revolutionary grass, water hyacinth, and other aquatic plants. The team organized women and children to collect green fodder such as wild grass, wild vegetables, and wild fruits everywhere by cutting on the mountains, picking up in the fields, and salvaging in the water. At the same time, red flag competitions were launched between groups and individuals. In this way, the source of green fodder became wider and wider, and more and more was collected. In addition to daily feeding of pigs, the green and coarse fodder planted and collected by the Nanshan Team's commune members also paid attention to ensiling or dry storage. At present, the whole team has stored more than 300,000 jin of green fodder, plus the high-yield fodder that will be harvested soon, the whole team has prepared enough fodder for the pigs to overwinter.
    In the large-scale pig raising mainly with green and coarse fodder, the Nanshan Team also paid great attention to strengthening feed management and improving feeding methods, so as to achieve reasonable feeding, careful feeding of coarse fodder, fermentation feeding of green fodder, and mixed feeding of multiple fodders. Pay attention to cutting finely, crushing, and cooking thoroughly to make the pigs like to eat and prevent waste and loss. Feeders and commune members also rationally matched feeds according to the different situations of meat pigs, sows, and piglets. Meat pigs generally use 85% green fodder and 15% coarse fodder and fine bran; the coarse fodder and fine bran for sows are appropriately increased to 20%-25%, and some bean dregs, wheat bran, and other concentrated feeds are appropriately fed during pregnancy and lactation; green fodder ratio is also gradually increased for piglets, so that it develops the habit of eating green fodder.
    The Nanshan Team is currently engaged in the storage of green and coarse fodder and is preparing to continue to develop the pig-raising industry.
    (Our newspaper, Fuzhou, 23rd dispatch) Xia浦 County, Fujian, implements the principle of "green fodder as the main and concentrated feed as the auxiliary," adopts various methods such as "planting on the ground, raising on the pond surface, salvaging in the sea, and collecting in the mountains," and mobilizes communes and teams to establish year-round feed bases, which has greatly promoted the development of pig production.
    Xia浦 County, backed by mountains and facing the sea, has abundant green fodder resources. In order to solve the problem of pig feed, the establishment of feed bases was grasped from the county to the brigade as early as this spring. All 155 pig farms in the county's communes allocated 20 to 30 mu of land to plant sweet potatoes, miscellaneous grains, pumpkins, and high-yield fodder crops. At present, the county has planted 5,000 mu of fodder crops. They also made full use of ponds and swamps to establish floating duckweed-like feed bases and propagated water hyacinth and duckweed in large quantities. At present, the county has raised 300 mu of water hyacinth and 500 mu of duckweed, with an annual output of 200,000 dan, which can feed 20,000 to 30,000 pigs for a year.
    The communes and production brigades along the coast also use the beaches to establish natural feed bases and collect more than a dozen kinds of marine feeds such as rich green moss, mudskippers, seagrass, and small yellow croakers. Since the beginning of this year, the county has salvaged millions of dan of marine feed, and a batch of green moss has also been transferred to support brother counties such as Fu'an and Ningde.
    The communes and production brigades in mountainous and hilly areas plan to collect wild feed as an important source for solving pig feed. There are more than 100 kinds of green feed, such as red-headed vegetables, milk grass, and goose pond grass, produced on the local mountains. Among them, piglet vegetables are rich in nutrition, which can increase milk juice when used to feed sows; feeding piglets can promote fattening. These wild feeds can be harvested for eight months a year, and each labor force can harvest hundreds of jin a day. In addition, peanuts vines, sweet potato vines and leaves are also widely used as feed.
    The reason why the establishment of feed bases in Xia浦 County has been done so well is mainly because the county party committee has strengthened leadership and launched mass movements in a big way. Li Yue, the first secretary of the county party committee, personally went to the countryside to conduct pilot projects, studied with the masses to solve the problem of pig feed, vigorously mobilized the masses to pick according to the growing season of various feeds, held on-site meetings to publicize and promote various experiences, and introduced high-yield and high-quality green feeds. While grasping the collective planting and collection of feed by communes and teams, it also encouraged commune members to use sporadic vacant land in front of and behind their houses to plant fodder crops.
    For the planting and collection of feed, they adopted a combination of professional teams and surprise movements. Regular feed production is the responsibility of professional teams; for seasonal feeds with relatively strong seasonality, such as collecting wild pig vegetables and sea green moss, surprise movements are carried out, and thousands of troops and horses go up the mountains and down to the sea to collect.
    After taking the above measures, Xia浦 County ensured the needs of the great development of pig production. Recently, the county party committee called on all localities to carry out the green silage movement, put forward the slogan "Secretaries take action, everyone picks," and has transported back 30,000 to 40,000 dan of sweet potato peels in recent days.

    In the development of pig production, Muyang Commune, Suiyang County, a mountainous area on the border of Guizhou Province, has set aside some land as a feed base. The feeders generally adopted intercropping and interplanting in the fields, so as to make the best use of the land and keep it evergreen in all seasons, so that pigs can often eat fresh feed.

    本报杭州23日电　杭州西湖人民公社南山生产队用青粗饲料养猪，成为浙江省养猪生产战线上一面旗帜。
    南山队今年共养猪一千九百六十五头，平均每人养四点五五头，每亩耕地有猪七点七五头，猪饲料全部自力更生解决。饲养这么多的猪都是以青饲料为主，配掺小部分细糠、麸皮、豆腐渣等精饲料。这个队用青饲料养猪，头头肥壮。今年出售给国家的大肥猪都在一百三十斤以上，有不少的猪重二百多斤。这些大肥猪是用70％的青饲料和30％的细糠、豆腐渣养大的，一般养十四个月就长到三百斤。
    南山队用青粗饲料把猪养得又肥又多的经验，正在浙江省推广。
    南山队用青粗饲料喂大肥猪的经验证明：加强党的领导、坚持政治挂帅、大搞群众运动，是解决采集饲料问题的关键。这个队养猪曾碰到很多思想障碍，有人说：“养一头猪饲料都难办，养多了更办不到”；有的认为“米糠都难喂大，青草树叶喂猪更白搭”。南山队党支部研究了这些情况后，一面在队里广泛深入地宣传以青粗饲料为主的发展养猪生产方针，一面由支部书记丁金泉带领党团员上山下水，采集青饲料，进行养猪试验。结果用80％以上青饲料喂养的一百多头猪，长肉快，体质好，一般饲养八个月就达一百二十多斤重。于是党支部就组织社员现场参观。社员们亲眼看到青饲料喂出大肥猪的具体事实，原来认为没有米、麦糠养不大猪的保守思想解决了，青饲料找不到的畏难情绪也克服了，于是自力更生地大搞青饲料，全队养猪数量也就天天增加。
    南山队社员千方百计大搞青粗饲料，已摸索出一套多快好省的办法，这就是人人动手种、养、采、割、捞、拾、藏。南山队今年建立了六十亩饲料基地，组织了饲料专业队，种植下蕉藕、南瓜、番薯（甘薯）、萝卜等高产饲料作物；队里所有的池塘、水沟，也充分利用起来，放养了革命草、水浮莲等水草。队里组织妇女、儿童采取山上割、地里拾、水里捞等办法，到处采集野草、野菜、野果等青饲料。同时展开了组与组、人与人之间的红旗竞赛。这样青饲料来源就越来越广，越集越多。南山队社员们种植和采集的青粗饲料，除了日常喂猪外，还注意青储或干藏。目前全队已储藏好青饲料三十多万斤，加上即将收的高产饲料，全队已经备足了猪过冬的饲料。
    南山队在以青粗饲料为主大量养猪中，还十分注意加强饲料管理，改进饲养方法，做到合理喂料、粗料细喂、青料发酵喂、多料混喂，注意切细、打碎、煮熟，作到使猪爱吃，又防止浪费损失。饲养员和社员们还根据肉猪、母猪和小猪等不同情况，合理搭配饲料。肉猪一般用85％的青饲料和15％的粗料、细糠；母猪的粗料、细糠适当增加到20％—25％，在怀孕和喂奶期间适当喂些豆渣、麸皮等精饲料；也逐步给小猪增加青饲料比例，使它养成爱吃青饲料的习惯。
    南山队目前正在大搞青粗饲料储藏工作，准备继续发展养猪事业。
    本报福州23日电　福建霞浦县贯彻以青饲料为主、精料为辅的方针，采取“地上种、池面养、海里捞、山中采”等多种办法，发动社社队队建立常年饲料基地，大大促进了养猪生产的发展。
    霞浦县背山面海，青饲料资源十分丰富。为解决养猪饲料问题，早在今年春季从县到大队都大抓建立饲料基地工作。全县各公社的一百五十五个养猪场都拨出二、三十亩的土地种植番薯、杂粮、南瓜和高产饲料作物。目前全县已种饲料作物五千亩。他们还充分利用池塘沼地建立浮萍类饲料基地，大量繁殖水浮莲和浮萍。目前全县已养水浮莲三百亩，浮萍五百亩，年产量二十万担，可供二、三万头猪吃一年的。
    在沿海的各公社、生产大队也都利用海滩建立天然的饲料基地，搜集海面上丰富的青苔、跳鱼、草下狮菜、小黄鱼等十多种海洋饲料。今年以来全县已捞集海洋饲料几百万担，有一批海青苔还调往支援福安、宁德等兄弟县。
    在山区和丘陵地带的公社、生产大队都有计划地采集野生饲料，作为解决养猪饲料的重要来源。当地山上产有红头菜、奶草、鹅塘草等一百多种青饲料，其中猪仔菜营养丰富，用来喂母猪能增加奶汁；喂小猪能促进长膘。这些野生饲料一年可采摘八个月，每个劳力一天可采成百斤。此外各地还广泛利用花生藤、番薯藤叶等作饲料。
    霞浦县建立饲料基地工作所以搞得好，主要是县委加强领导，大搞群众运动。县委第一书记李岳亲自下乡搞试点，和群众一起研究解决养猪饲料的办法，根据各种饲料生长季节，大力发动群众采摘，召开现场会议宣传推广各种经验，介绍高产优质的青饲料。在大抓社队集体种植和采集饲料的同时，还鼓励社员利用屋前屋后零星空地种植饲料作物。
    对于饲料的种植和采集，他们采取了专业队和突击运动相结合的办法。经常性的饲料生产，由专业队负责；如采集野猪菜、海青苔等季节性比较强烈的饲料，则开展突击运动，千军万马上山下海采集。
    采取以上措施后，霞浦县保证了养猪生产大发展的需要。最近县委又号召各地开展青贮饲料运动，提出“书记动手，人人采摘”的口号，连日来已运回三、四万担番薯皮。（附图片）
    贵州省边沿山区的绥阳县募阳公社，在发展养猪生产中，公社辟出了一些土地作为饲料基地。饲养员们在地里普遍采取了间作套种，做到地尽其力，四季常青，使猪经常能吃到新鲜的饲料。新华社记者
