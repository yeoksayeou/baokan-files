Xinhua News Agency, October 31st. The representatives of the National "Heroes' Assembly," in their speeches today, introduced the achievements of various regions and fronts in launching mass movements under the leadership of the Party, and enthusiastically praised the great victory of the Party's mass line.

The heads of the Shanghai, Shaanxi, and Hubei delegations to the Assembly, using extremely rich and vivid examples, illustrated that, as a result of adhering to the General Line and vigorously launching mass movements, these regions have seen the emergence of tens of thousands of advanced producers, the continuous improvement of the class consciousness of the workers, and a surging upsurge of the campaign to increase production and practice economy.

Zhong Min, head of the Shanghai delegation, said in his speech that, because the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China firmly and unswervingly followed the direction pointed out by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and, in accordance with the political and economic situation and the development of mass movements at different periods, promptly put forward specific guidelines and requirements for vigorously launching mass movements, and strengthened leadership, the mass campaign for increasing production and practicing economy has been able to continue, with each wave higher than the last. This year, Shanghai's total industrial output value from January to September increased by 47.6% compared with the same period last year, and the amount of investment completed in capital construction by the end of September was close to completing the annual state plan. The volume of freight transport also broke the highest record in history, and the market is also experiencing booming buying and selling. The city's two million workers guarantee to fulfill the annual state plan ahead of schedule and in an all-round way. Zhong Min said: "The common slogan of the Shanghai workers is: 'How much the state wants us to produce, that's how much we'll produce, only more, not less; when the state wants us to deliver, that's when we'll deliver, only faster, not slower; the state wants us to produce things of good quality, that's what we'll do, only better, never worse.'"

Wang Lin, head of the Shaanxi delegation, said that the mass movement on the economic front in Shaanxi Province this year has greatly improved compared with 1958. Summarized, there are five characters, namely "All, Detail, Real, Abundant, Good." "All" means the comprehensive leap forward of more, faster, better, and more economical; "Detail" means in-depth and meticulous work; "Real" means solid and concrete measures; "Abundant" means rich and colorful, with a variety of competition forms; "Good" means the great rise of the communist spirit of cooperation, and the great support for advanced elements to help the backward. Wang Lin pointed out that the great improvement of the mass movement has formed a magnificent momentum of "boosting morale again and again, and striving for the upstream again and again" on the economic front in Shaanxi Province.

Chen Kedong, head of the Hubei delegation, said that since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the ranks of advanced producers in Hubei Province have expanded to more than 100,000 people, and there are more than 5,000 advanced collectives. In the past year or more, more than one million rationalization proposals have been put forward in the province, and the technical innovation and technical revolution movements are flourishing and developing. He pointed out that the most essential reason why we have been able to achieve continuous leap forward is that, under the guidance of the General Line, we have combined objective possibilities with subjective initiative, and maximized the role of people's subjective initiative.

The universal development of the communist cooperative spirit of "taking difficulties for oneself and giving convenience to others" is an important feature of the current mass movement. Communist large-scale cooperation is flourishing and developing within enterprises, between enterprises, between departments, and between regions. Sun Chunhe, stationmaster of Fuxin Railway Station, said that in the fiery mass movement, railway workers cooperated with workers in mines and other consignment departments, and various jobs, procedures, and links closely cooperated, so that a train of freight cars, from empty cars to loaded cars, would not stay for more than four hours, shortening the time by more than half compared with ordinary trains. Shen Dezhen, a switchboard operator in the long-distance telephone department of the Chongqing Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, said that long-distance calls between Chongqing and Beijing used to often fail to get through because of poor cooperation between switchboard operators at both ends, and some users called long-distance calls "long waiting calls." Since the launch of the "one-stop" mass cooperation movement, the work efficiency of switchboard operators at both ends has rapidly increased by 50%, and they have been continuously praised by users. In the second and third quarters of this year, the Beijing-Chongqing line long-distance telephone group has continuously won the title of "Red Flag Circuit."

With the widespread and in-depth development of mass movements on the economic front, the experience of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" is playing an increasingly important role. Peng Yingbei, a technician at the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, said that in the torrent of large-scale mass movements, the First Automobile Plant launched a vigorous technical innovation movement in which workers participated in design, and "three-combination" groups combining leading cadres, technicians, and workers were established in batches. Under the joint efforts of the "three-combination" group members and the vast number of workers in the foundry workshop where he worked, after more than a year of hard work and experimentation, a series of revolutionary improvements were made to more than 20 major equipment, making the foundry workshop, which was originally the weakest link in the entire factory, the most advanced part.

Thousands of advanced producers are the vanguards of socialist construction and the leaders of mass movements. At today's meeting, advanced producers from various fronts continued to report their new achievements to the Party and the state, and expressed their determination to continue to lead the vast number of workers to create even greater achievements.

Li Fuxiang, a driller at the Shanghai Boiler Factory, enthusiastically responded to the Party's call to fight, repeatedly revising the leap forward plan in this year's continued great leap forward, and put forward the goal of working for sixteen years in one year. Today, Li Fuxiang reported to the Assembly that by October 15, he had completed 39 technical innovations and completed sixteen years and ten months of work, achieving the guarantee he made to the Party ahead of schedule. Although Lu Fengchun, a worker at the calcium carbide factory of Jilin Chemical Industry Company, had only attended school for three years, he, with the support of the Party and his comrades, and after painstaking research and continuous experimentation for several days and nights, finally innovated the production process of phosphorus trichloride, which is technically complex, so that the factory where he worked could produce 1,000 tons more of phosphorus trichloride this year. These phosphorus trichloride can be made into 1,443 tons of pesticides, ensuring that more than 953,000 mu of farmland will not suffer reduced yields due to pests. Lu Fengchun said that now, the products of Jilin Chemical Industry Company are supplying the needs of 24 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country, and all employees of the company are determined to redouble their efforts and contribute all their strength to the chemicalization of agriculture.

The "May Fourth" Youth Drilling Rig of the Hunan Chenxian Geological Team, which was rated as a national advanced drilling rig as early as 1956, was reported to the Assembly today by their captain, Wang Guoji, about their latest achievements. Wang Guoji said that in the past three years and two months, they have completed nearly twelve years of work, and are now doing the work for 1967. From January to September this year, they have created a high-yield record of advancing 1,000 meters per day for four consecutive times. Zhang Zhian, head of the General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Railway Corps delegation, introduced that the total mileage of railway construction undertaken by the Railway Corps in 1958 was 300 kilometers more than the total mileage of construction in the First Five-Year Plan. This year, fighting together on various new railway lines, the Railway Corps soldiers and the civilian workers continue to create new miracles, with investments completed from January to September increasing by 42% compared to the same period last year. Zhang Zhian said that under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, all our officers and soldiers are determined to fight with the spirit of "making mountains bow their heads and rivers make way" for the high-speed development of China's railway industry.

Today, Li Jiebo, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Yin Weichen, Director of the Huangtugang People's Commune in Beijing, spoke at the meeting; Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, delivered a congratulatory speech to the meeting.

Also speaking at today's meeting were Wei Hongshun, representative of the Tongjialiang Store in Datong City, Shanxi; Xu Xuehui, accountant of the Nongba Business Office of the Longchuan State-owned Farm of the People's Bank of China in Ruili County, Yunnan; Wang Shuqin, switchboard operator of the Guiyang Postal and Telecommunications Bureau; Yu Pei, director of the Jinbei Meteorological Observatory in Shanxi; Yang Yuwen, chief engineer of Tianjin Renli Woolen Textile Factory; Shi Chuanxiang, a scavenger from the Dongcheng District Cleaning Team in Beijing; Sun Defu, drilling team leader of the Exploration Company of Yumen Petroleum Administration Bureau; Mo Jiarui, captain of the Jiangxia Steamer of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration Bureau; Wang Jinxian, captain of the Youth Shock Team of the Dam Construction Branch of the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau; Guan Xinyang, director of the Xiagang Grain Management Office in Kaiping County, Guangdong; Wang Cai, representative of the Second Delegation of the Central Directly Subordinated Departments; Chen Qirong, hoisting team leader of Baogang Metal Structure Company; Gao Wanchun, chairman of the trade union of Yingkou Paper Mill in Liaoning; and Bai Lin, representative of Anshan Power Supply Bureau.

    群英会上歌颂党的群众路线的胜利
    做群众运动带头人
    李颉伯、殷维臣讲话陈叔通致贺词
    新华社31日讯　全国“群英会”代表在今天大会的发言中，介绍了各地区、各条战线在党的领导下大搞群众运动的成果，热烈地歌颂了党的群众路线的伟大胜利。
    出席大会的上海市、陕西省和湖北省代表团团长，用极其丰富的生动事例，说明了这些地区由于坚持总路线，坚持大搞群众运动的结果，成千成万的先进生产者涌现出来，职工群众阶级觉悟不断提高，增产节约高潮正滚滚向前。
    上海市代表团团长钟民在发言中说，由于中共上海市委坚定不移地沿着党中央和毛主席所指明的方向，根据不同时期的政治经济形势和群众运动的发展情况，及时地提出了大搞群众运动的具体方针和要求，加强领导，因而使群众性的增产节约运动能够持续地一浪高过一浪。今年，上海市1至9月的工业总产值比去年同期增长了47.6％，基本建设完成的投资额到9月底已经接近完成全年国家计划，交通运输的货运量打破了历史上的最高纪录，市场也是购销两旺。全市两百万职工保证提前全面完成今年的国家计划。钟民说：“我们上海职工的共同口号是：国家要我们生产多少，就生产多少，只多不少；国家要我们什么时候交货，就在什么时候交货，只快不慢；国家要我们生产怎样好的东西，就怎样好，只好不坏。”
    陕西省代表团团长王林说，今年陕西省经济战线上的群众运动比1958年又大大地提高了。概括起来有五个字，即“全、细、实、丰、好”。全就是多快好省的全面跃进；细就是工作深入细致；实就是扎扎实实，措施具体；丰就是丰富多采，竞赛形式多种多样；好就是共产主义协作之风大涨，先进帮助落后的劲头大举。王林指出，群众运动的大大提高，在陕西全省经济战线上形成了“干劲一鼓再鼓、上游一争再争”的磅礴气势。
    湖北省代表团团长陈克东说，从1958年大跃进到现在，湖北全省先进生产者的队伍已扩大到十万多人，先进集体有五千多个。一年多来，全省提出的合理化建议达到一百多万条，技术革新和技术革命运动正在蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。他指出，我们所以能够取得不断跃进的伟大胜利，最本质的原因就是在总路线的指引下，把客观可能性同主观能动性结合起来，最大限度地发挥了人的主观能动作用。
    “困难归自己，方便给别人”的共产主义协作思想的普遍发扬，是当前群众运动的一个重要特点。共产主义的大协作正在企业内部、企业之间、部门之间和地区之间蓬勃发展。阜新车站站长孙春和介绍说，在火热的群众运动中，铁路职工同矿山和其他托运部门的职工共同协作，各工种、各工序和各个环节密切配合，使一列货车从空车到装满重车开出，停留时间不超过四小时，比一般列车缩短了一半以上。重庆市邮电局长途电话科话务员申德贞说，重庆北京之间的长途电话过去因为两端话务员协作不好，常常叫不通，有的用户把长途电话叫做长等电话。自从“一条龙”群众性大协作运动开展后，两端话务员的工作效率迅速提高了50％，不断得到用户表扬。今年二、三季，京渝线长途电话小组连续获得“红旗电路”的称号。
    随着经济战线上群众运动的广泛深入发展，“两参一改三结合”的经验正在发挥越来越大的作用。长春第一汽车制造厂技术员彭映倍说，第一汽车厂在大规模的群众运动的洪流中，曾经展开了一个轰轰烈烈的工人参加设计的技术革新运动，领导干部、技术人员和工人相结合的“三结合”小组成批地建立。他所在的铸工车间在“三结合”小组成员和广大职工的共同努力下，经过一年多的奋战和试验，把二十多台主要设备进行了一系列革命性的改进，使原来是全厂薄弱环节的铸工车间变成了最先进的部分。
    万千先进生产者是社会主义建设的尖兵和群众运动的带头人。在今天的大会上，来自各个战线上的先进生产者，继续向党和国家汇报他们的新成就，并且表示了他们要继续带动广大职工创造更大成绩的决心。
    上海锅炉厂钻工李福祥热烈响应党的战斗号召，在今年继续大跃进中一再修改跃进计划，提出了一年要做出十六年工作量的奋斗目标。今天，李福祥向大会报捷说：到10月15日止，他已经实现了三十九项技术革新，完成十六年零十个月的工作量，提前实现了向党提出的保证。吉林化学工业公司电石厂工人吕凤春虽然只念过三年书，但是他在党和同志们的支持下，经过刻苦钻研和几个昼夜的连续试验，终于革新了技术很复杂的三氯化磷的生产过程，使他所在的工厂今年可以多生产三氯化磷一千吨。这些三氯化磷能做成农药一千四百四十三吨，保证九十五万三千多亩农田可以不致因为虫害而减产。吕凤春说，现在，吉林化学工业公司的产品供应着全国二十四个省、市、自治区的需要，全公司职工决心鼓足更大干劲，为农业的化学化贡献他们的全部力量。
    早在1956年就被评为全国先进钻机的湖南郴县地质队“五四”青年号钻机，今天由他们的机长王国骥向大会报告了他们的最新成绩。王国骥说，在过去的三年零两个月里，他们已经完成了将近十二年的工作量，现在已在做1967年的活。今年1至9月份，他们又连续四次创造了日进千米的高产纪录。中国人民解放军总后勤部和铁道兵代表团团长张治安介绍说，1958年铁道兵部队担负的铁路施工总里程，比第一个五年计划施工里程的总和还多三百公里。今年，战斗在各条新建铁路线上的铁道兵战士和民工一起，继续创造着新的奇迹，1至9月份完成的投资比去年同期增长42％。张治安说，我们全体官兵在党和毛主席的英明领导下，决心以“让高山低头，河水让路”的气魄，为高速度发展我国铁路事业而奋斗。
    今天，中华全国总工会副主席李颉伯和北京市黄土岗人民公社主任殷维臣，在大会上讲了话；全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通向大会致贺词。
    在今天大会上发言的，还有山西大同市同家梁商店代表魏洪顺，云南瑞丽县人民银行陇川国营农场弄巴营业所会计员徐学惠，贵阳市邮电局话务员王淑琴，山西晋北气象台台长余佩，天津仁立毛纺厂总工程师杨玉文，北京市崇文区清洁队粪便清除工人时传祥，玉门石油管理局勘探公司钻井队长孙德福，长江航运管理局江峡轮船长莫家瑞，三门峡工程局筑坝一分局青年突击队长王进先，广东开平县蚬岗粮食管理所主任关新扬，中央直属部门第二代表团代表王才，包钢金属结构公司吊装组长陈启荣，辽宁营口造纸厂工会主席高万春，鞍山供电局代表白琳。
