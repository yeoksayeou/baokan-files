Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th—The U.S. Supreme Court yesterday brazenly issued a ruling forcing 500,000 steelworkers to return to work.

　　After a four-day hearing on the appeal of the Steelworkers Union, the Supreme Court yesterday rejected the union's appeal, announcing that the order issued by the Federal Court at the request of U.S. President Eisenhower to force steelworkers to return to work for eighty days would take effect immediately. The Supreme Court's judgment stated that the order forcing striking steelworkers to return to work was "well-founded" "because the strike endangered national security." Of the nine justices on the Supreme Court, one justice, Douglas, disagreed with the ruling. Douglas pointed out that there was no basis for stopping the strike on the pretext of national "health and safety."

　　This ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court was expected, and it further exposes the class nature of the bourgeois judiciary. Eisenhower immediately issued a statement after the Supreme Court's ruling, expressing satisfaction with the ruling. Cooper, the chief negotiator for the steel monopolists, happily announced yesterday that steel companies would immediately take steps to reopen factories.

　　Under the combined pressure of the U.S. executive and judicial authorities, David McDonald, president of the United Steelworkers of America, has ordered a return to work. However, steelworkers and other American workers are extremely angry at this act of strike suppression by the American authorities. John Yiscat, a pipe fitter at the U.S. Steel Corporation in Pittsburgh, said: "The government can force me to go back to the factory, but no one—not even President Eisenhower himself and the Supreme Court—can make me say I am happy about it."

　　This major strike of 500,000 steelworkers is the longest steel strike in American history. It started on July 15th and has lasted for 116 days as of yesterday, demonstrating the tenacious fighting spirit of the American working class. The steel company bosses had expected that hunger would force the workers to submit, but this plan completely failed. In the end, the Eisenhower government had to abandon its initial pretense of "non-intervention" and openly came forward to stop the strike.

　　The strike caused huge losses to American steel monopolists. Reports indicate that during the 116-day strike, 310 steel plants and 118 iron mines across the country stopped production, and steel companies lost approximately $5 billion in production. The strike also cost the U.S. federal government $1.2 billion in tax revenue. It is estimated that after the resumption of work, it will take another thirty to forty days for steel production to fully recover.

　　During the strike, steelworkers also broke through the united front of the capitalists and forced three steel companies to accept the workers' conditions.

### 美最高法院悍然判决  强迫钢铁工人复工

    美最高法院悍然判决
    强迫钢铁工人复工
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：美国最高法院昨天悍然作出决定，强迫五十万钢铁工人复工。
    最高法院对钢铁工会的上诉进行了四天的审理以后昨天驳回了工会方面的上诉，宣布联邦法院应美国总统艾森豪威尔的要求而下的强迫钢铁工人复工八十天的命令立即生效。最高法院的判决书中竟说强迫钢铁罢工工人复工的命令“有充分的根据”，“因为这次罢工危害了国家安全”。在最高法院九个法官中有一个法官道格拉斯不同意这项判决。道格拉斯指出，借口国家的“健康和安全”制止这次罢工是没有根据的。
    美国最高法院这一判决是在意料之中的，它进一步暴露了资产阶级司法机构的阶级本质。艾森豪威尔在最高法院判决之后立即发表声明，对这一判决表示满意。钢铁垄断资本家的首席谈判代表库伯昨天高兴地宣布，钢铁公司将立即采取步骤重新开厂。
    在美国行政和司法当局的联合压迫下，美国联合钢铁工人工会主席麦克唐纳已经下令复工。但是钢铁工人和美国其他工人对美国当局这一镇压罢工的行为极为愤慨。匹兹堡美国钢铁公司的管道装配工人约翰·易斯卡特说：“政府可以强迫我回到工厂去，但是，没有人——即使是艾森豪威尔总统本人和最高法院——能够使我说我对此感到愉快。”
    这一次五十万钢铁工人的大罢工是美国历史上最长的一次钢铁罢工，从7月15日开始，到昨天为止已经坚持了一百一十六天，它显示了美国工人阶级顽强的战斗精神。钢铁公司的老板们曾经预计饥饿将使工人屈服，但是这种打算完全失败了。最后艾森豪威尔政府不得不抛弃了最初假装的“不干预”姿态，公开出面制止罢工。
    这次罢工使美国钢铁垄断资本家遭到巨大的损失。有消息说，在一百一十六天的罢工期间，全国有三百一十个钢厂、一百一十八个铁矿停止了生产，钢铁公司的生产损失了五十亿美元左右。罢工还使美国联邦政府损失税收十二亿美元。据估计，在复工以后，还需要三、四十天才能使钢铁生产全面恢复。
    在罢工期间钢铁工人还突破了资本家的联合阵线，迫使三家钢铁公司接受了工人的条件。
