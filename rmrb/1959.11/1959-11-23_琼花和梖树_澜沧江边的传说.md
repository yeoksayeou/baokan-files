Pearl Flower and 梖 Tree
—A Legend by the Lancang River
Chen Guipei
　　The Lancang River is like an arrow shot from a crossbow,
　　Cutting the Xishuangbanna basin into two pieces,
　　A tree grows with every gust of wind,
　　Fine raindrops scatter all over the tree,
　　Turning into flowers to rest on the tree's waist,
　　Each flower has its own legend,
　　Each leaf has its own ode written on it.
　　Legend has it that the pearl flower is a shy beauty in the forest,
　　Her lover is the brightest star in the blue sky,
　　She stands in the Lancang River every night, gazing at the sky,
　　Her hands pluck the strings of the stream,
　　The forest is filled with a tinkling sound! Clang! Clang!
　　The stars, hearing the sound of the zither, fall into the river,
　　The beauty slowly loosens her dress,
　　Unfortunately, the water ripples slightly,
　　The stars escape without a trace,
　　The beauty also hides shyly in the green leaves.
　　It is said that the 梖 tree was a monk, (Note 1)
　　Following Gutama in his practice under the Bodhi tree, (Note 2)
　　To conquer the demons, Gutama,
　　Wrote various strategies on the monk's cassock.
　　One day Gutama ordered the monk,
　　To carry ten thousand volumes of scriptures,
　　And return to his relatives by the Lancang River,
　　Unfortunately, a demon killed him on the way,
　　His body turned into a 梖 tree,
　　Standing there waiting for his relatives,
　　As long as you pick a 梖 leaf,
　　The Dai people’s scriptures are written on it. (Note 3)

Note:
　　(1) The 梖 tree is a unique tall tree in Xishuangbanna, resembling a palm tree, but with larger leaves. The Dai people pick 梖 leaves and engrave many poems and scriptures on them for preservation.
　　(2) Gutama is the Buddha of the Dai people.
　　(3) The scriptures are poems recorded by the Dai people on 梖 leaves, preserved in Buddhist temples as chanting scriptures.

    琼花和梖树
    ——澜沧江边的传说
    陈贵培
    澜沧江像射出的一只弩箭，
    把西双版纳的坝子割成两片，
    大风刮一次树木长一棵，
    点点细雨满树飘，
    化作花朵歇树腰，
    每一朵花都有自己的传说
    每一片叶子上写着自己的赞歌。
    传说琼花是森林中含羞的美人，
    她的情人就是蓝天里最亮的星朵，
    她每夜站在澜沧江中凝视天空
    双手拨起溪水的琴弦
    森林里到处响得叮叮！咚咚！
    星星听了琴声就跌落在江中，
    美人就慢慢撒开了衣襟，
    可惜水波微微闪动，
    星星就逃得无影无踪，
    美人也羞得躲到绿叶中。
    据说梖树是一个僧人，（一）
    跟着古达玛在菩提树下修行，（二）
    古达玛为了战胜群魔，
    在僧人袈裟上写下各种战略。
    一天古达玛命令僧人，
    背起万卷经书，
    回去传给澜沧江边的亲人，
    不幸途中恶魔将他害死，
    他的尸体变成一株梖树，
    站在那里等待亲人，
    只要摘下一片梖叶，
    上面就写着傣家的经文。（三）注：（一）梖树是西双版纳地特有的一种高大的树木，形象颇似棕树，但树大叶宽，傣族人民采摘梖叶，把许多诗歌经文，刻在上面保藏起来。
    （二）古达玛是傣族佛祖。
    （三）经文是傣族在梖叶上记载下来的诗歌，保存在佛寺里作为朗颂的经文。
