Invincible to Cannons, Unscattered by Typhoons
—Investigation of the People's Commune on the Three Islands of the Fujian Front

	In the forefront of Fujian Province, amidst the turbulent Taiwan Strait, lies a people's commune only 2,500 meters away from the island of Greater Jinmen, occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops - the frontline people's commune composed of the three islands of Dadeng, Xiaodeng, and Jiaoyu in Jinmen County.

	These three small islands, standing in the sea with low-lying terrain, have a total area of only six square kilometers. Since the nationwide liberation, the bandit troops entrenched in Greater Jinmen have constantly shelled the three islands, taking advantage of the high-ground topography. However, the heroic people of the three islands, seasoned by the flames of war, side-by-side with the garrison troops, defend the motherland's coast, turning the three islands into three sharp knives piercing the heart of Jinmen, constantly inflicting heavy blows on the Chiang bandit troops with fierce artillery fire; at the same time, they persist in production amidst the rain of bullets and smoke, vigorously building socialism.

	This commune, in nearly a year's time, has been subjected to more than 60,000 shells fired by the enemy troops, and has also experienced an extremely severe typhoon attack. The difficulties in production are unimaginable. But at present, the scene on the island is truly gratifying: the fields that have just harvested abundant soybeans, peanuts, early rice, and sorghum are now covered with the leafy, sprawling sweet potatoes and the sturdy stalks of late rice; the salt fields destroyed by炮弹are shining again with glittering salt crystals; in the strait within the range of artillery fire, ships shuttle back and forth, riding the wind and waves; the shipyard is working around the clock to repair the ships destroyed by artillery fire and typhoons. All this makes it hard to believe that this is a frontline island. The secretary of the commune party committee told us: "In the ten years of struggle against the enemy, last year's 'August 23rd' artillery battle was the fiercest, but our production, support for the front, and people's armed forces have never developed so rapidly and so powerfully as after the establishment of the commune!" The enemy's cannons cannot crush the people's commune, and the typhoon cannot scatter the people's commune. People use combat to defend production and use production to support combat. This is the impregnable three islands.

Great Leap Forward Amidst the Sound of Cannons

	At the commune party committee, we saw exciting figures: In the first half of this year, the total income of the commune was more than 830,000 yuan, an increase of 35% compared with the same period last year.

	The Three Islands Frontline People's Commune has a total of eight production brigades (six agricultural brigades, one shipping and transportation brigade, and one salt brigade), with more than 5,700 mu of cultivated land, of which more than 3,700 mu have been hit by more than 30,000 shells. This year, they encountered extremely unfavorable weather (excessive rainfall), but the production of the Three Islands Frontline People's Commune still achieved amazing results in the first half of 1959. Oyster farming is an important production on the three islands, and this year it has achieved a bumper harvest. The oyster meat production reached 1.12 million jin, an increase of 56% compared with 1958; the total income from wooden sailboat transportation was more than 310,000 yuan, an increase of 34% compared with 1958; the income from sideline occupations was more than 59,000 yuan, doubling the amount of the same period in 1958.

	Spring is the season for harvesting oysters. Most of the oysters are grown in the strait close to Jinmen. When the harvesting began, the infantry and militia organized armed protection at the front line, and the artillery was responsible for monitoring the enemy and protecting production. Continuous spring rains, surging waves, the commune members braved the wind and rain, struggling against the raging waves. They dispersed to the sea to rush harvest during the day, and concentrated in the sea to rush harvest at night. In this battle, the commune uniformly mobilized labor and tools, making production fast and good. The Nanxing Brigade could not finish harvesting 335,000 oyster seedlings with its own labor force, so it allocated 45,000 oyster seedlings to the Haiying Brigade. The shipping brigade and fishermen also drew out more than 20 small boats to support the oyster harvesting, replacing the heavy labor of carrying them from the sea to the shore by human power, one load at a time. This year, the harvest volume per person increased from 120 jin per tide in the past to 500 jin. People said: "This is the power of the people's commune."

	The busy spring plowing began, and the land was turned over by artillery shells. The masses joked: "Chiang Kai-shek is also responding to the call for deep plowing." According to the regulations that our army shells the Chiang bandit army on Jinmen on single-numbered days and does not shell on double-numbered days, the production team at the forefront could only work on double-numbered days in the past. After the establishment of the commune, they transferred to production teams with relatively hidden terrain to work on single-numbered days, and concentrated the labor force of several teams at night to make a breakthrough at the forefront. At the same time, they universally used air raid shelters and individual bunkers dug by the fields to deal with the enemy's artillery fire. They plowed the fields and sowed seeds during the day. When the enemy shelled, they drilled into the caves with their cattle and people. As soon as the shelling stopped, people immediately jumped out of the caves safely and continued spring plowing. In this way, the commune organized the strength of each brigade and carried out production in a planned way in the artillery fire, and successively filled more than 22,000 shell craters on more than 2,600 mu of cultivated land. All the more than 4,500 mu of land that could be cultivated were planted with crops.

	In terms of salt production, compared with the period of the people's commune and the advanced cooperative, the ability to resist disasters has been greatly strengthened. In the artillery battle on September 3, 1958, more than 700 mu of salt fields were destroyed at once. The advanced cooperative discussed several times: "Repair, or not to repair?" It would cost thousands of yuan to repair, and more than 10,000 workdays. After calculating for a long time, because there was no such strength, they had to not repair it. Once the commune was established, the funds were uniformly resolved by the commune, and the labor force was uniformly mobilized by the commune. The salt fields destroyed by artillery fire were repaired within a few days. At the same time, the commune also allocated funds to add wind-powered waterwheels and handcarts. 60% of the salt fields implemented water lifting and wind power, and the salt transportation was motorized, which can save more than 20,000 labor days a year.

	As soon as the commune was established, it took out 50,000 yuan for the shipping brigade to repair and build ships. The shipworkers had the commune as their backing, and they were no longer afraid of big winds and waves breaking their ships, and their interest in improving technology also became stronger. In the past, from Xiamen to Nan'an Shuitou, they did not dare to sail at night; now, they sail day and night, and the number of voyages per month has increased from seven to twelve. Previously, only two old sailors could take the route to Shantou, Guangdong, and the farthest north was to Fuzhou; now, they learn from each other's technology and exchange experience. Eighty-seven old sailors can take the route to Shantou, and the northern route has also extended to Shanghai.

Overcoming Rare Typhoon Attacks

	This year, the Three Islands Frontline People's Commune also overcame a rare major wind disaster.

	At 2:00 a.m. on August 23, 1959, a typhoon, along with a high tide, struck the three islands. The tide set off waves several feet high. In just over an hour, 51 of the 95 ships of the shipping brigade were broken; more than 3,900 meters of seawall were washed away, and seawater flooded into the embankment; 6,144 mu of salt fields were damaged, accounting for 56% of the total area; 1.1 million of the 1.2 million oyster stones were blown down; and 330 mu of crops were also damaged. In addition to the loss of small boats, farm implements, and salt tools, the total value reached 410,000 yuan.

	This was a major wind disaster that had not occurred in 43 years. But the people's commune withstood it and overcame it.

	After the typhoon, the commune party committee immediately led the masses to produce and rescue the disaster. After more than 1,100 meters of the Nandawai embankment, which protected the banks of the Qizaki Village of the Salt Brigade, was swept away by the tide, the commune transferred more than 800 strong laborers from the agricultural brigade, and the troops also transferred more than 200 people to support them. Together with the laborers of the salt brigade, a total of more than 1,200 people braved the wind and rain, starting early and returning late, and rushed to repair it. As the tide rose by one chi, the embankment was two chi higher. In seven days, they made more than 13,000 cubic meters of earthwork and more than 2,500 cubic meters of stone work, and built a new Nandawai. Old commune member Zheng Chunlian said: "I am convinced. When I joined the commune, I thought that having food and clothing was the superiority of the commune. I never expected that the commune would have such great abilities. It is true that a long journey reveals the strength of a horse." The 1.1 million oyster seedlings that were blown down were also uniformly transferred by the commune to more than 1,000 laborers to work hard in the sea for seven days, digging out oyster stones from the sand and setting them all up. The labor force of the agricultural brigade, on the one hand, stepped up processing and topdressing in the third-class seedlings to compensate for the losses caused by the disaster; on the other hand, discharged the saltwater from the submerged land, carried out plowing and flushing, and strived to plant a season of wheat in winter. The disaster was stopped. In less than a month, various productions showed a vibrant scene again. The salt industry and wooden boat transportation industry, which were the most seriously affected, fully resumed production by the end of October. This is truly the power of the people's commune to turn the tide!

Living Ascends in the Flames of War

	Artillery fire and typhoons cannot stop the Three Islands Frontline People's Commune from leaping forward in production, nor can they destroy the new life that the people's commune has brought to the masses.

	In the first half of 1959, the part of the total income of the whole commune distributed to the commune members was 470,000 yuan, an increase of about 50% compared with the period of the advanced cooperative. The proportion of production growth is very large, and the commune can implement a distribution system that combines wages and supply. Among the 1,626 households in the entire commune, 1,464 households had increased income compared with last year, accounting for 90% of the total number of households. Before transferring to the commune, there were 485 households in the advanced cooperative. Because of the large population and few labor forces, it was difficult to maintain the income of life, and it was necessary to overspend a part of grain and cash to the agricultural cooperative; after the establishment of the commune, there was no such household. Now there are 1,306 households in the entire commune with savings in the credit cooperative, accounting for 80% of the total number of households. With the increase of income, many people wear woolen sweaters, silk clothes, etc. For thousands of years, countless people have worried about the problem of eating. The people's commune has solved it, and the broad masses have obtained the most reliable social insurance. Li Jin's old woman from Haiyan Brigade said: "In the past, I worried about three meals a day. Now I think about production all day long." This sentence vividly reflects the happy mood of the masses.

    大炮打不垮　台风吹不散
    ——福建前线三岛战地人民公社调查
    在福建省最前线，波涛汹涌的台湾海峡中，有一个距离蒋匪军盘踞的大金门岛只有二千五百米的人民公社——金门县的大嶝、小嶝、角屿三岛组成的战地人民公社。
    这三个矗立海中、地势低平的弹丸小岛，总面积仅有六平方公里。全国解放以来，盘踞在大金门的匪军，利用居高临下的地形，经常不断地炮击三岛。但是，饱经炮火洗礼的三岛英雄人民，一面和驻军并肩保卫着祖国海防，把三岛变成了三把插入金门心脏的尖刀，不断用猛烈炮火，给予蒋匪军以沉重的打击；一面在弹雨硝烟中坚持生产，沸腾地建设着社会主义。
    这个公社在将近一年的时间内，先后遭到匪军六万多发炮弹的射击，又经历了一次极为严重的风灾袭击，生产上的困难，是人们难以想像到的。可是目前岛上的一切景象，实在令人欢欣：刚收获了丰硕的大豆、花生、早稻、高粱的田野，又被叶肥蔓长的番薯、枝秆和茁壮的晚稻盖满了；被炮弹打毁的盐坎，重新闪烁着晶亮的盐花；在炮火圈内的海峡中，船只乘风破浪穿梭来往；造船厂通宵抢修被炮火和台风摧毁的船只。这一切，很难使人相信这是前线上的海岛。公社党委书记告诉我们：“在十年对敌斗争中，要算去年‘八·二三’的炮战最猛烈，可是，我们的生产、支前和人民武装，也从来没有像公社化以后发展得这样迅速，这么强大！”敌人的大炮打不垮人民公社，台风也吹不散人民公社，人们用战斗保卫生产，用生产支援战斗，这里是铜墙铁壁的三岛。
    大炮声中大跃进
    在公社党委会，我们看到了令人兴奋的数字：今年上半年公社总收入八十三万多元，比去年同期增加了35％。
    三岛战地人民公社共有八个生产大队（六个农业大队，一个船业运输大队，一个盐业大队），五千七百多亩耕地，其中有三千七百多亩中炮弹三万多发；今年又碰上了极为不利的天气（降雨量过多），然而，三岛战地人民公社1959年上半年生产仍然取得了惊人的成就。海蛎子是三岛上一项重要生产，今年得到了特大丰收，蛎肉产量达到一百一十二万斤，比1958年增产56％；木帆船运输总收入是三十一万多元，比1958年增长34％；副业收入五万九千多元，比1958年同期翻了一番。
    春天，这是收获海蛎子的季节。而海蛎子大部分种在靠近金门的海峡里。抢收开始，步兵和民兵在前沿组织武装保卫，炮兵负责监视敌人，保卫生产。春雨连绵，波涛汹涌，社员们冒着风雨和骇浪搏斗，白天分散下海抢收，晚上集中下海抢收。在这场战斗里，公社统一调动劳动力和工具，使生产进行得又快又好。南星大队凭自己的劳动力收不完三十三万五千株海蛎子，便划出四万五千株给海鹰大队；船业队和渔民也抽出了二十多条小船支援收海蛎子，代替了往年用人力一担一担地从海里往岸上挑的笨重劳动。今年每个人的收获量从过去一潮水收一百二十斤增加到五百斤。人们说：“这是人民公社的力量。”
    春耕大忙开始了，土地被炮弹打翻了。群众嘲笑说：“蒋介石也响应深翻土的号召”。按照我军对金门蒋贼军单日打炮、双日不打的规定，因此最前沿的生产队，过去只能在双日劳动。办起公社后，他们单日便转移到地形比较隐蔽的生产队劳动，晚上集中几个队的劳力到前沿突击。同时，普遍利用田边挖的防炮洞和单人掩体，和敌人炮火周旋；白天抢犁田，抢播种，敌人一打炮，就连人带牛钻到洞里；炮声一停，人们马上又从洞里安然地跳出来，继续春耕。公社就这样组织了各个大队的力量，有计划地在炮火中进行生产，陆续把二千六百多亩耕地上的二万二千多个弹坑填平了，可以耕种的四千五百多亩土地全部种上了庄稼。
    盐业生产方面，人民公社和高级社时期比较，首先是抗击灾害的能力大大加强了。1958年9月3日的一场炮战，盐坎一下被打坏七百多亩，高级社时讨论了好几次：“修，还是不修？”修起来要几千元钱，一万多个工，计算了半天，因为没有这么大的力量，只好不修了。一办公社，资金由公社统一解决，劳动力由公社统一调动，在几天内就修复了这处被炮火打毁了的盐坎。同时，公社还调拨资金添置了风力水车和手推车，60％的盐坎实行了车水风力化，运盐车子化，一年能够节约两万多个劳动日。
    公社一办起来，就拿出了五万元给船业大队修造船只。船业大队成立了自己的造船厂，船工们有了公社这个靠山，再也不怕大风大浪打破船只，改进技术的兴趣也浓厚起来。过去，由厦门到南安水头，晚上不敢航行；现在，昼夜通航，一个月由七个航次增加到十二个航次。以前只有两个老?能走广东汕头的航线，北面最远是跑到福州；现在，互相学习技术，交流经验，有八十七个老?能走汕头，北面的航线，还延伸到上海。
    战胜少有的台风袭击
    三岛战地人民公社今年还战胜了少有的大风灾。
    1959年8月23日早晨两点钟，台风挟着大潮袭击了三岛，潮水掀起了几丈高的巨浪，仅仅一个多小时，船业大队的九十五条船被打破了五十一条；海堤被冲垮了三千九百多米，海水浸入堤内；盐坎被冲坏了六千一百四十四亩，占总面积56％；一百二十万株蛎石，被刮倒了一百一十万株；农作物也有三百三十亩受到损害；加上小船、农具、盐具的损失，总价值达四十一万元。
    这是四十三年来没有过的一次大风灾。可是人民公社顶住了它，战胜了它。
    台风过后，公社党委马上领导群众生产救灾。盐业大队?崎村护坎的一千一百多米南大围被海潮扫平之后，公社从农业大队抽调了八百多个壮劳力，部队也抽调二百多人来支援，加上盐业大队的劳力，一共一千二百多人冒着狂风暴雨，起早带晚，突击抢修。潮水涨一尺，堤岸高两尺，七天工夫做了一万三千多土方，二千五百多石方，修起了一条新的南大围。老社员郑春练说：“我算信服了，入了公社我想有吃有穿就是公社的优越性，料想不到公社有这样大的本事，真是路遥知马力。”被风刮倒的一百一十万株蛎苗，也由公社统一抽调一千多个劳力下海苦干七天，从沙里刨出蛎石，全部扶了起来。农业大队的劳动力，一方面加紧在三类苗中加工补肥，弥补受灾损失；一方面排出受淹土地的咸水，进行翻犁冲洗，争取冬季种上一季麦子。灾情被制止了，不到一个月，各项生产又呈现了生气勃勃的景象，受灾最严重的盐业、木船运输业，到10月底便全部恢复生产。这真是人民公社回天之力！
    生活在战火中上升
    战火、台风不能阻挡三岛战地人民公社生产向前飞跃，也摧毁不了人民公社给群众带来的新生活。
    1959年上半年，全公社总收入中分配给社员的部分是四十七万元，比高级社时期增加了约50％。生产增长比例很大，公社就有可能实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度。全公社一千六百二十六户中，有一千四百六十四户收入比去年增加了，占总户数90％。转入公社之前，高级社里有四百八十五户，因为人口多劳动力少，收入难以维持生活，需要向农业社超支一部分粮食和现金；办公社以后，这样的户一户也没有了。现在全公社有一千三百零六户在信用部里有存款，占总户数80％。随着收入的增加，许多人穿上了毛线衣、绸衣等。千百年来，无数群众为吃饭问题发愁担心，人民公社给解决了，广大群众得到了最可靠的社会保险。海燕大队李锦老婆婆说：“过去一日愁三餐，现在整天想生产。”这句话生动地反映了群众的愉快心情。
