Red flags flutter in the wind,
In Yun County is Gao Huatang,
Governing water, soil, and mountains,
Surpassing the legendary Yu the Great of old.

(Spoken) Everyone: If you want to know how Gao Huatang led the masses to transform a poor and desolate mountain into a land of fish and rice, and barren hills into a paradise of fruits and flowers, then listen to me tell the story slowly:

(Singing)
Looking north from the west gate of Yun County,
There’s the Jiuligang in Danian,
The mountains are full of barren rocks,
Even cowherds won’t go up there.

There are some scattered steep slopes,
A hoe strikes the ground with a clang,
If you don't stand firm,
You'll flip head over heels.

There are some fields along the gullies,
Either cold sand or flowing slurry.
Wheat grows like a bald man's hair,
The ears are not even half an inch long.

Eight ridges and ten gullies,
A few dilapidated ponds,
Some use water, but no one manages it,
Mud silts up to the edges of the ponds.

If water and soil in the mountains aren't managed well,
Reclaiming wasteland only leads to disaster.

Branch Secretary Gao Huatang,
Thinks day and night about transforming the fields,
One day, standing on the mountain top,
He gazed at the mountain slopes, pondering:

When will the river water climb the mountains?
When will clear channels spread across the ridges?
When will terraced fields be built to the summit?
When will every gully have a pond?

As long as every household can eat white rice regularly,
I'll happily run around, endure hardship, and be content!

The brilliance of the General Line shines infinitely,
The People's Commune is like the sun.
With many people in the commune, strength is great,
Obstacles to progress are swept away.

The Party Committee makes unified plans,
Calling for the construction of Jiuligang,
Secretary Gao took the lead, boldly taking command,
All commune members bravely followed.

Setting up a large camp on the high mountain,
Drums and gongs resound everywhere.
They bisected the cliffs of Panjia Rock,
Liberated the bald Sanligang,
Transformed the cold sandy Gongjia Gully,
The Chuanshan Cave at Mao Cao Ya is thirty-six zhang long!

Without hiring a single technician,
The masses are better than Zhuge Liang.
Commune members burn lime themselves,
Hunters prepare the gunpowder,
The method of digging high and filling low is good,
Hazel sticks are used as crowbars.
The carpenter's square is used as a level, (Spoken) A little higher, a little to the left,
Draw the line on that collapse! (Singing) Guess who the surveyor is?
It's Secretary Gao Huatang!

They built one hundred and ten winding mountain channels,
Totaling more than five hundred li in length.
There are three large and small reservoirs,
And one hundred and forty-two ponds were dug.

Seedlings connected to melons, melons connected to seedlings,
Dams connected to channels, channels connected to ponds,
The whole mountain is like a pumpkin trellis,
The water from the ridge channels flows into the ponds.

Terraced fields climb the mountains like fish scales,
Like layers of tall buildings.
Fish in the ponds churn white waves,
Every one is a foot long.

Old man Wu Baokun walks by the pond,
Looking at the pond water, he is overjoyed:
He says that in the past, water was measured with a ladle,
Now the pond gate makes a rushing sound with a shake.
I, this old man, have lived seventy-three years,
I've never seen crops arranged like this!

People are refreshed by happy events,
Men and women, old and young, are extraordinarily busy.
A big road is built in three days,
Cars run with a "dudu" sound.

Loaded with many fruit trees,
Planted all over Jiuligang;
Apples and sugar pears are loved by everyone,
Peaches and tangerines are lined up in rows.

The field ridges are covered with beard grass,
Each clump is five feet long,
Protecting the fields and making paper,
Producing a large amount every year.

Water pushes the millstone, water turns the grinder,
Oil presses, paper mills, processing plants,
Are all water-powered and automated,
Irrigation is not affected,
A hydroelectric power station is built on the mountain,
The machine turns with a "whoosh" sound,
Before the sun sets in the west,
Every household is brightly lit.

High mountains and flowing water are at our command,
Poor and remote areas become paradise.
This year, despite a three-month drought,
We still achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest of grain!

Big rivers let small rivers flow,
Life is rising day by day:
Fresh fish, chicken, and duck are all available,
White rice and fine flour are common meals.

Brother representatives came to visit,
Everyone praised Gao Huatang:
The red flag flutters in the spring breeze,
A good example of governing water and mountains.
Great achievements in two years of hard work,
A good direction for mountain area construction!

专栏：

    山乡红旗（坠子书）	湖北郧县农民　郭贵恩（唱）红旗招展迎风扬，
    郧县有个高华堂，
    治水治土又治山，
    赛过昔日夏禹王。（白）各位：要知道高华堂怎样带领
    群众叫穷山恶水变成鱼米之
    乡，叫荒山秃岭变成花果乐园，
    且听我慢慢道来：（唱）出了郧县西门往北望，
    大埝有条九里岗，
    满山尽是麻果石，
    放牛娃都不到那山上。
    有点把零星陡坡地，
    一锄头挖去响??，
    要是你脚步没站稳，
    一仰脸就翻了个脚朝上。
    冲里有些沿沟地
    不是寒沙就流浆。
    麦子长的像秃子毛，
    麦穗子还没得半寸长。
    八道梁子十道沟，
    破破烂烂几口塘，
    有人用水无人管，
    泥巴淤到塘沿上。
    山区水土搞不好，
    开了荒来又遭殃。
    支部书记高华堂，
    日夜都把改田想，
    有一天站在山头上，
    眼望山坡自思量：
    哪天河水翻上山？
    哪天清渠遍岗梁？
    哪天梯田改上顶？
    哪天条条冲里都有塘？
    只要是家家户户白米变成家常饭，
    我就是东奔西跑，吃苦受累，也舒畅！
    总路线光芒高万丈，
    人民公社像太阳。
    公社人多力量大，
    前进的障碍一扫光。
    党委统一作规划，
    号召建设九里岗，
    高书记一马当先挂帅印，
    众社员个个奋勇齐赶上。
    高山之上扎大营，
    遍地锣鼓咚咚响。
    腰斩了悬壁潘家岩，
    解放了秃岭三里岗，
    改造了寒沙龚家沟，
    茅草垭的穿山洞有三十六丈长！
    技术员没请一个，
    群众赛过诸葛亮。
    石灰社员自己烧，
    火药是猎手配停当，
    高挖低垫法子好，
    桦栗棒子当撬扛。
    木匠尺当作水平仪，（白）高一点，再往左一点，
    就在那塌线画上！（唱）你猜测量员是哪一个？
    还是书记——高华堂！
    修了一百一十条盘山渠，
    共有五百多里长。
    大小水库有三个，
    还挖了一百四十二口塘。
    秧连瓜来瓜连秧，
    堰连渠来渠连塘，
    满山好像南瓜架
    梁上的渠水流进塘。
    梯田上山好似鱼鳞甲，
    又像层层高楼房。
    塘中鱼儿翻白浪，
    条条都有尺把长。
    武宝坤老汉打从塘边过，
    眼观塘水喜洋洋：
    他说是从前放水用瓢量
    如今塘桩一摇哗哗响。
    我老汉活了七十三，
    没见过庄稼这排场！
    人逢喜事精神爽，
    男女老少分外忙。
    三天修条大公路，
    汽车跑的嘟嘟响。
    装来许多果木树，
    栽遍整个九里岗；
    苹果糖梨人人爱，
    桃子橘柑排成行。
    田埂披满龙须草，
    每兜都有五尺长，
    又护田来又造纸，
    每年出产一大桩。
    水推碾子，水打磨，
    油坊、纸厂、加工厂，
    全是水力自动化，
    灌溉还不受影响，
    水力电厂山上安，
    机器转的呼呼响，
    不等西山太阳落，
    家家户户亮堂堂。
    高山流水听使唤，
    穷乡僻壤成天堂。
    今年大旱三个月，
    还全面打下丰收粮！
    大河涨水小河让，
    生活天天往上涨：
    鲜鱼鸡鸭样样有，
    白米细面成家常。
    兄弟代表来参观，
    个个夸奖高华堂：
    红旗飘飘东风里，
    治水治山好榜样。
    两年苦战成绩大，
    山区建设好方向！
