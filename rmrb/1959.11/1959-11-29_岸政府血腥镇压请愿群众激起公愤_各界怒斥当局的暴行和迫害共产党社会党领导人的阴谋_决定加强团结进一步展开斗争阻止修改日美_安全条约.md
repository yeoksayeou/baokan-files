Xinhua News Agency, 28th Dispatch from Tokyo: The Kishida Nobusuke government's bloody suppression of the people petitioning the Diet on the 27th has been met with angry condemnation from Japanese progressive parties and organizations.

This atrocity was premeditated by the Kishida Nobusuke government. According to a report by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation on the 25th, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department had already made preparations at that time, deciding to deploy 5,000 police officers around the Diet to prevent the demonstration on the 27th from conducting a collective petition to the Diet. On the 27th, the Metropolitan Police Department dispatched 5,500 police officers and six armored vehicles for "guarding." According to the Japan Broadcasting Corporation, this was the largest deployment of police officers since the war. When the marchers opposing the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and protesting the Liberal Democratic Party's forceful passage of the war reparations agreement with South Vietnam through the House of Representatives on the 26th approached the Diet to petition, the police officers openly attacked the petitioning marchers, provoking conflict and causing a bloody tragedy. According to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), more than a dozen workers and students were seriously injured by police beatings, and about 200 were slightly injured.

It is reported that the Kishida Nobusuke government also hired a group of thugs from extreme nationalist groups to cooperate with the police in attacking the petitioning masses. At the same time, under the instigation of the Kishida Nobusuke government, right-wing groups such as the "Greater Japan Patriotic Party" also held a rally in front of Shinbashi Station to "promote the revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," plotting to undermine the united action of the Japanese people against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

After committing this atrocity, the Kishida Nobusuke government even attempted to shift the blame and persecute the leaders of the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party. The Liberal Democratic Party decided at a summit meeting this morning to ask the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Kajo Ryogoro (a member of the Liberal Democratic Party), to "severely punish" House of Representatives member and Japanese Communist Party leader Shiga Yoshio and Socialist Party Secretary-General Asanuma Inejirō. The ruling party insisted that the two of them led the masses to enter the Diet to petition. At the same time, the Kishida Nobusuke group also attempted to take the opportunity to deprive the Japanese people of their right to petition the Diet as stipulated by the Constitution. The Liberal Democratic Party summit meeting decided today to formulate a fascist law to prohibit the Japanese people from holding demonstrations around the Diet and the Supreme Court.

Kishida Nobusuke also stated in a speech in Yamaguchi Prefecture today that he would study the issue of prohibiting demonstrations outside the Diet through the Diet Steering Committee.

The Kishida Nobusuke government's atrocities and slanderous tricks have aroused the anger of the Japanese people. The organizers of the petition on the 27th, the National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," issued a declaration that evening, saying: "Petitioning the Diet is an act of exercising our legitimate rights. The government has mobilized police forces to suppress it, causing many injuries. We are very angry with the government and the Liberal Democratic Party that suppressed our struggle, and we will further develop the struggle."

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) issued a statement on the 28th, pointing out that the responsibility for the chaos that occurred within the Diet lies with the government and the Liberal Democratic Party, because the government and the Liberal Democratic Party mobilized police forces to provoke the people who were petitioning based on their rights. The statement also said, "If the government and the Liberal Democratic Party unilaterally impose the responsibility for causing chaos on the demonstration marchers and strengthen suppression in the future, then we will strengthen unity and take all mass actions to carry out united action in order to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty."

The Japanese Communist Party's Diet members group, headed by Shiga Yoshio, lodged a protest today with Liberal Democratic Party Vice President Ohno Banboku and Secretary-General Kawashima Shojiro, exposing that the Liberal Democratic Party's statement on the 26th that Asanuma Inejirō and Shiga Yoshio led tens of thousands of demonstrators to "break into" the Diet was not in accordance with the facts.

The Central Executive Committee of the Japan Socialist Party held an emergency meeting today. The meeting decided that if the Liberal Democratic Party insisted on "punishing" Asanuma Inejirō, the Socialist Party would fully oppose it. The meeting approved the report of Akamatsu Yu, Chairman of the National Movement Committee of the Socialist Party, which pointed out that the mass petition on the 27th was held responsibly and was an act of exercising the right to petition that every citizen is allowed under the Constitution.

The meeting also decided that the Socialist Party will actively engage in struggles during the ninth and tenth unified actions to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" and the movement against Kishida Nobusuke going to the United States to sign a new "Security Treaty."

On the 27th, the Socialist Party issued a statement pointing out that the Japanese people's petition to the Diet during the eighth unified action was carried out according to the legitimate right to petition and was a manifestation of the masses' anger against paying war reparations to South Vietnam and revising the "Security Treaty." The statement also condemned the police for "consciously provoking" the petitioning masses.

Asanuma Inejirō and Akamatsu Yu stated in a speech on the 27th that there had been previous instances of the masses entering the Diet. In that instance and this time, the Diet did not suffer any particular damage, so it cannot be considered that the situation on the 27th was serious. They also pointed out that the Speaker of the Diet did not take sufficient measures for this mass petition, therefore, the internal responsibility of the Diet lies with the Speaker.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th Dispatch from Tokyo: The Kishida Nobusuke government began arresting the organizations and their leaders who participated in the large-scale petition against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" yesterday.

The Kishida Nobusuke government's Metropolitan Police Department arrested three leading cadres of the All-Japan Student Self-Government Association Federation and the Tokyo Metropolitan Student Self-Government Association Federation this morning on suspicion of "violating the Public Safety Ordinance." It is reported that this police agency will also summon Socialist Party Secretary-General Asanuma Inejirō today or tomorrow, and will also summon leading cadres of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the Tokyo Local Council, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Teachers' Union.

Tonight, the Metropolitan Police Department searched the offices of Sohyo, the Tokyo Local Council, the National Metal Workers' Union, and its Tokyo branch.

    岸政府血腥镇压请愿群众激起公愤
    各界怒斥当局的暴行和迫害共产党社会党领导人的阴谋  决定加强团结进一步展开斗争阻止修改日美“安全条约”
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府27日出动大批警察血腥镇压向国会请愿的人民的暴行，遭到日本进步党派和团体的愤怒谴责。
    这次暴行是岸信介政府蓄谋制造的。据日本广播协会电台25日报道，东京警视厅在当时就已作好准备，决定在国会周围部署五千名警察，不让27日的示威队伍向国会进行集体请愿。27日当天，警视厅出动了五千五百名警察和六辆装甲车进行“戒备”。据日本广播协会电台说，这是战后出动警察人数最多的一次。当反对修改日美“安全条约”、抗议自由民主党26日强使众议院通过对南越的战争赔偿协定的游行队伍，走近国会进行请愿时，在当地待机出动的警察公然攻击请愿队伍，挑起冲突，造成流血惨案。据日本工会总评议会宣布，有十几名工人和学生被警察凶殴受重伤，约有两百人受轻伤。
    据报道，岸信介政府还雇用了一批极端国家主义团体的打手协同警察攻击请愿群众。同时，在岸信介政府的唆使下，“大日本爱国党”等右翼团体还在新桥车站前面举行了“推进修改日美安全条约”的集会，阴谋破坏日本人民反对修改“安全条约”的统一行动。
    岸信介政府在制造这次暴行之后，居然企图转嫁责任，迫害日本共产党和社会党的领导人。自由民主党今天早晨在首脑会议上决定要求众议院议长加藤镣五郎（自由民主党人），“严厉惩处”众议院议员、日本共产党领导人志贺义雄和社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎。执政党硬说是他们两人领导群众进入国会请愿。同时，岸信介集团还企图乘机剥夺日本人民为宪法所规定的向国会请愿的权利。自由民主党首脑会议今天决定要制定一项法西斯法律，禁止日本人民在国会和最高裁判所周围举行示威。
    岸信介今天在山口县发表谈话时也表示，要通过议员运营委员会来研究禁止在国会外面举行示威游行的问题。
    岸信介政府的暴行和反诬的伎俩激起了日本人民的愤怒。27日的请愿的组织者——阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议在当天晚上发表宣言说：“向国会请愿是我们行使正当权利的行为。对此，政府总动员警察的力量加以镇压，使很多人受伤。我们对镇压我们的斗争的政府和自由民主党感到非常愤怒，要更进一步展开斗争。”
    日本工会总评议会28日发表声明指出，请愿队伍在国会内发生混乱的责任在于政府和自由民主党，因为政府和自由民主党对人民根据他们的权利而进行的请愿动员警察力量进行挑衅。声明又说，“如果今后政府和自由民主党把造成混乱的责任片面地强加在示威游行队伍的头上并加强镇压，那么我们就要加强团结，采取一切群众行动来展开统一行动，以便阻止修改日美安全条约”。
    以志贺义雄为首的日本共产党国会议员团今天向自由民主党副总裁大野伴睦和干事长川岛正次郎提出抗议，揭露自由民主党26日发表声明说浅沼稻次郎和志贺义雄带领好几万示威游行队伍“闯进”国会，这是不符合事实的。
    日本社会党中央执行委员会今天举行了紧急会议，会议决定，如果自由民主党一意孤行，硬要“惩处”浅沼稻次郎，社会党将全力加以反对。会议批准了社会党国民运动委员会委员长赤松勇的报告，这个报告指出，27日的群众请愿是在负责的情况下举行的，并且是行使宪法所允许的每一个国民都享有的请愿权的行动。
    会议还决定，社会党将在第九、第十次阻止修改“安全条约”统一行动和反对岸信介到美国去签订新的“安全条约”的运动中，积极地进行斗争。
    在27日当天，社会党曾经发表声明指出，日本人民在第八次统一行动中向国会请愿是根据正当的请愿权进行的，是群众反对向南越支付战争赔偿和修改“安全条约”的愤怒的表现，声明并且谴责警察对请愿群众“有意识地进行挑拨”。
    浅沼稻次郎和赤松勇在27日发表谈话指出，曾经有过群众进入国会的前例。在那一次和这一次群众进入国会的事情中，国会都没有特别遭到损害，因此，不能认为27日的事态是严重的。他们并且指出，国会议长对这次群众请愿的事情没有采取充分的对策，因此，国会内部的责任在于议长。
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府今天开始搜捕昨天参加反对日美“安全条约”大请愿的组织和他们的领导人。
    岸信介政府的警视厅今天早晨借口“违反公安条例”的嫌疑，逮捕了全日本学生自治会总联合会、东京都学生自治会联合会的三个领导干部。据报道，这个警察机关还要在今天或明天传讯社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎，并且要传讯日本工会总评议会、东京地方评议会、东京都教职员工会的领导干部。
    今天晚上，警视厅搜查了总评议会、东京地方评议会、全国金属工会和它的东京地方分会的办事处。
