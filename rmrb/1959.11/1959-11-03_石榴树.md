    Pomegranate Tree
    [Visiting the Jing’an Home for the Elderly in Yamenkou, Shijingshan Commune] In the courtyard, there are rows of green trees, with red pomegranates hanging on the branches; the old people come out to greet the guests, a gust of breeze stirs the treetops.
    Ripe pomegranates are not as red as the "glow of old age," their foreheads are all rosy and smooth; happy smiles flow along the corners of their mouths, and the spring water rushes in the hearts of the old people.
    The old society bent blind Grandma's back, you cried to heaven and earth and cried your eyes blind; pushing the millstone from childhood until your hair turned white, the landlord kicked you out the door!
    No sons, no daughters, no food, old and lonely, who can't be moved by your plight: "If the Communist Party had come one step later, the crows would have eaten my old and lonely body..."
    "Poor my old partner froze to death, at that time this place was not yet liberated;..." Rubbing your blind, tearful eyes, you smile: "It's an old ailment, it flares up as soon as I mention it."
    You touch the clean white sheets, point to this bright and clean tiled house, old Mama, you laugh loudly, your face radiating a red glow.
    Old Mama is already eighty years old this year, unable to stay idle, you keep twirling cotton thread, twirling and twirling, you say happily: "Even a blind person like me wants to live another twenty years!"
    In the courtyard, there are rows of green trees, and the pomegranates on the trees are sweeter than the last; the old people walk to the door to see the guests off, and the laughter flies very, very far...

    石榴树
    〔访问石景山公社衙门口敬老院〕庭院里有一排排绿叶树，枝上挂着一个个红石榴；老人们走出来迎接客人，一阵清风吹动着树枝头。熟石榴也红不过“老来红”，他们个个额上红光溜溜；幸福的笑沿着嘴角流淌，春水在老人们心里奔流。旧社会压弯瞎大娘的腰，你喊天喊地哭瞎了眼睛；从小推磨推到了头发白，地主就把你扫地推出门！没儿没女没吃的老孤寡，谁从你身上不感到激动：“要是共产党晚来了一步，乌鸦早吃掉我这孤老身……”
  “可怜我老伴活活冻死了，那时候这里还没有解放；……”揉一揉瞎的泪眼你笑笑：“老毛病一说它就又犯上。”你摸摸干净的白色床单，指指这窗明几净的瓦房，老妈妈你高声笑了起来，满面发出来红色的光芒。老妈妈今年已经八十整，闲不住你不停地捻棉线，捻着捻着你乐呵呵地说：“瞎子我也要再活二十年！”庭院里有一排排绿叶树，满树石榴一个比一个甜；老人们走到门口送客人，欢笑声飞扬了很远很远……
