Organize a Short-Distance Transportation Network
Wang Huofu, Secretary of the CPC黎城 County Committee, Shanxi Province

黎城 County, Shanxi Province, is located in the eastern part of the Taihang Mountains. 90% of the area is hilly and mountainous, with abundant reserves of mountain products, local specialties, and minerals. In 1959, the total transportation volume exceeded 120,000 tons, which is four times the cargo volume of 1958. However, the county's original transportation capacity was twenty times less than the transportation demand. How to complete such a large transportation task? At that time, some people advocated "asking the Special Zone Transportation Bureau to allocate more cars" and "requesting the higher authorities to increase transportation tools." The 黎城 County Party Committee held a special meeting to study transportation work. Through debate, it was unanimously agreed that the policy of mass participation in transportation should be resolutely implemented. The meeting determined that communes should engage in transportation, districts should engage in transportation, and all kinds of rural transportation tools should be fully utilized to complete transportation tasks through self-reliance. According to the instructions of the County Party Committee, combined with agricultural production, "small-scale transportation during busy farming seasons, large-scale transportation during slack seasons" the people's communes and management districts made unified arrangements for short-distance transportation while arranging industrial and agricultural production. Based on different conditions, the labor and animal power for short-distance transportation were planned. A total of 200 professional short-distance transportation teams of rubber-tired horse carts, 26 rubber-tired horse carts, 210 small flatbed carts, and 554 iron-wheeled carts were organized for temporary transportation throughout the county. In addition, a reserve transportation team was also organized.

After the transportation forces were organized, we focused on organizing the short-distance transportation network. In the past, due to the lack of unified leadership and arrangements, the short-distance transportation in 黎城 County was in a state of scattered self-flow. Industrial, commercial, and grain departments arranged their own transportation separately, often allocating empty vehicles to go into the mountains to pick up goods; while people's communes and management districts had to specially send vehicles to the 长治 area to transport coal. Cars entering the mountains were blocked by the mountains as soon as they left the city, carrying little, running slowly, and often experiencing "breakdown" accidents. Iron-wheeled vehicles from the mountains were restricted by road regulations as soon as they left the mountains and were not allowed to drive on highways. Many transportation tools could not play their role, and the counter-current of empty vehicles caused a great waste of transportation capacity.

In response to this situation, the County Party Committee decided to uniformly arrange the county's short-distance transportation and organize a short-distance transportation network. We set up four transfer stations along the highway and established transportation points in nine central areas. Around the nine transportation points, more than 200 transportation areas were divided. Iron-wheeled and wooden-wheeled vehicles ran exclusively on short mountain roads, responsible for transportation between transportation points and transfer stations; cars ran exclusively on long-distance highways, responsible for transporting the county's materials out of the transfer stations and transporting the county's needed materials from other places to the transfer stations. The county's transportation tasks were uniformly controlled by the County Transportation Company, which arranged them according to priorities. The County Transportation Company also consulted with the professional transportation command, stipulating that all cars transporting goods to 黎城 must bring back coal and daily necessities, and all vehicles going to transfer stations and transportation points to pick up coal must bring mountain products and minerals. In this way, cars did not enter the mountains, iron-wheeled vehicles did not go down the plains, and there were no empty vehicles coming and going; through various transfer stations and transportation points, various transportation tools were connected, one section after another, transporting rural mountain products and local specialties and industrial raw materials to cities, and transporting coal and industrial products from cities to rural areas.

Due to the vigorous mass movement for short-distance transportation and the formation of a short-distance transportation network, 黎城 has achieved "no stagnation of commercial materials and no backlog of industrial raw materials." From January to September this year, the county completed a total cargo volume of 69,324 tons, more than three times the same period in 1958, which not only completed the state's transfer tasks, but also directly stimulated the production of local specialties. Since the transportation problem was solved, diversified economy has been greatly developed. The masses reflected that "short-distance transportation plays a great role, benefiting the country and the family, local specialties are all sold, and the income of the masses is greatly increased."

    组织短途运输网
    中共山西省黎城县县委书记　王火福
    山西黎城县在太行山东部，90％的地区是丘陵沟壑地带和高山峻岭，山货土产和矿石的蕴藏量很丰富。1959年全年运输量在十二万吨以上，等于1958年货运量的四倍。可是全县原有运力和运量相差二十倍之多。如何完成这样大的运输任务呢？当时曾有些人主张“让专区交通局多调拨一些汽车来”，“请上级给增加运输工具”。黎城县委专门召开会议研究了交通运输工作，通过辩论一致认为，应该坚决贯彻全民办运输的方针。会上确定：社社办运输，区区办运输，充分运用农村的各种运输工具，自力更生完成运输任务。根据县委的指示，结合农业生产，“农忙时小搞，农闲时大搞”，各个人民公社和管理区在安排工农业生产的同时，对短途运输作了统一安排，根据不同条件，规划出短途运输的劳力和畜力。全县共组织起二百辆胶轮马车的专业短途运输队伍，二十六辆胶轮马车，二百一十辆小平车和五百五十四辆铁轮车的临时运输队伍。另外还组织了后备运输队。
    运输力量组织起来以后，我们着重抓了短途运输网的组织工作。过去由于没有统一的领导和安排，黎城县的短途运输处于分散自流状态。工业、商业和粮食部门，各自安排自己的运输，常常调拨空车进山区拉货；而人民公社和管理区不得不专门派车到长治一带运煤。进山的汽车一出城就被大山挡住，载的少，跑的慢，并且经常发生“抛锚”事故。山里的铁轮车一出山就被公路规章制度限制，不许行驶公路。许多运输工具不能发挥作用，而空车对流又造成了运输力的很大浪费。
    县委针对这一情况，决定把全县的短途运输统一加以安排，组织短途运输网。我们在公路沿线设立了四个中转站，在九个中心区建立了运输点，围绕九个运输点又划分了二百多个运输片。铁轮车、木轮车专跑短途山路，负责运输点和中转站之间的运输；汽车专跑长途公路，负责把本县的物资从中转站运出去，把本县需要的物资从外地运到中转站。全县的运输任务由县运输公司统一掌握，根据轻重缓急加以安排。县运输公司又和专业运输指挥部商定，凡运货到黎城的汽车，必须捎回煤炭和日用品，凡到中转站和运输点拉煤的车辆必须捎去山货和矿石。这样就做到了汽车不进山，铁轮车不下川，来往没空车；通过各个中转站和运输点，把各种运输工具衔接起来，一节倒一节，将农村的山货土特产品和工业原料运往城市，将煤炭和工业品从城市运往农村。
    由于大搞短途运输群众运动，并且组成了短途运输网，黎城已做到了“商业物资无呆滞，工业原料不积压”。今年1—9月全县共完成货运量六万九千三百二十四吨，超过1958年同期的三倍，不仅完成了国家的调运任务，而且直接激励了土特产的生产。自从解决了运输问题后，多种经济得到很大发展。群众反映说：“短途运输作用大，利国又利家，土特产品全推销，群众收入大增加”。
