Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 22nd: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the spokesperson of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam stated at a press conference on the 21st that "the Vietnamese people believe that the agreement signed between the Japanese government and the South Vietnamese authorities on May 13, 1959, is completely invalid."

The spokesperson, Ton Quang Phiet, said that according to the Geneva Accords, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities only had the responsibility of temporarily administering South Vietnam's administration until Vietnam's reunification. He said, therefore, the South Vietnamese authorities "absolutely had no right to represent the entire Vietnam to sign any agreement with the Japanese government regarding Japan's payment of war reparations to Vietnam."

Ton Quang Phiet further pointed out that the war reparations plan of Nobusuke Kishi and Ngo Dinh Diem is an inseparable part of the overall plan of the American imperialists and Japanese monopoly capitalists. Economically, this plan aims to expand Japan's economic power in Southeast Asia. Politically and militarily, this plan shows that the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities collude with each other, blatantly undermine the Geneva Accords, and implement the United States' policy of prolonging the division of Vietnam and establishing a war base in South Vietnam.

He pointed out that "the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believe that all the Vietnamese people have the right to demand that the Japanese government compensate for the losses suffered by the Vietnamese people during World War II due to the Japanese army. The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam know that Japan's payment of war reparations is a burden on the Japanese people. The main thing in the relationship between the two countries is not the payment of war reparations, but the unity of the people of the two countries in the struggle against war and in defense of peace."

    越南国民议会发言人声明
    日本对南越赔偿完全无效
    据新华社河内22日电　据越南通讯社消息，越南民主共和国国民议会发言人21日在记者招待会上说，“越南人民认为，日本政府同南越当局在1959年5月13日签订的协定是完全无效的。”
    发言人孙光阀说，根据日内瓦协议，在越南重新统一以前，吴庭艳当局只有暂时管理南越行政的责任。他说，因此，南越当局“绝对没有权利代表整个越南同日本政府签订任何有关日本向越南支付战争赔偿的协定”。
    孙光阀进一步指出，岸信介和吴庭艳的战争赔偿计划，是美帝国主义者和日本垄断资本家的全面计划中的不可分割的一部分。在经济上，这个计划旨在东南亚扩张日本的经济势力。在政治上和军事上，这个计划表明岸信介政府和吴庭艳当局互相勾结，公然破坏日内瓦协议，实行美国的延长越南的分裂状态和在南越建立战争基地的政策。
    他指出，“越南人民和越南民主共和国政府认为，全体越南人民有权利要求日本政府赔偿日本军队在第二次世界大战期间使越南人民遭受的损失。越南人民和越南民主共和国政府知道，日本支付战争赔偿是日本人民的负担。两国关系中主要的事情不是支付战争赔偿，而是两国人民在反对战争、保卫和平的斗争中的团结一致。”
