    Self-operated Fertilizer Plants Meet Production Needs
    Wuzhong Commune Establishes Plants at All Levels with Clear Division of Labor and Close Cooperation
    Producing 280,000 Jin of Native Fertilizer Daily, Storing Large Amounts of Topdressing Fertilizer for Wheat
    (Our Dispatch) The Wuzhong People's Commune in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has mobilized the masses, adopting the "small-scale indigenous groups" method, and established a complete fertilizer manufacturing network throughout the commune. The commune, production brigade, and production team have 154 fertilizer plants scattered across the area. As of November 3rd, the entire commune had produced more than 6,213,200 jin of various fertilizers, basically sufficient for the first, second, and third topdressings of 24,000 mu of wheat next year. Production is currently continuing at an average daily rate of more than 280,000 jin.
    The fertilizer manufacturing network of the Wuzhong Commune was established during the mass movement of last winter and spring. The center of the fertilizer network is the comprehensive fertilizer plant run by the commune. This factory was originally run by the Xinsheng Agricultural Production Brigade of the Street Management Office. At that time, it specialized in clearing manure and produced a lot of brine fertilizer and three-element fertilizer, and used indigenous methods to manufacture sulfuric acid and indigenous superphosphate of lime. This year, the commune invested 90,000 yuan to expand the scope of production and increase the variety of products. Due to the complexity of technical requirements, the factory was transformed from a brigade-run factory to a commune-run factory. With this factory as the center, the commune also helped the major production brigades and production teams to establish fertilizer plants, assigning fixed personnel and implementing specialized management. The three levels of fertilizer plants cooperated in combat, establishing a complete fertilizer base for the commune. Whatever fertilizer is needed, that is what is produced; however much is needed, that is how much is produced; whenever it is needed, that is when it is produced.
    The three levels of fertilizer plants in the fertilizer manufacturing network have a clear division of labor in production. The comprehensive fertilizer plant run by the commune has relatively advanced equipment, with two sulfuric acid workshops, producing 1,400 tons of concentrated sulfuric acid (98% concentration) annually; and a superphosphate of lime workshop, producing 3,000 tons annually. In addition, it can also produce antibiotic bacteria, soybean rhizobium, and free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The 24 fertilizer plants run by the major production brigades are semi-indigenous and semi-foreign, mainly producing and supplying the topdressing fertilizer needed by their own brigades. According to the growth stage of the crops, they produce "seedling promoting" urea gypsum, "stalk strengthening" three-element fertilizer, "grain filling" indigenous superphosphate of lime, and potassium sulfate for lodging prevention. The 129 fertilizer plants run by the production teams are produced by indigenous methods, mainly producing base fertilizer. They use sheep manure, gypsum, peat, phosphate rock powder, and other mixtures to manufacture three-element fertilizer.
    The three levels of fertilizer plants have a division of labor, but also cooperate closely. The comprehensive fertilizer plant run by the commune helps the major production brigades run fertilizer plants with technology and raw materials. In addition to supplying superphosphate of lime to the entire commune, concentrated sulfuric acid is supplied to the major brigade fertilizer plants as raw material. In terms of technical guidance, in addition to helping the major brigade fertilizer plants master fertilizer manufacturing technology, the comprehensive plant has also trained more than 200 workers from the major brigades and production teams to manufacture indigenous fertilizer in the past year. The fertilizer plants run by the major production brigades, in addition to producing the four types of topdressing fertilizers for seedling promotion, stalk strengthening, grain filling, and lodging prevention according to the season, are also responsible for inspecting and guiding the production of indigenous fertilizer in the production teams. The brigade fertilizer plants are internship schools for the workers of the team indigenous fertilizer plants. Last year, the Third Brigade of Dongta Temple did not know how to produce three-element indigenous fertilizer. Brigade Leader Yuan Kaike and Han Qian, the director of the brigade fertilizer plant, participated in the on-site meeting on the manufacture of indigenous fertilizer convened by the commune in the Zhonghua Brigade. After learning the technology of manufacturing three-element indigenous fertilizer, they immediately transferred 30 commune members from the indigenous fertilizer plants of each production team and concentrated them in the brigade fertilizer plant to learn and do at the same time. Quickly make the three-element indigenous fertilizer bloom everywhere. Thanks to the technical assistance of the major brigade fertilizer plants, the average daily output of the team indigenous fertilizer plants has increased from about 1,000 jin at the beginning of construction to the current 6,000 jin, which is double the planned daily output.
    After so many fertilizer plants were established, the supply of raw materials was a major problem. The commune established two fertilizer raw material bases for these three levels of fertilizer plants: one is a gypsum factory, and the other is a 170-mu peat base. From January to October this year, 3 million jin of gypsum have been brought back from the factory, and 5 million jin have been sold through commercial departments. The factory still has 10 million jin in stock. Recently, the entire commune has transferred 310 vehicles and more than 200 camels, working day and night to bring back gypsum, peat, and sheep manure to supply the various fertilizer plants as raw materials.

    自办化肥厂满足生产需要
    吴忠公社层层建厂分工负责密切配合
    日产土化肥28万斤为小麦储大量追肥
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区吴忠人民公社发动群众，采取小土群的办法，在全公社范围内，建立起来一个完整的化肥制造网。公社、大队、小队的一百五十四个化肥厂，星罗棋布。到11月3日，全公社已生产各种化肥六百二十一万三千二百多斤，明年两万四千亩小麦的第一、二、三次追肥，已经基本够用。现在正以平均日产二十八万多斤的速度继续生产。
    吴忠公社的化肥制造网，是去冬今春大搞群众运动中建立起来的。化肥网的中心是公社办的综合肥料厂。这个工厂原来是街道管理处的新生农业生产大队办的。当时专管清除粪便，去年生产了很多卤水肥、三要素肥，并用土法制造硫酸和土过磷酸钙。今年公社投资九万元，生产范围扩大，产品增多，技术要求复杂，就由队办工厂转为社办工厂。公社以这个厂为中心，又帮助各大队和各小队普遍建立了化肥厂，固定专人，实行专业经营。三级化肥厂配合作战，给公社建立了一个完整的化肥基地。需要啥肥生产啥肥，需要多少生产多少，啥时要啥时生产。
    化肥制造网中的三级化肥厂，在生产上有明确的分工。公社办的综合肥料厂，设备比较先进，有两个硫酸车间，年产浓硫酸（浓度达98％）一千四百吨；还有一个过磷酸钙车间，年产三千吨。另外，还能生产抗生菌、大豆根瘤菌和自生固氮菌。各生产大队办的二十四个化肥厂，是半土半洋的，主要生产和供应本大队所需要的追肥。按照作物生长阶段，生产“攻苗”的尿素石膏，“攻秆”的三要素肥，“攻粒”的土过磷酸钙，防倒伏的硫酸钾。各生产小队办的一百二十九个化肥厂，是土法生产的，主要是生产基肥。用羊粪、石膏、草炭、磷矿石粉等混合制造三要素肥。
    三级化肥厂有分工，但也密切合作。公社办的综合肥料厂，从技术上、原料上帮助各大队办化肥厂。生产的产品，除了过磷酸钙供应全公社需要外，浓硫酸供应各大队化肥厂作原料。在技术指导上，综合厂除了帮助各大队的化肥厂掌握制造化肥技术，一年来还给各大队和各小队培训了制造土化肥的工人二百多名。各大队办的化肥厂，除了按季节生产攻苗、攻秆、攻粒、防倒伏的四种追肥外，还负责检查和指导各生产小队的土化肥生产。大队的化肥厂，是小队土化肥厂职工的实习学校。去年，东塔寺第三大队，不会生产三要素土化肥。大队长袁开科和大队化肥厂厂长韩谦，参加了公社在中华大队召开的制造土化肥现场会议，学会了制造三要素土化肥技术以后，马上从各生产小队土化肥厂抽调三十个社员，集中在大队的化肥厂，边学边做，很快使三要素土化肥遍地开花。由于各大队化肥厂在技术上的帮助，使各小队土化肥厂的平均日产量，由初建时的一千斤左右，提高到现在的六千斤，比计划日产量提高一倍。
    这么多化肥厂办起来以后，原料供应是个大问题，公社为这三级化肥厂建立了两个制肥原料基地：一个是石膏厂，一个是一百七十亩大的草炭基地。从今年元月到10月，已经从厂里拉回石膏三百万斤，通过商业部门卖出五百万斤，现在厂里还存有一千万斤。最近，全公社抽调了三百一十辆车、二百多峰骆驼，日夜不停地往回拉石膏、草炭和羊粪，供各个化肥厂作原料。
