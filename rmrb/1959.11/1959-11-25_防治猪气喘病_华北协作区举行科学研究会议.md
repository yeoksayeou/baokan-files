Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, November 24th: The North China Cooperation Zone's scientific research conference on preventing and controlling swine enzootic pneumonia, involving the provinces, cities, and autonomous region of Hebei, Shanxi, Beijing, and Inner Mongolia, was held in Hohhot from the 17th to the 22nd.

The conference decided to mobilize relevant scientific researchers and animal husbandry and veterinary cadres to actively conduct investigations and research into swine enzootic pneumonia to understand its development patterns; to widely mobilize the masses to participate in epidemic prevention work, publicize effective prevention and control experiences from various regions, and comprehensively control the epidemic's prevalence; to further develop the mutual support and cooperative relationships between the four fraternal provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and to regularly exchange scientific data and work experience in order to eliminate swine enzootic pneumonia in the North China region as soon as possible.

The conference pointed out that at present, the collective pig raising by people's communes is developing rapidly. Extra vigilance and resolute control of the prevalence and spread of swine enzootic pneumonia are directly related to the further development of the pig raising industry. Therefore, the conference demanded that scientific and technical personnel and veterinary personnel thoroughly oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost their morale, go deep into the epidemic areas, conduct careful investigation and research, mobilize and lead the masses to take effective prevention and control measures in light of local conditions, and promptly summarize and promote experience, making unremitting efforts to eliminate swine enzootic pneumonia as soon as possible.
