Title: US Economic Status Increasingly Shaken: Gold Flows Out Steadily, Dollar Declines Step by Step

    The American monetary expert Franz Pick worriedly said at the National Conference of the American Trade Relations Committee on October 28: "The outflow of gold from the United States has the danger of causing a 'monetary shock' and may 'shake the capitalist world'."
    Pick said that the dollar, once the most powerful, has been reduced to a "second-class" currency. Taking 1940 as the standard, the purchasing power of one dollar today has been reduced to less than forty-seven cents, and it may fall below forty cents again. He said: "The rate of dollar devaluation averages 3% per year."
    According to Pick's estimate, the reduction in US exports may increase the US international balance of payments deficit this year from the originally expected $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion, and this huge deficit can ultimately only be paid off with gold reserves.
    He said that the United States' gold reserves have shrunk from $24.6 billion in 1949 to $19.4 billion today. Because foreign governments hold approximately $12 billion in "dollar deposits that can be notified for equivalent gold at any time", foreign private short-term deposits in the United States that can be withdrawn at any time amount to $6 billion, in addition to one-quarter of the US paper currency in circulation (approximately $32 billion), about $8 billion, must be supplemented with gold. "Therefore, theoretically, we already owe about $7 billion."
    Finally, Pick said: "If our gold loss increases by another one or one and a half billion dollars, we may fall into a gold disaster. If we then announce a ban on gold exports, a monetary earthquake will shake the capitalist world."
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington: A commentary published by the United States Information Agency, the official US propaganda agency, on November 1, stated that "the United States' balance of payments has recently maintained a large deficit, which is a matter of increasing concern in Washington."
    The commentary continued: "In the post-war period, the usual annual deficit for the United States was one to two billion dollars, but last year it increased to 3.4 billion dollars. This year, the deficit has not only not decreased, but is rising. It is estimated that the deficit for the entire year of 1959 will reach more than four billion dollars. Therefore, US government officials have been studying ways to reduce overseas dollar expenditures and alleviate the balance of payments situation."
    The basic situation of the US international balance of payments after the war is: a huge amount of funds are used annually for overseas military expenditures (bases, garrisons, and other military expenditures) and military and economic "aid" expenditures to foreign countries for US military and political purposes. These expenditures are entirely offset by the large trade surplus obtained by the United States due to its dominant position in the capitalist world market. However, due to the uneven development of capitalist countries, other major countries in the capitalist world have greatly strengthened their trade competition with the United States in recent years, so the US foreign trade situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable. In 1957, the US trade surplus was 6.5 billion US dollars, which decreased to 3.5 billion US dollars in 1958, and in the first half of this year, the surplus was only 700 million US dollars (there was even an import surplus in June for the first time in peacetime since 1937), and it is expected that the surplus for the whole year will only be 1 billion US dollars. In this way, it cannot make up for the aforementioned huge overseas expenditures, resulting in a large outflow of gold. Last year, the total outflow of gold was 2,275 million US dollars, and another 837 million US dollars flowed out in the first half of this year.
    Recently, Western news agencies and newspapers have reported that this situation has caused panic among the US ruling group. Under the chairmanship of Treasury Secretary Anderson, the US government is stepping up its research on countermeasures. Anderson made it clear that he believes that the huge deficit in the US international balance of payments is "intolerable." US President Eisenhower also expressed "serious concern" about this issue at a recent press conference. American newspapers pointed out that the US government is deeply concerned that the development of the US international balance of payments deficit may force the devaluation of the dollar, thereby greatly weakening the international "prestige" and economic status of the United States.
    This is a table of the US international balance of payments deficit in recent years published by the British "Economist" magazine on October 31. After World War II, US foreign trade and international payments maintained a large surplus. However, since 1954, except for 1957, the US international payments have shown an increasingly large deficit. In the second quarter of this year, the payment deficit was as high as 1 billion US dollars. This shows its seriousness from the table above.

### 美国经济地位震荡日甚  黄金源源外流　美元步步下跌

    美国经济地位震荡日甚
    黄金源源外流　美元步步下跌
    本报讯　美国货币专家弗朗茨·皮克10月28日在美国贸易关系委员会全国性会议上忧心忡忡地说：“美国的黄金外流有引起‘货币震荡’的危险，并且可能‘动摇资本主义世界’。”
    皮克说，曾经一度是最有力的美元已沦为“二等”货币。如以1940年为标准，今天一块美元的购买力已降低到不足四毛七分，而且有可能再跌到四毛以下。他说：“美元贬值的速度平均为每年3％。
    据皮克估计，美国出口的减缩可能使今年的美国国际收支逆差从原来预料的四十五亿美元增至五十五亿美元，而这一庞大赤字归根到底只有用黄金储备来偿付。
    他说，美国的黄金储备额已从1949年的二百四十六亿美元减缩到今天的一百九十四亿美元。由于外国政府拥有“可以随时通知以相等黄金提取的美元存款”约计为一百二十亿美元，外国在美国随时可提取的私人短期存款有六十亿美元，此外再加上美国纸币流通额（约三百二十亿美元）的四分之一约八十亿美元必须以黄金补进，“因此在理论上说，我们已亏欠约七十亿美元”。
    最后皮克说：“如果我们的黄金亏损再加十亿或十五亿美元，我们就可能陷于一场黄金灾难之中，如果我们随着就宣布禁止黄金出口，一场货币的地震就要震撼资本主义世界”。
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国官方宣传机构美国新闻处1日发表的一篇评论写道，“美国的对外收支近来一直保持很大的逆差，这是华盛顿方面越来越关心的问题。”
    这篇评论接着说：“在战后，美国每年通常的逆差为十亿到二十亿美元，而去年却增加为三十四亿美元。今年的逆差不但没有下降，反而在上升。估计1959年全年逆差将达四十亿美元以上。因此，美国政府官员一直在研究减少海外美元开支和缓和对外收支情况的办法”。
    战后美国国际收支的基本情况是：每年把巨额款项用于海外军事开支（基地、驻军和其他军事开支）和为了达到美国军事、政治目的而给予外国的军事经济“援助”开支，这些开支全靠美国由于在资本主义世界市场上占统治地位而取得的大量贸易出超来弥补。但是，由于资本主义国家发展的不平衡，近年来资本主义世界其他主要国家已经大大加强它们对美国的贸易竞争力量，因此美国对外贸易情况正愈来愈不利。1957年美国贸易出超是六十五亿美元，1958年减少到三十五亿美元，而今年上半年出超只有七亿美元（6月份甚至出现了1937年来和平时期第一次出现的入超），预计全年将只出超十亿美元。这样，就弥补不了上述的巨额海外开支，造成大量黄金外流。去年全年外流的黄金是二十二亿七千五百万美元，今年上半年又流出八亿三千七百万美元。
    最近西方通讯社和报刊纷纷报道说，这种情况已经在美国统治集团中引起了惊惶。在财政部长安德逊的主持下，美国政府正在加紧研究对策。安德逊明白表示，他认为美国国际收支的庞大赤字是“不能忍受的”。美国总统艾森豪威尔也在最近举行的一次记者招待会上对这个问题表示“认真的关切”。美国报刊指出，美国政府深深耽心，美国国际收支逆差发展下去将可能迫使美元贬值，从而大大削弱美国的国际“威信”和经济地位。
    这是英国“经济学家”杂志10月31日发表的近年来美国国际收支差额表。第二次世界大战以后，美国对外贸易和国际支付一直保持着很大的顺差。但自1954年起，除1957年外，美国国际支付出现日益扩大的逆差。今年第二季度支付逆差高达十亿美元。这从上表中可以看出其严重性。
