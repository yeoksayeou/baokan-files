Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou — Meng County, Henan Province, harvested an average yield of 410 jin per mu from its 6,531 mu of valuable medicinal raw rehmannia, with the total output increasing by 1.3 times compared to the historical high in 1957.

Meng County is a major production area for raw rehmannia, with a planting history of six to seven hundred years, producing rehmannia roots that are large, thin-skinned, fine-grained, and oily.

This year, all of Meng County's more than 6,500 mu of raw rehmannia were planted on garden-style land that could be irrigated, drained, and had fertile soil, ensuring good harvests regardless of drought or flood. In the face of an extraordinary drought of one hundred days without rain, the fields were watered six or seven times at appropriate intervals and in appropriate amounts, and fertilized five times. Furthermore, the local "Golden Scholar" improved variety, cultivated in recent years, was selected, and the planting density was changed from 4,000 plants per mu to 6,000 plants per mu, and insect pests were treated in a timely manner, thus achieving a bumper harvest.

    孟县生地产量打破历史最高纪录
    据新华社郑州讯　河南省孟县种植的六千五百三十一亩名贵药材生地，获得平均亩产四百一十斤的丰收，总产量比历史上最高的1957年增长了一点三倍。
    孟县是生地的主要产区，有六、七百年的种植历史，所产生地个头大、皮薄、肉细、油性大。
    今年，孟县全县六千五百多亩生地都种在能灌、能排、土地肥沃、旱涝保丰收的园田化土地上，在百日无雨的特大干旱面前，适时适量地浇水六、七次，施肥五次，并且选用了当地近几年来培育的“金状元”良种，改每亩稀植四千株为密植六千株，及时除治了虫害，因此获得丰收。
