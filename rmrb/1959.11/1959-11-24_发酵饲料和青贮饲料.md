Small Knowledge

    Fermentation and silage are two methods of storing and preparing green fodder and coarser feed. Treating green and coarse feed with these two methods can not only turn things pigs don't like to eat into things pigs love to eat, but also improve their quality or preserve their original nutritional value.
    Fermented feed is made through the action of yeast. Wild vegetables, green grass, vegetable scraps, leaves, radish greens, etc., and some coarse feeds such as soybean fuzz, grain chaff, sorghum shells, buckwheat flowers, etc., can all be used as raw materials for making fermented feed. In some areas, bran and other more refined feeds are also fermented and then fed to pigs.
    Many feeds become softer in fiber and have a fragrant and sour taste after fermentation, which is very beneficial for pigs to eat. According to the experience of Huadushi Farm in Ongniud Banner, Inner Mongolia, using fermented feed to feed pigs has the following advantages: first, it saves more than 1,580 yuan in feed costs in more than three months; second, it reduces the occurrence of pig diseases; third, it can promote early estrus in sows, increase milk production, and improve the survival rate of piglets.
    The fermentation method for green feed is as follows: remove impurities from the green feed, chop it up and pack it firmly in jars or fermentation tanks, then press it tightly with stones and fill it with clean water. The fermentation time is generally four to five days. Fermented feed can be made and used immediately, or more can be made in seasons with abundant raw materials for later use.
    The fermentation of coarse feed is generally carried out in pre-dug cellars. Before entering the cellar, remove the broken stalks, long grass, and soil mixed in the coarse feed, and then mix in the appropriate amount of water. When entering the cellar, fill it in layer by layer and step on it firmly. After the cellar is full, cover it with a layer of wet grass and then cover it with about three feet of soil. The fermentation period of coarse feed is generally three to five months. The Bihuzao made by farmers in Liaoning Province is a type of fermented coarse feed.
    Mixing green feed with bran and wheat bran for fermentation involves layering green feed and bran/wheat bran in jars or specially designed pools.
    Silage is made by treating clean, chopped green fodder that can be fed to pigs and storing it in silage cellars or silage towers, through the action of lactic acid bacteria. The greatest advantage of using the silage method to make feed is that it can preserve more of the original nutrients in the feed. Fresh green fodder is rich in vitamins and easily digestible proteins, fats, sugars, etc. If it is preserved by drying, these nutrients will be greatly reduced with the loss of moisture and the effects of sunlight and bacterial activity. Taking the carotene contained in sweet potato vines as an example, air-drying results in a loss of over 95%, while silage only results in a slight reduction.
    The silage method is generally applicable to the lush growing season of plants in summer or the mature season of crops in autumn. At present, some areas in the south are still harvesting major autumn crops and autumn vegetables, and some areas in the north are processing cabbages, radishes, etc. for storage in cellars. Such areas can combine autumn harvest and winter storage to collect and store winter feed for pigs using silage or fermentation methods.
    The fermentation method can generally be used in all seasons. Feed fermentation requires a certain temperature, and attention should be paid to insulation and the addition of substances that promote fermentation when carried out in colder seasons. Most areas are currently carrying out autumn harvesting and threshing, which is a great opportunity to collect and make fermented coarse feed.

    发酵饲料和青贮饲料
    发酵和青贮是贮藏、调剂青饲料和较粗的饲料的两种方法。用这两种方法处理青、粗饲料，不仅可以把猪不太爱吃的东西变成猪爱吃的东西，而且可以提高它们的品质或是保存住它们原有的营养价值。
    发酵饲料是通过酵母的作用制成的。野菜、青草、蔬菜的下脚菜，树叶、萝卜缨等和部分粗饲料如豆毛子、谷秕子、高粱壳、荞麦花等，都可以做为制做发酵饲料的原料。有些地区，也有把糠、麸等较精的饲料发酵后喂猪的。
    许多饲料经过发酵，纤维变软，味道变香、变酸，猪吃了以后好处很多。据内蒙古翁牛特旗花都什农场的经验，用发酵饲料喂猪，第一，在三个多月里节省饲料费一千五百八十多元；第二，减少了猪的疫病的发生；第三，母猪吃了能够促进早期发情，增加泌乳量，提高了仔猪的成活率。
    青饲料的发酵方法是：把青饲料除去杂质、切碎装在缸里或发酵池里踏实，然后用石头压紧，倒满清水。发酵的时间一般是四、五天。发酵饲料可以随制随用，也可以在原料多的季节多制一些备用。
    粗饲料的发酵一般在预先挖好的窖里进行。入窖以前，先把掺在粗饲料里的碎秸秆、长草和土除掉，然后拌合适当的水分。入窖的时候一层一层地填入、踩实。窖满以后先盖一层湿草，再复土三尺左右。粗饲料的发酵期，一般是三到五个月。辽宁等省农民制做的秕糊糟，就是发酵粗饲料的一种。
    青饲料和糠、麸混合发酵是一层青饲料一层糠、麸，在缸里或特设的池里都可以调制。
    青贮是把可以喂猪的青饲料处理干净、切碎装在青贮窖或青贮塔里，通过乳酸菌的作用而制作成的。用青贮方法制做饲料的最大好处是能够较多地保存饲料中原有的养分。新鲜的青绿饲料中含有丰富的维生素和容易消化的蛋白、脂肪、糖类等。如果用干燥的办法保存，这些养分就会随着水分的消失和阳光晒、细菌活动等作用而大量减少。以甘薯藤蔓所含的胡萝卜素说，风干的损失95％以上，青贮的只微有减少。
    青贮的方法一般适用于植物生长茂盛的夏季或农作物成熟的秋季。目前南方部分地区还在收获大秋作物和秋菜，北方一些地区正在处理入窖的白菜萝卜等。这样的地区可以结合秋收、冬藏用青贮或发酵的方法为猪收贮过冬饲料。
    发酵的方法一般是四季可用。饲料发酵需要一定的温度，在较冷季节进行，应注意保温和适当加入促使发酵的东西。目前大部分地区都在进行秋收的脱粒打场，正是收集制做发酵粗饲料的大好时机。
