Xinhua News Agency, London, November 17th: West German Chancellor Adenauer received a cold reception in London today.

When British Prime Minister Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Lloyd went to the station to greet Adenauer, there was no welcoming ceremony and no speeches were made. There were only two or three hundred people welcoming him, most of whom were West German expatriates in London. There was no cheering, no band, just silence, only the whirring of newsreel cameras could be heard.

In the evening, Londoners marched in heavy rain from Hyde Park to Adenauer's residence to protest his visit.

The demonstrators carried torches and held placards with slogans such as "Adenauer go home" and "Dismiss Nazi ministers." They shouted: "No hydrogen bombs for Nazi generals!" "Adenauer wants the Cold War! We want a summit!"

They also held a rally, at which they unanimously passed a resolution telling Adenauer to stop trying to delay an early summit. The resolution was handed over to the West German Embassy in the United Kingdom by a three-person delegation.

This newspaper reports: On November 17, West German Chancellor Adenauer arrived in London for a three-day state visit. This meeting between the two countries will be another important round in their struggle for Western European hegemony.

Adenauer's visit was originally scheduled for last year. However, due to the extremely deteriorated relations between Britain and West Germany at the time, Adenauer deliberately postponed the visit. Over the past year, the rivalry between West Germany and Britain has undergone two changes. Initially, West Germany and France formed the "Common Market," establishing the Paris-Bonn axis, greatly weakening Britain's economic power and political influence in Western Europe. Adenauer once said triumphantly that the British must know that West Germany and France, not Britain, are now leading Western Europe. However, Britain has now basically formed the "Small Free Trade Area" to counter the "Common Market," posing a serious threat to West Germany's market in Europe. Moreover, Britain's proactive stance on East-West relations has been welcomed by broad Western public opinion, placing Britain in an advantageous international position. At the same time, contradictions within the Paris-Bonn axis have also been developing. All of this is clearly beneficial to Britain. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd's visit to Paris on the eve of Adenauer's visit to Britain to woo Adenauer's ally, de Gaulle, was not without purpose.

On the eve of his visit to London, Adenauer, in an interview with reporters from the British "Manchester Guardian" and "Sunday Times," tried his best to emphasize that the two countries "must establish friendly relations" and "maintain a truly lasting understanding." On the same day, West German Foreign Minister Brentano also said that West Germany would continue to improve its relations with Britain. But in reality, he wanted to make some deals and start a new round of rivalry.

According to reports, Adenauer's visit to Britain mainly involved three issues: the "Common Market" and Britain's "Small Free Trade Area"; Britain's attitude towards establishing a disengagement zone in Central Europe; and the East-West summit.

The confrontation between the "Common Market" and Britain's "Small Free Trade Area" is a major contradiction between the two countries. The British "Sunday Times" put it bluntly: "In economic terms, our (West Germany and Britain) relationship is mainly one of competitors, with both countries seeking to seize each other's markets and the world market." Because Britain's organization of the "Small Free Trade Area" has seriously undermined West Germany's expansion to the Outer Seven countries, the pressure from West Germany's domestic economic circles to expand the European trade zone together with Britain is increasing. A few days ago, the heads of government of the four West German coastal states jointly requested Adenauer to "vigorously encourage and support all negotiations on the establishment of a large European free trade zone." According to foreign newspapers, Adenauer is also prepared to make "economic concessions" to Britain, but at the same time, Adenauer stated that this "concession" cannot harm the "close cooperation" of the six "Common Market" countries in political terms, especially the Bonn-Paris axis. Britain saw through Adenauer's intentions at a glance. The "Sunday Times" said that British Foreign Office experts believe that the "economic concessions" that West Germany is willing to make are also aimed at splitting the free trade area of the "Outer Seven."

On the issue of establishing a disengagement zone in Central Europe, which Adenauer strongly opposes, the British government's attitude was once ambiguous. However, not long ago, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, in his policy statement, emphasized that the government still believes that finding a way to establish a region in Central Europe with reduced tensions and limited armaments is a good idea. But Adenauer, in his conversation with British reporters, said in response to this argument that the proposal to implement isolation "is obviously wrong."

On the issue of the East-West summit, the differences between West Germany and France "standing together" and London are "very sharp" (West German "Parliamentary Political News"). Although Britain has had to make concessions to the views of France and West Germany on the timing of the East-West summit, the two sides have not yet reached agreement on the agenda of the meeting. Adenauer, in his conversation with British reporters, emphasized that the agenda of the East-West summit "should first discuss the issue of complete and supervised disarmament of nuclear weapons and conventional weapons." He also demanded that the West take a "firm stance" on the West Berlin issue, but British newspapers believe that "some kind of temporary agreement on the Berlin issue is necessary" ("Observer"). The British Conservative Party's "Daily Express" even deliberately put Adenauer on the spot. It said: Just talking about disarmament will not alleviate people's well-founded concerns about German militarism, "on the contrary, the specific signs of German rearmament are even more disturbing."

Therefore, many Western political figures believe that this meeting "may prove to be much more difficult than once expected" (Reuters). It is worth noting that just as Adenauer was about to go to London, West Germany's "Cologne Review," under Adenauer's instructions, wrote an article clamoring that "Britain must finally realize that in America and in Europe, the will of the British is no longer a dominant force." This has further aroused British suspicion. The British right-wing "Daily Express" said: "The British will treat Adenauer's visit with caution."

### 争夺西欧霸权的两大对手狭路相逢  阿登纳凄风苦雨到伦敦  伦敦示威群众振臂高呼“阿登纳滚回去”

    争夺西欧霸权的两大对手狭路相逢
    阿登纳凄风苦雨到伦敦
    伦敦示威群众振臂高呼“阿登纳滚回去”
    新华社伦敦17日电　西德总理阿登纳今天在伦敦受到了冷淡的接待。
    当英国首相麦克米伦和外交大臣劳埃德前往车站欢迎阿登纳时，没有欢迎仪式，也没有发表讲话。欢迎的群众只有二三百人，其中大多是在伦敦的西德侨民。群众中没有欢呼声，也没有乐队，一片静悄悄，只听到新闻电影摄影机的旋转声。
    入晚，伦敦人在倾盆大雨中从海德公园列队前往阿登纳住处，抗议他来访问。
    示威的群众拿着火炬，手执写着“阿登纳滚回去”、“解除纳粹部长的职务”等字样的标语牌。他们高呼：“不许把氢弹交给纳粹将军！”“阿登纳要冷战！我们要最高级会议！”
    他们还举行了集会，在会上一致通过决议，告诉阿登纳不要再企图推迟早日召开最高级会议。这项决议由一个三人代表团交给西德驻英国大使馆。
  本报讯　11月17日西德总理阿登纳抵达伦敦，作为期三天的国事访问。这次两国会谈，将成为它们争夺西欧霸权的角斗中又一重要回合。
    本来阿登纳这次访问早在去年就要进行。但是由于当时英国、西德关系极度恶化，阿登纳故意推迟了这次访问。一年来，西德和英国的角斗经历了两度的变化。开始是西德和法国组成了“共同市场”，建立了巴黎—波恩轴心，大大削弱了英国在西欧大陆的经济势力和政治影响。阿登纳曾经洋洋得意地说，英国人必须知道，现在领导西欧的已经不是英国，而是西德和法国了。但是现在英国也已经基本上组成对抗“共同市场”的“小自由贸易区”，给西德在欧洲的市场造成严重的威胁。而英国在东西方关系上采取的一些主动，由于受到西方广大舆论的欢迎，使英国在国际上处于有利的地位。同时这时期在巴黎—波恩轴心内部矛盾也在发展。这一切显然对于英国是有利的。英国外交大臣劳埃德在阿登纳访英前夕到巴黎去向阿登纳的盟友戴高乐进行拉拢不是没有目的的。
    在访问伦敦前夕，阿登纳向英国“曼彻斯特卫报”和“星期日泰晤士报”记者发表的谈话中，竭力强调两国“必须建立友好关系”、“保持真正的持久的谅解”。同一天西德外长勃伦塔诺也说要继续改善西德同英国的关系。但实际上是想作些交易，展开新的角斗。
    据报道，这次阿登纳访英主要跟英国商谈三方面的问题：“共同市场”和英国“小自由贸易区”问题；英国关于建立中欧脱离接触区的态度以及东西方最高级会议问题。
    “共同市场”和英国的“小自由贸易区”的对垒是两国的重大矛盾。英国“星期日泰晤士报”说得很坦率：“在经济上，我们（西德和英国）的关系主要是竞争者的关系，两国同样都是谋求夺取对方市场和世界市场的工业国”。由于英国组织“小自由贸易区”严重打击了西德对外部七国的扩张。目前西德国内经济界要求和英国一起扩大欧洲贸易区的压力正在加重。前几天西德沿海四州的政府首脑已联名要求阿登纳“竭力鼓励和支持一切关于建立大的欧洲自由贸易区的谈判。”据外国报纸报道，阿登纳也准备向英国作出“经济让步”，但是同时阿登纳表示这种“让步”不能损害“共同市场”六国在政治方面的“密切合作”，特别是不能损害波恩—巴黎轴心。英国一眼看穿了阿登纳的打算。“星期日泰晤士报”说，英国外交部专家认为，西德愿意作出的“经济让步”，其目的也是在于分裂“外部七国”的自由贸易区。
    在阿登纳强烈反对的建立中欧脱离接触区的问题上，英国政府前一时期的态度曾经表现得暧昧不明。但是不久前英国外交大臣劳埃德在他的政策声明中强调：政府仍然认为，设法在中欧建立一个紧张局势缓和的以及军备有限制的地区是个好主意。但是阿登纳在向英国记者的谈话中针对这种论调说：实行隔离的主张“是显然错误的”。
    在东西方最高级会议问题上，西德和法国“站在一起同伦敦之间的分歧十分尖锐”（西德“议会政治新闻”）。虽然英国目前在召开东西方最高级会议的时间上，不得不向法国和西德的观点表示让步，但是对会议的议程双方还未取得一致。阿登纳在向英国记者的谈话中强调，东西方最高级会议的议程“首先应该讨论的是有监督的核武器和常规武器的全面裁军问题”。他并要求西方对西柏林问题采取“坚定立场”，可是英国的报纸却认为“就柏林问题达成某种临时协议是必要的”（“观察家报”）。英国保守党的“每日快报”甚至故意将阿登纳的军。它说：仅仅谈一下裁军问题，并不会减轻人民对德国军国主义的很有根据的不安，“正相反，德国重新武装的具体迹象更使人们感到不安。”
    因此，许多西方政界人士认为这次会谈“可能证明比一度预料的还要困难得多”（路透社）。值得注意的是，正当阿登纳去伦敦前夕，西德的“科隆评论”却在阿登纳的授意之下写了一篇文章叫嚣“英国终于必须了解到，在美洲和在欧洲，英国人的意愿不再是一种支配力量了。”这就更加引起英国的疑虑。英国右翼的“每日快报”说：“英国人将小心翼翼地对待阿登纳的访问。”
