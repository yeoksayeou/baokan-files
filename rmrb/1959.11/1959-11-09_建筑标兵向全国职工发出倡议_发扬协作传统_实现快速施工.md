Xinhua News Agency, 8th: More than 500 representatives attending the National Heroes Conference and Advanced Experience Exchange Meeting of the Construction System concluded their experience exchange activities on the 7th and issued a proposal to workers on the national construction industry front. The proposal called on workers on the construction industry front to hold high the red flag of the General Line, continue to develop the magnificent new upsurge of the increasing production and practicing economy movement that has already formed, ensure the overfulfillment of this year's construction and installation plan, and achieve a "good start" next year.

The proposal requires workers in building materials production enterprises to immediately launch a major battle for high quality and high output, continue to implement the policy of walking on two legs, with both "large foreign groups" and "small foreign groups" increasing production together, and ensure the overfulfillment of the planned increase in production. In terms of urban construction, we must continue to do everything possible to solve the difficulties of insufficient materials and equipment, and strive to complete this year's municipal construction tasks to ensure the smooth progress of industrial construction. In terms of survey and design, we must engage in rapid design, ensuring that surveying does not delay design, and design does not delay construction. The proposal also called on construction workers to regard vigorously supporting agriculture as an important task, and actively help rural areas carry out technical transformation and construction.

Since the Great Leap Forward last year, a large number of advanced units and advanced producers have emerged on the construction industry front. There are advanced model workers and good experiences in every aspect and every type of work. At this advanced experience exchange meeting of the construction engineering system, representatives widely summarized and exchanged specific experiences in various aspects in the form of discussions, visits, and on-site operational performances, making these experiences richer and more complete.

The concentrated manifestation of construction and installation enterprises implementing the General Line is to engage in rapid construction. The Great Hall of the People, with an area of more than 170,000 square meters, was completed in just over ten months, which is an example of achieving a comprehensive victory of more, faster, better, and more economical through rapid construction. Liu Zhixian, the representative of the Beijing No. 1 Construction Engineering Company, who was in charge of the main attack in the construction of the Great Hall of the People, introduced at this meeting his experience in carrying out rapid construction by holding high the red flag of the General Line, launching mass movements, and engaging in communist collaboration, which was highly valued by the representatives. Zhang Baifa, the leader of the steel bar workers' youth shock team of the Beijing No. 3 Construction Engineering Company, who led the entire team to complete seven years of tasks in four and a half years, introduced his experience in organizing construction at the experience exchange meeting. Their team only had fifty-three people, but because they did not waste time or work hours, and seized every minute, they were able to complete any difficult task excellently. Advanced producers from Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Heilongjiang and other places have realized the "complete set" of machinery in these types of work, which used to rely heavily on manual operation, by vigorously creating machinery. The Lushan Steel Bar Workers Youth Shock Team of Tianjin No. 6 Construction Engineering Company created and improved 29 machines, which basically realized the mechanization of the entire set of processes from straightening, cutting, forming, and welding steel bars to finished products. In the past, it took an average of eleven workers, up to twenty-eight workers, to process one ton of steel bars, but now it only takes two and a half to three and a half workers. Feng Tianxi, the paint foreman of the Shanxi No. 5 Construction Company, introduced to the representatives their experience in breaking through the circle of single-type work technology, painstakingly studying hard, and finally becoming a "red, diligent, and skillful" all-rounder work team. In the past, their team had too detailed a division of labor, and they were only busy for two or three months a year. They were not satisfied with this situation of "the old cow chasing the rabbit, having strength but unable to use it," and they went wherever there was a shortage of people, and learned whatever work there was. Now they have a relatively familiar grasp of more than forty technologies in twenty types of work such as asphalt, glass, lifting, and hoisting. Over the past five years, they have overfulfilled the state plan every month, season, and year. Their experiences were welcomed by the representatives.

Representatives of building materials production enterprises also exchanged their experiences in high output and high quality at the meeting. The Li Xihua kiln head team of the Mudanjiang Cement Plant conscientiously implemented the advanced operating methods of "three big and one fast" (big wind, big fire, big material, fast operation), and created the national record for the hourly output of cement kilns. The Tibetan youth Si Date shock team of the Danba Mica Mine in Sichuan recently blasted more than 13,000 cubic meters in one large blast, increasing efficiency by more than ten times compared with ordinary blasting methods.

Liu Yumin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, spoke on the day the advanced experience exchange meeting of the construction system ended. He said that this meeting is of great significance for carrying out the competition to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward in the construction industry more widely and deeply, and to achieve continuous leap forward. He hoped that all representatives would continue to play a backbone role, a leading role, and a bridge role, and lead construction workers to create more brilliant achievements.

    建筑标兵向全国职工发出倡议
    发扬协作传统　实现快速施工
    据新华社8日讯　出席全国群英会建筑系统先进经验交流会的五百多名代表，7日结束了经验交流活动，向全国建筑工业战线上职工发出倡议书。倡议书号召建筑工业战线上的职工，高举总路线的红旗，把已经形成的波澜壮阔的增产节约运动新高潮，持续不断地发展下去，保证超额完成今年的建筑安装计划，做到明年“开门红”。
    倡议书要求建筑材料生产企业的职工，立即展开一个优质高产的大战役，继续贯彻两条腿走路的方针，“大洋群”和“小洋群”一齐增产，保证超额完成预定的增产计划。在城市建设方面，要继续千方百计地解决材料、设备不足的困难，力争完成今年的市政建设任务，保证工业建设的顺利进行。在勘察设计方面，要大搞快速设计，做到勘察不误设计，设计不误施工。倡议书并且号召建筑业职工，要把大力支援农业当作自己的一项重要任务，积极帮助农村进行技术改造和建设事业。
    去年大跃进以来，建筑工业战线涌现了大批先进单位和先进生产者，每一个方面，每一个工种都有了先进的标兵和好经验。在这次建筑工程系统先进经验交流会上，代表们以座谈、参观、现场操作表演等形式，广泛地总结和交流了各方面的具体经验，使这些经验更加丰富，更加完善。
    建筑安装企业贯彻总路线的集中表现，就是大搞快速施工。面积达十七万多平方米的人民大会堂用短短的十个多月的时间建成，是实行快速施工获得多快好省全面胜利的一个范例。在人民大会堂的建筑中担任主攻任务的北京市第一建筑工程公司的代表刘志贤，在这次会议上介绍的他们高举总路线的红旗、大搞群众运动、大搞共产主义协作进行快速施工的经验，受到了代表们的极大重视。领导全队以四年半的时间完成七年任务的北京市第三建筑工程公司钢筋工青年突击队长张百发，在经验交流会上介绍了他组织施工的经验。他们全队只有五十三个人，因为做到不窝工，不浪费工时，争分夺秒，所以再困难的任务交到他们手里都能够出色地完成。北京、上海、天津、黑龙江等地的先进生产者由于大力创造机具，已经在这些过去大部依靠手工操作的工种中，实现了机具的“配套成龙”。天津市第六建筑工程公司芦珊钢筋工青年突击队，创造和改进了二十九台机械，使钢筋从平直、切断、成型、电焊到成品一整套工序都基本上实现了机械化，过去加工一吨钢筋平均要十一个工，最高要二十八个工，现在只要两个半到三个半工了。山西省第五建筑公司油工队长冯天喜，向代表们介绍了他们冲破单一工种技术的圈子，千方百计地苦学苦钻，终于成为一支“红、勤、巧”多面手工作队的经验。他们队过去专业分工太细，一年四季只忙两三个月。他们不安于这种“老牛追兔子，有劲使不上”的局面，哪里缺人就到哪里干，干什么活就学什么活。现在他们已经比较熟悉地掌握了沥青、玻璃、起重、吊装等二十个工种的四十多项技术，五年来月月、季季、年年都超额完成国家计划。他们的经验都受到了代表们的欢迎。
    建筑材料生产企业的代表也在会上交流了他们高产优质的经验。牡丹江水泥厂李锡华窑头小组，认真执行了“三大一快”（风大、火大、料大，快运转）的先进操作方法，创造了水泥窑台时产量的全国最高纪录。四川丹巴云母矿藏族青年斯大特突击队，由于创造了一系列的先进采矿方法，最近一次大爆破就炸了一万三千多立米，比普通爆破方法提高效率十倍以上。
    建筑工程部副部长刘裕民，在建筑系统先进经验交流会结束的当天讲了话。他说，这次会议对于建筑业中更广泛更深入地开展比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮落后的竞赛运动，实现继续不断跃进，具有重大意义。他希望各位代表继续发挥骨干作用、带头作用、桥梁作用，带动建筑职工创造出更加辉煌的成就。
