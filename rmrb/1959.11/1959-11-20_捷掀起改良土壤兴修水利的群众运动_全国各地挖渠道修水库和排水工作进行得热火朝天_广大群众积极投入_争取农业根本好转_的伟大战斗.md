Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 18th. Since the beginning of winter, a massive mass movement to improve soil and construct water conservancy projects has formed in Czechoslovakia. In all states across the country, canal digging, reservoir construction, and drainage work are in full swing, creating a scene of bustling activity everywhere.

The massive water conservancy project to transform 140,000 hectares of low-lying land in eastern Slovakia, which officially commenced in May this year, has entered its construction climax. This huge water conservancy project will be completed in 1965. At that time, Slovakia will produce an additional 20,000 carloads of wheat, 80,000 carloads of sugar beets, and 500 million kilograms of milk for the country each year, and will enable the area to achieve two crops a year.

Other regions are also carrying out massive soil improvement work. Since the beginning of autumn, the working people of the Olomouc region have begun their struggle to transform more than 40,000 hectares of low-lying land in the Morava River basin. The Pardubice region will complete the drainage project for 4,000 hectares of land by the end of this year. The Hradec Králové region has passed a fifteen-year long-term plan for soil improvement. According to this plan, by 1975, this region will complete the drainage project for 57,000 hectares of land and the irrigation project for 32,000 hectares of land. By then, this region will increase the country's output by more than 77,000 metric tons of grain and more than 500,000 metric tons of feed.

In addition to some large-scale water conservancy projects being constructed with state investment, many soil improvement projects throughout the country are being carried out by soil improvement cooperatives composed of several adjacent agricultural cooperatives, relying on their own manpower and financial resources. These soil improvement cooperatives have spread throughout all states in the country. Some small-scale water conservancy projects they have built have already played a significant role in preventing floods this summer and droughts this autumn. Currently, they are taking advantage of the slack farming season this winter and next spring to intensify various soil improvement tasks.

The mass movement to build farmland water conservancy projects has received strong support from the people across the country. Workers, staff, students, and residents in cities use their holidays to go to the countryside to participate in voluntary labor. Many factories have also allocated large numbers of transportation vehicles and machines to support the farmers. The youth have actively responded to the call of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Youth League, and actively plunged into this mass movement. In the Slovak region alone, voluntary labor teams composed of thousands of young people are participating in the construction of water conservancy projects at more than 400 construction sites. Many experts and technicians have also gone deep into the construction sites to help with this work.

Improving soil and building water conservancy projects have become one of the central links in Czechoslovakia's realization of the slogan "Strive for a Fundamental Improvement in Agriculture." Due to the full mobilization of the masses, this year's soil improvement work has achieved good results. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the country will overfulfill the soil improvement plan by 45%. By 1965, Czechoslovakia will complete the soil improvement work on 1.1 million hectares of land; while in the past fifty to seventy years, the benefited area of drainage and irrigation projects completed by Czechoslovakia was only 840,000 hectares.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 19th. Czechoslovakia's electricity generation this year will reach 22 billion kilowatt-hours, which is 3.5 times the pre-war level. In terms of national electrification, Czechoslovakia is now at the forefront of the world. At present, 96% of the country's rural areas have achieved electrification. It is expected that by the end of 1960, electricity will be supplied to every place in the country.

Currently, Czechoslovakia is building three huge thermal power plants. Two of them have a power generation capacity of 330,000 kilowatts each. The third thermal power plant is being built in the Karlovy Vary region, and the electricity it produces will be sufficient to supply a city with a population of 500,000.

The construction of hydropower stations is concentrated on the Váh River in Slovakia and the Vltava River in Bohemia. The three hydropower stations on the Váh River—Hričov, Mikšová, and Považská Bystrica—will be completed in 1962. At that time, they will supply approximately 410 million kilowatt-hours of electricity.

In the next few years, another eleven dams will be built on the 400-kilometer-long Dyje River, and it is expected that eighty-one reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 750 million cubic meters will also be built. The water stored in these reservoirs will be able to irrigate 36,000 hectares of agricultural land.

The Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) stipulates that the electric power industry will experience rapid development. It is expected that by 1965, Czechoslovakia's electricity generation will reach approximately 38 billion kilowatt-hours, which means that during this five-year plan period, electricity production will increase by 56%.

    捷掀起改良土壤兴修水利的群众运动
    全国各地挖渠道修水库和排水工作进行得热火朝天
    广大群众积极投入“争取农业根本好转”的伟大战斗
    新华社布拉格18日电　入冬以来，捷克斯洛伐克改良土壤、兴修水利的工作形成了一个声势浩大的群众性运动。在全国各州，挖渠道、修水库和排水工作正在进行得热火朝天，到处是一片沸腾的景象。
    改造斯洛伐克东部十四万公顷洼地的巨大水利工程，从今年5月正式动工以来，已进入修建高潮。这一巨大水利工程将在1965年完工，那时，斯洛伐克每年将为国家多生产二万车皮小麦、八万车皮甜菜和五亿公斤牛奶，并且将使这一地区的农作物实现一年两收。
    其他地区也在进行巨大的改良土壤的工作。阿罗木次州的劳动人民入秋以来就开始了改造摩拉瓦河流域的四万多公顷洼地的斗争。巴多比斯州将在今年年底完成四千公顷土地的排水工程。赫拉岱茨——克拉罗维州通过了一项改良土壤的十五年远景计划。根据这一计划，到1975年，这个州将完成五万七千公顷土地的排水工程和三万二千公顷土地的灌溉工程。到那时，这个州将为国家增产七万七千多公担的粮食和五十多万公担饲料。
    除了一部分大型水利工程由国家投资兴建外，全国各地的许多土壤改良工作都是由几个相邻的农业合作社组成的土壤改良合作社依靠自己的人力和财力来进行的。这种土壤改良合作社已经遍布全国各州，它们兴修的一些小型水利工程在今年夏季防涝和秋季防旱中已经发挥了很大作用。目前，它们正趁着今冬明春的农闲时节，加紧进行各项改良土壤的工作。
    大兴农田水利运动得到全国人民的有力支援。城市里的工人、职员、学生和居民利用假日到农村去参加义务劳动，许多工厂还拨出大批运输工具和机器去支援农民。青年们积极响应了捷克斯洛伐克共产党和青年联盟的号召，积极投入这一群众性的运动中去。仅仅在斯洛伐克地区，就有数千名青年组成的义务劳动队在四百多个工地上参加水利工程的建设。许多专家和技术人员也都深入工地，帮助这一工作的进行。
    改良土壤、兴修水利已经成为捷克斯洛伐克实现“争取农业根本好转”口号的中心环节之一。由于充分发动了群众，今年的土壤改良工作获得了良好的成绩。预计到今年年底，全国将超额完成土壤改良计划的45％。到1965年，捷克斯洛伐克将完成一百一十万公顷土地的土壤改良工作；而在过去五十年到七十年中，捷克斯洛伐克完成的排水灌溉工程的受益面积仅为八十四万公顷。
    新华社布拉格19日电　捷克斯洛伐克今年的发电量将达到二百二十亿度，即为战前的三点五倍。在国家电气化方面，捷克斯洛伐克现在已经居于世界前列。目前，全国已经有96％的农村实现了电气化。预计到1960年底，全国每个地方将有电力供应。
    现在，捷克斯洛伐克正在建筑三座巨大的热电站。其中有两座的发电能力各为三十三万瓩。第三座热电站建筑在卡罗维发利州，它生产的电力将足够供应拥有五十万人口的城市之用。
    水电站的建筑集中在斯洛伐克的发格河和波希米亚的弗尔塔瓦河上。发格河上的三个水电站——赫里索夫、米克索瓦和波瓦兹卡·比斯特里卡——将在1962年完成，到那时，它们将供应约四亿一千万度的电力。
    在今后几年内，在长达四百公里的塔瓦河上将建筑另外十一个水坝，预计还要建筑蓄水量总共为七亿五千万立方米的八十一个水库。这些水库的蓄水量将可以灌溉三万六千公顷的农业用地。
    第三个五年计划（1961—1965）规定，电力工业生产将有迅速的发展。预计到1965年，捷克斯洛伐克的发电量将达到约三百八十亿度，这意味着在这个五年计划期间，电力生产将增加56％。
