U.S. Imperialist Expansion in Africa
Wang Zhen

The scramble for Africa by Western powers was completed at the end of the nineteenth century. At that time, the United States was busy expanding into Latin America, the Pacific, and East Asia, and failed to acquire territory in Africa. After World War II, the United States took advantage of the decline of these old colonial powers to greatly strengthen its aggression in Africa, attempting to replace Britain and France's colonial positions in Africa. Its imperialist features are becoming increasingly exposed.

I

Capital export to obtain high profits is one of the U.S. imperialist acts of aggression in Africa. The main method adopted by the United States for capital export to Africa after the war was private investment. By 1957, U.S. private investment in Africa had a face value of $1 billion. If calculated according to actual value, it was more than $2 billion, accounting for about 4% of total U.S. overseas investment. This number is not large compared with British and French investment in Africa. But it is worth noting that the rate of growth of U.S. private investment in Africa is very rapid. From 1945 to 1955, U.S. overseas private direct investment more than doubled, while in the same period, U.S. private direct investment in Africa increased more than four times. Its scope of activities has also expanded from a few regions to various parts of Africa.

The degree of penetration of U.S. private capital in various regions of Africa is uneven. Generally, there are three situations: The first is the traditional U.S. investment areas, including the Union of South Africa and Liberia. The United States invested in these two regions as early as the end of the nineteenth century, and so far, U.S. capital in these two regions is still much more than in other regions of Africa. The second situation is the regions where U.S. capital penetration has been faster after the war, such as the Central African Federation, the Belgian Congo, and Egypt. Taking the Central African Federation as an example, before the war, U.S. private investment was very small, only about $26 million by 1950. It increased to $43 million in 1954, and doubled again by 1958, reaching about $83 million. The third situation is the regions where the United States currently has less investment. These regions are either riskier (such as the ongoing Algerian War) or are resisted by countries such as Britain and France, and the United States' capital strength is not strong. However, the United States has long coveted these regions and will still try every means to get in.

The focus of U.S. investment is on minerals, especially the exploitation of strategically valuable metals such as copper, uranium, and manganese. The United States seized upon Britain's economic difficulties after the war, forcing Britain to give up shares or mining rights in many mining companies that were originally its exclusive preserve. For example, the Union Minière du Haut Katanga, which monopolizes the uranium, copper and other mineral deposits in the Congo, was originally owned by Britain and Belgium. After the war, the United States forced Britain and Belgium to transfer one-third of the shares. In South Africa, although U.S. investment in gold, diamonds and other mining industries is only one-fifth of that of Britain, when the New York Chase Manhattan Bank of the Rockefeller Consortium established a branch in South Africa in 1958, it openly stated that it would catch up with British capital. In Ghana, U.S. capital is adopting a joint-stock approach with Ghana to develop aluminum and manganese mines, as well as to build the Volta River power station, which is needed to supply large amounts of electricity to aluminum smelting plants. U.S. capital is also active in British East Africa and Central Africa.

U.S. investment in the mineral resources of French African colonies is also gradually developing. On the one hand, the United States operates in Africa through subsidiaries of its own enterprises located in France, under the name of French companies; on the other hand, the U.S. government lends money to French companies to engage in the exploitation of various mineral resources. The conditions for U.S. loans are often that France is required to supply the United States with part or all of the products within a certain number of years to repay the principal and interest of the loan. At the same time, U.S. companies provide the necessary equipment in exchange for shares in French companies. For example, the Gabon manganese mine in French Equatorial Africa, with an annual output of one million tons, half of which is supplied to the United States, and U.S. Steel holds 49% of the shares in the manganese mining enterprise.

In addition to seizing metal mineral resources in Africa everywhere, oil exploration and exploitation is also the focus of U.S. investment in Africa. From Ethiopia and Somaliland on the east coast to Libya along the Mediterranean coast, as well as oil fields in Nigeria in West Africa and Cape Town in South Africa, U.S. companies are active.

Many important materials in Africa thus flow continuously to the United States. In 1957, U.S. imports of non-ferrous metals and diamonds from Africa accounted for 10.7% of the total U.S. imports of these two types of materials. In the same year, the total value of U.S. imports of mineral products from Africa reached $222.2 million, accounting for 39% of the total U.S. imports from Africa of $567.7 million that year. Most of the uranium ore imported by the United States comes from the Congo and the Union of South Africa. In 1956, almost all of the niobium and tantalum ore used in the United States was imported from Africa. These mineral products are important strategic materials.

The profits squeezed by U.S. big monopoly groups from direct investment in Africa every year are staggering. For example, the Mufulira Copper Mines company in Rhodesia, controlled by the United States, has a total issued capital of £15.86 million, but the profits for the 1955-1956 fiscal year alone were £18.17 million, with a profit rate as high as 125%. The Union Minière du Haut Katanga, which plunders the mineral resources of the Congo, made a profit of 28 billion Belgian francs in the six years from 1950 to 1955, with a profit rate of 100%. U.S. investment in South Africa had a face value of only $66.6 million in 1943, but by 1957, it had increased to $234 million, mainly relying on the reinvestment of profits.

II

On the one hand, U.S. imperialism carries out economic expansion to Africa through private direct investment, and on the other hand, under the banner of "U.S. aid," it actively penetrates into independent African countries.

This special way of state capital export not only paves the way for private investment, but also interferes in the internal affairs of recipient countries in the name of "helping" backward countries.

Most of the "U.S. aid" to African countries began during World War II when U.S. troops landed in North Africa. After the war, the scope of U.S. loans to various regions of Africa through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development became more extensive.

The direct economic "aid" from the U.S. government in Africa comes in four forms: the International Cooperation Administration's grants, the International Cooperation Administration's loans, the "surplus agricultural product aid" of Public Law 480 (i.e., the "Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act"), and the Export-Import Bank's loans. As of June 30, 1958, the total amount of the above-mentioned "aid" to African countries was $622.83 million, accounting for about 1.4% of the total amount of economic "aid" provided by the U.S. government to foreign countries through the above four channels. The absolute figure of U.S. economic "aid" to Africa is not large compared to other regions, but the rate of increase is very rapid. The U.S. government's allocation for economic "aid" to Africa in fiscal year 1958 increased seventeen times compared to fiscal year 1952.

The U.S. government's economic "aid" to Africa is mainly through the International Cooperation Administration, whose grants and allocations account for almost half of the total economic "aid" to Africa. This is followed by Export-Import Bank loans, accounting for 38.9%.

U.S. "aid" is mainly concentrated in two types of countries: one is countries that occupy important strategic positions, such as Morocco, Libya, and Egypt; the other is countries that produce important strategic raw materials, such as the Union of South Africa and Liberia.

U.S. economic "aid" to countries such as Morocco and Libya is mainly "aid" from the International Cooperation Administration. For example, of the approximately $107 million in "aid" given by the United States to Morocco by fiscal year 1958, half was "aid" from the International Cooperation Administration. More than half of the foreign economic aid handled by the International Cooperation Administration is usually so-called "defense support fees," which have a strong military aggression. In fiscal year 1958, nearly half of the "aid" given by the Administration to African countries was received by Libya and Morocco, where the United States has military bases.

In addition to the direct "aid" from the U.S. government, the United States also actively expands into other regions of Africa through the hands of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In this international financial institution, the United States accounts for 33.75% of the shares, and therefore is actually controlled by the United States.

From 1956 to February 1959, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development loans to African countries totaled more than $540 million, concentrated in regions rich in strategic raw materials such as South Africa, the Congo, and the Central African Federation. The total loans obtained by these regions accounted for 75.7% of the bank's total loans to Africa. By lending to these British and Belgian territories, the U.S. government has paved the way for U.S. monopoly consortia to plunder mineral resources and other resources in these regions.

The U.S. government uses the privileges obtained from "aid" to conduct resource surveys in Africa for monopoly capital. In 1953, Liberia first accepted the U.S. "Fourth Point Program aid." Shortly after the agreement was signed, the United States sent a large number of technicians to conduct an aerial photographic survey covering 87% of Liberian territory. As a result, various rich mineral deposits were discovered, providing clues for private investment in mining.

Another situation is that the U.S. government uses "U.S. aid" to build railways, highways, ports, and run hydroelectric power stations in Africa, opening up outlets for U.S. private enterprises' investment and product sales. A large part of "U.S. aid" is used in these areas. In 1955, the Export-Import Bank specially gave Liberia a highway construction loan of $15 million, mainly for the development of the rich forest timber resources in the west. The operation of the port of Monrovia in Liberia is undoubtedly for the export of rubber and iron sand. The U.S. loan for the development of the Volta River project in Ghana is to provide the large amount of electricity necessary for the development of Ghana's iron vanadium ore.

Taking advantage of the financial difficulties of recipient countries, under the guise of "aid," carrying out political aggression, intensifying control over the finances of recipient countries, and expanding U.S. privileges in Africa is another task of "U.S. aid." In 1949, the Union of South Africa experienced serious economic difficulties and requested a loan from the United States. The additional conditions put forward by the United States were "using gold as collateral" and "inspecting and supervising the internal affairs of South Africa." The United States used Libya's economic difficulties to extend the claws of "aid" in order to obtain control of the port of Tripoli and an important strategic base on the southern coast of the Mediterranean. U.S. technicians and "experts" who entered Libya with the establishment of the base formed a privileged class in Libya.

III

After the war, with the expansion of U.S. economic aggression in Africa, its military and political activities have also greatly strengthened. It has established a series of military bases in Africa, it directly interferes in the national independence movements in British, French, and Belgian colonies, it sends a steady stream of officials to Africa for investigation and visits, and it also invites many leaders of so-called "moderate" factions in the African labor movement to visit the United States. All these activities revolve around one goal: to create more favorable conditions for the penetration of U.S. monopoly capital, attempting to replace the colonial rule of Britain, France, and Belgium.

The African national independence movement, which takes the overthrow of imperialist plunder and colonial rule as its own task, has therefore become a thorn in the side of U.S. imperialism. Wherever it can be suppressed by force, the United States does not hesitate to use the hands of Britain, France, and Belgium to carry out crazy suppression of the national independence movement.

However, in places where the national independence movement is surging and the old colonial rule is in imminent danger, the United States plays a double-dealing trick: it superficially supports national independence, while secretly expanding U.S. influence and trying to squeeze out the ruling positions of Britain, France, and Belgium. In addition, with regard to the national independence movements in some regions, the United States on the one hand supports them in opposing old-brand colonialists, and on the other hand woos and buys over wavering elements in the national independence movement, making them lean towards the United States.

The African people, who have suffered from imperialist enslavement, will see through all the conspiracies and tricks of U.S. imperialism. The ambition of the United States to carry out economic expansion and military and political control, replacing the colonial rule of Britain, France, and Belgium, is no longer allowed by the times. The surging African national independence movement loudly answered these deceptive political tricks of U.S. imperialism.

    美帝国主义在非洲的扩张
    王珍
    非洲被西方列强瓜分完毕，是在十九世纪末叶。当时，美国正忙于向拉丁美洲、太平洋和东亚地区扩张，未能在非洲分得领地。二次大战以后，美国利用这些老牌殖民者的势衰力竭，大大加强了在非洲的侵略活动，企图取代英、法在非洲的殖民地位。其帝国主义的狰狞面貌，日益暴露无遗。
    一
    通过资本输出，取得高额利润，是美帝国主义在非洲的侵略活动之一。战后美国对非洲资本输出所采取的主要方式是私人投资。到1957年为止美国在非洲的私人投资，票面价值达十亿美元，如按实际价值计算约在二十亿美元以上，约占美国海外投资总额的4％。这个数字同英法在非洲的投资比较，为数不算大。但值得注意的是美国在非洲私人投资增长的速度很快。从1945年到1955年，美国海外私人直接投资增长一倍多，而同一时期，美国在非洲的私人直接投资却增加了四倍多。其活动范围，亦由少数地区普遍向非洲的各个地区伸展。
    美国私人资本在非洲各地区渗入的程度是不平衡的。大体上有三种情况：第一种是美国传统的投资地区，包括南非联邦和利比里亚。美国早在十九世纪末期就在这两个地区投资，至今这两个地区的美国资本仍比非洲其他地区多得多。第二种情况是战后美国资本渗入较快的地区，如中非联邦、比属刚果、埃及等地。以中非联邦来说，战前美国私人投资很少，战后到1950年仅约二千六百万美元。1954年就增加到四千三百万美元，到1958年又增加了一倍，约达八千三百万美元。第三种情况是美国目前投资较少的地区。这些地区或是由于风险较大（如阿尔及利亚战争未停），或是由于英法等国的抗拒，美国资本实力不算雄厚。但美国对这些地区也是垂涎已久的，今后它仍将千方百计地打进去。
    美国投资的重点是矿产，特别是铜、铀、铀、锰等有战略价值的金属的开采。美国抓住了英国战后经济上的困难，逼使英国出让原为其独占的许多矿业公司的股票或开采权。如垄断刚果的铀、铜等矿藏的卡坦加联合矿业公司，原为英国和比利时所有，战后美国逼使英、比转让出三分之一的股票。在南非，黄金、钻石和其他矿业的投资，美国至今虽只及英国的五分之一，但在1958年洛克菲勒财团的纽约大通曼哈顿银行在南非成立分行时，就公开表示要赶上英国的资本。在加纳，美国资本采取同加纳合股的方式开发铝、锰矿以及建立供给炼铝工厂所需大量电力的伏尔达河发电站。在英属东非和中非，也都有美国资本的活动。
    美国对法属非洲殖民地矿产的投资，亦在逐渐开展。美国一方面通过它自己设在法国的企业的子公司，以法国公司的名义在非洲活动；另一方面又由美国政府出面向法国公司贷款，从事开采各种矿产。美国贷款的条件，往往是要求法国将若干年内产品的一部或全部供应美国，以偿还贷款的本息。同时，由美国公司提供必要的装备，以换取法国公司的股份。如在法属赤道非洲的加蓬锰矿，年产达一百万吨，半数供给美国，美国钢铁公司在开采锰矿的企业中，占有49％的股票。
    除了到处攫取非洲的金属矿藏之外，石油的勘探和开采同样是美国在非洲投资的重点。从东海岸的埃塞俄比亚、索马里兰，到地中海沿岸的利比亚，以及西非的尼日利亚和南非的尖端开普敦等地的油田，都有美国公司的活动。
    非洲许多重要物资就这样源源不断地流向美国。1957年美国从非洲进口的有色金属和钻石占美国这两类物资进口总值的10.7％。同年，美国从非洲进口的矿产品总值达二亿二千二百万美元，占该年美国从非洲进口总值五亿六千七百七十万美元的39％。美国进口的铀矿砂大部分来自刚果和南非联邦。1956年美国所用的铌矿石和钽矿石几乎全部是由非洲进口的。这些矿产品都是重要的战略物资。
    美国大垄断集团对非洲的直接投资每年榨取的利润是十分惊人的。例如美国在罗得西亚控制的穆福利拉铜矿公司，发行资本总额为一千五百八十六万英镑，但光是1955—1956年度的利润就有一千八百十七万英镑，利润率高达125％。掠夺刚果矿产的卡坦加联合矿业公司，1950—1955年六年中的利润就有二百八十亿比利时法郎，利润率为100％。美国在南非的投资1943年票面价值只有六千六百六十万美元，到1957年为止，增加到二亿三千四百万美元，主要亦是靠利润的再投资。
    二
    美帝国主义一方面通过私人直接投资，向非洲进行经济扩张，另一方面打着“美援”的旗帜，积极向非洲独立国家渗入。
    “美援”这种特殊方式的国家资本输出，既为私人投资开辟道路，又能以“帮助”落后国家为名干涉受援国家的内政。
    美国给非洲各国的“援助”，大部分是在二次大战期间美国军队在北非登陆时开始的。战后，美国通过国际复兴开发银行向非洲各个地区的贷款，其范围更为广泛。
    在非洲出现的直接由美国政府出面的经济“援助”，有以下四种，即：国际合作署的赠与、国际合作署的贷款、480号公法（即“农产品贸易发展和援助法”）的剩余农产品“援助”和进出口银行的贷款。截至1958年6月30日为止，上述各项给非洲各国“援助”的总数是六亿二千二百八十三万美元，约占美国政府通过上述四个途径向外国提供经济“援助”总数的1.4％。美国对非洲经济“援助”的绝对数字比起其他地区并不算大，但增加的速度很快。1958年度美国政府对非洲经济“援助”拨款比1952年度增加十七倍。
    美国政府对非洲的经济“援助”主要通过国际合作署，该署的赠款和拨款几乎占对非洲经济“援助”总额的一半。其次是进出口银行贷款，占38.9％。
    美“援”主要集中于两类国家，一类是占有重要战略地位的国家，如摩洛哥、利比亚、埃及等国；一类是出产重要战略原料的国家，如南非联邦、利比里亚等国。
    美国对摩洛哥、利比亚等国的经济“援助”，主要是国际合作署的“援助”。如美国到1958年度为止给摩洛哥共约一亿零七百万美元的“援助”中，有一半是国际合作署的“援助”。国际合作署经办的对外经济援助，通常有半数以上是所谓“防御支持费”，带有很大的军事侵略性。1958财政年度，该署给非洲各国的“援助”中有将近一半为美国设有军事基地的利比亚、摩洛哥所得。
    除了美国政府直接的“援助”之外，美国还假国际复兴开发银行之手，积极向非洲其他地区扩张。这个国际金融机构中，美国股金占33.75％，因而实际上是美国控制的。
    从1956年到1959年2月，国际复兴开发银行对非洲各国的贷款共约五亿四千多万美元，集中在南非、刚果、中非联邦等盛产战略原料的地区。这几个地区所得贷款合计占该银行对非洲贷款总数的75.7％。美国政府通过对这些英、比属地的贷款，为美国垄断财团在这些地区进行矿产和其他资源的掠夺开辟了道路。
    美国政府利用“援助”取得的特权，为垄断资本在非洲进行资源调查。1953年，利比里亚首先接受美国的“第四点计划援助”，协定签字不久，美国就派出了大批技术人员，进行了一次包括利比里亚领土87％的航空摄影测量。结果发现了各种丰富的矿藏，提供了私人投资开采的线索。
    另一种情况是美国政府用“美援”在非洲修建铁路、公路、港口和开办水力发电站等，为美国私人企业的投资和产品销售打开出路。“美援”的很大部分是用在这些方面。1955年进出口银行专门给利比里亚一笔一千五百万美元的公路建设贷款，主要是为了开发西部丰富的森林木材资源。利比里亚的蒙罗维亚港口的经营，无疑是为了橡胶和铁砂的出口。美国在给加纳开发伏尔达河计划的贷款，是为了提供开发加纳铁钒土矿必需的大量电力。
    利用受援国家财政上的困难，假借“援助”为名，在政治上进行侵略，加紧控制受援国家的财政，扩张美国在非洲的特权，是“美援”的另一个任务。1949年南非联邦发生了严重的经济困难，要求美国贷款。美国提出的附加条件是“用黄金作抵押品”和“对南非内政进行视察和监督”。美国利用利比亚经济上的困难，伸出的“援助”魔爪，是为了取得的黎波里海港，以及地中海南岸重要战略基地的控制权。随着基地建立而进入利比亚的美国技术人员、“专家”，形成了利比亚的特权阶级。
    三
    战后，伴随着美国在非洲经济侵略的扩大，它的军事、政治活动也大为加强了。它在非洲建立了一系列的军事基地，它直接干预英、法、比等殖民地的民族独立运动，它络绎不绝地派遣大批官员到非洲考察、访问，它又邀请不少非洲工人运动中所谓“温和派”的领袖访问美国。所有这些活动都环绕着一个目的：为美国垄断资本的渗入创造更优越的条件，企图取代英、法、比的殖民统治地位。
    以推翻帝国主义掠夺和殖民主义统治为自己的任务的非洲民族独立运动，因此就成为美帝国主义的眼中钉。凡是可以用武力镇压的地方，美国就毫不犹豫地借英、法、比之手对民族独立运动进行疯狂镇压。
    但是，在民族独立运动高涨、旧的殖民统治危在旦夕的地方，美国则玩弄两面派手法：表面上支持民族独立，暗中则扩大美国的影响，并极力排挤英、法、比的统治地位。另外，对一些地区的民族独立运动，美国一方面支持他们反对老牌殖民主义者，另一方面则拉拢和收买民族独立运动中不坚定的分子，使他们倒向美国。
    饱受帝国主义奴役的非洲人民是会识破美帝国主义各种阴谋诡计的。美国这种进行经济扩张和军事政治控制，取代英、法、比殖民统治的野心，已不能为时代所容许。风起云涌的非洲民族独立运动，响亮地回答了美帝国主义这些骗人的政治把戏。
