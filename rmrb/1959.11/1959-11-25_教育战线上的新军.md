New Force on the Education Front
Jin Wen

In 1958, under the leadership of local Party organizations, a new force emerged on the education front: the new universities and specialized schools born in the Great Leap Forward. In the short period of just over a year, these schools overcame numerous difficulties in the initial stages of their establishment and, together with the original universities, advanced rapidly on the road to training talents for national construction. Such rapid and healthy development of higher education has opened a new page in the history of education in our country.

The tremendous achievement on the education front in our country is the inevitable result of the objective situation. In 1958, inspired by the Party's general line for building socialism, the Chinese people realized a Great Leap Forward in the national economy and achieved the communization of the entire countryside. Under this new situation, rapidly improving the cultural and technical level of our people and cultivating a large number of construction talents is not only the need of national economic development, but also the demand of the broad masses of the people. At the same time, as a result of the whole Party and all the people running schools, tens of thousands of people-run middle schools and agricultural middle schools across the country also need a large number of teachers. If these talents are only trained by the original universities, it will be far from meeting the needs. Under this situation, various localities implemented the central government's instruction on adopting a "walking on two legs" approach in school management, and while vigorously running primary and secondary schools, they also established universities, quickly bringing about a brand-new situation in higher education in our country.

Of course, these newly built schools may encounter some difficulties due to having fewer professors and poorer equipment. Any new thing, when it is in its nascent state, is always young and small. However, because it is a new thing, it has great vitality. Therefore, it is fully possible to quickly overcome these difficulties and forge ahead courageously. For example, new teachers have less experience, but they will gradually gain experience in teaching practice and become experienced teachers. The facts of the newly built universities in Tianjin are a good proof. These new teachers are enthusiastic, energetic, and humbly learn from old teachers. They make rapid progress and are respected and trusted by students. The equipment conditions are also the same. If they are not good today, they will gradually improve tomorrow. In fact, the Party and the country are always concerned about the development of education. Taking Tianjin Institute of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering as an example, after the school was built last year, through the hard work and frugality of all teachers, students and staff, the state also increased a lot of equipment to the school. Now this school with one thousand students has eighty-two new lathes in the machine shop of the practice factory alone, which can accommodate three hundred people to practice in the workshop at the same time. In the future, with the development of national construction, the teaching conditions of these newly built schools will undoubtedly be further improved.

Affirming that newly built universities have unlimited development prospects does not, of course, mean that there is nothing to improve in these schools at present, nor does it mean that one does not have to learn from the old universities at all. On the contrary, newly built universities, because they have just been established, still have some shortcomings and difficulties. However, as long as they are willing to learn and work hard, these shortcomings can be corrected and the difficulties can be overcome. Here, it should be particularly pointed out that we should pay attention to learning from old schools. Old schools are the backbone of higher education in our country and have rich experience. Newly built schools should humbly learn from these old schools and further improve their own level.

    教育战线上的新军
    津文
    1958年，在各地党组织的领导下，教育战线上突起了一支新军，这就是在大跃进中诞生的高等学校和专科学校。这些学校在短短的一年多的时间里，克服了建校初期的重重困难，和原有的高等学校一起，在为国家建设培养人才的大路上飞跃前进。高等教育事业如此迅速、如此健康的大发展，为我国教育史揭开了新的一页。
    我国教育战线上这样巨大的成就，是客观形势必然出现的局面。1958年，我国人民在党的建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，实现了国民经济的大跃进，并在全国农村实现了人民公社化。在这种新的形势下，迅速提高我国人民的文化、技术水平，培养大批的建设人才，不仅是国民经济发展的需要，也是广大人民群众的要求。同时，由于全党全民办学的结果，全国数以万计的民办中学、农业中学，也需要大量的师资。这些人才，如果仅仅靠原有的高等学校培养，远远不能满足需要。在这种形势下，各地贯彻执行了中央关于在办学工作中也要采用两条腿走路的指示，在大办中小学的同时，也举办了高等学校，很快就使我国高等教育事业出现了一个崭新的局面。
    当然，这些新建学校由于教授少，设备差，可能会碰到一些困难。任何新事物，当她处于萌芽状态时，总是幼小的。但是，因为她是新事物，有着巨大的生命力。因而有充分可能迅速克服这些困难，奋勇前进。例如：新教师经验少，但他会在教学实践中逐步取得经验，变为有经验的教师。天津市新建高等院校的事实就是很好的证明。这些新教师热情高，干劲足，虚心向老教师学习，进步很快，得到学生的尊敬和信任。设备条件也同样如此，今天不好，明天就会逐步好起来。事实上，党和国家时时刻刻都在关心着教育事业的发展。以天津机电学院为例：去年建校以后，经过全校师生员工勤俭办学，国家也给学校增加了许多设备，现在这个有一千名学生的学校，仅实习工厂的机工车间就有八十二台新式车床，可供三百人同时进车间实习。今后，随着国家建设的发展，这些新建学校的教学条件无疑地会更加改善。
    肯定新建高等院校有着无限的发展前途，当然不是说目前这些学校就没有什么可改进的地方了，更丝毫不意味着可以不向老的高等学校学习了。恰恰相反，新建高等学校，由于刚刚创办，目前仍然存在一些缺点和困难，但是，只要肯学习，肯努力，这些缺点是可以纠正的，困难是可以克服的。这里，应当特别提出的是，要注意向老学校学习。老学校是我国高等学校的骨干，有着丰富的经验，新建学校应当虚心地向这些老学校学习，进一步提高自己的水平。
