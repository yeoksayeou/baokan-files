    The Captain is back!
    Was the Heroes' Conference lively?
    How much "wisdom" did you bring back?
    How many "treasures" did you bring back?
    Tell us quickly, stop just smiling!
    The words you spoke on behalf of the team,
    I heard them at the pithead long ago;
    Little Sanzi puffed out his chest,
    Old Wang Brother gripped his pneumatic drill,
    Feeling a surge of hot energy rising.
    That day, going down the mine,
    The whole mine was striving for high yields;
    Our team created a new record again,
    After work, I didn't even shower,
    Just went to send you a telegram.
    Captain, you're back!
    Quickly share your advanced experience;
    Our coal production,
    Although leaping again and again,
    Everyone still thinks it's too little!
    The Party Central Committee's instructions,
    We will definitely achieve them;
    Chairman Mao's囑咐 (zhǔfù: exhortations),
    We will definitely remember them.
    In the charge, our miners will sound the horn first!
    The water guns have been adjusted,
    The drill bits have been sharpened,
    Lead us, Captain!
    This group of young men of ours,
    Which one's enthusiasm isn't ringing loud and clear!

    队长回来了
    江苏贾汪煤矿工人　孙友田
    队长，回来了！
    群英会上可热闹？
    取来多少“经”？
    捎来多少“宝”？
    快说呀，别老笑！
    您代表小队讲的话，
    俺在井口早听到；
    小三子挺着胸脯，
    老王哥握着风镐，
    只觉着，一股热劲往上冒。
    那一天，下矿井，
    全矿都在闹高产；
    咱队又创新纪录，
    下了班我没洗澡，
    就去给您打电报。
    队长，回来了！
    快把先进经验介绍；
    咱们的煤产量，
    虽然一跃再跃，
    可大伙还是都嫌少！
    党中央的指示，
    咱们一定做到；
    毛主席的嘱咐，
    咱们一定记牢。
    打冲锋，咱们矿工先吹号！
    水枪已经调正，
    钻头已经磨好，
    你领头吧，队长！
    咱们这群小伙子，
    哪一个干劲不是当当叫！
