A Children's Paradise
    — A Record of the Changjiang Electric Factory Relying on the Masses to Run a Nursery Through Diligence and Thrift

In 1958, the Party Central Committee put forward the general line for building socialism, and the people of the whole country threw themselves into the great leap forward of production with great enthusiasm. At this time, the 1,112 family members of the workers and staff of the Chongqing Changjiang Electric Factory also took up their jobs and participated in socialist construction. However, with the emergence of this situation, a more serious problem of child care arose, and expanding the nursery became an urgent matter.

There were 6,538 children under the age of seven in the factory area. In addition to the 1,735 children cared for by their grandparents, and the 610 children already in nurseries, there were still more than 4,000 children in need of care. The factory Party committee attached great importance to and cared about this issue. The Party committee secretary made a mobilization report at the factory-wide workers' and staff meeting, pointing out the importance of expanding nurseries in the factory area and explaining the great relationship between running nurseries well and promoting production.

The Whole Factory Runs Nurseries

The next day, the worker comrades actively responded to the call of the Party committee, and applications to vacate rooms and requests to work as nursery staff poured in from workshops and departments like snowflakes. Zhang Shuxiang, a Communist Youth League member and recorder in the Tool Section, wrote three applications in a row before being approved by the organization. Workers from all over the factory sent cradles, desks, and benches. Day and night, gongs and drums resounded, and the living welfare management department of the Changjiang Electric Factory was very lively. Within three days, more than 3,000 square meters of houses were vacated, and within seven days, more than 2,000 pieces of utensils and toys were received. Even twenty retired old workers sent quilts, pillows, and towels. They said, "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao today can our children and grandchildren receive such care and attention, and the little masters of the country can enter nurseries and live happy lives. Although we are old and retired now, we still want to contribute to the nursery so that we can feel comfortable in our hearts." In terms of manpower, the Party committee, based on the work situation, approved 67 workers to work in the nursery, including recorders, workers, Party members, and League members. For the sake of cultivating the next generation of the motherland, they happily embarked on new jobs. In this way, by vigorously relying on the masses and making do with whatever was available, the nursery was developed, achieving nurseries in every village and stations in every section, accommodating a total of 2,318 children and eliminating the burden of 1,112 housewives participating in production labor.

Due to the rapid development of nursery organizations, their large number, wide distribution, and scattered work, management was very inconvenient. Therefore, based on the specific situation, they adopted the method of integrating modern and indigenous methods, combining large and small, and using the old to lead the new, merging some of the village and section nursery groups into village and section nursery stations, and merging some of the village and section nursery stations into local branches, so that the nursery organizations gradually became more standardized. Now, under the leadership of the nursery general office, there are four branches and four lactation rooms. In terms of personnel, appropriate adjustments were also made, assigning some of the staff from the old nurseries to the newly established branches to lead the new comrades, while the new comrades from the workshops and families mostly stayed in the old nurseries to learn from the original staff. When adjusting desks, benches, and beds, the communist style of large-scale collaboration was greatly promoted. Although utensils and toys were temporarily insufficient, the nursery staff took time out of their spare time to make and supplement them, and the master craftsmen in the workshops also provided support from time to time. Especially in terms of toys, they made more than 2,000 pieces themselves this year. Here is a simple toy factory. In the toy factory, people once heard them recite such a rhyme:

Clever girls, girls so clever, so many toys they've made,
Some fly in the sky, some run on the ground,
Some spin around, some quack and sound;
We dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do,
Making the children laugh with glee!

Putting Politics in Command

After the village and section nursery groups and nursery stations were merged in the first quarter of this year, the Party's leadership was strengthened and the political and ideological education of the nursery staff was strengthened, and the work of the nursery took on a new look. For example, during the encephalitis epidemic in April this year, they took timely emergency measures, putting forward the fighting slogan of "Resolutely defeating encephalitis, not letting a single person be infected, and not withdrawing from the front line until encephalitis is eliminated." The nursery staff insisted on doing preventive disinfection work such as nasal drops and medication, for six consecutive weeks, and successfully passed this hurdle without suffering from encephalitis infection.

Because the new nursery staff were not familiar with the business and could not grasp the age characteristics of the children, and some of the workers' family members were illiterate before coming to the nursery, they encountered many difficulties in their work. For example, there were bottles of milk on the table, but they did not know who to feed, and they were even more afraid to give medicine to the children. These became obstacles in daily work. To this end, they promptly launched literacy studies and short-term teaching and training classes, taking one month of part-time training in rotation, which solved these problems.

Health care is one of the main businesses of the nursery. Staff did not understand disease prevention and health knowledge and simple medical treatment, which not only affected children's health, but also affected parents' production. After more than a month of study and internships in hospitals, some of the staff are now able to perform injections independently.

In order to promote the work, pacesetters were established among the nursery staff, setting off a wave of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced, and carrying out a variety of competitions such as "Five Goods," "Four Satisfactions," "Red Flag Bearer," "Clever Girl," and "Super Mom," and summarizing and promoting advanced experience in a timely manner. For example, after promoting Wang Suqin's experience in nursing children under the age of three and Zhang Shihui's experience in keeping clothes in order, the work took on a new look.

Serving the Workers, Serving Production

The nursery tried its best to serve the workers and serve production, putting forward: "Open the door wide during the day, don't close the door at night, and follow the workshop wherever it fights." In the first quarter of this year, this factory built a new factory building and needed some female workers to go to the site to do auxiliary work. After they learned about this, they immediately took the lead, organized manpower to set up a lactation room at the construction site, cleaned the room thoroughly and arranged it neatly in one day.

In order to improve the quality of children's food and promote children's health, they also engaged in sideline production on a large scale. The cooks planted about fifteen mu of land, raised twenty-four pigs, and more than thirty chickens, and often made various kinds of snacks for the children to eat. They said, "As long as the children eat and grow fat, we will find ways to do it."

In order to reduce the burden on parents and not delay production, the nursery aunts and teachers learned to cut hair in three days. Now they cut the children's hair every half month without charging fees. The children happily tell their parents when they go home: "The teacher cut my hair for me!"

During festivals or holidays, they specially set up service stations for the workers, voluntarily taking care of the children for the workers, so that the workers can better participate in recreational activities, and therefore they are deeply praised by parents and the masses.

    儿童的乐园
    ——记长江电工厂依靠群众勤俭办托儿所
    1958年党中央提出了建设社会主义的总路线，全国人民都轰轰烈烈地投入了生产大跃进浪潮。这时，重庆长江电工厂一千一百一十二名职工家属也走上了工作岗位，参加了社会主义建设。但是随着这个情况的出现，带来了一个比较严重的儿童寄托问题，扩建托儿所成为一件刻不容缓的事情了。
    厂区内共有七岁以下儿童六千五百三十八名，除去一千七百三十五名是有祖父母或外祖父母看管，和原有在托儿童六百一十名以外，还有四千多孩子需要入托。厂党委非常重视和关怀这个问题，党委书记在全厂职工大会上作了动员报告，指出在厂区扩建托儿所的重要性，说明了办好托儿所对促进生产的重大关系。
    全厂办所
    第二天，职工同志们积极响应了党委的号召，自动让房和要求到托儿所作保育员的申请书像雪片般地在各车间、各科室飞舞着。工具科记录员共青团员张蜀祥，连续写了三次申请书才被组织批准了。全厂职工有的送摇床，有的送桌凳，一天到晚，锣鼓喧天，长江电工厂生活福利管理部门显得热闹非常。三天之内，共让出三千多平方米的房子，七天之内就收到用具、玩具二千多件，甚至连退休的二十个老工人也送来棉被、枕头和毛巾。他们说：“只有在今天共产党、毛主席的领导下，我们的子孙才会受到这样的关怀和重视，国家的小主人才能进到托儿所过幸福日子。现在我们虽然年老退休，我们还是要为托儿所尽点力量，心里才感到舒服。”在人力方面，党委根据工作情况，批准了六十七名职工到托儿所工作，其中有记录员，也有工人，有党员，也有团员，她们为了培养祖国的下一代，愉快地奔上了新的工作岗位。就这样大力依靠群众，因陋就简地把托儿所发展起来了，做到了村村有所，段段有站，共收容儿童二千三百一十八名，消除了一千一百一十二名家庭妇女参加生产劳动的拖累。
    由于托儿组织的迅速发展，数量多，面又广，工作分散，管理起来很不方便。于是他们根据具体情况，采取以洋带土，以大带小，以老带新的方法，把部分娃娃组合并到村段托儿站，又把有的村段托儿站合并到当地分所里，使各托儿组织逐步正规起来。现在，在托儿所总所领导下，共有四个分所，四个哺乳室。在人员方面，也作了适当调配，把原有老所的部分人员，安排到新建立的分所去带动新同志，从车间、家属中来的新同志，多数留在老所跟原有人员学习。在调整桌凳床铺的时候，大大发扬了共产主义大协作的风格。用具玩具虽然一时还不敷应用，但所内保教人员随时抽出业余时间制造添补，车间老师傅也不时支援。特别是玩具，今年之内她们自己就制造了二千多件。这里有一个简单的玩具厂，在玩具厂里，人们曾听到她们念了这样一首歌谣：
    巧姑娘，姑娘巧，玩具做得真不少，
    有的天上飞，有的地下跑，
    有的团团转，有的嘎嘎叫；
    我们敢想敢说又敢做，
    让孩子们玩得哈哈笑！
    政治挂帅
    今年第一季度，各村段的托儿组、托儿站合并起来以后，加强了党的领导、加强了对保育人员的政治思想教育，托儿所的工作出现了新的面貌。如今年4月份脑炎流行时，她们就及时采取紧急措施，提出“坚决战胜脑炎，不让一人受到传染，不消灭脑炎不下火线”的战斗口号，保教人员坚持作滴鼻服药等预防消毒工作，连续六个星期，结果胜利地渡过了这一关，没有遭受到脑炎的传染。
    新的保育人员因为业务不熟悉，对儿童年龄特点不能掌握，有些职工家属来所以前是文盲，在工作中遇到不少困难。如桌上摆着一瓶瓶的牛奶，不知喂谁，更不敢给儿童服药。这些成了日常工作中的障碍。为此，她们及时开展了扫盲学习和短期教养训练班，半脱产地轮训一个月，才解决了这些问题。
    保健工作是托儿所主要业务之一，工作人员不懂得预防疾病卫生知识及处理简易治疗，不仅影响儿童健康，也影响家长生产。通过一个多月的学习和到医院实习以后，现在一部分人员已经能够独立进行注射了。
    为了推动工作，在保育人员中树立了标兵，掀起了学先进、赶先进的热潮，开展了“五好”“四满意”、“红旗手”、“巧姑娘”、“赛妈妈”、等多种多样的竞赛，及时总结推广了先进经验。如推广王素琴对护理三岁以下小孩的经验和张世惠衣服不错乱的经验以后，工作就出现了新的面貌。
    为职工服务　为生产服务
    托儿所千方百计为职工服务，为生产服务，提出：“白天大开门，夜晚不关门，车间战斗到哪里，我们就跟到哪里”。今年第一季度，这个厂修建新厂房需要一部分女工去到上面搞辅助工作。她们知道后，就立即打先锋，组织人力到工地设立了哺乳室，一天时间就把屋子打扫得干干净净，布置得整整齐齐。
    为了提高儿童伙食质量，促进儿童身体健康，他们还大搞副业生产。炊事人员种了约十五亩地，养了二十四只猪，三十几只鸡，还经常作各种样式的点心给儿童吃。他们说：“只要娃娃吃了长得胖，我们都要想法作到。”
    为了减少家长负担，不耽误生产，托儿所的阿姨老师们在三天中学会了理发。现在每半个月给儿童理一次，不收费用，儿童回家欢喜地给爸爸妈妈说：“是老师给我剪的发呢！”
    每逢节日或休假，她们特为职工设立了服务站，义务给职工照看孩子，让职工们能更好地参加文娱生活，因此深得家长和群众的好评。
