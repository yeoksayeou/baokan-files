Chinese Botanists and Zoologists Actively Conduct Surveys, Research, and Compilation

China boasts a vast array of plant and animal species and abundant biological resources. Since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the pace and achievements in both biological survey work and specimen collection and data accumulation have greatly surpassed those of any previous year. In terms of biological survey work, Chinese botanists have discovered approximately 1,500 species of wild, useful plants across the country. Regarding specimen collection, the number of plant and insect specimens obtained in 1958 alone exceeded the total collected in the thirty years before liberation. In the systematic organization and compilation of survey research data, zoologists and botanists have primarily focused on species most closely related to economic construction, systematically organizing and compiling various economic animal monographs, economic plant monographs, and lists. In addition, zoologists and botanists have achieved considerable success in regional and specialized animal and plant monographs or survey reports.

Compiling a national flora is a challenging task. After the start of the Great Leap Forward, Chinese plant taxonomists proposed completing the compilation of the "Flora of China," a massive eighty-volume work of approximately twenty million words originally planned to take decades, within eight to ten years. Currently, the first volume of the second volume of the "Flora of China," covering ferns, has been published, and several other volumes are scheduled to be printed or published before the end of this year. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has also recently established the Editorial Committee of the Flora of China.

Science Press Publishes Selected Readings of Ancient Chinese Geographical Classics

The first collection of "Selected Readings of Ancient Chinese Geographical Classics," edited by Professor Hou Renzhi, has recently been published by Science Press. This collection includes selections from "Yu Gong," "Hanshu Geography," "Shui Jing Zhu," and "Xu Xiake's Travels." "Yu Gong" is a geographical work from China's transition period from slave society to feudal society. The author had already mastered regional research methods at that time and provided concise descriptions of the geographical conditions of each region. "Hanshu Geography" is a national geographical work that appeared after the establishment of a centralized feudal empire in China. It uses administrative divisions as the framework to describe the national territory, administrative regions, population, products, establishment evolution, mountains, rivers, and local customs, pioneering an easy-to-imitate writing style for geographical books. "Shui Jing Zhu" is a unique geographical work that takes the national waterways as the framework and describes the geographical conditions of various places in detail. "Xu Xiake's Travels" reflects the author's surpassing of his predecessors in systematically observing and describing natural geography in a new direction. In the past, Chinese geographical books emphasized territory, evolution, customs, and products, while Xu Xiake began to systematically observe and describe nature. In particular, his investigation of the karst landforms in the vast southwestern region illustrates that the author not only faithfully described nature but also began to explore its laws. From this perspective, this travelogue can be regarded as a valuable document of the world's earliest karst landform research.

"Selected Readings of Ancient Chinese Geographical Classics" is intended for geographical workers interested in the development of ancient Chinese geography for reference and reading. The book not only includes more detailed textual annotations but also uses maps to supplement the shortcomings of textual descriptions.

"Selected Readings of Ancient Chinese Geographical Classics" will continue to select and edit ancient Chinese geographical classics for publication in separate volumes in the future.

    我国动植物学家积极开展调查、研究和编纂等工作
    我国动植物种类繁多，生物资源极为丰富。从1958年大跃进以来，不论是在生物普查工作方面，或是标本采集、资料积累方面，其速度和成就更大大超过以往任何一年。在生物普查工作方面，我国植物学工作者在全国各地发现了各种野生有用植物一千五百种左右。在标本采集方面，1958年一年中所得到的植物标本和昆虫标本，都超过了解放以前三十年内所采集的标本的总和。在调查研究资料的系统整理和编纂方面，动植物学工作者首先注意了与经济建设关系最密切的种类，系统地整理和编写了各种经济动物志、经济植物志和各种名录。此外，关于地方性的和专科专类的动植物志或调查报告，动植物学家也获得了不少成绩。
    编写全国性的植物志是一件艰巨的工作。大跃进开始以后，中国的植物分类学家提出要把原定在几十年内完成的约有二千万字的八十卷巨著——中国植物志的编纂工作提前在八至十年内完成。现在，中国植物志的第二卷蕨类植物第一册已经出版了，还有几卷也将在今年年底前付印或出版。中国科学院最近还成立了中国植物志编辑委员会。
    科学出版社出版中国古代地理名著选读
    侯仁之教授主编的“中国古代地理名著选读”第一辑，最近已经由科学出版社出版。本辑的内容是选自
  “禹贡”、“汉书地理志”、“水经注”和“徐霞客游记”。“禹贡”是我国从奴隶社会向封建社会过渡时期的一部地理著作，作者在那时已经掌握区域研究的方法，并对每区地理情况作了简洁扼要的描述。“汉书地理志”是在我国中央集权的封建大帝国建立之后才出现的一部全国性的地理著作，它以行政区划为纲来叙述全国疆域、政区、人口、物产、建置沿革、山川和地方风俗等，首创了一种便于仿效的地理书籍的写作体例。“水经注”是独创一格的地理著作，以全国水道为纲，详细地记述了全国各地的地理情况。“徐霞客游记”反映了作者在系统地观察和描述自然地理方面超越了前人的一种新方向。过去我国地理书籍偏重于疆域、沿革、风土和物产等方面，而徐霞客则开始了有系统地观察自然、描述自然。特别是他对于西南广大地区内石灰岩地貌的考察，说明了作者不但忠实地描述自然，而且已经走向规律性的探讨。从这一点来说，这部游记可以看作是全世界最早的石灰岩地貌研究的宝贵文献。
    “中国古代地理名著选读”是供给对中国古代地理学的发展有兴趣的地理工作者参考阅读的。书中不仅加了比较详细的文字注释，而且还利用地图以补文字说明的不足。
    “中国古代地理名著选读”今后将继续选择我国古代地理名著分册编辑出版。
