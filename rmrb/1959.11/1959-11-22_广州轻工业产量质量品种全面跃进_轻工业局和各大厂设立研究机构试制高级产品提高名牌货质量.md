    Guangzhou, November 21 (From Our Newspaper) – Guangzhou’s light industrial products are continuously leaping forward in terms of output, variety, quality, labor productivity, and cost.
    Daily necessities, which were once in short supply in the first half of the year, have now been fully restored, and the output of ninety-nine kinds of small commodities has exceeded last year’s level, with forty kinds, including toothpaste, lampshades, and combs, more than doubling. Among the products included in the city's plan, the output growth rate is also around 50%. Among the twenty-seven major products in the textile industry, twenty products, including cotton cloth, cotton yarn, and printed silk, have also increased to varying degrees compared with the same period last year. At the same time, product quality is also continuously improving. For example, among the fifteen major light industrial products, ten products, including enamelware, paper, batteries, and rubber shoes, have seen their qualification rates rise month by month. The qualification rate of paper has increased from 73% in June to over 90% now. The increase in labor productivity is also very significant. For example, the light industry sector has increased by 9.59% compared with the same period last year. The textile industry increased by 14.66% in the third quarter compared with the second quarter. In addition, product costs have generally decreased.
    Guangzhou’s leading departments are also vigorously taking measures to seize the production of high-end products, famous brands, and a wide variety of products. Now, the Municipal Light Industry Bureau has established research institutes according to major industries such as glass, food, and hardware. Major factories have also set up research offices to trial-produce high-end products and improve the quality of famous brands. Existing high-end products and famous brands are being prioritized to ensure the supply of raw materials for their production. Currently, eighty products, including Hongmian brand high-end soaps, with one hundred and ten specifications, have been included in the plan.
    The rapid development of Guangzhou's light industry production is the result of the conscientious implementation of the Party's "walking on two legs" policy. Since the beginning of this year, a secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee has been in charge of light industry, and the Municipal Party Committee has frequently studied and discussed the light industry production situation. After discovering a decline in the production of some small commodities at the beginning of this year, it immediately studied measures. From April, it increased the proportion of light industrial products included in the national plan from 37% to 72%, making the vast majority of light industrial products in the city part of the city's planned products, thereby powerfully guaranteeing the production of these products. Under the great encouragement of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, light industry production has achieved even greater development. The supply of major raw materials needed for light industry, such as wood for papermaking, hardened oil for soap, and rubber and wire rod, has increased compared with the past. Therefore, the output of products such as soap, rubber shoes, cigarettes, and rivets in the third quarter increased by half to double compared with the previous quarter. The raw materials needed for the textile industry are also more abundant than in the past.

    广州轻工业产量质量品种全面跃进
    轻工业局和各大厂设立研究机构试制高级产品提高名牌货质量
    本报广州21日电　广州市轻工业产品产量、花色品种、质量、劳动生产率和成本等各项指标都在不断跃进。
    上半年曾一度缺少的日用品，现在已经全部恢复了，并且有九十九种小商品产量超过去年，其中增产一倍以上的有牙膏、灯罩、梳子等四十种。在市计划产品中，产量增长幅度也都在50％左右。在纺织行业的二十七个主要产品中，也有棉布、棉纱、印染丝绸等二十个产品比去年同期有不同程度的增长。同时，产品质量也在不断提高，如在十五个主要轻工业品中，就有搪瓷、纸张、电池、胶鞋等十个产品的正品率是逐月上升的，如纸张正品率已从6月份的73％提高到现在的90％以上。劳动生产率的提高也很显著。如轻工行业就比去年同期提高了9.59％。纺织行业在第三季度比第二季度提高了14.66％。此外，产品成本也普遍降低了。
    广州市领导部门还大力采取措施，抓紧高级产品、名牌货和花色品种的生产。现在，市轻工业局已经按玻璃、食品、五金等各大行业，分别成立研究所，各大工厂也设研究室来进行高级产品的试制和改进名牌货的质量等工作。并且将现有高级产品和名牌货加以排队，以确保生产这些产品的原料材料的供应。目前已有红棉高级香皂等八十个产品的一百一十种规格列入计划。
    广州轻工业生产的飞速发展，是认真执行党的“两条腿走路”方针的结果。今年以来，中共广州市委就有一位书记长管轻工业，市委并经常研究讨论轻工业生产情况。在今年初发现部分小商品有减产现象后，立即研究措施，从4月份起，就把轻工业中纳入国家计划的37％的产品增加到72％，使全市绝大部分轻工业产品列为市计划产品，从而有力地保证了这些产品的生产。在党的八届八中全会的巨大鼓舞下，轻工业生产有了更大的发展。轻工业所需的主要原料材料如造纸的木材、肥皂的硬化油以及橡胶、盘元等，供应量都比过去增加了，因此，肥皂、胶鞋、香烟、元钉等产品第三季度的产量比上季增长半倍至一倍以上。纺织行业所需的原料材料也比过去充足。
