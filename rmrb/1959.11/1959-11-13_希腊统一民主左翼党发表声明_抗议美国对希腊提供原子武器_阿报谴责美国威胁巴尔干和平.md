Xinhua News Agency, Athens, November 8th: According to TASS, the Greek Defense Staff Headquarters announced that the first batch of American "Honest John" rockets has arrived in Greece, in accordance with the Greek-US agreement. In the near future, the first army unit equipped with these rockets will be established. The statement particularly emphasizes that this batch of rockets is capable of carrying atomic warheads. This means that Greece is beginning the first stage of establishing rocket bases on its territory.

However, the Greek government issued a formal statement on the 7th, rejecting the proposal to convene a Balkan nations conference to discuss resolving outstanding issues and establishing a rocket-free zone in the Balkans.

Xinhua News Agency, Athens, November 11th: According to TASS, the Executive Committee of the Greek United Democratic Left Party published a statement in "Dawn Daily," protesting the US provision of atomic weapons to Greece.

The statement said that this is absolutely not for defense, but to push the country onto a dangerous road of subordinating national interests to the "strategic needs of the US and the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization bloc."

The statement pointed out that choosing this moment to place atomic weapons in Greece is a provocation to the cause of peace and can only serve the interests of the Cold War.

The statement emphasized that the Greek people reject the Greek government's decision, demanding that the government not take measures that would exacerbate the situation, but rather take peaceful actions and respond to the friendly proposals made by the Soviet Union and neighboring Balkan countries. The statement said that the United Democratic Left Party will submit the issue of placing atomic weapons in Greece for parliamentary discussion.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 12th: The Albanian "People's Voice" published a commentary on the 12th, stating that the arrival of the first batch of American rockets in Greece has aroused unease and anger among peace-loving people in the Balkans.

The newspaper commented on the Greek government's formal rejection of the proposal to convene a meeting of Balkan heads of government and the arrival of American rockets in Greece. The commentary pointed out that these actions are completely contrary to the interests of the Greek people. They attempt to obstruct disarmament and create a serious threat to peace in the Balkan region. The commentary said that the arrival of American rockets in Greece is a deliberate attempt to maintain international tension and the "Cold War" in the Balkans. The Albanian people express their anger and condemnation of this behavior by the Greek ruling clique. The Albanian people will vigilantly watch the aggressive conspiracies and plans of the imperialist bloc and its supporters.

    据新华社9日讯　据塔斯社雅典8日讯：据希腊国防参谋总部宣布：根据希美协定，第一批美国“诚实的约翰式”火箭已经运抵希腊。最近期间将建立第一支用这些火箭装备的军队。声明特别着重指出，这批火箭能够携带原子弹头。这意味着：希腊开始了在本国领土上建立火箭基地的第一阶段。

    声明说，这绝对不是为了国防，而是把国家推到使民族利益服从于“美国和侵略性的北大西洋公约组织集团战略需要”的危险道路上去。
    声明指出，选择时机来在希腊置放原子武器是对和平事业的挑衅，只能为冷战的利益服务。
    声明强调指出，希腊人民拒绝希腊政府的决定，要求政府不要采取会使局势加剧的措施，而要采取和平行动，并且回答苏联以及与希腊毗邻的巴尔干国家提出的友好建议。声明说，统一民主左翼党将把关于在希腊置放原子武器的问题提交议会讨论。
