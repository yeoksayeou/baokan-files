Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd: The Hungarian Olympic men's and women's fencing teams and the Chinese men's and women's fencing teams held a wonderful exhibition match today. The clanging of swords filled the Beijing Gymnasium, and the audience applauded the exciting scenes from time to time.

Today's exhibition featured individual matches in men's foil, epee, sabre, and women's foil. The Hungarian male and female fencers once again demonstrated their excellent swordsmanship to the Beijing audience. They are technically proficient, have rich competition experience, and their movements are subtle, quick, and accurate. Their attack routes are varied, and they can strike opponents from various angles, including above, below, left, and right. Although most of the young Chinese athletes have only been involved in this sport for one or two years, they have already shown good performance. They are brave and enterprising, have flexible footwork, and react quickly. They often use sudden advances and retreats to attack opponents. After these several matches with the Hungarian athletes, their basic skills, strategies, and tactics have greatly improved.

Today, in the men's foil competition, 1957 world champion Fülöp engaged in a tense match with 1958 world runner-up Gyuricza. Fülöp is good at attacking, while Gyuricza is good at counterattacking in defense. In the end, Fülöp won by scoring five touches to two.

This year's Chinese men's foil champion, Liu Lingji, had a very heated match with Gyuricza. At the start, Liu Lingji attempted to parry the opponent's blade and attack, but the opponent took advantage of the situation, turned his wrist to avoid the blade, and thrust straight, and Liu Lingji was hit first. In the second round, Liu Lingji became familiar with the opponent's movements, made a feint attack, followed by a shift, and hit the opponent. In the third round, Liu Lingji used the same method to hit the opponent again. Later, he counterattacked and hit the opponent's upper right chest when the opponent had not completed the attacking movement. Liu Lingji finally won by scoring five touches to two first. The match between 23-year-old Liu Lingji and Fülöp was also very intense. In the ninth round, after both sides had scored four touches each, Liu Lingji lost the final victory due to insufficient experience.

China's men's foil runner-up, 19-year-old Wen Guogang, performed very well today. He played nine rounds against Fülöp and was only defeated by four touches to five.

The Hungarian Olympic men's and women's fencing team is the first foreign fencing team to visit China. They have held a total of four exhibition matches with Chinese athletes in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan and other places. During the performances and joint practices, they selflessly shared their valuable experience with the Chinese athletes. Today was their last exhibition match in China.

    中匈击剑队举行精彩表演赛
    新华社22日讯　匈牙利奥林匹克男、女击剑队同中国男、女击剑队今天举行了一场精彩的表演赛。北京体育馆内剑声铮铮，观众不时为动人心魄的场面鼓掌叫好。
    今天表演的是男子轻剑、重剑、花式剑和女子轻剑的个人比赛。匈牙利的男、女击剑运动员再一次向北京的观众显示了他们卓越的剑术。他们技术全面、比赛经验丰富，动作细小迅速而准确，进攻路线变化多端，能从上、下、左、右各种角度刺击对方。年轻的中国运动员大部分虽然从事这项运动只有一、二年历史，可是已经有很好的表现。他们勇猛进取，步法灵活，反应迅速，常常以急进急退的办法袭击对方，经过这几次同匈牙利选手的比赛，他们在基本技术、战略和战术的运用上都有了很大提高。
    今天，在男子轻剑比赛中，1957年世界冠军富洛普同1958年世界亚军兹维科夫斯基展开了紧张的比赛，富洛普善于攻，兹维科夫斯基擅长在防守中反击。结果富洛普以五比二先刺中对方五剑取得胜利。
    今年中国男子轻剑冠军刘凌基同兹维科夫斯基的比赛十分热烈。一上来，刘凌基企图拨开对方剑锋进攻，但对方乘势，一转腕子躲过剑头，直刺过来，刘凌基反被击中一剑。第二回合刘凌基摸熟了对方来路，虚刺一剑接着一个转移击中对方。第三回合刘凌基按照老办法又刺中对方一剑。后来又在对方未完成进攻动作时反攻击中对方胸部右上角。刘凌基最后以五比二先刺中对方五剑获胜。二十三岁的刘凌基和富洛普的比赛也十分激烈。在双方已经互中四剑后的第九回合中，刘凌基由于经验不足被对方刺中而失去最后胜利。
    中国男子轻剑亚军、十九岁的文国刚今天表演得很出色。在同富洛普比赛时赛了九个回合才以四比五被对方击中五剑失败。
    匈牙利奥林匹克男、女击剑队是到中国访问的第一个外国击剑队。他们前后在北京、上海、武汉等地同中国队员一共举行了四场表演赛，在表演和共同练习中他们无私地把宝贵的经验告诉中国队员。今天是他们在中国的最后一次表演赛。
