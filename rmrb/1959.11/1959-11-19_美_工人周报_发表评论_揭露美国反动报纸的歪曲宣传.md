Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 18th: The American "Worker's Weekly" published a commentary on the 15th, exposing the distorted propaganda by American newspapers regarding the letter that Premier Zhou Enlai wrote to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on November 7th.

The "Worker's Weekly" pointed out that the reactionary newspapers deliberately downplayed a very important point in Premier Zhou Enlai's letter, which is the emphasis that any conflict between China and India, no matter how small, would be exploited by those who are hostile to the friendship between China and India, to achieve their ulterior motives.

The "Worker's Weekly" pointed out that on the day Premier Zhou Enlai's letter was announced, those with hostile intentions immediately voiced their clamor. The "Worker's Weekly" said that the "New York Times" ridiculed the suggestions put forward by China, its tone as agitated as if it were discussing America's own border issues.

The "Worker's Weekly" concluded by pointing out that Premier Zhou Enlai's letter represents the wishes of the people of China and India, and that the governments of the two countries must satisfy this desire of the people.

    美“工人周报”发表评论
    揭露美国反动报纸的歪曲宣传
    新华社18日讯　纽约消息：美国“工人周报”15日发表评论，揭露美国报纸就周恩来总理11月7日写给印度总理尼赫鲁的信件所进行的歪曲宣传。
    “工人周报”指出，反动报纸都故意贬低周恩来总理信件中的一个非常重要的问题，这就是信件中所强调指出的，中印两国之间的任何冲突，那怕是很小的冲突，都会被那些敌视中印两国友谊的人所利用，以达其不可告人的目的。
    “工人周报”指出，在周恩来总理的信宣布的那一天，那些心怀敌意的人就马上发出了他们的叫嚣。“工人周报”说，“纽约时报”嘲笑中国提出的建议，其语气的激动，就像在讨论美国自己的边界问题似的。
    “工人周报”最后指出，周恩来总理的信件表示了中印两国人民的愿望，并且表示了两国政府必须满足人民的这种愿望。
