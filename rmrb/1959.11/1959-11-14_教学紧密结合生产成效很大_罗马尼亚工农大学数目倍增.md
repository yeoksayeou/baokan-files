Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, November 12th: In the 1959-1960 academic year, the number of worker universities and rural people's universities in Romania increased from 94 in the previous academic year to 297, and the number of students approximately tripled.

    Currently, there are 228 worker universities in larger industrial and mining enterprises, with more than 20,000 students studying in them. Rural people's universities are newly established, with a total of 69.

    The teaching in these schools is closely integrated with production. Worker universities generally have a study period of eight months per term, and in addition to studying social sciences and cultural knowledge, students also study industrial technology. For example, worker universities in the oil region offer courses in oil extraction, geology, physics, and chemistry.

    The curriculum of rural people's universities includes socialist transformation of agriculture, agricultural economics, agronomy, animal husbandry, and horticulture. At the end of each term, students are tested, and those who pass are issued certificates. University professors, middle school teachers, engineers, and others serve as teachers in the people's universities on a voluntary basis.

    教学紧密结合生产成效很大
    罗马尼亚工农大学数目倍增
    新华社布加勒斯特12日电　在1959—1960学年中，罗马尼亚的工人大学和农村人民大学由上一学年的九十四所增加到二百九十七所，学生人数大约增加了两倍。
    现在，在较大的工矿企业中，共有工人大学二百二十八所，在其中学习的有两万多人。农村人民大学是新开办的，共有六十九所。
    这些学校的教学与生产紧密结合。工人大学每期学习时间一般是八个月，学员们除了学习社会科学和文化知识之外，还学习工业技术。例如，在石油区的工人大学中就讲授石油开采、地质、物理、化学等课程。
    农村人民大学的课程包括农业社会主义改造、农业经济、农艺学、牲畜饲养、园艺学等。每期结业时，要对学生进行测验，成绩及格的发给证明书。人民大学的教师是由大学教授、中学教员、工程师等义务担任的。
