    Report from our newspaper: Yunnan Summarizes Advanced Experiences, Formulates Plan to Eliminate Forest Fires
    Fight Hard Through Winter and Spring, Eradicate the Root of Mountain Fires
    This newspaper reports "Rely on the power of the communes, build an impregnable wall, fight hard through winter and spring, and eradicate the root of mountain fires." This is the battle cry put forward by the Yunnan Provincial Forestry Department at the provincial forest fire prevention on-site meeting held in Luquan County.
    Since the realization of people's communes in rural areas, Yunnan Province has made great achievements in forest fire prevention. Five counties, including Luquan, Xichou, Honghe, Qiaojia, and Lijiang, have emerged as counties that are basically free of forest fires, and forest fires in other counties have also been greatly reduced. The number of forest fires in the first half of the year decreased by 15.2% compared with the same period last year. The burnt area decreased by 54.3%. This has played a significant role in ensuring the timber needed for national construction and in the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery in the people's communes. The meeting fully affirmed this achievement, analyzed the favorable conditions for continuing to carry out forest fire prevention, and formulated a plan to strive to basically eliminate forest fires this winter and next spring.
    In order to basically eliminate forest fires throughout Yunnan Province, the meeting exchanged advanced experiences from counties such as Luquan and Xichou. These experiences mainly include: First, forest fire prevention work must be closely coordinated with the five industries of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. The six management areas of Pingshan People's Commune in Luquan County have completely changed the backward production methods of burning ash for fertilizer, burning buckwheat stalks, and destroying forests for land reclamation, and have not had a forest fire for three years. As a result, dry dams have become water dams, and barren mountains have become green mountains. Xinshan Management Area of Tuanjie Commune has adopted the method of herders兼forest rangers. They have not only changed their past habits of making fire, smoking, and cooking on the mountains, but also actively publicized to the masses, becoming vanguards in forest fire prevention. Second, mobilize and organize employees of factories and mines in forest areas to participate in forest fire prevention. In addition to establishing forest fire prevention agreements, factories and mines in mountainous areas of Jianchuan County also contracted the protection of forests within their respective areas. Employees of Yimen Mining Area inserted 1,360 fire prevention signs in the mountains, which also yielded good results. Third, coordinate with relevant departments to organize inspections in a timely manner, implement reward and punishment measures, and promote forest fire prevention work. Luquan County has organized three mass forest fire prevention inspections this year, commending and rewarding advanced forestry units and advanced forest fire prevention workers, which has encouraged the broad masses to participate in forest fire prevention. At the same time, resolute blows were given to the enemy's sabotage. Fourth, strengthen and improve the organization and system of forest fire prevention. Longtan Management Area of Jinyuan Commune in Xundian County, which has not had a forest fire for nine years, has adopted the method of joint prevention between villages and teams, and divided the mountains into areas for closing mountains for afforestation, grazing areas, firewood cutting areas, and reclamation areas, which are managed separately, eliminating forest fires.
    Through the exchange of experiences, the meeting further boosted morale, established the lofty ambition of eliminating forest fires, and launched a competition to learn from, compare with, and catch up with advanced units without forest fires. Areas that have basically eliminated forest fires have expressed their intention to further eliminate fires completely and maintain the status of being free of forest fires forever. Areas that have not eliminated fires are also striving to eliminate forest fires this winter and next spring.

    云南总结先进经验订出杜绝山林火灾计划
    苦战一冬春　铲除山火根
    本报讯　“依靠公社力量，筑起铜墙铁壁，苦战一冬春，铲除山火根。”这是云南省林业厅在禄劝县召开的全省护林防火现场会上提出的战斗口号。
    自从农村实现人民公社化以来，云南省护林防火工作取得了巨大的成就。全省已经出现禄劝、西畴、红河、巧家、?江等五个基本无山林火灾县，其他县的山林火灾也大大下降。全省上半年山林火灾次数比去年同期下降了15.2％。火烧面积下降了54.3％。这对保证国家建设所需要的木材，对人民公社全面发展农、林、牧、副、渔都起到很大的作用。会议充分肯定了这一成绩，并且分析了继续开展护林防火的有利条件，订出了力争今冬明春基本杜绝山林火灾的计划。
    为了在云南全省范围内基本杜绝山林火灾，会上交流了禄劝、西畴等县的先进经验。这些经验主要是：一、护林防火工作必须和农、林、牧、副、渔五业生产紧密配合。禄劝县屏山人民公社六块管理区彻底改变了历来烧灰积肥、烧荞把、毁林开荒的落后生产方法，三年没有发生过山林火灾，结果干坝变水坝，荒山变绿山。团街公社新山管理区采取放牧员兼护林员的办法，他们不但改变了过去上山烤火、吸烟、煮饭等习惯，而且积极向群众宣传，成了护林防火的尖兵。二、动员组织林区厂矿企业职工参加护林防火。剑川县山区各厂矿除订立了护林防火公约外，还包干所属范围山林的防护工作。易门矿区职工在山林里插上防火牌一千三百六十块，也收到很好的效果。三、配合有关部门，及时组织检查，贯彻奖惩办法，推动护林防火工作。禄劝县今年先后组织了三次群众性的护林防火大检查，表扬奖励了林业先进单位和先进护林工作者，鼓舞了广大群众参加护林防火的积极性。同时，对敌人的破坏坚决给予打击。四、加强和健全护林防火的组织和制度。寻甸县九年无山林火灾的金源公社龙潭管理区，采取村与村联防、队与队联防的办法，并把山林划分为封山育林区、放牧区、砍柴区、开荒区，分别加以管理，杜绝了山林火灾。
    会议通过交流经验，进一步鼓足干劲，树立了消灭山林火灾的雄心大志，开展了学先进、比先进、赶先进的无森林火灾竞赛。基本杜绝山林火灾的地区，表示要进一步彻底消灭火灾，永远保持无山林火灾。未杜绝火灾的地区，也争取在今冬明春消灭山林火灾。
