    The Mystery of Fire-Resistant Cloth
    Yang Min

    There are many records of "fire-resistant cloth" in ancient Chinese books. "Liezi" writes: "Fire-resistant cloth, when washed, must be thrown into the fire...when taken out of the fire and shaken, it is as white as snow." Legend has it that Liang Ji, a Grand General of the Later Han Dynasty, had a garment made of "fire-resistant cloth," and even demonstrated its strange properties in public at a banquet.

    The real existence of fire-resistant cloth seems to be beyond doubt. However, what exactly was it made of? There are many theories. Some ancient books say it was made from the fur of fire rats from the Western Regions, while others say it was made from the bark of a tree on certain islands in the South Sea... In short, most people believed it was a foreign product. However, the "History of Yuan" believes it was made of asbestos. Asbestos is produced in many parts of China, especially Sichuan Province, where the reserves and quality are very good. It can be seen that fire-resistant cloth must have been made by the ancient working people of China with their own local materials and was not some exotic fairy product.

    Recently, while reading "Miscellaneous Poems of Yandu," I came across a poem that said: "The root of talc is like wood, it will not turn to ash after burning; it is said that fire-resistant cloth is made of this 'night light' material." The note at the end of the poem mentions that "talc" is the name of a tree, also called "unburnt wood" or "night light wood," which is produced in the Western Hills of Beijing. Its roots are like hemp fibers, and in addition to being used to make fire-resistant cloth, it is also widely used to mix into lime to fill the inner walls of stoves. This further proves that fire-resistant cloth was produced in China itself. The book "Annals of Yanjing" also says: "Residents of the capital usually add coal fire on the first day of the tenth month and remove the fire on the first day of the second month. The stove is made of unburnt wood, which is whiter than alum and is light, warm, strong and durable." The above two books are works from the late Qing Dynasty, and the records should be relatively reliable. "Unburnt wood" can be used to make stoves, presumably it has some special properties, or it can really weave cloth-like substitutes, which is not impossible. But I wonder if this kind of tree still exists in the Western Hills or elsewhere now?

    火浣布之谜
    杨旻
    我国很多古籍中都有关于“火浣布”的记载。“列子”上写道：“火浣之布，浣之必投于火……出火而振之，皓然疑乎雪。”相传后汉大将军梁冀就有一件用“火浣布”制成的衣服，并且在一次宴会上还当众表演过它的奇异性能。
    火浣布的真实存在，看来是没有问题的。不过，它究竟是用什么东西做成的呢？说法就很多了，古书上有的说是西域地方火鼠的毛所制，有的又说是南海某些岛上一种树木的皮所制……总之，大多都认它是外国的产品。但“元史”却认为它是用石绵制成。石绵在我国很多地方都有出产，尤其是四川省，蕴藏量和品质都很好。可见，火浣布一定是我国古代的劳动人民用自己的道地材料所制并不是什么异方仙品。
    最近偶读“燕都杂咏”，其中有一首诗云：“滑石根如木，焚烧终不灰；相传火浣布，即此夜光材。”诗末的注释中提到：“滑石”是一种树的名称，又叫“不灰木”或“夜光木”，为北京西山所产，根如麻缕，除用于制火浣布以外，还普遍地用它混合到石灰中，填敷火炉的内壁。这就更可以证明火浣布是我国自己所产。又“燕京岁时记”一书也说：“京师居人例于十月初一日添设煤火，二月初一日撤火，火炉系不灰木为之，白于矾石，轻暖坚固。”上引二书都是清朝后期的作品，所载当较可靠。“不灰木”既可用于造火炉，想必是具有某种特殊的性能，或者真正能织造布之类的代用品，也未可料。但不知西山或他处现在还有这种树木否？
