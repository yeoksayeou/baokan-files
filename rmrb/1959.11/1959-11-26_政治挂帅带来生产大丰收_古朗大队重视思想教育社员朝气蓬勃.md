    Politics Takes Command, Bringing a Bumper Harvest
    Gulang Brigade Emphasizes Ideological Education, Members are Energetic

    (Our Dispatch) The Party organization of the Gulang Brigade in Gu Tan Commune, Fan Shun County, Guangdong Province, due to its adherence to putting politics in command, has made the brigade members energetic and, in both the Great Leap Forward of last year and the continuing leap forward this year, has ranked among the best in the county in terms of production.

    The Gulang Brigade is in an economic crop area of Fan Shun County, with fish ponds and sugarcane occupying the vast majority of the cultivated land. The brigade originally had a weak work foundation, but during the Great Leap Forward last year, its work underwent a transformation, and various productions were greatly improved. Last year, the total value of agricultural and sideline production reached more than 2,092,000 yuan, an increase of more than 37% compared with 1957. The unit area yield of various crops has also increased significantly, with sugarcane increasing from an average yield of 7,500 jin per mu in 1957 to 14,500 jin per mu. This year, various productions have developed even more, and large-scale bumper harvests are a certainty.

    The key to the Gulang Brigade's achieving such great achievements lies in the fact that the brigade's Party organization can conduct meticulous ideological education work in accordance with the spirit of the General Line. For example, in July of this year, the higher-level Party committee called for expanding the planting of rice by utilizing vacant land such as the edges of fish ponds. At that time, many people believed that they had no experience in planting rice and did not understand the cultivation techniques, and that planting rice on the edges of ponds and rivers would not yield a harvest. After discovering these ideological situations, the Party General Branch unified everyone's thinking and understanding through airing views and debate. During the debate, the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants expressed their enthusiastic support. They pointed out that in the years of the leap forward, as long as there is enough drive, one can learn what they don't know. And grain is the most precious of treasures, and the Party's call to plant more rice is not wrong. Most of the members also supported the Party's call and expressed their intention to make a great leap forward in cultivation. After unifying their thinking and understanding, the Communist Party members of the brigade immediately led the masses to take action. In more than twenty days, they expanded the planting of rice by more than 1,600 mu, exceeding the task. For example, between this summer and autumn, the brigade was hit by a major flood. At that time, some people thought that there was no hope for the crops and that "even the gods could not save" them. In response to this situation, the Party General Branch, on the one hand, put forward various favorable conditions and criticized the above-mentioned pessimistic and disappointed emotions; on the other hand, it organized manpower to vigorously rescue the crops. After making achievements in one place, they then held on-the-spot meetings to promote it comprehensively. After more than ten days of intensive labor, more than 1,600 mu of submerged sugarcane were all rescued and obtained large-scale bumper harvests.

    Strengthening the education of Party members and constantly helping Party members overcome shortcomings and improve their work style is an important part of the Gulang Brigade Party General Branch's ideological and political work. Chen Zijiao, the branch secretary of the Nanlang Squadron, took the lead in working hard and skillfully in the spring of this year in deeply plowing sugarcane fields, improving the soil, and spring plowing, and achieved many results. However, he later became complacent because of this and relaxed field management, causing some sugarcane to suffer from drought. After discovering this situation, the Party General Branch gave him strict criticism. Chen Zijiao also overcame his complacency in a timely manner and led the members to catch up quickly, which rapidly changed the production appearance of the squadron.

    The Gulang Brigade has a total of four squadrons. The brigade holds a monthly evaluation of the production situation of each squadron, and if good experiences are discovered, it also holds on-the-spot meetings in a timely manner to promote them. Through evaluation and on-the-spot meetings, production was checked, experiences were exchanged, and ideological education was conducted for cadres and members.

    政治挂帅带来生产大丰收
    古朗大队重视思想教育社员朝气蓬勃
    本报讯　广东省番顺县古坛公社古朗大队的党组织，由于坚持了政治挂帅，使这个大队的社员朝气勃勃，在去年大跃进和今年继续跃进中，生产上都列入全县的前茅。
    古朗大队是番顺县经济作物地区，鱼塘、甘蔗占耕地总面积绝大部分。这个大队原来工作基础较差，在去年大跃进中，工作有了转变，各项生产得到很大的提高。去年农副业总产值达二百零九万二千多元，比1957年增长了37％强。各种作物单位面积产量亦有较大的提高，甘蔗由1957年平均亩产七千五百斤，提高到一万四千五百斤。今年的各项生产都有更大的发展，大面积丰产已成定局。
    古朗大队所以取得这样巨大成就，关键在于这个大队的党组织，能够根据总路线的精神，进行细致的思想教育工作。例如今年7月间，上级党委号召利用鱼塘边等空地扩种水稻。当时有不少人认为种水稻没有经验，不懂得耕作技术，在塘边河边种水稻不会有收成。党总支发现这些思想情况后，就通过鸣放辩论，来统一大家的思想认识。辩论中，广大贫农和下中农表示热烈拥护。他们指出，在跃进年头，只要干劲足，不懂的也能学会。而粮食是宝中之宝，党号召多种水稻没有错。大多数社员也都拥护党的号召，表示要在耕作上来一个大跃进，思想认识统一后，这个大队的共产党员就立即带领群众行动起来。他们在二十多天中，扩种了一千六百多亩水稻，超额完成了任务。又如今年夏秋间，这个大队遭到特大洪水侵袭，当时有些人认为庄稼没有希望了，“神仙也难救”了。针对这一情况，党总支一方面提出各种有利条件，批判上述悲观失望情绪；一方面组织人力大力抢救。他们在一处地方做出成绩后，就接着召开现场会议，全面推广。经过十多天的紧张劳动，一千六百多亩受浸的甘蔗，全部被抢救过来，并获得大面积丰产。
    加强对党员的教育，不断帮助党员克服缺点、改进作风，是古朗大队党总支进行政治思想工作的重要一环。南朗中队分支部书记陈自教，在今春深翻甘蔗地、改良土壤和春耕中，积极带头苦干巧干，取得了不少成绩。但以后他却因此自满起来，放松了田间管理，使一部分甘蔗受旱。党总支发现这一情况后，就对他进行了严格的批评。陈自教也及时克服了自满情绪，带领社员急起直追，使中队的生产面貌迅速有了改变。
    古朗大队共有四个中队。大队对每个中队的生产情况，每月都举行一次评比，发现好的经验，还及时召开现场会议推广。通过评比和现场会议，既检查了生产，交流了经验，又向干部和社员进行了思想教育。
