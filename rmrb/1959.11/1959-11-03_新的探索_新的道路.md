	New Exploration, New Paths
	Ma Shizeng, President of Guangdong Cantonese Opera Institute

	I am a Cantonese opera actor. In the old society, we actors were regarded as lowly people, relegated to the lowest of the low, and despised by others. I acted for more than forty years and suffered deeply from the oppression and humiliation of the ruling class in the old society. The corrupt officials, cruel bureaucrats, despots, hoodlums, and ruffians of the old society often persecuted and devastated us by any means, even worse than bandits. If they were slightly dissatisfied, they would throw us in jail and ban our performances. Just as Dou E said in "The Injustice to Dou E": "The officials have no intention of administering justice, leaving the people unable to speak out." Since the Chinese Communist Party came into being and liberated all of China, we Cantonese opera actors have been able to stand up.

	Under the Party's meticulous care and love, we have everything. We have fixed salaries, public medical care, homes for the elderly, kindergartens, nurseries, and drama schools. Our lives have undergone tremendous changes. We are no longer bullied and humiliated, and we are valued by society. In the old society, over ninety percent of us Cantonese opera performers were illiterate and lacked knowledge. Now, thanks to the Party's education, young and old alike have become literate, able to read newspapers, write, and even publish articles in newspapers, understanding world events. Many Cantonese opera actors have joined the Chinese Communist Party and the Communist Youth League and have been elected as people's representatives and members of the CPPCC at all levels. I am a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC and a representative of the people of Guangdong Province. We are now living a happy life where the elderly are cared for, the young are nurtured, the young are educated, and the strong are employed. I am fifty-nine years old this year and have been acting all my life. Looking back on the past and remembering the present, my excited and joyful feelings are truly indescribable!

	Our Cantonese opera, in the old society, suffered from the destruction of the bourgeoisie and feudal classes and was influenced by colonial ideology, taking a dangerous path of commercialization. At that time, yellow, terrifying, and all kinds of ugly things were brought onto the stage, while true art was ignored. After liberation, the Party led us in carrying out Cantonese opera reform work. Over the years, through reforms in various aspects, Cantonese opera art has been rescued, allowing it to turn back from the brink of death and embark on a thriving path. This is a major event that all Cantonese opera actors are praising! Over the past ten years, under the guidance of the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" and "walking on two legs," we have reorganized, adapted, and created many excellent traditional plays, excavated and reorganized many traditional performance arts, clarified stage images, and compiled and performed some excellent modern plays. Such as "Sou Shu Yuen," "Guan Hanqing," "The Feast of Five Lords," "Burning Incense," "Three Mothers Teach Son," "Zhao Yun Urges Return," "Li Wenmao Uprising," "Three Marshals Trapped in Xiaoshan," "A Flower," "Liang Tianlai," "The Chain Scheme," "Peony Pavilion," "Ma Fulong Selling Arrows," "Tale of Worshipping the Moon," "Liu Hulan," "Red Flower Ridge," "Hongxia," "Noble Profession," "Lin Chong," "Liu Yi Delivers the Book," etc., are all relatively excellent Cantonese opera plays. The great achievements of Cantonese opera work should first and foremost be attributed to the leadership of the Party!

	Although I have been acting for many years, in the old society, I did not act seriously. At that time, we simply did not understand things like creative methods, nor were we willing to rehearse or study the creation of characters. Performances were simply "meeting on stage," improvising at will when the time came. Sometimes we pretended to know what we did not know, putting on airs to intimidate people, ashamed to learn from others, and wanting to "maintain" our "artistic dignity." There is a saying in our acting profession: "Everyone has an artistic knife in their hand, you kill me, I kill you!" Meaning that colleagues are like enemy states, fighting and vying with each other, always taking pleasure in defeating others! How can we make progress in artistic work like this? This is a completely bourgeois artistic ideology! Since liberation, through continuous learning, I have gradually realized the error of this ideology, and under the education of the Party, I have begun to seek new creative methods and explore new paths. In recent years, thanks to the Party's patient guidance and the help of my comrades, my artistic outlook has undergone great changes. First of all, I have realized the principle of art serving socialism, and I have paid attention to the combination of ideological content and artistry. I insist on having a director rehearse the play, and each play must go through repeated research and rehearsal. Each character must go through careful analysis and research and meticulous design of actions.

	When rehearsing "Guan Hanqing," I further explored the creative principle of combining revolutionary realism with revolutionary romanticism. First of all, the spirit of combining revolutionary realism with revolutionary romanticism embodied in Tian Han's drama script "Guan Hanqing" deeply moved me. After reading the script, I was inspired by Tian Han's great revolutionary romanticism spirit. Guan Hanqing's extraordinary temperament and noble style educated me. So, I decided to adapt Tian Han's script. When adapting and performing "Guan Hanqing," it was the time of the national Great Leap Forward, and the leaping spirit of the masses encouraged me. The Party and my comrades gave me great encouragement and help, which greatly liberated my thinking and enlightened me a lot. I felt that first of all, the spirit of revolutionary romanticism should be fully embodied in the script adaptation and performance of "Guan Hanqing," and the great temperament of Guan Hanqing should be expressed to the fullest. Therefore, I studied Guan Hanqing's works. I designed Guan Hanqing as a warrior in the dark society who loves the masses very much, has a very strong sense of justice, and is unconventional and unrestrained. I and Comrade Hong Xiannv and others designed the performance of the "Butterfly Double Flying" scene. I hope to create a climax through this scene, fully embody the spirit of revolutionary romanticism, passionately praise Guan Hanqing and Zhu Lianxiu, and express their great and beautiful ideals, making this scene even more stylish. At the same time, according to our understanding, we changed the ending of the play into a tragic ending, and carefully designed the actions of the characters in other scenes, striving to make this play profound and moving, and striving to highlight Guan Hanqing and Zhu Lianxiu's indomitable fighting spirit and their noble quality of "heroic spirit lasting forever." Our adapted and performed "Guan Hanqing" was warmly welcomed by the masses. This should naturally be attributed to Tian Han's original work first; at the same time, it should also be said that the success of "Guan Hanqing" is because we followed the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, which is why we were so successful. Of course, the performance of "Guan Hanqing," especially the character of Guan Hanqing that I played, is still not good enough, and there are still many shortcomings that need to be constantly corrected and further processed and enriched.

	The method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism that I explored when creating the character of Guan Hanqing is a new exploration in my artistic life, the beginning of a new path, which I will never forget! I now understand that only with full revolutionary enthusiasm and a serious and responsible attitude, deeply researching and analyzing the script and characters, deeply excavating the characters' thoughts and feelings, and trying every means to express the characters' spiritual appearance, can the characters truly live on the stage. I adapted and performed "Qu Yuan" some time ago, but the performance effect was not very ideal. At that time, I did not find the reason. After the performance of "Guan Hanqing," when I thought back, I felt that the reason why "Qu Yuan" was not ideal was that the spirit of revolutionary romanticism was insufficient in the handling of this play, lacking full revolutionary enthusiasm, lacking ideals, not liberating the mind, and not fully expressing Qu Yuan's patriotic poet temperament with surging passion, but only treating him as a loyal and patriotic minister. I am prepared to strive to explore the creative method of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, and revise "Qu Yuan" to make it a better play.

    新的探索　新的道路
    广东粤剧院院长　马师曾
    我是一个粤剧演员。在旧社会里，我们演戏的人，被视为贱民，归入下九流，为人所不齿。我演了四十多年的戏，深受旧社会统治阶级的压迫和侮辱。旧社会的贪官酷吏、恶霸、地痞、流氓，时常对我们无所不用其极地迫害和摧残，甚于强盗。稍一不遂，就拿我们去坐牢，禁止我们的演出。正如“窦娥冤”里窦娥所说的：“官吏们无心正法，使百姓有口难言”，自从有了中国共产党，解放了全中国，我们粤剧演员才得翻了身。
    在党的无微不至的关怀与爱护之下，我们什么都有了。我们有固定的工薪，有公费医疗，有敬老院、幼儿园、托儿所、戏剧学校，我们的生活有了极大的变化。我们不再受欺凌侮辱，我们受到了社会的重视。在旧社会里，我们粤剧艺人百分之九十几是文盲，知识非常贫乏，如今有了党的教育，老的少的都有了文化，能读报、能写作，甚至有些人能在报纸上发表文章，懂得了世界大事。许多粤剧演员，参加了中国共产党和共青团，被选为各级人民代表、政协委员。我就是政协全国委员会委员和广东省人民代表。我们现在过的是老有所归、幼有所养、少有所学、壮有所行的幸福生活。我今年五十九岁了，演了一辈子的戏，抚今忆昔，我的激动欣喜的心情，实在是难以形容的！
    我们粤剧，在旧社会里，曾受资产阶级封建阶级的摧残，受到殖民地思想的影响，走过商业化的危险道路。那时候，黄色的、恐怖的、一切丑恶不堪的东西都搬上了舞台，真正的艺术反而无人过问。解放后，党领导我们进行了粤剧改革工作。历年来在各方面的改革中，挽救了粤剧艺术，使粤剧艺术从死亡的边缘回过头来，走上欣欣向荣的道路。这是我们粤剧界全体演员所齐声乐道的一件大事！十年来，粤剧在党的“百花齐放、推陈出新”和“两条腿走路”的方针的指导下，整理、改编、创作了不少优秀的传统剧目，挖掘、整理了不少传统表演艺术，澄清了舞台形象，并编演了一些优秀的现代剧。如“搜书院”、“关汉卿”、“五侯宴”、“焚香记”、“三娘教子”、“赵云催归”、“李文茂起义”、“三帅困崤山”、“一枝花”、“梁天来”、“连环计”、“牡丹亭”、“马福龙卖箭”、“拜月记”、“刘胡兰”、“红花岗”、“红霞”、“崇高的职业”、“林冲”、“柳毅传书”等等，都是比较优秀的粤剧剧目。粤剧工作的伟大成就，应该首先归功于党的领导！
    我虽然演了多年的戏，但是在旧社会中，我演戏是不严肃的。那时候，我们根本不懂得什么创作方法之类的东西，也不愿意排戏，不愿意研究角色的创造，演出只是“台上相见”，到时候随意发挥。有时还强不知为知，摆架子吓人，耻于向人学习，要“维护”自己的“艺术尊严”。我们戏行有一句话：“每个人手里都有一把艺术刀，你杀我，我杀你！”意思就是说，同行如敌国，你争我夺，总以打倒别人为快事！这样从事艺术工作，怎能进步？这是彻头彻尾的资产阶级的艺术思想！解放以来，经过不断的学习，我逐渐认识到这种思想的错误，在党的教育下，开始寻求新的创作方法，探索新的道路。近年来，由于党的循循善诱，同志们的帮助，我的艺术观有了很大的改变。首先，我认识了艺术为社会主义服务的道理，我注意了思想性和艺术性的结合。我坚持一定要请导演排戏，每出戏一定要经过反复的研究排练，每个人物一定要经过仔细的分析研究和细致的设计动作。
    在排演“关汉卿”的时候，我进一步探索了革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作原则。首先是田汉同志的话剧本“关汉卿”所体现的革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义相结合的精神，深深地激动了我。我读了剧本之后，我为田汉同志的伟大的革命浪漫主义精神所激发，关汉卿的轩昂气质与高尚风格，使我受到了教育。于是，我决定改编田汉同志的剧本。在改编和演出“关汉卿”的时候，正是全民大跃进的时候，群众的跃进气概鼓舞了我，党和同志们都给予我极大的鼓励和帮助，使我的思想大大解放，受到了很大的启发。我觉得，首先应在“关汉卿”的剧本改编和演出中，充分体现革命浪漫主义的精神，把关汉卿这个人物的伟大气质表现得淋漓尽致。于是，我对关汉卿的作品进行了研究，我设计的关汉卿是一个对群众非常热爱、一个正义感非常强烈、倜傥风流、放荡不羁的黑暗社会中的战士。我和红线女等同志设计了“蝶双飞”一场的演出。我希望通过这一场戏造成一个高潮，充分体现革命的浪漫主义精神，热情澎湃地歌颂关汉卿和朱廉秀这两个人物，表现出他们伟大而美丽的理想，把这场戏搞得风格更高一些。同时，也按照我们的理解，把剧本的结局改成悲剧的结局，把其他各场的人物行动等仔细设计了一番，务求这出戏深刻动人，务求突出关汉卿朱廉秀不屈不挠的斗志以及他们的“烈魄英风万古春”的高贵品质。我们改编演出的“关汉卿”，受到了群众的热烈欢迎，这自然要首先归功于田汉同志的原著；同时，也应该说，“关汉卿”的成功，是因为我们遵循了革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，才能有这样的成功。当然，“关汉卿”的演出，特别是我扮演的关汉卿这一人物，还是很不够的，还有很多缺点尚待不断改正，还有待于进一步的加工丰富。
    在我创造关汉卿这一人物的时候所探求的革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义相结合的方法，是我的艺术生活中新的探索，新的道路的开始，是我永远不能忘记的！我现在懂得：只有以充沛的革命热情和严肃认真的态度，深入研究分析剧本和角色，深入挖掘角色的思想感情，想尽办法来表现角色的精神状貌，才能使角色真的活在舞台之上。我前些时候改编和演出过“屈原”，演出效果不大理想，当时，我未找到原因。经过“关汉卿”的演出，我回过头来一想，觉得“屈原”不够理想的原因，是我在处理这出戏的时候，革命的浪漫主义精神不足，缺乏充沛的革命热情，缺乏理想，思想不解放，没有以澎湃的激情充分表现屈原的爱国主义诗人的气质，而只是把他处理成为一个忠君爱国的大臣。我准备努力探索革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义的创作方法，把“屈原”重新修改，使它成为一个较好的剧目。
