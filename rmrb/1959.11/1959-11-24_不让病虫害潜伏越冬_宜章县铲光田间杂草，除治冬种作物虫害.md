Not Allowing Pests and Diseases to Lie Dormant Over Winter
Yizhang County Clears Field Weeds and Controls Pests of Winter Crops

Changsha, November 23rd (Our Dispatch) — Yizhang County, Hunan Province, is currently carrying out a large-scale campaign to eliminate overwintering pests and diseases. More than 50,000 people across the county are participating in this campaign. Weeds have been cleared from the edges of fields and plots of over 509,000 mu of paddy fields and dry land (accounting for 91% of the total area). All 115,000 mu of fallow winter paddy fields have been plowed. Winter crops found to have pests have been sprayed with pesticides. Diseased grass in 67,000 mu of fields has been completely treated.

Before liberation, Yizhang County suffered extremely serious damage from pests and diseases. In 1941 and 1946, locusts and rice borers caused disasters, reducing the county's production by 80%. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the farmers of the county launched a fierce struggle against pests and diseases. Especially during the Great Leap Forward last year, the county organized eight major battles, mobilizing up to 100,000 people at the peak, promptly suppressing rice planthoppers, and achieving a bumper harvest of grain, increasing production by 30.8% compared to 1957. In the past, rice blast, bacterial leaf blight, and sheath blight, like insect pests, seriously harmed grain production in the county. This year, measures were taken such as seed disinfection, treatment of diseased grass, and strengthening inspections during the seedling growth period, thereby curbing the spread of diseases and achieving a significant increase in grain production of about 46% compared to last year.

In order to further eliminate pests and diseases, the county Party committee decided to continue to carry out a large-scale mass pest control campaign this winter. The first phase was carried out around the "Frost's Descent" solar term, and the second phase after the "Beginning of Winter" solar term. During the campaign, Comrade Wang Xiangsheng, the first secretary of the county Party committee, went deep into Liyuan, Chishi, and other places to conduct inspections. The Party committee secretaries of each commune also personally directed and actively participated in and commanded the battles. Under the leadership of the Party committee, all localities implemented a "five-fix" (fixed person, fixed field, fixed time, fixed work points, fixed quality) responsibility system, launched emulation drives, and organized on-site visits. Through emulation drives, work efficiency was improved and the campaign was promoted. The Liyuan Commune worked hard for two days and two nights, completing the pest control task on more than 36,000 mu of fields. When members of the Bali Commune were digging sweet potatoes, they found soil with sweet potato weevils, which they marked with signs. A total of 5,034 mu of sweet potato soil in the commune had sweet potato weevils, and all were treated with 666 mixed with lime for poisoning during winter planting.

In order to seize the opportunity of the winter cold to eliminate bird and animal pests, Yizhang County plans to increase the number of hunting teams from 38 teams with 120 people to 72 teams with more than 500 people, and launch a mass bird hunting campaign during the Spring Festival. The county is preparing to establish a plant protection research institute, and communes will establish pest forecasting stations. Production brigades and production teams will establish pest forecasters, and each work group will cultivate two to three pest forecasters who can grasp the law of pest development. The county plans to build a large agricultural pesticide factory that combines indigenous and foreign methods, and communes, brigades, and teams must all establish indigenous pesticide factories. This winter, the county will conduct a comprehensive inspection and repair of existing agricultural machinery and plans to manufacture another 80,000 pieces of indigenous agricultural machinery.

    不让病虫害潜伏越冬
    宜章县铲光田间杂草，除治冬种作物虫害
    本报长沙23日电　湖南省宜章县正开展大规模的消灭越冬病虫害运动。全县投入这个运动的有五万多人，五十万九千多亩稻田和旱土（占总面积的91％）的田边地角已经铲光了杂草；十一万五千亩冬闲水田已全部犁翻了；冬种作物发现虫害的都全部用药喷杀了一遍；有六万七千亩田的病草，已全部处理了。
    宜章县在解放前病虫害为害极为严重。1941年和1946年，蝗虫和螟虫成灾，全县减产80％。解放后，全县农民在党的领导下，向病虫害展开了激烈的斗争。特别在去年大跃进中，全县曾组织八次大战，出动人数最多时达十万人以上，及时扑灭了稻飞虱，取得了比1957年增产30.8％的粮食大丰收。过去全县的稻瘟病、白叶枯、纹枯病也与虫害一样，严重危害着粮食的增产。今年采取了种子消毒，处理病草，加强禾苗生长期的检查，从而制止了病害的蔓延，夺取了粮食比去年增产46％左右的巨大成绩。
    为了进一步消灭病虫害，县委决定今冬继续开展大规模的群众性的治虫运动。第一次是在“霜降”节前后进行，第二次是在“立冬”节后。在运动中，县委第一书记王祥生同志，深入到栗源、赤石等地进行检查。各公社党委书记也是亲临指导，积极参加战斗和指挥战斗。在党委领导下，各地都实行了“五定”（定人、定田、定时间、定工分、定质量）的责任制度，开展了评比竞赛，组织现场 参观。通过评比竞赛，提高了工效，推动了运动。栗源公社苦战两天两晚，完成了三万六千多亩田土的治虫任务。巴力公社的社员在挖红薯时，发现有小象鼻虫的土，就插上牌子做标记，全社共有五千零三十四亩薯土有小象鼻虫，在冬种时，已全部用六六六拌石灰进行了毒杀。
    宜章县为了抓住冬寒时机消灭鸟兽害，全县的打猎队伍计划由三十八个队一百二十人，增加到七十二个队五百多人，在春节期间来一次群众性的打鸟运动。县里准备成立植物保护研究所，公社成立虫情预报站，大队、生产队、作业组建立虫情预报员，每个作业组培养二至三个能掌握虫情发展规律的虫情预报员。县里计划办一个由土到洋的大农药厂，社社队队都要建立土农药厂。今冬全县对现有农械进行全面大检查大修理，计划再制造八万部土农械。
