    Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd, Paris dispatch: After the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria announced the appointment of five imprisoned Algerian leaders as representatives to negotiate with the French government, French President De Gaulle, who is currently traveling in eastern France, expressed his refusal to this suggestion in a series of speeches. In a speech on the 20th, he said that it was now up to some Algerians who "have been fighting" to "take the path we invite them to take." He said, "Of course, I am referring to those who are fighting, not those who are outside the battle." Agence France-Presse reported that De Gaulle's words indicated that he would refuse to negotiate with these representatives of the Algerian Provisional Government.
    In another speech on the 22nd, De Gaulle further accused the proposal of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria of "raising bizarre conditions for the talks proposed" by France. He said, "We hope to achieve peace in Algeria through the only path we have chosen that will allow France to remain in Algeria."
    According to Agence France-Presse on the 20th, "sources close to the French government" emphasized that the French government would only negotiate with Algerian "rebel (referring to the Algerian Provisional Government) leaders" who are "fighting in Algeria" and "abroad," and that "rebel leaders" "imprisoned in France" were not included. These sources also said that the negotiations mentioned by the French authorities "have no political nature" and "only discuss methods of achieving a ceasefire and the direct consequences of the ceasefire."
    Some French bourgeois newspapers have also made a lot of noise about the proposal of the Algerian Provisional Government, opposing this suggestion. Many French bourgeois newspapers, including "l'Aurore," attacked the proposal of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria as a "provocative expression rather than a trend toward reconciliation."
    French extremists are even more noisy and disruptive. A member of the National Assembly's Independent Party slandered the declaration of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria as "insulting, and France cannot accept it under any circumstances."

    殖民主义者的凶恶面目毕露
    戴高乐拒绝同阿临时政府谈判
    新华社23日讯　巴黎消息：在阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府宣布任命五位被法国政府监禁的阿尔及利亚领袖作为代表同法国政府谈判以后，正在法国东部旅行的法国总统戴高乐在接连发表的几次演说中表示拒绝这个建议。他20日在一次演说中说，现在该由一些“一直在作战”的阿尔及利亚人“走我们邀请他们走的道路”。他说，“当然，我所说的是那些正在作战的人。而不是说那些置身于战斗以外的人”。法新社在报道戴高乐这些话时认为，这是戴高乐表示他将拒绝同阿尔及利亚临时政府这些代表谈判。
    在22日发表的另一次演说中，戴高乐进而指责阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的建议对法国“建议的会谈提出离奇的条件”。他说，“我们希望通过我们选择的使法国留在阿尔及利亚的唯一道路，来实现阿尔及利亚和平。”
    据法新社20日报道，“接近法国政府的人士”强调法国政府只同“在阿尔及利亚作战的”和“在国外的”阿尔及利亚“叛乱（指阿尔及利亚临时政府）领袖”谈判，而“监禁在法国的”“叛乱领袖”不在此例。这些人士还说，法国当局所说的谈判“没有任何政治性质”，而“只是谈实现停火的方法和停火的直接后果”。
    法国一些资产阶级报纸也就阿尔及利亚临时政府的建议纷纷鼓噪叫嚣，反对这个建议。包括“震旦报”在内的许多法国资产阶级报纸攻击阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的建议是“挑衅的表示，而不是和解的趋势”。
    法国的极端分子更是大吵大闹。国民议会独立党议员诬蔑阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的声明是“侮辱性的，无论如何法国不能接受”。
