Inexhaustible Wild Resources

    According to preliminary surveys and estimations over the past few years, more than 400 kinds of wild plant oilseeds have been discovered across the country, with resources exceeding one million tons. After several years of testing, pressing, and utilization, it has been proven that more than 220 kinds contain more than 15% oil, which is generally higher than the oil content of soybeans. Some even exceed major oilseeds such as peanuts and sesame, with oil content reaching around 70%. Major varieties include cocklebur, alkali herbs, papaya seeds, camphor tree seeds, prickly ash seeds, and crowdipper seeds. According to estimates from the commercial sector, 250,000 tons of wild plant oilseeds can be pressed into about 30,000 tons of oil, roughly equivalent to the oil production of 1.5 million mu of soybeans. Wild plant oil can be used as industrial raw materials for soap, paint, ink, and lubricating oil. Oil cakes can be used as feed and fertilizer. If all of it is used for fertilizing fields, it can increase grain production by 500,000 tons; if half of it is used as feed, it can raise 1.2 million pigs.
    More than 300 kinds of wild plants and wild fruits that can be used for brewing wine and extracting starch have been discovered in various regions, with resources exceeding seven million tons. Major varieties include acorns, kudzu root, bracken root, lycoris radiata, konjac, wild grapes, crabapples, wild medlar, and water caltrop. The initial plan for this year is to purchase two million tons, which can brew 500,000 tons of wine, roughly equivalent to the value of over 2 billion jin of grain. Among wild plant starch raw materials, some can be used to extract starch to replace flour for sizing and making paste. Some are also important adhesive raw materials, such as konjac gum, which has been widely used in the textile, construction, and leather industries in Shanghai and other places.
    More than 400 kinds of wild plant fibers have been discovered in various regions, with resources exceeding ten million tons. Among them, the main ones include Chinese alpine rush, Apocynum venetum, Bombax ceiba bark, Hibiscus manihot, and Broussonetia papyrifera bark. The vast majority of wild plant fibers can be used as raw materials for papermaking. For example, Chinese alpine rush and Bombax ceiba bark are important raw materials for making high-grade paper and tracing paper. Some can be used to replace hemp for making ropes and weaving sacks. Last year, large-scale hemp spinning mills across the country universally promoted the use of wild fibers mixed with jute to make sacks and hemp cloth. Up to 40% of wild hemp fibers can be mixed with jute, and the quality is very good. Some more advanced wild fibers, such as Apocynum venetum and ramie, can be used for spinning and weaving.
    More than 80 kinds of wild plant tannin raw materials have been discovered in various regions, with resources of approximately four million tons. The main ones include red root, acorn cups, Quercus bark, Lysimachia foenum-graecum, lacquer tree leaves, and Dioscorea cirrhosa. These wild tannin raw materials not only have high yields but also produce good quality tannin. Tannin factories in Hubei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and other places have adopted them in large quantities.
    Various aromatic plant resources such as Litsea cubeba, Nardostachys jatamansi, and Liriodendron chinense have also been discovered in various regions, which can be used to extract various fragrances and perfumes. It is truly a social and material force that is "inexhaustible and inexhaustible."

    取之不尽的野生资源
    根据几年来的初步勘察和估算，全国各地发现的野生植物油料有四百多种，资源在一百万吨以上。几年来经过化验、试榨和利用，证明含油量在15％以上的已有二百二十多种，一般都高于大豆的含油量，有的还超过花生、芝麻等主要油料，含油量达70％左右。主要品种有苍耳子、盐蒿子、木瓜子、樟树子、花椒子、乌子等。据商业部门估算：野生植物油料二十五万吨，可榨油三万吨左右，约相当于一百五十万亩大豆的产油量。野生植物油可供作肥皂、油漆、油墨、润滑油等工业原料，油饼子可作饲料和肥料。如果全部用来肥田，可增产粮食五十万吨；一半用作饲料，可养猪一百二十万头。
    各地发现可供酿酒和提制淀粉的野生植物和野生水果有三百多种，资源在七百万吨以上。主要品种有橡子、葛根、厥根、石蒜、蘑芋、山葡萄、金樱子、山丁子、野菱角等。今年初步计划收购二百万吨，可酿酒五十万吨，约相当于二十多亿斤粮食的价值。在野生植物淀粉原料中，有些可提制淀粉，代替面粉浆纱、制浆糊；有的还是重要胶剂原料，如蘑芋胶在上海等地已广泛地用于纺织、建筑、皮革等工业上。
    各地发现的野生植物纤维有四百多种，资源在一千万吨以上。其中主要有龙须草、罗布麻、山棉皮、芙蓉麻、桷树皮等。在野生植物纤维中，绝大部分可作造纸原料。如龙须草、山棉皮等还是制造高级纸、皮蜡纸的重要原料；有的可以代替麻用，用以打绳索，织麻袋。去年全国大型麻纺厂已普遍推广利用野生纤维与黄麻混纺制麻袋和麻布，最高可以用40％的野生麻类纤维与黄麻混纺，质量很好。有些更高级的野生纤维，如罗布麻、水麻等，可以用来纺纱织布。
    各地还发现野生植物栲胶原料八十多种，资源约在四百万吨以上。主要有红根、橡碗、桷皮、花香果、漆树叶、薯莨等。这些野生栲胶原料，不但单产量高，而且所制栲胶质量也很好，湖北、陕西、四川等地的栲胶厂已大量采用。
    各地还发现山苍子、蜘蛛香、鹅掌秋等很多芳香植物资源，可以提制各种香精香料。真是“取之不尽，用之不竭”的社会巨大物质力量。
