Xinhua News Agency, Athens, November 24th: According to TASS, the Greek Athens Military Court of Appeals announced on the 23rd that it refused the appeal to overturn the unjust verdict against Glezos and other patriotic people. In this way, the Greek authorities, in defiance of the protests from the Greek and world public, are still determined to keep Glezos and other democrats in prison.

The well-known Western jurists Moore and Aroniánu protested on the 23rd against the deprivation of the right to appeal for Glezos and other patriotic people sentenced with him.

The defense lawyers of Glezos and others pointed out that the trial of Glezos was conducted in violation of Greek law. This alone is reason enough to demand that the verdict be overturned and the case retried. While refusing the appeals of Glezos and others, the Greek authorities agreed to the request of the Attorney General of the Athens Court of Appeals, namely: to overturn the verdict of innocence recently announced by the Athens Criminal Court in the case of Glezos and "Dawn Daily" being accused of "insulting the government." The authorities decided to retry this case on December 23. Therefore, Glezos is facing a new persecution.

    希腊当局竟拒绝撤销不公正判决
    格列索斯面临新迫害
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社雅典讯：希腊雅典军事上诉法庭23日宣布，拒绝要求撤销对格列索斯和其他一些爱国人士的不公正的判决的上诉。这样，希腊当局就悍然不顾希腊和世界公众的纷纷抗议，仍然要把格列索斯和其他一些民主人士关在监牢里。
    西方著名的法学家穆尔和阿罗内亚努23日表示抗议剥夺格列索斯和同他一起被判刑的其他爱国人士的上诉权利。
    格列索斯等的辩护律师曾经指出，对格列索斯的审讯是在违反希腊法律的情况下进行的。仅这一点，就有理由要求撤销判决，重新审理这个案件。希腊当局在拒绝格列索斯等人的上诉的同时，却同意了雅典上诉法庭检察长的要求，就是：取消不久以前雅典刑事法庭在关于格列索斯和
  “黎明日报”被控“污辱政府”一案中宣布被告无罪的判决。当局决定在12月23日重新审理这一案件。因此，格列索斯面临着一次新的迫害。
