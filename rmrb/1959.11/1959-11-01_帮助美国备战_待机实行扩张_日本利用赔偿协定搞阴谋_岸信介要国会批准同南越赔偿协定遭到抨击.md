Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 31st: The Japanese Diet's extraordinary session is currently discussing the war reparations agreement illegally signed by the Kishi Nobusuke government and the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique. On the 30th, the Kishi Nobusuke government formally submitted this illegal agreement to the Diet, attempting to get it approved, which was met with strong criticism from opposition party members. The Japanese public pointed out that this agreement violates the Geneva Accords and is a tool for the Kishi Nobusuke government to assist the United States in promoting its war policy in Indochina and profiting from it.

The Japanese war reparations agreement with South Vietnam was signed on May 13 this year. The agreement stipulates that Japan will pay the Ngo Dinh Diem clique $39 million in "pure reparations" within five years, and will also provide $7.5 million in loans and $9.1 million in "economic cooperation" expenses. This total of $55.6 million in reparations will be used to build the Loc Ninh power station needed to supply military bases, an arsenal, and a urea plant that manufactures stabilizers for synthetic explosives. It is clear that the signing of this reparations agreement is not a post-war settlement measure, but rather to help the United States prepare for a new war in South Vietnam.

Japan has been using war reparations to seize markets and implement economic expansion. Before signing the war reparations agreement with South Vietnam, Japan had already signed war reparations agreements with Burma, the Philippines, and Indonesia, stipulating that Japan would pay nearly $1 billion in war reparations in total. These reparations payments have actually turned into Japanese capital and commodity exports to these countries and regions. According to the August issue of "World" magazine, war reparations paid by Japan in 1956 accounted for 36% of the total foreign capital input in Burma in the same year; 22% of the total foreign capital input in the Philippines in the same year; and 17.5% of the total foreign capital input in Indonesia in the same year.

When signing war reparations agreements with its counterparts, Japan always forces the other party to sign treaties of commerce and navigation, forcing the other party to guarantee most-favored-nation treatment. When signing the reparations agreement with South Vietnam, the two sides also issued a joint declaration stating that they would "find ways to sign a treaty of commerce and navigation as soon as possible." At the same time, each reparations agreement is accompanied by so-called "economic cooperation" clauses or subsidiary agreements, stipulating that the Japanese government or private enterprises provide loans and investments to the contracting party to expand Japan's economic power. These types of funds total $744 million. This is why Japanese monopoly capitalists cheered and said: after losing military orders from the Korean battlefield, war reparations are simply "heaven-sent" for Japan. Japan also uses reparations to forcibly sell products with low competitiveness and slow-moving goods in the international market, and the prices are much higher than international prices. For example, the three cargo ships of more than 5,000 tons each that Japan gave to the Philippines as reparations were each a quarter or a third more expensive than the usual price.

### 帮助美国备战　待机实行扩张  日本利用赔偿协定搞阴谋  岸信介要国会批准同南越赔偿协定遭到抨击

    帮助美国备战　待机实行扩张
    日本利用赔偿协定搞阴谋
    岸信介要国会批准同南越赔偿协定遭到抨击
    据新华社31日讯　东京消息：日本国会临时会议正在讨论岸信介政府和南越吴庭艳集团非法签订的战争赔偿协定。30日，岸信介政府正式向国会提出了这个非法的协定，企图让国会批准，遭到了反对党议员的强烈抨击。日本公众指出，这个协定违反了日内瓦协议，是岸信介政府帮助美国在印度支那推行战争政策并从中取利的一个工具。
    日本对南越的战争赔偿协定是今年5月13日签订的。协定规定，日本将在五年内向吴庭艳集团支付三千九百万美元的“纯粹赔偿”，另外还将提供七百五十万美元的贷款和九百一十万美元的“经济合作”费用。这笔总额五千五百六十万美元的赔偿将用于修建供应军事基地需要的禄宁发电站、一座兵工厂和一座制造合成炸药安定剂的尿素工厂。由此可见，签订这个赔偿协定不是战争善后的措施，而是为了帮助美国在南越准备新战争。
    日本一直在利用战争赔偿来占领市场，实行经济扩张。在同南越签订战争赔偿协定以前，日本已经同缅甸、菲律宾、印度尼西亚签订了战争赔偿协定，规定日本总共支付战争赔偿近十亿美元。这些赔偿支付，实际上变成日本向这些国家和地区的资本和商品输出。据8月号的“世界”杂志报道，日本在1956年内支付的战争赔偿占缅甸同年内输入外国资本总额的36％；占菲律宾同年内输入外国资本总额的22％；占印度尼西亚同年内输入外国资本总额的17.5％。
    日本在同对方签订战争赔偿协定时，总是要挟对方签订通商航海条约，迫使对方保证给予最惠国待遇。在同南越签订赔偿协定时，双方也发表过联合宣言，表示要“设法早日签订通商航海条约”。同时，每一个赔偿协定都附有所谓“经济合作”条款或附属协定，规定日本政府或私人企业向签约对方提供贷款和投资，用来扩张日本经济势力。这类款项总共达七亿四千四百万美元。这便是为什么日本的垄断资本家们欢呼道：在失去了朝鲜战场上的军需订货之后，战争赔偿对日本来说简直是“天佑神助”。日本还通过赔偿强行推销它在国际市场中竞争能力低的产品和滞销品，而且计价要比国际价格高得多。例如，日本作为赔偿给菲律宾的三艘五千多吨的载货轮船，每艘都比一般定价贵四分之一或三分之一。
