Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: The twenty-two provinces (cities) and districts in the national winter wheat producing areas have victoriously exceeded this year's winter wheat sowing plan, and the sowing quality is very good. At present, most of the wheat has emerged, and the growth is generally good. Many areas are strengthening field management, carrying out seedling inspection and replanting, applying root-pressing fertilizer, and irrigating root-establishing water, striving to successfully pass the winter tillering stage of wheat.

In implementing the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, various regions have opposed right-leaning tendencies and boosted morale, making this year's winter wheat sowing early and the progress fast. In the northern winter wheat areas where sowing began earlier, most of the sowing was done from White Dew to Frost's Descent, and it ended ten to fifteen days earlier than in previous years, and the sowing plan has now been exceeded; the southern winter wheat areas, where sowing began later, have also basically completed this year's wheat sowing plan. At present, wheat sowing in Sichuan and Zhejiang is being carried out in a concentrated sprint to finish, and Guangdong and Fujian are about to enter the busy stage of winter wheat sowing.

This year, people's communes in various regions have thoroughly implemented the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture" in the sowing of winter wheat, and the sowing quality has been greatly improved compared with previous years. In the eleven provinces and regions of Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, etc., more than 80% of the sown wheat was deep-plowed to a depth of six inches to one foot or more, two to three inches deeper than in previous years, and the phenomenon of sowing in hardened fields has been basically eliminated; 90% of the wheat fields were fertilized as a base fertilizer, which is about 20% more than in previous years; 90% of the area has been rationally and densely planted according to local conditions, with a sowing amount of generally fifteen to twenty catties; the winter irrigation area will be doubled compared with last year, of which more than 190 million mu are guaranteed to be fully irrigated. This year, high-yield winter wheat fields in various regions generally account for 20% to 30% of the wheat field area. Various regions have also prominently strengthened the sowing work in distant fields, thin fields, and low-yielding fields, so the sowing quality of these fields is also greatly improved compared with previous years.

This year, nineteen provinces and regions have been fighting drought to rush-plant wheat. From the end of September to October, extensive areas in central and southern China experienced varying degrees of autumn drought after the summer drought. The drought-stricken areas covered thirteen provinces and regions including Hubei, Anhui, Henan, and Shandong. Therefore, in the drought-stricken areas, some of the land was difficult to cultivate. In order to strive for a good wheat harvest next year, various drought-stricken areas have used the rich experience of fighting drought in the summer and have given full play to the enormous role of the large number of water conservancy projects built since the Great Leap Forward last year, and have launched a mass movement to fight drought and sow seeds, ensuring the progress and quality of sowing. People's communes in the main wheat-producing areas in the north, such as Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, and Shanxi, and in the wheat-producing areas in the south, such as Hubei Province, organized large-scale cooperation of manpower, animal power, water sources, and irrigation and drainage machinery to rush to fight drought and sow seeds, so they generally completed or exceeded the task of sowing winter wheat on time.

At present, early-sown wheat has tillered and established roots, and late-sown wheat has also mostly emerged. In the spirit of early sowing and early management, and good sowing and good management, various regions have organized specialized wheat field management teams to focus on wheat field management such as seedling inspection, replanting, topdressing, irrigation, and pest control. Henan, Shandong, and Shaanxi provinces have inspected and replanted more than 26.9 million mu of seedlings, and Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces have topdressed more than 23.17 million mu, irrigated 7.25 million mu, and suppressed and hoeed more than 13.9 million mu. Wheat rust has occurred in some wheat fields in Shandong, Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang and other provinces and regions, and these regions have launched prevention and control efforts, determined to eliminate wheat rust. Hebei, Jiangsu and other provinces have proposed to eliminate third-class seedlings in the seedling stage. (Attached picture)

### 全国冬小麦播种计划超额完成  各地查苗补苗追肥浇灌争取过好小麦越冬分蘖关

    全国冬小麦播种计划超额完成
    各地查苗补苗追肥浇灌争取过好小麦越冬分蘖关
    新华社23日讯　全国冬小麦产区二十二个省（市）区已胜利地超额完成了今年冬小麦的播种计划，播种质量很好。目前，绝大部分小麦已出苗，生长一般良好，许多地区正加强麦田管理，进行查苗补苗，追施压根肥，浇灌盘根水，争取过好小麦越冬分蘖关。
    各地在贯彻党的八届八中全会决议中，反右倾、鼓干劲，使今年冬小麦播种早，进度快。播种季节较早的北方冬麦区，大部在白露到霜降播种的，而又比往年提早十天到半月结束，现已超额完成了播种计划；播种较晚的南方冬麦区也已基本完成了今年的小麦播种计划。目前，四川、浙江小麦播种正在突击扫尾，广东、福建即将进入播种冬麦大忙阶段。
    今年各地人民公社在播种冬小麦中，都深入贯彻了“农业八字宪法”，播种质量比往年有很大提高。山西、河北、山东、河南、陕西、甘肃等十一个省区播种的小麦，有80％多深耕在六寸到一尺以上，比往年加深了两寸到三寸，并基本消灭了板田下种现象；90％的麦田施了底肥，这比往年扩大了20％左右；90％的面积都因地制宜地进行了合理密植，播种量一般在十五斤到二十斤；冬灌面积将比去年扩大一倍，其中保证吃饱喝足的面积有一亿九千多万亩。今年各地冬小麦丰产田一般占麦田面积的20％到30％。各地还突出地加强了远田、薄地和低产田的播种工作，因而这些田的播种质量比往年也有很大提高。
    今年有十九个省区是抗旱抢种小麦的。9月底10月间，我国中部和南部广大地区继夏旱之后又发生了不同程度的秋旱，受旱地区遍及湖北、安徽、河南、山东等十三个省区，因此，受旱地区有部分的土地耕种困难。为了争取明年小麦丰收，各受旱地区运用今年夏季抗旱斗争的丰富经验，充分发挥去年大跃进以来兴修的大量水利工程的巨大作用，并发动群众开展了抗旱播种运动，保证了播种进度和质量。北方主要产麦区的河南、山东、陕西、山西四省和南方产麦区的湖北等省的人民公社组织人力、畜力、水源、排灌机械等大协作，突击进行抗旱播种，因而一般都按时完成或超额完成了播种冬麦的任务。
    目前，早种的小麦已分蘖盘根，晚种的小麦也多已出土。各地本着早种早管，种好管好的精神，都已组织了麦田管理专业队，大抓查苗、补苗、追肥、灌水、治虫等麦田管理。河南、山东、陕西三省已查苗补苗二千六百九十多万亩，山西、河北、山东、河南、陕西五省已追肥两千三百一十七万多亩，灌水七百二十五万亩，镇压、锄耙一千三百九十多万亩。山东、陕西、甘肃、新疆等省区部分麦田发生锈病，这些地区已开展防治，决心歼灭小麦锈病。河北、江苏等省提出把三类苗消灭在幼苗期。（附图片）
