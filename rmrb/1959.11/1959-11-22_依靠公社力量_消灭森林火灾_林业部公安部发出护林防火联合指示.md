Relying on Commune Strength to Eliminate Forest Fires
Ministry of Forestry and Ministry of Public Security Issue Joint Instructions on Forest Fire Prevention

This newspaper reports that the Ministry of Forestry and the Ministry of Public Security recently issued "Joint Instructions on Strengthening Forest Fire Prevention Work." The instructions point out: The mountain fire danger season has arrived. Especially in some areas of the South, drought conditions have been severe since summer and autumn, and fires have already occurred in a few areas. Forestry and public security departments in forest areas must, in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, overcome right-leaning thoughts, continue to exert great effort, and under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, mobilize the masses, strengthen collaboration, and actively take effective measures to strive for further elimination of forest fires.

The joint instructions especially emphasize that in forest fire prevention work, the superiority of the people's communes must be fully utilized. The people's commune system has brought significant superior conditions to forest fire prevention work. In the past year, many areas have greatly reduced forest fires due to the good combination of forest protection with rectification of the commune and various productions. Therefore, to carry out the movement of no forest fires, it is necessary to practically utilize the power of the people's communes, specifically assist the people's communes in rectifying and establishing fire prevention organizations, planning fire prevention measures, and establishing fire prevention systems.

The instructions also point out: With the continued great leap forward in various productions, the number of people engaged in forest area prospecting, mining, capital construction, and sideline production is still increasing continuously. Forest area enterprises have also added some new workers. Most of these personnel come from other regions and various departments, generally do not have fire prevention habits, and have more fire-using activities. The relevant departments in the forest area must effectively organize and manage them. In addition to organizing fire prevention according to their production departments and strengthening education for them, it is also necessary to clearly define fire prevention systems according to their production characteristics.

The instructions require forestry and public security departments, within the possible scope, to organize forces, take measures, and strengthen the work on the edges of large forest areas. There should be special regulations for burning wasteland, and small losses must not be allowed to result in big losses. Actively improve the existing traffic and communication facilities in forest areas, and strengthen ground patrols and fire observation work. In areas where fires have been serious in previous years, especially in areas where forests and grasslands are adjacent, such as Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, we should seize the favorable opportunity of autumn and winter to vigorously open firebreaks and prepare to isolate the spread of fires.

The instructions also require local forestry and public security departments, under the unified leadership of the local Party and government, to deeply study the work characteristics of their region, combine forest fire prevention with safeguarding social order, protecting production, and protecting the property of the state and the people, and use various opportunities to thoroughly carry out publicity and education on forest fire prevention.

    依靠公社力量　消灭森林火灾
    林业部公安部发出护林防火联合指示
    本报讯　林业部、公安部最近发出了“关于加强护林防火工作的联合指示”。指示指出：目前山火危险季节已经来临。特别是南方某些地区，夏秋以来旱情严重，火灾已提前在少数地区发生。林区的林业和公安部门，必须根据八届八中全会指示的精神，克服右倾思想，继续鼓足干劲，在当地党委的统一领导下，发动群众，加强协作，积极采取有效措施，力争进一步消灭森林火灾。
    联合指示特别强调在护林防火工作中，要充分发挥人民公社的优越性。人民公社化给护林防火工作带来了显著的优越条件。一年来，不少地区由于护林和整社、各项生产结合得好，森林火灾大大的减少了。因此，开展无森林火灾运动，必须切实发挥人民公社的威力，具体帮助人民公社，整顿和建立防火组织，规划防火措施，订立防火制度。
    指示还指出：随着各项生产的继续跃进，林区勘探采矿、基本建设和副业生产等人员，仍在陆续增加。林区企业也增加了一些新工人。这些人员，大多来自其他地区和各个部门，一般没有防火习惯，用火活动也较多，林区有关部门，对他们必须切实加以组织管理。除应按照他们的生产部门，进行防火组织，并加强对他们的教育外，还必须按照他们的生产特点，明确定出防火制度。
    指示要求林业、公安部门，在可能范围内，组织力量，采取措施，加强大林区的边沿工作。烧荒要有特别的规定，不得为小失大。积极改善现有林区的交通通讯设施，加强地面巡逻和火情了望工作。在历年火灾严重的地区，特别是东北、内蒙古等森林和草原毗连的地区，应抓住秋冬季有利时机，大力开辟防火线，做好隔绝火灾的蔓延准备。
    指示还要求各地林业、公安部门，在当地党政的统一领导下，深入研究本地区的工作特点，把护林防火同保卫社会治安、保卫生产、保卫国家和人民的财产结合起来，利用各种机会，深入开展护林防火的宣传教育。（附图片）
