    Sichuan Chemical Plant Begins Production
    China's newest modern chemical plant, the Sichuan Chemical Plant, has begun producing chemical fertilizers, with nearly 10,000 tons to be produced in the fourth quarter.
    The Sichuan Chemical Plant, which began construction in February of last year, is being built in stages. Currently, the first phase of the three major projects related to chemical fertilizer production—synthetic ammonia, ammonium sulfate, and the sulfuric acid system—have been completed one and a half to three and a half months ahead of schedule. This chemical plant is the first large-scale modern chemical enterprise designed domestically.

    四川化工厂开始生产
    我国又一座现代化化学工厂——四川化工厂开始生产化学肥料，第四季度即将生产上万吨。
    四川化工厂自去年二月动工，分批进行建设。现在，第一期有关化学肥料生产的合成氨、硫酸铵、硫酸一系统等三大工程已经提前一个半月到三个半月建成。这个化工厂是第一个由国内自己设计的大型现代化化学企业。
