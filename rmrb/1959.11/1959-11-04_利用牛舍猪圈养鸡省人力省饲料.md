The state-run farms in Changxindian, Southern Suburbs, Northern Suburbs, Eastern Suburbs, and Shuangqiao in the suburbs of Beijing have greatly saved labor and feed by raising chickens in cattle and pig pens.

When chickens are raised in cattle and pig pens, the feed left over and dropped in the pens by the pigs and cattle, as well as undigested feed in the animal waste, and various pests in the pens, all serve as chicken feed. These farms only give some supplementary feed at night when the chickens go to roost, and the chickens become fat. This method of feeding saves 60% to 70% of feed compared to general feeding methods.

The state-run farms such as Changxindian raise more than 400 chickens in one cattle or pig pen, which are taken care of by the cattle or pig workers, which also saves labor for raising chickens.

    利用牛舍猪圈养鸡省人力省饲料
    北京市郊区长辛店、南郊、北郊、东郊和双桥等国营农场，把鸡养在牛舍和猪圈里，大大节省了人力和饲料。
    利用牛舍猪圈养鸡，猪牛吃剩和丢落在圈舍里的饲料，以及畜粪里没有消化的饲料，圈舍里的各种害虫，都是鸡的饲料。这些农场每天只在晚上鸡上架时给一些补充饲料，就把鸡养肥了。这样饲养比一般饲养节省饲料百分之六十到百分之七十。
    长辛店等国营农场在一个牛舍或猪圈里放养鸡四百多只，由养牛或养猪工人一并照管，这又节省了养鸡的人力。
