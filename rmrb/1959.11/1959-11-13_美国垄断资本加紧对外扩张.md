    U.S. Monopoly Capital Intensifies Foreign Expansion
    Editor's Note: The November 9th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" reported that U.S. monopoly capital is accelerating its penetration into Western Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world. Extracts are translated below:
    The number of U.S. companies operating abroad has greatly increased.
  From 1952 to 1958, the number of industrial companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange that have operations abroad increased by nearly 50%. At the end of 1958, there were at least 2,233 such companies.
    National Cash Register Company has operations in thirty-eight countries, the widest geographical distribution. Three oil companies—Standard Oil of New Jersey, Standard Oil of New York—each has operations in thirty or more countries.
    In 1958, U.S. companies' direct investment in foreign operations was about $3 billion. This figure has increased significantly this year.
    Here are some of the latest news about the expansion of U.S. companies abroad: Firestone Tire & Rubber Company continues to develop abroad. The company recently planned to build a tire factory worth millions of dollars in France and to build a synthetic rubber factory near this tire factory. It also assumed half of the construction costs of a synthetic rubber factory in India.
    The Netherlands recently opened its first synthetic rubber factory, which is a joint venture between U.S. Goodrich Corporation and a Dutch company.
    Dow Chemical is planning to establish plastics factories in Australia and Greece. The company is currently expanding in Japan and the United Kingdom.
    The typewriter factory built by Royal McBee Corporation in Leiden, Netherlands, will be completed in mid-1960. This factory produces portable typewriters for the U.S. market.
    Singer Sewing Machine Company is shifting its production to engage in fierce competition with Japanese and Italian sewing machine manufacturers.
    Deere & Company, which produces agricultural machinery, has found that the sales volume of its overseas branches exceeds its sales volume in the United States and Canada.
    Magnavox Company, which is entering the international market for the first time, is preparing to purchase a large electronics company located in London.
    Many U.S. companies have acquired profitable enterprises in Western Europe. For example: British Vic Chemical Company, a German (referring to West Germany - translator's note) automated restaurant equipment factory, Italian Allis-Chalmers Electrical Company and Sylvania Electric Products Inc. – a subsidiary of General Telephone and Electronics Corporation – and Swedish American Machine and Foundry Company.
    The common desire of these U.S. companies is to make profits quickly. Acquiring a company is much more effective than building your own factory and equipping it, and hiring workers. Especially in Germany (referring to West Germany - translator's note) it is very difficult to hire workers. By acquiring an operating company, you get a batch of workers.

### 美国垄断资本加紧对外扩张

    美国垄断资本加紧对外扩张
    编者按：11月9日“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志报道，美国垄断资本正在加速渗入西欧、亚洲和世界其他地方。现摘译如下：
    美国在国外经营的公司的数目，大大地增多了。
  从1952年到1958年，在纽约股票市场挂牌的在国外有营业的工业公司数目，增加了将近50％。在1958年年底，至少有二千二百三十三家这样的公司。
    国民现金出纳机公司在三十八个国家有营业，地理分布最广。三家石油公司——新泽西美孚油公司、纽约美孚油公司——每一个都在三十或三十个以上的国家里有营业。
    1958年，美国企业在国外经营方面的直接投资约为三十亿美元。这个数字今年显著地增加了。
    以下是美国企业向国外扩张的一些最新的消息：费尔通轮胎及橡胶公司继续向国外发展。该公司最近计划在法国建造一所价值数百万美元的轮胎工厂，并在这个轮胎工厂附近建造一个人造橡胶工厂。它还担负了印度一所人造橡胶工厂建造费用的一半。
    荷兰最近开设了第一座人造橡胶工厂，这家工厂是美国古德里奇公司与一家荷兰公司合股经营的。
    道化学公司正在澳大利亚及希腊筹设塑料工厂。该公司目前在日本及英国均有扩张。
    皇家麦克比公司在荷兰来顿建造的打字机工厂将于1960年年中完工。这个工厂生产供销美国市场的手提打字机。
    胜家缝纫机制造公司在生产方面转向与日本、意大利缝纫机制造商展开尖锐竞争。
    生产农业机械的第尔公司，发现它的海外分支机构的销售量，超过了它在美国和加拿大的销售量。
    初次进入国际市场的马格纳孚克斯公司正准备购买位置在伦敦的一个大的电子企业。
    许多美国公司在西欧收买了有利可图的企业。例如：英国的维克化学公司、德国（指西德——译注）的自动化餐厅设备工厂、意大利的艾利斯·查默斯电气公司和西万尼亚电器材料公司——通用电话和电子公司的子公司——以及瑞典的美国机器制造和翻砂公司。
    这些美国公司的共同愿望是迅速获利。收买一家公司，比建立自己的工厂和进行装备以及招雇工人，收效要大得多。尤其是在德国（指西德——译注）招雇工人十分不易。收买一个开业的公司，你就得到一批工人。
