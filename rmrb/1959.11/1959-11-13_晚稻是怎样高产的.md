How Late Rice Achieves High Yields
Zhao Jiande, First Secretary of the CCP Liling County Committee

In the first year of the People's Communes, Liling County's agricultural production achieved a new victory of late rice surpassing early rice, building on the great leap forward of the previous year.

"From the masses, to the masses." We have gained a deeper understanding of this kind teaching of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao from this year's movement of "Double-Season Late Rice Competing with Early Rice".

On the eve of the early rice harvest, the broad masses of farmers, with the excited mood of early rice harvest, were calculating the tricks of late rice competing with early rice. When the cadres and masses of the Huamai Tian Brigade of Nanqiao Commune were summarizing the experience of this year's early rice bumper harvest and studying measures to strive for a greater late rice bumper harvest, they thought of the fact that last year's eighty-three mu of double-season late rice achieved a high yield of an average of nine hundred and ten jin per mu. They exclaimed happily: "This is the example!" They summarized that the main experiences of these high-yielding late rice fields were: transplanting seedlings before the Great Heat, deep plowing, applying sufficient base fertilizer, reasonable close planting, and strengthening field management. Everyone also unanimously believed that with the People's Commune this year and the experience of last year's Great Leap Forward, it is possible for double-season late rice to surpass early rice. According to the demands of the masses of this brigade, the Nanqiao Commune Party Committee took the lead and launched a proposal to the whole county to "Double-Season Late Rice Competing with Early Rice". This proposal, like a prairie fire, quickly spread throughout the county.

Just as the enthusiasm of the masses was high, a small number of people inside and outside the Party with serious right-leaning ideas poured cold water on the masses, saying that "late rice has been low-yielding" throughout history, "late rice is prone to disasters, afraid of drought, afraid of insects, and afraid of cold waves," and that "late rice competing with early rice" is empty talk. Thus, a mass debate began. The center of the debate was: can late rice surpass early rice? How can it be surpassed? In essence, this was an ideological struggle between two roads in the countryside. The county party committee analyzed the excellent situation in the countryside at that time, enthusiastically supported the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the broad masses, boldly let go, mobilized the masses, relied on the majority of the masses, and led this great debate of ideological struggle. From indicators to measures, debate at all levels, and implement it down to each plot. In this way, the slogan "Double-Season Late Rice Competing with Early Rice" quickly turned into the practical action of the broad masses of the county.

From late June to early July, on the eve of the early rice harvest, a high tide of manure accumulation for late rice was set off throughout the county, whether in rural areas, towns, factories, or schools. More than 150,000 people were mobilized to fight for two weeks, accumulating an average of more than 260 dan of base fertilizer per mu of late rice fields. This fundamentally changed the past passive practice of "late rice does not need manure, all depends on autumn rain". People happily sang:

	Golden waves surge in the early rice fields,
	Ten thousand people harmonize in the harvest song;
	Break through the fertilizer barrier in one fell swoop,
	We must make late rice surpass early rice.

The movement of "Double-Season Late Rice Competing with Early Rice" was pushed to a climax wave after wave. Its momentum was fierce and unstoppable. In the tense struggle of rushing to harvest early rice and rush to transplant late rice, more than 260,000 people were mobilized throughout the county every day, divided into four groups, and adopted the "four-side" method of harvesting, applying base fertilizer, plowing and harrowing, and transplanting seedlings at the same time. With leadership and organization, they broke through the four major measures of "guaranteeing area, seizing the season, reasonable close planting, and improving quality", overfulfilling the transplanting area of double-season late rice, and completing the transplanting before the "Great Heat", more than ten days earlier than last year.

One step ahead, every step is proactive. After transplanting, each commune fully utilized the experience of increasing production year after year by planting ash in the ridged furrows of early rice, and generally planted ash in the ridged furrows once, which promoted rapid greening of the seedlings and early tillering. In field management, the county party committee summarized the advanced experience of Liling farmers in meticulous farming over the years, and carried out a movement to replenish missing seedlings, ensure full seedlings, rational irrigation, intertillage and weeding, rational topdressing, and eliminate drought and pests. More than 410,000 mu of double-season late rice in the county generally reached three intertillage, and more than 70% of the fields reached four intertillage; each intertillage was combined with topdressing, with an average of more than 150 dan per mu. This not only increased the number of intertillage and topdressing by one to two times compared with last year, but also improved the quality.

This year's bumper harvest of double-season late rice in Liling County was achieved by relying on the power of the People's Commune and overcoming the major drought that had not occurred in more than sixty years and the major pest infestation that had been rare in more than twenty years. This is a victory in the struggle against natural disasters, and also a victory achieved by opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale. When late rice transplanting began, drought appeared in some areas, and the drought developed rapidly. In less than half a month, 210,000 mu of late rice in the county were affected by drought. At that time, a small number of people with serious right-leaning ideas put forward arguments such as "it is not worth the loss to draw water to irrigate fields and transplant seedlings", and some cadres and masses also showed a mood of fear of difficulty and retreat. Just at this critical moment, the Party Central Committee put forward timely instructions to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale, which boosted morale and increased enthusiasm. The number of people fighting drought in the county increased sharply from more than 50,000 to more than 170,000. Everyone was eager to try and wanted to compete with the sky. The more severe the drought and the more difficult the conditions, the stronger the fighting spirit of the heroic people. At that time, the eight main leading cadres of the county party committee went to Huangtazui Commune, the most severely drought-stricken commune in the county, organized more than 3,200 people, and fought hard for two days and nights, digging tunnels through the mountains and opening a channel two meters deep, one meter wide, and seven li long, and then concentrated pumping water to irrigate, saving more than 10,000 mu of rice seedlings. Such moving deeds were found everywhere in the struggle against drought or pest control.

This year, in the production competition movement, new communist styles of you helping me and me helping you and mutual cooperation emerged everywhere. From labor, funds, water sources, materials, etc., large-scale collaboration and support were carried out according to the principle of equal value exchange. There were more than 66,000 laborers who supported each other throughout the county, and more than 7,800 waterwheels. Huangtazui Commune suffered the most from drought and had financial difficulties, and Taohua Commune lent them 20,000 yuan; in order to support Sifen Commune, which was affected by drought, Qingshuijiang Commune not only adjusted the water source, but also dispatched more than 60 waterwheels. Industrial and mining enterprises, cities, organs, and schools also formed a mass movement to support drought resistance.

    晚稻是怎样高产的
    中共醴陵县委第一书记　赵建德
    人民公社头一年，醴陵县的农业生产，在去年大跃进的基础上，又获得了晚稻超早稻的新胜利。
    “从群众中来，到群众中去。”党中央和毛主席这一亲切的教导，从今年“双季晚稻赛早稻”的运动中，我们又有了深切的体会。
    早稻收割前夕，广大农民群众怀着早稻丰收的兴奋心情，盘算着晚稻赛早稻的窍门。南桥公社花麦田大队的干部和群众，在总结今年早稻丰产经验，研究争取晚稻更大丰收的措施的时候，联想到去年有八十三亩双季晚稻，获得了平均亩产九百一十斤的高产事实。他们高兴地叫了起来：“这就是榜样！”他们总结出这些晚稻田高产的主要经验是：大暑节前插秧，深耕，施足底肥，合理密植和加强田间管理。大家还一致认为：今年有了人民公社，有去年大跃进的经验，双季晚稻超早稻是可能的。南桥公社党委根据这个大队群众的要求，一马当先，向全县发起“双季晚稻赛早稻”的倡议。这个倡议像燎原的星火，迅速燃遍全县。
    正在群众热情高涨的时候，党内外出现一小撮有严重右倾思想的人，他们给群众泼冷水，说什么有史以来“晚稻低产”、“晚稻多灾多难，怕旱、怕虫、怕寒潮”，说“晚稻赛早稻”是空喊。于是，一场全民性的大辩论开始了。辩论的中心是：晚稻能不能赛过早稻？怎样才能赛过？实质上这是农村两条道路的思想斗争。县委分析了当时农村的大好形势，热情地支持了广大群众的革命首创精神，大胆放手，发动群众，依靠了群众的大多数，领导了这场思想斗争的大论战。从指标到措施，层层辩论，落实到丘。这样，“双季晚稻赛早稻”的口号，很快地变成了全县广大群众的实际行动。
    6月下旬至7月上旬，在早稻收割前夕，全县境内无论是农村、城镇、工厂、学校，都掀起了为晚稻的积肥高潮，全县出动十五万多人奋战两星期，平均每亩晚稻田积基肥二百六十多担。从根本上改变了过去“晚稻不要粪，全靠秋雨喷”的消极作法。人们愉快唱着：
    满垅早稻荡金波，
    丰收歌子万人和；
    一举猛攻破肥关，
    定叫晚禾赛早禾。
    “双季晚稻赛早稻”的运动一浪高一浪地推向高潮。其势之猛，锐不可当。在抢收早稻、抢插晚稻的紧张斗争中，全县每天出动二十六万多人，兵分四路，采取边收割、边下底肥、边犁耙、边插秧的“四边”办法，有领导有组织地闯过了“保证面积、抢住季节、合理密植、提高质量”的四大措施，超额完成了双季晚稻的插秧面积，而且抢在“大暑”前插完秧，较去年提前十多天。
    一着领先，步步主动。插秧后，各公社充分运用了早稻点安兜灰连年增产的经验，普遍插了一次安兜灰，促使秧苗转青快，分蘖早。在田间管理上，县委总结了醴陵农民历年来精耕细作的先进经验，开展了补兜全苗、合理浇灌、中耕除草、合理追肥和消灭干旱与病虫害的运动。全县四十一万多亩双季晚稻，普遍达到中耕三次，70％以上的田中耕达到四次；每次中耕并结合下追肥，每亩平均在一百五十担以上。这不仅比去年增加了一至二次的中耕追肥，而且质量也有提高。
    今年醴陵县的双季晚稻大丰收，是依仗了人民公社的威力，战胜了六十多年来未有的大干旱和二十多年来少见的大虫害取得的。这是向自然灾害作斗争的胜利，也是反右倾、鼓干劲所取得的胜利。晚稻插秧开始，部分地区就出现了干旱，旱象发展很快，不到半个月，全县有二十一万亩晚稻受旱。当时，一小部分右倾思想严重的人提出“车水灌田插秧，得不偿失”等论调，部分干部和群众中也出现了畏难、退缩的情绪。正当这个紧要关头，党中央及时提出了反右倾、鼓干劲的指示，人心振奋，干劲倍增。全县抗旱人数由五万多人，激增到十七万多人。个个磨拳擦掌，要与天公比高低。干旱越严重，条件越困难，英雄人民的斗志越坚强。当时县委的八个主要领导干部都到了全县干旱最严重的黄獭嘴公社，组织了三千二百多人，苦战两昼夜，穿山凿洞，打开一条二米深、一米宽、长达七里路的渠道，然后集中抽水机提水浇灌，救活了一万多亩禾苗。这种动人的事迹，无论在抗旱或治虫斗争到处都有。
    今年在生产竞赛运动中，你帮我，我帮你，互相协作的共产主义新风格到处涌现。从劳力、资金、水源、物资等等方面，按等价交换原则，进行了大协作大支援。全县相互支援的劳力就有六万六千多个，水车七千八百多架。黄獭嘴公社受旱最大，资金困难，桃花公社借给他们两万元；清水江公社为了支援受旱的泗汾公社，不但调剂了水源，还抽出六十多架水车。工矿、城市、机关、学校支援抗旱，也形成了群众运动。
