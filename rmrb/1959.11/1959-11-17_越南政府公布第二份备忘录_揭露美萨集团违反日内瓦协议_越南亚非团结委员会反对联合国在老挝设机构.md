Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 16th: Phan Hien, Director of the Press Department of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry, announced here this afternoon at a press conference the second memorandum of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding the serious violations of the Geneva Agreements on Laos by the U.S. Government and the Kingdom of Laos, threatening peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. The memorandum is divided into four parts.

In the first part of the memorandum, it reveals the facts that the U.S. government openly transported large quantities of new weapons and military personnel into Laos while instigating the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military aggressive bloc to prepare for armed intervention in Laos.

The second part of the memorandum further exposes the U.S. government's conspiracy to slander the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for "interfering" in Laotian internal affairs in order to conceal the truth of its intervention in Laos and deceive public opinion. The memorandum points out: "The contradictory arguments of the United States and the Sananikone government only expose their own despicable lies."

The third part of the memorandum points out that the U.S. government and the Phoui Sananikone government submitted the Laotian issue to the United Nations Security Council with the aim of using the United Nations flag to cover up the U.S. imperialist plot to further interfere in Laos, thereby continuing to expand the civil war in Laos.

Finally, the memorandum reiterates the solemn position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding the solution of the Laotian issue, which is to strictly and fully implement the Geneva Agreements on Laos.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 15th: According to local newspapers, the Vietnam Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Committee issued a statement on the 14th, opposing the U.S. imperialist plot to establish a permanent United Nations institution in Laos.

The statement addressed the activities of the United Nations "Laos Situation Investigation Team" and pointed out that the facts have proven that the slanderous argument of "the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's aggression against Laos" is completely unfounded. However, in order to intensify its interference in Laos and turn Laos into a U.S. military base, U.S. imperialism is plotting to establish a permanent United Nations institution in Laos. The "visit" to Laos by UN Secretary-General Hammarskjold this time may help the U.S. interventionists realize the above-mentioned conspiracy.

The statement emphasized, "The Vietnam Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Committee strongly opposes U.S. imperialism's attempt to establish a permanent United Nations institution in Laos, using the United Nations flag to continue its illegal interference in Laos, and actively intensifying its conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Agreements in collusion with the Sananikone government."

The statement said, "As a signatory to the Geneva Agreements on Laos, the Vietnamese people demand respect for and thorough implementation of this agreement and the Vientiane Agreement, demand the immediate restoration of the activities of the International Control Commission in Laos, and the restoration of freedom to Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front."

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, November 14th: A commentator for the Mongolian Telegraph Agency published a commentary on the 13th regarding the Laotian situation, pointing out that after the provocative activities of the United Nations "Investigation Team on the Laotian Situation" failed, the enemies of world peace and tranquility are still not reconciled. Now, they are continuing to seek excuses to interfere in Laos. The commentary said that the disgraceful mission of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjold's trip to Laos should be viewed from this perspective.

The commentary said that Hammarskjold has openly acted as an accomplice of the imperialist countries and an executor of their shameless dealings. His visit to Laos is a violation of the UN Charter. The Mongolian public cannot but regard his arrival in Vientiane as an attempt to completely tear up the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreement.

    越南政府公布第二份备忘录
    揭露美萨集团违反日内瓦协议
    越南亚非团结委员会反对联合国在老挝设机构
    新华社河内16日电　越南外交部新闻司司长潘贤今天下午在这里举行的记者招待会上，公布了越南民主共和国政府关于美国政府和老挝王国政府严重违反关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议、威胁印度支那和东南亚和平的第二份备忘录。备忘录共分四部分。
    备忘录在第一部分中揭露了美国政府公开把大量新武器和军事人员运入老挝、同时唆使东南亚条约组织军事侵略集团准备对老挝进行武装干涉的种种事实。
    备忘录的第二部分进一步揭露了美国政府为了掩饰它干涉老挝的真相和欺骗舆论，无耻地诬蔑越南民主共和国政府“干涉”老挝内政的阴谋。备忘录指出：“美国和萨纳尼空政府充满矛盾的论调，只是暴露了自己卑鄙的谎言。”
    备忘录的第三部分指出，美国政府和培·萨纳尼空政府把老挝问题提交联合国安全理事会，其目的是企图利用联合国的旗帜来掩饰美帝国主义阴谋对老挝的进一步干涉，从而继续扩大老挝的内战。
    备忘录最后再次宣布越南民主共和国关于解决老挝问题的严正立场，就是严格而充分地履行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议。
    新华社河内15日电　据此间报纸报道，越南亚非人民团结委员会14日发表声明，反对美帝国主义阴谋在老挝设立联合国常设机构。
    声明谈到联合国“老挝局势调查小组委员会”的活动，并指出，事实证明所谓“越南民主共和国侵略老挝”的诬蔑论调是完全没有根据的。但是，美帝国主义为了加紧干涉老挝，把老挝变成美国的军事基地，阴谋在老挝设立联合国常设机构。联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德这次到老挝的“访问”，有可能帮助美国干涉者实现上述阴谋。
    声明强调说，“越南亚非人民团结委员会强烈反对美帝国主义企图在老挝设立联合国常设机构，打着联合国的旗帜，继续对老挝进行非法的干涉，并同萨纳尼空政府积极加紧破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋。”
    声明说，“作为签订关于老挝的日内瓦协议的一方，越南人民要求尊重和彻底履行这个协议和万象协议，要求立即恢复老挝国际委员会的活动和恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其它领导人的自由。”
    据新华社乌兰巴托14日电　蒙古通讯社评论员13日就老挝局势发表评论指出，在联合国“调查老挝局势小组委员会”的挑衅活动失败以后，世界和平与安宁的敌人仍不死心。现在，他们正在继续寻求干涉老挝的借口。评论说，正是应该从这个角度来看联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德老挝之行的不光彩使命的目的。
    评论说，哈马舍尔德这次公开地充当了帝国主义国家的帮凶和它们的无耻勾当的执行人。他访问老挝是违背联合国宪章的。蒙古公众不能不把他到达万象看作是企图彻底撕毁日内瓦协议和万象协议。
