Pingxiang, November 21st (This newspaper dispatch) - Small coal mines in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, produced 600,000 tons of raw coal and 25,000 tons of coking coal in nine and a half months this year, exceeding the annual coal production plan by 17% ahead of schedule. The total output increased by 40% compared to the actual coal output for the entire year of last year. The quality fully met the standards stipulated by the state, and over 90,000 tons of raw coal were transferred to other areas.
    Pingxiang is a famous coal base in the south of the Yangtze River. Among the county's twenty-eight people's communes, twenty-four communes have small coal mines. Under the leadership of the county party committee, these coal mines have undergone technological transformation, changing inclined shafts and "morning glory" (朝天井) shafts into horizontal tunnels; changing bamboo tube water pumping to wooden pump water pumping, making it difficult for rainwater to enter, and even if it flows into the well, it can be quickly pumped out. This has played a significant role in ensuring normal production.
    While transforming the mines, the broad masses of workers vigorously carried out innovations in production tools and operating methods. In the past nine months, fifty-five major innovation projects have been realized. In the past, at the wellhead of the first district of Yuejin Coal Mine, it took eighteen people per shift to manage the coal coming out of the buckets, and the circulation of coal buckets was very slow. Later, the workers created a three-wheeled automatic coal dumping chute, which only required one person to operate. This saved a total of fifty-one laborers for three shifts a day and accelerated the turnover of coal buckets. With the development of technological innovation, small coal mines have gradually moved from indigenous production to small-scale mechanized production.

    萍乡县小煤窑加快技术改造  九个半月已产原煤六十万吨
    本报萍乡21日电　江西萍乡县小煤窑今年以九个半月时间，生产原煤六十万吨，焦煤二万五千吨，超额17％提前完成了今年全年产煤计划。总产量比去年全年实际煤产量增长40％，质量完全合乎国家规定的标准，并且完成外调原煤九万余吨。
    萍乡是江南著名的煤炭基地，全县二十八个人民公社中，有二十四个公社都有小煤窑。这批煤窑在县委领导下，进行了技术改造，改斜井和朝天井为平窿；改竹筒抽水为木泵抽水，使雨水不易侵入，即使流入井内，也能很快抽干。这对保证正常生产起了显著作用。
    在改造矿井的同时，广大职工大力进行了生产工具和操作方法的革新。今年九个多月以来，已实现了五十五件重大的革新项目。跃进煤矿一区井口过去煤桶的煤倒下去，一班需要十八个人抓，煤桶循环很慢；后来工人创造了一个三轮自动倒煤溜斗，只要一个人操作即可，一天三班共节约劳动力五十一个，并且加快了煤桶周转。随着技术革新的发展，小煤窑也逐步由土法生产走上了小洋群生产。
