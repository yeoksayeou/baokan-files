Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch from Stanleyville: Demanding immediate independence, Congolese people clashed on a large scale with the Belgian colonial authorities' military police in the Stanleyville area on the evening of October 30th. As of the afternoon of the 31st, the conflict had spread from the right bank of the Congo River in Stanleyville to the left bank.

According to the Belgian official communique alone, twenty-four Africans were shot dead by military police during the conflict, and at least thirty were injured.

Reports say that on the evening of the 30th, the Belgian colonial authorities sent police to attempt to sabotage an ongoing congress of the Congolese National Movement and arrest its leader, Lumumba. At the time, the Congolese people who were listening to Lumumba's speech were filled with passion and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the police using stones, bows and arrows, and spears. Although the police released tear gas and opened fire, the heroic Congolese people remained gathered and the struggle continued late into the night.

Some reports say that the Belgian colonial authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Lumumba on charges of "inciting riots," but he has not been found.

At the same time, on the evening of the 30th, African prisoners in the Stanleyville prison refused to return to their cells after "exercise time" and held a demonstration. Police used tear gas to disperse them.

Following these events, the Belgian colonial authorities hurriedly declared a state of "insurrection" and imposed a curfew. However, the enraged Congolese people continued to hold demonstrations in various parts of the town. On the morning of the 31st, demonstrations also broke out on the left bank of the Congo River. The situation in this area remains tense.

Some reports say that in order to continue suppressing the Congolese people's anti-colonial struggle for immediate independence, the Belgian colonial authorities have transferred an armored force equipped with heavy machine guns, light artillery and other weapons from Gombari, northeast of Stanleyville, on the 31st, and have also airlifted two infantry companies from Luluabourg, 480 miles away, to the city. Some of these troops guarded the area where 3,000 Europeans live in the city, and some have entered the area inhabited by 100,000 Africans. The armed conflict in Stanleyville shows that the large-scale struggle against colonial rule that began in the Congo in early January this year is on the rise.

Since January of this year, in order to maintain its colonial rule, the Belgian authorities have taken bloody suppression measures on the one hand and played political deception tricks on the other. On October 16, the Belgian Minister for Congolese and Ruanda-Urundi Affairs, De Schuriever, announced a so-called deceptive plan to allow the Congolese people to achieve "independence in stages." According to this plan, the Congo will hold so-called "elections" for municipal councils in December this year. This obviously deceptive plan has been resolutely opposed by various Congolese nationalist parties, including the Abako Party and the Congolese National Movement.

The congress of the Congolese National Movement, which was held in Stanleyville in the middle of last week, also passed a resolution formally demanding that the Congo be declared independent immediately, that the elections be postponed, and that negotiations be conducted on an equal footing.

### 刚果又爆发人民大示威  群众同军警展开搏斗　冲突扩大到刚果河两岸

    刚果又爆发人民大示威
    群众同军警展开搏斗　冲突扩大到刚果河两岸
    新华社1日讯　斯坦利维尔消息：要求立即独立的刚果人民10月30日晚在斯坦利维尔地区同比利时殖民当局的军警发生大规模冲突。截至31日下午，冲突已经从斯坦利维尔的刚果河右岸地区扩大到左岸。
    仅据比利时官方发表的公报，在冲突时被军警开枪打死的非洲人就有二十四名，受伤的至少有三十人。
    消息说，比利时殖民当局在30日晚派出警察，企图武装破坏刚果民族运动党正在举行的大会并逮捕这个政党的领袖卢蒙巴。当时，正在听取卢蒙巴演说的刚果人群情激昂，用石头、弓箭和长矛同警察展开了搏斗。虽然警察放了催泪弹，并且开了枪，英勇的刚果人仍聚集不散，斗争一直继续到深夜。
    有消息说，比利时殖民当局已经发出逮捕卢蒙巴的拘票，罪名是“挑唆暴动”，可是一直没有找到他。
    与此同时，30日晚上，在斯坦利维尔监狱里的非洲籍犯人在“放风”后拒绝回到牢房去，并且举行示威。警察施放催泪弹后才把他们驱散。
    在这些事件发生后，比利时殖民当局慌忙宣布处于“暴乱状态”，并且实施宵禁。可是，被激怒了的刚果人在这个城镇各地区仍不断举行示威。31日上午，在刚果河左岸也爆发了示威行动。这个地区的局势仍然紧张。
    有消息说，为了继续镇压刚果人民要求立即独立的反殖民主义的斗争，比利时殖民当局在31日已从斯坦利维尔东北的贡巴里调来一支拥有重机枪、轻炮等武器的装甲兵部队，还向这个城市空投了从四百八十英里以外的路路阿堡调来的两个步兵连。这些部队中的一部分守卫了这座城市中三千名欧洲人居住的地区，一部分已经进入有十万名非洲人居住的地区。斯坦利维尔爆发的这一武装冲突表明自今年1月初在刚果展开的大规模反对殖民统治的斗争正在高涨。
    今年1月以来，比利时当局为了维持它的殖民统治，一方面采取血腥镇压措施，一方面玩弄政治欺骗手法。10月16日，比利时的刚果和卢安达一乌迪隆事务大臣德舒里弗曾宣布了一个所谓让刚果人民“分阶段独立”的欺骗性计划。根据这个计划，刚果将在今年12月举行所谓市镇议会的“选举”。这个欺骗性显而易见的计划遭到了刚果各民族主义政党，其中包括阿巴科党和刚果民族运动党的坚决反对。
    上星期中在斯坦利维尔召开的刚果民族运动党的代表大会又通过决议，正式要求立即宣布刚果独立，延期举行选举，在平等的基础上进行谈判。
