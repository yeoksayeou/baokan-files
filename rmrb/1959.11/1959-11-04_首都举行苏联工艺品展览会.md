Antonov said that we are very happy to celebrate the cultural exchanges between our two peoples, which are developing year by year. The Soviet people closely watch the smooth development of China's cultural construction and are delighted by the achievements made by Chinese friends in this regard. He finally congratulated the further development of cultural exchanges between the Soviet and Chinese peoples advancing on the road to socialism and communism.
