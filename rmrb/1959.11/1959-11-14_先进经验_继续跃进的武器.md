    Advanced Experience - A Weapon for Continued Great Leap Forward
    At present, all sectors of the national economy are exerting great efforts to strive to overfulfill this year's national plan, and the trend of a continued Great Leap Forward next year has been clearly determined. Under these circumstances, the demand for coal from all quarters will obviously increase correspondingly. This requires all employees on the coal industry front to make more brilliant achievements in production and construction, not only to overfulfill this year's production and construction tasks to a greater extent, but also to fully prepare to ensure a continued Great Leap Forward next year.
    To accomplish this task, we have a sharp weapon, which is to learn and apply the advanced experience in coal production and construction. At the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Coal Industry systematically summarized the advanced experiences that have emerged over the years, especially during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and summarized them into thirty-six items. At this National Conference of Heroes and Heroines for the Exchange of Advanced Experience in the Coal System, experiences in various aspects of production and construction were further widely exchanged, increasing the original thirty-six items to one hundred items. At this meeting, representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers in the coal industry system adopted a joint initiative and twelve initiatives by specialty and type of work. These initiatives clearly put forward the key points for promoting advanced experience. Undoubtedly, this will greatly promote the production and construction of the coal industry.
    According to the development direction of the coal industry and the key links in the current coal production and construction, among the various advanced experiences, special emphasis should be placed on promoting the experience of the four-shift, eight-hour cross-operation system, improving small coal mines, hydraulic coal mining, and advanced experiences in some important processes.
    The four-shift, eight-hour cross-operation system is a revolution in the organization of coal mine production. According to the situation of several mines that have already implemented it, production efficiency has generally increased by 15%-35%, and the cost of raw coal has decreased by 10%-15%. We hope that all coal mines will quickly and universally implement this reform, so that the output of coal can be greatly increased and the cost greatly reduced in a short period of time without increasing manpower and equipment; and that miners can always maintain vigorous energy.
    The small coal mines that developed during the Great Leap Forward last year are a vital force on the coal industry front. This year, the production tasks undertaken by small coal mines nationwide account for one-seventh of the country's total coal output. Further improving the management and technical levels of these small coal mines will play an important role in increasing the production of the entire coal industry. The Shanjinjia Coal Mine in Anhui, which is introduced in this newspaper today, is only one of the better-run small coal mines. We hope that all localities will continue to create and summarize experiences in developing and improving small coal mines, so that the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" can shine more brightly on the coal industry front.
    Hydraulic coal mining is an advanced production technology in the world and is the direction of technological development in the coal industry. However, some people believe that hydraulic coal mining technology is relatively complicated and difficult to master; some emphasize objective conditions and feel that hydraulic coal mining is unattainable. In fact, as long as we rely on the masses and break down superstitions, the technical barriers can be broken through. The Bijagang hydraulic coal mine in Huainan was originally just an ordinary mine, but they successfully implemented hydraulic coal mining, which is a very powerful illustration.
    Other advanced experiences, such as safe transport of electric chutes in coal mining, rapid recovery of props, automation of drilling rigs in geological exploration, and wooden elimination machines in coal preparation, are all advanced experiences in some current weak links or key processes. Promoting these experiences is of great significance for comprehensively improving coal output, quality, and reducing costs.
    We hope that the representatives of advanced producers in the coal industry system who attended this National Conference of Heroes and Heroines will humbly learn from these advanced experiences, bring these advanced experiences back, unite the masses, play a key role, and quickly apply them in practice. At the same time, we also hope that all enterprises in the coal industry system will strengthen the organizational leadership of promoting advanced experience, determine projects, determine locations, determine special personnel, and determine progress. The promotion methods that have been effective in the first half of the year, such as combining mobile performances and on-site meetings, can continue to be studied and used. Since the various links in coal mine production and construction are interconnected, on the one hand, it is necessary to focus on key points during the promotion, and on the other hand, it is necessary to pay attention to new weak links that appear during the promotion process, and pay attention to creating and promoting other advanced experiences, so as to ensure comprehensive, continuous, and high production.
    Heroes have returned to their respective enterprises with greater enthusiasm and richer experience. Let us take this opportunity to wish new achievements and new victories on the coal industry front!

### 先进经验——继续跃进的武器

    先进经验——继续跃进的武器
    目前国民经济各个部门都在鼓足干劲，力争超额完成今年的国家计划，明年继续跃进的趋势也已确定无疑。在这种情况下，各方面对煤炭的需要量显然将相应地大量增加。这就要求煤炭工业战线上的全体职工，在生产建设中做出更加辉煌的成绩，既要更多地超额完成今年的生产建设任务，又要充分进行准备，以保证明年的继续跃进。
    完成这个任务，我们有一支锋利的武器，这就是学习和运用煤炭生产建设中的先进经验。今年年初，煤炭工业部对历年来、特别是1958年大跃进中出现的先进经验，进行了系统的总结，归纳为三十六项。这一次在全国群英会煤炭系统先进经验交流会议上，又进一步广泛交流了生产建设各方面的经验，把原来的三十六项增加到一百项。在这个会议上，煤炭工业系统的先进集体和先进生产者的代表们，通过了联合倡议书和分专业、分工种的十二项倡议书，在这些倡议书中，都明确地提出了推广先进经验的重点。无疑地，这将对煤炭工业的生产建设起到极大的推动作用。
    根据煤炭工业的发展方针和当前煤炭生产建设中的关键环节，在各项先进经验中，应该特别着重推行四（班）、八（小时）交叉作业制的经验、提高小型煤矿的经验、水力采煤的经验以及一些重要工序上的先进经验。
    四、八交叉作业制是煤矿生产组织上的一项革命。据已推行的几个矿的情况来看，生产效率一般都提高了15％—35％，原煤成本降低10％—15％。我们希望各个煤矿迅速地普遍地推行这项改革，以便在不增加人力、设备的条件下，使煤炭的产量在短期内大大提高，成本大大降低；并且使矿工们始终保持充沛的精力。
    在去年大跃进中发展起来的小型煤矿，是煤炭工业战线上的一支生力军。今年全国小型煤矿担负的生产任务，占全国煤炭总产量的七分之一。进一步提高这些小型煤矿的管理水平和技术水平，将对整个煤炭工业的增产发生重要的作用。今天本报介绍的安徽山金家煤矿，只是办得比较好的小型煤矿之一。我们希望各地继续创造和总结发展与提高小型煤矿的经验，使党的“两条腿走路”的方针在煤炭工业战线上发出更加灿烂的光辉。
    水力采煤是世界上一项先进的生产技术，是煤炭工业技术发展的方向。但是，有些人认为水力采煤技术比较复杂，难于掌握；有的强调客观条件，觉得水力采煤高不可攀。其实，只要依靠群众，破除迷信，技术关是可以突破的。淮南毕家岗的水力采煤矿井原来只是一个普通的矿井，但是他们成功地实现了水力采煤，就是一个很有力的说明。
    其他如采煤中的电溜子安全运输，快速回收支柱，地质勘探中的钻机自动化，选煤中的木质淘汰机等，都是当前一些薄弱环节或关键工序上的先进经验，推广这些经验对全面地提高煤炭的产量、质量、降低成本，都有很重要的意义。
    我们希望出席这次全国群英会的煤炭工业系统的先进生产者代表们，虚心地学习这些先进经验，把这些先进经验带回去，团结群众，发挥骨干作用，迅速地在实践中运用起来。同时，我们也希望煤炭工业系统的各个企业加强对推广先进经验的组织领导工作，确定项目、确定地点、确定专人、确定进度，在上半年行之有效的巡回表演和现场会议相结合等推广方法，可以继续研究使用。由于煤矿生产建设中的各个环节是互相联系的，因此，在推行中，一方面要抓住重点，一方面又要随时注意在推行过程中出现的新的薄弱环节，注意创造和推广其它的先进经验，这样，才能保证全面的持续的高产。
    英雄们带着更大的干劲和更丰富的经验回到各企业去了，让我们在此预祝煤炭工业战线上的新的成就、新的胜利！
