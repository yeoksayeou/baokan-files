    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou Dispatch—Workers in Guangdong Province's steel rolling, cement, and timber production sectors are doing everything possible to increase production of more and better materials to support the large-scale water conservancy construction this winter and next spring.
    Guangdong Province's water conservancy construction scale will be grand this winter and next spring, and the quantity of various materials needed is also very large, especially large-scale water conservancy projects require steel, cement, timber, and other materials. In response to this situation, relevant departments have decided to take measures to vigorously increase production.
    At present, steel rolling units in Guangzhou City have decided to increase steel production by 10% on the basis of ensuring the completion of the steel rolling target assigned by the city. The increased steel will be used first to support water conservancy construction.
    Cement workers have put forward a guarantee to increase cement production, and 20,000 tons of cement will be used to support rural water conservancy construction in November and December. Workers at the Guangzhou Cement Plant are trying to realize the plan to increase cement production. Workers in the calcination workshop discovered that the cement kiln was burning red and immediately took measures to repair the kiln skin, so that the kiln could be safely produced, saving the loss of 1,500 tons of cement that would be reduced by shutting down the kiln for repairs. Workers in the transportation workshop have repeatedly increased the transportation volume of mixed materials in recent days, which has greatly supported other processes. Thanks to the efforts of the workers, they overproduced 159 tons of cement more than planned in the first ten days of November alone.
    The timber production department has also decided to give priority to supplying timber to rural areas. More than 170,000 workers on the timber production front are taking measures to impound water in sections of mountain streams and small rivers that are dry and make it difficult to transport timber, and carry out herding and floating timber downstream.

    增产更多更好的钢材木材和水泥
    广东职工大力支援水利建设
    据新华社广州电　广东省轧钢、水泥、木材生产部门的职工千方百计增产更多更好的材料，来支援今冬明春的大规模水利建设。
    广东省今冬明春水利建设规模宏大，需要各种材料的数量也很大，尤其是大型水利工程需要钢材、水泥、木材等。针对这个情况，有关部门决定采取措施，大力增产。
    现在，广州市各轧钢单位已决定在保证完成市下达的轧钢指标的基础上，再增产钢材10％。增产的钢材将首先用来支援水利建设。
    水泥工人们提出了增产水泥的保证，11、12两月将有两万吨水泥用来支援农村水利建设。广州水泥厂职工正在设法实现增产水泥的计划。烧成车间的工人发现水泥窑烧红，马上采取措施补挂窑皮，使这个窑能够安全生产，挽救了停窑修理要减少一千五百吨水泥的损失。运输车间的工人连日来把混合材的运输量一再提高，大大支援了其他工序。在工人们的努力下，仅11月头十天就超过计划多产了一百五十九吨水泥。
    木材生产部门也决定向农村优先供应木材。木材生产战线的十七万多名职工正针对山溪小河水枯运输木材困难的情况，采取分段拦河贮水，进行赶羊流送。
