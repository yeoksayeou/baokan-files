Low Education Can't Stop a Burning Heart
—An Account of Wang Quanlu's Innovation at the Guilin Construction Company's Lumber Mill

Wang Quanlu is a carpenter at the Guilin City Construction Company's Lumber Mill in Guangxi. Like many working people, he had a very painful experience in the old society. He herded cattle for landlords from a young age, and at fourteen, he left his hometown to become an apprentice in a woodworking factory. At that time, his labor for a year could only buy two hundred and eighty catties of sweet potatoes, and after three years as an apprentice, he only received sixty strings of cash, and even had to bring his own tools. After suffering for three years, he didn't learn any skills. After three years, he still had to assist his master for another year. After only half a year of helping, he became seriously ill. The cruel boss, seeing that he couldn't work, threw him under a large tree in a mountain village while he was unconscious. He lay under the tree for two days before barely managing to crawl up. He begged his way home. Before he could even stay home for a month, the Kuomintang came to conscript soldiers, forcing him to flee to Guilin to do odd jobs.

These painful experiences left a deep mark on Wang Quanlu's heart. After liberation, under the education of the Party, and through a series of political movements such as the democratic reform and the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, he quickly raised his class consciousness, understood the root causes of his past suffering, and understood the responsibility of being a worker.

The nation's socialist construction cause was advancing by leaps and bounds, and the lumber processing tasks were getting bigger year by year. However, the lumber mill where he worked was still using manual operations, which were inefficient and couldn't keep up with the needs. At that time, he thought that only by carrying out technological innovation and promoting and creating advanced tools could this problem be solved. He told the Party organization about this idea, and the Party organization encouraged him to be bold and do it. Under the leadership and support of the Party and with the assistance of his comrades, before 1956, he had created and improved thirty-seven kinds of tools, which enabled their factory's woodworking to jump from the manual operations handed down by the ancestor of carpenters, Lu Ban, to semi-mechanization or mechanization. In 1957, he improved eight kinds of tools. In 1958, he created and reformed eighteen kinds of tools. In the first quarter of this year, under the encouragement of the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the factory's production had a greater leap forward. In order to catch up with the needs of greater production development, they created and reformed seven kinds of tools such as automatic wire drawing machines, cut-off machines, four-sided planers, door and window angle openers, and tenon planing machines. These advanced tools generally improve work efficiency by more than ten times. For example, the tenon planing machine used for planing doors and windows can increase efficiency by 42 times, and the automatic planing machine can increase it by more than 30 times. In the past, a fourth-grade worker could only plane out a maximum of twenty-odd square feet of flooring with great effort in a day; after using the planing machine, an apprentice who had just entered the factory for a month or two could plane out more than two hundred square feet of boards in a day; the flatness and smoothness of the boards were also far better than the quality of those made by hand in the past. After using these advanced tools, according to preliminary estimates, a minimum of 51,000 labor days can be saved each year. Now the whole factory has more than eighty kinds of advanced tools and semi-native and semi-foreign machines. Except for the original seven-horsepower motor and a circular saw, all of them were made by them through self-reliance and self-manufacturing. Now the production efficiency of one worker is equal to that of more than thirty people in the past when using manual operations.

In August of this year, the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party gave him great encouragement. At this time, the Guilin Municipal Party Committee issued a call for learning from Wang Quanlu. Such lofty honor made him feel that his responsibility was even greater, and he needed to make greater efforts in production. Therefore, in August and September, he and the masses worked together to manufacture and modify ten machines, improve operations, and increase work efficiency by two to more than twenty times, ensuring the construction of key projects.

In September of this year, during the process of modifying and trial-producing these machines, his left eye was scratched by iron filings, and soon his right eye was stung red by the electric welding light. The leaders and comrades advised him to rest, but he felt that these small pains were nothing compared to the disasters and sufferings he had suffered in the old society. Therefore, he disregarded everything and continued to fight day and night with his comrades.

Carrying out technical innovation was not without difficulties for him, but he deeply realized that as long as he listened to the Party's words and earnestly followed the Party's instructions, he could overcome all difficulties and achieve success immediately.

The first difficulty he encountered was his low level of education. He only had a primary school education, had not attended a technical school, and found writing and arithmetic very difficult, and drawing was even more difficult. For example, when developing the automatic planing machine, he had to draw a diagram first. The plan view was easy to handle, but he couldn't draw the side view no matter what. He remembered that the Party had instructed that to carry out technical innovation, one must think boldly, study diligently, and try tenaciously, so his confidence in overcoming difficulties became even greater. He thought while walking, thought while eating, and thought all the time. One night, when he was holding the model under the light, turning it over and over, and thinking hard, he saw the shadow of the model under the light. This suddenly enlightened him, so he used the method of light projection to draw the side view. After the diagram was drawn, he had to go to sand casting; to do sand casting, he had to make a model. There were no sand casting workers in the factory, and he didn't know how to do it himself, so he had to go to other factories to learn. In this way, he learned while doing and spent a week to complete it. Although sand casting was successful, he still needed to turn and plane parts to make the machine, and to process them, he needed drawings. Without drawings, he stood next to the lathe and explained to the lathe operator, who turned the parts according to what he said. After several months of hard thinking, hard studying, and hard trying, he finally made the planing machine.

In addition to his low level of education and technical difficulties, another difficulty he encountered was the lack of raw materials, mainly the shortage of steel. He knew that the country was currently engaged in large-scale construction, and the demand for steel was too great, and production could not keep up with the demand for a while, so he never asked the leaders for materials every time he carried out innovation. He closely followed the Party's instructions of starting with indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and moving from indigenous to foreign methods, and tried his best to find substitutes in innovation and creation to save steel. For example, when developing the edge planing machine and the multi-head drilling machine, most of the parts were made of wood instead of steel.

In technical innovation, he not only improved the tools in his own workshop, but also considered other workshops. He knew that if one workshop in a factory could not keep up with production, it would affect other workshops and the entire factory. Since innovation was not for himself but for everyone and for socialist construction, he should consider the overall situation. Therefore, he often helped other workshops study and improve and create tools. In order to help other workshops with an invention, he often fought through the night. He never cared about rewards or conditions in his work. Because he often worked overtime and made great achievements, the factory wanted to reward him, but he firmly refused. He said: I am working for the construction of socialism, not for capitalists, why should I receive extra rewards?

    文化低挡不住心头热
    ——记桂林建筑公司木材加工厂王全禄的革新事迹
    王全禄是广西桂林市建筑公司木材加工厂的木工。他和许多劳动人民一样，在旧社会有着非常痛苦的遭遇。他从小就给地主放牛，十四岁远离家乡，到一家木工厂去当学徒。那时，他一年劳动的代价只能买二百八十斤红薯，当三年学徒只得到六十吊铜钱，连工具都要自己带。苦熬了三年，什么技术也没有学到。三年过去了，还要帮师一年。帮师才半年多，他就得了重病。残酷的老板见他干不了活，便趁他病昏时，把他丢在一个山村的大树下。他在树下躺了两天，才勉强挣扎爬起来。沿途要饭走回家。回家还没住上一个月，国民党又来抓壮丁，迫得他只好逃到桂林去做零工。
    这些痛苦的遭遇在王全禄的心里留下了深刻的烙印。解放后，在党的教育下，经过民主改革、三反五反等一系列的政治运动，使他很快提高了阶级觉悟，懂得了过去受苦的根源，懂得了做一个工人的责任。
    国家的社会主义建设事业一日千里地突飞猛进，木材加工任务一年比一年大，而他所在的木材加工厂，仍是用手工操作，效率低，赶不上需要。当时他就想，只有进行技术革新，推广和创造先进工具，才能解决这个问题。他把这个想法告诉了党组织，党组织鼓励他大胆去干。在党的领导支持和同志们的协助下，1956年以前，他就先后创造和改进了三十七种工具，使他们厂的木工活由鲁班祖师传下来的那一套手工操作跃进到半机械化或机械化。1957年改进了八种工具。1958年又创造和改革了十八种工具。今年第一季度，在党的八届六中全会精神的鼓舞下，厂的生产有了更大的跃进，为了赶上生产更大发展的需要，他们又创造改革了自动拉线机、断料机、四用刨床、门窗开角机、刨榫机等七种工具，这些先进工具一般都提高工作效率十倍以上。如刨门窗用的刨榫机，效率可提高四十二倍、自动刨板机提高三十倍以上。过去一个四级工，一天费老大劲最多也只能刨出二十几平方楼板；使用刨板机后，一个刚进厂个把月的学徒，一天就能刨出二百多方板子；板子的平整光滑程度，也远比过去手工做的质量好。使用这些先进工具以后，按初步估算，每年最低可以节省五万一千多个劳动日。现在全厂共有八十多种先进工具和半土半洋的机器，除了原有的一台七马力的电动机和一部圆锯以外，全是他们自力更生、自己制造的。现在一个工人的生产效率就等于过去手工操作时三十多人的。
    今年8月，党的八届八中全会的公报和决议，给了他极大的鼓舞。这时，桂林市委又发出了关于学习王全禄的号召。这样崇高的荣誉，使他感到自己的责任更加重大了，需要在生产中作出更大的努力。于是，8、9月份，他便和群众一道，针对厂内当时的生产关键，制造和改装了十部机器，改进了操作，工作效率提高了二倍以至二十多倍，保证了重点工程的施工。
    今年9月，在改装和试制这些机器过程中，他的左眼被铁屑擦伤了，不久右眼又被电焊光刺得通红。领导上和同志们劝他休息，可是他觉得这一点点病痛比起在旧社会所受的灾难痛苦，太算不了什么了。因此，他不顾一切地继续和同志们一道，日夜奋战。
    大搞技术革新，对他来说不是没有困难的，但是他深刻体会到只要听党的话，认真按照党的指示去做，就能排除万难，马到成功。
    他首先碰到的困难就是文化水平低。只有高小程度，又没有进过技术学校，写算都很费力，绘图就更感困难。如在搞自动刨板机的时候，必须先绘图，平面图还好办，侧面图却怎样也画不成。他想起了党曾指示过，要搞技术革新就要大胆地想、刻苦地学、顽强地试，于是他克服困难的信心就更大了。他走路也在想，吃饭也在想，无时不在想。有一天晚上，当他在灯下正拿着模型左翻右弄、苦思苦想的时候，看到了灯光下模型的影子。这忽然启发了他，于是他就利用灯光投影的方法把侧面图画出来了。图画好了，还要去翻砂；要翻砂就得做模型。厂里没有翻砂工，自己又不懂，只好到外厂去学习，就这样边做边学地费了一个星期才做好。翻砂虽然成功了，但是要做成机器还要车、刨零件，要加工就要图纸。没有图纸，他就站在车床旁边给车工讲，车工照他讲的样子车。经过几个月的苦想、苦钻、苦试，终于把刨板机制成了。
    除了文化水平低、技术上有困难以外，碰到的再一个困难就是原材料不足，其中主要是缺钢材。他知道现在国家正在进行大规模的建设，需要的钢铁太多，一时生产是赶不上需要的，所以每次搞革新都没有伸手向领导要材料。他紧紧遵循党所指示的土法上马、土洋结合、从土到洋的方针，在革新创造中尽量找代用品，以节约钢铁。如在搞刨边机、多头钻眼机的时候，大部分的部件都是用木材来代替钢铁的。
    在技术革新中，他不但改进自己车间的工具，还考虑到其他车间。他知道一个厂有一个车间生产赶不上，就会影响其他车间，就会影响全厂。搞革新既然不是为了自己而是为了大家，为了社会主义建设，那就应该全盘考虑，所以，他经常帮助别的车间研究改进和创造工具。为了帮助别的车间搞一项创造发明，他经常通宵苦战。他在工作中从来不计报酬，不讲条件。因为他经常加班做活，并且做出很大成绩，厂里要奖励他，可是他坚决拒绝。他说：我是为了建设社会主义，不是为资本家干活，为什么要额外报酬呢？
