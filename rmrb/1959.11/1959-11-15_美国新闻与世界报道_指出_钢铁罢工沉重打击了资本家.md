    "U.S. News & World Report" Points Out
    Steel Strike Heavily打击s Capitalists
    (本报讯) The recent 116-day strike by American steelworkers has already dealt a heavy blow to American monopoly capital, causing significant losses to the profits of American monopoly capital and the financial revenue of the American government. According to the estimates in the November 16th (published in advance) issue of "U.S. News & World Report," the twelve major steel companies in the United States have lost $1.1 billion in profits due to the strike. Railroads have lost $215 million in profits, and coal companies have lost $30 million in profits. The steel strike has also affected the production of the automotive industry. The publication estimates that the U.S. auto industry produced 500,000 fewer vehicles than planned for October-November, resulting in a profit loss of $75 million. Due to the reduction in company profits and worker wages, the U.S. federal government has lost $1.6 billion in tax revenue (including $1.3 billion in profit taxes). "U.S. News & World Report" also said that the losses in wages, profits, and taxes are only estimated up to mid-November. "After this, due to the impact of the strike, this total will increase."

    “美国新闻与世界报道”指出
    钢铁罢工沉重打击了资本家
    本报讯　最近美国钢铁工人举行了一百一十六天的大罢工，已经给了美国垄断资本以沉重的打击，使美国垄断资本的利润和美国政府的财政收入受到了很大的损失。据11月16日（提前出版）的“美国新闻与世界报道”的估计，由于这次罢工，美国十二家大钢铁公司已损失利润十一亿美元，铁路损失利润二亿一千五百万美元，煤矿公司损失利润三千万美元。钢铁罢工也影响到了汽车工业的生产。据该刊估计，美国汽车工业的产量比10—11月的计划少生产了五十万部，损失利润七千五百万美元。由于公司利润和工人工资的减少，美国联邦政府损失了税收十六亿美元（其中利润税为十三亿美元）。“美国新闻与世界报道”还说，工资、利润和税收的损失只估计到11月中为止。“在这以后，由于罢工的影响，这个总数还将增加”。
