Fellow workers across the nation, carry the struggle against right-leaning tendencies through to the end, launch a more extensive and deeper campaign to increase production and practice economy, wholeheartedly support agriculture, complete this year's national production plan ahead of schedule, complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, catch up with and surpass England in the output of major industrial products in about ten years, and ensure a flying start, month-on-month red, and all-round red in next year's production, laying the foundation for year-on-year leaps forward in the years to come.
