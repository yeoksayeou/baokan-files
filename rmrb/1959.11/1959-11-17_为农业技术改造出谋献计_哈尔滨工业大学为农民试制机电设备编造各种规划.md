Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 16th: Harbin Institute of Technology closely integrates teaching, scientific research, and productive labor to support agricultural technological transformation. It has designed and trial-produced a series of small mechanical and electrical equipment suitable for the needs of China's rural areas, that are simple to manufacture and easy to use, such as small machine tool factories and small power stations. It has assisted some provinces, counties, and communes in formulating plans for agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification. The quality of teaching and the scientific level of the relevant majors have also been significantly improved as a result.

Since the spring of this year, Harbin Institute of Technology, in order to adapt to the requirements of rural people's communes for achieving mechanization and water conservancy, determined to design a set of simple machine tools as a graduation design topic for seventeen fifth-year students in the mechanical manufacturing technology major. Under the guidance of three teachers, these seventeen students conducted investigations in five counties in Heilongjiang Province on the industrial situation of counties and communes. In cooperation with relevant research institutions, based on the principle of "minor repairs not leaving the team, major repairs not leaving the commune, and manufacturing not leaving the county," they designed a complete set of twenty-five simple metal cutting machine tools for rural people's communes. Their designs have all been adopted by industrial departments and have been successfully trial-produced in twelve machine tool factories across the country. This set of machine tools is divided into three levels according to different conditions and different manufacturing levels. The first level is suitable for use in county-level comprehensive factories with higher levels, the second level is suitable for use in comprehensive factories with lower levels, both of which are "manufacturing-oriented and repair-assisted"; the third level is suitable for use in factories of rural people's communes and production teams, which is "repair-oriented and manufacturing-assisted". These machine tools have a flexible structure, wide adaptability, and the technology is relatively easy to master. Some of the machine tools can be driven by electric motors, belts, or manually, making them very convenient to use.

The teachers and students of the school's hydraulic machinery, electrical, and electrical measurement majors, combined with the characteristics of their majors, and in response to the needs of small power stations in China's rural areas, have designed and successfully trial-produced a series of new products. The small tubular turbine designed and trial-produced by the hydraulic machinery major has a simple structure and is easy to install. It can be manufactured with cast iron without using any steel, saving about half the metal compared to ordinary small turbines. County and commune machinery factories can manufacture them, making them very suitable for use in rural small power stations. It won the first prize at last year's "Indigenous Equipment" exhibition. So far, this major has supplied more than two hundred copies of blueprints to eleven provinces across the country. Under the leadership of the Party, the power economics major, after in-depth investigation over the past year, has compiled agricultural electrification plans for areas such as Ning'an County in Heilongjiang Province, Hongdong County in Shanxi Province, and Yongchun County in Fujian Province. In their work in Yabuli People's Commune in Shangzhi County, Heilongjiang Province, through experiments on water energy utilization, they reached an important conclusion: by taking specific anti-freezing measures, some small hydroelectric power stations can still generate electricity as usual in the severe cold season in northern Northeast China. This has opened up a path for the utilization of water energy in rural Northeast China during the four to five month long freezing period. They have also conducted research on the coordinated utilization of "water, fire, wind, and biogas" various energy sources, and have initially grasped the direction for the rational utilization of natural energy in northern Northeast China.

The teachers, students, and staff of the school have also combined teaching and work with labor production to produce a variety of products to support the technological transformation of rural areas. These products include: electrical equipment such as generators, motors, transformers, lightning arresters, distribution panels, oil switches, and mechanical equipment such as lathes, portable steam engines, diesel engines, brick making machines, and bench drills. The teachers and students also held hydroelectric power station training classes and local electricity meter training classes to train a group of technicians for the rural areas.

Supporting agricultural technological transformation has played a significant role in improving the school's teaching quality. For example, graduates in the mechanical manufacturing technology major participated in a series of work such as investigation, proposal, design, and manufacturing during the graduation design process, experiencing a complete process that past graduates had never experienced. In the graduation design defense, the vast majority received excellent grades. Under the guidance of teachers, they also compiled a teaching reference book of approximately 200,000 words that combines Chinese actual conditions. Combining support for agricultural technological transformation, the teaching content and quality of the hydraulic machinery major and power economics major this semester have become richer and improved compared to before.

    为农业技术改造出谋献计
    哈尔滨工业大学为农民试制机电设备编造各种规划
    新华社哈尔滨16日电　哈尔滨工业大学密切结合教学、科学研究和生产劳动，支援农业技术改造，设计、试制出一系列适合我国农村需用、制造简单、使用方便的小机械厂和小电站等机电设备，帮助一些省、县、公社制定了农业机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化规划。各有关专业的教学质量和科学水平也因此有了明显的提高。
    今年春季以来，哈尔滨工业大学适应农村人民公社实现机械化、水利化的要求，在科学研究项目中确定设计一套简易机床，作为机械制造工艺专业五年级十七名学生的毕业设计题目。这十七名学生在三名教师的指导下，深入黑龙江省的五个县，对县社工业情况进行了调查，与有关研究机关合作，根据“小修不出队，大修不出社，制造不出县”的原则，设计出了一整套二十五台农村人民公社用的简式金属切削机床。他们的设计已全部为工业部门采用，并在全国十二个机床厂试制成功。这套机床根据不同条件、不同制造水平分为三级，第一级适合于较高水平的县级综合性工厂使用，第二级适合于较低水平的综合性工厂使用，这两级都是以“制造为主，修理为辅”；第三级适合于农村人民公社及生产队的工厂使用，以“修理为主，制造为辅”。这些机床的结构灵巧，适应性广，技术也比较容易掌握，其中有些机床，既可以用电动机带动，也可以用皮带传动，还可以用手摇动，使用非常方便。
    这个学校的水力机械、电器、电测等专业师生，也结合自己专业的特点，针对我国农村小电站的需要，设计和试制成功了一系列的新型产品。水力机械专业设计和试制成功的小型贯流式水轮机，结构简单，安装方便，可以用铸铁制造，不用一点钢材，比起一般小型水轮机来可节省金属一半左右，县和公社的机械厂都能制造，很适合农村小电站应用，获得了去年“土设备”展览会的一等奖。到现在，这个专业已向全国十一个省供给了二百多份图纸。动力经济专业在党的领导下，一年来经过深入调查，为黑龙江省宁安县、山西省洪洞县、福建省永春县等地区编制了农业电气化规划。他们在黑龙江省尚志县亚布力人民公社的工作中，通过对水能利用的试验，得到一个重要结论，即：采取特定的防冻措施，在东北北部严寒的季节里，一部分小型水电站仍然可以照常发电。这为我国东北农村在长达四、五个月之久的冰冻期间利用水能开辟了道路。他们还对“水、火、风、沼”各种能源配合利用进行了研究，初步摸到了在我国东北北部合理利用自然能源的方向。
    这个学校的师生员工还在教学、工作中结合劳动生产制出多种产品支援农村的技术改造。这些产品包括：发电机、电动机、变压器、避雷器、配电盘、油开关等电气装备和车床、锅驼机、柴油机、制砖机、台钻等机械设备。师生们并举办了水电站训练班、土电表训练班，为农村训练了一批技术人员。
    通过支援农业技术改造，对提高学校教学质量已起了很大作用。例如，机械制造工艺专业毕业生，在毕业设计过程中，参加了调查、提出方案、设计和制造等一系列工作，经历了过去毕业生从来没有经历过的完整过程，在毕业设计答辩中绝大部分得到了优良成绩。他们还在教师的指导下编写了一部约有二十万字、结合中国实际情况的教学参考书。水力机械专业、动力经济专业结合支援农业技术改造，这一学期的教学内容和教学质量都比以前更加丰富、提高了。
