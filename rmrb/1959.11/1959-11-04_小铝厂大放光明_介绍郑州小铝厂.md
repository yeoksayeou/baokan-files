Small Aluminum Plant Shines Brightly
Introducing the Zhengzhou Small Aluminum Plant

The Zhengzhou Small Aluminum Plant in Henan Province is a product of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. It was built under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, in accordance with the requirements for the high-speed development of the metallurgical industry and the policy of walking on two legs. Under the leadership of the Party committee, all the workers brought into play their soaring enthusiasm and built a small aluminum plant with an annual output of 1,200 tons of aluminum ingots in just five months. The equipment and tools of this small aluminum plant are very simple; the electrolytic cells are made of red bricks. The total investment of the plant was only 1.4 million yuan, and the investment per ton of aluminum ingot was about 20% lower than that of large plants. At the same time, such small aluminum plants can make full use of the country's decentralized power sources. To build an aluminum plant with an annual output of 25,000 tons, it is necessary to first build a 50,000-kilowatt power station. A plant like the Zhengzhou Small Aluminum Plant only needs a 5,000-kilowatt power source. Compared with large aluminum plants, small aluminum plants have many advantages. In a word, under the current conditions, more aluminum plants can be built at the fastest speed to produce more metallic aluminum for the country and serve the acceleration of socialist construction.

The Zhengzhou Small Aluminum Plant has only been in existence for seven or eight months from its construction to the present, and it has already produced 170 tons of aluminum ingots for the country. This year, it will be able to produce 500 tons, overfulfilling the state plan.

The construction and development of the small aluminum plant have not been smooth sailing. During the construction and production process, it has been subjected to some censure and opposition. In the early stages of construction, the opposition shot the first cold arrow, saying: "Building a small plant is not as good as building a large plant." However, the Party committee of the small aluminum plant, in accordance with the Party's policy of walking on two legs and the needs of socialist construction, resolutely started construction with the support of the higher-level Party committee, and quickly completed the small aluminum plant and put it into production smoothly. In the initial stage of production, because the production situation had not yet returned to normal, the product quality was not good enough. The opposition felt that they had an opportunity to take advantage of it, so they shot the second cold arrow. They said: "It is certain that small aluminum plants can produce aluminum, but the quality of the aluminum ingots produced is low, the consumption is high, and the cost is high," implying that "the gains do not outweigh the losses." This fallacy shook the morale of the army and disintegrated people's fighting spirit. Production cannot move forward without completely defeating their fallacy! At this critical moment, the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced, and the Party Central Committee issued a great call to oppose right-leaning opportunism and defend the Party's General Line. Under the encouragement of the Party's call and under the leadership of the Party committee, all the workers were full of fighting spirit and enthusiasm. After the efforts of August and September, they quickly changed the production face of the small aluminum plant and achieved high output, high quality, and low consumption. The opposition's fallacy was bankrupt in the face of these iron facts.

The reason why the small aluminum plant can achieve high output is because it has adopted the method of accelerating capital construction, opening more electrolytic cells, and increasing the current efficiency to more than 85%. After only four months, the current production level has exceeded the design capacity by 30%. All the workers are working hard to carry out technical innovation, and they want to make the technical indicators approach or catch up with modern large aluminum plants within this year, so as to further improve the production level.

The quality of aluminum mainly depends on the quality of the raw materials used and the maintenance and management of production equipment, and not on the size of the plant and the size of the electrolytic cell. In order to overcome the quality hurdle of aluminum, the workers of the Zhengzhou Small Aluminum Plant, under the leadership of the Party, summarized operational experience through the method of three-way combination, and implemented the operational method of one fast (fast aluminum production), two cleanliness (factory cleanliness, tool cleanliness), three diligence (diligent processing, diligent inspection, diligent tool replacement), and four low (low electrolyte level, low temperature operation, low molecular ratio, low effect coefficient). In August, first-grade aluminum was produced, and in September, special-grade aluminum was produced, eliminating unqualified off-grade products. This kind of aluminum can be used for anything, it can be used to make civilian processed products, and it can also be used to make industrial processed products.

The Zhengzhou Small Aluminum Plant can reduce product costs because it adopts low-voltage and low-temperature operation methods. After adopting this method, power consumption was reduced from 29,300 kWh per ton of aluminum to 21,800 kWh, and efforts are now being made to break through the 20,000 kWh mark; the consumption of main raw materials such as fluoride salts, alumina, anode paste, as well as aluminum oxide and anode paste, is also constantly decreasing. Now, the production cost of the Zhengzhou Small Aluminum Plant, based on comparable parts, has reached the level of the initial start-up of large aluminum plants.

These iron facts prove that small aluminum plants can completely achieve high output, high quality, and low cost. These iron facts also powerfully refuted the right-leaning opportunists' attacks on the General Line and vividly proved that the Party's policy of simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises is the correct path for the high-speed development of my country's industry.

    小铝厂大放光明
    介绍郑州小铝厂
    河南省郑州小铝厂是1958年大跃进的产物，是在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，根据高速度发展冶金工业的要求和两条腿走路的方针建设起来的。全体职工在党委领导下发挥了冲天的干劲，仅仅用了五个月的时间，就建成了年产铝锭一千二百吨的小铝厂。这个小铝厂的设备和工具都很简陋，电解槽是用红砖砌成的。全厂投资仅用了一百四十万元，每吨铝锭的投资比大厂节省20％左右。同时，这样的小铝厂可以充分利用国家的分散电源，建一个年产二万五千吨的铝厂，必须首先建立五万瓩的电站，像郑州小铝厂这样的厂子，只要有五千瓩的电源就可以了。小铝厂与大铝厂比较，具有很多优点，一句话，在目前条件下可以用最快的速度建设更多的铝厂，为国家生产出更多的金属铝，为加速社会主义建设事业服务。
    郑州小铝厂从建厂到现在，不过七、八个月的时间，已经为国家生产了铝锭一百七十吨，今年将可以生产五百吨，超额完成了国家计划。
    小铝厂的建设和发展不是一帆风顺的，在建设到生产的过程中，都曾遭到一些非难和反对。在建设初期，反对派就射来了第一支冷箭，他们说：“建小厂不如建大厂”。但是小铝厂党委根据党的两条腿走路的方针和社会主义建设的需要，在上级党委的支持下，坚决开始了建设，并且很快就把小铝厂建成，顺利地投入了生产。在投入生产初期，由于生产情况还没有转入正常，产品质量不够好。反对派这时又觉得有机可乘，于是射来了第二支冷箭。他们说：“小铝厂能生产铝是肯定的，但生产的铝锭质量低、消耗大、成本高”，大有“得不偿失”之意。这种谬论，动摇着军心，瓦解着人们的斗志，不彻底打垮他们的谬论，生产是不能前进的！就在这个紧要关头，党的八届八中全会的决议公布了，党中央发出了反对右倾机会主义、保卫党的总路线的伟大号召，全厂职工在党的号召的鼓舞下，在党委的领导下，个个斗志昂扬、干劲十足，经过8、9两月的努力，迅速改变了小铝厂的生产面貌，作到了高产、优质、低耗。反对派的谬论，在这铁的事实面前破产了。
    小铝厂所以能够高产，是因为采取了加速基本建设，多开电解槽，把电流效率提高到了85％以上的办法。经过短短的四个月后，现在生产水平已经超过设计能力的30％，全体职工正在鼓足干劲，大闹技术革新，要在今年内使技术指标接近或赶上现代化大铝厂，使生产水平进一步提高。
    铝的质量好坏，主要决定于所用原材料的质量和生产设备维护及管理工作的好坏，而不决定于厂子的大小和电解槽的大小。郑州小铝厂职工为了攻下铝的质量关，在党的领导下通过三结合的方法，总结了操作经验，实行了一快（快出铝），二洁（厂房清洁、工具清洁），三勤（勤加工、勤检查、勤换工具），四低（低电解质水平、低温操作、低分子比、低效应系数）的操作方法，在8月份就产出了一级铝，9月份产出了特级铝，消灭了不合格的等外产品。这样的铝，作什么都行，可以用来作民用加工品，也可以作工业加工品。
    郑州小铝厂能够降低产品成本，是由于采用了低电压及低温操作方法。采用这种方法以后，电耗从每吨铝消耗二万九千三百度降低到二万一千八百度，现正为突破二万度的大关努力；主要原料如氟化盐、氧化铝、阳极糊以及铝氧和阳极糊的消耗方面，也在不断降低。现在郑州小铝厂的生产成本，按可比部分说，已经达到大铝厂开工初期的水平。
    这些铁的事实证明，小铝厂是完全可以作到高产、优质、低成本的。这些铁的事实也有力地回击了右倾机会主义分子对总路线的攻击，生动地证明了党所指出的大中小企业并举的方针，是高速度发展我国工业的正确道路。
