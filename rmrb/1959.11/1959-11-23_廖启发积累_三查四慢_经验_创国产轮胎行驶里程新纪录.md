    Liao Qifa Accumulates "Three Checks and Four Slows" Experience
    Creates New Record for Domestic Tire Mileage
    △ Liao Qifa, a bus driver from Nanjing Automobile Company, and his partner Li Shaoxiang worked closely together to create a new national record for domestic tire mileage. One Xinzhongguo (New China) brand tire used on their bus had traveled 282,015 kilometers from 1954 to the end of September this year; the remaining five tires installed later had also traveled an average of 194,280 kilometers each.
    Liao Qifa is very careful about the maintenance and care of tires and has accumulated experience in "Three Checks" and "Four Slows." The "Three Checks" are: check before departure, check upon arrival, and check at the terminal station. Before the bus departs, he always arrives early to fully check whether there are any problems with the steering, braking, lights, and instruments, and whether the steel plates and tire screws are loose. He uses a small wooden stick to tap the tires to check if the tire pressure is sufficient. When the vehicle arrives at night, he first checks whether there are any debris such as stones or iron pieces in the parking lot, and then chooses a flat place to park, so that the vehicle does not stay overnight in uneven places. Sometimes when it rains and there is water in the parking lot, he always avoids it or gets some yellow mud and stones to dry the water and fill the pits before parking the bus, so that the tires are not soaked in the water. In the hot summer, sometimes the bus is parked at the station, and he is afraid of being exposed to the sun, so he always finds some old reed mats to cover the tires. After entering the station, he also checks the various parts of the machine and the tires, and promptly studies and solves any problems found. When the bus is running outside and arrives at the terminal station, he always picks out the stones on the tires. He said, "Stones embedded in the tire tread are like sand getting into the eyes, causing swelling and discomfort. I must take them out to feel relieved." The "Four Slows" are: slow start, slow entry into the station, slow downhill, turning, crossing bridges, and crossing railways, and slow at intersections. He always maintains a normal speed when driving, pays attention to using the brakes less, and tries to avoid using emergency brakes. During driving, he always chooses the road surface correctly, avoids potholes to prevent tire punctures, and prevents the wheels from vibrating and affecting tire life.
    Now, he is determined to let the tire that has already set a new record travel another 50,000 kilometers, moving towards 330,000 kilometers.

    廖启发积累“三查四慢”经验
    创国产轮胎行驶里程新纪录
    △南京汽车公司客车驾驶员廖启发同他的搭班李绍祥密切合作，创造了国产轮胎行驶里程的全国新纪录。他们客车上装用的一只新中国牌轮胎，从1954年到今年9月底已行驶二十八万二千零十五公里；后来装用的其余五只轮胎平均每只也已行驶十九万四千二百八十公里。
    廖启发对轮胎的保养和爱护是十分当心的，并且积累“三查”、“四慢”的经验。三查是：出场检查，进场检查，行驶到终点站检查。车子出场前，他总是提前进场，充分检查转向、制动、灯光、仪表等有无毛病，钢板、轮胎螺丝有无松劲，用小木棒敲敲轮胎气压是否足。车辆晚上进场时，首先看看场地有无石头、铁片等杂物，然后选择平整的地方停下来，不使车辆在高低不平的地方过夜。有时天下雨，停车场有积水，他总是让开或是弄些黄泥、石子把水弄干，坑填平，再把车子停好，不让轮胎泡在水里。在炎热的夏天，有时车子停在站上，怕被太阳曝晒，他总是找些旧芦席把轮胎盖好。进场后也要检查各部分机件和轮胎，一发现问题及时研究解决。车子在外面行驶，到了终点站，他总要把轮胎上的石子剔下来。他说：“石子嵌在轮胎花纹里，好像沙灰迷了眼睛一样，发胀不舒服，非要把它弄出来才放心。”“四慢”是：起步慢，进站慢，下坡、转弯、过桥、过铁路慢，交叉路口慢。他开车总是保持正常时速，注意少用刹车，尽量避免使用紧急刹车。在行驶中他总是很正确地选择路面，避开坑凹，防止戳伤轮胎，防止车轮发生震跳，影响轮胎寿命。
    现在，他决心让那只已创造新纪录的轮胎，再行驶五万公里，向三十三万公里迈进。
