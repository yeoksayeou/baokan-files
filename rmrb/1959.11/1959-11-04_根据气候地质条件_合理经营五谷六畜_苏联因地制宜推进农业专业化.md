Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 3rd: During the Seven-Year Plan, Soviet agricultural production will further develop towards specialization, so that all regions of the country have greater possibilities to plant various crops according to local conditions, and achieve a new upsurge in Soviet agriculture and animal husbandry.

In recent years, the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union have taken a series of concrete measures to rapidly develop agricultural production, and have achieved great success. In the past few years, the Russian Federal Republic and the Kazakh Republic have reclaimed nearly 40 million hectares of wasteland, which has not only greatly expanded the area of cultivated land in the Soviet Union, but also greatly changed the geographical distribution of various crop productions. Before the large-scale land reclamation in the Soviet Union in 1953, the Ukrainian Republic had always been the main grain-producing area of the Soviet Union. After the large-scale land reclamation, the Soviet grain production center gradually shifted from the south to the eastern region. The annual grain output of the Kazakh Republic has now increased several times over that of Ukraine, ranking second in the Soviet Union, second only to the Russian Federation.

Due to sufficient grain obtained in the newly reclaimed areas, the southern regions of the Soviet Union, such as Ukraine, Belarus, the South Caucasus, and the Baltic coastal republics, can use most of their cultivated land to grow industrial crops and feed crops. For example, more than half of the cultivated land in Ukraine is currently used to develop industrial crops and feed crops. This creates good conditions for supplying a large amount of industrial raw materials and meeting the needs of people's lives.

During the Seven-Year Plan, the main policy of the Soviet Union to develop agricultural production is to continue to increase grain output. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the annual grain output will reach 10 to 11 billion poods. At the same time, the Soviet Union will vigorously develop animal husbandry and the production of industrial crops. In order to complete this huge task assigned by the Party to agricultural workers, the republics have formulated new plans for agricultural production specialization based on local conditions. Further realizing the specialization of agricultural production is currently an important link in effectively ensuring the rational use of agricultural production potential, effectively realizing the comprehensive mechanization and electrification of agricultural production, and improving labor productivity.

During the Seven-Year Plan, the specialization direction of agricultural production in the largest republic of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federal Republic, is to increase grain production. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the annual grain output of the Russian Federation will reach 7 to 8 billion poods, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total grain output of the Soviet Union at that time.

During the Seven-Year Plan, Ukraine will become a strong base for the production of industrial crops and animal husbandry. The climate and geological conditions of this republic are very suitable for growing bast fiber crops, sugar beets, oil crops, and feed crops. Therefore, in addition to growing a portion of grain, the cultivated area of sugar beets will be expanded to 300,000 hectares, with an annual output of 40 million tons of sugar beets; sugar production will increase from 3.7 million tons in 1957 to 5.3 million tons, an increase that is exactly equal to France's total annual sugar production in 1957. The southern part of the republic has abundant sunshine and is suitable for growing a large number of oil crops—sunflowers. The republic's animal husbandry production has a very good foundation, and agricultural workers have decided to complete the animal husbandry production tasks stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan five years ahead of schedule.

Due to the reclamation of 2.3 million hectares of wasteland, the Kazakh Republic has changed from a region that can only be self-sufficient in food to a region that supplies a large amount of food to other places. During the Seven-Year Plan, the republic's agricultural production will still focus on increasing grain production.

Agricultural production in other republics will also be further specialized. Belarus and the three Baltic coastal republics will become highly concentrated development areas for meat, milk, oil, and other products. The Central Asian republics of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan will develop cotton production. Georgia and Armenia are suitable for growing subtropical industrial crops, and tea and fruit production will be greatly developed.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 3rd: In recent years, the Soviet Union has not only paid attention to vigorously developing grain production in agriculture, but also to developing the production of various industrial crops. The output of cotton, sugar beet, flax, oil crops, etc. has also increased rapidly.

According to statistical materials published in newspapers and periodicals, the Soviet Union's raw cotton production reached more than 4.37 million tons in 1958, an increase of more than 500,000 tons compared with 1953. The cotton planting area in 1958 increased by more than 270,000 hectares compared with 1953. The total output of sugar beet in 1958 was more than 54.1 million tons, more than double that of 1953; the planting area in 1958 was more than 900,000 hectares more than in 1953. The output of flax reached more than 430,000 tons in 1958, an increase of about 1.5 times compared with 1953; the planting area has also increased a lot. The development of oil crops is also very rapid. In 1958, the Soviet Union's vegetable oil production reached more than 1.4 million tons, and the oil crop planting area reached more than 5 million hectares. Both the total output and the planting area have increased a lot compared with 1953.

The Soviet Union now ranks first in the world in the production of sugar beet and flax.

Developing industrial crops is an important part of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan in developing agriculture. According to the plan, by 1965, the Soviet Union's raw cotton output will reach more than 6 million tons, sugar beet—84 million tons, flax—580,000 tons, and vegetable oil—2 million tons. The state's procurement and storage of these industrial crops will also increase significantly in seven years.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 3rd: This year, agricultural workers in various parts of the Soviet Union have expanded the planting area of ​​feed, especially the planting area of ​​corn and annual forage grass, in order to ensure the needs of the increasingly developing animal husbandry for feed.

Currently, agricultural workers in various places are actively preparing winter feed for livestock. By the beginning of October, collective farms and state farms in various places had harvested and stored 99 million tons of coarse feed, an increase of 3.5 million tons over the same period last year.

Agricultural workers in various places have launched a competition for the rapid harvesting of feed to welcome the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which will be held soon to discuss agricultural issues.

    根据气候地质条件　合理经营五谷六畜
    苏联因地制宜推进农业专业化
    据新华社莫斯科3日电　苏联农业生产在七年计划期间将进一步向生产专业化方面发展，以便使得全国各地区有更大的可能来因地制宜地种植各种农作物，使苏联农业、畜牧业生产获得新的高涨。
    近年来，苏联共产党和政府为迅速发展农业生产，曾采取了一系列具体措施，并取得了巨大成就。最近几年来，俄罗斯联邦共和国和哈萨克共和国开垦了将近四千万公顷荒地，这不仅使苏联的耕地面积大大扩大了，而且也使各种农作物生产在地理配置上起了很大改变。在1953年苏联大规模开荒之前，乌克兰共和国历来就是苏联的主要产粮区，而在大规模开荒以后，苏联的谷物生产中心就由南方逐渐移至东部地区。哈萨克共和国的谷物年产量现在已经数倍地超过乌克兰，跃居为全苏第二位，仅次于俄罗斯联邦。
    由于在新垦地区获得了足够的粮食，苏联南部地区，如乌克兰、白俄罗斯以及南高加索和波罗的海沿岸各共和国就可以用大半耕地来种植技术作物和饲料作物。例如，目前乌克兰已有一半以上的耕地用来发展技术作物和饲料作物。这为大量供应工业原料和满足人民生活需要创造着良好的条件。
    在七年计划期间，苏联发展农业生产的主要方针是继续增加谷物产量。到七年计划结束时，谷物年产量将达到一百至一百一十亿普特。同时，苏联还大力发展畜牧业和技术作物的生产。为了完成党对农业劳动者提出的这一巨大任务，各共和国根据各地具体情况，制订了新的农业生产专业化的规划。因为进一步实现农业生产的专业化，已是目前有效地保证合理发挥农业生产潜力、有效地实现农业生产全面机械化和电气化以及提高劳动生产率的重要环节。
    苏联最大的加盟共和国——俄罗斯联邦共和国在七年计划期间，农业生产的专业化方向是增加谷物的生产。到七年计划结束时，俄罗斯联邦的谷物年产量将达到七十至八十亿普特，即占那时全苏谷物总产量的三分之二以上。
    乌克兰在七年计划期间将成为技术作物和畜牧业生产的强大基地。这个共和国的气候、地质条件非常适合于种植麻类作物、甜菜、油料和饲料作物，因此，共和国除了种植一部分谷物之外，甜菜的耕地面积将扩大到三十万公顷，年产甜菜四千万吨；糖产量将由1957年的三百七十万吨增为五百三十万吨，这个增加数字正好等于1957年法国全年的糖产量。共和国南部地区阳光充足，适合于大量种植油料作物——向日葵。共和国的畜牧业生产有着很好的基础，农业劳动者决定在五年内提前完成七年计划规定的畜牧业生产任务。
    哈萨克共和国由于开垦了二百三十万公顷荒地，已从粮食只能自给的地区变成了向外地供应大批粮食的地区。七年计划期间，共和国的农业生产仍以增加谷物生产为主。
    其他各加盟共和国农业生产也要进一步专业化。白俄罗斯和波罗的海沿岸三个共和国将成为肉类、奶类、油脂等产品高度集中发展的地区。中亚细亚的乌兹别克、土库曼、吉尔吉斯和塔吉克等共和国将发展棉花生产。格鲁吉亚、亚美尼亚共和国适合种植亚热带技术作物，茶叶和水果的生产将大有发展。
    据新华社莫斯科3日电　苏联最近几年来，在农业中不仅注意大力发展谷物业，而且也注意发展各种技术作物的生产。棉花、甜菜、亚麻、油料作物等的产量提高得也很快。
    根据报刊发表的统计材料，苏联原棉生产1958年达到了四百三十七万多吨，比1953年增加了五十多万吨。1958年棉花播种面积比1953年增加了二十七万多公顷。甜菜1958年的总产量是五千四百一十多万吨，比1953年增加了一倍多；播种面积1958年比1953年多九十多万公顷。亚麻的产量1958年达到四十三万多吨，比1953年增加了约一倍半；播种面积也增加了不少。油料作物的发展也很迅速。1958年苏联植物油的产量达到一百四十多万吨，油料作物播种面积达到五百多万公顷，不论总产量和播种面积都比1953年增加很多。
    苏联现在甜菜和亚麻的产量已占世界第一位。
    发展技术作物是苏联七年计划中在发展农业上的一个重要部分。按照计划，到1965年，苏联原棉产量将达六百多万吨，甜菜——八千四百万吨，亚麻——五十八万吨，植物油——二百万吨。国家对这些技术作物的采购储存数量在七年中也将大量增长。
    新华社莫斯科3日电　今年苏联各地农业劳动者都扩大了饲料的播种面积，特别是玉蜀黍和一年生饲草的播种面积，以便保证日益发展的畜牧业对饲料的需要。
    现在，各地农业劳动者正在积极准备牲畜的过冬饲料。到10月初，各地集体农庄和国营农场已经收割和贮存了九千九百万吨粗饲料，这比去年同期增加了三百五十万吨。
    各地农业劳动者展开了快速收割饲料的竞赛，来迎接苏共中央为讨论农业问题而即将召开的全体会议。
