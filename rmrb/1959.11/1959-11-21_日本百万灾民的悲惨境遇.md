The cawing of crows echoes, the red maples fade, and although it is only the transition between autumn and winter, the hearts of Japan's ninety million people are shrouded in chilling winter air due to the recent massive typhoon! The slogan "Save a Million Disaster Victims" is resounding throughout the Japanese archipelago.

	The Biggest Typhoon Since the War

In late September of this year, Typhoon No. 15, known as the "Ise Bay Typhoon," swept across most of Japan, centering on the Pacific coast of central Honshu Island. Where the typhoon passed, storms raged, rivers overflowed, and towering waves breached dikes and landed, floods and muddy currents swallowed countless wealth created by the hard work of the Japanese people, and tens of thousands of people lost their lives.

This typhoon struck more than thirty prefectures in Japan (Japan has a total of forty-six prefectures). In terms of both the affected area and the severity of the disaster, it was the largest wind disaster Japan has encountered since the war. According to preliminary official Japanese statistics, nearly seven thousand people were killed, injured, or missing during the typhoon, and the total number of people affected by the typhoon exceeded one million four hundred and fifty thousand. The areas particularly hard hit by the typhoon were Nagoya, Japan's third largest city near Ise Bay, and the surrounding granary areas. In the three prefectures of Aichi, Gifu, and Mie alone, 200,000 households (approximately one million people) of farmers suffered disaster, 400,000 houses were destroyed or submerged in water, and more than 90,000 hectares of land suffered severe topsoil loss. The losses of farmland water conservancy facilities, factories, and transportation equipment amounted to several hundred billion yen.

Although the typhoon has passed for nearly two months, the vast majority of disaster victims are hungry and poorly clothed, wandering in mud and rubble due to the Kishida government's unwillingness to actively provide relief. Moreover, infectious diseases such as dysentery are rampant, causing immense suffering. Not to mention the hundreds of thousands of workers who have no work to do and the nearly one million farmers who have no land to cultivate.

Is it a Natural Disaster or a "Man-Made Disaster"?

After the typhoon disaster occurred, the Kishida government tried its best to use "Japan's poverty" and "the irresistible nature of natural disasters" as excuses to evade responsibility. This aroused boundless indignation among the vast majority of Japanese people. The Japanese people believe that rather than a natural disaster, it was a "man-made disaster" caused by the Kishida government's reactionary policies that disregard the interests of the people. As the "Japan News" weekly stated: "The Ise Bay Typhoon once again made people understand the terror of natural forces. However, now people are not talking about the threat of nature, but first and foremost casting angry eyes at the Kishida government. This is because everyone sees very clearly that the fundamental reason why the typhoon disaster reached such a serious level lies in the policies of successive governments, especially the Kishida government."

Japan is one of the countries in the world most frequently hit by typhoons. Every year from July to November, more than ten typhoons originating near the Marshall, Caroline, and Mariana Islands invade Japan. The average annual loss from typhoon disasters after the war reached 240 billion yen. However, successive Japanese governments after the war turned a blind eye to this situation, which constantly threatens the safety of the Japanese people, and only cared about using the taxes they squeezed from the people to rearm and help monopoly capital get rich. According to estimates by Japanese experts, it would only take 1.2 trillion yen to completely eliminate wind and flood disasters in Japan. However, from 1950, when the Yoshida government began rearming according to American instructions, until 1959, direct military spending alone amounted to 1.17 trillion yen. Therefore, it is entirely possible to eradicate typhoon disasters.

Since the Kishida government came to power in 1957, it has allocated several hundred billion yen from the national treasury every year to engage in nuclear armament and revive Japanese militarist forces, while remaining equally indifferent to preventing typhoon disasters. Before the arrival of this typhoon, there were warnings from the meteorological observatory, but the Kishida government ignored them. It is entirely understandable that the Japanese people deeply resent the Kishida government's reactionary policies of acting against the tide of history. A housewife in Nagano Prefecture condemned the Kishida government in the "Asahi Shimbun" saying: If the money used to buy American jet fighters were used to control typhoons, "then there would not be so many wives crying to the heavens searching for their husbands and children weeping over their father's corpses..." A farmer in the disaster area angrily pointed at the Kishida government and said: "I hate this government!" A young man in Tokyo criticized at a "street discussion": "Suffering from typhoon disasters regularly every year is a murderous crime committed by the state!"

Kishida's "Disaster Relief" Tricks

After the typhoon disaster occurred, the Kishida government, under pressure from the severity of the disaster and the people's dissatisfaction with it, made some gestures of "disaster relief." However, progressive Japanese public opinion exposed that Kishida is not truly concerned about the people's suffering, but is instead trying to use the "disaster relief" opportunity to promote militarist ideology with ulterior motives. For example, the Kishida government mobilized the "Self-Defense Forces" and the police to take joint action in the disaster area, nominally to "rescue" disaster victims and "assist" disaster victims in rebuilding their homes. In fact, its calculations are: 1. To attempt to restore the "prestige" of the "Self-Defense Forces," which had been discredited among the masses; 2. To attempt to create a precedent in fact for its long-planned practice of joint military-police action interfering in civil administration; 3. In the event of a disaster victim riot, the "Self-Defense Forces" can participate in the suppression. In fact, according to reports by "Akahata" reporters, the "Self-Defense Forces" not only did not do any work, but also caused many troubles for the disaster victims, arousing their dissatisfaction. For example, in addition to personally inspecting the disaster area, Kishida also specially sent Crown Prince Akihito to the disaster area to conduct "condolences" in order to promote the "imperial grace" of the Emperor. And his American "ally" sent an aircraft carrier of the Seventh Fleet to Nagoya to "assist" the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" in their work. Whether this was to "rescue" disaster victims or to prevent and intimidate Japanese disaster victims who opposed the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" from causing trouble is even more suspect.

For the Kishida government, if it wants to express its "sincerity" in disaster relief, nothing would be better than to provide a large amount of money and materials to solve the problems of food, clothing, housing, and transportation for the disaster victims and to help them rebuild their homes. However, the Kishida government "talked big but spent little money" on this issue. According to Japanese newspapers, only 34 billion yen was allocated for disaster relief in the supplementary budget submitted by the Japanese Ministry of Finance to the temporary session of the Diet. According to surveys and statistics up to October 18, the losses of public utilities facilities alone amounted to more than 200 billion yen, not to mention the millions of disaster victims who urgently need relief. Only heaven knows what role this little money can play!

What particularly angered the Japanese people was that the Kishida clique was trying its best to use "disaster relief" as a pretext to seek private gain and expand its own power. According to "Akahata," Banboku Ohno, Vice President of the Liberal Democratic Party, said in Ogaki City, Gifu Prefecture, at the end of October that the Kishida government would give preferential treatment to "cities that love our party" when distributing relief funds. He also said that the Liberal Democratic Party could not accept the application submitted by the Speaker of the City Council of the Socialist Party to increase the relief budget, but would unconditionally agree to the application of the Speaker of the Liberal Democratic Party. The "Japan News" weekly also revealed that the Liberal Democratic Party is using the excuse that "the mayor of the Socialist Party cannot bear the huge disaster relief work" to replace the current mayor of Nagoya with a mayor from the Liberal Democratic Party.

The Japanese Communist Party Stands at the Forefront of Disaster Relief

In contrast to the Kishida government's ugly "disaster relief" tricks, people from all walks of life in Japan have extended warm hands of assistance to their compatriots who have suffered disasters. The Japanese Socialist Party, Communist Party, "Sohyo" (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan), and the Japan National Relief Association and other progressive democratic parties and people's organizations, on the one hand, demanded that the Kishida government cut military spending and increase the disaster relief budget, and on the other hand, actively called for and widely mobilized financial and material resources to go to the disaster area to help the disaster victims. "Sohyo" and the National Relief Association and other groups have already taken a large number of daily necessities, clothing, medicines, and food to help the disaster victims. Democratic forces in the disaster area also organized a democratic group water disaster countermeasure council including the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, trade unions, and commercial and industrial associations, which immediately took action after the disaster occurred. Now, this joint organization for people's disaster relief has been universally established in the disaster-stricken areas. Donation movements by people in various places have also been widely launched.

The activities of the Japanese Communist Party in disaster relief have won praise from the vast majority of Japanese people. After the disaster occurred, the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party established a disaster countermeasures committee, and party organizations at all levels and the vast number of party members have been at the forefront of the disaster relief movement. For example, before other political parties organized medical teams, the Communist Party was the first to send a medical team to the disaster area. Before any newspaper reporter arrived in the disaster area, reporters from the Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata" overcame all difficulties and took the lead in going deep into the disaster area to report and petition for the disaster victims. Until now, "Akahata" reports the real situation in the disaster area to all sectors every day, calls on all sectors to provide disaster relief, and exposes the Kishida government's conspiracies. The rescue trucks sent by the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party to the disaster area were also the first batch of trucks sent by the private sector. What is particularly valuable is that many Communist Party members whose families are in the disaster area have shown the noble character of selflessness. They disregard the difficulties of their families suffering from hunger and cold and instead organize workers, farmers, and citizens to fight to overcome the disaster. Under their advocacy and organization, disaster victims in many places have organized and established "Disaster Victims Alliances" to carry out a tenacious struggle against the Kishida government's policies that neglect the interests of disaster victims. For example, Takaba Tadami, a Communist Party member in Tsukumi-cho, Nagoya City, which was severely affected by the disaster, traveled around despite the difficulties of his family of eight lacking food and clothing to understand the situation of the disaster victims and formed the "Disaster Victims Alliance" of Tsukumi-cho. This disaster victim organization put forward fourteen demands such as "guaranteeing emergency housing" and "quickly sorting out lost land in order to rebuild homes" and conducted tough negotiations with the ward office.

At present, a temporary session of the Japanese Diet is being held, and the issue of typhoon disaster relief has become one of the focuses of the struggle between the progressive democratic forces and the Kishida reactionary government. This is a major issue that concerns the lives of millions of people. Under the rule of the Kishida government, the extent to which this issue can be resolved in a way that benefits the people remains to be seen depending on the strengthening of the struggle by the Japanese people and democratic forces. (Attached picture)

No, the people are not passively waiting for "relief." Look, they are taking action and putting forward the loud slogan: "Take military spending and use it to relieve the disaster-stricken people!"
It has been almost a month since the typhoon passed, but the reactionary authorities are only busy expanding their armaments and preparing for war, and are delaying in carrying out post-disaster relief work. Here, a mother and her two daughters stare blankly at their flooded home. When will they be able to live in peace again?

    日本百万灾民的悲惨境遇
    罗葆齐
    寒鸦惊啼，枫红黯逝，虽然时令还只是秋冬交替的时候，但是由于不久前一次特大台风的侵袭，日本九千万人民的心头却已笼罩着凛烈的冬寒了！“拯救上百万灾民”的口号，正响彻着整个日本列岛。
      战后最大的台风
    今年9月下旬，一场被称作“伊势湾台风”的十五号台风，以本州岛中部的太平洋沿岸为中心席卷了大半个日本。台风过处，暴风雨大作，河川泛滥，滔滔海浪破堤登陆，洪水浊流吞噬了日本人民辛勤劳动创造的无数财富，成千上万的人断送了性命。
    这次台风袭击了日本的三十几个都道府县（日本全国共有四十六个都道府县），不论就受灾面积和灾情严重程度来说，都是战后日本遇到的最大一次风灾。据日本官方初步统计，在台风袭来时死伤和去向不明者近七千人，而受到这次台风灾害的总计在一百四十五万人以上。在这次台风中受害特别深的是临近伊势湾的日本第三大城市名古屋及其周围的谷仓地带。其中爱知、岐阜、三重三县就有二十万户（约一百万人）农民罹灾，有四十万栋房屋被风雨所毁或浸在水中，有九万多公顷土地表土流失严重。至于农田水利设施、工厂和交通设备等的损失更达几千亿日元之巨。
    台风虽然已经过去近两个月，但是由于岸信介政府不肯积极救援，广大灾民饥肠辘辘，衣不蔽体，辗转在泥水和瓦砾场中，而且痢疾等传染疾病猖獗，痛苦不堪。更不要说几十万工人无工可做，近百万农民无田可耕了。
    天灾抑是“人祸”？
    台风灾害发生后，岸信介政府竭力以“日本贫困”和“天灾不可抗拒”为借口，企图逃避责任。这激起了日本广大人民的无比愤慨。日本人民认为，与其说是天灾，不如说是因岸信介政府无视人民利益的反动政策所造成的“人祸”。正如“日本新闻”周报所说：“伊势湾台风再一次使人们领教了自然力的恐怖。但是，现在人们不是谈论大自然的威胁，而首先是以愤怒的目光朝着岸信介政府。这是因为任何人都看得很清楚，台风灾害所以达到如此严重程度，根本原因在于历届政府，尤其是岸信介政府的政治。”
    日本是世界上遭受台风袭击最多的国家之一。每年从7月到11月，从马绍尔、加洛林、马利亚那群岛附近发生的台风总要有十几次侵入日本。战后每年平均受台风灾害的损失达二千四百亿日元。然而，战后日本历届政府对这个经常威胁日本人民安全的情况视若无睹，只顾拿它们从人民搜刮的税金去重整军备、帮助垄断资本发财致富。据日本的专家们估计，只要花一万二千亿日元，就可以使日本的风灾水灾完全消除。而从1950年吉田政府按照美国指示开始重整军备到1959年为止，仅直接军费一项就达一万一千七百亿日元，因此根治台风灾害是完全可以办得到的。
    岸信介政府从1957年上台以来，每年都从国库拨出几千亿日元来搞核武装和复活日本军国主义势力，对于防治台风灾害同样漠不关心。这次台风到来之前，本有气象台的警报，岸信介政府却听之任之。日本人民对岸信介政府倒行逆施的反动政策深恶痛绝，是完全可以理解的。长野县一个家庭妇女在“朝日新闻”上谴责岸信介政府说：如果把买美国喷气式战斗机的钱用于治台风，“那末就不会有这么多呼天唤地寻夫的妻子和抚着父亲尸体痛哭的孩儿……”灾区的一个农民怒冲冲地指着岸信介政府说：“我恨这个政府！”东京一个青年在“街头讨论会”上指责说：“每年定期地要受台风灾害，这是国家犯下的杀人罪行！”
    岸信介的“救灾”把戏
    台风灾害发生后，岸信介政府迫于灾情的严重性和人民对它的不满，作了一些“救灾”的姿态。但是，日本进步舆论揭露，岸信介不是真正关心人民疾苦，而是别有用心地想利用“救灾”机会宣扬军国主义思想。比如岸信介政府动员“自卫队”和警察共同行动去灾区，名义上是“抢救”灾民、“协助”灾民重整家园，其实它的算盘是：一、企图挽回在群众中声名狼借的“自卫队”的“威信”；二、企图在事实上为它久已策划的军警共同行动干涉民政的作法开创先例；三、一旦灾民暴动，“自卫队”可以参加镇压。事实上，据“赤旗报”记者报道，“自卫队”不仅没有作什么工作，反而给灾民增加了许多麻烦，引起灾民的不满。又如岸信介除了本人去灾区视察外，还特地把皇太子明仁送到灾区去进行“慰问”，借以宣扬天皇的“龙恩”。而他的美国“盟友”派出第七舰队一艘航空母舰去名古屋“协助”日本“自卫队”工作，究竟是为了“救灾”还是为了防止和恫吓反对日美“安全条约”的日本灾民闹事，那就更值得怀疑了。
    对于岸信介政府来说，如果要表示救灾的“诚意”，莫过于拿出大量金钱和物资解决灾民的衣食住行问题和帮助他们重整家园。但是，岸信介政府在这个问题上却“说大话使小钱”。据日本报纸报道，日本大藏省向国会临时会议提出的补充预算中用于救灾的只有三百四十亿日元。截至10月18日为止的调查统计，仅公共事业设施的损失就有二千亿日元之多，更不用说上百万灾民急待救济了。这点钱究竟能起什么作用，只有天晓得！
    尤其使日本人民愤慨的是，岸信介集团极力想以“救灾”为名，来谋求私利和扩大自己的势力。据“赤旗报”揭露，自由民主党副总裁大野伴睦10月底在岐阜县大垣市发表谈话说，岸信介政府在发放救济金时，将优待“热爱我党的城市”。他还说，自由民主党不能接受社会党的市议会议长提出的增加救济金预算的申请，但是将无条件地答应自由民主党的议长的申请。“日本新闻”周报也揭露，自由民主党正以“社会党的市长负担不了巨大救灾工作”为借口，想用自由民主党的市长来取代现任的名古屋市长。
    日共站在救  灾的最前线
    同岸信介政府丑恶的“救灾”把戏相反，日本各界人民对于受灾的同胞伸出了热情的救援之手。日本社会党、共产党、“总评”和日本国民救援会等进步民主政党和人民团体，一面要求岸信介政府削减军费、增加救灾预算，一面积极呼吁并广泛地动员财力、物力到灾区去救援灾民。“总评”和国民救援会等团体，就已拿出大批生活日用品、衣物、药品和粮食去接济灾民。灾区的民主力量还组织了包括共产党、社会党、工会、商工会等团体在内的民主团体水灾对策协议会，从灾害发生后立即行动起来。现在，这种人民救灾的联合组织，已经在受灾地区普遍建立起来。各地人民的募捐运动也已广泛开展起来。
    日本共产党在救灾中的活动，博得了日本广大人民的称赞。灾害发生后，日本共产党中央成立了灾害对策委员会，各级党组织和广大党员都走在救灾运动的前面。例如，在其他政党没有组织医疗队前，共产党第一个派出医疗队到灾区去。在任何一家报纸记者没有到灾区以前，日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”记者就排除一切困难，率先深入灾区采访，为灾民请命。直到现在为止，“赤旗报”每天都向各界报道灾区的真实情况，呼吁各界救灾，并揭露岸信介政府的阴谋活动。日本共产党中央派到灾区去的救护卡车，也是民间派出的第一批卡车。尤其可贵的是许多家在灾区的共产党员，显示了舍己为人的崇高品质，他们不顾自己挨饿受冻，而去组织工人、农民和市民为克服灾害而斗争。在他们的倡导和组织下，不少地方的灾民组织起来，成立了“受灾者同盟”，同岸信介政府忽视灾民利益的政策进行顽强的斗争。例如，名古屋市受灾严重的筑三町有一个叫高羽忠美的共产党员，他不顾一家八口缺吃少穿的困难处境，四出奔走，了解灾民的情况，组成了筑三町的“受灾者同盟”。这个灾民组织提出“保障应急的住宅”、“迅速整理流失土地，以便重整家园”等十四项要求，同区公所进行了强硬的交涉。
          ×　×　×
    目前，日本国会临时会议正在开会，救济台风灾害问题已经成了进步民主力量同岸信介反动政府进行斗争的焦点之一。这是一桩与上百万人的身家性命攸关的大事。在岸信介政府的统治下，这个问题能否得到多少有利于人民的解决，则有待于日本人民和民主力量加强斗争。（附图片）
    不，人民并没有在消极地等待“救济”。看，他们行动起来了，提出了嘹亮的口号：“把军备拨款拿来救济受灾的人民！”
    台风过去快一个月了，反动当局只是忙着扩军备战，对善后救灾工作迟迟不进行。这里，母女三人呆望着水淹后的家，何时才能重新安居下来？
