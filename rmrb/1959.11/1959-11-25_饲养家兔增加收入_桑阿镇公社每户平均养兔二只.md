Raising Domestic Rabbits Increases Income
Sang'a Township Commune Averages Two Rabbits Per Household

(Reported by this newspaper) The Sang'a Township Commune in Guan County, Shandong Province, while achieving an all-round leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, has paid attention to the breeding and reproduction of domestic rabbits. On the basis of 1,600 rabbits last year, the number of rabbits raised and bred has now increased to more than 29,600, averaging more than two rabbits per household.

In the past ten months, the entire commune has sold a large number of rabbit skins and rabbit meat to the state, with the commune's income reaching more than 40,000 yuan. This money was used to purchase 175,000 jin of chemical fertilizer and more than 1,100 small farm tools.

Raising rabbits has not only increased the actual income of the commune and its members, improved the lives of the members, but also powerfully promoted the development of agricultural production. (Attached picture)

    桑阿镇公社每户平均养兔二只
    本报讯　山东冠县桑阿镇公社，在农林牧副渔全面跃进的同时，注意了家兔饲养繁殖工作，在去年一千六百只的基础上，现已增养和繁殖到两万九千六百余只，每户平均两只以上。
    全社在十个月的时间，先后出售给国家大量兔皮和兔肉，公社收入达四万多元。用这项款购买化肥十七万五千斤，小农具一千一百余件。
    养兔不仅增加了公社和社员实际收入，改善了社员生活，而且也有力的促进了农业生产的发展。（附图片）
