Xinhua News Agency, 15th: In their final friendly match in Beijing this afternoon at the Xiannongtan Stadium, the Soviet "Tomsk Residents" football team lost to the Beijing football team with a score of 0-3. All three goals were scored in the second half. More than 20,000 spectators watched this brilliant match.

The Beijing team's advantage was achieved in the second half. They adjusted their lineup, replacing left inside forward Sun Fucheng, whose foot injury had just healed, with Fang Renqiu, strengthening the forwards' passing coordination. They also improved on shortcomings from the first half, such as not being aggressive enough in contesting the ball and attacking too much from the center, where the visiting team's defense was tighter. In the second half, every player was willing to pester and snatch, and passed the ball quickly. The two wingers, Wang Lu and Cong Zheyu, were very active. This dispersed the visiting team's defensive strength, making the home team more proactive and increasing the number of shots on goal (the Beijing team took twelve shots in the first half and thirteen in the second half, while the visiting team took ten shots in the first half and nine in the second half).

The Beijing team scored their first goal just four minutes into the second half. This goal was scored by the nineteen-year-old newcomer and center forward Zhang Kunyue, who headed in a cross, beating the visiting team's goalkeeper Likhanov. After conceding the goal, the physically fit visiting team tried hard to counterattack. Their attacks were mostly launched from the sidelines by the two wingers, the very capable ball-controlling brothers A. Chintsov (No. 11) and V. Chintsov (No. 7). However, they were repeatedly thwarted by the marking and interception of the home team's defenders Wang Kebin, Wang Defa, and Sun Baorong, forcing them to use more long-range shots, which reduced the threat to Beijing team's goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu.

The Beijing team's three defenders and midfielders Zhang Jingtian and Nian Weisheng also intercepted the ball when contesting with the visiting team and passed the ball to the fast-running wingers to launch quick attacks. As a result, in the thirtieth and fortieth minutes of the second half, they scored two more goals by utilizing crosses in the visiting team's goal area. One goal was scored by Wang Lu, who received a cross from Cong Zheyu from the right side. The other goal was scored by right inside forward Chen Jialiang, who, after receiving a cross from Wang Lu from the left side, lightly flicked the ball into the net from three or four meters away, taking advantage of the visiting team's goalkeeper's misjudgment in rushing out to save. The visiting team's brave and tenacious playing style left a deep impression on the audience. They will soon leave Beijing to visit and compete in Wuhan and Guangzhou.

    北京足球队3比○胜“托木斯克人”队
    新华社15日讯　苏联“托木斯克人”足球队今天下午在北京先农坛体育场举行访问北京的最后一场友谊比赛中，以零比三败给了北京足球队。三个球都是在下半场攻入的。有两万多名观众观看了这场精采的球赛。
    北京队今天的优势是在下半场取得的。他们调整了阵容，由方纫秋替下了脚伤刚愈不久的左内锋孙福成，加强了前锋的传递配合，同时也改进了上半场争球不够积极，又多从客队防守较严的中路进攻等缺点，下半场每个队员都肯缠肯抢、传球快速，左右两个边锋——王陆和从者余十分活跃，这样就分散了客队的防守力量，显得主动，射门次数比客队增多。（北京队上半场共射门十二次、下半场十三次，客队上半场十次、下半场九次）。
    下半场比赛刚进行了四分钟，北京队就攻入了第一个球。这个球是由十九岁的新手、中锋张坤岳接到传中球后，用头顶入客队里哈诺夫把守的球门的。体力良好的客队失球后，极力反攻，攻势多由两个边锋、控制球能力很强的阿·钦佐夫（十一号）和弗·钦佐夫（七号）兄弟从边线发动。但在主队后卫王克斌、王德发、孙宝荣等人的盯人阻截下，屡攻不成，迫得他们只好多用远射攻门，这样就减弱了对北京队守门员张俊秀的威胁。
    北京队的三个后卫和前卫张京天、年维泗在同客队抢球时截得球后，也多传球给奔跑快速的边锋发动快攻，结果在下半场第三十和第四十分钟时，又两次利用传中球，在客队球门区内射入两个球。其中一个球是王陆接到从者余由右边传来的球后，射入球门的。另一个球是右内锋陈家亮接到王陆从左边传来的球，在离球门三、四米处乘客队守门员跑出扑球落空的机会，轻拨入网的。客队的勇猛、顽强的踢球风格，给观众留下了深刻的印象。他们即将离北京先后到武汉、广州访问比赛。
