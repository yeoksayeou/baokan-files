    Coordinating with Rural Production, Vigorously Develop Rural Spare-Time Education
    After the people's communes were established in China's vast rural areas, the trend in rural production development is becoming increasingly rich in content and complex in technology. In addition to developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, the communes must also develop industry. Now, the Party Central Committee is calling on the people of the whole country to realize the technological transformation of agriculture as soon as possible, to mechanize, irrigate, chemicalize, and electrify agriculture. This requires the vast number of farmers to have higher political, cultural, and technical levels, and requires a large number of outstanding technical personnel and management cadres. The purpose of organizing farmers to participate in learning is to improve their cultural and technical levels and to raise their political awareness to meet the needs of various rural construction undertakings. Chairman Mao has long told us: "Raising the political and cultural level of the masses through cultural and educational work is of extreme importance for the development of the national economy." Facts have proved that by learning to improve the political, cultural, and technical level of farmers, we can give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of farmers in production labor, improve production technology, improve labor productivity, and increase the output of various agricultural and sideline products. At present, there are fewer illiterate people among young and middle-aged farmers than in the past, but there are still relatively few people with a junior elementary school level, and not many people with a secondary school education level. This problem must be solved in the process of realizing the technological transformation of agriculture, which requires rural illiteracy elimination and spare-time education to move faster, vigorously carry out illiteracy elimination, run farmers' spare-time education, and continue to improve farmers' political, technical, and cultural level.
    Eliminating illiteracy at a high speed is not only an urgent need for economic construction, but also completely possible, as has been proved by the fact that the Great Leap Forward in illiteracy elimination last year. Last year, the elimination of illiteracy and spare-time education set off an unprecedented mass learning movement. Nearly 100 million young and middle-aged people participated in literacy learning, and 50 million people got rid of illiteracy. In addition, tens of millions of people participated in various spare-time schools. The number of students enrolled last year, the length of time, the magnitude of the achievements, and the richness of the experience were all unprecedented. After a year of illiteracy elimination last year, the illiteracy situation in China has changed greatly, greatly shortening the process of illiteracy elimination. At present, there are still more than 80 million illiterate people among young and middle-aged people in China. However, among the existing illiterate people, tens of millions of people are already semi-literate, and the rest have learned some characters, and there are only a few people who do not know a single character. That is to say, as long as we make great efforts and work diligently, except for a few areas, the task of eliminating illiteracy can be basically completed nationwide in the next two or three years.
    The current time is a very favorable time for rural areas to carry out illiteracy elimination and spare-time education. The people's communes have embarked on a solid and sound development path, agricultural production continues to leap forward, and cadres and the masses have gained experience in large-scale organization of learning. In particular, after studying the relevant documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses has been mobilized, and the work of illiteracy elimination and spare-time education has achieved new development. According to recent incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 50 million people participating in learning across the country, and in some places, a mass learning upsurge has initially formed. From their personal experience, farmers have felt the urgent need for culture and technology. They said: "Mechanization and electrification cannot be achieved without culture," "Technology is a treasure, and you cannot learn it without culture." We should seize this great opportunity in this winter and next spring, make great efforts to maintain the momentum of continuous leap forward in illiteracy elimination and spare-time education, and develop forward without stopping. Areas that have not eliminated illiteracy should do everything possible to carry out illiteracy elimination; after eliminating illiteracy, all those who have the conditions to learn should be mobilized and organized to enter spare-time primary schools to learn, in order to gradually popularize spare-time primary education; for those who have completed spare-time primary education, they should also receive spare-time secondary education and continuously improve their political, cultural and technical level. At present, spare-time primary and secondary education has the dual task of improving the political, cultural, and technical level of farmers and training technical personnel and management cadres, and must be given sufficient attention and vigorously developed.
    Farmers' illiteracy elimination and spare-time education is a part of the entire education cause, and illiteracy elimination and spare-time education must also implement the Party's education policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. That is to say, illiteracy elimination and spare-time education must serve the continued leap forward of agriculture. Years of experience have proved that learning combined with production will be successful and welcomed by the masses; otherwise, it will be unsuccessful and unpopular. The Great Leap Forward in illiteracy elimination and spare-time education in 1958 emerged under the situation of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, and learning climaxes were formed in various places during the busy farming season. This shows that learning is also possible during the busy farming season. This is a new and successful experience. Why can we also learn during the busy farming season? It is because learning is well combined with production and promotes production. There are three main aspects to learning closely combined with production: First, the learning organization is combined with the production organization. The learning organization follows the production organization, where the production is, where the learning is. The leader of the production organization is also the head of the learning organization, which makes it easy to grasp production with one hand and learning with the other. This winter and next spring, various places will vigorously engage in water conservancy construction and other "five winters" movements. We should make good arrangements for the learning of the masses based on this situation. In particular, water conservancy projects are large-scale operations and collective labor, which is more conducive to organizing learning. The Party committee of the water conservancy construction site must lead this work well and make unified arrangements for labor and learning. As long as the arrangements are appropriate, learning will not only not hinder project construction, but will help improve labor productivity. Rural work departments, water conservancy departments, Communist Youth League organizations, and education departments should all vigorously assist. The second aspect of learning closely combined with production is that the teaching content is suitable for the needs of production, and learning is for practical application. Political education should be closely integrated with the central work, publicize the Party's policies and guidelines, and improve the political awareness of the masses. Cultural education should be combined with production, politics, and life, and oppose being divorced from production and politics, "for culture for the sake of culture" and "for education for the sake of education." Technical education should be combined with production, doing which line, learning which line, and directly serving production. The third aspect of learning closely combined with production is that the learning time is well coordinated with the production time. That is to say, the time for production, learning, and spare-time activities should be unified and reasonably arranged so that learning and production are not affected. In short, in this regard, we should earnestly implement the principle: "Learn more when not busy, learn less when slightly busy, and learn flexibly when very busy." In order to combine with production, the methods and methods of learning can be diverse. Various places have gained many specific experiences, especially the experience of organizing learning during the Great Leap Forward in agriculture last year, which is very rich. Summarizing and promoting these experiences can make our work more complete and healthier.
    With the development of the rural economy, on the one hand, requirements are put forward for politics, culture, and technology to cultivate new types of farmers; on the other hand, conditions are created for farmers to generally improve their cultural level. For example, after the rural people's communes, they set up canteens and nurseries in a big way, and actively created favorable conditions for the learning of young and middle-aged women who were burdened with heavy housework. Those who only see one side of the contradiction between learning and production, and cannot see the other side of unity, mutual promotion, and mutual promotion, will of course run into walls. Our agricultural production is developing more and more, and the people's communes are emitting unparalleled power. They will put forward higher requirements for culture and will create more favorable conditions. We can now see this path very clearly.
    Farmers' spare-time education is the education cause of hundreds of millions of farmers. It should be carried out by mass movement and mass work methods. Right-leaning opportunists oppose mass movements and also oppose the mass movement of farmers' spare-time education. Facts speak louder than words. China's farmers' spare-time education has achieved great achievements through mass movement methods. To carry out illiteracy elimination and farmers' spare-time education at high speed, we must adhere to the mass line and mobilize the learning enthusiasm and school-running enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of farmers. To this end, we must carry out propaganda and mobilization work in a big way to enable the vast number of farmers to grasp the Party's education policy and the great significance of farmers' spare-time education. At the same time, we should also adopt mass line working methods such as holding activist meetings, on-site meetings, cultivating typical examples, setting up pacesetters, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, grasping both ends and leading the middle, and organizing inspections and evaluations. After the movement is launched, we must further enable the movement to continue to develop fully and healthily. This requires being good at combining the blitz learning with regular learning. After the blitz learning, do not rise and fall sharply, but learn constantly and continuously. Therefore, it is necessary to follow up with consolidation work, constantly encourage the masses' enthusiasm for learning, improve learning conditions, and improve the learning system, so that everyone can always maintain revolutionary vigor, overcome difficulties, and make learning continuous, so as to achieve "evergreen in all seasons."
    We have now entered the winter season. This winter and next spring are a decisive juncture for completing the task of eliminating illiteracy in the next two or three years. Various places should seize the favorable opportunity this winter and next spring, mobilize all young and middle-aged farmers who can participate in learning, and those who can participate in teaching, and take various effective measures to vigorously cultivate and solve spare-time teachers. We should also carefully solve the textbooks and necessary material equipment. Party committees, people's committees, and Party organizations of people's communes and production teams at all levels should actively deploy this work, earnestly lead it, strengthen supervision and inspection, summarize experiences in a timely manner, discover problems, solve them in a timely manner, and strive to launch a mass learning upsurge and deeply develop the cultural revolution!

    配合农村生产　大力发展农村业余教育
    在我国广大农村人民公社化以后，农村生产发展的趋势，是内容越来越丰富，技术越来越复杂；公社除了发展农、林、牧、副、渔以外，还要发展工业。现在，党中央又号召全国人民要尽快地实现农业技术改造，使农业机械化、水利化、化学化和电气化。这就更加要求广大农民具有更高的政治和文化技术水平，要求大量出色的技术人员和管理干部。组织农民参加学习的目的，就是为了提高他们的文化和技术水平，提高他们的政治觉悟，以适应农村各项建设事业的需要。毛主席早已告诉我们说：“用文化教育工作提高群众的政治和文化的水平，这对于发展国民经济同样有极大的重要性。”事实证明，通过学习提高农民的政治、文化、技术水平，就可以充分发挥农民生产劳动的积极性和创造性，提高生产技术，提高劳动生产率，增加各种农副产品的产量。目前在青壮年农民中文盲比过去少了，但是，具有高小水平的人还比较少，具有中等学校教育水平的人也不多。这个问题必须在实现农业技术改造的过程中加以解决，这就要求农村扫除文盲和业余教育快马加鞭，大力进行扫除文盲，举办农民业余教育，继续提高农民的政治、技术和文化水平。
    高速度地扫除文盲，既是经济建设的迫切需要，也是完全可能作到的，这已被去年扫盲大跃进的事实所证实。去年，扫除文盲和业余教育掀起了一个前所未有的群众性学习运动。青壮年有近亿的人参加了识字学习，摆脱文盲状态的达五千万人。另外还有几千万人参加了各种业余学校学习。去年入学人数之多，持续时间之长，成绩之大，经验之丰富，都是空前的。经过去年一年的扫除文盲，我国文盲情况起了很大变化，大大缩短了扫盲的进程。目前，我国青壮年中还有八千多万文盲。但是，现有文盲中，有几千万人已经是半文盲，其余的人也都或多或少地识了一些字，一字不识的人是少数。这就是说，只要鼓足干劲，经过踏踏实实地努力，除个别地区外，全国在今后两三年内基本上能够完成扫盲任务。
    当前是农村开展扫除文盲和业余教育非常有利的时机。人民公社已经走上巩固的、健全发展的道路，农业生产继续跃进，干部和群众都有了大规模组织学习的经验。特别是学习党的八届八中全会有关文件以后，干部和群众的积极性已被调动起来，扫除文盲和业余教育工作有了新的发展。据最近不完全的统计，目前全国约有五千多万人参加了学习，有的地方已经初步形成了群众性的学习热潮。农民从他们的切身体验中，已经感到对文化、技术的迫切需要。他们说：“机械化、电气化，没有文化不能化”，“技术是个宝，没有文化学不了”。我们应该抓紧今冬明春这个大好时机，鼓足干劲，使扫除文盲和业余教育保持不断跃进的气势，不停顿的向前发展。没有扫除文盲的地区千方百计的进行扫盲；在扫除文盲之后，凡是有条件学习的人，都应该动员组织已脱盲的人进入业余初等学校学习，以期逐步普及业余初等教育；对于已经受完业余初等教育的人，还要使他们受到业余中等教育，不断地提高他们的政治文化技术水平。当前业余初等、中等教育负有提高农民的政治、文化、技术水平和培养技术人员和管理干部双重任务，必须予以足够重视，必须大力发展。
    农民扫除文盲和业余教育是整个教育事业的一部分，扫盲和业余教育也必须贯彻执行党的教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育和生产劳动相结合的方针。这就是说，扫盲和业余教育必须为当前农业继续跃进服务。多年来的经验证明：学习同生产结合得好，就会获得成功，受到群众欢迎；反之，就会遭受失败，不受群众的欢迎。1958年的扫盲和业余教育的大跃进，是在工农业生产大跃进的形势下出现的，而且各地都是在农忙季节形成学习高潮的。这说明在农忙季节里也是可以学习的。这是一条新的、成功的经验。为什么在农忙季节里也能学习呢？就是因为学习同生产结合得好，并且促进了生产。学习密切结合生产，主要有三个方面：一是学习组织同生产组织结合。学习组织跟着生产组织走，生产在哪里，学习在哪里。生产组织的领导人也是学习组织的负责人，这样就便于一手抓生产，一手抓学习。今冬明春各地大搞水利建设等“五冬”运动，应该根据这种情况，很好地安排群众的学习，特别是水利工程，都是大兵团作战，集体劳动，更加有利于组织学习。水利工地的党委要很好地领导这一工作，对劳动和学习作统一的安排。只要安排得当，学习不但不会妨碍工程建设，反而有利于提高劳动生产率。农村工作部门、水利部门、共青团的组织和教育部门都要大力协助。学习密切结合生产的第二个方面，是教学内容适合生产的需要，学以致用。政治教育应该密切结合中心工作，宣传党的方针政策，提高群众的政治觉悟。文化教育应该结合生产、政治和生活进行，反对脱离生产、脱离政治，“为文化而文化”、“为教育而教育”。技术教育应该结合生产进行，干哪一行，学哪一行，直接为生产服务。学习密切结合生产的第三个方面，是学习时间同生产时间配合好。这就是说要把生产、学习和业余活动的时间作统一的合理的安排，使得学习和生产两不误。总之，在这方面，应当切实贯彻执行这样的原则：“不忙多学，小忙少学，大忙机动学”。为了结合生产，学习的方式方法，可以多种多样。各地已经取得很多具体的经验，特别是去年农业大跃进中组织学习的经验，是非常丰富的。总结和推广这些经验，就可以使我们的工作更完满、更健康。
    随着农村经济的发展，一方面对政治、文化、技术提出了要求，要培养新型的农民；另一方面又为农民普遍提高文化水平创造了条件。例如农村人民公社化以后，大办食堂、大办托儿所，积极为家务劳动负担重的壮年妇女的学习创造了有利条件。那些只看到学习和生产矛盾的一方面，看不见二者统一的、互相推动、互相促进的另一面，这些人当然要碰壁的。我们的农业生产愈益发展，人民公社发出无比的威力，对文化会提出更高的要求，也就会创造更有利的条件。这条道路，现在，我们看得很明显了。
    农民业余教育是几亿农民群众的教育事业，应该用群众运动、群众工作的方法进行。右倾机会主义分子反对群众运动，也反对农民业余教育的群众运动。事实胜于雄辩，我国的农民业余教育，用群众运动的办法获得了巨大的成就。我们要高速度地进行扫盲和农民业余教育工作，必须坚持群众路线，把几亿农民的学习积极性和办学积极性调动起来。为此，就必须大张旗鼓地进行宣传鼓动工作，使党的教育方针和农民业余教育的重大意义，为广大农民所掌握。同时，还应该采取召开积极分子会议，现场会议，培养典型，树立标兵，学先进、赶先进，抓两头带中间，组织检查评比等群众路线的工作方法。运动开展起来之后，还要进一步使运动持续不断地饱满地健康地发展下去，这就要善于把突击性学习和经常性学习结合起来，在突击学习之后，不要大起大落，而要经常不断的学习。因此必须紧跟着进行巩固工作，不断地鼓舞群众的学习热情，改善学习条件，健全学习制度，使大家经常保持革命干劲，克服困难，使学习持续不断，做到“四季常青”。
    现在已进入冬令季节。今冬明春是今后两三年内完成扫盲任务有决定意义的关头。各地应该抓紧今冬明春的有利时机，把所有能够参加学习的青壮年农民，和能够参加教学的人都动员起来，要采取各种有效措施，大力培养解决业余教师，对于教材以及必要的物质设备，也应当认真加以解决。各级党委、人民委员会和人民公社、生产队的党组织，对于这一工作都应该积极加以部署，认真把它领导起来，要加强督促检查，及时总结经验，发现问题，及时解决，为掀起群众性的学习热潮，深入发展文化革命而努力！
