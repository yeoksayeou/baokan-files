Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 21st—More than 10,000 mechanical workers at Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation are accelerating the manufacture of spare parts and the repair of equipment to create conditions for a sustained leap forward in steel production this winter and next spring.

In September and October, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Machinery General Factory manufactured more than 1,500 tons of spare parts, more than double the total volume of spare parts manufactured in the first half of this year. At present, units such as Daye Iron Mine, Wulongquan Limestone, Dolomite Mine, Beneficiation Plant, Sintering Plant, Coking Plant, Ironmaking Plant, and Steelmaking Plant have a certain amount of spare parts and various parts for important equipment in reserve. The tuyere water jackets of the two blast furnaces and the grates that are heavily consumed on the sintering machine also have spare parts in storage. This year, the Machinery General Factory will also manufacture more than 400 tons of spare parts for production in the first quarter of next year, including coke oven pushing rods, acid-resistant pumps for the coking plant, and mud guns for the ironmaking plant, which are all in production. Material preparation and wooden molds have also begun for many other spare parts.

In terms of equipment maintenance, in addition to a group of workers responsible for routine equipment maintenance, mass equipment maintenance activities have also been launched. Production workers are meticulously maintaining equipment in their respective positions, ensuring "keeping it clean, paying attention to lubrication, using it reasonably, and checking it regularly," so the mechanical utilization rate is relatively high. Since the No. 1 blast furnace of the Ironmaking Plant was put into production, there have been no major mechanical equipment damage accidents, and the equipment utilization rate of the two blast furnaces has often remained above 98%. The utilization rate of the electric shovels and drilling machines at Daye Iron Mine used to be only 70%. After establishing a system of regular inspections and planned maintenance, the utilization rate of these machines has been between 80% and 90% in recent months.

This year, with the commissioning of a series of main projects such as the No. 2 blast furnace, No. 3 coke oven, No. 1 and No. 2 open-hearth furnaces, beneficiation plant, and sintering plant, the task of manufacturing spare parts and maintaining equipment has become increasingly heavy. In order to adapt to this situation, Wuhan Iron and Steel has strengthened its equipment maintenance and spare parts manufacturing capabilities since the second quarter, determining that the Machinery General Factory, Power General Factory, and the auxiliary repair workshops of various factories and mines should focus on manufacturing spare parts and repairing equipment, and establishing a flexibly dispatched professional repair team. The Party Committees of the Machinery General Factory and Power General Factory have also strengthened the leadership of spare parts production, grasping the plan by day, by ten-day period, and by month. The two directors of the Machinery General Factory once led workshop directors, production section chiefs, and workers to visit the ironmaking plant, coking plant, and sintering plant to understand the production process and solicit workers' opinions on spare parts manufacturing. Now, the employees of the Machinery General Factory and the Power General Factory have achieved the ability to manufacture whatever other production plants and mines need.

    武钢积极为持续跃进创造条件
    维修设备　制造备品
    新华社武汉21日电　武汉钢铁公司一万多名机械工人加速制造备品和维修设备，为今冬明春钢铁生产的持续跃进创造条件。
    在9、10两月，武钢机械总厂共制造了一千五百多吨备品，比今年上半年备品制造总量多一倍。现在，大冶铁矿、乌龙泉石灰石、白云石矿、选矿厂、烧结厂、焦化厂、炼铁厂、炼钢厂等单位，都储备有一定数量重要设备的备品和各种零件。两座高炉的风口水套，烧结机上大量消耗的篦子，也有备品储存。今年内，机械总厂还将为明年第一季度的生产制造四百多吨备品，其中如焦化厂的推丝杆、耐酸泵和炼铁厂的泥炮等，都在生产，其他许多备品也已经着手备料和作木模。
    在设备维修方面，除了有一批工人担任经常性的设备维修工作以外，还开展了群众性的设备维修活动，生产工人们都在自己的岗位上精心地维护设备，作到“保持清洁、注意润滑、合理使用、定期检查”，因此机械利用率较高。炼铁厂从一号高炉投入生产以来，没有发生过重大的机械设备损坏事故，两座高炉的设备利用率经常保持在98％以上。大冶铁矿的电铲和穿孔机，过去利用率只有70％，在建立定期检查和计划检修制度以后，这几个月的利用率都在80％到90％之间。
    今年，武钢随着二号高炉、三号焦炉、一号和二号平炉、选矿厂、烧结厂等一系列主体工程投入生产，备品制造和设备维修的任务愈来愈繁重。为了适应这一形势，武钢从第二季度以来就加强了设备维修和备品制造的力量，确定机械总厂、动力总厂和各厂矿的辅助修理车间以制造备品和维修设备为主，并且建立了调度灵活的专业检修队伍。机械总厂和动力总厂的党委也加强了备品生产的领导，按日、按旬、按月抓计划。机械总厂的两位厂长曾率领车间主任、生产股长和工人，到炼铁厂、焦化厂、烧结厂参观访问，了解生产过程，征求工人们对备品制造的意见。现在，机械总厂、动力总厂的职工已经做到了其他生产厂矿需要什么就制造什么。
