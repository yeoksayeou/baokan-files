Xinhua News Agency, November 18th, Rangoon Dispatch: The Burmese National United Front issued a statement on the 16th supporting Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal for resolving the Sino-Indian border issue.

The statement said that it is appropriate for the two countries to resolve this issue through peaceful negotiations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, which aims to seek peace in the world and Asia.

The statement said that preventing further armed conflict on the Sino-Indian border is in line with this spirit. Therefore, in order to prevent conflict between the two countries, we support the principle of armed forces retreating respectively and establishing a demilitarized zone.

The statement added that the second point included in Zhou Enlai's proposal is that the Prime Ministers of the two countries should hold talks as soon as possible to discuss the Sino-Indian border issue and other issues related to Sino-Indian relations. We strongly support this proposal. It is only natural and desirable that arrangements be made to prevent armed conflict as mentioned above, and then the Prime Ministers of the two countries hold talks to determine the border between the two countries once and for all.

The statement pointed out that imperialists are taking every action to intensify the tension between the two countries and undermine the harmony between the two peoples by taking advantage of the situation.

The statement said that the people of Burma hope that the Sino-Indian border issue can be resolved peacefully and amicably soon. We sincerely hope that the talks will be successful.

Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: The Communist Party organs in Finland, Sweden, and Denmark welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal in his letter to Nehru for resolving the Sino-Indian border issue.

    Finnish "People's News" Points Out
  China Has Been Doing Its Utmost to Prevent Conflict
The Finnish Communist Party and People's Democratic League organ "People's News" published an editorial on the 11th stating, "China has been doing its utmost to prevent conflict and achieve a peaceful resolution."

The editorial pointed out that Indian troops have forcibly entered areas under Chinese administrative jurisdiction. In India, there are undoubtedly some groups playing a strange role at this time in provoking conflict. In addition, there are people abroad who are determined to create turmoil and worsen relations between India and China. In Asia, there are all kinds of speculators who can only live in American arms aid, military provocations, and the Cold War. Moreover, the United States' Asian policy has not changed in the slightest.

The editorial pointed out that Premier Zhou Enlai, in a letter to Prime Minister Nehru, suggested that the two Prime Ministers hold talks in the near future to resolve the border conflict, and suggested that the armed forces of both sides withdraw from the disputed border line.

The editorial said of Nehru, "If he wishes, it is entirely possible for him to get rid of the influence of the most fanatical nationalists and disputants."

The editorial emphasized: "The border conflict between India and China should be urgently removed from the agenda, because the international Cold War groups are using these events to maintain the mood of the ice age."

    Swedish "New Daily" Editorial Says
  Premier Zhou's Proposal Can Serve as a Basis for Resolving Disputes
The Swedish Communist Party organ "New Daily" published an editorial on the 11th stating that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal "should be able to become a good basis for resolving the Sino-Indian border dispute."

The editorial pointed out, "China emphasizes the importance of achieving a final solution to avoid border conflicts. Such conflicts can only be used by the enemies of the friendship between the two great nations." The editorial expressed regret over the reported negative reaction of the New Delhi "political circles" to Premier Zhou's proposal. It pointed out, "It is difficult to understand what is unfavorable to India in China's proposal?"

The editorial emphasized that Premier Zhou's proposal "should be able to make the final settlement of the Sino-Indian border issue possible, thereby eliminating the dangerous tension in Asia."

    Danish "Land and People"
  Refutes the So-Called Claim That the Withdrawal of Troops by Both Sides is Detrimental to India
The Danish Communist Party organ "Land and People" pointed out on the 11th that Indian reactionaries and the United States are attempting to counteract the good impression created by China's proposal among ordinary people. The editorial criticized Nehru's claim that China cannot be allowed to "invade" India, pointing out that this shows that he is taking a stance supporting those in India who are keen on border incidents.

"Land and People" refuted the claim that the withdrawal of troops by both sides by 20 kilometers is detrimental to India. It said that China has never recognized the McMahon Line, but is still willing to use this line as a baseline for troop withdrawal, which shows that China's proposal is fair.

    缅甸、芬兰、瑞典和丹麦公众舆论欢迎周总理建议
    希望维护中印友谊　和平解决边界问题
    缅甸民族团结阵线发表声明
    支持中印建立非武装地带原则
    新华社18日讯　仰光消息：缅甸民族团结阵线16日发表声明，支持周恩来总理关于解决中印两国边界问题的建议。
    声明说，两国根据五项和平原则和旨在谋求世界和亚洲和平的万隆精神通过和平谈判来解决这个问题是适当的。
    声明说，希望防止在中印边界上再发生武装冲突是符合这种精神的。因此，为了防止两国发生冲突，我们支持武装部队各自后撤并建立一个非武装地带的原则。
    声明又说，周恩来的建议中包括的第二点是，两国总理早日举行会谈来讨论中印边界问题以及有关中印关系的其他问题。我们十分坚决地支持这项建议。建议在作出安排使武装冲突像上面所说那样不再发生以后，由两国总理举行会谈以便一劳永逸地确定两国之间的边界，这是十分自然的和人们所希望的。
    声明指出，帝国主义者正在利用局势采取一切行动来加剧两国之间的紧张关系，破坏两国人民的和睦。
    声明说，缅甸人民希望，中印边界问题将能和平友好地迅速地获得解决。我们真诚地希望会谈取得成功。
    新华社17日讯　芬兰、瑞典和丹麦的共产党机关报欢迎周恩来总理在给尼赫鲁的信件中所提出的解决中印边界问题的建议。
    芬兰“人民新闻”指出
  中国一直尽最大努力制止冲突
    芬兰共产党和人民民主联盟机关报“人民新闻”11日发表社论说，“中国一直尽最大努力来制止冲突和实现和平解决。”
    社论指出，印度的军队以武力进入了属于中国行政管辖的地区。在印度，无疑有一些集团在这个时候起着一种奇怪的作用，来挑起冲突。此外，国外有人一心要制造动乱和恶化印度和中国之间的关系。在亚洲，有各种各样的投机者，他们只有在美国军备援助、军事挑衅和冷战中才能生活。此外，美国的亚洲政策没有丝毫改变。
    社论指出，周恩来总理在给尼赫鲁总理的一封信中建议两国总理在最近举行会谈以解决边境冲突，并建议双方军队从有争论的边界线撤退。
    社论在谈到尼赫鲁时说，“如果他希望的话，他完全有可能摆脱最狂热的民族主义者和争论者的影响”。
    社论强调说：“应当迫切把印度和中国的边境冲突从议事日程上除掉，因为国际冷战集团在利用这些事件来保持冰冻时期的情绪。”
    瑞典“新日报”社论说
  周总理建议可作为解决纠纷基础
    瑞典共产党机关报“新日报”11日发表社论说，周恩来总理的建议“应当能够成为解决中印边界纠纷的良好基础”。
    社论指出，“中国强调取得最后解决的重要性，以避免边界冲突。这种冲突只能被两个伟大民族友谊的敌人所利用。”社论对据报道的新德里“政界”对周总理建议的消极反应表示遗憾。它指出，“很难理解，中国的建议究竟对印度有什么不利？”
    社论强调说，周总理的建议“应当能够使中印边界问题的最后解决成为可能，从而消除亚洲危险的紧张局势”。
    丹麦“国土与人民报”
  驳所谓双方撤兵对印不利的说法
    丹麦共产党机关报“国土与人民报”11日指出，印度反动派和美国企图抵消中国建议在普通人民中所造成的良好印象。社论批评尼赫鲁声称不能允许中国“侵略”印度这种说法，指出这说明他采取支持印度热衷于边境事件的人士的态度。
    “国土与人民报”驳斥关于双方撤兵二十公里对印度不利的说法。它说，中国从来没有承认麦克马洪线，但仍愿以这条线为基线撤兵，说明中国的建议是公平的。
