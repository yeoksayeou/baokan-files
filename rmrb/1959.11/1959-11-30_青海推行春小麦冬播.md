Xinhua News Agency, Xining – Qinghai Province has begun winter sowing of spring wheat. As of now, some state-owned farms and people's communes in the western region, where the ground freezes earlier, have already sown more than 40,000 mu of spring wheat; the people's communes in the warmer eastern region are actively preparing for sowing.

The winter sowing of spring wheat in Qinghai Province was successfully tested by several state-owned farms in the Qaidam Basin in 1956. Later, several counties in the eastern agricultural area also gradually succeeded in trial planting. The results of several years of trial planting in these areas have proven that, as long as the sowing period is properly controlled, winter sowing of spring wheat not only has the characteristics of rapid emergence, vigorous growth, more tillers, large and full ears, and strong resistance to adversity, but also, under the same conditions and measures, winter sowing yields even greater increases than spring sowing.

Qinghai Province has abundant land but a sparse population and a long cold season. Promoting winter sowing of spring wheat can alleviate the situation of many farm tasks, tight labor, and livestock power in the spring, and can also free up some water to ensure the water needs of spring-sown crops.

All localities have done a relatively meticulous job in the winter sowing of spring wheat. As early as after the autumn harvest, many trial planting units carefully studied and summarized winter sowing experiences, studied winter sowing technical measures, and formulated winter sowing plans. All localities also attached great importance to sowing quality during sowing. The land was all ploughed in autumn, irrigated in winter, and fully fertilized. Various localities have also implemented measures such as selecting fine varieties and reasonable close planting.

    青海推行春小麦冬播
    新华社西宁讯　青海省开始冬播春小麦。截至目前，西部地区地冻较早的一部分国营农场和人民公社已经播种了春小麦四万多亩；东部较暖地区各人民公社正在积极准备播种。
    青海省春麦冬播是1956年由柴达木盆地的几个国营农场试验成功的。以后，东部农业区的几个县也逐步试种成功。这些地区试种几年的结果证明：只要播种期掌握适当，春麦冬播不仅具有出苗快、生长茁壮、分蘖多、穗大粒饱、抗逆力强等特点，并且在相同的条件和措施下，冬播比春播增产幅度更大。
    青海省地多人少，寒冷季节长，春播时间短促，推行春麦冬播，可以缓和春季农活多、劳力和畜力紧张的状况，还可以腾出一部分水量，保证春播作物的用水需要。
    各地对春麦冬播工作都做得比较细致。早在秋收后，许多试种单位就认真学习和总结了冬播经验，研究冬播技术措施，订出冬播计划。播种中各地又十分重视播种质量。土地全部经过秋翻、冬灌，施足肥料。各地并实现了精选良种、合理密植等措施。
