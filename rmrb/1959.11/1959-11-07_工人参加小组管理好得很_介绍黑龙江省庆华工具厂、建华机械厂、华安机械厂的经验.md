    It's Excellent that Workers Participate in Group Management
    ——Introducing the Experiences of Qinghua Tool Factory, Jianhua Machinery Factory, and Hua'an Machinery Factory in Heilongjiang Province
    The Qinghua Tool Factory, Jianhua Machinery Factory, and Hua'an Machinery Factory in Heilongjiang Province share a common characteristic: they have done an excellent job in worker participation in group management, leading to continuous improvement in enterprise management and continuous leaps in production.
    Since these three factories implemented the "two participations and one reform" experience in early 1958, they have further clarified the scope of responsibilities for worker participation in group management this year. They have strengthened the mass management work with group leaders and worker functionaries as the backbone, thereby closely integrating professional management with mass management, and making the enterprise management work further adapt to the needs of large-scale mass movements and the Great Leap Forward in production. Now, these three factories have developed from organizing workers to participate in the daily production management of groups to participating in the economic and technical management of groups. The scope of responsibilities for worker participation in group management mainly includes the following aspects: In terms of production management, it primarily involves arranging the group's monthly operation plan and technical measures according to the workshop plan and by work procedures; specifically arranging the daily production progress; and being responsible for the group's internal production scheduling work. In terms of technical management, it primarily involves self-inspection and mutual inspection of product quality, implementing process discipline; innovating technology targeting key points; strengthening machine tool maintenance, safekeeping, and repair work; implementing technical safety systems; and organizing qualified groups to participate in partial process design work. In terms of economic management, it primarily involves preparing the group's monthly plan for raw materials, tools, and low-value consumables, being responsible for the receiving, issuing, and safekeeping of these items, keeping original records, and carrying out group economic accounting.
    Worker participation in group management not only cultivates and improves workers' ability to participate in daily group management, but more importantly, it enhances workers' sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs. Workers reflect: "You don't know the cost of firewood and rice until you manage the household; you don't know the high and low until you calculate the accounts." Old worker Tan Zhenyuan wrote a ditty saying: "In the past, we didn't pay attention, scrap material was thrown all over the place, and sweeping was careless, resulting in garbage. Now we pick up scrap material, no matter how big or small, every inch of iron becomes an inch of gold, and everyone cares. Picking up a little every day adds up to tens of thousands of catties over time." One night, worker material handler Guo Yi discovered that the weather was suddenly changing and it was about to rain. He ran to the factory and found tarpaulins to cover the valuable materials stored in the open air, avoiding losses. This new trend of caring for state property and "taking the factory as home" has been further promoted among the broad masses of workers through worker participation in group management. Through worker participation in partial process design, not only has the technical level of workers been improved, but also the wisdom of the masses has been more effectively concentrated, playing a significant role in accelerating the design progress and improving the design quality. Taking the Qinghua Tool Factory as an example, due to worker participation in the partial process design of new products, the tasks that used to take the professional departments a year to complete were accomplished in less than two months.
    In order to adapt to the needs of workers participating in group production, technology, and economic management, these three factories have readjusted and divided the production groups. After several rectifications, the group management work of these three factories has basically become regularized and systematized. Their daily specific practices are: First, organize all workers in the group to prepare the group plan. At the beginning of each month, after receiving the plan issued by the workshop, the production group leader first convenes the relevant worker functionaries to prepare the group's monthly operation plan. Each worker functionary proposes various plans required for production, which are summarized by the accountant and submitted to all workers in the group for discussion, and then submitted to the workshop for approval. Second, do a good job in daily management and promptly resolve problems in group production. The daily management activities of the group are mainly carried out through pre-shift and post-shift meetings. At the pre-shift meeting, the production group leader arranges the daily production tasks and organizes the workers to prepare for production. At the same time, the worker technical safety officer conducts relevant technical safety education; each worker functionary, according to their respective business, does a good job in production, man-hour, machine-hour records, and attendance registration, waste product statistics, etc. At the post-shift meeting, the daily production situation is checked, problems in production are studied and resolved, and the production tasks for the next shift are arranged. Third, do a good job in group economic activity analysis. Hold a group economic activity analysis meeting once a week to summarize the group management work in the past week. The accountant presents the completion of various indicators of the group in the current week, and then organizes the workers to discuss and propose improvement measures. Through the group economic activity analysis, these three factories not only make the daily business work of the group worker functionaries more specific, enabling them to rationally use manpower and material resources and continuously reduce production costs, but also improve the group management level. Fourth, do a good job in group competition and evaluation. Hold a group competition and evaluation meeting once a month. At the meeting, conduct monthly economic activity analysis, check and summarize group management work, and evaluate the winners and levels of the group workers' competition, so that labor competition and group management are closely integrated.
    While implementing worker participation in group management, these three factories have improved the workshop's leadership over the groups.
    The production and technical cadres of the workshop functional groups generally divide their work based on products or workshops, implement on-site office work, specifically responsible for guiding the work of the groups, helping the groups arrange monthly plans, assisting the group leader in holding group production scheduling meetings and organizing product matching work, and assisting the groups in handling production technical problems in a timely manner. The full-time cadres of the workshop are directly linked to the worker functionaries according to the division of business, and help the production groups establish a set of business management systems. Through the business guidance and connection of the workshop full-time cadres to the worker functionaries, professional management and mass participation in group management form an integrated whole in terms of business and management. At the same time, two forms of meetings are adhered to: one is a regular operation meeting, attended by the group leader and relevant full-time cadres of the workshop. The meeting mainly summarizes and checks the work of the previous week and deploys the production tasks for the current week. The workshop functional group holds business meetings twice a month with the participation of full-time cadres and group worker functionaries to check and deploy business management work and conduct business competition and evaluation. The other is an irregular professional meeting. Through these meetings and full-time cadres' in-depth and timely understanding of the situation, it is not only conducive to improving work, but also allows workers to receive timely business guidance, which is conducive to improving the group management level.
    In order to help the groups do a good job in management, the workshop functional group also actively helps the groups do a good job in pre-production preparation, simplifies business procedures, and at the same time, professional cadres promptly help the groups solve production or management problems by participating in labor and planting "experimental fields."
    These three factories pay great attention to the training of workers in order to continuously improve their business capabilities. In terms of business training, the main focus is on the workshop, assisted by the business departments of the factory, adopting regular, non-detached short-term business training classes and irregular "one-thing-one-teaching" methods. In terms of technical training, the technical level and management ability of workers are mainly improved through absorbing workers to participate in design, participating in technical management, holding professional training classes, and signing various technical mutual assistance contracts. Currently, 70% of the group leaders in these three factories have reached the level of past foremen, 20% of the worker functionaries have reached the level of similar professional cadres, and more than 80% of the worker functionaries have mastered the business more proficiently. Facts have proved that workers can not only do a good job in production, but also have unparalleled wisdom in participating in group management.

    工人参加小组管理好得很
    ——介绍黑龙江省庆华工具厂、建华机械厂、华安机械厂的经验
    黑龙江省庆华工具厂、建华机械厂、华安机械厂有一个共同的特点，这就是：工人参加小组管理的工作做得好，企业管理水平不断提高，生产不断跃进。
    自1958年初这三个厂推行了“两参一改”的经验以后，他们在今年又进一步明确规定了工人参加小组管理的职责范围，加强了以小组长和工人职能员为骨干的群众性的管理工作，从而使专业管理与群众管理密切地结合起来，使企业的管理工作进一步适应了大搞群众运动和生产大跃进的需要。现在，这三个厂已经由过去组织职工参加小组日常生产管理，发展到参加小组的经济和技术管理。工人参加小组管理的职责范围，在生产管理方面主要是，根据车间计划，按工序编排小组的月作业计划和技术措施；具体安排生产日进度；负责组内生产调度工作。在技术管理方面，主要是自检互检产品质量，贯彻工艺纪律；针对关键，革新技术；加强机床维护、保管、检修工作；贯彻技术安全制度；组织有条件的小组参加部分工艺设计工作。在经济管理方面，主要是编制小组每月的原料、工具和低值易耗品的计划，负责领取、发放、保管等工作，作好原始记录，开展小组经济核算。
    工人参加小组管理，不仅培养和提高了工人参加小组日常管理的能力，更重要的是增强了工人主人翁的责任感。工人反映：“不当家不知柴米贵，不算账不知高和低。”老工人谭振源写打油诗说：“过去不注意，料头扔满地，扫地一马虎，结果变垃圾。动手捡废料，不论大和小，寸铁变寸金，人人要关心，一天捡一点，日久成万斤。”工人材料员郭义有一天夜间发现天气突变要下雨，他就跑到厂里，找苫布把露天放的贵重材料盖好，避免了损失。这种关心国家财产“以厂为家”的新风尚，通过工人参加小组管理，进一步在广大职工中发扬起来。通过工人参加部分工艺设计，不但提高了工人的技术水平，而且更有效地集中了群众智慧，对加快设计进度和提高设计质量起了很大作用。以庆华工具厂为例，由于工人参加新产品部分工艺设计，不到两个月，就完成了过去专业部门一年才能完成的任务。
    这三个厂为了适应工人参加小组生产、技术、经济管理的需要，重新调整和划分了生产小组。经过几次整顿，这三个厂的小组管理工作已基本上经常化和制度化了。他们的日常具体作法是：第一、组织全组工人编制小组计划。每月初小组在接到车间下达的计划后，首先由生产小组长召集有关的工人职能员编制小组月的作业计划，各工人职能员分别提出生产所需要的各项计划，由核算员汇总，交全组工人进行讨论，然后送车间审批。第二、做好日常管理，及时解决小组生产中的问题。小组的日常管理活动，主要是通过班前、班后会来进行。在班前会上，由生产小组长安排当日生产任务，组织工人做好生产前的准备工作，同时由工人技术安全员进行有关技术安全教育；各工人职能员根据自己分管的业务，做好产量、工时、台时记录和考勤登记、废品统计等。在班后会上，检查当日生产情况，研究解决生产中的问题，安排下一班的生产任务。第三、做好小组经济活动分析。每周召开一次小组经济活动分析会议，总结一周来小组管理工作，核算员提出本周小组各项指标完成情况，然后组织工人讨论，提出改进措施。这三个厂通过小组经济活动分析，不仅使小组工人职能员的日常业务工作更加具体，能合理地使用人力物力，不断降低生产成本，而且还提高了小组管理水平。第四、做好小组竞赛评比工作。每月召开一次小组竞赛评比会。在会上进行月的经济活动分析，检查总结小组管理工作，评比出小组工人的竞赛优胜和等级，使劳动竞赛和小组管理紧密地结合起来。
    这三个厂在实行工人参加小组管理的同时，改进了车间对小组的领导。
    车间职能组的生产、技术干部，一般都以产品或工房为对象进行分工，实行现场办公，具体负责指导小组的工作，帮助小组安排好月计划，协助组长开好小组生产调度会议和组织产品配套工作，及时协助小组处理生产技术问题。车间专职干部都按业务分工和工人职能员直接挂钩指导，帮助生产小组建立了一套业务管理制度。通过车间专职干部对工人职能员在业务上的指导和联系，使专业管理和群众参加小组管理在业务上、管理上形成了一体。同时，还坚持了两种会议形式：一种是定期的作业会议，小组长和车间有关专职干部参加，会议主要是总结检查上周工作和部署本周生产任务。车间职能组每月召开两次有专职干部和小组工人职能员参加的业务会议，检查和部署业务管理工作，进行同业务竞赛评比。另一种是不定期的专业会议。通过这些会议和专职干部深入及时的了解情况，既有利于改进工作，工人又及时得到业务指导，有利于提高小组管理水平。
    为了帮助小组作好管理工作，车间职能组还积极帮助小组做好生产前的准备工作，简化了业务手续，同时，专业干部通过参加劳动和种“试验田”的形式，及时帮助小组解决生产或管理上的问题。
    这三个厂非常注意对工人的培训工作，以不断提高工人的业务能力。在业务培训方面，主要以车间为主，厂部业务科室协助，采取定期不脱产的短期业务训练班和不定期的“一事一教”的方法。在技术培训上，主要是通过吸收工人参加设计，参加技术管理，举办专业训练班，签订各种技术互助合同等形式来提高工人的技术水平和管理能力。这三个厂现在已经有70％的小组长达到过去工长的水平，有20％的工人职能员达到了同类专业干部的水平，有80％以上的工人职能员较熟练地掌握了业务。事实证明，工人不仅能够搞好生产，在参加小组管理上也有着无比的智慧。
