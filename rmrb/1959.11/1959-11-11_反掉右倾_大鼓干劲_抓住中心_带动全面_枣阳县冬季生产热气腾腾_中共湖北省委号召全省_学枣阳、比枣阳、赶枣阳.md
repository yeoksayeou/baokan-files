    Oppose Rightism, Beat the Drums for Exertion, Grasp the Center, Drive the Overall
    Winter Production in Zaoyang County is in Full Swing
    The Hubei Provincial Party Committee Calls on the Entire Province to "Learn from Zaoyang, Compare with Zaoyang, Catch Up with Zaoyang"

    (Reported by this newspaper) Zaoyang County, Hubei Province, has fully leveraged the superiority of the people's commune, employed comprehensive planning, strengthened leadership, grasped the center, and driven the overall work method, launching a vigorous mass movement and setting off a roaring high tide of winter production.

    From early September to mid-October, Zaoyang County deeply plowed 1.8 million mu of land, with a general depth of six inches to one foot. It completed the autumn sowing task on 1.8 million mu of land within half a month, an expansion of 300,000 mu compared to last year. The characteristics of this year's autumn sowing are early action, fast progress, and good quality. An average of 120 dan of base fertilizer was applied per mu, with approximately 20 jin of seeds sown, achieving row planting with close spacing, balanced fertilization, and eliminating the phenomenon of unhulled seeds being sown and broadcast seeding. In conjunction with deep plowing and autumn sowing, 1.23 million mu of land were leveled, and 640,000 mu of land were transformed into garden fields. After land leveling, 130,000 plots of land were transformed into 7,500 plots, connected into large areas, with small plots of 100 to 200 mu and large plots of 2,000 to 3,000 mu or more; simultaneously, more than 80,000 barren fields and open spaces were leveled, and more than 200,000 unnecessary small field ridges, pits, depressions, and ditches were dug up and filled, expanding the cultivated area by 100,000 mu. This not only expanded the cultivated area and facilitated cultivation management, but also laid a good foundation for mechanized farming. In conjunction with deep plowing, 110,000 mu of dry land were converted into paddy fields, 130,000 mu of wasteland were reclaimed, 526 highways and roads were built, totaling 5,250 li in length, and 5,604 field operation roads were built, totaling more than 7,800 li in length, basically achieving automobile access for every team, horse-drawn cart access for every village, and flatbed cart access for every field. In conjunction with fertilizer accumulation, more than 7,000 small and medium-sized water conservancy projects were built, with more than 3,300 projects already completed, involving 5 million cubic meters of earthwork, 70 million dan of pond mud dug, 20.4 billion dan of soil fertilizer accumulated, and 220 million dan of fertilizer delivered. The annual grain storage has reached more than 150 million jin, exceeding the target by 7.6 million jin, cotton storage has reached more than 85,000 dan, oil storage has reached 30,000 dan, and the county's sideline production (grain and cotton processing, transportation, etc.) has generated an income of 8.95 million yuan.

    The formation of the comprehensive winter production high tide in Zaoyang County is the result of constantly overcoming right-leaning thoughts in the struggle between two kinds of ideology and two roads, and it is the glorious victory of implementing the General Line, relying on the people's communes, and launching mass movements in a big way. A large part of Zaoyang is hilly land with poor soil quality, traditionally known throughout the province for its low yields. Could this situation be quickly changed? There were two different ideas: one group believed that strengthening leadership, fully leveraging the superiority of the commune, and boldly mobilizing the masses could quickly change the backward situation; another group with right-leaning conservative ideas believed that the conditions were poor and it could only be done slowly. The Zaoyang County Party Committee criticized the right-leaning conservative thought of "doing it slowly." As early as June after the wheat harvest, it formulated a plan for this year's deep plowing area, depth, time, and labor arrangement, and boldly mobilized the masses to discuss it. At the end of August, when deeply plowing the land, they encountered a continuous drought of more than a month, and the ground was cracked, causing some people to have fears and difficulties. The Zaoyang County Party Committee immediately launched a large-scale ideological education movement on socialism and the General Line throughout the county, conducting large-scale airing of views, debates, and discussions centered on deep plowing. About 300,000 people participated in this debate, writing a total of 400,000 big-character posters. Right-leaning conservative thoughts were further criticized, and the soaring enthusiasm of the masses was mobilized.

    In order to develop agricultural production at high speed, the guiding ideology of the Zaoyang County Party Committee has always been to look forward everywhere and look forward in everything. They have consistently implemented the spirit of continuous revolution in every production link. The specific method is: according to the production season, seize every link and make preparations for the next step as early as possible. For example, the preparatory work for water conservancy construction began as early as autumn plowing and autumn planting. Many communes have established professional teams to go to the water conservancy construction sites first to clean up the sites. Due to thorough preparation, they immediately switched to the water conservancy front after the wheat was planted.

    The leadership experience of "grasping the center and driving the overall" in the winter production movement in Zaoyang County and the soaring enthusiasm of the masses in this county have aroused widespread attention throughout Hubei Province. Recently, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee issued a call to the entire province to "Learn from Zaoyang, Compare with Zaoyang, Catch Up with Zaoyang."

    In the past month, people from all over the province have been constantly visiting Zaoyang.

    Also, Zaoyang County is striving for a bumper summer harvest next year with the spirit of continuous revolution.

    The quality of autumn planting in Zaoyang County this year is better than any other year, so some people have developed complacency and relaxation. In view of this situation, the County Party Committee launched a major inspection of planting quality, and timely reversed the mood of complacency and relaxation. The inspection content includes: whether the four corners and four sides of the land are planted; whether the ditches are opened to standard; whether the soil blocks are finely arranged; whether the fertilizer is sufficient, etc. The slogan put forward by the people of the county is "Eliminate the three types of seedlings before emergence."

    Some production teams that originally thought that the planting was good and there were no problems, after visiting, debating, and calculating, all checked their complacency and immediately organized special teams to replant and process. Many cadres and commune members of the Yizhuang Production Team of Wudian Commune originally thought that the inspection was superfluous. They said, "You will drop two grains of rice even when eating, how can planting wheat be like embroidery?" The Party branch organized more than 200 commune members from the entire team to look, discuss, and calculate accounts in the field, and found that there were more than 500 mu in the entire team where the ditches were not well opened or the four sides and four corners were not planted. The Magang Production Team of Juwan Commune had better planting quality this year, but after raising the inspection standards, there were still more than 600 mu of unqualified planting out of the more than 3,900 mu that had been planted. The deputy secretary of the Party branch of the team immediately led more than 50 people to form three groups, specializing in processing and replanting. Combining this major inspection of planting quality, the people's communes have further established and improved the field management system for overwintering crops.

    反掉右倾  大鼓干劲  抓住中心  带动全面
    枣阳县冬季生产热气腾腾
    中共湖北省委号召全省“学枣阳、比枣阳、赶枣阳”
    本报讯　湖北枣阳县充分发挥人民公社优越性，运用全面规划，加强领导，抓住中心，带动全面的工作方法，大搞群众运动，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的冬季生产高潮。
    从9月上旬到10月中旬，枣阳县深耕土地一百八十万亩，一般的深度达到六寸到一尺。半月内完成了一百八十万亩地的秋播任务，比去年扩大三十万亩。今年秋播的特点，是行动早、进度快、质量好。每亩平均施底肥一百二十担，下种二十斤左右，作到了条播密植，平衡施肥，消灭白子下地和撒播现象。结合深耕、秋播，平整土地一百二十三万亩，六十四万亩土地实现了园田化。经过土地平整，十三万块田地变成七千五百块，并且连结成片，小片一、二百亩，大片两、三千亩以上；同时平整了荒场、空场等有八万多处，挖掉填平不必要的小地埂、坑、凹、沟渠二十多万条，扩大耕地面积十万亩。这样不仅扩大了耕地面积，便于耕作管理，同时也为机械化耕作打下了良好的基础。结合深耕，旱地改水田十一万亩，开荒十三万亩，修公路、马路五百二十六条，全长五千二百五十华里，修田间作业道五千六百零四条，全长七千八百多里，基本上实现了队队可以通汽车、庄庄通马车、田间通板车。结合积肥兴修中、小型水利七千多处，已完成三千三百多处，土方五百万方，挖塘泥七千万担，积土肥二百零四亿担，送肥二亿二千万担。全年粮食入库已达一亿五千多万斤，超过任务七百六十万斤，棉花入库八万五千多担，油料入库三万担，全县副业生产（粮棉加工、采运等），收入八百九十五万元。
    枣阳县全面冬季生产高潮的形成，是在两种思想、两条道路的斗争中，不断战胜右倾思想的结果，是贯彻总路线、依靠人民公社、大搞群众运动的光辉胜利。枣阳大部是岗地，土质坏，向来以低产闻名全省。能不能迅速改变这种面貌呢？有两种不同的思想：一种人认为，加强领导，充分发挥公社优越性，放手发动群众，是可以迅速改变落后面貌的；另一种有右倾保守思想的人认为，条件差，只能慢慢来。中共枣阳县委批判了“慢慢来”的右倾保守思想，早在今年6月麦收之后，就把今年深翻的面积、深度、时间和劳力安排作出规划，放手发动群众讨论。8月底深翻土地时，遇到了持续一个多月的大旱，地干的发裂，部分人有了畏难思想。枣阳县委立即在全县范围内开展了大规模的社会主义和总路线的思想教育运动，以深翻为中心进行大鸣、大放、大辩论，参加这场辩论的达三十万人左右，共写大字报四十万张，右倾保守思想受到了进一步的批判，群众的冲天干劲被发动起来了。
    为了高速度地发展农业生产，中共枣阳县委的指导思想一直是处处向前看，事事向前看，他们把不断革命的精神始终如一地贯彻在每个生产环节中。具体作法是：根据生产季节，抓住每一个环节，尽早地作好下一步的准备工作。例如，兴修水利的准备工作早在秋耕秋种中就开始了，许多公社都成立了专业班子，先到水利工地，打扫场地。由于准备工作周到，所以在小麦种完，就立即转入水利战线。
    枣阳县在冬季生产运动中，“抓住中心，带动全面”的领导经验和这个县群众的冲天干劲，已经引起湖北全省各地的普遍注意。最近，中共湖北省委向全省发出“学枣阳、比枣阳、赶枣阳”的号召。
    近一月来，全省各地前往枣阳参观访问的人，天天不断。
    又讯　枣阳县以不断地革命精神，全力争取明年夏季大丰收。
    枣阳县今年秋种质量比任何一年都好，有些人因此产生了自满松劲情绪。县委根据这种情况，发动了一次播种质量大检查，及时扭转了自满松劲情绪。检查内容包括：地的四角四边是否种到；沟开得合不合标准；土块整得细不细；肥料足不足等。全县人民提出的口号是“把三类苗消灭在出苗前”。
    有些原来认为播种得好、没有问题的生产队，经过参观、辩论、算账以后，都检查了自己的松劲情绪，立即组织专门班子补种、加工。吴店公社易庄生产队许多干部和社员原认为检查是多余的，他们说，“吃饭也要掉两粒米，种麦还能像绣花一样？”党支部组织全队二百多个社员到地里边看、边讨论、边算账，发现全队沟没有开好的或四边四角没有种到的共有五百多亩。琚湾公社马岗生产队今年播种质量较好，但把检查标准提高后，在已播的三千九百多亩中，还有六百多亩种的不合格。队的党支部副书记立即带领五十多人，组成三个小组，专门负责加工、补种。各人民公社结合这次播种质量大检查，进一步建立和健全了越冬作物的田间管理制度。
