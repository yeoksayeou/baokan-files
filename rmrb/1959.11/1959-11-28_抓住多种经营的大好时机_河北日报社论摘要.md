Seize the Great Opportunity for Diversified Economy
——Abstract of Hebei Daily Editorial

    On November 26th, the Hebei Daily published an editorial entitled "Fight to Overfulfill the Output Value Plan for Diversified Economy Ahead of Schedule." The abstract of the editorial is as follows:

    Vigorously developing diversified economy is an important way to increase the income of commune members and strengthen the collective economy of the communes. One of the important aspects of the superiority of communes over advanced cooperatives is that they can break through the scope of a single economy and achieve a comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Only by developing a diversified economy can we fully utilize the resources of the commune, enable everyone to give full play to their expertise, obtain greater wealth in the shortest possible time, increase the income of commune members, and expand the accumulation of the commune.

    To do a good job in diversified economy, we must adhere to the five-character principle of "high, good, low, many, and big." "High" means high output, improving production efficiency, and increasing products; "Good" means good quality, meeting needs, and achieving high output and good quality; "Low" means low cost, and everything must be thrifty; "Many" means increasing the quantity and variety of commodity production as much as possible; "Big" means big income and expanding the public accumulation of the commune. Achieving these five characters is a manifestation of conscientiously implementing the general line in diversified economy and a correct method for developing diversified economy production at high speed.

    At present, the development of diversified economy in various regions is still uneven, and the potential for developing diversified economy is still very large. Areas with well-developed diversified economy may generate the idea of "production reaching the top," saying that there is nothing to develop; areas with relatively poor diversified economy still circulate "difficulty theory" and "condition theory." These all affect the further development of diversified economy. If we can do a good job in diversified economy during the busy agricultural seasons of spring, summer, and autumn, then we should do an even better job in diversified economy after entering winter. Because on the one hand, the suddenness of farm work is not so strong, and many laborers, especially auxiliary laborers, have more time to engage in this production; at the same time, the raw materials for many handicrafts and sideline production are also more abundant than in spring, summer, and autumn. It can be said that this winter and next spring is a great opportunity to vigorously develop diversified economy.

    To vigorously develop diversified economy, we must first closely focus on and serve the continued leap forward in next year's production. The overall purpose of our diversified economy is to promote the common high tide of the entire national economy, while also increasing the income of communes and commune members. Vigorously developing water conservancy construction is the prominent central task this winter and next spring, and diversified economy should first serve water conservancy construction, and vigorously develop the production of baskets, bricks, hoes, shovels, mats, ropes, lime, cement, and other items. A large part of diversified economy products are export goods. Therefore, diversified economy should be subordinate to the national plan and vigorously produce according to the needs of national exports, so that we vigorously supply whatever exports need, as long as we can produce it. Of course, we must also consider the needs of the market, because daily necessities are mostly produced in diversified economy production.

    Secondly, to vigorously develop diversified economy, we must strengthen the leadership of collective production. In particular, we must help poor production teams develop diversified economy in a planned way, in order to promote the common economic high tide between teams within the commune and make everyone rich. Developing diversified economy is a way to increase the income of commune members and an important measure to further consolidate the commune system. We must remember that all economic activities of the commune must be conducive to the socialist direction, guiding commune members to see the great prospects of the collective economy. Some people believe that there is no need to particularly emphasize the leadership of collective production in developing diversified economy, which is wrong. Of course, small-scale and scattered production that is not convenient for collectives to engage in should still be allowed for commune members themselves, provided that it does not affect collective production, and the commune and teams should do their best to help.

    Thirdly, to do a good job in diversified economy, we must also promote the spirit of cooperation, and agriculture, commerce, and transportation must be closely integrated, and production, transportation, and sales must be grasped together. That is to say, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the agricultural front, the financial and trade front, and the transportation front must be twisted into a single rope, unify their thinking, clarify their goals, and work together to promote the high-speed development of diversified economy.

    抓住多种经营的大好时机
    ——河北日报社论摘要
    11月26日河北日报以“为提前超额完成多种经营产值计划而战”为题，发表社论。社论摘要如下：
    大搞多种经营，是增加社员收入，壮大公社经济的重要门路。公社所以比高级社优越，其中重要的一条就是能突破单一经济的范围，使农、林、牧、副、渔全面飞跃发展。只有发展多种经济，才能充分利用公社的资源，使所有的人发挥特长，在最短期内取得更大的财富，增加社员收入，扩大公社积累。
    要搞好多种经营，必须坚持“高、好、低、多、大”五个字的原则。高，就是要产量高，提高生产效率，增加产品；好，就是质量要好，合乎需要，做到产量高质量好；低，就是成本低，一切要勤俭；多，就是要多多增加商品生产的数量和品种；大，就是要收入大，扩大公社公共积累。实现了这五个字，就是在多种经营上认真贯彻执行总路线的表现，是高速度发展多种经营生产的正确方法。
    目前各地多种经营开展得还不平衡，发展多种经营的潜力还很大。多种经营搞得好的地区，可能产生“生产到顶论”的思想，说什么没啥发展了；多种经营比较差的地区，仍流传着“困难论”、“条件论”。这些都影响着进一步搞好多种经营。如果说春、夏、秋三个农忙季度能够搞好多种经营，那么进入冬季以后，就更应当搞好多种经营。因为一方面农活的突击性不那么强，许多劳力特别是辅助劳力，有了更多的时间从事这一生产；同时许多手工业、副业生产的原料，也比春夏秋季充足。可以说，今冬明春是大搞多种经营的大好时机。
    大搞多种经营，首先必须紧紧围绕和服务于明年的生产继续跃进。我们搞多种经营的总目的，是为了促进整个国民经济的共同高涨，同时又能增加公社和社员的收入。大搞水利建设是今冬明春突出的中心任务，多种经营首先就要为水利建设服务，应当大搞筐、砖、镐、锨、席、绳、石灰、水泥等项生产。多种经营产品很大一部分是出口物资。因此，多种经营应当服从国家计划，按照国家出口的需要大力生产，作到出口需要什么，只要我们能生产的，就要大力供应什么。当然，我们还要考虑到市场的需要，因为日常生活的用品，多出在多种经营生产方面。
    其次，大搞多种经营，必须加强对集体生产的领导。特别是要有计划地帮助穷生产队搞好多种经营，以利公社内部队与队之间的经济共同高涨，大家富裕。搞多种经营，是增加社员收入的一种方法，是进一步巩固公社制度的重要措施。我们必须记住，公社的一切经济活动都必须有利于社会主义方向，引导社员看到集体经济的伟大前景。某些人认为搞多种经营，无需特别强调集体生产的领导，这是错误的。当然，那些不便于集体搞的小宗、零星生产，在不影响集体生产的条件下，还应允许社员自己搞，社、队并应尽力帮助。
    第三，要搞好多种经营，还必须大兴协作之风，农业、商业、交通运输要紧密结合，产、运、销要一起抓。也就是说，要在党委的统一领导下，把农业战线、财贸战线和交通运输战线拧成一股绳，统一思想，明确目标，共同为促进多种经营高速度发展而努力。
