    Automatic Production Line
    The Dalian Machine Tool Plant recently completed an automated production line for gear processing. This automated production line can process various gears with diameters ranging from 80 mm to 200 mm, producing one every one and a half minutes. Its efficiency is three to six times higher than ordinary processing methods, and its precision reaches level two. Its annual output is 170,000 gears, which can equip 30,000 cars or 15,000 tractors.

    自动生产线
    大连机床厂最近建成了一条齿轮加工自动化生产线。这条自动生产线能加工直径八十毫米到二百毫米的各种不同规格的齿轮，每一分半钟就能生产一个，效率比普通加工方法高三倍到六倍，精度达到二级。它的年产量是十七万只齿轮，可以装备三万辆汽车或一万五千台拖拉机。
