Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, November 1st: The Weishan Hub Diversion Project on the Yellow River has fully commenced, building upon the successful completion of the first and second phases. A workforce of 200,000 is participating in this project.

The Weishan Hub Project on the Yellow River is one of China's key projects for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River's flood hazards and developing its water resources. Once this project is fully completed, it will permanently protect tens of millions of people in the lower reaches of the Yellow River from flood damage and provide perennial irrigation benefits to 40 million mu of fertile land. The diversion project is the critical component of the entire Weishan Hub Project, grand in scale. In addition to the diversion dam, it includes a diversion channel project, the construction of a Shunhuang Ship Lock, a sand prevention gate, and three lake inlet gates, as well as the Dongping Lake embankment and dike reinforcement project. In total, it requires the excavation of 14.6 million cubic meters of earth, the quarrying and laying of 600,000 cubic meters of stone, and the pouring of 90,000 cubic meters of concrete. The main purpose of this phase of the project is to cut off the turbulent Yellow River near Huangzhuang, Weishan, Shandong Province, forcing the surging water to be discharged downstream through the diversion gates, so as to regulate the water level and flow according to people's wishes, making this "dragon," known for its proneness to silting and breaching, obediently serve the people in the lower reaches of the Yellow River.

The Yellow River Diversion Gate of the Weishan Hub first-phase project, which broke ground on May 1st of last year and was completed by the end of September, demonstrated great power in this autumn's drought resistance, with a maximum water diversion flow rate of 3,000 cubic meters per second, irrigating more than 4.4 million mu of land. However, it is still affected by the rise and fall of the Yellow River's water level and cannot fully play its role. The second-phase project, which began in November of last year and was completed on July 15th of this year, involved the construction of a flood control gate with a maximum flood discharge capacity of 8,000 cubic meters per second, but it cannot play its role in controlling floods due to the lack of coordination with a diversion dam. After the diversion project is completed, the already completed Yellow River Diversion Gate, flood control gate, and lake outlet gate from the first and second phases of the Weishan Hub, as well as the Dongping Lake Reservoir with a storage capacity of 4 billion cubic meters, which will be completed at the same time, will be able to fully demonstrate their immense power, eliminating the serious threat of the Yellow River's summer, autumn, and ice floods to Shandong. In the future, in the event of exceptionally large flood peaks and annual ice floods, the huge diversion dam will hold back the floodwaters and force them to flow into the Dongping Lake Reservoir. At the same time, due to the control of the hub project, the water level above the dam will be raised, which can fully exert the effectiveness of Yellow River diversion irrigation and reverse the situation where irrigation is not possible at low water levels. During the dry season of the Yellow River in spring and winter each year, the stored water from the Dongping Lake Reservoir can also be released to regulate the flow in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, fully utilize the Yellow River's water resources, and irrigate more than 40 million mu of land along the river. In addition, it will also enable the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, which historically could not be fully navigable, to cross the Yellow River, allowing smooth water transport. This will play a huge role in the development of China's, especially Shandong Province's, industry and shipping, promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and develop the fishery industry in Dongping Lake.

In order to ensure the success of this phase of the project, the Shandong Provincial Department of Water Resources, in accordance with the instructions of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, convened a construction preparation meeting at the Weishan Engineering Bureau to carefully study the project's construction plan and the mobilization of manpower and materials. A Weishan Hub Project Support Office was established, and more than 150 cadres and more than 500 skilled workers with experience in emergency rescue and dike closure were transferred to directly participate in the construction of the Yellow River diversion closure. The Department of Health transferred 60 medical personnel to strengthen medical and epidemic prevention work at the construction site. Commercial, grain, and transportation departments at all levels are actively taking action, with large quantities of grain, coal, vegetables, and daily necessities being transported to the construction site, and large quantities of timber, steel, cement, and other materials are being shipped in from all over the country.

All employees participating in the diversion project are in high spirits. In the first round of construction, they demonstrated an indomitable determination to conquer. The "Satellite Assault Team" composed of 240 people from the Gulou People's Commune in Linqing City compressed a 40-day plan into three 5-day mini-plans, with the first mini-plan completed 10 hours ahead of schedule. The 110 combatants from the Leiji People's Commune in Xiajin County launched a competition of "heroes against heroes, good men against good men." They put forward the bold declaration of "bringing victory back to the commune and leaving their heroic names in Weishan." The 6,000 civilian workers from Feicheng County, fighting in the Gengshankou Diversion Channel, completed 52,000 cubic meters of earthwork in two days, accounting for 10% of the total planned task. All employees are determined to complete the Yellow River diversion task before the ice flood.

### 山东二十万大军腰斩黄河  位山枢纽截流工程全面开工

    山东二十万大军腰斩黄河
    位山枢纽截流工程全面开工
    新华社济南1日电　黄河位山枢纽截流工程在第一、二期工程胜利竣工的基础上全面开工，投入这一工程的有二十万劳动大军。
    黄河位山枢纽工程是我国根治黄河水害、开发黄河水利的重要工程之一。这一工程全部完成之后，可以使黄河下游的数千万人民永远免除黄水为害，使四千万亩良田得到常年灌溉效益。截流工程是整个位山枢纽工程的关键工程，规模宏大，除截流拦河大坝以外，还包括有引河工程，兴建顺黄船闸、防沙闸各一座，进湖闸三座，以及东平湖围堰和堤防加固工程。总计要挖筑土方一千四百六十万立方米，开山、砌石六十万立方米，浇灌混凝土九万立方米。这期工程的主要目的，是在山东位山黄庄附近，将凶猛的黄河拦腰斩断，迫使滚滚黄水通过拦河闸往下渲泄，以便按照人们的意愿调节水位流量，使这条以善淤善决著称的“蛟龙”，俯首贴耳为黄河下游的人民造福。
    曾在去年5月1日破土开工到去年9月底竣工的位山枢纽第一期工程的引黄闸，在今年秋季抗旱中发挥了巨大的威力，最大引水流量达到了三千秒立方米，灌溉土地达四百四十余万亩，但它仍受着黄河水位涨落的影响，不能充分地发挥作用；第二期工程是去年11月开始到今年7月15日竣工的，这次兴建的拦河闸，最大排洪量达到八千秒立方米，但是由于没有拦河坝的配合，也不能发挥控制洪水的作用。截流工程完成之后，就将充分发挥位山枢纽一、二期工程中已完成的引黄闸、拦河闸、出湖闸以及同时完成的蓄水四十亿公方的东平湖水库的巨大威力，免除黄河伏、秋、凌汛对山东的严重威胁。今后如遇特大洪峰和一年一度的凌汛，就以巨大的拦河闸把洪水拤住，并迫其流入东平湖水库。同时，由于枢纽工程的控制，坝上水位提高，可以充分发挥引黄灌溉的效能，扭转低水位不能灌溉的局面；在每年春、冬黄河枯水季节，还可放出东平湖水库的蓄水，调节黄河下游流量，充分利用黄河水利资源，灌溉沿河四千余万亩土地。此外，还能使我国历史上不能全线通航的京杭大运河穿过黄河，水运畅通；对发展我国特别是山东省工业、航运事业，促进城乡物资交流，以及发展东平湖的渔业，都将起到巨大的作用。
    为了保证搞好这期工程，山东省水利厅根据中共山东省委和省人民委员会的指示，曾在位山工程局召开了施工准备会议，认真研究了工程的施工计划和调动人力、物力的问题。并成立了支援位山枢纽工程办公室，抽调一百五十余名干部和五百余名有抢险堵口经验的技术工人，直接参加了黄河截流合龙的施工；卫生厅抽调六十名医务人员加强工地医疗防疫工作；各级商业、粮食、交通运输部门都在积极行动，大批的粮食、煤炭、蔬菜、日用品运到了工地，大批的木材、钢材、水泥等物资，也正由全国各地陆续运来。
    参加截流工程的全体员工，斗志昂扬。在开工的第一个回合中，就显示出了攻无不克的坚强毅力。临清市古楼人民公社由二百四十人组成的卫星突击队，把四十天的计划压缩在三个五日小段计划里，第一个小段计划已提前十个小时完成，夏津县雷集人民公社的一百一十名战斗员，掀起了“英雄对英雄，好汉对好汉”的竞赛。他们提出了“把胜利带回公社，把英名留在位山”的豪言壮语；战斗在耿山口引河的肥城县六千民工，两天完成土方五万二千余立方米，占全部计划任务的10％。全体员工决心在凌汛前完成黄河截流任务。
