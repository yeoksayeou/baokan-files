    New Material to Replace Steel
    A new type of building material to replace steel – rock cast pipe – has been born!
    This rock cast pipe is wear-resistant, acid-resistant, high-temperature resistant, can withstand acid corrosion, and is also insulating. It can be used as water supply and drainage pipes, as lining castings for ball mills, to make machine platforms and bases, and also as oil pipelines and insulators for transmitting high-voltage electricity. It has such a wide range of uses, yet the cost is only one-third of that of cast iron.
    This advanced technology was successfully trial-produced by staff members of the Shanxi Provincial Architectural Science Research Institute under the leadership of Deputy Chief Engineer Wang Wencui, overcoming difficulties such as no data, no experience, and no equipment. This new product is not only simpler to cast than steel, but also uses diabase, andesite, etc., which are abundant in various places, as raw materials. Wang Wencui introduced their experience at the National Congress of Heroes, and this new type of building material will radiate a strange brilliance on the construction industry front.

    代替钢铁的新材料
    一种代替钢铁的新型建筑材料——岩石铸管诞生了！
    这种岩石铸管耐磨，耐酸，耐高温，能经受酸类腐蚀，又能绝缘。它可以作上下水管，可以作球磨机的里衬铸件，可以制作机器的机台、机座，还可以作石油输送管道和输送高压电的绝缘体。用途这么广，成本却只有铸铁的三分之一。
    这项先进技术，是山西省建筑科学研究所工作人员在副总工程师王文萃领导下克服一无资料、二无经验、三无设备的困难试制成功的。这种新产品不仅铸造方法比钢铁简单，而且是用各地蕴藏丰富的辉绿岩、安山岩等作原料。王文萃在全国群英大会上介绍了他们的经验，这种新型建筑材料将在建筑工业战线放出奇异光彩。
