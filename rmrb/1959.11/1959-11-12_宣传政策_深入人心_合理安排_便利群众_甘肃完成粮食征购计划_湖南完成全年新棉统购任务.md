Gansu Completes Grain Purchase Plan
Hunan Completes Annual Unified Purchase Task for New Cotton

(Our newspaper's report from Lanzhou, November 11th) Gansu Province has already overfulfilled the annual grain purchase task by 12.16% ahead of schedule at the end of October. At the same time, the province's agricultural and sideline livestock products (excluding oilseeds) have also overfulfilled the annual purchase plan by 107.52% ahead of schedule. As of October 31, the amount of grain purchased and stored in the province increased by 176% compared with the same period last year. The quality meets the national standards of dryness, cleanliness, and fullness.

This year, the mass movement for selling grain, cotton, oil, and agricultural and sideline livestock products in Gansu Province has been vigorous, widespread, rapid in progress, and outstanding in achievements. This is the result of giving full play to the superiority of the people's communes under the guidance of the Party's General Line, enabling agricultural production to achieve an all-round bumper harvest; it is also the result of implementing the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, launching the anti-rightist campaign, boosting morale, and vigorously carrying out mass movements. The red banner for completing the task of grain and oil storage and agricultural and sideline product procurement in the province - the vast number of members of the Tianshui Special District, in order to hand over grain early and hand over good grain to support the construction of the motherland, did not miss a single sunny day in terms of drying grain. In terms of labor arrangement, they adopted the method of grasping production and purchase at the same time, closely combining quick harvesting, quick threshing, and quick sales with clean harvesting, clean threshing, and selling good grain, and conscientiously implementing the principle of "overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement." The grain departments throughout the province also simplified warehousing procedures to facilitate the masses and accelerate the warehousing speed.

During the purchase campaign throughout the province, earth loudspeakers, blackboard newspapers, and other means were generally used to deeply publicize the policies of the Party and the government, and to fully inspire the enthusiasm of farmers to hand over and sell their products. Vigorous publicity was given to a series of policies such as "high quality and high price, grading and pricing" and "national acceptance combined with democratic evaluation," making them known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. At the same time, proper arrangements were made for the lives of the commune members. These measures greatly accelerated the progress of procurement.

(Our newspaper's report from Changsha, November 8th) Within less than two months of the new cotton entering the market, Hunan Province launched a vigorous mass movement, accomplished it in one go, and overfulfilled the 1959 annual unified purchase task for new cotton. The purchase volume increased three times compared with the same period last year, and the quality also improved by one grade compared with previous years.

This year, the people's communes in the cotton-producing areas of Hunan Province gave full play to their unparalleled superiority, overcame the drought and severe insect pests that lasted for several months, and achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of cotton. As soon as the cotton was harvested, the people's communes launched cotton selling competitions. All commercial departments adhered to the principle of putting politics in command, relied on party committees at all levels, vigorously carried out the mass movement for purchasing new cotton, and implemented the mass line working methods of separating picking, separating drying, separating ginning, separating storage, and separating sales, and evaluating grades, evaluating length, evaluating lint percentage, and evaluating moisture content, so that the quality of cotton generally improved by one grade compared with last year.

Closely combining purchase, processing, and transfer is also an important factor in Hunan Province's acceleration of the unified purchase of cotton. For example, in the process of unified cotton purchase, the Changde Special District adopted the method of connecting short-distance transportation with long-distance transportation, and combining water, land, and vehicles, so as to achieve rapid purchase, rapid ginning, and rapid transportation. In October alone, more than 130,000 dan of ginned cotton were transferred out, overfulfilling the task of transferring it out.

    宣传政策　深入人心　合理安排　便利群众
    甘肃完成粮食征购计划
    湖南完成全年新棉统购任务
    本报兰州11日电　甘肃省已经提前在10月底超额12.16％完成全年粮食征购任务。同时，全省的农副畜产品（不包括油料）也已经超额107.52％提前完成收购年计划。截至10月31日，全省征购粮入库量较去年同期增加176％。质量合乎国家规定的干、净、饱的标准。
    今年甘肃省的群众性交售粮棉油和农副畜产品运动，来势猛，范围广，进展快，成绩突出。这是在党的总路线照耀下，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，使农业生产获得全面丰收的结果；也是贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，展开反右倾、鼓干劲、大搞群众运动的结果。全省完成粮油入库农副产品收购任务的红旗——天水专区广大社员为了早交粮和交好粮支援祖国建设，在晒粮方面，没有放过一个晴天。在劳力安排方面，采取生产、征购一齐抓，把快收、快打、快交售和收净、打净、售好粮紧紧结合起来，认真贯彻“统筹兼顾，全面安排”方针。全省的粮食部门也简化入库手续，便利群众，加快了入库速度。
    全省在收购运动中，普遍利用土广播、黑板报等深入宣传党和政府的政策，充分启发农民交售产品的积极性。大力宣传“优质优价，分等论价”和“国家验收与民主评级相结合”等一系列的政策，使得家喻户晓，深入人心。同时对社员的生活进行了妥善安排。这些措施大大加快了收购进度。
    本报长沙8日电　湖南省在新棉登场不到两个月的时间内，大搞群众运动，一气呵成，超额完成了1959年度的新棉统购任务，收购量比去年同期增长了三倍，质量也比往年提高一个等级。
    今年，湖南省棉产区各人民公社发挥了无比的优越性，战胜了连续几个月的干旱和严重虫害，取得了棉花大面积丰收。棉花一收摘下来，各人民公社就展开了售棉竞赛。各商业部门坚持政治挂帅，依靠各级党委，大搞新棉采购的群众运动，贯彻分摘、分晒、分轧、分存、分售和评等级、评长度、评衣分率、评水分等的群众路线工作方法，使棉花品质普遍比去年提高一级。
    把收购、加工、调运紧密结合起来，也是湖南省加速棉花统购的一个重要因素。如常德专区在棉花统购过程中，采取了短途运输与长途运输相衔接、水陆车船并进的方法，做到快收、快轧、快运，仅10月份就调出皮棉十三万多担，超额完成了外调任务。
