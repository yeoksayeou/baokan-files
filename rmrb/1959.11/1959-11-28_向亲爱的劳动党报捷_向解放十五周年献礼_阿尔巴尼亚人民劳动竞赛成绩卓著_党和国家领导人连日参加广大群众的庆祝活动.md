Reporting Victory to the Beloved Labor Party, A Gift to the 15th Anniversary of Liberation
    Remarkable Achievements of the Albanian People's Labor Competition
    Party and State Leaders Participate in Mass Celebrations for Days

    (Our Dispatch from Tirana, November 27th, reporter Ge Baozhi) The Albanian working people are dedicating their production achievements to the 15th anniversary of the liberation of their motherland. As the Liberation Day approaches, more and more good news is being reported. According to the latest statistics, 52 enterprises and 6 industrial centers across the country have victoriously completed their annual production plans for 1959 ahead of schedule. This includes 16 tractor stations, 10 local transportation departments, and soil improvement projects in districts like Fieri. Meanwhile, 286 industrial and mining, construction, transportation, commercial, and handicraft enterprises across the country have overfulfilled their October production plans. Seven districts, including Berat, have completed the task of storing fodder and protecting livestock through the winter ahead of schedule.

    Many advanced enterprises, shock brigades, and outstanding workers began their work for 1960 or even 1962 after completing their plans for this year one or two months ago. For example, in the northern region of Shkodër, seven enterprises and fifty-three drivers have already started working on their 1960 plans. During the ten months of this year, the workers in this region overfulfilled the plan and created industrial products worth 104 million leks for the country, an increase of 637 million leks compared to the same period last year. The two largest oil refineries in Albania, the Stalin and Cërik refineries, which produce 300,000 tons of gasoline annually, overfulfilled their October plans by 102% and 116% respectively. The Stalin refinery produced 1,590 tons of gasoline more than originally planned.

    In agriculture, similarly exciting news has been reported. Farmers in the Tirana region have sent good news to the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party about the deep expansion of the agricultural cooperativization movement. As of November 25th, cooperative land in the region accounted for 88% of the region's cultivated land, and 83% of the region's farmers had joined agricultural production cooperatives. So far, 70% of farmers throughout Albania have been organized, and cooperative land accounts for 81.9% of the country's total cultivated land area. This year's sheep breed improvement plan has been successfully completed. According to statistics from artificial insemination stations in the vast countryside, more than 850,000 sheep have undergone artificial insemination, exceeding the original plan by more than 10,000. The Përllat Lezheb State Farm even completed its annual production task two and a half months ahead of schedule. The farm's workers over-produced 230 quintals of wheat, 930 quintals of fruit, 100 quintals of tobacco, and 200 quintals of various vegetables for the country.

    The socialist labor competition launched to welcome the joyous national holiday has unfolded magnificently in every corner of the country. Currently, 821 production teams have responded to the call to strive for the glorious title of "Fatherland Liberation 15th Anniversary Production Team," with the participation of more than 9,300 workers. In the capital Tirana alone, 191 production teams with more than 2,000 people are participating in this movement, including 48 of the best production teams that have already started their work for 1960. They conscientiously fulfill the conditions for striving for this glorious title: producing well and economically, and continuously improving production technology, cultural level, and communist consciousness.

    Rationalization proposals are the wisdom that Albanian workers offer to the country's holiday. In the past nine months, the broad masses of working people have put forward 3,650 rationalization proposals, of which 1,345 alone have saved the country 94 million leks. Old shock workers who have won the title of Socialist Labor Hero for their outstanding initiatives and labor are once again at the forefront in welcoming this great holiday. Socialist Labor Hero, tractor driver Budu Isufi, proposed in 1956 that 5,200 hectares be cultivated without major repairs, saving the country more than 590,000 leks. Today, to welcome the 15th anniversary of National Day, he has proposed to cultivate 10,000 hectares without major repairs. Socialist Labor Hero, driver Behxhet Duda, has made a guarantee that his car will travel 600,000 kilometers without major repairs. Currently, more than 180 drivers in the Shkodër region are participating in the movement for safe driving of 100,000 kilometers without major repairs.

    With only two days left until the holiday, the vast number of Albanian workers are reporting the latest production good news to the beloved Albanian Labor Party, and welcoming the glorious holiday with even greater victories.

    (Our Dispatch from Tirana, November 27th) Various activities have been widely launched throughout Albania to celebrate the upcoming 15th anniversary of the country's liberation. Since November, industrial and mining enterprises, agricultural cooperatives, schools, and institutions in various regions have held report meetings, symposiums, and chats. Youth, Young Pioneers, and women have also held various gatherings, and have widely promoted the achievements of Albania's 15 years of liberation in conjunction with the liberation holidays in their respective regions. Many regions have also held exhibitions of industrial and agricultural achievements, modeling art, photographs, and books. The "Exhibition of Past and Present" held in Vlorë made a clear comparison between the pre-liberation and post-liberation eras with various objects and charts.

    Albanian party and government leaders have also participated in mass celebrations. Albanian Labor Party First Secretary Hoxha celebrated the liberation day of Elbasan with the Young Pioneers of Elbasan, and celebrated their birthdays with fifteen-year-old children. Chairman of the Council of Ministers Shehu held meetings with students, Young Pioneers, and voters in the capital, and gave a report on the achievements of Albania's 15 years of liberation. In order to educate the next generation, trade unions and youth league organizations in many places organized young workers and Young Pioneers to travel to places where guerrilla units fought bravely in the past, so as to learn the heroic fighting spirit of their elders through on-the-spot visits and experiences. At the same time, many agricultural cooperatives also organized farmers to visit factories and cities, and organized joint celebrations for workers and farmers to enhance the connection and friendship between workers and peasants. In welcoming the joyous holiday, residents of many towns and villages celebrated the opening of their own power stations, water stations, and new stores. The people of Kulis region held a grand gathering to celebrate the completion of the region's first radio station. In Doma village, because of the electricity, eight agricultural cooperative members bought new radios on the first day of power supply. Batch after batch of new houses welcomed their new owners. The Cërik oil city alone built 9,000 square meters of new housing.

    向亲爱的劳动党报捷　向解放十五周年献礼
    阿尔巴尼亚人民劳动竞赛成绩卓著
    党和国家领导人连日参加广大群众的庆祝活动
    本报地拉那27日电　记者戈宝植报道：阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民纷纷以生产成就向祖国解放十五周年献礼。解放节日愈来愈近，喜报也愈来愈多。据最新的统计，全国已有五十二个企业和六个工业中心胜利地提前完成了1959年的全年生产计划，其中包括十六个拖拉机站、十个地方交通部门和费里等区的土壤改良工程等。同时，全国已有二百八十六个工矿、建筑、交通、商业和手工业等企业超额完成了10月份的生产计划。贝拉特等七个区提前完成了储存饲料、保畜过冬的任务。
    不少的先进企业、突击小组和优秀工人们早在一、两个月前在完成了今年的计划以后已开始了1960年甚至1962年的工作。例如北部的斯库台区已有七个企业单位和五十三个司机开始了1960年的工作。这一个区的工人们在今年十个月的期间，超额完成了计划并为国家创造了价值一亿零四百万里克价值的工业产品，和去年同一时期相比增加了六亿三千七百万里克。阿尔巴尼亚两个最大的、年产三十万吨汽油的斯大林和柴立克炼油厂，在10月份分别以102％和116％超额完成了10月份计划。斯大林炼油厂并比原计划多生产了一千五百九十吨汽油。
    在农业方面，也同样传来了令人兴奋的捷报。地拉那区的农民已向阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央发出了农业合作化运动深入扩展的喜报。到11月25日为止，该区合作化的耕地已占全区耕地的88％，全区83％的农户都已加入了农业生产合作社。到目前为止，全阿尔巴尼亚已有70％的农户组织了起来，合作社的耕地已占全国耕地总面积81.9％。今年改良羊种的计划已胜利完成了。据广大农村的人工交配站的统计，已有八十五万多头羊进行过人工交配，超过了原订计划一万多头。皮尔拉特·莱赫比国营农场更以提前两个半月的成绩完成了全年的生产任务。该场的工人超额向国家生产了二百三十公担小麦、九百三十公担水果、一百公担烟草和二百公担的各色蔬菜。
    为迎接喜庆的全民节日而展开的社会主义劳动竞赛已波澜壮阔地在全国每一个角落展开了。现在响应争取“祖国解放十五周年生产队”光荣称号的生产队已达八百二十一个，参加的工人达九千三百多人，单首都地拉那就有一百九十一个生产队共二千多人参加了这一运动，其中并有四十八个最优秀的生产队已开始了1960年的工作。他们认真地完成了争取这一光荣称号的条件：又好、又省地进行生产，不断地提高生产技术、文化水平和共产主义觉悟。
    合理化建议是阿尔巴尼亚工人们向祖国节日的献智。今年九个月来，广大劳动人民已提出了三千六百五十条合理化建议，单其中的一千三百四十五条就已为国家节约了九千四百万里克。曾经由于杰出的倡议和劳动而荣获了社会主义劳动英雄称号的老突击手们，在这一次迎接伟大的节日时又走在最先列。社会主义劳动英雄、拖拉机手布杜·伊苏弗在1956年就提出了机耕五千二百公顷不大修的倡议，为国家节约了五十九万多里克。今天，为迎接十五周年国庆，他已提出机耕一万公顷不大修的倡议。社会主义劳动英雄、司机贝赫莱·杜达提出了汽车行驶六十万公里不大修的保证。目前斯库台区已有一百八十多个司机参加安全行驶十万公里不大修的运动。
    距离节日只有两天了，阿尔巴尼亚广大工人正以最后的生产喜讯来向亲爱的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党报捷，以更大的胜利来迎接光辉的节日。
    本报地拉那27日电　阿尔巴尼亚全国各地广泛展开了各种活动，庆祝即将到来的祖国解放十五周年。从11月份开始，各地的工矿企业、农业合作社、学校和机关，就纷纷举行报告会、座谈会、漫谈会，青年、少先队员和妇女也举行了各种集会，并结合本地区的解放节日广泛地展开了关于阿尔巴尼亚解放十五年来成就的宣传。不少地区还举办了工农业成就造型艺术、照片和图书等展览会。发罗那城举办的“今昔展览会”，以各种实物和图表把解放前后作了一个显明的对比。
    阿尔巴尼亚党和政府的领导人也都参加了广大群众的庆祝活动。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第一书记霍查和爱尔巴桑的少先队员们在一起庆祝该城的解放日，并和十五岁的儿童一起欢庆他们的生日。部长会议主席谢胡同首都的学生、少先队员和选民们举行了会见，并作了阿尔巴尼亚解放十五年来成就的报告。为了教育下一代，很多地方的工会和青年联盟组织，组织了青年工人和少先队员们到过去游击队英勇战斗过的地方去旅行，以实地的参观和体会来学习长辈们英勇斗争精神。同时不少农业合作社也组织了农民们参观工厂和城市，组织工人和农民的联欢，增进工农群众之间的联系和友谊。在迎接愉快的节日时。很多城镇和农村的居民庆贺自己的电站、自来水站和新商店开幕。库里斯区的人民隆重集会庆祝该区建成了第一个广播电台。多玛·哈西村由于有了电灯，在送电的第一天，就有八个农业社社员购买了新的收音机。一批又一批的新房子，迎接了他们的新主人。单是柴立克石油城就建造了九千平方米的新住宅。
