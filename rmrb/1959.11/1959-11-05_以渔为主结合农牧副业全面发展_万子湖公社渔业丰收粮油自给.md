Developing Fishery as the Main Focus, Combined with Comprehensive Development of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Sideline Production
Wanzihu Commune Achieves Bumper Fishery Harvest and Self-Sufficiency in Grain and Oil

(Our Dispatch) The Wanzihu Commune in Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, has seen a great leap forward in all aspects of production. By the end of September, the commune's income from fishing reached more than 360,000 yuan, an increase of nearly one-third compared to the total fishing income for the entire year of 1958. By October 15th, the commune had overfulfilled its annual plan to catch 1.8 million jin of fresh fish, two and a half months ahead of schedule. Based on the ideological mobilization of opposing Rightist tendencies and boosting morale, the commune is determined to catch another 1.5 million jin of fresh fish, increasing the net income of each person by ten yuan.

For many years, the fishermen of Wanzihu Commune bought rice to eat. This year, they produced 2.2 million jin of rice, basically achieving self-sufficiency in grain for the commune's more than 4,000 people. In addition to self-sufficiency, they also sold 10,000 jin of cooking oil to the state. Furthermore, they have developed livestock and poultry production on barren islands.

Wanzihu is part of Dongting Lake, covering an area of more than 400,000 mu, of which more than 300,000 mu are water surface, and there are some scattered fertile lake islands along the lake. More than 1,200 households, with a total population of more than 4,600 fishermen and farmers, live in the lake area. In 1954, five fishery cooperatives and two agricultural cooperatives were formed here, and production developed year by year, and living standards improved day by day. In 1958, there was a great leap forward in all aspects of production, and the advanced cooperatives were no longer able to adapt to the needs of the developing production situation. The masses spontaneously broke the boundaries of the cooperatives and implemented large-scale labor cooperation during the peak fishing season and busy farming season. In October 1958, the five fishery cooperatives and two agricultural cooperatives merged to form a commune focusing on fishery and combining agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline production. As soon as the commune was established, it demonstrated its great power. The brigades specializing in agricultural production accounted for about one-third of the total number of households in the commune, including some labor forces transferred from fishermen. During the busy seasons of harvesting and rice transplanting, the fishing teams and animal husbandry teams supported the agricultural teams with more than 4,800 workdays, and also supported a large amount of lake grass fertilizer, thus ensuring a bumper harvest in agriculture this year. The large-scale fishing tools such as set nets and wind-powered boats that the fishermen longed to add have also been added since communization. With these fishing tools, one net can catch tens of thousands of jin.

In the past, the contradictions between fishermen competing for lake grounds and wharfs were very sharp. Good wharfs saw boats colliding and nets rubbing against each other, which drove the fish away and damaged the tools. After communization, the lake grounds and wharfs were uniformly planned and rationally arranged; at the same time, the different fishing tools were rationally adjusted, and various professional fishing teams were established according to each person's strengths; labor was divided and cooperated, and the production potential of tools and lake grounds was fully utilized. Each fishing professional team also adopted different fishing tools according to the changes in water level and the living habits of different fish species. Deep water and shallow water, peak season and off-season, all seasons have complete fishing tools, so the fishery has a bumper harvest every season. In June, July and August this year, which are the off-season for fishing, the whole commune caught more than 440,000 jin of fish, which is more than 20,000 jin more than the fourth quarter of last year, which was the peak fishing season.

The combination of fishing and aquaculture can only be achieved after communization. For several years, the fishermen have also been planning to raise fish, but the fishery cooperatives are too scattered and really powerless in such a large water area. Communization has united the fishermen into a whole, and this spring, they released a large number of fish fry.

The People's Commune has also twisted fishery, agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations into one rope, making production bloom in all directions. Now, the commune has three fishery brigades, one agricultural brigade and one animal husbandry brigade. Five hundred and forty-six of the commune's more than 1,200 households are specialized in agricultural and animal husbandry production. They cultivate more than 2,000 mu of paddy fields and reclaim more than 2,000 mu of barren lake islands, raising more than 2,000 pigs and more than 400 cattle. During the off-season for fishing, the fishing brigades draw people to support agricultural production, help solve a large amount of fertilizer, and ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture this year. In addition to achieving self-sufficiency in grain for fishermen, they also supplied more than 10,000 jin of bait grain for fishing and more than 7,000 jin of hemp for weaving fishing nets. Minglang Mountain, which has always been called a "relief center", although it has more than 1,000 mu of natural good pastures, it was not utilized in the past. After communization, a professional livestock farm was built here, and cattle and sheep are now in groups and pigs are full of pens on the barren islands. This year, the total output value of diversified operations in the commune can reach 1.08 million yuan, an increase of 60% compared with last year's great leap forward. The public accumulation of the commune has also greatly increased. This year, the accumulation of the commune can reach 360,000 yuan, with an average accumulation of 77 yuan per person. The commune's one-year accumulation is 80% more than the total accumulation of the three years from 1956 to 1958. With the implementation of the distribution system combining the supply system and the wage system, the income of more than 90% of the commune members has increased this year. The average net income of each commune member can reach 107 yuan, an increase of 40% compared with last year. Nursery schools, kindergartens, public canteens and other welfare undertakings have been established in the fishing villages, and school-age children have entered schools. This year, new fishing villages have also been built, and fishermen who can settle down have moved into new homes. Women have participated in production, and the number of workers in the commune has increased by 47% this year compared with last year. The value created by each workday this year has increased by 23.5% compared with last year.

### 以渔为主结合农牧副业全面发展  万子湖公社渔业丰收粮油自给

    以渔为主结合农牧副业全面发展
    万子湖公社渔业丰收粮油自给
    本报讯　湖南省沅江县万子湖公社各项生产出现了大跃进的局面。到9月底止，全社捕鱼收入三十六万多元，较1958年全年捕鱼总收入还增加将近三分之一；到10月15日为止，全社捕捞鲜鱼一百八十万斤的计划，提前两个半月超额完成了全年计划。在反右倾、鼓干劲的思想发动的基础上，全社决心再捕捞鲜鱼一百五十万斤，每人增加纯收入十元。
    多少年来，万子湖公社的渔民是买米吃的。今年这里生产了二百二十万斤稻谷，全社四千多人的口粮基本上做到自给；食油除自给外，还卖给国家一万斤；另外还在荒洲上发展家畜家禽生产。
    万子湖是洞庭湖的一部分，面积有四十多万亩，其中水面占三十多万亩，沿湖还有些星罗棋布的湖洲沃土。在湖区，住着渔民和农民共有一千二百多户、四千六百多人。1954年，这里组成了五个渔业社和两个农业社，生产年年发展，生活日益改善。1958年各项生产大跃进，高级社已经不能适应当时的生产形势发展的需要了，群众自动打破了合作社的界限，在捕鱼旺季和农忙季节实行了劳力大协作。1958年10月间，五个渔业社和两个农业社合并建成以渔业为主，结合农、牧、副业的公社。公社一建立，就显示了它的巨大威力。专门从事农业生产的大队，约占全公社总户数的三分之一，其中包括从渔民中抽调的一部分劳动力。在收割、插秧等农事紧张的季节，渔业队和牧业队共支援农业队四千八百多个劳动日，同时还支援了大量的湖草肥料，这样就保证了今年农业的大丰收。渔民渴望添置的架子网、风网船等大型捕鱼工具，公社化以后也添置起来了。有了这些捕鱼工具，一网能捕几万斤。
    过去渔民争湖场、埠头的矛盾很尖锐，好的埠头船碰船、网挨网，这样就把鱼赶走了，工具也损坏了。公社化后，湖场、埠头进行了统一规划，合理安排；同时将不同的捕鱼工具进行了合理的调整，按各人特长，建立各种捕捞专业队；分工协作，充分发挥了工具和湖场的生产潜力。各个捕鱼专业队又根据水位的变化和不同鱼类的生活规律，采用不同的捕捞工具。深水浅水，旺季淡季，四季捕捞工具齐全，因此季季渔业丰收。今年6、7、8三个月是捕鱼淡季，全公社捕鱼四十四万多斤，较去年捕鱼旺季的第四季度还多两万多斤。
    捕捞与养殖并举，也只有在公社化以后才能办得到。几年来，渔民也盘算养鱼，但渔业社太分散了，在这样大的水面上真是无能为力。公社化把渔民联成了一个整体，就在今年春天，他们放养了大量的鱼苗。
    人民公社还把渔、农、牧、副业拧成一根绳，使生产四面八方开了花。现在，全社有三个渔业大队，一个农业大队和一个畜牧大队。全社一千二百多户有五百四十六户专门从事农业和畜牧业的生产，他们耕种两千多亩稻田和开垦二千多亩湖洲荒土，养二千多头猪和四百多头牛。在捕鱼淡季，渔业大队抽人支援农业生产，协助解决大量的肥料，保证了今年农业丰收。除做到渔民口粮自给，还供给了捕鱼用的饵谷一万多斤，以及编鱼网用的麻七千多斤。一向被人称为“救济院”的明朗山，虽然有一千多亩天然的好牧场，但过去未得利用，公社化后这里建起了专业畜牧场，荒洲上已经牛羊成群猪满圈了。今年全社多种经营的总产值可达一百零八万元，较大跃进的去年增加60％。公社公共积累也大大增加了，今年全社积累可达三十六万元，平均每人积累七十七元，公社一年的积累较1956年到1958年的三年积累总和还多80％。随着供给制和工资制相结合的分配制度的实行，今年全社90％以上的社员增加了收入。平均每个社员的纯收入可达一百零七元，较去年增加40％。渔村办起了托儿所、幼儿园、公共食堂等福利事业，学龄儿童都进了学校。今年还新建了渔民新村，能够定居下的渔民，都搬进了新居。妇女参加了生产，今年全公社出工人数较去年增加47％。今年每个劳动日所创造的价值，较去年提高23.5％。
