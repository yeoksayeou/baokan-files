Xinhua News Agency, November 12th: The autumn afforestation in northern provinces and regions is progressing rapidly, and the winter afforestation in southern provinces and regions will also be launched.

According to statistics from twelve provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions including Beijing, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia, by November 4th, the autumn afforestation area had reached 33 million mu, and about 1 billion trees had been planted around houses and villages. Gansu, Henan, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, and Ningxia provinces (regions) are close to completing their autumn and winter afforestation tasks.

The Northeast and Inner Mongolia regions started autumn afforestation earlier. Since late October, North China and Northwest China have also started large-scale autumn afforestation campaigns. After the anti-Rightist struggle to boost morale, the preparation work for autumn afforestation this year is generally more adequate in various places. Many counties and communes in various regions have established afforestation headquarters. Before afforestation, various places in Inner Mongolia also leveled the ground. Shanxi Province prepared 1.1 billion seedlings and collected 21.82 million catties of various seeds for autumn and winter afforestation. This autumn, afforestation in various places relies closely on the people's communes, organizing afforestation shock teams on a prepared basis to carry out short-term crash afforestation, so the progress is relatively fast. In Wenxian County, Gansu Province, various people's communes formed more than 400 afforestation shock teams, and overfulfilled their plans in five days of intensive work.

This autumn's afforestation work has paid more attention to the construction of timber forests and oil forests in various places, and some places have begun to focus on the construction of timber forest and oil forest bases. In the autumn afforestation campaign, various places in Hebei Province have adopted the policy of focusing on timber forests, while simultaneously developing economic forests and shelter forests. Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi and other provinces have also planted a large number of walnut forests this autumn.

The winter afforestation campaign in southern provinces (regions) will also be fully launched in mid-to-late November or early December. At present, various places are actively carrying out seed collection, seedling preparation, and labor organization.

    紧紧依靠人民公社调动人马突击植树
    北方秋季造林三千万亩
    据新华社12日讯　北方各省、区的秋季造林进展迅速，南方各省、区的冬季造林也将展开。
    根据北京、河北、河南、山西、陕西、内蒙古、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、甘肃、青海、宁夏等十二个省、市、区的统计，到11月4日秋季造林面积已达三千三百万亩，四旁植树约十亿株。甘肃、河南、黑龙江、吉林、辽宁、内蒙古、宁夏等省（区）接近完成秋、冬季造林任务。
    秋季造林较早的是东北、内蒙古等地区。10月下旬以来，华北和西北地区也都开始了大规模的秋季造林运动。经过反右倾、鼓干劲，今年各地对秋季造林的准备工作一般比较充分。各地区许多县和公社都成立了造林指挥部。内蒙古各地在造林前还整了地。山西省为秋、冬季造林准备了各种苗木十一亿株，采集各种种子二千一百八十二万斤。各地今秋造林都是紧紧依靠人民公社，在有准备的基础上组织造林突击队伍，进行短时期的突击造林，因而进度较快。甘肃省文县各人民公社组成四百多个造林突击队，大战五天就超额完成了计划。
    今秋造林工作各地比较注意营造用材林和油料林，有些地方已开始抓用材林和油料林的基地建设工作。河北省各地在开展秋季造林运动当中，采取了以用材林为主，经济林、防护林同时并举的方针。河北、山西、陕西等省今秋还种植了大量的核桃林。
    南方各省（区）的冬季造林运动，11月中下旬或12月上旬也将全面展开，目前各地正在积极进行采种、准备苗木、组织劳力等工作。
