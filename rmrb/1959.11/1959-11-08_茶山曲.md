    Tea Mountain Song
    When Song Xiaosong visits Cheyun Mountain, he must listen to the girls; if he doesn't drink a cup of "Maojian Tea", he shouldn't expect the girls to talk to him. Eight hundred families live at the foot of Cheyun Mountain, and every household picks mountain tea. Now the tea mountain has undergone great changes, all thanks to the people's communization. Eight hundred families live at the foot of Cheyun Mountain, and every household picks mountain tea. The commune brings water up the mountain, watering the endless new tea. The tea-picking girls sing many songs, and every line praises the people's communization. The songs make the tea mountain smile, and tea flowers bloom all over the mountains and fields.

    茶山曲
    宋小松到车云山去作客，就得听姑娘的话，不喝一杯“毛尖茶”，可别打算叫姑娘答话。车云山下八百家，家家户户采山茶。如今茶山变化大，全亏人民公社化。车云山下八百家，家家户户采山茶。公社引水上了山，浇不完的新茶。采茶姑娘歌声多，哪一句不唱公社化。歌声唱得茶山笑，满山遍野开茶花。
