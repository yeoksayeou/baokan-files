Taming Mountains and Rivers, No Worries About Drought or Flood
——Introducing the Experiences of the Dayan Commune Construction Management Area, Yun County
The Working Group of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Yun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
"Water flows on the mountaintop, terraced fields fill the gullies, apples fragrance the mountains, fish swim in the ponds, no worries about food or clothing, no need for oxen to turn the mill, no need for oil to light the lamps, people in the high mountains will forever be without worry!"

This is a song praising the new face of the Construction Management Area of the Dayan Commune in Yun County.

This management area is a large mountainous region, formerly known as a place of "poor mountains and wicked waters." More than six thousand people had only more than twelve thousand mu of cultivated land, of which more than eleven thousand mu were on stony mountain slopes of about thirty degrees. When it was dry, the crops died from drought; after three days of rain, "sloping land was washed into bare slabs of stone, and gullied land was silted up into chaotic rubble beaches." Until 1949, the average grain harvest here was less than three hundred jin per person.

Under the shining light of the General Line, the enthusiasm of the commune members for taming water and mountains was high. They built six main canals and ninety-six branch canals on the mountains, and dug hundreds of ponds and dams in the gullies, so that every mountain had a canal and every gully had a pond. Entire mountains and entire hillsides were transformed into terraced fields, with thirty or forty layers from the foot of the mountain to the top, like a giant snail. Now, each person has an average of one mu of terraced fields and seven fen of terraced land. Having withstood the test of the historically rare great mountain flood of 1958 and the historically rare great drought of 1959, they have achieved freedom from drought and flood. The total grain output in 1948 was 520,000 jin, and in 1958 it rose to 6,420,000 jin, an increase of more than tenfold in ten years! This year – a year of extreme drought – the food ration standard of the commune members has caught up with the most affluent plains areas in the county, and they have also sold 1.35 million jin of surplus grain. This has initially solved a problem that had not been solved here for thousands of years – a surplus of grain!

The development of grain production has driven the comprehensive development of diversified operations. Now, mountain top roads have been opened to traffic; rows of fruit trees have been planted on both sides of the hillside, and some have already begun to blossom and bear fruit this year. Ponds and dams dot the gullies, all filled with fish; the dragon's beard grass planted on the banks of the terraced fields has begun to be harvested; water-powered mills, paper mills, wineries, wild fiber processing plants... have been established one after another; cattle and sheep graze in flocks on the mountains and along the canals; and the first hydropower station is under construction beside the canal. In just over three years, the face of this poor mountainous area has changed dramatically.

Taming Mountains Starts with Taming Water

In the past, this place was poor, not only because it was subjected to the oppression and exploitation of the ruling class, but also because it was subjected to natural disasters. Farming on those stony mountain slopes of about thirty degrees meant dealing with floods every year. "Mountain water flows chaotically, with thousands of gullies on the slopes." Year after year, the soil was eroded, and the sloping land became thinner and thinner. The flat land in the gullies yielded only about a hundred jin of grain per season, and the sloping land yielded only seventy jin in a good year. In the event of heavy rain, "the sloping land would be washed into bare slabs of stone, and the gullied land would be silted up into chaotic rubble beaches," so they had to abandon it and open up new wasteland, and cultivated land could never be fixed. This resulted in "no grain in the granary without opening wasteland for a year; adults and children starving if no wasteland is opened for three years." The more wasteland opened, the thinner the land became, and the poorer the people became.

No one knows which dynasty or generation it was, but someone opened two canals, totaling less than five li in length, in the Dalonggou at the foot of Sifang Mountain in a village called "Fanshanyan," and converted some of the sloping land into terraced fields along the hillside. As a result, this village was more productive and its life was richer than ordinary villages in the area. After liberation, the chairman of the farmers' association, Gao Huatang (now a member of the Party committee of this commune and the second secretary of the management area), converted a mu of land on this canal into terraced fields, and harvested two hundred jin of wheat and four hundred and twenty jin of rice a year. He summarized the following major benefits of converting to terraced fields: First, there is no worry about drought or flood; second, water, soil, and fertilizer are conserved; third, less labor is required, more grain is harvested, and it is easy to reform farming techniques; fourth, converting to terraced fields saves a lot of labor and creates conditions for the comprehensive development of diversified operations.

"It's better to plant one nest than to plant a whole slope!" "Where water is diverted, there is wealth; where there is land, there is money." Gao Huatang preached this truth everywhere. He found the road to wealth for the mountainous areas, and found the direction for the development of the mountainous areas!

Two Kinds of Thinking, Two Roads

To tame mountains and rivers, it is necessary to understand water and mountains, and to clarify whether it is "a poor place with poor mountains and wicked waters" or "a good place with good mountains and good waters"? Before the establishment of the advanced cooperatives, some people grumbled, saying, "Socialism is good, but it can't get up our high mountains." 社员 Wang Xinlong went to the plains a few times and quarreled with his son to separate the family and move down the mountain. The branch secretary Gao Huatang and the cadres discussed it and came up with the direction for the mountainous areas – the typical example of "Fanshanyan" – and mobilized the commune members to count on their fingers: which family is poor and which family is rich? Why? After counting, all the households with a good life had a "toad pit" – a paddy field. This attracted people's attention.

After the land reform, Gao Huatang wanted to turn all three mu of land he had been allocated into terraced fields, but he was alone and could not control the water. After the establishment of the mutual aid team, he wanted to divert water to change the fields, and even looked at the canal route, but the opening of the canal had to pass through the land of the individual farmer Jiao Busheng. Jiao Busheng did not join the cooperative when the primary cooperative was established, and the canal could not be opened. Gao Huatang thought about water in his dreams in the middle of the night, but unfortunately he could not control the water.

As soon as the advanced cooperative was established, branch secretary Gao Huatang put forward a proposal to open canals, divert water, and change terraced fields at the township general branch committee. Most of the branch committee members agreed, but branch committee member Zhang Hongxing disagreed. He said: "Our Jianshe Township is a place where people sell firewood. It's okay in winter, selling firewood to make some money is the 'right thing' and the 'urgent demand' of the masses. As soon as the advanced cooperative is established, the masses have not been divided anything yet, so we go to open canals and change fields, what if we ruin the cooperative?" The struggle between the two lines unfolded at the branch meeting. Should we engage in sideline production or basic construction? This matter also caused controversy among the commune members. Some commune members said: "We are a poor mountain gully, we have no land, if we don't go to cut firewood and sell it, what will we eat?" Some commune members also said: "People in the plains are rich, we are poor, and we are poor because we have no land. We must change the fields!" The branch criticized Zhang Hongxing's thinking, and also launched a mass debate, criticizing some people who only wanted to engage in private sideline production and were unwilling to engage in basic construction. The relationship between immediate interests and long-term interests was clarified, laying the ideological foundation for opening canals and changing fields.

The first thing to do when opening a canal is surveying. Gao Huatang ran to the district and invited a technician from the county water conservancy bureau. The technician looked at the canal route and shook his head repeatedly, saying: "This project is huge! It will take at least thirty to forty thousand workdays, ten thousand jin of lime, and one thousand jin of explosives alone. We can't be blind!" At this time, branch committee member Zhang Hongxing came out to speak again: "Look! I said it can't be built, but you insisted on building it. If the government doesn't build this big canal for us, how can we build it?" The debate started again, and some commune members also agreed with Zhang Hongxing's opinion. Gao Huatang and the cadres went deep into the masses to decide to rely on the masses to find a solution. As a result, they visited a commune member named Tu Guobin, who was a carpenter and had measured a small canal when he was working alone. The cadres worked with him to measure, dig, and release water at the same time, and the big canal was started. During construction, they encountered large stones that required explosives, iron bars, and lime. The cadres also visited a hunter named Li Zhengqing in the masses, who knew how to mix explosives himself, and the materials were all produced in the mountains. As for lime, there is limestone on the mountain, and there is firewood. As long as you burn a few kilns, you will never run out. The only thing left was the iron bars, which they couldn't get. The commune members used sharpened wooden poles instead. When they were worn down, they would sharpen them again. When they were broken, they would cut them again. Anyway, there were plenty of trees in the mountains. Thanks to fully relying on the masses, a fifteen-li long canal was opened to water in eight days. This fact powerfully resolved the debate about whether to rely on the government to build water conservancy or to rely on the masses to build water conservancy.

When the main canal was opened to water, gongs and drums were beaten on the slopes as if celebrating a happy event. Near the canal, cadres and elderly commune members shouted and urged people to change the fields. Commune members from other places also kept going to the township cadres to ask for the canals to be opened to their places. In the process of repairing the first canal, eight of the thirteen general branch committee members learned how to measure canals, and 70% of the cadres above the team level learned how to measure branch canals, which created conditions for comprehensive blooming.

Overall Planning to Change the Face

Through diverting water to the mountains and changing terraced fields, everyone summarized two experiences in water control in mountainous areas. First, water control must be combined with water use (changing fields, raising fish, water conservancy processing). In the past, water control was also mentioned here, and technical cadres also emphasized maintaining water and soil and preventing mountain floods. But at that time, the enthusiasm of the masses was not so great. After changing sloping land into terraced fields and irrigating the fields with water, the masses changed their view of water. Evil water became beneficial water, became the lifeline, and became a "treasure." As the enthusiasm of the masses came, all kinds of methods were thought of: the commune members dug ponds and dams at the heads of every gully, and opened herringbone ditches on the hillsides, trying to divert even a drop of water into the ponds; on both sides of the hillside, the commune members found places that did not leak water to dig storage ponds, and when they did not need water in winter and spring, they kept pouring water into them, for fear that the canal water would flow away in vain; they built dams section by section in the river, and also connected the rivers through canals, so that they could adjust each other... Second, there is no river that cannot go up the mountain. Trees have roots, water has sources, and rivers all come from the mountains. Rivers flow from high to low, and the greater the flow of water, the more difficult it is to control downstream. To control water, it is necessary to start from the upper reaches of the river, intercepting it section by section, and diverting it section by section. After intercepting it several or dozens of times, the water becomes smaller, and the downstream becomes easier to control. Therefore, water control breaks the boundaries of production teams, cooperatives, and even counties, diverting water from far away and irrigating fields nearby. To do this, it is necessary to adopt a method of combining leadership and the masses to make an overall plan.

In the spring of 1957, Cui Mingquan, the first secretary of the county party committee, came to this management area. General Branch Secretary Gao Huatang led him around to see the newly transformed terraced fields. The fields were changed in scattered pieces, and there were quite a few scattered pieces. Comrade Cui Mingquan praised them for doing a good job in opening canals and changing fields, and said to Gao Huatang: "Lao Gao, with so much water, can you change all the sloping land into terraced fields?" The instructions of the county party committee gave people great inspiration. After discussion, the general branch committee decided to take Sanligang, the irrigation area of the first main canal and the first branch canal, as the focus, and concentrate the strength of cadres and the masses to first change a mountain to show the masses and accumulate experience. In the winter of that year, "battle sheds" were built in Sanligang, and gongs and drums were sounded to start working. More than 300 people in this production team who could change the fields all participated in the change. Every morning before dawn, the commune members went to the construction site with torches, and when it rained, everyone put on straw raincoats. Their slogan was: "Eat a little temporary bitterness, shed happy sweat, work hard for two or three years, change nature." In this way, 350 laborers, in one month and seven days, changed all 150 mu of sloping land, and opened up some wasteland, changing a total of 180 mu of terraced fields, reaching an average of 15 mu of terraced fields per household.

After the transformation of Sanligang, the township gained experience: changing fields is controlling mountains. The most fundamental way to prevent erosion and maintain water and soil is to change to terraced fields. To do this well, it is necessary to fight in large corps, and one action is a mountain, treating this mountain and then that mountain. The specific method of changing an entire mountain into terraced fields is to start from the top of the mountain next to the canal and go down, following the terrain and bending with the terrain, arranging the terraced fields densely, without forcing the conversion into large fields; digging, picking up stones, and building field embankments at the same time, digging in and padding out, and when the fields are dug flat, the field embankments are also built. After loosening and leveling the soil, you can plant seeds; if there is little soil and many stones, plant dry crops in the first year, and transplant seedlings after the soil has been silted up and the stones have been picked up. The more you plant, the thicker the soil becomes.

After Sanligang made a model, the commune members all ran more than ten li to see it, as if watching a "novelty." Zhong Maocai of Jiuligang originally did not believe in mountain control. After going to Sanligang and seeing that an entire mountain had been changed into terraced fields, like a large snail with thirty or forty layers, he changed his tune after returning, saying to everyone he met: "Go to Sanligang and see it! People have changed the stony slopes of an entire mountain into terraced fields. Why can't we change our good place into terraced fields?" After the whole township visited here, the minds of cadres and the masses were liberated. They no longer changed the fields in scattered pieces, and all began to make plans to change an entire slope or an entire mountain, forming a mass upsurge in water control and mountain control.

Liberated the mind, had an overall plan, launched a large-scale mass movement, from the winter of 1957 to the spring of 1958, this management area reached the level of one mu of terraced fields and seven fen of terraced land per person, and the cultivated land was basically fixed.

Take Grain as the Key Link, Drive Diversified Operations

After opening canals and changing terraced fields, the initial grain problem was solved, which led to the development of diversified operations. With more fields and unused rice straw, dragon's beard grass was planted to protect the field banks, and nine paper mills were established; with more grain to be processed, twelve water mills were set up; with water in the canals and more ponds, 240,000 fish were raised; to raise fish, fish hatcheries were established. The development of diversified operations has also promoted the comprehensive management of the mountains. Now, mountain flood disasters have been fundamentally eliminated here, soil erosion has been controlled in most areas, and cultivated land has basically achieved freedom from drought and flood.

After initially solving the grain problem, a large number of labor forces were saved and invested in diversified operations and the fundamental treatment of barren hills. After the establishment of the people's commune, it opened up a broad road for the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Now, afforestation in the entire management area has reached more than 13,000 mu, including more than 80,000 economic forests and fruit trees, and 2.7 million citrus seedlings have been cultivated. This autumn, apples and oranges have begun to bear fruit. Compared with before liberation, the original major local specialties have increased: tung oil trees have increased from 1,800 mu to more than 7,000 mu, dragon's beard grass has increased from 1,200 mu to 6,565 mu, and persimmons have increased from 500,000 jin to 1.4 million jin. Taking advantage of the large amount of grass in the mountains, the number of pigs has increased from 370 to 1,676, averaging more than one per household; the number of sheep has increased from 660 to 2,289, and 302 boxes of tussah silkworms have been newly released. This year's income from diversified operations is expected to average about 140 yuan per person.

In the process of changing the face of nature, people have also changed their subjective world. Wang Xinlong, who disliked the poor mountain gully and moved down the mountain, moved back after several requests. Many girls from other townships married young people in the mountain gully. People's tone of speech is also different from the past. In the past, they would open their mouths and say, "We are a poor mountain gully, how can we compare with others?" Now, this "poor mountain gully," which has never dared to compare grain with the plains in history, has also put forward the battle slogan of "grain must surpass the plains."

    治山治水旱涝无忧
    ——郧县大堰公社建设管理区经验介绍
    中共襄阳地委、郧县县委工作组
    “水在山顶流，梯田满山沟，遍山苹果香，鱼在塘里游，吃不愁，穿不愁，推磨不用牛，点灯不用油，高山人家永无忧！”
    这是人们对郧县大堰公社建设管理区新面貌的颂歌。
    这个管理区是个大山区，从前被称作“穷山恶水”的地方。六千多人口，只有一万二千多亩耕地，其中有一万一千多亩是在三十度上下的麻骨石山坡上。天干，庄稼旱死啦；下三天雨，就会“坡地冲成光石板，沟地淤成乱石滩”。直到1949年，这里收的粮食平均每人还不到三百斤。
    在总路线的光辉照耀下，社员们治水治山热情高涨，在山上修了六条干渠和九十六条支渠，在沟里挖了百把口塘堰，做到了山山有渠，沟沟有塘。整架山、整个山坡都改成了梯田，从山脚到山顶，三、四十层，像个大螺蛳一样。现在每人平均已经有一亩梯田、七分梯地。经过1958年历史上少有的大山洪和1959年历史上少有的大旱的考验，达到了旱涝无忧。1948年的粮食总产量是五十二万斤，1958年上升到六百四十二万斤，十年增产十多倍！今年——特大干旱之年，社员们的口粮标准赶上了全县最富裕的平原地区，还卖了一百三十五万斤余粮。这就初步解决了这里几千年来所没有解决的问题——粮食有余！
    粮食生产的发展，带动了多种经营的全面发展。现在，山顶公路已经通车；两边山坡上果树已经成行，有的今年已经开始开花结果。山沟里塘堰点点，都养满了鱼；梯田岸上栽的龙须草，已经开始收割；水打磨、造纸厂、酒厂、野生纤维加工厂……，先后办起来了；山上、渠边，牛羊成群；渠边，头一个水力发电站正在兴建。不过三年多的工夫，这个穷山区的面貌已经大大改变。
    治山先治水
    过去，这个地方穷，除了受统治阶级的压迫和剥削之外，还受着自然灾害的压迫。在那些三十度上下的麻骨石山坡上种地，就得年年和洪水打交道。“山上水乱流，坡上万条沟”。年年冲刷，水土流失，坡地越种越薄。沟里的坪地一年两季不过收百把斤粮食，坡地好年成才收七十斤。碰到大雨，“坡地冲成光石板，沟地淤成乱石滩”，只好丢了再开新荒，耕地老是不能固定。这样就形成了“一年不开荒，仓里没粮装；三年不开荒，大人娃子饿的慌。”荒越开越多，地越种越薄，人越过越穷。
    不知道是哪朝哪代，有人在一个叫作“翻山堰”的村子的四方山脚下的大长沟里，开了两道渠，总共不到五里长，并且顺山坡把几片坡地改成了梯田。因此，这个村子比当地一般村子的生产好，生活也较富。解放后，农会主席高华堂（现在是这个公社的党委委员、管理区第二书记）在这条渠上改了亩把田，一年收了二百斤麦子，四百二十斤稻谷。他总结出改梯田有以下几大好处：第一，旱涝无忧；第二，保水、保土、保肥；第三，费工少，收粮多，便于改革耕作技术；第四，种梯田省出来很多工，给全面发展多种经营创造了条件。
    “能种一个窝，不种一面坡！”“哪里引水哪里富，哪里有田哪里有钱。”高华堂到处宣传这个道理。他找到了大山区由穷变富的道路，找到了山区的发展方向！
    两种思想两条道路
    要想治山治水，就要认识水、认识山，弄清楚到底是“穷山恶水穷地方”，还是“好山好水好地方”？在办高级社以前，有些人咕咕哝哝，说“社会主义好倒好，就是上不了我们这大高山”。社员王新隆到平原去了几回，吵着和儿子分了家，搬下山去了。支部书记高华堂和干部们商量了一下，就拿出了山区的方向——“翻山堰”这个典型，发动社员扳着指头算：哪家穷，哪家富？为啥？算来算去，凡是生活好的户，都是有个“蛤蟆坑”——水田。这样，引起了人们的注意。
    土改以后，高华堂就想把他分到的三亩地都改成梯田，可是人单力孤，治不住水。成立互助组以后，他又想引渠改田，连渠路也看好了，可是开渠要经过单干户农民焦步升的地。成立初级社时，焦步升没有入社，渠还是开不成。高华堂想水想得半夜里作梦，可惜就是治不住水。
    高级社刚一办成，支部书记高华堂就在乡总支委员会上提出了开渠引水改梯田的建议。多数支委都赞成，可是支委张宏兴不同意。他说：“咱们建设乡是个老卖柴的地方，冬天没事干，卖柴弄几个钱才是‘正理’，才是群众的‘迫切要求’。刚把高级社办起来，群众啥东西还没分到，就去开渠、改田，把社搞垮了怎么办？”两条路线的斗争在支部会上展开了。搞副业呢，还是搞基本建设？这个事在社员中间也引起了争论。有的社员说：“我们这穷山沟嘛，要田没有，再不去砍柴卖，吃啥？”也有的社员说：“人家平原富，我们穷，穷就穷在没田上，就是要改田！”支部批判了张宏兴的思想，又开展了群众性的辩论，批判了有些人只想搞私人副业、不愿搞基本建设的思想。明确了眼前利益和长远利益的关系，为开渠改田打下了思想基础。
    开渠头一件事就是测量。高华堂跑到区里请来了县水利局的一位技术员。这位技术员顺渠路看一遍，回来就连连摇头说：“这工程可大呀！至少得三、四万工，一万斤石灰，光炸药就得一千斤，可不能盲目！”这时候，支委张宏兴又出来说话啦：“看看！我说修不成嘛，你们硬要修。这个大渠要是政府不给我们修，我们咋能修得成。”争论又开始啦，社员中间也有一部分人赞成张宏兴的意见。高华堂和干部们一起深入群众，决定依靠群众想办法。结果访问到一个社员叫涂国斌，是个木匠，单干时测量过一条小渠。干部们和他一道边测、边挖、边放水，大渠算是动了工。施工中又遇上了大石头，需要炸药、铁撬和石灰。干部们又在群众中访问了一个打猎的李正青，自己会配炸药，而且材料都是山上出产的东西。至于石灰，山上有石灰石，有柴，只要烧几窑，就用不完啦。就剩铁撬弄不到，社员们就用木杆削尖来代替，磨秃了再削，用断了再砍，反正山上有的是树。由于充分依靠了群众，一条十五里长的干渠，八天的时间就通了水。这个事实有力地解决了依靠政府修水利、还是依靠群众修水利的争论。
    干渠一通水，坡上敲锣打鼓，像办喜事一样。靠渠边的地方，干部和老年社员们喊叫着催人去改田。别处的社员们也不断的去找乡干部，要求把渠道开到他们那里去。在修头条水渠的过程中，十三个总支委员、有八个人学会了测量渠道，小队以上的干部有70％学会了测量支渠，这样就为全面开花创造了条件。
    全面规划，改变面貌
    通过引水上山和改梯田，大家总结了在山区治水的两条体会。第一，治水必须和用水（改田、养鱼、水利加工）相结合。以往这里也提过治水，技术干部也强调过保持水土，严防山洪冲刷。可是那时候群众的劲头总不是这么大。改坡地为梯田，用水灌田以后，群众对水的看法改变了，恶水成了益水，成了命脉，成了“宝贝”。群众的劲头一来，啥办法都想出来了：社员们把每条沟的沟脑都挖上了塘堰，在山坡上开上了人字沟，哪怕是一点一滴水，也想办法往塘里引；在两面山坡上，社员们找不漏水的地方挖上蓄水塘，冬春不用水的时候，一个劲往里放水，唯恐渠水白白流跑了；在河里节节筑坝，又通过渠道作到河河相连，互相调剂……。第二，没有不能上山的河。树有根，水有源，河水都是从山上来的。河从高处往低处流，水流越大，流到下游越不好治。治水，就要从河的上游治起，节节拦，节节引，拦它几道几十道之后，水小了，下游也就好治了。所以，治水打破生产队、社、以至县的界限，远处引水，近处灌田。要这样做，必须采取领导和群众相结合的方法，作出全面规划。
    1957年春天，县委第一书记崔明全到了这个管理区。总支书记高华堂领着他到处看了看初改的梯田。田改的东一块、西一块，零零星星也不在少数。崔明全同志称赞他们开渠改田这件事办的好，又向高华堂说：“老高，你们这么多的水，能不能把坡地都改成梯田？”县委的指示，给了人们很大的启发。总支委员会经过讨论决定：以第一条干渠第一条支渠的灌区——三里岗为重点，集中干部和群众力量，先改出一架山来，给群众作个样子，积累经验。这年冬天，三里岗上搭起了“战棚”，锣鼓喧天干起来了。这个生产队三百多个能改田的人，统统参加了改田。每天早上天不亮，社员们打着火把去工地，下雨大家披上蓑衣干。他们的口号是：“吃点临时苦，流下幸福汗，苦战两三年，改变大自然。”就这样，三百五十个劳力，一个月零七天，把一百五十亩坡地统统改完，又开了些荒，总共改成了一百八十亩梯田，达到了每户平均十五亩梯田。
    改造三里岗之后，乡里得出了经验：改田就是治山。防止冲刷，保持水土，最根本的办法就是改梯田。要想把这个事办好，必须大兵团作战，一动手就是一架山，治了这架山，再治那架山。把一架山都改成梯田的具体作法，是从山顶挨着渠道往下改，按地形随弯就弯，就蛋繁蛋，不勉强改大田；边挖、边拣石头、边砌田岸，里挖外垫，等田挖平，田岸也砌完啦，松土整平以后就可以下种；土少石头多的，头一年先种旱庄稼，等淤些土，拣完石头再栽秧，土越种越厚。
    三里岗作出样子以后，社员们都像看“稀奇”的一样，自动跑十几里到那里去看。九里岗的钟茂才原来不相信治山，跑到三里岗去一看，一架山都改成了梯田，像个大螺蛳，有三、四十层，他回去以后也改变了口气，逢人就说：“到三里岗看看去吧！人家一架山的麻骨石坡都改成了梯田，我们这好地方为什么不能改成梯田？”全乡到这里参观以后，干部和群众的思想解放了，不再零零星星的改了，都开始订出规划，一整面坡，一整架山的改起来了，形成了群众性的治水治山大高潮。
    解放了思想，有了全面规划，发动了大规模的群众运动，从1957年冬到1958年春，这个管理区就达到了每人一亩梯田和七分梯地的水平，耕地基本上固定下来了。
    以粮为纲，带动多种经营
    开渠道改梯田，初步解决了粮食问题以后，就带动了多种经营的发展。田多稻草用不完，为了保护田岸又栽上了龙须草，九个造纸厂成立了；粮食多了要加工，十二个水碾水磨架起来了；渠里有了水，堰塘多了，二十四万尾鱼养起来了；养鱼要有鱼苗，鱼苗场办起来了。多种经营的发展，也推动了综合治理大山的工作。现在，这里已经从根本上消除了山洪成灾，控制住了大部分地区的水土流失，耕地基本上达到了旱涝无忧。
    初步解决粮食问题以后，节省了大批劳动力投入多种经营和根治荒山的工作。人民公社成立以后，更为农林牧副渔的全面发展开辟了广阔的道路。现在全管理区植树造林已达一万三千多亩，其中经济林和果木林有八万多株，还培育了桔柑苗二百七十万株。今年秋季，苹果、桔子已开始结果。这里原有的大宗土特产与解放前相比，油桐由一千八百亩增加到七千多亩，龙须草由一千二百亩增加到六千五百六十五亩，柿子由五十万斤发展到一百四十万斤。利用大山草多的条件，生猪由三百七十头发展到一千六百七十六头，平均每户一头多；羊由六百六十头发展到二千二百八十九头，还新放养柞蚕三百零二筐。今年多种经营的收入，预计每人就可以平均一百四十元左右。
    人们在改变自然面貌的过程中，也改变了自己的主观世界。嫌穷山沟没有出息搬下山的王新隆，经过几次请求又搬回来了。很多外乡的姑娘和山沟的青年结了婚。人们说话的口气也和以往不一样了，以往张嘴就是“我们这穷山沟嘛，怎么能和人家比？”现在，这个历史上从来不敢和平原比粮食的“穷山沟”，也提出了“粮食也要超平原”的战斗口号。
