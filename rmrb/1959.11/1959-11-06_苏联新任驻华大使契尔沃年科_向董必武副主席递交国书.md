Xinhua News Agency, November 5th. The newly appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the People's Republic of China, Stepan V. Chervonenko, accompanied by all diplomatic officials of the Soviet Embassy in China, presented his credentials to Vice Chairman Dong Biwu at 4:30 this afternoon.

Present at the ceremony were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Director of the Protocol Department Yu Peiwen, and Deputy Director of the Soviet and Eastern European Affairs Department Yu Zhan.

During the presentation of credentials, Ambassador Chervonenko delivered a speech, and Vice Chairman Dong Biwu delivered a reply.

Ambassador Chervonenko said in his speech: Comrade Vice Chairman,

I am greatly honored to present to you the credentials from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics appointing me as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Soviet Union to the People's Republic of China, as well as the letter of recall for the former Ambassador, Comrade Yudin.

The great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history and also marked the beginning of a new relationship between the peoples of our two countries. The friendship between our two peoples has deep historical roots. The Soviet people have watched the heroic struggle for liberation of the Chinese people with deep respect and sympathy. The great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, led by the Communist Party of China, has opened up an infinitely broad field for the development of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The relations between our two countries are based on the principles of complete equality, respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in internal affairs; they are permeated with the great ideas of Lenin's proletarian internationalism. On this basis, the political, economic, and cultural cooperation between our two countries has achieved extremely broad development.

The great victories achieved by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in the construction of communism and socialism, and the unbreakable Soviet-Chinese friendship, are important conditions for the further development of the world socialist system, and a strong pillar of peace and security in the Far East and the world. In the struggle to realize the aspirations of all peace-loving people—eliminating the "Cold War," peaceful coexistence, and complete and thorough disarmament—the increasingly consolidated Soviet-Chinese friendship is a great and invincible force.

Not long ago, a Soviet party and government delegation headed by Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, came to China to participate in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the People's Republic of China, which contributed to further consolidating the fraternal friendship between the great peoples of our two countries.

Comrade Vice Chairman, to express the feelings of the Soviet people, I assure you that the Soviet people are inspired by the desire to vigorously consolidate and develop friendship and cooperation with the Chinese people. For my part, I will do my utmost to promote the deeper development of the close and friendly relations between our two countries. I am confident that in my activities as ambassador, I will always receive the necessary support and assistance from you and the Government of the People's Republic of China.

I take this opportunity to convey to you the Soviet people's deep joy for the great achievements made by the great Chinese people in socialist construction in a short historical period under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China and its Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. These achievements prove how great things people can do when their creative power is liberated and when their path is illuminated by the ever-brilliant doctrine of Marxism-Leninism. The Soviet people sincerely hope that the fraternal Chinese people will achieve new and greater successes in the cause of building their socialist motherland.

Comrade Vice Chairman, please allow me to sincerely wish you good health and new achievements in your activities for the prosperity and flourishing of the People's Republic of China.

Vice Chairman Dong Biwu replied: Comrade Ambassador,

I am very pleased to accept the credentials presented by you from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, appointing you as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the People's Republic of China, and I sincerely thank you for your warm, friendly congratulations.

Under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Soviet Union headed by Comrade Khrushchev, the great Soviet people are victoriously realizing the magnificent program of communist construction proposed by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with unprecedented political enthusiasm and creative labor. Since this year, the outstanding achievements made by the Soviet people in national economic construction are a good start to completing the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. In the latest science and technology, the Soviet Union successfully launched the cosmic rocket and automatic interplanetary station, opening a new era for mankind to conquer the universe and establishing epoch-making feats.

In the cause of easing international tension and striving for lasting world peace, the Soviet Union has made unremitting efforts. Facts have proved that the Soviet Union has always been the mainstay of defending peace. Not long ago, as an envoy of peace, Comrade Khrushchev visited the United States and put forward the Soviet proposal on complete and thorough disarmament at the United Nations General Assembly, which once again reflected mankind's desire for peace and its determination against war, gave a heavy blow to the imperialist war forces, and made great contributions to the cause of world peace, thereby having a significant and far-reaching impact on the development of the international situation. The Chinese people are immensely happy and proud of these brilliant achievements of the Soviet people.

There is a brotherly friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and the Chinese people cherish this great friendship very much. The Chinese people have always received selfless assistance and great support from the Soviet people in the struggle for socialist construction and against imperialist aggression, for which the Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude. Comrade Khrushchev personally led the Soviet party and government delegation to our country to participate in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, which was a great encouragement to our people and further deepened the fraternal friendship between the two countries. The close unity between the nine hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union has become a reliable guarantee for world peace and the cause of progress. I am deeply convinced that under the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism, the friendly relations between our two countries, based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, will surely achieve continuous development and consolidation.

Comrade Ambassador, I warmly welcome you to be the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the People's Republic of China. In your activities to strengthen the friendly cooperation between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, you will receive the full support of me and the Government of the People's Republic of China. I wish you complete victory in your work.

The newly appointed Soviet Ambassador to China, Chervonenko, met this afternoon with Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu to discuss matters related to the presentation of credentials. Present at the meeting were Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yu Peiwen, and Deputy Director of the Soviet and Eastern European Affairs Department Yu Zhan.

    递交国书时，契尔沃年科大使致颂词，董必武副主席致答词。
    契尔沃年科大使致颂词说：副主席同志：
    我十分荣幸地向你递交苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃主席团任命我为苏联驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使的国书，以及前任大使尤金同志的召回国书。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命开辟了人类历史的新纪元，也标志着我们两国的人民间新关系的开始，我们两国人民的友谊具有深远的历史根源。苏联人民怀着深厚的敬意和同情注视中国人民的英勇的解放斗争。由于中国共产党领导中国人民取得了伟大的人民革命的胜利，为苏联和中华人民共和国之间的友谊和合作的发展开辟了无限广阔的园地。我们两国的关系是建立在完全平等，尊重国家主权和领土完整，互不干涉内政的原则的基础上的；它贯穿着列宁的无产阶级国际主义的伟大思想。在这个基础之上我们两国的政治、经济和文化合作获得了极其广泛的发展。
    苏联和中华人民共和国在共产主义和社会主义的建设中所取得的伟大胜利和牢不可破的苏中友谊是世界社会主义体系进一步发展的重要条件，是远东和世界和平和安全的强大支柱。在争取实现一切爱好和平的人民的愿望——消除“冷战”、和平共处和全面的彻底的裁军的斗争中，日益巩固的苏中友谊是一支伟大的不可战胜的力量。
    不久以前，以苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联党政代表团前来中国，参加了中华人民共和国十周年的庆典，这是有助于进一步巩固我们两国伟大人民的兄弟友谊的。
    副主席同志，为了表达苏联人民的感情，我向你保证，苏联人民被大力巩固和发展同中国人民的友谊和合作的愿望所鼓舞。从我这方面来说，我将竭尽全力，促使我们两国间亲密的友好关系更深的发展。我相信，在我担任大使职务的活动中，永远会得到你和中华人民共和国政府必要的支持和协助。
    我利用这个机会向你转达苏联人民为伟大的中国人民在光荣的中国共产党及其以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，在短短的历史时期内在社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成就而感到的深为高兴的心情。这些成就证明了，当人民的创造力量获得了解放，当他们的道路被永远灿烂的马克思列宁主义的学说照耀着的时候，他们能做出多么伟大的事业。苏联人民真诚地希望兄弟的中国人民在建设自己社会主义祖国的事业中取得新的更大的成就。
    副主席同志，请允许我衷心地祝你身体健康和在为中华人民共和国繁荣、昌盛的活动中取得新的成就。
    董必武副主席致答词说：大使同志：
    我非常高兴地接受你所递交的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃主席团任命你为驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使的国书，并且衷心地感谢你的热情的友好的祝贺。
    伟大的苏联人民，在以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联共产党中央委员会的正确领导下，正以空前高涨的政治热情和创造性劳动，胜利地实现着苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会提出的共产主义建设的宏伟纲领。今年以来，苏联人民在国民经济建设中所取得的卓越成就，是提前完成七年计划的良好开端。在最新的科学技术方面，苏联成功地发射了宇宙火箭和自动行星际站，为人类征服宇宙开辟了新的纪元，树立了划时代的丰功伟迹。
    在缓和国际紧张局势和争取世界持久和平的事业中，苏联作了坚持不懈的努力。事实证明苏联一贯是捍卫和平的中流砥柱。不久前，作为和平的使者，赫鲁晓夫同志访问了美国，并且在联合国大会上提出了苏联关于全面和彻底裁军的建议，又一次反映了人类要求和平的愿望和反对战争的决心，对帝国主义战争势力给予了沉重的打击，为世界和平事业作了巨大的贡献，从而对国际局势的发展产生了重大而深远的影响。中国人民为苏联人民的这些辉煌成就感到无比高兴和自豪。
    中苏两国人民之间有着兄弟般的友谊，中国人民十分珍视这一伟大友谊。中国人民在社会主义建设和反对帝国主义侵略的斗争中一向得到苏联人民无私的援助和巨大的支持，中国人民对此表示衷心的感谢。赫鲁晓夫同志亲自率领苏联党政代表团前来我国参加建国十周年庆典，对我国人民是莫大的鼓舞，进一步加深了两国的兄弟友谊。中苏两国九亿人民之间的亲密团结，已经成为世界和平和进步事业的可靠保证。我深信，在马克思列宁主义的战无不胜的旗帜下，我们两国建立在无产阶级国际主义原则上的友好关系必将获得不断的发展和巩固。
    大使同志，我热烈地欢迎你出任苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使。在你为加强中苏两国人民友好合作的活动中，你将得到我和中华人民共和国政府的全力支持。祝你在工作中获得完全的胜利。
