    Development of Economic Conflicts Between Japan and the United States
    Japan's Trade with the United States Begins to Show a Surplus in the First Half of the Year
    The United States Tries Hard to Force Japan to Buy More American Goods

    (Reported by this newspaper) Since the first half of this year, Japan's trade deficit with the United States has improved, which has greatly dissatisfied the United States, and the economic contradictions between Japan and the United States have developed.

    Japan's exports to the United States have increased sharply in the first half of 1959. According to materials published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Japan's total exports to the United States in the first half of this year were $456.6 million, and imports from the United States were $437.9 million, resulting in a surplus of $18.7 million.

    Japanese statistics did not mention the trade surplus with the United States in the first half of this year, but indicated that Japan's trade balance had improved significantly. With the exception of a few commodities such as cotton cloth and canned tuna, Japan's main exports to the United States have increased rapidly. Japan's share of U.S. imports has increased from 5.2% in the same period of 1958 to 6.1%, exceeding the pre-war level of 5.9% in 1938.

    The United States is extremely dissatisfied with the expansion of Japanese commodities in the U.S. market. On the one hand, it is strengthening measures to restrict imports of Japanese goods, and on the other hand, it is forcing Japan to implement trade and exchange liberalization. The U.S. Ambassador to Japan once asked Japan to pay attention to "orderly exports" and "increase purchases of American goods." At a series of international conferences, such as the International Monetary Fund Conference at the end of September, the World Bank Conference, the Far East Economic Conference held in New York in October, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the United States raised the above-mentioned "demands" to Japanese representatives.

    Under pressure from the United States, Japan, due to its serious dependence on trade with the United States, has to try to maintain the high level of exports to the United States by increasing imports of American goods, thereby easing the economic contradictions between Japan and the United States. On November 11, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, disregarding the dissatisfaction of domestic trade circles, announced that Japan would abolish import restrictions on ten commodities from the dollar area next year. However, this decision by the Kishi Nobusuke government still cannot satisfy the United States. Recently, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Kearns stated that Japan's decision to abolish differential import measures for the United States and other dollar areas in the first half of next year "is not satisfactory." He demanded that Japan "immediately abolish the differential measures." He also threatened that otherwise, "the U.S. government will not be able to control the dissatisfaction of private business operators."

### 日美经济矛盾发展  日本上半年对美贸易开始出超  美国竭力迫使日本多买美国货

    日美经济矛盾发展
    日本上半年对美贸易开始出超
    美国竭力迫使日本多买美国货
    本报讯　今年上半年以来日本对美贸易逆差已有改善，美国对此深为不满，日美经济矛盾有了发展。
    1959年上半年日本对美出口急剧地扩大。据美国商务部公布的材料，今年上半年日本对美国的出口总值为四亿五千六百六十万美元，自美国的进口总值为四亿三千七百九十万美元，出超一千八百七十万美元。
    日本方面统计没有提到今年上半年日本对美贸易的出超情况，但表明日本贸易收支有了明显的改善。除了棉布、金枪鱼罐头等若干种商品外，日本主要商品的对美出口都迅速增加，日本在美国进口中所占比例，已经从1958年同期的5.2％增加到6.1％，超过了战前1938年5.9％的比例。
    美国对于日本商品在美销售阵地的扩大极为不满，一面加强限制日货进口的措施，一面强迫日本实行贸易和汇兑的自由化。美国驻日大使就曾要日本注意做到“有秩序的输出”，“增加购买美货”。在9月末的国际货币基金组织大会、世界银行大会、10月在纽约召开的远东经济会议，以及关税及贸易总协定等一系列的国际会议上，美国都向日本代表提出了上述“要求”。
    在美国压力下，日本由于对美国贸易的严重依赖性，不得不设法以增加美货进口办法来维持对美输出的高水准，从而缓和日美经济矛盾。11月11日日本通商产业省不顾国内贸易界的不满，宣布日本将在明年内取消对来自美元区的十种商品的进口限制。然而，岸信介政府的这一决定仍不能使美国满意。最近美国商务部助理部长基恩斯就曾表示，日本决定明年上半年废除对美国等美元区所实行的进口差别措施，“是不能令人满意的”。他要求日本“立即废除差别措施”。他并威胁说：否则，“美国政府将无法控制民间企业者的不满情绪。”
