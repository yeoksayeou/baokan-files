People's Capital, Tirana

	During the joyous festival celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of Albania's rebirth, the capital city of Tirana is filled with a festive atmosphere. In Skanderbeg Square, the city center named after the national hero, and on the city's tall buildings, huge slogans are hung everywhere, and bright colored flags flutter in the wind. Municipal workers are busy beautifying the city with evergreen pine trees and colorful flowers. Almost all of the city's buildings have been freshly painted. The opera house, drama theater, and variety theater have all prepared the most exciting programs. The movie theater is showing the film "Storm," which praises the war of liberation. Wide-screen movies are meeting the audience for the first time during the festival. When the sun sets in the west, the newly installed fluorescent lights illuminate the entire city as if it were daytime. Joyful people gather in groups, crowding the streets, enjoying the festive night scene. This beautiful scene only appeared in the people's capital after the Albanian people seized power and gained liberation. Only today can the people of Tirana truly enjoy freedom and happiness.

	This year marks the 345th anniversary of the official founding of Tirana, but in the long years before liberation, its progress was so slow! For hundreds of years, Tirana has been languishing in the pain of plunder and invasion. The iron hooves of the Turkish invaders trampled it barbarously; the fascist tanks of Germany and Italy pressed on its chest; in its heart—the central square and avenues—hundreds of patriots unyieldingly shed their last drop of blood under the machine guns of German fascism. As for the feudal dynasties, landlord compradors, and bureaucrats who were willing to be lackeys, they ruthlessly exploited the broad masses of working people. Before liberation, Tirana didn't even have a decent factory, and the goods on store shelves were all imported. The vast majority of citizens were illiterate, and the city had only one dilapidated hospital. People struggled year-round on the verge of death from unemployment, hunger, and disease.

	But in the short fifteen years since liberation, Tirana has become a brand-new socialist city. It is not only the political, economic, and cultural center of Albania but has also become a bright lighthouse on the Adriatic coast for building socialism and maintaining peace.

	For fifteen years, Tirana has changed its face at an astonishing pace. In the past, it was completely a dilapidated and backward consumer city, but in 1958, its industrial output value increased by 18.6 times compared to 1938. A modern, new industrial area has appeared in the western suburbs of the city. This used to be a swampy area, but today you see rows of factory buildings, towering chimneys, and worker residences. There is the Stalin Textile Integrated Factory with an annual output of 20 million meters of cotton cloth, the Gottwald Shoe Factory with an annual output of 600,000 pairs of leather shoes, the iron factory named after Enver Hoxha, the beloved leader of the Albanian people, the agricultural machinery factory named after the guerrillas, as well as glass factories, woodworking factories, and the food integrated factory under construction, and so on. On the beautiful Dajti Mountain, there is the "Lenin" Hydroelectric Power Station, a symbol of Albanian-Soviet friendship. Nestled at the foot of the mountain is the "New Albania" Film Studio, equipped with the latest equipment.

	The past backwardness in culture and poor sanitary conditions have long been changed. In 1938, Tirana had only fourteen primary schools, three seven-year schools, and three middle schools, with a total of only more than 5,000 students, but now there are sixty primary and seven-year schools alone, with a total of more than 21,000 students. In September 1957, Albania's first comprehensive university, the University of Tirana, was founded, opening the doors of higher education to the children of workers and peasants. Today, the number of students studying happily at this university is twice the total number of middle school students in the past. Last year, the first group of doctors, engineers, and agronomists graduated from the gates of higher education.

	In the fifteen years since liberation, the people's government has carried out large-scale municipal construction, first of all, to improve the people's living conditions. Currently, on both sides of every radial road extending from the city center, there are tall buildings of three to five stories. In recent years alone, more than 6,000 new houses have been built. Old Tirana was full of dust when the wind blew and mud on the streets when it rained, but now all the main streets have been paved with asphalt, and the newly installed sewers are eighty kilometers long. In the past, citizens had to pay a high price for a bucket of water, carrying it into the city from Dajti Mountain several kilometers away with small donkeys, but today, every street and every household can get sweet tap water simply by turning on the faucet.

	Albanian comrades proudly call Tirana a large garden, which is an apt metaphor. Just look down from a high place, and you can see that the entire city is in a sea of trees, and the entire urban area is full of flower beds. Green lawns, fragrant roses, graceful chrysanthemums, and beautiful cannas adorn Tirana into a flower market that never fades. There are more than 160 gardens of all sizes in the city, with an average of seven square meters of green space per citizen.

	The newly created ballet opera house, drama theater, variety theater, puppet theater, and cinema, as well as the newly built stadium, have greatly enlivened the cultural, recreational, and sports life of the citizens. Young people who can sing and dance have organized various amateur cultural and recreational organizations, including more than 2,400 singing, dancing, and drama groups. With the development of production and construction and the expansion of the city, the population of Tirana has increased from 58,000 at the time of liberation to more than 130,000 at present.

	The people of Tirana, like all the Albanian people, are never satisfied with their achievements. They want to build their city even more magnificent and beautiful. Comrades from the Tirana Municipal Executive Committee said that a beautiful vision has unfolded before us. Tirana will build more factories, such as the food integrated factory with 3,000 workers, the confectionery factory, the bread factory with a daily output of 110 tons, and the brewery with an annual output of 100,000 liters of beer, etc. The television station under construction will send the latest news and colorful programs to the homes of the capital's people. The Palace of Culture, with the foundation personally laid by Comrade Khrushchev, is not only a crystallization of Albanian-Soviet friendship but will also become the cultural center of the people of Tirana. In the near future, citizens will be able to enjoy rare birds and animals and exotic flowers and plants in the zoological and botanical gardens. In the southern suburbs of Tirana, an artificial lake with an area of ​​35 hectares will appear, which will become the capital's water park, where people can go boating on the crystal clear lake. In the near future, Tirana will become younger and more beautiful.

    人民首都地拉那
    在阿尔巴尼亚获得新生十五周年的喜庆的节日里，首都地拉那到处呈现一片喜气洋洋的景象。在市中心的民族英雄——斯坎德培广场上，在全市高大的建筑物上，到处挂满了巨幅的标语，鲜艳的彩旗迎风招展；市政工人忙着用长青的松树和万紫千红的鲜花来美化城市，几乎全市的建筑物都已粉刷一新。歌剧院、话剧院、杂剧院，都排练出最精彩的节目，电影院在上演歌颂解放战争的影片“风暴”，宽银幕电影在节日里第一次和观众们见面。当日落西山时，新安装起来的日光灯又把全城照耀得如同白昼，欢乐的人们成群结队，挤满街头，欣赏节日的夜景，而这种美好的情景只有在阿尔巴尼亚人民夺取了政权、获得了解放以后才出现在人民的首都。只有今天，地拉那人才真正地享受着自由和幸福。
    今年，地拉那正式建城已整整三百四十五周年了，但是在解放以前那漫长的岁月里，它的步伐是多么缓慢啊！数百年来地拉那一直是在被掠夺、被侵略的苦痛呻吟中度过的。土耳其侵略者的铁蹄野蛮地践踏过它；德意法西斯的战车曾压在它的胸膛；在它的心脏——市中心的广场和大道上，数百个爱国者在德国法西斯的机枪口下不屈地流尽了他们最后的一滴血。至于甘做走狗的封建皇朝、地主买办和官僚们更是敲骨及髓地剥削着广大劳动人民，以至解放前的地拉那连一个像样的工厂都没有，商店货架上的商品都是进口的。市民绝大多数是文盲，全市仅有一所破旧的医院，人们终年挣扎在失业、饥饿和疾病的死亡线上。
    但在解放后短短十五年的今天，地拉那已变成一个崭新的社会主义城市。它不仅是阿尔巴尼亚政治、经济和文化的中心，并且已成为亚得里亚海边的一座建设社会主义、维护和平的明亮灯塔。
    十五年来地拉那以惊人的步伐改变了自己的面貌。过去，它完全是一个破旧落后的消费城市，但1958年工业产值已比1938年增加了十八点六倍。一个现代化的新型工业区出现在城市的西郊。这里原来是一片沼泽地带，但今天呈现在你眼前的是成排的厂房、冲天的烟囱和一片又一片的工人住宅。这儿有年产二千万米棉布的斯大林纺织联合工厂，有年产六十万双皮鞋的哥特瓦尔德皮鞋厂，有以阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查的名字命名的铁工厂，有以游击队名命名的农业机械厂，以及玻璃厂、木器厂和正在兴建中的食品联合工厂，等等。而在秀丽的达伊蒂山上，则有标志着阿苏友谊的“列宁”水电站。紧靠山脚下的是拥有最新设备的“新阿尔巴尼亚”电影制片厂。
    过去文化落后和卫生条件低劣的面貌早已改变了。1938年地拉那只有十四所小学、三所七年制学校和三所中学，学生总数仅五千多人，但现在单小学和七年制的学校就有了六十所，学生共二万一千多人。1957年9月创办了阿尔巴尼亚第一所综合性的大学——地拉那大学，为工农子弟打开了高等学府的大门。今天在这所大学里愉快学习的学生比过去中学生的总数还要多二倍。去年从高等学校的大门走出了第一批医生、第一批工程师、农学家。
    解放十五年来人民政权进行了大规模的市政建设，首先是改善了人民的居住条件。目前从市中心向四面八方伸展的每一条放射线的道路两旁，都是三层到五层的高大楼房，单最近几年来新建的住宅就达六千多幢。旧日的地拉那是刮风满天土，下雨满街泥，而现在所有的大街都铺上了柏油，新安置的下水道长达八十公里。过去市民们为了一桶水得花费很大的代价，从几公里外的达伊蒂山上用小毛驴驮进城来，而今天每一条街，每一户人家只要打开水龙头就可得到甘甜的自来水。
    阿尔巴尼亚同志骄傲地把地拉那称作是一个大花园，这是一个恰当的比喻。只要登高俯瞰，就可看到全城尽在一片树海之中，整个市区内到处是花团锦簇的花坛。绿茵茵的草坪，芬香的玫瑰、多姿的菊花、挺秀的美人蕉把地拉那点缀成永不雕谢的花市。全城大小花园共一百六十多个，平均每个市民有七平方米的绿化面积。
    解放以后新创建的芭蕾舞歌剧院、话剧院、杂剧院、木偶剧院和电影院以及新建的体育场，大大活跃了市民的文娱体育生活。能歌善舞的青年们自己组织了各种业余文娱组织，其中单歌唱、舞蹈、话剧等小组就有二千四百多个。随着生产建设的发展和城市的扩建，地拉那的人口从刚解放时的五万八千人增加到了目前的十三万多人。
    地拉那人像全体阿尔巴尼亚人民一样，他们永远不满足已得的成就，他们要把自己的城市建设得更加壮观美丽。地拉那市执行委员会的同志说，一幅美好的远景已在我们的面前展开了。地拉那将兴建更多的工厂，像拥有三千工人的食品联合厂、糖果厂，日产一百一十吨的面包厂，年产十万公升的啤酒厂等。正在兴建中的电视台将把最新的消息和丰富多彩的节目送向首都人民的家里。由赫鲁晓夫同志亲自破土的文化宫，不仅是阿苏友谊的结晶，并将成为地拉那人民的文化中心。而在不久的将来，市民更可在动植物园中欣赏珍禽异兽和奇花异草。在地拉那的南郊，将出现一个面积达三十五公顷的人工湖，它将成为首都人民的水上公园，人们将可在晶莹的湖面上泛舟荡漾。不久的将来，地拉那将会变得更年轻、更美丽。
