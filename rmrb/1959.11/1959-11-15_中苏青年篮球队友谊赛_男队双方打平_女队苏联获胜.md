Xinhua News Agency, November 14th: Over seven thousand Beijing spectators watched the first friendly matches between the Chinese and Soviet youth men's and women's basketball teams with great interest this evening at the Beijing Gymnasium. As a result, the Chinese youth men's basketball team tied with the Soviet national youth men's basketball team with a score of 76 to 76. The Soviet national youth women's basketball team defeated the Chinese youth women's basketball team with a score of 69 to 66.

These were two extremely tense basketball friendly matches. The men's teams tied a total of ten times throughout the game, and the women's teams tied a total of eight times. It was difficult to determine the winner until the last few seconds of the game.

With only a dozen seconds remaining in the men's game, the visiting team was still leading 76 to 75. But at this moment, the visiting team's newly substituted player Astakhov (number 8) committed a foul while stealing the ball, and Qian Chenghai of the Chinese youth team scored one point on the free throw, resulting in a tie.

In this friendly match, the visiting team took advantage of their height advantage and used more positional attack tactics, while the home team used its speed advantage and tried to win with speed. The competition was fierce. The first half tied nine times, and the visiting team led 39 to 34 at the end of the first half. The visiting team's main center, the giant Rezhava (number 10), who is two meters and eight centimeters tall, posed a great threat to the home team. He was substituted after committing five fouls after thirty minutes of the game, but he scored a total of twenty-five points by himself. Yang Boyong of the home team performed excellently today, scoring a total of twenty-eight points.

The Chinese youth women's team led in scoring for most of the game today. They once led by ten points at 28 to 18 in the first half, but later had more passing errors and lax defense, allowing the visiting team to narrow the score to 38 to 40 at the end of the first half.

The second half was fiercely contested, with six ties. With only nine seconds remaining in the game, the home team was still leading 66 to 65. However, Fu Bin, the tallest center (one meter and eighty-one and a half centimeters) of the home team, made consecutive defensive and inbound passing errors, allowing Dronova (number 4), the shortest player (one meter and sixty-five centimeters) of the visiting team, to score two points on free throws and two points on a field goal, ultimately turning defeat into victory.

After the friendly matches, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu and Vice Premier He Long, accompanied by Soviet Ambassador to China Chervonenko, met with the athletes of both sides on the field. At this moment, warm applause rang out from the audience.

    中苏青年篮球队友谊赛
    男队双方打平　女队苏联获胜
    新华社14日讯　七千多名北京观众今晚怀着极大兴趣，在北京体育馆比赛馆观看了中、苏两国青年男、女篮球队的第一次友谊比赛。结果中国青年男子篮球队同苏联国家青年男子篮球队以七十六比七十六打成平局。苏联国家青年女子篮球队以六十九比六十六战胜了中国青年女子篮球队。
    这是两场极为紧张的篮球友谊赛。男子队全场双方共十次打成平局，女子队共八次打成平局。比赛到最后几秒钟时还很难分出胜负。
    男子队距离比赛还剩最后十几秒钟时，客队还以七十六比七十五领先。但正在这时候，客队新换上场不久的队员阿斯塔霍夫（八号）抢球犯规，被中国青年队钱澄海罚中一分，最后成了平局。
    这场友谊比赛客队利用身材高大的优势，多打阵地进攻战术，主队利用速度快的特点，力图以快制胜，双方争夺激烈，上半场曾九次打成平局，上半场比赛结束时客队以三十九比三十四领先。客队主力中锋、身高两米零八的巨人列扎瓦（十号）对主队的威胁极大，他在比赛进行了三十分钟后因五次犯规被换下，但当时他一个人共得了二十五分。主队杨伯镛今天表演出色，全场共得了二十八分。
    中国青年女子队今天大部分时间得分领先，上半场一度以二十八比十八领先了十分，但后来传球失误较多，防守不严，上半场结束时被客队追成三十八比四十。
    下半场双方争夺激烈，六次打成平局。比赛还剩最后九秒钟时，主队还以六十六比六十五领先。但后来主队身材最高的中锋（一米八十一点五）傅彬连续防守、发界外球失误，被客队身材最矮（一米六十五）的队员德罗诺娃（四号）罚中两分、投中两分，最后反败为胜。
    友谊比赛结束以后，董必武副主席、贺龙副总理由苏联驻华大使契尔沃年科陪同，到球场上接见了双方的运动员。这时观众中响起了热烈的掌声。
