Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 17th: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Red Flag" published a special edition today, calling on democratic forces to unite with all Japanese people to strive for the successful holding of the eighth, ninth, and tenth national unified actions, in order to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

"Red Flag" accused the U.S.-Japan reactionaries of attempting to fully revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The newspaper pointed out that the Japanese people's opposition to this conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi government, and their struggle for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality, is not only a struggle to safeguard the interests of the Japanese nation and people, but also an international task undertaken by the Japanese people.

"Red Flag" said that the joint statement of the Chinese and Japanese Communist Parties clearly pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people. The newspaper condemned the Japanese reactionary ruling class for colluding with the United States and implementing a policy of hostility towards China. The newspaper said that the history of the past ten years is a history of the painful failure of every provocation by U.S. imperialism against China.

"Red Flag" emphasized that the struggle of the Japanese people, centered on the working class, against the revision of the "Security Treaty" and against "enterprise rationalization" is rising day by day. People from all walks of life, such as peasants, youth, women, and intellectuals, have risen to participate in this struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 17th: The "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty" decided at a meeting of its executive committee held on the 16th to launch the eighth unified action to prevent revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" nationwide on the 27th.

At that time, 80,000 union members, farmers, students, and women in Tokyo will be divided into four routes to hold demonstrations and marches, and then petition the Diet.

Throughout Japan, 700,000 union members will participate in this unified action.

On the 21st and 25th, rallies will be held at various workplaces in Tokyo to demand the cessation of negotiations on the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and members of the Japanese Socialist Party's Diet will deliver speeches at these rallies; at the same time, 300,000 leaflets opposing the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will be distributed to citizens at thirty locations in Tokyo.

On the 21st, Tokyo will also hold a "Tokyo General Mobilization Rally to Demand the Cessation of Revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty" in five parks, centered on representatives of unions, students, women, and cultural groups, and then hold a demonstration.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 17th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi admitted in response to questioning at a meeting of the House of Councillors Budget Committee held on the 16th that he plans to visit Washington at the end of this year or the beginning of next year in order to sign a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" with the U.S. government. He said that because the current negotiations on the revision of the "Security Treaty" are coming to an end, he hopes that this new treaty can be approved at the ordinary Diet session to be held in mid-December.

Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, in answering questions at this committee meeting, reiterated what he said in his interim report to the Diet on the revision of the "Security Treaty": The area covered by the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will be centered on Japan, including the area north of the Philippines, the coastal area of China, and the Primorsky Krai of the Soviet Union. Fujiyama also said that when Japan faces a "direct attack," U.S. forces will "take action for the security of Japan"; "in order to defend Japan, it is necessary to allow the United States to use its bases in Japan."

    据新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天出版专刊，号召民主力量同全体日本人民团结起来，为胜利举行第八次、第九次和第十次全国统一行动而努力，以便阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”。
    “赤旗报”指责美日反动派企图全力修改日美“安全条约”。报纸指出，日本人民反对美帝国主义和岸信介政府的这种阴谋以及为争取和平、独立、民主、中立而展开的斗争，不仅是维护日本民族和人民利益的斗争，而且是日本人民担负的国际任务。
    “赤旗报”说，日中两国共产党联合声明清楚地指明，美帝国主义是日中两国人民的共同敌人。报纸谴责日本反动统治阶级勾结美国，执行敌视中国的政策。报纸说，十年来的历史是美帝国主义对中国的每次挑衅都遭到惨痛失败的历史。
    “赤旗报”强调指出，以工人阶级为中心的日本人民反对修改“安全条约”和反对“企业合理化”的斗争正在日益高涨。农民、青年、妇女、知识分子等各阶层人民纷纷起来参加了这个斗争。
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本“阻止修改日美安全条约国民会议”在16日举行的干事会会议上，决定在27日在全国范围内展开阻止修改日美“安全条约”的第八次统一行动。
    届时，东京将有八万工会会员、农民、学生和妇女分为四路举行示威游行，然后向国会进行请愿。
    在日本全国各地，将有七十万工会会员参加这次统一行动。
    在21日和25日两天，将在东京都内的各个工作场所举行要求停止关于修改日美“安全条约”的谈判的集会，日本社会党国会议员将在这些集会上发表演说；同时，将在东京都内的三十处场所向市民散发三十万张反对修改日美“安全条约”的传单。
    在21日，东京还将有三万市民以工会、学生、妇女和文化团体的代表们为中心，在五个公园中举行“要求停止修改日美安全条约东京总奋起大会”，然后举行示威游行。
    据新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介在16日举行的参议院预算委员会会议上答复质询时承认，他计划于今年底或明年初访问华盛顿，以便同美国政府签订新的日美“安全条约”。他说，由于目前举行的关于修改“安全条约”的谈判即将结束，他希望这项新条约能在12月中旬举行的国会平时会议上批准。
    日本外务相藤山爱一郎在这次委员会会议上回答质询时，重申他在国会中发表的关于修改“安全条约”的临时报告中说的话：新的日美“安全条约”所包括的地区将以日本为中心，包括菲律宾以北地区、中国沿海地区和苏联滨海边疆地区等。藤山还说，当日本面临“直接进攻”时，美国军队将“为日本的安全采取行动”；“为了保卫日本，就必须让美国使用它在日本的基地”。
