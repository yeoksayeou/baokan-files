Taking Concrete Measures to Cultivate Teachers; Building Teaching Equipment with Their Own Hands: Tianjin's Newly Established Institutions of Higher Education Advance Vigorously

(Our Report) Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, fifteen new institutions of higher education have been established in Tianjin. After a year of efforts, each school has grown rapidly. Now, the faculty, students, and staff of each school are vibrant and full of confidence, striving to improve the quality of teaching and moving forward by leaps and bounds.

After the establishment of the new institutions of higher education, some people believed that the quality of teaching was not high, there were few old professors, and the equipment was not good enough. A few people with serious right-leaning thoughts and right opportunists even stood aside and issued various criticisms. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Party committees of each school resolutely refuted these erroneous ideas and led the teachers and students to implement the Party's education policy, oppose right-leaning tendencies, muster their energy, and solve the difficulties and problems that arose during the establishment of the schools.

The shortage of old professors, the large number of new teachers, and the lack of teaching experience were prominent problems in the establishment of the new institutions of higher education. The Party committees of each school took various effective measures to actively cultivate teachers. Some were sent to other cities for further study, some were detached from work to study at universities in the city, and others participated in short-term training classes or part-time studies while working. According to statistics from five new institutions of higher education in Tianjin, 89 people were detached from work for further study outside the school. Some institutions of higher education are actively preparing teachers for opening new courses in the second semester of the next academic year. The Hebei Institute of Technology currently has 18 teachers studying electrical engineering and chemical engineering, preparing to open courses. For teachers who have already started teaching, each school also takes various measures to improve their teaching level. Under the education and cultivation of the Party, the new teachers of each school are enthusiastic and energetic, and they are very serious about preparing lessons and giving trial lectures. Many new teachers have adopted the method of collective lesson preparation, collectively researching and discussing, and frequently seeking the opinions of old teachers and listening to special lectures by old teachers. Through various efforts, the quality of teaching has been rapidly improved.

Insufficient equipment, poor teaching conditions, and the lack of practice factories and sufficient laboratories were also difficulties faced by the newly established institutions of higher education. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the teachers and students of each school resolutely implemented the principle of running schools diligently and thriftily, overcoming these difficulties. The Tianjin Institute of Architectural Engineering built the school while ensuring good teaching. Teachers designed and students and teachers constructed together, building four classrooms, twenty-four single-story houses, and one practice factory in three months. The Party and the government have given great care and support to the newly established institutions of higher education, providing tremendous help in terms of materials, finances, and manpower. Over the past year, the basic construction work of the newly established institutions of higher education has gradually been enriched and expanded along with the long-term planning of the schools. The equipment in laboratories, reading rooms, and labor practice factories is growing rapidly, and teaching conditions are becoming increasingly better. The Tianjin Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering has only two departments, power and machinery, but has established seven laboratories in terms of teaching equipment, as well as a mechanical and electrical factory with complete equipment that can produce machines. The Tianjin Normal College has purchased 100,000 books in the year since its establishment, and the microscopes purchased can provide each student in the biology department with one for experiments. The Hebei Institute of Light Industry currently has 1,000 students, and the practice factories opened for each major include wineries, paper mills, mechanical and electrical factories, and riboflavin factories. In addition, the new schools also have the same superior conditions as the old schools, and can go to various factories to work and come into contact with all kinds of modern and new machines. Students of the new course of chemical fiber major opened by the Hebei Textile Institute can intern in the most modern and newly built man-made fiber factory. Contact with all kinds of machines and participation in labor in various factories provides good conditions for improving the quality of teaching.

Party committees at all levels have conscientiously strengthened their leadership over the newly established institutions of higher education. The Hebei Provincial Committee and the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have selected a large number of excellent cadres to serve as Party secretaries, presidents, and leaders in teaching and administration in these schools. The provincial and municipal education, industry, and financial and trade departments have also strengthened their leadership over these schools, and frequently study major issues such as teaching in the newly established institutions. Responsible cadres of the provincial and municipal Party and government often go to the schools to understand the situation and personally take on the task of teaching some important political theory courses. Each school has also improved the Party's organization and strengthened ideological and political work. Most schools have established a college and school affairs committee under the leadership of the Party committee, mobilizing the positive factors of all aspects and giving play to the role of collective leadership. Under the leadership of the Party committee, each school has also formulated or revised teaching plans and teaching syllabuses, and properly arranged teaching, productive labor, scientific research, and life issues.

Under the strong leadership of the Party and the efforts of teachers and students, the quality of teaching in the new institutions has rapidly improved, and students' academic performance has improved rapidly. According to a comparison of a class at the Tianjin Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, the number of students with excellent grades in the second semester of the first academic year doubled compared to the first semester. Each institution has implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor, linking theory with practice, enriching students' perceptual knowledge, making books come alive, and understanding rational knowledge thoroughly, learning quickly, and remembering firmly. The practice factory of the Hebei Institute of Technology organizes students to participate in labor according to the teaching plan, and at the same time completes the national production tasks. The products produced in the first semester were 196 belt lathes, 8 wire drawing machines, and 28 electric motors, with an annual output value of 1.2 million yuan. Through the labor of steelmaking and harnessing the Haihe River, the broad masses of teachers and students in the newly established institutions of higher education have greatly enhanced their class perspective and mass perspective, and loving the collective, abiding by discipline, respecting teachers, and striving for progress have become the norm. Taking the road of becoming both red and expert has become the learning goal of the broad masses of young students in the newly established institutions of higher education. (Attached picture)

    采取具体措施培养师资　自己动手充实教学设备
    天津新建高等院校健步前进
    本报讯　1958年大跃进中，天津市新建了十五所高等院校，经过一年来的努力，各个学校都迅速成长起来。现在各校师生员工，正在生气勃勃，信心百倍地提高教学质量，大踏步向前迈进。
    新建高等院校建校以后，有些人认为教学质量不高，老教授少，设备不够好。少数有严重右倾思想的人和右倾机会主义分子更站在一旁发出了各种非难。中共天津市委和各学校的党委坚决地批驳了这些错误思想，并且领导师生们贯彻了党的教育方针，反掉了右倾，鼓足了干劲，解决在建校中出现的困难和问题。
    老教授少，新教师多，缺乏教学经验，这是新建高等院校建校过程中的一个突出问题。各校党委采取了各种有效的措施积极培养师资。有派到其他城市进修的，有脱产在本市高等学校进修的，也有在职参加短期训练班或业余进修的。根据天津市五个新建高等院校的统计，脱产在校外进修的有八十九人。有的高等院校正在积极为第二学年下学期开设新课程准备师资。河北工学院现有十八名教师在进修电工和化工课程，准备开课。对于已经开课的教师，各校也采取各种措施提高他们的教学水平。各校的新教师在党的教育培养下，热情高，干劲大，对备课试讲都非常认真。许多新教师采取了集体备课的方法，集体研究讨论，并经常征求老教师的意见，听取老教师们的专题讲学。经过种种努力，迅速地提高了教学质量。
    设备不足，教学条件差，没有实习工厂和足够的实验室，这也是新建高等学校存在的困难。各校师生在党委领导下，坚决贯彻了勤俭办学的原则，克服了这些困难。天津建筑工程学院边建校，边搞好教学，教师动手设计，师生共同施工，三个月的时间建起了教室四座、平房二十四间，实习工厂一座。党和政府对新建高等院校给予很大的关怀和支持，在物力、财力和人力上给了巨大的帮助。一年来新建高等院校的基本建设工作随着学校的远景规划逐渐充实和扩大。实验室、资料室、劳动实习工厂的设备在迅速增长，教学条件正在变得越来越好。天津机电学院只有电力、机械两系，但在教学设备上已建立了七个实验室，还有一座设备完整、能生产机器的机电厂。天津师范专科学校建校一年来，已购进图书十万册，所购置的显微镜可供生物系学生做试验时每人一架；河北轻工业学院现有学生一千名，为各专业所开设的实习工厂就有酒厂、造纸厂、机电厂、核黄素厂等。此外，新建校还具有和老校同等优越的条件，可以到各工厂去劳动，接触到各式各样近代化的、新式的机器。河北纺织学院所开的新课程——化学纤维专业，学生可以到最现代化的、新建的人造纤维工厂实习。接触各式各样机器和到各类工厂去参加劳动，为提高教学质量提供了良好的条件。
    各级党委都认真加强了对新建高等院校的领导。中共河北省委和天津市委，选派了大批优秀干部，到这些学校担任党委书记、院校长以及教学、行政等方面领导职务。省、市委教育、工业、财贸等部门，也加强了对这些学校的领导，经常研究新建院校教学等方面的重大问题。省、市党政负责干部，经常到校去了解情况，并亲自担任一些重要政治理论课程的讲授工作。各学校也健全了党的组织，加强了思想政治工作。绝大部分学校都建立了党委领导下的院、校务委员会，调动了各方面的积极因素，发挥了集体领导作用。各校还在党委领导下，制定或修订了教学计划、教学大纲，妥善地安排了教学、生产劳动、科学研究和生活问题。
    在党的坚强领导和师生的努力下，新建院校教学质量迅速提高，学生学习成绩进步很快。根据天津机电学院一个班的比较，第一学年第二学期学习成绩优良的学生比第一学期上升了一倍。各院校贯彻了教育与生产劳动相结合方针，理论联系了实际，学生的感性知识丰富了，书读得活了，对理性知识理解透、学得快、记得牢。河北工学院实习工厂按教学计划组织学生参加劳动，同时完成了国家生产任务，上学期生产的产品：皮带车床一百九十六台，拔丝机八台，电动机二十八台，一年生产总值达一百二十万元。新建高等院校的广大师生通过大炼钢铁、根治海河的劳动，阶级观点、群众观点都大为增强，爱集体、守纪律、尊师长、求上进已成为风气。走红专道路已成为新建高等院校广大青年学生的学习目标。（附图片）
