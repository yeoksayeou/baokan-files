Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 26th: TASS reports from Moscow: The diplomatic envoys of the Bandung Conference participating countries to the Soviet Union held a banquet in Moscow on the 25th to entertain Sékou Touré, President of the Republic of Guinea, who is currently visiting the Soviet Union.

Soviet leaders Voroshilov, Kozlov, Mukhitdinov, Furtseva, and others attended the banquet.

Indian Ambassador Menon pointed out in his speech that the respect and care that the President of Guinea received in the Soviet Union shows that when the Soviet government says it is committed to the principles of peaceful coexistence, it is filled with the best wishes.

Chinese Ambassador Liu Xiao pointed out in his speech that the Soviet Union has consistently provided support and assistance to Asian and African countries in their struggle to win and maintain freedom and independence and to develop their own economies. The Soviet Union has always supported the Bandung spirit. The significant efforts made by the Soviet Union in recent times to ease international tensions, especially the visit of Soviet Premier Khrushchev to the United States, have made a tremendous contribution to the struggle for lasting world peace and have created more favorable conditions for the peaceful construction of Asian and African countries. Ambassador Liu Xiao said that we fully and firmly support the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy.

President Touré said in his speech: "The fire ignited in Bandung has spread to the Asian and African peoples who are now engaged in a heroic and tenacious struggle for their liberation." In order to accelerate the process of liberation, in order to accelerate the process of achieving national independence under conditions of freedom and democracy, we must work tirelessly.

Touré believes that it is necessary to convene a new conference of Asian and African countries "to study the overall situation, and at the same time, to study not only the specific programs for consolidating freedom, but also for developing other aspects of life."

Touré said: Our steps in the United Nations must be consistent. This is necessary in order to more quickly implement the policy of liberation and the policy of further development. We must take consistent action and move in the same direction on major issues related to fundamental goals. He said that only through joint action can we achieve our common goals.

Touré pointed out that the people of Guinea fully support the Bandung principles, are loyal to these principles, and will make their own contribution to the cause of liberation of all peoples.

Touré said that the people of Guinea support the efforts made by the Soviet government in seeking peaceful coexistence. He also said that we highly value consolidating the basis of cooperation between the Soviet Union and our country.

Voroshilov said in his speech that the Republic of Guinea and its leaders, headed by President Touré, play an outstanding role in consolidating and expanding the solidarity of Asian and African countries, and in fighting for the noble and humanitarian principles declared by the Bandung, Cairo, and Accra conferences. The Soviet people and government highly appreciate this outstanding role. Voroshilov pointed out that the Soviet Union has always supported and will continue to support the struggles of the Asian and African peoples for freedom, independence, and peace.

Mohammad Kouni, Ambassador of the United Arab Republic, proposed a toast to the further development of friendship between the Republic of Guinea and the Soviet Union, and to the friendship between the Bandung countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 26th: Sékou Touré, President of the Republic of Guinea, and his wife, held a reception at the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow on the 25th.

Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and Touré spoke at the reception. Voroshilov emphasized in his speech that the enthusiasm shown by the Soviet people in welcoming the Guinean government delegation demonstrates the sincere friendship of the Soviet people towards the noble representatives of the freedom-loving Guinean people who are at the forefront of the liberation movement of the African peoples. Voroshilov said: "Our people extend a hand of friendship to you – the representatives of Africa – with joy and genuine excitement. Africa has now spread its powerful arms and bravely defends its freedom and independence."

In his speech, Touré conveyed the trust and friendship of the Guinean people to the Soviet people.
