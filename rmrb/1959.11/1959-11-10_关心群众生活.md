Caring About the People's Lives

    In the countryside, tap water plants have been established, and farmers are drinking clean tap water. This is a victory for the farmers after communization, who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to struggle against nature.

    What force motivates people to fight so enthusiastically for the collective interest? Undoubtedly, it is the Party! It is the Party that cares about the people's lives and their health. Chairman Mao told us in "Concern Ourselves with the Well-Being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work" that all practical problems in the lives of the masses are problems we should pay attention to. He wants us to become organizers of the masses' lives. The Nankai District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, with such enthusiasm, supported and organized the masses to build tap water plants, solving a major problem in the masses' lives—the drinking water problem—improving people's health and encouraging the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm, inspiring them to complete production tasks.

    Of course, all new things are more difficult at the beginning. When Nankai District started building tap water plants, some people had doubts, and some even thought it was simply impossible. But facts prove that as long as we exert full effort, strive for the upper reaches, overcome right-leaning conservative ideas, make full use of favorable conditions, and rely on the masses to overcome difficulties, we can build tap water plants quickly, well, and economically.

    关心群众生活
    农村里办起了自来水厂，农民喝到了清洁的自来水。这是公社化后的农民敢想、敢说、敢干的向自然作斗争的一个胜利。
    什么力量推动人们这样热情地为集体利益进行斗争呢？无疑的是党！是党在关心着人民的生活，关心着人民的健康。毛主席在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文中告诉我们，一切群众的实际生活的问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。他要我们成为群众生活的组织者。中共南开区委就是怀着这样满腔的热情来支持、组织群众兴办自来水厂，解决群众生活中的大问题——饮水问题，增进了人民的健康，鼓舞了群众的革命热情，精神奋发地去完成生产任务。
    当然，一切新的事物开头总是比较困难的，南开区开始创办自来水厂时，有些人有怀疑，甚至有些人认为简直不可能。但事实证明：只要鼓足干劲，力争上游，克服右倾保守思想，充分利用有利条件，依靠群众克服困难，就能多快好省地把自来水厂建设起来。
