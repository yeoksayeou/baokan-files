Xinhua News Agency, November 11th—The Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Ministry of Culture, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a banquet tonight to bid farewell to all the artists of the Soviet State Grand Theatre Ballet Troupe.

Zhang Xiruo, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, delivered a farewell speech at the banquet. He said: The visit and performance in our country by the Soviet State Grand Theatre Ballet Troupe and Orchestra, which enjoys worldwide acclaim, has become a major event in our cultural life. People are excitedly watching your performances with the feeling that "this music should only be found in heaven, how could one hear it a few times in the human world?" During your short stay in China for a month and a half, 170,000 people have watched your wonderful and exquisite performances. Your incomparably beautiful artistic images will remain in people's minds and will never fade away.

Zhang Xiruo said: During your stay in our country, you not only performed in theaters, but also went deep into factories and people's communes to perform for workers and peasants. You also tirelessly gave our young ballet art a lot of valuable help. All of this fully embodies the profound friendship of Soviet artists and the Soviet people towards the Chinese people. Similarly, I believe that you will also feel the heartfelt, fraternal, immense enthusiasm and respect that the Chinese people have for the Soviet people. Sino-Soviet unity is as solid as a rock, and no force can destroy it. Your visit has undoubtedly made a new contribution to this great friendship.

Kolin, the artistic director of the ballet troupe, spoke on behalf of the Soviet ballet troupe artists. He said that if their art can bring true joy to the Chinese people, they would feel very happy. He expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Chinese people for their warm welcome and reception. He said that they were about to leave China, but their hearts remained in China. He shouted "Long live the great friendship between the Soviet Union and China."

The Soviet Ambassador to China, Chervonenko, also attended the banquet and spoke. He said that the Chinese audience welcomed the performances of the Soviet ballet troupe with all their enthusiasm. The victory and success of the ballet troupe's performances in China are inseparable from our great socialist realism art. He proposed a toast to the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and China and to the great Chinese people.

Tonight, Xia Yan, Ding Xilin, Qu Wu, Yang Hansheng, Ge Baoquan, Mei Lanfang and others attended the banquet. They drank and talked with the Soviet ballet troupe artists, expressing their deep feelings of parting. Before the end of the banquet, Zhang Xiruo presented gifts to the ballet troupe on behalf of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the ballet troupe leader Alechenko presented gifts to Zhang Xiruo on behalf of the ballet troupe.

    欢送苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞团
    新华社11日讯　对外文化联络委员会、文化部和中苏友好协会总会，今晚举行宴会欢送苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞团的全体艺术家们。
    对外文化联络委员会主任张奚若在宴会上致欢送词。他说：满载世界盛誉的苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞团和管弦乐队在我国的访问演出，已经成为我们文化生活中的一件大事。人们都兴奋地抱着“此曲只应天上有，人间那得几回闻”的心绪注视着你们的演出。你们在中国停留的短短的一个半月的时间里，有十七万人观看了你们的精彩绝伦的演出。你们的那些无比优美的艺术形象，将留存在人们的脑海中，永不磨灭。
    张奚若说：你们在我国期间，不但在剧场做了演出，而且还深入到工厂、人民公社，为工人、农民演出，你们还不辞劳苦地给了我国年轻的芭蕾舞艺术以很多宝贵的帮助，这些都充分体现了苏维埃艺术家们和苏联人民对中国人民的深厚的友谊。同样的，我相信，你们也会感到中国人民对苏联人民所怀有的那种出自内心的兄弟般的巨大的热情和敬意，中苏团结坚如磐石，这是任何力量也破坏不了的。你们这一次的访问，无疑地为这一伟大的友谊又做出了新的贡献。
    芭蕾舞团艺术指导柯林代表苏联芭蕾舞团艺术家们讲话。他说，如果我们的艺术能给中国人民带来真正的愉快，这是我们感到非常幸福的。他对中国人民的盛情欢迎和接待表示衷心的感谢。他说，他们就要离开中国，但是他们的心却留在中国了。他高呼苏中两国的伟大友谊万岁。
    苏联驻中国大使契尔沃年科也出席了宴会并且讲了话。他说，中国观众以全部的热情欢迎苏联芭蕾舞团的演出。芭蕾舞团在中国演出的胜利和成功，是同我们的伟大的社会主义现实主义艺术分不开的。他提议为苏中两国牢不可破的友谊和伟大的中国人民干杯。
    今晚，夏衍、丁西林、屈武、阳翰笙、戈宝权、梅兰芳等人都出席了宴会，他们同苏联芭蕾舞团艺术家们饮酒交谈，畅述惜别深情。宴会结束前，张奚若代表对外文化联络委员会向芭蕾舞团赠送了礼品，芭蕾舞团团长阿列钦科代表芭蕾舞团向张奚若赠送了礼品。
