The Sentinel Guarding the Forest Sea - Yu Deming
Du Shentao, Hu Hanbin

On the Mengzhu Ridge, where mountains overlap, peaks rise and fall, and forests are lush and green, stands a peak that pierces straight into the clouds. On top of the peak stands a tower-like forestry post. To protect the forest wealth of the motherland, the soldier guarding the post, with his eagle-like sharp eyes, watches the boundless forest sea day and night, vigilantly monitoring the forest's greatest enemy - wildfires. This is Yu Deming, the forest fire prevention worker and National Model Worker in Forestry, who has been stationed at the central observation post of Zhengchong Yuan in the Jianghua Forestry Area of Hunan for five years.

One morning in October, we followed the representatives of the provincial on-site meeting on forest fire prevention, treading the rugged mountain road, climbing over countless mountain ridges shaded by trees, and finally managed to reach this steep peak over a thousand meters high. Here we visited Comrade Yu Deming.

Yu Deming is a simple, honest, and kind farmer, and also a communist fighter with a strong will, courageous in overcoming difficulties, and wholeheartedly dedicated to contributing everything to the people's cause. In the winter of 1955, he went up the mountain with simple luggage and an ambitious heart. This was a deserted peak with piercing mountain winds. But because he had a strong will to dedicate his life to the cause of the Party, many arduous difficulties were overcome by him. Here, water had to be carried from the mountainside four miles away in bamboo tubes. Besides cooking and drinking, the water in the two bamboo tubes was only enough to wet a towel for washing the face.

During the winter and spring seasons, when forest fires are most frequent, thick smoke often appears suddenly in the forest area. At that time, without a telephone to report the fire, he had to run to deliver the fire report on foot every time. One afternoon, a fire broke out in Xiliu Township. He ran eight or nine miles to the Eighth District government (now Shuikou People's Commune) to report the fire in half an hour, and it was already dark when he returned. But after returning, he found that a fire had started in Jianzhuping, so he groped his way in the dark to report to the district government again. This time he returned to the observation post at eleven o'clock at night. In this late hour, several mountain fires on the Guangxi border spread again. At this time, although Yu Deming was already exhausted, he was energized when he thought of the wealth of the motherland. He finally groped his way down the mountain again. By the time he came back this time, it was already past two o'clock in the morning. The next day, as soon as the east turned white, he lifted the quilt and guarded the observation post again. But in less than half an hour, he began to doze off. No matter how sleepiness entangled him, he dared not sleep. When he opened his big eyes and saw this endless stretch of Chinese fir forest extending to the horizon, he couldn't help but think of the suffering he had endured in the old society and the happiness the new society had given him. When he was young, he begged for rice to support his elderly mother; after he grew up, he worked as a long-term worker for the landlord, planting trees for half his life, but not a single mountain or tree was his own; it was not until after liberation that he was allocated mountains, fields, and houses. He also remembered what the county magistrate said to him at the model worker meeting: The forests of the motherland and the property of the people are entrusted to you to protect, you are the eyes of the forest. All this encouraged him to overcome his drowsiness and watch over this lovely forest sea.

The most difficult thing in guarding the observation post was the invasion of storms. The small wooden house standing on the mountain peak was like a small cage hanging in the sky whenever a strong wind blew. In the five years he has been guarding, he has experienced five of the biggest storms. On the evening of July 25th this year, the heavy rain mixed with thunder and lightning seemed to overturn the sky. Suddenly, the lightning shattered twelve pieces of glass on the observation post, the lightning rod was damaged, and the telecommunications machine and skin line were also smashed. Under the attack of the storm, he rolled down from the platform and passed out. It took a long time before he slowly regained consciousness. But the first thing he thought of after he woke up was not his own body, but the telecommunications machine, binoculars, lightning rod... So he got up and went upstairs to look at these things. When he found that the telecommunications machine and the lightning rod were broken, he was very anxious, because he understood that the telephone was his only means of communication, and if he did not repair it quickly, how could he work? He didn't even eat, so he carried the telephone to Shuikou Town for repair.

In these five years of battle, because he immediately reported fire alarms to the local government and the county forest fire prevention headquarters, the forest resources of the motherland were not damaged. In the two years of 1955 and 1956 alone, he discovered 119 fire alarms. This year, of the 18 fire alarms that occurred in the county, 15 were immediately extinguished because he reported them by telephone.

Yu Deming, this strong forest sentinel, overcame various difficulties in this way and protected the forest resources of the motherland. Jianghua Yao Autonomous County has not had a forest fire in three years, and he has also made a contribution. (Attached picture)

    守卫着林海的哨兵——余德明
    杜慎桃　胡汉斌
    在万山重叠、山峦起伏、林木葱翠的萌渚岭上，矗立一座笔直插入云霄的山峰，山峰顶上，挺立一座塔式的护林岗哨。为了保护祖国的森林财富，守卫在岗哨的战士，以他鹰隼犀利的两只眼睛，日日夜夜了望着漫无边际的林海，警惕地监视着森林的最大敌人——山火。这就是在湖南江华林区正冲沅的中心了望台上坚守五年的护林防火员、全国林业劳动模范余德明。
    10月的一个清晨，我们随着全省护林防火现场会议的代表，踏着崎岖的山路，爬过无数座林木遮天的山岭，好容易才登到这座一千多米高的陡峰。在这里我们访问了余德明同志。
    余德明是一个淳朴、忠厚、善良的农民，也是一个意志坚强、勇于克服困难，忠心耿耿为人民事业贡献出自己一切的共产主义战士。1955年的冬天，他带着简单的行李和一颗雄心上了山。这是一个没有人烟、山风刺骨的山峰。可是由于他具有为党的事业献出自己一生的坚强意志，许多艰巨的困难都被他战胜了。在这里，用水要从四里外的山腰用竹筒背上来。两个竹筒的水除了煮饭、喝水以外，洗脸就只有把手巾打湿擦一擦。
    在山火最多的冬春两季，林区时常出现突起的浓烟。当时，没有电话报警，他每次都要用两条腿奔跑去送火情。一天下午，西流乡起火了，他以半小时的时间跑了八、九里陡岭到八区区政府（现在水口人民公社）报告火情，回来已天黑了。但回来以后，他又发现箭竹坪起了火，于是他又摸着黑路再到区政府去报告。这次他回到了望台，已经是深夜十一点钟了。在这个深夜里，广西边界的几处山火又蔓延开了。这时候，余德明虽然已经精疲力竭，可是，他一想到这是祖国的财富，劲头就上来了。他终于摸着黑又下了一次山。等这次回来，已是两点多钟了。第二天东方才发白，他就掀开被子又守卫在了望台上了。可是还不到半个小时，他就打起瞌睡来。不管睡魔怎样纠缠，他也不敢睡觉。当他睁开两只大眼，望见这连绵不尽的杉木林一直伸展到天边时，他就不自主的想起了自己在旧社会所受的痛苦和新社会给他的幸福。年幼的时候，讨米养活年老的母亲；长大了以后，给地主做长工，栽了半辈子树，却没有一块山、一根树是自己的；直到解放后才分到山、田和房子。又想起在劳动模范会上县长对他说的话：祖国的森林、人民的财产，交给你保卫，你就是森林的眼睛。这一切鼓舞着他战胜了瞌睡，注视着这片可爱的林海。
    守望在了望台上最艰难的还是狂风暴雨的侵袭。矗立在山峰上的小木房子，每当刮大风的时候，就像挂在天空中的一个小笼子。在他守望的五年中，一共经历了五次最大的暴风雨。今年7月25日的这个晚上，大雨夹着雷电像是把天都要翻下来似的。突然雷把了望台上的十二块玻璃震得粉碎，避雷针也坏了，电信机和皮线也被砸坏。在暴风雨的袭击下，他从台上滚下来，昏迷过去，过了很久才慢慢的清醒过来。可是他苏醒后第一个想到的不是自己的身体，而是电信机、望远镜、避雷针……。于是他爬起来上楼去看这些东西，当他发现电信机、避雷针坏了的时候，心里非常着急，因为他明白电话机是他唯一的联系工具，如果不把它很快修好，怎样进行工作呢？他饭也没吃，就背着电话机去水口镇修理。
    在这五年的战斗里，由于他发现火警立即报告当地政府和县护林防火指挥部，使祖国的森林资源没有受到损失，仅在1955和1956两年，他发现的火警，就有一百一十九次。今年全县发生的十八次火警，由他用电话报告而被立即扑灭的就有十五起。
    余德明，这个坚强的森林哨兵，就是这样的战胜了各种困难，保卫着祖国的森林资源。江华瑶族自治县三年没有发生森林火灾，也有他一份功劳。（附图片）
