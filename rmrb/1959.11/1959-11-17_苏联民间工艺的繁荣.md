    The Soviet National Applied Art and Folk Crafts Exhibition held in Beijing aroused our great interest. The seven hundred and twenty exhibits came from various Soviet republics. There are famous Russian lacquerware, unpainted wood carvings, colored wooden utensils, and Kholmogory bone carvings; Ukrainian drawnwork embroidery and pottery; beautiful Central Asian tapestries; Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian leather goods and other colorful and novel handicrafts, too numerous to mention.
    Some of these crafts are practical works of art for daily life, some are decorative works of art for appreciation and display, and others are exquisite toys and souvenirs. The lush flowers and grasses on the vast land of the Soviet Union have become rich creative materials for folk crafts: the irises on the grasslands, the fiery red Russian hawthorns, and the golden Kuban sunflowers constitute a colorful and ever-changing symphony of colors. Those animals and birds loved by the Soviet people of all ethnic groups: the mighty lion, the alert deer, the endearing bear, as well as the gorgeous turkey and the noble swan, have all been given immortal souls by folk artists. Geometric patterns in various shades are still the beloved artistic language of folk artists. The heroes in Russian and Caucasian epics and legends are linked with the images of modern Soviet people, forming new Soviet modern craft themes.
    All these crafts are created by folk artists by hand. Although they are all locally sourced, unprocessed natural raw materials—wood, clay, stone, flax, or animal bones—they have been transformed by the magical fingers of the people's artists into a new artistic world. It is simple and unadorned, but has great charm and embodies the local customs and regional characteristics of various ethnic groups.
    We are infected by these artworks, and transported into various fantasy worlds by them. Ukrainian colorful embroidered shirts and smooth pottery unfold before our eyes; like sapphire southern "Nights in May", we seem to hear the faint voices of young men and women singing. Those reindeer and little bears, galloping sleighs, will also take people's hearts flying to the icy world of "Azure Russia"; when your gaze falls on any work of art, they will reveal Gogol's humor or hum Pushkin's poems.
    These national songs, folk songs, have different rhythms and timbres, but they also have the common thoughts and feelings of the Soviet family: loving their own national history, loving life, yearning for the future, full of revolutionary optimism, and all have a kind and gentle, deep and simple language, which has become a common feature of the folk art of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union.
    Now folk crafts in capitalist countries all over the world are encountering unprecedented misfortunes. Capitalist large-scale industrial production has destroyed all handicrafts and commodified all daily necessities. Folk art in some capitalist countries is approaching destruction. In the Soviet Union, on the one hand, all daily necessities that can be produced by machines are gradually produced by large factories, replacing the hard labor of craftsmen in the past. On the other hand, traditional folk crafts that cannot be produced by machines are all protected and greatly developed, and folk artists have become dedicated to the service of making art. The Soviet party and government have always given great care to folk crafts since the October Revolution and put forward specific measures.
    Capitalist art is also dominated by the worldview of the dying class, directly destroying the classical art tradition; American imperialism uses cosmopolitanism to destroy the classical and folk art traditions of all nations in the world. These dirty capitalist art trends, like poisonous mushrooms, are poisoning the art of Western European countries—painting and sculpture, and also poisoning arts and crafts, causing them to decline. In the Soviet Union, emphasis is placed on classical traditions and folk traditions, respecting the excellent traditions of all national cultures, and developing them on the basis of tradition to serve modern life, so that both classical art and folk art bloom brilliantly.
    In capitalist countries, there are also a few artists who try to save the misfortune of folk art, but their strength is weak, and they rely solely on personal strength, and they never get government support. Some artists occasionally touch on folk art, but only out of curiosity, or to absorb a little fresh blood from folk art to save the dying life of bourgeois art. In the Soviet Union, folk artists, both male and female, have the opportunity to enter art academies for further study. After receiving education, they return to their beloved original posts. At the same time, socially accomplished artists learn from folk art and directly participate in the improvement of folk art, creating new works according to the laws of folk art; they can also obtain materials, equipment, and orders through handicraft production cooperatives, and specialized research institutions provide assistance and guidance in practice and theory.
    The October Revolution ushered in a new era for all nationalities in the Soviet Union. Due to the unparalleled superiority of this social system, it inevitably brought about economic prosperity and cultural prosperity, and also created prosperity in folk crafts. This exhibition once again provides vivid and powerful proof.

    苏联民间工艺的繁荣
    张仃
    在北京举行的苏联各民族实用艺术和民间工艺品展览会，引起我们浓厚的兴趣。展出的七百二十件展览品，来自苏联各个加盟共和国。有俄罗斯的著名的漆器，不涂色的木雕，与着色的木制器皿，和霍尔莫郭尔的牙雕。乌克兰的挑花刺绣和陶器，中亚细亚美丽的壁毯，立陶宛、拉托维亚、爱沙尼亚的皮件及其它色彩丰富、图案新奇的各种工艺品，不胜枚举。
    这些工艺品，有的是生活中的实用艺术品有的是供欣赏、陈设的装饰艺术品，和精致的玩具与纪念品。苏联广大国土上的繁花茂草，成为民间工艺的丰富的创作资料：草原上的鸢尾花、火红的俄罗斯山楂，金黄的库班向日葵，构成了五光十色，变幻无穷的色彩交响乐。那些苏联各族人民喜爱的走兽与飞禽：威猛的狮子，机警的鹿，憨态可亲的熊，以及艳丽的火鸡，高洁的天鹅，都被民间艺术家赋予不朽的灵魂，各种色调的几何形体图案，也仍旧是民间艺术家热爱的艺术语言。俄罗斯、高加索的史诗、和传说故事中的英雄人物，与现代苏维埃人的形象联系起来，构成了崭新的苏联现代工艺题材。
    所有这些工艺品，全是民间艺人亲手创作的，虽然都是就地取材，未经加工的天然原料，——木材、泥土、石块，亚麻或兽骨，却被人民艺术家的神奇手指，创造出来一个新的艺术世界，它是朴质无华的，但有极大魅力的，具有各民族的乡土情调和地方特色的。
    我们受到这些艺术品的感染，被它带进各种幻想世界，乌克兰艳丽的挑绣衬衣、光洁的陶器、在人们眼前展开；蓝得像宝石一样的南方“五月的夜”，仿佛听到少男少女隐隐的歌声。那些驯鹿和小熊、奔驰的雪橇，又会把人们的心带着飞向冰雪世界的“天青色的露西亚”；当你的眼光投向任何一件艺术品的时候，它们都会向你流露出果戈里的幽默或低吟着普希金的诗歌。
    这些民族的歌、民间的歌，有着各样不同的节奏与音色，但又有着苏维埃大家庭共同的思想与感情：热爱自己民族的历史、热爱生活，向往着未来，充满着革命乐观主义的精神，并都又具有亲切与柔和深沉和朴素的语言，成为苏联各民族民间艺术的共同特征。
    现在全世界资本主义国家的民间工艺正遭到历史上从未遇到过的厄运，资本主义大工业生产，摧毁了一切手工业，并使一切生活日用品商品化，民间艺术在有些资本主义国家，已经接近毁灭。而苏联，一方面使一切生活日用品，可以用机器生产的，都逐渐由大工厂生产，代替手工业者过去艰苦的劳动，另一方面，不能由机器生产的传统的民间工艺，统统得到保护，并大大加以发展，民间艺术家变成专为制造艺术品而服务了——苏联的党和政府在十月革命之后就一直的给民间工艺以极大关怀，并提出具体措施。
    资本主义的艺术，同时受着垂死阶级的世界观所支配，直接破坏古典艺术传统；美帝国主义并以世界主义破坏世界各民族的古典的与民间的艺术传统，这些资本主义肮脏的艺术潮流，像毒菌一样，正毒害着西欧各国的艺术——绘画和雕刻，也毒害着工艺美术，使工艺美术日趋没落。而在苏联，重视古典传统和民间的传统，尊重一切民族文化的优秀传统，并使它在传统基础上又加以发展，为现代生活服务，使古典艺术与民间艺术都开出灿烂的花朵。
    资本主义国家，也有少数艺术家，试图挽救民间艺术的厄运，但是他们力量单薄，只靠个人力量，却从来得不到政府的支持。也有些艺术家，偶而触及民间艺术，不过出于猎奇，或从民间艺术中吸取一点新鲜血液，挽救资产阶级艺术垂危的生命而已。而在苏联，民间的男女艺人都有机会进入艺术院校深造，受到教育以后，再回到他们热爱的原来工作岗位；同时社会上有成就的艺术家们，又向民间艺术学习，直接参加民间艺术改进工作，根据民间艺术的规律，创制新作品；并可以通过工艺生产合作社取得材料、设备和订货，有专门研究机构在实践上和理论上予以协助和指导。
    十月革命给苏联各民族开创了一个崭新的时代，由于这个社会制度无比的优越，就必然带来了经济的繁荣与文化的繁荣，也造成了民间工艺上的繁荣。从这个展览会里又一次得到生动有力的例证。
