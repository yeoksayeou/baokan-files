Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, 27th: The factories and enterprises in Jilin City have launched a mass movement to save coal, achieving great results. In the first ten months of this year, they saved more than 100,000 tons of coal, exceeding the requirements for saving industrial coal put forward by the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China.

In the past few years, only eleven units in Jilin City participated in the work of saving industrial coal, limited to boiler workers. This year, under the call of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, twenty-eight major coal-consuming factories in the city, including Jilin Thermal Power Plant, Jiangbei Machinery Factory, Jilin Paper Mill, Jilin Calcium Carbide Factory, and Jilin Ceramics Factory, participated in the coal-saving competition in various trades such as boilers, coking, kilns, and steam production. During the competition, each factory educated its employees through coal-saving exhibitions, debates, and other forms. After the debate, the boiler workers of Jiangbei Machinery Factory took the initiative to understand the steam consumption and steam consumption time of the production workshops, and implemented the method of supplying steam as needed, supplying large amounts when needed, supplying small amounts when needed, and not supplying steam when not needed, which not only met the production needs but also eliminated waste. As a result, more than one ton of coal was saved per shift. The workers also paid close attention to operation, reducing the combustible material in the slag from 25% in the past to 9%. The Party group of the boiler section of the New China Sugar Refinery carefully studied coal-saving measures before the start of production this pressing season, and helped all workers master advanced operating techniques. As a result, they saved more than 400 tons of raw coal in the first fifteen days of operation.

All coal-consuming units universally regard saving coal as one of the main contents of the economic accounting of the work teams, and publish the accounting results on the same day and shift, so that the employees are well aware of the situation, thereby greatly reducing coal consumption.

Vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, continuously improving equipment, improving technical operations, and promoting advanced experience are the main ways for factories and enterprises in Jilin City to save coal. From April to September, the automotive workshop of Jilin Fertilizer Plant achieved a total of seventeen technical innovations, of which the carbon dioxide steam production method alone can save the country more than 70,000 tons of raw coal a year. The recently successfully tested automatic hydraulic ash removal can also save more than 50 tons of coal per day. In addition, all coal-consuming units have established inspection and acceptance and shift handover systems to strengthen the maintenance and insulation of equipment and plug loopholes in wasting coal.

    锅炉、炼焦、烧窑、造汽等工种展开节煤竞赛
    吉林市节约工业用煤十万吨
    据新华社吉林27日电　吉林市各工厂企业开展群众性的节约煤炭竞赛，取得很大成绩。今年头十个月节约煤炭十万多吨，超过了中共吉林省委提出的节约工业用煤的要求。
    吉林市过去几年节约工业用煤的工作，只有十一个单位参加，仅限于锅炉工种。今年，在中共吉林省委的号召下，全市有吉林热电厂、江北机械厂、吉林省造纸厂、吉林电石厂和吉林市陶瓷厂等二十八家主要用煤工厂的锅炉、炼焦、烧窑、造汽等工种，参加了节约煤炭的各工种竞赛。竞赛中，各厂通过节煤展览会、辩论会等形式向职工进行教育。江北机械厂的职工经过辩论之后，各班司炉工主动到生产车间了解用汽量和用汽时间，按照生产需要实行随用随供、用大供大、用小供小、不用不供的办法，既满足生产需要，又杜绝浪费，结果每班节约煤炭一吨多；工人们并且认真注意操作，使煤渣中的可燃物由过去的占25％降低到占9％。新中国制糖厂锅炉工段党小组在这个榨季开工生产以前就认真研究了节约用煤措施，并且帮助所有工人掌握先进操作技术，结果在开工后的十五天时间内就节约原煤四百多吨。
    各用煤单位普遍把节约用煤作为班组经济核算的主要内容之一，当日当班公布核算结果，使职工们心中有数，从而大大降低了煤耗。
    大闹技术革新和技术革命，不断改进设备，改进技术操作，推广先进经验，是吉林市工厂企业节约用煤的主要途径。吉林肥料厂造汽车间4月份到9月份共实现了十七项技术革新，其中仅二氧化碳造汽法一项，一年就可以为国家节约七万多吨原煤；最近试验成功的自动水力排灰，每天也可以节约五十多吨煤炭。另外，各用煤单位都建立了检查验收和交接班制度，加强对设备的维护和保温，堵塞浪费煤炭的漏洞。
