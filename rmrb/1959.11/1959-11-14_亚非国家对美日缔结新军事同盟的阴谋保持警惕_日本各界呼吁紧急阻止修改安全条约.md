Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch from Tokyo: Various circles in Japan held a rally in Tokyo on the 12th, demanding that the government halt negotiations on revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty." One hundred and ten people participated in the rally, including representatives from the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, major mass organizations, and cultural circles.

    The meeting unanimously passed an appeal calling on all Japanese people to rise up against the government's conspiracy to revise the "Security Treaty" with the United States.

    The appeal stated, "The plan to revise the Security Treaty will bring the Japanese people to the brink of war, although the Kishi Nobusuke government says that revising the Security Treaty is for the sake of Japan's security." The appeal pointed out that China and other Asian and African countries have long been vigilant about the true intentions behind revising the "Security Treaty."

    The appeal stated that the resolution passed by the United Nations Political Committee on comprehensive disarmament indicates that some progress has been made in easing the international situation. The appeal pointed out, however, that the current policy of the Kishi Nobusuke government runs counter to this general trend.

    The appeal concluded, "If the Japanese people, encouraged by this global trend, strive to oppose the dangerous attempts of the Kishi Nobusuke government, they will be able to prevent the revision of the Security Treaty."

    Representatives from various political parties and mass organizations, as well as cultural leaders, spoke at the meeting. They all expressed their determination to make their best efforts to prevent the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" in this critical situation.

    Shigezaburo Suzuki, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, said that the Socialist Party adheres to its policy of opposing the revision of the "Security Treaty."

    Kenji Miyamoto, Secretary-General of the Japan Communist Party, emphasized that there is still great potential among the people that can be mobilized to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty." He emphasized that the movement against the revision of the "Security Treaty" must be developed into a truly national movement, giving full play to the power of the people.

    Kaoru Yasui, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, said that the ruling party's attempt to split the anti-nuclear weapons movement has failed. He said that the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is actively conducting activities against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

    Yoshio Yanagimoto, head of the Political Department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, said that the trade union will hold a general strike to smash the government's conspiracy to revise the "Security Treaty." He said that the working class will stand at the forefront of the people's struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

    Masaru Nozoi, President of the National Federation of Farmers' Associations, said that farmers have held thirty rallies to protest the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" so far, and the number of rallies will soon increase to one hundred.

    Buddhist monk Nishikawa supported the proposal that Kishi Nobusuke should resign. Nishikawa suggested that mass organizations effectively work with Buddhist monks throughout Japan, so that they can participate in the people's struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty." He said: Now is the time for Buddhist monks to respond to the call of the nation.

Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch from Tokyo: The Osaka Prefectural Council of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan decided yesterday afternoon to take the largest-scale struggle to participate in the eighth national unified action against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," scheduled for November 27.

    According to the council's decision, on the 27th, unions in private enterprises in Osaka will hold strikes of more than two hours; coal mine unions will hold workplace meetings during working hours; and public educators who have been deprived of the right to strike will launch a struggle to refuse overtime. At the same time, 50,000 people will be mobilized to hold a prefectural rally in Osaka to stop the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty."

    The council decided that its current struggle goals are: to prevent the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty"; to oppose the "rationalization of the coal mining industry" at the expense of workers' interests; to greatly increase wages and pay year-end bonuses; and to establish a uniform minimum wage system of 8,000 yen.

Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch from Tokyo: Five thousand workers and students held a petition rally in Tokyo today, asking the National Diet to take action to stop the government from revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty."

    The meeting also passed a resolution calling on the National Diet to take immediate measures to normalize diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

    The resolution opposed the National Diet's approval of the compensation agreement signed by the Kishi Nobusuke government with South Vietnam, and opposed the manufacture of American Lockheed aircraft.

    The resolution also called for greatly increasing workers' wages, reducing prices, and taking effective relief measures for typhoon victims and the unemployed.

    The meeting elected twenty representatives to deliver the resolution to members of the National Diet.

    After the meeting, workers and students held a demonstration. Although the police tried to disrupt the procession, the demonstration remained orderly. When the procession reached the "Defense Agency," the thousand students at the front of the procession shouted: "We oppose nuclear armament," "Don't manufacture Lockheed aircraft."

Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch from Tokyo: The Japan Teachers' Union held a central committee meeting in Tokyo today to discuss the national teachers' and staff members' struggle against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and reactionary educational policies.

    Takeshi Kobayashi, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee, emphasized in his speech at the meeting that at a time when the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" is facing a decisive stage, the 500,000 teachers and staff members belonging to the Teachers' Union must do everything possible to smash the "work performance assessment" system and reactionary educational policies, which have become an important part of strengthening the US-Japan "security system," in order to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the "Security Treaty."
