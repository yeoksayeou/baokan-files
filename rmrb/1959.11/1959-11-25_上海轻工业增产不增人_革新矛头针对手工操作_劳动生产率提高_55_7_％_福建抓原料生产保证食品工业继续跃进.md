Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd -- Shanghai's light industry departments are constantly replacing old technologies with new ones, rapidly increasing the degree of mechanization, and universally improving labor productivity. Production has repeatedly leaped forward without increasing the number of people.

This year, the number of employees in Shanghai's light industry system has basically not increased, but the total output value for the first ten months has greatly increased compared to the same period last year, and the labor productivity of employees has increased by an average of 55.7% compared to the same period last year. This achievement is mainly obtained from technological innovation. Especially since the second half of this year, as long as the city's light industry workers see manual operations in the increase production and conservation movement, they target innovation at them. The content of innovation includes almost all industries and all types of work, breaking through many weak links in production and doubling production efficiency. For example, in the thermos bottle industry, factories making bottle liners used to use manual operations for most of the processes from mixing materials, blowing bubbles, annealing, pulling the bottom, sealing, to silvering and vacuuming. Now, mechanical devices are used in every process, and efficiency has increased by an average of two to three times. In the pen-making industry, all twenty-two major production processes, such as tipping with iridium, slitting, and grinding, are now operated mechanically, and production efficiency has increased more than two times. At the beginning of this year, mechanized operation accounted for only 20% of the entire production process in the leather industry, but now it has increased to about 50%. In industries such as daily-use hardware and food, some factories used to have about 80% manual labor, but now mechanical operation accounts for 70% to 80%. Many labor-intensive tasks, such as packaging and handling, have also begun to use machinery.

Shanghai's light industry departments have implemented the policy of combining foreign and indigenous methods in technological innovation. No matter what kind of operation, as long as it can use indigenous methods and indigenous machinery to improve production, it will be used first, and after production is improved, further improvements will be considered. Many indigenous machines look simple and crude on the outside, but they save much more effort than manual operation. The newly built Shanghai Photosensitive Film Factory had manual packaging as a weak link. The workers first used indigenous methods to create more than ten very simple hand-cranked packaging machines, and efficiency immediately increased from more than 100 rolls per person per day to more than 700 rolls. Then, they successfully developed an automatic packaging machine, one of which can replace five hand-cranked machines. As a result, although the fourth quarter's task increased fivefold compared to the third quarter, the packaging section not only did not increase personnel, but also transferred one-tenth of its personnel to support other sections.

At present, technological innovation in Shanghai's light industry departments is continuing to develop in depth. According to statistics from fourteen specialized companies, there are currently more than 5,000 innovation projects underway in equipment alone. Many factories have established technological innovation organizations from the factory and workshop levels to the team level, with dedicated personnel in charge at each level. The specialized companies are also organizing veteran workers and technicians from various factories to conduct technical appraisals of the innovation projects that have already been successfully researched and developed, while organizing exchanges and promotion.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 23rd -- Fujian Province is taking various measures to improve the production of raw materials for the food industry to ensure a continued leap forward in the food industry.

Many food industry departments have now established raw material bases. For example, the Jianyang Winery, in addition to its own raw material base, also cooperates with ten communes in the county to establish raw material bases, planting about 3,000 mu of cassava, and signing purchase contracts for 9.4 million jin. Factories also cooperate in various ways to solve raw material problems. Canned food factories, wineries, and spice factories throughout the province have carried out extensive cooperation in the rational utilization of fruit resources. Canned food factories supply second-grade fruits and fruit cores to wineries for winemaking, and fruit peels are supplied to spice factories for making spices.

While organizing production and strengthening procurement, many factories are also trying every possible means to find and use substitute raw materials. According to incomplete statistics from ten wineries in Xiamen, Huian, Luoyuan, Lianjiang, Shunchang, Jinjiang, etc., various substitutes such as longan kernels, sugarcane bagasse, and wild starch were used for winemaking in the first half of this year, saving 5.57 million jin of grain. This not only reduced costs, but also improved product quality. Lianjiang Winery improved the operating technology of yellow wine, using wine lees for secondary pressing twice, increasing the wine yield, and saving more than 36,000 jin of grain for the country in just three months. Many factories are also vigorously promoting comprehensive utilization, developing multi-variety operations, and improving the utilization rate of raw materials.

    上海轻工业增产不增人
    革新矛头针对手工操作　劳动生产率提高55.7％
    福建抓原料生产保证食品工业继续跃进
    新华社上海23日电　上海轻工业部门不断用新技术代替旧技术，迅速提高机械化程度，劳动生产率普遍提高。在不增加人的条件下，生产一再跃进。
    今年，上海市轻工业系统的职工人数基本上没有增加，但头十个月的生产总值却比去年同期大为提高，职工的劳动生产率比去年同期平均提高了55.7％。这一成就主要从革新技术方面得到的。今年特别是下半年以来，全市轻工业职工在增产节约运动中只要看到哪里还用手工操作，就把革新的矛头指向哪里。革新的内容几乎包括了所有的行业和所有的工种，突破了生产上许多薄弱环节，使生产效率成倍提高。例如，热水瓶工业中做瓶胆的工厂，从拌料、吹泡、退火、拉底、封口一直到镀银、真空，过去绝大部分是手工操作，现在道道工序上都使用机械，效率平均提高两倍到三倍。制笔工业的点铱、开缝、磨尖等二十二道主要生产工序，现在全部用机械操作了，生产效率提高两倍多。今年年初机械化操作在全部生产过程中还只占到20％的皮革工业，现在已经提高到50％左右。日用五金、食品等行业过去有些工厂80％左右是手工劳动，现在机械操作占到70％到80％。有许多很花劳动力的工种，如包装、搬运等，也开始使用机械了。
    上海轻工业部门在技术革新中贯彻了洋法和土法结合的方针。不论哪一种操作，只要能用土办法土机械提高生产的，就先用起来，生产提高了，再进一步考虑改进。许多土机械从外表上看，简简单单，粗粗糙糙，可是比手工操作却省力许多。新建的上海感光软片厂手工包装原是一个薄弱环节，职工们先用土办法搞了十多台非常简单的手摇包装机，效率马上从一人一天包一百多卷提高到七百多卷；接着，他们又研究成功了一种自动包装机，一台可以代替五台手摇机。这样一来，第四季度任务虽然比第三季度增加五倍，包装工段不但没有增加人，还抽出了十分之一的人支援其他工段。
    目前，上海轻工业部门的技术革新还在继续深入发展。据十四个专业公司的统计，现在仅设备方面正在革新的项目就有五千多项。许多工厂从工厂、车间到小组都成立了技术革新组织，层层有专人负责。对已经研究成功的革新项目，各专业公司也正组织各厂老工人和技术人员一边作技术鉴定，一边组织交流推广。
    新华社福州23日电　福建省采取各种措施做好食品工业原料材料生产，保证食品工业继续跃进。
    许多食品工业部门现在都已经建立了原料基地。如建阳酒厂，除自营原料基地外，还和全县十个公社协作建立原料基地，种植木茹三千亩左右，签订收购合同九百四十万斤。各厂还多方协作，解决原料、材料问题。全省罐头厂、酒厂和香料厂，在合理利用水果资源方面进行了广泛协作。罐头厂将次果、果核等供应酒厂酿酒，将果皮供给香料厂制香料。
    在组织生产和加强收购的同时，许多工厂还千方百计地寻找和利用代用原料。根据厦门、惠安、罗源、连江、顺昌、晋江等十个酒厂不完全统计，今年上半年利用龙眼核、甘蔗渣、野生淀粉等各种代用品酿酒，节约粮食五百五十七万斤，不但降低了成本，产品质量也很好。连江酒厂改进黄酒操作技术，利用酒糟两次复榨，提高了出酒率，仅三个月就为国家节约粮食三万六千多斤。许多工厂还大力推行综合利用，发展多品种经营，提高原料的利用率。
