Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 19th. The first Tibetan language drama troupe in Qinghai Province has been performing in pastoral areas and has been warmly welcomed by the Tibetan people.

The drama troupe recently took its first batch of nine newly rehearsed programs to the Daotanghe Commune in Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture for experimental performances. These programs include the one-act plays "Night of Wind and Fire," which exposes the crimes of the reactionary upper strata of Tibet, and "Towards Collectivization," which reflects the socialist revolution in pastoral areas, as well as seven dance programs such as "Happy Commune" and "Rainbow." When the local people heard that the drama troupe was coming, some traveled from forty or fifty li away to watch.

Qinghai Province has five Tibetan autonomous prefectures, and there are also Tibetan people living in concentrated communities or scattered throughout other prefectures, cities, and counties. The establishment of a Tibetan language drama troupe is of great significance for enlivening the cultural life of the Tibetan masses and conducting socialist education for them. This Tibetan language drama troupe was established in February of this year and now has more than 30 actors, directors, and other personnel. Most of them are from the working people of pastoral areas and are familiar with the lives of the Tibetan people. Each actor can sing dozens of folk songs and knows many dance movements.

    青海藏语话剧队下牧区  牧民远道赶去看演出
    据新华社西宁十九日电　青海省第一个藏语话剧队在牧区演出，受到藏族人民的热烈欢迎。
    这个话剧队最近带了第一批新排练的九个节目深入到海南藏族自治州的倒淌河公社作试验性演出。这些节目中有揭露西藏上层反动集团罪恶的“风火之夜”、反映牧区社会主义革命的“走向集体”两个独幕剧目，还有“欢乐的公社”、“彩虹”等七个舞蹈节目。当地人民听说话剧队来了，有的从四、五十里路的外地赶来观看。
    青海省有五个藏族自治州，在其他各州、市、县也都有藏族聚居或散居，成立藏语话剧队对于活跃藏族群众文娱生活和对他们进行社会主义教育有着十分重要的意义。这个藏语话剧队是在今年二月间成立的，现在有演员、导演等三十多人，他们大多出身牧业区的劳动人民，熟习藏族人民的生活。每个演员都能唱出几十个流传民间的歌曲和会许多舞蹈动作。
