Nankai University Holds Scientific Symposium

Nankai University held its Third Scientific Symposium from October 17th to November 1st, at which 88 papers were presented. In addition to faculty and students from the university, more than 1,000 guests from across the country attended the meeting. Professor Urbański, a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences, also participated in the conference.

Regarding the issue of land nationalization in Chinese feudal society, Professors Zheng Tianting and Yang Zhijiu presented reports at the meeting. The research focused on the relationship between political power and economic power, and whether land sales could be regarded as a sign of private ownership. Yang Zhijiu argued that in Chinese feudal society, anyone, even the emperor, generally had to pay a price when occupying land belonging to the people. Therefore, land sales could be regarded as a sign of private ownership. As for the state confiscating or forcibly buying land from some landlords, this was merely a reflection of political power manipulating economic power, and was unrelated to ownership. Zheng Tianting disagreed with Yang Zhijiu's view. He believed that the power of private property should be the power to dispose of things at will, without any interference. The land ownership system in Chinese feudal society could be said to be a private ownership system with a strong state control, which was closer to state ownership than private ownership.

These opinions were supported by some comrades. In addition, some comrades believed that the Chinese feudal land ownership system was a system of public and private ownership coexisting.

Regarding the mainstream and development laws in classical Chinese literature, Associate Professor Wang Dajin argued that progressive realism and romanticism in classical Chinese literature represent the mainstream. Furthermore, Wang Dajin believed that the struggle between progressive literature (especially realist, positive romantic literature) and reactionary, backward literature (especially anti-realist literature) is the fundamental law of the development of classical Chinese literature. He disagreed with the view presented in the literary histories compiled by Peking University and Beijing Normal University that folk literature is the mainstream of classical Chinese literature, and that the law of development of classical Chinese literature is the struggle between realism and anti-realism. However, Wang Dajin believed that the struggle between progressive and reactionary backward literature is only one basic law. Literary art is not only expressed in opposing struggles but also in the mutual connection and mutual restriction of opposing sides, which is also an important law. These opinions sparked lively discussions.

Regarding the biological characteristics and control of bamboo powderpost beetles, a paper presented at the meeting adopted various breeding observations and control test results to clarify the biological characteristics and life patterns of bamboo powderpost beetles, and proposed comprehensive measures with prevention as the main focus. After bamboo is felled, it should first be soaked in water for more than three months, then the cut ends should be sealed, and anti-cracking protection should be strengthened during storage. When using the bamboo, it should be treated with 3% NaF for a short period (if conditions permit, it can be boiled in 3% NaF for two hours and then soaked for six hours, which can also prevent mildew). Experimental results have proven that this type of bamboo, when used in buildings, still shows no signs of insect infestation after two years, and the effect is extremely good.

Regarding the research on organophosphorus insecticides, the Department of Chemistry at Nankai University has recently conducted in-depth research on Cymet-type compounds and found a new drug with low toxicity to humans and animals but high insecticidal efficacy. A total of 40 types of this drug have been synthesized, and preliminary biological assays have found that four types have excellent performance and have been recommended to industrial departments for production. In addition, significant progress has also been made in the study of certain basic theoretical problems (such as the relationship between chemical structure and toxicity) in the synthesis process.

Xi'an Philosophical Circles Criticize "On Negation"

The Philosophy Institute of the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held a meeting to criticize Comrade Chen Yuanfang's erroneous views in an article entitled "On Negation."

Comrades participating in the meeting pointed out that the negation in Marxist dialectics is the struggle and resolution of opposing sides, the revolution of new things against old things, and the qualitative change of things. In the negation of old things by new things, there is inheritance of old things, but the most essential thing is thorough negation. However, the author of "On Negation" said: "What is eliminated are only certain aspects of things, not the entire thing." This fundamentally negates the essential meaning of revolutionary qualitative change in Marxism. The author exaggerates inheritance as the main issue in revolutionary struggle, which fundamentally negates the revolution, the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the leadership of the Party.

Comrades participating in the meeting revealed that in order to confuse the fundamental boundary between the Marxist view of inheritance and the view of revolution, Comrade Chen Yuanfang groundlessly claimed that the reason why the socialist system is superior is because it inherited "positive and useful things" from capitalist society. This fundamentally negates the qualitative change in the development of things and negates the socialist revolution, which is precisely bourgeois reformism and vulgar evolutionism.

Comrades speaking also pointed out that "On Negation" is a sophistry of metaphysical eclecticism in methodology. The author pointed out that there are both affirmation and negation, opposing this and opposing that, opposing both "left" and right, seemingly impartial, but in essence negating and distorting the true development of things and society, denying that things have primary and secondary aspects, and equating essence and phenomenon. In the final analysis, it emphasizes inheritance, denies change, emphasizes quantitative change, denies qualitative change, emphasizes opposing "left," and negates opposing right.

Comrades speaking believed that the article "On Negation" is establishing a theoretical foundation from a philosophical perspective for right-leaning opportunism.

    学术文化动态
    南开大学举行科学讨论会
    南开大学于10月17日至11月1日举行了第三届科学讨论会，会上宣读了论文八十八篇。参加会议的除本校师生外，还有来自全国各地的一千多位来宾。波兰科学院院士乌尔般斯基也参加了会议。
    关于中国封建社会土地国有制问题，会上由郑天挺和杨志玖两位教授提出报告。研究集中于政治权力和经济权力的关系，以及土地买卖是否可以作为私有制的标志。杨志玖认为，在中国封建社会中，任何人、甚至连皇帝要占用民田时，一般也要付出代价。因此，土地买卖可以作为私有制的标志。至于国家没收或强买某些地主土地的事件，只是政治权力愚弄经济权力的一种反映，和所有制无关。郑天挺不同意杨志玖的意见。他认为，私有财产的权力，应当是不受任何干涉、随心所欲处理什物的权力。中国封建社会的土地所有制，可说是国家支配力量较强的私有制，这与其说近于私有，不如说是近于国有。
    以上意见各得到一些同志的支持。另外，还有同志认为，中国封建土地所有制是一种公有和私有并行的制度。
    关于中国古典文学中的主流和发展规律问题，王达津副教授认为，在中国古典文学中，进步的现实主义和浪漫主义的文学是中国古典文学的主流。并且，王达津认为，在中国古典文学中，进步的（特别是现实主义、积极浪漫主义的）文学和反动落后的（特别是反现实主义的）文学的斗争是中国古典文学发展的基本规律。他不同意北京大学和北京师范大学所编文学史中所提出的民间文学是中国古典文学主流的说法，以及中国古典文学发展规律是现实主义同反现实主义斗争这一公式。不过，王达津认为，进步的和反动落后文学的斗争，仅仅是一条基本规律。文学艺术不只表现在对立的斗争上，也表现在对立面的互相联系和互相制约上，这也是一条重要的规律。这些意见引起了热烈的讨论。
    关于竹粉蠹的生物学特性及其防治的研究，会上有一篇论文采用各种饲养观察和防治试验结果，摸清了竹粉蠹的生物学特性及其生活规律，提出了以防为主的综合措施。竹材砍伐后先在水中浸三个月以上，然后将断口封闭，在存放期间加强防裂保护，使用时再以3％的NaF进行短期处理（如有条件，可以用3％NaF先煮二小时，再浸六小时，兼可防霉）。实验结果证明，这种竹材用于建筑物，二年后仍无感染虫害现象，效果极为良好。
    关于有机磷杀虫剂的研究，南开大学化学系最近深入地研究了西麦特类型的化合物，找到了一种对人畜毒性小而对害虫毒效大的新药剂。这种药剂共合成了四十种，经过初步生物检定，发现有四种性能极好，已推荐给工业部门生产。另外，对合成过程中若干基本理论问题（如化学结构和毒性的关系）的研究，也取得了较好的成绩。
    西安哲学界批判“论否定”
    中国科学院陕西分院哲学研究所举行会议，批判陈元方同志在一篇题为“论否定”的文章中的错误观点。
    与会同志指出，马克思主义辩证法的否定是对立面的斗争及其解决，是新事物对旧事物的革命，是事物的质变。在新事物对旧事物的否定中，对旧事物有继承现象，但最本质的却是彻底的否定。而“论否定”的作者却说：“消灭的只是事物的某些方面，而不是整个事物。”这是从根本上否定了马克思主义的革命质变的本质意义。作者把继承夸大为革命斗争中的主要问题，这就从根本上否定了革命、无产阶级专政和党的领导。
    与会同志揭露，陈元方同志为了混淆马克思主义的继承观和革命观的根本界线，竟然毫无根据地认为，社会主义制度之所以优越，是因为继承了资本主义社会中“积极有用的东西”。这是从根本上否定了事物发展中的质变，否定了社会主义革命，这正是资产阶级的改良主义和庸俗进化论。
    发言的同志还指出，“论否定”一文在方法论上是形而上学的折衷主义的诡辩论。作者指出既有肯定，也有否定，既反对这个，又反对那个，既反“左”，又反右，貌似不偏不倚，实质上是否定和歪曲事物和社会真正的发展，否认事物有主次之分，把本质和现象等量齐观。归根结底，强调继承，否认变革，强调量变，否认质变，强调反“左”，否定反右。
    发言的同志认为，“论否定”一文是为右倾机会主义从哲学上建立理论基础。
