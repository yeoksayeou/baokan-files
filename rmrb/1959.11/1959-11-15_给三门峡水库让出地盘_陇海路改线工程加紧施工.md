Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 14th - The Longhai Railway rerouting project within Henan Province is comprehensively accelerating construction.

The Longhai Railway rerouting project stretches from Sanmenxia in the east to Lintong, Shaanxi in the west, with a total length of 214 kilometers. This section of the railway is located in the Sanmenxia Reservoir area and will be completely submerged after the dam is completed. Therefore, the railway must be moved south before the dam is completed and begins impounding water. In order to meet the increasing transportation volume of this section of the line, a double track will also be built during the rerouting process. The rerouting project in Henan Province is 113 kilometers long. The distance of the southward move is about 5 kilometers at the closest point and more than 20 kilometers at the farthest. Along the way, it will pass through 58 large and small mountains and cross 219 large and small rivers and gullies. The highest earth filling during construction reaches 40 cubic meters, and the deepest excavation reaches 40 cubic meters. Along the line, 17 large and medium-sized bridges, 208 small bridges and culverts, and 11 earth tunnels with a total length of more than 7,000 meters will be built.

This project started in the Lingbao and Wentang areas in November last year. During the construction, the workers carried out high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency competitions, creating a variety of advanced construction experiences such as sliding basket soil transportation, steel rail sliding stones, and water flushing soil, which continuously increased labor productivity. As of the 5th, more than half of the subgrade earthwork has been completed, six large and medium-sized bridges and seventy-four small bridges and culverts have been built, and more than 2,800 meters of tunnels have been excavated. After inspection by relevant departments, the project quality is very good. In addition to the road builders, 70,000 workers were transferred from the province to participate in the construction. The three special districts of Xuchang, Kaifeng, and Xinxiang dispatched 100 cars and 500 flatbed carts to participate in the transportation work of the rerouting project. The provincial grain and commerce departments have also taken a series of measures to ensure the supply of a large number of equipment and supplies.

    给三门峡水库让出地盘
    陇海路改线工程加紧施工
    新华社郑州14日电　河南省境内陇海铁路改线工程全面加紧施工。
    陇海铁路改线工程，东起三门峡，西至陕西临潼，共长二百一十四公里。这一段铁路位于三门峡水库区，水库大坝拦洪之后，将全部被水淹没，因此要在大坝拦洪之前必须将铁路往南迁移。为了满足这段线路运输量增长的需要，在改线的同时，还要建设复线。在河南省境内的一段改线工程长一百一十三公里，南移距离近的约五公里，最远的达二十多公里。沿线要穿过五十八个大小山头，跨过二百一十九道大小河沟。施工中填土最高达四十立方米，挖土最深达四十立方米。沿线还要架设十七座大、中型桥梁，二百零八座小桥涵，开凿十一座总长七千多米的土质隧道。
    这项工程，是去年11月在灵宝、温塘一带开始动工的。施工中，职工们开展了高产、高质、高效率竞赛，创造了滑筐运土、钢轨滑石、水冲土等多种多样的先进施工经验，使劳动生产率不断上升。截至5日，全线路基土方工程已完成一半以上，建成大、中桥梁六座，小桥涵七十四座，开凿隧道二千八百多米，经过有关部门检查，工程质量很好。除筑路工人外，全省抽调了七万民工参加了建设，许昌、开封、新乡三个专区出动了一百部汽车、五百辆架子车，投入改线工程的运输工作。省粮食部门和商业部门也采取了一系列的措施，保证了大批器材和生活物资的供应。
