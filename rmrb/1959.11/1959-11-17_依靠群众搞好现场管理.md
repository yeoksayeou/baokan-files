Rely on the Masses to Improve On-site Management
By our reporter, Tang Tianzhen

    The Xieji No. 2 Mine of the Huainan Coal Mine relies on the masses to strengthen on-site production management, giving full play to the enthusiasm of the workers, improving the management level of the enterprise, and ensuring the comprehensive, balanced, and over-fulfilled production tasks.

    On-site management is the foundation of the entire enterprise's production management. If the management of basic production units is improved, the management level and production level of the entire enterprise will be greatly improved. Thanks to the strengthening of on-site management, the Xieji No. 2 Mine has achieved excellent results in various indicators this year. From January to September this year, the mine's coal output exceeded the plan by more than 1,900 tons; the full-attendance efficiency increased by 11.3% compared to the plan; the ash content of the coal decreased by 4% compared to the plan; the consumption of timber per thousand tons decreased by 1.91 cubic meters compared to the plan, saving a total of 2,767 cubic meters of timber. From January to September this year, the average monthly output of each coal mining face reached more than 13,000 tons, exceeding the standard of a "ten-thousand-ton mine" stipulated by the Ministry of Coal Industry. Among them, September reached the standard of a "high-yield mine." In early October, the mine also overfulfilled the ten-day plan by 14%, and the average daily output increased by more than 12% compared to early September.

    This mine began to rely on the masses to strengthen on-site production management in February this year. Now, all coal mining, tunneling, and electromechanical transportation basic units in this mine have fully implemented this system. Their specific approach is: workers democratically elect various non-detached workers as business administrators in each production team, who participate in labor while being responsible for various on-site production management tasks. For example, each coal mining team has ten administrators, namely, a planning statistician, personnel attendance clerk, tool administrator, timber administrator, safety inspector, technical innovation worker, coal-loss administrator, material administrator, cost supervisor, and project acceptance inspector. At the same time, each production team has also established a democratic management committee, with the brigade leader as the chairman, the three shift leaders as the vice-chairmen, and the leaders of the "ten administrators" as members, to jointly study and solve various problems found in on-site production. In order to give full play to the role of worker administrators, they also use methods such as in-pit classes and on-site guidance to clarify the scope of work of various administrators and help them improve their business management level. And the tasks of various business administrators are compiled into concise and easy-to-remember slogans. For example, the task of the project acceptance inspector is: "Unqualified, no acceptance, meeting specifications is required, for the country, for comrades, more or less acceptance is not allowed, strictly implement the acceptance system, this is how to fulfill your duty."

    Before workers were mobilized to participate in management, the on-site production management work of this mine was mainly done by the district and team leaders. The tasks and indicators of many business departments in the mine were all placed on the shoulders of the district and team leaders. "Thousands of threads from above, one needle below," this is the main crux of the weak on-site production management. Liu Decai, the captain of the coal mining team three, said: "At that time, all the work was placed on me alone. I worked more than ten hours a day, but there were still a lot of problems." The workers believed that management was the captain's business, and they would go to the captain for anything and do whatever the captain told them to do. Because of the heavy workload and numerous matters, the captain often took care of one thing and lost sight of another, resulting in no one being responsible for on-site management and a chaotic production order. For example, the project specifications were not good, and accidents often occurred; various mechanical equipment was poorly managed and broke down in a few days; timber was thrown around everywhere, and waste was very serious; some coal mining teams lost their shovels after only a few days of use. Because there were many accidents and serious waste, the normal production was seriously affected, and the various production indicators could not be quickly improved.

    Since the implementation of worker participation in management, the face of on-site production management has greatly changed. Now, the various management tasks of the production team leader are largely contracted out by the worker administrators, so that everything is managed by someone, eliminating the chaos caused by no one being responsible for on-site management. At the same time, it further improved the workers' sense of responsibility as masters and gave full play to the enthusiasm of the workers. For example, the planning statistician goes to the mine early every shift to listen to reports, prepare the shift's work plan, and can propose measures to overcome various difficulties in production. The project acceptance inspector immediately marks the projects that do not meet the specifications and asks the workers to repair them. The tool administrator not only manages the tools well, but also repairs and reuses the old tools in a timely manner. The material administrator does not allow a single nail for nailing bamboo mats to be lost, and does not allow any material to be wasted in vain. Tool administrator Che Jiapu once went up the well, and found that a shovel was missing in his shift, so he immediately went down the well and found it back. Many workers are afraid of losing and damaging tools, so they take the tools home to keep them after work. Tool administrator Xie Guangming repaired and reused 312 old shovels by himself. After the issuance and use of timber were handed over to the workers for management, they overcame waste in various ways, so that the recovery rate and reuse rate of timber were greatly improved. The workers said: "How can you know the cost of firewood and rice if you are not in charge of the household." As a result, the mine not only reversed the situation of overspending timber in the second quarter, but also saved more than 1,750 cubic meters of timber. After the workers participated in management, they happily said: "Manage the work yourself, know the past and the future, and think about tomorrow." Some workers said: "In the past, one person carried a thousand pounds, now everyone does everything."

    While mobilizing workers to participate in management, the mine also further strengthened professional management, achieving a combination of professional management and mass management. In the past, because the captain managed too much and could not take care of everything, although many meetings were held, various business indicators were still difficult to implement. Now, with various business administrators, they can carry out work through various business administrators, so that the completion of various business indicators has a reliable foundation. After the on-site management work was shared by various worker business administrators, the burden on the district and team leaders was reduced. They can now spend 50% of their time participating in labor, discovering and solving problems in a timely manner, and focusing on inspection, supervision, and assisting various administrators in managing various businesses. Many district and team leaders happily said: "In the past, the brain was like a basin of paste (meaning confused), now the brain is really clear." Moreover, because the cadres participate in labor production as role models, it greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the workers. When they saw the district and team leaders working hard, they became more motivated. At the same time, it further strengthened the relationship between cadres and workers. For example, Liu Jingfu, the duty section chief of the coal mining section one, was very enthusiastic in the past, but because the task was arranged urgently and the attitude was blunt, the workers were unwilling to approach him. Now, because he participates in labor with the workers and jointly studies and solves problems, the workers are willing to approach him, and tell him everything on their mind.

    On the basis of fully mobilizing workers to participate in management, the mine also reviewed various rules and regulations, abolished some outdated old rules and regulations, and established some new rules and regulations to promote production development. At the same time, according to the characteristics of multi-cycle operations, the procedures were arranged reasonably and carefully, and the labor organization was balanced. For example, the past one-shift coal mining was changed to two-shift coal mining, and the past three-shift pillar recovery was changed to one-shift pillar recovery, and cross-operations and parallel operations were implemented, so that working hours were fully utilized. They also established various responsibility systems and reward systems, which played a great role in promoting mass participation in management and ensuring the completion of production tasks.

    依靠群众搞好现场管理
    本报记者　汤天真
    淮南煤矿谢家集二矿依靠群众加强生产现场管理，充分发挥了职工群众的积极性，提高了企业的管理水平，保证了生产任务全面均衡超额地完成。
    现场管理，是整个企业生产管理的基础。基层生产单位管理好了，整个企业的管理水平和生产水平随之大大提高。谢家集二矿由于加强了现场管理工作，今年以来各项指标完成的都很好。今年
  1至9月份，这个矿的煤炭产量超过计划一千九百多吨，全员效率，比计划提高11.3％；煤的含灰率，比计划降低4％；坑木千吨耗比计划降低一点九一立方米，共节约坑木二
  千七百六十七立方米。今年1至9月份，每个采煤工作面的平均月产量达到一万三千多吨，超过了煤炭部规定的“万吨矿”的标准，其中9月份还达到了“高额丰产矿”的标准。10月上旬，又超额14％完成了旬计划，平均日产量比9月上旬提高了12％以上。
    这个矿依靠群众加强生产现场管理是今年2月间开始进行的。现在，这个矿所有的采煤、掘进队和机电运输的基层单位，都全面实行了这一制度。他们的具体做法是：由工人民主推选，在每个生产队里设立各种不脱产的工人业务管理员，一面参加劳动，一面负责现场的各项生产管理工作。如在每个采煤队里就设有十大员，即计划统计员、人事考勤员、工具管理员、坑木管理员、安全检查员、技术革新员、遗煤管理员、材料管理员、成本监督员和工程验收员。同时，各个生产队还成立了民主管理委员会，以大队长为主任委员，三班队长为副主任委员，“十大员”组长为委员，共同研究解决现场生产中发现的各种问题。为了充分发挥工人管理员的作用，他们还采用井口上课和现场辅导的办法，明确各种管理员的业务范围，帮助他们提高业务管理水平。并且把各种业务管理员的任务编成简明易记的口号。如工程验收员的任务是：“不合格，不验收，合乎规格是要求，为国家，为同志，多收少收都不是，严格执行验收制，这样才算尽了职”。
    在没有发动工人参加管理以前，这个矿的现场生产管理工作主要是区、队长几个人做。矿里许多业务科室的任务和指标，都压在区、队长的身上。“上面千条线，下面一根针”，这是现场生产管理薄弱的主要症结所在。该矿采煤三队队长刘德才说：“那时，一切工作都放在我一个人身上，一天工作十几个小时，问题还是一大堆。”而工人则认为管理工作是队长的事情，有什么事都找队长，队长叫干什么就干什么。由于任务重，头多，队长常常顾此失彼，形成现场管理无人负责，生产秩序混乱。如工程规格不好，经常出事故；各种机械设备管理不善，用不几天就坏了；坑木到处乱丢，浪费现象很严重，有的采煤队领的铲子，没用几天就丢了。由于事故多，浪费现象严重，严重影响了生产的正常进行，各项生产指标不能很快的提高。
    自实行工人参加管理以后，大大改变了生产现场管理工作的面貌。原来生产队长的各种管理工作，现在大部由工人管理员分工包干，做到了事事都有人管，消灭了现场管理无人负责而造成的各种混乱现象。同时，进一步提高了工人主人翁的责任感，充分发挥了职工群众的积极性。如计划统计员每班都提前到矿听取汇报，编制当班的作业计划，并能针对生产上的各种困难，提出克服困难的措施。工程验收员发现工程不合规格时，立即打上记号交工人重新修理。工具管理员不但管好工具，而且将破旧工具及时进行修理复用。材料管理员连钉竹笆的一根洋钉都不肯丢失，不让一点材料白白的浪费。工具管理员车家普，有一次已经上井了，发现本班少了一把铲子，立刻又下井找了回来。许多工人怕工具丢失和损坏，下班时都把工具自己带回家去保存，工具管理员谢光明一人，就将三百一十二把破旧铲子修理复用。坑木领发使用交给工人管理后，他们便从各方面克服浪费现象，使坑木的回收率和复用率大大提高。工人们说：“不当家那里知道柴米贵”。结果，全矿第二季度不仅扭转了坑木超支的局面，而且还节约了一千七百五十多立方米坑木。工人参加管理后，都高兴地说：“自己干活自己管，知前知后想明天”。有的工人说：“过去是千斤重担一人担，现在是千事万事大家办”。
    在发动工人参加管理的同时，这个矿还进一步加强了专业管理，做到了专业管理和群众性的管理相结合；原来由于队长管的太多，照顾不过来，尽管开了不少的会议，而各种业务指标还是很难落实。现在，有了各种业务管理员后，他们就能通过各种业务管理员进行工作，使各项业务指标的完成有了可靠的基础。现场管理工作由各种工人业务管理员分担后，减少了区、队长的负担，他们每天就可以抽出50％的时间参加劳动，及时发现和解决问题，并做到了重点检查、督促和协助各管理员管好各项业务。许多区、队长都高兴地说：“过去脑子像盆浆（意思是糊里糊涂的），现在脑子真清爽”。而且，由于干部以身作则地参加劳动生产，大大激发了工人的积极性，他们看到区、队长干得汗流浃背，自己的干劲就更大了。同时，也进一步密切了干部和工人的关系。如采煤一区值班区长刘景付同志过去虽然积极性很高，但由于任务布置急，态度生硬，工人都不愿接近他；现在由于和工人一起参加劳动，共同研究解决问题，工人都愿意接近他了，有啥知心话都对他说。
    在充分发动工人参加管理的基础上，这个矿又对各种规章制度进行了审查，废除了一些过时的陈规旧章，建立了一些新的促进生产发展的规章制度。同时，根据多循环作业的特点，合理仔细的安排了工序，平衡了劳动组织。如把过去一班采煤改为两班采煤，将过去三班回柱改为一班回柱，实行交叉作业和平行作业，做到了充分利用工时。他们还建立了各种责任制度和奖励制度，对推动群众参加管理和保证生产任务的完成起了很大的作用。
