    "Dongfanghong" Exits the Workshop
    Bing Zhu
    The assembly line, three meters wide,
    Flat steel plates on both sides;
    Two long chains suspended in between,
    A long bridge, truly a beautiful scene.
    Tractors arrive on top,
    Moving forward without a stop;
    Into the paint room for a makeover,
    Emerging, dressed in red all over.
    The driver jumps on the vehicle,
    Hands gripping the controls with zeal;
    "Dongfanghong" exits the workshop with pride,
    Illuminating the entire sky, crimson-dyed.

    “东方红”出车间
    冰竹装配带，三米宽，平直的钢板铺两边；两条长链中间悬，一座长桥真美观。拖拉机到上面，一刻不停向前赶；喷漆室里去化妆，出来穿上红衣衫。驾驶员，跳上车，双手紧握操纵杆；“东方红”出车间，照得满天红艳艳。
