    Jib Crane is Highly Efficient
    (Our report) Fushun Railway Station workers have vigorously engaged in tool innovation, creating a fifteen-meter-high tower jib crane. This jib crane requires neither electricity nor oil, and can lift eight tons of cargo at a time. Loading and unloading large iron plates is twenty times more efficient than using manpower in the past. (Attached picture)
    Workers at the Luzhou Port Wharf have built nineteen various types of lifting equipment, such as umbrella-style, double-boom, and four-wheeled cranes, which have replaced a lot of heavy manual labor for loading and unloading. This is a 1.5-ton four-wheeled crane loading a car.

    摇臂吊效率高
    本报讯　抚顺车站职工大搞工具革新，创造了一台十五米高的塔式摇臂吊。这种摇臂吊一不用电，二不用油，一次能吊八吨重的货物，装卸大铁板比过去用人力提高效率二十倍以上。（附图片）
    泸州市港口码头工人自造伞式、双杆式、四轮起重吊车等各式起重设备十九台，代替了很多工人用体力装卸的繁重劳动。这是一吨半的四轮起重吊车正在装吊汽车。
