Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 16th: A heavy snow has fallen, and the land in Heilongjiang Province is already frozen. Thanks to giving full play to the power of the people's communes and agricultural machinery, the province has plowed more than 44 million mu of land (accounting for 41.9% of the total cultivated land) before the freeze-up, victoriously completing the autumn plowing task. According to inspections in various places, the quality of this year's plowing exceeds any previous year. Generally, the land has been plowed to a depth of five to six inches or more depending on the soil layer. More than six inches deep accounts for 81.2% of the autumn plowing area, and it has been done with plowing, harrowing, and compacting simultaneously. Some places have also applied fertilizer after plowing, basically meeting the quality requirements before sowing.

The autumn plowing in Heilongjiang Province was carried out simultaneously with the intense autumn harvest work. At that time, there was a lot of work, heavy tasks, and a large amount of labor required. During the harvesting period, animal power was surplus, but during the pulling and threshing period, labor and animal power were strained. Before the communization, this would have formed a contradiction of "争嘴" ("arguing") between the autumn harvest and autumn plowing in terms of labor and animal power. However, because the people's communes were realized, this contradiction was smoothly resolved. The people's communes in various places, based on the characteristics of busy people and idle horses in the harvesting stage, organized various professional production teams. At the same time, based on the principle of equivalent exchange, they carried out large-scale cooperation, ensuring that the autumn harvest and autumn plowing went hand in hand. In Hulan, Zhaodong, and other counties, each commune, due to the organization of more than 1,000 professional teams (groups) for cutting, pulling, threshing, and plowing, not only finished the harvesting ahead of schedule but also completed the tasks of plowing, pulling, and delivering grain simultaneously on November 8th.

Fully utilizing agricultural machinery, new-style animal-powered farm implements, and improved farm implements is another important factor ensuring that Heilongjiang Province's autumn plowing is fast and good. During the autumn plowing, the province mobilized 1,300 tractors and 115,000 various animal-powered plows. At the same time, old-fashioned farm implements were also widely reformed. In this way, not only is the plowing efficiency high, but the quality is also good, generally reaching five or six inches deep.

At present, because the land is frozen in various parts of Heilongjiang Province, plowing has stopped in most areas. However, some areas are taking advantage of the short time of daytime thawing to carry out emergency sowing and land preparation, striving to plow and harrow more, in order to prepare for the continued leap forward in agriculture next year.

### 发挥人民公社和农业机械的威力  黑龙江在封冻前完成翻地计划

    发挥人民公社和农业机械的威力
    黑龙江在封冻前完成翻地计划
    新华社哈尔滨16日电　一场大雪飘过，黑龙江省大地已经封冻。由于充分发挥了人民公社和农业机械的威力，在结冻以前，全省已经翻耕土地四千四百多万亩（占总耕地面积41.9％），胜利地完成了秋翻任务。据各地检查，今年翻地质量超过历史上任何一年，一般的都根据土层情况翻到五寸至六寸以上，六寸以上的占秋翻面积81.2％，并且做到随翻、随耙、随镇压，还有些地方翻后施了肥料，基本上达到了播种前的质量要求。
    黑龙江省的秋翻地是和紧张的秋收工作同时进行的。当时，活计多、任务重、用工量也大，收割期畜力有余，而拉打期劳畜力紧张。这在公社化前就要形成秋收和秋翻在劳畜力上“争嘴”的矛盾。可是因为实现了人民公社化，这个矛盾顺利地解决了。各地人民公社，根据收割阶段人忙马闲的特点，组织了各种不同的生产专业队，同时，根据等价交换的原则，开展大协作，做到了秋收和秋翻地齐头并进。呼兰、肇东等县各公社，由于组织了割、拉、打、翻地的专业队（组）一千多人，不仅提前结束了收割，而且在11月8日同时完成了翻地、拉地、送粮任务。
    充分发挥农业机器、新式畜力农具和改良农具的作用，是黑龙江省保证秋翻又快又好的另一重要因素。秋翻时，全省出动了一千三百台拖拉机和十一万五千台各种畜力翻地犁，同时，还广泛地改革了旧式农具。这样，不仅翻地的效率高，而且质量也好，一般都达到五、六寸深。
    目前，黑龙江省各地因为大地封冻，大部分地区已经停犁，但部分地区尚乘白天化冻的短暂时间，进行抢播和整地工作，争取多翻多耙一些，为明年农业继续跃进作好准备。
