    Chinese Style
    Li Chun
    In the bridge construction team there's old man Wang,
    His age has passed seventy-three,
    He sets bridge piers above the white clouds,
    His silver beard flutters on his bronze chest,
    He has a young heart,
    And a hero's courage.
    The old stonemason's skill is exquisite,
    His craftsmanship extraordinary,
    He carves dragons that will fly,
    Sculpts lions that can roar,
    Having held a stone drill for half a century,
    His face is etched with wrinkles,
    His heart engraved with bitterness.
    Ever since the Red Army passed his hometown,
    The Party gave him boundless strength,
    He wielded his stone axe and drill to kill White bandits,
    He climbed mountain peaks to carve slogans,
    The "Long Live the Red Army" on that steep cliff,
    Made the enemy tremble with fear…
    Now he has plunged into the torrent of socialist construction,
    He uses the stone drill that carved endless pain and bitterness,
    To carve the pride and joy of the Chinese people on the bridge piers.
    Look, the old stonemason stands on the bridge pier,
    His silver beard flutters on his bronze chest,
    The morning glow sets off his radiant face.
    Ah, such venerable old men,
    I have seen hundreds and thousands,
    Are Ganoderma lucidum of communism,
    Transforming them into youth,
    —This is the Chinese style,
    Because China is an eternal spring!

    中国风格
    黎春
    桥工队里有个王老汉，
    年纪已过七十三，
    白云上把桥墩安，
    银须飘拂在古铜色的胸前，
    他有一颗年轻的心，
    还有一副英雄的胆。
    老石匠的技术精巧，
    手艺非凡，
    凿龙龙会飞，
    雕狮狮能吼，
    拿了半世纪的石钻，
    在脸上刻满了皱纹，
    在心上刻满了辛酸。
    自从红军过家乡，
    党给了他无穷尽的力量，
    杀白匪他舞起了石斧石钻，
    刻标语他攀上了山巅，
    那陡峭崖壁上的“红军万岁”，
    使敌人心惊胆颤……。
    如今他又投入了建设社会主义的洪流，
    他用他刻过无限痛楚与辛酸的石钻，
    在桥墩上刻下了中国人的骄傲与欢欣。
    看，老石匠站在桥墩上，
    银须飘拂在古铜色的胸前，
    朝霞衬着他满面红光。
    啊，这样可敬的老人，
    我见过成百上千，
    是共产主义的灵芝草，
    把他们变成青年，
    ——这就是中国的风格，
    因为中国是永恒的春天！
