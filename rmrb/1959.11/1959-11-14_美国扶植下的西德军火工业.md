The West German Arms Industry Under US Support
Qian Long

Thanks to the joint efforts of the Soviet Union and peace-loving people around the world, the recent international situation continues to trend towards relaxation. The Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament has been positively received by world public opinion. Reducing armaments to further ease the international situation has become a common and powerful call of the people of all countries. However, West German government leaders are still clamoring for "increasing defense efforts" before concluding a comprehensive disarmament agreement. Recently, West Germany has not only purchased a large number of military aircraft and missiles from the United States and France, equipped its first atomic missile battalion, and intensified the establishment of combat troops for the navy and air force, but also, with the help and direct investment of US monopoly capital, is stepping up arms production, especially atomic weapons and missile production. They attempt to block the path of disarmament and continue to maintain international tensions.

I

After regaining its economic strength, ambitious West German militarism has been attempting to rebuild its military power. The Paris Agreement came into effect in 1955, and West Germany joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) aggressive bloc, openly establishing its army. This paved the way for West Germany's militarization. In March 1958, after the Federal Parliament passed a resolution to equip the Federal Defense Force with atomic weapons, West Germany embarked on the path of atomic armament. On October 22 of this year, under the instruction of Norstad, the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group Army, the council of the "Western European Union," which includes seven countries—Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg—openly revoked the ban restricting West Germany's production of missile weapons and allowed West Germany, along with France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Italy, to manufacture the American "Hawk" surface-to-air missiles and "Sidewinder" air-to-air missiles. At the same time, according to Deutsche Presse-Agentur reports, the Western European Union is also considering the West German government's request to relax the restriction prohibiting West Germany from owning warships of more than 3,000 tons. These measures by the Western European Union condone West Germany's ambition to mass-produce modern killing weapons.

The current development of the West German economy has prepared the conditions for arms production. Therefore, since last year, West German Defense Minister Strauss has been clamoring for arms "self-sufficiency." In the past few years, most of West Germany's military orders were placed abroad. From the fiscal year 1953-1954 to 1956-1957, West Germany placed only 3.2 billion marks of military orders domestically, while orders placed abroad reached 5 billion marks. In the fiscal year 1957-1958, domestic orders were 2.6 billion marks, while foreign orders decreased to 700 million marks. Currently, domestic military orders account for 60% of the West German government's total military orders. This shows that West Germany's arms industry is undergoing rapid expansion according to the established policy of Strauss and his ilk.

The purpose of West German arms production is by no means limited to "self-sufficiency," but also to strengthen West Germany's political position in the Atlantic group. Strauss once bluntly said that having the ability to produce arms is necessary for Bonn to have a greater say in the affairs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In fact, West Germany, which first attempted to dominate Western Europe, has already gained an important position within the Atlantic group due to its economic strength and US support. Therefore, West German monopoly capital believes that without a strong military force, it is impossible to compete with Britain for a dominant position within the North Atlantic group. Not long ago, Atlantic group countries such as Turkey and Greece had already expressed that they would be willing to purchase West German arms if West Germany could become a major supplier of arms for the Atlantic group countries, which further prompted West Germany's urgent need to develop its arms industry. At the same time, the policy of arms "self-sufficiency" also reflects the West German monopolists' pursuit of high profits. The West German Trade Union Federation's organ, "Arbeitswelt" (Labor World), wrote in its editorial on May 6 of this year: "Military orders are often businesses worth billions of marks, with no price competition, and are safe and worthwhile businesses. Huge profits can be made from these orders." From the current economic situation in West Germany, the rapid economic growth of the past few years has ended. Since the end of 1957, the growth rate of the West German economy has slowed down. Since that time, some industrial sectors, such as the coal mining industry, the steel industry, and the shipbuilding industry, have experienced stagnation, decline, and crises of overcapacity. With the general deterioration of the capitalist world economy and sharp trade competition, the West German economic situation is deteriorating. In order to find a way out of the crisis, since last year, West German monopoly capital has been attempting to open a path through military production. In early 1958, the chairman of the Federation of West German Industries wrote to the West German Minister of Defense, requesting that more military orders be left to domestic enterprises. At the end of 1958, the West German automobile industry had already accepted 1 billion marks of military orders, the aircraft industry accepted 1.2 billion marks of orders, and the shipbuilding industry received even more, with 3 billion marks of orders. The increase in these military orders is one of the important reasons why West German industrial production in the first half of this year increased slightly compared to the same period last year.

II

Under the guidance of the policy of arms "self-sufficiency," West German arms production has made great progress.

In terms of aircraft manufacturing: According to "Bundeswehr-Korrespondenz" (Federal Defense Force Correspondence), by December 1958, West German companies had manufactured 940 military aircraft. According to a recent report by Deutsche-Korrespondenz, the four companies "Heinkel," "Messerschmitt," "Dornier," and "Siebel," which actively participated in the establishment of Hitler's German Air Force, began producing the American "Starfighter" fighter jet and the Italian "Fiat G.91" aircraft in October of this year. The two companies "Weser" and "Focke-Wulf" have also begun manufacturing aircraft for the Federal Defense Force. West German aircraft manufacturing factories will manufacture 200 "Starfighter" fighter jets and 150 "Fiat G.91" aircraft. Siemens enterprises are also producing military aircraft equipment orders.

In terms of military vehicle production: The factories of "Klöckner," "Henschel," "Hanomag," and other companies will produce 6,000 half-track armored vehicles for the Bundeswehr. Relevant West German companies are preparing to participate in the completion of heavy tank orders.

In terms of military shipbuilding: West Germany has manufactured several midget submarines this year. The Kiel shipyard is building twelve submarines for the navy. Recently, the West German Ministry of Defense prepared to purchase 144 different types of landing craft from the United States, of which 24 will be purchased from the United States, and the others will be imitated by West German shipyards. In recent years, West Germany will build twelve destroyers, six escort ships, and prepare to manufacture battleships.

In terms of atomic weapons and rocket weapons production: The Krupp concern, which has made a comeback, the Siemens concern, General Electric, German Machine Manufacturing Co., Flick factories, and a series of other companies have participated in the production of atomic weapons and rocket weapons. About 30 concerns have joined a joint organization "Physical Science Research Association" to prepare for the manufacture of atomic weapons. West Germany is also preparing to build an atomic weapons factory in North Rhine-Westphalia. In 1960, West Germany will produce the American "Hawk" missile.

West Germany's expansion of arms production is not being carried out alone. In order to make West Germany a tool for implementing its aggressive policies in Europe, the United States has long been striving to support West Germany's arms industry. And now, when West Germany is vigorously developing its domestic arms industry, the United States, in order to reap huge profits in this place where costs and wages are lower than in the United States, is also intensifying its collusion with West German monopoly capital and is striving to intervene in the West German arms industry. According to recent foreign press reports, the largest US arms companies have begun to pour billions of US dollars of investment and provide abundant technical data to the emerging West German arms industry. According to the "New York Times," the motivation behind this action is that West Germany "will certainly become an important arms-producing country in the future." Therefore, there are reports that the US monopoly group has decided to invest US$1 billion in West German arms companies in the next six or seven years. US monopoly capital is particularly keen on investments in aircraft, missiles, and tanks. Now, Lockheed is buying shares in Heinkel and Messerschmitt, and General Electric has purchased a large number of shares in the Bavarian Engine Factory, which will produce engines for the F-104 aircraft. American Motors is also buying its shares, cooperating with it to manufacture vehicles for the West German army. American Aircraft has purchased shares in Weser Shipyard. Perkin-Elmer, which manufactures the "Sidewinder" missile, has established a branch to manufacture the "Sidewinder" missile "improved" by German engineers. American Continental Motors has reached an agreement with Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz to jointly manufacture tank power equipment. American Studebaker-Packard has joined forces with Daimler-Benz to jointly trial-produce ramjet missiles and tank engines. Bell Aircraft has also purchased a large number of West German shares. The collusion between US monopoly capital groups and West German monopoly capital groups will accelerate the revival of West German militarism.

In terms of atomic weapons production, Western countries have also carried out close cooperation with West Germany. After West German Defense Minister Strauss visited the United States this year, he signed an "Atomic Agreement" with the United States, stipulating that the two countries would exchange "nuclear military intelligence." In January 1958, West Germany, France, and Italy formed the so-called "Military Triangle" and signed a secret protocol for research and manufacture of rockets. At the end of March last year, West Germany and France signed a secret treaty to cooperate in the manufacture of rocket weapons and atomic weapons. West Germany actively participated in France's plan to test atomic bombs in the Sahara. The active support and full cooperation of Western countries in West German arms production has further fueled the arrogance of West German militarist expansion.

III

This conspiracy of West Germany and US monopoly capital to actively revive the West German arms industry explains why the Adenauer government is afraid of the relaxation of international tensions and afraid of comprehensive disarmament. From here, people can also clearly see what the purpose of Adenauer's stubbornly delaying and opposing the convening of a summit meeting between the East and the West is. However, the fact that West Germany and US monopoly capital are currently intensifying the expansion of arms production in an attempt to undermine the already easing international situation has not only met with strong opposition from the people of West Germany and peace-loving people around the world, but even some Western countries are uneasy because "the rapid growth of the West German arms industry appears at a time when the prospects for securing a global disarmament treaty are the brightest." Facts prove that the will of the people of the world to demand peace and to ease international tensions is unstoppable. Adenauer's stubborn opposition to East-West consultations to resolve international issues has in fact isolated him both domestically and internationally. With the development of the situation, the West German government's policy of arms expansion and war preparation will encounter increasing difficulties.

    美国扶植下的西德军火工业
    乾龙
    在苏联和各国爱好和平人民的共同努力下，最近国际局势继续趋向和缓。苏联的全面、彻底的裁军建议，得到了世界公众的积极反应。裁减军备以导致国际局势的进一步和缓，已经成为各国人民共同的强大呼声。可是，西德的政府领导人仍然大肆叫嚷，要求在缔结一项全面裁军协定以前“增加防御方面的努力”。最近西德不仅大量购买美国和法国的军用飞机和导弹，装备起第一个原子导弹营，加紧建立海空军的战斗部队，而且在美国垄断资本的帮助和直接投资下，正在加紧军火生产，特别是原子武器和导弹生产。它们妄图以此堵塞裁军的道路，继续保持国际紧张局势。
    一
    野心勃勃的西德军国主义在恢复了它的经济力量之后，就一直企图重建它的军事势力。1955年巴黎协定生效，西德参加了北大西洋公约侵略集团，公开建立军队。这就为西德的军国主义化铺平了道路。1958年3月，联邦议院通过用原子武器装备联邦国防军的决议以后，西德更走上了原子武装的道路。今年10月22日，在北大西洋集团军总司令诺斯塔德授意下，包括英、法、西德、意、荷、比、卢七国的“西欧联盟”的理事会更通过决议，公然撤销限制西德生产导弹武器的禁令，并准许西德和法、荷、比、意四国一道制造美国的“鹰式”地对空导弹和“响尾蛇式”空对空导弹。同时，据德意志新闻社报道，西欧联盟还在考虑西德政府提出的要求放宽不准西德拥有三千吨以上军舰的限制。西欧联盟的这些措施，纵容了西德大规模制造现代化杀人武器的野心。
    目前西德经济的发展，为军火生产准备了条件。因此，从去年起，西德国防部长施特劳斯便大声叫嚷军火“自给自足”。在过去几年里，西德军事订货大部分是向国外订购的。从1953—1954年度到1956年—1957年度，西德向国内军事订货只三十二亿马克，而向国外订货达五十亿马克。1957—1958年度国内订货为二十六亿马克，而国外订货则降低为七亿马克。目前军事订货中，国内军事订货已占西德政府军事订货总额的60％。这就可以看出，西德的军火工业正在按照施特劳斯之流的已定方针进行急剧扩张。
    西德军火生产的目的决不仅限于“自给自足”，而且是为了加强西德在大西洋集团中的政治地位。施特劳斯曾经露骨地说，要使波恩在北大西洋公约组织的事务中有较大的发言权，拥有军火生产能力是必要的。事实上，首先企图称霸西欧的西德，已经由于它的经济实力和美国的支持，在大西洋集团内取得了重要的地位。因此西德垄断资本认为，要在北大西洋集团内同英国争夺优势地位，没有强大的军事力量是不行的。而不久以前，大西洋集团国家，如土耳其、希腊就已经表示，如果西德能成为大西洋集团国家的军火主要供应国，它们将愿意购买西德军火，这就更促使西德亟需发展军火工业。同时，军火“自给自足”的方针也正体现了西德垄断资本家追求高额利润的要求。西德工会联合会机关报“劳动世界报”今年5月6日的社论写道：“军事订货往往是价值数十亿马克的生意，又没有价格上的竞争，是保险的值得做的生意。从这些订货中可以捞到大笔利润”。从西德目前经济情况来看，前几年经济快速度发展已经结束。自1957年年底开始，西德经济增长速度已经减慢。从那个时候以来，有些工业部门如煤矿工业、钢铁工业、造船工业等都出现了生产停滞、下降和过剩的危机。随着资本主义世界经济情况的普遍恶化以及尖锐的贸易竞争，西德经济情况正在每况愈下。为了从危机中找寻出路，自去年开始，西德的垄断资本就企图从军事生产方面来打开一条出路。1958年初，西德工业家联合会主席写信给西德国防部长，要求把军事订货更多地留给国内企业。在1958年年底，西德汽车工业已接受了十亿马克的军事订货，飞机工业接受了十二亿马克的订货，而造船工业更获得了三十亿马克的订货。今年上半年西德工业生产所以比去年同期稍有增长，这种军事订货的增长是重要原因之一。
    二
    在军火“自给自足”的方针指导下，西德的军火生产已经有了很大的发展。
    在飞机制造方面：据“国防军通讯”报道，到1958年12月，西德公司已经制造了九百四十架军用飞机。据最近德意志通讯社报道，曾积极参加建立希特勒德国空军的“亨克尔”、“梅塞施米特”、“道尼尔”和“西贝尔”四家公司已于今年10月开始生产美国的“星式”战斗机和意大利“菲亚特91型”飞机，“威悉尔”和“福克—符夫”两家公司也已开始为联邦国防军制造飞机。西德的飞机制造工厂将要制造二百架“星式”战斗机和一百五十架“菲亚特91型”飞机。西门子康采恩的企业也正在生产军用飞机设备的订货。
    在军用车辆生产方面：“克勒克内”、“汉舍尔”、“哈努马克”等公司的工厂将为国防军生产出六千辆半履带式装甲车。西德有关公司正准备参与完成重坦克的订货。
    在军用舰艇制造方面：西德今年已制造了几艘袖珍潜水艇。基尔造船厂正在为海军建造十二艘潜水艇。最近，西德国防部准备向美国购买一百四十四艘不同类型的登陆艇，其中除二十四艘要向美国购买外，其它由西德造船厂仿造。在最近几年中，西德将建成十二艘驱逐舰、六艘护航舰，并准备制造主力舰。
    在原子武器和火箭武器生产方面：卷土重来的克虏伯康采恩、西门子康采恩、通用电气公司、德国机器制造有限公司、弗利克工厂和一系列其它公司都参加了原子武器和火箭武器的生产。约有三十个康采恩参加了一个准备制造原子武器的企业联合组织“物理科学研究协会”。西德并准备在北莱茵—威斯特伐利亚州建设原子武器工厂。1960年西德将生产美国的“鹰式”导弹。
    西德扩大军火生产不是单独进行的。美国为了使西德成为它在欧洲执行侵略政策的工具，早就在竭力扶植西德的军火工业。而目前当西德国内大力发展军火工业时，美国为了在这个成本和工资比美国低廉的地方捞取厚利，也加紧和西德垄断资本勾结一起，竭力插手于西德的军火工业。据最近外国报刊报道，美国最大的那些军火公司已开始向西德新兴的军火工业倾注亿万美元的投资和提供丰富的技术资料。据美国“纽约时报”报道，这种行动后面的动机是，认为西德将来“一定会成为一个重要的军火生产的国家”。因此，有消息说，美国垄断集团决定在今后六、七年内在西德军火企业中投放十亿美元的资本。美国垄断资本特别热衷于飞机、导弹和坦克等方面的投资。现在美国洛克希德公司正在购买亨克尔和梅塞施米特公司的股票，美国通用电气公司购买了巴伐利亚发动机工厂的大量股份，这个工厂将生产F—104式飞机的引擎。美国汽车公司也正在购买它的股票，同它合作为西德陆军制造车辆。美国飞机公司已经购买了威悉尔造船公司的股票。美国制造“响尾蛇式”导弹的帕尔金—艾尔莫公司已经建立了一个分公司来制造经德国工程师“改进”了的“响尾蛇式”导弹。美国大陆汽车公司已经同克勒克内—洪堡—多伊茨公司取得协议，合制坦克动力设备。美国史蒂倍克—派克汽车公司已和戴姆勒—本茨汽车公司联合，共同试制活塞喷气导弹和坦克引擎。美国贝尔飞机公司也购买了西德大量股票。美国垄断资本集团与西德垄断资本集团勾结一起，这将使西德军国主义更快地复活起来。
    在原子武器生产方面，西方国家也和西德进行了密切的合作。今年西德国防部长施特劳斯访美后，和美国签订了一个“原子协定”，规定两国交换“核军事情报”。1958年1月，西德和法、意组成了所谓“军事三角”，签订了研究和制造火箭的秘密议定书。去年3月底，西德和法国又签订秘密条约，准备合作制造火箭武器和原子武器。西德积极参加了法国在撒哈拉试验原子弹的计划。西方国家对西德军火生产的积极扶植和通力协作，更加助长了西德军国主义扩张的气焰。
    三
    西德和美国的垄断资本这种积极复活西德军火工业的阴谋，说明了为什么阿登纳政府害怕国际紧张局势走向缓和，害怕全面裁军的原因。从这里人们也可以清楚地看出，阿登纳顽固地拖延和反对召开东西方最高级会议的目的是什么。但是，西德和美国垄断资本目前加紧扩大军火生产，企图破坏已经出现缓和的国际局势，这不仅遭到西德和全世界爱好和平人民的强烈反对，甚至某些西方国家也因为“西德军火工业的迅速增长出现在争取订立世界性裁军条约的前景最为光明的时候”，而感到不安。事实证明，世界人民要求和平、要求缓和国际紧张局势的意志是不可阻挡的。阿登纳顽固地反对东西方协商解决国际问题的态度，实际上已经使他在国内外处于孤立的境地。随着形势的发展，西德政府的扩军备战政策将会遭到越来越大的困难。
