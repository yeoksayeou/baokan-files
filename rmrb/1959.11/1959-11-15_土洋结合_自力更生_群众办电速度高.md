More Electricity Generation, More Electricity Supply, Supporting the Great Leap Forward in Industry and Agriculture
—Experience Exchange Meeting of the National Hero Conference on Water Conservancy and Electricity Systems

    Last year, driven by the excellent situation of mass-run electricity and the all-round Great Leap Forward with steel as the key link, the construction of the Longfeng Hydropower Station in Suining County, Sichuan Province, began. The Longfeng Hydropower Station is a comprehensive water conservancy project for power generation, irrigation, and shipping. The infrastructure tasks of the project include a power station with an installed capacity of 8,800 kilowatts and a 27-kilometer-long water diversion canal, with a total of 106 buildings.

    This is a medium-sized water conservancy project. However, it was built by the commune relying on self-reliance, under the guidance of the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods. At present, one generating unit with a capacity of 1,350 kilowatts has been officially put into production. In less than a year, a total of 3.35 million cubic meters of earth and stone were excavated, more than 41,000 cubic meters of ashlar were laid, and more than 10,000 cubic meters of rubble were laid.

    The scale of the Longfeng project was unprecedented in Suining County. The large quantities of raw materials and the design and construction forces it required were all things that Suining County had never had before.

    At the beginning of the project, the Suining County Party Committee clearly put forward the construction principles of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" and self-reliance. The power station was constructed using the method of "surveying, designing, and constructing simultaneously." The design of the power station was originally the responsibility of the Chengdu Hydropower Design Institute. Due to the heavy workload of the design institute, design drawings could not be delivered until two months after the start of civil engineering. If work were stopped to wait for the drawings, the 30,000 laborers on the construction site would be idle. This would not only waste manpower, but more importantly, it would prolong the construction period. What to do? After studying the situation, the county party committee decided to design it themselves. They transferred two technicians, one carpenter, and two apprentices from the Shixihao Hydropower Plant to the Nanwan Hydropower Station in Henan to study for six days. After returning, they spent only fifteen days designing a hydropower station with an installed capacity of 8,800 kilowatts. The design drawings were reviewed by the Sichuan Provincial Water Conservancy Department Design Institute and were deemed to meet quality requirements.

    After the design problem was solved, the county party committee began to solve the supply of raw materials. The county party committee transferred several people from the construction site to learn in other places. Once they learned, they used it, and in a short period of time, they established a cement factory that could produce No. 400 cement; then they transferred several workers from the artillery industry to set up a gunpowder factory. When steel was needed, they launched a mass movement to donate steel and iron throughout the county. Without construction personnel, 325 laborers were transferred and formed a technical team after five days of study.

    After solving these problems, new difficulties were encountered in the new process. When the project progressed to the most critical stage, due to the lack of power, not only was the production of cement and lime greatly difficult, but the construction site was also unable to start work due to the lack of power. In addition, the production front needed people, industry needed electricity, and floods were pressing, putting the project in a dilemma. At that time, some advocated abandoning the project, while others advocated resolutely carrying it through to the end. Therefore, under the leadership of the county party committee, the masses launched a large-scale debate. Through debate, the communist spirit of cooperation was promoted, the promoting faction defeated the hindering faction, the enthusiasm of the workers became increasingly high, and the situation of the Great Leap Forward became even more prosperous. At the same time, through internal and external cooperation, a capital of 813,000 yuan was raised, and 200 tons of cement were also solved. In this way, difficulties were overcome time and time again.

    On this power station construction site, there were no cars and no decent machines, and there were no engineers. There were only indigenous tools such as wooden rails, wooden carts, hoes, drill steels, dustpans, and carrying poles. In order to speed up the construction, the county party committee mobilized the masses to contribute ideas and suggestions, and to vigorously carry out tool reforms. In order to vigorously promote advanced tools, 24 iron, wood, and bamboo factories were set up on the construction site, and a large number of various machines suitable for the project were manufactured and promoted. 1,200 cable car groups, 144 indigenous crane groups, and 185 skid boat groups appeared on the construction site, increasing work efficiency by multiples, tens, or even dozens of times.

    In order to encourage the enthusiasm of the laborers in building socialism and to complete the power station as soon as possible, the leaders of the construction site constantly put forward new inspiring slogans. At the beginning of the project, the slogan of making a good start was put forward to the laborers. The Lianyuan team first reported victory, leaping over Shifangguan. The leaders immediately summarized their advanced experience and widely promoted it, quickly creating a new situation in which each team achieved high output every day. The leaders of the construction site cultivated flags of all kinds, men, women, old and young, and set up pacesetters, so that the laborers had role models to learn from. Continuous construction upsurges were organized, so that the project was put into production on September 28 this year. The masses cheered and said: With the Communist Party, the river water flows over the mountains.

### 土洋结合　自力更生　群众办电速度高

    多发电  多供电  支援工农业跃进
    ——全国群英会水利、电力系统经验交流会
    土洋结合　自力更生　群众办电速度高
    四川省遂宁县龙凤水电站代表　李栓堂
    去年，在群众办电和以钢为纲全面大跃进的大好形势带动下，位于四川省遂宁县的龙凤电站开始了修建工作。龙凤电站是一座发电、灌溉、航运综合利用的水利工程。工程的基建任务，包括装机容量八千八百瓩的电站一座，长达二十七公里的引水渠道一条，全部建筑物共有一百零六处。
    这是一座中型的水利工程。然而它却是依靠公社自力更生，在土洋结合的方针指导下建成的。目前这个工程已有一千三百五十瓩一台机组正式投入生产。在一年不到的工期当中，共开挖了三百三十五万立方米的土石方，安砌条石四万一千多立方米，块石一万多立方米。
    龙凤工程这样规模，在遂宁县说来还是破天荒第一次。它需要的大批原料材料，需要的设计和施工力量，这些都是遂宁县过去所没有的。
    工程开始，中共遂宁县委就明确提出了“土洋结合”和自力更生的建设方针。这座电站是采取“边勘测、边设计、边施工”的方法进行的。电站的设计，原来由成都水电设计院负责。由于设计院的任务繁重，以至土建工程开工两个月后，还不能交出设计图纸。这时如果停下工来等待图纸，工地上的三万民工就要窝工。这样，不仅浪费人力，更重要的是延长了工期。怎么办？县委研究了这一情况后，决定自己动手设计。他们从石溪浩水电厂抽调了两名技工，一名木工和两名学徒工到河南南湾水电站去学习了六天，回来后只花了十五天的工夫，就设计好了一座装机容量为八千八百瓩的水电站。设计图纸经四川省水利厅设计院审查认为符合质量要求。
    设计问题解决了，县委就着手解决原料和材料的供应。县委从工地上抽调了几个人到外地去学，学会了就用，在短短的时间内就办起了一座能生产四百号的水泥厂；随即又在作火炮的行业里抽了几个工人办起了火药厂。需要钢铁，就在全县范围内发动群众开展献钢献铁运动。没有施工人员，就抽调三百二十五个民工经过五天学习组成了技术队伍。
    解决了这些问题以后，在新的进程中又遇到了新的困难。工程进展到最紧张的阶段，因动力缺乏，不仅水泥白灰的生产大为困难，施工现场也因缺乏动力，开不了工。加之生产战线要人，工业要电，洪水逼人，使工程处于进退两难的状态。当时有人主张下马，有人主张坚决干到底。于是在县委领导下，发动群众展开了一场大辩论。经过辩论，大兴共产主义协作之风，促进派战胜了促退派，职工干劲越鼓越足，跃进的形势越加高涨；同时经过内外协作解决了资金八十一万三千元，还解决了水泥二百吨，就这样一次又一次地战胜了困难。
    在这个电站工地上，看不到一部汽车，见不到一部像样的机器，也没有一个工程师。这里只有木轨、木斗车、锄头、炮钎、撮箕、扁担之类的土工具。为了加快建设的速度，县委又发动群众献计献策，大闹工具改革。为了大力推广先进工具，先后在工地上办起了铁木、竹工厂二十四个，制造和推广了大量适合工程需要的各种机具；工地上出现了一千二百部架车群，一百四十四架土起重机群，一百八十五只滑船群，成倍、成十倍甚至几十倍的提高了工效。
    为了鼓舞民工建设社会主义的积极性，及早建成电站，工地领导上不断提出新的鼓动口号。工程开始，就向民工提出一定要打响第一炮的口号。莲苑中队首先报捷，跃过十方关，领导上随即总结了他们的先进经验，普遍加以推广，迅速出现了一个各队日日高产的新局面。工地领导上培养了男女老少各色各样的旗帜，树立了标兵，使民工有了学习的榜样。组织了持续不断的施工高潮，使工程在今年9月28日投入了生产。群众欢呼说：有了共产党，河水翻过山。
