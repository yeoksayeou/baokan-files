The midday sun filters through the leaves of the poplar trees onto the meadow in the forest. The blooming irises emit a faint fragrance, the stream babbles around the woodland, and the tinkling of donkey bells rings from the depths of the thickets. In this tranquil setting, a new and vibrant life begins.

The entire manor, men, women, adults, and children, have all come here. They come from the kitchens, stables, and cowsheds of the Zhuangzhai (the manor lord's big house), from the squalid mud huts, and sit on a large patch of grass.

Anyone who glances at this crowd will understand how the serfs have lived. Two or three hundred adults and children, hardly anyone wears a complete set of clothes, all are rough woolen skirts and shirts like tattered burlap sacks, patched upon patched. None of the women are not barefoot. Look! That blind old woman has been led here. Her name is Wuzhu Cuomu, she is sixty-three years old, she worked as a "Lang Sheng" (domestic slave) from the age of eight, and was driven out to beg for food at the age of sixty; that white-haired old woman is Qimei Cuomu. Three generations of her family worked as Lang Sheng in the Zhuangzhai, raising dairy cows for the Xidui (manor manager). Another skinny old woman is Cangjue, her daughter was beaten to death by the landlord's lackeys, and she has brought her grandson. The young and strong are covered in sweat and mud, their hands and feet like iron blocks. The girls' ragged skirts are too short, no matter how hard they try to cover their legs when they sit down. What are they talking about with smiles on their faces?

But these are the people who are going to take control of their own destiny today. What is going to be held here today is the first democratic meeting of Kaison Xika (the manor of the rebel leader Suokang Wangqing Geler).

The meeting begins, people quietly raise their heads, and listen attentively to the speech of Zhang Zengwen, Deputy Secretary of the Shannan Sub-district Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. He said: "Elders, brothers and sisters! Today, we who have suffered, are holding our first meeting. We want to establish an organization of those who have been oppressed in the past, an organization of those who grow crops, a farmers' association. We want to elect our own people to lead us in our emancipation..." Although people do not understand his words, they laugh heartily after they are translated.

People deliberate and discuss for two days, and the list of candidates is announced. "Nima Ciren, Chairman of the Kaison Xika Farmers' Association!" Everyone's eyes are focused on the dark face of a young man in the corner, his forehead is high, and his deep-set eyes flash with kind, deep, and slightly naive look. He succeeded his father as "Chayao" (a kind of agricultural slave) when he was a teenager, and he is twenty-four years old this year. "Vice Chairman Jiga!" People again find the broad-shouldered girl with their eyes. She took over her mother's job as a cook for Xidui since she was a child, and she is also a Lang Sheng. She is a little shy and hides her head in the arms of an old woman with a smile. "Committee member Awang!" He is a poor Chaba, who can never finish paying off the Ula corvee and his wife and six children are all skin and bones from starvation. "Committee member, Doje..." After the list is announced, the nine chairmen, vice chairmen, and committee members of the Farmers' Association are four Lang Sheng, Chayao, three Duikiong, and two poor Chaba.

People are divided into three groups for discussion. In the Duikiong group, an old man with a full beard stood up to speak. His name is Lazhu, and he was a Chaba in his early years. The Ula corvee and usurious loans forced him to escape. After wandering outside for a few years, he came back and was spared a beating by Xidui after everyone pleaded and offered gifts. It was stipulated that he would pay a head tax every year, perform temporary corvee, and be a Duikiong. He said: "Nima Ciren, Jiga,... although some are young and some are women, they are all our own people. I have watched them suffer and grow up since they could walk. Such people, with the education of the Communist Party, will not lead us down the wrong path!"

In the Lang Sheng and Chayao group, people just laugh, and remain silent for a long time, with no one expressing an opinion. The slavery and oppression they have suffered is too deep, and they are not yet accustomed to expressing their opinions independently. After a long time, an old woman said in a low voice: "What that comrade said today is what I have been thinking in my heart, and the people you have chosen are the people I pray for day and night..."

Finally, people sat in a large circle on the grass again. The candidates all stood in front of the table. They, with sweat on their foreheads, and joy in their eyes. When their names were read out again, people's hands were raised high.

The newly elected chairman of the Farmers' Association, Nima Ciren, spoke: "Folks, we are about to be emancipated under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. Everyone has chosen us, we are still like children who have just learned to walk, but with our parents - the Communist Party - leading us, and if we unite as one, we can completely eliminate the rebels and the old system, and we can live a good life!" Then applause and cheers rang out.

Within two or three days, twenty-seven Lang Sheng had settled down, and more than a dozen families lived in the large Zhuangzhai that originally belonged to Suokang's agent. The originally lifeless Zhuangzhai suddenly became lively, and every family was like celebrating a happy event. Early in the morning, some old women came with bottles of newly made "Qiang" (highland barley wine) and pots of butter tea to offer congratulations. The children of the Chaba families helped the Lang Sheng lead over small dairy cows, goats, and piglets. The members of the Farmers' Association were busy distributing furniture to the Lang Sheng, tables, cushions, large copper spoons..., these all belonged to the landlords and landlord agents who participated in the rebellion.

Farmers' Association member Doje's new home is in a large room on the second floor of the Zhuangzhai, facing the street. When we arrived at her home, she had just returned from a meeting. Her younger brother, Duobujin, was sewing the soles of shoes under the window, and her younger sister, Langga, had already prepared dinner. The three siblings sat down to eat. Butter tea, Zanba, and also a vegetable Zanba soup. Sister Doje said: "With a home, even drinking water is sweet!" Without understanding their past suffering, it is difficult to understand their joy today. Their parents were originally Chaba. Twelve years ago, their parents died, and Xidui took back the Chaba land. Twelve-year-old Doje took her baby sister who had just been weaned and worked as a Chayao in the home of a poor Chaba relative. Her eight- or nine-year-old brother was sent by Xidui to a Chaba family to work as a Lang Sheng. When her sister turned eight, she was sent to another large Chaba family to work as a Chayao. From then on, the three siblings were separated and belonged to three masters. Her sister's master was a second landlord, who did not give her enough to eat and often beat and scolded her. When she was herding sheep and carrying water, she would meet her sister and cry, and her sister would also shed tears sadly. Her brother had to do heavy labor while sick, and when he met his sister, she would shed tears sadly. At that time, what else would there be in their lives besides tears? On the night of settling down, the three siblings were so excited that they couldn't sleep. They sat up and discussed their future life. The sister said: "Before the autumn harvest, Langga will stay at home to boil tea, and take care of the donkeys and goats. Duobujin and I will work on the Xika's self-operated land (this year, the landlord's self-operated land is operated by Lang Sheng and Duikiong, and the harvest is divided by them), and do some odd jobs. After the land is distributed in the autumn, we will have nothing to worry about."

Next door is Jiga's family. She is the vice chairman of the Farmers' Association and has just returned from a meeting and is cooking. This tall, big-eyed twenty-one-year-old girl is both quiet and shy. When asked anything, she just smiles. But as soon as she saw the work team's Xiaozhuoma, she spoke like sisters: "Setting up a home, I really never dared to think about it in the past! Because there is no free body to walk around freely, and there is no ready-made door to enter freely!" Jiga's mother was a Lang Sheng of Xidui, working as a cook for Xidui. Her mother secretly used leftover soup to feed her. When she was ten years old, Xidui sent her to a Chaba family to work as a Chayao (eating at the Chaba family and working for the landlord). Later, her mother died from overwork, and Xidui saw that she had grown up, so he took her back to replace her mother. The Xidui family ate and drank all day long, and Jiga was busy in the dark kitchen from morning till night, being smoked by the smoke and fire like a little ghost. At that time, how many times did she want to leave this stuffy Zhuangzhai and get rid of humiliation and beatings, but every time she asked the owner to pay the head tax and leave the Zhuangzhai, she only provoked a scolding from Xidui, or a vicious saying: "You are mine!" "Those who are born as Lang Sheng, are born naked and die naked! Even if the owner lets you go, how can you start a family with empty hands?" She said with emotion, "Now we are liberated, houses, food, everything is readily available, this is all thanks to the Party!"

    第一次过民主生活
    林田、昂旺丁曾
    中午的阳光，从白杨树的枝叶间筛到林中草地上，盛开的马兰花发出微微清香，溪水绕着林园潺潺流过，毛驴啃草的叮叮的铃声，从树丛深处传来。在这个恬静的环境里，新的活跃的生活开始了。
    全庄园的男男女女，大人、孩子，都到这儿来了。他们从庄宅（庄园主的大房子）的灶头、马棚、牛舍里走来，从龌龊的小土屋里走来，在草地上坐了一大片。
    谁只要看一眼这样的人群，就会明白农奴们是怎样生活过来的。大人孩子，二三百人，几乎没有一个人穿一件完整的衣服，全是破麻包片一样的粗毛稀裙衫，补钉上钉补钉。妇女们也没有一个不赤脚。你看！那个瞎老太太被人领来了，她叫乌珠错姆，六十三岁了，她是从八岁作“朗生”（家奴），到了六十岁被赶出来讨饭的；那位白发苍苍的老妈妈，是其美错姆。她母女三代在庄宅里当朗生，给溪堆（庄园管理人）养奶牛。另一个瘦骨嶙嶙的老婆婆是苍觉，她的女儿是被领主的狗腿子活活打死的，她领着外孙儿来了。青壮年们，满脸是汗泥，手脚像铁块。姑娘们的破裙子太短了，坐下来怎样努力也盖不住脚杆。她们在笑迷迷谈论什么呢？
    可是，就是这些人，今天要掌握自己的命运了。今天这里要举行的，是凯松溪卡（叛匪头子索康·旺清格勒的庄园）第一次民主大会。
    会开始了，人们静静地仰着头，全神贯注地听中共山南分工委副书记张增文的讲话。他说：“父老兄弟姐妹们！今天我们受苦受难的人，第一次开大会。我们要成立一个过去受压迫的人的组织，种庄稼的人的组织，农民协会。我们要选出我们自己的人，领导我们闹翻身。……”他的话人们虽然听不懂，一经翻译，大家就嘿嘿地笑了。
    人们酝酿、讨论了两天，候选人名单公布了。“凯松溪卡农会主任委员，尼玛次仁！”大家的目光，都集中在角落里一个青年人黑黝黝的脸上，他额头高高的，深眼窝里闪出善良、深沉而又略带点憨气的目光。他从十多岁起接替父亲作“差徭”（一种农业奴隶），今年二十四岁。“副主任委员基嘉！”人们又用眼睛找到了那个宽肩阔背的姑娘。她从小接替母亲给溪堆作厨子，也是朗生。她有点害羞了，微笑着把头藏在一个大娘的怀里。“委员阿旺！”他是个穷差巴，成年支不完的差役乌拉，老婆和六个孩子都饿得皮包骨头。“委员，多吉……”名单宣布完了，农民协会九个正副主任委员和委员，四个朗生、差徭，三个堆穷，两个穷差巴。
    人们分成三堆进行讨论。在堆穷这一堆里，一个络腮胡子的老大爷站起来讲话了。他叫拉珠，早年是个差巴，乌拉差役、高利贷，逼得他没法生存，就逃跑了。在外边流浪了几年，回来后经大家求情送礼，溪堆才饶了他一顿鞭子。规定他每年交人头税，出临时差，当堆穷。他说：“尼玛次仁，基嘉，……虽然有的年纪轻，有的是妇女，可是他们都是我们自己人。从他们会走路的时候起，我就眼看着他们受苦长大的。这样的人，有共产党教育，是不会向坏道上领我们的！”
    朗生、差徭一群里，人们只是笑，很久很久地沉默着，没人发表意见。他们受的奴役、压迫，太深重了，一时还不习惯于独立发表意见。好一阵子，一个老妈妈才低声说了：“今天那位同志说的，都是我心里话，大家挑选的，是我早晚心里为他们祷告的人，……”
    最后，人们又在草地上坐成了个大圈。候选人都站到桌子跟前来了。他们，额上出了汗，眼睛放出喜悦的光彩。当他们的名字又被念出来的时候，人们的手高高举起来了。
    新当选的农会主任委员尼玛次仁讲话了：“乡亲们，我们在毛主席共产党领导下就要翻身了。大家挑上了我们，我们还像个刚会走路的孩子，不过有我们的父母——共产党，领着我们，我们团结得像一个人一样，我们就能彻底消灭叛匪和旧制度，就能过好日子啦！”接着掌声和欢呼声响成了一片。
    两三天内，有二十七个朗生安了家，十多户就住在原来索康的代理人住的大庄宅里。原来死气沉沉的大庄宅，顿时热闹起来了，家家像在办喜事。清早，有些老婆婆就抱着一瓶瓶新作的“羌”（青稞酒）和一壶壶酥油茶，贺喜来了。差巴家的孩子们，帮着朗生牵来了小奶牛、山羊和小猪。农会委员们忙着给朗生分家具，桌子、垫子、大铜勺……，这些都是参加叛乱的领主和领主代理人的。
    农会委员多吉，新的家就在庄宅二楼一间临街大厢里。我们到她家的时候，她刚开会回来，弟弟多不金，正在窗下纳靴底，小妹妹郎噶已经把晚饭作好了，姊弟三人，坐下来吃饭。酥油茶、?粑、还有青菜?粑汤。姐姐多吉说：“有了家，喝水也是甜的呀！”不了解他们过去的苦难，是难以理解他们今天的喜悦的。他们的父母，原是差巴，十二年前，父母死了，溪堆就收回了差地。十二岁的多吉，就带着刚断奶的小妹妹，到一个亲戚穷差巴家作了差徭，八九岁的弟弟，被溪堆派到一个差巴家当朗生。妹妹到了八岁，就又被派到另一个大差巴家作差徭了。从此，姐弟三人分散了，属于三家主人。妹妹的主人，是个二地主，不给吃饱，又常常打骂。她放羊、背水的时候，碰到姐姐，就哭一场，姐姐也伤心地落泪。弟弟带着病，还要作苦重的劳动，碰到姐姐，姐姐又伤心地落一场泪。那时，他们的生活里除了泪水以外，还会有什么呢？安家的当天晚上，姊弟三人兴奋得无论如何睡不着，他们坐起来商量着今后的生活。姐姐说：“秋收以前，郎噶在家烧烧茶，放放驴子和山羊，我和多不金到溪卡自营地（领主自营地今年由朗生、堆穷经营，收获由他们分）上劳动，再作些短工，等秋后分了地，我们就什么也不愁了。”
    隔壁一家是基嘉。她是农会副主任委员，也是刚开会回来，正在烧饭。这个高个子、大眼睛的二十一岁的姑娘，又沉静，又害羞。问她什么，她只是笑。可是一见了工作队的小卓玛，就像亲姐妹一样说了起来：“安家立灶，过去真是连想也不敢想啊！因为没有自由的身子可以随便走，没有现成的门口可以随便进！”基嘉的母亲是溪堆的朗生，给溪堆当厨子。母亲偷偷用剩汤剩水养活了她。十岁的时候，溪堆就把她派给一家差巴作差徭（吃差巴家饭，给领主干活）。后来，母亲劳累死了，溪堆看她也长大了，就又把她要回来接替母亲。溪堆一家，整天不是吃就是喝，基嘉就从早到晚在黑洞洞的灶房里忙碌，被烟熏火燎得像小鬼一般。那时候，她多少次想离开这个闷人的庄宅，摆脱屈辱和打骂，可是每当她向主人请求交人头税，离开庄宅的时候，只惹来溪堆一顿臭骂，或是恶狠狠地说：“你是我的！”“作朗生的，光着身子生下来，光着身子死去！即便主人放了你，两手空空，又怎么成家呢？”她感慨地说着，“现在我们解放了，房子、粮食，什么都是现成的，这都是党的恩情啊！”
