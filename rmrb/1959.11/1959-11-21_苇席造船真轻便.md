Reed Mat Boatbuilding is Truly Lightweight and Convenient

The employees of the Hebei Province Baoding Shipping Cooperative have successfully trial-produced reed mat boats.

Reed mat boats are light in weight, have a shallow draft, high buoyancy, and a large carrying capacity, making them particularly lightweight to tow with a tugboat. When a reed mat boat with a 13-ton carrying capacity is fully loaded with grain sacks, the hull is neither soft nor leaky, the boat shape remains unchanged, and turning and maneuvering are flexible and convenient.

Reed mat boats are easy to obtain materials for, save labor and materials, and cost 62% less to build than wooden boats of the same tonnage. Moreover, they are easy to repair, eliminating the trouble of annual winter repairs.

    苇席造船真轻便
    河北省保定航运社职工试制苇席船成功。
    苇席船自重轻、吃水浅、浮力大、载重多，用拖轮带起特别轻便。在载重十三吨的苇席船上满载粮食包，船壳不软不漏，船型丝毫不变，拐弯调角灵活方便。
    苇席船取材容易，又省工料，比同吨位木材船造价低百分之六十二。而且修补容易，可免去每年一次冬修的麻烦。
