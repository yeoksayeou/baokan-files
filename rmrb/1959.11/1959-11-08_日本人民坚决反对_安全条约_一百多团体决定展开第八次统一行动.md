Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 5th: The National Council Against Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," composed of more than 160 Japanese groups, decided today to mobilize all forces inside and outside the Diet on November 27 to hold the eighth national unified action against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

    According to the decision, trade unions will hold strikes on this day; delegations composed of workers, farmers, youth, students, women, and intellectuals will go to the Diet, the government, local governments, and local assemblies to petition against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

    The National Council also decided that, in addition to this day, petition delegations should continue to be sent. This action will be held at the same time as the Diet debates the Socialist Party's proposal to suspend negotiations on the revision of the "Security Treaty." The National Council emphasized that this series of actions will guarantee the victory of the subsequent ninth national unified action.

    The National Council decided to convene a meeting of representatives from all walks of life in Tokyo on November 12 in order to prepare for the decisive battle.

    Member groups of the National Council Against Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" are working hard to strengthen the struggle. The Tokyo Joint Struggle Council for the Defense of Peace and Democracy and the All-Japan Student Joint Struggle Council will launch a series of actions on November 12 and 13, including petitioning the Diet, holding public rallies and demonstrations in various districts of Tokyo. The Women's Association for the Protection of National Human Rights plans to hold demonstrations and "mother-daughter meetings" to stop the revision of the "Security Treaty."

    The National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations is scheduled to hold one hundred mass rallies throughout Japan. The National Council's demands during this period are to abandon the attempt to revise the "Security Treaty" and restore Japan-China diplomatic relations.

    The Japanese Communist Party will organize 1,500 large and small gatherings in various places.

    A spokesman for the National Council Against Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" said that, to date, the number of branches established by the National Council in counties, cities, and towns has reached 600, exceeding the number of similar united struggle organizations organized during the opposition to the "Police Duties Law" last autumn.

    日本人民坚决反对“安全条约”
    一百多团体决定展开第八次统一行动
    据新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本一百六十多个团体组成的阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议今天决定，以全力动员国会内外一切力量在11月27日举行第八次反对修改“安全条约”全国统一行动。
    根据决定，工会将在这一天举行罢工；由工人、农民、青年、学生、妇女和知识分子组成代表团到国会、政府和地方政府以及地方议会，进行反对修改“安全条约”的请愿。
    国民会议还决定，除了这一天以外，应继续派遣请愿团。这个行动将在国会辩论社会党准备提出的要求停止谈判修改“安全条约”的提案的同时举行。国民会议强调指出，这一系列的行动将保证随后第九次全国统一行动的胜利。
    国民会议决定11月12日在东京召开各界人民代表会议，以便为决定性的战斗作好准备。
    阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议的会员团体正在努力加强斗争。东京维护和平与民主共同斗争会议和全日本青年学生联合斗争会议将在11月12日和13日展开一系列的行动，包括向国会请愿，在东京各市区举行公众集会和示威。拥护国民人权妇女协议会打算举行阻止修改“安全条约”的示威和“母女大会”。
    恢复日中邦交国民会议预定在日本全国各地举行一百个群众大会。国民会议在这期间的要求是放弃修改“安全条约”的企图和恢复日中邦交。
    日本共产党将在各地组织一千五百个大小集会。
    阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议发言人说，到现在为止，国民会议在县、市和镇建立的分会数目已达六百个，超过了去年秋季反对“警职法”时组织起来的类似的联合斗争组织的数目。
