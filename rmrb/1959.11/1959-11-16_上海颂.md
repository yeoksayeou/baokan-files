    Ode to Shanghai
    Jin Yi (Posthumous Work)
    Now, you have arrived in Shanghai. If you are a first-time visitor, countless new things await you; if you came many years ago, please put aside your outdated impressions and look around. If you can't shake off those old memories for a while, that's fine too, just look and think more, and a clear contrast will emerge. Did you come from the sea, from the air, or by train? If you could take a night flight to Shanghai, that would be wonderful! It can safely transport you while you sleep. Perhaps you can't sleep, and you will see a brightly lit, radiant city on the ground from afar. Yes, Shanghai is approaching. Finally, you arrive in the night sky of Shanghai, the lights seem dim, but the flames soar into the sky, those are the steel furnaces boiling day and night and the two newly built blast furnaces. Many red lights float in the air, those are tall buildings and tall chimneys, and that shining red star is the roof of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building. Crossing the bright Huangpu River, following a row of guiding beacons, the plane can slowly, slowly descend. You feel that the plane has landed, yes, you have arrived in Shanghai, but you can't see anything. It's not too late yet, but the city is quiet, and that deformed nightlife of the past has long disappeared without a trace. But in the factories, the night shift workers who have just taken over are starting work with vigor, night is day, they don't let go of a minute or a second. When seven million residents are asleep, there are always two to three hundred thousand workers working hard, fighting to complete the second five-year plan this year, fighting to catch up with Britain in ten years. If you throw yourself into that bustling workshop, you will be as energetic as your comrades, fighting to greet the dawn.

    You are tired, then rest, you can sleep in the Shanghai Mansion on the banks of the Suzhou River. Your memory is correct, it used to be called Broadway Mansion, but where does Shanghai get Broadway from, wasn't that just the daydream of those imperialist elements and their lackeys, now it belongs to China, it is our Shanghai Mansion. You fall asleep as soon as your head hits the pillow, and you wake up before dawn. You say you dreamed of speeding cars and steamers all night. Comrade, that's not a dream, the trams on the road under the window never stopped all night, and the small steamers towing long strings of wooden boats also worked busily all night; by four or five o'clock in the morning, when you are half-awake, the roads and the river are already bustling, starting a day's battle. You can't see clearly from such a high window, okay, let's go out, let's go to the Huangpu River to greet the sunrise.

    Standing on the Waibaidu Bridge, you can see the boundary where the Suzhou River flows into the Huangpu River, and the Soviet Consulate with the red flag flying above it. Now it's different from the past, you can take a few more glances, even write a poem, and no villains will stare at you; the British Consulate on the other side of the river has been closed for several years. Huangpu Park, where you used to be snubbed many years ago, has already removed its walls, not to mention that ugly sign that says "Chinese and dogs not allowed." Here is a piece of flowers and grass, let tourists stroll and exercise here in the morning and evening, say goodbye to the departing ships, wish them a smooth journey, and welcome the newly arrived ships, expressing the welcome of the Shanghai people. It just so happens that we ran into the Peace No. 28 import, it is the fruit of the Great Leap Forward, but today, our heroic shipbuilding workers, using only nineteen days of slipway cycle, launched the 3,000-ton Peace No. 60 freighter, this is the style of our workers, this is the speed of our industrial production.

    On one side is the surging Huangpu River, and on the other are towering buildings; this was originally a desolate fishing village, the imperialist elements forcibly occupied it, creating it as an inch of land and an inch of gold, and the land price was so scary; therefore, those "adventurers" who wanted to decorate their facades bought a palm-sized piece of land and had to develop towards the sky, because the sky is free. This formed streets without sunlight, cool days without wind, and strong winds that made weak people unable to stand. Those "adventurers" who ran to China to seek fortune, and the pot-bellied capitalists colluded with each other, trying every means to exploit the blood and sweat of the Chinese people. You see that largest building at the intersection of Nanjing Road, which was built by that drug dealer Kadoorie, he truly deserves to be called an old-fashioned vampire, he fattened himself by those Chinese people who were skinny from drug addiction. Countless high-rise buildings were built by Chinese workers, the roads were paved by Chinese workers, but the Chinese people had no freedom on their own land, living the life of cattle and horses. But today, ah, today the Chinese working people are the masters, and those dregs, like the garbage of the Huangpu River, flow out of the Wusongkou and roll into the boundless sea.

    From early morning, the Shanghai people have been singing a magnificent song, no, this song is sung day and night, it has never been finished, and it is becoming more and more majestic, its momentum is more and more magnificent and soaring. Shanghai has millions of industrial workers, who in the seven months of this year, put forward 260,000 technical innovation proposals, 140,000 have been realized, and by the end of August, they had successfully trial-produced 13,717 new varieties and new designs of products, truly as the bold workers proposed, to: "No waste gas in the sky, no waste materials on the ground, no waste liquid underground." Shanghai has large factories with tens of thousands of people, and small factories with a dozen people; there are old factories with more than a hundred years of history, and factories that were built yesterday, or are under construction, some factories can build 10,000-ton seagoing vessels, complete sets of power generation and smelting equipment; and also manufacture extremely precise, extremely fine precision instruments that are almost invisible to the naked eye, spinning 200-count fine yarns that are thinner than hair. In Shanghai, eleven industrial zones and a satellite town have been newly built. The Pengpu Industrial Zone built 215,000 square meters of factory buildings in just one year; Minhang Town built more than 310,000 square meters, of which the metal structure workshop of the boiler factory has more than 38,000 square meters, covering nearly 60 acres, which is as large as two Huangpu Parks! In the early spring of this year, on a cold day, I followed many people to visit there, it was freezing cold, and we had to shrink our heads tightly into our collars in the wilderness; but the female welders stood unshakably high in the sky in the harsh cold wind, like brave goddesses. They wielded their arms freely, and the dazzling electric fire ruthlessly inlaid the molten welding rod in the middle of the steel seams, making them firmly connected together, just like the steel water that had undergone strict tests and flowed out of the same steel furnace, tightly cast into steel ingots. On that narrow roof frame, they squatted down and stood up freely, taking generous strides back and forth, the endless walls and grounds, the endless roof frames, were all welded little by little by them. Regardless of day or night, wind or snow; who gave them strength and courage? Who can make them use the dazzling blue fire to wave out beautiful pictures? If your eyes are good, you can see clearly and far, you can see the calm smiles on their faces, that's when they have done a good job and stand up, but when they concentrate on drilling into the steel, although you can't see the face behind the protective mask, the tense and serious expression is revealed from that motionless posture. They are good daughters of the motherland, since liberation, whether in the high sky, in the sea, in the underground mines, in the deep mountains and valleys, they shine with a different light like the most brilliant golden flowers.

    Speaking of Shanghai's steel mills, they were established a long time ago. In 1949, the annual output was only 6,900 tons, and this year's target is 1.65 million tons, striving for 1.8 million tons. How many times has it increased, please calculate it yourself. Today, there are 100,000 employees fighting in Shanghai's steel mills, producing more than 100 kinds of high and low-grade alloy steels, rolling thousands of kinds of steel products, and supplying the special needs of the whole country. On the road and in the meeting places, you can often see steelworkers wearing work hats inlaid with blue glass, below which are reddened cheekbones, and perhaps a slightly reddened tip of the nose, those are our steelmaking workers. In the near future, we will have more steelmaking hands, standing in front of the scorching steel furnaces, using unparalleled wisdom and courage, to subdue the nearly 2,000-degree rolling steel water!

    Have you read Comrade Chen Yi's poem about ants gnawing on bones? I tell you, that factory is in Shanghai, called the Construction Machinery Factory. Their working method is called crabs eating cattle, this contrast is even greater and more amazing, how can a crab eat an old cow? We have seen ants gnawing on bones, but we have never even thought about crabs eating cattle. In this factory, now the ants have grown wings, flying and jumping, gnawing everywhere, gnawing at will, drilling at will, and licking at will, that is to say, changing that small indigenous machine tool equipment into general-purpose equipment, it is a milling machine, a drilling machine, and a boring machine; as long as you change the tool, you can do anything. One worker is even bolder, with a richer imagination, and stubbornly feels that one knife is not enough, installs four knives, and lets four mouths gnaw at the same time, then he can gnaw more and faster. You think, with such a working method, no matter how big the parts are, they can't scare our workers! The workers in Shanghai, like the workers all over the country, are high-spirited and want to run ahead of time, to be the masters of their work. They have clear goals and open minds; they use both their hands and their brains, and the speed is increased again and again, and they stride forward, leaving time behind. They will use their hands to change the "poor and blank" face of the motherland, so that the motherland, like a galloping horse, leaps forward. New look, new spirit, new generation; it is really turning the world upside down, changing with each passing day; no, in fact, it is changing all the time!

    Yes, you are right, the biggest change in Shanghai, like the whole country, is people. New moral qualities guide people to higher realms. Those days of you cheating me, guarding against each other everywhere, wishing to bite off a piece of each other's flesh are long gone. Being simple and honest, serious and meticulous, caring for others, and loving the collective have become the qualities possessed by ordinary Shanghai people. Today, I saw in the newspaper that last night, more than 200 ten-year-old children held a happy tenth birthday party at the Children's Palace. The one who came into the world on the day of Shanghai's liberation is called "Liberation"; the one who was born on the same day as New China is called "Xinhua." They can truly be said to have a happy birth and a happy growth; each of them holds the happy flowers they made themselves and marches forward on the flat road. Look how well they smile! If you tell these children about some of the strange and bizarre things and the monsters and demons of Shanghai's past, they will widen their eyes and shake their heads desperately. A child's heart is like a clear pool of water that can be seen to the bottom, without a speck of dust, believes what it believes, and doesn't believe what it doesn't believe. When these children grow up, they will be free of worries, with bright eyes, swift hands and feet, picking stars and chasing the moon will not be a big deal. Let's not talk so far, just say the things I personally saw in Shanghai, I'm afraid I won't be able to finish talking about them in three days and three nights. And as soon as I finish talking about them, the situation three days ago has changed again! This is our era, this is our speed. I don't complain at all about being often left behind, let us join hands and run forward, let's work hard, we can still keep pace with our great era and the leaping Shanghai. (Shanghai, 1959, 9)

    上海颂
    靳以  遗作
    现在，你来到上海了。如果你是初来的访问者，正有数不尽的新鲜事物在等待着你；若是你多少年前曾经来过，就请你收拾起陈旧的印象，放眼观看吧。万一你一时丢不开过时的记忆，那也好，你只要多看看再多想想，就会有一幅鲜明的对比。你是从海上来的，或是从空中来的，还是坐火车来的呢？如果你能坐上到上海来的夜航机够多么好！它可以在你睡着的时间，把你平安地送到。也许你睡不着觉，远远地你就会望见大地上一座灯火透亮的发光的城市，不错，上海就要到了。终于，你来到上海的夜空，灯显得不亮，火光却冲天，那是日夜沸腾的炼钢炉和不久才造起来的两座高炉。多少盏红灯浮在空中，那是高大的建筑和高大的烟囱，那个闪亮的红星，却是中苏友好大厦的屋顶。越过发亮的黄浦江，顺着一排指路的灯标，飞机就可以慢慢、慢慢地下来了。你感觉到飞机已经着陆了，不错，你已经到了上海，可是你望不见什么。时间还不太晚啊，市区中却是静悄悄的，过去那种畸形的夜生活早已无影无踪了。可是在厂里，才接班的夜班工人正生气勃勃地开始了工作，黑夜就是白天，他们不放过一分一秒的时间。当七百万居民都已安睡的时候，总有二三十万工人在努力奋战，为今年完成第二个五年计划而战，为实现十年赶上英国而战。如果你投身在那热火朝天的车间里，你也会和同志们一样浑身是劲，奋战迎天明。
    你疲乏了，那么你还是安睡吧，你就睡在苏州河畔的上海大厦里。你的记忆不错，过去它叫什么百老汇大厦，上海哪里来的什么百老汇，还不是那些帝国主义分子和奴才们的白日梦，现在它属于中国，它是我们的上海大厦。你倒头便睡，天还没有亮你就醒转来。你说一夜间都在梦见奔驰的车和汽轮。同志，那不是梦，一夜中窗下大路上的电车没有断过，拖带着一长串木船的小汽轮来来往往也忙了一夜；到了早晨四五点钟，你要醒未醒的时候，大路上，江面上已经忙碌起来了，开始了一天的战斗。这么高的窗口望不清楚的，好，让我们出去吧，让我们到黄浦江边迎接日出吧。
    站在白渡桥上就望得见苏州河流入黄浦江的界线，上边飘着红旗的正是苏联领事馆。现在可不同过去，你多看几眼，甚至于吟诗一首，也没有恶人来盯住你；河那边的英国领事馆几年来却双扉紧闭。多少年前使你碰过钉子的黄浦公园，早已把围墙拆除了，更不要说那块丑恶的“华人与狗不得入内”的牌子。这里是一片花草，让游人清晨黄昏在这里散步锻炼，向离去的船只道别，祝它们一路顺风，迎接才来的船，表示上海人民的欢迎。就有这么巧，咱们又碰上了和平二十八号进口，它是大跃进的果实，可是今天，我们英勇的造船工人，只用了十九天的船台周期，就使三千吨的和平六十号货轮下水了，这是我们工人的气派，这是我们工业生产的速度。
    一面是滚滚长流的黄浦江，一面是矗天的大楼；这里最早是荒凉的渔村，帝国主义分子强占了它，造成它一寸土地一寸金，地价贵得吓死人；因此那些要装点门面的“冒险家”们，买了一块巴掌大的地，只好向空发展，因为天空不要钱。这样就形成了没有太阳的街，没有风的日子很阴凉，有了风就吹得瘦弱的人站不住脚。那些跑到中国找运气的“冒险家”，和大腹便便的资本家狼狈为奸，千方百计压榨中国人民的血汗。你看南京路口那座最大的楼房，就是那个贩卖毒品的克沙逊造的，他真称得起老牌的吸血鬼，他是靠那些由吸毒而骨瘦如柴的中国人，养肥了他自己。无数的高楼是中国工人造的，路是中国工人铺的，单单中国人在自己的土地上没有自由，过着牛马的生活。可是今天，呵，今天中国劳动人民做了主人，那些渣滓就像黄浦江的垃圾一样，流出吴淞口，滚入无边的大海。
    从清早起，上海人民就在唱着一首壮美的歌，不，这首歌是日日夜夜都在唱，从来也没有唱完过，而且是愈唱愈雄伟，气势愈磅礴冲天。上海有上百万产业工人，在今年七个月中间，提了二十六万技术革新建议，十四万个已经实现，到了8月底，试制成功了一万三千七百十七种新品种新花样的产品，真是像豪迈的工人所提出的，要：“天上无废气，地上无废料，地下无废液。”上海有万人的大厂，也有十几个人的小厂；有百年以上的老厂，也有昨天才造起来的，或是正在建造的厂，有的厂能造万吨的大海轮，成套的发电和冶炼设备；也有造极精密、极细微几乎肉眼都看不清的精密仪器，纺出比头发还细的二百支细纱。在上海，新建了十一个工业区和一个卫星城镇，彭浦工业区，只一年时间就造了二十一万五千多平方米的厂房；闵行镇建设了三十一万多平方米，其中锅炉厂的金属结构车间就有三万八千多平方米，占地近六十亩，有两个黄浦公园那么大！在今年早春的一个寒冷的日子里，我曾随着许多人到那里去参观，天寒地冻，在旷野中我们不得不把头紧紧缩在衣领中；可是女电焊工在凛冽的寒风中不可摇撼地挺立在高空。像勇敢的女神一般。她们自如地挥动着手臂，炫眼的电火毫不容情地把溶化的焊条镶在钢缝的中间，让它们坚固地接在一起，就像从同一个炼钢炉中经过严格的考验共同流出的钢水，紧紧地铸成的钢锭。在那狭窄的屋架上她们自在地蹲下又立起，跨开豪迈的步子走来走去，望不断的墙地，接不完的屋顶架，都是由她们一点一点地焊好。不管日里夜里，风里雪里；是谁给了她们力量和勇气？是谁能使她们用耀眼的蓝火挥出美丽的图画？如果你的眼睛好，看得清看得远，就望得见她们脸上的从容的笑，那是她们干好了一桩活，挺身站起来的时候，可是当她们聚精会神地向钢里钻的时候，在防护罩后边的脸虽然看不见，但从那一动不动的姿态中，就显露出紧张严肃的神情。她们是祖国的好女儿，自从解放以来，无论是在高空，在大海，在地下的矿井里，在深山大谷中，她们像最灿烂的金花一样放着异样的光采。
    谈到上海的钢厂，很久以前就建立起来了，在1949年年产只有六千九百吨，今年的指标是一百六十五万吨，争取一百八十万吨。到底增加了多少倍，请你自己算吧。如今在上海钢厂中战斗的就有十万职工，生产一百多种高、低级合金钢，轧制上千种钢材，供应全国的特殊需要。在路上，在会场里，常看得见戴着镶蓝玻璃的工作帽，下边是发红的颧骨，也许有一个微微发红的鼻尖，那就是我们的炼钢工人。不久的将来，我们会有更多的炼钢手，站在炎炎的炼钢炉前，用无比的智慧和魄力，制服近两千度的翻滚的钢水！
    你读过陈毅同志歌唱蚂蚁啃骨头的诗么，我告诉你，那个厂就在上海，叫做建设机器厂。他们的工作法叫蟹吃牛，这个对比更大，更惊人，一只螃蟹怎么吃得进一条老牛？蚂蚁啃骨头我们还看见过，蟹吃牛却是连想也不曾想过的事。在这个厂里，如今蚂蚁长了翅膀，又飞又跳，到处啃，随意啃也随意钻还随意舐，这就是说把那个小土机床设备改为通用设备，又是铣床，又是钻床，又是搪床；只要换上刀具，就什么活都能干。一个工人的胆子更大，幻想力更丰富，硬是一把刀不满足，装上了四把刀，让四张嘴同时啃，那就啃得更多更快。你想，有了这样的工作法，多么大的部件也吓不住咱们工人！上海的工人正和全国工人一样，意气风发，要跑在时间的前边，要做工作的主人。他们目标明确，心境开朗；手脑并用，速度一加再加，大步跨进，把时间丢在后边。他们用双手将改变祖国“一穷二白”的面貌，使祖国像跨上了千里马追风驹向前跃进。新的面貌，新的精神，新的一代人；真是扭转乾坤，日新月异；不，实在说起来，时时刻刻都在变化呵！
    对，你说得对，上海最大的变化和全国一样，是人。新的道德品质引导着人们跨上了更高的境界。过去那种你欺我诈，处处提防，恨不得咬下对方一口肉的日子早已一去不复返了。朴朴实实，认真不苟，关心别人，热爱集体已经成为普通上海人所具备的品德了。今天在报纸上看到昨天晚上，二百多个十整岁的孩子在少年宫举行了幸福十岁联欢会。那个在上海解放的日子来到世界上的就叫做“解放”；那个和新中国同日诞生的叫“新华”。他们真说得上是幸福的诞生和幸福的成长；他们每个人捧着自己做的幸福的花朵在平坦的大路上迈进。你看他们笑得够多么好呵！你如果和这些孩子们说起上海过去光怪陆离和牛鬼蛇神的一些事，他们会睁大了眼睛，死命地摇着头。孩子的心像一望见底的清澈的池水，没有一点尘埃，信就信，不信就不信。当这些孩子长大的时候，一身无牵挂，眼睛明明亮亮，手脚飞快，摘星奔月，都算不得一回事。不要说得那么远吧，就说我个人在上海看到的事，怕三天三夜也说不完。好容易说完了，三天前的情况又变了！这就是我们的时代，这就是我们的速度。我一点也不抱怨常常被丢在后边，让我们拉起手来向前奔跑，好好加一把劲，还是可以同我们的伟大的时代和飞跃向前的上海并驾齐驱的。　（1959，9，上海）
