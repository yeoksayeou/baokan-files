The native train, the native train, chatters away,
With a big mouth open at the front,
Eating twenty dan of earth at a time,
Improving work efficiency wonderfully!
The native train is made of wood,
Moving earth without burning oil,
Regardless of sunshine or rain,
Always running ahead.

    土火车土火车儿叫喳喳，头上开着大嘴巴，一次吃土二十担，提高工效顶呱呱！土火车儿本木头，运土开动不烧油，不管天晴和下雨，始终飞跑在前头。
