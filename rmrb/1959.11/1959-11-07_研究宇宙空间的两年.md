    Two Years of Space Exploration
    Academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Ye.K. Fyodorov
    On October 4, 1957, the first artificial satellite was launched into the upper atmosphere of the Earth. In 1959, the Moon became the object of study through cosmic rockets. This is the speed of development of our country's space exploration work.
    Before the launch of the first satellite, geophysical rockets and meteorological rockets had been launched many times.
    In order to implement the plan of the International Geophysical Year, Soviet scientists launched all 125 high-altitude geophysical rockets and meteorological rockets as planned. The launches were conducted in three regions of the Earth: Franz Josef Land in the Arctic zone, the mid-latitude region of the European part of the Soviet Union, and on the "Ob" ship in Antarctica.
    With the help of rockets, materials on the composition and density of the atmosphere, materials on cosmic rays, materials on the density of electrons and positive ions in the ionosphere, and a lot of information about the characteristics of the upper atmosphere of the Earth up to 500 kilometers were obtained. Many instruments were made for measurement under the special conditions of rocket flight. Some measurements were carried out in special containers, which separated from the rocket during the flight and flew far ahead of the rocket. This was to prevent the gas released by the rocket from affecting the characteristics of the surrounding environment. Soviet designers designed special parachutes, with which the containers carrying instruments and rocket bodies weighing hundreds of kilograms were dropped from hundreds of kilometers above the ground, and the dogs sent to high altitudes by the rockets returned to the ground safely.
    In a series of tests, the rocket flight has been stable.
    Whether in terms of the rocket system used or the scientific results obtained, these many launches are great achievements.
    The launch of artificial satellites is the next stage in the study of the atmosphere and the first step for mankind to step out of the Earth's boundaries. Although American scientists and designers have been publicizing their plans to launch artificial satellites since 1955, and their "Vanguard" satellite patterns have been published in all scientific publications, it is well known that the first artificial satellite was launched by the Soviet Union. Now, two years have passed, and launching such satellites has become commonplace, but huge difficulties had to be overcome.
    The rocket carrying the satellite is not simply reaching the predetermined altitude, but also giving the satellite—a container equipped with various equipment—the speed and direction to enter the predetermined orbit. In order to orbit along a circular or elliptical orbit, the satellite should obtain the so-called first cosmic velocity, which is about eight kilometers per second. It is an extremely complex technology to make heavy containers equipped with instruments and the last stage rocket carrying it reach this speed. At the same time, ensure high accuracy. There must be no error of one degree in the running direction or a slight error in speed.
    The powerful thrust of the rocket engine enables the launch of satellites of considerable weight. This ensures that Soviet scientists can conduct various experiments with satellites. In addition to measuring the characteristics of the surrounding environment, unique biological research was also arranged. In order to control the many instruments on the satellite, a complex but precise program device was made: a temperature control system, a radio transmitter that can quickly transmit the information collected during the flight to the ground station, and many other equipment. In addition to storage batteries and chemical battery packs, the satellite is also equipped with solar battery packs that can convert sunlight into electricity. This battery pack can work indefinitely (the radio transmitter of the third Soviet artificial satellite is still using the electricity from the solar battery pack to send signals).
    Soviet artificial satellites are essentially complex automated laboratories for carrying out extensive measurement plans.
    The launch of the first cosmic rocket by the Soviet Union is a new stage in the conquest of cosmic space. Launching a rocket to a certain target is much more complicated than launching a satellite. Because it first requires a faster speed, in order for an object to overcome the Earth's attraction and escape from the Earth, it needs to reach the second cosmic velocity, which is 11.2 kilometers per second.
    When the rocket obtains the required speed, the rocket enters a predetermined orbit. After the engine stops working, the rocket's flight gradually slows down, and it moves farther and farther away from our planet. In a large distance, the rocket's speed to the Earth exceeds the second cosmic velocity, which is obtained during acceleration. If the rocket is to reach the moon or pass through the moon at a certain short distance, then it must be ensured that the rocket in flight meets the moon, which revolves around the Earth at a speed of one kilometer per second.
    When the rocket approaches the moon, under the influence of the moon's gravity, the rocket's flight speed to the moon continues to accelerate. Near the moon, the rocket's speed to the moon approaches the second cosmic velocity.
    In addition to the Earth and the Moon, the Sun has been influencing the rocket. Obviously, accurately calculating the gravitational fields of some celestial bodies (the positions of these celestial bodies are constantly changing) and calculating the corresponding orbits for cosmic rockets is an extremely complex task.
    However, the more difficult problem is the control of the rocket. An error of one-tenth in direction and a slight error (one ten-thousandth of an error) in the predetermined speed and the actual speed when the last stage rocket enters orbit will inevitably lead to failure.
    After the engines of each stage of the rocket stop working, the rocket's control stops, and the actual orbit of the rocket is monitored by ground radio technology equipment.
    When the Soviet Union launched the first and second cosmic rockets, it created sodium clouds—artificial comets. The formation of sodium clouds makes it possible to correct the actual orbit through optical observation. According to all these data, the electronic computer repeatedly corrects the orbit and determines the time and place where the rocket meets the moon.
    The three cosmic rockets launched by the Soviet Union in 1959 completed tasks that were more complex than each other. The first rocket approached the moon, passed through a predetermined distance not far from the moon (6,000 kilometers), and entered an orbit around the sun, becoming the first artificial planet in the solar system. Various scientific observations were carried out from Earth to the Moon, and radio transmissions were sent for the first time from a distance of approximately 500,000 kilometers.
    The second cosmic rocket was scheduled to fall on the moon. The scientific instruments in the container continued to measure until the rocket collided with the surface of the moon. The reading of the radio altimeter and the radio instrument stopped working at the corresponding time, proving that the rocket hit the target. The mark with the Soviet national emblem was sent to the moon. The third Soviet cosmic rocket is performing more complex tasks. The automatic interplanetary station separated from the last stage rocket and carried out long-term scientific work in the universe.
    The automatic interplanetary station had to fly around the moon, take pictures of the invisible side of the moon, and then fly back towards the Earth. For this reason, the flight speed should be slightly lower than the second cosmic velocity (if it is greater than the second cosmic velocity, it cannot fly back towards the Earth). The automatic interplanetary station bypassed near the moon and entered an orbit suitable for photography, which was achieved by the moon's gravity.
    The automatic interplanetary station is different from the containers on the first and second cosmic rockets: people on Earth can command the automatic interplanetary station, manipulate instruments, and determine the direction of the automatic interplanetary station in cosmic space through some method. When the automatic interplanetary station flew to a place suitable for photography, people on Earth commanded to start photography, the camera lens was aimed at the moon, and many photos were taken.
    The photos developed and processed by automatic devices were broadcast to the Earth via radio. After the automatic interplanetary station completed this task, it continued to operate along an elliptical orbit. The farthest point of its orbit from the Earth is about 480,000 kilometers, and the nearest point is about 40,000 kilometers.
    The scientific measurement results are sent to the Earth every time a radio signal is transmitted. Solar battery packs and storage batteries supply energy to instruments and radio transmitters.
    In recent years, what have we clarified due to the research work carried out by artificial satellites and cosmic rockets?
    There have been fundamental changes in the concept of atmospheric composition and structure. In the past, it was assumed that the atmosphere extended to a height of about 1,000 kilometers above the ground. Observations of auroras illustrated this point. But now it has been found that the density of the atmosphere at an altitude of several hundred kilometers is four to nine times greater than previously assumed, and the distribution range of the atmosphere reaches an altitude of about 3,000 kilometers. At the same time, it was clarified that the atmosphere at such high altitudes is not a stable and uniform medium. Huge fluctuations often occur here, changing the state of the atmosphere. These phenomena are caused by the radiation of the sun. The state of the atmosphere on the half of the Earth that is irradiated by the sun is different from the state of the atmosphere on the half that is not irradiated by the sun. Air samples obtained during the flight of geophysical rockets show that the atmosphere within 100 kilometers is well mixed, and the composition of various gases is similar to that of the ground. However, above 100 kilometers, the atmosphere appears to be stratified, that is, the proportion of light gases increases with altitude. It is not possible to use samples to determine the composition of the atmosphere above 100 to 200 kilometers, because the air density is too low to go up. Therefore, the radio frequency mass spectrometer is used to determine the composition "on site". Several rockets and the third Soviet artificial Earth satellite carried this instrument.
    It turns out that from 90 kilometers upwards, oxygen molecules split into atoms, and above 150 kilometers, only atomic oxygen can be encountered. Above 250 kilometers, nitrogen also dissociates. At a height of 1,000 kilometers, the atmosphere is basically composed of nitrogen and oxygen.
    New materials were obtained about the structure of the ionosphere—the sum of all the ionization layers in the atmosphere distributed at an altitude of 100 kilometers to several hundred kilometers. The properties of the ionosphere were determined by studying the propagation of radio waves emitted by research satellites through the ionosphere and by directly measuring the concentration of electrons and positive ions with instruments.
    In the past, it was believed that the electron concentration decreased rapidly at an altitude of more than 300 kilometers. Now it has been found that at altitudes of approximately 500 kilometers and approximately 800 kilometers, the concentrations are 1 million and 200,000 per cubic centimeter respectively, that is, the distribution of the electron layer is much higher than originally estimated.
    According to the results of measuring the high-altitude magnetic field, it can be determined that the famous strong magnetic anomaly in eastern Siberia is caused by some deep (rather than surface) sources. Due to the rapid changes in the magnetic field when it passes through the atmosphere, it can be speculated that there are currents passing through the upper atmosphere.
    A very important phenomenon was discovered: the radiation belt around the Earth. These radiation belts are caused by the Earth's magnetic field trapping charged particles—electrons, protons. The trapped particles are gathered in some ring-shaped belts, and the axes of these belts are around the Earth, probably at the equator. The first axis is about 1,000 kilometers high, and the second one is about 20,000 kilometers high. The radiation concentrated in these areas is quite strong, and will cause great damage to people if corresponding protective measures are not taken.
    On the other hand, it has been found that the danger of meteors is not as significant as previously estimated.
    The results of Soviet biologists studying the conditions of biological organisms in space flight are very important. Many characteristics of the impact of space flight on the life and activities of the organism can be created in the laboratory. However, there is one characteristic that cannot be created, that is, the impact of weightlessness. The experiments conducted by Soviet scientists with dogs, which everyone knows, enable us to make a very important conclusion: the activity of the organism will not be greatly affected by the lack of gravity. Obviously, this conclusion is of great significance for the design of human space flight.
    It can be seen that in a very short period of time, in two or three years, our knowledge about the cosmic space around the Earth has greatly increased.
    Important information about the moon was obtained.
    For example, it turned out that there is no obvious magnetic field near the moon (that is, a magnetic field exceeding the accuracy of the instrument indication—about 60 gamma), and there is no radiation belt like the one found around the Earth. In the space between the moon and the Earth, the concentration of charged particles dropped to no more than 100 per cubic centimeter, but increased again near the moon. It seems that the moon has a unique (but very sparse) ionosphere. The density of cosmic radiation was measured on the way from the Earth to the Moon, and information was obtained about gamma ray flux, X-rays, and particles of varying energies.
    The photos of the other side of the moon that cannot be seen from the Earth are of great significance.
    For the first time, mankind has obtained a concept of the entire surface of the moon. It turns out that the structure of the "back" of the moon is different from the side facing the Earth. That side is flatter, and there are far fewer "seas" on it—large depressions that appear to be dark spots. There is a very long mountain range. New names have appeared on the lunar map: Moscow Sea, Tsiolkovsky Crater, Lomonosov Crater, Joliot-Curie Crater, Soviet Mountain Range, Sea of ​​Ideals.
    Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev once pointed out that the achievements of the Soviet Union in the study of cosmic space belong to all mankind.
    The launch of geophysical rockets and artificial Earth satellites was carried out according to the plan of the International Geophysical Year. The launch of cosmic rockets is not within this plan, but Soviet scientists immediately announced all the information necessary for observing the rockets to foreign colleagues after the launch. The results of the analysis of the first batch of the most important measurement materials have been published in newspapers and reported at international conferences.
    Soviet scientists believe that the scientific information obtained from such extremely complex and difficult experiments as launching satellites and cosmic rockets should be most fully utilized by the world's scientific community.
    Launching satellites is an expensive and complex experiment. Not all countries have enough resources to launch high-altitude rockets. Only the most technologically advanced countries have the power to launch artificial satellites and cosmic rockets into space. However, many scientific institutions and many scientists from various countries are conducting research on cosmic space. Any country that launches a satellite makes it possible for scientists from other countries to observe the satellite and use it to study atmospheric composition, the propagation of radio waves, and other phenomena.
    In order to facilitate scientists from various countries to observe satellites, Soviet scientific institutions have published ephemeris tables, that is, information about the instantaneous position of satellites in the sky, the frequency and operating system of radio transmitters, and other information. These materials ensure that a wide range of scientists and any scientific institutions can conduct observations that they are interested in. The research results of high-altitude rockets and artificial Earth satellites are regularly reported in scientific publications and general newspapers, so that the vast scientific community of various countries can understand them. Soviet newspapers regularly published scientific reports summarizing preliminary research. The Soviet Academy of Sciences quickly published and widely disseminated individual articles and collections of scientific articles on the research results conducted by rockets and satellites.
    This is how cosmic space is being studied. In the past two years, a lot of work has been done, but this is only a beginning, only the first step for mankind to step out of its own planet. This step was taken by a socialist camp, a country that is building communism, which is completely in line with the law. Some people in capitalist countries are still trying to excuse themselves, saying that our achievements in the development of rocket technology and space exploration are the result of individual "breakthroughs" in a certain narrow field of the national economy. We and you all know that this is not the case.
    The achievements in conquering cosmic space, as well as the achievements in all aspects of human activities, are the result of development along the socialist path. These achievements appear faster in some fields and later in others, but their foundation is common.
    We know that our Chinese friends are cheering with us for the achievements of the Soviet Union in conquering cosmic space, just as we cheer when we see the powerful Chinese people who have been liberated from generations of oppression striding forward.

    研究宇宙空间的两年
    苏联科学院通讯院士　叶·克·费奥多罗夫
    1957年10月4日第一个人造卫星射入地球大气高层。1959年，月球成了通过宇宙火箭进行研究的对象。这就是我国宇宙空间研究工作的发展速度。
    在第一个卫星的发射之前，曾经多次放射地球物理火箭和气象火箭。
    为了执行国际地球物理年的计划，苏联科学家发射了预定发射的全部一百二十五个高空地球物理火箭和气象火箭，发射是在地球上三个地区进行的——北极带的法兰士约瑟夫地、苏联欧洲部分的中纬度地区和在南极的“鄂毕号”船上。
    借助火箭得到了关于大气层的成分和密度的材料、关于宇宙线的材料、关于电离层中电子和正离子的密度的材料，以及关于高达五百公里的地球大气高层的特征的很多情报。为了在火箭飞行的特殊条件下进行测量，制成了很多仪器。一些测量是在专门的容器内进行的，这些容器在飞行中脱离了火箭并远远地飞在火箭的前面。这是为了使火箭放出的气体不致影响周围环境的特征。苏联设计师们设计了特殊的降落伞，带有仪器的容器和重达数百公斤的火箭体用这个降落伞从数百公里的高空降落到地球上来，被火箭送到高空去的狗平安地回到了地面。
    在一系列试验中，火箭飞行一直是稳定的。
    无论在所使用的火箭系统方面，还是在取得的科学结果方面，这许多次的发射都是极大的成就。
    人造卫星的发射是研究大气层的下一个阶段，是人类跨出地球范围的第一步。尽管美国的科学家和设计师们从1955年起就大肆宣传他们发射人造卫星的计划，他们的“先锋号”卫星图案载遍了所有的科学刊物，但是，众所周知，第一个人造卫星是苏联发射的，现在，两年过去了，发射这种卫星已经是平常事了，但是，这曾经不得不克服巨大的困难。
    运载卫星的火箭不是简单地达到预定的高度就算了，而且要给卫星——装有各种设备的容器——以能使它进入预定轨道的运行速度和方向。为了沿着圆形或椭圆形的轨道运行，卫星应得到所谓第一宇宙速度，即每秒约八公里。要使装有仪器的沉重的容器和带着它的最后一级火箭达到这种速度，是一种极其复杂的技术。同时要保证高度准确性。不能在运行方向上产生一度的误差或在速度上发生细微的误差。
    火箭发动机的强大推力使得重量很大的卫星能够发射出去。这就保证了苏联科学家能够用卫星进行各种试验。除测量周围环境的特征外，还安排了独特的生物学研究。为了操纵卫星上的很多仪器，制成了复杂的、但是工作很精确的程序装置：调节温度系统、能够很快地向地面站发射在飞行期间所收集的情报的无线电发射机，以及很多其他设备。在卫星上除了装有蓄电池和化学电池组以外，还装有能够把太阳光转变为电能的太阳能电池组，这种电池组能够无限期地工作（苏联第三个人造卫星的无线电发射机至今还在利用太阳能电池组的电能发出信号）。
    苏联人造卫星实质上是进行广泛测量计划复杂的自动化实验室。
    苏联发射第一个宇宙火箭，是征服宇宙空间方面的新阶段。向一定目标发射火箭，要比发射卫星复杂得多。因为这首先要求有更快的速度，为了使物体能够克服地球的吸引力和脱离地球，需要达到第二宇宙速度，即每秒十一点二公里。
    当火箭获得所要求的速度之后，火箭就进入预定的轨道。在发动机停止工作后，火箭的飞行就逐渐地慢下来，这时，它就越来越远地离开我们的星球。在很大的一段距离中间，火箭对地球的速度超过第二宇宙速度，这种速度是在加速中获得的。如果火箭要到达月球或者在一定的短距离上通过月球，那末就得保证飞行中的火箭同以每秒钟一公里的速度围绕地球运行的月球相会。
    在火箭靠近月球时，在月球引力的影响下，火箭对月球的飞行速度不断加速。在月球附近，火箭对月球的速度接近于第二宇宙速度。
    除了地球和月球之外，太阳对火箭也一直有影响。很显然，准确地计算出一些天体的引力场（这些天体的位置是一直在变动）和为宇宙火箭计算出相应的轨道，这是一个极复杂的任务。
    但是，更大的困难问题是火箭操纵的问题。方向上的十分之一的误差以及在最后一级火箭进入轨道时的预定速度和实际速度上的微小的误差（万分之一的误差），就必然会导至失败。
    在各级火箭的发动机停止工作之后，火箭的操纵就停止，而由地面上的无线电技术装置监视火箭的实际轨道。
    苏联在发射第一个和第二个宇宙火箭时，制造了钠云——人造彗星。钠云的形成使得有可能通过光学观测校正实际轨道。根据这一切数据，电子计算机一再校正轨道，确定火箭同月球相会的时间和地点。
    1959年苏联发射的三个宇宙火箭，完成了一次比一次复杂的多种任务。第一个火箭接近月球，在预定的离月球不远（六千公里）的地方穿过，进入围绕太阳的轨道，变成了太阳系的第一个人造行星。在从地球飞向月球时，进行了各种科学观测，并第一次从约五十万公里的距离进行无线电发报。
    第二个宇宙火箭是预定落到月球上的。容器内的科学仪器在火箭与月球表面相碰之前一直进行测量工作。无线电测高计的度数和无线电仪器在相应时间内停止工作，证明火箭击中了目标。带有苏联国徽的标记被送到了月球。第三个苏联宇宙火箭执行着更加复杂的任务。自动行星际站脱离最后一级火箭，在宇宙中进行长期的科学工作。
    自动行星际站要绕过月球飞行，拍摄月球的不可见面的照片，然后向地球方向飞行。为此，飞行的速度要略低于第二宇宙速度（如果大于第二宇宙速度，便不能向地球方向飞回）。自动行星际站在月球附近绕过，并进入便于摄影的轨道，这是依靠月球引力来实现的。
    自动行星际站与第一个和第二个宇宙火箭上的容器不同：人在地球上可以指挥自动行星际站，操纵仪器，并通过某种方法确定自动行星际站在宇宙空间的方向。当自动行星际站飞到便于摄影的地方时，人在地球上命令开始摄影，摄影机的镜头对准月球，并拍摄下许多照片。
    用自动装置显影和整理过的照片，通过无线电播送到地球。自动行星际站完成这项的任务以后，沿着椭圆形轨道继续运转。其轨道离地球最远点大约为四十八万公里，最近点大约为四万公里。
    科学测量成果在每次无线电发射讯号时发到地球上来。太阳能电池组和蓄电池供应仪器和无线电发射机的能量。
    最近几年，由于人造卫星和宇宙火箭进行的研究工作，我们搞清楚了哪些东西呢？
    对于大气成分和结构的概念有了根本的改变。过去假设，大气层一直伸延到离地面高约一千公里的地方。对极光的观察说明了这点。可是现在发现，大气层在几百公里高空的密度比过去假设的要大四至九倍，而大气层的分布范围大约达到三千公里的高空。同时弄明了这样一个情况：在这样高空的大气层不是稳定和均匀的媒质。这里经常发生巨大波动，改变大气层的状态。这些现象是由于太阳的辐射作用而造成的。太阳照射到的地球那半面的大气层状态与太阳未照射到的那半面大气层的状态是不同的。地球物理火箭在飞行时所取得的空气样品表明，一百公里以内的大气层混和得很好，各种气体的组成和地面相仿。但是在一百公里以上，大气层出现了分层，即：轻气体的比重随着高度而增加。没有可能利用试样来确定一百到二百公里以上大气的成分，因为往上去空气密度太小了。因此，就用射频质谱仪在“现场”确定成分，几个火箭和苏联第三个人造地球卫星上就带了这种仪器。
    原来，从九十公里开始往上，氧分子分裂成原子，而在一百五十公里以上，只能碰到原子态的氧。在二百五十公里以上，氮也离解了。到一千公里的高处，大气基本上由氮和氧组成。
    获得了关于电离层——分布在一百公里到数百公里的高空的大气中的各电离层的总和——的结构的新材料。用研究卫星发出的无线电波通过电离层的传播情况的方法以及用直接测量电子和正离子浓度的仪器确定了电离层的性质。
    过去曾经认为，在三百公里以上的高空电子浓度迅速减低。现在发现，约五百公里和约八百公里的高空，浓度相应为每立方厘米一百万和二十万，即电子层的分布要比原先估计的高得多。
    根据测量高空磁场的结果可以确定，东西伯利亚有名的强烈的磁力异常是由某些深处的（而不是表面的）来源所引起的。由于磁场通过大气时发生迅速变化，可以推测有通过大气高层的电流存在。
    发现了一个极重要的现象：地球周围的辐射带。这些辐射带是由于地球磁场吸住带电粒子——电子、质子——而产生的。被吸住的粒子聚集在一些环形带中，这些带的轴线绕着地球，大概在赤道面的位置，第一条轴线高约一千公里，第二条高约二万公里。集中在这些区的辐射是相当强的，如果不采取相应的防御措施，会给人带来很大的损害。
    另一方面，已经查明，流星的危险性没有以前估计的那么大的意义。
    苏联生物学家研究生物机体在宇宙飞行条件下的情况，这种研究结果是非常重要的。宇宙飞行对机体的生命和活动产生影响的许多特点可以在实验室中制造。但是，其中有一个特点是无法制造的，那就是失重的影响。大家所知道的、苏联科学家用狗进行的试验，使我们有可能作出一个非常重要的结论：机体的活动不会因为没有引力作用而受到重大的影响。显然，这个结论对于设计人的宇宙飞行，有重大意义。
    由此可见，在很短一段时期内，在两三年中，我们关于地球周围的宇宙空间的知识已经大大增长了。
    获得了关于月球的重要资料。
    例如，原来在月球附近没有明显的磁场（即超过仪器指示精确度——约六十伽傌的磁场），也没有像在地球周围发现的那种辐射带。在月球和地球之间的空间，带电粒子的浓度下降到不超过每立方厘米一百，而到月球附近却又增加了。好像月球有一个独特的（不过是非常稀疏的）电离层。在从地球到月球的路上，对宇宙辐射的密度作了测量，获得了关于丙种射线流、X射线和能量大小不等的粒子的资料。
    从地球上看不到的月球的那一面的照片有重大的意义。
    人类首次获得了关于月球的整个表面的概念。原来，月球的“后”面的结构同朝着地球这一面是有所不同的。那一面比较平坦，在上面“海”——看起来是暗斑的大凹地——要少得多。有一条很长的山脉。月面图上出现了新的名称：莫斯科海、齐奥尔科夫斯基寰形山、洛蒙诺索夫寰形山、约里奥—居里寰形山，苏维埃山系、理想海。
    尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫曾经指出，苏联在研究宇宙空间方面的成就是属于全人类的。
    地球物理火箭和人造地球卫星的发射是按照国际地球物理年的计划进行的。宇宙火箭的发射不在这个计划之内，但是，苏联科学家在发射后马上就把观察火箭所必需的全部情报向外国同行宣布。首批最重要的测量材料分析的结果已在报刊上发表，并在国际会议上作了报告。
    苏联科学家认为，像发射卫星和宇宙火箭这样一些极为复杂和困难的实验所得到的科学情报，应当让全世界科学界最充分地加以利用。
    发射卫星是一种昂贵的复杂的实验。远不是所有国家都有足够的资源来发射高空火箭的。向空间发射人造卫星和宇宙火箭，只有科学技术最发达的国家才有力量办到。但是，对宇宙空间进行研究的则有各国的许多科学机关和许多科学家。任何一国发射卫星，都使得别国的科学家有可能观察卫星并利用它来研究大气成分、电波的散布等等现象。
    为了便于各国科学家能够观察卫星，苏联科学机关公布了星历表，即关于卫星在天空上各瞬时位置的情报、无线电发射机的频率和工作制以及其他资料，这些资料保证了广大科学家和任何科学机关能够进行他们感到兴趣的观察。在科学刊物和一般报纸上定期地报道了高空火箭和人造地球卫星的研究结果，以便使各国广大科学界人士了解它们。苏联报纸定期地发表了初步研究总结的科学报告。苏联科学院很快地出版了和广泛传播了关于火箭和卫星所进行的研究结果的个别文章和科学文章汇集。
    宇宙空间的研究就是这样进行着。两年来，做了很多工作，但是，这仅仅是一个开始，仅仅是人类走出自己行星的第一步。这一步是一个属于社会主义阵营的、正在建设共产主义的国家做出的，这是完全合乎规律的。资本主义国家中的某些人到目前为止还在聊以解嘲，说我们在火箭技术发展方面和宇宙空间研究方面的成就是某种狭隘的国民经济领域内个别“突进”的结果。我们和你们都晓得，情况并不是这样。
    征服宇宙空间的成就，以及人类活动的各个方面的成就，是沿着社会主义道路发展的结果。这些成就在某些领域内出现得快些，而在另一些领域内出现得迟些，但是，它们的基础是共同的。
    我们知道，我们的中国朋友们同我们一起为苏联征服宇宙空间的成就而欢欣鼓舞，正像我们看到从世世代代压迫下解放出来的强大的中国人民大踏步迈进时欢欣鼓舞一样。
