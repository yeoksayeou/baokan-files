In Chengjiang People's Commune, Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, the Chengjiang River flows directly into the East China Sea, with dozens of miles of orange groves lining both banks. This area is famous for producing Huangyan honey oranges, accounting for 90% of the county's total output. Surrounding the orange groves are over 80,000 mu of rice paddies, with fertile soil and abundant water. Those who have visited Chengjiang praise its beauty and richness.

However, before liberation, both grain and orange yields were very low in this area. Due to price gouging by speculative merchants, in some years, the price of oranges was even lower than that of sweet potatoes and cabbage, and they often couldn't be sold at all, rotting in piles. After liberation, production saw significant development. In the year since communization, Chengjiang's appearance has undergone even more dramatic changes.

In the first year after communization, grain crops achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The unit yield of spring crops increased by 33% compared to last year, and due to the expansion of planting area, the total output increased by 110%. Early rice production created the highest record in Chengjiang's history, with an average yield of 610 jin per mu, an increase of nearly 20% compared to 1958.

This year, the tangerines will also have an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an estimated total output of 700,000 dan, an increase of 16% compared to last year's exceptional harvest. Currently, the dense branches are covered with golden fruits, and early oranges have already begun to be picked. Female commune members in red and green, picking oranges with both hands, sing constantly, expressing the joy in their hearts, celebrating the harvest, and praising the commune.

Grain and Oranges Achieve Bumper Harvests Simultaneously

Huangyan honey oranges have a history of over 800 years. Traditionally, high yields occurred in "good years" and low yields in "bad years"; over time, people came to regard this abnormal situation as "natural law." In fact, this did not depend on nature, but on the limitations of various conditions in the era of small-scale peasant economy. In the past, individual farmers were weak and lacked resources, and when a "bad year" came, they didn't cultivate and manage the orchards properly, which made the "bad year" even more lean. When facing natural disasters such as drought, flood, wind, frost, pests, and diseases, the small-scale peasant economy was even more unable to resist them. Even in the advanced agricultural cooperatives, eliminating the difference between "good" and "bad" years was limited by various conditions. In 1958, the battle drum of the Great Leap Forward was sounded, and the cooperative members thoroughly criticized "the theory of conditions as everything" and "the theory of habit," promoted the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act. Although that year was a "bad year," the orange yields in many advanced agricultural cooperatives actually exceeded those of "good years"; however, the strength of advanced agricultural cooperatives was ultimately limited, and some advanced agricultural cooperatives still had the difference between "good" and "bad" years.

Since the establishment of the people's commune, in order to completely eliminate the difference between "good" and "bad" years, the commune members, relying on the strength of the people's commune, implemented many new technologies and measures. This year, the commune organized women's pest control teams, comprehensively spraying potent pesticides, for the first time eliminating the losses caused by pests and diseases. The entire commune invested more than 80,000 workdays in constructing water conservancy projects in the orange groves, ensuring that the orange trees would not rot or have yellow leaves during the plum rain season, and would not lack water during droughts. The entire commune fertilized the orange trees three to four times, increasing the amount of fertilizer by more than 50%. Pruning and trimming work also increased from once a year in the past to twice. The entire commune also adjusted more than 6,000 mu of intercropped orange groves, and transformed more than 5,500 mu of backward orange groves with thin soil, abundant weeds, and poor water conservancy conditions, etc. These were all things that could not be done during the time of the advanced agricultural cooperatives.

While eliminating the difference between "good" and "bad" years in citrus production, Chengjiang Commune also saw a leap in grain production. This commune has historically been a grain-deficient area. In 1958, 50 production teams in the entire commune were already able to be self-sufficient in grain; this year, 46 production teams have a surplus of grain. For example, the Huangxi production team, with an average of only five fen of land per person, lacked 78,000 jin of grain in 1957 and 51,000 jin of grain in 1958, but this year, in addition to retaining enough grain for rations and completing the state grain purchase tasks, they also have more than 50,000 jin of reserve grain.

No Competition for Labor, No Competition for Fertilizer

The emergence of a situation of simultaneous leaps in grain and orange production in 1959 has profound significance. For a long time, there has been a contradiction between orange and grain production, which is primarily manifested in the competition for labor. For example, during the spring plowing and rice transplanting season, the orange groves also need to be cleared, fertilized, and loosened; during the summer harvest and planting season, it is also the time for citrus pest control and fertilization; and during the autumn harvest and winter planting, the commune members say that it is "three gongs being struck at the same time," requiring both the urgent harvesting and planting of crops and the picking of oranges. The contradiction of labor has not been resolved for a long time. Gradually, the commune members developed the idea of valuing oranges over grain, and used more labor in the orange groves. As a result, while orange production increased, grain production was not high. If the commune members valued grain over oranges, the opposite situation would occur. In 1951, the orange farmers of the Huijiang production team were allocated land and urgently demanded more grain. At that time, the price of oranges was not high, and a widespread phenomenon of valuing grain over oranges occurred. This year, rice production increased by 26% compared to the previous year, while the value of citrus production decreased by 20% compared to the previous year. After the cooperative movement, it was emphasized that grain and oranges must be developed simultaneously, but because the labor problem was not fundamentally resolved, the development of citrus and grain production was also limited.

After communization, the demands for citrus and grain production became even higher. In order to improve citrus production, many new technologies and measures must be implemented, which requires a large investment of labor; rice production also needs to fully implement the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture," which also requires more labor; and diversified operations, commune-run industries, and other productions also need labor. Due to the role of the people's commune in being larger in scale and having a higher degree of public ownership, labor was properly arranged, and citrus and grain both achieved unprecedented bumper harvests.

Why can the commune resolve the long-standing contradiction of competition for labor?

1. After communization, collective welfare undertakings were universally held in rural areas, enabling more than 25,000 women in the entire commune to step out of the kitchen and become a vital force on the agricultural front. Shortly after the commune was established in 1958, male laborers were invested in the autumn harvest and winter planting, and all the women were responsible for picking oranges. During the early rice transplanting this year, women were responsible for clearing the orchards, pruning branches, operating waterwheels, and pulling seedlings. Before communization, the amount of work completed by women accounted for only about 10% of all agricultural work. After communization, the amount of work completed by women accounted for 45% of all agricultural work.

2. After communization, the labor force of the entire commune can be uniformly arranged and deployed on a larger scale, resulting in more reasonable and effective use than before. Each production team has formed various specialized teams according to the strengths of full and half-laborers, both men and women. The labor efficiency of the entire commune has increased by about 50%, which is equivalent to adding half of the labor force to the commune.

3. Because the commune has a large population, strong strength, abundant funds, and the ability to carry out large-scale farmland water conservancy construction and purchase various agricultural machinery. The entire commune has built 366 reservoirs, canals, and ponds, increasing the irrigated area by more than 43,000 mu, which is estimated to save more than 190,000 workdays a year. The commune purchased 547 threshing machines, 395 rice transplanters, and 79 water pumps, which can save a total of 290,000 workdays, also opening up a bright prospect for agricultural mechanization.

4. The entire commune has 12,000 mu of intercropped fields and 6,000 mu of intercropped orange groves, which, after adjustment, can save 150,000 workdays.

The above four aspects can increase about 8 million workdays. Calculating based on one full laborer working 400 workdays per year, the entire commune is equivalent to increasing 20,000 full laborers.

Another important reason for guaranteeing a double harvest of grain and oranges this year is that the people's commune has solved the contradiction of competition for fertilizer between oranges and grain. Before communization, fertilizer was insufficient, and the contradiction of competition for fertilizer between oranges and grain was very large. In recent years, citrus income has been high, and orange farmers generally put fertilizer into the orange groves first, which made the phenomenon of rice lacking fertilizer more serious. Before the spring plowing, oranges need to be fertilized with "pre-flowering fertilizer," which requires manure, and early rice also needs to use manure as base fertilizer. The rice was neglected. In June and July, oranges need to be fertilized with human waste and chemical fertilizers, and at this time, late rice also needs topdressing. As a result, it was "one bowl of rice for two people," and everyone was not full. After the citrus is harvested, winter fertilization must be carried out immediately, which makes the fertilizer for winter planting tight. After communization, how is this contradiction resolved? The commune conscientiously implemented the policy of emphasizing oranges, grain, and livestock equally, vigorously developing animal husbandry, and increasing the accumulation of pig manure fertilizer. From the production team, the brigade, to the commune, livestock farms have been established, and public raising has also driven the large-scale development of private livestock raising. Due to the development of animal husbandry, the entire commune produces about 2.25 million dan of pig manure fertilizer annually. At the same time, more people were drawn to form specialized fertilizer accumulation teams, accumulating large amounts of native and miscellaneous fertilizers, and vigorously producing native chemical fertilizers. Since communization, the entire commune has accumulated a total of 22.92 million dan of various native and miscellaneous fertilizers, and produced 4,200 dan of native chemical fertilizers. In addition, since the commune has abundant funds, commercial fertilizers have also greatly increased. With more fertilizer, the contradiction of competition for fertilizer between oranges and grain has been basically resolved, and the level of fertilization has been greatly improved compared to the past. According to surveys, the amount of fertilizer applied to rice in the entire commune has increased by about 120%, and the amount of fertilizer applied to citrus has increased by half.

Grain Areas Become Rich, Orange Areas Become Richer

Most of this commune is a citrus-producing area, and citrus income is large, so the economy of the citrus-producing area is prosperous, and the economic income of the grain-producing area is much lower than that of the citrus-producing area. In less than a year since communization, this situation has undergone fundamental changes. The grain-producing area has changed from poor to rich, and the citrus-producing area has become even richer. We can get a glimpse of this from the changes in the following two production teams.

Huangtuling production team is a semi-mountainous area that only grows rice. In the past, due to low grain yields, the state had to supply 20,000 jin of grain in 1957. In 1959, early rice production increased by 24.6% compared to 1958. In addition to retaining enough rations, seeds, and feed, they also sold 122,000 jin of surplus grain and supplied 5,100 jin of grain and 16,800 jin of potatoes to fraternal production teams. The total income of this team in the first half of this year reached 44,339 yuan, close to the level of the total income for the entire year of 1958. Currently, in addition to repaying bank loans and other expenses of 2,300 yuan, investing in basic construction of more than 3,000 yuan, and lending more than 1,500 yuan to fraternal production teams, the average annual income of each commune member can catch up with the level of rich teams in citrus-producing areas.

Another is the Huijiang production team in the citrus-producing area, which was relatively prosperous in the past, and has become even richer after communization. While ensuring the increase in orange production, this production team has focused on grain production, animal husbandry, and diversified operations, so its income has greatly increased. Compared with 1958, this year's agricultural income is expected to increase by 120%, citrus income by 0.9%, livestock income by 570%, and sideline income by 390%, with a total annual income increase of about 39%. Now, the commune members of this team all have surplus grain, and every household has savings in the bank.

The tremendous changes in Chengjiang Commune in the year since its establishment fully demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune.

    树上桔红如火　田间稻谷铺金
    朱剑群
    浙江省黄岩县澄江人民公社，有一条直通东海的澄江贯穿其间，两岸是连绵数十里的桔林。这里盛产闻名的黄岩蜜桔，产量占全县产量的90％。桔园的周围，有八万多亩稻田，土肥水足。来过澄江的人，都称赞它的美丽和富饶。
    但是，这个地方解放前粮食和桔子的产量都很低。由于投机奸商压价收购，有的年头，桔价贱到不如番薯和白菜，甚至根本卖不出去，成堆烂掉。解放以后，生产有了显著的发展。公社化一年来，澄江的面貌更是焕然一新。
    公社化后的第一年，粮食作物获得了空前大丰收。小春作物的单位产量比去年增加三成三，由于面积扩大，总产量增加一倍一。早稻产量创造了澄江历史上最高纪录，平均亩产六百一十斤，比1958年增加近二成。
    今年柑桔也将获得史无前例的丰收，预计总产量将达到七十万担，比去年的特大丰收还要增产一成六。目前，茂密的枝条上缀满金黄色的果实，早桔已经开始采摘了。穿红着绿的女社员们，两手采桔，歌声不绝，她们要唱出心底的喜悦，庆丰收，赞公社。
    粮食柑桔一齐丰收
    黄岩蜜桔有八百多年历史了。向来是大年产量比较高，小年产量比较低；久而久之，人们就把这种不正常的情况看作是“天经地义”的了。其实，这不在于天，而在于小农经济时代各种条件的限制。过去个体农民力量单薄，轮到小年不加培育管理，这就使小年更加歉收；碰到旱、涝、风、冻、病虫等自然灾害，小农经济更无法抗御。就是高级社的时候，消灭大、小年的差别也受各种条件限制。1958年敲起大跃进的战鼓，社员们彻底批驳了“唯条件论”和“习惯论”，发扬了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，这一年虽然是小年，许多高级社的桔园产量反而超过了大年；但是高级社力量究竟是有限的，有一些高级社仍有大、小年的差别。
    自从建立人民公社以后，社员们为了彻底消灭大、小年的差别，依靠人民公社的力量，推行了许多新技术与新措施。今年公社组织了妇女治虫专业队，全面喷射了烈性农药，破天荒第一次免除了病虫害带来的损失。全社投放了八万多工，建设桔园水利，做到霉雨时节桔树不烂根不黄叶；天旱少雨桔树也不缺水。全社桔树施肥三次到四次，施肥量增加50％以上。修剪整枝工作也由过去一年一次增加到两次。全社还调整了六千多亩插花桔园，改造了五千五百多亩土薄、草多、水利条件差的落后桔园，等等。这些都是高级社的时候办不到的。
    澄江公社在消灭柑桔生产大、小年差别的同时，粮食生产也飞跃发展。这个公社历年是个缺粮的地区，1958年全社有五十个生产队已经能够粮食自给；今年有四十六个生产队，粮食已经自给有余。如黄西生产队，每人平均只有五分田，1957年缺粮七万八千斤，1958年缺粮五万一千斤，但是今年除了留足口粮和完成国家粮食征购任务以外，还有五万多斤储备粮。
    不争劳力　不争肥
    1959年出现粮桔共同跃进的局面，这个变化是有深刻意义的。长期以来，桔粮生产就存在着矛盾，首先突出地表现在互争劳力上。比如在春耕插秧的时候，桔园又要清园、施肥、松土；夏收夏种的时候，又是柑桔除虫、施肥的时候；到了秋收冬种，社员们说，那是“三面锣鼓一起敲”，既要抢收抢种，又要采摘桔子。劳动力的矛盾，长期解决不了。社员们逐渐地便产生了重桔轻粮的思想，把劳动力多用到桔园里。结果桔子虽然增产，粮食产量却不高。要是社员重粮轻桔，就出现相反的情况。1951年汇江生产队的桔农分到了田地，迫切要求多吃粮食，当时桔子价格又不高，普遍产生重粮轻桔的现象。这一年水稻产量比前一年增长了26％。而柑桔产值却比前一年减少了20％。合作化以后，强调了粮食柑桔必须同时发展，但是由于劳动力问题没有根本解决，柑桔和粮食生产的发展也受到了限制。
    公社化以后，对于柑桔和粮食生产的要求更高了。为了提高柑桔生产，要推行许多新技术、新措施，必须投放大量的劳动力；水稻生产要全面地贯彻执行农业八字宪法，也需要投放更多的劳动力；而且多种经营、社办工业等各项生产也需要劳动力。由于人民公社发挥了一大二公的作用，妥善地安排了劳动力，柑桔和粮食都取得了空前大丰收。
    公社为什么能够解决长期以来就存在的互争劳力的矛盾呢？
    一、公社化后，农村中普遍举办了集体福利事业，使全社二万五千多个妇女从锅灶旁走出来，成为一支农业战线上的生力军。1958年公社办起不久，男劳动力投入秋收冬种，全部妇女担负了采摘桔子的任务。今年早稻插秧的时候，妇女负责清园、剪枝、车水、拔秧等工作。公社化以前，妇女完成的工作量只占全部农活的10％左右，公社化以后，妇女完成的工作量就占全部农活的45％。
    二、公社化以后，全社劳动力可以在更大范围内统一安排和调度，比以前得到更合理更有效的使用。各生产队都按照男女整半劳力的特长，组成各种专业队。全社劳动效率提高50％左右，等于给公社增加了一半的劳动力。
    三、由于公社人多力量大，资金雄厚，有力量大规模地进行农田水利建设和购置各种农业机械。全社共修水库、开河、开塘三百六十六处，增加灌溉面积四万三千多亩，估计一年可以节省十九万多个劳动日。购买打稻机五百四十七部，插秧机三百九十五部，抽水机七十九台，共可节省二十九万个劳动日，也为农业机械化开辟了光辉的前景。
    四、全社有一万二千亩插花田，六千亩插花桔园，经过调整，可节省十五万个劳动日。
    上述四个方面，共可增加劳动日八百万个左右。以一个整劳动力全年做四百个劳动日计算，全社等于增加了二万个整劳动力。
    保证今年桔粮双丰收的另一个重要原因，是人民公社解决了桔粮争肥的矛盾。公社化以前，肥料不足，桔粮争肥矛盾很大。最近几年柑桔收入多，一般桔农总是把肥料先用到桔园里，因之水稻缺肥现象更为严重。春耕前桔子施“花前肥”，需要栏肥，早稻也要用栏肥作基肥。水稻就顾不到了。6、7月间桔子要施人粪，施化肥，这个时候晚稻也需要追肥，结果是“一碗饭二个人吃”，大家都吃不饱。柑桔采摘以后，要马上进行冬季施肥，这样冬种肥料就紧张了。公社化以后，这个矛盾怎样解决呢？公社认真贯彻执行了桔、粮、畜并重的方针，大力发展畜牧业，增积猪栏肥。从生产队、大队到公社都办了畜牧场，公养也带动了私养牲畜的大发展。由于畜牧业的发展，全社年产猪栏肥约二百二十五万担。同时，抽出了更多的人组成积肥专业队，大积土杂肥，大搞土化肥。公社化以来，全社共积了各种土杂肥二千二百九十二万担，制造了土化肥四千二百担，加上公社化后资金雄厚，商品肥也大大增加。肥料多了，桔粮争肥的矛盾也就基本解决了，而且施肥水平比过去有很大提高。据调查，全社水稻施肥量增加一倍二左右，柑桔施肥量增加一半。
    粮区变富　桔区更富
    这个公社多数是产桔区，桔子收入大，桔区经济富裕，因此产粮区的经济收入大大低于产桔区。公社化以后不到一年时间，这个情况就起了根本变化，产粮区由穷变富了，产桔区则更加富裕了。我们从下面两个生产队的变化中，可以略见一般。
    黄土岭生产队是个半山区，只种水稻。过去由于粮食产量不高，1957年还要国家供应粮食二万斤，1959年早稻产量比1958年增加了24.6％，除了留足口粮、种籽、饲料以外，还卖余粮十二万二千斤，供给兄弟生产队粮食五千一百斤、洋芋一万六千八百斤。这个队今年上半年的总收入达到四万四千三百三十九元，接近1958年全年总收入的水平。目前，除了还清银行贷款等二千三百元、基本建设投资三千多元、借给兄弟生产队一千五百多元以外，每户社员全年平均收入可以赶上产桔区富队的水平。
    另一个是产桔区的汇江生产队，过去就比较富裕，公社化以后变得更加富裕了。这个生产队在保证桔子增产的同时，大抓了粮食生产、畜牧业和多种经营，因此收入大大增加。今年与1958年相比，预计农业收入将增加一点二倍，柑桔收入将增加0.9％，畜牧收入将增加五点七倍，副业收入将增加三点九倍，全年总收入将增加39％左右。现在，这个队的社员家家有余粮，户户在银行有存款。
    澄江公社建立一年来的巨大变化，充分证明了人民公社有无比的优越性。
