Introduction to the "Liang Tou Wu" Pig Breed

Zhejiang Province has many relatively good local pig breeds, but the "Liang Tou Wu" in the Jinhua area is the most famous.

	"Liang Tou Wu" is one of China's well-known and excellent pig breeds. Its characteristics are: thin skin and fine bones, well-developed lean meat, thick fat, tender and delicious meat, short and fat limbs, and high slaughter rate. It is a superior raw material for curing ham and local Nanrou (preserved meat). The world-renowned "Jinhua Ham" is made from the hind legs of the "Liang Tou Wu."

	The "Liang Tou Wu" has beautiful fur, with black head and buttocks and snow-white middle; strong disease resistance, gentle temperament, and likes to raise piglets.

	"Liang Tou Wu" sows mature early, have strong reproductive capacity, high survival rate, and grow meat quickly. Sows can generally be bred and reproduced after six months of age, and can produce three litters of piglets in two years, with each litter producing about twelve piglets, and some as many as twenty or more. If well-fed, piglets can grow more than one jin of meat per day, reaching 120 jin after six months of feeding, and adult pigs can reach more than 300 jin. The average slaughter rate is 75% to 80%.

	Farmers in more than a dozen counties in the Jinhua area have always loved raising "Liang Tou Wu." At present, there are about 550,000 "Liang Tou Wu" pigs in stock in the Jinhua area, accounting for more than one-third of the total number of pigs; there are more than 100,000 "Liang Tou Wu" breeding pigs, also accounting for about one-third of the total number of breeding pigs.

    “两头乌”猪种介绍
    浙江省有很多比较好的本地猪种，但以金华地区的“两头乌”最为出名。
      “两头乌”是我国著名的优良猪种之一。它的特点是：皮薄骨细、精肉发达、脂肪较厚、肉嫩鲜美、四肢肥短、屠宰率高，是腌制火腿和家乡南肉的上等原料。国内外闻名的“金华火腿”就是用“两头乌”的后腿腌制的。
    “两头乌”毛色美观，头部和臀部全黑，中间雪白；抗病力强，性情温和，喜带小猪。
    “两头乌”母猪成熟期早，繁殖力强，成活率高，长肉较快。母猪一般养六个月就可配种繁殖，两年可产仔猪三窝，每窝产仔猪十二头左右，多的可达二十多头；如饲养得好，小猪每天可长肉一斤以上，饲养六个月可达一百二十斤，成年猪能达三百斤以上；屠宰率平均在75％到80％。
    金华专区十多个县的农民历来就爱养“两头乌”。现在金华地区存栏的“两头乌”共约五十五万头，占生猪总数三分之一以上；“两头乌”种猪共有十万多头，也占种猪总数的三分之一左右。
