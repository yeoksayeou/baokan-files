    A Batch of Machinery Factories Completes Annual Capital Construction Plan

    (From our newspaper) The vast number of workers in machinery industry capital construction, after opposing rightism, boosting morale, and working hard in August and September, have achieved tremendous accomplishments. By the end of September, thirteen units, including the Shanghai Pengpu Machine Factory, Changsha Water Pump Factory, Beijing Steam Turbine Generator Factory, Hefei Mining Machinery Factory, Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, Beijing Boiler Factory, Beijing Bearing Factory, Shaanxi Diesel Engine Factory, Yunnan Metallurgical Mining Machinery Factory, Xiangtan Wire Factory, Changsha Mining General Machinery Factory, Huashan Machinery Factory, and Yongding Machinery Factory, had overfulfilled their annual capital construction plans by one quarter. By early October, construction units such as the Tianjin Casting and Forging Plant and the Zhejiang Banshan Machinery Plant had also completed their annual capital construction plans ahead of schedule.

    These factories, under the correct leadership of Party committees at all levels, conscientiously examined and criticized right-leaning thoughts and slackening sentiments, launched vigorous mass movements, and made every effort to overcome difficulties, thus greatly accelerating the speed of construction.

    The soaring enthusiasm and selfless labor of all workers are important reasons why these units were able to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule. At the newly built Hefei Mining Machinery Factory in Anhui Province, from the factory director to all the workers, they worked tirelessly on the construction site day and night, regardless of the cold or heat and unafraid of difficulties. For the factory area road project of Shanghai Pengpu Machine Factory, when materials could not be transported in time, all the personnel of the capital construction section rushed to transport stones after work every day, and still insisted on working as usual the next day.

    Parties A, B, and C extensively carried out large-scale collaboration, with mutual support when one party faced difficulties. In order to help Party B overcome the shortage of installation manpower, the Hefei Mining Machinery Factory formed its own installation team; Party B took the initiative to help Party A adjust materials to ensure progress; Party C adopted the method of issuing drawings by project and by section to meet the construction needs as much as possible, and promptly solved design problems, effectively guaranteeing the great advance of construction progress.

    一批机械工厂完成全年基建计划
    本报讯　机械工业基本建设广大职工经过反右倾，鼓干劲，大干八、九月，取得了巨大成就。到9月底已有上海彭浦机器厂、长沙水泵厂、北京汽轮发电机厂、合肥矿山机器厂、北京第一机床厂、北京锅炉厂、北京轴承厂、陕西柴油机厂、云南冶金矿山机械厂、湘潭电线厂、长沙矿山通用机械厂、华山机械厂和永定机械厂等十三个单位提前一个季度超额完成了全年基本建设计划。到10月初又有天津铸锻件厂、浙江半山机械厂等建设单位，提前完成了全年基建计划。
    这些工厂在各级党委的正确领导下，认真检查和批判了右倾思想和松劲情绪，大搞群众运动，千方百计克服困难，因而建设速度大大加快。
    全体职工的冲天干劲和忘我的劳动热情，是这些单位能够提前完成今年计划的重要原因。安徽省新建的合肥矿山机器厂，从厂长到全体职工不避寒暑，不怕困难，日夜苦战在工地上。上海彭浦机器厂的厂区道路工程，当时材料不能及时运到，基建科全体人员每天下班后就赶运石子，次日照常坚持工作。
    甲乙丙三方广泛开展大协作，一方有困难，全体支援。合肥矿山机器厂为了帮助乙方克服安装力量的不足，自己组成了安装队；乙方则主动帮助甲方调剂材料，保证进度；丙方采取分项目、分部出图的办法，尽量满足施工需要，设计上有问题及时解决，有力地保证了施工进度的大大提前。
