    Enthusiastically Save, Benefit the Country and Oneself
    Soviet Union: Savings Institutions Established Everywhere in Urban and Rural Areas
    Czechoslovakia: People's Savings a Common Practice
    Bulgaria: Deposits Increased Several Times in Recent Years
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: In recent years, the national income of the Soviet Union has been continuously increasing. It has become a common habit for people to deposit their surplus money in banks. The amount of bank deposits has also been continuously increasing. In the Ukrainian Republic, one out of every four residents has a bank deposit. Residents of the Russian Federal Republic have deposited 3.65 billion rubles this year. The vast majority of deposits are made by workers and collective farm members. For example, one-third of the 1.38 billion rubles deposited in the Ukrainian Republic this year belongs to rural laborers. To facilitate savings for the broad masses, the government has vigorously developed savings offices in various cities and villages. The Russian Federal Republic alone has added 1,543 savings offices this year, and another 600 will be opened by the end of the year. The Ukrainian Republic has added more than 700 savings offices this year. Currently, there are 10,070 savings offices serving the working people of the Ukrainian Republic, 7,000 of which are in rural areas.
    Regular savings are not only beneficial to the country but also to oneself. People who deposited money in savings banks in the Russian Federal Republic received 1.3 billion rubles in interest last year. They widely used the money they accumulated to build houses and develop public utilities. For example, agricultural laborers in the Novo Nikolayevsky District of the Stalingrad Oblast used their savings to build more than 700 individual houses.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague: The president of the Czechoslovak State Savings Bank, Hes, recently told a reporter from this agency that in the first nine months of this year, the deposit amount of Czechoslovak residents increased by 2.5 billion crowns compared to the entire last year. He emphasized that this is a clear demonstration of the working people's enthusiastic support for socialist construction.
    Hes said that in recent years, the deposit amount of the Czechoslovak people has been continuously increasing, increasing by about 3 billion crowns each year, an average increase of more than 200 crowns per person. In 1958, the deposit amount of residents reached more than 11 billion crowns.
    He said that the Czechoslovak people attach great importance to thrift, and they have good saving habits. Almost every family has a bankbook, and society, schools, and families also educate children to cultivate saving habits from an early age.
    Hes also pointed out that the State Savings Bank has a dense savings network, distributed in cities, factories, and rural areas throughout the country. The savings bank goes deep into factories and rural areas to facilitate deposits for the working people, and is deeply welcomed by the masses. The State Savings Bank and mass organizations have also established "Savings Support Committees," with branches in various places, specializing in the promotion and publicity of thrift and savings.
    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, November 11: According to local newspaper reports, the Bulgarian people are saving very enthusiastically this year. In the first three quarters alone, residents deposited 954 million leva in new savings in banks, which is 4 million leva more than the total deposit amount for the entire year of 1958.
    Currently, among Bulgarian residents, there is an average of one deposit account for every one and a half people. By the end of September this year, the number of depositors in Bulgarian savings banks had increased by about three times compared to before the liberation in 1944, while the total deposit amount had increased fivefold.
    In the era of the people's government, the social composition of depositors has undergone fundamental changes. In the past, the vast majority of deposits belonged to capitalists; now, the depositors and savings amounts of workers, agricultural production cooperative members, and state employees account for 84% and 82% of the total number of depositors and total savings amount in the country.
    Savings are not only of great significance to national construction but also bring great benefits to depositors. From 1951 to 1958, the state paid a total of more than 500 million leva in interest to depositors, and this year, the interest will reach 170 million leva.

    踊跃储蓄  利国利己
    苏：城乡遍设储蓄机构
    捷：人民储蓄节约成风
    保：近年存款成倍增加
    新华社莫斯科电　近年来，苏联国民收入不断增加。人民将多余的钱存入银行已成为日常普遍的习惯。银行存款的数字也不断增加了。乌克兰共和国在每四个居民中就有一个人在银行存款。俄罗斯联邦共和国的居民今年已存入三十六亿五千万卢布。存款中绝大部分是工人、集体农庄庄员存入的。如乌克兰共和国今年存入的十三亿八千万卢布中就有三分之一的存款属于农村劳动者。为便利广大人民储蓄，政府在各个城市、乡村大力发展储蓄所。俄罗斯联邦共和国的储蓄所仅今年就增加了一千五百四十三个，到年底还将开办六百个。乌克兰共和国今年增加了七百多个储蓄所。目前为乌克兰共和国劳动人民服务的储蓄所就有一万零七千个，其中有七千个是在乡村。
    经常进行储蓄，不仅对国家有益，而且对自己也有利。俄罗斯联邦共和国去年存款的人从储蓄银行那里获得了十三亿卢布的利息。他们把积累起来的钱广泛用来建造房子，发展公共事业。例如斯大林格勒州的新尼古拉耶夫区的农业劳动者就利用自己的存款建设了七百多所个人住房。
    新华社布拉格电　捷克斯洛伐克国家储蓄银行行长赫斯最近对本社记者说，在今年头九个月中，捷克斯洛伐克居民存款额比去年全年增多了二十五亿克朗。他强调指出，这是劳动人民热情支援社会主义建设的明证。
    赫斯说，近年来，捷克斯洛伐克人民的存款额不断增加，每年增加约三十亿克朗，平均每人增加二百克朗以上。1958年，居民的存款额达到了一百一十多亿克朗。
    他说，捷克斯洛伐克人民很重视节约，他们有良好的储蓄习惯。几乎每个家庭都有银行存折，社会、学校和家庭也都教育儿童从小就培养储蓄的习惯。
    赫斯还指出，国家储蓄银行有一个稠密的储蓄网，分布在全国的城市、工厂和农村中。储蓄银行深入工厂、农村，便利劳动人民存款，深受群众的欢迎。国家储蓄银行和群众团体还成立了“支持储蓄委员会”，各地都设有分会，专门进行节约和储蓄的推广和宣传工作。
    新华社索非亚11日电　据此间报纸报道：今年来，保加利亚人民储蓄非常踊跃。仅在头三个季度里，居民新存入银行的储蓄款项就达九亿五千四百万列弗，比1958年全年存款总额还多四百万列弗。
    目前，在保加利亚居民中，平均一个半人就有一个存款户头。到今年9月底，保加利亚储蓄银行的存户比解放前1944年增加了约三倍，而存款总额则增加了五倍。
    在人民政权年代里，存款户的社会成分发生了根本的变化。过去存款的绝大部分属于资本家；而现在，工人、农业生产合作社社员和国家工作人员的存户和储蓄额，占全国存款户和储蓄总额的84％和82％。
    储蓄不但对国家建设有重大意义，同时也给存款户带来了巨大的好处。从1951年到1958年，国家支付给存户的利息共达五亿列弗以上，而今年，这项利息将达一亿七千万列弗。
