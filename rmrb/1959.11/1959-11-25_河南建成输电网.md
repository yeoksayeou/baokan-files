Henan Completes Power Grid

The 110,000-volt high-voltage power transmission line from Zhengzhou to Kaifeng was fully erected on the 21st and has already begun transmitting electricity from Zhengzhou to Kaifeng. From now on, the six cities in Henan Province centered on Zhengzhou, including Luoyang, Sanmenxia, Pingdingshan, Xinxiang, and Kaifeng, have been connected by high-voltage transmission lines to form a power grid. This power grid will play a huge role in regulating the power supply of the six cities and ensuring the continuous leap forward in production and construction.

The high-voltage transmission line from Zhengzhou to Kaifeng is 94.8 kilometers long, with a total of 425 concrete poles and iron towers along the line.

    河南建成输电网
    郑州至开封的十一万伏高压输电线在二十一日全部架通，并且已开始从郑州向开封送电。从此，河南省以郑州为中心的，包括洛阳、三门峡、平顶山、新乡、开封等的六个城市，已经由高压输电线联成为一个电力网。这个电力网，对于调剂六个城市的电力供应，保证生产建设的持续跃进，将发挥巨大作用。
    郑州至开封的高压输电线全长九十四点八公里，沿线共设混凝土电杆和铁塔四百二十五个。
