Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: The Ministry of Agriculture called for a rapid launch of a mass movement for winter livestock production centered on the mating of large livestock and the production of pigs, striving to increase the breeding rate of large livestock this year, complete and overfulfill this year's pig production plan, and make all preparations for the continued leap forward in livestock production next year. This was proposed by the Ministry of Agriculture at a national livestock production telephone conference held on the 9th.
	The conference analyzed the current thriving scene of national livestock production and then pointed out that livestock production is still a weak link in agricultural production. Agricultural departments in various regions must seize the current favorable situation, oppose right-leaning tendencies, and boost morale to quickly launch a large-scale winter mating and pig production upsurge.
	The conference pointed out that to ensure the completion of next year's large livestock breeding tasks, the key is to seize the mating work in this winter and next spring, especially to seize the favorable opportunity of good livestock condition in the first few months of the year to carry out winter mating and greatly increase the proportion of pregnant livestock. Various regions should also earnestly do a good job in winter livestock protection, conduct a general inspection of livestock protection for the winter, repair livestock pens, increase cold protection equipment, and store enough fodder. At the same time, special attention should be paid to protecting pregnant livestock and young livestock, and improving the survival rate of young livestock.
	In terms of pig production, the conference put forward the slogan of "Ensure that large pigs do not die, pregnant pigs do not abort, and all newborn piglets survive." At present, we must do a good job in cold protection, warmth preservation, and feeding management. In order to prepare for the great development of pig production next year, we must start now to earnestly do a good job in sow mating, eliminate empty pregnancies, select and retain a large number of sows, select and retain boars in proportion, expand breeding pig herds, carry out epidemic prevention work in winter, and carry out various basic construction tasks for pig raising, build large pig farms, and conduct rotational training for breeders and epidemic prevention personnel.
	The conference emphasized that an important measure to ensure the leap forward in animal husbandry is to effectively solve the feed problem. Especially in the autumn harvest distribution, various regions should reserve sufficient feed grain according to the principle of "quantifying by head, distributing to farms, using special grain for special purposes, and not misappropriating it."
	Finally, the conference requested that while vigorously grasping the production of large livestock and pigs, various regions should also grasp the production of sheep and poultry, and grasp the work of rabbit breeding and beekeeping.

    农业部号召抓好配种工作
    加快冬季牲畜繁殖
    据新华社11日讯　迅速开展一个以大牲畜配种和生猪生产为中心的冬季畜牧生产群众运动，力争提高今年大牲畜增殖率，完成和超额完成今年生猪生产计划，并为明年畜牧业生产继续跃进作好一切准备。这是农业部在9日召开的全国畜牧生产电话会议上提出来的。
    会议在分析了当前全国畜牧生产的一片欣欣向荣的景象之后，接着指出：畜牧生产目前仍然是农业生产中的一个薄弱环节。各地农业部门必须抓紧当前有利形势，反右倾、鼓干劲，迅速掀起一个大规模的冬季配种和生猪生产高潮。
    会议指出：要保证明年大牲畜增殖任务的完成，关键是抓紧今冬明春的配种工作，特别是要抓好年前几个月牲畜膘情好的有利时机，开展冬季配种，大大提高孕畜比例。各地还要切实做好冬季保畜工作，进行一次普遍的保畜过冬大检查，修补畜栏，增加防寒设备，贮足饲草。同时，要特别注意保护孕畜，保护幼畜，提高幼畜成活率。
    在生猪生产方面，会议提出“保证大猪不死亡，孕猪不流产，新生仔猪全部成活”的口号。在目前要作好防寒保暖和饲养管理工作。为了给明年生猪大发展作好准备，从现在起必须切实做好母猪配种、消灭空孕，大量选留母猪、按比例选留公猪、扩大繁殖猪群，在冬季开展防疫工作，并要进行养猪的各项基本建设工作，大建猪场，轮训饲养员和防疫员。
    会议强调指出：保证畜牧业跃进的重要措施，是切实解决饲料问题。尤其在秋收分配中，各地要根据“按头定量，分配到场，专粮专用，不得挪用”的原则，留足饲料粮食。
    最后，会议要求各地在大抓大牲畜和生猪生产的同时，还要抓好羊子、家禽的生产，抓好养兔、养蜂的工作。
