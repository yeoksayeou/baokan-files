Establish Benchmarks, Launch Competitions, Catch Up with the Advanced
Xihu Commune Averages More Than One Pig Per Mu

According to Hangzhou Daily news: Xihu People's Commune in Hangzhou actively implements the agricultural production policy of "taking grain as the key link, combining grain and livestock, comprehensive development, and overall balance." While achieving bumper harvests in rice and tea, it has also actively developed pig production, achieving great results. From January to now, it has raised a total of 10,495 pigs. The commune has 3,473 mu of tea land and 1,989 mu of paddy fields, averaging 1.9 pigs per mu. The current stock is more than 5,000 heads, averaging more than one pig per mu. In the past ten months, it has sold more than 4,000 head of fat pigs to the state. Due to the great development of pig production, more than 52,475,000 jin of pig manure has been accumulated, saving 30,000 yuan in funds for buying commercial fertilizer, promoting the development of agricultural production and increasing the income of commune members.

In the past, except for the Nanshan team, members of the Xihu People's Commune had no habit of raising pigs. After the people's commune was established last year, the commune party committee actively developed animal husbandry, requiring an average of one pig per mu. At that time, it was opposed by a few people who said that there was a shortage of labor, not enough feed, a lack of pigpen equipment, and it could not be done. The commune party committee seized on the advanced facts of the Nanshan team's pig raising, and criticized this right-leaning conservative thought. The Nanshan team correctly implemented the policy of combining collective and household raising, actively developed the collective raising portion, self-reliantly bred piglets, tried every means to obtain green fodder, built pig houses locally and simply, and did a good job in disease prevention. Last year, the team averaged 4.4 pigs per person, becoming a red banner for pig raising in the country. The commune party committee held an on-site meeting in the Nanshan team, summarized and promoted their advanced experience, and launched a mass movement to learn from Nanshan, catch up with Nanshan, and surpass Nanshan in pig raising.

After the upsurge in pig production, collective and household pig raising in the whole commune has greatly developed. However, a few wealthy peasants spread the fallacy of "losing money" by raising pigs, saying that there was no benefit in raising pigs and that selling them to the state would result in losses. The commune party committee summarized the materials of the October Production Team and thoroughly criticized the "loss-making theory." Due to the large number of pigs raised by the October team, the pig-raising income from January to August this year was 29,610 yuan, and it also accumulated 5.4 million jin of fertilizer. Due to sufficient fertilizer, this year's tea harvest was unprecedented. They also sold 575 fat pigs to the state. Subsequently, the whole commune further launched a fall breeding upsurge, and all 780-plus sows in the commune were mated, and the number of pigs increased significantly.

The important experiences of Xihu People's Commune in developing pig production are as follows:

First, the party committee secretary took command and established an animal husbandry leading group, correctly implementing the policy of combining collective and household raising. In management, a responsibility system of contracting work points, output, feed, and cost, as well as rewards and compensation, was established. The commune actively developed the collective breeding sector and established 48 livestock farms. Some of the collectively owned pork pigs were distributed to commune members for raising, and the commune gave reasonable labor remuneration. At the same time, household raising by commune members was encouraged, and the production team provided a certain amount of feed based on the number of pigs raised.

Second, great efforts were made to cultivate sows to achieve self-breeding and self-raising. Hot mating, frequent mating, double mating, and repeated mating were adopted to ensure that every sow was pregnant, every fetus was highly productive, and every piglet survived. The survival rate of piglets reached 96%, ensuring the supply of piglets.

Third, every effort was made to obtain green silage to solve the difficulty of insufficient feed. Feed was grown on water, feed was planted on land, and feed was collected on mountains. Each team established a feed professional team, making full use of idle land to grow feed crops such as banana roots, sweet potatoes, and Zhejiang University radishes. Water hyacinth and revolutionary grass were grown extensively by utilizing the edges of West Lake, mountain ponds, and ditches. Semi-laborers were mobilized to collect various wild vegetables and grasses that could be used as feed on the mountains. Since the beginning of this year, the whole commune has produced 14 million jin of green fodder, accounting for about 70% of the pigs' feed.

Fourth, pig pens were built simply and disease prevention and protection work was done well. A responsibility system for various disease prevention measures was established, and the commune also trained eleven veterinarians among the members. This year, swine fever, erysipelas, lung plague, and other diseases have been basically eliminated.

Currently, the commune party committee is summarizing the experience of developing pig production and mobilizing the masses to formulate a plan for continued leap forward next year.

    树立标兵　发动竞赛　追赶先进
    西湖公社每亩有猪一头多
    据杭州日报消息　杭州市西湖人民公社积极贯彻“以粮为纲，粮畜并举，全面发展，综合平衡”的农业生产方针，在水稻、茶叶大丰收的同时，积极发展生猪生产，取得了很大成绩。从1月份到现在，共养了一万零四百九十五头猪，全社三千四百七十三亩茶地和一千九百八十九亩水稻，平均每亩地有一点九头。现有存栏五千多头，平均每亩地有一头多。十个月来，共出售给国家肥猪四千多头。由于生猪大发展，共积了猪肥五千二百四十七万五千多斤，节省了三万元买商品肥料的资金，促进了农业生产的发展，增加了社员的收入。
    西湖人民公社除南山队外，过去社员没有养猪习惯。去年人民公社化后，公社党委积极发展畜牧生产，要求每亩地平均有一头猪。当时曾遭到少数人的反对，说劳动力紧张，饲料不够，造猪栏设备缺乏，办不到。公社党委就抓住南山队养猪的先进事实，批判了这种右倾保守思想。南山队正确地贯彻集体饲养和社员家庭饲养同时并举的方针，积极发展集体饲养部分，自力更生繁殖猪仔，千方百计搞青饲料，就地取材、因陋就简造猪舍，做好防病疫工作，去年平均每人养猪四点四头，成为全国养猪的一面红旗。公社党委就在南山队召开现场会议，总结推广他们的先进经验，并大搞群众运动，掀起了学南山、赶南山、超南山的养猪竞赛。
    生猪生产高潮掀起后，全社集体饲养和社员家庭饲养生猪有了很大的发展。但是少数富裕农民又发出了养猪“吃亏”的谬论，说养猪没有好处，卖给国家要赔本。公社党委就总结十月生产队的材料，彻底批判了“吃亏论”。十月队由于生猪养得多，今年1至8月份养猪收入二万九千六百一十元，而且还积了五百四十万斤肥料。由于肥料足，今年茶叶获得了空前大丰收。他们还出售给国家五百七十五只肥猪。接着，全社进一步掀起了秋季满怀的繁殖高潮，全社七百八十多头母猪全部交配上，生猪头数又有很大的增加。
    西湖人民公社发展生猪生产的重要经验如下：
    第一，党委书记挂帅，成立畜牧领导小组，正确贯彻执行集体饲养和社员家庭饲养并举的方针。在管理上建立包工分、包产量、包饲料、包成本和奖励、赔偿的责任制度。公社积极发展集体饲养部分，办了四十八个畜牧场。一部分集体所有的肉猪分配给社员饲养，公社给予合理的劳动报酬。同时鼓励社员家庭饲养，生产队根据养猪多少给予一定的饲料。
    第二，大抓母猪培育，实现自繁自养。采取热配、勤配、双重配和重复配，做到只只满怀，胎胎高产，头头成活。小猪成活率达到96％，保证了仔猪的供应。
    第三，千方百计搞青贮饲料，解决饲料不足的困难。水上养饲料，地上种饲料，山上采饲料，各队建立饲料专业队，充分利用空闲地大种蕉藕、番薯、浙大萝卜等饲料作物。利用西湖角边、山塘河沟大养水浮莲、革命草。发动半劳动力上山采集各种能作饲料的野菜、野草。全社今年以来搞了一千四百万斤青饲料，占猪的饲料70％左右。
    第四，因陋就简造猪舍，做好防病保护工作。建立各种防病疫的责任制，公社还在社员中培养了十一名兽医。今年基本上消灭了猪瘟、丹毒、肺疫等病害。
    目前，公社党委正在总结发展生猪生产经验，并且发动群众制订明年继续跃进的规划。
