Xiangtan Builds Highway Bridge

The largest highway bridge in Hunan Province—the Xiangtan Bridge in Xiangtan City—has recently started construction. The Xiangtan Bridge is a nine-pier, eight-span, hollow-arch reinforced concrete bridge, 597 meters long and 17 meters wide, capable of carrying four heavy-duty vehicles side by side.

Once this bridge is completed, it will connect the east and west sides of Xiangtan City into a single unit.

    湘潭修建公路桥
    湖南省最大的一座公路桥——湘潭市湘潭大桥在最近动工兴建。湘潭大桥是一座九墩八孔、空腹拱型钢筋混凝土结构的桥梁，全长五百九十七米、宽十七米，可并行四部载重汽车。
    这座大桥建成以后，就可使湘潭市东西联成一气。
