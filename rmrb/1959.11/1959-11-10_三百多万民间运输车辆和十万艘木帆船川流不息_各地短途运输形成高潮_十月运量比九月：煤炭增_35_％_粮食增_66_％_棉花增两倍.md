Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: A mass movement of short-distance transportation has formed a climax in various regions across the country. On the water and land transportation lines of various regions, 3.5 million various civilian transport vehicles and nearly 100,000 wooden sailing boats are busily shuttling back and forth. The national local transportation freight volume in October created the highest record of monthly transport volume in history, exceeding November of 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward which had the largest transport volume, by 21.4%. The transport volume of major materials such as steel, coal, metallic ores, grain, and cotton have all increased significantly compared to September. Among these, cotton increased by twofold, grain increased by 66%, and coal increased by 35.7%.

The call issued by the National Short-Distance Transportation Broadcast Conference on October 27th, "Use more transportation to ensure high yield, transport as much as is produced, transport immediately after production, seize every second, and leave no ounce behind," has stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses in various regions to participate in transportation. In Henan Province, an average of over 400,000 people participated in transportation from October 21st to 27th, and this number had increased to over 700,000 people by November 3rd; in Sichuan Province, the number of people participating in transportation also increased from over 500,000 to over 1.1 million.

Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, many regions, while carrying out short-distance transportation with concentrated efforts, have vigorously carried out transportation construction work such as road construction, vehicle manufacturing, river dredging, and shipbuilding, and have established transportation teams for the People's Communes, fundamentally improving transportation conditions. By the end of October, Shanxi Province had repaired over 3,000 roads, with a total length of over 25,000 kilometers. In Hunan Province, over 10,000 professional and sideline transportation teams have been organized.

Since the launch of the national mass movement for short-distance transportation, many new experiences have been created. Hebei Province has started by focusing on transportation for factories, mines, and rural areas, strengthening and consolidating the strength of short-distance transportation. This province first thoroughly investigated the transportation conditions and transportation strength of factories and mines, and adopted a combination of fixed vehicles and unified dispatching to fix over 580 vehicles and over 7,000 civilian transport vehicles for over 60 factories and mines throughout the province. For some factories and mines that could not fix their transportation capacity, the transportation department organized professional vehicles and transportation cooperatives to contract for transportation and implement unified dispatching. This approach, adapting to the characteristics of factories and mines that have large transportation tasks, urgent requirements, and relatively concentrated materials, basically met the transportation requirements of factory and mine production. For rural transportation tasks, the method of establishing stations along the line and organizing forces to transport in sections was adopted. For example, goods for long-distance transportation were transported to the station by professional transportation tools, i.e., by transportation cooperatives; goods for short-distance transportation were picked up and delivered by the People's Communes themselves. This approach, adapting to the characteristics of the dispersed transportation bases in rural areas, fully utilized the favorable conditions of the abundant rural transportation force in Hebei Province. The San Shengyu People's Commune in Nong'an County, Jilin Province, has also gained new experience in consolidating the work of running transportation by the People's Communes. This commune first focused on establishing a management system for the commune's transportation stations; secondly, it established organizations to serve transportation, such as cart inns, veterinary stations, horseshoeing shops, and vehicle repair departments, to solve specific problems such as livestock feed. At the same time, in accordance with the principle of "payment according to work and exchange of equal value," it resolved issues such as the reasonable distribution of freight revenue.

    三百多万民间运输车辆和十万艘木帆船川流不息
    各地短途运输形成高潮
    十月运量比九月：煤炭增35％　粮食增66％　棉花增两倍
    据新华社9日讯　短途运输群众运动已经在全国各地形成高潮。在各地水陆运输线上，三百五十万辆各种民间运输车辆和近十万艘木帆船，正在奔忙不息。10月份全国地方交通货运量，创造了历年来月度运输量的最高纪录，比大跃进的1958年运量最大的11月份，还多21.4％。钢铁、煤炭、金属矿石、粮食、棉花等主要物资的运量，都比9月份增加很多。其中棉花增加了两倍，粮食增加了66％，煤炭增加了35.7％。
    10月27日全国短途运输广播大会发出的“以多运保高产，产多少运多少，随产随运，分秒必争，斤两不留”的号召，激发了各地群众参加运输的热情。河南省在10月21日到27日平均有四十多万人参加运输，11月3日已经增加到七十多万人；四川省参加运输的人，也由五十多万增加到了一百一十多万。
    在各级党委的领导下，许多地区在开展突击性的短途运输的同时，大力进行修路造车、浚河造船等交通建设工作，建立人民公社的运输队伍，从根本上改善交通条件。山西省到10月底已经整修了三千多条道路，总长达二万五千多公里。湖南省组织起来的专业和副业运输队已达一万个以上。
    全国短途运输群众运动开展以来，创造了很多新的经验。河北省从抓厂矿和农村运输入手，增强并巩固了短途运输的力量。这个省对厂矿的交通条件和运输力量，首先摸清底细，采取固定车辆与统一调度相结合的办法，为全省六十多个厂矿固定了五百八十余辆汽车和七千多辆民间运输车辆。有些不能固定运力的厂矿，由运输部门组织专业汽车和运输合作社包干承运，并实行统一调度。这样做，适应了厂矿运输任务大、要求急、物资比较集中的特点，基本上满足了厂矿生产的运输要求。对农村运输任务，采取沿线建立站点的办法，分片组织力量运输，如长距离运输的货物，由专业运输工具即由运输合作社运送到站；短距离运输的货物，由人民公社自取自送。这样做，适应了农村运输据点分散的特点，并把河北省农村运输力量充沛的有利条件充分利用起来。吉林省农安县三盛玉人民公社对于巩固人民公社办运输的工作，也取得了新的经验。这个公社首先抓紧建立了公社交通运输站的管理制度；其次，建立大车店、兽医站、挂掌铺（钉牲口蹄掌）、修车部等为运输服务的组织，解决了牲口饲料等等具体问题。同时根据“按劳付酬，等价交换”的原则，解决运费收益合理分配等问题。
