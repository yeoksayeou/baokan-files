Since the State Council issued its directive on deeply mobilizing the masses to extensively collect and fully utilize wild plant materials, for more than a month, thanks to the attention and leadership of Party committees at all levels, a massive "minor autumn harvest" movement has emerged nationwide. The collection and utilization of wild fibers, wild starches, wild oilseeds, wild tannin extracts, wild medicinal herbs, wild miscellaneous fruits, mountain products, and other resources have increased unprecedentedly across the country.

The purpose of collecting and purchasing wild plants is to fully utilize these abundant wild resources. Therefore, while carrying out the collection and purchasing campaign, a mass movement to process and utilize wild plants must also be launched, turning wild grass into treasure and ensuring that the harvested wild plants serve production and construction as quickly as possible. If we only pay attention to collection and purchasing without focusing on processing and utilization, the wild plants in hand will not be able to play their role. Wuzhai County in Shanxi Province immediately processed the miscellaneous wood and rattan collected during the "minor autumn harvest" into more than one million various handles, small farm tools, and woven products to support the rural water conservancy construction and manure accumulation campaigns. Pengshui County in Sichuan Province vigorously promoted collection and purchasing and helped communes establish more than 500 small wineries, capable of brewing 800,000 jin of liquor. Zhong County established more than 2,000 seasonal and year-round wild plant processing factories. These practices are very timely and necessary.

The processing and utilization of wild plants must be timely. Many fresh wild plants are extremely susceptible to mold and deterioration. Without processing, losses will occur. Wild plants such as acorns and small oilseeds have high moisture content and will quickly mold and germinate if they are not promptly shelled, sliced, crushed, and pressed for oil. Some aromatic raw materials will lose or reduce their use value if they are not quickly distilled and extracted after collection. Wild fibers cannot be used for linen spinning without degumming. If tannin raw materials are not processed and used in a timely manner, the tannins they contain will disappear, and their use value will decrease. Many wild plants are bulky and lightweight; without processing to reduce their volume, transportation becomes inconvenient. In addition, processing can increase the output value of wild plant raw materials by one or even several times, increasing accumulation for communes and income for members.

What principles should be adopted for the processing and utilization of wild plants? First, the processing of wild plant raw materials should be closely integrated with agricultural production. Through the diversified operations of communes, preparations should be made for large-scale sideline production in winter and the spring plowing campaign next spring, in order to increase agricultural output value, increase the income of communes and members, and thus promote the further development of production in the people's communes. At present, a vigorous mass movement for water conservancy construction and manure accumulation is being carried out in rural areas. This is an important foundation for continued agricultural leap forward next year. The processing of wild plants should be closely integrated with this movement, and various tools, ropes, woven products, and other items made from wild plants should be put into the water conservancy construction and manure accumulation movement in a timely manner. Second, the processing of wild plants should be closely integrated with industrial construction, increasing industrial raw materials and actively supporting industrial production. For example, the textile industry currently needs to increase a large amount of linen raw materials. When processing wild fibers, every effort should be made to degum the fibers that can replace linen, making them suitable for the textile industry. The paper industry needs a large amount of fiber raw materials to increase paper production. Wild plant processing should process grass fibers suitable for papermaking into pulp or beat them into cardboard to meet the needs of the paper industry. Currently, industrial production requires a large amount of alcohol, so various regions should process wild starch into white liquor or extract alcohol to meet industrial needs. Third, processing wild raw materials should also serve exports, increase export sources, and exchange for more materials urgently needed for national construction to support the continued leap forward of the national economy. Fourth, wild plant processing should also strive to increase market supply and expand the supply of consumer goods for people's lives. For example, process wild plant raw materials into daily sundries, daily furniture, cultural supplies, etc. Processing wild medicinal materials into finished or semi-finished products can meet the needs of medical and health care and serve people's health. In short, the collected wild plant raw materials must be used in a planned and step-by-step manner in the places where the state and the market are most urgently needed.

Wild plant resources are extremely abundant and extremely dispersed. Generally speaking, they are not suitable for centralized processing in one place. Except for the portion that must be directly supplied to large-scale industries as raw materials, most should be processed by the people's communes. The primary processing of agricultural and sideline products, including wild plant raw materials, is one of the important production contents of commune industry. Vigorously developing the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products will expand the commodity production of the people's communes, increase the production of more industrial raw materials, export materials, and consumer materials for the state and the market, and make the commune-run industry and the state-owned large-scale industry more closely connected, promoting each other and developing together. Commune-run industries must make full use of local resources, taking local materials and processing them locally, in order to achieve rapid development. The extremely rich wild plant raw materials scattered in various places are an inexhaustible, readily available source of raw materials for commune-run industries. Guizhou Province is expected to collect 1 billion jin of acorns this year. If all of them are used for winemaking, they can be used for the year-round production of thousands of small wineries. This year's bumper harvest of wild plants has created favorable conditions for the development of commune-run industries. In fact, only when the wild plant processing industry run by the communes has more and faster development can all useful wild plant raw material resources be more fully utilized.

In order to better develop the commune industry and make full use of wild plant resources, the industrial and commercial departments in various regions should adopt a positive attitude of support, help the communes to make future plans, and also set up some demonstrative processing plants in some areas where plant materials are concentrated, as bases for teaching technology and promoting experience, and helping commune-run factories train a group of processing technicians. Wild plant raw materials, in addition to the raw materials needed by large-scale industries, must first meet the needs of large-scale industries. The people's communes must actively build simple and small processing plants. Commercial departments should supply the commune industry with various equipment and tools as much as possible, help them improve operating techniques, and reduce costs. In the initial stage of the processing plant and during the trial use of certain wild plants, there may be lower product quality and higher costs, but experience has shown that as long as they are continuously helped to innovate operating techniques and improve business management, these shortcomings will be quickly overcome. Commercial departments should actively purchase newly produced finished and semi-finished products from the commune-run industries, sign production and sales contracts with the communes, guarantee the sales of processed products, and enable the commune-run industries to obtain reasonable profits, in order to encourage the confidence of the communes in running industries and to develop and strengthen the commune-run industries.

Doing a good job in the processing and utilization of wild plants, like doing a good job in the collection and purchase of wild plants, must adhere to putting politics in command and carrying out mass movements under the leadership of the Party. Only in this way can wild plants be used in industrial and agricultural production and people's lives in a fast, good, and economical way, and can we win the complete and final victory of the "minor autumn harvest" movement.

    赶快加工利用野生植物
    自从国务院发布关于深入发动群众广泛采集和充分利用野生植物原料的指示后，一个多月以来，由于各级党委的重视和领导，一个声势浩大的“小秋收”运动高潮已在全国范围内出现。全国各地野生纤维、野生淀粉、野生油料、野生栲胶原料、野生药材、野生杂果、山货等采集和利用的数量空前地增加了。
    采集、收购野生植物的目的是要把这些丰富的野生资源充分地利用起来，所以在开展采集、收购运动的同时，还必须开展一个加工利用野生植物的群众性运动，变野草为财宝，让丰收的野生植物，尽快地为生产建设服务。如果我们只注意采集收购，而不注意加工利用，那末拿到手的野生植物，也不能发挥作用。山西省五寨县把在“小秋收”运动中采集到的杂木、藤条立即加工成各种柄把、小农具和编织品等一百多万件，支援了农村兴修水利和积肥运动；四川省彭水县大抓采集、收购，并且帮助公社办起小酒厂五百多个，能酿酒八十万斤；忠县建起了季节性和常年性的野生植物加工厂二千多个，这些作法都是非常适时的，必要的。
    对野生植物的加工利用必须及时。许多新鲜的野生植物极容易霉烂变质，不经过加工处理就会造成损失，橡子、小油料等野生植物水分较大，不及时脱壳、切片、破碎、榨油，很快就会霉烂和发芽。有些芳香原料采集后不很快蒸馏提制，就会减少甚至失去使用价值。野生纤维不经过脱胶就不能用于麻纺。栲胶原料如不及时加工使用，其中包含的单宁就会消失，使用价值也就降低。许多野生植物，量大体轻，不经过加工缩小体积就不便于运输。此外，经过加工还可以一倍乃至数倍地提高野生植物原料的产值，给公社增加更多的积累，给社员增加更多的收入。
    野生植物的加工利用应当采取什么方针呢？首先，野生植物原料的加工，应当同农业生产密切结合，通过公社的多种经营，为冬季大搞副业生产和明春的春耕运动作好准备，以提高农业产值，增加公社和社员的收入，从而促进人民公社生产的进一步发展。目前，农村正在开展轰轰烈烈的群众性的兴修水利和积肥运动。这是明年农业继续跃进的重要基础，野生植物的加工应当密切结合这一运动，把利用野生植物制成的各种工具、绳索、编制品等及时投入兴修水利和积肥运动中去。其次，野生植物加工要同工业建设密切结合，增加工业原料，积极地支援工业生产。比如目前纺织工业需要增加大量的麻纺原料，在加工野生纤维的时候，应当千方百计地把能够代替麻的纤维进行脱胶，使之成为纺织工业用麻。造纸工业需要大量的纤维原料增产纸张，野生植物加工就要把可用于造纸的草类纤维加工成纸浆或打成纸板，供应造纸工业生产的需要。目前工业生产需要大量的酒精，各地就应当用野生淀粉加工成白酒或提制酒精，以满足工业的需要。第三，加工野生原料，还应当为出口服务，增加出口货源，以换回更多的国家建设所迫切需要的物资，支援国民经济的继续跃进。第四，野生植物加工，还应当努力为增加市场货源服务，扩大对人民生活消费品的供应。例如，把野生植物原料加工成日用杂品、日用家具、文化用品等。把野生药材加工成成品或半成品，可以供应医药卫生的需要，为人民健康服务。总之，必须有计划、有步骤地把采集到的野生植物原料用到国家和市场最迫切需要的地方去。
    野生植物资源是极其丰富而又极其分散的，一般地说不宜于集中一个地方进行加工。除了必须直接供大工业作原料的部分外，大部分应当依靠人民公社进行加工。包括野生植物原料在内的农副产品的初制加工是公社工业的重要生产内容之一。大力发展农副产品的加工工业，将扩大人民公社的商品性生产，给国家和市场增产更多的工业原料、出口物资和消费资料，使社办工业和国营大型工业更加紧密地衔接起来，互相促进，共同发展。社办工业必须充分利用地方资源，就地取材，就地加工，才能得到飞速的发展。分散在各地的极其丰富的野生植物原料，正是社办工业取之不尽、用之不竭、近在咫尺的原料来源。贵州省今年预计可以采集到橡子十亿斤，如全部用来酿酒，可供几千个小型酒厂长年生产之用。今年野生植物的大丰收，为公社经营的工业的发展创造了有利的条件。事实上，只有公社经营的野生植物加工工业有了更多、更快的发展，才能更充分地利用一切有用的野生植物原料资源。
    为了更好地发展公社工业，充分利用野生植物资源，各地工业部门、商业部门应当采取积极扶持的态度，帮助公社作出今后的规划，并且还可以在某些植物原料集中的地方兴办一些示范性的加工厂，作为传授技术、推广经验的基地，帮助社办工厂培养、训练一批加工技术人员等等。野生植物原料，除了大工业所需的原料必须尽先满足大工业的需要之外，人民公社要积极兴办简易的、小型的加工厂。商业部门应当尽可能供应公社工业各种设备和工具，帮助它们改进操作技术，降低成本。在加工厂初建阶段和某些野生植物试用期间，可能发生产品质量较低、成本较高的现象，但是，经验证明，只要不断帮助他们革新操作技术和改善经营管理，这些缺点一定会很快得到克服。商业部门应当积极收购社办工业新生产的成品和半成品，跟公社订立产销合同，保证加工产品的销路，使公社工业得到合理的收益，以鼓励公社办工业的信心和发展壮大公社工业。
    作好野生植物加工利用工作，像作好野生植物的收集和收购工作一样，必须在党的领导下坚持政治挂帅、大搞群众运动。只有这样，才能多快好省地把野生植物及时利用到工农业生产和人民生活中去，才能夺取“小秋收”运动全部的最后的胜利。
