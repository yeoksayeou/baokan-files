Wielding the "Ant Array" to Conquer the "Fortress Cluster"
Wang Genhai, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Branch of Shanghai Construction Machinery Factory

Our Shanghai Construction Machinery Factory is a small factory with small factory buildings and outdated equipment. 80% of the factory's eighty machine tools have been in use for two or three decades, and one sixteen-foot lathe has been in use for eighty-four years, longer than the age of the oldest worker.

In 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, our factory underwent a major innovation in production technology. This innovation was called "Ants Gnawing at Bones." At the end of June last year, the factory received its first urgent task of processing two sets of ten-ton converter heavy equipment, including two castings weighing ten tons each and more than ten feet long and wide. Such large pieces could not even fit through the factory gate. The factory workers were not daunted by the difficulties, and displayed a communist spirit of daring to think, speak, and act. They designed and manufactured a simple double-headed native machine tool themselves, and processed it like ants crawling around the workpiece, thus completing the task two days ahead of schedule. This experience was valued by the Municipal Party Committee, which further clarified our direction, adhered to the spirit of self-reliance and the processing method of "Ants Gnawing at Bones." As a result, production increased tenfold last year.

Based on the Great Leap Forward last year, at the beginning of this year, all the factory workers enthusiastically responded to the call of the Municipal Party Committee to continue to exert great effort and continue to make a big revolution in technology. They further developed the processing method of "Ants Gnawing at Bones." They completed the task of two sets of 650mm rolling mill main engines in advance in four and a half months, and completed the production tasks of more than 1,150 tons of important equipment such as rolling mills and converters in nine months. From January to September, the output value plan was completed by 135.95%, an increase of more than doubled compared with the same period last year, the labor productivity of workers increased by 60% compared with the same period last year, the quality qualification rate reached 99.58%, and the profits turned over to the state increased by more than doubled compared with the same period last year.

How did we further develop the "Ants Gnawing at Bones" processing method on the basis of last year?

This year, the tasks assigned to us by the state are heavier and the requirements are higher than last year. For example, most of the parts for thirteen sets of fertilizer equipment with an annual output of 2,000 tons and thirteen sets of ten-ton converter tilting equipment weigh about two or three tons. In particular, the two sets of 650mm rolling mills produced in the first half of the year weighed 240 tons, and the twelve frames weighed ten and a half tons each, more than ten feet high and eight feet wide, standing like a pailou. Many of our experienced masters had never processed such large pieces, and had never even seen them. The tasks were very urgent and the technical requirements were very complex. Obviously, it would be difficult to complete such tasks with the original outdated equipment. The actual working hours also differed greatly from the required working hours. For example, according to the production tasks in the third quarter, more than 210,000 working hours were required, but the total working hours of auxiliary workers, apprentices and production workers in the factory was only 107,000 working hours.

Faced with this situation, some people complained that the task was too heavy; but the vast majority of workers believed that "we cannot be called by difficulties" and "we cannot reach out to the higher authorities." Under the leadership of the Party organization, the workers launched a heated debate. Finally, all the workers in the factory unanimously stated that they should make do with whatever was available, rely on their own efforts, and use the method of making a big revolution in technology to overcome the difficulties.

As a result, a upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution was set off throughout the factory. The workers worked hard overnight, and in response to the needs of product processing, they made six "ant" heads to gnaw at the machine frame, and the first step was to overcome the equipment and technical barriers in processing the rolling mill frame. It took fifty-nine days to make a machine frame.

It seems that the equipment problem has been solved, but after careful calculation, if we process one machine frame in two months, then it will take two years for twelve machine frames. All the workers in the factory launched a heated discussion again, concentrating their wisdom to encircle and suppress the speed barrier. By summarizing the method of processing the first machine frame, they further used their brains, found tricks, and everyone contributed ideas and suggestions. Some people advocated that one ant was too slow, wouldn't it be faster if several ants worked together? Others said that since this is the case, why not use several groups of ants to gnaw at several machine frames at the same time, wouldn't that be faster? The factory leaders concentrated the wisdom of the masses and developed the processing method of "Ants Gnawing at Bones" created in the Great Leap Forward last year. They changed a "ant" to "gnaw" one by one, into several "ants" attacking in groups from top, bottom, left, right, front, and back. The strength of the whole factory was organized, and dozens of ants attacked four machine frames at the same time. This greatly accelerated the processing speed of the machine frame, from fifty-nine days for the first one to thirty days, twenty days, and finally to seventeen days. The processing task of twelve machine frames was completed in four and a half months. Now, whenever a new product is launched, a large group of "ants" are dispatched. We used the method of "deploying the ant array" to conquer the bunker groups (large parts). Some workers jokingly said: "Now 'ants' are not gnawing at bones, they are simply swallowing bones." Indeed, the workers changed many "ant" heads from special to general purpose, manual feeding to automatic feeding, single-edge cutting to multi-edge and multi-blade and whirlwind cutting. An "ant" installed several teeth (several knives) on its mouth, and when cutting, iron filings fell like snowflakes, realizing high output, high quality, and high efficiency. Facts have proved that the processing method of "deploying the ant array" is in line with the spirit of the General Line and the policy of "walking on two legs." It added wings to the small factory and realized the Great Leap Forward.

These "flying ants" with wings can be moved at will according to the needs of the processing workpiece.

This method of processing is faster than using a large planer. Xinhua News Agency reporter Xia Daoling, Zhang Ping photo

    大摆“蚂蚁阵”　攻克“堡垒群”
    中共上海建设机器厂支部书记　王根海
    我们上海建设机器厂，是一家厂房狭小、设备陈旧的小厂。全厂八十台机床中80％已经用了二、三十年，其中一台一丈六尺的大车床已经用了八十四年，比最老的工人的年龄还要大得多。
    1958年在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，我们厂在生产技术方面来了个大革新。这革新叫“蚂蚁啃骨头”。去年6月底，厂里第一次接到加工两套十吨转炉的重型设备的紧急任务，其中有两只铸件重达十吨，长阔各一丈多，这样的大件，连厂门也进不去。全厂工人并没有被困难吓倒，发扬了敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，自己设计，自己制造成一台结构极为简单的双头土机床，像蚂蚁一样爬在工作物周围加工，从而提前两天完成了任务。这一经验得到市委的重视，使我们进一步明确了发展方向，坚持了自力更生的精神和“蚂蚁啃骨头”的加工方法，去年的生产因此增长了十倍。
    在去年大跃进的基础上，今年一开始，全厂职工就热烈响应了市委继续鼓足干劲，继续大闹技术革命的号召，进一步发展了“蚂蚁啃骨头”的加工方法，以四个半月的时间提前完成了二套六百五十毫米轧钢机主机的任务，并在九个月时间内完成了一千一百五十余吨的轧机和转炉等重要设备的生产任务。1至9月份，产值计划完成了135.95％，比去年同期增长了一倍多，工人劳动生产率比去年同期增长了60％，质量合格率达到99.58％，上缴利润比去年同期增长了二倍多。
    我们是怎样在去年的基础上进一步发展了“蚂蚁啃骨头”的加工方法呢？
    今年，国家交给我们的任务比去年更重，要求也更高。例如，十三套年产二千吨的化肥设备和十三套十吨转炉倾动设备的部件，绝大部分的重量都在二、三吨左右。特别是上半年生产的两套六百五十毫米轧钢机，主机重达二百四十吨，十二只机架每只重达十吨半，高一丈多，宽八尺，立起来像只牌楼。这样的大件，我们许多老师傅不但从来没有加工过，甚至连看都没有看见过。而任务又十分紧急，技术要求也很复杂。很显然，利用原有陈旧的设备，要完成这样的任务是有困难的。实际工时也和需要工时相差很大。如第三季度按生产任务计算，需要工时二十一万多，可是全厂把辅助工人、学徒和生产工人的工时统统加在一起，只不过十万零七千个工时。
    面对这种情况，有的人嫌任务太重了；但是绝大多数的工人认为：“不能叫困难”，“也不能向上级伸手”。在党组织的领导下，职工们展开了激烈的辩论。最后，全厂职工一致表示，要因陋就简，自力更生，用大闹技术革命的办法来克服困难。
    于是，全厂兴起了一个大搞技术革新、技术革命的热潮。工人们连夜突击，针对产品加工需要，制成六只“蚂蚁”头，大啃机架，第一步攻下了加工轧钢机架的设备关、技术关，前后花了五十九天的时间制成了一只机架。
    看来设备问题似乎解决了，但是仔细一算，如果按照两个月加工一只机架来算，那末十二只机架就要两年时间。全厂职工又开展了热烈的讨论，集中智慧围攻速度关。通过总结第一台机架加工的方法，进一步动脑筋，找窍门，人人献妙计，个个提建议。有人主张一只蚂蚁太慢了，几只蚂蚁一起，不是就快了吗？也有人说，既然如此，何不用几群蚂蚁对几只机架一齐啃，那不是更快吗？工厂领导人员集中群众智慧，把去年大跃进中创造的“蚂蚁啃骨头”的加工方法发展一步，将一只“蚂蚁”一道道“啃”，变成几只“蚂蚁”上、下、左、右、前、后成群结队地围攻。全厂的力量组织起来，用几十只蚂蚁同时围攻四只机架。这样，大大加快了机架加工速度，从第一只的五十九天压缩到三十天，二十天，最后到十七天。四个半月就完成了十二只机架的加工任务。现在，每逢一项新产品上马，都有一大群一大群的“蚂蚁”出动。我们就运用了“大摆蚂蚁阵”的办法，攻克了碉堡群（大部件）。有些工人风趣地说：“现在‘蚂蚁’不是啃骨头，简直是在吞骨头了。”确实如此，工人们把许多“蚂蚁”头从专用改为通用，人力进刀改为自动进刀，单刀切削改为多刀多刃以及旋风切削，一只“蚂蚁”嘴上装了几只牙齿（几把刀），切削起来，铁屑像雪片一样纷纷落下来，实现了高产、优质、高效率。事实证明，“大摆蚂蚁阵”的加工方法，符合总路线的精神，符合“两条腿走路”的方针。它为小厂添了翅膀，实现了大跃进。
