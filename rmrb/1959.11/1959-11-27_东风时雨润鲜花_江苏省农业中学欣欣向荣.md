The spring breeze and timely rain nourish fresh flowers
    ——The Flourishing Agricultural Middle Schools of Jiangsu Province
    Cheng Zhuoru, Sun Shuiguan, Xu Wen
In Jiangsu Province, whether in the water towns of Jiangnan, along the banks of the Huai River, on the shores of Hongze Lake, or on the beaches of the Yellow Sea, agricultural middle schools, a new type of secondary school in our country, are everywhere. If people visit agricultural middle schools in the rural areas of Jiangsu, the farmers will proudly point to the outstanding and spacious houses in the area, telling guests that they are "their own schools."

          New Type of School, New Atmosphere
    Agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province have now taken a big step forward, entering a new stage. With the continuous consolidation of the people's communes, the comprehensive development of production, and the urgent need in rural areas to cultivate a large number of talents for mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, electrification, and other construction, over two thousand agricultural middle schools in the province have absorbed more than 100,000 recent graduates of higher primary schools in the second half of this year. The number of students enrolled has reached more than 230,000. Originally, most agricultural middle schools had only one grade, but now they generally have both first and second grades. Some schools also have third grades and have universally added courses such as algebra, physics, and chemistry. In addition, fifty agricultural middle schools have established high school classes, with over 1,300 high school students. In the first half of the year, the Party committees at all levels strengthened leadership over the few agricultural middle schools that were not doing well, mobilizing the masses to help solve problems in areas such as school buildings, production bases, and the arrangement of teaching and labor time. These schools are catching up quickly, rapidly changing their appearance, and some have even caught up with advanced agricultural middle schools. Since the spring of this year, agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province have begun to strive to achieve self-sufficiency in production. As of recently, nearly eight hundred agricultural middle schools in the province have achieved full or partial self-sufficiency.

    Agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province adhere to the system of part-work and part-study, with students' learning and labor time generally accounting for about half each. Most schools follow a half-day system, with half a day for learning and half a day for labor; a few schools follow an alternate-day system, with one day for learning and one day for labor. This arrangement of labor and teaching time strengthens the connection between teaching and practice. The duration of study in both junior and senior agricultural middle schools is three years. After graduation, the vast majority of students will stay in the people's communes as technicians or take on other jobs, based on the needs of the people's communes. A small number of students will advance to higher-level schools for further study.

    Agricultural middle schools have received the love and welcome of the broad masses of the people, who call them "their own schools" with the most affectionate words, saying that agricultural middle schools are the "golden keys" to opening the treasure mountain and transporting talents for the construction of a new socialist countryside. They cheer "Well done, well done!" and sing praises to the Party and Chairman Mao: "In March, the spring breeze blows, blowing open the peach blossoms all over the trees. Thanks to the benefactor, the Communist Party, for establishing agricultural middle schools at the entrance of our hometowns."

          Achieving Success in Both Learning and Production
    Agricultural middle schools are part-work and part-study schools, and this system creates extremely favorable conditions for combining education with productive labor. Students are students in the classroom, and new-type farmers in the fields. Teaching is closely integrated with practice, and the teaching of theoretical knowledge is closely combined with practical application, which is very effective in improving the quality of students' knowledge. Teachers at Ba灶 Agricultural Middle School in Dongtai County, who teach agricultural knowledge, often take students to the fields for lessons. When teaching about cotton pruning, they take the students to the fields to identify male and female branches, and then explain why and how to prune the male branches. Some schools teach the basic knowledge of field management for soybeans and corn in class, and then immediately go to the soybean and corn fields for practical operation. Students say that they will never forget the knowledge they learn in this way! Students also apply the method of combining theory with practice in their studies. After learning the methods of calculating various shapes, they immediately apply them to calculating fertilizer piles and earthwork. Because students' learning is closely integrated with production practice, the vocabulary in their compositions is also enriched.

    The curriculum of agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province includes: cultural courses, including the most basic courses of full-time middle schools, such as politics, language, mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc.; and technical courses, including agricultural knowledge (agricultural high schools have botany, crop cultivation, etc.). Because a comprehensive and appropriate arrangement is made for teaching, production, and rest, the courses can be completed within the prescribed time. The educational quality of the main courses in agricultural middle schools is no lower than that of ordinary full-time middle schools in the area, and the performance of some agricultural middle school students is even better than that of full-time middle school students.

    Productive labor is an important activity in agricultural middle schools. Agricultural middle schools in various parts of Jiangsu carry out various forms of productive labor in accordance with the comprehensive management requirements of the people's communes for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and in accordance with the needs of the communes to train intermediate and junior technicians in agricultural mechanization and electrification. Now, general agricultural middle schools have fixed production bases and have established farms, livestock farms, various handicraft workshops, and small factories. Some agricultural middle schools also have their own orchards, tea gardens, forest farms, and so on. Schools in various places appropriately arrange students' labor according to their age and gender, generally having older students participate in agricultural labor, younger students participate in handicraft production, male students undertake heavier labor, and female students mostly raise poultry and livestock. Some heavy labor that agricultural middle school students cannot handle is resolved by the school and the production team through labor exchange. This reasonable arrangement not only gives every student the opportunity to participate in labor and receive training, but also benefits the students' health and physical and mental development. Because agricultural middle schools use advanced technical measures and are willing to humbly ask experienced farmers for advice, coupled with the soaring enthusiasm of teachers and students, many high-yield fields have emerged in agricultural middle schools in various places. Thanks to good production, teachers and students in many agricultural middle schools are now entirely eating the vegetables they grow themselves, and they can also partially supply their own grain. Some teachers and students in agricultural middle schools have already eaten the melons and fruits they grow themselves and the fresh fish they raise themselves.

    Students in agricultural middle schools study and work at the same time, learning in labor and laboring in learning, both learning cultural and scientific knowledge and receiving labor training, and learning production skills. The students cultivated in this way are new-type intellectuals who are capable of both literary and military skills. In the words of the masses praising agricultural middle schools, they are: "Children of farming families enter agricultural middle schools, achieving success in both learning and production," and "Agricultural middle schools have good rules, and part-work and part-study produces new people."

        A Fresh Force for Technological Innovation
    Agricultural middle schools have satisfied the educational aspirations of higher primary school graduates, promoted the development of cultural and educational undertakings, and are increasingly demonstrating a significant role in developing agricultural production and prospering rural culture. People say that agricultural middle schools are "four-satisfied" schools, satisfying the state, the communes, the students, and the parents.

    With the establishment of agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province, higher primary school graduates who could not enter full-time middle schools now have the opportunity to continue their education. In this way, the state can also confidently popularize primary education and develop secondary and higher education undertakings. Agricultural middle schools save the state a lot of expenses and reduce the financial burden on students' parents. It is understood that a student in a public junior middle school requires about 500 yuan of state expenditure for education over three years. Based on the current number of more than 200,000 agricultural middle school students in Jiangsu, this can save the state 130 million yuan. In addition, because agricultural middle schools engage in part-work and part-study, their production income can gradually achieve self-sufficiency in students' learning and living expenses, teachers' salaries, and administrative expenses, and parents will not have to bear any expenses for their children.

    Agricultural middle schools are also a great force in carrying out rural propaganda activities and enlivening rural cultural life. According to statistics from Nantong County, during the communization and socialist propaganda and education movement, agricultural middle schools posted more than 48,000 propaganda slogans, participated in writing wall slogans more than 20,000 times, painted more than 10,000 murals, built nearly 200 "Leap Forward" gates, and participated in propaganda in the fields and construction sites more than 50,000 times, educating more than 210,000 people. Agricultural middle schools are praised by the masses as "political propaganda and agitation stations," and agricultural middle school students are called "political agitation and propaganda workers."

    Agricultural middle schools have become bases for the promotion of technology in rural areas and a new force for agricultural technological innovation. When people's communes implement important technical measures, they often first make a model in the agricultural middle school, and then hold an on-site meeting in the agricultural middle school to promote it comprehensively. During the autumn plowing and sowing, the experimental fields of Hezheng Agricultural Middle School in Rugao County first conducted deep plowing and sowing experiments, and the wheat seedlings emerged completely in accordance with the specifications. The commune Party committee not only held an on-site meeting here, but also organized agricultural middle school students into technical guidance groups to go deep into various production teams to help impart operational techniques.

    Yonggan Agricultural Middle School in Rugao County has launched a scientific research activity of "100 Mu of 100 Experimental Fields." They conduct experiments on all kinds of crops planted by the commune. In their fields, they have successively conducted various experiments such as the cultivation of seedless melons and fruits, grafting sweet potatoes with sunflowers, and hybrid corn breeding. Many of their successful practices have been widely spread throughout the county. Shuanglou Agricultural Middle School in Hai'an County conducted detailed research and comparative experiments on the entire process of wheat growth, dividing it into 177 areas according to 12 items such as varieties, fertilizer ratios, and deep plowing, and compiled a textbook on wheat cultivation techniques, providing valuable data for agricultural scientific research.

    Agricultural middle schools in various parts of Jiangsu also directly participate in the scientific and technological activities of commune production. Anzhen Agricultural Middle School in Wuxi County, entrusted by the commune Party committee, organized more than 50 students to conduct a soil survey of more than 30,000 mu of land in the whole commune, and drew a soil distribution map of the whole commune, providing important scientific data for improving soil, rational irrigation, fertilization, and crop layout. Zhongtang Agricultural Middle School of Hetou Commune in Jintan County established scientific experimental service stations for hydrology, meteorology, and farmland water conservancy. During the flood season, it issued timely and accurate water situation forecasts and hydrological forecasts every day, and helped the county conduct a hydrological survey of the whole county.

    In the movement for agricultural tool reform and technological innovation, teachers and students of Rugao County agricultural middle schools have modified more than 30 new-style tools. The teachers and students of Xiayuan Agricultural Middle School successfully made a ten-row strip seeder. Teachers and students of Yonggan Agricultural Middle School created and invented a foot-powered traction plow in the deep plowing movement, increasing work efficiency fourfold.

    Agricultural middle schools undertake the task of transferring construction talents to various communes. Changjiang Agricultural Middle School in Jiangning County has trained 22 tractor drivers for the commune in one year of operation. Agricultural middle schools throughout the province will train a large number of middle and junior technicians and management cadres for the people's communes within five to ten years.

            The Party's Leadership over Agricultural Middle Schools
    Party committees at all levels in Jiangsu Province are very concerned about the development and growth of agricultural middle schools, and pay close attention to improving the political and ideological level of teachers. As early as March of last year, the Provincial Party Committee held a symposium on agricultural middle schools, summarizing and promoting the school-running experiences of Shuanglou Township and Shiqiao Township, clearly put forward the relevant guidelines for running agricultural middle schools well, and clarified the nature and tasks of agricultural middle schools. After the schools were established, the Provincial Party Committee closely focused on consolidation work. Comrade Chen Guang, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, personally went to Ligang, Xishiqiao and other agricultural middle schools in Jiangyin for inspection, and deeply understood the consolidation situation and existing problems of agricultural middle schools. Local Party committees often make political reports to teachers, organize teachers to participate in political studies, and also adopt various methods to improve their teaching level. Teachers in agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province come from various fields. Some are previous high school graduates, some are educated youth from society, and some are transferred cadres. The vast majority of them are young people who have never done educational work before and lack teaching experience. In response to this situation, the local Party committees vigorously promoted the linkage between teachers in agricultural middle schools and teachers in ordinary middle schools, and mobilized teachers in agricultural middle schools to attend classes in nearby ordinary middle schools. Not long after the establishment of agricultural middle schools, higher normal colleges and universities throughout the province successively held correspondence courses and compiled reference materials for language and mathematics teaching for agricultural middle school teachers to use as teaching references. Nanjing Normal College and Jiangsu Education Institute jointly established a correspondence department and published "Correspondence Communication" for language and mathematics teachers in agricultural middle schools to systematically help teachers in agricultural middle schools improve their teaching level in language and mathematics. The cultural and educational departments in various places also helped teachers in agricultural middle schools establish teaching and research groups on a commune basis, conduct collective lesson preparation by subject on a regular basis according to the teaching characteristics of agricultural middle schools, exchange teaching experience, and study and discuss teaching work.

    Jiangsu Province adopted the simultaneous approach of on-the-job study and off-the-job intensive training for the training and improvement of teachers in agricultural middle schools. In addition to short-term intensive training conducted by various counties and special districts during summer vacation and busy farming seasons, the Provincial Party Committee held a refresher school for agricultural middle school teachers this summer, absorbing more than 1,000 agricultural middle school teachers to participate in refresher studies. The Provincial Education Department drew many outstanding teachers from various higher education institutions to serve as teaching staff for the refresher school. In order to meet the needs of the development of agricultural middle schools and prepare teachers for the development of agricultural high schools next year, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Education Department entrusted various normal colleges and universities to run agricultural high school teacher training classes, selecting agricultural middle school teachers with better political and physical conditions and excellent academic performance to continue their studies in the teacher training classes.

    The commune Party committee strengthened its leadership over agricultural middle schools, appointing a leading cadre to serve concurrently as principal, and equipped them with experienced full-time cadres and part-time teachers. Many commune Party secretaries, chairmen, and CYL cadres lectured on political courses at agricultural middle schools and planted experimental fields with teachers and students of agricultural middle schools. Local Party committees strengthened political and ideological work in agricultural middle schools, earnestly educating young students to establish great ambitions, boost great enthusiasm, love schools, study hard, work actively, and be progressive students; and encouraged young teachers to be red in agricultural middle schools and specialized in agricultural middle schools. If agricultural middle schools did not have enough school buildings, the people's communes would let them use public houses or help them build houses. To ensure that agricultural middle schools gradually achieve self-sufficiency in production, the commune Party committee included the agricultural middle school's self-sufficiency plan into the commune's unified plan, dispatched experienced old farmers to serve as production guidance, and helped agricultural middle schools solve problems such as land, draught cattle, large agricultural implements and other means of production, helping them develop diversified management, and arranging raw materials and sales channels. Local commune Party committees also helped agricultural middle schools establish CYL and Young Pioneer organizations, strengthening regular political and ideological work through the CYL and Young Pioneer organizations. Under the leadership and help of Party committees at all levels, agricultural middle schools rapidly grew stronger, and the teachers' political consciousness and teaching ability continued to improve. Now, many teachers in agricultural middle schools have become excellent CYL members, and some have become Communist Party members. The students in agricultural middle schools have further established the idea of taking the school as their home, formed a good atmosphere of studying hard and diligently, and have high labor enthusiasm, presenting a vigorous and energetic new atmosphere.

          Thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao
    Agricultural middle schools are becoming more and more consolidated and better, and everyone supports and agrees with them. The broad masses of commune members are filled with joy and sing praises of agricultural middle schools and the Communist Party:

    New school is set up in the commune,
    Children have middle school to attend.
    The part-work and part-study system is good,
    They are strong in both literary and military skills.
    Study and labor leap forward together,
    There are ways to achieve self-sufficiency in production.
    Students and parents are all satisfied,
    Grateful to the Communist Party with one heart.

    Agricultural middle schools in various parts of Jiangsu Province have developed, consolidated, and grown in struggle. In the past, it has shown its vitality and its important role. In the future, with the forward development of agricultural production, it will further demonstrate its powerful strength.

    东风时雨润鲜花
    ——江苏省农业中学欣欣向荣
    程灼如　孙水观　徐文
    在江苏省，不管是在江南水乡，还是在淮河两岸，不管是在洪泽湖畔，还是在黄海滩头，到处有着我国新型的中等学校——农业中学。人们如果到江苏的农村访问农业中学，农民们会自豪地指着当地出色、宽敞的房屋，告诉客人，那就是他们“自己的学校”。
          新型学校新气象
    江苏省农业中学，现在又向前跨进了一大步，进入了一个新的阶段。在人民公社不断巩固，生产全面发展，农村迫切需要培养大量的机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化等建设人才的情况下，全省二千多所农业中学，今年下半年又吸收了十万多名应届高小毕业生。在校学生达二十三万多人，农业中学原来大多数只有一个年级，而现在普遍有了一、二两个年级。有的学校还有三年级并且普遍增开了代数、物理、化学等课程。还有五十所农业中学办了高中班，高中学生一千三百多人。过去少数办得不大好的农业中学，上半年各级党委加强了领导，发动群众帮助解决了校舍、生产基地、教学与劳动时间的安排等方面的问题，这一类学校，急起直追，迅速改变了面貌，有的已赶上了先进的农业中学。今春以来，江苏省的农业中学都开始为实现生产自给而努力。到最近为止，全省已有近八百所农业中学实现了全部自给或部分自给。
    江苏省的农业中学坚持着半耕半读的制度，学生的学习和劳动时间，大体上各占一半。多数学校是半天学习，半天劳动的半日制；也有少数学校是一天学习，一天劳动的隔日制。这样安排劳动和教学时间，加强了教学和实践的联系。农业中学的初中和高中的学习期限都是三年。学生毕业以后，根据人民公社的需要，绝大部分人将留在人民公社当技术员或担任其它工作，少数人将升入高一级的学校继续深造。
    农业中学得到了广大人民群众的热爱和欢迎，他们用最亲热的字眼，称呼农业中学是“自己的学校”，说农业中学是打开宝山为建设社会主义新农村输送人才的“金钥匙”。他们欢呼“办得对，办得好”。歌颂党和毛主席：“三月里来吹春风，吹开桃花满树红。感谢恩人共产党，家乡门口办农中。”
          学习生产两头红
    农业中学是半耕半读的学校，半耕半读为教育与生产劳动相结合创造了极为有利的条件。学生在课堂上是学生，在田头就是新型的农民。教学密切结合实际，讲授理论知识和实际应用紧密结合，对提高学生的知识质量效果很好。东台县包灶农业中学讲农业知识课的教师经常带学生到田头上课。在讲棉花整枝一课时，把学生带到田头识别公枝和母枝，而后讲解为什么要打公枝和如何打公枝。有些学校在课上讲了有关大豆、玉米田间管理的基本知识，接着就到大豆、玉米田里实际操作，学生反映，这样学到的知识一辈子忘不了！学生学习也运用理论结合实际的方法。他们学过各种形体的计算方法以后，就立即在算肥堆和算土方中运用起来。由于学生的学习紧密结合生产实践，学生作文的语汇也丰富了。
    江苏省各地农业中学的课程是：文化课程包括全日制中学最基本的几门课程，如政治、语文、数学、物理、化学等，技术课程有农业知识（农业高中则有植物学、作物栽培学等）。由于对教学、生产、休息作了全面、妥善的安排，所学的功课在规定的时间内都能学完。农业中学的几门主要课程，教育质量不低于当地一般的全日制中学，有一部分农业中学学生的成绩，比全日制中学学生的成绩还要好些。
    生产劳动是农业中学的重要活动内容。江苏各地农业中学根据人民公社农林牧副渔综合经营的要求，根据为公社培养农业机械化、电气化的中级和初级技术人员的需要，因地制宜地进行了各种生产劳动。现在一般的农业中学都有了固定的生产基地，办有农场、畜牧场、各种手工业工场和小型的工厂，有些农业中学还拥有自己的果园、茶园、林场，等等。各地学校根据学生的年龄和性别等特点，适当地安排了学生的劳动，一般是年龄大的参加农业劳动，年龄小的参加手工业生产，男学生担负较重的劳动，女学生多是饲养家禽家畜。有一些农业中学学生不能胜任的重劳动，由学校和生产队用换工的办法解决。这样合理安排，既使每一个学生都有参加劳动、受到锻炼的机会，又有利于学生的健康和身心的发展。由于农业中学运用先进的技术措施，肯虚心向老农请教，再加上教师、学生们的冲天干劲，各地农业中学里出现了不少高额丰产田。由于生产搞得好，许多农业中学的教师和学生已经全部吃自己种的蔬菜，粮食也部分可以自给，有些农业中学的教师和学生已经吃到自己栽种的瓜果和自己饲养的鲜鱼。
    农业中学的学生就是这样一面读书，一面劳动，在学习中劳动，在劳动中学习，既学到文化科学知识，又受到劳动锻炼，学到生产本领。这样培养出来的学生是能文能武的新型知识分子，拿群众赞扬农业中学的话来说，就是：“农家子弟进农中、学习生产两头红”“农业中学好章程、半耕半读出新人”。
        技术革新的生力军
    农业中学满足了高小毕业生的升学要求，促进了文化教育事业的发展，对发展农业生产和繁荣农村文化也越来越显示了重大作用。人们说农业中学是“四满意”的学校，国家、公社、学生、家长都满意。
    江苏省创办了农业中学，原来不能进入全日制中学的高小毕业生，都有了升学的机会。这样国家也就可以放手普及小学教育，放手发展中等教育和高等教育事业。农业中学节省了国家大量开支，又减轻学生家长的经济负担。据了解一个公办初中的学生，三年要国家支出教育经费五百元左右，以江苏现有的二十多万农业中学学生计算，就可为国家节省一亿三千万元。另外由于农业中学进行半耕半读，他们生产上的收益，可以逐步实现学生学习、生活费用，教师工资，行政经费的三自给，家长将不用负担学生的任何费用。
    在开展农村宣传活动、活跃农村文化生活方面，农业中学也是一支很大的力量。据南通县统计，在公社化及社会主义宣传教育运动中，农业中学共贴宣传标语四万八千多张，参加写墙头标语的有二万多人次，绘制壁画一万多幅，扎跃进门近二百座，参加田头、工地宣传的有五万多人次，受到教育的群众有二十一万多人次。农业中学被群众誉为“政治宣传鼓动站”，农业中学的学生被称为“政治鼓动宣传员”。
    农业中学在农村中成为技术推广的基地，是农业技术革新的一支新生力量。人民公社在贯彻重要技术措施的时候，往往先在农业中学做出样子，而后在农业中学召开现场会，进行全面推广。秋耕秋种中，如皋县何正农业中学的试验田里，首先进行了深耕播种试验，麦苗出土完全合乎规格要求，公社党委不仅在这里召开了现场会，并且把农业中学学生编成技术指导组，深入各个生产队，帮助传授操作技术。
    如皋县勇敢农业中学开展了“百亩百项试验田”的科学研究活动。他们根据公社所种植的各种作物，样样都进行试验。在他们的田园里，曾经先后进行过无子瓜果的培植，用日光花嫁接山芋，玉米杂交育种等各种试验。他们许多成功的做法，已在全县广泛传播。海安县双楼农业中学在三麦生长的全部过程中，按品种、施肥比例、深翻等十二个项目，分一百七十七个地区，进行了细致的研究和对比试验，编出了一本三麦栽培技术教材，对农业科学的研究，提供了一些有价值的资料。
    江苏各地农业中学，还直接参加了公社生产的科学技术活动。无锡县安镇农业中学受公社党委的委托，组织了五十多个学生，对全社三万多亩土地进行了土壤普查，并绘制了全社土壤分布图，为改良土壤、合理灌溉、施肥、作物布局等方面提供了重要的科学资料。金坛县河头公社中塘农业中学建立了水文、气象、农田水利等科学试验服务站。在汛期，每天及时、准确地发出水情预报和水文预报，并帮助县内进行了全县的水文调查。
    在农具改革、技术革新运动中，如皋县农业中学师生改制的新式工具有三十多件。下原农业中学的师生制成功十行条播机。勇敢农业中学的师生们，在深翻土地运动中，创造发明脚踏牵引犁，工效提高四倍。
    农业中学担负起向各个公社输送建设人才的任务。江宁县长江农业中学办学一年，已经为公社培养了二十二名拖拉机手。全省农业中学在五年到十年内，将为人民公社培养出大量的中、初级技术员和管理干部。
            党对农业中学的领导
    江苏省各级党委十分关怀农业中学的发展和成长，十分注意和关怀教师们政治思想水平的提高。早在去年3月，省委召开了农业中学座谈会，总结和推广了双楼乡、施桥乡的办学经验，明确提出有关办好农业中学的方针，阐明了农业中学的性质和任务。学校办起来以后，省委又紧抓巩固工作。省委书记陈光同志亲自到江阴利港、西石桥等农业中学进行视察，深入了解农业中学的巩固情况和存在的问题。各地党委经常向教师作政治报告，组织教师参加政治学习，还采取了多种多样的方法，提高他们的教学水平。江苏省农业中学教师，是来自各个方面的，他们中有往届的高中毕业生，有社会上的知识青年，还有下放干部。他们绝大多数都是青年人，过去没有做过教育工作，缺乏教学经验。针对这个情况，各地党委大力提倡农业中学同普通中学的教师挂钩，动员农业中学的教师到附近的普通中学去听课。在农业中学刚创办不久，全省各地的高等师范院校先后举办函授，编印了语文和数学教学的参考资料，供农业中学教师作教学参考。南京师范学院和江苏教育学院联合成立了函授部，分别出版农业中学语文、数学教师“函授通讯”，系统地帮助农业中学教师提高语文和数学的教学水平。各地的文教部门还帮助农业中学教师以公社为单位，成立教研组，根据农业中学的教学特点，定期分科进行集体备课，交流教学经验，研究讨论教学工作。
    江苏省对农业中学教师的培养和提高工作，是采用在职学习和离职集训同时并进的。除了各县、各专区在暑假、忙假期间分别进行短期集训外，今年暑期，省委举办了农业中学教师进修学校，吸收了农中教师一千多人参加进修学习，省教育厅从各个高等院校抽调了许多优秀教师担任进修学校的教学工作。为了适应农业中学发展的需要，为明年发展农业高中准备师资力量，江苏省委和省教育厅委托各师范院校举办了农业高中师资训练班，选拔政治、身体条件较好的、学业成绩优秀的农中教师，进师资训练班继续深造。
    公社党委加强对农业中学的领导，指定一个主要干部兼任校长，配备了较有办学经验的专职干部和兼职教师。很多公社的党委书记、社长和团委干部，到农业中学讲政治课，同农业中学的教师、学生合种试验田。各地党委加强了对农业中学的政治思想工作，谆谆教育青年学生，立大志，鼓大劲，热爱学校，努力学习，积极劳动，做个进步学生；鼓励青年教师，红在农中、专在农中。农业中学校舍不够，人民公社就让公房给他们，或者帮助他们盖房子。农业中学要逐步实行生产自给，公社党委就把农业中学的生产自给规划纳入公社的统一规划之中，调派有经验的老农担任生产指导工作，给农业中学解决土地、耕牛、大型农具等生产资料，帮助开展多种经营，安排原材料和销路等等。各地公社党委还帮助农业中学建立了共青团和少先队的组织，通过团、队组织，加强经常的政治思想工作，在各级党委的领导和帮助下，农业中学迅速壮大起来，教师的政治觉悟和教学能力不断提高。现在，农业中学的许多教师已成为优秀的共青团员，有些已成为共产党员。农中的学生进一步树立了以校为家的思想，形成了认真读书、刻苦学习的风气，劳动热情高涨，呈现着朝气蓬勃的新气象。
          感谢党和毛主席
    农业中学愈办愈巩固，越办越好，人人拥护，个个赞成。广大的社员充满了喜悦的心情歌颂农业中学，歌颂共产党：
    社里办起新学堂，　孩儿有了中学上。
    半耕半读章程好，　能文能武本领强。
    学习、劳动齐跃进　生产自给有办法。
    学生、家长都满意　一心感谢共产党。
    江苏省各地农业中学，在斗争中发展、巩固、成长起来了。过去，它已显示了它的生命力和它的重大作用，今后，随着农业生产的向前发展，将进一步显示出它强大的力量。
