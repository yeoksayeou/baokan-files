Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, November 1st. Comrade Tan Zhenlin, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, spoke today at the inauguration ceremony of the Luoyang First Tractor Manufacturing Plant.

    Tan Zhenlin said: "Today, just one month after the tenth anniversary of the founding of our country, the Luoyang First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, a modern plant with an annual output of 15,000 54-horsepower 'Dongfanghong' brand diesel tractors, is holding a grand inauguration ceremony here. It is a first-class factory in our country, with the latest technology and equipment, and a large scale. It symbolizes the brilliant achievements of our country's industrial construction in the ten years since its founding. Its completion and commissioning is a victorious beginning for our country to advance along the road of agricultural modernization in the next ten years. Our farmers have long hoped for the great era of 'no need for cattle to plow the fields, no need for oil to light the lamps,' and it has begun to arrive. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's call to accelerate the modernization of agriculture in our country has put forward an extremely glorious task for the workers of the tractor plant. The First Tractor Manufacturing Plant is a backbone factory for realizing agricultural technical transformation on a national scale. It will send a constant stream of tractors into the vast fields of the motherland, replacing yellow cattle for plowing, yellow cattle for drawing water, and yellow cattle for pulling carts. Today, 500 million farmers across the country are celebrating the birth of this factory with joy and gratitude, and sincerely thank the builders of this factory."

    Tan Zhenlin said: "The Luoyang Tractor Manufacturing Plant is one of the key factories that the Soviet Union has assisted our country in building. The government of the Soviet Federal Republic and the Soviet people have not only assisted our country's construction with complete sets of equipment, but also sent their own excellent technical experts to our country to assist our construction. The completion of this factory symbolizes the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples and proves the superiority of the socialist system. This is a great joyous event in the technical transformation of agriculture in our country. Therefore, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the People's Republic of China, I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to all the workers! I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government! I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to the hard-working Soviet expert comrades!"

    He said: "Although the construction of the Luoyang Tractor Manufacturing Plant has taken four years, all the main projects were completed in two years, namely 1956 and 1958. 1956 was the year when our country's socialist construction found a path of great leap forward; 1958 was the year when our country's socialist construction launched a great leap forward. The construction history of this factory once again proves that the Party's general line for socialist construction and the great leap forward in socialist construction are completely correct. If you don't believe it, please see: the heart project of this factory—the engine workshop—was built in thirty-eight working days. This is a large factory building of 22,500 square meters; the factory building of the fuel system workshop of 12,870 square meters was completed in thirty-three days. Such a large factory building usually takes half a year or a year to complete, but we completed it in just over a month. Such a leap forward in construction speed is unprecedented in the history of construction projects in our country. We should pay tribute to our heroes on the capital construction front. In the process of building our factory, some admirable heroic figures emerged, such as a construction engineering team that built the exterior of a large factory building in thirty-eight days with the hard work of only two hundred and fifty workers; and another team that built the exterior of a large factory building in thirty-two days with even fewer workers. I believe that the heroic deeds of such heroic figures will spread throughout the country and blossom and bear fruit on construction sites across the country, greatly accelerating the speed of socialist construction in our country."

    Tan Zhenlin said: "Under the call of 'building, trial-producing, and producing at the same time,' all the workers, under the leadership of the Party, brought into play their revolutionary spirit, and promoted the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. They not only basically mastered the production and operation technology, and were able to smoothly complete the assembly line production, but also manufactured their own equipment. 97% of the non-standard equipment and 20% of the standard equipment were manufactured by themselves, and they directly participated in the installation and civil engineering, saving capital construction investment.

    "These achievements are inseparable from the active efforts of the workers, and are inseparable from the exemplary actions of heroes such as Yao Changyou, Dai Ershen, Fu Guangyao, and Zheng Jinyu. Yao Changyou's group's thousand-unit-per-hour movement, Dai Ershen's over-ton movement, Fu Guangyao learning to operate three types of lathes in six months, Zheng Jinyu's ten years of no absenteeism and no defective products, and Chen Xuanfang, a veteran master who taught sixty apprentices alone, and so on. Many such heroes are present today. If we were to read the names and deeds of each of them, it would not be a workload that could be completed in one day. Therefore, I will only cite the above-mentioned representative figures. These heroic figures are the pearls of our country's socialist construction, and the coral agate that enables our country to make a great leap forward. The representatives of these heroic figures are gathering in Beijing, and we should pay tribute to them.

    "The basic construction installation process and the trial production process of this factory have all received enthusiastic, careful, and responsible assistance from the comrades of the Soviet expert group. They unreservedly taught us their knowledge and technology meticulously. We can say with certainty that without their assistance, we could not have built this factory so smoothly. I would like to express my gratitude to all the comrades of the expert group!"

    Then, Comrade Tan Zhenlin gave high praise and warm encouragement to the Party committees and government departments at all levels that directly led this factory, and to the work of the relevant units that supported this factory.

    Tan Zhenlin concluded: "Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the leading comrades and all the staff of the Luoyang Tractor Manufacturing Plant! Thanks to your efforts and hard work, we have been able to build this factory smoothly. I believe that under the encouragement of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, we will greet the development of the agricultural mechanization movement with greater victories, and you will inevitably become a strong main force to support agricultural technical transformation. Comrades, you should muster greater revolutionary enthusiasm, manufacture more tractors and send them to the fields of the motherland, and strive for the continued leap forward with a posture of one victory after another, in order to accelerate the agricultural mechanization and agricultural modernization of our country."

    谭震林同志勉励第一拖拉机厂职工鼓足干劲
    让更多的铁牛开往田野
    据新华社洛阳1日电　中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理谭震林今天在第一拖拉机制造厂落成典礼大会上讲了话。
    谭震林说：“在我国建国十周年刚刚过去一个月的今天，一座现代化的、年产一万五千台五十四马力‘东方红’牌柴油拖拉机的洛阳第一拖拉机制造厂，在这儿举行隆重落成典礼。它是我国第一流的、具有最新技术装备的、规模宏大的工厂。它象征着我国建国十年以来的工业建设的辉煌成就。它的建成、投入生产，是今后十年中我国沿着农业现代化道路迈进的一个胜利的开端，我国农民早已盼望‘耕田不用牛，点灯不用油’的伟大时代已经开始到来了。党中央和毛主席关于加速我国农业现代化的号召，给拖拉机厂的职工们提出了极其光荣的任务。第一拖拉机制造厂是在全国范围内实现农业技术改造的一个骨干工厂。它将以源源不断的拖拉机，开入祖国辽阔广大的田野，代替黄牛耕田，代替黄牛车水，代替黄牛拉车。全国五亿农民今天以欢欣鼓舞的心情，庆祝这一座工厂的诞生，衷心感谢这座工厂的建设者们”。
    谭震林说：“洛阳拖拉机制造工厂是苏联援助我国建设的许多重点工厂之一。苏维埃联邦共和国政府和苏联人民，不仅以成套的设备援助我国的建设，而且派出自己的优秀的技术专家到我国来援助我们的建设。这个厂的建成，象征着中苏两国人民的友谊，证明着社会主义制度的优越。这是我国农业技术改造的一件大喜事。为此，我代表中国共产党中央委员会和中华人民共和国国务院，向全体职工同志们致以最热烈的祝贺！向伟大的苏联共产党和苏联政府致以衷心的感谢！向辛勤劳动的苏联专家同志们致以最热烈的祝贺！”
    他说：“洛阳拖拉机制造工厂建设时间虽然经过四年之久，但所有主要工程是在两年时间内建成的，即1956年和1958年。1956年是我国社会主义建设找到了一条大跃进的道路的年份；1958年是我国社会主义建设展开大跃进局面的年份。这座工厂的建设历史，又一次证明了党的社会主义建设总路线、社会主义建设大跃进是完全正确的。如果不信，请看：以三十八个工作日建成了这座工厂的心脏工程—发动机工场，这是有二万二千五百平方米的大厂房；以三十三天时间建成一万二千八百七十平方米的燃料系统工场的厂房，这样大的厂房通常需要半年或者一年时间才能建成的，我们只用了一个月多一点时间就建成了，这样飞跃的建设速度是我国建筑工程史上史无前例的。我们应当向我们在基本建设战线上的英雄们致敬。在我们这座工厂建设过程中，出现了这样一些令人敬佩的英雄人物，例如以三十八天建成一座大型厂房外型的建筑工程队伍，只用了二百五十个工人的辛勤劳动；三十二天建成一座大型厂房外型，用了更少的人工。我相信这样的英雄人物的英雄事迹将传遍全国，将在全国各个建设工地上开花结果，大大加快我国社会主义的建设速度。”
    谭震林说：“在边建设、边试制、边生产的号召下，全体职工同志在党的领导下，发挥了革命干劲，发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义的风格，不仅基本上掌握了生产操作技术，能够顺利完成流水生产，而且自己制造设备，97％的非标准设备和20％的标准设备都是自己制造出来的，并且直接参加安装和土建工程，节约了基本建设投资。
    “这些成就是同职工群众积极努力分不开的，是同姚长有、戴尔身、符光尧、郑锦裕等等英雄人物的模范行动分不开的。姚长有小组的千台时运动，戴尔身的超吨运动，符光尧六个月学会三种车床的操作，郑锦裕十年不缺勤、不出废品，陈旋芳老师傅一人带会六十位徒弟，等等。今天在座的就有许多这样的英雄们。如果要把他们每个人的姓名和事迹宣读一遍，那不是一天能够完成的工作量。所以，我只举出上述几位有代表性的人物。这些英雄人物是我国社会主义建设的珍珠，是我国能够大跃进的珊瑚玛瑙。这些英雄人物的代表正在北京集会，我们应当向他们致敬。
    “这个厂的基本建设安装过程和试制生产过程，都得到了苏联专家组的同志热忱的、细心的、负责的帮助。他们毫无保留地把自己的知识、技术，细心地教会我们。我们可以肯定地说，没有他们这样的援助，我们不可能如此顺利地建成这座工厂。我向专家组的全体同志表示感谢！”
    接着，谭震林同志对直接领导这个工厂的各级党委和政府部门，对于支援这个工厂的有关单位的工作，给予很高的评价和热情的鼓励。
    谭震林最后说：“最后，我向洛阳拖拉机制造厂的领导同志、全体工作人员表示感谢！由于你们的努力，由于你们的辛勤劳动，我们才能顺利地建成这座工厂。我相信在党的八届八中全会的鼓励下，我们将会以更大的胜利迎接农业机械化运动向前发展，你们势必成为一支强大的主力军来支援农业技术改造。同志们，你们应鼓起更大的革命干劲，制造更多的拖拉机开到祖国的田野上去，以一个胜利接一个胜利的姿态，为加速我国农业机械化农业现代化，为继续跃进而奋斗。”
