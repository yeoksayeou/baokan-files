Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 19th - The Cuban Workers' Confederation (CTC) held its tenth congress in Havana last night. The opening ceremony was conducted under the slogan of unity of the working class and defense of the revolution.

This is the first congress held since the overthrow of the dictatorship in January this year. Three thousand delegates, democratically elected from 1,800 trade union organizations, are participating in the congress. Invited to attend were World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Secretary Giuseppe Casadei, Latin American Labor Federation President Lombardo Toledano, Jean Marie, International Secretary of the Metal and Machine Workers' Union, affiliated with the WFTU, and trade union leaders from Uruguay, Colombia, and other Latin American countries.

Representatives from international workers' organizations, such as the Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers (ORIT), also attended the congress.

The congress will hear a report on the activities of the trade union since January this year by David Salvador, General Manager of the Executive Committee of the CTC. It will also discuss four issues: organization and finance, social legislation, political and economic protection, and the expansion of the CTC's international activities.

Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro and Minister of Revolutionary Armed Forces Raúl Castro attended the opening ceremony of the congress.

Salvador, General Manager of the Executive Committee of the CTC, delivered the opening speech. He stressed that this congress is "fundamentally" different from the ninth congress. He said that the previous congress did not represent the working class, but the factory owners, and served the Batista tyranny. He pointed out that the main purpose of this congress is to defend the revolution. Salvador reiterated that all trade union organizations support land reform and industrialization, and support the struggle to defend national sovereignty. He announced: "We are ready to take up arms to defend the revolution. We demand that all workers in Cuba receive military training and be organized into military organizations." The congress responded to his remarks with prolonged cheers.

Prime Minister Castro spoke at the meeting. He said that the working class is a "decisive" factor in Cuban policy, "because it was the working class and the Rebel Army who, with the glorious general strike in January, prevented others from stealing the victory. It was the general strike that crushed the last conspiracy of the defeated, handed over the fortress of the capital to us, and gave the entire regime to the revolution." He emphasized that at a time when the moment to take up arms to defend the revolution may come, the Cuban government relies primarily on the pure people, basically composed of workers and peasants.

Castro condemned domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary conspiracies. He said that what unites us first and foremost is the revolution, which is in all our interests. The assembled enemies also force us to unite. They would be happiest to see a split in this congress. This congress should be a model of unity. He said that our two major tasks now are: to defend the revolution, to advance the revolution, and to promote the economic development of our country. The government will never stagnate in the face of any obstacles, and will ensure the final victory of the revolution and the welfare of the people.

Castro announced: "We are about to take measures to train you (militarily) as soon as possible. We will issue each person a gun to defend the government, to defend the revolution. Every house in Cuba will become a trench and a fortress, which means the disillusionment of all counter-revolutionary dreams." As he said these words, everyone stood up and cheered thunderously.

Minister of Revolutionary Armed Forces Raúl Castro said in his speech that the Revolutionary Armed Forces and the workers support each other on the same basis. When talking about purging traitors and vacillating elements from the revolutionary ranks, he said: "First, we must all unite to carry out the cleansing work, and second, there may still be bad elements even within the working class, which are the remnants left over from the tragic past." He said that the working class must also eliminate the Mujal elements who served the Batista tyranny.

At the opening ceremony, a resolution was passed on the proposal of some representatives, condemning the newspapers such as Cuba's "Free Press," "Forward," and "Ocean Daily" for carrying out counter-revolutionary propaganda. During the conference, the delegates strongly condemned the Mujal elements who ruled the trade unions during the dictatorship and the remaining Mujal elements who are still trying to survive in the Cuban workers' movement. The delegates booed the representatives of the Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers (ORIT), which is controlled by the United States, and shouted for them to "Get out!" while warmly applauding the representatives of the Latin American Labor Federation.

    古巴工人联合会举行代表大会
    准备拿起武器保卫革命
    卡斯特罗宣布将尽快对工人进行军事训练
    新华社哈瓦那19日电　古巴工人联合会第十次代表大会昨天晚上在这里隆重开幕，开幕式是在工人阶级的团结和保卫革命的口号下进行的。
    这是今年1月推翻独裁政权以来举行的第一次代表大会，参加大会的有从一千八百个工会组织中民主选出的三千名代表。应邀参加大会的有世界工会联合会书记朱塞佩·卡萨迪，拉丁美洲劳工联盟主席隆巴多·托列达诺，属于世界工会联合会的五金机器工人工会国际书记让·马里耶尔，以及乌拉圭、哥伦比亚等拉丁美洲国家的工会领导人。
    参加大会的还有美洲区域工人组织等国际工人组织的代表。
    这次代表大会将听取古巴工人联合会执行委员会总负责人戴维·萨尔瓦多关于今年1月以来工会活动的报告；并将讨论组织和财政、社会立法、政治和经济保护及扩大古巴工人联合会的国际活动四个问题。
    古巴总理菲德尔·卡斯特罗以及革命武装部部长劳尔·卡斯特罗等参加了大会的开幕式。
    古巴工人联合会执行委员会总负责人萨尔瓦多致开幕词。他强调指出：这次代表大会同第九次代表大会有“根本”区别。他说，前一次代表大会并不代表工人阶级，而是代表厂主，并且是为巴蒂斯塔暴政效劳的。他指出，这次代表大会的主要目的是保卫革命。萨尔瓦多重申：所有的工会组织都支持土地改革和工业化，支持保卫国家主权的斗争。他宣布：“我们准备拿起武器保卫革命。我们要求对古巴所有的工人实行军事训练和把我们编在军事组织中。”大会对他的这一番话报以长久不息的欢呼声。
    总理卡斯特罗在会上讲了话。他说，工人阶级是古巴政策中的“决定性”因素，“因为是工人阶级和起义军一起以光荣的一月总罢工使别人没有能够窃取胜利。是总罢工粉碎了战败者的最后一个阴谋，把首都的堡垒交给了我们，并把整个政权给了革命”。他强调指出，在今天当要拿起武器保卫革命的时刻可能到来时，古巴政府依靠的首先是基本上由工人和农民组成的纯朴的人民。
    卡斯特罗谴责国内外的反革命阴谋。他说，把我们团结起来的首先是革命，这是我们所有人的利益。纠合起来的敌人也迫使我们团结起来。他们最高兴的就是看到这次大会的分裂。这次大会应该成为团结无间的典范。他说，我们现在的两大任务是：保卫革命、使革命前进，和促进我国的经济发展。政府决不会在任何障碍面前停滞不前，并要保证革命的最后胜利和人民的福利。
    卡斯特罗宣布：“我们即将开始采取措施，尽快对你们进行（军事）训练。我们将发给每人一支枪来保卫政府，保卫革命，古巴的每一所房屋都将成为战壕和堡垒，这意味着一切反革命梦想的幻灭。”当他说这几句话的时候，全体起立，欢声雷动。
    革命武装部部长劳尔·卡斯特罗讲话时说，革命武装部队和工人是在同一个基础上互相支持的。他在谈到清除革命队伍中的叛徒和动摇分子时说：“第一，我们大家得联合起来进行清洗工作，第二，即使在工人阶级内部也还可能有坏分子，这是悲惨的过去所遗留下来的残余。”他说，工人阶级也要清除为巴蒂斯塔暴政效劳的穆哈耳分子。
    在开幕会上，根据一些代表的提议通过一项决议，对古巴“自由新闻报”、“前进报”、“海洋日报”等进行反革命宣传的报纸提出谴责。在大会进行期间，代表们强烈地谴责独裁政权时期统治工会的穆哈耳以及仍然企图在古巴工人运动中苟延残喘的残余穆哈耳分子。代表们对美国控制的美洲区域工人组织的代表发出嘘声，并且高喊要他们“滚出去！”而对拉丁美洲劳工联盟的代表报以热烈的欢呼声。
