Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 23rd: In the face of a severe drought unseen in decades, the people of Sichuan Province, under the leadership of the Party, have this year overcome the drought with unparalleled heroism, realizing the call of the Provincial Party Committee to "maintain production in heavily affected areas, increase production in lightly affected areas, and greatly increase production in basically unaffected areas." According to statistics, among the province's twenty-eight heavily affected counties, most have managed to maintain production and slightly increase production, with only a small number experiencing a slight decrease in total output compared to last year. Some heavily affected counties, such as Dianjiang County, even saw significant increases in production. All fifty-seven lightly affected counties (cities) increased production. The remaining one hundred and ten basically unaffected counties generally increased production by 10% to 20%. The province has also seen nine counties achieving 1,000 jin of rice per mu, two counties achieving 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and five counties achieving 1,000 jin of corn or early corn per mu. Looking at the province as a whole, total grain output has increased compared to last year.

This year, since the beginning of spring, most areas of Sichuan Province have experienced prolonged lack of rain, with spring, summer, and autumn droughts occurring in succession, creating a severe drought unseen in decades. In April, drought conditions began to appear in some areas. From April to September, only the western, northwestern, and southeastern parts of Sichuan received one or two heavy rainfalls in mid-July and mid-August. The rest of the time, rainfall was scarce, and drought conditions continued to develop. For example, in July, the rainfall in nine prefectures including Jiangjin, Daxian, Wanxian, Fuling, and Chongqing City was only 20% to 60% of the normal amount for the same period. In August, the rainfall in Daxian Prefecture was only 7% of the normal amount for the same period. During this period, the drought-stricken areas in the province reached eighty-five counties (suburbs) in ten prefectures and two cities. The area of drought-affected cultivated land reached more than 58 million mu, accounting for 51.2% of the province's cultivated land area. Drought conditions rose and fell one after another, continuously, with some areas experiencing no thorough rain for fifty or sixty consecutive days. Rivers and streams dried up, ponds and reservoirs bottomed out, and rice paddies cracked. The spring drought delayed the planting time of some major spring crops, and a small number of paddy fields were converted to dry crops. The summer drought seriously affected the flowering and grain filling of crops such as rice and corn, and the planting of sweet potatoes. The autumn drought made the seedling growth conditions of late autumn crops very unfavorable. Due to the impact of the drought, the climate was disrupted, and floods, waterlogging, wind, hail, and pests and diseases were also more serious than in previous years.

Under the leadership of the Party, the people of the entire province launched a vigorous anti-drought struggle. The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China continuously instructed all localities, from the first signs of drought, to face up to the severity of the situation, recognize the favorable conditions, adopt active measures, and fully mobilize the masses to overcome the disaster. Therefore, all localities started early and acted quickly, and the broad masses of people threw themselves into the anti-drought battle with full confidence. As the drought developed, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the call to the entire Party and the entire people: "Maintain production in heavily affected areas, increase production in lightly affected areas, and greatly increase production in basically unaffected areas," pointing out the direction and goals of the struggle to the people of the province. Li Jingquan, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and many other responsible comrades, personally went to areas severely affected by the drought to understand the situation, summarize experiences, and personally guide the anti-drought struggle. Anti-drought command organizations were established at all levels in the province and in drought-stricken areas.

Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of people in the drought-stricken areas of the province, with high morale, put forward the slogans "Rather shed a thousand drops of sweat than let a single seedling die" and "Fight the disaster until the day of harvest, protect the seedlings until the grain enters the granary." They tried every possible means to find water sources, while fully utilizing existing water resources and water conservancy projects, rationally and economically using water, vigorously repairing, manufacturing, and fully utilizing various water-lifting tools, and carrying out the struggle to resist drought, save seedlings, protect seedlings, and rush planting and replanting. In the anti-drought effort, Daxian Prefecture mobilized more than 3 million people, used the favorable terrain of the mountainous areas to intercept streams and block flows in more than 160,000 places, found more than 660,000 water sources, and irrigated more than 7 million mu of drought-affected cultivated land, recovering more than 2 billion jin of grain. Most of the more than 8 million mu of intermediate rice and sweet potatoes in Mianyang Prefecture were planted by fighting the drought and rushing to plant. In many places in Zitong County, water was carried up the mountains from more than ten li away. More than 17 million dan of water were carried in more than half a month, and 120,000 mu of sweet potatoes were rushed to be planted. Along the Fujiang and Jialing Rivers, the masses in many places used dozens or hundreds of waterwheels connected in a row to turn the river water up the high mountains. In Fengdu County, in the anti-drought effort to protect seedlings, the masses took out their own mats, blankets, quilts, and clothes to cover the crops, protecting the seedlings from being scorched to death by the sun. As the moisture on the ground evaporated in large quantities, the broad masses put forward the slogans of getting water from the big rivers, getting water from the high mountains, and getting water from the underground. They found abandoned wells, dug earthen wells, dug dragon caves, dug pond bottoms, and diverted water up the mountains. In areas with scarce water sources, many methods were adopted to prevent moisture evaporation, such as wrapping seedlings with wet soil, loosening the soil, covering them, and filling cracks with fertilizer mud. Seven or eight members of the Longdong Commune in Wulong County climbed up the high mountains, used ropes to hang over the cliffs, found spring water, and diverted water down the mountains, saving 500 mu of rice fields from disaster. According to incomplete statistics, due to the adoption of these methods, the province irrigated and rescued more than 43 million mu of drought-affected crops in the anti-drought effort, greatly reducing the losses from the disaster.

The people's communes in various places fully exploited the superiority of being large in scale and public in nature during the anti-drought effort, uniformly using manpower and materials, and carrying out large-scale cooperation to ensure the needs of the anti-drought struggle. During the anti-drought period, the province invested more than 10 million people every day at its peak, and dispatched 15 million pieces of various tools. The people's communes accomplished many things that were impossible in the past. Kaijiang County, located in a hilly area, has a dense river network, and the conditions for building large-scale river-blocking dams are very good. Although some projects had been built before last year, they could not meet the needs of drought resistance. This year, in the anti-drought effort, the people's communes of the county concentrated their efforts and built 800 river-blocking dams and many small dams in one go, intercepting more than 5,000 flows, forming an irrigation network with crisscrossing rivers and canals, enabling the drought-affected rice fields to be irrigated.

In the struggle to resist drought and ensure harvest, the communes in various places, based on the favorable conditions of the local mild climate and long crop growing season, used all available land to carry out a movement to increase planting. In many disaster areas, many late autumn crops were planted and then scorched to death, but the masses were in high spirits and replanted repeatedly, some even up to six or seven times. Xuanhan County repeatedly replanted 150,000 mu of late autumn crops. In Dazhu County, a heavily affected area, 180,000 mu of crops were killed by the drought, but the masses in the county then increased planting, converted planting, and replanted more than 600,000 mu. Late autumn crops were planted in all fields, corners of land, in front of and behind houses, and in barren flat areas and open dams. This alone recovered more than 100 million jin of grain.

    奋战五个月连续战胜春、夏、秋严重干旱
    四川重灾区保产轻灾区增产
    二十八个重灾县中少部分县产量略有减少，大部分县保产和稍有增产五十七个轻灾县全部增产，一百一十个基本无灾县一般增产一至二成
    四川今年大旱是几十年所未有过的。全省受旱地区先后达到十个专区和两个市的八十五个县（郊区），受旱耕地五千八百多万亩，占全省耕地面积51.2％。
    新华社成都23日电　在几十年未有的严重干旱面前，四川省人民今年在党的领导下以无比的英雄气概战胜干旱，实现了省委提出的“重灾区要保产，轻灾区要增产，基本无灾区要大增产”的号召。据统计，全省二十八个重灾县，除少部分县的总产量比去年略有减少外，大部分都作到了保产和稍有增产，有些重灾县，如垫江县等还有较大的增产；五十七个轻灾县（市）全部增产；其余一百一十个基本无灾县一般都增产一成到两成。全省还出现了九个水稻千斤县，两个皮棉百斤县，五个玉米或早玉米千斤县。就全省情况来看，粮食总产量比去年还有所增加。
    今年，四川省入春以来，大部地区长期缺雨，春旱、夏旱、秋旱相继出现，造成了几十年来未有过的大旱。4月份，部分地区即发生旱象，从4月到9月的五个月中，仅7月中旬和8月中旬川西、川西北和川东南各降过大雨一次到两次，其余时间雨水稀少，旱象不断发展。如7月份江津、达县、万县、涪陵等九个专区和重庆市的降雨量，仅为常年同期的20％到60％。8月份，达县专区降雨量仅为常年同期的7％。在这期间，全省受旱地区先后达到十个专区和两个市的八十五个县（郊区）。受旱耕地面积达五千八百多万亩，占全省耕地面积51.2％。各地旱象此起彼伏，持续不断，部分地区连续五、六十天未下过透雨，河溪断流，塘库见底，稻田干裂。春旱使部分地区推迟了大春作物的播种时间，少数水田改种了旱作物。夏旱严重地影响了水稻、玉米等作物扬花孕穗和红薯的栽种工作。秋旱又使晚秋作物苗期生长条件十分不利，由于天旱的影响，气候失调，洪、涝、风、雹和病虫害也比往年严重。
    全省人民在党的领导下，展开了轰轰烈烈的抗旱斗争。中共四川省委从干旱一露头就不断指示各地正视形势的严重性，认清有利条件，采取积极措施，充分发动群众战胜灾害。因此，各地动手早，动手快，广大群众信心百倍地投入了抗旱战斗。随着干旱的发展，省委又向全党全民提出了“重灾要保产，轻灾要增产，基本无灾区要大增产”的号召，给全省人民指出了斗争的方向和目标。省委第一书记李井泉和其他许多负责同志都先后亲赴旱情严重的地区了解情况，总结经验，亲自指导抗旱斗争。省和受旱地区都层层建立了抗旱指挥机构。
    全省受旱地区的广大人民，在党的领导下，斗志昂扬，提出“宁愿流下千滴汗，不愿干死一株苗”，“抗灾抗到丰收日，保苗保到粮入仓”的口号，千方百计寻找水源，同时充分发挥现有水量和水利工程作用，合理节约用水，大力修补、制造和充分运用各种提水工具，开展抗旱救苗保苗、抢种抢栽的斗争。达县专区在抗旱中出动三百多万人，利用山区有利地形，截溪阻流达十六万多处，找水源六十六万多处，浇灌受旱耕地七百多万亩，夺回粮食二十亿斤以上。绵阳专区八百多万亩中稻和红薯大部都是抗旱抢种的。梓潼县许多地方从十几里以外挑水上山，半个多月挑水一千七百多万担，抢栽红薯十二万亩。沿着涪江和嘉陵江，许多地方的群众用几十部、成百部水车连成一气，把河水翻上高山。酆都县在抗旱保苗中群众拿出自己的席子、毯子、被单和衣服盖住庄稼，保护禾苗不让太阳晒死。随着地面水分大量蒸发，广大群众提出了向大河要水，向高山要水，向地下要水的口号，纷纷找废井、打土井、挖龙洞、挖塘底、引水上山。水源稀少的地区，采用了用湿土包苗、松土、加盖、用肥泥填裂缝等许多防止水分蒸发的办法。武隆县龙洞公社七、八个社员，爬上高山，用绳子吊着翻过悬崖，找到泉水，引水下山，使五百亩稻田免除灾害。据不完全统计，由于采取了这些办法，在抗旱中全省共浇灌抢救了四千三百多万亩受旱作物，大大减少了灾害的损失。
    各地人民公社在抗旱中充分发挥了一大二公的优越性，统一使用人力物力，开展大协作，保证了抗旱斗争的需要。在抗旱期中，全省最多每天投入一千多万人，出动各种工具一千五百万件。人民公社办到了许多过去无法实现的事情。丘陵地区的开江县，全县河网密布，修建大型拦河堰条件很好，去年以前虽然兴修了一些工程，但是还不能满足抗旱的需要。今年在抗旱中，全县人民公社集中力量一气就修成八百条拦河堰和许多小堰，截流五千多处，形成一个河渠纵横的灌溉网，使受旱稻田得到灌溉。
    在抗旱保收斗争中，各地公社根据当地气候温和，作物生长期长的有利条件，利用一切土地开展增种运动。许多灾区不少晚秋作物种上又被晒死，但是群众斗志昂扬，反复补种，有的甚至达六、七次。宣汉县反复抢种的晚秋作物就达十五万亩。重灾区大竹县全县有十八万亩作物被旱死，但全县群众接着就增种改种补种了六十多万亩，田边地角，房前屋后，荒坪空坝，全种上了晚秋作物，仅这一项，就收回粮食一亿多斤。
