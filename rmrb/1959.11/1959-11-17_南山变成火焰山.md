South Mountain Becomes Flaming Mountain

Worker Du Juanhua

Furnaces linked to mountains, fire linked to sky,
Green smoke floats to the white clouds on high,
The Qinling Mountains tremble and cry,
South Mountain becomes Flaming Mountain nigh.

Flaming Mountain, Flaming Plain,
Flaming blazes, crimson stain,
If you ask how large the flame’s domain,
Enough to boil the Eastern Sea’s main.

With the commune’s Flaming Mountain in sight,
Roots of poverty burn out of might,
Layer upon layer, tall buildings take flight,
Iron oxen till the land with all their might.

Flaming Mountain, oh Flaming Mountain,
Happiness with you is tightly spanned,
The East Wind assists with great command,
The motherland is spring in every land.

Flaming light is rose, why muted so?
Moonlight’s gleam, why dimmed also?
The stars of the Big Dipper, why no glow,
Could it be the sun has fallen below?

Roses never had such hue so grand,
The moon's face never had this hue at hand,
Stars fill the sky, night after night, planned,
The sun still hangs in the sky, as command.

This is the new steel plant, it’s true,
Ten thousand golden rays shoot to the blue,
Golden light paints heaven and earth anew,
Golden light pierces mountains through.

Ten thousand mountains, smiles unfold,
Towards the sun, a shout bold,
“Look at us, six hundred million steel heroes of old,
We’ll cast a golden mountain, a story to be told!”

    南山变成火焰山
    工人　杜绢花炉连山，火连天，青烟飘上白云端，秦岭烧得乱打颤，南山变成火焰山。火焰山，火焰川，火焰熊熊烧红天，若问火焰有多大，能把东海水烧煎。公社有了火焰山，穷苦根子烧个干，层层高楼平地起，群群铁牛把地翻。火焰山哟火焰山，幸福和你紧相连，东风给你助攻势，祖国四季是春天。
   火光玫瑰花，为啥喑？月亮光，为啥淡？北斗星宿怎不亮，莫非太阳落人间？玫瑰那有这样红，月儿更没这容颜，满天星斗夜夜明，太阳依旧挂天边。这是新建炼铁厂，万道金光射九天，金光射得天地红，金光射透万重山。万重山，笑开颜，朝着太阳大声喊，“看我们六亿钢铁汉，要铸座金山戳破天！”
