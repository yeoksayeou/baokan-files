A Vanguard on the Transportation Front
    ——Introducing Su Changfu, Squad Leader of the Automotive Driving Team of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps

Comrade Su Changfu, Squad Leader of the Driving Team of the Third Company, Second Battalion, Automotive Transportation Department, Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps, is a model Communist Party member and a Special-Grade Labor Model of the Corps. The GAZ-150 truck he drove achieved a record of 500,000 kilometers of safe and economical operation without major overhaul of the original engine from July 1951 to August 1957. This extended the period between major overhauls by almost ten times the state-stipulated interval.

In the ten years since liberation, Comrade Su Changfu has consistently overfulfilled his tasks on the Xinjiang transportation front. Since 1952, he has been repeatedly recognized as an advanced producer. In 1955, he was named an A-Grade Labor Model for highway transportation in Xinjiang. In 1958, he was named a Special-Grade Labor Model of the Corps, and in 1957 and 1958 he was consecutively named an Outstanding Party Member, later being named a Model Party Member. In 1958, the Soviet Likhachev Automobile Plant awarded him an honorary certificate. Su Changfu has become a shining red banner on the Xinjiang automotive transportation front, and the truck he drove, which safely traveled 500,000 kilometers without major overhaul, has been sent to Beijing to be exhibited at the People's Liberation Army Military Museum.

In every critical moment when faced with arduous tasks, Comrade Su Changfu always leads the masses forward by setting an example. In 1958, when his company was assigned to the Wuku Highway for the third time, a few drivers, fearing the treacherous mountain roads, were reluctant to participate. Although Su Changfu was ill at the time, he still proactively requested permission from the leadership to go into the mountains. Seeing him go up the mountain, many people were encouraged and strengthened their resolve to go. On one occasion, while stationed in small dugouts in Karamay, he was affected by the dampness and could not straighten his back the next day. He needed assistance to get in and out of the truck. Despite this, to avoid affecting the completion of the task, he insisted on driving the truck back to Urumqi.

Cherishing the Truck Like His Own Life

Su Changfu cherishes the truck like his own life. In the summer of 1956, when the truck was undergoing a mid-level repair, Su Changfu was suffering from dysentery and had become extremely thin, even staggering when he walked. However, he insisted on working with the maintenance workers to repair the truck. The leadership, concerned about his health, ordered him to rest, but he couldn't bear to leave and secretly went to the vehicle yard at night. He treated every part of the truck with meticulous care. Electrical wires and brake hoses were prone to friction, so he wrapped them in cloth. As a result, even now, one of the original brake hoses is still in use. Mudguards were easily damaged on Xinjiang's snowy and muddy roads, so he regularly removed, washed, and oiled them to prevent rust. Consequently, the original mudguards are still in use. When driving empty, to prevent bumps and vibrations, he would tie the truck bed to the frame with rope, so the truck bed is still intact. When the truck was heavily loaded and stopped, he always used a piece of wood to prop up the rear of the truck, reducing the burden on the tires and body. When crossing rivers, he would first wade into the water to check the depth before crossing. He installed filtered gauze covers on the water tank opening and inside the oil pipe, wherever water, oil, or air entered, to prevent dirt from entering and damaging the truck. If he found any problems with the truck while driving, even minor ones, he would stop and fix them before continuing.

Su Changfu has transported various materials and has rarely lost or damaged anything. In 1951, when transporting cement from Huocheng, he encountered heavy rain when passing through Lucao溝. At the time, there was no tarpaulin, so to prevent the cement from deteriorating after being exposed to rain, he covered the cement with his own bedding. Inspired by him, drivers from more than thirty other trucks opened their luggage to ensure the safety of over one hundred tons of cement. He often said, "I would rather suffer more myself than let state property be damaged."

Helping Comrades, Caring for Passengers

Helping comrades overcome difficulties is Su Changfu's consistent noble virtue. During his many years of driving, whenever he encountered other vehicles breaking down, he would always use his own truck to tow them for a distance to a place where they could get food and lodging. In March 1957, while traveling to Huocheng, he encountered a Uyghur driver in the Gobi Desert near Jinghe whose truck had broken down due to a lack of technical skills. The driver had been repairing the truck from three in the morning until four in the afternoon, and was hungry, cold, and anxious. Su Changfu quickly got out of his truck to help him inspect and repair it, and helped him start the engine. He also gave the driver from the fraternal ethnic group the bread he had brought. The driver was moved and repeatedly said, "Rahmat!" (Thank you!) In the summer of 1956, while transporting grain to southern Xinjiang, he encountered a flood in Heizu, Baicheng County. Gong Dejun's truck from the same company was trapped in the river, and the water had submerged the tires. Su Changfu initially tried to tow the truck with his own, but when that didn't work, he jumped into the water, still wearing his clothes, and helped carry the grain, bag by bag, off the truck. Finally, they managed to pull the truck out of the flood.

Caring for passengers, caring for the elderly, women, and children, providing convenience to passengers, and satisfying passengers are concrete manifestations of Su Changfu's love for the people. In the autumn of 1956, Su Changfu participated in the construction of the Wuku Highway in Houxia. One night, a Kazakh villager came and asked Su Changfu to take his wife to the hospital in Urumqi because she was experiencing a difficult labor. Although Su Changfu was already very tired, and the road from Houxia to Urumqi was very dangerous and difficult, he thought that saving a life was of utmost importance, and that the Party taught that helping people of all ethnic groups build a happy and prosperous life in the border areas was the glorious task of the people's automobile team. So, he resolutely drove his truck, feeling his way along the dangerous night road, and took the pregnant woman to the Urumqi People's Hospital, where she gave birth smoothly after receiving treatment. Thanks to Su Changfu's enthusiastic help, the lives of both mother and child were saved.

He also patiently helps comrades with their driving skills. Many drivers have improved their skills with his help and have achieved significant results in their work. For example, Liu Zixin's previous two engines had not even traveled 40,000 kilometers. Once, when he and Su Changfu were driving together to Ce Daye, Liu Zixin woke up from a nap and found Su Changfu quietly repairing his truck. He was deeply moved and determined to learn from Su Changfu. Later, his third engine was extended to 150,000 kilometers without replacing the pistons, and he achieved 350,000 kilometers without accidents, and was repeatedly recognized as an advanced producer. In the past ten years, Su Changfu has trained more than a dozen young drivers. His method of training assistants is characterized by patient instruction, attention to detail, strict requirements, and a kind attitude, so that his assistants not only improve their skills but also develop the same excellent driving ethics and operating style as Su Changfu.

He is not only enthusiastic in helping comrades with their skills, but also very concerned about their political and ideological progress. Party member Yang Kanzhong, for a time, became arrogant and complacent after being praised for safe driving, and the masses had a negative reaction. After Comrade Su Changfu learned about this, he talked to him, helped him recognize his shortcomings, and thus consolidated his achievements. He has now driven safely for more than 460,000 kilometers.

Enthusiastic Learning, Hard Work and Plain Living

Although Su Changfu has achieved remarkable results and received high honors, he has never been arrogant or complacent, and has always been modest and humble. It can be said that he can withstand the test of difficult environments and also the test of victory and honor. It is precisely because he possesses this valuable quality that he can consolidate his achievements and continue to move forward, and can be even more praised and loved by the broad masses.

Su Changfu never misses an opportunity to learn and is good at absorbing the advanced experiences of others to make up for his own shortcomings. Previously, he lacked experience in the use of tires, and they did not last long. Since learning from Comrade An Guodong's experience, he has greatly improved the life of his tires. From 1952 to 1958, he overran the tire kilometer count by a total of 800,000 kilometers. In 1957 and 1958 alone, he overran by more than 420,000 kilometers. In the past, his fuel economy was not outstanding. Since learning Comrade Wang Zesheng's fuel-saving methods, in 1958, his average fuel consumption was 17 kilograms per 100 kilometers, saving more than 4,000 kilograms of fuel for the year. This number is equal to 159% of the total amount of fuel he saved from 1952 to 1957.

Comrade Su Changfu has always been diligent and thrifty, never wasting a penny, and has carried forward the fine traditions of hard work and plain living of the People's Liberation Army. In the past ten years, he has never had clothes made specifically for him, and he wears the plain yellow uniforms and white shirts issued by the higher authorities. He wore one cotton-padded coat for four years and one pair of fur shoes for four winters. During his many years of driving, when he was hungry and could not reach a station, he would eat dry rations and drink plain water to satisfy his hunger and thirst. Sometimes, when he slept in the Gobi Desert, exposed to wind, sand, and cold, he never complained.

Su Changfu is not satisfied with the achievements he has already made. Now, he has proposed to the Autonomous Region Party Committee that he strive to extend the life of the original engine to 600,000 kilometers without major overhaul by 1960, and that after the engine undergoes one major overhaul, he strive to reach 1 million kilometers without major overhaul. This leaping-forward target fully demonstrates Su Changfu's spirit of continuous revolution and his spirit of courage and determination.

    运输战线上的一员闯将
    ——介绍新疆军区建设兵团汽车驾驶班长苏长福
    新疆军区生产建设兵团机运处汽车二营三连驾驶班长苏长福同志，是模范共产党员、兵团特级劳动模范。他驾驶的吉斯150型货运汽车，从1951年7月到1957年8月，创造了原车引擎安全节约五十万公里无大修的成绩。根据国家规定，延长了将近十个大修期。
    解放十年来，苏长福同志在新疆运输战线上，历年都超额完成了任务。自1952年以来，连年被评为先进生产者，1955年评为新疆公路运输甲等劳动模范，1958年被评为兵团特级劳动模范，并在1957年与1958年连续被评为优秀党员，后又被评为模范党员。1958年，苏联李哈乔夫汽车制造厂曾授予他荣誉证书。苏长福已成为新疆汽车运输战线上一面光辉的红旗，他所驾驶的安全行驶五十万公里无大修的汽车已送到北京参加人民解放军军事博物馆展览。
    苏长福同志在每次执行艰苦任务的紧急关头，总是以身作则带领群众前进，1958年，他们连里第三次到乌库公路执行任务时，有少数驾驶员畏惧山路险峻，不愿参加。苏长福当时虽然身体有病，仍然主动要求领导上批准他进山去。许多人见他上了山，都纷纷增强了信心，坚定了上山的决心。有一次到克拉玛依，住在小地窑里，因受了潮湿，第二天腰疼得直不起来，上车都得助手扶着上，下车也要人搀着下。就这样，为了不影响完成任务，他仍坚持把车开到乌鲁木齐。
    爱车如同爱生命
    苏长福爱护汽车像爱惜自己的生命。1956年夏天，车子进行中修时，苏长福正拉痢疾，瘦得不成人样，走路都有些踉跄。但是他仍然坚持跟保修工人一块修车。领导上关心他的健康，命令他休息，他放心不下，夜里又悄悄地到车场去了。他对待车子各部机件都作到了无微不至的爱护。电线油管刹车皮管容易磨擦，他用布包扎起来，所以直到现在原车的一边刹车皮管还在使用着。挡泥板在新疆地区的积雪泥污道路上很容易损坏，他就经常把挡泥板拆下、洗净，并涂上机油防止锈蚀，因而原车上的挡泥板也一直使用到现在。空车行驶时，为防止颠波震动，他就用绳子把车箱与大梁捆在一起，因而车箱到现在还是完整的。重车停下时，他总是用根木头把后车顶起来，以减轻轮胎与车身的负担。过河时，他总是先下水探测了深浅再通过。在水箱口上和机油管内，凡是加油加水通空气的地方，都装上了滤净的沙罩，免得脏东西进入内部伤害车子。在行车中如发现车子有毛病，那怕很小的毛病，也要暂停下来修好才走。
    苏长福运过各种物资，很少有遗失和损坏。1951年由霍城运水泥，经过芦草沟时赶上天下大雨。当时没有篷布，为了防止水泥被雨淋后变质，他就用自己的被褥把水泥盖上。同行三十多辆车上的驾驶员在他的带动下，都纷纷打开了行李，保证了这一百多吨水泥的完好无损。他常说：“宁肯自己多受点苦，决不能让国家财产受损失。”
    帮助同志　关心旅客
    帮助同志解决困难是苏长福一贯的高尚美德。在常年的行车途中，每当遇到了别的车辆抛锚，他总是用自己的车子帮助对方拖一段路，赶到有吃饭的和住宿的地方。1957年3月他到霍城去，在精河附近的戈壁滩上遇见了一个维吾尔族驾驶员，因技术不熟练，车子抛了锚。这位驾驶员从早上三点一直修到下午四点钟，还没有把车子修好，真是又饿又冷又着急。苏长福迅速地下车帮助他检查、修理，并帮助他把车子发动起来，还把随带的馍馍给那位兄弟民族驾驶员吃。那个驾驶员感动得连声说：“热合买提！”（谢谢！）1956年夏天，他到南疆运粮，在拜城黑嘴地方遇到洪水，同连的龚得钧的车子陷在河里，水把轮胎都淹没了。苏长福起初用车帮助拖；拖不出来，他就穿着衣服跳进水里，帮助把车上的粮食一袋一袋地扛下来。最后终于把车子从洪水中拉了出来。
    关心旅客，关心妇老弱幼，给乘客方便，使乘客满意，是苏长福热爱人民的具体表现。1956年秋天，苏长福在后峡参加修建乌库公路。一天夜晚，有位哈萨克族老乡来要求苏长福把他的爱人送往乌鲁木齐医院里，因为他爱人难产。苏长福虽然已很疲乏，而那时自后峡到乌鲁木齐市的一段路又非常险峻难走，但是他想到拯救生命要紧，想到党教导的在边疆帮助各族人民建立幸福美好的生活是人民汽车队的光荣任务，就毅然驾驶车子摸着危险的夜路，把产妇送到乌鲁木齐人民医院，使这位产妇经过诊治而顺利生产。由于苏长福的热情帮助，挽救了母子二人的生命。
    在驾驶技术上，他也总是耐心地帮助同志。有许多驾驶员都在他的帮助下，提高了技术，并且在工作中取得了显著的成绩。如刘子信过去用过的两只发动机都没有行驶到四万公里。有一次他和苏长福一起行车到策大雅，刘子信在午睡醒来时，发现苏长福正悄悄地给他修理车子，他深受感动，下决心要向苏长福学习。后来他的第三只发动机一直延长到十五万公里还没有换活塞，并做到了三十五万公里无事故，连年被评为先进生产者。十年来，苏长福培养了十几名青年驾驶员。他培养助手的特点是教授耐心，注意小节，要求严格，态度和蔼，使助手们不仅提高了技术，而且也养成了像苏长福一样的优良驾驶道德和操作作风。
    他不仅在技术上热心帮助同志，也非常关心同志们政治思想上的进步。党员杨看中有一度因安全行车受到表扬，产生了骄傲自满情绪，群众反映不好，苏长福同志知道后就找他谈话，使他认识了自己的缺点，从而巩固了成绩，现已安全行驶了四十六万多公里。
    热心学习　艰苦朴素
    苏长福虽已创造了惊人的成绩和获得了很高的荣誉，但他从来不骄傲自满，一贯虚心谦逊，真可以说是经得起艰苦环境的考验，也经得起胜利和荣誉的考验。正因为他具有这个宝贵的品质，他才能巩固成绩不断前进，才能更加受到广大群众的赞扬和热爱。
    苏长福从不放过学习的机会，善于吸取别人的先进经验来弥补自己的不足。以前，他对轮胎使用方面缺乏经验，行驶公里不长，自从学习了安国栋同志的经验后，大大提高了轮胎使用寿命，自1952年到1958年七年来共超驶了八十万胎公里，仅1957年和1958年两年中就超驶了四十二万多胎公里。过去，他节约汽油并不突出，自从学习了王泽生同志的节油方法后，1958年全年平均每百公里消耗十七公斤汽油，全年共节约四千多公斤汽油。这个数字等于他1952年至1957年节约汽油总数的159％。
    苏长福同志一贯克勤克俭，从不浪费分文，发扬了人民解放军艰苦朴素的优良传统。十年来，他自己没有专门做过衣服，穿的都是上级发的平布黄军服与白衬衫。他的一件棉衣穿了四年，一双毛皮鞋穿了四冬。他在常年行车中，有时肚子饿了赶不上站，就啃干粮、喝白水来充饥解渴；有时露宿戈壁滩，蒙受风沙与寒冷的袭击，从来没有怨言。
    苏长福并没有满足已经取得的成绩。现在，他又向自治区党委提出争取1960年原车发动机延长到六十万公里无大修、发动机经过一次总修后，争取达到一百万公里无大修的计划。这个跃进的指标充分表现了苏长福不断革命的气概和勇往直前的精神。
