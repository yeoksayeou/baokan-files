    In Turkey	  Painting by Fang Cheng
    Although the cities are old, they possess modern scenery.
    Although people don't have the opportunity to read Turkish, there are many opportunities to learn foreign languages.
    Although they all wear veils, their eyes are very expressive.
    Although they are distant guests, everyone who looks at them sees them as hosts.

    虽然城市古老，可是具有现代化的风景。
    虽然人们没有机会读土耳其文，可是学外国文的机会却不少。
    虽然都戴着面纱，可是她们的眼睛却很有表情。
    虽然是远客，可是谁瞧着都像主人
