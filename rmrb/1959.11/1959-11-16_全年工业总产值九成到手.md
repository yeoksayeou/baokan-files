Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The State Statistical Bureau's data indicates that due to the more extensive and in-depth unfolding of the mass movement against right-leaning tendencies, to boost morale, and increase production while practicing economy, all fronts of industrial and transportation production and construction continue to leap forward in October. In this month, industrial production and transportation maintained a steady upward trend, further laying a reliable foundation for completing the annual plan ahead of schedule and exceeding targets. The construction and installation speed of key projects accelerated; a vigorous mass short-distance transportation campaign unfolded, with a surge in transport volume; the market was prosperous, and commodity purchases and sales were booming.

In October, the total industrial output value increased by 24% compared to the previous month; the cumulative total from January to October increased by 48.9% compared to the same period last year, completing 90.5% of the annual plan. The output of major products rose steadily every ten days. Compared with the previous month, steel increased by 19.9%, pig iron increased by 17.7%, raw coal increased by 3.9%, and the output value of the machinery industry increased by 28%. The national industrial (excluding commune industry) output value of consumer goods also increased by 17%. The cumulative output from January to October compared with the same period last year showed steel increased by 70%, pig iron increased by 105.8%, and raw coal increased by 58.3%. Among the remaining thirty-six products, nine, including electricity, refined washed coal, crude oil, and alcohol, increased by more than 50%; seventeen, including sulfuric acid, caustic soda, chemical fertilizers, cement, timber, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, paper and paperboard, and sugar, increased by 20% to 50%. The above figures indicate that all industrial sectors are continuing to leap forward; these figures also indicate that the ratio of production materials to consumer goods is appropriate.

As of the end of October, eleven major products, including metal cutting machine tools, generators, power station boilers, freight cars, and chemical fertilizers, had completed and exceeded their 1959 annual production plans. Timber and power machinery are also close to completing their annual plans.

With the further development of the mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement and the labor emulation campaign, workers' labor productivity continues to increase. According to statistics from nineteen provinces and cities, the average output value per employee in industrial enterprises in October increased by 13% compared to the previous month and 25% compared to the same period last year.

The amount of investment completed in national capital construction in October increased by 14.2% compared to the previous month, setting a record for the highest amount of investment completed in a single month this year. The cumulative investment completed from January to October increased by 14.5% compared to the same period last year. Under the guidance of the central government's policy of ensuring key projects, the construction progress of key projects planned to be put into production this year has been greatly accelerated. In October, a total of sixty above-quota construction projects were fully or partially completed and put into production (eight fully completed and put into production), an increase of five compared to September. Cumulatively from January to October, a total of three hundred and thirty above-quota projects were fully or partially completed and put into production. Many key projects shortened the construction period and were put into production ahead of schedule.

While ensuring key projects, construction departments at all levels have also made necessary arrangements for small and medium-sized construction projects. According to statistics from fifteen provinces (cities) autonomous regions and the Ministry of Railways, from the beginning of the year to the end of October, more than thirteen thousand below-quota construction projects have been completed or put into use.

The competition movement for high quality, high efficiency, low cost, and safety carried out in construction and installation has achieved remarkable results. Workers' labor productivity has generally increased. According to statistics from nineteen regions, including Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, and Jilin, the average amount of work completed by each construction and installation worker in October increased by 16.4% compared to the previous month and 20.4% compared to the same period last year. The quality of projects in many regions has significantly improved, casualties have been greatly reduced, and project costs have gradually decreased.

The national freight volume in October increased by 10.8% compared to the previous month and 55.4% compared to the same period last year. The cumulative total from January to October increased by 59.4% compared to the same period last year.

Since the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued instructions to launch a mass short-distance transportation movement, this movement has been launched throughout the country. According to preliminary statistics from twenty-one provinces and autonomous regions, in October, more than 3.5 million various animal-powered carts and freight tricycles, nearly 100,000 wooden sailing ships, and 480,000 pack animals participated in short-distance transportation. The national short-distance freight volume in October increased by 11% compared to the previous month and 64% compared to the same period last year, which fully demonstrates the great power of the Party's "walking on two legs" policy. However, because the current national economy is in a comprehensive leap forward, transportation has not yet met the needs of the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Therefore, the mass movement of both long-distance and short-distance transportation needs to continue to be carried out in depth.

In October, the procurement of agricultural products, centered on grain, cotton, oil, and pigs, entered a climax, and the procurement progress was faster than in any previous year. The total value of agricultural product procurement by commercial departments increased by 41% compared to the previous month and doubled compared to the same period last year; the total value of industrial product procurement increased by 41% compared to the same period last year. Cumulatively from July to the end of October this year, the national grain procurement has completed 61% of the plan (grain year), while in previous years the same period only reached about 40%. The procurement volume of cotton in September and October accounted for 48% of the annual plan, while in previous years it could generally only complete about 40% of the annual plan.

The retail market situation in urban and rural areas was good in October, and the retail sales of social commodities increased by 1.6% compared to the previous month and 8.5% compared to the same period last year. The sales volume of major non-staple foods increased significantly compared to July and August.

    群众性反右倾、鼓干劲、增产节约运动威力大张
    全年工业总产值九成到手
    十月份产值比上月增24％　一至十月累计比去年同期增48.9％
    头十个月累计产量同去年同期比：钢增70％铁增105％煤增58％
    新华社15日讯　国家统计局的资料表明，10月份由于群众性的反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约运动更加广泛、深入地展开，工业、交通生产建设各条战线都继续跃进。在这一月中，工业生产、交通运输仍然保持稳步上升的趋势，为提前和超额完成全年计划进一步奠定了可靠的基础，重点工程建筑安装速度加快；群众性的短途运输蓬勃展开，运输量激增；市场繁荣，商品购销两旺。
    10月份，工业总产值比上月增长24％；1—10月份累计比去年同期增长48.9％，完成全年计划的90.5％。主要产品产量逐旬上升。和上月比较，钢增长19.9％，生铁增长17.7％，原煤增长3.9％，机械工业产值增长28％。全国工业（不包括公社工业）消费资料产值也增长了17％。1—10月份累计产量和去年同期比较，钢增长70％，生铁增长105.8％，原煤增长58.3％。其余三十六种产品中，电、精洗煤、原油、酒精等九种增长50％以上，硫酸、烧碱、化肥、水泥、木材、棉纱、棉布、纸和纸版、糖等十七种，增长20％到50％。上述这些数字表明各个工业部门都在继续跃进；这些数字也表明，生产资料和消费资料的比例是适当的。
    截至10月底止，已经有金属切削机床、发电机、电站用锅炉、货车、化肥等十一种主要产品完成和超额完成了1959年全年产量计划。木材和动力机械两种也接近完成全年计划。
    随着群众性的技术革新、技术革命运动和劳动竞赛的进一步开展，工人劳动生产率不断提高。据十九个省、市的统计，10月份工业企业平均每一职工产值比上月提高13％，比去年同期提高25％。
    10月份全国基本建设完成的投资额比上月增长14.2％，创今年以来每月完成投资额的最高纪录。1—10月份累计完成的投资额，比去年同期增长了14.5％。在中央提出的保证重点的方针指导下，今年计划投入生产的重点工程的施工进度大大加快。10月份全部和部分建成投入生产的限额以上建设项目共有六十个（全部建成投入生产的八个），比9月份增加五个。1—10月份累计，全部和部分建成投入生产的限额以上项目达三百三十个。许多重点工程缩短工期提前投入了生产。
    在确保重点工程的同时，各级建设部门对中小型建设项目也作了必要的安排。根据十五个省（市）自治区和铁道部的统计，自年初到10月底，已建成或交付使用的限额以下建设项目有一万三千多个。
    建筑施工方面开展的优质量、高效率、低成本、保安全的竞赛运动，取得了显著成效。工人劳动生产率普遍提高，据北京、河北、山西、辽宁、吉林等十九个地区的统计，10月份平均每一建筑安装工人完成工作量比上月提高16.4％，比去年同期提高20.4％。很多地区的工程质量显著提高，伤亡事故大大减少，工程成本逐步降低。
    10月份全国货运量比上月增长10.8％，比去年同期增长55.4％，1—10月份累计，比去年同期增长59.4％。
    自从党中央和国务院发出开展群众性短途运输运动指示后，这一运动就在全国开展起来了。据二十一个省、自治区的初步统计，10月份参加短途运输的各种畜力车和货运人力车达三百五十多万辆，木帆船近十万艘，驮力四十八万头。10月份全国短途运输货运量比上月增长11％，比去年同期增长64％，这充分显示了党的“两条腿走路”方针的巨大威力。但是，由于当前国民经济正处在全面跃进中，交通运输还没有满足工农业生产持续跃进的需要。因此，不管长途运输或者短途运输的群众运动还需要继续深入开展。
    10月份以粮、棉、油、猪为中心的农产品收购运动进入高潮，收购进度比任何一年都快。商业部门的农产品收购总值比上月增长41％，比去年同期增加一倍；工业品收购总值比去年同期增长41％。自今年7月到10月底累计，全国粮食收购已完成计划（粮食年度）的61％，而往年同期只达40％左右。棉花9、10两个月收购量为年计划的48％，而往年同期一般只能完成年计划的40％左右。
    10月份城乡零售市场情况良好，社会商品零售额比上月增长1.6％，比去年同期增加8.5％。主要副食品的销售量比7、8月份增加很多。
