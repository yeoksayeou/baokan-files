Xinhua News Agency report: While the U.S. imperialists are instigating the Sananikone clique to expand the civil war in Laos, they are vigorously expanding and building many military ports, bases, highways, and other military facilities in South Vietnam. U.S. warships illegally enter and leave South Vietnamese ports, transporting war materials and U.S. military personnel.

On October 29, Colonel Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Mission of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army, wrote to the International Commission in Vietnam, requesting it to stop these illegal activities of the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities as soon as possible and to carry out more rigorous supervision.

The letter described the situation of the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities expanding naval bases in South Vietnam, and attached a map showing the expansion of naval bases in South Vietnam.

The letter pointed out that at the time of the ceasefire, South Vietnam only had two naval ports with simple facilities: Nha Trang and Da Nang. To date, these two seaports have not only been built or expanded into large-scale naval bases, but many other seaports in South Vietnam have also been developed into naval bases.

The letter stated that in 1958 alone, the United States spent 53 million yuan (South Vietnamese currency) to build the Saigon and Nha Trang seaports. Many warehouses and large docks have been added to the ports of Saigon, Thi Nghe (north of Saigon port), and Nha Be. At the same time, the highway from Nha Trang to Saigon has also been greatly expanded, allowing the United States to quickly and conveniently transport military supplies directly from the Nha Trang pier to the center of military bases.

The letter said that the Da Nang-Hoi An area is also regarded by the United States as one of the most important naval bases in South Vietnam. Before the Royal Lao Government launched the civil war, many warehouses and docks were repaired and added here. When the pro-American government in Laos created a civil war in Laos, these docks became the activity center of the U.S. Navy, transporting war materials into the Kingdom of Laos through the routes from Kontum to Attapeu (Lower Laos), or from Da Nang to Dong Ha into Central Laos.

The letter pointed out that the Tien Sa port belonging to Son Tra Island (ten kilometers east of Da Nang) has also been deepened, and many large docks have been built, allowing warships of more than 6,000 tons to berth. Vung Tau seaport has also become a large military port today, connecting with the Saigon and Nha Trang naval bases through the expanded Highway 15. The Nha Be and Qui Nhon seaport areas were only small ports in the past, but now some landing ports have been built. This has not only become a military port, but also a center for training the navy under the command of the United States.

The letter stated that it is worth noting that the United States is also focusing on studying the situation in the area from Vinh Luu to Da Yak and Cam Ranh Bay in order to build it into a large-scale naval base.

The letter pointed out that facts have proved that U.S. imperialism is turning South Vietnam into a military base in the U.S. military aggression plan in Southeast Asia and Indochina.

The letter stated that the People's Army Liaison Delegation believes that the establishment of these naval bases in South Vietnam is a serious violation of the Geneva Accords. If this behavior is allowed to continue, that is, allowing U.S. imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities to continue preparing for war, the danger of threatening peace in this region will become increasingly serious.

In another letter to the International Commission, the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army protested against the illegal entry and transportation of seven U.S. military officers, many U.S. soldiers, and a large number of U.S. war materials into South Vietnam in late July.

The letter revealed that these U.S. soldiers and weapons were transported to many airports in South Vietnam in eight batches.

The Liaison Delegation requested the International Commission to promptly investigate and draw conclusions on these actions that seriously violated the military provisions of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam.

In past letters to the International Commission, the Liaison Delegation has revealed that in the first three weeks of July, at least 37 U.S. military personnel, an unknown number of U.S. officers, and a large amount of war materials were illegally transported into South Vietnam by 15 U.S. aircraft and five U.S. and foreign ships.

    美国在南越加紧备战活动
    越南要求国际委员会制止美吴非法行径
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美帝国主义在加紧嗾使萨纳尼空集团扩大老挝内战的同时，正大力在南越扩建和修建许多军港、基地、公路和其它军事设施。美国军舰非法出入南越港口，运进战争物资和美国军事人员。
    10月29日，越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼大校写信给越南国际委员会，要求尽早制止美国和南越当局的这些非法活动，并进行更严密的监督。
    信中陈述美国和南越当局在南越扩建海军基地的情况，并附寄了南越扩建海军基地情况的地图。
    信中指出，刚停战时，南越只有设备简单的牙?和岘港两个军港。至今，这两个海港不但被修建或扩大为规模宏大的海军基地，而且南越其他许多海港也发展成为海军基地。
    信里说，仅在1958年，美国就用了五千三百万元（南越币）来修建西贡、牙?海港。西贡、市艺（西贡港北面）和牙元港口都增建了许多仓库、大码头。同时，从牙?到西贡的公路也大大地扩大了，让美国能够迅速和便利地从牙?码头把军用物资直接运到军事基地中心。
    信中说，岘港、会安区域也是被美国视为南越最重要的海军基地之一。在老挝王国政府发动内战之前，这里又修复和增建了许多仓库和码头。当老挝亲美政府在老挝制造内战时候，这些码头便成为美国海军的活动中心，通过昆嵩到阿速坡（下寮），或通过岘港到东河进入中寮的路线，把战争物资运入老挝王国。
    信中指出，属于山茶岛（岘港东面十公里）的仙车港口也已经挖深，并修建了许多大码头，使六千吨以上的战舰能够靠岸。头顿海港今天也变成一个大军港，它通过已经扩建了的第十五号公路同西贡、牙?海军基地连成一气，牙花、归仁海港区域过去只是一个小港口，如今已建筑了一些登陆口岸，这里不但变成一个军港，而且是由美国指挥的训练海军的中心。
    信里说，值得注意的是，美国还正在着重研究从咏驴到达约湾、和金兰湾的地区的情况，以便把它建成一个大规模的海军基地。
    信中指出，事实证明美帝国主义正在把南越变成美国在东南亚和印度支那地区的军事侵略计划中的军事基地。
    信中说，人民军联络代表团认为，在南越建立这些海军基地是严重违反日内瓦协议的行为。假如让这种行为继续下去，也就是让美帝国主义和南越当局继续准备战争，威胁这个地区和平的危险将日益严重。
    越南人民军总司令部联络代表团在写给国际委员会的另一封信中，抗议七名美国军官、许多美国军人和大量美国作战物资在7月下旬非法进入和运入南越。
    信中揭露，这些美国军人和武器是分作八次被运到南越的许多机场的。
    联络代表团要求国际委员会对这些严重破坏关于越南的日内瓦协议军事条款的行动迅速进行调查，并作出结论。
    联络代表团在过去给国际委员会的信件中就曾经揭露，在7月头三个星期内，至少有三十七名美国军事人员、数目不明的美国军官和大量作战物资，由十五架美国飞机和五艘美国及外国船只非法运入南越。
