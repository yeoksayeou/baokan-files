 本报讯　Chongqing (Our Newspaper) News: Chongqing's vast number of workers, facing rapid production development and insufficient power supply, actively implemented the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China's instruction to "vigorously generate electricity, practice strict conservation, adjust loads, and strictly dispatch," and launched a vigorous mass movement for electricity generation and conservation. Industrial and mining enterprises, government offices, and organizations throughout the city adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, quickly built over 5,000 kilowatts of generating equipment and put it into production, with another 6,000 kilowatts under active construction. In September and October, workers and residents saved 10 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. This played a significant role in overcoming weak links and ensuring the continued leap forward in production.

This year, Chongqing's electric power industry has greatly developed, with the capacity of generating equipment increasing by 34.7% compared to the same period last year. Recently, another twelve medium-sized power stations, each with a capacity of 1,500 kilowatts, have been put into production successively. However, the development of the electric power industry still cannot keep up with the needs of the city's rapid industrial development for power, becoming a prominent weak link. In response to this situation, at the beginning of October, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China made reasonable adjustments to the power supply and called on the workers and masses of the city to launch a movement for electricity generation and conservation. A high tide of electricity generation and conservation quickly appeared throughout the city. Workers in the light industry, chemical industry, and electromechanical industries put forward the slogan "Grasp electricity generation with one hand and production with the other," and actively developed power stations combining indigenous and foreign methods. In just one month, they built over 3,000 kilowatts of generating equipment. Among them, more than thirty factories in the light industry system now generate more than 170,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity every day, achieving 50% self-sufficiency.

In the process of vigorously developing mass electricity generation, many units tried every means to overcome the difficulties of insufficient equipment and technical strength. To solve the problem of power generation equipment, some units actively tapped internal potential or adjusted resources with other units. They used old diesel engines, steam boilers, motors, etc. for modification. The workers of the Sanlian Diesel Engine Factory worked hard for several days and nights to modify an old automobile engine into a gas engine and repaired a 30-kilowatt generator, generating electricity in less than ten days. Electrical machinery factories manufactured complete sets of small-scale power generation equipment. The Water Turbine Factory and others also cooperated with people's communes to build small hydropower stations. Factories cultivated a large number of technical personnel through short-term training courses and visits to other factories. The Electromechanical Industry Bureau organized "mobile medical teams" to help solve various technical problems and impart technology.

While vigorously grasping electricity generation, various units also vigorously carried out technical revolution and various measures to launch an electricity conservation movement. Textile factories used steam engines and diesel engines to directly drive looms and cotton gins. Printing and dyeing factories saved electric drying machines and used sunlight to dry cloth, greatly saving electricity consumption. The Xiyuan Electrical Machinery Factory converted two electric baking ovens into coal baking ovens, saving 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity per hour for each oven.

This vigorous mass movement for electricity generation and conservation, from power generation to power consumption, from industrial and mining enterprises to government offices and residents, has ensured the further leap forward of the city's industrial production. Some cadres in some light industrial factories initially advocated "determining production based on electricity" and reducing plans. Under the slogan of "Guarantee production by generating electricity," they actively carried out electricity generation and conservation movements and achieved a double leap forward in electricity generation and production. According to the power supply situation, the total output value of the Daming Textile Factory in October could only complete 54.2% of that in September. However, the entire factory, from leaders to the masses, actively participated in the movement of electricity generation, conservation, and substitution, ensuring the normal operation of 50% to 100% of the equipment, and exceeded the production level of September one day and two hours ahead of schedule.

 本报讯　Chongqing (Our Newspaper) News: Chemical factories in Chongqing have launched a high tide of vigorously developing small indigenous groups and small foreign groups. At present, the city's chemical industry has built more than 2,000 sets of indigenous equipment and equipment combining indigenous and foreign methods. This batch of indigenous equipment and equipment combining indigenous and foreign methods has played a great role in production.

At present, the number of chemical products produced by indigenous equipment and equipment combining indigenous and foreign methods in the city has reached about 500. Many basic chemical raw materials and chemical reagents, such as sulfuric acid, acetone, natural gas chlorination products, ion exchange resins, calcium carbide, sulfonamides, and glacial acetic acid, which were originally produced in very small quantities or never produced in the city, can now be produced locally and partially self-supplied. Due to the expansion of the production of basic chemical raw materials, the total output value and product output of the city's chemical industry have continued to increase. In the entire industry, the output value that indigenous equipment and equipment combining indigenous and foreign methods have already produced and plan to produce this year can reach one-third of the total output value, which can increase the national chemical products by 100 million yuan, becoming a new force in the city's chemical industry production.

The acetone and dichloropropanol needed by the Chongqing Plastics Factory were originally supported by other places, and production was often affected due to insufficient supply. It was necessary to add a complete set of foreign equipment, which would require a large amount of steel and a considerable amount of funds. The secretary of the factory's Party committee went deep into the workshop and worked with workers and technicians to study and experiment with extracting acetone from alcohol. They used scrap steel and old materials to build a workshop combining indigenous and foreign methods with an annual output of 120 tons of acetone, meeting the needs of acetone raw materials. When the Chongqing Tire Factory had not yet officially started construction, the employees worked together to build a batch of thatched shed factories and manufactured a batch of indigenous machines and wooden cutting machines, forming machines, and rubber mixing equipment combining indigenous and foreign methods, producing tires and rubber products in large quantities. In September of this year, the entire factory completed the annual plan one quarter ahead of schedule, producing more than 4,300 automobile tires for the country, while producing more than 1,800 other tires and a large number of rubber products, and also turned over one million yuan in profits to the country.

    土洋结合增产电力和化工产品
    重庆开展群众性办电运动保证工业生产继续跃进
    化工系统增加土洋结合的设备制出了一批新产品
    本报讯　重庆广大职工在生产飞跃发展、电力供应不足的情况下，积极执行中共重庆市委“大力办电、厉行节约、调整负荷、严格调度”的指示，掀起了轰轰烈烈的办电、节电的群众运动。全市的工矿企业、机关、团体采取土洋结合的办法，很快建起发电设备五千多瓩投入了生产，另有六千多瓩正在积极建设中；9、10两个月中，广大职工和居民还节约了一千万度电。这对克服薄弱环节，保证生产的继续跃进起了很大的作用。
    今年重庆市的电力工业有了很大的发展，发电设备的容量比去年同期增长了34.7％。最近，又有十二座每座容量一千五百瓩的中型电站陆续投入生产。但是，电力工业的发展仍然跟不上全市工业飞跃发展对动力的需要，成为突出的薄弱环节。针对这个情况，10月初，中共重庆市委一面将电力供应作了合理的调整，一面号召全市职工群众展开办电节电的运动。全市很快出现了热火朝天的办电、节电高潮。轻工、化工和机电工业职工提出“一手抓办电，一手抓生产”的口号，积极发展土洋结合的电站，短短的一个月中就建成了三千多瓩的发电设备。其中轻工业系统的三十多个工厂现在每天发电量在十七万度以上，已经做到了50％自给。
    在大搞群众性办电的过程中，很多单位都千方百计地克服了设备和技术力量不足的困难。为了解决发电设备问题，有的单位积极挖掘内部潜力或与别的单位互相调剂。他们利用旧柴油机、蒸汽锅炉、马达等进行改装。三联柴油机厂职工奋战了几昼夜，将一台旧汽车引擎改装成煤气机，还修复了一台三十瓩的发电机，不到十天就发出了电；电机工业各厂制造了成套的小型发电设备；水轮机厂等还与人民公社合作建设小型水力发电站。各厂通过短期训练班、去别厂参观实习等方式，培养了大批技术人材。机电工业局组织了“巡回医疗队”，一面帮助解决各种技术问题，一面传授技术。
    各单位在大抓办电的同时，还大闹技术革命，大搞各种措施，开展节电运动。纺织厂利用蒸汽机、柴油机直接带动织布机和梳棉机。印染厂节约了电力烘干机，改用阳光晒布，大大节约了用电量。西原电机厂将两台电烘炉改为煤烘炉，每台每小时就能节约一百度电。
    这个从发电到用电、从工矿企业到机关居民的轰轰烈烈的办电节电的群众运动，保证了全市工业生产进一步的跃进。有些轻工业工厂的部分干部开始还主张“以电定产”，削减计划，在“办电保生产”的口号下，经过积极开展办电节电运动，获得了办电、生产双跃进。大明纺织厂按照电力供应情况，10月份生产总值只能完成9月份的54.2％，但全厂从领导到群众都积极投入办电节电代电的运动，保证了50％到100％的设备运行正常，提前一天零二小时超过了9月份的生产水平。
    本报讯　重庆市各化工厂掀起了大搞小土群和小洋群的热潮。目前，全市化工行业已建起两千多套土设备和土洋结合的设备。这批土设备和土洋结合的设备在生产中发挥了很大作用。
    目前，全市用土设备和土洋结合的设备生产的化工产品已达到五百种左右，原来全市产量很小或从不生产的硫酸、丙酮、天然气氯化产品、离子交换树脂、电石、磺胺、冰醋酸等许多化工基本原料和化学试剂，现在都能就地生产和部分自给。由于基本化学原料生产的扩大，全市化工行业的总产值和产品产量不断增加。在整个行业中，今年土设备和土洋结合的设备已经生产和计划生产的产值可达到总产值的三分之一，约可为国家增加一亿元化工产品，成了全市化学工业生产中的一支新生力量。
    重庆塑料厂需要的丙酮和二氯丙醇，原都依靠外地支援，常因供应不上而影响生产。需要添置一整套洋设备，要用大量钢材和不小的一笔资金。这个厂的党委书记就深入车间和工人、技术人员一道研究，试验从酒精中提炼丙酮。他们利用废钢材、旧料建成了一个年产一百二十吨丙酮的土洋结合的车间，满足了丙酮原料需要。重庆轮胎厂在没有正式开始建设时，职工们即群策群力建起一批茅草棚厂房，制造了一批土机器和土洋结合的木质切胶机、成型机、炼胶设备，大批生产轮胎和胶制品。今年9月份全厂已提前一个季度完成了全年计划，为国家生产了四千三百多件汽车轮胎，同时生产了其他车胎一千八百多条和大批胶制品，还上交给国家一百万元利润。
