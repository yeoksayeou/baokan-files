The picture on the left shows the scene of the construction of the Huinü Reservoir. The reservoir is in Hui'an County, Fujian Province. Why is it called "Huinü Reservoir" instead of "Hui'an Reservoir"? There is a story full of tears and laughter behind it.

For thousands of years, the women of Hui'an County have not only suffered the same cruel exploitation and oppression from the ruling class as men, and the disasters of storms, droughts, and sandstorms, but also the shackles of various feudal customs, living an unbearable and painful life. At that time, the "gods" and the feudal patriarchs, clan chiefs, and husbands dominated their fate. When a daughter was to be married, she would be starved for seven days in her parents' home (only drinking a little thin sweet potato soup). Then, wearing decorations weighing six or seven catties or even more than ten catties on her head, and covered with a black veil, she would be carried to her husband's house in a daze. The bride would stand in her husband's house for three days and three nights before returning to her parents' home. After suffering such torture, the young and innocent girls regarded returning to their husband's house as entering the eighteenth level of hell and never wanted to go back. And the men? In the world where feudal authority ruled women, they regarded beating their wives as their "glory." In the eastern coastal areas of Hui'an, such feudal customs prevailed: during festivals, women would return to their husband's homes for one or two days. If they were not pregnant, they would live in their parents' homes for the rest of their lives. The fate of widows was even more tragic. Remarrying for a widow was considered "ruining the family reputation" and "insulting the ancestors." No matter how old they were when their husbands died, they could not remarry. If a widow fell in love with someone else, the clan chief had the right to execute her.

The women of Hui'an, who were deeply persecuted by feudal forces, also suffered the humiliation of local tyrants, evil gentry, puppet village representatives, puppet bailiffs, and local ruffians... during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Under layers of oppression, the women had nowhere to express their grief and nowhere to pour out their bitterness. In despair, they could only discuss a way out in twos and threes: some shaved their heads and became nuns, some hanged themselves, and some jumped into ponds or the sea in groups of four, five, or even a dozen.

In August ten years ago, Hui'an was liberated, and the women of Hui'an raised their heads for the first time and participated in the struggle alongside men. The reactionary regime was overthrown, and the bullies who rode on the people's heads and bullied women were suppressed. The vigorous mass movement of land reform destroyed the feudal marriage system built on the foundation of the feudal land economy. The People's Government promulgated the Marriage Law, and the freedom of marriage for men and women was guaranteed by law. The four ropes of "political power," "clan power," "divine power," and "husband power" that had bound women for a long time were cut off. Lin Xiling of Liu厝 Village was forced into marriage by her parents at the age of sixteen and became a widow at the age of seventeen. After liberation, she fell in love with the poor peasant Liu Ali in the labor force. The clan chief, representing the remnants of feudal clan power, did not allow them to marry. Under the pretext of "ruining the family reputation," he beat Lin Xiling black and blue, put her in handcuffs and shackles, and locked her in a dark room. After learning about this situation, Liu Ali immediately appealed to the district people's government at the time. The Party and the government immediately sent people to rescue Lin Xiling, who had been imprisoned for three days and three nights, and dealt with the most stubborn feudal clan chief. The county party secretary and county head also reported this incident at a county-wide cadre meeting, mobilizing the people of the county to support the struggle of Lin Xiling and Liu Ali. In April 1950, they finally got married with the support of the Party and the assistance of the masses.

Now, the women of Hui'an are working side by side with men in the cause of socialist construction and in the people's commune movement. In the family, they are full of love and warmth, which encourages them to build their motherland with full enthusiasm and build a better life in the future. In this era of the Great Leap Forward, in the days of infinite joy for the women of Hui'an, the Huinü Reservoir began construction. Women laborers account for more than 90% of this reservoir, so it is called Huinü Reservoir. The women of Hui'an County, in the place where their sisters and sisters-in-law collectively jumped into ponds and the sea in those years, buried that tragic era with their hands and built a large reservoir. This reservoir stores more than 10 million cubic meters of water than the Ming Tombs Reservoir. While working, they cheerfully sing:

Who turned the Huinü over?
Who saved the most suffering people?
The Communist Party and Chairman Mao,
Your kindness is as deep as a mountain and deeper than the sea.
There is nothing to repay you,
Only a fiery heart!

    惠女水库的故事
    祝平
    左面这幅画，是建设惠女水库的场景。水库在福建省惠安县，为什么不叫“惠安水库”而叫“惠女水库”？其中有一段充满了眼泪和欢笑的故事。
    惠安县的妇女，千百年来，不但和男子同样受着统治阶级残酷的剥削和压迫，受着暴风、干旱和风沙的灾害，而且受着各种封建陋俗的束缚，过着难以忍受的痛苦生活。那时，主宰她们的命运的是“神”，是封建的家长、族长和丈夫。女儿要出嫁了。在娘家先饿上七天（只喝一点点稀地瓜汤），然后头上戴着六、七斤甚至十几斤重的装饰，再蒙上一块黑纱，昏昏沉沉地被抬到婆家。新娘在婆家站上三天三夜回娘家了。年幼纯洁的女孩子，受了这样的折磨，从此把回婆家看成是进十八层地狱，再也不愿回去。而男人呢？在封建夫权统治着妇女的天地里，把捆打妻子看成是自己的“光荣”。在惠安东部沿海一带盛行着这样的封建陋俗：逢年过节，妇女回婆家住上一两天，如果没有怀孕，便要在娘家住一辈子。寡妇的命运就更悲惨。寡妇改嫁是“败坏门风”“有辱祖宗”的事。不论多大年岁死了丈夫，都不能改嫁。如果寡妇与别人发生爱情，族长就有处死她的权利。
    深受封建势力迫害的惠安妇女，在国民党反动统治时期，还要受那些土豪劣绅、伪乡代表、伪保长、地痞流氓……的凌辱。在层层的压迫下，妇女的悲伤无处诉，苦水无处吐。她们在绝望的时候，只有三三两两一起商量出路：有的削发为尼，有的上吊，有的便四、五个甚至十几个一齐跳潭、跳海。
    十年前的8月里，惠安解放了，惠安的妇女第一次抬起头来，和男子一起参加了斗争。反动政权被打垮了，骑在人民头上、欺凌妇女的恶霸被镇压了；轰轰烈烈的土地改革的群众运动，把建筑在封建土地经济基础上的封建婚姻制度摧垮了；人民政府公布了婚姻法，男女的婚姻自由得到了法律上的保障。长期以来捆着妇女的“政权”“族权”“神权”“夫权”的四根绳子被铰断了。刘厝村的林西玲十六岁由父母包办结婚，十七岁守寡。解放后，在劳动中和贫农刘阿礼产生了爱情。代表封建族权残余势力的族长不允许他们结婚，以“败坏门风”为名，把林西玲打得遍体鳞伤，上了手铐脚镣，关进暗房。刘阿礼知道这一情况后，立即到当时的区人民政府申诉了。党和政府马上派人救出了已被关押了三天三夜的林西玲，处理了最顽固的封建族长。县委书记和县长，还把这件事在全县干部会上作了报告，动员全县人民支持林西玲、刘阿礼的斗争。1950年4月，他们终于在党的支持和群众的赞助下结婚了。
    现在，惠安妇女在社会主义建设事业中，在人民公社化运动中，同男子们并肩劳动。在家庭里，又是这样充满了爱情和温暖，这一切都激励着她们满腔热情地建设自己的祖国，建设将来更美好的生活。就在这大跃进的年代，在惠安妇女无限欢欣的日子，惠女水库开工了。这个水库妇女劳动力占90％以上，所以叫惠女水库。惠安县的妇女们，在她们的姊妹姑嫂们当年集体跳潭跳海的地方，用双手埋葬了那个悲惨的岁月，建立了大水库。这个水库比十三陵水库还多蓄一千多万立方水。她们一面劳动，一面愉快地歌唱着：
    谁使惠女翻了身？
    谁救了受苦最深的人？
    共产党呀毛主席，
    恩情如山比海深。
    没有东西报答您，
    只有一颗火热的心！
