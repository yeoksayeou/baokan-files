    The Willows are Green Again
    Mei Lanfang

    When I was young, I often heard the older generation say that before the Four Great Anhui Troupes entered Beijing and the tunes of Peking Opera became popular, the popular tunes in China were Southern Kunqu, Northern Yiyang, Eastern Willow, and Western Bangzi. I started learning Kunqu from a young age. Yiyang originated in Jiangxi and later evolved into Gaoqiang, which spread widely and was once popular on the Beijing stage. Bangzi, from Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, and other places, is an even more common opera genre. Only "Willow Tune" I have never seen. There is a Peking Opera called "Little Grave Visit," which is said to be Willow Tune, accompanied by flute, lyrics in seven characters, a Huadan playing Xiao Su-zhen, emphasizing waist and leg skills, and a robed clown playing Liu Lu-jing, with many dance movements. This is originally a comedy that expresses the joy and sorrow of a husband and wife's reunion through song and dance. When I was on stage with Wang Huifang, he played this play. The clown playing Liu Lu-jing was Wang Xiuyun. When Liu Lu-jing heard Xiao Su-zhen say that Li Er-gong had persuaded her to remarry, he had four lines, the last two of which were "The Emperor has bestowed upon me the Shangfang Sword, and I will surely cut off heads without mercy," carrying a strong Shandong accent. At that time, I talked to an old gentleman about it, and he said that Liu Lu-jing in "Little Grave Visit" was said to be a shadow of Liu Tongxun, the father of the Qing Dynasty calligrapher Liu Yong. Liu was from Zhucheng, Shandong, so he used Willow Tune to sing. Apart from this play, I couldn't find any trace of "Eastern Willow," and I always thought this opera genre had been lost. This time, from the several performances of the Shandong Province Liuzi Opera, Liangjiaxian, and Liuqiang joint performance troupe, I saw Liuzi Opera and felt very excited.

    The Liuzi Opera "Sun An Presents the Memorial" tells the story of: During the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, the powerful Prime Minister Zhang Cong embezzled funds and massacred laborers. Sun An, the prefect of Caozhou, presented a memorial impeaching him. The young Emperor, believing Zhang Cong's slander, had Sun An flogged forty times in the court. Sun An discovered in his father-in-law Huang Yide's house that his father had also been killed for impeaching Zhang Cong. Indignant, he bound his wife and son, carried a coffin, and appealed with his corpse. As a result, Zhang Cong slandered him again, and he was pushed to the execution ground at noon. Huang Yide sought the help of veteran official Shen Li to protect him, but was refused. Finally, he invited Duke Dingguo Xu Long, who wielded the Black Tiger Copper Hammer and struck the Golden Palace. The Emperor had no choice but to pardon Sun An. This play vividly expresses the simple desire of the working people to use loyalty to control the treacherous and uphold justice.

    Huang Zunxian, who plays Sun An, plays the role of a Laosheng (old male role) based on his foundation as a Wusheng (male martial role). He can act and sing, demonstrating great skill. In the scene of writing the memorial, when Sun An reads Huang Yide's "Xi Jiang Yue" poem advising him to protect himself wisely, and the many files of officials who were killed for impeaching Zhang Cong that were deliberately placed on the desk, the complex ideological struggle of Sun An is portrayed in layers and step by step. This scene lasts for an hour, but it does not feel lengthy. Zhang Xingcheng, who plays Huang Yide, vividly portrays the cautious expression of a slippery old bureaucrat who has experienced the ups and downs of officialdom. He Dongming's Xu Long has exquisite facial makeup and a distinct personality. Compared with Chang Baotong's role in the Peking Opera "Beating Yan Song," he has a different style. It is said that this play had been lost and was recently excavated. Both the old artists and new literary workers have made great contributions, which is gratifying.

    Zhang Chunlei, an old artist known as the "Living Zhang Fei" for his good performance in "Zhang Fei Breaks into the Camp," plays Qin Qiong in "Huangsang Inn." His singing and recitation are calm and powerful, and his movements are steady and experienced. Qin Qiong despises Luo Zhou, who is escorting him, but also leaves room for maneuver, portraying the true nature of a brave and careful hero. Li Yongxiu, who plays Luo Zhou, is a famous Xiaosheng (young male role) in Liuzi Opera, with excellent skills, and is evenly matched with Zhang Chunlei. For example, Luo Zhou feigns sincerity to Qin Qiong and says, "I have good words to tell you." Qin Qiong replies, "I am not afraid of bad words." Also, when Qin Qiong enters the Huangsang Inn and sees that Luo Zhou has bad intentions, he bows his back and says, "Good you Luo Zhou, you want to stay in a shop before it gets dark, there must be a reason. Hmm! I have my own way..." and then asks the shopkeeper to put the double maces outside the door to attract customers, foreshadowing Shi Danai coming to rescue him later. These actions are all delicate and vivid. The long singing section after he wakes up in the inn highlights Qin Qiong's strong character. When he sees that the shopkeeper is giving him Luo Zhou's leftovers, he kicks the table over. From this movement, I am reminded of Qin Erye's spirited look in the Peking Opera "Selling the Horse" when he opens his eyes as soon as the shopkeeper says the meal is ready. Comparing the two is very interesting. In those years, I often watched Mr. Tan Xinpei perform "Selling the Horse." His playful dialogue with the shopkeeper emphasized the artistic conception of "a hero being frustrated and bullied by villains." The section in Xipi when selling the horse was desolate and poignant, making people reminisce endlessly. After seeing Shan Xiongxin, he immediately showed a happy expression of meeting someone he had known for a long time and who shared the same temperament, portraying a person who worked in the government but had the temperament of a Liangshan hero. The plot of "Huangsang Inn" is similar to that of the Peking Opera "Three Family Inn." Peking Opera uses a Laosheng to play Qin Qiong, while Liuzi Opera uses a Hongjing (red-faced male role). Each has its own style. Qin Qiong's facial makeup in Huangsang Inn is painted with red three tiles, simple and unadorned, similar to the style of the Zhao Kuangyin facial makeup from the Ming Dynasty that I have collected. From Qin Qiong's facial makeup, you can see the age of this opera genre.

    "Playing at the Boat Race" depicts Bai Yuejuan and the scholar Xiao Wenqin meeting at the Dragon Boat Festival and falling in love at first sight. Xiao Wenqin picks up Yuejuan's phoenix hairpin, and the maid Yunxia comes to look for it. Xiao returns the hairpin, gives a fan with a poem, moves Yuejuan, sends a letter asking to meet on the boat, and eventually they become a couple. The dance and singing in this play are beautiful and moving, and the basic skills of several young actors are good. Li Yanzhen, who plays Bai Yuejuan, Xu Fengyun, who plays Xiao Wenqin, and Yang Baorong, who plays Yunxia, speak clearly, and their steps and movements are accurate. In general love plays, women are often in a passive position, but Bai Yuejuan actively sends a letter asking Xiao Wenqin to come to the boat to meet, showing a character who boldly resists feudal ethics. At the same time, she gives the impression of being lively and vivid, without vulgar or low-grade characteristics. It can be seen that this play has undergone careful processing.

    Of the three plays above, only "Huangsang Inn" is sung in "Liuzi Tune," while the rest use various tunes such as "Qingyang Luoluo," "Wawa," "Luantan," "Shanpoyang," "Suonanzhi," "Zhuyunfei," "Jishengcao," and other folk songs and tunes. "Liuzi Opera" is a comprehensive local folk opera, and its characteristic is that it is good at absorbing and is not restricted by forms; therefore, it is easy to understand and has always been active in the area where Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu provinces meet, and is loved by the working people. In terms of music, it inherits the legacy of the stringed instrument tunes of the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, with Sanxian, Sheng, and Dizi as the main instruments, which are melodious and has a unique flavor. This ancient opera genre has reached a stage of innovation under the encouragement of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom." "Liuqiang" and "Liangjiaxian" are also famous folk tunes in Shandong, and this time they brought many wonderful plays, which were welcomed by the audience. Comrade Ma Shaobo has already written an article to introduce them, so I will not repeat them.

    东柳重青
    梅兰芳
    年青时常听老辈说，在四大徽班尚未进京，皮黄调未盛行前，中国流行的曲调，有南昆、北弋、东柳、西梆。昆腔我从幼年起就开始学唱的。弋阳腔发源于江西，后来演变为高腔，流播的区域很广，在北京舞台上也曾盛行过一个时期。陕西、山西、河北……梆子更是常见的剧种。只有“柳子腔”没有看到过。京剧里有一出“小上坟”，大家说是柳子腔，用笛子伴奏、唱词七字成文、花旦扮萧素贞，讲究腰腿蹻工，袍带丑扮刘禄景，舞蹈动作很多。这本是一出载歌载舞表达夫妻团圆悲喜交集的喜剧。我和王蕙芳同台时，他曾演过这个戏，扮刘禄景的丑角是王秀云，当刘禄景听到萧素贞说有李二公劝她改嫁时，他有四句唱词，后两句是“圣上赐我上方剑，定斩人头不容情”，带出很浓厚的山东口音。当时我和一位老先生谈起，他说，“小上坟”里的刘禄景，据说是影射清代书家刘墉的父亲刘统勋的，刘是山东诸城人，所以用柳子腔来唱。除这出戏以外，就再找不到“东柳”的痕迹，我一直以为这个剧种已经失传了。这次从山东省柳子戏、两夹弦、柳腔联合演出团的几次演出中，看到了柳子戏，感到十分兴奋。
    柳子戏“孙安动本”，故事是：明朝万历间宰相张从专权，吞没账款，屠杀民工，曹州知府孙安动本参劾，幼帝听信张从谗言，将孙安廷杖四十，孙安在岳父黄义德家中，发现他的父亲亦因参劾张从而被害，愤而绑妻缚子，舆榇尸谏，结果又被张从进谗，推出午门问斩。黄义德力求元老沈理保本不准，最后请来定国公徐龙，手执黑虎铜锤，打上金殿，皇帝只得赦了孙安。这个戏痛快淋漓地表达了劳动人民以忠制奸，伸张正义的朴素愿望。
    扮演孙安的黄遵宪，是从武生基础上演老生的。能做能唱，很见功力。写本一场，当孙安看了岳父黄义德劝他明哲保身的一首“西江月”，和故意摆在书桌上的许多因参劾张从被害的官员的档案，层次分明、步步深入地刻划出孙安的复杂的思想斗争，这场戏长达一小时之久，但不觉拖沓。扮黄义德的张兴成，形容一个圆滑的老官僚饱经宦海风波、小心翼翼的神情，非常逼真。何东明的徐龙，脸谱精致、性格鲜明，与京剧“打严嵩”的常宝童对比，另有一种风格。这个戏听说已经失传，最近才挖掘出来的，老艺人与新文艺工作者都有很大的贡献，令人可喜。
    以善演“张飞闯辕门”得名，有活张飞称号的老艺人张春雷，在“黄桑店”里扮秦琼，唱念沉着有气魄，身段老当稳练。秦琼蔑视押解他的罗舟，而又处处留有余地，刻划出一个胆大心细的英雄本色。扮罗舟的李永秀是柳子戏的名小生，工夫到家，与张春雷旗鼓相当，例如，罗舟对秦琼假意说：“我有好言对你讲。”秦琼答：“恶言我也不惧。”又如，秦琼进了黄桑店，看出罗舟心怀不测，他打“背躬”说：“好你罗舟，天还未黑就看店住宿，其中定有原故，嗯！我自有道理……。”就叫店家把双锏放在门外，招徕顾客，为后面史大奈来救他的伏笔，这些做派都细致生动。在店内睡醒后的大段唱工，很能突出秦琼的坚强性格。当他看到店家把罗舟的残菜给他吃时，他一脚把桌子踢翻。从这个身段中，我想起京剧“卖马”里秦二爷听到店主东说饭熟了就挣开眼的神气，两相对照，很有意思。当年我常看谭鑫培老先生演“卖马”，他和店主东开玩笑的对白，着重描写“英雄不得志，反被小人欺”的意境，卖马时一段西皮，苍凉感喟，令人回味无穷；见了单雄信后，立刻显出一见如故、气味相投的高兴神情，处处刻划出一个身在公门当差而具有绿林好汉的气质。“黄桑店”的情节，与京剧“三家店”相仿，京剧用老生扮秦琼，柳子戏用红净扮，各有风格。黄桑店里秦琼的脸谱是红三块瓦的勾法，简净古朴，与我所藏明代赵匡胤脸谱的风格很相似，从秦琼的脸谱上就可以看出这个剧种的年纪。
    “玩会跳船”，是描写白月娟与书生萧文勤在龙舟会上相遇，一见钟情，萧文勤拾得月娟的凤钗一只，侍女云霞赶来寻觅，萧还钗赠扇题诗，感动月娟，柬约跳船相会，终成百年之好。这个戏的舞蹈、唱腔，优美动人，几位青年演员的基本工夫都不错，扮白月娟的李艳珍，扮萧文勤的许凤云，扮云霞的杨宝荣，字眼清楚，步法、身段都有准地方。一般爱情小戏里，女子往往处于被动地位，而白月娟却主动地柬约萧文勤过船见面，表现出大胆反抗礼教的性格，同时给人的印象是活泼鲜明，而没有庸俗低级的气味，可以看出，这个戏是经过一番慎重加工的。
    上面三个戏，只有“黄桑店”唱的是“柳子腔”，其余是用各种曲牌调子如“青阳罗罗”、“娃娃”、“乱弹”、“山坡羊”、“锁南枝”、“驻云飞”、“寄生草”……等民歌小曲组成的。“柳子戏”是一种综合性的地方民间戏曲，它的特点是善于吸收，而不受格式的拘束；所以通俗易懂，一向活动于山东、河南、江苏三省交界的地方，为劳动人民所喜爱；音乐方面是继承元明间弦索调的余绪，以三弦、笙、笛为主要乐器，悠扬动听，别有风味。这个古老剧种在“百花齐放”的鼓舞下达到了推陈出新的地步；还有“柳腔”、“两夹弦”都是山东著名的民间曲调，这次带来许多精采剧目，受到观众的欢迎，马少波同志已经写文章介绍过，我不重复了。
