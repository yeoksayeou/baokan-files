Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Amidst the excellent situation of the continued leap forward of the entire national economy, a vigorous and down-to-earth agricultural product procurement campaign has formed a climax across the country on the finance and trade front. In order to push this campaign to a new stage and rapidly and comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill this year's agricultural product procurement tasks, the CCP Central Finance and Trade Department, the State Council Finance and Trade Office, and the Central People's Broadcasting Station jointly held the "National Agricultural Product Procurement Work Radio Conference" tonight.

The central venue of the radio conference was located in the CPPCC Auditorium. More than 1,500 people, including responsible cadres from the CCP Central Committee and the State Council's relevant finance and trade and agriculture departments, as well as advanced workers in finance and trade who are participating in the National Heroes Conference in Beijing, attended the conference. Party secretaries and governors of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in charge of finance and trade, finance and trade cadres and the broad masses of commune members of people's communes and production teams across the country, listened to the live broadcast of the conference.

Li Xiannian, member of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a speech at the conference entitled "Advance Victoriously, Make Persistent Efforts, and Fulfill and Overfulfill the Agricultural Product Procurement Task." (Speech to be issued separately)

The conference was presided over by Ma Mingfang, Minister of the CCP Central Finance and Trade Department. In his opening remarks, he said that this is a leap forward conference, a conference to review achievements, and a conference to further mobilize. The purpose is to push the agricultural product procurement campaign to a greater climax and complete and overfulfill the national agricultural product procurement task ahead of schedule. He said that the current situation of agricultural product procurement is very good. This year's procurement of grain, cotton, edible oil, and other agricultural products is earlier, faster, and better than in any previous year. Some provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, special districts, and counties have already completed the procurement tasks for grain and cotton. Everyone knows that the grain, cotton, and various agricultural products produced by the people's communes and farmers, in addition to leaving a portion for their own consumption and use, must be sold. As production increases, the portion to be sold becomes larger. This is because the people's communes need to obtain funds to buy back the means of production needed for expanded reproduction, increase public accumulation, and increase commune members' income. Farmers sell various agricultural products to the state, which provides raw materials for factories, commodities for the market, and export goods for the country. This also supports the country's industrialization and promotes the high-speed development of socialist construction, and promotes the early realization of agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification. Therefore, agricultural product procurement is an extremely important component of the entire national economy, and this work must be done well from beginning to end.

Subsequently, the responsible comrades of the Party committees of nine provinces and autonomous regions, including Hebei, Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Anhui, Jilin, Xinjiang, Hunan, and Shanxi, reported to the conference on the achievements and experiences gained in the agricultural product procurement campaign in these provinces and regions. They all said that this year's agricultural product procurement work has been done well, which is a victory for the Party's General Line, a victory for carrying out mass movements under the leadership of the Party, and a victory for the people's communes.

Xie Xuegong, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, said that the mass movement for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products centered on grain, cotton, and oil in Hebei Province has surpassed any previous year in terms of scale and speed of procurement. As of November 3, the province has overfulfilled the state's grain purchase task for this year. The vigorous development of the agricultural and sideline product procurement movement has powerfully promoted the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, guaranteed the needs of national construction and people's lives, and the market has shown a prosperous and thriving scene.

Li Dazhang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee and Governor of Sichuan Province, said that Sichuan Province had completed the annual grain purchase task two months ahead of schedule by the end of September. By the end of October, the cotton procurement task had been overfulfilled; the peanut procurement task had been completed by 71%; the cottonseed procurement task had been completed by 116.38%; and other oilseed procurements had also made great progress; the total amount of agricultural and sideline product procurement in the province had completed 85.6% of the annual task.

Xu Jiansheng, member of the Standing Committee of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee and Deputy Governor of Guizhou Province, said that as of October 31, the total procurement value of Guizhou Province, including grain and oil, had completed 86.87% of the annual plan; on October 8, it had overfulfilled this year's grain purchase plan four months ahead of schedule. Since mid-September, after the province formed a climax of autumn grain storage, the number of people involved in the movement reached more than two million every day, and at the highest time there were more than four million. When sending public grain, commune members sang: The red sun rises in the East, the whole party and the whole people are full of vigor, thousands of troops and horses shake the mountains and rivers, and they actively sell patriotic grain.

He Ximing, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee, said that by October 25, the total commercial procurement of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region had overfulfilled the annual plan by 1.3%; by October 31, it had overfulfilled the annual grain purchase task by 0.4%, the fastest, largest, and best grain purchase year in history.

Song Menglin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, said that while celebrating the large increase and bumper harvest in agriculture, the broad masses of farmers in Anhui Province expressed their sincere support for the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes with their practical actions of actively selling agricultural and sideline products to the state. So far, the province's grain purchase plan has been completed by 76.62%, the procurement volume of oilseeds and cotton has also increased compared with the same period last year, the tea procurement plan has been overfulfilled three months ahead of schedule, and the procurement volume of other agricultural and sideline products has also increased sharply.

Li Youwen, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee and Governor of Jilin Province, said in his speech that Jilin Province has organized seven assaults in the past two months and launched two upsurges in the production, collection, and procurement of agricultural, sideline, and special local products. By October 31, it had completed 104.7% of the annual procurement task two months ahead of schedule.

Today, the good news reporting teams organized by Gaocheng County and Xinle County in Hebei Province, and Chengguan People's Commune in Huairou County, Beijing, holding aloft production victory signs and big red flags for grain, cotton, pigs, eggs, fruits, and other agricultural products, came to the central venue with joy, adding to the warm atmosphere of the conference. The good news from Chengguan People's Commune in Huairou County said that in order to welcome the convening of today's radio conference, they had completed this year's grain purchase task two months ahead of schedule this morning.

The experience of Suixian County, Henan Province in achieving a complete success in the procurement, processing, and transportation of agricultural and sideline products, and Zheng Lianyu, the Party branch secretary of Liangjiatai Store in Qinglong County, Hebei Province, on behalf of all the representatives in the field of finance and trade attending the National Heroes Conference, were warmly welcomed by everyone.

During the three hours of the radio conference, commune members and finance and trade workers from all over the country who listened to the live broadcast of the conference made more than 600 long-distance calls and express telegrams to the central venue of the conference, expressing their willingness to respond to the call of the conference with practical actions of actively selling agricultural products.

    中共中央财贸部和国务院财贸办公室在广播大会上发出号召
    把农产品收购运动推向新阶段
    据新华社6日讯　在整个国民经济继续跃进的大好形势下，财贸战线上一个既轰轰烈烈、又踏踏实实的农产品收购运动已经在全国各地形成高潮。为了把这个运动推向新的阶段，迅速地、全面地完成和超额完成今年农产品收购任务，中共中央财贸部、国务院财贸办公室和中央人民广播电台今天晚上联合举办“全国农产品收购工作广播大会”。
    广播大会的中心会场设在政协礼堂，中共中央和国务院的财贸、农业各有关部门的负责干部和正在北京参加全国群英会的财贸方面的先进工作者等一千五百多人参加了大会。全国各省、市、自治区主管财贸工作的党委书记、省长，全国人民公社、生产队的财贸干部和广大社员群众，收听了大会的实况广播。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李先念以“乘胜前进，再接再厉，完成和超额完成农产品收购任务”为题在会上讲了话。（讲话另发）
    大会由中共中央财贸部部长马明方主持，他在致开幕词中说，这是一次跃进的大会，是一次检阅成绩的大会，是一次进一步动员的大会。目的是为了把农产品收购运动推向更大的高潮，提前完成和超额完成国家农产品收购任务。他说，目前农产品收购工作的形势很好，今年粮食、棉花、食油和其他农产品的收购，比过去任何一年都收得早、收得快、收得好。现在已经有一些省、市、自治区、专区、县完成了粮食、棉花的收购任务。大家都知道，人民公社和农民生产出来的粮食、棉花和各种农产品，除了留下自己吃的和用的一部分以外，其余部分都是要销售的。生产增加了，要销售的部分就越大。因为人民公社要取得资金，买回扩大再生产所需要的生产资料，要增加公共积累，增加社员收入。农民把各种农产品卖给国家，这样就使工厂得到原料，市场得到商品，国家得到出口物资，这也就是支援了国家的工业化，促进社会主义建设高速度地向前发展，促进农业机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化的早日实现。所以农产品收购工作，是整个国民经济中极为重要的一个组成部分，必须有始有终地把这一工作做好。
    接着，河北、四川、贵州、广西、安徽、吉林、新疆、湖南和山西等九个省、自治区的党委负责同志向大会报告了这些省、区农产品收购运动的成就和取得的经验。他们都说，今年农产品的收购工作做得好，这是党的总路线的胜利，是在党的领导下，大搞群众运动的胜利，是人民公社的胜利。
    中共河北省委书记处书记解学恭说，河北省以粮、棉、油为中心的农副产品收购的群众运动，其规模之大，收购进度之快，都超过了以往任何一年。到11月3日，已经超额完成了今年国家的粮食征购任务。农副产品收购运动的蓬勃发展，有力地促进了工农业生产的继续跃进，保证了国家建设和人民生活的需要，市场出现了一片欣欣向荣的兴旺景象。
    中共四川省委书记处书记、四川省省长李大章说，9月底四川省已经比往年提前两个月完成了全年的粮食征购任务。到10月底，棉花收购任务已经超额完成；花生的收购任务已经完成了71％；棉籽的收购任务已经完成了116.38％；其他的油料收购也有很大的进展；全省农副产品的收购总额，已经完成全年任务的85.6％。
    中共贵州省委常委、贵州省副省长徐健生说，截至10月31日止，贵州全省包括粮、油在内的采购总值已经完成年计划的86.87％；10月8日已经提前四个月超额完成了今年的粮食征购计划。从9月中旬，全省形成秋粮入库高潮以后，每天投入运动的人数达到二百多万人，最高的时候有四百多万人。公社社员在送公粮时唱道：东方升起红太阳，全党全民气昂昂，千军万马山河震，踊跃交售爱国粮。
    中共广西僮族自治区委员会书记处书记贺希明说，到10月25日，广西僮族自治区商业收购总额已经超额1.3％完成了全年计划；到10月31日，已经超额0.4％完成了全年粮食征购任务，为历年来粮食征购最快最多最好的一年。
    中共安徽省委书记处书记宋孟邻说，安徽省广大农民在欢庆农业大增产、大丰收的同时，都以积极向国家交售农副产品的实际行动，表达他们衷心护拥总路线、大跃进、人民公社的热烈心情。到目前为止，全省粮食征购计划已经完成了76.62％，油料、棉花的收购量也比去年同期增加了，茶叶收购计划已经提前三个月超额完成，其他农副产品的收购量也都急剧上升。
    中共吉林省委书记处书记、吉林省省长栗又文在发言中谈到，吉林省在最近两个月内，组织了七次突击，掀起了两次农副土特产品生产、采集、收购工作的高潮。到10月31日，已经提前两个月完成了全年收购任务的104.7％。
    今天，河北省藁城县、新乐县和北京市怀柔县城关人民公社组织的报喜队，高举着粮、棉、猪、鸡蛋、水果等农产品的生产报捷牌和大红旗，喜气洋洋地来到中心会场，增添了大会的热烈气氛。怀柔县城关人民公社的喜报说，为了迎接今天广播大会的召开，他们已经在今天上午，提前两个月完成了今年粮食的征购任务。
    中共河北邯郸地委财贸部部长张醒华、中共河南濉县县委财贸部部长张树亭、中共山东临清市老赵庄公社委员会书记刘同庆和中共福建连江县委第一书记王洪志，相继在大会上介绍了他们提前、超额完成农副产品收购任务的经验，受到大会的重视。
    河南濉县实现了农副产品采购、加工、调运满堂红的经验和河北省青龙县亮甲台商店的党支部书记郑连玉，代表出席全国“群英会”的财贸方面的全体代表所作的发言，受到了大家的热烈欢迎。
    在广播大会进行的三个小时内，全国各地收听大会广播实况的公社社员和财贸工作者们，给大会中心会场打来了六百多次长途电话和加急电报，表示要以踊跃出售农产品的实际行动，来响应大会的号召。
