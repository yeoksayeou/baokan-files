Gao Huchen Improves Carburetor Parts
Six Years of Saving 4,500 Liters of Fuel

    △ Gao Huchen, a driver at the Tianjin Public Transportation Bureau, has saved 4,500 liters of gasoline in six years, achieved 230,000 kilometers without major repairs, and has not had any major traffic accidents for more than nine years.

    Gao Huchen was originally an excellent long-distance bus driver. In March of this year, he was transferred to the No. 2 Intra-city Motor Transport Team to drive a truck. Due to changes in the nature of transportation and technical conditions, his old experience was no longer applicable, and he encountered difficulties in his work. His fuel consumption once reached 8 to 9 liters per hundred ton-kilometers (the original quota was 6 liters). Based on the advice provided by veteran driver Liu Guosen, he paid special attention to the carburetor while driving. He took the carburetor from his vehicle home several times, disassembled it completely, and inspected each component, comparing it with the carburetors on ordinary vehicles. Finally, he discovered that the slow-speed air duct and oil pipe of his carburetor were on top, and the air duct was much thicker than that of ordinary carburetors. Gao Huchen thought: The problem must lie in the fact that too much air was entering, affecting the oil suction of the oil pipe, and the mixing ratio of air and oil was inappropriate. This caused the vehicle to seem like it couldn't breathe when starting, which naturally led to higher gasoline consumption. So, the next day, he made a round wooden plug, drilled a small hole in the middle, and plugged it into the slow-speed air duct. When he drove the car again, he felt that the recoil was much less. He then sharpened three wooden plugs with different hole sizes to experiment, and the results got better each time. Finally, the phenomenon of the car "gasping for air" was basically eliminated. Next, he adjusted the high-speed oil pipe to solve the problem of excessive oil output from the oil pipe when driving fast. After this series of experiments and adjustments to the parts, the fuel consumption dropped to 5.24 liters by June, breaking the quota for fuel consumption for long-distance buses with short-distance trucks in the city.

    Gao Huchen actively and voluntarily introduced his experience to other drivers, enabling them to save gasoline as well.

### 高虎臣改进化油部件  六年省油四千五百公升

    高虎臣改进化油部件
    六年省油四千五百公升
    △天津市公用交通局汽车司机高虎臣，他在六年中节约汽油四千五百公升，做到二十三万公里无大修，并有九年多没有发生过重大的行车事故。
    高虎臣原来是驾驶长途客车的优秀司机，今年3月被调到市内汽车运输二场驾驶货车。由于运输性质和技术条件都发生了变化，老经验用不上，在工作中碰到了困难。每百吨公里油耗曾一度达到八公升到九公升（原定额六公升）。他根据老司机刘国森提供的意见，在跑车时特别注意化油器的情况。他几次把车上的化油器带到家里，全部拆开，一个部件一个部件检查，同一般车上的化油器比较。最后他发现他那辆化油器的慢车风管和油管在上面，而风管却比一般化油器的风管粗得多。高虎臣就想：问题一定在于风进得多，影响了吸油管吸油，风和油的混合比例不适当，所以在起车的时候车总像喘不过气一样，这样汽油当然要用得多。于是，第二天他就做成一个圆形木塞，在中间钻成一个小孔，堵在慢车风管里。这样再开起车来，他就觉得后坐力少得多了。他又削了三个孔眼不同的木塞来试验，结果一次比一次好。最后汽车像喘不过气一样的现象基本没有了。接着他又把快车油管调整好，解决了开快车时油管出油过多的问题。经过这一连串的试验和调整机件，到6月份油耗量就降低到五点二四公升，使市内短途货车油耗量突破了长途客车油耗量的定额。
    高虎臣积极主动地把自己的经验介绍给别的司机，使别的司机也都节约了汽油。
