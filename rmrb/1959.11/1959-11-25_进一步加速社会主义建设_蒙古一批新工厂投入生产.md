Ulaanbaatar, November 24th (By our own correspondent) — Recently, a batch of new factories in Mongolia have commenced production or are about to commence production. The establishment of these new factories will further accelerate Mongolia's socialist construction and meet the needs of the people nationwide.

The paper mill and prefabricated wooden structure factory, which have already commenced production, are both emerging industrial enterprises in Mongolia. They utilize the country's abundant timber resources to meet the needs of the people. The paper mill produces 3,500 tons of various types of paper annually, supplying newsprint and packaging paper for domestic use. The prefabricated wooden structure factory produces 20,000 square meters of housing components annually, used to build wooden houses to meet the needs of herdsmen settling on the grasslands. The leather shoe factory, which began production not long ago, is equipped with new machinery and can produce 1.2 million pairs of leather shoes annually.

The wool textile mill and the Ulaanbaatar flour mill, which are under construction, are two relatively large-scale factories. The wool textile mill will utilize Mongolian wool and improved breed wool to weave various woolens and blankets. Based on equipment capacity, it will produce 800,000 meters of woolen clothing fabric and approximately 200,000 meters of blankets annually. In addition to meeting domestic needs, a portion can also be exported. The factory is currently undergoing trial production, and the quality of the trial production is very good.

The Ulaanbaatar flour mill can produce 25,000 tons of flour annually. The flour industry is a new enterprise recently established in Mongolia to process wheat and resolve domestic grain issues. This factory will soon be put into production ahead of schedule.

The establishment of these factories has further strengthened the ranks of the Mongolian working class and cultivated new technical forces. For example, the newly built wool textile mill requires more than 800 employees who have mastered various new technologies. The factories have adopted the method of building factories while cultivating talent, either sending employees to fraternal countries to study, or opening training courses with the help of experts from various countries. A group of employees who have mastered various advanced technologies are growing up.

These factories were all built with the help of fraternal countries.

    进一步加速社会主义建设
    蒙古一批新工厂投入生产
    本报乌兰巴托24日电　蒙古最近期间有一批新的工厂投入生产或即将投入生产。这些新工厂的建立，将进一步加速蒙古的社会主义建设和满足全国人民的需要。
    已经投入生产的造纸厂和木结构房屋预制厂都是蒙古新兴的工业企业，利用本国蕴藏丰富的木材资源，满足了人民的需要。造纸厂年产各种纸张三千五百吨，供应了国内新闻和包装用纸。木结构房屋预制厂年产房屋构件两万平方米，用来建造木结构房屋，适应牧民在草原上定居的需要。不久前开工生产的皮鞋厂是用新机器装备起来的，每年可产皮鞋一百二十万双。
    正在建设的毛纺厂和乌兰巴托面粉厂是两个规模较大的工厂，毛纺厂将利用蒙古羊毛和改良种羊毛纺织各种毛呢和毛毯，根据设备能力年产八十万米衣着用呢和二十万米左右毛毯，除满足国内人民需要外，还可以出口一部分。现在这个工厂正在进行试生产，试生产的产品质量很好。
    乌兰巴托面粉厂每年可产面粉二万五千吨，面粉工业是蒙古为加工小麦解决国内粮食问题在最近新建的一项新企业，这个工厂不久将提前投入生产。
    这些工厂的建立，进一步壮大了蒙古工人阶级的队伍，培养了新的技术力量。如新建的毛纺厂就需要掌握各种新技术的职工八百多人。各工厂采取边建厂边培养的办法，或派职工到各兄弟国家学习，或开训练班由各国专家帮助培养。一批掌握各种先进技术的职工正在成长起来。
    这些工厂都是在各兄弟国家的帮助下建成的。
