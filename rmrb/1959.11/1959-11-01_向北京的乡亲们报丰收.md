Reporting a Bumper Harvest to the Folks in Beijing
By Our Correspondent Song Huajiang

At the end of October, I once again visited the "Beijing Youth Collective Farm" in Luobei County, on the banks of the Heilongjiang River. This new village was established by young Beijing volunteers, who, with the help of the state and with the great ambition of building the frontier of the motherland, used their own hands to cultivate the wasteland.

Starting from the coal city of Hegang, driving along the flat Hegang-Luobei Highway for less than three hours, a new village composed of rows of neat houses appeared before my eyes.

The farm was quiet, with only a few female team members cleaning radishes, cabbages, and potatoes in front of the canteen. Among these women, I saw Pang Shuying, one of the initiators of the reclamation team, who is now the deputy captain of this brigade. When we talked about the changes over the past few years, she said, in a nutshell: the Beijing Farm, which developed with animal-powered farm tools, has now realized agricultural mechanization this year. Mechanization has improved work efficiency, saved labor, and made it possible to implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" more comprehensively, so the crops have grown exceptionally well and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Wheat yields an average of 200 jin per mu; soybeans have not yet been threshed, but according to actual on-the-spot measurements and estimations, they will yield at least 260 jin per mu.

Seeing these inspiring scenes reminded me of the situation in 1955. That year, on September 3, I came to this wasteland with the young people of the Beijing Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team and witnessed how they plowed the first furrow. In the past three years, they have reclaimed 15,000 mu of wasteland into fertile fields. With the development of reclamation and production, the team members have gradually grown up and become new-type farmers with socialist consciousness and the ability to master new agricultural technologies. More than 40 young people have been tested in the struggle for production and have joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League.

Reclamation team members like to sing a song like this: "The crops are harvested, and love is also maturing..." The young people of the Beijing Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team have already settled down in the wasteland. These young people have given birth to more than a dozen children in the new village on the wasteland. When we came to the home of team member Liu Shuying, her maternity leave had just ended, and she was playing with her newborn daughter. She told us that her eldest daughter, who was born on the wasteland, is in kindergarten. Hospitable Liu Shuying, while talking, kept busy lighting cigarettes and pouring water. I took the opportunity to look around her small bedroom: in this room, the heated kang was covered with clean sheets. Although it was just after autumn, the stove had already been lit, and soft sunlight shone in through the bright glass windows, making the room exceptionally warm.

We sat on the kang and talked. When she learned that we were reporters from the People's Daily, Liu Shuying excitedly told us that she and her husband, Li Zhenhua, are both young people from Zhanggezhuang in Fengtai District, Beijing. Mentioning her hometown, she said: Although the comrades here constantly correspond with Beijing, they don’t yet know about our bumper harvest this year. Can you pass on our new good news of the bumper harvest to them?

    向北京的乡亲们报丰收
    本报记者　宋化江
    10月底，我再一次访问了黑龙江畔萝北县的“北京青年集体农庄”。这是北京青年志愿垦荒队员们，在国家扶助下，抱着建设祖国边疆的雄心大志，用他们的双手在荒地上建立起来的新农村。
    从煤城鹤岗出发，沿着平坦的鹤萝公路，汽车行驶不到三个小时，一排排整齐的房屋构成的新农村，便出现在眼前。
    农庄里静悄悄的，只有几个女队员在食堂门前，清理萝卜、白菜和土豆子。我在这几个妇女中间，看见了垦荒队发起人之一的庞淑英，她现在是这个大队的副队长。我们谈起这几年的变化，她说，概括起来一句话：用畜力农具发展起来的北京庄，今年实现农业机械化了。机械化提高了工效，节省了劳力，使这里有条件比较全面地贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，因此庄稼生长的格外好，获得了空前大丰收。小麦平均每亩收二百斤；大豆还没有脱完粒，据实打实测估算，每亩至少收二百六十多斤。
    看到这些令人振奋的情景，使我想起了1955年的情况。那年9月3日，我和北京青年志愿垦荒队的青年们，一同来到这块荒地上，亲眼看到他们怎样开起了第一条犁沟。在过去的三年中，他们把一万五千亩荒地开垦成良田。随着开荒和生产的发展，队员们也逐渐成长起来，变成了有社会主义觉悟、能掌握新的农业技术的新型农民了。有四十多名青年经过生产斗争的考验，参加了共产党和共青团。
    垦荒队员喜欢唱这样一首歌，“庄稼收割了，爱情也成熟了……”。北京青年志愿垦荒队的青年们，已经在荒地上安家立业。这些青年在荒地新村里已生下了十几个小孩。我们来到队员刘淑英家的时候，她的产假刚满，正在逗新生的小女孩玩呢。她告诉我们，在荒地上生的大女儿，正在幼儿园里。好客的刘淑英，一面说着，一面点烟倒水，忙个不停。我趁机环视了她这小小的卧室：这间房子里，火炕上铺着整洁的床单，现在虽然刚刚过完秋天，可是已经升起了火炉，从明亮的玻璃窗上，射进了柔和的阳光，屋里分外暖和。
    我们坐在炕上谈了起来。当她知道我们是人民日报记者的时候，刘淑英兴奋地告诉我们，她和她爱人李振华都是首都丰台区张格庄的青年。提到家乡，她说：我们这里的同志们虽然和北京不断有书信来往，但是我们这里今年的丰收情况他们还不知道，你们能够把我们的新的丰收喜讯传给他们吗？
