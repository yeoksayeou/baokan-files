Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 14th - The Lebanese "News Weekly" published an editorial today pointing out that the recent sinister activities of the "Central Treaty Organization" since the meeting in Washington have more clearly proven that "imperialism remains the main enemy of the people of Arab countries, and remains the enemy of national causes and the peace and security of the Arab world."

The newspaper exposed the "Central Treaty Organization's" plot against Iraq. It pointed out that the three Asian member states of the "Central Treaty Organization" are about to hold a high-level meeting in Tehran, neighboring countries' troops are gathering on the Iraqi border, and the "Central Treaty Organization" member states are planning to hold military exercises in the Arabian Sea. The newspaper then pointed out that all these prove that imperialism is still carrying out various conspiracies against the Arab people, and also proves that the Arab people's struggle against the imperialists has not only not ended, but is still very acute.

This newspaper reports that according to the "Central Treaty Organization" military group headquarters' announcement on the 12th, while the heads of state of Turkey, Iran and Pakistan hold talks, the United States, Britain, Turkey, Pakistan and Iran will hold a joint naval exercise in the Arabian Sea near Karachi, Pakistan from November 16th to December 4th. This exercise is the second military exercise of this military group this month. From November 4th to 6th, the "Central Treaty Organization" held an air force exercise in central Iran and western Pakistan. The United States, which is not a member of this group, played a leading role in both exercises.

These military exercises of the "Central Treaty Organization" are part of the United States' activities to create tension in the Middle East and threaten nationally independent countries.

Before and after the "Central Treaty Organization" Council meeting, the United States has been building military projects on a large scale in Turkey. The United States has expanded the Black Sea port of Trabzon, near the Soviet border, and the Mediterranean port of Iskenderun, near the Syrian region, and is building a new Gizler-Hakkari-Siveran road in southeastern Turkey, near Iraq; it will also build a railway from Tabriz in Iran to Mus in Turkey. According to Turkey's "New Istanbul Daily," after a delegation from the "Central Treaty Organization" inspected Trabzon Port on October 20, construction will begin on expanding it into a mechanized port. On October 30, the United States formally announced that the United States and Turkey had reached an agreement on the details of establishing U.S. intermediate-range missile bases on Turkish territory. In fact, construction of the base has already begun.

According to Pakistan's "Military and Civilian News," the "Central Treaty Organization" member states are actively planning to establish a "Joint Command" as soon as possible. The newspaper pointed out that the member states of this military group, Iran, Turkey and Pakistan, will have to recruit more armed forces for the "Joint Command."

The heads of state of Turkey, Iran and Pakistan will hold a meeting in Tehran today. According to Agence France-Presse, this "highest-level talk" between Turkey, Pakistan and Iran is mainly to study the so-called "developments in the Iraqi situation"; news also said that this meeting will plot conspiracies against Iraq.

Prior to this meeting, Iranian King Pahlavi visited Jordan from November 2nd to 6th and held talks with Jordanian King Hussein on the Iraqi situation. Recent news about Jordan's contacts with "Central Treaty Organization" member states Turkey and Iran indicate that someone is trying to lure Jordan to join the "Central Treaty Organization" and participate in the military group's plot against Iraq. According to the British "News Chronicle" on October 26, Jordan is preparing to send troops to intervene in Iraq, while the British "Daily Mail" and United Press International reported that Jordan has stationed troops on the Iraqi border waiting for an opportunity to act.

This newspaper reports that Lebanese newspapers have recently fiercely criticized the United States fleet's plot to establish a temporary base in Lebanon.

"Anwar Newspaper" reported on the 9th that the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean wanted to establish a temporary base in Lebanon, and the U.S. government may have asked Lebanon to allow the Sixth Fleet to temporarily dock in Beirut.

"New World Newspaper" published an editorial on the same day saying that this news "has aroused the anger of all the Lebanese people." The newspaper pointed out: "All the Lebanese people will stand up unanimously and declare that they are ready to carry out a bloody war to prevent any foreigners from undermining their independence, dignity and sovereignty."

Prior to this, Lebanese newspapers had repeatedly condemned the frequent "visits" of the U.S. fleet to Lebanon. "News" believes: "The port of Beirut is actually often under the occupation of the US fleet." "Voice" wrote: "For the sake of Lebanon's interests, the doors of Lebanon should be closed, and no warships of the US Sixth Fleet or other imperialist countries that harbor aggressive plans against us should be allowed to enter," "The Lebanese people cannot tolerate their ports being frequently under the muzzle of foreign cannons, and these cannons are used against our country."

    帝国主义依然是阿拉伯人民的主要敌人
    “中央条约组织”加紧策划反伊阴谋
    美国又伙同成员国准备举行联合军事演习
    新华社贝鲁特14日电　黎巴嫩“消息周报”今天发表的社论指出，“中央条约组织”在华盛顿开会以后最近所进行的阴险活动已经更加清楚地证明，“帝国主义仍然是阿拉伯各国人民的主要敌人，仍然是民族事业以及阿拉伯世界的和平和安全的敌人。”
    这家报纸揭露了“中央条约组织”所策划的反对伊拉克的阴谋。它指出，“中央条约组织”在亚洲的三个成员国即将在德黑兰举行高级会议，邻国军队在伊拉克边境集结，“中央条约组织”的成员国计划在阿拉伯海洋举行军事演习。这家报纸接着指出，所有这些证明了帝国主义仍在对阿拉伯人民进行各种阴谋，也证明了阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义者的斗争不仅没有结束，而且还非常尖锐。
    本报讯　据“中央条约组织”军事集团总部12日宣布，在土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦三国首脑举行会谈的同时，美国、英国、土耳其、巴基斯坦和伊朗将于11月16日到12月4日在巴基斯坦卡拉奇附近的阿拉伯海海面举行一次联合海军演习。这次演习是本月以来这个军事集团第二次军事演习。11月4日到6日，“中央条约组织”曾经在伊朗中部和西巴基斯坦举行了一次空军演习。并非这个集团成员的美国在两次演习中都担任了主角。
    “中央条约组织”的这些军事演习都是美国制造中东地区紧张局势，威胁民族独立国家活动的一部分。
    在“中央条约组织”理事会开会前后，美国已经在土耳其大规模地兴建军事工程。美国已经扩建靠近苏联边境的黑海港口特拉布松和靠近叙利亚地区的地中海港口伊斯肯德伦，以及在靠近伊拉克的土耳其东南部建造一条吉兹勒—哈卡里—西韦兰新公路；还将建设一条从伊朗的大不里士到土耳其的谟斯的铁路。据土耳其“新伊斯坦布尔日报”报道，“中央条约组织”10月20日派遣的一个使团的视察后，特拉布松港最近将开始动工扩建成为机械化港口。10月30日，美国又正式宣布，美国和土耳其已就在土耳其领土上建立美国中程导弹基地细节问题达成协议。实际上，基地工程早已动工。
    据巴基斯坦“军民报”报道，“中央条约组织”成员国正在积极筹划早日建立“联合司令部”。报纸指出，这个军事集团的成员国伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦将必须为“联合司令部”招募更多的武装部队。
    土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦三国首脑将于今天在德黑兰举行会议。据法新社报道，这次土、巴、伊（朗）“最高级会谈”主要是研究所谓“伊拉克局势的发展”；又有消息说，这次会议将策划反对伊拉克的阴谋。
    在这次会议以前，伊朗国王巴列维在11月2日至6日曾到约旦进行过一次访问，与约旦国王侯赛因就伊拉克局势举行了会谈。最近的一些关于约旦同“中央条约组织”成员国土耳其和伊朗的接触的消息表明，有人正在诱使约旦参加“中央条约组织”，并且参与这个军事集团所策划的反对伊拉克的阴谋。据英国“新闻纪事报”10月26日报道，约旦准备派军队干涉伊拉克，而英国“每日邮报”和合众国际社报道说，约旦已陈兵伊拉克边境伺机行动。
    本报讯　黎巴嫩报纸最近激烈抨击美国舰队准备在黎巴嫩建立临时基地的阴谋。
    “安瓦尔报”9日报道说，美国在地中海的第六舰队想在黎巴嫩建立一个临时基地，美国政府可能已经要求黎巴嫩让第六舰队暂时停泊在贝鲁特。
    “新世界报”同天发表社论说，这个消息“已经引起了全体黎巴嫩人民的愤怒”。该报指出：“全体黎巴嫩人民将一致站起来，宣布他们准备进行流血战争，不让任何外国人损害他们的独立、尊严和主权”。
    在此之前，黎巴嫩报纸就已纷纷谴责美国舰队的频繁“访问”黎巴嫩。“新闻报”认为：“贝鲁特港口实际上经常处在美国舰队的占领之下”。“呼声报”写道：“为了黎巴嫩利益起见，黎巴嫩的大门应该关上，不让美国第六舰队或是其他对我们抱有侵略计划的帝国主义国家的军舰进来”，“黎巴嫩人民不能容忍他们的港口经常处在外国大炮的炮口下，而这些大炮是用来反对我们的国家的”。
