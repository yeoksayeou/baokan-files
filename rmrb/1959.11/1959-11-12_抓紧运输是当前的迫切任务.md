    Transportation plays a very important role in industrial and agricultural production. The products of any enterprise must be transported to consumers; any enterprise that wants to carry out production also needs the transportation department to deliver raw materials in a timely manner. After each production upsurge, there must be a corresponding transportation upsurge, which is a long-proven experience. Now that the increase production and practice economy movement has been universally launched on the economic front, how to make transportation work closely follow up has become a very urgent and important task.
    On the industrial front, production in all walks of life is booming. It is now very clear that this year's industrial production plan will definitely be completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule. While grasping the completion of this year's plan, industrial workers are also seizing the time to prepare for the continued leap forward in production and construction next year. Whether it is to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule or to prepare for the first quarter of next year's production, transportation is an important gateway and an important link to ensure our continued leap forward in the future. Since the Great Leap Forward, the production capacity of various industries in our country has greatly improved, but the growth of transportation capacity is relatively insufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to grasp transportation and do everything possible to make transportation keep up with the needs of industrial development and broaden the road for the continued leap forward in industrial production.
    On the agricultural front, the vast number of farmers who have won the autumn harvest have launched a large-scale water conservancy movement and a "small autumn harvest" movement. An important part of water conservancy projects is transportation. Doing a good job in transportation can speed up the progress of water conservancy projects and greatly save labor. In the "small autumn harvest" movement, the harvest of wild plants is very large, and to transport these things out, it is necessary to seize transportation.
    On the commercial front, sales are currently booming. In particular, with the victory of the autumn harvest and the "small autumn harvest" movement, the purchase of grain and various agricultural and sideline products will inevitably have a greater upsurge, and it will inevitably require commercial departments to transport more agricultural production materials and farmers' living materials to rural areas. Especially when the Party proposes to accelerate the realization of agricultural technical transformation and industrial workers are strengthening their support for agriculture with great enthusiasm, the task of industrial products going to the countryside will inevitably become increasingly heavy. Therefore, to do a good job in commercial purchase and sales, the first requirement is to do a good job in transportation.
    The good situation and the trend of continued leap forward in all fronts of industry, agriculture, and commerce have put forward more and more urgent requirements to the transportation department. Although the current situation on the transportation front is also extremely good, from January to September, railway freight volume increased by 45.9% compared with the same period last year, which is 2.18 million tons more than the freight volume completed in the whole year of last year; the freight volume of water transport enterprises directly under the central government also increased by 48.4% compared with the same period last year; the freight volume of highway transportation and short-distance transportation has also increased several times. However, compared with the requirements of the leap forward situation on all fronts of industry, agriculture, and commerce, transportation is still incompatible. Large transportation volume and small transportation capacity is still a contradiction that needs continued efforts to resolve. According to calculations, the railway freight volume in the fourth quarter of this year will increase by 17.4% compared with the third quarter, the freight volume of water transport enterprises directly under the central government will increase by 25.3% compared with the third quarter, and the freight volume of short-distance transportation will increase by 70% compared with the third quarter. It is still very difficult to complete such a heavy transportation task in the fourth quarter relying solely on existing transportation equipment and tools. In order to adapt to the current economic situation and excellently complete the transportation task, in addition to striving to complete the task of adding a part of transportation tools and equipment and striving to accelerate the technical transformation of some links with weak passing capacity, the key lies in continuing to oppose right-leaning thoughts, boosting morale, and developing the mass movement on the transportation front that has already been launched extensively and deeply.
    Large transportation volume and small transportation capacity is a contradiction that has occurred almost every year. However, each time this situation is due to firmly relying on the strength and wisdom of the masses, vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, finding solutions, overcoming difficulties, and completing tasks, and in this process greatly improving transportation work. Last year was especially true. Last year, when loading and unloading work became a weak link, the masses created experiences such as "ants moving Mount Tai," people's communes running loading and unloading, and "moving the line," and also created methods such as "high platform, low cargo position" and various kinds of loading and unloading machinery combining indigenous and foreign methods. When the station's marshalling capacity was insufficient and blockages occurred, the masses created "earth humps" for shunting equipment. When daily necessities and other scattered goods could not be transported, the masses created the "carry-on transportation" method. When automobile transportation capacity was severely insufficient, the masses promoted the experience of "automobile trailer transportation" and double-shift or triple-shift transportation. When short-distance transportation was particularly tight, the masses created a wealth of various short-distance transportation methods according to local conditions and local materials. It is true that the wisdom and strength of the masses can overcome all difficulties. Since vigorously carrying out mass movements in the past overcame so many difficulties, today, facing the huge transportation task in the fourth quarter and preparing for the transportation task in the first quarter of next year, the only correct way out is to adhere to the mass line, continue to vigorously carry out mass movements, and continue to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. Moreover, we have accumulated rich experience in vigorously carrying out mass movements on the transportation front, the technical equipment of the transportation industry has been greatly increased and improved, and the transportation network has also been greatly expanded and strengthened. As long as we thoroughly criticize right-leaning thought, boost morale, and fully use these favorable conditions to continue to vigorously carry out mass movements, the huge transportation task in the fourth quarter can definitely be completed.
    In the mass movement of transportation, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of combining foreign and indigenous methods in vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution. On the one hand, it is necessary to accelerate the construction of heavy-rail railways, develop automobile transportation, ship transportation, and air transportation, and add modern loading and unloading equipment; on the other hand, which is also the main aspect at present, it is necessary to vigorously build light railways, earthen railways, wooden track, bamboo rail roads according to the specific conditions of various places, vigorously promote vehicle-ization, shipping, cableway-ization, chute-ization, vigorously promote "high platform, low cargo position," "earth humps," earthen loading and unloading equipment, etc. In short, it is necessary to adopt various simple methods that can achieve results relatively quickly and save labor to solve transportation problems according to local conditions. Only in this way can we give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses in running transportation and quickly enhance transportation capacity.
    In the mass movement of transportation, it is necessary to continue to carry forward the communist spirit of cooperation. In recent years, especially in the past year or so, the reason why the transportation efficiency of various transportation departments across the country has been greatly improved is that launching the masses to vigorously carry out internal and external cooperation is an important factor. Transportation cooperation, whether it is cooperation between various links within transportation enterprises, or cooperation between various different transportation departments, or cooperation between transportation departments and factories and mining enterprises or with material consignment departments, has been greatly developed in the past year or so and has achieved extremely rich experience. For example, the experience of Qinhuangdao in combining mines, railways, ports, ships, and receiving units to implement the "one-dragon" large-scale cooperation of fast loading, fast transportation, and fast unloading is a new development in the cooperation between transportation departments and factories and mining enterprises. All these cooperative experiences should be promoted deeply and universally. It is necessary to greatly promote the noble style of "leaving difficulties to oneself and giving convenience to others" among the broad masses of workers and educate transportation department workers to better serve all departments of the national economy. At the same time, it is also necessary to educate material consignment department workers to create more favorable conditions for transportation work and save the country's transportation capacity more.
    In the mass movement of transportation, the particularly important task at present is to further develop the mass movement of short-distance transportation. On the one hand, short-distance transportation is the collection and distribution line of trunk line transportation. If short-distance transportation is not strengthened, trunk line transportation will be difficult to run smoothly. On the other hand, it is closely related to production, especially the production of "small modern groups" enterprises. As everyone knows, this year, the pig iron produced by the "small modern groups" iron and steel enterprises accounts for about half of the country's pig iron production, and the coal produced by the "small modern groups" coal kilns accounts for about one-third of the country's coal production; many of the products produced by these "small modern groups" iron and steel enterprises and "small modern groups" coal kilns have to be transported out by short-distance transportation. As for the purchase and transfer of many agricultural and sideline products, it goes without saying that they all rely on short-distance transportation for collection and distribution. Since the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Instructions on Launching a Mass Short-Distance Transportation Movement," all localities have taken active actions to strengthen short-distance transportation. The characteristics of this movement are great enthusiasm and good organization. It is both vigorous and down-to-earth. In all places, the Party committee takes the lead, and leading cadres go to the front line to direct, grasping both transportation and transportation construction. The current task is to consolidate and develop this mass movement of short-distance transportation and transport all the accumulated goods waiting to be transported and everything that needs to be transported. To this end, it is necessary to better strengthen the political and ideological work and organizational management work of the mass movement of short-distance transportation, and vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution.
    At present, the mass movement on the entire transportation front has risen. In order to make the mass movement on the transportation front continue to develop, transportation leading departments in various places should better arrange transportation work, give full play to the role of various transportation tools, implement the principle of comprehensively utilizing various transportation tools and reasonable transportation, and achieve the connection between long-distance transportation and short-distance transportation, and the cooperation between transportation and loading and unloading. While ensuring the completion of transportation tasks, various transportation departments should also pay attention to transportation quality, reduce transportation costs, ensure safe production, achieve the overall requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical, and pay attention to the combination of work and rest for workers. In particular, attention should be paid to arranging the lives of the masses participating in short-distance transportation. By doing these tasks well, we can continuously promote transportation work forward, ensure the early completion and overfulfillment of this year's national economic plan, and provide better transportation conditions for the continued leap forward of the national economy in 1960.

    抓紧运输是当前的迫切任务
    运输在工农业生产中处于很重要地位，任何企业生产出来的产品，都要通过运输才能送到消费者的手上；任何企业要进行生产，也都需要运输部门及时运到原材料。每一次的生产高潮出现之后，必需要有一个相应的运输高潮，这也是久经证明的经验了。现在经济战线上增产节约运动已经普遍展开了，如何使运输工作紧紧跟上去，又成为一项十分迫切的重要任务。
    在工业战线上，各行各业的生产蒸蒸日上，现在已经可以看得十分清楚：今年的工业生产计划一定可以提前完成和超额完成。工业战线上的职工在抓紧完成今年计划的同时，正在抓紧做好明年生产建设继续跃进的准备工作。无论是为了提前完成今年计划，或者是为明年第一季度生产做好准备，运输都是一个重要的关口，是保证我们今后继续跃进的一个重要环节。大跃进以来，我国的各种工业的生产能力有了很大的提高，而运输能力的增长却相对地显得不足。因此，必须抓紧运输，千方百计地使运输跟上工业发展的需要，为工业生产的继续跃进拓宽道路。
    在农业战线上，赢得了秋季丰收的广大农民又掀起了规模浩大的水利运动和“小秋收”运动，水利工程中的一个重要部分就是运输，搞好运输工作就可以加快水利工程的进度，大大地节省劳动力。在“小秋收”运动中野生植物的收获量很大，而要把这些东西运出来，又要抓紧运输。
    在商业战线上，目前正是购销两旺。特别是随着秋季丰收和“小秋收”运动的胜利，粮食和各种农副产品的收购工作必然会有一个更大的高潮，也必然要求商业部门把更多的农业生产资料和农民生活资料运到农村，特别是在党提出加速实现农业技术改造，工业职工正以极大的热情加强对农业的支援的时候，工业品下乡的任务也必然日趋繁重。因此，要做好商业的购销工作，首先就要求做好运输工作。
    工、农、商各个战线的良好形势和继续跃进的趋势，都向运输部门提出了愈来愈多的和愈来愈迫切的要求。目前运输战线的形势虽然也是极为良好的，1至9月份，铁路货运量比去年同期增长了45.9％，比去年全年完成的货运量还多出二百一十八万吨；中央直属水运企业的货运量也比去年同期增长了48.4％；公路运输以及短途运输的货运量也有了成倍的增长。但是，同工、农、商各个战线跃进形势的要求比较起来，运输仍然是不相适应的。运量大，运力小，仍然是一个尚待继续努力解决的矛盾。根据计算，今年第四季度铁路货运量将比第三季度增长17.4％，中央直属水运企业的货运量将比第三季度增长25.3％，短途运输货运量将比第三季度增长70％，仅仅依靠现有的运输设备和运输工具，来完成第四季度这样繁重的运输任务，还是很困难的。为了适应当前的经济形势，出色地完成运输任务，除了努力完成增加一部分运输工具和设备的任务以及努力对某些通过能力薄弱的环节加速技术改造以外，关键在于继续反右倾、鼓干劲，把目前已经开展起来的运输战线上的群众运动广泛深入地发展下去。
    运量大、运力小，这几乎是历年来都要发生的矛盾。但是，这种情况每一次都由于坚决依靠群众的力量和智慧，大搞技术革新和技术革命，找到了办法，克服了困难，完成了任务，并且在这个过程中把运输工作大大地提高了一步。去年尤其是如此。在去年，当装卸工作成为薄弱环节的时候，群众就创造了“蚂蚁搬泰山”、人民公社办装卸和“线路搬家”等经验，还创造了“高站台、低货位”的办法和各种各样土洋结合的装卸机具。当车站编组能力不足，发生堵塞的时候，群众就创造了“土驼峰”的调车设备。当日用百货和其他零星物资运不走的时候，群众就创造了“捎脚运输”的办法。当汽车运输力严重不足的时候，群众就推广了“汽车拖挂运输”、双班或三班运输的经验。当短途运输特别紧张的时候，群众就因地制宜、就地取材，创造了丰富多采的各种各样的短途运输方式。真是千难万难难不倒群众的智慧和力量。既然过去大搞群众运动克服了那样多的困难，今天，面对着第四季度巨大的运输任务，以及为明年第一季度的运输任务作好准备，唯一正确的出路就是坚持群众路线，继续大搞群众运动，继续大搞技术革新和技术革命。况且，我们在运输战线上大搞群众运动已经积累了丰富的经验，运输业的技术装备已经有了大量的增加和改善，运输网也已经有了很大的扩展和加强。只要把右倾反透，把干劲鼓足，充分运用这些有利条件，继续大搞群众运动，第四季度巨大的运输任务一定是可以完成的。
    在交通运输的群众运动中，大搞技术革新和技术革命，必须继续贯彻洋土并举的方针。一方面要加快重轨铁路的建设，发展汽车运输、轮船运输、航空运输，增添现代化的装卸设备；另一方面，也是当前主要的方面，是要根据各地具体情况大搞轻便铁路、土铁路、木轨道、竹轨路，大搞车子化、船运化、索道化、溜槽化，大搞“高站台，低货位”、“土驼峰”、土装卸设备等等。总之，要因地制宜地采用各种简便的、能比较快地见到功效、能节约劳动力的办法来解决运输问题。也只有这样，才能发挥广大群众办运输的积极性和创造性，才能迅速增强运输力量。　
    在交通运输的群众运动中，要继续发扬共产主义的协作精神。这些年来，特别是近一年多来，全国各个运输部门的运输效率所以能有很大的提高，发动群众大搞内外协作，是一个重要因素。运输方面的协作，不论是运输企业内部各个环节之间的协作，还是各个不同运输部门之间的协作，不论是运输部门与厂矿企业或者与物资托运部门之间的协作，在近一年多来都有了极大的发展，并且取得了极为丰富的经验。例如，秦皇岛把矿山、铁路、港口、船舶和收货单位等结合在一起，实行快装、快运、快卸的“一条龙”大协作的经验，就是运输部门与厂矿企业之间的协作的一个新的发展。所有这些协作经验，都应该深入地普遍地推广。要在广大职工群众中大大地发扬“把困难留给自己，将方便送给别人”的高尚风格，教育运输部门的职工更好地为国民经济各个部门服务，同时也应该教育物资托运部门的职工更多地为运输工作创造有利的条件，更加节约国家的运输力量。
    在交通运输的群众运动中，当前特别重要的任务是进一步开展短途运输的群众运动。短途运输一方面是干线运输的集散线，短途运输得不到加强，干线运输就难以畅通；另一方面又同生产、特别是“小洋群”企业的生产有着密切的联系。大家知道，今年“小洋群”炼铁企业生产的生铁占全国生铁产量的一半左右，“小洋群”煤窑生产的煤炭占全国煤炭产量的三分之一左右；这些“小洋群”炼铁企业和“小洋群”煤窑生产出来的产品很多都要靠短途运输运出去。至于很多农副产品的收购、调运都要靠短途运输集散就不用说了。自从中共中央和国务院发布了“关于开展群众短途运输运动的指示”以后，各地已积极行动起来加强短途运输。这次运动的特点是干劲大，组织好，既是轰轰烈烈，又是踏踏实实。各个地方都是党委挂帅，领导干部亲赴第一线指挥，既抓运输，也抓交通建设。现在的任务是要把这个短途运输的群众运动巩固和发展下去，把积存待运和一切要运的东西都运出来。为此，就要更好地加强短途运输群众运动的政治思想工作和组织管理工作，大搞技术革新和技术革命。
    当前，整个运输战线上的群众运动已经起来了，为了使交通运输战线上的群众运动持续地发展下去，各地运输领导部门应该更好地安排运输工作，充分发挥各种运输工具的作用，贯彻综合利用各种运输工具和合理运输的原则，做到长途运输与短途运输相衔接，运输与装卸相配合。各个运输部门在保证完成运输任务的同时，还要注意运输质量，降低运输费用，保证安全生产，实现多快好省的全面要求，并且注意职工的劳逸结合。特别是对于参加短途运输的群众，更要注意安排他们的生活。做好这些工作，我们就可以把运输工作持续不断地向前推进，保证今年国民经济计划的提前完成和超额完成，为1960年国民经济继续跃进提供更好的运输条件。
