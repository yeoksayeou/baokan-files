Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi: Cadres and members of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and workers of various military reclamation farms are determined to work hard this winter and next spring to strive to expand the irrigated area by six million mu.

The characteristic of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's winter water conservancy projects is still to focus on renovating old irrigation canals and giving full play to the benefits of existing water conservancy facilities, and to plan and build a number of large, medium, and small-sized water storage and diversion projects.

At present, the number of migrant workers entering various construction sites has exceeded three times that of the same period in 1958.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining: By October 25th, Qinghai Province had mobilized more than 300,000 people to repair water conservancy projects and reclaim wasteland. In the province, more than 8,000 new and renovated canals, and 39 reservoirs have been built, expanding the irrigated area by more than 210,000 mu and reclaiming more than 1.1 million mu of wasteland; an average of 500 canals have been completed and more than 68,000 mu of wasteland have been turned into farmland every day.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot: More than 150,000 water management personnel in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are working hard in the Xiliao River Basin and the Hetao Irrigation Area of the Yellow River. In the Zhelimumeng, the main agricultural area in the east, more than 40,000 members of all ethnic groups started water conservancy construction on both sides of the Xiliao River and the Xin Kai River in early October. Within 22 days, 18 canals have been newly built and renovated, and 49 various structures have been completed. In Bayannur League, located in the Hetao area of the Yellow River, the people's communes are carrying out autumn irrigation while vigorously repairing the main canals. The massive Yellow River Main Canal project has completed more than 1.8 million cubic meters of earthwork after hard work by more than 20,000 migrant workers. A number of new medium and small-sized reservoir projects have also been started in Alxa Banner and other places in the Helan Mountains.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: Guangdong Province broke historical convention and started the winter water conservancy construction movement for the first time before the late-rice crops were harvested. According to statistics, the province had mobilized more than 700,000 laborers to participate in water conservancy construction before the autumn harvest. Large and medium-sized projects benefiting more than 10,000 mu and key projects below the county level have generally started construction ahead of schedule. Most of these water conservancy projects can be completed or basically completed before the arrival of the spring flood next year, which will not be threatened by spring floods and will not affect spring plowing production.

The water conservancy projects planned by Guangdong Province to be built and continued to be built this winter and next spring are not only large in scale and have many backbone projects, but also are mostly comprehensive projects that combine flood control, irrigation, power generation, and other aspects of river basin management and development.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming: More than 300 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects in Yunnan Province have been fully started. 200,000 migrant workers have already gone to the construction sites, and more than 1 million migrant workers are preparing to set off.

In the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, which has suffered from relatively severe droughts in previous years, after the basic completion of autumn sowing, more than 20,000 members of the prefecture took advantage of the victory and transferred to the water conservancy front. People's communes in various places uniformly transferred labor, carried out large-scale cooperation, vigorously carried out tool reforms to improve work efficiency, and ensured the rapid start of large and medium-sized projects.

This newspaper: Winter water conservancy construction in the suburbs of Beijing has begun. The first secretaries of each district (county) personally took charge, and the vanguard force composed of more than 70,000 people has already invested in the water conservancy battle, and more than 200,000 water conservancy troops are about to go to the construction site.

According to the decision of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the water conservancy construction in the suburbs this winter and next spring will continue to implement the policy of "focusing on water storage, focusing on small-scale projects, and focusing on commune-run projects," and appropriately increase the construction and expansion of a number of medium-sized projects, continue to complete several large projects, and achieve a combination of large, medium, and small projects, so as to form a water conservancy system in a large area of the suburbs with interconnected reservoirs and canals, and self-flowing irrigation and drainage.

This newspaper: 100,000 members of the people's communes in Zhangye Prefecture, Gansu Province, are advancing triumphantly on the water conservancy construction front that winds for more than 2,000 li.

The Hongyashan Reservoir in Minqin County, which stores 127 million cubic meters of water and can irrigate 700,000 mu of land, and the Yuejin Canal, which is 78 kilometers long, are being built on severely leaky quicksand foundations. The migrant workers have brought their collective wisdom into play and used advanced construction experiences such as pebble-lined canals and tunneling into gravel layers as deep as 100 meters, opening up broad avenues for building durable canals with strong erosion resistance and high seepage prevention benefits, and for diverting water from deep valleys to the shore.

Technical revolution and invention movements have been carried out at water conservancy construction sites in various places, greatly improving work efficiency. Zheng Zhanqiu, a migrant worker at the Shigou Reservoir in Shandan County, created a stepped, segmented, and layered "grid soil extraction" method, with an average progress of 60 cubic meters per working day, which is more than ten times higher than the original work efficiency.

    冬季生产“水”字当先
    各地以中小型为主结合兴修大型工程
    新疆
    据新华社乌鲁木齐讯　新疆各族社员和各军垦农场职工，决心大干一冬一春，力争扩大灌溉面积六百万亩。
    新疆维吾尔自治区水利冬修工程的特点，仍以改建旧灌渠、充分发挥现有水利设施效益为主，并有计划地新建一批大、中、小型蓄水、引水工程。
    目前，进入各个工地的民工，已超过1958年同期的三倍以上。
    青海
    据新华社西宁讯　青海省到10月25日，投入修水利和垦荒的群众已达三十多万人，在全省已新修、整修渠道八千多条，水库三十九座，扩大灌溉面积二十一万多亩，开荒造田一百一十多万亩；平均每天有五百条渠道修成，六万八千多亩荒滩变成农田。内蒙古
    据新华社呼和浩特讯　内蒙古自治区十五万多名治水队伍正在西辽河流域、黄河后套灌区等地大干特干。东部主要农业区哲里木盟，10月初就有四万多各族社员，在西辽河两岸和新开河南北投入水利建设，二十二天内已新建和整修了渠道十八条，完成各种建筑物四十九处。位于黄河后套的巴彦淖尔盟，各人民公社一面进行秋灌，一面大修干渠。规模巨大的黄河总干渠工程，经过两万多民工奋战，已完成土方一百八十多万个。一批新的中小型水库工程，也在贺兰山地带的阿拉善旗等地陆续动工兴建。
    广东
    据新华社广州电　广东省打破历史常规，第一次在晚造作物开镰前开始了冬季水利兴修运动。据统计，全省在秋收前参加水利建设的劳动力已达七十多万人，受益万亩以上的大、中型工程和县以下重点工程已经普遍提前动工。这些水利工程大多数可以在明年春汛到来之前完成或基本完成，既不致受春洪威胁，又不致影响春耕生产。
    广东省规划的今冬明春兴建和继续修建的水利工程，不仅规模巨大、骨干工程多，而且大都是结合流域治理与开发的防洪、灌溉、发电等综合性工程。
    云南
    据新华社昆明讯　云南省有三百多个大中型水利工程已经全面动工。有二十万民工已经走上工地，一百多万民工正在整装待发。
    在历年干旱较为严重的红河哈尼族彝族自治州，秋种基本结束后，全州就有两万多社员乘胜转到水利战线。各地人民公社统一抽调劳动力，开展大协作，大搞工具改革提高工效，保证大、中型工程迅速开工。
    北京
    本报讯　北京郊区冬修水利已经开始。各区（县）的第一书记亲自挂帅，七万多人组成的先头部队已经投入了水利战斗，二十多万水利大军即将开赴工地。
    根据中共北京市委决定，郊区今冬明春的水利建设将继续贯彻执行“蓄水为主，小型为主，社办为主”的方针，并且适当地增建、扩建一批中型工程，继续完成几项大工程，做到大中小相结合，在郊区大面积内形成库渠相通、河沟相连、灌排自如的水利系统。
    张掖专区
    本报讯　甘肃省张掖专区十万名人民公社社员，正在蜿蜒两千多里的水利建设战线上高歌猛进。
    民勤县蓄水一亿二千七百万公方、可浇地七十万亩的红崖山水库和长达七十八公里的跃进渠道，是在渗漏严重的流沙地基上施工的，民工们发挥了集体智慧，运用了卵石衬砌渠道和开凿深达一百米砾石层隧道等先进施工经验，为建修经久耐用、抗冲能力强、防渗效益高的渠道，和由深谷引水上岸开辟了广阔途径。
    各地水利工地开展了技术革命和创造发明运动，使工效大大提高。山丹县寺沟水库民工郑赞球，创造台阶式分段分层“方格取土”法，每工日平均进度达到六十公方，比原工效提高十倍以上。
