    The Newborn Gelao People
    The Gelao ethnic group, which was almost wiped out before liberation, has regained its youth in the past decade under the brilliant light of the Party's ethnic policies.
    The Gelao ethnic group is one of the oldest ethnic groups in Southwest China. Currently, there are more than 23,900 people, scattered in Dafang, Zhijin, and Qianxi counties in the Bijie Special Zone of Guizhou. The images reflect the general living conditions of the Gelao people in the Qinyong Production Team of the Changshi Management Area, Changshi People's Commune, Dafang County. This team has a total of 38 households, including 27 Gelao households, 8 Han households, and 3 Yi households.

    新生的仡佬族
    解放前几乎被消灭了的仡佬族，十年来，在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，又恢复了青春。
    仡佬族是我国西南地区历史悠久的民族之一。目前共有二万三千九百多人，散居在贵州毕节专区的大方、织金、黔西等县。图片所反映的是居住在大方县长石人民公社长石管理区勤勇生产小队仡佬族人民生活概况。这个小队共三十八户，其中仡佬族二十七户、汉族八户、彝族三户。
