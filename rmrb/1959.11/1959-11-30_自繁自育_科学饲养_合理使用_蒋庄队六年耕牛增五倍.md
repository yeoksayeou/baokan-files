This newspaper from Jinan, 29th: The Shandong Liaocheng Prefectural Science and Technology Commission recently helped the Jiangzhuang Production Team of the Beiyangji People's Commune in Liaocheng City summarize their rich experience in breeding and raising draft animals. This production team, from the mutual aid group to the people's commune, has focused on the breeding and raising of draft cattle for six years, increasing the number of draft cattle from five to thirty-three, a fivefold increase, and without any deaths due to illness.

This production team has 248 people and 1,000 mu of cultivated land. In 1953, during the period of the year-round mutual aid group, there were only three cows and two bulls. The reason why draft animals have developed so quickly is primarily because they have implemented the policy of self-breeding, self-raising, and self-use. Their slogan is: "Big cows give birth to little cows, one after another, breeding without end."

Under the education of the Party branch, some veteran keepers, relying on years of rich experience, conscientiously do a good job in the breeding of draft animals. They closely grasp the estrus period of female animals. Old cows have a short estrus period, so they seize the time to mate them early; young cows have a long estrus period, so they mate them within two days of estrus. In terms of mating time, it is generally in the morning, when the female animals are most eager and accurate mating is more likely, and the birth rate of female calves is generally higher. Since 1956, newborn female calves have accounted for 60%. When cows give birth, the keepers firmly grasp the three keys to calving: cutting the umbilical cord, pinching the hooves, and protecting the eyes. They use a new method to cut the umbilical cord, and strictly disinfect scissors, cotton wool, and wrapping cloths to effectively prevent tetanus from umbilical cord injuries in calves. If chicken claw hooves are found after the calves are born, they are pinched at any time, and when they grow up, they will all have good hooves. When cows calve in winter, they are heated with fire, but the calves' eyes can be damaged by the smoke if one is not careful, so they pay attention to only heating the calves' hindquarters and sides, not directly facing the fire. In summer, strong sunlight can also easily damage the calves' eyes, so they do not allow the calves to leave the pen within seven days, and take care of them diligently day and night.

In addition, this team has also accumulated a set of experiences in the feeding, use, and protection of livestock in several years of practice. Their experience is:

(1) Rationally matching animals for work. "Animals do the same amount of work, why do some sweat more?" This was a question discovered when the animals were unharnessed. After analysis and research, it was found that animals have different temperaments, some are impatient and some are slow, and their physical condition varies from strong to weak, so they cannot be matched solely based on size. Therefore, they adjusted the matching of animals to ensure that the impatient are paired with the impatient, the slow with the slow, and the strong with the weak. Since then, the phenomenon of uneven labor has been overcome, and labor efficiency has been improved.

(2) Rationally allocating feed troughs. Based on the characteristics that "livestock have old and young teeth, and eat grass quickly and slowly," they put the old-mouthed animals in the same trough, and the young-mouthed animals in the same trough; livestock that eat grass particularly slowly or have bad habits of bullying their neighbors are fed in single troughs; and grass and fodder are added separately according to the different conditions of the livestock. After adopting this method, every animal can eat its fill.

(3) Rationally matching feed types. They have mastered the adjustment of cooling and heating, the adjustment of bitter and sweet, and the adjustment of soft and hard. The masses call this "eating colorful grass." In addition, the fodder is appropriately matched according to seasonal changes. They have also mastered some reasonable methods in feeding, such as mixing less and more frequently when mixing fodder; increasing or decreasing the amount according to the seasonal workload; and "three firsts and three lasts" when adding grass (first broken then whole, first poor quality then good quality, first grass then fodder).

(4) Rationally and appropriately timing drinking water and feeding grass. The traditional three drinks a day has now been changed to six drinks a day, adding "pre-trough water" (drinking water before eating dry grass) and "post-trough water".

(5) In terms of draft animal protection, they have achieved clean grass, clean feed, clean troughs, clean pens, clean tools, and clean livestock. Different protective measures must be taken for livestock in different seasons: prevent cold and frost in winter, prevent heatstroke in summer, prevent mosquito bites in autumn, and prevent scabies in spring.

In addition to continuously strengthening the political and ideological education of keepers on protecting, loving, and increasing livestock, and improving their collectivist thinking of cherishing public property, the Party branch of this production team has also led the members of the commune to formulate a set of rules that everyone consciously abides by, such as the "Five Fixes," "Three Timelys," "Five Comparisons," and "Three No Uses." These rules have gradually formed after encountering contradictions in practice and proposing solutions. The "Five Fixes" are: fixing grass, fixing feed, fixing manure accumulation, fixing breeding, and fixing work points for livestock raising; the team provides keepers with all necessary supplies for the timely supply of grass and fodder, manure accumulation soil, and breeding young animals according to these "Five Fixes." The "Five Comparisons" are: comparing fatness, comparing hygiene, comparing manure accumulation, comparing breeding, and comparing creation. The "Three No Uses" stipulate: cattle that are sick or do not eat grass cannot be used, cows cannot be used for ten days before and after calving, and cattle that do not ruminate while working in the fields cannot be used. According to the above regulations, they have also established a system of inspections every half month, evaluations every month, summaries every half year, and rewards and punishments every half year. For several years, all members and cadres of this production team have always adhered to these systems.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan: The Majiahu Brigade of the Shuangzha Commune in Jinji County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, has seen a net increase of 71% in large livestock from the autumn of 1957 to the present. Not only has it overcome the difficulty of insufficient power for agricultural production and transportation, but it has also been able to transfer thirty-nine head of livestock to support other teams.

The Majiahu Brigade had only 501 head of livestock in 1957, and the required draft cattle mostly relied on purchases from other places, which cost a lot of money and was sometimes not easy to obtain. According to this situation, the Party branch of the brigade (then a high-level agricultural cooperative) put forward the policy of "self-breeding, self-raising, and self-use" to vigorously breed draft animals. From the beginning, the Party branch firmly grasped the feeding management and breeding work of large livestock. Last year, a small natural mating station was established, and this year an artificial insemination station was established. In order to breed a batch of strong, good-breed, and high-breeding-rate draft animals, a perennial draft animal breeding farm was established this spring, concentrating 28 female animals for breeding. For more than two years, all female animals have been fully mated and pregnant.

According to the experience of veteran keepers, and after discussion by everyone, the Majiahu Brigade summarized a complete set of feeding methods. Keepers scientifically allocate feeding times, regularly disinfect sheds, and replace earthen troughs with lime or brick troughs. Keepers must also achieve "frequent grass additions, frequent bedding changes, frequent brushing and sweeping" and "knowing the hunger, fullness, heat, cold, and workload of livestock." According to the size and strength of the livestock, the principles of fixing workload, fixing time, fixing harnesses, and fixing users were formulated. After the livestock are used, they must be handed over to the keeper for inspection. The brigade also has epidemic prevention personnel who patrol for treatment and administer regular vaccinations. In this way, from brigade leaders to keepers, users, and epidemic prevention personnel, everyone has clear responsibilities, and every livestock is raised strong and fat. Only one old cow has died in the past two years.

    自繁自育  科学饲养  合理使用
    蒋庄队六年耕牛增五倍
    本报济南29日电　最近山东聊城专区科学技术委员会帮助聊城市北杨集人民公社蒋庄生产小队总结了耕畜繁殖饲养的丰富经验。这个生产小队从互助组到人民公社，六年来紧紧抓住了耕畜繁殖和饲养，使耕牛由五头繁殖到三十三头，增长五倍多，并且没有因病死亡现象。
    这个生产小队，现有二百四十八人，一千亩耕地。1953年常年互助组时期只有三头母牛，两头公牛。耕畜所以发展得这样快，首先是他们贯彻了自繁自育自养的方针。他们的口号是：“大牛生小牛，一头又一头，繁殖起来没有头”。
    一些老饲养员在党支部的教育下，凭着多年的丰富经验，认真作好耕畜繁殖工作。他们紧紧掌握了母畜的发情期。老母牛发情期短，他们便抓紧时间早配；壮年母牛发情期长，便在发情两天内配。在配种时间上，一般在早晨和上午，这时母畜情欲旺盛，一配就准，而且母牛出生率一般比较高。1956年以来新生母牛就占60％。在母牛生犊时，饲养人员紧紧地掌握了接犊的三个关键：剪脐带、捏蹄子、保护眼睛。他们采用新法剪脐带，剪刀、棉絮、包布等都严格消毒，有效地防止了小牛剪脐带破伤风。牛犊生下后，如发现是鸡爪蹄，就随时捏，长大了就都是好蹄脚。冬天母牛生犊烤火时，不小心会熏坏小牛眼睛，他们便注意只烤小牛后腚和两侧，不迎头烤。夏天阳光强烈，也容易晒伤小牛眼睛，因此，七天内不让小牛离圈，昼夜勤加看护。
    另外，这个小队在几年的实践中，还积累了一套对牲畜的饲养、使役、保护的经验。他们的经验是：
    （1）使役上合理配套。“牲口一样把活干，为啥有的出大汗？”这是在牲口卸套时发现的问题。经分析研究发现：牲口脾气有急缓，体质有强弱，不能光从体型大小上来搭配。因此，他们就对牲口配套进行了调整，作到急跟急，缓跟缓，强弱相等。从此，克服了劳逸不均现象，提高了劳动效率。
    （2）喂养上合理配槽。根据“牲畜牙口有老有嫩、吃草有快有慢”的特点，他们便把老口和老口的同槽，嫩口和嫩口的一起喂养；对吃草特慢或有欺邻坏习惯的牲口，单槽喂养；并且根据牲口的不同情况，分别添加草料。采用这个办法后，每个牲口都可以吃饱。
    （3）饲料种类合理搭配。他们掌握了凉热调剂，苦甜调剂，软硬调剂。群众把这叫做“吃花草”。另外，还根据季节变化，对饲草适当搭配。在喂养中也掌握了一些合理方法，如拌草料时少拌，勤拌；用量上根据季节忙闲有增有减；添草时“三先三后”（先碎后整，先孬后好，先草后料）。
    （4）饮水喂草合理适时。以往传统的每日三饮，现改为每日六饮，即加上饮“槽前水”（食干草以前饮水）和“槽后水”。
    （5）在耕畜保护方面做到了草净、料净、槽净、圈净、用具净、畜体净。在不同季节要给牲畜做好不同的防护工作：冬季防寒防冻，夏季防止中暑，秋季防止蚊虻咬，春季防止发生疥癣。
    这个生产小队的党支部，几年来除不断加强对饲养员进行保畜、爱畜、增畜的政治、思想教育，提高他们爱护公共财产的集体主义思想外，还领导社员群众定出了一套人人自觉遵守的规矩，如“五定”“三及时”“五比”“三不使”等。这些规矩都是在实践中遇到矛盾，又提出了解决办法后逐渐形成的。“五定”即对牲畜饲养定草、定料、定积肥、定繁殖、定工分；队里根据这“五定”，对饲养员作到及时供应草料、积肥土和繁殖幼畜一切必需的用品。“五比”是：比膘肥，比卫生，比积肥，比繁殖，比创造。“三不使”规定：牛病了或不吃草不能使，母牛产前产后十天不能使，田间干活不反刍不能使。根据以上这些规定，他们还定出了半月一检查，一月一评比，半年一总结，半年一奖惩的制度。几年来，这个生产小队的全体社员、干部对这些制度始终遵守不懈。
    据新华社银川讯　宁夏回族自治区金积县双闸公社马家湖大队从1957年秋天到现在，大家畜净增71％。不但克服了农业生产和运输动力不足的困难，而且还能抽调出三十九头牲口支援别队。
    马家湖大队在1957年只有五百零一头牲口，需要的役用耕畜多靠从外地购买，花钱多，有时还不容易买到。大队（当时还是高级农业社）党支部根据这种情况，就提出了“自繁、自养、自用”的方针，大力繁殖耕畜。一开始，党支部就紧紧抓住大家畜的饲养管理和繁殖工作。在去年建立了小型自然交配站，今年又建立了人工配种站。为了繁殖一批体壮、品种好、繁殖率高的耕畜，今年春天又建立常年耕畜繁殖场，集中母畜二十八头，专门进行繁殖。两年多来母畜都是全配满怀。
    马家湖大队根据老饲养员的经验，经过大家讨论，总结出了一套完整的饲养方法。饲养员科学地调配喂料时间，圈棚经常消毒，并将土槽改为石灰或砖砌槽。饲养员还要作到“勤添草、勤垫圈、勤刷扫”和“知牲畜的饥、饱、热、冷和干活轻重”。根据牲口的大小、强弱，制定了定活量、定时间、定套具、定使役人的役用原则，牲畜使用后，要交给饲养员检查。大队还设有防疫员，巡回治疗，定期预防注射。这样，从大队领导干部到饲养员、使役员、防疫员都有明确的责任，头头牲畜养得膘肥体壮，两年来只死了一头老牛。
