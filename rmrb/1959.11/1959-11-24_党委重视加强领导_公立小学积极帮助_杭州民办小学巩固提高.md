Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 22nd – While developing public primary schools, Hangzhou City has also seen significant development in private primary schools. Nearly 700 schools run by the masses throughout the city are being continuously consolidated and improved.

To meet the enrollment needs of school-age children and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses in running schools, the Hangzhou Municipal People's Committee formulated a plan for mass-run schools as early as 1956. In 1958, after the Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee and the Hangzhou Municipal People's Committee held on-site meetings on residential school management in Wulin Road Subdistrict and agricultural cooperative school management in Guashan Township in the suburbs, mass-run primary schools developed rapidly throughout the city like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Currently, Hangzhou City (including Xiaoshan and Fuyang Counties) has 697 private primary schools with over 100,300 students, accounting for 34.07% of the total number of primary school students in the city. Party organizations and education administrative departments at all levels attach great importance to mass-run schools, continuously strengthening political and professional leadership to ensure the consolidation and improvement of private primary schools.

Many public primary schools also actively support and help private primary schools to solve difficulties in teaching and equipment. Many public schools have included the work of guiding private primary schools in their school work agenda, formulating plans, absorbing private primary school teachers to participate in political, professional learning, and teaching research activities. Sometimes, public primary school teachers and private primary school teachers prepare lessons together, jointly develop lesson plans, observe each other's classes, and hold demonstration teaching activities, which have played a significant role in improving the level of private primary school teachers and the quality of teaching. All teachers of the public Zhubaoxiang Primary School in Shangcheng District are very concerned about the teaching work of the private Minsheng Road Primary School, introducing their teaching experience to the private primary school teachers without reservation, and actively introducing their used teaching aids to them, helping them solve the difficulties in tools for productive labor. The Young Pioneers Brigade also helped them build a team. With the help of public primary schools, the teaching quality of the private Shihuqiao Primary School has been significantly improved.

    党委重视加强领导　公立小学积极帮助
    杭州民办小学巩固提高
    新华社杭州22日电　杭州市在发展公办小学的同时，民办小学也有了很大的发展。全市近七百所群众举办的小学，正在不断巩固和提高。
    杭州市人民委员会为了满足学龄儿童入学的要求，充分发挥群众办学的积极性，早在1956年就制订出群众办学的方案。1958年，中共杭州市委和杭州市人民委员会在武林路街道和市郊瓜山乡分别召开居民办学和农业社办学现场会议后，全市群众办的小学就像雨后春笋般地发展起来了。现在，杭州市（包括萧山、富阳两县）已有民办小学六百九十七所，学生十万零三千多人，占全市小学生总数的34.07％。各级党组织和教育行政部门对群众办学十分重视，不断加强政治和业务的领导，保证了民办小学的巩固和提高。
    许多公立小学也积极支持和帮助民办小学解决教学工作上、设备上的困难。不少公立学校把辅导民办小学的工作列入学校工作日程，订出了计划，吸收民办小学教师来参加政治、业务学习和教学研究活动，有时，公立小学教师和民办小学教师一起备课，共同制订教案，相互听课，举行观摩教学等活动，对提高民办小学教师水平和教学质量起了显著的作用。上城区公立珠宝巷小学全体教师都很关心民办民生路小学的教学工作，把自己的教学经验毫不保留地介绍给民办小学教师，把自己用过的教具，主动介绍给他们用，帮助他们解决生产劳动上工具的困难，少先队大队还帮助他们建队。民办狮虎桥小学在公立小学的帮助下，教学质量有了显著提高。
