Profound Friendship

——Remembering the Soviet Experts Who Helped Build the First Tractor Factory
He Rong

A few days ago, China’s First Tractor Factory was born. In these joyous days, my heart is filled with gratitude, respect, and fond memories of the Soviet experts who helped build the First Tractor Factory.

Let the “Phoenix” Fly Sooner

In January 1956, the leader of the Soviet expert team, Comrade Lebkov, came to Luoyang. When he first stepped onto the site of the First Tractor Factory, it was still a snow-covered wilderness. At that time, he unfolded the general layout plan of the factory and said meaningfully to the factory director: “…We, the Soviet people who have come from the socialist road, are the most familiar with and can best understand the feelings of our Chinese friends who are embarking on the socialist road. How much I hope that tractors can be driven out of this factory soon!” The factory director said with deep emotion: “Our tractor factory can be compared to a phoenix. The Soviet people have helped us design the pattern of this phoenix, and now they have sent experts to guide us in drawing it…”

The factory director and Lebkov said almost at the same time: “We must work together to make the phoenix fly sooner!”

The old expert suffered from high blood pressure because he worked day and night to compile the general progress schedule for the construction of the factory, which would produce tractors eight months ahead of schedule. The doctor repeatedly advised him to rest, but to no avail. The factory director was worried about his health day and night.

“Comrade Lebkov, you must follow the doctor’s advice and rest for a few days.” However, the old expert refused to listen. Helpless, the factory director instructed the clerk to lock the office door. But he secretly moved his office to his dormitory.

Late at night, the stars blinked sleepy eyes. Why is the light still on in the small window across from me? Could it be that high blood pressure is preventing the old expert from sleeping? Or is he writing to his distant young son? No, why is the shadow of the ruler shaking on the wall? I walked quietly to the window and secretly looked inside, and saw the old expert leaning over the table, drawing a red line on the general progress chart, and his wife sitting next to him sharpening a pencil, her heart also melting into that red line…

Must Be Repaired

In 1958, the tractor factory entered the tense stage of equipment installation, adjustment, and trial production. At this time, the power heart of the tractor factory—the gas generator station’s gas exhaust machine—developed a serious malfunction. This not only affected the trial production of all the heat treatment workshops of the tractor factory, but also directly threatened the production of other factories being built in Jianxi District, Luoyang. At that time, some engineers and technicians advocated ordering goods from abroad.

“Don’t look down on your own things, engineer comrade, buying from abroad requires a lot of money, and it takes half a year. We can’t wait, we have to repair it ourselves!” the expert said frankly. He dragged a leg that was wounded in the Great Patriotic War and repaired the gas machine with the workers day and night. After two months of hard work, the gas machine, which was considered difficult to “cure,” was finally repaired.

August was his vacation time.

“The gas machine has been repaired, and your vacation has arrived, get ready to go on vacation,” the factory director advised him.

“No, Comrade Factory Director, I can’t go on vacation. The steel casting workshop is about to produce molten steel on ‘August 1st’. This is the first furnace of steel in the First Tractor Factory! How can I leave my work to escape the heat?”

“But you haven’t had a vacation in two years!”

“What does that matter? Vacation should be subordinate to work, and work cannot be subordinate to vacation.”

After several arguments, the factory director had to “compromise.” The workers said gratefully: “The Soviet expert elder brother is wholeheartedly for us. He doesn’t go to Lushan to escape the heat, but comes to our steel furnace at more than 1,000 degrees to ‘escape the heat’.”

Embroidering a Heart of Friendship

In 1958, expert Prokharenko came to the First Tractor Factory in Luoyang. He went to work early the next day after arriving in Luoyang. He came to the die forging section of the forging workshop and shook hands with almost all the workers in the section, as if he were as affectionate as old friends. He carefully looked at each forging machine. He saw a worker forging a red-hot part, his clothes soaked with sweat, so he took off the safety helmet from the worker’s head and put it on his own, picked up the pliers and started working, “You take a break, let me try it.” He clamped a red-hot bar, accurately placed it in the forging die, stepped on the pedal, and the hammer roared. The forging was successfully completed after rolling a few times under the hammer. The workers all gave a thumbs up and said: “The expert is really a good forger.” From then on, he was almost always on the production site, helping workers solve difficult problems in production.

In September last year, a group of new apprentices came to the forging workshop. They were all eighteen or nineteen-year-old girls who had just come from the countryside. Before they came to the factory, they envied working in a large factory. However, when they saw these large forging machines, which shook the sky when they struck, they became a little timid. Prokharenko said to them kindly: “In our Soviet Union, forgers are very respected. People respect forgers not only because they are the people who forge machine parts, but also because they are the people who create happiness.” He personally operated and demonstrated to these girls, the forging hammer went “dong, dong, da, da,” beating a rhythmic beat, “You see how skillful this is, girls, if you are ambitious, you will definitely become an excellent female forger in the future.” Later, the expert often helped them. In less than half a year, Qu Xiuhua was able to operate independently with the expert’s patient help and was rated as an excellent apprentice by the workshop. The other girls who came with Qu Xiuhua also learned to operate the forging machine with the help of experts and master workers.

In June of this year, Prokharenko completed his task and was about to return to his country. Qu Xiuhua and He Ai’ying rushed to sew for several nights, braving the hot weather, and carefully embroidered an embroidered tablecloth and a pair of embroidered pillows, which they gave to Prokharenko.

Prokharenko was extremely happy. After he returned to his country, the deep friendship formed in this common labor made him unforgettable. In three months, he sent them three letters.

### 情长谊深——记帮助建设第一拖拉机制造厂的苏联专家

    情长谊深
    ——记帮助建设第一拖拉机制造厂的苏联专家
    何嵘
    几天前，我国的第一拖拉机制造厂诞生了。在这欢腾的日子里，我的心头涌起了对帮助建设第一拖拉机制造厂的苏联专家们的感激、尊敬和亲切的回忆。
    让“凤凰”早日飞
    1956年1月，苏联专家组长列布柯夫同志来到洛阳，当他第一次踏上第一拖拉机制造厂厂区的时候，这里还是一片积雪复盖的旷野。那时，他展开建厂总平面图，意味深长地向厂长说：“……我们，从社会主义道路上走过来的苏维埃人，是最熟悉、最能体会到走上社会主义道路的中国朋友们的心情的。我多么希望拖拉机能够很快地从这个厂里开出去！”厂长深情地说：“我们的拖拉机厂可比作一只凤凰，苏联人民帮助我们设计好了这只凤凰的图样，现在又派来专家，把着我们的手教我们描绘……。”
    厂长和列布柯夫几乎一同地说：“我们要共同努力，让凤凰早日飞起！”
    老专家因为日夜编制提前八个月出产拖拉机的建厂总进度，患了高血压症。医生再三劝解也没有什么作用。厂长为他的健康日夜担心。
    “列布柯夫同志，你必须遵从医生的意见，休养几天。”可是，老专家怎么也不听。无奈何，厂长指示公务员锁上了办公室的门。而他，却偷偷地把办公室搬到宿舍里去了。
    深夜，星儿眨着困倦的眼睛。我对面的小窗户里，怎么还亮着电灯？莫非是高血压症使老专家不能安眠？还是他在给遥远的小儿子写信？不，为什么米达尺的映影在墙上摇动？我轻轻走到窗户跟前，偷偷望着里面，看到老专家伏在桌子上，在总进度表上画着一条红线，老夫人坐在旁边削着一支铅笔，她的心呵，也熔化在那条红线中……
    一定修好
    1958年，拖拉机厂进入了紧张的设备安装、调整和试生产的阶段。就在这个时候，拖拉机厂的动力心脏——煤气站的煤气排送机发生了严重的故障。这不仅影响着拖拉机厂所有热加工车间的试生产，而且也直接威胁着洛阳涧西区其他兴建工厂的生产。当时，有的工程技术人员主张另向国外订货。
    “不要看不起自己的东西，工程师同志，买外国的，一需要花很多的钱，二需要半年的时间，我们不能等待，要自己修！”专家坦率地说。他拖着一条在卫国战争中负了伤的腿，日夜和工人一起修理煤气机。经过两个月的苦战，被认为是难以“医治”的煤气机终于修好了。
    8月份，本是他休假的时间。
    “煤气机已修好了，你的假期也到了，快准备休假吧。”厂长劝他说。
    “不，厂长同志，我不能去休假。眼看铸钢车间‘八一’就要出钢水了。这是第一拖拉机厂的第一炉钢水呵！我怎能丢下工作去避暑呢？”
    “可是你两年都没有休假了！”
    “这又算什么呢？假期应该服从工作，工作不能服从休假。”
    几次的争执，厂长只好“让步”了。工人感激地说：“苏联专家老大哥一心一意为咱们，他不到庐山去避暑，到咱们一千多度的炼钢炉旁来‘避暑’了。”
    绣上友情的心
    1958年，普罗哈连柯专家来到了洛阳第一拖拉机制造厂。来到洛阳的第二天，一早就上了班。他来到锻工车间模锻工部，几乎和工部所有的工人都握了手，好像和熟悉的老朋友一样亲热。他仔细地看过了每台锻机。他看见一位工人正在锻打一个红红的零件，衣服被汗水浸透了，便从工人头上摘下了安全帽，戴在自己的头上，拿过钳子就干起来了，“你们歇歇吧，我试试看”。只见他夹过一根通红的棒料，准确地放进锻模中，脚一踩蹬板，锤头就轰鸣起来了。锻件在锤头下翻了几个滚就成功了。工人都伸出大姆指头说：“专家真是个好锻工。”从那时起，他几乎天天在生产现场，帮助工人解决生产中的疑难问题。
    去年9月间，锻工车间来了一批新徒工，她们都是刚从农村来的一些十八、九岁的姑娘。她们在来到工厂以前，羡慕在大工厂里干活好。但是，当她们看到这些大锻机，打起锤来震天动地，又有些胆怯了。普罗哈连柯亲切地对她们说：“在我们苏联，锻工非常受人尊敬，人们尊敬锻工，不仅因为他们是锻造机器零件的人，而且他们还是缔造幸福的人。”他亲自操作，表演给这些姑娘看，锻锤咚咚、哒哒，打着有节奏的点子，“你们看这多么灵巧，姑娘，有志气将来一定会成为一个出色的女锻工。”以后，专家经常地帮助她们。不到半年的时间，曲秀花在专家耐心的帮助下，已经能够独立操作，并被车间评为优秀的徒工。和曲秀花同来的其他姑娘，在专家和老师傅的帮助下，也都学会操作锻机了。
    今年6月间，普罗哈连柯完成了他的任务要回国了。曲秀花和何爱英冒着炎热的天气，飞针走线地突击了几个通宵，精心刺绣了一块绣花桌布，一对绣花枕头，赠送给了普罗哈连柯。
    普罗哈连柯高兴极了，他回国以后，这种共同劳动中结成的深厚友谊使他不能忘怀，三个月的时间，就给她们来了三封信。
