Xinhua News Agency, New York, 30th (TASS dispatch): Renowned American economists pointed out the high-speed development of Soviet industry in their reports submitted to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.

Professor Bernstein of the University of Michigan stated in his report that Soviet industrial production is undoubtedly developing at a much faster rate than that of the United States. He wrote, "A comparison of the growth trends that occurred between 1955 and 1958 is particularly favorable to the Soviet Union and unfavorable to the United States." In the Soviet Union, resources are fully utilized, and the utilization of labor and investment always maintains a high speed, without production stoppages. But "in the market economy of the United States, production stoppages often occur due to the recession of business activities and labor-management conflicts." Bernstein concluded that the Soviet economy will continue to develop and will surpass the American economy.

Professor Boddy of the University of Minnesota said in another report that the Soviet Union's production and its national income appear to be approaching the production and income levels of the United States soon, if the United States cannot greatly accelerate its economic development. Boddy pointed out that Khrushchev's plan to expand Soviet national income based on the Seven-Year Plan is entirely realistic. "Even if these forecasts of Soviet development are underestimated, the growth rate can still bring the Soviet Union close to the American level in national income and products in the near future, if our recent growth rate does not accelerate significantly."

Peterson, a representative of the Committee for Economic Development (an organization of big business owners), expressed doubt in the report whether the American economy can greatly improve its growth rate if it remains as it is now. Peterson admitted that the Soviet economy is developing much faster than the United States, and will soon catch up with the American economy. He said: "The annual growth rate of the Soviet Union's total national product in the past decade has greatly exceeded that of the United States. The average absolute annual growth rate of the Soviet Union's total national product is lower than that of the United States. However, it is approaching our absolute growth rate, and if it maintains the recent growth rate, it will soon surpass us."

Winnard of Edison Electric Institute wrote in his report, "We believe that the Russians have made great achievements in building power plants. They manufacture excellent turbines and generators. The products they manufacture are very good. We believe that the Russians can manufacture larger machines. We believe that the Russians are also authoritative in building transformer stations and erecting transmission lines. They have many very good scientific research institutes." Reberm of the Indiana Farmers Organization gave high praise to the Soviet collective farmers' determination to further develop agriculture in a comprehensive review. He wrote, "Russian farmers believe that the country needs them. Every achievement they make is recognized by the government. They believe that the Russian system is the best system and can guarantee to surpass us in product quantity and quality... American farmers feel that they are abandoned..."

    美国著名经济学家向国会作报告
    苏联经济很快就要超过美国
    几点对比
    苏联工业生产高速发展  美国企业活动陷于衰退
    苏联资源得到充分利用  美国生产经常发生停顿
    苏联农民受到政府表彰  美国农民则感到被遗弃
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社纽约30日讯：美国著名经济学家在提交国会联合经济委员会的报告中指出了苏联工业的高速度发展。
    密执安大学教授伯恩斯坦在他的报告中指出，苏联工业生产毫无疑问地以比美国工业生产快得多的速度发展着。他写道，“1955年到1958年期间出现的增长趋势的比较对苏联特别有利，而对美国不利。”在苏联，资源得到充分利用，劳动力和投资的利用永远保持着很高的速度，不会发生生产停顿。而“在美国那种市场经济的情况下，由于企业活动衰退和劳资冲突，常常出现生产停顿”。伯恩斯坦得出结论说，苏联的经济将继续发展，它将超过美国经济。
    明尼苏达州大学的博迪教授在另一篇报告中说，苏联的生产和它的国民收入看样子很快就接近美国的生产和收入水平，如果美国不能大大加快它的经济发展速度的话。博迪指出，赫鲁晓夫提出的在七年计划基础上扩大苏联国民收入的计划是完全现实的。“即使对苏联发展的这些预报再低估一些，增长速度仍然可以使苏联在国民收入和产品方面在不久的将来就接近美国水平，如果我们最近出现的增长速度不大大加快的话。”
    “争取经济发展委员会”（大企业主的组织）的代表彼得逊在报告中表示怀疑，美国经济要是像目前这个老样子能否大大提高自己的增长速度。彼得逊承认，苏联经济发展比美国快得多，而且不久就可以赶上美国经济。他说：“俄国最近十年来的全国总产值每年的增长率大大超过了美国的增长率。俄国全国总产值的平均绝对年增长率低于美国。但是，它正在接近我国的绝对增长率，如果保持最近出现的增长速度，那么它很快就会超过我们。”
    埃迪逊电气研究所的温纳德在自己报告中写道，“我们认为，俄国人在建设发电站方面获得了很大的成就。他们制造出优良的涡轮机和发电机。他们制造的产品非常好。我们认为，俄国人能制造更大的机器。我们认为，在建设变压器站和架设输电线方面，俄国人也是权威的。他们有很多非常好的科学研究所。”印第安纳州农场主组织的雷贝姆在一篇综合述评中对苏联集体农民决心进一步发展农业给予很高的评价。他写道，“俄国农民认为，国家需要他们。他们所获得的每一成就都得到政府的表彰。他们认为，俄国制度是最好的制度，并能保证在产品数量和质量方面赶过我们……美国农民则感觉自己是被遗弃的……”
