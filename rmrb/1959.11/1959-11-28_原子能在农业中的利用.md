The use of atomic energy in agriculture, according to preliminary research results, has special effects on stimulating crop production, eliminating pests, improving varieties, and storing agricultural products.

        A New Method to Stimulate Increased Production
    In 1932, two Czech scientists discovered an interesting phenomenon: in the volcanic regions of Italy, the air and soil contained trace amounts of radioactive materials, which resulted in bountiful harvests in the orchards and vineyards year after year. Similarly, it was also discovered that the flowers, plants, and trees near radium factories were more lush. They believed that this was due to the stimulation of radioactive rays.
    Radioactive rays include α, β, and γ rays. In agriculture, β and γ rays are most widely used. The source of the rays is mostly isotopes or natural radioactive materials produced by atomic reactors.
    Irradiating seeds with rays can increase production. The method is to place the isotope in a tube and use the rays it emits to irradiate the seeds. The Soviet Institute of Biophysics used the isotope cobalt-60 to irradiate carrot seeds in this way. After planting, the yield increased by 20% to 25%, and the growth period was shortened by about a week. Irradiating pea seeds can also increase the number of pods by 33%.
    If isotope solutions are used to soak seeds, the seeds can also be stimulated by the rays. Isotope phosphorus-32 was used to soak seeds, which increased the yield of sugar beets by more than 40% in potted plants and nearly 10% in the field. Similarly, soaking seeds such as winter wheat and corn can increase production.
    Another method is to apply isotopes or natural radioactive materials as trace fertilizers to the soil. Some people applied very small amounts of isotope phosphorus-32 to the soil, which increased grape production by more than 20%. Using natural radioactive materials as trace fertilizers is also effective. Soviet scientists used it to conduct more than 500 experiments on 71 kinds of crops, and found that 25 kinds of crops increased production by 20% to 40% or even more, 35 kinds of crops increased production by 10% to 20%, and the other 11 kinds of crops increased production by less than 10%. This shows that the effect of increasing production is very significant.
    Using isotopes for foliar topdressing—that is, spraying on the leaves—can also increase crop production due to the stimulation of rays. Soviet scientists sprayed a very dilute solution of isotope phosphorus-32 on winter wheat with airplanes during the flowering period, which increased the yield of wheat on a large area by 10%.
    The above three treatment methods can not only increase yield, but also improve the quality of crops. Soviet and Chinese scientists have found that winter wheat can improve its cold resistance after being irradiated, and grows quickly and vigorously after overwintering. Irradiated sugar beets, in addition to increasing production, also have increased sugar content. In addition, the results of experiments on tomatoes, cotton, and other crops have shown that they not only increase production, but also shorten the growth period and mature 7 to 10 days earlier.

        The Scientific Principles of Increased Production
    Research shows that low doses of radioactive rays can activate neutral water molecules, activate the intermediate products of photosynthesis, and strengthen the oxidation-reduction reactions in plant metabolism, thereby promoting seed germination, increasing chlorophyll content, and enhancing the ability of photosynthesis. Soviet scholar Fulasyuk pointed out that the photosynthetic capacity of many crops increases by 30%-60% after being irradiated, especially on cloudy days and at low temperatures that are unfavorable for photosynthesis, which can better show its promoting power. We know that the intensity of photosynthesis directly determines the yield.
    If radioactive materials are applied to the soil, they can also stimulate the activity of microorganisms. For example, after isotope phosphorus-32 is applied to the soil, the activity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria is doubled. The number of bacteria also increases by more than ten times. The prosperity of microorganisms is very beneficial to crop growth.
    Therefore, small doses of radioactive rays can indeed stimulate crop production (large doses will inhibit growth and even cause death). The effect of increasing production is also related to other nutritional conditions. The better the other conditions, the greater the ability to stimulate production. Of course, this work is still in the experimental stage, especially in terms of protection. Applying radioactive materials (even in very small amounts) to the soil or plants must take into account whether it has any impact on the health of humans and animals.

        A New Type of Weapon for Pest Control
    Pests are the great enemies of mankind. In order to eliminate pests, we often use various chemical agents and biological protection methods. Now, in the age of atomic energy, we have mastered a new type of weapon.
    In addition to being used to detect enemy situations, clarify the life history, distribution, and habits of pests, radioactive isotopes can also be directly used to kill pests. Experiments have proved that isotope cobalt-60 can kill eight kinds of grain pests in granaries. Soviet scientists have also designed a strong emitter of isotope cobalt, which can kill pests in 30 tons of grain in one hour. Isotopes can also be injected into tree trunks to eliminate pests hiding inside.

        Variety Improvement and Others
    To improve varieties, shaking the heredity of crops is the primary task. In addition to using the method of hybridization of different organisms to achieve this goal, in the past ten years, various physical and chemical factors such as low temperature, high temperature, reduced air pressure, anesthetics, and colchicine have been found to be used to stimulate plants to produce variations. Atomic energy is undoubtedly a new force in this regard. Radioactive rays can be used to irradiate plants, causing variations, and then new varieties with excellent qualities can be obtained through selection and breeding.
    In the Soviet Union, some new varieties have been cultivated using this method. Such as awnless barley, early-maturing cabbage, large-grained peas and soybeans, flax and sesame with high fiber yield, wheat with high protein content, etc.
    In the storage of agricultural products, the ease of sprouting of potatoes, onions, and garlic is the most troublesome. People have been looking for a substance that can prevent its germination, and radioactive rays have this ability.
    The Bakh Institute of Biochemistry in the Soviet Union used isotope cobalt-60 to irradiate stored potatoes, which did not germinate within a year and did not damage their nutritional value.
    In addition, some people use radioactive rays to kill silkworm pupae in cocoons. In plant physiology, entomology, and agricultural scientific research, isotopes are also an indispensable helper. People call it "tracer atoms".
    During the Great Leap Forward last year, with the help of the Soviet Union, China built its first atomic reactor, and has since stepped into the arch of the atomic age, which has also laid the foundation for the application of atomic energy in China's agriculture. The Yantan People's Commune in Lanzhou, with the help of scientific research institutions, is conducting experiments on using isotopes to soak seeds to stimulate growth. The Department of Biology of Peking University and the Beijing Institute of Plant Physiology are also organizing manpower to carry out research in this area. It can be predicted that atomic energy will surely make contributions to agriculture in our country.

    原子能在农业中的利用
    朱相远
    原子能在农业中的利用，根据目前初步的研究成果看来，无论对刺激作物增产，消灭害虫，改良品种，农产品贮藏等，都有特殊的效能。
        刺激增产的新方法
    1932年，捷克的两位科学工作者，发现了一个有趣的现象：在意大利的火山区，由于空气及土壤中混有微量的放射性物质，而使得那儿的果园、葡萄园年年喜获丰收。同样又发现提制镭的工厂附近，花草树木也更为繁茂。他们认为这是由于放射性射线刺激的缘故。
    放射性射线有α，β，γ三种。在农业中以β，γ射线运用最广。射线的来源大都是原子反应堆的产物——同位素或天然放射性物质。
    用射线来照射种子，可以增产。方法是把同位素安置在一个管子里，利用它所放出的射线来照射种子。苏联生物物理研究所，就曾这样用同位素钴60来照射红萝卜种子，种下后比未照过的增产二成到二成半，生长期也缩短一周左右。用来照射豌豆种子，也能使豆荚增加33％。
    如果利用同位素溶液来浸种，也一样能使种子受到射线的刺激。曾用同位素磷32浸种，使甜菜在盆栽下增产四成多，在大田里也增产近一成。同样来浸冬小麦、玉米等种子，都能增产。
    另一种方法是把同位素或天然放射性物质，当作微量肥料施于土壤之中，有人把很微量的同位素磷32施于土中，而使葡萄增产二成多。若用天然放射物质来做微量肥料也一样有效。苏联科学家就用它对七十一种作物进行了五百多个试验，发现增产二成到四成以至更多的有二十五种作物，增产一成到二成的有三十五种作物，另外十一种作物增产在一成以下。由此可见，增产的效果是十分显著的。
    用同位素来做根外追肥——即喷撒于叶子上，作物也能因射线的刺激而增产。苏联科学家曾在冬小麦扬花时，用飞机喷射极稀的同位素磷32溶液，使得大面积上的小麦皆增产一成。
    以上三种处理方法，不仅能够提高产量，并且还能改善作物的品性。苏联和我国的科学工作者，都发现冬小麦被照射后，能提高抗寒能力，越冬后长得既快又茁壮。被照射过的糖用甜菜，除了增产外，含糖量也有所增加。另外如西红柿、棉花等，试验结果都发现既增产又缩短了生长期，提早成熟七到十天。
        增产的科学原理
    研究表明，原来低剂量的放射性射线，可以活化中性的水分子，活化光合作用的中间产物，使植物新陈代谢中的氧化还原作用加强，这样就促进了种子的萌发，提高了叶绿素的含量，增强了光合作用的能力。苏联学者甫拉修克指出，不少作物在被照射后，光合作用能力就增强30％—60％，尤其是在对光合作用不利的阴天及低温下，就更能显示出它的促进力量。我们知道，光合作用的强度是直接决定产量的。
    如把放射性物质施在土壤里，还能刺激微生物的活动。比如土壤中施入了同位素磷32后，固氮菌的活动力就增强一倍。细菌的数目也增加十几倍。而微生物的繁盛，对作物生长是大为有利的。
    因此不大剂量的放射性射线，确实能够刺激作物增产（剂量大了就反而抑制生长，以至死亡）。增产的效果还和其它营养条件有关。其它条件越佳，刺激增产的能力越大。当然，目前这项工作还仍处在试验阶段，特别在防护问题上。把放射性物质（尽管量很小）施于土壤或植物里，就必须要考虑到它对人畜健康有无影响。
        灭虫的新式武器
    害虫是人类的大敌，为了消灭害虫，我们常用各种化学药剂和生物防护等方法。如今在原子能的时代里，我们又掌握了一种新式武器。
    放射性同位素除了用来侦查敌情，弄清害虫的生活史、分布、习性而外，还能直接用来杀死害虫。经试验证明，同位素钴60，就能杀死谷仓中的八种粮食害虫。苏联科学工作者还设计出一种同位素钴的强烈发射器，一小时内，可以杀除三十吨谷物中的害虫。用同位素还可以射入树干，消灭窝藏在里面的害虫。
        改良品种及其它
    要想改良品种，动摇作物的遗传性是个首要的工作。人们除了利用不同生物杂交的方法来达到这一目的以外，近十年来又发现各种物理因素、化学因素如低温、高温、降低气压、麻醉剂、秋水仙素等，可以用来刺激植物产生变异。而原子能无疑又成了这方面的新生力量。可以用放射性射线来照射植物，引起变异，然后经过选择培育就能获得品性优良的新种。
    在苏联已用这个方法培育出一些新品种。如无芒的大麦，早熟的甘蓝，大粒的豌豆、大豆，出麻率高的亚麻、胡麻，含蛋白质多的小麦等等。
    在农产品贮藏中，对于土豆、洋葱、大蒜头的易于出芽，最感头痛。人们一直在寻找一种物质，能够制止它的发芽，而放射性射线就有这个本领。
    苏联巴赫生物化学研究所曾用同位素钴60来照射贮藏的土豆，一年之内不发芽，而且并不损害其营养价值。
    此外还有人用放射性射线来杀死蚕茧中的蚕蛹。在植物生理学、昆虫学以及农业科学研究中，同位素又是一个必不可少的帮手。人们称之为“示踪原子”。
    去年大跃进中，在苏联帮助下，我国建成了第一座原子反应堆，从此跨入了原子时代的拱门，也为原子能在我国农业中运用打下了基础。兰州的雁滩人民公社，就在科学研究机关的帮助下，进行利用同位素来浸种而刺激生长的试验。首都的北京大学生物系、北京植物生理研究室也在组织人力进行这方面的研究工作。可以预料，原子能也一定能在我国农业中建立功勋。
