Figures and Facts

    The Abacus Speaks

    The members of the Qijia Miaozi Village People's Commune in Linqu County, Shandong Province, recently calculated comparative accounts of grain output and commune members' income in different periods:

    1951 (Mutual Aid Team): Average grain yield per mu was 209 jin, with an average of 560 jin of grain and 45 yuan in cash per person.

    1954 (Elementary Cooperative): Average grain yield per mu was 304 jin, with an average of 660 jin of grain and 61 yuan in cash per person.

    1956 (Advanced Cooperative): Average grain yield per mu was 336 jin, with an average of 730 jin of grain and 63 yuan in cash per person.

    1958 (Establishment of the People's Commune): Average grain yield per mu was 377 jin, with an average of 780 jin of grain and 97 yuan in cash per person.

    1959 (The first year of communization): Average grain yield per mu was 409 jin, with an average of 823 jin of grain and 136 yuan in cash per person.

    The more this account was calculated, the clearer it became in everyone's mind. The common opinion was: Mutual aid teams brought small increases in production, agricultural cooperatives brought large increases, and people's communes brought comprehensive increases.

    More Depositors in Banks

    On a market day in Qingfengdian, Ding County, Hebei Province, groups of male and female commune members with shoulder bags and baskets crowded the office of the Qingfengdian Commune Bank, vying to complete deposit procedures.

    At night, accountant Wu settled the day's total deposits for the entire commune: 183,103 yuan. He opened the general ledger and reviewed the development of farmers' savings over the years: In 1957, there were 7,869 depositing households, accounting for 35 percent of the total households in the commune; in 1958, the number of depositing households rose to 11,017, accounting for 49 percent of the total households; now, in the first year of the people's commune, the number of depositing households has increased to 17,716, accounting for 79 percent of the total households, with an average deposit of 47.8 yuan per household.

    数字与事实
    算盘说话
    山东省临朐县营子人民公社齐家苗子村的社员们，最近算了几个不同时期粮食产量和社员收入的比较账：
    一九五一年（互助组），平均亩产粮食二百零九斤，平均每人占有粮食五百六十斤、现金四十五元；
    一九五四年（初级社），平均亩产粮食三百零四斤，平均每人占有粮食六百六十斤、现金六十一元；
    一九五六年（高级社），平均亩产粮食三百三十六斤，平均每人占有粮食七百三十斤、现金六十三元；
    一九五八年（人民公社成立），平均亩产粮食三百七十七斤，平均每人占有粮食七百八十斤、现金九十七元；
    一九五九年（公社化第一年），平均亩产粮食四百零九斤，平均每人占有粮食八百二十三斤、现金一百三十六元。
    这一笔账，越算心里越亮堂，大家共同的意见是：互助组小增产，农业社大增产，人民公社全面增产。
    银行里存户多
    河北省定县清风店的一个集日，一群群背褡裢、提筐篮的男女社员挤满了清风店公社银行的办公室，争着办理存款手续。
    入夜，吴会计结算了这一天全社的存款：十八万三千一百零三元。他打开总账，翻阅了几年来农民储蓄发展的情况：一九五七年，存款的有七千八百六十九户，占全社总户数的百分之三十五；一九五八年，存款户上升到一万一千零一十七户，占总户数的百分之四十九；现在，人民公社化的第一年，存款户增加到一万七千七百一十六户，占总户数的百分之七十九，平均每户存款达到了四十七元八角。
