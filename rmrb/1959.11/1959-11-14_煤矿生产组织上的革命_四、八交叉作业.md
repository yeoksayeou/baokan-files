A revolution in coal mine production organization: Four-Eight Staggered Shifts

All kinds of production organizations must adapt to the production characteristics of various industries in order to promote production. The characteristics of coal industry production organization are: single product, multiple types of work, multiple processes, multiple tools, and constantly moving workplaces. For a long time, a three-shift system has been generally adopted in the production organization of coal mining enterprises. Basically, single-line operations are carried out between shifts, between work types, and between processes, with long production gaps; at most, only sixteen hours of coal mining are carried out in a twenty-four hour day. Looking at the work of a single shift, due to the lack of staggered shifts, a certain amount of time must be taken for shift handover; after each shift takes over, a period of preparation work for coal mining must be done, such as transporting pit props and drilling blasting holes. Looking at the production process, the workload of each process and each type of work is uneven; some workloads are large, requiring more people; some workloads are small, requiring fewer people. For example, drilling, blasting, and coal cutting have small workloads and require fewer people; coal shoveling, pillar support, and moving electric conveyors have large workloads and require more people. When drilling, blasting, and coal cutting, more than half of the coal shovelers have nothing to do and can only shovel coal after the coal is cut and blasted. When shoveling coal, the workload is large, and the labor force feels insufficient.

The "four (shifts), eight (hours)" staggered shift production system divides the original three shifts into four shifts on the basis of the original labor and equipment: each shift's working time is still eight hours, with a certain amount of staggered shift time between shifts. Its main feature is that coal mining and preparation work can be carried out in a staggered manner, that is, the next shift goes down the well two hours early to prepare for coal mining without waiting for the previous shift to finish mining. When the previous shift has worked for eight hours and is about to go up the well, the next shift's preparation work has already been completed within the staggered shift time. In this way, continuous coal production can be basically achieved. Except for individual processes (such as moving electric conveyors), which require three to four hours each day, the time for coal production each day can reach about twenty hours, an increase of more than six hours compared to the three-shift system, greatly utilizing space, increasing the utilization rate of working hours, and fully utilizing the production capacity of the coal mining face and the efficiency of mechanical equipment. At the same time, on the one hand, staggered operations can be carried out to the greatest extent between various processes and various types of work, such as staggered coal mining and rock roof fall, staggered moving of electric conveyors and rock roof fall, staggered drilling and coal shoveling; on the other hand, it adapts to the uneven workload of various processes and various types of work, and adjusts the labor force accordingly. This increases coal production and labor productivity and reduces costs. According to the promotion in Zibo, Yangquan, Kailuan, Fushun and other coal mines this year, the effect is good. After the implementation of the 4009 coal mining face in Zibo Xiazhuang Mine, the monthly output increased from the original 5,829 tons to 10,715 tons, an increase of 83.8%. After the implementation of the Yangquan Satellite Coal Mining Team, the monthly output increased from the original 9,616 tons to 15,464 tons, an increase of 61%. After the Fushun Victory Mine No. 5 mining area implemented this experience, the daily output increased from the original 465 tons to 630 tons, an increase of 35%. Due to the increase in output from the working face, labor productivity has been greatly improved and production costs have been reduced. According to the situation of several units, production efficiency has generally increased by 15% to 35%, and the cost of raw coal has been reduced by 10% to 15%. For example, the working efficiency per person in the Yangquan Satellite Coal Mining Team increased from the original 5.656 tons to 8.156 tons, an increase of 44%, and the cost per ton of raw coal decreased from 1.67 yuan to 1.37 yuan, a decrease of 18%.

Another major advantage of implementing "four-eight" staggered shifts is that it can better enable employees to have both work and rest, and always maintain a full revolutionary drive, creating important conditions for the continuous high-speed development of the coal industry. The coal industry involves a lot of heavy physical labor. In addition to the normal working hours of the coal mining face, it also takes a certain amount of time to walk from the wellhead to the coal mining face after going down the well. Moreover, as the production years of the mine increase and the roadways continue to extend, the time spent walking back and forth also gradually increases. In order to shorten the time workers spend walking underground, coal mining enterprises have actively improved mine transportation conditions, but this can only be shortened to a certain extent. After the implementation of "four-eight" staggered shifts, due to the full utilization of space and time, the abnormal state of being slack in the beginning and tight at the end has been changed, and an order of rhythmic and balanced production has been established, which can better achieve both work and rest. At the same time, due to the increase in the number of shifts, each shift of workers has a certain amount of time to see sunlight and a certain amount of night sleep time, which is beneficial to the health of the workers. Therefore, the implementation of "four-eight" staggered shifts has been warmly praised by the vast number of workers. The workers said with satisfaction: "With the implementation of 'four-eight' staggered shifts, we get enough sleep, and we have more time for study and entertainment. When we go to work, we are more motivated." Because the workers have sufficient rest time and are full of energy, sick leave has been greatly reduced. According to the statistics of several units, the attendance rate has generally increased by 5% to 10% compared to the past.

The implementation of "four-eight" staggered shifts is more conducive to strengthening unity between shifts and further promoting the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration. In coal mine production, if one production link is disconnected, it will inevitably affect all production links. Therefore, various production links, various types of work, and various shifts (groups) must support each other, cooperate closely, and create conditions for each other. "Four-eight" staggered shifts have closely connected the relationships between shifts and between people, making it easier to understand and cooperate with each other. During staggered shifts, because there are more people and the strength is concentrated, it is easier to concentrate superior forces to solve certain difficult problems. For example, in the Fushun Victory Mine No. 5 mining area, one shift transports pit props, the distance is 460 meters, and it takes eight people three hours to work. If the pit props cannot be transported quickly and in time, it will directly affect production. It is difficult to complete the task relying on the strength of one shift. After the implementation of staggered shifts between the upper and lower shifts, it is possible to concentrate forces to transport the pit props at once. Some workers said: "Now we don't distinguish between you and me, we just jump in and do it."

"Four-eight" staggered shifts are still a new working method in coal mine production. Although it has only been adopted in some enterprises for a short time, it has fully demonstrated its great superiority and it is very necessary to vigorously promote it in coal mining enterprises.

    煤矿生产组织上的革命——四、八交叉作业
    各种生产组织必须适应各种行业的生产特点，才能推动生产。煤炭工业生产组织的特点是：产品单一、多工种、多工序、多工具和工作场所不断移动前进。长期以来，在煤矿企业的生产组织上，普遍采用着三班作业的制度。各班之间、各工种之间、各工序之间基本上是单行作业，生产间隙长；每天二十四小时内，最多只有十六小时进行采煤。再从一个班的工作来看，由于班与班没有交叉作业，因此必须拿出一定的时间进行交班、接班的工作；每次接班后，又要做一段采煤的准备工作，如运坑木、打炮眼等。再从生产过程来看，各工序和各工种的工作量大小是不均衡的，有的工作量大，需要人多；有的工作量小，需要人少。例如打眼、放炮和割煤工作量小，需要人少；攉煤、支柱和移动电溜子工作量就大，需要人就较多。当打眼、放炮和割煤的时候，占二分之一以上的攉煤工就无事可做，只有等到割了煤，放了炮以后，才去攉煤。攉煤时，由于工作量大，劳动力又感不足。
    “四（班）、八（小时）”交叉作业的生产制度，是在原有劳动力和设备的基础上，将三班划分成四班：每班的工作时间仍为八小时，班与班之间有一定的交叉作业时间。它的主要特点是采煤和准备工作可以交叉进行，即不等上一班采完煤，下一班就提前两小时下井，进行采煤的准备工作。当上一班工作到八小时要上井的时候，下一班的准备工作已经在交叉作业的时间内完成了。这样，就基本上可以做到连续出煤。除个别工序（如移动电溜子）每天需要占去三到四小时之外，每天出煤的时间可以达到二十小时左右，比三班作业增加六小时以上，大大的利用了空间，提高了工时利用率，使采煤工作面的生产能力和机械设备的效能得到充分的发挥。同时，一方面可以在各工序、各工种之间，最大限度地进行交叉作业，如采煤与放落岩石顶板交叉、移动电溜子与放落岩石顶板交叉、打眼与攉煤交叉等；另一方面，又适应各工序、各工种工作量不均衡的情况，在劳动力上进行调整。这就提高了煤炭产量和劳动生产率，降低了成本。根据今年淄博、阳泉、开滦、抚顺等煤矿推行情况来看，效果是良好的。淄博夏庄矿在4009采煤工作面推行后，月产量由原来的五千八百二十九吨提高到一万零七百一十五吨，提高了83.8％。阳泉卫星采煤队推行后，月产量由原来的九千六百一十六吨提高到一万五千四百六十四吨，提高了61％。抚顺胜利矿五采区推行这一经验后，日产量由原来的四百六十五吨提高到六百三十吨，提高了35％。由于工作面产量的提高，大大提高了劳动生产率和降低了生产成本。根据现有几个单位的情况来看，生产效率一般都提高了15％到35％，原煤成本降低10％到15％。如阳泉卫星采煤队每人工作效率由原来的五点六五六吨提高到八点一五六吨，提高了44％，每吨原煤的成本由一点六七元降低到一点三七元，降低了18％。
    推行“四、八”交叉作业的另一个重大的优点，是能够更好地使职工有劳有逸，经常保持充沛的革命干劲，为持续高速度发展煤炭工业创造重要条件。煤炭工业笨重体力劳动较多，除了采煤工作面正常的作业时间以外，下井以后，由井口到采煤工作面，还需要走一定的时间。而且随着矿井生产年限的增加和巷道的不断延长，往返走路的时间也逐渐增多。为了缩短工人在井下走路的时间，各煤矿企业虽然积极改善了矿井的运输条件，但只能缩短到一定的限度。实行“四、八”交叉作业后，由于能够充分利用空间和时间，改变了前松后紧不正常的状态，建立起有节奏地均衡生产的秩序，就可以更好地实现有劳有逸。同时，由于增加了班次，每班工人每天在井上有一定的时间见到阳光和有一定的夜间睡眠时间，有利于工人的身体健康。因此，实行“四、八”交叉作业的地方，都得到了广大工人的热烈赞扬。工人满意地说：“实行‘四、八’交叉作业，觉睡得足了，学习和娱乐的时间也多了，上了班，干劲更大了”。由于工人有了充足的休息时间，精力充沛，因而病假大大减少。根据几个单位的统计，出勤率一般都比过去提高了5％到10％。
    实行“四、八”交叉作业，更有利于加强班与班之间的团结和进一步发扬共产主义大协作的精神。在煤矿生产中，如果一个生产环节脱节，就必然影响各个生产环节。因此，各生产环节之间，各工种之间，各班（组）之间，必须互相支援，密切协作，互相创造条件。“四、八”交叉作业，密切了班与班、人与人的关系，更便于互相了解，互相协作。在交叉作业时，因为人员较多，力量集中，更便于集中优势兵力解决某些困难的问题。如抚顺胜利矿五采区一班运坑木，距离有四百六十米，需要八个人工作三个小时，如果不能迅速及时地把坑木运到，就直接影响生产。这单靠一个班的力量完成任务是困难的。实行上下两班交叉作业后，就可以集中力量一次把坑木运来。有的工人说：“现在不分你我了，插手就干”。
    “四、八”交叉作业在煤矿生产中，还是一个新的工作方法。目前它虽然只是在部分企业中开始采用，而且为时不久，但已充分显示了它的巨大的优越性，很有必要在煤矿企业中大力推广。
