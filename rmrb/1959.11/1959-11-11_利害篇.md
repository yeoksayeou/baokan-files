Title: On Profit and Loss

After the Great Leap Forward, some people started discussing "profit" again with a new topic. Things like the Great Steel Smelting and the large-scale experimental fields were not worth the losses, too much basic construction in the countryside was not cost-effective, and so on, coming from the mouths of some right-wingers.

Was the Great Leap Forward unprofitable or less profitable? In the past month, in the rural areas of Guangdong, I heard many farmers' discussions. These commune members of the People's Commune refuted the above fallacies with concrete facts from individuals, households, teams, and communes. The commune members had many thought-provoking things to say, and I was particularly enlightened by these three accounts:

First, "When calculating, the eye must be in the center, only with eyes open can you calculate clearly." That is to say, when calculating gains and losses, you must listen in all directions and look far ahead. You cannot only look at the small and not the big; only look at the near and not the far; only look at one point and not the rest. There was a production team with a densely planted field that did not increase production, and another that decreased production. However, the average yield per mu of densely planted fields in the entire team was 690 jin, more than half the increase compared to the original 450 jin yield per mu of sparsely planted fields, and one field even reached 1,012 jin per mu. If you only see the former and shout that dense planting is "more loss than gain", how can you not be wrong? This team worked hard for a month to build a large reservoir. This year, when fighting drought, opening the sluice gate solved the problem, saving more labor than the construction of the reservoir, and guaranteeing a bumper harvest. The labor saved can then be used for other production, increasing a lot of income. Furthermore, this reservoir can be used for many years. "A moment of hardship brings a thousand times of joy, a year of construction brings ten thousand years of happiness", isn't this truly a profitable venture?!

Second, "In the past, we tilled the fields to death, and every year we harvested so little. Last year, once we emancipated our minds, we ventured east and west, and achieved a thousand jin per mu!" "In the past, building a brick wall in the village required finding people from outside; now this large dining hall (also a meeting hall) that can accommodate more than a thousand people was built entirely by ourselves last year after breaking superstitions!" Using a year's effort, we swept away the inferiority complex left over from thousands of years and gained the infinitely beneficial four big red characters of "Dare to think and dare to do." This great profit cannot be calculated with numbers.

Third, profit and harm are revealed in opposition, so calculating profit must also calculate harm. A commune calculated the accounts of two brigades. One brigade engaged in production and construction last year and benefited greatly. The other brigade only cared about distributing more, eating more, and using more, and did very little construction. There were ten major projects that should have been built but were not, such as reservoirs, fish ponds, fertilizer plants, and sugarcane processing plants. Because these ten major projects were not built, this year's income was reduced by more than 10,000 yuan. The commune members attending the commune member representative meeting said, "This is a great loss." Is the Great Leap Forward beneficial or harmful? This one example is enough to answer without reservation.

It is very clear: in our era of building socialism, how should we view and calculate profit and loss?

    利害篇
    李稚
    大跃进后，有些人又以一个新的话题议论起“利”来。什么大炼钢铁、大搞试验田得不偿失呀，农村基本建设太多，不划算呀，什么什么赔本呀，诸如此类，出自一些右字号的人之口。
    大跃进是否无利或少利？近一月来，我在广东的农村，听到不少农民的议论。这些人民公社的社员们，纷纷以一人、一户、一队、一社的具体事实，驳倒了上述谬论。社员们有很多话，说得发人深省，其中特别使我深受教益的，有这样三笔账：
    第一、“算字写来目在中，张耳开目才算通。”就是说，计算得失时要耳听八方，眼望千里。不能只看小的，不看大的；只看近的，不看远的；只看一点，不及其余。有个生产大队有一片密植田没有增产，还有一片减产了，可是，全队密植田平均亩产六百九十斤，比原来疏植田产量四百五十斤增加一半还多，而有块田亩产达到了一千零一十二斤。只看到前者就叫喊密植“几多一少（收获）”，怎能不错误呢？这个队苦战了一个月，建成一个大山塘。今年抗旱，一打开水闸就解决问题，节省了比筑山塘时更多的劳动力，保证了丰收。而节省下来的劳动力，又可大搞其他生产，增加了不少收入。还有，这山塘又可以用许多年。“一时辛苦千时乐，一年建设万年福”，这不是真真正正的一本万利么？！
    第二、“过去耕死一世田，年年割到的都是那么一点，去年一思想解放，东闯西闯，闯出了千斤亩。”“过去村里砌一条砖墙都要到外处找人；现在这座容一千多人的大饭堂（又是会堂），就是去年打破迷信，全靠自己动手建起来的！”用一年的功夫，扫除了几千年遗留下来的自卑感，取得了受用无穷的“敢想敢干”四个大红字。这笔大利，决不是用数字能够计算得出的。
    第三、利是和害在对立中显现出来的，所以，算利也要算害。有一个公社算了两个大队的账。一个大队去年搞了生产建设，得益很大。另一个大队则只顾多分多吃多用，建设甚少，应建可建而没有建的就有山塘、鱼塘、肥料厂、蔗茅加工厂等十大件。由于这十大件没有建成，就使今年少收入一万多元。参加公社社员代表大会的社员们说：“这是一个很大的损失”。大跃进有利还是有害？只此一例，也足以回答无遗。
    这就很清楚了：在我们建设社会主义的时代，应该怎样看待和计算利害。
