    Communes Can Run Chemical Plants Well
    Shangzhuang Chemical Plant Uses Agricultural and Sideline Products to Produce More Than Twenty Kinds of Chemical Products
    (Our Newspaper) Report: The Shangzhuang Chemical Plant of Shangzhuang People's Commune in Xushui County, Hebei Province, which began construction at the end of August last year, has developed from being rudimentary to more sophisticated and has become a comprehensive chemical plant. The plant now has more than 500 employees and twelve workshops, producing more than twenty kinds of chemical products. The total output value this year can reach more than 1.7 million yuan.
    The production of this plant mostly uses agricultural and sideline products as raw materials, implementing comprehensive utilization; the products produced in turn serve agriculture. They use sweet potatoes and corn to produce butanol, acetone, and starch; use starch to produce glucose and syrup; use starch residue to produce alcohol; use alcohol to produce chloro-oil; and use chloro-oil to produce Dipterex. They use corn cobs as raw materials to produce furfural; use furfural residue and waste liquid to produce activated carbon and sodium acetate; use sodium acetate to process into acetic acid; and use acetic acid to further produce a series of chemical products such as naphthalene acetic acid. The pesticides and rubber products they produce have played an important role in ensuring this year's bumper agricultural harvest.

    公社能够办好化工厂
    商庄化工厂利用农副产品等生产出二十多种化工产品
    本报讯　河北省徐水县商庄人民公社在去年8月底开始建设的商庄化工厂，已经由土到洋，发展成为一个综合性的化工厂了。这个厂现在有五百多个职工，十二个车间，生产二十多种化工产品，今年总产值可以达到一百七十多万元。
    这个厂的生产，绝大部分利用农副产品作原料，实行综合利用；生产出来的产品又为农业服务。他们用红薯和玉米生产丁醇、丙酮和淀粉；用淀粉生产葡萄糖和糖浆；用淀粉渣生产酒精；用酒精生产氯油；又用氯油生产敌百虫。用玉米芯作原料生产糠醛；用糠醛渣、废液生产活性炭、醋酸钠；用醋酸钠加工成醋酸；用醋酸再生产萘乙酸等一系列化工产品。他们生产的农药、橡胶制品等，对保证今年的农业丰收起了重要作用。
