Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 24th: The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Education Department recently held an on-site conference on agricultural middle schools in Heng County to discuss how to further consolidate and develop agricultural middle schools, so as to cultivate more junior technical personnel for the development of agricultural production and the realization of agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification in a short period of time.

Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region's agricultural middle schools have seen significant development. According to incomplete statistics, as of now, there are 503 agricultural middle schools in various parts of the region, with a total of 46,996 students. By implementing the policy of part-work and part-study, combining teaching with productive labor, these agricultural middle schools not only meet the masses' demand for cultural learning and the needs of higher primary school graduates for further education, but also cultivate a group of junior agricultural technical personnel with socialist consciousness and secondary school education for the countryside. Therefore, agricultural middle schools have become new schools that are supported by parents, satisfied by students, and welcomed by cadres. The masses praise agricultural middle schools as "studying and working, learning for application, saving money for the country, and benefiting oneself." This on-site conference summarized the achievements of agricultural middle schools throughout the region, analyzed the current excellent situation, and believed that with the continued leap forward in production, the demand for technical personnel in rural areas is increasing day by day. It is necessary to thoroughly criticize the right-leaning thoughts of some people who are wavering and doubting the two-pronged approach to running schools, and actively develop, consolidate, and improve agricultural middle schools.

The conference proposed that local areas should, based on production conditions, mass demands, the number of teachers, etc., formulate appropriate plans for the development of agricultural middle schools on the basis of giving play to subjective initiative, mobilize the masses to implement the principles of adapting to local conditions, being flexible and diverse, and being simple and economical, and actively run agricultural middle schools jointly by communes, brigades, or several brigades.

The conference proposed that the key to consolidating and improving agricultural middle schools lies in strengthening the Party's leadership, strengthening political and ideological work, doing a good job in teaching and productive labor, improving the quality of teaching, and gradually achieving financial self-sufficiency or semi-self-sufficiency. The conference also pointed out that agricultural middle schools should carry out agricultural scientific research work, adhere to part-work and part-study, and establish their own bases for productive labor and agricultural production experiments through reclamation or allocation by communes, use advanced technology, and strive for high yields and bumper harvests, so that the schools become bases for promoting advanced agricultural technologies in the local area. The conference also studied the curriculum setting of agricultural middle schools, believing that in addition to the current four courses of politics, Chinese language, mathematics, and basic agricultural knowledge, physics and chemistry courses should be added in the future. Where conditions permit, courses related to agricultural mechanization, electrification, and rural industry can be gradually added.

Two hundred and thirty-one people attended the conference, including responsible cadres from the cultural and educational departments of various special zones, cities, and counties of the autonomous region, as well as principals and teacher representatives from agricultural middle schools in various counties. The conference listened to a typical report by the Heng County Party Committee on consolidating and developing agricultural middle schools, an introduction to the experiences of some agricultural middle schools in Heng County, and organized visits and discussions.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 24th: Strengthening the Party's leadership over agricultural middle schools and following the mass line, Heng County, Guangxi, provides some experience for running agricultural middle schools well. Since the county started agricultural middle schools in May and June last year, thanks to the Party Committee's strengthened leadership, reliance on the masses, and active development, while consolidating and improving, in a short period of one year, the county has established twenty-three agricultural middle schools. All twenty-one communes in the county have established agricultural middle schools, and some communes have two or three agricultural middle schools.

Heng County's agricultural middle schools are run in a variety of forms. Some are jointly run by communes and brigades, some are jointly run by several brigades, and some are run by a single brigade. This year, the number of students enrolled in secondary schools run by the masses and public junior middle schools has reached 73% of the county's eligible higher primary school graduates. Agricultural middle schools are universally praised by the masses.

The good performance of Heng County's agricultural middle schools is mainly due to the consistent active leadership and strong support from Party committees at all levels. In the early stage of establishing agricultural middle schools, the County Party Committee not only held special meetings to study the development of agricultural middle schools, but also conducted multiple studies on the school's operational policies, the land required for school labor, the arrangement of teaching and productive labor, student life, school funding, and the training and allocation of teachers, and made unified arrangements. The Party committees of various communes included running agricultural middle schools well on their work agenda. While focusing on production, they often cared about the work of agricultural middle schools and helped solve some major practical problems in a timely manner. For example, the two secretaries and the propaganda and cultural and educational committee members of the Mashan Commune Party Committee inspected the work of agricultural middle schools every time they went to the countryside and returned, and helped solve problems in a timely manner. Many communes also had Party committee secretaries and propaganda committee members concurrently serve as principals of agricultural middle schools, and transferred capable cadres to the schools to take on teaching and leadership work. Some brigades specially sent veteran farmers to agricultural middle schools to serve as technicians, responsible for guiding the school's labor production. Many commune party committee secretaries often gave reports at the schools, and some even taught political classes at agricultural middle schools to strengthen political and ideological education for teachers and students.

Heng County's development of agricultural middle schools has followed the mass line from beginning to end. The school buildings, equipment, funding, teachers, and production bases of agricultural middle schools in the county were all solved by mobilizing and relying on the masses under the leadership of the Party committee, based on the principles of self-reliance, utilizing local materials, learning from those who are capable, and running schools diligently and thriftily. If there were insufficient school buildings and equipment, they relied on the masses to contribute labor and materials to build school buildings and make school furniture themselves; if there were insufficient production bases, they organized teachers and students to reclaim wasteland, engage in sideline production, or return to the brigades to participate in labor; if there was a shortage of cattle and labor tools, they adopted methods such as borrowing from the brigades, exchanging labor with the brigades, or having students bring their own. The commune party committees often convened cadre meetings, mass meetings, and consulted with the masses to gain their support and help agricultural middle schools overcome difficulties. Some communes also established a board of directors composed of brigade party branch propaganda committee members and parent representatives to handle major teaching issues in agricultural middle schools. The roof of the school building of Dongxu Agricultural Middle School in Qiaoyi Commune was leaking and the doors and windows were dilapidated. The brigade members spent more than ten days to repaint the school building and allocated land, cattle, horses, bullock carts, and other agricultural tools, enabling the school's teaching and labor production to proceed smoothly. The masses said: "We run our own schools."

Continuously improving the quality of teaching is the central link in consolidating agricultural middle schools. The county once held a series of meetings to study the issue of improving the quality of teaching in agricultural middle schools, organized forces to conduct in-depth inspections of the teaching situation in schools, and designated special personnel to lead the teaching work in agricultural middle schools. At the same time, measures such as running short-term training courses, organizing agricultural middle school teachers to attend classes in public middle schools, and participating in correspondence and spare-time teacher training were adopted to systematically improve the professional level of agricultural middle school teachers.

Now, agricultural middle schools in Heng County have generally established complete school buildings and production bases, established normal teaching systems, students are diligent and eager to learn, and love labor; teachers work with peace of mind and teach conscientiously. Because attending agricultural middle school allows students to learn both cultural knowledge and production skills, at a low cost and close to home, it is universally welcomed by cadres and the masses. The masses praise agricultural middle schools as "the vanguard of production and the locomotive of the cultural revolution."

    办好农业中学　为农业技术改造培养人材
    广西农业中学做到大家满意
    横县提供的好经验正在全自治区推广
    新华社南宁24日电　广西僮族自治区教育厅最近在横县召开农业中学现场会议，讨论如何进一步巩固和发展农业中学问题，以便在短时间内为发展农业生产，实现农业机械化、水利化、化学化、电气化培养出更多的初级技术人材。
    广西僮族自治区农业中学已有重大发展。据不完全统计，到目前为止，全区各地已办农业中学五百零三所，在学人数达四万六千九百九十六人。由于贯彻了半耕半读、教学与生产劳动相结合的方针，这些农业中学既满足了群众学习文化的要求和高小毕业生升学的需要，又能为农村培养一批具有社会主义觉悟和中学文化程度的初级农业技术人材。因此农业中学成为家长拥护、学生满意、干部欢迎的新学校。群众称赞农业中学：“读书劳动，学以致用，国家省钱，自己得益”。这次现场会议总结了全区农业中学的成绩，分析了当前的大好形势，认为随着生产的继续跃进，农村需要的技术人材日益增多，必须彻底反掉一些人对两条腿走路办学方针表现动摇、怀疑的右倾思想，积极发展、巩固、提高农业中学。
    会议提出，各地应根据生产情况、群众要求、师资数量等，在发挥主观能动性的基础上，制订发展农业中学的适当规划，发动群众贯彻因地制宜、灵活多样、因陋就简的原则，由公社、大队或几个大队联合积极举办农业中学。
    会议提出，巩固和提高农业中学的关键，在于加强党的领导，加强政治思想工作，搞好教学和生产劳动，提高教学质量，逐步实现经费自给、半自给。会议并指出农业中学应开展农业科学研究工作，坚持半工半读，通过开荒或公社拨给等办法，建立自己的生产劳动和农业生产实验的园地，使用先进技术，力争高产丰收，使学校成为当地推广先进农业技术的基地。对农业中学的课程设置，会议也作了研究，认为除目前的政治、语文、数学、农业基础知识等四门课外，以后还应增加理化课。有条件的地方，可以逐步增加有关农业机械化、电气化以及农村工业等方面的课程。
    参加这次会议的有自治区各专区、市、县文教部门负责干部，各县农业中学校长和教师代表二百三十一人。会议听取了横县县委关于巩固发展农业中学的典型报告，横县部分农业中学的经验介绍，并组织了参观和讨论。
    新华社南宁24日电　加强党对农业中学的领导，走群众路线，广西横县为办好农业中学提供了一些经验。这个县从去年5、6月间创办农业中学以来，由于党委加强领导，依靠群众，积极发展，边巩固边提高，短短的一年间，全县办了二十三所农业中学，全县二十一个公社，社社办了农业中学，有的公社有两、三所农业中学。
    横县农业中学办学形式多种多样，有的由公社和大队合办，有的由几个大队联合办，也有一个大队办一所的。今年群众办的中等学校和公办初中的招生人数，已达全县适龄高小毕业生的73％。农业中学受到群众的普遍赞扬。
    横县农业中学办得好，主要是由于各级党委一向积极领导，大力支持。在农业中学创办初期，县委不但召开了专门会议，研究农业中学的发展问题，对农业中学的办学方针，学校劳动所需的土地，教学与生产劳动的安排，学生的生活，学校的经费，师资的培养和配备等，县委都多次进行研究，作了统一的部署。各公社党委把办好农业中学列入工作议程，在抓生产的同时，经常关心农业中学的工作，及时帮助解决一些重大的实际问题。如马山公社党委两个书记和宣传委员、文教委员等，每次下乡和回来，都对农中的工作进行检查，及时帮助解决问题。许多公社还由党委书记、宣传委员兼任农业中学的校长，抽调得力干部到学校担任教学和领导工作。有的大队专门派老农到农中担任技术员，负责指导学校的劳动生产。许多公社党委书记经常到学校作报告，有的还到农业中学讲授政治课，对师生加强政治思想教育。
    横县发展农业中学，自始至终走群众路线。这个县各农业中学的校舍、设备、经费、师资和生产基地等，都是根据自力更生、就地取材、能者为师、勤俭办学的原则，在党委领导下发动群众、依靠群众解决的。校舍设备不够，他们就依靠群众献工献料建筑校舍，自己动手制造校具；生产基地不够，就组织师生开荒，搞副业生产，或者回大队参加劳动；耕牛、劳动工具缺乏，就采取向大队借、和大队换工或者由同学自带的办法解决。公社党委经常召开干部会、群众会和群众商量，争取群众支持，帮助农业中学克服困难。有的公社还由大队党支部宣传委员和家长代表成立校董会，处理农业中学教学上的重大问题。校椅公社东墟农业中学的校舍屋顶漏雨，门窗破烂，大队社员们用十多天的工夫就把校舍粉刷一新，并且拨来了土地、耕牛、马、牛车以及其它农具，使学校的教学和劳动生产都能顺利进行。群众说：“自己的学校自己办”。
    不断提高教学质量是巩固农业中学的中心环节。这个县曾经召开一系列的会议研究提高农业中学的教学质量问题，并组织力量深入检查学校教学情况，指定专人领导农业中学的教学工作。同时，采取开办短期训练班，组织农业中学教师到公办中学听课和参加函授、业余师范学习等办法，有计划地提高农业中学教师的业务水平。
  现在，横县各农业中学普遍建立了完整的校舍和生产基地，建立了正常的教学制度，学生勤奋好学，热爱劳动；教师安心工作，认真教学。由于上农业中学既能学到文化知识，又能学到生产技术，花钱少，校址近，受到干部和群众的普遍欢迎，群众称赞农业中学是“生产的先锋，文化革命的火车头”。
