Mobilizing Peasants to Design Water Conservancy Projects
Dazu County's Large, Medium, and Small Reservoirs Blossom All Over, Construction Progresses Quickly, Costs are Low
Jiangxi Promotes Yushan’s “July 1st” Reservoir Experience to Improve Project Quality

(Our Chengdu dispatch, November 27th) Sichuan's Dazu County, in its vigorous water conservancy construction movement, has mobilized everyone to learn technology, thereby overcoming the difficulty of insufficient technical strength in the county.

Since the realization of communization in October of last year, water conservancy construction in Dazu County has advanced by leaps and bounds. In the past year, thirty-four large, medium, and small reservoirs have been started in the county (twenty-one of which have been completed). The scale of the reservoirs is much larger than before. After all are completed, they can irrigate 500,000 mu of farmland. The storage capacity is 2.8 times greater than the total storage capacity of water conservancy projects built in the nine years after liberation. Together with the original water conservancy facilities, 85% of the county's cultivated land can be irrigated.

In the full-scale water conservancy construction, Dazu County encountered the difficulty of insufficient technical strength: the county only had six water conservancy technicians and only three leveling instruments. This made some people lack confidence in building large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, and some emphasized that they must ask the higher authorities for engineers and a large number of technical cadres. Based on the actual situation, the Dazu County Committee of the Communist Party of China led the masses to launch a debate on "relying on the higher authorities or relying on ourselves" and put forward the slogan "go to the masses to find Lu Ban." In this way, 52 farmers with rudimentary water conservancy knowledge were selected from various communes in the county, and a short-term technical training class was opened with six water conservancy technicians as teachers. Facts have proved that these "Lu Bans" quickly mastered the basic techniques of surveying and design and the use of simple instruments. At the same time, Red and Expert Technical Schools were established on a large scale on the construction sites, and methods such as "teachers leading apprentices, skilled workers leading novices, training on the front line, learning what to do, and specializing in specific tasks" were adopted to create a mass upsurge in learning technology. Twenty-seven Red and Expert schools were established throughout the county, training more than 3,000 technical personnel of various types. Many construction sites also set up various professional training classes according to their own needs. For example, the upstream reservoir construction site held training classes on earth dam design and construction, channel surveying and construction, and stone mining and blasting, with nearly 400 people mastering various techniques. In key surveying, design and construction, thirteen district-level leading cadres in the county actively studied and mastered the construction technology of earth dams and water discharge equipment, and ten people understood surveying and design knowledge. Among the ninety commune leading cadres, thirty-six mastered the construction technology of earth dams and water discharge equipment. Most of the 34 reservoirs in the county were surveyed and designed by the masses themselves; only a few large-scale and technically complex projects were assisted by technicians sent by the county. The Shengguang Reservoir, built by the Gaosheng Commune, which can irrigate 12,000 mu of farmland, was designed and constructed by a management area cadre and a farmer technician. The engineering quality of this reservoir is now very good. The Xihu Reservoir, which can irrigate more than 50,000 mu of farmland, was also surveyed and designed by three farmer technicians leading more than a dozen farmers in four days. The 34 reservoirs in the county took less than a month to complete the surveying and design work and immediately started construction in full swing.

After the technology was handed over to the broad masses, people were more enthusiastic and more responsible. These farmer water conservancy technicians, after repeated surveys, compared various design schemes, and studied and improved construction methods, thus better implementing the policy of building water conservancy projects diligently and thriftily. According to the method of planning, designing, constructing, and reviewing simultaneously, all projects were reviewed one by one after construction. During the review, farmer water conservancy technicians climbed mountains and ridges, visited elderly farmers, and solicited opinions from the masses, thus making surveying, design, and construction more reasonable. According to statistics, after repeated revisions of the design, the irrigation area was expanded by 210,000 mu compared with the original plan, the construction of earth and stone was reduced by 2.79 million cubic meters, 1.39 million workdays were saved, 830,000 yuan was saved, and the occupied area was reduced by more than 17,000 mu.

Because the broad masses have mastered technology, a high tide of technical revolution has quickly been set off on the water conservancy construction sites throughout the county. Many local methods and improved tools were created by the masses, solving the difficulty of the lack of instruments and tools, improving work efficiency, and accelerating the progress of the project. Farmer technician Ai Shuxin created a method of measuring rainfall area by combining clocks and pace measurement, using flower poles to fix points instead of theodolites and compasses to measure rainfall area, and using bamboo earth leveling instruments instead of instruments for measurement, solving the problem of insufficient instruments. Farmer technicians Gu Bo'an and Gu Yunfu in Shima District not only did a good job in surveying and designing reservoirs, but also successfully trial-produced non-sulfur explosive chaff cannons, tile cannons, etc. during construction, saving more than 690 yuan. Various factories were also set up on a large scale on the water conservancy construction sites throughout the county to solve the problem of insufficient materials and equipment by themselves. More than 30 kinds of improved tools were manufactured throughout the county, totaling more than 20,000 pieces, eliminating carrying by shoulder and back, and the average work efficiency was more than three times higher than last year.

(Our Nanchang dispatch, November 27th) Jiangxi Yushan County's "July 1st" Reservoir ensured excellent project quality while improving work efficiency.

The "July 1st" Reservoir is the largest water conservancy project in Yushan County. After completion, it can irrigate more than 300,000 mu of farmland. The project started in the middle of last year. Now the flood interception dam has been basically completed, the giant culvert has been installed, and more than 40% of the 80-li long channel has been completed. According to inspection, the quality of the completed projects is very good. The Jiangxi Provincial Water Conservancy and Electricity Department recently held an on-site meeting here to promote the experience of this reservoir in improving project quality.

Strengthening leadership by the construction site Party committee is the primary guarantee for improving project quality. As soon as the project started, the construction site Party committee established a project quality inspection committee, led by the Party committee secretary, and absorbing technical personnel and experienced migrant workers. The Party organizations of each migrant worker brigade and team established project quality inspection teams, which patrolled the construction site day and night to check the project quality.

Mobilizing the masses to offer advice and adopt local methods has improved project quality and saved materials and funds. For example, the original design of the culvert was square, which required a lot of steel and cement. Later, migrant workers and technicians were organized to discuss and change the culvert to a round shape, saving 30 tons of steel and 50 tons of cement, and the structure was more solid, more pressure-resistant, and the quality of the culvert was improved. Another example is the channel construction project, in which the migrant workers put forward more than 100 important suggestions, improving the quality of the channel, and shortening the project by 10 kilometers compared with the original plan, saving more than 100,000 yuan. Because the construction site Party committee fully utilized the wisdom of the masses, the masses put forward more than 10,000 rationalization proposals and used more than 5,000 local methods since the start of construction, which greatly improved project quality and saved a total of more than 1,000 tons of cement and 50 tons of steel.

According to the rationalization proposals of the masses and the experience of water conservancy construction in previous years, the construction site Party committee formulated a series of technical measures for each project in accordance with the design requirements. For example, the following measures were taken in the construction of the flood interception dam: 1. Using pure clay and yellow soil to build the core wall of the dam, and using one-meter-thick bluestone blocks to protect the inner and outer slopes, making the dam body more solid; 2. Using a ten-thousand-jin stone roller to roll the soil layer of the dam, rolling each layer of soil back and forth three to five times, so that the layers of soil are tightly compacted to prevent leakage; 3. Building a seven-meter-high water interception wall at the bottom rock layer of the dam to prevent leakage from the bottom of the dam and make the dam foundation more stable; 4. Adding a ten-meter-thick rock protection slope on the outer slope of the dam to prevent the flow from damaging the outer slope caused by the excessively high infiltration line; 5. Deeply digging into the rock layer between the mountain slopes connected to both ends of the dam, so that both ends of the dam penetrate into the soil and rocks in the mountain to prevent seepage along the dam. In addition, the construction site also established a migrant worker construction responsibility system, with responsibility for different sections, divisions of labor, and team contracting, to strengthen the migrant workers' sense of responsibility for construction.

The "July 1st" Reservoir improved project quality while constructing at high speed, which is a great achievement after opposing right-leaning and exerting full effort. The construction site Party committee raised the issue of ensuring project quality at the beginning of construction, but some people debated endlessly at the time. Some people said: "To be fast, you can't be good." Some said: "We have never built such a large reservoir before, and we cannot guarantee the quality." In response to these erroneous ideas, the construction site Party committee organized cadres and migrant workers to conduct a wide-ranging debate on the topic of whether it is necessary and how to ensure and improve project quality. After the debate, everyone realized the importance of ensuring project quality and came up with many specific methods.

    发动农民设计水利工程
    大足县大中小水库遍地开花建设进度快成本低
    江西推广玉山“七一”水库提高工程质量经验
    本报成都27日电　四川大足县在大搞水利建设运动中，发动人人学技术，从而克服了全县技术力量不足的困难。
    大足县从去年10月实现公社化以来，水利建设突飞猛进。一年来，全县动工兴建的大中小水库三十四座（已完工二十一座），水库规模比以往大得多，全部完工以后，可灌田五十万亩，蓄水量比解放后九年兴修水利工程总蓄水量增加二点八倍；加上原有的水利设施，全县占85％的耕地都可以得到灌溉。
    大足县在全面动工修水利中，遇到了技术力量不足的困难：全县仅有水利技术员六人，只有三架水平仪。这样就使部分人对搞大、中型水利工程缺乏信心，有人强调必须向上级要工程师和大量技术干部。中共大足县委根据现实情况出发，领导群众展开“靠上级还是靠自己”的辩论，并提出“到群众中去找鲁班”的口号。就这样，从全县各公社选出有粗浅水利知识的农民五十二人，以六名水利技术员为教师，开办了短期技术训练班。事实证明，这些“鲁班”很快就掌握了有关勘测设计的基本技术和简单仪器的使用。与此同时，在工地上大办红专技术学校，采取“以师带徒、以熟带生、火线练兵、干啥学啥、专人专业”等办法，掀起群众性的学习技术热潮。全县办红专学校二十七所，训练出各种技术人员三千多名；许多工地还根据本身需要，开办各种专业训练班，如上游水库工地举办了土坝设计施工、渠道测量施工、采石爆破训练班，有近四百人掌握了各种技术。在重点勘测设计施工中，全县十三名区级领导干部积极钻研，都掌握了土坝和放水设备施工技术，有十人懂得了勘测设计知识，公社领导干部九十人中，有三十六人掌握了土坝和放水设备施工技术。全县三十四座水库，大部分是群众自己勘测设计的；仅个别规模较大、技术复杂的工程，才由县派技术员加以协助。高升公社修建的能灌田一万二千亩的胜光水库，是由一个管理区干部和一个农民技术员自己动手设计施工的，现在这座水库的工程质量很好。能灌田五万多亩的西湖水库，也是由三个农民技术员带领十多个农民，以四天时间勘测设计出来的。全县三十四座水库，仅用了不到一个月时间便完成勘测设计工作，立即全面投入施工。
    在技术交给广大群众以后，人们积极性更高，责任心更强。这些农民水利技术员经过反复查勘，比较各种设计方案，研究改进施工方法，因而更好地贯彻了勤俭办水利的方针。根据边规划、边设计、边施工、边复查的办法，施工以后，全部工程都逐一进行了复查。在复查中，农民水利技术员翻山越岭，走访老年农民，征询群众意见，因而使勘测设计和施工更加合理。据统计，全县经过反复修改设计，灌溉面积比原计划扩大二十一万亩，施工土石则减少二百七十九万方，节省一百三十九万个劳动日，节约费用八十三万元，缩小占地面积一万七千多亩。
    由于广大群众掌握了技术，因而技术革命的高潮很快在全县水利工地上掀起。许多土办法和改良工具被群众创造出来，解决了仪器和工具缺少的困难，提高了工效，加快了工程进度。农民技术员艾书新创造了用钟表与步测结合测集雨面积法，用花杆定点法代替经纬仪罗盘测集雨面积和用竹制土水平仪代替仪器测量，解决了仪器不足问题。石马区农民技术员顾伯安、顾云甫二人，不仅搞好水库的勘测设计，而且在施工中试制成功无磺炸药糠壳炮、瓦块炮等，节约费用六百九十多元。全县水利工地上还大办各种工厂，自己动手解决物资器材不足问题。全县制造各种改良工具三十多种，共计两万多件，消灭了肩挑背背，平均工效比去年提高三倍以上。　（孙跃冬、唐德卫）
    本报南昌27日电　江西玉山县“七一”水库在提高工效的同时，保证了工程质量优良。
    “七一”水库是玉山县最大的一座水利工程，建成后，可以灌溉三十多万亩农田。工程于去年年中动工，现在拦洪坝已基本建成，巨型涵管也已安装就绪，八十华里长的渠道已经完成了40％以上。据检查，已建成的工程的质量都很好。江西省水利电力厅最近在这里召开了现场会议，推广这个水库提高工程质量的经验。
    工地党委加强领导，是提高工程质量的首要保证。工程一开工，工地党委就成立了工程质量检查委员会，党委书记挂帅，吸收技术人员和有经验的民工参加。各民工大队、小队党组织都成立了工程质量检查组，日夜在工地巡回检查工程质量。
    发动群众出谋定计，采用土办法，提高了工程质量，节省了器材、资金。例如原设计的涵管是方型的，需要钢筋、水泥很多，后来组织民工和技术员一起讨论，把涵管改成圆型，节省了三十吨钢筋和五十吨水泥，而且结构更加牢固，耐压力更强，提高了涵管的质量。又如修渠道工程，民工们提出了一百多条重要建议，提高了渠道的质量，还比原计划缩短了十公里工程，节省了十万多元资金。由于工地党委充分发挥了群众的智慧，开工以来群众提出了一万多条合理化建议，使用了五千多个土办法，大大提高了工程质量，共节约了一千多吨水泥和五十吨钢筋。
    工地党委根据群众的合理化建议和往年兴修水利的经验，按照设计要求对各个工程分别制定了一系列的技术措施。如在拦洪坝施工中采取了：一、用纯粘土和黄土建筑坝的夹心墙，使一米厚的青石块护内坡和外坡，使坝身更加坚固；二，用万斤重的石滚筒滚压坝的土层，每层土来回压三次至五次，使层层土压得紧，防止渗漏；三、在坝底岩石层建筑一道七米高的截水墙，防止坝底渗漏，坝基更为稳固；四、在坝的外坡上加修一层十米厚的岩石护坡，以防止浸润线过高引起的流水浸坏外坡；五、在坝的两端接山的山坡间，深挖到岩石层，使坝的两端深入到山内土石中，防止沿坝渗漏。此外，工地上还建立了民工施工责任制，分段分工分队包干负责，以加强民工施工的责任心。
      “七一”水库在高速度施工的同时提高了工程质量，是在反透右倾、鼓足干劲之后取得的巨大成绩。工地党委在开工时提出了保证工程质量的问题，当时部分人议论不休。有的人说：“要快就不能好。”有的说：“我们过去从来没有建过这样大的水库，保证不了质量。”针对这些错误思想，工地党委以是否需要和怎样保证与提高工程质量为题，组织干部、民工广泛地开展了大辩论。经过辩论，大家认识到了保证工程质量的重要意义，想出了许多具体办法。
