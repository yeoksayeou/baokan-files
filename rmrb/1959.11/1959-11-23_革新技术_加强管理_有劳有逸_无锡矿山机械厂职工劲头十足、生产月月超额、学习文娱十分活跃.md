Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 22nd: The Wuxi Prospecting Machinery Plant, in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, pays attention to the combination of work and rest, ensuring a comprehensive and sustained leap forward in production with basically no overtime.

Since the beginning of this year, the plant has exceeded its monthly output value and production plans every month, and has completed its annual manufacturing task of one hundred and sixty prospecting machines seventy-eight days ahead of schedule. In terms of product quality, the forging finished product rate reached 99.98%, and the casting scrap rate dropped to about 8%.

From the plant headquarters to the workshops and work sections, every effort is made to organize and guide the workers' increasingly high enthusiasm towards clever work. Each workshop put forward the slogan "Innovate every item, tap the potential of every piece," and technicians, apprentices, auxiliary workers, and technical personnel all participated in the technical innovation campaign. In September and October, the entire plant achieved a total of one hundred and twenty-six relatively significant technical innovations, many production bottlenecks were broken through, and production efficiency was generally improved. For example, the milling and planing team in the metalworking workshop processed a batch of drilling rig parts. If a planer was used, only three hundred pieces could be completed per day, which could not complete the task on schedule. Feng Kunfa, the milling and planing team leader, discussed with worker Zhang Xingsheng and installed a high-speed milling cutter head on the shaper, and the daily output immediately increased to one thousand two hundred pieces. The task originally scheduled to be completed in seven days was completed in three days. When the October task was assigned, some cadres in the assembly workshop asked the plant for overtime. The Party Branch did not agree. After the workshop leaders returned to the workshop, they mobilized the workers to reorganize the labor organization and improve the process flow and operation. As a result, the monthly assembly task was completed six days ahead of schedule without overtime.

The factory also ensures the combination of work and rest by improving enterprise management work such as planning, scheduling, and material supply. Since September, the work plan for the next month has been issued to the workshop before the 25th of the month, and the workshop issues it to the team and individuals before the 28th of the month, so that the team and individuals have more time to discuss and revise the plan and prepare for production. They also established a scheduling meeting twice a week. Leading cadres go to the workshops every day to inspect production and treat the beginning of the month as the end of the month. At the same time, they strengthened the leadership of logistical support and mobilized supply and marketing personnel to "find rice to cook" and prepare sufficient "food and grass." For example, if the supply of some steel was insufficient, they actively coordinated with fraternal factories and transferred more than 30 tons of steel, accounting for more than 20% of consumption. The factory also purposefully and systematically organized technical personnel to go to the workshops to solve key production problems together with workers and improve management systems. This guarantees normal production from a management and organizational point of view, basically eliminating overtime.

The Party Branch of the factory is also extremely concerned about the workers' rest and life. The factory designated a factory director to be in charge of workers' lives and organize workers' recreational and study activities. The factory has established football teams, basketball teams, table tennis teams, opera troupes, national orchestras, and song and dance troupes. These sports and recreational organizations have fixed activity times every week and often organize various competitions and variety shows. Through these activities, workers can rest more happily. At present, every worker in the plant can have eight hours of sleep and six to eight hours of rest. The attendance rate of all employees in the factory has reached more than 89%, and everyone has a lot of enthusiasm for production.

    革新技术  加强管理  有劳有逸
    无锡矿山机械厂职工劲头十足、生产月月超额、学习文娱十分活跃
    据新华社南京22日电　无锡探矿机械厂在增产节约运动中，注意劳逸结合，在基本上不加班加点的情况下，保证生产全面持续跃进。
    今年以来，这个厂月月超额完成产值和产量计划，已经提前七十八天完成了今年全年一百六十台探矿机的制造任务。产品质量方面，锻件成品率达到99.98％，铸件废品率降到8％左右。
    这个厂从厂部到车间、工段都千方百计地把群众日益高涨的干劲组织和引导到巧干方面来。各车间提出“项项搞革新，件件掘潜力”的口号，无论技工、徒工、辅助工、技术人员都卷入了技术革新运动。九、十两个月份，全厂共实现了一百二十六项较为重大的技术革新，许多生产关键被突破，生产效率普遍提高。如金工车间铣刨小组加工一批钻机配件，如果用刨床刨每天只能完成三百块，不能如期完成任务。铣刨组长冯坤发就和工人张杏生一起商量，在牛头刨床上装上一把高速铣刀头，日产量立即提高到一千二百块。原定七天完成的任务三天就全部完成了。10月份任务下达时，装配车间有些干部向厂部要求加点。党总支没有同意，车间领导干部回车间后就发动职工重新调整了劳动组织，改进了工艺路线和操作，结果在没有加班加点的情况下，提前六天完成了全月的装配任务。
    工厂还从改进计划、调度、材料供应等企业管理工作上来保证劳逸结合。从9月份开始，下一个月的作业计划都在25日前下达到车间，车间在28日前下达小组和个人，这样使小组和个人就有比较充裕的时间讨论修订计划，作好生产准备工作。他们还建立了两天一次的调度会议，领导干部天天下车间巡回检查生产，把月初当作月底抓。同时加强了对后勤工作的领导，发动供销人员，“找米下锅”，备足“粮草”。如部分钢材数量供应不足，他们就主动与兄弟厂进行调剂，调进钢材三十多吨，占耗用量的20％以上。工厂还有目的有计划地组织技术人员下车间与工人一起解决生产关键问题，改进管理制度。这就从管理上组织上保证了正常生产，基本上消除了加班加点现象。
    工厂党总支对工人的休息和生活也极为关怀。工厂指定一个厂长专管职工生活，组织工人的文娱和学习活动。厂内成立了足球队、篮球队、乒乓球队、锡剧队、国乐队、歌舞队。这些体育文娱组织每周都有固定的活动时间，经常组织各种比赛和文艺晚会。通过这些活动，使工人能休息得更加愉快。目前，全厂每个职工都能有八小时的睡眠和六至八小时的休息时间。全厂职工出勤率达到89％以上，大家生产劲头很足。
