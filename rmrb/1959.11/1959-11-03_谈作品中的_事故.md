    Talking about "Accidents" in Works
    Yang Dafa, Xi'an State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 4, Shaanxi

    I am a worker and I love literature, especially works that describe the industrial front. With the Great Leap Forward in production, there are more and more works written about industrial themes. These works praise the Great Leap Forward in production, praise the heroes on the production front, and play a role in inspiring, motivating, and promoting the Great Leap Forward.

    After reading a lot, I feel there is a problem that needs to be raised and discussed with the writers. That is: "Accidents in production" often become an important plot point in some works, used to highlight characters and express them. For example:

    When writing about steel factories, accidents often happen suddenly, with smoke billowing, sparks flying, and the entire blast furnace and workshop about to be destroyed in an instant. At this time, the hero in the author's pen appears, plunging into the rolling hot stream regardless of his own safety, saving the workshop or blast furnace, but he himself is burned. Or, while steel or iron is being smelted, the furnace suddenly breaks down. It should be cooled down before it can be repaired, but the author's hero, in order to seize every minute and second to produce more steel, drills into the furnace belly with temperatures of five or six hundred degrees to repair the furnace. Or, a gasoline warehouse suddenly catches fire, and a car driver who is refueling heroically puts out the fire, etc. The result is always that the hero is injured and hospitalized.

    After reading these works, I always feel a little uncomfortable. We are building socialism in a peaceful environment, which is normal production. Our Party has always attached great importance to and cared about the safety of workers. For accidents, everything is about prevention. If a furnace cannot smelt steel, we will wait until it is repaired before smelting. Boiler rooms have regular maintenance, and the quality of projects must be strictly checked and accepted. Smoking is strictly prohibited around gasoline depots... In short, we do everything possible to reduce and eliminate accidents. This also fully demonstrates the superiority of our socialist system.

    Of course, accidents are not completely extinct, otherwise, there would be no true heroes such as Qiu Cai Kang and Xiang Xiuli. However, in literary works, if they are written about in great detail, it seems that accidents are rampant, which cannot but make one consider its "authenticity."

    "Expressing characters in severe moments" is an expression technique in literary creation, but the "severe moments" on the industrial front are not necessarily when accidents occur.

### 谈作品中的“事故”

    谈作品中的“事故”
    陕西西安国棉四厂  杨大发
    我是一个工人，喜爱文学，特别喜爱描写工业战线的作品。随着生产大跃进，写工业题材的作品越来越多了。这些作品，歌颂了生产大跃进，歌颂了生产战线上的英雄，起着鼓舞、激励人心和推动大跃进的作用。
    读得多了，我觉得有一个问题，需要提出来和作家们商榷。那就是：“在生产中发生事故”，往往成为有些作品中的重要情节，以此来突出人物，表现人物。比如：
    写钢铁厂的，常常突然发生了事故，一时烟雾弥漫，火花冲天，整个高炉和车间顷刻要化为乌有。这时候，作者笔下的英雄出场了，他奋不顾身地扑入滚滚热流，挽救了车间或高炉，他自己却被烧伤。有的则是正在炼钢或炼铁，突然炉子坏了，本来要冷却以后才能修理，而作者的英雄人物为了争分夺秒多炼钢，就钻进五六百度高温的炉腹之中，修好了炉子。或者就是汽油仓库突然发生了火灾，正在上油的一位汽车司机，如何英勇地扑灭了火灾等。结果都是英雄负伤，住了医院。
    读过这些作品之后，总是感到有点不舒服。我们是在和平环境里建设社会主义，是正常性的生产。我们的党，从来就非常重视和关心工人的安全，对于事故，一切是防患于未然，一个炉不能炼钢了，就会等修理好了再炼，锅炉房有定期检修，工程质量要严格验收，汽油库的周围，一定会严禁烟火……；总之，尽一切力量来减少和消灭事故。这也充分表明我们社会主义制度的优越性。
    当然，事故并不是完全绝迹的，不然，就没有丘财康、向秀丽等真正的英雄。但是，在文学作品中，如果大写特写，看起来几乎是事故横行，这就不能不考虑到它的“真实性”了。
    “在严峻的时刻来表现人物”，是文学创作中的一个表现手法，而工业战线上的“严峻时刻”，却不一定是发生事故的时候。
