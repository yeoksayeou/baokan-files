Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 22nd. The National Ventilation and Dust Control Conference was recently held in Changsha. The conference was hosted by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. Representatives from metallurgical bureaus of various provinces and cities, key metallurgical enterprises, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and institutions of higher learning and scientific research departments attended.

The conference believes that, in the past year, under the leadership and care of the Party, all factories and mines have strengthened publicity and education on dust prevention; paid attention to ventilation and dust extraction, wet drilling, spraying water, humidifying operations, and sealing dust sources; and strengthened personal protection, dust measurement, and employee physical examinations. In the medical treatment of silicosis, the principles of integrating traditional Chinese and Western medicine, combining drug treatment with political and ideological education, integrating medical treatment with light physical labor, regularizing treatment and life, and combining treatment with tuberculosis prevention have been implemented. Great achievements have been made in ventilation, dust prevention, and silicosis treatment. The silica dust content in the air of many factories and mines has been reduced, and silicosis patients who have received treatment have gradually recovered their health and working ability. The conference requires all enterprises to continue to vigorously implement these measures to further reduce dust concentration and improve the health of workers.

The conference exchanged experiences in ventilation and dust prevention in metal mines, concentrators, refractory material plants, foundries, and sintering plants, as well as in the treatment of silicosis. It also organized representatives to visit on-site demonstrations of several ventilation and dust prevention methods. Representatives from the Hunan Xikuangshan Mining Bureau introduced their experience in carrying out mass technical innovation movements, manufacturing more than 30 pieces of equipment such as automatic water curtains, automatic sprinklers, and automatic spray nozzles for funnels, reducing the silica dust concentration to below two milligrams. Representatives from many hospitals and medical research departments exchanged experiences in the treatment of silicosis at the meeting. Representatives from institutions of higher learning and scientific research departments introduced new technologies such as foam dust collectors, dry dust collection, photoelectric dust measurement, remote carbon monoxide measurement, ventilation network analog computers, and semi-micro gravimetric dust measurement, pointing out directions for further development in the future.

　　Every workplace in the Tianbaoshan Copper and Aluminum Mine has water pipe sprinklers. Before drilling, water is sprayed first to turn the dust into slurry. The mineral dust content in each cubic meter of air in this tunnel is only 0.58 milligrams, and workers will not get silicosis even if they do not wear masks.

    进一步做好通风防尘工作
    冶金部等单位联合召开通风防尘会议
    据新华社长沙22日电　全国通风防尘会议最近在长沙市举行。会议是由冶金工业部主持的。出席的有各省市冶金局、重点冶金企业、卫生部、煤炭工业部和高等院校、科学研究部门的代表。
    会议认为，一年来在党的领导和关怀下，各厂矿加强了有关防尘的宣传教育工作；注意了通风抽尘，湿式凿岩，喷雾洒水，加湿作业，密闭尘源；加强了个人防护，测尘和职工身体检查等。在矽肺病的医疗方面，做到了中西医、医药治疗和政治思想教育、医疗与轻体力劳动、治疗与生活规律化、治疗与防痨相结合，在通风防尘和矽肺病治疗工作中取得了很大成绩。许多厂矿空气中矽尘含量都有减少，经过治疗的矽肺病患者，健康和劳动能力逐步恢复。会议要求各个企业继续大力执行这些措施，进一步降低粉尘浓度，增进工人身体健康。
    会议交流了金属矿山、选矿厂、耐火材料厂、铸造厂、烧结厂通风防尘和治疗矽肺病的经验，并组织代表参观了几种通风防尘方法的现场表演。湖南锡矿山矿务局代表在会上介绍了开展群众性技术革新运动，制造自动水幕、自动洒水器、漏斗自动喷雾口等三十多项设备，将矽尘浓度降到二毫克以下的经验。很多医院、医学研究部门的代表在会上交流了治疗矽肺病经验。高等院校、科学研究部门的代表介绍了泡沫除尘器、干式捕尘、光电测尘、遥测一氧化碳、通风网路模拟计算器、半微量计重测尘等新技术，给今后进一步开展工作指出了门路。（附图片）
    天宝山铜铝矿井下各个工作场所，都设有水管喷头。在凿岩前先用水喷洒，使粉尘变成泥浆。这个坑道每一立方米空气的矿尘含量只有零点五八毫克，作业工人不戴口罩也不会得矽肺病了。
