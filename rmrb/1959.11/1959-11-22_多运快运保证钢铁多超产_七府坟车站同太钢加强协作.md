More Transport and Faster Transport Ensure Greater Steel Overproduction
Qifenchen Station and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Strengthen Collaboration
(Our Dispatch) Qifenchen Station of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company are holding high the red flag of road-factory collaboration, continuously improving transportation efficiency. In September, they transported 1,868 tons more materials than in August, and in October, they transported 6,818 tons more than in September. Stoppage time in September was shortened by 6.7 hours compared to August, and in October, it was shortened by another 1.4 hours compared to September.

99% of the materials transported by Qifenchen Station come from Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company. From May to August this year, due to some leading cadres developing right-leaning, slackening sentiments, fewer collaboration meetings were held between the factory and the station, and the old problems of mutual complaints and buck-passing reappeared, leading to a sharp decline in transportation efficiency. Vehicle stoppage time at the station in June was 2.1 hours longer than in May, in July it was 1.2 hours longer than in June, and in August it was 2.5 hours longer than in July. After the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Transportation Department Party Committee held an emergency meeting to educate cadres and all employees, criticizing the right-leaning conservative ideas of a few cadres. Leading cadres actively improved their leadership style, clarified the division of labor, and strengthened leadership over transportation work. The spirit of road-factory collaboration was greatly promoted again.

The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Transportation Department and Qifenchen Station seized the opportunity to vigorously promote "Red Flag Trains," combining Red Flag Trains with the handling of scattered vehicles, concentrating efforts to break through transportation bottlenecks, and vigorously reducing station stoppage time. Loading and unloading workers proposed, "Rather have people wait for the train than have the train wait for people." When the train was still at the station, loading and unloading workers were already waiting at the cargo location. The shunting group also quickly picked up and delivered, and helped to rush unloading. From September 1st to early October, a total of 277 Red Flag Trains were dispatched, comprising 3,361 vehicles, which played a significant role in shortening vehicle dwell time. The twenty-one Red Flag Trains dispatched from September 3rd to 8th had an average dwell time in the factory of 3.6 hours per day, which was 3.9 hours shorter than the planned 7.5 hours, and 4.5 hours shorter than the average dwell time in the factory of 8.1 hours in September.

Qifenchen Station and the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Transportation Department also seized the opportunity to vigorously promote rivalry competitions and chain competitions to ensure more over-transportation and earlier over-transportation, transporting as much as was produced, and overcoming weak links. In the rivalry and chain competitions, the workers of the second shift at Qifenchen Station learned from the experience of the first and third shifts, reversing the long-standing situation of failing to complete tasks.

The strengthening of road-factory collaboration also promoted the strengthening of collaboration among various departments within the enterprise. The mutual collaboration between the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Transportation Department and various production units within the factory has developed. The Director of the Transportation Department visits the production units once a week, and the stationmasters and loading and unloading captains of the three stations under the Transportation Department insist on attending the weekend meetings of the production units they are responsible for, listening to opinions, understanding needs, and improving transportation work. For example, based on the reflection from open-hearth furnace workers that the time for tamping and loading pig iron into the furnace was too long, they proactively studied and improved the transportation operations, allowing the locomotive to operate twice more, changing the original delivery to the front line (outside the factory) to direct delivery to the third line (in front of the furnace inside the factory). This single improvement saved fifteen laborers for each furnace of steel and shortened the loading and unloading time of each furnace of steel by 1 hour and 20 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes, allowing for the production of more than 500 tons of steel per month.

    多运快运保证钢铁多超产
    七府坟车站同太钢加强协作
    本报讯　太原铁路局七府坟车站和太原钢铁公司高举路厂协作的红旗，不断地提高运输效率，9月份比8月多运了一千八百六十八吨物资，10月又比9月多运了六千八百一十八吨；停车时间9月比8月缩短了六点七小时，10月比9月又缩短了一点四小时。
    七府坟车站运输的物资，99％来自太原钢铁公司。今年5月到8月间，由于部分领导干部滋长了右倾松劲情绪，厂和站的协作会议开得少了，互相埋怨、互相推诿的老毛病又出现了，运输效率急骤下降。6月份的车辆停站时间比5月份延长了二点一小时，7月份又比6月份延长了一点二小时，8月份比7月份延长了二点五小时。党的八届八中全会决议公布以后，太钢运输部党委召开了紧急会议，在干部和全体职工中进行教育，批判了少数干部的右倾保守思想。领导干部积极改进领导作风，明确分工，加强了对运输工作的领导。路厂协作之风又大大发扬起来。
    太钢运输部和七府坟车站抓住大搞红旗列车，把红旗列车和处理零散车相结合，集中力量突破运输关键，大力压缩车站停车时间。装卸工人们提出：“宁让人等车，不让车等人”，列车还在车站，装卸工就在货位等候了。调车组也快取快送，并且帮助抢卸车。从9月1日到10月上旬，共开出红旗列车二百七十七列，三千三百六十一辆，对缩短车辆停留时间起了很大作用。9月3日到8日开出的二十一列红旗列车，在厂停留时间，平均每天压缩到三点六小时，比计划七点五小时缩短了三点九小时，比9月份的平均停厂时间八点一小时缩短了四点五小时。
    七府坟车站和太钢运输部还抓住大搞对手赛、连环赛，保证多超运早超运，生产多少，运输多少，克服了薄弱环节。七府坟车站第二班的工人在对手赛、连环赛中，学习一、三班的经验，扭转了长期以来完不成任务的局面。
    路厂协作的加强，也促使企业内部各部门加强了协作。太钢运输部和厂内各生产单位的相互协作有了发展。运输部主任每周到生产单位进行一次访问，运输部所属的三个站的站长和装卸队长，都坚持参加自己所承担的生产单位的周末会议，听取意见，了解需要，改进运输工作。例如，他们根据平炉职工反映的生铁捣扳装炉时间太长的问题，主动研究改进了运输作业，使机车多作业两次，将原来送到一线（厂外）改为直线送到三线（厂内炉前）。仅这一项改进，就使每一炉钢可以节省十五个劳力，并使每炉钢的装卸时间缩短了一点二十分至一点三十分钟，每月可以多产钢五百多吨。
