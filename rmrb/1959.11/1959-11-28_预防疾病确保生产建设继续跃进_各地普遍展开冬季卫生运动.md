Xinhua News Agency, 27th: In order to ensure the continued leap forward in production and construction, winter sanitation campaigns centered on disease prevention are being universally unfolded across the country.

　　This year, various regions have started earlier than in previous years in grasping the work of preventing winter infectious diseases and common diseases. Since mid-September, provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have successively made arrangements for disease prevention work for this winter and next spring, and have actively prepared the necessary medicines, vaccines, serums, and equipment for prevention and treatment. The patriotic health campaign in many regions this winter and next spring is centered on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases such as influenza, measles, and diphtheria. In factories, mines, enterprises, and construction sites, sanitation campaigns have also been launched centering on preventing cold, preventing poisoning, preventing disease, and preventing injuries.

　　Hebei Province is currently conducting physical examinations for five million migrant workers at water conservancy construction sites, summarizing and promoting experience in disease prevention at water conservancy construction sites, to control the occurrence and prevalence of winter infectious and common diseases. Tianjin is focusing on water conservancy construction sites and factories and enterprises to carry out winter pest elimination work centered on disease prevention. Currently, various districts in the city are universally investigating children susceptible to measles and clarifying the incidence patterns of winter diseases, and are imparting knowledge on the prevention and treatment of winter infectious and common diseases to 500,000 Red Cross health workers, who will then publicize it to the masses. Henan Province is vigorously strengthening collective sanitation work in public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens. Hunan has organized more than 37,000 Chinese and Western medical personnel and primary health workers to go to construction sites with migrant workers engaged in water conservancy construction, to carry out the prevention and treatment of winter diseases.

　　With the development and consolidation of the people's communes, rural health organizations are constantly developing and improving. The Party organizations of many communes are focusing on both production and life, strengthening leadership in disease prevention, and providing extremely favorable conditions for the prevention of winter infectious diseases. Many regions have established a set of epidemic reporting organizations and reporting systems adapted to the production organization of the people's communes. For example, Fengqiu County, Henan Province, uses the stewards of the people's commune public canteens as grassroots volunteer reporters, and has established a five-level epidemic reporting system for commune canteens, brigades, central groups, communes, and counties. It has also adopted comprehensive preventive measures among the masses to achieve "early prevention, early detection, early reporting, early treatment, and early isolation," effectively controlling the occurrence of infectious diseases. Another example is the Yanglousi People's Commune in Linxiang County, Hunan Province, which has established a four-level epidemic reporting network for canteens, production teams, brigades, and communes, stipulated a sound reporting system, and vigorously carried out publicity activities. Recently, when the climate suddenly turned cold and diseases were prone to occur, not a single person in the entire commune fell ill.

　　Many regions have also paid attention to giving full play to the role of grassroots health organizations in disease prevention work. Beijing has promoted the "three-way combination" of cadres, medical personnel, and the masses under the leadership of the Party to strengthen disease prevention work in grassroots areas. Now, many medical personnel in Beijing have adopted the method of assigning areas of responsibility to conduct winter disease prevention knowledge training for health activists in the area, and promote grassroots disease prevention work through them. Shanghai has organized a series of experience exchange meetings to cooperate with disease prevention work. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and the Municipal Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine have also recently jointly compiled a handbook on the prevention and treatment of "six diseases" (influenza, measles, pertussis, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, diphtheria, dysentery) with traditional Chinese medicine, for reference by grassroots health units.

    预防疾病确保生产建设继续跃进
    各地普遍展开冬季卫生运动
    新华社27日讯　为确保生产建设继续跃进，全国各地普遍展开以防病为中心的冬季卫生运动。
    今年，各地对预防冬季传染病和多发病的工作比往年抓得早。从9月中旬以后，各省、市、自治区就先后对今冬明春的防病工作进行了部署，并积极对防治所需的药品、疫苗、血清和器材作了准备。许多地区今冬明春季爱国卫生运动，都以防治流感、麻疹、白喉等传染病为中心内容。在厂矿、企业和工地，也都以防寒、防毒、防病、防伤为中心，开展了卫生运动。
    河北省目前正在为水利工地五百万民工作体格检查，总结和推广水利工地防病经验，以控制冬季传染病、多发病的发生与流行。天津市以水利工地和工厂企业为重点，开展了以防病为中心的冬季除害灭病工作。目前，全市各区正在普遍调查麻疹易感儿童和摸清冬季疾病的发病规律，并给五十万红十字卫生员传授防治冬季传染病、多发病的知识，通过他们向广大群众宣传。河南省正在大力加强公共食堂、托儿所和幼儿园等集体卫生工作。湖南各地已组织了三万七千多名中西医务人员和初级卫生人员，随着兴修水利的民工到工地，开展防治冬季疾病工作。
    随着人民公社的发展和巩固，农村卫生组织不断发展和健全，许多公社的党组织一面抓生产，一面抓生活，加强了预防疾病的领导，为预防冬季传染病提供了极为有利的条件。许多地区已建立了一套与人民公社的生产组织相适应的疫情报告组织和报告制度。如河南封丘县以人民公社公共食堂的事务长为基层义务报告员，建立了公社食堂、大队、中心组、公社、县的五级疫情报告制度，并在群众中采取了综合性预防措施，做到“早预防、早发现、早报告、早治疗、早隔离”，有效地控制了传染病的发生。又如湖南临湘县羊楼司人民公社，建立了食堂、生产队、大队、公社的四级疫情报告网，规定了健全的报告制度，大搞宣传活动，在最近气候骤寒、容易发病的情况下，全社没有一个人发病。
    许多地区在防病工作中还注意了充分发挥基层卫生组织的作用。北京市推广了在党的领导下，干部、医务人员和群众“三结合”的防病办法，加强了基层地段的防病工作。现在，北京市的许多医务人员采取了分片包干的办法，深入到地段内对卫生积极分子进行冬季防病知识的训练，通过他们推动基层防病工作。上海市为配合防病工作，已连续组织了一系列的经验交流会。上海市卫生局和市中医学会，最近还合编了中医中药防治“六病”（流感、麻疹、百日咳、流行性脑脊髓膜炎、白喉、痢疾）手册，供基层卫生单位参考。
