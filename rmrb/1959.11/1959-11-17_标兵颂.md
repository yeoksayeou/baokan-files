    Ode to the Vanguard
    Huaibei Radio Equipment Factory Gao Peng
    The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party is a magnificent and resounding bugle call to march, arousing the soaring enthusiasm of 650 million people. Now, the workers on the industrial front are racing against time and fighting decisively in the fourth quarter, heroically fighting to step into 1960 ahead of schedule and overfulfill the main targets of the 1959 national plan and the Second Five-Year Plan. In the booming socialist competition of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced," vanguards are emerging like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Daily vanguards, ten-day vanguards, monthly vanguards...; quality vanguards, innovation vanguards, safety vanguards...; vanguard individuals, vanguard groups, vanguard workshops, vanguard factories and mines...; they are visible everywhere, everywhere. Vanguards, like hundreds of flowers in spring, bloom on the vast land of the motherland, charming and vying for beauty.
    The vanguard is a bright red flag, inspiring the enthusiasm of the masses and setting an example of being both red and expert!
    The vanguard is the arrow of more, faster, better, and more economical, marking the milestones of socialism and piercing the hearts of right-leaning opportunists!
    The vanguard is the hero of the new era, the pioneer of the Great Leap Forward, holding high the banner of the General Line, whipping the horse, riding the wind and waves, and fighting on the forefront of construction!
    The vanguard is the innovator and master of reform, the vanguard in opposing right-leaning tendencies, daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, wielding the broadsword and hacking through thorns and thistles, creating a new life and the future!
    Who says construction started too early? Please look at our vanguards who are ahead of time! Who says construction has been done badly? Please look at our vanguards who create miracles! Who says the products of the Great Leap Forward are not good? Please look at our quality vanguards! Who says it is difficult to improve production efficiency? Please look at our innovation vanguards! Who says we can't do this or that? Right-leaning opportunists, American rumor-mongering experts, please open your mouths and ask the heroes gathered in the Great Hall of the People! Please open your eyes and see the thousands upon thousands of heroes all over the country—the vanguards!...
    The vanguard is the red flag of socialist competition!
    The vanguard is the sharp sword thrown at right-leaning opportunism!
    “Vigorously conduct appraisal and comparison, vigorously establish vanguards, the backward catch up with the advanced, and the advanced become even more advanced” is the central link to mobilize the masses and mobilize all positive factors. A true Marxist-Leninist and a conscious revolutionary fighter should always be a vanguard of continuous revolution. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant light of the General Line, let us sing the Vanguard March and set off a more massive and magnificent wave of socialist competition on all fronts! Let us shout: Long live the vanguard! Long live the red flag competition!

    标兵颂
    华北无线电器材厂　高鹏
    党的八届八中全会的决议，是一支雄壮嘹亮的进军号，激起了六亿五千万人民的冲天干劲。现在，工业战线上的职工，正在争分夺秒，决战第四季度，为提前跨进1960年，超额完成1959年国家计划和第二个五年计划的主要指标英勇地战斗着。在轰轰烈烈的“比先进，学先进、赶先进”的社会主义竞赛中，标兵，像雨后春笋般地涌现出来。日标兵，旬标兵，月标兵……；质量标兵，革新标兵，安全标兵……；标兵个人，标兵小组，标兵车间，标兵厂矿……；仰俯可见，比比皆是。标兵，像春天的百花一样，开放在祖国辽阔的土地之上，妩媚多姿，争妍斗丽。
    标兵，是一面鲜艳的红旗，激励着群众的干劲，树立着红专的榜样！
    标兵，是多快好省的箭头，标示着社会主义的里程，刺向右倾机会主义分子的心脏！
    标兵，是新时代的英雄，大跃进的急先锋，高举着总路线的旗帜，快马加鞭，乘风破浪，战斗在建设的最前列！
    标兵，是革新的能手，反右倾的闯将，敢想，敢说，敢干，大刀阔斧，披荆斩棘，创造着新生和未来！
    谁说建设搞早了？请看我们走在时间前面的标兵！谁说建设搞糟了？请看我们创造奇迹的标兵！谁说大跃进的产品不好？请看我们的质量标兵！谁说生产效率难提高？请看我们的革新标兵！谁说我们这也不行，那也不行？右倾机会主义分子们，美国的造谣专家们，请你们张开口问一问聚集在大会堂的群英！请你们睁开眼看一看千千万万、遍布全国的顶天立地的英雄——标兵！……
    标兵，是社会主义竞赛的红旗！
    标兵，是掷向右倾机会主义的利剑！
    “大搞评比，大树标兵，落后赶先进，先进更先进”是发动群众，调动一切积极因素的中心环节。一个真正的马列主义者，自觉的革命战士，应当永远是一个不断革命的标兵。在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，让我们高唱起标兵进行曲，在各个战线上掀起声势更浩大、规模更壮阔的社会主义竞赛的浪潮！让我们高呼：标兵万岁！红旗竞赛万岁！
