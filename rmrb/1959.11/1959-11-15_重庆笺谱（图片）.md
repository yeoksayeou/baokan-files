    Chongqing Stationery
    In recent years, Chinese printmakers have worked hard to study tradition and have achieved great success. Many woodcuts are rich in national characteristics. The woodcut artists of Chongqing have recently created a set of Chongqing stationery, using the traditional woodblock watermark form, but the content is no longer of the "Solitary Fishing in the Cold River" type. The pictures depict the beautiful lives of the working people. It is hoped that more such works will appear and be promoted to society so that people can really use them to write letters.

    重庆笺谱
    我国的版画家几年来努力学习传统，成就很大，许多木刻富有民族特色。重庆的木刻家们最近创作了一套重庆笺谱，利用传统木版水印的形式，但是已经不是寒江独钓一类内容了，画面上是劳动人民的美好生活。希望这样的作品多多出现，并且把它推广到社会上去，使人们真正能用它来写信。
