Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa Electric Dispatch. Lhasa's dozens of handicraft industries are thriving under the assistance and support of the government. Many industries have established new relationships of mutual support and supply with rural and pastoral areas. The vast majority of handicraft workers in the city's construction industries, such as carpentry, stonework, masonry, and painting, are now working on various construction sites in the Lhasa area. They have fixed monthly wages, stable lives, and their ideological awareness and technical level are constantly improving. In addition to those working on construction sites, more than sixty ironware handicraft households in the city have organized themselves to work together. Some ironware production groups are stepping up the production of ploughshares and other farm tools needed for winter cultivation in rural areas. Starting this autumn, ironworkers began producing large quantities of agricultural tools for nearby rural areas. The Pioneer Farm Tool Production and Processing Store even sent people to the countryside three times to sell their products, which were very popular among farmers and herdsmen. The production of various industries such as sewing, shoemaking, and papermaking has also rapidly recovered and developed. Sewing workers have also made a large number of ready-made garments for sale in the countryside. Several shoemaking production groups in Lhasa are now producing not only leather boots and Tibetan boots, but also various kinds of low-cut, thin-soled casual shoes to meet the needs of urban and rural people.
Lhasa is the city with the most concentrated handicraft industry in the Tibet region. While providing relief and arranging employment for citizens, the Municipal Military Control Commission paid attention to helping handicraft workers restore production. The Tibet Branch of the People's Bank of China has successively provided loans to handicraft production mutual aid groups and individual handicraft workers to help them develop production. The Lhasa Municipal Trade Company has also signed contracts with handicraft workers in some industries to purchase and sell their products on their behalf.

    拉萨手工业蒸蒸日上
    新华社拉萨电　拉萨市的几十种手工业在政府帮助扶持下，生产蒸蒸日上。许多行业和农村牧区建立了互相支援、供应的新关系。全市绝大部分木、石、泥水、油漆等建筑行业的手工业工人已在拉萨地区的各个建筑工地上劳动。他们每月有固定的工资，生活安定，思想觉悟和技术水平不断提高。铁业手工业工人除部分在工地劳动外，全市有六十多户组织起来，共同劳动。有些铁器生产组正加紧赶制农村冬耕需要的犁铧等农具。从今年秋天起，铁业工人们就开始为附近农村生产大量农具。先锋农具生产加工店还曾派人三次下乡出售产品，深受农牧民欢迎。缝纫、制鞋、造纸等各种行业生产也都迅速恢复发展。缝纫工人们还制作了大批成衣到乡下去销售。拉萨市的好几个鞋业生产组现在不但生产皮靴和藏靴，而且也制作各式各样的浅帮薄底便鞋，供应城乡人民的需要。
    拉萨是西藏地区手工业最集中的城市。市军管会在对市民进行救济和安置劳动就业的同时，就注意了帮助手工业工人恢复生产。中国人民银行西藏分行先后贷款给手工业生产互助组和个体手工业者，帮助他们发展生产。拉萨市贸易公司也与一些行业的手工业者订立了合同，收购和代销他们的产品。
