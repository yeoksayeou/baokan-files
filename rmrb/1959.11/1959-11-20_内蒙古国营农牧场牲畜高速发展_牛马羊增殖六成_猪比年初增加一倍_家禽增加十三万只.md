Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 19th: The seventy state-owned farms scattered throughout the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have seen an all-round bumper harvest of cattle, horses, and sheep this year. Hog and poultry production has also developed rapidly.

In the past year, the state-owned farms in Inner Mongolia have conscientiously implemented the autonomous region's Party committee's policy of comprehensively, steadily, and rapidly developing animal husbandry production, and have strengthened the organizational leadership and management of animal husbandry production in all aspects. After day and night of hard work and skillful efforts by people of all ethnic groups, a great harvest of animal husbandry has finally been achieved. Currently, the total number of the three main livestock of horses, cattle, and sheep on farms throughout the region has increased from more than 214,000 at the beginning of the year to more than 345,000, with a total increase rate as high as 61.1%. Among them, the number of wool sheep increased by 71.8%, cattle by 45.6%, and horses by 30%. This speed is rare in the history of the autonomous region.

While rapidly increasing the number of cattle, horses, and sheep, farms in Inner Mongolia have also implemented the policy of diversified operations this year, vigorously developing pig and chicken farming and establishing small-scale industries. Now, the total number of pigs has doubled compared to the beginning of the year, reaching more than 23,000; the number of poultry has also increased from more than 9,000 at the beginning of the year to more than 140,000. The agricultural and pastoral machinery repair and assembly, grain, oil, and feed processing, leather and fur, and dairy product processing factories attached to the farms number around two hundred. These have played an important role in promoting the continued development of production and increasing national income.

The quality of livestock and the level of business management of state-owned farms in Inner Mongolia have improved significantly over the past year. All ewes on each farm have been crossbred and improved using fine breed rams. Most farms have realized the improvement of their sheep flocks. The staff of each farm are full of energy and vigorously improve feeding management, carefully take care of newborn animals, and strive to improve techniques such as gaining weight, breeding, and preventing animal diseases. As a result, not only has the survival rate of lambs generally reached 95%, an increase of 6.4% compared with last year, and the loss of livestock due to death has been greatly reduced, but also a number of high-yielding livestock groups have emerged. The Aohan Banner Sheep Farm created a record of high-yield and high-yield large flocks of sheep, with a breeding survival rate of 132.2% for 2,500 ewes; the total breeding survival rate of young animals at the Wengniute Banner Baiyinhua Sheep Farm also increased to 109.5%; one hundred Xinjiang fine-wool ewes at the Xilingol Stud Farm bred and survived one hundred and seventy-two lambs this year, and two hundred and fifty cows calved two hundred and fifty-one calves, all of which survived.

    内蒙古国营农牧场牲畜高速发展
    牛马羊增殖六成
    猪比年初增加一倍
    家禽增加十三万只
    新华社呼和浩特19日电　分布在内蒙古自治区各地的七十处国营农牧场，今年牛、马、羊全面丰收。生猪家禽生产也发展很快。
    最近一年来，内蒙古各国营农牧场认真贯彻执行了自治区党委提出全面稳定高速度发展畜牧业生产的方针，从各方面加强了畜牧业生产的组织领导和经营管理。经过各族职工日日夜夜苦战巧干，终于实现了畜牧业大丰收。目前，全区农牧场的马、牛、羊三种主要牲畜，已由年初的二十一万四千多头，跃增到三十四万五千多头，总增殖率高达61.1％。其中绵山羊增殖了71.8％，牛增殖45.6％，马增殖30％。这个速度是自治区历史上罕有的。
    在高速度增殖牛、马、羊的同时，内蒙古各地农牧场今年还贯彻多种经营的方针，大搞养猪、养鸡和兴办小型工业。现在，猪的总数已比年初增加一倍，达到两万三千多口；家禽也由年初的九千多只增加到十四万只以上。各农牧场附设的农牧业机械修配，粮油饲料加工，皮毛、乳品加工等工厂，已有二百个左右。这些，对促进生产继续发展、增加国家收入起了重要作用。
    内蒙古国营农牧场的牲畜质量和经营管理水平，一年来有了显著提高。各场所有母羊，已引用优良种公羊进行了杂交配种改良。大部分农牧场的羊群实现了良种化。各场职工鼓足干劲，大力改进饲养管理，精心接产保育幼畜，努力提高抓膘、配种和畜疫防治等技术，不仅使幼羔成活率一般都达到95％，比去年上升6.4％，牲畜死亡损失现象大为减少，还出现了一批高产畜群。敖汉旗羊场创造大群绵羊高额丰产纪录，二千五百只母绵羊繁殖成活率达132.2％；翁牛特旗白音花羊场仔畜总繁殖成活率也提高到109.5％；锡林郭勒种畜场的一百只新疆细毛母羊，今年繁殖成活了一百七十二只羔羊，并有二百五十头母牛产犊二百五十一头，全部成活。
