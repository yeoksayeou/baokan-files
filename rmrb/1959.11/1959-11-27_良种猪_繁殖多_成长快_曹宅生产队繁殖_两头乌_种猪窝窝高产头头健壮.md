    Good Breed of Pigs, Many Offspring, Fast Growth
    Caozhai Production Team Breeds "Two-End Black" Breeding Pigs with High Yields Per Litter and Every One Robust
    (Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 26th) The Caozhai and Huangcun production teams in Tangya Commune, Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, have roughly the same natural conditions, but in pig farming, one team emphasizes breeding and raising superior pig breeds, while the other does not pay attention to selecting and retaining good breeds. As a result, there are significant differences in the growth rate, fattening speed, and meat quality of the pigs in the two teams.
    Last spring, the Caozhai team bought more than two hundred piglets from other places. Due to poor feeding management and the fact that they were not good breeds, they all died one after another not long after. The leading cadres of the Caozhai team then resolved to breed and raise good breeds of pigs themselves, expanding a breeding pig farm and sending a deputy secretary to serve as the farm's director, specializing in breeding "Two-End Black" superior piglets. At the same time, they also paid attention to selecting and retaining "Two-End Black" sows in the other four livestock farms, gradually eliminating inferior breeds. At present, among the 651 sows raised by the team, 458 are "Two-End Black." "Two-End Black" sows mature early and have a high breeding rate. They can generally conceive and become pregnant after being fed for six months, and their estrus is obvious, making it easy to grasp the breeding time and facilitate the use of advanced methods such as double mating and multiple mating. A "Two-End Black" sow can produce two and a half litters of piglets per year, with each litter generally having twelve or thirteen piglets, and some having as many as twenty-two or twenty-three. "Two-End Black" sows are mild-tempered and take good care of their piglets, with a very high survival rate, generally around 97%. Now, the sows in the Caozhai team's breeding pig farm are all pregnant, with high yields per litter, and the piglets are all robust, earning it the name "Full House Red" breeding pig farm. This team has bred more than 1,800 piglets this year. In addition to meeting the needs of the team's public raising and the feeding of member households, they have also supported other communes with a batch of piglets.
    The Huangcun team not only raises fewer sows, with only 35 sows in the entire team, but also only has four "Two-End Black" superior sows. Hybrid sows mature slowly and have a low breeding rate. They generally have to be raised for more than a year before they can conceive and become pregnant, and they can only produce a maximum of two litters of piglets per year, with each litter generally having only seven or eight piglets, and a survival rate of only about 70%. Due to the difficulty in obtaining piglets, the team currently raises less than one pig per household on average.
    The "Two-End Black" superior pigs raised by the Caozhai team grow faster and have stronger resistance. "Two-End Black" piglets generally weigh more than 20 catties less than two months after birth. If they are well-fed after weaning, most can gain one catty of meat per day. After another month of feeding, they can weigh forty or fifty catties, and after six months, they can weigh more than 120 catties. A "Two-End Black" meat pig raised on a trial basis by this team weighed 364 catties after sixteen months. "Two-End Black" piglets have strong disease resistance and are not prone to diseases such as white diarrhea and asthma. These diseases have not occurred in the Caozhai team for more than half a year. However, the ordinary pigs raised by the Huangcun team not only grow more slowly, but also get sick more often. One or two piglets in each litter suffer from white diarrhea, and there are even more "stunted pigs" - these pigs eat a lot but grow slowly.
    The meat quality of the pigs raised by the Caozhai and Huangcun teams is also different, resulting in varying selling prices and different incomes from pig farming. The "Two-End Black" superior pigs raised by the Caozhai team have thin skin and fine bones, with lean meat and thick fat. The nearly one hundred large fat pigs sold to the state this year were generally rated as Grade A pigs, not only meeting the needs of curing "Jinhua ham" but also obtaining the highest price, with the team's total income reaching more than 10,000 yuan. The Huangcun team only sold ten large fat pigs to the state this year, most of which were not rated as Grade A, with lower prices and relatively less income.
    Recently, in the vigorous development of pig production, Tangya Commune summarized the benefits and experiences of Caozhai team's breeding and raising of superior pigs and promoted them throughout the commune. Under the unified leadership of the commune, the Caozhai team decided to further breed superior pigs, selecting and retaining more than 200 "Two-End Black" sows, and expanding the original breeding pig farm. The Huangcun team also sent cadres to the Caozhai team several times to visit and learn, and saw the benefits of breeding and raising superior pigs, resolving to catch up and vigorously promote the breeding of good breeds. At present, they have selected and retained more than 20 "Two-End Black" sows and established a breeding pig farm, assigning Zhang Qifa, a production team cadre and Communist Party member, to serve as the farm's director. The Party branch also mobilized members to actively engage in feed production and build pig houses, vigorously promoting the selection and breeding of "Two-End Black" sows.
    Furthermore, Jinhua County has started construction of a large-scale breeding pig farm, vigorously cultivating and breeding the famous "Two-End Black" superior pig breed, in order to increase pig production and improve quality.
    This large-scale breeding pig farm is being expanded on the basis of an existing small-scale breeding pig farm and will be able to cultivate more than 1,500 "Two-End Black" breeding pigs by the end of this year. This 10,000-pig breeding farm will be equipped with modern equipment and adopt advanced breeding and management methods, building new-style pig houses, feed warehouses, and feed processing rooms, using grass cutters, rolling machines, crushers, feed steam engines, and electric feeding carts, implementing mechanization of material preparation, automation of feeding, and self-flowing water supply. These works are currently underway.

    良种猪　繁殖多　成长快
    曹宅生产队繁殖“两头乌”种猪窝窝高产头头健壮
    本报杭州26日电　浙江金华县塘雅公社曹宅、黄村两个生产队，自然条件大体相同，但在养猪工作中，一个队重视繁殖和饲养优良猪种，一个队不注意选留良种猪，结果两个队的猪的增长速度、育肥快慢和肉质好坏都相差很大。
    曹宅队去年春天由外地买进两百多头小猪，由于饲养管理不好，加上不是良种猪，没养多久就先后死完。曹宅队的领导干部从此就决心自繁自养良种猪，扩建了一个种猪场，又派了一个副书记去担任场长，专门繁育“两头乌”良种仔猪。同时在其它四个畜牧场里也注意选留“两头乌”母猪，逐步淘汰劣种。目前全队养的六百五十一头母猪中，“两头乌”已有四百五十八头。“两头乌”母猪成熟期早，繁殖率高，一般喂养六个月就能受胎怀孕，而且发情明显，容易掌握配种时间，便于采用双重配、多次配的先进方法。一头“两头乌”母猪，每年能产猪仔两窝半，每窝猪仔一般十二、三只，多的有二十二、三只。“两头乌”母猪性情温和，小猪带得好，成活率很高，一般都在97％左右。现在曹宅队种猪场内的母猪头头满怀，窝窝高产，仔猪只只健壮，被称为“满堂红”种猪场。这个队今年已经繁育了猪仔一千八百多只，除满足本队公养和社员家庭饲养的需要外，还把一批小猪支援了别的公社。
    黄村队不仅母猪养得少，全队只有三十五头母猪，而且“两头乌”良种母猪只有四头。杂种母猪成熟期慢，繁殖率低，一般要饲养一年以后才能受胎怀孕，每年最多产猪仔两窝，每窝一般只有七、八只，而且成活率只有70％左右。由于猪仔来源困难，目前这个队平均每户养猪不到一头。
    曹宅队饲养的“两头乌”良种猪长肉比较快，抵抗力也比较强。“两头乌”小猪一般生下不到两个月就重二十多斤，断奶后如饲养得好，大多一天能长肉一斤，再养一个多月就有四、五十斤，六个月就可重一百二十斤以上。这个队试养的一头“两头乌”肉猪，十六个月重三百六十四斤。“两头乌”仔猪抗病力强，不易得白痢、气喘等病，曹宅队半年多来没有发生过这些病。而黄村队饲养的一般猪不仅长肉较慢，发病也多，每窝小猪都有一、二个害白痢病的，“僵猪”更多——这种猪吃得多，就是长得慢。
    曹宅、黄村两个队饲养的猪，肉质好坏也不一样，因而售猪价格有高有低，养猪收入有多有少。曹宅队养的“两头乌”良种猪，皮薄骨细，肉精脂厚，今年已出售给国家的近百头大肥猪，一般都评为甲等猪，不仅供应了腌制“金华火腿”的需要，而且得到了最高的价格，全队收入达一万多元。黄村队今年售给国家的大肥猪仅有十头，大多评不上甲等，价格较低，收入也相对少些。
    最近塘雅公社在大力发展养猪生产中，总结了曹宅队繁殖饲养良种猪的好处和经验，在全公社推广。曹宅队在公社统一领导下，决定进一步繁殖良种猪，又选留了
  “两头乌”母猪二百多头，原来的种猪场也扩建了。黄村队也几次派干部到曹宅队参观学习，看到了繁殖和饲养良种猪的好处，决心迎头赶上，大抓良种繁育工作。目前已选留了“两头乌”母猪二十多头，并且建立了种猪场，调派了生产队干部、共产党员张启发去担任场长。党支部还发动社员积极搞饲料，建猪舍，大抓“两头乌”母猪的选留和饲养工作。
    又讯　金华县动工兴建大型种猪场，大力培育和繁殖著名的“两头乌”优良种猪，以增加猪的产量和提高质量。
    这个大型种猪场是在原有一个小规模的种猪场基础上扩建的，今年年底就可培育“两头乌”种猪一千五百头以上。这个万头种猪场将装设现代化设备和采取先进的培育管理方法，建造新式的猪舍、饲料仓库、饲料加工室，使用切草机、轧并机、粉碎机、饲料蒸汽机、电动送料车，实行备料机械化，送料自动化，饮水自流化，目前这些工作正在进行中。
