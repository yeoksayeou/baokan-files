    Not Letting a Comrade Fall Behind
    Zeng Tianjia
    Those who have served in the military have had this experience: whenever there is a long march under the blazing sun or in the hazy night, some comrades who are physically weaker often cannot keep up with the team. At this time, a moving scene will appear, comrades (including leaders) will rush to carry their backpacks and guns for them; when they cannot walk, they will support or carry them. Everyone has a common wish: to successfully complete the marching and combat missions, and not let a comrade fall behind. This deep class friendship is truly touching.
    Today, we are engaged in great socialist construction, and this valuable spirit has appeared in different forms on the production front.
    The Conference of Heroes is now over, but the communist spirit of selfless and enthusiastic assistance to comrades displayed by the representatives is unforgettable. Its influence is gradually expanding, blossoming and bearing fruit throughout the country, profoundly educating the broad masses of workers. According to reports, the youth of the Shanghai Tool Factory shouted the slogan "In the high-speed march into 1960, do not let a comrade fall behind." Young workers who are ahead of schedule are using various methods to help their comrades catch up. As a result, two-thirds of the young workers with quotas have already completed their annual workload ahead of schedule.
      "Not letting a comrade fall behind!" Two marches, one slogan, one spirit. The former is a real march, not letting a comrade fall behind is to better complete the combat mission; the latter is a march on the production front—a march on the production front, not letting a comrade fall behind, is to move forward together, to complete the national plan faster and better, and to build socialism faster and better. But the spirit is the same—the spirit of communism, the spirit of selflessness!
    Is the emergence of this new spirit and new atmosphere accidental? No! It is the result of the Party's education and training, and it is a manifestation of the improvement of people's political and ideological awareness. People live not only for themselves, but for everyone, for the happiness of future generations. To make everyone's life better, we must strive to change our country's poor and blank state and build socialism and communism. This arduous and great cause is the cause of the whole people, and it cannot be done well by one person or a few people alone. "Many hands make light work." People fully understand this, so when they have inventions and creations, they do not treat them as private property, keep them secret, but treat them as the property of the whole people and make them public, wishing others to learn this skill as well, with the aim of working together to better build the motherland. This is also because these advanced people understand that all their achievements, all their inventions and creations, including their own advanced ideas, come from the collective, from the great class and the great Party. They have not attributed all of these to their personal accounts. Therefore, when they see that others are lagging behind in production, or when they see comrades lagging behind them, they never adopt an attitude of cold ridicule, but believe that this is a loss to the collective, and they should enthusiastically help them, improve them, and increase a share of strength for national construction. "Not letting a comrade fall behind!" specifically embodies their spirit.
    Not letting a comrade fall behind! Not letting a group fall behind! Not letting a workshop fall behind! Not letting a brother enterprise fall behind... The flowers of communist cooperation are blooming all over the motherland. "Competition is an opponent, cooperation is a brother." This loud slogan put forward by the working comrades is already echoing in the hearts of more people. Hundreds of millions of socialist builders are helping each other, encouraging each other, and marching hand in hand, holding high the red flags of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, towards a common and great goal!

    不让一个伙伴掉队
    曾田家
    行过军的人都有过这种感受：每当在烈日当空或者夜色朦胧的晚上长途行军，有些身体较弱的同志，往往不能支持，跟不上队伍。这时就会出现一幅动人的景象，同志们（包括领导同志在内）就抢着给他们背背包，背枪；当他们走不动的时候，就搀扶着或背着他们走。大家有一个共同的愿望：要胜利完成行军和战斗任务，不让一个伙伴掉队。这种深厚的阶级友爱，真使人感动万分。
    而今我们正在进行伟大的社会主义建设，这种可贵的精神又以不同的形式出现在生产战线上。
    群英会现在已经闭幕了，而代表们那种大公无私热诚帮助同志的共产主义精神，却使人久久不忘，它的影响正在全国逐步扩大，开花结果，使广大工人群众受到了深刻的教育。报载，上海工具厂青年喊出了“在高速度跨进1960年的急行军中，不让一个伙伴掉队”的口号。跑在时间前面的青年工人用各种方法帮助同伴赶上自己。结果，现在已经有三分之二有定额的青年工人提前完成了全年工作量。
      “不让一个伙伴掉队！”两种行军，一个口号，一种精神。前者是真正的行军，不让一个同伴掉队是为了很好地完成战斗任务；后者是生产战线的行军——生产战线的行军，不让一个伙伴掉队，是为了共同前进，更快更好地完成国家计划，更快更好地建设社会主义。而精神却是一个——共产主义的精神，大公无私的精神！
    这种新的精神、新的气象的出现是偶然的么？不！它是党的教育培养的结果，它是人们政治、思想觉悟提高的表现。人活着，不单是为了自己，而是为了大家，为了子孙万代的幸福。要使大家的生活过得更美好，就要努力改变我们国家一穷二白的面貌，建设社会主义和共产主义。而这一艰巨伟大的事业，是全民的事业，单靠一个人或者少数人去做是做不好的。“众人拾柴火焰高”，人们正是充分认识到了这点，因此，当他们有所发明和创造的时候，并不把它当作私有财产，秘而不宣，而是把它当作全民的财产公诸于世，愿别人也学到这套本事，目的无非是齐心合力更好地建设祖国。这也还因为这些先进者明白：他们的一切成就，一切创造发明，包括他们自己的先进思想在内，都是来之于集体，来之于伟大的阶级和伟大的党。他们并没有把这些都算到个人的账上。因而，当他们看到别人生产落后的时候，或者看到自己身边有掉队的伙伴的时候，他们从来不是采取冷眼嘲笑的态度，而是认为这是集体的一种损失，应该热心帮助他们，提高他们，为国家建设增加一分力量。“不让一个同伴掉队！”正具体体现了他们的这一精神面貌。
    不让一个伙伴掉队！不让一个小组掉队！不让一个车间掉队！不让一个兄弟企业掉队……共产主义协作之花，正在祖国各地开放。“竞赛是对手，协作是兄弟。”这一个由工人同志提出的响亮口号，已经在更多的人们的心里回响，亿万个社会主义建设者们，正互相帮助，互相砥砺，并肩携手，高举着党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，向着共同的伟大的目标前进！
