Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Public opinion in various countries unanimously condemns the Lao authorities' preparation to try Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, and firmly demands that the Lao government stop this act of blatant violation of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements.

The Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" published an article on October 25, stating that the Lao government's persecution of democratic forces has aroused deep indignation among all progressive humanity. It said that the Lao government's brutal violation of the Vientiane Agreements and the Geneva Accords, its persecution of democratic forces, its attacks on the former Lao combat forces, and its arrest of leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front were all carried out with the connivance of the American aggressive bloc.

The article said that world public opinion believes that in Laos, the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements have been brutally violated, and even the basic principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Charter of the United Nations have been violated. The article pointed out that the arrest of Prince Souphanouvong, a member of the Lao National Assembly, is an intolerable act of betrayal of the parliamentary rights guaranteed by the Lao Constitution.

The article said that no one now doubts that the Sananikone government's persecution of Prince Souphanouvong and his comrades is an attempt to suppress the domestic democratic movement and the people's struggle against turning Laos into a US military base. The trial farce is not a manifestation of the strength of the Lao ruling clique, but of its fragility. It said that this action is directly related to the already bankrupt "investigation" incident conducted by the United Nations "Laos Situation Investigation Subcommittee."

TASS commentator Kharkov wrote in a commentary that the so-called "treason conspiracy" charges fabricated by the Lao government against Souphanouvong and other Lao patriots are a provocative act, the purpose of which is to divert public attention from the real reasons for the current tense situation in Laos and to deepen domestic divisions, ultimately to expand the flames of civil war. This situation will obviously only satisfy those foreign forces who support the Lao Royal Government behind the scenes.

The commentary pointed out that the trial of Lao patriots shows that the Lao Royal Government has reneged on all its past promises to guarantee democratic rights at home. It also shows that the Royal Government and its protectors are deliberately undermining the Geneva Accords.

The Soviet newspapers "Trud" and "Soviet Russia" both published articles on October 27, condemning the Lao authorities' preparation to illegally try Prince Souphanouvong and other patriotic fighters.

The Vietnamese Committee for the Defense of World Peace issued a statement on the 1st, demanding that the Sananikone government revoke the illegal trial of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

The statement reviewed the contributions made by Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front to the struggle for national independence, anti-colonialism, and anti-imperialism. The statement pointed out that if the Sananikone government brazenly tries Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, they will inevitably suffer serious consequences.

The statement said that the Vietnamese people demand the revocation of the trial of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, the restoration of their freedom, the cessation of the civil war in Laos, the cessation of all US imperialist interference in Laos, the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, in order to ease the tense situation in Laos and Indochina, and to safeguard peace in Southeast Asia.

The Vietnamese newspaper "Nhan Dan" published a commentary on October 26, condemning the Lao authorities for announcing the "postponement of the trial" of Prince Souphanouvong and seven other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front without abandoning this illegal "trial." The commentary pointed out that this situation shows that the Lao authorities are continuing to implement a policy of serving US imperialism.

The commentary concluded by saying that the peace and democratic forces of Laos, Asia, Africa, and the world must be vigilant and continue to struggle, demanding that the Phoui Sananikone government completely abandon the conspiracy to illegally try the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, and immediately restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

A statement issued by the Korean Committee for Asian-African Solidarity on October 31, published in Pyongyang newspapers on the 1st, said that the Korean people, together with peace-loving people around the world, resolutely condemn this conspiracy by US imperialism and the Sananikone group, and resolutely advocate the immediate and unconditional release of Prince Souphanouvong and the other eight leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

The Bulgarian National Committee for the Defense of Peace sent a telegram to the United Nations, protesting against the Lao Royal Government's illegal trial of Lao patriots.

The telegram pointed out that the persecution of prominent representatives of Lao patriotic and peace-loving forces is completely contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and is an intolerable violation of Laos' democratic freedoms.

The Polish newspaper "Życie Warszawy" published a commentary on October 29, pointing out that the Lao Royal Government arrested Prince Souphanouvong on the pretext of allegedly committing the crime of "conspiracy to treason." In the eyes of the pro-imperialist Lao government, Prince Souphanouvong's fault is that he is fighting against imperialism, against colonialism, and for independence.

The commentary went on to point out: The trial of Prince Souphanouvong and other patriots is another violation of the Geneva Accords and yet another attempt to oppose the progressive forces in Laos.

    制止非法审讯苏发努冯　不容撕毁日内瓦协议
    苏越等国舆论声讨美萨集团罪行
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：世界各国公众舆论一致谴责老挝当局准备审讯苏发努冯等老挝爱国战线党领导人，并坚决要求制止老挝政府这种粗暴破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议的行为。
    苏联“消息报”10月25日发表文章说，老挝政府对民主力量的迫害已引起了所有进步人类的深深愤慨。它说，老挝政府粗暴地破坏万象协议和日内瓦协议、迫害民主力量、进攻前寮国战斗部队以及逮捕爱国战线党领导人等活动都是在美国侵略集团的纵容下干出来的。
    文章说，全世界公众认为，在老挝，日内瓦协议和万象协议已被粗暴地破坏了，就连人权宣言和联合国宪章的基本原则也被破坏了。文章指出，老挝国民议会议员苏发努冯亲王的逮捕是对老挝宪法保证的议员权利的不可容忍的背信行为。
    文章说，现在没有人怀疑萨纳尼空政府对苏发努冯亲王及其同志的迫害是企图镇压国内的民主运动和镇压人民反对把老挝变为美国的军事基地的斗争。审讯丑剧不是老挝统治集团强大的表现，而是它的脆弱的表现。它说，这一行动不能不同联合国“老挝局势调查小组委员会”所进行的早已破了产的“调查”事件有直接联系。
    塔斯社评论员哈尔科夫在一篇评论中写道，老挝政府给苏发努冯和老挝其他爱国者所捏造的所谓“叛国阴谋”的罪名是一种挑衅行为，其目的在于使公众不去注意老挝目前紧张局势的真正原因和加深国内的分裂，归根结底就是要扩大内战的火焰。这情况显然只会使在幕后支持老挝王国政府的那些外国势力感到十分满意。
    评论指出，对老挝爱国者的审讯表明老挝王国政府一笔勾销了它过去就保障国内民主权利所许下的一切诺言。同时也表明，王国政府及其保护者存心破坏日内瓦协议。
    苏联“劳动报”和“苏维埃俄罗斯报”10月27日都发表文章，谴责老挝当局准备非法审讯苏发努冯等爱国志士。
    越南保卫世界和平委员会1日发表声明，要求萨纳尼空政府撤销对苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的非法审判。
    声明回顾了苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人为民族独立、反殖民主义、反帝国主义斗争所作出的贡献。声明指出，如果萨纳尼空政府悍然审判苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人，他们必定遭到严重的后果。
    声明说，越南人民要求撤销对苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的审判，恢复他们的自由，停止老挝的内战，美帝国主义停止干涉老挝的一切行动，严正履行日内瓦协议和万象协议，以缓和老挝和印度支那紧张局势，维护东南亚的和平。
    越南“人民报” 10月26日发表评论，谴责老挝当局宣布“延期审讯”苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他七位领导人而不肯放弃这种非法“审讯”。评论指出，这种情况表明，老挝当局正在继续执行着为美帝国主义效劳的政策。
    评论最后说，老挝、亚非各国以及全世界的和平民主力量必须提高警惕，继续进行斗争，要求培·萨纳尼空政府完全放弃非法审讯老挝爱国战线党领导人的阴谋，立即恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的自由。
    平壤报纸1日刊登的朝鲜亚非团结委员会在10月31日发表的一项声明说，朝鲜人民同全世界爱好和平的人民一道，坚决谴责美帝国主义和萨纳尼空集团的这一阴谋，并且坚决主张立即无条件地释放苏发努冯亲王等八位老挝爱国战线党领导人。
    保加利亚保卫和平全国委员会打电报给联合国，抗议老挝王国政府将非法审讯老挝爱国人士。
    电报指出，对老挝爱国和爱好和平力量的著名代表的迫害是完全与联合国宪章相违背的，是对老挝的民主自由的不能容忍的破坏。
    波兰“华沙生活报”10月29日发表评论指出，老挝王国政府借口所谓犯有“阴谋叛国”的罪行而逮捕了苏发努冯。在亲帝国主义的老挝政府看来，苏发努冯亲王的罪过就是他为反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义和为争取独立而进行斗争。
    评论接着指出：对苏发努冯亲王和其他爱国者的审判是又一次违反了日内瓦协议，是反对老挝进步力量的又一尝试。
