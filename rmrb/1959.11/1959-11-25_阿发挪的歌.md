    Afa Nuo's Song
    Yi Nationality, Pu Fei
    The Green River flows under the Great Black Mountain. It is Sunday, and the Yi raftmen who cut wood are resting. The river is quiet.
    Suddenly, the green waves shimmer. A Yi youth, with a long pole, steers the timber out from the bend, and his singing floats on the river:
    Green waves, green waves, pave the way quickly,
    My timber must be rafted to the other side,
    Over there, the rising buildings,
    Are waiting for the timber to arrive soon.
    The young man sings, repeatedly sings. When he grows quiet, things from many years ago float before his eyes.
    At that time, he was still a child, and people called him by his name: Afa Nuo. At that time, he often saw a rich man wearing a felt hat nearby, coming to the village with two men carrying guns. The rich man shouted loudly: "Who has nothing to eat, go and raft timber for us! After the timber is rafted, you will get measured rice when you return home!" Afa Nuo's father ate some wild vegetables and went with the men in the village to raft timber for the rich man. He did not return until dark, leaning on a stick. He took off his wet clothes and leaned weakly against the door, saying to his mother: "I am tired, you go and get the rice." His mother took a small basin and went out. When she returned, his father stared at the rice at the bottom of the basin and said, "Alas! All my strength is exhausted, and I only get this little bit!"
    One day, Afa Nuo was extremely hungry, and his parents were also extremely hungry. His father had no choice but to go rafting timber again. His mother said, "Look, you can't even stand steadily, how can you raft timber?" His father said, "Even if I only get half a handful of rice, I still have to go, if I don't go, I won't get even a single grain!" His mother was worried and followed along the riverbank with Afa Nuo on her back. His father paid attention to the reefs in the river, pushing the timber forward. He fell into the river, then climbed back onto the raft, fell down, then climbed back up. The river roared, and ahead was a large whirlpool. Oh dear, father fell down again, and did not climb back up for a long time. Mother put down Afa Nuo and jumped into the whirlpool after him! She also did not climb back up...
    The young man Afa Nuo wiped away his tears and began to sing again. He saw green willows planted on the riverbank, and he saw that there were no more reefs in the river. The raft floated steadily, and he would never fall into the water like his father.
    "Papa, Papa, are you going to sing 'Ya Ya' today? Are you going to play 'ding dong ding dong'?" A child was sitting on the raft, and he raised his head and said this to the young man.
    The young man replied, "We'll sing everything, we'll play everything, Papa will take you to see it again. That big house that sings 'Ya Ya' is built with this timber, and when you grow up you have to raft timber too!"
    The child said, "Papa, I'm rafting timber now!" Suddenly, he exclaimed as if he had discovered something amazing: "Papa, look how long this raft is!"
    This raft was indeed very long. Afa Nuo broke the rules of previous years, jumping from rafting five platforms each time to rafting eight platforms, and today he jumped to rafting thirteen platforms at once. His raft, one platform biting another, dragged a very long, very long tail, looking like a long dragon wagging its head and tail!
    The child also said, "Papa, I don't see anyone today, it's Sunday again, it's Sunday again!"
    The young man imitated the child's tone and said, "It's Sunday, Papa doesn't rest, doesn't rest. Papa wants to quickly raft the timber over there, they are building houses again."
    After the young man finished speaking, he sang his song again:
    Green waves, green waves, pave the way quickly,
    My timber must be rafted to the other side...,

    阿发挪的歌
    彝族  普飞
    绿河水在大黑山下奔流着。是星期天，划木头的彝族筏手们都休息了。河上静悄悄的。
    忽然之间，绿波闪动起来。一个彝族青年撑着长篙，从转弯里把木头划出来了，于是河上飘起了他的歌声：
    绿波绿波快铺路，
    我的木头要划到那边，
    那边一幢幢升起的楼房啊，
    正盼望着木头早些运来。
    青年唱着，反复地唱着。当他静下来时，多年前的事就浮现在他眼前。
    那时他还是个孩子，人们直呼他的名字：阿发挪。那时他常常看见附近有个戴毡帽的财主，带着两个背枪的人到寨子里来。财主大声叫着：“谁没有吃的，给我们划木头去！把木头划到了，回家来就量米给他！”阿发挪的爸爸煮了些野菜吃，就和寨子里的男人们跟财主划木头去了。直到天黑，他才拄着一根棍子回来，他脱下了弄湿了的衣服，有气无力地靠在门板上，对妈妈说：“我累了，米你去拿吧。”妈妈拿了小盆出去了。回来的时候，爸爸盯着盆底的米说：“唉！力气都使尽啦，就只给这点点哇！”
    一天，阿发挪饿极了，爸爸妈妈也饿极了。爸爸不得不又去划木头。妈妈说：“瞧你站也站不住了，还能划木头吗？”爸爸说：“就是只给半捧米我还是得去，不去可一颗也吃不到呢！”妈妈不放心，背着阿发挪在河岸上跟着。爸爸注意着河里的礁石，把木头向前划去。只见他倒下河里去，又爬上木筏来，倒下去，又爬上来。河水哗哗地响着，前边就是个大漩涡。哎呀，爸爸又倒下去了，久久不再爬上来。妈妈放下阿发挪，跟着扑进漩涡去！她也不再爬上来……
    青年阿发挪擦擦眼泪又唱了起来。他看见河岸栽上了绿柳，他看见河中没有了礁石。筏子平稳地游着，他决不会像父亲那样掉下水去了。
    “爸爸，爸爸，今天唱不唱?呀?呀？打不打叮咚叮咚？”筏子上坐着一个小孩子，他抬起头来对青年人这样说。
    青年回答说：“都唱的，都打的，爸爸又要带你去看啦。那间唱?呀?呀的大房屋，就是用这些木头盖起来的，你长大了可也要划木头呀！”
    孩子说：“爸爸，我现在就划木头啦。”突然他惊叫起来像发现了什么奇事：“爸爸，你看这筏子多长啊！”
    这筏子确是很长的。阿发挪打破了历年来的规矩，由每次划五床跃到划八床，今天又跃到一次划十三床了。他的筏子啊，一床咬着一床，拖了一条很长很长的尾巴，活像一条摇头摆尾的长龙！
    孩子又说道：“爸爸，今天不见人，又是星期天，又是星期天！”
    青年学着孩子的口吻说：“是星期天，爸爸不休息，不休息。爸爸要快些把木头划去哟，那边又盖房屋啦。”
    青年说罢，又唱着他的歌：
    绿波绿波快铺路，
    我的木头要划到那边……，
