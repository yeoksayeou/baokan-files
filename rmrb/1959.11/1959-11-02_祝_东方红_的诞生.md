    Congratulating the Birth of "Dongfanghong"
    Dao Qinchenke, Soviet Expert at the First Tractor Factory
    After the Chinese people defeated the Japanese aggressors and the Kuomintang reactionaries and gained liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, they began to transform the "poor and blank" China into a strong industrial country. However, the industrialization of the country is unimaginable without the mechanization of agriculture.
    In 1955, according to the agreement signed with the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union began to design the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant for China. According to the government's decision, the Moscow Automobile Tractor Plant Design Institute undertook the technical design, while the Kharkov Tractor Manufacturing Plant undertook the construction design.
    All the staff of the Kharkov Tractor Plant accepted this glorious task with great pride. The personnel in the factory have been assembled, and the Chinese Tractor Plant Design Section has been formally established. In order to design a modern factory as large as the Luoyang Tractor Plant, it is necessary to draw tens of thousands of drawings of tools, gauges, fixtures, and non-standard equipment, order hundreds of high-efficiency special machine tools, redesign and compile thousands of tractor parts process cards, and review and finalize the technical conditions for tractor collaboration. These tasks must be done because the Luoyang Tractor Plant uses many newer and more advanced equipment than the Kharkov Tractor Plant.
    While the construction design was still in progress, a group of Soviet experts came to Luoyang to directly help the builders of the Chinese tractor factory solve technical problems in construction, installation, and adjustment. I came to Luoyang in October 1957, and I saw the Chinese friends who used to intern with us. With great excitement and emotion, I saw that what we drew on paper at the Kharkov plant had been turned into beautiful reality by our Chinese friends. Magnificent and bright workshops have been erected before my eyes, some workshops have begun to manufacture tools and fixtures, and some workshops have begun to install equipment. In particular, the workers in the tool workshop have begun to manufacture complex tools. What an exciting achievement!
    Arriving in China, I quickly established close friendly relations with the factory's process engineers and designers. At this time, it is necessary to work with Chinese comrades to jointly solve a large number of problems that arise during installation and adjustment. Working with Chinese comrades, I once again saw their enthusiasm and tenacity in resolutely completing the work tasks assigned by the organization.
    1958 was an extraordinary year, and a comprehensive Great Leap Forward situation appeared in China. All the staff in the factory were enthusiastic, full of endless creative power. The installation and adjustment work is developing rapidly; rationalization proposals such as speeding up the construction of the factory, improving quality, and reducing costs are flying in like snowflakes. All this left me with an unforgettable and profound impression.
    Trial production of engines and tractors has begun. Countless various problems have appeared one after another, and these problems must be quickly resolved without hesitation. Under the leadership of the Party Committee and the factory department, all the staff in the factory solved these problems with tenacity.
    The principle of installing, adjusting, and producing at the same time was implemented in the process of building the factory. While accelerating installation and adjustment, all the staff in the factory also produced a certain number of tractors. Now more than 20,000 employees have seen the fruits of their hard work - the "Dongfanghong" brand tractors made of domestic materials and by the workers' own hands have been driven off the final assembly line one after another. This is a great victory for all the staff in the factory.
    This factory has been officially put into production after being handed over for acceptance on November 1. "Dongfanghong" brand tractors are being sent to the fields of people's communes in batches, and to large-scale construction sites. The completion of the Luoyang First Tractor Factory will play a significant role in the technical transformation of Chinese agriculture, in catching up with Britain in the output of major industrial products within ten years, in improving people's living standards, and in accelerating socialist construction.
    All the Soviet experts and the entire Soviet people who directly participated in the construction of China's First Tractor Factory are pleased to see that our joint labor has yielded abundant fruits, and the large-scale First Tractor Factory has been built and put into production.
    When the day of great joy for all the staff of the First Tractor Factory—the opening ceremony—arrives, let all our Soviet experts wish the "Dongfanghong" brand tractors to enjoy a high reputation among farmers and contribute great strength to the technical revolution in agriculture. Let the deep friendship condensed in the joint labor of building the factory be recorded in the history of Sino-Soviet friendship and remain evergreen forever!
    I wish the unbreakable friendship between the great Soviet and Chinese peoples will develop day by day and remain evergreen forever!

    祝“东方红”的诞生
    第一拖拉机制造厂苏联专家　道钦科
    中国人民战胜日本侵略者和国民党反动派获得解放以后，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，开始改变“一穷二白”的中国为强大的工业国。但是实现国家工业化，没有农业的机械化是不可想像的。
    在1955年苏联根据与中华人民共和国签订的协议，开始为中国设计第一拖拉机制造厂。根据政府的决定，莫斯科汽车拖拉机厂设计院承担技术设计，而哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂承担施工设计。
    哈尔科夫拖拉机厂的全体职工以极大的自豪感接受了这一光荣的任务。在厂里已经把人员配齐，中国拖拉机厂设计科正式成立起来了。为了设计像洛阳拖拉机厂这样大的一个现代化工厂，必须绘制成千上万张刀具、量具、夹具和非标准设备图纸，订制数百台高效率的专用机床，重新设计和编制几千个拖拉机零件的工艺过程卡，审查和最后确定拖拉机协作的技术条件。这些工作所以必须要作，是因为在洛阳拖拉机厂采用了很多比哈尔科夫拖拉机厂更新、更先进的设备。
    在施工设计还在进行的时候，为了直接帮助中国拖拉机厂的建设者们解决建筑、安装和调整中的技术问题，一批苏联专家来到洛阳。1957年10月我来到洛阳，我又见到了过去在我们那儿实习的中国朋友。我以极其兴奋和激动的心情看到了我们在哈尔科夫厂绘制在纸上的东西，已被中国朋友变成美妙的现实。宏伟敞亮的车间已经树立在我的眼前，有的车间开始制造工具和夹具，有的车间开始安装设备。特别是工具车间的工人已开始制造复杂的工具，这是多么值得令人兴奋的成绩！
    到了中国，很快就和厂里的工艺师及设计师们建立了紧密的友好关系。这时必须和中国同志在一起共同解决在安装和调整中出现的大批问题。和中国同志在一起工作，我又一次看到了他们那种坚决完成组织上交给的工作任务所表现出的热情和顽强精神。
  1958年是一个不平凡的一年，在中国出现了全面大跃进的局面。全厂职工干劲冲天，热情洋溢，充满了无穷无尽的创造力量。安装和调整工作飞速地向前发展；加快建厂速度，改进质量和降低成本等合理化建议像雪片似地飞来。这一切都给我留下了难忘的深刻印象。
    发动机和拖拉机的试生产开始了。无数的各式各样的问题相继出现，这些问题都必须毫不犹豫地很快解决。全厂职工在党委和厂部的领导下，以顽强的精神解决了这些问题。
    在建厂过程中贯彻执行了边安装、边调整和边生产的方针，全厂职工在加速安装和调整的同时又生产了一定数量的拖拉机。现在两万多名职工已经看到由自己的辛勤劳动所制造的果实——用国产的材料、由工人自己的双手制造的“东方红”牌拖拉机已从总装配线一台一台地开出来。这是全厂职工的伟大胜利。
    这座工厂已经在11月1日交工验收正式投入生产。“东方红”牌拖拉机正成批地开向人民公社的田野，开向规模巨大的建筑工地。洛阳第一拖拉机厂的建成，对中国农业的技术改造，对在十年内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国，对提高人民生活水平以及加速社会主义建设是有着重大的作用的。
    我们直接参加中国第一拖拉机厂建设的所有苏联专家和全体苏联人民都愉快地看到：我们共同的劳动已经获得丰满的果实，规模巨大的第一拖拉机厂已经建成并投入生产。
    当第一拖拉机厂全体职工的大喜日——开工典礼的日子来临的时候，让我们全体苏联专家预祝“东方红”牌拖拉机在农民中享有盛誉，在农业的技术革命中贡献巨大的力量。让我们在建厂的共同劳动中凝结的深厚友谊，载入中苏友谊的史册，永远长青！
    祝伟大的苏中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊日益发展，万古长青！
