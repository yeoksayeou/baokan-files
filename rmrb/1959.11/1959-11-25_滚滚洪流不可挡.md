The Flowing White Dragon River of the Gansu Provincial Drama Troupe

    The Irresistible Torrent
    Li Huizhong
    Those who have seen the Gansu Provincial Drama Troupe's performance of "On the Kangbu'er Grassland" will not forget the strong Tibetan life it brought us. The play's full of political emotion, reflecting the sharp and complex struggles, and its distinct ethnic characteristics, all left a deep impression on people. Now, the Gansu Provincial Drama Troupe has brought the sequel to "On the Kangbu'er Grassland," "The Flowing White Dragon River," to the stage in Beijing. We are pleased to see that this sequel still maintains these strengths of the first part. The difference is that it shows us a new aspect of life for the Tibetan people on the banks of the White Dragon River. It no longer portrays the struggle against the enemy in the early days of liberation, but further demonstrates how the Tibetan people, under the leadership of the Party, are striding towards the socialist path and how they shattered the rebellion of the upper-class reactionary groups. If we rejoiced at the glorious victory of the Party's ethnic policy on the Kangbu'er Grassland when we watched the first play, then after watching this second part, we are even more cheering for the Tibetan people who, under the leadership of the Party, are fighting with high spirits and building socialism with vigor, and cheering for them for kicking away the stumbling blocks on the road ahead with the heroic spirit of the flowing White Dragon River!
    The authors of this play enthusiastically praised the growth of advanced figures among the Tibetan people. We see that the slaves who have suffered exploitation and oppression for generations have become the masters of their lives, and some of them are growing into communists. From them, we can no longer find a trace of slaves; from them, we feel the pulse of the times beating. The heroine, Namtso, was a slave of the Jiao Ba chieftain since she was a child. After liberation, she gained freedom, became the director of the cooperative under the guidance of the Party, and joined the Party. The authors shaped this image, which is very encouraging. Although we have slightly less opportunity to see her husband, Jinba Cailang, we can still feel the growth of this young man who has become the district armed officer. With such loyal and brave people, our socialist construction will inevitably be invincible and indestructible. The image of Grandpa Karte is real and vivid. We feel affectionately that he seems to live by our side. He is loyal to the Party and dares to uphold the truth in the face of the enemy. We saw that he had not yet completely freed himself from the spiritual shackles of religious forces at the beginning, and he still had illusions about class enemies. Once the enemy's bullets hit his chest, he woke up, threw away the prayer wheel he had believed in for seventy-six years, and criticized his muddled ideas. At this time, we deeply realized that he had truly stood up, and his sacrifice aroused people's unparalleled anger towards the bandits and aroused people's passion to thoroughly eliminate the bandits to defend socialism.
    In addition, in terms of characterization, the rebel leader Jiao Ba chieftain is written with depth. The more thoroughly this character is exposed, the more it will help to show the wisdom and strength of the people.
    The compelling plot of the play is also a strength of this play. For example, Jiao Ba set up a carefully arranged trap, just waiting for Secretary Fang to fall into the trap; for example, the rebel leader Genden, who stole the position of deputy district chief, was lurking next to Secretary Fang, which aroused the audience's suspense. These plot arrangements are very helpful for portraying the characters.
    If the authors' writing power is not too scattered, and they can focus on portraying several main characters to make their images more prominent; if they can sort out the main clues from the complicated conflicts and make them more distinct; if they can write more fully about the ideological basis of Caibuden's betrayal when dealing with the important plot of Caibuden's betrayal; I think that it will definitely more powerfully show the momentum of the irresistible socialist torrent, and more able to encourage people to fight to defend socialism!

专栏：甘肃省话剧团的滚滚的白龙江

    滚滚洪流不可挡
    李慧中
    看过甘肃省话剧团演出的“在康布尔草原上”的人，不会忘记这出戏所带给我们的浓烈的藏族人民的生活气息。这出戏的政治感情的饱满，所反映的斗争的尖锐和复杂，民族色彩的鲜明，都给人留下了深刻的印象。现在，甘肃省话剧团又把“在康布尔草原上”的续篇“滚滚的白龙江”带到了北京的舞台上。我们高兴地看到了这个续篇仍然保持了第一部的这些长处。所不同的是，它向我们展示了白龙江畔藏族人民的新的生活面貌。它所表现的已经不是解放初期的对敌斗争，而是更进一步地表现了藏族人民在党的领导下如何大踏步地奔向社会主义大道，如何粉碎了上层反动集团的叛乱。如果我们看第一部戏时，曾为党的民族政策在康布尔草原上的光辉胜利而欢欣鼓舞的话，那么，看过这第二部，我们更为藏族人民在党的领导下斗志昂扬、意气风发地建设社会主义而欢呼，为他们以滚滚的白龙江般的英雄气概踢开前进道路上的绊脚石而欢呼！
    这出戏的作者们热情地歌颂了藏族人民中先进人物的成长。我们看到世世代代受尽剥削压迫的奴隶已经成了生活的主人，他们当中有些人正成长为共产主义者。从他们身上，我们再也找不到一点奴隶的影子；从他们身上，我们感到了时代脉搏的跳动。女主人公娜姆错从小就是焦巴头人的奴隶，解放后，她获得了自由，在党的教导下成为合作社主任，并且入了党。作者们塑造了这个形象，是很能给人以鼓舞力量的。她的丈夫金巴才郎尽管和我们见面的机会略嫌少了些，但我们仍然能感到这个已经成为区武装干事的年青人的成长。有了这样忠诚而勇敢的人们，我们的社会主义建设必然是无往不胜、无坚不摧的。卡尔泰老爷爷的形象真实而生动。我们亲切地感到他仿佛就生活在我们身边。他对党忠心耿耿，在敌人面前敢于坚持真理。我们看到他开始时还未能完全摆脱宗教力量对他的精神上的束缚，对阶级敌人还存在着幻想，一旦敌人的子弹打进了他的胸膛，他惊醒了，他扔掉了信奉了七十六年的经轮，批判了自己的糊涂观念。这时候，我们深深地体会到他真正地站起来了，他的牺牲激起了人们对叛匪的无比的愤怒，激起人们为保卫社会主义而彻底消灭叛匪的激情。
    此外，在人物塑造方面，叛匪头子焦巴头人写的还是有深度的。对这个人物揭露的越深刻，就越发有助于表现人民的智慧和力量。
    戏剧情节的引人入胜，也是这出戏的长处。比如，焦巴设下了布置严密的陷井，单等方书记中计；比如，就在方书记身旁潜藏着窃取了副区长职位的叛匪头子之一根登等，都引起观众的悬念。这些情节的安排对刻划人物性格很有好处。
    如果作者们笔力不过于分散，能集中地刻划几个主要人物，使他们的形象更加突出些；如果能够从错综复杂的冲突中把主要的线索理出来，使之更鲜明些；如果在处理才布登叛变这一重要情节时，能把才布登叛国的思想根据写的更充分些；我想，那一定会更有力地表现出不可阻挡的社会主义洪流的气势，更能够鼓舞人们为保卫社会主义而斗争！
