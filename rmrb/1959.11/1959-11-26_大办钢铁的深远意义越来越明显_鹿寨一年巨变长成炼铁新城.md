The profound significance of the mass steelmaking movement is becoming increasingly apparent.
Luzhai Undergoes a Year of Tremendous Change, Growing into a New Iron and Steel City
Newly built blast furnaces, once put into production, can supply 70% of Guangxi's iron casting needs.

Nanning, November 25th - Luzhai, Guangxi, which achieved great success in the mass steelmaking movement last year, has leaped to become one of Guangxi's major iron and steel bases in this year of tremendous change. Once the renovated No. 2 blast furnace and the newly built No. 3 blast furnace are put into production, over 70% of the cast iron for the machinery industry in Guangxi will come from the Liuzhou Iron and Steel Plant's Luzhai branch.

Underneath Changgu Ridge, on the beautiful banks of the Luoqing River, the 83.5 cubic meter Nos. 3 and 4 blast furnaces stand tall on Jinji Yuan. Hot blast stoves, dust collectors, and water towers stand majestically before the blast furnaces. Huge gas pipes and hot air pipes snake around the furnace bodies like dragons. The two 38 cubic meter Nos. 1 and 2 blast furnaces, tall chimneys, and the coke oven clusters of the distant coking plant emit puffs of green smoke and spray dazzling flames. On the crisscrossing "Lu Steel" railway branch line and the highway, trains, carts, and trucks transporting ore, coke, and construction materials shuttle back and forth. Who would know that this place, known as a "new iron and steel city in the Great Leap Forward," was just a barren mountain ridge overgrown with weeds a little over a year ago?

The Great Leap Forward and the mass steelmaking movement of 1958 enabled Guangxi's iron and steel industry to develop rapidly. In July of last year, Guangxi's first iron-smelting blast furnace was built in Luzhai, and the first batch of molten iron flowed out. With the development of the mass steelmaking movement, it was decided to expand it into an iron-smelting joint enterprise with an annual output of 100,000 tons of pig iron. The heroes trained in indigenous blast furnaces, lacking mechanized construction equipment and technical expertise, displayed a spirit of daring to think and act, completing a 35-meter-high, 6-meter-diameter hot blast stove chimney in 37 hours and a 30-meter-high, 500-ton water tower in 40 hours. During the installation of the new power station this August and September, the method of using "native" methods to install "foreign" equipment was adopted, completing the project three months ahead of schedule.

The construction of "Lu Steel" progressed rapidly, and production changed with each passing day. Since the beginning of this year, the two 28 cubic meter blast furnaces have continuously achieved comprehensive harvests of high yield, high quality, and low consumption. In particular, production has surged since August and September. In November, with the No. 2 blast furnace still undergoing repairs, the No. 1 blast furnace produced 684 tons of pig iron in just twenty days during the first ten days of the month. This figure is equivalent to 86% of the total monthly output in October. In the first ten days of November, the qualified rate of pig iron reached 90.7%; the utilization coefficient averaged 0.793, an increase of 0.12 compared to October; the coke ratio was 0.713, a decrease of 0.1 compared to October; and costs in October decreased by 40% compared to September.

During production and construction, the factory's technical strength has rapidly grown, and hundreds of people have become iron-smelting workers with a certain level of technical expertise. Over the past year, it has trained 972 iron-smelting workers for various fraternal factories and has successively organized 43 "blast furnace start-up teams" to provide technical guidance to other iron-smelting plants.

    大办钢铁的深远意义越来越明显
    鹿寨一年巨变长成炼铁新城
    新建高炉投入生产以后可供广西70％铸造用铁
    本报南宁25日电　去年大办钢铁获得巨大成绩的广西鹿寨，在这沸腾巨变的一年中，一跃而成为广西主要的钢铁基地之一。到改建的二号高炉和新建的三号高炉投入生产后，广西全区将有70％以上机械工业的铸造生铁来自柳州钢铁厂鹿寨分厂。
    在长古岭下绮丽的洛清河畔，八十三点五立方米的三、四号高炉，屹立在金鸡园上，热风炉、除尘器、蓄水塔在高炉面前威风凛凛，巨大的煤气管、热风管游龙似的围着炉体，两座三十八立方米的一、二号高炉，高大的烟囱和远处炼焦场的焦炉群，冒着团团的青烟，喷着耀眼的火光，纵横交错的“鹿钢”铁路支线上，公路上，来往奔驰着运送矿石、焦炭、建筑材料的火车、斗车、汽车，宿舍、办公室、食堂排列在线路的两侧。这一切有谁知道这座被人称为“大跃进中的钢铁新城”，一年多以前还是光山秃岭，杂草丛生的地方呢？
    大跃进、大办钢铁的1958年，广西钢铁工业才有了飞跃发展。去年7月广西第一座炼铁高炉在鹿寨建成，流出了第一炉铁水。随着大办钢铁运动的开展，决定在这里扩建成年产十万吨生铁的炼铁联合企业，土高炉培训起来的英雄们在没有机械化施工设备，技术力量缺乏的条件下，发挥敢想敢干精神，用三十七小时建成了高三十五米、直径六米的热风炉烟囱，四十小时完成一座高三十米、容水五百吨的水塔。今年8、9月间，在安装新电站过程中，采用了以“土”装“洋”的办法，提前三个月完工。
    “鹿钢”建设一日千里，生产上更是日新月异，今年以来两座二十八立方米的高炉不断获得高产、优质、低耗的全面丰收，特别是8、9月以来产量猛增。11月二号高炉检修未完，一号高炉在上中旬仅用二十天的时间，就生产了六百八十四吨生铁。这个数字，等于10月份全月产量的86％。11月上中旬，生铁合格率达到90.7％；利用系数平均达到零点七九三，比10月份上升零点一二；焦比零点七一三，比10月份下降零点一；成本10月份比9月份降低40％。
    在生产建设中，全厂技术力量迅速成长壮大，已有数以百计的人成为具有一定技术水平的炼铁工人。一年来为各兄弟厂培训了九百七十二名炼铁工人，先后组织了四十三人次的“高炉开炉队”到其他炼铁厂进行技术指导。
