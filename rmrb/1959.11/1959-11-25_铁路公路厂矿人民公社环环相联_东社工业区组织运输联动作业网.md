Railroads, Highways, Factories, Mines, and People's Communes Closely Linked
    Dongshe Industrial Zone Organizes Joint Transportation Network Operations
    Methods: Dedicated lines, shunting locomotives, loading and unloading labor, loading and unloading machinery, communication equipment, self-provided vehicles, and transportation tools are under unified command and used jointly.
    Results: Daily reduction of 88 train cars of loading and unloading at the station; average reduction of 4 kilometers in handling distance; shortening of vehicle dwell time at the station by nearly one and a half hours.

    (Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 24th dispatch) Under the guidance of the mass mobilization of transportation policy, the Dongshe Station of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, the Taiyuan Transportation Company, and the loading and unloading teams of factories, mines, and local people's communes have closely cooperated to create a joint transportation operation model, greatly reducing the station's loading and unloading volume, shortening the handling distance, and accelerating vehicle turnover. In the third quarter of this year alone, the vehicles saved could transport more than 80,000 tons of coal.

    The joint operation network consists of three parts: "unified command, zonal collaboration," "mutual exchange, seven major shared aspects" (i.e., dedicated lines shared, shunting locomotives shared, loading and unloading labor shared, loading and unloading machinery shared, communication equipment shared, transportation tools shared, and self-provided vehicles shared), mutual guarantees, and vigorous "opponent competitions" and "relay competitions." After the Taiyuan Dongshe Station and other units implemented this cooperative relationship, the railway and highways, the railway and factories and mines, the highways and factories and mines, the people's communes and the railway, and between the factories and mines were interconnected at every level. This reduced the station's loading and unloading workload by 88 train cars per day, with an average reduction of 4 kilometers in the handling distance of these materials, equivalent to a daily savings of 1,224 horse-drawn carts. The capacity of various transportation equipment was tapped, and labor was comprehensively used, reducing the vehicle dwell time at the station from an average of 15 hours and 12 minutes in the first half of 1959 to 13 hours and 48 minutes in the third quarter, saving a total of 48,121 car-hours, equivalent to saving 2,047 cars, and transporting an additional 81,880 tons of coal.

    The Dongshe area is one of the industrial production and construction bases in the western suburbs of Taiyuan City. There are a total of 59 newly built enterprises of various sizes here. Highways extend in all directions, and the newly built dedicated railway lines have a total length of 49 kilometers, forming a vast dedicated line network.

    The transportation tasks undertaken by the Dongshe Station are very heavy, with an average daily loading and unloading volume of more than 200 cars, making it one of the main bases for unloading and organizing train flows in the Taiyuan Railway Bureau. It not only undertakes the transportation tasks of supplying raw materials and exporting finished products for 59 factories and mines but also undertakes the task of dispatching empty cars to the Xishan Coal Mine branch line for coal loading.

    Since the continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the volume of goods dispatched from Dongshe Station has greatly increased. From January to September 1959, the dispatch volume increased by 20% compared with the same period in 1958, and the arrival volume increased by 44%. Due to the large volume of transportation, rapid growth, and small freight yard, a tense situation arose with unloading and loading falling behind and goods unable to be moved. In order to better organize the busy transportation tasks in the Dongshe area, under the leadership of the station's Party branch, the characteristics of the Dongshe area's transportation work were studied, the flow of goods was investigated, and special personnel were dispatched to inspect the terrain of each dedicated line, look for cargo locations, and register sites where unloading could be utilized. Consultations were also held among enterprises and factories on the joint use of dedicated lines. Then, according to the type of goods, the volume of transportation, and the handling distance, the station, the unit owning the dedicated line, and the user jointly signed a tripartite contract, stipulating the sharing of maintenance costs, methods for connecting goods, and relevant safety operating procedures. Starting with the joint use of dedicated lines provided the prerequisite for the joint operation network.

    In order to unify the complex transportation operations in the Dongshe area, the railway, highway systems, and factories and mines formed the "Dongshe Station Area Transportation Joint Collaboration Office," with the stationmaster as the leader. Enterprises with large transportation volumes were selected as deputy leaders, and relevant units participated. The daily command work was the responsibility of the station dispatcher, and two operation zones, Dongshe and Beiyan, were established. According to the distribution of dedicated line users, it was divided into seven collaboration zones, each including three to seven collaboration units. For example, the mining area included three units: Xiyu Coal Mine, Gypsum Factory, and Nanyu Coal Mine. All units within the collaboration zone cooperated fully and without distinction. For example, the Taiyuan Textile Factory did not have loading and unloading labor, so the Phosphate Fertilizer Factory in the collaboration zone took on all of it. The supports transported to the Nanyu Coal Mine were unloaded at the Xiyu Coal Mine's cargo location; the Xiyu Coal Mine actively cleared the cargo location for the Nanyu Coal Mine in order to ensure quick loading and unloading. The labor combination between collaboration zones was resolved through the operation zones. This collaboration organization facilitated both mutual cooperation and centralized command.

    After the collaboration zones were established, the scope of collaboration in daily transportation work became wider and wider, and the content of collaboration became more and more specific, forming seven major shared aspects in the use of manpower and materials.

    1. Joint use of dedicated lines. The dedicated lines that originally served only 12 households were opened to 40 users, based on the distribution of factories and mines, equipment conditions, and transportation capacity. 2. Joint use of shunting locomotives and locomotives. Factory locomotives can shunt at the station, and locomotives from one factory can be transferred to another. This practice greatly enhanced the effectiveness of the locomotives. According to statistics from January to August this year, locomotives cooperated a total of 341 times between stations and factories and between factories. 3. Joint use of loading and unloading labor. Enterprises and factories in the Dongshe area generally have loading and unloading labor, and individual units adopted labor assistance, but the transportation volume fluctuated greatly, resulting in loading and unloading labor sometimes being idle and sometimes being too busy. Joint use of loading and unloading labor overcame these shortcomings. 4. Joint use of loading and unloading machinery. 5. Joint use of communication equipment. 6. Joint use of short-distance transportation forces. The short-distance transportation and handling work in the Dongshe area was mostly undertaken by the Municipal Transportation Company, which had 950 small flatbed trucks. Various enterprises and units also had their own trucks and horse-drawn carts. In order to concentrate the use of forces, under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee, the short-distance transportation and handling forces were under unified control, including the vehicles owned by each enterprise. Each unit submitted monthly handling plans to the Transportation Company, and the Transportation Company uniformly allocated vehicles. This highly centralized method of use facilitated the exploitation of the potential of equipment, ensured the completion of transportation tasks, and promoted communist cooperation, combining long-distance and short-distance transportation. 7. Joint use of self-provided vehicles.

    Since the continuous leap forward in 1959, the workers and staff in the Dongshe area have actively responded to the Party's call for "demanding vehicles from time, and demanding efficiency from cooperation." The station's workers and staff have tried every means to meet the transportation needs of production, vigorously carrying out opponent competitions and relay competitions to accelerate vehicle turnover. Factories and mining enterprises implemented the idea of a double leap forward in production and transportation, and while ensuring the completion of production tasks, they focused on transportation work. Jinxi Machine Factory also launched a competition within the factory to compare safety, loading and unloading car tasks, number of collaborations, and attendance rate, greatly strengthening the idea of collaboration. Before the competition was launched, crane drivers in the factory were unwilling to support the station, considering it "extra" work. After the competition was launched, it was stipulated that each dispatch would be counted as a collaboration number, and the drivers actively inquired about whether there was work in the station and arrived whenever they were called. Sometimes, in order to ensure the completion of the monthly shift plan, the factory's shunting team participated in rushing to load and unload. As a result of station-factory collaboration and the vigorous mass movement, the parking time was reduced from 9 hours in January to 3.09 hours in September. The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory held daily meetings between transportation, supply and marketing, and the station to study the connection between factory transportation and railway transportation, arrange loading, unloading, pickup and delivery operations, and solve problems in a timely manner, which also reduced the parking time from 21 hours and 12 minutes in May to 8 hours and 6 minutes in August. Xiyu Coal Mine launched a quick loading and unloading red flag competition movement centered on ensuring red flag direct trains, reducing the loading time from 2 hours and 40 minutes per batch of 20 cars in the past to 1 hour and 20 minutes.

    铁路公路厂矿人民公社环环相联
    东社工业区组织运输联动作业网
    做法：　专用线、调车机车、装卸劳力、装卸机械、通讯设备、自备车辆、运输工具统一指挥共同使用
    效果：　每天减轻车站装卸量八十八车；平均缩短四公里的搬运距离；缩短车辆停站时间近一个半小时
    本报太原24日电　在群众办运输的方针指导下，太原铁路局东社车站、太原市运输公司和工厂、矿山以及当地人民公社的装卸作业队密切配合，创造了组织运输联动作业的形式，大大减轻车站装卸量，缩短搬运距离，加速车辆周转；仅今年第三季度节省的车辆，就可多运煤炭八万多吨。
    联动作业网由“统一指挥，分区协作”，“互通有无，七大共用”（即专用线共同使用、调车机车共同使用、装卸劳动力共同使用、装卸机械共同使用、通讯设备共同使用、运输工具共同使用、自备车辆共同使用）及互相保证，大搞“对手赛”、“连环赛”等三部分组成。太原东社车站等单位贯彻了这种协作关系以后，使铁路与公路、铁路与厂矿、公路与厂矿、人民公社与铁路、厂矿之间，节节相通，环环相连。每天减轻了车站八十八车的装卸作业量，这些物资平均缩短四公里搬运距离，等于每天节省一千二百二十四辆马车的搬运力。挖掘各项运输设备的能力，综合地使用劳力，使车辆在站的停留时间，由1959年上半年平均十五小时又十二分钟，压缩到第三季度的十三小时四十八分钟，共节省四万八千一百二十一车小时，等于节省两千零四十七辆车，多运八万一千八百八十吨煤炭。
    东社地区是太原市西郊的工业生产和建设基地之一。这里新建的大小企业共有五十九个。公路四通八达，新建成的铁路专用线总长度达四十九公里，形成一个庞大的专用线网。
    东社车站担负的运输任务，非常繁重，每日平均装卸车在二百辆以上，是太原铁路局卸车和组织车流主要基地之一，它不仅担负着五十九个工厂、矿山的原料供应和成品输出的运输任务，同时还担负着向西山煤矿支线排送空车装煤的任务。
    工农业生产继续跃进以来，东社车站的发运量大大增加。1959年1至9月份比1958年同期发送量提高了20％，到达量提高了44％。由于运量大，来势猛，货场小，出现了卸不下来，装不上去，搬不走的紧张局面。为了把东社地区繁忙的运输任务组织得更好，在车站党支部的领导下，研究了东社区运输工作的特点，对货物流向进行了调查，并派专人分别到各专用线查看地形，寻找货位，对能利用卸车的场地，进行登记。在企业厂矿间对共同使用专用线的问题也进行了协商。然后根据货物种类，运量大小，搬运距离，由车站、专用线所属单位，使用单位共同签订三角合同，定出维修费的分担，货物交接联系办法和安全作业等有关制度。从专用线共同使用开始，给联动作业网提供了先决条件。
    为了将东社区繁杂的运输作业统一起来，铁路、公路系统与厂矿组成“东社站区运输联合协作办公室”，由车站站长任组长。选择运量大的企业为副组长，有关单位参加。日常指挥工作由车站调度员负责，下设东社、北堰两个作业区。并根据专用线使用单位的分布情况，划分为七个协作区，每一个协作区包括三至七个协作单位。例如矿区包括有：西峪煤矿、石膏厂、南峪煤矿三个单位。协作区内各单位通力协作不分彼此。例如太原纺织厂，没有装卸劳动力，就由协作区的磷肥厂全部担当。运到南峪煤矿的支柱，就卸在西峪煤矿的货位；西峪煤矿为了保证作到快装快卸，主动替南峪煤矿将货位腾空。协作区与协作区的劳力组合，则通过作业区来解决。这个协作组织，既便于互相协作，又便于集中指挥。
    协作区建成以后，在日常运输工作中，协作的面越来越大，协作的内容越来越具体，在人力物力的运用上形成了七大共用。
    一、专用线共同使用。把原来只供十二户使用的专用线，根据厂矿分布情况，设备条件，运输能力，开放为四十家使用。二、调车、机车共同使用。厂内机车可以到车站调车，这一厂的机车也可以调到那一厂去。这种做法，大大发挥了机车的效用。根据今年1至8月份的统计，站、厂间及厂与厂间，机车共协作三百四十一次。三、装卸劳动力共同使用。东社区各企业厂矿，一般的都备有装卸劳动力，个别单位采取劳力互助，但运输量波动很大，造成装卸劳动力有时窝工有时忙不过来。装卸劳动力共同使用以后，就克服了这些缺点。四、装卸机械共同使用。五、通讯设备共同使用。六、共同使用短途运输力量。东社区短途运输的运搬工作大部分由市运输公司承当，拥有九百五十辆小平车，各企业单位也备有汽车、马车。为了集中使用力量，在市委、市人委统一领导下，统一掌握短途运输搬运力量，包括各企业自备的车辆在内，各单位统一向运输公司提出月度搬运计划，由运输公司统一分配车辆。这种高度集中的使用方法，既便于挖掘设备的潜在力量，保证运输任务的完成，又能促进共产主义大协作，使长、短途运输互相结合。七、自备车辆共同使用。
    1959年继续跃进以来，东社区职工们积极响应了党的“向时间要车，向协作要效率”的口号，车站职工们千方百计地满足生产上对运输的需要，大搞对手赛、连环赛，来加速车辆周转。厂矿企业贯彻了生产运输双跃进的思想，在保证完成生产任务的同时，抓紧运输工作。晋西机器厂厂内也开展了比安全、比装卸车任务、比协作次数、比出勤率的竞赛，大大加强了协作思想。在没有开展竞赛前，厂内吊车司机不愿支援车站，认为是“额外”工作，竞赛开展后，规定每出动一次，算一次协作数，司机们便主动询问站内有无作业，随叫随到。有时为了保证月班计划的完成，厂内调车组参加抢装抢卸。站、厂协作，大搞群众运动的结果，停车时间由1月份的九小时，到9月份压缩到三点零九小时。太原重型机器厂每天建立运输、供销、车站三方面碰头会，研究厂内运输与铁路运输的衔接，安排装卸取送作业，发现问题及时解决，也使停车时间由5月份的二十一小时十二分钟，缩短到8月份的八小时六分钟。西峪煤矿开展以保证红旗直达列车为中心的快装快卸红旗竞赛运动，装车时间由过去每批二十辆需要二小时四十分，压缩到一小时二十分。
