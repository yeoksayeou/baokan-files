Xinhua News Agency, 27th - The Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and the Ministry of Health recently jointly issued instructions on vigorously carrying out the prevention and control of winter and spring infectious diseases.

The instructions stated: This autumn, inspired by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all regions conscientiously implemented the spirit of the "Report on Carrying Out the Summer and Autumn Patriotic Health Campaign" approved and transmitted by the Central Committee of the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and the Party Group of the Ministry of Health, and launched a high tide of pest elimination and disease prevention movement focused on eliminating mosquitoes and flies, preventing and controlling intestinal infectious diseases, and carrying out large-scale sanitation. Great achievements have been made. The "four pests" have generally been reduced in all regions, and the incidence of diseases has been significantly reduced. The vast urban and rural areas have basically achieved the requirement of being clean and tidy to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.

The instructions stated: This winter is a decisive stage for completing and overfulfilling the major targets of the country's Second Five-Year Plan, and it is also an important opportunity for rural areas to engage in winter water conservancy construction, accumulate and manufacture fertilizer, improve soil, cultivate land, manage fields, and engage in "short-distance transportation" and other sideline production. At the same time, this winter has been cold early, and the possibility of the expansion and prevalence of winter and spring infectious diseases is greater. Therefore, we should vigorously carry out the prevention and control of winter and spring infectious diseases with the spirit of opposing right-leaning and boosting energy, protect people's health, and support production and construction. This is a task that brooks no delay at present.

The instructions put forward the following requirements for the sanitation work in various regions this winter and next spring.

First, the Patriotic Health Campaign Committees and Health Departments/Bureaus of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions should strengthen their leadership over the prevention and control of winter and spring infectious diseases, improve the working bodies for pest elimination and disease prevention, and comprehensively plan and make overall arrangements in accordance with the principle of serving production and closely combining with the center of winter and spring production, and take effective measures to prevent the prevalence of winter and spring infectious diseases. In case of occurrence, they must be quickly extinguished to prevent spread. In the propaganda of the general line and large-scale production, appropriate contents of pest elimination, disease eradication, and disease prevention should be added to make the broad masses of people more clearly understand the important significance of health work in serving production. Under the unified leadership of the Party committees at all levels, strengthen the collaboration of trade unions, the Communist Youth League, women's federations, Red Cross societies, and relevant departments such as agriculture, water conservancy, education, and civil affairs, and organize three surprise movements for pest elimination and disease eradication around the New Year, Spring Festival, and Qingming Festival, and pay attention to improving the quality of regular work.

Second, under the leadership of the local Party committees, the health departments at all levels should take the following measures: in accordance with the principle of combining prevention and treatment and giving priority to prevention, and the policy of combining Chinese and Western medicine and combining indigenous and foreign methods, adopt comprehensive measures to achieve early detection, early isolation, and early treatment, so that diseases can be eliminated wherever they occur; improve the epidemic reporting network, conscientiously implement the epidemic ten-day reporting system, and take effective measures to immediately extinguish serious epidemics when they are discovered and report them at any time; both cities and villages should promote methods such as dividing areas for contracting or land section responsibility according to different situations, and strive to "prevent patients from going out and medicine being delivered to the door" from the needs of preventing and controlling winter and spring infectious diseases; organize medical and health personnel to go deep into factories, mines, construction sites, and people's communes to strengthen technical guidance on the prevention and control of winter and spring infectious diseases, the elimination of the "four pests," and hygiene, and further improve the health knowledge level of the broad masses of people; strengthen the management of food hygiene, strictly disinfect eating utensils, do not eat raw, cold, or corrupt food, strengthen the health education of employees in the catering service industry, and pay attention to water source protection to prevent the spread of disease sources and cause disease epidemics.

The instructions require that the Patriotic Health Campaign Committees and health departments in various regions formulate specific measures for preventing and controlling infectious diseases in their respective regions this winter and next spring, and implement them accordingly.

    指示说：今秋，各地在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，认真贯彻了中央批转的中央爱国卫生运动委员会、卫生部党组“关于开展夏秋季卫生运动的报告”的精神，掀起了一个以消灭蚊蝇、防治肠道传染病、大搞卫生的除害灭病运动高潮，取得很大成绩。各地四害普遍减少，疾病的发病率显著降低，广大城乡基本上达到了干干净净迎接建国十周年的要求。
    指示说：今冬是完成和超额完成国家第二个五年计划各项主要指标的决定性阶段，也是农村大搞冬季修水利、积肥造肥、改良土壤、耕种土地、田间管理，以及“短途运输”和其他副业生产的重要时机，同时今冬冷得早，冬春季传染病扩大流行的可能性更大，因此应以反右倾鼓干劲的精神，大力开展冬春季传染病的防治工作，保护人民健康，支援生产建设。这是当前刻不容缓的任务。
    指示对各地今冬明春的卫生工作，提出以下几点要求。
    一、各省、市、自治区爱国卫生运动委员会和卫生厅、局应加强对冬春季传染病防治工作的领导，健全除害灭病的办事机构，在为生产服务、紧密结合冬春季生产中心的原则下全面规划，统筹安排，采取有效措施，不让冬春季传染病流行；万一发生，必须迅速扑灭，不使蔓延。在总路线和大生产的宣传中，适当加入除害、灭病、防病的内容，使广大群众更加明确卫生工作为生产服务的重要意义。在各级党委的统一领导下，加强工、青、妇、红十字会和农业、水利、教育、民政等有关部门的协作，在新年、春节、清明前后，组织三次除害灭病的突击运动，并注意提高经常工作质量。
    二、各级卫生部门应在当地党委的领导下，采取下列各项措施：根据防治结合、以防为主的原则和中西结合、土洋并举的方针，采用综合措施，做到早期发现、早期隔离、早期治疗，使疾病在哪里发生，就在哪里消灭；健全疫情报告网，认真执行疫情旬报制度，发现严重疫情必须采取有效措施立即扑灭并随时上报；城市和乡村都应按照不同情况，推行划片包干或地段责任制等办法，从防治冬春季传染病的需要出发，争取做到“病人不出门，医药送上门”；组织医药卫生人员深入厂矿、工地、人民公社，加强有关防治冬春季传染病、除四害、讲卫生的技术指导，进一步提高广大群众的卫生知识水平；加强饮食卫生的管理，食具严格消毒，不吃生冷腐败的食物，加强饮食服务行业从业人员的卫生教育，注意水源保护，以防病源散布，造成疾病流行。
    指示要求各地爱国卫生运动委员会和卫生部门根据本地区具体情况，订出本地区今冬明春防治传染病的具体措施，贯彻执行。
