    The Soviet Union Helps France Build a Panoramic Cinema
    A panoramic cinema built with Soviet equipment opened in Paris on September 23. After the opening, the Soviet film "Two Hours in the Soviet Union" was shown and received a grand welcome.
    The cinema's manager, Ankeshimi, said: "Today, so many people gathered at the cinema's ticket office that we had to ask the police to maintain order. Tickets for the next week have already sold out. The audience's keen interest can be explained by two reasons: First, our panoramic cinema was built by Russian engineers, who adopted a more interesting and novel method than the American Cinerama panoramic film, thus achieving amazing results; second, the film we are showing is a documentary film made by the famous Soviet photographer and director, Karman, in which the audience can travel around the Soviet Union in two hours." Some Parisian newspapers published reviews of the new cinema. "Le Jour" believes that the Soviet panoramic film is superior to the American Cinerama.

    苏联帮助法国建成一座全景电影院
    用苏联装备建成的一座全景电影院已于9月23日在巴黎开幕。会后放映了苏联影片：“在苏联两小时”，获得了盛大的欢迎。
    电影院的经理安克什米说：“今天在电影院的售票处聚集了这么多的人，以致不得不请求警察来维持秩序。最近一个星期内的门票已销售一空。观众的热烈兴趣可以用两个理由来解释：第一，我们的全景电影院是由俄国工程师建造的，他们采用了比美国宽银幕全景电影更有趣、更新颖的方法，因而获得了令人惊异的效果；其次，我们所放映的影片是一部由苏联著名摄影师和导演卡尔缅摄制的纪录影片，在两小时内，观众可以周游苏联全国。”巴黎的一些报纸发表了关于这个新电影院的评论。“震旦报”认为苏联的全景电影比美国的宽银幕全景电影更为出色。
