The Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government, disregarding the strong opposition of the broad Japanese people, is clamoring that it is preparing to sign a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" with the United States in mid-January next year, and formally conclude an aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance. Regarding the aggressive nature of this military alliance, Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama made a most blatant confession a few days ago. Fujiyama openly clamored at the extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet: The area covered by the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will be centered on Japan, including areas north of the Philippines, coastal areas of China, and border areas of the Soviet Maritime Territory. Fujiyama also particularly emphasized that the operational scope of U.S. troops stationed in Japan can include the interior of China and the Soviet Union; and openly admitted that Japan is currently negotiating with the United States on the issue of transporting important equipment, including nuclear weapons, into Japan.

Fujiyama Aiichiro's clamor is a major exposure of the military collusion between the United States and Japanese reactionaries, the revival of Japanese militarism, the hostility towards China and the Soviet Union, the expansion into Southeast Asia, and the planning of new war conspiracies in the Far East.

Since the United States and the Kishi Nobusuke government began to brew the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," we have repeatedly warned that the aggressive nature of this treaty, and the threats it poses to China and the Soviet Union, to Southeast Asian countries, and to peace and security in the Far East and Asia. However, until now, some people in Japan and other countries have not fully believed this. Now, Aiichiro Fujiyama has confessed without being pressed. Please see, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have extended the scope of so-called "security" and "defense" to "areas north of the Philippines, coastal areas of China, and border areas of the Soviet Maritime Territory." Not only that, they even extended the scope of "security" and "defense" to the interior of China and the Soviet Union. Is there any reason other than for the purpose of aggression and expansion that allows one's own "defense" scope to be extended to the territory of other countries? In fact, this kind of fallacy is not a new thing to us. Hasn't the United States openly claimed that the Western Pacific is its defense front line? When Japanese militarists launched the war of aggression against China more than 20 years ago, and later launched the Pacific War, didn't they also declare that China, East Asia, and the Pacific were Japan's lifeline? Therefore, the matter has become clear, and there is no need to have any doubts about the aggressive nature of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to be revised.

The new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to be signed is not, as the United States said, "a treaty negotiated between two equal partners," but a product of collusion and mutual exploitation between U.S. imperialism and the Japanese monopoly capital group represented by Kishi Nobusuke.

As far as the United States is concerned, in recent years, the aggressive and expansionist policy of U.S. imperialism has suffered continuous failures under the attack of world peace forces, thus plunging itself into an increasingly isolated position. In order to get rid of its political isolation and strategic predicament, U.S. imperialism is releasing a smokescreen of peace, pretending to be conciliatory, attempting to use this method to deceive the American people, paralyze the world people's will to fight against imperialism and strive for peace, and cover up its activities of intensifying arms expansion and war preparation. Militarily, U.S. imperialism is adopting methods such as reducing the production of conventional weapons, concentrating its efforts on developing missile production, expanding missile bases, and actively supporting the resurgence of West German and Japanese militarism, in an attempt to restore its lost military advantage and improve its strategic position. In the eyes of U.S. imperialism, Japan is its most ideal tool for aggression and expansion in the East and for preparing for atomic war. Precisely for this reason, the United States has never relaxed its control over Japan after World War II. The United States also knows very well that the U.S. occupation of Japan has aroused great dissatisfaction among the Japanese people. In order to deceive the Japanese people and ease the anti-American struggle of the Japanese people, it is necessary to give Japan a cloak of independence. Therefore, the United States is eager to sign a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to dress Japan up as an "equal" partner of the United States, to intensify the revival of Japanese militarism, and attempt to further tie Japan to the U.S. war chariot, making Japan an atomic base and accomplice for U.S. aggression and expansion in the Far East, and pulling chestnuts out of the fire for the United States.

From the perspective of Japan's situation, there are also deep historical and social roots for the Japanese monopoly capital group to take the road of militarism. Japan was originally an imperialist country that started its business through militarism. The Japanese monopoly capital, which is the economic foundation of militarism, has not only not been destroyed after the war, but has also undergone rapid recovery and great development under the wings and support of U.S. imperialism and under the stimulation of the Korean War. As of August this year, Japan's industrial and mining production has reached 2.7 times the pre-war level. Under such circumstances, the nature of Japanese monopoly capital determines that it does not solve its developing difficulties by developing peaceful production and developing equal and mutually beneficial trade and economic relations with Asian and African countries; but seeks a way out from developing military industries and expanding abroad. According to the taste of Japanese monopoly capital, only by taking the road of militarism can the military industry make a lot of money, and only by taking the road of militarism can foreign expansion be realized and foreign markets be opened for them. Japanese famous writer Tatsuzo Ishikawa said it right: The reason why Japanese monopoly capital is eager to realize the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is because Japan, with the support of the United States, can make a lot of money in Japan's steel industry and chemical industry by vigorously reviving militarism, and the import of nuclear weapons into Japan and the atomic war base of Japan can enable Japan's overproduced semiconductors to find sales channels. In fact, Japan's military industry has already made great progress in recent years, and jet aircraft, artillery, tanks, destroyers, and submarines are being put into production on a large scale in a tense manner. The firepower of Japan's so-called "self-defense armed forces" has increased more than four times compared to the pre-war Japanese army. All of this shows that Japan is being dragged down the road of revival of militarism. If the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is signed, then Japan will be incorporated into the U.S. war track, and Japan will be led back to the road of war and aggression. This is already very obvious.

What consequences will the reactionary policies implemented by the Japanese monopoly group represented by Kishi Nobusuke lead to? The first direct victims are still the Japanese people. The reason is very clear, the development of Japan's military industry will inevitably lead to the decline of peaceful industries. Japan's unemployed population continues to increase, with no signs of decreasing. Once a large number of non-productive munitions manufacturing begins, the heavy burden of military expenditure will inevitably fall on the shoulders of the Japanese people. At the same time, in order to eliminate the obstacles on the road of arms expansion, war preparation, and foreign aggression, the Japanese monopoly group will inevitably further deprive the Japanese people of their democratic rights, revive the militarist dictatorial rule, and attack the Japanese people. The more serious problem is that, according to the revised Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," Japan will be led by the nose by the United States and become a U.S. military base for conducting nuclear war in the Far East and Asia. According to the news revealed in the negotiations between the Kishi Nobusuke government and the United States on the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the United States will use Japan as a military base, under the pretext of "ensuring the security of Japan or the Far East," to send its aggressive troops to any place the United States deems necessary to go. Under this situation, Japan will not be able to avoid bearing the obligation for the U.S. war actions, and the Japanese people will inevitably become the victims of nuclear war. The Japanese people suffered heavy disasters in the previous war of aggression against China and the Pacific War. Now the Japanese people will once again be dragged into the abyss of nuclear war by U.S. imperialism. If the conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries succeeds, the Japanese people will inevitably bear consequences that are tens of millions of times more serious than the last war. This is something that the Japanese people absolutely cannot allow.

Being hostile to China and the Soviet Union is a consistent policy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, and their military alliance is of course aimed primarily at China and the Soviet Union. This has already been admitted in Fujiyama's speech on November 16. However, in the face of the powerful Soviet Union and the powerful China, the Japanese reactionaries cannot but consider what consequences will result from infringing on China and the Soviet Union. Past historical experience has also told us that the aggression and expansion of all militarists often first point the finger at places they consider to be relatively weak. In fact, the Japanese monopoly group has always coveted the rich resources of Southeast Asian countries, and has recently made no secret of its ambition to carry out economic, political, and military expansion in Southeast Asian countries. This year, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also formulated a long-term economic expansion plan called "New Economic Diplomacy," the central content of which is to adopt a combination of "compensation" and "economic assistance" to realize "agricultural Southeast Asia, industrial Japan." Japan, in collusion with the United States, is actively dumping surplus industrial products in Southeast Asian countries and plundering the resources of these countries. Recently, Japan has also sent a large number of military personnel to help South Vietnam establish and expand naval bases, and has also established arsenals for South Vietnam. Japan is manufacturing military aircraft for the Philippines and sending air force personnel to the Philippines to carry out training work. These facts fully demonstrate that the spearhead of aggression of Japanese militarism is primarily aimed at Southeast Asian countries. However, the awakened people of Southeast Asian countries know how to safeguard their independence and sovereignty, and they will never allow Japanese monopoly capital to do whatever it wants.

It can be seen from this that the reactionary policy of the Japanese monopoly group represented by Kishi Nobusuke to carry out military collusion with the United States and revive militarism will not bring any benefits to Japan, but will only lead Japan to war and suffer greater disasters than the previous war. The broad Japanese people resolutely demand to take the road of independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality. This is Japan's only bright future. Therefore, the struggle of the Japanese people against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is expanding and deepening day by day. The Chinese people have always regarded U.S. imperialism as the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people, and have always given deep sympathy and support to the just struggle of the Japanese people. The Japanese people are facing the most ferocious enemy, and their struggle is very arduous. However, we firmly believe that the heroic Japanese people will surely break through all kinds of difficulties and achieve the final victory.

### 日本正在被拖上军国主义复活的道路

    日本正在被拖上军国主义复活的道路
    日本岸信介政府不顾广大日本人民的强烈反对，扬言明年1月中旬准备同美国签订新的日美“安全条约”，正式缔结侵略性的日美军事同盟。关于这个军事同盟的侵略性质，日本外务相藤山爱一郎前几天作了一次最露骨不过的供述。藤山在日本国会临时会议上公然叫嚷：新的日美“安全条约”所包括的地区将以日本为中心，包括菲律宾以北地区、中国沿海地区和苏联滨海的边疆地区等。藤山还特别强调，驻日美军的作战行动范围可以包括到中国和苏联的内地；并且公开承认，日本目前正在同美国谈判把包括核武器在内的重要装备运入日本的问题。
    藤山爱一郎的这番叫嚷，是美国和日本反动派进行军事勾结，复活日本军国主义，敌视中、苏，向东南亚扩张，在远东策划新的战争阴谋的大暴露。
    自从美国和岸信介政府开始酝酿修改日美“安全条约”的时候起，我们就屡次提出过警告，指出这一条约的侵略性质，以及它对中、苏，对东南亚各国，对远东和亚洲的和平和安全带来的威胁。但是，迄今以前，日本国内和其他国家还有一些人对这点不完全相信。现在，藤山爱一郎已经不打自招了。请看，美日反动派已经把所谓“安全”和“防卫”的范围，伸展到“菲律宾以北地区、中国沿海地区和苏联滨海的边疆地区”了。不仅如此，他们甚至把“安全”和“防卫”的范围，伸展到中国和苏联的内地来了。难道除了为了侵略和扩张的目的而外，还有任何旁的理由容许把自己的“防卫”范围伸展到别国的领土上去吗？其实，这类谬论对于我们来说，已经不是什么新鲜的玩意了。美国不是公开声称西太平洋是它的国防前线吗？当日本军国主义者在二十多年前发动侵华战争、后来发动太平洋战争的时候，不也宣布过中国、东亚和太平洋都是日本的生命线吗？所以，事情已经昭然若揭，对于将要修订的日美“安全条约”的侵略性质，是再也用不到有什么怀疑的了。
    将要签订的新的日美“安全条约”，并不是像美国所说的，“是一个两个平等的伙伴之间谈判的条约”，而是美帝国主义和以岸信介为代表的日本垄断资本集团主仆之间狼狈为奸、互相利用的产物。
    就美国而言，近几年来，美帝国主义的侵略扩张政策，在世界和平力量的打击下，遭到了不断的失败，从而使自己陷入越来越孤立的地位。美帝国主义为了摆脱它在政治上的孤立和在战略上捉襟见肘的窘境，正在放出和平的烟幕，装出和缓的姿态，企图用这种手法欺骗美国人民，麻痹世界人民反对帝国主义、争取和平的斗争意志，掩盖它加紧扩军备战的活动。在军事上，美帝国主义则采取缩减常规武器生产，集中力量发展导弹生产，扩大导弹基地，以及积极扶持西德和日本军国主义再起的办法，妄图恢复已经失去的军事优势，改善自己的战略地位。在美国帝国主义眼里，日本是它在东方进行侵略扩张、准备原子战争的最理想的工具。正因如此，美国在第二次大战后，始终不放松对日本的控制。美国也深知，美国对日本的占领引起日本人民的极大不满。为了欺骗日本人民，缓和日本人民的反美斗争，需要给日本披上独立的外衣。因此，美国亟欲通过签订新的日美“安全条约”，把日本装扮成美国的“平等的”伙伴，来加紧复活日本军国主义，企图进一步把日本绑在美国的战车上，使日本成为美国在远东进行侵略和扩张的原子基地和帮凶，为美国火中取栗。
    从日本的情况来看，日本的垄断资本集团走军国主义的道路，也是有着深刻的历史和社会根源的。日本原来就是一个靠军国主义起家的帝国主义国家。作为军国主义经济基础的日本垄断资本在战后不仅没有遭到摧毁，而且在美帝国主义的卵翼和扶持下，在朝鲜战争的刺激下，有了迅速的恢复和很大的发展。日本的工矿业生产，到今年8月为止，已经达到战前水平的二点七倍。在这种情况下，日本垄断资本的本性，决定它不是从发展和平生产和发展同亚非国家平等互利的贸易和经济关系，来解决它发展中的困难；而是从发展军事工业和向国外扩张来寻找出路。按照日本垄断资本的口味，只有走军国主义的道路，才能使军事工业大发其财，也只有走军国主义的道路，才能实现对外扩张，为他们打开国外市场。日本著名作家石川达三说得对：日本垄断资本所以亟图实现修改日美“安全条约”，就是因为日本在美国的支持下，大举复活军国主义，就可以使日本的钢铁工业和化学工业能够大赚其钱，而核武器的运进日本和日本的原子战争基地化，就可以使日本生产过剩的半导体能够找到销路。事实上，近几年来日本的军事工业已经有了很大的发展，喷气式飞机、大炮、坦克、驱逐舰和潜水艇正在紧张地大量投入生产。日本的所谓“自卫武装”的火力，已经比战前日本陆军增强了四倍以上。所有这些，说明日本正在被拖上军国主义复活的道路。如果新的日美“安全条约”得以签订，那么，日本就将纳入美国的战争轨道，日本就会重新被引向战争和侵略的道路，这已经是再明显不过的了。
    以岸信介为代表的日本垄断集团所执行的反动政策，究竟会引起什么后果呢？首先直接的受害者还是日本人民。道理很明显，日本军事工业的发展必然带来和平工业的衰退。日本的失业人口还在继续增加，丝毫没有减少的迹象。大量非生产性的军火制造一旦开始，其沉重的军费负担必然落在日本人民的肩上。同时，日本垄断集团为了排除它在扩军备战和对外侵略的道路上的障碍，必然会进一步剥夺日本人民的民主权利，复活军国主义的独裁统治，向日本人民进攻。问题更严重的是，按照修改后的日美“安全条约”，日本将被美国牵住鼻子，成为美国在远东和亚洲进行核子战争的军事基地。根据岸信介政府同美国谈判修订日美“安全条约”中透露出来的消息，美国将利用日本这一军事基地，在“保障日本或远东的安全”的借口下，把它的侵略军队出动到美国认为需要去的任何地方。在这种形势下，日本将不可能不对美国的战争行动承担义务，日本人民将不可避免地成为核子战争的牺牲品。日本人民曾经在前一次侵华战争和太平洋战争中蒙受了惨重的灾难，现在日本人民又将再一次被美帝国主义带进核子战争的深渊。如果美日反动派的阴谋得逞的话，日本人民就必将承担比上一次战争惨重得千万倍的后果，这应该是日本人民所绝对不能容许的。
    以中苏为敌是美日反动派的一贯政策，他们的军事同盟当然以中苏为主要的目标，这一点在藤山11月16日的谈话中已经供认不讳。但是，在强大的苏联和强大的中国面前，日本反动派不能不考虑，侵犯中苏将会招致怎样的后果。过去的历史经验也告诉我们，一切军国主义者的侵略扩张，往往都是首先把矛头指向他们认为比较薄弱的地方。事实上，日本垄断集团一向垂涎东南亚各国的丰富资源，而且最近以来已经不隐讳它对东南亚各国进行经济、政治和军事扩张的野心。今年，日本外务省更拟订了一项所谓“新经济外交”的长期经济扩张计划，其中心内容就是要采取“赔偿”和“经济援助”相结合的手段，实现“农业东南亚、工业日本”。日本同美国相勾结，正在积极地向东南亚各国倾销剩余工业品，掠夺这些国家的资源。最近，日本还派了大批军人帮助南越建立和扩大海军基地，并且替南越建立兵工厂。日本正在为菲律宾制造军用飞机，并且派遣空军人员去菲律宾担任训练工作。这些事实充分说明，日本军国主义的侵略矛头，首先是对着东南亚各国的。但是，已经觉醒了的东南亚各国人民是懂得如何维护他们的独立和主权的，他们决不会让日本垄断资本为所欲为。
    由此可见，以岸信介为代表的日本垄断集团，同美国实行军事勾结，复活军国主义的反动政策，决不会给日本带来任何好处，而只能把日本引向战争和遭受比前一次战争更大的灾难。广大的日本人民坚决要求走独立、民主、和平、中立的道路，这是日本唯一光明的前途。因此，日本人民为反对修改日美“安全条约”而进行的斗争，正在一天比一天扩大和深入。中国人民一向认为美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人，对于日本人民的正义斗争一贯给予深切的同情和支持。日本人民面对着最凶恶的敌人，他们的斗争是十分艰巨的。但是，我们坚信英勇的日本人民一定能够突破重重的困难，取得最后的胜利。
