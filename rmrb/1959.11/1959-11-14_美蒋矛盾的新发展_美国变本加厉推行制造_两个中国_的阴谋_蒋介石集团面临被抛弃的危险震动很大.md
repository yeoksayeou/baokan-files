Xinhua News Agency, November 13th - The contradiction between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique has recently experienced new developments. The intensified efforts by the United States to create "two Chinas" have further threatened the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan with abandonment, causing significant upheaval.

This new offensive by the United States to create "two Chinas" and prepare to abandon the Chiang Kai-shek clique began with the adjudication of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's request for the extradition of two Chiang Kai-shek Air Force officers. In 1953, two Chiang Kai-shek Air Force lieutenants, who were being trained in the United States, announced their betrayal of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and refused to return to Taiwan. They were sheltered by the United States and worked there. For several years, the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "embassy" in the United States repeatedly requested these two men from the US side, but the United States ignored them. On October 6th of this year, the US Federal Court suddenly brought up this long-shelved case and used it to make a big fuss. In its ruling rejecting the return of the two officers to Taiwan, the US Federal Court stated that "Taiwan is not a country; Taiwan can be said to be a territory or region occupied and governed by the Republic of China, but it has not been formally recognized as part of the Republic of China." It added that US immigration law only allows people to be sent to "a country." It is noteworthy that US Federal Court Judge Alexander Holtzoff repeatedly emphasized that this ruling was based on the US State Department's opinion on the status of Taiwan. On October 8th, US State Department spokesman Lipp issued a statement saying that this matter did not affect the US policy towards the Chiang Kai-shek clique, but on the other hand, it affirmed that the US Federal Court's "interpretation of the State Department's attitude (on the status of Taiwan) is correct."

Just as the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan were greatly shaken by this incident and issued a series of outcries, US President Eisenhower, at a press conference on October 22nd, made remarks attempting to deny that the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair. He even said that more than forty countries "recognize Formosa (referring to Taiwan) as independent." This statement by Eisenhower caused even greater uproar in Taiwanese newspapers. They believed that this talk of "Formosan independence" was by no means a "slip of the tongue" but precisely reflected Eisenhower's intention to create "two Chinas."

We can also cite recent remarks by some US congressmen. On October 29th, US Democratic Congressman Porter delivered a speech at the World Trade Association of the US Chamber of Commerce, advocating for the "internationalization of Formosa and the coastal Penghu Islands," the "dissolution of Chiang Kai-shek's army," and "putting Chiang Kai-shek himself in an old soldiers' home surrounded by barbed wire."

The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee then released a report on October 31st prepared by the California-based "Conlon Corporation" at the committee's request. This report, reflecting the views of some individuals within the US ruling group, openly proposed the "establishment of a Republic of Formosa" in Taiwan and placing it directly under the "protection" of US military force. The report also criticized the Taiwan Kuomintang for having "little appeal to the public" and described Chiang Kai-shek and others as a group of "exhausted people."

In the American bourgeois press, a large number of fallacies advocating "trusteeship of Taiwan" and "Taiwan independence" have also recently emerged. The "New York Post" advocated that the United States "embark on a new Asian policy based on the concept of UN trusteeship of Formosa." The "Washington Post and Times Herald" stated that the logic of recognizing the existence of two Germanys "should also apply to two Chinas, or to an independent Formosa." This newspaper also published an article that extensively promoted the differences between "Formosans" and "mainlanders" who fled to Taiwan in order to create a basis for Taiwan's "independence." The article said, "In the long run, this island is best independent under the protection of the United States or the United Nations."

Recently, the United States' sinister intentions have become more exposed, causing great shock to the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan. After the US Federal Court falsely claimed that "Taiwan is not part of China" and Eisenhower declared so-called "Formosan independence," the Chiang Kai-shek clique immediately demanded clarification from the United States. However, the United States has been playing diplomatic games, refusing to give a direct answer. In response to the US State Department and the Federal Court's fallacy of "undetermined legal status of Taiwan," a spokesman for the Chiang Kai-shek clique stated on October 16th that "Taiwan has no so-called legal status issue since its return to China in 1945." The Taiwan Kuomintang authorities also used the opportunity of the "Taiwan Retrocession Day" on October 25th to emphasize "the inseparable relationship between Taiwan and the mainland" and mobilized the Taiwanese newspapers to refute Eisenhower's assertion of "Formosan independence." The "Taiwan Shin Sheng Daily News," the Taiwan Provincial Government's newspaper of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, published an editorial stating that the Chiang Kai-shek clique "cannot but suspect" that US officials "are reserving ground for their currently still unavowed intentions out of certain political motives," thus "deliberately creating erroneous concepts and confusing impressions" regarding the so-called legal status of Taiwan "to facilitate the implementation of their hidden intentions." The "Central Daily News," the Taiwan Kuomintang's official newspaper, pointed out that the concept of "two Chinas" is "nothing more than the first step in a conspiracy to eliminate the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek clique)." Other Taiwanese newspapers also launched fierce counterattacks against the United States.

    美蒋矛盾的新发展
    美国变本加厉推行制造“两个中国”的阴谋
    蒋介石集团面临被抛弃的危险震动很大
    新华社13日讯　美国和蒋介石集团之间的矛盾，最近又有新的发展。美国最近变本加厉推行的制造“两个中国”的阴谋，已使台湾国民党当局进一步面临被抛弃的威胁。
    这次美国发动制造“两个中国”和准备抛弃蒋介石集团的新攻势，是从裁决蒋介石集团要求引渡两名蒋介石空军军官的事件开端的。1953年，有两名在美国受训的蒋介石空军尉官宣布背叛蒋介石集团，不回台湾。他们受到美国包庇，在美国工作。几年来，蒋介石集团驻美国“大使馆”屡次向美方索取这两个人，美国都置之不理。今年10月6日，美国联邦法院突然把这件搁置多年的积案翻出来，利用它来大做文章。美国联邦法院在驳回把这两名军官送回台湾的裁决书上提出了“台湾不是一个国家；台湾可以说是为中华民国所占有并治理的领土或地区，但未经正式承认为中华民国的一部分”的理由。而美国的移民法是只允许把人送到“一个国家”去的。引人注意的是：美国联邦法院法官亚历山大·霍耳茨霍夫一再强调这是根据美国国务院关于台湾的地位的意见裁决的。10月8日，美国国务院发言人里普发表的声明一方面说，这件事并不影响美国对蒋介石集团的政策，但是另一方面又肯定美国联邦法院“对国务院
  （关于台湾地位问题的）态度的解释是正确的”。
    正当台湾国民党当局由于这一事件受到很大震动并发出一阵叫喊的时候，美国总统艾森豪威尔在10月22日的记者招待会上发表企图否认台湾问题是中国内政问题的言论，他竟说：已经有四十多个国家“承认福摩萨（指台湾）独立”。艾森豪威尔这一句话更引起了台湾报纸的喧哗。它们认为，这种“福摩萨独立”的说法绝非“一时失言”，而正是反映了艾森豪威尔心目中制造“两个中国”的打算。
    还可以举出美国一些国会议员最近的议论。10月29日，美国民主党众议员波特尔在美国商会世界贸易协会发表演说，主张“福摩萨和沿海的澎湖列岛国际化”、“解散蒋介石的军队”和“把蒋介石本人关在一个有铁丝网包围的老兵收容所中”。
    美国参议院外交委员会紧接着在10月31日发表了加利福尼亚州“康伦公司”应委员会要求而准备的一个报告。这份反映美国统治集团中某些人士的意见的报告公然提出在台湾“成立福摩萨共和国”，并且直接置于美国武力的“保护”之下。报告中还指责台湾国民党“对公众没有什么号召力”，蒋介石等是一批“精疲力竭的人”。
    在美国资产阶级报刊上最近也大量涌现出鼓吹“托管台湾”、“台湾独立”等谬论。“纽约邮报”主张美国“着手执行一种以联合国托管福摩萨的概念为基础的亚洲新政策”。“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”说什么承认两个德国的事实的逻辑“也应适用于两个中国，或者说适用于独立的福摩萨”。这家报纸还发表了一篇文章，大事宣传“福摩萨人”和逃到台湾的“大陆人”的不同，来为台湾“独立”制造根据。文章说，“从长远来讲，这个岛屿最好是在美国或联合国保护下独立”。
    最近美国这种心怀叵测的意图更加暴露，引起了台湾国民党当局很大的震动。当美国联邦法院妄言“台湾不是中国的一部分”和艾森豪威尔声言所谓“福摩萨独立”以后，蒋介石集团立即向美国要求澄清态度。而美国则一直玩弄外交词令，拒作正面答复。蒋介石集团发言人还针对美国国务院和联邦法院提出所谓“台湾法律地位未定”的谬论，在10月16日声明“台湾自1945年归还中国后，已无任何所谓台湾法律地位问题”。台湾国民党当局还利用10月25日台湾“光复节”的机会，着重强调“台湾与大陆有不可分离的关系”，并且动员台湾各报驳斥艾森豪威尔提出的“福摩萨独立”的说法。蒋介石集团台湾省政府机关报“台湾新生报”发表社论说，蒋介石集团“不能不怀疑”美国官方“出于某种的政治动机，为其目前尚不敢公开的企图预留地步”，因此在所谓台湾法律地位问题上“故意制造错误观念与混乱印象，以便利其隐秘企图之进行。”台湾国民党机关报“中央日报”指出，所谓“两个中国”的概念，“无非是要消灭中华民国（指蒋介石集团）阴谋的第一步”。台湾其他报纸也都对美国进行了激烈的反击。
