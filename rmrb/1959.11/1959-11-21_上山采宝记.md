Guizhou Plateau Reports a Bumper Harvest

    Record of Mountain Treasure Hunting

    At dawn, the mountaintops were still shrouded in heavy fog. A treasure-hunting army of ten thousand people from the Liuguang Commune in Xiuwen County marched towards the deep mountains and dense forests, accompanied by the sounds of gongs and drums.

    Team Leader Feng of the Xinyi Production Team led over a hundred commune members to a mountain head called Chalin. At this moment, the morning sun was just rising, and the forest sea was a riot of colors. The mountains were full of tung oil trees and oil tea trees, laden with fruit, some bending the branches. Hawthorns and *Quercus glandulifera*, red *Rubus corchorifolius* fruits and persimmons, as well as brownish-yellow Japanese Raisin Trees and walnuts, all competed with the blue sky and green leaves.

    The tung oil fruit pickers spread out from the mountaintop to the foot of the mountain. They used bamboo poles to knock down the tung fruits, while the women and older commune members picked them up under the trees. This year, the tung fruits grew exceptionally well; some tung trees yielded over a hundred fruits, surpassing the harvest of previous good years.

    The tea fruits on the oil tea trees were as numerous as the stars in the sky. One tree had at least a dozen catties of tea seeds. The Zhu Huaxuan oil tea picking team originally set quotas according to old rules, believing that they wouldn't pick much tea seed even after traversing an entire slope, so they only stipulated that each person should pick fifty catties of tea seed per day. Unexpectedly, this year's tea seed harvest was exceptionally abundant, and coupled with the team members' great enthusiasm, they averaged over one hundred catties per person in just one morning.

    Wild fruits are delicious, but picking them isn't so easy. Persimmon trees and Japanese Raisin Trees are two or three *zhang* tall, while chestnut and *Rubus pungens* trees are not very tall, but they have many thorns. But what does this mean to the young people? They planted a red flag on the hillside and nimbly climbed to the treetops, picking and harvesting in large quantities. Everyone sang happily: "The treasure-hunting army enters the mountain valley, the mountain's treasures smile happily, hearing that they support industrialization, they scramble to roll down the slope."

    What were a group of elderly people concentrating on finding on the hillside? It turned out that they were herbalists digging for medicinal herbs. The old herbalist Luo Zhengming pulled out a "Modong" with leaves like chives from the grass, and then dug up a "Guanzhong" that could treat hookworm disease. That morning alone, he dug up ninety-five catties of *Smilax glabra*, worth over six yuan.

    As dusk fell, people carried and carried on their backs, transporting the mountain's treasures down the mountain. At this time, in the commune's small autumn harvest command post, telephone bells rang incessantly, and various management areas reported the day's brilliant achievements. After a burst of rapid abacus calculations, the commander announced: Today, more than seventeen thousand eight hundred people went to work, collecting a total of one million five hundred and eleven thousand catties of various mountain goods and local specialties, worth more than one hundred thousand yuan, equivalent to 6% of the commune's total agricultural and sideline output value this year. Calculated based on the number of people working today, this money averages seven yuan, six jiao, and seven fen per person.

    贵州高原报丰收
    上山采宝记
    拂晓，山顶还罩着大雾，修文县六广公社的一支万人采宝大军，锣鼓喧天地向深山密林进发了。
    新义生产队的冯队长带着上百个社员，来到一个叫做茶林的山头。这时，朝阳初升，林海里万紫千红，五彩缤纷。满山的油桐、油茶，果实累累，有的把树桠都压弯了。黄里透红的山楂、青杠子，鲜红的红籽、柿子，还有褐黄色的拐枣、核桃等等，无不和蓝天、绿叶争奇斗艳。
    采桐子的队员们从山顶到山脚摆开了阵势。他们用竹竿把桐果打落，妇女和年纪大点的社员，便在树下捡起来。今年桐子长得特别好，有的一棵桐树能采到上百个桐子，胜过以往大年的收成。
    油茶树上的茶果简直比天上星星还多。一棵树起码有十几斤茶子。朱华轩这个摘油茶小组，原先按老规矩计定额，认为走遍一片坡还摘不到多少茶子，只规定每人一天摘五十斤茶子。不料今年茶子特大丰收，加之组员们干劲大，一个上午就平均每人摘一百多斤。
    野果虽鲜美可口，但采摘下来并不那么容易。柿树、拐枣树都有两三丈高，毛栗、红刺母树不大高，偏偏刺多。这对小伙子们来讲，又算得了什么？他们把红旗往坡上一插，轻捷地爬上树梢，大采大摘。大家高兴地唱道：采宝大军进山窝，深山百宝笑呵呵，听说支援工业化，争先恐后滚下坡。
    一群老年人在山坡上聚精会神地找些什么呢？原来是草药师们在挖药材。老药农罗正明一会儿在草丛里拔出一株叶子像韭菜一样的“墨冬”，一会儿又挖到一株能治钩虫病的“管仲”，那天上午，单是土茯苓，他就挖到九十五斤，价值六元多。
    暮色苍茫，挑的挑，背的背，把深山百宝押下山来。这时，公社的小秋收指挥部里，电话铃声不绝，各个管理区纷纷报告当天的辉煌战果。在一阵急促的算盘声后，指挥长宣布：今天出工一万七千八百多人，共采集各种山货土特产一百五十一万斤，价值十万多元，相当今年全社农副总产值的6％。这笔钱按今天出工人数计，每人平均七元六角七分。
