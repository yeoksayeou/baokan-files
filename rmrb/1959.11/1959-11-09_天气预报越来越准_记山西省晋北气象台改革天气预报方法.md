Weather Forecasts are Becoming More Accurate
    -- A Record of the Jinbei Meteorological Observatory in Shanxi Province Reforming Weather Forecasting Methods
    Creating Prefecture-Level Forecasting Methods
    The Jinbei Meteorological Observatory in Shanxi Province, after more than half a year of experimentation, has created a relatively complete set of prefecture-level forecasting methods.
    In the past, the Jinbei Meteorological Observatory simply used the weather map forecasting methods of larger stations, and therefore could not make county-level and regional forecasts for the prefecture. This lagged far behind the needs of the Great Leap Forward. To this end, they reformed the forecasting methods, adopting a new analysis and forecasting method centered on small weather maps, implementing "diversified operations, intensive cultivation, organic connection, and comprehensive application."
    The biggest advantage of the Jinbei Meteorological Observatory implementing this new analysis and forecasting method is that it has improved the accuracy of forecasts and better served agricultural production. From May to July this year, the average accuracy rate of 24-hour regional forecasts for the entire region reached 86.7%, and the accuracy rate of precipitation area forecasts reached 71.1%. Compared with the regional forecast accuracy rate from February to April before county-level and regional forecasting, the 24-hour forecast accuracy improved by 8%, and the precipitation forecast improved by 12.2%. Because it is necessary to understand the actual weather conditions of each meteorological (seasonal) station in the entire prefecture and listen to the opinions of observers at each station before forecasting, this is equivalent to conducting weather consultations with all stations in the region, following the mass line in forecasting methods. This not only improved the accuracy of regional forecasts, but also directly guided and promoted the improvement of the accuracy of supplementary forecasts at each meteorological (seasonal) station. According to the statistics of only eleven meteorological (seasonal) stations, in May and June after the county-level and regional forecast broadcast, the average accuracy rate of supplementary forecasts at each meteorological (seasonal) station in the entire prefecture was 32.7% higher than the average accuracy rate from January to April before the county-level and regional forecast.
    Because county-level and regional forecasts are more accurate, timely, detailed, and specific than in the past, weather forecasts have played a certain role in agricultural production throughout the region. For example, the timely and early sowing of 2 million mu of spring wheat in the entire prefecture this year, allowing the maturity period to avoid high temperatures and preventing root rot, resulting in an unprecedented bumper harvest, is greatly related to weather forecasts. During the all-out battle against potato late blight, because the meteorological observatory provided timely and accurate forecasts, the prefectural committee took effective measures to basically control the spread of the disease. The affected area of 2.58 million mu of potatoes in the entire region was only 5%, a decrease of 11.1% compared to last year. In coordinating pest control, the timely and relatively accurate forecasts provided by the meteorological observatory enabled the prefectural committee to take timely measures to eliminate armyworms and young locusts as soon as they appeared. In addition, it has also played a significant role in field management, pre-rain fertilization, utilization of flood irrigation, flood prevention, aerial surveys, and grain departments drying grain.
    After the implementation of this new analysis and forecasting method, nearly half of the manpower was saved, and the labor intensity of forecasters was reduced.
    Wholeheartedly Improving Forecast Accuracy
    The Jinbei Meteorological Observatory's reform of prefecture-level forecasting methods began to brew after the anti-Rightist movement last year. The anti-Rightist movement raised the ideological awareness of meteorological workers, and the Great Leap Forward promoted everyone's ideological liberation. In the past, due to the use of old forecasting methods, the accuracy rate of forecasts was not high, and forecasters felt distressed. Since the Guilin National Meteorological Conference in 1958 proposed the policy of "taking service to production as the key link and service to agriculture as the focus," they strengthened the perspective of serving production and the mass perspective. The most important thing is that the ideological awareness of meteorological workers has been raised, their enthusiasm has increased, and they all wholeheartedly want to change the situation of low forecast accuracy. In order to coordinate the all-out battle against potato late blight and early frost damage in the entire region, they successively sent mobile meteorological stations to provide on-site services. The result was: mobile stations had fewer people and fewer maps, but they forecast more accurately than prefecture-level stations with more people and more maps. In addition to playing a significant role in coordinating agricultural production, it also explored some preliminary experiences on how to improve forecast accuracy. This is the germination of the new forecasting method for prefecture-level stations. Leading comrades of the Central Meteorological Bureau inspected the station and gave specific instructions. From March this year, with the direct assistance of the Central and Provincial Meteorological Bureaus, they officially began experimental reform work. This new analysis and forecasting method after the reform more rationally utilized the coordinated role of large, medium, and small weather maps. It is based on the analysis and forecast of large stations and has initially achieved the combination of large-scale circulation situation evolution and specific local weather in this region, changing the ideological method of considering forecasts solely based on weather maps, expanding horizons, and achieving the combination of frequent observation of celestial phenomena and material phenomena with the analysis of weather maps; being able to initially grasp the general and special laws of weather in the entire region, basically achieving the combination of historical data statistical charts and current weather conditions; frequently consulting with experienced farmers on weather, collecting folk proverbs, carefully verifying them, absorbing their essence, thereby achieving the combination of mass experience and scientific analysis; comprehensively utilizing various charts and real-time data, referring to the supplementary forecasts of various county stations, from point to surface, and then from surface to point, initially achieving the combination of regional forecasts and single-station forecasts.
    Everyone Participates in Reform
    In the process of experimental reform, many difficulties and various conflicting ideas were encountered. For example, some people believed that small weather maps had few things and were not systematic, and could not analyze problems, so they doubted them and were unwilling to use them; regarding the combined use of indigenous forecasting methods, some forecasters felt that observing the sky and watching ants seemed to lower their status, so they dealt with it passively, and so on. Their reform experimental work finally achieved victory by constantly fighting against these ideas. Their main experiences are: leaders personally take action, follow the mass line, launch a large-scale mass movement. Calling on the entire station to mobilize, everyone contributes folk proverbs, everyone observes celestial phenomena and material phenomena, everyone participates in organizing data, and everyone makes forecasts. At the same time, mobilizing the masses to carry out free airing of views and debates, criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas such as emphasizing the major and neglecting the minor, emphasizing the foreign and neglecting the indigenous, and sticking to conventions. The director of the station and the branch secretary personally took the lead in using indigenous methods to observe celestial phenomena and material phenomena, participate in weather consultations, conduct specific guidance, and use various opportunities to publicize the superiority of small weather maps, etc. Through this series of work, a upsurge of everyone participating in the reform of prefecture-level forecasting work was formed.
    The Jinbei Meteorological Observatory's experimental reform work, under the leadership of the Party, has achieved certain results, but they believe it is only preliminary and there are still many shortcomings. They are continuing to work hard to further deepen the experimental reform work. They are determined to consolidate and improve on the existing basis, and to learn from all brother meteorological stations across the country in every possible way, in order to continuously improve their work and make greater achievements.

    天气预报越来越准
    ——记山西省晋北气象台改革天气预报方法
    创造专区台预报方法
    山西省晋北气象台经过半年多的试验，创造了一套比较完整的专区台预报方法。
    以往，晋北气象台只是沿用大台的天气图预报方法，因此不能做本专区的分县分片区域预报。这远远跟不上大跃进形势发展的需要。为此，他们对预报方法进行了改革，在采用大台大型天气分析预报广播的基础上，以小天气图为中心，实行了“多种经营，精耕细作，有机联系，综合运用”的新的分析预报方法。
    晋北气象台实行这种新的分析预报方法，最大的好处是提高了预报准确率，更好地为农业生产服务。今年5到7月，平均全区二十四小时区域预报准确率达到86.7％，降水区域预报准确率达到71.1％。这和分县分片预报前的2到4月的区域预报准确率比较，二十四小时预报提高了8％，降水预报提高了12.2％。由于在预报之先需要了解全专区各气象（候）站天气实况和倾听各站观测员的意见，这就等于和全区各站进行了天气会商，在预报方法上走了群众路线。这不仅提高了区域预报准确率，也直接指导和促使了各气象（候）站补充预报准确率的提高。仅据十一个气象（候）站的统计，分县分片预报广播后的5、6月，全专区各气象（候）站补充预报平均准确率就比分县分片预报前1到4月的平均准确率提高32.7％。
    由于分县分片预报比过去准确、及时、细致、具体，因此天气预报在全区农业生产中起了一定的作用。如今年全专区二百万亩春小麦适时提早播种，使成熟期躲过了高温，避免了烂根，获得了空前大丰收，这就和天气预报有很大关系。在大战马铃薯晚疫病期间，由于气象台提供了及时准确的预报，地委采取了有力措施，基本上控制了病害蔓延，全区二百五十八万亩马铃薯受灾面积只有5％，比去年减少11.1％。在配合防治虫害方面，也由于气象台及时提供了比较准确的预报，地委及时采取措施，使得粘虫和幼蝗刚一露头，就一举歼灭净尽。此外，对田间管理、雨前施肥、利用洪水灌溉、防汛、航测以及粮食部门晒粮食等方面，也都起到了显著的作用。
    这种新的分析预报方法实行以后，节省了近一半的人力，并且减轻了预报员的劳动强度。
    一心提高预报准确率
    晋北气象台进行专台预报方法的改革，是从去年反右派运动以后就开始酝酿了的。反右派运动提高了气象工作人员的思想觉悟，生产大跃进又促进了大家的思想大解放。过去，由于采用旧的预报方法，预报准确率不高，预报员都感到苦恼。从1958年桂林全国气象会议提出“以生产服务为纲，以农业服务为重点”的方针以后，他们加强了为生产服务的观点和群众观点。最主要的是气象工作人员思想觉悟提高了，干劲大了，都一心想改变预报准确率不高的局面。为了配合全区大战马铃薯晚疫病和早霜冻害，他们曾经先后派出流动气象台到现场服务。结果是：流动台人少图少，却比人多图多的专台预报得准。它除了在配合农业生产上起了显著作用以外，并摸索到了一些如何提高预报准确率的初步经验。这就是专区台新的预报工作方法的萌芽。中央气象局领导同志到这个台视察工作，又作了具体指示，从今年3月份，在中央和省气象局直接帮助下，他们正式开始了试验改革工作。改革后的这种新的分析预报方法，比较合理地发挥了大中小天气图的配合作用。它是在大台的分析预报的基础上，初步做到了大范围环流形势演变和本区局地具体天气结合，改变了单凭天气图考虑预报的思想方法，开扩了眼界，做到了经常观天象、物象与天气图的分析相结合；能够初步掌握全区天气的一般规律和特殊规律，基本上做到了历史资料统计图表和当前天气实况相结合；经常与老农会商天气，收集农谚，仔细验证，吸取其精华，从而做到群众经验和科学分析相结合；综合利用各种图表资料和实况，参考各县站的补充预报，从点到面，又从面到点，初步做到了区域预报和单站预报相结合。
    人人参加改革
    在试验改革过程中，曾经碰到了许多困难和各种各样的抵触思想。如有人认为小天气图上东西少，不系统，分析不出问题，因而对它发生怀疑，不愿使用它；对结合运用土法预报，有的预报员觉得观天、看蚂蚁等似乎降低了身份，因而消极应付，等等。他们的改革试验工作，就是通过不断地向这些思想作斗争而最后获得胜利的。他们的主要经验是：领导亲自动手，走群众路线，大搞群众运动。号召全台总动员，人人献农谚，人人观天象、看物象，人人参加整理资料，人人做预报。同时发动群众开展鸣放辩论，批判了重大轻小、重洋轻土、墨守成规等右倾保守思想。台长、支部书记亲自带头用土法观天象、物象、参加天气会商，进行具体指导，并且利用各种机会宣传小天气图的优越性等。经过这一系列的工作，形成了人人都参加改革专区台预报工作的热潮。
    晋北气象台的试验改革工作，在党的领导下，取得了一定成绩，但他们认为仅是初步的，并且还存在着不少缺点。他们正在继续努力，把试验改革工作再深入一步。他们决心在现有基础上巩固提高，并且要千方百计地从各个方面向全国各兄弟气象台学习，以不断改进工作，做出更大成绩。
