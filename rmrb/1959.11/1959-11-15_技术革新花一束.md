    A Bouquet of Technical Innovations
    The Native Expert Cheng Zhibang
    Cheng Zhibang, a worker at the Jieshou County Grain Depot in Anhui Province, is a daring and innovative individual. Over the past few years, he has invented and created 61 types of storage tools, essentially achieving indigenous mechanization of the Jieshou County granaries.
    In 1956, when the grain depot was dealing with insect-infested rice and sesame, four workers could only process 8,000 jin of grain per day, with an insect removal efficiency of only around 60%. The speed was slow, and the efficiency was low. He thought at the time, wouldn't it be much faster if we combined the sieve and the winnowing fan? After obtaining the leadership's approval, he began experimenting. One day, he was walking down the street and saw a cotton gin with a large wheel driving a small wheel, the belt spinning rapidly, which suddenly inspired him. After two days of experimentation, he successfully created a grain cleaning machine that combined sieving and winnowing. This machine could winnow and sieve 38,000 jin of grain per day, with an insect removal rate of 95%.
    Fifty-Five New Tools
    Wang Zhaolin, a technician in the No. 4 Workshop of the Hailar Meat Processing Plant in Inner Mongolia, came to this factory in 1955. In the past few years, he has successively improved, imitated, and created 55 pieces of equipment, including meat unloading machines, electric testicle crushers, and gearless electric saws.
    Take the bone meal machine, for example. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the factory began using cattle and sheep bones to make bone meal. At that time, bones were crushed manually, which was very laborious and produced a small quantity. Wang Zhaolin then remembered seeing mirabilite crushing machines in the Inner Mongolia Chemical Plant, and he thought that using a machine to crush bones would be faster and less strenuous. However, because it had been a long time, he couldn't remember the machine's design and principle clearly. So he explored on his own and studied with the masses, finally creating a centrifugal bone meal machine. This machine could crush more than 16,300 jin of bone meal per day, increasing work efficiency by more than 160 times compared to manual labor.
    In recent years, his technical innovations have saved the country more than 300,000 yuan.
    Underground Tap Water Network
    Each workshop and kitchen of the Food Processing Factory of the Commerce Bureau of Jingyuan County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, uses a lot of water every day. During busy production times, getting water alone required seven or eight people. However, the factory only had one well in the backyard. After drawing five or six buckets continuously, the water would dry up, and it would take more than 20 minutes to continue drawing water. This intermittent supply could not meet the demand and affected production.
    This matter caught the attention of Ma Shenglin, a young Hui worker. He often went to the well to observe. He found that the water source was abundant. Calculating that the well replenished five or six buckets of water in just over 20 minutes, it could supply the factory with more than 100 buckets of water in eight hours a day, which was sufficient. So why couldn't the demand be met? He pondered for a long time and finally understood: the well water stopped replenishing once it reached a certain level. Therefore, he thought, if the water was allowed to flow out continuously, it would be completely sufficient. He observed the terrain of the factory and found that the backyard was eight or nine feet higher than the front yard. He thought, if he drilled a hole from the bottom of the well, connected a pipe, and let it flow to the front yard, wouldn't the water flow continuously?
    His suggestion received the support of the leadership. He led two workers along the terrain, opening an underground waterway from high to low. In the middle, they built a reservoir four times larger than the water well's storage capacity and connected it to the tofu workshop, sauce garden, vinegar workshop, starch, alcohol, and sugar production workshops, and the kitchen with rubber hoses. In a few days, this indigenous tap water network, which almost ran through the entire factory, was completed, and clear water flowed continuously to each workshop.
    Clever Tailor Wang Hongniu
    Wang Hongniu of the Baoji City Sewing Cooperative Factory in Shaanxi Province is known as a "clever tailor."
    Wang Hongniu understands that using materials rationally when tailoring clothes can save the country materials and reduce costs for consumers, which is a win-win situation. Therefore, he painstakingly researched and created a set of "rational and compact material layout methods." Using this method, a piece of gabardine fabric measuring two feet five inches wide and one zhang two feet five inches long can be used to make a size three Zhongshan suit. The "rational and compact material layout method" he created saves two feet five inches of fabric per suit compared to the old tailoring method of "seven feet for trousers, eight feet for a jacket."
    After Wang Hongniu's advanced experience was promoted throughout the factory, the entire factory could save more than 260,000 feet of fabric per year. The saved fabric could be used to make more than 21,000 Zhongshan suits.

    技术革新花一束
    土专家程柱邦
    安徽省界首县粮食仓库工人程柱邦敢想敢干，大胆革新技术，几年来先后发明创造仓储工具六十一种，使界首县的粮仓基本上实现了土机械化。
    1956年，粮仓处理生虫的大米和芝麻，一天四个工人只能处理八千斤粮食，除虫效率只有60％上下，速度慢，效率低。他当时想，如果把筛子和风车做在一块儿，连筛带风不就快多了吗？经过领导同意以后，他就开始试制。一天，他走在街上，看见弹花机大轮带小轮，皮带转得飞快，一下启发了他。回去经过两天试制，一架连筛带风的净粮机就成功了。这部机器一天能风筛粮食三万八千斤，除虫率达到95％。
    五十五件新工具
    内蒙古海拉尔肉类联合加工厂第四车间技工王兆林是1955年来到这个厂的。几年来，他先后改进、仿造和创造了卸肉机、电动睾丸粉碎机、无齿轮电锯等五十五件。
    就拿骨粉机来说吧。在大跃进的1958年，这个厂开始利用牛羊骨头制骨粉。当时是用人工粉碎骨头，很吃力，生产数量又少。王兆林这时记起了曾在内蒙化工厂看到过芒硝粉碎机，想到用机器粉碎骨头，不是又快又省力？但是因为隔的时间久了，机器的样式、原理记不清了。于是他便自己摸索，和群众研究，终于制成一台离心式骨粉机。这部机器每天能粉碎出一万六千三百多斤骨粉，比人工提高工效一百六十多倍。
    几年来他在技术革新方面，共为国家节约三十多万元。
    地下自来水网
    宁夏回族自治区泾源县商业局食品加工厂各车间和厨房，每天都要用很多水，生产忙的时候，光打水就得七、八个人。可是，厂里只有后院一眼井，连续打上五、六担，水就涸了，要等二十多分钟才能继续打。这样，断断续续，供不应求，影响生产。
    这件事，引起回族青年工人马生林的注意，他常到井边观察。他发现，水源很充足，按二十多分钟就泉五、六担水计算，一天八小时，供应厂里一百多担水，是够用的。那么为甚么供不应求呢？他琢磨了很久，终于明白了：井水泉到一定水位，就不继续泉了。因此他想：如果让水一直不停地往外泉，就完全够用了。他观察了厂内的地势，发现后院比前院高八、九尺，他想：从井底打个眼，扯上管子，流到前院，水不就源源不断了么？
    他的意见得到领导的支持。他带着两名工人，顺着地势，由高而低开了一条地下水道，中途修了一个比水井蓄水量大四倍的蓄水池，用胶皮管接到豆腐房、酱园、醋房、淀粉、酒精、制糖等车间和厨房。几天，这个几乎贯穿全厂的土法自来水网就建成了，澄清的水源源流向各车间。
    巧裁缝王宏牛
    陕西省宝鸡市缝纫合作工厂王宏牛，被人称为“巧裁缝”。
    王宏牛懂得，裁衣服合理用料，既能为国家节约物资，又能使消费者减少费用，是一举两得的事。因此，他苦心钻研创造了一套“合理紧密排料法”。用这个方法，宽二尺五分、长一丈二尺五寸的华达呢布料，能作一套三号中山服。他创造的这个“合理紧密排料法”，比“七尺裤子、八尺袄”的老裁剪法，每套要节约二尺五寸布。
    王宏牛的先进经验在全厂推广后，全厂一年可以节约二十六万多尺布，节约的布可以做成中山服二万一千多套。
