The first batch of advanced cameras in our country, the "Chenguang" (Morning Light) brand cameras, have been successfully trial-produced by the Tianjin Camera Factory.

The specifications of this camera are a single-lens pentaprism reflex camera. During shooting, light enters through the lens, reflects through the pentaprism, so that the size of the photographed object and the visual situation are exactly the same, thus ensuring consistency between the viewfinder range and the shooting range. The relative aperture of the camera lens is 1:1.4, which is the largest aperture among domestic camera products. This camera can automatically focus on distance and has automatic shooting, coupled flash, and exposure meter devices. Shutter speeds range from one second to one five-hundredth of a second. This camera is suitable for use in industry, scientific research, national defense, medicine, news photography, and other fields.

    第一批高级照相机
    我国第一批高级照相机——晨光牌照相机，已由天津照相机制造厂试制成功。
    这种照相机的规格是单镜头五棱镜反光箱，拍摄时，光线从镜头进来，通过五棱镜反光，使拍摄物体大小和目视的情况完全相同，因而取景范围和拍摄范围取得一致。照相机的镜头相对口径为1∶1.4，是目前国内照相机产品中最大的口径。这种照相机能够自动对距离，并带有自动拍摄、连动闪光灯与曝光表的装置。快门速度从一秒到一千五百分之一秒。这种照相机适合于工业、科学研究、国防、医药、新闻摄影等使用。
