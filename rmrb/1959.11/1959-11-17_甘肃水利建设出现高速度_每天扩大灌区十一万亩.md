Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 16th November: Gansu has achieved an initial major victory in its water conservancy construction campaign. By November 7th, 759,000 mu of new irrigated land had been created, over 1,720,000 mu of irrigated land had been renovated, the irrigated area had been expanded by 2,480,000 mu, and new soil and water conservation projects had been constructed, initially controlling soil erosion over an area of more than 11,700 square kilometers.

Gansu fully leveraged the superiority of the People's Communes in this year's water conservancy construction. Under the unified arrangement of the People's Communes, the Three Autumn tasks (autumn harvesting, plowing and planting) and water conservancy construction advanced side by side. In early November, the number of people engaged in water conservancy construction reached 2.5 million, creating an unprecedented high speed of expanding the irrigated area by an average of 114,000 mu per day. Because the People's Communes have a large population and strong resources, they can plan unified measures to eradicate drought and flood disasters. This year, 213 large and medium-sized key water conservancy projects have been started, including 118 key reservoir projects. Among them, three reservoirs have water storage capacities of over 100 million and 300 million cubic meters respectively. The Hongyashan Reservoir in Minqin County is a large reservoir with a storage capacity of more than 100 million cubic meters built on the edge of a large desert. The first and second phases of the project have now been completed, and the third phase will also be completed before and after the Spring Festival. At the same time, many places have also set up many construction site factories, promoting tool innovation in water conservancy construction. According to statistics from seven counties in the Dingxi area, the communes have established more than 400 factories at construction sites, and newly manufactured and modified 360,000 tools, greatly improving labor efficiency. The Yintao construction site has fully launched a high work efficiency campaign, which has increased labor efficiency several times. This has ensured the high speed progress of various projects.

Now, the people of Gansu are continuing to work hard, practically and cleverly on the basis of initial victory, and are striving to complete the annual water conservancy construction plan ahead of schedule and above quota. (Picture attached)

    甘肃水利建设出现高速度
    每天扩大灌区十一万亩
    新华社兰州16日电　甘肃兴修水利运动初战大捷。至11月7日，已新修水地七十五万九千亩、整修水地一百七十二万余亩，扩大灌溉面积二百四十八万亩，新修水土保持工程，初步可控制水土流失面积达一万一千七百多平方公里。
    甘肃今年兴修水利中充分发挥了人民公社的优越性。在人民公社统一安排下，三秋工作和兴修水利并肩挺进。11月上旬，投入水利建设的人数达二百五十万，创造了每天平均扩大灌溉面积十一万四千亩的空前高速度。由于人民公社人多力量大、资金雄厚，可以统一规划根治旱涝灾害。今年开工的大中型水利骨干工程已达二百一十三处，同时开工的重点水库工程就有一百一十八座。其中有三座水库蓄水都在一亿立方米和三亿立方米以上。民勤县红崖山水库是修建在大沙漠边沿的一座蓄水一亿多立方米的大型水库。现在第一、二期工程已经完成，第三期工程也将在春节前后全部竣工。同时，许多地方还办起许多工地工厂，促进了水利施工中的工具改革。据定西专区七县统计，各公社在工地已办厂四百多座，新制改制工具三十六万件，大大提高了劳动效率。引洮工地全面开展高工效运动，使劳动效率提高了几倍。保证了各项工程高速度的进行。
    现在，甘肃人民正在获得初胜的基础上，继续大干、实干加巧干，为提前超额完成全年兴修水利计划而奋斗。（附图片）
