Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 21st: Ignoring the firm opposition of the Japanese people, the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling party held a joint meeting today and decided that Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama will go to the United States from January 15th to 23rd next year to sign a new Japan-US "Security Treaty", to conclude a Japan-US military alliance aimed at China and the Soviet Union.

Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama explained at the meeting that this was decided after negotiations with the United States.

According to Kyodo News, in order to get the parliament to ratify this military alliance treaty, the Kishi Nobusuke government is also attempting to convene a regular session of the Diet in late January.

Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama's statements in the Diet these past few days clearly expose that the new Japan-US "Security Treaty" is aimed at antagonizing China and the Soviet Union, scheming to arm Japan with nuclear weapons, cooperating with the US to create tension in the Far East, and threatening the peace and security of the Far East. According to the "Asahi Shimbun", Article 6 of the new treaty stipulates: "US forces stationed in Japan shall use the land, sea, and air military bases within Japanese territory to maintain international peace and security in the Far East."

When Fujiyama explained the scope of the so-called "Far East" in the House of Representatives on the 10th, he said: "The scope of the Far East is the area north of the Philippines, the coast of China, and the coastal region of (Soviet) Primorsky Krai, etc., the areas surrounding Japan." When Fujiyama answered questions from Socialist Party member Tokuji Kameda in the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors on the 16th, he further said: "US forces stationed in Japan can be dispatched to areas outside the Far East." Kameda further asked, "Can US forces also be dispatched to the Chinese mainland or the Soviet Union?" In his reply, Fujiyama openly said, "When Japan itself is subjected to direct aggression, US forces will have no choice but to be dispatched."

Fujiyama also stated in the Diet when answering questions that the new treaty will allow Japanese troops to go abroad to fight, acting as accomplices in US aggression. Article 5 of the new treaty stipulates: "If either contracting party is subjected to armed attack in Japanese territory, action shall be taken to deal with the common danger." Fujiyama explained: "If US forces stationed in Japan are attacked, Japan must also retaliate." He also said, "When Japan is attacked, it is possible to pursue the enemy."

The new treaty also lays the groundwork for Japan's nuclear armament. According to Fujiyama, in the new treaty's provisions regarding "prior consultations" with Japan when the actions and "important equipment" of US forces stationed in Japan are changed, the so-called "important equipment" "of course includes nuclear weapons." He also said: "Negotiations are currently underway with the US side based on the premise of 'including nuclear weapons'."

The major aggressive conspiracies exposed by Fujiyama's explanation of the new Japan-US military treaty in the Diet have caused serious unease among the Japanese public. The Japanese people are preparing to hold the large-scale Eighth National Unified Action to oppose the revision of the Japan-US "Security Treaty" and demand the abolition of this treaty.

### 配合美国在远东制造紧张局势  藤山公然叫嚣以中苏为敌  岸政府决定明年一月签订新的日美“安全条约”

    配合美国在远东制造紧张局势
    藤山公然叫嚣以中苏为敌
    岸政府决定明年一月签订新的日美“安全条约”
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：不顾日本人民的坚决反对，日本岸信介政府和执政党今天举行联席会议，决定日本首相岸信介和外务相藤山爱一郎在明年1月15日至23日到美国签订新的日美“安全条约”，来缔结矛头针对中国和苏联的日美军事同盟。
    外务相藤山爱一郎在会上说明，这是同美国方面谈判后决定的。
    据共同社透露，为了使国会批准这个军事同盟条约，岸信介政府还企图在1月下旬召开国会平时会议。
    日本外务相藤山爱一郎这几天在国会里的发言，清楚地暴露了新的日美“安全条约”是以中苏为敌，阴谋用核武器武装日本，配合美国在远东制造紧张局势，威胁远东的和平和安全。据“朝日新闻”透露，新条约的第六条规定：“驻日美军为了维持远东的国际和平与安全，使用日本领土内的陆海空军事基地”。
    藤山10日在国会众议院解释所谓“远东”的范围时说：“远东的范围是，菲律宾以北、中国的沿岸、（苏联）滨海边区等日本周围地区”。藤山于16日在参议院预算委员会上答复社会党议员龟田得治的质询时还进一步说：“驻日美军可以出动到远东以外的地区”。龟田进一步追问，“美军是否也可以出动到中国的内地或苏联呢？”藤山在答复中公然说，“在日本本身受到直接侵略的时候，美军就不得不出动。”
    藤山在国会答复质询时还表明，新条约将使日本军队出国作战，充当美国侵略的走卒。新条约第五条规定：“在日本领土上，缔约国任何一方遭到武力攻击时，要采取行动应付共同的危险”。藤山解释说：“如果驻日美军遭致攻击，日本也要还击”。他还说，“日本遭到进攻时，有可能追赶敌人”。
    新条约也为日本核武装埋下了伏笔。据藤山说，新条约关于驻日美军的行动和“重要装备”改变时要同日本进行“事先协商”的规定中，所谓“重要装备”“当然包括核武器在内”。他并说：“目前正根据‘包括在内’的前提同美方进行着谈判”。
    藤山在国会对新的日美军事条约的解释所暴露出来的重大侵略阴谋，引起了日本公众的严重不安。日本人民正在准备举行规模巨大的第八次全国统一行动，反对修改日美“安全条约”并且要求废除这项条约。
