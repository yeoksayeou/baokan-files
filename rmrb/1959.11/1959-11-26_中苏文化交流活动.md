Sino-Soviet Cultural Exchange Activities

Chinese Folk Tale Adapted for Ballet Stage

The ballet "The Flower of Happiness," adapted from a Chinese folk tale, was performed on the 11th by the Glinka Opera and Ballet Theater in Chelyabinsk.

The ballet was rehearsed by the theater to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the forty-second anniversary of the October Revolution.

The plot of the ballet is roughly as follows: A vicious emperor uses sorcery to detect those among the people who resist him and persecutes them cruelly. A heroic blacksmith among the people, with the help of treasures, arms the people and overthrows the tyrant's rule.

During the rehearsal process, Soviet ballet dancers enthusiastically learned basic Chinese dance movements, studied Chinese folk art and Chinese history to enhance their understanding of China.

The music for the ballet was composed by Muschel, a composer from Tashkent. The Leningrad and Tashkent Ballet Theaters are also preparing to stage the show.

Soviet Scholars Discuss Ancient Chinese Masterpiece "Guanzi"

Soviet Professor Shtein, a renowned scholar, recently published a book discussing the ancient Chinese masterpiece "Guanzi."

The author elaborates in detail on the content of the book, especially the parts related to economics. In studying "Guanzi," Shtein compared it with ancient Greek and ancient Indian economic thought.

The author said in his book that the emergence of such an outstanding work as "Guanzi" in ancient China allows us to draw the conclusion that at that time, China surpassed many ancient countries in terms of the forms of production relations. He believes that from the progressiveness of the social thought embodied in this book, there existed advanced production relations in China at that time. China was clearly ahead of Europe in the transition from slave society to feudal society.

Moscow Hosts Chinese Children's Doll Exhibition

Not long ago, a Chinese Children's Doll Exhibition was held at the Cultural Palace of the Labor Reserve in Moscow. The exhibition was widely praised by all sectors of Soviet society. Many teachers and parents believe that the exhibited dolls are very helpful in cultivating students' aesthetic feelings and enhancing their imagination abilities. These toys are very interesting and attractive.

The commentator of "Teacher's Newspaper," Aleksandrova, published an article in the newspaper saying that when you visit this exhibition, these porcelain dolls and cloth dolls will evoke a kind of cordial feeling in you. Standing among them, you will feel as if you are standing among real Chinese children, and they easily remind you of the elementary school students in your class.

Many Soviet children who visited the exhibition were very fond of the exhibited dolls.

    中苏文化交流活动
    中国民间传说搬上芭蕾舞台
    根据中国民间传说改编的芭蕾舞剧“幸福之花”11日由车里雅宾斯克的格林卡歌剧和芭蕾舞剧院演出。
    这个舞剧是剧院为庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年和庆祝十月革命四十二周年而排练的。
    舞剧的情节大致是这样的：有一个凶恶的皇帝借用妖术来侦察老百姓中反抗他的人，对他们进行残酷的迫害。人民中一个英勇的铁匠，得到宝物的帮助，武装起人民推翻了这个暴君的统治。
    在排练过程中，苏联芭蕾舞演员们热情地学习了中国舞蹈基本动作、研究了中国民间文艺和中国历史，以增强对中国的了解。
    舞剧音乐由塔什干作曲家穆谢尔编写。列宁格勒和塔什干芭蕾舞剧院都准备排演这个剧目。
    苏联学者论述中国古代巨著“管子”
    苏联著名学者什捷因教授最近发表了一部论述中国古代巨著“管子”的著作。
    作者详尽地阐述了这部书的内容，特别是其中有关经济的部分。在研究“管子”时，什捷因把它和古希腊和古印度的经济思潮作了比较。
    作者在他的著作中说，在中国古代出现像“管子”这样的出色作品，使我们有可能作出这样的结论：当时，中国在生产关系的形式上超过了许多古代国家。他认为从这部著作所体现的社会思潮的进步性来看，当时在中国存在着先进的生产关系。在从奴隶社会向封建社会过渡的时期上，中国显然比欧洲为早。
    莫斯科举办中国儿童玩偶展览会
    不久前，在莫斯科劳动后备队文化之家举办了中国儿童玩偶展览会。这个展览会受到苏联各界的普遍称赞。许多教师和家长都认为，展出的玩偶对培养学生美的感受、增强他们的幻想能力有很大帮助，这些玩具都很有趣、很吸引人。
    “教师报”的评论员亚力山德罗娃在报上发表文章说，当你参观这个展览会的时候，这些瓷娃娃和布娃娃会引起你一种亲切的感情。站在它们中间，你会感到自己好像是站在真正的中国孩子们中间一样，它们很容易使你联想起自己班上的小学生来。
    参观展览会的许多苏联小朋友都非常喜欢展出的玩偶。
