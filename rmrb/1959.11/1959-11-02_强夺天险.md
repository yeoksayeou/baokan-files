Bright and shining lights, accompanying the rhythmic roar of machinery, the soaring sound waves of the dispatch room, the commanders directing the hydro-power team. Work clothes stained with oil, yet still the demeanor of revolutionary soldiers! Twenty years of battles in the north and south, twice seizing natural barriers, forcefully attacking the Yellow River. Back then, following the army south from the north, welcoming the swirling artillery fire, standing at the bow of the boat commanding the team, cutting a path forward on the waves of the Yellow River. Fresh blood dyed the rolling waves red, leading the soldiers to conquer the natural barrier in one fell swoop, Chiang's bandit soldiers were defeated like a landslide, pursuing the victory all the way to the Wuzhi Mountain peaks. Now going north again from the south, raising the lights of construction on the Sanmenxia, commanding a new army, forcing the age-old scourge of the Yellow River to surrender its wealth. Cutting down cliffs, severing raging currents, leading workers to build iron and steel roads! The dam across the river cuts off the natural barrier, forcing the Yellow River to flow at our command. From artillery fire to electric lights, seizing the natural barrier again and again, the Yellow River is so beautiful now, from the heroic waves will spring forth the flowers of hydropower.

    强夺天险
    吴烟痕明亮明亮的灯火，伴随那机器轰响的节奏，调度室的声浪飞腾，指挥员在指挥水电队伍。工作服上沾满油污，依然是革命军人的风度！南征北战二十年，两夺天险，强攻黄河。当年随军由北南下，迎接那纷飞的炮火，立在船头把团队指挥，黄河浪涛上杀出前进的道路。鲜血染红滚滚大波，率领战士把天险一举攻破，蒋匪兵败如山倒，乘胜追击直到五指山头。如今由南又向北去，三门峡上高举建设的灯火，指挥一支新的大军，逼令万年祸水交出财富。砍平峭壁，斩断狂流，率领工人筑起钢铁的道路！拦河大坝横截天险，迫使黄水在我们手中奔流。从炮火战斗到灯火，强夺天险再把天险强夺，目下的黄河如此多娇，雄浪中将涌出水电的花朵。
