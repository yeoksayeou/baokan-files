Soviet Newspapers Should Be the Strongest and Most Combative
Khrushchev's Speech at a Meeting with Soviet Journalists in the Kremlin on November 14
Comrades!
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in its congratulatory message to the First Congress of Soviet Journalists, expressed its respect and gratitude for the work of us journalists. Originally, this could have expressed all I wanted to say: everyone has heard and read the congratulatory message from the Party Central Committee. If you want me to say a few more words, then on behalf of the Central Committee, I once again congratulate you on the success of the Congress and on the establishment of the Soviet Journalists Association. (Stormy applause) I also congratulate you on the election of the council and other leading bodies of the Journalists Association. If I say that the Congress is over and it is time to start working, then it seems as if you were doing nothing before and are only starting to work now. However, this is absolutely not in accordance with the facts. Before and during the Congress, journalists were working very well.

The achievements of the Soviet Party and people rejoice the entire progressive humanity and terrify the parasites.

Comrades! The party of communists founded by Lenin has traveled a great road and opened up such a channel in life that, as the saying goes, even a blind person cannot fail to see it. The achievements of our Party and the Soviet people rejoice everyone, not only the Communists, but also the entire progressive humanity in the world. I want to say, rejoice all those who hope to build a life where everyone is a real person, and their work is for themselves, for society, and not for parasites. The activities of our Party, the labor of our workers, peasants, and intellectuals are examples of the struggle to build such a life. The achievements made by our people under the leadership of the Party have amazed everyone in the world and terrified the parasites. (Stormy applause)

In our socialist country, a very good division of labor has been formed. Everyone does their duty well in their own position. Just as bees work diligently from morning till night to build a complete hive and fill it with honey, our people, no matter where they work, as long as they are working honestly, are fulfilling their obligations and fulfilling their social responsibilities. As a result, we have a beautiful building built by the Soviet people on a socialist basis, and we are now successfully building communism! (Stormy applause)

Comrades! Now, everywhere in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, there is a scene of particularly great upsurge. Even those of us who are participating in this construction are sometimes surprised—you can look around and think about where all this came from, where this great possibility came from! I can't help but tell you about the very strong impression left on me by the achievements of the laborers of Ryazan. This province, which was economically backward last year, suddenly promised to increase meat production by 2.8 times this year compared to last year. This is no joke—an increase of 2.8 times in one year! Of course, figures can be put forward, and then, like the Gypsies used to do, renege on the promise and slip away. (Laughter in the hall) But the people of Ryazan are not planning to escape anywhere. They made a promise and are successfully fulfilling it. Very good, comrades! (Stormy applause)

The people of Ryazan are already tasting the pleasant and honorable taste of glory that will be obtained by fulfilling the guarantees undertaken. And it is not just Ryazan! Look at other republics and provinces. In our country, people can find extraordinary undertakings everywhere and are establishing their labor merits, making their contributions to communist construction! (Stormy applause)

Marxists are forever opposed to predatory wars, but they are not afraid of war. If the ruling class imposes war on the people, the Communists will accept the battle and strive to direct its spearhead at the ruling class, so that it benefits the working people.

Comrades! The relaxation that has appeared in international relations now seems to continue to develop. In the West, some say that the Soviet Union has changed its policies, so it is easier to deal with us. This is of course incorrect. We were born as Communists, we live as Communists, and we will not die, and we will continue to move forward as Communists in the future! (Stormy applause, shouts: "Glory to the Communists!" "Long live our Party!")

Some also say that the Soviet Union only put forward the slogan of coexistence now. This is also incorrect. This slogan was put forward by Lenin, and we are proud that the great Lenin—the leader of communism—put forward this slogan! (Stormy applause) Some people have not recognized the slogan of peaceful coexistence for forty-two years, and now even bourgeois politicians are beginning to recognize it. It seems that they have become smarter! We are proud that we have been and are doing as Lenin taught us, who first put forward this slogan. (Stormy applause)

Why are bourgeois politicians starting to recognize the idea of peaceful coexistence? People say that existence determines consciousness. Some exaggerate and say: "Fighting determines consciousness." I want to say that both are right. (Cheers and applause in the hall) It turns out that in this "existence," "fighting" helped some people. In the end, they began to admit that they must coexist peacefully. (Applause) Otherwise, where will the capitalist countries move to? They want to move us away. Can you move us away?! We don't want to move away from our homeland; we are settled people. We don't want to move them away either. Why should we do that? There are people there too! The working people of capitalist countries also want to live a peaceful and good life; and for this life, we spare no effort. The people of capitalist countries are not our enemies, but our friends! As for the bellicose imperialist groups that hold supreme power in some countries, that is another matter. But, comrades, everyone knows that to eliminate bedbugs, you don't need to burn the house; to fight the imperialists, you don't need to fight the working people living in capitalist countries.

We Marxists are forever opposed to predatory wars, forever! But the Communists are not afraid of war. If the ruling class imposes war on the people, then the Communists will accept the battle and strive to direct its spearhead at the ruling class, so that it benefits the working class and the working people. (Stormy applause)

Why are the diehards now becoming smarter, and why do they understand this now? Constant dripping wears away the stone, and the truth can break through rocks and steel! Our Leninist truth has broken through the cornerstone of those stubborn people who oppose and do not recognize the socialist system. The most fanatical representative of the interests of the imperialist groups, the late Mr. Dulles, although he left an unpleasant memory, it must also be pointed out that in his later years, he also had new views on some things.

Comrades, some people ask me whether I read more articles by our Soviet journalists or by non-Soviet journalists. I want to say frankly that this question is not easy to answer. I think I read more things from bourgeois journalists. Don't be offended, this is in the interests of us all. (Lively) We must know well what is happening in the capitalist world, what is being talked about and written about the Soviet Union there. What is causing uneasiness in the capitalist world now? At present, no one there is saying that our seven-year plan will not be completed. Now the capitalists also admit that the seven-year plan can be completed. And this is precisely what makes them uneasy. However, we believe that the seven-year plan can not only be completed, but also overfulfilled. (Stormy applause)

Our workers, collective farmers, scientists, engineers, and technicians, with their world-shattering achievements, have forced the ruling groups in capitalist countries to recognize our achievements and the necessity of peaceful coexistence. Now, everyone sees that coexisting with capitalist countries are rapidly developing socialist countries. This is an undeniable and true fact. Lenin once said: In one or twenty years, then we will be invincible. We have survived for forty-two years, that is, two twenty years, and we have confirmed the correctness of Lenin's prediction.

The Soviet Union proposed a plan for complete disarmament because it realized its responsibility to do everything possible to safeguard and consolidate world peace. The Soviet Union has the most devastating weapons and can eliminate any aggressor from the face of the earth if they dare to invade.

Comrades! We are proud of our great Lenin, Leninism, and the achievements of our Soviet people through their labor. Now, the socialist forces have been established as unprecedentedly consolidated and unbreakable. The Soviet Union has put forward a plan for complete and thorough disarmament. We are willing to disarm sincerely. However, the imperialists should know that we put forward this proposal not because we are weak militarily, economically, or politically. No, we do this because we realize our responsibility to do everything possible to safeguard and consolidate world peace, and we realize that war will only bring disaster to the people of all countries. We hope that our people and the people of all countries will have peace. (Prolonged applause)

If we talk about our country's economic capabilities and the defense capabilities of the Soviet state, then it should be said that our military parade this year was the shortest, although the Soviet army has accumulated the most invincible strength this year. (Stormy applause)

A few years ago, I said that our country had manufactured intercontinental ballistic missiles. At that time, many people in capitalist countries said that Khrushchev was probably bluffing. Later, when our rockets were put into production, I said that we were mass-producing intercontinental rockets. They began to clamor again that this was impossible and that Khrushchev was bluffing again.

(Mikoyan: Let them bluff too!)

It is okay to bluff, but you must let the whole world see what you are bluffing about. We "bluff" like this: the whole world has seen our rocket fly to the moon and land on it! (Stormy, prolonged applause)

It can be seen that this is not bluffing. This is a real fact. Dear comrades, members of the presidium, I think I will not be revealing any secrets when I say the following—here I hope people can correctly understand my words: we do not want to intimidate anyone, but we can tell the truth—now we have so many rockets, so many atomic warheads, and hydrogen warheads, that if anyone dares to invade us, then we can eliminate all possible enemies that invade us from the face of the earth. (Prolonged applause)

When visiting a factory, we learned about the situation of workers, engineers, and scientists manufacturing rockets. During the visit, the emotions were contradictory. The most lethal and destructive weapons are produced here; on the other hand, we are also proud that we have such weapons. Some may say that Khrushchev is caught in a contradiction: he advocates peace and has won the Lenin Prize for Strengthening International Peace, but at the same time, he is proud of producing destructive weapons. The reason I am proud is because this weapon is in the hands of the most peace-loving country, in the hands of the Communist Party and our people who defend the cause of peace. This is a severe weapon against those who dare to launch a war. Therefore, it is a strong backing for defending peace.

However, our policy is not a policy of "strength." This year, we put forward a proposal for complete and thorough disarmament at the UN General Assembly. We are willing to destroy all rockets. By the way (let the foreigners know too, I don't hide it): this factory we visited has continuously produced two hundred and fifty rockets with hydrogen warheads a year. If converted into ordinary explosives, this is many millions of tons. You can imagine that if this destructive weapon explodes over a certain country, then nothing will be left there at all.

We have such powerful weapons to defend our motherland. Although we have these weapons, we declare that for the sake of world peace and for the future, we are willing to throw all these weapons into the sea so that all people—our generation and our descendants—can live in peace, and let them know that we not only do not want war, but also do not want to have weapons for combat. If other countries are willing to follow our example, we are willing to immediately destroy all these weapons. (Stormy applause)

Our things are going very well. Our country's economy is developing day by day. The power of the Soviet Union is increasing day by day. This is how life is! Comrades, isn't this a good life! (The audience cheered, stormy applause)

In the United States, those who oppose disarmament are still very powerful. If the imperialists insist on returning to the position of the "Cold War," they will end up with greater failure.

We are satisfied that our relations with other countries are now beginning to improve. You remember that at the beginning of this year, British Prime Minister Macmillan visited the Soviet Union. As the head of government, I and my comrades in the government had very beneficial talks with Mr. Macmillan. This meeting played a significant role in improving the current international situation. If we compare the talks we had with the British national leaders at the Geneva Summit in 1955 (when Mr. Macmillan was the Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister Eden) or the talks we had during our visit to London in 1956 with the meeting in Moscow, then it is very clear that the situation has changed. There has been progress in understanding the necessity of peaceful coexistence.

I have met with U.S. President Eisenhower three times. He came to Moscow in 1945, but I did not meet with him at that time. However, if we compare the talks we had with him and Mr. Dulles in Geneva in 1955 with the talks we had in Washington not long ago, then it should be said that the period between the two meetings was not long, but the progress in our relationship was not small. We feel that the President sincerely hopes to reach an agreement and achieve a relaxation of international tension. This is very gratifying! Of course, this is just our impression, and people's feelings are—a not very accurate measuring instrument; there may be a lot of subjective components here. However, we still hope that the desire to improve relations will soon have a concrete form.

During the talks in Washington, I said to Mr. Eisenhower that his situation is of course different from mine. I am fully authorized by the Soviet government and, based on the wishes of our people, can immediately sign an agreement on disarmament and on stopping the production and destruction of weapons. I think the President also wants to do this, but the reason why he has not been able to do so seems to be because those who oppose disarmament are still very powerful in the United States. We should not be deceived by this.

Yesterday I read Mr. Nelson Rockefeller's speech. I met with him in Geneva. Not long ago, I met with him again in New York. He said some good things and some bad things in his recent speech. This reflects that certain groups hope to reverse the pointer of the barometer. This pointer is now tending towards the relaxation of international tension, from "cloudy" to "sunny," while those who advocate the "Cold War" are turning it in the other direction. However, Mr. Imperialists, if you insist on returning to the position of the "Cold War," then Rockefeller cannot save you, just like Dulles cannot save you. You can prolong the "Cold War," but it will always end in a greater failure for those who oppose the relaxation of international tension. (Applause)

We will soon visit France and meet with President de Gaulle. We attach great importance to this visit. The Soviet government believes that we and France can reach mutual understanding. Our roads have never crossed each other anywhere. The Soviet economy is independent and is not based on the wealth of other countries. Therefore, there is no reason for any conflict or disagreement between our country and France. Of course, we have different attitudes on the German issue, but I think the formal differences are greater than the substantive differences, because the French are no more fond of the German revanchists than we are. President de Gaulle understands the danger of the revival of German revanchism. But, of course, there are still many complicated situations on the German issue that need to be considered. I think this visit to France will be beneficial, and it will help us achieve a better mutual understanding. But why guess the future? There is a Russian proverb: As long as you live, you will always see it.

Adenauer is not thinking about anything good now. The Soviet Union has not, does not, and will not recognize the rights of the Bonn revanchists to West Berlin.

Prime Minister Adenauer is not thinking about anything good now. I have not mentioned his name in my last two speeches, which journalists have noticed. But I have to mention him for the third time. (Cheers) Bonn has threatened to establish its own radio station in West Berlin. We believe that this attempt is illegal and a provocative act. The Bonn revanchists must want to provoke us to take sharp measures to retaliate. They hope we will help them re-intensify the "Cold War." However, gentlemen, if you go this route, then all that awaits you is failure, nothing else. We have not recognized, do not recognize, and will not recognize your rights to West Berlin. Please do not forget this, Mr. Bonn revanchists. (Applause)

In order not to complicate the situation, I did not want to express my opinion on the specific issues that may be discussed at the summit meeting. But I have to talk about it again, and it's not my fault. Others are making us do this. In this situation, we cannot and will not act according to this motto, which is: when someone slaps your left cheek, you have to turn your right cheek over. We will act like human beings: if someone slaps our left cheek, we will retaliate in the same way so that they will never think of doing this again. (Prolonged applause) We hope that the Bonn revanchists will restrain their fanaticism and hope that they will act like people who are not good at fighting. Let us better negotiate. Everyone knows that West Berlin does not belong to the Federal Republic of Germany but is located on the territory of the German Democratic Republic. (Stormy applause) May no one take this or that irrational action and decision to aggravate the situation in this region and other regions of the world. Irrational actions can only aggravate tensions and cannot resolve disputes.

Journalists are not only the Party's loyal assistants but also the Party's right-hand men—active fighters for the Party's great cause, like the most reliable conveyor belts, taking the Party's resolutions deeply into the people.

Dear journalist comrades! We call writers the Party's assistants. Please don't blame me if I say that you journalists are not only the loyal assistants of our Party but also simply the right-hand men of our Party—active fighters for the Party's great cause. (Stormy applause) Why are you the right-hand men? Because you are always on the Party's side. Whenever a resolution needs to be explained and implemented, we look for you, and you are like the most reliable transmission belts, taking the Party's resolutions deeply into our people. (Prolonged applause)

The strength of our Party lies in its inseparable link with the masses of the people. The strength of our newspapers, the source of its great influence, lies in the essence of what the newspapers bring to the masses. And the essence is our Party's Leninist policy, Lenin's ideas on building socialism and communism. It is easy to take on this burden because it is not heavy. (Stormy applause)

(V. A. Karpinsky: We are carrying this burden with full enthusiasm.)

Yes, we are all carrying this burden with full enthusiasm. This burden is not a heavy burden. You can't feel it is a burden. It encourages you, calls you, and leads you forward. (Stormy applause)

Comrades! You journalists are doing a good job. But don't be complacent. Don't think you have grabbed God's beard just because you have been praised. (Cheers) There are still many boring things in our newspapers. Sometimes you pick up the newspaper, flip through it, and put it aside. Afterwards, you can't remember what was published in this newspaper. I say this to prevent you from being complacent. Newspapers should be run reasonably and should not be prepared only on the day of typesetting. Real leaders should have foresight and should prepare what topics to prepare for which issue. He should not only be good at selecting topics but also at selecting capable people to process the topics into a delicious lunch so that people will want to lick the remaining taste on their fingers after eating it. (Applause)

Of course, our newspapers have grown immensely, and our journalists have also grown, but there is no end to perfection. Therefore, in the future, we must strive, strive, and strive again to make our newspapers the strongest and most combative newspapers. As for authenticity and ideology, I will not talk about it because our newspapers were, are, and will continue to be the most authentic and ideological newspapers in the world. (Stormy applause)

In the West, some people still like to divide the world into Western countries and Eastern countries; into so-called free world countries and so-called iron curtain countries. Here they think that the countries of the capitalist world are free countries. These people should ask their own conscience! When they insist that capitalist countries are free countries, they can be said to be shameless. According to them, socialist countries are not free countries, but the regime of the bloody dictator, the puppet of capitalists and feudal lords, Franco, is a free regime. If this is also called freedom, God knows how they understand freedom?!

They also call West Germany a "free country." But if prohibiting the activities of the Communist Party, persecuting progressive organizations, interrogating and suppressing advocates of peace and opponents of militarism and reactionaries are all understood as freedom, then how can there be no freedom?

In some capitalist countries, even the bourgeois concept of freedom has been abandoned. Why? Because some people feel that relying on "bourgeois freedom" to ensure the maintenance of the exploitation of the working class is no longer enough. Therefore, they now tear off their masks, revealing their true colors, exposing their dictatorship over workers and working people. If all this is called freedom, then, as the saying goes, may God save us from this "friend of freedom," we will deal with the enemies ourselves. (Lively in the hall)

The Soviet Union's seven-year plan will not only be completed but also overfulfilled. The Soviet Union proves to the world with facts that socialism and communism are not only the lofty ideals of mankind but also reality.

This is what I want to talk about the domestic and international situation. We should coexist peacefully with capitalist countries because the political and social systems of each country are the internal affairs of the people of each country. However, we are not staying behind tall walls, seeing nothing and knowing nothing. We do not interfere in other people's affairs, but we will safeguard the interests of the working people as in the past. We have supported and will continue to support the struggle of workers and all working people for their own rights and against capitalist exploitation, but we have not interfered in the internal affairs of other countries in the past and will not interfere in the future. The unity of the proletariat is our right, and it is the right of every honest worker. Those who have been freed from capitalist exploitation cannot be indifferent to the fate of their class brothers. (Applause) Our sympathy is on the side of the colonial people who are fighting against colonial slavery and for freedom and independence.

Dear comrades, I want to end my speech. On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the Presidium of the Central Committee, I once again express my sincere greetings to you. I wish you all the best in your work and life. I wish you a good life, a good mood, and smooth work.

When we came here, Kliment Yefremovich wanted me to talk about the fact that we are not now being tried by the court for political crimes. But I have talked about this more than once. Comrades, is this still a secret? (Someone shouted "Everyone knows." Applause)

All this does not mean that we should now relax our vigilance. This is an unwise idea. There is no social basis for class struggle and enemy activities in our country now, but as long as we live and live together with capitalist countries, the enemies of socialism have sent and will continue to send their spies here. Therefore, we should remain vigilant and counter the enemy's spies' conspiracies.

We are very satisfied with the current situation in our country. The Soviet state is thriving in terms of economy, culture, and scientific development. This gives us more powerful strength. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Presidium of the Central Committee are convinced that the seven-year plan for the development of the national economy will not only be completed but also overfulfilled. In 1960, we will transition to a seven-hour working day, and in 1964, we will begin to transition to a six-hour working day. (Stormy applause)

However, if our proposal for complete and thorough disarmament is adopted (we have not yet counted), I think we will be able to make half of our workers transition to a six-hour working day during this seven-year plan. This is what our government is considering, and this is what the people of the Soviet state yearn for. (Applause)

We Soviet people have a desire to live a better, richer, and more colorful life. We firmly believe in our own strength and our own potential. The task of comprehensively developing communist construction put forward by the 21st Congress of the Party is being successfully realized. As excellent experts—Leninists, we prove to the world with facts that socialism and communism—this is not only the lofty ideal of mankind but also reality. (Stormy applause)

Dear friends, we will continue to unswervingly fight for the victory of communism in the future! You journalists occupy a glorious position in this great cause carried out by our people—the builders of communism—under the leadership of the Party. (Stormy applause)

Long live our glorious Soviet people!
Long live our Leninist Communist Party!
Long live the literary workers—journalists—who are constantly fighting for the happiness of the people and for the construction of communism! (Stormy applause, shouting: "Hurrah!")

### 苏维埃报刊应当是最强有力的和最富有战斗性的  赫鲁晓夫11月14日在克里姆林宫接见苏联新闻工作者时的讲话

专栏：

    苏维埃报刊应当是最强有力的和最富有战斗性的
    赫鲁晓夫11月14日在克里姆林宫接见苏联新闻工作者时的讲话亲爱的同志们！
    苏联共产党中央委员会在给苏联新闻工作者第一届代表大会的贺词里对我们新闻工作者的劳动表示了敬意和谢忱。本来，这也就可以说尽我的意思了：所有的人都听到了、读到了党中央委员会的贺词。如果大家要我再讲几句话，那么我要代表中央委员会再次向您们祝贺代表大会的成功，祝贺苏联新闻工作者协会的成立。（暴风雨般的掌声）我同时祝贺您们选举了理事会和新闻工作者协会的其他一些领导机构。如果我说，代表大会闭幕了，是开始工作的时候了，那么，结果好像是你们以前无所事事，而只是现在才开始工作似的。可是，这与事实绝对不符。不论在代表大会前和在代表大会期间，新闻工作者是很好地工作着的。
    苏联党和人民的成就使全体进步人类欢欣鼓舞，使寄生虫们胆战心惊。
    同志们！列宁所创建的共产主义者的政党走过了伟大的道路，并且在生活中开辟了这样一条沟渠，正像俗话所说的，连瞎子也不能看不见它。我们党和苏联人民的成就使所有的人欢欣鼓舞，不仅使共产党人欢欣鼓舞，而且使世界上全体进步人类欢欣鼓舞，我要说，使所有这样的人欢欣鼓舞，这些人希望这样来建立生活，在这种生活中每个人都是真正的人，他的工作是为自己、为社会，而不是为寄生虫。我们的党的活动、我国工人、农民和知识分子的劳动就是为建立这种生活而斗争的范例。我国人民在党的领导下所取得的成就使世界上所有的人惊讶，而使寄生虫们胆战心惊。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    在我们社会主义国家内，形成了一种十分良好的劳动分工。每个人都在自己的岗位上很好地完成自己的职责。正像蜜蜂从早到晚辛勤劳动，建造完整的蜂房，给它们酿满蜜一样，我们的人不论在什么地方工作，只要是在诚实地劳动，都是在完成着自己的义务，履行着自己的社会职责。结果，我们有了一个苏联人在社会主义基础上建造起来的美好的大厦，而我们现在正顺利地建设着共产主义！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    同志们！现在，在苏联和其他社会主义国家处处都是一片特别巨大的高涨的景象。甚至我们这些参加这种建设的人有时也感到惊奇——你可以环顾四周并想一想，这一切都是从哪里来的，这种巨大的可能性是从哪里来的！我不禁要把梁赞劳动者的成就给我留下的十分强烈的印象告诉大家。这个去年在经济上落后的州忽然保证要在一年中将肉类的生产比去年增加二点八倍。这可不是开玩笑——在一年中增加二点八倍！当然，也可以提出数字，然后像茨冈人过去所作的那样，背弃诺言，溜之大吉。（场内笑声）但是梁赞人并不打算逃到什么地方去。他们许下了诺言，并且顺利地履行着这个诺言。好得很，同志们！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    梁赞人现在就已经预尝到由于定将完成所承担的保证而得到的愉快而无愧的光荣滋味了。而且不光梁赞的情况是这样！请看看其他共和国和州吧。在我们国家，人们到处都可以找到不平凡的事业，并且正在建树自己的劳动功勋，对共产主义建设作出自己的贡献！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    马克思主义者永远反对掠夺性的战争，但并不害怕战争　如果统治阶级把战争强加给人民，共产党人就接受战斗，努力使其矛头指向统治阶级，使之有利于劳动人民。
    同志们！现在在国际关系中出现的缓和，看来，将继续发展下去。在西方，有人说什么苏联改变了自己的政策，所以和我们打交道容易些了。这当然是不对的。我们生为共产党人，作为共产党人而活着，而不会死去，并且今后将作为共产党人而继续前进！（暴风雨般的掌声、喊声：“光荣归于共产党人！”“我们的党万岁！”）
    还有人说，苏联只是在现在才提出了共处的口号。这当然也是不正确的。这个口号是列宁提出的，而我们感到自豪的，正是伟大的列宁——共产主义的领袖提出了这个口号！（暴风雨般的掌声）有些人四十二年来一直不承认和平共处的口号，而现在连资产阶级的政治家们也开始承认它了。可见，他们变得聪明起来了！我们感到自豪的是，我们过去和现在一直是照着首先提出这个口号的列宁的教导那样去做的。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    为什么资产阶级政治家开始承认和平共处的思想呢？人们说，存在决定意识。有些人夸张地说：“打决定意识”。我要说，两者都对。（场内欢跃、掌声）原来，在这个“存在”中，“打”帮助了某些人。到头来，他们开始承认必须和平共处。（掌声）否则，资本主义国家会移动到哪里去呢？他们想把我们移开。难道你能把我们移开吗？！我们不想从自己的家园移开；我们是定居的人。我们也不希望把他们移开。干吗我们要那样做呢？那里也是人呀！资本主义国家的劳动人民也希望过和平和美好的生活；而为了这种生活，我们是不惜自己的力量的。资本主义国家的人民不是我们的敌人，而是我们的朋友！至于在若干国家掌握最高权柄的好战的帝国主义集团，那要另当别论了。但是同志们，大家知道，要消灭臭虫，并不需要烧房子；要同帝国主义者进行斗争，并不需要同住在资本主义国家的劳动人民打仗。
    我们马克思主义者永远反对掠夺性战争，永远！但是，共产党人并不害怕战争，如果统治阶级把战争强加给人民，那么，共产党人就接受战斗，努力使它的矛头指向统治阶级，使它有利于工人阶级，有利于劳动人民。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    为什么死顽固现在也变得聪明了一些呢，为什么现在他们明白这个呢？水滴石穿，而真理是可以把岩石和钢铁都打穿的！我们的列宁的真理把那些反对和不承认社会主义制度的顽固派的基石打穿了。帝国主义集团利益的最狂热的代表者，已故的杜勒斯先生尽管给人留下了不愉快的记忆，但是，同时必须指出，在他的晚年，他对某些事情也有了新的看法。
    同志们，有人问我，我读的我们苏联记者的文章多，还是非苏联记者的文章多，我要坦率地说，这个问题可不好答复啊。我觉得，我读的资产阶级记者的东西更多些。你们不要见怪，这是符合咱们大家的利益的。（活跃）我们必须很好地知道在资本主义世界里所发生的事情，那里关于苏联谈了些什么，写了些什么。现在是什么惹起资本主义世界的不安？目前，那里已经没有人说，我们的七年计划完不成了。现在资本家们也承认，七年计划能够完成。而这恰恰引起他们不安。可是，我们相信，七年计划不仅能完成，而且能超额完成。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我国工人、集体农民、科学家、工程师和技术员以自己的轰动全世界的成就，使资本主义国家的统治集团也不得不承认我们的成就和和平共处的必要性。现在，大家都看到，与资本主义国家并列存在着的是迅速发展的社会主义国家。这是无法否认的千真万确的事实。列宁曾说过：在一、二十年以后，到那时我们将是不可战胜的。我们已经生存了四十二年，即两个二十年，我们证实了列宁预见的正确性。
    苏联提出全面裁军计划是由于意识到有责任尽一切力量维护和巩固世界和平。苏联掌握有最有毁灭性的武器，如果有人胆敢侵犯，就能将它从地球上消灭掉。
    同志们！我们以我们的伟大的列宁、列宁主义和我们苏维埃人民用劳动取得的成就而自豪。现在，社会主义力量已经空前巩固地牢不可破地确立起来。苏联提出了全面彻底裁军的计划。我们愿意真心诚意地裁军。但是，要让帝国主义者知道，我们提出这个建议并不是由于在军事上、经济上或者政治上软弱。不是的，我们之所以这样做，是因为意识到有责任尽一切力量维护和巩固世界和平，意识到战争只会给各国人民带来灾难。我们希望我国人民，希望各国人民都有和平。（经久不息的掌声）
    如果谈到我国的经济能力和苏维埃国家的国防力量的话，那么，应该说，今年我们的阅兵是最短的，虽然到今年苏联军队已经积蓄了最不可战胜的力量。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    几年以前我曾说过，我国制成了洲际弹道火箭。当时许多资本主义国家人士说，大概赫鲁晓夫在吹牛吧。后来当我们的这种火箭投入生产时，我说，我们已在成批生产洲际火箭。他们又开始叫嚷说，这不可能，赫鲁晓夫又在吹牛了。
    （米高扬：让他们也来吹吹看！）
    吹牛是可以的，但是必须让全世界都看到你所吹的东西。我们是这样“吹牛”的：全世界都看到了我们的火箭飞到了月球，并且落在那上面了！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
    可见，这已经不是吹牛了。这是真正的事实。亲爱的同志们，主席团委员们，我想，我讲下面这些话不会是泄漏秘密——这里我希望人们能正确地理解我的话：我们不想恫吓任何人，但是我们可以讲真话——现在我们已经有了这么多的火箭，这么多的原子弹头和氢弹头，如果有人胆敢侵犯我们，那么我们就能够把一切可能侵犯我们的敌人从地球上消灭掉。（经久不息的掌声）
    在参观一个工厂的时候，我们了解了工人、工程师、科学家制造火箭的情况。在参观的时候，感情是矛盾的，这里生产的是最致命、最有毁灭性的武器；而另一方面，也为我们拥有这种武器而自豪。可能有人会说，赫鲁晓夫陷入矛盾中了：他既然主张和平，又曾获得加强国际和平列宁奖金，但同时却在为生产毁灭性武器感到自豪。我之所以感到自豪是因为这种武器掌握在最热爱和平的国家手里，掌握在捍卫和平事业的共产党和我国人民手里。这是对付胆敢发动战争的人的一种严峻的武器。因此，它是保卫和平的后盾。
    但是，我们的政策不是“实力地位”政策。今年，我们在联合国大会上提出了全面彻底裁军的建议。我们愿意毁掉所有的火箭。顺便谈谈（也让国外人知道知道，我不隐讳）：我们参观过的这个工厂一年来连续生产了二百五十个带有氢弹弹头的火箭。如果折合成普通爆炸物，这就是许多个百万吨。你们可以想像，如果这种毁灭性武器在某个国家上空爆炸，那么，那里就根本什么都不会剩下了。
    我们有这样强大的武器保卫自己的祖国。我们虽然有这种武器，但是我们声明，为了保障世界和平、为了未来，我们情愿把所有这些武器扔到大海里去，让所有的人们——我们这代和我们的后代都能生活得安宁，让他们知道，我们不仅不希望战争，而且也不愿拥有作战的武器。如果其他国家肯仿效我们的作法，我们愿意立刻销毁所有这些武器。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我们的事情进行得很顺利。我国的经济日益发展。苏联的威力日益加强。生活就是这样！同志们，这是不坏的生活吧！（全场欢跃、暴风雨般的掌声）
    在美国，反对裁军的人还很有势力。帝国主义者如果一定要回到“冷战”的立场上，那么，总会以更大的失败而告终。
    我们对我们同其他国家的关系现在开始改善感到满意。你们记得，还是在今年年初，英国首相麦克米伦先生曾经访问过苏联。作为政府首脑的我和我政府里的同志们同麦克米伦先生进行了非常有益的会谈，这次会谈对当前国际局势的改善起了不小的作用。如果拿1955年在日内瓦的政府首脑会议上我们同英国国家领导人进行的会谈（当时麦克米伦先生是外交大臣，而首相是艾登先生），或1956年我们去伦敦访问时所进行的会谈来同在莫斯科的会谈比较一下，那末，就非常清楚，形势改变了。对于和平共处的必要性的理解有了进展。
    我同美国总统艾森豪威尔先生会见过三次。还在1945年他就来过莫斯科，那时我没有同他会谈过。但是，如果把1955年我们在日内瓦同他和杜勒斯先生的会谈跟不久前在华盛顿举行的会谈相比较，那么应当说，这两次会晤相隔期间并不长，可是我们关系中的进展却不小。我们觉得总统真诚希望达成协议和取得国际紧张局势的缓和。这是非常值得高兴的！当然，这还只是我们的印象，而人的感觉是——一个不很准确的测量仪器；这里可能有不少主观成分。但是，我们仍然希望，改善关系的愿望很快会具有具体的形式。
    在华盛顿会谈的时候，我曾对艾森豪威尔先生说，他的处境当然与我不同。我受苏联政府的全权委托，本着我国人民的愿望，可以立即签订关于裁军、关于停止生产和销毁武器的协定。我认为，总统也希望这样做，但是，他所以没有能够这样做，看来是因为在美国，反对裁军的人还很有势力。对于这一点我们不应当受迷惑。
    我昨天看了纳尔逊·洛克菲勒先生的演说词。我还在日内瓦就同他会过面。不久前，我在纽约又同他会晤过。他在最近的一次演说中讲了些好话，也讲了些坏话。这里反映出某些集团希望使晴雨表的指针倒转。这个指针现在倾向于国际紧张局势的缓和，从“阴”到“晴”，而主张“冷战”的人却在把它拨向另一个方向。但是，帝国主义者先生们，如果你们一定要回到“冷战”的立场上，那么，洛克菲勒是救不了你们的，正像杜勒斯救不了你们一样。你们可以延长“冷战”，但是它总会以反对缓和国际紧张局势的那些人的更大的失败而告终的。（掌声）
    我们很快就要访问法国，同戴高乐总统会见。我们很重视这次访问。苏联政府认为，我们同法国可以取得相互谅解。我们的道路在任何地方都没有相互叉住过。苏联的经济是独立的，它不是建立在他国财富的基础之上，因此，在我国和法国之间不存在发生任何冲突和分歧的理由。当然，我们在德国问题上抱有不同的态度，但是我想，形式上的分歧大于实质上的分歧，因为法国人对德国的复仇主义者并不比我们更有好感。戴高乐总统理解到德国复仇主义复活的危险性。但是，当然，在德国问题上还有许多错综复杂的情况需要考虑到。我想，这次访问法国将是有益的，它将有助于我们取得更好的相互了解。但是，为什么要猜测未来呢。俄国人有句俗语：只要活下去，总会看到的。
    阿登纳现在想的不是什么好事。苏联过去、现在和将来都不会承认波恩复仇主义者对西柏林的权利。
    阿登纳总理先生现在想的不是什么好事。我在最近的两次讲话中都没提他的名字，这一点记者们已觉察到了。可是第三次我就不能不提到他了。（欢跃）波恩扬言要在西柏林建立自己的无线电台。我们认为这种企图是非法的，是挑衅行为。波恩的复仇主义者想必是要惹我们采取尖锐措施来回敬他们。他们希望我们帮助他们重新加剧“冷战”。然而，先生们，如果你们走这条道路，那等着你们的只有失败，没有别的。我们过去一直没有承认，现在不承认，将来也不会承认你们对西柏林的权利。请你们不要忘记这一点，波恩的复仇主义先生们。（掌声）
    为了不使情况复杂化，我本来不想对可能成为政府首脑会议讨论对象的具体问题发表意见。但是，又不得不谈，这不能怪我，是别人使我们不得不这样做。在这种情况下，我们不可能、也不会按着这样一种箴言行事，这个箴言就是：当有人打你左脸颊的时候，你得把右脸颊也伸过去。我们将像人那样行事：如果有人打我们的左脸颊，我们将给以同样的还击，使他们以后休想这样做。（经久不息的掌声）我们希望波恩复仇主义者把自己的狂热收敛一下，并希望他们像不好打架的人那样行事。让我们最好来谈判。大家知道，西柏林不属于德意志联邦共和国，而是在德意志民主共和国的领土上。（暴风雨般的掌声）但愿谁也不要采取这种或那种不理智的行动和决策来加剧世界上这个地区和其他地区的局势。不理智的行动只能加剧紧张局势，而不能解决争端。
    新闻工作者不仅是党的忠实助手，而且是党的配手——为党的伟大事业而奋斗的积极战士，像最可靠的传送带一样，拿着党的决议，深入地带到人民中去。
    亲爱的新闻工作者同志们！我们把作家叫做党的助手。如果我说，你们新闻工作者不仅是我们党的忠实助手，而且简直是我们党的配手——为党的伟大事业而奋斗的积极战士，这请作家们别见我的怪。（暴风雨般的掌声）为什么是配手呢？因为你们的确总是在党的左右。一有某项决议需要解释和实现时，我们就找你们，而你们就好像是最可靠的传动带一样，拿着党的决议，把它深入地带到我国人民当中去了。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们党的力量在于同人民群众的不可分割的联系。我们报刊的力量、它的巨大影响的源泉在于报刊给群众带来的东西的实质。而实质就是我们党的列宁主义政策，关于建设社会主义和共产主义的列宁主义思想。挑起这个担子是容易的，因为它并不沉重。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    （维·阿·卡尔平斯基：我们满腔热忱地挑着这付担子。）
    对，我们大家都满腔热忱地挑着这付担子。这付担子不是沉重的累赘，你感觉不出是一付担子，它鼓舞着你，呼唤着你，引导你前进。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    同志们！你们新闻工作者工作做得很好。但是可别骄傲自满。不要因受到夸奖你们就像已经抓住了上帝的胡子了。（欢跃）在我们的报纸上还有很多乏味的东西。有时你拿起报纸，翻一翻就放在一边了。过后就想不起这份报上究竟登过什么。我说这个是让你们不要骄傲自满。报纸应该办得合理，不要在排版的那天才做准备。真正的领导者应该有先见之明，应为哪一期准备什么样的主题。他不仅应该善于选择主题，同时也应该善于挑选能手，把主题加工得像一席美味的午餐，使人在吃过以后还想舔干净指头上的余味。（掌声）
    当然，我们的报纸无比地成长了，我们的新闻工作者也成长起来了，但是，完善是没有止境的。因此，今后必须努力、努力再努力，使我们的报纸成为最强有力的最富有战斗性的报纸。至于真实性和思想性我就不谈了，因为我们的报纸过去是、现在是、将来仍然是世界上最真实的和最有思想性的报纸。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    在西方，有些人仍然喜欢把世界分成西方国家和东方国家；分成所谓自由世界国家和所谓铁幕国家。这里他们认为资本主义世界的国家是自由的国家。这种人应该问问自己的良心！在他们硬说资本主义国家是自由的国家的时候，他们可以说是不知羞耻。照他们的说法，社会主义国家不是自由的国家，而血腥的独裁者、资本家和封建主的傀儡佛朗哥的制度倒是自由的制度。如果把这个也叫做自由的话，天晓得，他们是怎样理解自由的？！
    他们还称西德是“自由国家”。但是，如果把禁止共产党的活动、迫害进步组织、审讯和镇压和平拥护者以及军国主义和反动派的反对者，都理解为自由的话，那末怎样才算是没有自由呢？
    在某些资本主义国家里，甚至连资产阶级的自由概念都抛弃了。为什么？因为有人感到依靠“资产阶级自由”来保证维持对工人阶级的剥削已经不够了。因此，他们现在撕下了假面具，露出了他们的真面目，暴露出他们对工人、对劳动人民的独裁统治。如果这一切都叫做自由的话，那末，正如俗话所说的，让上帝拯救我们离开这种“自由的朋友”吧，我们自己会对付敌人的。（场内活跃）
    苏联的七年计划不仅将能完成，而且将超额完成，苏联以事实向全世界证明，社会主义和共产主义不仅是人类的崇高理想，而且是现实的。
    这就是我所要谈的国内外形势。我们应当同资本主义国家和平共处，因为各国的政治制度和社会制度是各国人民的内政问题。但是，我们并不是呆在高大的围墙后面，一无所见、一无所知。我们不干涉别人的事，但是我们将像过去一样维护劳动人民的利益。我们过去支持，今后也要支持工人和所有劳动人民争取自身权利、反对资本剥削的斗争，但是我们过去没有干涉、将来也不干涉别国的内政。无产阶级的团结，这是我们的权利，这是每个诚实的劳动者的权利。已经摆脱了资本剥削的人不能对自己的阶级弟兄的命运漠不关心。（掌声）我们的同情是在为反对殖民主义奴役、为争取自由和独立而斗争的殖民地人民方面。
    亲爱的同志们，我要结束我的讲话了。我代表党中央和党中央主席团再一次衷心地向你们表示问候。祝你们工作和生活事事如意。祝你们生活好，心情舒畅，工作顺利。
    当我们来这儿的时候，克利门特·叶弗列莫维奇要我讲一讲，我们现在没有因犯政治罪而受法院审判的事实。可是我已经不止一次地谈到过这一点。同志们，难道这还是秘密吗？（有人喊“大家都知道”。掌声）
    这一切并不意味着，我们现在应该放松警惕。这是不明智的想法。我国国内现在没有阶级斗争和敌人活动的社会基础，但是，只要我们同资本主义国家一起生活和相处，社会主义的敌人过去和将来都会把他们的间谍派遣到我们这里来。因此，我们应该保持警惕，对敌人的间谍的阴谋诡计给予回击。
    我国的现状使我们非常满意。苏维埃国家无论在经济和文化方面，还是在科学发展方面，都是日新月异地蒸蒸日上。这就使我们拥有更雄厚的力量。苏联共产党中央委员会和中央委员会主席团深信，发展国民经济的七年计划不仅将能完成，而且将超额完成。在1960年，我们将要过渡到七小时工作日，在1964年将开始过渡到六小时工作日。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    但是，如果我们的全面彻底裁军的建议被采纳的话，（我们目前还未统计过）我想，我们就能使我国一半工人在这个七年计划期间就过渡到六小时工作日。这就是我国政府所考虑的，这就是苏维埃国家的人民所向往的。（掌声）
    我们苏联人有一个愿望，这就是生活得更美好、更富裕、更丰富多彩。我们坚信自己的力量，坚信自己的潜力。党的第二十一次代表大会提出的全面展开共产主义建设的任务正在顺利地实现。作为优秀的能手——列宁主义者，我们以事实向全世界证明，社会主义和共产主义——这不仅是人类的崇高理想，而且是现实的。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    亲爱的朋友们，我们今后仍将坚持不懈地为共产主义的胜利而奋斗！你们新闻工作者在我国人民——共产主义的建设者——在党的领导下所进行的这一伟大的事业中占着光荣的地位。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我们光荣的苏联人民万岁！
    我们的列宁主义的共产党万岁！
    为人民的幸福、为建设共产主义而奋斗不息的文字劳动者——新闻工作者万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声、高呼：“乌拉！”）
                              （新华社据塔斯社莫斯科17日电）
