The Tanqiao Production Team of Pengpu People's Commune in Baoshan County, Shanghai, has raised a red flag for developing pig raising with meager resources. This team has raised a total of 4,269 pigs in the past ten months, nearly doubling the number from last year.

This production team is located in the suburbs of Shanghai. During the period of the advanced cooperative, pig raising was relatively well-established. Having less land and a relatively large labor force, and it being more convenient to obtain feed from the city, were their favorable conditions. However, as the number of pigs raised soared, and with the large-scale pig raising by urban institutions and enterprises starting in June this year, many units that originally supplied them with feed stopped doing so, and the shortage of feed became a prominent contradiction. At the same time, with more pigs being raised, there were also not enough sheds. Faced with such difficulties, the cadres and members of this production team mustered their energy and sought various ways to rely on their own efforts to achieve rapid development in pig raising.

In the process of solving the feed problem, this team initially had a debate over two methods. A few people believed that "to raise pigs well, you must rely on refined feed as the main source. If you use green and coarse feed as the main source, the pigs will develop slowly and gain less meat." Therefore, their conclusion was: "It is better to raise fewer pigs than to raise more." However, most people believed that it was possible to raise pigs using meager resources, using green feed to replace refined feed when there was not enough, and using coarse feed to feed when there was not enough fine feed; moreover, "the city's feed is inexhaustible. We will get the inferior ones from what others have done well; we will get the odds and ends from what others have done completely. As long as we look for it, we can always find it." "As long as green and coarse feed are washed clean, cut finely, and thoroughly cooked, and we are willing to put in the effort, we can always raise good pigs." Therefore, their conclusion was: "We must raise more pigs, raise them big, and raise them well." Based on the opinions of the majority, the team's Party branch mobilized the masses to use their brains and find ways to solve the feed problem. As expected, there were endless ways to use meager resources. First, they organized a professional team of more than 40 people to specialize in collecting rotten melons, fruits, and vegetables in the city, such as golden melon rinds, watermelon rinds, rotten sweet potatoes, and wild rice stems, generally obtaining 250 to 260 dan per day; in vegetable fields, they collected every vegetable root and every vegetable leaf, gathering a little of everything, obtaining 2,000 jin per mu every 40 days. They also organized auxiliary labor to cut wild grass and plant water hyacinth and duckweed in small rivers, greatly increasing the source of green and coarse feed. In addition, they also used scattered land and fig fields to grow barley, and filtered out shriveled wheat grains from the sewage ditches of flour mills, which also increased the source of refined feed. This team finally basically solved the contradiction of insufficient feed.

This team also used meager resources to solve the problem of sheds. On the one hand, they made full use of old sheds, and on the other hand, they rationally renovated the sheds. They initially used a broken wooden boat and some scattered materials to build nine earth sheds, setting an example. Then, the Party branch mobilized everyone to widely collect waste bamboo, wooden sticks, bricks, as well as stone slabs and rocks, and continued to build more than 30 earth sheds. In this way, they basically solved the contradiction of insufficient sheds.

This team also implemented the spirit of diligence and frugality in pig raising everywhere in its feeding management. They tried their best to be careful and calculated in feeding, feeding in a planned way, and saving refined feed. For example, meat pigs are given more refined feed in the early stages of weaning, more green and coarse feed when they are growing their frames, and then appropriately given some refined feed when fattening. Some breeders only use 10% of refined feed and still raise pigs very well. In management, the breeders have all learned some skills in preventing epidemics and treating diseases. They use folk methods to treat white dysentery, which is highly effective and saves money. Therefore, they raised more pigs and raised them well, and the mortality rate was very low.

With more pigs being raised, there is also more fertilizer. The pig manure of this team cannot be used up by themselves (the whole team has a total of 285 mu of land), and they can supply more than 200 dan of pig manure to the Tangnan Production Team of the same commune every day. With more pigs being raised, there are also more pigs being marketed. From January to October this year, the whole team sold a total of 1,355 meat pigs to the state and supported other places with 600 piglets. The commune's income has also increased greatly. From January to October this year, the team's total income from pig raising reached more than 90,000 yuan, accounting for 43.6% of the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations.

In order to make more fertilizer, support the city with more meat pigs, and further increase the income of the commune, this team is ambitious. In addition to requiring the number of pigs raised this year to reach 5,500, they are planning to raise more pigs. (Attached picture)

    因地制宜寻找饲料　因陋就简解决猪棚
    多快好省发展养猪事业
    谈桥生产队十个月养猪四千头比去年增加一倍
    本报讯　上海市宝山县彭浦人民公社谈桥生产队树起了一面用穷办法发展养猪事业的红旗。这个队今年十个月来共养了四千二百六十九头猪，比去年将近翻了一番。
    这个生产队地处上海近郊。在高级社时期，养猪就较有基础。地少劳动力比较多，从城市取得饲料也比较方便，这是他们的有利条件。但是，随着猪的饲养量激增，加上今年6月市区机关、企业也大量养猪，原来供给他们饲料的许多单位都停止了供应，饲料不足就成了突出的矛盾。同时，猪养多了，棚舍也不够。面对这样的困难，这个生产队的干部和社员鼓足干劲，寻找各种办法，自力更生，使养猪事业获得了飞速的发展。
    这个队在解决饲料问题的过程中，起初存在着两种方法的争论。少数人认为，“猪要养得好，非要以精饲料为主不行。以青、粗饲料为主，猪发育慢，长肉少。”因此，他们的结论是：“多养不如少养。”但大多数人认为可以采取穷办法养猪，精料不够用青料代，细料不够用粗料喂；而且，“市区饲料取之不尽，人家搞好的，我们就搞差的；人家搞整的，我们就搞零的。只要去找，总能找到。”“青粗饲料只要洗得净、切得细、烧得透，肯下功夫，总能养好猪。”因此，他们的结论是：“猪一定要多养，养得大，也养得好。”队党支部根据大多数人的意见，发动群众大家动脑筋、想办法，解决饲料问题。穷办法果然办法无穷。他们首先组织起四十多人的专业队伍，专门到市区去搜集烂瓜果蔬菜，如黄金瓜西瓜皮、烂山芋、茭白壳等，一般一天能搞到二百五十到二百六十担；蔬菜地里一棵菜根，一张菜叶，有一点收一点，每亩田四十天可搞到二千斤。他们还组织了辅助劳动力去割野草，在小河浜里种植水浮莲和水葫芦，使青粗饲料的来源大为增加。此外，他们还利用零星地和无花果田来种大麦，到面粉厂的污水沟里去滤出瘪的麦谷，也增加了一部分精饲料的来源。这个队终于基本上解决了饲料不足的矛盾。
    这个队在解决棚舍问题上，同样使用了穷办法。一方面充分利用旧棚，一方面合理改建棚舍。他们起初利用一只破木船，和一些零星材料，造起了九间土棚，做出了榜样。接着党支部发动大家广泛收集废旧毛竹、木棍、砖头以及石板和石块，继续造起了三十多间土棚。这样，他们就基本上解决了棚舍不足的矛盾。
    这个队在饲养管理上也处处贯彻勤俭养猪的精神。喂食尽量精打细算，有计划地喂，节约精饲料。如肉猪在隔奶初期多给些精料，长架子时就多喂青粗料，催肥时再适当给些精饲料。有的饲养员只搭用10％的精饲料，也把猪养得很好。在管理上，饲养员们都学了一些防瘟治病的本领，他们用土法治白痢病，疗效高，又省钱。因此，他们的猪既养得多又养得好，死亡率很低。
    猪养得多，肥也就多。这个队的猪粪自己用不完（全队共有土地二百八十五亩），每天可供给同公社的塘南生产队二百担以上的猪粪。猪养得多，上市量也多，今年1到10月，全队共卖给国家一千三百五十五头肉猪，支援别处六百头苗猪。公社的收入也大大增加，今年1到10月全队在养猪方面的总收入达九万多元，占农副业总收入的43.6％。
    为了造更多的肥，把更多的肉猪支援城市，进一步增加公社的收入，这个队雄心勃勃，除了要求今年猪的饲养量达到五千五百头外，正在计划养更多的猪。（附图片）
