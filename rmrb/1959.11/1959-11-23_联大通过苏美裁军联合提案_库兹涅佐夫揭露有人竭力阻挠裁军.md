    Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 21st: According to TASS, the 14th Session of the United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the morning of November 20th to discuss the report submitted by the Political Committee regarding the Soviet proposal on complete and thorough disarmament. The General Assembly unanimously approved the Soviet-U.S. joint draft resolution adopted by the Committee, with the remaining eighty delegations also acting as drafters of the proposal.
    The head of the Soviet delegation, Soviet First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Kuznetsov, delivered a speech at the meeting.
    Kuznetsov said that it is necessary to lay a reasonable and solid foundation for the principle of peaceful coexistence. He pointed out that the issue of disarmament is the most important issue at present.
    Kuznetsov said that the process of discussing this issue at the United Nations General Assembly shows that the vast majority of countries attending the United Nations General Assembly recognize the importance and timeliness of the Soviet proposal. The resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly today will undoubtedly signify an important step on the road to actually resolving this issue.
    Kuznetsov said, however, that there are still some influential forces that are trying hard to obstruct realistic measures in the field of complete and thorough disarmament. Under the current conditions, they do not dare to openly oppose the proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, and are therefore adopting and will adopt roundabout tactics, creating various obstacles, attempting to spread doubts about the feasibility of the idea of ​​thorough disarmament, and so on.
    Kuznetsov said that when the Soviet Union put forward the proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, it had repeatedly stated that it was willing to study and discuss amendments and supplements to this proposal, and was also willing to study and discuss other proposals aimed at resolving the issue of disarmament.
    Kuznetsov said that it is very clear that the practical issues associated with the implementation of a complete and thorough disarmament plan need to be carefully studied and negotiated. The ten-nation disarmament committee, which will be formed early next year, should do this work. However, this committee should not deviate from the essence of the most important task it faces, and engage in unproductive debates on various issues that need to be considered.
    Then, the General Assembly began to discuss other agenda items.

    联大通过苏美裁军联合提案
    库兹涅佐夫揭露有人竭力阻挠裁军
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社纽约20日讯：联合国大会第十四届会议20日上午举行全体会议，讨论政治委员会就苏联关于全面和彻底裁军的建议所提出的报告。大会一致批准了委员会通过的苏美联合提案，其余八十个代表团也作为这一提案的起草人。
    苏联代表团团长、苏联外交部第一副部长库兹涅佐夫在会上发了言。
    库兹涅佐夫说，必须为和平共处原则奠定合理的和巩固的基础。他指出，裁军问题是当前最重要的问题。
    库兹涅佐夫说，这一问题在联合国大会上讨论的过程表明，出席联合国大会的绝大多数国家都承认苏联建议的重要性和及时性。联合国大会今天通过的决议，无疑将意味着实际解决这一问题道路上的重要步骤。
    库兹涅佐夫说，但是，还存在一些有影响的势力，它们竭力阻挠在全面和彻底裁军方面采取现实措施。在目前的条件下它们不敢公开反对全面和彻底裁军的建议，因此正在采取和将要采取迂回战术，制造各种障碍，企图对彻底裁军的主张的现实性散布怀疑等等。
    库兹涅佐夫说，苏联提出全面和彻底裁军建议时，它已经多次表明过，它愿意研究和讨论对这一建议提出的修正和补充，同时也愿意研究和讨论其他旨在解决裁军问题的建议。
    库兹涅佐夫说，十分清楚，同实现全面和彻底裁军计划联在一起的实际问题需要仔细地研究和协商。明年年初由十个国家组成的裁军问题委员会应当做这个工作。但是，这一委员会不应当使自己离开它所面临的最重大任务的实质，而围绕各种需要考虑的问题进行毫无益处的辩论。
    然后，大会即开始讨论其他议程。
