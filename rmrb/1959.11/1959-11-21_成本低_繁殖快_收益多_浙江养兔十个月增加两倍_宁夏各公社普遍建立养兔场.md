    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou - Zhejiang Province's domestic rabbit production has rapidly developed. By the end of October, the province had raised more than 4,910,000 domestic rabbits, an increase of two times compared to the end of last year. Many counties such as Jiaxing, Haining, Wuxing, Shengxian, and Linhai have seen a new phenomenon of communes, production teams, and commune members' families raising rabbits.
    Rabbit farming has the advantages of low production costs, fast breeding, and high profits. One rabbit can produce two dan of high-quality fertilizer each year, which is also of great benefit to promoting agricultural production. Rabbit skin and rabbit fur are industrial raw materials, and rabbit meat is delicious. Developing rabbit production can also increase the amount of meat available. At the same time, rabbits are easy to raise, and semi-able-bodied people such as the elderly, women, and children can manage them. In addition to a few agricultural by-products, the main feed is green grass. Last year, the Hongxing Rabbit Farm in Shengxian County earned more than 17,000 yuan from rabbit farming, and used some of the money to buy water pumps, which strongly supported agricultural production.
    The rapid development of domestic rabbit production in Zhejiang Province is mainly due to the strengthening of leadership over rabbit production by local Party organizations and the implementation of the principle of combining collective breeding with decentralized breeding. After the Party committees at all levels in the Ningbo area strengthened their leadership over rabbit production, the communes, brigades, and production teams have now established 1,152 collective breeding farms. By the end of October, the number of rabbits raised had increased from 454,000 at the end of last year to more than 1,077,700. The number of rabbits raised in Wuxing County has increased from more than 160,000 at the end of last year to more than 455,000, an increase of more than double.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan - People's communes in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are vigorously developing rabbit production. By the end of October, the entire autonomous region had raised more than 460,500 domestic rabbits.
    Rabbit farming is a sideline production with little investment and quick results. The autonomous region has abundant natural conditions for aquatic plants, which are suitable for the development of rabbit farming. Since the beginning of this year, people's communes in various places have attached importance to rabbit farming while vigorously grasping animal husbandry production, and the rabbit farming industry has achieved rapid development. In the process of developing rabbit farming, all localities have earnestly implemented the principle of "giving equal importance to public and private raising." On the one hand, they have actively developed collective rabbit production, and on the other hand, they have mobilized commune members' families to raise rabbits. Now, communes in various places have universally established rabbit farms. The result of large-scale rabbit farming in the communes not only provides the cities and industrial production with rabbit meat, rabbit skins, rabbit fur and other meat and industrial raw materials, but also increases the income of the communes and commune members. This year, the Luoqu Brigade of the Wuzhong Commune increased its income by an average of 25 yuan per household due to rabbit farming. In addition, the accumulated rabbit manure is enough for topdressing 5,000 mu of land.

    成本低  繁殖快  收益多
    浙江养兔十个月增加两倍
    宁夏各公社普遍建立养兔场
    新华社杭州讯　浙江省的家兔生产迅速发展。到10月底，全省已养家兔四百九十一万多只，比去年年底增加了二倍。嘉兴、海宁、吴兴、嵊县、临海等许多县出现了公社、生产队和社员家庭都养兔的新气象。
    养兔生产成本轻、繁殖快、收益多。一只兔子每年能积二担优质肥，对促进农业生产也有很大好处。兔皮、兔毛是工业原料，兔肉味道鲜美，发展家兔生产还能增加大量肉类。同时，兔子饲养简便，老人、妇女、小孩等半劳动力都可管理，饲料除了少数农作物副产品外，主要是青草。嵊县红星兔场去年养兔收入一万七千多元，拿出一部分买了抽水机，有力地支援了农业生产。
    浙江省家兔生产发展得快，主要是各地党组织加强对家兔生产的领导，贯彻了集体饲养和分散饲养相结合的方针。宁波专区各级党委加强对家兔生产领导后，现在各公社、大队、生产队已办起集体饲养场一千一百五十二个，到10月底家兔饲养数已从去年年底的四十五万四千只，增加到一百零七万七千多只。吴兴县养的兔从去年年底的十六万多只，发展到四十五万五千多只，增加一倍以上。
    新华社银川讯　宁夏回族自治区各地人民公社，大力发展养兔生产。到10月底，全自治区已饲养家兔四十六万零五百多只。
    养兔是一种投资少，见效快的副业生产。自治区有丰富的水草自然条件，适宜于养兔业的发展。今年以来，各地人民公社在大抓畜牧业生产中，重视了养兔工作，养兔业获得了很快的发展。各地在发展养兔业的过程中，都认真执行了“公养和私养并重”的方针，一方面积极发展集体养兔生产，一方面发动社员家庭饲养。现在各地公社都普遍建立了养兔场。各公社大量养兔的结果，不仅给城市和工业生产提供了兔肉、兔皮、兔毛等肉类和工业原料，而且增加了公社和社员的收入。吴忠公社罗渠大队今年由于养兔，按户数计算，平均每户增加收入二十五元，另外，积下的大量兔粪，足够五千亩地施追肥用。
