Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 24th -- Fair-minded public opinion in Indonesia is expressing concern over the anti-Chinese movement currently taking place in Indonesia, and is calling for vigilance against imperialist plots of provocation. They are also calling for the resolution of Overseas Chinese issues between China and Indonesia in accordance with the principles of the Bandung Conference and through friendly consultations.

The "Eastern Star Newspaper" editorial on November 18th, discussing the issue of Indonesia prohibiting Overseas Chinese small merchants from operating in small towns and rural areas, and prohibiting Overseas Chinese from residing in small towns and rural areas of West Java, stated: The complication of this issue will not only harm the interests of the Indonesian people and China, but also create a very unfavorable tense situation for the overall relations of Asian-African countries.

The editorial stated: In the struggle of Asian-African countries against imperialism and colonialism, China is one of the countries that has played a significant role. Attempting to drive China out of the scope of Asian-African countries is in the interests of imperialists and colonialists who want to weaken the strength of Asian-African countries. The editorial continued: This is the reason why the running dogs of imperialists are launching provocative activities, just like the provocative incidents that occurred in the Tibet issue, the Laos issue, and the Sino-Indian border issue.

The editorial stated that from the perspective of opposing imperialism and opposing colonialism, contradictions should not occur between Asian-African countries. The editorial stated that now that contradictions have occurred, we must fully promote the spirit of solidarity and cooperation among Asian-African countries to resolve these contradictions.

Mrs. Rasuna Said, Acting Chairman of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association, said in early November after returning to Indonesia from a visit to China: People must be vigilant against attempts aimed at undermining Asian-African solidarity. She pointed out that if we relax our vigilance and indulge our emotions, it will be most beneficial to those who are trying to disturb and poison the atmosphere in order to undermine Asian-African solidarity and realize their plots.

Prior to this, Indonesian parliamentarian Wedoyoyo also pointed out in a conversation that, seeing the spirit of Asian-African solidarity, the United States is trying every possible way to undermine the friendly relations between Indonesia and China. He said: People must be vigilant against the conspiracies of some people who exaggerate the problems between Indonesia and China.

Wedoyoyo hoped that the joint communiqué of the foreign ministers of Indonesia and China could be well implemented. He pointed out that Overseas Chinese retailers should be treated as friends, and no ideas of segregation and discrimination should be allowed.

Indonesia's "Awakening Weekly," in an earlier commentary criticizing the measures taken by the Central War Authority of the Indonesian Army in implementing the "Regulations on Supervising the Residence and Travel of Foreign Nationals," pointed out, "We must be doubly vigilant against imperialists using our nationalist sentiments to stir up anti-Chinese waves in order to achieve the despicable purpose of undermining the increasingly consolidated friendly relations between Indonesia and China." The weekly emphasized, "We must not fall into the trap set by imperialism."

The "Dawn Daily" pointed out in an editorial on November 20th entitled "Return to the Road of the Bandung Conference" that, regarding the situation caused by the anti-Chinese movement in Indonesia, "only those who hoped for Indonesia to fall into chaos from the beginning are happy." The newspaper said that these people hoped that the relationship between China and Indonesia would become tense or conflict. The newspaper expressed the hope that the Overseas Chinese issue could be resolved through peaceful consultation.

The "People's Daily" editorial on November 2nd stated: The joint communiqué of Chen Yi and Subandrio is in line with the Bandung principles and the Five Principles of Indonesian nation-building. The editorial said that, however, some groups in Indonesia believe that the joint communiqué is only a nominal statement signed according to diplomatic etiquette, and therefore it is not necessary to implement it seriously. As a result, several newspapers in the capital Jakarta and in various localities have repeatedly carried out incitement and provocative propaganda against their friendly neighbor, the People's Republic of China. They have turned the Overseas Chinese issue into a "Cold War" tool and a tool for subversion.

The editorial also said that Indonesia's most important task at present is to eliminate the forces of foreign imperialism in various fields in Indonesia. The Dutch capital in the Batavia Petroleum Company has not yet been nationalized, and the American and British oil companies and other Western large capital enterprises have not yet been nationalized. Under these circumstances, the Indonesian people cannot understand why drastic measures are being taken against small shops run by Overseas Chinese.

The "Republic Newspaper" pointed out in its editorial on September 23rd that, regarding the issue of foreign small traders in rural areas, wise solutions must be adopted so as not to affect the peace and interests of hundreds of thousands of people who have lived in Indonesia for several generations. The solution is not only to verbally declare that we attach importance to basic human rights, but also to truly realize the basic human rights that have become one of the spirits of Indonesian nationalism and the Five Principles of Nation-Building. The editorial pointed out that merely banning foreign small traders for international and racial reasons would give the impression that there is xenophobia.

"Eastern Star Newspaper," "People's Daily," and "Republic Newspaper" have also published editorials accusing the reactionary "Indonesia Archipelago Newspaper" of stirring up trouble using the Overseas Chinese issue.

"Eastern Star Newspaper" refuted the rumors spread by the "Indonesia Archipelago Newspaper" about Subandrio being "insulted" in China in an editorial on the 17th entitled "Despicable Incitement." Subandrio himself has denied such rumors. The newspaper said that this rumor only exposes this political attempt: they do not recognize the achievements made in the signing of the joint communiqué by Chen Yi and Subandrio, and they are trying to provoke disputes between China and Indonesia, especially when both countries are facing complex issues that must be resolved in a peaceful and friendly manner.

The newspaper said, "Indonesia Archipelago Newspaper" also fabricated news that China wanted to help the Indonesian rebel groups. The purpose of doing so is to make people forget the fact that the United States, the Netherlands, and the Chiang Kai-shek group were helping the Indonesian rebels.

Indonesia's "People's Daily" published an editorial on November 18th, condemning the anti-China and anti-Chinese movement launched by right-wing newspapers. It said that this was being carried out within the scope of the Cold War.

The newspaper pointed out that the right-wing newspapers fabricated rumors such as Subandrio being "insulted" in China, which only proves that they are not standing on the side of the Republic of Indonesia, but on "the other side of the ocean." The "People's Daily" also pointed out that the remarks of the right-wing newspapers show that they are hostile to all measures conducive to the implementation of the joint communiqué of the foreign ministers of Indonesia and China.

The "Republic Newspaper" editorial on the 16th accused the "Indonesia Archipelago Newspaper" of spreading rumors that the joint communiqué of the two foreign ministers gave the imperialist forces a headache and was unfavorable to them. The fabrication of those rumors was obviously intended to obstruct the implementation of the joint communiqué and provoke sentiments unfavorable to Asian-African solidarity.

    印度尼西亚公正舆论
    对印度尼西亚的排华运动表示忧虑
    要求警惕帝国主义挑拨阴谋，通过协商解决华侨问题
    新华社24日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚公正舆论对目前在印度尼西亚发生的排华运动表示忧虑，并且要求警惕帝国主义挑拨的阴谋。他们还要求在中国与印度尼西亚之间按照万隆会议的原则和通过友好协商的途径来解决华侨问题。
    “东星报”11月18日的社论在谈到印度尼西亚在禁止华侨小商贩在小市镇和农村地区营业和禁止华侨在西爪哇的小市镇和农村地区居住的问题时说：这个问题的复杂化不但会损害印度尼西亚人民和中国的利益，还会造成非常不利于亚非国家总的关系的紧张局势。
    社论说：在亚非国家反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中，中国是发挥过重大作用的国家之一。企图把中国从亚非国家的范围赶出去，是符合帝国主义者和殖民主义者削弱亚非国家的力量的利益的。社论接着说：这就是帝国主义者的走狗展开挑拨活动的原因，正如在西藏问题、老挝问题和中印边界问题上发生的那些挑拨事件一样。
    社论说，从反对帝国主义和反对殖民主义的利益这个角度来看，亚非国家之间根本就不应当发生矛盾。社论说，现在既然矛盾已经发生了，我们必须充分发扬亚非国家团结合作的精神来解决这些矛盾。
    印度尼西亚—中国友好协会代理主席拉苏娜·赛义德夫人11月初在结束对中国的访问回到印度尼西亚以后说：人们必须对目的在于破坏亚非团结的企图保持警惕。她指出，如果放松警惕和放纵感情的话，那么这将最有利于那些企图扰乱和毒化气氛以便破坏亚非团结、实现他们的阴谋的人。
    在这以前，印度尼西亚议员韦多约在一次谈话中也指出，看到亚非团结的精神，美国千方百计地企图破坏印度尼西亚和中国的友好关系。他说：人们必须警惕有些人的阴谋，他们夸大了印度尼西亚和中国之间的问题。
    韦多约希望印度尼西亚和中国两国外长的联合公报能够很好地加以实现。他指出，应当把华侨零售商当作朋友对待，不允许有隔离和歧视的想法。
    印度尼西亚“觉醒周刊”早在它的一篇批评印度尼西亚陆军中央战时掌权者采取“监督外侨居住和旅行条例”的措施的评论中曾经指出，“我们必须加倍警惕帝国主义者利用我们的民族主义情绪煽起排华的浪潮，以图达到破坏日见巩固的印度尼西亚和中国的友好关系的卑鄙目的。”这家周刊强调说，“我们切不可堕入帝国主义所设的圈套”。
    “黎明日报”在11月20日发表的一篇题为“回到万隆会议的道路上来”的社论中指出，对于由于在印度尼西亚发生排华运动而导致的局面，“只有那些在一开始就希望印度尼西亚陷入混乱的人才感到高兴”。这家报纸说，这些人希望中国和印度尼西亚之间的关系会变得紧张起来，或者发生冲突。这家报纸表示希望通过和平协商来解决华侨问题。
    “人民日报”在11月2日的社论中说：陈毅和苏班德里约的联合公报符合万隆原则，也符合印度尼西亚的建国五基。社论说，然而，印度尼西亚的某些集团认为，联合公报只是根据外交礼节签订的名义上的声明，因此不必要认真执行。结果，首都雅加达和地方上的若干报纸一再进行煽动和进行反对他们的友好邻国中华人民共和国的煽动性宣传。他们把华侨问题变成“冷战”工具和进行颠覆活动的工具。
    社论还说，印度尼西亚目前最重要的任务是在印度尼西亚各个领域消灭外国帝国主义力量。目前在巴达维亚石油公司的荷兰资本还没有收归国有，而美国和英国的石油企业以及其它西方大资本的企业也没有收归国有。在这种情况下，印度尼西亚人民不能够理解为什么对华侨的小商店采取激烈的措施。
    “共和国报”在9月23日的社论中指出，对于农村外侨小商贩问题，必须采取明智的解决措施才不致影响已经在印度尼西亚居住了好几代的几十万人的生活安宁和利益。其解决办法不是仅仅靠口头声明说要重视基本人权，而且必须真正实现成为印度尼西亚民族主义特征和建国五基的精神之一的基本人权。社论指出，仅仅为了国际和种族而取缔外侨小商贩，会引起的看法之一是：排外意识的存在。
    “东星报”、“人民日报”和“共和国报”还曾经发表社论，指责反动的“印度尼西亚群岛报”利用华侨问题兴风作浪。
    “东星报”17日在一篇题为“卑鄙的煽动”的社论中，驳斥了“印度尼西亚群岛报”散布的关于苏班德里约在中国受到“侮辱”的谣言。苏班德里约本人已经否认了这种谣言。这家报纸说，这种谣言只是暴露了这种政治企图：他们不承认陈毅和苏班德里约签订联合公报所取得的成就，他们企图挑起中国和印度尼西亚之间的纠纷，特别是当两国都面临着必须以和平友好的方法加以解决的复杂问题的时候。
    这家报纸说，“印度尼西亚群岛报”还捏造中国想要帮助印度尼西亚的叛乱集团的消息。这样做的目的是想使人民忘记是美国、荷兰和蒋介石集团在帮助印度尼西亚叛军的事实。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”11月18日发表社论，谴责右翼报纸发动的反华和排华运动。它说，这是在冷战的范围内进行的。
    这家报纸指出，右翼报纸捏造了像苏班德里约在中国受到“侮辱”这种谣言，这种做法只会证明，它们不是站在印度尼西亚共和国这一边，而是站在“大洋彼岸那一边”。“人民日报”还指出，右翼报纸的言论表明，它们敌视一切有利于执行印度尼西亚—中国两国外长联合公报的措施。
    “共和国报”16日的社论指责“印度尼西亚群岛报”散布谣言说，两国外交部长的联合公报使帝国主义势力感到头痛，并且对他们不利。制造那些谣言显然是为了妨碍联合公报的执行和挑起不利于亚非团结的情绪。
