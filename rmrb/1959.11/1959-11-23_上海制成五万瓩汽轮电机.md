Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 22nd: The Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant has manufactured a 50,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator. After a series of tests, its performance has been proven to fully meet requirements. Thus, the three major components of a complete set of 50,000 kilowatt thermal power generating equipment—the steam turbine, the steam turbine generator, and the power station boiler—have all been manufactured in Shanghai.

The three major components of this 50,000 kilowatt steam turbine generating equipment were independently designed by Shanghai's electrical machinery industry, absorbing new technologies from home and abroad, and have many unique features in their structure. For example, the 280-ton boiler manufactured by the Shanghai Boiler Factory in March for use with the 50,000 kilowatt steam turbine, due to the adoption of a new design, is not only highly efficient but also greatly saves steel. Compared with the 65-ton boiler previously trial-manufactured by the factory, the evaporation capacity has increased fourfold, the metal material has only increased twofold, and fuel can be saved during use. The steam turbine generator manufactured by the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant has undergone major improvements in both mechanical structure and electrical performance, and the materials used are greatly reduced compared to steam turbine generators of the same capacity.

During the trial manufacture, the factory workers exerted their utmost effort, worked diligently and cleverly, greatly accelerating the speed of trial production. The manufacturing cycle of the 280-ton boiler was twenty-one days faster than the boiler factory's previous production of the first large 15-ton boiler. The trial manufacture of the 50,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator took less than two months, also shortening the cycle by 70 to 80 percent compared to the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant's trial manufacture of the first 6,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator four years ago.

### 上海制成五万瓩汽轮电机

    上海制成五万瓩汽轮电机
    新华社上海22日电　上海电机厂制成一台五万瓩汽轮发电机，经过一系列试验，证明性能完全符合要求。至此，五万瓩的成套火力发电设备的三大主机——汽轮机、汽轮发电机和电站锅炉都在上海制成了。
    这套五万瓩汽轮发电设备的三大主机，是上海电机工业吸收国内外的新技术自行设计的，在结构上具有很多特点。例如上海锅炉厂3月份试造成功的供五万瓩汽轮机配套用的二百八十吨锅炉，由于采用了新的设计，不仅效率高，而且可以大大节约钢材，和这个厂以前试造的六十五吨锅炉比较，蒸发量增加了四倍，金属材料只增加了两倍，并且在使用时能节省燃料。上海电机厂制成的汽轮发电机，在机械结构和电气性能上都作了重大改进，所用材料比同容量的汽轮发电机大大减少。
    试制中，各厂职工鼓足干劲，苦干巧干，使试制速度大大加快。二百八十吨锅炉的制造周期，比锅炉厂过去生产的第一台大十五吨锅炉快了二十一天。五万瓩汽轮发电机的试制前后不到两个月，也比电机厂四年前试制第一台六千瓩汽轮发电机的周期缩短了百分之七、八十。
