Expanded Processing Range, Increased Automation
"Building Block" Machine Tools Become More Agile

(Our newspaper, Harbin, 19th dispatch) The Harbin Machine Tool Joint Factory, the creator of "building block" machine tools, in the movement against right-leaning tendencies, to boost morale, and vigorously increase production and practice economy, has adhered to large-scale mass-based technical innovation and technical revolution, further developing "building block" machine tools towards "three-izations" and "four-degrees." The "three-izations" are: multi-functionalization of machine tool use, generalization of components, and automation of movement; the "four-degrees" are: improving the speed of machine tool operation, the angle and rigidity of the tool, and the precision of the product.

In the past, "building block" machine tools could only be applied to mechanical processing areas such as turning, boring, and milling. Now, it has surpassed the past range and begun to be applied to other types of work. The riveting and welding workshop cooperated with fitters to trial-produce a "building block" pipe bending machine using "building block" machine tool components, changing the manual hot bending of steel pipes. This workshop also created a "building block" edge milling machine to replace pneumatic chisels for milling steel plate welds, which not only improved efficiency but also quality. The assembly workshop has also gained a lot by using "building block" machine tools to replace some fitter processes.

In terms of movement automation of "building block" machine tools, in the past, in addition to the rotation of the machine tool itself, transmission and fixed tool positioning relied on manual operation. Fitter Group 4 of the Machine Tool Joint Factory used the original "building block" vertical lathe and gear milling machines, and added automatic transmission devices to create a "building block" spiral milling machine, which has very high processing efficiency. Machining workshop lathe operators Jiang Qi'en and Li Jijing successfully created "crescent-shaped" and "fan-shaped" automatic feed "building block" lathes, creating conditions for one lathe operator to simultaneously watch several machine tools.

In addition, the Machine Tool Joint Factory also collaborated with the Harbin Institute of Technology to trial-produce a set of "building block" machine tools that meet the "three-izations and four-degrees" standards, based on summarizing the experience of Machine Tool Joint Factory workers in creating "building block" machine tools. This set of machine tools includes thirteen components: flat guide rails, vertical machines, gearboxes, feed boxes, boring and milling heads, vertical milling heads, spindles, etc., which can be assembled into five types of machine tools such as horizontal lathes, boring and milling combined machine tools, single-arm milling machines, single-machine milling machines, and herringbone gear milling machines. It can be used freely to process large products like the 650 rolling mill, and has multiple uses such as turning outer diameters, boring holes, milling side surfaces, milling herringbone gears, and planes with slopes.

### 加工范围扩大　自动化程度提高  “积木式”机床更灵巧了

    加工范围扩大　自动化程度提高
    “积木式”机床更灵巧了
    本报哈尔滨19电　创造“积木式”机床的哈尔滨机联机械厂，在反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的运动中，坚持大搞群众性的技术革新和技术革命，使“积木式”机床又进一步向着“三化”“四度”发展。“三化”是：机床使用多能化，部件通用化、运动自动化；“四度”是：提高机床运转的速度，刀具的角度、刚度，产品的精密度。
    去年积木式机床仅能应用于车、镗、铣等机械加工的范围。现在，超越了过去的范围，开始应用于其他工种。铆焊车间与钳工合作利用“积木式”机床部件试制“积木式”煨管机，改变了用人工热弯钢管的操作方法。这个车间还创制了“积木式”铣边机，代替风铲铣钢板焊口，不仅提高效率，而且质量好。装备车间利用“积木式”机床来代替部分钳工工序，也有很大的收获。
    在“积木式”机床的运动自动化方面，过去除机床自身转动外，传动和定刀都依靠手动。机联厂的钳工四组利用原有“积木式”立车和齿轮铣等机床，增添了自动化的传动装置做成“积木式”螺旋铣床，加工效率很高。机械加工车间车工姜奇恩和李继敬创造成功的“月牙型”和“扇形”自动走刀的“积木式”车床，为一个车工同时看几台机床创造了条件。
    此外，机联机械厂还与哈尔滨工业大学协作，在总结机联工人们创造“积木式”机床经验的基础上试制出一套符合“三化、四度”标准的“积木式”机床。这套机床包括：平导轨、立机、变速箱、走刀箱、镗铣头、立铣头、主轴等十三个部件，可以拼搭成卧车、镗铣联合机床、单臂铣床、单机铣床及人字齿轮铣等五种机床。它可以运用自如地加工像650轧钢机那样的大型产品，具有车外径、镗孔、铣侧面、铣人字齿轮及带有斜坡的平面等多种用途。
