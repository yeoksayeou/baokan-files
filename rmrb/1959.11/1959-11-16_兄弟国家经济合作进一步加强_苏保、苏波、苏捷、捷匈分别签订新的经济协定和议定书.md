    根据这些协定，苏保两国将进一步大大扩大两国的贸易额和经济合作。两国的换货额在1960年将大大超过今年，而达到二十三亿卢布。而1961—1965年期间，两国的对外贸易额将超过已往五年50％、到1965年则要比1958年增加60％以上。
    根据签定的协定，苏联将大大增加对保加利亚国民经济所必须的商品的供应，特别是工业设备、拖拉机、农业机器、汽车、黑色金属和有色金属、石油制品、棉花、肥料等商品的供应。苏联将对保加利亚准备建设的石油加工工厂供应原油。
    协定规定，苏联将向保加利亚提供技术援助，帮助它在克雷米科夫齐建设年产一百万吨钢材的冶金联合企业，帮助它扩建列宁冶金工厂和硫盐酸纤维素工厂以及新的水电站和其他工业项目。
    在另一方面，保加利亚将向苏联提供有色金属精矿、重晶石、某些类型的船只、农业机器和烟草、服装、皮鞋、家具等商品。
    新华社讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联和波兰6日在莫斯科签订了1960年两国换货议定书。议定书规定把两国贸易额增加到三十亿卢布以上。
