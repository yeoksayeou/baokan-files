    Moving into a new home
    Bugu
    New home is good, moving into a new home,
    Joy fills the village front and back.
    Lacquered doors, glass windows,
    Green mountains, clear waters, beautiful scenery.
    You are happy, I am busy,
    Grandpa and Grandma are overjoyed;
    Grandpa says: "I'm finally enjoying good fortune in this life!"
    Grandma says: "We got married in a broken cave dwelling."
    Everyone laughs and shouts:
    "Let's have another wedding after moving into the new house!"
    Chairman Mao's portrait hangs on the wall,
    A vase of peonies is offered to the Central Committee.
    Old groom, old bride,
    Spring is always here, flowers are always fragrant:
    The People's Commune brings much happiness,
    White hair turns black with boundless joy.

    搬新房
    布谷
    新房好，搬新房，
    村前村后喜洋洋。
    油漆门，玻璃窗，
    山青水绿好风光。
    你也乐，我也忙，
    乐坏了大爷和大娘；
    大爷说：“今生总算享了福！”
    大娘说：“咱俩破窑洞拜的堂。”
    大伙笑嚷嚷：
    “搬进新房再拜堂！”
    毛主席像挂墙上，
    一瓶牡丹献中央。
    老新郎，老新娘，
    春常在，花常香：
    人民公社幸福多，
    白发转青乐无疆。
