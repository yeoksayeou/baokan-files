    Forward! New Departments
    In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, many schools established numerous new departments and specializations.

    Establishing a new department or specialization is no easy task. Although the new departments and specializations established last year encountered difficulties, they grew rapidly in a short period of time. The most important experience here is the genuine implementation of the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor. Because of this, the newly established departments and specializations were able to obtain extensive assistance from scientific research institutions and factories and enterprises; because of this, teachers and students in the newly established departments and specializations were able to muster full enthusiasm and overcome all the difficulties in establishing the departments.

    Establishing new departments and specializations is a good thing. However, when establishing them, the conditions of each school and the needs of national construction must be considered, so that truly needed specializations can be established and gradually develop in a sound manner. Although the newly established departments and specializations have achieved certain successes on the road forward, they are still very young and therefore need to continue to work hard and move forward.

    前进吧！新的科系
    在1958年大跃进中，许多学校开设了不少新的科系和专业。
    建立一个新的科系专业，是一件很不容易的事。去年新建立的这些科系和专业，虽然也曾经遇到困难，但它们却在很短时期内就成长起来。这里面，最重要的一条经验，就是真正贯彻了党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。因为这样，新建的科系和专业才会广泛地取得科学研究机关和工厂企业部门的协助，因为这样，新建科系和专业的教师和学生，才会鼓足干劲，战胜建系中间的一切困难。
    建立新的科系和专业，这是一件好事。但是，在建立的时候，一定要考虑到各个学校的条件和国家建设事业中的需要，这样才会真正建立起切合需要的专业，并使它们逐步走上健全发展的道路。新建的科系和专业，虽然在前进的道路上取得一定成就，但它们毕竟还很年轻，因此还需要继续努力前进。
