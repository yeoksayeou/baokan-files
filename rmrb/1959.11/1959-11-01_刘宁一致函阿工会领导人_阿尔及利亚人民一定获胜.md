    Liu Ningyi Sends Letter to Algerian Trade Union Leader
    The Algerian People Will Surely Triumph
    Xinhua News Agency, 31st – On the eve of the sixth year (November 1st) of the Algerian people's armed struggle for national independence, Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, wrote a letter to Ma Shu, Secretary of the Foreign Representative Delegation of the General Union of Algerian Workers. The full text of the letter is as follows: Dear Comrade Ma Shu:
    As the Algerian people's armed struggle against French colonialism and for national independence enters its sixth year, I would like to extend my highest respect to the heroic Algerian workers and people on behalf of the Chinese workers.
    In the past five years of heroic struggle, the Algerian people have severely struck at French colonialism and annihilated a large number of French invading troops. The heroic Algerian National Liberation Army has become stronger and stronger, growing from thousands to over one hundred thousand, becoming an invincible force. The Algerian people's tenacious struggle has greatly inspired the national liberation movements in Asian and African countries. The Chinese people greatly admire the Algerian people's determination to persist in the anti-colonialist struggle and are proud of the victories achieved by the Algerian people.
    Historical experience has repeatedly proven that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. We firmly believe that with the sympathy and support of the people of the world, the Algerian people will surely drive French imperialism out of Algeria and finally achieve victory in national independence.
    With brotherly greetings
        Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
                        Liu Ningyi

    刘宁一致函阿工会领导人
    阿尔及利亚人民一定获胜
    新华社31日讯　中华全国总工会主席刘宁一在阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的武装斗争进入第六年（11月1日）的前夕，写信给阿尔及利亚工人总联合会驻外代表团书记处书记马舒。信件全文如下：亲爱的马舒同志：
    当阿尔及利亚人民反对法国殖民主义、争取民族独立的武装斗争进入第六年之际，我谨代表中国工人向英勇的阿尔及利亚工人和人民致以崇高的敬意。
    在五年来的英勇斗争中，阿尔及利亚人民沉重地打击了法国殖民主义，歼灭了大批法国侵略军。英勇的阿尔及利亚民族解放军越战越强，从数千人发展到十多万人，成为一支不可战胜的力量。阿尔及利亚人民的顽强斗争大大地鼓舞了亚非各国的民族解放运动。中国人民十分钦佩阿尔及利亚人民坚持反殖民主义斗争的决心，并且为阿尔及利亚人民所取得的胜利感到骄傲。
    历史经验再三证明帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。我们深信阿尔及利亚人民在世界人民的同情和支持下，一定能把法帝国主义从阿尔及利亚赶出去，最后取得民族独立的胜利。
    致兄弟般的敬意
        中华全国总工会主席
                        刘宁一
