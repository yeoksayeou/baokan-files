Advancing Towards New Technology with Unyielding Determination
——The Advanced Deeds of the Huainan Bijia Hill Hydraulic Coal Mining Mine

The world's most advanced coal mining method—hydraulic coal mining—has blossomed and borne fruit in the Bijia Hill Hydraulic Coal Mining Mine in Huainan, Anhui. This mine has already overfulfilled its annual production task by one hundred and five days, and entered 1960 with a heroic pace in September this year.

This hydraulic coal mining mine was built during the Great Leap Forward last year. Although it has been in production for less than a year, it has fully demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of hydraulic coal mining. From January to September this year, it produced 188,000 tons of raw coal, and the average monthly output of the recovery working face reached more than 22,000 tons. The consumption of pit props per thousand tons of coal mined is less than one-tenth of that of "dry mining" (referring to general mechanized mining); the efficiency per worker is nearly twice that of "dry mining"; and the cost per ton of coal is only one-third of that of "dry mining."

Hydraulic coal mining is a revolution in coal mining technology, and to revolutionize is to struggle. The birth of the Bijia Hill Hydraulic Coal Mining Mine was achieved by constantly overcoming various right-leaning conservative ideas and constantly overcoming various technical difficulties.

When the Bijia Hill Hydraulic Coal Mining Mine began production, the bearings of the coal-water pumps were often burned out, and they had to be stopped after running for a few minutes. The dewatering screen also failed to separate the coal and water as required. As a result, in October last year, the average daily output was only six tons of coal. Under these circumstances, some people developed a fear of difficulties, believing that "hydraulic coal mining is a world-class cutting-edge technology and cannot be mastered in a short time," and that "conditions are not ripe, so wait a while before doing it." Some activists who originally supported hydraulic coal mining also lacked confidence. Some people, seeing some difficulties in production, took the opportunity to pour cold water on the masses, saying, "Hydraulic mining is good, hydraulic mining is good, but the machines are difficult to master, and coal is hard to get. Regardless of whether it is advanced or not, dry mining is more reliable," advocating a quick "dismounting." In response to these ideological situations, the Mining Bureau and the Mining Party Committee vigorously grasped political and ideological work, vigorously publicizing the superiority of hydraulic coal mining, strengthening confidence, and correcting unhealthy tendencies. At the same time, they mobilized the broad masses to launch a debate, criticizing various erroneous ideas such as the "truce theory" and the "dismounting theory," thereby unifying thinking and raising awareness, allowing hydraulic coal mining to take root among the masses.

Hydraulic coal mining is a new technology, and there are indeed some relatively difficult technical problems to solve. For example, the coal-water pump bearings overheat and are often burned out, and coal blocks block the coal-water pipes and chutes. At that time, there was no relatively complete and mature experience in China, and it was only possible to rely on continuous research and experimentation to solve them. Under these circumstances, there were two paths in front of this mine: one was to liberate the mind, break superstitions, boldly experiment, mobilize the masses, and overcome all difficulties; the other was to bow to difficulties, "dismount" on the spot, and abandon "hydraulic mining" for "dry mining." The Mining Party Committee chose the former path, with the Party Secretary taking personal command, fully mobilizing the masses, focusing on the four key technical aspects of "coal falling, transportation, hoisting, and dewatering," thinking of solutions, formulating measures, going deep into the front line, conducting investigations and research, and organizing technical teams combining leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and veteran workers to conduct specialized research and tireless experimentation. Veteran worker Sun Jinfa and others put forward a rationalization proposal to modify the bearings of the coal-water pump to the outside of the pump casing, and conducted dozens of research and reforms, finally solving this problem, enabling the coal-water pump to maintain continuous operation for about eighteen hours. After April this year, the monthly operating time was more than 400 hours, and in August it reached more than 500 hours. The four key technologies of hydraulic coal mining were broken through one by one in such arduous struggles. Therefore, production increased steadily and production gradually became normalized. The average daily output in the first quarter of this year was 202 tons, which reached 751 tons in the second quarter, and further increased to 1,112 tons in the third quarter. The average daily output in the third quarter increased by 4.5 times compared with the first quarter. Now, the workers all praised and said: "Hydraulic coal mining is really good, the cost is low, the efficiency is high, the safety environment is greatly improved, the water gun opens and the coal wall collapses, the coal and water become a river with滔滔 waves. With this magic weapon of hydraulic mining, the output will definitely increase day by day."

All the staff and workers of the Huainan Bijia Hill Coal Mine deeply launched the red flag competition movement of learning from pace-setters and catching up with pace-setters, setting off a greater production upsurge. The average daily output in September increased by 23% compared with August, and it won the honorary title of an advanced collective in socialist construction.

    百折不回向新技术进军
    ——淮南毕家岗水力采煤矿井的先进事迹
    世界最先进的采煤法——水力采煤，在安徽淮南煤矿毕家岗水力采煤矿井开了花结了果。这个矿井已经提前一百零五天完成了全年的生产任务，今年9月份就以豪迈的步伐跨入了1960年。
    这个水力采煤矿井，是在去年大跃进中建成的。虽然投入生产不到一年，但已充分显示出水力采煤的无比优越性。今年1至9月份生产原煤十八万八千吨，回采工作面平均月产量达到二万二千多吨。每采千吨煤的坑木消耗量不足“旱采”（指一般机械化矿井采煤）的十分之一；每工效率将近“旱采”的一倍；每吨煤成本只有“旱采”的三分之一。
    水力采煤是采煤技术上的革命，要革命就要进行斗争。毕家岗水力采煤矿井的诞生，就是在不断战胜形形色色的右倾保守思想，不断战胜技术上的种种困难成长起来的。
    毕家岗水力采煤矿井在开始生产的时候，煤水泵的轴承经常被烧坏，开动几分钟就要停下来；脱水筛也不能按照要求把煤和水分开，因而去年10月份，平均一天只生产六吨煤。在这种情况下，有的人产生了畏难情绪，认为“水力采煤是世界尖端技术，一时掌握不了”，“条件不具备，等一等再干”。原来拥护水力采煤的积极分子，有的也信心不足了。也有人看到生产中的一些困难，就趁机给群众大泼冷水，说什么“水采好，水采好，机器难掌握，煤炭搞不到，不管先进不先进，还是旱采较牢靠”，主张赶快“下马”。矿务局和矿党委针对这些思想情况，大抓政治思想工作，一面大力宣传水力采煤的优越性，坚定信心，整掉歪风；一面发动广大群众，展开鸣放辩论，批判了“休战论”、“下马论”等各种错误思想，从而统一了思想，提高了认识。使水力采煤在群众中扎下了根。
    水力采煤是新技术，确实有一些比较难解决的技术问题。例如，煤水泵的轴承发热，经常烧坏，煤块堵住煤水管和溜槽堵塞等问题，当时在国内还没有比较完整的成熟经验，只有依靠自己不断地研究、试验解决。在这种情况下，摆在这个矿井面前的是两条道路：一条是解放思想，破除迷信，大胆进行试验，发动群众，战胜一切困难；另一条是向困难低头，就此“下马”，舍“水采”而改“旱采”。矿党委选择了前一条道路，由党委书记亲自挂帅，充分发动群众，围绕“落煤、运输、提升、脱水”四大技术关键，想办法，订措施；深入现场，调查研究，组织领导干部、工程技术人员和老工人相结合的技术小组，进行专门的研究，不懈地进行试验。老工人孙金发等提出了把煤水泵的轴承改装到泵壳外面的合理化建议，进行了数十次的研究和改革，终于解决了这一问题，使煤水泵能保持连续运转十八小时左右。今年4月份以后，每月运转的时间都在四百小时以上，8月份又达到五百小时以上。水力采煤的四大技术关键，就在这样艰苦的斗争中，一个一个地被他们突破了。因而，产量节节上升，生产逐步走向正常化。今年第一季度的平均日产量是二百零二吨，第二季度就达到七百五十一吨，第三季度又提高到一千一百一十二吨，第三季度的平均日产量比第一季度提高了四点五倍。现在，工人们都称赞说：“水力采煤真正好，成本低，效率高，安全环境大改善，水枪一开煤壁倒，煤水成河浪滔滔。有了水采这法宝，定叫产量日日高。”
    淮南毕家岗煤矿的全体职工，深入开展了学标兵、赶标兵的红旗竞赛运动，掀起了更大的生产高潮，9月份的平均日产量又比8月份提高了23％，获得了社会主义建设先进集体的光荣称号。
