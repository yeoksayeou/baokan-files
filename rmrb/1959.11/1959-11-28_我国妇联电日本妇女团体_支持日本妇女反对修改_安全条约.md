    Xinhua News Agency, 27th. The All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China today sent a telegram to the All-Japan Federation of Women's Organizations and the National Conference to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," expressing the full support of Chinese women for the struggle of Japanese women and the people against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    The telegram said that the struggle waged by the Japanese people for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality is supported by the peace-loving people of Asia and the world. With the strong unity and persistent struggle of the Japanese people, U.S. imperialism will surely suffer a shameful defeat. The Japanese people will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve final victory.
