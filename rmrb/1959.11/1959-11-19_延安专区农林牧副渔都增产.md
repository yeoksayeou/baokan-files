Yan'an Special Zone Achieves Increased Production in Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, Sideline Occupations, and Fisheries
    Although this year experienced spring drought and autumn floods, with 580,000 mu of farmland suffering from natural disasters and over 90,000 mu yielding no harvest, the per-mu yield of grain in the entire region still increased by more than 11% compared to last year. Over the past year, commodity production in the region has greatly developed, and this year a large amount of grain, pigs, sheep, fresh eggs, vegetables, and fruits have been transferred out to meet the needs of other regions.

    Yan'an, November 18th (report from this newspaper) - The heroic people of Yan'an Special Zone, continuing to carry forward the glorious tradition of hard work, have fully utilized the superiority of the People's Communes and achieved an all-around bumper harvest in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries this year, building on the great leap forward of 1958.

    This year, Yan'an Special Zone experienced drought followed by flooding. In spring, there were more than 80 days without a thorough rain, and in autumn it suffered unprecedented heavy rains. 580,000 mu of farmland suffered from floods, hail, frost and other disasters, of which more than 90,000 mu yielded no harvest. However, thanks to the hard work of the vast number of farmers, the per-mu yield of grain (averaged including disaster-stricken fields) still increased by 11.8% compared to last year. The average grain yield per agricultural person in the entire special zone reached 1,029 jin, and many large areas of high-yield fields emerged. At the same time, an all-around bumper harvest was achieved in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. The total output value of grain and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries from January to September this year increased by 21% compared to the same period last year. Spring afforestation increased by 42% compared to the same period last year, and 53,100+ cubic meters of timber were harvested from January to September. The number of large livestock has grown to 282,100+ head, an increase of 19,700+ head compared to the end of last year. The number of sheep increased by 44% compared to the end of last year; the number of pigs increased by 47% compared to the end of last year; and the number of chickens more than doubled compared to the end of last year. The income from sideline occupations from January to September averaged 10.06 yuan per person in the entire special zone, more than double the same period last year. Fish farming, which used to be a blank in this special zone, stocked more than 330,000 fish fry this year. The larger of these fish fry have grown to one chi (approximately 1/3 meter), and the smaller ones are 6-7 cun (approximately 20cm). Other sideline occupations such as beekeeping, rabbit breeding, and silkworm rearing have also made great progress.

    With the all-around increase in agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries production, public accumulation, member income, and commodity production have all greatly increased. According to statistics from Yichuan, Luochuan, and Huangling counties, the income of 90% of the members increased this year, and public accumulation increased by 40% compared to last year. However, the people of the old revolutionary base areas are still diligent and thrifty, actively saving. According to statistics from Zhidan County, the total savings in the county has increased by 150% compared to the same period last year; the savings of Gaoqiao Commune in Yan'an County has increased by 175% compared to the same period last year. The vast number of members also sell a large amount of production fruits to the state, increasing the supply of commodities. This year, the entire special zone has transferred out more than 27.5 million jin of grain, more than 32,900 pigs, more than 29,900 sheep, more than 679,000 jin of fresh eggs, more than 650,000 jin of wool, more than 129,000 animal skins, and more than 1,699,000 jin of vegetables and fresh and dried fruits.

    In the most difficult years of China's revolutionary struggle, the people of Yan'an, under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, worked hard, relied on their own efforts, overcame all kinds of difficulties, and actively supported the revolutionary war. After the victory, the people of Yan'an, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of people from all over the country, quickly healed the wounds of war, and by 1952, grain and other agricultural products had reached self-sufficiency. During the construction period, the people of Yan'an followed Chairman Mao's teachings, "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," further organized themselves, and launched a heroic and tenacious struggle against nature. In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward of 1958 and the people's commune movement, the entire special zone has drawn 5.5% of the total labor force to form a year-round agricultural capital construction army, opening up mountains and splitting rocks, and vigorously carrying out agricultural capital construction, which has greatly changed the appearance of the mountainous areas. From last year to now, the entire special zone has built more than 500,000 mu of irrigated land, more than six times the amount built in the past. In the past, there was very little rice, but last year it developed to 30,000 mu, and this year it has increased to 40,000 mu. More than 130,000 mu of terraced fields have been built, together with various field projects such as soft embankments, silt dams, and afforestation, controlling soil erosion in an area of more than 7,000 square kilometers, accounting for about 30% of the area with soil erosion. In the construction of these projects, the people of Yan'an overcame all kinds of difficulties. For example, the Yan-Hui Canal, which is more than 100 li long, has 21 large stone piers, each 1,000 meters long and 15 meters high, and two tunnels, each 100 meters long, along the way. More than 50% of the stone work has been completed. Lacking cement in construction, they finally made it after more than 20 experiments, producing 225 tons successively, achieving self-sufficiency. Lacking gunpowder, they made their own saltpeter and charcoal to make gunpowder. Now, each construction site has achieved self-sufficiency in 12 important items such as cement, lime, gunpowder, and vegetables.

    While vigorously carrying out agricultural capital construction, this special zone has conscientiously implemented the production policy of multiple cropping and large-scale high-yield production, and implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production increase according to local conditions, especially grasping the important links of water, soil, fertilizer, density, and management, as well as a series of field management tasks. In the past, the entire special zone rarely autumn-tilled the land, but more than 70% of this year's autumn fields were tilled last autumn, of which nearly 1 million mu were deep-tilled to about one chi (33cm); the amount of fertilizer applied to crops has also increased by nearly two times compared to previous years, and reasonable close planting has been universally implemented, laying the foundation for a bumper harvest. In order to overcome various natural disasters, the people of the entire special zone united and supported each other. According to statistics, the number of urban and rural, mountain and plain mutual support and cooperation in disaster resistance in the entire special zone this year reached more than 500,000 person-times, turning serious disasters into minor disasters, and minor disasters into no disasters. In Zhidan County, 40% of the autumn fields in Zhoujiawan Commune were washed away by floods in a rainstorm, and the communes in non-disaster areas helped them support seedlings and replant. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the people of this special zone were even more enthusiastic and launched a large-scale autumn field overproduction movement. In previous years, the autumn fields were generally hoeed only once or twice, but this year more than 40% were hoeed three times or more; plus the fast harvesting and careful threshing in the autumn harvest, a bumper harvest was achieved. The people of Yan'an can always maintain this spirit of hard work, which is inseparable from the constant ideological education of cadres and the masses by the Party organizations in the Yan'an area. As early as when the agricultural secretary meeting was held last winter to formulate this year's production plan, the meeting promptly criticized the complacency expressed by some cadres. At the enlarged meeting of the prefectural committee held in April this year, the above-mentioned ideas were further criticized, so the vast number of cadres led the masses to maintain soaring enthusiasm from beginning to end, which played a decisive role in this year's bumper harvest.

    After the autumn harvest, the Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately launched an education campaign throughout the region to build the country and manage households diligently and thriftily, educating the masses to live a rich life as if it were a poor life, and calling on the people of the entire special zone to plant a large amount of vegetables and save as much grain as possible. At present, the average household in the entire special zone has stored about 40 jin of dried vegetables. Leading cadres at all levels have also inherited the glorious tradition of hard work and plain living of the cadres in the old revolutionary base areas, often going deep into the countryside, participating in production, and leading production. Since this year, in various production movements, 80% to 90% of the cadres in the entire special zone have gone deep into the fields to lead production. According to statistics, the cadres in this special zone generally have three farm tools. Whenever they go to the countryside or go up the mountains, they bring these farm tools with them, and when they get there, they immediately participate in production.

    延安专区农林牧副渔都增产
    今年虽然春旱秋涝，五十八万亩田遭受自然灾害，九万多亩全无收成，但全区粮食亩产量仍比去年增长百分之十一以上。一年来，全区商品生产有很大发展，今年已调出大量粮食、猪、羊、鲜蛋、蔬菜、水果，供应外区需要。
    本报延安18日电　英雄的延安专区人民，继续发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，充分利用人民公社的优越性，在1958年大跃进的基础上，今年又取得了农林牧副渔全面丰收。
    延安专区今年先旱后涝，春天有八十多天没有下过透雨，秋季又遭受多年未有的暴雨，五十八万亩田禾遭到了水冲、雹打、霜冻等灾害，其中九万多亩全无收成。但是，在广大农民的艰苦奋战下，粮食亩产（包括受灾田在内平均）仍然比去年增长了11.8％，全专区每个农业人口平均达到一千零二十九斤粮食，并且出现了许多大面积丰产田。同时，还取得了农林牧副渔全面大丰收。今年全年粮食和1至9月林牧副渔的总产值，比去年同期增长了21％。春季造林比去年同期增加42％，1至9月采伐木材五万三千一百多立方米；大牲畜已发展到二十八万二千一百多头，比去年年底增加一万九千七百多头；羊比去年年底增加44％；猪比去年年底增加47％；鸡比去年年底增加一倍以上。1至9月的副业收入，全专区每人平均达到十元零六分，比去年同期增加两倍以上。养鱼事业在这个专区以往还是空白，今年放养了三十三万多尾鱼苗，这些渔苗大的已长到一尺，小的也有六、七寸。其他养蜂、养兔、养蚕等副业也都有了很大发展。
    在农林牧副渔全面增产的情况下，公共积累、社员收入和商品生产都有了很大增长。据宜川、洛川、黄陵三县统计，今年90％的社员增加了收入，公共积累比去年增加了40％。但是，老区人民仍然克勤克俭，积极储蓄。据志丹县统计，全县目前的储蓄额比去年同期提高了150％；延安县高桥公社今年的储蓄额比去年同期提高了175％。广大社员还把大量的生产果实卖给国家，增加商品供应量。今年全专区已外调粮食二千七百五十多万斤，猪三万二千九百多头，羊二万九千九百多只，鲜蛋六十七万九千多斤，绒毛六十五万多斤，兽皮十二万九千多张，蔬菜和干鲜果一百六十九万九千多斤。
    在我国革命斗争最艰苦的年代里，延安人民在党中央、毛主席的直接领导下，艰苦奋斗，自力更生，克服了种种困难，积极支援革命战争。胜利以后，延安人民又在党的领导和各地人民的支援下，迅速地医治好战争创伤，到1952年粮食等农产品就达到了自给。在建设时期，延安人民又遵照毛主席的教导，“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，进一步组织起来，向大自然展开了英勇的顽强的斗争。几年来，特别是1958年大跃进和人民公社化以来，全专区抽调了占总劳力5.5％的常年农田基本建设大军，开山劈石，大搞农田基本建设，使得山区面貌有了很大改观。去年到现在，全专区已兴修水地五十多万亩，比过去历年来所修水地扩大了六倍多。过去很少有水稻，去年发展到三万亩，今年又增加到四万亩。兴修水平梯田十三万多亩，连同软埝、淤泥坝和造林等各种田间工程，共控制水土流失面积七千多平方公里，占水土流失面积的30％左右。在兴修这些工程中，延安人民克服了种种困难。如全长一百多华里的延惠渠，沿途打通二十一道一千米长、十五米高的大石砭和两个一百米长的隧洞，石方工程也完成了50％以上。在施工中缺乏水泥，他们经过二十多次的试验，终于制成了，先后生产了二百二十五吨，达到自给。缺乏火药，他们就自己动手熬硝，烧木炭，制造火药。现在，各工地已经在水泥、白灰、火药、蔬菜等十二个重要项目上实现了自给。
    这个专区在大搞农田基本建设的同时，认真执行了多种多收和大面积高额丰产的生产方针，因地制宜地贯彻了农业增产“八字宪法”，特别是抓住了水、土、肥、密、管这样几项重要环节和一系列的田间管理工作。全专区过去很少秋翻地，今年的秋田70％以上都是去年秋季翻过的，其中将近一百万亩深翻达一尺左右；农作物的施肥量也比往年增加了将近两倍，并且普遍实行了合理密植，为丰收奠定了基础。为了战胜各种自然灾害，全专区人民同心同德，互相展开了支援。据统计，全专区今年城乡、山川互相支援协作抗灾的人次达五十万以上，使重灾变成了轻灾，轻灾变成了无灾。志丹县周家湾公社在一次暴雨中，40％的秋田遭到了洪水的冲刷，非灾区各公社便帮助他们扶苗、翻种。在党的八届八中全会以后，这个专区的人民更是干劲冲天，大搞秋田超产运动。往年秋田一般只锄一次至两次，今年锄三次的达到40％以上；加上秋收中的快收细打，做到了丰产丰收。延安人民能够经常保持这种艰苦奋斗精神，是和延安地区党组织经常不断地对干部和群众进行思想教育分不开的。早在去年冬季召开的农业书记会议上制订今年生产计划时，会议对一部分干部流露出的自满情绪，就及时地进行了批判。在今年4月间召开的地委扩大会议上，又对上述思想继续进行了批判，因而广大干部带领群众自始至终都保持了冲天的干劲，这对今年的大丰收起了决定的作用。
    秋季丰收后，中共延安地委立即在全区开展了勤俭建国、勤俭持家的教育，教育群众把富日子当穷日子过，号召全专区人民大量种菜，尽量节约粮食。目前全专区平均每户已储干菜四十斤左右。各级领导干部也都继承了老区干部艰苦朴素的光荣传统，经常深入农村，参加生产和领导生产。今年以来，在各个生产运动中，全专区有80％至90％的干部深入到田间领导生产。据统计，这个专区的干部一般都有三件农具，每逢下乡上山，他们都带上这些农具，到那里，就立即在那里参加生产。
