Simultaneous Leap Forward in Agriculture and Animal Husbandry
    Investigation of Ping'an People's Commune in Da'an County, Jilin

    Every Spring Festival, the farmers of Ping'an Township in Da'an County paste red couplets with "Abundant Harvest of Grains" and "Flourishing Livestock" to express their wishes for a better life. However, it was not until the establishment of the People's Commune that this wish began to become a reality.

    Abundant Harvest of Grains, Flourishing Livestock

    In the first year after its establishment, the Ping'an People's Commune achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in agriculture and animal husbandry. Grain production increased by 36% compared to the exceptionally good year of 1958. The total number of cattle, horses, and sheep reached more than 21,700 head, an increase of 45% over the previous year; pigs increased by 20%; and poultry increased by 1.8 times. With the development of production, the quantity of commodities also increased. It has already sold 2,350 head of cattle and sheep, 800 fat pigs, and more than 53,000 jin of bristles and wool. It not only overfulfilled the state-assigned procurement tasks but also supported other regions with 120 draft horses and 20 improved breeding stallions. Last year, the output value of animal husbandry alone is expected to reach 1,138,000 yuan, an increase of 1.3 times compared to 1958, equivalent to 74% of this year's total agricultural income. Currently, the entire commune of 2,712 households has an average of 8,000 jin of grain, 4 head of large livestock, 4 sheep, 2 pigs, 4 rabbits, and 12 poultry per household. The average net income per household can reach 550 yuan, an increase of 78% compared to 1958, and the commune members generally live a life of plenty.

    Ping'an Commune is located in the western part of Jilin Province, with boundless grasslands and 120,000 mu of arable land interspersed with the grasslands. Before liberation, there were packs of wolves, animal epidemics were prevalent, and the land was barren and the people were poor. After liberation, farmers were allocated livestock and land, and production developed. However, until 1952, livestock only increased by an average of 4% per year. In 1954, on the basis of agricultural mutual aid groups, joint herds, cooperative herds, and primary agricultural-animal husbandry cooperatives were established. Sure enough, in 1955, livestock increased by 11.2% compared to the previous year. After transitioning to advanced cooperatives, some basic construction and livestock quality improvement work was carried out, and business management was improved, which made a big step forward in livestock production. In 1957, livestock increased by 13.9% compared to the previous year. The masses realized the benefits of collective management from their experience, and unanimously commented: "Collectivization means great strength, and 'fur balls' (livestock) have become 'iron crops'."

    Improving Management Makes Livestock Strong and Fat

    After the establishment of the commune, the commune Party committee, based on the summary of experience and the instructions of the Party at higher levels, put forward the policy of "equal emphasis on agriculture and animal husbandry, combining agriculture and animal husbandry" and the measures to realize the "four modernizations" of animal husbandry (professionalized management, scientific feeding, disease-free and healthy animals, and high-quality breeding). This correct policy and corresponding advanced measures were warmly supported by the majority of cadres and poor and lower-middle peasant commune members. A mass movement to love, increase, and protect livestock quickly emerged in the entire commune, and more than 1,250 "five-good" commune members who loved the commune as their home and livestock as their children emerged.

    "Professionalized management" means establishing professional management organizations, organizing professional teams, and implementing specialized and responsible grazing. In the past, when some cooperatives were busy with farm work, they used old and weak laborers to graze livestock as substitutes, which greatly affected livestock breeding work. After the establishment of the commune, due to the rapid development of collective welfare undertakings, more than 2,500 female laborers participated in agricultural and animal husbandry production, thus effectively solving the contradiction of competition for labor between agriculture and animal husbandry. The commune established 80 livestock farms according to the principle of unified leadership and hierarchical management, and implemented professionalized management. Commune members who were politically reliable, had grazing experience, loved animal husbandry, and were healthy were selected to serve as herdsmen, forming a large grazing army, so that every herd of livestock had dedicated management; the "three specializations" (specialized grazing, specialized fertilizer accumulation, specialized leadership) and "seven determinations" (determine the number of heads, determine the livestock condition, determine reproduction, determine pasture, determine forage, determine livestock sheds, determine remuneration) and "one reward" management system were implemented, so that animal husbandry personnel could be dedicated to loving and protecting livestock, fundamentally improving livestock management.

    "Scientific feeding" means building livestock sheds, rationally dividing groups, and promoting advanced grazing and feeding systems. Commune members said: "In the past, livestock lived in 'open-air pavilions,' which were big sheds in the sky and big pens on the ground. When the wind and snow came, old cattle and skinny horses had a hard time." Now, the commune has built 1,660 livestock sheds and 70 lambing rooms, and dug 25 wells, so that more than 80% of the livestock live in sheds. In terms of feeding, the backward situation of "three indistinctions" (indistinct species, male and female, strong and weak) has also been changed, and management is carried out by dividing circles, grazing in groups, and watering in groups, completely overcoming the extensive habits of scattering, free-ranging, and relying on the sky for food. The commune Party committee rationally divided the large grassland into 12 pastures, fixing hay-making areas and grazing areas. A rotation system for the rational use of pastures was adopted, and the grazing method of "grazing in depressions in spring, on ridges in summer, on shady slopes in autumn, and on sunny slopes in winter" was promoted, overcoming the phenomenon of random grazing and improving the quality of pasture.

    "Disease-free and healthy animals" means establishing a veterinary epidemic prevention network, focusing on prevention and combining prevention and treatment to ensure the healthy growth of livestock. In the past, there were many livestock diseases and high mortality rates here, which greatly threatened the development of livestock. After the establishment of the commune, a livestock school was established, which trained 67 livestock and veterinary personnel and 114 quarantine officers, and established 8 veterinary stations and clinics, so that there were stations in the commune, clinics in the management area, and quarantine officers in the production team, and implemented a system of assigning areas to each person, conducting rounds of inspections, and conducting regular quarantine, which effectively strengthened the prevention and control of livestock diseases. In the past year, anthrax, bovine contagious pleuropneumonia, foot-and-mouth disease, sheep liver fluke have been eliminated, and brucellosis, glanders, mange, and swine fever have been controlled. Since communization, the livestock loss rate has only reached 0.7%, a decrease of 73% compared to before communization, basically achieving disease-free seasons and fat and strong livestock.

    "High-quality breeding" means that female animals are not empty and are mated with excellent breeding males. In the past, there was a saying among the masses here to describe the poor reproduction of livestock: "Donkeys are mismated, horses are empty, old cows are widowed, and sheep are aborted." Now, due to the establishment of the People's Commune, unprecedentedly favorable conditions have been created for improving the reproduction rate of livestock and accelerating the improvement of livestock quality. As soon as the People's Commune was established, it used public accumulation funds to purchase 20 heads of Don horses, Dutch bulls, and Xinjiang sheep, established 25 artificial insemination stations and a livestock breeding farm, trained 190 insemination technicians, and adopted the method of simultaneously using foreign breeds and local breeds, artificial insemination and natural mating, which improved the mating technology and greatly improved the conception rate, achieving high-quality breeding.

    After the establishment of the People's Commune, due to the realization of the "four modernizations" of animal husbandry, a prosperous scene of horses producing fine foals and sheep producing four lambs has emerged. The entire commune has bred 6,980 cattle, horses, and sheep in the past year, and the breeding rate has increased by more than double compared to 1958, which is equal to the total development in 1956 and 1957.

    Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Promote Each Other

    Giving importance to agriculture while neglecting animal husbandry or abandoning agriculture for animal husbandry is a long-standing contradiction in agricultural and pastoral areas. After communization, the contradiction between agriculture and animal husbandry has been transformed into mutual promotion between agriculture and animal husbandry, realizing a double leap forward in agriculture and animal husbandry.

    "If you want to grow more grain, you can't do without cattle, horses, and sheep." This is the conclusion that commune members have drawn from their production practice experience. The increase in livestock provides favorable conditions for agriculture to implement the "Eight-Character Charter." It is estimated that the total output of grain and soybeans in 1959 will reach 22 million jin, an increase of 36% compared to the total output of the exceptionally good year of 1958, which is another unprecedented bumper harvest.

    More livestock means more deep plowing. During plowing, it was the peak of the busy autumn harvest season, and the labor force appeared to be insufficient. The commune selected 2,240 head of livestock and used the method of multiple sets of livestock, multiple sets of plows, and one set of plows and two sets of livestock to harvest and plow at the same time, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient labor. After 40 days of hard work, more than 80,000 mu of land were plowed, which is sixteen times the total of the mutual aid and cooperation period (1954 to 1957); the autumn harvest and grain delivery were also completed earlier than in previous years. More livestock means more manure fertilizer. Commune members boasted: "A herd of livestock is a fertilizer factory." In the past, fertilizer was applied every three years, but this year it was applied three times a year, realizing full fertilization and rich fertilization. This year's fertilizer application rate increased by 47% compared to 1958, turning sandbags and alkali flakes into grain bins. Without a large number of livestock, not only would there not be so much good manure, but even if there was, it would be difficult to transport it to the fields. More livestock means more cultivated land, with an average of 32 mu of cultivated land per laborer in the entire commune. It is impossible to cultivate so much land by human power alone. The commune transferred 2,472 head of livestock to reduce the labor burden on people. More livestock also strengthens the disaster resistance force. This is a place with a lot of wind and little rain (the annual evaporation is more than two and a half times the rainfall). This summer, it did not rain for 30 consecutive days, and the leaves of the crops were rolled up. The commune put livestock on the waterwheels on the wells to draw water day and night, and also drew out more than 1,400 head of livestock to pull large carts to haul water to irrigate 22,000 mu of land. Commune members said: "This year's bumper harvest is the result of the commune's role in harnessing animal power to compete with the heavens."

    The rapid development of animal husbandry is also inseparable from the support of agriculture. For example, haymaking is seasonal, and only by transferring a large number of laborers engaged in agricultural production to make hay can we ensure that sufficient feed is stored. The large amount of forage stored last autumn and this autumn was mobilized by all agricultural laborers. The construction of livestock sheds and pasture wells would not have been possible without the efforts of all commune members and the support of agricultural funds. The stalks and by-products of 120,000 mu of crops can mostly be used as feed; in addition, more than 1 million jin of grain are allocated to livestock every year as concentrated feed, which strongly promotes the development of animal husbandry.

    农牧业双双跃进
    吉林大安县平安人民公社调查
    每逢新春佳节，大安县平安乡的农民们便贴上“五谷丰登”、“六畜兴旺”的红对联，来表示自己对美好生活的愿望。但是，直到办起了人民公社，这个愿望才开始变成了现实。
    五谷丰登　六畜兴旺
    平安人民公社在成立后的第一年，就获得了农牧业空前大丰收。粮食比特大丰收的1958年增产36％。牛、马、羊的总数，发展到二万一千七百多头，比去年增长45％；猪增长了20％；家禽增长了一点八倍。随着生产的发展，商品量也增加了。现已出售菜牛和羊二千三百五十头，肥猪八百口，鬃、毛五万三千多斤。不但超额完成了国家分配的收购任务，还支援外地耕畜一百二十匹、改良种马二十匹。去年畜牧业一项的产值，预计即可达一百一十三万八千元，比1958年增加一点三倍，相当于今年农业总收入的74％。现在，全社二千七百一十二户，每户平均有粮食八千斤，大牲畜四头，羊四只，猪二口，兔四只，家禽十二只。平均每户纯收入可达五百五十元，比1958年增长78％，社员普遍过着丰衣足食的生活。
    平安公社位于吉林省的西部，境内有一望无边的大草原，又有和草原插花交错的耕地十二万亩。解放前，这里野狼成群，兽疫流行，地瘠民贫。解放后，农民分到了牲畜和土地，生产有了发展。但是，到1952年牲畜平均每年也只增长4％。1954年，在农业互助组的基础上，举办了联合牧群、合作牧群和农牧结合的初级合作社。果然不错，1955年牲畜就比上年增长了11.2％。转为高级社以后，开始搞了一些基本建设和畜质改良工作，改进了经营管理，使畜牧业生产向前迈进了一大步，1957年牲畜比上年增长13.9％。群众从体验中认识到集体经营的好处，一致的评论是：“集体化、力量大，‘毛团子’（牲畜）变成了‘铁杆庄稼’。”
    改进管理牲  畜膘肥体壮
    公社成立以后，公社党委根据经验总结和上级党的指示，提出了“农牧并重、农牧结合”的方针和实现畜牧业“四化”（管理专业化、饲养科学化、无疫健壮化、满怀良种化）的措施。这一正确的方针和相应的先进措施受到大
  多数干部和贫农、下中农社员的热烈拥护，全社很快出现了爱畜、增畜、保畜的群众运动，涌现出爱社如家、爱畜如子的“五好”社员一千二百五十多名。
    “管理专业化”，就是建立专业管理机构，组织专业队伍，实行专群、专责、专人放牧。过去有些社农活一忙，就用老弱劳动力去当替工放牧，大大影响了牲畜饲养工作。公社成立以后，因为集体福利事业的迅速发展，有二千五百多名妇女劳动力参加了农牧业生产，从而有效地解决了农牧业争劳力的矛盾。公社按照统一领导、分级管理的原则，建立起八十处畜牧场，实行了管理专业化。挑选了政治可靠、有放牧经验、热爱畜牧事业、身体健康的社员担任放牧员，组成了放牧大军，做到群群牲畜都有专人管理；推行了“三专”（专人放牧、专人积肥、专人领导）和“七定”（定头数、定畜膘、定繁殖、定牧场、定草料、定畜棚、定报酬）以及“一奖励”的管理制度，畜牧人员能够专职专心爱畜保畜，使牲畜经营管理有了根本改善。
    “饲养科学化”，就是建立畜棚，合理分群，推行先进的放牧和饲养制度。社员们说：“过去牲畜住的‘露天馆’，是天大的棚，地大的圈，一遇风雪天，老牛、瘦马难过关。”现在，公社盖成畜棚一千六百六十间，产羔室七十间，打井二十五眼，使80％以上的牲畜住上了棚。在饲养方面也改变了种类、公母、强弱“三不分”的落后状况，做到了分圈管理、分群放牧、分帮饮水，彻底克服了散撒、散放、靠天吃饭的粗放习惯。公社党委把大片草原合理划分为十二个牧场，固定了打草区和放牧区。采取了合理使用牧场的轮放制度，推行了“春放洼塘，夏放岗，秋放阴坡，冬放阳”的放牧方法，克服了乱放现象，也提高了牧草质量。
    “无疫健壮化”，就是建立兽疫防治网，以防为主，防治结合，保证牲畜健壮地成长。过去这里牲畜的疫病多，死亡率也高，对于牲畜的发展威胁很大。公社成立以后，办了一座畜牧学校，培养了六十七名畜牧、兽医人员，训练了一百一十四名防疫员，建立了八处兽医站、所，达到公社有站、管理区有所、生产队有防疫员，并且实行了分片包干、巡回检查、定期检疫等制度，有力地加强了牲畜的疫病防治工作。一年来消灭了炭疽、牛肺疫、口蹄疫、羊肝蛭和控制了布氏杆菌、鼻疽、疥癣、猪瘟等疫病。公社化以来，牲畜损失率仅达0.7％，比公社化前降低了73％，基本上达到了四季无疫，膘肥体壮。
    “满怀良种化”，就是母畜不空怀，并且用优良种公畜进行配种。过去这里群众有一句形容牲畜繁殖不旺的话：“毛驴失配，马空怀，老牛守寡，羊掉胎。”现在由于人民公社的建立，为提高牲畜繁殖率、加速畜质改良创造了前所未有的优越条件。人民公社刚一建立，就用公积金购买了顿河种马、荷兰种牛、新疆种羊等二十头，建立了二十五处人工授精配种站和一处牲畜繁育场，培养了一百九十名配种技术手，采取了外地良种和当地良种、人工授精和本交同时并举的方法，改进了配种技术，从而大大地提高了受胎率，达到了满怀化。
    人民公社成立后，由于畜牧业实现了“四化”，出现了马产良驹、羊产四羔的兴旺景象，全社一年来繁殖牛、马、羊六千九百八十头，繁殖率比1958年提高了一倍多，等于1956年和1957年两年发展的总和。
    农牧业互相促进
    重农轻牧或弃农就牧是农牧地区长久没有解决的矛盾。公社化后，农牧矛盾却转化为农牧业互相促进，实现了农牧业双双跃进。
    “要想多打粮，离不开牛马羊”，这是社员们从生产实践的经验中得出的结论。牲畜增多，给农业贯彻执行“八字宪法”提供了有利条件。预计1959年粮食、大豆总产量可达二千二百万斤，比特大丰收的1958年的总产量增加36％，又是一个空前的大丰收。
    牲畜多，深翻地多。在翻地时，正值紧张的秋收季节，劳动力显得不足。社里就选出二千二百四十头牲口，用多套牲口、多套犁杖和一副犁杖、两套牲口的办法，边收、边翻，克服了劳动力不足的困难。经过四十天的苦战，翻地八万多亩，为互助合作时期（1954年到1957年）总和的十六倍；秋收、送粮也比往年提前结束。牲畜多，粪肥多。社员夸耀地说：“一群牲口就是一个肥料厂。”过去是三年一茬粪，今年一年三茬粪，实现了满粪化和饱粪化。今年的施肥量比1958年增加47％，使沙包、碱片变成了粮食囤。没有大量的牲畜，不仅不能有这么多的好粪，就是有，要运到地里去也有困难。牲畜多，种地多，全公社每个劳动力平均三十二亩耕地。种这么多的地，光靠人力是不行的。公社就调来二千四百七十二头牲口，减轻了人的劳动负担。牲畜多，也增强了抗灾力量。这里是风多、雨少（每年蒸发量大于降雨量的两倍半）的地方，今年夏季一连三十天没有下雨，庄稼叶子都打了卷。社里就把井上的水车套上牲畜，昼夜车水，又抽出一千四百多头牲畜套大车拉水，浇了二万二千亩地。社员们说：“今年丰收是公社发挥了畜力的作用，向老天爷争来的。”
    畜牧业的迅速发展，也是和农业方面的支援分不开的。例如打草是有季节性的，只有抽调大批从事农业生产的劳动力去打草，才能保证贮备充足的饲料。去年秋天和今年秋天贮备的大量饲草，就是动员全体农业劳动力去打的。畜棚和牧井的建设，没有全体社员的努力和农业资金的支援，也是办不到的。十二万亩作物的秸棵和副产物，大部分可做饲料；此外，每年还给牲畜拨出一百多万斤粮食做精饲料，这就有力地促进了畜牧业的发展。
