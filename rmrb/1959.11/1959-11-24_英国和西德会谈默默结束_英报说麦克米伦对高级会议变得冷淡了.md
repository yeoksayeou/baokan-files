UK-West Germany Talks End Quietly
British Press Says Macmillan is Cooling Towards High-Level Meetings

(Reported by this newspaper) The three-day talks between West German Chancellor Adenauer and British Prime Minister Macmillan quietly concluded on the 19th. During these talks, both sides sought compromise and adjusted contradictions, but the results were not significant.

Not only was no communique issued after the talks, but unlike the UK-France talks, there was no joint press conference. Adenauer alone spoke to the press. According to Adenauer, he and Macmillan had a "broad exchange of views," and he shared the same "general views" with Britain on the issue of summit meetings, and their opinions on the political aspects of disarmament were in "complete agreement." At the press conference, Adenauer emphasized that the East-West summit should discuss disarmament. As for the West Berlin issue, he insisted that it could only be resolved as part of the overall German problem. This shows that Adenauer's trip was aimed at promoting ideas that would undermine the East-West summit. It is worth noting that the British official response to Adenauer's statement was one of silence, neither affirming nor denying it. According to the British "Daily Express," Britain's strategy regarding summit meetings has undergone a major change. After conceding to France and West Germany on the timing of the summit, Britain has now "reached a compromise" with Adenauer on the agenda of the summit. The British "Sunday Express" asked: Is Macmillan "cooling towards summit talks?" The newspaper also stated that after Adenauer's visit to London, "it is clear that the summit talks are more distant than before. There is no set time, and no compromise in sight."

During the talks, Adenauer also forced Britain to retreat again on the issue of establishing a Central European arms limitation zone. As a result, the two sides reached an agreement not to mention the word "separation." Macmillan had explicitly expressed his support for establishing such a zone during his visit to Moscow earlier this year. The British Labour Party's "Daily Herald" said this agreement was a "British concession." However, a United Press International dispatch from Bonn on the 20th stated that a West German spokesperson confirmed that "Britain has not unconditionally abandoned the entire plan for the so-called 'separation' of Europe."

According to Western newspapers, Britain's biggest fear is that the Bonn-Paris axis will form a continental bloc in Europe that opposes and excludes Britain. Therefore, Britain's concessions on the above issues appear to be an attempt to get West Germany to abandon the idea of forming a continental bloc against Britain, and to allow Britain to get involved in continental Western Europe. However, it is said that Adenauer only agreed that the "Western European Union" could be used for "limited" political consultations between Britain and the six countries of the "Common Market."

On the issue of the confrontation between the "Common Market" and the "Small Free Trade Area," which involves enormous conflicts of interest, the contradictions between the two sides remain the same. Before the visit, there were reports that Adenauer was prepared to make "economic concessions" to Britain in order to build a "bridge" between the "Common Market" and the "Small Free Trade Area." This was because it was said that the West German business community was worried that Britain's "Small Free Trade Area" would seize West Germany's market in the outer seven countries. However, the outcome of the talks showed that no progress was made on this issue either. When Adenauer spoke about this issue at the press conference, he only said vaguely, "We have been discussing what possibilities there are for the six countries and the seven countries to hold discussions in the future, and we will further discuss these possibilities with our respective partners."

It is worth noting that at the same time as Adenauer's visit to London, the seven countries of the "Small Free Trade Area," led by Britain, officially signed the treaty on establishing this economic group in Stockholm on the 19th. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd also said meaningfully in Parliament that the British government is fully aware of the need to defend against the "Common Market" in the interests of Britain.

Despite some compromises between Britain and West Germany in the London talks, many West German and British newspapers admitted that the talks did not actually eliminate the serious differences between the two countries. Bonn's "General-Anzeiger" said that one could guess that this "complete agreement" would last "a little longer" than the "deceptive harmony" of the Macmillan-Adenauer talks in March of this year. Britain's "Daily Telegraph" also said, "It would be wrong to conclude that the talks will greatly strengthen British-German unity."

### 英国和西德会谈默默结束  英报说麦克米伦对高级会议变得冷淡了

    英国和西德会谈默默结束
    英报说麦克米伦对高级会议变得冷淡了
    本报讯　为期三天的西德总理阿登纳和英国首相麦克米伦的会谈，已在19日默默结束。在这一次会谈中，双方都在寻求妥协、调整矛盾，但结果并不怎么大。
    双方会谈结束后不仅没有发表公报，甚至也没有像英法会谈时双方共同举行一次记者招待会，而只由阿登纳出面向新闻界讲了一通话。据阿登纳说，他同麦克米伦“广泛地交换了意见”，在最高级会议问题上，他同英国的“一般看法”是相同的，而对裁军的政治方面的意见“完全一致”。阿登纳在记者招待会上强调东西方最高级会议应当讨论裁军问题。至于西柏林问题，他坚持只能作为整个德国问题的一部分来解决。这说明阿登纳此行目的是为了推销破坏东西方高级会议的货色。值得注意的是，英国官方对阿登纳这种说法采取了既不肯定也不否认的沉默态度。而据英国“每日快报”透露：英国对最高级会议的策略已经发生了重大变化。在召开最高级会议日期问题上向法国、西德的观点让步之后，目前英国在最高级会议的议程问题上，也和阿登纳“达成了妥协”。英国“星期日快报”问道：麦克米伦是否“对最高级会谈变得冷淡起来了？”这家报纸又说：阿登纳访问伦敦以后，“显然最高级会谈比以前更加遥远了。没有确定时间，也看不到什么折衷”。
    在这次会谈中，阿登纳还迫使英国在关于建立中欧限制军备区问题上再度后退。结果双方达成协议，不提“隔离”两字。麦克米伦在今年年初访问莫斯科时曾明确表示赞成建立这样一个地区。英国工党“每日先驱报”对这个协议说，这是“英国的让步”。但是合众国际社20日从波恩发出的一则消息说，西德发言人证实，“英国没有无条件地全部放弃关于所谓欧洲‘隔离’的计划”。
    据西方报纸报道，英国目前最害怕的是波恩—巴黎轴心在欧洲组成一个反对和排斥英国的大陆集团。因此英国在上述问题上的让步，看来是企图换取西德放弃成立反对英国的大陆集团的主张，并且让英国也插手于西欧大陆。但是据说阿登纳只同意可以利用“西欧联盟”在英国同“共同市场”六国之间进行“有限度”的政治磋商。
    在关系到巨大利害冲突的“共同市场”和“小自由贸易区”对垒的问题上，双方矛盾依然如故。在访问之前，有消息说阿登纳准备对英国作出“经济让步”，以便在“共同市场”和“小自由贸易区”之间搭起“桥梁”。因为据说西德国内经济界担心英国的“小自由贸易区”会抢走西德在外部七国的市场。但是会谈结果表明，这个问题同样没有取得进展。阿登纳在记者招待会上谈到这个问题时只是泛泛地说，“我们一直在讨论六国和七国今后进行讨论会有什么可能性，我们将同我们各自的伙伴进一步讨论这种可能性。”
    值得注意的是，就在阿登纳访问伦敦的同时，以英国为首的“小自由贸易区”七国19日在斯德哥尔摩正式签订了关于建立这个经济集团的条约。英国外交大臣劳埃德还在议会中意味深长地说，英国政府完全知道为了英国的利益来防备“共同市场”。
    尽管在这次伦敦会谈中，英国和西德双方有了些妥协，但是，不少西德和英国报纸承认这次会谈实际上并未消除两国之间的严重分歧。波恩“总汇报”说，可以猜想，这次的“完全一致”能比今年3月间麦克米伦和阿登纳会谈那种“骗人的和谐”保持得“比较长久一些”。英国的“每日电讯报”也说，“如果得出结论说这次会谈将大大加强英国—（西）德团结，那就错了。”
