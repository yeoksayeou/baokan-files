    Rapid Development of Steel, Timber, and Food Industries
    A Batch of Large, Medium, and Small Factories Built in Vast Agricultural and Pastoral Areas of Inner Mongolia
    (Our dispatch) Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which was almost a blank slate in terms of industrial construction in the past, is now being built into a new industrial base for the country in steel, timber, food, and other fields. The speed of industrial development in the autonomous region is like a galloping horse, advancing a thousand miles a day.
    Before liberation, Inner Mongolia only had small, poorly equipped power plants and grain processing factories. At that time, although the grasslands produced a lot of hides every year, there was not a single leather factory. Large amounts of wool and milk were wasted due to the lack of processing factories. The vast rural areas lacked iron farm tools, and production was very backward. Now, the region has a number of large and medium-sized enterprises in steel, logging, machinery manufacturing, electricity, coal mining, and wool spinning, leather, meat processing, dairy products, sugar production, petrochemical industry, and other fields. In 1958, the total industrial output value of the region accounted for 40.96% of the total value of industrial and agricultural (pastoral) output.
    On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the No. 1 blast furnace of Baotou Steel, which attracted national attention, produced its first heat of iron. A magnificent scene of flowing iron and red light, day and night, appeared under the Wula Mountains. In addition to the Baotou Iron and Steel Industrial Base, the autonomous region has also newly built six medium and small steel plants in Hohhot, Jining, Chifeng, Ulanhot, and other places that had never produced pig iron before.
    The newly built agricultural and pastoral machinery factories are scattered all over the region. Sowing machines, harvesters, hay balers, locomobiles, milk separators, etc., produced within the region can be seen everywhere in the autonomous region. Last year, machinery and farm tool factories in various places produced and repaired more than 100,000 pieces of various agricultural and pastoral production tools for rural and pastoral areas, and produced a large number of ball bearings, which strongly supported the motorization movement in rural and pastoral areas.
    In the vast rural and pastoral areas, hundreds of newly built factories form a new livestock product processing industrial system. The large and small dairy factories newly built in the grassland areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas process a large amount of milk into milk powder, butter, lactose, casein, and other industrial raw materials to meet the needs of national construction and people's lives. Women and children and adults in many provinces and cities across the country have eaten dairy products from Inner Mongolia. From 1953 to 1958, farmers and herdsmen in the region received income equivalent to the value of about 100,000 cattle from the sale of milk.
    Before liberation, Inner Mongolia only had a small wool weaving factory established in 1933. From 1949 to 1959, a large number of new wool textile mills of various sizes were built throughout the region. The jacquard carpets, plush, navy cloth, worsted, and blended yarns produced in the autonomous region are sold throughout the country and are deeply loved by the masses.
    A number of large-scale leather, fur, and meat combined processing plants have been newly built in the Hulunbuir, Xilin Gol grasslands, and Ulanqab League. Modern meat combined processing plants have been newly built in Jining and Hailar. These factories supply a large number of products to various parts of the country every year. The leather boots and various horse gear and leather goods they produce are not only widely supplied to people of all ethnic groups in the region but also sold to the Soviet Union and Mongolia.
    Western Inner Mongolia is an ideal sugar beet producing area in our country. The emerging sugar industry has emerged here and developed rapidly. Since the first mechanized sugar factory was put into production in Baotou in the autumn of 1955, small sugar factories have been established one after another.
    The famous Greater Khingan Mountains forest area is being built into an important timber production base for the motherland.
    In addition, Inner Mongolia has also built a number of mining enterprises to exploit the rich mineral resources of iron ore, manganese ore, mica, asbestos, natural alkali, sulfur, and petroleum. While building high-temperature and high-pressure thermal power plants and power grids for new industrial areas, many people's communes have also set up small power stations to use electricity for irrigating farmland and pastures, milking cows, and processing agricultural and pastoral products.
    This year, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, the industrial construction of Inner Mongolia has once again shown a prosperous scene of continued leaps forward. In addition to the two large machinery factories, the Tuguiwula mica mine, the Baotou Cement Plant, and the Baotou Steel's No. 3 and No. 4 large coke ovens, 20-ton open-hearth furnaces, and 10-ton electric furnaces, which were built by the state in the autonomous region, have all been put into production one after another. The key projects invested in and constructed locally have also greatly increased. After these newly built factories and mines are put into production, they will promote the faster development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry throughout the region.

    钢铁木材食品工业迅速发展
    内蒙古广大农牧区建起一批大中小型工厂
    本报讯　在工业建设上过去几乎是空白点的内蒙古自治区，现在正在建设成为国家在钢铁、木材、食品等方面的一个新兴的工业基地，自治区工业发展的速度，有如骏马奔腾，一日千里。
    解放以前，内蒙古只有设备简陋的小发电厂和粮米加工厂。那时，草原上虽然每年出产不少皮张，却没有一座皮革工厂。大量的羊毛、牛奶，也因为没有工厂加工，被烂掉。广大农村缺乏铁制农具，生产非常落后。现在，全区已拥有钢铁、森林采伐、机械制造、电力、煤矿和毛纺、皮革、肉类加工、乳品、制糖、石油化学工业等方面的一批大、中型企业。1958年全区工业总产值已占工农（牧）业总产值的40.96％。
    建国十周年前夕，全国瞩目的包钢一号高炉，流出了第一炉铁水。乌拉山下出现了日日夜夜铁水奔流、红光四射的瑰丽景象。除包头钢铁工业基地外，自治区还在从来没有生产过生铁的呼和浩特、集宁、赤峰、乌兰浩特等地，新建了六个中、小型钢铁厂。
    新建的农牧业机械厂，星罗棋布，撒遍全区，自治区各地到处可以看到区内生产的播种机、收割机、打搂草机、锅驼机、牛奶分离器……。去年，各地机械、农具厂为农村牧区生产和修配各种农牧业生产工具十万多件，并生产了大量滚珠轴承，有力地支援了农村、牧区的车子化运动。
    在辽阔的农村和牧区，成百上千座新建工厂组成了新兴的畜产品加工工业体系。草原地带和半农半牧区新建的大、小乳品工厂，把大量牛奶加工成乳粉、奶油和乳糖、酪胶等工业原料，以满足国家建设和人民生活的需要。全国有许多省市的妇孺和成人，都吃到内蒙古的乳制品。1953年到1958年，全区农牧民从出售牛奶中得到了价值约等于十万头牛的收入。
    解放前，内蒙古只有一座1933年建立的小型毛织厂。从1949到1959年，全区各地就大量建起了新的大小毛纺织厂。自治区生产的提花毯、长毛绒、海军呢、精纺和混纺绒线，行销各地，深受群众欢迎。
    在呼伦贝尔、锡林郭勒草原和乌兰察布盟等地，新建多座规模较大的皮革、皮毛和肉类联合加工厂，集宁和海拉尔新建的现代化肉类联合加工厂，这些工厂每年都以大量产品供应国内各地。而它们所生产的皮靴和各种马具、皮件，除广泛地供应区内各族人民以外，还销往苏联和蒙古等国。
    内蒙古西部是我国理想的甜菜丰产区。新兴的制糖工业在这里异军突起，飞跃发展。从1955年秋天，第一座机械化制糖厂在包头投入生产以来，小型糖厂又接连建立了起来。
    全国出名的大兴安岭林区，正在被建设成为祖国一个重要的木材生产基地。
    此外，内蒙古还兴建了一批矿藏开采企业，开采铁矿、锰矿、云母、石绵、天然碱、硫磺、石油等丰富的矿藏资源。在建设高温高压热电站和新工业区电力网的同时，许多人民公社也纷纷举办小型发电站，开始使用电力灌溉农田、牧场，挤牛奶和加工农牧产品。
    今年，内蒙古的工业建设，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，又出现了继续跃进的繁荣景象。除了国家在自治区建设的两座大型机械厂、土贵乌拉云母矿、包头水泥厂和包钢三号、四号大型焦炉、二十吨平炉、十吨电炉，都已先后投入生产外，地方投资建设的重点项目也大大增加。这些新建的厂矿投入生产后，将促进全区工业和农牧业的更快发展。
