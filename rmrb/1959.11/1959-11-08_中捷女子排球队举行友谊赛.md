Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The calm and steady Czechoslovakian National Women's Volleyball Team won its first friendly match in China on the evening of the 5th at the Beijing Gymnasium competition hall. After losing the first two sets to the Chinese National Women's Volleyball Team by a score of zero to two, they fought tenaciously and won three consecutive sets, finally reversing the defeat with a score of three to two.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long and others attended and watched the game. After the game, they met with the athletes from both sides and took a group photo together.

On the evening of the 7th, when the Czechoslovakian National Women's Volleyball Team held its second friendly match in China at the Beijing Gymnasium competition hall, they defeated the Beijing Women's Volleyball Team with a score of three to two.

The friendly match was fiercely contested, and it took two hours to determine the winner. The Beijing team today used Wang Zishu, Li Jieying, Ma Renhua, Liu Chongyang and others in rotation as the main attackers, and Liu Xuan, Lin Hongzhu, Yin Yulian, Jin Dongxi and others in rotation as the setters. They played relatively steadily in the first four sets, with fewer serving and spiking errors, and even played a few beautiful "quick set" balls. They won the first set with a score of fifteen to twelve. However, in the second and third sets, the visiting team's blocking was very tight, and the home team's spikes were blocked back by the opponent many times. In addition, they did not pay attention to the visiting team's athlete Urmolova (number five)'s varied dinks, and lost successively with scores of fourteen to sixteen and ten to fifteen. In the fourth set, the Beijing team won with a score of fifteen to eleven, tying the score at two all. In the crucial fifth set, the home team lost again with a score of ten to fifteen.

    中捷女子排球队举行友谊赛
    据新华社讯　沉着、稳健的捷克斯洛伐克国家女子排球队，5日晚在北京体育馆比赛馆赢得了访华第一场友谊比赛的胜利。她们在以零比二先输给中国国家女子排球队两局的不利情况下，顽强奋战，连赢三局，最后以三比二反败为胜。
    周恩来总理、贺龙副总理等出席观看了球赛。在球赛结束后接见了双方的运动员，并一起合影。
    在7日晚，捷克斯洛伐克国家女子排球队在北京体育馆比赛馆举行访华第二场友谊比赛时，以三比二战胜了北京女子排球队。
    友谊比赛争夺激烈，打了两个小时才分胜负。北京队今天由王子淑、李杰英、马纫华、刘冲阳等人轮流作主要的攻击手，刘暄、林宏珠、尹玉莲、金东熙等人轮流为托球手，头四局打得比较稳，发球、扣球失误都比较少，而且还打出了几次漂亮的“快板”球，第一局以十五比十二先胜。但第二、三局客队拦网很严，主队多次扣球都被对方封回，加上没有注意客队运动健将乌尔莫洛娃（五号）多变化的吊球，先后以十四比十六和十比十五失败。第四局北京队以十五比十一获胜，扳成二平。关键性的第五局主队又以十比十五失败。
