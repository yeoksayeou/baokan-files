    The Great Sino-Soviet Unity is Indestructible
    Praises the Soviet people for continuously making significant contributions to the noble cause of safeguarding world peace
    Ambassador Chervonenko talks about the Soviet Union exceeding its ambitious plan to build communism
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th November: Soviet Ambassador to China, Chervonenko, held a grand reception this evening to celebrate the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. At the reception, both hosts and guests expressed warm congratulations on the further consolidation and development of the eternal and indestructible friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

    Vice Chairman Dong Biwu said in his speech at the reception: "The great unity between China and the Soviet Union, built on the foundation of Marxism-Leninism, is indestructible. The traditional friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union and the friendly unity of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union will continue to strengthen and consolidate." He pointed out: "All conspiracies by reactionary forces headed by US imperialism to undermine Sino-Soviet unity have been and will be met with ignominious failure."

    At the reception, Premier Zhou Enlai raised his glass and proposed a toast to the great and indestructible friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, to the unity of the people of the world, and to world peace.

    The reception was held at 6:00 p.m. Also attending the reception were Party and state leaders Zhu De, Lin Biao, Deng Xiaoping, Lin Boqu, Peng Zhen, Li Fuchun, He Long, Li Xiannian, Lu Dingyi, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Bo Yibo, Nie Rongzhen, Luo Ruiqing, Xi Zhongxun, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, Lin Feng, Tan Zheng, and Yang Shangkun.

    Also present at the reception were Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, Burhan, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, Fu Zuoyi, President of the Supreme People's Court, Xie Juezai, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhang Hanfu, and others.

    In his speech, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu warmly extended festive greetings to the great Soviet people. He said that today, with great excitement and joy, we join the great Soviet people in celebrating this glorious festival of the working people of the world. He extended the warmest and heartfelt congratulations on behalf of the Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China to the fraternal Soviet people and the Soviet government.

    Vice Chairman Dong Biwu praised the great international significance of the October Revolution and the great achievements made by the Soviet people over the past forty-two years. He particularly pointed out that now, the Soviet people have entered a new era of comprehensively unfolding the construction of communism, and they are striving to complete the Seven-Year Plan far ahead of schedule with enormous political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm. All of this fully and powerfully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

    Dong Biwu said: "The great Soviet people are constantly making significant contributions to the noble cause of safeguarding world peace." He praised Comrade Khrushchev's trip to the United States in September this year, and the proposal he put forward during his visit to the United States regarding comprehensive and complete disarmament. He said that the Chinese government and the Chinese people fully support this peace initiative. At present, the forces of world peace greatly outweigh the forces of imperialist war. The imperialist policy of aggression and war headed by the United States will inevitably suffer even greater defeats.

    While talking about the great victories achieved by the Chinese people in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past ten years, Dong Biwu expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Soviet government and the Soviet people for their fraternal assistance to the Chinese people. He finally proposed a toast to the ever-increasing consolidation and strengthening of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to the eternal and indestructible friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    Ambassador Chervonenko spoke first at the beginning of the reception. After expounding on the great significance of the October Socialist Revolution, he said that looking back at the glorious road the Soviet people have traveled over the past forty-two years, we can proudly say that our heroic people have turned their country into a powerful socialist country and achieved tremendous achievements praised by all progressive mankind. He said that now the Soviet Union has entered a new historical stage, which is the period of comprehensively unfolding the construction of communism. The surging labor and political enthusiasm of all Soviet working people, and the unity of the Soviet people around the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government, convincingly prove that the ambitious plan to build communism can not only be completed, but also be overfulfilled.

    Chervonenko said that all socialist countries are smoothly building a new life. The unity of socialist countries is more solid than ever, and no one can undermine this unity.

    Chervonenko said that we are welcoming the 42nd anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution at a time when the international situation is more favorable. Of course, the struggle for lasting peace is still not easy. The people of all countries must not be deceived by the bankrupt advocates of the "Cold War". Achieving comprehensive and complete disarmament is currently the most important issue for all mankind.

    When Chervonenko spoke about the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China, he said that an indestructible and eternal friendship links the Soviet people and the Chinese people together. Our friendship has been forged in the struggle to achieve the great common goal of communism and socialism. The ambassador said, please allow me to assure you that the Soviet people will, in the future, do everything possible to develop and consolidate the fraternal friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China, and to further develop and consolidate the friendship between the people of all countries in the world socialist system.

    When Ambassador Chervonenko spoke about the achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction, he said that the Soviet people, together with their Chinese friends, are proud of the outstanding achievements of the People's Republic of China. He wished the great Chinese people greater achievements in socialist construction and in the struggle for world peace.

    After Ambassador Chervonenko and Vice Chairman Dong Biwu spoke, the band played the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union in succession. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by the Chinese and foreign guests attending the reception.

    Also invited to attend tonight's reception were the heads of government departments, people's organizations, democratic parties, senior generals of the People's Liberation Army, well-known figures from all walks of life in the capital, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China.

    契尔沃年科大使谈苏联将超额完成建设共产主义的宏伟计划
    新华社7日讯　苏联驻华大使契尔沃年科今晚举行盛大招待会，庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年。在招待会上，宾主双方为中苏两国永恒的、牢不可破的友谊进一步巩固和发展，表示热烈的祝贺。
    董必武副主席在招待会上讲话，他指出：“中苏两国建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的伟大团结，是牢不可破的。中苏两国人民之间的传统友谊和以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的友好团结将不断增强和巩固。”他指出：“以美帝国主义为首的反动势力妄图破坏中苏团结的一切阴谋，已经而且还将遭到可耻的失败”。
    在招待会上，周恩来总理举杯提议，为中苏两国人民伟大的牢不可破的友谊、为全世界人民的团结、为世界和平而干杯。
    招待会在今晚六时举行。出席招待会的党和国家领导人还有，朱德、林彪、邓小平、林伯渠、彭真、李富春、贺龙、李先念、陆定一、陈伯达、康生、薄一波、聂荣臻、罗瑞卿、习仲勋、沈钧儒、郭沫若、陈叔通、林枫、谭政、杨尚昆。
    政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，国防委员会副主席傅作义，最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，外交部副部长章汉夫等也出席了招待会。
    董必武副主席在讲话中，热烈地向伟大的苏联人民表示节日的祝贺。他说，我们今天怀着十分兴奋和愉快的心情，同伟大的苏联人民一起来欢庆这个全世界劳动人民的光辉节日。他代表中国人民和中华人民共和国政府向兄弟般的苏联人民和苏联政府致以最热烈的衷心的祝贺。
    董必武副主席赞扬了十月革命的伟大国际意义以及四十二年来苏联人民所取得的伟大成就，他特别指出，现在，苏联人民进入了一个全面展开共产主义建设的新时期，他们正以巨大的政治热情和劳动热情，为大大提前完成七年计划而奋斗。所有这一切，都充分有力地显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    董必武说：“伟大的苏联人民在维护世界和平的崇高事业中不断地作出重大的贡献”。他赞扬了赫鲁晓夫同志今年9月的美国之行，以及他在访问美国期间所提出的关于全面彻底裁军的建议。他说，对于这一和平创议，中国政府和中国人民完全支持。目前世界和平力量大大地超过了帝国主义的战争势力。以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，必将遭到更大的失败。
    董必武在谈到中国人民十年来在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中所取得的伟大胜利时，向给予中国人民兄弟般援助的苏联政府和苏联人民，表示衷心的感谢。他最后提议为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营日益巩固和壮大，为中苏两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊干杯。

    契尔沃年科说，所有社会主义国家都在顺利建设着新生活。社会主义各国的团结比任何时候都更加牢固了，任何人也破坏不了这种团结一致。
    契尔沃年科说，我们迎接十月社会主义革命四十二周年正是国际形势更加有利的时候，当然，争取持久和平的斗争也还不是轻而易举的，各国人民绝不能被破产了的“冷战”拥护者所欺骗。实现全面彻底的裁军，这是全人类目前最主要的问题。
    契尔沃年科讲到苏中两国人民的友谊时说，牢不可破的永恒的友谊把苏联人民和中国人民联系在一起，我们之间的友谊是在为争取实现伟大的共同目标——共产主义和社会主义的斗争中凝结起来的。大使说，请允许我向你们保证，苏联人民今后将尽一切力量来发展和巩固苏中两国人民之间兄弟般的友谊，进一步发展和巩固世界社会主义体系各国人民之间的友谊。
    契尔沃年科大使在讲到中国人民社会主义建设的成就时说，苏联人民同自己的中国朋友们在一起，为中华人民共和国的卓越成就感到骄傲。祝伟大的中国人民在社会主义建设中、在争取全世界的和平中取得更大的成就。
