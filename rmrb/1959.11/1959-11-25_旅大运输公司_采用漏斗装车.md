    Lüda Transportation Company
    Adopts Funnel Loading
    (Our dispatch) Workers at the Lüda Transportation Company recently constructed an elevated funnel at the Nanguanling Limestone Quarry, increasing loading efficiency by more than sixteen times.
    Their method involved constructing a rectangular trough suspended next to the limestone pile. Below the trough, six funnels are arranged. Workers push wheelbarrows to unload the limestone into the trough, and trucks stop under the funnels. By opening the funnel gates, the trucks are quickly loaded. This elevated funnel can accommodate one truck and two trailers underneath it. It takes only one minute and thirty seconds to fill them simultaneously. Calculating with a load of ten tons of limestone, it takes only nine seconds to load one ton on average.

    旅大运输公司
    采用漏斗装车
    本报讯　旅大市运输公司职工最近在南关岭石灰石采石场修建了一个高空漏斗，使装车效率提高十六倍多。
    他们的做法是，傍石灰石堆悬空修成一个长方形的槽子，槽下排有六个漏斗，由工人推着轱辘马把石灰石倾卸到槽子内，汽车即停在漏斗下面，把漏斗的闸门一开，一下子就把车装好了。这个高空漏斗下面能停一辆汽车和两个挂车，只需一分三十秒钟就能同时装满，以一次装十吨石灰石计算，平均装一吨只用九秒钟。
