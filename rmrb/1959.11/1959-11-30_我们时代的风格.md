Our Times' Style
By our reporter Liu Yaoli

On April 30, 1956, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, delivered a congratulatory speech at the National Conference of Advanced Producers, saying: "Advanced producers should not only maintain their own advancement, but also strive to promote others from backwardness to advancement. Therefore, advanced producers must use all methods to help and teach others, and constantly strive to become even more advanced."

Liu Zhengliang, an advanced producer, Communist Party member, and bricklayer from the Sixth Construction Engineering Company of Hunan Province, who attended the meeting that year, responded to the Party's call with practical actions and made many vivid contributions to helping the backward. Over the past three years, sixteen workers have caught up with the advanced under his help and become advanced producers in the province, city, and their own unit. Many individuals and collectives have also significantly improved their production under his help and influence. He also led a team to promote advanced experiences to many construction sites in Hunan Province to spread advanced technology.

For six years, Liu Zhengliang has overfulfilled the state plan every month, never had a safety accident, and created many advanced experiences and tools. He has been rated as an advanced producer in Changsha City, Hunan Province, and the whole country for twenty consecutive times, and was elected as a representative to the National People's Congress. In early October of this year, the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Changsha Municipal People's Government formally announced Liu Zhengliang as Changsha City's "Advanced Model of Communist Ideological Style" and called on all workers in the city to learn from Liu Zhengliang.

From the following few ordinary events, we can see how Liu Zhengliang's thoughts and actions shine with the light of communist ideology.

	Visiting to "Deliver the Scriptures"

"Dear Comrade Liu Zhengliang: Thanks to your selfless and enthusiastic help, our chimney project was completed seventeen days ahead of schedule, achieving more, faster, better, and more economical and safe results, and at the same time enabled us to learn a set of advanced chimney construction technology. We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to you." This letter was written by the members of the Jiang Nan Gui Youth Shock Brigade of Xiangtan City Engineering Company.

Two years ago, the Jiang Nan Gui Youth Shock Brigade undertook the chimney construction project of Hunan Refractory Materials Factory. They had never built such a tall chimney before, but the task assigned by the state had to be completed on schedule. This worried the young people of the Jiang Nan Gui Brigade very much. Later, they remembered Liu Zhengliang, a colleague in Changsha, who was not only experienced but also willing to help others. So, Jiang Nan Gui himself rushed to Changsha to find Liu Zhengliang.

After listening to Jiang Nan Gui's request, Liu Zhengliang knew that this was a relatively difficult subject. It would not be easy to explain clearly in Changsha, so he decided to go to the Xiangtan construction site with Jiang Nan Gui.

At that time, some people said to him: "Don't go! We are on piece-rate wages. Taking leave to go will reduce income and cost travel expenses." Liu Zhengliang said sternly: "What wages, what travel expenses? Only by completing the chimney project ahead of schedule and passing on advanced technology to others is that the most important thing! Today's country is our own country of the working class. How can I not go when I see the state's property in danger of being damaged and my class brothers in trouble?"

Liu Zhengliang asked for leave from his unit and went to the Xiangtan construction site, immediately joining the entire team of Jiang Nan Gui to start the intense battle. He first gave everyone a technical lesson, patiently telling everyone bit by bit the key technologies and secrets of building chimneys that he had gradually accumulated through countless difficulties. However, when the workers arrived at the site to operate, they still did not know how to start. Liu Zhengliang carefully taught everyone how to do it, and like a teacher teaching elementary school students, he very patiently pointed out some small but very important techniques such as not putting lime in the expansion joints of the chimney. In this way, after two days and two nights of hard teaching and hard learning, Liu Zhengliang left the construction site only after everyone had learned it.

The towering chimney was quickly built. Those who know the inside story praise Liu Zhengliang's communist style as being even higher than the chimney.

"Brother Hang-Around" Became an Advanced Producer

This summer, when Liu Zhengliang's team was transferred to the Fourth Work Zone, they launched a competition against the Third Team. The next day, a thin young worker, holding a challenge letter in both hands, led the worker representatives of the Third Team to Liu Zhengliang's team with gongs and drums. Liu Zhengliang looked up and saw that it was Cao Jusheng, a good friend from three years ago. Neither of them expected to meet on such an occasion, and they shook hands tightly with excitement.

In 1956, Cao Jusheng was a deputy worker in the work section led by Liu Zhengliang, and he was lazy. Sometimes he did not wear work clothes, but went to work in a white silk shirt and new leather shoes, always failing to meet the quota, so he got the nickname of "Young Master" and "Brother Hang-Around".

At that time, Liu Zhengliang thought: How can production be improved with such a comrade in the work section? As soon as he finished work, he took the initiative to find Cao Jusheng to take a walk together and talk to him about various things. Gradually they became friends, and Cao Jusheng could accept what Liu Zhengliang said.

One day, Liu Zhengliang talked about his own suffering past. Before liberation, he had no job and was tricked into repairing roads, begging all the way home. This inspired Cao Jusheng to talk about his own background: "I herded cattle for the landlord at the age of eight, worked as a farmhand at the age of twelve, and worked as a deputy worker in Changsha at the age of fifteen. I only had two sets of short clothes and slept on two planks in the ash shed, working from dawn till dusk, and only earned more than nine yuan in two months, reluctant to spend a penny, and gave it all to my family to buy rice.... But now it's different. My family has been allocated land, and my life doesn't need my burden; my monthly salary is tens of yuan, and my life has been greatly improved."

"Why was it so hard in the past, and now it's so good?" "You also worked in the past, why was it hard? Now you also work, why is life so good?" Liu Zhengliang gradually enlightened Cao Jusheng's class consciousness and said: "Today's happiness is the result of the Party leading our working class to struggle and labor. How can we live up to the Party if we don't do a good job in production!" At this point, Cao Jusheng suddenly realized and couldn't help shedding tears of shame when he thought about his own performance.

Cao Jusheng's mind was clear, and his enthusiasm was sufficient. Liu Zhengliang was very happy to see this, and he took two measures to continue helping him. On the one hand, he helped him arrange his life and set up a savings plan; on the other hand, he spared no effort to help him technically, teaching him a complete set of advanced experiences in bricklaying and plastering. After Cao Jusheng mastered the advanced operation method of "squeezing pulp with both hands", his work efficiency increased rapidly, and the number of bricks laid every day increased from more than 2,000 to more than 3,000, 4,000, and 5,000. Within half a year, he rose from a level 2 deputy worker to a level 3 bricklayer and was rated as an advanced producer in Changsha City. Because of his continuous progress, he has gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.

Helping a Competition Opponent Get the Red Flag

In July of this year, Liu Zhengliang's work team was transferred to the Fourth Work Zone to participate in the expansion project of the Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and quickly launched a "counterpart competition" with the Fourth Team of this work zone. Liu Zhengliang's work team was responsible for building the process building, and the Fourth Team was responsible for building the chemical building. The size of these two buildings was almost exactly the same. The two teams chased after each other, and for half a month they were evenly matched.

Later, Liu Zhengliang's team promoted three advanced experiences, such as ash troughs and two-purpose ash buckets, and used eight advanced tools, and the work efficiency suddenly increased by more than double. The original stalemate quickly changed.

The Fourth Team is an advanced team with great enthusiasm. However, it has a weakness: it works hard, but not cleverly enough. Advanced experiences have not been well promoted, so it has gradually fallen behind. When Liu Zhengliang's team built to the third floor, the Fourth Team had only built to the second floor and became a weak link in the entire work zone.

Liu Zhengliang began to feel uneasy. He thought: "We have completed the plan and won the red flag. If the Fourth Team cannot complete the plan, the state plan still cannot be completed." He took the initiative to propose transferring ten people from his team to support the Fourth Team.

"Your team only has seventy-two people. Can you spare ten people?" the site director asked him.

"Supporting the Fourth Team is primarily our team's responsibility. We are confident that we can not only spare people to support the Fourth Team, but also overfulfill the task," Liu Zhengliang replied firmly.

Deputy team leader Wang Donghai couldn't hold back his breath: "We don't have enough people to begin with. If we transfer people out, what if we can't get the red flag?"

Liu Zhengliang thought for a moment and said loudly: "Is the competition just for winning the red flag? No! We must comprehensively complete the state plan, help and support each other, and improve together. Therefore, people must be transferred, and we must choose the strongest comrades to support the Fourth Team!"

After Liu Zhengliang said this, the workers all agreed.

The Fourth Team increased its new strength, and advanced experiences and advanced tools were also quickly promoted throughout the team. Liu Zhengliang often went to the Fourth Team to help solve the problems encountered in the promotion of advanced experiences. In this way, the bricklaying efficiency of the Fourth Team increased by more than two times.

After transferring ten backbones, Liu Zhengliang's team immediately organized the sixteen apprentices and put them into the competition, and further generally implemented clever work, and the work efficiency increased by more than double again.

At the end of August, both teams overfulfilled the task. At the joyful award ceremony, the work zone leaders awarded two red flags, one to Liu Zhengliang's team and one to the Fourth Team.

Liu Zhengliang's team's noble behavior of selfless help to others further promoted the in-depth development of the socialist labor competition in the entire work zone. (Attached picture)

    我们时代的风格
    本报记者　刘耀黎
    1956年4月30日，刘少奇同志代表党中央在全国先进生产者代表会议上致祝词时说：“先进生产者不只是要保持自己的先进，而且要努力促进别人由落后达到先进。因此，先进生产者必须用一切方法帮助和教会别人，并且不断地争取更加先进。”
    当年曾参加这次会议的先进生产者、共产党员、湖南省第六建筑工程公司泥工刘正良，用实际行动响应党的号召，做出了很多先进帮助落后的生动事迹。三年多来，有十六名工人在他的帮助下赶上了先进，成为省、市和本单位的先进生产者，还有不少的个人和集体在他的帮助和影响下，生产有了显著的提高。他还曾率领着一个推广先进经验的工作队，到湖南省许多建筑工地传播了先进技术。
    刘正良六年来，月月超额完成国家计划，从未出过安全事故，而且创造了不少先进经验和先进工具。他连续二十次被评为长沙市、湖南省和全国的先进生产者，并且当选为全国人民代表大会代表。今年10月上旬，中共长沙市委、长沙市人民委员会还正式宣布刘正良是长沙市的“共产主义思想风格先进标兵”，号召全市工人向刘正良学习。
    从下面几件普通的事情，可以看出刘正良的思想行动怎样闪耀着共产主义思想的光辉。
          登门“送经”
    “亲爱的刘正良同志：承你无私地热情地帮助，我们的烟囱工程提前十七天完成了计划，作到了多、快、好、省和安全，同时使我们学会了一套砌烟囱的先进技术。我们谨向你致以衷心的谢意。”写这封信的，是湘潭市工程公司姜南桂青年突击队的队员们。
    两年前，姜南桂青年突击队承担了湖南耐火材料厂的烟囱建设工程。这么高大的烟囱，他们没有修建过，但是国家交给的任务必须如期完成。这可把姜南桂队的青年们急坏了。后来他们想起长沙有个同行刘正良，不但经验丰富，而且肯帮助别人。于是，姜南桂自己赶到长沙去找刘正良。
    刘正良听完姜南桂的要求，知道这是一个比较困难的课题，在长沙说也说不清楚，就决定同姜南桂一道到湘潭工地去。
    当时有人对他说：“不要去吧！我们是计件工资，请假跑去，会减少收入，还要花路费。”刘正良却严肃地说：“什么工资，什么路费，只有把烟囱工程提前完成，把先进技术传授给别人，那才是最重要的！今天的国家是我们工人阶级自己的国家，看到国家的财产有受损失的危险，看到自己的阶级兄弟有困难，我怎能不去呢？”
    刘正良在本单位请了假，到湘潭工地，立即同姜南桂队的全队同志一起投入了紧张的战斗。他首先给大家上了技术课，把他经过无数困难逐步积累起来的一套砌烟囱的关键技术和诀窍，一点一滴都耐心地告诉了大家。可是工人刚到现场操作时，还是不知道如何下手。刘正良就仔细教大家怎么干，并且像老师教小学生似的，非常耐心地把砌烟囱伸缩缝不能放石灰等一些小窍门，但又是很重要的技术，都指点给大家。这样，经过两天两夜的苦教苦学，一直到大家都学会了以后，刘正良才离开这个工地。
    这座高耸入云的烟囱很快就建成了。知道底细的人，都称赞刘正良的共产主义风格比这座烟囱还要高。
    “吊哥”成了先进生产者
    今年夏天，刘正良队调到四工区时，向第三队发起了竞赛。第二天，一个瘦瘦的青年工人，双手拿着应战书，带领着三队的工人代表，敲锣打鼓来到了刘正良队。刘正良抬头一看，原来这是三年前的好朋友曹菊生。两人都没有想到在这么一个场合下相遇，激动得紧紧地握起手来。
    1956年，曹菊生在刘正良领导的工段做副工，好吃懒做。有时他不穿工作服，而穿着白绸衬衣和新皮鞋上工，老是达不到定额，因此落得了“大少爷”、“吊哥”的称号。
    当时，刘正良想：工段里有这样的同志，怎么能搞好生产呢？他一下工便主动地去找曹菊生一起散步，和他谈论各种各样的事情。渐渐地他们成了朋友，刘正良讲的话，曹菊生都能接受。
    一天，刘正良谈到了自己苦难的过去。解放前，他没有工作，被别人骗去修马路，一路讨饭回家的情形，启发曹菊生也谈出了自己的身世：“我八岁替地主看牛，十二岁当长工，十五岁在长沙做副工。身边只有两身短衣服，铺两块木板子睡在灰棚里，起早摸黑，搞了两个月才赚了九块多钱，一个也舍不得用，全部给家里买米……。可是现在不同了，家里分了田，生活不要我负担；我每月的工资是几十元，生活大大改善了。”
    “为什么过去那样苦，现在又这样好？”“过去你也劳动，为什么苦？现在你也劳动，生活为什么这样好？”刘正良一步步地启发曹菊生的阶级觉悟，并且说：“今天的幸福，是党领导我们工人阶级斗争和劳动得来的，不好好搞生产，怎么对得住党！”讲到这里，曹菊生恍然大悟，想想自己的表现，不禁羞愧得流下泪来。
    曹菊生的思想开朗了，干劲也就足了。刘正良看着满心高兴，便采取两个办法继续帮助他。一方面帮助他安排好生活，订出储蓄计划；一方面不遗余力地从技术上帮助他，教他学会了砌墙和抹灰的全套先进经验。曹菊生掌握了“双手挤浆”的先进操作方法以后，工效突飞猛进，每天砌砖数量由两千多块增加到三千多、四千多、五千多块，半年内就由二级副工提高到三级泥工，并且被评为长沙市的先进生产者。由于他不断进步，已经光荣地参加了中国共产党。
      帮助竞赛对手得红旗
    今年7月，刘正良工作队调到四工区参加中南矿冶学院的扩建工程，很快就同这个工区的第四队展开了“对口赛”。刘正良工作队负责修建工艺楼，第四队修化学楼。这两座楼房的大小几乎完全相同。两个队你追我赶，有半个月都是相持不下，分不出高低。
    后来，刘正良队推广了盛灰槽、两用灰桶等三项先进经验，使用了八种先进工具，工效猛然提高一倍以上。原来的相持局面很快就改变了。
    四队是个先进队，干劲很足。可是有个弱点，苦干得多，巧干不够，先进经验没有很好推广，因此慢慢地就落在后面了。当刘正良队砌到三层楼时，四队还只砌到两层，并且成了全工区的薄弱环节。
    刘正良开始不安起来。他想：“我们完成了计划，夺得了红旗，四队不能完成计划，国家计划还是不能完成。”他主动提出从自己队里调十个人去支援四队。
    “你们队只有七十二个人，一下能抽出十个人吗？”工地主任问他。
    “支援四队，首先是我们队的责任。我们有把握做到既抽人支援四队，又超额完成任务。”刘正良坚定地回答。
    副工队长王东海却沉不住气了：“我们本来人手就不够，还要调人出去，拿不到红旗怎么办？”
    刘正良想了想高声地说：“竞赛难道就是为了夺红旗吗？不！我们要全面完成国家计划，要互相帮助，互相支援，共同提高。因此，人一定要调，而且要挑最强的同志去支援四队！”
    经刘正良这么一说，工人们都同意了。
    四队增加了新的力量，先进经验和先进工具也在全队迅速推广开来。刘正良还经常到四队帮助解决推广先进经验中遇到的问题。就这样，四队的砌墙工效提高了两倍多。
    刘正良队在调出十个骨干以后，马上把十六个徒工也组织起来，投入了竞赛，并且进一步普遍实行巧干，工效又提高了一倍以上。
    8月底，这两个队都超额完成了任务。在欢天喜地的授奖会上，工区领导颁发了两面红旗，一面给刘正良队，一面给第四队。
    刘正良队这种大公无私帮助别人的崇高行为，进一步推动了全工区社会主义劳动竞赛的深入开展。（附图片）
