    Do a Good Job in Winter Resin Tapping
    People's Daily Commentator
    The mass movement for winter resin tapping is vigorously developing in various producing areas. This is of great significance for greatly increasing the production of rosin and turpentine, supporting light and heavy industries, especially the production of paper, soap, paint, rubber, and metallurgy.
    Large-scale winter resin tapping breaks the old habit of only tapping resin from "Qingming" to "Frost's Descent" in history, and is a revolution in resin tapping technology. For a long time, there has been an old idea in resin tapping work that resin cannot be tapped in winter. In recent years, especially in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, the fact that some areas carried out winter resin tapping has proved that as long as the characteristics of winter resin tapping are mastered and necessary technical measures are taken, many areas can tap resin in winter, and the output is not much less than in other seasons. Especially in the southern and southwestern regions of China, where the climate is warm, it is generally suitable for winter resin tapping.
    This year's resin production, thanks to the attention of party and government leaders at all levels and the vigorous mass movement, has achieved great results, alleviating the once tight supply of rosin. However, with the continued leap forward in various production and construction projects this year and the effort to achieve a good start for industrial production next year, it is necessary to produce more and better rosin to meet the needs of all parties. Therefore, it is an important task for all producing areas to carry out the winter resin tapping movement more extensively and deeply, to fight hard for the last month, and to tap a large amount of resin.
    There are many favorable conditions for deepening winter resin tapping this year. Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over resin tapping work; the unified arrangement of people's communes has solved the labor problem of resin tapping. In terms of organizational leadership, income distribution, and resin tapping technology, a lot of experience has been accumulated. Many areas have made relatively sufficient preparations for resin tapping tools, agents, and winter supplies. All localities should make full use of these favorable conditions to do a good job in winter resin tapping.
    In order to carry out the winter resin tapping movement better, all localities should, in accordance with the spirit of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, thoroughly oppose right-leaning tendencies and go all out, which is the fundamental guarantee for completing the winter resin tapping task. In Fujian Province, due to the good ideological work and sufficient enthusiasm in rosin production, the output of rosin has continued to increase, increasing by 40% in August compared with July, and by another 30% in September compared with August. The output in the third quarter was four times the total output in the first half of the year. The party committees of relevant regions should strengthen their leadership over this work. Regions that have completed their plans ahead of schedule must not relax and dismount; they must maintain their enthusiasm and strive to overfulfill their plans again and again. Regions that have not yet completed their plans must speed up and strive to catch up. According to the current level of rosin production, persisting in production for one more day can supply the need for manufacturing more than 60,000 tons of paper or more than 6,000 tons of soap.
    All localities should pay attention to strengthening the leadership of existing resin tapping personnel, doing a good job in ideological work, and grasping life while grasping production. It is necessary to vigorously carry out the competition movement of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward, giving full play to everyone's enthusiasm and creativity, and greatly improving labor productivity. Organizing on-site visits, technical performances, strengthening technical guidance, and improving winter resin tapping technology are also important aspects of improving work efficiency. In the resin tapping movement, local inventions and creations should be tested and promoted in light of local conditions. While carrying out winter resin tapping, we must also actively promote the experience of increasing rosin production by boiling rosin core with water.
    Resin tapping is a long-term production. In the winter resin tapping movement, all localities must pay attention to protecting resin resources and combining utilization with protection.
    Winter resin tapping work is very important. It is hoped that all localities will adhere to putting politics in command, seize the last thirty-odd days of this year, work hard and strive for a complete victory in rosin production.

    做好冬季采脂工作
    本报评论员
    冬季采割松脂的群众运动正在各产区蓬勃开展。这对于大量增产松香、松节油，支援轻重工业特别是支援造纸、肥皂、油漆、橡胶和冶金等工业生产具有重大意义。
    大规模的冬季采脂，打破了历史上只在“清明”到“霜降”采脂的旧习惯，是采脂技术上的革命。在采脂工作上，长期以来存在着冬季不能采脂的一种旧观念。最近几年，特别是大跃进的1958年，有些地区开展冬季采脂的事实证明，只要掌握好冬季采脂的特点，采取必要的技术措施，许多地区都可以在冬季采脂，而且产量比别的季节也少不了多少。特别在我国的南方和西南地区，气候温暖，一般都适于冬季采脂。
    今年的采脂生产，由于各地党、政领导的重视和大搞群众运动，已经取得了很大成绩，缓和了松香曾经一度供应紧张的情况。但是随着今年各项生产建设的继续跃进和力争明年工业生产的开门红，必须生产更多更好的松香，满足各方面的需要。因此，更广泛、更深入地开展冬季采脂运动，大战最后一个月，大量采割松脂，是当前各产区的重要任务。
    今年深入开展冬季采脂，是有许多有利条件的。各级党委加强了对采脂工作的领导；人民公社的统一安排，解决了采脂的劳力问题，在组织领导、收入分配和采脂技术方面，也已积累不少经验，许多地区对采脂工具、药剂和过冬物资都做了比较充分的准备。各地应该充分运用这些有利条件，作好冬季采脂工作。
    为了把冬季采脂运动开展得更好，各地应根据党的八届八中全会决议的精神，反透右倾，鼓足干劲，这是保证完成冬季采脂任务的根本保证。福建省在松脂生产中，由于思想工作作得好，干劲鼓得足，松脂产量不断增长，8月比7月增长40％，9月份又比8月增长了30％，第三季度一个季度的产量，为上半年产量总和的四倍。有关地区的党委应加强对这项工作的领导，已经提前完成计划的地区，绝不能松劲下马，干劲必须一鼓再鼓，争取超产再超产；还没有完成计划的地区，更要快马加鞭，力争迎头赶上。根据现在的松脂生产水平，多坚持一天生产，就可供应制造六万多吨纸或六千多吨肥皂的需要。
    各地应注意加强对现有采脂人员的领导，作好思想工作，在抓生产的同时也要抓生活。要大力开展学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进的竞赛运动，充分发挥每个人的积极性和创造性，大大提高劳动生产率。组织现场参观、技术表演，加强技术指导，提高冬季采脂技术，也是提高工效的一个重要方面。在采脂运动中，各地的发明创造，应当经过试验，因地制宜地推广。在进行冬季采脂的同时，还要积极推广水煮明子增产松脂的经验。
    采脂是一项长期性的生产，在冬季的采脂运动中，各地必须注意保护松脂资源，做到利用与保护相结合。
    冬季采脂工作是非常重要的，希望各地坚持政治挂帅，抓紧今年最后的三十多天，大干特干，争取松脂生产获得全胜。
