    Catching Up
    Dīng Shān
    Today, this newspaper publishes the facts about a large number of "poor production teams" in the people's communes of Shanxi, Liaoning, and Inner Mongolia catching up with the rich teams. This is a matter of great significance!
    This matter eloquently proves the enormous superiority of the people's communes in comprehensively developing the rural economy. It not only enables the teams whose production has already developed relatively quickly to continue to develop, but also enables the teams with long-term relatively backward production to rapidly develop production, enabling the commune members whose lives are relatively difficult to quickly improve their lives, creating conditions for the further consolidation and development of the people's communes.
    Before the establishment of the people's communes last year, although there had been several years of cooperative movement and the lives of the broad masses of farmers had greatly improved, there were still some advanced cooperatives in the position of "poor" cooperatives. For example, in Shanxi Province, when the communes were first established, among the more than 20,300 management areas (i.e., the former advanced cooperatives) of the more than 900 communes in the province, there were still more than 7,000 "poor management areas" with an average income of less than 35 yuan per person, accounting for more than one-third of the management areas in the province; and in the year after communization, many "poor management areas" have caught up with "rich management areas." Among them, 1,500 "poor management areas" have an average income of 75 yuan per person, which is double that of last year; more than 2,900 "poor management areas" have an average income of 50 to 70 yuan per person, which is 40% to 100% higher than last year; and the production of the remaining "poor management areas" has also greatly developed, and the average income per member has mostly exceeded 40 yuan. The situation in Shanxi is like this, and the situation in Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, and other regions is roughly the same. It can be seen how rapid and enormous changes have taken place in the economic face of our country's rural areas this year!
    Why is the scale of this transformation from poverty to wealth so large this year, and why is the speed so fast? There are two main reasons: one is the existence of the people's communes; the other is that the spirit of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results has become the practical action of the people. With this incomparably superior "large-scale and public" people's commune, and with the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, how can a huge change on an unprecedented scale not occur? Here is the situation of Caojiabao Management Area of Madaotou People's Commune in Zuoyun County, Shanxi. This management area is a well-known poor place. The reason for its poverty is not that resources are not abundant, nor that the people are not diligent, but simply because the agricultural cooperative is small in scale, with few people and weak strength, lacking funds and technology, and diverse operations cannot be carried out. With the "large-scale and public" people's commune, this situation is completely different. This year, the commune supported them with 5,500 yuan of funds and sent cadres to strengthen its leadership, so the enthusiasm of the masses rose, and more than 50 kinds of production avenues were opened up. The total income for the whole year doubled compared with last year, and the average income per person has risen from more than 30 yuan last year to more than 70 yuan, catching up with the rich management areas. This fact powerfully illustrates that under the unified leadership and vigorous support of the people's commune, and on the basis of the broad masses of people going all out and striving for the upstream, production can take off and the economic face of the countryside can be rapidly changed.
    The fact that a large number of "poor teams" in many places have caught up with the rich teams has already set an example and created experience for those "poor teams" that are chasing after the rich teams. We have reason to believe that as long as we are good at utilizing the current favorable conditions, give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, and inspire the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses, it will not take long for more "poor teams" to catch up with the rich teams, and the economic face of our country's vast rural areas will be further changed.

    迎头赶上
    丁山
    今天，本报发表的山西、辽宁和内蒙古的许多人民公社的大批“穷生产队”赶上富队的事实，是一件具有巨大意义的事情！
    这件事情雄辩地证明了人民公社在全面发展农村经济方面的巨大优越性。它不仅使生产已经发展得较快的队继续不断地发展，而且使长期生产比较落后的队迅速地发展了生产，使生活比较困难的社员迅速地改善了生活，为人民公社的进一步巩固和发展创造着条件。
    在去年人民公社成立之前，虽然经过了好几年的合作化运动，广大农民的生活有了很大的改善，但仍有一部分高级社处于“穷”社的地位。比如山西省，在刚成立公社的时候，全省九百多个公社的二万零三百多个管理区（即过去的高级社）中，每人平均收入在三十五元以下的“穷管理区”仍有七千多个，占全省管理区的三分之一以上；而在公社化以后的一年中，已经有很多的“穷管理区”赶上了“富管理区”。其中一千五百个“穷管理区”，每人平均收入达到七十五元，比去年增加一倍；二千九百多个“穷管理区”每人平均收入五十元到七十元，比去年增加40％到一倍；其余的“穷管理区”的生产也都有很大的发展，社员每人的平均收入也大都超过了四十元。山西的情形如此，辽宁、内蒙古和其他地区的情形也大致相同。可见，这一年来我国农村经济面貌已经发生了多么迅速、多么巨大的变化！
    为什么今年这种由穷变富的规模来得这样大，而速度又是这样快呢？最主要的原因有两个：一个是有了人民公社；一个是党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的精神已经变成人民群众的实际行动。有了这个具有无比优越性的“一大二公”的人民公社，又有了广大农民群众的发奋图强的冲天干劲，一个空前规模的巨大变化，怎能不发生呢？这里是山西左云县马道头人民公社曹家堡管理区的情形，这个管理区是个有名的穷地方。所以穷，并不是资源不丰富，也不是人民不勤劳，只是因为农业社规模小，人少力薄，缺少资金和技术，多种经营搞不起来。有了“一大二公”的人民公社，这情形就完全不同了，今年公社支援了它们五千五百元资金，又派去干部加强了对它的领导，于是群众的冲天干劲起来了，开辟了五十多种生产门路，全年总收入比去年增加一倍，每人平均收入已经由去年的三十多元上升到七十多元，赶上了富管理区。这个事实有力地说明：在人民公社的统一领导和大力支援下，在广大群众鼓足干劲、力争上游的基础上，就能使生产展翅高飞，迅速改变农村经济面貌。
    许多地方大批“穷队”赶上富队的事实，已经为那些正在追赶富队的“穷队”做出了榜样，创造了经验。我们有理由相信，只要善于利用当前的有利条件，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，鼓舞起广大群众的冲天干劲，用不了多长时间，一定会有更多的“穷队”赶上富队，一定会使我国广大农村的经济面貌进一步改观。
