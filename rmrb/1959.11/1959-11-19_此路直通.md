This Road Leads Directly To
Chen Zhiyan

For a time, small enterprises and indigenous methods became the target of attacks by some self-important but actually politically mediocre comrades. The reason for their attacks was nothing more than: backwardness, wastefulness, messiness. How can we carry out mass movements in running industry? This road is impassable!

Time flies, and more than a year of great practice has verified that the truth does not belong to those "brave" attackers. On the contrary, they bumped their foreheads black and blue against the truth.

Large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, foreign production methods and indigenous production methods fly wing to wing, maintaining a good situation of high-speed development of China's industry for two consecutive years, and also opening up a broad road for us to continue to maintain high speed in the future. Small enterprises and indigenous methods, as well as the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, have shown great power in 1958 and 1959. They have grown, consolidated, and improved in the mass movement, greatly promoting China's socialist construction.

When the broad masses participate in the ranks of running industry, what tremendous changes will occur? There is no need to look for materials elsewhere; just look at the report on Sichuan's large-scale manufacture of indigenous machinery published on this page today. In the past year, this province relied on the strength of the masses to use indigenous methods to manufacture 14,000 sets of simple machine tools and indigenous machine tools, and also manufactured more than 140,000 tools, equipping the agricultural implement factories and agricultural implement stations in the special districts, counties, districts, and some people's communes. In some places where machine tools had never been seen before, the sound of machines turning was heard. Although these machine tools are simple and indigenously made, this is a great transformation. Foreign things are born from indigenous things, and high things come from low things. Now that we have simple and indigenously made machine tools today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, our county, district, and people's commune agricultural implement factories will inevitably possess more refined and modern machine tools. Is there any doubt about this? In fact, we have already seen the signs of this prospect today. The aforementioned report on Sichuan Province mentioned that Lezhi County manufactured 121 indigenous machine tools at the beginning of this year. After more than half a year of continuous improvement, the number of machine tools has now increased to more than 380, and most of the wooden or iron-wood structure indigenous machine tools have been changed to all-iron, semi-indigenous and semi-foreign, or preliminary modernized machine tools. What does this show? It shows that the process of development of things is from indigenous to foreign, from low to high. We never liked backwardness. One of the purposes of our revolution is to defeat backwardness. However, we understand that our feet must be on the ground to walk. If we are divorced from reality and divorced from the masses, we will never be able to defeat backwardness. Both "large foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" are our methods of defeating backwardness at high speed. If we only have one leg, the "large foreign group," then the agricultural implement stations in many counties, districts, and people's communes in Sichuan Province would not be able to equip each station with five or three lathes in one year. Small, indigenous, and seemingly temporarily backward, but it has unlimited vitality, because it is developing. Those who point fingers and attack the "small indigenous groups" have two fatal flaws: one is that they do not believe in the tremendous creativity of the masses; the other is that they simply do not understand a common dialectical principle: newborn things, although they appear weak on the surface, have a great and invincible development prospect.

We are very proud because we have modern large enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, Changchun Automobile Factory, Luoyang Tractor Factory, Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, Jilin Chemical Factory, Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, Harbin Electric Motor Factory, Shijiazhuang Pharmaceutical Factory, etc.; we are also very proud that we have hundreds of small and medium-sized iron and steel plants, small and medium-sized machinery plants, small and medium-sized agricultural implement factories, small and medium-sized fertilizer plants, small and medium-sized pesticide plants, small and medium-sized coal mines, small and medium-sized oil plants, indigenous railways, indigenous sulfuric acid plants, and indigenous fertilizer plants. Two fronts, advancing simultaneously, this is our path to victory. This road leads directly to our great goal of building socialism.

    此路直通
    陈之衍
    小企业和土办法，有一阵，曾经成为一些自命不凡而实际上是政治庸人的同志的攻击对象。究其攻击的理由，无非是：落后、浪费、乱糟糟。办工业怎么能搞群众运动？此路不通！
    时光荏苒，一年多的伟大实践验证了：真理并不属于那些“勇敢”的攻击者。相反，他们在真理面前，额头上碰得青一块紫一块。
    大型企业和中小型企业、洋法生产和土法生产比翼齐飞，连续两年使我国的工业保持了高速度发展的大好局面，而且为我们今后继续保持高速度开辟了宽阔的道路。小企业和土办法以及土洋结合的办法在1958年和1959年都大显威风，它在群众运动中生长、巩固、提高，大大地促进了我国的社会主义建设。
    当广大群众参加到办工业的行列中来，情况会发生怎样巨大的变化呢？不必到其它地方去寻找材料，就看看今天本版发表的四川大造土机具的报道吧。这个省在过去的一年中，依靠群众力量用土办法造了一万四千台简易机床和土机床，另外还造了十四万多件工具，装备了专区、县、区和部分人民公社的农具厂和农具站。在一些从来没有见过机床的地方，响起了机器转动的声音。尽管这种机床是简易的、土造的，然而，这是一个伟大的变革。土中生洋，高从低来，既然今天有了简易的、土造的机床，明天或者后天在我们的县、区和人民公社的农具厂里，将必然拥有比较精制的现代的机床，难道还有什么疑问吗？其实，就在今天我们已经看到了这种前景的苗头。上面提到的关于四川省的报道中就谈到乐至县，今年年初制成了一百二十一部土机床，经过半年多的不断改进，现在机床数量增加到三百八十多部，而且大部分木制或铁木结构的土机床，已经改变为全部铁制的、半土半洋的或者初步现代化的机床。这说明了什么呢？说明了：从土到洋，由低到高是事物发展的过程。我们何尝喜欢落后。我们革命的目的之一就是击败落后。然而我们懂得脚必须踏在地上才能走路，如果我们脱离实际脱离群众，就永远不能战胜落后。“大洋群”和“小土群”都是我们高速度地打败落后的方法。如果我们只有“大洋群”这一条腿，那末，四川省的许多县、区和人民公社的农具站，就不可能在一年中每个站都装备起五部或者三部车床。小的，土的，看起来暂时还是落后的，但却具有无限的生命力，因为它是发展的。那些指手划脚攻击“小土群”的人，有两个致命的缺点：一是不相信群众的巨大的创造力；一是根本不懂得一个普通的辩证法的道理：新生事物在表面上看起来虽然是弱小的，但它的发展前途却是伟大的不可战胜的。
    我们十分自豪，因为我们有了鞍钢、武钢、包钢、长春汽车厂、洛阳拖拉机厂、上海机床厂、吉林化工厂、北京电子管厂、哈尔滨电机厂、石家庄制药厂等等现代化的大企业；我们也十分自豪我们有了成百上千的中小钢铁厂、中小机械厂、中小农具厂、中小化肥厂、中小农药厂、中小煤矿、中小石油厂、土铁路、土硫酸厂、土化肥厂。两条战线，同时进军，这是我们的致胜之路。此路直通我们建设社会主义的伟大目标。
