Xinhua News Agency, November 4th - The world-renowned Hungarian Olympic Fencing Team held a friendly match with the Beijing Fencing Team this afternoon and evening. The Hungarian male and female athletes demonstrated their outstanding fencing skills in the competition.

Of the Hungarian team participating in the friendly match, the four female athletes were members of the women's foil team that won the World Fencing Championships this year. Among the eleven male athletes, eight were Hungarian champions, former world champions, current world champions, or members of world champion teams.

Today was the first time Chinese fencers had participated in an international competition. The Beijing team is an even younger fencing team, with an average age of less than twenty-two, and most of the athletes have only been fencing for one or two years. However, they showed great courage in front of the veteran players. Their footwork was flexible, their style was unique, and they often threatened their opponents with long-distance rapid attacks. However, generally speaking, they showed a lack of experience.

In the sabre competition, the Hungarian veteran and world champion this year, Kárpáti, left a very deep impression on people.

After the friendly match, Li Da, Deputy Director of the Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China, met with all the athletes.

    匈击剑队同北京队友谊赛
    新华社4日讯　世界闻名的匈牙利奥林匹克击剑队今天下午和晚上同北京击剑队举行了友谊赛。匈牙利的男、女健将们在比赛中显示了他们在剑术方面的卓越才能。
    参加友谊赛的匈牙利队中，四名女运动员是今年世界击剑锦标赛的女子轻剑团体冠军队，十一名男子选手中，有八名是匈牙利冠军、前世界冠军、目前的世界冠军或世界冠军队的成员。
    我国击剑运动员今天是第一次参加国际比赛。北京队更是一支年轻的击剑队，全队平均年龄不到二十二岁，大部分选手从事击剑运动只有一两年的历史。但是他们在久经战场的老将面前表现得十分勇猛。步法灵活，风格独特，常以远距离疾击的战术威胁对方。不过总的说来表现经验不足。
    花式剑比赛中，匈牙利的老将、今年世界冠军卡尔帕蒂给人们留下很深刻的印象。
    友谊赛结束后，中华人民共和国体育运动委员会副主任李达接见了全体运动员。
