Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, stated at a mass meeting held in Beijing tonight that the Chinese people warmly support the just struggle for the peaceful reunification of Korea. Bao Erhan said that China and Korea are neighbors, and the people of the two countries are as close as brothers; the struggle of the Korean brothers is our own struggle.

The meeting today was jointly held by the Sino-Korean Friendship Association and the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace. The meeting invited Li Yonghao, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, to give a report on the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea.

Before Ambassador Li Yonghao's report, Bao Erhan spoke first, saying that the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea passed a letter to the South Korean authorities and the South Korean people on October 27th, calling on them to unite and force the U.S. military to withdraw from South Korea and strive for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. It also sent letters to parliaments of various countries, calling on parliaments and peace-loving people of all countries to support the Korean people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and to support the Korean people's demand that all foreign aggressor troops, headed by the U.S. military, withdraw from South Korea. Bao Erhan said that the Chinese people warmly support the suggestions and appeals of the Korean Supreme People's Assembly, which fully conform to the interests of the Korean people and the people of the world. China and Korea have forged an unbreakable friendship with blood in the war against imperialist aggression, and the struggle of the Korean brothers is our own struggle. He warmly welcomed Ambassador Li Yonghao to give a report on behalf of the people from all walks of life present at the meeting.

In his report, Ambassador Li Yonghao talked about the history of the Korean people's struggle for peaceful reunification, the important proposals recently put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to strive for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and the military, political, and economic crisis in South Korea.

Ambassador Li Yonghao said that the plan for peaceful reunification of the fatherland recently proposed by the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the most realistic and only way to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea. It reflects the unanimous desire of all Korean people who long for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. It is in line with the national interests of the Korean people and also fully in line with the interests of world peace. He emphasized that now is the time for the U.S. military to withdraw, and it is time for all Korean people to mobilize and concentrate all their strength to achieve the reunification of the fatherland. We believe that as long as the entire Korean nation, regardless of political views and beliefs, rises up together, it will be able to tear down the wall blocking the north and south, and the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops will have to get out of South Korea. With the active support of the people of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving forces around the world, the Korean people will surely gloriously complete their lofty revolutionary task.

After Ambassador Li Yonghao's report, Bao Erhan expressed his gratitude to the Ambassador on behalf of the people from all walks of life present at the meeting. He said that the Chinese people have always believed that the reunification of Korea is a matter for the Korean people themselves and oppose foreign interference, and resolutely demand that foreign aggressor troops, headed by the U.S. military, withdraw from South Korea. The fact that U.S. imperialism stubbornly refuses to withdraw its troops from South Korea is part of the overall conspiracy of the United States to create tension and carry out aggressive activities in the Far East. Bao Erhan said that U.S. imperialism openly insists on occupying our territory of Taiwan for a long time and clamors to use force to interfere in our internal affairs; at the same time, it accelerates the arming of Japan, supports Japanese militarism, and instigates the Sananikone government to provoke civil war in Laos. All this directly threatens peace in Asia and the world.

Bao Erhan finally emphasized that the United States' attempt to permanently occupy South Korea will never be allowed to continue. The U.S. military must withdraw from South Korea, and the Korean issue must be resolved by the Korean people themselves. Korea should belong to the Korean people and will surely belong to the Korean people.

Among those present at today's meeting were Wei Chuantong, Vice President of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, Xi Zhanyuan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Liu Qingyang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, Zhang Chao, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

    中朝友协与和大在首都举行群众大会
    支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国
    据新华社11日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席包尔汉在今天晚上北京举行的一次群众大会上，表示中国人民热烈支持和平统一朝鲜的正义斗争。包尔汉说，中朝两国互为毗邻，两国人民骨肉相连，朝鲜兄弟的斗争就是我们自己的斗争。
    今天的大会是由中朝友好协会和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会联合举行的。大会邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻华大使李永镐作了关于和平统一朝鲜问题的报告。
    包尔汉在李永镐大使报告之前首先讲话，他说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议在10月27日通过了给南朝鲜当局和南朝鲜人民的信，号召他们团结一致，迫使美军撤出南朝鲜，争取祖国的和平统一。并且发出了给各国议会的信，呼吁各国议会和爱好和平的各国人民支持朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一的正义斗争，支持朝鲜人民要求以美军为首的一切外国侵略军撤出南朝鲜。包尔汉说，中国人民热烈支持朝鲜最高人民会议的这种完全符合朝鲜人民和世界人民利益的建议和呼吁，中朝两国在反抗帝国主义侵略的战争中以鲜血凝成了牢不可破的友谊，朝鲜兄弟的斗争就是我们自己的斗争。他代表到会各界人民热烈欢迎李永镐大使作报告。
    李永镐大使在报告中谈到了关于朝鲜人民和平统一斗争的历史、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最近为争取祖国和平统一而提出的重要建议，以及南朝鲜的军事、政治和经济危机。
    李永镐大使说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议最近提出的关于和平统一祖国的方案，是促进朝鲜和平统一的最现实的唯一途径，反映了渴望祖国和平统一的全体朝鲜人民一致的愿望，它是符合朝鲜人民的民族利益，而且也完全符合世界和平的利益。他强调说，现在，是美军撤走的时候了，是全朝鲜人民动员起来集中一切力量实现祖国统一的时候了，我们相信，只要全朝鲜民族不分政治见解和信仰，一致奋起，就能推倒阻挡在南北之中的墙壁，美帝国主义侵略军队就不得不从南朝鲜滚出去。朝鲜人民一定能够在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界爱好和平力量的积极支持下，光荣地完成自己崇高的革命任务。
    李永镐大使报告以后，包尔汉代表到会的各界人民向大使表示感谢。他说，中国人民从来就认为朝鲜的统一是朝鲜人民自己的事情，反对外国进行干涉，坚决要求以美军为首的外国侵略军撤出南朝鲜。美帝国主义顽固地拒绝从南朝鲜撤军，是美国在远东制造紧张局势，进行侵略活动的整个阴谋计划的一部分。包尔汉说，美帝国主义公开坚持长期侵占我国领土台湾，叫嚣要用武力来干涉我国内政；与此同时，加速武装日本，扶植日本军国主义，在老挝唆使萨纳尼空政府挑起内战。这一切都直接威胁着亚洲和世界的和平。
    包尔汉最后强调地说，美国企图永远霸占南朝鲜，这种局面决不容许长此继续下去，美军必须撤出南朝鲜，朝鲜问题必须由朝鲜人民自己来解决，朝鲜应该属于朝鲜人民，也必将属于朝鲜人民。
    出席今天大会的有中朝友好协会副会长魏传统，中华全国总工会书记处书记郗占元，全国妇联副主席刘清扬，全国青联副主席张超，以及首都各界人民。
