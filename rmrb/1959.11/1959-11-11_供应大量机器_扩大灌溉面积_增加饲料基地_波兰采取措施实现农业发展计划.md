Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 10th. According to the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee, Poland is taking various measures in agricultural mechanization, water conservancy construction, and expansion of feed bases to realize a huge plan for developing agriculture.

    In order to mechanize the cultivation of one-third of Poland's land by 1959, the state has established an agricultural development fund starting this year. This year alone, the agricultural teams have been allocated 700 million zlotys (Polish currency) from the agricultural development fund for the purchase of machinery. In recent months, farmers across the country have used this fund to purchase 1,700 tractors. According to the resolution of the Economic Committee of the Polish Council of Ministers, in the next six years, Poland's agricultural machinery production will be doubled compared with the present. In addition, machinery will also be imported from foreign countries. This year, 4,310 large and small agricultural machines have been imported from countries such as Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and the Soviet Union.

    Another major measure for Poland's agricultural development is water conservancy construction and expansion of irrigation area. At present, rural areas across the country are digging ditches for drainage, building sluices, and repairing canals. Nine thousand water conservancy and soil improvement teams have been organized in rural areas, with the participation of 120,000 farmers. The state will invest heavily in the construction of water conservancy projects. Before 1965, state investment will be doubled compared with 1958. The irrigated area of cultivated land will be expanded to 2 million hectares.

    Establishing a feed base is one of the central tasks of Poland's livestock development. This year, Polish rural areas have already started to expand the feed base. Under the initiative of rural agricultural teams, 5,000 pastures and grassland cultivation groups have been established across the country. The state has allocated 200 million zlotys to help farmers expand pastures and breed livestock.

    供应大量机器　扩大灌溉面积　增加饲料基地
    波兰采取措施实现农业发展计划
    据新华社华沙10日电　根据波兰统一工人党二中全会的决议，波兰在农业机械化、兴修水利、扩大饲料基地方面采取各种措施，实现发展农业的巨大计划。
    为了到1959年使波兰三分之一的土地的耕作实现机械化，从今年起，国家建立了发展农业基金。仅仅今年拨交农业小组为购买机器使用的发展农业基金就达七亿兹罗提（波币名）。最近几个月期间，全国各地农民用这种基金购买的拖拉机就达一千七百台。根据波兰部长会议经济委员会的决议，在未来的六年期间，波兰农业机器生产要比现在增加两倍，此外，还将从外国进口机器。今年从捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、苏联等国家就进口了四千三百一十台大小农业机器。
    波兰发展农业的另一巨大措施是兴修水利、扩大灌溉面积。目前全国农村正在挖沟排水，建闸修渠。农村已经组织起九千个经营水利和改良土壤的小组，参加的农民有十二万人。国家将大力投资，兴建水利工程。在1965年前，国家投资要比1958年增加二倍。要扩大耕地灌溉面积达二百万公顷。
    建立饲料基地是波兰发展畜牧业的中心任务之一。今年来，波兰农村就已着手进行扩大饲料基地的工作。在农村农业小组的倡议下，全国成立了五千个牧场、草地耕作组。国家拨出了二亿兹罗提帮助农民扩大牧场和繁殖牲畜。
