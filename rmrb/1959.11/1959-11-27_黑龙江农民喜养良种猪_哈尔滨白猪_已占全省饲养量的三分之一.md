Xinhua News Agency, Harbin: "Harbin White Pigs" are found throughout Heilongjiang. One-third of the province's existing pigs are of this fine breed.

"Harbin White Pigs" have white hair all over their bodies, mature early, grow fast, have strong fattening ability, are rich in fat, and have delicious meat. This type of pig has strong cold resistance and strong adaptability to the environment. Generally, a sow produces about ten piglets per litter. Piglets weigh more than two pounds at birth and can reach more than twenty-four pounds after weaning. They can grow to one hundred and ten pounds after six months and can be sent to the market after ten months, generally weighing about two hundred and fifty pounds.

The daily weight gain of this type of pig is also high. According to different feeding methods, it takes about one hundred days of fattening time to go from sixty pounds to two hundred pounds, with an average daily weight gain of one to one and a half pounds per pig. The amount of feed required for each pound of weight gain is four and five-ninths pounds.

"Harbin White Pigs" originated in the Harbin area of Heilongjiang Province. This type of pig has a history of over sixty years. Its bloodline is relatively complex, mainly based on large and medium-sized Yorkshire and Soviet Siberian native pigs, mixed with some Berkshire and local Chinese pig bloodlines. It was formed through a long-term, repeated crossbreeding with local pigs. In recent years, this type of pig has attracted the attention of many provinces (regions). Southern provinces and the Gansu area in the northwest have introduced "Harbin White Pigs" to crossbreed and improve local pigs. (Attached pictures)

    黑龙江农民喜养良种猪
    “哈尔滨白猪”已占全省饲养量的三分之一
    新华社哈尔滨讯　“哈尔滨白猪”遍布黑龙江各地，黑龙江省现有的猪中，有三分之一是这种优良猪。
    “哈尔滨白猪”全身长着白毛，成熟期早，生长快，肥育能力强，脂肪丰富，肉味鲜美。这种猪有较强的抗寒能力，对环境的适应性强。一般母猪每窝产仔十头左右。仔猪初生时体重二斤以上，离奶后可达二十四斤以上，生后六个月就可以长到一百一十斤，长到十个月就可出圈供应市场，一般体重达二百五十斤左右。
    这种猪的日增重量也高，根据不同的喂养方法试验，从体重六十斤到二百斤约需一百天的肥育时间，平均每头猪日增重为一斤到一斤半。每增重一斤所需饲料量为四、五九斤。
    “哈尔滨白猪”产于黑龙江省哈尔滨地区。这种猪已有六十来年的历史，它的血缘较复杂，主要以大、中型约克夏和苏联西伯利亚土种猪为基础，并掺杂部分巴克夏和中国本地猪的血缘，经过较长期的、反复的和本地猪进行杂交培育形成。近几年来，这种猪已经引起了许多省（区）的重视，南方各省及西北的甘肃一带都引进了“哈尔滨白猪”，与当地猪进行杂交改良。（附图片）
