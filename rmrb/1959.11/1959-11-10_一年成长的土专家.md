    A native iron smelting plant was born at the foot of the North Mountain in Mafang Village, Xining City, Qinghai Province during the Great Leap Forward last year. Now this plant has become a combination of native and foreign methods with one 13-cubic-meter and six 3-cubic-meter blast furnaces. In the past year or so, the pig iron produced by this plant has strongly supported the production and construction of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry in Qinghai Province.

    When you walk into the Xining Iron and Steel Plant and see the hundreds of workers who are skillfully charging, tapping the iron, and removing slag, it is hard to imagine that a year ago they were still farmers, herdsmen, and construction workers. Lu Yiyou, an eighteen-year-old furnace leader from a peasant background, had never even seen iron smelting a year ago, but now he has become a native iron smelting expert who is proficient in judging furnace temperature, charging, and tapping the iron.

    Encouraged by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Xining Iron Plant, which is advancing in great strides, achieved an average utilization coefficient of 1.15 for small blast furnaces in October, and the quality reached 96% for twenty-four days in October, completing this year's production plan two months ahead of schedule.

    一年成长的土专家
    在青海省西宁市马坊村的北山脚下，去年大跃进中诞生了一座土法炼铁厂。现在这个厂已经变成了拥有一座十三立方米和六座三立方米高炉的土洋结合的炼铁厂了。一年多来，这个厂所生产的生铁，有力地支援了青海省工、农、牧业的生产和建设。
    当你走进西宁炼铁厂，看到那些正在熟练地下料、打出铁口、除渣的成百名工人，很难想到在一年以前他们还是农民、牧民和建筑工人。十八岁的农民出身的炉长吕益友，一年前，炼铁的事儿见都没有见过，现在却成了看炉温、下料、打铁口件件精通的炼铁土专家了。
    阔步前进中的西宁铁厂，在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，10月份小高炉平均利用系数达到一点一五，10月份有二十四天的质量达到了96％，已经提前两个月完成今年生产计划。
