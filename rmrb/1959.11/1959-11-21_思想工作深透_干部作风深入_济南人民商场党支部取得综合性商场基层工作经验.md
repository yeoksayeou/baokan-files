    Thorough Ideological Work, In-depth Cadre Style
    Jinan People's Department Store Party Branch Achieves Grassroots Work Experience in Comprehensive Department Store

    (Our dispatch) How to strengthen the grassroots work of the Party, give play to the role of the Party organization as a fighting fortress, and mobilize and organize all employees to continuously oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy in a comprehensive department store is a problem worthy of attention. The Party Branch of Jinan People's Department Store in Shandong Province has initially gained some experience in this regard.

    Unifying ideological understanding and giving play to the backbone role of Party members is one of the experiences of the Party branch of this department store. The People's Department Store has a total of thirty-four industries, forty-seven natural store departments, and a total of more than seven hundred employees, with only twenty-one Party members. In view of this situation, the Party branch of this department store pays special attention to strengthening the ideological education of Party members and giving play to the active and exemplary role of Party members. In this regard, the methods they have adopted of holding Party classes once every half month and conducting evaluations once a month have played a very good role. Wherever there are difficulties in supply work, Party members go there. During the National Day supply work, Wang Yongmao got up early and went to bed late, leading the employees to carry out shock work together. Under the leadership of the Party members, all tasks were completed very well. In terms of improving service quality, the Party branch organized Party members to study and discuss, and put forward the methods of relying on street residents, increasing supply points, and providing home delivery services. Many Party members took the lead in improving their service attitude. Probationary Party member and barber Yi Huishun took the lead in going to factories to give haircuts to workers, who were very touched; other employees also learned from him and used their spare time to go deep into residents' homes to carry out work.

    Grasping the political and ideological education of employees is the second experience of this Party branch. In the previous period, employees had many vague understandings of the views that commercial work should serve politics, serve production, and serve the masses, which manifested as a passive attitude of "selling whatever is available" and "waiting for customers to come to the door." The branch, through summarizing and checking work, mobilized employees to specifically discuss why commercial employees must establish the three major viewpoints. In the airing of views and debates, employees put forward more than two thousand opinions, examined vague thoughts, and expressed their attitudes. Subsequently, the branch organized all employees to deeply study the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which further boosted the morale of the employees. On the basis of the ideological improvement of the vast number of employees, a vigorous socialist emulation campaign of learning from, catching up with, and surpassing the advanced was launched, developing from group competitions, opponent competitions, and "one-dragon" competitions to store-to-store and department store-to-department store competitions. Twenty-six major store departments all participated in store-to-store and department store-to-department store competitions, and 96% of employees participated in the competition movement. The employees put forward the slogan of "Give customers small conveniences, leave all difficulties to ourselves" and formulated fifty-two service regulations, adding service items. At the same time, the branch led employees to actively improve the management system, and the entire department store implemented a three-level management and accounting system of department store, store department, and business group, with three fixed quotas (funds, personnel, and labor efficiency) and five guarantees (sales, service attitude, property management, saving expenses, and cleanliness and hygiene), achieving that everything has special responsibility and everyone manages the enterprise, giving full play to the enthusiasm of the masses. In this way, the appearance of the department store has greatly changed, and the variety of goods has increased by more than four thousand, accelerating the turnover of working capital and reducing management expenses, and the average daily turnover per person has increased from seventy-two yuan in May to one hundred and thirty-two yuan in October. From July to October, the entire department store received more than 19,000 commendatory opinions from the masses.

    Improving working methods and implementing the mass line is the third experience of this Party branch. The Party branch of the People's Department Store has always implemented the working principle of collective leadership and division of labor with individual responsibility. They are divided into three fronts, namely: political and ideological work (Party class education, employee education, personnel management, welfare, etc.), vigorously carrying out mass movements (organizing competitions, promoting advanced experience, etc.), and business work. Each front has a committee member responsible for leadership. The branch also promptly arranges and explains tasks to the trade union and the Communist Youth League organizations according to the work of each period.

    The branch also resolutely implemented the working method of following the mass line. For example, in carrying out the "zero-error store" movement, the branch fully mobilized employees to deliberate and discuss, and put forward eight measures to eliminate errors, which achieved good results. The error rate in September was 0.013%, and twenty-one store departments had basically eliminated errors.

    The Party Branch of Jinan People's Department Store also cares very much about the lives of employees and pays attention to arranging employees' work, study, and rest time. Since the third quarter, this branch, through studying the business rules of various industries in the entire department store, has mobilized employees to offer suggestions and ideas on properly arranging working hours, doing a good job, and improving efficiency. The branch, based on these opinions, adjusted working hours and restored the holiday system. At present, all store departments in this department store generally extend their external business hours, while the actual working hours of employees are shortened by three hours compared to the past, ensuring that employees have eight hours of sleep, four hours of eating and rest, and two hours of study or meeting time every day. In this way, employees are in high spirits and their enthusiasm for work is constantly rising. The employees of the Baiyun Barber Shop, according to the busy and slack rules and the technical level of the staff, adopted the method of "less shifts during slack periods, more shifts during slightly busy periods, and full shifts during very busy periods, staggered shifts and rotating breaks," and the external business hours increased from thirteen hours to fourteen and a half hours in the past, while the actual working hours of employees were much shorter than in the past.

    思想工作深透　干部作风深入
    济南人民商场党支部取得综合性商场基层工作经验
    本报讯　在综合性的商场，如何加强党的基层工作，发挥党组织的战斗堡垒作用，动员和组织全体职工不断反右倾，鼓干劲，开展增产节约运动，是一个值得注意的问题。山东省济南市人民商场党支部，已经在这方面初步摸到了一些经验。
    统一思想认识，发挥党员骨干作用，是这个商场党支部的经验之一。人民商场共有三十四种行业，四十七个自然门市部，职工总数七百余人，党员只有二十一名。针对这一情况，这个商场的党支部特别注意加强党员的思想教育，发挥党员的积极模范作用。在这方面，它们采取的每半月上一次党课、每月一次评比的方法，起了很好的作用。在供应工作中，那里有困难，党员就到那里去。王永茂在国庆节供应工作中，早起晚睡，带动职工一起突击。在党员们的带动下，各项工作完成的很好。在提高服务质量方面，党支部组织党员研究讨论，提出了依靠街道群众和增设供应点、送货上门的办法。很多党员带头改善了服务态度。预备党员、理发员伊会顺带头下厂，给工人理发，工人很受感动；其他职工也都向他学习，利用空闲时间，深入居民家中开展工作。
    抓职工政治思想教育，是这个党支部的经验之二。前一时期，职工们在商业工作为政治服务、为生产服务、为群众服务的观点上，存在许多模糊认识，表现为消极的“有啥卖啥”和“等客上门”的态度。支部通过总结检查工作，发动职工专门讨论了商业职工为什么必须树立三大观点。在鸣放辩论中，职工们提出两千多条意见，检查了模糊思想，表示了态度。接着，支部又组织全场职工深入学习了八中全会文件，进一步鼓舞了职工的干劲。在广大职工思想提高的基础上，又开展了轰轰烈烈的学、赶、超、帮竞赛运动，从小组赛、对手赛、“一条龙”赛，发展到店际、场际竞赛。二十六个主要门市部，全部参加了店、场际赛，96％的职工投入竞赛运动。职工们提出“微小便利给顾客，万般困难留自己”的口号，并制定了五十二项服务守则，增添了服务项目。同时，支部领导职工积极改进经营管理制度，全场实行了场、门市部、营业小组三级管理核算的三定（资金、人员、劳动效率）五包、（进销、服务态度、财产管理、节约费用、整洁卫生）的民主管理制度，做到了事事有专责，人人管企业，充分发挥了群众的积极性。这样，商场面貌大为改观，商品品种又增加了四千余种，加速了流动资金的周转和降低了管理费用，每人每日平均营业额由5月份的七十二元上升到10月份的一百三十二元。7至10月份，全商场收到群众表扬意见一万九千多条。
    改进工作方法，贯彻群众路线，是这个党支部的经验之三。人民商场党支部始终贯彻执行集体领导和分工负责的工作原则。他们分有三条战线，即：政治思想工作（党课教育、职工教育、人事管理、生活福利等）、大搞群众运动（组织竞赛、推广先进经验等）、业务工作。各条线都有一个委员负责领导。对工会和共青团组织，支部也根据每个时期的工作，及时布置交代任务。
    支部还坚决贯彻了走群众路线的工作方法。如在开展“无差错商店”运动中，支部充分发动职工酝酿讨论，提出八项消灭差错的措施，收到良好效果。9月份差错率为万分之一点三，并有二十一个门市部基本上消灭了差错。
    济南市人民商场党支部还非常关心职工生活，注意安排职工的工作、学习和休息时间。第三季度以来，这个支部通过研究整个商场各行业的营业规律，发动职工就妥善安排工作时间、做好工作、提高效率等方面，献策献计。支部根据这些意见，调整了工作时间，恢复了假期制度。目前，这个商场所有门市部一般都延长了对外营业时间，而职工的实际工作时间，却比过去缩短了三个小时，保证职工每天有八小时睡眠，四小时吃饭、休息和两小时的学习或开会时间。这样，职工情绪饱满，劳动热情不断高涨。白云理发店职工，根据忙闲规律和工作人员的技术水平，采取“闲时少上，小忙多上，大忙全上的穿插上班、轮流休息”的办法，对外营业时间由过去的十三小时增加到十四小时半，而职工的实际工作时间，却比过去缩短很多。
