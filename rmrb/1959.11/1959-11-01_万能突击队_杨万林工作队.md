The All-Purpose Commando Unit – The Yang Wanlin Work Team

Yang Wanlin is the captain and Party Branch Secretary of the mixed work team of the Fifth Work Zone of the First Company of the Third Construction Bureau of Gansu Province. Since its establishment in June 1952, the work team he leads has held high the red flag, overcome numerous difficulties, and overfulfilled the state plan year after year and month after month. On the basis of completing the First Five-Year Plan two years, four months, and twenty days ahead of schedule, they completed the Second Five-Year Plan three years and three and a half months ahead of schedule, and victoriously entered 1963 on September 16, 1959. At the same time, they saved a large amount of building materials and achieved eight years of glorious accident-free operation.

This team, initially with only eighteen workers, was named the "Youth Commando Unit" in 1955, maintaining the honorary title of advanced collective for twenty-six consecutive times, and attended three advanced producer representative conferences in Gansu Province. Yang Wanlin was rated as an advanced producer for twenty-seven consecutive times and received more than forty awards. In 1956, Yang Wanlin, with the glorious achievements of the entire team, attended the National Advanced Producers Conference and met the beloved leader Chairman Mao. In 1958, they were awarded the honorary title of "All-Purpose Commando Unit." In September 1959, at the National Construction and Installation Conference, they were officially named the "Yang Wanlin Mixed Work Team," becoming a model for the national construction industry.

Facing Difficulties and Overcoming Difficulties

Relying on the leadership of the Party and fully exerting the fortress role of the Party organization within the team is the fundamental guarantee for the mixed work team to achieve various achievements. Since its establishment in 1952, they have consistently and resolutely implemented the Party's policies and instructions, and earnestly mobilized the masses, thus successfully completing the state plan every year. In the process of executing production tasks, they often disregarded the ridicule of the conservatives, adhered to the construction policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical," and carried out an irreconcilable struggle against "less, slower, worse, and more expensive."

In 1958, the task of laying ceramic tiles for the No. 109 project of the Lanzhou Refinery was a large task, and at the time, no one knew how to lay them. Upon hearing this news, Yang Wanlin approached the foreman several times to request this task, but the foreman refused to issue the task order, saying, "You can't do it." After repeated requests, the task was finally assigned. With the support and assistance of the Party organization, they studied, visited, and held discussions with brother work zones, and after repeated trials for fifteen or sixteen times, they finally learned the skill of laying ceramic tiles. However, due to unfamiliarity with the operating techniques, the experiment only reached 60% of the quota and was reworked twice. So, some people sarcastically said: "Red soil as vermilion – overestimating one's abilities." Difficulties and sarcasm did not shake their confidence. Yang Wanlin personally took the lead, with each grade-five worker leading a grade-four worker, and then the grade-four worker leading a grade-three worker. In this way, the entire team not only quickly and universally mastered this technique, but also exceeded the task by 65%, with all quality being excellent. The conservatives had to bow their heads and admit defeat in the face of the facts.

When accepting all the tasks for the thirty-five manholes of the No. 181 project (earthwork, formwork, concrete pouring), they initially underestimated the difficulty of the task. Difficulties arose after two days of work. The work was more than ten meters deep, four to five meters below the water level. On the third day, the water rose, and one pump could not pump it all out. Moreover, there was a danger of collapse when people operated below. Under the threat of a serious accident, they had to stop work. However, the construction period was tight, and the failure to complete this task would prevent more than 3,000 cubic meters of backfill from being filled, directly affecting the test run of the pump house. Two days had passed since the shutdown, and they were still at a loss. Finally, they asked the Party organization for instructions and, according to the Party's general branch instruction to "mobilize everyone to think of solutions," mobilized the masses overnight to come up with ideas and solutions. After a mass debate, a brilliant plan emerged: increase a water pump, implement three-shift operation to prevent the water from rising, dig down one layer, lower a layer of formwork, and the lower layer would no longer collapse, and correspondingly change the labor organization. In this way, the original plan of twenty-eight days was completed seventeen days ahead of schedule, and the quality was well received and praised by the client.

In the face of many arduous tasks, the Party members in the team took the lead and influenced the masses with practical actions. For example, when tiling the roof of Building No. 91, the construction period was tight, and the roof slope was steep, requiring aerial work. Yang Wanlin and another Party member stepped forward and worked upside down in the air late into the night, successfully completing the task. The workers admired and said: "Master Yang is really an iron man." Over the past seven years, twenty-eight team members in Yang Wanlin's team have gloriously joined the Party.

Eight Years of Glorious Accident-Free Operation

This advanced collective not only successfully completed the state plan but also ensured project quality, achieved safe production, and established a complete set of technical management systems – drawing filing system, three-level technical disclosure system, three-level inspection system, etc., achieving an all-round leap forward of "more, faster, better, more economical, and safer," and becoming a brilliant banner of eight years of accident-free operation.

The drawing filing system, also known as the technical handover card, lists the project object on a large table, indicating the quantity, progress, completion date, work quota, quality and safety requirements, who is responsible for the specific parts, etc. There are two copies (one for the worker and one for the foreman). After the project is completed, the foreman's copy is accepted and filed for future reference. Because this system has clear and specific responsibilities, it can strengthen the worker's sense of responsibility and ensure project quality. The three-level technical disclosure system is: the project number discloses to the brigade, the brigade discloses to the team, and the team discloses to the workers level by level. Workers can hear three disclosures, the methods are gradually detailed, and the measures are easy to implement. The system comes from the masses and is deeply welcomed by the masses, thus establishing an orderly construction order in the construction process and providing a reliable guarantee for project quality. For example, the original design elevation of the "K-5" tower in Unit 2 was 10.6 meters, and the column cross-section was only 40 × 40 cm. After the drawings were reviewed, the workers saw that the cross-section was too small and believed that the strength was insufficient. After raising the issue, it was changed to 60 × 80 cm, preventing an accident from occurring. They also take any small problems that occur during construction seriously and try to overcome them. Once, when concrete worker Zhao Gan-ting was placing concrete on the "K-3" tower, there was a little pitting, which did not affect the quality, but due to the in-depth education on usual days, he felt very ashamed, and the team immediately investigated the reason and proposed preventive methods, thus eliminating similar problems in the future.

In order to ensure safe production, this team regularly discusses quality and safety issues every week or listens to lectures, and everyone in the team has established the idea that "safety is for production, and production must be safe" and "no quality, no quantity."

One Clever Hand Is Not As Good As Ten Thousand Skilled Hands

"Do whatever you do, change whatever you change" is the guiding ideology of the Yang Wanlin Mixed Work Team's technical innovation. Since 1952, Yang Wanlin and the team members he leads have been constantly reforming tools, operating methods, and labor organizations. In 1956, Yang Wanlin went to Beijing to participate in the Advanced Producers Conference and was greatly encouraged. After returning, he was determined to revolutionize technology. However, he took a detour. He began to look down on the slightest innovations, put down the "earth cycle mortar spreader," and wanted to create the world's first-class automatic mortar spreader. He fell into boundless fantasy. After the Party organization discovered this, it told him: "Having the ambition to reach the sky in one step also requires the meticulous work of stepping towards the sky step by step," "Don't underestimate some simple innovations, even if they improve work efficiency by half or double, but if thousands and tens of thousands of people improve, this is a great thing." These instructions pointed out the direction for Yang Wanlin. Yang Wanlin's determination to create also greatly inspired the staff of the entire team, liberating their thinking and opening up the way for technical innovation and technical revolution. In the practice of technical innovation, Yang Wanlin deeply realized the importance of pooling wisdom and benefiting from each other. For example, Yang Wanlin's invented mortar spreader initially had some problems. After it was brought out to meet the masses, everyone spoke up, and a twenty-minute "Zhuge Liang" meeting enabled the mortar spreader to move forward and backward. Truly, one clever hand is not as good as ten thousand skilled hands. In 1958, under the great call for technical revolution proposed by the Party, a mass technical revolution movement quickly formed. Whether it was a technician, an apprentice, an old worker, or a new worker, all were swept into the torrent of the movement. This team pooled its efforts and wisdom, creating and transforming 116 machines and tools from 1958 to July of this year, increasing work efficiency by one to seven times.

In the process of using new tools and adopting new operating methods, they also encountered some resistance, but they were able to use various methods to persuade and educate the masses. For example, when promoting the mortar spreader, the old technician Su Deshan said: "The mortar spreader is too tiring, and a large shovel is more convenient," "With a large shovel, everyone does their own thing, and it will not affect everyone because one person can't catch up." Some apprentices also believed that using a mortar spreader could not learn technology, and so on. In response to this situation, they asked Master Su Deshan to use a large shovel with his apprentices, and asked Master Zhou Jingzhou, who advocated using a mortar spreader, to "compete against each other" with Master Su, with apprentices. In half a day, the progress of the two brick walls differed by more than half. After work, they visited each other, and the next day, Master Su silently started using the mortar spreader.

Yang Wanlin's team's technical innovations have gone through a path of continuous development and continuous improvement from small to large, from low to high. For example, after the comprehensive bricklaying method was promoted, the mortar supply could not keep up, and the bricklaying speed was affected. Yang Wanlin found the old worker Li Kecai to ponder and make a "multi-bucket mortar truck," which increased work efficiency by one and a half times, reducing the mortar supply from eleven to five people; then the mortar mixing increased from five to eight people. The mismatch of fast and slow upper and lower processes made Yang Wanlin feel more and more important to match the upper and lower processes and various tool combinations. Under the combination of leaders, technicians, and workers, they created advanced tools such as spring wire hangers, circulating mortar spreaders, multi-bucket mortar trucks, hand-cranked mortar mixers, three-tooth seam equalizers, and line markers, realizing the combined matching of advanced tools in various construction processes.

Bringing advanced experience to brother teams and advancing together with brother teams is one of the characteristics of the Yang Wanlin Mixed Work Team in technical innovation. In July of this year, in order to ensure the progress of the key project of the water plant purification station, Yang Wanlin did not care about the heavy tasks of his own team, and would rather take out a set of mortar spreaders that were in use, and also sent two excellent old team members to support the "Leap Forward Bricklaying Team" until the members of the "Leap Forward Bricklaying Team" had mastered the operating methods of the advanced tools, and the work efficiency was increased by one and a half times, the people who were sent back to the team. With their help, the five or six teams in this work zone, which often failed to meet the quota in the past, have exceeded the set amount by an average of more than 30% since July, reaching an advanced production level.

The Construction Site Is a School, the Brigade Is a Family

Last autumn, with the Great Leap Forward in production, the number of new workers more than doubled. In order to help the new workers improve their consciousness, the old workers of Yang Wanlin's team often chatted with the new workers, talked about construction, told stories, recalled and compared the old and new societies, and donated materials to help them get through the winter. Therefore, the new workers were very stable in their emotions. Immediately afterwards, they launched the Red and Expert study, creating a "double 95-55" production study system. This system takes three days as a small cycle; in the first and second days of the three days, they produce for nine and a half hours each day, and on the third day, they produce for five and a half hours and study for four hours. Although the production time is still an average of eight hours per day within three days, the study period is concentrated, which is convenient for systematic study. Ten days is a large cycle, studying politics, technology, and culture separately, so that workers can get a comprehensive improvement. The specific approach is that the secretary takes the lead in person, the old workers serve as the backbone, and organizes advanced help to the backward and makes friends and talks to improve the level of political thought; uses a combination of classroom education and practical operation, as well as "on-site training," apprenticeship contracts, one teacher with multiple apprentices, and apprentices leading apprentices, to technically arm the new workers; at the same time, strengthen the ideological education of a comprehensive view of safety and quality. In this way, Yang Wanlin's team has successively trained and sent out 350 young workers with technical levels of two to four; and trained a large number of "multi-skilled workers." Now most of the technicians in Yang Wanlin's team have mastered fifteen technologies, and Yang Wanlin himself has become a skilled craftsman who has mastered nineteen technologies. This not only solved the difficulty of insufficient technical force, but also made the original single-skilled professional team a multi-skilled mixed work team.

The Yang Wanlin Mixed Work Team is not only a united collective but also a collective full of love, mutual assistance, and joy. On their construction site, songs, dances, poems, and articles praise the advanced, and good news is frequently reported with gongs and drums, working happily and feeling happy when resting.

    万能突击队——杨万林工作队
    杨万林是甘肃省第三工程局一公司五工区混合工作队的队长兼党支部书记。他领导的这支工作队从1952年6月建队以来，高举红旗，战胜了重重困难，年年月月超额完成了国家计划。在提前两年四个月零二十天完成第一个五年计划的基础上，又提前三年零三个半月完成了第二个五年计划，在1959年9月16日胜利地跨入了1963年。同时，他们节约了大量建筑材料，并作到了八年如一日，光荣无事故。
    这支队伍，最初只有十八名工人，1955年命名为“青年突击队”，连续二十六次保持了先进集体的光荣称号，出席了甘肃省的三次先进生产者代表会议。杨万林连续二十七次被评为先进生产者，先后受到四十多次奖励。1956年杨万林带着全队的光荣事迹，出席了全国先进生产者会议，见到了敬爱的领袖毛主席。1958年，他们获得了“万能突击队”的光荣称号，1959年9月全国建筑安装会上，正式命名为“杨万林混合工作队”，成为全国建筑业的标兵。
    迎向困难战胜困难
    依靠党的领导，充分发挥队内党组织的堡垒作用，是这个混合工作队取得各项成就的根本保证。1952年建队以来，他们一贯地、坚决地贯彻党的方针和指示，认真地发动群众，因而历年都出色地完成了国家计划。在执行生产任务过程中，他们常常不顾保守主义者们的冷嘲热讽，坚持执行多快好省的建设方针，与少慢差费进行不调和的斗争。
    1958年，兰州炼油厂一零九工号的铺磁砖工程，任务很大，当时没有人会铺。杨万林听到这一消息，几次找工长要求这个任务，工长都以“你们干不成”而拒绝给签发任务单。他们再三请求，最后把任务总算交下来了。他们便在党组织的支持和帮助下，到兄弟工区学习、参观、座谈，并经过反复十五、六次的试验，终于学会了铺磁砖的本领。但是，由于操作技术不熟练，在试验中只达到定额的60％，而且还返工两次。于是有人讽刺说：“红土作朱砂——自不量力”。困难和讽刺没有动摇他们的信心。杨万林亲自带头，每个五级工带一个四级工，后来四级工带三级工，这样，全队不仅迅速地、普遍地掌握了这门技术，并超额65％完成了任务，质量全部优等，保守主义者们在事实面前不得不低头服输了。
    在接受一八一工号三十五个阴井的全部任务（土方、支模、混凝土浇灌）的时候，开始他们对任务的困难估计不足，干了两天困难出现了。这个活有十米多深，低于水位四到五米，第三天水就上来了，一个泵顶着抽，也抽不完，而且人在下面一操作就有垮下来的危险。在严重的事故威胁下，只好停工。但是工期紧迫，加之这个任务完不成会使三千多立方米的回填土填不上，直接影响泵房的试车。停工两天了，仍然束手无策。最后他们请示了党组织，并根据党总支“发动大家想办法”的指示，连夜发动群众出主意、想办法。经过群众一场辩论，妙计出来了：增加一台水泵，实行三班作业，使水无法上来，同时往下挖一层，下一层模板，下层再不坍方了，并相应地改变了劳动组织。就这样，使原计划二十八天的工期，提前十七天完成了任务，在质量方面受到了甲方的好评和赞扬。
    在许多艰巨的任务面前，队里的党员都走在前面，用实际行动影响群众。例如，九一号楼屋面挂瓦，工期紧，屋面坡度陡，要悬空作业。杨万林就和另一党员挺身而出，倒悬空中，深夜奋战，出色地完成了任务。工人们都钦佩地说：“杨师傅真是个铁人。”七年来，杨万林队先后有二十八名队员光荣地入了党。
    八年如一日光荣无事故
    这个先进的集体不仅出色地完成了国家计划，并且确保了工程质量，作到了安全生产，建立了一套完整的技术管理制度——划图归档制、三级技术交底制、三级检查制等，实现了多快好省又安全的全面跃进，成为八年无事故的一面光辉旗帜。
    划图归档制也叫技术交接卡，它把工程对象列在一张大表上，标明数量、进度、完成日期、工作定额、质量安全要求，具体部分由何人施工等等，一式两份（工人、工长各一份），工程竣工以后，工长的一份验收归档备查。由于这个制度责任明确、具体，能够加强工人的责任感，确保工程质量。三级技术交底制是：工号向大队、大队向小队、小队向工人逐级交底。工人能听到三次交底，办法逐步细致，措施容易落实。制度来自群众，深受群众欢迎，从而在施工中建立了有条不紊的施工秩序，对工程质量提供了可靠的保证。如二单元“K—5”塔原设计标高十点六米，柱子截面仅40×40厘米，经图纸绘审以后，工人看出断面太小，认为强度不够。提出以后，就改成为60×80厘米，防止了事故的产生。在施工中偶而出了小毛病，他们也是认真对待，想法克服。一次，混凝土工赵感庭打“K—3”塔混凝土的时候，有一点麻面，本来对质量没有影响，但由于平时教育的深入，他感到很惭愧，小队也立即追查了这个原因，提出了防止方法，以后就杜绝了类似的毛病。
    为了确保安全生产，这个队每周都定期讨论质量安全问题或听人讲课，全队人人树立了“安全为了生产、生产必须安全”和“没有质量就没有数量”的思想。
    一双手巧不如万双手能
    “干什么，改什么”，是杨万林混合工作队技术革新的指导思想。从1952年起，杨万林和他领导的队员就不断地改革工具、操作方法和劳动组织。1956年，杨万林到北京参加先进生产者代表会议，受到了极大鼓舞，回去以后，他下决心革新技术。但他却走了一段弯路。开始看不起一点一滴的革新，放下了“土循环铺灰器”，想创造世界上第一流的自动铺灰器。他陷入了漫无边际的幻想。党组织发现以后，告诉他：“有了一步登天的雄心，还要有步步登天的细致工作”、“不要小看一些简单的革新，哪怕提高工效半倍、一倍，但几千几万人都提高了，这就是了不起的大事。”这些指示，给杨万林指出了方向。杨万林的创造决心，也大大启发了全队的职工，使他们解放了思想，为技术革新和技术革命开辟了道路。杨万林在技术革新的实践中，深深体会到集思广益的重要。如杨万林创造的铺灰器，最初还有些毛病，拿出来和群众见面以后，大家你一言我一语，二十分钟的“诸葛亮”会，就使这个铺灰器前后都能走动了，真是一双手巧，不如千万双手能。1958年，在党提出的技术革命的伟大号召下，群众性的技术革命运动迅速形成，不论技工、徒工，不论是老工人还是新工人，都卷入到运动的洪流里。这个队群策群力，从1958年到今年7月，共创造和改造机具一百一十六件，使工效提高一到七倍。
    在使用新工具和采用新的操作方法中，也曾经遇到一些阻力，可是他们能够运用各种方法，说服和教育群众。例如，老技工苏德山在推广铺灰器的时候说：“铺灰器太吃力，没有大铲方便”，“拿大铲各干各的，不会因一个人赶不上而影响大家”。有的徒工也认为使用铺灰器学不到技术，等等。他们针对这种情况，一面请苏德山师傅带着徒弟使用大铲，一面请主张用铺灰器的周景洲师傅带徒弟和苏师傅“唱对台戏”，半天时间，两面砖墙进度差了大半截。下班以后，互相参观了一下，苏师傅第二天不声不响地就用起了铺灰器。
    杨万林队的技术革新经过了由小到大，由低到高，不断发展、不断提高的道路。如综合砌砖法推广以后，运浆跟不上，砌砖速度受到影响，杨万林找老工人李克才琢磨制了个“多斗运灰车”，工效提高一倍半，供灰由十一人减到五人；接着合灰的却由五人增到八人。上下工序快慢不相适应的局面，使杨万林越想越感到上下工序和各种工具组合配套的重要。在领导、技术人员、工人三结合之下，他们创造了弹簧挂线器、循环铺灰器、多斗运灰车、手摇砂浆搅拌机、三齿匀缝器、划线器等先进工具，在建筑施工各项工艺中实现了先进工具的组合配套。
    把先进经验带给兄弟队组，和兄弟队组共同跃进，这是杨万林混合工作队在技术革新中的特点之一。今年7月，为了保证水厂净化站重点工程的进度，杨万林顾不得自己队的任务繁重，宁可把正使用的铺灰器抽出来一套，还派了两名优秀老队员去支援“跃进瓦工队”，直到“跃进瓦工队”队员都掌握了先进工具的操作方法，工效提高了一倍半，派去的人才回队来。在他们帮助下，这个工区过去经常达不到定额的五、六队，7月份以来，平均超过定超30％以上，达到了先进生产水平。
    工地是学校　大队是家庭
    去年秋天，随着生产大跃进，新工人猛增两倍以上。为了帮助新工人提高觉悟，杨万林队的老工人就经常和新工人扯家常，谈建设，讲故事，回忆对比新旧社会，并且捐增物资帮助过冬，因此，新工人情绪都很安定。紧接着，他们开展了红专学习，创造了“双95—55”生产学习制度。这个制度是把三天作一个小循环期；三天中间第一、二两天，每天生产九个半小时，第三天生产五个半小时，学习四个小时。虽然三天内生产时间仍然平均每天八小时，但是学习期间却集中了，便于系统学习了。十天为一个大循环期，分别学习政治、技术、文化，使工人得到全面的提高。具体的作法是，书记亲自挂帅，老工人作骨干，组织先进帮助落后和交友谈心，来提高政治思想水平；运用课堂教育和实际操作结合，以及“现场练兵”、师徒合同、一师多徒、以徒带徒等方式，从技术上武装新工人；同时加强安全质量全面观点的思想教育。就这样，杨万林队陆续培养和输送出三百五十名具有二到四级技术水平的青年工人；培养了大批“多面手”。现在杨万林队大部分技工都掌握了十五种技术，杨万林本人成为掌握十九种技术的能工巧匠。这样，不仅解决了技术力量不足的困难，并使原来单一工种的专业队成为多工种的混合工作队。
    杨万林混合工作队不但是一个团结的集体，也是一个充满了友爱、互助和欢乐的集体。在他们工地上，歌舞诗文颂先进，捷报频传锣鼓鸣，干活时干的痛快，休息时心情愉快。
