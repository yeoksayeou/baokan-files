    Tenaciously Promote Advanced Things
    Zhang Pinghua
    [Editor's note: This is a speech by Comrade Zhang Pinghua, First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, when he received the representatives of the National Congress of Heroes of Hunan Province. We have excerpted it from the New Hunan Daily as follows. The title was added by the editor. ]

    You went to Beijing to present "treasures" and obtain "scriptures," which means presenting good experiences to the Party, the country, the proletariat, and the people of the whole country. At the same time, you obtained the "scriptures" of Marxism-Leninism and learned many advanced experiences and advanced technologies. These things are very precious. Now that you have returned fully loaded, you should make these advanced things blossom and bear fruit throughout the province.

    In the process of promoting advanced experiences, you will inevitably encounter difficulties. Everyone must be fully prepared ideologically to overcome various difficulties, sweep away obstacles, and continue to move forward. Because there are three different attitudes towards advanced things and new things among the masses, cadres, and even within the Party: the first is an attitude of full enthusiasm and active support, firmly implementing advanced things; the second is an intermediate state, they neither oppose nor actively support, they hesitate and watch new things, they agree if they see it doing well, and they waver if they encounter difficulties, and there are quite a few of these people; the third is an attitude of opposition, they fear new things and oppose new things. They want to do everything the old way. If something new appears, if their ancestors haven't done it, their masters haven't taught it, and it's not written in books, they don't dare to do it, for fear of taking risks. They don't understand that the things of ancestors, masters, and books also had a first time. All good things are from scratch, from immature to mature, and all are constantly tested and improved, and constantly improved in practice, and then mature. These three attitudes reflect the class struggle in society, and also reflect the struggle between the new and the old, the advanced and the backward in transforming nature. This is a complex struggle, so promoting an advanced thing is not easy. We must be fully prepared ideologically, have a tenacious spirit, not be afraid of setbacks, and persevere in order to make advanced things blossom and bear fruit. At the same time, we must support the first type of people, improve the second type of people, and educate and transform the third type of people, and mobilize the broad masses, so that we can achieve victory.

    The current situation is extremely good, which is unprecedentedly favorable for promoting advanced things. Everyone should seize this favorable opportunity to sow their own good seeds. We must not only sow well, but also cultivate well, so that advanced seeds can continuously evolve, grow, blossom, and bear fruit. The question now is how to consolidate the new upsurge of mass movements and sustain its healthy development. The Party's general line of building socialism requires "more, faster, better, and more economical," and none of these four characters can be ignored. To consolidate and sustain the movement, we must work hard and cleverly. Hard work is the foundation. Without hard work, there is no clever work. But we cannot just work hard. We must also work cleverly. Only by working cleverly can we tap greater potential.

    顽强地推广先进事物
    张平化
    〔编者按：这是中共湖南省委第一书记张平化同志在接见湖南省全国群英会代表时的讲话，我们根据新湖南报摘录如下。题目是编者加的。〕
    你们到北京献“宝”，又取“经”回来，这就是把好经验献给党、献给国家、献给无产阶级、献给全国人民，同时又取得了马克思列宁主义的“经”，学到了许多先进经验和先进技术，这些东西非常宝贵，现在满载而归了，就应该使这些先进的东西在全省开花结果。
    在推广先进经验当中，是不会不遇到困难的，大家要有充分的思想准备，要克服各种困难，扫除障碍，继续前进。因为对于先进的东西和新生事物，在群众中、干部中，甚至在党内，都有三种不同的态度，一种是满腔热情，积极支持的态度，对待先进东西坚定不移的贯彻执行；第二种是中间状态，他们既不反对，也不积极赞成，对新生事物徘徊观望，看到搞得好也赞成，如果遇到困难就会动摇，这种人是比较多的；第三种是反对的态度，他们害怕新生事物，反对新生事物。一切愿意照老样子办事，出现一样新东西，如果祖宗没有干过，师傅没有教过，书本上没有写过，就不敢干，怕冒风险。他们不懂得，祖宗、师傅和书本上的东西也是有过第一次的。一切好的东西都是从无到有，由不成熟到成熟，都是经过不断试验改进，以及在实践中不断改进，然后成熟的。这三种态度，反映了社会上的阶级斗争，也反映了改造自然界中，新与旧，先进与落后的斗争，这是一场复杂的斗争，因此，推广一样先进的东西，并不是轻而易举的，必须有充分的思想准备，顽强的精神，不怕碰钉子，坚定不移的干下去，才能使先进的东西开花结果；同时要支持第一种人，提高第二种人，教育改造第三种人，把广大群众带动起来，我们就能够取得胜利。
    现在形势极好，对推广先进的东西，空前有利，大家应该把握这一有利时机，把自己的优良种子撒播出去，既要撒播得好，还要培养得好，才能使先进种子不断进化、生长、开花、结果。现在的问题是如何使新的群众运动高潮巩固起来，健康的持续的发展下去。党的建设社会主义总路线要求“多快好省”这四个字，一个也不能忽略。要使运动巩固起来持续下去，就要苦干加巧干，苦干是基础，没有苦干就没有巧干，但不能光是苦干，还要巧干，只有巧干，才能发掘出更大的潜力来。
