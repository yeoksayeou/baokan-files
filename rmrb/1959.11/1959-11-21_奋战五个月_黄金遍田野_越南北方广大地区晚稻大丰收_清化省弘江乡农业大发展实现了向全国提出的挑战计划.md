(Comprehensive Report by Our Newspaper) Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Good news of an unprecedented bumper harvest of late rice in northern Vietnam is pouring in.

Under the slogan "Five months of hard work, golden fields everywhere," the vast number of farmers are happily and comprehensively wielding their sickles to harvest. Currently, in the mountainous provinces of Cao Bang, Yen Bai, Lao Cai, Lang Son, Tuyen Quang, Quang Binh, Ha Tinh, and Nghe An, about half or two-thirds of the late rice has already been harvested.

This year, the late rice in most areas has grown better than in any previous year. In many counties of Lang Son province, the average yield per hectare reached 2,700 kilograms, an increase of 200 kilograms over last year, which was the province's best year. Most of the fields in Ha Tinh province are saline-alkali land with historically low yields, but this year the expected harvest per hectare will increase by 500 to 600 kilograms compared to the same period last year. Last year, Tan Loc Commune in Can Loc County of this province had an average late rice yield of 1,700 kilograms per hectare; this year, the yield per hectare increased by 900 kilograms. Hong Giang Commune in Thanh Hoa Province, which once initiated a competition among all communes in North Vietnam, harvested an average of 4,100 to 4,500 kilograms of dried grain per hectare.

Agricultural cooperatives in northern Vietnam have demonstrated their superiority in the late rice harvest. Initial harvesting indicates that the late rice yield per hectare in agricultural production cooperatives is around 3,000 to 5,000 kilograms, generally at least a 10% increase over previous years. Most of the rice fields in 114 agricultural production cooperatives in Lang Son province have yields of around 3,000 kilograms per hectare. Among them, the highland fields of two agricultural production cooperatives in Quynh Son Commune, Bac Son County, which previously yielded only 1,700 kilograms per hectare, achieved an average harvest of 3,100 kilograms per hectare this year due to ample fertilizer and water, an 82% increase compared to last year.

In the midstream and plain areas of the Red River, yields have also increased significantly compared to previous years. Ming Jin Agricultural Cooperative in Jianrui County, Jian An Province, harvested 13 hectares, with an average yield of 4,000 kilograms per hectare, including three hectares with an average harvest of nearly 5,000 kilograms per hectare. Hua Fu Agricultural Cooperative in Ying Shan County, Nghe An Province, located in an area prone to drought, has seen its per-unit area yield double compared to last year due to good water conservancy work. He Ping Agricultural Cooperative in Shu Chi County, Thai Binh Province, achieved an average yield of 4,300 kilograms per hectare in all densely planted fields.

Before the harvest, all agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams formulated harvesting work plans, rationally arranged labor, and fully prepared harvesting tools and transportation equipment. Supply and marketing cooperatives also promptly supplied agricultural tools.

Many agricultural cooperatives in Nam Dinh, Thanh Hoa, Phu Tho and other provinces manufactured thousands of simple carts, not only saving manpower but also increasing the speed of harvesting. In the past, Quang Binh Province suffered considerable losses during the harvest season due to flooding. This year, the province prepared thousands of wooden boats to be used in the rush transport work. Therefore, despite encountering a particularly large flood this year, the harvesting task was completed quickly and well.

Currently, more than 10,000 agricultural cooperatives in the entire north are preparing to distribute the first late rice harvest after the establishment of the cooperatives amidst the cheers of a bumper harvest.

Hanoi Dispatch of Our Newspaper, November 19th: According to reports in local newspapers today, Hong Giang Commune in Thanh Hoa Province, which challenged all communes in North Vietnam in this year's late-season production competition, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of late rice. The late rice harvesting work in the entire commune has now ended. According to preliminary calculations, the yield per hectare reached 3.6 to 4 tons of dried grain.

The reason for this unprecedented bumper harvest of late rice in the commune this year is that, under the leadership of the Party, the farmers of the entire commune universally adopted advanced farming techniques such as deep plowing, careful cultivation, appropriate dense planting, and increased fertilization. It is also the result of the victory of the farmers of the entire commune in fighting natural disasters such as drought and pests. In this year's late-season production, all cultivated land except for some individual households adopted dense planting methods. Among them, eleven agricultural cooperatives also adopted advanced dense planting methods for transplanting seedlings with row and plant spacing of 20x10, 15x15, or 17x17.

This year, a lot of farmyard manure, pond silt, green manure, and other fertilizers were applied throughout the commune, averaging 54 loads of fertilizer per "fen" of land (approx. 0.067 hectares).

The commune's rice fields were severely threatened by drought at the beginning of transplanting and when the rice was nearing maturity. Pest and diseases also occurred just before the harvest was about to begin, but the vigorous drought resistance and rush harvesting by the people of the entire commune ensured a bumper harvest of late rice.

Due to this year's bumper harvest of late rice, the income of two-thirds of the poor peasant households in the commune increased by 150 to 200 kilograms of rice compared to last year's late-season harvest. The lower-middle peasants generally increased their income or maintained the amount of the best harvest of the 1958 late rice crop. In this commune's late-season production, due to the thorough implementation of the policy of comprehensive late-season production, corn production also exceeded the original plan, and animal husbandry has also developed more than before. This year, the commune raised 378 calves, an increase of 19 from last year. 22,000 chickens were raised, an increase of 1,500 compared to last year. Some households raised 50 or 60 chickens, and an average of three pigs were raised for every two households.

This year's bumper harvest of late rice in Hong Giang Commune further demonstrates the superiority of agricultural cooperatives, so farmers in the commune who have not yet joined agricultural cooperatives are clamoring to join, greatly promoting the consolidation and development of agricultural cooperatives. At the beginning of the late-season production, the number of farm households participating in agricultural cooperatives accounted for only 50% of the total number of farm households in the commune, but now the commune has basically completed the primary agricultural cooperativization, with farm households participating in agricultural cooperatives accounting for 91.64% of the total number of farm households in the commune.

In addition, the 241 communes in northern Vietnam that competed with Hong Giang Commune in this year's late-season production, due to the adoption of advanced farming techniques, have mostly achieved better late rice harvests than in previous years.

    “奋战五个月　黄金遍田野”
    越南北方广大地区晚稻大丰收
    清化省弘江乡农业大发展实现了向全国提出的挑战计划
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：越南北方晚稻空前大丰收的喜报纷纷传来。
    在“奋战五个月，黄金遍田野”的口号下，广大农民正在喜气洋洋地全面挥镰收割。目前，属于山区的高平、安沛、老街、谅山、宣光、广平、河静、宜安等省的晚稻已经收割了一半或三分之二左右。
    大部分地区今年晚稻长得比过去任何一年都好。谅山省许多县平均每公顷产量达到二千七百公斤，比本省年成最好的去年增产二百公斤。河静省大部分田地都是盐碱地，产量一向很低，但今年预计每公顷收获量将比去年同期增加五百到六百公斤。这个省的干禄县新禄乡去年晚稻平均每公顷产量是一千七百公斤，今年每公顷产量增加了九百公斤。曾经向全北越各乡倡议进行竞赛的清化省弘江乡平均每公顷收获干谷四千一百到四千五百公斤。
    越南北方各农业社在晚稻收获中显示了优越性。从初割的情况可以看出，农业生产合作社的晚稻每公顷产量都在三千公斤到五千公斤左右，一般至少也比往年增产10％。谅山省一百一十四个农业生产合作社大部分稻田每公顷产量都在三千公斤左右。其中北山县琼山乡两个农业生产合作社的高地田，往年每公顷只收成一千七百公斤，今年由于肥多水足，平均每公顷收获量达到三千一百公斤，比去年增产82％。
    在红河中游和平原地区，产量也都比往年大大提高。建安省建瑞县明进农业社收割了十三公顷，平均每公顷产量达到四千公斤，其中有三公顷平均每公顷收获近五千公斤。义安省英山县华富农业社位于容易旱的地方，但因今年水利工作做得好，已经收割的部分，单位面积产量都比去年翻一番。太平省舒池县和平农业社全部密植田平均每公顷产量达到了四千三百公斤。
    在收割前，各农业社和变工组都制订了收割工作计划，并且合理地安排了劳动力和充分准备了收割用具和运输工具。各供销社也及时供应了农具。
    南定、清化、富寿等省许多农业社制造了上千辆简易车子，不仅节省了人力，而且提高了收割工作的速度。广平省往年在收割期间都因遭到洪水的侵袭而受到不少的损失，今年这个省准备了上千只木船投入抢运工作。因此，尽管今年遇到了特大洪水，仍然又快又好地完成了收割任务。
    目前，全北方有一万多个农业社正在欢庆丰收声中准备做好建社后第一次晚稻收成的分配工作。
    本报河内19日电　据此间报纸今天报道，在今年晚造生产竞赛中向全北越各乡提出挑战的清化省弘江乡，晚造获得空前大丰收。现全乡晚稻收割工作已经结束，据初步合算，每公顷产量达三点六吨到四吨干谷。
    这个乡今年晚稻取得空前大丰收的原因，是由于全乡农民在党的领导下普遍采用了深耕细作、适当密植、多施肥等先进耕作技术的结果，是由于全乡农民大战干旱、病虫害等自然灾害取得胜利的结果。在今年晚造生产中，除了一些单干户之外，其他全部耕地都采用了密植的耕作方法。其中有十一个农业社还采用了行、株距二十乘十、十五乘十五或十七乘十七的先进密植方法插秧。
    今年晚造全乡所施的厩肥、塘泥、绿肥等各种肥料很多，平均每分地施肥五十四挑。
    这个乡的稻田，在今年晚稻生产开始插秧和稻子接近黄熟时，都曾经遭受到严重的旱灾威胁。在将要开镰收割的时候，又发生病虫害，但在全乡人民的大力抗旱和抢收下，保证了晚稻的大丰收。
    由于今年晚稻的丰收，全乡的三分之二贫农户的收入都比去年晚造增加稻谷一百五十公斤到二百公斤。下中农一般都增加收入或者保持了收成最好的1958年晚稻的数量。这个乡在晚造生产中，由于贯彻了关于晚造全面生产的方针，玉米生产也超过原订计划，饲养业也比以前有所发展，今年，全乡养了三百七十八头牛犊，比去年增加十九头。养鸡两万两千只，比去年增加一千五百只，有些户养鸡达到五、六十只，平均每两户养了三头猪。
    今年弘江乡的晚稻大丰收，进一步显示了农业合作社的优越性，因而这个乡的尚未参加农业社的农民都纷纷要求入社，大大地促进了农业社的巩固和发展。晚造生产刚开始的时候，全乡参加农业社的农户只占农户总数的50％，但是现在全乡基本上完成了初级农业合作化，参加农业社的农户占全乡农户总数的91.64％。
    此外，在今年晚造生产中和弘江乡展开竞赛的越南北方二百四十一个乡，由于采用了先进的耕作技术，因此大部分晚稻的收成比往年好。
