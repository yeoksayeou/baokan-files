Glorious Labor, Lofty Honor
--On the Deeds of Night Soil Collector Shi Chuanxiang

Two Eras

Shi Chuanxiang, a night soil cleaner from Chongwen District, Beijing, was selected to the presidium of the National Congress of Advanced Workers and sat with Party and state leaders and the most outstanding advanced producers in the country to preside over this historically significant meeting. Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Chairman Zhu De, and Premier Zhou Enlai shook hands with him and asked about his work, study, and life. A night soil collector receiving such a lofty honor was not only unheard of in the old society, but even the six thousand advanced producers attending the conference were extremely excited. Glory, labor! The heroes of the conference congratulated him, and Shi Chuanxiang was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth. The medals on his chest reflected the radiance of his dark red face. Looking at the kind faces of the Party and state leaders, he thought to himself, "Without the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, how could I, a night soil collector, be sitting here!"

Residents in Shi Chuanxiang's work area are well aware of his advanced deeds. Carrying a large wooden bucket, he cleans each household's toilet thoroughly and proactively cares about other hygiene issues in the residents' homes; he constantly changes labor organization to increase the number of buckets of night soil carried; not only does he do his own work well, but he also cares about the progress of other cleaners in the team, ensuring that no one lags behind. Since 1954, Shi Chuanxiang has been rated as an advanced worker every year. In 1956, he was elected as a representative of the district people's congress, and this year he became a member of the Beijing Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference and attended the National Congress of Advanced Workers.

Shi Chuanxiang, who is forty-five years old this year, has been a night soil cleaner for thirty years. The new and old societies treat his labor in two completely different ways. In the old society, he pushed a heavy night soil cart from Liubukou to Guang'anmenwai, making four round trips a day, regardless of wind or rain. From dawn until sunset, he cleaned the toilets of the wealthy, and was even cursed by these people as a "dung beetle" and "night owl." In the summer, when he was unbearably thirsty, he reached out to a resident to ask for a bowl of water. A "wealthy lady" covered her nose, busily covering the water tank and hiding the water ladle, and told the old maid to give him a bowl used to feed cats. In such cases, Shi Chuanxiang really wanted to cry when he returned to his room, but at that time, the three yuan monthly salary for collecting night soil was not even guaranteed. "Eating on the road, sleeping on the road, lying on the ground, covered by the sky, with half a brick as a pillow." He wore the same cotton trousers for eight years, but who would sympathize even if he cried himself to death? Shi Chuanxiang spent twenty years in the old society living a life worse than an animal.

In 1949, the country was liberated, and the working people became masters of the country. Under the leadership of the Party, the night soil workers overthrew the night soil despots. The stone weighing on him was lifted. Shi Chuanxiang felt proud and comfortable. In 1952, he transferred to the night soil cleaning team led by the Municipal Health Bureau. He unloaded the handcart that was strapped around his neck and replaced it with an animal-drawn cart. He sat on the cart and yelled at the animals to send the night soil to the countryside. Soon, the animal-drawn cart was replaced by a large truck. Shi Chuanxiang only needed to carry a bucket to collect the night soil from the residents and load it into the truck. His wife wrote from his hometown in Shandong, saying that the whole family had joined the advanced cooperative and that his son and daughter were going to school. During the summer vacation, his son came to see him from his hometown. He was dressed in new clothes from head to toe, and he looked no different from a middle school student in Beijing when he got off the train. Seeing these scenes, Shi Chuanxiang couldn't wait to use all his strength and ran to the captain, saying, "Let me carry a few more buckets of night soil every day!"

The captain asked him how he could carry more. He proposed a method: increase one truck per shift, with three trucks taking turns transporting, reducing the waiting time for night soil carriers. In this way, each person could increase from carrying fifty buckets to seventy buckets. The captain agreed to his idea. The next day, Shi Chuanxiang adjusted the labor force in the team. The working hours were not extended, and two people were saved. Other teams followed their example, and thirteen people were transferred from the entire team to support capital construction.

Awakening

Illness is inevitable for everyone. In the spring of 1955, Shi Chuanxiang had a severe cold. A member of the Party branch accompanied him to Qianmen Hospital for treatment. At that time, there were many people suffering from influenza, and there were more than a hundred patients sitting in the emergency room. Shi Chuanxiang endured the high fever and lay on a chair waiting. The district head of Qianmen District also came to see a doctor. When he saw that Shi Chuanxiang had a fever of forty degrees and was somewhat delirious, he turned to the nurse and said:

"This is a worker from our district, and his condition is dangerous. Please see him first!"

"According to the order, he came late. If we see him first, other patients may have opinions," the nurse said.

The district head immediately explained to the waiting patients. When everyone heard that he was an advanced worker, they all agreed to let him see the doctor first. The district head stayed by Shi Chuanxiang's side, got medicine for him, helped him get an injection, and finally hired a pedicab to send him home. Two days later, Shi Chuanxiang's fever subsided, and he felt relaxed all over. Suddenly, the image of his old colleague Shi Jiaze from more than ten years ago appeared in his mind. Shi Jiaze was a night soil worker like him. Before liberation, he worked for the night soil despots for more than thirty years. When he got old and sick and couldn't get out of bed, the night soil despots viciously drove him out of the house on a rainy night. Shi Jiaze shivered and walked out the door with a torn mat over his head, but he fell under the big locust tree and died after taking only a few steps. Shi Chuanxiang, thinking of the past in light of the present, immediately jumped out of bed and found the Party branch secretary, saying:

"The Party cares for me in every way, and I will do my best to repay the Party! As long as the Party says a word, I will do it even if it means jumping into a fire pit."

The Party branch secretary first helped him sit down on a chair and then said to him, "The Party welcomes you, but what you are thinking is not entirely correct. The Party cares for you and educates you, not to ask you to repay a debt of gratitude, but to hope that you will serve the people better, unite with the people of the whole country, accelerate socialist construction, and make the people of the whole country live a happier life."

"Don't Praise Me"

Shi Chuanxiang felt enlightened after hearing these words. Carrying his night soil bucket, he thought of the residents everywhere. When he walked into No. 34, Dongting'er Hutong, the cesspool in this courtyard was shallow and often overflowed. After Shi Chuanxiang finished collecting the night soil, he moved a stack of bricks and raised the height of the cesspool. A family in Huashi Ertiao had a newly built cesspool, leaving a chamber pot with no place to put it, but another family in Toutiao Hutong had a broken chamber pot, so he automatically brought the chamber pot to this family. After a heavy rain, the wall of a toilet in Huashi Xia Si Tiao collapsed, and many bricks fell into the cesspool. Shi Chuanxiang bent down and picked up the bricks in the cesspool one by one with his hands. After collecting the night soil, he used water to clean the bricks and the ground. When the old man of this family came out and saw this, he was so grateful that he didn't know what to say and kept asking Shi Chuanxiang what his name was.

"Tell me, so I can write a letter to praise you."

"Old man, don't praise me. This is my responsibility." Shi Chuanxiang refused to tell him his name no matter what he said.

In June 1956, Shi Chuanxiang's wish came true, and he was approved to join the Communist Party of China. He felt infinitely honored. As a result, he became even more cheerful. He worked even harder, thinking of ways to carry eighty buckets today and ninety buckets tomorrow. During the Great Leap Forward for Steel Production, he went out to collect night soil during the day and helped with odd jobs for steelmaking in the evening. The Municipal Party Committee called for accumulating fertilizer to support agricultural production in the suburbs. After collecting night soil from the residents' toilets, he took the whole team to collect septic tanks during his rest time. Some of the fertilizer in the septic tanks could not be collected, so Shi Chuanxiang jumped into the tank and shoveled it with a shovel. Under his leadership, the fertilizer they sent to the farmers was the first in the entire team. Sewers were being built in Huashi No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 Hutongs, and all the roads were dug up, and trucks for loading night soil could not enter. Each hutong was more than three li long, and the night soil from every household had to be carried out of the hutong and loaded onto the trucks by people. After discussing with the whole team, Shi Chuanxiang increased the working hours by four hours every day to ensure that the toilets in this area were all sanitary.

Diligent labor has not only been praised by the organization, but also respected by the masses. Many residents invited him into their homes for tea and to wash his hands. One day, an old lady in Huashi Toutiao Hutong handed him a bowl of tea. Shi Chuanxiang remembered that he had just finished collecting night soil and said, "I won't drink it. My hands are dirty and will dirty your bowl!"

The old lady hurriedly said, "Oh, why do you say that? If it weren't for you, our hygiene wouldn't be so good. You serve us, what's it worth to give you a bowl of tea. Don't say that again in the future." From then on, Shi Chuanxiang realized more clearly that no matter what kind of work he did, as long as it was serving the people, it was glorious.

Learn from "Tianqiao"

Once, team member Gong Baozhu suggested: "Now the service industry is learning from the Tianqiao Department Store, let's also learn from it and improve our service attitude!" The seven members of the team had just returned from visiting the Tianqiao Department Store and were discussing ways to improve when team member Zhong Jin had different opinions. He said, "We deal with feces all day long, it's not promising. We just do our job like monks tolling bells, what service attitude do we need to improve? I don't want to do it." Shi Chuanxiang knew that Zhong Jin had this view for more than just a day, and immediately asked everyone to discuss it. Everyone told him many reasons. Shi Chuanxiang said: "Collecting night soil is not promising, what do you want to do? If everyone else does something else, will the city be okay without night soil collectors?" Zhong Jin heard that what everyone said made sense. He had nothing to say, but he was still not convinced in his heart. The Party branch called Shi Chuanxiang and asked him to help Zhong Jin make progress. He knew that Zhong Jin was impatient, so he helped him correct his understanding and took care of him in his life. Soon, Zhong Jin became more active in his work.

After the transformation of those with relatively backward thoughts, the entire team launched a competition to improve service attitude. Early in the morning, before the residents got up, they gently pushed the door open, collected the night soil, and then gently closed the door without disturbing the residents' sleep. Seeing clothes drying in the yard, they first greeted the residents or took the initiative to pull the clothes open to prevent the night soil bucket from rubbing against the clothes. After collecting the night soil, they turned around and looked again. If there was anything spilled on the ground, they immediately swept the ground clean with a broom. Seeing residents eating, they first went to collect the public toilets and waited for the residents to finish eating before going. After the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee was announced, Shi Chuanxiang and the workers of the whole team proposed six conditions to compete with each team: compete for completing more tasks, shorter time, good attitude towards the masses, high attendance rate in the team, no accidents, and saving tools and protective equipment. The thirteen teams in the entire team chased each other, which was very lively. Praising letters from the residents came one after another, and the Chongwen District Night Soil Cleaning Team became the Red Flag Team in Beijing.

    光荣的劳动　崇高的荣誉
    ——记粪便工人时传祥的事迹
    两个时代
    北京市崇文区粪便清洁工人时传祥，被选入全国群英会主席团，同党和国家领导人、全国最杰出的先进生产者坐在一起主持这一有历史意义的大会。刘少奇主席、朱德委员长、周恩来总理和他握手，问他的工作、学习和生活。一个掏粪的工人获得这样崇高的荣誉，不但旧社会里没有见过，就连参加大会的六千先进生产者也感到异常兴奋。光荣呀，劳动！大会的英雄们向他祝贺，时传祥更是喜得合不拢嘴来，胸前的奖章把黑红的脸映得更光辉。他看着党和国家领导人的亲切面容，心里想：“如果没有党和毛主席的领导，我这个掏粪的怎么能坐在这儿呢！”
    时传祥工作地段的居民，都清楚他的先进事迹。他背着大木桶，把一家家的厕所掏得干干净净，并且主动地关心居民家里其他卫生问题；不断地改变劳动组织，提高背粪桶的数量；不但自己工作好，还关心班里其他清洁工的进步，使班里没有落后的人。从1954年起，时传祥年年被评为先进工作者，1956年被选为区人民代表，今年又当了北京市政协委员，出席了全国群英会。
    时传祥，今年四十五岁，已经整整当了三十年的粪便清除工人，新旧社会对待他的劳动完全是截然不同的两种态度。旧社会里，他推着沉重的粪车，由六部口到广安门外，无论刮风下雨一天往返四趟。从晓星出走到太阳落，把有钱人家的厕所掏得干干净净，还被这些人辱骂为“屎克郎”、“夜猫子”。夏天渴得难受，伸手向住户要碗水喝，有一家“阔太太”竟捂着鼻子，忙着盖水缸藏水瓢，叫老妈子拿个喂猫的碗给他。碰到这些情况，时传祥回到屋里真想大哭一场，但是当时掏大粪的一月三块钱工资还拿不到手，“吃马路，睡马路，铺着地，盖着天，脑袋枕着半块砖。”一条棉裤穿了八年，然而哭死了又有谁同情呢？时传祥就这样，在旧社会里整整过了二十年牛马不如的掏粪生活。
    1949年全国解放了，劳动人民成了国家的主人，在党的领导下，粪便工人斗倒了粪霸。压在他身上的石头掀掉了。时传祥扬眉吐气，心情舒畅。1952年他转到市卫生局领导的粪便清除队工作。卸下了套在脖子上的手推车，换了畜力车，坐在车上吆喝两声牲口就把粪送下了乡。不久，畜力车又换上了大汽车，时传祥只要背着个桶从住户那里把粪便掏出来，装进汽车就行了；妻子在山东老家来信说，全家入了高级社，儿子和姑娘上了学。暑假，儿子由家乡来看他，从头到脚一身新，打火车上下来，和北京市里的中学生没差别。看到这些情景，时传祥恨不得立刻把全身的劲都使出来，跑去找队长：“让我每天再多背几桶粪吧！”
    队长问他怎样能多背，他提出一个办法：每班增加一部汽车，由三部汽车轮流运，减少背粪工人等车时间。这样每个人就可以由背五十桶增加到七十桶。队长同意了他的意见，第二天时传祥就在班里调整了劳动力，工作时间没有延长，还节约出两个人。别的班也跟着他们学习，全队抽出了十三个人支援基本建设去了。
    觉醒
    病痛是人人难免的事。1955年春天，时传祥得了重感冒，党支部委员陪着他到前门医院就诊。那时患流行性感冒的人比较多，急诊室里坐着一百多个病人，时传祥忍着高烧躺在椅上等。前门区的区长也来看病，他一看时传祥烧到四十度，神志也有些昏迷，转身就对护士说：
    “这是我们区的工人，病势危险，快给他先看吧！”
    “按次序他来得晚，给他先看了其他病人可能有意见。”护士说。
    区长立即向在坐的候诊病人解释，大家听说他是个先进工人，也都同意让他先看。区长守在时传祥的身边，给他拿药，扶他打针，最后雇了三轮车送他回家。两天后，时传祥退了烧，全身轻松。忽然十多年前的老同事施加泽的面影在他脑中出现了。施加泽是和他一样的掏粪工人，解放前给粪霸干了三十多年活，老了病得不能起床，粪霸恶毒地在一个下雨天的晚上，把他撵出了屋，施加泽抖抖索索地顶了个破席子，走出门没几步就倒在大槐树下死去了。时传祥由今思昔，立刻跳下床去找到了党支部书记说：
    “党处处关怀我，我也要拿出全力来报答党！只要党说句话，就是跳火炕我都干。”
    党支部书记先扶他在椅上坐下，然后对他说：“党欢迎你，可你想的不全对。党关怀你教育你，不是为了要你报恩，是希望你更好地为人民服务，和全国人民团结一条心，加快社会主义建设，让全国人民都生活得更幸福。”
    “不要表扬我”
    时传祥听了这席话，心里明亮了。他背着粪桶处处为住户着想，走进东厅儿胡同三十四号，这个院里的毛坑浅，常常漫出来。时传祥掏完粪后就搬来一迭砖，把这家毛坑加高了。花市二条一家新砌了毛坑，留下个马桶没地方放，可是头条胡同里另有一户人家的马桶却坏了，他就自动地把马桶捎给这一家。大雨后，花市下四条有一家厕所的墙塌了，许多砖块倒在粪坑里，时传祥弯下腰用手把毛坑里的砖头一块块地拣出来，掏完了粪又用水把砖和地面冲刷的干干净净。这家的老大爷出来一看，感激得不知说什么好，直问时传祥叫什么名字；
    “你告诉我吧，好让我写信表扬表扬你。”
    “老大爷你不要表扬我了，这是我的责任。”时传祥任他怎样说也不把名字告诉他。
    1956年6月，时传祥的愿望实现了，他被批准加入了中国共产党。他感到无上的光荣。这一来，他变得更加乐呵呵了。工作的干劲也更足了，今天想办法背八十桶，明天又想办法背九十桶。大炼钢铁的时候，白天出去掏粪，晚上回来又帮助炼钢的打杂。市委号召积肥支援郊区农业生产。他掏完住户的厕所，休息时间又带着全班人去掏化粪池。有些化粪池的粪肥掏不上来，时传祥就跳进池里去用铲子铲，在他的带头下，他们班送给农民的粪肥在全队数第一。花市一、二、三条胡同都修下水道，路全挖了，装粪的汽车进不去。每条胡同都有三里多路长，家家的粪便全得靠人背出胡同装车。时传祥和全班一讨论，每天增加四小时保证了这个地段的厕所个个卫生。
    勤勤恳恳的劳动不但受到组织上的表扬，也受到群众的尊敬。许多居民请他进屋喝茶、洗手。一天，花市头条胡老太太递给他一碗茶。时传祥想起自己刚掏完粪，忙说：“不喝了，我的手脏，把你的碗也给弄脏了！”
    老大娘急忙说：“啊哟你怎么说这话，不是你们来，我们的卫生那能搞得这样好。你为我们服务，我给你倒碗茶算啥。以后再别这么说啦。”从此，时传祥更清楚地感到无论做什么工作，只要是为人民服务就是光荣的。
    学“天桥”
    一次，组员巩宝珠提议：“现在服务行业都在学天桥商场，我们也去学学，改进服务态度吧！”全班七个人从天桥商场参观回来正在商量改进办法，组员钟晋有了不同的意见。他说：“整天和大粪打交道，没出息，做天和尚撞天钟得了，还要改善什么服务态度，我不干。”时传祥知道钟晋有这个看法不是一天了，立即要大家讨论。大家给他讲了好多道理，时传祥说：“掏大粪的没有出息你要干什么呢，如果大家都干别的，城市里没掏粪的能行吗”？钟晋听大家说的有道理，嘴里没话说，心里还不服。党支部把时传祥找去要他帮助钟晋进步。他知道钟晋的性子躁，一方面帮助他改正认识，一方面在生活上照顾他。不久，钟晋工作积极起来了。
    思想比较落后的人转变过来以后，全班展开了改进服务态度的竞赛。清晨住户还没有起床，他们轻轻地推开门，掏完粪再轻轻地把门带上，不惊动住户的睡眠。看到院里晾着衣服，先给住户打个招呼，或者自己主动地把衣服拉开，免得粪桶蹭到衣服上。掏完粪，回过身来再看看，有洒在地上的，立即用扫帚把地面扫干净。看到住户在吃饭，就先去掏公共厕所，等住户吃完饭再去。党的八中全会决议公布以后，时传祥又和全班工人提出六项条件向各班竞赛：赛完成任务多，时间短，对群众态度好，班里出勤率高，不出事故，节约工具和防护用品。全队十三个班，你追我赶，热闹极了，居民们的表扬信纷纷传来，崇文区粪便清除队成了北京的红旗队。
