Hatching Poultry Not Restricted by Season
Wang Deyuan

Based on years of practical experience, hatching work is not restricted by the season. Of course, spring is a great time for hatching production, as poultry lay more eggs, have a higher fertilization rate, and a higher hatching rate at this time. However, in autumn and winter, we can artificially create conditions to meet the requirements of hatching, and also improve poultry hatching production to a certain level.

What should be paid attention to in autumn and winter hatching production?

In terms of seed eggs, first, for new seed eggs produced in autumn and winter, pick them frequently every day. After each picking, pay attention to keeping them warm, preferably in a room with a temperature of 15 to 20 degrees Celsius; second, the storage date of seed eggs in winter should be no more than ten days; third, when the outdoor temperature is below zero, pay attention to keeping the seed eggs warm to prevent them from freezing.

In terms of hatching, first, if the temperature of the hatching room is below 21 degrees Celsius, a stove should be installed to maintain a normal room temperature; second, with the change of seasons, there should be new requirements for various operations in hatching production. For example, when doing egg inspection, setting eggs, picking chicks, and cleaning, fastidiousness and meticulousness are required, and each task should preferably not exceed 30 minutes; third, in late autumn or midwinter, the air exchange method in the incubator is still the same as in spring and summer, that is, the air and temperature of the hatching room should be adjusted to make the staff feel comfortable; fourth, in autumn and winter, the cooling time for eggs is generally shorter than in late spring and summer. The cooling time for eggs in autumn is about 15 to 20 minutes, and in winter it is 5 to 10 minutes. Under normal circumstances, cool them twice a day, once every 12 hours; fifth, the temperature and humidity are the same as in other seasons, and there is no need to change them.

Whether it is chicks or ducklings, years of work experience have proven that they are not suitable for storage at high temperatures (especially ducklings), but too low a temperature is also not appropriate. When young chicks are transported out of the hatchery in winter, heat preservation equipment should be added, such as covering them with quilts, blankets, etc.

    孵家禽不受季节限制
    王德元
    根据历年的工作实践证明，孵化工作是不受季节限制的。当然，春季是孵化生产的大好时光，家禽在此时产卵多、受精率高、出雏率高。但是，秋冬两季我们可以适应孵化的要求人为地创造条件，也能使家禽孵化生产提高到一定的水平。
    秋冬孵化生产应该注意哪些事项呢？
    在种卵方面，一、对秋冬季新产种卵，每天要勤拣，每次拣出后要注意保温，最好放在摄氏十五度至二十度的房间内；二、冬季种卵储存的日期以十天为宜；三、室外温度低于零下时，应注意种卵的保温，不使冻坏。
    在孵化方面，一、孵化室的温度若低于摄氏二十一度以下，应安装火炉，以保持室温的正常；二、随着季节的变化，对孵化生产的各项操作也要有新的要求。比如在做检卵、落盘、拣雏、清扫等工作的时候，要求快速细致，每项工作最好不超过三十分钟；三、在深秋或隆冬，孵化机内的换气方法仍如春夏一样，即将孵化室的空气、温度调节到使工作人员感觉舒适为合适；四、秋冬季节凉卵工作在时间上一般要比晚春和夏季缩短。秋季凉卵时间大约在十五到二十分钟，冬季五到十分钟，正常情况下一天凉两次，每十二小时凉一次；五、温度、湿度和其他季节一样，不用变更。
    无论是鸡雏或鸭雏，多年来的工作经验证明，都不适合在高温下存放（尤其是鸭雏），但温度过低也不相宜。在冬季小雏运出孵化室时，应加盖保温设备，如蒙盖棉被、毛毯等。
