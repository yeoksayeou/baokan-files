    Right-leaning opportunists and comrades with serious right-leaning ideological errors, in order to attack the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee, fabricated all kinds of so-called "contradictions"; in essence, this is the contradiction between their bourgeois individualism ambition and the Party's struggle for leadership. Let us uncover the essence of the so-called "contradictions" one by one.
    First, they say: there is a contradiction between the leadership of the Party committee and the responsibility of the factory director, "the Party committee manages too broadly, the secretary grasps everything, and the factory director has nothing to do," "hurting the enthusiasm of administrative cadres." In fact, this is not the case at all. The Communist Party is the vanguard of the proletariat and the highest form of organization of the class. The Party leads everything, and all work should be placed under the absolute leadership of the Party. Our Party organization in enterprises is not managing too broadly, but in some aspects, its management is not enough. Does strengthening the Party's leadership mean that "the factory director has nothing to do"? Not at all. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the factory director bears the responsibility of uniformly directing the enterprise's production and administrative work. When the Party committee makes decisions, the factory director should actively and proactively propose plans for the Party committee to discuss, especially regarding production work. As for actual work, there is only work that cannot be finished, not nothing to do. How can it be said that administrative cadres cannot exert their enthusiasm? Obviously, what they mean by "cannot be responsible," "nothing to do," and "cannot exert enthusiasm" refers to not being able to be "commander," not having the responsibility of "commander," not having the work of "commander," thus hurting their enthusiasm to surpass the Party committee, hurting their enthusiasm to form their own system and not listen to the Party committee's call.
    Second, they say: the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee contradicts unified command, one-sidedly emphasizing the characteristics of modern enterprises with complex technology and detailed division of labor, emphasizing that production must be centralized and unified. They say things like "too many Party committee leaders lead to a lack of unified command, messing up the enterprise. Only individual unified command can run the enterprise well." The problem is already very clear, they are using the characteristics of modern enterprises as an excuse to implement personal dictatorial behavior, which fundamentally negates the principle of the Party's democratic centralism. We admit that modern enterprises have continuous operation, complex technology, and need to be centralized and unified; however, when analyzing the characteristics of enterprises, we must first clearly recognize that our enterprises are socialist enterprises, not capitalist enterprises. In enterprise management, we must never follow the methods of the bourgeoisie, we must use socialist management methods. Under this premise, the concentration we require is concentration on the basis of high democracy. Only with high democracy can there be high concentration. This is one aspect. On the other hand, the centralized leadership in an enterprise should be concentrated in the Party committee, not in the factory director individually (of course, this is not to say that the factory director's unified command is not needed in the enterprise's production). The members of the Party committee are composed of responsible cadres from administrative, trade union, Communist Youth League, and other aspects. Only after collective discussion by the Party committee can we unify our thinking, unify our understanding, and unify our actions, and only then can we ensure correct unified command. Obviously, the unified command they require is a self-centered unified command, a unified command that places the individual above the leadership of the Party committee.
    Third, they say: the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee contradicts the responsibility system, saying things like "collective leadership means everyone is responsible, and no one is responsible." This is completely a distortion. The central government's stipulated enterprise leadership system is: "Within the Party, it is a division of labor responsibility system under collective leadership; outside the Party, it is a factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee." As far as the administrative management of a factory is concerned, it has been clearly stipulated that the factory director should bear full responsibility for administrative work under the leadership of the Party committee; under the factory director, there are also vice-factory directors in charge of production, technology, and supply. Isn't this a clear responsibility system? In fact, there are also two types of responsibility systems: one is simply relying on organizational regulations; the other is relying on organizational regulations and strengthening political work. Only the latter can establish a strict responsibility system with ideological consciousness and a political soul.
    Fourth, they say: the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee contradicts timely command, "many problems have to be discussed and discussed, affecting the timely resolution of problems." This is also obviously inconsistent with the facts. The problems that the Party committee needs to discuss are the enterprise's principles, policies, cadre allocation, a period of plans, work arrangements, and major issues that the Party committee believes must be discussed, and will never and cannot take over everything related to administrative affairs. As for making problems resolved in a timely manner, the first requirement is that the problem is resolved correctly, in line with the requirements of the masses, which must be done through collective discussion. For urgent problems that need to be decided and handled quickly, not only the factory director has the right to handle them, but also the workshop director, the work section director, and even a worker, all have the right and responsibility to handle them. The Party committee not only does not restrict this, but actively supports it.
    In short, the various fallacies of right-leaning opportunists and comrades with serious right-leaning ideological errors are fundamentally untenable and can only further expose their anti-Party nature. Their so-called "normal production" is passive and balanced normal production; their so-called "unified command" is forced command, without a political soul, and without ideological consciousness; their so-called "clear responsibility" is a simple organizational responsibility without ideological awareness; their so-called "timely command" is a personal dictatorial timely command. All of this is of course not needed by our socialist enterprises and must be resolutely opposed.
    In order to achieve their goal of opposing the Party's absolute leadership over enterprises, right-leaning opportunists and comrades with serious right-leaning ideological errors also put forward a set of revisionist propositions. One is dualism. They say: "The secretary presides over the standing committee, and the secretary is the core of deciding problems; the factory director is the core of implementing them," "The secretary is in command, the factory director gives orders, and the 'commander' and 'order' are separated." This obviously reduces the Party's leadership to the role of a bourgeois parliament, thereby abolishing the Party's leadership and implementing their dictatorial behavior. The second is the theory of separation of party and government powers. They want to divide powers and responsibilities with the Party committee, which is essentially drawing circles to restrict the Party committee, so that they can form their own situation. The third is production first, and the factory director is supreme. They say: "The factory focuses on production, the factory director is in charge of production, and the Party committee should cooperate, guarantee, and supervise." This nakedly reduces the Party to a subordinate position, becoming a tool for the factory director's personal dictatorial behavior. The fourth is that the deputy factory director is responsible to the factory director, and the factory director is then responsible to the Party committee. We believe that outside the Party, in administrative management work, the deputy factory director should of course be responsible to the factory director; however, within the Party, every Party committee member (including the Party member deputy factory director) should be directly responsible to the Party committee. The essence of their raising this issue is to try to sever the direct connection between the deputy factory director and the Party committee, making it easier to form their own system and confront the Party committee. The fifth is that the factory director has the right of veto. They say: "When the Party committee has a conflict with the ministry or bureau, the factory director has the right of veto." This statement itself is self-contradictory. Since the factory director is executing the instructions of the ministry or bureau when there is a disagreement, what is the factory director's right of veto for? The essence of this is that the factory director can veto the Party committee's resolutions, blatantly placing the factory director above the Party committee.

### 坚持党对企业的绝对领导

    坚持党对企业的绝对领导
    右倾机会主义分子和有严重右倾思想错误的同志，为了攻击党委领导下的厂长负责制，臆造了各种各样的所谓“矛盾”；这实质上是他们的资产阶级个人主义野心向党争夺领导权的矛盾。让我们逐条揭开所谓“矛盾”的本质。
    第一，他们说：党委领导与厂长负责有矛盾，“党委管的宽，书记统一抓，厂长没事干了”，“伤害了行政干部的积极性”。事实上完全不是这样。共产党是无产阶级的先锋队，是阶级的最高组织形式，党是领导一切的，一切工作都应该置于党的绝对领导之下。我们企业党的组织，不是管的太宽了，而是在某些方面管的还不够。加强党的领导，是不是“厂长就没事干了”呢？完全不是的。在党委的领导下，厂长肩负着统一指挥企业生产行政工作的责任，党委作决定时，全厂的行政工作，尤其是生产方面的工作，厂长应该积极主动地提出方案供党委讨论。至于实际工作，只有干不完，不会没事做。怎么能够说行政干部不能发挥积极性呢？很显然，他们所说的“不能负责”、“没事干”、“不能发挥积极性”，就是指的不能当“帅”了，没有“帅”的责任了，没有“帅”的事干了，因而伤害了他们企图超越党委之上的积极性，伤害了他们自成系统、不听党委召唤的积极性。
    第二，他们说：党委领导下的厂长负责制与统一指挥有矛盾，片面强调现代化企业技术复杂、分工细致的特点，强调生产要集中统一。说什么“党委领导头多了，缺乏统一指挥，把企业搞乱了，只有个人统一指挥才能把企业办好。”问题已经十分清楚，他们是借口现代化企业的特点，实行个人独断专行，这就从根本上否定了党的民主集中制的原则。我们承认，现代化企业连续作业，技术复杂，要有集中统一；但是，在分析企业特点的时候，首先要明确认识我们的企业是社会主义企业，不是资本主义企业。在企业管理上，决不能沿用资产阶级的方法，一定要用社会主义的管理方法。在这个前提下，我们所要求的集中，是在高度民主基础上的集中。只有高度的民主，才能有高度的集中。这是一方面。另一方面，一个企业里的集中领导，应当集中到党委，不应当集中到厂长个人（当然不是说在企业的生产中不需要厂长的统一指挥）。党委的成员是由行政、工会、共青团等方面的党员负责干部组成的，只有经过党委的集体讨论，才能够统一思想，统一认识，统一行动，也才能保证正确的统一指挥。显然，他们所要求的统一指挥，是唯我的统一指挥，把个人置于党委领导之上的统一指挥。
    第三，他们说：党委领导下的厂长负责制与责任制有矛盾，说什么“集体领导是大家负责，大家都不负责”。这完全是一种歪曲。中央规定的企业领导体制是：“在党内是集体领导下的分工负责制，在党外是党委领导下的厂长负责制。”就一个工厂的行政管理来说，已明确规定：厂长在党委的领导下，在行政工作上应负全责；在厂长之下，又有管生产的、管技术的、管供应的副厂长的分工。这不是明确的责任制吗？其实，责任制也有两种：一种是单纯依靠组织规定；一种是依靠组织规定，加强政治工作。只有后者，才能建立起有思想自觉、有政治灵魂的、严格的责任制度。
    第四，他们说：党委领导下的厂长负责制与指挥及时有矛盾，“很多问题都要讨论讨论，影响问题的及时解决”。这显然也是不符合事实的。党委要讨论的问题，是企业的方针、政策、干部配备，一个时期的计划、工作部署，以及党委认为必须讨论的重大问题，绝不会也不可能包揽行政事务的一切。至于要使问题得到及时解决，首先要求问题解决得正确，符合群众要求，这就必须经过集体讨论。对于紧急的问题，需要当机立断、迅速处理的，不仅厂长有处理权，车间主任、工部主任乃至一个工人，都有处理的权利和责任，党委不仅不限制，而且是积极支持的。
    总之，右倾机会主义分子和有严重右倾思想错误的同志的种种谬论，根本站不住脚，只能更加暴露他们的反党本质。他们的所谓“生产正常”，是消极平衡的生产正常；所谓“指挥统一”，是强迫命令、没有政治灵魂、没有思想自觉的统一；所谓“责任明确”，是没有思想觉悟、单纯的组织上的责任明确；所谓“指挥及时”，是个人独断专行的指挥及时。这一切，当然是我们社会主义企业所不需要的，是要坚决反对的。
    右倾机会主义分子和有严重右倾思想错误的同志，为了达到他们反对党对企业绝对领导的目的，还提出了一套修正主义的主张。一是二元论。他们说：“开常委会书记主持，决定问题以书记为核心；贯彻执行要以厂长为核心”，“书记挂帅，厂长行令，‘帅’‘令’分家”。这是明显地把党的领导降低为资产阶级议会式的作用，从而取消党的领导，实行他们的独断专行。二是党政分权论。他们要与党委划分权限，划分责任，这实质上是给党委画圈套，束缚党委的手脚，以便他们自成局面。三是生产第一，厂长至高论。他们说：“工厂以生产为主，厂长主管生产，党委应当配合、保证、监督。”这就赤裸裸地把党降低到附属地位，变成厂长个人独断专行的工具。四是副厂长对厂长负责，厂长再向党委负责。我们认为，在党外，在行政管理工作上，副厂长当然应当对厂长负责；但是，在党内，每一个党委委员（包括党员副厂长）都应该对党委直接负责。他们提出这个问题的实质，是企图割断副厂长和党委的直接联系，便于自成系统，与党委分庭抗礼。五是厂长有否决权。他们说：“党委与部、局发生矛盾时，厂长有否决权。”这种说法本身就自相矛盾，既然意见不一致时，执行部、局指示，厂长还要什么否决权呢？这实质上是厂长可以否决党委的决议，明目张胆地把厂长置于党委之上了。（摘自“河南日报”10月22日社论）
