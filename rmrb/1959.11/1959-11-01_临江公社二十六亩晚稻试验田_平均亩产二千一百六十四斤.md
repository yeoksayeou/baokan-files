    Linjiang Commune's Twenty-six Mu Late Rice Experimental Field
    Average Yield Reaches 2,164 Jin Per Mu

    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 30th: Two single-season late rice experimental fields in Jincheng Brigade of Linjiang Commune, Pucheng County, Fujian Province, have achieved extraordinarily high yields. These two experimental fields, totaling twenty-six and a half mu, yielded an average of 2,164 jin of rice per mu, an increase of 73.2% compared to the combined yield of early and late rice crops on these same fields last year.

    In these high-yield experimental fields, the rice plants generally reached a height of six chi and two cun, with thick and sturdy stalks, and panicles about one chi and one cun long, densely packed with full grains. Before the harvest, they attracted the attention of many passersby. During the harvest, the Deputy Secretary of the Communist Youth League Pucheng County Committee, the Brigade Party Branch Secretary, and three cadres from the Commune Agricultural Science Institute participated in the harvesting, weighing, and land measurement from beginning to end.

    These two experimental fields originally had shallow, barren soil and very low yields. However, due to the soaring enthusiasm of the commune members, the per-mu yield exceeded one thousand jin during the Great Leap Forward last year. This year, they continued to hold high the red flag of the General Line, formulated a plan to create double-thousand-jin high-yield experimental fields, and set a banner for high yield in mountainous areas. They paid great attention to detail in field management, carrying out five rounds of inter-tillage combined with topdressing, ensuring shallow water and frequent irrigation. They adopted a combination of prevention as the main approach, and early, minimal, and thorough treatment for pests and diseases. During inter-tillage, they applied a total of ten jin of tea cake per mu in two applications to prevent the occurrence of rice stem borers, rice gall midges, and rice leafhoppers; small locusts were also promptly eradicated as soon as they appeared.

    临江公社二十六亩晚稻试验田
    平均亩产二千一百六十四斤
    据新华社福州30日电　福建浦城县临江公社锦城大队有两片单季晚稻试验田特大丰收。这两片试验田共二十六亩六分半，平均每亩收稻谷二千一百六十四斤，比去年这两片田早、晚稻两季亩产量还提高73.2％。
    这两片丰产试验田，一般稻子高达六尺二，稻秆粗壮，穗长一尺一左右，粒密饱满。收割前，吸引着多少行人过客的注意。收获时，共青团浦城县委副书记、大队支部书记和公社农业科学研究所三个干部，自始至终参加收割、过秤和丈量土地。
    这两片试验田，原来土层浅薄贫瘠，产量很低，但是由于社员干劲冲天，在去年大跃进中亩产量曾超过千斤。今年，他们继续高举总路线红旗，订出创造双千斤丰产试验田的规划，为山区高产树立旗帜。在田间管理上，作得十分精细，他们先后中耕结合追肥共五次，作到浅水勤润。对病虫害采取以防为主和治早、治少、治了等防治兼施的办法，在中耕时先后两次每亩共施茶饼十斤，防止了稻包虫、枯心虫、稻飞蚤的发生；小蝗虫一露头也及时扑灭。（附图片）
