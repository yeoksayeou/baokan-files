Wanzai County Launches Nine Red Banner Competition
Mutual Progress in Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, Sideline Occupations, and Fishery

    (Our report) Wanzai County, Jiangxi Province, has launched a Nine Red Banner Competition movement, organizing the broad masses into the movement of increasing production and practicing economy, thus guaranteeing an all-round leap forward in various productions.

    Wanzai County's Nine Red Banner Competition, centered on rice and encompassing rice, cotton, oil crops, hogs, draft cattle, fishery, forestry, sideline occupations, and ramie, ensures that one industry drives another, and all industries promote each other, achieving comprehensive and balanced development in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. In rice production, by prioritizing the labor force needed for transplanting, harvesting, and combating drought and pests, the total output and per-mu yield of early rice and single-season late rice increased by 20% to 40% compared to last year. The bumper harvest of rice provided over ten million jin of grain feed for the development of draft cattle, hogs, and poultry throughout the county, thus correspondingly promoting the development of animal husbandry. Through the hog raising Red Banner Competition, the number of hogs in the county increased from over forty thousand last year to one hundred and ten thousand. Including draft cattle, each mu of the county's more than 300,000 mu of late rice fields received an additional ten dan of pig and cattle manure, which is another important factor in promoting increased grain production.

    In various locations, the Nine Red Banner Competition takes the specific forms of "Protect the Banner, Seize the Banner, Send the Banner, Welcome the Banner," and uses organization, assessment, inspection, and visits to ensure the sustained development of the movement, making the production increase movement surge higher and higher. During the Nine Red Banner Competition, the county closely grasped the main production seasons for inspection and assessment. Zhutan Commune, originally the Red Banner winner for late rice field management, while Baishui Commune, with its high mountains and cold water, had historically lower late rice yields than the plains. This time, they learned from Zhutan Commune's leadership methods of focusing on both advanced teams and backward teams, both near fields and far fields. Coupled with the promotion of on-site grass cutting, on-site composting, and water diversion to the mountains, they ensured that the seedlings in remote fields could "eat and drink their fill," rapidly transforming third-class seedlings into first-class seedlings. As a result, Baishui Commune seized the rice Red Banner. After Zhutan Commune sent away the Red Banner, the broad masses of commune members were full of enthusiasm and demanded to regain the Red Banner. The commune Party committee immediately mobilized all commune members to launch a pest control and drought resistance campaign, strengthening late rice field management and resolutely taking back the Red Banner. After winning the Red Banner, Baishui Commune also launched a movement to protect the Red Banner throughout the commune, using measures such as re-fertilization and re-weeding to further advance the late rice exceeding early rice production competition.

    The Nine Red Banner Competition in Wanzai County has achieved significant economic results. The county timely eliminated the insect and drought disasters affecting 200,000 mu of late rice, making a bumper harvest in sight for more than half of the fields that were about to suffer reduced yields, and reducing the yield reduction to only 10% for the 20,000 mu that were about to suffer crop failure. The more than 60,000 mu of single-season late rice that have already been harvested averaged over 500 jin per mu, an increase of 42% compared to early rice, achieving the requirement of late rice exceeding early rice. Although more than 3,800 mu of cotton were being tried for the first time with limited experience, due to the in-depth development of the competition movement, exceeding 100 jin per mu has become a certainty. Oil crops have also had a bumper harvest this year, with the harvested early sesame increasing by 29% compared to last year. The yield of more than 4,000 mu of peanuts doubled on the basis of 250 jin last year, and the yield of more than 5,000 mu of soybeans intercropped on the ridges of rice fields also increased by one times compared to last year. As of now, hog production has completed 73% of the breeding and sales plan, an increase of 30% compared to the same period last year. Due to fish farming in ponds, reservoirs, and rice fields, the area of fish farming in mountainous areas has expanded by 53% compared to last year, and the number of fish has increased tenfold compared to last year. Draft cattle have increased to 20,000 heads throughout the county, an increase of 15% compared to last year, due to the advanced breeding methods summarized and promoted from the competition. Forestry has fully launched a competition with the goals of "large afforestation area, good afforestation work, and achievements in forest protection." It has now completed the cultivation of more than 4,000 mu of economic forests such as oil tea and tung trees, with a survival rate of 85%. At the same time, it has also supported national construction with more than 380,000 bamboo poles and more than 200,000 cubic meters of timber. Ramie has achieved an average yield increase of 34% per mu compared to last year on more than 1,000 mu of ramie throughout the county through the four conditions competition of "maintaining old plants well, cultivating new plants well, completing the expansion plan well, and increasing output quickly," ensuring the supply of raw materials for the production of the famous "Wanzai summer cloth." Sideline production has fully utilized mountainous resources through the competition of "broadening production avenues and exceeding 100 yuan in income per person." The well-known Wanzai summer cloth, fireworks, and watch paper have been sold to Southeast Asia and other places, and each household has an average of twelve poultry. Now, the county's plan for each commune member to exceed 100 yuan in income from sideline production is nearing completion.

    万载县开展九面红旗竞赛
    农林牧副渔五业互相促进
    本报讯　江西万载县开展九面红旗竞赛运动，把广大群众都组织到增产节约运动中来，保证了各项生产全面跃进。
    万载县以水稻为中心的水稻、棉花、油料、毛猪、耕牛、渔业、林业、副业和苎麻的九面红旗竞赛，保证了一业带一业，业业相促进，农林牧副渔五业综合平衡发展。在水稻生产方面，由于优先满足了插秧、收割以及抗旱、灭虫斗争中所需要的劳动力，因而早稻和一季晚稻总产量和亩产量分别比去年增长了20％至40％。水稻的丰产丰收，为全县发展耕牛、毛猪、家禽提供了一千多万斤粮食饲料，因而相应地推动了畜牧业的发展。通过养猪红旗竞赛，全县的毛猪由去年的四万多头增长到十一万头，连同耕牛在内，全县三十多万亩晚稻每亩增加了十担猪牛粪，这是促进粮食增产的又一个重要因素。
    各地开展九面红旗竞赛，都以“保旗、夺旗、送旗、迎旗”为竞赛的具体形式，以组织评比、检查、参观来保证运动的持久发展，使增产运动一浪高过一浪。在九面红旗竞赛中，全县紧紧抓住主要生产季节进行检查评比。株潭公社原是晚稻田间管理红旗获得者，山高水冷的白水公社，历来晚稻产量低于平原，这次学到了株潭公社既抓先进队更抓落后队、既抓近田更抓远田的领导方法，再加上推广就地割草、就地沤肥和引水上山等办法，保证了边远田禾苗能够“吃饱喝足”，使三类苗迅速上升为一类苗，结果白水公社夺得了水稻红旗。株潭公社送走了红旗，广大社员干劲十足，纷纷要求再夺回红旗。公社党委立即发动全体社员开展灭虫、抗旱斗争，加强晚稻田间管理，坚决拿回红旗。而白水公社在夺得红旗以后，也在全社掀起了保住红旗运动，以再追肥、再耘苗等措施，把晚稻超早稻的增产竞赛又向前推进了一步。
    万载县开展九面红旗竞赛，在经济上取得了显著的效果。全县及时消除了二十万亩晚稻的虫、旱灾害，使半数以上要减产的田丰收在望，二万亩要失收的只减产10％。已经收割的六万多亩一季晚稻，每亩平均达到五百斤以上，比早稻增产42％，实现了晚稻超早稻的要求。三千八百多亩棉花虽是首次试种，经验不多，但由于竞赛运动深入的开展，每亩超百斤已成定局。油料作物今年也是大丰收，已收的早芝麻比去年增产了29％，四千多亩花生在去年二百五十斤的基础上增产了一倍，间作在稻田田埂上的五千多亩黄豆产量也比去年提高一倍。生猪生产到目前止已完成饲养、交售计划的73％，比去年同期增长30％。山区渔业生产，由于做到了水塘、水库、稻田都养鱼，养鱼面积比去年扩大了53％，养鱼数量比去年增加十倍。耕牛由于从竞赛中总结并推广了先进的繁殖方法，全县耕牛发展到二万头，比去年增加了15％。林业由于全面掀起以“造林面积大，育林工作好，护林有成绩”的竞赛，现已完成四千多亩油茶、油桐等经济林的栽培，成活率达到了85％；同时还以三十八万多根竹子、二十万多立方米木材支援了国家建设。苎麻通过“老兜维护好，新兜培育好，扩种计划完成好，产量提高快”的四项条件竞赛，使全县一千多亩苎麻每亩平均产量比去年增长34％，保证了著名的“万载夏布”生产的原料供应。副业生产通过“广开生产门路，每人收入超百元”的竞赛，使山区资源得到了充分利用。驰名远近的万载夏布、花炮、表芯纸已远销南洋等地，家禽每户平均达到了十二只。现在，全县各公社副业生产收入每人超百元的计划已接近完成。
