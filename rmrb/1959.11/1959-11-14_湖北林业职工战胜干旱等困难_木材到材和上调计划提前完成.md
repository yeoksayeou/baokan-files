Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 13th: Forestry workers in Hubei Province have exceeded their annual timber delivery (i.e., transporting timber to storage yards) and transfer plans ahead of schedule. By the end of October, the province had delivered over 890,000 cubic meters of timber, exceeding the annual task by 12.2%, an increase of 14.6% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. More than 467,000 cubic meters of timber were transferred, exceeding the annual task by 1.5%, an increase of over 40% compared to 1958.

The ability of Hubei Province to complete its annual timber delivery and transfer plans ahead of schedule is mainly due to the implementation of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and the vigorous mass movement. Since the beginning of the year, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee has listed timber production along with steel, iron, and coal as key points of the province's industrial production. The secretaries of the prefectural, county, and people's commune party committees in key forest areas have also personally taken charge, leading timber production and transportation work. Various localities have arranged timber production based on the principle of "catching up in front and not falling behind." Because they started early and seized the season, they were proactive step by step, laying the foundation for completing the annual plan ahead of schedule.

After entering the summer, Hubei Province experienced its worst drought in seventy years. According to incomplete statistics, out of 241 streams in the province capable of transporting timber, 212 had dried up due to the prolonged drought and lack of rain. Eighty percent of Hubei's timber relies on water transport. At this time, some cadres developed right-leaning feelings of fear and difficulty, resulting in a significant reduction in the labor force transporting timber in July, and production declined for a time. Just then, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued a call to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and practice increasing production and practicing economy. The workers criticized the right-leaning ideas of fearing difficulties and relying on the heavens for rain among a few cadres, and strengthened their confidence in the idea that "man can conquer nature." When the water was low, they built dams in sections, blocking small streams to create large bodies of water. When there was no water, they built plank roads, wooden railways, bamboo and wooden chutes, etc., changing water transport to land transport. After such a tenacious struggle, they finally overcame various difficulties, causing the amount of timber delivered and transferred to increase steadily.

    湖北林业职工战胜干旱等困难
    木材到材和上调计划提前完成
    新华社武汉13日电　湖北省林业职工已提前超额完成了全年木材到材（即把木材运到贮木场）和上调计划。到10月底止，全省已到材八十九万多立方米，超过全年任务的12.2％，比大跃进的1958年增加14.6％；上调木材四十六万七千多立方米，超过全年任务的1.5％，比1958年增加40％以上。
    湖北省能够提前完成全年木材到材和上调计划，主要是由于贯彻了党的社会主义建设总路线和大搞群众运动。年初以来，中共湖北省委便把木材生产和钢、铁、煤一起列为全省工业生产重点。各重点林区的地委、县委、人民公社党委的书记也都亲自挂帅，领导木材生产和运输工作。各地本着赶前不拉后的原则安排了木材生产。由于抓得早、抢住了季节，步步主动，为提前完成全年计划打下了基础。
    入夏以后，湖北省出现了七十年来未有的大旱。据不完全统计，全省二百四十一条能运送木材的溪流，因久旱无雨而干涸了二百一十二条。湖北木材80％要依靠水运。这时，有的干部便产生了右倾畏难情绪，以致7月份运输木材的劳动力大为减少，生产一度下降。正在这时，党的八届八中全会发出了反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的号召，职工们批判了畏难情绪和少数干部中靠天下雨的右倾思想，坚定了人定胜天的信心，水小，他们就分段筑坝，把小水堵成大水；无水，就修板车道、木轨道、竹木滑道等，改水运为陆运。经过这样顽强地斗争后，终于战胜了各种困难，使木材到材、上调任务的数量节节上升。
