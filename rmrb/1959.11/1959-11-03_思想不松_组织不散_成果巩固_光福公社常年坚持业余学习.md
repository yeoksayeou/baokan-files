    Ideology Not Relaxed, Organization Not Scattered, Results Consolidated:
    Guangfu Commune Persistently Persists in Spare-Time Learning
    The main experience is closely integrating with production, serving production.
    Compile supplementary teaching materials according to the principle of "learn what you do." Learning forms are diverse, including field learning and classroom learning. In terms of learning time, learn less during busy periods, learn more during less busy periods, and study intensively when not busy, persisting in learning throughout the year.
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, the Guangfu People's Commune in Wuxian County, Jiangsu Province, has consistently persisted in spare-time cultural education work since last winter. Currently, more than 4,000 young and middle-aged people in the entire commune are participating in learning, accounting for more than 80% of the total number of young and middle-aged people who should be enrolled. The study time is in the evening, four to five times a week, each time about one and a half hours. Efforts are made to persist in learning even during the busy seasons of summer harvesting and planting and drought resistance. Some teams use daytime rest time in the fields to study if they cannot study at night. For example, the Jinjian Brigade needs to use eight waterwheels to pump water to high fields for drought resistance, and the students use the time of rotation and rest to study next to the waterwheels. Because they can persist in learning even during busy times, they have achieved ideological non-relaxation, organizational non-dispersion, and result consolidation, and they study even better after busy times. Before liberation, 92% of the young and middle-aged people in this commune were illiterate or semi-literate. Since liberation, a lot of progress has been made in eliminating illiteracy over the years, but because there was no persistent learning throughout the year in the past, many people removed the label of illiteracy in winter and relapsed in the summer of the following year. By the end of July last year, the number of illiterate people among young and middle-aged people still accounted for 81%. After the intensive literacy campaign last autumn and nearly a year of persistent consolidation and learning, a large number of young and middle-aged people have shed their illiteracy hats and entered spare-time senior primary school classes to continue to consolidate and improve. The number of illiterate and semi-literate people among young and middle-aged people has decreased from 81% to 57%. Among these 57% of illiterate and semi-literate people, most are older, and the largest number are women with many children. Most of these people can recognize hundreds of characters, can record work points, and read dispatch cards and published accounts. Illiterates who cannot recognize a single character like before are only very few.
    Why can the party organization of the Guangfu Commune persist in spare-time cultural education in the context of the Great Leap Forward in production, with heavy tasks, a lot of work, little time, and tight labor? First of all, it adheres to the principle that spare-time cultural education must be closely integrated with production and serve production. In terms of learning content, in addition to using cultural textbooks compiled by the county and special district, supplementary teaching materials are also used. The supplementary teaching materials are compiled by the commune teams according to the principle of "learn what you do" based on the current central tasks of production. For example, when rice needs to be treated for diseases and insect pests, many supplementary teaching materials for eliminating insects and treating diseases are compiled for teaching. After learning, the students learned about the harm of diseases and insects to production and, according to the methods introduced in the teaching materials, made their own native pesticides to prevent and control diseases and insects. This year, the work of preventing and controlling diseases and insects in rice in the entire commune was almost entirely done by the students of the cultural and technical schools. They did it quickly and well, which has greatly contributed to this year's rice harvest. In addition, supplementary teaching materials such as "The People's Commune is Good" and "Oppose Right-leaning and Encourage Enthusiasm" greatly stimulated the students' political enthusiasm and encouraged their production enthusiasm. After learning the supplementary teaching material "Preparing for Autumn Harvest and Autumn Planting," the young students of Tianshe Brigade started leveling the ground after class and leveled a drying ground overnight, firing the first shot of the autumn harvest and autumn planting. Many cadres reflected that running spare-time cultural and technical schools has three advantages: first, it improves cultural level; second, it improves political awareness; and third, it benefits the Great Leap Forward in production.
    In order to be able to combine with production, Guangfu Commune's spare-time cultural education also adopted flexible and diverse methods. In terms of learning forms, there are field learning and classroom learning. In terms of learning time, learn less during busy periods, learn more during less busy periods, study intensively when not busy, and persist in learning throughout the year. Under normal circumstances, you have to study every day, but learning can also be suspended for two or three days in the event of particularly urgent tasks. It is precisely because these flexible and diverse methods are adopted that learning can be persisted in and can also promote the leap forward in production.
    In the study, the Party Committee also paid attention to solving practical difficulties in the study. For example, most of the young and middle-aged people who have not been enrolled are mothers with many children. In order to give this part of the population the opportunity to study, the commune recently launched night nurseries and night kindergartens with Tianshe Brigade as a pilot, increasing the enrollment of young and middle-aged people in this brigade to 98%. It is now preparing to promote this experience throughout the commune so that more people can shed their illiteracy hats and improve their cultural level.
    The intense battle of autumn harvest and autumn planting will soon be fully launched in Guangfu Commune. Here, the commune and team cadres, while considering production, are arranging spare-time cultural learning at the same time. A cultural learning movement closely integrated with production will be further launched in the endless golden fields by the Taihu Lake.

    思想不松　组织不散　成果巩固
    光福公社常年坚持业余学习
    主要经验紧密结合生产，为生产服务。
    按照“做什么，学什么”的原则编写补充教材。学习形式多种多样，有田头学习和课堂学习。在学习时间上是大忙少学，小忙多学，不忙突击学，常年坚持学。
    本报讯　江苏吴县光福人民公社在生产大跃进的形势下，从去冬以来，一直坚持业余文化教育工作。目前全公社有四千多青壮年参加学习，占应入学青壮年总数的80％以上。学习时间在晚上，每周学习四至五次，每次一个半小时左右。在夏收夏种和抗旱大忙期间也尽可能坚持学习。有的队晚上不能学就利用白天休息时间在田头学。如金涧大队要用八道水车翻水上高田抗旱，学员们就利用轮换休息的时间在水车旁学。由于在大忙时都能坚持学习，因而做到了思想不松、组织不散、成果巩固，大忙以后就学得更好了。解放前这个公社的青壮年有92％是文盲和半文盲。解放以来历年扫盲工作取得了不少成绩，但由于过去没有常年坚持学习，因而许多人冬天摘了文盲帽子，来年夏天又回生复盲。到去年7月底，青壮年中的文盲数仍然占81％。经过去年秋天的突击扫盲，和将近一年的坚持巩固学习，有很大一部分青壮年脱掉了文盲帽，升入了业余高小班，继续巩固和提高，青壮年中的文盲和半文盲，由81％下降到57％。在这57％的文盲和半文盲里面，大部分是年龄较大的，其中最多的又是子女多的妇女。这些人大都能识几百字，能够记工分，看派工牌和公布的账目，像从前那种一字不识的文盲只是极个别的了。
    光福公社党组织为什么能在生产大跃进的情况下，在任务重、工作多、时间少、劳力紧的情况下，坚持业余文化教育？首先是坚持了业余文化教育必须紧密结合生产、为生产服务的原则。在学习内容方面，除了采用县和专区编的文化课本以外，还采用补充教材，补充教材是社队按照“做什么，学什么”的原则，根据当前生产中心任务编写的。如水稻需要除病虫害时，即编写了许多除虫治病的补充教材来教学。学员们学了以后，知道了病虫对生产的危害，并根据教材上介绍的方法，自己动手配制土农药来防治病虫。今年全社水稻的防治病虫工作，差不多完全是文化技术学校的学员干的。他们干得又快又好，对今年水稻丰收有很大作用。此外，像“人民公社好”、“反右倾、鼓干劲”等补充教材，大大激发了学员的政治热情，鼓舞了他们的生产干劲。田舍大队的青年学员学了“准备秋收秋种”的补充教材后，一下课就动手平场地，一夜工夫平好了一块晒谷场，打响了秋收秋种第一炮。许多干部反映：办好业余文化技术学校有三利：一利提高文化水平，二利提高政治觉悟，三利生产大跃进。
    光福公社的业余文化教育为了能够结合生产，还采用了灵活多样的方式方法。在学习形式上有田头学习和课堂学习。在学习时间上是大忙少学，小忙多学，不忙突击学，常年坚持学。在一般情况下每天都要学习，但遇到特别紧急的任务，学习也可以暂停两三天。正因为采取了这些灵活多样的方式方法，才使学习能够坚持下来，并且还能推动生产跃进。
    在学习中，党委还注意解决学习中的实际困难。例如：未入学的青壮年大部分是多子女母亲，为了使这一部分人也有机会学习，最近公社以田舍大队为试点，举办了夜托儿所和夜幼儿园，使这个大队入学的青壮年增加到98％。目前正准备在全公社推广这一经验，使更多的人能够脱掉文盲帽子，提高文化水平。
    紧张的秋收秋种战斗，很快就要在光福公社全面展开了。这里的社队干部，在考虑生产的同时，都把业余文化学习同时进行安排。一个和生产紧密结合的文化学习运动，即将在太湖边上，一望无际的金色田野里进一步展开。
