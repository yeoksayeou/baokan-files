Singing of East Liangshan

    East Liangshan,
    East Liangshan,
    Barren and arid land transformed into a water paradise,
    Every household enjoys running water,
    Every home has electricity to light the lamps,
    The mountains are verdant, the waters clear, a garden landscape,
    The scenery is as beautiful as the regions south of the Yangtze River.
    The miserable era of East Liangshan, where the long-standing saying "Poor North Mountain, rich South Mountain, East Liangshan is bitterly arid, carrying water and grinding flour requires going down the mountain, daughters should not marry into the Bai family mountain: Bai family mountain, Bai family mountain, drinking water is more difficult than eating oil, going to fetch water at the first crow of the rooster, returning as the sun sets in the west," has gone forever.

    歌唱东梁山
    东梁山，
    东梁山，
    苦焦干旱变水川，
    家家安上自来水，
    户户有电把灯点，
    山清水秀园林化，
    风光秀丽赛江南。
    过去东梁山流传多年的“穷北山，富南山，苦焦不过东梁山，担水磨面要下山，有女不嫁柏家山：柏家山，柏家山，吃水倒比吃油难，鸡叫头遍去担水，回来太阳落西山。”的悲惨时代已经一去不复返了。
