    Awakening the Thousand-Year-Sleeping Fertile Fields on the Shores of Poyang Lake
    Jiangxi Comprehensively Reclaims Lake Fields and洲Land
    The Overwintering Crops on 400,000 Mu of Newly Reclaimed Land are Already a Patch of Green
    (Our dispatch) The vast lake fields and 洲land sleeping for thousands of years on the shores of Poyang Lake have begun to awaken under the mighty power of the People's Communes! Hundreds of thousands of commune members in Jiangxi Province are reclaiming large areas of wasteland on the lake fields and洲land. They have put forward the bold slogan: "Turn lake fields into oil depots, and let洲land offer new grain!"
    On the shores of Poyang Lake, stretching thousands of miles, since the beginning of October, the People's Communes of twenty-four counties, including Hukou, Duchang, Jiujiang, Boyang, Jinxian, and Nanchang, have organized more than 110,000 men and women commune members. They have concentrated and deployed more than 170 tractors and tens of thousands of head of cattle, carrying grain and fodder into the lake fields and洲land. Up to now, more than 570,000 mu of lake fields and洲land have been reclaimed, and more than 400,000 mu have been sown with overwintering crops such as rapeseed and wheat. The early-sown rapeseed has already emerged and put forth leaves, and the lush seedlings have turned the once barren land into a neat and lovely green carpet.
    Developing and utilizing lake fields and洲land has been the ideal of farmers in the lake area for many years. However, large-scale reclamation, sowing, and harvesting, as well as seizing the season and time, requires a large concentration of manpower and material resources. This was simply impossible in the past. Before liberation, landlords and despots seized these lake fields and洲land for themselves, using them as pastures. After liberation, individual farmers, elementary cooperatives, and advanced cooperatives had sporadically and on a small scale reclaimed and tried planting, but due to the limitations of manpower and material resources, there were often no harvests, or land disputes arose between regions because the reclamation of洲land and pastures could not be planned uniformly. Faced with this great treasure trove, people lamented the lack of a "key."
    The widespread establishment of People's Communes has provided possible conditions for realizing the ideal of developing lake fields and洲land. Based on this new condition, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to further tap the potential for increased production in the lake area, issued a call to the entire province in September this year to comprehensively develop and utilize lake fields and洲land. According to the requirements of the Provincial Committee, 2 million mu of wasteland will be reclaimed and sown in two phases this winter, with the first phase completing 500,000 mu before the Beginning of Winter (approx. Nov 7). At the same time, it is required that on the basis of the experience gained this year, the utilization of lake fields will gradually shift from planting a single season of overwintering crops to a perennial system of enclosure-based cultivation and farming. According to the regulations of the Provincial Committee, the right to use the newly reclaimed land is basically fixed: if the farm reclaims and plants, the harvest belongs to the farm; if the commune reclaims and plants, the harvest belongs to the commune; and no agricultural tax will be levied on the harvested crops.
    In the movement to reclaim lake fields and洲land, the unparalleled superiority of the People's Communes' large collective has solved difficulties that could not be solved in the past, and accomplished things that could not be done in the past. In the past, disputes often arose in the lake area over the division of洲land pastures. Now, because each commune has implemented unified leadership and unified production planning on a larger regional scale, a unified adjustment of reclamation and pastures has been carried out when planning the utilization of lake fields and洲land. The Beigang, Nangang, and Buhu洲lands in Hukou County cover an area of 10,000 mu and span five or six communes. Historically, there were the most disputes between townships and villages over洲land pastures. This time, when each commune unifiedly planned reclamation, not only was the arrangement of洲land reclamation and pastures within a single commune smoothly carried out, but the interspersed洲lands between communes were also mutually adjusted. Some neighboring areas, in order to reclaim more洲land, even established jointly used pastures.
    Large-scale reclamation and planting is urgent, and at the same time, it is also a busy time for the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing) and water conservancy construction, so manpower and material resources are quite tight. However, the People's Communes' abundant manpower and material resources completely overcame these difficulties. In order to ensure that production tasks were not missed and that success was achieved in all areas, the People's Communes in various places made comprehensive arrangements for production and reclamation. In terms of reclamation, the universal approach was to mobilize all the people, wage large-scale battles, carry out large-scale cooperation and focus on key areas, while taking overall care of all aspects. In terms of manpower, livestock power, and material resources, if one team was insufficient, the entire commune would provide support; if one commune was insufficient, other communes would provide support, and even counties from outside would provide support. In Xingzi County, each commune had a lot of farmland but little labor. In order to ensure that both reclamation and autumn harvesting and winter planting were not neglected, they tried to find ways to tap labor to participate in autumn harvesting and winter planting, thereby drawing 10,000 laborers to invest in the reclamation of lake fields and洲land. The sixteen communes and reclamation farms in Hukou County formed four reclamation areas, cooperating and supporting each other. While ensuring the "Three Autumns" tasks, they concentrated more than 18,000 laborers, more than 1,500 head of cattle, and six tractors, ensuring an average reclamation speed of more than 2,000 mu per day. People's Communes in Yugan, Boyang, and Duchang counties all broke down the boundaries between teams and communes, adopting the method of large-scale cooperation for autumn harvesting and large-scale cooperation for reclamation. After concentrating the main forces in the previous stage to focus on autumn harvesting, they immediately shifted the labor and livestock power to focus on reclamation and planting, ensuring that both autumn harvesting and reclamation were not neglected. Many areas far from Poyang Lake, such as many People's Communes, state-owned farms, and tractor stations in Wuyuan, Wuning, and Xiushui counties, sent expedition teams or drew tractors, cattle, farm tools, etc. to support the reclamation and planting in the lake area. In the large-scale cooperation and support, the principle of equal value exchange of exchanging labor for labor and paying for work according to work was conscientiously implemented.
    Because the People's Commune is an organization that combines government and commune and integrates workers, farmers, merchants, students, and soldiers, the commune-run industry, commerce, hospitals, etc. also provided strong support to the reclamation personnel under the unified arrangement of the commune. With the start of the reclamation work, a large number of handicraft workers moved to the reclamation site to manufacture and repair agricultural tools on the spot. The commercial departments set up temporary supply stations or mobile peddlers on the construction site to supply the commune members with the items they needed at any time. The medical departments set up temporary health clinics and medical stations on the construction site, making rounds to diagnose and treat the commune members.

### 唤醒鄱阳湖滨沉睡千年的沃野  江西全面开垦湖田洲地  四十万亩新垦地上的越冬作物已一片新绿

    唤醒鄱阳湖滨沉睡千年的沃野
    江西全面开垦湖田洲地
    四十万亩新垦地上的越冬作物已一片新绿
    本报讯　鄱阳湖滨沉睡千载的大片湖田洲地，在人民公社的强大威力下开始苏醒了！江西省数十万公社社员正在向湖田洲地上大面积垦荒，他们提出了“要湖田变油仓，要洲地献新粮！”的豪迈口号。
    在纵横千里的鄱阳湖滨，从10月初以来，湖口、都昌、九江、波阳、进贤、南昌等二十四个县的人民公社，组织了十一万多男女社员，集中抽调了一百七十多台拖拉机和数万头耕牛，携粮带草进入了湖田洲地。到现在已经开垦出湖田洲地五十七万多亩，有四十多万亩已播种下油菜和大小麦等越冬作物。播种早的油菜已经出土放叶，肥嫩的幼苗把过去荒芜的土地组成了一片整齐可爱的绿毯。
    开发和利用湖田洲地，是滨湖地区农民多少年来的理想。但是，要大面积的垦荒、播种、收割，又要抓住季节、抢住时间，就需要集中大量的人力、物力。这在过去是根本不可能的。解放前，地主恶霸将这些湖田洲地占为己有，作为牧场。解放后，个体农民、初级社、高级社虽然零星的、小面积的开垦过、试种过，但终因人力物力的限制，亦多有种无收，或者因为开垦洲地与牧场不能统一规划，而造成地区之间的土地纠纷。面对着这个大宝库，人们慨叹没有“钥匙”。
    人民公社的普遍建立，为开发湖田洲地的理想提供了可能的条件。中共江西省委根据这种新的条件，为了进一步挖掘湖区增产潜力，于今年9月间向全省发出了全面开发和利用湖田洲地的号召。按照省委的要求，今冬将分两期完成二百万亩的垦荒播种任务，其中第一期在立冬前完成五十万亩。同时要求在今年取得经验的基础上，今后把湖田利用逐步由种一季越冬作物转向常年围湖垦殖耕作制。按照省委规定，新垦荒地的使用权基本固定：农场开垦种植的，收获归场；公社开垦种植的，收获归社；收获的作物不征收公粮。
    在开垦湖田洲地的运动中，人民公社大集体的无比优越性，使过去解决不了的困难解决了，过去办不到的事情办到了。过去湖区为了洲地的牧场划分经常发生纠纷，现在各公社由于在更大地区范围内实行了统一领导和统一计划生产，在规划湖田洲地利用时，对垦荒和牧场进行了统一调整。湖口县北港、南港、埠湖三大洲地，面积万亩，地跨五、六个公社，历史上乡与乡、村与村洲地牧场纠纷最多；这次各个公社在统一规划开荒时，不仅在一个社内对开垦洲地和牧场顺利地进行了安排，各公社之间的插花洲地也互相作了调整，有的毗邻地区为了垦殖更多的洲地，还建立了共同使用的牧场。
    大规模的垦荒抢种，时间紧迫，同时又是“三秋”工作和兴修水利繁忙的时候，人力、物力都相当紧张。但是人民公社雄厚的人力、物力完全战胜了这些困难。为了作到生产项项不误，路路告捷，各地人民公社对生产和垦荒做了全面的安排。在垦荒方面，普遍采取了全民上阵、大兵团作战、大协作和重点突击、全面照顾的办法。在人力、畜力、物力上，一队不足，全社支援，一社不足，他社支援，甚至于外县支援。星子县各公社田多劳力少，为了作到开荒和秋收冬种两不误，设法挖掘劳力参加秋收冬种，从而抽调出一万劳力投入了开垦湖田洲地。湖口县十六个公社和垦殖场组成了四个垦荒区，互相协作、互相支援，在保证三秋工作的同时，集中了一万八千多劳力、一千五百多头耕牛和六台拖拉机，保证了每天平均垦荒二千亩以上的速度。余干、波阳、都昌等县人民公社都打破队界、社界，采取了大兵团协作秋收、大兵团协作垦荒的办法，在前一段集中主要力量突击秋收之后，立刻把劳力、畜力转向了突击垦荒抢种，保证了秋收、垦荒两不误。许多远离鄱阳湖的地区，如婺源、武宁、修水等县许多人民公社、国营农场、拖拉机站，都派出了远征队或抽出了拖拉机、耕牛、农具等支援湖区垦荒抢种。各地在大协作大支援中，认真贯彻了以工换工、计工付酬的等价交换原则。
    由于人民公社是政社合一和工农商学兵结合的组织，在公社统一安排下，社办工业、商业、医院等也给了垦荒人员以有力的支援。随同垦荒工作的开始，有大批手工业工人搬到垦荒工地，就地制造和修理农具。商业部门在工地上设立了临时供应站或流动货郎担，随时供应社员们需要的物品。医务部门在工地上设立了临时卫生所、医疗站，巡回为社员们诊伤看病。
