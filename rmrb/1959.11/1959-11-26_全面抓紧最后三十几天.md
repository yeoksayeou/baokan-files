Comrades on the industrial and transportation fronts are working with great enthusiasm to make even greater contributions to completing this year's plan ahead of schedule and exceeding targets. The current situation is like a 10,000-meter race; 9,000 meters have already been run, run quickly and well, and a new record will surely be created. Only the last 1,000 meters remain. We must continue our efforts, exert our final strength, and reach the finish line victoriously!

This year's industrial production and transportation plan is one of continued leaps forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. Since the beginning of the year, the nation's workers have made tremendous efforts to realize this plan and have achieved remarkable successes. Especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the mass movement of opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and vigorously increasing production and practicing thrift has rapidly formed a new high tide, and the production situation is even more thriving. There is now full confidence to assert that this year's industrial production and transportation plan will definitely be completed ahead of schedule and exceeded.

However, we must never become complacent because of this. "Building a mountain nine ren high" can still "fall short of success for lack of one basket of earth." In a 10,000-meter race, it is also possible to fall behind in the last 1,000 meters. If we become complacent because we are confident of completing this year's plan ahead of schedule and exceeding targets, and relax our efforts in the last thirty-odd days, we may not achieve the even greater victory that we could have achieved. Our working class and its vanguard, the Communist Party, are never complacent. Because we have the most ambitious goals, any achievement can only strengthen our confidence and strength to continue to move forward, and cannot make us complacent and stop moving forward. We must carry forward the true qualities of the working class, grasp tighter as we get closer to the end, and never underestimate a task just because it is light. "To lift a light weight as if it were heavy," and "He who travels a hundred li considers ninety as half the journey." We must steadfastly seize the last thirty-odd days. At the beginning of the year, many places proposed the slogan "Grasp tightly from the beginning, and grasp tightly from beginning to end." The first half of this slogan has already been achieved. How the second half will be done depends on these last thirty-odd days. If we grasped tightly at the beginning and also grasp tightly at the end, we will be able to achieve even greater success in completing this year's industrial production and transportation plan ahead of schedule and exceeding targets.

Grasping these last thirty-odd days is first to achieve a better and more comprehensive victory this year, and at the same time, it is to seize the production preparations for next year. Industrial production is continuous; today's production does not start from today, but from yesterday and the day before. This is especially true for heavy industry production. The production of many products needs to be prepared several months in advance. In these last thirty-odd days of the year, the work we do is recorded in this year's accounts, but in fact, much of it is preparing for next year's production. A large part of the steel, coal, cement, wood, etc., produced now will be used at the very beginning of production and construction in the first quarter of next year. A large part of the various equipment produced now is urgently needed to supplement the industrial production in the first quarter of next year. A larger part of the materials transported now are being prepared for production in the first quarter of next year. It can be seen that seizing industrial production and transportation in the last thirty-odd days of the year is also an important preparation for industrial production in the first quarter of next year.

How to seize it? The most important thing is to continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and steadily and continuously increase production. The so-called seizing means giving fuller play to the subjective initiative of people and persevering in soaring enthusiasm to the end. Whether the seizing is tight or not, and whether the subjective initiative is fully utilized or not, has a decisive impact on the completion of the plan. This has been particularly evident this year. At the beginning of the year, the seizing was very tight, the enthusiasm was high, and the subjective initiative was fully utilized, so the production situation was very good. However, in June and July, right-leaning opportunists blew a gust of right-leaning cold wind, and the right-leaning thinking and slackening emotions of a few cadres also grew, deflating morale, loosening efforts, the seizing was not tight, and the subjective initiative was not utilized. As a result, production was affected. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the conditions did not change much as we opposed right-leaning tendencies, boosted morale, and resumed seizing efforts. Only the spiritual outlook of the people was greatly different, and the subjective initiative was fully utilized again, and the production situation changed immediately, showing a great situation of production surpassing one ten-day period after another and one month after another. Now we want to seize the last thirty-odd days of the year, which means continuing to deepen the opposition to right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, giving full play to the subjective initiative of the people, continuing to develop soaring enthusiasm, and steadily increasing production, striving to complete this year's plan more, faster, better, and more economically within the scope permitted by objective conditions.

What needs to be particularly emphasized at present is comprehensive and meticulous seizing. The last thirty-odd days of the year, for comprehensively completing this year's industrial production plan, are somewhat like agriculture entering the autumn harvest season and capital construction projects entering the final stage. On the one hand, a bumper harvest is indeed in sight, and a new building is about to be completed. On the other hand, the workload is still very large, and there are still many new problems that deserve attention. For example, although the vast majority of the annual plan has been completed, the production of some important products has not reached the predetermined target, and there are still some problems in completing the variety plan. In this case, some enterprises may only pay attention to completing the output and output value targets, while neglecting or poorly completing the quality, variety, and cost-saving targets. This is called the plan being completed incompletely and with shortcomings. The Party Central Committee has long pointed out that the goal of the continued leap forward of the national economy this year is a comprehensive leap forward of high output, high quality, multiple varieties, low cost, and safety. It is entirely appropriate and entirely possible to continue to achieve such a comprehensive leap forward in the last thirty-odd days. This requires seizing more comprehensively and fully realizing the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. For another example, the products that should be delivered this year according to the purchase contracts signed at the beginning of the year have also reached the final delivery deadline. Some mechanical products with large output value parts may have already been manufactured, so for mechanical factories, the vast majority of the output value plan may have been completed. However, it may be neglected that there are still some small parts that have not been manufactured. Although these small parts do not have a large output value, the lack of them will affect the entire product from being delivered on time. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a careful inspection and quickly complete the assembly, so that these products can be shipped out of the factory in complete sets as soon as possible. In short, the work at the end of the year must be seized very comprehensively and meticulously. If we only seize an output value plan, although we can exceed the annual output value plan target, but it is incomplete, the products cannot be shipped out of the factory, or the variety does not meet the needs, and the quality does not meet the requirements, then it cannot be said that favorable conditions have been created for next year's production. Therefore, leading cadres of factories, mines, and transportation enterprises should go to the front line of production, and according to the requirements of high output, high quality, multiple varieties, low cost, and safety, check the comprehensive completion of the plan, and promptly discover and solve problems. Leading cadres going to the front line of production to direct production is a very good leadership experience since the Great Leap Forward. Enterprises that have done this in the past have had very good production situations, and problems can be solved immediately, so that problems do not accumulate. Enterprises that have already done this should continue to do so in the future; enterprises that have not done so should do so even more.

In the production of the last thirty-odd days, we hope that workers across the country will give greater play to their enthusiasm and creativity, vigorously carry out technical innovations, and continue to develop the high tide of the mass movement of increasing production and practicing thrift. In the past ten months, workers across the country, especially millions of advanced producers, have made outstanding contributions to the completion of the national plan. We hope that those advanced producers who have entered 1960 ahead of schedule will continue their efforts, add flowers to the brocade, and use the last thirty-odd days to contribute another gift to the great 1959. We hope that those workers who have not yet completed this year's plan will keep up closely and use the last thirty-odd days to show their skills and complete this year's plan ahead of schedule and exceed targets. To ensure the continuous rise of production, we should mainly rely on putting politics in command and vigorously carrying out technical innovations, rather than simply relying on increasing labor intensity. At the recently held National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers on the Industrial, Transportation, Capital Construction, and Finance and Trade Fronts of Socialist Construction, the systematic advanced experiences of high output, high quality, multiple varieties, low cost, and safety in various industries were widely exchanged. As long as millions of workers master these advanced experiences, creatively apply them to their own production practices, and develop and improve them, we will surely be able to achieve better and more comprehensive leap forward results before the end of the year.

Comrades on the national industrial front, let us end 1959 with more outstanding production achievements and prepare to fire the first shot of the continued leap forward of industrial production in 1960!

### 全面抓紧最后三十几天

    全面抓紧最后三十几天
    1959年只剩下最后三十几天的时间了。工业、交通运输战线上的千百万职工，正在干劲冲天地为提前和超额完成今年的计划作出更大的贡献。现在的情况好比一万米的赛跑，已经跑完了九千米，跑得很快、很好，肯定将创造新纪录；前面只剩下最后一千米了，必须再接再厉，努最后一把力，达到胜利的终点！
    今年的工业生产和交通运输计划，是一个在去年大跃进的基础上继续跃进的计划。从年初开始，全国职工就为实现这个计划作了巨大的努力，取得了显著的成就。特别是党的八届八中全会以后，反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的群众运动迅速形成了新的高潮，生产情况更是蒸蒸日上。现在已经有了充分的把握可以断言：今年的工业生产和交通运输计划一定能够提前和超额完成。
  但是，我们决不能因此就自满起来。“为山九仞”还可能“功亏一篑”，一万米的赛跑也可能在最后一千米落在后面。如果我们以为已经有把握提前和超额完成今年的计划就自满起来，放松了最后三十几天时间的努力，就可能得不到本来可以得到的更大的胜利。我们工人阶级和它的先锋队共产党是永远不自满的。因为我们有着最远大的目标，任何成就只能增强我们继续前进的信心和力量，而不能使我们踌躇满志，止步不前。我们一定要发扬工人阶级的本色，越到最后越要抓紧，任务越轻越不能小看，“举轻若重”、“行百里者半九十”，必须踏踏实实地抓紧最后三十几天的时间。年初的时候，许多地方曾提出“一开始就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧”的口号。这个口号的前一半已经做到，后一半就看这最后三十几天的时间做得怎样了。开始抓紧了，最后也抓紧了，我们就能够在提前和超额完成今年的工业生产和交通运输计划中取得更大的成就。
    抓紧这最后三十几天的时间，首先是为了取得今年更好、更全面的胜利，同时也就是抓紧了明年的生产准备。工业生产是连续性的，今天的生产不是从今天开始，而是从昨天、前天就开始了。重工业的生产尤其是如此，许多产品的生产需要在几个月以前就开始准备。在这年终的三十几天的时间里，我们所做的工作虽然是记在今年的账上，实际上不少是为明年的生产作准备的。现在生产的钢材、煤炭、水泥、木材等等，很大一部分是明年第一季度的生产和建设中一开始就要用的。现在生产的各种设备，很大一部分是明年第一季度工业生产中亟待补充的生力军。现在运输的物资，更有很大一部分是为明年第一季度的生产作准备的。可见，抓紧年终三十几天时间的工业生产和交通运输，也就是为明年第一季度的工业生产做了重要准备。
    怎样抓紧呢？最主要的还是继续反右倾，鼓干劲，使生产稳步地持续地高涨。所谓抓紧，也就是更充分地发挥人的主观能动性，把冲天干劲坚持到底。抓得紧不紧，主观能动性发挥得够不够，对于完成计划的决定性的影响，在今年看得特别明显。年初的时候抓得很紧，干劲很足，主观能动性发挥得很充分，生产情况就很好。但是右倾机会主义分子在六、七月间吹来了一股右倾冷风，少数干部中的右倾思想、松劲情绪也随着滋长起来，泄了气，松了劲，抓得不紧了，主观能动性也不发挥了，结果，生产就受到了影响。党的八届八中全会以后，反右倾，鼓干劲，重新抓紧，客观条件并没有多少变化，只是人们的精神面貌大不相同，主观能动性又得到充分的发挥，生产情况马上就改变了，出现了生产一旬超一旬、一月超一月的大好形势。现在我们要抓紧年终最后的三十几天时间，也就是要继续深入地反右倾、鼓干劲，充分发挥人的主观能动性，把冲天的干劲持续地发展下去，使生产稳步上升，在客观条件所许可的范围内，力争更多更快更好更省地完成今年的计划。
    目前特别需要强调的是抓得全面，抓得细致。年终的最后三十几天时间，对于全面地完成今年工业生产计划来说，多少有些像农业进入秋收季节、基本建设工程进入扫尾阶段一样，一方面确实是丰收在望，新的大厦即将落成，另一方面工作量仍然很大，还有不少新的问题值得注意。例如，全年的计划虽然完成了绝大部分，但是还有一些重要产品的生产没有达到预定的目标，完成品种计划还有些问题。在这种情况下，有的企业可能发生只注意完成产量和产值指标，而对质量、品种、节约等指标比较忽视或者完成得很差，这就叫做计划完成得不完全、有缺点。党中央早就指出过，今年国民经济继续跃进的目标是高产、优质、多品种、低成本、安全的全面跃进，完全应该、也完全可能在最后三十几天的时间里继续做到这样的全面跃进。这就需要抓得更全面一些，全面地实现多快好省的要求。又例如，根据年初签订的订货合同，应该在今年内交货的产品，也已经到了最后的交货期限了。有些机械产品的产值大的部件可能已经制造出来，因而对机械工厂说来，可能已经完成了产值计划的绝大部分；但是却可能忽略了还有一些小零件没有制造出来，这些小零件虽然产值不大，缺了它却影响整个产品不能按期交货，因而需要细致地进行一次检查，迅速配套补齐，让这些产品成套地早日出厂。总之，年终的工作一定要抓得特别全面、特别细致。如果我们只抓一个产值计划，虽然也能超额完成全年的产值计划指标，但缺东少西，产品不能出厂，或品种不合需要，质量不合要求，这对于明年的生产来说，就不能说是创造了有利的条件。因此，厂矿和运输企业的领导干部要到生产第一线去，根据高产、优质、多品种、低成本、安全的要求，检查全面完成计划的情况，及时发现问题，解决问题。领导干部到生产第一线去指挥生产，这是大跃进以来一条很好的领导经验。过去这样做了的企业，生产情况都很好，有问题也能马上解决，不致使问题积累成堆。已经这样做了的企业，今后还要这样做；没有这样做的企业，更要这样做。
    在最后三十几天的生产中，我们希望全国职工发挥更大的积极性和创造性，大搞技术革新，把增产节约群众运动的高潮持续发展下去。过去十个多月中，全国职工，特别是几百万先进生产者，已经在完成国家计划中创立了卓越的功绩。我们希望那些提前进入1960年的先进生产者再接再厉，锦上添花，利用最后三十几天的时间，再为伟大的1959年贡献一件礼品；希望那些还没有完成今年计划的职工同志们紧紧跟上，利用最后三十几天的时间大显身手，提前和超额完成今年的计划。要保证生产的持续上升，主要应当依靠政治挂帅，大搞技术革新，而不要单纯依靠增加劳动强度。不久以前召开的全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸战线上社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会上，广泛交流了各行各业高产、优质、多品种、低成本、安全的系统的先进经验。只要千百万职工把这些先进经验掌握起来，创造性地运用到自己的生产实践中去，并且加以发展和提高，我们就一定能够在年底以前取得更好更全面的跃进成果。
    全国工业战线上的同志们，让我们用更出色的生产成就来结束1959年，并准备好打响1960年工业生产继续跃进的第一炮！
