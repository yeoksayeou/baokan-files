Workers and Peasants, Heart to Heart
Xiao Lin

The rural areas have just finished the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, plowing and sowing) and are now beginning the "Five Winters" (winter production activities), the historical winter leisure has long been replaced by winter busy-ness.

The countryside is supporting the cities, and the cities must support the countryside, and the cities are supporting the countryside. Look, Shanghai is supporting the countryside, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing, Shenyang, Harbin and many other cities are also rushing to produce various products to support the peasants. Taking Shanghai alone, through the commercial sector supplying industrial products to all parts of the country, this year, in addition to completing the state plan, it is prepared to transfer out more. Most of these industrial products are to be sold to the countryside. Although the working class and peasant brothers are in different production positions, their hearts are closely linked together.

Socialist commerce is a testament to this close relationship between urban and rural areas. When farmers work hard to sell their agricultural products, the commercial sector purchases them at fair and reasonable prices; at the same time, the commercial sector also supplies farmers with various industrial products at the same reasonable prices. These industrial products are of excellent quality, with a wide variety of designs, and meet the needs of the countryside; they include not only daily necessities, but also various means of production urgently needed by the countryside. You see, who can understand the worker-peasant alliance more intimately than socialist commercial workers, except for the workers and peasants themselves?

Since the founding of the country, industry and agriculture have undergone rapid development, and the commercial sector has also made great efforts between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between regions. Today, in the midst of opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, safeguarding the general line, and launching a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy; when the people's communes, after rectification and consolidation, are embarking on a path of sound development and construction; when industrial and agricultural production continues to leap forward, and will continue to leap forward next year; when the market situation is very favorable, purchases and sales are booming, and inventories are substantial; it is very important for commercial departments at all levels to make greater efforts, give full play to the role of commerce as a link in the national economy, and collect agricultural products well and in sufficient quantities. It is also very important to transport industrial products to all parts of the country quickly to meet the needs of the great leap forward in agricultural production, support the current agricultural product purchase campaign, and meet the growing living needs of farmers.

Commercial departments at all levels in urban and rural areas must redouble their efforts and make greater contributions. Urban-rural mutual assistance, common leap forward, this is our slogan.

    工人农民心连心
    萧林
    农村刚完成了三秋，又开始了五冬，历史上的冬闲早已为冬忙代替了。
    农村在支援城市，城市必须支援农村，城市也正在支援农村。看，上海在支援农村，天津、广州、武汉、重庆、沈阳、哈尔滨以及其他许多城市也正在为农民赶制各种产品支援农村。单以上海一地来看，通过商业部门供应全国各地的工业品，今年一年中，除完成国家计划以外，准备还要多调出一些。这些工业品大部分是要销到农村去的。工人阶级同农民兄弟尽管处在不同的生产岗位上，然而，他们的心却是紧贴在一起。
    社会主义商业就是城乡之间的这种亲密关系的见证。当农民努力出售自己生产出来的农产品的时候，商业部门以公平合理的价格收购；同时，商业部门也以同样合理的价格供应农民各种工业品。这些工业品品质优良，花色繁多，切合农村需要；不仅有日用品，还有农村迫切需要的各种生产资料。你看，除了工人、农民本身而外，谁能比社会主义商业工作者更亲切地了解工农联盟呢？
    建国以来，工业和农业有了飞跃的发展，商业部门在工农之间、城乡之间、地区之间也作了很大的努力。今天，在反右倾、鼓干劲，保卫总路线，开展增产节约新高潮的时候；在人民公社经过整顿巩固，走上健全发展和建设道路的时候；在工农业生产继续跃进，明年还要不断跃进的时候；在市场形势十分有利，购销旺盛，库存厚的时候；各级商业部门作出更大的努力，充分发挥商业在国民经济中的纽带作用，把农产品收好收足，是很重要的。把工业品迅速运送到全国各地，以适应农业生产大跃进的需要，支持当前农产品收购运动，满足农民日益增长的生活需要，也是很重要的。
    城乡各级商业部门必须加倍努力，作出更多的贡献。城乡互助，共同跃进，这就是我们的口号。
