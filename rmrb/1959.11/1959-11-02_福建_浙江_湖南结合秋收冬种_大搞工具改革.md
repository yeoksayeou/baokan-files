Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 1st: A tool reform movement is surging to a new high in Fujian, as various localities are combining autumn harvest, winter planting, and tool preparation for next year’s massive production efforts. To date, more than 5.7 million units of rapid harvesters and other improved farm tools have been manufactured and promoted throughout the province, along with more than 10 million small farm implements.

Adopting the experiences of last year’s Great Leap Forward in tool reform, localities are continuing to promote a daring and energetic style of work and vigorously engage in mass movements. Currently, the number of people involved in the autumn harvest tool reform movement alone has reached over 500,000. The Fu'an Special District organized 525 farm tool factories, repair stations, and 113 specialized farm tool teams to reform tools, while also organizing more than 5,000 people to go up the mountains and down to the fields to repair and manufacture farm tools on the spot.

The Party's call against Right-leaning tendencies and to boost morale has further spurred the enthusiasm of cadres and commune members for tool reform. Since early August, various localities have launched a tool reform movement with the slogan "Take labor from tools and seize an all-round bumper harvest." They have widely organized on-site observation meetings, dispatched mobile performance teams to the fields, trained operators of new farm tools, and established new farm tool repair networks, enabling the tool reform movement to unfold rapidly in conjunction with production.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, November 1st: Zhejiang is widely carrying out tool reform in the autumn harvest and winter planting, with 6.15 million newly made tools for harvesting, threshing, deep plowing, and transportation, and over 9.7 million pieces of existing farm tools have been renovated and repaired. The use of these tools in the autumn harvest and winter planting has greatly accelerated the pace of production.

Workers on the industrial and handicraft fronts in Zhejiang are rushing to repair and manufacture tools. Recently, in addition to rushing to repair all 200,000 rice threshers in the province, they have also used the power of water pumps to convert power-driven combined rice threshers and power-driven combined sweet potato shredders.

Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over this year's tool reform movement. Secretaries personally conduct experiments. People's communes and production teams have all held tool technology training classes and on-site skill comparison meetings, organized mobile performances to impart technology, and established specialized teams to vigorously carry out the high-efficiency movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 1st: Hunan's Changde Special District has launched a mass-based tool reform movement centered around current production, effectively promoting the continued leap forward in production. In Yiyang County, the original wooden rice threshers operated manually were converted to be driven by foot-operated waterwheels, increasing efficiency by two to four times and greatly reducing labor intensity. The animal-powered rice mills, which are vigorously promoted throughout the district, use one ox to drive them and can mill three to four thousand catties of rice per day, increasing efficiency more than twenty times compared to manual labor. In the past, processing rice throughout the district occupied more than 50,000 laborers, but now it has been reduced to more than 35,000 people.

The new high tide of tool reform in Changde Special District was sparked after the implementation of the Party Central Committee's call to oppose Right-leaning tendencies and boost morale. All localities criticized so-called Right-leaning conservative ideas such as "tool reform is not worth the loss," "wastes materials," and "can be tested but not carried out on a large scale." Party committee secretaries at all levels personally took action, using methods such as focusing on key breakthroughs, on-site observation performances, comparing new and old tools, and training skilled technicians to vigorously promote improved tools.

    福建  浙江  湖南结合秋收冬种
    大搞工具改革
    据新华社福州1日电　福建各地为秋收、冬种和明年大生产赶制工具而掀起的工具改革运动已经形成新的高潮。到目前为止，各地已制造和推广快速收割器和其他改良农具五百七十多万件，各种小农具一千多万件。
    各地吸取了去年大跃进中工具改革的经验，继续发扬敢想敢干的风格，大搞群众运动。目前各地单是投入大搞秋收工具改革运动的人数即达五十多万人。福安专区把五百二十五个农具厂、修配站和一百一十三个农具专业队组织起来改革工具，同时还组织五千多人上山下田就地修造农具。
    党的反右倾、鼓干劲的号召更加鼓足了广大干部和社员改革工具的干劲，从今年8月上旬起，各地纷纷掀起“向工具要劳力，夺取全面大丰收”的工具改革运动，广泛组织现场观摩会、组织巡回表演队下田表演、训练新式农具手和建立新农具修配网等，使工具改革运动结合生产迅速展开。
    据新华社杭州1日电　浙江各地在秋收冬种中，广泛地开展了工具改革运动，新制成收割、脱粒、深耕、运输等工具六百一十五万件，改装修理好各种现有农具九百七十万余件。这些工具投入秋收冬种后，生产进度大大加快。
    浙江工业和手工业战线上的工人们，正在赶修赶制工具，最近除将全省二十万部打稻机全部抢修好外，还利用抽水机的动力改装动力联合打稻机、动力联合番薯刨丝机。
    各级党委都加强了对今年工具改革运动的领导，书记亲自搞试验，各人民公社、生产队，都举办了工具技术训练班和现场比巧会议，组织巡回表演传授技术，并建立专业队，大力开展了高工效运动。
    据新华社长沙1日电　湖南常德专区围绕当前生产，掀起了群众性的工具改革运动，有力地促进了生产的继续跃进。益阳县把原来用手工操作的木制打稻机改成用脚踏水车带动，工效提高二至四倍，劳动强度也大大减轻。全区各地大力推广的畜力碾米机，用一条牛带动，一天可碾三、四千斤米，比人力提高工效二十多倍。过去全区加工大米占用五万多个劳动力，现在已减少到三万五千多人。
    常德专区工具改革的新高潮，是在贯彻了党中央反右倾、鼓干劲的号召后掀起来的，各地都批判了所谓“工具改革得不偿失”、“浪费材料”、“可以试验不能大搞”等右倾保守思想。各级党委书记亲自动手，用重点突击、现场观摩表演、新旧工具比武、训练技术能手等方法，大力推广改良工具。
