Lin Boqu, Vice Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee and head of the NPC delegation that recently visited the Mongolian People's Republic, reported on the delegation's visit to Mongolia in late August and early September. In his report, Lin Boqu vividly described the warm welcome and cordial reception given to the delegation by Mongolian Party and government leaders and the entire Mongolian people. He spoke of the remarkable achievements of the Mongolian people in various socialist construction undertakings such as agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, culture, and education.

They fully agree with the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, considering it an important resolution to summarize the experience of the Great Leap Forward and continue the leap forward. They greatly value the deep friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples and repeatedly mentioned China's assistance to the Mongolian people in their talks."

Great achievements have already been made in the production of industry, agriculture and animal husbandry. There are now more than 23 million head of livestock in the country, an average of 27 head per person. The collectivization of agriculture and animal husbandry has been completed, which is a great victory. In terms of industry, there are food industries, leather processing industries, construction industries, textile industries, power industries, and mining industries, etc. With the development of industry, the ranks of the Mongolian working class have grown, and the number of employees has now reached more than 100,000.

At present, one in every six people in the country is studying at school. Illiteracy has been basically eliminated nationwide, and compulsory primary education has been popularized.

In the final part of his report, Lin Boqu said: "The Mongolian people have a great spirit of internationalism, and their warm and enthusiastic welcome and meticulous care for the delegation is an expression of their deep friendship with the Chinese people." "Through this visit, we are deeply convinced that it will further deepen the mutual understanding between the two peoples and enhance the profound friendship between the two countries."
