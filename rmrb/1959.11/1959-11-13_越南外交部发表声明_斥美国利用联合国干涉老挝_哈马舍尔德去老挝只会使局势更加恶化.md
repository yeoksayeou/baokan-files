Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 12th: The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today saying that UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's trip to Laos is inopportune.

The statement said that after the report of the so-called "Subcommittee to Investigate the Situation in Laos" dispatched by the UN Security Council was published, people have seen that the lies that U.S. imperialism and pro-American elements in the Lao Phoui Sananikone government have long fabricated to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have been completely discredited.

However, U.S. imperialism continues to pursue a policy of strengthening interference in Laos, attempting to turn Laos into a U.S. colony and military base, threatening the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

In order to cover up this sinister plot, they are working with the Sananikone government to try every means to maintain the illegal presence of the United Nations in Laos in order to squeeze out the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos and abolish the Geneva Agreements on Laos.

The statement said that under these circumstances, the UN Secretariat issued a notice stating that UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, at the invitation of the Sananikone government, will soon "visit" Laos. Western news also reported that Hammarskjöld will soon send a representative of the UN Secretary-General as a permanent observer in Laos.

The statement said that the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the UN Secretary-General's trip to Laos is inopportune, which will only harm the peaceful settlement of the Lao issue on the basis of strict implementation of the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements, and that sending a permanent UN representative to Laos violates the Geneva Agreements and the UN Charter. These are all part of the vicious plot of U.S. imperialism to further intensify its interference in Laos under the banner of the United Nations.

These actions will not help solve the Lao problem at all, but will only worsen the situation in Laos.

The statement said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly opposes the plot of U.S. imperialism and the Sananikone government to establish a permanent UN body in Laos, no matter what form it takes.

The statement said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the only way to solve the Lao problem is to respect and thoroughly implement the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements on Laos. At present, the activities of the International Commission for Laos must be restored as soon as possible. If this cannot be achieved, a conference of the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina must be convened immediately, as suggested by the Soviet government, to seek ways to normalize the situation in Laos.

### 越南外交部发表声明  斥美国利用联合国干涉老挝  哈马舍尔德去老挝只会使局势更加恶化

    越南外交部发表声明
    斥美国利用联合国干涉老挝
    哈马舍尔德去老挝只会使局势更加恶化
    新华社河内12日电　越南民主共和国外交部今天发表声明说，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德这次老挝之行是不合时宜的。
    声明说，在联合国安全理事会派遣的所谓“调查老挝局势小组委员会”的报告公布以后，人们都看到了美帝国主义和老挝培·萨纳尼空政府中的亲美分子长久以来诬蔑越南民主共和国的谎言已经完全破产。
    可是，美帝国主义仍然继续奉行着加强干涉老挝的政策，企图把老挝变成美国的殖民地和军事基地，威胁越南民主共和国的安全。
    为了掩饰这个恶毒阴谋，它们正在同萨纳尼空政府一起想尽办法来维持联合国在老挝的非法的存在，以便挤掉老挝国际监察和监督委员会，并且取消关于老挝的日内瓦协议。
    声明说，就在这种情况下，联合国秘书处发出通告说，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德应萨纳尼空政府的邀请，即将“访问”老挝。西方消息也报道说，哈马舍尔德即将派遣一个联合国秘书长代表作为常驻老挝的观察员。
    声明说，越南民主共和国外交部认为，联合国秘书长这次的老挝之行是不合时宜的，这只有害于老挝问题在严正履行日内瓦协议和万象协议基础上的和平解决，而且派遣联合国常驻老挝代表是违反日内瓦协议和联合国宪章的。这些都是美帝国主义打着联合国的旗帜进一步加紧干涉老挝的恶毒阴谋的一部分。
    这些行为不但丝毫无助于老挝问题的解决，反而会使老挝的局势更加恶化。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府强烈反对美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府企图在老挝设立联合国常设机构的阴谋，不管它所采取的是那一种形式。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府认为，解决老挝问题的唯一途径是，尊重和彻底履行关于老挝的日内瓦协议和万象协议。在目前，必须尽快恢复老挝国际委员会的活动。这一点如果还不能实现，就必须按照苏联政府的建议，立即召开1954年印度支那问题的日内瓦会议参加国会议，以寻求促使老挝局势正常化的办法。
