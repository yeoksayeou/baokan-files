We often say that the feelings of the working class are the most noble and precious of all human emotions, and this usually refers to the feelings of the working class towards people, that is, towards their own class brothers and all working people. Let's talk about a few small things that have happened recently: Tian Yulin, a waiter at the Qianmen Hotel, has to carry Comrade Chen Guoxia from her room to the car every day, and then carry her from the car back to her room after meetings. When we see Chen Guoxia, who burned her leg while rescuing state property, emerging from the car, clinging tightly to Comrade Tian Yulin's back, her hands clasping his chest, her two braids hanging on either side of his arms, a childlike smile on her face; and Tian Yulin, bending slightly, a smile on his face, tightly holding her legs with his hands, steadily walking towards the stairs of the hotel building (the People's Daily published such a photo on page 3 on November 1st), how can we not feel that such a feeling is several times better than that of siblings born of the same mother!

The old car driver Yu Jufu brought his most beloved set of antique tea sets from home to the car and used it to make hot tea for the "National Advanced Workers Representatives Conference" delegates he was transporting. Does not this kind of love for class brothers exceed that of an ordinary father?

Sun Guangji, a delegate from the Qinghai Province delegation, praised the Qianmen Hotel's service staff, saying, "Their deep affection for people is like Qinghai Lake." This is another interactive reflection of class feelings.

Tian Yulin and Yu Jufu are ordinary members of our class, and they are not the most outstanding representatives. The names of those "affectionate as a lake" service staff are not even known to the general readers. This just shows that these touching things are just the most ordinary, most common, and most natural expressions of the feelings of the working class.

Since the working class is so fond of its own class brothers and all working people, then what about its feelings towards things, specifically towards all state and public property, and all the fruits of the labor of the working people? Its love is no less than its love for people.

The aforementioned Chen Guoxia, did she not sacrifice one of her legs to rescue state property? And Xu Xuehui, another delegate attending the National Advanced Workers Representatives Conference, is not another hero who defended state property with her life? As for Xiang Xiuli of Guangdong, and all the Xiang Xiuli-style heroes, their highly sacrificial spirit of loving state property, which moves the sun and the moon and illuminates the heavens and the earth, is well known to everyone. If the above are all prominent manifestations of the working class's spirit of loving things when state property is under serious threat, and thus can deeply move people, then the working class's spirit of loving things in its daily and general manifestations is also very touching.

Among the delegates to the National Advanced Workers Representatives Conference, there was such a person who loved things, named Su Changfu. Su Changfu is an ordinary car driver, but he is also a special-grade labor model of the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region, and he has also won the glorious title of outstanding party member. This comrade has been driving a Soviet ZIS-150 truck since July 26, 1951, for more than eight years, and the entire car has not been short of even a small screw. Needless to say, there have never been any rollover or casualty accidents, and the car has never broken down halfway. It is this Su Changfu who has driven 500,000 kilometers without overhauling the car, while under normal circumstances, it would need to be overhauled ten times during this period.

Here, there is no need to comprehensively introduce his model deeds, but let's take a look at his care and feelings for the car. "His ears are always paying attention to the sound of the parts, and if he encounters an obstruction, whether on the Gobi Desert or on the snow and ice, he does not tire of stopping and crawling under the car to check, even if a screw is loose, he has to tighten it before continuing. ...When driving an empty car, he uses a rope to tie the car box to the girder to prevent the car box from vibrating, and when a heavy car stops, he uses a wooden stick to prop up the rear of the car." (Excerpt from the Worker's Daily, October 8th) He does not regard the car as a car, but as "a treasure entrusted to him by the state."

Also: Zhan Shuijing has not produced a defective product in eleven years; the "Old Ma" of the Shanghai Engine Section can run a million miles non-stop. All of these are impossible without the working class's feeling of "cherishing things."

The health of a child, free from illness and pain, depends on the careful care of the mother or nanny. Su Changfu can be called "loving the car as his son." Look at his ears always listening to the sound of the car parts, is it not like a mother carefully listening to the wheezing in the trachea of a running child?

Our class loves things, but we do not only see things and not people. We love things precisely because these things are the crystallization of human labor. We can see, through steel, paint... etc., the class's blood and sweat condensed on it. Our class not only regards all assets as social material means of subsistence for maintaining life and developing production (of course, we will never have the bourgeois despicable view of regarding assets as a means of exploiting others), but also regards them as the offspring of our class's energy and effort. Touching even a hair of it connects to our hearts. Just like our spirit of sacrificing ourselves for others, we are willing to generously help others with our assets, but we are heartbroken and opposed to the slightest bit of unnecessary waste. Those who waste natural resources have always been parasites and exploiters.

Every member of the working class loves their class brothers and sisters, and hates exploiters. Therefore, every member of the working class also loves every bit of the fruits of labor, and hates and opposes those who waste the fruits of labor. Those who do not cherish state property and the fruits of labor are not generous, but are really lacking in the feelings of the working class and also the working people.

    爱人和爱物
    阮欣
    我们每每说到工人阶级的感情是人类感情中最崇高最可贵的感情时，这常常指的是工人阶级对人，即对自己的阶级兄弟，对一切劳动人民的感情。就拿眼前的几件小事说一说吧：前门饭店的服务员田玉林，每天要把陈国霞同志从房间里背到汽车上，开会回来再把她从汽车上背到房间里。当我们看到为了抢救国家财产而烧坏了一条腿的陈国霞从小汽车门里出来，紧紧爬伏在田玉林同志的背上，双手扣着他的前胸，两条辫子垂在臂膊两旁，脸上露着稚气的笑容，而田玉林同志，微俯着身躯，脸上带着笑容，用手紧紧地挽牢她的两腿，平稳地向饭店大楼的楼梯走去的时候（人民日报11月1日三版登有这样一张照片），我们怎能不觉得这样的感情，比一母同胞的亲兄妹还要胜过几倍！
    老汽车司机虞聚富，把自己最心爱的一套古老的茶具从家里带到车上，用它沏上热茶给他接送的“群英会”代表们喝。这种对于阶级兄弟们的热爱，岂不又超过一个普通的父亲？
    青海省代表团代表孙广基赞美前门饭店的服务员们说：“待人情深好似那青海湖”。这又是阶级感情的交互映射。
    田玉林、虞聚富，都是我们这个阶级的普通成员，他们并不是最杰出的代表，那些“情深似湖”的服务员们，至今连姓名，还不为广大的读者所知。这正好说明，这些使人动情的事只不过是工人阶级感情的最平常、最普遍、最自然的表现。
    工人阶级对自己的阶级兄弟，对一切劳动人民是如此热爱，那末，对于物，具体些说是对于一切国家和公共的财产，以及一切劳动人民的劳动果实的感情又是怎样的呢？其热爱也不亚于爱人。
    前边提到的那位陈国霞，不就是为了抢救国家财产而献出了自己的一条腿，而另一个出席群英会的代表徐学惠，不就又是一个用生命捍卫国家财产的英雄。至于广东的向秀丽，以及一切向秀丽式的英雄们，他们热爱国家财产的高度牺牲精神，撼日月而昭天地，更是为人人所深知。如果说，以上这些，都是工人阶级的爱物精神，在国家财产遭受严重威胁时的突出表现，因而能够深深的激动人心；那末，工人阶级爱物精神，在日常的一般的表现，也是使人十分动情的。
    在群英会的代表里就有这样一个爱物的人，叫苏长福。苏长福是一个普普通通的汽车司机，但又是新疆军区生产建设兵团的特级劳动模范，他还获得了一个优秀党员的光荣称号。这个同志，从1951年7月26日开始驾驶一部苏联吉斯一五○型货车，至今八年多，全车连一个小螺丝也不曾短少。不用说不曾发生过翻车和伤亡事故，而且车子从来没有在中途抛过锚。就是这个苏长福，行车五十万公里还没有大修过车子，按照一般情况，这个期间，需要大修十次。
    在这里，无需全面介绍他的模范事迹，但要看一看他对车子的爱护和感情。“他的两耳随时都在注意机件的响声，一遇音障，不论是在戈壁滩上，还是在冰雪地上，他都不厌其烦地停车，爬在车下检查，哪怕是一个螺丝松了也要拧紧再走。……他在空车行驶时，用绳子将车箱与大梁捆紧，防止车箱震动，在重车停下时，用木棒将车子后部顶起。”（摘自10月8日工人日报）他把车子并不看作车子，而是看作“国家交给的一个宝贝”。
    还有：詹水晶十一年不出废品；上海机务段的“老马”能长驰百万里，离开了工人阶级的这种“爱物”感情，都是不可能作到的。
    一个孩子的健康，不生病痛，要依靠母亲或阿姨的细心照料，苏长福可以称得起“爱车如子”，你看他两耳时时倾听车子机件的音响，岂不正像母亲细心察听奔跑过的孩子气管里的喘音。
    我们的阶级爱物，但并不是见物不见人。我们爱物，正是因为这物是人的劳动的结晶，我们能透过钢铁、油漆……等等，看到凝结在它上面的阶级的血汗。我们阶级，不仅把一切资财看作是维持生命和发展生产的社会物质生活资料（当然，我们就根本不会有资产阶级那种把资财看作剥削别人的手段的卑鄙看法），而且把它们看作是我们阶级的精力和心血化成的产儿。触动他一毛一发，都连着我们的心。正像我们的舍己为人的精神一样，我们愿意把我们的资财慨然相助别人，但是，我们却痛心和反对一丝一毫的无谓抛洒和浪费。暴殄天物的从来都是那些寄生者和剥削者。
    每一个工人阶级的成员，都热爱自己的阶级兄弟，憎恨剥削者，因此，每一个工人阶级的成员也都热爱一点一滴劳动果实，而憎恨和反对那些浪费劳动果实的人。不爱惜国家资财和劳动果实的人，并非大方，实在是缺乏工人阶级的也是缺乏劳动人民的感情。
