A Wholehearted Service for Travelers
——Introducing the Zhongdong Inn of Jinan, Shandong Province

The Zhongdong Inn of Jinan, Shandong Province, was converted from a private freight yard at the end of 1954 and became a joint public-private enterprise in 1956. Over the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, the political consciousness of the staff has been continuously improved, and the service work has become more and more meticulous. It has been repeatedly praised and rewarded by the leadership and is known by travelers as a "home for travelers."

The service staff of this inn were all transferred from agency stores. Due to the deep influence of the old society, at the beginning of their work in the inn, they generally believed that there was no future in this line of work, and it was not glorious, "A good man is not worth doing it, and a lazy man can't do it." Some felt that being called around all day was too demeaning. Therefore, they were not at ease in their work, and their service attitude was cold and rigid. Travelers criticized them as "warm on the outside and cold on the inside."

In 1955, a group of revolutionary disabled soldiers lived in this inn. The inn's leadership often invited them to tell the service staff stories of battle. Wang Qiang, the captain of the "Railway Guerrilla," and Mu Sirong, the battalion commander in "Reconnaissance Across the River," both stayed at this inn on official business. The inn's leadership seized these rare opportunities to invite them to tell revolutionary stories. The service staff was very moved after listening, and some said in the discussions, "What are people risking their lives and shedding blood for the revolutionary cause for?" Some said, "People are not afraid of sacrifice in the revolution, can't we be good service staff?" Through such education, everyone's political and ideological awareness was gradually improved.

At the beginning of 1956, the inn was converted into a joint public-private enterprise. After the joint venture, the Party strengthened its political and business leadership even more, and batches of inn employees were transferred to commercial cadre schools to study, helping them establish and improve learning and meeting systems; it often held forums, using the method of recalling the past and comparing it with the present to enlighten and educate everyone, so that everyone's ideological awareness was further improved. At this time, a comrade from the Jixi City Service Bureau of Northeast China came and introduced a service worker from the Fifth Hotel in Jixi City. This service worker was originally a platoon leader in the army. Because of his outstanding service work, he was named an advanced worker and attended the National Congress of Advanced Producers' Representatives. This event was a great inspiration to everyone, and further established their sense of honor in service work. With the ideological problems solved, the comrades' enthusiasm for work was brought into play.

The most concerning issues for travelers staying in the inn are whether they can find comfortable rooms and timely meals. The inn's service staff always meets their different requirements according to different travelers. For example, for travelers coming to attend meetings, with consistent routines, they are arranged to stay in large rooms to facilitate the exchange of opinions and discussions; for travelers with children, worried that their children might run onto the road, they are arranged to stay in rooms in the back courtyard far from the street; patients who are suffering from illnesses and are easily irritable are arranged to stay in quiet, clean, and sunny rooms; purchasers who have a lot of external contacts and often make phone calls are arranged to stay in rooms close to the business office; ethnic minorities whose living customs are different from those of the Han Chinese are given separate rooms. Although the conditions of the rooms are not very good, the travelers are very satisfied with this arrangement. Some travelers wrote on big-character posters: "The house is not big, clean and elegant, it is both an inn and my home." The Shanxi Taiyuan Health Visiting Group wrote on a big-character poster: "Politics takes command and the enthusiasm is really great, the service attitude is warm and commendable, the rooms are clean and bright, worthy of being called a home for travelers."

Before 1958, this inn did not have a traveler's canteen. After the travelers checked in, they were busy finding a place to eat, which delayed many things. Especially the guests who arrived at night, after the restaurants closed, they could not get anything to eat. For travelers who arrived at night without having eaten, the service staff would give their own night meal to the travelers when they found out. However, this could only take care of one or two people, and it was okay for a day or two, but not often. Since the Great Leap Forward, travelers have been coming and going frequently, and work is being done day and night, so the need to solve the canteen problem has become even more urgent. With the strong support and help of the leadership, they overcame all kinds of difficulties, and a canteen that could provide meals for 380 people was built on the "May 1st" holiday in 1958. After the canteen was built, the problem of eating for travelers staying in this inn was solved. Someone suggested that guests from nearby inns should also come to eat, but some people found it troublesome and disagreed. After discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that serving travelers should not distinguish between your inn and our inn. Now, travelers from seven inns are eating in the Zhongdong Inn's canteen.

When travelers are away from home, they will inevitably encounter some difficulties in their work or life. As the traveler's temporary home, the inn has a responsibility to help solve them as much as possible. This inn often houses many staff members from state organs, industrial and mining enterprises, who often need to make long-distance phone calls due to work needs; after the phone calls are finished, they have to settle accounts and pay at the post office. In order to reduce the trouble for travelers, the inn has established an accounting and payment relationship with the post office, handling accounting and payment procedures for travelers; for commercial workers who come to purchase goods, they take the initiative to introduce Shandong's local specialties, such as Zhangqiu scallions, Laiwu flax, Yantai apples, Laiyang pears, Jiaozhou cabbage, and Feicheng peaches, etc.; for passers-by who do not have work tasks, they introduce Jinan's scenic spots and historical sites, such as Daming Lake, Baotu Spring, and Thousand Buddha Mountain, etc., so that guests can visit them. As for helping travelers borrow cloth tickets and food stamps, and finding lost items, it is also taken as a task to complete. In order to solve the problems encountered by travelers in the details of life, they have also launched small service activities, such as washing and mending clothes and socks for guests, coloring and oiling leather shoes, brushing rain shoes and sneakers, mending sweaters, seeing a doctor and registering, decocting medicine for guests, writing letters for guests, renting out books and magazines, etc. Now there are twenty-seven service items. From February to July this year, they washed and mended more than 1,500 pieces of clothing for guests. Since the launch of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the staff has been even more motivated, and they have done 1,100 pieces in August alone.

The old society's hotels were "not keeping disabled patients, not keeping women with children, and not keeping single men with luggage." They believed that these people would be extra troublesome to stay in the hotel, taking a lot of effort and not making much money. This inn, like many inns after liberation, no longer has the "three no's" phenomenon, and they even take extra care when these travelers come to stay. They realize that being a good service worker is not just about sweeping the floor, delivering water, wiping tables, and running errands, but also about being good at understanding the traveler's feelings and trying to make the traveler feel happy. Once, a young technician from a geological exploration team had his leg crushed by a drilling machine and was sent to Jinan for treatment, staying at the Zhongdong Inn. This comrade was newly married and was afraid of his lover finding out, so he was very distressed. In addition to patiently taking care of his life, the service staff also took him to see movies and plays, but this still did not eliminate his pain. The service staff realized that he had lost confidence in his personal future. In order to help him solve his ideological problems, they bought the Soviet novels "The Legless Flying General" and "How the Steel Was Tempered" for him to read, and also invited a revolutionary disabled soldier with an artificial leg who was also staying at the inn at the time to help him. Through the efforts of all parties, he finally strengthened his confidence and turned his sorrow into joy. He was very grateful to the service staff for their care. He became a close friend with the service staff and still communicates with them frequently. One day, the Heilongtan Sanatorium in Taian sent a patient who, due to his serious illness, defecated in his pants. The service worker Jin Zibin took a bedpan and helped the patient defecate without waiting for the nurse to speak, and washed his soiled pants, which moved the patient greatly, and even the nurse was very moved. Another time, a pregnant woman came from the Northeast. When she arrived at the inn, it was already midnight, and she was about to give birth before she could settle down. It was too late to send her to the hospital. How could she give birth without anyone to take care of her? The service staff were all men, which was both inconvenient and inexperienced. They mobilized a female guest to help, so that the woman safely gave birth to a fat baby. The service staff prepared chicken, noodles, and porridge, and tried their best to make her feel warm and intimate. Late at night in December last year, a comrade from the Pingyin County Cultural Center brought his lover to Jinan for treatment. At that time, the inn was full, so the service worker Wang Jiaoshan let them rest on the sofa in the service room, and took off his coat to cover the patient. They said movedly, "You are really serving customers with all your heart, leaving all kinds of difficulties to yourselves."

They are even more considerate to travelers with less travel experience. In addition to introducing some common sense of going out, such as paying attention to keeping things safe and paying attention to traffic safety, they also write a note for each trip, indicating the round-trip route, so that if they get lost, they can return by asking for directions according to the written note.

The reason why this inn has been able to meet the diverse needs of travelers over the past few years is not based on flaunting wealth and showing off extravagance, but on implementing the principle of running enterprises diligently and thriftily. Facts have proved that doing so not only meets the needs of travelers, but also inspires the enthusiasm of employees. For example, in running the canteen, they learned from the experience of many industrial and mining enterprises starting factories from scratch, doing it themselves, and asking for guidance if they didn't understand the technology; without raw materials, they collected them everywhere. They didn't hire a single worker, and after more than 20 days of hard work, a canteen that could provide meals for 380 people was built, saving the state more than 1,300 yuan in construction costs alone. Over the past few years, the inn has adjusted beds, repaired houses, and painted walls, and has never hired outsiders, but has done it all by the service staff themselves in their spare time. Because the service staff is skilled in business and has become multi-faceted, although a canteen has been added and many new service items have been launched, the number of staff has not increased. Paying attention to saving every bit at any time has become a part of their service activities. They collect and process the discarded orange peels, toothpaste skins, broken shoes, can tubes, wine bottles, and other waste items. The newspapers, playing cards, and toilet paper used by the inn for travelers to read and play are bought with this money.

Now, many service workers in this inn have become six members (service worker, hygienist, administrator, bookkeeper, propagandist, and caregiver), and the entire service work is also developing in a more comprehensive direction. Because they enthusiastically serve travelers, in less than a year, they have received 19 award banners from Party and government organs at the provincial, city, and district levels, and travelers have given them 23 brocade banners and mirrors, more than 1,460 written praises, and more than 440 big-character poster praises. Liu Xintian of the Huantai County Department Store wrote a allegro song praising them: "Several times traveling to Jinan and staying in Zhongdong, I am grateful in my heart, first, I feel the service attitude is good, second, I feel the care is really thoughtful, third, I feel that hygiene is emphasized everywhere..." The honorary title of "Home for Travelers" has replaced the criticism of "warm on the outside and cold on the inside."

    一片赤心为旅客
    ——介绍山东省济南市中东旅社
    山东省济南市中东旅社是1954年年底由一个私营货栈转业建成的，1956年转为公私合营。几年来，在党的领导下，职工的政治觉悟不断提高，服务工作愈做愈细致，曾多次受到领导上的表扬、奖励，被旅客誉为“旅客之家”。
    这个旅社的服务员都是从代理店转来的，由于受旧社会的影响较深，参加旅社工作初期，较普遍地认为干这一行没有前途，不光荣，“好汉子不值得干、癞汉子干不了”。有的觉得整天被人呼来唤去，太失身份。因此在工作上不安心，服务态度冷淡生硬，旅客批评他们是“外暖内凉”。
    1955年有一批革命残废军人住在这个旅社里，旅社领导就经常请他们给服务员们讲战斗故事。“铁道游击队”队长王强和“渡江侦察记”里的营长牟思荣都因公在这个旅社住过，旅社领导就抓住这些难得的机会请他们讲革命故事。服务员们听了以后很受感动，有的在座谈中说：“人家为革命事业拼命流血为的什么？”有的说：“人家闹革命不怕牺牲，我们就不能当好一个服务员吗？”通过这样一些教育，逐渐提高了大家的政治思想觉悟。
    1956年初，旅社转为公私合营。合营后，党对他们的政治领导和业务领导更加强了，分批抽调旅社职工到商业干部学校学习，帮助他们建立、健全学习和会议制度；经常召开座谈会，用回忆对比的方法启发教育大家，使大家的思想觉悟更进一步提高了。正在这个时候，东北鸡西市服务局来了一位同志，他向大家介绍了鸡西市第五旅馆的一个服务员。这位服务员原是部队的排长，因为服务员工作做得出色，被评为先进工作者，出席了全国先进生产者代表会议。这件事情对大家的启发教育很大，使大家进一步树立了服务工作的光荣感。思想问题解决了，同志们的工作积极性都发挥出来了。
    旅客住旅社，最关心的问题是能不能住上舒适的房子和及时吃上饭。旅社服务员总是根据不同旅客来满足他们的不同要求。如开会来的旅客，生活规律一致，就让他们住大房间，便于随时交换意见和开会讨论；携带小孩的旅客，担心孩子跑到马路上，就让他们住后院离街远的房间；病号因疾病痛苦，容易烦燥，住安静、清洁、阳光充足的房间；采购员对外联系多，常有电话，住离营业室近的房间；少数民族生活风俗习惯与汉族不同，单设房间。这样安排房间，虽然房子条件不怎么好，但旅客都很满意。有的旅客在大字报上写道：“房子不大，清洁幽雅，既是旅社，又是我家。”山西省太原市卫生参观团的大字报写着：“政治挂帅干劲真大，服务态度热情可夸，房间内外清洁畅亮，不愧称为旅客之家。”
    1958年以前，这个旅社没有旅客食堂。旅客住下后，忙于找地方吃饭，耽搁很多事情。特别是晚上来的客人，饭馆下了班就吃不上饭。对于晚上到来没有吃饭的旅客，服务员知道了，就把自己的夜餐让给旅客吃。但是，这样做，只能照顾一个两个人，而且一天两天行，经常也不行。大跃进以来，旅客往来频繁，工作不分昼夜，解决食堂问题就更迫切了。在领导上大力支持帮助下，他们克服了种种困难，一座能供给三百八十人吃饭的食堂在1958年“五一”节建成了。食堂建成后，在这个旅社住的旅客吃饭问题解决了。有人提议也让附近旅社的客人同来就餐，有的人嫌麻烦不同意。经过讨论，大家一致认为为旅客服务不能分你社我社。现在，已有七个旅社的旅客都在中东旅社食堂吃饭了。
    旅客出门在外，工作上或生活上不可避免地会遇到一些困难。作为旅客临时家庭的旅社，有责任尽量帮助解决。这个旅社经常住着许多国家机关、工矿企业的工作人员，因工作需要经常要挂长途电话；电话讲完，就得向邮电局算账交款。为了减少旅客的麻烦，旅社和邮电局建立了记账交款关系，替旅客办理记账交款手续；对前来采购货物的商业工作人员，他们就主动给介绍山东土特名产，如章丘大葱、莱芜麻、烟台苹果、莱阳梨、胶州白菜、肥城桃等等；对没有工作任务的过路客人，就介绍济南的名胜古迹，如大明湖、趵突泉、千佛山等，以便于客人游览。至于平时帮助旅客筹借布票、粮票，寻找丢失的东西，也是当作一项任务去完成。为了解决旅客在生活细节中遇到的问题，他们还开展了小服务活动，如代客拆洗和缝补衣袜、皮鞋上色擦油、刷洗雨鞋球鞋、织补毛衣、看病挂号、代客煎药、代写书信、出租书刊等，现在服务项目已有二十七个。从今年2到7月份，就即代客拆洗、缝补衣物一千五百多件次。自开展增产节约运动后，职工们干劲更大了，仅8月份就做了一千一百件次。
    旧社会的旅店是“一不留残废病人，二不留带小孩的妇女，三不留带行李的单身汉”。认为这些人来住旅社，格外增加麻烦，出力不少，赚钱不多。这个旅社跟解放后的许多旅社一样，“三不留”的现象是没有了，而且遇到这些旅客来住，还要格外照顾。他们认识到，做一个好服务员，不光是扫地、送水、抹抹桌子跑跑腿，还必须善于体察旅客的心情，尽量使旅客精神愉快。有一次，一个地质勘探队的青年技术工人被钻机轧伤了一条腿，送到济南来治疗，住在中东旅社。这个同志刚结婚不久，怕被爱人知道，精神非常痛苦。服务员除耐心地照顾他的生活以外，还背他去看电影，看戏，但这样还是消除不了他的痛苦。服务员们看出他是对个人前途失去了信心。为了帮助他解决思想问题，他们买来苏联小说“无脚飞将军”和“钢铁是怎样炼成的”给他看，又请当时也住在旅社的一位装着假腿的革命残废军人来帮助他。经过各方面的努力，终于使他坚定了信心，转忧为喜。他非常感谢服务员对他的关怀。跟服务员成了知心朋友，直到现在还经常通信。一天，泰山黑龙潭疗养院送来一位病员，因病势严重，大便便在裤子里，服务员晋子彬没等护士开口，便拿来便盆，扶着那位病员大便，并把他的屎裤子洗净，使病员极为感动，连那位护士也非常感动。又一次，从东北来了一位孕妇，到达旅社已是半夜，没等安置好就要分娩，送医院已经来不及了。分娩时没人照顾怎么能行呢？服务员都是男同志，既不方便，也没经验。他们便动员一位女客人来帮助，使产妇安全地生了个白胖娃娃。服务员准备了鸡子、挂面、稀饭，尽力使她感到亲切温暖。去年12月深夜，平阴县文化馆有位同志带着爱人来济南治病，当时旅社已客满，服务员王教善便把他们让到服务室沙发上休息，并把自己的大衣脱下来给病人盖好。他们感动地说：“你们真是一片赤心为顾客，万般困难留自己。”
    对旅行经验少的旅客，他们更是格外体贴。他们除介绍一些出门的常识，如注意保管东西、注意交通安全以外，每逢出去还给开上条子，注明来回路线，以防一旦迷了路，可照着写的条子问明路线返回。
    这个旅社几年来能够满足旅客多方面的要求，并不是在摆阔气、讲排场的基础上做到的，而是贯彻了勤俭办企业的原则。事实证明，这样做不但满足了旅客的要求，而且激发了职工的干劲。比如办食堂，他们就是学习了许多工矿企业白手起家办工厂的经验，自己动手，不懂技术，请人作指导；没有原材料，各处去搜集。他们没找一个工人，经过二十多天的紧张劳动，一所能供给三百八十人吃饭的食堂就建成了，为国家节约仅修建费一千三百多元。几年来，旅社内调整床位、修理房子、粉刷墙壁，从来没有雇用过外人，都是服务员挤时间自己动手来做。由于服务员业务熟练，成了多面手，虽然增加了一个食堂，开展了很多新的服务项目，但人员并没有增加。随时注意点滴节约已成为他们服务活动的一项内容。旅客扔掉的橘子皮、牙膏皮、破鞋、罐头筒、酒瓶子等废旧物品，他们都搜集起来变价处理。旅社供旅客阅读的报纸，玩的朴克，用的草纸，就是用这些钱买的。
    现在这个旅社的许多服务员已经成为六员（服务员、卫生员、管理员、记账员、宣传员、护理员），整个服务工作也向着更全面的方向发展。因为他们热心为旅客服务，不到一年时间，就获得省、市区各级党政机关的奖旗十九面，旅客赠送的锦旗礼镜就有二十三面，书面表扬一千四百六十多次，大字报表扬四百四十多张。桓台县百货公司刘心田编写了一首快板这样表扬他们：“几次旅济住中东，使我感激在心中，一感服务态度好，二感照顾真周到，三感处处讲卫生……”。“旅客之家”的荣誉称号代替了“外暖内凉”的批评。
