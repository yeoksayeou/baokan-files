Xinhua News Agency, November 24th dispatch from Leopoldville: Three African political parties in the Belgian Congo issued a memorandum on the 23rd, demanding immediate independence for the Congo and calling on the Congolese people to unite in the struggle to achieve this goal.

The three parties are ABAKO, the Kasavubu faction of the Congolese National Movement, and the African Solidarity Party. This memorandum was published the day before the Belgian Minister for Congolese and Ruanda-Urundi Affairs, De Schrijver, arrived in the Congo to begin his activities of "consulting with local leaders."

In the memorandum, the three African political parties announced their plan for the independence of the Congo. The plan proposes that the current six provinces of the Congo form a federal state, with each member of the federation having an executive body, an elected parliament, and a government. This federal state would be managed by a central federal government.

The memorandum demands that the Congolese people participate in drafting any plans regarding the future of the Belgian Congo.

The memorandum condemns the "security force's" suppression of the Congolese people by the Belgian Congo colonial authorities and accuses the Belgian government of transporting large numbers of Belgian colonial troops to the Congo to intensify the suppression of the Congolese people striving for independence.

This newspaper reports that the Congolese people are continuously fighting back against the Belgian colonial authorities' military suppression and political division conspiracies, loudly demanding immediate independence, and adhering to the just struggle against colonialism.

As the date of the deceptive "elections" arranged by the Belgian colonial authorities draws nearer, the struggle of the Congolese people against colonial rule has become even more active. On the 22nd, the Belgian Minister for Congolese and Ruanda-Urundi Affairs arrived in Leopoldville to further arrange for the deceptive "election" activities to be carried out next month. The broad masses of the Congolese people are gathering strength under the slogan of resisting the deceptive elections and demanding immediate independence, preparing to give the Belgian colonialists an even more resolute blow.

The upcoming deceptive "elections" were proposed by the Belgian authorities on October 16th. According to the plan of the Belgian colonial authorities, the Congo will hold so-called territorial and municipal council "elections" in December of this year, establish provincial councils in March of next year, and then establish a Senate and House of Representatives between August and September, but all power will be in the hands of the Belgian Governor-General, and the Congo will only obtain nominal "independence" under the principle of "union" with Belgium until 1964.

After Belgium published this deceptive "phased independence" plan, it was resolutely opposed by the Congolese people. The main Congolese nationalist parties, the Congolese National Movement, ABAKO, and the African Solidarity Party, successively issued statements refusing the deceptive Belgian plan and resisting the so-called "elections" scheduled for December. At the end of October, the Congress of the Congolese National Movement more clearly put forward the demand to immediately declare the independence of the Congo and postpone the elections. At the same time, the Congolese National Movement, the Kivu Province African Solidarity Center, the Ruanda National Alliance, the Leopoldville People's Party, and several other political parties held a joint representative meeting to discuss issues such as resisting the deceptive "elections" and organizing a provisional Congolese government. At the same time, mass struggles against colonial rule broke out in areas such as Luluabourg and Stanleyville.

The Belgian authorities brazenly rejected the just demands of the Congolese people. A large number of Belgian troops were transferred to the Congo to intensify suppression activities and arrested Congolese National Movement leader Lumumba and others. On November 5th, the Belgian Parliament passed the government's current policy of enslaving the Congo. The Belgian Minister for Congolese and Ruanda-Urundi Affairs, De Schrijver, also stated that he would personally go to the Congo to intensify political division and armed suppression activities, implement his so-called "phased independence" plan, and insist on holding the deceptive "elections" next month.

The Congolese people resolutely fought back against the Belgian authorities. On November 9th, the Congolese National Movement sent a telegram to Belgian King Baudouin and Belgian political leaders, accusing the colonial authorities of the bloody suppression incident in Stanleyville. The Congolese National Movement also demanded that the Belgian authorities immediately release its leader Lumumba, otherwise it would refuse to hold negotiations with the Belgian government on the Congo issue. The Congolese ABAKO and the African Solidarity Party also sent telegrams protesting the colonial authorities' crime of arresting Lumumba.

Many Western newspapers, in reports on recent developments in the Congo situation, revealed the Belgian colonial authorities' outwardly fierce but inwardly weak nature and the fears of other colonial countries. Michael McAl, a reporter for the British "Daily Express," wrote in a report from Stanleyville that the Congolese people were "rushing towards the most precious wealth in Africa today - independence," which "means that the glittering colonial dream is about to end." Most Belgian colonists in the Congo feel "annoyed and scared" by the development of the situation. The British "Daily Telegraph" wrote: No one can be sure what consequences the Congolese people's struggle will produce. If the Congo achieves independence, it will have "incalculable influence on the entire British and French Africa." Agence France-Presse reporter Raymond Huber admitted that the Congolese people's struggle has placed Belgian colonial rule "frequently in crisis."

    刚果人民要求立即独立
    三大非洲人政党号召加强团结斗争到底
    坚决反对比利时殖民当局的“分阶段独立”计划
    新华社24日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：比属刚果三个非洲人政党在23日发表一项备忘录，要求刚果立即独立，并且号召刚果人民在争取达到这个目的的斗争中团结一致。
    这三个政党是阿巴科党、刚果民族运动党卡隆基派和非洲团结党。在这个备忘录发表的前一天，比利时刚果和卢安达—乌隆迪事务大臣德舒里弗到达刚果开始他的“同当地领袖会谈”的活动。
    这三个非洲人政党在备忘录中宣布了它们关于刚果的独立计划。这个计划建议由刚果目前的六个省组成一个联邦国家，联邦的每个成员都有一个执行机构，一个经过选举产生的议会和一个政府。这个联邦国家将由一个中央联邦政府管理。
    备忘录要求让刚果人民参加起草关于比属刚果的未来的任何计划。
    备忘录谴责比属刚果殖民当局的“保安队”对刚果人民的镇压行为，并且指责比利时政府增运大批比利时殖民军队到刚果去加紧镇压争取独立的刚果人民。
    本报讯　刚果人民不断反击比利时殖民当局的军事镇压和政治分化阴谋，响亮地要求立即独立，坚持反殖民主义的正义斗争。
    随着比利时殖民当局所安排的欺骗“选举”日期日益临近，刚果人民反对殖民统治的斗争也更加活跃起来。22日，比利时的刚果和卢安达—乌隆迪事务大臣到达利奥波德维尔，进一步安排下月进行欺骗性“选举”活动。而广大刚果人民正在抵制欺骗性选举和要求立即独立的口号下集结力量，准备给予比利时殖民者更坚决的打击。
    即将进行的欺骗性“选举”是比利时当局在10月16日提出的。根据比利时殖民当局的计划，今年12月刚果将举行所谓领地和市镇议会“选举”，明年3月成立省议会，8、9月间再成立参众两院，但是一切大权都操在比利时总督之手，直到1964年刚果才能在和比利时“联合”的原则下得到名义上的“独立”。
    比利时这个所谓“分阶段独立”的欺骗性计划发表以后，即遭到刚果人民的坚决反对。刚果的主要民族主义政党民族运动党、阿巴科党、非洲团结党都先后发表声明，拒绝比利时欺骗性计划，抵制预订在12月间举行的所谓“选举”。10月底，刚果民族运动党代表大会更明确提出立即宣布刚果独立、延期举行选举的要求。同时，刚果民族运动党、基伍省非洲团结中心、卢安达全国联盟、利奥波德维尔人民党等几个政党举行了联席代表会议，就抵制欺骗性“选举”和组织刚果临时政府等问题进行了讨论。与此同时，路路阿堡和斯坦利维尔等地区爆发了群众性的反对殖民统治的斗争。
    比利时当局悍然拒绝了刚果人民的正义要求。大批比利时军队调往刚果，加紧镇压活动，并且逮捕了刚果民族运动党领导人卢蒙巴等人。11月5日，比利时议会通过了政府的现行奴役刚果的政策。比利时的刚果和卢安达—乌隆迪事务大臣德舒里弗并表示要亲自前往刚果，加紧进行政治分化和武装镇压活动，贯彻他所谓的“分阶段独立”方案，坚持要在下月举行欺骗性的“选举”。
    刚果人民对比利时当局进行了坚决回击。11月9日，刚果民族运动党打电报给比利时国王博杜安和比利时政界领袖，指责殖民当局在斯坦利维尔的血腥镇压事件。刚果民族运动党并要求比利时当局立即释放该党领袖卢蒙巴，否则就拒绝同比利时政府举行关于刚果问题的谈判。刚果的阿巴科党和非洲团结党也打电报抗议殖民当局逮捕卢蒙巴的罪行。
    许多西方报刊在有关最近刚果局势发展的报道中，透露了比利时殖民当局的色厉内荏和其他殖民国家的恐惧。英国的“每日快报”记者麦科尔从斯坦利维尔发回的报道中写道：刚果人民正在“冲向今天非洲所最宝贵的财富——独立”，这“意味着闪闪发光的殖民梦想即将结束”。大部分在刚果的比利时殖民者对形势发展感到“烦恼和害怕”。英国的“每日电讯报”写道：谁也不敢肯定刚果人民的斗争会产生怎样的后果。如果刚果实现独立，对“整个英属和法属非洲将产生无法估计的影响”。法新社记者雷蒙·雨伯承认，刚果人民的斗争，已使比利时的殖民统治“经常处在危机中”。（附图片）
