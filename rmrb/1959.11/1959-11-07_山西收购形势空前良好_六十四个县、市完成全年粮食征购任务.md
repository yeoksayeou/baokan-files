According to Shanxi Daily, the situation on the agricultural and sideline product procurement front in Shanxi Province is unprecedentedly good. A new procurement competition upsurge is sweeping the province, with particularly outstanding achievements in the October procurement campaign. By October 31, sixty-four counties and cities across the province had completed or exceeded their annual grain procurement tasks, and other counties and cities were also close to completion.

Cotton procurement has also completed the October task ahead of schedule, building on the early completion of the September task. Since the new cotton came on the market, the province has purchased 99,850,000 jin of cotton, an increase of 9.89 times over the same period last year. Yicheng and Yangcheng counties have completed their annual cotton procurement tasks.

Oilseed procurement has resulted in 16,840,000 jin of oil already in storage, an increase of 5.8 times over the same period last year. Zuoyun, Wuzhai, Xiyang, Lüliang, Puxian, and Anze counties have completed or exceeded their annual small oilseed procurement tasks.

The procurement progress of other agricultural and sideline products is also very rapid. According to statistics, Xiyang, Yushe, Pingshun, Wuxiang, Qin County, Yuanping, Shouyang, and Zuoyun counties have completed or exceeded the total value of their annual agricultural and sideline product procurement tasks.

This year, the characteristics of agricultural and sideline product procurement are a comprehensive Great Leap Forward: simultaneously grasping quantity and quality, and integrating procurement, processing, and transportation into a "one-dragon" system. Currently, in addition to grain procurement being close to completion, the procurement of other agricultural and sideline products is also proceeding at high speed and with high quality. Since October, the average daily intake of live pigs has increased by 11.76% compared to the same period last year, fresh eggs by 65.8%, and hemp by 5%. Various localities have adopted the "one-dragon" approach of procurement, processing, and transportation, ensuring that the processing and transportation tasks of agricultural and sideline products also win simultaneously with the procurement tasks. The quality of agricultural and sideline products already in storage generally meets national standards. Most of the grain is dry, clean, and full, with few impurities, low moisture content, and meets national requirements. The quality of cotton is particularly good, with the vast majority being grade four or above, an average improvement of one to two grades compared to last year. The meat yield of live pigs has also greatly increased.

The agricultural and sideline product procurement campaign in Shanxi Province was launched under the inspiration of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Zuoyun County, which first launched a high-speed, high-quality grain sales campaign, was the first to complete its annual grain procurement task. Subsequently, a wave of learning from Zuoyun, catching up with Zuoyun, and surpassing Zuoyun on horseback emerged throughout the province. Guangling, Shanyin, Hunyuan, Yuci, and Taigu counties and cities quickly caught up, launched surprise threshing and grain drying campaigns, and completed their annual grain procurement tasks in a few days.

In the competition movement, many places have also promoted the new ethos of mutual cooperation and joint completion of plans. After completing the autumn grain storage task, Zuoyun County immediately dispatched 150 carts, more than 500 laborers, and more than 200 head of livestock to support farmers in Shanyin County in threshing, drying, and transporting grain. Many communes and management districts helped each other and supported each other, greatly advancing the completion of delivery tasks.

    山西收购形势空前良好
    六十四个县、市完成全年粮食征购任务
    据山西日报消息　山西省农副产品收购战线上形势空前良好，一个新的收购竞赛热潮正席卷全省，特别是10月份的收购运动，成绩更为突出。到10月31日为止，全省已经有六十四个县、市完成或超额完成了全年粮食征购任务，其它县、市也接近完成。
    棉花收购，在提前完成了9月份任务的基础上，又提前完成了10月份的任务。从新棉上市到现在，全省已收购棉花九千九百八十五万斤，比去年同期收购数增加了九点八九倍。翼城和阳城两县已经完成了全年棉花收购任务。
    油料收购，已经入库油脂一千六百八十四万斤，比去年同期收购数增加了五点八倍。左云、五寨、昔阳、吕梁、蒲县、安泽等六县已经完成或超额完成了全年小油料的收购任务。
    其它农副产品收购进度也很迅速。据统计，已经完成或超额完成全年农副产品收购任务总值的，有昔阳、榆社、平顺、武乡、沁县、原平、寿阳、左云等八县。
    今年，农副产品收购的特点，是全面大跃进：数量、质量一齐抓，收购、加工、调运“一条龙”。目前，除粮食征购已经接近完成任务以外，其它农副产品的收购，也同样是高速度、高质量。10月份以来，生猪平均日收量比去年同期提高11.76％，鲜蛋提高65.8％，大麻提高5％。各地采取收购、加工、调运“一条龙”的办法，使农副产品的加工、调运任务也和收购任务同时获胜。在已入库的农副产品中，质量一般都达到国家要求标准。粮食绝大部分都是干、净、饱，杂质少，水分低，合乎国家要求。棉花质量特别好，四级以上的棉花占到绝大多数，比去年平均提高了一到两个等级。生猪的出肉率也大大提高。
    山西省农副产品收购运动，是在党的八中全会精神鼓舞下开展起来的。首先掀起高速度、高质量售粮运动的左云县，第一个完成了全年粮食征购任务。随之，一个学左云、赶左云、跨上骏马超左云的热潮即在全省出现。广灵、山阴、浑源、榆次、太谷等县、市急起直追、突击打场、晒粮，几天时间，即完成了全年粮食征购任务。
    竞赛运动中，许多地方还发扬了相互协作，共同完成计划的新风尚。左云县在完成秋粮入库任务后，立即抽出一百五十辆大车，五百多个劳力和二百多头牲口，支援山阴县农民打场、晒粮和运输。许多公社、管理区互相帮助，互相支援，使交售任务大大提前完成。
