Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 22nd. The Chinese Picture Exhibition which opened in Colombo on November 13th closed today.

　　Approximately 50,000 visitors from all over Ceylon attended the exhibition. Some schools organized group visits for their students, and the teachers accompanying them explained the current situation in China to them.

　　Many visitors wrote in the guestbook that holding this exhibition would help the people of Ceylon further understand the new life of the Chinese people, and thus help further strengthen the friendship between the peoples of the two countries. Another common opinion in the guestbook was that the tremendous achievements of the Chinese people in the past decade have, and will surely, inspire the peace-loving people of Asia and the world in their struggle for national independence and peace.

    科伦坡我国图片展览会闭幕
    锡兰各地有五万观众前去参观
    新华社科伦坡22日电　11月13日在科伦坡开幕的中国图片展览会今天闭幕。
    来自锡兰全国各地的约五万观众参观了这次展览会。有些学校的学生集体参观了展览会，陪同他们参观的老师们向他们讲解了今天的中国的情况。
    许多观众在留言簿上写道，举行这次展览会，有助于锡兰人民对中国人民的新生活的进一步了解，因此也有助于进一步加强两国人民之间的友谊。留言簿上的另一个普遍意见是，中国人民在过去十年中的巨大成就已经、并且肯定将会鼓舞亚洲和全世界爱好和平的人民为争取民族独立和和平而进行的斗争。
