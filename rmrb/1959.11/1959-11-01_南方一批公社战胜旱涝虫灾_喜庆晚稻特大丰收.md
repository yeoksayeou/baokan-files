Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 31st: Shanggao County, Jiangxi Province, has achieved a bumper late rice harvest with a per-mu yield increase of 50% on 191,000 mu.

    After the late rice seedlings were transplanted, Shanggao County experienced both drought and insect infestations. The county Party committee quickly led the masses in launching a field management campaign centered on fighting drought and eliminating insects, vigorously processing and applying fertilizer to upgrade the seedlings. In Tianxin Commune, the area most severely affected by drought, more than 20 waterwheels were connected to transport water over the mountain slopes, and more than 200 springs were dug out one after another, ensuring the normal growth of late rice.

    The soaring enthusiasm of the masses finally overcame the severe drought and major insect infestation of the past ninety days, and victoriously realized the slogan of late rice surpassing early rice.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 31st: The LiuGuang People's Commune in Xiuwen County, Guizhou Province, demonstrated great power and reaped an unprecedented bumper harvest of autumn grain in a year of severe drought. The average per-mu yield of the commune's 70,000 mu of autumn fields was 785 jin, an increase of more than double compared to last year. Among them, 8,250 mu of paddy rice had an average per-mu yield of 1,051 jin, an increase of 60% compared to last year.

    This commune is located in a high and cold mountainous area and has historically been a low-yield grain area. After communization, this situation has changed significantly.

    Under the threat of this year's severe water and drought disasters, the power of the commune's collaborative disaster resistance was very obvious. After the transplanting of the seedlings, 30% of the commune's farmland was scoured by floods. The commune immediately organized more than 10,000 people to rush to rescue and replant. In less than ten days, the fields damaged by the water were repaired, and seedlings were replanted. From July, the commune encountered a continuous drought of more than seventy days, and 80% of the fields were dehydrated and cracked. The commune organized a cooperative anti-drought army of 21,000 people, including workers, peasants, merchants, students and soldiers, to fight the drought demon and save all the drought-stricken fields.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 31st: The Miao Autonomous County of Damiaoshan in the high and cold mountainous areas of Guangxi has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of intermediate rice. As of October 29, 74,000 mu of the county's 90,000 mu of intermediate rice had been harvested. The yield of 41,509 mu has been verified with an average yield of 915 jin of dry rice per mu, an increase of 23% compared to last year's average per-mu yield. The per-mu yield of 250 mu was as high as 1,900 jin.

    The japonica and glutinous rice varieties used in Damiaoshan include more than 100 varieties, such as round-head japonica, round-head glutinous, white japonica, black japonica, and sheep-eye japonica. The common characteristics of these varieties are: long ears, many and neat grains, strong adaptability, drought resistance, fertilizer resistance, and lodging resistance.

    The Luohan People's Commune on the outskirts of Luzhou City, Sichuan Province, overcame the worst drought in more than 20 years, and more than 6,000 mu of late rice achieved a bumper harvest. The per-mu yield of the more than 3,000 mu that have been harvested is generally around 400 jin. This shows commune members harvesting late rice. Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Zhongjing

    南方一批公社战胜旱涝虫灾
    喜庆晚稻特大丰收
    上高县十九万亩晚稻比去年增产50％
    六广公社八千亩水稻平均亩产一千多斤
    大苗山四万亩水稻平均亩产于谷九百多斤
    据新华社南昌31日电　江西上高县十九万一千多亩晚稻亩产比去年增加50％，获得了特大丰收。
    晚稻插秧后不久，上高县曾相继出现干旱和虫害，县委迅速领导群众掀起了一个以抗旱灭虫为中心的田间管理运动高潮，大力加工施肥，使禾苗升级。旱情最为严重的田心公社，用二十多梯水车连接车水过山坡，又先后挖出两百多处泉水，从而保证了晚禾的正常生长。
    群众的冲天干劲，终于战胜了九十天来的严重干旱和特大虫害，胜利地实现了晚稻超早稻的口号。
    据新华社贵阳31日电　贵州修文县六广人民公社发挥巨大威力，在大旱之年夺得秋粮空前大丰收。全社七万亩秋田，平均亩产七百八十五斤，比去年增长一倍多。其中八千二百五十亩水稻，平均亩产一千零五十一斤，比去年增长六成。
    这个公社地处高寒山区，历来是一个粮食低产区。公社化以后，这种情况有很大改变。
    在今年严重的水旱灾害威胁下，公社协作抗灾的威力表现得十分明显。栽秧结束后，全社30％的田土受洪水冲刷。公社立即组织一万多人前往抢救、补栽，不到十天工夫，就把被水冲坏的田修好，重新栽上了秧苗。从7月份开始，全社又遇到持续七十多天的大旱，80％的田脱水龟裂，公社又组织了包括工农商学兵在内的抗旱协作大军二万一千多人，大战旱魔，挽救了全部受旱田地。
    新华社南宁31日电　广西高寒山区的大苗山苗族自治县中稻大面积丰收。全县九万亩中稻到10月29日止已收割七万四千多亩，其中四万一千五百零九亩经过核实产量，平均亩产干谷九百一十五斤，比去年平均亩产量增加23％；有二百五十亩，亩产高达一千九百斤。
    大苗山采用的粳、糯稻良种，包括圆头粳、圆头糯、白粳、黑粳、羊眼粳等一百多个品种。这些品种的普遍特点是：穗长、粒多齐整，而且适应性强、耐旱、耐肥、抗倒伏。
