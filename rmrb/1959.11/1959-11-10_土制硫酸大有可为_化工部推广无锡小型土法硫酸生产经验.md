　　Indigenous Sulfuric Acid Has Great Potential
　　Ministry of Chemical Industry Promotes Wuxi's Small-Scale Indigenous Sulfuric Acid Production Experience
　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Electric Dispatch　The Ministry of Chemical Industry recently convened a national on-site conference on small-scale contact method sulfuric acid production in Wuxi, demanding that all regions vigorously develop indigenous sulfuric acid production while developing Western-style sulfuric acid production.
　　The conference focused on introducing the experience of Wuxi Refinery in achieving a comprehensive bumper harvest of high-yield, high-quality, and low-cost indigenous sulfuric acid production, as well as the experience of Wuxi Municipal Chemical Industry authorities in adhering to putting politics in command and launching mass movements to develop small-scale indigenous sulfuric acid production.
　　Wuxi Refinery has self-reliantly built two sets of small-scale contact method sulfuric acid equipment with an annual output of 400 tons. From ore roasting furnaces, converters, and cooling pipes to absorption towers, all were made from local materials, using only a small amount of old steel, with most parts being cast iron and ceramics. The total investment was only over 15,000 yuan. Since September, these two sets of equipment have not only been producing normally, but have also reached the advanced level of indigenous sulfuric acid production nationwide. Output, concentration, and operating rates have broken through design standards. Daily output is stable at around 1,500 kilograms, with a maximum of 1,750 kilograms. In terms of quality, the concentration is stable above 66 degrees, with one-third being the higher-quality fuming sulfuric acid. The cost per ton of sulfuric acid has been reduced from over 500 yuan to 237 yuan, which is one-third lower than the local market price.
　　Because the Wuxi Municipal Chemical Industry authorities repeatedly educated cadres and the masses on adhering to the General Line and the "walking on two legs" policy, they promptly reversed the erroneous idea held by some cadres and technicians that "sulfuric acid production can only be done with Western methods." On this basis, they launched on a paired competition among all sulfuric acid production units with technological innovation as the central theme, prompting a large-scale bumper harvest of small-scale contact method sulfuric acid equipment in the city's five sulfuric acid production units.
　　At the meeting, advanced experiences in indigenous sulfuric acid production from Beijing, Shanghai, Hebei, Wuhan, Zhejiang and other places were also introduced.
　　Through the introduction of these experiences, the representatives further enhanced their understanding of indigenous sulfuric acid production, affirming its strong vitality.
　　The meeting pointed out that small-scale, indigenous sulfuric acid equipment has the characteristics of low investment, quick returns, simple production processes, and easy-to-master operating techniques. A set of Western-style sulfuric acid equipment with an annual output of 4,000 tons requires an investment of more than 500,000 yuan and takes six months to a year to build, while a set of small-scale contact method sulfuric acid equipment with an annual output of 400 tons only requires an investment of about 15,000 yuan and can be built in 10 to 20 days. The meeting put forward specific goals for further improving the level of indigenous sulfuric acid production, requiring that each set of small-scale contact method sulfuric acid equipment have an annual output of no less than 400 tons, a daily output of no less than 1,300 kilograms, and a concentration of 66 degrees. The amount of ore consumed per ton of sulfuric acid should be below 1.42 tons (calculated based on ore with 30% sulfur content); the amount of vanadium catalyst consumed should be below 200 grams.

    土制硫酸大有可为
    化工部推广无锡小型土法硫酸生产经验
    据新华社南京电　化学工业部最近在无锡召开了全国小型接触法硫酸生产现场会议，要求各地在发展洋法硫酸生产的同时，大力发展土法硫酸生产。
    会议重点介绍了无锡炼油厂土法硫酸生产获得高产优质低成本全面丰收的经验，以及无锡市化工主管部门坚持政治挂帅、大搞群众运动发展小型土法硫酸生产的经验。
    无锡炼油厂自力更生建造了两套年产四百吨的小型接触法硫酸设备，从烧矿炉、转化器、冷却管到吸收塔，都是就地取材，只用了少量旧钢材，大部分是铸铁和陶瓷品，总共投资只有一万五千多元。这两套设备，从9月以来不但生产正常，而且达到了全国土法硫酸生产的先进水平，产量、浓度、开工率已突破设计标准，日产量稳定在一千五百公斤左右，最高达一千七百五十公斤；在质量方面，浓度稳定在六十六度以上，其中有三分之一是质量更高的发烟硫酸；每吨硫酸的成本，从五百多元降低到二百三十七元，比当地市场价格低三分之一。
    无锡市化工主管部门由于反复地对干部和群众进行坚持总路线和“两条腿走路”方针的教育，及时扭转了部分干部和技术人员认为“硫酸生产非洋不行”的错误思想，在这一基础上，又发动各硫酸生产单位开展了以技术革新为中心内容的对口竞赛，促使全市五个硫酸生产单位的小型接触法硫酸设备，获得了大面积丰产。
    会上，还介绍了北京、上海、河北、武汉、浙江等地土法硫酸生产的先进经验。
    通过这些经验的介绍，到会代表进一步提高了对土法硫酸生产的认识，肯定它具有强大的生命力。
    会议指出，小型、土法硫酸设备，具有投资少、收效快、生产流程简单、操作技术容易掌握等特点。一套年产四千吨的洋法生产的硫酸设备，需要投资五十万元以上，建造时间要半年到一年；而一套年产四百吨的小型接触法硫酸设备，只需投资一万五千元左右，十天到二十天就可建成。会议提出了当前进一步提高土法硫酸生产水平的具体奋斗目标，要求每套小型接触法硫酸设备年产量不少于四百吨，日产量不少于一千三百公斤，浓度达到六十六度；每吨硫酸耗矿量达到一点四二吨以下（按含硫30％的矿石计算）；耗用钒触媒量在二百克以下。
