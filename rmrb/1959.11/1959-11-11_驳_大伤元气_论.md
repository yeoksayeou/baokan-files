    Refuting the "Greatly Impaired Vitality" Theory
    Lu Shutian
    Domestic and foreign hostile elements and domestic right-leaning opportunists are trying to obliterate the brilliant achievements of our country's economic construction, focusing their attacks on the Party's general line for socialist construction and the Great Leap Forward of 1958. They describe the Great Leap Forward of 1958 as merely due to "the large amount of material inventory carried over from the previous year," and they spread fallacies such as "the Great Leap Forward emptied the inventory and impaired vitality." We must resolutely counter these lies that distort the facts and are thorough fabrications.
    Right-leaning opportunists always see things but not people, completely ignoring the subjective initiative of people. They fail to recognize how great the difference in results can be between exerting effort and losing heart under the same material conditions. Could a large amount of material inventory carried over from the previous year alone lead to a Great Leap Forward? In previous years, the national material inventory increased almost year by year, but not every year saw a Great Leap Forward. In 1954, the inventory of steel, wood, and cement increased by 20%-52%, but this did not bring about a Great Leap Forward in 1955. In 1956, the inventory of steel and cement also increased, but this did not bring about a Great Leap Forward in 1957. The material inventory carried over from the previous year in 1958, although larger in absolute terms than in the past, saw a lower turnover rate than in previous years due to the surge in demand. However, under the glorious illumination of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, the national economy saw an unprecedented Great Leap Forward.
    In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the national economy's demand for major materials increased significantly compared to 1957. Steel and copper increased by about one time, aluminum ingots increased by about two times, coal increased by 84%, and wood increased by more than half. However, the resources of most materials grew even faster due to the rapid development of domestic industrial production. The newly added resources not only met the needs of the year but also increased the year-end inventory. For example, the inventory of pig iron and coal increased by one and a half times, copper increased by 14%, copper materials increased by 23%, and cement increased by 20%. The inventory of these materials almost exceeded that of any previous year. Can this be called "emptying the inventory"?
    Yes, in 1958, individual materials such as steel and wood were in short supply, and the inventory was slightly reduced. However, these reductions were small compared to the annual demand, with steel accounting for only about 8% and wood accounting for only 7.6%. Moreover, after the adjustments in the first half of this year, the existing inventory has been replenished. The fallacy that the Great Leap Forward was achieved by "eating up" the 1957 inventory is clearly untenable.
    In the process of high-speed development of the national economy, it is difficult to completely avoid the production of individual materials temporarily failing to keep up with demand. The question is how to deal with it. There are two ways to deal with it: one is the passive balance of "cutting the long to fit the short." If this were done, the inventory of steel and wood might not have been used or used less in 1958, resulting in a reduction of basic construction investment by 5-6 billion yuan. This would not only greatly reduce the speed of construction but also leave a large amount of other building materials, machinery, equipment, and funds idle. This is what right-leaning opportunists like but the people resolutely oppose. The other is to "promote the short to lengthen it," fully mobilizing all positive factors to better grasp and utilize existing material and technical conditions, so that they produce the greatest effect, and that individual weak links are adjusted in continued development. This is the correct approach that has been proven in practice in 1958.
    The reduction in the inventory of individual materials does not mean "tension." Everyone knows that the purpose of establishing inventory is to serve production and construction. On the one hand, with the growth of production, the inventory should generally increase accordingly. On the other hand, the inventory can also be appropriately reduced due to the gradual rationalization of industrial layout, the increase in the domestic self-sufficiency rate, and the improvement of transportation conditions. In short, the inventory is determined according to the needs of production and construction. The increase or decrease of inventory is a frequent phenomenon in the process of economic development. The view that the more inventory the better, and that reserves should be made for the sake of reserves, and that production and construction should mechanically obey material reserves is completely wrong.
    Right-leaning opportunists attack the Great Leap Forward, saying that "the Great Leap Forward wasted materials and greatly impaired the country's vitality." The facts are just the opposite. In 1958, under the encouragement of the general line, the broad masses of workers broke superstitions, emancipated their minds, and actively improved product (or engineering) designs, and the effect of improving technical operational levels and saving materials was significant. In terms of industrial production, the average consumption of steel per 100 million yuan of output value in the metal processing industry decreased by 10.7% compared to 1957, and the consumption of copper and copper materials decreased by 13.4% compared to 1957. Due to the large-scale development of "small indigenous groups" and the increased proportion of small open-pit coal mining in the coal industry, the consumption of wood per 100 million yuan of output value decreased by nearly half compared to 1957. In terms of basic construction, the average consumption of steel, wood, and cement per 100 million yuan of investment in 1958 decreased by 8%-24% compared to 1957. According to the above three accounts of metal processing, coal industry, and basic construction, about 650,000 tons of steel, 4 million cubic meters of wood, and more than 2.1 million tons of cement can be saved, saving a total value of about 900 million yuan.
    In the Great Leap Forward, idle materials were also fully utilized. For example, under the leadership of the Party, a magnificent "industrial drought resistance" movement was launched, which fully reflected the heroic spirit of the masses to be diligent and thrifty and overcome difficulties. In just a few months, a large number of scrap metals and tens of thousands of sets of various idle mechanical and electrical equipment were collected, which greatly promoted production and construction at that time. In terms of tapping the potential of equipment, the percentage of uninstalled machine tools in industrial enterprises at the end of 1958 accounted for 6.7% of the total, while during the first five-year plan, uninstalled machine tools accounted for 7.4%-12.6% of the total. The utilization rate of installed equipment in 1958 was also greatly improved. The average amount of steel materials cut per machine tool increased by 58.9% compared to 1957, and by 39.1% compared to the leaping year of 1956.
    Overall, the material supply situation in 1958 was good, guaranteeing the Great Leap Forward of the national economy in terms of material resources, and the inventory strength was also strong. Although some minor needs were taken care of less in individual links; at the same time, the use of materials was somewhat scattered; coupled with some artificial tension factors, the dispatch of materials was temporarily inflexible, etc., compared with the achievements, these shortcomings are only one finger among ten fingers. Moreover, these shortcomings have been gradually overcome. It can be seen that vigorously spreading pessimistic arguments is ill-intentioned. The wailing of right-leaning opportunists will surely be submerged in the surging tide of the Great Leap Forward.

    驳“大伤元气”论
    卢曙天
    国内外的敌对分子和国内右倾机会主义分子力图抹煞我国经济建设的辉煌成就，集中攻击党的社会主义建设总路线和1958年的大跃进，他们把1958年的大跃进，说成是仅仅由于“上年结转的物资库存多了”，而且大肆散布“大跃进吃空了库存，伤了元气”等谬论。我们对这些颠倒黑白、彻头彻尾的谎言，必须坚决给予反击。
    右倾机会主义分子总是见物不见人，完全忽视人的主观能动性，他们没有认识到，在同样的物质条件下，一鼓劲，一泄气所产生的效果相差有多大。上年结转的物资库存多了，是否就能大跃进？以往几年，全国物资库存几乎是逐年上升的，但并不是年年大跃进。1954年，钢材、木材、水泥库存增长了20％—52％，并没有给1955年带来大跃进。1956年，钢材、水泥库存也是增加的，可是也没有给1957年带来大跃进。1958年由上年结转的物资库存，虽然在绝对量上比过去增加些，但由于需要量激增，由上年结转物资的周转天数，反而比往年降低。但在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，国民经济却出现了空前未有的大跃进。
    1958年大跃进中，国民经济对主要物资的需要量，比1957年有很大的增长。钢材、铜约增加一倍左右，铝锭约增加了二倍，煤炭增加84％，木材增加了一半以上。但大多数物资的资源，由于国内工业生产的飞跃发展都增长更快。当年新增资源不但满足了当年需要，而且增加了年底库存，如生铁、煤炭库存增长了一倍半，铜增长14％，铜材增长23％，水泥增长20％，这些物资的库存几乎都超过以往的任何一年。难道这能叫做“吃空了库存”吗？
    是的，1958年个别物资如钢材、木材是供不应求的，库存略有减少的，但这些减少量与全年需要量比较起来是微小的，钢材仅占8％左右，木材仅占7.6％。何况经过今年上半年的调整，现有库存都得到充实。把大跃进说成是“吃”了1957年库存才得来的谬论，显然是站不住脚的。
    在国民经济高速度发展过程中，个别物资的生产一时跟不上需要，是难以完全避免的。问题在于如何处理。有两种处理办法：一种是“削长就短”的消极平衡。如果这样做，1958年可能不动用或少动用些钢材和木材库存，其结果是基本建设投资就得削减五、六十亿元。这样不但大大降低了建设速度，而且使其他建筑材料、机器设备和资金大量闲置起来。这是右倾机会主义分子所喜欢而人民所坚决反对的。另一种是“促短就长”，充分调动一切积极因素，去更好地掌握和利用现有物质技术条件，使其产生最大的效果，使个别薄弱环节在继续发展中得到调整。这是1958年实践中得到证明的正确做法。
    个别物资库存减少了，并不等于“紧张”。大家知道，建立库存的目的是为生产建设服务。一方面，随着生产的增长，库存量一般要相应的增加；另一方面，由于工业布局渐趋合理、国内生产自给率提高、交通运输条件改善等，库存量也可以适当地减少。总之，库存是根据生产建设的需要决定的。库存的增减是经济发展过程中的经常现象。那种认为库存愈多愈好，为储备而储备，这种要求生产建设机械地服从物资储备的观点，是十分错误的。
    右倾机会主义分子攻击大跃进，说什么“大跃进，浪费了物资，大伤了国家元气”。事实恰恰相反。1958年广大职工在总路线的鼓舞下，破除迷信，解放思想，积极改进产品（或工程）设计，提高技术操作水平，节约物资的效果是显著的。在工业生产方面，金属加工工业平均每亿元产值消耗钢材比1957年降低10.7％，消耗铜和铜材比1957年降低13.4％；煤炭工业由于大搞“小土群”，小露天采煤的比重增加，每亿元产值消耗木材比1957年降低将近一半。在基本建设方面，1958年平均每亿元投资消耗钢材、木材、水泥比1957年降低了8％—24％。按以上金属加工、煤炭工业和基本建设三笔账计算，就可节约钢材六十五万吨左右，木材四百万立方米，水泥二百一十多万吨，节约总值九亿元左右。
    在大跃进中，还充分挖掘了闲置的物资。例如，在党的领导下掀起了规模壮阔的“工业抗旱”运动，充分体现了群众的克勤克俭、战胜困难的英雄气概，仅几个月内，就收集大量废金属和闲置的各种机电设备数万台，对当时的生产建设起到很大的促进作用。在挖掘设备潜力方面，1958年底工业企业中未安装的机床占拥有量6.7％，而第一个五年计划期间，未安装的机床占拥有量的7.4％—12.6％。1958年已安装的设备利用率也大大提高了，平均每台机床切削钢铁材料的数量比1957年提高了58.9％，比跃进的1956年也提高了39.1％。
    总的看来，1958年物资供应情况是良好的，在物力上保证了国民经济的大跃进，库存实力也是雄厚的。尽管在个别环节上对某些次要需要照顾少了些；同时物资使用有些分散；加上某些人为紧张因素，使物资一时调度不灵等，但与成绩比起来，这些缺点不过是十个指头中一个指头的问题。何况这些缺点已逐步得到克服。可见大力散布悲观论调是别有用心的。右倾机会主义分子的哀鸣，必将淹没在汹涌澎湃的大跃进浪潮中。
