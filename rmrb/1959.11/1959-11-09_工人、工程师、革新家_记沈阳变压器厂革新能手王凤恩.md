    Worker, Engineer, Innovator
    ——Remembering Wang Feng'en, Innovation Expert of Shenyang Transformer Factory
    Wang Feng'en, an engineer from Shenyang Transformer Factory who started as a worker, has held high the red flag of technical innovation. Under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the masses, he has realized more than 230 innovation creations in the past eight years, averaging more than one innovation every ten days. Among them, 117 alone have saved the country 1.15 million yuan. He also spares no effort to help others, and in the past year or so, he has helped others realize more than 70 innovations. Originally, 70% of the work in the insulation workshop where he worked was manual, but now 80% has been converted to mechanized production. This year, the production capacity of the entire workshop has tripled compared with the great leap forward in 1958.
    Wang Feng'en, an old worker with more than 20 years of experience, had only three years of education ten years ago, but now he has entered the ranks of experts. During the Great Leap Forward last year, he was promoted to engineer and was hired as a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Northeastern University.
    Difficulties Scared Away One by One
    Comrades in the factory said: "When Master Wang gets involved in innovation, he really gets into it!" Once, the factory was producing the largest transformer in the country, and the user was waiting anxiously to use it. However, the insulation cylinder on the transformer could not be manufactured due to equipment limitations, and it could not be bought in China, and it was too late to order it from the Soviet Union. The leadership convened several symposiums for engineering technicians and veteran workers to ask everyone to come up with ideas. Wang Feng'en boldly proposed: "We will make a coiling machine and manufacture the insulation cylinder ourselves!" At that time, there was no information, and he had never even seen what a coiling machine looked like. Wang Feng'en was inspired by the fact that the winding machine could wind the wire circle by circle, so he found some waste materials from the scrap heap to try to make a coiling machine. After more than ten failures, a kind of native machine was created. However, the bakelite cylinder produced either bubbled or had wrinkles. He moved his luggage next to the machine and squatted next to the machine day and night, constantly experimenting, sometimes sleeping next to the machine. He studied like this for a long time, but the quality problem was still not solved. Some well-meaning people advised him, "Forget it, don't waste your time blindly. The Japanese devils have been doing it here for more than ten years and haven't succeeded." Wang Feng'en said confidently, "If the Japanese devils didn't succeed, we must succeed!" One night he returned home and his wife was ironing clothes. As soon as the iron passed, the clothes were flat and neat. Wang Feng'en was attracted by it, and he thought, "Can't the insulation paper also be ironed flat?" He snatched the electric iron from his wife's hand and ran out, and it wasn't until his wife stopped him that he remembered that there was no electricity in the workshop tonight. Back in the room, he repeatedly experimented with crumpled waste paper. He was so excited that he couldn't sleep that night. The next day, he installed the electric iron on the machine for testing, and as a result, he processed a flat and smooth insulation cylinder. With this kind of equipment, the large transformer was guaranteed to leave the factory on schedule. Wang Feng'en's spirit of not being afraid of difficulties, painstakingly researching, and making a big technical revolution moved many people. Someone wrote a limerick for Wang Feng'en: "You dare to think, dare to speak, dare to create, you dare to challenge difficulties, it is not that difficulties defeat you, but that difficulties are scared away by you one by one!"
    Key Problems Solved One by One
    Wang Feng'en's inventions and creations have solved many major key problems in production. In the past eight years, as soon as he successfully tested a key equipment, he attacked another key production problem. The production capacity of the insulation workshop was very low, only 30% of the production was machine operation, and the rest was manual operation. Last year, during the technical revolution, Wang Feng'en and the workers jointly formulated a technical innovation plan, preparing to realize the mechanization of the entire workshop in four years. Later, he and everyone discussed together, calculated the details, and further revised the plan, deciding to basically realize mechanized production in the workshop in one year. Now his plan has been realized: machines are lined up in the workshop, and the sound of machines running and motors replaces the sound of hammers and hand saws from the past. Wang Feng'en enthusiastically responded to the Party's great call to vigorously increase production and practice economy with creative labor. Together with the technical innovation team he led, he realized three technical innovations in six days, breaking through key problems such as insufficient manpower for manufacturing high-voltage bushings. This batch of high-voltage bushings was a collaborative part produced for Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory. The technical requirements were complex and the time was urgent. If the task was not completed, the entire set of high-voltage equipment of the high-voltage switch factory would not be able to leave the factory. In the past, the entire workshop could complete a maximum of two sets per month, but this batch of tasks was seventy-five sets. Because there were many manual operation processes, fifty man-hours were lacking to complete this task. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party branch, he led the technical innovation team to fight for high-voltage bushings, using the method of realizing the automation of high-voltage bushings. After seven or eight repeated tests, they finally developed an automatic pipe cutting device, and as a result, they completed this batch of collaborative tasks ahead of schedule.
    Technical Consultant of the Whole Factory
    In order to help people master advanced technology, Wang Feng'en sorted out his technical experience accumulated over the past 20 years and wrote a technical book of more than 10,000 words, "Manufacturing Process of Insulating Bakelite Cylinders," which was widely taught to the workers and masses.
    Comrades in the factory said: "If Wang Feng'en had ten thousand bodies and twenty thousand hands, he wouldn't leave a finger for himself." He enthusiastically helps others, treats others' difficulties as his own, and spares no effort. The paper cutting team in the factory used manual operation, which was not only laborious and inefficient, but also the phenol and aldehyde on the adhesive paper fell on the necks and hands of the female workers, causing unbearable itching. Seeing this situation, Wang Feng'en was determined to make an automatic paper cutting machine to replace manual operation. Just as the research on the paper cutting machine was making headway, his arthritis relapsed due to excessive day and night labor, and his legs were like two wooden sticks that could not bend at all. Many people advised him to take a rest, but he resolutely said: "The Volunteer Army in Korea will not leave the front line with minor injuries, what is my little illness?" The medical office gave him a leave certificate, but he kept it in his pocket all the time. Later, the Party branch made a decision, limiting him to go to the sanatorium the next day. Until that night, he still worked for half the night and drew all the improved drawings, and handed them over to the workshop director before leaving. After he returned from recuperation, he saw that the manual paper cutting task in the insulation workshop was heavy, which had a great impact on the rapid improvement of production in the whole factory, so he stepped up the research and creation of automatic paper cutting machine. It was not until the eighteenth experiment was finally successful that the production efficiency was fifteen times higher than manual operation. During the Great Leap Forward, Wang Feng'en was regarded as a technical consultant for the entire workshop and the entire factory. He helped this person make key parts for a while, and then helped that person revise the drawings of technical innovations. He regarded helping others as more important than innovating his own technology. Last year, he realized 14 major innovations himself, but helped others realize 48 innovations.
    "Omnipotent Teacher"
    "The masses are omnipotent teachers. If you discuss things with the masses and rely on the masses, there is no problem that cannot be solved." This is what Wang Feng'en often said. When he found that his pipe winding technology was not as good as Pei Shouzhi, a worker in the workshop, he humbly learned Pei Shouzhi's experience of "orderly paper is correct, and the pulling force is even." When Wang Feng'en was researching and improving the laminated ring milling machine, he first sought the opinions of the direct operators. After everyone's joint research, a laminated ring milling machine was made, and the workers no longer had to use grinding wheels, and they no longer had to worry about accidents. Once again, he tried to make a pipe winding machine, and the machine was assembled, but it didn't work. He disassembled the entire machine parts and checked them one by one, and found that the forward and reverse roller speeds were uneven, sometimes turning and sometimes stopping. Although the problem was found, he thought about it all night and couldn't come up with a good solution. The next day, his apprentice Liu Yuwen came to work, and Wang Feng'en asked his apprentice if he had any ideas? Little Liu thought for a long time and said, "Master Wang, is it okay to force it to turn?!" "Force it to turn"! Wang Feng'en thought for a while, excitedly slapped his thigh and said, "Yes! Use the rotating one to drive the non-rotating one, force it to turn!" Then he said: "Little Liu, I racked my brains all night and couldn't figure it out, you solved it in one sentence, you are my master!" He used this method, and the machine was successfully tested.

    工人、工程师、革新家
    ——记沈阳变压器厂革新能手王凤恩
    沈阳变压器厂工人出身的工程师王凤恩，高举技术革新的红旗，在党的领导下和在群众的支持下，八年来实现了二百三十多项革新创造，平均每十天多一点就实现一项。仅其中一百一十七项，就为国家节约了一百一十五万元。他还不遗余力地帮助别人，仅最近一年多的时间，就帮助别人实现了七十多项革新创造。原来他所在的绝缘车间有70％是手工操作，现在已经80％改为机械化生产。今年全车间的生产能力，比特大跃进的1958年又提高了三倍。
    王凤恩，这位具有二十多年工龄的老工人，十年前只有三年文化程度，现在已经步入专家行列。去年在大跃进的日子里，他被提升为工程师，又被聘请为东北工学院的电力系教授。
    一个个困难被吓跑
    厂里的同志说：“王师傅搞起革新来，真是钻到心眼里！”有一次工厂生产国内最大的变压器，用户等着急用。但变压器上的绝缘筒，因受设备限制，不能制造，国内也买不到，向苏联订货又来不及。领导上召开了几次工程技术人员和老工人的座谈会，让大家想办法。王凤恩大胆地提出：“我们做一台卷筒机，自己制造绝缘筒！”当时没有资料，连卷筒机是个什么样子他也没见过。王凤恩看到卷线机能把线一圈一圈绕上去，使他受到启发，于是，他便从废铁堆里找出一些废料来试制卷筒机。经过十几次的失败，把一种土机器搞成了。但是加工出来的电木筒不是起泡就是有皱纹。他把行李搬在机器旁，日夜蹲在机器旁边不停地进行试验，有时就睡在机器旁。这样钻研了很久，但质量问题仍然没有解决。有些好心的人就劝他说：“算了吧，别瞎子点灯白费腊啦，过去日本鬼子在这里搞了十多年也没搞成呢。”王凤恩信心十足地说：“日本鬼子没搞成，我们一定要把它搞成！”一天晚上他回到家里，妻子正在熨衣服。熨斗一过，衣服平平整整的。王凤恩被它吸引住了，他想：“绝缘纸不是也可以熨平吗？”他一把抢去妻子手中的电熨斗就往外奔，直到妻子叫住他，他才想起今晚车间里没有电。回到屋里就用废纸揉皱了反复试验。这一夜，他兴奋得没有睡着觉。第二天，他把电熨斗装在机器上进行试验，结果把平正光净的绝缘筒加工出来了。有了这种设备，便保证了大型变压器按期出厂。王凤恩这种不怕困难，苦心钻研，大闹技术革命的精神，感动了许多人。有人给王凤恩写了一段顺口溜：“你敢想敢说敢创造，你敢向困难下战表，不是困难战胜了你，是一个个困难被你吓跑！”
    一个个关键被攻破
    王凤恩的发明创造，解决了许多生产上的重大关键。八年来，他总是刚把一个关键设备试验成功，又向另一个生产关键进攻。绝缘车间生产能力很低，只有30％的生产是机器操作，其余全是手工操作。去年大闹技术革新，王凤恩和工人们一起订了一个技术革新规划，准备用四年时间实现全车间机械化。后来他又和大家一起讨论，算细账，进一步修改了规划，决定用一年时间，使车间基本上实现机械化生产。现在他的规划已经实现了：车间里机器已经成排，机器的运转声、马达声，代替了从前的锤子响、手锯响。王凤恩又用创造性的劳动热烈响应党的厉行增产节约的伟大号召，和他所领导的技术革新大队一起，在六天之内就实现了三项技术革新，突破了制造高压套管人力不足等关键。这批高压套管是为沈阳高压开关厂生产的协作件，技术要求复杂，要的时间急迫，如果任务完不成，就会使高压开关厂一整套的高压设备不能出厂。过去全车间每月最多能完成两套，而这批任务是七十五套，由于手工操作过程多，要完成这个任务缺五十个工时。于是在党支部的领导下，他带领技术革新大队大战高压套管，用实现高压套管自动化的方法，经过七、八次反复试验，终于研究出一种切管自动装置，结果提前完成了这批协作任务。
    全厂的技术顾问
    王凤恩为了帮助人们掌握先进技术，把自己二十多年来积累的技术经验，整理出来，写出了一本长达万余字的“绝缘电木筒制造工艺”的技术书籍，广泛向职工群众进行了传授。
    厂里的同志说：“假如王凤恩有一万个身子，两万只手，也不会给自己留下一节手指头。”他热心地帮助别人，把别人的困难当成自己的困难，毫不吝惜自己的精力。厂里裁纸小组用手工操作，不仅劳累效率低，而且胶纸上的酚酫飞落到女工的脖子上和手上，奇痒难受。王凤恩看到这种情况，决心要制造一台自动裁纸机来代替手工操作。研究裁纸机刚刚有了眉目的时候，由于日夜过度劳累，他的关节炎复发了，两条腿像两根木棍子根本打不了弯。许多人都劝他去休养，可是他斩钉截铁地说：“志愿军在朝鲜轻伤不下火线，我这点小病算得了什么。”医务所给他休假证明书，可是他一直把它揣在口袋里。后来党支部作出决定，限他第二天就去疗养院。直到当天晚上，他还工作半宿，把改进的图样全部画了出来，临走前交给了车间主任。他休养回来后，看见绝缘车间的手工裁纸任务很重，对全厂生产的迅速提高有很大影响，就加紧研究创造自动裁纸机。直到第十八次试验到底成功了，生产效率比手工操作提高了十五倍。在大跃进中，王凤恩被人看成全车间、全厂的技术顾问。他一会儿帮助这个人做关键部件，一会儿又帮助那个人修改技术革新的图纸。他把帮助别人看得比自己革新技术还重要。去年，他自己实现了重大革新十四项，却帮助别人实现了四十八项。
    “万能老师”
    “群众是万能老师，有事和群众商量，依靠群众，就没有解决不了的问题。”这是王凤恩常说的话。当他发现自己的卷管技术比车间工人裴守志差些的时候，他就虚心地学习裴守志的“序纸正，拉力均”的经验。在王凤恩研究改进层压圈铣床时，首先征求直接操作者的意见。经过大家共同研究，制成了层压圈铣床，工人们不再用砂轮磨活，也不担心出事故了。又一次，他试制一台卷管机械，机器装配成了，可是不管用。他拆下整个机器零件，挨个检查，发现是反正滚子转数不匀，时转时停。毛病虽然查出来了，但他想了一夜，也没想出好办法来。第二天他的徒弟刘玉文来上班，王凤恩就问徒弟有没有办法？小刘想了半天说：“王师傅，硬叫它转不行吗？！”“硬叫它转”！王凤恩想了想，兴奋地一拍大腿说：“对！用转的带动不转的，硬叫它转！”接着又说：“小刘，我苦思一夜也没想出道道来，你一句话就妥了，你是我的师傅！”他就是用了这个办法，机器试验成功了。
