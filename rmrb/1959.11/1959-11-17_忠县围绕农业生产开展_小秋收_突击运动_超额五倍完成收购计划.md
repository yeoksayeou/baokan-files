    Zhongxian County Launches "Small Autumn Harvest" Blitz Centered on Agricultural Production
    Exceeds Procurement Plan by Five Times

    Editor's Note: The "Small Autumn Harvest" blitz launched in Zhongxian County, Sichuan, achieved great results in ten days. Zhongxian's experience proves that under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, by fully leveraging the superiority of the People's Communes, making every effort to tap labor potential, and launching mass movements on a large scale, it is possible to simultaneously do a good job in "Four Autumns" production and "Small Autumn Harvest."

    November is the last opportunity to collect wild plants. All localities should rely on the Party committees, adopt effective measures, further mobilize the masses, and push the "Small Autumn Harvest" movement to a higher climax, striving to complete or over fulfill the task of collecting and purchasing wild plant materials.

    (Our report) Masses in Zhongxian County, Sichuan Province, under the leadership of the county party committee, launched a large-scale "Small Autumn Harvest" blitz. From October 21st, 400,000 people went into the mountains for ten days, collecting over 90 million jin of wild plant materials. State commercial departments purchased 47 million jin, exceeding the purchase volume of the previous nine months by over 77%, and increasing by more than four times compared to the entire last year. From January to the end of October this year, state commercial departments purchased over 730,000 dan, completing and exceeding the annual plan by 5.4 times ahead of schedule. In total, the income of commune members increased by more than 5 million yuan, averaging 33 yuan per household and more than 17 yuan per laborer. The Ministry of Commerce recently issued a circular to all localities, requesting them to learn from Zhongxian County's experience.

    Since mid-October, Zhongxian County has organized a propaganda force of 5,000 people, using various forms to publicize the important significance of collecting wild plants in strengthening the economic strength of the communes and promoting industrial and agricultural production, and widely clarifying the policies. On the basis of raising awareness and unifying understanding, pledge rallies were held at all levels to create momentum, boost morale, and launch red banner emulation competitions. Under the unified leadership of the Party committees, the communes adopted ten measures centered on agricultural production, tapping labor potential on a large scale to ensure the simultaneous leap forward development of "Four Autumns" (autumn harvest, autumn planting, autumn plowing, and autumn storage) production and the collection of wild plant materials. These ten measures are: (1) Organize professional teams to collect. In this regard, localities planned to allocate 10%-20% of the labor force, totaling 45,000 people. (2) Produce during the day and collect at night. On the night of October 20th, 120,000 people in the county went into the mountains and collected over 6.34 million jin of wild materials in one night. (3) Three people produce, two people work, freeing up one person to go into the mountains. The Yangxing Production Team of the Shizi Commune, with 85 laborers, sent 33 people into the mountains, collecting over 20,000 jin of wild plant materials every day; the remaining 52 commune members also did a fast and good job in "Four Autumns" production. (4) Strive for production in the morning, and draw people to the mountains in the afternoon. The Shuanghe District Team of the Wangshui Commune, with 200 laborers, ate meals by lamplight and went to work at dawn. Half a day's labor was better than a whole day's, and in the afternoon they concentrated on the collection of wild materials. (5) Collect on the spot during work breaks, and collect along the way when returning home from work. (6) Organize cattle herders and firewood collectors to collect along the way. (7) Combine with the school's work-study program to organize students to collect in their spare time. (8) Organize cadres and teachers to collect during holidays. (9) Organize the elderly to collect. (10) Organize residents and small vendors in market towns to collect. In terms of income distribution, for collective organization collection, work points are assessed as usual, and the income belongs to the commune; for commune members' after-work collection, whoever collects it gets it; for school work-study collection, the income belongs to the school, and for after-school collection, the income is self-earned. In this way, the enthusiasm of all parties was fully mobilized, and a mass collection craze was quickly formed.

    During the movement, localities also adopted measures such as "Four Determinations," "Four Ascents to the Mountains," "Five On-the-Spots," and "Four Combinations." "Four Determinations" refers to determining personnel, determining tasks, determining time, and conducting regular inspections and evaluations. "Four Ascents to the Mountains" refers to commercial staff going to the mountains, funds going to the mountains, scales going to the mountains, and transportation going to the mountains. "Five On-the-Spots" refers to on-the-spot turning, drying, and sorting, on-the-spot acceptance, on-the-spot weighing, on-the-spot payment, and on-the-spot organization of mass transportation. "Four Combinations" refers to combining the collection of wild plant materials with central work, combining the purchase of large-volume products with the purchase of small-volume products, combining purchase with publicity, and combining collection with cultivation. In addition, commercial departments have also added more than 1,200 temporary purchasing points, adopting ten purchasing methods such as mobile collection, fixed collection, daytime collection, nighttime collection, sunny day collection, rainy day collection, collecting more, collecting less, collecting whenever available, and collecting sooner or later, making every effort to benefit the masses and support production.

    While collecting and purchasing, localities are also engaged in processing and utilization on a large scale. In processing and production, the county fully paid attention to combining centralized processing with decentralized processing, commercial department processing with organizing mass processing, and indigenous processing with semi-mechanized processing. At present, the county has established 2,097 permanent and seasonal factories for brewing, rubber baking, paper making, medicinal material processing, pesticides, non-staple foods, starch, feed, and fiber processing, of which 244 are run by commercial departments or jointly with commune production teams, and 1,853 are run by commune management districts and production teams. In order to promote processing technology, commercial departments have also organized on-site visits, technical exchange meetings, and training courses many times, training 673 various technical personnel for communes and grassroots commercial departments to meet the needs of widespread processing. In addition, localities have also mobilized the masses to engage in technical innovation on a large scale. From January to October, the county created and innovated 51 kinds of tools. For example, the Qijiahe Fiber Factory created hammering machines, washing machines, pulping machines, etc., which greatly reduced labor intensity, saved labor, reduced costs, and improved quality. As of the end of October, the county used wild plant materials to produce 89,000 jin of rayon, 243,500 ropes, 167,300 jin of local liquor, 217,310 jin of candy, 6,750 jin of oil, and processed 571,430 jin of medicinal materials, with a total value of more than 1.2 million yuan; saving more than 400,000 jin of grain, and developing more than 200 new varieties. The county is advancing victoriously, striving for a greater victory in the "Small Autumn Harvest."

    忠县围绕农业生产开展“小秋收”突击运动
    超额五倍完成收购计划
    编者按：四川忠县开展的“小秋收”突击运动，十天取得很大成绩。忠县的经验证明：在各级党委的领导下，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，千方百计挖掘劳动潜力，大搞群众运动，就能把“四秋”生产和“小秋收”同时搞好。
    11月份是采集野生植物的最后时机，各地要依靠党委，采取有力措施，进一步发动群众，把“小秋收”运动推向更高潮，力争完成或超额完成野生植物原料的采集和收购任务。
    本报讯　四川忠县群众在县委领导下，大搞“小秋收”突击运动，从10月21日起，四十万人上山十天，采集野生植物原料九千多万斤。国家商业部门收购了四千七百万斤，比前九个多月收购数超过77％，比去年全年增加四倍多。今年1至10月底，国家商业部门收购七十三万多担，提前和超额完成年计划的五点四倍。总共增加社员收入五百多万元，平均每户收入三十三元，每个劳动力收入十七元多。商业部最近通报各地，要求学习忠县的经验。
    从10月中旬以来，忠县组织了五千人的宣传大军，通过各种形式，宣传采集野生植物对增强公社经济力量，促进工农业生产的重要意义，并广泛讲明了政策。在提高思想、统一认识的基础上，层层召开誓师大会，造声势，鼓干劲，开展红旗评比竞赛。各公社在党委统一领导下，围绕农业生产，采取十项措施，大挖劳动潜力，保证“四秋”（秋收、秋种、秋耕、秋藏）生产和采集野生植物原料同时飞跃发展，这十项措施是：（1）组织专业队采挖。在这方面，各地计安排10％—20％的劳力共四万五千人。（2）白天生产，晚上采挖。10月20日晚上，全县十二万人上山，一夜采集六百三十四万多斤野生原料。（3）三人生产，两人干，挤出一人上山。石子公社杨兴生产队八十五个劳力，抽出三十三人上山，每天采挖野生植物原料二万多斤；留下的五十二个社员，也把“四秋”生产搞得又快又好。（4）上午努力生产，下午抽人上山。望水公社双河区队二百个劳力，点灯吃饭，天明出工，劳动半天胜过一天，下午就集中突击采挖。（5）做活休息时就地采挖，收工回家时沿途采挖。（6）组织放牛娃、打柴童顺便采挖。（7）结合学校勤工俭学，组织学生课余采挖。（8）假期组织干部教师采挖。（9）组织老人采挖。
  （10）组织场镇居民和小商贩采挖。在收益分配上对集体组织采集的，工分照评，收入归社；社员工余采集的，谁采谁得；学校勤工俭学采集的，收入归学校，课余采集的，收入自得。这样就充分调动了各方面的积极性，很快形成了群众性的采集热潮。
    在运动中，各地还采取了“四定”“四上山”“五就”“四结合”等措施。“四定”，是定人员，定任务，定时间，定期检查评比。“四上山”，是商业工作人员上山，资金上山，衡器上山，运输上山。“五就”，是就地翻晒整理，就地验收，就地过秤，就地付款，就地组织群众集运。“四结合”是采集野生植物原料与中心工作结合，收购大宗产品与收购小宗产品结合，收购与宣传结合，采挖与培植结合。此外商业部门还增设了临时收购点一千二百多个，采取流动收，固定收，白天收，晚上收，天晴收，落雨收，多也收，少也收，随到随收，早迟都收等十种收购方式，千方百计，有利群众，支持生产。
    在采集收购的同时，各地大搞加工利用。在加工生产中，该县充分注意了集中加工与分散加工，商业部门加工与组织群众加工，土法加工与半机械加工相结合。目前全县已办酿酒、烤胶、造纸、药材加工、农药、副食品、淀粉、饲料、纤维加工等常年的和季节性的工厂二千零九十七个，其中商业部门办的或与公社生产队合办的二百四十四个，公社管理区和生产队办的一千八百五十三个。为了推广加工技术，商业部门还多次组织现场参观、技术交流会、办训练班等办法，给公社和基层商业部门培训各种技术人员六百七十三名，以适应广泛开展加工的需要。另外各地还发动群众大搞技术革新，全县1至10月份创造和革新的工具达五十一种。如戚家河纤维厂创造了锤打机、洗料机、打浆机等，大大减轻了劳力强度，节约了劳力，降低了成本，提高了质量。全县截至10月底止，利用野生植物原料生产了人造棉八万九千斤，绳索二十四万三千五百根，土酒十六万七千三百斤，糖果二十一万七千三百一十斤，油脂六千七百五十斤，加工药材五十七万一千四百三十斤，总值一百二十多万元；节约粮食四十多万斤，新制品种达二百多种。全县正乘胜挺进，争取“小秋收”的更大胜利。
