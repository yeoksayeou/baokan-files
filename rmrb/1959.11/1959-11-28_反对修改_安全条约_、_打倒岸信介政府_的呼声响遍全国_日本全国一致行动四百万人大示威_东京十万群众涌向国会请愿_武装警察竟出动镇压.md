Xinhua News Agency, 27th dispatch from Tokyo: Approximately four million workers, farmers, students, women, teachers, and members of the cultural community across more than 650 cities and regions in Japan today jointly held an unprecedentedly massive eighth nationwide unified action to oppose the revision and strive for the abrogation of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Two million workers belonging to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and independent unions took the lead this morning by holding strikes and workplace rallies, including numerous departments such as coal, railway, chemical, postal, transportation, and metal mines, and telecommunications.

Beginning in the afternoon, people from all walks of life in various regions successively held protest rallies and demonstrations. The cries of "Oppose the Revision of the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty'," "Demand the Abrogation of the 'Security Treaty'," "Demand the Resignation of Nobusuke Kishi," and "Down with the Nobusuke Kishi Government" resounded throughout the country.

In Tokyo, a historically large petition was submitted to the Diet, which is currently in session, by a total of 100,000 people. The area surrounding the Diet became a sea of red flags and banners, with slogans and songs rising and falling, surging and pounding. The Nobusuke Kishi government was faced with a formidable enemy, dispatching 5,500 armed police and armored vehicles to surround the Diet Building, attempting to prevent the petitioners from entering the Diet. However, the demonstrators broke through the police blockade and submitted the petition to the Diet. The petition stated: Revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will place Japan in danger and create a new war crisis in Asia. The petition demanded that the government immediately cease negotiations to revise the "Security Treaty."

Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, and Akira Iwai, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, etc., rode in propaganda vehicles calling on the people to oppose the "Security Treaty." In his speech, Inejiro Asanuma said that Nobusuke Kishi had already driven our millions of fathers and brothers to the battlefield to their deaths during the Tojo Cabinet era. Now, we must do everything possible to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty."

Because the police blocked petitioners from entering the Diet and beat them, more than two hundred petitioners were injured.

In Osaka, 45,000 people held a general uprising rally. The meeting passed a resolution expressing their determination to fight to the end to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty." A lantern parade was also held in the evening.

Similar gatherings and demonstrations were held in major cities such as Kyoto, Kobe, and Nagoya. The number of participants far exceeded the number of people in the unified action against the revision of the "Police Duties Law" last autumn.

The people of Kanagawa Prefecture held strikes and demonstrations against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" around twenty-three U.S. military bases.

In Kyushu, the southernmost coal mining center, coal miners held a twenty-four-hour strike, and workers in other industries held scheduled strikes and workplace rallies. The people of Fukuoka City also held a rally in the rain.

The people of Hokkaido, the northernmost region, also held gatherings and parades.

The National Council Against the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," which led the nationwide unified action, issued a statement tonight expressing its anger at the government's suppression of the petitioning people. The statement said that in order to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," we must take the eighth unified action as a starting point and further launch a nationwide struggle.

    在东京，共有十万人向正在开会的国会举行了规模空前的请愿。国会周围成为红旗和标语牌的海洋，口号声和歌声此起彼落，汹涌澎湃。岸信介政府如临大敌，出动了五千五百名武装警察和装甲车包围了国会大厦，企图阻止请愿的人们进入国会。但是示威者冲破了警察的封锁线，向国会提交了请愿书。请愿书写道：修改日美“安全条约”将使日本陷于危险之中，会在亚洲造成新的战争危机。请愿书要求政府立即停止修改“安全条约”的谈判。
    日本共产党主席野坂参三、社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎、日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章等坐着宣传车呼吁人民反对“安全条约”。浅沼稻次郎在讲话中说，岸信介在东条内阁时代就已经把我们的成百万的父兄赶到了战场而死亡。现在，我们要尽一切努力来阻止修改“安全条约”。
    由于警察阻拦请愿者进入国会并殴打他们，共有二百多个请愿者受伤。
    在大阪，四万五千人举行了总奋起大会。大会通过决议，表示要为阻止修改“安全条约”而斗争到底。晚间还举行了提灯游行。
    在京都、神户、名古屋等大城市也都举行了同样的集会和示威游行。参加的人数都远远超过了去年秋天反对修改“警职法”统一行动的人数。
