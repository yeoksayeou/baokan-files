(This article was) transmitted by our newspaper Zhengzhou, November 21st: The No. 2 Steel Plant in Anyang City, Henan Province, achieved a continuous series of record-breaking successes with its eight-cubic-meter blast furnace. On the basis of an average daily output of 12.8 tons of pig iron in early November, it increased to 15.748 tons on the 11th, 25.838 tons on the 12th, 30.444 tons on the 13th, and soared to 33 tons on the 16th. The qualification rate of pig iron was 100%, and the coke consumption per ton of iron was 0.98. This created a new record of comprehensive leap forward with high production and high quality for small blast furnaces.

	Continuous revolution in thought and continuous increase in production are the main characteristics of this small blast furnace’s high production and high quality. In October, this small blast furnace had created a high production record of more than 24 tons of pig iron per day. Later, due to the right-leaning thought of "production reaching its peak" among a few people, the output dropped sharply. In order to reverse this situation in a timely manner, the Party Committee of the plant led all the workers to carry out a debate based on the general line to investigate accidents and find out the causes, greatly breaking down right-leaning conservative thinking, and set off a labor competition upsurge between shifts, between people, and between pacesetters, which laid a ideological foundation for high production and high quality for the three shifts of workers in this small blast furnace to be consistent in their thinking and unified in their operations.

	The workers of this plant vigorously promoted the advanced experience of strong wind, high temperature, and heavy load. The Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, together with the workers, thickened the small blast furnace pipe from the original 200 cm in diameter to 250 cm, and changed the "T" shaped elbows to straight pipes or gentle elbows, which increased the wind temperature by 210 degrees, the iron production rose in a straight line, and the maximum reached 33 tons on the 16th, more than double the average daily output in early November.

    思想不断革命　技术不断革新
    安阳一座小高炉  连创日产新纪录
    本报郑州21日电　河南省安阳市第二钢铁厂八立方米高炉，在11月上旬平均日产铸造铁十二点八吨的基础上，11日提高到十五点七四八吨，12日提高到二十五点八三八吨，13日提高到三十点四四四吨，16日又猛增到三十三吨；生铁合格率100％，吨铁耗焦量零点九八。创造了小高炉高产优质全面跃进的新纪录。
    思想不断革命，产量连续上升，是这座小高炉高产优质的主要特点。10月份这座小高炉曾经创造日产生铁二十四吨多的高产纪录。后来由于少数人产生了“生产到顶”的右倾思想，使产量急剧下降。为了及时扭转这种局面，厂党委领导全厂职工以总路线为标准开展了查事故、找原因的鸣放辩论，大破右倾保守思想，掀起了班与班、人与人、标兵与标兵的劳动竞赛热潮，使这个小高炉的三班工人思想一致，操作统一，为高产优质奠定了思想基础。
    这个厂的职工，大力推广了大风、高温、重负荷的先进经验；厂党委副书记和工人一起，把小高炉管道由原来直径二百厘米，加粗为二百五十厘米，把“丁”字形弯管改为直管或漫弯管，使风温提高了二百一十度，铁产量直线上升，16日最高达到三十三吨，比11月上旬平均日产量提高一倍多。
