Xu Boling has been a civil aviation pilot for more than three years. In the past three years, he has flown 3,853 hours, with a total voyage of more than 1,155,000 kilometers. This distance is equivalent to circling the Earth's equator about thirty times. He has successfully completed various transportation tasks, especially in some flights transporting the Party and state leaders and foreign guests, where the tasks were completed even more excellently. He has high flying skills and a strong sense of responsibility. He has never had an accident in his journey of more than one million kilometers.

Xu Boling was born into a poor peasant family and only attended elementary school for two years as a child. Under the cultivation of the Party, with the patient help of Soviet comrades, and with the economic construction of the motherland attracting him like a magnet, he quickly became an excellent pilot.

The highest principle of air life is to ensure safety. Otherwise, it will cause serious losses to the country politically and economically. Ensuring safety is the common responsibility of air and ground crew, but it is more directly related to the captain. Therefore, he always puts his heart and soul into ensuring safety when performing any flight mission. Last year, the leadership asked him to pick up distinguished guests abroad. Naturally, he knew this was a very honorable task, but he hesitated: "Can I complete such an important special flight mission for the first time?" The leadership saw through his "concerns" and encouraged him, saying: "Remain calm, be careful, rely on the masses, cooperate well, and prepare thoroughly, and you will be able to complete the task." His mood gradually calmed down. He deeply engraved these instructions in his heart. Before departing from Beijing, the brigade leaders, engineers, and Party负责人 personally checked a series of preparations. When he and his comrades arrived abroad, they still worked as meticulously as embroidery. He organized everyone to analyze the clouds on the route, the mountains and rivers along the route... hoping to find the best route from them. He organized everyone to carefully inspect the aircraft. He knew that "mechanical inspection" was a crucial checkpoint to ensure safety. Therefore, over the years, he carefully inspected thousands of takeoffs and landings, using his eyes like "X-rays" to find every trace of malfunction in the aircraft's belly, head, and wings, such as engine fairings not fastened or locking pins not locked... He would find them and repair them. Because of this, he has long ensured flight safety. This time, their "mechanical inspection" was even more meticulous. Whether it was the electrical wiring as dense as a network of blood vessels or the thousands of large and small parts, each was inspected countless times, and meetings were held until late at night to study whether there were any loopholes. Before the official takeoff, the aircraft was test-flown. Everything was ready, and the aircraft was like a warhorse about to set off on an expedition.

Distinguished guests boarded the plane. Xu Boling followed the instructions of the "control tower" and flew into the clear sky. He showed his skills in this more complex and important stage. The aircraft flew more than one hundred meters per second in the air. However, this young captain also had to manage countless instruments. Airspeed, altitude, direction, and constant communication with the ground. It was truly "watching in all directions and listening to all sides." People always feel a little uncomfortable in the air. In order to ensure the comfort of the distinguished guests, he gently adjusted the altitude and direction to reduce turbulence. He constantly analyzed the changes in the high-altitude atmosphere. When the aircraft flew over Zhengzhou, it suddenly encountered turbulence. Why was this? He quickly identified the secrets of the sky. It turned out that due to the hot weather, a layer of haze rose in the air. The air masses rolled and flowed, and the aircraft shook like a ship sailing in big waves. He pulled up the control stick, and the aircraft slowly climbed higher, flying in a relatively stable wind layer.

Xu Boling learned from his communication with the ground that tens of thousands of welcoming crowds in Beijing had gathered at the airport. Millions of eyes were watching their watches, hoping that the aircraft would land on time. At this time, Xu Boling thought, "I can't miss a single minute." However, with such a high airspeed, and passing through subtropical and temperate zones, the climate was complex and changeable, which would affect the flight time. In order to land accurately, he and the navigator accurately calculated the time from the moment of takeoff, checking the time and correcting the speed every time they saw a landmark. As a result, the aircraft smoothly and accurately arrived in the capital.

For safety, pay attention to cooperation at all times. Once, Xu Boling's aircraft and another aircraft were sending a distinguished guest back to their country. On the way, they suddenly encountered a thunderstorm, and dark clouds seemed like a huge mountain floating in the air, blocking the way. This was a "ferocious enemy." Xu Boling thought that he was the co-pilot and should go ahead to explore the route. This was the first time they had flown this route, and they were unfamiliar with it. He closely contacted the main aircraft while looking for a way out. After flying eighty kilometers, he found a large gap in the clouds, and Xu Boling drilled through it. The dark clouds rolled, and they might suddenly twist together. In the blink of an eye, he had already reported these situations accurately to the main aircraft. The main aircraft flew through the route pointed out by Xu Boling like an arrow.

In order to complete the flight mission, Xu Boling always tried his best to improve the quality of service and overcome numerous difficulties. Once, he flew from Beijing to Irkutsk in the Soviet Union. An international passenger had a recurrence of a heart attack and had difficulty breathing. The crew quickly opened the oxygen cylinder to allow the passenger to breathe oxygen. When the oxygen ran out, the passenger fainted, and his face turned pale. At this very urgent moment, Xu Boling was very calm. He analyzed that this passenger was not used to air travel. "Quickly descend altitude!" After asking for instructions from the ground, he descended six hundred meters, but it still didn't solve the problem. He descended another three hundred meters, descending to the minimum limit. He flew carefully, and the passenger gradually woke up.

The Great Leap Forward in the motherland burned like fire in Xu Boling's heart. He also contributed his strength to the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in his own position. Last summer, when Dingxing County, Hebei Province, was rushing to plant sweet potatoes, they had to transport sweet potato seedlings from distant Hengyang. He knew this was an urgent task. In order to save time, he sometimes took off without even having time to eat. He also motivated the crew to participate in loading and unloading seedlings. Once it rained, and the aircraft stayed overnight in the middle of the journey. He was afraid that the seedlings would be damaged, so he organized everyone to unload them and air them. Although he was very tired every day, he never relaxed.

Communist Party member Xu Boling has been sticking to his post for years, creating outstanding achievements, and has become a red flag for civil aviation pilots in our country. People call him an "air assault expert".

    空中突击手徐柏岭
    徐柏岭当民航飞行员，一晃三年多了。三年来，他飞了三千八百五十三小时，航程一百一十五万五千多公里。这段路好比绕地球赤道三十来个圈圈。他圆满地完成了各项运输任务，特别是在航送党和国家的领导同志以及外宾的一些飞行中，任务完成得更为出色。他飞行技术高，责任心又强。他在一百多万公里的航程中，从没有发生过事故。
    徐柏岭是贫农出身，小时候只上过两年小学。他在党的培育下，在苏联同志的耐心帮助下，祖国的经济建设又像磁石一样吸引着他，于是他很快很快地成了一个优秀飞行员。
    空中生活的最高原则是保证安全。不然，无论在政治上、经济上，都要给国家造成严重损失。保证安全是空勤和地勤人员的共同责任，可是这与机长有着更直接的关系。因而在执行任何一次飞行任务的时候，为了安全，他总费尽心机。去年，领导上让他到国外接贵宾。自然，他知道这是一件十分荣幸的任务，但他又有些踌躇：“我第一次执行这么重要的专机任务，能够完成吗？”领导上猜透他的“心事”，就鼓励他说：“沉着、仔细、依靠群众、搞好协作、周密准备，就能完成任务。”他的心情逐渐平静下来。他把这些指示深深刻在心上。在北京出发以前，大队领导、工程师、党的负责人，都亲自检查了一系列的准备工作。他和同志们到了国外，仍然像绣花那样细致地工作着。他组织大家分析航线上的云朵，航路上的一山一水……希望从中找出一条最好的航线。他组织大家仔细检查飞机。他知道“机械检查”是保证安全的大关口。因此，几年来他仔细地检查了几千个起落，好像“X光”似地把飞机肚子里、脑袋上、翅膀上的一丝丝故障，比如发动机包皮没扣好，插锁没锁好……他都要查找出来进行修理。正因这样，他才长期保证了飞行的安全。这一次他们的“机械检查”更是认真。无论对那密得像血管网一样的电线线路，还是那千千万万的大小零件，都一一检查过无数次，直到夜里还在开会研究有无漏洞。正式起飞以前，又试飞了飞机。一切都准备好，飞机好似就要出征的一匹战马。
    贵宾坐上飞机。徐柏岭按着“塔台”的命令飞向晴空。他在这更加复杂、重要的阶段，大显本领。飞机在空中每秒钟就要飞出一百多米。可是，这位年青的机长还要掌管无数个仪表。航速、高度、方向，还要与地面不断联络。这真是“眼观六路，耳听八方”。飞机到了空中人总有些不舒服。他为了保证贵宾的身体舒适，柔和地修整高度和方向，减轻颠簸。他时刻分析着高空大气的变化。当飞机飞到郑州上空的时候，突然发现颠簸。这是为什么？他很快就辨明了天空的秘密。原来因为天气炎热，空中蒸起了一层霾。大气团滚滚流动，飞机就好像航行在大浪中的船一样颠簸。他拉起操纵杆，飞机徐徐爬高了，到那比较平稳的风层里飞行。
    徐柏岭同地面联络中知道，北京成千上万的欢迎队伍已经齐集飞机场。千万只眼睛都在盯着手表，盼望着飞机准时落地。这时，徐柏岭想：“我可不能错过一点点时间。”可是，这样大的航速，又要经过亚热带和温带，气候复杂多变，这都会影响飞行时间。为了准确落地，他从起飞时就和领航员精确地计算着时间，每见到地标都察看时间并修正速度。结果，飞机顺利准确地到达首都。
    为了安全，要时刻注意协作。一次，徐柏岭的飞机和另一架飞机送一位贵宾回国。路上忽然遇到雷雨，乌云好像一座大山浮在空中阻住去路。这是个“凶恶的敌人”。徐柏岭一想，自己是副机，应该前去探测航路。这条路他们是第一次飞行，路子生疏。他一面和主机紧密联系，一面寻找去路。飞出八十公里以后，发现一条大云缝，徐柏岭钻了过去。乌云滚滚，说不定一下就会绞成一片。说时迟那时快，他已经早把这些情况精确地报告给主机。主机按徐柏岭指给的路子，箭一样地飞过去了。
    徐柏岭为了完成飞行任务，在提高服务质量方面也总是想尽办法，克服重重困难。一次，他从北京飞向苏联依尔库次克。一个国际旅客心脏病复发了，呼吸困难。机组很快打开氧气瓶让旅客吸氧气。氧气吸完了，旅客晕了过去，脸色铁青。正在万分紧急的时候，徐柏岭却很镇静。他分析出这位旅客是不习惯空中生活。“快快下降高度！”他向地面请示以后，下降了六百米，可是还不解决问题。又下降了三百米，下降到最低限度。他小心地飞行，那位旅客渐渐苏醒过来。
    祖国的大跃进，火一般地燃烧着徐柏岭。他在自己的岗位上也为工农业生产大跃进贡献了自己的力量。去年夏天，河北省定兴县抢种红薯时，要从遥远的衡阳去运薯秧。他知道这是一项火急的任务。为了争取时间，他有时连饭都顾不得吃就起飞了。他还带动机组参加装卸秧苗。一次遇雨，飞机在中途过夜，他怕把秧苗闷坏，就组织大家卸下来吹晾。每天虽然很疲倦，可是他毫不松懈。
    共产党员徐柏岭，几年如一日地坚守岗位，创造了优越的成绩，已经成了我国民航飞行员的一面红旗。人们都称他是“空中突击手”。　（旭阳）
