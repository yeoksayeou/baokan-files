Heroic Oil Extraction Stories

    Warm Clothes Thaw, Oil Flows Smoothly
    Dai Shan
    The Lenghu Oilfield was only built last year, and its insulation equipment is relatively poor. In order to produce more crude oil and support the nation's leap forward in industry and agriculture, the oil extraction workers improvised by using car inner tubes filled with hot water to insulate the outside of the wellheads. This required changing the hot water every hour. To produce more oil, the workers cared for the oil wells as if they were looking after children.
    One night, the temperature suddenly dropped to minus twenty degrees Celsius, and the boiler room happened to break down at the same time. Female oil worker Liu Xiue went to fetch hot water but couldn't get any. When she returned to the oil well and listened, the wellhead sounded like it was swallowing something indigestible, gasping for breath, puffing and puffing.
    "The wellhead is waxing up!" Liu Xiue was really anxious. "Petroleum, the blood of industry, what machine can do without it! We must strive to produce more crude oil, without letting go of a single ounce. How can we let it reduce production! No, absolutely not!" As if warning herself, she immediately took off her leather coat and wrapped it tightly around the wellhead.
    Time passed, minute by minute. The waxing wellhead, meeting this very warm leather coat, gradually melted and returned to normal production. Liu Xiue heard the sound of crude oil flowing in the pipeline, and a smile appeared on her face, like a young mother seeing her long-ill baby open its eyes, an infinite comfort welling up in her heart. The cold wind continued to blow, and people in the open-air yard felt as if they were soaked in ice water. However, Liu Xiue didn't seem to have taken off her leather coat, her heart was always warm, listening to the endless flow of crude oil, joyfully flowing until dawn.
    Liu Xiue only left school last year. She passed the first lesson of her life with flying colors. During August and September this year, a high tide of oil extraction was launched throughout the Lenghu Oilfield. New wells were constantly being added, and there were not enough oil extraction personnel. She proposed the suggestion of one person looking after more wells, and diligently studied and figured out a set of well-watching rules, which she promoted throughout the team, forming a movement of frequent inspections and more well-watching. At most, one person looked after seven wells, solving the difficulty of insufficient manpower. In her first year of life, she also attended the National Conference of Heroes.

    暖衣解冻油畅流
    代山
    冷湖油田是去年才建设起来的，保温设备较差。采油工人为了多出原油，支援国家工农业的跃进，就因陋就简地用汽车内胎装上热水，套在油嘴的外边保温。这样，每一小时就要换次热水。为了多出油，工人们真像照管孩子一样照拂着油井。
    一个深夜，气温骤然降到零下二十度，而锅炉房又偏巧在这时候发生了故障。女采油工刘秀娥去装热水没装上，回来时往油井旁一听，井口却像咽下了什么不消化的东西，喘不过气来，噗、噗、噗地直哼。
    “油嘴在结蜡啦！”刘秀娥心里真急得发慌。“石油，工业的血液，那件机器离得了它！必须斤两不让地争取多产原油，怎么能让它减产！不能，绝不能！”她像在警告自己似的，立即从自己身上脱下皮大衣来，紧紧地包在油嘴上。
    时间，一分一刻地过了。正在结蜡的油嘴遇上这件穿得十分暖和了的皮大衣，又渐渐地融化开了，恢复了正常生产。刘秀娥听到油管内奔流的原油声，脸上浮起了微笑，就像一个年轻的母亲看见久病的婴儿睁开了眼睛一样，心底泛起了无限宽慰的喜悦。寒风依旧刮来，人在露天井场上，就像浸在冰水里一样。但是，刘秀娥好像并没有从身上剥下过皮大衣，心里一直是暖融融的，听着奔流不息的原油，欢畅地流到天明。
    刘秀娥去年才离开学校。走向生活的第一课，她是考得满好的。今年8、9月间，整个冷湖油田都掀起了夺油高潮，新井不断增加，采油人员不足，她就提出了一人看多口井的建议，并且刻苦钻研，摸出了一套看井规律，在全队推广，形成一个勤检查、多看井的运动，最多一人看到了七口井，解决了人力不足的困难。她也就在走向生活的第一个年头里，出席了全国群英会。
