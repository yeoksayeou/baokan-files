Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th: Over 70% of the female weavers in the Shanghai textile system have reached expert level. Due to the general improvement of workers' operational skills, textile production has achieved high-speed production increase and a bumper harvest.

The expert competition movement carried out by female textile workers in Shanghai started at the beginning of this year. In order to help weavers quickly master the advanced techniques of the experts, the Shanghai Textile Industry Bureau and the Shanghai Textile Trade Union summarized the experiences of twelve factories and twenty female weavers and promoted them throughout the city. At the same time, more than forty cotton mills in the city were divided into six districts, and mutual aid groups were formed according to the districts. Expert weavers from each factory formed experience exchange teams to perform at each factory. Each factory also took measures according to its own specific situation to organize employees to learn from the experts. At the beginning, State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 used Yang Fuzhen and Lang Fumei as examples for everyone to learn from, but the masses reflected that they could not keep up. After research, the leadership established pacesetters in each type of work, so that the masses could first catch up with the experts in their own workshops, and then catch up with Yang Fuzhen and Lang Fumei. State-owned Cotton Mill No. 9 called on people to learn from Ni Haibao. The elderly workers in Ni Haibao's group said that they were old, their hands and feet were not flexible, and they could not learn. Ni Haibao enlightened these elderly workers, teaching them patiently again and again. The twenty-two female weavers in the group quickly learned Ni Haibao's operating experience in joining shuttles, changing shuttles, and handling stoppages.

The rapid attainment of expert level by a large number of female weavers has guaranteed the continuous leap forward of the city's textile industry. From January to October this year, with no increase in equipment and a decrease in personnel, the city's cumulative cotton yarn output increased by 11.76% compared with the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 16th: The factories under the Shaanxi Provincial Textile Industry Bureau have focused on group work in the competition, which has greatly changed the appearance of production groups. The number of groups that comprehensively and evenly completed the national plan on a ten-day and monthly basis has increased from about 60% to about 80%, and some factories have reached more than 90%. Many groups that had failed to complete the plan for a long time have now entered the ranks of the advanced.

After the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee issued instructions in early September on learning from the three red flag groups of Chen Junde, Cao Guifang, and Kang Yilong, all textile, printing and dyeing, and knitting factories immediately mobilized employees to launch a large-scale competition to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the three red flags. At the same time, the Party committees of each factory carefully inspected the group work, criticized the tendency of some cadres not to pay attention to group work, and formulated standards for measuring the advanced and backward groups, and vigorously cultivated the advanced and helped the backward catch up with the advanced, in light of the specific conditions of their factory. Northwest State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2 also organized advanced groups and advanced producers to "link up" with backward groups and individuals, and launched single-helping and double-helping competitions to provide specific assistance to backward groups or individuals through competitions, so that the advanced became more advanced and the backward caught up with the advanced. Now more than 91% of the groups in the entire factory can comprehensively and overfulfill the national plan, and many groups have caught up with the level of the pacesetter groups.

    赶标兵　帮落后　迅速扩大先进面
    上海纺织系统70％以上的挡车女工达到能手水平
    陕西纺织厂80％的小组全面均衡地完成国家计划
    据新华社上海16日电　上海纺织系统有70％以上的挡车女工，达到了能手水平。由于工人的操作技术普遍提高，使纺织生产实现了高速增产大丰收。
    上海市纺织女工开展的能手竞赛运动，是从今年年初开始的。为了帮助挡车工迅速掌握能手们的先进技术，上海市纺织工业局和上海市纺织工会总结了十二个厂，二十个挡车女工的经验，在全市推广。同时把全市四十多家棉纺厂分成六个区，按区组成互助组，由各厂能手组成经验交流队，到各厂表演。各厂也根据自己厂的具体情况，采取措施组织职工向能手学习。国棉一厂开始时以杨福珍、郎福妹作为大家学习的榜样，群众反映跟不上。领导上研究后就在各工种之间树立标兵，使群众先赶上自己车间能手，再赶杨福珍、郎福妹。国棉九厂号召学习倪海宝，倪海宝小组的老年工人说自己年纪大了，手脚不灵，学不会。倪海宝就来打通这些老年工人的思想，不厌其烦的一遍又一遍地教大家。全组二十二个挡车女工很快就学会了倪海宝的接梭、换梭、处理停台的操作经验。
    大批挡车女工迅速达到能手水平，保证了全市纺织工业不断跃进。今年1月至10月在设备未增加人员有减少的情况下，全市棉纱累计产量比去年同期增长11.76％。
    据新华社西安16日电　陕西省纺织工业局所属各厂，在竞赛中大抓小组工作，使生产小组的面貌大为改观。按旬、按月全面均衡完成国家计划的小组，已由原来的60％左右，上升到80％左右，部分工厂已达到90％以上。许多长期完不成计划的小组，已经跃入先进行列。
    中共陕西省委在今年9月初发出的关于学习陈俊德、曹桂芳、康义隆三个红旗小组的指示后，各纺织、印染、针织厂立即发动职工掀起了声势浩大的学、赶、超三面红旗的竞赛。与此同时，各厂党委认真检查了小组工作，一面批判了部分干部不重视小组工作的倾向，一面结合本厂具体情况，制订了衡量小组先进与落后的标准，大力培养先进和帮助落后赶上先进。西北国棉二厂还组织先进小组、先进生产者同后进小组、个人“挂钩”，展开单帮和双帮赛，通过竞赛对后进小组或个人进行具体帮助，使先进的更加先进，后进的赶上了先进。现在全厂已有91％以上的小组能够全面超额完成国家计划，不少小组已经赶上了标兵组的水平。
