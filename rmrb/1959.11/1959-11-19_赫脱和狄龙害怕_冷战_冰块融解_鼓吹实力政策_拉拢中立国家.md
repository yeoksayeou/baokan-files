Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 18th: U.S. government senior officials have recently been giving speeches, advocating to continue to step up the "Cold War" in Asia, Africa and Latin America. They advocate further using "aid" as bait to carry out economic expansion to the national independent countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. At the same time, they try their best to belittle the prestige of the Soviet Union and China in these countries.

Deputy Undersecretary of State Dillon, in a speech delivered at the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation in Des Moines on the evening of the 17th, emphasized with ulterior motives the importance of Asia, Africa and Latin America to the West. When talking about the international situation where the East wind is prevailing over the West wind, he said with infinite sadness that the "greatest challenge" facing the West in the 1960s will be two things: "The first development is the socio-economic revolution sweeping the vast areas of the free world in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, and the second development is the tremendous development of the Soviet Union in military, industrial and technological fields." Dillon said that the Asian and African countries that gained independence after the war are now committed to seeking economic growth, and in this regard, "the power of the Soviet example is not without effect on the people of the newly developing regions." On the one hand, Dillon viciously slandered the socialist camp, attempting to use this to alienate the relationship between the socialist camp and the national independent countries. On the other hand, he believed that if the West does not try to bring the national independent countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America into the Western orbit, then these countries "will inevitably be tempted to try the shortcut that seems to provide solutions to all their problems" -- the "shortcut" of socialist countries. Dillon worriedly predicted that in this case, the power of the West "will inevitably be lost" and will put itself in a state of "isolation".

Dillon then suggested playing more with the so-called "aid" to Asian, African and Latin American countries to maintain the West's increasingly declining influence. However, considering the United States' serious financial difficulties and huge foreign payment deficit, Dillon reiterated a popular idea of the U.S. ruling group recently, which is to ask Western European countries and Japan to share the U.S.'s "foreign aid" burden and cooperate with the United States in "playing a greater role" in "aiding" Asian and African countries. As for the United States, Dillon said, "We cannot relax our own efforts... because this is not only the greatest challenge of the 1960s, but also the primary issue of the entire second half of the 20th century."

U.S. Secretary of State Herter, in a speech to the National Foreign Trade Association in New York the day before, also asked Western European countries and Japan to share the U.S.'s "foreign aid" burden and asked them to "open the door" for U.S. goods. In explaining this issue, he focused on the fact that last year, the United States had a foreign payment deficit of approximately 3.4 billion U.S. dollars, and it is expected to increase to 4 billion U.S. dollars this year. "Such figures are much larger than the figures of previous years... The United States certainly cannot let them continue indefinitely." Herter said that in order to reduce the U.S.'s foreign payment deficit, this requires "other countries, especially Western Europe and Japan, to take action to open the door for U.S. exports and provide more capital to Asian, African, and Near Eastern and Latin American countries that are eager to develop." Herter asked the United States' "allies" to "aid" Asian, African and Latin American countries through the International Development Association, which is a subsidiary of the International Bank controlled by the United States, and the United States plays a dominant role in the association's various activities.

Herter also talked about the current international situation in his speech. He said that the reality facing the United States today is "a revolutionary movement based on tremendous and growing power" and "the means of mass destruction that envelop this conflict." Considering the strength of the socialist camp and the high tide of the world peace movement, Herter said meaningfully, "The primary issue facing our world today is how to resolve the huge confrontation between political systems in the course of history without breaking out into a thermonuclear war." He said that in this regard, he believes that it is possible to "find a common language" with the Soviet Union "on certain basic points," and "the most likely aspect to find a common language is to set some basic rules for the great competition that dominates our era, that is, to set some 'rules of the game' and limit the competition to the scope stipulated by the conditions of coexistence." But at the same time, Herter also slandered the Soviet Union's policy of peaceful coexistence, saying that he "can certainly expect that all kinds of temptations and pressures will be encountered throughout the free world, the purpose of these temptations and pressures backed by increasing industrial strength is to disrupt, subvert and take over." Herter tried to frustrate the torrent of demands for peace that Khrushchev's visit to the United States caused in the United States, and he clamored, "There is nothing more fatally dangerous than confusing the easing of tensions with relaxing ourselves. One of the most serious dangers in the future is that people will inevitably do so." He said, "We must understand that the life-and-death competition with communism requires all of us to pay energy and benefits... This competition is not a competition between two consistent, but opposite social systems." Herter was still advocating "power politics" at the annual meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Parliamentary Conference on the 17th. He said that the United States does not believe that "the result of (Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman) Khrushchev's visit (to the United States) has eased tensions, so common defense work can be relaxed a little." He reiterated U.S. President Eisenhower's statement that Western countries can only obtain "security" if they have a "firm attitude" and "do not give an inch on principles." Herter emphasized that Eisenhower's words are "equally effective" today. Military preparedness remains "important" to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He said, "The United States will continue to fully support the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." He said that the United States "will continue to bear its due share," and "this policy has not changed."

    赫脱和狄龙害怕“冷战”冰块融解
    鼓吹实力政策　拉拢中立国家
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府高级官员最近不断发表演说，鼓吹要继续加紧在亚非和拉丁美洲地区搞“冷战”。他们主张进一步以“援助”为钓饵向亚非和拉丁美洲的民族独立国家进行经济扩张。同时他们还尽量设法贬低苏联和中国在这些国家的威信。
    副国务卿狄龙17日晚上在得梅因的衣阿华农业局联合会发表的一篇演说中就别有用心地大力强调亚非和拉丁美洲地区对西方的重要性。他在谈到东风日盛、西风日衰的国际局势时无限悲哀地说，西方在六十年代面临的“最大挑战”将有两个：“第一个发展是席卷亚洲、非洲、中东和拉丁美洲的自由世界广大地区的社会—经济革命，第二个发展是苏联在军事上、工业上和技术上的巨大发展。”狄龙说，在战后获得独立的亚非国家现在正致力于谋求经济增长，而在这方面，“苏联的榜样的力量对新发展地区的人民是未尝没有作用的。”狄龙一方面恶毒地诬蔑社会主义阵营，企图借此来离间社会主义阵营同民族独立国家的关系，另一方面他认为，如果西方不是设法使亚非和拉丁美洲民族独立国家纳入西方的轨道，那么这些国家就“一定会情不自禁地试一试似乎能为他们的一切问题提供解决办法的捷径”——社会主义国家的“捷径”。狄龙忧心忡忡地预言，在这种情况下，西方的势力“就一定会失去”，并将使自己处于“孤立”的境地了。
    狄龙于是建议更多地玩弄所谓“援助”亚非和拉丁美洲国家的手段，以维系西方日益衰微的影响。但是考虑到美国严重的财政困难和庞大的对外支付赤字，狄龙重申美国统治集团最近流行的一个主意，就是要西欧国家和日本分担美国的“援外”负担，配合美国在“援助”亚非国家方面“发挥更大的作用”。狄龙说，至于美国，“我们也不能放松我们自己的努力……因为这不仅是六十年代的最大挑战，而且还是二十世纪整个下半叶的首要问题。”
    美国国务卿赫脱前一天在纽约的全国对外贸易协会发表演说时也要求西欧国家和日本分担美国的“对外援助”担子，并要它们为美国商品“敞开大门”。他在解释这个问题时着重谈到在去年，美国的对外支付出现了大约三十四亿美元的赤字，今年预料还将增加到四十亿美元，“这样的数字比以前历年的数字要大得多……美国当然不能让它们无限期地继续下去”。赫脱说，为了减少美国的对外支付赤字，这就要求“其他国家、特别是西欧和日本采取行动，为美国的出口敞开大门，并向亚洲、非洲以及近东和拉丁美洲的渴望发展的国家提供更多的资本。”赫脱要求美国的“盟国”通过国际开发协会来对亚非和拉丁美洲国家进行“援助”，而这个协会正是美国控制的国际银行的一个附属机构，美国对协会的各种活动是起着支配作用的。
    赫脱在演说中还谈到当前的国际形势。他说，美国今天面临的现实是“一个以巨大的日益增长的力量为基础的革命运动”以及“笼罩着这场冲突的大规模毁灭手段”。考虑到社会主义阵营的强大，世界和平运动的高涨，赫脱意味深长地说，“今天我们世界所面临的首要问题是怎样在历史进程中解决政治制度之间的巨大的对抗，而不爆发成为热核战争。”他说，在这方面，他认为在“某些基本点上”是能够同苏联“找到一种共同的语言的”，而“最有可能找到共同语言的一个方面是为支配着我们的时代的大竞争订下一些基本规则，即订下某种‘比赛规则’，而把竞赛限制在共同生存条件所规定的范围以内。”但是赫脱同时又诬蔑苏联的和平共处政策，说什么他“肯定能料想到自由世界各地将遭到各种各样的诱惑和压力，这些以日益增强的工业力量为后盾的诱惑和压力的目的是扰乱、颠复和接管”。赫脱力图挫折由于赫鲁晓夫访问美国而在美国引起的要求和平的洪流，他叫嚷说，“没有东西比把缓和紧张局势同放松我们自己这两回事混淆在一起具有更致命的危险了，今后最严重的危险之一就是人们会情不自禁地这样做。”他说，“我们必须了解到，同共产主义进行生死攸关的竞赛需要我们大家付出精力和利益……这种竞赛不是两种一致的，而是相反的社会制度之间的竞赛”。赫脱17日在北大西洋公约组织议员会议的年会上还在鼓吹“实力政策”，他说，美国并不认为，“（苏联部长会议主席）赫鲁晓夫访问（美国的）结果缓和了紧张局势，因此可以把共同防务工作放松一些。”他重申美国总统艾森豪威尔的说法，就是所谓西方国家只有“态度坚定”，“在原则上寸土不让”，才能得到“安全”。赫脱着重指出，艾森豪威尔这些话今天“同样有效”。军事准备对北大西洋公约国家的“重要性依然未变”。他说，“美国将继续全部支持北大西洋公约组织”，他说，美国“将继续承担应有的份额”，“这种政策没有改变”。
