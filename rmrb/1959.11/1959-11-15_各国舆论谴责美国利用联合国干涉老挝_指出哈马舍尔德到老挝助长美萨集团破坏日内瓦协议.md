Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 13th: "Laos Patriotic News" published an article on November 8th stating that UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's visit to Laos this time is of no benefit to the peaceful resolution of the Laotian issue. On the contrary, it has fueled the conspiracy of American interventionists and their running dogs to undermine the Geneva Accords and obstruct the resumption of activities by the International Commission for Laos.

The article stated, "The only way to resolve the Laotian issue is for the Royal Lao Government to strictly abide by the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, stop the civil war, stop U.S. imperialist interference in Laos, restore the freedom of patriotic individuals who are being imprisoned, and hold peaceful negotiations with the people's forces to achieve a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos."

The article emphasized that in order to achieve all of this, it is necessary to restore the activities of the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos, and first and foremost, a conference of participating countries in the 1954 Geneva Conference must be convened.

The article stated, "The intention to station a permanent UN body in Laos is essentially to exclude the organizations established under the Geneva Accords, making it impossible to implement this agreement. We firmly oppose UN interference in Laos."

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 14th: "Soviet Naval News" today published a commentary on the Laotian situation, stating that the official reaction of the United States to the report of the UN Security Council's "Sub-Committee to Investigate the Laotian Situation" shows that the U.S. State Department has not abandoned its attempt to permanently seize Laos and turn it into a springboard for a new war.

The commentary stated that the Sananikone government and the UN Security Council's "Sub-Committee to Investigate the Laotian Situation" have exhausted all their efforts but have not been able to find the non-existent so-called "aggression" from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. U.S. State Department spokesman White hurriedly issued a statement, insisting that although the "Sub-Committee's" report did not find "aggression," it did not rule out the possibility of such "aggression."

The commentary stated that Washington is actively formulating new plans for military measures, which raises the question: Who are these preparations aimed against? From whom exactly do the "philanthropists" across the ocean want to "save" the Laotian people?

The commentary concluded that the step of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld going to Laos is strange. His hasty visit can only be explained as an attempt to cover up the unsavory acts of imperialism in Indochina.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 14th: "People's Daily" today published a commentary on the UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's illegal interference in the Laotian situation in Vientiane, saying, "The U.S. imperialist bloc is conspiring to set up a permanent UN agency in Laos, which, like the establishment of the 'Sub-Committee to Investigate the Laotian Situation,' is illegal."

The commentary stated, "It can be asserted that stationing a permanent UN representative in Laos will only benefit the U.S. imperialist warmongers in continuing to intensify interference in Laos under the guise of the UN and turn Laos into a U.S. military base." The commentary emphasized, "No matter what form the UN uses to interfere in Laos, it will not solve the Laotian problem, but will instead make the Laotian situation more complicated."

The commentary stated, "Everyone knows that the report of the 'Sub-Committee to Investigate the Laotian Situation' was unable to confirm the slander of the U.S. imperialists and pro-American reactionaries in the Laotian government regarding the so-called 'aggression by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.'" The commentary pointed out, "After this despicable slander went bankrupt, the masterminds who fabricated the slander and those who used the UN to cover up their illegal acts of creating tension in Laos should have been prosecuted. UN interference in the Laotian issue should have been stopped, and a correct and effective solution to the Laotian issue should have been found in accordance with the Geneva Accords. However, under the pressure of U.S. imperialism, the U.S. imperialist bloc countries in the UN are still stubbornly moving towards a dead end."

The commentary forcefully refuted the remarks made by Hammarskjöld when he arrived in Laos on November 12th. The commentary stated that Hammarskjöld's words and deeds fueled the U.S.-Sananikone group's violations of the Geneva Accords on Laos. The commentary pointed out that it is clear that the UN's action of sending representatives to Laos will inevitably lead to dangerous consequences.

The commentary concluded, "The facts in Laos prove that there is no second way to normalize the Laotian situation other than strictly implementing the Geneva Accords on Laos and restoring the activities of the International Commission for Laos."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 14th: "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today stating that Hammarskjöld's remarks in Laos on the 12th, interfering in the Laotian situation, are an abuse of his authority as UN Secretary-General and a direct assistance to the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords on Laos.

The commentary stated that the illegally established UN "Sub-Committee to Investigate the Laotian Situation" had to admit that the so-called "aggression from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam" fabricated by the U.S.-Sananikone group was completely a lie. So, the UN should now immediately dissolve this committee and admit its shameful mistake. Regardless of all this, Hammarskjöld's speech after arriving in Laos can only be considered as an attempt to shield the U.S. imperialists, whose criminal conspiracy in Laos has been exposed, in the name of the UN Secretary-General.

    各国舆论谴责美国利用联合国干涉老挝
    指出哈马舍尔德到老挝助长美萨集团破坏日内瓦协议
    据新华社河内13日电　“老挝爱国新闻”11月8日发表文章说，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德这次来到老挝，对和平解决老挝问题毫无裨益，反而助长了美国干涉者及其走狗破坏日内瓦协议和阻挠老挝国际委员会恢复活动的阴谋。
    文章说，“解决老挝问题的唯一途径，是老挝王国政府必须严格履行日内瓦协议和万象协议，停止内战，制止美帝国主义对老挝的干涉，恢复正被监禁的爱国者的自由，同人民力量举行和平谈判，以实现和平中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝。”
    文章强调指出，为了实现这一切，必须恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动，而首先是，必须召开1954年日内瓦会议参加国会议。
    文章说，“要在老挝派驻联合国常设机构的意图，实质上是要排斥日内瓦协议所规定设立的组织，促使这个协议无法实现。我们坚决反对联合国干涉老挝。”
    据新华社莫斯科14日电　“苏联海军报”今天就老挝局势发表评论说，美国对联合国安全理事会“调查老挝局势小组委员会”调查报告的官方反应表明，美国国务院没有放弃把老挝永远攫为己有和把老挝变成新战争跳板的企图。
    评论说，萨纳尼空政府和联合国安全理事会“调查老挝局势小组委员会”用尽一切力量，也发现不了根本不存在的所谓来自越南民主共和国的“侵略”的事实。美国国务院发言人怀特就急忙发表声明，硬说“小组委员会”的报告虽然没有发现“侵略”，但并没有排除这种“侵略”的可能性。
    评论说，华盛顿正在积极制订新的军事措施计划，这就产生一个问题：这些准备是用来反对谁呢？大洋彼岸的“慈善家”们究竟要把老挝人民从什么人的手里“拯救”出来呢？
    评论最后说，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德到老挝去这一步骤令人感到奇怪。他的仓促访问只能说明是企图掩盖帝国主义在印度支那的见不得人的行径。
    据新华社河内14日电　“人民报”今天就联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德到万象进行非法干涉老挝局势的活动发表评论说，“美帝国主义集团正在阴谋设立联合国驻老挝的常设机构，这和成立‘老挝局势调查小组委员会’一样是非法的。”
    评论说，“可以肯定，在老挝设置联合国常驻代表，只有利于美帝国主义好战分子打着联合国的幌子继续加紧干涉老挝，把老挝变成美国的军事基地。”评论强调指出，“不管联合国用什么形式来干涉老挝，都解决不了老挝问题，反而促使老挝局势更加复杂化。”
    评论说，“大家都知道，‘老挝局势调查小组委员会’的报告没有能够证实美帝国主义和老挝政府中亲美反动分子关于所谓‘越南民主共和国在老挝的侵略’的污蔑”。评论指出，“这种卑鄙的污蔑破产之后，本来应当控告制造污蔑事件的主谋者和那些利用联合国来掩护他们制造老挝紧张局势的非法行为的人，本来应当停止联合国对老挝问题的干涉，按照日内瓦协议规定的那样，为老挝问题找出正确有效的解决措施。可是，在美帝国主义的压力下，联合国中的美帝国主义集团国家仍然执迷不悟地朝着死胡同里走。”
    评论有力地驳斥了哈马舍尔德11月12日到达老挝时发表的谈话。评论说，哈马舍尔德这种言行助长了美国—萨纳尼空集团违反关于老挝的日内瓦协议的行为。评论指出，显然，联合国向老挝派驻代表的行为必然会引起危险的后果。
    评论最后说，“老挝的事实证明，除了严格履行关于老挝的日内瓦协议和恢复老挝国际委员会的活动之外，再没有能够使老挝局势正常化的第二条道路。”
    据新华社平壤14日电　“劳动新闻”今天发表评论说，哈马舍尔德12日在老挝发表干涉老挝局势的谈话，是滥用他联合国秘书长的职权，直接协助美帝国主义破坏关于老挝的日内瓦协议的阴谋活动。
    评论说，非法成立的联合国的“调查老挝局势小组委员会”不得不承认美国—萨纳尼空集团所制造的所谓“来自越南民主共和国的侵略”完全是谎言。那么，联合国现在就应该立即解散这个委员会，承认可耻的错误。哈马舍尔德却不顾这一切，他到老挝后的讲话只能被人们认为是要以联合国秘书长的名义包庇在老挝的犯罪阴谋被暴露了的美帝国主义者。
