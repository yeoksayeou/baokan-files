    The Increasingly Weakening Position of the United States in the Capitalist Market
    Soviet Union Zakhmatov

    In the past year and a half to two years, international economic relations in the capitalist world have been constantly changing, and the position of the United States in the world capitalist market has been increasingly weakened.

    Although the economic crisis of overproduction in the United States from 1957 to 1958 sharply exacerbated sales problems in the domestic market, American monopolies were not only unable to expand exports during this period, but also failed to prevent the decline in exports. US exports in 1958 decreased by 14% compared to 1957, from $20.9 billion to $17.9 billion. This was the largest decrease in export volume among capitalist countries in 1958, accounting for 65% of the total decrease in exports in the capitalist world in 1958.

    In 1958, exports decreased by 14%, while imports decreased very little, less than 2% in value. Moreover, it is worth noting that imports of manufactured industrial products increased by 11%, of which transportation equipment and vehicles increased by 34%. In the past, imports of foreign manufactured goods competing with American products always decreased first, and to the greatest extent.

    In 1959, US exports continued to decline. Exports from January to May 1959 decreased by 5.5% compared to the same period in 1958, while imports from January to April increased by 14.7% compared to the same period in 1958.

    Due to the weakening of the United States' international economic position, new contrasting relationships of power between capitalist countries have emerged in the world market, and Western European countries and Japan have strengthened their competition with American monopolies. As a result, the exports of the United States' competitors have increased greatly. For example, in 1958, West Germany's total equipment exports increased by 7%, including automobiles by 22%, machine tools and rolling equipment by 20%, and water pump compression equipment by 13%. French equipment exports increased by 23%, and Italy by 16%.

    Britain, West Germany, France, Japan, and Italy have greatly squeezed out the United States in the finished product market. West Germany significantly expanded its export volume of these commodities and ranked second, only after the United States. The United States' automobile exports have been pushed from first to fifth place, behind West Germany, Britain, France, and Italy.

    Fierce competition is taking place in the Western European markets, which account for 45.2% of the world's capitalist imports. As a result of this competition, the United States is being squeezed out of the Western European market. US exports to Western Europe decreased by 19% in 1958, while West Germany's exports to this region expanded.

    A sharp struggle to seize the Latin American market is also underway, but the United States' position in this region is also constantly deteriorating. In 1958, US exports to Latin American countries decreased by 11%, while West Germany's and especially Italy's exports increased by 10%. Japan's exports to Latin America increased by 32%.

    Competitors are squeezing out US exporters in the Canadian market and in Asian and African countries. In 1958, US exports to Canada decreased by 13%, exports to Asia decreased by 21%, and exports to Africa decreased by 10%. However, exports from Britain, West Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Japan to Canada increased. West Germany and Italy greatly increased their exports to Asia, and exports from Britain, West Germany, France, and Italy to Africa also grew rapidly.

    Due to the competitors' offensive, the United States' share of world capitalist exports fell to 18.6% in 1958, compared to 21.0% in 1957 and 32% in 1947 (the highest level after the war).

    The decline in the United States' share of world capitalist exports is closely related to changes in the United States' position in world capitalist production. In the past decade, the United States' share of industrial production in capitalist countries has decreased from 56.2% to 46.4%.

    The United States has increasingly lost the advantageous position it held in the initial post-war years, when it was virtually the sole supplier in the world capitalist market; and used this position to sell goods at high prices in foreign markets. At present, the goods exported by the United States' Western European competitors and Japan are cheaper and better than American goods.

    The goods sold by the United States' competitors in foreign markets and in the United States are 15% to 50% cheaper than American goods. For example, several machine tools sold by Western European countries in foreign markets (including the United States) are priced 50% lower than those from the United States. West German metal wire sells in the United States for forty dollars less per ton than American wire, and Japanese steel is twenty to thirty dollars cheaper per ton than American steel.

    The high price of American products (especially when competition occurs in the domestic market in the United States) is caused by the monopoly pricing policy. American monopolies set prices based on a predetermined high profit rate. Even in the event of crises, production reductions, and significantly underutilized production capacity, this pricing policy guarantees that monopolies obtain high profits and promote price increases.

    Unprecedented state expenditures (reaching $81 billion in the 1958-1959 fiscal year, almost eighteen times the pre-war level of 1932) and huge budget deficits (approximately $13 billion) also stimulate price increases.

    High prices in the domestic market inevitably affect the export prices of the United States. However, American monopolies on the one hand sell goods at very high monopoly prices, and on the other hand engage in large-scale dumping in foreign markets. Of course, this dumping is basically subsidized by state budget funds. The prices at which goods are sold (the total value of goods sold in 1958-1959 has decreased) are often much higher than domestic prices, especially the prices of equipment sold to underdeveloped countries.

    If the government's expenditures for "aid" and maintaining US troops stationed abroad were more or less offset by a large commercial surplus (the surplus in 1957 was $6.1 billion), then in 1958, while these government expenditures continued to expand, the commercial surplus decreased by nearly 50%, to $3.3 billion.

    The United States' imports did not decrease significantly (calculated by value; if calculated by physical volume, imports increased somewhat), but commercial exports decreased greatly, which resulted in a huge deficit in the United States' international balance of payments, amounting to $3.4 billion in 1958.

    In 1959, the situation of the United States' international balance of payments continued to deteriorate. In the first four months of 1959, the trade surplus (excluding military supplies) decreased by two-thirds compared to the same period in 1958, amounting to only $393 million.

    A very significant phenomenon appeared in 1958 and 1959, which proves the weakening of the dollar's position in international settlements and is greatly reflected in bourgeois economic writings. This is the large outflow of gold from the United States. The United States' gold reserves decreased by $2.6 billion in 1958 and the first five months of 1959, and are currently approximately $20.2 billion, which is the lowest level in the post-war era, $4.4 billion less than the highest level in 1949.

    Foreigners reject the dollar and exchange it for gold because of distrust in the dollar, as the British "Economist" wrote, because the "dollar is worthless". The US ruling group once tried to portray the dollar as the most stable currency, and the currencies of other countries were dependent on the dollar; some even tried to see it as a measure of the value of gold; but today, the dollar is constantly losing its position. Wall Street's publication "The Wall Street Journal" was also forced to admit that if prices in the United States continue to rise at this rate, then the purchasing power of the dollar will soon be reduced by another 25% compared to pre-war levels. At that time, as the "Pick's World Currency Report" ridiculed, the dollar will "not be a dollar, but a copper penny". Foreigners holding dollars are unwilling to keep these depreciating dollars and want to exchange their dollar reserves for gold.

    Among a series of reasons leading to the outflow of gold from the United States, it should be pointed out that the 1957-1958 economic crisis that hit the United States showed foreigners holding dollars and US securities that their investments in the United States were in danger. They believed that gold would be their most reliable investment. At the same time, it was also disadvantageous for the US government to deposit or hold short-term bonds in Federal Reserve dollar accounts, because the discount rate determining deposit interest rates and security interest rates decreased to 1.75% in the United States in May 1958. In Western European countries (that is, the main holders of foreign investment in the United States), the discount rate during this period was as follows: 5.5% in the United Kingdom, 3.5% in West Germany, and 5% in France. Moreover, the price of gold in London was higher than the price forcibly maintained by the United States, so it was profitable to sell US gold in the United Kingdom.

    Some business people in capitalist countries, in view of the devaluation of the dollar, demanded that the price of gold be increased, that is, that the dollar be legally devalued. Disregarding the strong opposition of US government officials, bourgeois economic publications regularly and repeatedly reported news about the US government suggesting the implementation of a legal devaluation of the dollar. Foreign countries strive for legal devaluation and prepare to deal with legal devaluation, thus throwing out dollars and government securities and exchanging their capital for gold.

    Some Western European economists believe that the existing price of gold should be doubled. The weakening of the dollar's position has dealt a major blow to New York's position as the financial center of the capitalist world.

    At the request of large monopolies, US government agencies have begun to specifically study the competitiveness of US goods in foreign markets.

    American financial capitalists are trying to lower the prices of American goods and improve their competitiveness, but the methods they are adopting are not to reduce the profits of monopolies, but to increase labor intensity, freeze wages, and strengthen state encouragement of export trade. To this end, the "First National City Bank" blatantly clamored: "In order to maintain its position in the export market and maintain confidence in the dollar, the United States should prevent the spiral of rising prices and wages… Congress should discuss large-scale business issues less and pay more attention to our country's industrial capacity… Maintain America's position in the competitive world. To do this, we can only rely on the government's assistance and the workers' sympathy." All other representatives of American financial oligarchs also clamor for such measures.

    The uproar raised by the US press about the competitiveness of US goods is also aimed at defending the US's protectionist tariff policy of strengthening tariff rates. "Business Week" blatantly hinted at this not long ago, pointing out: "If gold continues to flow out, then it is very likely that Congress will take some measures to reduce imports."

    The US Tariff Commission received a large number of letters from US companies requesting strengthened tariff protection policies. In 1958 and the beginning of 1959, mandatory restrictions were implemented on imports of oil and petroleum products, voluntary restrictions were abolished, import quotas were implemented on lead and zinc, and restrictions on wool imports were restored.

    However, continuing to intensify the implementation of protectionist tariff policies is likely to cause most capitalist countries to exert pressure on US exports, which will cause a more brutal trade war and cause US export volumes to decline.

    Some American financial oligarch groups have imposed an arms race on Western European countries and forced them to use more and more funds for the arms race, attempting to weaken the position of their competitors. However, "Business Week" added on this issue: "The question is whether our allies agree to risk their normal economic development to obtain expensive military equipment, and perhaps they will also reduce their military power."

    Another reason against reducing US foreign "aid" is that reducing "aid" will also greatly reduce exports. As "Business Week" once wrote: "Any reduction in foreign aid will immediately reduce exports accordingly."

    Therefore, the United States has always taken the most resolute measures, intensifying exports by various methods such as state subsidies, dumping, and private capital exports. In 1957-1958, state expenditures for "aid" (that is, the main form of state-subsidized exports) amounted to $5 billion, 7% more than in 1956-1957. In 1958, the Economic Development Loan Fund (plus appropriations of $700 million) was put into use, and this loan was used to help the United States export goods and export capital to underdeveloped countries. In the summer of 1958, in order to expand national export credit, the authorities passed a law on expanding the lending limit of the Import-Export Bank by $2 billion (to $7 billion). The US Congress strived to strengthen the foreign dumping of agricultural "surplus materials," and extended Law 480 to December 31, 1959, and expanded the sales limit for non-freely convertible foreign currencies from $4 billion to $6.25 billion. In order to compete for new markets, American monopolies have also tried every means to intensify the export of private capital, and the amount of private capital exported in 1958 was $2.9 billion. However, a large increase in capital exports will expand the deficit in the international balance of payments. The expansion of state-subsidized export expenditures will also have the same effect.

    Of course, the United States still continues to occupy a dominant position in the world capitalist market. In terms of total export volume, the United States still has much more than other capitalist countries, and is still the largest exporter of industrial products. The United States' share of world capitalist exports has increased by 50% compared to before the war. The United States still holds about 50.6% of the total gold reserves of capitalist countries.

    In the past year and a half to two years, obvious and serious changes have taken place in the United States' international economic position, which proves that the unevenness of capitalist development is constantly intensifying. These changes reflect the increasingly weakening position of the United States in the world capitalist relations system. The United States' competitors are not only striving to restore their own positions in the world capitalist market, but also squeezing out the United States. The struggle between imperialists for sales markets is entering a new stage.

    美国在资本主义市场上的地位日益削弱
    苏联  扎赫马托夫
    最近一年半到两年以来，资本主义世界的国际经济关系不断起着变化，美国在世界资本主义市场上的地位日益削弱。
    虽然1957年到1958年美国生产过剩经济危机使得国内市场上的销售问题急剧尖锐化，但美国垄断组织在这一时期中不仅没有能够扩大出口，而且也未能阻止出口的减少。美国1958年的出口额比1957年降低了14％，即从二百零九亿美元降到一百七十九亿美元。这是1958年资本主义世界各国出口额降低得最多的国家，占1958年资本主义世界出口总额减少部分的65％。
    1958年，出口额下降了14％，而进口额却下降得很少，按其价值来说，还不到2％。而且值得注意的是工业制成品的进口量增长了11％，其中运输设备和运输工具增长了34％。而过去，同美国产品竞争的外国制成品进口量总是首先下降，而且下降的程度最显著。
    1959年，美国出口仍在继续下降。1959年1至5月的出口量比1958年同期减少了5.5％，而1至4月的进口量却比1958年同期增长了14.7％。
    由于美国国际经济地位的削弱，在世界市场上资本主义国家的力量出现了新的对比关系，西欧各国和日本加强了同美国垄断组织的竞争。而美国的竞争对手的出口却因此大增。例如，1958年西德设备出口总额增加了7％，其中汽车增加了22％，机床和轧钢设备增加了20％，水泵压缩设备增加了13％。法国设备出口增加了23％，意大利增加了16％。
    英国、西德、法国、日本和意大利在成品市场上大大地排挤了美国。西德显著地扩大了这些商品的出口量，而且居于第二位，仅次于美国。美国的小汽车出口量已由第一位被排挤到第五位，落在西德、英国、法国和意大利之后。
    残酷的竞争正在西欧各个市场上激烈地进行，西欧市场占世界资本主义进口的45.2％。这场竞争的结果，是美国被排挤出西欧市场。美国1958年对西欧的出口下降了19％，而西德对这一地区的出口却扩大了。
    争夺拉丁美洲市场的尖锐斗争也正在进行，然而美国在这个区域的地位也在不断恶化。1958年美国对拉丁美洲各国的出口减少了11％，而西德、特别是意大利的出口却都扩大了10％。日本对拉丁美洲的出口增长了32％。
    竞争者在加拿大市场以及亚非国家排挤着美国出口商。1958年美国对加拿大的出口减少了13％，对亚洲的出口减少了21％，对非洲的出口减少了10％。然而英国、西德、法国、荷兰和日本对加拿大的出口则增加了。西德和意大利大大增加了对亚洲的出口，英国、西德、法国和意大利对非洲的出口也增长得很快。
    由于竞争者的进攻，美国1958年在世界资本主义出口中的比重下降到18.6％，而它在1957年为21.0％，1947年为32％（即战后最高水平）。
    美国在世界资本主义出口中所占比重的下降，是同美国在世界资本主义生产中地位的变化密切相联的。近十年来，美国在资本主义国家工业生产中的比重从56.2％下降到46.4％。
    美国已经越来越丧失它在战后最初年代所拥有的优越地位，当时它实际上是世界资本主义市场上唯一的供应者；并且利用了这种地位在国外市场高价出售商品。而目前，美国的西欧竞争对手和日本所出口的商品比美国商品更为价廉物美。
    美国的竞争对手在国外市场和在美国所出售的商品比美国商品便宜15％—50％。例如，西欧国家在国外市场（其中包括在美国）出售的几种机床，其价格比美国低50％。西德在美国出售的金属丝每吨价格比美国的便宜四十美元，日本钢每吨比美国的便宜二十至三十美元。
    美国产品的价格很高（特别是当美国国内市场上发生竞争的时候），这是垄断价格政策所造成的。美国垄断组织规定价格是以早已确定的高额利润率为依据。甚至在危机、生产缩减和生产能力开工很不足的情况下，这种价格政策也能保证垄断组织获得高额利润和促使价格上涨。
    国家开支空前扩大（1958—1959财政年度达八百一十亿美元，几乎为战前1932年的十八倍），预算赤字庞大（约为一百三十亿美元），这也刺激价格的上涨。
    国内市场的高昂价格不可能不影响到美国的出口价格。然而美国垄断组织一方面按照很高的垄断价格出售商品，同时又在国外市场进行大量倾销。当然，这种倾销基本上是依靠国家预算资金的资助来进行的。商品出售（1958—1959年商品出售总额已减少）价格往往比国内高得多，尤其是卖给不发达国家的设备的价格特别高。
    如果说，过去政府用于“援助”和维持驻外美军的开支或多或少是用大量的商业出超（1957年出超数额为六十一亿美元）来弥补的话，那么1958年，在这些政府开支不断扩大的同时，商业出超将近减少了50％，即减到三十三亿美元。
    美国的进口缩减不大（系按价值计算，若按实物量计算，则进口有所增加），而商业出口却大为缩减，这使得美国国际支付平衡中出现庞大的赤字，1958年为三十四亿美元。
    1959年美国国际支付平衡的情况继续恶化。1959年头4个月中，贸易平衡的顺差（不包括军事供应）比1958年同时期减少了三分之二，仅为三亿九千三百万美元。
    1958和1959年出现了一种非常有意义的现象，这种现象证明美元在国际结算中地位的削弱，并且在资产阶级的经济著作中得到了很大的反映。这就是美国的黄金大量外流。美国1958年和1959年头五个月的黄金储备减少了二十六亿美元，目前约为二百零二亿美元，即为战后年代的最低水平，比最高的1949年少四十四亿美元。
    外国人其所以排斥美元并且把美元兑换成黄金，是由于人们对美元不信任，如英国“经济学家”周刊所写的，由于“美元不值钱”。美国统治集团曾经企图把美元描绘成为最稳定的货币，其他国家的货币也依附于美元，甚至有人企图把它看成是衡量黄金价值的尺度；而今天，美元正在不断丧失自己的阵地。华尔街的机关刊物“华尔街杂志”也被迫承认，如果美国的物价继续以这种速度不断上涨，那么美元的购买力即将比战前再缩减25％。那时，正如“皮克世界货币报告”中所讥讽的，美元将“不是美元，而是铜板了”。持有美元的外国人不愿意保存这种贬值的美元，要把自己的美元储备换成黄金。
    在一系列导致美国黄金外流的原因中，应该指出的是，打击美国的1957—1958年经济危机向持有美元和美国有价证券的外国人表明：他们在美国的投资正遭到危险。他们认为，黄金将是他们最可靠的投资。同时，美国政府在联邦银行美元账户上存款或者保存短期债券也是不利的，因为确定存款利率和有价证券利率的贴现率，1958年5月，在美国下降为1.75％。而在西欧国家（即在美国的外国投资的主要所有者），这一时期的贴现率如下：英国为5.5％，西德为3.5％，法国为5％。而且伦敦的黄金价格高于美国所强行维持的价格，所以在英国出卖美国黄金是有利可图的。
    某些资本主义国家工商界人士鉴于美元贬值而要求提高黄金的价格，即实行美元的法定贬值。资产阶级的经济报刊不顾美国政府官员的坚决反对，经常定期地反复报道关于美国政府建议实行美元法定贬值的消息。外国力求争取法定贬值，并且准备去对付法定贬值，因之就抛出美元和政府有价证券，并且把自己的资本换成黄金。
    某些西欧经济学家认为应该把现有的黄金价格提高一倍。美元地位的削弱，使纽约作为资本主义世界金融中心的地位受到重大的打击。
    根据大垄断组织的要求，美国政府机关已经开始专门研究美国商品在国外市场上的竞争能力的问题。
    美国金融资本家力图降低美国商品的价格并且提高它的竞争能力，然而他们所采用的办法不是降低垄断组织的利润，而是提高劳动强度和冻结工资加强国家对出口贸易的鼓励。为此，“第一花旗银行”公报露骨地叫嚷：“为了保持自己在出口市场上的阵地和维持对美元的信任，美国应当防止价格和工资的螺旋式上升……国会应该少讨论一些大规模生意的问题，多关心一下我国的工业能力……保住美国在竞争的世界上的阵地。要做到这一点，就只有靠政府的协助和工人的同情。”美国其他的一切金融寡头代表也叫嚷采取这类措施。
    美国报刊围绕美国商品竞争能力掀起的叫嚣，目的还在于为美国加强关税率制度的保护关税政策作辩护。“商业周刊”不久前露骨地暗示了这一点，它指出：“如果黄金继续外流，那么，国会采取一些措施来削减进口是十分可能的。”
    美国关税委员会接到美国公司大批要求加强关税保护政策的意见书。1958年和1959年年初，石油和石油制品进口方面实行了强制的限制，废除了自愿的限制，对铅和锌实行了进口限额，并且恢复了对羊毛进口的限制。
    然而继续加紧推行保护关税政策很可能引起大多数资本主义国家对美国的出口施加压力，而这将引起更加残酷的贸易战和使美国出口量下降。
    美国某些金融寡头集团把军备竞赛强加于西欧国家，并强迫它们把越来越多的资金用于军备竞赛，企图以此削弱其竞争对手的地位。不过，“商业周刊”就这一问题补充说：“问题在于我们的同盟国是否同意拿自己正常发展的经济去冒险而获取昂贵的军事装备，也许它们还会缩减自己的军事力量。”
    反对减少美国对外“援助”的另一个理由是，减少“援助”还会使出口大大缩减。正如“商业周刊”曾经写道：“对外援助的任何缩减都会使出口即刻相应地减少”。
    因此，美国假借国家资助、倾销和私人资本输出的各种不同方法，一向采取最坚决的措施，加紧出口。1957—1958年，国家用于“援助”的开支（即国家资助出口的主要形式）为五十亿美元，比1956—1957年多7％。1958年，已经开始动用经济发展借款基金（加上拨款为七亿美元），这笔借款是用来帮助美国向不发达国家出口商品和输出资本的。1958年夏季，为了扩大国家的出口信贷，当局通过了一项关于扩大进出口银行借贷限额二十亿美元（增至七十亿美元）的法律。美国国会力图加强农业“剩余物资”的对外倾销，便把第四百八十号法延长到1959年12月31日，并且把不能自由兑换的外币的销售限额从四十亿美元扩大到六十二亿五千万美元。为了争夺新的市场，美国垄断组织还千方百计地加紧输出私人资本，1958年私人资本输出额为二十九亿美元。然而资本输出的大量增加会使国际支付平衡中的赤字扩大。国家资助出口的开支的扩大也将产生同样的影响。
    当然，美国在世界资本主义市场上仍然继续占据着优势。按出口总额来说，美国仍比其他资本主义国家多得多，还是最大的一个工业产品出口国。美国在世界资本主义出口中的比重比战前增加了50％。美国仍然掌握着资本主义国家黄金储备总额的50.6％左右。
    最近一年半到两年以来，美国国际经济地位显然发生了严重的变化，这证明资本主义发展的不平衡性正在不断加剧。这些变化反映出美国在世界资本主义关系体系中的地位日趋削弱。美国的竞争对手不仅力求恢复本国在世界资本主义市场上的地位，而且还排挤着美国。帝国主义争夺销售市场的斗争正在进入一个新的阶段。
