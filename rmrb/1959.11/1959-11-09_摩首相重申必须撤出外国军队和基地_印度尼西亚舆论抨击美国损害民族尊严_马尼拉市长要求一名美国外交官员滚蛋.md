Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, November 6th: The Moroccan newspaper "Liberation" today published an interview with Moroccan Prime Minister Ibrahim by the newspaper's reporter. The Prime Minister said, "Postponing the withdrawal of French and Spanish troops stationed in Morocco will weaken our friendship with these two countries." He also reiterated that the U.S. government should withdraw its bases in Morocco.

Prime Minister Ibrahim said that cooperation between the United States and Morocco is only possible when relations between the two countries are based on respect for Moroccan sovereignty, non-subordination, and the principles of peaceful cooperation.

Referring to his impressions of his visit to the United States, the Prime Minister said that he had talks with Texas oil entrepreneurs and other business figures. He said, "Unfortunately, Americans know nothing about Morocco."

Comprehensive report from this newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency: At the invitation of the Indonesian naval authorities, Frederick Kivette, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, arrived in Jakarta on November 2 aboard the heavy cruiser "St. Paul."

Prior to Kivette's arrival in Jakarta, the "American Women's Association" of Jakarta sent "invitations" to some Indonesian female college students, inviting them to attend a "dance party" scheduled for November 4 on the Seventh Fleet warship to "entertain" the American sailors on board. This "invitation" aroused strong condemnation from the Indonesian public. The Central Committee of the Indonesian Women's Movement Association issued a statement pointing out that this so-called "invitation" would lead to moral corruption and stain Indonesian national dignity. After discussion, the Indonesian Parliament's Education and Culture Group announced that its members unanimously opposed this "invitation" from the Jakarta "American Women's Association." Indonesian Deputy Minister of Information, Maradi, also stated that this "invitation" violated Indonesian customs and morals.

U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Jones, was forced to announce on the 2nd the cancellation of the "dance party" scheduled for the 4th to "entertain" the American warship sailors. However, Jones, in a fit of pique, insisted that the Indonesian public opposing the "entertainment" of American sailors intentionally "insinuated" and "slandered." This talk interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs aroused even greater anger and protest from Indonesian public opinion. The "Dawn Daily" published an editorial warning the commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet not to "carry out covert activities" in Indonesia. The editorial said that the weapons airdropped to Indonesian rebels were "made in the United States," and the pilots who carried out these airdrops were also Americans. The captured American pilot Allen Pope is proof of this. Some members of the Indonesian parliament demanded the immediate trial of the captured American pilot Allen Pope. Wedoyo, a member of the Indonesian Parliament's Defense Group, gave a speech on the 3rd, demanding that Pope be tried immediately and sentenced to death.

Xinhua News Agency, November 6th: Manila News: According to the "Manila Daily Bulletin," the Mayor of Manila demanded on November 2 that an unreasonable American diplomatic personnel be immediately expelled.

As previously reported, Sheridan Ashley, a diplomatic courier from the U.S. Embassy, crashed a car into a taxi on the 1st. He injured a Filipino pedestrian with an empty wine bottle and tried to run over another young man with the car. Nearby Filipino residents were outraged and seized him and beat him up. A local police patrol car passed the scene and took the American to the police station. This American, described by the police as "arrogant and overbearing," pushed away the investigators and cursed the interrogating police officer with foul language.

Manila Mayor Arsenio Lacson strongly protested to the U.S. Embassy about the arrogance and hostility of this diplomatic courier. He warned that if such a thing happened again, the municipal authorities would severely punish it. At the same time, Lacson instructed the police department: "Any American diplomatic personnel who insult Filipinos and Filipino police, whether or not they enjoy diplomatic immunity, will be detained."

In a letter to the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the U.S. Embassy, and the U.S. State Department, the Mayor pointed out that this ill-behaved American diplomat insulted Filipinos as "mongrels."

The colonial attitude adopted by Americans in the Philippines towards Filipinos has aroused widespread anger among Filipinos.

    摩首相重申必须撤出外国军队和基地
    印度尼西亚舆论抨击美国损害民族尊严
    马尼拉市长要求一名美国外交官员滚蛋
    新华社拉巴特6日电　摩“解放报”今天刊载了摩洛哥首相易卜拉欣答该报记者问。这位首相说，“推迟撤出法国和西班牙在摩洛哥的驻军，将削弱我们同这两个国家的友谊”。他还重申，美国政府应该撤出它在摩洛哥的基地。
    易卜拉欣首相说，只有两国之间的关系建立在尊重摩洛哥主权和不从属于人并且进行和平合作原则的基础之上的时候，美国和摩洛哥的合作才有可能。
    谈到他访问美国的观感时，这位首相说，他同美国得克萨斯州石油企业家以及其它企业界人士进行了交谈。他说，“不幸的是，美国人对摩洛哥一无所知”。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国第七舰队司令弗雷德里克·基维特应印度尼西亚海军当局的邀请，于11月2日乘“圣保罗号”重巡洋舰到达雅加达。
    在基维特到达雅加达前夕，雅加达的“美国妇女协会”向印度尼西亚的一些女大学生发出“邀请”，要她们参加预定11月4日在第七舰队军舰上举行的“跳舞晚会”，“招待”舰上的美国水兵。这个“邀请”引起了印度尼西亚公众的强烈谴责。印度尼西亚妇女运动协会中央委员会发表声明指出，这种所谓“邀请”会引起道德败坏和沾污印度尼西亚民族尊严的事情。印度尼西亚国会教育文化小组经过讨论后宣布，它的成员一致反对雅加达“美国妇女协会”的这种“邀请”。印度尼西亚情报部副部长马拉迪也表示，这种“邀请”是违反印度尼西亚的风俗习惯和道德的。
    美国驻印度尼西亚大使琼斯在2日被迫宣布取消订于4日举行“招待”美国军舰水兵的“跳舞晚会”。但琼斯恼羞成怒地硬说，反对“招待”美国水兵的印度尼西亚公众有意“影射”和“诽谤”。这个干涉印度尼西亚内政的谈话，更激起了印度尼西亚舆论界的愤怒和抗议。“黎明日报”发表社论，还警告美国第七舰队司令不要在印度尼西亚“进行隐蔽的活动”。社论说，向印度尼西亚叛乱分子空投的武器都是“美国制造的”，而进行这种空投的飞行员也是美国人。被俘的美国飞行员艾伦·波普就是一个证明。印度尼西亚国会的一些议员要求立即审判被俘的美国飞行员艾伦·波普。印度尼西亚国会国防小组委员韦多约在3日发表谈话，要求立即对波普进行审判，并且处他以死刑。
    新华社6日讯　马尼拉消息：据“马尼拉日报”报道，马尼拉市长在11月2日要求立即把一个蛮横无理的美国外交人员驱逐出境。
    前已报道，美国大使馆的外交信使谢里登·艾希利1日驾驶汽车撞坏了一辆出租汽车，他用一只空酒瓶打伤一个菲律宾行人，并且还想用车去撞另外一个青年人，附近的菲律宾居民大为愤怒，把他抓起来痛打一顿。当地警察的机动车经过出事地点，把美国人带到警察局里去。这个被警察称为“态度蛮横和傲慢自大”的美国人用手推开调查人，并且用不入耳的话咒骂讯问他的警察。
    马尼拉市长阿塞尼奥·拉克森向美国大使馆强烈抗议这个外交信使的傲慢和敌对的态度。他警告说，如果再发生这样的事，市政当局将予严办。同时，拉克森指示警察部门：“凡侮辱菲律宾人和菲律宾警察的美国外交人员，不论是否享有外交豁免权，一概加以拘留”。
    这位市长在给菲律宾外交部、美国大使馆和美国国务院的信中指出，这个行为不端的美国外交官辱骂菲律宾人是“杂种”。
    在菲律宾的美国人对菲律宾人摆出一种殖民主的态度，这已经引起菲律宾人广泛的愤怒。
