Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 20th: The 10th Congress of the Cuban Workers' Confederation continued yesterday afternoon, during which the report of David Salvador, the general head of the Executive Committee, was adopted.

The report condemned the aggressive plans and actions of U.S. imperialism and expressed firm support for the Cuban revolutionary government headed by Castro. The report suggested: Condemning the U.S. government's aggression against Cuba and obstruction of Cuba's purchase of aircraft. At this point, all the representatives stood up and cheered enthusiastically.

All the representatives also stood up and applauded enthusiastically, expressing their approval of the recommendation made by the reporter to withdraw from the Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers (ORIT).

The reporter argued that ORIT is a yellow trade union and an agent of the imperialists. He pointed out that this organization harbored Muehlemann elements and trade unions serving dictatorial regimes within its ranks. When Cuba was attacked and bombed, this organization did not help support Cuba. It also acted as a tool for imperialist invasion and division of the masses, with the aim of keeping Latin American brothers in a state of backwardness, uncivilization, and poverty.

The reporter emphasized the help of the working class to the farmers and the government in implementing land reform, and affirmed the unconditional support of the working class for this measure.

He condemned the intensified counter-revolutionary activities, condemned the deceptive propaganda of domestic and foreign reactionary press represented by Jules Dubois, and condemned the invasion of Cuban territory by pirate planes from the United States. He pointed out that in the face of these facts, Cuban workers should remain vigilant to prevent Batista's henchmen from sabotaging public utilities and sugar mills, and to crush attempts by American newspapers and old Muehlemann elements to incite unnecessary strikes.

The reporter emphasized the importance of national unity and receiving military training to defend the revolution.

The congress approved the previous decision to suspend unnecessary strikes for six months, and decided to suspend such strikes in 1960 as well; approved the decision of the working class to donate one day's wage to purchase defense aircraft; paid tribute to the "patriotic initiative" of sugar workers to contribute 4% of their income to support national industrialization from January 1st next year, and universally extended this voluntary donation to workers in other industries; suggested that the revolutionary government stipulate profit limits for factory owners and industrialists; helped the government implement plans to build housing for farmers; increased the minimum wage; revised labor contracts implemented since the dictatorial regime, and adopted measures to immediately improve the situation of 600,000 unemployed workers.

A fraternal delegation sent by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union attended the meeting. They were invited by the Cuban Workers' Confederation to participate in the congress and arrived in Cuba yesterday.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 20th: Lombardo Toledano, president of the Latin American Labor Federation, said at the 10th Congress of the Cuban Workers' Confederation last night, "If anyone invades Cuba, an international workers' column will come to defend Cuba together." He said this was not boasting, but he deeply understood the feelings of the people of various countries.

He said that Cuba is now the focus of attention of the people of all Latin American countries. Cuba is carrying out an anti-feudal and anti-imperialist democratic revolution.

Lombardo Toledano emphasized that the Cuban revolution is precisely at a time when the struggles of Asia and Africa for independence are in full swing, the camp of peace and socialism is increasingly consolidated, and international tensions are easing. No one wants war. The people of all countries want peace.

Giuseppe Casadei, Secretary of the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), who was invited to attend the congress, congratulated the 10th Congress of the Cuban Workers' Confederation on behalf of the 95 million members of the WFTU. He said that these members enthusiastically watched the heroic struggle of the Cuban people for independence and freedom.

Casadei emphasized that the world's workers support Cuba's struggle, not only for Cuba's benefit, but also because this struggle is part of the overall struggle for peace, independence, and democracy.

Casadei finally expressed the hope to strengthen the fraternal relations between the two workers' organizations and to continuously exchange experiences.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 21st: The Cuban Cabinet meeting last night passed a law stipulating that the five tribunals that currently have the power to try counter-revolutionary crimes are the revolutionary tribunals that were reinstated at the end of October, and announced the cessation of the functions of ordinary courts in trying counter-revolutionary crimes. This is a concrete measure taken after the Cuban government decided to reinstate the revolutionary tribunals at the end of October.

The law stipulates that the trials and lawsuits against counter-revolutionary crimes that have begun or are about to begin will be decided immediately, and stipulates that the Minister of Revolutionary Armed Forces will appoint the members of the revolutionary tribunals within 7 days after the promulgation of the law.

The law waived the right to temporary freedom enjoyed by those suspected of committing counter-revolutionary crimes.

    托列达诺等在古巴工人代表大会上发言
    国际工人阶级支持古巴
    古巴政府决定恢复五个革命法庭审判反革命罪行
    据新华社哈瓦那20日电　古巴工人联合会第十次代表大会昨天下午继续举行会议，在会上通过了执行委员会总负责人戴维·萨尔瓦多的报告。
    报告谴责了美帝国主义的侵略计划和行动，并表示坚决支持以卡斯特罗为首的古巴革命政府。报告建议：对美国政府侵略古巴和阻挠古巴购买飞机的行动提出谴责。这时，全体代表一致起立，并且热烈欢呼。
    全体代表也一致起立热烈鼓掌欢呼，表示赞同报告人提出的关于退出美洲区域工人组织的建议。
    报告人认为，美洲区域工人组织是黄色工会，是帝国主义者的代理人。他指出，这个组织收留了穆哈耳分子和为独裁政权效劳的工会在它的内部。当古巴遭到袭击和轰炸时，这个组织没有帮助支持古巴的运动。它并且充当了帝国主义入侵和分裂群众的工具，目的是使拉丁美洲弟兄仍然处在落后、不文明和贫困的状态中。
    报告人强调指出了工人阶级在实行土地改革中对农民和政府的帮助，肯定了工人阶级对这个措施的无条件的支持。
    他谴责了变本加厉的反革命活动，谴责了以朱耳斯·杜波依斯为代表的国内外反动报界的欺骗宣传和来自美国的海盗飞机对古巴领土的侵略。他指出，面对这些事实，古巴工人应当保持警惕，以防止巴蒂斯塔特务帮凶破坏公用事业和糖厂，并粉碎美国报纸和老穆哈耳分子煽动不必要的罢工的企图。
    报告人强调全国人民的团结和接受军事训练来保卫革命的重要性。
    大会批准过去所做的关于停止不必要的罢工六个月的决定，并决定1960年也停止这类罢工；批准工人阶级捐献一天工资购买国防飞机的决定；向糖业工人关于从明年1月1日起拿出4％的收入支援国家工业化的“爱国倡议”致敬，并把这种自愿捐献普遍扩大到其他行业的工人中去；建议革命政府规定厂主和工业家的利润限度；帮助政府执行关于建筑农民住房的计划；增加最低的工资；修改从独裁政权时就实行的劳工合同，采取措施立即改善六十万失业工人的处境。
    出席这次会议的有全苏工会中央理事会派遣的兄弟代表团，他们是应古巴工人联合会的邀请来参加代表大会，在昨天抵达古巴的。
    据新华社哈瓦那20日电　拉丁美洲劳工联盟主席隆巴多·托列达诺昨晚在古巴工人联合会第十次代表大会上说，“假如有人侵犯古巴，那末一支国际工人纵队将来一同保卫古巴”。他说这并不是说大话，而是他深知各国人民的心情。
    他说，古巴现在是拉丁美洲各国人民的注意中心。古巴正在进行反封建和反帝国主义的民主革命。
    隆巴多·托列达诺强调说，古巴革命正是在亚非争取独立的斗争火热进行以及和平和社会主义阵营日益巩固，国际紧张局势日趋缓和的时候取得胜利的。任何人都不要战争。各国人民都要和平。
    应邀参加大会的世界工联书记处书记朱塞佩·卡萨迪代表世界工联的九千五百万会员向古巴工人联合会第十次代表大会祝贺。他说，这些会员热情地注视着古巴人民争取独立和自由的英勇斗争。
    卡萨迪强调指出，世界工人支持古巴的斗争，这不仅是为了古巴的利益，而且因为这个斗争是争取和平、独立和民主的总斗争的一部分。
    卡萨迪最后表示希望加强两个工人组织的兄弟关系和不断交流经验。
    新华社哈瓦那21日电　古巴内阁会议昨晚通过一项法律，规定现在有权审判反革命罪行的五个法庭是10月底恢复的革命法庭，并且宣布停止普通法庭审判反革命罪行的职能。这是10月底古巴政府决定恢复革命法庭后所采取的具体措施。
    法律规定，已经开始或正要开始的对反革命罪行的审判和诉讼案将立即裁决，并且规定革命武装部长在法律颁布后7日内任命革命法庭的组成人员。
    法律免除了犯有反革命罪行嫌疑的人可享暂时自由的权利。
