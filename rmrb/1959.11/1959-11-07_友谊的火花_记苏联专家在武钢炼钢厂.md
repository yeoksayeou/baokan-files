    Sparks of Friendship – Remembering Soviet Experts at the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation Steelmaking Plant
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Yuan Zheping
    In the newly operational steelmaking plant of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO), one can often hear people, with passionate language, discussing the friendly assistance provided by Soviet experts. You will find that whether workers, engineering technicians, or cadres, they deeply love the Soviet friends who live and work with them day and night. This is not accidental, because every achievement of this factory, from construction to production, shines with the sparks of Sino-Soviet friendship.
    The builders of the steelmaking plant unforgettably talk about Soviet experts Polisin, Mikhayev, and Rodin, praising their contributions in solving the most critical problem of the steelmaking plant – the foundation of the open-hearth furnace main building.
    In February and March of last year, before the steelmaking plant had even started construction, it encountered a difficult problem: how to reinforce the foundation of the open-hearth furnace main building. This was to be a world-class large-scale steelmaking plant, with the main building entirely of steel structure, and the foundation of such a building had to be able to withstand enormous pressure. However, the site of the open-hearth furnace main building was originally a low-lying area with soft soil, with only half the pressure resistance required by the design, and it had to be reinforced. Finding a reinforcement plan that was technically reliable, economically reasonable, and guaranteed engineering quality was a problem that urgently needed to be solved. Just as everyone was repeatedly researching and unable to make up their minds, three Soviet experts, led by soil mechanics expert Polisin, came to WISCO. They tirelessly went to the site several times a day to conduct field tests. Polisin, an old man who lost a leg in the Soviet Patriotic War, ignored the difficulty of walking and worked and studied intensively with everyone, sometimes in the office and sometimes at the construction site. They compared and studied various schemes, examined the experimental data of sand pile compaction and crushed stone cushion, and studied the various types of soil and the influence of temperature on the foundation of various parts of the open-hearth furnace. They kept drawing diagrams, studying them again and again, not knowing how much mental and physical labor they put in, and finally came to the conclusion: using cheaper crushed stone cushion instead of sand cushion was technically and quality-wise guaranteed; under certain conditions, crushed stone cushion was even superior to sand cushion. But the experts were not satisfied and, based on their rich experience in making sand cushions, creatively developed the crushed stone cushion into a sand-frame crushed stone cushion, that is, laying a layer of sand between the crushed stone and the clay to prevent the crushed stone from moving horizontally with the surrounding soil, further enhancing the stability of the foundation. The solution of this problem created extremely favorable conditions for the construction of the steelmaking plant and was a significant contribution to the high-speed construction and operation of the No. 1 and No. 2 open-hearth furnaces.
    The selfless working spirit of steelmaking expert Telyosin is moving. He often sacrificed rest time for work, to complete his assigned work as soon as possible. Once in May and June of this year, Telyosin had just returned from a business trip to Taiyuan when his wife fell ill. When Xu Hongyi, the director of the steelmaking plant, visited the patient at his home, he advised him: "The work in the plant is not too busy now, you should stay at home for a few more days to take care of your wife and children!" But he couldn't stay away, and two days later, even though his wife was not well, he returned to the plant. Others asked him: "Why did you come? Is your wife better? Who is taking care of the children?" He replied: "The children have been entrusted to others to take care of them. I have to hurry up and make the production regulations so that they can be handed over to the workers for discussion." After he finished speaking, he buried himself in his work. In less than two days, he had sorted out a thick stack of regulations, adding seven opinions that were not originally there.
    Telyosin is not a construction engineer, but a steelmaking expert. However, he is not only concerned about production work, but also about the construction of the project. In the open-hearth furnace construction site, from the hundred-meter-high chimney to the slag chamber and regenerator buried seven or eight meters underground, his footprints were everywhere. When he saw any problems with the quality of the project, he would kindly offer suggestions to the construction workers and help them find ways to improve.
    Soviet experts paid great attention to using every opportunity to pass on their technical experience to the workers and technicians of WISCO, helping them to grow rapidly. In addition to giving systematic technical experience transfer reports, Soviet experts often went to the site to give demonstration performances, sometimes even teaching hand-in-hand until the Chinese workers fully understood. Among the open-hearth furnace workers, there are many moving stories of expert Kaschenko's enthusiastic help to Chinese workers. This expert, who had been a steelworker for twenty years, was very experienced. Since the open-hearth furnace was put into production, he went to the furnace almost every day, put on blue glasses and white canvas gloves, and participated in the actual operation with the Chinese workers. Charging, combining magnesia cement, bricklaying, slag removal, he did everything; when he saw that the Chinese workers were not operating well, he helped to improve it at any time. Steelworker Su Weilin of No. 1 open-hearth furnace was transferred from Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation and was responsible for the work of the taphole. He also did this work in Anshan, but that was a tilting open-hearth furnace, which was different from the fixed open-hearth furnace here, so in the first few days of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace being put into production, he always found it difficult to work. Once, after the steel was tapped, the inner mouth of the taphole was still very large, like a trumpet, so Su Weilin sealed the taphole with magnesia. Kaschenko, an experienced expert, felt that something was wrong as soon as he saw it, and immediately picked up the hook and bent down to dig it out, and found that the upper part of the inner mouth was empty, and the magnesia that was blocked had flowed down. He immediately saw that Su Weilin was not familiar with this kind of furnace, so he said to Su: "You squat here and watch, I'll do it for you!" He put on his gloves and braved the high temperature to gently scoop out half of the magnesia with a hook, then sealed the upper part of the inner mouth with magnesia cement, and then sealed the taphole. After finishing the treatment, he kindly asked Su Weilin: "Do you understand?" Su Weilin said gratefully: "I understand how to do it, but I don't understand why to do it this way." So, the expert used a small iron plate as a blackboard and lime as chalk in front of the furnace to give a detailed explanation to Su Weilin and other Chinese workers, systematically explaining the function, significance and method of handling the taphole. In the early stage of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace being put into production, the taphole could only be used two or three times, but after his help, it could be used eight or nine times. Because the taphole was handled well, this furnace never leaked steel.

    友谊的火花——记苏联专家在武钢炼钢厂
    新华社记者　袁者萍
    在新近投入生产的武钢炼钢厂里，你常常可以听到人们用充满激情的语言，谈论着苏联专家给予他们的友谊帮助；你会发现，无论是工人、工程技术人员或干部，都深深地热爱着和他们朝夕相处的苏联朋友们。这不是偶然的，因为这个工厂从建设到开工生产，每一项成就都闪耀着中苏友谊的火花。
    炼钢厂的建设者们念念不忘地谈到苏联专家波利申、米赫也夫、罗金，赞扬他们在解决炼钢厂最关键的问题——平炉主厂房地基问题的过程中所建立的功勋。
    去年2、3月间，炼钢厂还没有开工建设就遇到一个难题：怎样加固平炉主厂房地基。这里要建设世界第一流的大型炼钢厂，主厂房全部是钢结构，这种厂房的地基必须能够承受巨大的压力。可是，平炉主厂房的厂址原是一片土质松软的低洼地，耐压力只有设计要求的一半，必须设法加固。怎样寻找出一个技术上可靠、经济上合理、工程质量又有保证的加固方案，这是一个急待解决的问题。正当大家反复研究，拿不定主意的时候，以土力学家波利申为首的三位苏联专家来到了武钢。他们不辞辛劳地一天数次到现场作野外试验。波利申，这位在苏联卫国战争中失掉了一条腿的老人，不顾行走的艰难，一会儿在办公室，一会儿又到工地，和大家一起紧张地劳动着，钻研着。他们对各种方案作了比较研究，察看了砂桩加密和碎石垫层的试验资料，研究了土壤的各种类型和平炉各部分温度对基础的影响。他们不断地画着图，研究了又研究，不知付出了多少脑力的和体力的劳动，终于最后得出结论：采用价格便宜的碎石垫层代替砂垫层，在技术上和工程质量上都是有保证的；在某种条件下，碎石垫层还优于砂垫层。但专家们还不满足，又根据他们作砂垫层的丰富经验，创造性地把碎石垫层发展成为砂框碎石垫层，即在碎石和粘土之间铺一层砂子，使碎石和四周土壤不能作水平移动，进一步地增强了基础的稳定性。这个问题的解决，给炼钢厂的建设创造了极为有利的条件，对一、二号平炉高速度地建成和投入生产，是一项有重大意义的贡献。
    炼钢专家捷辽申忘我的工作精神是令人感动的。他常常为工作牺牲休息时间，尽快地完成自己担负的工作。今年5、6月间，有一次捷辽申刚从太原出差回来，他爱人病倒了。炼钢厂厂长许鸿翼到他家里看望病人时劝他说：“厂里工作现在不太忙，你就在家里多耽几天，照顾照顾爱人和孩子吧！”可是他耽不住，两天后，尽管爱人病还未好，就回到厂里去了。别人问他：“你怎么就来了？爱人好了吗？孩子谁照顾？”他回答说：“孩子已托给别人照管了。我得赶快把生产规程作出来，好交给工人讨论。”说完后，就埋头工作起来了。不两天，他已把厚厚一叠规程逐条地整理出来，还添上了原来没有的七条意见。
    捷辽申并不是建筑工艺师，而是炼钢专家。可是，他不但关心生产工作，而且也很关心工程的施工。在平炉工地，上至百米高的烟囱，下至埋入地下七、八米深的沉渣室、蓄热室，到处都有他的足迹。当他看到工程质量方面有什么问题时，就和蔼地向建筑职工提出建议，帮助他们设法改进。
    苏联专家们很注意利用一切机会，把自己的技术经验传授给武钢的工人和技术人员，帮助他们迅速地成长。苏联专家们除了作系统的技术经验传授报告外，还常常到现场作示范表演，有时候甚至把着手教，直到中国工人完全明白为止。在平炉工人中间，传颂着卡斯钦柯专家热心帮助中国工人的许多感人的故事。这个干过二十年炼钢工人的专家经验非常丰富。自平炉投入生产后，他几乎每天都要到炉上去，戴上蓝色眼镜和白帆布的手套，和中国工人一起，参加实际操作。加料、合镁火泥、砌砖、扒渣，什么都干；看到中国工人操作不好，他就随时帮助改进。一号平炉炼钢工人苏维林是从鞍钢调来的，负责出钢口的工作。在鞍钢时，他也是作这个工作的，可是那是倾动式平炉，和这里的固定式平炉不同，所以，在一号平炉投入生产的头几天里，他工作起来总不顺手。有一次，才出完钢，出钢口的里口还很大，像喇叭似的，苏维林就用镁砂把钢口封死了。经验丰富的卡斯钦柯一看，觉得情况不对，随即拿起钩子弯下腰来掏，发现里口上部都是空的，堵上的镁砂都流下来了。他立即看出了苏维林还不熟悉这种炉子，就对苏说：“你蹲在这儿看，我给你干一下！”他把手套一戴，就冒着高温用钩子轻轻地把镁砂掏出一半来，再用镁火泥把里口的上部封满，然后再封死出钢口。处理完后，他和蔼地问苏维林：“看懂没有？”苏维林感激地说：“怎样干看懂了，为什么这样干还没有懂。”于是，专家就在炉子前面用小铁板当黑板，石灰当粉笔，向苏维林和其他中国工人作了详细的解释，系统地说明了处理出钢口的作用、意义和方法。一号平炉投入生产的初期，出钢口只能利用两三次，经过他的帮助，可以利用八、九次了。因为出钢口处理得好，这个炉子从来没有漏过钢。
