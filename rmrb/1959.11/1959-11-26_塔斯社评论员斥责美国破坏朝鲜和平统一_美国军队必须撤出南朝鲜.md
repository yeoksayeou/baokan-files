Xinhua News Agency, November 25th dispatch from Moscow: TASS commentator Khalikov commented on November 24th on the discussion of the Korean issue by the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, condemning the United States for its plot to undermine a peaceful solution to the issue of Korean reunification.

He wrote that the Korean issue has remained on the agenda of the United Nations for twelve years. As one of the current pressing issues, it remains unresolved. Korea is still divided by the 38th parallel, suffering the tragic consequences of national division. The continued tension in this region certainly does not contribute to strengthening peace in the Far East.

The commentator pointed out that the reason for this phenomenon is the attempt by certain countries, primarily the United States, to force others to accept a solution to the Korean issue that violates the interests of the Korean people themselves and the interests of peace in the Far East, and to use the Korean issue to achieve their own political goals.

The author continued, even at this session of the United Nations General Assembly, the United States wants to cling to its past course on the Korean issue. This can be seen from the fact that the discussion on the Korean issue is still based on the report of the so-called "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea," as in the past. We know that this commission was established in October 1950, and its purpose was obviously to justify the acts of aggression in Korea. Since then, this commission has been a tool in the hands of those who oppose Korean national unification. Each of its "annual reports" distorts the reality in Korea and glorifies American policy. The report submitted by the commission this time is no exception.

The author emphasized that in order for the Korean issue to be resolved fairly and reasonably through peaceful means, it must begin with the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea. The presence of foreign troops in South Korea creates an excuse for interference in internal affairs and hinders Koreans from reaching an agreement on the gradual rapprochement between the North and the South. The author emphasized that the United States military cannot find even a formal justification for its continued presence in South Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers have completely withdrawn from North Korea for more than a year. However, American troops remain on Korean territory. Who can believe the claim by the U.S. Command that the 38th parallel, almost ten thousand kilometers away from the United States, is "America's defense line"? The author said that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea is an urgent requirement today, and it is a basic prerequisite for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.

The author concluded by writing that, however, as the initial stages of the discussion of the Korean issue at this session of the United Nations General Assembly have shown, the United States is unwilling to take this only reasonable path in the current situation. The U.S. delegation forced the Political Committee to pass a resolution denying North Korean representatives the right to participate in the discussion of the Korean issue. This kind of decision is an attempt to dictate terms, an attempt to impose one's will on the residents of North Korea. Those who take such an attempt only show that they are unwilling to see Korean unification and development under conditions of peace and progress.

### 塔斯社评论员斥责美国破坏朝鲜和平统一  美国军队必须撤出南朝鲜

    塔斯社评论员斥责美国破坏朝鲜和平统一
    美国军队必须撤出南朝鲜
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：塔斯社评论员哈里科夫24日就联合国大会政治委员会讨论朝鲜问题发表评论，斥责美国破坏和平解决朝鲜统一问题的阴谋。
    他写道，朝鲜问题十二年来一直没有离开过联合国的议程。作为当前的迫切问题之一，它仍然没有得到解决。朝鲜仍然被三八线割裂开来，经受着民族分裂的悲惨后果。使这个地区的局势继续紧张，这当然不会有助于加强远东的和平。
    评论员指出，造成这种现象的原因是某些国家，首先是美国企图强迫别人接受用违背朝鲜人民本身利益和违背远东和平利益的办法来解决朝鲜问题，企图利用朝鲜问题来达到自己的政治目的。
    作者继续写道，就在联合国大会本届会议上，美国还想死守它过去在朝鲜问题上的路线。关于这一点，哪怕从下面的事实中也可以看出来：关于朝鲜问题的讨论仍然像过去那样是以所谓“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会”的报告作为基础的。我们知道，这个委员会是1950年10月成立的，它的目的显然是为在朝鲜的侵略行为进行辩护。从那时起，这个委员会就一直是反对朝鲜民族统一的那伙人的手中的工具。它的每一个“年度报告”都对朝鲜国内的现实加以歪曲，而美化美国的政策。委员会这次提出的报告也是如此。
    作者强调说，为了使朝鲜问题通过和平途径而得到公正合理的解决，必须从外国军队撤出南朝鲜开始。外国军队驻在南朝鲜就为干涉内政制造了借口，阻碍着朝鲜人自己就北部和南部的逐步接近达成协议。作者着重指出，美国军队找不到即使是形式上的理由来作为它继续驻留南朝鲜的根据。中国人民志愿军从北朝鲜完全撤退，已经一年多了。而美国军队仍然留在朝鲜领土上。美国司令部硬说离美国几乎一万公里的三八线是“美国的防御线”，这谁能相信呢？作者说，美军撤出南朝鲜，这是今天的迫切要求，这是和平解决朝鲜问题的基本前提。
    作者最后写道，然而，如联合国大会本届会议讨论朝鲜问题的初期情形所表明的，美国不愿意走这条在当前情况下唯一合理的道路。美国代表团强使政治委员会通过了一项决议，拒绝北朝鲜代表参加讨论朝鲜问题的权利。这种决定是企图发号施令，是企图把别人的意志强加在北朝鲜居民的身上。而采取这种企图的人只表明他们不愿看到朝鲜统一和在和平进步的条件下发展。
