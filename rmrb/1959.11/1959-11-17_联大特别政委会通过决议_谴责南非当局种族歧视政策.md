The UN Special Political Committee passed a resolution on November 10 condemning the racial discrimination policy implemented by the Union of South Africa.

The committee adopted the resolution by a vote of sixty-seven to three (with seven abstentions). Britain, France, and Portugal voted against it.

This is the eighth consecutive year that the committee has condemned South Africa's policy of racial discrimination. In the past seven years, Asian-African countries and socialist countries have continuously condemned the apartheid policy pursued by the government of the Union of South Africa in the United Nations General Assembly and its committees, believing that this policy is a crude violation of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms and is incompatible with the United Nations Charter and the Declaration of Human Rights.

    联大特别政委会通过决议
    谴责南非当局种族歧视政策
    本报讯　联合国大会特别政治委员会11月10日通过谴责南非联邦执行种族歧视政策的决议。
    委员会以六十七票对三票（七票弃权）通过上述决议。英国、法国和葡萄牙投票反对。
    这是这个委员会连续第八年谴责南非的种族歧视政策。在过去的七年中，亚非国家和社会主义国家曾不断在联合国大会和它的委员会上谴责南非联邦政府所奉行的种族隔离政策，认为这种政策是对人的起码权利和基本自由的粗暴的破坏，是同联合国宪章和人权宣言不相容的。
