Building a Farm in Three Years, a Wasteland Transformed into Paradise
Introducing the Deeds of the State-Owned 853 Farm

	The 853 Farm is located north of the Wanda Mountains in Heilongjiang Province, on the periphery of the Mishan Reclamation Area. It has a total land area of 4.65 million mu, of which arable land accounts for about one-third. The water system is mainly the Naodao River, composed of the Hamatong River, the Qilixing River, and the Xiaoqing River.
	After the construction of water conservancy projects, the irrigated area can reach 750,000 mu, and it can also generate electricity and be navigable. The soil here is fertile, and the terrain is relatively flat, suitable for planting crops such as wheat, soybeans, and corn. The geographical conditions provide sufficient natural conditions for building a modern state-owned farm here.
	The 853 Farm was established in early November 1956. The main members were composed of demobilized officers and soldiers from the Railway Corps, with 2,100 employees. At that time, there were no houses and no cultivated land, just a vast wasteland. Under the leadership of the Party and with the strong support of the whole country, in just three years from the establishment of the reclamation point to the present, seven agricultural branch farms (including one experimental branch farm), a medium-sized livestock farm, a forestry branch farm, and a capital construction team have been established. The farm has a total of 37 agricultural production teams, 7 livestock production teams, 5 sideline production teams, 4 forestry teams, and 13 capital construction teams. The total number of employees has increased to 14,534. There are now 88 tractors (equivalent to 228 standard units), 29 combines, 640 various agricultural implements, 53 trucks, 250 kilowatts of power generation equipment, and the cultivated area has reached 450,000 mu. The more than 358,000 mu of crops sown this year have achieved good harvests. According to actual measurements, the total output of grain crops this year is more than 8,000 tons, an increase of 230.1% compared with 1958.
	Large-scale livestock production began in 1958. In 1957, there were only 132 pigs for consumption. At the end of 1958, the number of pigs reached 2,781, chickens 3,648, and ducks 912. On this basis, in order to realize a greater leap forward in animal husbandry, the livestock personnel carried out ideological and organizational rectification, trained 267 technical personnel, implemented a full-time responsibility system for livestock personnel, and promoted advanced experience in egg production, hatching, and chick rearing for chickens and ducks, piglet production and survival, and horse breeding, conception, and survival, so that livestock production achieved rapid development. Comparing January to August of this year with the entire year of 1958, the number of pigs increased by one and a half times, chickens increased by five times, ducks increased by 2.2 times, and the survival rate of pigs reached 85%, with an average of 8.5 piglets surviving per litter. The types of livestock management have also increased from four in 1957 to ten.
	In terms of basic construction, the principle of serving production, using local materials, adapting to local conditions, and making do with whatever is available was resolutely implemented. From the establishment of the farm to the end of this year, the total area of basic construction completed and about to be completed by the farm will be nearly 200,000 square meters. While agriculture and animal husbandry have developed, industrial and sideline diversified operations have also developed accordingly. At present, there are 29 industrial and sideline and service industries, with a total of 82 units, including wine making, oil pressing, sugar making, soy sauce making, waste recycling, sewing, shoe making, soap making, rice and flour processing, fishing, and collecting mountain products. In terms of culture, education, and health, there is one Party school, one secondary vocational and technical school, one middle school, and twelve primary schools. Nurseries have been established in every team, and there is one hospital, ten clinics, and six film projection teams.
	Under the brilliant illumination of the general line and under the correct leadership of the Party, the farm has initially taken shape after three years of hard work by all employees and has initially possessed the conditions required for regular production. In the three years from establishing a point in a wasteland to the present, the state has invested a total of 15.06 million yuan, and the total output value in the three years is 19.6 million yuan.
	In this way, this large wasteland in northern China has initially changed its face.
	When the Party and the state decided to open up the Great Northern Wilderness and build the border area of the motherland into a socialist paradise of happiness, the right-wingers resolutely opposed it. They shouted such things as "The Great Northern Wilderness is barren land and it is impossible to grow good crops," and "It is impossible to gain a foothold in the Great Northern Wilderness." However, under the correct leadership of the Party at higher levels, all employees of the farm unswervingly implemented the Party's general line, strengthened the Party's leadership, and the employees, with soaring enthusiasm, strove to go upstream, and used facts to shatter the lies of the right-wingers. Facts have proved that not only can one gain a foothold in the Great Northern Wilderness, but as long as one resolutely implements the Party's general line, one can completely obtain large-area, high-yield, and bumper harvests.
	In order to build the Great Northern Wilderness into a socialist paradise of happiness, all employees of the farm have brought into play their soaring energy and the spirit of the People's Liberation Army to fight fiercely and rush forward. During sowing in 1958, the Fifth Branch Farm encountered the rainy season, and transportation was cut off, so seeds and food could not be transported in. In order to sow in time and not miss the farming season, the vast number of employees rushed to carry seeds day and night through more than ten miles of meadows with water up to their waists. Many comrades' shoes were broken, so they used tree bark as shoes; many comrades' legs and feet were red and swollen, but they still persisted in their work. Last winter and this spring, the employees braved the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius to carry out the struggle to vigorously develop water conservancy, accumulate fertilizer, and carry out crash logging. The comrades on the reservoir construction site put forward the slogan of blocking the peach blossom flood and getting through the farming and animal husbandry season well. In the frozen world, the work rate averaged about two cubic meters per person per day. Logging increased from an average of two cubic meters to six cubic meters per person per day (six processes), with a maximum of 40 cubic meters. This summer, there was a lot of rain, and some land was flooded. The employees braved the torrential rain to rush to drain water at night, and finally overcame the rain and ensured a good harvest.
	The achievements in agricultural production over the past three years are also inseparable from resolutely implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Under the correct leadership of the Party at higher levels, the 853 Farm implemented the agricultural Eight-Character Charter, centered on soil, fertilizer, and close planting, in accordance with local conditions. In the autumn, the land that accounted for one-third of the total sown area was deeply ploughed, and the entire sown area strictly implemented standard operations to ensure that the land was flat, fine, and broken. Last autumn and this spring, under the slogan of "work hard in winter and do a great job in spring," all employees of the farm accumulated more than one million tons of fertilizer and established some chemical fertilizer and bacterial fertilizer plants; completed more than 280,000 cubic meters of earth and stone water conservancy projects; at the same time, they strengthened land preparation, deep loosening, and autumn ploughing, conducted a 100% soil survey, designed land numbers, selected and treated seeds carefully, and implemented rational close planting. Therefore, the more than 350,000 mu of crops sown this year have achieved good harvests.
	For the past three years, the 853 Farm has been in a state of labor shortage and lack of machinery. This year, it is even more prominent. In order to resolutely complete the production and construction tasks assigned by the state, the farm Party committee, through vigorous mass movements, combined with socialist and communist education, repeatedly explained the political and economic significance of completing this year's production tasks, boosted the enthusiasm of the masses, and set off mass upsurges in the preparatory plowing, fertilizer accumulation, spring sowing, mid-cultivation weeding, wheat harvest, and autumn harvest stages. Seven thousand people were mobilized for mid-cultivation weeding, 7,500 people were mobilized for wheat harvest, and 8,000 people were mobilized for bean harvest. Because the masses were mobilized and competitions were launched, the completion of the operation plan was guaranteed.
	In order to give full play to the main force role of machinery, the farm Party committee strengthened political and ideological education among the machinery personnel, and the machinery personnel were full of soaring enthusiasm. This year's achievements were even more remarkable. In the spring sowing stage alone, each standard unit completed 3,335 standard mu, completing 194.8% of the stage target. The operation rate of the tractors was 78.8%, an increase of 15.8% compared with 1958; the time utilization rate was 85.1%; and the failures caused by poor maintenance were reduced by 70% compared with last year. Wheat sowing took only ten days, 40 days earlier than in 1958, and the quality was guaranteed.
	In the case of insufficient machinery, and lack of parts and repair tools, all employees of the farm launched a technical innovation movement. The farm has made a total of 30 technical innovations and 1,448 pieces, and 12 types of manual tool reforms and more than 900 pieces. These innovations have greatly saved labor and increased labor productivity.
	In terms of agricultural technology, winter sowing of spring wheat was successfully tested and promoted throughout the farm, which played a significant role in increasing yield, reducing the amount of work during spring sowing, and alleviating the tension of machinery.
	After the resolutions and communiqués of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were published, they greatly encouraged all employees of the 853 Farm. Now, a high tide of opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting enthusiasm, and vigorously increasing production and practicing economy has been set off throughout the farm. All employees are determined to work with greater enthusiasm and higher labor enthusiasm to strive for the comprehensive realization of the annual leap forward plan, and on this basis, are actively preparing for striving for a continued leap forward next year.

    建场三年　荒原变乐园
    介绍国营八五三农场事迹
    八五三农场在黑龙江省完达山北面，是密山垦区的一个边缘场。总土地面积四百六十五万亩，可耕地面积约占三分之一。水系以挠刀河为主，由哈玛通河、七里杏河、小清河等河组成。
    经过水利工程建设，水浇地面积可达七十五万亩，并且可以发电、通航。这里土壤肥沃，地
  势比较平坦，适于种植小麦、大豆、苞米等作物。地理状况，为在这里建成现代化的国营农场提供了充分的自然条件。
    八五三农场是1956年11月初建立的。主要成员是由铁道兵转业官兵组成，职工人数为二
  千一百名。当时，房无一间，地无一垅，一片荒原。在党的领导和全国的大力支援下，从建立开荒点到现在仅仅三年的时间，已经建立了七个农业分场（包括一个试验分场），一个中型畜牧场，一个林业分场和一个基建大队。全场共有三十七个农业生产队，七个畜牧生产队，五个副业队，四个林业队，十三个基建队。职工总人数已经增加到一万四千五百三十四人。现有机车八十八台（折合标准台为二百二十八台）、康拜因二十九台，各种农具六百四十台，汽车五十三辆，发电设备二百五十瓩，耕地面积已达到四十五万亩。今年播种的三十五万八千多亩作物，获得了较好的收成。根据实测，今年粮食作物总产量为八千余吨，比1958年增长230.1％。
    进行大规模的畜牧生产，是在1958年。1957年食用畜禽只有猪一百三十二头。1958年年终，猪达到二千七百八十一头，鸡三千六百四十八只，鸭九百一十二只。在这个基础上，为了实现畜牧更大跃进，畜牧人员进行了思想和组织上的整顿，培训了二百六十七名技术人员，实行了畜牧人员的专职负责制，推广了鸡鸭的产蛋、孵化、育雏，猪的产仔、成活，马的配种受胎、成活等先进经验，使畜牧生产获得了较迅速的发展。以今年1至8月份与1958年全年比较：猪增长了一倍半，鸡增长了五倍，鸭增长二点二倍，猪的成活率达85％，平均每窝成活八点五头。畜牧经营的种类，也由1957年的四种增加为十种。
    基本建设方面，坚决执行了基建为生产服务以及就地取材、因地制宜、因陋就简的原则。从建场到今年年底，全场已经完成和即将完成的基本建设总面积，将近二十万平方米。在农牧发展的同时，工副业多种经营也有了适应的发展。目前，工副业、服务性行业已有二十九项共八十二个单位，包括造酒、榨油、造糖、制酱油、废物更生、缝纫、制鞋、制肥皂、米面加工、捕鱼、采集山货等。文教卫生方面，有党校一所，中等专业技术学校一所，中学一所，小学十二所，队队都建立了托儿所，医院一个，门诊所十个，电影放映组六个。
    在总路线的光辉照耀下，在党的正确领导下，经过全体职工三年苦战，农场已经初具规模，并初步具备了正规生产所需要的条件。从一片荒地建点到现在的三年时间内，国家共投资一千五百零六万元，三年总产值共一千九百六十万元。
    这样，祖国北部的这块大荒原，已经初步地改变了它的面貌。
    当党和国家决定开垦北大荒，把祖国边疆建成为社会主义的幸福乐园的时候，右派分子是坚决反对的，他们叫喊什么“北大荒是不毛之地，不可能长好庄稼”，“在北大荒根本站不住脚”。但是在上级党的正确领导下，全场职工坚定不移地执行了党的总路线，加强了党的领导，职工群众鼓足干劲，力争上游，用事实粉碎了右派分子的谎言。事实证明，在北大荒不但可以站得住脚，而且只要是坚决执行党的总路线，完全可以获得大面积高额丰产。
    为了把北大荒建设成为社会主义的幸福乐园，全场职工发挥了冲天的干劲和解放军猛打猛冲的精神。在1958年播种的时候，五分场正逢雨季，交通断绝，种籽、粮食运不进去。广大职工为了及时播种，不错过农时，他们通过十几里水齐腰深的草甸子，日夜突击背种籽。很多同志的鞋子坏了，就用树皮当鞋子；很多同志的腿脚红肿了，仍然坚持工作。去冬今春，职工们冒着零下三十多度的严寒，开展了大搞水利、积肥和突击伐木的斗争。水库工地上的同志们提出了拦住桃花水过好农牧关的口号，在冰天冻地中，工率每人每天平均二立方左右。伐木每人每天由平均二立方提高到六立方（六道工序），最高达四十立方。今年夏季多雨，部分土地被淹，职工们冒着倾盆大雨夜间突击排水，终于战胜了雨水，保证了丰收。
    三年来农业生产获得的成绩，也是和坚决贯彻农业“八字宪法”分不开的。八五三农场在上级党的正确领导下，因地制宜地贯彻了以土、肥、密为中心的农业八字宪法。秋季深翻了占总播种面积三分之一的土地，全部播种面积严格实行了标准作业，保证了土地平整细碎。在去年秋冬及今年春季，在“苦干一冬，大干一春”的口号下，全场职工共积肥一百多万吨，并建立了一些化肥及菌肥厂；完成了水利工程二十八万多土石方；同时加强了整地、深松、秋耕，百分之百地进行了土壤普查、地号设计，种籽都经过了精选和处理，实行了合理密植。因此，今年播的三十五万多亩作物，获得了较好的收成。
    三年来，八五三农场一直处于劳动力缺、机具少的情况下，今年更为突出，为了坚决完成国家交给的生产建设任务，场党委通过大搞群众运动的方法，结合社会主义和共产主义教育，反复说明了完成今年生产任务的政治经济意义，鼓起了群众的干劲，在备耕、积肥、春播、中耕除草、麦收、秋收等作业阶段，掀起了群众性的突击高潮：中耕除草出动了七千人，麦收出动了七千五百人，豆收出动了八千人。由于发动了群众，开展了竞赛，保证了作业计划的完成。
    为了充分发挥机械的主力军作用，场党委在机务人员中加强了政治思想教育，机务人员干劲冲天，今年成绩更为显著。仅在春播阶段，每标准台就完成了三千三百三十五标准亩，完成了阶段指标的194.8％，机车的出车率为78.8％，比1958年提高了15.8％；时间利用率为85.1％；因保养不周所发生的故障，比去年减少了70％。小麦播种只用十天，比1958年提前四十天，而且保证了质量。
    在机具不足、零件及修理工具缺少的情况下，全场职工掀起了技术革新运动。全场技术革新共三十项、一千四百四十八件，手工工具改革十二种、九百多件，这些革新大大节约了劳动力，提高了劳动生产率。
    在农业技术方面，试验成功了春麦冬播，并在全场范围内推广，这对提高产量和减少春播时的作业量、缓和机具紧张状态，起了不少作用。
    党的八届八中全会决议和公报发表以后，大大地鼓舞了八五三农场的全体职工，现在，全场已经掀起了一个反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的高潮。全体职工决心以更大的干劲，更高的劳动热情，力争全年跃进计划的全面实现，并在这个基础上，为争取明年继续跃进而积极进行着准备。
