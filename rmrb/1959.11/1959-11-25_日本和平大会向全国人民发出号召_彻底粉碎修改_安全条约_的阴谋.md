Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd dispatch from Tokyo: The Japan Peace Congress closed today. The goal of the congress was to promote the end of the Cold War, smash the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," strive for complete disarmament, and improve living standards.

The congress unanimously adopted nine resolutions, a program of action, and a congress declaration.

The resolution on opposing the revision of the "Security Treaty" stated that in order to smash the conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the participants will launch a struggle with victorious confidence and resolute action. The resolution stated that all peace forces will be concentrated to hold the eighth and ninth national unified actions to stop the revision of the "Security Treaty," and a nationwide signature campaign for complete disarmament and against the revision of the "Security Treaty" will be launched to prevent Nobusuke Kishi and Fujiyama from going to the United States to sign a new treaty.

The resolution on opposing Japan's nuclear armament pointed out that the shipment of "Sidewinder" missiles to Japan, the establishment of missile launch sites on Niijima Island, and the testing of "Nike" missiles on Okinawa Island all show what the specific purpose of revising the "Security Treaty" is. The resolution pointed out that this is the first step towards Japan's nuclear armament.

The resolution pointed out that today, there is no basis whatsoever for expanding armaments and implementing nuclear armament. Moreover, this violates the United Nations resolution on complete disarmament and the Japanese Constitution. The resolution demanded that the United States and Japanese authorities cease all attempts to arm Japan with nuclear weapons, withdraw U.S. troops from Japan, and return Okinawa Island to Japan.

The resolution on restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China pointed out that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the Japan-Chiang treaty are obstacles to establishing friendly relations between Japan and China. The resolution emphasized further developing the national movement to strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

The other six resolutions adopted by the congress were: the resolution on demanding that the Japanese government immediately conclude a Japan-Soviet peace treaty; urging all prefectural, county, and city assemblies to pass resolutions on restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China and concluding a Japan-Soviet peace treaty; the resolution on struggling to prevent the Diet from approving the agreement to pay reparations to South Vietnam; the resolution supporting the proposal of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the peaceful reunification of Korea; the resolution on assisting the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan; and the resolution on demanding that the Japanese government stop expanding its military and provide relief to victims of wind and water disasters.

The program of action adopted by the congress stipulated that at a time when the international situation is changing, the internal contradictions of the Japanese reactionary forces are deepening, and the consciousness of the masses is further raised, we will still firmly maintain our victorious confidence, unite all peace lovers, and do everything in our power to launch actions to strive for the victory of the struggle.

The congress declaration said that the people of all countries in the world are watching the Japanese people's struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty." We will organize our ranks and fight to thoroughly smash the conspiracy to revise the "Security Treaty" and further strive for the withdrawal of U.S. troops and the removal of U.S. military bases.

The declaration stated that we will unite the forces of people with different thoughts and beliefs, with workers' strikes as the center, to urge the Japanese government to change its policies and strive for Japan to move towards the only bright future—neutrality and peaceful coexistence—to the end.

The congress then held a ceremony commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Japanese peace movement.

At the meeting, Ahmad El-Herm, a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, awarded the Gold Medal of Peace to the Japan Peace Committee on behalf of the World Peace Council, and awarded the Silver Medal of Peace to twenty-eight deceased individuals who contributed to the peace movement, including Ikio Oyama and Kanzo Uchiyama, and to forty organizations and individuals who are currently actively engaged in the peace movement. The representatives from various regions who participated in the congress will submit the relevant resolutions adopted by the congress to the government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party tomorrow.

    日本和平大会向全国人民发出号召
    彻底粉碎修改“安全条约”的阴谋
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本和平大会今天闭幕。大会的目标是促进结束冷战、粉碎修改日美“安全条约”、争取彻底裁军和提高生活。
    大会一致通过了九项决议、运动方针以及大会宣言。
    关于反对修改“安全条约”的决议表示，为了粉碎修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋，与会者将以胜利的信心和坚决的行动展开斗争。决议表示，将集中一切和平力量举行第八次和第九次阻止修改“安全条约”全国统一行动，并且要展开征集全面裁军和反对修改“安全条约”的全国性签名运动，阻止岸信介和藤山到美国签订新条约。
    关于反对日本核武装的决议指出，向日本运进“响尾蛇式”导弹、在新岛设置导弹发射场、在冲绳岛试验“奈克式”导弹等一切表明，修改“安全条约”的具体目的究竟是什么。决议指出，这意味着日本进行核武装的第一步。
    决议指出，在今天，没有任何根据要扩充军备和实行核武装。不仅如此，这是违背联合国关于全面裁军的决议和日本宪法的。决议要求美国和日本当局停止一切核武装日本的企图，从日本撤出美军，并且把冲绳岛还给日本。
    关于恢复日中邦交的决议指出，日美“安全条约”和日蒋条约是日中两国间建立友好关系的障碍。决议强调进一步发展国民运动，争取恢复日中邦交。
    大会通过的另外六项决议是：关于要求日本政府立即缔结日苏和约的决议；促使所有府、县、市议会通过关于恢复日中邦交和缔结日苏和约的决议；关于为阻止国会批准对南越支付赔偿的协定而奋斗的决议；支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议关于和平统一朝鲜的建议的决议；关于协助遣送旅日朝侨回国的决议；关于要求日本政府停止扩军、救济风灾、水灾受害者的决议。
    大会通过的运动方针规定，在国际形势发生变化、日本反动势力内部矛盾加深、人民群众的觉悟进一步提高的现在，仍坚定胜利信心，团结一切和平爱好者，尽所有力量展开行动，争取斗争的胜利。
    大会宣言说，世界各国人民注视着日本人民为阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争，我们将整齐队伍，为彻底粉碎修改“安全条约”的阴谋并进一步争取撤出美军和撤销美军基地而奋斗。
    宣言表示，将团结不同思想和信仰的人民的力量，以工人阶级的罢工为中心，为促使日本政府改变政策，争取日本走向唯一的光明前途——中立、和平共处而斗争到底。
    大会接着举行了日本和平运动十周年纪念典礼。
    会上，世界和平理事会常务委员会委员艾哈迈德·赫尔代表世界和平理事会向日本和平委员会授予和平金奖，向已逝世的对和平运动有贡献的大山郁夫、内山完造等二十八人以及目前积极展开和平运动的四十个组织和个人授予和平银奖。参加大会的各地代表明天将把大会通过的有关决议递交政府和执政的自由民主党。
