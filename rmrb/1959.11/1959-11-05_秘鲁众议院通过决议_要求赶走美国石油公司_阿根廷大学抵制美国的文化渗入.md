Latin American Anti-American Struggle is Developing

    According to information from Cuba, Peru, Panama, and Brazil, the broad masses of people in these countries continue to wage struggles against American interference, aggression, and plunder. Panama has seen anti-American demonstrations to reclaim the Canal Zone, the Peruvian House of Representatives has demanded the expulsion of the US Texaco company, the Brazilian government has taken over an American meat refrigeration company, and the Cuban government continues to take over land owned by American companies. This all illustrates that the movement of Latin American countries to break free from US imperialist control and achieve complete independence is developing.

    Peruvian House of Representatives Passes Resolution
    Demanding the Expulsion of US Oil Company
    Argentine University Resists US Cultural Infiltration

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Peruvian House of Representatives passed a resolution on the evening of the 2nd, demanding that the government drive the American Texaco oil company out of Peru because this company was collecting military photos and conducting espionage activities in Peru. The resolution also demanded that the US government be strongly protested for violating the 1948 agreement signed with Peru regarding aerial photography.

    On the same day that the Peruvian House of Representatives passed the above resolution, the Peruvian Air Force Ministry also issued a public statement expressing dissatisfaction with the US government's sale of photos related to Peruvian national defense to the Texaco oil company. The public statement pointed out that Texaco oil company did not obtain permission from the Peruvian government for the above photos, but only went through procedures with the US State Department. Although the US State Department stated that official Peruvian permission must be obtained, it still sold this set of military area photos for $3,445.

    According to reports, this set of photos totaled 2,871, including the geographical conditions of an area along the Marañón River. This area, starting near Utku Bamba and extending to the mouth of the Ucayali River, is a national defense strategic area. This transaction between the US State Department and Texaco was completed in 1953, but was not exposed until May 7th of this year. On that day, when an employee of Texaco was handing over approximately 200 photos to the Lenci Schettu Chart Company, personnel from the Peruvian National Air Survey suddenly apprehended him. They also discovered codes beneath these negatives. In October of this year, the Peruvian National Air Survey decided to fine Texaco 150,000 soles and ordered the company to hand over the negatives of these photos within 48 hours. However, this order was not taken seriously by this American company. On the contrary, its legal representative, Echecopar Garcia, in a letter to the director of the Air Survey, even denied possessing strategic photos.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Supreme Council of the University of Buenos Aires recently decided to temporarily suspend negotiations between the various departments and the "Argentine Committee of the Economic Promotion Fund Administration" regarding teachers and students going to the United States to study. The Supreme Council also decided to re-examine the regulations for providing financial "aid" to the university by the aforementioned Argentine Committee of the Fund Administration and the US International Cooperation Administration.

    The Argentine Committee of the Economic Promotion Fund Administration was established to implement Truman's Point Four Program. Emilio de Ípola, chairman of the University Federation of Buenos Aires, accused this committee of being "actually a foreign institution colluding with the US activities mission," and that participating in this institution would "violate the autonomy of the university and national sovereignty."

    拉丁美洲反美斗争在发展中
    据来自古巴、秘鲁、巴拿马和巴西的讯息，这些国家的广大人民对美国的干涉、侵略和掠夺活动继续展开斗争。巴拿马爆发争取收回运河区的反美示威，秘鲁众议院要求赶走美国德士古公司，巴西政府接管美国的肉类冷藏公司，古巴政府继续接管美国公司的土地。这都说明了拉丁美洲各国人民摆脱美帝国主义控制和取得完全独立的运动在发展中。
    秘鲁众议院通过决议
    要求赶走美国石油公司
    阿根廷大学抵制美国的文化渗入
    据新华社讯　秘鲁众议院2日晚通过决议案，要求政府把美国德士古石油公司赶出秘鲁，因为这家公司在秘鲁收集军事照片、进行间谍活动。决议案还要求就美国违反1948年同秘鲁签订的关于空中摄影的协定向美国政府提出强烈抗议。
    在秘鲁众议院通过上述决议的同一天，秘鲁空军部也发表公报，对美国政府把有关秘鲁国防的照片卖给德士古石油公司表示不满。公报指出，德士古石油公司没有向秘鲁政府取得上述照片的许可，而只是在美国国务院办了一个手续。美国国务院虽然声明必须取得秘鲁官方的许可，但还是以三千四百四十五美元出卖了这套军事地区的照片。
    据报道，这套照片共计二千八百七十一张，包括马拉农河沿岸一带领土的地理情况。从乌特库瓦姆巴附近开始到乌开雅利河的出海口的这一地带是国防战略地区。美国国务院同德士古公司的这一宗买卖是1953年成交的，但直到今年5月7日才被揭穿。这一天当德士古石油公司的一名职员正把约二百张照片交给伦西埃图表公司时，秘鲁全国航空测绘总署的人员突然抓住了他。他们还发现这些底片下面有密码。到今年10月，秘鲁全国航空测绘总署决定判处德士古公司十五万索尔的罚款，并勒令这家公司在四十八小时内交出这些照片的底片。但这一命令并没有受到这家美国公司的重视，相反，它的法律代理人埃切科帕·加西亚在给航空测绘总署署长的信件中还否认保存了战略照片。
    据新华社讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯大学最高委员会最近决定暂时停止各院同“经济促进基金管理局阿根廷委员会”关于教师和学生赴美留学问题的商谈。最高委员会还决定重新研究对上述基金管理局阿根廷委员会及美国国际合作署给予大学财政“援助”的条例。
    经济促进基金管理局阿根廷委员会是为了执行杜鲁门的第四点计划而建立的。布宜诺斯艾利斯大学联合会主席埃米略·德伊波拉指责这个委员会“实际上是一个和美国活动使团勾结的外国机构”，参加这个机构将“侵犯大学的自治和国家主权”。
