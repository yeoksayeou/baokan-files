Forge Ahead, Leap Forward Again and Again
    A Record of the Ongoing Efforts of Yingkou Paper Mill Workers to Increase Production
    The Yingkou Paper Mill in Liaoning Province is an integrated pulp and paper manufacturing facility. In addition to producing some paper, the factory primarily produces commercial pulp. The annual output is 120,000 tons of pulp, 15,000 tons of paper, and 10,000 tons of adhesives. These products are supplied to people and factories throughout the country.
    The Yingkou Paper Mill was taken over from Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, the restoration of production was rapidly completed, and the First Five-Year Plan was successfully completed one year and ten months ahead of schedule. The factory fully mobilized the masses, continuously overcame difficulties, and created advanced production methods such as "boiling pulp with white water," "rapid cooking method," "sectional ventilation, two-stage recovery cooking method," and "increased mechanical furnace combustion intensity," which greatly shortened the cooking time and increased production. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the cooking time set seven national records, with the shortest time reduced to one hour and fourteen minutes, completing the leap forward plan ahead of schedule. The total output value of the factory increased by 53% compared to 1957. Entering 1959, the factory continued to leap forward at an even greater pace. From January to September this year, the total industrial output value increased by 471% compared to the same period last year, pulp production increased by 137% compared to the same period last year, and the annual production plan of 72,000 tons of commercial pulp was completed 102 days ahead of schedule. Now, inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all factory workers are working harder and striving to complete the pulp and paper targets set in the Second Five-Year Plan this year.
    Self-Reliance to Break Through the Electricity Barrier
    Due to the great leap forward in production in all walks of life, at the beginning of this year, the Yingkou Paper Mill encountered difficulties due to insufficient electricity, and production once declined, seriously affecting the need for pulp from twenty-six fraternal paper mills across the country.
    Under this situation, the Yingkou Paper Mill had three paths to take. One was to ask the state for electricity; but this path could not be taken, because if the electricity were taken, it would affect the production of heavy industrial departments. Another way was to produce as much pulp as electricity was provided, which was obviously not in line with the spirit of continued leap forward and the Party's general line. So what to do? There was only one feasible way, which was to work hard and overcome difficulties through self-reliance. Therefore, starting in mid-March, a comprehensive electricity saving campaign was launched throughout the factory. At that time, the Party committee proposed to all factory workers the direction of: saving electricity from improving the process, improving operations, and improving equipment. Because all factory workers conscientiously implemented the Party committee's requirements, more than 700 suggestions were put forward in a few days, which can be summarized into 48 feasible measures. Subsequently, all factory workers launched a major competition to implement the measures. In just over ten days, all 48 measures were implemented. After the implementation of these measures, more than 40,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity were saved every day. In this way, under the condition that the power supply increased to 80,000 kilowatt-hours, the pulp production increased sharply from more than 100 tons per day to more than 400 tons, and the battle for pulp was won in the first battle.
    Fighting Inferior Coal
    After breaking through the electricity barrier, the entire production situation changed. However, at this time, a new key problem was faced, which was the difficulty of burning inferior coal. Due to the poor quality of the coal and low calorific value, it had a great impact on the steam supply for production. At that time, there were also two paths to take: one was to lower the production level according to the heating conditions of inferior coal, but this path was a retreat that all employees could not take; the other was to use low-quality coal to generate high energy. After analyzing the conditions at that time, the factory Party committee proposed to all factory workers the call to make inferior coal generate high energy and reduce coal consumption, and immediately formed a technical innovation movement to break through the inferior coal barrier throughout the factory. Through this movement, six advanced experiences such as "thick coal slow burning" and "less air supply and frequent fire dialing" were created, so that under the condition of using 50% inferior coal, the need for steam consumption in production was guaranteed. On this basis, measures such as improving boiler efficiency, reducing combustible matter in coal slag, increasing carbon dioxide content in flue gas, pipeline insulation, and saving steam consumption in production were taken to reduce coal consumption per ton of pulp from 884 kilograms in the first quarter to 536 kilograms in September.
    Organize a New Production Balance
    When the electricity and coal barriers were broken through, what followed was the imbalance in equipment capacity: the three main equipments—cooking pots—already had the capacity to produce 28 to 30 pots per day, but at that time, the drug-making capacity of the first half could only supply the amount of drug liquid for 20 pots, and the maximum capacity of the paper-making machine in the second half was only about 200 tons. Therefore, in order to stabilize the high yield, it was necessary to organize a new balance between the front and rear equipment and the upper and lower processes. However, at that time, organizing a new balance could not solve this problem by adding equipment or building new projects, which was not only costly, but also time-consuming. What to do? Only by relying closely on the masses, vigorously carrying out technical innovation, and tapping the potential of equipment. Therefore, the Party committee proposed to all factory workers: to take the development of the capacity of the main equipment as the center, vigorously carry out technical innovation, and use methods such as improving operation, improving technology, and improving process conditions to vigorously tap the potential of existing equipment. According to the requirements put forward by the Party committee, all factory workers immediately launched a technical innovation movement focusing on improving operation and improving process technology. After this movement was launched, in less than a few days, all factory workers put forward thousands of innovation suggestions. In terms of drug-making, workers adopted advanced operation methods of improving water addition in the furnace and controlling the furnace temperature, so that the amount of ore added per hour in the fluidized bed furnace was increased from the original 2,700 kilograms to 4,000 kilograms, so that the drug-making capacity was increased by more than 30%. In terms of paper-making, due to the improvement of the wire cage and the squeeze roller, the daily output increased from 200 tons to more than 250 tons, and reached a maximum of 300 tons. In addition, in order to balance the paper-making capacity, four wet paper-making machines were made from waste and old materials to supplement the insufficient capacity of the paper-making machine, so that the entire paper-making capacity was further improved, and the daily output reached a level of 400 to 500 tons. With the improvement of paper-making and drug-making equipment, corresponding measures were also taken in departments such as cutting and refining, so that all equipment reached a new balance. In this way, the high yield level of 28 pots per day was stabilized on the basis of the new balance. Therefore, since April, the plan of producing 10,000 tons of pulp per month has been realized every month.
    Comprehensive Reduction of Consumption
    After the formation of the high yield situation, the problem facing was how to consolidate the high yield and continue to improve it. Therefore, it is necessary to organize a comprehensive leap forward of high yield, high quality, low consumption, and safety in the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical. In order to achieve this, the Party committee proposed to all factory workers in May that to consolidate high yield, improve quality, reduce costs, and improve labor productivity, it is necessary to strengthen scientific management and ensure safety as the center. In order to implement this requirement, all factory workers launched a movement throughout the factory to check management, check quotas, reduce various consumptions, and review rules and regulations. Through the exposure of the masses, hundreds of loopholes, large and small, were found in management and quotas. In order to plug these loopholes, all factory workers were organized to use methods such as mass airing, mass blooming, and mass debate to review and revise rules and regulations. After the mass review and revision, the factory established 14 kinds of production management systems and 10 kinds of business management systems. At the same time, based on the principle of combining leadership and the masses, a two-level decentralized management method was established; at the same time, 40 quotas were determined throughout the factory, and then a factory-wide competition to break through quotas was launched. Due to the strengthening of management and the development of the competition to break through quotas, from May to the end of September, 34 comparable items out of the 40 quotas of the factory decreased compared with the first quarter. For example, the unit pulp consumption of paper was 895 kilograms in the first quarter, and decreased to 855 kilograms from May to September, and coal consumption was 884 kilograms in the first quarter, and decreased to an average of 576 kilograms from May to September.
    In addition to the general reduction of various consumption quotas compared with the first quarter, under the condition of using 30% of substitute materials, 21 quotas have exceeded the historical level, and 9 items have reached the national advanced level.

    勇往直前跃进再跃进
    记营口造纸厂职工不断提高生产的事迹
    辽宁省营口造纸厂是一个制浆造纸综合性的工厂。这个工厂除了生产一部分纸张以外，主要是生产商品纸浆。年产量纸浆为十二万吨，纸一万五千吨，粘合剂一万吨；这些产品都是用来供应全国人民和各地工厂的需要的。
    营口造纸厂是从日本帝国主义和国民党手中接收过来的。解放以后，在党的正确领导下，迅速地完成了生产恢复工作，胜利地提前一年零十个月完成了第一个五年计划。这个厂充分地发动了群众，不断克服困难，创造出“白水煮浆”、“快速蒸煮法”、“分段通气，两段回收蒸煮法”、“提高机械炉燃烧强度”等先进生产方法，大大缩短了煮浆时间，提高了产量。在大跃进的1958年，蒸煮时间又连创七次全国最高纪录，最短时间缩短到一小时零十四分钟，提前完成跃进计划，全厂总产值比1957年增长53％。进入1959年，这个厂以更大的步伐继续跃进。今年1至9月份工业总产值比去年同期提高471％，纸浆生产量比去年同期增长137％，并且提前一百零二天完成了全年七万二千吨商品浆的生产计划。现在，全厂职工在党的八届八中全会精神的鼓舞下，鼓起更大干劲，为在今年完成第二个五年计划规定的纸浆和纸的指标而斗争。
    自力更生破电关
    由于各行各业生产大跃进，今年年初，营口造纸厂遇到了电力不足的困难，生产一度下降，严重地影响着全国大小二十六个兄弟造纸厂对纸浆的需要。
    在这种形势下，营口造纸厂有三条路可走。一条是向国家要电；可是这条路不能走，因为如果把电要来，就会影响重工业部门的生产。另一条路就是给多少电，生产多少纸浆，显然这不符合继续跃进和党的总路线的精神。那么怎办呢？只有一条可行之路，就是鼓足干劲，自力更生克服困难。因此，从3月中旬开始，在全厂掀起了一个全面性的节电运动。当时党委向全厂职工提出的方向是：要从改进流程上、改进操作上、改进设备上来节省电量。由于全厂职工认真贯彻了党委这一要求，在几天内共提出七百多条建议，归纳起来就有四十八项可行的措施。接着，全厂职工就开展了实现措施的大竞赛，仅在十几天内，四十八项措施就全部实现了。实现这些措施以后，每天节省电量四万多度。这样就在供电量增到八万度的条件下，纸浆产量由每日一百多吨，猛增到四百多吨，夺浆大战，初战告捷。
    同劣煤决斗
    缺电关突破以后，整个生产局势转变了过来。可是，这时又面临着一个新的关键，就是烧劣煤的困难。由于煤质不好，发热量低，对生产供汽有很大影响。当时也是有两条道路可走：一条是按劣煤发热条件把生产水平压低，可是这条道路是全体职工不能走的回头路；另一条就是要用低劣煤发高能。厂党委分析了当时的条件之后，便向全厂职工提出让劣煤发高能和降低煤耗的号召，立即在全厂形成一个突破劣煤关的技术革新运动。通过这一运动，先后创造出“厚煤慢烧”、“少给风勤拨火”等六项先进经验，这样就在使用50％的劣煤的条件下，保证了生产上用汽量的需要。在这个基础上，又采取提高锅炉效率、减少煤渣可燃物、提高烟道三氧化碳含量、管道保温、生产节省用汽等等措施，使生产每吨浆耗煤量由第一季度的八百八十四公斤，下降到9月份的五百三十六公斤。
    组织新的生产平衡
    当电、煤关突破以后，跟踪而来的是设备能力不平衡：三台主体设备——蒸煮罐已有日产二十八罐到三十罐的能力，可是当时前半部制药能力只能供给二十罐的药液量，后半部抄浆机能力最大量也不过在二百吨左右。因此，要想把高产稳定下来，必须组织前后设备、上下工序之间的新平衡。但是，当时组织新平衡，又不能以增添设备或新建工程来解决这个问题，这不仅费钱，而且时间也来不及。怎么办呢？只有紧紧依靠群众，大搞技术革新，挖掘设备潜力。因此，党委便向全厂职工提出：要以发挥主体设备能力为中心，大搞技术革新，用改进操作，改进技术，改进工艺条件等方法，来大力挖掘现有设备潜力。全厂职工按着党委提出的要求，立即掀起以改进操作、改进工艺技术为内容的技术革新运动。这个运动掀起以后，不到几天时间，全厂职工就提出了上千条革新建议。在制药方面，工人采取了改进炉中加水和控制炉温的先进操作方法，使沸腾炉每小时加矿量，由原来的二千七百公斤，一跃提高到四千公斤，使制药能力提高30％以上。在抄浆方面，由于改进了网箱和挤水辊，使日产量由二百吨提高到二百五十吨以上，最高达到三百吨。另外，为了平衡抄浆能力，又利用废料和旧料制成四台湿抄机，补充了抄浆机能力的不足，使整个抄浆能力又提高了一步，日产量达到四百到五百吨的水平。随着抄浆和制药设备的改进，在切料、精选等部门，也都相应地采取了措施，使全部设备都达到了新的平衡。这样就把日产二十八罐的高产水平在新的平衡基础上稳定下来。因此，从4月份起，每月都实现了月产万吨纸浆的计划。
    全面降低消耗
    高产形势形成以后，面对着的问题是如何巩固高产和继续再提高的问题。因此，这就要以多、快、好、省的精神，来组织高产、优质、低消耗、保安全的全面跃进。为了作到这一点，党委在5月份便向全厂职工提出，要以加强科学管理，保证安全为中心，来巩固高产，提高质量，降低成本，提高劳动生产率。全厂职工为了贯彻这一要求，在全厂掀起了一个查管理、查定额、降低各种消耗和审查规章制度的运动。通过群众的揭发，找出了在管理上和定额上大大小小上百的漏洞，为了堵塞这些漏洞，又组织全厂职工用大鸣大放大辩论等方法，来审修规章制度。经过群众审修后，全厂建立起来的生产管理制度有十四种，业务管理制度十种，同时又本着领导和群众相结合的原则，建立起两级分权管理办法；与此同时，又在全厂确定了四十项定额，接着开展了全厂性的突破定额竞赛。由于管理上的加强和突破定额竞赛运动的开展，从5月份开始到9月末，全厂四十项定额中可比的三十四项，比第一季度都下降了。如纸的单位耗浆量第一季度为八百九十五公斤，5至9月就下降到八百五十五公斤，煤耗第一季度为八百八十四公斤，5至9月平均下降到五百七十六公斤。
    除了各种消耗定额比第一季普遍降低以外，在使用代用料30％的条件下，已有二十一项定额超过历史水平，并有九项达到全国先进水平。
