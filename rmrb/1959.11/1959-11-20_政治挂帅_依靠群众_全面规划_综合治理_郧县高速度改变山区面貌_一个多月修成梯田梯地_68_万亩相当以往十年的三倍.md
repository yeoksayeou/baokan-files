Politics in Command, Relying on the Masses, Comprehensive Planning, Integrated Management
Yun County Changes the Mountainous Landscape at High Speed
680,000 Mu of Terraces and Sloping Fields Completed in Over a Month, Equivalent to Three Times the Previous Ten Years
    (Our Dispatch) Can the mountainous landscape be changed at high speed? The facts in Yun County, Hubei Province, demonstrate that as long as the Party's leadership is strengthened, the masses are relied upon, mass movements are vigorously launched, measures are adapted to local conditions, comprehensive planning is implemented, comprehensive management is carried out, and integrated development is pursued, it can be done. In just over a month, Yun County transformed over five thousand three hundred mountains and over nineteen thousand gullies into layers of terraces and sloping fields (a total of over 170,000 mu of terraces and over 510,000 mu of sloping fields), equivalent to three times the total area of terraces and sloping fields transformed since liberation; the county afforested over 170,000 mu of barren mountains, and built 69 new orchards (a total of over 7,000 mu); and built over 200 highways, roads, and major roads, totaling 2,000 li in length.
    Yun County has many mountains and much water, and has always been considered a "poor mountainous area with harsh waters." After liberation, although there have been great changes, the area's basic landscape has not been fundamentally altered because the focus was not on the key link of basic construction in mountainous areas and a lack of focus on fundamentals in terms of altering the local area. Last year, after the establishment of the People's Communes, the broad masses of people urgently demanded a rapid change in the mountainous landscape, but how could this be achieved? The Yun County Party Committee conscientiously summarized the experience of Gao Huatang in leading the masses in the Construction Management Area to rapidly change the face of the mountainous area, and called on the people of the county to learn from Gao Huatang and launch a movement to manage mountains, water, and soil.
    Managing mountains, water, and soil is a revolution against nature. Previously, there were two different views in Yun County: some people believed that the mountainous landscape could be changed at high speed; others advocated proceeding step by step and taking it slowly. In light of this situation, the Yun County Party Committee recently organized more than 190 reporting groups to vigorously conduct socialist and General Line education, organized more than 6,000 cadres from production teams and above to visit and study the Construction Management Area of the Dayan Commune, and launched a large-scale debate among the vast numbers of cadres and masses in the county on the topic of "Can the mountainous landscape be changed at high speed? Can water, mountain, and soil management be carried out comprehensively?" In the debate, the methods of calculating increased production and recounting the suffering of drought and flood disasters were fully used, so that people could recognize the benefits of comprehensive water, mountain, and soil management. During the discussion, the members of the Dayan Commune used the facts of their commune to illustrate that one mu of sloping land only produces a hundred catties of grain a year, while if it is converted into sloping fields it produces about 400 catties of grain a year, and if it is converted into terraces it produces 700-800 catties of grain a year, an increase of three to six times compared to sloping land; if dragon's beard grass (industrial raw material), tung oil, tea seeds, and fruit trees are planted on the ridges of terraces and sloping fields, the income will be dozens of times greater than that of sloping land. After such calculations, the masses said, "Carrying out these basic construction projects is a great blessing for future generations!" In this way, a mass movement centered on "three managements" to change the mountainous landscape was launched vigorously throughout the county.
    Relying on the masses, adapting to local conditions, comprehensive management, and integrated utilization are important experiences for Yun County in accelerating the construction of mountainous areas. Here, full use is made of the terrain features, with the commune as the unit, unified planning is carried out, and the management area is used as the unit for specific arrangements according to local conditions, implementing comprehensive management and integrated development. For example, in places with good water sources, small slopes, and labor-saving land reclamation, more land is converted into fields; in places with steep slopes and scarce water sources, more trees are planted and afforested; terraced fields are extensively built below mountain canals, and sloping fields are converted or trees are planted above the canals; sunny slopes are suitable for building economic forests, and shady slopes are suitable for planting timber forests.
    In terms of methods for changing the mountainous landscape, a combination of planning and action is adopted. First, rivers are planned one by one, and mountains are planned one by one; then, in the spirit of prioritizing what is easy before what is difficult, fertile mountains are transformed before barren mountains, and nearby low mountains are transformed before distant high mountains. To manage mountains, it is necessary to first manage water. According to the characteristics of high mountains and high water, Yun County's general practice is to find water sources at the highest points and start from the source; then, open canals around the mountains according to the mountain ranges, divert water to the top of the mountains, and then build dams section by section from the source of the ditches and rivers, and build ponds and reservoirs at every ditch, so that the mountains have canals at every level from top to bottom, and every ditch has ponds (reservoirs). High water irrigates the top of the mountains, low canals irrigate the middle of the mountains, and reservoirs and ponds irrigate the bottom of the mountains and ditches. At the same time, fields are built below the canals, land is transformed above the canals, forests are planted on the slopes, and grass is planted on the edges of the land. This not only makes the best use of water, makes the best use of mountains, and makes full use of every inch of land, but also uses less labor and makes changes quickly, greatly saving labor.
    In order to build a new mountainous area at high speed, Yun County has made full use of the advantages of the People's Commune in mobilizing and organizing labor, tools, etc., launching mass movements and organizing large-scale operations. Generally, the commune provides unified command, and the management area and production team cooperate as units.
    Since the launch of the "three managements" in this county, 150,000 laborers have been concentrated, 105 corps have been organized, more than 30,000 yokes of oxen, and more than 200,000 tools have been deployed to the mountains to set up camps, spread out on a thousand-mile front, successively besieged more than 5,300 mountain tops, attacking and defeating each mountain one by one, in full bloom. Because of the large number of people and the strong momentum, one mountain a day and one slope a day produced significant results and inspired people, so the masses became more and more enthusiastic.
    During this period, many communes also vigorously carried out tool reforms. According to incomplete statistics, the county has modified and added more than 60,000 double-bottom plows, soil sifters, holding boards, and other tools during the process of transforming terraced fields and sloping fields, which greatly improved work efficiency. At present, Yun County's mass movement of managing mountains, water, and soil is rising wave upon wave, changing day by day.

    政治挂帅　依靠群众　全面规划　综合治理
    郧县高速度改变山区面貌
    一个多月修成梯田梯地68万亩相当以往十年的三倍
    本报讯　能不能高速度地改变山区面貌？湖北省郧县的事实说明，只要加强党的领导，依靠群众，大搞群众运动，因地制宜，全面规划，全面治理，综合开发，就能够办得到。在一个多月时间里，郧县把五千三百多座山、一万九千多条沟，变成层层叠叠的梯田梯地
  （共计梯田十七万多亩，梯地五十一万多亩），相当于解放以来改的梯田梯地总面积的三倍；全县在荒山植树十七万多亩，新建花果山六十九座（共七千多亩）；修公路、马路、大路二百多条，长达二千华里。
    郧县境内山多水多，一向被人们认为“山穷水恶”的地方。解放后，虽有很大改变，但因为没有抓住山区基本建设这个中心环节，没有能从根本上改变这个地区的面貌。去年，人民公社建立后，广大群众迫切地要求迅速改变山区面貌，但怎样才能办得到呢？郧县县委认真地总结了高华堂领导建设管理区群众迅速改变山区这个地区的面貌的经验，号召全县人民学高华堂，开展治山、治水、治土运动。
    治山、治水、治土是向大自然的一场革命。以前，在郧县存在着两种不同的看法，有人认为能够高速度地改变山区面貌；有人则主张按部就班，慢慢来。根据这一情况，中共郧县县委不久前组织了一百九十多个报告团，大张旗鼓地进行了社会主义和总路线教育，组织生产队以上的干部共六千多人到大堰公社建设管理区参观、学习，以“能不能高速度地改变山区面貌、治水治山治土能不能全面进行？”为题发动全县广大干部和群众，大鸣大放大辩论。在辩论中，充分运用算增产账，诉旱、涝灾害苦等办法，从而使人们认识到全面治水、治山、治土的好处。大堰公社的社员在讨论中，用本社事实说明：一亩坡地一年产粮食只有百把斤，如改成梯地一年产粮食四百斤左右，改成梯田一年产粮食七、八百斤，比坡地增产三倍至六倍多；如在梯田梯地埂地边上种植龙须草（工业原料），油桐、茶子和果树等，比坡地的收入要大几十倍。这样一算，群众说：“搞这些基本建设，是子孙万代的大喜事哟！”就这样，在全县范围内一个以“三治”为中心的改变山区面貌的群众运动，风起云涌地开展起来了。
    依靠群众，因地制宜，全面治理，综合利用，是郧县加速山区建设的重要经验。在这里，充分利用地形特点，以公社为单位，统一规划，以管理区为单位因地制宜地具体安排，贯彻全面治理，综合开发。比如，在水源好、坡度小、改田省工的地方，就多改田；坡度大、水源缺的地方，就多植树造林；在盘山渠下大改梯田，渠上改梯地或植树造林；向阳坡宜造经济林，阴坡宜植用材林。
    在改变山区面貌的方法上，采取边规划、边行动。首先是一条河一条河的规划，一架山一架山的规划；然后，本着先易后难的精神，先改肥山、后改瘦山，先改近山低山、后改远山高山。治山必须先治水，根据山高水高的特点，郧县一般的作法是：在最高的地方，找出水源，从根治起；然后，按山脉盘山开渠，把水引向山顶，再从沟河的发源以下，节节扎坝，逢沟扎塘扎库，使山岭从上到下层层有渠，沟沟有塘（库），高水灌山顶，低渠灌山腰，库塘灌山脚沟底。同时，渠下改田，渠上改地，坡上造林，地边植草。这样既能做到水尽其力，山尽其用，寸土不闲，又用工少，改的快，大大节省劳动力。
    为了高速度地建设新山区，郧县充分运用人民公社在动员和组织劳动力、工具等方面的优越性，开展群众运动，组织大兵团作战。一般是由公社统一指挥，以管理区、生产队为单位协同作战。
    这个县开展“三治”以来，集中了十五万名劳动力，组织了一百零五个兵团，三万多犋耕牛，二十多万件工具，上山扎营，摆开了一千多里的战线，先后围攻了五千三百多个山头，一架山一架山地突击，各个击破，全面开花。由于人多势众，一天一架山，一天一面坡，成绩显著，鼓舞人心，因而群众越干劲越大。
    许多公社还在这个期间，大搞工具改革。据不完全统计，全县在改梯田梯地过程中，共改装添制双铧犁、土簸箕、抱板等六万多件，这就大大提高了工效。目前，郧县治山、治水、治土的群众运动，一浪高一浪，一天变一个样。
