Spurred by the spirit of the Great Leap Forward,

    With Each Level Joining Hands in Competition and Each Sector Engaging in Major Collaboration
    Diversified Economy in Shijiazhuang Area Advances Vigorously
    Fourth Quarter Output Value Plan Exceeded by 25 Percent Thirty-Eight Days Ahead of Schedule

    According to the *Hebei Daily*, the Shijiazhuang area has employed the methods of each level joining hands in competition and each sector engaging in major collaboration, pushing diversified economy to a new high tide. Currently, more than 1.64 million people in the entire area are involved in diversified economy, engaging in more than 970 types of production. By November 22nd, the total output value of diversified economy in the entire area reached 300.803 million yuan, exceeding the fourth-quarter output value plan by 25% thirty-eight days ahead of schedule. The average income per person reached 50 yuan, and the average daily income increased by more than two times compared to early November.

    More than 20,000 leading cadres in counties, communes, and teams of the Shijiazhuang Special District have devoted themselves to the diversified economy front, ensuring that counties and communes have leadership organizations, districts and teams have dedicated personnel for management, matters have specialists, and people have specific responsibilities. In order to rapidly push the movement to a high tide, various localities have used wired broadcasting, blackboards, small-scale exhibitions, and other forms of publicity to extensively explain the favorable situation and the important significance of developing diversified economy, combating right-leaning tendencies, and boosting enthusiasm, further stimulating the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members in developing diversified economy.

    The widespread implementation of mutual assistance and competition at every level, along with large-scale collaboration across all sectors, has greatly promoted the high-speed development of diversified economy. During the on-site meeting on diversified economy held by the Prefectural Committee in Xinle County, Hengshui and Shen County, Shulu and Gaocheng, Zhengding and Xinle, Yuanshi and Ningjin, Shijiazhuang City and Pingshan, and other counties and cities launched mutual assistance and competition. After the meeting, mutual assistance and competition, and large-scale collaboration, rapidly spread to various communes, teams, and sectors, transforming into the practical actions of the broad masses of commune members. Xinle and Ningjin counties already have 465 production teams engaged in mutual assistance and competition, implementing large-scale collaboration in raw materials, funds, tools, technology, and other aspects. In Ningjin County, 121 production teams, through mutual assistance and competition, mutually supported seven types of production raw materials, over 10,000 yuan in production funds, over 400 tools, and 346 technicians. The Sujiazhuang Production Team of the Sizilan Commune had willow weaving technology but lacked raw materials. The Zhaojiayangbei Production Team had raw materials but lacked technology. They provided 15,000 jin of willow strips to Sujiazhuang as willow weaving raw materials, and Sujiazhuang also proactively sent four technicians to Zhaojiayangbei to teach the technology. In this way, the production of both teams was very successful.

    In order to further improve production efficiency, various localities have fully utilized the wisdom of the broad masses, boldly innovating and carrying out technological innovation, multiplying production efficiency and greatly increasing income. Hengshui County has utilized local methods to comprehensively utilize multi-eared sorghum stalks on a large scale, already producing more than 771,000 jin of sugar, white wine, vinegar, soy sauce, and other products. Zhengding, Xinle, and other counties, following the trial use of sesame stalks to extract oil, have also utilized peanut shells and bean stalks to extract oil, with an oil yield of 5% to 8%. At the same time, they have modified or created seven types of tools, such as the foot-powered cotton stalk rolling machine. The Fancun, Bajiazhuang, Huayuan, and other production teams of the Chang'an Commune in Shijiazhuang City used wooden rollers to process starch, which increased production efficiency by one time compared to processing with stone mills, and also resulted in a higher powder yield and better quality.

    Commercial departments at all levels actively purchased products, widely sought sales channels, and supported the development of diversified economy from multiple aspects. By November 20th, commercial departments at all levels and various communes and teams in the entire area had signed 2,627 purchase and sales contracts, with a total value of over 33 million yuan, accounting for over 80% of the fourth-quarter purchase plan.

    层层携手赛　行行大协作
    石家庄地区多种经营阔步向前
    提前三十八天超额百分之二十五完成四季度产值计划
    据河北日报报道　石家庄地区运用层层携手赛、行行大协作的办法，把多种经营推向了新高潮。目前全区投入多种经营的一百六十四万多人，搞起了九百七十多种生产。到11月22日，全区多种经营总产值达三亿零八百零三万元，提前三十八天超额25％完成了第四季度产值计划，平均每人收入达五十元，平均日收入比11月初提高两倍多。
    石家庄专区各县、社、队投入多种经营战线的领导干部有两万多人，作到了县、社有领导机构，区、队有专人管理，事有专人，人有专责。为了把运动迅速推向高潮，各地利用有线广播、黑板报、小型展览会等宣传形式，大讲有利形势和开展多种经营的重要意义，反右倾，鼓干劲，进一步激发了广大社员发展多种经营的积极性。
    层层开展携手赛，行行实行大协作，大大促进了多种经营的高速度发展。地委在新乐县召开多种经营现场会议期间，衡水和深县、束鹿和藁城、正定和新乐、元氏和宁晋、石家庄市和平山等县市，就相互展开了携手赛。会后，携手赛、大协作，迅速普及到各个社、队和各个行业，变成了广大社员的实际行动。新乐、宁晋两县已有四百六十五个生产队相互展开了携手赛，在原料、资金、工具、技术等方面实行了大协作。宁晋县有一百二十一个生产队，通过携手赛互相支援了七种生产原料，一万多元生产资金，四百多件工具，三百四十六名技术人员。肆紫兰公社苏家庄生产队有柳编技术，但缺乏原料，赵家杨碑生产队有原料缺乏技术，他们就拿出一万五千斤柳条让苏家庄作柳编原料，苏家庄也主动派出四名技术员到赵家杨碑传授技术。这样，两个队的生产都搞得很好。
    为了进一步提高生产效率，各地充分发挥了广大群众的智慧，大胆创造，进行技术革新，成倍地提高了生产效率，大大增加了收入。衡水县利用土法大搞多穗高粱秸综合利用，已生产出食糖、白酒、醋、酱油等七十七万一千多斤。正定、新乐等县继试用芝麻秸榨油之后，又利用花生皮、豆秸榨出油来，出油率5％到8％。同时，改制或创制了脚蹬轧棉秆机等七种工具。石家庄市长安公社范村、八家庄、花园等生产队，用木料制搓子加工淀粉，比用石磨加工生产效率提高一倍，而且出粉率高，质量好。
    各级商业部门，积极收购产品，广找销路，从多方面支持了多种经营的发展。到11月20日，全区各级商业部门和各社、队签订的收购、推销合同有二千六百二十七份，收购总值达三千三百多万元，占第四季度收购计划的80％以上。（附图片）
