    Colonial Exploitation in South Africa
    Liu Men
    The Union of South Africa is a money tree for the American and British monopoly capital groups in Africa. This April, the Union of South Africa's High Commissioner, Mr. van Erkin, revealed the scale of the colonists' plunder and exploitation of South Africa in a public report.
    From the beginning of reliable records to the end of 1957, imperialists plundered a total of 5.6 billion pounds worth of mineral products from South Africa, equivalent to 16.04 billion US dollars. Imperialists began large-scale mining of South Africa's mineral products in the mid-nineteenth century. Therefore, if the continuous depreciation of the pound over the past century is taken into account, the total amount of imperialist plunder should be much greater than the figure of 6.5 billion pounds.
    South Africa's mineral products are mainly gold. Gold exports account for 40% of the total value of South Africa's exports. Since the discovery of the large gold mines in the Witwatersrand area in the 1870s, the Union of South Africa has produced a total of 580 million troy ounces of gold, worth 4 billion pounds. Due to large-scale plundering over the years, South African gold mine shafts have penetrated deep underground, with the deepest mines reaching 11,000 feet into the strata, making working conditions particularly difficult for workers. At present, the Witwatersrand deposits have been almost completely plundered, but gold deposits in other areas are still very abundant. It is estimated that South Africa's gold production will continue to rise within this century.
    Radioactive raw materials are another important export commodity for South Africa. In 1957, the total value of radioactive raw material exports was 49.8 million pounds. The export price of South African uranium ore is much lower than the international market price. According to agreements between the South African authorities and the United States and Britain, all uranium oxide should be supplied to the United States and Britain, mainly the United States, within ten years.
    South Africa is also rich in diamonds. Diamonds were discovered and mined in South Africa as early as 1867. In 1955, the output of processed jewelry diamonds alone reached 108,000 carats, with a total value of 7.5 million pounds. In addition to large investments in diamond mines, the United States and Britain also control international market diamond prices through the "Diamond Producers Association" and the "Central Sales Organization."
    In addition to the above-mentioned mineral products, South Africa's other mineral exports in 1957 included: 3.5 million pounds of chromite ore, 10.06 million pounds of refined lead, 7.5 million pounds of crude copper, 1.4 million pounds of coal, and 1 million pounds of asbestos. South Africa is also rich in antimony mineral products. In 1957, South Africa produced more than 14,000 tons of antimony ore, with a value of more than 8.5 million pounds. South Africa's antimony production is currently second only to our country, ranking second in the world.
    American and British monopoly groups rely on the cruel exploitation of tens of millions of workers in Africa to obtain profits of billions of pounds. The South African authorities not only use their "Native Labour Organizations" to force local African workers in South Africa to perform slave labor, but also constantly lure African workers from Mozambique, Basutoland, Bechuanaland, Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia, and other places to South Africa to serve as slave workers. The British and Portuguese colonial authorities also extract huge profits from this slave export trade every year.

    在南非的殖民剥削
    柳门
    南非联邦是美英垄断资本集团在非洲的一棵摇钱树。今年4月，南非联邦高级专员万·尔金在一篇公开报告中透露了殖民者对南非掠夺和剥削的规模。
    从有可靠记录起到1957年底止，帝国主义者在南非掠夺的矿产品的总值达五十六亿英镑之多，合一百六十亿四千万美元。帝国主义者是从十九世纪中叶就开始大规模开采南非矿产品的。因此，如果把一个世纪来英镑不断贬值的情况计算在内，帝国主义掠夺的总数应当大大超过六十五亿英镑的数目。
    南非的矿产品主要是黄金。黄金的出口额占南非全部出口品总值的40％。自从十九世纪七十年代在魏特瓦特散德地区发现大金矿时算起，南非联邦共出产黄金达五亿八千万英两，总值四十亿英镑。由于多年来大规模地掠夺。南非金矿矿井都深入地下，最深的矿井竟深入地层一万一千英尺，因此工人劳动条件特别艰苦。目前，魏特瓦特散德矿藏已被掠夺殆尽，但其他地区金矿藏量仍然很丰富。据估计，在本世纪内，南非黄金产量仍将会继续上升。
    放射性物质原料是南非另一重要出口物资。1957年，放射性物质原料出口总值是四千九百八十万英镑。南非的铀矿石出口价格远比国际市场价格为低。根据南非当局和美英两国的协定，在十年内，氧化铀应全部供应美英两国，主要是美国。
    南非也盛产金刚石。1867年，南非即发现金刚石并开始发掘。1955年，仅加工过的饰用金刚石产量即达十万八千克拉，总值七百五十万英镑。美英两国除了在金刚石矿有大量投资外，而且通过“金刚石生产者协会”和“中央销售组织”控制国际市场金刚石价格。
    除上述矿产品外，1957年南非其他矿产品出口有：铬铁矿石三百五十万英镑、精炼铅一千零六十万英镑、粗铜七百五十万英镑、煤一百四十万英镑、石棉一百万英镑。南非锑矿产品也很丰富。1957年南非共生产锑矿石一万四千多吨，产值为八百五十多万镑。南非锑矿产量目前仅次我国，居世界第二。
    美英垄断集团依靠对非洲千万工人的残酷剥削，得到了数以十亿英镑计的利润。南非当局不仅通过它的“土著劳动组织”来强迫南非本地非洲工人进行奴隶劳动，而且不断从莫三鼻给、巴苏陀兰、贝专纳、尼亚萨兰、北罗得西亚等地诱骗非洲工人去南非充当奴隶工人。英国和葡萄牙殖民当局也靠这种奴隶出口买卖每年榨取了巨额利润。
