Vietnam's Three Major Socialist Transformations
　　Zi Qiang

The Vietnamese Labor Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have decided that during the Three-Year Plan period (1958-1960), North Vietnam will strengthen the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. Currently, the Vietnamese people are striving with positive actions to accelerate the realization of this great revolutionary task.

I. Vietnam is an agricultural country, with the agricultural population accounting for more than 90% of the country's total population. Therefore, in the entire socialist transformation undertaking, the transformation of agriculture is the central link.

Vietnam's mutual aid and cooperation movement has a long history. "Joint labor associations" and "labor exchange groups" with socialist characteristics already had a certain foundation in the liberated areas during the Anti-French War. During the economic recovery period from 1954 to 1957, the number of peasant households participating in labor exchange organizations reached 25% of the total number of peasant households, and initial agricultural production cooperatives were established on a trial basis, actively preparing for future agricultural socialist transformation work in terms of ideology, organization, and cadres.

In the work of socialist transformation of agriculture, the class line held by the Vietnamese Labor Party is: "Resolutely rely on poor and lower-middle peasants, closely unite with middle peasants, restrict and even eliminate the economic exploitation of rich peasants, transform the thinking of rich peasants, prevent landlords from raising their heads, continue to give landlords a way out for labor reform and becoming new people, and resolutely guide peasants onto the road of agricultural collectivization to enter socialism." The principles for developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement are: "Voluntary, mutually beneficial, and democratic management." In addition, the Vietnamese Labor Party has also put forward many specific policies aimed at developing agricultural production and raising the socialist consciousness of peasants. The party's formulated line and policies have been wholeheartedly supported by the broad masses of working peasants, promoting the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. At the end of 1958, the number of peasant households participating in agricultural cooperatives accounted for 5% of the total number of peasant households, rising to 21% in the first half of this year. By the end of October this year, it had grown to 38.2%. The Yongling District has basically realized agricultural collectivization; 56% of peasant households in Phu Tho Province have joined cooperatives, and 51.7% in Quang Binh Province....

The development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement has powerfully promoted the technological innovation of agricultural production and ensured the rapid growth of agricultural production. Vietnam's technical requirements for agriculture are: irrigation, fertilization, seed selection, deep plowing, close planting, prevention and control of pests and diseases, and improvement of field management. Obviously, the implementation of these new technical measures must rely on organized strength. Because agricultural cooperatives and various types of labor exchange organizations can rationally allocate labor and break the limitations of small-scale peasant management, civil-run water conservancy projects blossomed everywhere in the first quarter of this year, with the amount of construction exceeding three times the total for the previous year, overcoming the drought; the amount of fertilizer applied in the early rice crop this year exceeded five times that of previous years, deep plowing and close planting were universally promoted, and the extensive and backward farming methods were systematically reformed, thus obtaining a bumper harvest of early rice this year. The role of socialist transformation in promoting agricultural production has once again been verified in practice. At the same time, the development of agricultural production has in turn promoted the development of socialist transformation work. At present, Vietnam's agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement is about to enter a period of comprehensive development climax on the basis of the recent debate on the "two roads" of socialism and capitalism in rural areas.

II. Vietnam's handicrafts are quite developed. During the French rule, in 1941, the most prosperous year for handicrafts, there were 270,000 handicraft workers. After the restoration of peace, due to the strong support of the government, handicrafts have developed unprecedentedly, with the number of employees increasing to more than 400,000 and the number of products exceeding 10,000. In 1958, the output value of handicrafts accounted for 64% of the total output value of industry and handicrafts, becoming the main source of commodities to meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets.

In order to adapt to the needs of further development of the national economy and overcome the backward state of handicrafts in management and production, the Party and the government guided handicraftsmen to gradually embark on the road of organization in accordance with the socialist direction. The forms of organization are currently basically divided into two categories: one is production groups, and the other is cooperatives. At the beginning of this year, there were 17,000 production groups and 260 production cooperatives in North Vietnam; the number of people participating in the two types of organizations reached 43.8% of the total number of employees. The handicrafts industries that have been organized have received support and assistance from state-owned enterprises in terms of raw material supply and product sales, so production has increased many times over. At the same time, the lives of handicraftsmen are more secure than at any time in the past, and their social status has also been unprecedentedly improved. The superiority of cooperative production is becoming increasingly apparent, and the number of people requesting to join the cooperatives is increasing. By mid-August this year, handicraftsmen participating in various types of organizations accounted for 51.8% of the total number of people in the industry, and the number of production cooperatives increased to 625. In areas where handicraftsmen are concentrated, the degree of organization is generally higher than the average proportion, such as Thai Binh Province, where handicraftsmen participating in cooperative organizations account for 80% of the total, Yi An Province accounts for 77%, and Hanoi City accounts for 64.7%.

In view of the fact that the road of organization has provided huge development conditions for handicrafts, the state plan has entrusted handicrafts with glorious and important responsibilities: this year's total output value of handicrafts should increase by 37% compared with last year. In order to complete this glorious task, since the beginning of this summer, handicraft production cooperatives in Hanoi, Haiphong, Nam Dinh, Yongling... and other places have launched production competition movements, mutually proposing challenges to improve product quality and reduce production costs. Driven by this movement, a thriving new atmosphere has emerged in the entire handicraft production sector.

While transforming handicrafts, Vietnam also carried out the socialist transformation of small vendors. At present, the main and common form of Vietnam's transformation of small vendors is the establishment of cooperative groups or cooperative stores, which are divided into the following three forms with varying degrees: private funds, joint purchase and distribution; private funds, joint purchase and joint sales; public funds, joint purchase and joint sales. The specific forms adopted by each industry are voluntarily selected by the participating members, but also taking into account the specific circumstances of different industries and maintaining their operating characteristics to meet the customary needs of society. There are now more than 20,000 small vendors who have participated in various forms of organization, accounting for about half of all employees. At present, the number of small vendors in Vietnam is still too large, exceeding the actual needs of society. While carrying out socialist transformation, the government has formulated a unified arrangement plan to gradually transfer some of them to the production sector.

III. Vietnam's bourgeoisie was born and grew up during the French occupation period, and its characteristics are short history, weak strength, and great dependence on foreign capital. They are divided into two categories: comprador bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie. At the time of the restoration of peace, almost all the comprador bourgeoisie fled to South Vietnam. In the past, the national bourgeoisie was in a humiliating position of being excluded and discriminated against economically and politically. They had both connections and contradictions with imperialism. During the Anti-French War, their political attitude was mostly to remain neutral or support the resistance, and the children of a few capitalists also participated in the resistance. Although the national bourgeoisie is economically and politically very weak, the Vietnamese government still attaches importance to its certain role in the national economy. During the economic recovery period, the Vietnamese government, through the policy of "utilization, restriction, and transformation," guided private industrialists and businessmen to engage in operations that were beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and incorporated a part of the large households with the conditions into the track of state capitalism by means of processing orders, distribution, and agency sales. With the help of the government, all private enterprises have achieved varying degrees of development during the economic recovery period. However, the profit-seeking nature of the bourgeoisie made them "lose their minds for profit." In the spring of 1957, a part of the bourgeois elements in Vietnam launched a rampant attack on the state on the economic front, disrupting the market and seeking exorbitant profits by means of raising prices and hoarding. This illegal and destructive behavior was countered by the government and people of all strata in a concerted manner.

Starting in 1958, the interests of national planned construction required further socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. The strengthening of the state-owned economy, the further consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship, and the improvement of the socialist consciousness of the people of all strata provided favorable conditions for this transformation. Vietnam's transformation of the bourgeoisie adopts peaceful methods and gradually transforms the ownership relationship through joint state-private operation. A redemption policy is adopted for the original means of production of the bourgeoisie, and the form of redemption is fixed interest. At the same time, in the process of transformation, appropriate arrangements are made for the work and life of the capitalists, so as to make the best use of their talents and things, and each gets what they deserve; the transformation of enterprises and the transformation of people are combined to gradually turn capitalists into self-reliant laborers. The booming situation of Vietnam's socialist revolution has also made the bourgeoisie realize that accepting transformation is the only way out. Driven by a part of progressive elements, they have expressed their determination to accept transformation and apply for joint state-private operation of enterprises.

The joint state-private operation of capitalist industry and commerce in North Vietnam began to conduct pilot work at the end of last year, first in industries that are directly related to national construction and people's livelihood. After three batches of pilot projects, it is now being fully rolled out. As of the end of October this year, enterprises that have implemented joint state-private operation in the entire north account for 30% of the total number of capitalist industrial and commercial households. It is estimated that by the end of the year, enterprises with joint state-private operation can reach more than 50% of the total number of capitalist enterprises. At present, some industries in some cities have implemented joint state-private operation of the entire industry. Production in enterprises after joint operation has developed. In the industrial sector, output generally increased by 20% to one time, with an average increase of 30%; in the commercial sector, the relationship between shops after joint operation and state-owned trading companies is closer, sales have generally increased, and the income of many shops has increased by three or four times.

    越南的社会主义三大改造
    自强
    越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府决定：越南北方在三年计划期间（1958—1960年）将加强对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。目前，越南人民正在以积极的行动，为加速实现这一伟大的革命任务而奋斗。一    越南是一个农业国，农业人口占全国人口总数的90％以上。因此，在全部社会主义改造事业中，对农业的改造是中心环节。
    越南的互助合作运动，有相当悠久的历史。带有社会主义萌芽性质的“合工会”、“变工组”，在抗法战争时期的解放区已有一定的基础。在1954—1957年恢复经济时期，参加变工组织的农户，达到农户总数的25％，并着手试办初级农业生产合作社，在思想、组织和干部三方面为以后农业社会主义改造工作作了积极的准备。
    在对农业进行社会主义改造的工作中，越南劳动党所持的阶级路线是：“坚决依靠贫农和下中农，紧密团结中农，限制以至消灭富农的经济剥削，改造富农思想，防止地主抬头，继续给地主以进行劳动改造和成为新人的出路，坚决引导农民走上农业合作化的道路以进入社会主义。”发展互助合作运动的原则是：“自愿、互利和民主管理”。此外，越南劳动党还提出许多旨在发展农业生产和提高农民社会主义觉悟的具体政策。党所拟订的路线、政策受到广大劳动农民的衷心拥护，推动了农业互助合作运动的发展。1958年年底，参加农业合作社的农户占农户总数的5％，今年上半年上升到21％。今年10月底，已经发展到38.2％。永灵区已基本上实现农业合作化；富寿省有56％的农户入了社，广平省有51.7％……。
    互助合作运动的开展，有力地推动了农业生产技术的革新，保证了农业生产的迅速增长。越南对农业的技术要求是：灌溉、施肥、选种、深耕、密植、防治病虫害、改善田间管理。显然，实施这些新技术措施，必须依靠组织起来的力量。由于农业社和各类变工组织能够合理调配劳动力，打破了小农经营的局限性，今年第一季度民办水利工程遍地开花，施工量超过去年全年的三倍，战胜了旱灾；今年早造施肥量超过往年五倍，普遍推行了深耕、密植、系统地改革了粗放、落后的耕作方法，从而获得了今年早稻的特大丰收。社会主义改造对农业生产的促进作用，又一次得到实践的验证。同时，农业生产的发展，又反过来推动社会主义改造工作的开展。目前，越南的农业互助合作运动，在农村中最近展开社会主义和资本主义“两条道路”的辩论的基础上，即将进入全面发展的高潮时期。二    越南的手工业相当发达。在法国统治时期，手工业最兴盛的1941年，手工业者达到二十七万人。和平恢复后，由于政府大力扶助，手工业空前发展，从业人员增至四十多万人，产品万余种。1958年，手工业产值占工业、手工业总产值的64％，成为供应国内外市场需要的主要商品来源。
    为适应国民经济进一步发展的需要，克服手工业在经营和生产方面的落后状态，党和政府按照社会主义方向引导手工业者逐步走上组织起来的道路。组织起来的形式，目前基本上分为两类：一是生产组；一是合作社。今年年初，越南北方有一万七千个生产组，二百六十个生产合作社；参加两类组织的人数达到从业人员总数的43.8％。组织起来以后的手工业行业，在原料供应、产品销售等方面得到国营企业的支持和帮助，因而生产有了成倍的增长。同时，手工业者的生活，比过去任何时期更有保障，社会地位也空前提高。合作生产的优越性日益显著，要求入社人数越来越多，至今年8月中旬，参加各类组织的手工业者占全行业总人数的51.8％，生产合作社增至六百二十五个。在手工业者集中的地区，组织起来的程度一般高于平均的比例，如太平省参加合作组织的手工业者占总数的80％，宜安省占77％，河内市占64.7％。
    鉴于组织起来的道路已经为手工业提供了巨大的发展条件，因此，国家计划赋予手工业以光荣重大的责任：今年手工业总产值要比去年增长37％。为了完成这一光荣任务，今年入夏以来，河内、海防、南定、永灵……等地的手工业生产合作社纷纷发动生产竞赛运动，相互提出提高产品质量、降低生产成本的挑战条件。在这一运动推动下，整个手工业生产部门出现了欣欣向荣新气象。
    在对手工业进行改造的同时，越南还进行了对小商贩的社会主义改造工作。目前，越南改造小商贩的主要和普遍形式是成立合作组或合作商店，其中又以程度高低不同而分为以下三种形式：资金私有，同购分销；资金私有，同购同销；资金公有，同购同销。各行业所采取的具体形式，由参加成员自愿选择，但也要照顾不同行业的具体情况，保持其经营特点，以适应社会的习惯需要。现在已参加各类组织形式的小商贩共有两万多户，占全部从业人员的一半左右。目前越南小商贩的数目仍然过多，超过社会的实际需要，在进行社会主义改造的同时，政府已订出统一安排的计划，使其中一部分人逐渐转入生产部门。三    越南的资产阶级是在法国占领时期诞生和成长起来的，其特点是历史短、实力薄，对外国资本的依附性大。它们之中又分为买办资产阶级和民族资产阶级两类。和平恢复时，几乎所有的买办资产阶级都逃往南越。民族资产阶级过去在经济上和政治上处于被排挤、歧视的屈辱地位，他们同帝国主义既有联系也有矛盾。在抗法战争时期，他们的政治态度多数是保持中立或拥护抗战，少数资本家的子弟还参加了抗战。尽管民族资产阶级在经济上和政治上十分软弱，越南政府仍然重视它在国民经济中的一定作用。在经济恢复时期，越南政府通过“使用、限制和改造”的政策，引导私营工商业者从事有利于国计民生的经营，并将一部分条件具备的大户，以加工订货、经销、代销的方式，纳入国家资本主义轨道。在政府的帮助下，在经济恢复时期，所有私营企业都获得程度不同的发展。但是，资产阶级唯利是图的本性，使他们“利令智昏”。1957年春季，越南一部分资产阶级分子竟在经济战线上向国家展开了猖狂进攻，它们用哄抬物价、囤积居奇等手段扰乱市场，牟取暴利。这种违法破坏行为受到政府和各阶层人民协同一致的反击。
    从1958年开始，国家有计划建设的利益要求对私营工商业进一步实行社会主义改造。国营经济的壮大，人民民主专政政权的更加巩固和各阶层人民社会主义觉悟的提高，给这种改造工作提供了有利条件。越南对资产阶级的改造是采用和平方法，通过公私合营来逐步转变所有制关系。对资产阶级原有的生产资料，采取赎买政策，赎买的形式是定息。同时，在改造过程中，对资本家的工作和生活都予以适当安排，务使人尽其材，物尽其用，各得其所；企业的改造和人的改造结合进行，使资本家逐渐变成自食其力的劳动者。越南社会主义革命事业蓬勃发展的形势，使资产阶级也认识到接受改造是唯一的出路。在一部分进步分子的带动下，他们纷纷表示愿意接受改造的决心，申请企业公私合营。
    越南北方资本主义工商业的公私合营从去年年底开始进行试点工作，首先在对国家建设、人民生活有直接关系的行业中进行。经过三批试点以后，目前正在全面铺开。到今年10月底为止，全北方实行公私合营的企业已占资本主义工商业总户数的30％。预计年底公私合营的企业可达资本主义企业总数的50％以上。目前，有的城市有些行业已经实行了全行业的公私合营。合营后的企业生产都有了发展。在工业方面，产量一般增加20％到一倍，平均增加30％；在商业方面，合营后的商店同国营贸易公司的关系更加密切，销售量普遍提高，不少商店收入增加了三、四倍。
