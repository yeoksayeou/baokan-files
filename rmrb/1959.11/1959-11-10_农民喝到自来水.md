    Farmers Drink Tap Water
    I
    For a thousand years, carrying poles weighed down our shoulders,
    We couldn't finish hauling water from the Yu River (Note).
    Now that tap water is installed,
    Sweet, refreshing river water is delivered to our doorsteps.

    II
    Turn the faucet, and the bucket fills up,
    Clear and transparent, free from disease.
    Everyone drinks tap water,
    Everyone praises the General Line.
    (Farmers from Nankai District, Tianjin)
    Note: "Yu River" is a common name for the Grand Canal.

    农民喝到自来水
    一
    千年扁担压咱肩
    御河（注）河水挑不完
    如今修起自来水
    清甜河水送眼前
    二
    龙头一拧水满担
    清彻透明无病患
    人人喝到自来水
    个个赞扬总路线
    （天津市南开区农民）
    注：“御河”即运河的俗称
