    At the Dongsi Post and Telecommunications Bureau
    The Dongsi Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Beijing is a red banner in the great leap forward in service work for the national postal and telecommunications enterprises. For more than a year, the bureau's staff have always been proactively and enthusiastically serving the masses, and have achieved new successes.
    In order to better serve the Party's central work, since the first half of this year, they have ranked the letters and newspapers of major organs and enterprises as the first and second households on the delivery route, so that they can be delivered ten minutes or half an hour earlier respectively. For large-volume printed materials sent by major organs and enterprises, the number of sealing and dispatching times has been increased. Some of them, which originally had to be sent out the next day, can now be rushed out on the same day, and on-site sealing and dispatching are also implemented when necessary. Telegrams from major organs and enterprises are processed in advance, and the time for delivering a telegram has been shortened from eighty minutes to forty minutes, which is welcomed by organs and enterprises.
    In order to improve services to ordinary residents, they further proposed the slogan of "Four Conveniences" this year. First, convenient for sending. When users have difficulties sending letters and telegrams, the staff will proactively help them solve the problems. For example, once a Mongolian youth came to send a telegram to a certain city in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to inquire about his passport. Gu Huaying, a telecommunications clerk, felt that this matter was very important. Although the young man did not speak Chinese very clearly, she took great pains to understand what he meant and helped him draft the telegram and send it out. Soon, a reply came from the other party. The Mongolian youth was very satisfied and wrote a poem praising Gu Huaying. Second, convenient for receiving. For users who have difficulty going out, they proactively collect remittances and parcels on their behalf. In September, the bureau's delivery staff collected 338 parcels and remittances on behalf of users. Third, convenient for ordering. If the magazine that the reader wants to buy is sold out, the staff will record it in the out-of-stock registration book and look for it in many ways. A patient in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital asked mobile service personnel Zheng Huimin to buy a magazine. Zheng Huimin ran to several bookstores, but could not find it. After a week, he still remembered this matter and found it in a bookstore and sent it to the patient. Because of his thoughtful service, forty-five patients in the hospital jointly wrote a letter praising him, saying that he was the patient's "inseparable friend." Fourth, convenient for inquiry. During the great leap forward in service work last year, they did not pay enough attention to this issue, and some inquiry forms had been received for several days without being processed. Now, when users come to inquire, they are all processed on the same day.

    在东四邮电局
    北京东四邮电局是全国邮电企业服务工作大跃进的一面红旗。一年多来，这个局的职工始终主动热情地为群众服务，又取得了新成绩。
    为了更好地为党的中心工作服务，从今年上半年起，他们把主要机关企业的信件、报刊，都排在投递路线的第一、二户，这样就可以分别提前十分钟或半小时送到；对于主要机关企业交寄的大宗印刷品，增加了封发次数，有些本来要第二天才发出去的，现在当天可以赶出，必要时还实行上门封发。主要机关企业的电报都提前处理，投送一份电报的时间，从八十分钟缩短到四十分钟，受到机关企业的欢迎。
    为了改进对一般居民的服务，今年他们进一步提出了“四方便”的口号。第一，交寄方便。用户寄信发电报，发现有困难时，营业员就主动帮助解决。比如，有一次一个蒙族青年来打电报到内蒙古自治区某市，查问他的出国证件。电信营业员顾华英，觉得这事情很重要，虽然那位青年汉语说得不很清楚，她还是费了大劲，弄清楚了他的意思，帮助他拟了电稿发了出去。不久，对方就来了答复。那位蒙族青年非常满意，写了一首诗表扬顾华英。第二，领取方便。对出门有困难的用户，他们主动代取汇款、包裹。这个局的投递员在9月份就为用户代取了三百三十八件包裹、汇款。第三，订购方便。读者要买的杂志卖完了，营业员就在缺刊登记本上记下来，多方寻找。中医医院有一个病人，委托流动服务人员郑惠民买一本杂志。郑惠民跑了几个书店，都没找到。过了一个星期，他仍惦记着这件事，在一家书店里找到了，给病人送去。由于他服务周到，这个医院的四十五个病人联名写信表扬他，说他是病人的“不可分离的朋友”。第四，查询方便。去年服务工作大跃进中，他们对这个问题注意不够，有些查单来了几天，还没处理。现在用户来查询，都做到当天处理了。
