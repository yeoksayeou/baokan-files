The commodity production bases in Heilongjiang Province have initially formed a complete system and are developing in the direction of connecting various bases into lines and forming a network of large and small bases. Currently, there are more than 190 state-owned commodity bases established by the province, city, and county levels.

    Yarsey Farm
    Yarsey Farm is the first state-owned non-staple food production base in Heilongjiang Province.
    This farm has opened up a "hundred vegetable garden" on the fertile Nenjiang Plain. In addition to local autumn rape, there are also more than 10,000 kinds of vegetables such as Fujian cauliflower and Sichuan winter melon. The northern part of the farm is a vast grassland, raising more than 30,000 pigs, 4,000 cattle, and sheep.
    This year, the non-staple food base supplied the market with more than 50 million jin of vegetables and fruits, 2,520 fat pigs, 50,000 chickens, and 170,000 jin of eggs.

    Jingpo Aquaculture Farm
    Jingpo Lake is rich in lake crucian carp with large bodies, fat meat, and delicious taste. Since the state transformed the fishery into an aquaculture farm in 1955, it has built 450 mu of artificial breeding ponds, renovated several thousand mu of stocking farms, added steamships, automobiles, cold-water fish incubation rooms, and various large-scale netting equipment, and released more than 50 million artificially incubated carp, fine-scaled fish, grass carp, Yangtze River bream, and silver carp fry.

    Red Prairie Ranch
    There is a large prairie in Anda County, Heilongjiang Province, which is a rare and good natural pasture in our country. It has now become a dairy product production base in Heilongjiang Province.
    In this large ranch, the state has established a livestock farm called "Red Prairie." The livestock farm here and the dairy cows raised by several nearby counties total more than 7,000, with a high milk yield, averaging 6,200 jin of milk per head per year. The milk is supplied to the Anda Dairy Factory and several local small dairy factories to make dairy products such as milk powder for market supply.

    副食品的基地群
    黑龙江省的商品生产基地，已初步形成一个完整体系，并正在向着各种基地联成线、大小基地结成网的方向发展。现在，由省、市、县三级建立的国营商品基地已达一百九十多处。
    雅尔塞农场
    雅尔塞农场是黑龙江省第一个国营副食品生产基地。
    这个农场在肥沃的嫩江平原开辟了一个“百菜园”，这里除种有当地的秋油菜外，还有福建菜花、四川冬瓜等一万多种蔬菜。农场北部是辽阔的草原，饲养了三万多头猪，四千多只牛和羊。
    今年这个副食品基地给市场提供了五千多万斤蔬菜、瓜果，二千五百二十口肥猪，五万只鸡，十七万斤鸡蛋。
    镜泊养殖场
    镜泊湖盛产体大、肉肥、味美的湖鲫。从一九五五年国家把渔场改建为水养殖场以来，修建了四百五十亩人工育苗池，改建了几千亩放养场，添置了汽船、汽车、冷水鱼孵育室和各种大型网具，投放了人工孵育的鲤鱼、细鳞鱼、草鱼、长江青、鲢鱼等五千多万尾鱼苗。
    红色草原牧场
    黑龙江省安达县境内有一块大草原，它是我国罕见的一个良好的天然牧场。这里现在已经成为黑龙江省乳制品生产基地了。
    在这个大牧场里，国家设立了一个名叫“红色草原”的畜牧农场。这里的畜牧场和临近几个县饲养的乳牛，共达七千多头，产乳量很高，平均每头年产牛奶六千二百斤。牛奶供给安达乳品厂和当地几个小型奶品工厂，做成乳粉等乳制品，供应市场。
