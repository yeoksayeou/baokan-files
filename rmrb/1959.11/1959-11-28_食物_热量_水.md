    Food · Heat · Water
    Most of the food people eat is converted into heat. When a person is sound asleep, an adult emits enough heat in one day and night to raise the temperature of about three tons of water by one degree, or to bring two buckets of water with a capacity of thirty liters to a boil.
                        ＊　　　＊　　＊
    Everyone believes that water cannot be compressed. In fact, this is not entirely correct. For example, under a pressure of one thousand atmospheres, the volume of water is reduced by approximately 5%. If seawater were not subject to pressure, its water level could rise by thirty meters, at which point vast areas would be flooded by the sea. 〔Compiled by Zhi Neng〕

    食物·热量·水
    人吃下去的食物，大部分的能变为热量。在熟睡的情况下，一个成年人一昼夜发出的热量足够使三吨左右的水增加一度温度，或者使容量三十公升的两桶水达到沸点。

    大家都认为：水是不能压缩的。其实，这并不十分正确。例如，在一千个大气压下，水的容积大致缩减5％。如果海水毫不受到压力，那么它的水位可以升高三十米，那时候，广大的地方都要被海水淹没了。　　　　　　　　　　〔治能编译〕
