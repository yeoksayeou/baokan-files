    Hopes for Writers Going to the Countryside
    I learned from the newspapers that many writers, in order to further strengthen their connection with the masses, are determined to continue to delve into the people's communes in various places, using authentic descriptions to reflect the life of the communes. I believe that after the writers go deep into the countryside, they will write more and better works. I also hope that after the writers go to the countryside, they will write more news reports, features, reports, and essays for the newspapers. I remember that during the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and last year's Great Leap Forward, writers wrote many articles for the newspapers. Some outstanding works were widely circulated and played a significant role in inspiring people. Today, as new miracles continue to emerge in our countryside, writers, quickly depict them with your pens!

    对下乡作家的希望
    从报纸上得知许多作家为了进一步加强同群众的结合，决心继续深入到各地人民公社中，用真实的描写来反映公社的生活。相信作家们在深入农村后，一定会写出更多更好的作品。我还希望作家们下乡后多给报纸写一点通讯、特写、报告、散文。记得抗美援朝时期和去年大跃进中，作家们曾经给报纸写了许多文章。一些出色的作品，到处传诵，发挥了重大的鼓舞作用。今天当我们的农村不断出现新的奇迹的时候，作家们，用你们的笔迅速地把它描绘出来吧！
