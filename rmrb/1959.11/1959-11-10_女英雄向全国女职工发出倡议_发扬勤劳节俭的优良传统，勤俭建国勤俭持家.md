Xinhua News Agency, 9th — The 796 female advanced producers attending the National Congress of Heroes held a meaningful gathering this morning. These female advanced producers from all walks of life issued a proposal to female employees and employees' families across the country at the meeting. They called on female employees and employees' families to hold high the red flag of the General Line, ensure and overfulfill this year's national economic plan in all aspects, and create new achievements in the continued Great Leap Forward in 1960.
The proposal calls on female employees on the production front to strive for high output, high quality, low consumption, and safety, and to comprehensively overfulfill the state plan; women on the finance and trade, culture, education, health, and living service fronts should be proficient in their work, improve work efficiency and service quality; and employees' families should strive to support production and participate in production.
The proposal requires all female employees and employees' families to break the inferiority and dependence thinking left over from the old society for thousands of years, work hard to learn cultural and scientific knowledge, actively participate in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and promote the characteristics of women's ingenuity; continue to promote the fine traditions of hard work and frugality in production, work, and life, and achieve national construction through diligence and thrift, and manage the family through diligence and thrift; vigorously run collective living welfare undertakings, and gradually realize the socialization of household labor; and educate children with communist spirit. The proposal also requires all female employees and employees' families to always listen to the Party and serve socialist construction wholeheartedly.
Today, among the 796 female advanced producers gathered together, there are female models who have not been absent from work for ten years and have always overfulfilled their tasks; there are female red flag bearers who are constantly inventing and always ahead of time; there are female heroes who are selfless in defending national property; there are female advanced workers who work hard and serve diligently; there are female engineering and technical personnel who are both red and expert; there are the first generation of female minority workers; and there are employees' families who actively serve production and life. The growth and development of these female advanced producers vividly shows that the vast number of women in our country have become a strong force in the cause of socialist construction. At present, the number of female employees nationwide has increased to more than 7 million, more than ten times higher than before liberation.
Today, Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, Vice-Chairmen Deng Yingchao, Xu Guangping, Shi Liang, Zhang Yun, Kang Keqing, Luo Qiong, First Secretary of the Secretariat, and Zhang Xiaomei, Chairman of the Beijing Women's Federation, met with them, had cordial conversations with them, and took photos with them.
The Beijing Children's Peking Opera Troupe performed wonderful programs for the female advanced producers at the meeting.

    倡议书号召生产战线上的女职工，要努力做到高产、优质、低耗、安全，全面超额完成国家计划；财贸文教卫生、生活服务等战线上的妇女，要精通业务，提高工作效率和服务质量；职工家属们要努力支援生产和参加生产。
    倡议书要求全体女职工和职工家属打破几千年来旧社会遗留给妇女的自卑依赖思想，努力学习文化和科学知识，积极参加技术革新和技术革命运动，发扬妇女心灵手巧的特长；在生产、工作、生活上继续发扬勤劳节俭的优良传统，做到勤俭建国、勤俭持家；大力办好集体生活福利事业，逐步实现家务劳动社会化；以共产主义精神教育子女。倡议书还要求全体女职工和职工家属永远听党的话，全心全意为社会主义建设服务。
