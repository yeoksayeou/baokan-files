U.S. "Aid" Is a Real Swindle
Latin American Figures Denounce U.S. Economic Plunder

This newspaper comprehensively reports: Latin American political and economic figures continue to expose and criticize the infiltration and plunder by U.S. monopoly capital.

Argentine economist, Fox, in his recently published article in the "New Era" magazine and in his book "Who Is the Economic Master of Argentina," exposed the infiltration of foreign monopoly capital, particularly U.S. monopoly capital, into the Argentine economy and the large-scale seizure of profits. Fox said that foreign capital has infiltrated and controlled Argentina's industry, mining, public utilities, import and export trade, finance, and the meat industry, which occupies an important position in the Argentine economy. Among foreign investments, U.S. monopoly capital ranks first, accounting for 40% of the total foreign investment, while Britain accounts for 22%.

Fox pointed out that the dominance of foreign monopoly organizations and financial oligarchs of big capitalists in the Argentine economy has a fatal impact on the entire national life of Argentina. This dominance prevents the harmonious development of the economy, hinders the exploitation of natural resources, and leads to the decline of agricultural production, the shrinkage of foreign trade markets, and domestic crises, etc. Fox pointed out that the current situation promotes the wealth and prosperity of foreign monopoly organizations. According to the report materials of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, for every dollar invested in Argentina in the past forty years, a profit of four dollars and ninety cents can be obtained. In addition, foreign monopoly organizations are increasingly making amazing profits by buying Argentine commodities at low prices and selling their own commodities at high prices. Therefore, in the past fifty-seven years, Argentina has been plundered of wealth amounting to 19,002,400,000 U.S. dollars.

Recently, due to the fierce protests of the Argentine people and deputies of various parties, the U.S. monopoly capital's attempt to force Argentina to transfer state-owned enterprises to private operation (one of the conditions for the "International Monetary Fund" to loan to Argentina) was frustrated. The Argentine government had to submit a memorandum to the Senate, stating that the government "has no intention of selling certain state-owned enterprises" and "will continue to maintain the status quo that allows state-owned and private enterprises to coexist."

Che Guevara, the Cuban rebel leader of Argentine origin, in a recent audio speech to his homeland people, accused the "International Monetary Fund" of hindering the economic development of Latin America. He said that the role of the "International Monetary Fund" "is to ensure the control of some [foreign] capital over the entire Americas." He said that this organization "is a huge international consortium based in Wall Street."

Colombian congressmen Lozano Garcés and Romero Hernán, together with the advisory office of the "Committee for the Nationalization of Oil," submitted a bill to the parliament in early November, stipulating restrictions on the privileges currently enjoyed by American companies in Colombia. The implementation of this bill would bring Colombia more than 90 million U.S. dollars in annual revenue. This bill has been supported by oil unions, the press, and people from all walks of life. On November 3, the Colombian Senate discussed a bill proposed by the government, requesting the parliament to authorize the government to sign a 250 million U.S. dollar loan agreement with the United States. Senator Alfonso Palacio Rudas pointed out in his speech that "the entire international mechanism of the U.S. government to aid underdeveloped countries is a real swindle." He condemned the so-called "economic missions" sent by the United States, saying, "They no longer send Marines to invade us as they did to Nicaragua; however, they send a large army of economic experts to invade us." Palacio Rudas emphasized that the 250 million U.S. dollar loan is detrimental to Colombia.

The head of the Venezuelan government delegation, Jovito Villalba, who is visiting Brazil, gave a speech in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies, exposing the fact that the United States manipulates and lowers raw material prices, causing Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Cuba to suffer trade deficits. According to materials published by the Brazilian Ministry of Finance, due to the decline in the prices of Brazil's main export products, there was a serious situation of an import surplus of 124.5 million U.S. dollars from January to August this year. Jovito Villalba said that Venezuela supports any initiative proposed by the Brazilian government aimed at stabilizing the prices of raw materials exported by Brazil and Latin American countries. Prior to this, Jovito Villalba, at a press conference during a visit to Argentina, called on Latin American countries to cooperate in defending their economic interests and to protect the prices of Latin American raw materials.

Cuban Minister of Commerce Raúl Cepero Bonilla condemned the United States on a television roundtable on the evening of the 10th, saying that the United States' move to cut Cuba's sugar quota in the U.S. market is economic aggression and economic retaliation against Cuba.

He emphasized that "when the Cuban government continues to follow its established path, the United States threatens to lower the sugar quota. In fact, Cuba's sugar quota in the United States is not a favor given to us by the United States, but the only compensation it receives from the many preferential tariff rights enjoyed by the United States [in Cuba]. At the same time, this quota also guarantees the U.S. import market in Cuba."

### 美“援”是一个真正骗局  拉丁美洲各国人士抨击美国经济掠夺

    美“援”是一个真正骗局
    拉丁美洲各国人士抨击美国经济掠夺
    本报综合报道　拉丁美洲政界和经济界人士继续揭露和抨击美国垄断资本的渗入和掠夺。
    阿根廷著名经济学家福克斯在不久前出版的“新纪元”杂志上发表文章和他写的“谁是阿根廷的经济主人”一书中，揭露外国垄断资本，特别是美国垄断资本渗入阿根廷经济和大量攫取利润的情形。福克斯说，外国资本渗入并且控制了阿根廷的工业、矿业、公用事业、进出口贸易、金融业和在阿根廷经济中占重要地位的肉类工业。在外国投资中，美国垄断资本占了首位，即占外国投资总额的40％，英国占22％。
    福克斯指出，外国垄断组织和大资本家的金融寡头在阿根廷经济中的统治对阿根廷整个国民生活有着致命的影响。这一统治阻止了经济的和谐发展，妨碍了开拓自然财富，并导致农业生产的衰退，对外贸易市场的缩小和国内危机等等。福克斯指出，目前的情况促使外国垄断组织发财致富。根据联合国拉丁美洲经济委员会的报告材料，最近四十年来在阿根廷每投资一块美元，就可取得四块九角美元的利润。此外，外国垄断组织用低价购买阿根廷商品，用高价卖出自己的商品的办法，日益获得惊人的利润。因此，在最近五十七年来，阿根廷被掠夺的财富就达一百九十亿零二千四百万美元。
    最近，由于阿根廷人民和各党派议员的激烈抗议，美国垄断资本企图迫使阿根廷把国营企业转让给私人经营（这是“国际货币基金组织”贷款给阿根廷的条件之一）的计划遭到挫折。阿根廷政府不得不交给参议院一个备忘录，表示政府“没有出售某些国营企业的意图”，并且“将继续保持允许国营和私营共存的现状”。
    原籍阿根廷的古巴起义军领袖格瓦拉在最近向他的祖国人民发表的录音演说中，指责“国际货币基金组织”阻碍了拉丁美洲的经济发展。他说，“国际货币基金组织”的作用“是保证一些（外国）资本对整个美洲的控制”。他说，这个组织“是一个以华尔街作基地的巨大的国际财团”。
    哥伦比亚国会议员洛萨诺·加塞斯和罗梅罗·埃尔南在11月初同“争取石油国有化委员会”顾问处一起向议会提出一个法案，规定限制目前在哥伦比亚的美国公司所享的特权。实施这个法案将使哥伦比亚每年收益九千多万美元。这个法案得到石油工会、报界和各阶层人民的支持。在11月3日哥伦比亚参议院讨论政府提出的、要求议会授权政府同美国签订二亿五千万美元的贷款协定的法案。参议员阿方索·帕拉西奥·鲁达斯在发言中指出，“美国政府援助不发达国家的整个国际机构是一个真正的骗局”。他谴责美国派出的所谓“经济使团”说，“他们已经不像对尼加拉瓜那样派海军陆战队来侵略我们了，然而，却派遣了经济专家的大军来侵略我们。”帕拉西奥·鲁达斯强调指出，二亿五千万美元的贷款对哥伦比亚是不利的。
    正在巴西访问的委内瑞拉政府特派代表团团长霍维托·比利亚耳瓦在巴西众议院发表讲话，揭露美国操纵和压低原料价格使巴西、哥伦比亚、阿根廷和古巴造成贸易逆差。据巴西财政部公布的材料，由于巴西主要出口产品价格的下降，造成今年1月份到8月份入超一亿二千四百五十万美元的严重情况。霍维托·比利亚耳瓦说，委内瑞拉支持巴西政府提出的任何旨在稳定巴西和拉丁美洲国家出口原料价格的倡议。在这以前，霍维托·比利亚耳瓦在访问阿根廷时举行的一次记者招待会上，呼吁拉丁美洲各国必须为保卫它们的经济利益方面进行合作，必须保护拉丁美洲的原料的价格。
    古巴商业部长劳尔·塞佩罗·博尼利亚10日晚在电视圆桌会议上谴责美国说，美国要削减美国市场上的古巴食糖份额，就是对古巴的经济侵略和经济报复。
    他强调指出，“当古巴政府继续走它既定的道路的时候，美国就扬言要降低食糖份额。实际上，古巴在美国的食糖份额并不是美国给我们的优待，而是它从美国（在古巴）享有的许多优惠的关税权利方面，所得到的唯一补偿。同时，这个份额也保证了美国在古巴的进口市场。”
