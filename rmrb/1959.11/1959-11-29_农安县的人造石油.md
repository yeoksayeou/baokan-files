Nongan County, Jilin Province is located north of Changchun City, Jilin Province, and is a flat area with convenient transportation. The county covers an area of 5,000 square kilometers, and shale is widely found with extremely rich underground reserves.

In 1958, the central government issued the call to vigorously develop industry. In July of that year, Nongan County built two semi-indigenous and semi-foreign artificial petroleum factories under conditions of extreme lack of technology, equipment, and materials, revealing the secret of petroleum and setting a banner for the county's petroleum industry. On this basis, through on-site meetings and organized visits, a high tide of mass-run petroleum industry was launched. In three months, a total of 128 small-scale oil refineries were built, including 80 with an annual output of 300 tons, 14 with 200 tons, 33 with 100 tons, and 1 with 5,000 tons. Distributed in Yong'an, Fulongquan, Kaoshan, Zuojiashan and other places, they formed four petroleum clusters, with an annual production capacity of 35,100 tons, plus the two 3,000-ton oil mines under construction, the production capacity can reach more than 40,000 tons. The products that have been successfully tested now include: gasoline for vehicles, light and heavy diesel, paraffin wax, asphalt, transformer oil, spindle oil, lubricating oil, carbon black, plastics, and more than 40 other products.

At the beginning of the factory construction, some people had the idea of ​​being ambitious and fond of the new, and disliking the indigenous and liking the foreign. In response to this idea, we conscientiously implemented the policy of small and medium-sized as the main, simple as the main, and serving agricultural production as the main; at the same time, we launched debates, criticized the idea of ​​loving the foreign and being ambitious and divorced from reality, advocated starting from scratch in a simple way, and implemented the method of planning, building factories, and producing at the same time. Without mechanical equipment, we first engaged in earthwork projects, built dry distillation piles, and waited for the mechanical power to be resolved before putting them into production.

When construction of the oil refineries began, some people had the idea of ​​running the petroleum factory exclusively, divorced from the masses, believing that the masses did not understand technology and could not run industry. After the county party committee discovered these ideas, it insisted on the policy of relying on the masses and called on everyone to take action and strive for "over 100 oil factories." Under the call of the county party committee, the enthusiasm of various systems to vigorously develop industry was mobilized. The army, the Commercial Bureau, schools, and various communes invested in factory construction activities. When funds and equipment were insufficient, the method of taking the mass line was adopted, which was quickly resolved. The masses in four communes, including Wanjinta, found more than 500 meters of steel pipe, solving the problem of induction pipes for eight factories; Fulongquan Township relied on the masses to solve the funding problem.

Self-reliance and strengthening collaboration are important keys to accelerating the progress of factory construction. In the case of insufficient technical strength, we adopted the method of large-scale collaboration, organized the existing installation technicians, and established installation teams and technical guidance groups, and went wherever there were problems. This solved the technical problems in factory construction, installation and test runs. In terms of equipment, we also achieved common collaboration and mutual exchange of what was needed.

This year, Nongan's petroleum production has seen new developments, with the county's crude oil production rising linearly and costs continuing to fall. The crude oil production of 13 commune-run petroleum factories in the second quarter was 396 tons, and it rose to 958 tons in the third quarter. The cost of each ton of crude oil has been reduced from 700 yuan in the early days of factory construction to 180 yuan.

At present, the county's petroleum workers are fighting for the production of 1,548 tons of crude oil in the fourth quarter.

    农安县的人造石油
    吉林省农安县副县长　张文卿
    农安县位于吉林省长春市北部，是一个交通方便的平原地带。全县面积五千平方公里，普遍发现页岩，地下埋藏量极为丰富。
    1958年，中央提出了大办工业的号召，当年7月，农安县在技术和设备物资等非常缺乏的条件下，建起了两座半土半洋人造石油厂，揭破了石油的秘密，给全县石油工业树立了旗帜。在这个基础上，通过现场会议，组织参观，又掀起了群众办石油工业的高潮，三个月共建成一百二十八座小型炼油厂，其中：年产三百吨的八十座、二百吨十四座、一百吨三十三座、五千吨一座。分布在永安、伏龙泉、靠山、左家山等地，组成四个石油群，全年生产能力三万五千一百吨，再加上正在施工的两个三千吨的石油矿，生产能力可达四万多吨。现在已经试验成功的产品有：车用汽油、轻、重柴油、石蜡、沥青、变压器油、锭子油、润滑油、炭黑、塑料等四十多种产品。
    建厂开始，有些人存在着好大喜新、厌土喜洋的思想。针对这种思想，我们认真地贯彻了中小为主、简易为主、为农业生产服务为主的方针；同时展开了辩论，批判了喜洋好大脱离实际的思想，提倡因陋就简、白手起家，实行边规划、边建厂、边生产的办法。没有机械设备，就先搞土方工程，修好干馏堆，等待机械动力解决后，投入生产。
    开始建设炼油厂时，有些人存在着脱离群众独家搞石油厂的思想，认为群众不懂技术，不能办工业。县委发现这些思想以后，坚持依靠群众的方针，号召大家动手，为“油厂过百”而奋斗。在县委的号召下，各系统大办工业的积极性都调动起来了。军队、商业局、学校和各公社投入了办厂的活动。资金和设备不够，采取走群众路线的方法，很快就解决了。万金塔等四个公社，群众找出了五百多米钢管，解决了八个厂的诱导管问题；伏龙泉乡依靠群众解决了资金问题。
    自力更生，加强协作，是加速建厂进度的重要关键。在技术力量不足的情况下，我们采取了大协作的办法，把现有的安装技术人员组织起来，成立安装队和技术指导小组，哪里有问题就到哪里去。从而解决了建厂、安装试车当中的技术问题。设备方面，也作到了共同协作、互通有无。
    今年农安的石油生产有了新的发展，全县原油产量直线上升、成本不断下降。十三个社办石油厂第二季度原油产量是三百九十六吨，第三季度就上升到九百五十八吨。每吨原油成本由建厂初期的七百元，降低到一百八十元。
    目前，全县石油工人正为第四季度生产一千五百四十八吨原油而奋斗。
