Adapting to Engineering Needs Requires Continuous Tool Reform
Zhanghe Reservoir Construction Site Reforms Tools According to Time and Local Conditions, Increasing Efficiency More Than Four Times

    (Our report) The construction site Party committee of the Zhanghe Reservoir in Jingzhou Prefecture, Hubei Province, mobilized the masses to vigorously carry out tool reform. Now, from loading and unloading to transportation, from excavation to rolling, many kinds of high-efficiency tools have emerged, increasing the average efficiency by 4.43 times compared to the original.
    The Zhanghe Reservoir is a large-scale water conservancy project that began construction last winter. The entire project includes two main dams (more than 50 meters high), two auxiliary dams, one main canal, and four branch canals, with a total earth and stone volume of 32 million cubic meters. After the reservoir is completed, the water storage capacity will reach 1.58 billion cubic meters. After a winter and spring of hard work by 40,000 civilian laborers, the main dam project is now half completed. Due to the heavy task and insufficient labor, the construction site Party committee led the masses to vigorously carry out tool reform from the beginning of construction. In the process of reform, they adhered to the principle of "taking soil as the main material, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and adapting to local conditions and engineering needs," and improved the enthusiasm of the masses through methods such as conducting experiments and establishing models.
    Closely following the needs of the project's progress and carrying out tool reform according to local conditions and engineering requirements is a major feature of the tool reform at the Zhanghe Reservoir project. That is: tool reform progresses wherever the project progresses; whatever tools are needed based on the characteristics of the terrain, those tools are reformed; everyone reforms, every day reforms, testing while promoting, constantly testing, and constantly promoting. When the project was in the "foundation clearing" stage, the focus was on promoting aerial cableways and track winches due to the engineering characteristics of riverbed operation. When the project shifted to the "backfilling" of the dam, the focus was on tool reform centered on transportation tools. In the reform of transportation tools, the main goal was to eliminate shoulder carrying. To this end, the masses were mobilized to manufacture various types of vehicles and "foot-operated water-turning board boats" suitable for mass operation. In order to load more and run faster, the masses were mobilized to convert small carts into large carts, increasing the load capacity from 300 jin to 600-800 jin. In areas where conditions permitted, wooden tracks were laid, and large dump trucks were used, with a load capacity of 4,000 to 5,000 jin at a time, increasing efficiency by 60 to 70 times compared to manual labor. After the transportation efficiency was improved, in order to make the loading and unloading work adapt to it, the masses successfully trial-produced soil stockpiling devices suitable for various terrain characteristics, with an average efficiency five times higher than manual labor. In order to improve soil digging efficiency, "traction plows" were promoted on flat ground, "pile-driving soil collapse devices" were promoted on high ground and convex ground, and "sky pestle type drilling machines" were promoted in stone areas, with efficiency six to eight times higher than manual labor.
    Because tool reform is constantly being carried out, over the past year, the Zhanghe Reservoir project has developed from nine tool factories to 121 tool factories and 145 construction site repair stations, and has also successively established three shipyards and two ball bearing factories. The technical team has also grown from 120 people to 2,496 people. During the movement, the masses contributed 9,200 ideas, reformed more than 300 kinds of tools, produced 150,642 double-wheeled trolleys, single-wheeled trolleys, wooden dump trucks, winches and other various vehicles, 568 wooden boats, repaired more than 165,000 meters of wooden track, more than 48,500 meters of wooden plank roads, installed 3,600 meters of aerial cableways, made 1,630 derricks, 17,563 soil collapse devices, 363 soil stockpiling devices, 33,261 sets of ball bearings, and many other tools, effectively ensuring the needs of the project's progress.

    Two kinds of transportation tools created at the Zhanghe Reservoir construction site
    Deep Ditch Winch Soil Transportation Device
    A vertical winch should be located on the slope, with a wheel disc diameter of 8 decimeters, a height of 7 decimeters, a round shaft diameter of 18 to 20 centimeters, and a winch frame diameter of 90 to 100 centimeters. Double wooden tracks are laid along the slope, and a four-wheeled pulley is used to winch up and down the track for transportation. The rear wheel diameter of the pulley should be twice as large as the front wheel to adjust the load-bearing center of gravity. A total of six people operate it. Four people winch on the slope, and two people load soil at the bottom of the slope. Calculated on the basis of 10 hours per day, it can transport 30 to 50 times, with each person contributing 1.4 cubic meters of soil.

                     Wooden Rail Dump Truck
    The form is like a light railway dump truck, and the rails are all made of wood. Iron sheets, bamboo strips, etc. should be nailed to the rail surface to reduce friction resistance. Crossroads are laid with turnouts. There are many types of car buckets, such as square box buckets, turntable buckets, cabinet buckets, and flying buckets, with the square box bucket being simple and easy to use. One to two people push the car. Soil platforms, unloading slides, and other tools are installed at the soil loading and unloading sites. This kind of water rail dump truck is suitable for flat or slightly sloping ground. Each car carries 800 to 1200 jin. The efficiency per person per day is 5 to 8 times higher than carrying on the shoulder.

    适应工程需要不断改革工具
    漳河水库工地因时因地制宜改革工具提高工效四倍多
    本报讯　湖北省荆州专区漳河水库的工地党委，发动群众大搞工具改革，现在从装卸到运输，从挖掘到碾压，出现了很多种高工效工具，使平均工效比原来提高四点四三倍。
    漳河水库是去年冬天开工兴建的大型水利工程。整个工程有两座主坝（高五十多米的）、两座副坝和一条总干渠、四条支干渠，全部土、石方为三千二百万立方米，水库建成后蓄水量可达到十五亿八千万立方米。经过四万民工一个冬春的奋战，现在主坝工程已完成一半。由于任务大，劳力不足，工地党委在开始施工时就领导群众大搞工具改革。在改革过程中，坚持“以土为主、土洋结合、因地因工程制宜”的方针，并通过搞试验、立样板等方法，提高了群众的积极性。
    紧紧根据工程进展的需要，因地因工程制宜开展工具改革，是漳河水库工程开展工具改革的一个重大特点。这就是：工程进展到哪里，工具改革到哪里，地势特点需要什么工具，就改革什么工具，人人改，天天改，边试验，边推广，不断试验，不断推广。当工程处于“清基”时期，由于工程特点是河床操作，便着重推广了空中滑丝和轨道绞车。当工程转入大坝“回填”时期，便着重开展了以运输工具为中心的工具改革。在运输工具改革中，主攻方向是消灭肩挑，为此便发动群众制造各种各样车辆和适合群众操作的“脚踏翻水板船”。为了多装快跑，又发动群众把小车改大车，载重量由三百斤提高为六百到八百斤。有条件的地方还铺设木轨道，改用大斗车，一次载重四千到五千斤，比人工工效提高六、七十倍。运输工效提高后，为了使装卸工作与之相适应，又发动群众试制成功了适合各种地形特点的囤土器，平均工效比人工高五倍。为了提高挖土工效，在平地推行“牵引犁”，在高地、凸地推行“排桩崩土器”，在石方地区推广“天硪式打眼器”，工效比人工提高六到八倍。
    由于工具改革在不断进行，一年多以来，漳河水库工程已由九个工具厂发展到一百二十一个工具厂和一百四十五个工地修配站，还相继办起了三个造船厂、两个滚珠轴承厂。技术队伍也由一百二十人发展到二千四百九十六人。在运动中，群众共献计九千二百条，改革了各种工具三百多种，生产了双轮板车、单轮板车、木斗车、绞车等各种车辆十五万零六百四十二部、木船五百六十八只，修木轨道十六万五千多米、木板路四万八千五百多米、搞天线滑丝三千六百米，制吊杆一千六百三十根、崩土器一万七千五百六十三个、囤土器三百六十三个、滚珠轴承三万三千二百六十一套，以及许多其他工具，有力地保证了工程进展的需要。（附图片）
    漳河水库工地创造的两种运输工具
    深沟绞车运土器
    坡上要有一直立绞车，车盘直径八分米，高七分米，圆轴直径十八至二十厘米，绞车架子直径九十至一百厘米。顺坡铺设双行木轨道，以四轮滑车沿轨道绞动上下运输。滑车后轮直径应大于前轮一倍，以调整受载重心。共六人操作。四人在坡上绞应二人在坡下装土。每天以十小时计算，可运三十至五十次，每人合一点四方土。
                      木轨斗车
    形式如轻便铁道斗车，轨都用木制。轨面应加钉铁皮竹片等，以减少摩擦阻力。交叉处铺设岔道。车斗有方盒斗、转盘斗、柜式斗、飞形斗等多种，以方盒斗简易好用。一至二人推车。在装卸土的地方，另装上土台、卸土滑板等工具。这种水轨斗车平地或小坡地都可适用。每车载重八百至一千二百斤。每人一天工效比肩挑提高五至八倍。
