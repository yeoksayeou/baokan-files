    Pit Bottom Commune Fully Utilizes the Experiences of the Great Leap Forward
    Experimental Plots Drive Overall Bumper Harvest of Late Rice

    (Our newspaper, Fuzhou, 17th dispatch) The Pit Bottom Commune in the eastern mountainous area of Shouning County, Fujian, this year had more than 350 cadres at all levels, together with veteran farmers and commune members, jointly cultivate 1,500 mu of command experimental plots and pacesetter experimental plots. This drove the commune's 5,570 mu of single-season late rice to achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest: total output increased by 34.45% compared to last year, with an average yield of 632 jin per mu, an increase of 31.7% compared to last year. Among them, the average yield of 350 mu of command plots was 1,115 jin per mu, a double increase compared to last year; the average yield of 1,150 mu of pacesetter plots was 832 jin per mu, an increase of 43% compared to last year.

    The Pit Bottom Commune is a poor mountainous area in Shouning County, with poor production conditions. In the early days after liberation, the grain yield per mu was only over 200 jin. Last year, cadres cultivated a portion of experimental plots and initially gained experience in achieving high yields in mountainous areas. This year, when the decision was made to vigorously develop experimental plots, it was opposed by some people with conservative ideas. They said, "Even if you have the ability to turn a mouse into a water buffalo, you can't make mountainous fields produce high yields." Others said, "The soil layer in Pit Bottom is thin, and no matter how much you experiment, you won't reach 1,000 jin." Still others said, "We have more land than people in the mountainous areas. If we all put so much effort into farming, where will the labor force come from?" In response to these arguments, the commune Party committee launched a commune-wide debate to defend the experimental plots, and the broad masses of commune members and cadres criticized the above erroneous arguments with concrete facts and reasoning.

    The mass debate defended the reputation of the experimental plots and boosted the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses to vigorously develop experimental plots. The commune Party committee conscientiously summarized the experience of last year's experimental plots, absorbed the correct opinions of the masses on the experimental plots, and adopted the following three measures: ① Mobilize all cadres, veteran farmers, and commune members to jointly cultivate the experimental plots. ② Conduct experimental plots on good fields, bad fields, and ordinary fields. ③ The experimental plots are divided into two types: one is the command plot, which becomes the base point for the commune Party committee, the brigade Party branch, and the production team leader to organize agricultural production leap forward; the other is the pacesetter plot, which is distributed in every section and corner, and becomes the pacesetter for cadres at all levels to take the lead in implementing the Party committee's call and promoting advanced experience. More than 350 cadres in the commune linked up with more than 2,500 veteran farmers and commune members, and selected 1,500 mu of various types of fields as single-season late rice experimental plots (accounting for 26.8% of the total area of single-season late rice in the commune), basically achieving that every cadre cultivates experimental plots, every team has command plots, and every section has pacesetter plots. After the commune Party committee established this series of experimental plots, it implemented the leadership method of "one point leading one line, one field leading one area." From the formulation of production targets to the adoption of yield-increasing measures, the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" was comprehensively implemented, and advanced experiences were promoted by first implementing them in the command plots. Then, on-site meetings were held, with the pacesetter plots taking the lead in setting an example, driving the comprehensive promotion of ordinary fields in the surrounding area. For example, the local masses did not have the habit of collecting green leaves as base fertilizer in the past. This year, the cadres first set an example in the command plots and held an on-site meeting to promote this experience. Then, the pacesetter plots in each section took the lead in applying 56 dan of green fertilizer per mu as base fertilizer, thereby driving the commune-wide upsurge of two green manure harvesting movements. For example, during the rice transplanting season, the experimental plots generally changed from transplanting five days before "Mangzhong" in previous years to transplanting five days before "Xiaoman," and promoted rational close planting, so that more than 5,000 mu of late rice in the commune were generally transplanted ten days earlier than last year, and the planting density was generally reduced by two or three inches compared to last year. Veteran farmer Wu Yuli of Banlingyang has always adhered to the theory of "sparse fields and dense grains," advocating that the transplanting specifications should be one chi to one chi and two cun. However, when he saw that the dense planting experimental plot of the Party branch secretary grew very well and the yield was high, he no longer insisted on his own opinion. During the field management period, the experimental plots of Haoxi Brigade adopted the method of eating small meals frequently and diligently applying topdressing fertilizer according to the growth needs of the rice, continuously eliminating third-class seedlings, improving first-class seedlings, and driving second-class seedlings, so that the rice grew very well. The commune Party committee held an on-site meeting next to the experimental plots of this team. As a result, the late rice in the entire commune achieved three times of inter-tillage and topdressing.

    This year, the Pit Bottom Commune insisted on the leadership method of experimental plots driving ordinary fields and vigorously carried out mass movements. It not only achieved brilliant achievements in production, but also enabled the broad masses of cadres to learn more agricultural production knowledge, continuously improve their work style, and closely connect with the masses. Cadres at all levels in the commune prepared their own agricultural tools and farmed the land together with the masses. Among them, more than 280 cadres at the team level generally achieved going out, returning, and laboring together with the commune members; 58 out of 65 commune and brigade cadres participated in labor for more than 20 days per month.

### 坑底公社充分运用大跃进的经验  试验田带动晚稻全面丰产

    坑底公社充分运用大跃进的经验
    试验田带动晚稻全面丰产
    本报福州17日电　福建东部山区寿宁县坑底公社，今年全社各级干部三百五十多人和老农、社员共同种植了一千五百亩指挥试验田和标兵试验田，带动了全社五千五百七十亩单季晚稻获得空前大丰收：总产量比去年增加34.45％，平均亩产六百三十二斤，比去年增产31.7％。其中有三百五十亩指挥田平均亩产一千一百十五斤，比去年增产一倍；一千一百五十亩标兵田平均亩产八百三十二斤，比去年增产43％。
    坑底公社是寿宁县的贫瘠山区，生产条件较差，解放初期粮食亩产只有二百多斤。去年干部种了一部分试验田，初步取得了山区丰产的经验；今年决定大搞试验田的时候，却遭到一些有保守思想的人的反对。他们说：“你有老鼠变水牛的本领也不能叫山田高产。”也有的说：“坑底土层薄，再试验也达不到千斤。”又有一些人说：“我们山区地多人少，如果都用这么大工夫种田，哪里来的劳力？”公社党委针对这些论调，发动全社开展了一场保卫试验田的大辩论，广大社员和干部以具体事实和道理批驳了以上各种误错言论。
    群众大辩论，保卫了试验田的声誉，鼓起了干部和群众大搞试验田的干劲。公社党委认真总结了去年试验田的经验，吸取群众对试验田的正确意见，采取了下列三项措施：①动员全体干部和老农、社员共同来种试验田。②不论好田、坏田、一般田都搞试验田。③试验田分为两种：一种指挥田，成为公社党委、大队党支部和生产队长组织农业生产跃进的基点；另一种是标兵田，分布在每一地段角落，成为各级干部带头贯彻党委号召和推行先进经验的标兵。全社三百五十多个干部，分别串连了二千五百多个老农和社员，选择了各种各样的田地一千五百亩作为单季晚稻试验田（占全社单季晚稻总面积的26.8％），基本上作到干部人人种试验田，队队都有指挥田，片片段段都有标兵田。公社党委建立这一系列的试验田后，就实行“一点牵一线、一田带一片”的领导方法，从制订生产指标到采取增产措施，全面贯彻农业八字宪法，推广先进经验都由指挥田先搞；再召开现场会，由标兵田带头作出榜样，带动周围一般田全面推广。如当地群众过去没有采青叶作基肥的习惯，今年干部先在指挥田作出榜样，召开现场会推广这一经验，然后各片各段的标兵田带头，每亩施用五十六担青肥作基肥，从而带动了全社掀起了两次采割绿肥运动。又如在插秧季节，试验田普遍从往年“芒种”前五天插秧改为“小满”前五天插秧，并推行合理密植，使全社五千多亩晚稻普遍比去年提早十天插好秧，种植密度普遍比去年缩小两三寸。半岭洋老农吴玉礼向来坚持“稀田密谷”论调，主张插秧规格是一尺至一尺二寸，但是当他看到党支部书记的密植试验田秧苗长得很好，产量高，他就不再坚持自己的意见了。在田间管理期间，浩溪大队的试验田按照稻子生长需要，采用少吃多餐、勤施追肥，不断消灭三类苗、提高一类苗、带动二类苗的办法，使稻子长得很好。公社党委就在这个队的试验田边召开现场会，结果全社晚稻都作到了中耕追肥三次。
    坑底公社今年坚持试验田带动一般田的领导方法，大搞群众运动，不仅在生产上取得了辉煌的成就，而且使广大干部学习到更多的农业生产知识，不断改进工作作风，密切了群众关系。全社各级干部人人都自备农具，和群众一道种田。其中小队一级干部二百八十多人，普遍做到和社员同出、同归、同劳动；公社、大队干部六十五人有五十八人每月参加劳动在二十天以上。
