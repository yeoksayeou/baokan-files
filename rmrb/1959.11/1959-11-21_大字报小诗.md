    Little Poems from Big-Character Posters
    I

    It is the bourgeois stand,
    Rooting for the rich middle peasants,
    Singing in chorus with the imperialists,
    Body in Cao Ying, heart in Han,
    Spearhead pointing at the Party!
    Right-leaning opportunist elements,
    Their crimes are evident!

    II

    He picks at minor flaws,
    Finds fault where there are none,
    Negates everything at the drop of a hat,
    And does so with glee!
    The medical history of right-leaning
    —Always the same.

    III

    The wind blows this way,
    The waist sways this way;
    The grass moves that way,
    The legs bend that way.
    One "ism" commands
    —Right-leaning opportunism.

    IV

    How small his vision!
    How little his knowledge!
    Yet he claims to be unique!
    This won't do,
    That's no good either…
    He is a megalomaniac,
    Unaware of the immensity of earth and heaven;
    It is class instinct at work,
    Quickly reform!

    V

    Unused, it rusts,
    Unwashed, it gets dirty,
    Unfired, it cannot become iron,
    Unrefined, how can it become steel?
    If there are mistakes, correct them,
    Pay your debts to the people.
    Fall down, get up,
    Turning back, there is—the Party!

    VI

    From that shore to this shore,
    Burn the boat that brought you!
    Throw yourself into the collective without reservation,
    A broad mind makes for a wide world.

    VII

    Sees deeply,
    Thinks broadly,
    Sharp as lightning,
    Warm as the spring sun,
    Firm as a rock,
    Wisdom like the ocean,
    Worried about the working masses,
    Thinking of future generations,
    Oh, great soul,
    He is the Party! Yuan Shuipai poem, Hua Junwu drawing (with picture)

    大字报小诗
    一
    是资产阶级立场，
    为富裕中农帮腔，
    和帝国主义者合唱，
    身在曹营心在汉，
    矛头指向党！
    右倾机会主义分子
    罪恶昭彰！
    二
    小毛病他挑，
    没毛病他剔，
    动不动否定一切，
    还要兴高采烈！
    右倾的病历
    ——千篇一律。
    三
    风往这边吹，
    腰往这边摆；
    草往那边动，
    腿往那边弯。
    一个“主义”指挥
    ——右倾机会。
    四
    所见何其小！
    所知何其少！
    偏偏自命独到！
    这个也不行，
    那个也不好……
    是自大狂者，
    不知地厚天高；
    是阶级本能作怪，
    赶快改造！
    五
    不磨生锈，
    不洗要脏，
    不烧不成铁，
    不炼怎成钢？
    有错就改，
    向人民还账。
    跌倒了，爬起来，
    回头是——党！
    六
    从那岸渡到这岸，
    烧掉来时船！
    投进集体无保留，
    心广天地宽。
    七看得深，
    想得广，
    锐利如电，
    和煦如春阳，
    坚定如磐石，
    智慧比海洋，
    为劳动群众操心，
    为子孙万代着想，
    伟大的心灵啊，
    他是党！	袁水拍诗　华君武画（附图片）
