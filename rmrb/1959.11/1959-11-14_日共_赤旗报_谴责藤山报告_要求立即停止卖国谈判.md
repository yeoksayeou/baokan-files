Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 13th: The "Akahata" published an editorial today condemning Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama's report on revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The editorial pointed out that Fujiyama's report to the Diet on the 10th and 11th was full of deception. It did not answer questions the Japanese people wanted to know, such as the content of the negotiations on the new treaty, the true political intentions of the new treaty, and its impact on the future.

The editorial pointed out that revising the "Security Treaty" not only runs counter to the trend of easing world tensions, but also shows that the Kishi Nobusuke government is colluding with U.S. warmongers in an attempt to prevent the easing of tensions.

"Akahata" pointed out that revising the "Security Treaty" violates the Japanese Constitution and the Japanese people's desire for peace.

The editorial pointed out that due to the revision of the "Security Treaty," Japan will be tightly bound to the U.S. war chariot and will be further subordinate to the United States, placing it in a position of hostility towards the Soviet Union and China.

"Akahata" demanded that the Japanese government disclose all the details of the negotiations to revise the "Security Treaty" and immediately halt these treacherous and criminal negotiations.

"Akahata" called for further expansion of the united front of all democratic forces, with the working class as its core, to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," and to launch a powerful struggle centered on workers' strikes to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

"Akahata" emphasized that as long as people from all walks of life unite and launch a struggle, they will surely achieve final victory.

    日共“赤旗报”谴责藤山报告
    要求立即停止卖国谈判
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”今天发表社论，谴责外务相藤山爱一郎关于修改日美“安全条约”的报告。
    社论指出，藤山10日和11日在国会所作的报告充满着欺骗。它对日本人民想知道的事情，如关于新条约的谈判的内容、新条约的真正的政治意图和对将来的影响等问题都没有作出答复。
    社论指出，修改“安全条约”不仅同趋向缓和的世界潮流背道而驰，而且表明岸信介政府同美国好战分子勾结企图阻止紧张局势的缓和。
    “赤旗报”指出，修改“安全条约”是违反日本宪法和日本人民渴望和平的愿望的。
    社论指出，由于修改“安全条约”，日本将被紧紧地束缚在美国的战车上，并且使日本进一步从属于美国，处于同苏联和中国为敌的地位。
    “赤旗报”要求日本政府公开修改“安全条约”谈判的全部内容，并且立即停止这种卖国和犯罪的谈判。
    “赤旗报”号召进一步扩大以工人阶级为核心的全体民主力量阻止修改“安全条约”的战线，展开以工人阶级的罢工为中心的强有力的斗争，来阻止修改并争取废除日美“安全条约”。
    “赤旗报”强调指出，只要各阶层人民团结一致展开斗争，必定能够获得最后胜利。
