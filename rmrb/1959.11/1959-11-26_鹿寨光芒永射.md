    The Eternal Radiance of Luzhai
    Wang Pu
    During the Great Leap Forward last year, Luzhai County in Guangxi, famous for its large-scale steel production, saw the emergence of a small steel plant. Like hundreds of other small steel plants across the country, the Luzhai branch of the Liuzhou Steel Plant was a product of the mass steel-making movement. Fourteen months ago, when peasants of various ethnic groups from Luzhai, Liujiang, Rong'an, Da Miao Shan, and Shilong counties came to the verdant banks of the Luoqing River with picks, carrying poles, axes, and broadswords, it was still a wilderness overgrown with weeds. Now, a small "steel city" has risen from the ground, with small blast furnaces equipped with some modern technology gushing molten iron, trains and cars running in the valleys, and rows of houses at the foot of the mountains. The pig iron produced by this new city will, when all blast furnaces are in production, meet more than 70% of the casting iron needs of the mechanical industry in the entire Guangxi region. What a tremendous change has taken place in the natural landscape there!
    Last year it was "small-scale indigenous groups," now it is "small-scale foreign groups." Not only is the Luzhai branch different from last year, but hundreds of other small steel plants across the country are also different from last year. Were there any shortcomings in Luzhai's large-scale steel production last year? Yes, the quality qualification rate was not very high, and the cost was relatively high. However, last year there were only earthen furnaces, no coke, no crushers for crushing ore, and both workers and cadres were inexperienced. What is so surprising about the emergence of such shortcomings? These shortcomings are entirely temporary phenomena. With the change of technical conditions and the growth of workers and cadres, aren't these shortcomings being rapidly overcome? Isn't it true that low output has turned into high output, low quality has turned into high quality, and high cost has turned into low cost?
    Some people say, "If we have today, why did we do it that way in the first place?" They believe that the transformation from "small-scale indigenous groups" to "small-scale foreign groups" means that the "small-scale indigenous groups" were wrong. We say that the transformation from "small-scale indigenous groups" to "small-scale foreign groups" is the result of the development of things from a lower level to a higher level. "Small-scale indigenous groups" are a great creation of the people in our country's socialist construction. Last year's "small-scale indigenous groups" lifted the veil of "mystery" from industrial production, and tens of millions of people went to the mountains and found iron and coal in places that were previously thought to have no iron and no coal, creating conditions for the "fixed-point" of "small-scale foreign groups." The "small-scale indigenous groups" trained talent for the "small-scale foreign groups." The vast majority of cadres who now manage small steel plants and the vast majority of workers who master foreign technology were trained in the practice of last year's "small-scale indigenous groups." The "small-scale indigenous groups" also prepared material and technical conditions for the "small-scale foreign groups." Taking the Luzhai branch as an example, the iron smelted in earthen blast furnaces last year was transported to Shanghai, smelted into steel, and then turned into the complete set of technical equipment for the "small-scale foreign groups." Luzhai took this path of development, and so did many other places that were originally without iron and steel. Therefore, without the "indigenous" of last year, there would not be the "foreign" of today. When drinking water, remember the source. It is not a matter of "If we have today, why did we do it that way in the first place," but rather "The reason we have today is because of what we did in the beginning."
    Last year's Great Leap Forward was a great creation of the people of the whole country. Last year's large-scale steel production in Luzhai declared the end of Guangxi's history of not being able to produce steel, accelerated the process of industrial development in Guangxi, and added glory to Guangxi. The people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi will always be proud of the spirit of daring to think and daring to act and the great achievements made in last year's large-scale steel production, and the people of the whole country will always be proud of the spirit of daring to think and daring to act and the great achievements made in last year's large-scale steel production. The radiance of Luzhai will shine forever, and the radiance of the mass movement will shine forever. In the future, we will continue to carry forward the fearless spirit of daring to think and daring to act, and, according to the situation and in accordance with local conditions, vigorously develop small-scale indigenous groups, small-scale foreign groups, medium-scale foreign groups, and large-scale foreign groups in all walks of life, and work together to move forward. The wheel of our country's socialist construction can then continue to move forward at a high speed!

    鹿寨光芒永射
    王朴
    去年大跃进中以大办钢铁著名的广西鹿寨县出现了一个小型的钢铁厂。像遍布全国的几百个小型钢铁厂一样，柳州钢铁厂鹿寨分厂是全民大办钢铁的产儿。十四个月以前，当鹿寨、柳江、融安、大苗山和石龙等县各族农民，带着镐头、扁担、斧子、大刀来到峰峦叠翠的洛清河畔的时候，那里仍然是杂草丛生的荒野。现在呢，一座小型的“钢铁新城”平地起，有了一定现代技术装备的小高炉奔流着铁水，火车、汽车在山谷里奔跑，山脚下房屋成排。这座新城生产的生铁，在全部高炉投入生产后，将满足广西全区70％以上机械工业铸造用铁的需要。在那里，自然面貌起了多么大的变化啊！
    去年是“小土群”，现在是“小洋群”。不但是鹿寨分厂跟去年不一个样儿，全国其他几百个小型钢铁厂也都跟去年的不一个样儿了。去年鹿寨大办钢铁有没有缺点呢？有的，质量合格率不太高，成本比较高。然而去年不仅是土炉子，没有焦炭、没有粉碎机碎矿石，而且工人和干部都是生手，产生这样或那样的缺点，有什么可奇怪的呢？这些缺点完全是一种暂时的现象。随着技术条件的改变，随着工人和干部的成长，这些缺点不是正在迅速克服吗？现在不是低产变成了高产、低质变成了优质、高成本变成了低成本吗？
    有人说：“既有今日，何必当初？”认为“小土群”变为“小洋群”，就是“小土群”搞错了。我们说，“小土群”变为“小洋群”，是事物从低级向高级发展的结果。“小土群”是我国社会主义建设中人民的伟大创造。去年的“小土群”，揭开了人们对办工业的“神秘”的帷幕，几千万人上山，在过去被认为没有铁、没有煤的地方，找到了铁和煤，给“小洋群”的“定点”创造了条件。“小土群”给“小洋群”造就了人才。现在管理小型钢铁厂的绝大部分干部，掌握洋技术的绝大部分工人，都是在去年“小土群”的实践中锻炼出来的。“小土群”还给“小洋群”准备了物质技术条件。拿鹿寨分厂来讲，去年用土高炉炼出来的铁，运到上海炼成钢，变成材，然后才变成“小洋群”的整套技术装备的。鹿寨走这条发展的道路，其他许多原来手无寸铁的地方，也莫不是从这条道路走过来的。所以，没有去年的“土”，就不会迅速有今年的“洋”。饮水思源，根本不是什么“既有今日，何必当初”，而是“所以有今日，只因有当初。”
    去年的大跃进是全国人民的伟大创造。去年鹿寨大办钢铁，宣告了广西不能炼钢铁的历史的结束，加速了广西工业发展的进程，为广西增加了光荣。广西各族人民永远为去年大办钢铁中所表现的敢想敢干精神和所取得的伟大成就而感到自豪，全国人民也永远为去年大办钢铁中所表现的敢想敢干精神和所取得的伟大成就而感到自豪。鹿寨的光芒永射，群众运动的光芒永射。我们今后将继续发扬敢想敢干的大无畏精神，根据情况，因地制宜大办各行各业的小土群、小洋群、中洋群、大洋群，协力前进，我国社会主义建设的车轮就可以不断地高速度前进了！
