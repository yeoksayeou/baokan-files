    "Walking on Two Legs" Achieves High Speed
    Striding Across 1959 with Heroic Steps
    Yunnan: Fulfills Annual Copper Production Plan Ahead of Schedule and Exceeds Target
    Heilongjiang: Timber and Pig Iron Both Exceed Annual Targets
    Fujian: Achieves Annual Light Industry Total Output Value Target
    Inner Mongolia: This Year's Salt Production of One Million Tons Task Already Exceeded

    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, November 6th: Yunnan Province's copper smelting industry, by implementing the "walking on two legs" approach and launching a vigorous mass movement, has fulfilled the state's annual copper production plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target.
    As of November 5th, the province's production of blister copper exceeded the annual plan by 7.99%, and electrolytic copper exceeded the annual plan by 43.8%; the quality has also been greatly improved, with the copper content of blister copper reaching over 80%, exceeding the national standard. The electrolytic copper produced in August and September both reached the standard for extra-grade copper; production costs have also been reduced.
    Last year, while vigorously developing steel smelting, various parts of the province launched a mass copper smelting movement, with more than 120 major copper smelting points, rapidly opening up the province's copper smelting industry.
    This year, the Yunnan Metallurgical Industry Department continued to implement the Party's "walking on two legs" approach, actively building large and medium-sized copper mines on the one hand, and improving and developing mass-based indigenous copper smelting industry on the other. Generally, indigenous machinery was used to replace manual mining and ore dressing, and some blowers and power equipment were equipped, so that indigenous copper smelting gradually transitioned to "semi-indigenous, semi-foreign" and "indigenous-foreign combination." On this basis, various measures were taken to accelerate the construction of "small foreign groups." As a result, the province's copper production this year has increased significantly compared to last year, while the labor input has been greatly reduced.

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin: The forestry workers of Heilongjiang Province, who are responsible for one-third of the country's timber production, completed the annual timber production plan sixty-three days ahead of schedule, exceeding the target by 7,958 cubic meters. Timber production increased by 49.4% compared to the same period in 1958; timber production costs decreased by 1.89% compared to the plan; the forest renewal plan was completed by 103%, and forest chemical products exceeded the plan by 34.2%.
    The 300,000 forestry workers fighting in the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains and the Wanda Mountains launched an increase production and practice economy campaign this year, with quality, high yield, low consumption, and safety as the center. Workers carried out technical innovations, and according to incomplete statistics, more than 150,000 rationalization proposals were put forward in the province, of which more than 80,000 have been adopted. The thirty-one sets of timber collection and transportation tools that have been summarized and finalized in the province have been widely promoted and used, increasing the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of production from 30% at the beginning of the year to 60%.

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin: Heilongjiang Province exceeded the annual pig iron production plan by sixty-two tons on October 29th, completing it ahead of schedule. The province's pig iron production this year has increased by 1.7 times compared to the total output last year, pig iron costs have been reduced by 63% compared to last year, and the qualified rate of pig iron has reached 94%.

    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 8th: Fujian Province's light industrial production has completed the annual total output value plan fifty-eight days ahead of schedule, with the total output value increasing by 11% compared to the whole of last year. Among the twenty-five major light industrial products, eleven, including cotton cloth, soap, spices, leather, enamel basins, rickshaw tires, dry batteries, and cod liver oil, have exceeded the state's annual plan, with output increasing by 20% to 2.5 times compared to the same period last year; fourteen products, including sugar, machine-made paper, salt, cigarettes, matches, canned goods, and rubber shoes, have also increased by 10% to four times compared to the same period last year. The quality of light industrial products has significantly improved.
    Due to the implementation of the "walking on two legs" approach of combining large, medium, and small enterprises and combining indigenous and foreign methods, a large number of newly built and expanded light industrial factories in Fujian Province have been put into production this year. The province's total investment in light industrial capital construction this year is 39% more than in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, with 144 projects under construction, of which 42 have already been put into production. People's communes have also established a large number of light industrial factories, becoming a vital force in the province's light industrial production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, November 10th: To date, Inner Mongolia has completed this year's production task of one million tons of salt ahead of schedule and exceeded the target; the production plans for more than ten kinds of chemical raw material products, such as anhydrous sodium sulfate, potassium chloride, and halite, using brine from salt lakes in various places, have also been completed at the same time, of which the output of anhydrous sodium sulfate has increased by seven times compared to the actual output last year.
    After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the enthusiasm of salt workers in various places became even higher. They overcame the difficulties brought about by heavy rains and floods washing away salt ponds, and their output not only did not decrease but also increased steadily. The daily output of crude salt in the whole region in early September increased by 21% compared with late August, the middle ten days increased by 11% compared with the early ten days, and the last ten days increased sharply by 60% compared with the middle ten days, and all the crude salt produced was first-class salt with a sodium chloride content of more than 97.5%.

    “两条腿走路”出现高速度
    迈开英雄步伐跨过一九五九年
    云南：提前超额完成全年产铜计划
    黑龙江：木材生铁双双超过全年任务
    福建：实现全年轻工业总产值指标
    内蒙古：今年产盐百万吨任务已超额
    据新华社昆明6日电　云南省炼铜工业贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针和大搞群众运动，提前超额完成了今年的国家产铜计划。
    到11月5日止，全省生产的粗铜超额7.99％、电解铜超额43.8％完成了年计划；质量也大大提高，粗铜的含铜率达到80％以上，超过国家标准。8、9月份生产的电解铜都达到了特号铜的标准；生产成本也有降低。
    去年全省各地在大炼钢铁的同时，开展了群众性的炼铜运动，主要炼铜点达到一百二十多个，迅速打开了全省炼铜工业的局面。
    今年，云南冶金工业部门继续贯彻了党的“两条腿走路”的方针，一方面积极建设大、中型铜矿，一方面对群众性的土法炼铜工业加以提高和发展，一般都采用了土机械代替手工采矿、选矿，装备了一些鼓风机和动力设备，使土法炼铜逐步过渡到“半土半洋”和“土洋结合”。在这一基础上，又采取各种措施，加快“小洋群”的建设。结果，今年全省的铜产量比去年增加很多，而投入的劳动力却比去年大大减少。
    据新华社哈尔滨电　担负全国三分之一木材生产任务的黑龙江省林业职工提前六十三天超额七千九百五十八立方米完成了全年木材生产计划，木材产量比1958年同期增长49.4％；木材生产成本比计划降低1.89％；森林更新计划完成103％，林产化学产品超额34.2％完成了计划。
    战斗在大小兴安岭和完达山一带的三十万林业职工，今年开展了以优质、高产、低耗、安全为中心的增产节约竞赛运动，职工大搞技术革新，据不完全统计，全省共提出合理化建议十五万多件，其中有八万多件已被采纳。全省目前经过总结定型的三十一种成套集运木材工具，都已广泛推广使用，使生产机械化、半机械化的程度由年初的30％提高到60％。
    据新华社哈尔滨电　黑龙江省在10月29日超额六十二吨提前完成了全年生铁生产计划。全省今年已经生产的生铁，比去年全年产量增长一点七倍，生铁成本比去年降低63％，生铁合格率达到94％。
    据新华社福州8日电　福建省轻工业生产已经提前五十八天完成全年总产值计划，总产值比去年全年增长11％。二十五种主要轻工业产品中，棉布、肥皂、香料、皮革、搪瓷面盆、人力车外胎、干电池、鱼肝油等十一种已经超额完成国家年度计划，分别比去年同期产量增长20％到两倍半；糖、机制纸、盐、卷烟、火柴、罐头、胶鞋等十四种产品也比去年同期增长10％到四倍不等。轻工业产品质量有显著提高。
    由于贯彻大中小并举与土洋并举的两条腿走路方针，今年福建省有大批新建、扩建的轻工业工厂投入生产。全省今年轻工业基本建设投资总额比大跃进的1958年还多39％，动工建设的项目达一百四十四项，其中有四十二项已经投入生产。人民公社也兴办了大批轻工业工厂，成为全省轻工业生产中的一支生力军。
    据新华社呼和浩特10日电　到目前为止，内蒙古已提前超额完成了今年产盐一百万吨的生产任务；利用各地盐湖中的卤水生产无水芒硝、氯化钾、卤块等十多种化工原料产品的生产计划，也同时完成了，其中无水芒硝的产量比去年实际产量提高了七倍。
    党的八届八中全会以后，各地盐场职工干劲更加高昂。他们克服了由于暴雨和洪水冲刷盐池所带来的困难，产量不但没有下降，反而节节上升。全区9月上旬的原盐日产量比8月下旬提高21％，中旬比上旬提高11％，下旬又比中旬猛增60％，而且所产的原盐全部是含氯化钠97.5％以上的特级盐。
