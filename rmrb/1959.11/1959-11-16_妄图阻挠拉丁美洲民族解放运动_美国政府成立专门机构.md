Xinhua News Agency, November 15th, Washington dispatch: As the national democratic movement in Latin America is rising day by day, US President Eisenhower formally approved the establishment of a so-called "National Advisory Committee on Latin American Affairs" on the 14th, in order to try to "improve relations between Latin America and the United States."

This committee was hastily announced three days after US Secretary of State Herter held a press conference in Washington on the 12th. At that press conference, Herter made it clear that the United States "is very concerned and somewhat uneasy about any growing anti-American sentiment that may be occurring in (Latin America)."

The aforementioned committee was established on the recommendation of Milton Eisenhower, a personal advisor to the US President. Herter has been appointed as the chairman of the committee.

    妄图阻挠拉丁美洲民族解放运动
    美国政府成立专门机构
    新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：由于拉丁美洲民族民主运动日趋高涨，美国总统艾森豪威尔14日正式批准成立一个所谓“拉丁美洲事务国家顾问委员会”来设法“改进拉丁美洲和美国的关系”。
    这个委员会是在美国国务卿赫脱12日在华盛顿举行记者招待会后三天匆匆宣告成立的。赫脱在那次记者招待会上曾明白表示，美国“对于可能在（拉丁美洲）发生的任何日益增长的反美情绪非常注意，并且感到有些不安。”
    上述委员会是根据美国总统私人顾问密尔顿·艾森豪威尔的建议设立的。赫脱已经被任命为委员会的主席。
