(Xinhua News Agency, October 31st) Xu Xuehui, a teller at the Longchuan Farm Branch of the People's Bank of Ruili County, Yunnan Province, today addressed the National Conference of Heroes, with a speech titled "Forever Be a Loyal Daughter of the Party," recounting her moving story of bravely protecting national property and having her hands cut off by bandits. When this eighteen-year-old heroine, bearing the glorious scars, stepped onto the "Conference of Heroes" platform, the representatives immediately expressed their admiration with enthusiastic applause.

Xu Xuehui said, "I am a bank teller working at the Longchuan Farm Branch of the People's Bank of Ruili County in Yunnan Province, on the southwestern border of our country. Our branch is located on a small hilltop, only a two-hour walk from the Sino-Burmese border, flanked by a civil trade store and a grain management office, with no residences nearby. On the morning of March 3rd this year, at four o'clock, six Kuomintang remnant bandits who had fled to Burma illegally crossed the border to rob our branch. The sound of the bandits pushing open the bamboo door woke me from my dream. Six bandits swarmed in and surrounded me. At that time, I had only one thought: the 50,000 yuan in the cash box was national property, and I would rather die than let the bandits steal it. So I shouted, 'Comrades, come quickly and catch the bandits!' Seeing this, the head bandit urged the other bandits to quickly search for the money, while threatening me, 'Don't shout, or I'll kill you!' Disregarding his threats, I continued to shout loudly. Seeing that threats and intimidation were not working, one of the bandits raised a long knife and slashed at my mouth. I only felt a buzzing in my head and fell to the ground. When I quickly got up, the bandits had already found the cash box and were preparing to carry it away. I lunged forward to grab the cash box, struggling and shouting. Several bandits rushed up, pinching my throat, blocking my mouth, and twisting my hands behind my back. I immediately broke free from their grasp on my neck, threw myself on the cash box, and held it tightly, shouting even louder. The inhuman bandits, seeing that they could not subdue me, raised their long knives and slashed at my hands. Instantly, it felt like a thousand-pound hammer hitting my heart, and I fainted again. Taking advantage of my unconsciousness, the evil bandits slashed me six more times on my back, chest, and legs."

"When I woke up, everything was quiet. I strained to open my eyes. The cash box was gone, and I could only vaguely hear the sound of footsteps fading away. Anxious, I mustered all my strength and struggled to shout, 'Come quickly! The bandits have robbed the cash box!'"

Xu Xuehui continued: "The bandits ultimately did not steal the cash box. Although they knocked me unconscious once or twice, I fell down and got up again to fight and shout, finally waking Comrade Wang Tianlin of the nearby farm trading company. He arrived with a gun and shot and killed the bandit squad leader Li Xinhong, who was carrying the cash box and fleeing, on the spot, and recovered the cash box."

"When the local people learned that the remnant bandits had robbed the bank and cut off my hands, they were filled with indignation. They actively assisted the public security organs in pursuing the bandits, and finally captured Yang Wenzhong, the bandit who had cut off my hands. This heinous counter-revolutionary has already been executed on the spot at a public trial attended by more than 5,000 people in Ruili County. The Party and the people have avenged my blood feud."

Xu Xuehui said, "The fact that I can do this little thing for the Party and the people is entirely the result of the Party's constant education and cultivation. Before 1956, when I was still in elementary school, the Party taught me to love the motherland, love the people, love labor, cherish public property, and be a heroic fighter like Liu Hulan, Zhao Yiman, and Zoya. When I graduated from elementary school in 1956 and joined the bank with great enthusiasm, I was still a fifteen-year-old child wearing a red scarf, and I didn't understand many things. But the Party patiently educated me, and my comrades gave me enthusiastic help, which gradually made me understand some revolutionary principles. This time, risking my life to protect national property was precisely a test for me. I believe that having the opportunity to contribute my two hands for the Party and the people is the greatest honor in my life."

Xu Xuehui said: "Only the Party cares most about people, especially our young people. After I was injured, the leaders of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee, the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee, the Ruili County Party Committee, and many units such as the People's Bank, gave me meticulous care, took various measures to save my life, sent a plane to take me to Kunming for treatment, and assigned the best doctors and used the most precious medicines. Many comrades rushed to donate blood to me, which helped me recover quickly. While I was still in the hospital, the responsible comrades of the province's Party, government, labor union, and youth league personally came to see me during their busy schedules, encouraged me, and taught me to learn from Wu Yunduo, learn from Paul Korchagin, and learn from the legless flying general Alexei. The leading organs of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Women's Federation, and the head office of the People's Bank also sent me special telegrams of encouragement. Many workers, soldiers, government officials, and young people sent me thousands of letters of condolence from all over the country, and comrades from fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union and Vietnam also sent me enthusiastic telegrams from distant Moscow and Hanoi. All of this made me deeply realize how warm and happy it is to live in the big family of the socialist motherland."

Xu Xuehui finally said excitedly: "Although I have lost my hands, I still have eyes, a mouth, two feet, and a strong body. I can still do many things that are beneficial to the people and beneficial to socialist construction. I am determined, under the leadership and education of the Party, to work with my comrades to overcome difficulties and contribute all my strength to accelerating the socialist construction of our country."

    群英会上徐学惠表示英雄决心
    永远做党的忠实女儿
    据新华社31日讯　云南省瑞丽县人民银行陇川农场营业所营业员徐学惠，今天以“永远做党的忠实女儿”为题在全国群英大会上介绍了她奋不顾身保卫国家财产，被匪徒砍掉双手的动人事迹。当这位十八岁的女英雄带着光荣的伤痕，登上“群英会”讲台的时候，代表们立刻以热烈的掌声来表达对她的钦佩。
    徐学惠说，我是一个银行营业员，在祖国西南边疆——云南省瑞丽县人民银行陇川农场营业所工作。我们营业所设在一个小山坡顶上，离中缅边界只有步行两小时的路程，两面是民贸商店和粮管所，没有人家居住。今年3月3日早晨四点钟，六个逃亡缅甸的国民党残匪偷越国境，来抢劫我们的营业所。匪徒拨动竹门的响声，把我从梦中惊醒。六个匪徒一窝蜂地跑进来，把我团团围住。当时，我只有一个想法：钱箱里的五万块钱，是国家的财产，死也不能让匪徒抢走。于是我大喊：“同志们快来抓土匪呀！”残匪头目见此情况，就一面催促匪徒赶快搜钱，一面威胁我说：“不许叫，再叫就杀死你！”我不顾他的威胁，仍然一股劲的大叫。匪徒们看到威胁、恐吓不成功，有个匪徒便举起长刀，照准我的嘴巴砍了下来。我只觉得脑子里嗡的一声响，便栽倒在地上。当我很快的爬起来时，匪徒们已经找到了钱箱，正准备扛着逃跑。我猛扑过去抱住钱箱，一面扭打，一面叫喊。几个匪徒一涌上来，七手八脚地卡住我的咽喉，堵住我的嘴，并把我的双手反扭过去。我一下子就挣脱了双手，拉开他们那些卡紧我的脖子的魔掌，扑在钱箱上抱住不放，并且又大叫大喊起来。没有人性的匪徒眼看制服不了我，便扬起长刀，向我的双手砍来，顿时，好像一个千斤重的铁锤打在我的心上，我又昏迷过去。趁我昏倒在地的时候，万恶的匪徒又在我的背上、胸上、腿上，连砍了六刀。
    当我醒过来的时候，周围静悄悄的。我用力睁开眼睛，钱箱已经不见了，只隐约地听到逐渐远去的脚步声。我心里一着急，又用尽力气挣扎着叫喊：“快来人呀！土匪把钱箱抢走了！”
    徐学惠接着说：匪徒到底没有把钱箱抢走。虽然他们把我一次两次地砍昏过去，但是，我倒下去又爬起来和他们扭打，喊叫，终于惊醒了附近农场贸易公司的王天林同志，他拿着枪赶来，把扛着钱箱正朝外逃的匪徒大队长李新红当场打死，把钱箱夺了回来。
    当地群众知道残匪抢劫了银行，砍断了我的双手以后，愤慨万分。他们积极协助公安机关追捕匪徒，终于把砍断我的双手的匪徒杨文忠抓住了。这个罪大恶极的反革命分子，已在瑞丽县五千多人的公审大会上，就地镇压。党和人民为我报了血海深仇。
    徐学惠说，我能为党、为人民做这一点小事情，完全是党对我不断教育和培养的结果。1956年以前，当我还在小学读书的时候，党就教导我要爱祖国，爱人民，爱劳动，爱护公共财物，要做一个像刘胡兰、赵一曼、卓娅那样的英勇战士。1956年小学毕业，怀着满腔热情参加银行工作时，我还是一个戴着红领巾的、十五岁的孩子，好多事都不懂。但是党对我进行了耐心的教育，同志们给了我热情的帮助，使我逐渐懂得了一些革命道理。我这次舍命保护国家财产，正是对我的一次考验。我认为我能有机会为党、为人民贡献出自己的两只手，是我一生中最大的光荣。
    徐学惠说：只有党才最关心人，最关心我们青年。我负伤后，中共云南省委、德宏傣族景颇族自治州委、瑞丽县委以及人民银行等许多单位的领导同志，都给了我无微不至的关怀，采取了各种措施来挽救我的生命，派飞机把我送到昆明治疗，还指派了最好的医生，使用了最贵重的药品。许多同志争先恐后地为我输血，使我很快就恢复了健康。当我还在医院里的时候，省的党、政、工、团负责同志，在百忙中亲自来看我，勉励我，教导我，教我要学习吴运铎，学习保尔·柯察金，学习无脚飞将军阿列克塞。共青团中央、全国妇联、人民银行总行等领导机关，还特地给我打来勉慰电报。许许多多工人、战士、机关干部、青少年们，从全国各地给我寄来了几千封慰问信，苏联、越南等兄弟国家的同志们，也从遥远的莫斯科和河内，打给我热情洋溢的电报。这一切，使我深深体会到，生活在社会主义祖国大家庭里，是多么的温暖和幸福。
    徐学惠最后激动地说：我虽然失去了双手，但我还有眼睛，还有嘴，还有两只脚和一个健壮的身体，我还可以做许多有益于人民、有益于社会主义建设的事情。我决心在党的领导和教育下，和同志们一道，战胜困难，为加速我国的社会主义建设，贡献出自己的全部力量。
