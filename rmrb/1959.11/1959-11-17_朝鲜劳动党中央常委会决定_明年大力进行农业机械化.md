    Kim Il-sung Speaks in South Hwanghae Province
    Korean Workers' Party Central Committee Standing Committee Decides
    To Vigorously Promote Agricultural Mechanization Next Year
    The basic content of the Korean agricultural technological revolution is: irrigation, mechanization, and electrification. Irrigation has been basically realized. The northern plains area will basically complete agricultural mechanization by 1961.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 16th: According to Pyongyang newspapers today, Korean Cabinet Premier Kim Il-sung said in a recent speech to cadres in South Hwanghae Province that the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party recently decided that when compiling next year's national economic plan, the focus should be on ensuring agricultural mechanization, and in particular, efforts should be concentrated on implementing agricultural mechanization in South Hwanghae Province and South Pyongan Province (the northern plains area of Korea), so that these two provinces can basically complete this task by 1961.
    Premier Kim Il-sung inspected various areas of South Hwanghae Province from the 12th to the 14th. He also said at the cadre meeting that the state will provide South Hwanghae Province with 1,000 tractors and a large number of automobiles next year. He called on all the people of South Hwanghae Province to launch a land leveling campaign starting this autumn to expand the area for mechanization.
    Premier Kim Il-sung said that in the near future, 80% to 85% of agricultural production labor in South Hwanghae Province can be mechanized, and the remaining 15% to 20% will rely on animal power to drive machinery. He called on the farmers of this province to strive to increase grain production to one million tons in the coming years.
    Premier Kim Il-sung said that the basic content of the Korean agricultural technological revolution is: irrigation, mechanization, and electrification. He said that due to concentrated efforts on irrigation, irrigation has now been basically realized. But mechanization has only just begun. He said that Korea's industry is now developing rapidly, and in order to make agriculture also develop rapidly and maintain a balance between industry and agriculture, agricultural mechanization must be widely implemented.
    In his speech, Premier Kim Il-sung also called on the directors of agricultural machinery rental stations to directly drive tractors, and responsible cadres of the provincial Party committees and provincial people's committees to directly participate in productive labor. He said that in this way, leading cadres can deeply understand the actual situation below and learn from the masses. He also emphasized that leading cadres should go deep into the masses to carry out their work, and that all work should be led by political work, so as to organize and mobilize the masses to achieve greater achievements.
    Premier Kim Il-sung also inspected the Haiju Agricultural Machinery Factory and other local industrial factories under construction in various parts of South Hwanghae Province, as well as agricultural cooperatives in Yan'an, Bicheng and other places, and gave specific instructions on the development of local industry and the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives.

    金日成在黄海南道讲话
    朝鲜劳动党中央常委会决定
    明年大力进行农业机械化
    朝鲜农业技术革命的基本内容是：水利化、机械化、电气化。水利化已基本上实现。北部平原地区在一九六一年将基本上完成农业机械化的工作。
    新华社平壤16日电　据平壤报纸今天报道，朝鲜内阁首相金日成最近在黄海南道的干部会上讲话时说，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会常务委员会最近决定，朝鲜在编制明年的人民经济计划时要以保证农业的机械化为中心，特别要在黄海南道和平安南道（朝鲜北部的平原地区）集中力量来实行农业机械化，以便使这两个道在1961年基本上完成这一工作。
    金日成首相从12日到14日在黄海南道各地进行了视察。他在干部会上又说，明年国家将给黄海南道一千台拖拉机和大量的汽车。他号召黄海南道全体人民从今年秋后起展开平整土地的运动，扩大机械化的面积。
    金日成首相说，不久的将来，黄海南道的农业生产劳动就有80％到85％可以机械化，剩下的15％到20％将依靠畜力来带动机械。他号召这个道农民为在近年内把粮食产量提高到一百万吨而努力。
    金日成首相说，朝鲜农业技术革命的基本内容是：水利化、机械化、电气化。他说，由于集中力量进行水利化的工作，现在已基本上实现了水利化。但是机械化还刚刚开始。他说，现在朝鲜的工业正在飞跃发展，为了使农业也随着迅速发展，使工业和农业保持平衡，就要广泛地实行农业机械化。
    金日成首相在讲话中还号召，农业机械代耕站的站长要直接开拖拉机，道党委会和道人民委员会的负责干部都要直接参加生产劳动。他说，这样，领导干部才能深入了解下面的实际情况，才能向群众学习。他还强调说，领导干部要深入到群众中去进行工作，一切工作要使政治工作先行，以组织和动员群众取得更大的成就。
    金日成首相在黄海南道各地还视察了正在修建中的海州农业机械工厂等地方工业工厂以及延安、碧城等地的农业合作社，并且就发展地方工业和农业社的经营管理作了具体指示。
