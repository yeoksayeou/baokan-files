Thoroughly Implement the Policy of Collective Breeding as Primary and Private Breeding as Supplementary
Launch a Winter High Tide of Pig Raising and Manure Accumulation

Raising pigs and accumulating manure is the primary source of farm manure. Pig manure and urine contain a large amount of organic matter, which is the best kind of farm manure. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are particularly needed by crops, are contained in 1.24 jin per 100 jin of pig manure and urine. Applying pig manure to crops has a significant effect on loosening the soil, strengthening the roots, promoting seedling growth, and strengthening the grains.

In recent years, China's pig raising industry has developed greatly. In 1949, there were a total of 57,752,000 pigs raised nationwide, an average of 3.9 pigs per 100 mu of cultivated land; by the end of 1958, this had developed to 160 million pigs, reaching 10 pigs per 100 mu of cultivated land. Currently, a winter high tide of pig raising is forming in various places.

    贯彻执行集体饲养为主私人饲养为辅的方针
    掀起冬季养猪积肥高潮
    养猪积肥是农家肥料的主要来源。猪粪尿含有大量有机物质，是一种最好的农家肥料。农作物所特别需要的氮、磷、钾，每百斤猪粪尿就含有一点二四斤。猪粪施于农作物，对于松土、培根、长苗架、壮籽实都有显著的作用。
    几年来，我国养猪事业有了很大发展。1949年全国共养猪五千七百七十五万二千头，平均每百亩耕地有猪三点九头；1958年底发展到一亿六千万头，每百亩耕地达十头。现在各地冬季养猪高潮正在形成。
