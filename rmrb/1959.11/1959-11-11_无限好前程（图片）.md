    Limitless Bright Future
    [Commemorative Stamps for the 10th Anniversary of the Founding of the Young Pioneers of China] Stars are twinkling, torches are shining, the Party leads the way, a limitless bright future. Bugle calls are so melodious, the morning breeze carries them in all directions, calling out to the Young Pioneers, welcoming the new era. Going to school early in the morning, the mood is so cheerful, smiling faces greet the sun, walking and singing. Setting great ambitions from a young age, diligently studying in spare time, learning good skills, mastering nature. Passionately loving labor, though small in stature, enthusiasm is high, turning the earth into a garden, we have made contributions. Not only studying well, but also being physically strong, a chorus of laughter, floats across the sports field.

    无限好前程
    〔中国少年先锋队  建队十周年纪念邮票〕星星亮晶晶，火炬放光明，党把方向引，无限好前程。号声多悠扬，晨风送四方，呼唤红领巾，迎接新时光。清早去学校，心情好舒畅，笑脸迎太阳，边走边歌唱。从小立大志，课余勤钻研，学得好本领，驾驭大自然。热情爱劳动，人小干劲高，大地园林化，我们有功劳。不仅学习好，还要身体强，一片欢笑声，飘过运动场。
