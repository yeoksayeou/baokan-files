The Iron Tree Blooms, the Heart Wants to Fly
    ——Remembering an Old Man's Words from the Xushui People's Commune Happiness Home
    Ji Peng

    The Qing, the Republic of China, the traitorous Wang and Chiang, which dynasty didn't have fat officials?
    They indulged in luxury in foreign-style buildings, while the people ate bran and vegetables, sleeping in the grass.
    In summer, they were naked, and in winter, they wore thin clothes.
    The thatched huts leaked, and the cold wind blew.
    They toiled like oxen and horses all their lives, who would they rely on in their declining years?
    Fortunately, after Liberation, cooperatives were established, and this old man finally doesn't shed tears.
    Today, with the establishment of the great People's Commune, the iron tree blooms and the heart wants to fly.
    Spending my old age in the Respect for the Elderly Home, with warm rooms and sufficient food, I smile contentedly.
    Listening to the radio, playing chess, leisurely watering the vegetable garden, raising fat chickens.
    Enjoying happiness in old age, becoming younger, I wake up laughing several times at night.
    When Chairman came here that day, he asked about my well-being and checked my clothes and bedding.
    He told me to take good care of my health, because communism will be even better.
    With tears in my eyes, I had no words to answer, smiling and looking at Chairman, I shouted "Long live!"

    铁树开花心想飞
    ——记徐水人民公社幸福院一老人的话
    纪鹏大清、民国、汪蒋贼，哪朝不是高官肥？花天酒地住洋楼，民食糠菜草中睡；夏不遮体冬穿单，草屋破漏冷风吹；牛马一生精力尽，风烛残年依靠谁？幸而解放搞合作，老汉这才不垂泪。今天办起大公社，铁树开花心想飞；敬老院里度晚年，房暖食足笑微微；听听广播下盘棋，闲浇菜园养鸡肥；白头享福变年青，夜间笑醒好几回；主席那天到这来，问寒问暖看衣被；让把身体保养好，共产主义还要美；满眼热泪无话答，笑望主席喊万岁。
