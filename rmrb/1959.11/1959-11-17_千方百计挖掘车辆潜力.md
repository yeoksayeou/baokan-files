    Transportation is a continuation of production. The more production, the greater the transportation task. At present, a magnificent production upsurge has formed and is constantly developing on the national economic front. Under the situation of a great production upsurge, the transportation department, as a bridge between urban and rural areas, industry and agriculture, production and consumption, bears an even heavier task; and the railway transportation, known as the main force, bears an especially heavy transportation task.
    How can railway transportation adapt to the excellent situation and meet the needs of production and construction? First of all, we must exhaust every means to tap the potential of existing vehicles. Every day, about six or seven hundred vehicles nationwide are undergoing regular maintenance and are parked in the depot, unable to be put into operation. If all repair departments complete the annual repair task ahead of schedule, and complete the repair of the hundreds of vehicles that need to be deducted for regular maintenance every day in the last half month of this year in advance, ensuring good quality and delivering them for use as soon as possible, then, based on an estimate of 500 vehicles not being deducted for regular maintenance every day, the country can add 7,500 operating vehicles in the last fifteen days of this year. This shows that the potential for vehicle maintenance is very large. Secondly, improving the technical equipment of vehicles and increasing the utilization rate of vehicles are also important measures to tap the potential of vehicles. Transforming a large number of boxcars into boxcar-gondola dual-purpose vehicles can expand their use from originally being limited to loading moisture-sensitive goods to universally loading open-top goods such as coal and ore. This will play a significant role in reducing vehicle empty returns and increasing transportation capacity. In addition, attention must be paid to strengthening the daily maintenance of vehicles, making full use of all gaps in time before loading and after unloading, carefully inspecting and thoroughly repairing, and not releasing any faulty vehicles.
    The Qiqihar Vehicle Depot has set an example in tapping the potential of vehicles. Railway vehicle workers across the country have been mobilized to learn from advanced experience and are determined to fight hard in the fourth quarter to meet the heavy winter transportation tasks. We wish them brilliant achievements in this battle.

    千方百计挖掘车辆潜力
    运输工作是生产的继续。生产越多，运输任务也就越大。目前，全国经济战线上一个波澜壮阔的生产高涨已经形成而且不断发展。在生产大高涨的形势下，作为城市和乡村、工业和农业、生产和消费之间的桥梁——运输部门所担负的任务也加倍繁重；而号称主力军的铁路运输，所担负的运输任务则尤为繁重。
    铁路运输怎样才能适应大好形势，满足生产建设的需要呢？首先，要千方百计挖掘现有车辆的潜力。全国每天大约有六、七百辆定期检修车，停在车库里，不能投入运用。如果所有修造部门提前完成全年修车任务，把今年最后半个月内每天需要扣下送去定期检修的数百辆车，提前修完，保证质量良好及早地交付使用。这样，按每天不扣定期检修车五百辆估算，在今年的最后十五天内就能为国家多增加七千五百辆运用车。这说明车辆检修的潜力是很大的。其次，改进车辆的技术装备，提高车辆的利用率，也是挖掘车辆潜力的一个重要措施。把大量棚车改造成棚敞两用车，可以使它从原来只限于装载怕湿货物，扩大到普遍地装载煤炭、矿石等敞装货物。这对于减少车辆回空，提高运输能力，将起很大作用。此外，须注意加强车辆的日常维修养护，充分利用车辆在装车前、卸货后的一切空隙时间，认真检查，彻底修理，不放出一辆故障车。
    齐齐哈尔车辆段在挖掘车辆潜力等方面作出了榜样。全国铁路车辆职工，已经动员起来学习先进经验，决心大战第四季度，迎接繁重的冬季运输任务。我们预祝他们在这一战役中，取得辉煌成就。
