Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County in Guizhou Province is a high and cold mountainous area. Only 5% of the county is low-lying valley land, the remaining 70% belongs to semi-cool mountainous areas (about 2,000 meters above sea level), and 25% belongs to cool mountainous areas (about 2,600 meters above sea level). Among the county's one million mu of cultivated land, acidic soils are more common than neutral soils, and most of them are sandy grey paddy soil and clayey yellow mud, hematite mud, erba mud, and clay, etc. Sandy soils are loose, permeable, and lack organic matter; clayey soils do not allow air to circulate easily, becoming muddy when it rains and hard when it is sunny, making it difficult to decompose organic matter and for crops to take root. Cultivation techniques have always been rough here, and the soil tillage layer is very thin. A 1953 survey in Zhuopu Township found that the thickest soil was five to six inches, and the thinnest was one to two inches. Therefore, these lands generally only produce buckwheat, oats, potatoes, and flax (oil crops). Some can also grow corn, but the plants are very small. For many years, a tragic folk song has been circulating: "Zhuopu, Goujiezhi (two township names), buckwheat, wheat, and potatoes for a living. Want to eat corn, unless you're in postpartum confinement; want to eat rice, you'll have to wait for the next life." In the evil old society, this was indeed a true reflection of the lives of all ethnic groups in the cool mountain areas.

As early as the spring of 1953, the Weining County Party Committee began soil improvement work. First, it systematically summarized the "guest soil method" created by farmer Huang Xingshun in the cool mountain area, the "black stone intercropping" method created by farmer Zu Wentang in the semi-cool mountain area, the "fertile mud pressing" method created by farmer Xie Chuansheng in the low-lying area, and the experiences of some farmers in other places using lime, sea soil, nitre mud, rock ash, qing mud, silt sand, and soil manure for pressing and improving the soil. These experiences were promoted year by year with the increasing development, consolidation, and improvement of mutual aid and cooperation organizations. During the First Five-Year Plan period, nearly 110,000 mu were improved, accounting for slightly less than 11% of the total cultivated area, averaging 22,000 mu per year. These improved soils had significant yield increases compared to before the improvement. For example, the more than 2,000 mu of land improved by the Caohai Commune generally increased production by 30% to 50%, and individual plots increased by more than three times. Last winter and this spring, Weining County launched an unprecedented soil improvement campaign. By the time of spring plowing, a total of 400,000 mu of land had been improved, exceeding the county party committee's original plan by 25%, equivalent to three times the area improved during the First Five-Year Plan period.

Weining County has inexhaustible natural resources, which is an extremely favorable condition for soil improvement. The forests and grasslands are vast, and leaves and weeds can be made into high-quality fertilizer. The forests have qing mud layers up to five to two city-inches thick, black stone interlayers of black thin-layered carbonaceous shale, and nitre mud, peat (also called sea soil), etc. Others such as ditch mud, pond mud, well mud, waterlogged fields, courtyard mud, house foundation mud, old wall mud, roadside mud, rock mud, thousand-foot mud, etc., are everywhere. These are all good raw materials for soil improvement, and Weining County makes full use of these raw materials to improve the soil.

The specific methods and effects of soil improvement in Weining County are introduced below:

(1) Improving lean soil with fertile mud - All kinds of fertile mud contain organic matter and other nutrients. Using it to improve the soil not only increases the fertility of the land and thickens the soil tillage layer, but also makes the heavy soil loose and the sandy soil tight. Fertile mud is generally dug and used after the autumn harvest until before the spring plowing; some is dug in the summer and used in the winter. According to Xiaohai Agricultural Cooperative's improvement of 72 mu of lean land in 1957, the yield per mu was 231 jin, an increase of three and a half times compared to the original yield. Huang Xingshun of Zhuopu Township used 150 baskets of small yellow mud and 200 baskets of well bottom fertile mud to improve a half-mu of grey paddy soil before the spring plowing in 1953, enabling this lean land, which originally only produced 50 jin of potatoes, to produce a total of 199 jin of corn and red beans.

(2) Improving lean land with soil fertilizer (made of humus seepage mud, manure, and water) - Spread the soil fertilizer on the ground before the spring plowing, and it will be ready after plowing. Farmer An Zhengqing of Longgu Township used 52 baskets of soil fertilizer to improve one mu of lean land before the spring plowing in 1953, and as a result, the yield of corn and red beans on this plot increased from the original 137 jin to 315 jin.

(3) Improving clay soil with black stone interlayers - Black stone interlayers have a strong water absorption capacity. They are stone-like when not exposed to wind, rain, or sunlight, and become loose after being exposed to wind, rain, and sunlight. Black stone interlayers contain 0.5% phosphorus and have a calcium carbonate reaction. Mixing them into clay soil can make the soil loose, reduce acidity, and increase phosphate fertilizer. According to a comparative experiment by the original Caohai First Agricultural Cooperative: The natural conditions of the land and all cultivation measures were the same, but the three mu of land improved with black stone interlayers produced 362 jin of grain per mu, an increase of 2.7 times compared to the three mu of land that were not improved. Zu Wentang of this cooperative used black stone interlayers to improve a clayey soil, described as "a knife when it's sunny, a mess when it rains", in 1953, increasing the grain yield from 280 jin to 420 jin. According to local experience, black stone interlayers are generally dug and used immediately, with 40,000 to 60,000 jin applied per mu.

(4) Improving lean land and clayey soil with sea soil (i.e., peat) - Sea soil contains relatively rich organic matter and nitrogen (1.363%), phosphorus (0.244%), and potassium (1.634%). The layer slightly black in color above the sea soil, called the sea soil cover, is generally used to improve the soil. Shuanghe Cooperative used it to improve yellow mud land, increasing the yield by 33.3%.

(5) Improving lean land with nitre mud - First, the nitre is extracted, and then the residue is transported to the field; some do not extract the nitre and transport it directly to the field for application. In 1957, Jianshan Cooperative in Yanji Township applied 14,000 jin of nitre mud per mu of lean land, improving a total of 25 mu. As a result, these lands produced 405 jin of grain per mu in the same year, an increase of 11.5% compared to the original yield. The reason for the yield increase from applying nitre mud is that nitre mud contains nitrogen, which can directly act as a fertilizer.

(6) Improving sandy or clayey soils with the "guest soil method" - Since both of these soils have shortcomings, then exchanging them with each other and mixing them together will have the effect of complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses. Putting sandy grey paddy soil into clayey yellow mud land will reduce the clayiness of the yellow mud land, making it loose, easier to aerate and drain, and easier for crops to take root. Putting yellow mud into grey paddy soil will increase the stickiness of the grey paddy soil, making it tight, able to retain water and fertilizer, and enhancing its wind resistance. Liping Cooperative in Guandai Township used clay soil to improve 1.45 mu of sandy soil, increasing the grain yield from 70 jin to 280 jin. The specific method is to apply 50,000 to 100,000 jin of foreign soil per mu, first spreading the alien soil evenly on the ground, and then plowing and harrowing twice to fully mix them.

(7) Improving acidic soils with lime - Generally speaking, lime can be used to improve soils in places that produce coal, such as coal mountain land, yellow mud mixed with coal mountain land, etc., soils where rhododendrons, bean sprouts, iron wolf tracks, ferns, and chestnuts grow, and places where large yellow mud, small yellow mud, yellow mud mixed with iron ore are formed by round-stemmed stones, white flint, black flint, cold sandstone, and yellow sandstone. When applying lime, the amount should be determined according to the strength of the soil's acidity. Coal mountain land, yellow mud mixed with coal mountain land, and grey paddy soil have the greatest acidity, and 1,500 jin can be applied per mu, protecting it for four years; small yellow mud, large yellow mud, yellow mud mixed with broad bean sandstone, yellow mud mixed with iron ore, flint land, cold sandstone land, and yellow mud mixed with cold sandstone land have slightly lower acidity, and 1,000 jin can be applied per mu, protecting it for six years; dead yellow mud, hematite mud, and red mud can be applied at 800 jin per mu, protecting it for six years; coal clay paddy fields also have relatively low acidity, and 400 jin can be applied per mu, protecting it for two years; duck dung mud paddy fields can be applied at 200 jin per mu, protecting it for three years. If too much is applied too frequently, it will make the soil worse and reduce yields. Therefore, lime needs to be applied properly in order to achieve the effect of increasing production. In addition, if compost, pen manure, soil fertilizer, or other fertilizers can be used in conjunction, the effect will be even greater. The best time for improvement is after the autumn harvest. The specific method is to spread the lime evenly on the plate ground, and then plow and harrow two to three times so that it can be closely mixed with the soil.

(8) Burning soil to improve the soil - Burning corn stalks or other weeds and shrubs, and then covering the clods on top of them, will increase the potassium fertilizer in the clods; at the same time, it also has the effect of killing insects.

(9) Improving clayey soil with silt sand - Over the years, whenever the rainy season comes, floods will bring silt sand to low-lying areas. Using silt sand to improve clayey soil will make the soil loose.

(10) Digging water-soaked ditches to improve rust water paddy fields - Yingping Cooperative in Jule Township improved 10 mu in 1957, with a yield of 150 jin of rice per mu, equivalent to three times the original yield. The specific method is to dig large ditches 3 to 5 city-feet wide in large fields, and small ditches 1 to 3 city-feet wide in small fields, to a depth that can soak out the rust water. Fill the ditches with sand and gravel, and then cover them with soil.

(11) Rotating and intercropping herbaceous plants and legumes is also a way to improve the soil. Herbaceous plants can strengthen the structure of soil aggregates, while legumes can increase the nitrogen fertilizer in the soil.

    威宁县是怎样改良土壤的
    中共威宁县委农村工作部
    贵州省威宁彝族回族苗族自治县，是高寒山区。全县只有5％低平的河谷地带，其余70％属半凉山区（拔海二千米左右），25％属凉山区（拔海二千六百米左右）。全县一百万亩耕地中，含酸性重的土壤多于中性土壤，而且大部分属于砂性重的灰泡泥和粘性重的黄泥、马血泥、耳巴泥、胶泥等。砂性重的土壤土质疏松，容易透水，缺乏有机质；粘性重的土壤空气不易流通，天雨泞泥，天晴坚硬，有机质的分解很困难，农作物的根扎不下去。这里历来耕作技术粗糙，土壤耕层很薄。1953年在灼圃乡调查，厚的五至六寸，薄的一至二寸。因此，这些土地一般只能出产荞子、燕麦、洋芋（马铃薯）和蓝花子（油料作物），有的虽然也能种包谷，但植株很小。多少年来，流传着这样一首悲惨的民谣：“灼圃、狗街子（两个乡名），荞、麦、洋芋过日子。想吃包谷饭，除非坐月子；想吃大米饭，要到下辈子。”在万恶的旧社会里，这的确是凉山地带各族人民生活的真实写照。
    中共威宁县委早在1953年春天，就着手土壤改良工作。首先系统地总结了凉山地带农民黄兴顺创造的“客土法”，半凉山地带农民祖文堂创造的“黑石夹压地”，低平地带农民谢传声创造的“肥泥压地”，以及其他地方一些农民用的石灰、海土、硝泥、岩灰、箐泥、淤砂、土粪等压地改良土壤的经验，这些经验随着互助合作组织的日益发展、巩固和提高而逐年推广。在第一个五年计划期间，全县共改良了近十一万亩，占总耕地面积的11％弱。平均每年改良二万二千亩。这些改良后的土壤和改良前比较有显著的增产效果，如草海公社改良的二千多亩土地，普遍增产30％到50％，个别地块增产在三倍以上。去冬今春，威宁县展开了一个空前规模的改良土壤运动，到春耕为止，全县共改良四十万亩土地，超过县委原计划的25％，相当于第一个五年计划期间改良土壤的三倍。
    威宁县有取之不尽、用之不竭的各种自然资源，这对改良土壤来说是一个极为有利的条件。森林、草场宽敞，树叶和杂草可以制成优质肥料。森林里有厚达五市寸到二市尺的箐泥，有黑色薄层炭质页岩的黑石夹，有硝泥、草炭（又叫海土）等。其他如沟泥、塘泥、井泥、滥田、院坝泥、屋基泥、老墙泥、路旁泥、岩泥、千脚泥等，到处都有。这些都是改良土壤的好原料，威宁县就是充分利用这些原料来改良土壤的。
    现在把威宁县改良土壤的具体办法及其效果介绍如下：
    （1）用肥泥改良瘦土——各种肥泥都含有有机质和其它养分，用它来改良土壤，不但能提高土地肥力和增厚土地耕层，而且还能使粘重的变得疏松，砂重的变得紧密。肥泥一般都是在秋收后到春耕前随挖随用；也有夏季挖好放到冬季用的。据小海农业社1957年改良的七十二亩瘦地，亩产二百三十一斤，比原产增加了三倍半；灼圃乡的黄兴顺于1953年春耕前用了一百五十箩小黄泥和二百箩井底肥泥改良了一块半亩地的灰泡土，使这块原来只能出产洋芋五十斤的瘦地，生产了包谷、红豆共一百九十九斤。
    （2）用土肥（腐植质渗泥、粪、水沤制而成）改良瘦地——春耕前把土肥撒在地里，经过犁翻即成。龙姑乡农民安正清在1953年春耕前用五十二箩土肥改良了一亩瘦地，结果这块地的包谷、红豆产量从原来的一百三十七斤提高到三百一十五斤。
    （3）用黑石夹改良粘土——黑石夹的吸水性能强，在不见风、雨、阳光的状态下，呈石块状，经过风吹、雨淋、日晒之后，就变疏松起来。黑石夹含磷质0.5％，呈碳酸钙反映，混入粘地可使土壤变松，降低酸度，增加磷肥。据原草海第一农业社对比试验：土地的各种自然条件与各项耕作措施都相同，可是用黑石夹改良的三亩地，亩产粮食三百六十二斤，比未改良的三亩地增产二点七倍。这个社的祖文堂在1953年用黑夹石改良了一块“天晴一把刀，下雨一包糟”的胶泥地，使粮食产量从二百八十斤一跃为四百二十斤。按照当地经验，黑石夹一般是随挖随用，每亩施放四至六万斤为宜。
    （4）用海土（即草炭）改良瘦地和粘性重的土壤——海土含有较丰富的有机质和氮（1.363％）、磷（0.244％）、钾（1.634％）。紧邻海土的上面，有一层略呈黑色土，叫海土盖子，一般都用它来改良土壤。双河社用它改良黄泥地，单产提高33.3％。
    （5）用硝泥改良瘦地——先把硝熬出来，再把渣滓运进地里；也有的不熬硝，直接运进地里施用。严家乡尖山社在1957年每亩瘦地施用了一万四千斤硝泥，共改良了二十五亩，结果这些地当年粮食亩产四百零五斤，比原产量增加了11.5％。施用硝泥增产的原因是，硝泥里含有氮素，可以直接起肥效作用。
    （6）用“客土法”改良砂性重或粘性重的土壤——这两种土壤既然都有缺点。那末，把它们互相交换一下，使之混合起来，便会起到取长补短的作用。把砂性重的灰泡泥放进粘性重的黄泥地里去，黄泥地就会减低粘性，变得疏松起来，也就易于通气和透水，农作物也比较容易扎根。把黄泥放进灰泡地里去，灰泡地就会增加粘性，变得紧密，能保水和保肥，并增强了抗风的能力。管戴乡犁坪社用粘性土改良了一点四五亩砂性地，粮食产量由七十斤增加到二百八十斤。具体办法是每亩用“客土”五万到十万斤不等，先把外来的异性土壤匀铺在地面上，再犁耖二道，使它们充分混合。
    （7）用石灰改良酸性重的土壤——一般说来，凡是产煤的地方，如煤山地、黄泥夹煤山地等，生长艳山红花、豆芽草、铁狼迹草、蕨箕、毛栗等植物的土壤，以及由圆秆石、白火石、黑火石、冷砂石、黄砂岩等形成的大黄泥、小黄泥、黄泥夹铁矿的地方，均可用石灰改良土壤。施用石灰时，应按土壤含酸的强弱而定用量。煤山地、黄泥夹煤山地、灰泡泥等，酸性最大，每亩可施一千五百斤，施一次保四年；小黄泥、大黄泥、黄泥夹豆瓣砂、黄泥夹铁矿、火石地、冷砂地、黄泥夹冷砂地等，酸性稍低，每亩可施一千斤，施一次保六年；死黄泥、马血泥、红泥等，每亩可施八百斤，施一次保六年；煤胶泥田，酸度也比较低，每亩可施四百斤，施一次可保二年；鸭屎泥田每亩可施二百斤，施一次保三年。如果施用过多过勤，反而会使土壤变坏，产量降低。因此，石灰需要施用得当，才能发挥增产的效果。此外，如能把堆肥、圈肥、土肥或其他肥料配合使用，收效更大。改良时间最好是在秋收后进行，具体作法是把石灰均匀地撒在板地上面，然后犁耖二至三道，使其能与土壤密切混合。
    （8）烧火熏土改良法——用包谷椿或其他杂草、灌木等烧燃，再把垡子壅在上面，这样，就会使垡子里增加钾肥；同时，还有灭虫的作用。
    （9）淤砂改良粘重土——历年来，一到雨季，山洪一涨，低洼地方都有淤砂，用淤砂改良粘重地，便会使土壤疏松起来。
    （10）挖浸水沟改良锈水田——居乐乡营平社1957年改良十亩，亩产稻谷一百五十斤，相当于原产的三倍。具体办法是：在大田内挖大沟三至五市尺宽，小田内挖小沟一至三市尺宽，深度以能浸出锈水为止。沟内装上砂石，再盖以泥土就可以了。
    （11）把草本植物与豆科植物实行轮作、间种，也是改良土壤的办法。草本植物能加强土壤团粒的结构，豆科植物则能增加土壤的氮肥。
