Comrades, representatives of advanced units and advanced producers, you must not be arrogant or rash. You must study humbly and strive to maintain the advanced title of your unit and yourself. Moreover, you must promote the communist spirit and help other units and individuals to catch up with the advanced level. The Party Central Committee believes that you will certainly be able to complete this glorious task.

    先进单位的代表和先进生产者同志们不仅要不骄不躁，虚心学习，努力使自己的单位和自己保持先进的称号，而且要发扬共产主义的风格，帮助别的单位和别人赶上先进的水平。党中央相信你们一定能够完成这个光荣的任务。
