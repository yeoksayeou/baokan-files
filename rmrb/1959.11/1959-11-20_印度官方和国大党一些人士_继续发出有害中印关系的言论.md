Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 19th: Following Premier Zhou Enlai's reasonable proposal on November 7th for resolving the Sino-Indian border dispute, some Indian officials and figures in the Congress Party continue to issue statements harmful to Sino-Indian relations.

On November 8th, Indian Finance Minister Desai described the actions of Indian troops invading Chinese territory and carrying out armed provocations as "incidents of Chinese aggression against India." He avoided mentioning the Chinese government's proposal for peaceful negotiation to resolve the Sino-Indian border issue, but emphasized, "We are already strong and capable enough to bravely defend our country."

Desai had just concluded visits to the United States, Britain, and Japan, where he discussed aid to India. After returning to India, he said in Ahmedabad on the 5th that the recent border incidents had aroused "doubt" about China's sincerity. He said, "Perhaps we must thank the Chinese invaders for educating us on whom we should believe." He proclaimed that if the situation required it, the government was prepared to stop all expenditures on planned projects and transfer the money to defense needs.

In a speech in New Delhi on November 8th, Home Minister Pant attacked China as "foolish and muddle-headed."

Subsequently, Pant delivered speeches attacking China for three consecutive days on the 11th, 12th, and 13th. On the one hand, he stated that India "will not change our policy of peace and non-alignment in the slightest," and "we will continue to be friendly with all countries, including China." On the other hand, in a speech at a rally in Bhubaneswar on the 11th, he smeared China for carrying out "aggression" against India and doing a "bad thing." The next day, he insisted that the Sino-Indian border conflict caused by Indian troops invading Chinese territory was provoked by the Chinese government's "unprovoked act of aggression supported by force." He clamored that India was militarily strong enough to "crush" China's "aggressive ambitions."

Pant attacked China, saying, "The aggressor must withdraw from the place where the aggression occurred and withdraw the demands made on the territory of the Indian Federation due to a spirit of expansion, so that a peaceful way can be found to resolve the real border dispute."

At a gathering of retired soldiers on the 12th, Indian Army Chief of Staff General Thimayya flaunted India's military strength, saying that the Indian army was already strong enough to defend "these mountains" (in northern India bordering China). He said, "We will defend them with blood."

Indian Minister of Food and Agriculture Patil also clamored in a speech in Mumbai on the 15th that in order to maintain the integrity of the country's territory, the Indian "people should even be prepared to sacrifice." Patil had just returned to India after a trip to Europe. Speaking in London on the 11th, he also used the Sino-Indian border issue to promote closer Indo-Pakistani relations. He said, "What India is encountering today, Pakistan may encounter tomorrow."

Mrs. Pandit, the Indian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, who is currently visiting the United States, actually demanded that China unilaterally withdraw its troops in Indiana on the 16th. She said, "India will not hold discussions until China withdraws its troops." She also said that if China does not withdraw its troops from the disputed Indian border areas, India will take strong military action.

Rami, the General Secretary of the Indian Congress Party, stated in a conversation with reporters in Asawada that China's proposal for a meeting between the prime ministers of the two countries must be considered in an unemotional and calm atmosphere. However, he described the reasonable proposal made by the Chinese government for the Chinese and Indian troops to withdraw twenty kilometers each as "dangerous and unworkable." At the same time, Rami attacked the Communist Party of India and attempted to find an excuse to persecute the Communist Party. He said that if the Communist Party or any other party unfortunately proves to be a factor endangering our national defense, no government can allow it to carry out unpatriotic sabotage. He said that on the issue of national defense, the government does not need to and should not hesitate to take appropriate action in a timely manner to deal with such behavior on any side.

Debar, the former chairman of the Indian Congress Party, also published an article in the party's organ publication "Economic Review" published on the 16th, and tried his best to eliminate the influence of the Chinese government's claim on the peaceful settlement of the Sino-Indian border issue among the Indian people. He said, "The Chinese are acting deliberately and with determination." "It would be absolutely rash if we think these aggressions are foolish or stupid acts and ignore them." He even said that one must never rest easy, "an international conflict in which one party has already started using force is not a small conflict, and its outcome may be armed conflict."

### 印度官方和国大党一些人士  继续发出有害中印关系的言论

    印度官方和国大党一些人士
    继续发出有害中印关系的言论
    新华社19日讯　新德里消息：印度官方和国大党一些人士在周恩来总理11月7日提出解决中印边界纠纷的合理建议以后，继续发出有害印中关系的言论。
    印度财政部长德赛8日把印度军队侵入中国领土进行武装挑衅的行动，说成是“中国侵犯印度的事件”。他避而不谈中国政府谋求和平协商解决中印边界问题的建议，却着重说，“我们已经很强大，很有能力，足以英勇地保卫我们的国家。”
    德赛刚刚结束对美国、英国、日本的访问，同这些国家讨论了对印度的援助问题。他回到印度后，5日曾经在阿麦达巴说，最近边界事件已经引起对中国的诚意的“怀疑”。他说，“或许我们必须感谢中国入侵者教育了我们究竟应当相信谁”。他宣扬，如果局势需要的话，政府准备停止计划工程方面的一切开支，把这笔钱转用在国防需要方面。
    内政部长潘特8日在新德里发表的讲话中，攻击中国是“愚蠢的和糊涂的”。
    在这以后，潘特在11、12、13日连续三天发表讲话，攻击中国。他一方面表示，印度“丝毫不会改变我们的和平和不结盟的政策”，“我们将继续同一切国家友好，其中包括中国。”另一方面他11日在步伴内斯瓦尔一个集会上发表讲话时，又诬蔑中国对印度进行了“侵略”，是做了一件“坏事”。第二天，他又硬说，由于印度军队侵入中国领土而造成的中印边界冲突，是由中国政府“在武力支持下的无端侵略行动”所挑起的。他叫嚷，印度在军事上强大，足以“粉碎”中国的“侵略野心”。
    潘特攻击中国说，“侵略者必须从发生侵略的地方撤退，撤回由于一种扩张精神而对印度联邦领土提出的要求，这样才可能找出和平的方法解决真正的边界纠纷”。
    印度陆军参谋长蒂迈雅将军12日在一次退役军人聚会上炫耀印度的军事力量，他说，印度军队已经强大到足以保卫（同中国接界的印度北部的）这些山岭”。他说，“我们将以鲜血来保卫它们”。
    印度粮食和农业部长帕蒂尔15日在孟买发表讲话时也叫嚷为了保持国家领土的完整，印度“人民甚至应该准备牺牲”。帕蒂尔刚结束在欧洲旅行后回到印度。11日在伦敦发表讲话时，还利用中印边界问题鼓吹印巴关系应密切起来。他说，“今天印度遭到的事情，巴基斯坦可能会在明天遭到”。
    目前正在美国访问的印度驻英国高级专员潘迪特夫人16日在美国印第安纳州居然要中国单方面撤军。她说，“在中国撤退军队之前，印度将不会进行讨论”。她还说，如果中国不把它的军队撤出争执中的印度边境地区的话，印度将采取强有力的军事行动。
    印度国大党总书记拉米在阿萨瓦达对新闻记者发表谈话时曾表示：必须在毫不动感情和心平气和的气氛中考虑中国关于两国总理举行会谈的建议。但是，他又把中国政府提出的中印双方军队各后撤二十公里的合理建议说成是“危险的，也是行不通的”。拉米同时攻击印度共产党，并且企图为迫害共产党寻找借口。他说，如果共产党或者任何其他党派不幸证明是危害我国国防的一个因素的话，没有一个政府能够允许它进行非爱国的破坏行动。他说，在国防问题上，政府用不着也不应该犹豫不决和不及时采取适当的行动来对付任何方面的这种行为。
    印度国大党前主席德巴在16日出版的这个党的机关刊物“经济评论”上发表文章，也竭力企图消除中国政府关于和平解决中印边界问题的主张在印度人民中所发生的影响。他说，“中国人是处心积虑地和有决心地采取行动的”。“如果我们认为这些侵略是糊涂或愚蠢的行为而不予重视，那将是绝对轻率的”。他甚至说，绝不能高枕无忧，“一方已经开始使用武力的一个国际冲突不是小冲突，它的结局可能是武装冲突”。
