    Coal Industry Models "Offer Treasures"
    Representatives of Fourteen Trades Propose Competition to Workers in the Same Trades Nationwide
    Demanding that, starting from November, the average monthly output of all coal mining faces and the average monthly progress of tunneling faces should increase by about 10% compared to the previous ten months; the construction period for new mines should, on average, meet the requirements of "three years for large mines, two years for medium mines, and one year for small mines"; the monthly efficiency of drilling rigs should increase by another 10% compared to the average efficiency in September.

    The National Heroes Congress Coal Industry System Advanced Experience Exchange Conference concluded today. Over the past six days, the attending representatives thoroughly exchanged 187 items of advanced experience in detail, which not only enriched the 36 major experiences originally promoted by the coal industry system, but also added many new experiences. These experiences, after being summarized and organized, will be widely promoted nationwide.

    The implementation of the four (shift) eight (hour) staggered operation method in production management and organization was a key focus of this experience exchange conference. Representatives from 58 advanced coal mining units unanimously agreed that the four-eight staggered operations promoted by Fushun Victory Mine, Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Mine, Zibo Xiazhuang Mine, Yangquan No. 4 Mine, and Fengfeng No. 4 Mine, among others, were relatively mature experiences. After these coal mines implemented the staggered operation, they quickly demonstrated seven major benefits: the time for coal mining significantly increased, the combination of work and rest was improved, the utilization rate of equipment increased, production costs decreased, the unity between work teams was further strengthened, safe production was better than before, and the promotion of advanced experience was faster. The representatives gave this advanced experience a very high evaluation, considering it a major revolution in coal mine production organization and an important measure for large-scale high yield in the coal industry.

    Many advanced experiences, after extensive exchange, discussion, and supplementation by the representatives, have become more complete and enriched. For example, the eight methods of prop withdrawal created by Zhang Wen, a prop withdrawal expert from Kailuan Coal Mine, were originally a relatively complete experience; this time, after discussions with other advanced producers in the same trade, a "double rope end segmented prop withdrawal method" was added, making this experience even more complete. The set of methods for maintaining electric conveyors created by "electric conveyor master" Song Shaoxian can keep the electric conveyor running safely; at this experience exchange conference, the experience of quickly moving conveyors created by Wang Fengyuan was combined with the experience created by Song Shaoxian, which can more fully utilize the role of electric conveyors and ensure continuous high yield on the working face. In terms of tunneling, through this conference, not only was the advanced tunneling method of using long drill rods to dig roadways by the Zhuang Hongsheng rapid tunneling team of Xuzhou Coal Mine further affirmed, but also the rapid tunneling experiences of Zhang Wanfu, Wang Jinsheng, Cui Guoshan and other tunneling teams, whose working conditions were different from those of Zhuang Hongsheng, were mutually exchanged. These advanced experiences each have their own merits, strengths and weaknesses. After detailed research by the tunneling experts, they have now been integrated into a complete set of tunneling experiences. In other trades, many mature experiences have also been summarized, including the experience of using coal cutting machines by Zhang Yao, a coal cutting machine operator at Jiaohe Coal Mine, the experience of using pneumatic picks for coal mining by Wang Hengcheng of Benxi Coal Mine and Liu Benkun of Pingxiang Coal Mine, the experience of rapid well drilling by the Wu Xiulun team of Xuzhou Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau, the experience of rapid drilling by the Wang Haixiang drilling rig of the Henan 101 Coalfield Geological Exploration Team and the Du Qingrong drilling rig of the Heilongjiang 110 Exploration Team, as well as the experience of safe production for ten years by the Liu Jiuxue coal mining team of Jiaozuo Coal Mine and the Li Jiude drilling and tunneling worker of Jingxi Coal Mine.

    The Ministry of Coal Industry has decided to assign engineers to be responsible for organizing these experiences, printing them into booklets, and promoting them widely.

    The representatives unanimously believed that these advanced experiences are the magic weapons to ensure that they continue to create greater achievements, so they were enthusiastic and full of confidence. They said: "The Heroes Congress was 'virtual,' the Party pointed out the direction for us, and the exchange conference was 'real,' giving us methods." Everyone put forward guarantees, revised their production increase and conservation plans, and resolved to continue to be pioneers in the technical revolution and technical innovation, and to launch a new upsurge of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward. Many representatives also made phone calls, telegrams and wrote letters back, promptly telling the production site about the advanced experiences they had learned, and asking for immediate promotion.

    At the closing meeting on the 7th, representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers of fourteen trades also respectively proposed competition initiatives to workers in the same trades across the country. Hook-ups and counterpart competitions were also enthusiastically carried out among the representatives. At the meeting, the representatives also adopted a proposal to coal mine workers across the country to strive to complete the coal industry's production and construction plans for this year ahead of schedule and in an all-round way. The content of the proposal is: starting from November, the average monthly output of all coal mining faces should increase by about 10% compared to the average monthly output of the previous ten months; the average monthly progress of tunneling (stripping) faces should increase by about 10% compared to the previous ten months; the construction period for new mines should, on average, meet the requirements of "three years for large mines, two years for medium mines, and one year for small mines"; in terms of coalfield geological exploration, the monthly efficiency of drilling rigs (the footage drilled by each rig per month) should be increased by another 10% compared to the average efficiency in September. The proposal also proposed to make full preparations for continued leaps forward next year to ensure a good start in the first quarter of next year.

    The meeting was concluded by He Bingzhang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Coal Industry. He said that this meeting was very good and very successful. The gains of the meeting are mainly in two aspects: (1) clarified the direction, improved thinking, boosted morale, and enhanced confidence; (2) offered treasures, learned from the experience, enriched experience, and found solutions. He encouraged advanced producers to guard against arrogance and rashness, and always be a continuous revolutionary.

    煤炭工业标兵纷纷“献宝”
    十四个工种代表向全国同工种工人提出竞赛
    要求从11月份起，全体采煤工作面的平均月产量和掘进工作面平均月进度要比前十个月提高10％左右；建井工期平均达到“大型矿井三年、中型矿井二年、小型矿井一年”的要求；钻机台月效率比9月份的平均效率再提高10％。
    新华社7日讯　全国群英大会煤炭工业系统先进经验交流会议今天结束。在六天来的会议上，到会代表深入细致地交流了一百八十七项先进经验，因而不仅使煤炭工业系统原来推广的三十六项重大经验更加丰富，而且又增加了许多新的经验，这些经验经过总结和整理，将在全国普遍推广。
    在生产管理组织方面实行四（班）八（小时）交叉作业法，是这次经验交流会上的一项重点。来自五十八个先进煤矿单位的代表一致认为，抚顺胜利矿、开滦唐家庄矿、淄博夏庄矿、阳泉四矿、峰峰四矿等单位推行的四八交叉作业，都是比较成熟的经验。这些煤矿在试行交叉作业以后，迅速显示了七大好处：采煤时间显著增加，劳逸结合得好，设备利用率提高，生产成本降低，班组之间的团结进一步加强，安全生产搞得比以前更好，先进经验推广得快。代表们对于这项先进经验给予极高的评价，认为是煤矿生产组织上的一大革命，是煤炭工业大面积高产的重要措施。
    许多先进经验经过代表们广泛交流、讨论和补充以后，更加完整和充实了。例如开滦煤矿回柱能手张文创造的八种回柱方法，原是比较完整的经验；这次经过同工种的其他先进生产者讨论以后，又增加了一种“双绳头分段回柱法”，使这一经验更加完整。“电溜子主人”宋绍先创造的一套维护电溜子的方法，可以使电溜子经常安全运转；在这次经验交流会上，又把王凤元所创造的快速移溜子的经验，同宋绍先创造的经验结合了起来，这就更能充分发挥电溜子的作用，保证工作面持续不断的高产。在掘进方面，通过这次会议，不但进一步肯定了徐州煤矿庄洪生快速掘进队的用长钎子打巷道的先进掘进方法，而且还互相交流了跟庄洪生的工作条件不同的张万福、王金生、崔国山等掘进队的快速掘进经验。这些先进经验各有千秋，互有长短，经过掘进能手们的详细研究，现在也已经综合成为一套完整的掘进经验。在其他工种方面，也都总结出了不少成熟的经验。其中，包括蛟河煤矿截煤机手张尧的截煤机使用经验，本溪煤矿王恒成、萍乡煤矿刘本坤的风镐采煤经验，徐州煤矿基本建设局吴修伦班的快速打井经验，河南一○一煤田地质勘探队王海祥钻机和黑龙江省一一○勘探队杜清荣钻机的快速钻井经验，以及焦作煤矿刘九学采煤队、京西煤矿钻掘工李九德十年安全生产的经验等。
    煤炭工业部决定指派工程师负责整理这些经验，付印成册广泛推广。
    代表们一致认为，这些先进经验是保证他们继续创造更大成绩的法宝，因此热情高涨，信心百倍。他们说：“群英大会务了虚，党给我们指出了方向，交流会议务了实，给了我们办法。”大家纷纷提出保证，修订增产节约计划，决心继续做技术革命和技术革新中的急先锋，掀起学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进的竞赛新高潮。许多代表还打电话、电报和写信回去，把自己学到的先进经验及时告诉生产现场，要求立刻推广。
    在7日的闭幕会上，十四个工种的先进集体和先进生产者代表，还分别向全国同工种工人提出了竞赛倡议。在代表之间，也热烈开展了挂钩、对口赛。会上，代表们还通过了向全国煤矿职工提出的争取提前全面完成今年煤炭工业的生产和建设计划的倡议。倡议的内容是：从11月份起，全体采煤工作面的平均月产量要比前十个月的平均月产量提高10％左右；掘进（剥离）工作面平均月进度要比前十个月提高10％左右；建井工期平均达到“大型矿井三年、中型矿井二年、小型矿井一年”的要求；在煤田地质勘探方面，钻机台月效率（每台每月钻进进尺）要做到比9月份的平均效率再提高10％。倡议还提出要为明年继续跃进做好充分准备，保证明年第一季度实现开门红。
    会议最后由煤炭工业部副部长贺秉章作了总结。他说，这次会议开得很好，很成功。会议的收获主要有两方面：（一）明确了方向，提高了思想，鼓足了干劲，提高了信心；（二）献了宝，取了经，丰富了经验，找到了办法。他勉励先进生产者要戒骄戒躁，永远成为一个不断革命家。
