Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th: Under the guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, Shandong Province is rapidly advancing small enterprises while stepping up the construction of large and medium-sized enterprises. In the one year from last winter to the present, the number of small industrial units in the province has grown to over ten thousand. From January to October this year, the pig iron produced by small blast furnaces of 28 cubic meters or less accounted for about two-thirds of the province's total pig iron production; the output of county and commune-run small coal mines accounted for about one-fifth of the province's total coal production; and all cement production was undertaken by small factories. In industries such as chemical, electric power, machinery, and light industry, small-scale indigenous and foreign methods of production also occupy a very important position.

Shandong's small enterprises were established based on the principles of "getting started with indigenous methods first," "combining indigenous and foreign methods," and "self-reliance." After rectification and improvement since the beginning of this year, this vibrant new force has now embarked on a path of consolidation and sound development. Because small enterprises have the advantages of low investment, rapid construction, simple equipment, easy-to-master technology, and convenient use of decentralized resources, they have fully mobilized the enthusiasm of all parties and promoted the high-speed development of the province's industry. In the first ten months of this year, the iron produced by small blast furnaces of 28 cubic meters or less exceeded the province's total pig iron production last year; the output of county and commune-run small coal mines increased by 2.4 times compared to the entire year last year; and the cement produced by small cement plants increased by 1.6 times compared to the same period last year. At the same time, many places have also produced sulfuric acid, soda ash, and hydrochloric acid using indigenous methods. The pig iron produced by Shandong's small blast furnaces has not only strongly supported the province's economic construction but has also vigorously supported the production of key steel plants nationwide.

In terms of supporting agriculture, Shandong's county and commune-run small enterprises have made outstanding contributions. About half of the small enterprises widely distributed throughout the province directly serve agricultural production. In the first half of this year, they manufactured more than 20 million pieces of tillage, irrigation, harvesting, threshing, transportation, and other tools and small farm implements, and repaired more than 12 million pieces of various farm implements. In addition, they also produced a large amount of native fertilizer, granular fertilizer, and native pesticides. After entering the third quarter, employees of small enterprises throughout the province launched a competition to support the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting in rural areas, manufacturing nearly five million pieces of "Three Autumns" tools.

Shandong Province also encountered opposition from right-leaning opportunists in the development of small enterprises. They claimed that the "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" were "messing things up" and could not pass the "economic test" or the "technical test;" they attempted to make people doubt and waver in their confidence in the "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups," and even "close down shop." However, after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, through opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, the enormous power of Shandong's small enterprises has become increasingly apparent, and a comprehensive leap forward of high yield, high quality, and low consumption has emerged. Taking the iron and steel industry as an example, the pig iron production of small blast furnaces of 28 cubic meters or less was 100 in July, increased to 112.6 in August, increased to 184 in September, and further increased to 218 in October. At present, among the province's three-cubic-meter small blast furnaces, there are already five whose utilization coefficient is consistently stable above four, and sixty whose utilization coefficient is stable between two and three. The qualified rate of iron produced by these small blast furnaces is generally around 95%, and the coke ratio has been reduced to below one. The cost of many small blast furnaces has also been reduced to below 200 yuan. The output of small cement plants throughout the province increased by 41% in October compared to July, and the average grade has reached above 400. In small-scale chemical industry, there are also many examples of high quality and high yield. These facts of comprehensive leap forward with more, faster, better, and more economical results have powerfully refuted the fallacies of right-leaning opportunists and once again proved the absolute correctness of the policy of developing large, medium, and small enterprises simultaneously and combining indigenous and foreign methods.

    山东小企业立大功劳
    小高炉产铁占三分之二，小煤窑产煤占五分之一
    半数企业直接为农业服务，生产了大批工具化肥农药
    新华社济南20日电　在党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针指导下，山东省在加紧建设大中型企业的同时，小型企业也在飞速前进。从去年冬季到目前为止的一年的时间内，全省小型工业单位已经发展到十几万个。今年1月到10月份，二十八立方米以下的小高炉所产的生铁，约占全省生铁总产量的三分之二；县社小煤矿的产量，约占全省煤炭总产量的五分之一；水泥生产，全部由小型工厂担任。在化工、电力、机械、轻工等行业中，小型土法和洋法生产，也都占着极重要的地位。
    山东的小型企业是根据土法先上马、土洋结合和自力更生的原则建立起来的。经过今年以来的整顿和提高，这批生气勃勃的新生力量，现在已经走上巩固、健全的发展道路。由于小型企业具有投资少、建设快、设备简易、技术好掌握，以及便于利用分散资源等优越性，因而充分发挥了各个方面的积极性，促进了全省工业的高速度发展。今年前十个月，全省二十八立方米以下小高炉生产的铁，比去年全省生铁总产量还要多；县社小煤窑的产量，比去年全年增长二点四倍；小型水泥厂生产的水泥，比去年同期增长一点六倍。同时，不少地方还用土法生产出了硫酸、纯碱和盐酸。山东小高炉所生产的生铁，不仅有力地支援了本省经济建设，还大力支援了全国重点钢厂的生产。
    在支援农业方面，山东的县社小型企业更是立下了汗马功劳。广泛分布在全省各地的小型企业，约有半数是直接为农业生产服务的。今年上半年，它们共制造耕作、排灌、收割、脱粒、运输等工具及小农具二千多万件，修配各种农具一千二百多万件；此外，还生产了大量的土化肥、颗粒肥料、土农药等。进入第三季度以后，全省小型企业的职工又掀起了支援农村秋收、秋耕、秋种的竞赛热潮，共制造“三秋”工具近五百万件。
    山东省在发展小型企业中，也曾遇到右倾机会主义分子的反对。他们扬言“小土群”和“小洋群”“搞糟了”，过不了“经济关”和“技术关”；企图使人们对“小土群”和“小洋群”产生怀疑动摇，甚至“收摊子”。但是在党的八届八中全会以后，经过反右倾、鼓干劲，山东小型企业的巨大威力愈来愈明显地表现出来，出现了高产、优质、低耗的全面跃进。以炼铁工业为例，二十八立方米以下小高炉的生铁产量7月份为100，8月份增至112.6，9月增至184，10月份又增加到218。目前全省三立方米小高炉中，利用系数经常稳定在四以上的已有五座，稳定在二到三以上的已达六十座。这些小高炉所产生铁合格率一般在95％左右，焦比都降到一以下。许多小高炉的成本也已降到二百元以下。全省小型水泥厂的产量，10月份比7月份增长41％，平均标号已达四百号以上。在小型化学工业中，同样也有不少优质高产的典型。这些多快好省全面跃进的事实，有力地反击了右倾机会主义分子的谬论，再一次证明了大中小并举和土洋并举方针的绝对正确。（附图片）
