    Cotton, Oil Crops, Silkworm Cocoons, Tea, Rice and Wheat All Report High Yields
    Ginned Cotton Yields in Shanxi Cotton Areas Exceed 100 Jin per Mu
    Guangxi Tung Fruit, Tea Fruit, and Star Anise Production Increases Severalfold

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, November 2nd: The people's communes in Shanxi's cotton-producing areas have overcome a drought unseen in decades, achieving a large-scale cotton harvest. The Yuncheng Yuxiang People's Commune's 35,961 mu of cotton is expected to produce an average of 113 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 28% over the bumper harvest of last year. Among them, two mu of experimental fields are expected to produce an average of 520 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The Shimucun People's Commune in Houma City, with 28,307 mu of cotton fields, based on the current harvesting situation, is expected to produce an average of 150 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 26.55% over last year. The Yuci Mingqian People's Commune, which was recognized as a high-yield cotton unit in Shanxi last year, fully implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase this year. The 2,156 mu of cotton planted in the Mingqian, Xishagou, Xiaoyukou, and Xiaonanzhuang management areas is expected to produce an average of 139.5 jin of ginned cotton per mu.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, November 2nd: Tung fruit and tea fruit cover the hillsides, and the aroma of star anise fills the mountains. People's communes throughout Guangxi are busy picking the bountiful fruits of woody oil plants hanging from the branches.
    Reports of severalfold increases in production have spread from mountain to mountain. In Longjin County, which borders Vietnam, 25,000 mu of star anise forests are emitting a rich fragrance. Currently, 1.28 million jin of mature star anise have been picked, more than double the total output of last year. In the Du'an Yao Autonomous County, tung trees are laden with tung fruit, and 5.6 million jin (dry tung kernels) have already been picked, with this year's production expected to double last year. On the oil tea mountains of the Xiaopingshan Commune, more than 630,000 jin of tea fruit have been picked this year, an increase of more than double last year. As of the end of October, the area harvested in Guangxi's main woody oil plant production areas, such as Rong'an, Sanjiang, Longsheng, Mingshan, Mubian, and Ningming, accounted for only about 10% to 50% of the total, and this year's output is expected to greatly exceed last year's.
    Guangxi is mountainous, with forests of star anise trees, oil tea trees, and tung trees covering nearly 10 million mu. Tea oil is one of the main edible oils for the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi. Tung oil is a special export product of Guangxi. Star anise can be used to extract anise oil, which is supplied in large quantities to meet the needs of the state.
    Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd: A bumper harvest of summer and autumn silkworm cocoons has been achieved nationwide. Summer cocoon production increased by more than 40% compared to last year, and autumn cocoon production increased by about 10%.
    In Lezhi County, Sichuan, each summer silkworm egg sheet produced an average of 88 jin of cocoons, more than double the average yield in the province. In the famous silk-producing areas of Wuxi County, Jiangsu, and the Dongshi Commune in the suburbs of Hangzhou City, Zhejiang, each autumn silkworm egg sheet produced an average of 50 jin of cocoons. People's communes in the suburbs of Hangzhou City have even seen some high-yield records of more than 100 jin of cocoons per egg sheet.
    This is the first large-scale harvest of summer and autumn silkworm cocoons in our country's silk-producing areas after communization. This year, people's communes in various regions have fully utilized their superior conditions and waged a great battle against the drought and high temperatures between summer and autumn, achieving the goal of "autumn silkworms surpassing spring silkworms" and "a great harvest despite a great disaster."
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 2nd: A great harvest of autumn tea in the tea-producing areas of Fujian. As of October 25th, the province had purchased more than 78,000 dan of various types of autumn tea, 48% more than the total purchase volume of autumn tea last year, and more than 10% more than the purchase volume of spring tea this year. The great harvest of autumn tea in Fujian is the result of strengthened leadership by Party committees at all levels and the strengthened cultivation and management of tea gardens by commune members in the tea-producing areas in the movement to strive for "autumn tea surpassing spring tea and a great harvest for the whole year."
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 2nd: The 29,800 mu of double-season late rice in the Wangxian People's Commune, Liling County, Hunan, has been verified and accepted, with an average yield of 1,002 jin per mu, an increase of 80% over the Great Leap Forward of last year and more than double the yield of early rice this year. Some production teams have also seen some high-yield fields with yields of more than 2,000 jin per mu. One field in the Qingtang Brigade had an average yield of as high as 2,325 jin per mu, and 2.04 mu of land in the Wenchang Production Team of the Zhuangbu Brigade had an average yield of 2,617 jin per mu.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, November 2nd: The 5,900 mu of spring wheat in the Yongsheng People's Commune, Hangjinhou Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, averaged more than 512 jin per mu, double the yield of last year. The Yongsheng Commune is located downstream of the canal in the western part of the Hetao Plain, leaning against the Yin Mountains to the north, with low-lying terrain and highly alkaline soil. After communization last autumn, commune members of all ethnic groups conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Under the slogan of "moving alkaline soil," they pulled out the saline-alkali soil from more than 3,000 mu of land, brought good soil into the fields, carried out deep plowing, applied mixed fertilizer in layers, and irrigated relatively well. They also promptly eradicated jaundice. Therefore, this year's spring wheat grew exceptionally lush and strong, with full grains.

    据新华社太原2日电　山西各产棉区人民公社战胜几十年未有的大旱，获得棉花大面积丰收。运城虞乡人民公社的三万五千九百六十一亩棉花，预计平均每亩可产皮棉一百一十三斤，比大丰收的去年增长28％；其中有二亩试验田，平均每亩可产皮棉五百二十斤。侯马市史村人民公社二万八千三百零七亩棉田，根据目前收摘情况，预计平均每亩可产皮棉一百五十斤，比去年提高26.55％。去年被评为山西棉花丰产单位的榆次市鸣谦人民公社，今年全面贯彻农业增产“八字宪法”，鸣谦、西沙沟、小峪口、小南庄等四个管理区种的二千一百五十六亩棉花，平均每亩可产皮棉一百三十九斤半。
    据新华社南宁2日电　桐果茶果满山岗，千山万弄八角香，广西各地人民公社正忙着采摘挂满枝头的木本油料硕果。
    成倍增产的捷报，已从这山传到那山。与越南接壤的龙津县，二万五千亩八角林散发出浓郁的芳香，目前已摘回成熟的八角一百二十八万斤，超过去年总产量两倍多。都安瑶族自治县满山遍野油桐树上桐果累累，已采摘五百六十万斤（干桐仁），预计今年将比去年增产一倍。小平山公社的油茶山，今年采摘茶果六十三万多斤，比去年增产一倍多。到10月底，融安、三江、龙胜、鸣山、睦边、宁明等广西主要木本油料植物产地，采摘的面积才只占到10％到50％左右，今年产量预计都将大大超过去年。
    广西多山，八角树、油茶树、油桐树成林成片，面积近千万亩。茶油是广西各族人民主要食油之一；桐油是广西出口的特产；八角可以提炼茴油，大量供应国家需要。
    据新华社2日讯　全国夏秋蚕茧喜获丰收。夏茧比去年增产四成多，秋茧比去年增产一成左右。
    四川乐至县每张夏蚕蚕种平均产茧八十八斤，比本省一般产量高二倍多。著名的蚕丝产区江苏无锡县和浙江杭州市郊的东市公社，每张秋蚕蚕种平均产茧可达五十斤，杭州市郊的人民公社并出现了一些每张蚕种产茧百斤以上的高额丰产纪录。
    这是我国蚕丝产区公社化后的第一次夏秋蚕茧大丰收。今年各地人民公社充分发挥优越条件，大战今年夏秋之间的干旱、高温，实现了“秋蚕超春蚕”、“大灾大丰收”的要求。
    据新华社福州2日电　福建茶区秋茶大丰收。到10月25日止，全省已收购各类秋茶七万八千多担，比去年秋茶总收购量还多48％，超过今年春茶收购量一成多。福建秋茶大丰收，是各级党委加强领导，茶区人民公社社员在力争“秋茶超春茶，全年大丰收”的运动中，对茶园加强培植管理的结果。
    据新华社长沙2日电　湖南醴陵县王仙人民公社的两万九千八百多亩双季晚稻，经实打验收，平均亩产一千零二斤，比大跃进的去年增产八成，比今年早稻增产一倍多。有些生产队还出现了一些亩产两千斤以上的高产田。清潭大队有一丘田平均亩产高达二千三百二十五斤，庄埠大队文昌生产队有二亩零四厘田，平均亩产二千六百十七斤。
    据新华社呼和浩特2日电　内蒙古自治区杭锦后旗永胜人民公社的五千九百多亩春小麦，平均亩产五百一十二斤多，比去年增产一倍。永胜公社位于河套平原西部渠道的下游，北依阴山，地势低洼，土壤碱性很大。去年秋天公社化后，各族社员们认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”，在“碱土搬家”的口号下，把三千多亩土地上的盐碱土拉出去，把好土拉进田里，并且实行了深耕，分层施了混合肥，灌溉也比较好，还及时扑灭了黄疸病。因此，今年的春小麦长得格外茂密粗壮，籽粒饱满。
