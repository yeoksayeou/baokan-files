Commodity production base shows significant effect
Jiangxi wild plant and sideline food base provides large quantities of commodities
Hubei prepares to establish the first batch of agricultural, animal husbandry, fishery, and vegetable commodity bases

(Reported by this newspaper) Jiangxi Province is vigorously expanding its four-level commodity bases and comprehensively developing commodity production in mountainous areas, along the river and lake areas, and in the main production areas of historical famous products to ensure the supply of commodities to urban industrial and mining areas.

Commodity production bases in Jiangxi have become widespread throughout the province. In the past year or so, more than 2,000 commodity bases mainly engaged in the production of wild plants, local specialties, poultry, livestock, and sideline foods have been established. These bases have delivered more than 4,000 varieties of commodities to commercial departments, with a total output value of more than 60 million yuan.

Jiangxi has established four levels of commodity bases, from the province, special districts, and counties to the people's communes. There are three main types: one is the mountain reclamation farms established by agricultural reclamation departments and cadres who went to the mountains, developing the production of wild plants and local specialties; the second is developing vegetable and sideline food production around cities and industrial and mining areas; and the third is various experimental productions developed by commercial departments.

Jiangxi has many mountains and abundant resources. The reclamation farms established by agricultural reclamation departments and more than 50,000 cadres who went to the mountains on more than 200 large and small mountains are good bases for developing commodity production. In the past year or so, with the help of commercial departments, the production of commodities processed from wild plants in these bases has achieved unprecedented development. The collection of wild plants for winemaking alone has not only saved a lot of grain for the country, but also increased the supply of wine in the province's market by 58% compared with last year. In addition, the collection and processing of more than 1,000 kinds of local mountain products such as bamboo, wood, charcoal, paper, tea, dried bamboo shoots, animal skins, and feathers have greatly increased the volume of commodities, strongly supporting market supply and national construction. These reclamation farms are also actively developing livestock and poultry, fruit trees, and medicinal materials production, and have transferred more than 40,000 pigs and 1.56 million poultry.

Jiangxi has many rivers and lakes, which is very conducive to the development of fishery production. In the past year, more than 100 fish farming bases established around Poyang Lake and Ganjiang River have seen fish market volume reach 300,000 dan, an increase of nearly double compared with last year. The range of sugarcane production has expanded to more than ten counties, with an area expanded to 280,000 mu, and sugar production has reached 280,000 dan. The 300,000 dan of vegetables produced by vegetable bases in the suburbs of cities this year have ensured the supply for urban residents and factory and mine workers.

The experimental production carried out by commercial departments includes large-scale pig raising and the cultivation of various excellent varieties of animals and plants, and then imparting experience to various commodity bases to improve production technology.

(Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan) The Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to select some areas with suitable conditions as key areas for vigorously developing commodity production.

The first batch of agricultural (grain, cotton, oil) commodity bases initially determined by the Provincial Party Committee include 13 counties such as Wuhan suburbs, Jingmen, Sui County, and Mianyang, as well as all state-owned farms. Grain, cotton, and oil commodity bases are also bases for developing pig raising, because abundant grain can provide more concentrated feed, and more land can establish larger feed bases, making it possible to raise pigs in large quantities; and more pig raising can accumulate more fertilizer, which is more conducive to the development of grain, cotton, and oil production.

Regarding fish commodity bases, it is determined to focus on two cities (Wuhan, Huangshi), three lakes (Honghu Lake, Liangzi Lake, Chang Lake), and four counties (Xinzhou, Hanchuan, Hanyang, Sui County). Wuhan and Huangshi strive to achieve self-sufficiency in fish production in the next few years, and the three lakes and four counties mainly undertake the tasks of transferring and exporting fish products.

Five cities, Wuhan, Huangshi, Shashi, Yichang, and Xiangfan, as well as other small and medium-sized towns, will establish vegetable bases (and also establish pig raising bases) in the suburbs of each town to quickly achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables.

In terms of animal husbandry and local specialties, livestock production bases for cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, sheep, rabbits, etc., and various local specialty bases for tobacco leaves, tea, tung seeds, *mu* seeds, oil tea, raw lacquer, ramie, silk, wood ear, medicinal materials, fruits, and southern bamboo will also be established in mountainous areas such as western Hubei, northern Hubei, and eastern Hubei. The famous products of many other regions will also be included in the construction plan of commodity bases according to local conditions, providing more and better living consumer goods with a wide variety of colors and varieties.

At the same time, the Provincial Party Committee also put forward corresponding measures.

    商品生产基地作用显著
    江西野生植物和副食品基地提供大量商品
    湖北筹建第一批农牧渔和蔬菜等商品基地
    本报讯　江西省大力扩建四级商品基地，全面发展山区、沿江滨湖区和历史名产主要产地的商品生产，以保证城市工矿区的商品供应。
    江西商品生产基地已普及全省。一年多来，已建立的以野生植物、土特产和家禽家畜及副食品等生产为主的商品基地共达二千多个。这些基地已交售给商业部门各种商品有四千多个品种，总产值达六千多万元。
    江西从省、专区、县到人民公社建立了四级商品基地，主要类型有三种：一是农垦部门和上山干部兴建的山区垦殖场，发展野生植物和土特产的生产；二是在城市和工矿四周发展蔬菜和副食品生产；三是商业部门发展的各种实验性生产。
    江西山多，资源丰富，农垦部门和五万多上山干部在二百多个大小山头上建立的垦殖场，是发展商品生产的很好的基地。一年多来，这些基地在商业部门的帮助下，利用野生植物加工的商品生产得到了从来未有的发展。单采集野生植物酿酒一项，不但为国家节省了大量粮食，并使全省市场酒的供应量比去年增加了58％。此外，采集和加工竹、木、炭、纸、茶叶、笋干、兽皮、羽毛等一千多种土产山货，大大增加了商品量，有力地支援了市场供应和国家建设。这些垦殖场还积极发展家畜家禽和果木药材生产，已上调的猪达四万多头，家禽一百五十六万只。
    江西江河湖泊很多，极利于发展渔业生产。一年来，沿鄱阳湖和赣江四周建立的一百多个养鱼基地，鱼上市量达到了三十万担，比去年增加近一倍。甘蔗产地范围发展到十多县，面积扩大到二十八万亩，产糖量达二十八万担。城市郊区蔬菜基地今年所生产的三十万担蔬菜，保证了城市居民和厂矿职工的供应。
    商业部门进行的试验性生产，包括大量养猪、培育各种动植物优良品种，然后到各商品基地传授经验，提高生产技术。
    据新华社武汉讯　中共湖北省委决定选出一部分条件具备的地区，作为大力发展商品生产的重点。
    省委初步确定的第一批农业（粮、棉、油）商品基地，有武汉郊区和荆门、随县、沔阳等十三个县，以及所有的国营农场。粮棉油商品基地同时也是发展生猪的基地，因为粮食多可以提供较多的精饲料，土地多可以建立较大的饲料基地，有条件大量养猪；而多养猪又可以多积肥，更有利于发展粮棉油的生产。
    关于鱼的商品基地，确定以两市（武汉、黄石）、三湖（洪湖、梁子湖、长湖）、四县（新洲、汉川、汉阳、随县）为重点。武汉、黄石两市争取在最近几年内做到产鱼自给，三湖、四县主要担负鱼产品上调和出口的任务。
    武汉、黄石、沙市、宜昌、襄樊五个市以及其他中小城镇，将在各市镇的郊区建立蔬菜基地（同时也建立养猪基地），迅速做到蔬菜自给。
    在畜牧业和土特产方面，也将在鄂西、鄂北和鄂东等山区，建立牛、马、驴、骡、羊、兔等畜牧生产基地和烟叶、茶叶、桐子、木子、油茶、生漆、苎麻、蚕丝、木耳、药材、水果、南竹等各种土特产的基地。还有许多地区的名产也将因地制宜地列入商品基地的建设计划，提供更多更好、花色品种繁多的生活消费品商品。
    与此同时，省委还提出相应的措施。
