People's Daily Comprehensive News: Anhui, Sichuan, and Gansu provinces are strengthening field management of autumn-sown crops. As of the 5th of this month, these three provinces have completed sowing over 94 million mu of wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, etc. In Sichuan Province, early-sown rapeseed has grown to two chi (about 2/3 of a meter) high, and in Gansu Province, the wheat is a lush green. Currently, these three provinces are strengthening field management, adhering to the spirit of continuous revolution of "sow early, manage early; manage while sowing; manage immediately after sowing; never delay; never err," actively carrying out soil cultivation, weeding, pest control, topdressing, and winter irrigation to strive for "complete emergence this year, complete harvest next year."

    Sow Early, Manage Early, Manage While Sowing, Manage Immediately After Sowing, Never Delay, Never Err:
    Use the Spirit of Continuous Revolution to Manage Winter Wheat and Rapeseed Well
    Anhui, Sichuan, Gansu - Strive for Complete Emergence and Harvest on Nearly 100 Million Mu of Crops

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 11th: Anhui Province is universally carrying out work such as seedling inspection and replanting, topdressing, irrigation, and pest prevention for emerged winter wheat and rapeseed, and other autumn-sown crops.

As of November 5th, the province had sown over 48 million mu of crops such as wheat and rapeseed, accounting for 87% of the autumn sowing area. Early-sown wheat and rapeseed have generally emerged, and the seedlings are growing well. However, some fields have experienced seedling shortages due to severe drought at the time of sowing, and some fields have also experienced diseases and insect pests. People's communes throughout the province have recently arranged for a portion of the labor force to quickly launch a seedling inspection and replanting campaign. The United Brigade of the Laoqiao Commune in He County has 1,400 mu of rapeseed that was planted in a rush to combat drought. After a recent inspection, many fields were found to have no seedlings. In response to this situation, the brigade organized more than 270 laborers to launch a concentrated effort to draw water to moisten the fields, combined with applying liquid manure. Currently, rapeseed seedlings have generally emerged in the fields, presenting a lush green scene.

At the same time, people's communes throughout the province have organized field management professional teams to topdress, irrigate, and prevent pests for autumn-sown crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 11th: Sow early and manage early, sow well and manage well. Sichuan is arranging and carrying out field management of summer harvest crops in advance.

As of November 5th, various regions had sown over 44 million mu of summer harvest crops such as wheat, rapeseed, peas, and broad beans. Compared with the same period last year, not only has the quality improved, but the sowing progress and timing have also been greatly accelerated and advanced. The wheat sowing area in Fuling and Wanxian prefectures has completed more than 80% of the plan, and the rapeseed planting plan has been overfulfilled. The early-sown rapeseed in various regions has generally grown to two chi high, and the early-sown wheat and barley have also sprouted seedlings.

The rich harvest experience in various parts of Sichuan proves that managing immediately after sowing and managing while sowing have five major benefits: It can prepare for field management in terms of ideology, measures, and systems in advance; it can promptly discover problems and find ways to remedy them; it can complete some of the field management agricultural tasks in advance, which can avoid the phenomenon of various agricultural tasks crowding together in winter production; it is more timely and reasonable than managing all at once after all sowing is completed; and early management is also of great benefit to preventing crop lodging.

The establishment of people's communes has created favorable conditions for early management and good management. According to the conditions of abundant talent and strong strength, people's communes in various regions have drawn a portion of the labor force to establish professional management teams. Each time a plot is sown, it is handed over to the professional management team. Usually, these professional management personnel undertake some agricultural tasks that do not require much labor. When agricultural tasks requiring a large amount of labor arrive, the commune uniformly dispatches labor for concentrated efforts. This ensures the timely implementation of various management tasks such as thinning seedlings, replanting seedlings, and cultivating soil.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 11th: Gansu Province is strengthening winter wheat field management, striving for "complete seedling emergence this year and complete harvest next year" for over 2 million mu of winter wheat.

This year, Gansu's winter wheat was sown in a timely manner and sown well. Tianshui and Pingliang prefectures, the main winter wheat producing areas, were about half a month earlier in terms of sowing time and speed than last year. The vast majority of winter wheat is sown in deeply ploughed land. The base fertilizer applied per mu reached 5,800 jin (about 2900 kg). The rate of selected fine varieties reached more than 99%. The wheat has already developed tillers, divided into clumps, and taken root. The fields are already a lush green.

In terms of wheat field management, the province, adhering to the spirit of never delaying, never missing a single detail, and continuous revolution, has organized many seedling inspection and replanting professional teams to inspect each plot in the fields one by one and accept each seedling. Those with missing seedlings are replanted, and those with sparse seedlings are replanted to thicken them. After inspecting more than 3 million mu of winter wheat, Tianshui Prefecture found that more than 40,000 mu had a lack of seedlings, and immediately replanted more than 34,500 mu, with the remainder still being inspected and replanted. Zhenyuan, Qingyang, Ningxian, and other counties found that a small portion of winter wheat had developed rust and insect pests, and immediately demarcated areas and points to mobilize the masses to contract for prevention and control. The province is also combining water conservancy construction to vigorously carry out winter irrigation and fertilizer accumulation.

    本报综合消息　安徽、四川、甘肃三省，正在加强秋季播种作物的田间管理。到本月五日止，这三个省九千四百多万亩小麦、油菜、蚕豆等，都已种完，四川省早种的油菜长到两尺来高，甘肃省的小麦一片碧绿。目前，这三个省正在加强田间管理，他们本着早种早管，随种随管，一时不误，一着不差的不断革命精神，积极进行培土、除草、治虫、追肥和冬灌，争取“今年十成苗，明年十成收。”
    早种早管　边种边管　种下就管　一时不误　一着不差
    用不断革命精神管好冬麦油菜
    安徽  四川  甘肃  力争近亿亩作物十成苗十成收
    据新华社合肥11日电　安徽省各地对已出苗的小麦和油菜等秋种作物，普遍开展了查苗补苗、追肥、灌溉和防虫等工作。
    到11月5日止，全省已种小麦、油菜等作物四千八百多万亩，占秋种面积87％。早播种的小麦和油菜已普遍出苗，幼苗生长良好。但是少数田由于在播种时受到严重干旱，发生了缺苗现象，部分田里还发生了病虫害。全省各地人民公社最近都安排了一部分劳力，迅速开展了一个查苗补苗运动。和县姥桥公社联合大队有一千四百亩油菜都是抗旱抢种的，经过最近检查，有不少田没有出苗，针对这种情况，这个大队就组织二百七十多个劳力突击车水润田，结合追施水粪，目前油菜田已普遍长出幼苗，呈现一片葱绿。
    同时，全省人民公社都组织田间管理专业队，为秋种作物追肥、灌溉和防虫。
    据新华社成都11日电　早种早管，种好管好，四川各地提早布置和进行夏收作物的田间管理工作。
    各地到11月5日止已种下小麦、油菜、豌豆、蚕豆等夏收作物四千四百多万亩。跟去年同期比较，不但质量提高，播种进度和时间也大大加快和提前。涪陵、万县等专区的小麦播种面积已经完成计划80％以上，油菜定植计划已超额完成。各地早下种的油菜一般都长到两尺来高，早种的小麦、大麦也长出了幼苗。
    四川各地的丰产经验证明，种下就管、边种边管，有五大好处：可以从思想上、措施上、制度上提早为田间管理作好准备；能及时发现问题和设法补救；将一部分田间管理的农活提前做好，可以避免冬季生产中各种农活挤在一起的现象；比全部种完再一齐管理来得及时、合理；早管对防止作物倒伏也有很大好处。
    人民公社的建立，为早管和管好创造了有利条件。各地人民公社根据人材多力量强的条件，都抽出一部分劳动力建立专业管理队伍，每种完一块，便向专业管理队伍移交一块。平时，由这些专业管理人员担负一些用工不多的农活，当需工量较大的农活到来时，就由公社统一调度劳动力进行突击。这样，便保证了匀苗、补苗、培土等各项管理工作的及时进行。
    据新华社兰州11日电　甘肃省正在加强小麦田间管理，力争二百多万亩冬小麦“今年十成苗，明年十成收”。
    今年甘肃冬小麦种得适时，种得好。冬麦主要产区的天水和平凉专区，在播种的时间和速度上都比去年提前半个月左右。绝大部分冬麦都种在正槎的深翻地里。每亩施基肥达五千八百斤。精选良种达到99％以上。小麦已经倒了箭、分了股、扎了根，田野上已是一片葱绿。
    在麦田管理上，全省各地本着一时不误，一着不漏，不断革命的精神，组织了许多查苗补苗专业队，到田间逐块检查，逐苗验收，缺者补足，稀者补稠。天水专区对三百多万亩冬麦进行检查后，发现四万多亩有缺苗现象，立即补了三万四千五百多亩，其余的还在继续查补中。镇原、庆阳、宁县等发现一小部分冬麦发生锈病和虫害，立即划片分点，发动群众包干防治。全省还结合兴修水利，抓紧冬灌和积肥。
