    South African Women Persist in Struggle in Prison
    Editor's Note: South African "New Age" weekly published a message from Durban on October 22, interviewing Dr. M. M. Mkaidi, a leader of the African National Congress who was imprisoned. Excerpts are translated as follows:
    Dr. Mkaidi met with the "New Age" reporter alone outside the prison gate and said:
    "The spirit of the women in prison is great. I have never seen such stern determination and such a high degree of enthusiasm for the cause of liberation.
    "There has never been any sign of discouragement at any stage.
    "The women rejected any suggestion from their men to pay their fines. Five women were suddenly released one day, and they were surprised and angry. They said their men had disgraced them."
    When Dr. Mkaidi spoke about the mistreatment of women, she said that she and Mrs. Philida Shange, another prominent member of the African National Congress Women's League, were separated from others and treated particularly brutally. She said: "On the day we arrived at the women's prison, a guard thought we didn't understand African languages and said to another guard that they were going to break us down.
    "I smiled, because I decided to let him see who would be broken down first." Dr. Mkaidi said that her job in prison was breaking rocks.
    She said: "On the first day, to show the guards that we could do anything, we broke all the big rocks.
    "But the next day we refused to break any rocks. As a result, I was locked in a cell with very poor food."
    Mrs. Shange said that she filed a complaint with a court, and the judge found her not guilty.
    She said: "After that, we were treated better."
    Dr. Mkaidi asked to bring a message to the women, saying that the enemy is sparing no effort to "force people to submit."
    She said: "We must react quickly and organize quickly to fight back for the freedom and democracy of all the people in our motherland.
    "Men should not only join the National Congress, they should also actively participate in the struggles initiated by the National Congress. More importantly, men should not prevent their women from participating in the struggle.
    "The road to freedom is arduous. It is sometimes difficult and painful, but the cause is just, and there is no doubt that it is worth paying any sacrifice—even death—for its outcome.
    "My African brothers and sisters, all politically minded South Africans, I call on you to join this good struggle, the struggle for full freedom and democracy for all of South Africa.
    "Let all of us—black and white, Indian, European, colored, and African—join hands and move forward together to build a free South Africa without racial hatred."

### 南非妇女在监狱中坚持斗争

    南非妇女在监狱中坚持斗争
    编者按　南非“新世纪”周刊10月22日刊载了自德班发来的一条访问被监禁的非洲人国民大会领袖姆卡迪博士的消息，摘译如下：
    姆卡迪博士在监狱门外单独接见“新世纪”记者时说：
    “监狱中妇女们的精神是伟大的。我从来没有看见过这样严峻的决心和这种献身于解放事业的高度热情。
    “任何阶段都没有过垂头丧气的表示。
    “妇女们拒绝了她们的男人要给她们付罚金的任何建议。有五位妇女一天忽然获释了，她们感到意外和愤怒。她们说，她们的男人丢她们的脸。”
    姆卡迪博士在谈到对妇女的虐待时说，她和非洲人国民大会妇女联盟另一个著名成员菲利达·香吉夫人被同其他人隔开，受到特别粗暴的对待。她说：“在我们到达女监的那一天，一个看守人认为我们不懂非洲语，就对另一个看守人说，他们要瓦解我们。
    “我微笑了，因为我决定让他看看，到底谁将先被瓦解。”姆卡迪博士说，她在监狱的工作是敲石头。
    她说：“在第一天，为了让看守人看看我们什么都能作，我们敲碎了所有的大石头。
    “可是第二天我们拒绝敲任何石头。这样我就被关在一间伙食很不好的牢房里。”
    香吉夫人说，她向一个法院提出控告，法官认为她没有罪。
    她说：“在这之后我们受到较好的对待。”
    姆卡迪博士要求带一个口信给妇女，她说，敌人正在不惜余力地“迫使人们屈服。”
    她说：“我们必须赶快有所反应，为了我们祖国全体人民的自由和民主，我们将赶快组织起来给予回击。
    “男人们不仅应该参加国民大会，他们还应该积极参加国民大会发起的斗争。更重要的是，男人们不要阻止他们的女人参加斗争。
    “走向自由的大路是艰巨的。它有时是困难和痛苦的，可是这个事业是公正的，毫无疑问是值得为它的结果付出任何牺牲——甚至死。
    “我的非洲兄弟姐妹们，一切有政治思想的南非人，我号召你们参加这个良好的斗争，争取全南非得到充分的自由和民主的斗争。
    “让我们所有人——黑人和白人，印度人，欧洲人，有色人和非洲人，一起手拉手向前进，建设一个没有种族仇恨的自由南非。”
