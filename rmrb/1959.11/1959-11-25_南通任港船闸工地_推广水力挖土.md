    Nantong Rengang Ship Lock Construction Site
    Promotes Hydraulic Excavation
    (Our Dispatch) Inspired by the Yangtze River waves sweeping away mud and rock and hydraulic coal mining, workers at the Nantong City Rengang Ship Lock construction site successfully experimented with hydraulic excavation. Now, five hydraulic excavators have been put into production one after another.
    Hydraulic excavation uses high-pressure jet streams, through water guns, to cut the soil, dissolve the soil into slurry, and then use a mud pump to discharge it to the waste soil area. The main equipment for hydraulic excavation includes a high-pressure pump, mud pump, water gun, and the necessary inlet and outlet pipes and vessels for installing the equipment. The machinery can be powered by electricity, diesel engines, steam engines, etc. Rural areas lacking power can use existing drainage and irrigation equipment for modification.
    Hydraulic excavation has high efficiency, fast progress, low cost, saves labor, and has low labor intensity; it has far-reaching significance for accelerating water conservancy construction and supporting agricultural production. Due to the use of hydraulic excavation machinery in the Rengang Ship Lock construction project, the number of people participating in earthwork can be reduced by 93%, the construction period can be shortened by 45%, and the cost per cubic meter of earth is also reduced by two-thirds compared with manual excavation.
    Not long ago, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee held a hydraulic excavation exchange meeting in Nantong City, focusing on studying the widespread promotion of hydraulic excavation. (Attached picture)
    Look how fast hydraulic excavation is!

### 南通任港船闸工地  推广水力挖土

    南通任港船闸工地
    推广水力挖土
    本报讯　南通市任港船闸工地职工受到长江浪涛席卷泥石和水力采煤的启发，试用水力挖土成功。现在已经有五台水力挖土机先后投入生产。
    水力挖土，是用高压的急射水流，通过水枪冲切土壤，并将土壤溶成泥浆后，再用泥泵排往弃土地区。水力挖土的主要机具是高压泵、泥泵、水枪以及必要的进出水管和装置机具的船舶等。机械的发动，可以用电动的，也可以用柴油机、蒸汽机等，缺乏电源的农村，可以利用现有的排灌设备加以改装。
    水力挖土，工效高，进度快，成本低，劳力省，劳动强度低；对于加速水利建设、支持农业生产具有深远意义。任港船闸建闸工程由于使用了水力挖土机械，参加土方工程的人数可以减少93％，工期可以缩短45％，每方土的费用，也比人工挖土减少三分之二。
    不久前，江苏省委曾在南通市召开了水力挖土交流会议，着重研究了水力挖土的普遍推广问题。（附图片）
    看，水力挖土挖得多快。
