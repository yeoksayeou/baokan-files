Xinhua News Agency report: The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is strengthening the construction of grassland bases and the preparation for planting pasture grass in order to gradually change the situation of relying on natural wild grass to feed livestock for thousands of years.

Many arid grasslands cannot be fully utilized due to lack of water. Now, measures such as digging wells, building water cellars, irrigation ponds, and constructing small reservoirs are being taken to solve the problem of drinking water for people and livestock. For example, the Majia Dashan Grassland in Tongxin County has been covered with lush pasture for many years, but it has not been fully utilized due to the lack of water sources. This year, Tongxin County has conducted a survey and plan for this grassland, and is striving to build a small reservoir with a water storage capacity of 12,700 cubic meters on the grassland before the end of the year. Haiyuan and other counties have basically solved the drinking water difficulties of some communes this year because they have built 2,651 water cellars and many涝pools on the arid grasslands. In order to solve the problem of winter livestock fodder, many counties have planned a number of grasslands for delayed grazing and are removing poisonous weeds and eliminating wolf hazards on these grasslands.

In order to meet the requirements of the high-speed development of animal husbandry after communization, and to fundamentally solve the problem of fodder and feed for livestock, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region People's Committee have decided to rapidly establish three semi-mechanized grassland work stations in Yanchi, Tongxin, Jinji and other counties with relatively developed animal husbandry, more sheep, large grassland areas, and conditions for mountain floods to inundate the land. These will serve as bases for future grassland construction. Now, tractors are already reclaiming wasteland on the vast, calm grasslands.

Xinhua News Agency report: In the Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County on the Pamir Plateau, the net increase rate of livestock such as horses, cattle, camels, sheep, and goats reached 20% this year, and the county averages 9.6 head of livestock per person. At present, herdsmen of all ethnic groups are braving the plateau wind and snow to go deep into various pastures to check the pregnancy status of breeding females, re-examine and re-mate, and strive to ensure that all kinds of livestock in the county are fully mated and fully protected during pregnancy.

Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County in Xinjiang is a county mainly engaged in animal husbandry. Last year, it won a certificate of merit from the State Council because of the rapid development of agricultural and animal husbandry production. The Tashkurgan County Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized the experience created by the masses in the Great Leap Forward last year and summarized the high-speed development of animal husbandry production as "Ten Comprehensive" measures. These "Ten Comprehensive" measures are: all breeding females are fully mated; all mated females are pregnant; all pregnant females are fully protected during pregnancy; all newborn livestock survive; all livestock, large and small, are strong; sheep breeds are fully improved; prevent diseases, eliminate animal pests, and ensure the complete safety of livestock; sufficient feed; sufficient grass; all livestock have sheds for winter and spring. These measures have been widely discussed by farmers and herdsmen and implemented into daily production.

This year, all communes in the county have selected a group of herdsmen with rich grazing experience to form specialized animal husbandry teams; at the same time, they have also transferred a portion of the labor force to develop agricultural production. According to the distribution of pastures, the various animal husbandry professional teams divided the pastures, grazed in groups, and appropriately adjusted the ratio of breeding males to females. In May of this year, the Pamir Plateau experienced a heavy snowfall rarely seen in decades, but livestock deaths were greatly reduced.

As a result, the average survival rate of the 27,552 lambs born in the spring reached 90%; the survival rate of the 5,299 large livestock births also exceeded 93%.

In order to open up more feed bases and pastures for livestock, farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups have built small-scale water conservancy projects to expand irrigation by more than 20,000 mu of grassland, and at the same time increased the planting area of ​​grain feed by more than 5,000 mu. At present, the amount of pasture stored in the county has increased by more than 40% compared with last year. In order to increase the number of livestock and improve the quality of livestock, the autonomous county began intensive breeding of sheep this year and vigorously promoted the local Dambash large-tailed sheep. This type of sheep produces twice as much meat and wool as other local sheep. This year, the proportion of local sheep improved by artificial insemination and hybridization accounted for 40% of all breeding ewes.

    适应公社高速发展牲畜的需要
    宁夏加紧草原基地建设
    新疆塔吉克族自治县采取“十全”措施发展畜牧生产
    据新华社讯  宁夏回族自治区加强草原基地的建设和牧草种植的准备工作，以逐步改变千百年来依靠天然野草饲养牲畜的状况。
    许多干旱草原由于缺水，不能充分利用，现在采取挖水井、修水窖、浇池和修小水库等办法，解决人畜饮水问题。如同心县马家大山草原，多少年来虽然生长着茂密的牧草，但是因为缺少水源，一直没有充分利用。今年同心县已对这个草原进行了调查、规划，力争在年底以前在草原上修成一座能蓄水一万二千七百立方米的小水库。海原等县今年由于在干旱草原上修筑了二千六百五十一个水窖和许多涝池，已经基本上解决了一些公社的人畜饮水困难。许多县为了解决冬季牲畜饲草问题，规划出了一批延迟放牧的草原，并且在这些草原上除毒草和消灭狼害。
    为了适应公社化后畜牧业高速度发展的要求，并从根本上解决牲畜的饲草、饲料问题，中共宁夏回族自治区委员会和宁夏回族自治区人民委员会已决定在畜牧业较发达、羊只较多、草原面积较大、有山洪漫地条件的盐池、同心、金积等县，迅速建立三处半机械化草原工作站，作为今后建设草原的基地。现在，辽阔、平静的草原上已有拖拉机在开垦荒地。
    据新华社讯　帕米尔高原上的塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县，今年马、牛、骆驼、绵羊、山羊等家畜净增率达到20％，全县平均每人已有牲畜九点六头。目前各族牧民正冒着高原风雪，深入各牧场检查适龄母畜怀胎情况，复查复配，力争全县各种家畜全配满怀和全部保胎。
    塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县是新疆一个以畜牧业为主的县份。去年因为农牧业生产发展很快，曾经获得国务院的奖状。中共塔什库尔干县委员会根据去年大跃进中群众创造的经验，把高速度发展畜牧业生产总结为“十全”措施。这“十全”是：适龄母畜全配；配种母畜全怀；怀胎母畜全部保胎；接产幼畜全部成活；大小牲畜全壮；绵羊品种全部改良；防止病害、消灭兽害、保证牲畜全部安全；料全；草全；牲畜过冬度春全部有棚圈。这些措施经过农牧民广泛讨论，贯彻到了日常生产中去。
    全县各公社今年都抽出一部分富有放牧经验的牧民，组成畜牧业专业队；同时也抽调一部分劳动力发展农业生产。各畜牧业专业队根据牧场分布状况，划分牧场，分群牧放，种公畜与母畜的比例也进行了适当的调剂。今年5月，帕米尔高原连降几十年少有的大雪，但牲畜的死亡大大减少。
    这样，春天产的二万七千五百五十二只羔羊，成活率平均达到90％；大畜产仔五千二百九十九头，成活率也在93％以上。
    为了给牲畜多开辟饲料基地和草场，各族农牧民兴修小型水利扩大灌溉了两万多亩草场，同时增加了粮食饲料播种面积五千多亩。目前全县储存的牧草已比去年增加40％以上。为了增加牲畜头数和提高牲畜的品质，这个自治县今年开始了羊只的密集繁殖工作，并且大量推广当地当巴什的大尾羊。这种羊比当地其他绵羊产肉量和产毛量高出一倍。今年采用人工授精和杂交的办法改良的土种羊，占全部适龄母羊的40％。
