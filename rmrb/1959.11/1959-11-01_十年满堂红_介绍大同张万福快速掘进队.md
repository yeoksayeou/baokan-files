Ten Years of Complete Success
—Introducing the Datong Zhang Wanfu Rapid Tunneling Team
    The Zhang Wanfu Rapid Tunneling Team of Yongdingzhuang Mine under the Datong Mining Bureau of Shanxi Province is a red banner team that is constantly leaping forward. Since its establishment at the end of 1949, it has overfulfilled the state plan every year. This year, it overfulfilled the state plan for January to September twenty-three days ahead of schedule. Over the past ten years, it has maintained safe production, and the specifications and quality have all met national requirements. From 1952 to the present, it has been rated as an advanced unit in the province and city for seven consecutive years. In 1953, it attended the North China Regional Labor Model Conference, and in 1956, it attended the National Coal Mine Advanced Producers and National Advanced Producers Representative Conference. In the second quarter of this year, it was rated as a pacesetter team in Shanxi Province.

    Skillful Work to Overcome Key Problems, Practical Work to Break Through Difficulties
    The glorious history of the Zhang Wanfu team is a history of continuous struggle against difficulties and continuous technological innovation. They have consistently relied on the masses, united with technical personnel, and vigorously carried out technological innovations to promote advanced experiences, aiming at the key production problems to promote the continuous leap forward in production. As early as March 1954, the tunneling of No. 6 well could not keep up with the needs of mining, and the production situation was not good. At this time, the leadership required them to speed up the progress. The first step in tunneling was how to improve drilling technology and improve blasting rate. At that time, it was said that the experience of the "parallel crack" blasting method in Jingxi Coal Mine was very good, so they sent people to Jingxi Coal Mine to "learn the scriptures"; however, due to different coal quality and other conditions, several trials failed. Zhang Wanfu took the initiative to repeatedly study and experiment with technicians and veteran workers, and finally created a method of using secondary slotting deep-hole blasting, which greatly improved the blasting rate and accelerated the progress, making the progress of each round of blasting from 1.4 to 1.5 meters, increased to 2.1 to 2.3 meters, so that the monthly progress increased from more than 300 meters to 700 meters to 800 meters. This method was named "Relay Slotting Method" and was promoted to all coal mines in the province.

    As tunneling accelerated, new problems arose: transportation could not keep up. In the past, they used two people to push a cart from the work surface all the way to the main roadway, with a general distance of about 600 meters or more. With flat road transportation, they had to send the heavy coal cart out before they could return the light cart, which was both laborious and inefficient. Later, after everyone's research, with the help of technical personnel, the "segmented relay transportation method" was created, which greatly accelerated the transportation speed, shortening the pushing time of each round of blasting from one hour and thirty-six minutes to about one hour, increasing the efficiency by one-third, and greatly reducing the labor intensity of the workers. This solved the problem of imbalance between transportation and tunneling. This method has formed a system, and they have adhered to it from 1954 to the present.

    In June of this year, in the high-yield campaign to create a thousand-meter record as a gift to "July 1st," the first difficulty encountered was hard coal quality and many rock interlayers. In the first eight days, less than 200 meters were advanced. How to break through this difficulty? Veteran driller Zhao Lu repeatedly studied with everyone, and finally found a way to use a 1.6-meter short drill to drill stone edges, and then use a long drill to put into deep holes, and implement "offset slotting," first drilling coal, then drilling stones, breaking through the difficulty of deep-hole blasting drilling. Then, the problem encountered was the large amount of water, and the gunpowder loaded into the deep holes was often washed out by water, and it still could not operate normally. The captain Zhang Wanfu held another "Zhuge Liang meeting." With the help of the Party branch, the method of using thick paper tubes to hold the explosives was adopted, which solved this problem, and increased the progress of each round of blasting from 1.4 meters to 2.2 meters, creating a new record of advancing one thousand and seventy-eight point three meters per month in a double-hole operation.

    With this spirit of hard work, the Zhang Wanfu team has created more than 20 important advanced experiences in recent years, such as "Relay Slotting," "Three-Point Self-Extension Line," and "Snake Shedding Skin Shift Change," and promoted hundreds of other advanced experiences, which played a decisive role in overfulfilling the leaping forward plan.

    Detailed Management, Strict System, Well-Organized
    Detailed management, strict system, and high democratic style are also the main characteristics of the Zhang Wanfu team. Their monthly and quarterly work plans are discussed by the masses, and the various indicators are specifically allocated to each small team. The measures to guarantee the realization of the plan are set out for each type of work, and then the execution is announced in the form of big-character posters. In the process of execution, in addition to the team holding a team affairs meeting every ten days to check and balance the execution of the plan, it also adheres to checking by shift, by day, and by ten days through various forms of meetings, and solves problems in a timely manner. In this way, the realization of the plan and measures is built on the foundation of the masses. In the team, the management work related to planning, cost, technology, safety, personnel, and life are all divided into responsibilities, so that everyone participates in the management. This greatly inspires and improves the workers' sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs and expands democratic life.

    Over the past few years, this team has gradually explored a relatively complete set of management experiences, and has made it a system, strictly implemented it, and persisted in it unremittingly. For example: in 1953, there was no fixed system for shift handover, the responsibility was unclear, the work was chaotic, and the production was seriously affected. In response to this problem, they repeatedly studied and experimented, and created a "snake shedding skin" shift handover method. This method is: the incoming team leader contacts the outgoing team leader in advance by telephone to inform them of the production situation in the well, and arranges the work and location of each person on the ground before going down the well. In this way, production does not stop during the shift handover, so that the labor time utilization rate is close to 100%. They have gradually established eight relatively sound management systems. In addition to the above-mentioned "snake shedding skin" shift handover system and "segmented relay transportation system," there are also "shift acceptance system," "team cost accounting system," "wage scoring system," "team affairs meeting system," "competition reward system," and "mutual assistance fund system."

    Due to the conscientious adherence to the above systems, the production order is orderly, the production management is greatly strengthened, and the completion of production tasks is effectively guaranteed.

    One Person, Many Skills
    In the past, the Datong Coal Mine implemented piecework by type of work, one-sidedly emphasizing technical specialization and technical standards divorced from politics, which to some extent caused non-cooperation, idling, and waste between shifts, between construction sites, and between direct workers and auxiliary workers. Some people fostered bourgeois individualism, the labor time utilization rate was very low, and labor productivity could not be improved quickly. Unreasonable wages accounted for about 30%, which seriously affected the development of production. In May 1958, the Zhang Wanfu team took the lead in boldly reforming the labor organization, implementing a comprehensive work team, comprehensive operation, changing piecework by type of work to the original team comprehensive piecework, flexible evaluation of fixed grades, and promoting new forms of workers participating in management, thereby more thoroughly reforming the labor organization, greatly strengthening cooperation between shifts and types of work, and strengthening the workers' collectivist ideology. This changed the phenomenon of excessively detailed and rigid division of labor, and combined technology with politics. All the veteran workers in this team have now basically become all-rounders, who can both drill holes and set off explosives, load coal and push carts; can also support pillars and set up sheds, and also nail roads and operate winches. After the implementation of the comprehensive work team, the number of personnel in the entire team was reduced from more than 70 in the past to 54, a reduction of 24%, while the progress increased by 27% compared with the past, the efficiency per worker increased by 20%, and the democratic management was expanded, further improving the level of grass-roots management and promoting the great leap forward in production.

    Politics in Command, Unity and Mutual Assistance
    Under the cultivation and education of the Party, the Zhang Wanfu team has greatly improved its class consciousness through a series of political movements, especially the mass rectification and the study of the general line. "Listening to the Party's words and following the Party is sure to be right." This is a truth they have deeply realized from their personal experiences. Wherever the Party points, they work there. Every instruction, resolution, and call of the Party is a huge driving force for their continuous leap forward. After the general line was announced last year, they threw themselves into the ranks of the Great Leap Forward with a fighting attitude and overfulfilled the 1958 production plan. After the communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were transmitted to this team, they immediately organized discussions, revised the indicators, set out effective measures, and mustered greater efforts. The tunneling speed was rapidly increased, and the third quarter production plan was completed in twenty-two days.

    In-depth and meticulous political and ideological work is a distinct characteristic of this team. They often launch criticisms and self-criticisms against all kinds of conservative and backward ideas, patiently persuade and educate, and help comrades improve their thinking and correct their mistakes. In the first quarter of this year, in order to ensure the connection of the working face, No. 6 well needed to accelerate the tunneling progress of the two working faces of the Si Ling Yi Xia Shuncao. The task requirement was more than doubled that of another team, and the piece rate unit price was also 12% lower, and the conditions there were very difficult: the coal seam was low, the bottom plate was uneven, there was a lot of water, there were rock interlayers, and the transportation was far. After the Zhang Wanfu team accepted this task, some people at the beginning couldn't understand it, thinking that the leadership was just giving them difficult jobs. In response to these ideological situations, the team leaders held several group debate meetings in succession, and launched a heated debate on the erroneous ideas of those who were afraid of difficulties and retreated, thereby clarifying that "an advanced team should be a pioneer in overcoming difficulties" and "overcoming difficulties and completing tasks is the greatest glory." They strengthened their confidence and mustered their efforts. In difficult times, the captain, Communist Party member Zhang Wanfu, worked and commanded continuously for three shifts day and night. The transportation was far and the labor force was insufficient, so the 49-year-old veteran worker and Communist Party member Zhao Lu took the lead in not taking a break. Under their leadership, the workers of the three shifts united as one and twisted into a rope, and finally overcame all difficulties and completed the task fifteen days ahead of schedule.

    The mutual care between comrades in this team in life is also meticulous. For example, the driller Liu Yong originally lived in an earth kiln that was old and dilapidated. Because the mine lacked housing, he could not move temporarily. Whenever it rained, he would repair the house, which affected his work. After the team discovered this problem, Comrade Zhang Wanfu took the initiative to give him his outer room to live in, so Lao Liu no longer missed work when it rained again.

    Encouraged by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all the workers of the Zhang Wanfu team are now mustering greater efforts, further innovating technology, mechanizing transportation, trying out 3.2-meter-long drills to set up holes and blasting, and striving to resolutely achieve an annual advance of ten thousand meters and complete the annual state plan ahead of schedule.

    十年满堂红
    ——介绍大同张万福快速掘进队
    山西省大同矿务局永定庄矿张万福快速掘进队是一个不断跃进的红旗队。从1949年底建队以来，年年超额完成国家计划。今年又提前二十三天超额完成了1到9月份国家计划。十年来，安全生产，规格质量全部符合国家要求。从1952年到现在连续七年都被评为省、市先进单位，并在1953年出席华北地区劳模大会，1956年出席全国煤矿先进生产者和全国先进生产者代表会议，今年第二季度被评为山西省标兵队。
    巧干攻关键  实干破难关
    张万福队的光荣历史，就是不断向困难斗争，不断革新技术的历史。他们一贯依靠群众，团结技术人员，针对生产关键问题，大力开展技术革新，推广先进经验，推动生产不断跃进。早在1954年3月，六号井掘进赶不上回采需要，生产情况不好，这时，领导上要求他们加快进度。掘进的第一个环节就是如何改进打眼技术，提高爆破率。当时听说京西煤矿的“平行龟裂”爆破法的经验很好，于是他们就派人到京西煤矿“取经”；但由于煤质等情况不同，试行几次都失败了。张万福就主动同技术员、老工人反复研究试验，终于创造出用二次掏槽深孔爆破的方法，大大提高了爆破率，加快了进度，使每茬炮的进度由一点四到一点五米，提高到二点一到二点三米，使月进度由三百多米提高到七百米至八百米。这个办法被命名为“接力掏槽法”，曾推广到全省各个煤矿。
    掘进加快了，新的问题出现了：运输赶不上去。过去他们是用两个人推一个车，从工作面一直往大巷送，一般距离约在六百米以上，平道运输，每次要把重煤车送出去以后才能把轻车返回来，既费劲，效率又低。后来经过大家研究，在技术人员的帮助下，创造出“分段接力运输法”，就大大加快了运输速度，使每茬炮的推车时间由一小时三十六分缩短到一小时左右，效率提高了三分之一，还大大减轻了工人的劳动强度。这样就解决了运输和掘进不平衡的问题。这个办法形成了制度，他们从1954年一直坚持到现在。
    今年6月份在创造千米纪录向“七一”献礼的高产运动中，遇到头一个难关就是煤质硬、夹石多，头八天进了不到二百米。如何突破这个难关呢？老打眼工赵禄就同大家反复研究，终于找到了用一点六米短钎子打石楞，再用长钎子套进去打深眼，实行“偏掏槽”，先打煤、后打石头的办法，突破了深孔爆破打眼的难关。接着遇到的问题是水大，深孔里的火药装进去常被水冲出来，还是不能正常作业。大队长张万福又召开“诸葛亮会议”，在党支部的帮助下，采用厚纸筒装炮的办法，解决了这个问题，把每茬炮的进度由一点四米提高到二点二米，创造了双孔月进一千零七十八点三米的新纪录。
    张万福队就是以这种刻苦钻研的精神，几年来共创造了“接力掏槽”“三点自行延线”“蛇脱皮交接班”等二十多项重要的先进经验，并推广了数以百计的其他各种先进经验，对超额完成跃进计划起到了决定性的作用。
    管理细制度严井井有条
    管理细，制度严，民主风尚高，也是张万福队的主要特点。他们每月每季的作业计划都经过群众讨论，把各项指标具体分配到各小班，分工种定出实现计划的保证措施，然后用大字报公布执行。在执行过程中，除大队每旬召开一次队务会议，检查和平衡执行计划情况以外，还通过各种会议形式，坚持按班、按日、按旬检查，发现问题，及时解决。这样就使计划和措施的实现，建筑在群众基础上。大队里对有关计划、成本、技术、安全、人事、生活等管理工作，都分工负责，做到了个个参加管理。这大大启发与提高了工人当家作主的责任感，扩大了民主生活。
    这个队几年来，逐步地摸索出一套比较完整的管理经验，并使之形成制度，严格执行，坚持不懈。例如：在1953年交接班没有一定的制度，责任不明，工作混乱，严重地影响着生产。他们就针对这个问题，经过反复研究和试验，创造出“蛇脱皮”的交接班办法。这个办法是：接班组长事前用电话同交班组长联系好井下的生产情况，在井上就把每个人的工作和地点分配好，然后下井。这样，在交接班时也不停止生产，使工时利用率接近百分之百。他们逐步建立了八项比较健全的管理制度。除上述的“蛇脱皮”交接班制和“分段接力运输制”以外，还有“分班验收制”、“班组成本核算制”、“工资记分制”、“队务会议制”、“竞赛奖励制”和“互助基金制”。
    由于认真坚持了以上制度，使生产秩序有条不紊，大大加强了生产管理，有力地保证了生产任务的完成。
    一人多艺
    大同煤矿过去执行的分工种计件，片面地强调技术专业化，以及脱离政治的技术标准，在某种程度上造成了班次之间、工地之间、直接工与辅助工之间互不协作、窝工浪费等现象。有人滋长着资产阶级个人主义思想，工时利用率很低，劳动生产率不能很快提高。不合理的工资约占30％上下，严重地影响着生产的发展。张万福队在1958年5月就带头大胆改革劳动组织，实行综合工作队，综合作业，把分工种计件改为原班综合计件，死级活评，推行了工人参加管理的新形式，从而比较彻底地改革了劳动组织，大大加强了班次之间、工种之间的协作，加强了工人的集体主义思想。这就改变了分工过细过死的现象，把技术同政治结合起来。这个队现在所有的老工人基本上都成了多面手，既会打眼放炮，又会装煤推车；既会支柱架棚，也会钉道开绞车。实行综合工作队后，全队人员由过去的七十多人精减为五十四人，减少了24％，而进度比过去提高了27％，每工效率提高了20％，并扩大了民主管理，进一步提高了基层管理水平，促进了生产大跃进。
    政治挂帅　团结互助
    张万福队在党的培养教育下，经过一系列的政治运动，尤其是全民整风和学习总路线，大大提高了阶级觉悟。“听党的话，跟着党走，保险没错”，这是他们从切身的经历中深深认识到的一条真理。党指到哪里，他们就干到哪里，党的每个指示、决议和号召，都是他们不断跃进的巨大动力。去年总路线公布以后，他们就以战斗的姿态投入了大跃进的行列，超额完成了1958年的生产计划。今年党的八届八中全会公报和决议传到这个队以后，他们就立即组织讨论，修订了指标，订出了有效措施，鼓足更大干劲，掘进速度迅速提高，二十二天完成了第三季度生产计划。
    深入细致的政治思想工作，是这个队的鲜明特色。他们对各色各样的保守、落后思想，经常展开批评和自我批评，耐心说服教育，帮助同志提高思想，改正错误。今年第一季度六号井为保证掌子面的衔接，需要加快四○一下顺槽两个工作面的掘进进度，任务要求比另一队提高一倍以上，计件单价还要低12％，而那里的条件很困难：煤层低，底板不平，水大，有夹石，运输又远。张万福队接受这个任务以后，开始有些人想不通，认为领导专把难活给他们做。队领导就针对这些思想情况，连续召开了几次小组辩论会，对那些畏难而退的错误思想，展开了热烈辩论，从而明确了“先进队应当是克服困难的先锋”，“战胜困难，完成任务，才是最大光荣”。他们坚定了信心，鼓足了干劲。在困难的时刻，大队长、共产党员张万福不分昼夜三个班连续地工作和指挥。运输远了，劳动力不足，四十九岁的老工人、共产党员赵禄就带头不公休。在他们的带动下，三个班的工人团结一致，拧成一股劲，使进度由每小班进一到二个循环，提高到三到四个循环，终于克服一切困难，提前十五天完成了任务。
    这个队同志之间在生活上的相互关怀，也是无微不至的。如打眼工刘永原来住的是一间土窑，年久失修，由于矿上缺房，暂时搬不了家，每逢阴雨天，他就修房子，影响上班。队里发现这个问题后，张万福同志就主动把自己的外间屋让给他住，这样再下雨老刘也不误工了。
    张万福队的全体工人，在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，现在正鼓足更大干劲，进一步革新技术，要使运输机械化，试用三点二米长钎子架孔爆破，为坚决实现年进万米，提前完成全年国家计划而奋勇前进。
