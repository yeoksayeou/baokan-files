The Financial Work in the Last Ten Years
Cao Juru, President of the People’s Bank of China

In the past ten years since the founding of the great People’s Republic of China, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, historic and great victories have been achieved in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Now the people of the whole country are full of spirit and high morale, celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country with even greater leap forward achievements from all fronts. For the past ten years, China’s financial work has always revolved around the central tasks of the Party and the state at various periods, serving the Party’s general line, playing an active role in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and achieving significant accomplishments.

Established an independent, unified, and stable monetary system and a socialist financial system

Old China, under the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionary regime, deeply manifested the semi-feudal and semi-colonial nature of its financial system. On the eve of liberation, the financial market in the areas ruled by the Kuomintang was in an extremely chaotic situation: the pseudo-legal currency depreciated sharply, and prices soared wildly; gold, silver, and foreign currencies flooded the market, becoming the main objects of financial speculation; bureaucratic capital banks, imperialist banks, and private banks and money shops became the core of market speculation; imperialist banks opened in China not only arbitrarily issued currency, but also monopolized China’s international clearing and manipulated China’s foreign exchange prices, enslaving and exploiting the Chinese people. This situation caused even more serious damage to the dilapidated national economy, and brought great hardship and insecurity to the lives of the broad masses of working people. After the nationwide liberation, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the circulation of counterfeit currency, foreign currency, gold and silver was quickly and thoroughly eliminated, financial speculation was strictly prohibited, bureaucratic capital banks were confiscated, all privileges of imperialist banks were destroyed, and an independent, unified monetary system and a socialist financial system were established.

In the early days of the People’s Republic of China, in order to stabilize the financial market and prices, and create favorable conditions for the rapid recovery of the national economy, the Party and the government promulgated the "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work" in March 1950. With the efforts of the people throughout the country, the balance of financial revenue and expenditure, the balance of material allocation, and the balance of cash revenue and expenditure were quickly realized in a few months. In implementing this decision, the People’s Bank of China resolutely implemented the cash management method, concentrating a large amount of cash scattered in enterprises, institutions, organizations, and troops across the country into the bank, and using the concentrated funds to support state-owned commercial enterprises in controlling materials and strengthening the material strength of the state-owned economy in leading the market, effectively combating market speculation. In the implementation of this decision, the bank also quickly established a nationwide remittance network, facilitating the unified allocation and centralized use of state funds. Thus, with the victorious realization of the financial and material balance, the financial market and prices were quickly stabilized, fundamentally reversing the twelve-year-long inflation and soaring prices caused by reactionary rule. This brilliant victory on the financial and economic front marked the beginning of an improvement in China’s financial and economic situation, creating favorable conditions for the recovery and development of the national economy. When the country was just liberated, enemies at home and abroad asserted that the Communist Party had won militarily and politically, but that the difficulties in financial and economic work could not be overcome. But what were the facts? The facts loudly refuted the enemy’s lies. The Chinese people fought a very beautiful battle on the financial and economic front in a short period of time after the founding of the country.

In March 1955, due to the continuous development of production, the long-term stability of prices, and the general public's request to change the accounting unit of the Renminbi to make market transactions more convenient, the Party Central Committee and the State Council decided to issue a new Renminbi to exchange the old currency with the new currency. The exchange rate was one yuan of the new Renminbi for ten thousand yuan of the old Renminbi. The state stipulated that those who hold Renminbi, regardless of class or stratum, can exchange one yuan of the new currency for ten thousand yuan of the old currency. After people exchanged for the new currency, one yuan of the new currency can buy materials equivalent to ten thousand yuan of the old currency in the market. The issuance of the new Renminbi greatly facilitated transactions and accounting. Since then, China’s monetary system has become even more sound and consolidated.

Taking the price in March 1950 as 100, the national wholesale price index at the end of 1958 was 92.7%, and the retail price index of the eight major cities was 101.4, which proves that the value of the Renminbi has been stable for a long time.

The long-term stability of the Renminbi is the inevitable product of the socialist system, and it is the result of planned adjustment of currency circulation based on the rapid development of production under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line.

For ten years, the state's finances have not only guaranteed a balance of revenue and expenditure, but also often had a certain surplus as a reserve force for the country; the state issues currency through the credit channels of the bank, and releases or withdraws currency accordingly based on the development of production, the expansion of commodity circulation, and seasonal changes in the market; when the state arranges the national economic plan, it often makes the growth of consumer goods production and supply compatible with the growth of people's purchasing power, so as to avoid the phenomenon of too much or too little currency in the market and ensure the normal circulation of currency.

During the period of the Great Leap Forward, the right-wing elements once said that our Renminbi was unstable. Now, facts prove that, contrary to their slander, China’s Renminbi, like the currencies of other socialist countries, is one of the most stable currencies in the world. All capitalist so-called powerful countries, including American imperialism, are destined to have inevitable inflation. In fact, starting with the U.S. dollar, the currencies of many capitalist countries are constantly depreciating. Isn't this a powerful proof that the socialist system is superior to the capitalist system, and that the East wind prevails over the West wind?

During the economic recovery period, in accordance with the Party’s policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, the bank, on the one hand, implemented strict administrative management of private banks and money shops, restricting their speculative activities; on the other hand, under the leadership of the state bank, channeled their funds to be used for legitimate industrial and commercial lending; and gradually organized them to jointly lend and jointly operate businesses. During the "Five-Anti" movement, private banks and money shops were exposed to a large number of illegal speculative activities. The false prosperity of the market caused by illegal speculative activities on which they depended for survival no longer existed. Their role in absorbing floating capital and adjusting funds in the society was shrinking day by day, while at the same time, the leadership role of the People’s Bank of China in the financial market was strengthened day by day. Taking the absorption of savings and private industrial and commercial deposits as an example: from June 1950 to December 1952, in two and a half years, the proportion of state banks increased from 58.6% to 92.8%, and the proportion of private banks and money shops decreased from 41.4% to 7.2%. Private banks and money shops generally suffered losses and had operating difficulties during this period, making it difficult to continue to exist. Adapting to this situation, the state implemented the joint state-private ownership of all private banks and money shops in December 1952, forming joint state-private banks that operated under the leadership of the People’s Bank of China, thereby basically completing the socialist transformation of the private financial industry, ending the capitalist financial business in China, and building a unified socialist financial system, and providing favorable conditions for the state to further carry out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

Supporting socialist industrialization and socialist transformation

Entering the period of planned construction, the country's industrial production continued to expand. During the first five-year plan period, the total industrial (including handicraft) output value increased by 1.28 times. More than 10,000 new and expanded enterprises were built, including 537 construction units above the limited amount that were fully or partially put into production. In addition to the state's allocation of a certain quota of working capital, the bank is responsible for loans to support the seasonal and temporary capital needs required for industrial production. During this period, the bank's industrial loans increased by 2.3 times, meeting the seasonal and temporary working capital needs of state-owned industries. Among these loans, loans to heavy industry accounted for more than 50%, implementing the state's policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry.

During this period, state-owned and cooperative commercial enterprises not only served urban and rural material exchanges, production and people's consumption, but also undertook the task of carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. In order to support the continuous expansion of state-owned and cooperative commercial enterprises and support the capital needs of socialist commerce to carry out processing, ordering, unified purchase and exclusive sales of capitalist industry and commerce, state-owned commercial loans increased by more than two times in the five years from 1953 to 1957. State-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative commercial enterprises also undertake the task of purchasing agricultural products. The bank adopted the policy of fully supplying funds according to actual needs for the purchase of agricultural products, ensuring the capital needs of state-owned commercial enterprises to complete the purchase of major agricultural products such as grain and cotton. That is, how much merchandise is purchased, how much capital is supplied, where the merchandise is purchased, where the capital is supplied, and when the purchase is made, when the capital is supplied, which has effectively supported the completion of the task of purchasing agricultural products.

In order to thoroughly complete the task of the democratic revolution, the state, after the founding of the country, carried out the great land reform movement throughout the country. After three years, about 300 million poor peasants were allocated about 700 million mu of land and other large amounts of means of production, thereby completely destroying the feudal land ownership system that cruelly exploited peasants for thousands of years. After the poor peasants were allocated land, they still needed necessary support from the state in terms of funds in order to enable them to have the conditions for production, stabilize their lives, and concentrate on production. The Party decided at this time to provide loan support to poor peasants. From 1950 to 1952, the bank increased agricultural loans by 420 million yuan according to the instructions of the Party, of which 70%-80% was lent to poor peasants after they were allocated land.

Then, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the nation's peasants advanced towards the road of organizing and gradually realizing agricultural cooperation. Starting in 1953, after the stage of mutual assistance and cooperation, in the autumn of 1955, a high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture was launched throughout the country. By the end of 1956, 96% of the nation's households had organized more than 750,000 agricultural cooperatives, and the vast majority had joined advanced cooperatives. During this period, the bank's agricultural loans mainly promoted and helped agricultural cooperation, and at the same time, it also gave enthusiastic care to the capital difficulties of individual peasants. From 1953 to 1956, agricultural loans increased by 2.6 billion yuan. In the high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture in 1956 alone, loans increased by 2.03 billion yuan. This includes 700 million yuan of poverty alleviation cooperative fund loans. This poverty alleviation cooperative fund helped about 40 million poor households solve the difficulty of joining cooperative funds. In the high tide of agricultural cooperation, the issuance of these loans played an active role in consolidating the dominant position of poor peasants in agricultural cooperatives and in strengthening the unity between poor and middle peasants.

According to the Party's instructions on developing agricultural production cooperation, credit cooperatives were also developed in rural areas. In 1953, there were 9,418 rural credit cooperatives. By the end of 1955, basically every township had a cooperative. About 76 million households joined the cooperatives. Together with the grassroots institutions of the state bank, the credit cooperatives organized mass funds, combated usury, solved the difficulties of poor and lower-middle peasants in production and life, and promoted the development of the agricultural mutual assistance and cooperation movement.

In the high tide of socialist transformation, the bank gave loan support to handicraft cooperatives to solve their capital needs for expanding production after the transformation. In 1956 alone, loans to handicraft cooperatives increased three times. In the high tide of joint state-private ownership of all capitalist industries, loans to joint ventures increased by 5.8 times, replenishing their working capital for expanding production and operation after the joint venture.

Implementing the general line of socialist construction, supporting the great leap forward in production and the people's commune movement

Since 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, an unprecedented great leap forward in the national economy began to appear in our country, and the rural people's commune movement was realized. In August of this year, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party also put forward such a great call: to complete the main production targets of the second five-year plan in 1959, to strive to catch up with Britain in terms of the output of major industrial products in about ten years, and to strive to complete the twelve-year agricultural development program greatly ahead of schedule. The entire staff of the bank is actively responding to the call of the Party together with the people of the whole country, vigorously opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and actively supporting the great leap forward of the national economy and the consolidation and development of the people's commune through the work of raising funds, managing and using working capital well.

With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the increase in national income, with the growth of fiscal revenue and people's income, on this basis, the bank's credit funds have also increased rapidly with the pace of the leap forward. From the beginning of 1958 to June 1959, in one and a half years, the increase in bank deposits was equivalent to 119.4% of the total increase in deposits during the first five-year plan period. During the same period, the increase in bank loans was equivalent to 129.4% of the total increase in loans during the first five-year plan period. This fact fully shows that the most reliable source of production funds is the development of production. The great leap forward in China’s national economy is the foundation for the great leap forward in bank loan revenue and expenditure.

The Party's general line stipulates: on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, implementing the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry, simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, simultaneously developing large-scale enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and simultaneously developing foreign methods of production and indigenous methods of production, a complete set of "walking on two legs" policy. China's industrial production has been greatly developed by implementing the Party's several simultaneous development policies. In 1958, the total industrial output value increased by 66% compared with 1957, and in the first half of 1959, it increased by 65% compared with the same period in 1958. Under the policy of taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward, 8 million tons of foreign steel were completed in 1958, an increase of 49.5% compared with 1957. It is planned to complete 12 million tons in 1959, an increase of 50% compared with 1958. Other industries, with the exception of a few varieties, have made great leaps forward.

In the great leap forward in industry in 1958, the bank prominently supported the mass steelmaking movement, increasing loans by 2 billion yuan. On the one hand, it actively supported the mass movement of foreign steel production by large-scale enterprises, and on the other hand, it actively supported the mass movement of indigenous steel production by small-scale enterprises, promoting the multiple increase in steel production.

The rapid growth of local industry is also an important aspect of the great leap forward. In addition to meeting the working capital needs of local enterprises to expand production, the bank also vigorously supported the development of newly built local enterprises. For newly built enterprises, according to the planning of the local party committee to develop local industry, in addition to the allocation of funds by the local finance, the bank also raised funds from various sources and issued a part of small-scale capital construction loans to build new enterprises. The bank also helped newly built enterprises establish and improve accounting and financial systems, so that expenditures were reduced, income was increased, capital turnover was accelerated, and costs were reduced. At the same time, the bank also cooperated with relevant parties to help industrial enterprises tap the potential of materials. Within a certain range, it assisted enterprises in adjusting the surplus and deficiency of materials that were tapped. This not only promoted the leap forward in enterprise production, but also facilitated the management of working capital.

The people's commune is a combination of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and simultaneously develops agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. In supporting the people's commune movement, the bank implemented the resolutions and instructions of the Party Central Committee on the people's commune issue, helped the commune develop production, carry out diversified operations, strengthen financial management and economic accounting, and implement the principle of diligence and thrift in running the commune. In solving the commune’s production capital, it implemented the policy of mainly relying on the commune’s self-reliance and supplemented by national assistance. First, it gave full play to the strength of the commune’s own funds, and at the same time, the state also actively provided financial assistance. From the beginning of 1958 to September 1959, the Ministry of Finance allocated 1 billion yuan to support poor communes and poor teams. The bank increased industrial and agricultural loans to the commune by 2.16 billion yuan, and the commercial sector increased advance purchase deposits by 910 million yuan, totaling 4.07 billion yuan. During the same period, the deposits of credit cooperatives also increased by 110 million yuan, and loans also increased accordingly. This greatly promoted the all-round development of the commune's industrial and agricultural production and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. The various funds supported by the state to the commune (including bank loans, national financial investment, and the commercial sector’s advance purchase deposits) are uniformly arranged under the leadership of the local party committee, combining the state’s funds to support the commune with the commune’s own funds, combining the state’s capital investment in rural areas with material supplies, considering the overall situation and making unified arrangements, so that capital support and material supplies can meet the needs of the agricultural production movement and powerfully promote the great leap forward in agricultural production.

Developing diversified operations is an important aspect of the commune's development of production and increasing the commune's cash income. In addition to increasing self-sufficiency production, the commune can also increase commodity production to supply the needs of the market and industrial production. The bank helped the commune develop diversified operations. In addition to providing financial support, it also helped the commune find production methods, formulate production plans and capital plans, and help the commune find outlets for products, so that the commune's diversified operations could be carried out smoothly.

During the Great Leap Forward, the enthusiasm of the masses to support the leap forward was very high, and mass savings campaigns were constantly launched among the masses. From the beginning of 1958 to the end of August 1959, urban savings nationwide increased by 1.36 billion yuan, equivalent to 70.5% of the total increase in urban savings during the first five-year plan period. Over the past ten years, the total amount of savings nationwide has reached 4.15 billion yuan. There are more than 100,000 savings institutions of national banks, including more than 60,000 agency institutions, more than 80,000 agents, and more than 360,000 assistant savings propagandists. This is the result of the rapid development of the national economy and the continuous improvement of people's living standards. It is the result of the masses supporting socialist construction and the vast number of bank employees implementing the Party's policies and the working methods of the mass line.

The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy pointed out that "Savings should be vigorously promoted among urban and rural residents so that personal cash that is temporarily not used can be reasonably and effectively used in construction undertakings, which is beneficial to both the country and the family. The whole Party and the people of the whole country must be told that we must not only be good at arranging production, but also be good at arranging life, be able to live a life, make careful calculations, and keep reserves." Now, the savings cadres across the country are continuing to rely on the masses with full energy, publicizing the Party's policy on savings, and promoting the continued development of the savings business.

Actively carry out international clearing with the development of national foreign trade

Over the past ten years, China's foreign trade has also greatly developed. In 1958, the total value of foreign trade increased by 2.1 times compared with 1950. The bank supports the development of national foreign trade by providing loans and organizing international clearing. Up to now, China has established trade payment relations with 93 countries and regions on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and has signed intergovernmental trade treaties or agreements with 27 of them, making corresponding provisions for payment clearing between the two countries.

China's trade with fraternal countries in the socialist camp is the most solid and reliable foundation for the development of China's foreign trade, and it is also the main part of China's foreign trade. Therefore, with the vigorous development of trade between China and socialist fraternal countries, international payment clearing relations have also been constantly developing. In 1958, China's foreign exchange income and expenditure from trade with socialist fraternal countries increased by more than five times compared with 1950. Over the past ten years, the total amount of foreign exchange income and expenditure from trade between China and socialist countries has accounted for about 75% of the total amount of foreign exchange income and expenditure from China's foreign trade.

In the international clearing relations with Asian and African nationally independent countries, China has always resolutely implemented the principle of equality and mutual benefit, strictly respected the wishes of the other party, and never attached any unequal special conditions to harm the sovereignty and economic interests of the other country. According to the trade agreement or trade needs between the two countries, we have adopted the method of using the other country's currency for accounting and payment for some countries in order to facilitate foreign payments by both parties, give play to the trade potential of both parties, and develop trade exchanges.

Over the past ten years, China has also consistently established and developed international clearing relations with Western countries in accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit, according to the needs of China's foreign trade. Although American imperialism has consistently been hostile to the Chinese people since 1950 and has implemented "embargo" and "freezing" measures against us. Some Western countries have also followed American imperialism and continuously implemented various discriminatory policies against China, attempting to restrict China's economic development. However, their conspiracies have completely miscalculated. For China, these measures cannot hinder the victorious progress of economic construction and the development of foreign trade at all. On the contrary, they will promote our self-reliance and build our own country faster. Those countries that follow American imperialism have suffered serious losses themselves. Now, China has successively signed intergovernmental trade agreements with Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and other countries, and has made corresponding provisions in terms of payment clearing. The Bank of China, a joint state-private foreign exchange professional bank under the leadership of the People's Bank of China, has also successively established correspondent bank and current account bank relations with banks in the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Italy and other countries. It should be pointed out that the development of international clearing relations must have a friendly political atmosphere. Certain countries adopt discriminatory or unfriendly attitudes towards China, which is not only intolerable to us, but also runs counter to the interests of their own people.

Remittances from overseas Chinese are the remittances of labor income and occupational income that overseas Chinese remit back to the country to support their families, and are one of the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese and their families. At the same time, remittances from overseas Chinese also have a positive effect on China's socialist construction. The state's protection of remittances from overseas Chinese is a long-term policy. After socialism is built, remittances from overseas Chinese will still be owned by individuals. As early as the early days of liberation, the Party and the government clearly announced that the policy on remittances from overseas Chinese was: "Facilitate remittances from overseas Chinese and serve overseas Chinese." In order to implement this policy, banks and the overseas Chinese remittance industry have continuously strengthened the work of serving overseas Chinese and their families, improved overseas Chinese remittance payment procedures, and improved work efficiency. All these policies and work have been welcomed by the majority of overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese. Some hostile elements at home and abroad have used some temporary and individual shortcomings in our work to spread rumors, slander, and distort facts, attempting to provoke the relationship between overseas Chinese and the motherland, and alienate the relationship between China and some Southeast Asian countries. These sinister tricks always fall apart in the face of ironclad facts. Their conspiracy will never succeed.

Oppose Right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, adhere to political command, adhere to the mass line, and further carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy

The fundamental reason why financial work has been able to achieve success in the past ten years is to adhere to political command and the mass line.

Bank work must implement the Party's general line and serve the central tasks of the Party at various periods. To achieve this, we must seriously study the Party's general line, seriously implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, thoroughly oppose right-leaning opportunism, boost morale, and launch a mass movement to increase production and practice economy.

The mass line is one of the most fundamental political and organizational lines of our Party. The general line of socialist construction formulated by the Party is the general line of building socialism under the leadership of the Party and by means of carrying out mass movements. Only by going all out, aiming high, and mobilizing all positive factors in the country can we build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This has been powerfully proven in the great leap forward last year and in the first nine months of this year. Therefore, in the work of any department, we must resolutely implement the Party's general line of socialist construction, boldly mobilize the masses, we must oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, we must believe that the people have infinite wisdom, stand firmly at the forefront of the mass movement, and lead the masses forward together on the basis of mass consciousness.

The bank implements the Party's general line by raising funds, managing and using working capital well, and promoting the completion of various indicators of the national economy. To successfully complete this task, we must fully mobilize the masses under the leadership of the Party and vigorously carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy. According to the experience created in various places during the Great Leap Forward, in order to complete the work task through the mass line, the bank must closely combine the mass movement within the bank with the movement to increase production and practice economy of various industrial and commercial enterprises and various people's communes. Only such a combination can achieve both increased production and economy, can manage and use the state's working capital well, and give full play to the effectiveness of the state's support funds for the people's communes. Experience has proven that whenever tasks are arranged, the purpose of the task and the policy boundaries are clearly explained to the masses, and the masses are boldly mobilized, and the tasks are completed through mass movements, then it will be faster, better, and more economical, and at the same time of completing the tasks, people will be trained and the ideological awareness of the masses will be improved. Some people with right-leaning opportunist ideas only see business, only see technology, and do not see people, and do not believe in the power of mass movements. Some of them are fundamentally unwilling to mobilize the masses, believing that cold and quiet administrative methods are the best way to complete tasks. In fact, according to their methods, there can only be less, slower, worse, and more expensive, and there can be no more, faster, better, and more economical. Some people, under the impetus of their superiors, cannot but mobilize the masses, but they do not boldly mobilize and actively lead the masses, but are worried and restrict them in many ways after the masses rise up. As a result, there is no mass movement, and they still move towards less, slower, worse, and more expensive. It is necessary to resolutely criticize and overcome the right-leaning thoughts of some cadres. The method is to start from the desire for unity, and after criticism or struggle, the contradictions will be resolved, so as to achieve new unity on a new basis.

Chairman Mao's fundamental idea on financial work is: "The quality of financial policy can indeed affect the economy, but it is the economy that determines finance. There is no way to solve financial difficulties without an economic foundation, and there is no way to make finance abundant without economic development." Chairman Mao's fundamental idea has been proven to be completely correct through the revolutionary period and socialist construction, and it has also been proven to be completely correct for the bank's credit work. Especially during the Great Leap Forward since 1958, the vast number of bank employees felt more keenly the intimacy of Chairman Mao's thought for our work. We use credit funds to support production. As production develops, national income increases, and the state's fiscal revenue and the income of the people also increase accordingly, the bank's credit funds also increase with the pace of the leap forward. Although in actual work, there have been shortcomings that blurred the boundaries between fiscal funds and credit funds, this shortcoming is only temporary, and since January of this year, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and local party committees at all levels, it has been corrected. The vast number of employees have grasped Chairman Mao's guiding ideology for financial work. This power is infinite, and it is a long-term driving force for our work, encouraging us to move forward.

The achievements of financial work in the past ten years are inseparable from the enthusiastic, arduous, and sincere assistance of Soviet experts. Soviet experts treat our work tasks as their own tasks, and treat our achievements and difficulties in our work as their own achievements and difficulties. We express our thanks to the Soviet experts who have helped us!

Now, just as our country is celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the national situation is extremely good. Let us boost morale, oppose right-leaning tendencies, boldly mobilize the masses, and strive to raise funds, manage and use working capital well, and promote the completion and overfulfillment of the national economic plan.

    十年来的金融事业
    中国人民银行行长　曹菊如
    伟大的中华人民共和国建国十年来，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的历史性的伟大胜利。现在全国人民正在意气风发，欢欣鼓舞，从各个战线上用更大的跃进成绩来庆祝建国十周年。我国的金融事业，十年来始终围绕着党和国家各个时期的中心任务，为贯彻党的总路线服务，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中发挥了积极作用，取得了重大的成就。
    建立了独立自主的、统一的、稳定的货币制度和社会主义的金融体系
    旧中国在国民党反动政权的长期统治下，金融事业也深刻地表现了半封建、半殖民地的性质。到解放前夕，国民党统治的地区，金融市场处于一个极端混乱的局面：伪法币急剧贬值，物价疯狂上涨；金、银和外国货币充斥市场，成为金融投机的主要对象；官僚资本银行、帝国主义银行、私营银行钱庄成为市场上进行投机的核心；帝国主义在中国开设的银行，不仅任意发行货币，而且还垄断了中国的国际清算，操纵中国的外汇价格，奴役和剥削中国人民。这种情况使百孔千疮的国民经济遭到更加严重的破坏，这种情况给广大劳动人民的生活带来极大的困苦和不安。全国解放以后，在中国共产党的英明领导下，迅速彻底地肃清了伪币、外币和金、银的流通，严格取缔了金融投机，没收了官僚资本银行，摧毁了帝国主义银行的一切特权，建立了独立自主的、统一的货币制度和社会主义性质的金融体系。
    建国初期，党和政府为了稳定金融物价，给迅速恢复国民经济造成有利条件，于1950年3月颁布了“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”，在全国人民的努力下，经过几个月的时间，即迅速地实现了财政收支平衡、物资调拨平衡、现金收支平衡。中国人民银行在贯彻这项决定中，坚决地实行了现金管理办法，把国家分散在企业、机关、团体、部队等单位的大量现金，集中到银行里来，同时把集中的大量资金，用来支持国营商业掌握物资，加强国营经济领导市场的物质力量，有效地打击市场投机。在贯彻执行这项决定中，银行还迅速地建立了全国通汇网，便利国家资金的统一调拨和集中运用。这样，随着财政、物资平衡的胜利实现，金融物价迅速得到了稳定，根本扭转了反动统治造成的历时十二年的通货膨胀、物价飞涨的局面。财经战线上这一辉煌的胜利，标志着我国财经状况已经开始好转，为国民经济的恢复和发展创造了有利条件。当全国刚解放的时候，国内外的敌人，曾经断言，共产党在军事上政治上是胜利了，但是财经工作上的困难是无法克服的。可是事实如何呢？事实响亮地驳斥了敌人的谰言。中国人民在建国以后短短的时间里，就在财经战线上打了一个非常漂亮的胜仗。
    1955年3月，由于生产不断发展，物价长期稳定，广大人民群众要求改变人民币的计算单位，使市场交易更加便利；为此，党中央和国务院决定发行新的人民币，用新币收兑旧币，收兑的比率是新人民币一元兑换旧人民币一万元，国家规定，持有人民币的人，不问阶级阶层都同样以一万元旧币兑换一元新币，人们换得新币以后，以一元新币能向市场买到相等于旧币一万元的物资。新人民币的发行，大大便利了交易和核算。我国货币制度从此更进一步健全和巩固起来了。
    以1950年3月的物价为100，到1958年年底，全国批发物价指数是92.7％，八大城市的零售物价指数是101.4，这证明人民币的币值是长期稳定的。
    我国人民币能够保持币值的长期稳定，这是社会主义制度的必然的产物，是在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在生产高速发展的基础上，有计划地调节货币流通的结果。
    十年来国家的财政不仅保证了收支平衡，并且经常有一定的结余，作为国家的后备力量；国家发行货币是通过银行的信贷渠道，根据生产发展、商品流通扩大和市场上季节性的变化，相应地投放或者回笼；国家在安排国民经济计划时，经常使消费品生产和供应的增长同人民购买力的增长相适应，这样就避免市场货币量过多或者过少的现象，保证货币的正常流通。
    在大跃进的时期中，右派分子曾经说我们的人民币不稳定了，现在事实证明，和他们的诬蔑相反，我国人民币同其他社会主义国家的货币一样，是世界上最稳定的货币之一。所有资本主义的所谓强国包括美帝国主义在内，它们的通货膨胀是注定不可避免的。事实上从美元数起，许多资本主义国家的货币，都在不断地贬值，难道这不是社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越，东风压倒西风的一个有力的证明吗？
    在经济恢复时期内，银行根据党对资本主义工商业利用、限制、改造的政策，对私营银行和钱庄，一方面实行了严格的行政管理，限制其投机活动，另一方面在国家银行领导下，疏导其资金，使之用于正当工商业的放款；并且逐步组织它们联合放款，联合经营业务。“五反”运动中，私营行庄被揭发出大量违法投机活动，它们赖以生存的由违法投机活动所造成的市场虚假繁荣，已经不存在了，它们在社会上吸收游资、调剂资金的作用日益缩小，而同时，中国人民银行在金融市场的领导作用则日益加强。以吸收储蓄和私营工商业存款为例：1950年6月到1952年12月，两年半中间，国家银行所占比重由58.6％上升为92.8％，私营银行和钱庄所占比重由41.4％下降为7.2％。私营银行和钱庄在这时期内普遍亏损，经营困难，已难继续存在。适应这一情况，国家于1952年12月对私营银行钱庄实行了全行业公私合营，组成公私合营银行，在中国人民银行领导下经营业务，从而基本上完成了私营金融业的社会主义改造，在我国结束了资本主义的金融事业，建成了统一的社会主义金融体系，并为国家对资本主义工商业的进一步社会主义改造，提供了有利的条件。
    支援社会主义工业化和社会主义改造
    进入有计划建设时期，国家的工业生产不断扩大，在第一个五年计划期间，工业（包括手工业）总产值增加了一点二八倍，新建和扩建的企业有一万多个，其中全部投入生产和部分投入生产的限额以上的建设单位有五百三十七个。工业生产所需要的流动资金，除了国家财政拨给一定的定额流动资金外，银行负责贷款支援季节性和临时性的资金需要。在这个时期内，银行的工业贷款增加了二点三倍，满足了国营工业季节性临时性流动资金的需要。在这些贷款中，重工业放款占50％以上，贯彻了国家优先发展重工业的方针。
    国营和合作社营商业在这个时期既要为城乡物资交流、为生产和人民消费服务，又担负着对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的任务。银行为了支持国营和合作社营商业不断扩大，支持社会主义商业对资本主义工商业实行加工、订货、统购、包销的资金需要，从1953年到1957年五年中，国营商业贷款增长了两倍以上。国营商业和合作社营商业还担负收购农产品的任务，银行对收购农产品采取按照实际需要充分供应资金的方针，保证国营商业完成粮、棉等主要农产品收购的资金需要。即是收购多少商品，供应多少资金，在哪里收购商品，就在哪里供应资金，什么时候收购，就在什么时候供应资金，这就有力地支援了农产品收购任务的完成。
    为了彻底完成民主革命的任务，国家在开国以后，即在全国范围内，进行了伟大的土地改革运动，经过三年时间，有大约三亿贫苦农民，分得了大约七亿亩土地和其他大量的生产资料，从此彻底摧毁了千百年来残酷剥削农民的封建土地所有制。贫苦农民在分得土地以后，资金方面还需要国家给以必要的支持，才能使他们有条件生产，生活稳定，安心生产。党在这时决定给贫农以贷款的支持。从1950年到1952年，银行根据党的指示，共增加农贷四点二亿元，其中70％—80％是贷给分得土地以后的贫苦农民的。
    接着，全国农民在党中央和毛主席的领导下，向着组织起来、逐步实现农业合作化的道路前进。从1953年起，经过了互助合作的阶段，1955年秋季，全国掀起了农业社会主义改造高潮，到1956年年底，占全国96％的农户组织了七十五万多个农业合作社，而且绝大多数加入了高级合作社。在这期间，银行的农业贷款主要是促进和帮助农业合作化，同时对个体农民的资金困难，也给予热情的关怀。从1953年到1956年农业贷款增加二十六亿元。仅1956年农业社会主义改造的高潮中，就增加了贷款二十点三亿元。其中包括贫农合作基金贷款七亿元。这笔贫农合作基金帮助了约四千万贫苦农户解决了入社基金的困难。在农业合作化高潮中，发放这些贷款对于巩固地树立贫农在农业合作社的优势，对于增强贫农和中农间的团结都起了积极作用。
    根据党关于发展农业生产合作的指示，在农村中还发展了信用合作社的组织。农村信用合作社1953年共有九千四百一十八个，到1955年年底就基本上实现了乡乡有社。入社农户约达七千六百多万户。信用合作社同国家银行的基层机构一起组织群众资金，打击高利贷，解决贫农下中农在生产生活上的困难，促进了农业互助合作运动的发展。
    在社会主义改造高潮中，银行对手工业合作社给以贷款支持，解决了它们在改造后扩大生产的资金需要。1956年一年中，对手工业合作社放款增长了三倍。在资本主义全行业公私合营的高潮中，对合营企业放款增长五点八倍，充实了它们在合营以后扩大生产和经营的流动资金。
    贯彻社会主义建设总路线支援生产大跃进和人民公社化
    从1958年起，在党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，开始在我国出现了一个前所未有的国民经济大跃进，实现了农村人民公社化。今年8月，党的八届八中全会又提出这样的伟大号召：在1959年完成第二个五年计划的主要生产指标，争取在十年左右的时间内，实现在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国的口号，争取大大提前完成十二年农业发展纲要。银行的全体职工正和全国人民一起，积极响应党的号召，轰轰烈烈地反右倾、鼓干劲，开展增产节约运动，通过筹集资金，管好用好流动资金的工作，积极支援国民经济的大跃进和人民公社的巩固和发展。
    随着工农业生产的大跃进和国民收入的增加，随着财政收入和人民收入的增长，在这一基础上，银行的信贷资金来源也以跃进的步伐迅速增加。从1958年年初到1959年6月，一年半中，银行存款增加的部分，相当于第一个五年计划期间存款增加总额的119.4％。在同一时期，银行放款增加的部分，相当于第一个五年计划期间放款增加总额的129.4％。这个事实充分说明，生产资金最可靠的来源就是生产的发展。我国国民经济的大跃进，正是银行贷款收支跃进的基础。
    党的总路线规定：在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行工业与农业同时并举，重工业与轻工业同时并举，中央工业与地方工业同时并举，大型企业与中小型企业同时并举，洋法生产与土法生产同时并举的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针。我国工业生产贯彻了党的这几个并举的方针，得到飞跃的发展。1958年工业总产值比1957年增长了66％，1959年上半年又比1958年同期增长了65％。在以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针下，1958年洋钢完成了八百万吨，比1957年增长49.5％，1959年计划完成一千二百万吨，比1958年增长50％，其他各种工业，除少数品种外，都有很大的跃进。
    银行在1958年的工业大跃进中，突出地支援了大炼钢铁运动，增加了二十亿元的贷款，一方面积极支持大型企业洋法生产的群众运动，另方面积极支持小型企业土法生产的群众运动，促进了钢铁生产成倍的增长。
    地方工业的迅速成长，也是大跃进中的一个重要方面。银行除满足地方企业扩大生产的流动资金需要外，还大力支持了新建地方企业的发展。对新建企业，根据党委发展地方工业的规划，除地方财政拨款外，银行还多方面筹集资金，发放了一部分小型基本建设贷款，建设新的企业。银行对新建企业还帮助它们建立和健全了账务和财务制度，使开支减少，收入增加，资金周转加快，成本降低。同时，银行还同有关方面共同协作，帮助工业企业挖掘物资潜力，在一定的范围内，对挖掘出来的物资，协助企业调剂有无。这样既促进了企业生产的跃进，又有利于流动资金的管理。
    人民公社是工农商学兵合一，农林牧副渔同时开展的，银行在支援人民公社化运动中，贯彻执行了党中央关于人民公社问题的决议和指示，帮助公社发展生产，开展多种经营，加强财务管理和经济核算，贯彻勤俭办社的原则。在解决公社的生产资金方面，贯彻以公社自力更生为主国家援助为辅的方针，首先发挥公社自有资金的力量，同时国家也积极给以资金援助。1958年初到1959年9月，财政拨款十亿元支援贫社贫队，银行对公社增加工农业贷款二十一点六亿元，商业部门增加预购定金九点一亿元，合计四十点七亿元。同一时期内，信用社的存款也增加了一点一亿元，放款也有相应的增加。这就大大促进了公社工农业生产和农林牧副渔的全面发展。国家对公社支援的各项资金（包括银行贷款、国家财政投资和商业部门的预购定金）是在地方党委的领导下统一安排的，把国家支援公社的资金和公社的自有资金结合起来，把国家在农村中的资金投放和物资供应结合起来，统筹考虑，统一安排，就能够做到资金支援和物资供应都适应农业生产运动的需要，有力地促进农业生产的大跃进。
    开展多种经营是公社发展生产增加公社现金收入的一个重要方面，公社除了可以增加自给性生产外，还可以增加商品生产，供应市场和工业生产的需要。银行帮助公社开展多种经营，除在资金上给予了支援外，还帮助公社寻找生产门路，制订生产规划和资金规划，帮助公社为产品找出路，使公社的多种经营得以顺利进行。
    在大跃进中，群众支援跃进的热情非常高涨，群众中不断掀起轰轰烈烈的自觉参加的储蓄运动高潮。从1958年初到1959年8月底，全国城镇储蓄增长了十三点六亿元，相当于第一个五年计划期间城镇储蓄增长总额的70.5％。十年来全国储蓄总额已达四十一点五亿元。全国银行的储蓄机构已达十万多个，其中包括代办机构有六万多个，代办员八万多人，协助储蓄宣传员三十六万多人。这是国民经济飞跃发展、人民生活水平不断提高的结果，这是群众支持社会主义建设和银行广大职工贯彻执行了党的政策和群众路线的工作方法的结果。
    党的八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议指出“在城乡居民中都要大力提倡储蓄，使个人暂时可以不用的现金，在建设事业中得到合理的、有效的利用，既有利于国，又有利于家。要告诉全党和全国人民，我们不但要善于安排生产，而且要善于安排生活，会过日子，精打细算，留有后备。”现在全国储蓄干部正在干劲十足地继续依靠群众，宣传党对储蓄的方针，推动储蓄事业的继续向前发展。
    随着国家对外贸易的发展积极地开展国际清算
    十年来，我国对外贸易也有很大的发展，1958年对外贸易总额比1950年增长了二点一倍。银行通过贷款和组织国际清算，支援国家对外贸易的开展。到目前为止，我国在平等互利的基础上同九十三个国家和地区建立了贸易支付关系，并且同其中的二十七个国家签订了政府间的贸易条约或协定，对双方国家间的支付清算，也做了相应的规定。
    我国同社会主义阵营各兄弟国家的贸易，是我国对外贸易发展的最巩固最可靠的基础，也是我国对外贸易中的主要部分。因此，随着我国和社会主义兄弟各国之间贸易的蓬勃发展，国际支付清算关系也有着不断的发展。1958年我国同社会主义阵营各兄弟国家间的贸易外汇收支，比1950年增长了五倍还多。十年来，我国和社会主义国家间的贸易外汇收支总额，在我国对外贸易外汇收支总额中所占的比重约为75％。
    我国在对亚非民族独立国家的国际清算关系中，一贯坚决执行着平等互利的原则，严格尊重对方的愿望，从不附加任何不平等的特殊条件，损害对方国家的主权和经济利益。根据两国间的贸易协定或贸易需要，我们对有些国家，采取了用对方国家货币记账支付的方式，以利于双方对外支付，发挥双方贸易潜力，发展互通有无的贸易往来。
    十年来，我国还一贯按照平等互利的原则，根据我国对外贸易的需要，同西方国家建立和发展着国际清算关系，虽然美帝国主义自1950年以来一贯敌视我国人民，对我实施“禁运”“冻结”。某些西方国家也追随美帝国主义对我国不断实行各种歧视政策，企图限制我国经济的发展。但是，他们的这些阴谋完全失算了。对于我国来说，这些措施根本阻碍不了经济建设的胜利进行和对外贸易的发展，恰恰相反，反而会促进我们自力更生，更快地建设自己的国家，而那些追随美帝国主义的国家，自己却遭受了严重的损失。现在，我国已先后同芬兰、瑞典、丹麦、挪威等国家签订了政府间的贸易协定，在支付清算方面，也做了相应的规定。受中国人民银行领导的公私合营性质的我国外汇专业银行——中国银行，还先后同英国、法国、西德、荷兰、瑞士、奥地利、比利时、意大利等国家的银行，建立了代理行和往来行关系。应该指出，国际清算关系的发展，必须具备友好的政治气氛，某些国家对我国采取歧视或不友好态度，不但我们不能容忍，而且也是同他们本国人民的利益背道而驰的。
    侨汇是我国华侨将劳动所得和职业所得，汇回国内瞻养家属的汇款，是侨胞侨眷的正当权益之一；同时，侨汇对我国社会主义建设也有积极作用。国家保护侨汇是长远的政策，在社会主义建成之后，侨汇仍然归个人所有。早在解放初期，党和政府就明确地宣布华侨汇款的方针是：“便利侨汇，服务侨胞”。为了贯彻这个方针，银行和侨汇业曾不断地加强为侨胞侨眷服务的工作，改进侨汇解付手续，提高工作效率。所有这些政策和工作，受到了广大侨眷和广大归侨的欢迎。国内外有些敌对分子，利用我们工作中某些暂时的个别缺点，造谣诬蔑，歪曲事实，企图挑拨华侨和祖国的关系，并且离间我国和东南亚某些国家的关系。这些鬼蜮伎俩，在铁的事实面前，总是不攻自破的。他们的阴谋，是永远不会得逞的。
    反右倾、鼓干劲，坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众路线，进一步开展增产节约运动
    十年来金融事业能够取得成就的根本原因，是坚持政治挂帅和群众路线。
    银行工作必须贯彻党的总路线，为党的各个时期的中心任务服务，要做到这一点，必须认真学习党的总路线，认真贯彻党的八届八中全会的决议，彻底反对右倾机会主义，鼓足干劲，展开群众性的增产节约运动。
    群众路线是我们党的一条最根本的政治路线和组织路线，党所制定的社会主义建设总路线，就是在党的领导下，用大搞群众运动的方法来建设社会主义的总路线，只有鼓足干劲，力争上游，调动全国一切积极因素，才能多快好省地建设社会主义。这在去年和今年九个月的大跃进中，已经得到有力的证明，因此，在任何部门的工作中，都必须坚决地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，放手发动群众，必须反右倾、鼓干劲，必须相信人民群众具有无穷的智慧，坚定地站在群众运动的最前面，在群众自觉的基础上，领导群众一同前进。
    银行是通过筹集资金，管好用好流动资金，促进国民经济各项指标的完成，来贯彻执行党的总路线的。要完满地实现这个任务，必须在党的领导下，充分发动群众，轰轰烈烈地大搞增产节约运动。根据在大跃进中各地创造的经验，银行要通过群众路线完成工作任务，必须把银行内部的群众运动和各工商企业、各人民公社的增产节约运动，密切地结合起来。只有这样的结合，才能做到既增产，又节约，才能做到管好用好国家的流动资金，充分发挥国家对人民公社支援资金的效用。经验证明，凡是在安排任务时，向群众交代清楚任务的目的和政策界限，并且放手发动群众，通过群众运动完成任务，就能多快好省，就能在完成任务的同时，又锻炼了人，提高了群众的思想觉悟。某些有右倾机会主义思想的人，只看见业务，只看见技术，看不见人，不相信群众运动的力量。他们当中有的人根本不愿意发动群众，认为冷冷清清的行政办法是完成任务的最好办法。实际上照他们的办法，只有少慢差费，不能多快好省。有的人在上级推动下，不能不发动群众，但是他们对群众不是放手发动，积极领导，而是当群众起来以后，忧心忡忡，多方约束，结果，也是没有群众运动，仍然走向少慢差费。必须坚决批判和克服某些干部中的右倾思想，其方法是从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争，使矛盾得到解决，从而在新的基础上达到新的团结。
    毛主席关于财政工作的根本思想是：“财政政策的好坏固然足以影响经济，但是决定财政的却是经济。未有经济无基础而可以解决财政困难的，未有经济不发展而可以使财政充裕的。”毛主席的这条根本思想，经过革命时期和社会主义建设，证明它是完全正确的，对于银行的信贷工作，也一样证明是完全正确的。特别是在1958年以来的大跃进当中，银行的广大职工更感觉到毛主席的思想对于我们工作的亲切。我们用信贷资金支持生产，生产发展了，国民收入增加了，国家财政收入和人民群众的收入也都随着增加，银行的信贷资金来源也就以跃进的步伐向前增加。虽然在实际工作中，曾经发生过模糊财政资金和信贷资金的界限的缺点，但这个缺点只是暂时的，今年1月以来，在党中央和地方各级党委领导下，已经纠正了。广大职工群众掌握毛主席对于财政工作的指导思想，这个力量是无限的，对于我们工作是长远的推动力量，鼓舞着我们前进。
    十年来金融工作的成就是和苏联专家的热情、辛劳和真诚的帮助分不开的。苏联专家把我们的工作任务当做他们自己的任务，把我们工作中的成就和遇到的困难，当做他们自己的成就和困难。我们向帮助我们的苏联专家们致谢！
    现在正当我们国家庆祝建国十周年的时候，全国形势是好极了，让我们鼓足干劲，反对右倾，放手发动群众，为筹集资金，管好用好流动资金，促进国民经济计划的完成和超额完成而奋斗。
