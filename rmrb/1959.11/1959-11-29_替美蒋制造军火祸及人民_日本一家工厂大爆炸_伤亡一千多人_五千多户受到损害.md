Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th - A factory in Yokohama, Japan, manufacturing munitions for the US military and the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique, suffered a major explosion on the 20th, resulting in a tragic incident with over 1,200 casualties.

According to a report in the "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper, the explosion at the Toyo Chemical Company's Yokohama factory resulted in the deaths of three workers, serious injuries to more than twenty workers, injuries to more than three hundred elementary and middle school students who were in class nearby, and injuries to more than one thousand general residents.

The Yokohama Fire Department reported that thirty-one buildings were destroyed. Nearly 5,400 households in the surrounding area were damaged, with losses estimated at approximately 175.3 million yen.

This factory has been manufacturing ammunition for the US military since March 1953. US military rifles, shells, and rockets were piled up like mountains in the factory.

Fragments of wooden crates found at the scene of the incident indicated that the consignee of this batch of munitions was the Chiang Kai-shek clique's navy.

The general manager of the factory said after the explosion: "Work related to the US military will continue."

Japanese Communist Party Senator Masao Iwama questioned the government in the Diet that day regarding the explosion.

He pointed out that such a dangerous factory should be immediately closed in a cultural and educational area where safety and tranquility are needed.

Affected residents nearby, as well as the principals of ten elementary and middle schools in the area, have expressed opposition to the factory resuming operations and have launched a campaign to drive the factory away.

    替美蒋制造军火祸及人民
    日本一家工厂大爆炸
    伤亡一千多人　五千多户受到损害
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本横滨市的一家为美军和台湾蒋介石集团制造军火的工厂在20日发生大爆炸，造成了一千二百多人伤亡的大惨案。
    据“赤旗报”报道，发生爆炸的东洋化工公司横滨工厂有三名工人死亡，二十多名工人受重伤，附近正在上课的小学生、中学生三百多人受伤，一般居民一千多人受伤。
    横滨市消防局统计，有三十一座建筑物被毁。附近地区有将近五千四百户受到损害，损失约达一亿七千五百三十万日元。
    这家工厂从1953年3月开始为美军制造弹药。工场里美军的步枪、炮弹和火箭堆积如山。
    在肇事地点发现的木箱碎片上写明，这批军火的收货人是蒋介石集团的海军。
    这家工厂的总经理在发生爆炸后说：“同美军有关的工作要继续进行”。
    日本共产党参议员岩间正男当天在国会里就这个爆炸事件向政府提出质询。
    他指出，在需要安全和平静的文教地区，应该立即封闭这种危险的工厂。
    附近受害居民以及这个地区内十个小学和中学的校长都表示反对这个工厂复工，并且展开了赶走这个工厂的运动。
