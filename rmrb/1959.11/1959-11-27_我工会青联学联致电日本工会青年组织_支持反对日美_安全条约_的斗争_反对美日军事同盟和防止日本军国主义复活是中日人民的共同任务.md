    Xinhua News Agency, 26th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today sent telegrams to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the National Conference to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," expressing support for the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and wishing the Japanese workers and people greater success in the eighth national unified action day against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to be held on the 27th.
    The telegram stated: The heroic struggle of the Japanese people against the revision and for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" demonstrates their strong determination to strive for peace and independence and oppose war.
    The telegram then pointed out, "Recently, Aiichiro Fujiyama's speech in the Diet nakedly exposed the conspiracy of the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique to revive militarism and their willingness to act as accomplices in the United States' aggressive war policy. The new U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' is directed against China and the Soviet Union and is hostile to the Japanese people and the people of Asia. It is a U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty that attempts to arm Japan with nuclear weapons and cooperate with the United States in preparing for large-scale aggressive wars in the Far East. It is a major danger to peace and security in the Far East."
    The telegram said: "We firmly believe that the Japanese workers and the broad masses of people will overcome all obstacles and difficulties, persist in the struggle, further consolidate and strengthen the unity of democratic forces, and form a broad united front of the working class with all peace-loving people of Japan, drive out U.S. imperialism, and completely shatter the conspiracy of the Kishi Nobusuke government, in order to achieve final victory."
    Xinhua News Agency, 26th. The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation today sent telegrams to the Central Committee of the Japan Democratic Youth League and the Japan "Central Joint Struggle Conference of Youth and Students to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," expressing support for the struggle of the Japanese people and youth and students against the "Security Treaty."
    The telegram stated: "On the occasion of the eighth unified action of the Japanese people and youth and students to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' we, representing 130 million Chinese youth and students, express our full support for your just struggle and sincerely wish your struggle success."
    The telegram said: "The Kishi Nobusuke government, disregarding the strong opposition of the Japanese people, is actively pursuing the war policy of U.S. imperialism and attempting to sign a new U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' in January next year in order to realize the U.S.-Japan military alliance and accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism. This conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries not only directly threatens the security of the Japanese nation, again driving the Japanese people, especially Japanese youth, to serve as cannon fodder for imperialist aggressive wars, but also seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world. Opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance and resolutely preventing the resurgence of Japanese militarist aggressive forces are the common struggle tasks of the Chinese and Japanese peoples and youth. The sympathy and support of peace-loving people in Asia and around the world are on the side of the Japanese people."
    The telegram concluded: "We firmly believe that under the favorable international situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, as long as the Japanese people and Japanese youth and students continue to strengthen unity and persist in the struggle, they will surely be able to completely shatter the conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and achieve victory in the struggle for the peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality of their motherland."

    我工会青联学联致电日本工会青年组织
    支持反对日美“安全条约”的斗争
    反对美日军事同盟和防止日本军国主义复活是中日人民的共同任务
    新华社26日讯　中华全国总工会今天打电报给日本工会总评议会和日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，表示支持日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争，并且祝日本工人和人民将在27日举行的反对修改日美“安全条约”第八次全国统一行动日取得更大的胜利。
    电报说：日本人民为反对修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”所进行的英勇斗争，显示了争取和平、独立、反对战争的坚强决心。
    电报接着指出，“最近藤山爱一郎在国会里的发言，赤裸裸地暴露了岸信介反动集团的复活军国主义的阴谋和甘心充当美国侵略战争政策的帮凶。新的日美‘安全条约’，其矛头是指向中苏并与日本人民和亚洲人民为敌，它是企图用核武器武装日本，配合美国在远东进行大规模侵略战争准备的日美军事同盟条约，是远东和平和安全的主要危险。”
    电报说：“我们深信，日本工人和广大人民必将排除一切障碍和困难，坚持斗争，进一步巩固和加强民主力量的团结，结成工人阶级同所有日本的爱好和平人民的广泛的统一战线，赶走美帝国主义，彻底粉碎岸信介政府的阴谋，以取得最后的胜利。”
    新华社26日讯　中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会今天打电报给日本民主青年同盟中央委员会和日本“青年和学生阻止修改安全条约中央共同斗争会议”，表示支持日本人民和青年、学生反对“安全条约”的斗争。
    电报说：“值此日本人民和青年学生举行阻止修改日美‘安全条约’第八次统一行动之际，我们谨代表一亿三千万中国青年和学生表示全力支持你们的这一正义斗争，并衷心祝贺你们的斗争获得成功。”
    电报说：“岸信介政府不顾日本人民的强烈反对，正积极追随美帝国主义的战争政策，企图在明年1月签订新的日美‘安全条约’，以实现日美军事同盟，加紧复活日本军国主义。美日反动派的这一阴谋，不仅直接威胁日本民族的安全，再次驱使日本人民首先是日本青年充当帝国主义侵略战争的炮灰，而且也严重威胁着亚洲和世界的和平。反对日美军事同盟和坚决防止日本军国主义侵略势力的重新抬头，是中日两国人民和青年的共同斗争任务，亚洲和全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持都在日本人民的一边”。
    电报最后说：“我们深信，在东风压倒西风的有利国际形势下，只要日本人民和日本青年学生继续加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够彻底粉碎美日反动派的阴谋，在争取祖国和平、独立、民主和中立的斗争中获得胜利。”
