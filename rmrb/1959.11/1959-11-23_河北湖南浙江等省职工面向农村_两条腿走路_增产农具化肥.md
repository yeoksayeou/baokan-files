Hebei, Hunan, Zhejiang and other provinces' workers face the countryside
"Walking on two legs" to increase production of agricultural tools and fertilizers

The industrial fronts in Hebei, Hunan, and Zhejiang are making every effort to increase the production of various agricultural machinery, fertilizers, and pesticides through a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, adapting to local conditions and seasonal needs, to support agricultural technological transformation.

Each region has commendable experiences: Hebei conscientiously implements the policy of "walking on two legs," focusing on both large and small equipment, both foreign and indigenous equipment; Hunan pays attention to coordinating with the agricultural season and arranges production one quarter in advance; Zhejiang focuses on variety, high quality, and low cost. Workers in many factories also go to the countryside to listen to farmers' opinions and improve production.

Tianjin, November 22nd (report from our newspaper) The industrial front in Hebei Province, in the process of supporting agricultural technological transformation, conscientiously implements the policy of "walking on two legs," focusing on both large and small equipment, both foreign and indigenous equipment, striving to fully utilize the enthusiasm of all industrial sectors to support agriculture, and using various types of machinery and equipment to accelerate the arming of agriculture.

The province and many regions, in arranging plans for industrial support for agricultural technological transformation, and in organizing production, allocating materials and equipment, comprehensively consider the needs of large and medium-sized water conservancy machinery and agricultural machinery, small agricultural machinery and simple farm tools. In the fourth quarter of this year alone, in order to increase the production of small farm tools and water conservancy tools, the province has allocated an additional one thousand tons of pig iron.

Various localities have successively held agricultural machinery conferences to arrange the production of various large and medium-sized agricultural machinery and irrigation and drainage machinery for next year. In order to create favorable conditions for the large-scale production of various large-scale water conservancy machinery and agricultural machinery next year, the province is carrying out a technical training campaign, actively trial-manufacturing new products on the one hand, and preparing for the mass production of special tools, process procedures, etc. on the other hand. At present, more than ten new products, such as the 1140 coal gas and diesel dual-purpose engine, 72-horsepower diesel engine, 6-horsepower tractor, cultivator seeder, 24-row seeder, and large thresher, have been trial-manufactured and have begun small-scale production. In addition, five large machinery factories have begun expanding ahead of schedule.

While focusing on the manufacture of large and medium-sized agricultural machinery, the local Party committees have also mobilized small enterprises serving agriculture, especially county and commune industries and rural craftsmen, to produce large quantities of simple farm tools and water conservancy tools. In the past three months, areas such as Shijiazhuang, Handan, Baoding, Tangshan, and Tianjin have produced more than five million pieces of various small farm tools and small agricultural machinery. The workers of the county and commune industries and the rural craftsmen of Ningjin County closely cooperate and coordinate with each other, and have reformed and created more than 100 kinds of tools for deep plowing, sowing, pest control, slicing, and rice and flour processing, and have produced more than 79,000 pieces. These tools generally can increase work efficiency by one to two times, and some can increase efficiency by several to dozens of times.

(Report from our newspaper) The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a meeting on industrial and handicraft work, taking support for agriculture as the primary task of the industrial front, and made a general plan for industrial support for agriculture. The Provincial Committee requested that the industrial and handicraft departments arrange the production of machinery and farm tools needed for agriculture next year a quarter earlier than in previous years, in the fourth quarter of this year, to ensure timely supply.

Now, a production upsurge to support agriculture has been set off throughout the province. The workers of large industrial enterprises have launched discussions on "how industry can support agriculture," and many enterprises have formulated plans to support agricultural production. After the workers of the Hengyang Jianxiang Machinery Factory overfulfilled this year's agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery production task in early October, they decided to overproduce more than 300 diesel engines for the countryside within the year. The workers of Xiangtan Machinery Factory boldly innovated and created, and produced 400 mm internal combustion water pumps and automatic threshers.

In order to support agricultural production more, faster, and better, industrial and handicraft workers in various parts of the province are trying every possible means to solve the problems existing in technology, equipment, and raw material supply. The workers of Hengyang Machinery Factory realized more than 5,000 innovation projects and made more than 60 sets of indigenous equipment, which greatly improved production efficiency and overcame the difficulty of insufficient equipment. The workers of Hunan Pesticide Factory have improved production equipment, striving to overproduce another 3,000 tons of pesticides, and to achieve high output and good quality.

While rushing to manufacture agricultural machinery, various localities are also actively carrying out the repair of irrigation and drainage power machinery. The mechanical industry workers in Shaoyang, Changde, Hengyang, Xiangtan, Qianyang and other regions have adopted the method of assigning responsibility to specific areas and pairing up for repairs, implementing repairs as soon as they arrive and as soon as they are called.

Hangzhou, November 22nd (report from our newspaper) The workers of Zhejiang Province Agricultural Machinery Factory, Fertilizer Factory, and Pesticide Factory produce agricultural means of production in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way to support the development of production in the People's Communes. The agricultural tool machinery factories throughout the province have produced more than 6 million pieces of harvesting, threshing, deep plowing, transportation and other machinery and farm tools, most of which have now been shipped to the countryside. More than 12 million pieces of small farm tools rushed out by handicraft workers have played a role in production. More than 10,000 catties of chemical fertilizers produced by various fertilizer factories are being transferred to the countryside.

This year, the agricultural means of production produced in Zhejiang Province has not only greatly increased in quantity compared with last year, but also has more varieties, higher quality, and lower cost. Agricultural machinery has added dozens of new varieties such as East China paddy field plows. The variety of pesticides has also increased from the original three or four to eighteen. The quality of most of these products is very good.

In order to better support agriculture, the vast number of workers in Zhejiang Province's agricultural tool machinery factories, fertilizer factories, and pesticide factories are conducting in-depth socialist competitions, trying every possible means to improve product quality and work efficiency. The workers of Hangzhou Automobile Factory, which manufactures diesel engines, went to the countryside to listen to farmers' opinions and continuously improved the production of diesel engines, increasing the efficiency of diesel engines by 65% compared to the original and saving 40% of materials. The workers of Haining Pesticide Factory, which produces copper sulfate, vigorously carried out technological innovation, combining the three processes of purification, granulation, and oxidation of miscellaneous copper into one process, which not only shortened the production process, but also reduced the copper consumption quota by 25%, and also improved the insecticidal effect of copper sulfate.

Now, various agricultural tool machinery factories are rushing to produce products for this winter and next spring. Major factories in Hangzhou, Ningbo and other places are also trial-producing 44 new varieties such as small tractors and small hydro generators. (Attached picture)
