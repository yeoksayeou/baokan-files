Jinan, November 11 (By our Newspaper) – The situation in commune-run industries in Shandong, like on all other fronts, continues to surge. Since the beginning of autumn, commune-run industries have vigorously supported the fight against drought and supplied a large number of tools for the "Three Autumns" production. Now, they are actively rushing to produce tools needed for the large-scale "water, fertilizer, and soil" campaign in winter. According to statistics from Feicheng, Zhangqiu, and three other counties in the Jinan area, more than 24,000 pieces of various water conservancy construction tools, more than 500 tons of cement, and 400 tons of explosives have been produced.

Commune-run industries were established on a large scale after October last year. First piloted in Gaotang County, commune-run industries then sprung up all over the province like mushrooms after a rain. More than 58,000 commune-run factories of a certain scale, including machinery, electricity, sand casting, processing, brewing, iron and wood, sewing, flour, and small-scale steelmaking, ironmaking, and coal washing, have been established, forming a preliminary "native industry network" covering the entire province. These commune-run industries, based on the principle of "small-scale operation during the busy farming season and large-scale operation during the slack farming season," do not occupy many laborers year-round, with a total of 500,000 people in the province, accounting for about 2% of the rural able-bodied labor force. These factories, built simply with local methods, according to the policy of commune-run industries serving agricultural production and the spirit of not competing with large industries for raw materials, utilize local materials, produce locally, and develop production using natural resources and wild raw materials. Since July, more than 4.9 million large-scale tools for the "Three Autumns" have been manufactured. From September 1st to 25th, they rushed to produce 1.2 billion catties of native fertilizer and 29 million catties of native pesticides. The number of small farm tools has nearly doubled compared to the same period last year; calculated on the basis of the average population participating in agricultural production in the province, each person has basically reached one hoe, sickle, shovel, and mattock.

Encouraged by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, commune factories in various places, focusing on the current needs of production and life, launched a competition centered on technical innovation, planting red flags, setting up pacesetters, and finding competitors everywhere. The workers of the farm tool factory of Matou Commune, Tancheng County, Linyi Prefecture, worked hard and diligently, and after eleven trials, finally successfully trial-produced a light and deep-plowing plow. 18,000 units were quickly promoted throughout the district, saving approximately 80,000 labor days per day in autumn plowing and planting, effectively promoting the autumn planting campaign. The workers of the Linyi City Heye Commune Machinery Factory, striving to catch up, used fried steel to successfully trial-produce a sweet potato harvesting plow, which is more than twenty times faster than manual labor.

The competition movement centered on technical innovation has rapidly pushed commune-run industries to a new stage. Currently, there are more than 9,000 farm tool manufacturing and repair factories in the province, with more than 9,000 precision machine tools and locally-made machine tools, and more than 20,000 red stoves. Of the 19 million large and small farm tools planned for production in the third quarter in the province, 76.5% of the iron materials were produced by the communes themselves. According to statistics from five regions including Jining, Jinan, Changwei, Linyi, and Liaocheng, the power generation capacity of commune-run small power stations has reached more than 7,000 degrees. In counties and cities such as Gaotang, Wulian, Licheng, and Linyi, many communes have been able to manufacture mechanical tools. Many of the tasks that farmers used to perform manually are now replaced by simple machinery. For example, threshing has threshing machines, cutting sweet potatoes has slicers, grinding flour has power mills, and lifting water has power pumps. Most of the "Three Autumns" tools manufactured this autumn are simple machines. For example, there are 250,000 three-to-five-row seeders, more than 90,000 large and small rubber-wheeled carts, more than 1,700 sets of irrigation and drainage machinery, and 140,000 sweet potato slicers with a daily cutting capacity of more than 10,000 catties. This autumn, the area of wheat sown in Shandong Province increased by more than 18 million mu compared to last year, and late autumn crops also increased by more than 10 million mu compared to last year. Due to the role of the above-mentioned new improved tools, the speed is more than twice as fast as last year, and the quality has also been generally improved compared to last year, and the labor shortage has been alleviated.

However, in the process of consolidating and improving commune-run industries, we also encountered opposition from a small handful of right-leaning opportunists. They used various excuses to slander commune industries. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, various places implemented the Party's call for opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, selecting pacesetters, holding on-site meetings of commune-run industries, criticizing right-leaning thoughts, and quickly launched a mass inspection and summary of commune-run industries from top to bottom throughout the province. This year, the total industrial output value of Wulian County is expected to reach more than 20 million yuan, an increase of thirty-six times compared to the advanced cooperative in 1957. According to inspections in counties such as Gaotang, Wulian, Linyi, Tai'an, and Licheng, since the people's communes have vigorously developed industry, the industrial output value of many communes accounts for more than 20% to 30% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. In the face of a large number of facts, right-leaning opportunists had to shut their mouths.

Currently, Party committees at all levels are systematically summarizing the experience of commune-run industries and formulating development plans for next year.

    山东社办工业为农业服务
    制造大量农具农药化肥支援秋收秋种
    突击生产冬修水利积肥运输各种器材
    本报济南11日电　山东各地公社办工业和其他各个战线上的形势一样，继续高涨。入秋以来，社办工业大力支援了抗旱斗争，并大量供应了三秋生产工具，现在又积极赶制冬季大搞“水肥土”所需要的工具。据济南地区肥城、章丘等五个县统计，已生产出各种水利施工工具二万四千多件，水泥五百多吨，炸药四百吨。
    社办工业是去年10月后大办起来的。首先在高唐县试点，接着全省社办工业就像雨后春笋般地兴建起来。机械、电力、翻砂、加工、酿造、铁木、缝纫、面粉以及小型的炼钢、炼铁、洗煤等等具有一定规模的社办工厂达五万八千多处，初步形成一个遍布全省的“土工业网”。这些社办工业根据农忙小搞，农闲大搞的原则，常年占用的劳力并不多，全省共五十万人，约占农村整半劳力的2％。这些因陋就简土法上马的工厂，根据社办工业为农业生产服务的方针，按照不与大工业争原料的精神，就地取材，就地生产，利用自然资源和野生原料发展生产。从7月以来，制造了大型的三秋工具四百九十多万件。从9月1日到25日，赶制了比较精细的土化肥十二亿斤，土农药二千九百万斤。小农具比去年同期增加将近一倍；按全省参加农业生产的人口平均计算，已基本上达到每人锄、镰、锨、镢各一件。
    在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，各公社工厂围绕当前生产生活需要，展开了以技术革新为中心的对手赛，到处插红旗、树标兵，找对手。临沂专区郯城县马头公社农具厂的工人们，苦学苦钻，经过十一次试验，终于试制成功轻便深耕犁。全区迅速推广了一万八千部，在秋耕秋种中，每天可节省劳动日约八万个，有力地促进了秋种运动。临沂市和阳公社机械厂的工人们，奋起直追，他们利用炒钢试制成功一种甘薯收刨犁，比人工快二十多倍。
    以技术革新为中心的竞赛运动，把社办工业迅速推向新的阶段。现在全省九千多处农具制造修配厂，有精密机床和土制机床九千多部，红炉二万多盘。第三季度全省计划生产的一千九百万件大小农具，有76.5％的铁料是公社自己生产的。据济宁、济南、昌潍、临沂、聊城等五个地区统计，社办小型电站的发电能力已达七千多度。高唐、五莲、历城、临沂等县市，有许多公社已经能制造机械工具。过去农民靠双手操作的工作，如今已有许多项目代之以简易的机械。如脱粒有了脱谷机，切甘薯有了切片机，磨面有了动力磨，提水有了动力抽水机等等。今秋制造的三秋工具，大部分都是简易机械。例如三至五行播种机有二十五万部，大小胶轮车九万多辆，排灌机械一千七百多部，日切万斤以上的甘薯切片机十四万部。今秋山东全省种麦比去年增加一千八百多万亩，晚秋作物又比去年多一千多万亩，由于上述新式改良工具发挥了作用，速度比去年快一倍多，质量也比去年普遍提高，劳力紧张情况已经得到改善。
    但是，在整顿和提高社办工业的过程中，也曾遇到一小撮右倾机会主义分子的反对。他们用各种借口来污蔑公社工业。八届八中全会以后，各地都贯彻了党的关于反右倾、鼓干劲的号召，选择标兵，召开社办工业现场会议，批判右倾思想，迅速在全省范围内，从上而下展开了一个群众性的社办工业大检查、大总结。今年五莲县工业总产值预计将达到二千多万元，比1957年高级社时增长三十六倍。据高唐、五莲、临沂、泰安、历城等县检查，人民公社大办工业以来，有许多公社工业产值占工农业总产值的20％到30％以上。在大量的事实面前，右倾机会主义分子不得不闭住嘴巴。
    现在，各级党委正系统地总结社办工业的经验，制定明年的发展规划。
