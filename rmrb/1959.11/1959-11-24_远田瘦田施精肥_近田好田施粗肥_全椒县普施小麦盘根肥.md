Apply Concentrated Fertilizer to Distant, Barren Fields; Apply Coarse Fertilizer to Nearby, Good Fields
Quanjiao County Universally Applies Basal Fertilizer to Wheat

(Reported by this newspaper) People's communes in Quanjiao County, Anhui Province, are seizing the favorable opportunity before the frost to rush-apply basal fertilizer to wheat.

The 372,000 mu of wheat in Quanjiao County are generally sprouting uniformly and growing vigorously, generally reaching about four inches in height and are currently at the stage of basal root development and tillering. In order to ensure that the wheat seedlings safely overwinter and grow healthily, the vast numbers of cadres and commune members are advancing victoriously and rapidly engaging in a wheat field management campaign centered on the large-scale application of basal fertilizer. The Quanjiao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to this work. At the end of the autumn planting season, it held consecutive meetings, proposing to all areas the requirement of applying more than 100 dan of fertilizer per mu before winter and the battle cry of "cover each mu with a round of fertilizer to let the wheat seedlings be clothed and covered"; responsible comrades of the county committee also went to the grassroots level to provide guidance and assistance. Under the specific guidance and assistance of the county committee, party organizations at all levels quickly convened cadre meetings and meetings with experienced farmers, organized the masses to conduct extensive and in-depth discussions, and after practical investigation and research, unanimously believed that applying basal fertilizer to wheat has four major benefits: (1) promoting the development of basal roots and the growth of wheat seedlings, increasing effective tillering before the end of the year, and ensuring rapid greening and vigorous growth next year; (2) preventing frost and freezing to ensure the safe overwintering of wheat seedlings, while increasing soil fertility to meet the fertilizer needs of wheat after greening; (3) eliminating the small number of Category III seedlings, so that poor seedlings can quickly catch up with the good and strong seedlings in winter; and (4) helping to increase yield per unit area.

Based on past experience and the actual situation this year, various areas generally adopt the method of applying basal fertilizer based on observing the seedlings and the fields: (1) For early-sown, well-growing, high-yield fields, universally cover with a layer of pond mud (more than 300 dan per mu), applying and spreading at the same time, both applying fertilizer and inhibiting the small number of wheat seedlings with a tendency to overgrow, thereby ensuring safe overwintering; (2) For better-growing, high-yield fields and large areas of fertile fields, apply pond mud or a combination of miscellaneous fertilizer and animal manure. Cover with pond mud near the ponds, and apply about 200 dan of smoked fertilizer, local miscellaneous fertilizer, and some animal manure per mu far from the ponds to promote basal root development and tillering; (3) For late-sown wheat and wheat in newly reclaimed wasteland that is growing smaller, quickly apply a round of fast-acting fertilizer (15 to 20 dan of human waste, poultry and livestock manure, and soil-based fertilizer per mu) to promote rapid growth and catch up with the good, large, and strong seedlings in winter, and not allow Category III seedlings to emerge. In the process of applying fertilizer, each commune also flexibly grasps the situation according to the soil quality, distance, and fertilizer source of each field, so that more fertilizer is applied to barren fields, less fertilizer is applied to fertile fields, concentrated fertilizer is applied to distant and poor fields, coarse fertilizer is applied to good and nearby fields, and pond mud is applied to fields near the ponds. At the same time, priority is given to applying fertilizer to poor seedlings, applying fast-acting fertilizer first, and then applying pond mud, to ensure high fertilizer efficiency.

Because the leadership is determined and the masses are enthusiastic, coupled with large-scale comparisons and competitions, the campaign to apply basal fertilizer is being carried out vigorously throughout the county. As of November 11, more than 164,000 mu of land in the county had been fertilized once, and more than 18,700 mu had been fertilized twice. Every mu of wheat seedlings has taken on a new look.

    远田瘦田施精肥　近田好田施粗肥
    全椒县普施小麦盘根肥
    本报讯　安徽全椒县各地人民公社抓紧冻前有利时机，突击追施小麦盘根肥。
    全椒县三十七万二千亩小麦，普遍苗齐苗旺，一般都长到四寸左右，正在盘根分蘖。为了确保麦苗安全越冬，生长健壮，广大干部和社员乘胜前进，迅速投入了以大追小麦盘根肥为中心的麦田管理运动。中共全椒县委对这项工作十分重视。在秋种结束时就连续召开会议，向各地提出每亩冬前施肥一百担以上的要求和“每亩盖上一交肥，让麦苗穿衣盖被”的战斗口号；县委负责同志并分头深入基层进行指导和帮助。各级党组织在县委的具体指导和帮助下，迅速召开了干部会、老农座谈会，组织群众进行广泛深入的讨论，并经过实际调查研究，一致认为追施小麦盘根肥有四大好处：（一）促进盘根和麦苗生长，增加年前有效分蘖，保证明年返青 快、生长旺；（二）防霜防冻保证麦苗安全过冬，同时增加地力满足小麦返青后的肥料需要；（三）消灭少数三类苗，使差苗迅速在冬季赶上好苗壮苗；（四）有助于单位面积产量的提高。
    根据以往经验和今年实际情况，各地一般采取看苗、看田追施盘根肥的办法：（一）对早播、生长好的高额丰产田，普遍盖一交塘泥（每亩三百担以上），做到边追边散，既追了肥料，又使少数有过苗趋势的麦苗得到抑制，从而保证安全越冬；（二）对生长较好的丰产田和大面积的肥田，塘泥或杂肥、畜肥结合追施。靠塘近的盖塘泥，离塘远的每亩追施二百担左右的熏肥、土杂肥和部分畜肥，促进盘根分蘖；（三）对生长较小的晚茬麦、新垦荒地的小麦，迅速追施一次速效肥（每亩人粪尿、家禽家畜肥和土化肥十五至二十担），促进迅速生长，在冬季赶上好苗、大苗和壮苗，不准三类苗露头。在追肥过程中，各公社还根据每块田的土质、远近和肥源情况，灵活掌握，做到瘦田多施、肥田少施、远田差田施精肥、好田近田施粗肥、靠近塘边田施塘泥，同时先施差苗、先施速效肥、后施塘泥，保证肥料效果高。
    由于领导决心大，群众干劲足，加上大评比、大竞赛，因而大追盘根肥运动在全县范围内搞的热气腾腾。到11月11日止，全县追一交肥的已有十六万四千多亩，追肥二交的有一万八千七百多亩。亩亩麦苗都有了新的起色。
