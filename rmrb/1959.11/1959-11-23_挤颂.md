    Fujiatai is a mountain village in the distant suburbs of Beijing, a very ordinary mountain village. Now, the first impression it gives is: everything seems crowded.
    The courtyard we live in is a traditional courtyard house. Our five transferred cadres are crowded on the heated brick bed in the north room. The landlord, an old man, even comforted us, saying, "Before you came, seven people slept on this bed." Obviously, that was even more crowded. The worker comrades who came later to erect high-voltage power lines lived in the east room. In addition to a heated brick bed, they also put up two cots, packing the room full. The remaining south and west rooms were occupied by the landlord's two brothers, also with their families. Our courtyard is like this. All the courtyards in Fujiatai are like this. Ordinarily, crowding is not as good as spaciousness, but the hosts and guests of this mountain village welcome this crowding and are happy about it.
    During the Great Leap Forward last year: roads were built here, and the road builders needed housing, so they had to crowd in. Building roads is a good thing, so people are happy with this crowding. The western mountains here need to be afforested, and the afforestation team needs housing, so they have to crowd in. Afforestation is a good thing, so people are happy with this crowding. Now, the hydroelectric power station being built nearby needs to erect high-voltage lines, and the line workers need housing, so they have to crowd in. Erecting high-voltage lines is a good thing, so people are happy with this crowding. One Fengsha railway line is not enough to meet the transportation needs of industrial construction development here, so a second line is being built. This line will pass through Fujiatai, and these railway workers also need housing, so they have to crowd in. Building railways is a good thing, so people are happy with this crowding. After the communization, factories were established, canteens were set up, and nurseries were established, all of which required housing, so they had to crowd in. These are all good things, so people are happy with this crowding. Most of the crowding caused by these various reasons is temporary. However, in the past two years, the temporary situation has been constant. The road builders haven't left, and the afforestation team has arrived; the afforestation team has just left, and the high-voltage line erectors have arrived. People come and go, and the construction of the motherland and the appearance of the mountain village are flourishing day by day.
    Building roads means the road passes through the fields, squeezing out a bit of farmland. The high-voltage line towers squeeze out a bit of farmland. Afforestation requires seedlings, and the nursery squeezes out a bit of farmland. The railway will pass through here, and this will be a station. Small red flags are planted here and there on the hillside for surveying, and without being told, people know that this will also squeeze out a bit of farmland. We are engaging in communism, and we can only say that the cucumbers are just starting to bud, and there is still much work to be done. This mountain village is bound to be squeezed out a bit of farmland by this kind of construction. However, the people of Fujiatai are good at conquering nature. The farmland on this side gives way to railways and roads, but they find it back from the mountains. In recent years, the cultivated land has not shrunk but has expanded; the grain yield has greatly increased since the people's commune was established. Although some land has been "squeezed" out, the face of Fujiatai has been "squeezed" to be more beautiful, and it will definitely get better and better in the future. Therefore, the commune members love this kind of crowding and are happy with it.
    This kind of happiness comes from the bottom of their hearts. Before liberation, this mountain village was not crowded at all. Not only was it not crowded, but during the Japanese occupation, more than half of the houses were burned down, and even the shadows of people were scarce. The people of Fujiatai remember clearly that most of the houses in the village were rebuilt after liberation. New houses are built every year and every month. People who haven't been home for ten years will definitely not recognize that this noisy mountain village is the desolate place it once was. However, no matter how much and how fast it is built, it cannot keep up with the speed of construction and the pace of Fujiatai's progress, so it is still crowded.
    Indeed, this mountain village is crowded everywhere. There is a three-bay supply and marketing cooperative here, and people come and go all day long to buy things, so it's also crowded! Before liberation, there was no supply and marketing cooperative. Within dozens of miles, there was only one miserable peddler carrying a few pounds of sweets, carrying them around all day long, and never being crowded to buy. People then lived on wild vegetables. Wild vegetables included elm money, walnut spikes, willow leaves...etc. Who had ever eaten biscuits? Who had ever worn a nice outfit? You could only ask the rich peasants, the landlords, and the Kuomintang officials.
    Nearly two months before the autumn harvest, the landlord, an old man, greeted us. He swept his eyes over the north room. These three north rooms were originally his storage room and kitchen. Along the wall were sacks and earthenware jars filled to the brim, occupying most of the room. He said with great enthusiasm, the topic ranging far and wide, from ancient and modern times to the visible harvest, to the distribution method of the commune after rectification, and finally he got to the point, saying:
    "Comrades, after the autumn harvest, the grain and potatoes that I will be allocated, and the feed I need to store for the two pigs to get through the winter, will be quite a lot. These things take up space, so I can only put some of them in this room." His eyes could not hide his happiness, but he said apologetically: "At that time, you will be even more crowded!" Then he laughed heartily.
    This crowding is the boiling prosperity of life.
    This crowding is the bustling scene of construction.
    This crowding is a normal phenomenon of the Great Leap Forward.
    This crowding is a product of the implementation of the General Line.
    This crowding will be recorded in history, so that future generations can see how the Chinese Communist Party led 650 million people to build socialism with what speed and what energy.
    Of course, some people are worried about this crowding. Aren't the right-leaning opportunists clamoring that "things have been messed up"? Of course, some people are afraid of this crowding. Isn't imperialism spewing out poisonous slander? As far as our position is concerned, since history has destined us to squeeze out capitalism, whether they are worried or afraid, there is no way to stop our progress.
    On the night when the landlord, an old man, greeted us, I was writing this "Ode to Crowding" by the light of a kerosene lamp (obviously, after the high-voltage line is erected, the electric lamp will squeeze out this kerosene lamp in this remote mountain village), and I couldn't help but think of Lenin's famous saying about electrification. These shining days, for us, are no longer just hopes on paper, but completely tangible realities. This is the ode.

    挤颂
    巴波
    傅家台，是北京远郊的一个山村，是一个平平常常的山村。这样一个祖国极普通的偏僻山村，现在，给人第一个印象是：什么都显得挤。
    我们住的院子是个四合院。我们五个下放干部，挤在北房的炕上。房主人老大爷还安慰我们说：“在你们来以前，这个炕上睡的是七个。”很显然，那就更挤。比我们迟到一步的架设高压电线的工人弟兄，住在东房，除了一个炕以外，还搭了两个行军床，把个屋子挤得满满的。剩下的南房、西房，就是房主人两弟兄，也是两家人。我们住的院子是这样。傅家台所有的院子都是这样。挤，按常情讲，总不如宽敞好；可是，这个山村的主人和客人，都欢迎这样的挤，都高兴这样的挤。
    去年大跃进：这里修公路，修公路的人要有房子住，只有挤；修公路是好事，人们高兴这样的挤。这里的西山要绿化，绿化大队要有房子住，只有挤；绿化是好事，人们高兴这样的挤。如今附近兴修的水电站要架设高压线，架线工人要有房子住，只有挤；架设高压线是好事，人们高兴这样的挤。有了一条丰沙线，还不能适应这里工业建设发展的运输问题，正在着手兴建第二条线路，这条线要穿过傅家台，这些铁道工人也要房子住，只有挤；修铁路是好事，人们高兴这样的挤。公社化后，办工厂，搞食堂，设托儿所，都要房子，只有挤；这些都是好事，人们高兴这样的挤。这些各样原因形成的挤，其中临时性的挤占多数。不过，这两年，临时性不断。修公路的没走，绿化的来了；绿化的刚去，架高压线的来了。人们来来去去，祖国的建设，山村的面貌，也就日新月异的繁荣起来了。
    修公路，公路从地里穿过，挤掉一点粮田，高压线的架子，挤掉一点粮田。绿化要树苗，苗圃挤掉一点粮田。铁路要从这里穿过，这里将是一个车站，山坡上这里那里都插着测量的小红旗，不说人们也知道，这也要挤掉一点粮田。我们闹共产主义，只能说黄瓜才起蒂蒂，事情有得干，这个山村难保不被这样那样的建设挤掉一点粮田。然而傅家台的人们，都是征服自然的好手。这边的粮田让路给铁路公路了，却从山地上再找补回来。几年来，耕地不是缩小了，而是扩大了；粮食的产量，打从人民公社化以后，比过去更是大大地增加了。虽然“挤”了一些地，但是却把傅家台的面貌“挤”得更加美好，而且以后一定越来越好。所以，社员们都爱这种挤，高兴这种挤。
    这种高兴，是打心眼儿里发出来的。解放前，这个山村可一点儿也不挤，不仅不挤，在日本鬼子时代，房屋被烧掉了一大半，连人影儿都稀少了。傅家台的人们都记得清清楚楚，村里的房屋，一大半都是解放后重建起来的。新房年年盖，月月盖，十年不回家的人，准认不出这个喧闹的山村就是当年荒凉的处所。可是，盖得再多再快，也赶不上建设的速度，赶不上傅家台往前奔跑的脚步，所以，还是挤。
    的确，这个山村到处都挤。这里有个三开间的供销合作社，买东西的人整天人来人往，也挤！解放以前，那时没有什么供销合作社，方圆几十里，只有一个可怜巴巴的货郎担，有那么几斤糖果，成天担来担去，从来没有被挤着买。人们那时是用野菜过日子。野菜包括榆钱、核桃穗子、柳树叶子……等等。谁吃过饼干呢？谁又穿过一身好衣服呢？只有去问富农，问地主，问国民党的官吏。
    离大秋将近两个月，房主人老大爷就向我们打招呼了。他扫了北房一眼。这三间北房，原是他的储藏室、厨房。沿墙放着装得满满的麻袋、瓦缸等等，把屋子占了一大半。他兴致勃勃地说，话题扯得老远，从上下古今谈到眼见的丰收，谈到经过整顿以后公社的分配办法，最后他才点题说：
    “同志，大秋后，我分到的粮食、土豆什么的，还有，要给两口猪存点过冬的饲料什么的，这些东西不少，又占地方，只有放些在这屋里。“他的眼光掩饰不住自己的高兴，他却歉然地说：“那时候，更要挤你们了！”接着，他爽朗地笑了。
    这种挤，是生活的沸腾繁荣。
    这种挤，是建设的热火朝天。
    这种挤，是大跃进的正常现象。
    这种挤，是总路线贯彻过程的产物。
    这种挤，历史上将要大书特书，让后代子孙们看到：中国共产党领导着六亿五千万人民，是用什么样的速度、什么样的干劲建成社会主义的。
    当然，这种挤，也有人发愁。右倾机会主义分子不是大叫“搞糟了”么？当然，这种挤，也有人恐惧，帝国主义不是大喷诬蔑的毒液么？至于从我们的立场说，既然历史注定了我们要挤垮资本主义，他们发愁也罢，恐惧也罢，是没有什么办法能阻挡我们的前进的。
    在房主人老大爷向我们打招呼的这天晚上，我就着煤油灯（很显然，高压线架好以后，在这偏僻的山村，电灯将要挤掉这煤油灯），写着这篇“挤颂”，不禁联想到列宁关于电气化的名言。这样闪光的日子，在我们来说，已经不是什么纸上的希望，而是完全可以捉摸的现实了。是为颂。
