From afar,
〔Sudan〕Hussein Osman Mansour

From afar, from a distant land,
I brought my luggage,
Hoisted my sails,
Heading to that lovely place.
My only ration is a smile,
My heart is filled with thousands of hopes,
Hoping for peace, hoping for friendship,
Hoping to gain happy times.
My sleepless eyes,
Kissed every part of the people's faces,
Kissed that noble land.
My dreams have come true,
Those brilliant wishes have become reality.
In the Great Hall of the People,
Behind the red flag,
Sit the struggling people,
They are dignified, passionate, and joyful.
They sing the praises of the past,
And distant memories.
They spread friendship
With words of happiness.
People's lips express all kinds of wishes,
Hoping the whole world lives in a peaceful nest,
Children around the nest,
Covering the rug with petals.
Liu Shaoqi sings the sweetest song of friendship,
He is like a great artist,
Playing a peaceful melody,
Children holding flowers rush forward like a flock of little doves.
Applause thunders, filling people's hearts,
Playing the music of happiness, friendship—the people.
My eyes stare at the red five stars,
Tears flow excitedly non-stop.
The dreams of all ethnic groups,
Like the paradise life said by ancient prophets,
Were written in beautiful myths,
In ancient caves,
With the brush of fantasy,
Today concentrated in the Great Hall of the People.
Concentrated all the heroes and warriors,
Today, dreams have become reality,
Moving silence has become the best language.
My eyes touched Mao Zedong's gaze,
Touched every smiling face,
I filled the cup of friendship with love,
This is the festival of friendship and peace,
This is the time of joyous gathering.
The Great Hall of the People is like a wine glass,
The glass is filled with the wine of the sea of people.
Ah, this paradise of life,
Was once described by Karl Marx,
Was once proclaimed by the foundations of Leninism.
They narrate a story,
This story was a crime yesterday,
Today it has become the world's example.
At that time, there were only twelve of them,
Yes, the number was small,
But they were the sparks that started a prairie fire.
In a corner of Shanghai,
They whispered,
Enveloped by the haze of danger.
Under the trembling light,
They were writing and studying plans.
On the Long March,
They marched with majestic steps.
In their minds, the red flag kept waving,
It is the soul, and people protect it with their lives.
Dawn finally came,
They became millions of working people,
Riding elf-like swift horses,
Tying the reins of struggle,
Like a rolling flood,
Rushing down from the top of the mountain,
Under the illumination of six hundred million candlelight,
They were laughing.
The Great Hall of the People is filled with a festive scene,
This is the laughter of victory, the most glorious victory.
This nation is holding its head high,
The workers have a unified goal,
The ranks are neat,
Under the banner of the hammer and sickle,
Fighting to the death, heroic and invincible,
They are olive branches, and also raging fire,
Chinese teenagers, the most valuable capital!
I bring you the salute of the sons and daughters of workers and peasants.
My feelings use my heart's juice to write these words,
It is a part of my life,
It is the flower of my struggle,
I write it in poetry.

    来自远方
    〔苏丹〕侯赛因·奥斯曼·曼苏尔来自远方，来自遥远的地方，带了我的行装，扬起了我的风帆，奔赴那个可爱的地方。我唯一的干粮是微笑，我的心中怀有千万个希望，希望和平，希望友情，希望获得幸福的时光。我的熬夜的眼睛，吻过了人们面容的各部分，吻过那高贵的土地。我的梦想已经实现，那些光辉的愿望已成现实。在人民大会堂里，在红旗的后边，坐着斗争的人民，他们又尊严又热情又欢欣。他们歌颂着过去，和遥远的回忆。他们用幸福的字句，传布着友谊。人们的嘴唇上表现各种愿望，希望全世界在和平的窠中生活，孩子们在窠的四周，用花瓣铺成绒毯。刘少奇唱起最甜蜜的友谊之歌，他像一位伟大的艺师，奏着和平乐曲，孩子们捧着鲜花像一群小鸽跑向前去。掌声雷动，充满人们的心房，奏着幸福、友谊——人民之曲。我的眼睛凝视着红的五星，泪水兴奋得流个不停。各民族的梦想，像古代先知所说的天堂生活，曾在美妙的神话里，在古老的山洞里，用幻想的笔墨写成，今天在人民大会堂集中。集中了所有的英雄和战士，今天，梦想变成了现实，动人的缄默变成最好的话语。我两眼触到毛泽东的目光，触到每副微笑的面庞，我用热爱斟满了友谊之杯，这是友谊和平的节日，这是喜聚的时光。人民大会堂像一只酒杯，杯里洋溢着的美酒——人的海洋。啊，这人生的乐园呀曾为卡尔·马克思所描绘，曾为列宁主义基础所宣扬。他们叙述着一个故事，这故事昨天还是犯罪行为，今天已经变成世界的榜样。那时他们只有十二个，是啊，人数不多，但他们却是燎原的星星之火。在上海的一个角落里，他们在低声耳语，笼罩着他们的，是那危险的阴霾。在颤动的灯光下，他们在写字、研究计划。在长征途中，他们迈着雄壮的步伐。在脑海里，红旗不停招展，它是灵魂，人们用生命保护它。黎明终于来了，他们变成了百万劳动人民，骑着精灵般的快马，系着斗争的缰绳，像滚滚的洪水，由山顶冲击而下，在六亿烛光辉照耀下，他们在欢笑。人民大会堂充满节日的景象，这是胜利的欢笑，——最光荣的胜利。这个民族在扬眉吐气，工人们目标一致，队伍整齐，在锤子和镰刀的旗帜下，拼死斗争，英勇无敌，他们是橄榄枝，又是烈火，中国的少年们，最宝贵的资本！我给你们带来了工农儿子的敬礼。我的感情用我的心汁写出这些话语，它是我生活的一部分，是我奋斗的花朵，我把它写在诗句里。
