    Overfulfill Grain and Cotton Procurement
    Properly Arrange People's Livelihood
    Party committees at all levels, while focusing on procurement work, correctly implemented the distribution policies for communes, production teams, and members from three important aspects: collection, management, and use.
    (Reported from Chengdu on the 9th) Sichuan has achieved a decisive victory in the procurement of agricultural products. As of the 7th, the province had completed 100.17% of its grain procurement task, with an increase of 49.27% in storage compared to the same period last year; the unified cotton purchase task had been completed 105.5%, with the storage progress more than two months ahead of last year. The quality of grain and cotton stored in various places is very good, with more than 90% of the grain meeting the standards of medium to high quality; the quality of most cotton has also improved by one grade compared to last year, and grading is accurate, verification is correct, procedures are clear, and figures are accurate.
    The successful completion and overfulfillment of grain and cotton procurement tasks in Sichuan Province was achieved on the basis of overcoming serious disasters and achieving a bumper harvest. After the bumper harvest of grain and cotton, party committees at all levels focused on product procurement from the very beginning in conjunction with production. The enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members to sell agricultural products to support national construction was unprecedented in terms of momentum, speed, and quality. During the peak period of grain storage, there were as many as five million grain transportation workers in the province every day, with more than 200 million catties of grain being stored daily; during the peak period of cotton storage, one to two million people were delivering cotton every day, with more than 40,000 dan of cotton being stored daily.
    One of the important experiences for Sichuan Province in successfully completing and overfulfilling grain and cotton procurement tasks is to adhere to putting politics in command and conduct in-depth ideological education to oppose rightism and encourage greater effort. Adhering to the mass line and launching a vigorous mass movement is the second important experience for the province in successfully completing and overfulfilling grain and cotton procurement tasks. During the concentrated grain and cotton procurement storage period, all localities, based on the principle of "combining internal and external forces, and cooperating with each other," mobilized the enthusiasm of the vast number of financial and trade cadres on the one hand, and fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the peasant masses on the other. Various places also launched red flag competitions for selling grain and cotton. At the same time, in the competition, various places also organized forces to help backward areas catch up with advanced areas, so that the province's procurement work could develop in a balanced manner.
    In the work of grain and cotton procurement, various places in Sichuan Province earnestly implemented the state's grain and corn procurement policies in accordance with the principle of taking into consideration the interests of the state, the collective and individual. Party committees at all levels, while focusing on procurement work, arranged the people's livelihood from three important aspects: collection, management, and use, combining grain procurement and grain distribution. In terms of distribution, communes and production teams were generally given sufficient seeds, food rations, and fodder according to the prescribed standards; at the same time, people's communes universally increased vegetable cultivation, and the province's 590,000+ public canteens ensured that each person ate one to two catties of vegetables every day. The masses firmly believe that public canteens can guarantee their lives, which further encouraged the upsurge in grain sales. Before completing the procurement task, Nanchong Prefecture established 76,969 warehouses, formulated ten management methods for commune management area grain, and equipped them with full-time custodians. Therefore, after the autumn harvest, all communes in the prefecture achieved the goals of storing before expenditure, calculating before eating, planning grain use, and having records of inflow and outflow, eliminating waste and loss. In the main cotton producing areas, when purchasing cotton, arrangements were also made for retained cotton for self-use according to the prescribed standards, which greatly promoted the enthusiasm of the masses in selling cotton.
    At present, all localities are continuing to do a good job in finishing the grain and cotton procurement work. Areas that have completed the procurement task are actively arranging the lives of commune members and organizing forces to carry out a general grain storage survey, clarifying the situation, verifying inventory, ensuring the safety of state and commune grain storage, and at the same time, actively doing a good job in sweet potato harvesting, storage, and processing. Areas that have completed the unified cotton purchase task are also striving for greater surpluses under the premise of implementing policies, carrying out a mass "small autumn harvest" movement, and ensuring that cotton is picked cleanly and returned to the home.

### 超额完成粮棉征购  妥善安排群众生活

    四川正确执行国家、集体、个人兼顾原则
    超额完成粮棉征购
    妥善安排群众生活
    各级党委一边抓征购工作，一边从收、管、用三个重要环节，对公社、生产队和社员正确实行了分配政策。
    本报成都9日电　四川农产品收购工作已获得决定性胜利。截至7日为止，全省粮食征购任务已完成100.17％，比去年同期入库量增49.27％；棉花统购任务已完成105.5％，入库进度比去年提前了两个多月。各地入库的粮食、棉花质量都很好，90％以上的粮食符合上中等标准；绝大部分棉花的品质也比去年提高了一个等级，并做到分等不乱、验级正确、手续清楚、数字确实。
    四川省粮食、棉花收购任务的胜利完成和超额完成，是在战胜严重灾害、夺得丰收的基础上取得的。粮、棉大丰收后，各级党委结合生产，一开头就抓紧产品收购。广大公社社员交售农产品支援国家建设的爱国热情声势之大、进度之快、质量之好，都是空前的。粮食入库高潮时期，全省运粮大军每天有五百万人之多，每天入库粮食达二亿斤以上；棉花入库高潮期间每天也有一、二百万人送棉，每天入库棉花四万担以上。
    四川省胜利完成和超额完成粮食、棉花收购任务的重要经验之一是坚持政治挂帅，深入进行反右倾、鼓干劲的思想教育。坚持群众路线，大搞群众运动，是全省胜利完成和超额完成粮、棉征购任务的重要经验之二。在突击粮、棉征购入库期间，各地本着“内外结合、共同协作”的原则，一方面调动了广大财贸干部的积极性，一方面又充分调动了农民群众的积极性。各地并纷纷展开了出售粮、棉的红旗竞赛运动。同时，在竞赛中，各地还组织力量帮助后进地区赶上先进地区，使全省收购工作平衡发展。
    在粮、棉收购工作中，四川省各地根据国家、集体、个人兼顾原则，认真贯彻了国家的粮、棉收购政策。各级党委一边抓征购工作，一边又从收、管、用三个重要环节上安排群众生活，把粮食征购和粮食分配工作结合起来。在分配方面，一般都按规定标准给公社、生产队留足种籽、口粮、饲料；同时各人民公社普遍增种蔬菜，全省五十九万多个公共食堂做到了每人每天吃一斤到二斤蔬菜，群众坚信公共食堂能够保障自己的生活，更加鼓舞了售粮热潮。南充专区在征购任务完成前就建立了仓库七万六千九百六十九处，订出公社管理区粮食十大管理办法，配备了专职保管员。因此专区各公社秋收后都做到了先入库后开支、先算后吃、计划用粮、进出有据，杜绝了浪费损失现象。各棉花主要产区，在收购棉花时，也按规定标准安排了留用棉自用，大大促进了群众售棉的积极性。
    现在，各地还在继续做好粮棉收购的扫尾工作。已完成征购任务的地区，正在积极安排好社员生活，并组织力量，开展储粮普查，摸清情况，核实库存，确保国家和公社储粮安全，同时，积极作好红苕收、藏、加工工作；已完成棉花统购任务的地区，也在贯彻政策的前提下，力争更大超额，大搞群众性“小秋收”运动，作到把棉花拾干拣净、朵絮还家。
