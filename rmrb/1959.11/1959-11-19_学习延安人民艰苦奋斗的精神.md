Learn from the Spirit of Hard Struggle of the People of Yan'an
    Xue Yonglin

In the first year after the people's communes were established, revolutionary holy land Yan'an sent news of a bumper harvest: the total output value of grain, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery from January to September increased by 21% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. Such encouraging achievements were obtained by the heroic people of Yan'an through hard struggle.

Hard struggle and overcoming difficulties are the glorious traditions that the people of Yan'an have always maintained in their revolutionary struggle and construction, and they are the fundamental guarantee for continuous victories. In the most difficult years of our revolution, the people of Yan'an demonstrated unparalleled heroism, sparing no sacrifice, fearing no difficulties, mobilizing outstanding children who accounted for about one-tenth of the total population to participate in the revolutionary war, and working diligently, saving food and clothing, and using one-fifth of all income to support the revolutionary war.

In socialist construction, the people of Yan'an followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." They not only continued to maintain the fine tradition of hard struggle, but also carried it forward even more. They did not show weakness in the face of difficulties, nor were they arrogant or slack after victories. They always maintained vigorous ambition and launched a heroic and tenacious struggle against nature. Especially in the favorable situation of the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes in 1958, the people of Yan'an were even more energetic and high-spirited, and achieved even more brilliant achievements. Last year and this year have become one of the regions with the largest increases in Shaanxi Province. This year, the average agricultural population of the entire region produced 1,029 kilograms of grain, more than double that of 1952. What a remarkable thing this is! In the struggle against nature, the people of Yan'an never wavered when encountering difficulties. Relying on self-reliance and hard work, they overcame one difficulty after another. In the construction of the Yanhui Canal, the ability to achieve self-sufficiency in twelve important items such as cement, lime, and gunpowder is a concrete manifestation of this heroism. After obtaining a bumper harvest, they still remained simple and frugal, saving food and clothing, collecting a large amount of wild vegetables, and saving grain as much as possible, treating good days as poor days, and supporting national construction and the people of fraternal regions with a large amount of grain and various agricultural and sideline products, fully demonstrating the noble communist style of the old revolutionary base areas.

The people of Yan'an have been able to maintain the fine tradition of hard struggle, not only because of the objective reasons that the land in this area is barren and poverty leads to change, but mainly because of the long-term and continuous education of the broad masses of the people by the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Party organizations in the Yan'an area. After the national liberation, the Party educated cadres and the masses in a timely manner, carrying forward the spirit of hard struggle in the revolutionary war, carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction, acting as pioneers in the struggle against nature, and constantly encouraging the people of Yan'an to boost their energy and establish the idea of continuous revolution. After the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes last year, they criticized complacency, which enabled the surging energy of the broad masses to continue, laying the ideological foundation for continued leap forward this year. After encountering some difficulties in the construction process, the Party educated cadres and the masses not to succumb to difficulties, but to rely on hard struggle, self-reliance, and overcome difficulties. After obtaining a bumper harvest, it timely carried out education on building the country diligently and thriftily, managing households diligently and thriftily, practicing thrift, and eliminating waste. Over the years, the cadres in the Yan'an area have always adhered to the simple and plain style of eating, living, and working with the masses, which has also profoundly educated the broad masses. This series of ideological work by the Party has played an extremely important role in the people of Yan'an continuing to carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle.

The natural conditions in the Yan'an area are very poor, and this year it has suffered from drought, floods, frost, hail, insects and other disasters, yet it has still achieved such a large harvest. The people of Yan'an, who hold high the red banner of hard struggle, were our role models in the past, and they are still our role models today.

    学习延安人民艰苦奋斗的精神
    薛永林
    在人民公社化后的第一年，革命圣地延安传来了大丰收的消息：粮食和林牧副渔1至9月的总产值，比大跃进的1958年同期增长了21％。这样令人振奋的成绩，是英雄的延安人民经过艰苦奋斗获得的。
    艰苦奋斗，战胜困难，是延安人民在革命斗争和建设事业中始终保持的光荣传统，也是不断取得胜利的根本保证。在我国革命最艰苦的年代里，延安人民表现出了无比的英雄气概，不惜任何牺牲，不怕任何困难，动员了约占总人口十分之一的优秀子弟参加了革命战争，并且辛勤劳动，节衣缩食，把全部收入的五分之一支援革命战争。
    在社会主义建设中，延安人民遵循着毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的指示，不但继续保持了艰苦奋斗的优良传统，而且更加发扬光大，在困难面前不示弱，在胜利面前不骄傲，不松劲，始终保持着旺盛的志气，向大自然展开了英勇的顽强的斗争。特别是在1958年大跃进和人民公社化的大好形势下，延安人民更是干劲冲天，斗志昂扬，获得了更加光辉的成就。去年和今年都成为陕西省跃进幅度最大的地区之一，今年全专区每个农业人口平均生产了一千零二十九斤粮食，比1952年增加了一倍以上。这是多么了不起的事情啊！延安人民在向自然斗争中，遇到困难，从不气馁，依靠自力更生，埋头苦干，战胜了一个一个的困难。在兴修延惠渠中，能够做到水泥、白灰、火药等十二个重要项目的自给，就是这种英雄气概的具体表现。在获得大丰收后，仍然艰苦朴素，省吃俭用，大量采集野菜，尽量节约粮食，把富日子当穷日子过，把大量的粮食和各种农副产品，支援国家建设和兄弟地区的人民，充分表现了老区人民所具有的崇高的共产主义风格。
    延安人民能够始终保持艰苦奋斗的优良传统，除了由于这个地区土地贫瘠，穷则思变的客观原因外，主要是党中央、毛主席和延安地区党组织长期地不断地对广大人民群众进行教育的结果。全国解放以后，党适时地教育干部和群众，发扬革命战争中艰苦奋斗的精神，进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，充当向大自然斗争的先锋，使延安人民不断鼓起了干劲，树立了不断革命的思想。去年大跃进和人民公社化后，由于他们对自满情绪进行了批判，因而使广大群众的冲天干劲一直保持下来，奠定了今年继续跃进的思想基础。在进行建设中碰到某些困难后，党又教育干部和群众，不要向困难屈服，依靠艰苦奋斗，自力更生，战胜困难。在获得丰收后，又适时地开展勤俭建国、勤俭持家的教育，厉行节约，杜绝浪费。延安地区的干部，多年来始终坚持和群众同吃、同住、同劳动的艰苦朴素作风，也深刻地教育了广大群众。党的这一系列的思想工作，对延安人民继续发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，起了极其重要的作用。
    延安专区的自然条件很差，今年又遭受旱、涝、霜、雹、虫等灾害的侵袭，还获得了这样大的丰收。高举艰苦奋斗红旗的延安人民，过去是我们学习的榜样，今天仍然是我们学习的榜样。
