桂剧 (Gui Opera), although one of China's older opera genres, was nearly withered before liberation due to the enemy's long-term destruction. After liberation, under the nurturing of the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom" policy on opera, it was able to escape death and be reborn. In recent years, it has once again put forth buds, sprouted new branches, and displayed its splendor in the garden of Chinese opera art.

Gui Opera's famous actress, Yin Xi, is someone we are all very familiar with. Her "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" can not only be called a work with an established reputation, but it has also been made into a film. Judging from the repertoire of this public performance, whether it is the daring and enterprising Hong Niang, the loyal and devoted Li Xiangjun, Wang Guiying who sacrifices her son for righteousness, or the tender and gentle Bai Suzhen, she can appropriately, yet uniquely, complete the creation of these characters. For example, the role of Meng Da'mei in "Beacon Fires on the Red River" should be a new challenge for her! The play reflects the struggle life before and after liberation, and the Meng Da'mei she plays is also a very brave Zhuang girl, but her performance is still very endearing.

"Sacrificing the Son" and "The Trial" are repertoires that many opera genres have. The characteristics of these two Gui Opera plays mainly lie in the performance. Jiang Jinkai, who plays Liu Yanchang in "Sacrificing the Son," is a famous Laosheng (old male role) in Gui Opera. His singing, acting, reciting, and dancing are not only rigorous, disciplined, and meticulous, but also fiery and profound, which are the impressions he left on me. I don't know why, but seeing his performance always makes me involuntarily think of Mr. Zhou Xinfang. I also know that these are two different opera genres, and their performances are indeed based on different foundations and have their own strengths. But I always feel that there is a similarity between them. For example, the three words "steady, accurate, and ruthless" are common requirements in opera performance, but in their performances, they make me understand the meaning of these three words more concretely and deeply.

Jiang Jinliang, who plays Qin Can in "The Trial," is also one of the rare painted-face roles in Gui Opera. After his appearance, although there are only three or four movements such as "covering his face," blowing his beard, flipping his sleeves, and shaking his sleeves, the atmosphere of the entire audience has become chilling, making people tremble. When Qiu'er is dragged out, facing the timid child kneeling on the ground, he glares fiercely. He lies his whole body flat on the table, and at the same time blows his beard and shakes his sleeves. This movement is called "Hungry Tiger Pouncing on a Sheep." Seeing this, one cannot help but understand the meaning of the name, causing a shock to the soul. The deaf and dumb act after hearing Liu Yanchang's debate, and the fierce, ruthless, and vicious arrogance when beating Qiu'er, all more profoundly reveal Qin Can's brutal nature like a tiger and wolf, and all more prominently highlight the theme of the play: that there is power without justice, and there is brutality without humanity.

"A Zhuang Brocade" is one of the most locally characteristic repertoires brought by the Gui Opera Troupe this time. In the past days of tears and blood mixed with rice, the Zhuang people endured the layers of oppression and bullying from emperors, bureaucrats, and landlords. Although they gasped under the tyranny of the rulers of past generations, they never gave up their yearning for a better future life. "A Zhuang Brocade" is precisely a symbol of the people's beautiful yearning. The Zhuang old woman Da Bu is a skilled Zhuang brocade weaver. She wants to use hair, sweat, and blood, she wants to use strong will and unyielding determination, to weave the life scene in the Zhuang people's ideal into the brocade. It is said that as long as this brocade is woven, the Zhuang people will obtain the ideal happy life. The brocade was woven, but unfortunately, it was snatched away by the demon king. The heroic Zhuang people, of course, are not willing to give up. So, Da Bu's youngest son, Le Re, inherited the will of his mother – the Zhuang people, and after all kinds of hardships, finally killed the demon king and retrieved the brocade. From then on, the Zhuang family became a paradise on earth, and even the fairies in the sky lingered and did not want to leave. What a wonderful imagination! In this imagination is immersed how much strong perseverance! This Zhuang brocade, symbolizing the people's ideal, can of course only be woven today, and only truly be woven today under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.

This is a Zhuang folk tale with strong mythological characteristics, and it is not easy to adapt it into a Gui Opera and to adapt it well. However, looking at the whole play, you will feel that it not only uses the characteristics of Gui Opera's singing and reciting arrangements, but also unreservedly absorbs the expressive techniques of Zhuang folk songs; it not only writes the details with deep affection, gentle and moving, but also skillfully uses "xieyi brushwork" (freehand brushwork) in the big picture. This "rough in the fine, fine in the write" brushwork makes the connection between reality and mythology smooth and seamless, and makes the difference between Gui Opera and the form of legend get a clever compensation. This is a gratifying gain.

Among them, Qin Caixia, who plays Da Bu, is one of the most promising Dan (female role) in Gui Opera. She is still young, but her artistic achievements are noteworthy. Her singing is mellow and has charm, her performance is delicate, pure, and clean. No matter what role she plays, she is always meticulous and serious in creating. Liu Wanchun, who plays Le Mo, is a famous clown in Gui Opera. Hu Lina, who plays Le Re, and Liao Yanyi, the Wu Dan (female martial role) in "Opening the Bow and Drinking Tea" and "Performing Fire Sticks," are all young actors who have newly grown up in Gui Opera. Their performances have been praised by the audience.

    老树新枝现异彩
    吴琼
    桂剧，虽然是我国较老的剧种之一，但在解放前，由于敌人的长期摧残，已几近枯萎；解放后，在党的“百花齐放”的戏曲政策抚育之下，才得绝处逢生。近年来，她已重含细蕾，另发新枝，再现异彩于祖国戏曲艺术的百花园中。
    桂剧名演员尹羲，这是我们大家早就熟习的了。她的“拾玉镯”不仅可谓世有定评的佳作，并且摄成了影片。从这次公演的剧目看来，无论是敢作敢为的红娘，肝胆照人的李香君，舍子全义的王桂英，还是柔情似水的白素贞，她都能恰如其分的，但又别具特点的完成这些人物的创造。即如“红河烽火”中的蒙大妹一角，对她说来应该是个新的课题吧！剧本反映的是解放前后的斗争生活，她所饰演的蒙大妹，又是一个颇为勇敢的僮家姑娘，但是她的表演仍是令人喜爱。
    “舍子”“打堂”这是好多剧种都有的剧目。桂剧这两折戏的特点，主要在表演上。饰“舍子”中刘彦昌的蒋金凯，是桂剧中久享盛名的老生，他的唱、做、念、舞除了严谨、规矩、一丝不苟之外，火爆、深沉是他留给我的概括印象。不知为甚么，看到他的表演，总是使我不自禁的想到周信芳先生，我也知道这是两个不同的剧种，他们二位的表演又确乎各有所本，各有所长。但我总感到他们之间确有异曲同工之妙。比如稳、准、狠三字，本是戏曲表演中的共同要求，可是在他们二位的身上，却使我对这三个字的意义理解的更加具体，更加深切了。
    饰“打堂”中秦灿的蒋金亮，也是桂剧中不可多得的花脸之一。他出场后，虽然只有“掩面”、吹须、翻袖、抖袖等三四个身段，全场的气氛却已为之寒气凛冽，令人心颤了。秋儿拖到了，面对着胆怯的，跪在地下的孩子，他恶狠狠的逼视。他把全身都平卧在桌子上，并且同时吹须、抖袖。这个身段的名字叫做“饿虎擒羊”，看到此处，真不禁令人顾名思义，惊魄悬心了。闻听刘彦昌辩论后的装聋做傻，棍打秋儿时的凶、狠、毒、辣的气焰，都更加深刻地揭示了秦灿虎狼其性的残暴性格，都更加突出了有强权无公理，有残暴、无人情的剧本主题。
    “一幅僮锦”是桂剧团这次带来的最具地方特点的剧目之一。在过去那些血泪拌饭的日子里，僮族人民忍受皇帝、官僚、地主们的层层压榨、欺凌。他们虽然喘息在历代统治者们的淫威之下，却从未放弃过对于未来美好生活的向往。“一幅僮锦”正是人民这种美好向往的象征。僮族老妇人妲布，是一个编织僮锦的能手，她要用头发，汗珠和鲜血，她要用坚强的意志和不屈的决心，把僮族人民美好理想中的生活图景，编织在僮锦上。据说只要这幅僮锦一织成，僮族人民便可获得理想中的幸福生活了。僮锦织成了，不幸却为妖王抢走。英雄的僮族人民，当然不肯就此罢休。于是，妲布的小儿子勒惹，秉承了母亲——僮族人民的意志，历尽艰辛，终于杀了妖王，夺回僮锦。从此，僮家便成为人间的乐园，甚至天上的仙女也为此而流连忘返了。这是一个多么美妙的想像啊！在这想像里面又浸沉着多么坚强的毅力呀！这幅象征人民理想的僮锦，当然只有今天才能织成，只有在党与毛主席的领导下的今天才真正的编成了。
    这是一个僮族的民间传说，神话的特点很浓，要把它改编成为桂剧，并且要改的好，并不容易。然而通观全剧，你会感到，它既运用着桂剧唱、念安排上的特点，又毫不拘谨地吸取着僮族民歌的表现手法；它既在细微处写的那样情深似水，娓娓动人，又能在大处得心应手的运用着“写意之笔”。这种“粗中有细，细中有写”的笔法，使现实与神话之间，衔接的平整、不露痕迹，使桂剧与传说形式之间的差别，得到了巧妙的弥补。这是一个可喜的收获。
    其中饰演妲布的秦彩霞，是桂剧中最有希望的旦角之一。她的年龄还轻，可是在艺术上的成就却是引人注意的。她的唱工圆润而又有韵味、她的表演细腻、纯厚而又干净。无论饰演任何角色，她都是那样一丝不苟，始终严肃的进行创作。扮演勒墨的刘万春，是桂剧中的名丑。扮演勒惹的胡利娜与“开弓吃茶”“演火棍”中的武旦廖燕翼，都是眼前桂剧中新成长起来的年轻演员，他们的表演都受到观众的赞扬。
