How to Store Chinese Cabbage
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Vegetables

This year, northern provinces have generally had a bumper harvest of autumn Chinese cabbage, and the planting area has also generally increased. It is estimated that the total output of Chinese cabbage in various regions will increase by one to two times compared to last year. In order to ensure a bumper harvest, the current issue is: to continue our efforts and strive to complete the arduous tasks of harvesting, processing, and storing autumn vegetables brought about by the large bumper harvest of autumn vegetables.

Here we will discuss the technical issues of Chinese cabbage storage.

Northern provinces are accustomed to planting Chinese cabbage on a large scale and also have rich experience in storing Chinese cabbage. Although the forms of storage cellars vary from place to place, they can be summarized into two forms: cellar storage and burial storage. Cellar storage has ventilation equipment and is generally suitable for storage with a longer supply period. Cellar storage allows for retrieval at any time, but building cellars requires a large amount of wood, sorghum stalks, and other materials, and the management is quite labor-intensive. Burial storage, on the other hand, is the opposite. It does not require any materials and does not require frequent management. As long as the technology is mastered, the burial location is well chosen, and harvesting and burying are done at the appropriate time, it can be stored for a certain period. This year, Chinese cabbage is generally abundant, requiring a large amount of storage. Under the condition that materials such as wood are relatively scarce, the burial method can be tried.

Cellar Storage

(1) Build cellars in a timely manner. The time when Chinese cabbage is harvested is around "Start of Winter." This season often has severe frosts. Building the cellar in a timely manner can ensure that the Chinese cabbage enters the cellar in a timely manner.

Maintaining a certain temperature and humidity suitable for Chinese cabbage storage is the central issue of management during the entire storage period. Chinese cabbage cellars generally do not have special ventilation or heating and dehumidifying devices. They only rely on the opening and closing of the skylights and cellar vents left when building the cellar to control the temperature and humidity inside the cellar. Therefore, the selection of the cellar location, direction, and determination of the ventilation area (that is, the size of the skylights and vents) are of particular importance.

The cellar should generally be built in a place with a low water table, high and dry ground, and good air circulation. This can avoid excessive humidity inside the cellar and facilitate ventilation management. More cellar vents should be left. The depth of the cellar should be determined according to local natural conditions. In the suburbs of Beijing, it is appropriate to use a vegetable cellar with three feet and five inches above and below ground. In Heilongjiang Province, a completely underground cellar is required to maintain the temperature inside the cellar in the cold season. In areas south of Beijing, storage cellars should gradually be changed to above-ground types, otherwise the cellar temperature will be too high. The thickness of the soil covering the cellar roof also varies from region to region.

Materials such as wood used for building cellars can be obtained locally. The experience of using sorghum stalk bundles instead of wood as cellar purlins when building cellars in Tangshan, Hebei, is very good.

(2) Do a good job of preparing before entering the cellar.

First of all, you should choose Chinese cabbage varieties that are resistant to storage for storage. There are great differences in storage resistance between varieties. For example, the Xiaobaikou Chinese cabbage in Beijing is not a storage-resistant variety. If it is mistakenly used for storage, it will cause great losses during the storage period.

Secondly, attention must be paid to harvesting at the right time. The Chinese cabbage prepared for storage should be harvested a few days earlier than the cabbage eaten at that time, because the Chinese cabbage should have a period of drying in the field before entering the cellar. If the harvest is too late to dry, it will cause losses during the storage period.

When harvesting Chinese cabbage, the tops should all be turned north to allow for drying in place. The drying time can be three to six days depending on the weather, turning it over once in the middle.

After the Chinese cabbage is dried, it must also be torn. The purpose of tearing is to select good cabbage without diseases and insect pests for storage in the cellar. Tearing off rotten leaves and yellow leaves can also avoid mutual transmission of diseases and cause rot after entering the cellar.

(3) It is essential to grasp the appropriate timing for entering the cellar. Entering the cellar too early leads to excessive temperature and humidity, which is prone to rot and loosening. Entering the cellar too late and being frozen will also cause losses. The appropriate time for entering the cellar is generally when the cellar temperature drops to around 0 to 1 degree Celsius. It is advisable to enter the cellar in the morning, evening, and at night when the cabbage temperature is low. Generally, stacking storage is used inside the cellar. The cabbage is stacked along the north-south direction, with one layer of roots facing east and one layer of roots facing west, until it reaches near the top of the cellar. Sorghum stalks are erected at the north and south ends to prevent the cabbage from falling down. A wind path about the length of one cabbage should be left between the cellar wall and the two rows of cabbage. A three-foot aisle should be left on one side of the cellar for management and turning the cabbage.

Although the above stacking method has many advantages, it is prone to rot due to the tight stacking, poor ventilation, and excessive temperature and humidity between the cabbage piles, and the cabbage must be turned frequently. In addition to the above stacking method, there are many good experiences in various places. Beijing Agricultural University once experimented with storing Chinese cabbage on shelves, reducing the number of cabbage turns to two during the entire storage period, greatly saving labor and reducing losses. The method of stacking one layer of adobe and one layer of Chinese cabbage in Anyang, Henan, also has a similar effect. However, these methods of storing cabbage require more materials. The "elevated stacking" method created by the Zhanghua Vegetable Station of the Beijing Vegetable Company in 1957 is a better one. Using this method can extend the interval between cabbage turns and reduce losses, while requiring few materials.

(4) Management after entering the cellar. The storage period of Chinese cabbage is as long as six to seven months. During the entire storage period, the outside temperature changes greatly. In Beijing, the average maximum and minimum temperatures from November to April differ by about 30 degrees Celsius. However, storing Chinese cabbage requires human control to maintain the cellar temperature between 0 and 2 degrees Celsius and the humidity between 85% and 95%. How to maintain the temperature and humidity in the cellar? It is mainly controlled by ventilation and turning the cabbage.

Pit Burial

The technical key to burial can be simply summarized as the following points:

(1) The burial site for Chinese cabbage should be selected in a high, dry, sandy soil. The burial site should also be oriented north-south to avoid uneven humidity on the north and south sides of the pit.

The specifications of the cellar should be adapted to local conditions. The principle is: according to the local natural conditions, using different pit depths, wall thicknesses, and backfilling to appropriately utilize the soil temperature so that the temperature inside the pit can be stably maintained at around 0 to 2 degrees Celsius.

In Beijing, Dalian, Kaifeng, Luoyang, and other places, the pits dug for burial are not deep, about one-half the height of the Chinese cabbage (five inches to one foot). The height of the backfill is the same as the depth of the pit, so that the Chinese cabbage is more than one inch above the soil after being placed in the pit, and the Chinese cabbage is level with the soil after backfilling.

In the Northeast, burial can be changed to underground, and the backfill can be thickened, or sorghum stalks, vegetable leaves, etc. can be added to the soil to enhance insulation.

(2) The cellar pit should be dug early and exposed to the sun for a few days to make the pit dry and suitable for storage. The buried Chinese cabbage will not be turned over and managed after entering the cellar, so preparations should be fully made before entering the cellar.

First of all, the varieties of Chinese cabbage for storage should be strictly selected. It is easy to cause losses if varieties that are not resistant to storage are buried in a dead cellar. The good cabbage referred to here is cabbage that is not very tightly closed. Because the Chinese cabbage is in close contact with the soil during the burial period and still grows slowly, the cabbage that is not very tightly closed can continue to close during this period; the cabbage that has already closed tightly often cracks during burial.

The buried Chinese cabbage only needs to have the outer leaves, yellow leaves, and rotten leaves torn off, and does not need to be treated as strictly as cellar-stored cabbage. In order to properly maintain the normal temperature and humidity during the burial period, the drying of Chinese cabbage must be strengthened. Generally, the drying time for cabbage is longer than that for cellar-stored cabbage, and it can only enter the cellar after drying well. The roots of the buried Chinese cabbage should be cut off.

(3) The time for burying Chinese cabbage into the cellar is stricter than that for cellar storage. The time for burying into the cellar is generally later than that for cellar storage. It is most suitable to carry out when the topsoil has frozen, but can still thaw slightly at noon.

Before stacking the cabbage at the bottom of the cellar pit for burying Chinese cabbage, it is best to spread a layer of reeds or large pieces of leaves to reduce the rooting of the Chinese cabbage and prevent cracking. A layer of reeds and leaves can also be spread on top of the Chinese cabbage so that the backfilled soil does not stick to the cabbage leaves when it freezes, and the Chinese cabbage will not be damaged when digging soil to take the cabbage.

Backfill immediately after entering the cellar. The experience of Beijing farmers is that it is advisable to backfill once on the premise of drying the cabbage. Some areas also use the method of backfilling in stages.

(4) The buried Chinese cabbage should also be checked frequently. If serious rot is found, it should be dealt with early.

    怎样贮藏白菜
    中国农业科学院蔬菜研究所
    今年北方各省秋白菜普遍丰收，而且播种面积也普遍增加，预计各地白菜总产量将比去年增加一倍至二倍。为了保证丰产丰收，当前的问题是：再接再厉，努力完成由秋菜大丰收而带来的繁重的秋菜收获、加工和储存的任务。
    这里我们谈一下白菜贮藏的技术问题。
    北方各省习惯于大面积种植白菜，同时也对白菜的贮藏有着丰富的经验。贮藏窖的形式虽因地而异，但总结起来不外两种形式：窖藏和埋藏。窖藏有通风设备，一般适用于供应期较长的储存。窖藏可以随时取用，但建窖需要大量木材、秫秸等材料，并且管理相当费工；埋藏则正相反，可以不用任何材料，也不需经常管理，只要掌握技术，选好埋藏地点，适期收获埋藏就可以储存一定时间。今年白菜普遍丰收，需要大量贮存，在木料等材料相对地感到缺乏的条件下，埋藏的方法可以试用。
    建窖储藏
    （一）及时建窖。白菜收获的时候，正是“立冬”前后，这个季节常有严重的霜冻，及时把窖建好，才能保证白菜入窖及时。
    保持适于白菜贮藏的一定温度、湿度，是整个贮藏期间管理的中心问题。白菜窖一般没有特殊通风或加温降湿的装置，只是依靠建窖时留出的天窗和窖眼的开关来控制窖内的温度、湿度。因而选择建窖地址、方向和确定通风面积（也就是天窗和窗眼的大小）就有着特殊重要的意义。
    建窖一般宜选择地下水位较低、高燥而空气畅通的地方。这样可避免窖内湿度过大和便于通风管理。窖眼应多留些。窖的深浅应根据各地自然条件决定。北京近郊以采用地上、下部各三尺五寸的菜窖为合适。在黑龙江省，则需采用完全地下式窖才能在严寒季节保持窖内温度。在北京以南地区，贮藏窖则应逐渐改为地上式，否则会形成窖温过高。窖顶复土厚度，也因地区而异。
    建窖用的木材等材料，可以就地取材。河北唐山建窖，用秫秸捆代替木材做窖檩是很好的经验。
    （二）做好入窖前的准备工作。
    首先应选用耐藏的白菜作为贮藏之用，品种间耐藏性差异是很大的，如北京的小白口白菜是不耐藏的品种，如果误用来贮藏，将会造成贮藏期间很大损失。
    其次必须注意适时收获，准备贮藏的白菜，应该比当时吃的菜早收几天，因为白菜在入窖前应该有一段在田间晾晒的时间，如果收获过晚来不及晾晒，会造成贮藏期间的损失。
    白菜收获时要使顶部一律向北倒，以便就地晾晒。晾晒时间可根据天气晒三至六天，中间倒翻一次。
    白菜晾晒以后还要进行撕菜。撕菜的目的是选出没有病虫害的好菜入窖贮藏。撕去烂叶、黄叶，还可以避免入窖后互相传病造成腐烂。
    （三）入窖必须掌握适时，过早入窖温、湿度过高，易腐烂脱帮；过迟受冻也同样造成损失。入窖的适期，一般在窖温降至摄氏零度到一度左右。入窖宜在早晚和夜间白菜菜温较低时。窖内一般采用堆藏，沿南北方向码菜，一层根向东，一层根向西，一直码到接近窖顶，南北两端竖立秫秸以免菜倒下，在窖墙和两行菜中间都应留下约有一棵菜长的风路。在窖的一侧留三尺走道，以便管理和倒菜。
    上面的码菜方法，虽有不少优点，但因堆积较紧，通风较差，菜堆间温度、湿度过高，容易引起腐烂，并且必须经常倒菜。在上面码菜方法以外，各地还有不少好的经验。北京农业大学曾试验白菜上架贮藏，使整个贮藏期间倒菜次数减少到两次，大大节省了人工，还减少了损耗。河南安阳的一层土坯、一层白菜的堆藏方法，也有近似的效果。但是用这些办法储菜，都需要较多的材料。1957年北京市菜蔬公司彰化菜站创造的“架空码菜”的方法是比较好的一种。用这种方法，可以延长倒菜间隔时间，降低损耗，同时所费材料不多。
    （四）入窖后的管理。白菜贮藏期长达六—七个月。在整个贮藏期中，外界温度变化很大。北京市11—4月平均最高、最低温度就相差三十度上下。但贮藏白菜却需要用人力控制窖内温度为零度到二度，湿度为85％到95％之间。怎样保持窖内温、湿度呢？主要是通过放风和倒菜来控制。
    挖坑埋藏
    埋藏的技术关键，简单的说，可归纳为以下几点：
    （一）埋藏白菜的窖址应选高燥、沙性土为好。窖址也宜采用南北方向，以避免坑内南北面湿度不一。
    窖的规格因地制宜，原则是：根据当地自然条件以不同的坑深、墙厚、复土，恰当地利用土温，使坑内温度能稳定的保持在摄氏零度到二度左右。
    在北京、旅大、开封、洛阳等地，埋藏挖坑都不深，约为白菜高度的二分之一（五寸—一尺），上面培帮高度和坑深一样，使白菜放入坑后高出土帮一寸多，上土后白菜正和土帮相平。
    在东北埋藏则可改为地下式，并加厚复土，或在土上加盖秫秸、菜叶等加强保温。
    （二）窖坑应提早挖好，曝晒几天，以使坑内干燥，适于贮藏。埋藏的白菜在入窖以后就不再进行翻动管理，所以入窖前应该充分做好准备。
    首先应严格选择储藏白菜的品种。不耐贮藏的品种埋入死窖容易造成损失。这里所指的好菜，是结球不很紧的菜。因为埋藏期间白菜紧密接触土址，仍然缓慢生长，结球不太紧实的白菜在此期间还能继续进行结球；已结球紧实的白菜，在埋藏中常常发生裂球。
    埋藏的白菜只需撕去外叶、黄叶、烂叶，不必像窖藏菜那样严格处理。为适当保持埋藏期间正常温、湿度，白菜的晾晒必须加强。一般晒菜时间比窖藏的菜要长些，晒好才能入窖。埋藏的白菜要把根部砍去。
    （三）埋藏的白菜入窖的时间比窖藏更为严格。埋藏入窖时间一般较窖藏为晚。在表土已结冻，而中午仍能稍化时进行最适宜。
    埋藏白菜的窖底在码菜前，最好铺上一层苇子或大片的树叶，以减少白菜扎根和防止裂球。白菜上面也可以同样铺一层苇子、树叶，使复土冻结时不致粘住菜叶，挖土取菜也不致伤了白菜。
    入窖后即行复土，北京农民的经验是在晾菜的前提下，以一次复土为宜。有些地区也有采用分次复土方法的。
    （四）白菜埋藏后也应当经常进行检查，如发现较严重的腐烂现象，则应提早处理。
