Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 14th: Henan Province's large-scale winter water conservancy project has fully commenced. Based on the principles of unified planning and comprehensive management, the winter water conservancy project focuses on small-scale projects, combined with large and medium-sized projects. In the past month, mass-based small-scale water conservancy projects have completed over 200 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, constructed over 1,600 small reservoirs, over a million small canals, 210,000 water wells, over 30,000 pits, ponds, weirs, and dams, over 1,700 dug springs, and over 34,000 other projects.

    Henan Province's water conservancy construction this winter and spring focuses on the Yellow River, with comprehensive planning and management of the Huai River, Tang River, Bai River, Wei River, and other major rivers. Currently, the large reservoirs under construction with dam heights above 20 meters and water storage capacities above 100 million cubic meters, and the large canals irrigating over one million mu of land, include 14 projects such as the Yellow River Dagong Hongqi Canal, Qin Chang Communism Canal, and the Shahe Baiguishan Reservoir Irrigation Canal, Honghe Yangzhuang Reservoir Irrigation Canal, Xiaonanhai Reservoir, and Shahe Zhaopingtai Reservoir. There are 278 medium-sized canals and reservoirs with water storage capacities above 10 million cubic meters and irrigating over 10,000 mu of land. These reservoirs and canals include water conservancy hub projects such as ship locks, dams, power stations, and irrigation canals. The Yudong Zhou Shang Yong Grand Canal, running through Yongcheng, Shangqiu, and Zhoukou, and entering the Shahe River, has also been started and is continuing construction.

    To ensure that water conservancy projects are built quickly and well, various localities have adopted a policy of prioritizing indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign techniques, vigorously reforming and promoting advanced tools, and carrying out high-efficiency movements from the outset. Tanghe County in Nanyang Prefecture organized over 2,400 technicians to establish 76 tool factories, manufacturing 13,641 various new-style tools. Due to the large-scale manufacturing and adoption of various advanced tools, the average daily earth and stone work done by each worker on the water conservancy construction site in the entire prefecture increased from one cubic meter to 1.78 cubic meters.

    During the winter water conservancy work, relevant departments at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels have established specialized agencies to collect and transport various materials to support construction sites. Each county in Xinyang Prefecture established a materials supply office, and the county commercial departments, in addition to supplying over 1.7 million construction tools, also established 780 mobile shops at the construction sites. The Shangshui County Water Conservancy Construction Logistics Department organized over 3,300 iron and woodworking workers, carrying tools deep into the construction sites, and vigorously rushing to manufacture and repair tools using a zoned contract method. To ensure that the migrant workers are well-fed, warmly clothed, and have a good place to sleep, convoys of trucks loaded with grain, cement, lime, and daily necessities are now traveling daily on the transportation lines to the water conservancy construction sites throughout the province.

    Henan Province's water conservancy construction this winter is being carried out on the basis of the brilliant victory in combating drought to ensure a bumper harvest and drought-resistant wheat planting, and the in-depth implementation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. After the drought struggle, the vast number of cadres and masses deeply realized the great significance of water conservancy construction, and their enthusiasm for participating in the winter construction project is very high. As soon as the autumn planting work was completed, the people's communes organized a large number of people to go to the construction sites. Although the climate is gradually getting colder, the migrant workers at the construction sites are full of energy and are generally engaged in socialist labor competitions and technical innovation activities.

    大规模冬修水利工程全面展开
    河南一月完成两亿土石方
    修建小型水库一千多座、小渠道百多万条，挖井二十一万眼，以及其他工程六万多处。
    据新华社郑州14日电　河南省大规模冬修水利工程已全面展开。根据统一规划、全面治理的原则，冬修水利工程以小型为主，大中小型相结合。一个月来，群众性的小型水利工程已完成两亿多立方米土、石方，修建小型水库一千六百多座，小渠道一百多万条，水井二十一万眼，坑、塘、堰、坝三万多处，挖泉一千七百多眼，以及其他工程三万四千多处。
    河南省今冬明春水利建设是以黄河为重点，并对淮河、唐河、白河、卫河等主要河流进行全面规划，综合治理。目前，已经开工修建的坝高二十米以上、蓄水一亿立方米以上的大型水库与灌溉百万亩以上的大型渠道，有黄河大工红旗渠、秦厂共产主义渠和沙河白龟山水库灌渠、洪河杨庄水库灌渠、小南海水库、沙河昭平台水库等十四处；蓄水一千万立方米以上、灌溉万亩以上的中型渠道、水库二百七十八项。这些水库、渠道包括船闸、拦河坝、电站和灌溉渠等水利枢纽工程。贯穿永城、商丘至周口入沙河的豫东周商永大运河也已开工和继续修建。
    为了水利工程建设得又快又好，各地一开始就采取以土法为主，土洋结合的方针，大力改革和推广先进工具，开展高工效运动。南阳专区唐河县组织两千四百多名技工，办了七十六座工具厂，制造各种新式工具一万三千六百四十一件；由于大量制造和采用各种先进工具，全专区水利工地每个劳动力平均日做土、石方由一立方米提高到一点七八立方米。
    在冬修水利中，省、专区、县有关部门都成立了专门机构，采集和调运各种物资支援工地建设。信阳专区各县成立了物资供应办公室，县商业部门除供应了一百七十多万件施工工具外，还在工地成立了七百八十个流动商店。商水县水利建设后勤部组织三千三百余名铁木业工人，携带工具深入工地，用分片包干的方法大力赶制和修配工具。为了使民工吃饱、穿暖、睡好，现在全省通往水利工地的交通干线上，每天都有成群的满载着粮食、水泥、石灰和生活用品的汽车驰往工地。
    河南省今冬水利建设是在抗旱保丰收、抗旱种麦取得辉煌胜利和党的八届八中全会决议深入贯彻的基础上开展起来的。广大干部、群众经过抗旱斗争，深刻的体会到兴修水利的重大意义，参加冬修工程的积极性很高。秋种工作刚一结束，各人民公社就组织大批人力开赴工地。目前虽然气候渐冷，但工地民工干劲十足，普遍展开了社会主义劳动竞赛和技术革新活动。
