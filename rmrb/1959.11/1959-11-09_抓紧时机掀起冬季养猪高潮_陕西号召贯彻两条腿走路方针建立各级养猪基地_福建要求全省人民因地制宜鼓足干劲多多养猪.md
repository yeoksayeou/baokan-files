Grasp the Opportunity to Set Off a Winter Pig Raising Upsurge
Shaanxi Calls for Implementing the "Walking on Two Legs" Policy to Establish Pig-Raising Bases at All Levels
Fujian Demands People Throughout the Province to Raise More Pigs by Adapting to Local Conditions and Exerting Full Effort

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee recently held a provincial pig-raising work conference, calling on the people of the province to seize the great opportunity of winter pig-raising and immediately launch a pig-raising upsurge. The conference discussed the province's plans for developing pig production in the next two years.

Thanks to the strengthened leadership of Party committees at all levels, Shaanxi's pig-raising industry has seen great development. As of the end of September, the number of pigs raised in the province had reached over 2.59 million, an increase of 19% compared to the end of June, and 29.1% compared to the end of March.

The representatives at the meeting used vivid facts to illustrate the benefits of raising pigs. Raising a large number of pigs can not only meet market needs, support national economic construction, and increase the income of communes and members, but also provide high-quality fertilizer for farmland and increase crop yields. The Xiaoma Production Team of the Pujigong Commune in Xingping County applied more pig manure to the fields this year due to raising a large number of pigs. Coupled with other measures to increase production, the yield of wheat per mu increased by 91% compared to 1958, and corn increased by 45%. In the first half of this year, income from pig-raising accounted for 36.4% of the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations. The Fangta Production Team of the Gushan Commune in Shenmu County has always been a grain-deficient team due to poor soil, lack of fertilizer, and insufficient labor. After communization, they raised a large number of pigs, and now the average household has 5.3 pigs. Due to the abundance of pig manure and high yields, they have basically achieved self-sufficiency in grain.

The meeting used a large number of facts to refute the right-leaning conservative ideas that it is not good to develop pig-raising in plains, cities, and areas lacking experience. The Guanyinmiao Production Team of the Yongning Commune in the suburbs of Xi'an, which is both a plain and a city, has raised a large number of pigs under the leadership of cadres who have exerted great effort. From January to September this year, they raised a total of 1,278 pigs, and now have 342 pigs in the pens, averaging nearly one pig per mu. The pig farm of the Xiaoma Production Team of the Pujigong Commune in Xingping County was established in July last year. The breeders were all young girls. At that time, some people thought they had no experience and could not do it, but as a result, the pigs were raised very well. Now the pigs in this pig farm have grown from the original 130 to 2,156. The meeting also criticized the ideas of not raising a large number of pigs due to emphasizing insufficient funds, piglets, feed, and fear of swine fever. Through the efforts of the vast number of cadres and the people of the whole county, Zhenba County has overcome difficulties such as piglets and feed in every possible way, and has achieved a great leap forward in pig production. As of the end of September, the county had 79,707 pigs in the pens, averaging 2.1 pigs per household. The meeting widely exchanged experiences in collecting feed, feeding management, and epidemic prevention.

The meeting believed that there are many favorable conditions for completing the pig production targets for the next two years. First of all, inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, with the deepening of the movement to increase production and practice economy, the development of pig-raising is increasingly needed by the masses. Secondly, the people's communes and production teams have superior conditions for running collective pig-raising businesses on a large scale. Third, this year's bumper harvests of crops have created extremely favorable material conditions for raising a large number of pigs. Fourth, the province's more than 100 farms generally have pig farms. They not only have experience in collective pig-raising, but also have a certain number of specialized technical personnel and scientific research equipment, which will play a certain demonstration role for collective pig-raising in various places. In addition, all localities have retained enough sows and have established animal husbandry and veterinary work stations, veterinary hospitals, etc., providing a certain guarantee for the rapid development of pig-raising.

The meeting emphasized that Party organizations at all levels must strengthen leadership over the development of pig production and continue to implement the policy of simultaneously promoting public and private raising, and simultaneously promoting self-sufficient production and commodity production. Provinces, special districts, counties, and communes should all establish their own pig-raising bases according to needs and possibilities, and develop commodity production. All state-owned farms should become national bases for producing commodity pigs.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee held a telephone conference with the first secretaries of prefectural, municipal, and county Party committees on the evening of November 2, calling on the people of the province to take immediate action, rely on the strong strength of the people's communes, and launch a mass pig-raising upsurge to strive to achieve the great goal of one pig per person in the province next year.

The meeting pointed out that the development of pig production can not only increase the income of commune members, increase meat food for urban and rural people, and increase raw materials for light industry, but more importantly, it can provide a large amount of organic fertilizer for agricultural production and greatly promote the development of agricultural production. In the great leap forward in agriculture last year and the continued leap forward in agriculture this year, many local experiences have proved that: wherever the pig-raising industry is doing well, the fertilizer is solved well, and the production is particularly outstanding. The Shatou Red Flag Commune's Locomotive Brigade, which has been advancing under the red flag of pig-raising for several years, now raises an average of one and a half pigs per person. Due to the great development of pig-raising, the grain output of this team has doubled. The meeting emphasized that in order to strive for a continued leap forward in agriculture next year, the people of the province, especially the members of the people's communes, should go all out to raise pigs and accumulate fertilizer, and strive to achieve one pig per person in the province's rural areas next year. Due to good conditions and a small population, mountainous areas should have higher plans for developing pig production than coastal areas, and strive to exceed the requirement of raising one pig per person.

The meeting believed that the plan to achieve a great leap forward in pig production in the province is entirely possible. Since the implementation of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the number of pigs in the province has increased from more than 3.07 million in July to the current 3.51 million, and many advanced pig-raising units have emerged. For example, Changtai County has an average of four pigs per household, and the Shanzhen Brigade of the Guanqiao Commune in Anxi has achieved two pigs per mu. It can be seen that as long as the Party's leadership is strengthened, the superiority of the people's communes is fully utilized, right-leaning is opposed, and efforts are encouraged, the province's pig-raising plan can definitely be realized.

The meeting emphasized that in order to achieve a great leap forward in pig production, it is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of giving priority to collective breeding and combining public and private breeding, and to focus on collective pig breeding. Experience has proved that collective pig-raising is convenient for unified fundraising and labor arrangement, convenient for feeding management and engaging in capital construction, and can greatly improve the commodity rate of pigs. The meeting pointed out that while focusing on collective pig-raising, it is necessary to continue to encourage and support members to raise pigs individually. The meeting also gave instructions on striving to achieve full pregnancy of sows and increasing pig feed.

Finally, the meeting requested Party committees at all levels to take the quickest way to quickly convey and implement the spirit of the telephone conference to the production teams and the vast number of members; find out the advanced units and advanced experiences in developing pig-raising in the local area, hold on-site meetings and vigorously promote them, and launch a large-scale competition movement in pig production to compare with the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and learn from the advanced.

    抓紧时机掀起冬季养猪高潮
    陕西号召贯彻两条腿走路方针建立各级养猪基地
    福建要求全省人民因地制宜鼓足干劲多多养猪
    据新华社讯　中共陕西省委最近召开全省养猪工作会议，号召全省人民抓紧冬季养猪大好时机，立即掀起养猪高潮，讨论了今、明两年全省发展生猪生产的计划。
    由于各级党委加强领导，陕西省养猪事业有了很大发展。截至9月底，全省养猪头数已达二百五十九万多头，比6月底增长19％，比3月底增长29.1％。
    代表们在会议上以生动的事实说明了养猪的好处。大量养猪，不仅能够供应市场需要，支援国家经济建设和增加公社、社员收入，还可为农田提供优质肥料，提高农作物的产量。兴平县普集公社肖马生产队今年大量养猪，给农田多施猪粪，再加上其他增产措施，小麦每亩产量比1958年增加91％，玉米增产45％。今年上半年，养猪收入占农副业总收入的36.4％。神木县孤山公社房塔生产队，土质瘠薄，肥料缺乏，劳力不足，历来是个缺粮队，公社化后，大量养猪，现在平均每户有猪五点三头，由于猪肥多、产量高，粮食基本达到自给。
    会议用大量的事实驳斥了认为平川、城市和缺乏经验的地区不好发展养猪事业的右倾保守思想。既是平原又是城市的西安郊区永宁公社观音庙生产队，由于干部鼓足干劲，领导群众大量养猪，今年1至9月共养猪一千二百七十八头，除了卖出的以外，现在圈存三百四十二头，平均一亩地接近有一头猪。兴平县普集公社肖马生产队的养猪场，是去年7月办起来的，饲养员都是年青姑娘，当时有的人认为她们没有经验，办不成事，但是，结果猪养得很好。现在这个猪场的猪，已由原来的一百三十头发展到二千一百五十六头。会议还批判了强调资金、仔猪、饲料不足和怕猪瘟因而不大量养猪的想法。镇巴县经过广大干部和全县人民的努力，千方百计地克服了仔猪、饲料等困难，实现了生猪生产大跃进。截至9月底，全县圈存猪已达七万九千七百零七头。平均每户养猪二点一头。会上广泛地交流了采集饲料、饲养管理和防疫等方面的经验。
    会议认为，完成今、明两年的生猪生产指标，有很多有利条件。首先，在党的八届八中全会精神鼓舞下，随着增产节约运动的步步深入，发展养猪事业日益为群众所需要。其次，人民公社和生产队有优越的条件，可以大办集体养猪事业。第三、今年农作物丰收，给大量养猪创造了极为有利的物质条件。第四、全省一百多个农牧场，一般都有养猪场，他们不但有集体养猪的经验，而且有一定数量的专业技术人员和科学试验设备，这对各地集体养猪，会起到一定的示范作用。此外，各地都已留足母猪，还建立了畜牧兽医工作站、兽医院等，为迅速发展养猪事业提供了一定的保证。
    会议强调指出：各地各级党的组织必须对发展生猪生产加强领导，继续贯彻公养和私养同时并举、自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针。省、专、县、社，都应该根据需要与可能，建立自己的养猪基地，发展商品性生产。所有国营农场应该成为国家生产商品猪的基地。
    据新华社讯　中共福建省委在11月2日晚召开地、市、县委的第一书记电话会议，号召全省人民立即行动起来，依靠人民公社的雄厚力量，掀起一个群众性的养猪高潮，为实现明年全省一人养猪一头的伟大目标而奋斗。
    会议指出发展生猪生产，不仅能够为公社社员增加收入，为城乡人民增加肉食，为轻工业增加原料，尤其重要的是，它能够为农业生产提供大量的有机质肥料，大大促进农业生产的发展。在去年农业大跃进和今年农业继续跃进中，许多地方经验证明：哪里养猪事业搞得好，哪里的肥料就解决得好，哪里的生产也就搞得特别出色。几年来高举养猪红旗前进的沙县红旗公社火车头大队，现在平均每人养猪一头半，由于生猪大发展，这个队的粮食产量已经翻了一番。会议强调指出，为了争取明年农业继续跃进，全省人民特别是人民公社社员，都应鼓足干劲大搞养猪积肥，力争明年内全省农村达到一人一头猪；山区由于条件好、人口少，发展生猪生产的规划应该比沿海地区更高一些，争取超过每人养一头猪的要求。
    会议认为，实现全省养猪大跃进的规划是完全可能的。自贯彻党的八届八中全会决议以来，全省生猪头数已从7月份的三百零七万多头增加到现在的三百五十一万头，并出现了不少先进的养猪单位。如长泰县平均每户已养猪四头，安溪官桥公社山珍大队已实现一亩地两头猪。由此可见，只要加强党的领导、充分发挥人民公社优越性，反右倾，鼓干劲，全省养猪规划一定能够实现。
    会议强调，为了实现生猪生产大跃进，必须坚决贯彻以集体饲养为主，公私饲养并举的方针，大抓特抓集体养猪。经验证明：集体养猪便于统一筹集资金和安排劳力，便于饲养管理和从事基本建设，可以大大提高生猪的商品率。会议指出，在大抓集体养猪的同时，还要继续鼓励和支持社员个人养猪。会议对争取实现母猪满怀、增加猪饲料等问题也作了指示。
    会议最后要求各级党委采取最迅速的办法，把电话会议精神迅速传达贯彻到生产队和广大社员中去；找出当地发展养猪的先进单位和先进经验，召开现场会议大力推广，在生猪生产方面掀起一个比先进、赶先进、学先进的大规模竞赛运动。
