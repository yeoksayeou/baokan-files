Xinhua News Agency, October 31st: Yin Weichen, Director of the Huangtugang People's Commune in Fengtai District, Beijing, spoke today at the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in Industry, Transportation, Capital Construction, Finance, and Trade. He said: As a farmer, I wholeheartedly congratulate the comrades on their brilliant achievements and thank the Party and Chairman Mao for leading our people across the country in achieving the unprecedented great leap forward in socialist construction. I represent all members of the Huangtugang People's Commune in Fengtai District, Beijing, in congratulating the congress.

Yin Weichen said: Our Huangtugang People's Commune, like fraternal communes across the country, has a very good production situation. Under the leadership of the Party, all members have studied the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and are motivated with even greater vigor to continue the leap forward on the basis of last year's great leap forward. In 1959, the average yield per unit area of winter wheat in the commune was 253 jin, an increase of 68.6% compared to 1958. Early spring vegetables were harvested sixteen days earlier than last year, and major vegetables such as radishes, tomatoes, and large green peppers have achieved large-scale bumper harvests. Our commune mainly grows vegetables and produces other non-staple foods, while also vigorously developing commune-run industries. There are currently 26 factories, including a semi-automated sweet potato noodle factory, a farm tool repair shop, an internal combustion engine repair shop, brick making, basin making, rubber rolling, and vegetable processing. In addition, we also have a large-scale professional flower production team, which produces a large number of flowers, grass, and trees to supply the capital and other places in need. Our people's commune is becoming more and more beautiful every day. This is primarily due to the correct leadership of the Party, the soaring enthusiasm of all members, and the support from all sides, especially from the industrial production front.

After introducing the production and development of the Huangtugang Commune, Yin Weichen said: The great superiority of the people's commune is not only manifested in wheat planting, deep plowing, large-scale development of water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and development of sideline production, but also in the unified allocation of funds, rational planning of land, adoption of superior varieties and new technologies, and implementation of state plans, all of which demonstrate the powerful vitality and unparalleled superiority of the people's commune.

He said: The original Huangtugang Agricultural Cooperative, due to its small scale and insufficient funds, could not carry out major capital construction at all. Even a hand-operated sweet potato noodle factory required 300,000 yuan to achieve mechanization, which the agricultural cooperative, with its small scope, could not manage. Once the commune was established, this was resolved. In the second half of 1959, the semi-mechanized sweet potato noodle factory began production, with most of the manual labor replaced by machines, increasing efficiency by 1.5 times. Not counting the past, since the establishment of the people's commune, in the past year, we have added 94 relatively large electric water pumps, 5 tractors, 1 car, 50 horses, 60 steam-powered carts, and also built many factory buildings and production equipment, opening up broad prospects for ensuring continued great leap forward in production. He said: These agricultural machines and processing machines were created by your hard work. Thank you, worker comrades, for your active support.

Yin Weichen said: The benefits of the people's commune are endless. This can be seen from the overall production achievements, and how rapidly production has developed in this extraordinary year. The total income of our commune from January to July 1959 was 4.05 million yuan, an increase of 109% compared to the same period in 1958. The total vegetable production was 46 million jin, an increase of 21% compared to the same period in 1958. Diversified operations in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries have also made significant progress. The commune-run factories had only two factories during the advanced cooperative period, but now there are 26 factories; the total output value from January to August 1959 was 402,000 yuan, an increase of five times compared to the same period in 1958. The people's commune implements the principle of distribution according to work and the grain supply system. This is the largest social insurance, solving the problem of eating for the vast number of farmers. In the face of this year's severe flooding, no one worried about eating. The entire commune focused on production, overcoming disasters, and launching a competition for autumn vegetable bumper harvests.

Yin Weichen concluded: In order to ensure the continued great leap forward in agricultural production, all members are motivated with even greater vigor to strive to completely change the face of production within two years. We must learn from the worker elder brothers. You are accelerating socialist construction, and we guarantee to catch up closely. I represent all our members in assuring the congress that we must learn the vigor and determination of the heroes, work hard to improve agricultural production, increase vegetables, grain, and meat, and support national industrial construction. The Huangtugang People's Commune must take the lead, win the red flag, achieve full mechanization in two years, and transform the commune into a garden in five years.

    殷维臣在群英会上谈黄土岗公社的美景
    据新华社31日讯　北京市丰台区黄土岗人民公社主任殷维臣今天在全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会上讲话。他说：做为一个农民，我从内心里祝贺同志们所取得的光辉成绩，感谢党和毛主席领导我们全国人民取得了史无前例社会主义建设大跃进的伟大成就。我代表北京市丰台区黄土岗人民公社全体社员向大会祝贺。
    殷维臣说：我们黄土岗人民公社和全国各地兄弟公社一样，生产情况很好，在党的领导下，全体社员学习了党的八届八中全会的决议，鼓起了更大干劲，在去年大跃进的基础上，正在继续跃进。1959年全社冬小麦平均单位面积产量二百五十三斤，比1958年增加68.6％，早春蔬菜比去年提早十六天收获，小萝卜、西红柿、大青椒等主要蔬菜都获得大面积丰收。我们的公社以种植蔬菜和生产其他副食品为主，同时也大力发展了社办工业，现有半自动化粉丝工厂、农具修配厂、内燃机修配厂、制砖、制盆、轧胶、蔬菜加工等二十六个工厂，另外我们还有一个规模较大的鲜花专业生产队，每年生产大批花、草、树木供应首都和各地需要。我们的人民公社，一天比一天建设的更加美好了，这首先归功于党的正确领导，全体社员冲天的干劲和各个方面的支援，特别是工业生产战线上的支援。
    殷维臣在介绍黄土岗公社生产发展的情况之后说：人民公社的巨大优越性，不仅表现在种麦、深翻、大搞发展水利、积肥、开展副业生产等方面，在统一调配资金，合理规划土地、采用优良品种、新技术，执行国家计划各个方面也都显示出人民公社的强大生命力和无比的优越性。
    他说：原黄土岗农业社由于规模小、资金不足，根本不能进行重大的基本建设，就是一座手工操作的粉丝工厂，要实现机械化也需要三十万元，农业社范围小，办不到。一成立公社就解决了。在1959年下半年半机械化的粉丝厂就开始投入生产，使大部分的体力劳动都由机器代替了，提高效率一点五倍。以前不算，自建成人民公社到现在，一年来我们就添置了比较大型的电动抽水机九十四台，拖拉机五台，汽车一辆，马五十匹，汽轮大车六十辆，还新建了许多工厂厂房和一些生产设备，为保证生产继续大跃进开辟了广阔的前途。他说：这些农业机械、加工机械都是你们亲身劳动创造出来的，感谢工人同志对我们的积极支援。
    殷维臣说：人民公社的好处说不完，从总的生产成绩就可以看出，在这不平凡的一年里，生产发展的是多么迅速。我们公社1959年1—7月的总收入四百零五万元，比1958年同期增加109％，蔬菜总产量四千六百万斤，比1958年同期增产21％。农林牧副渔多种经营也有显著发展。社办工厂高级社时只有两个厂子，现在有二十六个厂子；1959年1—8月总产值四十万二千元，比1958年同期增加五倍。人民公社是以按劳分配为原则，实行了粮食供给制。这是最大的社会保险，解决了广大农民的吃饭问题。在今年严重的涝灾情况下，没有人再为吃饭发愁，全社一心搞生产战胜灾害，开展秋菜丰产竞赛运动。
    殷维臣最后说：为了保证农业生产的继续大跃进，全体社员正在鼓足更大的干劲，争取两年内彻底改变生产面貌。我们要向工人老大哥看齐，你们加快社会主义建设，我们保证紧紧赶上来，我代表我们全体社员向大会保证，一定要学习英雄们的干劲和决心，努力搞好农业生产，增加蔬菜、粮食和乳肉，支援国家工业建设。黄土岗人民公社一定要走在前面，夺得红旗，两年全部机械化，五年公社变花园。
