    Heroes from all Roads "Present Treasures" and "Gather Experience" at the Gathering of Heroes, Issuing a Proposal
    Forty Thousand Railway Workers Express Determination at Broadcast Rally
    To Fully Leap Forward and Transport More Materials for the Country
    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 8th, 385 representatives from the railway system and the Railway Corps attending the National Conference of Heroes proposed to railway workers and Railway Corps across the country to complete this year's transportation and capital construction tasks ahead of schedule, and strive to transport more goods and build more passenger and freight cars for the country beyond the original plan. This proposal was put forward at the concluding broadcast meeting of the railway system's advanced experience exchange meeting held on the 6th. The proposal also called for making high slopes bow their heads and wind and snow give way, planting the banner of victory in the most difficult places, striving for a "flying start" in transportation production in the first quarter of next year, changing the phenomenon of being relaxed at the beginning and tight at the end, and creating favorable conditions for continued leap forward in 1960.
    In order to ensure the early completion of the national transportation plan, the representatives, based on the results of the experience exchange in the railway system in the past few days, emphatically proposed in the proposal to carry out a vigorous red flag competition movement of "taking transportation as the key link and making an all-round leap forward" throughout the entire railway, and strive to reduce the turnaround time of freight cars throughout the railway to 2.2 days this winter and spring, increase the static load of freight cars to 42.5 tons, increase the daily output of each locomotive by 10% compared with last winter, resolutely implement the transportation policy of "taking coal as the key link, vigorously supporting agriculture, ensuring key points, and making overall arrangements," vigorously promote internal and external cooperation, and let the experience of organizing "one-dragon" transportation cooperation blossom and bear fruit everywhere; strengthen passenger transportation organization work, provide civilized, polite, orderly, and absolutely safe services to passengers. The proposal also put forward specific requirements for the work of factories, vehicles, and capital construction departments.
    The proposal of advanced producers to strive to complete this year's transportation and capital construction plans ahead of schedule was warmly responded to by 400,000 workers who participated in the broadcast meeting. Many people spoke at the broadcast meeting expressing full confidence in realizing this proposal and put forward guarantee conditions.
    This proposal was put forward by the representatives after extensive and in-depth exchange of experience, and after deliberation and discussion. This railway system experience exchange meeting lasted for five days from November 2nd to 6th. The representatives believed that they learned the advanced ideas of the heroes who were selfless and loyal to the cause of communism at this meeting, and also learned many specific good experiences, so they were full of energy and confidence was greatly increased.
    Among the hundreds of experiences exchanged at this time, the most prominent was the experience of large-scale transportation cooperation that emerged in the mass movement. Sun Chunhe, the representative of Fuxin Station, who first created the experience of road-mine cooperation, introduced the changes in their unit before and after the cooperation. Guo Jichang, the representative of Qinhuangdao Station, introduced the experience of Qinhuangdao Station and the port after cooperation, which increased the transportation capacity by more than 50%. Qiu Shuyong, the representative of Benxi Station, introduced the experience of close cooperation between the station and the factory. Their experiences all proved that forming "one-dragon" transportation cooperation can create new and greater productivity.
    In terms of locomotive work, Cai Lianxing, the driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, detailed their experience of safely traveling more than one million kilometers for thirteen years due to good maintenance and proper operation of the locomotive. Zhang Guoquan, the representative of the Shanghai Locomotive Depot KF-7 charter group, introduced the experience of safely traveling 1.5 million kilometers in ten years of driving. The proposal made by the representatives to railway drivers across the country that all locomotives should achieve high-quality maintenance, high-quality operation and stoking, and high-quality rapid repair of vehicles was based on their experience.
    Representatives from factories, capital construction, vehicle maintenance, and other departments of the railway system also exchanged many effective experiences at the meeting.
    Lu Zhengcao, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, called on the representatives in the summary of the meeting to take advantage of the National Conference of Heroes to promote all advanced experiences without omission, so that pacesetters become rows, red flags become forests, everyone is advanced, the entire railway is advanced, and the entire country is advanced.
    In order to present a gift to the National Conference of Heroes, from October 27th to November 5th, railway workers across the country launched a vigorous high-yield and high-quality transportation campaign. In those ten days, the four main indicators of railway transportation work all created the highest records since this year, with an average of more than 600 more cars loaded per day than in the previous ten days. Good news of creating new records of high output in other aspects also continued to spread from various places to the National Conference of Heroes.

    学先进　比先进　赶先进　帮后进
    各路英雄在群英会上“献宝”“取经”发出倡议
    四十万铁路职工在广播大会上表示决心
    全面跃进为国家运送更多物资
    据新华社8日讯　出席全国群英大会的铁路系统和铁道兵三百八十五名代表，向全国铁路职工和铁道兵倡议提前完成今年的运输和基本建设任务，争取在原定计划之外，再为国家运更多的货物，造更多的客货车。这个倡议是在6日举行的铁路系统先进经验交流会议的总结广播大会上提出的。倡议书中还提出要让高坡低头，风雪让路，把胜利的红旗插到最困难的地方，力争明年第一季度运输生产“开门红”，改变历年前松后紧现象，为1960年继续跃进创造良好条件。
    为了保证提前完成国家运输计划，代表们根据铁路系统几天来交流经验的结果，在倡议书中着重提出要在全路轰轰烈烈地开展“以运输为纲、全面跃进”的红旗竞赛运动，力争在今冬明春将全路货车周转时间压缩到二点二天，货车静载重提高到四十二点五吨，每台机车日产量比去年冬天提高10％，坚决贯彻“以煤为纲，大力支援农业，保证重点，全面安排”的运输方针，大搞路内外协作，让组织“一条龙”运输协作的经验遍地开花结果；加强旅客运输组织工作，有文化、有礼貌、有秩序、绝对安全地为旅客服务。倡议书上，还提出了对工厂、车辆、基本建设各个部门工作的具体要求。
    先进生产者们争取提前完成今年运输和基本建设计划的倡议，获得了参加广播大会的四十万职工的热烈响应。许多人在广播大会上发言表示有充分信心实现这一倡议，并提出了保证条件。
    这个倡议是代表们经过广泛深入交流经验，酝酿讨论之后提出的，这次铁路系统经验交流会议从11月2日到6日，一共开了五天。会议按专业分成运输、基本建设、工厂、电务、机务等九个分组交流经验。代表们认为，在这次会上学习了英雄们奋不顾身、忠于共产主义事业的先进思想，也学得了许多具体的好经验，因此他们干劲冲天，信心倍增。
    这次交流的几百条经验中，最突出的是群众运动中出现的运输大协作的经验。最先创造路矿协作经验的阜新车站代表孙春和，介绍了他们单位在协作前后的变化。秦皇岛车站代表郭继昌，介绍了秦皇岛车站和港口协作后，运输能力提高50％以上的经验。本溪车站代表丘树庸，介绍了车站和工厂密切协作的经验。他们的经验都证明组成“一条龙”的运输协作，就能创造出新的更大的生产力。
    在机务工作方面，“毛泽东号”机车司机长蔡连兴详细介绍了他们十三年来由于机车保养得好，操纵得法，安全走行一百多万公里的经验。上海机务段KF——七号包车组代表张国铨介绍了行车十年，安全走行一百五十万公里的经验。代表们在倡议中向全国铁路司机们提出的所有机车都要作到高质量保养，高质量操纵、焚火，高质量快速修车的倡议，就是根据他们的经验提出的。
    来自铁路系统的工厂、基本建设、车辆检修等方面的代表，也在会上交流了很多行之有效的好经验。
    铁道部副部长吕正操在大会总结中号召代表们要乘全国群英大会之势，把所有先进经验一个不漏地推广起来，做到标兵成行，红旗成林，人人先进，全路先进，全国先进。
    为了向全国群英会献礼，从10月27日到11月5日的十天中，全国铁路职工轰轰烈烈地展开了运输高产优质运动。十天中，铁路运输工作的四项主要指标都创造了今年以来的最高纪录，每天平均比前十天多装六百多车。其他各方面创造高产新纪录的捷报，也不断地从各地传到全国群英会。
