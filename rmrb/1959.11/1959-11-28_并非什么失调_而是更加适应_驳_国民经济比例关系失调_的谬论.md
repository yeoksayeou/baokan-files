Not Imbalance But Greater Adaptation
    -- Refuting the Fallacy of "Imbalance in National Economic Proportions"
    Yang Bo
    In 1958, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and inspired by the general line of socialist construction, the Chinese people unleashed their revolutionary drive and pioneering spirit, resulting in an unprecedented all-round great leap forward in all sectors of the national economy. However, a handful of right-leaning opportunists, standing on the side of capitalism, launched a disgraceful attack on the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. One of their main "arguments" was that the Great Leap Forward had caused an imbalance in the proportions of the national economy. Of course, the actual situation is completely contrary to the fallacies of the right-leaning opportunists.
    In the process of social reproduction, the proportional relationships in the various aspects of the national economy are diverse, with some being major and others minor; some affecting the overall situation and others only playing a role within individual departments. To observe whether the proportional relationships in the national economy are adapted or imbalanced, one should look at the major proportional relationships. This is common sense in Marxist economics. What are the major proportional relationships in the development of the national economy? According to the Marxist theory of reproduction, the most important proportional relationship in the national economy is the proportional relationship between the production of means of production and the production of means of consumption, and under the conditions of expanded reproduction with technological progress, the production of means of production occupies a position of priority growth. This basic principle of Marx's theory of reproduction was formulated on the basis of a thorough study of the capitalist production process; but it is not only applicable to capitalism. Lenin pointed out that Marx's formula regarding the contrasting relationship between the first and second categories is effective for both socialism and communism. The Party's general line for socialist construction, which proposes a whole set of "walking on two legs" policies for developing the national economy, such as simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and simultaneously developing heavy and light industry, under the premise of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, is a creative application of the Marxist theory of reproduction based on the practice of socialist construction in our country. Because heavy industrial products are the main part of the means of production, and agricultural and light industrial products are the main part of the means of consumption, simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and simultaneously developing heavy and light industry under the premise of prioritizing the development of heavy industry comprehensively and profoundly reflects the objective requirements of the proportional relationship between the production of means of production and the production of means of consumption, and embodies the objective law of planned and proportionate development of the socialist economy.
    Below, we will analyze the development of the major sectors of China's national economy in 1958 based on the above-mentioned Marxist principles regarding the major proportional relationships in the national economy, combined with China's historical situation. From this, it can be seen that in 1958, due to the all-round great leap forward in the national economy, the major proportional relationships in the various sectors of the national economy were not imbalanced, but became more coordinated and more adapted. It has laid a good foundation for China to further move towards industrialization and the continued high-speed leap forward of the national economy.
        The Relationship between Industry and Agriculture
    First, look at the relationship between industry and agriculture. Industry and agriculture are the two most basic material production sectors in the national economy, and their development and changes largely determine the development and changes in the various processes of expanded reproduction in the entire national economy—production, distribution, circulation, and consumption.
    Old China, due to the long-term reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the national economy was very backward. Not only was industry extremely underdeveloped, but agricultural production was also in a backward state for a long time. By 1949, industry accounted for 30.1% of the total value of industrial and agricultural output, and agriculture accounted for 69.9%. This proportional relationship could not adapt to the requirements of socialist industrialization at all, let alone the requirements of high-speed development of the national economy. After the nationwide liberation, in order to gradually and thoroughly change this backward situation and establish a new relationship between industry and agriculture, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, after the restoration of the national economy and the completion of the land reform, timely put forward the Party's general line during the transition period, requiring the gradual realization of national socialist industrialization and the gradual completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture, so that the scattered individual small-scale peasant economy could be quickly transferred to the track of the socialist collective large-scale agricultural economy, making the development of agriculture adapt to the requirements of national industrialization. Under the guidance of this general line, during the First Five-Year Plan period, China's industrial production achieved significant development, with the total value of industrial output increasing by 128.4%; establishing a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization. In terms of agriculture, with the victorious completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture, production also increased rapidly. Compared with 1952, the total value of agricultural output increased by 24.7% in 1957. Because the growth of industrial production was faster than the growth of agricultural production, the old proportional relationship between industry and agriculture also changed. The specific situation is as follows: (%)
                 1949    1952    1957
　Total value of industrial and agricultural output    100.0     100.0     100.0
  Industry　　　　　30.1　　41.5　　56.5
  Agriculture　　　　　69.9　　58.5　　43.5
    In 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, China's industrial and agricultural production both experienced an unprecedented great leap forward, and the proportional relationship between industry and agriculture also underwent new changes: the proportion of industry in the total value of industrial and agricultural output further increased to 63.6%, and agriculture decreased to 36.4%.
    From the above brief account, it can be seen that the relationship between industry and agriculture in China has been constantly changing over the past ten years. This change is caused by the common development of industrial and agricultural production. This change is not only beneficial to China's development towards socialist industrialization, but also beneficial to the continuous consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance and the comprehensive and high-speed development of the entire national economy.
    In 1958, under the guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction and the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, China's industrial and agricultural production both experienced an unprecedented great leap forward. In that year, industrial production increased by 66%, equivalent to 3.7 times the average annual growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan period; agricultural production increased by 25%, equivalent to 5.6 times the average annual growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan period. Such a high rate of development in agricultural production, as Premier Zhou pointed out, is a particularly great leap forward. The relationship between industry and agriculture is more adapted than in the past. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the relationship between the growth rate of industry and the growth rate of agriculture was roughly four to one, that is, calculated based on the average annual growth rate, for every 4% increase in industry, agriculture increased by 1%. The situation in 1958 underwent great changes, with the relationship between the growth rate of industry and the growth rate of agriculture changing to 2.6 to 1, that is, for every 2.6% increase in industry, agriculture increased by 1%; the distance between the two was significantly narrowed compared to the past. This means that, relatively speaking, the growth rate of agriculture in 1958 was faster compared to the growth rate of industry than in the past. Precisely because of this, the amount of grain and raw materials provided by agriculture to industry in 1958 also increased compared to the past. In that year, the raw materials provided by agriculture to industry reached 14 billion yuan, more than in any previous year; at the same time, the means of production provided by industry to agriculture were also much greater than in previous years. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the average annual value of the main means of production provided by industry to agriculture was 1.04 billion yuan, while in 1958 it reached 3.15 billion yuan, an increase of two times. This very well illustrates that the relationship between industry and agriculture in 1958 was more adapted and more coordinated than in the past.
      The Relationship between Heavy Industry and Light Industry
    Secondly, let's look at the relationship between heavy industry and light industry. In order to explain this issue, it is also necessary to briefly discuss the relationship between heavy and light industry in the era of Old China. As everyone knows, industry in Old China was very backward, especially lacking a heavy industrial base. In 1949, when the country was liberated, light industry accounted for nearly three-quarters of the total value of industrial output, while heavy industry only accounted for a little more than one-quarter. Not only that, but the existing little heavy industry was also disjointed, incomplete, and fundamentally not a complete set. This is one of the main reasons why China was subjected to imperialist aggression and oppression for a long time. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, in order to completely change this situation, the Party put forward the great task of gradually realizing socialist industrialization and determined the correct policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. Under the guidance of this correct policy, China's heavy industry has made rapid progress over the past ten years. Compared with 1949, heavy industrial production increased by nearly twenty times in 1958; among them, the iron and steel industry increased by fifty-one times, and the machine manufacturing industry increased by sixty-four times. Due to the rapid growth of heavy industry, the composition within industry has undergone major changes. The proportion of heavy industrial output value in the total industrial output value was 26.6% in 1949, increased to 35.6% in 1952, increased to 48.4% in 1957, and further increased to 57.3% in 1958, exceeding more than half of the total industrial output value. This change marks that the foundation of China's socialist industrialization has been firmly established.
    Prioritizing the development of heavy industry is the fundamental policy of the Party's socialist industrialization. However, we have never neglected to actively develop light industry because of this. Compared with 1949, light industrial production increased by 4.3 times in 1958, with an average annual increase of 20.2%. Such a growth rate of light industrial production has never existed in Old China, nor can it be found in capitalist countries. That is to say, the change in the proportional relationship between heavy and light industry in China is caused by the priority growth of heavy industry and the continuous development of light industry, and is completely reasonable.
    In 1958, under the guidance of the policy of simultaneously developing heavy and light industry proposed by the Party, both heavy and light industry experienced unprecedented great leaps forward. In that year, heavy industry increased by 103%, equivalent to four times the average annual increase of 25.4% during the First Five-Year Plan period; light industry increased by 34%, equivalent to 2.7 times the average annual increase of 12.8% during the First Five-Year Plan period. The growth of both light and heavy industry exceeded the growth rate of any previous year. Can such a high development speed of light industrial production be said to be heavy industry squeezing light industry?! As for the change in the proportional relationship between heavy and light industry caused by the faster development of heavy industry than light industry, it is completely reasonable. This is precisely the specific embodiment of correctly implementing the Party's policy of simultaneously developing heavy and light industry under the premise of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. It also conforms to the theoretical principle of Marxism to prioritize the production of means of production.
        The Relationship within Heavy Industry
    What about the relationship within heavy industry? In 1958, in addition to steel and pig iron, the output of coal, power generation equipment, power machinery, automobiles, and other heavy industrial products increased by more than doubled. The absolute increase in other products such as metal cutting machine tools, electricity, crude oil, soda ash, caustic soda, cement, and wood also exceeded that of any previous year. Electricity was originally a relatively weak link in heavy industry, but in that year it also increased by 42.4%, creating a growth rate that had never been seen before. During the First Five-Year Plan period, electricity increased by a total of 12.1 billion kilowatt-hours, while in 1958 alone, it increased by nearly 8.2 billion kilowatt-hours, equivalent to more than two-thirds of the total increase in the past five years; in that year, the output of power generation equipment was equivalent to four times that of the previous year. This shows that the power industry is striving to catch up under the leadership of "taking steel as the key link." All this shows that the relationship within industry in 1958 was basically adapted and reasonable. It shows that "taking steel as the key link" led to the common leap forward of other departments, rather than squeezing out other departments.
        The Relationship between Production and Construction
    Again, look at the relationship between production and construction. In 1958, heavy industrial production increased by 103%, and national capital construction investment increased by 93%. Production basically guaranteed the needs of construction, and the relationship between production and construction was basically adapted and reasonable. Similarly, precisely because the scale of capital construction expanded, it also powerfully guaranteed the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. In 1958, the number of industrial and mining construction units under construction nationwide reached more than 50,000, of which more than 41,000 had been completed and put into production, an increase of four times and three times respectively compared with the First Five-Year Plan period. In that year, the newly added production capacity of major industrial products, compared with the average annual new capacity during the First Five-Year Plan period, electricity was 2.6 times more, coal was 1.5 times more, natural petroleum was 4 times more, synthetic ammonia was 3 times more, sulfuric acid was 5 times more, soda ash was 3.3 times more, caustic soda was 2.8 times more, cement was 2.8 times more, machine-made paper was 6.9 times more, and spindles were 1.2 times more; as for steel production capacity, it greatly exceeded the sum of the newly added capacity during the First Five-Year Plan period. The great leap forward in production guaranteed the high-speed growth of capital construction; the unprecedented expansion of the construction scale, in turn, promoted the great leap forward in production. This is a powerful proof that the relationship between production and construction is adapted and reasonable.
        The Relationship between Accumulation and Consumption
    Finally, let's talk about the relationship between accumulation and consumption. In socialist countries, the distribution of national income between accumulation and consumption centrally reflects the mutual relationship between national construction and the people's lives. The accumulation in 1958 increased very quickly, and there were new changes in the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption, but under what conditions was this achieved? It was achieved on the basis of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the high-speed growth of national income, and the significant improvement of the people's lives. In 1958, the national consumption fund increased by more than 11%, and the average consumption level per person increased by about 8% (of which the consumption level of farmers increased by about 10%), exceeding the rate of increase in any previous year. Under the condition of ensuring the gradual improvement of the people's living standards, increasing some accumulation is completely beneficial to the high-speed development of China's socialist construction.
    In summary, it can be clearly seen that the main proportional relationships in China's national economy in 1958 were reasonable, normal, and in line with the objective economic laws of the planned and proportionate development of the national economy. Economic laws do not change according to people's will. If it is said that the proportional relationships in China's national economy were imbalanced and the development of the national economy violated this objective economic law, then how could there have been an all-round great leap forward in the national economy in 1958? And how could there have been a continued leap forward in 1959? Isn't this a very obvious truth?
    Of course, when we say that the main proportional relationships in the national economy in 1958 were coordinated and normal, we do not mean that there were no problems or uncoordinated phenomena in certain links within various economic sectors or in the production of certain products. There were problems, and uncoordinated phenomena also existed, but these were individual, local, and temporary problems; therefore, they were also easy to overcome. In fact, after the adjustment in the first half of this year, the individual, local, and temporary uncoordinated phenomena that once appeared in certain links have been gradually overcome in the development of production. The right-leaning opportunists, seeing only the trees and not the forest, attacking one point and ignoring the rest, shouting about the imbalance in the proportions of the national economy, only proves that this is a smokescreen they released in order to oppose the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes.
    When the right-leaning opportunists attacked the Party, some of our comrades were once confused by them and did not see their true colors clearly; they once made one-sided and wrong understandings of certain phenomena existing in economic life, that is, they did not distinguish the relationship between the nine fingers and one finger. This is a very profound lesson that is worth earnestly drawing.

    并非什么失调　而是更加适应
    ——驳“国民经济比例关系失调”的谬论
    杨波
    1958年，我国人民在党中央和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，发挥了充天地革命干劲和首创精神，国民经济各部门都得到了史无前例的全面大跃进。可是，一小撮右倾机会主义分子，却站在资本主义方面，向党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社展开了可耻的进攻。他们的主要“论据”之一，是说大跃进使得国民经济比例关系失调了。当然，实际情况和右倾机会主义分子的谬论是完全相反的。
    在社会再生产过程中，国民经济各方面的比例关系是多种多样的，有主要的，有次要的；有影响全局的，有只在个别部门内部发生作用的。观察国民经济中的比例关系是适应还是失调，应该从主要的比例关系来看，这是马克思主义经济学的常识。什么是国民经济发展中的主要比例关系呢？按照马克思主义的再生产原理，国民经济中最主要的比例关系，是生产资料生产和消费资料生产两大部类的比例关系，而在技术进步的扩大再生产条件下，生产资料生产居于优先增长的地位。马克思的这一再生产理论的基本原理，是在透彻地研究了资本主义生产过程的基础上制定的；但它不仅适用于资本主义。列宁指出，马克思关于第一部类和第二部类对比关系的公式，对于社会主义和对于共产主义都是有效的。我们党的社会主义建设总路线所提出的在优先发展重工业的条件下，实行工业和农业同时并举、重工业和轻工业同时并举等一整套的“两条腿走路”的发展国民经济的方针，就是根据我国社会主义建设的实践，创造性地运用马克思主义再生产原理而制定的。由于重工业产品是生产资料的主要部分，农产品和轻工业产品是消费资料的主要部分，所以在优先发展重工业的条件下，工业和农业并举，重工业和轻工业并举，就是全面地、深刻地反映了生产资料生产和消费资料生产比例关系的客观要求，体现了社会主义经济有计划按比例发展的客观规律。
    下面，我们根据上述马克思主义关于国民经济主要比例关系的原理，结合我国历史情况，分析一下我国1958年国民经济各主要部门的发展情况，就可以看出，在1958年，由于国民经济的全面大跃进，国民经济各部门的主要比例关系不是失调了，而是更加协调、更加适应了。它已给我国进一步走向工业化和国民经济高速度地继续跃进，奠定了良好的基础。
        工业和农业的关系
    首先看工业和农业的关系。工业和农业是国民经济中两个最基本的物质生产部门，它们的发展变化，在很大程度上决定了整个国民经济扩大再生产的各个过程——生产、分配、流通、消费、积累之间的发展变化。
    旧中国，由于长期受着帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，国民经济是十分落后的，不但工业极不发达，农业生产也长期处于中世纪的落后状态。到1949年，在工农业总产值中，工业占30.1％，农业占69.9％。这种比例关系根本不能适应社会主义工业化的要求，更谈不到适应国民经济高速度发展的要求。全国解放以后，为了逐步、彻底改变这种落后状况，建立新的工农业之间的关系，党中央和毛泽东同志在国民经济恢复工作和土地改革完成以后，及时地提出了党在过渡时期的总路线，要求逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业的社会主义改造，使分散的个体小农经济迅速转移到社会主义的集体大农业经济轨道上来，使农业的发展适应国家工业化的要求。在这一总路线的指导下，第一个五年计划期间，我国的工业生产有了显著发展，工业总产值增长了128.4％；建立起了社会主义工业化的初步基础。农业方面，随着农业社会主义改造的胜利完成，生产的增长也是很快的，1957年同1952年比较，农业总产值增长了24.7％。由于工业生产的增长快于农业生产的增长，从而也就改变了旧的工农业之间的比例关系。具体情况如下：（％）
                1949年　1952年　1957年
　工农业总产值　100.0 　100.0 　100.0
  工业　　　　　30.1　　41.5　　56.5
  农业　　　　　69.9　　58.5　　43.51958年，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，我国工业生产和农业生产都出现了史无前例的大跃进，工农业之间的比例关系也发生了新的变化：在工农业总产值中，工业所占比重进一步提高到63.6％，农业下降到36.4％。
    从以上的简要叙述中，可以看出，十年来我国工农业之间的关系不断地在变化着。这种变化，是在工农业生产共同发展的基础上引起的，这种变化不仅有利于我国向社会主义工业化发展，而且有利于工农联盟的不断巩固，有利于整个国民经济的全面高速地发展。
    1958年，在党的社会主义建设总路线和工、农业同时并举方针的指导下，我国的工业生产和农业生产都出现了前所未有的大跃进。这一年，工业生产增长了66％，相当于第一个五年计划期间平均每年增长速度的三点七倍；农业生产增长了25％，相当于第一个五年计划期间平均每年增长速度的五点六倍。农业生产发展的这样高的速度，正如周总理所指出的，这是一个特大的跃进。工农业之间的关系比过去更加适应了。第一个五年计划期间，工业增长速度与农业增长速度的关系，大体上是四与一之比，即按平均每年增长速度计算，工业每增长4％，农业增长1％。1958年的情况有了很大变化，工业增长速度与农业增长速度的关系，改变为二点六与一之比，即工业每增长2.6％，农业即增长1％；两者的距离比过去显著地缩小了。这也就是说，1958年农业的增长速度同工业增长速度比较，相对说来，比过去更加加快了。正因为如此，所以1958年农业提供给工业的粮食和原料也比过去增多了。这一年，农业提供给工业的原料达到一百四十亿元，比过去任何一年都多；同时，工业提供给农业的生产资料也大大多于以往各年，第一个五年计划期间工业提供给农业的主要生产资料平均每年为十亿零四千万元，1958年则达到三十一亿五千万元，增长了两倍。这就很好的说明了1958年工农业之间的关系，比过去是更加适应了，更加协调了呢。
      重工业和轻工业的关系
    其次，看看重工业和轻工业的关系。为了说明这个问题，也有必要先简单说说旧中国时代的重轻工业之间的关系。大家知道，旧中国的工业是十分落后的，特别是缺乏重工业的基础，全国解放时的1949年，工业总产值中轻工业占将近四分之三，重工业仅占四分之一多一点。不仅如此，已有的一点点重工业，也是相互脱节，残缺不全，根本不成套。这是我国长期受帝国主义侵略、压迫的主要原因之一。中华人民共和国成立后，为了彻底改变这种状况，党提出了逐步实现社会主义工业化的伟大任务，确定了优先发展重工业的正确方针。在这一正确方针指导下，十年来我国的重工业有了突飞猛进的发展，1958年同1949年比较，重工业生产增长了将近二十倍；其中钢铁工业增长了五十一倍，机器制造工业增长了六十四倍。由于重工业迅速增长，就使工业内部的构成发生了重大变化，重工业产值在工业总产值中所占比重，1949年是26.6％，1952年提高到35.6％，1957年提高到48.4％，1958年再提高到57.3％，超过工业总产值的一半以上。这一变化，标志着我国社会主义工业化的基础已经巩固地建立起来了。
    优先发展重工业，是党的社会主义工业化的根本方针。但是，我们绝没有因此而忽视积极发展轻工业。1958年同1949年比较，轻工业生产增长四点三倍，平均每年增长20.2％。轻工业生产的这种增长速度，不但旧中国从来没有过，资本主义国家也是找不到的。这就是说，我国重工业和轻工业之间的比例关系的变化，是在重工业优先增长和轻工业不断发展的基础上引起的，是完全合理的。
    1958年在党所提出的重工业和轻工业同时并举方针指导下，重工业和轻工业都出现了前所未有的大跃进。这一年，重工业增长103％，相当于第一个五年计划期间平均每年增长25.4％的四倍；轻工业增长34％，相当于第一个五年计划期间平均每年增长12.8％的二点七倍，轻重工业的增长都超过了以往任何一年的增长速度。轻工业生产这样高的发展速度，难道能够说是重工业挤了轻工业吗？！至于说到由于重工业发展快于轻工业而引起的重轻工业之间比例关系的变化，那是完全合理的，这正是正确执行党的在优先发展重工业的条件下重工业和轻工业同时并举方针的具体体现。它也符合于马克思主义优先发展生产资料生产的理论原理。
        重工业内部的关系
    重工业内部的关系怎样？1958年重工业产品产量增长一倍以上的，除了钢和生铁以外，还有煤炭、发电设备、动力机械、汽车等。其他如金属切削机床、电力、原油、纯碱、烧碱、水泥、木材等产品增长的绝对量，也都超过了以往任何一年。电力原来是重工业中比较薄弱的环节，这一年也增长了42.4％，创造了过去从来没有过的增长速度。第一个五年计划期间，电力总共增长了一百二十一亿度，而1958年一年就增长了将近八十二亿度，相当于过去五年总增产量的三分之二以上；这一年发电设备的产量相当于上一年的四倍。这说明电力工业在“以钢为纲”的带动下正在努力向前追赶。这一切，说明1958年工业内部的关系，基本上是相适应的，是合理的。说明“以钢为纲”带动了其他部门的共同跃进，而不是挤掉了其他部门。
        生产和建设的关系
    再次，看生产和建设的关系。1958年重工业生产增长103％，国家基本建设投资增长93％，生产基本上保证了建设的需要，生产和建设的关系基本上是适应的、合理的。同样，正由于基本建设规模扩大，也就有力地保证了工农业生产的大跃进。1958年全国施工的工矿建设单位数达五万多个，其中已经建成投入生产的有四万一千多个，分别比第一个五年计划期间增长了四倍和三倍。这一年新增加的主要工业产品生产能力，同第一个五年计划期间平均每年新增能力比较，电力多二点六倍，煤炭多一点五倍，天然石油多四倍，合成氨多三倍，硫酸多五倍，纯碱多三点三倍，烧碱多二点八倍，水泥多二点八倍，机制纸多六点九倍，纱锭多一点二倍；至于钢铁生产能力，则更是大大超过了第一个五年计划期间新增能力的总和。生产大跃进，保证了基本建设的高速度增长；建设规模空前扩大，又促进了生产大跃进，这就是生产和建设的关系是适应的、合理的有力证明。
        积累和消费的关系
    最后，谈谈积累和消费的关系。社会主义国家里，国民收入在积累和消费之间的分配，集中地反映了国家建设和人民生活之间的相互关系。1958年的积累增加很快，积累和消费的比例关系有了新的变化，但这是在什么样的条件下实现的呢？是在工农业生产大跃进，国民收入高速度增长，人民生活显著提高的基础上实现的。1958年全国消费基金增长了11％以上，每人平均的消费水平提高了8％左右（其中农民的消费水平提高了10％左右），超过了以往任何一年的提高速度。在保证人民生活水平逐步提高的条件下，多增加一些积累，这是完全有利于我国社会主义建设的高速度发展的。
    综上所述，可以很清楚地看到，1958年我国国民经济中的主要比例关系，是合理的、正常的，是符合于国民经济有计划按比例地发展的客观经济规律的。经济规律，是不以人们的意志为转移的。如果说我国国民经济的比例关系失调了，国民经济的发展违反了这一客观经济规律，那么又怎样会出现1958年的国民经济全面大跃进呢？又怎样会出现1959年的继续跃进呢？这不是很显明的道理吗？
    当然，我们说1958年国民经济中主要比例关系是协调的、正常的，并不是说在各经济部门内部的某些环节上，某些产品的生产上，没有任何问题，没有一点不协调的现象。问题是有的，不协调的现象也是存在的，但这是个别的、局部的、暂时性的问题；因之也是容易克服的。事实上，经过今年上半年的调整，某些环节上曾经出现的个别的、局部的、暂时性的不协调现象，已经在生产的发展中，逐步得到克服。右倾机会主义分子，只见树木，不见森林，攻其一点，不及其余，大叫什么国民经济比例关系失调了，只不过证明这是他们为了反对总路线、大跃进和人民公社而放的一股烟幕而已。
    在右倾机会主义分子向党进攻的时候，我们一部分同志曾经一度受过他们的迷惑，没有看清楚他们的真面目；对经济生活中存在的某些现象曾经作过片面的、错误的理解，即没有分清楚九个指头和一个指头的关系。这是值得认真吸取的一个极深刻的教训。
