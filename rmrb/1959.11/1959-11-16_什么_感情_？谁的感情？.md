What "Feelings"? Whose Feelings?
    Li Guangwen

    When right-leaning opportunists pushed their erroneous ideas like "contracting work to households" and "dividing livestock among households for feeding," they shouted that this was to create "feelings" between people and the land, and livestock. After hearing this, people can't help but ask: What kind of "feelings" do you want to create between people and the land, and livestock?

    In a class society, everyone's feelings are invariably stamped with the brand of class; different classes have different feelings. The "contracting work to households" and "dividing livestock among households for feeding" promoted by right-leaning opportunists, which resulted in "poor peasants crying and well-off middle peasants laughing" in some areas, is the same example.

    Our cause is a collective cause, and the ultimate goal of the proletarian revolution is to liberate all of mankind. In this great struggle, peasants are always the most reliable allies of the proletariat. Although they have a spontaneous tendency to take the path of individualism and going it alone, they have concluded from thousands of years of historical practice and countless bloody lessons that this path is a dead end! If peasants want to achieve their own complete liberation, there is only one path, and that is to follow the socialist path and the path of common advancement, the path of collectivization, under the leadership of the working class's vanguard—the Communist Party. The Chinese peasants of the past ten years since the founding of the country are no longer the peasants of before liberation and the early days after liberation. This is not only reflected in the fundamental changes in ownership, but also in the great differences in their thoughts and feelings. The vast majority of them are now concerned with the collective rather than the individual. They have more noble feelings for the land and livestock, feelings that are not manifested in their own piece of land or head of livestock, but in the entire collective's land and livestock. There are many examples of this. When I was sent down to be a commune member this May, I saw such a thing again: In the collective breeding room, a cow gave birth to a calf that was born prematurely. The breeder and his wife were as happy as if they had a grandson, while several well-off middle peasants said in unison: "The calf is premature and won't live until tomorrow morning." Deep in the night, when it was quiet, only the breeder and his wife couldn't sleep. They lit a fire to warm the calf for a while, then fed the calf hot rice soup, and then helped the calf to get up and learn to walk. When dawn broke and the sun came out, the calf lived.

    What we praise is this proletarian feeling that cares for the collective more than oneself, this collectivist feeling; what we despise is that kind of profit-seeking, bourgeois individualistic "feeling." The right-leaning opportunists want people to have "feelings" for a small piece of land and a portion of livestock, with the aim of undermining socialism and retreating to capitalism. They have no feelings for socialism. They do not share the same heart or walk the same path as our broad masses of working people. But socialism has taken root in the hearts of the people, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have developed deep feelings for the people's communes. They are determined to take the path of collective economy. The obstruction of the right-leaning opportunists is simply an ant trying to shake a tree, ridiculous and overestimating their capabilities.

    什么“感情”？谁的感情？
    李光温
    右倾机会主义分子在推行自己的“包工包产到户”、“牲畜分犋喂养”等错误主张的时候，大喊这是叫人和土地、牲畜发生“感情”。听了以后，人们不禁发问：你们到底要使人和土地、牲畜发生什么样的“感情”呢？
    在阶级社会里，每一个人的感情无不打上阶级的烙印；不同的阶级有不同的感情。右倾机会主义分子的“包工包产到户”、“牲畜分犋喂养”在个别地区推行后，“贫农哭了，富裕中农笑了”，也是同样的例子。
    我们的事业是集体的事业，无产阶级革命的最终目的是解放全人类。在这一伟大斗争中，农民始终是无产阶级最可靠的同盟军，他们虽然有自发走个体和单干道路的倾向，但在数千年的历史实践和无数血的教训中得出了结论——此路不通！农民要获得自身的彻底解放，道路只有一条，那就是在工人阶级的先锋队——共产党的领导下，走社会主义和共同上升的道路，走集体化的道路。建国十年来的我国农民，已经不是解放前和解放初期的农民了，这不仅表现在所有制上起了根本的变化，而且在思想上、感情上也大大不同了。他们中间的绝大多数现在关心的已经不是个人而是集体。他们和土地、牲畜有着更加高尚的感情，这种感情不是表现在自己的一块土地、一头牲畜上，而是在整个集体的土地和牲畜上。这方面的例子多得很。今年5月我下放当社员的时候，就又看到了这样的事情：集体饲养室里，母牛生下了一头不够月的小牛犊，饲养员和他的老伴像有了小孙子似的高兴，而几个富裕中农呢，却异口同声地说：“牛犊不够月活不到明早起。”夜深了，人静了，惟独饲养员和他的老伴睡不着，一会儿给牛犊点火取暖，一会儿给牛犊灌热米汤，一会儿又扶小牛起来学走路，天亮了，太阳出来了，小牛犊活了。
    我们赞扬的就是这种关心集体胜过关心自己的无产阶级的感情，集体主义的感情；我们唾弃那种唯利是图的资产阶级个人主义的“感情”。右倾机会主义分子想使人和一小块土地、一部分牲畜发生“感情”，目的正在搞垮社会主义，退到资本主义去。他们同社会主义是没有感情的。他们同我们广大劳动人民，怀的不是一条心，走的不是一条路。可是社会主义已经深入人心，广大贫农和下中农已对人民公社发生了深厚的感情，他们坚决走集体经济的道路，右倾机会主义分子的阻挠，简直是蚍蜉撼大树，太可笑不自量了。
