According to a report from the New Hunan Daily, in the mass movement for water conservancy construction this year, Wudong Commune in Wugang County, Hunan Province, vigorously reformed tools, gradually realizing mechanized earthwork construction, and achieving high efficiency, good quality, and fast progress. The entire commune has newly built 55 small reservoirs, renovated and expanded 22 small reservoirs, and newly built 22 mountain ponds, along with 323 other projects. 83% of the total earth and stone work has been completed, with an average daily efficiency of nearly 13 cubic meters per person. The original plan required 690,000 labor days, but now it can be reduced by about two-thirds, and the completion time can be shortened from the original plan of 70 days to 40 days. Shaoyang Prefecture has planted the high-efficiency water conservancy red flag in this commune. A competition upsurge of "learning from Wudong, catching up with Wudong, and surpassing Wudong" is being launched throughout the region.

Wudong Commune overcame a major drought that lasted more than 120 days this year and achieved a bumper harvest. However, to ensure the continued leap forward in agricultural production, water conservancy conditions must be greatly improved. Therefore, according to the demands of the masses, the commune party committee expanded the winter water conservancy construction plan. The earth and stone work for the commune's water conservancy projects was increased from the original plan of 690,000 cubic meters to 1,080,000 cubic meters. The number of newly built and expanded small reservoirs was increased from the original 29 to 107, and the number of small water conservancy projects such as ponds and dams was increased to more than 1,000.

In order to overcome the difficulties of heavy winter construction tasks and insufficient labor, the commune party committee led the commune members to launch a mass tool reform movement. On the one hand, they renovated and improved some tools that had already been promoted and used last year. On the other hand, based on the principle of using local materials and making use of simple means, they comprehensively grasped the tool reform of each work process. The entire commune organized 320 carpenters, blacksmiths, and bamboo craftsmen to set up factories at the reservoir construction sites. Mishan Brigade took the lead and established a water conservancy tool factory and repair station at the Dengnichong Reservoir construction site, rushing to manufacture and renovate 56 ox-drawn carts, 2 large soil compaction rollers, and 14 sets of slides. At the same time, 34 blasters were trained. When the reservoir started construction, the brigade mobilized 130 strong laborers, using new tools and new technologies for construction. They moved 1,599 cubic meters of earth in one day, with an average efficiency of 12.3 cubic meters per person.

Taking Mishan Brigade as an example, all brigades in the commune widely launched a high-efficiency movement centered on tool reform and technological innovation. The factories at various construction sites adopted the method of "renovating, manufacturing, improving, and using simultaneously," and manufactured and improved a total of more than 2,170 pieces of tools such as ox-drawn automatic unloading carts, animal-powered soil compaction rollers, earth trains, slides, and chutes. The commune ran training classes, training 120 operators of various new tools and technologies. At the same time, it organized five on-site meetings to promote and exchange advanced construction experience. On November 19, the 4,716-member water conservancy army on various construction sites in the commune completed 61,308 cubic meters of earthwork, with an average efficiency of nearly 13 cubic meters, an increase of five to six times compared to the average efficiency before the large-scale tool reform.

In the high-efficiency competition, the brigades helped each other and improved together. When the average daily efficiency per person in Mishan Brigade had reached 5 cubic meters, Datang Brigade had only reached 4 cubic meters. Mishan Brigade immediately sent carpenters to help them improve more than 30 ox-drawn carts, increasing the average efficiency of Datang Brigade to 8.4 cubic meters. Datang Brigade also sent technicians to the Mishan Reservoir construction site to teach the experience of blasting for earth, enabling the average efficiency of Mishan Brigade to jump from 7 cubic meters to 12.4 cubic meters.

The projects completed by this commune have been inspected and evaluated by the County Water Conservancy Bureau and the Commune Party Committee, and the quality fully meets the standards.

    加快小型水利工程建设  武东公社环环改革工具
    工效高　质量好　进度快
    工期可缩短近一半　劳动日可减少三分之二
    据新湖南报消息　湖南省武冈县武东公社在今年水利建设的群众运动中，大闹工具改革，逐步实现施工土机械化，出现了工效高、质量好、进度快的局面。全公社已新建成小水库五十五座，整修和扩建了小水库二十二处，新建成山塘二十二口，其它工程三百二十三处。全部土石方任务已完成83％，每人每天平均工效近十三方，原计划要用六十九万个劳动日，现在约可减少三分之二，竣工时间约可由原计划的七十天缩短到四十天。邵阳专区把水利高工效红旗插在这个公社。全区各地正在掀起“学武东、赶武东、赛武东”的竞赛高潮。
    武东公社今年战胜了持续一百二十多天的大旱，夺得了丰收，但是要保证农业生产继续跃进，水利条件还必须大力改善。因此，公社党委根据群众要求，扩大了冬修水利规划，全公社水利工程的土石方由原计划的六十九万方增加到一百零八万方，新建、扩建的小型水库由原来的二十九座增加到一百零七座，塘坝等小型水利工程增加到一千多处。
    为了克服冬修任务大、劳动力不足的困难，公社党委领导社员掀起了群众性的工具改革运动，一面整修和改进去年已经推广使用的一些工具，一面根据就地取材、因陋就简的原则，把各个工序的工具改革全面抓起来。全公社组织了三百二十个木工、铁工、篾工在水库工地办工厂。米山大队一马当先，在邓泥冲水库工地建立起水利工具厂和修配站，赶制和整修了牛拉车五十六部、压土大滚筒二个、装滑道十四条，同时训练了爆破手三十四人。水库开工时，大队调集了一百三十个健壮劳动力，运用新工具、新技术施工，一天进土一千五百九十九方，每人平均工效达到十二点三方。
    全公社各大队以米山大队为榜样，都以工具改革、技术革新为中心，广泛地开展了高工效运动。各工地工厂采取“边整修，边制造，边改进，边使用”的办法，共制造和改进了牛拉自动卸土车、畜力夯土滚筒、土火车、滑道、滑槽等工具共二千一百七十多件。公社开办了训练班，训练各种新工具、新技术操作手一百二十人，同时先后组织了五次现场会，推广和交流了先进的施工经验。全公社各个工地四千七百一十六名水利大军，11月19日完成土方六万一千三百零八方，平均工效近十三方，比大搞工具改革前的平均工效提高了五、六倍。
    在高工效竞赛中，各大队互相帮助，共同提高。当米山大队每人每天平均工效已达五方时，大塘大队还只达到四方，米山大队立即派木工帮他们改进了三十多部牛拉车，使大塘大队的平均工效提高到八点四方。大塘大队也派技术员到米山水库工地传授爆破取土经验，使米山大队的平均工效由七方跃到十二点四方。
    这个公社完工的工程经县水利局和公社党委验收、鉴定，质量完全符合标准。
