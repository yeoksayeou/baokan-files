"Pockmarked Horse Ditch" is the nickname for Qianyuan Town, the location of the Xingnong People's Commune in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province. As the name suggests, it was a poor place. After liberation, production and living standards here, like in other parts of the country, greatly improved. After the people's communes were established, the pace of agricultural mechanization accelerated. Currently, the entire commune has 38 mixed sets of tractors and 87 pieces (sets) of nine types of machine-drawn farm implements. Mechanized farming accounts for more than 50% of the area. About one-third of the main agricultural tasks such as plowing, sowing, weeding, harvesting, threshing, and transportation are now done by machines, greatly improving labor efficiency. The average male and female laborer here produces more than 10,800 catties of grain per year, and the average agricultural population owns more than 3,800 catties of grain, of which 61.3% is commodity grain. The shameful hat of "Pockmarked Horse Ditch" has been removed, and replaced by the glorious name: "Iron Ox Commune."

	Did Eleven Years' Work in One Year
In the past, working with a curved plow held back many strong people, preventing them from fully utilizing their strength. Today, people here have started to use machines for farming, greatly enhancing the role of humans. Zhang Zhixian, an ordinary farmer, drives a 45-horsepower tractor and completes the main agricultural tasks in one year that would have taken eleven years using horses and old farm tools. He proudly says, "The time it takes me to smoke a cigarette is enough for a curved plow to work for a whole day." Commune member Xu De vividly described the scene of using machines for threshing: "Last year, when threshing soybeans, the soybean stalks were more than four feet thick and almost buried me. I thought, this won't work, the horses will get stuck! Oh boy, here comes the tractor pulling the roller,轰轰轰 for a while, and in less than the time it takes to eat a meal, it threshed a field, with soybean grains a foot thick. People don't sweat and horses don't get tired, it's truly divine power!" The word "divine power" is perfectly appropriate to describe the power of machines. No wonder the commune members say: "With tractors, men and women smile happily."

Using machines for farming has opened up a wide world for women to participate in agricultural production. Not to mention the "March 8th" chartered vehicle team of the young girl Wang Xiuzhen, which completed tasks that were difficult for any strong laborer to accomplish in the past, even ordinary women can now do many of the tasks that previously required strong labor. During wheat threshing, they work around the threshing machine, talking and laughing, as nimble as swallows, passing wheat bundles, filling bags, weighing...almost all of them are women. People say: "Today's women dare to ride on machines and work, they are really capable!"

Listen to the praises of the elderly:

"It's a blessing to have tractors for farming! When we worked back then, we were so tired that our backs ached and our legs hurt, and we couldn't even get onto the kang at night."

"Two legs ran after four legs, and we had to carry bags weighing dozens of catties. When the horses got tired, people had to pull the plow."

"Now, planting and weeding, we sit on the machines, it's so comfortable. Hey! We can even smoke and chat, it's wonderful, and we are so happy."

"After work, we go to the canteen to eat, and after eating, we lie on the warm kang, so comfortable, listening to the radio, and we know when it's windy and rainy, we've really become living gods."

Isn't it so, from "two legs chasing four legs" to "sitting on the machines to work," what a remarkable change! In the past, farmers didn't even dare to think about it, but now, under the leadership of the Party, it has become a living reality. This is truly a world-shaking event.

	Won the Time
Xingnong People's Commune is located at 48 degrees north latitude, with a frost-free period of only about 125 days. Getting the grain in this short period of time has been a serious problem throughout history. Although there is vast fertile land here, due to the large area and the lack of labor and livestock (each male laborer cultivates an average of 62 mu of land, and each livestock is responsible for an average of 96 mu), agricultural time was missed, resulting in reduced production. The fifteen to twenty days before and after "Xiaoman" are the best time for sowing, but every year it has to be dragged past "Mangzhong" before the land can be sown. In order to seize the time, primitive sowing methods such as "one plow squeeze," "leaning on the mountain rake," and "fluffy chicken" have to be used. People helplessly say to the land: "Let's just sow it somehow, if I harvest it, it's mine, if I don't harvest it, it's yours." In this way, some land is not sown every year. Summer weeding is even more urgent. Commune members describe weeding as: "First pass embroidery, second pass horse racing, third pass chasing rabbits." This means that there is still time to be careful when weeding the first time, but the second and third times you have to weed as quickly as possible. Every year, because the weeding is not thorough, the weeds in many fields grow to be as tall as a person, but what can be done! In autumn, they are worried and afraid that the weather will change. Even if the crops are growing well, a frost will cause the sorghum grains to not open their eyes and the soybean pods to not turn green, and everything will be over. A heavy snow will leave everything in the fields. People say: "We don't even dare to look at the wasted grain!" Therefore, every year they hope for a "Zilaoshan" (a longer autumn tail, allowing the crops to grow and mature in the fields), but it is rare to have a "Zilaoshan" every year. Threshing often cannot be completed in one winter and has to be dragged into the spring of the following year. In the freezing weather, the grain is damaged and people suffer from the cold.

The establishment of the commune, the implementation of the General Line, and the leap-forward development of mechanical operation, people have won the time, seized the initiative, and have the power to order nature to hand over abundant grain in these short 120 days. Mechanical operation itself is more precise than old-fashioned plowing, and the labor and livestock freed up by mechanical operation are mostly invested in farmland processing and adding measures. This has led to a huge change in agricultural production: "four timeliness" (plowing, sowing, summer weeding, and harvesting). Last autumn, machine and animal power deep plowing reached more than 73% of the total area, changing the habit of never deep plowing. This spring, wheat was sown in seven and a half days and major field crops in half a month, about 20 days earlier than in previous years, achieving timeliness and fundamentally eliminating the previous primitive farming methods. Machine farming freed up a large amount of labor, so it was possible to carry out large-scale fertilizer accumulation and delivery at the same time as the tense spring sowing, making the fertilization area account for 75%, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu reached 4,200 catties, an increase of 36.8% compared with 1958. Summer weeding was carried out four times in forty days, with no land left uncultivated. This year, there was spring drought and autumn flooding. Due to the deep plowing of the land, the drought and flood resistance was strong, and the crops were better than in previous years. During the busy "double rush" season, as soon as the wheat was harvested, the tractor took the machine-drawn plow and deeply plowed the wheat fields, preparing for a bumper harvest in agricultural production next year. In the threshing yard, the tractor drives the threshing machine, day and night; on the road, dust rises, and the tractor drives the trailer, transporting wheat into the warehouse. In this way, even before the autumn crops began to be harvested, the commune members freed up one hand to dig potatoes, cut millet, pull rice beans, dry vegetables, and complete sporadic tasks, and prepared for the harvesting of large fields.

	Old Yellow Cattle "Transferred"
In the non-staple food store in Baiquan Town, you can buy "pure fat condensed milk" produced by the Xingnong People's Commune condensed milk factory. The Xingnong People's Commune really does not have dairy cows, so where does the milk come from? Is it transported from other places to be processed here? No, it is produced by the old yellow cattle in the commune. With the increase in the degree of mechanical operation, the old yellow cattle that cultivate the land have been "transferred" to produce milk.

The increased proportion of mechanical operation has also freed up more than 1,000 laborers, 47 carts, and more than 300 horses from agricultural production. It is these forces that have established commune industries from scratch, developed diversified operations, engaged in basic construction, and promoted the overall development of the commune's economy. Now the commune has established 19 small iron and wood factories, power plants, machinery repair shops, and soil fertilizer plants, and has established 122 small factories for rice making, condensed milk, flour making, brewing, brick and tile making, weaving, and clothing, forming a social, regional, and team-run industrial network, with a total annual output value of 220,000 yuan. In order to adapt to the great development of animal husbandry, 10,000-chicken farms, livestock farms, etc. have been built. The overall development of the commune's economy has accumulated funds for the greater development of agricultural mechanization.

	Farmers Can Master Machines
Who to rely on to engage in agricultural mechanization? Can farmers master machines? On this issue, there is a struggle between two ideologies and two roads.

Some people say: "Operating machines for farming is a science. Many experts have not done well. Handing it over to rough farmers is simply nonsense. This will bury the machines."

The Xingnong People's Commune has proved in the process of using machines that the masses can use machines. Of course, they also encountered difficulties. For thousands of years, farmers who used livestock for farming have now started using machines. This is indeed a great historical change, and it is not surprising to encounter some difficulties. Many people among the farmers are smart. After diligent study, they quickly became the masters of the machines. Qin Yukun, the branch secretary of Xingye Management Area, goes to the field with the tractor during the day and sleeps with the tractor at night. His wife said he was "fascinated" by the tractor. He figured out the "temper" of the tractor in less than three months. Tan Yuyou, the machinery director of Shoulin Management Area, who was a pigherd in the old society, has now become an expert. He is very familiar with many problems in mechanical operation.

The commune also opened a tractor school, training 260 technicians. The "boss" who drives the big carts and the daughter of the poor peasant family can drive the tractor on the field. In terms of operation and management, Xingnong Commune has already figured out a set of systems such as "three guarantees" (guarantee tasks, guarantee fuel, guarantee repair costs), "three fixings" (fix personnel, fix machinery, fix plots), "three insurances" (guarantee time, guarantee quality, guarantee safety), and saving rewards. The efficiency of the locomotive is constantly improving, and the cost is constantly decreasing. They have also further created and modified soil-foreign-combined towed farm implements such as "machine-drawn old plows" based on the shortage of towed farm implements.

    “癞马沟”成为“铁牛社”
     于振瀛
    “癞马沟”是黑龙江省拜泉县兴农人民公社所在地——乾元镇的绰号。顾名思义，这是个穷困的地方。解放后，这里生产生活同全国各地一样，有了很大程度的提高。人民公社化后，又加快了农业机械化的速度。目前全社有拖拉机三十八个混合台，机引农具九种共八十七台（件），机耕面积已占50％以上；翻地、播种、锄草、秋收、脱谷、运输等主要农活，已有三分之一左右由机械作业，劳动效率大大提高了。这里的男女劳动力平均一年生产粮食一万零八百多斤，每个农业人口平均占有粮食三千八百多斤，其中商品粮占61.3％。“癞马沟”这顶不光采的帽子摘掉了，而代替它的是光荣的名字：“铁牛社”。
      一年干了十一年的活
    过去用弯勾犁干活，拖住了多少强壮的人，使他们的力量无从发挥出来；今天，在这里，人们开始使用机器耕作了，人的作用大大提高了。张志贤这个普通的农民，他驾驶着四十五马力的拖拉机，一年干的主要农活，要是换成马拉旧农具，得干上十一年。他自豪地说：“我抽一根烟的工夫，就够弯勾犁干一天的了。”社员许德眉飞色舞地述说用机器脱粒时的情形：“去年打黄豆，豆秸铺了四尺多厚，都要把我埋住了；我寻思，这哪能行，马进去还不得陷住！哦喝，好家伙，拖拉机拉着镇压器上来了，轰?了一阵，不到一顿饭的工夫，就打出一铺场，豆粒有一尺来厚，人不出汗马不乏，真是神力啊！”“神力”二字，用来称赞机器的威力，再恰当不过了。怪不得社员们说：“有了拖拉机，男女笑迷迷。”
    使用机器耕作，给妇女参加农业生产开辟了广阔的天地。且不讲青年姑娘王秀珍的“三八”包车组，完成了过去任何强劳动力也难以完成的活，就拿一般妇女来说，过去非强劳动力干不了的活，有许多现在她们也能干了。小麦脱谷的时候，她们在脱谷机四围，有说有笑地劳动着，像燕子般灵巧，递麦捆，装袋子，过秤……几乎全是妇女。人们说：“现在的妇女，敢骑到机器上边干活，可真有能耐！”
    请听老人的赞美吧：
    “有了拖拉机干活，真享大福了！咱们那时候干活，累的腰酸腿疼，到晚上连炕都上不去。”
    “两条腿跟着四条腿跑，还得扛着几十斤重的口袋；马累倒了，就得人拉犁。”
    “现在种地、蹚地，坐在机器上边干，真自在透了。嘿！还能抽烟、唠喀呢，美滋滋，乐呵呵的。”
    “干完活到食堂就吃饭，吃完饭往热炕上一躺，舒舒服服的，听着广播，刮风下雨都知道，真成了活神仙了。”
    可不是吗，从“两条腿跟四条腿跑”，到“坐在机器上边干”，多么了不起的变化啊！过去农民连想都不敢想，现在在党的领导下，变成了活生生的现实，这真是翻天复地的大事。
          赢得了时间
    兴农人民公社，地处北纬四十八度，无霜期只有一百二十五天左右。在这短促的时间内，要把粮食拿到手，是有史以来的严重问题。这里虽然有广阔的肥沃土地，可是由于地多人少，劳畜力不足（每个男劳动力平均耕地六十二亩，每匹牲畜平均负担九十六亩），以致违误农时，造成减产。“小满”前后的十五到二十天内，正是播种的好时机，但是每年都要拖过“芒种”才能种完地。为了抢时机，不得不用“一犁挤”、“靠山耲”、“翻毛鸡”等原始的播种方法，人们无可奈何地对着土地说：“好歹种上吧，收了是我的，不收是你的。”就这样，每年总还有些地种不上。夏锄更紧张，社员形容铲地是：“头遍绣花，二遍跑马，三遍打兔子”。这就是说，铲头遍还有工夫细心点干，二遍三遍就得紧铲紧扔。年年因为铲得不细，不少地里的蒿草长得一人来深，但这有什么办法呢！一到秋天，担惊受怕，怕天气一变，庄稼明明长得挺好，一场秋霜，高粱粒不睁眼睛，黄豆荚没褪青，就完蛋了；一场大雪，就都扔在地里。人们说：“糟蹋的粮食都不敢睁眼看啊！”因此，年年盼望有个“自老山”（秋尾巴长一些，让庄稼在地里长成熟一些），年年却难得有“自老山”。打场往往一冬打不完，要拖到第二年春天，冰天雪地，真是粮食遭损人受冻。
    公社的建立，总路线的贯彻执行，机械操作程度的飞跃发展，人们已经赢得了时机，夺取了主动，有力量喝令大自然在这短促的一百二十几天内，交出丰硕的粮食。机械作业本身就比旧式犁耕的精细，再加上机械作业腾出的劳畜力，大部分投入农田加工，增添措施，这就在农业生产上出现了“四及时”（翻地、播种、夏锄、收获）的巨大变化。去年秋天，机器加畜力深翻地达到总面积的73％以上，改变了从来不深翻地的习惯。今年春天播种，七天半种完小麦，半个月种完大田，比往年提前二十天左右，做到了适时，并且从根本上消灭了以往那些原始的耕作方法。机器耕作，腾出了大批劳力，所以能在紧张的春播同时，大搞积肥送粪，使施肥面积占75％，每亩施肥量达到四千二百斤，比1958年增加36.8％。夏锄在四十天内进行了四铲四蹚，没荒一亩地。今年春旱秋涝，由于土地深翻，抗旱抗涝力强，庄稼胜过往年。在繁忙的“双抢”季节，小麦刚刚收完，拖拉机就带着机引犁，把麦田的土地深翻过来，为明年农业生产大丰收作好了准备。在场院里，拖拉机带动脱谷机，日夜不停的打麦；公路上烟尘四起，拖拉机带着拖车，运送小麦入仓。就这样，还在大秋作物开始收割之前，社员们就腾出一只手来，挖土豆，割糜子，拔饭豆，晒干菜，做完零星活计，并做好收割大田的各项准备工作。
        老黄牛“转业”
    在拜泉镇的副食品商店里，可以买到兴农人民公社炼乳厂出品的“纯脂炼乳”。兴农人民公社千真万确没有乳牛，那么牛奶是哪儿来的呢？是从外地运来这里加工的吗？不是，是公社里的老黄牛生产的。随着机械操作程度的提高，耕地的老黄牛“转业”生产牛奶了。
    机械作业的比重增大，还从农业生产上腾出一千来名劳动力、四十七台马车、三百多匹马。就是这些力量，从无到有的办起了公社工业，发展多种经营，搞基本建设，促进了公社经济的全面发展。现在公社建立了小型铁木厂、发电厂、机械修配所和制土化肥厂等十九处，办了制米、炼乳、制粉、酿酒、砖瓦、编织、被服等小型工厂一百二十二处，形成了社、区、队办的工业网，全年总产值可达二十二万元。为适应畜牧业大发展，修盖了万鸡场、畜牧场等。公社经济的全面发展，又为农业机械化的更大发展积累了资金。
        农民能够掌握机械
    依靠谁来搞农业机械化事业？农民能不能掌握机械？在这个问题上，有着两种思想两条道路的斗争。
    有人说：“操作机械耕作是门科学，很多专家都没搞好，交给粗手毛脚的老农民，简直是胡闹，这会把机车葬送了。”
    兴农人民公社在使用机器的过程中，证明群众是能够使用机械的。当然，他们也遇到了困难。几千年用牲畜耕作的农民，使用起机器来了，这的确是历史的大转变，遇到些困难有什么可奇怪的呢？在农民之中有许多人是聪明的，他们经过勤学苦钻，很快就成为机器的主人。兴业管理区支部书记秦玉坤，白天和拖拉机一起下田，晚上和拖拉机睡在一起，他妻子说他：“这是叫拖拉机‘迷’住了。”他没用上三个月，就摸透了拖拉机的“脾气”。守林管理区的机务主任谭玉有，这个旧社会的小猪倌，现在已经成为专家了，他对机械操作中的许多问题非常熟悉。
    公社还开办了拖拉机学校，培训出技术人员二百六十名，赶大车的“老板子”，贫农家的女儿，都能驾驶着拖拉机在田野里奔驰了。在经营管理方面，兴农公社已经摸出了“三包”（包任务、包油料、包修理费）、“三定”（定人员、定机具、定地块）、“三保”（保时间、保质量、保安全）和节约奖励等一套制度，机车效率不断提高，成本不断下降。他们还进一步根据拖带农具不足的情况，创造和改制了  “机引旧犁”等土洋结合的拖带农具。
