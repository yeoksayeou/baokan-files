Xinhua News Agency, 19th: More than 160,000 housewives in Beijing have joined street production organizations, becoming a new force in the city's socialist construction.

Since the Great Leap Forward last year, Beijing has established more than 590 street factories, more than 1,700 production groups, and more than 1,200 service and repair units. These street production organizations are increasingly playing the role of supplementary and assistants to large-scale industry. In August of this year, 20% of the total output value of the Xuanwu Clothing Products Factory was completed by street production organizations. In terms of processing capacity, these street production organizations were equivalent to adding 200 factory buildings, 210 sewing machines, and 600 workers to this local state-owned factory. The Xicheng District Erlong Road Street Paint Factory used self-made thinner to supply the needs of 55 units including the Xuanwu Electric Motor Factory. The Guang'anmenwai Street Metal Processing Factory can make various screw fittings. Some of the screws used in the blast furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company are made by them.

The city's street industry is now able to produce more than 400 kinds of daily industrial products, from hats to shoes, from clothes to stoves. According to statistics from relevant departments, more than 20,000 housewives in street production organizations are engaged in shoe-making, more than 10,000 are engaged in sewing, and more than 6,000 are engaged in the production of daily metal products and small commodities. A large number of housewives are also engaged in production labor in industries such as textiles, knitting, binding and paper products, and cultural supplies. Many service and repair organizations run by the streets are responsible for mending and washing clothes and repairing houses and furniture, which are welcomed by residents.

After a year of development, rectification, consolidation, and improvement, the variety and output of products from Beijing's street production organizations have been increasing, the quality has been significantly improved, and the cost has been decreasing. The total output value and processing fees were nearly 5 million yuan in August, rose to more than 8 million yuan in September, and jumped to nearly 10 million yuan in October. Some street production organizations have vigorously carried out technological innovation and created some simple equipment, which has greatly improved production efficiency. Several housewives in the Qianmen Luanqing United Processing Factory created a simple mouth-heating machine to replace manual production of paper boxes for traditional Chinese medicine, which increased production efficiency four times.

The organizational forms of street production have also developed according to various different situations. Originally, most of them took a decentralized form, allowing women participating in production to take work home to do. This form is suitable for the characteristics of housewives, and some street production organizations still take this form. Some street production organizations have found suitable factory buildings, and because nurseries and canteens have been gradually organized on the streets, they have developed into centralized production groups or processing factories, which facilitates strengthening enterprise management and improving the political and technical level of production personnel.

After housewives participated in production, their income increased, and their mental outlook also changed greatly. In collective life and labor exercises, their political consciousness has rapidly improved. Li Suzhen, a housewife who used to be preoccupied with the kitchen stove a year ago, participated in political, cultural, and technical studies in the street factory while participating in production, and enthusiastically ran the factory's social welfare undertakings. Now she is the deputy director of the second workshop of the Erlong Road Street Paint Factory, and also serves as the director of the factory's women's work committee. Not long ago, she gloriously attended the National Congress of Heroes.

### 充当大工业的助手　满足人民生活需要  北京街道生产组织越办越好  十六万家庭妇女参加社会劳动成为建设中的新生力量

    充当大工业的助手　满足人民生活需要
    北京街道生产组织越办越好
    十六万家庭妇女参加社会劳动成为建设中的新生力量
    新华社19日讯　北京市有十六万多名家庭妇女参加街道生产组织，成为全市社会主义建设的一支新的力量。
    去年大跃进以来，北京市办起了五百九十多个街道工厂、一千七百多个生产组和一千二百多个服务修理单位。这些街道生产组织日益发挥出大工业的补充和助手的作用。地方国营宣武服装制品厂今年8月份的生产总值，有20％就是由街道生产组织加工完成的，这些街道生产组织以加工能力计算，等于为这个地方国营工厂增加了二百间厂房、二百一十台缝纫机和六百名工人。西城区二龙路街道喷漆厂，用自制成功的稀料供应了宣武电机厂等五十五个单位的需要。广安门外街道金属加工厂能做各种螺丝配件，石景山钢铁公司高炉上用的一些螺丝就是他们做的。
    全市街道工业现在已能生产四百多种日用工业品，从帽子到鞋子，从衣服到火炉都生产。据有关部门统计，在街道生产组织中有两万多名家庭妇女从事制鞋，有一万多人从事缝纫，还有六千多人在生产日用金属品、小百货。在纺织、针织、装订和纸制品、文化用品等行业，也有大批家庭妇女在从事生产劳动。许多街道举办的服务修理组织，担负着修补拆洗衣服和修缮房屋、家具等零活，受到了居民的欢迎。
    经过一年来的发展、整顿、巩固和提高，北京市街道生产组织的产品品种、产量与日俱增，质量显著提高，成本日益降低。生产总值和加工费，8月份近五百万元，9月份上升到八百多万元，10月份又跃进到近一千万元。有些街道生产组织大闹技术革新，创造出一些简易设备，使生产效率大大提高。前门銮庆联合加工厂的几个家庭妇女，创造出一种简易烫口机，代替手工制作装中药用的纸盒，生产效率提高了四倍。
    街道生产的组织形式，也根据各种不同情况有了发展。原来多是采取分散的形式，让参加生产的妇女把活带回家去做。这种形式适合家庭妇女的特点，现在还有一部分街道生产组织采取这种形式。有一些街道生产组织因为找到了适当的厂房，并且由于街道上逐渐组织起了托儿所、食堂，已经发展成为集中的生产组或加工厂，这样就便于加强企业管理和提高生产人员的政治、技术水平。
    家庭妇女参加生产后，收入增加了，精神面貌也有了很大改变。她们在集体生活和劳动锻炼中，政治觉悟迅速提高。一年前还是围着锅台转的家庭妇女李素珍，参加生产的同时参加了街道工厂的政治文化学习和技术学习，热心举办厂里的社会福利事业，现在她已经是二龙路街道喷漆厂二车间的副主任，并且兼任这个工厂的妇女工作委员会主任，不久前光荣地出席了全国群英会。
