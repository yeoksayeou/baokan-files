    Launch a Cultural Learning Upsurge This Winter and Next Spring
    National Rural Literacy and Spare-Time Education Work Conference Makes Decision
    Fully Utilize Favorable Opportunities, Closely Coordinate with Production Upsurge
    Maximize Mobilization of Youth to Study, Consolidate and Improve Spare-Time Schools

The rural literacy and spare-time education work conference convened by the Ministry of Education, lasting ten days, concluded victoriously on the 4th. This was a mobilization meeting for continuing the vigorous literacy campaign and vigorously developing spare-time education in rural areas nationwide this winter and next spring. The conference was attended by heads of education departments and bureaus from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Based on opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, unifying understanding, and raising ideological awareness, the conference discussed plans to complete the task of eliminating illiteracy among rural young and middle-aged people within two to three years, and to vigorously establish spare-time schools. It was decided that, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the favorable opportunities this winter and next spring should be fully utilized to closely coordinate with the current production upsurge, maximize the mobilization of semi-literate and illiterate youth to participate in learning, organize young and middle-aged people who became literate last year to participate in spare-time elementary school learning, and consolidate the continued learning of young and middle-aged people who have already joined spare-time schools. A large-scale mass learning upsurge should be launched in the countryside.

The conference studied relevant documents and listened to the report made by Vice Premier Lu Dingyi at the Heroes' Congress on "Opposing Right-Leaning Tendencies, Boosting Morale, Coordinating with the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, and Vigorously Engaging in Cultural Revolution." Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Chen Zhengren, Deputy Minister of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, Hu Keshi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Guo Mingqiu, member of the Presidium of the All-China Women's Federation, attended the meeting and spoke on how to carry out literacy campaigns and spare-time education in rural areas, and how to mobilize young people and women to actively participate in learning. Vice Minister of Education Dong Chuncai gave a summary of the meeting.

The conference first discussed and analyzed the current situation, believing that the current great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has brought extremely favorable conditions for the development of cultural and educational undertakings. To realize the requirements put forward by the Party Central Committee for the mechanization, water conservancy, electrification, and chemicalization of agricultural development, there must be a large number of agricultural technicians, and the political, cultural, and technical level of the broad masses of peasants must also be improved. Therefore, how to rapidly improve the cultural and technical level of the broad masses of peasants and train a large number of agricultural technicians is a major task of current educational work. The conference believes that culture is a necessary condition for improving technology. To realize the cultural revolution, it is necessary to first eliminate illiteracy, and at the same time, vigorously establish spare-time schools for peasants, with the aim of gradually popularizing spare-time elementary education among peasants. This is a combat task. Educational workers must set high aspirations, oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and bravely undertake the glorious task of making hundreds of millions of young and middle-aged peasants "laborers with socialist consciousness and culture" in the shortest possible time.

The conference pointed out that the literacy campaign in 1958, under the illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction and the leadership of Party committees at all levels, achieved unprecedentedly great results. Last year, more than 100 million young and middle-aged people across the country participated in literacy learning, of which more than 50 million got rid of illiteracy, more than twice the total number of people made literate in the previous eight years. This fact proves that literacy work can also be carried out at high speed. The great call made by Chairman Mao in 1955 to eliminate illiteracy in five to seven years can be completely achieved and must be achieved.

The conference believes that literacy and spare-time education are the educational cause of hundreds of millions of people. It is necessary to extensively rely on the masses, adopt the method of mass movement, follow the mass line, and must be closely integrated with production and serve production. This is also the key to smoothly carrying out literacy campaigns and spare-time education. The conference pointed out that in the large-scale mass learning movement this winter and next spring, it is necessary to learn from last year's experience, use various propaganda tools to vigorously carry out propaganda and mobilization, and improve the consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses to participate in learning and running schools; convene meetings of activists, hold on-site meetings, cultivate typical examples, establish pacesetters, and promptly organize inspections and appraisals to continuously promote the movement forward; after the formation of a learning upsurge, the experience of "grasping tightly and arranging skillfully" should also be learned to make the movement develop continuously and healthily, combining crash learning with regular learning, and achieving more learning in slack times and less learning in busy times.

The conference criticized various right-leaning ideas in carrying out mass literacy campaigns and spare-time education work, believing that right-leaning ideas are the biggest obstacle to carrying out literacy campaigns and spare-time education work at present and must be opposed. The conference pointed out that the Party's requirements for the "four modernizations" of agricultural development, as well as the rich experience accumulated in literacy and spare-time education last year, have created more favorable conditions for carrying out literacy campaigns this year. As long as the national spare-time education workers oppose right-leaning ideas, clear the obstacles to advancement, boost their morale under the leadership of the Party, rely on the masses, and mobilize all positive factors, they will surely achieve even more brilliant achievements.

The conference also particularly emphasized that literacy and spare-time education work must be carried out under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels.

    今冬明春掀起学习文化高潮
    全国农村扫盲和业余教育工作会议作出决定
    充分利用有利时机  密切配合生产高潮
    尽量动员青年学习  巩固提高业余学校
    新华社5日讯　教育部召开的为期十天的农村扫盲和业余教育工作会议，4日胜利结束。这是今冬明春在全国农村中继续开展轰轰烈烈的扫盲运动和大力开展业余教育工作的动员大会。参加会议的有各省、市、自治区教育厅、局负责人。会议在反右倾，鼓干劲，统一认识，提高思想的基础上，讨论了两、三年内完成扫除农村青壮年文盲的任务、大办业余学校的规划，并决定在各级党委领导下，充分利用今冬明春的有利时机，密切配合当前生产高潮，尽量动员半文盲和文盲青年参加学习，组织去年脱盲青壮年参加业余初等学校学习，巩固已参加业余学校的青壮年继续学习。在农村里掀起一个大规模的群众学习高潮。
    会议学习了有关文件，听取了陆定一副总理在群英大会上所作的“反右倾、鼓干劲，配合增产节约运动，大搞文化革命”的报告。全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长林枫、中共中央农村工作部副部长陈正人、共产主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡克实、全国妇女联合会主席团委员郭明秋等，都到会就如何在农村中开展扫盲运动和业余教育、如何发动青年和妇女积极参加学习等问题作了发言。会议由教育部董纯才副部长作总结。
    会议首先讨论分析了当前的形势，认为当前工农业生产的大跃进，为发展文化教育事业带来了极为有利的条件。为实现党中央提出的农业发展机械化、水利化、电气化、化学化的要求，必须有大量的农业技术人员，同时还要提高广大农民群众的政治文化技术水平。因此，如何迅速提高广大农民的文化技术水平和培养大量农业技术人员，是当前教育工作的重大任务。会议认为，文化是提高技术的必要条件。要实现文化革命必须首先扫除文盲，同时大办农民业余学校，以期在农民中逐步普及业余初等教育，这是一项战斗任务。教育工作者必须立大志，反右倾，鼓干劲，勇敢地担负起使亿万青壮年农民在尽可能短的时期内成为“有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者”的光荣任务。
    会议指出：1958年扫盲运动在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下和各级党委的领导下，获得空前巨大的成绩，去年全国参加扫盲学习的青壮年达一亿以上，其中摆脱文盲状态的达五千万人以上，为前八年扫盲人数总和的两倍多。这一事实证明：扫盲工作也是可以高速度进行的，1955年毛主席提出五至七年扫除文盲的伟大号召，是完全可以做到的，而且一定要做到。
    会议认为，扫盲和业余教育是几亿人民群众的教育事业，必须广泛依靠群众，采取群众运动、走群众路线的方法来进行，并且必须密切结合生产，为生产服务，这又是顺利开展扫盲运动和业余教育的关键。会议指出今冬明春大规模开展群众学习运动中，必须学习去年的经验，利用各种宣传工具，大张旗鼓地进行宣传动员，提高群众参加学习和办学的自觉性和积极性；召开积极分子会议，举行现场会议，培养典型，树立标兵，及时组织检查、评比，不断推动运动向前发展；在学习高潮形成后，还应学习“紧抓、巧安排”的经验，使运动持续、健康地发展下去，把突击学习与经常学习结合起来，做到闲时多学，忙时少学。
    会议批判了开展群众性扫盲运动和业余教育工作中的各种右倾思想，认为右倾思想是当前开展扫盲运动和业余教育工作的最大障碍，必须反掉。会议指出，党提出的农业发展“四化”的要求，以及去年积累的丰富的扫盲和业余教育经验，为今年开展扫盲运动创造了更为有利的条件。全国业余教育工作者只要反掉右倾思想，扫清前进的障碍，在党的领导下鼓足干劲，依靠群众，调动一切积极因素，必然会取得更辉煌的成就。
    会议还特别强调了扫盲和业余教育工作必须在各级党委统一领导下进行。
