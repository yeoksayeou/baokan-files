Studying Lenin's Theoretical Legacy
	Zhang Zhongshi

	The Russian fourth edition of the "Complete Works of Lenin" has published the first thirty-eight volumes, and by the end of September this year, all of them have been translated into Chinese and published. This is a precious gift jointly presented by the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the People's Publishing House, and the Xinhua Printing Factory to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China after a year of hard work and close collaboration. This is also a significant achievement for our country in disseminating Lenin's works.

	Lenin was the genius leader of the world's proletariat and all progressive humanity, the great successor to the revolutionary doctrines of Marx and Engels, and the creator of Marxism-Leninism in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution. He created the world's first new type of proletarian party—the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He organized the great socialist revolution and founded the world's first socialist state—the Soviet Union.

	Among the ideological weapons of the proletarian revolution, Leninism is the sharpest. In his works, Lenin expounded on all the fundamental issues of the proletarian struggle, such as philosophy, political economy, history, theory, organization, party program, strategy, and tactics, and waged an irreconcilable struggle against all kinds of opportunism, defending Marxism. Lenin raised Marxism to a new and higher stage, creatively developing it, enriching it with new revolutionary principles and revolutionary experience. Lenin's works played a huge role in establishing a new type of Marxist party, in striving for the victory of the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, in establishing the world's first Soviet state and socialist society, and in inspiring and developing the liberation movement of oppressed nations. Lenin's works are a model of the strict and high scientificity combined with revolutionary spirit. They have an irresistible attraction for socialists in all countries. Therefore, Lenin's works are a precious treasure for the world's proletariat and progressive humanity.

	Precisely for this reason, the Soviet people and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union attach great importance to the dissemination of Lenin's works. From the victory of the October Socialist Revolution to 1956, the Russian edition of the "Complete Works of Lenin" had been compiled and printed four times. Since 1957, the fifth edition has been compiled and printed.

	The first Russian edition of the "Complete Works of Lenin" was started in 1920 based on the decision of the Ninth Congress of the Russian Communist Party to commemorate Lenin's fiftieth birthday, and it was published in full by 1926. This was the first attempt to publish Lenin's works in the form of a collection of articles. This edition has a total of twenty volumes, mainly compiling some works that have already been published, a total of about 1,500 articles, divided into twenty-six books. Because some volumes were too thick, they were divided into two volumes. On December 18, 1925, Stalin made a high evaluation of the significance of the publication of the "Complete Works of Lenin" in the "Political Report to the Fourteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party." He said: "We are fortunate that we have published many editions of some of Lenin's works. Now people are reading, studying, and beginning to understand the issues. Not only the party leaders, but also the ordinary party members are beginning to understand the issues, and they are no longer deceived. Now the clamor of degeneration can't scare anyone. People can judge the issues themselves. No matter how someone clamors, no matter how someone scares people with citations, the ordinary party members can judge after listening, because now they all have Lenin's works in their hands. This fact is a fundamental guarantee that our party will not deviate from the path of Leninism." The first edition of the "Complete Works of Lenin" did not include many of Lenin's treatises and many other works and letters published in Bolshevik newspapers; the works were not arranged according to the year of publication, and some were compiled according to topics.

	Therefore, shortly after Lenin's death (January 1924), the Second Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union (late January 1924) and the Thirteenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (late May 1924), in order to commemorate Lenin, decided to compile and print the second and third editions of the "Complete Works of Lenin" at the same time from 1925. The resolution of the Second Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union stated: "The best way to commemorate Lenin is to widely disseminate his works and make communist ideas the property of all laborers." The two editions have the same content, but different layouts. The whole book was published in full by 1932, with a total of thirty volumes; the first 27 volumes are works, volumes 28 and 29 are letters, and the last volume (volume 30) is a supplement. The content of these two editions is more substantial, adding 1,265 new works compared to the first edition, including about 500 letters and a large number of papers that had been published anonymously or under pen names in the legal and underground publications of the Bolsheviks. However, these two editions have not yet included all of Lenin's large number of works and letters; and according to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the annotations in the appendices and commentaries of some volumes also "committed the most blatant political errors of sabotage." (See "Resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on How to Carry Out Party Propaganda Work Due to the Publication of the 'Concise Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)'")

	Therefore, in November 1938, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided to reprint the fourth edition of the "Complete Works of Lenin." The fourth edition has a total of forty-three volumes, and the first two volumes were published in 1941. The publication was suspended due to the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War, but the preparatory work continued. After the end of the war, the publication resumed from 1946, and by the end of 1958, volumes 1 to 38 had been published. This edition includes a total of 2,927 works, adding many new documents that are not known to readers, including 501 documents that are included in the Complete Works for the first time. In terms of content, volumes 1 to 33 are monographs, papers, speeches, and reports; volumes 34 to 35 are letters and telegrams; volumes 36 to 43 are supplements, of which volume 36 is some works that were originally included in the second and third editions but were not included in the fourth edition and some papers that were published for the first time; volume 37 is "Letters to Relatives"; volume 38 is "Philosophical Notebooks"; volume 39 is "Notebooks on Imperialism"; volume 40 is "Notebooks on the Land Question"; volumes 41 to 43 are manuscripts, notes, short essays, and reading summaries, etc. The last five volumes have not yet been published.

	For the convenience of reading and studying, in addition to the "Explanation of the Fourth Edition" (before the first volume), each volume has an explanation at the beginning of the volume, and annotations and a chronology of Lenin's life and activities during this period are attached at the end of the volume. The "Explanation of the Fourth Edition" briefly explains the significance of the publication of this edition and its differences from previous editions, reviews the newly added works, and explains the principles of compilation and the content of reference materials. The "Explanation" of each volume introduces the works of that period included in this volume, explains the content of important works, and indicates the new works added to this edition. The "Annotations" note the political situation of an event or person or the source of the quotation, some are placed at the end of the book, and some are footnotes. The "Chronology of Lenin's Life and Activities" records important events, Lenin's revolutionary activities, the writing or first publication time of a certain work, the date of Lenin's speech, report, speech, and participation in a certain congress, etc. These materials are supplements to Lenin's biography, and readers can get help from them when studying Lenin's works or biography.

	Although the fourth edition has the above-mentioned advantages, according to Pankratova's speech at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, some articles and letters compiled in the second and third editions and the "Lenin Collection" were not included in the fourth edition; some important notes and other works of Lenin were omitted (later, the fourth edition added supplements to make up for these shortcomings.); in addition, the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided in February 1957 to reprint the fifth edition from this year, and it is planned to include all of Lenin's works that have been included or have not been collected in previous editions, including monographs, papers, speeches, report drafts, and reading summaries, etc., in fifty-five volumes. This latest version had only been published to the fourth volume by July 1959, so the fourth edition is still popular.

	Lenin's works have also been widely circulated in various countries. In addition to socialist countries such as our country, Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, North Korea, and the German Democratic Republic, Italy, France, Portugal, Norway, Greece, Japan, Argentina, and Brazil are also translating the Russian fourth edition of the "Complete Works of Lenin."

	Lenin's works shine like a beacon on the revolutionary road of the working people of all countries, and also on the revolutionary road of our people. At every stage of the development of our revolution, Lenin's ideas have been combined with the specific practice of our country through Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist skillful hands, armed the vast number of cadres of our party, and educated the broad masses of the people, so that the revolution has achieved one victory after another. Therefore, our party has attached great importance to the dissemination of Lenin's works in various periods, no matter what the conditions are.

	Comrade Mao Zedong said that the salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. After the victory of the October Revolution, Lenin's works were introduced by our country's revolutionary intellectuals at that time. In the two years of 1918 and 1919, our country's publications began to introduce the significance of the October Socialist Revolution and Lenin's biography. In 1920, some revolutionary and progressive publications, such as "New Youth," "The Communist," and "Dawn," successively published Lenin's works. At that time, the reports and papers introduced included "Report on the Party Program at the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party" (part), "Speech at the Ninth Congress of the Russian Communist Party," "Economics and Politics in the Era of the Proletarian Dictatorship," and "From Destroying the Old System of the Past to Creating a New System." Although the number of articles is not large, there is no doubt that these works of Lenin played a significant role in the development of Marxist groups in various places and the establishment of the Communist Party of China.

	On the eve of the founding of the Communist Party of China, in June 1921, Comrade Li Dazhao briefly described Lenin's life and his revolutionary activities in the article "The Past and Present of the Russian Revolution," and listed a catalog of Lenin's important works (nineteen kinds).

	After the founding of the Party in July 1921, more attention was paid to the dissemination of Lenin's works. The Party established the People's Publishing House in Shanghai. In addition to publishing several works by Marx and Lenin, it had prepared to translate and publish fifteen kinds of "Complete Works of Marx," fourteen kinds of "Complete Works of Lenin," and eleven kinds of "Communist Series." Due to the destruction of imperialists (concessions) and the suppression of the Chinese reactionary rule, these plans were not fully realized, and the People's Publishing House was later destroyed and sealed up.

	During the First Revolutionary Civil War, with the development of the revolution, Lenin's works were translated in large numbers. Within the four years from 1924 to 1927, twenty-three kinds of Lenin's works were translated into Chinese and published. Among them are famous works on the Chinese revolution, the national liberation movement in the colonies, and the strategic and tactical problems of the proletarian revolution, such as "Backward Europe and Advanced Asia," "Renewed China," "The Awakening of Asia," "The War in China," etc., and various parts of books such as "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," and "State and Revolution."

	During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, although the material conditions in the revolutionary base areas were extremely difficult and the white terror in the Kuomintang-ruled areas was exceptionally rampant, the Party persisted in overcoming various difficulties and expanded the dissemination of Marxist-Leninist classics. During this period, thirty-eight kinds of Lenin's monographs or collections of essays were translated and published. Important ones include "On Guerrilla Warfare," "Imperialism, the Last Stage of Capitalism," "Two Tactics," "State and Revolution," "The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky," "The Peasants and the Revolution," "From the February Revolution to the October Revolution," "The Three Internationals," "Karl Marx," "(Part of) Re-examining the Land Program of the Workers' Party," "The Peasant Problem in the Russian Revolution of 1905-1907 and the Land Program of the Social Democrats," "Materialism and Empiriocriticism," "The Development of Capitalism in Russia," "The Basic Tasks of the Communist Youth League," "Lenin 'On Tolstoy,'" and "Lenin's Collection of Family Letters," etc. Some of these works were published in the Jiangxi Central Soviet Area, and some were published in the Kuomintang-ruled areas.

	After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the Central Committee of the Party attached great importance to the propaganda work of Marxist-Leninist theory. In October 1938, the Central Committee of the Party decided to universally and deeply study Marxist-Leninist theory throughout the Party. In 1942, the Party again adopted the form of a rectification movement to conduct an in-depth Marxist-Leninist education throughout the Party, so that the Party cadres and members could recognize and overcome various bad tendencies within the Party, especially subjectivism, sectarianism, and the manifestations of these two tendencies—Party jargon. This Marxist-Leninist education movement of the Party—the rectification movement—greatly improved the political and ideological level of the Party, so that the Party's leading organs and leading cadres further grasped the basic direction of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. In order to meet this need, more and more of Lenin's works were introduced during this period. According to incomplete materials, from July 1937 to July 1945, a total of fifty-seven kinds of Lenin's works were published in various anti-Japanese base areas and the Kuomintang-ruled areas. The Central Committee of the Party established the "Liberation Press" in Yan'an, responsible for the planned publication of Marxist-Leninist classics. In addition to publishing Lenin's monographs and selected works, the "Liberation Press" also published the "Selected Works of Lenin" in twenty volumes. This was the first time that our country published Lenin's works in the form of a collection of articles. It is worth mentioning that the Party also published some of Lenin's works on war issues during this period, such as Lenin's "On Guerrilla Warfare," "Lenin's Notes on Reading On War," "Socialism and War," "Lenin on War," and "Lenin 'Clausewitz's On War' Notes," etc. It can be seen from this how much the Party valued Marxist-Leninist theory on war.

	During the Third Revolutionary Civil War, the dissemination of Marxist-Leninist classics was further expanded. A large number of translated versions of classic works were published in the liberated areas. During the four years of this period, a total of sixty-six kinds of Lenin's works were published. At the end of this period, in early 1949, in order to improve the Party's political and theoretical level and welcome the victory of the people's revolution throughout the country, the Central Committee of the Party stipulated ten kinds of Marxist, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin's classic works as "must-read for cadres," including Lenin's works: "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," "State and Revolution," "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder" and the book "Lenin and Stalin on China."

	The founding of the People's Republic of China created favorable conditions for the large-scale translation and publication of Marxist-Leninist classics. The Central Committee of the Party and the People's Government attach great importance to the ideological education of cadres and the popularization of political education among the people. The national publishing agency—the People's Publishing House—has become the center for publishing Marxist-Leninist classics. At this time, Lenin's works were published in even larger numbers. From October 1949 to the beginning of 1953, a total of seventy-two kinds of Lenin's works were printed within these three years. At this time, in addition to publishing the "Selected Works of Lenin" (two-volume set), the "Collected Works of Lenin" (six volumes), and many monographs by Lenin, the People's Publishing House also published various thematic collections of essays, such as "On Trade Unions," "On the State," "On Writers," "On China," and "On Socialist Economic Construction," etc.

	At the beginning of 1953, in order to translate Marxist-Leninist classics quickly and well, the Central Committee of the Party specially established the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Its main task is to translate "Complete Works of Marx and Engels," "Complete Works of Lenin," and "Complete Works of Stalin" in a planned and systematic way. Among them, the "Complete Works of Lenin" was translated according to the Russian fourth edition according to the decision of the Central Committee of the Party. In the past few years, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Party, the Compilation and Translation Bureau has made great achievements in carrying out this task. From the beginning of 1953 to June 1958, it successively translated thirteen volumes of the Russian edition of the "Complete Works of Stalin," eight volumes of the "Complete Works of Lenin," and three volumes of the "Complete Works of Marx and Engels." After the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, due to the great improvement of the cadres' class consciousness and work enthusiasm, coupled with the encouragement of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results and the nationwide Great Leap Forward, the Compilation and Translation Bureau translated all the thirty volumes of the Russian fourth edition of the "Complete Works of Lenin" that had not yet been translated in the one year from August 1958 to the end of July this year, and published them by the end of September, and the quality of the translation was guaranteed. This is an extraordinary leap forward in the translation and publication of Marxist-Leninist classics in our country. The Compilation and Translation Bureau is now planning that, in the future, in addition to translating and publishing the remaining volumes of the Russian fourth edition of the "Complete Works of Lenin" as soon as the Russian edition is published, it is also planned to translate and publish all the volumes of the Russian second edition of the "Complete Works of Marx and Engels" that have been published by the end of 1962 (all thirty-six volumes, twenty-eight volumes will be published by the end of 1962) in order to meet the urgent needs of the Party's theoretical work.

	Lenin taught us, "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement. ... Only a party guided by advanced theory can realize the role of advanced fighters." The power of theory lies in its ability to clarify the laws of social life, to discern the direction of the situation, to understand the internal connections of surrounding events, to predict the development of events, and to answer all the fundamental questions raised by the practice of revolutionary struggle and socialist construction. Only after the working masses, through their leaders—the Party—know the laws of historical development and the conditions for their class to achieve victory, can they become the true masters of life and history, can they become the true promoters, can they become the true workers of socialist society, and can they become the true masters of the new country and the new society. The entire history of our Party shows that the reason why it can realize the role of organizer and leader of our people's democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction, and can lead our people to win great victories step by step in all revolutionary struggles, is precisely because it is guided by the advanced theory of the workers' movement—Marxism-Leninism.

	The "Complete Works of Lenin" is a theoretical treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. Now, when the people of the whole country are fighting under the leadership of the Party to oppose right-leaning and encourage enthusiasm in order to defend the Party's general line, the complete Chinese translation of the 38 volumes of the Russian fourth edition of the "Complete Works of Lenin" has great political significance. Obviously, it will play a major role in the Party's theoretical work, in raising the political and theoretical level of the entire Party, and in raising the political consciousness of the broad masses of the people. It will become a powerful weapon for our people to strive to implement the Party's general line and build our country into a socialist power. Therefore, we should earnestly study Lenin's great theoretical legacy and strive to improve our own political and ideological level.

    学习列宁的理论遗产
    张仲实
    “列宁全集”俄文第四版已出前三十八卷，到今年9月底止，已经全部译成中文出版。这是中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局、人民出版社和新华印刷厂三方，经过一年的辛勤努力和密切协作，联合献给中华人民共和国成立十周年庆祝盛典的珍贵礼物。这也是我国在传播列宁著作方面的一个巨大成就。
    列宁是全世界无产阶级和全体进步人类的天才领袖，是马克思和恩格斯革命学说的伟大继承者，是帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义—列宁主义的创造者。他创造了世界上头一个新型的无产阶级政党——苏联共产党，他组织了伟大的社会主义革命，并缔造了世界上头一个社会主义国家——苏联。
    在无产阶级革命的思想武器中，列宁主义是把磨得最快的武器。列宁在他的著作中阐发了无产阶级斗争的一切基本问题，比如哲学、政治经济学、历史、理论、组织、党纲、战略和策略等，同各色各样的机会主义作了不可调和的斗争，保卫了马克思主义。列宁把马克思主义提高到一个新的更高的阶段，创造性地向前发展了它，用新的革命原理和革命经验充实了它，丰富了它。在创立新型的马克思主义政党、在争取无产阶级革命胜利和无产阶级专政、在建立世界上头一个苏维埃国家和社会主义社会、在鼓舞和发展被压迫民族解放运动等方面，列宁的著作更起了巨大的作用。列宁的著作是严格的和高度的科学性同革命性结合起来的典范。它对世界各国的社会主义者具有不可遏止的吸引力。所以，列宁的著作是全世界无产阶级和进步人类的珍贵财富。
    唯其如此，苏联人民和苏联共产党中央对列宁著作的传播十分重视。从十月社会主义革命胜利后，到1956年，“列宁全集”俄文版曾编印过四次。从1957年起，又在编印第五版。
    “列宁全集”俄文第一版是在1920年根据俄共第九次代表大会的决定，为纪念列宁五十寿辰而开始出版的，到1926年出齐。这是用文集形式出版列宁著作的头一个尝试。这一版共二十卷，编入的主要是已经发表的一些作品，共约一千五百篇，分二十六册。因有些卷太厚，分装成上下两册。1925年12月18日，斯大林在“向联共第十四次代表大会的政治报告”中，曾对“列宁全集”出版的意义作了很高的评价。他说：“我们幸运的就是，列宁的一些著作我们已经出过好多版了。现在人们都在阅读，都在学习并开始了解问题了。不仅党的领导者，而且普通党员都开始了解问题了，他们已经不再受人愚弄了。现在蜕化的叫嚣已经吓不倒任何人了。人们自己能够判别问题。不管有人怎样叫嚣，不管有人怎样用引证来吓唬人，但是普通党员听了以后是能够判别的，因为现在他们手里都有列宁的著作。这个事实就是我们党不会离开列宁主义道路的一个基本保证。”第一版“列宁全集”还没有把列宁在布尔什维克报纸上的好多论著和其他许多作品和书信都编进去；作品也不是按发表年月排列，有些是按专题编集的。
    因此，在列宁逝世（1924年1月）后不久，苏联第二届苏维埃代表大会（1924年1月底）和俄共第十三次代表大会（1924年5月下旬）为了纪念列宁，都先后决定，从1925年起，同时编印“列宁全集”第二、第三两版。苏联第二届苏维埃代表大会的决议中说道：“纪念列宁的最好的办法是广泛地传播他的著作，使共产主义思想成为一切劳动者的财产。”这两版内容相同，只是版型不同。全书到1932年出齐，共三十卷；其中前27卷为作品，第28、29卷为书信，最后一卷（30卷）为补遗。这两种版本的内容充实了一些，比第一版增加了一千二百六十五篇新的作品，其中约有五百封书信和大量曾经在布尔什维克的合法的和地下的刊物上发表过的未署名或用笔名的论文。但是，这两版也还没有将列宁的大量作品和书信全部编入；而且据苏共中央指出，某些卷的附录和评论中注释，还“犯了暗害性的最粗暴的政治错误。”（8见“联共中央关于因‘联共（布）历史简明教程’出版而应如何进行党的宣传工作的决议”）
    因此，1938年11月苏共中央决定重新编印“列宁全集”第四版。第四版共四十三卷，从1941年起刊行，仅出第一、二两卷，即因卫国战争爆发中止，但准备工作继续进行。战争结束后，从1946年起，恢复出版，到1958年年底，已出第1至38卷。这一版编入的作品共达二千九百二十七篇，增加了许多新的、为读者所不知道的文件，其中有五百零一篇文件是第一次收入全集。按内容说来，第1至33卷为专著、论文、讲演和报告；第34至35卷为书信和电报；36至43卷为补遗，其中第36卷为原已编入第二、第三两版，但未收进第四版的一些作品和初次发表的一些论文；第37卷为“给亲属的信”；第38卷为“哲学笔记”；第39卷为“帝国主义论笔记”；第40卷为“土地问题笔记”；第41卷—43卷为手稿、札记、短文和读书摘要等。后面这五卷尚未出版。
    为了便于阅读和钻研，这一版除有“第四版说明”（第一卷卷前）外，每卷卷首都有说明，卷末都附有注释和列宁在这个时期的生活和活动年表。“第四版说明”是扼要地阐明本版出版的意义和它同以前各版的区别，评述新增的著作，并说明作品的编排原则和参考资料的内容。各卷的“说明”，则是介绍编入本卷的是那一时期的著作，解释重要作品的内容，指明本版新添的作品。“注释”是注明某事件或人物的政治情况或引文的出处，有些放在书末，有些是脚注。“列宁的生活和活动年表”是记述重要事件，列宁的革命活动、某一作品的写作或第一次发表时间、列宁作讲演、报告、发言的日子、以及参加某一代表大会等等。这些材料是列宁传略的补充，在读者研究列宁的作品或传记时，都能从中得到帮助。
    第四版虽然有上述种种优点，但据潘克拉托娃在苏共第20次代表大会上的发言中说，第二、三两版和“列宁文集”所编选的某些文章和书信，没有编入第四版；列宁的一些重要笔记和其他某些作品，都遗漏了（后来第四版增出了补遗，弥补了这些缺点。）；此外，苏共中央主席团在1957年2月决定，从这一年起，又重新编印第五版，预定将以前各版已经编入或尚未收集的所有列宁的著作，包括专著、论文、讲演、报告、发言草稿和读书摘要等等，统统编入，分五十五卷。这个最新的版本到1959年7月仅出至第四卷，因此，目前流行的还是第四版。
    列宁的著作集，在各国也广泛地流传起来。除我国、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜和德意志民主共和国等社会主义国家外，意、法、葡萄牙、挪威、希腊、日本、阿根廷和巴西等国，也都在翻译“列宁全集”俄文第四版。
    列宁的著作像灯塔一样照耀着各国劳动人民的革命道路，也照耀着我国人民的革命道路。在我国革命发展的每一阶段上，列宁的思想，都经过毛泽东同志的马列主义的巧手，同我国的具体实践结合起来，武装了我党的广大干部，并教育了广大的人民群众，使革命获得一个又一个的胜利。因此，我党在各个时期，不论条件怎样，都对列宁著作的传播工作十分重视。
    毛泽东同志说，十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。在十月革命胜利后，列宁的著作就被我国当时的革命知识分子介绍过来。在1918和1919两年，我国刊物就开始介绍十月社会主义革命的意义和列宁的生平事略。到了1920年，一些革命的和进步的刊物，如“新青年”、“共产党人”和“曙光”等，都陆续刊载列宁的著作。当时介绍过来的有“在俄共第八次代表大会上关于党纲的报告”（一部分）、“在俄共第九次代表大会上的演说”、“无产阶级专政时期的经济和政治”和“从破坏历来的旧制度到创造新的制度”等报告和论文。篇数虽然不多，但是毫无疑问，列宁的这些著作对当时各地马克思主义小组的发展和中国共产党的成立起过不小的作用。
    在中国共产党成立的前夕，1921年6月间，李大钊同志在“俄罗斯革命的过去和现在”一文中扼要地叙述了列宁的生平和他的革命活动，并把列宁的重要著作（十九种）列举了一个目录。
    1921年7月党成立以后，对列宁著作的传播工作就更加重视了。党在上海成立了人民出版社，除出版了马克思和列宁的几种著作外，曾经准备翻译和出版“马克思全书”十五种、“列宁全书”十四种和“共产主义丛书”十一种等。由于帝国主义者（租界）和中国反动统治的摧残，这些计划没有全部实现，而人民出版社后来也遭到破坏查封。
    在第一次国内革命战争时期，随着革命的发展，列宁的著作大量地翻译过来。从1924到1927年这四年之内，列宁著作译成中文发表的已达二十三种。其中有关于中国革命问题、殖民地民族解放运动和无产阶级革命战略和策略问题的名作，如“落后的欧洲与先进的亚洲”、“更新的中国”、“亚洲的觉悟”、“中国的战争”等等及“帝国主义是资本主义的最高阶段”、“共产主义运动中的‘左’派幼稚病”和“国家与革命”等书的各一部分。
    在第二次国内革命战争时期，虽然革命根据地物质条件极端困难，国民党统治区白色恐怖又异常猖狂，但是党坚持不懈地克服了种种困难，扩大了马列主义经典著作的传播工作。这个时期翻译和出版的列宁专著或文集达三十八种。其中重要的有“论游击战争”、“帝国主义是资本主义的最后阶段”、“两个策略”、“国家与革命”、“无产阶级革命与叛徒考茨基”、“农民与革命”、“从二月革命到十月革命”、“三个国际”、“卡尔·马克思”、“重新审查工人党的土地纲领”（一部分）、“1905—1907年俄国革命中的农民问题与社会民主党的土地纲领”、“唯物论与经验批判论”、“俄国资本主义的发展”、“共产主义青年团的基本任务”、“列宁‘论托尔斯泰’”和“列宁家书集”等。这些著作有的是在江西中央红区出版的，有的是在国民党统治区出版的。
    抗日战争展开后，党中央十分重视马列主义理论的宣传工作。1938年10月党中央决定全党普遍深入地学习马列主义理论。1942年党又采取整风运动的形式，进行了一次深入的全党范围的马列主义教育，使全党干部和党员认识和克服党内的各种不良倾向，特别是主观主义、宗派主义及这两种倾向的表现形式——党八股。这次党的马列主义教育——整风运动大大地提高了党的政治思想水平，使党的领导机关和领导干部进一步地掌握了马列主义普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践相结合这样一个基本的方向。为了适应这种需要，在这个时期，列宁的著作就愈来愈多地介绍过来。据不完全的材料，从1937年7月到1945年7月，各抗日根据地和国民党统治区出版的列宁著作共达五十七种。党中央曾经在延安设立了“解放社”，负责有计划地出版马列主义经典著作。除出版列宁的专著和文选以外，“解放社”还出版了“列宁选集”二十卷。这是我国首次用文集形式出版列宁的著作。这里值得特别指出的是，这个时期党还出版了列宁有关战争问题的一些著作，如列宁“论游击战争”、“列宁读战争论的笔记”、“社会主义与战争”、“列宁论战争”和“列宁‘克劳塞维兹战争论’笔记”等。从这里可以看出，党对马列主义关于战争理论是如何的重视。
    在第三次国内革命战争时期，马列主义经典著作的传播工作更加扩大了。各解放区都出版了大量的经典著作译本。这个时期的四年内，出版的列宁著作共达六十六种。这个时期快结束时，1949年初，党中央为了提高党的政治理论水平、迎接人民革命在全国范围内的胜利，曾经规定马恩列斯的经典著作十种，作为“干部必读”，其中有列宁的著作：“帝国主义是资本主义的最高阶段”、“国家与革命”、“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”三书及“列宁斯大林论中国”一书。
    中华人民共和国的成立创造了大规模翻译和出版马列主义经典著作的有利条件。党中央和人民政府都十分重视干部的思想教育工作和在人民群众中普及政治教育的工作。国家出版机关——人民出版社成为出版马列主义经典著作的中心。这时列宁的著作更大量出版了。从1949年10月到1953年初这三年之内，印行的列宁著作共有七十二种。这时，人民出版社除出版“列宁文选”（两卷集）、“列宁文集”（六册）和列宁的许多专著以外，还出版了各种专题文集，如“论工会”、“论国家”、“论作家”、“论中国”和“论社会主义经济建设”等。
    1953年年初，党中央为了又快又好地翻译马列主义经典著作，特别设立了中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局。它的主要任务就是有计划有系统地翻译“马克思恩格斯全集”、“列宁全集”和“斯大林全集”。其中“列宁全集”就是依照党中央的决定，根据俄文第四版翻译的。这几年以来，编译局在党中央的领导下，在执行这个任务方面已获得了很大的成绩。从1953年初起到1958年6月止，曾经陆续译出了“斯大林全集”俄文本十三卷，“列宁全集”八卷和“马克思恩格斯全集”三卷。在整风反右斗争后，由于干部的阶级觉悟和工作积极性大大提高，再加上党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和全民大跃进的鼓舞，从1958年8月起到今年7月底止一年工夫，编译局便把“列宁全集”俄文第四版中尚未译出的三十卷全部翻译出来，到9月底出版问世，而译文质量还有保证。这是我国在马列主义经典著作翻译和出版工作方面的一个特大跃进。现在编译局正在规划，今后除将“列宁全集”俄文第四版所剩各卷一俟俄文版出版即尽速译出外，还预定到1962年年底，将“马克思恩格斯全集”俄文第二版已出各卷（全部三十六卷，到1962年底可出二十八卷）全部译出出版以适应党的理论工作的迫切需要。
    列宁教导我们，“没有革命的理论，也就不可能有革命的运动。……只有以先进理论为指导的党，才能实现先进战士的作用。”理论的力量就在于它使我们能弄清社会生活的规律、能辨明局势的方向、能懂得周围事件的内部联系、能预察事件的发展行程、能答复革命斗争和社会主义建设的实践所提出的一切根本问题。劳动群众只有经过自己的领导者——党知道了历史发展的规律和本阶级取得胜利的条件，才能成为生活和历史的真正主人，才能成为真正的促进派，才能成为社会主义社会的真正工作者，才能成为新国家、新社会的真正主人。我们党的全部历史表明，它所以能实现我国人民民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设的组织者和领导者的作用，能领导我国人民在一切革命斗争中节节获得伟大的胜利，正是因为它是以工人运动的先进理论——马克思列宁主义为指导的。
    “列宁全集”是马列主义的理论宝库。现在正当我国全国人民在党的领导下反右倾、鼓干劲，为保卫党的总路线而斗争的时候，“列宁全集”38卷，俄文第四版已出三十八卷的全部译成中文出版有很大的政治意义。显然，它在今后党的理论工作、在提高全党的政治理论水平和提高广大人民群众的政治觉悟方面，都将起重大的作用。它将成为我国人民为贯彻党的总路线，把我国建设成为一个社会主义强国而奋斗的强大武器。因此，我们应当认真学习列宁的伟大的理论遗产，为提高自己的政治思想水平而努力。
