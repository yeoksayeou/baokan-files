Combining Logging Production and Comprehensive Utilization
Greater Khingan Forest Industry Enters a New Stage

(By Our Correspondent) The forest industry in the Greater Khingan Mountains of Inner Mongolia has entered a new stage of combining timber logging production with comprehensive timber utilization. It is not only a timber production base for the motherland, but is also becoming a production base for various forest industrial products. From January to mid-November this year, the entire forest area produced more than 430 tons of forest industrial products such as activated carbon, tannin extract, rosin, fiberboard, birch bark oil, wood vinegar, and pine resin. A considerable portion of these has supported the chemical, pharmaceutical, and tanning industries in Beijing, Tianjin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, and other regions. In addition, from January 1 to November 26, more than 450,000 cubic meters of processed railway sleepers and sawn timber were produced, an increase of 68% compared to the total output of last year, supporting railway and capital construction in various regions.

In the first half of last year, the Greater Khingan forest was still a blank slate in terms of forest chemical industry and artificial board industry. At that time, after felling large trees, in addition to sawing large quantities of logs and processing some railway sleepers and timber for export, a large amount of small branches and treetops, as well as bark, strips, and sawdust left over from sawing, were treated as waste. As a result, the utilization rate of logs was only about 70%. If the discarded branches, treetops, bark, and other materials were added, the overall utilization rate of a tree would be even lower.

Last autumn, the Inner Mongolia Forest Area Work Conference of the Chinese Communist Party determined the policy of "combining large, medium, and small-scale operations, using both indigenous and foreign methods, prioritizing indigenous methods before foreign ones, starting small and growing large, starting with single products and then diversifying, and prioritizing popularization before improvement, to rapidly develop timber processing and forest chemical industry and improve the timber utilization rate as soon as possible." As a result, a vigorous upsurge in running forest industries was launched from forest towns to forest farms. More than 800 workers, family members, and people's commune members participated in this movement. They overcame the difficulties of lacking technical personnel and equipment. In just three months, small-scale indigenous forest industrial factories blossomed everywhere, with more than 180 appearing. These factories turned bark, strips, branches, and treetops into fiberboard, wood wool board, charcoal, wood tar, wood vinegar, sodium acetate, etc. They also extracted tannin extract from larch bark. Even sawdust, once comprehensively utilized, became worth a hundred times more, being made into activated carbon, artificial marble slabs, alcohol, and wood flour, which are valuable materials for chemical and construction purposes. Moreover, even pine needles and shrubs – the leaves of pine trees used for rosin – were extracted to produce aromatic oils. As a result, more than 20 kinds of forest industrial products were trial-produced and manufactured, opening a new page of diversified operations and comprehensive utilization for the development of forest resources.

Currently, the movement to run forest industries is developing from small indigenous groups to a combination of large, medium, and small-scale operations, using both foreign and indigenous methods. A large-scale modern forest industrial complex – the Yakeshi Forest Products Comprehensive Processing Plant – is nearing completion. Its lumbering industry section has already been put into production. The tannin extract industry section, designed by the German Democratic Republic and supplied with a complete set of modern equipment, will be put into production next year. After that, it will be able to extract 5,000 tons of tannin extract from larch bark every year.

Producing artificial boards such as fiberboard and wood wool board is currently the main way to implement the policy of comprehensive utilization and improve timber utilization rate. Therefore, a small mechanized fiberboard factory has recently been put into production. Seven medium and small mechanized fiberboard factories are under construction at an accelerated pace.

Eight years ago, in this vast forest, there was only timber logging production, without even lumber processing. However, now lumber mills have been established in more than 20 large log storage yards. In eight years, nearly one million railway sleepers have been sawn, enough to lay more than 670 kilometers of railway. In addition, 500,000 cubic meters of timber have been sawn, supporting the construction of industrial bases in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Baotou, Anshan, and other places.

In addition, a forestry machinery manufacturing plant here has been put into production. It has now produced more than 40 chippers, crushers, pulpers, and other machines used to manufacture fiberboard, and 15 sets of circular saws for lumbering, to equip the newly built fiberboard factories and lumber mills.

### 采伐生产和综合利用结合  大兴安岭森林工业走上新阶段

    采伐生产和综合利用结合
    大兴安岭森林工业走上新阶段
    本报讯　内蒙古大兴安岭的森林工业已经走上了木材采伐生产和木材综合利用相结合的新阶段。它不仅是祖国的木材生产基地，同时正在成为各种林产工业品的生产基地。今年1月到11月中旬，全林区生产出的活性炭、栲胶、松香、纤维板、桦树皮油、醋石、松胶等林产工业品达四百三十多吨。其中相当一部分已支援了北京、天津、辽宁、内蒙古等地的化工、制药和制革等工业。此外，1月到11月26日止，加工的枕木、板枋材扎四十五万多立方米，比去年全年产量还多68％，支援了各地的铁路和基本建设。去年上半年大兴安岭林海里在林产化学工业和人造板工业方面还是一张白纸。那时，伐倒大树以后，除了锯成大批原木和加工一些枕木、板材输出外，还有大量杓桠梢头木，以及锯材剩下的板皮、板条、锯末等，被当成废品处理了。这样，原木的利用率仅有70％左右。如加上丢弃的枝桠、梢头、树皮等东西，一棵树的整个利用率就更低了。去年秋天，中共内蒙古林区工作会议上确定了“大中小相结合、土洋并举、先土后洋、由小到大、先单一后综合、先普及后提高，迅速发展木材加工和林产化学工业，尽快地提高木材利用率”的方针。于是，从林业城镇到林场，轰轰烈烈地掀起了大办林产工业的热潮。职工、家属、人民公社社员八百多人参加了这一运动。他们克服了技术力量和设备缺乏的困难。在短短三个月期间，就使小型土法林产工业工厂遍地开花，出现了一百八十多个。这些工厂把板皮、板条、树枝、梢头木等变成了纤维板、木丝板、木炭、木焦油、木醋石、醋酸纳等，还从落叶松树皮里提炼出了栲胶；锯末也一经综合利用就身价百倍，被制成了活性炭、人造理石板、酒精和木粉等化工和建筑方面的可贵材料；而且，连松针和灌木——松香的叶子也被提炼出了芳香油。结果，共试制和生产出了二十多种林产工业品，为开发森林资源揭开了多种经营和综合利用的新的一页。
    目前，大办林产工业的运动正在小土群基础上，向大中小相结合、洋土并举的方向发展。一座规模很大的现代化林产工业联合企业——牙克石林产综合加工厂快要建成了。它的制材工业部分已投入生产；由德意志民主共和国设计，并供应全套现代化设备的栲胶工业部分明年投入生产以后，每年可以从落叶松皮里提炼出五千吨栲胶。
    生产纤维板、木丝板等人造板是目前贯彻综合利用方针、提高木材利用率的主要途径，因此，一座小型机械化纤维板厂已在最近投入生产。七个中、小型机械化纤维板厂正在加速建设。
    八年前，在这广阔的林海里，只有采伐木材的生产，连锯材加工也没有。可是，现在在二十多个大型的贮木场上都建立起了制材厂。八年间锯出的枕木近一百万根，可铺设六百七十多公里铁路；还锯出了五十万立方米板材，支援了北京、天津、沈阳、包头、鞍山等工业基地的建设。
    此外，这里的一座林业机械制造厂已经投入了生产。它现在生产出了切片机、粉碎机、打浆机等制造纤维板用的机器四十多台，和制材用的圆锯机十五套，用以装备新建的纤维板厂和制材厂。
