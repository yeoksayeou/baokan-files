Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 3rd - The advanced collective attending the National "Heroes Conference," the steering gear housing team of the chassis workshop of the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory, has been exceeding all production tasks month after month, ten-day period after ten-day period, day after day, and shift after shift for twelve consecutive months since achieving a production level of 250 vehicle sets per shift in October 1958. In October of this year, they completed the production task of 1,900 vehicle sets of automobile parts in sixteen working days, and achieved zero defective products, zero equipment accidents, and zero tool damage, realizing the plan to present a gift to the National "Heroes Conference."
    The steering gear housing team is an advanced team that emerged during the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and was selected as a model for Jilin Province, Changchun City, and Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory. This team is known for boldly innovating technology, modifying product designs, and being the first in the factory to advocate "250 vehicles per shift." The original design capacity of the Changchun Automobile Factory was 50 vehicles per shift. Last year, the factory proposed a long-term plan to expand production capacity to 250 vehicles per shift by 1962. Encouraged by this grand plan, the workers of the steering gear housing team, after repeated research and heated debates, boldly proposed a plan to improve product design, simplify and adjust processes, improve equipment, and achieve 250 vehicle sets per shift. After many experiments, they changed the design of parts such as the steering gear housing and steering arm shaft, eliminating three kinds of parts, which not only saved four machine tools but also saved 4,500 tons of steel per year. They also simplified the processing of the steering arm shaft, reducing the original four processes to two, shortening the production cycle from four days to one day, and saving working space. They replaced a threading machine worth 5,000 yuan with a thread milling machine worth 20,000 yuan, increasing the processing capacity of the threading process by more than three times compared to the original; they also replaced a jig boring machine with a vertical drilling machine, achieving the effect of small investment and high return. Through boldly innovating technology and modifying product design, this team finally reached or exceeded the capacity of producing 250 vehicle sets of automobile parts per shift from the original 50 vehicle sets per shift, and also saved the country three machine tools, fifty square meters of operating area, and three workers. The Party Committee of the Changchun Automobile Factory attached great importance to this initiative of the steering gear housing team and launched a mass movement of "250 vehicles per shift, one factory becomes five factories" throughout the factory. Currently, three workshops and about a quarter of the teams in the factory have reached or exceeded the production level of 250 vehicle sets of automobile parts or installation tasks per shift.
    The steering gear housing team is responsible for processing three products: steering gear housings, steering arm shafts, and steering side covers, and has eighteen machine tools. Most of the eighteen workers in the team are first-level workers and apprentices. Under the inspiration of the General Line, they have continuously innovated technology, which has continuously improved production. Since the beginning of this year, the team has achieved more than thirty technical innovations, not only completing and over fulfilling various production tasks ahead of schedule, but also enabling three machine tools to reach or exceed the production level of 300 vehicle sets per shift, and ten machine tools to approach the production level of 300 vehicle sets per shift.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 3rd - The Chaling County Limin Iron Plant, one of the advanced collectives in Hunan Province attending the National Heroes Conference, had already exceeded its annual iron production task by the end of October. On the basis of this victory, all the factory workers have revised the production increase plan and further set off a new upsurge of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced" and preparing for the Great Leap Forward next year.
    Adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, vigorously carrying out mass movements, vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution, and strengthening enterprise management are the fundamental keys to the plant's early completion of its annual plan. In particular, since the great battle of August and September, inspired by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all the factory workers have greatly boosted their energy, and production has risen sharply. The average daily output in September reached 110 tons, an increase of 62.3% compared to August and 80.3% compared to July; from October 1st to 25th, the average daily output of the entire factory was further increased to 174.44 tons, the average utilization coefficient of the blast furnace reached 1.4, and the qualified rate of pig iron reached 98.75%.
    Entering October, the factory's Party committee mobilized the masses to summarize the experiences of the great battle in August and September, launched a competition to check the drive, check the depth of leadership, compare the early completion of tasks, compare the national advanced level, and compare the collaboration, seized typical comparisons, and vigorously helped the backward catch up with the advanced. For example, No. 3 furnace and No. 2 furnace have the same volume and the same number of workers, and No. 3 furnace's blower is driven by electricity, which is better than No. 2 furnace's steam engine, but production cannot catch up with No. 2 furnace. Based on this situation, the Party committee quickly organized the workers of No. 3 furnace to launch a discussion, fully boosted their morale, and specifically helped implement measures such as increasing the batch of materials, increasing the coke load, and rationally and evenly distributing materials, so that this blast furnace quickly caught up with the advanced level and promoted the increase in the daily output of the entire factory.
    The factory's leading cadres often go deep into the forefront of production to help solve key production problems, which is also an important factor in promoting the early completion of the annual production task. All seven members of the factory's Party committee went deep into the workshops, leading production in production, and organized the masses to break through wherever there were key problems. The leading cadres of each workshop also adopted the method of contracting to the furnace, achieving the goal of eating, living, and working with the workers.

    先进集体保持先进荣誉
    汽车厂转向器壳小组实现献礼计划
    茶陵利民铁厂超额完成全年产铁任务
    新华社长春3日电　出席全国“群英会”的先进集体、长春第一汽车厂底盘车间转向器壳小组，从1958年10月实现班产二百五十辆份的生产水平以来，一连在十二个月中，月月、旬旬、日日、班班超额完成各项生产任务。今年10月份他们用十六个工作日完成了全月一千九百辆份汽车零件的生产任务，并且做到了无废品、无设备事故、无刀具损坏，实现了向全国“群英会”献礼的计划。
    转向器壳小组是在1958年大跃进中出现的先进小组，曾经被选为吉林省、长春市和长春第一汽车厂的标兵。这个小组是以大胆革新技术、修改产品设计，在全厂首倡“班产二百五十辆”汽车而著称的。长春汽车厂原来设计能力是班产五十辆汽车，去年工厂提出了到1962年使生产能力扩大到班产二百五十辆汽车的远景规划。在这个雄伟的规划鼓舞下，转向器壳小组的工人经过反复研究和热烈辩论以后，大胆地提出了改进产品设计、简化和调整工序，改进设备，实现班产二百五十辆份的方案。经过多次试验，他们改变了转向器壳、转向臂轴等零件的设计，取消了三种零件，不但节省了四台机床，而且每年还可节省四千五百吨钢材。他们还简化了转向臂轴的加工工序，将原来四道并为两道，使过去生产周期由四天缩短为一天，并且节省了工作面积。他们用价值五千元的小套丝机代替价值两万元的螺纹铣床，螺纹工序加工能力比原来提高了三倍以上；用立式钻床代替金钢镗床，也达到投资小、收效大的效果。通过大胆革新技术，修改产品设计，这个小组终于由原来的班产五十辆份，全部达到或超过了班产二百五十辆份汽车零件的能力，还为国家节省了三台机床，五十平方米的作业面积和三名工人。长春汽车厂党委对转向器壳小组这一创举给予了极大的重视，在全厂展开“班产二百五十辆，一厂变五厂”的群众运动。现在已有三个车间和占全厂四分之一左右的小组达到或超过了班产二百五十辆汽车零件或安装任务的生产水平。
    转向器壳小组负责加工转向器壳、转向臂轴和转向侧盖三种产品，有十八台机床。全组十八名工人中，大部分是一级工和徒工。他们在总路线鼓舞下，不断革新技术，使生产不断提高。今年以来，这个小组又实现了三十多项技术革新，不仅提前和超额完成了各项生产任务，而且使三台机床已经达到或超过了班产三百辆份，十台机床接近了班产三百辆份的生产水平。
    新华社长沙3日电　湖南省出席全国群英会的先进集体之一——茶陵县利民铁厂，在10月底已经超额完成了全年的产铁任务。在这一胜利的基础上，全厂职工又重新修订了增产计划，进一步掀起了“比先进、学先进、赶先进”的竞赛和为明年大跃进作好准备的新高潮。
    坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新和技术革命，加强企业管理，是这个厂提前完成全年计划的根本关键。特别是大战8、9月以来，全厂职工在党的八届八中全会决议鼓舞下，大鼓干劲，生产直线上升。9月份平均日产达到一百一十吨，比8月份增长62.3％，比7月份增长80.3％；10月1日到25日，全厂平均日产又进一步提高到一百七十四点四四吨，高炉平均利用系数达一点四，生铁合格率达98.75％。
    进入10月份，厂党委就发动群众，总结大战8、9月份的经验，开展查干劲、查领导深入，比提前完成任务、比全国先进水平、比协作的竞赛，抓住典型对比，大力帮帮后进赶上先进。如三号炉和二号炉的容积都同样大，职工人数也相等，而且三号炉鼓风机还是电力带动，比二号炉用蒸汽机带动要好，然而生产却赶不上二号炉。党委根据这一情况，迅速组织三号炉的工人展开讨论，把干劲鼓足，并且具体帮助贯彻了增加料批、增加焦炭负荷、合理均匀布料等措施，从而使这座高炉很快赶上了先进水平，促进了全厂日产量的上升。
    厂的领导干部经常深入生产第一线帮助解决生产关键问题，也是促进全年生产任务提前完成的重要因素。厂党委七个委员都深入到车间，在生产中领导生产，哪里有关键问题，就到哪里组织群众突破。各车间的领导干部也都采取包干到炉的办法，做到了跟工人同吃同住同劳动。
