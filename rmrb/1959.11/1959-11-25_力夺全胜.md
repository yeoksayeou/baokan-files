    Strive for Complete Victory
    Lí Fū
    Based on the all-around red banner performance of the Benxi Iron and Steel Company in October, steel production continued to rise comprehensively after entering November. The average daily output of pig iron, steel, and steel products not only exceeded the first and middle ten days of October but also exceeded the last ten days of October. This situation of increasing production from one ten-day period to the next makes us even more convinced that continuous increase in production is entirely possible. In such heroic enterprises, it is worth looking forward to the earlier and greater surpassing of the national plan.
    The current situation on the industrial front is very good, but the work is not easy. At present, the most urgent task is to ensure the comprehensive, early, and over-fulfillment of this year's national plan in these short thirty-plus days. Judging from the current situation, in general, we are able to strive to complete the plan ahead of schedule, but how many days ahead? How much will we exceed? Can every enterprise complete ahead of schedule and exceed the target? It is impossible to draw a conclusion now. If, in these last thirty-odd days, every enterprise continues to exert its efforts without slackening, and completes the task in one go, then we can obtain the full fruits of victory earlier and create more material wealth for the country. If some enterprises are complacent, slack off, and "wait for the hare to come to the tree stump," then our harvest will be reduced.
    Athletes exert all their strength in the race nearing the finish line, without taking a break, and rush towards the final victory. We must also have this kind of spirit on the production front. We must know that completing the plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target is still only a possibility. To turn it into reality, it is not possible to run and stop, and it is even more impossible to stop and not run. Moreover, our goal is not just to achieve the original purpose. We also want to create higher records, earlier than earlier, and more than more.
    Such ambition is incompatible with slackening. Of course, we have not yet found such "epidemics" as slackening, but prevention is better than cure. Reminding everyone to prevent in time is only beneficial and not harmful.
    The bells of 1960 will soon ring. The closer 1959 is to the overall victory of the year, the more precious time becomes. Let us seize these last thirty-odd days, fully utilize every day, every hour, and every minute, advance the time for completing the plan again and again, and strive for more and better steel, coal, ore, machines, petroleum..., transport more goods, and accumulate more funds, to greet the continued leap forward in 1960 with more abundant gifts.

    力夺全胜

    本溪钢铁公司在10月份满堂红的基础上，进入11月份以后，钢铁生产仍然继续全面上升，生铁、钢、钢材的平均日产量不仅超过10月上旬、中旬，而且超过10月下旬。这种一旬高一旬，生产逐旬增长的状况，使我们更加确信：生产不断地上升，是完全可以做到的；在这样的英雄企业里，国家计划完成得更早，超过得更多，可以拭目以待。
    当前工业战线的形势很好，但工作并不轻松。现在，最迫切的任务是要在这短促的三十多天里，保证全面、提前、超额地完成今年的国家计划。从目前情况来看，在总的方面，我们是能够争取提前完成计划的，但是提前多少天？超过多少？是不是每个企业都能够提前，都能够超过？现在还不能作结论。如果在这最后的三十几天里，每一个企业都再接再厉不松劲，一鼓作气干到底，那么，我们就可以更早地把全部胜利果实拿到手，更多地为国家创造物质财富。如果有些企业自满、松劲，“守株待兔”，那么，我们的收获就会减少。
    运动员们在赛跑临近终点的时候，拿出全副的力量，一口气也不歇，向着最后的胜利猛冲。我们在生产战线上也要有这种劲头。须知，提前、超额完成计划，现在还只是可能性，要把它变成现实，跑跑停停不行，停下来不跑更不行。何况，我们的目标并不只是达到原来的目的而已，我们还要创造更高的纪录，提前了还要更早，超额了还要更多呢。
    这样的志气，同松劲情绪是不能相容的。当然，现在我们还没有发现松劲这一类“流行病”，但是预防胜于治疗，及时提醒大家预防，只有好处，没有坏处。
    1960年的钟声不久就要鸣响。1959年距离全年的胜利愈近，时间就愈宝贵。让我们抓紧这最后的三十几天，充分运用每一天、每一小时、每一分钟，把完成计划的时间提前再提前，力争超额更多更好的钢铁、煤炭、矿石、机器、石油……，运送更多的货物，积累更多的资金，用更丰盛的礼物来迎接继续跃进的1960年。
