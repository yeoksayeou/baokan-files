Xinhua News Agency, November 18th -- According to reports from the Indian Information Service: Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech on the Sino-Indian border issue on November 16th at the opening of the winter session of the People's Chamber (Lower House).

In his speech, Nehru addressed Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to him dated November 7th. He said, "Premier Zhou Enlai put forward several temporary proposals aimed at eliminating the possibility of any future border conflicts. We agree that it is highly desirable to take the necessary steps to avoid any border conflicts, followed by attempts to seek a peaceful settlement of the disputes related to the border. However, the proposals put forward by Premier Zhou Enlai in his published letter appear to us to be impractical. Therefore, we have put forward some other proposals that seem practical to us and can end the danger of border conflicts."

He said: "Premier Zhou Enlai also suggested in his letter that the prime ministers of the two countries hold talks in the near future to discuss the border issue and other outstanding issues between the two countries. I have always expressed my willingness to discuss any disputed issues. However, if such a meeting is to produce results—and we hope that it will—we should first concentrate our current efforts on reaching a temporary understanding as suggested. In addition, some preparatory steps are necessary to lay the foundation for our discussions. It should be remembered that there is a large amount of historical data, maps, etc., regarding the border issue."

Nehru also said in his speech that his reply to Premier Zhou Enlai had been delivered to the Chinese Ambassador to India that day, and he was prepared to publish it and submit it to Parliament along with other documents after Premier Zhou Enlai received the letter. He suggested that Parliament use these documents for a special debate on November 25th. Parliament agreed to this suggestion.

Nehru mentioned in his speech that "on November 14th, the Chinese authorities handed over to our police officers the ten prisoners they had captured and the nine bodies of our soldiers. A constable named Mahan Lal has still not been accounted for, and we must assume that he is also dead." He also said that the Chinese government obtained confessions from the captured Indian police, "which means that they must have been interrogated." He said, "Needless to say, the practice of interrogating such prisoners is very regrettable."

Nehru also announced, "Following the Longju incident, it has been decided to place the entire Indian border under the direct responsibility of the Indian army. Further steps have been taken for this purpose." In response to a question from a member of parliament as to whether this included the borders of Sikkim and Bhutan, Nehru said: "As for Bhutan, we have repeatedly stated that any aggression against Bhutan will be considered an aggression against India, but we have no troops in Bhutan and have no intention of sending any troops there. It is up to the Bhutanese government to decide when they require our help and assistance. As for Sikkim, it is certainly included in our direct obligation to protect its borders."

Since the Kongka Pass incident, Nehru has given eight speeches at public rallies and press conferences held across India on the incident and Sino-Indian relations.

In his speeches, Nehru described this incident of Indian armed personnel invading Chinese territory as an "intolerable" and "unprovoked attack" by the Chinese on an Indian patrol in Ladakh, and as an "attempt to seize this land by force." He said that the place where the incident occurred was "part of Indian Ladakh, not part of China," and said, "This is unusual because the Chinese used mortars and grenades." (October 25th in Meerut)

In his speeches, Nehru attacked China for practicing "expansionism" and being "belligerent" and opposed to moving towards peace. He said that China's activities on the Indian border "are related to China's expansionism, which may be related to something, but it is essentially a factor that China has shown many times in its past two thousand years; it is not the first time they have done this." (November 5th at a press conference in New Delhi) He said that after the recent border conflict incident, the relationship between the two countries began a "new chapter." He said, "Behind this, there may be other things happening in China, and there may be a kind of arrogance that the Chinese have developed due to their increasing strength." He also said, "It is not a good thing for China to flaunt its strength in such a rough way. This is not the way powerful countries act. Moreover, China's misconduct has damaged the atmosphere of the world; world leaders are trying to end the Cold War in this atmosphere and resolve their problems through peaceful methods." He said, "Except for China, the whole world is striving for peace." (November 1st at a mass rally in New Delhi) He also said something like, "China may have a sense of being at war and belligerent." (November 5th press conference)

In his speeches, Nehru repeatedly stated that he would respond to the so-called Chinese "challenge" to India with a firm attitude, determination, and strength. He said that the Sino-Indian border issue is a "big problem." He said that this problem may become even bigger in the future. He said: "I cannot say what form it will take in the future, but the scale of this challenge may develop. Therefore, we must not only deal with this challenge in its current aspect, but also be prepared to deal with it tomorrow or the day after tomorrow." "We will definitely deal with this challenge with all our strength." He also said, "If China is a big country, India is also a big country. We are strong enough to deal with any challenge." (November 1st in New Delhi)

Nehru also mentioned when answering questions at a press conference on November 5th that the Sino-Indian border issue would be discussed in the talks during Eisenhower's visit to India.

Nehru praised the anti-China rhetoric spread by some Indian newspapers. He said that many things have been published in the newspapers about the border issue between India and China. This has powerfully influenced people's thoughts and emotions. This is completely correct and appropriate. It is also correct for newspapers to reflect the people's anger at China's attack on the Indian border. (November 1st at a mass rally in New Delhi) He also said at a mass rally in Indore on November 12th, "You can work hard within the scope of your own duties to better express your indignation at China's attack on our border." He said, "You must remember that the army needs modern weapons to fight the enemy and defend the borders of the motherland. So we must exert our greatest strength to industrialize the country and improve agriculture through planned work, so that the Five-Year Plan can be successful."

In his speeches, Nehru also stated that regarding the Sino-Indian border issue, "We hope that it can be resolved peacefully; but even if this problem is to be resolved peacefully, we must be strong and not bow our heads." (November 10th at a rally in Agra) He also said that India's general attitude "has always been to meet, always to discuss, to avoid strong language, but always to be prepared—as long as people can be prepared—to take strong action, first of all to avoid excitement and fear." (November 5th at a press conference in New Delhi)

In several speeches, Nehru rejected demands that India abandon its non-alignment policy to deal with China. He said, "The whole idea of ​​India abandoning its non-alignment policy comes from those who are hot-headed but cowardly. We must calmly and boldly face all kinds of challenges." He also said that some political parties in India have obviously put forward this slogan of abandoning non-alignment for the sake of party interests, and these parties hope to use this situation to strengthen themselves. (November 1st in New Delhi) He said, "Our policy has always been that we will not form military alliances with any group, and we will be self-reliant. We have declared that, on the one hand, we will strengthen our strength, and on the other hand, we will try to maintain friendly relations with all countries. Some neighboring countries have formed military alliances with other countries and demanded military assistance. It can be said that these countries (seeking military alliances) have already lost their independence to some extent to others and are not self-reliant." (November 11th at a rally in Dewas)

In his speeches, Nehru also attacked the Communist Party of India. He said, "The roots and ideas of this party are outside India, and it seeks the opinions of others." He said, "I do not want such a party to play a major role in Indian affairs." (November 11th at a rally in Ujjain)

    尼赫鲁就中印边界问题发表讲话
    同意采取必要步骤避免边境冲突并和平解决争端
    但又说我建议不切实际总理会谈也需先有临时谅解
    新华社18日讯　据印度新闻处报道：印度总理尼赫鲁16日在当天开幕的人民院（下院）冬季会议上就中印边界问题发表了讲话。
    尼赫鲁在讲话中谈到周恩来总理在11月7日写给他的信。他说，“周恩来总理提出了若干目的在于消除今后发生任何边境冲突的可能性的临时建议。我们同意：采取必要的步骤来避免任何边境冲突，随后并继之以谋求和平解决同边境有关的争端的尝试，是十分可取的。但是周恩来总理在他那封已经公布的信中所提出的建议，在我们看来是不切实际的。因此我们另外提出了一些建议，这些建议在我们看来是切合实际的，是能结束发生边境冲突的危险的。”
    他说：“周恩来总理在他的信中还建议，两国总理在不久将来举行会谈来讨论边界问题和两国之间其他悬而未决的问题。我一向表示愿意讨论任何有争执的问题。但是，如果要这种会晤产生结果的话，——我们希望这种会晤能产生结果——我们首先应该把当前的努力集中在像所建议的那样取得临时谅解上。此外，为了给我们的讨论奠定基础，采取一些准备步骤是必要的。应当记住，关于边境问题，有着一大堆历史资料、地图、等等。”
    尼赫鲁在讲话中还说，他给周恩来总理的复信已经在当天交给中国驻印度大使，他准备在周恩来总理收到这封信以后把它公布和同其它文件一起提交议会，他建议议会利用这些文件在11月25日进行专门的辩论。议会同意了这个建议。
    尼赫鲁在讲话中提到，“在11月14日，中国当局向我们的警官移交了他们俘获的十名俘虏和我们战士的九具尸体。一个名叫马汉·拉尔的巡警仍然没有交待，我们必须认为，他也已经死了。”他还说，中国政府从被俘的印度警察那里获得了供词，“这意味着，他们一定受过审讯”。他说，“不用说，审讯这类俘虏的做法是非常令人遗憾的。”
    尼赫鲁还宣布，“在朗久事件以后已经决定把印度的全部边境交由印度军队直接负责。为此已经进一步采取了步骤”。在答复议员提出的这是否包括锡金和不丹的边境在内的问题时，尼赫鲁说：“至于不丹，我们已再三说过，对不丹的任何侵略将被认为是对印度的侵略，但是我们在不丹没有部队，也没有派任何部队去的打算。他们要求我们在什么时候帮助和给予援助，要由不丹政府来决定。就锡金而论，它肯定包括在我们保护边界的直接义务中。”
    自从空喀山口事件发生以来，尼赫鲁曾经就这一事件和中印关系问题在印度各地举行的公众集会和记者招待会上发表过八次讲话。
    尼赫鲁在讲话中把这次印度武装人员侵犯中国领土的事件说成是中国人在拉达克对印度的巡逻队进行的“不能容忍的”“无端的袭击”，是“试图用武力占领这块土地”。他说，发生这次事件的地方是“印度的拉达克的一部分，不是中国的一部分”，他说：“这是不寻常的事情，因为中国人使用了迫击炮和手榴弹。”（10月25日在密拉特）
    尼赫鲁在讲话中攻击中国实行“扩张主义”，“好战”，反对走向和平。他说，中国在印度边界的活动“是同中国的扩张主义有关系的，这种扩张主义可能同某种事情有关，但是它本质上是中国在它过去两千年的历史中多次表现的一个因素，他们不是第一次这样做。”（11月5日在新德里举行的记者招待会上）他说，在最近的边界冲突事件发生以后，两国的关系开始了“新的一章”。他说，“在这背后可能还有中国所发生的其他事情，有中国人出于自己日益增强的力量而产生的一种骄傲自大。”他又说，“中国以这样粗暴的方式来炫耀它的力量不是件好事情。这不是强大的国家行事的方式。而且，中国的不良行为已经损害了世界的气氛；世界领袖们正在这种气氛中设法结束冷战，通过和平的方法解决他们的问题。”他说，“除中国以外，全世界都在努力走向和平。”（11月1日在新德里的群众集会上）他还说甚么，“中国可能有处于交战状态和好战之感”。（11月5日记者招待会）
    尼赫鲁在讲话中一再表示要以坚定的态度、决心和力量来应付所谓中国对印度的“挑战”。他说中印边界问题是一个“大问题”。他说这个问题将来有可能变得更大。他说：“我说不上它在将来会采取什么形式，但是这个挑战的规模可能发展。因此，我们必须不仅是在这个挑战的目前方面对付这个挑战，而且还准备在明天或后天来对付它”。“我们一定会以全部力量对付这个挑战”。他还说，“如果说中国是一个大国，印度也是一个大国。我们强大得足以对付任何挑战。”（11月1日在新德里）
    尼赫鲁11月5日在记者招待会上回答问题时也谈到，在艾森豪威尔访问印度时，将在会谈中谈及中印边界问题。
    尼赫鲁称赞印度一些报纸散播的攻击中国的言论。他说，报上发表了许多关于印度和中国之间的边界问题的东西。这有力地影响了人民的思想和情绪。这是完全正确和适当的。报纸反映人民对中国袭击印度边境一事的这种愤怒，这也是正确的。（11月1日在新德里群众集会上）他11月12日还在印多尔的群众集会上说，“你们可以在你们自己的职务范围内努力工作，来更好地表现你们对中国袭击我们边界的愤慨。”他说，“你们必须记住，军队需要现代武器来同敌人作战和保卫祖国的边界。所以我们必须发挥我们最大的力量通过计划工作来使国家工业化和改进农业，使五年计划得到成功。”
    尼赫鲁在讲话中也表示，关于中印边界问题，“我们希望它能够和平地得到解决；但是，即使这个问题要和平地加以解决，我们也必须坚强有力，不应该低头。”（11月10日在亚格拉的集会上）他又说，印度总的态度“始终是会晤，始终是进行讨论，避免强烈的语言，但是始终准备——只要人们能够准备——采取强硬的行动，首先要避免激动和害怕。”（11月5日在新德里记者招待会上）
    尼赫鲁在几次讲话中拒绝了印度放弃不结盟政策来对付中国的要求。他说，“关于印度放弃它的不结盟政策的整个说法是来自那些头脑发热但是却很胆小的那些人。我们必须冷静而大胆地正视各种挑战”。他还说，印度的某些政党显然是为了党派的利益提出了这个放弃不结盟的口号，这些党派希望利用这个局势来加强它们自己。（11月1日在新德里）他说，“我们的政策一直是，我们将不同任何集团缔结军事联盟，我们将自立。我们已经宣布，我们一方面增强我们的力量，一方面将设法同一切国家保持友好关系。某些邻国同其他国家缔结了军事联盟，并且要求军事援助。可以说，这些（寻求军事联盟的）国家已经在某种程度上把它们的独立丧失给其他人而并不自立。”（11月11日在德瓦斯的集会上）
    尼赫鲁在讲话中还攻击了印度共产党。他说，“这个党的根子和思想在印度以外，它寻求其他人的意见。”他说，“我不希望这样一个党在印度的事务中起重大作用。”（11月11日在乌贾因的集会上）
