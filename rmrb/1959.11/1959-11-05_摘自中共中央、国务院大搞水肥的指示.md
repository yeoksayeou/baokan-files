All localities should, based on the fertilizer requirements of next year's increased production plan, formulate plans for accumulating and producing fertilizer, mobilize the masses, and quickly launch a campaign to accumulate and produce fertilizer. The main source of farm fertilizer is to greatly develop pig raising, and further launch a pig-raising upsurge in winter. At the same time, actively develop the utilization of other fertilizer sources. All localities should also actively adopt small indigenous groups and small foreign groups methods to develop chemical fertilizer production and increase the quantity of chemical fertilizers according to local specific conditions. The South should make full use of the winter fallow fields to expand the green manure planting area, strengthen the field management of green manure, and increase the green manure yield.

    各地应该根据明年增产计划对肥料的要求，制订积肥、造肥计划，发动群众，迅速掀起积肥、造肥运动。农家肥料的主要来源是大量发展养猪，在冬季进一步掀起养猪高潮。同时，对其他肥源也要积极开展利用。各地还要根据当地的具体条件，积极采取小土群和小洋群的方法发展化肥生产，增加化肥数量。南方要尽量利用冬闲田扩大绿肥种植面积，加强绿肥的田间管理，提高绿肥产量。
