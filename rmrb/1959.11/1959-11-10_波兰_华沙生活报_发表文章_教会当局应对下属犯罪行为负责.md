The Polish newspaper "Warsaw Life" published an article on November 3rd entitled "Who Is This Serving and Why?" criticizing the church authorities. The article stated that due to the rumors widely circulating in Warsaw about "strange events," every evening people gather on Nowolipki Street to see the copper top of St. Augustine's Church tower glowing or phosphorescing in the twilight and in good weather. This situation makes the residents of the area uneasy and also makes all ordinary, rational citizens indignant. Almost every day, residents write letters, make phone calls, or come directly to the editorial office of "Warsaw Life" to ask when they can get some peace and quiet? When will this wave of hysteria and superstition end?

The article said that the church authorities saw all of this. Only a few weeks ago, they issued an appeal to the parishioners saying that the glowing copper sheets on the church tower were a normal phenomenon and that they should not gather in large numbers around the church. However, this appeal did not produce any effect. After that, the church adopted a very indifferent, hands-off attitude, maintaining a meaningful silence. Moreover, many Catholic monks, seminary students, friars, and nuns can be seen in the crowds on Nowolipki Street every day, and these people are very active in the crowd, doing something ambiguous.

The article went on to say that it is inconceivable that the church authorities cannot stop their subordinates from committing crimes. We believe, and are even convinced, that church leaders have the appropriate means to make the monks obey. The church authorities must be held responsible for the Catholic monks and friars not obeying the church authorities.

The article concluded by saying that the wave of hysteria and sensationalism is settling down. We believe that reason and civic responsibility will triumph over superstition and will effectively oppose foolishness and evil schemes. And the church authorities responsible for this will remember their responsibilities.

    波兰“华沙生活报”发表文章
    教会当局应对下属犯罪行为负责
    本报讯　波兰“华沙生活报”于11月3日发表了一篇题为“这是为谁和为什么服务”的文章，批评教会当局。文章说，由于华沙广泛传播的关于“异事”的谣言，每天傍晚都有一些人到诺沃利普基街来看圣奥古斯廷教堂铜塔顶在昏暗中、在好天气里发光或者发磷光。这种情况使这个地区的居民不安，同时也使一切普通的、理智的公民愤慨。差不多每天都有居民写信、打电话或直接到“华沙生活报”编辑部来问，他们什么时候才能得到安静？这种歇斯底里和迷信的浪潮什么时候才能结束？
    文章说，教会当局看到了这一切。只在几星期前向教徒发出呼吁说，教堂塔顶发光的铜片是正常现象，不要大批聚在教堂周围。但是这个呼吁没有产生任何效果。以后教会就采取十分冷漠、袖手旁观的态度，意味深长地沉默起来。而且，在诺沃利普基街上的人群中每天可以看到很多天主教僧侣、教会学生、修道士和修女，这些人在人群中非常活跃，干着某种暧昧的勾当。
    文章接着说，教会当局不能制止它的下属犯罪，这是不可想像的，我们认为，甚至确信，教会领导人拥有适当的手段使僧侣服从。天主教僧侣和修道士不听从教会当局的责任正是要由教会当局来负。
    文章最后说，歇斯底里和耸人听闻的浪潮正在安定下来。我们相信理智和公民的责任感将战胜迷信，将有效地反对蠢事和恶计。而对此负责的教会当局将记起自己的责任。
