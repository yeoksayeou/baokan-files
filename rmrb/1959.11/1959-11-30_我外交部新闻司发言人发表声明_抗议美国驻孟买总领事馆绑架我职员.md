Xinhua News Agency, November 29th. The spokesman of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China today issued a statement regarding the kidnapping of Zhang Qianyu, a staff member of the Chinese Consulate General in Bombay, by personnel of the US Consulate General in Bombay, India. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China has received a report from the Consulate General in Bombay stating that Zhang Qianyu, a staff member of the Chinese Consulate General in Bombay, was kidnapped by personnel of the US Consulate General in Bombay at approximately 11:00 AM on November 26th, and was detained at the US Consulate General and its facilities on the Bombay seaside until 7:00 AM the next day, the 27th, for a total of twenty hours. During this period, personnel of the US Consulate General used severe threats and brutal pressure to force Zhang Qianyu to make a statement against his own will, in order to cover up their criminal act of kidnapping Zhang Qianyu. When the American kidnappers transported Zhang Qianyu by car to Bombay City at 7:00 AM on the 27th, they passed near the Chinese Consulate General. Zhang Qianyu managed to escape back to the Chinese Consulate General. The US Consulate General personnel escorting him immediately chased after him with knives and were immediately discovered by personnel of the Chinese Consulate General. They prevented the American from committing violence, protected Zhang Qianyu, and immediately notified the Bombay police authorities by telephone. Subsequently, the Bombay Police Bureau sent someone to take the American away.

It can be clearly seen from the above facts that personnel of the US Consulate General in Bombay kidnapped Zhang Qianyu, a staff member of the Chinese Consulate General in Bombay. Such kidnapping crimes by personnel of US embassies and consulates abroad occur frequently and are well known to the world. The statement issued by US State Department spokesman Rips on November 27th, which completely distorts the truth and blames others, can only once again reveal the despicable face of the US government. I am instructed to express serious protest against this.

Xinhua News Agency, November 29th, Washington Dispatch: US State Department spokesman Rips issued a statement on November 27th that distorted the truth, insisting that the kidnapping of Zhang Qianyu, a staff member of the Chinese Consulate General in Bombay, by personnel of the US Consulate General in Bombay, India, was actually a kidnapping of Robert Armstrong, a US Marine Corps guard of the US Consulate General in Bombay, by personnel of the Chinese Consulate General in Bombay. According to this statement, after the personnel of the US Consulate General in Bombay kidnapped Zhang Qianyu to the US Consulate General on November 26th, they forced him to write "a statement." Rips' statement also fabricated the lie that Zhang Qianyu "requested asylum from the US government" as an excuse for their kidnapping of Zhang Qianyu. Rips' statement also revealed that after the US Consulate General personnel kidnapped Zhang Qianyu, US Marine Corps guard Armstrong escorted Zhang Qianyu to a "beach residence" outside Bombay City and detained him overnight.

    我外交部新闻司发言人发表声明
    抗议美国驻孟买总领事馆绑架我职员
    新华社29日讯　中华人民共和国外交部新闻司发言人今天就美国驻印度孟买总领事馆人员绑架中国驻孟买总领事馆职员张谦豫一事发表声明。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部接到驻孟买总领事馆的报告说：中国驻孟买总领事馆职员张谦豫于11月26日上午11时左右为美国驻孟买总领事馆人员所绑架，并且在美国总领事馆及其在孟买海滨的机关被扣留至第二天即27日晨七时，计达二十小时之久。在此期间，美国总领事馆人员用严重的威胁和粗暴的压力，强迫张谦豫作出违背自己意志的声明，以掩盖他们绑架张谦豫的罪恶行为。当美国绑架者于27日晨七时将张谦豫用汽车送至孟买市内时，路经中国总领事馆附近，张谦豫设法逃回中国总领事馆，押送的美国总领事馆人员立即持刀追赶，当即为中国总领事馆人员发现，他们一面阻止该美国人行凶，保护张谦豫，一面立即用电话通知了印度孟买警察当局，随后孟买警察局派人将该美国人带走。
    从上面的事实经过可以清楚地看出，美国驻孟买总领事馆的人员绑架了中国驻孟买总领事馆的职员张谦豫。美国驻外各使、领馆人员的这种绑架罪行是经常出现的，也是世人所共知的。美国国务院新闻官里普在11月27日发表了完全颠倒黑白、反噬别人的声明，只能再一次表明美国政府的卑污的面目。我奉命对此表示严重的抗议。
    新华社29日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院新闻官里普11月27日发表了一篇颠倒黑白的声明，把美国驻印度孟买总领事馆人员绑架中国驻孟买总领事馆职员张谦豫一事，硬说成是中国驻孟买总领事馆人员绑架了美国驻孟买总领事馆的一名美国海军陆战队的卫士罗伯特·阿姆斯特朗。据这个声明透露，美国驻孟买总领事馆人员在11月26日把张谦豫绑架到美国总领事馆后，曾经强迫他写“一篇声明”。里普的声明还捏造了张谦豫“请求美国政府给予避难权”的谎言，作为他们绑架张谦豫的借口。里普的声明还透露，美国总领事馆人员绑架了张谦豫以后，曾经由美国海军陆战队卫士阿姆斯特朗把张谦豫押到孟买市外的一座“海滩寓所”中扣押了一夜。
