Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 19th: According to TASS, New York Governor Rockefeller, speaking at a banquet held by the National Foreign Trade Association, opposed the normalization of trade and advocated the continued pursuit of a "Cold War" in international economic relations.

Rockefeller opposes normal trade between East and West. He said that "developing East-West trade" would create "problems" and suggested that "the U.S. Congress should establish an economic defense committee with considerable authority" to further restrict U.S. trade with socialist countries.

Rockefeller's "principles" also stipulate that at future East-West summit meetings, the Soviet Union should be forced to accept Western "trade regulations" "as a necessary condition for expanding East-West trade."

Rockefeller is particularly keen to maintain U.S. dominance in Latin America, as his family has substantial investments there and frequently derives huge profits from the region. He fiercely attacked "anti-American activities in Cuba, Panama, and other parts of Latin America" and called for the establishment of a "Pan-American Economic Union"—"an economic system in the Western Hemisphere that will trade with the rest of the world as a whole," which means that this system would be dominated by U.S. monopoly organizations.

    洛克菲勒又大放冷战厥词
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社纽约19日讯：纽约州州长洛克菲勒在全国对外贸易协会举行的宴会上发言反对贸易正常化，他鼓吹在国际经济关系中继续推行“冷战”。
    洛克菲勒反对东西方进行正常的贸易。他说什么“发展东西方贸易”会产生“问题”，并且建议“美国国会应当设立一个权限相当大的经济防御委员会”，以便进一步限制美国同社会主义阵营国家的贸易。
    洛克菲勒的“原则”还规定要在未来的东西方最高级会议上迫使苏联接受西方的“贸易条例”，“作为扩大东西方贸易的必要条件”。
    洛克菲勒特别热衷于维持美国在拉丁美洲的统治地位，因为他的家族在拉丁美洲有一笔不小的投资，并且经常从那里获得巨额的利润。他大肆攻击“古巴、巴拿马和拉丁美洲其他地区的反美活动”，并且呼吁成立“泛美经济联盟”——“西半球的经济体系，它将作为一个整体同世界其他国家贸易”，这就是说，这个体系要由美国垄断组织统治。
