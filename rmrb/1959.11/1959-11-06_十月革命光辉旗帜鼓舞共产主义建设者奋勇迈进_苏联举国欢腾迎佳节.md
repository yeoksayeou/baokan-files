    The Glorious Banner of the October Revolution Inspires Communist Builders to Advance Courageously
    The Soviet Union Rejoices to Welcome the Festival
    (People's Daily, Moscow, November 5th) As the great 42nd anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution approaches, the Soviet people are experiencing a multitude of joyous events: the Soviet Union has obtained the first-ever photographs of the far side of the moon, achieving an unprecedented scientific feat; the Third Session of the Supreme Soviet has preliminarily summarized the outstanding achievements in realizing the Seven-Year Plan and determined the plan for the continued high-speed development of the Soviet national economy in 1960; and Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States has achieved a major victory for the peaceful diplomatic policy. On the eve of such an inspiring festival, the Soviet working people are in a state of fervent political and labor upsurge, with reports of labor successes and firm voices declaring the determination to realize the 1960 plan and implement Lenin's peaceful diplomatic policy spreading throughout the country. All economic regions have completed their industrial gross output plan for the first ten months ahead of schedule.

    A large blast furnace recently built at the Nizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Combine was successfully ignited and produced iron on the morning of the 3rd, ahead of schedule, as a gift to the festival. Thus, the builders of this blast furnace have victoriously realized their solemn pledge to complete the construction of the blast furnace and produce iron two months ahead of schedule. The workers of the Uzbek Lenin Metallurgical Plant have already completed their task of overfulfilling this year's plan for smelting metal in the socialist competition to welcome the 42nd anniversary. This achievement was made by the metallurgical workers who increased labor productivity by 3% under the recently adopted six-hour workday. Many steelworkers in this factory have produced several hundred tons of steel above the plan after completing their ten-month plan. The Leningrad Metal Plant, which is rushing to manufacture orders for the Stalingrad Hydropower Station, has already produced the nineteenth rotary blade turbine with an energy of 126,000 kilowatts ahead of schedule. A month ago, the workers originally decided to install it successfully on November 7 as a gift for the festival. However, after the opening of the Third Session of the Supreme Soviet, the workers were inspired by the conference and decided to make further efforts, and as a result, they completed the installation of the turbine on November 1.

    At meetings where people enthusiastically discuss the documents and reports of the Third Session of the Supreme Soviet, they unanimously support the plan for continued high-speed development next year and Khrushchev's report, and they have all made resolutions and guarantees to achieve the grand plan of communist construction with better labor. Moscow worker Bushuyev said during a discussion that the 1960 national economic development plan most eloquently proves the Soviet people's desire for peace. Minsk Tractor Factory worker Shcherbina said that the output of machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries will increase by 12% in 1960. This is a huge increase, and we are particularly pleased that our factory workers have entered the competition to increase labor productivity. Employees in various industrial departments have expressed their intention to make the greatest contribution to the overall mechanization, automation and technological innovation of production.

    Agricultural workers, like workers, are also making labor contributions for the festival. Good news of completing this year's plan for the sale of agricultural and livestock products ahead of schedule is constantly coming. Leningrad and Brest regions completed the annual sales plan for livestock products two months ahead of schedule on October 31. Collective farms and state farms in the Leningrad region will sell more than 20,000 tons of milk to the state before the end of the year beyond the plan. Agricultural workers in Samarkand region have also completed the sales plan for cotton, grain, meat, milk, wool, etc. ahead of schedule, of which cotton sales are more than 168,000 tons more than last year.

    十月革命光辉旗帜鼓舞共产主义建设者奋勇迈进
    苏联举国欢腾迎佳节
    本报莫斯科5日电　在这伟大十月社会主义革命四十二周年的节日即将来到的日子里，苏联人民正是喜事重重：苏联在人类历史上第一次获得了月球背面的照片，建立了史无前例的科学功勋；最高苏维埃第三次会议初步总结了实现七年计划的杰出成就，确定了1960年苏联国民经济继续高速发展的计划；赫鲁晓夫同志访问美国所取得的和平外交政策的重大胜利。在这样令人振奋的节日前夕，苏联劳动人民都已处在沸腾的政治和劳动热潮中，劳动捷报和一定要实现1960年计划、贯彻列宁和平外交政策的坚定声音，传遍了全国各地。各经济区提前完成头十个月的工业总产值计划。
    最近下塔吉尔钢铁联合工厂建成的一座大型高炉，已在3日上午提前生火出铁，作为献给节日的礼物。这样，这个高炉的建设者已胜利实现了他们原来提出的提前两个月建成高炉出铁的庄严保证。乌兹别克列宁冶金工厂职工们在为迎接四十二周年的社会主义竞赛中，已经提前完成了自己所承担的今年超计划熔炼金属的任务。这个成绩是冶金工人们在最近过度的六小时工作日的条件下使劳动生产率提高3％取得的。这个工厂的许多炼钢工人都在完成十个月计划后超计划多生产了几百吨钢。正在为斯大林格勒水电站赶制订货的列宁格勒金属工厂，已经提前制成第十九台能量为十二万六千瓩的旋转轮叶涡轮机。一个月前，职工们原决定在11月7日安装成功，作为对节日的献礼。但在最高苏维埃第三次会议开幕后，职工们被大会所鼓舞，决定再加把劲，结果在11月1日就完成了这台涡轮机的安装工作。
    各地群众在热烈讨论最高苏维埃第三次会议文件和报告的会上，都一致拥护明年继续高速发展计划和赫鲁晓夫的报告，并且都纷纷下决心提保证，要以更好的劳动来实现共产主义建设宏伟计划。莫斯科工人布舒耶夫在座谈时说，1960年国民经济发展计划最雄辩地证明了苏联人民的爱好和平的愿望。明斯克拖拉机工厂工人谢尔宾纳说，1960年机器制造业和金属加工业的产品将增加12％。这是一个巨大的增长，我们感到特别高兴，我们工厂职工已投入了为提高劳动生产率的竞赛。各工业部门的职工都表示，要在生产全面机械化、自动化和技术革新方面作出最大的贡献。
    农业劳动者也和工人一样在为节日劳动献礼。提前完成今年农产品和畜产品交售计划的喜讯在不断传来。列宁格勒和布勒斯特州在10月31日提前两个月完成了畜产品全年交售计划。列宁格勒州各农庄和农场都要在年前超计划多卖给国家二万多吨牛奶。萨马尔罕州农业劳动者也提前完成了棉花、粮食、肉、奶、羊毛等交售计划，其中棉花比去年多交售了十六万八千多吨。
