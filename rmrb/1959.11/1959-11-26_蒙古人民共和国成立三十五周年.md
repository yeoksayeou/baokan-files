The 35th Anniversary of the Founding of the Mongolian People's Republic
Dun·Shalab, Ambassador of the Mongolian People's Republic to China

November 26th marks the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Mongolian People's Republic.

The founding of the Mongolian People's Republic fulfilled the aspirations of the broad masses of Mongolian working people, realizing the hopes of our people in their generations-long struggle for freedom and independence.

The Mongolian People's Republic was able to be founded thanks to the victory of the People's Revolution in 1921, led by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and its leaders Sukhe Bator and Choibalsan, and thanks to the world-historically significant victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

On July 10, 1921, after the liberation of the Mongolian capital, Ikh Khuree, the Provisional Government, formed on March 13 of the same year at the conference of the Party, guerrillas, and farmers in the northern region, was reorganized into the People's Revolutionary Government. On July 11, 1921, a ceremony was held to mark the establishment of the new government, which retained the title of the Bogd Khan's constitutional monarchy. Our Party and the People's Government ensured their leading role in governing the country.

With the development of the revolution, the contradiction between the popular nature of the state and the monarchical form of government also grew. After the death of Bogd Khan, the enormous changes that had taken place in Mongolian life led our Party to adopt a resolution to abolish the monarchy. The Third Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, held in August 1924, clearly defined the Party's general line: to eliminate feudalism and create conditions for the country to gradually transition to a non-capitalist path of development, moving towards socialism.

On November 26, 1924, the First Great People's Khural adopted the first Constitution of the Mongolian People's Republic. This constitution consolidated the achievements of the Mongolian working people and became a powerful weapon for the Mongolian people to eliminate feudalism and prepare the conditions for the country to embark on the path of socialist development.

Simultaneously with the elimination of the old feudal state organs and the establishment of new, people's democratic state organs, measures were also taken to eliminate the influence of feudal lords in the country's economic life. Between 1929 and 1930, the property of secular and religious feudal lords was confiscated and distributed to poor herdsmen.

While eliminating feudal relations, another task was also solved: preparing the necessary conditions for the Mongolian economy to break away from capitalist countries and gain independence. In the early years after the revolution, there were more than two thousand foreign companies in the country, including British, American, and German companies. In the country's exports, foreign companies accounted for 60.7% in 1926, and in imports, they accounted for 77.6%. In eliminating the country's dependence on the capitalist world, the new currency, the Tugrik, issued in April 1928, the decree on state monopoly of foreign trade adopted in December 1930, and the establishment and consolidation of state and cooperative components in the national economy played a huge role.

By 1940, as a result of a long and brutal struggle, the feudal landlord class had been completely eliminated, the rampant usurers had been eradicated, and economic dependence on capitalist countries had been completely eliminated. Thus, the first stage of the Mongolian revolution—the anti-feudal, anti-imperialist, and generally democratic stage—had been basically completed by 1940, and the revolution immediately entered the next stage—the socialist stage.

On June 30, 1940, the Eighth Great People's Khural approved the new Constitution of the Mongolian People's Republic. The years following the adoption of this constitution have been years of smooth economic development, flourishing national culture, and rising welfare for the Mongolian people. During these years, the international status of the Mongolian People's Republic as an independent and sovereign state has been further consolidated. During the Second World War, the Mongolian People's Republic made its own contribution to the struggle of freedom-loving peoples against Hitlerite fascism and the crushing of imperialist Japan.

The close cooperation between the Mongolian People's Republic and the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries is a guarantee for the victorious realization of our country's socialist construction tasks.

The emergence and development of socialist components in the national economy of the Mongolian People's Republic has created conditions for the planned and proportionate development of the national economy. Under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, with the comprehensive assistance of the great Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, the Mongolian people have victoriously realized the tasks of the first and second five-year plans. Now they are working selflessly to complete and overfulfill the tasks of the three-year plan for the development of the national economy (1958-1960).

In the process of realizing the two five-year plans and striving to complete the three-year plan, our country has achieved great success in developing socialist agriculture—agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, state-owned farms, and livestock machinery stations. Now, 99.3% of agricultural and pastoral households have joined agricultural and pastoral cooperatives. Due to the victory of the agricultural cooperative system, the socialist mode of production has been firmly established in our country's economy. Agricultural and pastoral cooperatives are successfully fulfilling the plan to increase the total number of livestock. In 1958, agricultural and pastoral cooperatives completed 110.8% of the plan to increase the total number of livestock, and in 1959, the total number of livestock in agricultural and pastoral cooperatives will increase by 22.2%. The Party and the government have always attached great importance to consolidating agricultural and pastoral cooperatives. The upcoming December Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party will discuss the issue of further strengthening agricultural and pastoral cooperatives organizationally and economically.

Livestock machinery stations, equipped with tractors, combine harvesters, and other modern agricultural machinery, help agricultural and pastoral cooperatives to complete all major heavy work, such as preparing feed for livestock, shearing sheep, artificially inseminating livestock, and cultivating land, and also assist cooperatives in agricultural construction and other aspects. In 1959, the number of livestock machinery stations increased nearly threefold compared to 1946.

State-owned farms are highly mechanized and economically advantageous organizations that set an example for model economic management and provide possible assistance to agricultural and pastoral cooperatives. In 1959, the number of state-owned farms doubled compared to 1952. This October, a production conference of leaders and experts from state-owned farms was held, which summarized the work of agricultural laborers in land reclamation and agricultural development in 1959 and determined the task of further increasing agricultural production.

At present, the Mongolian People's Republic ranks first in the world in terms of the number of livestock per capita. In the era of the people's government, the total number of livestock has increased by 1.5 times. This year, the total number of livestock increased by 1.9% compared to 1958.

The network of Mongolian veterinary stations is expanding day by day. In 1958, the number of veterinary stations increased to 1.4 times that of 1953, and the number of laboratories and first-aid stations also doubled. In order to exchange experiences and discuss scientific and practical issues, a republic-wide conference of breeders and veterinary workers will be held in 1960. According to the three-year plan, the total number of livestock in our country in 1960 will increase by 7.2% compared to 1957, and the productivity of livestock products will be greatly improved.

While developing traditional animal husbandry, agriculture also has an increasingly important significance in the national economy of the Mongolian People's Republic. In 1958, the sown area in the country increased by 30.4% compared to 1957; this year it increased by 43% compared to last year. In 1958, the national grain output increased by 64% compared to 1957, and in 1959, the grain output of state-owned farms alone nearly doubled compared to 1958. The yield per unit area of all crops has also greatly increased, especially the grain yield of state-owned farms, which increased by 20% in 1958 compared to 1957. This year, some grain crops in state-owned farms can achieve a yield of 24.4 quintals per hectare, and in some areas, the harvest reaches 25 to 30 quintals per hectare. Advanced methods such as staged harvesting have also been adopted in agriculture.

According to the three-year plan, one of the tasks of the Mongolian People's Republic in the next two or three years is to ensure domestic self-sufficiency in flour by means of land reclamation. In 1960, the sown area of wheat alone will be 1.2 times more than the national sown area in 1957, and the grain output will double that of 1957. Currently, the Mongolian People's Republic is studying the establishment of irrigation systems and formulating plans to build a major irrigation system of 40,000 hectares.

During the era of the people's government, our own industry was established. The industrial output value accounts for more than 40% of the total output value of industry and agriculture. In 1921 before the revolution, Mongolia did not have any developed national industry, and the industrial output value in 1958 was 5.4 times that of 1940. According to the population, the increase in 1958 compared to 1940 is as follows: electricity increased by 5.5 times; coal - 1.3 times; leather shoes - 2 times; cream - 14.5 times, etc. The industrial production plan for the first nine months of this year has been completed by 100.3%, and the total industrial output has increased by 6.7% compared to the same period last year, of which the production of means of production increased by 5.3%, and the production of consumer goods increased by 12%.

Now, the industrial output of the Mongolian People's Republic in one day is equivalent to the output of the entire year of 1930.

According to the draft of the 1961-1965 five-year plan, the total industrial output value in 1965 will increase by 60% compared to 1960, the last year of the three-year plan, that is, it will increase to 2.4 times that of 1957.

The Mongolian people have also achieved great success in basic construction and transportation. The effective usable area of various buildings put into use this year has doubled compared to 1958. The number of construction workers, engineers, and technicians has increased to 80 times that of 1937. During the first and second five-year plans, the Sukhe Bator-Ulaanbaatar-Zamiin-Uud railway trunk line, 1,100 kilometers long, was built. In recent years, Mongolia's civil aviation industry has also developed rapidly. The capital Ulaanbaatar also has regular international routes to Beijing and Irkutsk in the Soviet Union.

The domestic and foreign trade of the Mongolian People's Republic are entirely in the hands of the state. According to the three-year plan for the development of the national economy of Mongolia, the retail commodity turnover in 1960 will increase by 31% compared to 1957. Now, the Mongolian People's Republic conducts trade with countries of the socialist camp, some countries in Asia and Africa, as well as some companies in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and other countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In 1959, our country conducted trade negotiations with Japan. According to the three-year plan, the total foreign trade volume will increase by 15 million Tugriks.

The Mongolian people have made great achievements in cultural construction. In the era of the people's government, Mongolia has transformed from a country where almost all people were illiterate into a country where everyone is literate.

In the 1959-1960 academic year, compared with the previous academic year, the number of students in general education schools increased by 3.2%, the number of students in technical secondary schools increased by 7.8%, and the number of students in universities increased by 5%.

In the first nine months of 1959, compared with the same period last year, the number of hospitals increased by 3.5%, medical stations increased by 4.6%, nurseries increased by 25%, and pharmacies increased by 5.1%. Now, each county medical station serves an average of about 2,100 people, and there is an average of one doctor for every 1,000 residents in the country.

The network of cultural and educational institutions is spread throughout the country. There are now 26 newspapers and 16 magazines published domestically, with a total circulation of nearly 100 million copies. Mongolia's literature and art are like a blooming flower. The upsurge of marching towards culture is flourishing throughout the country.

Huge scientific research work is being carried out according to the 1957-1960 long-term plan. In September of this year, an international conference of Mongolian language and literature scholars was held in Ulaanbaatar, with scholars from socialist countries and the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Finland, India, Japan, and other countries participating.

Expenditures on social and cultural measures are increasing year by year, accounting for 38.4% of the total state budget expenditures.

In the Mongolian People's Republic, the living welfare of the working people is gradually improving. In August 1958, Mongolia reduced the retail prices of 495 kinds of daily necessities and food, which was the third price reduction in the last four years. The newly promulgated State Preferential Treatment Law greatly expanded the amount and scope of preferential treatment. In the second five-year plan, the actual wages of employees increased by 40%, and the actual income of herdsmen and members of agricultural and pastoral cooperatives increased by 60%. By the completion of the three-year plan, the wages of employees will increase by 12.9%.

The achievements made by the Mongolian people in socialist construction are the result of the correct policies implemented by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Republic's government, and the result of the selfless and comprehensive assistance from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries of the socialist camp. The Mongolian people and their government have always been concerned with consolidating and developing friendly and close cooperation with all countries in the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

The Mongolian People's Republic has received recognition and support in diplomatic relations from the Soviet Union, other countries of the socialist camp, and India, Burma, and Indonesia, which have more than half of the world's population. The friendly visits to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of India by the government delegation headed by Tsedenbal, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, in 1959, are a vivid manifestation of the peaceful and friendly policy implemented by the government of the Mongolian People's Republic.

The foreign policy of the Mongolian People's Republic is aimed at consolidating international peace and friendship. The Mongolian people wholeheartedly welcome the successful visit of Soviet Premier Khrushchev to the United States and warmly support the Soviet government's proposal for comprehensive and complete disarmament.

The Mongolian people are celebrating the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Mongolian People's Republic in a situation where they have gained new strength in the struggle for peaceful cooperation among all countries and the international situation has been significantly eased.

The Mongolian people are pleased that the fraternal friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples has a long history. In the ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our two peoples have established a new type of sincere fraternal relationship under the common goal of building socialism. This fraternal relationship has developed and strengthened on the principles of proletarian internationalism and mutual assistance. On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Mongolian People's Republic, our people express their heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people and government and Comrade Mao Zedong for their valuable and selfless assistance in our country's socialist construction.

Our people are watching with great interest the principled Marxist-Leninist policy implemented by the People's Republic of China, praising the great achievements made by the fraternal Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward and the new tasks they have put before themselves—completing the main indicators stipulated in the second five-year plan within this year.

Now, the People's Republic of China is a bastion of peace in Asia and the world. The peaceful foreign policy of the People's Republic of China has won the sympathy of all progressive humanity. Now all attempts by imperialism to undermine the prestige of the People's Republic of China on the international stage are doomed to failure.

Like all peace-loving people in the world, Mongolian public opinion believes that the People's Republic of China should obtain its legitimate position in the United Nations and condemns US imperialism for illegally occupying China's inseparable territory of Taiwan and the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on the so-called "Tibetan issue" which grossly interferes in China's internal affairs.

Now there is no force in the world that can stop the victorious advance of the 650 million Chinese people.

We wholeheartedly wish the fraternal Chinese people greater achievements in the socialist construction of their country and in the struggle for peace and friendship among the peoples of all countries.

    蒙古人民共和国成立三十五周年
    蒙古人民共和国驻华大使  敦·沙拉布
    11月26日是蒙古人民共和国成立的三十五周年。
    蒙古人民共和国的成立，实现了蒙古广大劳动群众的想望，使我国人民世世代代在争取自由和独立的斗争中的期望得到实现。
    蒙古人民共和国之所以能成立，是由于1921年在蒙古人民革命党及其领袖苏赫巴托尔和乔巴山领导下的人民革命的胜利，由于伟大的十月社会主义革命的具有世界历史意义的胜利。
    1921年7月10日，在蒙古首都伊赫呼列解放后，同年3月13日在党、游击队和北部地区农民会议上成立的临时政府，改组为人民革命政府。1921年7月11日，举行了新政府成立典礼，政府保留了博格多格根君主立宪制的君主称号。我们的党和人民政府保证了在管理国家方面的领导作用。
    随着革命的发展，国家的人民性和君主制的管理形式之间的矛盾也日益增长了。在博格多格根死后，蒙古人民生活中发生的巨大变革，使我们的党通过了废除君主制的决议。1924年8月举行的蒙古人民革命党第三次代表大会，明确地决定了党的总路线，即消灭封建主义，为使国家逐步过渡到非资本主义的发展道路，向社会主义前进创造条件。
    1924年11月26日，第一届大人民呼拉尔通过了蒙古人民共和国第一部宪法。这部宪法巩固了蒙古劳动人民获得的成就，成为蒙古人民消灭封建主义和为使国家走上社会主义的发展道路准备条件的有力武器。
    与消灭旧的封建的国家机关和建立新的、人民民主的国家机关的同时，也采取了消灭封建主在国家经济生活中的影响的措施。在1929年至1930年间，没收了世俗和宗教的封建主的财产，并把这些财产分配给穷苦的牧民。
    在消灭封建关系的时候，也解决了另一项任务，即准备必要的条件使蒙古经济摆脱资本主义国家而获得独立。在革命后的最初几年，国内有两千多家外国公司，其中包括英国、美国和德国的公司。在国家的出口中，1926年外国公司所占的比例是60.7％，而在进口中占77.6％。在消除国家对资本主义世界的依赖方面，1928年4月发行的新币图格里克、1930年12月通过的关于国家垄断对外贸易的法令、国民经济中国家和合作社成分之建立和巩固，都起了巨大的作用。
    到1940年，由于长期的残酷斗争的结果，已经彻底消灭了封建主阶级，根除了高利贷主的横行霸道，彻底消灭了对资本主义国家经济上的依赖。这样，蒙古革命的第一阶段——反封建、反帝国主义、普遍民主的阶段，到1940年业已基本完成，革命立即转入下一个阶段——社会主义阶段。
    1940年6月30日第八届大人民呼拉尔批准了蒙古人民共和国的新宪法，这个宪法通过以后的年代，是经济顺利发展，民族文化繁荣，蒙古人民福利高涨的年代。在这些年代里，作为独立和主权国家的蒙古人民共和国的国际地位更加巩固了。第二次世界大战期内，蒙古人民共和国为爱好自由的各国人民反对希特勒法西斯和粉碎帝国主义的日本的斗争作出了自己力所能及的贡献。
    蒙古人民共和国和苏联、中华人民共和国及其他人民民主国家的紧密合作是胜利实现我国社会主义建设任务的保证。
    蒙古人民共和国的国民经济中社会主义成分的产生和发展为有计划按比例地发展国民经济创造了条件。蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，在伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家的全面援助下胜利地实现了第一个和第二个五年计划的任务。现在他们正在为完成和超额完成发展国民经济的三年计划任务（1958—1960年）而进行忘我的劳动。
    在实现两个五年计划和为争取完成三年计划而斗争的过程中，我国在发展社会主义农业——农牧业合作社、国营农牧场和畜牧业机器站等方面获得了巨大的成就。现在已有99.3％农牧户加入了农牧业合作社。由于农业合作社制度的胜利，我国的经济牢固地确立了社会主义的生产方式。农牧业合作社正顺利地完成增殖牲畜总头数的计划。1958年农牧业合作社完成了增殖牲畜总头数计划的110.8％，而1959年农牧业合作社的牲畜总头数将增加22.2％。党和政府过去和现在都非常重视巩固农牧业合作社。即将举行的蒙古人民革命党中央委员会十二月全会，将讨论进一步在组织上和经济上巩固农牧业合作社的问题。
    以拖拉机、收割联合机和其他现代化农业机器装备的畜牧业机器站帮助农牧业合作社完成一切主要的繁重工作，例如为牲畜准备饲料，剪羊毛，用人工法使牲畜受胎及耕地等，同时在农业建筑和其他方面也帮助了合作社。1959年畜牧业机器站比1946年增加了近三倍。
    国营农场是具有高度机械化和有利的经济组织，它为模范的经济管理树立了榜样，并对农牧业合作社予以可能的援助。1959年国营农场的数目比1952年增加了一倍。今年10月里曾举行国营农场的领导工作者和专家的生产会议，这次会议总结了农业劳动者1959年在开垦荒地和发展农业方面的工作，并确定了进一步提高农业生产的任务。
    现在，蒙古人民共和国按人口计算，牲畜的头数已占世界第一位。在人民政权年代，牲畜总头数增加了一点五倍。今年牲畜总头数比1958年增加1.9％。
    蒙古兽医站网日益扩大。1958年兽医站比1953年增加到一点四倍，实验室和急救站也增加一倍。为了交换经验和讨论科学实践问题，将于1960年召开共和国的饲养员和兽医工作会议。根据三年计划，1960年我国牲畜的总头数将比1957年增加7.2％，并将大大提高牲畜的产品生产率。
    在发展传统的畜牧业的同时，农业在蒙古人民共和国国民经济中也具有日益重大的意义。1958年全国播种面积比1957年增加了30.4％；今年比去年增加了43％。1958年全国谷物产量比1957年增加了64％，而1959年仅仅是国营农牧场的谷物产量就比1958年增加了近一倍。全部农作物的单位面积产量也大大地增加了，其中特别是国营农牧场的谷物产量，1958年比1957年增加了20％。今年国营农牧场的一些谷类作物，一公顷可获得二十四点四公担的产量，个别地区每公顷收获量达二十五公担到三十公担。农业中也采用了进步的方法，如分段收割法等。
    根据三年计划，蒙古人民共和国在最近两三年内的任务之一是通过开荒的办法保证国内面粉自给。1960年仅小麦的播种面积就要比1957年全国的播种面积还要多一点二倍，而谷物产量将比1957年增加二倍。目前蒙古人民共和国正在研究建立灌溉系统和制定修筑四万公顷的主要灌溉系统的计划。
    在人民政权时期，建立了本国的工业。工业产值占工农业总产值的40％以上。在革命前的1921年，蒙古没有一点发达的民族工业，而1958年的工业产值就为1940年的五点四倍。按人口计算，1958年比1940年增加的情况如下：电力增加了五点五倍；煤——一点三倍；皮鞋——二倍；奶油——十四点五倍等。今年头九个月的工业生产计划已完成了100.3％，工业总产量比去年同时期增加了6.7％，其中，生产资料的生产增长了5.3％，消费品的生产增长了12％。
    现在蒙古人民共和国一天的工业产量就相当于1930年全年的产量。
    根据1961—1965年的五年计划草案的规定，1965年工业总产值将比三年计划的最后一年1960年增长60％，即增加到1957年的二点四倍。
    蒙古人民在基本建设，交通运输等方面也获得了巨大的成就。今年开始动用的各种建筑物的有效使用面积比1958年增加了二倍。建筑工人、工程师和技术人员的数目已增加为1937年的八十倍。在第一个、第二个五年计划期间建成了苏赫巴托尔——乌兰巴托——札门乌得的长达一千一百公里的铁道干线。最近几年里蒙古的民用航空事业也得到了迅速的发展。首都乌兰巴托还和北京、苏联的伊尔库次克也有定期的国际航线。
    蒙古人民共和国的国内贸易和对外贸易全部掌握在国家手里。根据蒙古发展国民经济的三年计划规定，1960年零售商品交易额将比1957年增加31％。现在，蒙古人民共和国在平等、互利的基础上同社会主义阵营各国、亚洲、非洲一些国家以及瑞士、英国和其他国家的一些公司进行贸易。1959年我国和日本进行了贸易谈判。根据三年计划规定全部对外贸易额将增加一千五百万图格里克。
    蒙古人民在文化建设方面取得了很大的成就，在人民政权的年代里，蒙古从一个人民差不多都是文盲的国家变成一个人人识字的国家。
    1959—1960学年与上学年比较，普通教育学校的学生增加了3.2％，技术专科学校的学生增加了7.8％，高等学校的学生增加了5％。
    1959年头九个月与去年同期比较，医院增加了3.5％，医疗站增加4.6％，托儿所增加25％，药房增加5.1％。现在，每一个县医疗站平均约为二千一百人服务，而全国平均每一千多居民即有一个医生。
    文化教育机关网布满了全国。现在国内出版二十六种报纸和十六种杂志，其总发行量将近一亿份。蒙古的文学艺术像是一朵盛开的鲜花。向文化进军的高潮正在全国蓬勃展开。
    巨大的科学研究工作正在根据1957—1960年远景计划进行着。今年9月，在乌兰巴托召开了有社会主义国家和美国、英国、加拿大、芬兰、印度、日本以及其它国家的学者参加的国际蒙古语文学者会议。
    在社会文化措施方面的经费开支一年比一年增多，这笔数字占国家预算全部开支的38.4％。
    在蒙古人民共和国，劳动人民的生活福利逐渐提高着，1958年8月蒙古降低了四百九十五种生活日用品和食品的零售价格，这是最近四年来第三次降低物价。新颁布的国家优抚金法大大扩大了优抚金额和优抚的范围。在第二个五年计划内职工的实际工资增长了40％，牧民和农牧业合作社社员的实际收入增长了60％。到三年计划完成时，职工的工资将增长12.9％。
    蒙古人民在建设社会主义方面所取得的成就，是蒙古人民革命党和共和国政府所执行的正确政策的结果，是苏联、中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营其他国家无私而全面援助的结果。蒙古人民及其政府一直关心在和平共处的五项原则的基础上同世界各国的友好与紧密合作得到巩固和发展。
    蒙古人民共和国在外交关系上得到了拥有全世界人口一半以上的苏联、社会主义阵营其他国家和印度、缅甸和印度尼西亚的承认和支持。以蒙古人民共和国部长会议主席泽登巴尔为首的政府代表团，于1959年在越南民主共和国和印度共和国进行的友好访问，就是蒙古人民共和国政府所执行的和平友好政策的鲜明表现。
    蒙古人民共和国对外政策的方针是巩固国际和平和友谊。蒙古人民衷心地欢迎苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在美国进行的成功的访问，并热烈拥护苏联政府关于全面和彻底裁军的建议。
    蒙古人民是在争取各国人民和平合作的斗争获得了新的力量和国际局势得到显著缓和的情况下来庆祝蒙古人民共和国成立三十五周年的。
    蒙古人民高兴的是，蒙古和中国人民之间的兄弟友谊具有长远的历史。在中华人民共和国成立以来的十年内，我们两国人民在建设社会主义的共同目标下确立了新型的真挚的兄弟关系。这种兄弟关系在无产阶级国际主义和互助的原则上发展和巩固了起来。在蒙古人民共和国成立三十五周年的时候，我国人民对于在我国社会主义建设事业中给予了我们宝贵的无私援助的中国人民和政府以及毛泽东同志，表示衷心的感谢。
    我国人民以很大的兴趣注视着中华人民共和国所执行的马克思列宁主义原则性的政策，称赞兄弟般的中国人民在大跃进中取得的伟大成就和在自己面前提出来的新的任务——在今年内完成第二个五年计划所规定的主要指标。
    现在中华人民共和国是亚洲和全世界的和平堡垒。中华人民共和国的和平的外交政策赢得了全体进步人类的同情。现在帝国主义在国际舞台上想降低中华人民共和国威望的一切企图都注定要遭到失败。
    同全世界爱好和平的人民一样，蒙古舆论界认为中华人民共和国应当在联合国得到合法的地位，并谴责美帝国主义非法占领中国不可分割的领土台湾和联合国大会关于粗暴地干涉中国内政的所谓“西藏问题”的决议。
    现在世界上没有什么力量能够阻挡住中国六亿五千万人民胜利前进的步伐。
    衷心地祝兄弟般的中国人民在自己国家社会主义建设中，在争取各国人民的和平和友谊的斗争中，取得更大的成就。
