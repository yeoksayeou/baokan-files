　　(Our dispatch from Yinchuan, November 15th) In Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region's coal industry system, under the slogan of "Safety Well Managed, Production Leaps High," a mass safety production inspection has been launched. Cadres from all coal mines in the region have gone deep into the mines, working alongside the miners to conduct a thorough inspection of all work surfaces and formulate measures. This has greatly boosted the miners' enthusiasm, promoting a further surge in the production competition movement.

　　Many coal mines, from the very beginning of the safety production inspection, conducted extensive airing of views, debates, and criticisms, challenging the erroneous thinking among a few cadres of "emphasizing production and neglecting safety" and "maintaining the status quo." Under the leadership of the Party Committee Secretary, a safety inspection committee was established, consisting of bureau chiefs, mine directors, chief engineers, technicians, and veteran workers. Cadres and workers together presented the situation, identified weaknesses, and inspected all problems, large and small, without missing a single one. In a short period of half a month, cadres and workers identified more than 150 weaknesses that did not meet the requirements of safe production in the mines.

　　At the same time, adhering to the principle of "inspecting and improving simultaneously," all mines relied on the masses to revise safety measures and quickly resolve problems. Most of the problems revealed by the Shizuishan Mining Bureau have already been solved. The main measures they have taken are: (1) establishing a mass safety inspection network, ensuring that every shift and every team has inspectors; (2) strengthening leadership at the forefront, establishing a mine director and technician duty system, reporting problems promptly, and strengthening scheduling work; (3) strengthening safety education, in addition to daily education, also stipulating that every Saturday is a safety activity day, specifically discussing safety operating procedures and inspecting safety work; (4) focusing on weak links, running various operation training classes to cultivate various backbones of underground production. In this way, a situation has been formed where everyone is responsible for safety. The workers' production enthusiasm is even higher, with an average attendance rate of 90% in September and reaching 95% in October. In October, the region's raw coal production was higher every ten days, exceeding the entire month's task by 15%.

　　Currently, on the basis of the safety production inspection, all coal mine workers in the region are determined to make another effort to thoroughly improve safety production work.

### 撒遍安全网生产旬旬红  宁夏煤矿开展鸣放辩论  发动群众堵塞大小漏洞

    撒遍安全网生产旬旬红
    宁夏煤矿开展鸣放辩论
    发动群众堵塞大小漏洞
    本报银川15日电　宁夏回族自治区煤炭工业系统，在“安全搞得好，生产跃得高”的口号下，展开了群众性的安全生产检查。全区各煤矿的干部深入井下，和工人一起，对所有工作面作了一次较彻底的检查，制订了措施。这就大大鼓舞了工人的干劲，促使生产竞赛运动进一步高涨。
    许多煤矿从安全生产检查一开始，就进行了大鸣、大放、大辩论，批判了少数干部中存在的“重生产、轻安全”和“能维持就维持”等错误思想。在党委书记领导下，成立了由局长、矿长、总工程师、技术员、老工人参加的安全检查委员会。干部和工人一起，摆情况，找弱点，一处不漏地检查了大小问题。在短短半个月中，干部和工人就检查出了不符合井下安全生产的弱点一百五十多处。
    同时，各矿在“边检查、边改进”的原则下，依靠群众，重新修订了安全措施，迅速解决问题。石咀山矿务局揭发出来的问题，已大部分解决。他们采取的主要措施有：（1）建立群众性的安全检查网，做到了每班、每组都有检查员；（2）加强第一线的领导，建立了矿长、技术员值班制度，发现问题及时汇报，并加强了调度工作；（3）加强安全教育，除日常教育外，还规定每星期六为安全活动日，专门讨论安全作业规程及检查安全工作；（4）抓薄弱环节，开办各种作业训练班，培养井下生产的各种骨干。这样，就形成了人人管安全的局面。工人生产情绪更高，9月份平均出勤率为90％，而10月份达到95％。10月份全区原煤生产一旬高过一旬，超额15％完成了全月任务。
    目前，全区煤炭职工在安全生产检查的基础上，决心再鼓一把劲，彻底搞好安全生产工作。
