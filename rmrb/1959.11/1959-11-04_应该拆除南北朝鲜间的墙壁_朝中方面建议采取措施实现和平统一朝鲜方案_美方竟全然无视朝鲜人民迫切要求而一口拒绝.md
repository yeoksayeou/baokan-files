Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd: A message from Panmunjom: At today's meeting of the Military Armistice Commission, Zhu Changjun, Senior General of the Korean and Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, suggested that the Military Armistice Commission take corresponding measures to enable the peaceful reunification plan of Korea, which was recently adopted at the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, to be realized. He also demanded that the US military immediately withdraw from South Korea.

General Zhu Changjun suggested: In accordance with the provisions of Articles 7, 8, and 9 of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Military Armistice Commission should allow the following personnel to freely pass through the northern and southern edges of the Demilitarized Zone and the Military Demarcation Line to and from the military control areas of the other party: Representatives of the North and South Korean National Assemblies, governments, political parties, and social organizations, as well as other people, to establish a standing committee to discuss issues related to the peaceful reunification of Korea, such as holding free elections throughout Korea; Representatives of the economic circles of North and South Korea, to establish a standing committee for economic development and exchange between North and South Korea, and to consult on issues related to the economic development and economic exchange between North and South Korea, which are unrelated to political issues and are only for liaison and regulation; Personnel who intend to travel to and from the other party's military control areas for other non-military purposes, such as mutual exchange of scientific achievements, mutual dispatch of art troupes for performances, mutual dispatch of sports teams for competitions, and mutual visits, sightseeing, and family visits, for the sake of scientific, educational, and cultural exchange between North and South Korea.

General Zhu Changjun suggested that, in order to facilitate the movement of the above-mentioned personnel between North and South Korea, the Military Armistice Commission should designate Panmunjom and the Cheorwon area, as well as other areas on the Military Demarcation Line agreed upon by both parties, as free movement areas; both parties shall be responsible for ensuring the personal safety and freedom of movement of the above-mentioned personnel within their respective military control areas.

General Zhu Changjun emphasized: "For the peaceful reunification of Korea, and for peace in the Far East and the world, I demand that your side, in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, immediately withdraw the United States Army and all other foreign troops from South Korea. At the same time, I suggest to your side that we discuss specific measures for the withdrawal of the United States Army."

The U.S. side's chief commissioner, Maddox, unreasonably rejected the suggestions of the Korean and Chinese sides at the meeting, using the excuse that this matter was "unrelated" to the implementation of the armistice agreement.

General Zhu Changjun then pointed out that the Korean and Chinese sides have announced that the Korean and Chinese sides will guarantee the personal safety and freedom of movement of representatives of the South Korean economic community and business people within the military control areas of the Korean and Chinese sides, and the U.S. side should also take the same actions in accordance with the responsibilities given to it by the Armistice Agreement.

General Zhu Changjun also put forward a suggestion to allow journalists from North and South Korea to visit and contact each other.

The U.S. side still refused the suggestions of the Korean and Chinese sides on the grounds that the Military Armistice Commission could not discuss these issues.

General Zhu Changjun said that the issues raised by the Korean and Chinese sides today are the most urgent and pressing issues for the Korean people, but the U.S. side rejected them using unreasonable excuses. He emphasized that in order to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea, the wall between North and South Korea must be torn down, and mutual contact and consultation between the people of North and South Korea must be realized. In order to resolve the Korean issue peacefully at an early date, the U.S. military and all other foreign troops must immediately withdraw from South Korea.

    应该拆除南北朝鲜间的墙壁
    朝中方面建议采取措施实现和平统一朝鲜方案
    美方竟全然无视朝鲜人民迫切要求而一口拒绝
    据新华社平壤3日电　板门店消息：军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将今天在委员会会议上建议军事停战委员会采取相应的措施，使不久前在朝鲜最高人民会议上通过的和平统一朝鲜的方案得以实现。他并且要求美军立即撤出南朝鲜。
    朱昌骏少将建议：根据朝鲜停战协定第七、八、九款的规定，军事停战委员会准许下列人员自由地通过非军事区南北缘和军事分界线，来往于对方军事控制地区。即：为了成立常设委员会讨论举行全朝鲜的自由选举等有关朝鲜和平统一问题的南北朝鲜国会、政府和政党、社会团体的代表以及其他人士；为了成立南北朝鲜经济发展及交流常设委员会，同政治问题无关只为联络和调节南北朝鲜的经济发展和经济交流问题进行协商的南北朝鲜的经济界代表；为了南北朝鲜科学、教育和文化的交流，如互相交换科学成就，互派艺术团体演出，互派体育团体进行比赛以及互相访问、参观、探亲等为其他非军事目的拟来往于对方军事控制地区的人员。
    朱昌骏少将建议，为了便利上述人员来往于南北朝鲜之间，军事停战委员会指定板门店和铁原一带以及双方协议的军事分界线上的其他地区为自由来往地区；双方负责保证上述人员在各自的军事控制地区内的人身安全和移动自由。
    朱昌骏少将强调说：“为了朝鲜的和平统一，为了远东和世界和平，我要求你方根据停战协定的规定，把美国军队和其他一切外国军队立即从南朝鲜撤出，同时我向你方建议讨论撤退美国军队的具体办法。”
    美方首席委员马多克斯在会上以此事同停战协定的实施“无关”为借口，无理拒绝朝中方面的建议。
    朱昌骏少将接着指出，朝中方面已经宣布，朝中方面将保证南朝鲜经济界代表和实业界人士在朝中方面军事控制地区内的人身安全和移动自由，美方也应根据停战协定赋予它的职责，采取同样的行动。
    朱昌骏少将还提出了准许南北朝鲜的记者互相来往和接触的建议。
    美方仍以军事停战委员会不能讨论这些问题为借口拒绝了朝中方面的建议。
    朱昌骏少将说，今天朝中方面提出的问题在朝鲜人民来说是刻不容缓的最紧要、最迫切的问题，但美方却以不合情理的理由作借口加以拒绝。他强调说：为了促进朝鲜的和平统一，必须拆除南北朝鲜之间的墙壁，实现南北朝鲜人民之间的互相接触和协商。为了早日和平解决朝鲜问题，美军等一切外国军队必须立即从南朝鲜撤走。
