Xinhua News Agency, 24th - The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today sent a telegram to the Congolese National Workers' Union, expressing firm support for the Congolese working class and the Congolese people's struggle for national independence and democratic freedom. The telegram reads as follows: To the General Confederation of Equatorial Africa, forwarded to the Congolese National Workers' Union:

	On behalf of the Chinese working class, we express our highest respect and firm support to the Congolese working class and people who are bravely struggling for national independence and democratic freedom. The Chinese working class knows from its own personal experience in the anti-imperialist struggle that imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger that looks powerful but is actually weak. In the current era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, the strength of the world's people is growing, and the colonial system is collapsing, the Congolese people's struggle is by no means isolated. We firmly believe that the Congolese working class and people, with the sympathy and support of the world's working class and people, strengthening unity, and persisting in the struggle, will surely win the final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, 24th - The All-China Youth Federation today sent a telegram to Congolese youth friends through the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, congratulating them on "Congo Day."

	The telegram said: On the occasion of "Congo Day," we would like to express our highest respect on behalf of all Chinese youth to the Congolese people and youth who are heroically struggling for national independence.

	The telegram said: 130 million Chinese youth firmly support the just struggle of the Congolese people and youth, and firmly believe that with the support of socialist countries, Asian and African countries, and justice-loving people all over the world, your struggle for national independence and against colonialism will surely achieve final victory. Any bloody suppression and political deception schemes by the Belgian colonial authorities will be met with shameful failure.

    我总工会和青联电刚果工人和青年
    支持刚果人民争取民族独立
    新华社24日讯　中华全国总工会今天打电报给刚果工人全国联合会，表示坚决支持刚果工人阶级和刚果人民争取民族独立和民主自由的斗争。电文如下：赤道非洲总工会转刚果工人全国联合会：
    我们代表中国工人阶级向为争取民族独立和民主自由而英勇斗争的刚果工人阶级和人民表示崇高的敬意和坚决的支持。中国工人阶级从自己反帝斗争的切身体验中深知帝国主义不过是貌似强大，实际虚弱的纸老虎。在目前东风压倒西风，世界人民力量日益壮大、殖民主义制度正在崩溃的时代，刚果人民的斗争决不是孤立的。我们深信，刚果工人阶级和人民，在全世界工人阶级和人民的同情和支持下，加强团结，坚持斗争，一定能赢得最后胜利。

    新华社24日讯　中华全国青年联合会今天通过亚非人民团结理事会打电报给刚果青年朋友们，祝贺“刚果日”。
    电报说：值此“刚果日”之际，我们谨代表全中国青年向正在为争取民族独立而英勇斗争的刚果人民和青年表示崇高的敬意。
    电报说：一亿三千万中国青年坚决支持刚果人民和青年的正义斗争，并且深信，在社会主义各国和亚非各国人民以及全世界主张正义人民的支持下，你们争取民族独立，反对殖民主义的斗争必将取得最后胜利。比利时殖民当局的任何血腥镇压和政治欺骗阴谋必将遭到可耻的失败。
