Albania's fifteenth anniversary of liberation has arrived. Over the past fifteen years, Albania's social landscape has undergone tremendous changes. These immense changes powerfully demonstrate: this is the victory of Marxism-Leninism, this is the victory of the socialist system, this is the victory of the Albanian people's diligent labor and heroic struggle, and this is the victory of the Albanian Labor Party's correct leadership.

Fifteen years ago, under the leadership of the Albanian Communist Party (now the Labor Party), the Albanian people, after several years of guerrilla warfare, and in the very favorable situation of the Soviet army's decisive victory over Hitler's fascist forces, liberated the entire territory of their country. Since then, the Albanian people have unswervingly embarked on the socialist road, and, under extremely difficult circumstances, have victoriously built their beautiful country at a rapid pace.

Before liberation, Albania, due to long-term occupation and oppression, suffered immensely. Modern industry was almost non-existent, agriculture was quite primitive, there was not a single railway, not a single university, illiteracy accounted for more than 80% of the national population, the people's lives were very poor, medical and health facilities were extremely lacking, and during the war, it suffered severe destruction from Italian and German fascists. After victory, its geographical location was not even adjacent to the socialist camp countries. This was the scene that faced the Albanian people at the beginning of liberation. However, the liberated Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, and with the comprehensive and strong assistance of socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union, while resolutely fighting domestic and foreign enemies, worked diligently and, through a series of social reforms and economic recovery work, as well as the implementation of planned economic construction, not only quickly healed the wounds of war, but also quickly and comprehensively developed the national economy. By the end of 1958, the total industrial output value had increased by 17.8 times compared to 1938. Among them, the mining volume of chromium ore increased by 27.7 times, reaching 200,000 tons; copper ore increased by 10.7 times, reaching 87,000 tons; oil increased by 2.7 times, reaching 400,000 tons; coal increased by 70 times, reaching 255,000 tons; natural asphalt increased by 1.34 times, reaching 32,000 tons; electricity increased by 16 times, reaching 150 million kilowatt-hours; cement increased by 7.5 times, reaching 77,000 tons; and cotton cloth increased by 61 times, reaching 22.26 million meters. In addition, new sectors such as sugar refining, oil refining, and nickel-iron ore, which did not exist in the past, were also built. The total industrial output value in half a month in 1958 was equal to the total output value of the entire year of 1938. Calculated per capita, the output of many industrial products already exceeded neighboring countries in 1957, such as electricity exceeding Turkey by 18%, coal exceeding Italy by 4.5 times, oil exceeding Yugoslavia by 13 times, cotton cloth exceeding Greece by 25%, and chromium ore mining exceeding all neighboring countries and ranking sixth in the world in absolute output.

Agriculture has also developed on the road to collectivization. To date, 81.9% of the country's cultivated land area has been collectivized, and cooperative farmers account for 70% of the country's farmers. Agricultural mechanization has achieved great success. Currently, the mechanized farming area of cash crops reaches 70% to 80%, and the mechanized farming area of other crops reaches more than 60%. Due to vigorous soil improvement and land reclamation work, the cultivated land area in 1958 increased by 96% compared to 1938. Animal husbandry and horticulture have also developed. Currently, it has not only greatly changed the past situation of large-scale grain shortages every year, but also exports a portion of cash crops in addition to meeting its own needs.

The development of transportation is also unprecedented. After liberation, the first railway in history was built. The road freight volume, which bears the main transportation task of Albania, will increase by 81 times this year compared to 1938. Maritime freight volume will increase by 12 times. Now, Albania has regular flights to and from five countries including the Soviet Union and Hungary.

With the advancing pace of economic construction, brilliant achievements have also been made on the socialist cultural front. As early as 1955, illiteracy among people under the age of 40 had been eliminated. School-age children have all been enrolled, and seven-year compulsory education is being rapidly popularized. In this country with a population of 1.5 million, in the 1959-1960 academic year, the number of students at all levels of schools has reached 260,000 (including more than 26,000 night school and correspondence students), which is 3.7 times more than in 1938. Calculated per capita, it exceeds all its neighboring countries. In these fifteen years, Albania established universities for the first time. Calculated per capita, there are now 27 university students (including night school and correspondence students) for every 10,000 people. Other undertakings such as science, literature and art, publishing, and sports have all achieved unprecedented prosperity.

The rapid progress of the national economy has brought tremendous changes to the material living conditions of the Albanian people. The national income in 1958 increased by more than 2.5 times compared to 1938. The real wages of workers increased by 43% compared to 1950, and the income of farmers increased by 39%. Between 1950 and 1958, prices were lowered eight times, and the people benefited from this by 7 billion leks (Albanian currency). In the autumn of 1957, Albania completely abolished the rationing system two years ahead of schedule. Employees enjoy social insurance and paid leave of half a month each year, and the people across the country enjoy free medical care. By the end of 1958, medical institutions and beds had increased by 11 times and 7 times respectively compared to 1938.

The implementation of the national economic annual plan this year is better than last year, and starting from this year, cadres across the country will participate in one month of physical labor each year. Many central leaders, government ministers, and district party committee secretaries and executive committee chairmen are taking the lead in planting experimental fields, promoting experience, and guiding production. This summer, a nationwide mineral exploration campaign was also launched. By the third quarter of this year, the targets for many major production projects have been completed or overfulfilled on schedule.

In recent years, people have used "garden" and "pearl" to describe Albania's prospects, and the third five-year plan currently being drafted will be an important step in realizing the above-mentioned prospects. During 1961-1965, in addition to further expanding existing industries with new hydropower stations, factories, etc., Albania will also build new industrial sectors such as chemical and metallurgical industries, further develop agricultural production and achieve more extensive agricultural mechanization, and large areas of mountain slopes and valleys will be covered with colorful flowers, fruit trees, and the consumption of meat and milk by the people will increase by nearly double compared to now. When the third five-year plan is completed, Albania will transform from the current agricultural-industrial country into an industrial-agricultural country.

All of this eloquently shows that the socialist system not only enables the people to fully enjoy freedom and political rights, but also is the most reliable social system for continuously improving the people's welfare and cultural level. The example of Albania's changing historical landscape more vividly illustrates that regardless of the size of the country and the original level of economic and cultural development, as long as the people seize power, control their own destiny, and under the leadership of the working-class party, they will create miracles of national happiness.

While achieving brilliant achievements in domestic construction, Albania's international status has also been unprecedentedly enhanced. The past powerlessness of small countries in the international arena has become a thing of the past. Today, a completely independent and autonomous new Albania, together with the countries of the socialist camp, consistently pursues a peaceful foreign policy and makes valuable contributions to the cause of international peace, friendship, and cooperation with its unremitting efforts. The People's Republic of Albania actively supports the struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to maintain peace, strive for national independence, and democratic freedom, resolutely opposes the aggressive and war policies of US imperialism, and makes unremitting efforts to maintain peace and security in the Balkan region. The Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people have consistently been loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism and have made significant contributions to consolidating the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement, defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and opposing the modern revisionists represented by the ruling group of Yugoslavia. Over the past fifteen years, the achievements made by the Albanian people under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha have been enormous. Our Chinese people have always regarded the achievements of the Albanian people as our own and feel happy and encouraged.

The friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people is deep, unbreakable, and based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. With the continuous and rapid advancement of socialist construction in both countries, the friendly, mutual assistance, and cooperative relations between the two countries will inevitably develop day by day, thereby strengthening the unity between the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, safeguarding world peace, and promoting the development of the cause of human progress.

    阿尔巴尼亚光辉的十五年
    中华人民共和国驻阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国大使　罗士高
    阿尔巴尼亚解放十五周年了。十五年来，阿尔巴尼亚的社会面貌起了十分巨大的变化。这种巨大的变化有力地表明了：这是马克思列宁主义的胜利，这是社会主义制度的胜利，这是阿尔巴尼亚人民勤奋劳动、英勇斗争的胜利，这是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党正确领导的胜利。
    十五年前，阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚共产党（现改为劳动党）的领导下，经过几年的游击战争，在苏军对希特勒法西斯军队取得决定性胜利的十分有利形势下，解放了自己全国的领土。从此，阿尔巴尼亚人民坚定不移地走上了社会主义道路，在异常困难的情况下，胜利地以快速的步伐建设着自己美好的国家。
    解放前的阿尔巴尼亚，由于长期被占领受压榨，苦难是十分深重的。现代工业几乎没有，农业相当原始，没有一条铁路，没有一所高等学校，文盲占全国人口80％以上，人民生活非常贫困，医疗卫生设施极缺，在战时更遭到意大利和德国法西斯的严重破坏，胜利后它的地理位置也没有与社会主义阵营各国相接壤，这就是解放之初摆在阿尔巴尼亚人民面前的景象。然而解放了的阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，在社会主义各国特别是苏联全面的、大力的帮助下，一面与国内外敌人进行坚决斗争，一面辛勤劳动，经过一系列的社会改革和经济恢复工作以及实行计划经济建设，不但很快地治好了战争创伤，而且很快地全面发展了国民经济。到1958年底，工业总产值比1938年增长了十七点八倍。其中铬矿石开采量增长了二十七点七倍，达二十万吨；铜矿砂增长了十点七倍，达八万七千吨；石油增长了二点七倍，达四十万吨；煤增长了七十倍，达二十五万五千吨；天然沥青增长了一点三四倍，达三万二千吨；电力增长了十六倍，达一亿五千万度；水泥增长了七点五倍，达七万七千吨；棉布增长了六十一倍，达二千二百二十六万米。此外还新建了过去根本没有的制糖、炼油、镍铁矿等部门。1958年半个月的工业生产总值就等于1938年全年的总和。如果按人口平均计算，许多工业产品的产量还在1957年就已超过了邻国，如电力超过土耳其18％，煤超过意大利四倍半，石油超过南斯拉夫十三倍，棉布超过希腊25％，铬矿开采量超过了所有邻国并在绝对产量上占世界第六位。
    农业在合作化的道路上也获得了发展。到目前为止，全国已有81.9％的耕地面积合作化，合作农户占全国农户的70％。农业机械化取得了巨大的成就，目前经济作物的机耕面积达70％到80％，其他作物机耕面积达60％以上。由于大力进行了土壤改良和垦荒工作，1958年的耕地面积比1938年增加了96％。畜牧业和园艺业均有发展。目前不但已大大改变了过去每年大量缺粮的状况，而且经济作物的产量除供自己所需外，还有一部分出口。
    交通运输业的发展也是空前的。解放后建筑了历史上第一条铁路。担负着阿尔巴尼亚主要运输任务的公路货运量，今年将比1938年增长八十一倍。海上货运量将增长十二倍。现在，阿尔巴尼亚同苏、匈等五个国家有定期的班机通航。
    随着经济建设的前进步伐，社会主义文化战线上也取得了辉煌的成就。早在1955年，四十岁以下的文盲已经扫除了。学龄儿童都已入学，七年制义务教育正在迅速地普及。在这个拥有一百五十万人口的国家里，1959—1960年的学年中，各级学校学生数已达到二十六万人（其中包括两万六千多名夜校和函授学生），比1938年多三点七倍。按人口平均计算，超过了它的所有邻国。在这十五年中，阿尔巴尼亚第一次建立了高等学校。按人口平均计算，现在每一万人当中就有二十七名大学生（包括夜校和函授生）。其他如科学、文艺、出版、体育等事业都得到今非昔比的繁荣。
    国民经济的突飞猛进，给阿尔巴尼亚人民的物质生活状况带来了巨大的变化。1958年的国民收入比1938年增长了两倍半以上。工人实际工资比1950年增加了43％，农民收入增加了39％。在1950—1958年间，降低了八次物价，人民从中获益达七十亿里克（阿币）。1957年秋季，阿尔巴尼亚提前两年全部取消了配给制。职工都享受着社会保险，每年并有半个月工资照发的休假，全国人民都享有免费医疗。至1958年底，医疗机构和床位分别比1938年增长了十一倍和七倍。
    今年执行国民经济年度计划的情况较去年更好，而且从今年起，全国实行干部每年参加一个月的体力劳动。许多中央领导人、政府部长、各区党委书记和执行委员会主席都以身作则地种试验田，推广经验，指导生产。今年夏季还发动了一个全民性的找矿运动。今年到第三季度止，许多主要生产项目的指标都已按时完成或超额完成了。
    近年来，人们都用“花园”、“明珠”来形容阿尔巴尼亚的远景，正在拟订中的第三个五年计划将是实现上述远景的重要步骤。在1961—1965年间，阿尔巴尼亚除要进一步用新的水电站、工厂等来扩大现有的工业以外，还将兴建起化学、冶金等新的工业部门，将进一步发展农业生产和更广泛地实现农业机械化，大片的山坡谷地将要复盖起万紫千红的花果树木，人民对于肉和奶的消费量将比现在增长近一倍。当第三个五年计划完成时，阿尔巴尼亚将从现在的农业—工业国变为工业—农业国。
  所有这些都雄辩地说明了，社会主义制度不仅使人民充分享受到自由和政治权利，而且是不断提高人民福利和文化水平的最可靠的社会制度。阿尔巴尼亚改变历史面貌的事例更生动地说明了：不管国家大小和原来的经济文化水平高低，只要人民取得了政权，掌握了自己的命运，在工人阶级政党领导下，就会做出全民幸福的奇迹来。
    在国内建设取得辉煌成就的同时，阿尔巴尼亚的国际地位也空前提高。过去小国在国际上的无权地位已成过去。今天，一个完全独立自主的新阿尔巴尼亚，同社会主义阵营各国一起，一贯执行和平的外交政策，以自己的不懈努力，对国际和平友好合作事业作出了宝贵的贡献。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国积极支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民维护和平、争取民族独立和民主自由的斗争，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，并且为维护巴尔干地区的和平和安全，作了不懈的努力。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民一贯忠于无产阶级国际主义的原则，在巩固社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结、捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性和反对以南斯拉夫统治集团为代表的现代修正主义者的斗争中，作出了重大贡献。十五年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，取得的成就是十分巨大的。我们中国人民一向把阿尔巴尼亚人民的成就当作自己的成就一样，感到欢欣和鼓舞。
    中阿两国人民的友谊是深厚的，是牢不可破的，是以马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义为基础的。随着两国社会主义建设的不断快速前进，两国之间的友好互助合作必将日益发展，从而为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国之间的团结、维护世界和平和促进人类进步事业的发展，必将作出新的更大的贡献。（附图片）
