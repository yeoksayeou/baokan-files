Comrades,

Our conference has been very good and very successful. Thanks to the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and thanks to the joint efforts of all the delegates and the relevant departments of the Central Committee and all the working comrades, this conference has now successfully completed its tasks and is about to come to a satisfactory conclusion.

During this conference, we heard Comrade Zhu De's congratulatory speech on behalf of the Party Central Committee, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the current economic situation and tasks, and the speeches of many leading comrades of the Party and the state. All these instructions and reports gave great enlightenment and encouragement to all our delegates, enabling us to further recognize the current excellent situation, clarify the specific tasks for the future, improve our thinking, and strengthen our confidence. We must resolutely implement the spirit of these instructions and reports in our future practical work.

At this conference, many delegates made very good speeches, reporting to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on the brilliant achievements in production, construction, work, and study, and proactively introducing the advanced deeds of their regions, units, and individuals. These speeches, with eloquent facts, fully proved the complete correctness of the Party's General Line and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, fully proved the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward, and fully proved that the realization of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward is the strong desire and urgent requirement of the working class. These speeches fully reflected the noble communist qualities of the Chinese working class, reflected the firm revolutionary will of the Chinese working class and their boundless drive for the cause of socialist construction, and reflected the flesh-and-blood ties between the Chinese working class and the Party. These speeches also powerfully refuted the various slanders and fallacies of the right-leaning opportunists with irrefutable facts. Through these speeches, the comrades attending the meeting received an extremely vivid and profound education on the General Line.

At the medium-sized meetings held by industry, the representatives listened to the reports of the responsible comrades of the relevant departments, summarized and exchanged the rich experiences of various industries since the Great Leap Forward, and disseminated and learned advanced ideas and advanced experiences more deeply through professional group discussions, on-site performances, and visits. The conference achieved the goal of being both theoretical and practical, both giving treasures and learning from others' experiences. During the conference, many delegates also wrote letters and made phone calls back, giving great encouragement to comrades outside the meeting and further promoting production. At the same time, good news continued to come from outside the meeting, making the conference even more enthusiastic. This method of holding meetings with "combining the top and bottom, combining the left and right, and combining the inside and outside" made the conference better and better, and the representatives' enthusiasm was even more full, which foreshadows our greater victory in marching towards new goals.

At this conference, the Party Central Committee issued a great battle call to us. It required us to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in about ten years; at the same time, it required us to realize agricultural technical transformation as soon as possible, so that agriculture can gradually realize mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification. The Party pointed out to us that agriculture is the foundation of national economic development. With the leap forward in agriculture, there will be a leap forward in the entire national economy. We must combine the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture, and implement the policy of developing industry and developing agriculture simultaneously. Vigorously supporting agriculture and arming agriculture with strong modern technology is a arduous and glorious task for the Chinese working class. To achieve this great task, we have all the necessary conditions, the most important of which is that we have the wise leadership of the long-tested and mature Marxist-Leninist Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. As long as we hold high the red flag of the Party's General Line under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, adhere to putting politics in command, and adhere to the mass movement, we will be invincible, and we will definitely be able to complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party.

Our current urgent task is to seize the remaining month or so before the end of the year, strive to complete and over fulfill this year's national economic plan ahead of schedule, and earnestly prepare for next year's production, and strive for a good start, monthly red, and overall red in the first quarter of next year, and realize a better and more comprehensive leap forward next year. In order to achieve this goal, we must further implement the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, continue to oppose right-leaning, boost morale, and carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy more widely and deeply; we must greatly promote the communist style, strengthen collaboration, learn from each other and help each other; we must combine practical work, hard work, and skillful work, vigorously carry out the technical revolution and cultural revolution, so that production can continue to leap forward.

The delegates who attended the meeting will soon return to their original work posts. After returning, we should publicize the spirit of this conference to the broad masses, disseminate the advanced ideas and advanced experiences introduced at the conference, and quickly plunge into the tense production battle with practical actions. We must firmly remember the Party's teachings, "not only should we not be arrogant or impetuous, learn modestly, and strive to keep our units and ourselves advanced, but also promote the communist style and help other units and people catch up with the advanced level." I believe that the delegates who attended the meeting will definitely be able to respond to the Party's call, better play

    一定完成党交给我们的任务
    曾山在群英大会上致闭幕词同志们：
    我们这次大会开得很好，很成功。这次大会，由于党中央和国务院的直接领导，由于全体代表和中央有关部门及所有工作同志的共同努力，现在已经胜利地完成了自己的任务，就要圆满地结束了。
    这次大会期间，我们听到了朱德同志代表党中央所致的祝词，听到了李富春副总理关于目前的经济形势和任务的报告，还听到了党和国家许多领导同志的讲话，所有这些指示和报告，给予了我们全体代表同志极大的启示和鼓舞，使我们进一步认清了当前的大好形势，明确了今后的具体任务，提高了思想，增强了信心。我们一定要把这些指示和报告的精神坚决贯彻到今后的实际工作当中去。
    在这次大会上，许多代表同志都作了很好的发言，向党中央和毛主席汇报了生产上、建设上、工作上、学习上的辉煌成就，主动地介绍了本地区、本单位和本人的先进事迹。这些发言，以雄辩的事实，充分证明了党的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针的完全正确，充分证明了大跃进的伟大成就，充分证明了实现总路线、大跃进是工人阶级的强烈愿望和迫切要求。这些发言充分地反映了我国工人阶级的共产主义的高贵品质，反映了我国工人阶级坚定的革命意志和对社会主义建设事业的无比的干劲，反映了我国工人阶级与党的血肉联系。这些发言，也以无可置辩的事实，有力地驳斥了右倾机会主义者的种种污蔑和谬论。通过这些发言，使到会的同志受到了一次极为生动和深刻的总路线教育。
    在按产业召开的中型会议上，代表们听取了各有关部门负责同志的报告，总结交流了大跃进以来各行各业的丰富经验，并通过专业小组座谈讨论和现场表演、参观等方式，更深入地传播和学习了先进思想和先进经验。使大会达到了既务虚，又务实，既送宝，又取经的目的。在大会期间，许多代表还写了信和打电话回去，给予会外同志很大的鼓舞，进一步推动了生产，同时会外的捷报不断传来，又使大会开得更加热烈。这种“上下结合，左右结合，内外结合”的开会方法，使大会愈开愈好，代表们的干劲也越鼓越足，它预示着我们向新的目标进军的更大胜利。
    在这次大会上，党中央向我们发出了伟大的战斗号召。要求我们在十年左右的时间内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国；同时要求我们尽快地实现农业技术改造，使农业逐步实现机械化、水利化、化学化和电气化。党向我们指出，农业是国民经济发展的基础。有了农业的跃进，就会有整个国民经济的跃进。我们必须把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业结合起来，贯彻执行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针。大力支援农业，以强大的现代技术武装农业，这是我国工人阶级艰巨而光荣的任务。为了实现这个伟大的任务，我们有着一切所需要的条件，其中最主要的一条是，我们有了以毛泽东同志为首的久经考验的成熟的马列主义的党中央的英明领导。只要我们在党中央和毛主席领导下，高举党的总路线的红旗，坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众运动，我们就会无往而不胜，我们就一定能够完成党交给我们的任务。
    我们当前的迫切的任务，就是要抓紧年底以前的一个多月时间，争取实现提前完成和超额完成今年的国民经济计划，切实作好明年的生产准备工作，争取明年第一季度开门红、月月红、满堂红，实现明年更好更全面的跃进。为了达到这个目的，我们必须进一步贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，继续反右倾，鼓干劲，更广泛深入地开展增产节约竞赛；我们必须大大发扬共产主义风格，加强协作，互学互帮；我们必须把实干、苦干和巧干结合起来，大力开展技术革命和文化革命，使生产持续不断地跃进。
    到会的代表同志们很快就要回到原来的工作岗位上去了。回去以后，我们应该向广大群众宣传这次大会的精神，传播大会上所介绍的先进思想和先进经验，并且要以实际行动迅速投入紧张的生产战斗中去。我们要牢牢记住党的教导，“不仅要不骄不躁，虚心学习，努力使自己的单位和自己保持先进的称号，而且要发扬共产主义的风格，帮助别的单位和别人赶上先进的水平。”我相信，到会的代表同志们一定能够响应党的号召，更好地发挥带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用，团结千百万群众，为实现党所提出的远大目标——把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家而英勇奋斗！
    现在，我宣布大会胜利闭幕了！
    祝同志们在工作中取得新的胜利！祝我国社会主义建设事业不断地向前跃进，再跃进！
