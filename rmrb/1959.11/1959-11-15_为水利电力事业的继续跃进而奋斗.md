    Strive for the Continued Leap Forward of Water Conservancy and Electric Power
    Liu Lanbo, Vice Minister of Water Conservancy and Electric Power

    Currently, the domestic situation is very good, and the situation in water conservancy and electric power construction is also very good. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the great call to oppose right-leaning, encourage greater effort, and launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy, a magnificent and vigorous new production upsurge was quickly set off across the country. The vast number of workers on the national water conservancy and electric power front are full of energy and high morale. Whether in power production or water conservancy and electric power construction, a new situation of daily and monthly increases and rapid progress has emerged. In terms of water conservancy construction, the nationwide prelude to large-scale water conservancy projects has begun. Currently, 30 million people have been invested in water conservancy, and the momentum is great. In terms of power production, it has increased by 27.5% in the seventy days since August. In terms of power station construction, the installed capacity in September alone exceeded the total installed capacity in the first half of the year. From January to September, the national power generation has exceeded the total power generation of the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. This production upsurge is not only fierce and developing rapidly, but also has new characteristics of rapid speed, high quality, low cost, and good safety for an all-round leap forward. The original "routine" of being relaxed at the beginning of the month and tight at the end has been broken. The mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy is more closely combined with improving enterprise management and vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution. Under this new situation, it seems that not only can this year's task be completed ahead of schedule, but it can also be exceeded.

    However, it should also be seen that due to the sustained high tide of the entire industrial and agricultural production increase and economy campaign, although water conservancy and electric power have developed rapidly, they still cannot fully meet the needs of the continued leap forward of the national economy. In order to ensure the electricity needs of the national economy's continuous leap forward and to ensure a greater agricultural harvest, we must, on the basis of past victories, muster greater efforts, fight hard in the fourth quarter, successfully complete this year's water conservancy and electric power tasks, and make preparations from all aspects for a continued leap forward next year.

    In order to accomplish this task, there is much work we must do and many measures we need to take. In terms of capital construction, while grasping progress, we must earnestly pay attention to project quality and ensure that new equipment is smoothly and safely put into production. In terms of production, we must continue to tap production potential, ensure safe operation, strive to generate more electricity and supply more electricity, and actively carry out the mass power generation movement. This work is very important and must be conscientiously implemented. What I want to especially mention here is:

    First of all, we must thoroughly oppose right-leaning and muster our energy to continuously leap forward and victoriously complete the tasks of water conservancy and electric power construction. Before the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, due to the mischief of right-leaning opportunists, some slackening phenomena appeared in both production and construction. But since opposing right-leaning and encouraging greater effort, an unprecedented production upsurge has emerged. Many projects that were originally considered impossible to complete have been completed ahead of schedule, and many things that were originally considered impossible have been done. Production has risen steadily, and construction speed has leaped forward rapidly. Under this great call of the Party, we must always maintain vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm, strive for advancement, and advance endlessly.

    Secondly, adhere to putting politics in command and vigorously carry out the mass movement. The "three main" policy of focusing on water storage, small-scale projects, and mass self-reliance in China's water conservancy construction is a concrete manifestation of the Party's mass line in water conservancy work. Relying on this policy, our water conservancy construction has achieved unprecedented achievements. Countless facts since the Great Leap Forward have proven that wherever we adhere to putting politics in command and the mass movement is carried out well and thoroughly, we can achieve results that others cannot. The advanced examples created by the advanced representatives of the Fushun Power Plant, Anshan Power Supply Bureau, and many construction sites, workshops, and teams attending this National Hero Conference further powerfully illustrate this issue.

    Thirdly, promote the communist style and foster the spirit of cooperation. In terms of water conservancy construction, the management of a river and the construction of a reservoir involve the upstream and downstream, the left and right banks, and many aspects such as shipping and transportation. Only by breaking down the various boundaries between regions, projects, urban and rural areas, and various departments, supporting each other, and sharing what we have, can we smoothly complete the task. In terms of power construction, the construction of a power plant and a line also requires the cooperation of many enterprise departments to better complete the task. The reason why the Wujing Thermal Power Plant project could be completed in about six months, shortening the construction period by 80%, is because seventeen industrial units vigorously supported it under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee. In terms of power production, as everyone knows, great achievements have been made in recent years in adjusting load, saving electricity, and distributing power. However, without the support of various enterprises, it would never have been possible.

    This spirit of cooperation must be greatly promoted, and this communist style must be continuously promoted and developed in future work.

    Fourthly, widely and deeply carry out the advanced producer movement and the socialist labor competition. Through this Hero Conference, a new upsurge of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced should be further set off in the water conservancy and electric power system; the advanced experience brought by the representatives should be systematically, organized, and earnestly promoted; through the promotion of these advanced experiences and the deep development of the advanced producer movement, everyone can reach the level of advanced producers, thereby greatly accelerating the development of water conservancy and electric power.

    In carrying out labor competition, we must focus on the central tasks of each period, with clear goals and concrete measures. Each workshop, each construction site, and each team must have concrete measures and methods to complete the annual, monthly, ten-day, and daily plans. In the competition, we must advocate combining hard work, practical work, and skillful work, so that everyone can become a technical innovation expert. In terms of competition methods and experience exchange, we must advocate a variety of forms; we must learn from each other, help each other, and improve together.

    Now there is only more than a month left until the end of the year. This is the final decisive stage for completing this year's task. We must thoroughly oppose right-leaning, muster our energy, and complete and overfulfill this year's national plan ahead of schedule, and complete the main indicators of the second five-year plan ahead of schedule.

    为水利电力事业的继续跃进而奋斗
    水利电力部副部长  刘澜波
    当前，国内形势好得很，水利电力建设的形势也好得很。党的八届八中全会提出反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动的伟大号召后，在全国迅速地掀起了一个波澜壮阔、气势磅礴的新的生产高潮。全国水利电力战线上的广大职工干劲冲天，斗志昂扬，不论在电力生产或水利电力建设方面，都出现了日日上升、月月上升、突飞猛进的新形势。在水利建设方面，全国大修水利的序幕已经揭开，目前投入水利方面的人力已有三千万人，劲头很大。在电力生产方面，8月以来七十天内上升了27.5％；在电站建设方面，9月份一个月内比上半年装机容量的总和还多。1至9月份，全国发电量已经超过了大跃进的1958年的全年的发电量。这个生产高潮，不仅来势猛，发展快，并且具有速度快、质量高、成本低、安全好全面跃进的新特点。原来月初松、月末紧的“常规”，已经被打破；增产节约的群众运动同改进企业的经营管理、大搞技术革新和技术革命更加密切地结合起来了。在这个新形势下，提前完成今年的任务，看样子不仅能够完成，并且可以超过。
    但是也应该看到，由于整个工农业增产节约运动的持续高潮，水利电力事业虽然发展很快，还不能完全满足国民经济继续跃进的需要。为了保证国民经济不断跃进的用电需要，保证农业的更大丰收，我们必须在以往胜利的基础上，鼓足更大干劲，大战第四季度，出色地完成今年的水利电力任务，并且从各方面做好明年继续跃进的准备工作。
    为了完成这一任务，我们要做的工作和需要采取的措施很多，在基本建设方面，要求在抓进度的同时，切实注意工程质量，保证新设备顺利地、安全地投入生产；在生产方面，要继续发挥生产潜力，保证安全运行，力争多发电、多供电，积极地开展群众办电运动。这些工作都很重要，必须认真贯彻执行。这里，特别要提到的是：
    首先，必须把右倾反透，把干劲鼓足，才能不断地跃进，胜利地完成水利电力建设任务。党的八届八中全会以前，由于右倾机会主义分子作怪，不论生产和建设上都出现了某些松劲现象。但是自从反右倾、鼓干劲以后，就出现了前所未有的生产高潮，许多原来认为不能完成的工程也提前完成了，许多原来认为办不到的事情也办到了，生产节节上升，建设速度突飞猛进。我们要在党的这个伟大号召下，时刻保持旺盛的革命干劲，力争上游，永无止境地前进。
    其次，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。我国水利建设上的以蓄水为主、小型为主、群众自办为主的“三主”方针，正是党的群众路线在水利工作中的具体表现。依靠了这个方针，我们的水利建设才取得了亘古未有的巨大成就。大跃进以来的无数事实证明，哪个地方坚持了政治挂帅，群众运动搞得好，搞得深透，哪里就能干出别人所不能干出的成绩来。出席这次全国群英大会的抚顺发电厂、鞍山供电局，以及许多工地、车间、班组的先进代表所创造的先进事例，更是有力地说明了这个问题。
    第三，发扬共产主义风格，大兴协作之风。在水利建设方面，一条河流的治理，一个水库的修筑，都牵掣到上下游、左右岸，牵掣到航运、交通等许多方面，只有打破地区之间、工程之间、城乡之间、各部门之间的各种界限，互相支援、互通有无，才能顺利地完成任务。在电力建设方面，一个电厂、一条线路的建设，也需要许多企业部门的配合，才能更好地完成任务。吴泾热电厂工程所以能在六个月左右建成，工期缩短了80％，就是因为在上海市委领导下，十七个工业单位大力支援的结果。在电力生产方面，大家知道，几年来，在调整负荷、节约用电、电力分配等方面都取得了很大的成绩。但是，如果没有各个企业的支持，是决不会作到的。
    这种协作之风必须大大提倡，这种共产主义风格在今后的工作中要不断地发扬光大。
    第四，广泛深入地开展先进生产者运动和社会主义劳动竞赛。通过这次群英大会，在水利电力系统中，要进一步掀起一个学先进、比先进、赶先进的热潮；要有计划、有组织地、认真地推广各位代表带来的先进经验；通过这些先进经验的推广和先进生产者运动的深入开展，使大家都能达到先进生产者的水平，从而大大地加速水利电力事业的发展。
    在开展劳动竞赛方面，要围绕各个时期的中心任务，目标明确，措施具体，每个车间、每个工地、每个班组都要有完成年度、月度、每旬、每日的计划的具体措施和方法。在竞赛中，要提倡苦干、实干、巧干相结合，使每一个人都成为技术革新能手。在竞赛方法上和经验交流上，要提倡多种多样的形式；要互相学习、互相帮助，共同提高。
    现在离年底只有一个多月的时间了，这是完成今年任务的最后决胜阶段，我们要把右倾反透，把干劲鼓足，提前完成和超额完成今年的国家计划，提前完成第二个五年计划的主要指标。
