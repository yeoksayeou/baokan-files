Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 21st: The Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge has been fully completed. The relevant authorities recently conducted an inspection and deemed the engineering quality to be excellent, deciding to put it into use ahead of schedule. Currently, engineering trains are already running on the bridge.

The Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge is the second bridge spanning the mighty Yangtze River after the completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. It is 820 meters long and is a double-track railway bridge. This bridge connects the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to the north and the soon-to-be-completed Sichuan-Guizhou Railway to the south. After the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway and this bridge are officially opened to traffic, Chongqing will become a hub connecting the Sichuan-Guizhou and Chengdu-Chongqing Railways. In the past, the great river blocked trains traveling from north to south, and the ores, coal, iron, and various means of production and daily necessities traveling north all relied on manpower and wooden boats for transportation, taking several days to transport them to the other side. After the bridge is opened, it will take less than a minute to transport large quantities of materials to the other side. It will play a huge role in accelerating the exchange of materials in the Southwest and Northwest regions and promoting economic prosperity.

The construction of the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge began on September 10, 1958. Its completion date was ten months ahead of the original plan. From the beginning of construction, the Party Committee of the Fourth Bridge Engineering Division of the Railway Ministry's Bridge Bureau insisted on educating employees with the spirit of the General Line, and explained the importance of speeding up the project and attaching importance to quality through large classes, exhibitions, and other forms, so that all employees could first firmly establish a comprehensive view of achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results in their thinking. During the construction process, socialist labor competitions were launched between teams and work shifts, and evaluations were carried out daily, every ten days, and monthly, thereby ensuring high speed, high quality, and safety.

    横跨滔滔长江，连接成渝川黔两条铁路
    重庆长江大桥建成
    桥长八百二十米，工程质量优良，提前交付使用
    新华社重庆21日电　重庆长江大桥已经全部建成。主管部门最近进行了验收，认为工程质量优良，决定提前交付使用。目前这座大桥已经通行工程列车。
    重庆长江大桥是继武汉长江大桥建成之后，横跨滔滔长江的第二座大桥。它全长八百二十米，是一座双线铁路桥。这座桥北接成渝铁路，南接即将建成的川黔铁路；川黔铁路和这座大桥正式通车以后，重庆就将成为川黔和成渝两条铁路连接的枢纽。过去，大江把南来北往的火车阻住了，南来的矿石、煤、铁和北去的各种生产资料、生活资料全靠人力和木船运输，辗转好几天才能运到对岸；大桥通车以后，用不到一分钟就可以把大量的物资运到对岸去。它对加速西南、西北地区的物资交流和促进经济的繁荣，将起巨大的作用。
    重庆长江大桥是1958年9月10日动工修建的。它的完工期比原订计划提前了十个月。施工一开始，铁道部大桥局第四桥梁工程处党委，就坚持以总路线的精神教育职工，并且通过上大课、展览会等形式，说明加快工程速度和重视质量的重要性，使全体职工首先从思想上牢固地树立起多快好省的全面观点。在施工过程中，队与队、工班与工班，展开了社会主义劳动竞赛，并按日按旬按月进行评比，从而保证了高速、优质和安全。（附图片）
