    Technical Innovation Combined with Chain Competition to Jointly Promote Rapid Completion of Products
    Taiyuan City and Beijing Xingping Machinery Factory Create Good Experiences
    (Our report) The "Chain War" competition currently widely underway in industrial and mining enterprises and basic construction departments in Taiyuan City has effectively changed the state of imbalance in production and promoted faster product completion.
    The "Chain War" competition and the opponent competition are the main forms of labor competition in Taiyuan's industrial and basic construction sectors, with approximately 90% of workers participating in this type of competition. As early as July of this year, Taiyuan formed a broad opponent competition where each trade had its model workers and each type of work had its model workers. According to statistics from fifty-six industrial and basic construction units alone, fifty-one workshop and department model entities, four hundred and forty-two team model entities, and nine hundred and sixty-five individual model workers were established. Around the model workers, three hundred and sixty advanced workshops, two hundred and fifty-five advanced work sections, more than three thousand eight hundred advanced groups, and more than sixty-two thousand advanced producers emerged.
    Although the opponent competition has opened up a vast space for mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and giving play to their pioneering spirit, it cannot completely solve the problem of high-level collaboration. The differences between advanced and backward elements of departments, types of work, groups, work sections, and even workshops still affect the overall improvement of the production level, and some enterprises often exceed their monthly output value plans, but products are often not assembled into complete sets. Therefore, it is very necessary to take the enterprise's overall tasks and key products as clear combat goals and transform the development of collaboration and organization of balance into the conscious actions of the broad masses of workers. This task was solved by the newly emerging "Chain War" competition.
    The "Chain War" competition form takes a product or a type of work as the center, attracting relevant groups, work sections, workshops, departments, and brother units in a front-line to front-line, front-line to rear, internal and external large-scale collaborative competition. It has three main battle lines, namely: large product chains, large production front-line and technical rear chains, and large production and life chains. There are many small chains on each battle line, with large and small chains crisscrossing, forming a collaborative whole of interlocking rings in a production unit. This competition mobilized not only the workers but also the technical personnel and cadres, not only the factory but also promoted the production of brother factories. It has played a huge role in changing the imbalance in all aspects of production and ensuring common improvement. The result of the large-scale "Chain War" competition on the industrial and basic construction fronts in Taiyuan City is that the situation of product completion has changed greatly; it has also promoted the participation of the broad masses of workers in the technical and administrative management of enterprises. The Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory revised and improved 234 types of various systems during the competition, revised more than 450 process regulations and technical conditions, also revised 480 drawings, enriched and reorganized more than 60 items of process equipment, thus establishing a new management order.
    (Our report) The Beijing Xingping Machinery Factory launched a one-dragon large-scale collaborative competition centered on technical innovation, constantly organizing new balances on the basis of advancement, and realizing production that is both advanced and balanced in sets.
    The main products produced by the Xingping Machinery Factory in the second half of this year were all large-scale new products, and there were many difficulties in terms of equipment and technical conditions. After studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all the factory's employees launched a new upsurge in production. The Zhang Deyuan boring group in the Second Workshop first implemented three technical measures, reducing the time to bore a pump body from 27 hours to about 6 hours. The entire group increased production from processing one pump body per day to more than three. As the boring group took a leap forward, the Wang Lu planing group in the upstream process and the Ma Yunpeng fitter group in the downstream process suddenly became nervous; one could not supply planing parts in time, and the other could not grind and drill holes in time. The general branch of the Party in the workshop immediately seized these two weak links and mobilized the workers to do everything possible to make technical innovations. After hard work, the Ma Yunpeng group, with the support of the workers and technicians in the entire workshop, achieved three technical reforms in one fell swoop, increasing production efficiency by 23 times, 16 times, and 2 times respectively, and becoming an advanced group in one fell swoop. At the same time, the Wang Lu group also adopted the advanced experience of clamping more workpieces on the planing machine, increasing the number of workpieces planed each time from one to three or four, closely following the requirements of the boring group. At this time, the three main groups processing pump bodies simultaneously reached a production level of processing more than three pump bodies per day.
    The workers had a strong reaction to this matter. They compared the boring group to the "dragon head." When the "dragon head" swung, it drove the rapid following of various links such as grinding, drilling, and planing parts processing, from imbalance to a new balance.
    Inspired by this experience, the factory Party committee started a one-dragon large-scale collaborative competition for vacuum pump production in the Second Workshop in September. The relevant groups participating in this production took the initiative to link up with each other, signed competition contact contracts, determined the items and times of mutual supply of parts for each process, and jointly guaranteed the early and comprehensive overfulfillment of the state plan. Based on the good or bad completion of various agreements in the contract, the workshop evaluated and inspected every day, awarded the red flag of "Dragon Head Model Worker" to the group with the best completion, and immediately urged and helped the "Dragon Tail" group lagging behind to catch up quickly.
    As soon as this competition was launched, the labor enthusiasm and collectivism of the employees in the Second Workshop rose unprecedentedly. All groups competed with each other to become the "dragon head," and helped each other, so that all links, such as key large parts and other medium and small parts, simultaneously leapt forward. In the competition, the entire workshop also widely carried out "three help" activities of quick hands helping slow hands, skilled hands helping raw hands, and old hands helping new hands, learning from each other's strengths and compensating for weaknesses, and generally improving the technical level. This workshop only completed 27.7% of the annual plan in the first half of the year. Since launching the one-dragon large-scale collaborative competition centered on technical innovation, without adding a single worker or transferring a single machine tool, it completed the monthly production plans seven days and eight days ahead of schedule in September and October respectively, and fully completed the annual state plan two months and eight days ahead of schedule.
    The factory Party committee promptly summarized and promoted the experience of the Second Workshop. From October, with three main products as the objects, it organized three one-dragon large-scale collaborative competitions throughout the factory, starting from the supply of blanks to packaging and sales. All the factory's workers, technicians, and administrative management personnel were involved in this competition. The factory also organized two special work groups to assist relevant workshops in breaking through the main weak links in production. As of November 23, the factory had completed the production plan of 700 vacuum pumps this year. Now the employees are continuing to work hard to strive to fully and over fulfill the factory's state plan twenty days to one month ahead of schedule, and have freed up strength to start the trial production of new products for next year ahead of schedule.

    技术革新结合连环竞赛  共同促进产品迅速成套
    太原市和北京兴平机械厂创造好经验
    本报讯　目前太原市工矿企业和基本建设部门中广泛展开的“连环战”竞赛，有效地改变了生产中的不平衡状态，促进产品更快地配套。
    “连环战”竞赛和对手赛是目前太原工业、基本建设部门劳动竞赛的主要形式，大约有90％以上的工人都参加了这种竞赛。早在今年7月，太原全市便形成了各行有标兵、各工种有标兵的广泛对手赛。仅据五十六个工业和基本建设单位统计，就树起了车间、科室标兵五十一个，队组标兵四百四十二个，个人标兵九百六十五人。围绕着标兵，出现了三百六十个先进车间、二百五十五个先进工段、三千八百多个先进小组和六万二千多名先进生产者。
    对手赛虽然为调动广大职工积极性和发挥他们的首创精神开辟了广阔的天地，却不能完全解决高度协作问题。科室、工种、小组、工段以至车间之间的先进和落后的差异，仍然影响着生产水平的全面提高，有一些企业总产值月月超计划，产品却常常配不成套。因此，以企业的总任务和重点产品为明确的战斗目标，把开展协作、组织平衡，变成广大职工自觉的行动就十分必要。这一任务便由新出现的“连环战”竞赛解决了。
    “连环战”竞赛形式是以一种产品、一项工种为中心，吸引有关的小组、工段、车间、科室以及兄弟单位的前线与前线、前线与后方、内部与外部大协作的竞赛。它有三条主要战线，这就是：产品大连环、生产前线与技术后方大连环、生产与生活大连环。在各条战线上又有许多小连环，大小连环纵横交错，使一个生产单位形成一环扣一环、环环相连的协作整体。这种竞赛调动起来的不仅是工人，而且包括技术人员和干部，不仅是厂内，而且促进了兄弟厂的生产。对于改变生产各个环节上不平衡，保证共同提高方面发挥了巨大的作用。太原市工业、基本建设战线上大闹“连环战”竞赛的结果是产品配套的形势有了很大的改变；也促使广大职工参加了企业的技术管理和行政管理。太原机车车辆厂在竞赛中新修改和健全了各种制度达二百三十四种，修改工艺规程、技术条件四百五十多项，还修改了四百八十张图纸，充实和整顿了六十多项工艺装备，从而建立了一套新的管理秩序。
    本报讯　北京兴平机械厂开展以技术革新为中心的一条龙大协作竞赛，在先进的基础上不断组织新的平衡，实现了既先进又均衡成套的生产。
    兴平机械厂今年下半年生产的主要产品都是大型的新产品，在设备、技术条件方面存在着不少困难。全厂职工学习了党的八届八中全会文件后，掀起了新的生产高潮。二车间张德源搪孔小组首先实行了三项技术措施，把搪一个泵体的时间由二十七小时压缩到六小时左右，全组由每天加工一个泵体提高到三个多。搪孔小组一跃进，上道工序的王禄刨工组和下道工序的马云鹏钳工组顿时紧张起来，一个来不及供应刨件，一个来不及研磨钻孔。车间党总支立即抓住这两个薄弱环节，发动工人千方百计大闹技术革新。马云鹏小组经过刻苦钻研，在全车间工人和技术人员的支援下，一举实现了三项技术改革，使生产效率分别提高二十三倍、十六倍和二倍，一跃而成为先进小组。在这同时，王禄小组也采用了刨车上多夹活的先进经验，每次由刨一个活提高到刨三、四个活，紧紧跟上了搪孔小组的要求。这时，加工泵体的三个主要小组同时都达到了每天加工三台多泵体的生产水平。
    工人们对这件事产生了强烈的反映，他们把搪孔小组比做“龙头”，“龙头”一摆，带动了研磨、钻孔、刨件加工等各环节迅速跟上，由不平衡达到了新的平衡。
    工厂党委在这个经验的启发下，从9月起首先在二车间开展了真空泵生产一条龙大协作竞赛。参加这项生产的各有关小组，互相主动挂钩，签订竞赛联系合同，确定各道工序彼此供应部件的项目和时间，共同保证提前全面超额完成国家计划。根据合同中各项协议完成情况的好坏，车间每天评比检查，对完成情况最好的小组，授予“龙头标兵”的红旗，对落在后面的“龙尾”小组，马上督促和帮助他们迅速跟上。
    这个竞赛一开展，二车间职工劳动热情和集体主义精神空前高涨。各小组你追我赶，争当“龙头”，并且互相帮助，使关键大件和其他中小件等所有环节，都同时跃进。在竞赛中，全车间还广泛开展了快手帮慢手，熟手帮生手，老手帮新手的“三帮”活动，互相取长补短，普遍提高了技术水平。这个车间在上半年只完成全年计划的27.7％，开展以技术革新为中心的一条龙大协作竞赛以来，没有增加一个工人，也没有调进一台机床，在9、10两月分别提前七天和八天完成了月生产计划，并提前两个月零八天全面完成了全年的国家计划。
    工厂党委及时总结和推广了二车间的经验，从10月起，以三种主要产品为对象，从毛坯供应开始到包装、销售为止，在全厂范围内组织三个一条龙大协作竞赛。全厂的工人、技术人员、行政管理人员一起卷入了这场竞赛中。全厂还组织了两个专门工作组，协助有关车间突破生产中的主要薄弱环节。到11月23日为止，全厂今年七百台真空泵生产计划已经全部完成，现在职工们正继续鼓足干劲，力争提前二十天至一个月全面超额完成全厂的国家计划，并已腾出力量，提前开始了明年新产品的试制工作。
