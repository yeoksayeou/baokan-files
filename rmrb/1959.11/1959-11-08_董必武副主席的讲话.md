Comrade Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:

    Today is the forty-second anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. We are celebrating this glorious festival of working people all over the world with great excitement along with the great Soviet people. First of all, please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China, to extend the warmest and heartfelt congratulations to the fraternal Soviet people and the Soviet government.

    The great October Socialist Revolution was a turning point in human history. It opened a broad road for mankind from capitalism to communism. Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet People carried out a great revolution, unprecedented and globally shocking, turning the ideal of socialism into reality. For forty-two years, the Soviet people, after arduous and glorious struggles, have established and consolidated the Soviet regime. In a short historical period, they have built a backward and poor Tsarist Russia into an advanced and prosperous socialist country. Now, under the correct leadership of The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union headed by Comrade Khrushchev, the Soviet people have entered a new stage of historical development, namely, the period of comprehensively building communism. All the Soviet people are striving with great political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm to complete the Seven-Year Plan far ahead of schedule. It can be asserted that the days when the Soviet Union catches up with and surpasses the United States in terms of total industrial and agricultural output and per capita output are not far off. The great achievements of the Soviet Union in the development of cutting-edge science are beyond the reach of any capitalist country. The Soviet Union's continuous launching of space rockets and the establishment of automatic interplanetary stations mark the beginning of mankind's ascent to other planets. All this fully and powerfully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

    The great Soviet people have continuously made significant contributions to the lofty cause of safeguarding world peace. Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States in September this year has had a positive and far-reaching impact on easing international tensions and safeguarding world peace. Comrade Khrushchev's proposal to the United Nations General Assembly on complete and thorough disarmament has opened up new avenues for the disarmament issue. A few days ago, the Third Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union adopted a resolution calling on the parliaments of all countries to work to ease international tensions and achieve complete and thorough disarmament. The Chinese government and the Chinese people fully support this peaceful initiative, which conforms to the wishes of the people of the world, and are willing to work with the Soviet people and the people of all countries to achieve its complete realization. At present, the international situation continues to develop in a direction favorable to peace and socialism. The forces of world peace far outweigh the forces of war of imperialism. In the face of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world, the aggressive and war policies of imperialism headed by the United States will inevitably suffer greater defeats.

    The Chinese revolution is a continuation of the great October Revolution. For ten years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved one great victory after another in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The Chinese people have consistently received fraternal assistance from the Soviet people in the revolutionary struggle and socialist construction. Please allow me to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to the Soviet government and the Soviet people on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people.

    The deep friendship that has long existed between the people of China and the Soviet Union has been fully and deeply developed in the recent ten years. Not long ago, the Soviet party and government delegation headed by Comrade Khrushchev came to our country to participate in the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, once again proving the fraternal friendship between our two countries. All the conspiracies of the reactionary

### 董必武副主席的讲话

    董必武副主席的讲话亲爱的大使同志，同志们，朋友们：
    今天是伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年。我们怀着十分兴奋和愉快的心情，同伟大的苏联人民一起来欢庆这个全世界劳动人民的光辉节日。首先，请允许我代表中国人民和中华人民共和国政府向兄弟般的苏联人民和苏联政府致以最热烈的、衷心的祝贺。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命是人类历史的转折点，它为人类打开了从资本主义通向共产主义的康庄大道。苏联人民在光荣的苏联共产党的领导下，胜利地进行了史无前例的、震撼全球的伟大革命，把社会主义的理想变成了现实。四十二年来，苏联人民经过艰苦而光辉的奋斗，建立和巩固了苏维埃政权，在短短的历史时期中，把一个落后的、贫穷的沙皇俄国建成为先进的、富强的社会主义国家。现在，苏联人民在以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联共产党中央委员会的正确领导下，进入了一个新的历史发展阶段，即全面展开共产主义建设的时期。全体苏联人民正以巨大的政治热情和劳动热情，为大大提前完成七年计划而奋斗，可以断言，苏联在工农业总产量和按人口平均产量方面赶上和超过美国的日子已经不远了。苏联在发展尖端科学方面所取得的伟大成就，更是任何资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。苏联连续发射宇宙火箭和建立自动行星际站的壮举，标志着人类攀登其他星球的开端。这一切，充分有力地显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    伟大的苏联人民在维护世界和平的崇高事业中不断地作出重大的贡献。今年9月，赫鲁晓夫同志的美国之行，对于和缓国际紧张局势和维护世界和平的事业产生了积极而深远的影响。赫鲁晓夫同志在访问美国期间向联合国大会提出的关于全面彻底裁军的建议，为裁军问题开辟了新的途径。几天前，苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议通过决议，呼吁各国议会为和缓国际紧张局势和实现全面彻底裁军而努力。中国政府和中国人民完全支持这一符合全世界人民意愿的和平创议，并且愿意同苏联人民和各国人民一起，为其彻底实现而努力。目前，国际形势继续朝着有利于和平和社会主义的方向发展。世界和平力量大大地超过了帝国主义的战争势力。东风正进一步压倒西风。在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平的人民面前，以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，必将遭到更大的失败。
    中国革命是伟大的十月革命的继续。十年来，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，取得了一个接一个的伟大胜利。中国人民在革命斗争和社会主义建设事业中，一贯得到苏联人民的兄弟般的援助。请允许我借这个机会，代表中国政府和中国人民向苏联政府和苏联人民表示衷心的感谢。
    中苏两国人民之间久已存在的深厚友谊，最近十年来，得到了全面和深入的发展。不久以前，以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联党政代表团来我国参加建国十周年庆祝典礼，再一次证明我们两国之间的兄弟友谊。以美帝国主义为首的反动势力妄图破坏中苏团结的一切阴谋，已经而且还将遭到可耻的失败。中苏两国建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的伟大团结，是牢不可破的。中苏两国人民之间的传统友谊和以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的友好团结将不断增强和巩固。
    同志们，朋友们，在这个普天同庆的节日里，我提议：
    为伟大的十月社会主义革命，
    为苏联共产党和苏联政府，
    为正在建设共产主义的苏联人民，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营日益巩固和壮大，
    为中苏两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊，
    为世界持久和平，
    为赫鲁晓夫同志的健康，
    为伏罗希洛夫同志的健康，
    干杯！
