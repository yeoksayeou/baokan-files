Xinhua News Agency, November 20th – A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented:
Lloyd's note of November 14th replying to Foreign Minister Chen Yi's note rejected the proposal made to him by Foreign Minister Chen Yi on October 31st, namely, that the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference immediately take urgent measures in accordance with the Geneva Agreements to stop the Royal Lao Government's so-called "trial" of Souphanouvong and others, and to urge the Royal Lao Government to restore their freedom to prevent further deterioration of the situation in Laos.

In his reply, Mr. Lloyd, on the one hand, said that Britain is eager to do everything possible to ensure that the Geneva Agreements on Laos are upheld; but on the other hand, he arbitrarily said that the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front violated the laws of the Kingdom of Laos, and therefore believes that the Royal Lao Government's trial of Prince Souphanouvong and others is an internal affair of the Kingdom of Laos, and other countries should not interfere.

Everyone knows that since the former Lao Fighting Units signed the Vientiane Armistice Agreement with the Royal Lao Government in accordance with the Geneva Agreements, the Royal Lao Government has continuously taken measures to undermine these agreements, up to the point of launching armed attacks against the former Lao Fighting Units and trying the leaders of the former Lao Fighting Units and the Lao Patriotic Front. Using the restoration of war to deal with international agreements to cease war, and using open persecution to deal with the clear provisions that there should be no retaliation or discrimination against the former Lao Fighting Units – can it be said that the Royal Lao Government has not violated the Geneva Agreements? Mr. Lloyd closes his eyes to these facts, stands with the violators of the agreement, and groundlessly says that the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front violated Lao law and should therefore be tried, and that other countries should not interfere. Mr. Lloyd forgets that the prohibition of retaliation and discrimination against personnel of the former Lao Fighting Units is a clear provision in an international agreement, and the Royal Lao Government has an obligation to abide by this provision, and the participating countries of the Geneva Conference also have an obligation to promote compliance with this provision. If the participating countries of the Geneva Conference demanding that the Royal Lao Government fulfill the Geneva Agreements constitutes interference in Laos' internal affairs, would the Geneva Agreements themselves not become an international agreement interfering in Laos' internal affairs?

Mr. Lloyd says that the Queen's government is eager to do everything possible to ensure that the Geneva Agreements on Laos are upheld. If this is not just empty talk, then he should, together with the Soviet government, as the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference, take measures to stop the Royal Lao Government's trial and persecution of Prince Souphanouvong and others.

Blaming the deterioration of the situation in Laos on the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which strictly abides by the Geneva Agreements, is slander and also useless. Hasn't even the United Nations investigation subcommittee been unable to find any evidence? The real culprit is the United States. On July 21, 1954, the U.S. representative solemnly declared to the world at the Geneva Conference that it would not use force or threat to obstruct the Geneva Agreements. Now everyone sees that it is the United States that is perfidious and uses various methods, including providing military force, to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Laos. It is the British government that should use its influence to make the U.S. authorities realize the importance of abiding by its July 21, 1954 statement.

Xinhua News Agency, November 20th – The British Chargé d'Affaires in China submitted a reply from British Foreign Secretary Lloyd to Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on November 14th. As one of the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference, the British Foreign Secretary actually rejected in this reply the following proposal made by Foreign Minister Chen Yi in his letter of October 31st: that the Soviet government and the British government, as the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, immediately take measures to stop the Royal Lao Government's so-called "trial" of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, and to urge the Royal Lao Government to restore their freedom in accordance with the Geneva Agreements, in order to prevent further deterioration of the situation in Laos.

In his reply, Lloyd openly shielded the Royal Lao Government's decision to "try" Prince Souphanouvong and others, an act that undermines the Geneva and Vientiane Agreements, and evaded the responsibility that the chair countries of the Geneva Conference must bear to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Laos. The reply actually claimed that the "trial" of Prince Souphanouvong and others "is a matter for the Lao authorities, and interference by other governments is inappropriate," and even said that "any action by the two chairmen or the International Commission to interfere between the Lao courts and members of the Lao Patriotic Front would constitute interference in Laos and violate paragraph 12 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference."

In his reply, Lloyd also evaded an important provision of the Geneva and Vientiane Agreements, namely that there should be no retaliation or persecution against members of the Lao Patriotic Front, personnel of the former Lao Fighting Units, and former resistance personnel. He then tried his best to defend the Royal Lao Government's crimes of persecuting Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, saying that "nothing in these agreements excludes the Lao authorities from bringing charges before the Lao courts against members of the Lao Patriotic Front for violations of Lao law committed after the signing of the armistice agreement." At the same time, Lloyd distorted the terms of the Vientiane Agreement, saying that the political agreement signed by the two Lao sides in Vientiane on November 2, 1957, stipulating that the Lao Patriotic Front and other Lao political parties should be granted the same rights and freedoms, "depends on whether the charter of the Lao Patriotic Front conforms to Lao law"; and that "whether the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front have violated the law should be determined by the Lao courts."

In his reply, Lloyd attempted to deny the many facts of the Royal Lao Government's continuous violation of the Geneva and Vientiane Agreements since February of this year, as pointed out in Minister Chen Yi's letter of October 31st, by using the Lao Foreign Minister's empty statement made in Paris on October 31st that "we will not do anything that contradicts the terms of the Geneva Agreements."

In his reply, Lloyd once again expressed his opposition to the resumption of activities by the International Commission for Laos, which is responsible for monitoring and supervising the implementation of the Geneva Agreements, and distorted the truth, attempting to shirk responsibility for the United States and shift the responsibility for the serious situation caused by the U.S. instigating the Lao Phoui Sananikone government to undermine the Geneva and Vientiane Agreements and re-ignite the civil war onto others. He even groundlessly and insidiously slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, expressing the hope that the Chinese government would "use its influence, especially to urge North Vietnam to recognize the importance of acting in accordance with paragraph 12 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference."

    新华社记者驳斥劳埃德拒绝我国陈毅外长建议
    英国公然袒护美萨集s团迫害苏发努冯
    劳埃德在复照中规避责任再次反对恢复老挝国际委员会的活动
    新华社20日讯　新华社记者评论说：
    劳埃德先生11月14日复陈毅外交部长的照会拒绝了陈毅外交部长10月31日向他提出的由1954年日内瓦会议两主席根据日内瓦协议立即采取紧急措施制止老挝王国政府对苏发努冯等人进行所谓“审判”，并且促使老挝王国政府恢复他们的自由以防止老挝局势进一步恶化的建议。
    劳埃德先生在复照中，一方面说英国亟愿尽一切可能来保证关于老挝的日内瓦协议得到维护；但另一方面却武断地说，老挝爱国战线党领导人违反了老挝王国的法律，因而认为老挝王国对苏发努冯亲王等人进行审判，是老挝王国的内政，其它国家不应干涉。
    大家都知道，自从前寮国战斗部队根据日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府签订了万象停战协议以来，老挝王国政府就不断采取措施破坏这些协议，直到向前寮国战斗部队发起武装进攻和对前寮国战斗部队和老挝爱国战线党领导人进行审判；用恢复战争的办法来对待停止战争的国际协议，用公开的迫害来对待不得对前寮国战斗部队进行报复和歧视的明确规定，能说老挝王国政府还没有破坏日内瓦协议吗？劳埃德先生闭着眼睛不看这些事实，却和协议破坏者站在一起，毫无根据地说老挝爱国战线党领导人违反了老挝的法律，因而应该受到审判，其他国家不应干涉。劳埃德先生忘记了不得对前寮国战斗部队人员进行报复和歧视是一项国际协议中的明确规定，老挝王国政府有义务遵守这项规定，日内瓦会议参加国家也有义务促使这项规定得到遵守。如果日内瓦会议参加国家要求老挝王国政府履行日内瓦协议就是干涉老挝内政，日内瓦协议本身岂不是变成了一个干涉老挝内政的国际协定？
    劳埃德先生说，女王政府亟欲尽一切可能来保证关于老挝的日内瓦协议得到维护，如果这不是一句空话，那末他就应该和苏联政府一道，作为日内瓦会议的联合主席，采取措施，制止老挝王国政府对苏发努冯亲王等人的审判和迫害。
    把老挝局势恶化的责任，推到严格遵守日内瓦协议的越南民主共和国身上，是诬蔑，也是无用的。不是连联合国调查小组委员会也没有能够找到什么证据吗？真正的罪魁是美国。1954年7月21日，美国代表在日内瓦会议上庄严地向全世界宣告，它将不使用武力或威胁去妨碍日内瓦协议。现在大家都看到，背信弃义、用各种方法包含用提供军事力量去妨碍日内瓦协议在老挝的实施的是美国。倒是英国政府应该运用它的影响，促使美国当局认识到遵守它的1954年7月21日声明的重要性。
    新华社20日讯　英国驻中国代办处在11月14日向我国外交部递交了英国外交大臣劳埃德给我国外交部长陈毅的一项复照。作为1954年日内瓦会议两位主席之一的英国外交大臣，在这项复照中竟拒绝了陈毅外交部长在10月31日写给他的信中提出的下述建议：作为日内瓦会议两主席国的苏联政府和英国政府立即采取措施，制止老挝王国政府对苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人进行所谓“审判”，并且促使老挝王国政府根据日内瓦协议恢复他们的自由，以防止老挝局势进一步恶化。
    劳埃德在他的复照中，公然袒护老挝王国政府决定对苏发努冯亲王等人进行“审判”这种破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议的行为，并且规避日内瓦会议主席国为保证日内瓦协议在老挝的实施而必须担负的责任，复照竟宣称对苏发努冯亲王等人进行“审判”“是老挝当局的事情，其它政府进行干预是不适当的”，还说什么“两位主席或国际委员会任何在老挝法庭和老挝爱国战线党成员之间进行干预的行动将构成对老挝的干涉，并且违反日内瓦会议最后宣言第十二段”。
    劳埃德在他的复照中，还规避了日内瓦协议和万象协议的一项重要规定，即不得对老挝爱国战线党成员、前寮国战斗部队人员和前抗战人员进行报复和迫害。接着他就极力为老挝政府迫害苏发努冯等老挝爱国战线党领导人的罪行辩解，说“这些协议中没有任何规定排除老挝当局对于老挝爱国战线党成员在停战协定签订以后所犯的违反老挝法律的行为向老挝法庭提出控告”。同时，劳埃德还歪曲万象协议的条文，说什么1957年11月2日老挝双方在万象签订的政治协议规定给予老挝爱国战线党的和老挝其它政党同样的权利和自由需要“取决于老挝爱国战线党的章程是否符合老挝法律”；而“老挝爱国战线党领导人是否违反了法律，应由老挝法庭确定”。
    劳埃德在复照中，企图用老挝外交大臣10月31日在巴黎发表的“我们将不会做出与日内瓦协议条款相违背的事”这一空洞声明，来否认陈毅部长在10月31日的信件中指出的老挝王国政府在今年2月以来连续破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议的许多事实。
    劳埃德在复照中再次表示反对恢复负有监察和监督实施日内瓦协议的责任的老挝国际委员会的活动，并且歪曲事实真象，替美国推卸责任，企图把美国指使老挝培·萨纳尼空政府破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议来重新挑起内战所造成的严重局势的责任推到别人身上。他竟毫无根据地和含沙射影地诬蔑越南民主共和国，表示希望中国政府“运用它的影响，特别是促使北越认识到按照日内瓦会议最后宣言第十二段行事的重要性”。
