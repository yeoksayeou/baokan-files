Xinhua News Agency, 30th - TASS reports: Soviet scientists continued to publish articles in newspapers on the 30th, commenting on the great scientific significance of the Soviet Union's photographs of the far side of the moon.

	Soviet Deputy Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Boskovsky, wrote in "Red Star": After the Soviet Union took pictures of the far side of the moon, now more than 85% of the main objects on the lunar surface can be drawn on the lunar map. Detailed study of the photographs of the far side of the moon will undoubtedly enrich science. Before this, people always believed that the longest mountain range on the moon was the Apennine Mountains (about 700 kilometers). The newly discovered Soviet Mountains on the far side of the moon exceeds 2,000 kilometers. The Tsiolkovsky crater discovered in the southern part of the far side of the moon may be larger than the largest Copernicus crater on the visible side of the moon.

	Undoubtedly, when taking pictures of the far side of the moon from a closer distance and under various solar irradiations in the future, the height of the newly discovered mountains on the moon and the depth of the "seas" can be determined; many detailed problems can be clarified. After accurately knowing the shape of the moon, it will be possible to calculate the orbits of new lunar rockets well, solve the task of manufacturing artificial lunar satellites, and finally enable spacecraft to land smoothly on the lunar surface.

	Ala Mashevich, Deputy Chairman of the Astronomical Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, published an article in "Soviet Navy News" saying that now it can be boldly said that a new chapter in lunar geography has been written. We have a complete lunar map.

	The article pointed out that the obvious structures on the far side of the moon seem to be relatively few. This is an interesting thing from the perspective of celestial evolution. It can help to clarify the truth about the origin and development of the moon, and it is also necessary to solve the problem of the origin of the earth.

    苏联科学家著文指出
    月球地理新的一章已写成
    据新华社30日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联科学家30日继续在报纸上发表文章，评述苏联拍摄月球背面照片的巨大科学意义。
    苏联物理数学副博士波斯科夫斯基在“红星报”上写道：在苏联摄得月球背面照片后，现在可以把85％以上的月球表面的主要对象绘在月面图上了。详细研究月球背面的照片，无疑的将使科学丰富起来。在这以前，人们一直认为月球上最长的山系是亚平宁山（约七百公里）。而在月球背面新发现的苏维埃山系却超过了两千公里。在月球背面南部发现的齐奥尔科夫斯基寰形山可能比月球可见面上最大的哥白尼寰形山大。
    无疑地，将来从更近的距离和在太阳的各种照射下给月球背面拍摄照片时，就可以确定出新发现的月球上的山的高度和“海”的深度；弄清许多细节问题。准确地知道月球的形状后，便可以很好地计算新的月球火箭的轨道，解决制造人造月球卫星的任务，并且最后使宇宙飞船顺利降落到月球表面。
    苏联科学院天文学委员会副主席阿拉·马谢维奇在“苏联海军报”上发表文章说，现在已经可以大胆地说：月球地理的新的一章已经写成。我们有了完备的月面图。
    文章指出，在月球背面的明显的结构似乎比较少。这从天体演变的观点看来是件有趣的事。它能有助于阐明月球的起源和发展的真相，对解决地球起源问题同样也是必要的。
