Xinhua News Agency, 29th – The "Small Autumn Harvest" movement carried out throughout the country has achieved great results. The quantity of wild fibers, starches, oilseeds, tannin extracts, and wild medicinal herbs, miscellaneous fruits, and mountain products collected has greatly exceeded any period in history.

While collecting and purchasing, various regions vigorously carried out a mass movement for processing and utilization. In Jianhe County, Guizhou Province, led by the county party secretary, a mass movement for processing wild plants was launched on a large scale, resulting in a new situation where communes ran factories, production teams ran factories, and everyone participated. The masses were highly motivated, with many communes and team members collecting during the day and processing at night. So far, more than 10,000 commune-run processing plants and sideline processing groups have been established in the county, and 400,000 jin of white wine alone have been processed. Lianjiang County in Fujian has processed more than 6,000 dan of wild fibers to replace palm and jute for the fishing industry, and has processed more than 2,700 dan of wild starch and more than 110 dan of wild oilseeds to supply raw materials for industry and handicrafts. Fujian Province has used wild fibers as raw materials to weave nearly 30,000 earth sacks. Baoding in Hunan, Lushan in Henan, Anda in Heilongjiang, and Tianzhu in Gansu are also working hard to weave sacks from wild fiber plants.

Since the State Council issued the "Instructions on Deeply Mobilizing the Masses to Widely Collect and Fully Utilize Wild Plant Raw Materials," calling on various regions to launch a "Small Autumn Harvest" movement, party committees in various regions have attached great importance to it. Like grasping the summer harvest and autumn harvest, they have listed the "Small Autumn Harvest" movement as an important task for the Party in rural areas, establishing leadership organizations and organizing relevant departments to work together. Many regions have educated cadres, publicized the importance of collecting wild plants, launched debates on "whether or not to engage in small autumn harvest" and "whether to engage in a big or small scale," and criticized and overcome the erroneous ideas of some cadres who disliked wild plants being scattered and "having no profit," fearing trouble, fearing stockpiling, and fearing losses. They adopted methods such as holding exhibitions, distributing samples, and printing publicity materials to publicize to commune members, and then organized the masses to go to the mountains to collect. Some commune members in Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province, after seeing the exhibition, reflected that "treasures are everywhere, as long as people look for them," and their enthusiasm for collecting wild plants was very high. Due to the importance attached by the Party committees and the strengthening of leadership, a massive "Small Autumn Harvest" movement was quickly launched throughout the country.

In the "Small Autumn Harvest" movement, various regions have fully utilized the superiority of the people's communes, making every effort to tap the potential of labor and mobilize all forces. When organizing the masses to collect, there are roughly the following forms: First, in areas with high yields of wild plants, utilizing gaps in agricultural work, led by the secretary, the entire population is mobilized, areas are divided and contracted, and short-term assaults are carried out. Some regions, according to the different maturity periods of various wild plants, closely intersperse with agricultural production, divide into several stages, and adopt the method of "ripening a batch, picking a batch, and harvesting a batch," carrying out collection and purchase in batches. Second, in areas where autumn harvest work is busy, a certain number of laborers are drawn out to establish "Small Autumn Harvest" professional teams to undertake the work of collecting wild plants. Third, commune members are mobilized to use their spare time or squeeze out time by improving labor efficiency to collect wild plants concurrently. In addition, various regions have widely mobilized all idle laborers and semi-laborers to cooperate in the collection. In organizing the masses to collect wild plants, in addition to strengthening political and ideological work, various regions have implemented the principle of "payment according to labor, more work more pay," and reasonably stipulated income distribution methods according to local conditions, encouraging the enthusiasm of the masses.

    多快好省地把野生植物用到生产和生活中去
    “小秋收”大丰收  边采购边加工
    各地采取集中和分散同时并重的方法建立加工工业
    新华社29日讯　全国各地开展的“小秋收”运动取得了很大的成绩，采集的野生纤维、淀粉、油料、栲胶原料和野生药材、杂果、山货等的数量，大大超过了历史上任何时期。
    各地在采集和收购的同时，大力开展了加工利用的群众运动。贵州省剑河县由县委书记挂帅，大搞野生植物加工的群众运动，出现了社社办厂、队队办厂、人人动手的新局面。群众干劲十足，许多社、队员白天采集晚上加工。到目前为止，全县已经建立社办加工厂和副业加工小组一万多个，仅加工的白酒就有四十万斤。福建连江县已加工了六千多担野生纤维，代替棕麻供应渔业；加工出二千七百多担野生淀粉和一百一十多担野生油料，供应工业和手工业作原料。福建省已用野生纤维作原料织出土麻袋近三万条。湖南保靖、河南鲁山、黑龙江安达、甘肃天祝等县也正在努力用野生纤维植物织造麻袋。
    自从国务院发出“关于深入发动群众广泛采集和充分利用野生植物原料的指示”，号召各地开展一个“小秋收”运动以后，各地党委都很重视，像抓夏收、秋收一样，把“小秋收”运动列为党在农村的一项重要任务，建立领导机构，组织有关部门协同工作。许多地区对干部进行了教育，宣传了采集野生植物的重要意义，开展了“要不要搞小秋收”、“大搞还是小搞”的辩论，批判和克服了一些干部嫌野生植物零星分散、“没油水”、嫌麻烦、怕积压、怕赔钱等错误思想；采取举办展览会、发样品、印发宣传品等方式，向社员群众开展宣传，然后组织群众上山采集。江苏南京市有的社员在看完展览会后反映“遍地都是宝，只要人去找”，采集野生植物的积极性很高。由于党委的重视和加强领导，全国各地很快就掀起了一个声势浩大的“小秋收”运动。
    在“小秋收”运动中，各地都充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，千方百计挖掘劳动力潜力，调动一切力量。在组织群众采集时，大体有以下几种形式：第一，在野生植物产量多的地区，利用农事空隙，由书记挂帅，全民动员，划片包干，实行短期突击；有的地区根据各种野生植物的不同成熟期，与农业生产紧密穿插，划分几个阶段，采取“熟一批、采一批、收一批”的作法，分批突击采集收购。第二，秋收工作繁忙的地区，抽出一定数量的劳动力，建立“小秋收”专业队，担负采集野生植物的工作。第三，发动社员利用工余时间，或提高劳动效率挤出时间，兼带采集野生植物。此外，各地都广泛动员一切闲散劳动力、半劳动力配合采集。各地在组织群众采集野生植物中，除了加强政治思想工作之外，都贯彻执行了“按劳取酬，多劳多得”的原则，因地制宜地合理地规定了收益分配办法，鼓励了群众的积极性。（附图片）
