Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 23rd - Burmese Minister of Culture, Wu Qixing, stated at the opening ceremony of the Chinese Photo Exhibition here today, "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the People's Republic of China has made great leaps forward in restoring and building culture and industry in the past ten years."

The Chinese Photo Exhibition is sponsored by the Chinese Embassy in Burma. Among those who attended the opening ceremony were Burmese Deputy Prime Minister U Lun Baw, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice U Chan Tun Aung, Chairman of the Burma-China Friendship Association Dr. Htin Baw, prominent Burmese writers, artists, and journalists, as well as diplomatic envoys from some countries to Burma.

Minister Wu Qixing, as the representative of the Burmese government and the head of the Burmese cultural and friendly delegation, recently attended the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing and visited various parts of China. He said at the opening ceremony, "I have found the people of the People's Republic of China to be very diligent, disciplined, thrifty, and patriotic. The Chinese people, with these excellent qualities, are building their country with great enthusiasm and dedication."

Minister Wu Qixing pointed out, "In Beijing itself, the newly built Great Hall of the People, the Chinese History Museum, the National Culture Palace, the Beijing Railway Station, the Beijing Airport, and many newly built modern hotels are the most prominent symbols of which the Chinese people should be proud. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, recently completed in an unprecedentedly short period of time, is, in my opinion, the best bridge in the East."

Minister Wu Qixing said, "What I have mentioned are only a few important constructions that the diligent workers of the People's Republic of China have built in recent years. This photo exhibition, which I am pleased to preside over, will soon allow you to understand the remarkable progress made by the People's Republic of China under the leadership of Chairman Mao."

Minister Wu Qixing believes that "this photo exhibition will further strengthen the very close friendship and understanding that already exists between the Union of Burma and the People's Republic of China."

Chinese Ambassador to Burma, Li Yimang, expressed at the opening ceremony his hope that this exhibition would be of interest to the Burmese public.

The photo exhibition will be held in Rangoon for seven days. The exhibition includes five parts: Glorious Country, Economic Construction, Cultural Construction, People's Life, and International Friendship.

    我图片展览会在仰光开幕
    吴漆东主持开幕式并赞扬我国建设成就
    据新华社仰光23日电　缅甸文化部长吴漆东今天在这里举行的中国图片展览会开幕仪式上说，“在毛泽东主席的领导下，中华人民共和国过去十年中在恢复和建设文化和工业方面有了很大的跃进”。
    中国图片展览会是由中国驻缅甸大使馆举办的。参加展览会开幕式的有缅甸副总理吴伦博，外交部长兼司法部长吴千吞昂，缅中友好协会主席信波博士，缅甸著名的作家、艺术家和记者以及一些国家驻缅甸的外交使节。
    吴漆东部长作为缅甸政府的代表和缅甸文化友好代表团的团长，最近在北京参加了中华人民共和国成立十周年的庆祝典礼，并且在中国各地进行了访问。他在展览会开幕式上说，“我发现中华人民共和国的人民非常勤勉，很有纪律，节俭而且爱国。有着这些优秀品质的中国人民正在以极大的热情和献身精神建设他们的国家。”
    吴漆东部长指出，“在北京本身，新建的人民大会堂、中国历史博物馆、民族文化宫、北京车站、北京飞机场和许多新建的现代旅馆是中国人民应当引以为荣的最突出的标志。最近以空前短促的时间建成的武汉长江大桥，我认为，是东方最好的桥梁。”
    吴漆东部长说，“我提到的，只不过是中华人民共和国勤勉的工人在最近几年内建成的几项重要建设。我愉快地为之主持开幕式的这个图片展览会很快就会使你们了解到中华人民共和国在毛主席领导下所取得的了不起的进步。”
    吴漆东部长认为，“这个图片展览会一定会进一步加强缅甸联邦和中华人民共和国之间已经存在着的非常密切的友谊和谅解。”
    中国驻缅甸大使李一氓在开幕式上，表示希望这个展览会将使缅甸公众感到兴趣。
    这个图片展览会将在仰光举行七天。展览会包括五个部分：辉煌的国家、经济建设、文化建设、人民生活和国际友谊。
