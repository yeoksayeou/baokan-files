Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. "Work hard in the fourth quarter to ensure the completion of more than 200 basic construction projects." This is the bold slogan put forward by 500,000 metallurgical industrial construction workers nationwide after achieving a great harvest in metallurgical industrial construction in the first nine months of this year, striving for an even greater harvest.

　　The more than 200 projects that the metallurgical industry department plans to build in the fourth quarter mainly include: more than 40 blast furnaces with a volume of more than 55 cubic meters each, such as two large blast furnaces of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company and Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, and 14 medium-sized blast furnaces of twelve medium-sized iron and steel enterprises; a large open-hearth furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company; sixty converters in various places; more than 30 rolling mills in key iron and steel enterprises such as Benxi and Dalian and in 19 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions; eight large coke ovens in key iron and steel enterprises such as Anshan, Baotou, and Wuhan. After these projects are put into production on schedule, they will strongly promote the guarantee of completing this year's steel production plan ahead of schedule and over fulfilling it. At the same time, a number of key projects spanning the year are also under construction, which will create favorable conditions for the continued leap forward of the metallurgical industry next year.

　　These more than 200 construction projects are part of this year's metallurgical industry construction plan in our country. In the first nine months of this year, the national metallurgical industry construction realized a continued leap forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, and achieved a comprehensive great harvest of high speed, high quality, and low cost. According to statistics, from January to September, more than 40 blast furnaces with a volume of more than 55 cubic meters, more than 120 converters, and more than 40 rolling mills were built and put into production, which has never happened in any previous year. The main projects include: the three large blast furnaces of Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and Baotou Iron and Steel, each with an annual output of hundreds of thousands of tons of pig iron, 14 medium-sized blast furnaces of medium-sized iron and steel plants such as Fushun, Handan, Longyan, Anyang, Jinan, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Fujian Sanming, Yunnan Anning, and Shanghai No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, the ore dressing machine of Anshan Iron and Steel with an annual output of 600,000 tons of concentrate, and the No. 1 open-hearth furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel with an annual output of more than 200,000 tons of steel. The completion and commissioning of these projects have added a strong new force to this year's steel production front. The construction speed of various projects has been greatly improved. The construction period of a large blast furnace has been shortened from about one year in the past to more than four months, a large open-hearth furnace from 15 months in the past to three months, and a large rolling mill from one year and eight months in the past to 11 months. Moreover, the quality of the projects is excellent, and the construction investment has been saved by half to two-thirds. All these show that the construction speed of my country's metallurgical industry has leaped to a higher stage, which has caused a major revolution in people's concept of construction time: when calculating the construction period, it is no longer based on "year" as in the past, but on "month" and "day." The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry summed up the experience of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward and great harvest on the metallurgical industry construction front. These experiences are mainly: (1) Strengthen the leadership of the Party and adhere to putting politics in command; (2) Vigorously launch mass movements and vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution; (3) Do a good job in preparing before construction; (4) Concentrate superior forces to fight "annihilation battles" and avoid dispersed forces; (5) Organize rapid construction according to the characteristics of different stages of the project; (6) Comprehensively implement three-dimensional cross-parallel operations; (7) Take prefabricated components and pre-assembly as much as possible; (8) Combine strengthening ideological education on valuing quality with strengthening technical management, and combine mass self-examination with professional inspection to ensure project quality; (9) Focus on solving key technical problems according to the characteristics of different projects and different stages; (10) Conduct strict inspection and more tests, and do a good job in completion and acceptance. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has also formulated a "high-speed, high-quality, economical, and collaborative" construction plan, calling on metallurgical industry builders across the country to advance victoriously and complete more than 200 basic construction projects within this year.

　　It is a very arduous task to complete these more than 200 construction projects in just three months. At present, the vast metallurgical industry construction workers across the country are vigorously opposing right-leaning tendencies, vigorously boosting their energy, and confidently launching a labor competition upsurge with the theme of "ten comparisons" to ensure the completion of more than 200 projects and the completion of this year's basic construction plan and completion plan ahead of schedule. The content of the "ten comparisons" is: compare putting politics in command, mass movements, and communist style; compare enthusiasm; compare completing on time and ahead of schedule; compare construction speed; compare project quality; compare saving; compare labor productivity; compare adopting new technologies; compare mechanical integrity and attendance rate; compare safe construction. Metallurgical construction units across the country have launched head-to-head rivalries for similar projects. Many units have established competition headquarters, and many leading cadres have gone deep into the construction site to lead the competition movement.

### 全国五十万冶金基建职工提出豪迈口号  高速优质完成四季度工程  施工又快又安全　质量提高再提高　投资节省再节省

    全国五十万冶金基建职工提出豪迈口号
    高速优质完成四季度工程
    施工又快又安全　质量提高再提高　投资节省再节省
    新华社3日讯　“大干第四季度，确保完成二百多项基本建设工程”，这是全国五十万冶金工业建筑职工在今年头九个月取得冶金工业建设大丰收之后，提出的争取更大丰收的豪迈口号。
    冶金工业部门计划在第四季度建设的二百多项工程，主要包括：四十多座容积各在五十五立米以上的高炉，如太原钢铁公司、重庆钢铁公司的两座大型高炉和十二个中型钢铁企业的十四座中型高炉；武汉钢铁公司的一座大型平炉；各地的六十座转炉；本溪、大连等重点钢铁企业和十九个省、市、自治区的三十多套轧钢机；鞍山、包头、武汉等重点钢铁企业的八座大型炼焦炉等。这些工程按期投入生产以后，对于保证提前超额完成今年的钢铁生产计划，将起有力的促进作用；同时，还有一批跨年度的重点工程，也在紧张施工，将为明年冶金工业的继续跃进创造有利条件。
    这二百多项建设工程，是今年我国冶金工业建设计划的一部分。今年头九个月，全国冶金工业建设在去年大跃进的基础上实现了继续跃进，取得了高速、优质、低成本的全面大丰收。据统计，1至9月建成和投入生产的五十五立米以上的高炉就有四十多座，转炉有一百二十多座，轧钢机有四十多套，这是过去任何一年所不曾有过的。其中主要的工程有：石钢、武钢、包钢的三座年产生铁各为数十万吨的大高炉，抚顺、邯郸、龙烟、安阳、济南、南京、杭州、南昌、福建三明、云南安宁等中型钢铁厂和上海第一钢铁厂的十四座中型高炉，鞍钢年产六十万吨精矿的磁选机，武钢年产二十多万吨钢的一号平炉等。这些工程的建成和投入生产，为今年的钢铁生产战线增添了一支强劲的生力军。各类工程的建设速度提高得很快，一座大型高炉由过去的一年左右缩短到四个多月，一座大型平炉由过去的十五个月缩短到三个月，一个大型轧钢厂由过去的一年零八个月缩短到十一个月。而且，工程质量都是优良的；节约建设投资一半到三分之一。这些都表明我国冶金工业建设速度，跃进到了一个更高的阶段，它使人们在建设的时间观念上引起了一个重大的革命：在计算建设工期时，不再像过去那样以“年”为单位，而是以“月”和“日”为单位了。冶金工业部总结了冶金工业建设战线上全面大跃进、大丰收的经验。这些经验主要是：（一）加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅；（二）大搞群众运动，大搞技术革新和技术革命；（三）做好施工前的准备工作；（四）集中优势力量，打“歼灭战”，避免分散力量；（五）根据工程不同阶段的特点，组织快速施工；（六）全面实行立体交叉平行作业；（七）尽可能采取预制构件和预装配；（八）加强重视质量的思想教育同加强技术管理相结合，群众自己检查同专业检查相结合，保证工程质量；（九）针对不同工程、不同阶段的特点，抓紧解决技术关键问题；（十）严格检查和多进行试验，做好竣工验收工作。冶金工业部还制订了“高速、优质、节约、协作”的施工方案，号召全国冶金工业建设者们乘胜前进，在今年之内完成二百多项基本建设工程。
    在短短三个月时间完成这二百多项建设工程，任务是很艰巨的。目前，全国各地广大的冶金工业建设职工，正在大反右倾，大鼓干劲，信心百倍地掀起了一个以“十比”为内容的劳动竞赛热潮，确保完成二百多项工程和提前完成今年全年的基本建设计划和竣工计划。“十比”的内容是：比政治挂帅、群众运动和共产主义风格，比干劲，比按时和提前竣工，比施工速度，比工程质量，比节约，比劳动生产率，比采用新技术，比机械完好率和出勤率，比安全施工。全国冶金建设单位，按同类工程展开了兵对兵、将对将的对手赛。许多单位成立了竞赛指挥部，许多领导干部都深入施工现场，领导竞赛运动。
