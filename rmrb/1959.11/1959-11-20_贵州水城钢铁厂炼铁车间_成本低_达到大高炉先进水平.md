Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 18th: The Iron Smelting Workshop of the Shuicheng Steel Plant in Guizhou Province has earnestly mobilized the masses of workers to participate in cost management, ensuring high-quality and high-yield pig iron production while also reducing costs. From January to September this year, the average cost of each ton of pig iron was reduced to 99.32 yuan, reaching the advanced level of iron cost of modern large blast furnaces in the country.

The Iron Smelting Workshop of the Shuicheng Steel Plant was gradually established during the Great Leap Forward in steel production last year. Currently, the entire workshop has six small blast furnaces with a total volume of 132.5 cubic meters. Last year, due to consistently maintaining high quality and high yield, this factory was named a Red Flag Unit of Guizhou Province in 1958 by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. Since the beginning of this year, under the slogan of "Continue the Great Leap Forward, Protect the Red Flag," the entire factory has mustered greater enthusiasm and continued to deepen the increase production and practice economy movement with "high quality, high yield, and low cost," further advancing various production indicators, especially cost indicators. From January to early October, pig iron production was 25,920 tons, an increase of 124.2% compared to the same period last year; the pig iron qualification rate reached 100%; the average utilization coefficient of the blast furnace was 1.236; the average coke ratio was 0.967; and the cost was only equal to one-third of the cost of pig iron from ordinary small blast furnaces in the province. In the past nine months, the entire factory has accumulated 2,847,900 yuan in funds for the state.

The ability of the Shuicheng Steel Plant to achieve high quality, high yield, and reduced costs is the result of adhering to putting politics in command and vigorously carrying out mass movements. At the beginning of the year, after the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions to guarantee steel production with iron production, the factory Party committee immediately mobilized the masses to launch a blooming and contending debate, criticizing the "emphasizing high yield and neglecting cost" mentality among a few employees, and establishing the viewpoint that "everyone cares about cost and everyone pays attention to saving." The workers quickly launched an increase production and practice economy movement. In the second quarter, the entire factory won the red flag in the inter-factory competition in the provincial metallurgical system with "all-round red" achievements.

After the resolutions and communiqués of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, the workers had even more enthusiasm for production. Competitions for "high quality, high yield, and low cost" were launched between shifts, furnaces, and people. In July, the average cost of iron per ton was 124.11 yuan, in August it dropped to 116.4 yuan, and in September it further decreased to 108 yuan. The utilization coefficient of the blast furnace has also greatly improved.

In terms of production management, this factory has established and improved the furnace chief responsibility system, safety operating procedures, and equipment maintenance systems, thereby ensuring the long-term and steady progress of the high-yield, high-quality, and low-cost movement. It has also established a three-level accounting system for the factory, workshop, and blast furnace, and publishes costs by furnace every ten days, so that workers are well-informed. After the workers directly participated in cost management, they not only effectively reduced costs but also promoted the continuous improvement of management level.

    贵州水城钢铁厂炼铁车间
    成本低——达到大高炉先进水平
    据新华社贵阳18日电　贵州省水城钢铁厂炼铁车间认真发动职工群众参加成本管理以后，既保证了生铁优质高产，又降低了成本。今年1至9月，每吨生铁成本平均降到九十九点三二元，达到了全国现代化大型高炉铁成本的先进水平。
    水城钢铁厂炼铁车间是在去年大办钢铁时逐渐建立起来的。目前全车间共有六座小高炉，总容积为一百三十二点五立方米。去年，这个厂由于一直保持优质、高产，被冶金工业部命名为1958年贵州省红旗单位。今年以来，全厂在“继续跃进保红旗”的口号下，鼓起更大干劲，继续深入开展了“优质、高产、低成本”的增产节约运动，使各项生产指标特别是成本指标，又大大迈进一步。1月到10月上旬，生铁生产二万五千九百二十吨，比去年同期增长124.2％；生铁合格率达到100％；高炉平均利用系数为一点二三六；焦比平均为零点九六七；成本只等于全省一般小高炉生铁成本的三分之一。九个月来，全厂为国家积累了二百八十四点七九万元的资金。
    水城钢铁厂能达到优质、高产、降低成本，是坚持政治挂帅、大搞群众运动的结果。年初，中共贵州省委发出以铁保钢的指示以后，工厂党委立即发动群众展开鸣放辩论，批判了少数职工中“重高产、轻成本”的思想，树立起“人人关心成本、个个注意节约”的观点，职工们迅速地掀起了增产节约运动。第二季度全厂就以“满堂红”的成绩在全省冶金系统厂际竞赛中获得了红旗。
    党的八届八中全会的决议和公报公布以后，职工们生产劲头更足。班与班、炉与炉、人与人之间展开了“优质、高产、低成本”竞赛。7月份每吨铁的成本平均为一百二十四点一一元，8月份便下降到一百一十六点四元，9月份又下降为一百零八元。高炉利用系数也有很大提高。
    在生产管理方面，这个工厂建立和健全了炉长制、安全操作规程和设备维修等制度，从而保证了高产优质低成本运动长期稳步前进。还建立起厂、车间、高炉三级核算制度，按旬分炉公布成本，使工人心中有数。工人们直接参加成本管理以后，不仅有效地降低了成本，还促使管理水平不断提高。
