The gongs and drums sounded, and Ni Zhifu, surrounded by the crowd, walked out of the factory gate. The car engine had already started. Party Secretary Zheng Shaoning still held his hand tightly, leaning into the car door, and said warmly, "I hope you will introduce the experience of the drill bit well at the Hero Conference, and also hope you will learn more advanced experience!" With the surrounding applause, Ni Zhifu saw the freshly written good news sent by his fellow workers: "Glory! Glory, the red flag flutters in Beijing in October, heroes gather together..." At this moment, he felt a surge of heat spread throughout his body, and many past events of creating the drill bit flashed before his eyes.

It was in 1953 that Ni Zhifu, a young worker who had suffered greatly in the old society as a child, came to the Beijing Yongding Machinery Factory. Facing the brand-new machines, the huge factory buildings, and the kind and energetic factory and workshop leaders and veteran workers, recalling his time as a child laborer in factories run by imperialists, and later as an apprentice in capitalist factories, enduring hunger, beatings, and suffering, how could this young man in his twenties not develop a strong love for real life and resolve to use his own hands to better build socialism? From then on, he wanted to learn everything he saw, wishing he could swallow all the world's technology in one gulp. From the fitter's bench to the machine tool, from the workshop to the factory night school, everywhere became his place of learning. He always carried a few pieces of paper in his pocket, immediately noting down any outstanding operations he saw veteran workers perform, copying down advanced experiences introduced in publications such as "Mechanical Worker," and carefully studying and trying to improve every task, big or small, to make it faster and better. Once, the workshop where Ni Zhifu worked received a batch of very troublesome tasks, which required drilling holes in a special kind of steel. Whether it was the young men or the veteran workers, they all used the "standard drill bit" commonly used by fitters to grind away, but they couldn't drill one or two holes for a long time. Everyone was sweating profusely, and they couldn't find a solution. This night shift, Ni Zhifu continued to work on this task. He stood in front of the high radial drill, his eyes fixed on the rotating drill bit, and soon he heard the "squeak" scream from the drill bed. He immediately pulled the drill bit back, and saw that a large piece had been worn away. One hole was not drilled through, and the drill bit had been ground many times. He thought, drilling is one of the main processes in the mechanical industry. Not to mention drillers, fitters, turners, borers, etc., all have drilling tasks. This standard drill bit is not only used by Chinese workers, but also by countries all over the world. Now, it can't handle such hard material. He picked up all the worn-out drill bits, stared blankly for a while, and looked back at the pile of work in front of him. He seemed to hear the Party's call: "This is a batch of urgent production tasks, we must deliver the work as soon as possible." He gritted his teeth and mustered up the courage to continue. After midnight, the second shift workers had already left work, and some people came to ask him to go back to rest together, but he seemed not to have heard them, and continued to ponder his work without raising his head. At this time, he had already tried the flat-bottom drill bit passed down from his master's ancestors, but it couldn't drill holes; he had also tried advanced foreign drill bits, but they didn't work either. Finally, he was determined not to stop until he broke through this production key, and vowed to transform this standard drill bit recognized by countries all over the world.

Where to start? He picked up a worn-out drill bit, held it under the light and observed it carefully, and found that the tip and both corners of each used drill bit were burned. This phenomenon inspired his thinking, and he thought: "Why are each of the drill bits worn in the same place? Is it because the pressure is particularly high in these places, and one tip has a small area and cannot withstand it? Why not just grind them off a little to try?" He immediately ran to the grinding wheel, ground off the tip and both corners of the drill bit that had just been worn, turning it into a drill bit with three tips and seven cutting edges. He installed it on the drill bed, started the motor, and watched the drill bit drill into the odd hard steel plate. The hand-held rocker arm was also much lighter than before. In a short while, he drilled a smooth and round hole, and then drilled a few more holes, all smoothly. The more he looked at the improved drill bit, the more he felt it was right. He couldn't wait for the day to dawn and tell his master the good news.

Early the next morning, Ni Zhifu completely forgot the fatigue of working all night, and impatiently took his newly ground drill bit to Master Yu Shusen, and said excitedly: "Last night I figured out such a drill bit, and I finished the work!"

Master Yu took the drill bit and looked at it carefully, and said: "Good! Let's try it right away!" They went to the drill bed, installed the new drill bit, and drilled several holes in the thick steel plate, all drilling through happily. The old master shouted in surprise: "It works! This drill bit solves the big problem in our workshop." Many workers in the workshop came to watch. One said: "We don't have to worry about drilling steel anymore!" Another said: "This trick is good!"

This news immediately spread throughout the workshop. The workshop Party branch and director discussed and convened a meeting of work section chiefs and veteran workers, decided to summarize Ni Zhifu's experience in creating a new drill bit, and encouraged him: "Don't be afraid that your technical level is low. Look at how to grind the drill bit well and grind it like that, grind it to your most ideal shape." Ni Zhifu felt that with the Party's support, he became bolder and more confident. He didn't even want to eat or sleep every day. After work, he went to the scrap pile to find some scrap material to test the drill bit. Sometimes, he saw that the drill beds were busy during production time, so he simply waited to test at night. After continuous research for more than a month, with the help of Master Yu Shusen, repeated experiments, and multiple improvements, he finally figured out the grinding rules of his own created drill bit and determined the geometric shape of the new drill bit.

In our society, any person's little creation and innovation will be valued by the Party and the country, and every effort will be made to summarize it, to promote more people and innovators themselves to create new achievements, and to move towards greater victories. Ni Zhifu created a new type of drill bit. He only knew that it was easy to use and improved production efficiency, but he could not understand what scientific principles it contained. At this time, the factory Party and administrative organizations assigned engineers and teachers from the Metal Cutting Teaching and Research Group of the Beijing Institute of Technology to help him summarize his experience. After scientific identification and production practice proved that the drill bit created by Ni Zhifu has many advantages over the standard drill bits used internationally: it has high hardness resistance, not only drills holes quickly, but also extends the life of the drill bit, and is suitable for processing various steel materials; because the drill bit has three tips for positioning, the drilled holes are not easily skewed. After this identification, the relevant leading departments named it "Ni Zhifu Drill Bit." The emergence of this drill bit has opened up a new path for drilling work, rapidly improved production efficiency, and immediately became a major innovation in the mechanical industry.

"It is not good if one person is good, it is heroism if everyone is good." This great mind of the working class is also very clearly manifested in Ni Zhifu. His experience in creating new drill bits has been summarized. In order to introduce the experience, he has traveled to most of China in recent years, going to factories in Qiqihar, Shenyang, Chongqing, Wuhan, Xiangtan, Shanghai, and other places to deliver "treasures." If someone comes to the factory to learn from his experience, he can't wait to teach others everything at once, so that he and everyone can build the socialist motherland faster and better. Once, a worker from a machinery factory came to visit, and just happened to see Ni Zhifu doing drilling work. While watching, he exclaimed: "It's amazing, how can drilling be so fast?" Ni Zhifu immediately patiently explained the characteristics and grinding method of this new type of drill bit to them. These visiting workers were very happy. They said that their factory was encountering a batch of difficult work, and they were preparing to take this drill bit back to try it out immediately. Ni Zhifu stood in the workshop and sent them off, thinking secretly in his heart: "I hope this drill bit can really help them break through the production key." Soon, good news came. The factory adopted Ni Zhifu's drill bit experience and guaranteed the early completion of the production task. Another time, a fitter at the Chongwen Machinery Factory used the "Ni Zhifu drill bit" in the cast iron work of manufacturing long-pile velvet machine parts. The cutting amount was immediately more than doubled compared to ordinary drill bits, and the number of revolutions of the drill bed also increased by more than 60%. The time to drill one hole was shortened from one minute and twelve seconds in the past to twelve seconds, increasing efficiency by five times. In this way, Ni Zhifu's drill bit spread like wings to many factories in the country, and was also introduced to the Soviet Union. Workers at the Malyshev Factory in the Soviet Union used drill bits with a grinding geometric shape designed by Ni Zhifu when processing many parts of internal combustion engines, and the drilling speed increased by 1.5 times. When this news reached Ni Zhifu's ears, it encouraged him to be more determined to move forward and humbly study.

Once, Ni Zhifu went to a factory in Shanghai to introduce advanced experience, and the worker brothers warmly welcomed him. Suddenly, a young man squeezed out of the crowd, holding a split-chip drill bit created by workers in his factory, and said to him: "Shall we compare?" Ni Zhifu readily agreed. At this time, dense crowds stood on both sides, and everyone stared intently at the spinning drill bits in their hands. Only the roar of the machines was heard, and iron filings flew everywhere. It seemed that the two drill bits were really evenly matched. After a while, they both took out the drill bits for comparison. Ni Zhifu's drill bit was sparkling, complete and undamaged, but the blade of that drill bit had been worn. At this time, the young man stepped forward and shook his hand tightly, and said enthusiastically: "We must learn from you, learn from you:" Ni Zhifu also sincerely replied: "In fact, I also learned from you."

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued a great fighting call, and the people of the whole country set off a new high tide of the Great Leap Forward. At this time, Ni Zhifu also made up his mind to continue to improve his drill bit and make greater contributions to the implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction. One day, Ni Zhifu received a large number of iron plate drilling tasks. He decided to continue to improve his drill bit in practice. He took the drill bit and went to the fitter's bench to file it a few times, and then installed it on the drill bit to drill holes. He recalled the opinions and experiences of many worker comrades he had heard and seen in the promotion of experience. After repeated exploration and experimentation, he finally opened two chip splitting grooves on the drill bit and grinded the negative front angle into a positive angle. As a result, he completed this batch of drilling tasks ahead of schedule. He used this new drill bit to do a shift and didn't even grind it. Not long ago, teachers from the Beijing Institute of Technology conducted a preliminary scientific identification of the new drill bit improved by Ni Zhifu, proving that the life of this drill bit can be extended by about twice as long as the improved drill bit, and the cutting efficiency has been further improved. Whether it is steel or cast iron work, it can exert its power.

In the process of creating new drill bits, Ni Zhifu deeply realized that the Party's leadership and care, the encouragement of socialist construction achievements, and the wisdom and help of worker comrades are the endless source of promoting his creation and innovation. In 1958, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. His class consciousness was further improved. Under the leadership and support of the Party, he continued to manufacture an oil mark scribing disk, which made scribing without the need for a ruler or calculation, improving scribing efficiency by one to two times and accuracy to 0.05 mm; he created a small universal scribing table, which can accurately scribe various angles and directions without angle rulers and bending rulers. He also improved spray gun powder spraying, non-stop car head replacement tools, etc., replacing manual operation, to achieve rapid production. At present, he and his team have put forward the slogan of "Establishing lofty ambitions and aspirations, and acting as firm promoters," and are determined to bravely advance towards more ambitious goals.

    倪志福和他的钻头
    锣鼓响了，倪志福被人群簇拥着走出厂门，汽车的马达早已开动起来，党委书记郑绍宁还拉开车门紧紧握着他的手，亲热地说：“希望你到群英会上，把钻头的经验好好介绍出去，也盼望你学回更多的先进经验！”倪志福随着周围的掌声，一眼又看到工友们送来墨迹刚干的大喜报：“光荣啊！光荣，十月北京红旗飘，群英会师在一道……”这时，他觉得一股热力传遍了全身，创造钻头的许多往事一下都涌现在他的眼前。
    那是在1953年，倪志福这个在童年时就饱受旧社会折磨的青年工人来到了北京永定机械厂。面对着崭新的机器，规模巨大的厂房，态度亲切而又朝气勃勃的工厂、车间领导人和老师傅们；回想回想在帝国主义开办的工厂里当童工，以及后来在资本家工厂里做学徒忍饥挨饿受苦挨打的情形，这个二十多岁的青年怎能不对现实生活发生一股强烈的热爱，决心要用自己的双手更好地建设社会主义。从此，他见到什么就想学什么，恨不得一口气把世界上的技术都吞进肚里。从钳工台到机床旁，从车间到工厂夜校，到处都变成他学习的场所。他在衣服兜里总装着几张纸，见到老师傅干活有点突出的操作，马上记下来，发现“机械工人”等刊物上介绍的先进经验也抄下来，遇到大大小小的活，总是细心琢磨，想尽办法把活干得快些好些。有一次，倪志福所在的车间接到一批很伤脑筋的活，要在一种特殊的钢材上打眼。小伙子也好，老师傅也好，都用钳工惯用的“标准钻头”去啃，老半天打不出一两个眼，大家急得满头大汗，也找不出一个办法。这天夜班，倪志福又接着干这个活。他站在一人多高的摇臂钻前，两只眼睛死死地盯着旋转的钻头，一会儿就听到钻床发出“吱吱”的尖叫声，马上把钻头退下来，一看又磨损了一大块。一个眼没打透，钻头已经磨过好多次。他想，钻孔是机械工业中的主要工序之一，钻工不必说，钳工、车工、镗工等都有钻孔的活。这个标准钻头，不止咱们中国工人用，就是世界各国也都用它。现在，它却啃不动这样的硬料。他把磨损坏的钻头都拣到一起，呆呆地楞了一会儿，回头望望眼前成堆的活，耳边似乎听到党的号召：“这是一批紧急的生产任务，一定要尽快交活。”他咬咬牙，又鼓起了勇气干下去。午夜已过，第二班的工友都已经下班，有人来约他一道回去休息，可是他好像没有听见别人说话，头也不抬继续琢磨他的活。这时，他已经试用过师傅们祖辈传下来的平底钻头，打不动眼；又试用过外国的先进钻头，也不灵；最后他抱定不攻破这个生产关键誓不休的决心，一定要改造一下这个世界各国公认的标准钻头。
    从哪儿下手呢？他拿起磨坏的钻头，举在灯下仔细地观察，发现每个用过的钻头尖部和两角都被烧坏了。这个现象启发了他的思想，他想道：“为什么每个钻头都在同一地方被磨损呢？是不是这些地方的压力特别大，一个尖的面积小，承受不了，倒不如干脆把它们磨掉一点试试看。”他立刻跑到砂轮机边，把钻头上刚才被磨坏的尖部和两角都磨去，变成三个尖、七个刃的钻头，安在钻床上开动马达一试，眼看着钻头往奇硬的钢板钻进去，手扶的摇把也比以前轻快多了。一会工夫，打出一个又光又圆的眼，紧接着又打了几个眼，都挺顺利。他越看越觉得改进后的钻头对劲，恨不得一下子让天亮了，把这个喜讯告诉他师傅。
    第二天清早，倪志福完全忘了通宵干活的疲困，急不可待地拿着自己新磨出的钻头找到于树森师傅，兴冲冲地说：“昨晚我琢磨出这样一个钻头，把活干完了！”
    于师傅接过钻头仔细一瞧，说：“好啊！马上试试！”他们走到钻床前，安上新钻头在厚厚的钢板上连打几个眼，都痛痛快快地钻透了。老师傅惊喜地放开喉咙嚷了起来：“成呀！这个钻头解决了咱们车间的大问题。”车间好多工友都围上来看。这个说：“钢料打眼再不愁啦！”那个说：“这个窍门不错呀！”
    这个消息立即传遍了全车间。车间党支部和主任商量着召集工段长、老师傅开会，决定总结倪志福创造新钻头的经验，并且鼓励他说：“不要怕自己技术水平低，你看钻头怎样磨好就怎样磨，磨出你最理想的。”倪志福感到有党的支持，胆子更大了，信心更足了。每天饭也不想吃，觉也不愿睡，下班后就到废料堆里找些废料试验钻头。有时，他看到生产时间钻床都忙，索性就等夜晚试验。这样连续钻研了一个多月，在于树森老师傅的帮助下，反复地试验，多次地改进，他才摸索出自己创造的钻头磨制规律，把新型钻头的几何形状定下来了。
    在我们的社会里，任何人的点滴创造、革新都会受到党和国家的重视，千方百计把它总结起来，推动更多的人和革新者自己创造出新的成就，朝着更大的胜利前进。倪志福创造出新型的钻头，自己只知道好用，提高生产效率，却摸不透这里面包含着什么科学道理。这时，工厂党和行政组织指派工程师和北京工业学院派来的金属切削教研组的教师，共同帮助他总结经验。经过科学鉴定和生产实践证明：倪志福创造的钻头比国际上使用的标准钻头具有许多优点：耐硬度高，不但钻孔快，还能延长钻头的寿命，适合加工各种钢料；因为钻头上有三个尖来定位，钻出来的孔不易歪斜。经过这次鉴定后，由有关领导部门把它命名为“倪志福钻头”。这个钻头的出现，为钻孔工作开辟出一条新的道路，飞速提高了生产效率，立即成为机械工业中的一项重大的革新。
    “一个人好，不算好汉，大家都好，才是英雄。”这一工人阶级的伟大胸怀，在倪志福的身上也表现得十分鲜明。他创造新型钻头的经验总结出来了。为了介绍经验，几年来，他踏遍了大半个中国，到齐齐哈尔、沈阳、重庆、武汉、湘潭、上海等地工厂，登门送“宝”。如果有人到工厂来学习他的经验，他恨不得一下子把别人教会，让自己和大家一起把祖国的社会主义建设得更快更好。一次，有个机械厂的工人来参观，正赶上倪志福在干打眼的活，一边看一边惊叹地说：“真稀奇，打眼怎么这样快？”倪志福当即耐心地向他们讲解这个新型钻头的特点和磨法。这些参观的工人高兴极了。他们说自己厂里正碰到一批难做的活，准备马上拿这种钻头回去试试。倪志福站在车间送走他们时，心里暗暗想：“要是这个钻头真能帮助他们突破生产关键就好了。”不久，好消息果然传来了。那个工厂采用倪志福钻头的经验，保证提前完成了生产任务。又一次，崇文机械厂钳工在制造长毛绒机零件的铸铁活中试用了“倪志福钻头”，一下子吃刀量就比普通钻头提高一倍多，钻床的转数也增加60％以上，打一个眼的时间由过去的一分十二秒缩短到十二秒，提高效率五倍。就这样，倪志福的钻头像长了翅膀一样，在国内许许多多的工厂传播开来，同时也被介绍到苏联。苏联马利歇夫工厂的工人在加工内燃机的许多零件时，采用倪志福设计的刃磨几何形钻头，钻孔速度加快一点五倍。这些消息传到倪志福耳里，鼓舞着他更加立志前进，虚心钻研了。
    一次，倪志福到上海一个工厂去介绍先进经验，工人兄弟们热烈地欢迎他。突然从人群中挤出一个小伙子，拿着本厂工人创造的一把分屑钻头，对他说：“咱们比比看好吗？”倪志福欣然同意了。这时两旁站着密密麻麻的人群，大家都聚精会神地紧盯着他们两人手下飞旋的钻头，只听得机器声隆隆响，铁屑滚滚纷飞，看来两把钻头真是不相上下。不一会儿，他俩把钻头都退出一比较，倪志福的钻头亮晶晶的完整无损，可是那把钻头刀刃已经磨损了。这时，那个小伙子走向前紧紧握着他的手，满腔热忱地说：“我们一定向你学习，向你学习：”倪志福也诚恳地回答说：“事实上我也向你们学习了。”
    党的八届八中全会发出伟大的战斗号召，全国人民掀起跃进的新高潮。倪志福这时也下定决心继续改进自己的钻头，为贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线作出更大的贡献。有一天，倪志福接到一大批铁板的打眼任务。他便决定在实践中继续改进自己的钻头。他拿着钻头一会儿走到钳工台前锉几下，一会儿又安在钻头上打眼，他回忆起自己在推广经验中听到看到的许多工人同志的意见和经验，经过反复摸索、试验，终于在钻头上开出两道分屑槽，把负前角磨成了正角。结果，提前完成了这一批活的打眼任务。用这新钻头干了一班活，连磨也没磨。不久前，北京工业学院的教师们对倪志福改进后的新钻头又进行了初步的科学鉴定，证明这种钻头比改进前的钻头寿命可以延长一倍左右，切削效率得到进一步提高，不管钢料或铸铁活都能发挥出它的威力。
    在创造新钻头的过程中，倪志福深深地体会到党的领导与关怀，社会主义建设成就的鼓舞，以及工人同志们的智慧和帮助，是推动自己创造、革新的无穷无尽的源泉。1958年，他光荣地参加了中国共产党。他的阶级觉悟进一步提高，在党的领导和支持下，继续制造了一个油标划线盘，作到划线不用对尺、不用计算，使划线效率提高一至两倍，精度提高到零点零五毫米；造了小型万能划线台，不用角度尺和弯尺，就能准确地进行各种角度、方向的划线。他还改进出喷枪喷粉、不停车换卡头工具等，代替了手工操作，作到生产的快速化。目前，他和他的小组提出了“立雄心怀大志，作坚定的促进派”的口号，决心向着更远大的目标奋勇前进。　　　　孙世恺
