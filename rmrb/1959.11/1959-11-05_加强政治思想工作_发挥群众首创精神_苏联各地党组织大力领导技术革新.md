(Reported by Li Nan, our correspondent in Moscow, November 4) After the June Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, party organizations in various places immediately took action based on the resolutions of the plenary session, vigorously promoting automation and mechanization, carrying out supervision by grassroots party organizations, launching a campaign to tap potential, increase production and practice economy, strengthening organizational work and ideological and political work, and improving working methods. Relying on the enthusiasm of all party members and the pioneering spirit of the masses, focusing all efforts on implementing the resolutions of the June Plenary Session has become a distinct feature of the work of party organizations in various places.

In order to implement the resolutions of the June Plenary Session, party committees and meetings of party activists were convened in various places. Many more people than in the past, including thousands of advanced producers, innovators, inventors, and famous figures in science and technology, participated in these meetings. These meetings actually became places to creatively find measures and ways to increase production and practice economy, and to formulate plans to further complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

There are countless examples in this regard. The Kramatorsk Machine Factory in Ukraine proposed an initiative at the meeting of party activists to shorten the machine production process. Workers in Donbass formulated new plans at the party meeting to complete the steel production target two years ahead of schedule and the coal mine production target one year ahead of schedule of the Seven-Year Plan. The Almaty Oblast Party Activists Meeting called the automation and mechanization of production "virgin land in industry." At the meeting, everyone put forward many valuable suggestions for tapping internal potential. The party meeting in Novosibirsk Oblast formulated the automation and mechanization plan for the state: to install 200 mechanized continuous operation lines and 1,000 automatic and semi-automatic machines in the next few years.

After the June Plenary Session, the party organizations of various factories and enterprises became particularly active, and their leadership over production became more specific than in the past. For example, the party organization of the Bo Li Zhou Construction Trust launched an initiative for one engineer to lead two workers to participate in rationalization proposals. In a short period of time, the number of rationalization proposals doubled. The party organization of the Moscow Oblast Electrical Insulation Materials Factory launched an initiative to make the factory's various products exceed the world's best technical level in two to three years. The party organization of the Mogilev City Electric Motor Factory in Belarus mobilized the factory's designers and engineers to list all the problems that needed to be solved in the automation and mechanization of the production process, compiled them into a booklet, and handed them over to each worker for study. As a result, the automation work of the factory progressed rapidly. The production meeting in each workshop alone put forward more than 500 suggestions for technological progress.

Now, party organizations in various places have placed the issues of completing this year's and the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the automation and mechanization of technological progress, and strengthening the collaboration of various economic zones completely under the supervision of party organizations. The various supervisory committees of grassroots party organizations established in accordance with the central resolution are a powerful tool of the party organization. A large number of party activists were elected to these supervisory committees.

The party organizations of industrial enterprises and trade organizations in Moscow have formed 3,000 grassroots supervisory committees, with more than 16,000 Communist Party members participating in the grassroots supervision work. According to the experience of the past few months, these grassroots supervisory committees have become the core force of technological progress.

Another industrial center, Sverdlovsk Oblast, has 1,000 grassroots supervisory committees, with about 6,000 Communist Party members participating in the supervision work. The Ural Machine Factory is manufacturing the world's only fully automated steel rolling mill. The newly established supervisory committee immediately regarded this important work as an important object of supervision and closely assisted the progress of this manufacturing work.

Thousands of grassroots supervisory committees in various republics and autonomous republics have also begun to work. The Belarusian Republic has more than 1,200 supervisory committees, and the Bashkir Autonomous Republic has more than 990 grassroots supervisory committees. Under the leadership of the party organization, these supervisory committees widely absorb the participation of the vast number of workers and activists, and mass supervision has begun to be established. This supervision work is not only limited to supervising administration, but also supervises production competition, increasing production and practicing economy.

The June Plenary Session pointed out that after proposing calls and tasks, there must be meticulous organizational work and extensive political and ideological education work. After the plenary session, various republics successively convened plenary sessions of the Party Central Committee to specifically discuss organizational work and cadre work, and formulated methods to improve organizational work. Party organizations in various places often hold meetings to study the work style of cadres, improve work methods, and put forward strict requirements for cadres.

Recently, party organizations in various places have selected and dispatched a large number of cadres with organizational and political work ability to enrich lower-level institutions, especially in relatively backward areas. The Kherson Oblast Party Organization canceled the various departments of the Party Committee in order to allow party cadres to go to the lower levels frequently. Under the leadership of the party organization, many new forms of leadership connecting with the masses have emerged in various enterprises in Moscow. Some districts stipulate that all agencies receive the masses on the same day, and some factories stipulate that the factory director, party committee secretary, chief engineer, and chairman of the trade union go to the workshop to hold symposiums with workers, listen to workers' opinions, and answer various suggestions and questions raised by the masses one day a week.

Various places also pay special attention to the education of young party members. There are now 538,000 probationary party members in the Soviet Union and 969,000 party members who have been in the party for less than three years. After the party organization strengthened their education, young party members in various places enthusiastically joined the intense labor of comprehensively developing communist construction.

The movement initiated by Kaganova, a young probationary member of the CPSU, is developing day by day. The famous miner and representative of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, Mamai, has now worked in a backward work shift for more than a month. Another famous miner and Communist Party member, Kurmanov, gave up his vacation and decided to raise a backward work shift to an advanced level. Pozdnyakov and others, Communist Party members of the Moscow Ilyich Factory, initiated an initiative to comprehensively improve production. The purpose of this initiative is to make every worker an advanced producer. Four hundred young party members from the Dzerzhinsky Factory in Orenburg Oblast have contributed to technological progress and become advanced elements in production.

    加强政治思想工作　发挥群众首创精神
    苏联各地党组织大力领导技术革新
    本报莫斯科4日电　记者李楠报道：苏共中央六月全会后，各地党组织就立即根据全会决议行动了起来，大抓自动化和机械化工作，开展基层党组织的监督，掀起发掘潜力、增产节约的运动，加强组织工作和思想政治工作，改进工作方法。依靠全体党员的积极性，依靠群众的首创精神，把一切力量用来贯彻六月全会的决议，成了各地党组织工作的一个鲜明的特点。
    为执行六月全会决议，各地都召开了党组的全会、党的积极分子会议。参加这些会议的，有比过去多得多的，成千上万的生产先进者、革新家、发明创造家、科学和技术方面的著名人物。这些会议实际上就成了创造性的寻找增产节约的措施和途径，制订进一步提前完成七年计划的方案的场所。
    这方面的事例多得不胜枚举。乌克兰克拉玛托尔机器工厂在党的积极分子会议上提出了缩短机器生产程序的创议。顿巴斯的职工在党的会议上制订出了新的计划，钢铁生产提前两年，煤矿生产提前一年完成七年计划。阿拉木图州党的积极分子会议把生产自动化和机械化称为“工业上的处女地”，在会议上，大家提出了许多发掘内部潜力的宝贵的建议。在新西伯利亚州的党的会议上制订了这个州的自动化和机械化计划：要在最近几年内，安装二百部机械化连续工作线，一千部自动化和半自动化机器。
    各个工厂企业的党组织，六月全会以后，工作特别活跃，对生产的领导也比过去更具体。例如伯力州建筑托拉斯党组织发起一个工程师带动两个工人参加合理化建议的创议。短期内就使合理化建议的人数增加了一倍。莫斯科州电气绝缘材料工厂的党组织发起倡议，要在二年到三年内使工厂的各种产品都超过世界上最好的技术水平。白俄罗斯莫吉列夫城电动机工厂的党组织发动工厂的设计师工程师将生产过程中的自动化和机械化需要解决的问题一一列举出来，编印成册，交给每个工人研究，结果工厂的自动化工作迅速进展。仅各车间一次生产会议就提出了五百多条技术进步的建议。
    现在，各地党组织已把提前完成本年和七年计划问题，自动化机械化技术进步的问题，加强各经济区的协作问题完全置于党组织的监督之下。依照中央决议成立起来的基层党组织的各种监督委员会，就是党组织的一项有力工具。大批的党员积极分子被选进了这些监督委员会。
    莫斯科市各工业企业和贸易机构的党组织已经组成了三千个基层监督委员会，有一万六千多名共产党员参加了基层监督的工作。根据几个月来的经验，这些基层监督委员会已成了技术进步的核心力量。
    另一个工业中心斯维尔德洛夫斯克州已有一千个基层监督委员会，约六千共产党员参加了监督工作。乌拉尔机器工厂正在制造世界上唯一的完全自动化的轧钢机，新成立的监督委员会立刻把这一重要工作作为监督的重要对象，密切协助这一制造工作的进展。
    各加盟共和国、自治共和国的成千上万的基层监督委员会也都开始工作。白俄罗斯共和国已有一千二百多个监督委员会，巴什基尔自治共和国已有九百九十多个基层监督委员会。这些监督委员会在党组织的领导下，广泛吸收广大的职工积极分子参加，群众性的监督已开始建立起来。这些监督工作已不仅限于监督行政，而且对生产竞赛、增产节约都进行监督。
    六月全会指出，在提出号召和任务之后，必须紧接着有细致的组织工作和广泛的政治思想教育工作。全会以后，各加盟共和国都先后召开了专门讨论组织工作和干部工作的党中央全会，制订了改进组织工作的办法。各地党组织都经常开会，研究干部工作作风，改进工作方法，对干部提出严格的要求。
    最近各地党组织选派了大批有组织工作和政治工作能力的干部去充实下层机构，特别是还比较落后的地区。赫尔松州党组织取消了党委机关的各个部，以便党的干部经常到下层去。莫斯科市各个企业在党组织的领导下，出现了许多领导联系群众的新形式。有的区规定各机关在同一天接见群众，有的工厂规定每一星期有一天厂长、党委书记、总工程师、工会主席都到车间去和工人开座谈会，听取工人的意见，回答群众提出的各种建议和问题。
    各地还特别注意青年党员的教育工作。现在苏共有五十三万八千多预备党员，有九十六万九千入党不到三年的党员。在党组织加强对他们的教育后，各地青年党员纷纷热情地投入了全面开展共产主义建设的紧张劳动。
    年青的苏共预备党员加干诺娃发起的运动正在日益发展。著名的矿工，苏共二十一大的代表马玛依现在已在一个落后工作班内工作了一个多月。另一个著名矿工共产党员库尔曼诺夫放弃休假，决心要把一个落后的工作班提高到先进的水平。莫斯科伊里奇工厂共产党员波兹德里亚科夫等人发起全面改善生产的倡议，这一倡议的目的要使每个工人都成为先进的生产者。奥伦堡州捷尔任斯基工厂四百名青年党员都在技术进步中作了贡献，成为生产中的先进分子。
