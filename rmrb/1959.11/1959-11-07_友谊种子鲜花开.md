Seeds of Friendship Blossom into Flowers
By our staff reporter Sun Shikai

In the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital in Beijing, Soviet experts diligently sowed the seeds of friendship, which have now blossomed into brilliant flowers. Many medical personnel have armed themselves with advanced Soviet medicine and are shouldering the heavy responsibilities of medical work in various departments.

Thousands of Miles Delivering "Food"

Before the October Revolution Day, ophthalmologist Song Chen suddenly received a gift from expert Bahlge from Odessa. She opened it and was extremely excited to find it was full of the latest ophthalmology books published in the Soviet Union in 1959, a spiritual food she urgently needed!

Song Chen flipped through these beloved books, and couldn't help thinking: "Even after the experts return to their country, no matter where they go, they never forget us." Like other medical personnel in the hospital, she had forged a deep friendship with the Soviet experts. Whether it was expert Akimochkina, who returned home earlier, or expert Bahlge, who left Beijing just last spring, they have been concerned about Song Chen's growth since returning to the Soviet Union, frequently writing letters, sending books, and even enthusiastically answering some difficult questions she raised about scientific research and medicine. From these friendly exchanges, Song Chen deeply felt that although the Soviet experts lived thousands of miles away, she still received their kind guidance and encouragement as if they were by her side.

Although she studied ophthalmology in university, she had been engaged in surgery since taking up her job. When she came to this hospital and returned to ophthalmology, she felt that many medical practices were unfamiliar, and she couldn't help feeling a little timid. When expert Bahlge noticed her feelings, she constantly encouraged her, saying: "Precisely because you don't know, you need to practice!" Sometimes, when the expert checked the wards, she would also specifically ask her to follow, from the ward to the operating room, working and learning at the same time. After the Soviet experts left, Song Chen always followed the advanced medical ideas spread by the experts in her work, often treating diseases from the perspective of Pavlov's theory. Even though she was treating eye diseases, she had to consider the patient's overall condition, understand the patient's work situation and social life, and improve the medical effect.

"As a doctor, you must shoulder such responsibilities. Even if it is only a one-in-a-thousand benefit to the patient, we must treat them." Song Chen often cultivated the proletariat's medical viewpoints and style from expert Bahlge's words. When she encountered a patient with total corneal corrosive ulcer, although she felt that the expert had only taught partial lamellar keratoplasty in the past, she did not bow her head in the face of this difficulty. With the determination of "everything for the patient," she continued to study the advanced Soviet medical experience, and finally successfully performed total lamellar keratoplasty. Furthermore, for diseases such as large-area retinal detachment without tears or retinal detachment with multiple leaky holes, she tried every means to use eyeball shortening and plastic tube transplantation, solving the therapeutic effect that could not be achieved by electrocautery in the past, and restoring light to many patients with serious eye diseases.

On the eve of the October Revolution Day, Song Chen, looking back on the past and cherishing the present, wrote in an article with gratitude: "I can play the role of a small screw in ensuring the health of our people, and I must thank the Soviet government for its selfless assistance to our country, and thank the Soviet experts for their selfless help."

The Story of the Leather Bag

Surgeon Sun Yanqing always likes to carry his purple leather bag. It seems that there is nothing special about this ordinary leather bag, but he has always regarded it as a treasure. This leather bag gives him encouragement and often evokes his memories. More than two years ago, Soviet surgical expert Eurolava, before returning to her country, specially asked her lover to bring this leather bag from Moscow. At a farewell party, she personally gave it to Sun Yanqing and said enthusiastically: "I hope you will put the papers you have written in it and walk onto the podium for academic defense..." Now, he has not disappointed the expert's expectations. In this leather bag, he has put nearly five or six academic reports written in the past two years based on his own clinical experience.

This young physician, Sun Yanqing, is now able to independently perform very complex surgical operations such as heart surgery. When people praise his superb medical skills, he always says: "I grew up under the diligent training of Soviet experts!" From what ordinary people think is a modest tone, his true feelings are revealed. He came to the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital (the predecessor of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital) two years before graduating from the Beijing Medical College. At that time, he lacked clinical experience and his level of medical theory was low. Whenever an operation was performed, Soviet expert Nagnybeda always tried to get him to study. In the beginning, when the expert performed the operation, he let him be the first assistant. When he was able to perform the operation independently, the expert became his first assistant. Expert Nagnybeda was nearly sixty years old, but he was full of energy. He arrived at the office an hour before work every day, seized his spare time to organize Chinese medical personnel to read medical theory articles, and guided them to make medical literature summary cards. Sometimes, the old expert also extracted important chapters from his own dissertation and printed them out for everyone to study. His spirit of teaching tirelessly moved every medical staff member in his department. Sun Yanqing recalled these past events and said with infinite gratitude: "Under the guidance of Soviet experts, we not only rapidly improved our medical level in clinical aspects, but also cultivated our interest in reading and the habit of studying academic theories."

After the Soviet experts returned home, Sun Yanqing continued to carry forward the spirit of hard study and worked hard to improve his medical level. Now, he not only independently performs many complex thoracic and cardiac surgeries, all of which have achieved good results, but also constantly conducts scientific research. He uses hypothermia or an artificial heart-lung machine to perform direct-vision heart surgery. After the last set of animal experiments, he has achieved 90% success, reaching the requirements for clinical application. When the October Revolution Day arrived, he said excitedly: "I want to write a letter to tell our dear teacher about this new scientific research result."

The Feelings of a Revolutionary

Zhong Bo walked out of the otolaryngology operating room with a smile on his face. People knew at a glance that his "inner ear fenestration" surgery was successful. This is a complex operation in otolaryngology, which even experienced physicians with decades of experience generally did not dare to perform in the past. Now, it is undertaken by young physicians like Zhong Bo.

When the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital, the predecessor of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital, was born, Zhong Bo worked with Soviet experts. Under the guidance of Soviet experts Maltnova, Voskresensky, Yudina, and Zhukov, he had been trained into a skilled physician in a few years. The experts left him with decades of accumulated experience and research results, and also passed on a noble medical style. He still remembers the glorious example set by expert Zhukov. A patient whose trachea was pierced by Japanese imperialist elements had undergone more than ten operations in other hospitals without being cured and had endured eighteen years of pain. When the patient came to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital with a glimmer of hope, some medical personnel at the time expressed that they had no confidence in curing the disease. Expert Zhukov saw the hesitation in their accepting this patient, and immediately said with a very firm tone: "This patient sacrificed himself for our revolutionary cause, and we have a responsibility to take all measures to help him restore his health." After the patient was admitted to the hospital, a special medical team consisting of expert Zhukov, expert Yudina, and Zhong Bo was formed to carry out treatment. After three consecutive operations and more than two months of diagnosis and treatment, the long-term incurable injury was finally cured. The patient recovered his health and returned to work. Zhong Bo deeply realized from expert Zhukov's practical actions how much a doctor in our society needs to possess such strong class feelings of a revolutionary. He constantly uses these good examples left by the experts to spur himself on. In his medical work, he not only strives to improve his medical skills, but also pays more attention to strengthening his political cultivation and moves towards the path of being both red and expert.

    友谊种子鲜花开
    本报记者　孙世恺
    在北京中苏友谊医院里，苏联专家辛勤地播下了友谊的种子，现已开放出鲜艳的花朵。许多医务人员用苏联的先进医学武装了自己，肩负起各科室的医疗重任。
    万里送“食粮”
    在十月革命节前，眼科医师宋琛忽然接到巴尔格专家从敖得萨寄来的一份礼物。她打开一看，兴奋极了，全是1959年苏联最新出版的眼科书籍，这是她多么迫切需要的精神食粮啊！
    宋琛翻阅着这些心爱的书，情不自禁地想道：“专家回国后，尽管相隔万里，她们不论走到哪里也总忘不了我们。”她像医院里其他医务人员一样，和苏联专家结下了深厚的友谊。不论是早期归国的阿基莫其基娜专家，还是去年春天刚刚离开北京的巴尔格专家，她们回到苏联以后一直关心宋琛的成长，经常写信、寄书，甚至还在信中热情地解答她提出的有关科学研究和医学上的一些疑难问题。从这些友谊的来往中，使宋琛深深感到苏联专家虽然远居万里，仍然像在自己的身旁一样，经常得到亲切的指导，也受到鼓舞。
    她在大学时虽然学的眼科，走上工作岗位却一直担任外科业务。当她来到这个医院时，又重新走进眼科，感到许多医疗工作都生疏，心中不免有些胆怯。巴尔格专家发现她这种心情，就不断鼓励说：“正因为你不会，所以才需要锻炼啊！”有时专家查病房，也特意叫她跟着，从病房到手术室，一边工作，一边学习。苏联专家走后，宋琛在工作中，始终遵循着专家所传播的先进医学思想，经常以巴甫洛夫学说的观点来对待疾病，尽管诊治的是眼病，也要从病人的全身去考虑，了解病人的工作情况和社会生活，提高了医疗效果。
    “作医生要肩负起这样的责任，哪怕对病人只有千分之一的好处，我们也要去治疗。”宋琛经常从巴尔格专家这些言谈中，培养起无产阶级的医疗观点和作风。当她遇到全角膜蚕蚀性溃疡病患者时，虽然感到过去专家只教过部分的板层角膜移植术，也没有在这个困难面前低头，抱定“一切为了病人”的决心，继续钻研苏联的先进医学经验，终于施以全板层角膜移植术获得成功。继而又对没有裂孔的大面积视网膜剥离或多数漏孔状的视网膜剥离等疾病，都千方百计地采用眼球缩短及塑料管移植术，解决了过去只作电烙凝固术所不能达到的治疗效果，让许多患有严重眼疾的病人，恢复了光明。
    宋琛在十月革命节前夕，追今抚昔，满怀感激的心意在一篇文章中这样写道：“在保证我国人民健康的事业上，我能发挥一个小螺丝钉的作用，不能不感谢苏联政府对我国的无私援助，感谢苏联专家的无私帮助。”
    皮包的故事
    外科医师孙衍庆总喜欢携带他那个紫色的皮包。看来这个普通的皮包并没有什么特别的地方，但他却一直视为珍品。这个皮包给予他鼓舞，也经常引起他的回忆，两年多以前，苏联外科专家欧罗拉瓦在归国前托他爱人特意从莫斯科带来这个皮包，在一次欢送会上亲手送给了孙衍庆，同时热情地对他说：“希望你装进自己写下的论文，走上学术答辩的讲台上……”现在，他没有辜负专家的期望，在这个皮包里已装过他近两年根据自己临床经验写出的五、六篇学术报告。
    孙衍庆这个青年医师现已能够独立进行心脏手术等十分复杂的外科手术了。当人们称赞他的高超医术时，他总这样说：“我是在苏联专家辛勤培养下成长起来的！”从一般人认为这句谦虚的语气中，确实流露出他的真心实情。他来到北京苏联红十字医院（中苏友谊医院的前身）前两年多，刚从北京医学院毕业。那时，他既缺乏临床经验，医学理论水平又低。每逢作手术，苏联专家纳格尼别达总是想尽办法让他去学习。开始专家作手术，让他当第一助手，等他能独立进行手术时，专家又当他的第一助手。纳格尼别达专家已近六十高龄，但他的精力充沛，每天上班前一个小时就赶到办公室，抓紧业余时间组织我国医务人员阅读医学理论文章，并指导他们作出医学文献提要卡片。有时，老专家还把自己写的学位论文摘出重要章节打印出来，让大家学习。他这种诲人不倦的精神，感动了他们科里每个医务人员。孙衍庆缅怀这些往事，带着无限感激的心情说：“在苏联专家的指导下，我们不仅从临床方面迅速提高了医疗水平，还培养了读书的兴趣和钻研学术理论的习惯。”
    孙衍庆在苏联专家回国后，继续发扬了刻苦钻研的精神，努力提高自己的医疗水平。现在，他不仅独立进行许多胸部和心脏的复杂手术，都获得良好的效果，还不断地进行科学研究。他利用低温或人工心脏机作直视心脏手术，经过最后一组动物试验已取得90％的成效，达到了临床应用的要求。当十月革命节到来时，他兴奋地说：“我要写信把这项新的科学研究成果，告诉我们亲爱的老师。”
    革命者的感情
    钟波走出耳鼻喉科手术室，面带笑容。人们一望而知他作的“内耳开窗”手术成功了。这是耳鼻喉科一项复杂的手术，过去连有几十年经验的老医师一般也不敢进行。现在却由钟波这样青年医师担任起来了。
    在中苏友谊医院的前身北京苏联红十字医院诞生时，钟波就和苏联专家在一起工作。在苏联专家玛尔特诺娃、沃斯克利新斯基、尤金娜和朱可夫的指导下，几年功夫已把他培养成一个熟练的医师。专家们给他留下了数十年积累的经验和研究的成果，也传下了高尚的医疗作风。他至今还念念不忘朱可夫专家树立下的光辉榜样。有位曾被日本帝国主义分子刺破喉头气管的患者，在其他医院经过十多次手术都未治愈，忍受了十八年的痛苦。当病人抱着一线希望赶到中苏友谊医院，当时有些医务人员表示没有信心能治好这个病。朱可夫专家看出他们接受这个病人表现出犹豫的心情，立即怀着十分坚定的口吻说：“这个患者是为了我们的革命事业牺牲了自己，我们有责任采取一切办法，帮助他恢复健康。”病人入院后，由朱可夫专家、尤金娜专家和钟波等组成了专门医疗小组展开治疗，连续进行三次手术，经过两个多月的诊治，终于治好这个久治不愈的病伤。病人恢复了健康，重新走上了工作岗位。钟波从朱可夫专家这个实际行动中深深体会到，在我们的社会里，作为一个医生是多么需要具备革命者这种强烈的阶级感情。他时刻以专家留下的这些良好范例来鞭策自己，在医疗工作中，不仅努力提高医学技术，更注意加强政治修养，向又红又专的道路上迈进。
