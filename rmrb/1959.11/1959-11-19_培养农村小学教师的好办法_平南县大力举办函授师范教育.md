Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 18th. Pingnan County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is vigorously developing correspondence primary and secondary normal education to train and improve teachers for the popularization of education in rural areas, and has achieved remarkable results.

At present, 856 primary school teachers in the county are participating in elementary normal correspondence courses, and 1,048 are participating in secondary normal correspondence courses, with 14 classes each for elementary and secondary normal courses. Every primary school has established a self-study group, with a total of 198 self-study groups in the county.

The county's experience proves that correspondence education is an effective method for rapidly training and improving the cultural and professional level of in-service primary school teachers in rural areas where there are few full-time teachers. Teachers can both do their work well and improve their teaching ability while studying on the job. Studying while working enables teachers to closely link their studies with practice and improve the quality of teaching. At present, more than 370 in-service primary school teachers in the county have completed the language and arithmetic courses at the elementary normal correspondence school. Pan Jinren, a teacher at Damiao Central Primary School, had difficulty teaching elementary school arithmetic before participating in correspondence courses. Now he can teach senior primary school arithmetic and has become an excellent arithmetic teacher in the school. Many teachers have improved their teaching quality after studying teaching methods, education, and psychology courses at the correspondence school, making their teaching methods diverse, flexible, and suitable for the needs of students at all grade levels.

In terms of curriculum arrangement, the elementary and secondary normal correspondence courses adopt the method of advancing one subject at a time and completing subjects separately, so that students can concentrate on studying each subject well. In terms of teachers, the method of combining those who are capable as teachers with full-time teachers is adopted. Full-time teachers prepare lessons collectively in advance, write detailed lesson plans, and distribute them to part-time teachers for reference, ensuring the quality of correspondence teaching.

In terms of teaching methods and time arrangement, the elementary normal class adopts the method of "more lectures and more practice, combining lectures and practice," lecturing once every three weeks, with six lectures and practice sessions in the whole semester, strengthening tutoring after class so that students can learn sequentially. The secondary normal class adopts the method of "concise lectures and more practice," lecturing once a month, with three lectures in the whole semester, focusing on guiding self-study.

    培养农村小学教师的好办法
    平南县大力举办函授师范教育
    新华社南宁18日电　广西僮族自治区平南县大力举办函授初、中级师范教育，为农村普及教育培养、提高师资，取得显著成绩。
    目前，全县小学教师参加初级师范函授学习的达八百五十六人，参加中级师范函授学习的有一千零四十八人，初级师范、中级师范各十四班，每个小学校都成立一个自学小组，全县共有一百九十八个自学小组。
    这个县的经验证明：函授教育是在专职教师少的情况下，快速培养、提高农村在职小学教师文化业务水平的有效方法。教师在职学习，既能把工作做好，又能提高教学能力；边工作边学习，能使教师的学习很好地联系实际，提高教学质量。目前，全县已有三百七十多名在职小学教师在初级师范函授学校的语文、算术两科结业。大妙中心小学教师潘进仁，没有参加函授学习前担任初小算术课还很吃力，现在已能教高小算术，并且成为全校的优秀算术老师。许多教师在函授学校学习了教学法、教育学、心理学等课程后，教学方法多样、灵活，适合各年级学生需要，从而提高了教学质量。
    函授初级师范和中级师范在课程安排上，采取单科前进，分科结业办法，使学员集中精力逐科学习好。在教师方面，采取能者为师，专职教师与兼职教师相结合的办法，由专职教师事先集体备课，写出比较详细的教案发给兼职教员参考，保证了函授教学质量。
    在教学方法和时间的安排上，初级师范班采取“多讲多练、讲练结合”的办法，每隔三周讲授一次，全学期讲练六次，课后加强辅导，学员可以循序学习；中级师范班“精讲多练”，每月讲授一次，全学期讲授三次，着重指导自学。
