Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th (TASS): Moscow held a celebration rally for the forty-second anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution at the Lenin Central Stadium Sports Palace on the 6th. Aristov, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Secretary of the Central Committee, delivered a report on the forty-second anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution at the celebration rally. The full text of the report is as follows:

	Comrades! Forty-two years ago, a great event shook the world. In Russia, the Great October Socialist Revolution was victorious. The world imperialist front was breached. Workers and peasants, under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, overthrew the rule of capitalists and landlords and established Soviet power. For the first time in world history, working people and the exploited people gained genuine human rights and freedom and became masters of their own destiny.

	The October Revolution liberated all nationalities in our country from social and national oppression. It broke the shackles on the productive forces and opened up a never-ending source of vitality, from which the Soviet people drew endless strength, becoming stronger and richer. The socialist revolution opened up unlimited possibilities for working people to freely exert their talents, wisdom, and genius. It handed over the power of the state to the working people and led them onto the broad road of the magnificent socialist transformation.

	Today, we celebrate the forty-second anniversary of the Great October Revolution. Looking back on the path we have traveled over the years, we can proudly say that our heroic people have transformed their country into a powerful socialist nation and have achieved accomplishments that are praised by all progressive humanity.

	The Great Creative Power of the Socialist Revolution

	Comrades! Over the past forty-two years, the Soviet people have traveled a difficult and long road. In the early years of the revolution, the young Soviet Republic was attacked by the huge armies of domestic counter-revolutionaries and foreign armed interventionists. The enemy imposed a civil war on us, making it impossible for us to engage in peaceful and creative labor for several years.

	The Soviet state suffered great sacrifices. In the struggle for the freedom of the motherland and the happiness of the working people, many famous revolutionaries and thousands upon thousands of outstanding sons and daughters of the people gave their lives. Armed interventionists and White Guards occupied extremely important areas within the country. They wanted to strangle us. However, the Soviet people were not intimidated, nor did they surrender. Lenin's voice, the voice of the Bolsheviks, united our strength and inspired us to fight for the just cause, for the great cause of the revolution. At that time, under the enemy's fire, the people established a new system and consolidated their Soviet state.

	Our people overcame enormous difficulties through their heroic labor, and by 1927, they had completely restored the damaged economy. Then, they used fifteen years to eliminate the economic backwardness left behind by generations, establish a powerful industry, large-scale mechanized agriculture, and broadly unfold cultural construction. Because the Party implemented Lenin's wise national policy, the nationalities, who had suffered oppression for generations, reached the level of advanced nationalities in a short period of time. Prosperous union republics and autonomous republics were established here.

	At the beginning of World War II, the Soviet Union had caught up with highly developed European capitalist countries in the production of important industrial products. When Fascist Germany treacherously attacked the Soviet Union, our economy was able to guarantee the supply of everything necessary for the Soviet army to defeat the enemy during the war.

	This war brought us great losses and destruction. It took the lives of millions of people—our fathers, brothers, sons, and daughters, the glorious patriots of our socialist motherland. It also brought great sacrifices and suffering to the women of our country. The Fascist bandits carried out mad destruction as they retreated, burning down cities, villages, factories, collective farms, and state farms. The years of the Great Patriotic War were the most severe test for us. However, our people, closely united around the Communist Party, withstood this test, defeated the enemy, and defended the fruits of the Great October Revolution.

	The Soviet people only used five or six years to rebuild cities and villages from the ruins, heal the wounds of the war, and begin construction and development of industry, agriculture, and culture with even more enthusiasm, improving the welfare of the working people. Despite the extremely severe tests that fell upon the Soviet people, the Communist Party—Lenin's Party—was good at arousing the working people and strengthening their confidence in their own strength, and confidence in the inevitable victory of communism, enabling them to perform real miracles!

	Comrades! Lenin once pointed out that our revolution, in its essence, is a constructive revolution. He said: "In any socialist revolution, and therefore also in the socialist revolution which we began in Russia on October 25, 1917, the main task of the proletariat and the poorest peasants it leads is to carry out positive, that is, constructive work."

	The enemies of socialism once maliciously slandered the October Revolution, saying that it was a blind, spontaneous force that could only bring destruction. Former British Ambassador to Russia, Buchanan, wrote in his memoirs that the Bolsheviks "are merely a destructive force, not a creative force. They are good at destroying, but not at all at restoring." Bourgeois liars spread this absurd slander in every corner of the world. They slandered the Bolsheviks and the Soviet people with malicious words. In our era, such people have not disappeared, and they continue to engage in this shameful act. According to old folk superstitions, these slanderers will be thrown into a boiling oil pot in hell after they die. We believe that for some of the current slanderers, it is better to be thrown into a boiling oil pot in this life.

	Of course, the working people of our country had to carry out destructive work on the road to the great goal. However, this was only to carry out cleaning work in eliminating the dross that was decaying and hindering the progress of society. The old world would not surrender without a fight. The enemies of the revolution put up a desperate resistance, and therefore, they were destroyed by the power of the people.

	The Communist Party, Lenin believed that destroying the old and outdated things is a necessary condition for establishing a new, progressive, and just social system. This is the most important characteristic of the Great, People's Creative Revolution - the October Revolution.

	No matter how our enemies try to slander the socialist system, life irrefutably proves that the Soviet people are realizing their plans and wishes through peaceful and creative labor, rather than through war and expansion. The socialist system, built by the efforts of millions of workers, does not need to be promoted and established by coercive means. This system has paved the way for itself because it conforms to the fundamental interests of the people and the urgent needs of social historical development. It elevates human dignity as the most valuable thing, ensuring that the people fully and comprehensively exert their talents to engage in peaceful labor.

	The free labor of people under the new social system arouses creative forces everywhere, creating more and more means of livelihood, and bringing prosperity to all sectors of the national economy and culture. The powerful attraction of communist ideas to hundreds of millions of people around the world lies in this.

	Comrades! The 21st Congress of the Party declared that socialism has not only completely triumphed, but has also thoroughly triumphed, and our motherland has entered a new stage of development—the period of comprehensively building a communist society. The historical resolutions of the Congress and Comrade Khrushchev's report defined the main tasks of the Party and the people in our new stage of development, and formulated a magnificent program for communist construction. Now the Soviet people are concentrating all their wisdom and strength to accelerate our progress and to complete the seven-year plan for developing the national economy ahead of schedule. It should be noted with great satisfaction that this year the working people of our country are welcoming the Great October Revolution Day with particularly pleasant feelings.

	At the just-concluded session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the economic construction this year was preliminarily summarized, and our achievements in international affairs were summarized.

	The representatives of the various republics who spoke at the meeting talked about the achievements of the working people of our country in striving to achieve the plan for the first year of the seven-year plan. They said that the cause of each republic is going very smoothly, and life is becoming more and more pleasant and happy. The representatives said that the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the resolutions of the June Plenary Session of the Central Committee on technological progress are being smoothly implemented; new technologies, comprehensive mechanization and automation—the most important basis for continuously improving labor productivity—are being promoted in the national economy at an accelerating pace.

	The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union adopted the plan for developing the national economy in 1960. This plan stipulates that the growth of industrial output will greatly exceed the growth in the second year of the seven-year plan that was initially planned. Life has put forward good corrections.

	We regard the new achievements of Soviet industry as the fruitful results of reorganizing the management of industry and construction. The work experience of the National Economic Council confirms that our socialist production speed has been significantly accelerated in all economic indicators. Here is the foresight of the Party Central Committee, because it formulated and implemented fundamental measures to improve the leadership of industry and construction. It must be pointed out once again that the anti-Party group opposed the reorganization of production management, which shows how divorced from life and how short-sighted the anti-Party group was. If it were not exposed and crushed in time, it would have brought great harm to our national economy.

	New achievements have also been made in developing agriculture this year. Although some areas of our country have experienced drought, this year's grain harvest is still more than the largest bumper harvest year before the reclamation of wasteland. As of November 1, the total grain procurement volume of the country was 825 million poods more than the average procurement volume from 1949 to 1953. This year's crop harvest can fully guarantee the various needs of the country.

	The characteristic of agriculture in 1959 is: the development of publicly owned animal husbandry is faster. The establishment of a solid feed base, especially the increase in the production of corn silage, has played an important role in the development of animal husbandry.

	The rural workers in the friendly family of all nationalities in the Soviet Union greeted the forty-second anniversary of the October Revolution with great achievements. On the eve of the great festival, the glorious agricultural workers of the Ukrainian Republic reported good news to the Central Committee of the Party and the Soviet government: they completed the plan to sell grain, meat, milk and other products to the state ahead of schedule, and realized the guarantee to sell grain to the state beyond the plan, which made all of us happy. The collective farmers of the Tajik, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Turkmen and Azerbaijan republics have achieved a bumper harvest of cotton. The state farms and collective farms in Kazakhstan have made great achievements in grain production and animal husbandry development on the newly cultivated land. This year, the labor achievements of the orchard, tea plantation and vineyard workers in Georgia, Armenia, and Moldova, as well as the livestock breeders and flax growers in Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, are also very good.

	The workers in the Urals, Bashkir, Tatar, Kuban, many regions of Siberia, the Volga River basin, and other regions of the Russian Federation have successfully completed the guarantee of selling grain, animal products, vegetables, and fruits to the state. Everyone knows clearly the outstanding initiative of the livestock breeders in Ryazan Oblast. They have completed the two-year plan for selling meat to the state and guaranteed that they will complete the third-year plan by the end of the year. Completing the three-year plan in one year while increasing the total number of livestock is indeed selfless labor worthy of great praise.

	All of this convincingly illustrates the great significance of the resolutions passed by the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU in 1953 and other resolutions of the Party and the government on the development of agriculture, and the fruitful results achieved by the measures implemented in recent years, especially in the reclamation of wasteland and the development of animal husbandry. It is impossible not to point out that Ni. Xie. Khrushchev is recognized by all the people of our country for his special contribution in this regard.

	Every Soviet person feels the great achievements of our country's agriculture in daily life. But we still have much work to do to increase agricultural production and raise backward collective farms and state farms to advanced collective farms and state farms. Now, Party organizations and workers at all levels in rural areas are actively preparing to welcome the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which will discuss the issue of further developing agriculture.

	The first year of the seven-year plan has achieved great achievements in improving the material welfare of the Soviet people. Measures to increase the production of consumer goods have recently been formulated and are being implemented. The state's appropriations for the cultural life needs and social support of the working people have greatly increased. The income of workers, peasants, and staff members is increasing year by year.

	Especially in recent years, the consumption of some of the most important foods in our country has been growing rapidly. Compared with 1952, the sales volume of meat and meat products in state and cooperative trade has increased by more than two times, milk and dairy products have increased by more than three times, animal fats have almost increased by one and a half times, and sugar has almost increased by one time. Comrades, this means that the table of every Soviet family is displaying more and more kinds of foods.

	But we know that more consumer goods should be produced so that these products can be fully abundant in the near future. The Party and the government attach great importance to this task.

	We have made great achievements in residential construction. This year, more than 80 million square meters of housing will be built in cities and workers' residential areas. The Third Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union adopted a plan to build 101 million square meters of housing in 1960, which will make it possible to ensure that more workers get housing.

	When greeting the forty-second anniversary of the October Revolution, the people of our country have also made many new achievements in the development of culture. The Party and the government's resolution on reforming the national education system is being smoothly implemented. Schools at all levels and scientific research institutions have strengthened their ties with life and production, which has had a good impact on improving the quality of training specialized talents and further developing science and technology, and has created good conditions for conducting communist education for the growing generation.

	Our country is generally recognized as the world's advanced in national education and scientific and technological achievements. Due to the creative thinking and selfless labor of Soviet scientists, engineers, designers, and workers, the Soviet Union is ahead of other countries in exploring the universe, and we cannot but be proud of this. The glory of launching the first artificial earth satellites and space rockets, the first "small moons," belongs to us.

	Our socialist country develops science for the benefit of all the people. We hope that science can lighten people's labor, beautify world life, and help to make the fullest use of all natural wealth and resources for the benefit of society. Therefore, Soviet scientists are aware of their great responsibilities in their work, their labor is highly evaluated, and they are cared for and loved by the people of our country.

	Comrades! The further the Soviet people go along the road to communism, the more actively and consciously hundreds of millions of workers participate in social production, and the more socialist democracy is promoted. The development of large-scale socialist competitions, the establishment of communist labor teams, the outstanding patriotic achievements of textile worker Kaganova and many other production innovators, and the glorious initiative of Ryazan's agricultural workers in accelerating the development of animal husbandry all illustrate the improvement of labor enthusiasm, and the infinite loyalty of the working class, collective farmers, and intellectuals to the cause of communism.

	In our country, the role of all social organizations, especially the Communist Youth League and trade unions, in building a new society is constantly growing, and the broad masses of the people are increasingly actively participating in the management of state affairs. Whether it is a Soviet representative, or a participant in a production meeting that cares about adopting new technologies, improving production, and paying attention to saving, or a picket who fights to make the order of socialist public life obeyed, the Soviet people play the role of the real masters of the country in all these aspects.

	In the Soviet Union, communist construction has become everyone's daily practice. Under such circumstances, caring about improving the level of communist consciousness and cultivating the noble moral qualities of our people should become a top priority task. This requires us to more closely link life with all ideological work, and improve the role of literature, art, and all cultural institutions in cultivating the spirit of the working people to actively fight for communism.

	The Soviet people know how great the achievements of our country are, and they are justly proud of these achievements. But, as in the past, the Party teaches us to be humble, not to be satisfied with the achievements that have already been made, to boldly expose the shortcomings in our work, and to correct these shortcomings in a timely manner. The Party requires those who hold leadership positions and all our cadres, no matter what department they work in, to constantly enrich their knowledge, improve their theoretical level, care about and pay attention to the needs of the working people, cherish their high trust, and not let them down. We should unremittingly strengthen the unity of the Party and the people, which is the guarantee of all our victories.

	The Victory of Lenin's Ideas of Peace and Friendship Among All Peoples

	Comrades! No other event in human history has had such a great impact on the entire course of world development as the October Revolution. The October Revolution, for the first time, opened up a reliable path for the people of all countries to fight for freedom, for lasting peace, and for socialism. We are happy to be advancing along the road to communism with the working people of all countries belonging to the socialist world system. All socialist countries in Europe and Asia are victoriously building a new life. On the day of the forty-second anniversary of the October Revolution, the Soviet people extend warm congratulations and best wishes to the fraternal people of socialist countries.

	The Soviet Union and other socialist countries are winning the favor of working people all over the world year by year with the power of their example. Comrades, we believe that such a period will surely come: at that time, people of all countries will happily cheer for the happiness of their contemporaries, and gratefully remember the name of Lenin, the Bolsheviks—the first founders of the Great October Socialist Revolution, and all those who built a new life and defended the great cause of communist construction with arduous struggle and tireless labor.

	Comrades! The Soviet state was born under the banner of peace and friendship among all peoples. The first worker-peasant government believed that its sacred duty was to firmly oppose imperialist wars and to give justice and lasting peace to the people of all countries. In his report on peace at the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets on November 8, 1917, Lenin said: "The issue of peace is the most urgent and pressing issue at the moment."

	Thanks to the efforts of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries and all peace-loving forces, the international situation has recently improved significantly. The working people are greeting this great October festival with a better prospect of strengthening world peace.

	The growth of the power of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries and the improvement of international influence are the main reasons for the recent changes in favor of peace. A new peaceful scene has now been formed. The ideas of the October Revolution have enabled socialism to triumph and become established in a series of European and Asian countries with more than one billion residents. The principles of proletarian internationalism, equality and friendship among all peoples, and fraternal mutual assistance, which were declared by the October Revolution, are the unbreakable foundation of the socialist family of nations. The socialist world system has abundant resources and steadfastly pursues a policy of peace, so its existence creates a strong barrier to the forces of aggression and war. Now, more and more people in capitalist countries see that the growth of socialist forces is the growth of peaceful forces.

	The last foundation of the imperialist colonial system is collapsing due to the continuous new victories of the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Imperialists are doing everything possible to hinder the development of countries that have embarked on national independence and freedom. However, despite the various conspiracies of the imperialists, the people of all countries fighting for their freedom and national independence will surely win. Rights and justice are on their side!

	Our Party and government consistently adhere to the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence with countries with different social systems in their foreign policy.

	In fact, would a country that has eliminated the exploiting classes who are keen on the arms race and seizing other countries' territories, forcing other countries to submit to their exploitation, advocate war? Do the people who have realized the generations of ideals of the working people—becoming the masters of all the material wealth and spiritual wealth of their country—need war? Vladimir Ilyich said: "The workers and peasants of Russia cherish peace and happiness the most."

	V.I. Lenin deeply demonstrated the policy of peaceful coexistence. He said that the Soviet state must live with different countries, must coexist peacefully for the benefit of the people of all countries, maintain good-neighborly relations, and continuously expand political, economic, and cultural ties. Lenin's policy of peaceful coexistence has been further demonstrated and developed in our Party's resolutions and in Comrade Khrushchev's reports and speeches.

	People of all countries call the visit of the head of the Soviet government to the United States a great mission of peace and friendship. All of us Soviet people discussed the results of this historic visit with great pleasure. Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States was an extremely significant international event, which attracted the attention of the world's public. This is understandable, because this visit is related to peace, and related to the fate of all mankind. Our people sincerely extended a hand of friendship to the American people through the head of the Soviet government. This has been well received by the vast majority of the American people, who have apparently become tired of the "Cold War" and have begun to realize the fatal consequences that the "Cold War" may cause.

	The proposal for comprehensive and thorough disarmament made by N.S. Khrushchev on behalf of the Soviet government at the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly is a highly humanitarian and concrete peace program, which has penetrated deeply into the hearts of people of all countries. Everyone knows that the Soviet proposal is a complete program for realizing disarmament under strict international supervision.

	The issue of disarmament is the main and most urgent issue of mankind today. Precisely for this reason, the Soviet Union's program for comprehensive and thorough disarmament put forward at the United Nations has been warmly welcomed by peace-loving people and has brought great hope to mankind. Hundreds of millions of people see a realistic path to ensuring lasting peace in this clear program. We firmly believe that healthy ideas will triumph sooner or later, and mankind will eventually embark on the road of comprehensive and thorough disarmament.

	N.S. Khrushchev's historic visit to the United States provides us with an example, a vivid example, which points out how Communists and the Soviet people should practically realize the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

	How much he loved the motherland, how proud he was of the motherland and the people of the country, and how dignified he was, in his speeches to the American people! The Soviet people expressed admiration and gratitude for this. His passionate speeches calling for peace aroused great interest among millions of ordinary Americans. He firmly defended the communist faith, and even those who were hostile and opposed to socialism had to listen to his speeches with respect. The speeches of the head of the Soviet government in the United States expressed the thoughts and aspirations of hundreds of millions of Soviet people, embodied their great spirit and firm will, and expressed their true desire for peace and friendship among all peoples.

	Due to this visit, we have many new friends in the United States, who heard the truth about our country for the first time from the head of the Soviet government. Due to this visit, the position of peace-loving people has been greatly consolidated, and a new and powerful force has joined the ranks of the army striving to consolidate peace.

	The hope of the people of all countries that a new war can be avoided has been strengthened, and this hope is not so easy to eliminate. A new era has arrived. Every honest person cherishes the lofty ideas of peace, and these ideas will eventually triumph!

	Precisely for this reason, all Soviet people, working people of other countries, and progressives use so many heartfelt and sincere words to express their gratitude to the Soviet government, and to the tireless fighter for international peace—N.S. Khrushchev.

	The struggle for lasting peace will remain a long-term struggle in the future. In order to eliminate all the consequences of the "Cold War," it will take a lot of effort and time. In order to hinder the further relaxation of international tensions, the Western reactionary forces have recently been carrying out rampant activities. However, we hope that the people of the world will not be fooled by the notorious propagandists of the "Cold War." Peace-loving people should not relax their vigilance against the conspiracies of the reactionaries, but should be prepared to seize the hands of those madmen who dare to ignite new fires of war in a timely manner. Therefore, as long as the danger of war still exists, the Communist Party and the government believe that its future responsibility remains to be concerned about improving the Soviet armed forces that defend the peaceful labor of our people.

	Comrade Khrushchev's report "On the International Situation and Soviet Foreign Policy" at the Third Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is an extremely important political document at present, which will occupy a prominent position in the history of the Soviet people's struggle to defend the cause of peace.

	This report makes a deep analysis of the international situation, shows the improvement of the Soviet Union's prestige, and convincingly clarifies the achievements made by consistently implementing the policy of peace and creatively applying and developing Lenin's ideas on peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Further studying the issue of peaceful coexistence and the various forms of realizing peaceful coexistence at present is conducive to maintaining and consolidating peace.

	Our Party and government believe that their responsibility is to adhere to such a policy: from the relaxation of the international situation that has already been achieved to the complete elimination of tensions, and to the consolidation of world peace. This policy, which has been demonstrated in Comrade Khrushchev's report and unanimously approved by the session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, is also supported and endorsed by all Soviet people and all peace-loving people. The many reactions in the majority of countries in the world show that the people and governments of these countries believe that this report and the letter from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments of all countries once again prove the Soviet people's commitment to peace. The session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is another important contribution of the Soviet Union to the changes that have emerged in international relations towards peace and the relaxation of tensions, and to the cause of developing international peaceful and friendly relations.

	Comrades! The great vitality of the socialist revolution, as the historical experience of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries shows, lies in the fact that it can successfully solve the most difficult and urgent problems of mankind that have been accumulated for generations.

	For thousands of years, working people have been groaning under the oppression of the exploitation system. The October Revolution eliminated this injustice for the first time in history, and eradicated the social system based on the exploitation of man by man. New relations—relations of comradely cooperation and mutual assistance—have been established between people.

	The situation in the generations of society under the rule of exploiters is: the more powerful and developed nationalities exploit and plunder backward nationalities and tribes. The October Revolution ended this extremely unfair phenomenon in our country, and established truly equal and fraternal relations among all nationalities.

	For thousands of years, destructive and predatory wars have been a heavy disaster for mankind. In the imperialist era, war has become a fatal plague, namely the so-called Black Death in the Middle Ages. The October Revolution raised the banner of fighting against this most dangerous disaster among all disasters, and pointed out to mankind the bright path of peaceful friendship among all peoples, and the path of building communism. Under the communist social system, war will be forever and completely excluded from social life.

	The October Revolution established a new economic system, which opened up a source for developing human and material resources, so that our liberated people could build a world-recognized world power in one generation from an economically backward and subordinate country in the past.

	The greatness of the Great October Socialist Revolution lies here.

	Long live the forty-second anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution!

	Long live the glorious Communist Party that confidently leads the Soviet people to the victory of communism under the banner of the October Revolution!

	Glory to the great Soviet people—the builders of communism, the tireless fighters for world peace!

    关于伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年
    阿里斯托夫在莫斯科十月革命四十二周年庆祝大会上的报告
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科6日电：莫斯科各界人士6日在列宁中央运动场体育宫举行了伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年庆祝大会。苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员、中央委员会书记处书记阿里斯托夫在庆祝大会上作了关于伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年的报告。报告全文如下：
    同志们！四十二年以前，一件最伟大的事件震撼了全世界。在俄国，伟大的十月社会主义革命取得了胜利。世界帝国主义阵线被突破了。工人和农民们在以弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁为首的共产党的领导下，推翻了资本家和地主的统治，并建立了苏维埃政权。在世界历史上，劳动人民和被剥削的人民第一次获得了真正的人权和自由，成了自己命运的主人。
    十月革命把我国各族人民从社会压迫和民族压迫下解放出来。它打破了对生产力的束缚，开辟了永不枯竭的生命力的源泉，苏联人民从中汲取了无穷无尽的力量，越来越富强。社会主义革命为劳动人民自由地发挥自己的才能、智慧和天才开辟了无限的可能。它把国家的管理权交给劳动人民，并引导他们走上宏伟的社会主义改造的宽阔道路。
    今天，我们庆祝伟大的十月革命四十二周年。回顾一下这些年来我们走过的道路，我们可以自豪地说，我们英雄的人民已经把自己的国家变成了强大的社会主义国家，并取得了为整个进步人类所赞扬的成就。
    社会主义革命的伟大创造性力量
    同志们！四十二年来，苏联人民走过了艰巨的漫长道路。还在革命的最初岁月里，年青的苏维埃共和国就遭到了国内反革命和外国武装干涉者的庞大军队的进攻。敌人把内战强加给我们，使我们在好几年的时间内没有可能从事和平的创造性的劳动。
    苏维埃国家遭到了很大的牺牲。在争取祖国自由、争取劳动人民幸福的斗争中，很多著名的革命家，人民的成千上万的优秀儿女付出了自己的生命。武装干涉者和白卫军占据了国内极重要的地区。他们想扼杀我们。但是，苏联人民没有被吓倒，也没有投降，列宁的声音、布尔什维克的声音把我们的力量团结在一起，鼓舞我们为正义的事业、为伟大的革命事业而斗争。当时，在敌人的炮火下，人民建立了新制度，巩固了自己的苏维埃国家。
    我们的人民以自己英勇的劳动克服了巨大的困难，到1927年就完全恢复了被破坏的经济。然后用了十五年的时间来消除过去遗留下来的世世代代的经济落后状态，建立起强大的工业、大规模的机械化农业，并广泛地展开文化建设。由于党执行了列宁的英明的民族政策，在短短的时期内，世世代代遭受压迫的各族人民就达到了先进民族的水平。在我们这里建立了繁荣的加盟共和国与自治共和国。
    在第二次世界大战开始时，在重要的工业产品的生产方面，苏联已经赶上了高度发达的欧洲资本主义国家。而当法西斯德国背信弃义地进攻苏联时，我们的经济能够在战争的过程中保证以击溃敌人所必需的一切来供应苏联军队。
    这次战争给我们带来了极大的损失和破坏。它夺去了数百万人——我们的父兄和子女，我们社会主义祖国的光荣爱国者的生命。它给我国妇女也带来了很大牺牲和很多苦难。法西斯强盗在退却时进行了疯狂的破坏，烧毁了城市、乡村、工厂、集体农庄和国营农场。卫国战争年代是对我们的最严酷的考验。但是，紧密地团结在共产党周围的我国人民经受住了这次考验，击溃了敌人，保卫住了伟大十月革命的果实。
    苏联人民只用了五、六年的时间，就从废墟中重建了城市和乡村，医治好战争的创伤，并且以更加充沛的热情开始建设和发展工业、农业和文化，增进劳动人民的福利。共产党——列宁的党尽管经受了落在苏联人民身上的极其严重的种种考验，但它善于唤醒劳动人民和加强他们对自己力量的信心、对共产主义必胜的信心，使他们干出了真正的奇迹！
    同志们！列宁曾经指出，我们的革命就其实质来说是建设性的革命。他说：“在任何社会主义革命中，从而也包括1917年10月25日我们在俄国所开始的社会主义革命中，无产阶级及其所领导的最贫穷的农民的主要任务就是进行积极的、也就是建设性的工作”。
    社会主义的敌人曾经恶毒地诽谤十月革命，说它是盲目的自发势力，只能带来破坏。前英国驻俄国大使布坎南曾在他的回忆录中写道，布尔什维克“只是破坏的力量，而不是创造的力量。他们善于破坏，而丝毫不会恢复”。资产阶级的谎言家们在全世界各个角落散布这种荒唐的谰言，他们用恶毒的字眼诽谤布尔什维克，诽谤苏联人。在我们的时代里，这种人也没有绝迹，他们在继续干着这种可耻的勾当。按照旧时的民间迷信的传说，这些诽谤者死后到阴间是要下油锅的。我们认为，对现在的某些诽谤者来说，最好是在这一世就下油锅。
    当然，我国的劳动人民在通向伟大目标的道路上曾经不得不进行破坏工作。然而，这只是在消除腐朽的和阻碍社会向前发展的渣滓方面进行清扫工作。不对旧世界进行战斗，它是不愿意投降的。革命的敌人进行了殊死的反抗，因此，他们才被人民的力量摧毁。
    共产党、列宁认为，破坏旧的、过时的事物，是建立新的、进步的和公正的社会制度所必需的条件。这就是伟大的、人民的创造性革命——十月革命的最重要的特点。
    无论我们的敌人怎样千方百计地诽谤社会主义制度，然而生活却无可辩驳地证明，苏联人民正在通过和平的创造性的劳动、而不是通过战争和扩张的途径来实现自己的计划和愿望。用千百万劳动者的努力建立起来的社会主义制度，不需要用强制的手段去推行和确立。这种制度为自己开辟了道路，因为它符合人民的根本利益，符合社会历史发展的迫切需要。它把人的人格作为最有价值的东西提高起来，保证人民充分全面地发挥他们的天才，去从事和平的劳动。
    人的自由劳动在新的社会制度下到处唤起创造力量，创造越来越多的生活资料，给国家经济文化各部门带来繁荣。共产主义的思想对于全世界亿万群众的强大吸引力就在于此。
    同志们！党的第二十一次代表大会宣布，社会主义不仅完全胜利了，而且彻底胜利了，我们的祖国进入了新的发展阶段——全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期。代表大会的历史性决议和赫鲁晓夫同志的报告，确定了党和人民在我们发展的新阶段中的主要任务，制定了宏伟的共产主义建设纲领。现在苏联人集中一切智慧和力量来加速我们的前进，来提前完成发展国民经济的七年计划。应该十分满意地指出，今年我国劳动人民怀着特别愉快的心情迎接伟大的十月革命节。
    在刚刚闭幕的苏联最高苏维埃会议上初步总结了今年的经济建设，总结了我们在国际事务中的成就。
    在会上发言的各共和国的代表纷纷谈到了我国劳动人民为实现七年计划的头一年计划而奋斗的成果。他们说，各个共和国的事业都进行得很顺利，生活变得越来越愉快和幸福。代表们说，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的决议和中央六月全会关于技术进步的决议正在顺利地贯彻；新技术、全盘机械化和自动化——不断提高劳动生产率的最重要的基础——正在以越来越快的速度在国民经济中推行。
    苏联最高苏维埃会议通过了1960年发展国民经济的计划。这个计划规定工业产量的增长大大超过最初拟定的七年计划第二年的增长。生活提出了很好的修正。
    我们把苏联工业的新成就看作是改组工业和建筑业管理的丰硕成果。国民经济委员会的工作经验确凿地表明，在一切经济指标方面，我们的社会主义生产速度都极显著地加快了。这里表现了党中央委员会的远见，因为它制定和实施了改进工业和建筑业领导的根本措施。必须再一次指出，反党集团反对改组生产的管理，这说明反党集团脱离生活，目光多么短浅，如果它不及时地被揭露和粉碎，它会给我们的国民经济带来多大的危害。
    今年在发展农业方面也取得了新的成就。虽然我国有些地区发生了干旱，但是今年的谷物收获量仍然多于开垦荒地以前的最大丰收年。截至11月1日为止，全国的谷物采购总量比1949—1953年的平均采购量多八亿二千五百万普特。今年农作物的收获量完全可以保障国家的各种需要。
    1959年农业方面的特点是：公有畜牧业的发展速度更快了。巩固的饲料基地的建立，首先是玉蜀黍青饲料产量的增加，在发展畜牧业方面起了重要的作用。
    苏联各族人民友爱大家庭中的农村劳动者用巨大的成就迎接了十月革命四十二周年。在伟大节日的前夕，光荣的乌克兰共和国的农业工作者向党中央委员会和苏联政府报喜：他们提前完成了把谷物、肉类、乳类和其他产品交售给国家的计划，实现了超计划把粮食交售给国家的保证，这使我们大家感到高兴。塔吉克、乌兹别克、吉尔吉斯、土库曼和阿塞拜疆共和国集体农民的棉花获得了丰收。哈萨克的国营农场和集体农庄在新垦地上的谷物生产和发展畜牧业方面取得了很大的成就。今年格鲁吉亚、亚美尼亚、摩尔达维亚的果园、茶场和葡萄园的劳动者以及白俄罗斯、拉脱维亚、立陶宛和爱沙尼亚的畜牧饲养者和亚麻种植者的劳动成绩也很好。
    乌拉尔、巴什基尔、鞑靼、库班、西伯利亚许多州、伏尔加河流域以及俄罗斯联邦其他一些地区的劳动者，都顺利地完成了把谷物、畜产品、蔬菜和水果交售给国家的保证。大家都清楚地知道梁赞州畜牧饲养者的卓越创举。他们在向国家交售肉类方面已经完成了两年计划，并且保证到年底还要完成第三年的计划。一年完成三年计划，同时增加牲畜的总头数，这确实是值得大大赞扬的忘我劳动。
    这一切令人信服地说明了苏共中央1953年九月全会的决议以及党和政府发展农业的其他决议的重大意义，说明最近几年所实施的措施，特别是在开垦荒地和发展畜牧业方面的措施取得了丰硕成果。不能不指出，我国全体人民公认尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在这方面有特殊的功绩。
    每个苏联人在日常生活中都感到我国农业取得了巨大的成就。但是我们还要做许多工作来增产农产品，把落后的集体农庄和国营农场提高为先进的集体农庄和国营农场。现在，农村的各级党组织和劳动者都在积极地准备迎接苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议，这个会议将讨论进一步发展农业的问题。
    七年计划的第一年在提高苏联人民的物质福利方面取得了巨大成就。最近制定了并且正在实行增产消费品的措施。国家对劳动人民文化生活需要和社会赡养的拨款大大增加了。工人、农民和职员的收入正在逐年增加。
    特别是在最近几年，我们国家一些最重要的食品的消费都在迅速增长。同1952年相比，在国家和合作社的贸易中，肉类和肉制品的销售量增加了两倍多，乳类和乳制品增加了三倍多，动物油脂几乎增加了一倍半，砂糖几乎增加了一倍。同志们，这就是说，每个苏联人家庭的桌上都摆着越来越多的各种各样的食品。
    但是我们知道，应当生产更多的消费品，以便在最近几年内就使这些产品达到完全充裕的地步。党和政府非常重视这项任务。
    我们在住宅建筑方面取得了很大的成就。今年在城市和工人住宅区里将建成总面积为八千多万平方米的住宅。苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议通过了1960年建设一亿零一百万平方米住宅的计划，这将有可能保证使更多的劳动者得到住宅。
    在迎接十月革命四十二周年的时候，我国人民在发展文化方面也取得了许多新的成就。党和政府关于改革国民教育制度的决议正在顺利实现。各级学校和科学研究机关加强了同生活和生产的联系，这对提高培养专门人材的质量和进一步发展科学技术产生了良好的影响，为对成长中的一代进行共产主义教育创造了良好的条件。
    我国在国民教育和科学技术成就方面被公认为是世界上先进的。由于苏联科学家、工程师、设计人员和工人的创造思想和忘我的劳动，苏联在探索宇宙方面走在其他国家的前面，我们不能不为此感到自豪。发射第一批人造地球卫星和宇宙火箭、第一批“小月亮”的光荣属于我们。
    我们社会主义国家是为了全体人民的利益而发展科学。我们希望科学减轻人们的劳动，美化世界生活，有助于最充分地利用一切自然财富和资源来为社会造福。因此，苏联科学家在工作时都意识到自己的伟大职责，他们的劳动得到了很高的评价，他们备受我国人民的关怀和爱戴。
    同志们！苏联人民沿着通往共产主义的道路走得越远，亿万劳动人民就越积极和自觉地参加社会生产，社会主义民主就越得到发扬。大规模的社会主义竞赛的开展、共产主义劳动队的建立、纺织女工加干诺娃和其他许多生产革新者的杰出的爱国主义功绩，以及梁赞的农业劳动者在加速发展畜牧业方面的光荣创举，这些都说明劳动积极性的提高，说明工人阶级、集体农民和知识分子对共产主义事业的无限忠诚。
    在我们国家中，所有社会团体，特别是共产主义青年团和工会，在建设新社会方面的作用正在不断增长，广大的人民群众越来越积极地参加管理国家的工作。不管是苏维埃代表也好，不管是关心采用新技术、提高生产和注意节约的生产会议的参加者也好，还是为使社会主义公共生活秩序得到遵守而斗争的纠察队员也好，苏联人在这一切方面都起了国家真正主人翁的作用。
    在苏联，共产主义建设已经成了每个人日常实践。在这种情况下，关心提高共产主义觉悟水平和培养我们的人的崇高道德品质，应当成为一项最重要的任务。这就要求我们把生活同一切思想工作更密切地联系起来，提高文学、艺术和所有文化机关在培养劳动人民为共产主义而积极奋斗的精神方面的作用。
    苏联人知道，我们的国家取得了何等伟大的成就，并且公正地为这些成就感到自豪。但是，党还像过去一样教导我们要谦虚，不要满足于已经取得的成就，要大胆地揭发工作中的缺点和及时纠正这些缺点。党要求担任领导职务的工作人员和我们的所有干部，不管他们在哪一部门工作，都要经常充实自己的知识，提高理论水平，关心和注意劳动人民的需要，珍视他们的高度信任，不要辜负这种信任。我们应当不懈地加强党和人民的团结一致，这是我们一切胜利的保障。
    列宁的和平和各国人民友好的思想的胜利
    同志们！人类从来没有过别的事件能像十月革命那样对整个世界发展的进程发生过这样大的影响。十月革命第一次给世界各国人民争取自由、争取持久和平和社会主义的斗争开辟了一条可靠的道路。我们感到幸福的是，属于社会主义世界体系的各国劳动人民和我们一道，在沿着通往共产主义的道路前进。欧洲和亚洲的所有社会主义国家都在胜利地建设新生活。在十月革命四十二周年的日子里，苏联人民向社会主义各国的兄弟人民致热烈的祝贺和最美好的祝愿。
    苏联和其他社会主义国家以自己的榜样的力量一年比一年更加博得全世界劳动人民的好感。同志们，我们相信，这样的时期一定会到来的：那时候，各国人民都怀着愉快的心情欢呼同时代的人获得幸福，并且怀着感激的心情想起列宁的名字，想起布尔什维克——伟大十月社会主义革命的第一批创始人以及所有建设了新生活和以艰苦的斗争与孜孜不倦的劳动捍卫过共产主义建设的伟大事业的人。
    同志们！苏维埃国家是在和平和各国人民友好的思想的旗帜下诞生的。第一个工农政府就曾经认为自己的神圣职责是坚决地反对帝国主义战争，给各国人民以正义和持久的和平。1917年11月8日列宁在全俄苏维埃第二次代表大会上所作的关于和平的报告中说过：“和平问题是现时最紧急、最迫切的问题。”
    由于苏联和其他社会主义国家以及一切爱好和平力量的努力，国际局势最近有了显著的好转。劳动人民是在加强世界和平的前景更加良好的情况下迎接这个伟大的十月的节日的。
    苏联和所有社会主义国家的威力的增长和国际影响的提高，是最近发生的有利于和平的变化的主要原因。现在已经形成了一片新的和平景象。十月革命的思想使社会主义在拥有十亿以上居民的一系列欧洲和亚洲国家中取得了胜利并确立起来了。十月革命宣布的无产阶级国际主义、各国人民平等和友谊以及兄弟般的互相帮助的原则，是社会主义国家大家庭牢不可破的基础。社会主义世界体系拥有丰富的资源，它始终不渝地执行和平政策，因此它的存在对侵略和战争的势力造成了强有力的障碍。现在，在资本主义国家有越来越多的人看到，社会主义力量的增长就是和平力量的增长。
    由于亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的民族解放运动不断取得新的胜利，帝国主义的殖民主义体系的最后基础正在崩溃。帝国主义者千方百计地想阻挠走上民族独立和自由的国家的发展。但是，尽管帝国主义者在施展各种阴谋诡计，为本国自由和民族独立而斗争的各国人民一定会取得胜利。权利和正义都在他们这一边！
    我们党和政府在自己的外交政策中一贯遵循着同不同社会制度的各国和平共处的列宁主义原则。
    事实上，难道一个已经消灭了热衷于军备竞赛和侵占别国领土的、迫使别国屈从自己的剥削阶级的国家会主张战争吗？难道实现了劳动人民世世代代的理想——成了本国一切物质财富和精神财富的主人的人民需要战争吗？弗拉基米尔·伊里奇说过：“俄国的工人和农民最珍视和平幸福。”
    弗·伊·列宁深刻地论证了和平共处政策。他说，苏维埃国家必须同不同的国家一起生活，为了各国人民的利益必须和平相处，保持睦邻关系，不断扩大政治、经济和文化联系。列宁的和平共处政策在我们党的决议中，在赫鲁晓夫同志的报告和言论中得到了进一步的论证和发展。
    各国人民把苏联政府首脑的访问美国称为和平友谊的伟大使命。我们全体苏联人民以非常高兴的心情讨论了这次具有历史意义的访问的结果。赫鲁晓夫同志访美是一个极重大的国际事件，这个事件吸引了全世界公众的注意。这是可以理解的，因为这次访问关系着和平，关系着全人类的命运。我国人民通过苏联政府首脑真诚地向美国人民伸出了友谊之手。这得到了绝大多数美国人民的好评，显然，他们已经厌恶“冷战”，并且开始认识到“冷战”可能造成怎样的致命后果。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在联合国大会第十四届会议上代表苏联政府提出的全面彻底裁军的建议，是一个高度人道主义的具体的和平纲领，这个纲领已经深入各国人民的心中。大家知道，苏联的建议是在严格的国际监督下实现裁军的整个纲领。
    裁军问题是人类当前主要的、最迫切的问题。正因为如此，苏联在联合国提出的全面彻底裁军纲领受到爱好和平的人民的热烈欢迎，并给人类带来了巨大的希望。亿万人民从这个明确的纲领中看到一条保障持久和平的现实途径。我们坚信，健康的思想迟早会获得胜利，人类终必会走上全面彻底裁军的道路。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫的具有历史意义的访美，给我们提供了一个榜样、一个生动的范例，它指明共产党员、苏联人民应该如何在行动上实现不同社会制度的国家和平共处的原则。
    尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇在美国人面前发表的演说中表现了他是多么热爱祖国，多么为祖国、为本国人民而自豪，多么尊严！苏联人对此表示敬佩和感谢。他的热情呼吁和平的演说引起了千千万万普通美国人的巨大兴趣。他坚定不移地捍卫了共产主义信仰，就连敌视和反对社会主义的人也不得不怀着尊敬的心情倾听他的演说。苏联政府首脑在美国的演说中表达了亿万苏联人的思想和愿望，体现了他们的伟大精神和坚定的意志，表达了他们对和平和各国人民友好的真正愿望。
    由于这次访问，我们在美国有了许多新朋友，他们第一次从苏联政府首脑的口中听到了我国的真相。由于这次访问，大大巩固了爱好和平人民的阵地，一批新的强大力量加入了争取巩固和平的大军的队伍。
    各国人民关于新战争可以避免的希望加强了，这种希望不是那么容易加以消灭的。新的时代到来了。每一个正直的人都珍视崇高的和平思想，这种思想终究是要胜利的！
    正因为如此，全体苏联人民、其他国家的劳动人民和进步人士才用这样多发自内心的热情和诚意的话语来表示感谢苏联政府，感谢争取国际和平的不倦战士——尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫。
    争取持久和平的斗争今后仍然是一个长期的斗争。为了消除“冷战”的一切后果，还得付出不少的精力和时间。为了阻挠国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，西方反动势力最近正在大肆活动。不过，我们希望，世界各国人民不要上声名狼籍的“冷战”鼓吹者的当。和平人民不要放松对反动派的阴谋的警惕，而要准备及时抓住那些胆敢煽起新战火的狂人之手。因此，只要战争的危险还存在，共产党和政府就认为它今后的职责仍然是关心改善捍卫我国人民和平劳动的苏联武装部队。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议上所作的“关于国际形势和苏联外交政策”的报告是当前极重要的政治文件，它在苏联人民保卫和平事业的斗争史中将占有显著地位。
    这个报告对国际局势作了深刻的分析，表明了苏联威望的提高，令人信服地阐明了始终不渝地执行和平政策、创造性地运用和发展列宁关于不同社会制度的国家和平共处的思想所取得的成果。进一步研究和平共处问题和当前实现和平共处的各种形式，有利于维护和巩固和平。
    我们的党和政府认为自己的职责是坚持这样的一个方针：从已经取得的国际局势的缓和走到完全消除紧张局势、走到世界和平的巩固。这个方针，在赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中得到了论证，并且得到苏联最高苏维埃会议的一致赞同，也受到全体苏联人民和所有爱好和平人民的支持和拥护。世界上大多数国家的许许多多的反应说明，这些国家的人民和政府认为，这个报告和苏联最高苏维埃告世界各国议会书再一次证明苏联人民致力于和平。苏联最高苏维埃会议是苏联对国际关系中已经出现的转向和平、转向紧张局势缓和的这种变化，以及对发展国际和平友好关系的事业的又一个重要的贡献。
    同志们！社会主义革命的伟大生命力，正如苏联和人民民主国家发展的历史经验所表明的，在于：它可以顺利地解决人类最困难的、世世代代积累下来的迫切问题。
    千百年来，劳动人民都是在剥削制度的压迫下呻吟。十月革命在历史上第一次消除了这种不公平的现象，铲除了建立在人剥削人的基础上的社会制度。人与人之间建立起来了新的关系——同志般的合作和互相帮助的关系。
    在剥削者统治下的世世代代社会的情况是：较强大的和发达的民族剥削和掠夺落后的民族和部族。十月革命在我们国家结束了这种极其不公平的现象，建立起来了各族人民真正平等与兄弟友好的关系。
    千百年来，破坏性的掠夺战争是人类的一个沉重灾难。在帝国主义时代，战争成了致命的瘟疫，即中世纪的所谓黑死病。十月革命举起了同一切祸害中这个最危险的灾祸作斗争的旗帜，给人类指出了各国人民和平友好的光明道路，建设共产主义的道路。在共产主义社会制度下，战争将从社会生活中永远地彻底地排除出去。
    十月革命建立了一种新的经济制度，这种制度打开了发展人力和物力的源泉，从而使我们解放了的人民能够在一代之中就把过去的一个经济落后的、处于从属地位的国家建成一个举世公认的世界强国。
    十月社会主义革命的伟大就在这里。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年万岁！
    满怀信心地领导苏联人民在十月革命的旗帜下走向共产主义胜利的光荣的共产党万岁！
    光荣归于伟大的苏联人民——共产主义建设者、为世界和平而不倦奋斗的战士！
