    Guo Yunsheng, the director of the Wenjiadian Tax Office in Sinan County, Guizhou Province, and a member of the Communist Party, is a talent for cultivating sources of wealth.

    The Qunhe People's Commune in HePeng Township, Wenjiadian, is located on the bank of the Wujiang River and is rich in resources, with many avenues for sideline production. Based on this situation, Guo Yunsheng discussed with the commune director ways to develop sideline production and increase income, suggesting that the commune first build an oil press, and helped with material selection, purchasing oil rings and oil hammers, and raising funds. More than a month later, the Qunhe Commune's oil press was built. Then, he helped the commune organize more than 40 people to carry out sideline production such as dyeing cloth, cotton ginning, rice milling, sulfur mining, and saltpeter boiling, according to the resource and labor arrangements, increasing the commune's income by more than 4,600 yuan, which satisfied the Party committee, pleased the commune members, and increased tax revenue.

    In order to save grain and brew wine with substitutes, Guo Yunsheng searched everywhere for raw materials that could replace grain for winemaking and assisted the masses in conducting experiments. He successfully experimented with more than 20 kinds of raw materials, including galangal, chaff, corn stalks, and pumpkins. Now these substitute raw materials are widely used throughout the area, which not only increases the supply of wine on the market, but also saves grain for the country and increases tax revenue.

    When he learned that the Wenjiadian Paper Mill was affected by production due to the lack of raw material bamboo pulp, he actively studied using cogongrass to make paper. After two days and two nights of experimentation, he finally succeeded, and the effect was very good. In addition, he also worked with oil pressing workers to experiment with using wild plants such as dog pepper seeds, tung seeds, and fragrant tea seeds to extract oil, which was also successful, opening up new avenues for increasing oil production.

    郭云声——培养财源的能手
    贵州省思南县文家店税务所所长、共产党员郭云声，是一个培养财源的能手。
    文家店合朋乡群合人民公社位于乌江河岸，境内资源丰富，副业门路很多。郭云声根据这种情况，就找社主任研究发展副业生产、增加收入的门路，建议公社先建油榨，并帮助选料，购买油圈、油锤、筹集资金等。一个多月以后，群合公社的油榨修建起来了。接着，他又帮助公社根据资源和劳动力的安排情况，组织了四十多人开展染布、弹花、碾米、挖硫磺、熬火硝等副业生产，为公社增加收入四千六百多元，做到了党委满意、社员欢喜、税收增加。
    为了节约粮食、用代用品酿酒，郭云声四处寻找可以代替粮食酿酒的原料，并协助群众进行试验。经他试验成功的就有老虎姜、糠壳、包谷秆、南瓜等二十多种原料。现在全区普遍采用了这些代用原料，既增加了市场上酒类的供应，又为国家节约了粮食，增加了税收。
    他了解到文家店纸厂由于缺乏原料竹麻而影响生产的时候，就积极地钻研用茅草造纸。经过两天两夜的试验，终于成功了，而且效果很好。此外，他还同榨油工人一道试验利用狗椒子、桐麻子、香茶子等野生植物榨油，也获得成功，给油脂增产开辟了新的途径。
