Zhang Fulai is a worker at the Hefei Agricultural Machinery Factory in Anhui Province. Since he started working in 1950, under the leadership and cultivation of the Party, and with the help of his comrades, he has successively invented and created 21 advanced tools and equipment, such as the grain purity calculator. He has been awarded the honorary titles of advanced producer, model worker, and socialist construction activist at the national, provincial, municipal, county, district, and enterprise levels a total of 19 times.

In 1950, he served as a grain custodian at the Rao Hai warehouse in Fuyang County. At that time, tens of thousands of kilograms of grain had to be weighed at the warehouse every day. From winnowing, sifting, weighing to counting, everything was done manually, which was both laborious and inefficient. Zhang Fulai thought to himself: Could a machine be created to replace this series of heavy manual labor? From then on, "machines" became like magnets, attracting his attention. Initially, he only thought about improving the weighing scale, but after many experiments, he did not succeed. Later, he used the principle of the old-fashioned rice winnowing machine's fan blades and the flour mill's foot-operated sifter to make two models for winnowing and sifting. He also made a cloth belt based on the principle of the cotton gin's bamboo curtain conveying cotton, as a conveyor belt from winnowing to sifting. In this way, he smoothly solved the automation problem from winnowing to sifting. However, "the rat pulls a wooden plough—the big end is at the back": automating weighing and counting was much more complicated and difficult than the winnowing and sifting part. At this time, he deeply felt that: it is not enough to have enthusiasm without technology. He went to the Xinhua Bookstore and bought many related technical books, but he could not find such a thing. Finally, in a "Soviet Agricultural Machinery Handbook", he saw a potato planter with a disc seeder on it. The disc had six slots, and each rotation dropped a seedling. This gave him great inspiration. He thought, if the slots were changed to hoppers, wouldn't it be possible to send the grain down hopper by hopper? He designed and trial-produced according to this principle. But what material should be used to make the model? Using wood would be bulky and not strong; using steel would be good, but it would be too hard, impossible to melt, and there would be no tools to process it. One day, he saw several old records on a secondhand stall on the street, softened by the sun. He was overjoyed, thinking he had found a "good material" for casting models. So he bought several records and took them home to boil in a pot. After a while, he saw the fire burning red under the pot, and estimated that it had melted. Who knew that when he opened the pot, the records "bang" ignited... This experiment was declared a failure. After this incident spread, someone ridiculed him, saying: "Zhang Fulai, how can you, a roughneck, make any machines? It's like a toad wanting to eat swan meat!" But this did not discourage Zhang Fulai, because the Party supported him.

In order to help him learn technology, the leadership transferred him to the Fuyang Prefectural Grain Bureau's technical training class to learn how to repair weighing scales. Through this study, he mastered a lot of knowledge and repair technology related to weighing scales. After returning, he continued to study hard. One day, warehouse keeper Comrade Wang Jie brought a counting machine from the prefecture, and said as soon as he entered the door: "Old Zhang, I brought you a gift. This broken counting machine is here for you to repair, and you can also learn from it and develop your automatic weighing scale." He happily accepted it and spent several nights carefully studying the parts of the counting machine one by one, and repaired the broken counting machine. Based on the principle of the counting machine, he designed a grain purity calculator that automated the entire process of winnowing, sifting, weighing, and counting. In order to avoid waste, he wanted to have a technician appraise the design drawings before trial production. But who should he look for? He suddenly remembered that Comrade Zeng Xisheng, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, had always attached great importance to the technical innovations and inventions of the masses, so he wrote a letter to Comrade Zeng Xisheng with excitement. Comrade Zeng Xisheng quickly replied to him, telling him to hurry to Hefei.

The day after arriving in Hefei, Comrade Zeng Xisheng received him, opened the drawings and carefully observed them. He praised the machine's good design, saying that if the trial production was successful, it would have great value for promotion. He encouraged him to learn with an open mind, not to be afraid of difficulties, and to successfully trial-produce the machine. Finally, he introduced him to the Hefei Farm Implement Factory and asked the technicians to assist him in the trial production. The Party's support gave him tremendous encouragement and strength, and he was even more confident.

At the Hefei Farm Implement Factory, the factory leaders assigned two highly skilled carpenters to help him. With the enthusiastic help of the experienced workers, they quickly made a small model of a grain purity calculator that automated winnowing, sifting, weighing, and counting. He immediately sent it to Comrade Zeng Xisheng to see. Comrade Zeng Xisheng personally tested it with sand and said with a smile: "Very good. How efficient is this machine?" He replied that it could process 80,000 kilograms of grain a day. Comrade Zeng Xisheng then asked: "Can it be made bigger so that it can process 500,000 kilograms or 1 million kilograms of grain a day?" He excitedly said: "Yes, definitely! With the support of the Party and the help of the comrades, any difficulty can be overcome!" So, he and the experienced workers together adopted a gradual expansion approach and made a grain purity calculator that could process 500,000 kilograms of grain a day. But a problem occurred during testing: after the grain entered the measuring hopper, the disc kept spinning and could not be controlled. What was the reason? He couldn't figure it out. Later, a technician told him: "This is inertia. Inertia can be used, but it cannot be controlled." He said no, inertia must be controlled in this type of machine. How to control inertia? He studied it for several days without getting a clue.

One night, he tossed and turned and couldn't sleep. Everything around him was quiet, only the alarm clock on the bedside table was ticking. He suddenly thought: why does the pendulum of the alarm clock swing back and forth instead of spinning continuously? He immediately took apart the alarm clock and found that the pendulum of the alarm clock was held in place by something, so it could swing rhythmically. Oh! He suddenly realized: "Wouldn't it work to install a control card on the disc of the grain purity calculator?" So he picked up a pen and drew a diagram. The next morning, he rushed to the factory and said to everyone: "It's done! It's done! There is a way to control inertia!" After seven trial productions, the inertia control card was finally made. From then on, the last hurdle of the grain purity calculator was overcome, and a new machine that fully automated winnowing, sifting, weighing, and counting was officially born. It could replace the efficiency of four hundred laborers. When this machine was exhibited at the National Agricultural Exhibition in 1958, it was praised by Soviet experts and scientists in the capital.

In addition to the grain purity calculator, he also created, invented and improved wooden three-wheeled waterwheels, high-pressure blowers, wooden bicycles, Liberation-style waterwheels, as well as homemade electric lights, homemade telephones, and other things. In June 1958, he was honorably admitted as a member of the Chinese Agricultural Machinery and Chemical Society and was hired as a special researcher at the Institute of Mechanization of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

    “土”专家张福来
    张福来是安徽省合肥农业机械厂的工人。他从1950年参加工作以来，在党的领导和培养下，在同志们的帮助下，先后发明创造了净粮计算器等二十一种先进工具和设备，曾先后十九次获得全国、省、市、县、区和企业的先进生产者、劳动模范和社会主义建设积极分子等光荣称号。
    1950年，他在阜阳县饶海仓库担任粮食保管员。那时，仓库里每天要有几万斤粮食过磅，从风扬、过筛、过磅直到计数都是人工操作，既费力，效率又低。张福来心里就想：能不能创造一种机器来代替这一系列的繁重体力劳动呢？从此，“机器”这玩艺就像磁铁石一样吸住了他的心。开始，他只在磅秤上想法改进，经过多次试验也没有成功。后来，他就利用老式风米车的风叶板和磨坊里的脚踏箩柜筛的原理，做了风扬和过筛两个模型；又根据弹花机用竹帘传送棉花的原理，做了一条布带，作为从风扬到过筛的传送带。就这样，顺利地解决了从风扬到过筛的自动化问题。可是，“老鼠拉木锨——大头在后边”：要过磅、计数自动化，可比风扬、过筛部分要复杂得多，困难得多。这时，他深深感到：光有干劲，没有技术是不行的。他到新华书店买了许多有关的技术书籍，也没有找到这种东西。最后在一本“苏联农业机械手册”上，看到一种马铃薯播种机，上面有一个圆盘播种器，圆盘上有六个槽，一转就掉下一块种苗。这给他很大启发。他想，如果把槽子改成斗，那不就可以把粮食一斗一斗地送下来了吗？他就按照这个原理进行设计和试制。可是用什么材料来做模型呢？用木头做既笨重又不坚固；用钢铁做固然好，但又太硬，无法熔化，也没有工具加工。一天，他在大街上看到旧货摊上有几张旧唱片，被太阳晒得发软。他一见就满心高兴，以为可找到铸造模型的“好材料”了。于是买了几张唱片回家，放到锅里熬了起来。过了一会，他看锅底下火烧得红通通的，估计已经熔化了，谁知揭开锅一看，唱片“轰”地一声着了起来……这个试验宣告失败了。这事情传出去以后，有人就讽刺他说：“张福来，你大老粗能造什么机器，简直是蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉！”但这并没有使张福来灰心，因为有党在支持他。
    为了使他学会技术，领导上把他调到阜阳专署粮食局技术训练班学习修理磅秤。通过这次学习，他掌握了不少有关磅秤方面的知识和修理技术。回来以后，他继续钻研。一天，仓库保管员王杰同志从专署带来了一部计数机，一进门就说：“老张，我给你带来一个礼物，这部坏了的计数机一来请你修理，二来你可以从中吸取经验，搞你那个自动磅秤。”他高兴地把它接过来，花了几个夜晚的时间，把计数机的零件一件一件地拆开来仔细研究，修好了这部坏计数机。他根据计数机的原理设计了风、筛、磅、计数过程全部自动化的净粮计算器。为了避免浪费，他想把设计图纸请个技术人员鉴定以后再试制。可是去找谁呢？他忽然想起省委第一书记曾希圣同志一向很重视群众的技术革新和创造发明，于是怀着激动的心情给曾希圣同志写了一封信。曾希圣同志很快就给他回了信，叫他赶快到合肥去。
    到合肥的第二天，曾希圣同志就接见了他，打开了图纸仔细观察后，称赞这个机器设计得好，说试制成功了有很大推广价值，勉励他虚心学习，不要怕困难，要把机器试制成功，最后又介绍他到合肥农具厂，请技术人员协助他试制。党的支持给了他巨大的鼓舞和力量，信心更足了。
    到了合肥农具厂，厂领导同志抽出两个技术较高的木工帮助他。在老师傅的热情帮助下，很快就制成了一个风、筛、磅、计数全部自动化的净粮计算器小模型。他立即把它送给曾希圣同志看。曾希圣同志亲自用沙子作了试验，笑着对他说：“很好。这部机器效能有多大？”他回答说，一天能处理八万斤粮食。曾希圣同志又问：“能不能再搞大些，让它一天处理五十万斤或一百万斤粮食？”他激动地说：“能，一定能，有党的支持和同志们的帮助，什么困难都可以战胜！”于是，他和老师傅一起，采取逐步扩大的办法，又做成一个每天能处理五十万斤粮食的净粮计算器。可是一试验却出了问题：粮食进入衡量斗以后，圆盘旋转不停，再也控制不住。究竟是什么道理呢？他百思而不得其解。后来一位技术员对他说：“这是惯性作用，惯性可以利用，但不可以控制。”他说不行，在这种机器里必须设法控制惯性。究竟怎样才能控制惯性呢？一连研究好几天，没有搞出个头绪来。
    一天夜里，他翻来复去睡不着，周围一切都是静悄悄地，只有床头上的闹钟在滴滴答答地响着。他忽然想起：闹钟的摆为什么能来回摆动、而不是一个劲的转呢？”他马上把闹钟拆开来看，发现闹钟的摆是由一个东西把它卡住的，所以它才能够有节奏地摆动。哦！这下子他恍然大悟了：“如果在净粮计算器的圆盘上安装一个控制卡不就行了吗？”于是他拿起笔画了个图样，第二天一早就飞也似的跑到厂里对大伙说：“行啦，行啦，惯性有办法治啦！”经过七次试制，终于把惯性控制卡制成了。从此，净粮计算器最后一道难关被突破了，一部从风扬、过筛、过磅和计数全是自动化的新机器正式诞生了，它可以抵上四百个劳动力的功效。这部机器在1958年全国农业展览会上展出时，受到了苏联专家和首都科学界人士的赞扬。
    除了净粮计算器外，他还创造发明和改进了木质三轮车式水车、高压鼓风机、木质自行车、解放式水车以及土电灯、土电话等东西。1958年6月，他光荣地被吸收为中国农业机械化学会会员，并被聘请为中国农业科学院机械化研究所特约研究员。
