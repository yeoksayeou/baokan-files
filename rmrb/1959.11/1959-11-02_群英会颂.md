　　Little Five is the youngest, and before I even got home, he was already done with school, waiting for me outside the door.
　　Little Three and Little Four arrived home at the same time as me.
　　“Where have you been? You look so happy!” The children, seeing my beaming face, asked.
　　“How could I not be happy? I just attended the opening ceremony of the Gathering of Heroes!” I proudly replied. We went into the house together.
　　“Gathering of Heroes? Gathering of Heroes!” The children’s tone and expression clearly showed that they shared my pride. Then: “We all want to be heroes too!”
　　“Right! Right! All of our people across the country have a most important lesson, which is to learn from the heroes!”
　　Little Three, with his richer knowledge, said: “Learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, catch up with the advanced! Right?”
　　“Right! Heroes are good examples. All of us, men and women, old and young, must aspire to catch up, and strive together for the Great Leap Forward!”
　　“You have to be like that too, right? Dad!” Little Five asked.
　　Little Four answered for me: “There are no exceptions! The older you get, the easier it is to fall behind, so you have to be especially energetic!”
　　Little Three defended me: “Dad uses a pen, he doesn’t do technical innovations or anything!”
　　“Well, Little Three, I want to innovate my thinking, and use my pen with greater speed, efficiency, and economy! I want to use my words to inspire everyone’s enthusiasm, is that okay?” I looked at Little Four.
　　Before Little Four could think of an answer, Little Five, who loves listening to stories, suggested: “Tell us some things about the conference. First, tell us which hero you saw?”
　　“Everyone I saw was a hero, more than six thousand! Ah—right, as soon as I entered the Great Hall, I met the old hero Meng Tai!”
　　The children all said: “We’ve all seen him, he’s so lovable!”
　　“Where did you see him?” I was a little surprised.
　　“In the movies! He…”
　　I quickly continued, to avoid them arguing about the movie: “Well, I even shook hands with the old hero!”
　　“Shook hands?” The children gasped with envy!
　　“Why didn’t you invite him home?” Little Three was a little dissatisfied with me.
　　I asked back: “Little Three, if I invited the old hero over, how would you entertain him?”
　　Little Three said confidently: “I’d give him my red scarf!”
　　Seeing Little Three’s victory, Little Four quickly asked: “Which other hero did you see?” I knew he wanted to offer his red scarf too.
　　“I also saw the female hero from the postal and telecommunications department, Qin Benxiu. Didn’t she come to our house the day before yesterday?”
　　Six eyes widened at once: “We didn’t see her!”
　　“Weren’t you all at school?”
　　Little Five quickly asked: “Is she pretty?”
　　“She’s the most beautiful!”
　　“How is she beautiful?”
　　“Her heart is beautiful! All six thousand heroes, their hearts are the most beautiful! You see, she saw an old grandmother who was blind, feeling her way along the doors of the shops, and she quickly ran out to ask the old grandmother which shop she was looking for. It turned out that the old grandmother wanted to mail a letter. Comrade Qin helped the old grandmother inside, put an eight-fen stamp on the letter, and handed the two fen change back to the old grandmother. The old grandmother was so moved that she called her a relative! And another time, she saw a young man using the telephone, shivering with cold, and she quickly took off her own vest and asked him to put it on, afraid that he would catch a cold and get sick! You see, isn’t her heart beautiful?”
　　“Beautiful! So beautiful!” The children all nodded.
　　But, after a while, Little Four raised a question: “Dad, to be a hero, you don’t have to invent a space rocket, or charge in and out seven times at the Battle of Changban Slope, right? Helping a blind old grandmother is okay too?”
　　“Little Four, inventing rockets is heroic, fighting at the Battle of Changban Slope is heroic, but giving haircuts to everyone, delivering letters, cooking dishes, as long as you care about others, don’t fear hardship, and have a communist spirit, you’re all heroes too!”
　　“Oh!” Little Four was stunned for a moment. “Dad, I’m going to learn to be a barber tomorrow!”
　　Little Five remembered: “Dad, when I grow up, I’m going to drive a car!”
　　“That’s not enough! You have to be a barber hero, a driver hero!”
　　“How do we start?” Little Three asked me to be more specific.
　　“How about this?” I suggested: “Starting today, after school, we’ll read a passage or two of hero stories, and see how they became heroes. After studying diligently, we’ll ask ourselves every day to do something that makes others comfortable, benefits others, benefits the Great Leap Forward, and shows our love for our country, our party, and our people! What do you think?”
　　“Agreed! Agreed!” The children all raised their hands. Little Three was especially active, he suggested: “Let’s start right away! After dinner, Dad will read everyone hero stories, and then I’ll help Mom wash the dishes. I’ll help the people at home, and I’ll help the people outside too. Little Four, what about you?”
　　“I—” Little Four thought for a moment: “Answering the phone, feeding the chickens, that’s my job!”
　　Little Five said without waiting to be asked: “I’ll sweep the yard and take care of the sanitation!”
　　The Gathering of Heroes has educated our whole family, big and small. I am certain that it will surely inspire hundreds of millions of men and women across the country, more and more heroes will emerge, and the wheels of our motherland’s history will advance with lightning speed!

    群英会颂
    老舍
    小五儿最小，我还没到家，他已下了学，在门外等着我。
    小三儿跟小四儿和我同时到了家。
    “上哪儿去了？这么喜欢！”孩子们见我眉开眼笑的，这么问。
    “我怎能不喜欢呢？刚刚参加了群英大会的开幕典礼啊！”我骄傲地回答。我们一同走进屋中。
    “群英会？群英会！”孩子们的口气与神色分明表示出分享着我的骄傲。然后：“我们也都要作英雄！”
    “对！对！咱们全国人民都有最重要的一课，就是向英雄们学习！”
    小三儿的知识较比丰富：“学先进，比先进，赶先进！对吧？”
    “对？英雄就是好榜样。咱们男男女女，老老少少全得立志赶上前去，一齐争取跃进，大跃进！”
    “你也得那样吧？爸！”小五儿问。
    小四儿替我回答：“没有例外！岁数越大越容易落后，得特别鼓干劲！”
    小三儿给我辩护：“爸是拿笔杆的，不会搞技术革新什么的！”
    “我呀，小三儿，我要革新思想，把笔杆耍得多快好省！我要用我的文字鼓起大家的干劲，行不行啊？”我看着小四儿。
    小四儿还没想起怎么答复，爱听故事的小五儿建议：“告诉我们点大会上的事情吧。先说你看见了哪位英雄？”
    “我看见的都是英雄，六千多位！啊——对，一进大礼堂门我就遇见了孟泰老英雄！”
    孩子们一齐说：“我们都看见过他，顶可爱啦！”
    “你们在哪儿见过他？”我有点惊异。
    “在电影片子里呀！他……”
    我赶紧往下说，省得他们争着讨论电影：“我呀，还跟老英雄握了手呢！”
    “握了手？”孩子们羡慕得直吸气！
    “你怎么不把他请到家里来呢？”小三儿有点不满意我。
    我反问：“小三儿，把老英雄请来，你怎么招待他呢？”
    小三儿胸有成竹：“把我的红领巾献给他！”
    小四儿见小三儿得胜，赶紧问：“还看见了哪位英雄？”我知道，他也要献出红领巾。
    “我还看见邮电部门女英雄覃本秀。前天，她不是上咱们家里来了吗？”
    六只眼一齐睁大：“我们没看见她呀！”
    “你们不是都上学了吗？”
    小五儿忙问：“她美不美？”
    “她最美！”
    “怎么美？”
    “她心里美！六千多位英雄啊，心里都最美！你们看，她呀，看见一位双目失明的老奶奶，用手摸索铺户的门，她就赶快跑出去，问老奶奶找什么铺子，原来老奶奶呀正是要寄一封信。覃同志就把老奶奶搀进去，给信上贴好八分票，把找回的二分钱递在老奶奶的手中。老奶奶感动得叫她亲人！还有一次呀，他看见一位用电话的青年，冷得发噤，她就赶快脱下自己的背心，请他穿上，恐怕他受了寒，生病！你们看，她的心美不美？”
    “美！真美！”孩子们一齐点头。
    可是，过了一会儿，小四儿提出问题：“爸，作英雄不必发明宇宙火箭，或是七出七入大战长坂坡啊？搀搀瞎老奶奶也行啊？”
    “小四儿，发明火箭的是英雄，大战长坂坡的是英雄，可是给大家理发的，收信的，炒菜的，只要关心别人，不辞劳苦，有共产主义作风的，也都是英雄！”
    “呕！”小四儿愕了一会儿，“爸，赶明儿我去学理发！”
    小五儿想起来：“爸，我长大了去开汽车！”
    “那还不够！得作理发英雄，司机英雄！”
    “怎么开始呢？”小三儿要求我说得具体一些。
    “这么办好不好？”我建议：由今天起，你们下了学，咱们就念一段或者两段英雄故事，看看他们怎么作的英雄。认真地学习之后，咱们就每天要求自己作点叫别人舒服，对别人有益，对大跃进有利，表现我们爱国爱党爱人民的事！你们看怎样？”
    “赞成！赞成！”孩子们都举起双手。小三儿特别积极，他提议：“马上就作起来！吃完饭，爸给大家念英雄故事，然后我帮助妈妈刷家伙洗碗。我帮助家里的人，也帮助外面的人。小四儿你呢？”
    “我——”小四儿想了想：“接电话，喂小鸡，归我！
    小五儿没等问就说：“我扫院子，管卫生！”
    群英大会教育了我们一家大小。我确信，它必定能够鼓动全国亿万男女，英雄越来越多，叫祖国的历史车轮飞也似的前进！
