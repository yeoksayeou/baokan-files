    A Monument to the Progress of Historical Science
    Introducing Volume One of "World History"
    Edited by the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Translated by Beijing Compilation Bureau, Published by Sanlian Bookstore Zhou Yitian Zhu Longhua Qi Sihe Li Kaiwu

    The ten-volume "World History," edited by the Soviet Academy of Sciences, is the first large-scale, comprehensive world history in the world that elucidates the development process of human society under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. In order to complete this major scientific task, the Soviet Academy of Sciences mobilized well-known experts from various historical departments across the country and formed an editorial board headed by Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Zhukov, to carry out the writing work. The first volume was published in 1955, and the fifth volume has now been published.

    This world history, which comprehensively narrates the historical development of mankind, summarizes all the research achievements of previous historians and advances the level of this discipline to an unprecedented height. The publication of this work is a major event in the world's historical circles. Now the Chinese translation of the first volume has been published, and the remaining volumes will be published successively. It is also a major event in China's historical circles that this world history, which is about millions of words long, is translated into Chinese.

    Some bourgeois historians have also compiled multi-volume world histories before. However, the authors of these books, standing on the bourgeois position and using idealist methods, regarded human history as a continuation of a series of random events without any regularity, in which only special figures of the ruling class played a leading role, while the working people had no status. They regarded the existence of capitalism as eternal in order to defend the rule of the bourgeoisie. In terms of scope, these books are mainly a collection of histories of Western countries, and even Eastern European countries are placed in a subordinate position, not to mention countries outside Europe.

    This ten-volume World History, the original book, is printed in a sixteen-open large format, each volume being eight or nine hundred pages long. Volumes 1 and 2 describe the primitive commune and the ancient world (from the beginning to the fourth and fifth centuries AD), Volumes 3 and 4 describe medieval history (from the fifth century AD to the middle of the seventeenth century), Volumes 5, 6 and 7 describe modern history (from the British bourgeois revolution in the seventeenth century to the great October Socialist Revolution), and the last three volumes describe contemporary history (until the end of the Second World War). The scope of narration is very comprehensive. The histories of Asian and African countries, as well as the histories of the indigenous peoples of the Americas and Australia, have been restored to their due status. In addition to the text, each volume is accompanied by colored historical maps and exquisite illustrations specially designed for the book. At the end of the book, there are chronological tables of major events, bibliographies and indexes. The completeness of the compilation and the exquisiteness of the printing are unprecedented.

    This World History uses the viewpoint of Marxist-Leninist historical materialism to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the historical development of mankind worldwide. The preface to each volume of the book is an explanation of the development law of each historical stage. These explanations summarize the latest research results of Soviet historiography and are one of the most brilliant parts of each volume.

    The following is a brief introduction to the first volume, which has been translated into Chinese.

    There are two prefaces before the text of the first volume. One is "Words from the General Editorial Department," which is the general preface to the entire book. In this preface, which is as long as twenty-five pages, the authors give a concise overview of the basic laws and main stages of human social development. The article points out that the primitive commune system is the longest stage experienced by all mankind, slavery first appeared in Egypt, Mesopotamia and India, while feudalism first originated in China. The bourgeois revolution first achieved victory in Western Europe and North America, and the starting point of modern history is the victory of the great October Revolution in the Soviet Union. This is the main thread of world history. However, there can be various types of development on the same economic basis, each stage has remnants of previous social forms and the germination of new economic relations, and the social development of various nations is extremely unbalanced in each era, and not all nations experience all stages of social development. In this general preface, the authors give us a clear understanding of the torrent of human history. In addition to the general preface to the whole book, there is also a "Preface to Volume 1". In this preface, the authors elaborated on the theoretical problems of the historical development of hundreds of thousands of years described in this volume, including the main stages of the development of primitive society in different regions of the earth, the emergence of exploitation and the emergence of antagonistic societies. The text of this volume is divided into four parts and twenty-nine chapters. The whole book is narrated from the very beginning to the sixth century BC. The structure of the first volume is roughly like this.

    Due to the continuous discovery of underground materials and the rapid progress of theoretical research, there has been a huge development in the research of ancient world history in the past two or three decades. For example, due to the discovery of the Mari inscriptions, ancient Eastern historians postponed the date of the famous Code of Hammurabi by 150 years. Because paleographers discovered how to read the ancient Cretan script, historians clarified the social nature of ancient Crete. In recent years, Soviet scholars' discussions on the nature of ancient Oriental societies, and Chinese historians' discussions on the periodization of Chinese history have achieved great results. This book synthesizes all new scientific achievements in these aspects, and adopts the views agreed upon by most Soviet scholars on many controversial theoretical issues, forming a new system, making this book the latest and most complete work in ancient history.

    The central issue of the first volume is the emergence and development of slavery, and the most important and complex issue in this issue is the nature and formation process of slavery in the ancient Orient. On this issue, the authors forcefully argued on the basis of summarizing a large amount of historical materials that the slave-owning relationship was the dominant production relationship in ancient Oriental countries. However, in the ancient Orient, the slave system had a domestic nature, and free commune members still played an important role in production. The authors attach great importance to the issue of productivity, especially the improvement of production tools. From the relevant chapters, people can clearly see how the ancient Egyptians gradually mastered copper, bronze and iron tools. The authors correctly believe that class struggle is the driving force of the entire history of slave society, therefore, the resistance struggle of the people's masses has been given due attention in the ancient Oriental history section. For example, Chapter 6 of this book gives a profound explanation of the class struggle in the ancient Sumerian state of Lagash. Chapter 9 gives a concrete explanation of the uprising of the lower-level people in the Middle Kingdom era, and puts forward new insights on the period when the uprising occurred, believing that "there are many important reasons to show that the uprising occurred before the rule of the Twelfth Dynasty," while in the past it was generally believed that the uprising occurred at the end of the Middle Kingdom (1750 BC). In addition, the outstanding contributions made by Soviet scholars to the history of ancient slave states in the South Caucasus and Central Asia have also been well summarized in this book.

    This book gives due attention to the early historical development of China. The authors pointed out in the general preface to the whole book that among the ancient civilized countries in the world, China was the first country to enter feudal society. In the first chapter of this book, the authors described in detail the discovery of the Chinese ape-man and its great significance.

    This book uses two chapters to describe the early history of slave-owning relations in China. Chapter 17, "Ancient China (before the twelfth century BC)," mainly describes the Yin and Shang Dynasties. The authors believe that the disintegration of Chinese primitive society, the emergence of slave-owning relations, and the emergence of the state all began with the establishment of the Shang state. The title of Chapter 26 is "Chinese Slave-Owning Society (12th to 6th centuries BC)". In this chapter, the authors narrate the history of the Zhou Dynasty from the very beginning to the end of the Spring and Autumn Period. The authors believe that the level of productivity in this period was greatly improved compared with the previous period. In this period, the state apparatus of the slave-owning system was also gradually consolidated; in terms of land relations, the large land ownership system was in the process of development. The authors believe that until the Spring and Autumn Period, China's slave-owning system was still developing. The authors noticed the class struggle of this period recorded in "Zuo Zhuan". The authors believe: "However, the people's uprisings in this period were small in scale and did not lead to the destruction of the slave-owning mode of production." (Page 862). Judging from the following volumes, the opinion of the editors of this book on the periodization of Chinese history is that the slave-owning period in Chinese history was from the beginning of the Yin Dynasty to the end of the Han Dynasty, and the Chinese feudal system began in the early third century AD.

    Regarding the issue of the nature of ancient Chinese society and the periodization of history, Chinese historians and progressive historians abroad are conducting research and展开 discussions. However, judging from the contents of these two chapters and the bibliography attached to the book, the authors have mastered a large amount of original materials and the research results of Chinese and foreign scholars, and have conducted a relatively in-depth analysis and research. These two chapters, like other chapters in this book, are of high scientific value and deserve our attention.

    India also occupies two chapters in this book. Chapter 16, "Ancient India," discusses the primitive commune system in India and the ancient civilization in the Indus River basin (Harappa culture). Chapter 25, "Ancient India from the fifteenth to sixth centuries BC," discusses the Vedas, the occurrence of slave-owning relations, the formation of the state, the formation of the hierarchy, the ancient Indian epic and the ancient Indian religion. The authors pointed out that India is one of the oldest birthplaces of world civilization. The authors cautiously assume that the early states in the Ganges River basin in North India occurred in the second half of the second millennium BC. In the first few centuries of the first millennium BC, the political center moved east to the middle reaches of the Ganges River. At the beginning of the sixth century BC, the Magadha state rose; it was on this basis that the Maurya Dynasty established the first slave-owning state on an all-India scale in the fourth century BC.

    Chapter 15 of this book discusses "The Early Slave States in the Aegean Region." Regarding the issue of the periodization of the Crete Island part and the mainland part of this culture, the discussion is extremely chaotic in general bourgeois works. This book summarizes the latest research results in this area in recent years, and makes a clear argument for the nature of Cretan and Mycenaean societies - early slavery, which is one of the most brilliant parts of this book. Based on a large amount of materials, the authors believe that the demise of Mycenaean society was not simply the invasion of external enemies, but the main reason was that the class contradictions within this society had become increasingly acute.

    Chapters 28 and 29 describe the ancient Greek history in the first half of the first millennium. The discussion in this section is both highly generalized and combined with sufficient specific historical materials. The authors affirm that Greek society in the Homeric era (11th to 9th centuries BC) had not gone beyond the primitive commune system, while the period from the 8th to 6th centuries BC was the formation period of the Greek slave state (city-state). This book also gives a full explanation of the characteristics of classical city-states and classical slave societies. The authors believe that classical city-states and classical slave societies were formed under the conditions that the economy in the Mediterranean region had achieved great development. At that time, not only in Egypt, in Western Asia Minor and Asia Minor, but also in Greece, the level of productivity development was incalculably higher than the level of productivity development when the first batch of Oriental class societies were produced. In this stage of Greek history, the authors gave a detailed discussion of the two most important city-states, Sparta and Athens.

    The successive publication of the Chinese translation of this World History will make a great contribution to our research on world history and our study of Marxist-Leninist theory.

    历史科学进展的丰碑
    介绍“世界通史”第一卷
    苏联科学院主编北京编译社译三联书店出版　周怡天　朱龙华  齐思和  李开物
    苏联科学院主编的十卷本“世界通史”，是世界上第一部以马克思列宁主义为指导思想阐明人类社会发展过程的、规模巨大的、综合性的世界通史。为了完成这项重大科学任务，十年来苏联科学院调动了全国各个历史部门的著名专家，组成以苏联科学院通讯院士茹可夫为首的编辑委员会，进行编写工作。第一卷于1955年出版，现已出到第五卷。
    这部全面地叙述了人类历史发展的世界通史，总结了以前历史家的全部研究成绩，并且把这门学问的水平推进到空前的高度。这部著作的出版是全世界史学界的大事。现在中译本第一卷已经出版，其余各卷也将陆续出版。像这部长达千万字左右的世界通史被翻译成中文，也是我国史学界的一件大事。
    以前一些资产阶级历史家，也曾编写过多卷本的世界通史。但是，这些书的撰稿人，都是站在资产阶级立场，运用唯心主义的方法，把人类历史看成一系列无规律可循的偶然事件的续演，在其中起主导作用的只是一些统治阶级的特殊人物，而劳动人民是没有任何地位的。他们把资本主义的存在看成是永恒的，来为资产阶级的统治进行辩护。就其范围而论，这些书主要地是西方各国史的堆集，就是东欧各国也被安放在附庸地位，更不必说欧洲以外的国家了。
    这部十卷本的世界通史，原书是用十六开巨型大本印成的，每卷长达八九百页。第一、二卷叙述原始公社和古代世界（从最初到公元四、五世纪），第三、四卷叙述中世纪史（从公元五世纪到十七世纪中叶），第五、六、七卷叙述近代史（从十七世纪英国资产阶级革命到伟大的十月社会主义革命），最后三卷叙述现代史（直到世界第二次大战的结束）。叙述的范围是十分全面的。亚非各国的历史，以及美洲和澳洲原始居民的历史，都被恢复了它们应有的地位。各卷除正文外，都附有专为本书设计的采色历史地图和精美的插图。书后附有大事年表，参考书目和索引等。编制的完备，印刷的精美，都是前所未有的。
    这部世界通史，运用马克思列宁主义的历史唯物主义的观点，对全世界人类的历史发展进行了综合分析。本书每卷的序言，即是各个历史阶段的发展规律的说明。这些说明总结了苏联史学界最新的研究成果，是每卷最精采的部分之一。
    以下再专就已译成中文的第一卷作一简单介绍。
    第一卷正文前有两篇序言。一是“总编辑部的话”，这是全书的总序。在这篇长达二十五页的序言中，作者把人类社会发展的基本规律及其主要阶段作了一个简明的概述。文中指出：原始公社制是全体人类共同经历的最长的阶段，奴隶制最早出现于埃及、两河流域和印度，而封建制则首先产生于中国。资产阶级革命首先是在西欧和北美取得胜利的，而现代史的出发点则是苏联伟大的十月革命的胜利。这是世界史的主要线索。但是，在同一个经济基础上可以有各式各样的发展类型，每一个阶段都存在着先前社会型态的残余和新经济关系的萌芽，而且在每个时代中各民族的社会发展是极不平衡的，也不是所有的民族都经历一切社会发展阶段。在这篇总序中，作者使我们对于整个人类历史发展的洪流，有了一个清晰的了解。本卷除了全书的总序外，又有“第一卷序言”。在这篇序言中，作者阐明了本卷中所叙述的长达数十万年的历史发展的理论问题，其中包括地球上不同地区的原始社会发展的主要阶段、剥削的产生和对抗性社会的产生等重大问题。本卷正文共分为四编，二十九章。全书从最初叙述到公元前六世纪。第一卷的结构大致如此。
    由于地下资料的不断发现和理论研究的迅速进展，近二三十年来，关于古代世界史的研究有巨大的发展。例如，由于玛里铭文的发现，古代东史家把著名的汉谟拉比法典的年代往下推迟了一百五十年。由于古文字学家发现了克里特古代文字的读法，历史家遂明确了古代克里特的社会性质。前些年苏联学者关于古代东方社会性质的讨论，近年来中国史学界关于中国历史分期的讨论，都获得很大成绩。本书综合了这些方面一切新的科学成果，对于许多聚讼纷纷的理论问题，采纳了目前大多数苏联学者所同意的看法，组成了一个新的体系，使得这本书成为目前古代史中最新的、最完备的著作。
    第一卷的中心问题是奴隶制的产生和发展，而在这个问题中最重要而又最复杂的问题是古代东方奴隶制的性质和形成的过程。关于这个问题，作者在概括了大量史料的基础上有力地论证了，奴隶占有制关系是古代东方各国的主导的生产关系。但是，在古代东方，奴隶制关系具有家内性质，自由的公社成员在生产中仍起着重要作用。作者十分重视生产力状况的问题，首先是生产工具的改进问题。从有关的章节中，人们可以清楚地看出，古代埃及人怎样逐步地掌握了铜、青铜和铁工具的过程。作者正确地认为阶级斗争是奴隶社会全部历史的动力，因此，人民群众的反抗斗争在古代东方史部分得到了应有的重视。例如，本书第六章对古苏美尔国家拉伽什的阶级斗争作了深刻的说明。第九章对中王国时代下层人民群众的起义作了具体的说明，而且对起义发生的时期提出了新的见解，认为“有很多重要根据表明起义发生在第十二王朝统治以前”，而过去一般认为起义发生于中王国末期（公元前1750年）。此外，苏联学者对南高加索和中亚细亚的古代奴隶制国家的历史研究所作出的卓越的贡献，在本书中也得到了很好的总结。
    本书对于中国早期的历史发展给予了应有的重视。作者在全书的总序中指出，在世界各文明古国中，中国是最早进入封建社会的国家。在本书的第一章中，作者详细地叙述了中国猿人的发现及其重大意义。
    本书用了两章的篇幅叙述中国奴隶占有关系的早期历史。第十七章“远古的中国（公元前十二世纪以前）”，主要地是叙述殷商时期。作者认为，中国原始社会的瓦解，奴隶占有关系的出现，国家的产生，都是从商国的建立已经开始了的。第二十六章的题目是“中国的奴隶占有制社会（公元前十二至六世纪）”。在这一章中，作者把周代的历史从最初叙述到春秋末年。作者认为这个时期生产力的水平较以前有了很大的提高。在这个时期，奴隶占有制的国家机构，也日渐巩固；在土地关系方面，大土地占有制正在发展的过程中。作者认为，直到春秋时期，中国的奴隶占有制仍在发展。作者注意到了“左传”中所记载的此时期的阶级斗争。作者认为：“但是，这一时期的人民起义，规模不大，也没有导致奴隶占有制生产方式的毁灭。”（第八六二页）。从以下几卷看来，本书编者对于中国历史分期的意见是，从殷初到汉末是中国历史上的奴隶占有制时期，而中国的封建制度是从公元三世纪初年开始的。
    关于中国古代社会性质和历史分期的问题，中国史学界和国外进步历史家都正在进行研究，展开讨论。但是，从这两章的内容和书后所附的参考书目看来，作者掌握了大量的原始资料和中外学者的研究成果，并且进行了比较深刻的分析研究。这两章和本书其他各章一样，都是具有很高的科学价值，值得我们重视的。
    印度在本书中也占着两章的篇幅。第十六章“远古的印度”，论述了印度的原始公社制度和印度河流域的远古文明（哈拉巴文化）。第二十五章“公元前十五至六世纪的古代印度”，论述了吠陀、奴隶占有制关系的发生、国家的形成、等级制度的形成、古代印度的史诗和古代印度的宗教等问题。作者指出，印度是世界文明的最古发源地之一。作者审慎地假定：北印恒河流域的早期国家发生在公元前二千纪的后半叶。在公元前一千纪最初几个世纪中，政治生活中心东移到了恒河流域中部。公元前六世纪初，摩揭陀国家崛起；就在这个基础上，孔雀王朝在公元前四世纪成立了印度历史上第一个全印规模的奴隶占有制国家。
    本书第十五章论述“爱琴海区域的早期奴隶制国家”。关于这个文化的克里特岛部分和大陆部的分期问题，在一般资产阶级著作中，论述都是极端混乱的。本书总结了近年来在这方面研究的最新成果，对于克里特和迈锡尼社会性质——早期奴隶制作出了明确的论证，这是本书最精彩的部分之一。作者根据大量资料认为，迈锡尼社会的灭亡不单纯是外部敌人的入侵，主要原因仍在于这个社会内部的阶级矛盾已日趋尖锐。
    第二十八、二十九两章叙述第一千纪前半期的古代希腊史。本部分的论述既具有高度的概括性，又结合了充分的具体史料。作者肯定荷马时代（公元前十一至九世纪）的希腊社会还没有超出原始公社制度，而在公元前八至六世纪时期则是希腊奴隶制国家（城邦）的形成时期。本书对于古典城邦和古典奴隶制社会的特征也作了充分的说明。作者认为，古典城邦和古典奴隶制社会是在地中海地区经济已获得巨大发展的条件下形成的。那时不仅在埃及，在西亚细亚和小亚细亚，而且也在希腊，生产力发展水平都已经无可估量地高出于首批东方阶级社会产生那时候的生产力发展水平。在这一阶段的希腊历史中，作者对斯巴达和雅典两个最重要的城邦作了详细的论述。
    这部世界通史的中文译本的陆续出版，对于我们研究世界历史，学习马克思列宁主义理论，都将会有着巨大的贡献。
