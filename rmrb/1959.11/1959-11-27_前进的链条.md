Title: The Chain of Progress

    The image of a chain has been repeated in my mind many times. When I was young, riding a bicycle and the chain broke, the bike "broke down." I first understood that to make the bike move forward smoothly, I had to protect the interlocked chain links from breaking. A few years ago, I went to an oil mining area. On the drilling platform of a deep exploratory well more than 3,000 meters deep, I watched the drill table spinning the huge drill pipe at high speed, rumbling and shaking the entire drilling platform, and it was also driven by a huge chain. This chain was also flying and surging, one link tightly interlocked with another. I have also seen the tracks of tanks and tractors, which are also interlocked link by link, moving forward section by section, carrying the entire vehicle body and machine body forward.
    However, my view of the mass-based competition movement on the industrial front as forming a "chain of progress" has only come about recently.
    I remember when the "Conference of Heroes" had just closed, I was excitedly thinking: the heroes are about to return to their respective posts, and soon there will be a greater upsurge in the mass movement. Don't we often regard heroes as "locomotives"? Having "presented treasures" and "learned from experience" at the conference, especially the heroes who have further improved their ideological awareness at the meeting, aren't they like locomotives with added coal and water, about to step on the gas even more, leading the train of the mass movement to move forward faster? However, if we think further about the characteristics of the current mass movement, the image of this "train" can no longer fully encompass it. Especially when I think of the complete and touching slogan of "learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, surpass the advanced, and help the backward," an image of a huge chain of mass movement tumbling forward emerges before my eyes.
    "Help the backward" is a fresh way of putting it. Changing "backward" to "lagging behind" is not just a change in name. In any mass movement, there are always three parts: the advanced, the intermediate, and the backward. This is the law of the movement itself. However, the two words "lagging behind" more accurately reflect the essence of the part of our working class that is temporarily lagging behind than the two words "backward." Today, apart from those with hostile thoughts who are mixed in our ranks, anyone who is temporarily in a backward state is striving to move forward under the encouragement of the Party's general line, doing their best to learn from the advanced, catch up with them, and strive to surpass them. Therefore, "lagging" is also willing to "advance," which can more accurately and completely reflect their appearance.
    Looking through the entire mass-based competition movement, everyone who participates in the competition seems to be a link in the entire chain. Each link, like the links on a machine chain, seems to have two loops, front and back: one is connected to the people ahead who are more advanced than themselves, catching up with and surpassing them; the other is connected to the people behind, helping and driving them forward with effort. Such mutual connection one by one organically connects the entire advanced, intermediate, and backward, moving forward together. This is the characteristic of the mass-based competition movement in our era. It shows that in our working class, although there will always be opposition between the advanced and the backward, this is an opposition that constantly promotes progress through struggle, just like the various links in the chain, although there is tension between them, it is these tensions that make it roll forward continuously.
    The chain of competitive movement composed of people who strive for progress is not completely the same as the mechanical chain. This is not a mechanical combination of parts, but an organic combination of cells full of subjective initiative. It has both links like Zhang Shuluan, who turned from backward to advanced, and links like the old hero Meng Tai, who is always advanced. In this chain, the advanced and the backward will not be a mechanical cyclical movement, but the backward will become advanced, and the advanced will become even more advanced. Our great Party is precisely the axis and driving force for launching the forward movement of this entire "chain." Without the leadership of the Party, or if it is disconnected from the entire chain, even the most advanced link will lose its effect. The appearance of this "chain" proves the deepening and broadening of the mass movement to build socialism: whether advanced or backward, they are all making great efforts to strive for progress, and the advanced and the backward have been closely linked together.
    The heroes have returned to their posts, and they will promote the close integration of this huge chain, and will make this chain move forward even faster. And the car of the entire history will also move forward faster with the movement of this "chain"!

    前进的链条
    施尔武
    链条的形象，在我脑子里重复过许多次。幼时骑自行车，链子断了，车子“抛锚”，第一次懂得了要使车子顺利前进，必须保护这环环紧扣的链条不使它中断。几年前到一个石油矿区去，在一口三千多米的深探井的钻台上，看着钻盘带着巨大的钻杆飞速旋转，轰轰作响，震得整个钻台发颤，而带动它的也是一根巨大的链条。这链条也是那样一环紧扣一环的飞舞奔腾。我也看到过坦克车和拖拉机上的履带，它们也都是一环紧扣一环的，节节相联着向前运动，把整个车身和机身带向前去。
    但是，我对工业战线上的群众性的竞赛运动，形成一个“前进的链条”的看法，却是在最近。
    记得“群英会”刚刚闭幕的时候，我曾兴奋地想到：英雄们就要回到各自岗位上去了，不久必定会掀起一个群众运动的更大高潮。我们不是经常把英雄们看作
  “火车头”么？经过在大会上“献宝”、“取经”，特别是在会上更加提高了自己思想觉悟的英雄们，不正像是加添了燃煤和水的火车头一样，将要更加开足马力，带着群众运动的列车更快地前进吗？但是，如果进一步想到当前群众运动的特点时，这“列车”的形象，就不再能完全地概括它了。特别一想到“学先进、赶先进、超先进、帮后进”这个完整而又触动人心的口号，眼前便浮现出一个巨大的群众运动的链条在翻腾向前的形象来。
    “帮后进”，这是一个新鲜的提法。把“落后”改称作“后进”，这不只是一个名称的改变。在任何一个群众运动中，总有先进的、中间的、落后的三部分人。这是运动本身的规律。但是，“后进”两个字，却比“落后”两个字，更能确切地反映出我们工人阶级队伍中，暂时处于落后状态的那一部分人的实质。今天，除了混身在我们队伍中的那些具有敌对思想的人以外，任何暂时处在落后状态的人，在党的总路线的鼓舞下，都在力求前进，都在尽最大努力向先进者学习，追赶他们并力求超过他们。因此“后”又愿意“进”，才能更准确、更完全地反映出他们的面貌来。
    透过整个群众性的竞赛运动去观察，投入到竞赛中的每一个人都好像是整个链条中的一个环节。每个环节，同机器上的链条的环节一样，好像也都具有前后两个环扣：一个同前面的比自己先进的人相联，追赶而又超过他们；另一个同后面的人相联，用力帮助并带动他们向前。这样一个一个地相互衔接，就使整个先进的、中间的、落后的统统有机地连结起来，共同前进。这便是我们这个时代群众性的竞赛运动的特征。它说明着，在我们工人阶级队伍中，虽然永远会有先进同落后的对立，但这是经过斗争不断推动前进的对立，正像链条中的各个环节之间，虽然彼此都有着拉力，但它却靠了这些拉力不断滚滚向前是一样的。
    由力争上游的人们所组成的竞赛运动的链条，并不完全相同于机械上的链条，这不是一个个零件的机械的组合，而是充满了主观能动性的细胞的有机的组合。它既有着张淑鸾那样后进变作先进的环节，也有着老英雄孟泰那样永远先进的环节。在这个链条里先进同落后不会是机械循环式的运动，而是后进变先进，先进的更先进。我们伟大的党，正是发动这整个“链条”向前运动的轴心和动力。离开了党的领导，或者是同整个链条脱节，即使是最先进的环节，也将失去它的作用。这“链条”的出现，证明着建设社会主义的群众运动的深化和广化：不论先进的后进的都在鼓足干劲力争上游，先进的同后进的已经密切地连结起来了。
    英雄们回到岗位上去了，他们将促进这个巨大的链条的密切结合，将使这个链条更加飞舞奔腾地前进。而整个历史的车子，也将随着这“链条”的运动更快的向前！
