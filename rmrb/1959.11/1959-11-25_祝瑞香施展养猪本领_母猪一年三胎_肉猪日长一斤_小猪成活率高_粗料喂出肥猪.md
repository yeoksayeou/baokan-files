According to the Zhejiang Daily, Zhu Ruixiang, deputy director of the "July 1st" Livestock Farm in Dipu Commune, Anji County, Zhejiang Province, a model pig farmer, and a Communist Party member, raises pigs that gain more than one pound of meat per day, and has sows that produce three litters a year, setting an example of raising pigs in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical.

Zhu Ruixiang's four piglets, weighing 14.5 catties each, grew to 140 catties in four months, breaking the conventional wisdom that it takes eight months for a pig to reach 120 catties. Ten experimental meat pigs gained an average of 1.06 catties of meat per head per day, about twice as much as pigs raised by ordinary feeders. There is also an "A Da," which has been raised for two years and three months and already weighs more than 960 catties. There are also four experimental sows that can produce three litters a year. They gave birth to 37 piglets in April, and 51 piglets in August. After the second litter, they were bred again within eight days, and are now all pregnant, expected to give birth to a third litter in late December.

Zhu Ruixiang is 55 years old and has 37 years of pig-raising experience. Her pig-raising experience was not valued in the old society, but after liberation, she received the Party's attention and support. After the establishment of the commune, the commune set up a livestock farm, which gave her even more "room to use her talents." From then on, she wholeheartedly used all her skills. Zhu Ruixiang cares for and takes care of the pigs every moment, truly cherishing them like treasures. When it is cold, she puts straw on the pigsty floor. Even if there is only a small hole in the sty that can let in a wisp of wind, she will plug it. When it is hot, she bathes the pigs with cold water during the day and washes the pigsty with cold water to cool it down. In the evening, she smokes the pigsty to drive away mosquitoes and prevent them from biting the pigs. She usually works until late at night, not resting until the pigs are asleep.

"Pay attention to selecting breeds, rationally matching feed, feeding diligently and finely, giving less and adding frequently, feeding in stages, managing patiently, and taking care meticulously" are Zhu Ruixiang's main experiences in raising pigs that grow fast and have high survival rates.

Zhu Ruixiang attaches great importance to selecting and retaining piglets. She says: "Growing rice requires selecting rice seeds, and raising pigs requires choosing pig breeds." When selecting, choose pigs with small heads, large noses, medium ears, and wide mouths (pointed-mouth pigs like to dig holes and are not easy to raise); broad and straight backs, and short and thick necks. She says that pigs with short necks eat feed in order, from near to far, and will not be picky eaters; pigs with long necks eat feed from far to near and are not willing to eat poor feed. When selecting pigs, also choose those with big bellies, but not dragging on the ground, and male piglets should have even bigger bellies; the pig's four legs should be straight, with the hind legs slightly higher than the front legs, and the tail should not be too long. She says: If there is a hard grain at the tip of the tail, the pig will definitely gain weight quickly.

"Diligent feeding and fine feeding, growing one day at a time." To make pigs gain weight quickly, feeding is a central link. Zhu Ruixiang said: Pigs eat hundreds of kinds of grass, only fearing that people won't find them. Some people think that pigs cannot be raised without refined feed, which is unfounded. She said: I have raised pigs for decades, almost all using wild vegetables and wild grass for feed. The key lies in rational feed matching, cutting it finely, cooking it thoroughly, mixing it evenly, and kneading it into a paste. When feeding, pay attention to four things: first, look at the size of the pig; second, look at the quality of digestion; third, look at whether it likes to eat dry or thin feed; and fourth, look at the length of its legs. Pay attention to feeding coarse feed before refined feed. Because pigs are hungry, they like to eat even coarse feed, and after they have eaten almost enough, feed them some refined feed. At the same time, when feeding, give less and add frequently, and do not eat too full, mastering about 80% is enough.

From piglets to large pigs, the feeding rule is: refined feed at both ends, coarse feed in the middle. Generally divided into three stages. The first is the piglet stage (within 30 catties), and refined feed should be fed appropriately, with some salt added, and cooked into a porridge. For piglets weighing less than ten catties or who are thin, some small fish and crabs should be cooked and mixed into the feed to make the piglets grow meat and bones. Within 15 catties, feed six times a day, and once in the middle of the night; from 15 catties to 30 catties, reduce to four or five times, and still feed once in the middle of the night. What should be paid attention to in this stage is that piglets cannot lose weight after weaning, and castration can only be performed when the body is in good condition, otherwise it will be more difficult to raise them well after castration. The second is the trough pig (frame pig) stage (30 catties to 100 catties), mainly feeding green coarse feed, and using as little or no refined feed as possible, but it must be ensured that the feed is diversified, with more than three kinds of grass mixed together each time. At this time, the number of feedings is reduced to three to four times. In winter, when the nights are long, put some cooked pig grass in the pig trough for the pigs to eat. At this time, salt should also be added to the feed when feeding pigs. The method is to sprinkle the salt on the surface of the feed after the pigs have eaten more than half of the feed, so that the pigs will eat all the feed in one breath. She said: Eating salt can help digestion, and will not "suffer from heatstroke" in hot weather. Pigs that eat salt have thick stomach walls and digest well, so they grow fast. The third is the large pig - fattening pig stage (100 catties to 150 catties). Mainly feed green coarse feed, but it must be full. However, about 40 days before sale (about 150 catties), in order to make it grow meat and oil, refined feed should be appropriately increased. Add another meal in the middle of the night, and try to feed the pigs fully, so that the effect of refined feed fattening can be achieved. At this stage, pigs should also be allowed to sleep more, preferably out of the light.

"There is no trick to raising pigs, meticulous care is the most important." She stays in the pigsty all day, often paying attention to observing the pig's movements, carefully listening to the pig's voice, and distinguishing the pig's "temperament" and "desires" from its movements and calls. She knows the "temperament" of each pig clearly. Zhu Ruixiang said that as long as you manage it well, the pig will be obedient. Therefore, the pigs she raises are named according to their characteristics, and they will wag their tails and come up to greet her as soon as she calls their names. At the same time, pay attention to the cleanliness and hygiene of the pigsty, and wash it at any time. The pigs she raises have never been sick, and the piglet survival rate is very high, reaching more than 96%.

Currently, Zhejiang Province is promoting Zhu Ruixiang's advanced breeding experience, and Anji County has launched a campaign to learn from Zhu Ruixiang, catch up with Zhu Ruixiang, and surpass Zhu Ruixiang. (Attached picture)

    祝瑞香施展养猪本领
    母猪一年三胎　肉猪日长一斤  小猪成活率高　粗料喂出肥猪
    据浙江日报消息　浙江省安吉县递铺公社“七一”畜牧场副场长、养猪模范、共产党员祝瑞香养猪每天长肉一斤以上，母猪一年三胎，树立了养猪多快好省的榜样。
    祝瑞香养的四头十四斤半的小猪，四个月就长到一百四十斤，打破了养猪一百二十斤一定要八个月的常规。十头试验肉猪，平均每头每天长肉一点零六斤，比一般饲养员养的猪，每天增重高一倍左右。还有一头“阿大”，养了二年零三个月，体重已经达到九百六十多斤。还有四头试验母猪，一年可产三胎，4月份生了小猪三十七头，8月份又生小猪五十一头，二胎生下后，八天内又配上了种，目前已头头满怀，预计在12月下旬又可生第三胎。
    祝瑞香今年五十五岁，有三十七年养猪经验。她的养猪经验在旧社会根本得不到重视，解放之后才受到党的重视和支持。公社化以后，公社办起了畜牧场，更使她“英雄有用武之地”。从此，她全心全意施展出全身本领。祝瑞香每时每刻都在关心猪，照顾猪，真是爱猪如宝。天冷了，给猪栏垫上草。栏里那怕是只有能够穿进一丝风的小洞，她也要把它塞好。天热了，她白天用凉水给猪洗澡，用凉水冲洗猪栏，使猪栏降温。晚上在猪栏熏烟驱蚊，不让蚊子咬猪。平时工作到深夜，一直到猪睡好了，自己才休息。
    “注意选种，合理配料，勤喂细饲，少给勤添，分段饲养，耐心管理，细心护养”，这是祝瑞香养猪长肉快、成活率高的主要经验。
    祝瑞香对选留仔猪十分重视，她说：“种田要选稻种，养猪要挑猪种”。选时要挑头小、鼻大、耳中等、嘴阔的（尖嘴巴猪喜掘洞，不易养大）；背阔而平直，颈短而粗。她说，颈短的猪吃料有次序，由近而远，不会挑食吃；颈长的猪吃料由远而近，不大肯吃差的饲料。选猪还要选肚大的，但不要拖地，雄小猪更要肚大；猪的四腿要正直，后腿略高于前腿，尾巴不能太长。她说：如果尾巴尖端有一粒硬粒，这头猪一定长肉快。
      “勤喂细饲，日长夜大”。要使猪长肉快，喂养是一个中心环节。祝瑞香说：猪吃百样草，只怕人不找。有些人认为没有精饲料养不大猪，是没有根据的。她说：我自己养了几十年猪，几乎都用野菜、野草喂养。关键在于合理配料，切得细，煮得熟，调得匀，捏得糊。喂料时做到四看：一看猪大小，二看消化好坏，三看喜欢吃干还是吃稀，四看脚长短。喂时注意先粗后精。因为猪饿时饲料虽粗，也喜欢吃，吃到差不多时，再喂一些精料。同时，喂料时要少给勤添，不能吃得太饱，掌握八成左右就可以了。
    从小猪到大猪，喂料的规律是：两头精，中间粗。一般分三个阶段。第一是小猪阶段（三十斤以内），要适当喂给精料，加一些食盐，煮成粥状。十斤以内或身体瘦弱的小猪，还要弄些小鱼小蟹煮烘混在饲料里，使小猪长肉又长骨。十五斤以内每天喂六次，半夜喂一次；十五斤到三十斤减少到四、五次，半夜仍喂一次。在这个阶段中要注意的是小猪断奶以后不能掉膘，要养到体格较好时方可阉割，否则阉后更不易养好。第二是槽猪（架子猪）阶段（三十斤到一百斤），以饲青粗饲料为主，尽量少用或不用精饲料，但是一定要做到饲料多样化，每次都有三种以上的草料混在一起喂。这时喂料次数减到三至四次。冬天夜长，猪槽里要放点煮熟的猪草让猪吃。这时喂猪也要在饲料里加盐。办法是等猪吃去一半以上的饲料以后，把盐撒放在饲料面上，这样，猪便会一口气吃光饲料。她说：吃食盐能助消化，热天不会“发痧”。吃盐的猪胃壁厚，消化好，因而长得快。第三是大猪——肥猪阶段（一百斤至一百五十斤）。喂青粗饲料为主，但要吃得饱。但是到出售前的四十天左右
  （约一百五十斤左右），为了使它长肉、长油，要适当增加精饲料。半夜还要加喂一顿，尽量给猪吃饱，这样可得到精料催肥的效果。这个阶段还要让猪多睡觉，最好不见光。
    “养猪没啥巧，细心护养最重要”。她整天不离猪舍，经常注意观察猪的行动，细心倾听猪的声音，从行动和叫声中来辨别猪的“脾气”和“欲望”。她对每头猪的“脾气”，都摸得清清楚楚。祝瑞香说只要你管理得好，猪便会听话。因此她所养的猪，都按猪的特征取了名字，只要喊一声名字，就会摇头摆尾地迎上来。同时要注意猪栏的清洁卫生，做到随时冲洗。她养的猪从未生过病，小猪成活率很高，达96％以上。
    目前，浙江省正在推广祝瑞香的先进饲养经验，安吉县已展开学祝瑞香、赶祝瑞香、超祝瑞香的运动。（附图片）
