    Educate the Masses with the Spirit of Continuous Revolution
    The Party General Branch of the Quyang Brigade Guides Members to Strive for the Top in Everything and Catch Up with the Advanced in All Aspects

    (By our newspaper) The Party General Branch of the Quyang Brigade of Baofeng People's Commune in Huinong County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, due to its adherence to the thought of continuous revolution, strengthened the political and ideological education of cadres and members, and encouraged everyone to strive for the top in everything and catch up with the advanced in all aspects, has kept this brigade's various tasks at the forefront of all production teams in the commune.
    The Quyang Brigade is a Hui brigade. The soil here is severely salinized, the economic foundation is poor, the farming techniques were crude in the past, and the living standards of the members were relatively low. It was one of the poorer brigades among the seven production brigades in the commune. This spring, under the encouragement of national assistance and the superiority of the commune, the production enthusiasm of the brigade members soared unprecedentedly. They urgently demanded to no longer rely on state relief and grain supply, and to quickly change the face of the "poor brigade." The brigade party general branch fully assessed the members' aspirations, strengthened the political and ideological education of cadres and members, criticized the few cadres who were content with being in the middle, put forward the battle cry of "Surpassing Xinghuo (general teams), Catching up with Miaotai (rich teams), the face of the poor team must be changed," and actively led the members to bravely advance. As a result, a vigorous situation quickly emerged in various production activities. For example, this spring, in the work of building drainage ditches and improving soil salinization, more than 700 male and female members of the entire team participated in the battle, quickly changing the soil quality of more than 2,700 mu of severely salinized fields and some alkaline beaches. From spring planting to summer harvest this year, under the leadership of the party general branch, the team's drive was redoubled, always staying ahead of other teams, winning the achievement of an average yield of 2,600 mu of wheat, 46% higher than last year, and sideline production also increased significantly, bringing the team's production level basically up to the level of more affluent teams.
    After the publication of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee, the enthusiasm of the members was further encouraged. The party general branch led cadres and members in in-depth study and discussion. In order to counter the right-leaning opportunists' slander of the People's Commune and raise the red flag of the general line even higher, the members launched a vigorous mass movement centered on the "Three Autumns" work, making the autumn harvest not only fast but also well done. By the end of October, all 2,200 mu of stubble land in the team had been plowed, and some had been plowed twice; enough fertilizer had been accumulated for all of next summer's fields, and some of the fertilizer had even been sent to the fields before winter irrigation. In addition, 1.5 million catties of grass were stored. After completing these tasks, the members began to engage in winter large-scale water conservancy work.
    While completing their own tasks, the members also carried forward the spirit of communism and actively helped fraternal teams. For example, during the spring planting this year, after completing their tasks four days ahead of schedule, they supported the Yinhe Brigade with 30 plows and more than 10 pairs of oxen; during the summer harvest, they proposed "Four days of clean fields, ten days of clear threshing grounds." As a result, with everyone's efforts, harvesting was completed in three days, and threshing was completed in nine days. Therefore, more than 200 people were drawn to support other brigades in harvesting. After completing the task of selling 400,000 catties of summer grain to the state in six days, they also dispatched large carts to support two other brigades.
    Before the start of each task, the Quyang Brigade Party General Branch first convened party and league member meetings and general branch meetings to unify the thinking of the cadres, and then widely publicized it among the members, mobilizing the members to discuss it, so that everyone knew the significance and purpose of doing this task. In this way, the intentions of the leadership became the actual actions of the vast majority of members. At the same time, the general branch and various branch committee members also contracted packages by area, or directly served as production group leaders and professional group leaders, so that cadres could lead by example in various tasks. In this way, every task assigned would quickly form a vigorous mass movement.
    The Quyang Brigade Party General Branch also adhered to the method of long-term planning and short-term arrangements, according to the agricultural season and the order of production, with every seven to ten days as a production stage. Each stage has assignments, inspections, appraisals, and summaries. This established the thought of continuous revolution in cadres and members, and continuously improved the leadership level of the party general branch and the awareness of the members, thus creating a style of striving for advancement and striving for the top in various tasks. For example, before the spring planting this year, the commune required 30 carts of fertilizer per mu of spring wheat. In order to change the face of low yield, the team's cadres and members worked hard day and night to excavate fertilizer sources, applying 35 to 38 carts of fertilizer per mu, laying the foundation for this year's spring wheat harvest. After the summer harvest, in the movement to sell public grain, the party general branch put forward the slogan "State first, members second; collective first, individual second." It was originally stipulated that the members would be given one month's grain ration first, but the members voluntarily requested to divide half a month's grain ration first, and the surplus grain should be handed over to the state first, thus guaranteeing the early over-fulfillment of the task of selling public grain and state-unified purchased grain.
    In addition to relying on key points to gain experience, when new work began, the leading cadres of the Quyang Brigade Party General Branch and various production teams always took the lead in conducting pilot projects, and then convened observation and exchange meetings to promote the experience. For individual relatively backward production teams, they also adopted the approach of first going deep to discover problems, and then helping them specifically and patiently, which promoted the backward to catch up with the advanced, and the advanced to become more advanced. At the same time, in various production activities and tasks, attention was also paid to cultivating and rewarding advanced figures and activists in various fields, so that role models were established in various tasks. While grasping ideology, the Quyang Brigade Party General Branch also fiercely grasped technology. In the past, the level of agricultural technology here was relatively low. In order to change this situation, the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture was conscientiously implemented. This year, all brigade cadres planted experimental fields, and a scientific research station was established, absorbing cadres, veteran farmers, and technicians to jointly conduct comparative experimental research on dense planting, irrigation, fertilization, soil improvement, and field management, in order to guide the overall situation in a timely manner and improve the level of agricultural production. For example, this spring, a very bad piece of land in the Sixth Team was planted with wheat. Some members thought it was a waste of seeds and advocated simply plowing it up. However, during the growth process, the team cadres consciously gave this piece of land more processing and topdressing. As a result, this wheat field, which was originally a third-class seedling field, was upgraded to a first-class wheat field, and the yield was higher than that of the field that was originally considered to have good soil. This powerfully criticized the idea that field management, processing and topdressing were useless, and played a great role in promoting field management work. (Ma Yuping)

    用不断革命精神教育群众
    渠羊大队党总支引导社员事事争上游样样赶先进
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区惠农县宝丰人民公社渠羊大队党总支，由于坚持不断革命的思想，加强对干部和社员的政治思想教育，鼓励大家事事争上游，样样工作赶先进，使这个队的各项工作一直走在全公社各生产队的最前面。
    渠羊大队是一个回民队。这里土壤盐碱化严重，经济基础差，过去耕作技术粗糙，社员的生活水平也比较低，是公社七个生产大队中比较穷的一个大队。今年春天这个大队的社员在国家的扶助和公社优越性的鼓舞下，大家的生产积极性空前高涨，迫切要求不再依靠国家救济、供应口粮，迅速改变“穷队”的面貌。大队党总支充分估计了社员的这种愿望，加强了对干部和社员的政治思想教育工作，批判了少数干部甘居中游的思想，提出了“超星火（一般队）、赶庙台（富队），穷队面貌一定要改观”的战斗口号，积极领导社员奋勇前进。这样一来，在各项生产活动中，就很快地出现了轰轰烈烈的局面。如今年春天，在兴修排水沟、改良土壤盐碱化的工作中，全队有七百多名男女社员参加了战斗，使二千七百多亩盐碱化很重的田地和一些碱滩很快地改变了土质。从今年春播到夏收期间，这个大队在党总支领导下，干劲一鼓再鼓，一直走在其他队的前面，赢得了二千六百亩小麦平均亩产比去年增产46％的成绩，副业生产也有很大增长，使这个队的生产水平，基本上赶上了较富裕队的水平。
    党的八中全会的公报和决议发表以后，更加鼓舞了社员们的干劲。党总支领导干部和社员进行了深入的学习和讨论。社员们为了反击右倾机会主义分子对人民公社的诬蔑，更高地举起总路线的红旗，他们以“三秋”工作为中心，展开了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，使秋收不仅进行得快，而且进行得好。到10月底，全队二千二百多亩槎地已经翻完，有的还翻了两遍；已经积够了明年夏田全部需肥，有一部分肥料在冬灌前还送到地里。另外，还打贮草一百五十万斤。在完成这些工作以后，社员们又开始了冬季大兴水利工作。
    社员们在完成自己任务的同时，还发扬了共产主义精神，主动地帮助兄弟队。如在今年春播中，他们在提前四天完成任务以后，就以三十张犁、十多对牛，支援了银河大队；夏收中，提出“四天地净、十天场光”，结果在大家努力下，三天就收割完毕，九天就完成了打碾工作。于是，又抽出了二百多人支援别的大队收割。他们在六天中完成了四十万斤的夏粮交售任务以后，又抽调大车支援了另外两个大队。
    渠羊大队党总支在每一项工作开始前，都先召开党、团员会、总支会，统一干部的思想，然后在社员中广泛宣传，发动社员讨论，使大家知道做这件工作的意义和目的。这样一来，领导意图就变成了绝大多数社员的实际行动。同时，总支和各支部委员还分片包干，或直接担任生产组长和专业组长，使干部在各项工作中以身作则。这样，每件工作布置下去，很快就形成轰轰烈烈的群众运动。
    渠羊大队党总支还坚持了长计划短安排的办法，按照农事季节、生产的先后秩序，每七天到十天为一个生产阶段，每个阶段都有布置，有检查，有评比，有总结。这就在干部和社员中树立了不断革命的思想，使党总支的领导水平和社员的觉悟都不断地提高，因而在各项工作中都出现争先进、争上游的风气。如在今年春播以前，公社要求每亩春小麦施肥三十车，这个队为了改变低产的面貌，干部和社员日夜苦战，挖掘肥源，每亩施肥三十五车到三十八车，为今年春小麦丰收打下了基础。夏收以后，在交售公购粮运动中，党总支提出“先国家、后社员，先集体、后个人”的口号，本来规定先分给社员一月的口粮，但是社员们自动要求先分半月口粮，多余的粮食先交给国家，因此保证提前超额完成了交售公粮和国家统购粮食的任务。
    渠羊大队党总支和各生产队的领导干部，除了依托重点，取得经验以外，当新的工作开始，干部总是先带头试点，然后召开观摩交流会，推广经验。对于个别比较落后的生产小队，也采取了先深入发现问题，然后再具体耐心地帮助，这样就促使落后的赶先进，先进的更先进。同时，在各项生产活动和工作中，还注意培养和奖励各方面的先进人物和积极分子，使各项工作中都树立了标兵。在抓思想的同时，渠羊大队党总支还狠狠地抓了技术。过去这里农业技术水平比较低，为了改变这种情况，认真彻贯农业“八字宪法”，今年大队干部都种有试验田，并且成立了科学研究站，吸收干部、老农、技术员共同进行密植、灌水、施肥、土壤改良和田间管理等方面的对比试验研究，以便及时指导全面，提高农业生产水平。如在今年春天，第六小队有块很坏的地播种了小麦，有的社员认为是浪费籽种，主张干脆犁掉。但是，在生长过程中，队里干部有意识地给这块地多加工追肥。结果，这块原来是三类苗的麦田，升成一类麦田，产量比原来认为土壤好的田地还高。这有力地批判了那种认为田间管理、加工追肥不顶事的思想，对推动田间管理工作起了很大作用。（马玉平）
