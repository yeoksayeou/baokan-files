    The Radiance of the October Revolution Illuminates Our Path Forward
    Song Qingling

    Today, the working people of the world, together with the Soviet people, are celebrating the forty-second anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. They cheer the tremendous achievements of the Soviet people in building communism and hail the outstanding contributions made by the Soviet Union in the noble cause of defending world peace and striving for human progress. As this common festival of mankind arrives once again, we extend our heartfelt congratulations and respect to the Soviet people, their great leader the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet government.

    Forty-two years ago, the thunderous roar of the "Aurora" opened a new era in human history. In one-sixth of the world's landmass, the world's first proletarian-led country, where the working people were masters, was born. It brought tremendous encouragement and hope to the working people of all countries and all oppressed nations, especially the oppressed nations of the East.

    For forty-two years, the Soviet people, holding high the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have eliminated the system of exploitation of man by man, overcome all kinds of difficulties, greatly developed the economy, culture, science, and technology, and victoriously built the first socialist country in human history. The Soviet people have accomplished earth-shattering great deeds in a short historical period, pointing out the bright path to a happy future for all mankind.

    Today, the Soviet Union has entered a new stage of development – the period of comprehensively unfolding communist construction. The seven-year plan for the development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965, formulated by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, is the grand program for the Soviet Union to build communism. The realization of this plan will not only establish the material and technical basis for the Soviet Union's transition to communism, but will also ensure the decisive victory of the world socialist system in the peaceful economic competition with the world capitalist system. At present, the Soviet people are launching a nationwide competition campaign to strive for the early completion of the seven-year plan. At the same time, the Soviet people have made astonishing achievements in the great cause of mankind's conquest of the universe. In just two short years, the Soviet Union has successfully launched three huge artificial earth satellites and three cosmic rockets. The recently launched third cosmic rocket sent an automatic interplanetary station into the sky and took pictures of the far side of the moon. These facts fully demonstrate that the Soviet Union is climbing to the pinnacle of world science and technology. The brilliant achievements of Soviet science and technology have not only made inestimable contributions to world science, but also played a significant role in further strengthening and consolidating world peace. More importantly, the Soviet people, through their creative labor, have shown all mankind the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The Chinese people and all progressive humanity regard the brilliant victories achieved by the Soviet people as their own victories, and are proud and honored by them.

    The victory of the October Revolution pointed out the path for the Chinese revolution. The Chinese revolution is a continuation of the great October Socialist Revolution. The salvo of the October Revolution brought Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese people. The broad masses of Chinese working people, under the leadership of the vanguard of the Chinese working class – the Communist Party of China – waged heroic and unyielding struggles against all foreign reactionary forces and domestic reactionary rulers, and finally, in 1949, shook off the triple oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, liberated the mainland of the country, and established the People's Republic of China, enabling more than 600 million oppressed people of all ethnic groups in our country to be reborn. The great victory of the Chinese revolution is a victory for Marxism-Leninism, and it is the fruitful result of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, creatively applying the principles of Marxism-Leninism in combination with China's specific conditions. The radiance of the October Revolution will forever illuminate our path forward from one victory to another.

    This October, our people, together with the fraternal people of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. In just ten short years, the Chinese people, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, have rapidly achieved great victories in the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, enabling the social productive forces of our country to be thoroughly liberated and rapidly developed. The socialist construction of our country is continuing to develop by leaps and bounds. Under the brilliant illumination of the general line of the Communist Party of China to go all out, aim high, and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has emerged in our country, and the emergence of the people's communes, which have great vitality, is playing a huge role in promoting industrial and agricultural production in our country. Over the past ten years, China's industrial production has increased more than tenfold, agriculture has increased by one and a half times, and culture, education, science, and health have also flourished. The people's living standards have generally improved. At present, on the basis of last year's great leap forward, and inspired by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, the people of our country are more confident than ever in going all out with revolutionary vigor, striving to fulfill and overfulfill the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule this year, and striving to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products within ten years.

    The socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, has more than one-third of the world's population, and its territory spans Europe and Asia. The socialist countries have established a new type of fraternal relationship based on the common ideology of Marxism-Leninism and the common goal of building socialism and communism. They help and cooperate with each other to achieve common economic upsurge. At present, they are all accelerating the construction of socialism and communism, and their economies are developing rapidly. The realization of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan and the long-term plans for the development of the national economy of other socialist countries will greatly enhance the material strength of the socialist camp. At the same time, the unity among socialist countries is also increasingly consolidated.

    The great victories achieved by the Chinese people in the socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past decade are inseparable from the sympathy and support of the people of all countries in the world, the assistance of the fraternal socialist countries, and especially the assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union. The people of China and the Soviet Union have forged an unbreakable fraternal alliance, which has become a strong fortress for defending peace in the Far East and the world. In the past ten years, a brotherly relationship of cooperation has been established between China and the Soviet Union. In the socialist construction of our country, the Soviet Union has given our country tremendous brotherly assistance. During China's First Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union helped China build 166 projects, and in the past two years, according to new agreements between the two countries, it has continued to help China build 125 projects, and in the past ten years, it has sent more than 10,800 experts in economics, culture, and education to our country to assist in the work. The people of our country sincerely thank the Soviet people for their assistance to the socialist construction of our country. The people of our country, at all times, regard the consolidation of Sino-Soviet unity and the consolidation of the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union as our primary and sacred responsibility. We must protect this friendship and unity as we protect our own eyes. Any destructive plot of the enemy will be doomed to failure.

    At present, we are in the great era of "the East wind prevailing over the West wind." The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong and united. The movements of various countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to strive for and maintain independence and democracy are surging forward. The struggle of the people of the world against aggression and war and for the defense of peace is advancing victoriously. The forces of peace and progress are increasingly surpassing the forces of war and reaction. This fact is once again reflected in the success of Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States. Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States and his proposal to the United Nations General Assembly for complete and thorough disarmament have had a significant and positive impact on easing international tensions and safeguarding world peace. The people of our country express warm welcome and support for these new actions taken by the Soviet Union in the struggle to safeguard world peace. The people of our country will always stand with the Soviet people and wage a resolute struggle to safeguard world peace and ease international tensions.

    Today, on the occasion of the forty-second anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, let us shout:
    Long live the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!
    Long live the great unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!
    Long live the great unity in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live world peace!

    十月革命的光辉照耀着我们前进
    宋庆龄
    今天，全世界劳动人民和苏联人民一起，欢庆伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年。他们为苏联人民在共产主义建设中取得的巨大成就而欢呼，为苏联在保卫世界和平和争取人类进步的崇高事业中作出的卓越贡献而欢呼。当这个人类共同的节日又一次来临的时候，我们谨向苏联人民及其伟大的领导者苏联共产党和苏联政府致以衷心的祝贺和敬意。
    四十二年前，“阿芙乐尔”的春雷般的炮声，开辟了人类历史上的新纪元。在世界六分之一的土地上，世界上第一个无产阶级领导的、劳动人民当家作主的国家诞生了。它给世界各国劳动人民和一切被压迫民族，特别是东方被压迫民族带来了巨大的鼓舞和希望。
    四十二年以来，苏联人民高举着战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的光辉旗帜，在光荣的苏联共产党的领导下，消灭了人剥削人的制度，战胜了各种困难，大大地发展了经济、文化和科学技术，胜利地建成了人类历史上第一个社会主义国家。苏联人民在短短的历史时期中作出了惊天动地的伟大事业，给全人类指出了通往幸福未来的光明大道。
    今天，苏联已经进入了一个新的发展时期——全面展开共产主义建设时期。苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会制订的1959—1965年发展国民经济的七年计划，是苏联建设共产主义的宏伟纲领。这个计划的实现，不仅将建立起苏联向共产主义过渡的物质技术基础，而且也将使世界社会主义体系同世界资本主义体系的和平经济竞赛中取得决定性的胜利。目前，苏联人民正在展开全民性的竞赛运动，争取提前完成七年计划。同时，苏联人民在人类征服宇宙的伟大事业中已取得了惊人的成就。仅仅在短短的两年间，苏联就成功地发射了三个巨大的人造地球卫星，并且又成功地发射了三支宇宙火箭。最近发射的第三支宇宙火箭，把一个自动行星际站送上天空，拍摄了月球背面的照片。这些事实都充分地说明了苏联正在登上世界科学技术的顶峰。苏联科学技术的光辉成就，不仅对世界科学作出了无可估量的贡献，而且对进一步加强和巩固世界和平起着重大的作用。同时，更重要的是，苏联人民以自己的创造性的劳动，向全人类显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性。中国人民和全体进步人类都把苏联人民所获得的辉煌胜利看成是自己的胜利，并且为此而感到光荣和自豪。
    十月革命的胜利为中国革命指明了道路。中国革命是伟大的十月社会主义革命的继续。十月革命一声炮响，给中国人民送来了马克思列宁主义。中国广大的劳动人民，在中国工人阶级的先锋队——中国共产党的领导下，向国外的一切反动势力和国内的反动统治者进行了英勇不屈的斗争，终于在1949年挣脱了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的三重压迫，解放了全国大陆，建立了中华人民共和国，使我国六亿多被压迫的各族人民获得了新生。中国革命的伟大胜利，是马克思列宁主义的胜利，是中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的原理同中国的具体实际相结合的丰硕的果实。十月革命的光辉永远照耀着我们从一个胜利向另一个胜利前进。
    今年10月，我国人民同以苏联为首的社会主义国家兄弟人民一起庆祝了中华人民共和国诞生的十周年。在短短的十年中，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的正确领导下，迅速地取得了民主革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利，使我国社会生产力得到了彻底的解放和迅速的发展。我国的社会主义建设事业正在一日千里地继续向前发展。在中国共产党制订的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，在我国出现了工农业生产的大跃进，而具有伟大生命力的人民公社的出现，对促进我国工农业生产起着巨大的作用。十年来，我国的工业生产增长了十倍以上，农业增长了一倍半，文化、教育、科学和卫生事业也都在蓬勃发展。人民生活水平普遍提高。目前，我国人民正在去年大跃进的基础上，在中共八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，更加信心百倍地鼓足革命干劲，为争取在今年内提前三年完成和超额完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，为在十年内在主要工业品产量方面赶上和超过英国而奋斗。
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营拥有全世界三分之一以上的人口，它的土地横跨欧亚两洲。社会主义阵营各国，在马克思列宁主义的共同思想和建设社会主义与共产主义的共同目标的基础上，建立了新型的兄弟关系。它们之间互助合作、彼此支援，以求得共同的经济高涨。目前，它们都在加速建设社会主义和共产主义，它们的经济正在飞跃发展。苏联七年计划和其他社会主义国家发展国民经济的长期计划的实现，将大大增强社会主义阵营的物质力量。同时，社会主义国家之间团结也日益巩固。
    十年来，中国人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中所取得的伟大胜利，是同全世界各国人民的同情和支持，同社会主义阵营兄弟国家的援助，特别是我们伟大盟邦苏联的援助分不开的。中苏两国人民结成了牢不可破的兄弟同盟，这个同盟已成为保卫远东和世界和平的强大堡垒。在过去十年中，中苏两国之间建立了兄弟般合作关系。在我国社会主义建设中，苏联给予我国巨大的兄弟般的援助。苏联在我国第一个五年计划期间帮助我国建设一百六十六个项目，最近两年又根据两国间新的协议，继续帮助我国建设一百二十五个项目，并且在过去十年中，先后派遣了经济和文教方面的专家一万零八百多人，来到我国协助工作。我国人民衷心感谢苏联人民对我国社会主义建设事业的援助。我国人民不论在任何时候都把巩固中苏团结和巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结看成是我们首要的神圣的责任。我们要像保护自己的眼珠一样保护这种友谊和团结。敌人的任何破坏阴谋都要遭到失败。
    目前，我们正处在“东风压倒西风”的伟大时代，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营空前强大和团结；亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国争取和维护独立、民主的运动正在蓬勃高涨，全世界人民反对侵略和战争、保卫和平的斗争正在胜利前进。和平和进步的力量越来越显著地超过了战争和反动的力量。这个事实，又一次地在赫鲁晓夫同志访问美国的成功中反映出来。赫鲁晓夫同志访问美国，并且向联合国大会提出了全面彻底裁军的建议，对于缓和国际紧张局势和维护世界和平，产生了重大的良好的作用。我国人民对于苏联在维护世界和平的斗争中所采取的这些新的行动，表示热烈的欢迎和支持。我国人民任何时候都和苏联人民站在一起，为维护世界和平，为缓和国际紧张局势进行坚决的斗争。
    今天，当伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年之际，让我们高呼：
    伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟万岁！
    中苏两国人民伟大的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
