Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Yulin Prefecture has already harvested, threshed, and inspected over 1.17 million mu of double-cropping late rice, with an average yield per mu increasing by more than 60% compared to last year. Among them, more than 50,000 mu have a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. The entire prefecture has also seen four counties with large areas of high-yielding late rice.

This year, the 4 million mu of late rice in Yulin Prefecture grew vigorously and uniformly, with long ears and full grains. Local veteran farmers generally reflected that they had not seen such good rice crops in recent years.

From the start of late rice transplanting, a vigorous campaign to exceed production targets was launched for a bumper harvest. During the rush planting period, all people's communes concentrated and allocated labor, launching transplanting skill competitions, which enabled the entire prefecture to complete transplanting one solar term earlier than in previous years. This allowed the rice seedlings to spike and flower earlier, avoiding the invasion of the Cold Dew wind. Various localities extensively adopted high-quality indica rice varieties such as "Baotai Hong" and "Baishe Ai," and based on the experience of early rice yield increases, implemented rational close planting in accordance with local conditions.

In order to eliminate low-yield fields and achieve large-scale balanced growth, the people's communes also launched a mass movement of "low-yield catching up with high-yield, mountain slopes catching up with large flatlands, seedbeds catching up with main fields, and lean fields catching up with fertile fields." More than 170,000 cadres throughout the prefecture led the broad masses of commune members, implementing the "four togethers": eating, living, working, and holding meetings in the fields. Many areas organized remote field production teams or field work stations, setting up camps in the fields to carefully tend to mountain slopes and remote fields, enabling most of the low-yield fields, which accounted for about one-third of the entire prefecture, to catch up with ordinary fields, and some even caught up with high-yield fields. The 8,000 mu of low-yield fields in Xiangxi Commune, Rong County, known as "land of water and fire," achieved an average yield of 804 jin per mu, an increase of more than double the average yield of late rice last year.

The bumper harvest of late rice in Yulin Prefecture is also the result of overcoming the drought demon. After autumn, just as the late rice was mostly spiking and flowering, and some seedlings were in the critical stage of grain filling, a drought appeared, with the affected area in the entire prefecture reaching more than 190,000 mu. In order to overcome the drought, leading cadres at all levels went to the front lines of drought resistance, leading 130,000 people in fighting the drought day and night, ensuring that all affected rice seedlings were irrigated.

    广西玉林专区战胜旱灾
    百万亩晚稻增产六成
    据新华社讯　广西僮族自治区玉林专区已经收割脱粒验收的一百十七万多亩双季晚稻，平均亩产量比去年增加六成以上。其中，亩产千斤以上的有五万多亩。全专区还出现了四个晚稻大面积高产县。
    今年玉林专区四百多万亩晚稻长得茁壮整齐，穗长粒饱。各地老农普遍反映几年来未见过这样好的稻禾。
    从晚稻插秧开始，就为晚稻大丰收开展了一个轰轰烈烈的超包产运动。在抢插时期，各人民公社都集中调配劳动力，展开插秧能手竞赛，使全专区完成插秧的时间比往年提早一个节气，从而使禾苗提早抽穗扬花，避过了寒露风的侵袭。各地大量采用了“包胎红”、“白壳矮”等籼稻良种，并且根据早稻增产的经验，因地制宜地实行了合理密植。
    为了消灭低产田，做到大面积平衡增长，各人民公社还开展了“低产赶高产、山冲赶大垌、秧田赶本田、瘦田赶肥田”的群众运动。全专区有十七万多名干部，带领广大社员，实行吃、住、办公、开会四到田头。许多地区组织远田生产队或田间工作站，在田头安营扎寨，精心护理山冲远田，使得占全专区三分之一左右的低产田大部分赶上了一般田，有的还赶上了高产田。容县厢西公社号称“水火之地”的八千多亩低产田，平均亩产达到八百零四斤，比去年晚稻平均亩产量增加一倍还多。
    玉林专区晚稻大丰收，也是战胜旱魔的结果。入秋后，正当晚稻大部分抽穗扬花，部分禾苗含胎灌浆的关键时期，旱象出现了，全专区受旱面积达到十九万多亩。为了战胜干旱，各地领导干部亲临抗旱前线，带领十三万人日夜抗旱，使全部受旱禾苗得到了灌溉。
