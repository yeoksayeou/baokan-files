    Dawn Glows Red Over Wuhan
    By our reporters Xu Ben and Guo Shenrong

    The good news of Wuhan City completing its annual total output value ahead of schedule is like a brilliant dawn, reddening half the sky.

    Looking at the abundant fruits of labor, people can't help but recall the many inspiring deeds of diligent work.

    On the evening before "May Day" Labor Day, a dazzling red "囍" (double happiness) character was posted at the entrance of a club in Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO). People flocked inside to offer congratulations.

    During the wedding ceremony, the groom was absent-minded. When asked to recount their "love story," he seemed not to hear, as his attention was drawn to the flashing blue arc of the welding torch in the sky above the No. 2 blast furnace construction site. He thought, "I'm the only welder in the team. Tonight, the two water supply trunk lines must be connected. Without a welder, it won't work! If we don't finish tonight, tomorrow's construction will be affected; the 'May Day' gift won't be ready, and the team's leap forward plan will be difficult to achieve. This is unacceptable!" His mind was completely focused on the construction site. As soon as the wedding ended, he took his bride's hand, said a few simple words, and hurriedly changed into work clothes with her, heading together towards the blast furnace construction site.

    The shock brigade members fighting on the second-level platform of the blast furnace were working hard: the heavy pipe was erected, and Chen Qinchen, the shock brigade leader, was welding. His clothes were soaked with sweat, and he had only welded a small piece after a long time. How wonderful it would be to have a welder!

    The arrival of the newlyweds surprised everyone. The bride quickly took the welding torch from Old Chen and started working. A young man shouted, "What a pair of welders! Instead of going to the bridal chamber after their wedding, they come here to work. Is that proper?" That night, their arrival made the shock brigade members work even harder. The newlyweds were named Li Deliang and Zhang Fule, both welders.

    This is just a very ordinary example emerging in today's life. How many heroic figures of our time are creating unprecedented miracles! It is they who, with unparalleled speed, have moved forward the completion date of WISCO's blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces again and again; it is they who have erased all those "not" words that were once attached to Wuhan's name – no iron production, no steel production, no cement production, no chemical raw material production, unable to manufacture important machinery and equipment; it is they who, at great speed, completed this year's industrial production plan fifty-three days ahead of schedule.

    This is the fruitful result dedicated to the motherland by the workers of Wuhan, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line. It is the crystallization of their wisdom and strength. In the torrent of the Great Leap Forward, the famous workers, Ma Xueli and the other eight standard bearers, have emerged, quickly ascending the peak of the leap forward, and more people are surging up. They are all heroes and heroines on all fronts, loyal executors of the General Line, and blooming red flowers everywhere.

    Among these many heroes, Wu Lianghu, foreman of the freight car workshop of the Jiang’an Vehicle Factory, is an advanced worker shining with communist brilliance. Not only has he not produced a single defective product in the past ten years and has overfulfilled his plan every month, but even more commendable is that, for the sake of the collective cause, he selflessly helps others to advance together. He meticulously undertakes the work of center beam scribing, but when he finds that the quality of the next process – the drilling process – is not good, he rushes over, studies with the workers, and helps them make a template, which improves the quality of drilling. From this incident, he understood: "Relying on one person to work well cannot produce high-quality vehicles." "Help others, improve yourself, and let a hundred flowers bloom in the socialist garden of the motherland, so that spring will last forever." After that, he became more concerned about the production of others, and whenever he found difficulties, even in processes unrelated to him, he took the initiative to help. He went to other work groups to help with work three times, and finally made these work groups become advanced groups.

    Wu Lianghu has become a prominent banner in Wuhan. Workers in various factories take him as a model to learn from, and like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, countless Wu Lianghus have emerged. In the Jiang’an Vehicle Factory, where Wu Lianghu works, there are already more than a hundred. It is they who regard the difficulties of others as their own, and see helping others as their own responsibility. Thus, one leads ten, and ten lead a hundred, finally mobilizing the city's workers to create meritorious service for the continued leap forward this year. They understand: "A drop of water cannot stir up waves, and a brick cannot build a building. The socialist mansion needs everyone to build it." The tremendous power generated by this kind of thinking is a powerful response to those who cannot see the power of the masses.

    Take a look at Wang Duoying, who is eighteen years old! Her skillful hands knit gloves quickly, with fast needle insertion, fast needle passing, and fast cuff closing. She is considered a fast hand in the Xinghuo Knitting and Underwear Factory. But she is not satisfied with this situation. She wants to help others catch up with her. She went to help Yi Ganqing and proposed to compete with her. This surprised Xiao Yi. "Competition? My output is so low, can I compete with you?" Xiao Wang said, "You are thinking incorrectly. Competition is to jointly improve production levels, not for anything else." From then on, she often stayed with her competitor, telling her how to prepare for production, how to pass the needle, and how to check the machine parts, unreservedly imparting all her experience to her. Xiao Yi's output quickly increased, and the output of the whole group immediately doubled. In the third quarter, it was rated as an advanced group in the whole of Wuchang District.

    Wang Duoying was not satisfied. She saw that her group was advanced, but another group was lagging behind. How could this be?! When it was her turn to get off work and rest, she sneaked back into the workshop to help other groups work. She had quick eyes and a keen mind, and immediately set her sights on two "targets" with poor labor discipline and low output. After patiently helping them in terms of ideology and technology, the output of these two workers doubled, and they both became advanced producers in the factory. The production level of this group has also greatly improved. Everyone thanked her and praised Duoying for having a "heart that is the same inside and outside the group."

    This matter seems so ordinary, but in this ordinary act, there is such a profound meaning. They have no selfishness, but use the lofty goal of building socialism and communism as the yardstick for their actions. Because of this, they are always concerned about the difficulties of others, leading thousands of people to move forward bravely. It is also because of this that they always stand up in the face of difficulties and move forward by stepping on difficulties. Not to mention Ma Xueli, the adjuster of the Wuhan workers all know, from January to September this year, he put forward more than 300 rationalization proposals, and no difficulty has ever stumped him. There is also Zhou Shu, this sixty-year-old worker, what difficulties have ever defeated him? He is the machine tool foreman of the Wuchang Locomotive Depot of the Wuhan Railway Bureau. This year, the volume of railway transportation has increased rapidly, and the task of repairing locomotives at the locomotive depot has greatly increased. Therefore, the mechanical group, which is responsible for processing locomotive parts, is even more tense. Processing parts requires equipment, especially those long and large parts, which cannot be processed by large machines. Some people suggested asking the higher authorities for it, Zhou Shu said: "If there are difficulties, think of a solution. Asking the higher authorities for machines is not in line with the style of the Great Leap Forward." As a result, this "old hero" made a planer in just over ten days, overcoming the difficulty of processing large parts.

    There are thousands upon thousands of such figures in today's great era. They stand under the glorious banner of the Party's General Line and have created today's vibrant world. However, they are not satisfied and are continuing to exert their efforts to create an even brighter tomorrow. "The Great Leap Forward still needs to leap forward again, and next spring we will reach another level. 600 million people will work together, so we need not spend ten years to surpass England. " This is a heroic poem written by a machine repair worker at the Heavy Machine Tool Factory, and it is also the voice of the 300,000 workers in Wuhan. The heroic people of Wuhan are advancing towards greater victories with greater strides!

    朝霞红遍武汉天
    本报记者　徐奔　郭慎容
    武汉市提前完成全年总产值的喜讯，像灿烂的朝霞红遍了半个天。
    人们看看丰硕的果实，不由的想起许许多多辛勤劳动的动人事迹。
    “五一”劳动节前夕的晚上，武钢的一个俱乐部的门口，贴了一张耀眼的大红“喜”字。人群纷纷往里拥，都来表示祝贺。
    婚礼进行的时候，新郎心不在焉，大家要他俩报告“恋爱经过”，他好像没听见，原来窗外二号高炉工地上空一闪一闪的蓝色的电焊弧光把他吸引去了。他想，班里就我是电焊工，今晚要把两根供水干管接通，没电焊工怎么行！今晚干不完，明天施工就要受影响；“五一”节献礼献不成，班里的跃进计划也难实现。这还了得！？他的思想完全倾注到工地上去了；婚礼刚刚结束，他拉了拉新娘的手，简单地说了两句话，就急匆匆地同新娘换上工作服，一道奔向高炉工地。
    战斗在高炉第二层平台上的突击队员们正在紧张地忙碌着：沉甸甸的大管竖起来了，突击队长陈勤臣在焊接，衣衫被汗水浸透了，半天还是焊了一小块，来一名电焊工该多好啊！
    一对新婚夫妇的到来，惊动了大家。新娘迅速地从老陈手里接过焊把，干了起来。一位小伙子高声嚷道：“好一对电焊工，新婚不去洞房，却到这里来干活，像话吗？”这一夜，由于他俩的到来突击队员们干得更欢了。这一对新婚夫妇，男的叫李德亮，女的叫张福乐，都是电焊工。
    这只不过是今天生活中涌现的一件极平凡的事例。当代有多少英雄人物，创造着亘古未有的奇迹！是他们，以史无前例的速度，把武钢高炉和平炉的竣工日期，提前再提前；是他们，把过去加在武汉头上的那些不产铁、不产钢、不产水泥、不产化工原料、不能制造重要机器设备的一系列“不”字，统统勾销；是他们，以飞快的速度，把今年的工业生产计划，提前五十三天完成。
    这是具有光荣的革命传统的武汉工人，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，献于祖国的丰硕果实，是他们的智慧和力量的结晶。在跃进的洪流中，著名的工人马学礼等八大旗手出现了，他们飞快地登上了跃进的高峰，更多的人也涌上来了，他们都是各个战线上的英雄好汉，是总路线的忠实执行者，是遍地怒放的朵朵红花。
    在这些许许多多英雄中间，江岸车辆厂货车车间工长吴良湖，是一个闪耀着共产主义光芒的先进工人。他不仅十年来没有出过废品，月月超额完成计划，更为可贵的是，为了集体的事业，无私的帮助别人共同前进。他一丝不苟地担负着中梁划线的工作，可是当他发现下一道工序——钻眼工序质量不好的时候，便赶紧走过去，和工人们一起研究，帮助他们做出了一种套模，钻眼的质量提高了。从这件事里，他明白了：“光靠一个人工作得好，是制造不出优质的车辆来的。”“帮助别人，提高自己，让祖国社会主义大花园里百花争开，春天永在。”这以后他更加关心别人的生产情况，只要发现那里有困难，即使与自己无关的工序，也主动帮助。他先后三次到其他工组帮助工作，终于使这些工组成为先进小组。
    吴良湖在武汉已经成为一面鲜明的旗帜，各个工厂工人以他为学习的榜样，像雨后春笋一般，又出现了无数个吴良湖。光吴良湖所在的工厂——江岸车辆厂，就已经有一百多个。正是他们，把别人的困难，当成自己的困难，把帮助别人看成是自己的责任，于是，一个带动十个，十个又带动百个，终于把全市工人带动起来，为今年继续跃进创建了功勋。他们懂得：“一滴水兴不起波浪，一块砖建不成楼房，社会主义的巨厦，需要大家才能建成。”这种思想所产生的巨大力量，给看不见群众力量的人是一个多么有力的回击。
    请看看十八岁的王多英吧！一双能干的手，织起手套来，上针快，过针快，收口也快，在星火针织内衣厂里数她是一把快手。但她并不满意这种状况，她要帮助别人赶上自己。她去帮助易橄清，提出同她开展竞赛，这一下可把小易怔住了，“竞赛？我的产量那么低，能赛过你？”小王说：“你想得不对，竞赛，是为了共同提高生产水平，不是为了别的。”至此以后，她经常同她的竞赛对手在一起，告诉她如何做好生产准备，如何过针，如何检查机件，毫无保留地把自己一切经验传授给她，小易的产量很快提高了，全组的产量也立即提高一倍，第三季度被评上全武昌区的先进小组。
    王多英并没有满足。她看到自己这一组先进了，另一组却落在后面，这怎么能行呢？！轮到她下班休息了，她又溜进车间里，帮助别组干活。她眼快心细，立刻又看中了两名劳动纪律差、产量低的“对象”，经过从思想上和技术上耐心帮助以后，这两名工人产量都提高了一倍，而且都成为工厂的先进生产者。这个组的生产水平也有了很大提高。大家都感激她，表扬多英姑娘有一颗“组内组外一样的心”。
    这件事看起来多么平凡，但是在这平凡的举动里，包含着多么深刻的意义。他们没有任何私心，而是以建设社会主义和共产主义的崇高目的，作为自己行动的标尺。正因为如此，他们时刻关心着别人的困难，带动着千千万万的人，勇往直前。也正因为如此，他们总是在困难面前挺身而出，踏着困难前进。且不说武汉工人都熟悉的重型机床厂调整工马学礼，他从今年1月到9月，提出了合理化建议三百多件，任何困难，从来没有把他难住，就是周树，这位六十岁的老工人，困难又何尝把他难倒过。他是武汉铁路局武昌机务段机床工长。今年，铁路运输量飞速上涨，机务段检修机车的任务大大地增加了，因此，担负检修机车配件加工任务的机械组也就更加紧张。加工配件，缺乏设备，特别是那些又长又大的配件，更没有大型机器加工。有人提出向上级要，周树说：“有困难，想办法，向上级要机器，这不符合大跃进的风格。”结果这位“老英雄”十几天制成了一部龙门刨床，克服了加工大配件的困难。
    像这样的人物，在今天的伟大时代里，有着千千万万。他们站立在党的总路线的光辉旗帜下，创造了万紫千红的今天，但是，他们并没有满足，正在继续鼓足干劲，创造着更加光辉灿烂的明天。“跃进还需再跃进，明春更上一重天，六亿人民齐动手，超英何劳用十年。”这是重型机床厂一位机修工人写的豪迈诗篇，这也是武汉三十万职工的心声。英雄的武汉人民，正以更大的步伐向更大的胜利前进！
