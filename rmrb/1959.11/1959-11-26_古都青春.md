    Ancient Capital's Youthful Vigor
    Qin Hanming
    On December 12, 1936, a heart-stirring event occurred in the old Northwest of China – the “Xi'an Incident.” Chiang Kai-shek was captured by Generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng, who advocated resistance against Japan, at Huaqing Pool in Mount Li, fifty miles east of Xi'an. This was a victory for the Chinese Communist Party's policy of a "united front against Japanese aggression by stopping the civil war." The banner of resistance against Japan was raised high from Yan'an, and many young people, from various remote places, passed through Xi'an to go to Yan'an.
    Xi'an, this ancient city, where our Chinese ancestors began to work diligently thousands of years ago, has served as the capital for eleven dynasties. The poet Du Fu wrote the line "Qinzhong has been the land of emperors since ancient times." It is located in the middle of the eight hundred-mile Qinchuan Plain. To its south are the Qinling and Bashan Mountains, rich in timber, medicinal materials, and minerals, resembling a screen when viewed from afar; to the north is the famous Weibei coalfield, known as the "black belt"; Xi'an is surrounded by eight rivers, with boundless fertile land, where cotton bolls are abundant and wheat waves roll in spring and summer…
    On the east bank of the Chan River, where the shade is lush, the water is as smooth as a mirror, and the scenery is pleasant, lies the site of a Neolithic primitive society village – Banpo Village. Today, a primitive commune museum has been built here. People can see the living conditions of our ancestors four or five thousand years ago. The museum also displays pottery and stone spindle whorls, as well as exquisite fishhooks and small bone needles. Are these not the epitome of their use of these tools to conquer nature and create a better life?
    Xi'an, with its long history, is not only one of the birthplaces of the Chinese nation, but also a cradle of culture and a home of poetry. Great poets such as Li Bai, Du Fu, Bai Juyi, and Wang Wei have all left behind many brilliant and moving poems here. Their poems have been passed down among the people for thousands of years, illuminating the Chinese poetry scene and enriching the world's literary treasury.
    However, Xi'an, once praised by poets in magnificent poems, has endured vicissitudes, rises and falls, frequent wars, and heavy disasters like terrible hurricanes in the long river of history, tormenting it into a dilapidated city, generation after generation. Especially during the Kuomintang rule, it became a military base for the Chiang-Hu bandit gang to blockade and attack the revolutionary holy land – Yan'an. At that time, Xi'an was full of bunkers and trenches, the reactionaries were sowing the seeds of war, and the bandits were creating death.
    As the earth returns to spring, Xi'an entered a new era in 1949. Over the past decade, this ancient city has radiated youthful brilliance. Like a vigorous steed, it has brushed away the dust from the historical curtain, healed its wounds, and painted a newest and most beautiful picture in the ranks of socialist construction, gradually transforming from a dilapidated consumer city into a new type of industrial and cultural city.
    Today's Xi'an is charming and graceful, with towering buildings, orderly streets, rows of green trees, and a prosperous market. The Bell Tower, standing majestically in the city center, has a golden roof, green tiles, carved beams, painted pillars, and magnificent flying eaves. The old road conditions of "Chang'an Avenue connected to slopes" and "a stove of incense on sunny days, a pot of paste on rainy days" have been changed. The newly built asphalt, cement, and gravel roads extend from the Bell Tower in all directions, forming a "chessboard" road network in the 75-square-kilometer city and suburbs. The endless stream of buses, trolleybuses, huge dump trucks, and heavy-duty trucks, fully loaded with passengers, materials, machinery, and equipment, are running day and night. New underground pipelines have been built, and the sewage from thousands of households is continuously collected into the newly built sewage treatment plant through unobstructed sewers. At night, standing on the magnificent nine-story People's Building and looking out, tens of thousands of lights shine brightly on the land within a radius of dozens of miles, dressing up this city that never sleeps like a beautiful crystal palace; the roaring and screaming of trains rise and fall; the horns of vehicles shuttle back and forth; the torrent of people on the streets is noisy and boiling... Here, one can hear the sound of the ancient city rushing forward like a giant dragon.
    Changing with each passing day and becoming more and more fascinating, Xi'an has attracted countless tourists. The "old Xi'an" returning to the old place all use "unprecedented changes" to praise Xi'an's great changes; foreign friends who help our country with construction have compared Xi'an's construction to "fairy-tale speed." Yes, the endless stream of miracles in Xi'an is even more beautiful than fairy tales. Today, the urban area has broken through the old circle of the original 13 square kilometers and expanded to 75 square kilometers. The emerging building complexes are like a vast ocean, expanding into the distance. Look, there are newly built factories, schools, hospitals, and residences everywhere, and new construction is underway everywhere. In the past decade, the newly built construction area has reached as much as nine million square meters, which is equivalent to two and a half times the original housing area of ​​old Xi'an. The years of "it is not easy to live in Chang'an" are over. The state has invested more than 225 million yuan to build new residences that can accommodate 730,000 people.
    The Party's children write the best sentences in the poorest and whitest places, and paint the most magnificent pictures on the ancient city where the market was deserted, the city walls were decadent, and the industry was declining yesterday. Today, Xi'an has become an important base for my country and the Northwest's machinery industry, electrical instrument industry, and textile industry. Hundreds of thousands of workers from all over the country are fighting day and night next to hundreds of newly built and expanded large and medium-sized factory machines. They are working hard for the development of production and the improvement of people's lives, producing colorful products.
    "Having no iron" has become a laughing stock for people to satirize the backwardness of old Xi'an. Last year, in addition to the mass steelmaking where "steel flowers splashed in thousands of households, and the streets and alleys were red," after 57 days of hard work by the workers, the first steel plant in the Northwest – Xi'an Steel Plant – has been put into production. Xi'an has built new modern medium-temperature medium-pressure and high-temperature high-pressure power plants, with a power generation capacity more than twelve times that before liberation. Powerful currents, like abundant blood, pass through the spiderweb-like high-voltage transmission lines, with Xi'an as the center, supplying electricity to factories, mines, and agriculture as far east as Weinan, west to Baoji, south to Hu County, and north to Tongchuan.
    Xi'an is like an eagle flapping its wings and flying high. The Textile City in the eastern suburbs and the Electrical Engineering City in the western suburbs are like the two wings of the eagle, wearing the morning glow, riding the morning breeze, and spreading their wings and flying thousands of miles a day.
    The Bailuyuan on the east bank of the Chan River was once a famous battlefield in history. In those days, after Emperor Gaozu of Han broke through Wu Pass and Yao Pass, he stationed his troops here, took Xianyang City to the west, and made a "three-chapter agreement" with the elders of Guanzhong. Today's Bailuyuan has the same mountains and rivers, but a brand-new look. It has become a "textile city". Rows of gray-white sawtooth-shaped factory buildings and tall buildings with green bricks and red tiles are lined up one after another, stretching for five miles. Seven years ago, it was still an undulating farmland and a few scattered small villages. Today, it has become a completely new, modern textile printing and dyeing joint enterprise composed of five large factories.
    In 1934, some officials and wealthy merchants in Xi'an, under the guise of shouting "developing the Great Northwest and building the Great Northwest," raised shares to set up the Yuqin Yarn Factory. They spent a lot of effort to buy more than 12,000 spindles, 200 looms, and boilers from "foreign firms" in the United Kingdom, Japan, and France. The machines were transferred from Hong Kong to Yangon, and then from Yangon to Luzhou, Sichuan. After one or twenty years, this Yuqin Yarn Factory, which had once built a chimney, has remained in the "preparation" stage. Therefore, until liberation, Xi'an only had a private Dahua Yarn Factory moved from Hankou and Shijiazhuang. This factory, which was then known as the largest in Xi'an, had only 30,000 spindles and 800 looms. No wonder the people in the Northwest generally lacked clothing and bedding, and most people lived a hard life of "one mattress and one cover, two hemp bags, one cotton and one sheet, and two torn shirts." In contrast to the past, the situation of the socialist construction undertaking changing rapidly every day makes people feel even more proud.
    As soon as you exit Yuxiangmen, there are shady green trees on both sides and in the middle of a 100-meter-wide cement road. On the land on both sides of the road, buildings stand tall and factory buildings are connected, which are several new factories and research institutes. These factories produced the first batch of generators, boilers, and other electrical equipment produced in Northwest China.
    Xi'an, the industrial landscape is full of exotic flowers and plants, and the cultural garden is also full of fragrant flowers. Today, climbing the Big Wild Goose Pagoda, which "stands high in the sky," and looking around, within a radius of 20 square kilometers, green trees and red buildings are connected together. Twenty-two new universities and colleges have formed an educational network for training various specialized talents for socialist construction. Witnessing this magnificent and splendid cultural cradle and scientific building is precisely the realization of Du Fu's dream of "obtaining tens of millions of mansions to shelter all the poor scholars in the world." Standing on the ancient Big Wild Goose Pagoda, what is displayed before us is a socialist beauty, and what is displayed before us is the unparalleled magnificent youth of the ancient city of Xi'an.

    古都青春
    秦汉明
    1936年12月12日，在旧中国的大西北，出了一件震动人心的大事——“西安事变”。蒋介石在西安东五十里的骊山华清池，被主张抗日的张学良、杨虎城将军抓住了。这是中国共产党“停止内战、一致抗日”的抗日民族统一战线政策的胜利。抗日大旗从延安高高举起，多少青年，从各个遥远的地方，路过西安奔投延安。
    西安，这个古老的城市，几千年前，我们中华民族的祖先就开始在这一块地方辛勤经营，十一个朝代曾把这里作为他们的都城，诗人杜甫就有“秦中自古帝王州”的诗句。它位于八百里秦川的中间。在它的南边，有盛产木材、药材和矿藏丰富的秦岭、巴山，遥遥眺望犹如屏风；北有著名的渭北煤田，号称“黑腰带”；西安四周，八水环绕，沃野无际，春夏季节，棉桃累累，麦浪滚滚……。
    在浓荫翠绿，波光如镜，景色宜人的滻河东岸，有新石器时代原始社会村庄的遗址——半坡村。今天，这里已建成一座原始公社博物馆。人们从这里可以看到四、五千年前我们祖先的生活情景。博物馆里，还陈列着陶制和石制的纺线锤，也有精巧的鱼钩和小骨针，那不正是他们用这些工具征服自然，创造美好生活的缩影？
    历史悠久的西安，既是我国民族发祥地之一，又是文化的摇篮、诗的家乡。伟大诗人李白、杜甫、白居易、王维都曾在这里留下了不少光辉动人的诗篇。他们的诗篇，几千年流传在人民中间，光耀了中国的诗坛，丰富了世界文学的宝库。
    但是，曾经被诗人以瑰丽诗篇歌颂过的西安，在几千年来的历史长河中，饱阅沧桑，屡经兴废，频繁的战乱，重重的灾难，像可怕的飓风一样，一代一代，把它折磨成一座残破不堪的城市，特别是到了国民党统治时期，这里成为蒋胡匪帮封锁和进攻革命圣地——延安的军事基地。那时，西安是处处碉堡，遍地战壕，反动派在播着战争的火种，匪徒们在制造死亡。
    大地回春，1949年西安跨进了新时代。十年来，这座古城焕发出青春的光彩，它像一匹矫健的骏马，在社会主义建设的行列里，从历史幕布上拂去灰尘，补好创伤，绘上一幅最新最美丽的图画，由一个破烂的消费城市，逐渐变成了新型的工业和文化城市。
    今日西安，妩媚多姿，楼房高耸，街道井然，绿树成行，市面繁荣。雄立在市中心的钟楼，金顶绿瓦，雕梁画栋，飞檐壮丽。旧日“长安大道连斜坡”，“晴天一炉香，雨天一锅浆”的道路状况已经改观。新修的柏油、水泥和碎石路，从钟楼伸展到四面八方，在七十五平方公里的城里和郊区，已形成了“棋盘式”的道路网。川流不息的公共汽车、电车，庞大的自卸汽车和载重卡车，满载着客人、材料、机械和设备，夜以继日的奔驰着。新的地下管道已经建起，千家万户的污水，通过畅通无阻的下水管道，源源汇集到新建的污水处理厂里。入夜，站在高达九层的雄伟的人民大厦上眺望，方圆几十里的大地上，灯光万朵，相映成辉，把这个不夜之城，打扮得好似美丽的水晶宫；那轰鸣尖叫的火车声，此起彼伏；车辆穿梭的喇叭声，街道上人的洪流，喧嚣沸腾……这里，听到了古城像巨龙汹涌飞奔的声音。
    日新月异，越来越富有迷人魔力的西安，不知招来了多少游客。旧地重游的“老西安”，都用“今非昔比”来赞美西安的巨变；帮助我国建设的外国友人，曾把西安的建设比做“童话般的速度”。是的，西安层出不穷的奇迹，比童话还美丽。今日城区已突破原十三平方公里的旧圈圈，扩展到七十五平方公里，新兴的建筑群，像是浩瀚的海洋，正向远方扩展。瞧，到处都是新建的工厂、学校、医院和住宅，到处又在进行着新的建设。十年来，新修的建筑面积多达九百万平方米，相当于旧西安原有房屋面积的两倍半。“长安居大不易”的年头已成过去，国家拿出两亿两千五百多万元，兴建了可以容纳七十三万人的新住宅。
    党的儿女，把最好的诗句写在最穷最白的地方，把最壮丽的图画，画在昨天市面萧条、城垣颓废、工业雕零的古城上。今日西安，已经成为我国和西北的机械工业、电器仪表工业和纺织工业的重要基地了。几十万来自各地的职工，日日夜夜战斗在数以百计的新建和扩建的大、中型的工厂机器旁边。为发展生产，改善人民生活而挥汗如流的劳动着，生产出万紫千红的产品。
    “手无寸铁”已成人们讽刺旧西安落后的笑谈。去年，除了“千家万户钢花溅，街头巷尾一片红”的群众炼钢外，经过职工五十七天的苦战，西北第一座钢厂——西安钢厂，已投入生产。西安新建现代化的中温中压和高温高压的发电厂，发电容量是解放前的十二倍以上。强大的电流，像一股充沛的血液，通过蛛网般的高压输电线路，以西安为中心，供应东到渭南，西到宝鸡，南达鄠县，北及铜川的工厂、矿山和农业的用电。
    西安像雄鹰在振翅飞翔，东郊的纺织城，西郊的电工城，好似雄鹰的两只翅膀，披朝霞，驾晨风，一日千里地展翅高飞。
    位于滻河东岸的白鹿塬，曾是历史上有名的战地。当年，汉高祖攻破武关嶢关后，大兵驻扎此地，西取咸阳城，曾与关中父老“约法三章”。今日的白鹿塬，山水如故，面貌一新，这里已成了一座“纺织城”。一排排灰白色的锯齿形厂房，一幢幢青砖红瓦的高大楼房，鳞次栉比，连绵五里。七年前，它还是一片起伏不平的庄稼地和几个零散的小村庄。今天，已由五座大型工厂组成一个完全新型的、现代化的纺织印染联合企业。
    1934年，西安的一些官僚和巨商们，在大喊大叫“开发大西北，建设大西北”的幌子下，曾集股筹设裕秦纱厂。他们费了九牛二虎之力，从英国、日本和法国的“洋行”里，买下了一万二千多枚纱锭、二百台布机和锅炉，机器从香港转仰光，又从仰光运到四川泸州，经过一、二十年的时间，这个曾经建起烟囱的裕秦纱厂，却一直停留在“筹备”中。所以，直到解放时，西安只有一座由汉口、石家庄搬来的私营大华纱厂。这个当时被称为西安最大的工厂，仅有三万枚纱锭和八百台布机。难怪，西北人民普遍缺穿少盖，多数人过着“一铺一盖，两条麻袋，一棉一单，两件破衫”的苦难生活。新旧对比，社会主义建设事业一日千里的情景，就更加使人感到自豪。
    一出玉祥门，一条一百米宽的水泥马路的两边和中间，绿树成荫。马路两侧的土地上，楼厦林立，厂房相连，这里是几个新型的工厂和研究所。这些工厂生产了西北地区第一批出产的发电机、锅炉和其它电气设备。
    西安，工业风景线上是奇花异苑，文化园地也是群芳争艳。今天，登临“孤高耸天宫”的大雁塔上瞩目四望，方圆二十平方公里内，绿树红楼连成一片。二十二所新型的大专院校，已构成一个培养社会主义建设各类专门人材的教育网。目睹这片壮阔灿烂的文化摇篮和科学大厦，正是杜甫“安得广厦千万间，大庇天下寒士俱欢颜”的梦想的实现。站在古老的大雁塔上，展现在我们眼前的是一片社会主义的美景，展现在我们眼前的是古都西安的无比瑰丽的青春。
