Building a Cement Plant from Scratch
Shen Hao, Secretary of the General Party Branch of Jinshan Cement Plant, Jinshan County, Shanghai

The Jinshan Cement Plant was originally an iron plant during the mass campaign of indigenous iron smelting in 1958. It was converted to cement production at the beginning of this year. All the workers in the plant came from the People's Commune. There were no engineers, technicians, or experienced workers in the plant. When the plant was first established, besides some dilapidated sheds, three 20-horsepower diesel engines, and a rice milling head left over from iron smelting, there was no other equipment. All the cadres and workers of the plant started from scratch, building while constructing, experimenting, and producing. They successively broke through the three major barriers of technology, equipment, and cost, achieving remarkable results. The quality of cement reached the elimination of grade 300 in the third quarter and generally stabilized at grade 400; the output increased month by month, and the plan was overfulfilled every month. The plan for the third quarter was completed 23 days ahead of schedule. At the same time, a large number of cement products of various specifications were produced, such as cement pipes, manhole covers, sidewalk slabs, kerbstones, washbasins, sinks, bathtubs, and 16 other types of cement products. These products not only supplied the needs of the entire county but also supported the needs of Shanghai's urban areas.

Relying on Indigenous Methods to Improve Quality Actively

At the beginning of this year, our county's industrial and agricultural construction required a lot of cement. In order to solve the contradiction between cement supply and demand through self-reliance, the county party committee decided to let us produce cement. How could we produce cement? None of the leading cadres or workers understood. With a strong revolutionary will, the entire plant's staff, based on the principle of "combining foreign and indigenous methods," painstakingly researched and actively tried to produce cement.

At the beginning, slaked lime was used as the main raw material. Some reference materials were found, and the proportions of indigenous cement production in other regions were studied. Small stone mortars and mills were used for crushing, and the small blast furnaces and earthen furnaces used for iron smelting were used for calcination. However, contrary to expectations, continuous trials for nearly a month failed.

We summarized the lessons learned from the failures and analyzed the reasons for the failures. On the one hand, we sent people out to "learn from experience" and learn about testing experiences from other places; on the other hand, we reinvigorated our efforts and mobilized all the plant's staff to study hard and diligently, transforming the small blast furnaces for iron smelting into small vertical kilns of different specifications for various forms of experimentation. At the same time, in response to the pessimistic and discouraged mood of a few employees at that time, we launched extensive discussions and debates on "whether or not we can overcome difficulties" and "whether indigenous cement production exceeds objective permissible conditions." In the course of discussions and debates, the workers deeply realized from the practice of 1958 that there can be no Great Leap Forward without difficulties, and the greater the difficulties overcome, the greater the achievements. At the same time, they affirmed that it is scientifically based, not wishful thinking, to make high-quality silicate cement from limestone and clay. On this basis, the entire plant's staff was organized to learn by doing, teach each other, and study in depth the basic principles and technological requirements of cement production. After more than 20 failures, we finally produced grade 300 silicate cement with good stability at the end of February. The plant's general party branch immediately focused on improving product quality. In May, grade 400 cement was produced. In the third quarter, grade 300 was basically eliminated, and all reached grade 400. In September, even higher quality grade 500 cement was produced. The cement needed for the county's farmland electrical and mechanical irrigation projects this spring was guaranteed in a timely manner. Some of the cement was also sold to construction units in Shanghai's urban areas. According to tests by the Shanghai Road, Bridge, Water Supply and Drainage Research Institute and appraisals by capital construction units, the grade 400 cement produced by our plant fully meets the standards of grade 400 cement produced by modern equipment.

Manufacturing Mechanical Equipment to Produce Cement Products

During the cement trial production stage, our plant attached great importance to technical innovation and extensively mobilized the masses to carry out technical innovation campaigns. Technical innovation organizations were established from top to bottom, gradually realizing more than 30 technical innovation projects from scratch, from rough to fine. Using some waste materials from the past indigenous iron smelting, we created a dust collector with a daily output of five to eight tons and a vibrating screen with a daily output of two tons of raw materials. We created four pulverizers, one crusher, two dry and wet mixers, and used stone to make three motorized stone rollers, etc. Through inter-factory cooperation, we added two small ball mills and four hammer crushers. The several rice milling heads and stone mortars used at the beginning of production have become historical relics. Now, the mechanization of crushing and mixing, and the semi-mechanization of calcination have been basically realized, and labor productivity has increased several times. Labor productivity in September increased by 9.3 times compared to March. At the same time, more than 20 factory buildings and four vertical kilns were built with the earthen furnace covers left over from iron smelting, and a simple laboratory was established to ensure normal production. From January to September, the total output value of the plant was 269,800 yuan.

After the technical barrier was broken and a batch of equipment was manufactured, the next step was to solve the problem of reducing costs. By the end of May, our plant's cement production had lost 60,000 yuan, which was incompatible with the socialist enterprise's mission of accumulating construction funds. Under the leadership and support of the superior party committee, we made a great determination to break through the loss barrier. We strengthened enterprise management from top to bottom and saved expenses as much as possible. Under the slogan of "Love the factory as your home," the workers took great care of production tools and raw materials. During machine maintenance, many workers voluntarily went out to do temporary work, engaging in loading and unloading, to reduce cost expenditures. At the same time, they tried every means to carry out technical innovation and improve labor productivity.

In order to quickly and fundamentally solve the problem of losses and better support industrial and agricultural production, the plant's general party branch decided to vigorously develop cement product production. The way was found, but these products were produced by other units under the guidance of engineers and technicians. All the staff of our plant were complete laymen in concrete. How could we get involved? The experience gained in practice is that as long as the direction is correct and there is the will and ambition of "human effort can overcome nature," conditions can be created. We sent people out to visit, learn from experts in foreign factories, seek advice, find materials to study, and borrow models to imitate and experiment in production. After nearly a month of efforts, we finally broke through this new topic. Starting in June, we accepted orders for more than a dozen types of cement products from Shanghai's commercial departments and industrial capital construction units. Cement product production was officially put into production, and a large number of various specifications of cement pipes needed for rural irrigation were supplied. By the end of September, the output value of various cement products produced reached more than 98,000 yuan, strongly supporting the basic construction of urban industry and farmland water conservancy. Our financial situation has improved significantly. In June, we basically maintained self-sufficiency, and from July, we turned from loss to profit. In the third quarter, cement production (including products) contributed a total of 32,800 yuan in profits, and costs were much lower than in the second quarter. Now, the variety of cement products is still expanding.

Putting Politics in Command Everywhere, Production is Flourishing

The reason why Jinshan Cement Plant was able to start from scratch and produce a large amount of cement and cement products is mainly due to the fact that the factory leadership adhered to putting politics in command and vigorously promoted mass movements.

Through quarterly, monthly, and sectional summaries of work, inspection of production, the factory leadership promptly grasped and analyzed the ideological dynamics of cadres and the masses, earnestly conducted situational education and production briefings for employees, and often used the method of extensive discussions and debates to organize the masses to debate the situation, the significance of tasks, check on fearful emotions, check on leadership methods, find key points, find solutions, formulate measures, and formulate guarantees. At the same time, they grasped both ends to lead the middle, and used typical examples of advanced people, advanced deeds, and advanced ideas to educate employees. Therefore, the vast majority of employees in the plant were full of vigor and enthusiasm. From the factory level to the production team, the core leading role of the Party was fully exerted. In addition to attending meetings and handling administrative business, leading cadres were always in production with the workers; workshop leaders consistently followed the shift production, and they all labored in the most difficult production positions. The relationship between leaders and the masses was very close.

Starting from the first quarter, red flag competitions were widely carried out between workshops, between groups, and between people. The leadership effectively grasped the link of evaluation. Individuals and groups were evaluated every five days, workshops were evaluated every ten days, a small evaluation was conducted every month, and a large evaluation was conducted every quarter, constantly organizing production climaxes. The factory also timely used black bulletin boards, big-character posters, loudspeakers, and organized celebratory news and congratulatory news to encourage advanced elements and promote mutual progress. Therefore, the red flag competition movement was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the enthusiasm of employees for production was in full swing, and advanced deeds continued to emerge. For example, in hammering stones (the crushing capacity was insufficient), each person only hammered 300 catties per day last year during iron smelting. This year, starting from 1,000 catties, it increased month by month, and now each person hammers 3,000 to 4,000 catties per day, with a maximum of more than 5,100 catties per day. From January to September, 144 red and expert activists and production activists emerged in the entire plant, accounting for 40% of the total number of employees.

    白手起家造水泥
    中共上海市金山县金山水泥厂总支书记　沈浩
    金山水泥厂的前身是1958年大搞土法炼铁时的一个铁厂，今年年初转为生产水泥。全厂工人都来自人民公社，厂里没有工程师、技术人员，也没有老工人。初建厂时，除了炼铁时留下的一些破旧草棚、三部二十马力柴油机和轧米的车头以外，没有什么别的设备。全厂干部和工人就这样赤手空拳，白手起家，在短短几个月当中，边建设、边试验、边生产，连续突破了技术、设备、成本三大关，取得了显著的成绩。水泥质量，第三季度达到了消灭三百号，一般稳定在四百号；产量月月上升，计划月月超额完成，第三季度提前二十三天完成了计划。同时大量生产了多种规格的水泥管、阴井盖、人行道石板、侧石、水盆、面盆、浴缸等十六种水泥制品。这些产品不仅供应了全县的需要，还支援了上海市区的需要。
    依靠土法上马　积极提高质量
    今年年初，我县工农业建设需要很多水泥。为了自力更生解决水泥供求之间的矛盾，县委决定让我们生产水泥。怎样能生产出水泥来呢？从领导干部到工人没有一个懂得。全厂职工凭着坚强的革命意志，根据“洋土结合”的方针，刻苦钻研，积极试制。
    开头是以消石灰为主要原料，找了一些参考资料，学习了其他地区土法生产水泥的配比，用小石臼，小磨子粉碎，用原来炼铁的小高炉、土方炉煅烧。然而事与愿违，连续试制了将近一个月，都失败了。
    我们总结了失败的教训，分析了失败的原因，一方面派人出门“取经”，到外地学习化验经验；一方面重振旗鼓，发动全厂职工苦钻苦学，用炼铁小高炉改建成不同规格的小立窑，作多种形式的试验。同时，根据少数职工当时的畏难泄气情绪，开展了“能不能战胜困难”、“土法生产水泥是否超越客观许可条件”等大鸣大放大争大辩。在鸣放辩论中，工人们根据1958年的实践深刻地体会到，搞大跃进就不能没有困难，战胜困难以后取得的成绩也就越大，同时肯定了以石灰石加粘土能够制成质量很好的矽酸盐水泥，这是有科学根据的，不是胡思乱想。在这个基础上，组织全厂职工边做边学，互教互学，深入细致地学习水泥生产的基本原理和工艺要求。又经过二十多次失败，终于在2月底制成了安定性良好的三百号矽酸盐水泥。厂党总支紧接着大抓提高产品质量。5月份生产出四百号水泥，三季度基本上消灭了三百号，全部达到四百号，9月份又生产出质量更高的五百号水泥。今春全县农田机电灌溉工程需要的水泥，及时保证了供应。一部分水泥还销到上海市区的建设单位。经上海道路桥梁给排水研究所化验和基本建设单位鉴定，我厂生产的四百号水泥，完全符合现代化设备生产的四百号水泥的标准。
    自造机械设备　生产水泥制品
    在试制水泥阶段，我们厂就十分重视技术革新，广泛地发动群众开展技术革新运动。自上而下成立了技术革新组织，从无到有，由粗到细，逐步地实现了三十多项技术革新项目，利用过去土法炼铁时的一些废旧材料，创造了日产五至八吨的吸尘器和日产生料二吨的震动筛，创造了四台粉碎机，一台破碎机，二台干、湿搅拌机，用石料制成了三台机动石碾子等，通过厂际协作增添了二台小型球磨机、四台鎯头粉碎机。年初开始生产时使用的几只轧米车头和石臼，已成了历史陈迹，现在基本上实现了粉碎搅拌机械化，煅烧半机械化，劳动生产率成倍提高。9月份的劳动生产率比3月份提高了九点三倍。与此同时，利用炼铁时剩下的土炉盖了二十多间厂房，四座立窑，建立了简易化验室，保证了正常生产。1至9月份，全厂产值完成了二十六万九千八百元。
    技术关突破了，设备造出了一批，接下来要解决降低成本的问题。到5月底止，我们厂的水泥生产亏损了六万元，这是同社会主义企业积累建设资金的使命不相容的。在上级党的领导和支持下，我们立下大志，决心突破亏损关。我们由上而下加强了企业管理，尽一切可能节约费用。在“爱厂如家”的口号下，工人们对生产工具、原材料十分爱护；机器维修期间，许多工人自动出去做临时工，搞搬运装卸，以减少成本开支；同时，千方百计大搞技术革新，提高劳动生产率。
    厂党总支为了迅速从根本上解决亏损问题，同时更好地支援工农业生产，决定大搞水泥制品生产。门路找到了，然而这些产品，别的单位都是在工程师、技术人员指导下生产的。我们全厂职工对混凝土是地道的门外汉，怎么跨进去？实践中得出的经验是：只要方向对头，有“事在人为，人定胜天”的意志和雄心，条件是可以创造的。我们于是派人外出参观，向外厂内行拜师求教，找资料学习，借模型自己仿造，在生产中摸索试验。经过近一个月的努力，终于突破了这一新的课题。6月份起，我们接受了上海商业部门和工业基本建设单位十多种水泥制品的订货任务，水泥制品正式投入了生产，并且供应了农村灌溉方面需要的大批各种规格的水泥管子。到9月底，生产出的各种水泥制品，产值达九万八千多元，大力支援了城市工业和农田水利的基本建设。我们的财务状况有了显著的起色，6月份基本上保持了自给，从7月份开始变亏损为盈余，第三季度水泥生产（包括制品）共上缴利润三万二千八百元，成本比第二季度下降了很多。现在，水泥制品的品种还在不断扩大。
    处处政治挂帅　生产欣欣向荣
    金山水泥厂所以能白手起家，生产出大量水泥和水泥制品，主要是工厂领导方面坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动的结果。
    工厂领导方面通过按季按月按段总结工作检查生产，及时地掌握和分析干部群众的思想动态，切实向职工进行形势教育和生产交底，并且经常运用大鸣大放大辩论的方法，组织群众辩形势，辩任务意义，查畏难情绪，查领导方法，找关键，找办法，订措施，订保证，同时抓两头带中间，用先进人物先进事迹先进思想的典型事例教育职工，因此全厂绝大部分职工朝气勃勃，劲头十足。从厂一级到生产组，充分发挥了党的核心领导作用。领导干部除开会和处理行政业务工作外，一直同工人在一起生产；车间领导人员一贯跟班生产，而且都是在最艰苦的生产岗位上劳动，领导和群众的关系十分亲密。
    从第一季度开始，车间与车间、组与组、人与人之间广泛开展了红旗竞赛，领导方面切实抓住评比这一环节，个人、小组五天评，车间按旬评，每月一小评，一季大评比，不断地组织生产高潮。厂里还及时运用黑报板、大字报、扩音机和组织报喜、贺喜等宣传鼓动形式，鼓励先进，互相促进，因此红旗竞赛运动深入人心，职工生产劲头热火朝天，先进事迹不断涌现。如敲石头（破碎机能力不足），去年炼铁时每人每天只敲三百斤，今年从一千斤开始月月提高，现在每人每天敲三千斤到四千斤，最多每人每天敲五千一百多斤。1至9月份，全厂涌现出来的红专积极分子和生产积极分子有一百四十四名，占职工总人数的40％。
