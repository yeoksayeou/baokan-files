Xinhua News Agency, 12th: A new stage has begun in the nationwide high tide of grain procurement and storage. Grain procurement work has progressed rapidly in recent days. Areas that have successfully completed their procurement tasks are now shifting to focus on catching up with laggards, managing unified sales, and arranging livelihood provisions. Areas that have not yet completed their procurement tasks are redoubling their efforts to accelerate the pace of storage.

As of November 5th, 76.4% of the national grain procurement and storage task for this year had been completed. With the arrival of the autumn grain harvest in the north and the late rice harvest in the south, more and more regions are completing their annual grain procurement tasks. In the twenty days from late October to early November, following Guizhou, eight more provinces and autonomous regions—Sichuan, Henan, Qinghai, Gansu, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Hunan—completed their annual grain procurement tasks.

Areas that have already completed or are close to completing their annual grain procurement tasks are now focusing their grain work on the following aspects:

First, catching up with laggard areas. In provinces and regions where procurement work has progressed rapidly, there are still imbalances in procurement between regions and varieties. Some special districts, counties, and communes have not fully completed their tasks, and some varieties have not been sufficiently purchased. Now, all provinces and regions have strengthened work in these areas to enable laggard areas to catch up. While the task of purchasing staple grains in Hebei Province is nearing completion, they are actively purchasing potatoes. Henan, Shaanxi, Shandong and other provinces require that under the principle of implementing national policies and properly arranging grain for rural use, efforts should be made to comprehensively complete the annual procurement task.

Second, managing unified grain sales and arranging livelihoods. Many regions, while carrying out procurement and storage, have already arranged grain for farmers' rations, seeds, and feed until the next harvest season. They have also arranged grain reserves for communes, production teams, and members, and have deployed unified sales work in grain-deficient areas. The Henan Provincial leading organs instructed all localities to ensure urban grain supply while also doing a good job in rural unified sales, and to fully arrange grain supplies for grain-deficient areas until the next harvest. Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong and other provinces have universally held on-site meetings on planned grain use and economical grain use, promoted experiences in planned grain use and processing coarse grains into fine grains, and strengthened the work of commune canteens to ensure that members eat their fill and eat well. Some areas have also helped communes establish and improve grain collection, management, and use systems, and helped communes properly arrange grain use plans for busy and slack seasons.

Third, focusing on business operations such as collection, transportation, and storage, further verifying production, verifying the amount of storage, and inspecting the implementation of policies and the development of various business operations. This year, the speed of grain storage is generally faster than in previous years, and the quality of work is also better than in previous years. However, due to the rapid development of the movement, the business operations in some areas cannot keep up with the needs of the movement's development. According to materials from the Ministry of Grain, some of the procured grain in individual areas is still stored at temporary collection points, people's communes, or production teams, and has not been sent to national warehouses. Currently, these areas are strengthening collection and transportation work, and quickly transporting the grain to national warehouses and along transportation lines. Sichuan, Henan, Guizhou, Hunan and other provinces have already transferred two-thirds of their grain to transportation lines. In order to ensure the safety of stored grain, Guizhou Province has launched a general grain census movement. By mid-October, two-thirds of the province's grain reserves had already been surveyed once.

Areas that have not yet completed their grain procurement tasks have adopted various effective measures to accelerate the pace of storage and improve the quality of procurement work. The three northeastern provinces, which have begun to enter the peak of procurement, are currently concentrating their efforts on reducing the moisture content of grain and carrying out mass short-distance transportation. Yunnan Province has put forward the slogan of "competing with the sky for sunshine and competing with the land for drying fields" to overcome the difficulties of the rainy season, and the amount of storage is constantly increasing.

### 粮食征购日增月长  入库任务已完成百分之七十六  九省区完成全年征购任务

    粮食征购日增月长
    入库任务已完成百分之七十六
    九省区完成全年征购任务
    据新华社12日讯　全国粮食征购、入库高潮已进入新的阶段。连日来粮食征购工作进展很快，已胜利完成征购任务的地区正转入抓后进、抓统销、抓生活安排；尚未完成征购任务的地区正在鼓足干劲，加快入库速度。
    截至11月5日止，全国今年粮食征购入库任务已完成76.4％。随着北方秋粮和南方晚稻收获季节的到来，完成全年粮食征购任务的地区越来越多。在10月下旬到11月上旬二十天中，继贵州之后，又有四川、河南、青海、甘肃、广西、陕西、山西、湖南等八个省、自治区完成了全年粮食征购任务。
    目前已经完成和接近完成全年粮食征购任务的地区，粮食工作正在转向以下几个方面：
    一，抓后进地区。在征购工作进展较快的省、区，还存在地区间和品种间收购不平衡的状况，部分专区、县、公社没有全部完成任务，有些品种还没有收足，现在各省、区已加强这些地区的工作，使后进地区迎头赶上。河北省在收购主粮任务接近完成的同时，正积级收购薯类。河南、陕西、山东等省，要求在贯彻执行国家政策和妥善安排农村用粮的原则下，争取全面完成全年征购任务。
    二、抓粮食统销和安排生活。有不少地区在征购入库的同时，已经把农民的口粮、种子、饲料等安排到了明年接新时节，还安排了公社、生产队和社员的粮食储备，部署了缺粮地区的统销工作。河南省领导机关指示各地在做好城市粮食供应的同时，要把农村统销工作做好，对缺粮地区明年接新以前的粮食供应也要全部安排好。陕西、山西、河南、山东等省普遍召开了计划用粮和节约用粮的现场会议，推广计划用粮、粗粮细作等经验，加强公社食堂工作，使社员吃饱吃好。有些地区还帮助公社建立和健全粮食收、管、用制度，帮助公社妥善安排忙闲季节的用粮计划。
    三、抓集运、保管等业务工作，进一步核实产量，核实入库数量，检查政策执行情况和各种业务工作开展情况。今年粮食入库速度普遍比往年快，工作质量也比往年好，但由于运动发展十分迅速，部分地区业务工作赶不上运动发展的需要。据粮食部的材料，个别地区征购的粮食还有一部分放在临时收购点，人民公社或生产队，没有送入国家仓库。目前，这些地区正在加强集运工作，迅速把粮食运到国家仓库和交通沿线。四川、河南、贵州、湖南等省已有三分之二的粮食调运到交通沿线。贵州省为了确保入库粮食的安全，开展了粮食普查运动。到10月中旬止，全省有三分之二的库存粮已经普查过一次。
    还没有完成粮食征购任务的地区，已采取各种有效措施，加快入库速度和提高收购工作的质量。开始进入征购高潮的东北三省，目前正集中力量，降低粮食水分和开展群众性的短途运输。云南省提出了“向天争太阳，向地争晒场”的口号，克服雨季的困难，入库量不断上升。
