    The Prospect of a Garden City
    By Xiao Guang, our reporter

    Every famous city in Bulgaria has its own distinct characteristics. The historical relics preserved in abundance in Tarnovo and Pleven easily evoke the past of Bulgaria; Plovdiv, stretching between the Maritsa River and picturesque rocky peaks, is particularly prosperous in commerce; Nessebar, with its coastal sand dunes and many Byzantine churches, is known as the "Pearl of the Black Sea"; Varna, known for its beautiful coastal scenery and golden beaches, attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists every year. However, among all these beautiful cities, the one that impresses us the most is Sofia, of which the Bulgarians are proud.

    Sofia, a Garden City

    Sofia enjoys the reputation of a "garden city" not only in Bulgaria but throughout Europe. It is quite accurate to call Sofia a garden city. This city, nestled quietly amidst surrounding mountains, possesses both all the conveniences of modern urban life and the most beautiful natural scenery.

    The charming Vitosha Mountain and Lyulin Mountain form Sofia's magnificent backdrop. These mountain ranges covered with pine and beech forests sometimes appear blue, sometimes turn dark; they do not have a fixed color. Nature constantly adjusts the color of the mountain peaks with the changing weather and the rising and setting of the sun. The urban area of Sofia, however, is draped in another specially made brocade: green lawns and colorful flower beds are everywhere. Visitors to Sofia for the first time invariably enjoy taking this "standard walk": from the Dimitrov Mausoleum along the Russian Boulevard to Eagle Bridge. At least four beautiful gardens are passed along this one-kilometer stretch. Sofia has more than six hundred gardens and lawns. Everyone can find their favorite corner here to relax after a day's fatigue; children have playgrounds specially created for them.

    In fact, even when walking along Sofia's main traffic arteries, one often feels like being in a garden. Here, almost every household has lush flowers and plants planted in front of their doors and under their windows; the clean, white walls are covered with green vines. The main streets are paved with light yellow terracotta bricks, which the capital's cleaners wash clean every night. Along the sides of the streets, tall trees stand in rows like green sentinels. From common poplars, linden trees, chestnut trees, and ash trees to Arabian rubber trees and French plane trees, the city has a total of ninety thousand trees.

  The continuous growth of these plants not only adds poetic beauty to the capital's appearance, providing shade to the city during the hot summer days; more importantly, they form a giant natural filter, constantly removing all substances from the air that are harmful to the health of residents.

    In the street gardens and parks where flowers bloom in competition, there are many elaborately carved bronze statues and monuments. Among them are the great leaders of Bulgaria's past national liberation movements, the most talented revolutionary writers and poets; and the nameless heroes who fell in the struggle for freedom. These lifelike statues and the profound poems and epigrams are of particular educational significance to the younger generation who have never shed blood or undergone the baptism of battle. It is no wonder that Communist Youth League members love to hold rallies here; teachers also often lead children to commemorate the revolutionary predecessors, awaken their memories of Bulgaria's past, and revive the history created by their predecessors before their eyes. The exquisitely decorated fountains are another eye-catching center of Sofia's gardens and squares. Countless silver threads form water columns that shoot into the sky day and night from the horns of angels and from the mouths of happily leaping fish and shrimp; during the day, rainbows appear in the sunlight. Sofia's tap water is smooth and crystal clear, without any sediment, and has a slight sweetness to it when you drink it. Perhaps because it tastes so good, the people of Sofia affectionately call it "longevity water" and have built many small and exquisite drinking fountains throughout the city.

    It Was Not Always Like This

    Foreign guests can't help but admire the fact that the people of Sofia can live, work, and create in such a beautiful environment. Bulgarian friends, however, emphasize that this is all the result of the people's labor under the leadership of the new regime. Sofia was not always a "garden city." During World War II, it was severely bombed by the US and British air forces, destroying more than 12,500 homes, and agencies and enterprises suffered the same disaster. There is hardly a building in the city that does not bear the marks of war. Today's "garden city" has been rebuilt on this foundation. For fifteen years, the Party and the government have guided the people of Sofia through numerous difficulties, not only repairing old houses and building new residential areas, schools, theaters, cinemas, hospitals...; but also expanding the green area of the city's parks and gardens from 2,200 decares before the war to more than 4,000 decares today.

    If you think that the Bulgarian people are completely satisfied with the current state of the capital, you are completely wrong. Here, people have a desire to move forward constantly. Comrade Grozev, Secretary of the Sofia City Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, told us that in order to cooperate with the progress of the national five-year plan, and to solve the current difficult problems caused by the rapid growth of the urban population, such as insufficient and unsuitable housing and urban supply facilities, the Party and the government have decided to continue to rebuild and expand Sofia, so that it further adapts to the needs of the great cause of socialist construction.

    The overall plan for the reconstruction of Sofia was completed on May 1 this year. After listening to Comrade Koichev, Vice Chairman and Chief Engineer of the Sofia City People's Committee, and Comrade Dimitrov, Chief Architect, introduce the main points of this plan, we cannot help but deeply admire how the socialist system has promoted the people's aspirations!

    Changing the Capital's Impact on the National Economy

    The overall plan not only ensures that the residents of Sofia's urban area (900,000) and suburban area (100,000), which will increase to one million by 1975, enjoy all the conditions for labor, rest, and culture, but also solves a series of issues related to industrial development.

    Sofia was originally Bulgaria's main industrial center, with its industrial and handicraft products accounting for more than one-fifth of the country's total industrial output value. However, when the Kremikovtsi Metallurgical Combine near Sofia is completed, the capital's industry will have a greater impact on the national economy. The Kremikovtsi Metallurgical Combine is the largest project during the Third Five-Year Plan. The more than 250 million tons of rich iron ore deposits discovered here are enough to supply a new steel combine ten times larger than the existing Lenin Metallurgical Plant for one hundred years. It can be predicted that the Kremikovtsi Metallurgical Combine will greatly enhance the capital's important position on the industrial front. Sofia will not only have a developed light and processing industry, but also a solid foundation for mining and smelting ferrous metals.

    Sofia's existing industries will also be merged and expanded, and factories harmful to human health will be moved away from the urban area. In the future, the industrial population will still be the main residents of the capital.

    Everything is for the Residents to Work and Rest Well

    The plan determines to reconstruct the housing in the city center, where the population is concentrated and the buildings are not hygienic enough, and in certain residential areas in the suburbs. The average residential area per resident will increase from the current 6.5 square meters to 9 square meters. Public utilities will also be greatly improved. Currently, only half of the city has sewers, and by 1975, sewers will cover the entire city. Each citizen will have an average of 400 liters of domestic water per day and 100 liters of industrial water. The capital's power grid will be converted to 220 volts. After heating, steam and hot water will be able to meet the needs of industry and most of the urban area.

    The plan proposes specific measures for agricultural production in the suburbs, so that suburban agriculture guarantees the supply of fresh food to the capital's residents. It is planned that suburban agriculture will almost entirely meet the capital's needs for vegetables, meet about 88% of the milk needs and 42% of the fruit needs.

    In order to meet the growing cultural life needs of the capital's residents, cultural clubs, cinemas, and theaters will double by 1975. The average school area occupied by each student will increase by 50%. The average kindergarten area occupied by each child will double, and the indicators of health care institutions and commercial networks will also increase by nearly one time. These institutions will be distributed in a planned way throughout the urban and suburban areas, so that they can serve all residents quickly and balancedly.

    The transportation network will be further developed, continuing to complete the radiation network that has already begun construction. There will be good connections between the city's districts and the city center, industrial areas, railway stations, cultural and recreational parks, and stadiums. It will take a maximum of only forty-five minutes from the most remote corner of the city to the city center.

    The green areas that serve as the capital's lungs will be universally established in the city and will be greatly expanded. Parks and other green areas will triple, and street greening work will double. In addition to the current Liberty Park, the West Suburban Park and the South Suburban Park will also be built, so that they can connect the city with Vitosha Mountain, Lyulin Mountain, etc. with perennial forest belts. In short, the average green area per person in the urban area will increase from the current 9 square meters to 56 square meters, and the average green area per person in the suburban area will be 900 square meters.

    A Port Appears in a Mountain City

    You may find it hard to believe: the capital of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, far away from the ocean and shipping waterways, will have its own port—the Port of Sofia! But this is indeed true. The overall plan decided to dig a wide navigable canal to connect Sofia with the Pancharevo artificial lake built a few years ago, and construction has already begun. The Pancharevo-Sofia Canal will be completed in less than two years. This canal, with new-style docks and picturesque bathing beaches along its banks, will surely add to the beauty of the capital. The navigable part of the canal is located between Pancharevo Lake and Pavlov, 17 kilometers long and 31.6 meters to 35.2 meters wide. Sampans and inland river ships carrying 200 passengers can freely travel on the river. Not far from Pavlov, the river surface widens to 80 meters, becoming the capital people's favorite water sports field.

    The flow rate of the canal is more than 1,000 cubic meters per minute, part of which will be injected into the rivers and canals flowing through Sofia, passing through Sofia's parks and residential areas. After passing Pavlov, the project will serve as the western canal of the Sofia irrigation system, starting from Pavlov and surrounding the western Sofia Plain in a semi-circle, irrigating more than 200,000 decares of vegetable gardens, orchards, and fields planted with sunflowers and corn.

    Guaranteeing the Implementation of the Plan

    Although the overall plan will not be finally completed until 1975, many of the projects within it have already begun.

    Obviously, such a grand and arduous plan cannot be realized without the concerted efforts of the Party, the government, and the people, and without the support of the people of the whole country. Therefore, from the beginning, the Party paid great attention to the issue of following the mass line. The Party Committee not only widely absorbed the opinions of all relevant parties during the drafting of the overall plan for the reconstruction of Sofia; but also, after the design plan was made, used newspapers and periodicals to introduce it in detail, and mobilized the city's residents to launch discussions through the People's Committee and the various organizations of the Fatherland Front.

    In the process of carrying out the reconstruction work, the Party also emphasized adopting the approach of "pooling the wisdom and efforts of the masses." For example, the problem of housing construction, which Sofia urgently needs to solve, in addition to the state being responsible for building a part, the Party and the government pay more attention to promoting the method of solving it through state and resident cooperation. That is, the "housing savings" method: the state bank issues housing construction loans to workers, staff, agricultural production cooperative members, legal workers, and retired workers. The loan amount for each house is 40,000 leva, to be repaid in 25 years, with an annual interest rate of 2%. Because the housing loan interest rate is low and the term is long, it is convenient for the working people to allocate a part of their ever-increasing income to repay. This measure of encouraging and helping residents build houses best combines the care of the people's regime with the interests of the working people. They have created favorable conditions for expanding housing savings and accelerating housing construction. In recent years, Sofia's housing problem has been mainly solved by this method.

    The Result of Pooling the Wisdom and Efforts of the Masses

    The result of the Party's leadership relying on the masses for a long time has greatly enhanced the residents' sense of ownership. In Sofia, consciously participating in the construction of the capital has almost become a fine trend. Last year, all wage-earning workers in Sofia automatically donated 1% of their individual monthly wages to the state for urban construction. Later, the government used this money for the construction of sewers and water supply projects. This year, inspired by the new overall plan, people are vying to increase their donations to 2% of their individual monthly wages.

    If you go to the Pancharevo-Sofia Canal construction site, you can more intimately feel how the people of Sofia are expressing their approval of the overall plan with enthusiastic practical actions. Since the first labor symphony sounded on the canal construction site, 2,400 Sofia people have been engaged in voluntary labor here every day. Voluntary labor teams composed of college and middle school students have been working here throughout the summer vacation. The construction project of the Pancharevo-Sofia Canal is mainly completed by the voluntary labor organized by various agencies, organizations, and schools in the capital.

    The overall plan for the reconstruction of Sofia has now become the most common topic among the people of the capital. Whether in factory clubs or outdoor cafes, street gardens or bus stops, one can hear people arguing about this issue everywhere. Women are talking about the benefits of running street canteens; car drivers are calculating how to reduce the burden of street traffic in the case of a large increase in vehicles; traffic police are most concerned about the command and management after the intersection is rebuilt into a double layer; Young Pioneers are wondering what it's like to take a helicopter to Vitosha Mountain.

    Comrade Grozev, Secretary of the Sofia City Committee, said that one of the most reliable guarantees for the realization of the overall plan is the infinite enthusiasm of the people of Sofia for building socialism. These words are indeed thought-provoking.

    As we are about to say goodbye to Sofia, this lovely "garden city," Bulgarian friends must ask us to talk about our impressions of it. We can only tell them with a local proverb: "Sofia is growing all the time, but the longer it grows, the younger it gets." Isn't this our heartfelt words? Although our stay in Sofia was very short, it seemed that we felt its change every day. Of course, this is not only because the socialist mansions under construction are constantly developing towards the sky; more importantly, the boiling construction enthusiasm has entered people's lives.

    花园都市的远景
    本报记者　萧光
    保加利亚的每一座名城，都有它自己鲜明的特征。梯尔诺沃和普列文大量保存的历史遗迹，很容易使人联想到保加利亚的过去；伸展在马里查河和美丽如画的岩峰之间的普罗夫迪夫，商业特别繁荣；有着海滨砂丘和许多拜占庭教堂的?赛泊尔，被誉为“黑海的珍珠”；以风景幽美的海滨和金色沙滩著称的瓦尔那，每年吸引着成千上万的游客……。然而，在所有这些美丽的城市中间，最令我们难忘的，还是保加利亚人引为骄傲的索非亚。
    花园都市索非亚
    索非亚不仅在保加利亚，而且在全欧洲享有“花园都市”的盛名。称索非亚为花园都市，是很确切的。这座静卧在群山环绕中的城市，既具备现代都市生活的一切便利条件，也有着最美好的自然景色。
    风光媚人的维托沙山和留林山，构成了索非亚巍峨壮丽的背景。这些布满松树和山毛榉林的山环，时而呈青，时而转暗；没有固定的颜色。大自然随着天气的变幻、日头的出没，也不时调整山峰的衣色。而索非亚市区，却披挂着另一身特制的锦缎：碧绿的草坪、鲜艳的花坛，处处都是花园。初到索非亚的旅客，没有不喜欢作这样一次“标准散步”的：从季米特洛夫陵墓沿着俄罗斯林荫大道前行，直到鹰桥。一公里长的路，至少经过四座漂亮的花园。索非亚的花园、草场有六百处之多。每一个人都可以从这里找到自己心爱的角落来舒散一天的疲劳；孩子，则专有为他们开辟的儿童游戏场。
    其实，你就是在索非亚的交通要道上散步，也往往会产生置身园林的感觉。这里，几乎家家户户的门前窗下，都栽种着生意葱茏的花草；白净的墙壁上，爬满了青青绿绿的蔓藤。主要的街道由浅黄的缸砖一色铺成，首都的清洁工人每天晚上都用水把它们冲刷得干干净净。街道两旁，高大的树木像绿色标兵似的列队成行。从普通的白杨、菩提树、栗树、梣木直到阿拉伯橡胶和法国梧桐，全市的树木总有九万来株。
  这些植物的不断生长，不仅为首都的风貌增添了多少诗情画意，在炎热的夏日给城市以荫凉；尤其可贵的是，它们组成了一架巨大的自然滤净器，时刻不停地从空中排除一切有损居民健康的物质。
    在百花争妍的街心花园和公园里，立有许多精工雕琢的铜像和纪念碑。其中有保加利亚历代民族解放运动的伟大领袖，最有才华的革命作家和诗人；还有在争取自由的战斗里倒下的无名英雄。这些栩栩如生的雕像和那含意深远的诗行、警句，对于不曾流过血、经过战斗洗礼的年青一代，具有特别的教育意义。难怪共青团员们爱在这儿举行集会；教师也常领孩子们来悼念革命先辈，唤起他们对于保加利亚过去的回忆，使前人创造的历史在他们的眼前复活。装饰精美的喷泉，是索非亚的花园、广场另一个惹人注目的中心。无数根银线汇成的水柱，昼夜不停地从安琪儿的号角，从快乐跳跃的鱼、虾口中射向天空；白天，在阳光的辉映下，现出道道彩虹。索非亚的自来水光滑晶莹，丝毫没有沉淀，喝起来带一股淡淡的甜味。也许正因为它好喝，索非亚人喜爱地称之为“长寿水”，并在市内建立了许许多多小巧玲珑的饮水泉。
    并非从来就是这样
    外国客人对于索非亚人能在这样优美的环境中生息、劳动和创造，莫不啧啧称羡。保加利亚朋友却强调，这全是人们在新政权领导下取得的劳动成果。索非亚并非从来就是一座“花园都市”。它在第二次世界大战期间，遭到美英空军的严重轰炸，被炸毁的家庭不下一万二千五百多户，机关、企业也遭到了同样的灾难。全市几乎没有一座建筑物身上不带有战争的斑痕。今天的“花园都市”，正是在这样的基础上重建起来的。十五年来，党和政府引导索非亚人度过重重困难，不仅修补了旧的房屋，新建起成片的住宅区、学校、剧场、影院、医院……；而且把全市公园和花园的绿化面积，由战前的二千二百狄卡尔扩大到现在的四千多狄卡尔。
    如果你以为保加利亚人对首都的现状已经十分满足，那就完全错了。这里，人们有着不断前进的愿望。保共索非亚市委书记葛罗兹夫同志告诉我们，为了配合国家五年计划的进展，也为了解决目前由于城市人口迅速增长所引起的困难问题，例如住宅和城市供应设备不足与不合需要等，党和政府已决定继续改建和扩建索非亚，使它进一步适应巨大的社会主义建设事业的需要。
    索非亚改建工作的总体规划，已在今年5月1日拟制完成。当我们听了索非亚市人民委员会副主席兼总工程师柯捷夫同志和总建筑师季米特洛夫同志介绍这个规划的要点过后，不能不深为赞叹；社会主义制度是如何发扬了人民的向上心！
    改变首都对全国经济的影响
    总体规划不仅保证了1975年将增加为一百万人口的索非亚市区（九十万）和郊区（十万）居民享有劳动、休息和文化的一切条件，而且解决了一系列有关工业发展的问题。
    索非亚原是保加利亚主要的工业中心，它的工业和手工业产品占全国工业总产值的五分之一以上。然而，当索非亚附近的克列米科夫齐冶金联合企业建成以后，首都的工业将对全国经济起更大的影响。克列米科夫齐冶金联合企业是第三个五年计划期间最大的工程。这里发现的二亿五千多万吨铁矿富藏，足够供一个比现有的列宁冶金工厂大十倍的新钢铁联合企业用一百年。可以预计，克列米科夫齐冶金联合企业将大大增强首都在工业战线上的重要地位，索非亚将不只拥有发达的轻工业和加工工业，还将具有开采和冶炼黑色金属的雄厚的基础。
    索非亚现有的工业也将合并和扩大，对人体有害的工厂将被迁移到远离市区的地方。今后，工业人口仍是首都的主要居民。
    一切为了使居民劳动好休息好
    规划确定对人口集中和建筑不够卫生的市中心部分和郊区某些居民区的住宅进行改建。每个居民的平均住宅面积将由现在的六点五平方米增加到九平方米。公用事业方面也将有很大的改善。现在全市只有一半地区有下水道，1975年下水道将遍及全城。每个市民每天平均可以有生活用水四百公升，工业用水一百公升。首都电力网将改为二百二十伏特电压。热力化以后，蒸气和热水将能满足工业和大部分市区的需要。
    规划对郊区的农业生产提出了具体措施，使郊区农业保证供应首都居民新鲜的食品。预定郊区农业将近全部满足首都对蔬菜的需要，满足约88％的奶类需要和42％的水果需要。
    为了适应首都居民不断增长的文化生活的要求，文化俱乐部、电影院、剧院到1975年将增加两倍。每个学生平均占的学校面积将增加50％。每个儿童平均占幼儿园面积将增加一倍，卫生保健机构和商业网的指标也将增加近一倍。这些机构将有计划地分布市区和郊区各处，使它们能迅速平衡地为全体居民服务。
    交通网将进一步发展，继续完成已经开始建造的辐射网。市内各区同市中心、工业区、火车站、文化休息公园、运动场之间，都将有很好的联系。从市内最偏远的角落到市中心，最多只用四十五分钟。
    作为首都肺腑的绿化区，将在市内普遍建立，并且将大大扩大。公园和其他绿化面积将增加三倍，街道绿化工作将增加一倍。除了目前所有的自由公园，还将兴建西郊公园和南郊公园，使它们用常年的林带，把城市和维托沙山、留林山等联系起来。总之，市区每人平均的绿化面积将由现在的九平方米增加到五十六平方米，郊区绿化面积平均每人将有九百平方米。
    山城出现港口
    说来你也许难于置信：远离海洋和航运河道的保加利亚人民共和国首都，将有自己的港口——索非亚港！但这却是千真万确的事。总体规划决定了开凿一条宽阔的航行运河，把索非亚同几年以前建造的潘恰列沃人工湖联结起来，并且已经开始动工修建。不用两年，潘恰列沃—索非亚运河就将完工。这条沿岸辟有新式码头和风景秀丽的浴场的运河，定将为首都生色不少。运河的航行部分位于潘恰列沃湖和巴夫洛沃之间，长十七公里，宽达三十一点六米到三十五点二米。河上可以自由来往舢舨和载运二百位乘客的内河轮船。离巴夫洛沃不远，河面展宽到八十米，成为首都人民心爱的水上运动场。
    运河的流量是每分钟一千多立方米，其中一部分将注入流经索非亚的河流和渠道，穿过索非亚的公园和住宅区、过巴夫洛沃以后，工程将作为索非亚灌溉系统的西部干渠，从巴夫洛沃开始呈半圆形环绕索非亚平原西部，灌溉二十多万狄卡尔菜园、果园和种植向日葵、玉蜀黍的田地。
    实现规划的保证
    总体规划虽说要到1975年才能最后完工，但其中的许多项目现在已着手进行。
    显然，这样一个规模宏伟、任务艰巨的计划，没有党、政府和人民的同心同德，没有全国人民的支援是根本不可能实现的。因此党从一开始就十分注意走群众路线的问题。党委不仅在改建索非亚的总体规划拟制期间，广泛吸收各有关方面的意见；而且在设计方案制成以后，利用报刊详为介绍、通过人民委员会和祖国阵线的各级组织，发动全市居民展开讨论。
    在具体进行改建工作的过程中，党同样也强调采取“群策群力”的方针。譬如索非亚目前迫切需要解决的住宅建设的问题，除了由国家负责建造一部分外，党和政府更注重推广用国家和居民合作的方式来解决。也就是“住宅储蓄”的办法：由国家银行向工人、职员、农业生产合作社社员、法律工作者和退休工作人员发放住宅建设贷款。每所住宅的贷款额是四万列弗，二十五年还清，年息二厘。由于住宅贷款利息低，期限长，就便利于劳动人民从自己不断增长的收入中拨出一部分款项偿还。这种鼓励和帮助居民建设住宅的措施，把人民政权的关怀和劳动人民的利益最好地结合在一起了。它们为扩大住宅储蓄和加速住宅建设创造了有利的条件。这几年索非亚的居住问题，主要就是靠这种办法解决的。
    群策群力的结果
    党的领导长期依靠群众的结果，大大提高了居民主人翁的感觉。在索非亚，自觉地参加首都建设，几乎已成为一种优良的风气。去年，索非亚所有领工资的劳动人民，都曾把个人一个月工资的1％，自动捐给国家进行城市建设。后来，政府把这笔钱用到了修建下水道和自来水供应的工程上。今年，人们为新的总体规划所鼓舞，争着把捐款增加到个人一个月工资的2％。
    如果你上潘恰列沃—索非亚运河工地上去看看，就能更亲切地感到，索非亚人是以怎样热烈的实际行动来表示他们对总体规划的赞同。自从运河工地上响起了第一曲劳动交响乐以来，每天都有二千四百个索非亚人在这里进行义务劳动。大中学生组成的义务劳动队，整个暑假都在这里干活。潘恰列沃—索非亚运河的修建工程，主要就靠首都各机关、团体、学校组织义务劳动来完成。
    改建索非亚的总体规划，如今已成了首都人民最普遍的话题。不论在工厂俱乐部或是露天咖啡馆、街心花园或是公共汽车站，到处可以听到人们关于这个问题的争论。妇女们念叨大办街道食堂的好处；汽车司机合算在车辆大大增加的情况下，如何减轻街道流动量的负担；交通警察最关心的是岔道口改建双层后的指挥和管理；少先队员却揣摩搭直升飞机上维托沙山是怎么个滋味。
    索非亚市委书记格罗兹夫同志说过，实现总体规划的最可靠的保证之一，就是索非亚人建设社会主义的无限热情。这话确是耐人寻味的。
    当我们即将同索非亚这座可爱的“花园都市”告别的时候，保加利亚朋友定要我们谈谈对它的印象。我们只好以当地的一句谚语相告：“索非亚无时不在生长，但愈长愈年青”。难道这不是我们的衷心之言吗？我们在索非亚逗留时间虽很短，但每天每天都似乎感到它的改变。当然，这不只是建造中的社会主义大厦时刻在向高空发展；更重要的是，沸腾的建设热情进入了人们的生活中间。
