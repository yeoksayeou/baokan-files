Hunan: Commune-Run Industry Launches a Movement to "Do Nine Good Things for Agriculture and Save 30% of Labor"
Zhejiang: County, Commune, and Team Industries Actively Rush to Produce and Trial-Produce Various Agricultural Tools for This Winter and Next Spring

(Our newspaper, Changsha, 28th dispatch) Hunan Province's commune industry is launching a production movement to "do nine good things for agriculture and save 30% of labor," supporting the continued leap forward in agricultural production and accelerating the transformation of agricultural technology.

Recently, Hunan Province held an on-site conference on commune industry in the Nan Yue Commune of Hengshan County, issuing a new battle call to commune industries across the province. It demanded that in the coming year, commune industries "do nine good things for agriculture and save 30% of labor." The nine good things are: (1) Realize self-flowing water for public canteen use through bamboo pipes; (2) Expedite the realization of transportation through carts, boats, and chutes; (3) Implement explosive blasting for water conservancy projects; (4) Innovate farm tools and repair them locally; (5) Achieve the universal use of rice transplanters; (6) Achieve the universal use of rice threshers; (7) Achieve the universal use of rice harvesting tools; (8) Achieve the universal use of water, animal, and electric-powered tools for processing grain, oil, and feed; (9) Ensure that all rotating machinery is equipped with ball bearings. After achieving these nine good things, the industrial departments of each commune are required to further save 30% of labor for agriculture by vigorously carrying out tool reforms and comprehensively utilizing water conservancy to support the great development of agricultural production.

Over the past year, Hunan Province's commune industry has achieved tremendous development. By the end of October this year, there were more than 40,000 commune-run industrial and mining enterprises with more than 790,000 employees. Now, every commune has a farm tool and machinery factory or repair shop, production brigades have farm tool repair stations, and production teams have mobile repair groups, with a total of more than 270,000 people engaged in farm tool repair and manufacturing, basically establishing a province-wide farm tool machinery repair and manufacturing network. Short-distance specialized transportation networks and agricultural and sideline product processing networks are also gradually forming throughout the province. From January to September this year, a total of 28.87 million farm tools of various types were repaired and manufactured, and more than 2 million tons of various types of indigenous fertilizers and pesticides were produced. Commune industry has also played a significant role in supporting national heavy industry and meeting market and member living needs. The Nan Yue Commune industry in Hengshan County has achieved remarkable results in supporting agriculture. They adopted the method of "one water source, multiple uses, and growing melons on long vines," extensively utilizing water power, establishing 48 hydropower stations, and driving a total of more than 200 machines for grain processing, oil pressing, water milling, hulling, papermaking pulping, slicing, and milling, equivalent to 678 horsepower. This increased work efficiency by three to thirteen times compared to manual labor, saving 493,000 labor days throughout the year, equivalent to increasing the labor force by 1,643 people, setting an example for commune industries across the province. After the provincial commune industry on-site conference, commune industries have been learning from the Nan Yue Commune, launching a production upsurge centered on "vigorously carrying out tool reforms and comprehensively utilizing water power," putting forward the battle slogan of "demand raw materials from high mountains, demand power from flowing water, demand fertilizer from stones, and demand labor from tools," concentrating major efforts on crash programs for fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy, transportation construction, and agricultural and sideline product processing tools, as well as the production, repair, reform, and promotion of farm tools, completing the production tasks of farm tools, implements, electrical appliances, fertilizers, and lime needed for next year's spring plowing one quarter ahead of schedule, reversing the phenomenon of "temporary rush" in previous years.

In the production movement to realize "doing nine good things and saving 30% of labor," the leading departments of various commune industries have also taken specific measures. On the one hand, they mobilized the vast number of employees to offer suggestions and tap potential, improve technology, and promote advanced experience; on the other hand, they adopted ten measures, including tapping potential, finding substitutes, clearing inventory, utilizing waste products, saving raw materials, comprehensively utilizing raw materials, changing product designs, vigorously promoting collaboration, establishing raw material quotas, and establishing raw material bases, to vigorously grasp raw material production and supply, ensuring the early realization of the slogan "doing nine good things for agriculture and saving 30% of labor."

(Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 28th dispatch) Zhejiang Province has basically formed a province-wide machinery manufacturing and repair network serving agricultural production. Every county has an agricultural machinery factory, every commune has a farm tool factory, and every team (production brigade) has a farm tool repair station, and every production team has a door-to-door repair and maintenance service. According to statistics, among the 50 counties in the province, there are 57 county-run agricultural machinery factories; among the more than 600 people's communes in the province, there are a total of 675 commune-run farm tool factories, as well as more than 7,000 repair stations. These factories and repair stations, like bunches of grapes, are spread throughout the province's counties, towns, and villages, playing a huge role in agricultural production and agricultural technology transformation.

These small and medium-sized agricultural machinery factories in Zhejiang Province were established last winter and this spring after communization, based on the needs of agricultural production and adapting to local conditions. Most of the county agricultural machinery factories have equipment combining indigenous and foreign methods, such as lathes, drilling machines, planers, grinders, and boring machines. Commune farm tool factories also have equipment such as iron-wood structure lathes. Most of these factories have workshops for casting, turning, fitting, and metalwork. The workers in agricultural machinery factories and farm tool factories were originally iron, wood, and bamboo handicraft workers and farmers. They quickly mastered the technology through hard study and drilling for half a year, using methods of "inviting in" to teach and "sending out" to learn. The commune members working in various repair stations are mostly semi-workers and semi-farmers. These factories rely on their own efforts to solve the problem of raw materials. The vast majority of them use local materials, utilizing bamboo and wood, utilizing old copper and scrap iron, indigenous iron, and utilizing offcuts from large factories to manufacture various farm tools.

These agricultural machinery factories, farm tool factories, and farm tool repair stations have manufactured a wide variety of agricultural machinery and improved farm tools. From January to November 20th this year, they have manufactured 26.85 million farm tools of various sizes, including thousands of types of farm tools for deep plowing, threshing, and agricultural and sideline product processing; they have also trial-produced more than 200 new types of farm tools such as electric plows and electric threshers according to the needs of the commune, putting them into production and promoting 3.3 million pieces in a timely manner after testing. Workers in agricultural machinery factories and commune farm tool factories in various counties have also organized repair and maintenance service teams and mobile repair boats to go deep into production teams and, together with the workers in repair stations, repair old equipment door-to-door. From January to November 20th this year, the province has repaired 41.82 million various farm tools and machinery and more than 100,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage equipment.

Workers in county and commune agricultural machinery factories and farm tool factories actively launched a technical innovation movement. The No. 1 machine tool worker in the Jiaxing Xin Cheng Farm Tool Factory successfully tested three technical innovations, such as "turning and milling combination," increasing work efficiency by three to five times, completing three months of work in one month, and achieving 100% product quality, greatly accelerating the progress of work. Workers in the Longyou County Agricultural Machinery Factory improved forging manual operation, using electric power to drive the hammer, increasing work efficiency by five to ten times, not only completing the manufacturing tasks of electric power, foot-powered sweet potato shredders, and hoes in a timely manner, but also producing 20 bench vices and 8 hand-cranked screw machines for the commune, equipping the commune's farm tool factory.

Currently, agricultural machinery factories and farm tool factories and farm tool repair stations in various counties and communes are actively rushing to manufacture a large number of agricultural machinery and farm tools for this winter and next spring, and many new farm tool trial production groups and research groups are also trial-producing various new types of farm tools day and night.

    湖南：社办工业开展为农业“做九件好事省三成劳力”运动
    浙江：县、社、队工业积极为今冬明春赶制和试制各种农具
    本报长沙28日电　湖南省公社工业开展为农业“做九件好事，省三成劳力”的生产运动，支援农业生产继续跃进，加速农业技术改造。
    最近，湖南省在衡山县南岳公社召开了公社工业现场会议，向全省公社工业发出新的战斗号召，要求各公社工业今明年要为农业“做九件好事，省三成劳力”，九件好事是：（1）实现公共食堂用水竹筒溜水自流化；（2）尽速实现运输车、船、滑槽化；（3）水利工程炸药爆破化；（4）革新农具，就地整修农具；（5）做到插秧普遍使用插秧机；（6）做到打稻普遍使用打稻机；（7）做到割禾普遍使用割禾器；（8）粮、油、饲料加工普遍使用水、畜、电力工具加工；（9）做到各种转动机具都能安装上滚珠轴承。在做到这九件好事后，要求每个公社的工业部门，为支援农业生产的大发展，大搞工具改革和综合利用水利，再为农业节约三成的劳动力。
    一年来，湖南省公社工业获得巨大发展，到今年10月底止，全省公社办的工矿企业单位四万多个，职工人数七十九万多人。现在每个公社都有农具农械厂或修配厂，生产大队有农具修配站，生产小队有流动修理组，从事农具修造的共达二十七万多人，已基本上建成了全省的农具机械修造网。短途专业运输网、农副产品加工网也正在全省逐步形成。今年一至三季度，共修制了各种农具二千八百八十七万件，生产各种土化肥、土农药二百多万吨。公社工业在支援国家大工业、满足市场和社员生活需要等方面，也起了很大作用。衡山县南岳公社工业在支援农业等方面取得了显著成绩，他们采取“一水多用、长藤结瓜”的办法，广泛利用水力，建立水力站四十八处，带动粮食加工机、榨油水碾、剥壳机、造纸打浆机、刨丝切片机、磨粉机等共二百多部，相等于六百七十八马力，比人力分别提高工效三至十三倍，全年可节约劳动日四十九万三千多个，等于增加劳力一千六百四十三人，为全省公社工业树立了榜样。全省公社工业现场会议以后，公社工业纷纷向南岳公社学习，围绕农业生产，掀起了“大搞工具改革和综合利用水力”为中心内容的生产热潮，提出“向高山要原料，向流水要动力，向石头要肥料，向工具要劳力”的战斗口号，集中主要力量，突击积肥和水利、交通建设、农副产品加工三大工具，和农具的生产、修配、改革和推广，提早一个季度完成明年春耕生产所需要的农具、工具、电具、化肥、石灰的生产任务，扭转往年“临时赶忙”的现象。
    在为实现“做九件好事，省三成劳力”的生产运动中，各公社工业领导部门还采取了具体措施，一方面发动广大职工献计挖潜力，提高技术，推广先进经验；另方面采取挖潜力、找代用品、清仓、利用废品、节省原料、综合利用原料、改变产品设计、大搞协作、建立原材料定额、建立原材料基地等十项办法，大抓原材料生产和供应，保证为农业“做九件好事、省三成劳力”的口号早日实现。
    本报杭州28日电　浙江省已基本形成了一个全省范围的为农业生产服务的机械制造修配网。县县有农业机械厂、社社有农具厂、队队（生产大队）有农具修配站，每个生产小队都有登门修旧的修配担。据统计，全省五十个县，有县办农业机械厂五十七个；全省六百多个人民公社，共有社办农具厂六百七十五个，还有七千多个修配站。这些工厂和修配站，像葡萄串一样的遍布全省各个县城、市镇和农村，对农业生产和农业技术改造发挥了巨大作用。
    浙江省这些中小型农业机械厂都是在去冬今春公社化后，根据农业生产的需要，因地制宜办起来的。县的农业机械厂大部分具有土洋结合的车床、钻床、刨床、磨床以及镗钢机等设备。公社农具厂也具有铁木结构的车床等设备。这些厂大部分都设有铸工、车工、钳工、金工等车间。农业机械厂和农具厂的工人都是原来的铁、木、竹手工业工人和农民，他们采取“请进来”教和“派出去”学的办法，经过半年时间的苦学苦钻，很快就掌握了技术。在各个修配站工作的公社社员，大部是半工半农。这些厂自力更生解决原料问题，绝大部分都是就地取材，利用竹木，利用旧铜废铁、土铁和利用大工厂的边角料，制造出各种农具。
    这些农业机械厂、农具厂和农具修配站，制造了多种大量的农业机械和改良农具，今年1月到11月20日止，已制造了大小农具二千六百八十五万件，包括深耕、脱粒、农副产品加工等几千种农具；还根据公社需要试制成功电动犁和电动脱粒机等二百多种新式农具，经过试验后及时投入生产，推广了三百三十万件。各县农业机械厂、公社农具厂工人，还组织了上山修配担、巡回修配船，深入生产队，和修配站工人一起上门修旧，今年1月到11月20日止，全省已修理各种农具机械四千一百八十二万件和十多万匹马力的排灌设备。
    县、社农业机械厂和农具厂工人积极开展技术革新运动。嘉兴具新塍农具厂一号机床工人试验成功了“车、铣结合”等三项技术革新，工效提高三到五倍，一个月完成了三个月的工作量，产品质量达到100％，大大加快了工作进度。龙游县农业机械厂工人改进了锻工手工操作，用电力带动起锤，提高工效五到十倍，不仅及时完成电力、脚踏番薯刨丝机和锄头等农具的制造任务，还为公社生产了二十台台虎钳、八台手摇螺丝机，武装了公社农具厂。
    现在，各县、社农业机械厂和农具厂、农具修配站正在积极为今冬明春赶制大量农业机械和农具，许多新农具试制小组和研究小组也正在日夜试制各种新式农具。
