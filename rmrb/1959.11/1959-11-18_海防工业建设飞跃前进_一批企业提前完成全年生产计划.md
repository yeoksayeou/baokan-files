Hanoi, November 17th (by our correspondent) The well-known industrial city and port of Haiphong in North Vietnam has made tremendous achievements in industrial production and basic construction this year, and it is playing an increasingly important role in the socialist construction of the North.

According to statistics from the Haiphong City Industrial Bureau, among the thirty enterprises under central and local authorities, enterprises and departments such as the yarn factory, pharmaceutical factory, waterworks, and railway transportation have already overfulfilled their annual production plans. As of the end of September, the total output value of the thirty-nine enterprises increased by 60% compared with the same period last year. In terms of basic construction, this year's total investment is nearly double that of last year. The throughput of Haiphong Port this year will increase by more than 50% compared with last year. At present, enterprises in Haiphong are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Labor Party, deeply carrying out the "Patriotic Emulation Movement," and preparing to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Labor Party with the achievement of completing and overfulfilling this year's production plans.

After French colonialists invaded Vietnam in 1884, they began to establish industries in Haiphong. However, in the long period of nearly eighty years, the French colonialists only built nine factories, and the phosphate fertilizer plant stopped production in 1940. The largest cement plant had a maximum annual output of only 300,000 tons. Before the liberation of Haiphong in 1955, the French colonialists also extensively sabotaged these outdated factories, so that at the initial stage of takeover, only the power plant and water plant in Haiphong City were able to carry out production. However, under the leadership of the Labor Party, the working class of Haiphong City completely restored the production of the old factories in less than a year, and at the same time built a new shipyard. In 1957, except for a few products, it had basically reached the economic level of the most prosperous year under French rule in 1939 before the war. In the past few years, according to the needs of the national economy, Haiphong City has newly built twenty-one factories.

The leap-forward development of industry in Haiphong has made great contributions to the socialist construction of North Vietnam and the improvement of people's living standards. It supplies daily necessities to various places every year, with yarn reaching more than 26 tons and soap nearly 2,000 tons. The raw materials and machines it produces, such as cement, phosphate fertilizer, "51-step plow," water pumps, threshers, sugar making machines, cotton ginning machines, and various machine parts, have strongly supported industrial construction and agricultural production in various places. In addition, it has also repaired and manufactured many ships to serve the transportation in the North.

    海防工业建设飞跃前进
    一批企业提前完成全年生产计划
    本报河内17日电　越南北方著名的工业城市和港口海防市，今年的工业生产和基本建设取得了巨大的成绩，它在北方的社会主义建设中日益起着重大的作用。
    根据海防市工业局的统计，中央和地方所属的三十个企业中，目前已有绒线厂、制药厂、自来水厂、铁道运输等企业和部门超额完成了今年全年的生产计划。截至9月底为止，三十九个企业的总产值比去年同期增加了60％。在基本建设方面，今年的投资总额比去年增加近一倍。海防港口今年的吞吐量将比去年增加50％以上。目前，海防市各企业正热烈响应劳动党的号召，深入开展“爱国竞赛运动”，准备用完成和超额完成今年的生产计划的成绩来庆祝劳动党建党三十周年。
    法国殖民主义者1884年侵入越南以后，就开始在海防建立工业，但是在近八十年的漫长时期里，法国殖民者只建立了九家工厂，而且其中的磷肥厂从1940年就停止了生产。最大的水泥厂，它的最高年产量也不过三十万吨。1955年海防解放前夕，法国殖民者又对这些设备陈旧的工厂大肆破坏，以致接管初期，海防市只剩发电厂和自来水厂能够进行生产。但是，海防市的工人阶级在劳动党的领导下，在不到一年的时间，就使旧的工厂完全恢复了生产，同时新建了一个造船厂。1957年除了少数产品以外，已经基本上达到了战前1939年法国统治时期经济最繁盛的一年的水平。几年来，根据国民经济的需要，海防市已经新建了二十一个工厂。
    海防市工业的飞跃发展，对越南北方的社会主义建设和提高人民生活水平作出了巨大贡献。它每年供应各地的日用品，仅绒线就达二十六吨以上，肥皂近两千吨；它生产的原料和机器，如水泥、磷肥、“51步犁”、水泵、脱谷机、制糖机、榨棉机和各种机器零件，有力地支援了各地的工业建设和农业生产。此外，它还修配、制造了不少船只，为北方的交通运输服务。
