Short commentary:

    The achievements of Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Guangxi, Jilin and other places in vigorously developing small-scale petroleum industries provide a strong example for implementing the policy of "walking on two legs" in developing the petroleum industry.
    A year ago, we emphasized that to develop the petroleum industry at high speed, in addition to conscientiously running the "ocean-going fleet" of petroleum enterprises, we must also vigorously develop "small-earth fleet" enterprises and medium-sized and small-sized enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods. The ocean-going fleet enterprises and the small-earth fleet enterprises are the two legs of the petroleum industry. With the ocean-going fleet, the modern "leg," we can drive the entire petroleum industry to continuously improve; with the small-earth fleet, the simplified "leg," we can make the petroleum industry bloom everywhere. Jinbei Prefecture in Shanxi Province originally did not produce a drop of oil. Since the central government proposed vigorously developing small-earth fleet enterprises, in just over a year, twelve counties and one city in the prefecture have established their own refineries, enabling the region's automobiles, tractors, and irrigation and drainage power machinery to use fuel oil produced by themselves. Doesn't this speed vividly prove that the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" is the only correct policy for developing the petroleum industry at high speed? Doesn't it fully demonstrate that small-scale petroleum industries have great potential?
    Can small refineries stand firm and gradually improve? A year ago, some people had doubts about this question. Facts have proved that this doubt is unfounded. New things always develop forward according to their own path. When various places initially started small-scale petroleum enterprises, due to a lack of technical and management experience, many things were not immediately easy to handle. After exploration and learning, these small-earth fleet enterprises not only stood firm but also did everything possible to recover and utilize all resources that could be utilized, developing towards the small ocean-going fleet stage of comprehensive utilization. When the Teng County First Coking Plant in Shandong Province started recovering coal tar, it only had a broken distillation pot. Now it has three new distillation pots with a processing capacity of one to one and a half tons. The cooling equipment initially made of galvanized iron pipes and broken wooden boxes has been replaced with serpentine coil coolers. It can be seen that small-scale petroleum enterprises, like steel and other "small-earth fleet" industries, have vigorous vitality.
    China's coal resources are extremely rich. Almost every province has coal mines. If places that produce coal set up medium-sized and small-sized coal refineries and vigorously engage in comprehensive utilization, what a great benefit it would be!
    Since the Great Leap Forward, the demand for petroleum products has been increasing day by day. Industry needs petroleum, and transportation also needs petroleum. In particular, after the task of accelerating the realization of agricultural technological transformation was proposed, the amount of oil used in rural areas will also become greater and greater. For example, using diesel engines as irrigation and drainage power can save a lot of steel compared to the steam boiler. The manufacturing cost is also lower. However, to replace steam boilers with diesel engines, the first requirement is to have enough diesel fuel. Therefore, the development of the petroleum industry is not only directly related to the continued leap forward in industrial production but also directly affects the leap forward in agricultural production. To adapt to the situation of continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, all places with conditions can vigorously develop small and medium-sized coal refineries to ensure the petroleum needed for the leap forward in industry and agriculture.

### 小炼油厂大有前途

    小炼油厂大有前途
    黑龙江、山西、广西、吉林等地大办小型石油工业的成就，对于发展石油工业必须贯彻两条腿走路的方针提供了有力的例证。
    一年以前，我们曾经强调指出：要高速度地发展石油工业，除了必须认真办好“大洋群”的石油企业而外，还必须大办“小土群”企业和土洋结合的中小型企业。大洋群企业和小土群企业就是石油工业的两条腿。有了大洋群、现代化的“腿”，才能带动整个石油工业不断提高；有了小土群、简易化的“腿”，才能使石油工业遍地开花。山西晋北专区原来是一滴油也不生产的，自从中央提出大办小土群企业以后，不过一年多时间，专区十二个县和一个市都办起了自己的炼油厂，使本地区的汽车、拖拉机和排灌动力机械用上了自己生产的燃料油。这种速度，不正是最生动地证明了党的“两条腿走路”方针是高速度发展石油工业的唯一的正确方针吗？不正充分地证明着小型石油工业大有可为吗？
    小型炼油厂能不能站稳脚跟，逐步提高呢？对于这个问题，一年以前，是有人抱怀疑态度的。事实证明这种怀疑是没有根据的。新生事物总是要按照自己的道路向前发展的。各地初办小型石油企业的时候，由于缺乏技术经验和管理经验，许多事情并不是一下子就是那末得心应手的。经过摸索学习，这些小土群企业不仅站稳了脚跟，而且千方百计，回收、利用一切可以利用的资源，向着综合利用的小洋群阶段发展了。山东滕县第一焦化厂开始回收焦油时，只有一个破蒸馏锅，现在已有了三台处理量一吨至一吨半的新蒸馏锅，最初用的白铁管和破木箱做的冷却设备，已经换上了蛇式曲管冷却器了。由此可见，小型石油企业正像钢铁和其它的“小土群”工业一样，是有着旺盛的生命力的。
    我国煤炭资源极为丰富，差不多每个省都有煤矿，如果产煤的地方都办起中小型煤炼油厂，大搞综合利用，该是多么大的收益呀！
    大跃进以来，石油产品的需要量日益增加，工业需要石油，交通运输也需要石油，特别是加速实现农业技术改造的任务提出后，农村用油量也将愈来愈大。例如，用柴油机作为排灌动力比起锅驼机可以节省很多钢铁，制造成本也要低些。但是，要把锅驼机改为柴油机，首先就是要有足够的柴油。所以石油工业的发展，不仅直接关系到工业生产的继续跃进，而且也直接影响到农业生产的跃进。为了适应工农业生产继续跃进的形势，一切有条件的地方都可大办中小煤炼油厂，以保证工农业跃进所需的石油。
