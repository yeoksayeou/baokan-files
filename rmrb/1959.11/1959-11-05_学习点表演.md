    Learning a Bit of Performance
    Qi Dongye
    In the old days of the theater world, the upstage and downstage entrances were called "ghost passages," implying life and death. Of course, the so-called life and death here mainly refers to artistic creation, meaning: once you step onto the stage, you must devote your whole heart and soul to artistic creation, until you leave the stage.
    I have seen some solo singers or instrumentalists who have good tone and technique, but they think that the appeal of art lies only in singing or technique, and therefore greatly neglect the art of performance that matches the content of the performance, singing or playing stiffly, which does not allow the audience to feel what they are performing through the overall performance of the actor (singing, expression, action, etc.); some are better and can pay attention to performance in the singing, but unfortunately, they cannot carry it through, thinking that the appeal of art is only at the time of the performance, and once the performance is over, the emotion is interrupted accordingly, and they bow hastily and leave, failing to consolidate the impression of the performance just now through their stage image again. If we compare it with the previous meaning, this is: before they even come in, the artistic life has already ended, which is unsatisfactory.
    Good actors are not like this. Some time ago, I heard Comrade Guo Lanying's solo at a concert. She understood this principle very well. She sang several songs in a row, and her movements and expressions changed greatly accordingly. Xiao Qin was Xiao Qin, Liu Hulan was Liu Hulan, and others were different, not the same at all, and not only did she begin to feel the character before singing, but even after the singing ended and even when taking a bow, she still maintained the character's emotions, and the way she took a bow also changed with the content of the singing. The audience felt very satisfied. Another example: the reason why Comrade Zhang Changcheng's *banhu* solo is popular with the audience is precisely because his whole body is "playing" with his *banhu*. The emotion remains after the song ends, leaving people with endless aftertaste.
    In order to make our singing and playing art play a more perfect and touching effect, I would like to venture to make a suggestion to comrades in solo singing and playing: learn a bit of performance.

    学习点表演
    齐东野
    旧时的戏剧界，把上下场门叫做“鬼门道”，有出生入死的意思。自然，此处所谓生死，主要是艺术创造而言，意谓：一出台帘即须全身心都为艺术创造服务，直到进帘方休。
    我见过一些独唱或独奏的演员，音色、技巧都不错，但他们以为艺术的感染力只在歌唱或技法之间，因而大大地忽略了与演奏的内容相称的表演艺术，呆板地唱、呆板地奏，结果不能让观众通过演员的整体（歌唱、表情、动作等等）去感受他所演奏的东西；有的好些、能在演唱中注意表演，但惜乎不能贯串，以为艺术的感染就只在演奏的当时，演奏既完，情绪随之中断，草草谢幕而下，不能把刚才演奏的印象通过自己的舞台形象再来一次巩固。如果对照一下前边的那番意思，这就是：还没进来，艺术生命已经终结了，令人不满足。
    好演员不然，前些时候，在一次音乐会上听过郭兰英同志的独唱，她就很懂得这个道理，一连唱了几支歌，动作、表情都随之有很大的变化，小芹是小芹、刘胡兰是刘胡兰、还有其他，绝不类同，而且不仅在演唱之前就开始了人物的感觉，即使演唱结束后甚至到谢幕时依然保持着人物的情绪，谢幕的方式也随着演唱的内容，而有所变化。观众感到很大的满足。另一个例子：张长城同志的板胡独奏之所以使观众喜欢，也正因为他的全身都和他的板胡一齐“演奏”。曲终情绪在，令人回味无穷。
    为了使我们的歌唱演奏艺术更能完美地发挥感人效果，愿意冒昧地向独唱和独奏的同志提一建议：学习点表演。
