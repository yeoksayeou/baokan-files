Under the Counterattack of the South African People
The South African Authorities' Conspiracy to Persecute Mrs. Mafeking Failed

    (Reported by "Workers' Daily" in London) With the vigorous support of the South African people, the South African authorities' conspiracy to exile Mrs. Mafeking has failed.

    As previously reported, Mrs. Mafeking is the chairperson of the African Food and Canning Workers' Union and the vice-chairperson of the Women's Department of the African National Congress of South Africa. She has been persecuted by the South African colonial authorities for engaging in the South African people's struggle for independence.

    On the morning of November 9th, in Paarl, the center of the South African Federation's brewing and fruit processing industry, the South African white authorities sent police to Mrs. Mafeking's home, intending to arrest her and exile her to a place seven hundred miles away. However, Mrs. Mafeking had already left home after hearing the news. Thereupon, the authorities dispatched a large number of military police, driving armored vehicles to search everywhere, repeatedly declaring that they must catch Mrs. Mafeking. The masses showed great anger at the authorities' barbaric actions. Disregarding the beatings and arrests by the authorities' military police, they still gathered and held demonstrations. At the same time, the police authorities had to admit that they did not know any information about Mrs. Mafeking's whereabouts.

    Before leaving her hometown, Mrs. Mafeking published an appeal to African women. The appeal stated: "The Nationalist Party government's laws bring the deepest suffering to mothers." Therefore, South African women "must stand together, unite, and fight for freedom." "The struggle must continue!"

    News from South Africa indicates that the South African white authorities have not given up the idea of persecuting Mrs. Mafeking. Mrs. Mafeking and her family are still in danger of persecution. This is the persecuted Mrs. Mafeking and her family. She is holding her youngest child, who is only two and a half months old. The other ten children, the oldest being only twenty-one years old. The daughter in the back row is holding her grandson. Her husband is sitting on the left. There is also a ninety-five-year-old father-in-law in the family.

    在南非人民群众的反击下
    南非当局迫害马费肯夫人的阴谋失败
    本报讯　据伦敦“工人日报”报道：在南非人民的大力支援下，南非当局放逐马费肯夫人的阴谋已告失败。
    前已报道，马费肯夫人是非洲食品和罐头业工人工会主席和南非非洲人国民大会妇女部副主席，她由于从事南非人民的独立斗争，受到南非殖民当局的迫害。
    11月9日清晨，在南非联邦酿酒业和水果加工业中心巴尔，南非白人当局派警察到马费肯夫人家中，打算把她逮捕并流放到七百里外的一个地方去，但是，马费肯夫人早已闻讯离开了家。于是，当局便出动大批军警，开着装甲车到处搜捕，一再声言一定要抓到马费肯夫人。群众对当局的蛮横行动表现了极大的愤怒，他们不顾当局军警的殴打和逮捕，仍然聚集起来，举行示威。同时，警察当局不得不承认，他们不知道任何有关马费肯夫人的踪迹。
    马费肯夫人在离开她的家乡以前曾发表了一封致非洲妇女的呼吁书。呼吁书写道：“南非国民党政府的法令带给做母亲的人最深重的苦难。”因此，南非妇女们“必须站在一起，团结起来，为自由而战斗。”“斗争必须坚持下去！”
    从南非来的消息表明，南非白人当局并没有放弃迫害马费肯夫人的念头。马费肯夫人和她的家庭仍然处在受迫害的危险中。这是被迫害的马费肯夫人一家，她抱着的是生下来才两个半月的最小的孩子，其余十个孩子，最大的才二十一岁。后排女儿手中抱着的是外孙。左面坐着的是她的丈夫。家中还有一个年已九十五岁的老公公。
