A Casual Talk on the Moon
Zhang Yuzhe, Director of the Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences

On October 4th of this year, our great ally, the Soviet Union, launched its third cosmic rocket, the automatic interplanetary station. It transmitted photographs of the far side of the moon, which had never been seen by humankind, to the ground using television technology. While we sing praises of the achievements of Soviet science and technology, and the rapid progress in the cause of conquering outer space, we naturally develop an endless interest in the moon in the sky.

The Moon's Rotation and Revolution

Many people find it difficult to understand the phenomenon of the moon's rotation. They say that if the moon is rotating there, we should be able to see all its sides. Why can we only ever see one side of the moon? I think this should be seen as a matter of position and perspective. I am referring to the physical position and perspective, not the political position and perspective. If you stand on Earth and look at Tiananmen, you will naturally say that Tiananmen always faces south, and there is no rotation. If you did a somersault like Sun Wukong and looked at Tiananmen from mid-air, you would find that the constellations of the zodiac that Tiananmen faces are constantly changing, from Gemini to Taurus to Aries to Pisces... rotating in turn, repeating every 24 hours. Obviously, Tiananmen is rotating there. The situation of the moon is similar to that of Tiananmen. When you look from Earth, you will see that the moon always faces you with a fixed side, so you feel that it is not rotating. But if you look from mid-air, the constellation that a certain side of the moon faces is also constantly changing. The only difference is that it rotates slower than Tiananmen, taking twenty-seven or eight days to repeat.

The moon now revolves around the earth in 27 1/3 days. If the time it takes for the moon to rotate once is less or more than this number of days, in other words, if the moon rotates faster or slower than it actually does, we people on Earth would still have the opportunity to see all sides of the moon. But the moon's rotation period happens to be exactly equal to its revolution period around the earth. This makes the moon face the earth with one side forever, preventing people from ever seeing the secrets of the far side of the moon. If what I have said here has not made the reasoning clear, I am willing to make a simple analogy. In the countryside, there is a type of waterwheel powered by livestock. It consists of a wooden gear about two meters in diameter placed horizontally. When an ox is harnessed to it and starts moving, it causes the gear to rotate around a vertical axis. The teeth of the wheel move the machinery, pumping water to the fields. If the herdsboy driving the ox sits in the center of the large gear, then as the ox continuously circles around pushing the waterwheel, the herdsboy will always only see one side of the ox's body. Let's say the ox is rotating clockwise. When the ox is in the north, its head faces east; when the ox is in the east, its head faces south; when the ox is in the south, its head faces west; when the ox is in the west, its head faces north, returning to the north, the ox's head also returns to the east-facing position. The ox's head returning from facing east to facing east can be said to be one rotation. During the same time, the ox goes from the north of the gear back to the north of the gear, which can be considered to be one revolution around the herdsboy. Since this revolution and rotation period are exactly equal, the herdsboy only ever sees one side of the ox. If you carefully understand the situation of the ox pushing the waterwheel, then the problem of the moon's rotation and revolution will not be difficult to understand.

I think everyone reading this will inevitably have a question: Why are the moon's rotation and revolution periods exactly equal? Is it just a coincidence that things in the world are born this way, or is there a natural reason that forces the rotation period to become consistent with the revolution period? From studying astronomical observation records of the past few centuries, we can now assert that the Earth's rotation speed is gradually slowing down. The reason for this lengthening of the Earth's rotation period is mainly due to the friction of ocean tides. We can imagine that when the moon had not yet solidified, the tidal forces that the Earth's gravity caused on the moon were far greater than the ocean tides that the moon caused on Earth. If the moon's rotation period was initially shorter than its revolution period, the effect of this tidal force would slow down the moon's rotation speed until the rotation period lengthened to be equal to the revolution period. At this point, the Earth's tidal force on the moon would not further slow down its rotation. Therefore, it remains in the situation where the moon's rotation and revolution periods are exactly equal, as they are now.

The Moon's Birth and Evolution

There are many theories about the moon's birth and evolution. But due to the remoteness of the era and our lack of sufficient observation data, it is very difficult to judge which one is correct and which one is wrong. They can each explain some phenomena, but they also contradict other facts. Some theories believe that the moon was separated from the Earth's body, just like Laplace's nebular hypothesis about the solar system, which believes that all planets were separated from the Sun's body. Others have mystified the theory, believing that because the Earth separated a piece of its body's material to form the moon, it created the large depression of the Pacific Ocean. According to his calculations, the volume of the Pacific Ocean is approximately equal to the volume of the moon. Another theory asserts that the moon is a celestial body that was captured by the Earth's gravity.

The most striking phenomenon on the moon's surface under a telescope is the many cirque mountains. Due to their shape, similar to volcanoes on Earth, some people believe that they were formed by volcanic eruptions on the moon. Some say that the cirque mountains on the moon are different from volcanoes on Earth. They are produced by the impact of meteorites. The Earth's atmosphere provides protection, so the impact of meteorites on it is relatively small. Due to geological weathering, even if there were cirque mountains on the Earth originally, they would disappear after some time. This explains why the moon has so many cirque mountains, while the Earth does not.

In addition to the cirque mountains, there are also some large, darker plains on the moon's surface, which are traditionally called seas. We can be sure that there is no water in these so-called seas. Everyone has seen the setting sun reflected by the lake, how dazzling it is. If there were real seas on the moon's surface, they would sometimes reflect sunlight back to the Earth. At that time, these dark areas would show golden rays of light. But we have not encountered this phenomenon. Therefore, we conclude that the areas called seas are actually just large plains.

The Scientific Significance of Observing the Far Side of the Moon

The main basis for studying the moon's birth and evolution is the observation of the moon. Originally, the observation data we had mastered was only limited to the visible side of the moon. The automatic interplanetary station provides us with photos of the far side of the moon, which doubles this observation data at once, adding a new batch of information to the solution of the evolution problem. Moreover, the information from the far side of the moon has special significance. Because the natural conditions of the far side of the moon and its visible side are significantly different. For example, the Earth's shadow can sometimes block the visible side of the moon, forming what we call a lunar eclipse. From the moon's point of view, this phenomenon is a solar eclipse, because at this time the Earth is blocking its sun. Now we will generally compare the Earth's solar eclipse and the moon's solar eclipse. Any place on the Earth's surface has the opportunity to see a solar eclipse. Only the visible side of the moon will encounter a solar eclipse, and its far side will never have a solar eclipse. The reason is very simple. Because the Earth is always on the visible side of the moon, naturally it will only block the sun on the visible side. The duration of a total solar eclipse seen on Earth is only a few minutes at most, while the total solar eclipse encountered on the moon's surface can last for several hours. The temperature we measured from noon to midnight on the moon can drop from +120°C to -140°C. This is because the moon does not have the protection of an atmosphere, and its day and night lengths are each equivalent to our fifteen days. When we encounter a total solar eclipse on Earth, we will suddenly feel a gloomy, chilling atmosphere. It is conceivable that there will be very drastic temperature changes on the moon during a total solar eclipse, even causing cracks in the moon's surface rocks. But the far side of the moon is not affected by this. Therefore, the observation of the far side of the moon not only increases the data obtained from the visible side, but also has its special importance.

This is only considering the significance of the successful photography of the far side of the moon by the automatic interplanetary station from the narrow perspective of an astronomical worker. Generally speaking, we know that every launch of a Soviet cosmic rocket marks a big step forward for mankind in conquering outer space. According to this rate of development, what the President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Nesmeyanov, said, that modern youth can see humans landing on the moon, Mars, and Venus, can be considered a very confident prediction. When the day comes when interstellar travel is realized, astronomers' research on the moon, Mars, and Venus may have to begin to give way, and they will be classified into the research scope of meteorology, geology, and biology. This may be considered a small loss for astronomers. But it is a great gain for mankind's conquest of the universe. At that time, traveling in the vast lunar palace will be a vacation program for people, without having to rely on ethereal immortals.

    闲话月球
    中国科学院紫金山天文台台长　张钰哲
    今年10月4日我们的伟大友邦苏联发射的第三个宇宙火箭，也就是自动行星际站，把人世从来无缘识面的月球背面照片，用电视技术传送到地面上来。我们在歌颂惊叹苏联科学技术的成就和征服宇宙空间事业突飞猛进的同时，也就很自然的产生了对于天边月亮的无穷兴趣。
    月球的自转和公转
    对于月球自转的现象，很多人觉得不易理会。他们说如果月球在那里自转，应该是它的面面都可以看到，为什么我们永远只能看到月亮的一面呢？我想这应该看成为一个立场、观点的问题。我指的是物理上的立场、观点，而不是政治上的立场、观点。你站在地球上来看天安门，你自然说天安门老是坐北朝南，没有任何转动。假若你翻个孙悟空的跟斗云，到半天空中来看天安门，你会发觉天安门所对着的天上黄道十二宫的星座，是时常在改变，从双子座到金牛座到白羊座到双鱼座……依次轮流下去，经过二十四小时便周而复始。显然，天安门是在那里转动着。现在月球的情况，也就和天安门有些类似。你从地球望去，会看到月球老是以固定的一面对着你，所以你觉得它没有转动。不过你若从半天空看去，月球某一方所面对的星座，也是经常地在那里改变。所不同之处，就是它比天安门转动得慢，需要二十七八天才又周而复始。
    现在月球是以271／3日的时间围绕着地球公转一周。月球自转一周的时间，如果比这个日数更少或者更多，换句话说，就是如果月球自转的情况比实际更快些或者更慢些，我们地球上的人们仍然可有机会把月球的面面都看到。偏偏月球自转的周期和它绕地球公转的周期，刚好相等。这就使着月亮终古以一面对着地球，使着人们一直无从窥见月球背面的秘密。假使这里所讲的一套还没把道理说清楚，我愿意再作一个浅显的譬喻。农村中有一种牲口推磨式的水车。它由一只直径约两米平放着的木制齿轮构成。把牛套上去，走动起来，就使齿轮绕着垂直轴而旋转。轮齿拨动了机械，把水打到田地里来。如果赶牛的牧童坐在大齿轮的中央，那么当牛在推动水车不断地环绕着走动的时候，牧童老是只能看到牛身子的某一边。姑且说牛是循时针的方向绕转。当牛在北方时，它的头是向东，牛到东时头向南，牛到南时头向西，牛到西时头向北，回到北边，牛头也恢复了东向的位置。牛头从向东回到向东，可以说是它自转一周。在这相同的时间内，牛从齿轮的北方又走回到齿轮的北方，可算是绕着牧童公转了一周。由于这公转和自转期间，恰好相等，所以牧童也只是老看到牛身的一面。如果细心体会一下牛推水车的情况，那么对于月球自转公转的问题，便也不难豁然通朗。
    我想大家读到这里，不免要发生疑问：月球自转和它的公转的周期为什么会恰好相等呢？难道天下事生成就会这样的巧合，或者其中有自然的道理，逼着自转的周期不得不变得同公转周期相一致？从研究数百年来的天文观测记录来看，我们现在能够断言，地球的自转速度，是逐渐弛缓下来的。这个地球自转周期变长的原因，主要是起于海洋潮汐的摩擦作用。我们可以设想当月球还不曾凝固的年代，地球吸力使月球产生的潮汐，远大于月球在地上所引起海洋的潮汐。如果当初月球的自转周期短于它的公转周期，这个潮汐的作用，就会使月球自转的速度放慢，直至自转周期加长到和公转周期相等而后已。至此，地球对于月球的生潮力就不会使它的自转进一步放慢。因此就停留在像现在月球的自转和公转周期恰好相等的情况。
    月球的诞生和演化
    关于月球的诞生和演化过程，有许多种的说法。但是由于年代的荒远和我们缺乏充分的观测资料，很不容易判断，哪一个是正确的，哪一个是错误的。他们各能说明某些现象，但和另外一些事实又有矛盾。有的学说认为月球是从地球本体分出去的，就如同拉普拉司关于太阳系的星云假说，认为所有行星，都是从太阳本体分离出来一样。还有人故神其说，认为地球因为分出一块本体的物质，去构成月球，所以产生了太平洋这部分的大坑谷。按他的计算，太平洋的容积和月球的体积，是差不多相等的。另一种说法，就断定月球是被地球吸力所俘获来的一个星体。
    在望远镜下月亮表面最令人注目的现象，是那许多寰形山。由于它的形状，类似地球上的火山口，有人就认为它是由于月球上火山爆发所形成的。有人说月球上的寰形山不同于地球上的火山。它们是受了流星陨石的冲击而产生的。地球因为有空气层的保护，流星陨石对它的冲击力比较小。由于地质上的风化作用，纵使地上原先也有寰形山，过了一些年代之后，便会荡然无存。借此说明为什么月球有许多寰形山，而地球上却没有。
    月面上显著的目标，除了寰形山而外，还有一些颜色较暗的大平原，按旧习惯都把它称作海洋。我们可以确定这些所谓海洋里面，并没有水。大家都见过湖面反照的落日，是何等光芒夺目。月面若有真的海洋，有时一定也会把太阳光反映到地球上来。那时这暗黑地区，将要显出金光万道。但是我们没有遇见这种现象。因此我们得出的结论是，那些被称作海洋的区域，实在只是一片大平原。
    月背观察的科学意义
    研究月球的诞生和演化，主要的依据，就是对月亮的观测。原先我们所掌握观测的数据，只局限于月球可见的这一面。自动行星际站供给我们以月球背影的照片，使这种观测数据，陡然增加了一倍，给演化问题的解决增添了一批新资料。而且月球背面的资料，还具有特殊的意义。因为月球的背面和它的可见面的自然条件，有一些显著的不同。譬如地球的影子，有时能够遮蔽月球的可见面，形成我们所谓的月食。从月球的观点来看，这现象就是日食，因为这时地球把它的太阳遮住了。现在我们将地球的日食和月球的日食，概括地作一个比较。地球表面任何一处，都有看到日食的机会。月球只有可见面这一边，会遇见日食，而它的背面，从来不会有日食的。理由是非常的简单。因为地球总是处于月球可见面这一边，自然它也就只会遮住可见面的太阳。地球上所看到日全食时间的延长，顶多才几分钟，而月面所遇到的日全食，可以延长到几小时。我们测量所得月球正午地区到半夜地区的温度，可以从摄氏正120°降到负140°。这是因为月球没有大气层的掩护，而且它的昼夜的长度，各相当于我们十五天的时间。我们在地球上遇到日全食的时候，都会骤然感到一股阴森袭人的寒气。可以想像得到月面上日全食的时候，一定会有很剧烈的温度变化，甚至于使月面岩石，发生裂痕。但是月球背面，便
  不受这种影响。所以月球背面的观测，不仅是加多了从可见面所获得的数据，而实在具有它的特殊重要意义。
    这只是从狭隘的天文工作者的观点，来考虑自动行星际站拍摄月球背影成功的意义。大而言之，我们知道每一次苏联宇宙火箭的发射，都标志着人类在征服宇宙空间的里程上迈进了一大步。按着这个发展的速度看来，苏联科学院院长?斯米扬诺夫所说的，现代青年可以看到人类在月球火星金星着陆的话，可认为是很有把握的预言。等到星际旅行实现的那一天，天文学者对于月球火星金星的研究，恐怕将要开始割爱，而把它们划到测量气象地质生物各门的研究范畴里面。这对于天文学者来讲，或者可以算作一个小损失。但对人类征服宇宙来说则是一个大收获。那时遨游广寒宫殿，将是人们假期旅行的节目，而无需寄托于虚无缥缈的神仙了。
