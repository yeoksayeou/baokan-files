Constantly Relying on the Masses, Doing Everything by Relying on the Masses
Wangyazhuang Party Branch Works Steadily
Every member of the Wangyazhuang Party Branch has a fixed connection with the masses. The branch also convenes mass meetings once or twice a month as needed to solicit opinions from the commune members on various tasks. In every task, especially in production technology innovation, the Party branch can boldly promote democracy and carry out free discussion and debate.

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Wangyazhuang Party Branch of the Communist Party of China in Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, has consistently adhered to putting politics in command and following the mass line, promoting the continuous advancement of various tasks. In the past ten years, grain production here has increased by 1.78 times, and cotton production has increased by 1.35 times. The masses in the whole village have escaped the poverty and misery of the old society and embarked on a happy and prosperous life.

    The Wangyazhuang Party Branch has always maintained the closest ties with the masses. All Party members have fixed connections with commune members and often visit them at their homes. The branch also convenes mass meetings of various kinds once or twice a month as needed, specifically to solicit everyone's opinions on various tasks. In this way, the branch can always maintain a clear head, work steadily in various movements, and move forward smoothly.

    The Wangyazhuang Party Branch also pays great attention to summarizing the experiences of the masses to promote work. The area is located on a plateau and is a water-deficient area. In order to solve the difficulties of drinking water and water use for the masses, they summarized the experience of farmer Li Dianzhao in digging wells for irrigation and vigorously publicized it among the masses. At the same time, with Party members and cadres as the backbone, they successively dug thirty-four wells in the fields, setting an example for the masses. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Party branch proposed the slogan "Dig wells to prevent drought and turn the plateau into paddy fields," which quickly set off a wave of well digging. In just four months, the whole village dug 244 wells, realizing irrigation of dry land, which provided an important condition for last year's extraordinary harvest.

    In every task, especially in production technology innovation, the Party branch can boldly promote democracy and carry out free discussion and debate. This not only educated the masses well, but also found the right way to deal with work problems. When planting wheat last year, the masses had different views on close planting. Some advocated sowing 30 jin of seeds per mu, while others advocated only 10 jin. In response to this situation, the Party branch convened a meeting of young people, old people, and people with experience in using seed drills. After an exchange of ideas, the conclusion was: only by implementing rational close planting can production be increased. As for how many seeds to sow per mu, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions according to the specific situation. The branch put forward specific requirements for rational close planting, ensuring a bumper wheat harvest this year. For example, a piece of wheat on the Houya of the Third Team, sown with 40 jin of seeds per mu, had a yield increase of 64% compared to last year.

    Promoting the enthusiasm of the masses through labor emulation campaigns and "Three Loves Days" has been the leadership method that the Wangyazhuang Party Branch has adhered to for seven years. Whenever a work task is put forward, the branch mobilizes commune members to revise public pledges household by household, and everyone makes an action plan. Based on the targets proposed in these pledges and plans, they organize everyone to carry out opponent competitions between teams, groups, and individuals. In each competition, the Party branch must put forward loud and motivating slogans based on the central task and goals, and conduct timely inspections and regular evaluations. They carry out evaluation summaries at the "Three Loves Day" meetings, commend the advanced, and promote the backward; in the daily competition, they use the spirit of "Three Loves Days" as a driving force to carry out criticism and self-criticism at any time. Because these measures are effective, the work of Wangyazhuang is lively and colorful. The water conservancy project was originally planned to be completed in three years, but it was completed in just over a year. All thirty-four Party members in the branch play an exemplary role in their work, and are deeply supported and loved by the masses. 70% of the Party members have been rated by the masses as models in various tasks.

    时时依靠群众事事依靠群众
    王亚庄党支部脚跟着实
    王亚庄党支部的每个党员，都和群众有着固定的联系。支部还根据需要，每月召开一两次群众座谈会，征求社员对各项工作的意见。在每项工作中，特别是在生产技术革新中，党支部都能放手发扬民主，开展鸣放辩论。
    本报讯　中共山西省万荣县王亚庄党支部，一贯坚持政治挂帅和群众路线，推动了各项工作不断前进。在过去十年中，这里的粮食产量提高了一点七八倍，棉花产量提高了一点三五倍。全村群众已摆脱了旧社会那种贫困、悲惨的日子，走上了欢乐、幸福的生活道路。
    王亚庄党支部，始终同群众保持着最密切的联系。全体党员都和社员有着固定的联系，经常到社员家访问。支部还根据需要，每月召开一两次各类群众的座谈会，专门征求大家对各项工作的意见。这样，就使得支部经常保持清醒的头脑，在各项运动中脚跟着实，顺利前进。
    王亚庄党支部也很注意总结群众的经验，推动工作。这里地处高原，是个缺水的地方。为了解决群众吃水、用水的困难，他们便总结了农民李殿钊打井浇地的经验，在群众中大力进行宣传。同时，还以党员、干部为骨干，先后在地里打了三十四眼井，给群众做出榜样。1958年大跃进中，党支部又提出“打井防干旱，高原变水田”的口号，迅速地掀起了打井的热潮。仅仅四个月的时间，全村就打了二百四十四眼井，实现了旱地水利化，给去年的特大丰收提供了重要条件。
    在每项工作中，特别是在生产技术革新中，党支部都能放手发扬民主，开展鸣放辩论。这不仅很好地教育了群众，而且也找到了正确处理工作问题的方法。去年种小麦时，群众对密植提出了不同的看法，有的主张每亩下籽三十斤，有的则主张只下十斤。针对这一情况，党支部便召集青年、老年和有摇耧技术的人，举行了座谈会。经过思想交锋，得出的结论是：只有实行合理密植才能增产，至于每亩地下籽多少，则要根据具体情况因地制宜。支部提出了合理密植的具体要求，保证了今年小麦的丰收。像三队后崖上的一块小麦，每亩下籽四十斤，产量比去年提高了64％。
    通过开展劳动竞赛和“三爱日”，来鼓足群众的干劲，这已是王亚庄党支部坚持七年的领导方法了。每当一件工作任务提出后，支部就发动社员户户修订公约，人人订出行动计划，并以这些公约、计划中所提的指标为条件，组织大家开展队与队、组与组、人与人的对手竞赛。在每次竞赛中，党支部都要根据中心工作和奋斗目标，提出响亮的鼓动口号，并且按时检查、定期评比。他们在“三爱日”会上进行评比总结，表扬先进，促进落后；在日常竞赛中又以“三爱日”的精神为动力，随时开展批评和自我批评。由于这些措施得力，便使王亚庄的工作有声有色。兴修水利的工程原计划三年完成，结果一年多就完成了。全支部三十四个党员，个个都在工作中起模范带头作用，深得群众的拥护与爱戴，有70％的党员被群众评为各项工作当中的模范。
