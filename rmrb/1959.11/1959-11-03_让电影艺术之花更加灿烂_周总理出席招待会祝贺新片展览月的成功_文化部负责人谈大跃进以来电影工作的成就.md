Just like the art of drama, the art of film is one of the most splendid flowers blossoming in the entire Great Leap Forward. Through the films in this film exhibition month, we can see that, like other arts, many new forces have emerged in film. In the future, we should continue to absorb more new forces from other literary and art teams and from amateur art lovers, expand the ranks of film workers, and continue to create more films with higher ideological and artistic quality.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd — The Ministry of Culture and the China Film Workers Association held a banquet tonight at the Beijing Hotel to entertain film workers in Beijing and from various places in Beijing, as well as relevant people in the literary and art circles, to celebrate the success of the 1959 National New Film Exhibition Month.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Zhou Yang, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Xiao Hua, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China Chen Kehan, and others attended the banquet.

Shen Yanbing, Qian Junrui, Xia Yan, Lin Mohan, Cai Chusheng, and others from the Ministry of Culture and the China Film Workers Association attended the banquet. Also attending the banquet were heads of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and associations of writers, playwrights, musicians, and artists.

Premier Zhou spoke at the meeting. He raised a toast to congratulate the achievements of China's film industry over the past ten years—especially since the Great Leap Forward. He said: Just like the art of drama, the art of film is one of the most splendid flowers blossoming in the entire Great Leap Forward. He said, of course, we must never be satisfied with the achievements we have already made, but must strive for greater achievements on the basis of past achievements. He emphasized: Through the films in this film exhibition month, we can see that, like other arts, many new forces have emerged in film. In the future, we should continue to absorb more new forces from other literary and art teams and from amateur art lovers, expand the ranks of film workers, and continue to create more films with higher ideological and artistic quality to welcome the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Party and the 20th anniversary of the founding of the country.

Representatives from various film studios expressed at the meeting that they would continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost enthusiasm under the leadership of the Party, and contribute their greatest strength to the prosperity of the people's film art.

The film workers in Beijing who were invited to the banquet included screenwriters, directors, actors, cinematographers, sound recordists, as well as art, printing, editing, special effects, technical research, distribution, projection, and administrative staff from the Beijing Film Studio, "August First" Film Studio, Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, Beijing Film Printing Factory, China Film Distribution and Projection Corporation, China Film Archive, Beijing Film Subtitle Factory, China Film Science and Technology Research Institute, Beijing Film Academy, Beijing Municipal Distribution and Projection Corporation, and other units. Opera and drama actors from Yunnan Province who participated in the filming of "Five Golden Flowers" at the Changchun Film Studio, the main actors from the Central Experimental Opera House who participated in the filming of "Lotus Lantern" at the Shanghai Tianma Film Studio, as well as representatives of the Heroes' Congress, national model worker Huang Baomei, who starred in the film "Huang Baomei," and special invited film worker representatives to the Heroes' Congress, Cui Wei, Wan Chaozhen, Xu Xiaobing, Zhang Hongquan, and others, also attended the reception banquet. An evening party was also held after the banquet.

This newspaper reports that the Central Ministry of Culture held a press conference at the end of October, introducing the situation of the National New Film Exhibition Month celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the country, and emphasized that through this new film exhibition, it can be seen that the national film workers have actively implemented the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and have achieved great success.

The spokesperson pointed out that under the shining light of the Party's general line, film workers across the country, going all out, aiming high, and resolutely implementing the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and socialist construction through film art, have enabled the film industry to achieve unprecedented development. First of all, since the Great Leap Forward, the ideological and artistic qualities of China's film art have been significantly improved. The new films exhibited this time have a very wide range of themes and diverse forms, truly reflecting the heroic deeds and heroic figures of the Chinese people in revolutionary struggles and socialist construction, and have infected and educated the broad masses of the audience with the spirit of socialism and communism. Secondly, this exhibition proves that the output of our films has greatly increased in the past one or two years. Last year and this year, we have shot a total of more than 180 feature films, exceeding the total output of feature films in the eight years from 1949 to 1957. At the same time, this year, in order to pay tribute to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the country, a large number of color feature films were shot. All the 18 feature films presented for the National Day this time are color films. It is expected that more than 30 color feature films will be shot this year, while from 1953 to 1957, we only shot a total of 29 color feature films; Thirdly, the production time of films has been greatly shortened. In the past, it took an average of about seven to nine months to shoot a color feature film, while the films exhibited this time generally only took four to five months. For example, "Sea Eagle" started filming in April, "Nie Er" and "Oasis Song of Triumph" started filming in May, and "Five Golden Flowers" started filming in July. According to the normal routine, it would not have been possible to complete them on schedule, but thanks to the enthusiasm of the creative staff and the strong support from all sides, the tasks were finally completed ahead of schedule. Fourthly, due to the film workers' adherence to the principle of running the cause diligently and frugally, the cost of films has also been greatly reduced. For example, "Song of Youth" is a key film, large in scale, with many mass scenes, and the film length is equivalent to two films, but it only took seven months to shoot, and the production cost is only equivalent to the production cost of a color film in the past. In addition, documentary films, science and education films, and art films have also made great progress in this new film exhibition. For example, "Heroes Conquer the Great Northern Wilderness," "The Tenth Spring," "Chinese Ape-Man," "The Little Carp," etc., have all been welcomed by the broad masses of the audience.

The spokesperson also pointed out that it can be seen from this film exhibition that many new people have emerged in the film art industry. For example, the scripts of "Steel Family," "Old Soldier's New Biography," "Five Golden Flowers," "Oasis Song of Triumph," "Hui People's Detachment," "Sea Eagle," and "Good Children" are all created by young amateur writers. "Ice Sisters," "Young People in Our Village," "Lotus Lantern," "Sea Eagle" and other films are all works by young directors. In many tribute films, many new young actors played the main roles. For example, in "Oasis Song of Triumph," all the roles except for a minor role are played by young Uygur actors. The main actors in "Five Golden Flowers," "Ice Sisters" and "Song of Youth" also appeared on the screen for the first time and achieved gratifying results. In the exhibited films, more than a dozen cinematographers were shooting color films for the first time, and they quickly mastered the technology and skills of color films. In addition, we have also shot three color widescreen stereophonic feature films. At present, we have also begun to use domestic cameras and projectors to trial-produce panoramic films and stereoscopic films. These facts all show that new forces in our film industry are growing rapidly.

The person in charge also pointed out that in order to meet the requirements of the broad masses of the audience, comrades in the film printing departments and distribution and projection departments across the country have been working from morning till late at night in many cinemas. Thanks to their efforts, the quality of projection has been guaranteed and the effect of the film exhibition has been expanded.

The person in charge finally pointed out that the great achievements of this film exhibition are mainly due to the fact that under the leadership of the Party, the Party's general line of building socialism was conscientiously implemented in the film industry, politics was put in command, the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" was implemented, and at the same time, it was the timely guidance and cordial concern of the Party Central Committee and the Party committees at all levels, the great assistance of the broad masses and literary and art comrades, and the result of the concerted efforts of all film workers on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, going all out and continuing to leap forward.

This new film exhibition month is a gift from film workers to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the country, and it is also a comprehensive review of film work. The person in charge of the Ministry of Culture finally stated that all film workers have the confidence and determination to be modest and prudent on the basis of the achievements they have made, continue to work hard, strive for greater leaps forward, create more and better works, and strive to present more abundant gifts to the 40th anniversary of the Party's birth in 1961.

    新华社2日讯　文化部、中国电影工作者联谊会今晚在北京饭店举行宴会，招待北京的和各地在京的电影工作者、文艺界有关人士，庆贺1959年国产新片展览月的成功。
    周恩来总理、习仲勋副总理、中共中央宣传部副部长周扬、中国人民解放军总政治部副主任萧华、中共北京市委书记处书记陈克寒等出席了宴会。
    文化部和中国电影工作者联谊会出席宴会的，有沈雁冰、钱俊瑞、夏衍、林默涵、蔡楚生等。出席宴会的，还有全国文学艺术界联合会及作家、剧作家、音乐家、美术家等协会的负责人。
    周总理在会上讲了话。他为中国电影事业十年来——特别是在大跃进以来的成就举杯祝贺。他说：和戏剧艺术一样，电影艺术事业也是整个大跃进中的一朵开得最灿烂的鲜花。他说，当然我们决不能满足于已有的成绩，而要在过去的成绩基础上，争取更大的成就。他强调指出：通过这次电影展览月的影片，可以看到电影和其他艺术一样，涌现了许多新生力量。今后应当继续不断从其他文艺队伍中、从业余文艺爱好者中，吸收更多的新生力量，扩大电影工作者的队伍，继续创造更多的思想性艺术性更高的影片，迎接党的成立四十周年，迎接建国二十周年。
    各电影制片厂的代表都在会上表示，要在党的领导下，继续反右倾、鼓干劲，为人民的电影艺术事业的繁荣贡献出最大的力量。
    宴会招待的在京电影工作者有：北京电影制片厂、“八一”电影制片厂、中央新闻纪录电影制片厂、北京电影洗印厂、中国电影发行放映公司、中国电影资料馆、北京电影字幕工场、中国电影科学技术研究所、北京电影学院、北京市发行放映公司等单位的编剧、导演、演员、摄影师、录音师以及美术、洗印、剪辑、特技、技术研究、发行、放映、行政等方面工作人员。参加长春电影制片厂拍摄“五朵金花”的云南省的歌剧和话剧演员、中央实验歌剧院参加上海天马电影制片厂拍摄“宝莲灯”影片的主要演员，以及群英大会代表、主演“黄宝妹”影片的全国劳动模范黄宝妹，群英大会特邀电影工作者代表崔嵬、万超尘、徐肖冰、张洪权等，也出席了招待宴会。宴会结束后还举行了联欢晚会。
    本报讯　中央文化部在10月底举行了记者招待会，会上介绍了庆祝建国十周年国产新片展览月的情况，着重指出，通过这次新片展览，可以看出全国电影工作者，积极执行了党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，获得了很大的成就。
    发言人指出，在党的总路线光辉照耀下，全国电影工作者鼓足干劲，力争上游，坚决执行了电影艺术为工农兵、为社会主义建设服务的方针，使电影事业获得了空前的发展。首先是大跃进以来，我国电影艺术的思想性和艺术性都有了显著的提高。这次展出的新片，题材十分广泛，形式多样，真实地反映了中国人民在革命斗争和社会主义建设中的各种英勇事迹和英雄人物，用社会主义、共产主义精神感染和教育了广大观众。其次，这次展览证明，我国影片产量在一两年内已经有了很大的增加，去年和今年我们约共拍摄一百八十余部故事片，超过1949年至1957年八年中故事片产量的总和。同时，今年为了向建国十周年献礼，拍摄了大量的彩色故事片。这次展出的十八部国庆献礼故事片，全部是彩色片，今年预计拍摄彩色故事片三十部以上，而自1953年至1957年我们一共才拍摄了二十九部彩色故事片；第三，影片的摄制时间大大缩短了，过去拍摄一部彩色故事片，平均约需七至九个月，而这次展出的影片，一般都只有四至五个月，例如，“海鹰”4月开拍，“聂耳”、“绿州凯歌”5月开拍，“五朵金花”7月开拍，如果按照常规，都不可能按期完成，但由于创作人员鼓足干劲和各方面的有力支持，终于都提前完成任务。第四，由于电影工作者坚持了勤俭办事业的制片方针，影片成本也大大降低，例如“青春之歌”是一部重点片，规模大，群众场面多，影片长度相当两部影片，但仅拍摄了七个月的时间，而制片费用只相当于过去一部彩色影片的摄制成本。此外，这次新片展览中，纪录片、科教片、美术片等方面，也获得了很大的进步，其中如“英雄战胜北大荒”、“第十个春天”、“中国猿人”、“渔童”……等等，都得到广大观众的欢迎。
    发言人还指出，从这次影展中可以看出，电影艺术事业中涌现出了许多新人，例如，“钢铁世家”、“老兵新传”、“五朵金花”、“绿州凯歌”、“回民支队”、“海鹰”、“好孩子”等影片的剧本都是青年业余作家创作的，“冰上姐妹”、“我们村里的年轻人”、“宝莲灯”、“海鹰”等片都是青年导演的作品。在许多献礼片中，不少新的青年演员担任了主要角色。例如，“绿州凯歌”除一个次要角色外，全部角色都是维族青年演员扮演，“五朵金花”、“冰上姐妹”及“青春之歌”的主要演员，也都是第一次在银幕上出现，并且获得可喜的成绩。在展出的影片中，有十几位摄影师，是第一次拍摄彩色影片，他们迅速地掌握了彩色片的技术与技巧。另外，我们还拍摄了三部彩色宽银幕立体声故事片。目前，我们并已开始用国产的摄影机、放映机，试制全景电影和立体电影，这些事实，都说明了我们的电影事业新生力量正在迅速成长。
    负责人还指出，电影洗印部门和全国各地发行、放映等部门的同志，为了满足广大观众的要求，许多影院都是从清晨一直工作到深夜，由于他们的努力，保证了放映质量，扩大了影展效果。
    负责人最后指出，这次影展获得巨大的成就，主要是由于在党的领导下，电影事业中认真地执行了党的建设社会主义总路线，坚持了政治挂帅，贯彻了“百花齐放”的方针，同时也是党中央和各地党委的及时指导和亲切关怀，广大群众和文艺界同志的巨大援助，全体电影工作者在1958年大跃进的基础上，鼓足干劲，继续跃进的结果。
    这次新片展览月，是电影工作者向建国十周年的献礼，也是电影工作的全面大检阅。文化部负责人最后表示，全体电影工作者有信心、有决心在已取得的成就的基础上，戒骄戒躁，继续努力，争取更大的跃进，创作出更多更好的作品，为1961年向党的诞生四十周年献出更丰富的礼品而奋斗。
