Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: Liaoning Province has actively mobilized women and children to glean grain during the autumn harvest, achieving great results. The number of people participating in grain gleaning reached a peak of over 1.7 million per day. By the end of October, over 47.33 million jin of grain had been gleaned, enough to feed over 98,600 people for a year, based on an average consumption of 480 jin per person per year.

This year, people's communes in various locations actively responded to the call of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China for "clean fields, clean yards, clean roads, and clean stalks," generally achieving meticulous harvesting, threshing, and gleaning to ensure that every grain is stored. In Yi County, commune members universally gleaned the 584,000+ mu of harvested land three times, recovering over 829,000 jin of grain. In order to achieve a bumper harvest, the urban area of Anshan mobilized over 80,000 women and students to glean over 11 million jin of grain.

The masses in many places also vigorously unearthed underground grain. In six counties, including Tieling, Liaozhong, Kaiyuan, and Xinmin, over 300,200 jin of grain were dug out from rat holes, and over 67,000 field rats were killed, increasing grain yields and eliminating pests.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun: Farmers in Jilin Province are conducting a movement to pick up grain plot by plot and row by row in the harvested autumn fields, truly achieving a bumper harvest and ensuring that no grain is lost. According to statistics up to October 15, over 13.3 million jin of grain have been gleaned.

Various localities have adopted methods such as holding on-site meetings and calculating detailed accounts to mobilize the masses to glean grain. The Taiping Management Area of the Kalun People's Commune in Jiutai County held an on-site grain-gleaning meeting. Participants personally gleaned 30 jin of millet from two mu of millet fields and 20 jin of soybeans from one mu of soybean fields. Based on this figure, it was estimated that a universal gleaning of millet and soybeans throughout the management area could increase grain yield by more than 100,000 jin, enough to feed 2,000 people in the entire management area for 84 days. Under the comprehensive arrangement of the people's communes, various places generally organized grain-gleaning teams composed of the elderly, weak laborers, and children. In Baicheng, Liuhe, Panshi, Jiutai, Dongfeng, and other counties and cities, over 500,000 jin of grain have been gleaned under the slogan of "no blade of grass shall be abandoned, and no grain shall be lost." Many commune members go to the fields carrying baskets, harvesting crops while gleaning grain. The Wanbao People's Commune in Dehui County used this method to glean over 50,000 jin of grain.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: Autumn-ripe grain crops in Hebei Province have been basically harvested. In the autumn harvest, people's communes in various places enthusiastically responded to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to harvest well, thresh well, collect well, sell well, distribute well, and store well, adopting many measures of meticulous harvesting and threshing, and achieving great results. According to statistics up to October 13, the province increased grain yield by over 40 million jin through meticulous harvesting and threshing.

In Handan Prefecture, Yongnian County had 30,000 auxiliary laborers who formed professional teams for meticulous harvesting and threshing. They adopted measures such as threshing five times in the yard, winnowing the chaff cleanly, turning over the straw cleanly, and picking up the grain cleanly in the fields, increasing the yield of 600,000 mu of grain crops by 1.9 million jin. Shicun Commune in Hejian County mobilized the masses to offer suggestions and implement eleven measures, including picking up ears, sweeping up grains, sweeping carriages, clearing stack bottoms, and sweeping the edges of the field, re-harvesting and re-threshing the 58,900 mu of harvested grain crops, increasing grain yield by a total of 268,000 jin. The northern regions, where the autumn harvest was relatively rough in previous years, also launched a meticulous harvesting and threshing movement this year, with the goal of getting every ear to the field and every grain into storage. In Qinglong County, Chengde Prefecture, through meticulous harvesting and threshing, the county's 700,000+ mu of grain crops increased grain yield by over 1.5 million jin.

Various localities also paid attention to the meticulous harvesting and picking up of sweet potatoes. In Zhuoxian County, Baoding Prefecture, each commune and team organized professional teams and transportation groups for digging potatoes, cutting vines, slicing, and picking up potatoes, based on the size of the potato harvesting task, with division of labor and responsibility, so that sweet potatoes were harvested quickly and well.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu: Farmers in various parts of Sichuan are adopting various methods, such as re-threshing rice straw and picking up fallen ears, to further reduce spillage and waste in the autumn harvest and ensure a bumper harvest. In eleven counties, including Dazhu and Youyang, over 1 million jin of rice have been harvested from re-threshing rice straw in the past few days. In the Yongshou Commune of Meishan County, after re-threshing and re-harvesting, they harvested over 1,400 jin of peanuts and 870 jin of cotton.

In the midst of the intense autumn plowing and autumn planting, people's communes in various places are rationally arranging labor, organizing some commune members to establish meticulous harvesting and inspection teams, and mobilizing women, children, and other auxiliary laborers to go to the fields and yards to carry out a second autumn harvest. In seven counties of Jiangjin Prefecture, over 77,000 Young Pioneers were mobilized to go to the fields, recovering over 470,000 jin of grain. Many communes in peanut-producing areas such as Ziyang County also combined autumn plowing with organizing members who plow the fields, sow seeds, and fertilize to pick up peanuts during work breaks.
