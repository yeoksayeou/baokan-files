    Rather Be Troubled a Thousand Times Than Cause Customers Inconvenience
    Liu Huilan Introduces Shijingpo Store's Experience in Serving Workers in Industrial and Mining Areas

    Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Liu Huilan, the representative of the Sichuan Provincial Commercial Red Banner Unit – Chongqing Shijingpo Trading Store – who attended the National Hero Conference, introduced a complete set of experiences in wholeheartedly serving as a logistics department and serving workers in industrial and mining areas at the advanced experience exchange meeting of the commercial system. Their experience has been valued by the Ministry of Commerce and all commercial representatives, and they believe it is worth promoting nationwide.

    The Shijingpo Trading Store is responsible for the supply of more than 50,000 steel workers and their families in Chongqing. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the store's employees put forward the fighting slogan of "Being a good logistics department, everything for steel," and closely relied on the factory's Party committee to continuously improve the supply work in the factory area, making the workers feel convenient everywhere. From last year to September this year, they received more than 300,000 written praise opinions, more than 300 red reports, and dozens of pennants from customers. While improving the supply work, the store's management and operation have also been continuously improved. From January to September this year, the sales volume increased by 135% compared with the same period last year, while the expenses were much lower than last year.

    In order to do a good job in the supply work in the factory area, the store created a complete set of supply methods of "more, better, longer, and more complete" according to the characteristics of the supply work in the factory area, and promoted the overall leap forward of the store's work.

    More commercial outlets, more sales agents, more temporary supply points
    1. More: more commercial outlets, more sales agents, and more temporary supply points. Wherever there is a need, there is a supply point, so that workers can buy what they need without leaving the workshop, and family members can buy what they need without leaving the village section. They increased business outlets according to needs, organized family members of workers to set up sales agents, and also dispatched salespersons from the central store to set up distribution stores on the construction site and in the concentrated areas of workers, and organized peddlers to provide mobile supplies. In addition, they also added telephone purchase services. In this way, a network of commercial outlets was formed in the factory area, which greatly facilitated the masses.

    Good commodity distribution, good service attitude, good food arrangement
    2. Good: good commodity distribution, good service attitude, and good food arrangement, so that how much is needed is supplied how much.

    In order to do a good job in the rational distribution of goods, they determined the principles of ensuring key points, taking care of special needs, giving priority to collectives, and arranging generalities. They tried every means to ensure the supply of goods needed for special operations workers such as high-temperature workshops and health canteens. When the supply of fresh goods was once insufficient, they stored a portion of goods to specially supply to lying-in women and patients. In peacetime, they adopted the methods of demarcating areas and fixing points, dividing sections and assigning responsibilities, delivering goods to homes, and distributing them to people, so that every household received their care.

    In order to distribute goods well, they often thought of various ways to achieve "six knows" and "ten familiarities." The so-called "six knows" are: knowing the population, knowing the number of households, knowing the people from the south and the north, knowing the pregnancy and delivery period of pregnant women, knowing the ethnic minorities, and knowing the families of revolutionary martyrs; the "ten familiarities" are: familiar with the orphans, the elderly, the sick, the disabled, the young, the homes with no one, the old cadres, the old workers, the old engineering and technical personnel, and the labor models. In April of this year, the reception staff of the restaurant learned that an old worker was ill and needed proper nutrition, so they continuously delivered meals to him for more than a month, which deeply moved him. Later, the old worker wrote in the diary of the receptionist: "You are more intimate than relatives and better than nurses."

    In terms of service attitude, they "treat customers like relatives." They implement commodity returns and exchanges, and sell commodities in small quantities, even a needle and a thread. They implement door-to-door delivery. The sales staff, with the spirit of "rather be troubled a thousand times than cause customers a little inconvenience," try every means to serve customers. For example, in October last year, the factory's职工医院 [Staff Hospital] received a severely burned patient whose life was in danger. Late at night, they urgently needed a nylon raincoat for insulation (there were no goods on the market at that time). In order to meet the needs and rescue the injured, the store's salesperson took a bus to the city late at night to ask door-to-door, and went through fifty or sixty stores of all sizes, searching for more than four hours, and finally bought one at a consignment store, solving the urgent need.

    In terms of arranging meals: Since the population in the factory area has increased exponentially, they have adopted three methods to comprehensively arrange the meals of workers and their families: (1) Implementing "one guarantee and three cooperations" for the factory's staff canteens, that is: the store is responsible for supplying non-staple food, and directly delivers the vegetables organized from the People's Commune to these canteens. At the same time, the state-owned restaurants operated by the store closely cooperate with the staff canteens in terms of business hours, locations, and variety of dishes. For example, when the staff canteen is not open, the restaurant operated by the store will open for supply; for certain types of dishes that the staff canteen lacks, the state-owned restaurant will try to supply them; when there are many people and it is crowded, the state-owned restaurant will set up points nearby, contract for meals, and appropriately disperse the number of people eating. …

    (2) Improving the supply methods of the restaurant and serving the workshop. The store sends people to the workshop to run a workshop restaurant, which supplies day and night, so that the night shift workers can eat something after work. This kind of workshop restaurant is very popular with the workers.

    (3) Assisting family members in running family canteens in the section area, and gradually developing it into a life service department for the families of the workers. They sent special personnel to help, so that every village section has a canteen. These family canteens are run economically and affordably. Generally, meals cost only five yuan per month, and it only costs seven or eight yuan to eat better, so family members have joined one after another. Now the number of people eating in the canteen has increased to more than 16,000.

    The method they adopted of combining large (factory collective canteens), medium (state-owned restaurants), and small (family canteens) solved the problem of eating for workers, their families, and temporary workers in a very short time.

    Long business hours, supply whenever needed
    3. Long: that is, long business hours. They have achieved supply whenever needed. In order to adapt to the characteristics of the factory's three-shift production system, the store has implemented all-day business hours. The method is that the stores that sell department stores and non-staple foods are open from morning to night for twelve hours every day. The stores that sell cigarettes, alcohol, candy, and pastries at the main intersections of the factory are open from 6:30 in the morning to 2:00 in the morning. The workshop restaurant is open during the time when workers go to and from work (until 2:00 or 3:00 in the evening), and opens four times a day. General restaurants take turns opening for business.

    Full range of goods, full range of services, everything from eating to dressing
    4. Full: that is: a full range of goods, a full range of services, so that everything is available, everything from eating to dressing is available. Due to actively organizing the source of goods by all means, the varieties operated by the store have increased from more than 7,000 in 1958 to the current 11,000. Due to the adoption of methods such as the store running its own business and organizing the masses to run it, the service items of the store have also increased to 51. Workers can solve problems such as repairing shoes, sewing clothes, washing and dyeing, taking pictures, repairing watches, repairing pens, repairing pots, repairing bowls, and even seeing doctors in this store.

    In order to better meet the needs of workers for non-staple foods, the store also adopted the policy of "self-reliance as the mainstay, striving for foreign aid as a supplement," and adopted methods such as cooperating with nearby communes to establish non-staple food bases, mobilizing family members to raise livestock, and the store running its own breeding farms, to actively develop the production of non-staple foods such as livestock and poultry. According to rough statistics so far, more than 30,000 small poultry such as chickens and ducks have been raised, with an average of more than six per household. The store itself raises more than 1,600 pigs.

    宁愿麻烦千遍　不让顾客不便
    刘惠兰介绍石井坡商店为工矿区职工服务经验
    新华社4日讯　出席全国群英大会的四川省商业红旗单位——重庆市石井坡贸易商店代表刘惠兰，在商业系统先进经验交流会上，介绍了他们全心全意当好后勤部、为工矿区职工服务的一套完整的经验，他们的经验受到商业部和全体商业代表的重视，认为值得在全国推广。
    石井坡贸易商店担负着重庆市五万多钢铁职工及家属的供应任务。1958年大跃进中，这个商店的职工提出了“当好后勤部，一切为了钢”的战斗口号，紧紧地依靠工厂党委，不断改进了厂区的供应工作。使职工处处感到方便。从去年至今年9月，他们获得顾客书面表扬意见三十多万条，红报三百多张，锦旗几十面。在改善供应工作的同时，商店经营管理也不断改善。今年1至9月份，销售额比去年同期增长135％，而费用却比去年降低很多。
    为了作好厂区的供应工作，这个商店根据厂区供应工作的特点创造了“多、好、长、全”的一整套供应办法，推动了商店工作的全面跃进。
    商业网点多，代销店多，临时供应点多
    1、多：是商业网点多、代销店多、临时供应点多，哪里有需要，哪里就有供应点，使职工不出车间、家属不出村段就可以买到需要的东西。他们根据需要增设营业点，组织工人家属设立代销点，还由中心门市部抽出营业员在工地和工人集中地点设立分销店，并组织货郎担流动供应，此外又增设了电话购货的业务。这样在厂区内就形成了星罗棋布的商业网，大大方便了群众。
    商品分配好，服务态度好，伙食安排好
    2、好：是商品分配好、服务态度好、伙食安排好，做到需要多少就供应多少。
    为了作好商品合理分配工作，他们确定了保证重点，照顾特需，优先集体，安排一般的原则，对高温车间等特种作业工人和保健食堂所需的商品，想尽办法保证供应。在鲜活商品货源一度不够充裕时，他们就储备一部分商品，专门供应产妇和病号。平时分配商品，他们则采取划片定点、分段包干、送货到家、分配到人的办法，使家家户户都受到他们的照顾。
    为了把商品分配好，他们经常想各种办法作到“六知”和“十熟”。所谓“六知”就是：知人口、知户数、知南方人北方人、知孕妇分娩期、知少数民族、知烈军属；“十熟”即是：熟悉孤、老、病、残、幼、家中无人、老干部、老工人、老工程技术人员、劳动模范。今年4月份餐厅的招待员了解到一位老工人生病，需要适当营养，就一连不间断地给他送了一个多月的菜饭，使他深受感动。后来这位老工人在这个招待员的日记上写道：“你真比亲人还亲，比护士还好。”
    在服务态度方面，他们“接待顾客犹如亲人”。他们实行商品包掉回换，商品分零，一针一线都出售。实行送货上门，售货员以“宁愿自己麻烦千遍，不让顾客稍感不便”的精神，千方百计为顾客服务。如去年10月份厂方职工医院接收一位重号火伤病人，生命危急，深夜提出急需一件尼龙雨衣作隔绝用（当时市场无货），商店售货员为了满足需要，急救伤员，深夜乘车到城内挨户询问，走遍了五六十家大小商店，寻找了四个多钟头，终于在一家委托行买到，解决了急需。
    在安排伙食方面：由于厂区人口成倍的增加，他们采取了三种办法，全面安排了工人及其家属的伙食：（1）对工厂的职工食堂实行“一包三配合”，即：商店包干供应副食品，把从人民公社组织来的蔬菜直接送到这些食堂。同时商店自己所经营的国营餐厅在营业时间、地点、菜的品种上与职工食堂密切配合。如职工食堂不开饭的时候，这个商店经营的餐厅就开门供应；职工食堂缺少的某些菜类，国营餐厅就设法供应；当人多、拥挤的时候，国营餐厅就在附近设点，包办伙食，适当分散吃饭人数。……
    （2）改进餐厅的供应办法，服务到车间。商店派人到车间举办车间餐厅，日夜供应，使夜班工人下班就能吃到东西。这种车间餐厅很受工人欢迎。
    （3）协助家属办好段区家属食堂，并逐步地使它发展成为职工家属生活服务部。他们派了专人帮助，做到每个村段都有了食堂。这些家属食堂都办得既经济、又实惠，一般伙食每月五元就够了，吃得好一些也只花七、八元钱，因此家属纷纷参加。现在在食堂搭伙的人数已经增加到一万六千多人。
    他们采取的这种大（工厂集体食堂）、中（国营餐厅）、小（家属食堂）相结合的办法，在很短时间内就解决了职工以及家属、临时工的吃饭问题。
    营业时间长，什么时候需要，什么时候供应
    3、长：即是营业时间长。他们做到了什么时候需要，什么时候供应。为了适应工厂生产三班制的特点，这个商店实行了全天营业。办法是经营百货和副食品的门市部，每天从早上到晚上营业十二小时。在工厂的几个主要路口经营烟、酒、糖果、糕点的门市，从早上六点半到深夜两点营业。车间的餐厅在工人上下班时间营业（晚上到二、三点钟），每天开门四次。一般餐厅则轮流开门营业。
    商品品种全，服务项目全，吃饭穿衣样样全
    4、全：即是：商品品种全，服务项目全，作到了要啥有啥，吃饭穿衣，样样齐全。由于千方百计积极组织货源，这个商店经营的品种，已由1958年的七千多种增加到现在的一万一千种，由于采取了商店自办和组织群众兴办等方法，这个商店的服务项目也增加到了五十一种，职工要补鞋、缝衣、洗染、照相、修表、修钢笔、补锅、补碗以至看病等都可以在这个商店解决。
    为了更好地满足职工对副食品的需要，这个商店还根据“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的方针，采取与附近公社协作建立副食品基地、发动家属饲养和商店自办饲养场等办法，积极发展家畜、家禽等副食品生产。到目前粗略统计，鸡鸭等小家禽共养了三万多只，平均每户六只多。商店自己养的猪达到了一千六百多头。
