    New Developments in Experimental Fields
    Experimental fields are an important method for improving leadership work and also an important method for carrying out mass high-yield movements. Countless facts over the past two years have proven this conclusion, and the comprehensive bumper harvest of late rice in the Kengdi Commune in Fujian is one of these examples.
    Since the Party Central Committee affirmed the method of planting experimental fields in February last year, it has quickly become widespread throughout the country. Through planting experimental fields, the leadership style of cadres has become more in-depth, leadership work has become more practical, and the relationship between cadres and the masses has become closer; through planting experimental fields, comrades leading agricultural production have further acquired agricultural production knowledge and technology, truly becoming experts in agricultural production, greatly increasing their confidence and determination to increase production. The high-yield achievements created by experimental fields have unveiled the mystery of the potential for increased land production, making people believe that land yields can still be greatly increased.
    This is the important role that experimental fields played in the first year.
    This year, the second year of implementing this method, the working methods and the role of experimental fields have undergone new developments. In many places, the area of ​​experimental fields generally accounts for about 20% of the cultivated land area, and the momentum and scale are much larger than last year; the types of experiments have not only expanded from food crops to diversified operations, but also to many tasks; experiments are not only carried out on good fields, but also on general and poor fields. What is especially important is that, although there were also some experimental fields with the nature of large-scale high-yield demonstrations last year, more of them were experimental fields with a scientific research nature; but this year is very different, in addition to experimental fields used for experimenting with agricultural science and new technologies, there are also experimental fields used to promote agricultural production increase measures and promote large-scale high yields—high-yield plots or command fields. Therefore, today's experimental fields have developed into a more complete working method and a powerful weapon for organizing the broad masses to develop agricultural production at high speed.
    Many regions have created very rich experiences in the method of planting "experimental fields." For example, the method introduced in today's newspaper, where the Kengdi Commune divides experimental fields into high-yield command fields, pacesetter fields, or high-yield zones, and closely integrates these types of experimental fields with each other, is a very good experience. Command fields are the base for leaders at all levels to guide general fields, and everything from formulating targets to promoting various production increase measures starts from the command fields. Pacesetter fields take the lead in implementing and set an example, driving the overall promotion of general fields. Various experimental fields are rationally distributed in various plots, driving general fields to form a mass movement to engage in experimental fields, promoting large-scale high yields.
    When summing up this year's bumper harvest experience, various regions should also carefully sum up the experience of engaging in experimental fields, so as to use and further develop these experiences in the practice of striving for a major agricultural bumper harvest next year, and promote the faster development of my country's agricultural production.

### 试验田的新发展

    试验田的新发展
    试验田是改进领导工作的重要方法之一，也是开展群众性丰产运动的重要方法之一。两年来无数事实证明了这个结论，福建坑底公社晚稻全面大丰收便是这些事例中的一个。
    自从党中央在去年2月肯定了种试验田这一方法以后，全国各地很快就普遍推行。通过种试验田，干部的领导作风更加深入，领导工作更加切合实际，干部和群众的关系也更加密切；通过种试验田，领导农业生产的同志进一步取得了农业生产知识和技术，真正变成农业生产的内行，大大提高了增加生产的信心和决心。试验田所创造的高产成绩，揭开了土地增产潜力的谜底，使人们相信土地的产量仍可极大地提高。
    这是试验田在第一年中所起的重要作用。
    今年，推行这一方法的第二年，试验田的工作方法和试验田的作用，都有了新的发展。很多地方，试验田的面积一般都占耕地面积的20％左右，声势和规模都比去年大得多；试验种类不仅由粮食作物扩大到多种经营，而且扩大到许多工作中；不仅在好田上搞试验，也在一般田和不好的田里搞试验。尤其重要的是，在去年虽然也有一种带有大面积高产示范性质的试验田，但更多的还是一些科学研究性质的试验田；而今年则大不相同，除了用作实验农业科学和新技术的试验田以外，更有了用作推广农业增产措施，推动大面积丰产的试验田——丰产方或指挥田。因此，现今的试验田已经发展成为一个更加完整的工作方法，也是组织广大群众高速度发展农业生产的一个有力武器。
    种“试验田”的方法，许多地区已经创造了很丰富的经验。比如今天本报介绍的坑底公社把试验田分为高产指挥田、标兵田或高产片，并且使这几种试验田密切的互相结合起来的方法，就是一个很好的经验。指挥田是各级领导干部指导一般田的基地，从制订指标到推广各种增产措施，都先从指挥田做起。标兵田则带头贯彻，作出榜样，带动一般田全面推广。各种试验田合理分布在各个地段，带动一般田形成一个群众性大搞试验田运动，促进了大面积丰产。
    各地在总结今年丰产经验的时候，对搞试验田的经验也要好好总结，以便在争取明年农业大丰收的实践中，运用和进一步发展这些经验，促进我国农业生产更快地发展。
