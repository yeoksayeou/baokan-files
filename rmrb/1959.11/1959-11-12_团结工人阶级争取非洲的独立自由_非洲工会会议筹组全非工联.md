Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 10th. The African Trade Union Conference closed here today after a six-day meeting.

The conference passed a call saying that the representatives of African trade unions support the establishment of the All-African Trade Union Federation. It said that the All-African Trade Union Federation serves the cause of African independence and freedom. It respects the autonomy of trade unions in African countries. The All-African Trade Union Federation will also strive to establish cooperation with all national and international central trade union organizations.

The conference announced that the Preparatory Committee of the All-African Trade Union Federation has been established. This committee is composed of nineteen members, including trade union representatives from Ghana, Guinea, Morocco, the United Arab Republic, Uganda, Nigeria, Algeria, Tunisia, and other African countries. The headquarters of the committee is located in Accra.

The conference said that they have decided to convene a congress of African trade unions in Casablanca, Morocco, in mid-May 1960 to formulate the details of the All-African Trade Union Federation.

The conference issued an appeal to all workers in Africa, calling on them to support the establishment of the All-African Trade Union Federation for the cause of African liberation.

In the current action program adopted by the representatives of African trade unions at this conference, it was stated that "Africa continues to be under the infamous yoke of colonialism. Colonial countries such as Belgium, Portugal, Spain, France, and Britain have established racial discrimination as a system. African markets continue to be dominated by foreign capitalism. The bloody and unjust war against the Algerian people is ongoing, and the people of Kenya, Cameroon, the Belgian Congo, Nyasaland, and Uganda are suffering from the most unenlightened and inhumane repression."

The representatives pointed out in the program that colonial rule has caused division, backwardness, poverty, and discrimination in Africa. They pledged to wage a fearless and self-sacrificing struggle for the political and economic liberation of the African continent.

The representatives said that the basic goal of the All-African Trade Union Federation is "the liberation and unification of Africa." They called on Africans to redouble their efforts to fight for African independence.

    团结工人阶级争取非洲的独立自由
    非洲工会会议筹组全非工联
    据新华社阿克拉10日电　非洲工会会议在举行了六天会议以后今天在这里闭幕。
    会议通过的一项呼吁书说，非洲工会的代表们支持成立全非工会联合会。它说，全非工会联合会是为非洲的独立和自由的事业服务的。它尊重非洲各国工会的自治。全非工会联合会还将为同一切全国性的和国际性的中央工会组织建立合作而努力。
    会议宣布，全非工会联合会筹备委员会已经建立。这个委员会是由十九名委员组成的，其中包括加纳、几内亚、摩洛哥、阿联、乌干达、尼日利亚、阿尔及利亚、突尼斯和其他非洲国家的工会代表。委员会的总部设在阿克拉。
    会议说，他们已经决定在1960年5月中旬在摩洛哥的卡萨布兰卡召开非洲各工会的代表大会，以便拟订全非工会联合会的细节。
    会议向非洲全体工人发出呼吁，要求他们为了非洲的解放事业支持建立全非工会联合会。
    非洲各工会的代表在这次会议上所通过的当前的行动纲领中说，“非洲继续处在不名誉的殖民主义的束缚之下。比利时、葡萄牙、西班牙、法国和英国这样一些殖民国家已经把种族歧视确立成为一种制度。非洲的市场继续受着外国资本主义的统治。反对阿尔及利亚人民的血腥的和非正义的战争正在进行着，怯尼亚、喀麦隆、比属刚果、尼亚萨兰和乌干达的人民正在受着最不开明的和最不人道的镇压。”
    代表们在纲领中指出，殖民统治造成了非洲的分裂、落后、贫困和歧视。他们保证将为非洲大陆的政治和经济解放进行无畏的和自我牺牲的斗争。
    代表们说，全非工会联合会的基本目标是“非洲的解放和统一”。他们号召非洲人加倍努力为非洲的独立而斗争。
