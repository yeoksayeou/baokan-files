To all commanders and fighters of the beloved Chinese People's Liberation Army:

    We, the representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers from the industrial, transportation, capital construction, and financial and trade fronts across the country, extend our highest respect to you—the defenders and builders of our motherland's socialist cause.

    Dear comrades, you are the revolutionary soldiers directly led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, you are the great warriors fighting for human happiness. You bravely guard our motherland's borders, coastlines, and airspace. In the battles to eliminate bandits and liberate coastal islands, in the struggle to severely punish the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on Jinmen and prepare to liberate Taiwan, and in the struggle to quell the rebellion of reactionary forces in Tibet, you have all held high the banner of invincibility, demonstrating unparalleled heroism and resourcefulness. You are indeed the most outstanding sons and daughters of our Chinese nation. The brilliant achievements our country has made in construction, and the increasingly happy and peaceful lives we lead, are inseparable from your heroic struggles.

    You are not only noble defenders of the motherland but also a production force in building the country. Your achievements are seen everywhere, on water conservancy construction sites, in the construction of railways and highways across the country, and on various production fronts. With selfless labor and revolutionary zeal, you have created brilliant achievements in construction. You are defenders of the cause of peace and builders of the cause of peace. You are indeed great warriors of the great Mao Zedong era.

    Dear comrades, it is the pride of our working class and the people of the whole country to have such a strong revolutionary army with a high degree of communist consciousness and wholeheartedly serving the people, under the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Thinking of you, we gain strength and confidence. Your revolutionary heroism, vigorous fighting spirit, unparalleled courage, your fine traditions of hard struggle, not fearing difficulties, and assiduously learning, your high degree of organization and discipline, have been, are, and always will be our role models. We firmly believe that with the People's Liberation Army under the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our socialist construction will be even more guaranteed.

    We are now in a great era where the East wind prevails over the West wind; "the enemy rots away day by day, while we get better day by day." However, U.S. imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, constantly violating our airspace and territorial waters, and everywhere creating tension and carrying out conspiracies to incite opposition to the People's Republic of China. Therefore, to defend our country's peaceful construction and strive for lasting world peace, we cannot relax our vigilance for a minute. While you further improve your political and military technical level and strengthen our national defense capabilities a hundredfold, we, all the staff and workers, guarantee to you that we will go all out, aim high, and not only achieve a great leap forward last year and this year, but also strive for continuous leaps forward every year in the future. We will certainly produce everything you need to build a revolutionary army with modern equipment at a faster pace. We must also strengthen our own military training and form a strong militia force of all staff and workers. If imperialism dares to invade us, we will smash their heads.

    Let us together hold high the red flag of the Party's General Line, hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and fight to consolidate national defense, liberate Taiwan, safeguard peace, and build our motherland!

    All representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers in socialist construction in the national industrial, transportation, capital construction, and financial and trade sectors

    各路英雄向解放军提出保证
    争取今后年年都跃进亲爱的中国人民解放军全体指挥员、战斗员同志们：
    我们来自全国工业、交通运输、基本建设和财贸战线上的先进集体和先进生产者的代表，向你们——我们祖国的社会主义事业的保卫者和建设者致以最崇高的敬意。
    亲爱的同志们：你们是共产党和毛主席直接领导下的革命子弟兵，你们是为人类幸福而战的伟大战士。你们英勇地守卫着我们祖国的边疆、海防和领空。在肃清残匪、解放沿海岛屿的战斗中，在严惩金门蒋匪军，准备解放台湾的斗争中，在平定西藏反动势力叛乱的斗争中，你们都高举着战无不胜的旗帜，显示了无比的英勇和机智。你们不愧是我们中华民族最优秀的儿女。我们祖国建设所取得的辉煌成就，我们过着越来越幸福的和平生活，和你们的英勇斗争是完全分不开的。
    你们不但是崇高的祖国保卫者，而且还是建设祖国的一支生产大军，在我国各地，在水利建设工地上，在全国铁路、公路的建设中，以及各个生产战线上，都留下了你们的功绩。你们以忘我的劳动，革命的干劲，在建设事业中，创造了光辉灿烂的成就。你们是和平事业的捍卫者，又是和平事业的建设者。你们不愧是伟大毛泽东时代的伟大战士。
    亲爱的同志们，我们的祖国有你们这样一支强大的具有高度共产主义觉悟的、全心全意为人民服务的革命军队，是我们工人阶级和全国人民的骄傲。一想起你们，我们就增加了力量和信心。你们的革命英雄主义精神，旺盛的战斗意志，无比的勇敢，你们艰苦奋斗，不怕困难，顽强学习的优良传统，你们高度的组织性，纪律性，过去是、现在是、今后永远是我们的学习榜样。我们完全相信，有了在中国共产党和毛主席坚强领导下的人民解放军，我们的社会主义建设就更加有了保证。
    现在我们正处于东风压倒西风的伟大时代，“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。但是，美帝国主义还侵占着我国领土台湾、澎湖、金门和马祖，不断侵犯着我国领空、领海，并且到处制造紧张局势和进行煽动反对中华人民共和国的阴谋活动。因此，为保卫我国的和平建设，为争取世界持久和平，我们一分钟也不能放松警惕。在你们进一步提高自己的政治和军事技术水平，百倍加强国防力量的同时，我们全体职工向你们保证，我们一定会鼓足干劲，力争上游，不但去年大跃进，今年大跃进，还还争取今后年年都继续跃进。我们一定生产出你们所需要的一切，来使你们以更快的速度建成一支具有现代装备的革命军队。我们也一定要加强自身的军事训练，把全体职工组成一支强大的民兵队伍。如果，帝国主义胆敢来侵犯我们，就叫他们碰得头破血流。
    让我们一起高举党的总路线的红旗，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，为巩固国防、解放台湾、维护和平、建设祖国而奋斗吧！
    全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表大会全体代表
                      1959年11月8日
