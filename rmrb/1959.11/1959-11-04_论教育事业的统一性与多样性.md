Since the issuance of the "Instructions on Educational Work" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, a full year has passed. This instruction, based on the victory of China's socialist revolution and the new situation of the leap-forward development of socialist construction, and based on the rich experience of our Party's educational work over the decades, especially since the founding of the country, in order to cultivate new people with all-round development of communism, more clearly and systematically put forward China's educational policy: education must serve proletarian politics, education must be combined with productive labor, and in order to realize this policy, education must be led by the Party. The instruction also pointed out that in order to develop education quickly, well, and economically, we must adopt the method of "walking on two legs" that combines unity and diversity, combines popularization and improvement, combines unified leadership and overall planning with local decentralization, follows the mass line, and implements education by the whole Party and the whole people in educational work.

The purpose of socialist education is to cultivate cultured laborers with socialist and communist consciousness. This unified fundamental principle throughout the country is the unity of socialist education. Under this fundamental principle, the forms of running schools are diverse, that is, state-run schools and factory, mine, and enterprise, and people's commune-run schools coexist; general education and vocational (technical) education coexist; adult education and children's education coexist; school education and self-study coexist; free education and non-free education coexist; planned cultivation of key schools and active improvement of general schools coexist; the forms of schools are also diverse, including full-time schools, half-day schools, and part-time schools. This is the diversity of socialist education.

Ensuring unity is the fundamental principle of educational undertakings, and diversity must be premised on unity. With unity, our educational undertakings have a soul, which can ensure that the training objectives of schools in different forms are consistent, and all are to cultivate cultured laborers with socialist and communist consciousness. If diversity is separated from unity, and schools in different forms do not have unified training objectives, and educational undertakings are separated from the direction of socialism and communism, our education will deteriorate. The people need education for the interests of socialism and communism. With their support, unity and diversity can be best combined, and a large number of diverse schools can be established to develop educational undertakings quickly, well, and economically. If educational undertakings are separated from the direction of socialism and communism and do not conform to the interests of the people, they will not receive the support of the people, diversity will have no vitality, and educational undertakings cannot develop.

Ensuring the problem of unity is to adhere to the Party's leadership and the socialist and communist direction in educational undertakings. The struggle on the issue of unity is essentially the struggle between the proletarian education policy and the bourgeois education policy.

Education is a superstructure, which is determined by a certain economic base and reacts to a certain economic base. In this sense, education is a tool. Different classes run education with different training objectives. In our country, the bourgeoisie certainly does not dare to directly and publicly put forward its own educational propositions. Therefore, when we put forward the policy that education should serve proletarian politics and education should be combined with productive labor, the bourgeoisie put forward the slogan of "education for education's sake" to resist. Marxist principles tell us that people need education in order to carry out class struggle and production struggle. The education of a certain class society serves the interests of the ruling class at that time; the propositions put forward by the educators of this class also always serve the interests of the ruling class at that time. Confucius, more than two thousand years ago, although he put forward the proposition of "education for all," his educational "policy" was still to teach people "literature, conduct, loyalty, and trustworthiness" and "serve the dukes and ministers" ("The Analects"). As for the class nature of bourgeois education, despite the bourgeoisie's best efforts to conceal it, it is still very obvious. Marx said that in capitalist society, education is a sign of wealth. Lenin once sharply pointed out: "The saying that education is 'non-political' or 'depoliticized' is the hypocritical attitude of the bourgeoisie, which is nothing but deceiving 99% of the masses who are ruled by the church and private ownership." The bourgeoisie's saying of "education for education's sake" is just a deceptive cover!

In 1958, Jiangsu Province, like other parts of the country, carried out an educational revolution centered on the combination of education and productive labor. While adhering to teaching, various schools ran factories and farms, teachers and students regularly went to the countryside to engage in voluntary labor, and actively participated in the movement of large-scale steelmaking. This kind of labor enthusiasm was the result of the great improvement of socialist consciousness of the majority of teachers and students after the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, and the implementation of the Party's education policy in various schools. The combination of education and productive labor broke the old tradition of intellectuals long-term despising physical labor, changed the atmosphere of the school, and made everyone take a big step towards the direction of intellectual laborization. At the same time, it also made a certain combination of book knowledge and practical knowledge, which is conducive to the consolidation and development of classroom knowledge and improves the quality of teaching. After a year of practice, we have also explored some experience in the time arrangement of labor and teaching, labor and rest. However, now some people obliterate the great gains of teachers and students after participating in labor, and exaggerate the individual phenomena of some schools that had improper time arrangements for teaching and labor and quickly overcome them, saying that we "made a mistake" last year, and that teachers and students participating in labor is "not worth the loss," and think that labor "the less the better, the best is not to do it." This is completely wrong.

It seems that the key to the problem lies in the fact that we have fundamental differences with the bourgeois educators on the concept of gain and loss. We believe that after teachers and students participate in labor, they gain a lot: they gain a correct view of physical labor, they gain the opportunity to learn the excellent qualities of the working people, they gain some production knowledge, they gain some methods of combining book knowledge with production practice, and they learn a vivid lesson in historical materialism; what is lost is the bad ideas and stinky airs of despising labor, looking down on the working people, and separating theory from practice, etc., so that we have embarked on the correct road of cultivating intellectuals who both understand politics and have culture, and who are capable of both mental and physical labor. Obviously, the struggle caused by this fundamental difference in the concept of gain and loss is the struggle between proletarian educational thought and bourgeois educational thought. Education serving proletarian politics and the combination of education and productive labor are our firm policies. We must constantly struggle against bourgeois educational thought so that the Party's educational policy can be implemented more comprehensively and more deeply.

The problem of implementing diversity is the problem of implementing the mass line and the whole set of methods of "walking on two legs" in educational work. The struggle on the issue of diversity is essentially the struggle between the two lines of running schools, the proletarian and the bourgeois. Our Party has always advocated implementing the principle of diversity in running schools. The old liberated areas actively supported the development of people-run schools and had a good tradition of following the mass line. The result of the further implementation of this principle in 1958 was the great development and great leap forward of educational undertakings in the province. However, those bourgeois educators said that the schools run by local governments, factories, mines (workshops), farms, communes, enterprises, and streets are "irregular," and half-day schools are also "irregular." What is their so-called "regularity"? That is: first, only the state is allowed to run schools, and collectives and the masses are not allowed to run schools; second, only one type of full-time school is allowed, and half-day schools are not allowed. This is an absurd proposition that completely ignores the needs of the country and the level of development of productive forces, ignores the people's learning requirements and economic conditions, and ignores the characteristics and labor conditions of rural areas. Its essence is to tie the hands of the masses, not to allow the masses to run schools, and only allow them, these "experts," to run schools; education cannot be developed quickly, well, and economically, but must be done slowly. However, the practice in 1958 proved that following the mass line and using the principle of combining unity and diversity to run schools will inevitably be lively and prosperous, and educational undertakings will greatly develop and leap forward; using the principles of bourgeois educators to run schools will inevitably be deserted and desolate, and educational undertakings will stagnate. In order to develop educational undertakings, we need a large number of educators, but they must be educators who serve proletarian politics, including a considerable number of educators who came from the old society but have embarked on the road of being both red and expert. The specialized team of educational work must be combined with the masses, and experts must be combined with the masses, so that educational undertakings can be developed quickly, well, and economically.

It seems that we have a principled disagreement with bourgeois educators on the question of what is "regular." We need regular education. At the same time, we believe that regular education starts from the level of production development and serves the development of production. According to the spirit of the General Line and the Party's mass line, the whole Party and the whole people run schools, and the forms of schools are diverse, which is the "regularity" of socialist education, because only this approach is in line with our current reality, can quickly, well, and economically improve the cultural level of the people, and promote the development of productive forces. If only the state is allowed to run schools, and collectives and the masses are not allowed to run schools, our province could not have built a set of specialized schools of engineering, agriculture, medicine, and teachers in each special zone so quickly, and most cities have a set of secondary specialized schools of engineering, agriculture, medicine, and teachers, and many people's communes have a complete set of schools of various types from kindergarten to adult, full-time to part-time, and primary school to middle school; If only full-time schools are run and half-day schools are not run, a large number of senior primary school graduates will be out of school, and it will not be possible to quickly, well, and economically train a large number of junior technicians and cadres for the communes. Therefore, following the "regularity" of bourgeois educators is detrimental to both the country and the people. What we are doing now is completely correct. The main criterion for measuring whether a school is regular or not is the quality of education. Our education, whether it is a full-time school or a half-day school, is to cultivate new people with socialist and communist consciousness, and the ability to solve practical problems, and all-round development. This is the true quality of education. In this sense, our schools are truly regular schools. Is it possible to say that those Kuomintang schools that have high-rise buildings and foreign books, but educate young people with fascism, exploitative views, hierarchical ideas, and enslavement ideas, are "regular"? Our half-day schools have the correct direction and are supported by the masses, and we are determined to run them well. Any newly created cause is always relatively rough and needs to be improved in the process of development. When agricultural middle schools were first opened, there were no classrooms, textbooks... nothing, but gradually they all had them, and they were much more complete than when they first opened. This is the example. The form of our schools is not forever unchanged. When the objective conditions change and the level of productive forces improves, our schools will be run more perfectly, and the forms of various schools will develop more in line with the requirements of productive forces and the requirements of the people at that time.

### 论教育事业的统一性与多样性

    论教育事业的统一性与多样性
    中共中央、国务院“关于教育工作的指示”发布以来，整整一年了。这个指示，根据我国社会主义革命的胜利和社会主义建设飞跃发展的新形势，根据我们党数十年来、特别是建国以来的教育工作的丰富经验，为了培养共产主义的全面发展的新人，更加明确地和系统地提出了我国的教育方针，是教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合，为了实现这个方针，教育必须由党来领导。这个指示还指出，为了多快好省地发展教育事业，在教育工作中必须采取统一性与多样性相结合、普及与提高相结合、统一领导全面规划与地方分权相结合的“两条腿走路”的办法，走群众路线，实行全党全民办学。
    社会主义教育的目的，是培养有社会主义和共产主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，这个全国统一的根本原则，就是社会主义教育的统一性。在这个根本原则下，办学的形式是多样性的，即国家办学与厂矿、企业、人民公社办学并举，普通教育与职业（技术）教育并举，成人教育与儿童教育并举，学校教育与自学并举，免费的教育与不免费的教育并举，有计划地培养重点学校与积极提高一般学校并举；学校的形式也是多种多样的，有全日制的学校，有半日制的学校和业余的学校，这就是社会主义教育的多样性。
    保证统一性是教育事业的根本原则，多样性必须以统一性为前提。有了统一性，我们的教育事业就有了灵魂，可以保证不同形式的学校的培养目标是一致的，都是为了培养有社会主义和共产主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。如果多样性离开了统一性，不同形式的学校没有统一的培养目标，教育事业离开了社会主义和共产主义的方向，我们的教育就会变质。人民群众是为了社会主义和共产主义的利益而需要教育的，在他们的支持下，统一性与多样性才能得到最好的结合，才能大量兴办多种多样的学校，使教育事业多快好省地发展起来。如果教育事业离开了社会主义和共产主义的方向，不符合人民群众的利益，就得不到人民群众的支持，多样性就没有了生命力，教育事业就不可能发展。
    保证统一性的问题，就是在教育事业中坚持党的领导、坚持社会主义和共产主义方向的问题。在统一性问题上的斗争，实质上就是无产阶级的教育方针和资产阶级的教育方针的斗争。
    教育是上层建筑，它是由一定的经济基础决定、而又反作用于一定的经济基础的，从这个意义上说，教育是工具。不同的阶级办教育，有着不同的培养目标。在我们的国家里，资产阶级当然不敢直接地公开地提出它自己的教育主张，因此当我们提出教育应当为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针的时候，资产阶级就提出“为教育而教育”的口号来对抗。马克思主义原理告诉我们，人们是为了进行阶级斗争和生产斗争而需要教育的，一定阶级社会的教育，是为当时的统治阶级的利益服务的；这个阶级的教育家提出的主张，也总是为当时的统治阶级的利益服务的。二千多年前的孔子虽然提出“有教无类”的主张，但是他的教育“方针”还是教人以“文、行、忠、信”而“事公卿”（“论语”）。至于资产阶级教育的阶级性，尽管资产阶级百般掩盖，但是仍然十分明显。马克思说过，在资本主义社会里，教育是富有财产的标志。列宁曾经尖锐地指出过：“教育‘不问政治’或‘非政治化’的说法，是资产阶级的伪善态度，这不外是对受教会和私有制统治的99％的群众的欺骗。”资产阶级“为教育而教育”的说法不过是个骗人的幌子而已！
    1958年，江苏省同全国各地一样，开展了以教育与生产劳动相结合为中心内容的教育大革命，各类学校在坚持教学的同时，学校办工厂、农场，师生定期到农村去从事义务劳动，并且积极投入大炼钢铁的运动，这种劳动热情，是广大师生经过整风运动和反右斗争，社会主义觉悟有了很大提高，各类学校贯彻了党的教育方针的结果。教育与生产劳动相结合，打破了知识分子长期轻视体力劳动的旧传统，改变了学校的风气，使大家向知识分子劳动化的方向跨了一大步。同时也使书本知识和实际知识有了一定的结合，有利于课堂知识的巩固和发展，提高了教学质量。经过一年的实践，我们在劳动与教学、劳动与休息的时间安排方面，也摸索到了一些经验。但是，现在有些人把师生参加劳动以后的巨大收获一笔抹杀，把某些学校曾经对教学与劳动的时间安排不当并且很快克服了的个别现象加以夸大，说我们去年“搞错了”，师生参加劳动是“得不偿失”，认为劳动“越少越好，不搞最好”。这是完全错误的。
    看来，问题的关键在于我们同资产阶级教育家的得失观有着根本的分歧。我们认为，师生参加劳动以后，得的很多：得到了对体力劳动的正确看法，得到了学习劳动人民优秀气质的机会，得到了某些生产知识，得到了书本知识与生产实践相结合的某些方法，上了一课活的历史唯物主义；失掉的是轻视劳动、看不起劳动人民、理论与实践脱离等等的坏思想、臭架子，使我们走上了培养既懂政治又有文化、既能脑力劳动又能体力劳动的知识分子的正确道路。很明显，由于这种得失观的根本分歧而引起的斗争，是无产阶级教育思想同资产阶级教育思想的斗争。教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合，是我们坚定不移的方针，我们必须不断地同资产阶级教育思想作斗争，使党的教育方针得到更加全面更加深入的贯彻。
    贯彻多样性的问题，就是在教育工作中贯彻群众路线和“两条腿走路”一整套办法的问题。在多样性问题上的斗争，实质上就是无产阶级和资产阶级两种办学路线的斗争。我们党历来主张在办学方面贯彻多样性的原则，老解放区就是积极支持民办学校的发展，有着走群众路线的优良传统。这个原则在1958年进一步贯彻的结果，是全省教育事业大发展、大跃进，然而那些资产阶级教育家说：地方、厂矿（车间）、农场、公社、企业、街道办的学校“不正规”，半日制的学校也“不正规”。什么是他们的所谓“正规”呢？那就是：第一，只许国家办学，不许集体和群众办学；第二，只许办一种全日制学校，不许办半日制的学校。这是一种完全无视国家的需要和生产力发展水平，无视人民的学习要求和经济情况，无视农村的特点和劳动力情况的荒谬主张。其实质，是束缚住群众的双手，不让群众办学，只能由他们这些“专家”办学；教育不能多快好省地发展，要慢慢来。但是，1958年的实践证明，走群众路线，用统一性与多样性相结合的原则来办学，必然是热热闹闹，百花盛开，教育事业大发展大跃进；用资产阶级教育家的原则来办学，必然是冷冷清清，独花雕零，教育事业停顿下来。为了发展教育事业，我们需要大量的教育家，但必须是为无产阶级政治服务的教育家，包括相当一部分从旧社会来的、但是已经走上又红又专道路的教育家。教育工作的专门队伍必须与群众结合，专家必须与群众结合，教育事业才能多快好省地发展。
    看来，在什么是“正规”这个问题上，我们同资产阶级教育家又有着原则的分歧。我们是需要正规的教育的。同时认为，正规的教育是从生产发展的水平出发、而又为生产的发展服务的。根据总路线的精神和党的群众路线，全党全民办学，学校形式多种多样，就是社会主义教育的“正规”，因为只有这种做法才切合我们当前的实际，才能多快好省地提高人民群众的文化水平，促进生产力的发展。只许国家办，不许集体和群众办，我省不可能这样快地建成每个专区有工、农、医、师一套专科学校，绝大部分市有工、农、医、师一套中等专业学校，很多人民公社有了从幼儿到成人、全日制到半日制、小学到中学的各类学校的一整套体系；只办全日制学校，不办半日制学校，就要使大批高小毕业生失学，也不可能多快好省地为公社培养出大批初级技术人员和干部。因此，照资产阶级教育家的“正规”办事，无论对国家、对人民都是不利的。我们现在这样做是完全正确的。衡量一种学校正规不正规的主要标准，是教育的质量如何。我们的教育，无论是全日制学校还是半日制学校，都是为了培养具有社会主义和共产主义的觉悟、有解决实际问题能力的全面发展的新人，这是教育真正的质量。从这个意义上讲，我们的学校，是真正的正规学校。难道说，那些虽然有高楼大厦洋装书，但是以法西斯主义、剥削观点、等级思想、奴化思想来教育青年的国民党学校，倒是“正规”的吗？我们的半日制学校，方向正确，群众拥护，我们有办好它的决心。任何新创的事业总是比较粗糙的，需要在发展的过程中使它得到完善。农业中学开办时，教室、教材……什么也没有，但是逐步地都有了，比刚开办时完善得多了。这就是例子。我们的学校形式不是永远不变的，当客观条件起了变化了，生产力水平提高了，我们的学校就会办得更加完善，各类学校的形式会发展得更加适合那个时候的生产力要求和人民的要求。
