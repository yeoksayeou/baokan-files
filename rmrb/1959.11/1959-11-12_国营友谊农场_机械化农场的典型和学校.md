Wang Zhenglin, Director of the State-owned Friendship Farm

    In 1954, during the National Day celebrations, the Soviet government delegation, headed by Comrade Khrushchev, presented China with a complete set of machinery and equipment for a large-scale grain farm and sent a large number of experts to help China establish a large-scale grain farm to disseminate the experience of large-scale land reclamation and the experience of operating and managing state-owned farms. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council decided to establish this farm in the Hejiang area of Heilongjiang Province, naming it "State-owned Friendship Farm" to symbolize the close unity between China and the Soviet Union. Since 1954, under the leadership of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, and thanks to the assistance of Soviet experts and the hard work of all employees, this once-uninhabited grassland has been transformed into a base for producing large quantities of commercial grain and non-staple foods.
    The Friendship Farm began reclaiming land and building the farm in 1955 and officially started production in 1956. In the past four years, it has reclaimed more than 46,000 hectares (over 700,000 mu) of wasteland for the farm itself, fraternal farms, and immigrants. It has now developed into a large-scale agricultural enterprise with more than 670,000 mu of cultivated land and more than 5,000 employees. In the three years since it was put into production, although it suffered severe floods for two years, it still produced more than 140 million jin of grain for the country and transferred more than 10 million jin of high-quality soybean and wheat seeds to fraternal farms and regions. This year, the total grain output of the farm is expected to reach more than 100 million jin (excluding feed); the farm raises 32,000 pigs, 180,000 chickens, and 1,900 head of draft cattle, and has begun to produce and supply large quantities of pork and eggs for export and urban needs. In September of this year alone, it sold 2,700 fat pigs to the state and supplied 2,300 breeding pigs and more than 280,000 hatching eggs to fraternal farms and people's communes. Under the policy of developing both industry and agriculture, the farm has established 46 small factories. The total industrial and agricultural output value for this year is expected to reach more than 20 million yuan. Since its establishment, the farm has been profitable every year, and by the end of 1958, it had turned over a profit of 1.09 million yuan. This year, it is expected to turn over a profit of more than 2 million yuan.
    The Friendship Farm is not only a production enterprise, but also undertakes the task of disseminating advanced agricultural production experience and training cadres. Through production practice, many advanced Soviet agricultural production experiences have been tested and disseminated to all parts of the country by the Friendship Farm. In recent years, more than 5,000 cadres, technicians, and students from Hainan Island in the southernmost part of the country, Xinjiang in the northwest, and Beijing, Nanjing, and more than a dozen other provinces and cities have come to the farm for internships and visits. The farm has run four training courses for machinery technicians, and has trained a large number of cadres and technicians through production practice. Before May 1958, it had transferred 468 people to state-owned farms across the country to participate in farm construction, land reclamation, and other work. The farm also dispatched machinery and manpower to Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan, Hunan, and other provinces during agricultural production gaps to help with wheat harvesting and land reclamation.
    With the development of production, the material and cultural life of the employees has also greatly improved. The farm has built 79,000 square meters of collective dormitories, residences, canteens, and nurseries. Eight of the nine branch farms have installed electrical equipment, and the nights are brightly lit. The farm has clubs, libraries, an amateur cultural troupe, a mobile film projection team, and various amateur sports organizations, enriching the cultural life of the employees. The farm has three middle schools and fifty-seven primary schools, with a total of 7,250 students enrolled, and more than 8,000 employees participate in spare-time schools to study politics, culture, and technology.
    These achievements are a victory for the leadership of the Party. It fully proves the correctness of the guidelines and policies on land reclamation and the proper management of state-owned farms as stipulated in the Party Central Committee's National Program for Agricultural Development.
    According to the Party Central Committee's policy of developing state-owned farms with less investment, quick results, and high returns, as well as the policy of combining production and construction, the farm completed the state's task of reclaiming 20,000 hectares in the first year, and sowed more than 3,200 hectares of crops on raw wasteland in the same year, harvesting more than 3,600 tons of grain, which solved part of the farm's food and seed needs. In the second year, it continued to reclaim land and sow 25,400 hectares, and in addition to completely solving the farm's own needs for seeds, food, and feed, it turned over more than 24,700 tons of wheat and soybeans to the state. Facts have proved that this method of advancing land reclamation, production, and construction simultaneously is a high-speed path for developing state-owned farms, and is a path of more, faster, better, and more economical results.
    The farm has implemented the policy of developing diversified operations, but the focus of production is agriculture. Because agriculture is the foundation for developing animal husbandry and the processing of agricultural and sideline products. If state-owned farms do not have a solid agricultural foundation, it is impossible to develop all undertakings. According to the state's requirements for state-owned farms to serve as bases for producing agricultural and livestock products and commodities, the core of diversified operations is the integration of agriculture and animal husbandry; industry and sideline occupations should be developed according to resource conditions to help and promote the development of agricultural and livestock production. The industries established by the Friendship Farm are primarily the machinery repair, parts, and agricultural tool manufacturing industries necessary for agricultural machinery. In order to meet the needs of agricultural and livestock development, a number of processing industries that utilize agricultural and sideline products and can use by-products as feed have been established, such as rice, flour, oil, wine, sugar, and food processing. In addition, necessary building materials industries have also been established, such as brick making, lime burning, and wood processing. The industrial output value in 1958 reached 44% of the total output value. Practice over the years has proved that the policy of developing diversified operations is correct. This allows the farm's resources to be fully utilized, and at the same time, in terms of labor organization, industry and sideline occupations can be carried out on a large scale during the slack season, increasing labor productivity. A portion of industry and sideline occupations can be suspended during the busy agricultural season, which is conducive to the smooth completion of agricultural blitz operations. Diversified operations enable the rational use of funds, accelerate the turnover rate of funds, and can rapidly increase wealth, accumulate funds, and ensure profitable production even in the event of severe natural disasters.
    Improving labor productivity is the main way to develop production at high speed. In the years since its establishment, the farm has been trying every possible means to improve labor productivity and speed up production as much as possible. The first method to improve labor productivity is to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements and increase the degree of mechanization. In recent years, with the help of Soviet experts and the creative labor of employees, many tools have been innovated. In agriculture, seeding and fertilizing machines, inter-tillage and topdressing machines, automatic truck unloading of grain, pesticide seed mixing machines, grain spreading machines, winnowing machines, and grain bagging machines have been created and modified. In animal husbandry, automated feed processing plants, automatic feeding troughs for pigs and chickens, automatic waterers, and feed crushing and cutting machines for grain, pasture, and silage have been established. The use of these machines has increased production efficiency by two, three, or even a dozen times.
    Timely adjustments to the labor organization based on the development of production, and organizing mutual collaboration between departments and the unified and centralized use of forces, can also greatly improve labor productivity. As a result of the experiments conducted by the Second Production Team of the Fifth Branch Farm of the Friendship Farm using these methods, each agricultural worker (including agricultural machinery workers and agricultural workers) produced more than 80,000 jin of grain per year in 1957. Even in 1958, when they suffered severe natural disasters due to waterlogging in the early stage and drought in the later stage, each worker produced more than 40,000 jin of grain per year. This year, we will continue to help this team carry out pilot projects, adopt highly mechanized methods, and strive to achieve the goal of an average of more than 100,000 jin of grain produced per employee per year.
    Relying on the leadership of the Party in production, relying on the masses to fight hard, and combining large-scale mass movements with scientific management is the fundamental guarantee for running a large-scale state-owned farm with agriculture as its main focus, diversified operations, and mechanization. In recent years, on the basis of carrying out large-scale mass movements, learning from the advanced management experience of Soviet farms, and various management systems have been understood and mastered by the majority of employees. With the development of production and the gradual deepening of mass movements, all employees have continuously developed and improved these systems to adapt to the new situation and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. For example, the "no questions asked for ten days of work" in planning management, the tasks, quotas, and requirements are handed over to the masses, and leading cadres follow the work, spread experience, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner, promoting one wave after another of production upsurges, and ensuring the normal order of production. The principle of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" has been specifically implemented, greatly improving the level of enterprise management. Thanks to relying on the leadership of the Party, overcoming right-leaning ideas, and boosting enthusiasm, in August and September of this year, the entire farm launched another "soldier against soldier, general against general" competition. The advanced producers Hao Huanwen and Cui Shaohua had outstanding deeds and clear banners, becoming the goals for the majority of employees to learn from, catch up with, and surpass.
    In recent years, the Friendship Farm has resolutely relied on the leadership of the Party, implemented the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, relied on the hard work of the masses, overcome numerous difficulties, and achieved brilliant achievements.

    国营友谊农场——机械化农场的典型和学校
    农垦部副部长兼中共合江地委第一书记　张林池
  　国营友谊农场场长　王正林
    1954年国庆节时，以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联政府代表团，赠送我国一个大型谷物农场的全部机械设备，并派大批专家帮助我国建立一个大型谷物农场，以传播大规模开荒的经验和国营农场经营管理的经验。中共中央和国务院决定把这个农场建立在黑龙江省合江地区，命名为“国营友谊农场”，象征中苏的亲密团结。从1954年起，在中央和省委的领导下，在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，由于苏联专家的帮助和全体职工的艰苦奋斗，已使这片荒无人烟的草原，变成大量生产商品粮和副食品的基地。
    友谊农场于1955年开荒建场，1956年正式投入生产。四年多来，为本场、兄弟场和移民共开荒四万六千多公顷（七十余万亩），现在已发展成为拥有耕地六十七万余亩和职工五千多人的大型农业企业了。在投入生产的三年中，虽然有两年受了严重水灾，但是仍为国家生产了粮食一亿四千多万斤，输送给兄弟农场和兄弟地区优良的大豆、小麦种籽一千多万斤。今年全场粮食产量预计可达一亿多斤（除饲料外）；全场养猪三万二千头，鸡十八万只，役牛一千九百头，并开始大量生产供应出口和城市需要的猪肉、鸡蛋。仅在今年9月份以前，就交售给国家肥猪二千七百头，供应兄弟农场及人民公社种猪二千三百头，种卵二十八万余枚。在工农业生产并举的方针下，农场建立了四十六个小型工厂。今年工农业总产值预计可达二千多万元。农场从建场以来，年年生产有利，到1958年年底，已上缴利润一百零九万元。今年预计可上缴利润二百多万元。
    友谊农场不仅是个生产企业，还担负着传播先进农业生产经验和培养干部的任务。通过生产实践，许多苏联农业生产的先进经验，由友谊农场进行试验并传播到全国各地。几年来，从祖国最南部的海南岛，最西北的新疆，以及北京、南京等十几个省市，有五千余名干部、技术人员和学生来场实习和参观。农场共开办过四次机务技术人员训练班，通过生产实践培养了大批干部和技术人员。1958年5月以前，就输送四百六十八名到全国各地国营农场参加建场、开荒等工作。农场还在农业生产间隙派机械和人力到湖北、江西、安徽、河南、湖南等省帮助收刈小麦和开荒。
    随着生产的发展，职工的物质文化生活也有很大提高。全场已建筑了七万九千平方米的集体宿舍、住宅、食堂和托儿所。九个分场有八个分场安装了电气设备，夜晚一片灯光辉煌。农场设有俱乐部、图书馆，并有业余文工团，流动电影放映队和各种业余体育组织，丰富着职工的文化生活。农场共设中学三所，小学五十七所，入学学生共达七千二百五十人，并有八千余名职工参加业余学校，学习政治、文化和技术。
    这些成就，是党的领导的胜利。它充分证明了党中央制定的农业发展纲要中所规定的关于开荒和办好国营农场的方针、政策的正确。
    根据党中央关于发展国营农场投资少、收效快、收益大的方针，以及边生产边建设的方针，农场在第一年就完成了国家所交给开荒两万公顷的任务，并在生荒地上当年播种三千二百多公顷作物，收获了三千六百多吨谷物，解决了农场部分吃粮和种子。第二年继续开荒，并播种二万五千四百公顷，除全部解决了农场本身所需要的种子、食粮和饲料以外，上缴给国家二万四千七百多吨小麦和大豆。事实证明，这种开荒、生产、建设同时并进的方法，是一条高速度发展国营农场的道路，是一条多、快、好、省的道路。
    农场执行了发展多种经营的方针；但生产的重点是农业。因为农业是发展畜牧事业、发展农副产品加工企业的基础。国营农场如果没有巩固的农业基础，就不可能发展一切事业。根据国家把国营农场做为生产农畜产品、商品基地的要求，多种经营的中心是农牧结合；工业和副业应该根据资源情况来发展，帮助和促进农牧业生产的发展。友谊农场建立的工业，首先是农业机械所必须的机械修理、零件和农具制造工业，为了适应农牧业发展需要，建立了一批利用农副产品，并能以副产品作饲料的加工工业，这就是米、面、油、酒、糖、食品加工等。此外，还建立了必要的建筑原料工业，如制砖、烧石灰、木材加工等。1958年的工业产值已达到总产值的44％。几年来的实践证明，发展多种经营的方针是正确的。这样可以使农场资源得以充分利用，同时在劳动组织上，农闲可以大搞工业和副业，提高劳动生产率，农忙又可以停下一部分工业和副业，有利于农业突击性作业的顺利完成。多种经营，使资金运用合理，加速资金周转率，并可迅速增加财富，积累资金，保证在遭受严重自然灾害时，仍然能做到生产有利。
    提高劳动生产率，这是高速度发展生产的主要途径。建场几年来，农场一直是千方百计提高劳动生产率，尽一切可能将生产速度加快。提高劳动生产率的方法，首先是开展技术革新和技术革命运动，提高机械化程度。几年来在苏联专家帮助和职工创造性的劳动中，革新了不少工具。在农业上，创造和改装出播种施肥机、中耕追肥机、汽车自动卸粮、农药拌种机、粮食摊晒机、扬场机、粮食装袋机等。在畜牧业上，建立了饲料加工自动化工厂，猪和鸡的自动食槽，自动饮水器，谷物、牧草、青贮切割三用饲料粉碎切割机等。使用这些机械，使生产效率提高两倍、三倍甚至十几倍。
    根据生产发展的情况，及时调整劳动组织，并组织各部门间的互相协作，统一集中使用力量，也能大大提高劳动生产率。采取这些方法，在友谊农场五分场第二生产队试验的结果，他们在1957年每个农业工人（包括农业机械工人和农工）每年生产粮食八万多斤。就是在1958年前期涝灾、后期干旱，受到严重自然灾害的情况下，每个工人每年生产粮食四万多斤。今年继续帮助这个队进行试点，采取高度机械化的方法，争取达到每个职工平均每年生产粮食十万多斤的指标。
    在生产上依靠党的领导，依靠群众奋战，把大搞群众运动和科学管理相结合，是办好以农业为主、多种经营、机械化的大型国营农场的根本保证。几年来，在大搞群众运动的基础上，学习苏联农场的先进管理经验，各项管理制度被广大职工所了解、掌握；随着生产的发展和群众运动的逐步深入，全体职工不断发展和改进这些制度，以适应新的形势，充分发挥了群众的积极性、创造性。如计划管理上的“十日工作不用问”，把任务、定额、要求交给群众，领导干部再跟班劳动，传播经验，及时发现和解决问题，推动了生产高潮一浪接一浪，并保证了生产正常秩序，具体贯彻了“两参一改三结合”的原则，大大提高了企业管理水平。由于依靠党的领导，克服右倾思想，大鼓干劲，在今年8、9月中，全场又掀起“兵对兵、将对将”的竞赛，先进生产者郝焕文、崔少华事迹突出，旗帜鲜明，成为广大职工学习、追赶、超过的目标。
    几年来，友谊农场就是坚决依靠党的领导，贯彻勤俭办企业的方针，依靠群众奋战，战胜了重重困难，取得了光辉的成就。
