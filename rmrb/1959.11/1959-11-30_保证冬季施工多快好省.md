    Ensure Winter Construction is Fast, Efficient, and Economical

    Winter has arrived, and basic construction projects in Northeast, North, and Northwest China are successively entering winter construction. A new battle has begun on the basic construction front.

    In the past ten months or so, the broad masses of basic construction workers across the country have already achieved brilliant results. Now is the time to seize the last month, expand the achievements, and strive for complete victory. A considerable part of this task will be completed under winter construction conditions. For example, more than 60% of the workload of the Ministry of Construction Engineering system in the fourth quarter is scattered in cold regions such as Northeast, North, and Northwest China. If winter construction in these areas is done well, we can greet 1960 with even greater achievements. Good winter construction can also guarantee a "flying start" next year, so that basic construction in the first quarter of next year will continue to leap forward in an all-round way.

    The conditions for ensuring the victory of winter construction this year are particularly good. The broad masses of basic construction workers across the country have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and launching a socialist emulation campaign to learn from, compare with, catch up with, and help the advanced. This is a decisive factor in creating new victories. In the past few years, especially during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, construction and installation enterprises in Northeast, North, and Northwest China have accumulated a lot of successful experience in winter construction techniques and organization and management. Of course, there are still some difficulties in this year's winter construction. For example, the tasks are heavy, time is tight, and there are many projects to be completed; fuel and chemical additives cannot fully meet the needs; and some provincial and regional construction and installation enterprises have just switched from civil buildings to industrial buildings, and their experience is insufficient. However, as long as we boost our morale, deeply mobilize the masses, and make full use of the rich experience since the Great Leap Forward, we will surely be able to overcome difficulties and win a great and beautiful battle in winter.

    How can we do a good job in winter construction? The fundamental guarantee is to strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and launch a mass movement in a big way. Leading personnel of relevant units must personally take action, grasp plans, grasp measures, conduct in-depth inspections of preparations, and promptly solve major problems. During the construction process, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution on a large scale, and vigorously promote effective advanced experience. During the Great Leap Forward last year, many regions implemented many fast, efficient, and economical winter construction methods. These good experiences should be actively promoted, and at the same time, workers should be encouraged to continue to create new experiences based on the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods and adapting to local conditions. In winter construction, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses to rely on their own efforts, engage in diversified operations in a big way, and strengthen cooperation with construction, design, material supply, and scientific research departments, so as to better solve the supply of heat preservation and cold protection materials and promptly solve construction technology and other issues. According to the characteristics of winter construction, while launching mass movements in a big way, attention should be paid to strengthening construction management. Because winter construction is more complex and meticulous than construction at normal temperatures, it is necessary to earnestly strengthen temperature measurement and material inspection, strengthen the technical responsibility system for construction and the inspection system for quality and safety, and educate workers to conscientiously implement operating procedures. In addition, it is also necessary to pay close attention to fire prevention.

    In winter construction, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of concentrating superior forces to ensure key projects. Key projects that are planned to be put into production this year should be included in the winter construction projects as soon as possible, and phased and batch construction plans and technical measures should be formulated to ensure completion on schedule. Phased and batch construction can not only concentrate superior forces and speed up construction, but also save heat source equipment and thermal insulation and cold protection equipment due to the concentration of construction areas. While grasping this year's construction projects, we must also make preparations for the construction projects in the first quarter of next year, so as to ensure continuous leaps forward wave after wave.

    The curtain on winter construction has already been raised. It is hoped that the basic construction workers in Northeast, North, and Northwest China will boost their morale, seize the time, and fight this battle well, to "add icing on the cake" to this year's leap forward and lay a good foundation for next year's leap forward!

    保证冬季施工多快好省
    冬季已到，东北、华北、西北等地的基本建设工程正陆续进入冬季施工。基本建设战线上一个新的战役开始了。
    全国基本建设职工在过去的十个多月中，已经创造了辉煌的成绩。现在是抓紧最后一个月，扩大战果，争取全胜的时候。这一任务，有相当一部分要在冬季施工的情况下完成。例如，建筑工程部系统第四季度的工作量，就有60％以上散处在东北、华北、西北等寒冷地区。这些地区的冬季施工搞好了，我们就可以用更大的成就迎接1960年。冬季施工搞好了，还可以保证明年“开门红”，使明年第一季度的基本建设继续全面跃进。
    今年保证冬季施工胜利的条件特别好。全国基本建设战线的广大职工热烈响应党的八届八中全会的号召，反右倾，鼓干劲，掀起了学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进的社会主义竞赛热潮。这是创造新胜利的决定性因素。几年来，特别是1958年的大跃进中，东北、华北、西北等地的建筑安装企业，已经在冬季施工的施工技术和组织管理等方面积累了不少成功的经验。当然，今年冬季施工中也还有一定的困难。例如，任务大，时间紧，竣工项目多；燃料、化学附加剂还不能完全满足需要；部分省、区的建筑安装企业刚由民用建筑转上工业建筑，经验不足等。但是，只要我们鼓足干劲，深入发动群众，充分利用大跃进以来的丰富经验，就一定能战胜困难，在冬季打个大大的漂亮仗。
    怎样才能搞好冬季施工呢？根本的保证是加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。各有关单位的领导人员要亲自动手，抓计划，抓措施，深入检查准备情况，及时解决重大问题。施工过程中，要发动群众大搞技术革新和技术革命，大力推广行之有效的先进经验。在去年大跃进中，许多地区实行了许多多快好省的冬季施工方法。这些好的经验都应积极推广，同时要鼓励职工根据土洋并举因地制宜的原则，继续创造新的经验。冬季施工中，还要发动群众自力更生，大搞多种经营，加强同建设、设计、材料供应、科学研究等部门的协作，以便更好地解决保温、防寒等材料的供应问题，及时解决施工技术等问题。根据冬季施工的特点，在大搞群众运动的同时要注意加强施工管理工作。因为冬季施工比在常温下施工更为复杂细致，所以必须认真加强测温和材料检验等工作，加强施工的技术责任制和质量、安全的检查制度，教育职工切实贯彻执行操作规程。另外，还要抓紧防火工作。
    冬季施工中，要继续贯彻集中优势力量保证重点的方针。凡是计划在今年内投入生产的重点工程，要尽先列入冬季施工项目，并且订出分期、分批的施工计划和技术措施，保证按期完成。分期分批施工，不仅可以集中优势力量，加快建设速度，而且由于施工区域集中，还能节省热源设备和保温防寒器材。在抓紧今年建设工程的同时，也要为明年第一季度的工程项目作好施工准备，以便保证一浪接一浪地继续不断地跃进。
    冬季施工的序幕已经揭开。希望东北、华北、西北等地的基本建设职工鼓足干劲，抓紧时间，打好这一仗，为今年的跃进“锦上添花”，为明年的跃进打下良好的基础！
