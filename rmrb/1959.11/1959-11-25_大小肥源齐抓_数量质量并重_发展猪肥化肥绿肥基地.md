Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 23rd. Hebei Province, while vigorously developing water conservancy, has launched a winter fertilizer accumulation and production campaign focusing on raising pigs to accumulate manure, vigorously developing local chemical fertilizers, and building fertilizer bases.

In the winter fertilizer accumulation campaign, Hebei Province has prominently focused on raising pigs to accumulate manure. More than 56,000 collective pig farms have been established throughout the province, becoming year-round fertilizer accumulation bases. The Shijiazhuang Special Zone is building large-scale manure bases, proposing that every county and commune should build thousand-pig farms and ten-thousand-pig farms, and every production brigade and small team should build thousand-pig farms and hundred-pig farms. Jiaocheng County has formed a mass pig-raising upsurge, increasing the number of live pigs by more than 72,000 in just over 20 days. To solve the contradictions of labor and animal power shortages for transporting fertilizer, various places are building "square field pig farms" (pig farms built within high-yield squares). Wuqiao and Ding counties have built more than 3,100 square field pig farms. In late October alone, Wenren and Ranzhuang communes in Qingyuan District, Baoding City, built pig farms in 98 high-yield wheat squares, built 2,330 pigsties, and increased the number of pigs by more than 2,300 at the same time, achieving pig farms in every square and every team, and pigs in every pigsty.

While vigorously grasping pig raising and manure accumulation, various places are vigorously developing local chemical fertilizer production and expanding local and foreign chemical fertilizer bases. More than 7,000 new local chemical fertilizer plants have been built throughout the province. Baoding Special Zone has begun construction of six foreign chemical fertilizer plants in Xushui, Anguo, and other places. Chengde Special Zone, Zhangjiakou City, and other places are all preparing to build small and medium-sized chemical fertilizer plants. Nangong Chengguan Commune has newly built and expanded 123 local chemical fertilizer plants, producing more than 8.2 million catties of local chemical fertilizer. The Dazhao Production Team of this county has produced eight kinds of local chemical fertilizers such as ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate, and bacterial fertilizer, all of which are of good quality. Nanying Commune in Gaocheng County has built 93 local chemical fertilizer plants while building the plants, producing more than 25,000 catties of chemical fertilizer.

In the fertilizer accumulation campaign, various places are seizing the current favorable opportunity, grasping both large and small fertilizer sources, emphasizing both quantity and quality, and adopting various fertilizer accumulation methods. Shijiazhuang City, Zhengding, Hengshui, Xinle, and other counties have adopted fertilizer accumulation methods such as scraping weeds, sweeping leaves, sweeping street soil, and digging sewage ditches. Cunrui Commune in Huailai County, in order to ensure the quality of fertilizer, each production team has established an inspection and acceptance system, and carries out coarse fertilizer processing to improve fertilizer efficiency.

People's Daily, Chengdu, November 24th. The chemical industry department of Sichuan Province has adopted the policy of "walking on two legs." While focusing on running large-scale chemical industrial enterprises, it vigorously develops medium and small-scale chemical industrial enterprises, actively increasing the production of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemical products to support agriculture's continued leap forward next year.

According to the characteristics of Sichuan's abundant and widely distributed resources, the chemical industry department of Sichuan Province, while engaging in foreign methods of producing chemical fertilizers and pesticides, fully mobilized the masses to engage in small-scale local production groups. Last year, in a very short period of time, more than 100,000 small and simple fertilizer and pesticide factories were established throughout the province. These factories, after rectification, consolidation, and improvement this year, have played a huge role, producing a large number of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to support rural areas. As of the end of October, the province has produced 28,197 tons of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer, a net increase of 3.16 times compared to the total output of last year; 4,045 tons of raw material pesticides, a net increase of 1.33 times compared to the total output of last year; and 30,139 tons of processed pesticides, an increase of 11.6% compared to the same period last year. The variety of products produced this year has also increased. The chemical industry has increased products such as ammonium sulfate, potash fertilizer, and humic acid salts; the pesticide industry has increased products such as barium sulfide, 666 barium chloride mixture, and DDT sulfur mixture.

In order to further develop the chemical fertilizer and pesticide industry, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Chemical Industry, according to the requirements of agriculture's continued leap forward next year, in addition to continuing to complete the construction of Sichuan Chemical Plant, one of China's largest chemical enterprises, will strengthen the construction of medium and small-scale chemical enterprises next year, and enrich and expand some of the original backbone plants. In areas with concentrated resources, several mechanized or semi-mechanized medium-sized plants will be built as key projects. In order to promote small synthetic ammonia plants on a large scale next year, the Provincial Department of Chemical Industry is actively building a small synthetic ammonia plant with an annual output of 800 tons in Chongqing as a demonstration. The Department of Chemical Industry has also further strengthened technical guidance, appraisal and promotion for local chemical fertilizers that have been produced in large quantities by counties and communes. Nanchong Special Zone has recently appraised 41 kinds of local chemical fertilizers, of which 35 have been decided to be promoted. The Special Zone has also formulated specific measures to improve the quality and reduce the cost of local chemical fertilizers.

The Sichuan Provincial Department of Chemical Industry has also taken active and effective measures for the production of raw materials needed for the large-scale production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides next year.

According to the "New Hunan Daily" news, the broad masses of cadres and peasants in Changde County, Hunan Province, with full determination and soaring enthusiasm, are vigorously cultivating green manure, laying a fertilizer foundation for increased rice production next year.

This year, the county has sown a total of 950,000 mu of green manure. From the very beginning, the county party committee attached great importance to increasing green manure production. The county party committee believes that green manure is a kind of fine fertilizer, and as long as it is carefully cultivated, green manure can achieve high yields. Of the more than 600,000 mu of green manure planted throughout the county last winter, more than 110,000 mu yielded 10,000 catties or more per mu. This year's green manure planting area is large, and striving for high yields is conditional. According to the instructions of the county party committee, each commune has generally established green manure cultivation professional teams, implemented the "three guarantees" responsibility system, and strengthened cultivation management in a timely manner. Generally, the growth is good.

In order to do a better job of green manure cultivation, the county party committee held an on-site meeting at the Luzhou Brigade of Dongfeng Commune, where the green manure grows particularly well, on November 6th to further exchange experiences in cultivating green manure. The 8,113 mu of green manure fields in this brigade have balanced growth in every field and are particularly lush. Among them, the red flower clover seedlings in 30% of the green manure fields are already a foot deep, and the blue flower bitter vegetable seedlings are more than three feet deep. The green manure has covered the entire field surface, truly a green sea. The main reasons why this brigade's green manure was planted early and well this year are that it focused on two tasks in cultivation management: one is to open good drainage ditches, and the other is to topdress to promote seedling growth. At the same time, the cadres and party members in the team selected more than 900 mu of green manure with poor growth as high-yield fields, took the lead in cultivation, and guided the commune members to plant and manage well. Subsequently, a green manure cultivation competition movement of "learning from Luzhou, catching up with Luzhou, and surpassing Luzhou" has been launched throughout the county. At present, 20% of the brigades have caught up with the Luzhou Brigade, and 60% of the brigades have reached the growth level of the Luzhou Brigade's green manure in early November.

    大小肥源齐抓　数量质量并重
    发展猪肥化肥绿肥基地
    河北已办起集体养猪场五万多个新建土化肥厂七千多座
    四川发动群众大办中小型化工企业生产大量化肥和农药
    湖南常德县扩大绿肥种植面积加强培养管理力争绿肥高产
    新华社天津23日电　河北省在大搞水利的同时，一个以养猪积肥、大搞土化肥和大建肥料基地的冬季积肥造肥运动，已经开展起来。
    河北省在冬季积肥运动中，突出抓住了养猪积肥。全省已建立集体养猪场五万六千多个，成为常年积肥的基地。石家庄专区大建圈肥基地，提出县县社社都搞千猪场、万猪场，生产大队和小队都建千猪场、百猪场。交河县形成群众性的养猪高潮，二十多天即增加生猪七万二千多头。为了解决运肥劳力、畜力紧张的矛盾，各地大建“方田猪场”（在丰产方内建猪场）。吴桥、定县已建方田猪场三千一百多个。保定市清苑区温仁、冉庄两个公社仅10月下旬，就在九十八个小麦丰产方内建起猪场九十八个，建圈两千三百三十间，同时增猪两千三百多头，达到了方方队队有猪场、场场圈圈都有猪。
    各地在大抓养猪积肥的同时，大搞土化肥生产，扩建土、洋化肥基地。全省已新建土化肥厂七千多座。保定专区已在徐水、安国等地开始兴建六座洋化肥厂。承德专区、张家口市等地，县县都在筹建中小型化肥厂。南宫城关公社新建和扩建土化肥厂一百二十三座，已生产土化肥八百二十多万斤。这个县的大召生产队，制出了氯化铵、硝酸铵、菌肥等八种土化肥，质量都很好。藁城县南营公社，边建厂边生产，已建起土化肥厂九十三个，并生产化肥二万五千多斤。
    在积肥运动中，各地抓住当前有利时机，大小肥源一齐抓，数量质量并重，并且采用多样积肥方法。石家庄市、正定、衡水、新乐等县，采取了刮杂草、扫树叶、扫街土、挖污水沟等积肥方法。怀来县存瑞公社，为保证肥料的质量，各生产队都建立了检查验收制度，并进行粗肥加工，提高肥效。
    本报成都24日电　四川省化学工业部门采取两条腿走路的方针，在重点举办大型化学工业企业的同时，大力发展中、小型化学工业企业，积极增产化肥、农药和其他各种化工制品，支援农业明年继续跃进。
    四川省化学工业部门根据四川资源丰富和分布广的特点，在搞洋法生产化肥、农药的同时，充分发动群众大搞小土群，去年在很短时间内就在全省办起了十万多个小型简易的化肥和农药厂。这些厂今年整顿、巩固、提高后，发挥了巨大的作用，生产了大量的化肥、农药支援农村。截至10月底止，全省已生产了钙镁磷肥二万八千一百九十七吨，比去年全年产量净增三点一六倍，原料农药四千零四十五吨，比去年全年产量净增一点三三倍；加工农药三万零一百三十九吨，较去年同期增长了11.6％。今年生产的品种也增多了。化工增加了硫酸铵、钾肥、胡敏酸盐等产品；农药增加了硫化钡、666氯化钡合剂、DDT硫磺合剂等产品。
    为了进一步发展化肥、农药工业，四川省化工厅根据明年农业生产继续跃进的要求，除继续完成我国最大的化工企业之一的四川化工厂的建设外，明年将加强中、小型化工企业建设，并充实和扩大一部分原有的骨干厂，在资源集中的地区将重点办几个机械化或半机械化的中型厂。为了明年大量推广小合成氨厂，省化工厅已在重庆积极建设一座年产八百吨的小合成氨厂作为示范。对各县、公社已经大量生产的土化肥，化工厅也进一步加强了技术指导与鉴定推广工作。南充专区最近已经鉴定了四十一种土化肥，其中有三十五种决定推广。这个专区并制定了提高土化肥质量和降低成本的具体措施。
    四川省化学工业部门对明年大量生产化肥、农药所需的原料生产，也采取了积极有效的措施。
    据新湖南报消息　湖南省常德县广大干部和农民群众正以十足的决心，冲天的干劲，大力培育绿肥，为明年稻谷增产打下肥料基础。
    今年，这个县共播种绿肥九十五万亩。从一开始，县委就非常重视绿肥增产。县委认为：绿肥是一种精肥，只要认真培育，绿肥是能够高产的。去冬全县种的六十多万亩绿肥中，就有十一万多亩亩产万斤或万斤以上。今年绿肥播种面积大，力争高产是有条件的。各公社根据县委的指示，普遍建立了绿肥培育专业队，实行了“三包”责任制，及时加强培育管理，一般生长良好。
    为了把绿肥的培育工作作得更好，县委11月
  6日又在绿肥生长得特别好的东风公社芦洲大队召开了一次现场会，进一步交流培育绿肥的经验。这个大队的八千一百一十三亩绿肥田，丘丘生长平衡，特别茂盛，其中有30％的绿肥田的红花草子已一尺来深，蓝花苦子已三尺多深。绿肥已铺满田面，真是一片绿海。这个大队今年的绿肥种得早、种得好，主要是在培育管理方面突出抓住了两件工作，一是开好排水沟，一是追肥提苗。同时，队里的干部和党员选了九百多亩生长差的绿肥作为丰产田，带头培育，指导社员种好管好。接着，在全县范围内已展开了一个“学芦洲、赶芦洲、超芦洲”的培育绿肥竞赛运动。目前已有20％的大队的绿肥赶上了芦洲大队，60％大队的绿肥已达到11月上旬时芦洲大队绿肥的生长水平。（附图片）
