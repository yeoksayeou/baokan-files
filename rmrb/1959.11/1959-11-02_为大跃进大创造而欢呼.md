    Cheering for the Great Leap Forward and Great Creation
    Yang Ligong, Director of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant

    The First Tractor Manufacturing Plant is a modern, large-scale machine manufacturing plant. The entire plant has a complete production system, as well as comprehensive support departments and service systems. Once production reaches the designed level, it can produce 15,000 "Dongfanghong" (East is Red) diesel crawler tractors of 54 horsepower annually. The completion and commissioning of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant marks that China's agricultural production will gradually be armed with modern machinery. This is the victory of the Party's General Line, the victory of the Great Leap Forward, and the victory of the revolutionary mass movement.

    In the practice of building the plant, we deeply realized that the Party's General Line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism" is the beacon illuminating all our work and an unparalleled force inspiring us to move forward. In 1956, encouraged by the high tide of agricultural collectivization, the construction of our plant saw its first upsurge. Within a year, the main workshop buildings of the entire plant were almost completed in terms of their external structure, creating the miracle of completing the external construction of a large 24,000-square-meter workshop in just 38 working days. Especially after the great victory of the anti-Rightist and rectification movements, and after the Party's General Line for socialist construction was proposed in 1958, adhering to putting politics in command and implementing the mass line greatly stimulated the socialist consciousness of all employees. The broad masses of employees were spirited, high in morale, liberated their thinking, unleashed soaring revolutionary drive, and launched a magnificent mass movement for socialist construction, thereby greatly accelerating the pace of plant construction. Within a year, the face of the factory was completely renewed, and the annual capital construction workload was overfulfilled. The capital construction investment completed in 1958 was equivalent to the total of the previous two years.

    Over the past year, the process of a series of mass movements has also been the process of struggle between two roads and two methods. Because of the continuous and resolute criticism of the view that large-scale new factories are not suitable for large-scale mass movements; the criticism of the technical mystery view that only relies on a few engineers and technicians and does not rely on the broad masses of workers; the criticism of the view that new factories cannot carry out large-scale technical revolutions; the criticism of the one-sided view of conditions that only sees objects and not people; the criticism of the idea of simply relying on and reaching out upwards for assistance, etc., the large-scale mass movement has developed wave upon wave, with one high tide following another.

    In 1958, the scale of factory construction expanded, requiring a large number of various standard and non-standard machinery and equipment. We proposed: in the spirit of self-reliance, relying on our first batch of auxiliary workshops to manufacture some non-standard equipment. However, some people lacked confidence. They believed that the workshops had neither the professional knowledge to manufacture machine tool equipment, nor the low technical level of the workers, and it was impossible to undertake the manufacture of complex non-standard equipment, and they could only "patch up" during equipment installation. Obviously, this is contrary to the spirit of the Great Leap Forward. We criticized this thinking. The opposite slogan was put forward: "Do what you can do yourself, make what you can make yourself," "Install one machine and start one machine, don't let machine tools sit idle." This slogan mobilized the enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses of employees and set off a mass movement of factory construction in which everyone used their brains and everyone used their hands. Over the past year, we have made great achievements in this regard. We manufactured: more than 3,000 units of non-standard equipment, 604 standard machine tools, 2,783 electric motors, and more than 750,000 pieces (sets) of various process equipment. If the labor of the above-mentioned various equipment and process equipment was contracted out to a machinery factory with 5,000 people, it would take more than a year, and many of them are large, complex, and relatively precise equipment. In the two workshops of cast steel and cast iron, more than 80% of the complete set of equipment from the furnace (electric furnace, cupola), sand mixing, modeling, sand cleaning to mechanized transportation is self-made by the plant. Now these equipments are all operating normally, producing high-quality tractors. The fallacy that it is impossible to arm oneself was refuted by the facts. In addition, the broad masses of employees, together with various construction units, have also invested in the upsurge of large-scale capital construction. Since 1958, we have installed more than 1,100 sets of equipment by ourselves, completing civil construction and installation worth 2.6 million yuan. Practice has proved that it is natural for a new factory, especially a large factory, to have a longer construction process, with some workshops being built first and others later. After a batch of equipment is installed, it is both necessary and possible to immediately produce some non-standard equipment. Taking the road of self-reliance is our first experience.

    Secondly, while using auxiliary production workshops to carry out self-armament, in accordance with the basic procedures for plant construction, the "three simultaneous" principle (simultaneous civil construction, simultaneous installation, and simultaneous adjustment of production) was implemented in the basic production workshops. Installation work was carried out simultaneously before the civil construction of each plant building was completed; many workshops, with only a few pieces of equipment installed, adopted a method combining designed processes and temporary production, producing the first tractor one year ahead of schedule last "August 1st" (Army Day), and producing 902 units by the time of completion and acceptance. In April of this year, 400 engines were also produced centrally to support rural water conservancy construction. In June, a mass movement was launched around the cross-construction of construction and installation. As a result, tens of thousands of equipment, tens of thousands of sets (pieces) of process equipment, more than a thousand kinds of parts, and dozens of assemblies were completed almost simultaneously with the basic construction in just a little over three months (originally planned for half a year), and more than 60% of the processes reached or exceeded the designed level. This greatly saved time and strived for speed.

    Thirdly, in the process of self-arming our own production, we launched a mass movement of great technical revolution and technical innovation, the result of which was a great increase in labor productivity. In the second half of last year, the tool workshop realized tens of thousands of innovation proposals, and the entire workshop reached a level of 1,000 units per month. However, in the basic production workshop, there was a fierce debate. Some people said: "In a new factory, especially a large factory with advanced design and modern equipment like a tractor factory, it should not and cannot carry out a mass technical innovation movement." Their reason is: the technology of these factories is advanced, the machinery and equipment are new, and the technical level of the workers is low, so they should learn to "walk" before learning to "run." These statements seem reasonable, but in fact they are a passive view; because, from the beginning of design to the start of production, the construction of a factory generally takes several years, and science and technology are constantly developing, not to mention that even the most advanced design cannot be perfect at once? We criticized this passive view. In the process of building the factory, we carried out mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements. In terms of process reform, the two workshops of the engine and fuel system alone have carried out 494 effective reforms. In the product design, not only were some individual and simple reforms carried out, but also some component and assembly innovation tests were carried out. Facts have proved that under the leadership of the Party, the wisdom of the working class is infinite. Through the technical innovation movement, not only were the difficulties in production adjustment overcome, but also outstanding creations were made. For example, the starter on the engine is a major assembly. After four reforms by the three-in-one group, the mechanism was simplified (from 211 kinds and 402 parts to 144 kinds and 291 parts), and the weight was reduced (from 80 kg to 60 kg) while ensuring performance. It can reduce 40% of the labor and save more than 30 processing machine tools. After more than half a year of use and testing, it has been proved that the performance is good, and it can be put into production after the production preparation is done. Of course, a new factory in the process of building and adjusting production should learn the technical data of the design (including products and processes), and should truly understand and master it; it is necessary to establish a clear concept of implementing the process and following the technical regulations in the employees. But this does not mean that it cannot and should not be "reformed." The metaphysical view that absolutely opposes "learning" and "reform" is obviously wrong.

    Fourthly, we adopted the method of teaching in practice and quickly training apprentices. People are the decisive factor in social productive forces and the most valuable asset. How a new factory can quickly cultivate a working class that has both socialist consciousness and a certain level of cultural and technical knowledge is a more important task than building factory buildings and installing machines. Of the more than 10,000 workers gathered in our factory last year, the vast majority were farmers directly from the countryside. Faced with this situation, we adopted a rapid training method combined with production practice, breaking the superstition that apprentices must be trained in technical schools for two or three years before they can graduate. In the training of apprentices, we first strengthened political education, emphasized putting politics in command, adopted a combination of theory and practice, a combination of classroom teaching and machine tool operation, a combination of class training and individual instruction, as well as chain teaching methods of master teaching apprentice, old teaching new, and apprentice teaching apprentice, and launched a teaching movement of all employees centered on rapid training of apprentices, and carried out activities of evaluating and competing for excellent masters and excellent apprentices. This worked very well. Many apprentices quickly learned what they had to learn and mastered the basic operating skills.

    In short, due to the implementation of the General Line and adherence to the method of launching mass movements on a large scale, the speed of factory construction has been accelerated and investment has been saved. These achievements are the result of the Party's leadership and the great leap forward and great creation of the broad masses of employees along the direction pointed out by the Party. At the same time, the broad masses of employees have also educated themselves in the practice of a series of movements, improved their socialist consciousness, established the idea of being masters of the factory as their home, and initially established production order. These iron facts are the most powerful refutation of the right-leaning opportunists' fallacies against the Party's leadership, against the General Line, and against launching mass movements in factories and enterprises. Now, we are full of confidence and working hard to realize the great call of agricultural mechanization put forward by the Party and Chairman Mao.

    为大跃进大创造而欢呼
    第一拖拉机制造厂厂长　杨立功
    第一拖拉机制造厂，是一个现代化大规模的机器制造厂。全厂有完整的生产体系，也有完善的辅助部门和服务系统。生产达到设计水平后，每年可以出产东方红柴油履带式五十四马力拖拉机一万五千台。第一拖拉机制造厂的建成并投入生产，标志着我国农业生产将逐步由现代化机械机械化武装起来。这是党的总路线的胜利，是大跃进的胜利，是革命的群众运动的胜利。
    在建厂实践中我们深刻地体会到：党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线是照耀各项工作的灯塔，是鼓舞我们前进的无比力量。1956年，在农业合作化高潮形势的鼓舞下，我厂的建设出现过第一个高潮，一年之间，全厂大部主要工场场房，差不多都完成了外型建筑，并且创造了以三十八个工作日完成二万四千平方米大型场房外型建筑的高速度施工的奇迹。特别在反右派和整风运动取得巨大胜利的基础上，1958年党的社会主义建设总路线提出后，坚持了政治挂帅，贯彻了群众路线，大大激发了全体职工的社会主义觉悟，广大职工意气风发，斗志昂扬，解放了思想，发挥了冲天的革命干劲，掀起了一个波澜壮阔的社会主义建设的群众运动，从而大大地加快了建厂速度。一年之间，使工厂的面貌焕然一新，超额完成了年度基建工作量，1958年完成的基建投资相当于前两年的总和。
    一年多来，一系列的群众运动的过程也是两条道路、两种方法斗争的过程。由于不断地坚决地批判了大企业新建厂不适于大搞群众运动的观点；批判了只依靠少数工程技术人员不依靠广大工人群众的技术神秘观点；批判了新建厂不能大搞技术革命的观点；批判了唯条件论的见物不见人的观点；批判了单纯依赖与伸手向上要的思想等。大规模的群众运动就一浪高一浪，一个高潮接一个高潮地发展起来。
    1958年，工厂建设规模扩大了，需要大量的各种各样的标准和非标准的机器设备。我们提出：本着自力更生的精神，依靠我们先建的一批辅助车间，制造部分非标准设备。但是有些人则缺乏信心，他们认为车间既无制造机床设备的专业知识，工人技术水平又低，不可能承制复杂的非标准设备，只能在设备安装中打“补钉”。显然，这是和大跃进的精神相违背的。我们批判了这种思想。提出了相反的口号是：“自己能干的自己干，自己能作的自己作”，“机器安一台开一台，不能让机床闲着”。这个口号调动了广大职工的积极性和主动性，掀起了一个人人动脑筋，人人动手的群众性的建厂运动。一年多来，我们在这方面取得的成绩是巨大的。制造了：非标准设备三千多台，标准机床六百零四台，电动机二千七百八十三台，各种工艺装备七十五万多件（套）。上述各种设备、工艺装备的劳动量假若请一个五千人的机械厂包作，也需要一年多时间，而且其中许多是大型的、复杂的、较为精密的设备。铸钢、铸铁两个车间，从炉子（电炉、冲天炉）、配砂、造型、清砂到机械化运输等全套设备中，80％以上是本厂自制的。现在这些设备都已经正常运转，生产出质量优良的拖拉机来。那种认为不能自我武装的谬论被事实驳倒了。此外，广大职工还和各施工单位一起投入了大搞基建的热潮。1958年以来，自己安装设备达一千一百多台，完成土建、安装的价值达二百六十万元。实践证明：一个新建厂，特别是大厂，由于建设过程较长，先建一批车间，后建一批车间，这是很自然的。当安装了一批设备之后，立即生产一些非标准设备，这是既需要又可能的事情。走自力更生的道路，这是我们的第一点体会。
    其次，在利用辅助生产车间进行自我武装的同时，按照建厂的基本程序，在基本生产车间实行了“三边”方针（边土建、边安装、边调整生产）。各厂房土建还没有结束，安装工程就交叉施工；很多车间在仅安装好少数设备的情况下，便采取按设计的工艺和临时生产相结合的方法，提前一年，于去年“八一”生产出第一台拖拉机，到交工验收时已经出产了九百零二台。今年4月，还集中地生产了四百台发动机支援农村水利建设。6月，围绕建筑安装交叉进行开展群众运动，结果，上万台设备、数万套（件）工艺装备、千余种零件、数十个总成，仅短短三个月多一点的时间（原计划半年），就和基本建设差不多同时结束了，而且有60％以上的工序达到或超过了设计水平。这样就大大地赢得了时间，争取了速度。
    其三，在自己武装自己的生产过程中，我们曾开展了大闹技术革命和技术革新的群众运动，其结果，是大大地提高了劳动生产率，工具车间去年下半年，就实现了上万条革新建议，全车间达到月产千台时的水平。但是在基本生产车间则曾发生过激烈的争论，有人说：“在新建厂尤其是像拖拉机厂这样有先进设计、近代化设备的大工厂，不应当也不可能搞群众性的技术革新运动”。他们的理由是：这些工厂的技术是先进的，机器设备是新的，而工人的技术水平低，应当先学“走”而后学“跑”。这些说法看来似乎有道理，其实这是一种消极的观点；因为，一个工厂的建设从开始设计到投入生产，一般需要几年时间，而科学技术却是一刻不停的在发展着，何况再先进的设计也不可能一下就是完美无缺的呢？我们批判了这种消极观点。在建厂过程中，开展了群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动。在工艺改革方面仅发动机、燃料系统两个车间进行的有效改革就有四百九十四项。在产品设计上，不仅进行了一些个别的、简单的改革，而且进行了一些部件、总成革新的试验。事实证明，在党领导下工人阶级的智慧是无穷的，经过技术革新运动不仅克服了生产调整中的困难，而且还有出色的创造。比如：发动机上的起动机，是一个主要的总成，经过三结合小组四次改革，在保证性能的前提下，简化了机构（由二百十一种四百零二个零件减少到一百四十四种二百九十一个零件），减轻了重量（由八十公斤减少到六十公斤），可减少40％的劳动量，可节省三十多台加工机床。经过半年多的使用试验，证明性能良好，作好生产准备后即可投入生产。当然，一个在建厂和生产调整中的新厂，他应当学好设计的技术资料（包括产品的和工艺的），要切实的学懂它、掌握它；在职工中树立明确的贯彻工艺，按技术规程办事的观念。但是这并不等于不能和不应当“革”。那种把“学”与“革”绝对对立起来的形而上学的观点，显然是错误的。
    其四，采取了实践中教学、快速培训徒工的方法。人是社会生产力中决定性的因素，是最宝贵的财富。一个新建厂如何迅速地培养一支既有社会主义觉悟，又有一定的文化技术水平的工人队伍，是一项比盖厂房安机器更重要的任务。去年我厂集结的一万多工人中，绝大多数是直接来自农村的农民。面对着这样的情况，我们采取了与生产实践相结合快速培训的方法，打破了徒工必须经过技工学校训练二、三年才能出师的迷信。在培训徒工中首先加强政治教育，强调政治挂帅，采用理论与实践相结合，课堂教学与机床操作相结合，成班培训与个别传授相结合，以及师带徒、老带新、徒带徒的连锁教学法，掀起了以快速培训徒工为中心的全体职工的教学运动，开展了优秀师傅、优秀徒工教学评比竞赛的活动，这样作效果很好，很多徒工，是迅速地学会了必须学的东西，掌握了基本的操作技术。
    总之，由于贯彻执行了总路线，坚持了大搞群众运动的方法，建厂速度是加快了，投资是节省了。这些成就是党的领导、是广大职工沿着党所指出的方向大跃进大创造的结果。同时，广大职工在一系列运动的实践中也自己教育了自己，提高了社会主义觉悟，树立了以厂为家的主人翁思想，初步地建立了生产秩序。这些铁的事实，对于右倾机会主义分子的反对党的领导，反对总路线，反对在工厂企业中大搞群众运动的谬论，是最有力的驳斥。现在，我们正满怀信心百倍努力地为实现党和毛主席提出的农业机械化的伟大号召而奋斗。
