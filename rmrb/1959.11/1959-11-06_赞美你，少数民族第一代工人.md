Praise You, The First Generation of Minority Workers
By Our Correspondents Zhao Qi and Jing Ming

At the National Hero Conference, there were over two hundred representatives wearing brightly colored ethnic costumes. They are the first generation of minority workers, a rising force in our country's working class ranks. They come from the grasslands and deserts where large industrial bases are being built, and from the deep mountains and plateaus where the roar of machines has just begun to sound. The sons and daughters of nomadic peoples are now skilled at operating blast furnaces and drilling rigs; peasants for generations have become experts beside machine tools; yesterday's serfs and slaves are today members of the national leadership class... In them, a new national spirit is radiating dazzling brilliance!

Huer Bao Yin from Baotou Steel and Ka Yixia from Karamay only stepped into the threshold of modern industry in 1958. Compared with the old heroes at the National Hero Conference, they are considered younger brothers and sisters. However, they have already begun to show their talents in the Great Leap Forward. Looking back on their growth, they always passionately talk about the nurturing of the Party and the warm assistance of their Han Chinese elder brothers and sisters.

Baotou Steel, is the first large-scale iron and steel base established by the state in a minority area, and also the cradle for cultivating modern minority workers. Huer Bao Yin used to be a model horse feeder. The Party sent him to Baotou Steel Technical School, allowing the Mongolian students to choose any type of work they wished after graduation. However, Huer Bao Yin did not pick and choose, determined to go to the Bayan Obo mine to be a rock drill operator. He thought, "Operating a rock drill in an open-pit mine means enduring wind and sun all year round. The temperature is around minus forty degrees Celsius in the coldest times. This work is very heavy and is the first important procedure in the entire iron ore area. I am a Party member and should go to this most difficult and most needed position." Bayan Obo is the treasure mountain in Mongolian legends, and opening up the mountain to extract treasures is the long-cherished wish of the Mongolian people. Huer Bao Yin came to the mine with a burning heart. The Han Chinese master workers from Anshan Steel welcomed him, cared for him, and taught him theory and operation; he also taught the masters to speak Mongolian. Bayan Obo is constantly changing. Large buildings have replaced yurts, new machinery has increased, production is developing, and there is a shortage of technical personnel everywhere. Huer Bao Yin always had books in hand every day, studying hard late into the night after work. On cold and snowy nights, in order to study a difficult problem, he would brave the wind and snow and walk a long way to the master's home. He studied diligently and quickly became a skilled rock drill operator, creating a high record of surpassing the quota by 25% per shift.

Ka Yixia is a young Kazakh girl. At the age of four or five, her mother put her on horseback to graze cattle and sheep for the herd owners. In this way, she spent her wandering childhood in the herds. After liberation, her father became a worker in the Karamay Oil Storage Team, and her sheep-herding brother became a technician in the drilling team. Ka Yixia heard so many moving stories from her brother. The Gobi Desert, towering drilling towers, brown oil rivers, and the starry lights of the mining area... were woven into a beautiful picture in her heart. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, batches of women poured onto the industrial front. The sixteen-year-old Ka Yixia hid her red scarf and went to the place she had longed for to sign up. She was tall and exaggerated her age by two years and was accepted. Since then, the red scarf has become the standard-bearer of the "March 8th" Drilling Team, and she has been rated as a model of the Karamay Mining Area three times in a year. Ka Yixia will never forget the friendship of the Han Chinese elder sisters in the team. The elder sisters taught her the techniques hand-in-hand and took care of her food, clothing, and daily life like relatives. On July 5 this year, when Ka Yixia operated independently for the first time, the captain and technical instructor came to her side. Seeing that her hands were trembling slightly, they encouraged her with concern: Be bold and do it. As long as you are bold and careful, there will be no mistakes. With the support of her elder sisters, Ka Yixia successfully passed one test after another and became the standard-bearer of high-yield and high-quality in the entire mining area.

The first generation of minority workers cultivated by the Party has lofty aspirations. They know that to completely eliminate backwardness and poverty, they cannot rely solely on the help of the state and the Han Chinese elder brothers and sisters, but must work hard themselves. In August last year, Pan Bingying, a Zhuang ethnic farmer from Guangxi, carried a hoe and a shoulder pole to open an asbestos mine. She had a beautiful ideal at the time: Our Longsheng mountain area has no industry, we must make machines roar all over the place! It is difficult to start any career. When she first arrived at the mine, there were only eight partners. Everyone lived in small shacks built by themselves and ate rice cooked in a single clay pot. She used wood instead of steel drills to mine, she was the hero who first created the efficient bamboo chute for soil removal and stone transportation at the mine, and the first female hero to learn to drill and blast. She has been rated as a pacesetter in the mining area seven times. In just one year, the number of workers from the Miao, Yao, Dong, Li, Zhuang, and Han ethnic groups in the asbestos mine has increased to more than 270, eight buildings have replaced the small shack, three large canteens have replaced the small clay pots of the past, and the mining area is covered with iron cableways, with trucks and rubber-wheeled vehicles coming and going.

In the Great Leap Forward, thousands of factories and mines that appeared in minority areas were established from scratch, from small to large, in this way. The first generation of workers created the first batch of factories and mines, and the first batch of factories and mines nurtured more ethnic workers. In July last year, Luo Wangqing, a Miao farmer in his twenties from Qiandongnan, Guizhou, heard that a coal factory had been established near his hometown. This good news made him jump for joy. The Miao people have used firewood for cooking for generations. Setting up a factory means not only having coal for cooking but also being able to smelt iron and steel. Luo Wangqing secretly packed his bedding and went straight to the coal factory without telling his parents. The sudden disappearance of his son made his parents anxiously searching around the village. When they found out what had happened, the old couple smiled happily. It turned out that they had the same thoughts as their son and praised him for doing a good job. Luo Wangqing, who had never touched coal before, was full of energy as soon as he arrived at the mine. When other workers got off work, he still carried pit props. If he didn't know how to set up pit props, he would insert an axe into his waist and learn from the Han Chinese master workers at any time. He loved the mine more than his own home and was reluctant to leave even on New Year's Eve. In one year, he mastered the complete set of techniques for rapid coal mining and setting up pit props, creating a high record of digging 1.7 meters in eight hours in a wellhead that was two meters high, 1.9 meters wide at the top, and 2.6 meters wide at the bottom, mining coal and setting up pit props by himself.

The hardworking and intelligent minority workers have opened a new page in the industrial history of minority areas. Although they have just grown up, they have shown the noble style of the working class's communism. Yang Deyi, a Communist Party member of the Buyi ethnic group, is a daring and capable pioneer. He broke through numerous difficulties and smelted the first furnace of steel in Guizhou Province. One evening in April last year, Yang Deyi heard the news as soon as he put down his luggage after returning from Kunming to observe and learn: The factory was preparing to smelt the first furnace of steel on May Day, but several experiments had failed. Yang Deyi was excited and anxious when he heard this. He thought, Guizhou has never produced iron and steel. How great it would be if we could smelt our own steel this time! He immediately accepted the task bravely. Some workers asked, "You can't even make steel without a furnace yet?" Yes! There are only seven days left until May Day, and there is not even enough time for drawing and designing. Yang Deyi sat all night, his mind churning with the scene of steelmaking he saw in Kunming. He thought: I am a foundry worker. If a large furnace is out of the question, can't I make a small furnace first? Before dawn, he rushed to the Han Chinese master worker Feng Zhiyin to discuss it. The two came to the sand casting workshop together, first pondering and drawing on the ground, and then kneeling to make sand molds. At this time, the factory director and the Party secretary sent another assistant. The three worked hard for four days and nights, and finally cast a small converter with pig iron. After repeated experiments, they smelted the first furnace of steel on the night of April 29. Yang Deyi said well: "Wherever there are difficulties, I will go there." In the factory, he often took the initiative to help brother workshops break through difficulties, making the factory's production soar. After he was transferred to the Guiyang Iron and Steel Medical Team as a "doctor," he went to more than a dozen factories to teach techniques, turning the tide and helping them cure "diseases" in production.

These highly conscious minority workers are the pride of the minority peoples. Dai Renli, a Communist Party member of the Yi ethnic group, dedicated his sincere heart and all his talents to the common cause of the various ethnic groups. Not long after Dai Renli returned to Yunnan from studying in Shanghai in 1956, he saw that the Miao brothers and sisters were constantly sending skirt patterns to the factory, requesting the supply of floral cloth. After accepting the task of producing ethnic floral cloth, he led three workers to carefully investigate the colors and patterns of the floral skirts in the Miao villages. When returning to the factory for testing, there was no workshop, so they vacated the washroom as a workshop; there was no equipment, so they found waste materials to assemble. After more than forty experiments failed, Dai Renli was so anxious that he could not sleep for several nights. Lying in bed, he felt like hundreds of eyes of the Miao brothers and sisters were watching him, thinking: It takes several months of production time for Miao women to embroider a floral skirt, and there is only a little more than a month left before spring plowing. According to Miao customs, they are waiting for floral skirts to wear! Under the continuous encouragement of the Party, he and the workers finally succeeded after more than 300 experiments, and printed more than 100,000 floral skirts. Later, the Dai, Jingpo, and Hani peoples also sent flower cloth samples one after another, requesting supply. These flower cloths had as many as five to eleven colors, and Dai Renli encountered the greatest difficulty of "color matching" of color-separated flower cloths. Soon, the entire factory launched a "seize the key" campaign, and the workers signed their names on the "key" big-character posters, pledging to break through the key. Dai Renli walked back and forth in front of the big-character posters, even forgetting to eat. The factory director and the Party secretary saw his thoughts and talked to him kindly. At this time, Dai Renli became bolder. He saw that no one had signed the last thirty-eight big-character posters to "attack," and he signed all of his names at once. These thirty-eight most difficult to solve keys included the "color matching" problem. With the support of the Party and the help of other workers, after more than twenty days of exploration, the biggest difficulty in color separation was broken through, and at the same time, 40% of the dyes and chemicals were saved, saving the country more than 100,000 yuan last year.

The heroic deeds are endless and inexhaustible. Today, the working people of Tibet have sent their own worker representatives for the first time in history. Not long ago, the Kawa Mountain, which was still cultivated with wooden sticks and wooden hoes, also selected heroes on the industrial front... Let us praise you, the first generation of minority workers; praise you, the heroes who represent more than 400,000 minority workers at the National Hero Conference! You were born in the cradle of the socialist motherland, and you are growing rapidly in the torrent of the Great Leap Forward. The growth of your team has accelerated the historical process of the development of minority nationalities into socialist modern nations!

    赞美你，少数民族第一代工人
    本报记者　赵奇　竞明
    群英大会上，有两百多位穿戴着鲜艳的民族盛装的代表。他们是少数民族第一代工人，是我们祖国工人阶级行列里后起的劲旅。他们，从正在建设大工业基地的草原和戈壁上来，从刚刚响起机器吼声的深山和高原上来。游牧民族的子弟，现在是驾驭高炉、钻塔的能手；祖祖辈辈的庄稼汉，变成机床旁边的内行；昨天的农奴和奴隶，今天做了国家领导阶级的成员……。在他们身上，新的民族精神正放射出夺目的光华！
    来自包钢的胡尔宝音和克拉玛依的卡一霞，1958年才跨进现代化工业的门槛。和群英会上的老英雄相比，算是小兄弟。但是，他们在大跃进中已初显身手。他们回顾自己的成长，总会激情地谈起党的抚育，和汉族老大哥亲切的扶助。
    包钢，是国家在少数民族地区建立的第一个大型钢铁基地，也是培养少数民族现代工人的摇篮。胡尔宝音过去是个喂马的模范，党把他送进了包钢技校，让他们蒙古族学员结业后，按自己的意愿去选择任何一个工种。可是，胡尔宝音不挑不拣，一心要上白云鄂博矿山做个穿孔机手。他想：“在露天矿山操纵穿孔机，整年要经受风吹日晒，最冷的时候气温在零下四十度左右。这个劳动很繁重，是整个铁矿区的第一道重要工序。我是党员，应该到这个最艰苦最需要人的岗位上去。”白云鄂博，是蒙古民族传说中的宝山，开山采宝是蒙族人民多少年来的心愿。胡尔宝音怀着一颗炽热的心，来到了矿山。从鞍钢来的汉族老师傅欢迎他，关心他，教他理论和操作；他也教师傅学蒙古话。白云鄂博不断在变化，大片楼房代替了蒙古包，新的机械增多了，生产在发展，到处缺少技术人才。胡尔宝音每天书本不离身，下工之后苦学到深夜，在寒风凛冽、大雪纷飞的夜晚，他为了研究一个难题，便冒着风雪，走很远的路到师傅家里去。他勤学苦练，很快成为熟练的穿孔机手，创造了台班进尺超过指标25％的高纪录。
    卡一霞，是个年轻的哈萨克姑娘。四、五岁上就被妈妈放在马背上，一起去为牧主放牧牛羊。就这样，她在畜群里度过了漂游不定的童年时代。解放以后，她父亲当上克拉玛依储油队的工人，牧羊的哥哥成为钻井队的技术员。卡一霞从哥哥那里听到了多少动人的故事。戈壁滩、高耸入云的钻塔、褐色的油河、矿区密如繁星的灯光……在她的心里交织成一幅瑰丽的图画。1958年大跃进，成批妇女涌上工业战线，十六岁的小卡一霞藏起自己的红领巾，到向往已久的地方去报名。她个儿高，多报了两岁，就被录取了。从此，红领巾变成“三八”钻井队的红旗手，一年当中三次被评为克拉玛依矿区的模范。卡一霞永远忘不了队里汉族大姐的情谊。大姐们手把着手教给技术，像亲人一样关照着她的衣食起居。今年7月5日，卡一霞第一次独立操作的时候，队长和技术指导都来到她的身边，看见她两手有些发颤，便关切地鼓励：放开胆子干，只要胆大心细，就不会出差错。卡一霞在大姐们的支持下，顺利地通过了一次又一次的考验，成为全矿区高产优质的旗手。
    党培养出来的少数民族第一代工人，志气豪壮。他们知道，要彻底消除落后和贫困，不能单靠国家和汉族老大哥的帮助，还得自己努力地干。去年8月，广西僮族农家姑娘潘炳英，扛起锄头扁担去开石棉矿。她当时就怀着一个美好的理想：我们龙胜山区没有工业，一定要叫它机器遍地响！万种事业开头难，她初到矿山的时候，一共才有八个伙伴，大家挤住在自己搭盖的小工棚里，合吃一个砂罐煮的饭，她用过木头代替钢钎撬矿，她是矿上首创竹滑道高效排土运石的功臣，第一个学会打眼放炮的女英雄，七次被矿区评为标兵。只不过一年光景，石棉矿上的苗、瑶、侗、黎、僮、汉族工人增加到二百七十多名，八幢楼房代替了那座小工棚，三个大食堂代替了过去的小瓦罐，矿区遍布铁索道，汽车胶轮车来来往往。
    在大跃进中，少数民族地区出现的千万个厂矿，就是这样从无到有、从小到大地建立起来。第一代工人开创了第一批工矿，第一批工矿又培育着更多的民族工人。去年7月，贵州黔东南二十多岁的苗族庄稼汉罗望青，打听到家乡附近办起了煤厂，这喜讯使他高兴得跳起来。苗家祖祖辈辈都是用柴火烧饭，办起工厂不光是有煤煮饭，还能炼铁炼钢。罗望青瞒着父母，悄悄背起铺盖卷，直奔煤厂而去。儿子突然失踪，急得父母在寨子周围打转，等到把下落打听清楚，老夫妇眉开眼笑了，原来他们和儿子的心思一样，夸奖他干得好。从来没有摸过煤炭的罗望青，一到矿井浑身是劲，别的工人下班了，他还要背运坑木；不会架坑木，就插把斧头在腰上，随时向汉族师傅学。他爱矿井胜过自己的家，大年三十夜晚也舍不得离开。一年时间，他就掌握了快速挖煤和架设坑木的全套技术，在高两米、上宽一米九、下宽二米六的井口里，自己挖煤，自己架坑木，创造了八小时挖进一米七的高纪录。
    勤劳智慧的少数民族工人，揭开了民族地区工业历史新的一页。他们虽然刚刚成长起来，已经表现了工人阶级共产主义的崇高风格。布依族共产党员杨德炎，就是一个敢想敢干的闯将，他冲破重重困难，炼出了贵州省的第一炉钢水。去年4月的一个傍晚，杨德炎从昆明观摩学习回来，刚放下行李便听到消息：厂里准备在“五一”节炼出第一炉钢，但是几次试验都失败了。杨德炎听了又兴奋又焦急，他想：贵州从来不产钢铁，要是这一回炼出自己的钢来，那该多好！他立即勇敢地接受了任务。有的工人问：“连炉子还没影子，你炼得出钢？”是啊！离“五一”只七天了，光是绘图设计也来不及。杨德炎整整坐了一夜，脑子里翻腾着在昆明看到的炼钢的景象，他想：我是个铸造工人，大炉子没指望，先整它个小炉子不行吗？没等天亮，他就匆忙去找汉族师傅冯志银商量。两人一起来到翻砂车间，先在地上揣摩着画图，然后跪着做沙模，这时，厂长和党委书记又派来一个助手，三人连着苦战了整整四个昼夜，终于用生铁水铸成一座小转炉。他们经过反复的试验，在4月29日夜里炼出了第一炉钢水。杨德炎说得好：“哪里有困难，我就到哪里去。”他在厂里，经常主动帮助兄弟车间突破难关，使全厂的生产扶摇直上。他调到贵阳钢铁医疗队当“医生”之后，曾经到十多个工厂传授技术，妙手回春，帮他们医治生产中的“疾病”。
    这些具有高度觉悟的少数民族工人，是少数民族人民的骄傲。彝族共产党员戴仁理，把他赤诚的心，和他的全部才智，贡献给各族人民的共同事业。戴仁理1956年从上海学习回到云南不久，便看到苗族弟兄不断向厂里寄来花裙样子，要求供应花布。他接受生产民族花布的任务后，带领三个工人，翻山越岭到苗乡仔细调查了花裙的色彩和图案。回厂试验的时候，没有车间，便腾出洗脸房子当车间；没有设备，便找来废料装配。试验四十多次都没有成功，戴仁理焦急得几个晚上睡不着觉，躺到床上，就像苗族弟兄几百只眼睛望着他，心想：苗家妇女为了绣一条花裙，需要占去几个月的生产时间，离春耕只有一个多月了，按照苗家风俗，她们正等着花裙穿哩！在党的不断鼓励下，他和工人们经过三百多次试验，终于成功，赶印出花裙十万多条。以后，傣、景颇、哈尼等民族人民也纷纷寄来花布样品，要求供应。这些花布的颜色多达五种到十一种，戴仁理又遇到套色花布“搭色”的最大难关。不久，全厂掀起了“抢关键”运动，工人们纷纷在“关键”大字报上签下自己的名字，包破关键。戴仁理在大字报面前走来走去，连饭也忘了去吃，厂长和党委书记看出了他的心思，亲切地和他交谈。这时，戴仁理的胆子更壮了，他看到最后留下的三十八张大字报没有人签字“包攻”，他一下全部签上了自己的名字。这三十八个最难解决的关键，就包括了“搭色”问题。在党的支持和其他工人的帮助下，经过二十多天摸索，套色中的最大难关突破了，同时还节约了染化料40％，去年为国家节省下十万多元。
    英雄的业迹说不完、写不尽。今天，西藏的劳动人民在历史上第一次派来自己的工人代表，不久以前还用木棒、木锄耕作的佧佤山，也选出了工业战线上的英雄……。让我们赞美你，少数民族第一代工人；赞美你，群英会上代表四十多万少数民族工人的英雄！你们在社会主义祖国的摇篮里诞生，在大跃进的洪流中飞速成长，你们队伍的壮大，加速了少数民族发展成为社会主义的现代民族的历史行程！
