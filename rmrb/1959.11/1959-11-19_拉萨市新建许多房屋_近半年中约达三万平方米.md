Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa. Lhasa City has constructed and is about to complete approximately 30,000 square meters of new housing in the last half year.

　　In recent months, a new area of silver-gray buildings has appeared west of the Potala Palace, where the construction department and the Tibet Transportation Department have built dormitories and factories. In the western suburbs, after completing the Lhasa Hydrological Station and Meteorological Observatory, workers are now building the first nursery in the Tibetan Plateau. Many auxiliary buildings have been added around the office building of the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region, and the newly built spacious club has already opened.

　　Restoration and new construction are proceeding simultaneously. The cultural relics and historic sites such as the Jokhang Temple and Norbulingka, which were damaged by the rebel bandits, have long been restored. The mosque, which was burned down by the rebel bandits, has been rebuilt on the ruins. The restored Lhasa People's Cinema has become one of the main entertainment venues for the citizens.
