Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: Minority representatives attending the National "Heroes' Meeting," in their speeches at the conference over the past few days, enthusiastically praised the great economic development that the Party's General Line has brought to minority areas across the country, and reported on the heroic deeds they have created in the Great Leap Forward.

A total of two hundred and seventy-three minority representatives are participating in this "Heroes' Meeting," coming from twenty-three nationalities, including Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Uyghur, Miao, Yi, Zhuang, Buyi, and Korean. The number of representatives has increased by 36% compared to the representatives who attended the 1956 National Advanced Producers Conference. The laboring people of Tibet, who were liberated from the serf system, have also sent their outstanding sons and daughters to participate in this conference. This situation is a strong testament to the great economic development in minority areas.

With the increasing development of industrial construction in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, a large number of minority brothers and sisters have joined the ranks of China's working class. Ahe Niyazi, the tunneling team leader of the Liudaowan Coal Mine, said in his speech that his tunneling team now has thirty-one Uyghur, Hui, and Han workers, including eleven who joined the coal mine production and construction in the Great Leap Forward of 1958. Since its establishment in 1956, the team has overfulfilled the state plan by 30% to 40% every year and has been an advanced collective in the mine. In this year's continuing Great Leap Forward, they have continuously won excellent red flags, always at the forefront of the mine. Ahe Niyazi said that all the workers in his team are now participating in cultural and technical studies, preparing to welcome a greater surge in production and construction. The workers' slogan of assurance is: "Eliminate illiteracy in '59, be able to read documents and write letters, send heartfelt words to Beijing!"

Buren, Deputy Director of the Hailar Dairy Factory in Inner Mongolia, introduced that Inner Mongolia is an important animal husbandry base in China, but before liberation, there was not a single dairy processing plant. A large amount of milk from herders could not be used, and sometimes it would even spoil. Now, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has newly built fifty-six dairy processing plants and many livestock product processing plants, and the income of the herders has greatly increased by selling milk to the processing plants. From 1953 to 1958, the income of herders in the whole autonomous region from selling milk could roughly buy 100,000 cattle. The broad masses of herders gratefully thank the Party and Chairman Mao for developing the dairy processing industry for them. Buren said that the Hailar Dairy Factory he leads, after years of development, especially since the Great Leap Forward, has increased the number of workers of all nationalities by eleven times compared to the initial construction of the factory, and the output has increased by thirteen times.

Dai Renli, an Yi technician at the Yunnan Printing and Dyeing Factory, went to work in a bathhouse at the age of seven before liberation. At that time, he worked twelve hours a day and was beaten and starved all day long. After liberation, the Party first sent him to a workers' training class to study, and later sent him to Shanghai to learn printing and dyeing technology. When he finished his studies in 1956, he not only became a technical worker with a seventh-grade skill level, but also gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Dai Renli introduced in a written speech that soon after he finished his studies and returned to the factory, he immediately responded to the Party's call for increasing production and practicing economy, and worked with the workers to trial-produce "national minority cloth." At that time, they used irons instead of drying cylinders because they didn’t have them, and used benches with light bulbs instead of photosensitive masks. After more than 300 experiments, they finally printed "national minority cloth" that was very popular among the local minority brothers and sisters. This year, especially after the publication of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, he was even more encouraged. Not long ago, after several days and nights of exploration and experimentation, he finally used various methods to make twenty-one kinds of pigments, such as peach red, solving the factory's difficulty of insufficient dye varieties. Four kinds of new fabrics made with the new dyes he had successfully tested were selected as national samples for National Day celebration. This daring and capable minority technician said boldly in his speech: "As long as we resolutely listen to the Party and closely rely on the masses, we can create anything."

Liu Qingshan, a Zhuang worker at the Nanning People's Printing Factory in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, who relied on doing odd jobs and selling newspapers from the age of fourteen before liberation, is now a technical innovation expert on the industrial front in Nanning. He introduced to more than 6,000 representatives at the "Heroes' Meeting" that since this year, he and the workers in his group have realized five technical innovations and created three new operating methods, which have increased work efficiency by two to fifteen times. He guaranteed in his speech: "I will continue to learn humbly and always be a promoter of the Great Leap Forward."

Wang Jinyu, the leader of the coal mining team of the Jianjing Company of the Shitanjing Coal Mine in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, who went down the mine to dig coal at the age of thirteen, said excitedly at the conference: "It was something I dared not even dream of in the old society that a poor Hui man like me, whose ancestors have been poor for generations, could participate in today's conference." Wang Jinyu's coal mining team has overfulfilled its production tasks every year since liberation, and there have been no production accidents for seven years. He himself has been rated as a production model and advanced producer nine times. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, Wang Jinyu took the lead in going to the desolate mountain gullies to open up mountains and build new coal wells, making many contributions. Recently, in response to the fighting call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, their coal mining team has worked hard and skillfully, and the coal mining volume in August exceeded the production plan by 50%, and in September it increased by half compared with August.

Luo Dong (Zhuang), the 71-year-old director of the Edible Miscellaneous Goods Warehouse in Yulin County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, who joined the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in 1929, has made important contributions to the Party and the country in his ordinary warehouse management work for ten years. Luo Dong said in a written speech that he was already 61 years old when he was transferred to the commercial front after liberation. At that time, he could not use an abacus or keep accounts, so he put on his reading glasses and started learning from scratch. Some young comrades who had just joined the revolution said that he was a veteran cadre of the Long March, with great merits and hard work, and should be an official of some kind. He told them that all revolutionaries are servants of the people; he told them that managing oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar is also managing national affairs and is a glorious post for serving the people. In the Great Leap Forward, although he was 70 years old, he still fought alongside the staff day and night, drying and transporting goods in the hot sun, and inspecting the warehouse regardless of wind and rain, so that their warehouse quickly became an advanced warehouse with "four no's." This old revolutionary said excitedly in his speech: "Seventy-one years old is not old, I will race against every second for the revolution. I will contribute all my remaining strength to repay our great Party."

    少数民族地区经济建设大发展
    各民族代表在群英会上热情歌颂总路线
    新华社1日讯　出席全国“群英会”的少数民族代表，在几天来的大会发言中，热烈地歌颂了党的总路线给全国少数民族地区带来的经济建设大发展，汇报了他们在大跃进中创立的英雄事迹。
    参加这次“群英会”的少数民族代表共有二百七十三人，他们来自蒙古、回、藏、维吾尔、苗、彝、僮、布依、朝鲜等二十三个民族。代表人数比出席1956年全国先进生产者代表会议的代表增加了36％。从农奴制度下获得了解放的西藏劳动人民，也选派他们的优秀儿女参加了这次大会。这个情况是少数民族地区经济大发展的有力旁证。
    随着新疆维吾尔自治区工业建设的日益发展，大批少数民族兄弟涌进了我国工人阶级的行列。六道湾煤矿掘进队长阿合尼牙孜在发言中说，他所领导的掘进队现在有维吾尔族、回族和汉族工人三十一人，其中在1958年大跃进中参加煤矿生产建设的就有十一人。他们这个队从1956年成立以来，年年超额30％到40％完成国家计划，是全矿历年的先进集体。在今年的继续大跃进中，他们又连续获得优秀红旗，始终走在全矿的最前列。阿合尼牙孜说，现在他们全队工人都参加了文化技术学习，准备迎接更大的生产建设高潮。工人们的保证口号是：“59年扫除文盲，会看文件会写信，知心话儿捎北京！”
    内蒙古海拉尔市乳品厂副厂长布仁介绍说，内蒙古是我国的重要畜产基地，解放前却没有一座乳品加工厂，牧民的大量牛奶不能利用，有时甚至白白地坏掉。现在，内蒙古自治区已经新建了五十六座乳品加工厂和许多畜产品加工厂，牧民们把牛奶卖给加工厂、收入大大增加。从1953年到1958年，全自治区牧民卖奶的收入，大约可以买十万只牛，广大牧民从心底感激党和毛主席为他们发展了乳品加工工业。布仁说，他所领导的海拉尔市乳品厂，经过历年的发展特别是大跃进以来，各民族工人比初建厂时增加了十一倍，产量增加了十三倍。
    云南印染厂彝族技术员戴仁理，解放前七岁进澡堂做工。那时他一天工作十二小时，整天挨打受饿。解放后，党先送他进工人训练班学习，后来又送他到上海学习印染技术，1956年学习结束，他不但成了一个具有七级工水平的技术工人，并且光荣地参加了中国共产党。戴仁理在书面发言中介绍说，他结束学习回到工厂不久，就立刻响应党的增产节约号召，同工人们一起试制“民族花布”。那时他们没有烘缸就用熨斗代替，没有感光罩就用板凳装上灯泡代替。先后经过三百多次的试验，他们终于印出了当地少数民族兄弟非常喜爱的“民族花布”。今年，特别是党的八届八中全会决议公布以后，他更加鼓足了干劲。不久前，他经过连续几天几夜的摸索试验，终于用各种办法制成桃红等二十一种颜料，解决了工厂染料品种不足的困难。工厂里用他试验成功的新染料染成的向国庆献礼的新花布，其中有四种被评选为全国样品。这位敢想敢干的少数民族技术员在发言中豪迈地说：“只要坚决听党的话，紧紧依靠群众，我们甚么都能够创造出来。”
    解放前从十四岁就依靠做小工和卖报度日的广西僮族自治区南宁市人民印刷厂僮族工人刘青山，现在成了南宁市工业战线上的技术革新能手。他在“群英会”上向六千多代表介绍说，今年以来，他同他们小组的工人一起，已经实现了五项技术革新，创造了三种新的操作方法，使工作效率提高两倍到十五倍。他在发言中保证说：“我要继续虚心学习，永远当大跃进的促进派。”
    十三岁就下井挖煤的宁夏回族自治区石炭井煤矿建井公司采煤组长王进玉在大会上激动地说：“像我这样一个祖祖辈辈的回族穷人，能够参加今天的大会，这在旧社会是做梦也不敢想的事情。”王进玉采煤小组解放后年年超额完成生产任务，七年没有发生过生产事故，他自己曾九次被评为生产模范和先进生产者。在大跃进的1958年，王进玉带头到荒无人烟的山沟开山劈岭，建立新煤井，立下了许多功绩。最近，他们采煤小组响应党的八届八中全会的战斗号召，苦干巧干，8月份的采煤量就超额50％完成生产计划，9月份又比8月份增长了半倍。
    1929年就参加了中国工农红军的七十一岁的广西僮族自治区玉林县食用杂品仓库主任罗东（僮族），十年来在平凡的仓库管理工作中又为党和国家作出了重要贡献。罗东在书面发言中说，解放后他转业到商业战线时已经六十一岁。那时他不会打算盘，不会记账，便戴起老花眼镜从头学起。有些刚参加革命的年轻同志说他是长征老干部，劳苦功高，应该当个什么“官”，他就告诉他们一切革命者都是人民的勤务员；告诉他们管理油盐酱醋也是管理国家大事，是为人民服务的光荣岗位。在大跃进中，他虽已七十高龄，仍然同职工们一起日夜苦战，在炎热的阳光下翻晒、搬运商品，不避风雨地检查仓库，因而使他们的仓库很快成为“四无”先进仓库。这位革命老人在发言中激动地说：“‘七十一岁不算老，为了革命争分秒’，我要贡献所有余力报答我们伟大的党。”
