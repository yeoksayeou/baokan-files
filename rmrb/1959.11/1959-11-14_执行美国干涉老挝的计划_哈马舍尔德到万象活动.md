Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 13th: Vientiane dispatch: Ignoring world public opinion, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld arrived in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, yesterday.

After the "Investigation Group on the Situation in Laos," illegally established by the United Nations Security Council, failed to provide any "evidence" sufficient to prove the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's "aggression" against Laos, Hammarskjöld personally went to Laos to conduct activities. World public opinion has pointed out that this is related to the United States' attempt to use the United Nations to further interfere in Laos. Hammarskjöld's activities in Laos will only make the situation worse.

Hammarskjöld tried his best to conceal the true purpose of his trip to Laos in a speech at Vientiane Airport. He said, "Laos faces problems that make the United Nations uneasy." He also believes that these problems are "the responsibility of the United Nations to solve first."

According to Western news agencies, Hammarskjöld also repeated the lies of US imperialism to distort the truth of the situation in Laos, portraying the situation caused by the Phoui Sananikone group of Laos, under the instigation of US imperialism, undermining the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements and launching a civil war, as a result of "Communist infiltration into Laos."

Lao Foreign Minister Phanya revealed in a speech at the airport a vicious conspiracy arranged by the United States, that is: through Hammarskjöld's activities in Laos, establish a permanent UN agency or representative in Laos, in order to prevent the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos from resuming its activities, and thereby block the only correct path to solving the Lao problem according to the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements. Phanya said, "Appointing a representative as a permanent observer (of the United Nations) is an ideal thing for Laos." He called Hammarskjöld's arrival in Laos, despite the criticism of just world opinion, a "courageous" act.

It is reported that Hammarskjöld plans to stay in Laos for a week. During this period, he will work with the American secretarial staff of the already disbanded UN "Investigation Group on the Situation in Laos."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 12th: Vientiane dispatch: The United Nations announced on the 11th the recall of the last two members of the illegal United Nations Security Council "Investigation Group on the Situation in Laos" remaining in Laos. Aoki Morio of Japan and Piccione of Italy will leave Laos this week and return to their respective capitals.

The recall of these two was announced after United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld announced on the 10th that he would depart for Laos on an "visit." It is also planned to appoint a so-called "Personal Representative of the Secretary-General" to reside in Vientiane.

Prior to this, there were signs that the United States attempted to leave some members of this "Investigation Group" to reside in Laos for a long time, in order to use this organization to prevent the resumption of the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, and further interfere in Laos' internal affairs. However, the activities of this "Investigation Group" in Laos have been notorious, and the report it submitted has become an international laughing stock. Therefore, some Western news agencies have promoted that some Western countries have requested the United Nations to establish a "semi-permanent UN monitoring mechanism" or "dispatch a permanent UN observer group" in Laos.

### 执行美国干涉老挝的计划  哈马舍尔德到万象活动

    执行美国干涉老挝的计划
    哈马舍尔德到万象活动
    新华社河内13日电　万象消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德不顾世界舆论的反对，在昨天到达老挝首都万象。
    在联合国安全理事会非法成立的“调查老挝局势小组委员会”未能提供任何足以证明越南民主共和国“侵略”老挝的“证据”以后，哈马舍尔德又亲自去老挝活动，世界舆论对这一点曾经指出，这同美国企图利用联合国来进一步干涉老挝的阴谋有关。哈马舍尔德到老挝活动，只会使局势更加恶化。
    哈马舍尔德在万象机场发表谈话极力掩饰他的老挝之行的真正目的。他说：“老挝面临使联合国感到不安的问题”。他并且认为这些问题是“联合国有责任首先加以解决的”。
    据西方通讯社报道，哈马舍尔德还重复美帝国主义的谰言来歪曲老挝局势的真相，把老挝培·萨纳尼空集团在美帝国主义指使下破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议而发动内战所造成的局势，说成是“共产党渗入老挝”的结果。
    老挝外交大臣班雅在机场上发表的讲话就透露了美国布置下的一个恶毒的阴谋，那就是：通过哈马舍尔德在老挝的活动，在老挝设立联合国的常设机构或代表，以便阻挠老挝国际委员会恢复活动，并从而堵塞根据日内瓦协议和万象协议来解决老挝问题这条唯一正确的道路。班雅说，“任命一个代表作为
  （联合国的）常设观察员，对老挝来说是一件理想的事情。”他把哈马舍尔德不顾世界公正舆论的指摘而来到老挝说成是“勇敢的”行动。
    据报道，哈马舍尔德打算在老挝活动一个星期。在这期间，他将同已经解散的联合国“调查老挝局势小组委员会”的美国秘书人员一起工作。
    新华社河内12日电　万象消息：联合国11日宣布召回非法的联合国安全理事会“老挝局势调查小组委员会”最后两个留在老挝的成员。日本的青木盛夫和意大利的皮契奥内将在本周离开老挝回到各自的首都。
    这两人是在联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德宣布10日动身前往老挝“访问”后宣布召回的。并且计划指派所谓“秘书长私人代表”驻在万象。
    在这以前，有迹象表明美国企图通过这个“小组委员会”留下一部分人来长期驻在老挝，以便利用这个组织来阻挡恢复老挝国际委员会的活动，并且进一步干涉老挝内政。但是，这个“小组委员会”在老挝的活动已经声名狼籍，它提出的报告已经成为国际上的笑柄。于是西方一些通讯社就宣传说，一些西方国家要求联合国在老挝设立“半永久性的联合国监视机构”，或者“派遣一个联合国常驻观察小组”。
