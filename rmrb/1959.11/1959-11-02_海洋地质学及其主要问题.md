Marine Geology and Its Main Problems
    Liang Yuanbo
    Marine Geology is a Cutting-Edge Science
    Marine geology is a cutting-edge science, but it is not mysterious. Navigators and fishermen in China's Song and Yuan dynasties already knew how to "use long ropes to lower hooks, sink them to the seabed to collect mud, and estimate the position by looking at the mud quality, or lower lead weights to measure the depth of the water." This is the preliminary knowledge of marine geology. It is generally believed that modern marine geology was founded and theoretically based by Soviet marine geologist Professor M.B. Klenova at the 17th International Geological Congress in 1937. From that time on, marine geology was separated from the two sciences of oceanography and geology, and became a science with independent research goals and methods. Although its existence has only been a short twenty years, it has grown rapidly due to its important significance to production and national defense, and also because, like other marginal sciences, it can absorb various nutrients from neighboring sciences. Modern marine geology studies the morphology of coasts and seabeds, providing data for coastal engineering and navigation and transportation; it studies the composition of bottom sediments and sedimentary processes, providing data for fishing, marine biology, and sedimentary petrology research; it studies seabed mineralization and geological structures, providing data for the development of seabed resources and the elucidation of crustal structure. Especially the last point, if we study geotectonics and are completely ignorant of the seabed crustal structure that occupies two-thirds of the Earth's surface, then our knowledge of geotectonics will be extremely one-sided. It can be seen that the research of marine geology is of great significance to both production practice and theoretical exploration, and it has become one of the indispensable research projects for modern coastal great powers.
    Morphology of Coasts and Seabeds
    In recent decades, due to the research of French physicist Langevin on ultrasonic waves and the application of echo sounders, people's knowledge of coastal and seabed morphology has greatly increased. In the mid-seventeenth century, a Western scholar named Athanasius Kircher said: "Measuring the depth of the sea is as impossible as measuring the height of the sky." (1664) The great German natural scientist Humboldt also said: We know as little about the deep sea as we do about the upper atmosphere. At that time, relying solely on a few plumb-line depth data to judge the seabed morphology, it is not surprising to draw such conclusions. But since the invention of the echo sounder in the 1920s, the situation has been completely different. The use of echo sounders can not only detect the depth of the seabed, but also determine the composition and structure of the seabed according to the different reflection coefficients of various bottom sediments to incident acoustic energy. Therefore, the echo sounder has become one of the most powerful tools in marine geological research. Now we know that the complexity of seabed topography is no less than that of land topography. It has a certain impact on the current situation of small sea areas, the mechanical composition of bottom sediments, and the conditions for biological reproduction, and it is of greater significance for navigation. If we have sufficient depth data to compile detailed geomorphological maps of the underwater terrain along the coast, just like topographic maps on land, it will be of great help to navigation and transportation.
    The situation of the coast is similar. From the perspective of marine geology, the coast is merely a continuation of the seabed geological structure on the water surface, and is its outcrop on the water surface. The coast and seabed topography are extremely closely related, and they can be transformed into each other. For example, the remains of marine organisms found at Qixinggang outside Guangzhou indicate that this area was once part of the South China Sea. Therefore, only by looking at the coast and seabed together can we see the direction of coastal changes and development, and make coastal forecasts on this basis, so that we can choose the correct location when building ports, dikes, and defense works along the coast, and avoid losses due to coastal changes.
    In national defense, the importance of knowledge of coastal and seabed topography is even more significant. Before World War II, in order to prepare for submarine warfare, Germany conducted a detailed survey of the seabed topography and bottom sediment composition along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea, the Bay of Biscay, and all European countries; until 1944, before the collapse of the fascist regime, Germany continued to publish seabed geomorphological maps of the Irish Sea. As for naval battles in nearshore areas, coastal defense, and landing operations, the importance of knowledge of coastal and seabed topography is self-evident.
    Composition of Bottom Sediments and Sedimentary Processes
    If the morphology of the seabed and coast is of great significance to shipping and national defense, then it should be said that the issue of bottom sediment composition is of the greatest significance to fisheries. In fact, many of China's previous marine bottom sediment surveys were conducted in conjunction with fisheries surveys. Research results indicate that the swimming and resting areas of many fish species are related to the bottom sediment composition. The relationship between benthic organisms and bottom sediments is even closer. For example, oysters cannot grow on excessively hard, inclined, or excessively soft seabeds, because they will sink into the soft mud and be unable to extricate themselves. This is well understood by fishermen who raise oysters in coastal areas of China. In order to better grasp fishery resources and develop fishing, we must clearly understand the composition of the seabed and its distribution patterns.
    One of our most pressing tasks at present is to compile detailed bottom sediment maps of China's sea areas. Although echo sounders can provide general information on bottom sediment composition, the current method of studying bottom sediment composition is still a long-standing one, which is to use a dredge to directly extract a certain amount of bottom sediment from the seabed, and then perform various analyses in the laboratory on the survey ship or on shore – mechanical (particle size) analysis and chemical analysis, etc. Since the bottom sediment often contains biological components, biological research is often carried out on the bottom sediment.
    In recent years, in addition to studying the bottom sediment on the seabed surface, the sediments below the surface layer have also been studied. The lower layer of bottom sediment is the sediment of the past geological period, which reflects the conditions of a certain sea area in the past era. We know that many of the characteristics of sea areas are historical formations, and we must look for explanations from their past characteristics, otherwise we will not be able to understand them accurately. This requires the use of an instrument called a sampling tube, which can be inserted into the seabed to obtain a section of soil column of several centimeters, and then analyze and study it layer by layer. In order to obtain longer soil columns, sometimes impact or projection-type sampling tubes are used to obtain bottom sediment. The longest reported abroad is 200cm long soil columns. Sampling with soil columns is of particular importance for the study of sedimentary petrology. Many problems in sedimentary petrology are related to the deposition of sediments and their gradual transformation process. From the comparison of these two formations – modern sediments and sedimentary rocks – many problems of great significance in petrology can be solved. Therefore, the study of bottom sediment has great practical and theoretical significance.
    The representation method of bottom sediments has not yet been completely determined, and Western scholars' views on this issue are quite chaotic. Shepard (USA) has his own concept of bottom sediment composition, and Kuenen (Netherlands) has his own concept. Although they all use terms such as muddy sand and sandy mud, the definitions of these terms are not clearly defined, and are generally only based on the rather vague information from the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. In the Soviet Union, there are two different factions on this issue, namely the special sediment representation method proposed by Professor Klenova, and the particle size-material-genetic comprehensive representation method adopted by Bezrukov. At present, China generally adopts the former, that is, the percentage of the particle size less than 0.01 mm in the bottom sediment is used as the basis for classification. However, these two classification methods are not contradictory in fact, and we can add the material composition and genetic type of the sediment to the value of the particle size less than 0.01 mm.
    Seabed Mineralization and Geological Structure
    Seabed mineralization is a problem involving a wide range of aspects, including marine chemistry (the source, properties, and transfer of various elements in the marine environment and seawater medium), fluid dynamics (the transportation and accumulation of substances), physical oceanography (the mechanisms of pressure, temperature, and hydrogen ion concentration in mineralization), marine biology (the impact of various biological effects on mineralization), etc. This problem involves such a wide range that Western marine geologists simply shut up about this issue, and specialize in discussing the causes of submarine canyons and other issues that they are interested in.
    However, seabed mineralization is actually one of the very important issues for the national economy. The resources hidden in the seabed are basically unknown to us, but according to theoretical inferences, their value must be very considerable. Taking petroleum alone, according to the existing data, it is already worth our attention. For example, according to fishermen's reports, a large amount of combustible asphalt substances have been found on the coast south of the Zhoushan Islands and on the islands along the coast of Zhejiang, which indicates that petroleum may also be hidden in the coastal sea areas. Some scientists even believe that the seabed is the main camp for the production of petroleum. For example, the Soviet Union's extraction of petroleum on the seabed of the Caspian Sea and the Western countries' extraction of petroleum on the seabed of the Persian Gulf are well-known examples.
    Finally, let's talk about the geological structure of the seabed. This is a fundamental problem that reflects two different worldviews. Western marine geologists have always believed in the Kant-Laplace cosmogony, believing that the Earth has cooled down from heat, and Suess even proposed the theory of continuous shrinkage of the Earth. In recent years, in the Soviet Union, due to Academician Schmidt's proposed materialistic and rational theory of Earth formation, many scholars (such as K.K. Markov of Moscow University) believe that the Earth is not aging and shrinking, but on the contrary, is constantly being renewed due to the replenishment of radioactivity. The formation of the continent is one such embodiment. They believe that the granite continent is a formation that has segregated from the heavier bedrock, and that the seabed is only an area that is currently less variable and has not yet completely segregated out the granite continent. Based on this, it is necessary for us to re-evaluate the origin of the geological structure of the seabed area. For example, we can easily explain the problem of the origin of submarine canyons, which many marine geologists have spent a lot of space arguing fiercely about (this kind of submarine canyon is also developing on the continental slope off the east coast of Taiwan in our country), according to Schmidt's theory: that is, when the continent rises from the seabed area that has solidified on the surface, because its surface has solidified, and the interior is still constantly filling with segregated products, causing the continental slope to be subjected to transverse stress and produce cracks (bursts), and then various forces are used to carry out various types of "processing" (erosion, abrasion, gouging, etc.), forming the submarine canyons that we see today. Our experiments with clay (1959) confirmed that submarine canyons can be produced by the above situation.
    Many oceanographers pointed out that the development of oceanography initially focused on the description of marine geography, then focused on the research of marine biology, and now, interest in marine geology is growing.
    Under the correct leadership and care of the Party and the People's Government, China's marine geological cause has made great progress in recent years. The development of China's marine geological cause is also inseparable from the help of the Soviet Union. Soviet marine geologist Professor Zenkevich participated in the marine work conference held in Qingdao, China, at the beginning of this year and gave an academic report. Scientific and technological cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is increasingly strengthening.
    At present, marine geology is still a new science, and the research work of marine geology is also unfolding. For example, the last two problems mentioned above, namely the seabed mineralization and seabed geological structure problems, the currently available data are insufficient, and further investigation and exploration are needed. This year marks the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the work of marine geology must also make a great leap forward, and strive to reach advanced levels in the shortest possible time.

    海洋地质学及其主要问题
    梁元博
    海洋地质学是一门尖端科学
    海洋地质学是一门尖端科学，但是并不神秘。我国宋元时代的航海者和渔民已经懂得“用长绳下钩，沉至海底取泥，看泥质推定位置，或下铅锤，测水深浅”。这就是初步的海洋地质学知识。一般认为，现代的海洋地质学是苏联海洋地质学家M·B·克莲诺娃教授1937年在第十七届国际地质学大会上创立并从理论上加以奠基的。从那个时候起，海洋地质学就从海洋学和地质学这两门科学中划分出来，成为一门具有独立的研究目标和研究方法的科学。它的存在虽然只有二十多年短短的历史，但由于它对生产和国防事业具有重要的意义，又由于它和别的边缘科学一样，能够从相邻的科学中吸收多方面的养分，所以它迅速地成长壮大起来。现代的海洋地质学研究海岸和海底的形态，给海岸工程和航海运输事业提供资料；它研究底质成分和沉积作用，为渔捞、海洋生物和沉积岩石学的研究工作提供资料；研究海底成矿作用和地质结构，为开发海底宝藏和阐明地壳结构提供资料。尤其是最后一点，如果我们研究大地构造时，对于占有地球表面三分之二的海底地壳结构茫无所知，那末我们对于大地构造学的知识就是极其片面的。由此可见，海洋地质学的研究不论对于生产实践或是对于理论探讨都具有重要的意义，它已经成为现代濒海的强大国家所必不可少的研究项目之一。
    海岸和海底的形态
    近几十年内，由于法国物理学家郎之万对超声波的研究和对回声测深仪的应用，人们对于沿岸和海底形态的知识有了很大的增进。在十七世纪中叶，有一个名叫阿法纳西·基尔赫的西方学者还说过：“测量海深，同测量天高一样，都是不可能的。”（1664年）德国伟大的自然科学家洪保德也说过：我们对于深海的知识，正如对于大气高层的知识一样少。那时候仅仅靠着少数的铅锤测深资料来判断海底的形态，得出这样的结论也不奇怪。但是自从本世纪二十年代发明了回声测深仪之后，情形就完全不同了。利用回声测深仪不但能够探知海底的深度，还能够根据各种底质对入射声能反射系数的不同，来判断海底的成分和结构。所以回声测深仪已经成为海洋地质学研究中最有力的工具之一。现在我们知道，海底地形的复杂性并不亚于陆上的地形，它对小区的海流情况、底质机械成分和生物繁殖条件等都起着一定的影响，而对于航行的意义就更大。如果我们拥有充足的测深数据，把沿岸的水下地形编制成详细的地貌图，就像陆地上的地形图一样，这对于航海运输事业将会有很大的帮助。
    海岸的情况也相似。从海洋地质学的观点看来，海岸只不过是海底地质构造在水面上的延续部分，是它在水面上的露头。海岸和海底地形有着极其密切的关系，它们是可以互相转化的。例如在广州市郊外七星岗发现的海洋生物遗骸，表明这里过去曾经是中国南海的一部分。所以只有把海岸和海底联系起来看，才能看出海岸变动和发展的方向，并在这个基础上作出海岸预报，使在沿岸兴建港口、堤防和国防工事时能够选择正确的位置，不致因海岸变动而遭受损失。
    在国防事业上，海岸和海底地形知识的重要性就更为显著。在第二次世界大战以前，德国为了准备打潜艇战，曾经详细调查了地中海、比斯开湾和欧洲所有国家沿岸的海底地形和底质成分；直到1944年，在法西斯政权垮台以前，德国还在继续出版爱尔兰海的海底地貌图。至于在近岸区域进行海战、海岸的防守和登陆作战等等，那末海岸和海底地形知识的重要性，更是不必说了。
    底质成分和沉积作用
    如果说海底和海岸的形态对航运和国防事业具有重要的意义，那末应当说底质成分的问题和渔业有着最为重大的关系。事实上，我国以前的海洋底质调查，许多都是为配合渔业调查而进行的。研究结果指出，许多鱼类的游息区域都和底质成分有一定的关系。至于底栖生物和底质的关系则更为密切。例如，蚝（牡蛎）不能生长在过分坚硬、倾斜和过于松软的海底上，因为它会陷在软泥巴中不能自拔。这在我国沿海养殖牡蛎的渔民是了解得很清楚的。为了更好地掌握渔业资源和发展渔捞事业，我们必须清楚了解海的底质成分及其分布规律。
    目前我们的最迫切任务之一是编制我国海域的详细底质图。虽然回声测深仪可以提供底质成分的一般资料，但目前研究底质成分还是采用一个由来已久的方法，这就是利用挖泥器直接在海底上挖取一定数量的底质，然后在调查船上或岸上的实验室中加以各种分析——机械（粒度）分析和化学分析等等。由于底质中经常含有生物的成分，所以往往还要对底质进行生物学的研究。
    近年来除了研究海底表层的底质以外，还研究表层以下的沉积物。下层的底质是过去地质时期的沉积物，它反映着一定海区在以往时代所处的条件。我们知道，海区的特性有许多是一种历史的形成体，必须从它过去的特点来找寻解释，否则是无法精确了解的。这就需要借助于一种称为取样管的仪器，它能插入海底，取得若干厘米的一段底土柱，然后再逐层分析研究。为了取得较长的土柱，有时利用冲压式或利用发射式的取样管来获取底质。国外最长的有取得200cm长底土柱的报导。用底土柱取样，对于沉积岩石学的研究有特别重要的意义，许多沉积岩石学上的问题，都和沉积物的淀积及其逐渐转变的过程有关。从这两种形成物——现代沉积物和沉积岩——的比较中，可以解决许多在岩石学上有重大意义的问题。所以底质的研究，是有很大的实际意义和理论意义的。
    底质的表示法目前还没有完全确定下来，西方学者对这个问题的看法是相当混乱的。谢帕德（美国）有他自己对底质成分的概念，奎年（荷兰）又有他自己的概念。虽然他们都用泥质砂、砂质泥这些名称，但是这些名称的定义并没有明确的规定，一般只是根据美国海岸与大地测量局的相当含混的资料。在苏联，这个问题上有两个不同的派别，这就是克莲诺娃教授提出的专门沉积物表示法，和别兹鲁科夫采用的粒度——物质——成因综合表示法。目前我国一般是采用前者，即以小于零点零一毫米的粒级在底质中所占的百分比作为分类的根据。不过，这两种分类法其实并不矛盾，我们可以在小于零点零一毫米粒级的数值上加注沉积物的物质成分和成因类型。
    海底的成矿作用和地质结构
    海底成矿作用是一个牵涉面很广的问题，它涉及海洋化学（各种元素在海洋环境及海水介质内的来源、性状和转移情况）、流体动力学（物质的搬运和堆聚）、物理海洋学（压力、温度及氢离子浓度在成矿作用方面的机制）、海洋生物学（各种生物作用对成矿作用的影响）等等。这个问题牵涉这样广，西方的海洋地质学家对这个问题简直就闭口不谈，而专门去讨论他们感兴趣的海底峡谷成因等问题。
    但是，海底成矿作用其实是对国民经济非常重要的问题之一。海底蕴藏着的资源，基本上对我们还是一个未知数，但据理论上的推断，其数值一定是十分可观的。单以石油一项来说，按照已有的资料已经值得我们重视。例如根据渔民报矿，舟山群岛以南的海岸和浙江沿海的海岛发现有大量可燃的沥青物质，这表明了沿岸海区也可能蕴藏着石油，有些科学家根本就认为海底是石油产生的大本营。又如苏联在里海海底开采石油和西方国家在波斯湾海底采石油，都是很有名的例子。
    最后我们谈谈海底地质结构的问题。这是一个根本性质的问题，它反映着两种不同的世界观。西方的海洋地质学家一直是信奉着康德—拉普拉斯的宇宙成因见解，认为地球是由热变冷的，修斯更由此提出了地球不断皱缩的学说。而近年来在苏联，由于施密特院士提出了唯物主义的合理的地球形成学说，有许多学者（如莫斯科大学的K·K·马尔科夫）认为地球不但不是在衰老退缩中，相反，正由于放射能的补给而在不断更新着。大陆的形成就是这样的一种体现。他们认为花岗岩大陆是从较重的基岩分凝出来的一种形成体，而海底只不过是目前变动较少、还没有完全分凝出花岗岩大陆的区域。根据这点，我们有必要来重新估计海底区地质结构的成因。例如，许多海洋地质学家花费了很多篇幅争论得很厉害的海底峡谷成因问题（这种海底峡谷在我国台湾东岸的陆坡上也在发育着），我们可以很容易根据施密特的理论来加以解释：即这是大陆从表面已经凝固的海底区隆起时，因其表面已经凝结，而内部仍不断填充着分凝产物，致使陆坡部分受横向应力而产生裂痕（爆裂），其后再由各种营力加以各种不同类型的“加工”（侵蚀、磨蚀、刨刮等），形成了现时所见的海底峡谷。我们用粘土所做的实验（1959），证实了海底峡谷可以由上述情况产生。
    许多海洋学家指出，海洋学的发展是起初偏于重海洋地理学的描述，其后着重于海洋生物学的研究，而现在，则对海洋地质学的兴趣正在日益增长。
    我国的海洋地质事业，在党和人民政府的正确领导和关怀下，近年来有了很大的发展。我国海洋地质事业的发展，也是和苏联的帮助分不开的。苏联海洋地质学家曾科维奇教授今年年初参加了我国在青岛举行的海洋工作会议，并且作了学术报告。中苏两国的科学技术合作正在日益加强。
    目前，海洋地质学还是一门新的科学，海洋地质学的研究工作也正在展开。例如上面所述的最后两个问题，即海底成矿作用和海底地质构造问题，目前所拥有的资料是不充分的，还有待进一步的调查和探讨。今年正值伟大的国庆十周年，海洋地质学的工作也要来一个大跃进，为争取在最短时期内达到先进水平而努力。
