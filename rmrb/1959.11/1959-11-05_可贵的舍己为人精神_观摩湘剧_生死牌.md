The "Decree of Life and Death" is a universally recognized good play. Recently, the Hunan Provincial Xiang Opera Troupe performed this play in Beijing, and after processing and reorganization, the characters are more distinct than the original version, the theme is more prominent, and the scene processing is more concise and clear, making it even more touching.

This play tells the story of Huang Boxian, a magistrate of Hengshan County in the Ming Dynasty, who rebelled against General He's persecution in order to save the commoner woman Wang Yuhuan. General He relied on his power and influence as the adopted son of Yan Song, the treacherous prime minister of the Ming Dynasty. Huang Boxian was a low-ranking official in a position where he could not appeal. Therefore, when General He unleashed his tyrannical power, wanting to kill Wang Yuhuan with a borrowed knife and coerce Huang Boxian to follow evil and disregard human life, Huang Boxian, who upheld justice, fairness, and gratitude, had to rise up and resist. This constituted the play's escalating tension and tragic plot.

In the tortuous struggle, we saw the noble character of Huang Boxian, Huang Xiulan, Wang Yuhuan, Qiu Ping, and others, that spirit of self-sacrifice and courage to do what is right. This adaptation has newly enriched the spiritual outlook of these characters.

In the "Courtroom" scene, Huang Boxian appears as a magistrate with a sense of justice. General He attempts to subdue him, wanting him to obey, but Huang Boxian is calm in his heart, aware of Wang Yuhuan's injustice. General He roars in the courtroom, forcing him to use torture. He lifts the signature slip once and puts it down, then lifts it again and puts it down again. The second time is more resolute and forceful than the first, justified and confident. Whether to succumb to tyranny or adhere to justice, Huang Boxian's choice is to refuse General He's threats of torture through his actions and uphold justice. The actor's portrayal of Huang Boxian's emotional changes is meticulous, highlighting his upright character. No wonder Yuhuan calls him: parent official! In this brief ideological struggle of lifting the signature slip twice, Huang Boxian stands before the people as an image of upholding justice. Therefore, it is even more convincing when combined with his later knowledge that Yuhuan is the daughter of his benefactor, Wang Zhijian, and his intention to repay the kindness and save her is unified in his character of upholding justice. Huang Boxian's actions in the courtroom have transcended the limitations of the original's excessive emphasis on the idea of repaying kindness. The adaptors and actors have indeed unearthed more admirable qualities in Huang Boxian, which is reasonable and appropriate.

Huang Boxian understands his own situation; he wants to let Yuhuan escape, bearing the consequences himself. But Huang Boxian's plan cannot avoid harming his entire family. Here, Huang Xiulan and Qiu Ping, his two daughters, appear, both willing to die in place of Yuhuan to save her and protect the family. Although Yuhuan also desires to live, she does not want to harm others because of herself and requests to die. The three women compete fiercely, finally deciding who lives and who dies by drawing lots. These emotional changes are fully depicted in the two scenes, "Substitute Death" and "Drawing Lots." The spirit of self-sacrifice shines equally brightly in these three girls, making them admirable. After Huang Xiulan draws the death token, her farewell to Huang Boxian, and the "Sentencing" scene, the play makes a profound expression of the father and daughter's final endurance of grief and abandonment of personal feelings for the sake of righteousness. From Huang Boxian's several hesitations to write the death sentence to his fainting at the desk after making the final decision, it shows that Huang Boxian has experienced another enormous struggle in his spirit. This precisely demonstrates the growing strength of the people's morality of sacrificing oneself for justice in him. The farewell of the Huang family father and daughter signifies the eternal life of the spirit of upholding justice and self-sacrifice.

"The Execution Ground" is the final scene of the play, the climax of the tragedy. In this scene, the contradiction is pushed forward a step further, unfolding a face-to-face, close-quarters resistance struggle. At the time of execution, Wang's father arrives, the false prisoner is exposed, the two daughters rush over, and shout their grievances in unison. The original plot of the three daughters vying to confess to the death is changed to the three daughters shouting their grievances regardless of life and death, accusing General He. This is an active and positive stroke that conforms to the personalities of the three women. When General He becomes enraged and even more brutal, wanting to execute the three women on the spot, Huang Boxian stands up resolutely to stop him: "Wait! Huang Boxian stands on the execution ground, his hair standing on end. Who dares to despise the law of the land and unjustly execute innocent people!" These lines enrich and promote the characters' spirit of supporting justice and opposing evil. It seems that General He is showing his power, but in reality, the people's integrity fills the entire scene through the active accusations and struggles of the persecuted, penetrating the depths of every audience member's heart.

The appearance of Hai Rui turns the tragic encounter into a comedic ending. Hai Rui settles the matter, saving the kind, upright, just, and anti-evil forces people, and punishing General He. Like Bao Gong, he is a people-created image of supporting justice, reflecting the people's wishes at that time. The delightful comedic ending brings people firm confidence that justice will surely defeat feudal evil forces. From the fierce struggle reflected in the Xiang Opera "Decree of Life and Death," we deeply appreciate the noble spirit of self-sacrifice and the moral tradition of supporting justice and opposing evil of our ancient people.

    可贵的舍己为人精神
    ——观摩湘剧“生死牌”
    俞一
    “生死牌”是一个大家公认的好戏。最近湖南省湘剧团在京演出的这个戏，经过加工整理以后，比原来的本子的人物更鲜明，主题更突出，场面处理也更精炼明确，因此也更感人。
    这个戏是写明朝的一位衡山县令黄伯贤为救民女王玉环，反抗贺总兵迫害的故事。贺总兵依仗权势，是明朝奸相严嵩的干儿子。黄伯贤官卑职小，处在上告无门的处境。所以当贺总兵发起淫威，要借刀杀死王玉环，胁迫黄伯贤顺从邪恶、草菅人命的时候，这位持正义、秉公理、报恩义的黄伯贤，就不得不起来反抗。这样，就构成了这个戏节节紧张、步步迫人的尖锐冲突和悲剧情节。
    在曲折的斗争里，我们看到了黄伯贤、黄秀兰、王玉环、秋萍等人物身上的崇高品德，那种舍己为人、见义勇为的精神。这次改编，对这些人物的精神面貌，有了新的丰富。
    “公堂”一场，黄伯贤一出场就是一个具有正义感的县令。贺总兵企图压服他，要他顺从自己，可是黄伯贤心里是镇静的，他觉察了王玉环的冤枉。贺总兵暴啸公堂，迫他用刑，他一次提签放下，又一次提签再放下，第二次比第一次放的坚决有力，理直气壮。是慑服于淫威，还是坚持正义，黄伯贤的抉择是从行动上拒绝了贺总兵的威胁用刑，坚持了正义。演员对黄伯贤的这种情感变化，表现的细致入微，突出了他正直的性格。不愧玉环叫他一声：父母官！在这短促的两次提签的思想斗争中，黄伯贤是作为一个坚持正义的形象站在人们面前的。因此和后来他知道玉环是恩人王志坚的女儿，意欲报恩相救的思想结合起来，统一体现在他力持正义的品德中，就更令人信服了。黄伯贤在公堂的行动，已超脱了原本过多强调报恩思想的局限。改编者和演员，的确发掘了黄伯贤身上更加可敬的品质，是合情合理的。
    黄伯贤懂得他自己的处境，他想放玉环逃走，自担后祸。可是黄伯贤的打算并不能免于祸及全家。戏到这里，出现了黄秀兰、秋萍这两个女儿，她们都情愿自己去替死，以救玉环，以保全家。玉环虽也欲求生，但不愿因为自己祸及别人而要求死。三女相争不下，最后以抢板来定谁生谁死。她们的这种情感变化，在“替死”“抢板”两场戏中得到了充分的描绘。舍己为人的精神，同样在这三位女孩子身上光彩夺目，令人起敬。在黄秀兰夺到死牌之后，与黄伯贤相别，以及“判斩”一场，剧作对父女之间最后忍着悲痛，就大义而舍私情的情感，作到了深刻的表现。从黄伯贤判斩时几次不忍下笔，到他点朱笔而昏倒案上，表现了黄伯贤在精神上经历了再次巨大的斗争。这正显示了为正义舍己的那种人民道德的力量在他身上的成长。黄家父女的死别，意味着坚持正义、舍己为人精神的永生。
    “刑场”是全剧的最后一场，是悲剧的高潮。在这场戏里，把矛盾更向前推进了一步，展开了面对面的，短兵相接的反抗斗争。临刑之时，王父赶到，假犯被发觉，二女赶来，齐声喊冤。原本中三女争着认死的情节，改变成三女不顾生死齐喊冤，控诉贺总兵。这是合乎三女性格的积极的手笔。在贺总兵老羞成怒，更加凶残，要立斩三女的时候，黄伯贤站出来毅然阻止：“且慢！黄伯贤站法场怒发冲冠，有谁敢藐国法屈斩良善！”这些笔墨都使人物支持正义，反对邪恶的精神面貌，得到了丰富和发扬。看来，表面上是贺总兵在那里发威，实际上却是人民的浩然正气通过被迫害者的积极控诉和斗争，充溢了全场，深入到每个观众的心灵深处。
    海瑞的出现，使悲剧的遭遇转为喜剧的结尾。海瑞处决了这件事，救了善良、正直、主持正义，反抗恶势力的人们，惩办了贺总兵。他像包公一样，是人民心里创造的支持正义的形象，反映了当时人民的愿望。大快人心的喜剧结尾，给人们带来了正义一定战胜封建恶势力的坚定信心。从湘剧“生死牌”所反映的这一场激烈斗争中，我们深切地体会到我国古代人民舍己为人的高贵精神，和支持正义、反对邪恶的道德传统。
