    Sai He Help (Competition and Assistance)
    Zhang Ke
    The Zhu Village Production Team unconditionally helps the Yanli Production Team to advance together in production competitions. This is a noble communist style.
    Competition is an important method for us to promote the development of socialist undertakings. In the competition, everyone should strive for red flags, win first place, learn from and catch up with each other, and promote each other. This prompts people to more fully tap their potential and give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity. In the competition, exchanging experiences, learning from each other's strengths, and supporting each other can better exert collective wisdom and collective strength. However, this alone is not enough. When necessary, we must also extend a hand of friendship and give unconditional assistance to our competitors. Like the Zhu Village Production Team helping the Yanli Production Team to develop pig raising: when it was discovered that the competitor could not solve the problem of breeding pigs, they selected the best breeding pigs and sent them over; knowing that the opponent's sows were in heat and would become empty nests because there were no boars to mate with, they would rather have two fewer sows mated in their own team and immediately go to help the other party first.
    Our socialist labor competition is different from capitalist competition. In capitalist society, everything starts from the private interests of capitalists, squeezing out and attacking each other, engaging in deceit and trickery, harming others and benefiting oneself. The result is that the big fish eat the small fish, a few people benefit, and the majority suffer losses. Our competition is for the better development of socialist undertakings and for the common improvement of everyone's lives. Everyone's interests are consistent, and the goals of struggle are common. Therefore, in the competition, we must not only catch up with each other, but also support each other; we must not only have conditional cooperation, but also unconditional assistance.
    Does unconditional assistance violate the principle of equivalent exchange? Can the two not coexist? Of course not. Equivalent and mutually beneficial exchange is the socialist principle that we should currently abide by, and mutual assistance is the socialist spirit that we should promote. Only by combining the two well can our entire socialist cause develop comprehensively and rapidly. The fact is also true. Zhang Qiuxiang, a nationally famous cotton planting expert, spent a lot of time teaching her experience to others and enthusiastically helping others. Under her help and influence, many cotton planting groups have caught up with or exceeded her cotton yield. The more than 120,000 mu of "Qiuxiang fields" in Weinan County averaged more than 270 jin of ginned cotton per mu. From the perspective of her and her unit, there may be some "losses" in work, but the county's cotton has achieved a greater harvest. Compared with gains and losses, which is more conducive to the development of production? Moreover, some assistance, looked at in isolation, seems to be free, but from a comprehensive perspective, it is mutual assistance and mutual benefit. The Zhu Village Production Team helped the Yanli Team in raising pigs, but wasn't the Zhu Village Team also helped by other units when picking spring tea last year! Although this kind of assistance is not a direct help between the two, it is essentially a large-scale relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation. No unit can avoid asking for help from others in everything. Therefore, in cooperation, we must not only abide by the principle of mutual benefit and equivalence, but also advocate the communist style of enthusiastically helping others and advancing together, so as to promote the better and faster development of our socialist construction cause.

    朱村生产队在生产竞赛中无条件地帮助研里生产队共同前进，这是一种高尚的共产主义风格。
    竞赛是我们促进社会主义事业发展的一个重要方法。在竞赛中，大家都要争红旗，夺第一，你追我赶，互相促进，这就促使人们更加充分地挖掘潜力，发挥积极性和创造性。在竞赛中，交流经验，取长补短，互相支援，这就更可以发挥集体智慧和集体力量。但是，光是这样还不够，在必要的时候，还必须伸出友谊之手，给竞赛对手以无条件的援助。像朱村生产队帮助研里生产队发展养猪事业那样：发现竞赛对手无法解决种猪问题时，就挑选最好的种猪送去；知道对方母猪发情因无公猪交配将要造成空怀时，宁愿本队少配两头母猪，立即先去帮助对方。
    我们的社会主义劳动竞赛不同于资本主义的竞争。在资本主义社会里，一切都从资本家的私利出发，互相排挤，互相打击，尔虞我诈，损人利己，结果是大鱼吃小鱼，少数人得利，大多数人受损失。我们的竞赛是为更好地发展社会主义事业，使大家生活共同提高。大家的利益是一致的，奋斗目标是共同的。因此，在竞赛中既要互相追赶，也要互相支持；既要有条件的协作，也要无条件的帮助。
    无条件的帮助是不是违背等价交换的原则呢？两者是不是不能并存呢？当然不是这样。等价互利是目前我们应当遵守的社会主义原则，互相帮助也是我们应该提倡的社会主义精神。只有把两者很好地结合起来，才能使我们的整个社会主义事业全面迅速地发展起来。事实也正是这样的，全国著名植棉能手张秋香，花费了很多时间把自己的经验传授给别人，热心地帮助别人，在她的帮助和影响下，有许多植棉小组赶上或者超过了她的棉花产量，渭南全县十二万多亩“秋香田”，平均达到亩产籽棉二百七十多斤。从她本人和她所在的单位来看，工作上可能有一些“损失”，但是全县的棉花却获得了更大的丰收，得失相比，哪样对发展生产更有利呢？而且，有些帮助，孤立地看起来好像是无偿的，但从全面看来，却又是互助互利的。朱村生产队在养猪上帮助了研里队，而在去年采春茶时，朱村队不是也受到其他单位的帮助吗！这种帮助虽不是两者之间的直接帮助，但实质上还是大范围的互助协作的关系。任何单位都不能万事不求人。因此，在协作中我们既要遵守互利等价的原则，也要提倡热心帮助别人、共同前进的共产主义风格，以促进我们社会主义建设事业更好更快的发展。
