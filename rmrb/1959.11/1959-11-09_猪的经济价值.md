The Economic Value of Pigs

Pork is nutritious and delicious. But its economic value is far more than this.

　　Pig manure is the best fertilizer. A pig raised from small to 150 jin can excrete about 40 dan of manure, the nitrogen content of which is equivalent to the nitrogen content of 100 jin of ammonium sulfate. Applying it to the land can increase grain production by 200 to 300 jin.

　　Pig skin, pig bristles, pig hair, pig bones, etc. are all good raw materials for light industry. The products made from these raw materials are exquisite, beautiful and durable.

　　In addition to being edible, pig organs can be made into valuable medicines, such as artificial bezoar, insulin, pepsin, liver extract injection, blood powder, etc.

　　Pork, pig bristles, casings, pig skin, etc. are important export commodities. Roughly six qualified export pigs can be exchanged for one ton of steel; 635 pig skins can be exchanged for a tractor.

　　Pigs are the livestock with the greatest reproductive capacity, the shortest maturity period, and the highest meat yield. Under normal feeding management, a sow can produce 20 to 25 piglets a year. After eight to ten months of feeding, they can grow into fat pigs weighing 150 to 180 jin.

    猪的经济价值
    猪肉营养丰富、滋味鲜美。但是它的经济价值绝不仅此。
    猪粪尿是最好的肥料。一头猪从小养到一百五十斤，大体可排泄粪尿四十担，其中所含的氮相当一百斤硫酸铵所含的氮，施在地里可增产粮食二百斤到三百斤。
    猪皮、猪鬃、猪毛、猪骨头等都是很好的轻工业原料。这些原料制出来的用品精致美观耐用。
    猪的内脏，除供食用外，可以制成贵重的药品，如人造牛黄、胰岛素、胃酶、肝精注射液、血粉等。
    猪肉、猪鬃、肠衣、猪皮等是重要出口物资。大体六头合格出口的猪可换一吨钢材；六百三十五张猪皮可以换一台拖拉机。
    猪是繁殖力最大、成熟期最短、出肉率最高的家畜。在正常的饲养管理下，一头母猪一年可产二十至二十五头仔猪，经过八到十个月的喂养，就可以长成一百五十至一百八十斤重的肥猪。
