The struggle of the African people for independence and freedom is surging forward. The African Trade Union Conference, which closed on the 10th, decided to establish the All-African Trade Union Federation, calling on African workers to wage a fearless struggle for the liberation of Africa. The people of the Congo are valiantly fighting back against the bloody suppression by the colonial authorities and persisting in their just struggle. The people of Uganda are demonstrating against the British colonialists' attempt to pass the "Anti-Boycott Law" to suppress the patriotic movement.

The just struggle of the African people has won the firm support of the people of all countries in the world. The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council issued a statement on the 9th, calling on the people of Asian and African countries to hold an "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day" on December 1st.

    非洲反帝斗争向前迈进
    非洲人民争取独立自由的斗争日益高涨。十日闭幕的非洲工会会议决定成立全非工会联合会，号召非洲工人为非洲的解放事业进行无畏斗争。刚果人民英勇反击殖民当局的血腥镇压，坚持正义斗争，乌干达人民为反对英国殖民者企图通过镇压爱国运动的“反抵制法”，举行了示威。
    非洲人民的正义斗争，得到世界各国人民的坚决支持。亚非人民团结理事会九日发表声明，号召亚非各国人民在十二月一日举行“帝国主义滚出非洲日”。
