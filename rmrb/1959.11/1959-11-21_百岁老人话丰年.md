    Centenarian Speaks of a Bountiful Year
    A few days ago, in the Dazhai Production Team of the Linquan People's Commune in the alpine mountainous area of Qianxi County, I met Yang Chunfa, a 118-year-old Miao elder and a model worker of Guizhou Province. This old man is very strong, and this year's harvest has made him even happier. He led me to climb the hillside next to the village, pointed to the newly harvested land, and enthusiastically praised the People's Commune for bringing longevity and prosperity.
    The old man said: "I have lived for more than one hundred and ten years, and I have never seen such a good harvest like this year. Although our team's more than one thousand mu of corn suffered from drought this year, the total output still increased by 50% compared to last year, and the yield per mu also increased by more than 20%. In the past, some people thought that our place was alpine, cold, and barren, and could not grow good crops. Look! This year's corn stalks are much thicker than the past corn cobs." As he spoke, he laughed.
    "Last year, Chairman Mao led us to establish the People's Commune, which is really great. Many people around came to help us plow the land and carry manure. The fields were turned over a foot deep and more than an inch of fertilizer was applied. We never dared to imagine such a good thing in the past." Speaking of this, the old man pointed to a piece of barren land of more than one mu in front of his door and said, "I have been planting this land for decades, and in good years with favorable weather, I could only harvest about one hundred catties of corn at most. This year, even though there was no rain for more than fifty days, we still harvested more than two hundred and fifty catties per mu. If it weren't for the People's Commune, how could there be such a good harvest?" (Pan Yuguo)

    百岁老人话丰年
    前几天，我在高寒山区的黔西县林泉公社大寨生产队，遇见了一百一十八岁的苗族老人、贵州省劳动模范杨春发。这位老人身体很健壮，今年的丰收，越发使老人快活。他引我爬到寨边的山坡上，指着刚收获的土地，热情地赞扬人民公社带来了人寿年丰。
    老人说：“我活了一百一十多岁，从来没有见过像今年这样好的收成，我们队里的一千多亩玉米，今年虽然受到旱灾，总产量还比去年增加五成，单产也提高了二成多。过去有人认为我们这个地方高寒贫瘠，长不出好庄稼，你看嘛！今年的玉米秆秆就比过去的玉米苞苞还粗得多。”说着说着就笑起来了。
    “去年毛主席领导我们成立人民公社，真是好得很，周围许多人来帮我们犁土、挑粪，田土都翻了尺把深，放了一寸多厚的肥料，过去那敢想这样的好事。”谈到这里，老人指着他门前的一块一亩多的瘦土说：“这块土我种了几十年，风调雨顺的好年成最多也才收一百来斤玉米。今年虽然五十多天无雨，每亩还收得二百五十多斤。如果不是人民公社，那会有这样的好收成呢？”（潘玉国）
