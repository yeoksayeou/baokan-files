Xinhua News Agency, 7th - Water and electricity systems representatives attending the national "Heroes' Gathering" advanced experience exchange meeting, totaling two hundred and twenty-three people, proposed to workers on the national water and electricity construction front the following initiative: To overfulfill this year's power generation and installed capacity tasks ahead of schedule and to prepare for continued leaps forward next year.

The water and electricity system representatives spent five days, divided into three professional groups—water conservancy and hydropower, electricity production, and electrical construction—to exchange experiences in a thorough and detailed manner.

The advanced collectives and advanced producers in water conservancy and hydropower attending this "Heroes' Gathering" have made more than one hundred and forty inventions and technological innovations since the Great Leap Forward last year, playing a significant role in promoting water conservancy and hydropower construction. The representatives shared experiences in improving excavation and drilling methods, increasing work efficiency, rapid concrete pouring construction, self-manufacturing indigenous machinery to solve equipment shortages, and construction management. Gao Shihua, a representative from the Xin'an River Engineering Bureau, used a hand drill to create a grouting machine, solving the difficulty of not having a drilling machine and greatly accelerating the foundation treatment speed. Xiang Xianyi, a representative from the Sichuan Zipingpu Engineering Bureau, could supervise six to twelve wind drills alone, drilling four hundred meters a day, increasing efficiency twelvefold. The Gansu Yintao Engineering Bureau added white firestone (calcite) to explosives, saving a large amount of explosives. Zhao Fujiang's team from the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau improved labor organization and strengthened construction management, creating a record of pouring 1,219.6 cubic meters of concrete per shift. These experiences were all valued by the attending representatives.

In electricity production, the representatives were divided into five groups: enterprise management, boilers, steam turbines, electrical equipment, and power transmission and transformation to exchange experiences. At the enterprise management group meeting, representatives from various regions were very interested in the experience introduced by Su Jie, director of the Fushun Power Plant, in adhering to putting politics in command, vigorously launching mass movements, and achieving overall leaps forward in safety, high production, and low consumption. In addition, experiences introduced by representatives from Zhengzhou, Taiyuan, Baqiao, and other power plants on liquid slag discharge from boilers, Cai Heng'an, a red banner pace-setter from the Liaoyuan Power Plant, on ten years of safe operation, and Wu Yunxiu, an old line patrolman from the Jilin Provincial Electric Power Bureau, on line patrol experiences, were all welcomed by the representatives.

At the electrical construction experience exchange meeting, the representatives contributed a total of forty-six major experiences. Zhu Quanyuan, a technician from the No. 1 Engineering Department of the Anhui Thermal Power Bureau, introduced the experience of installing 25,000-kilowatt generators in the open air using indigenous methods, greatly reducing installation costs. Liu Guangyuan, a crane operator from the No. 1 Electric Power Construction Company of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, introduced the experience of using both indigenous and modern cranes in hoisting large units, increasing the weight from thirty-three tons to sixty-three tons. These gave the representatives great inspiration. Many people also drew sketches and made detailed records, preparing to use them in conjunction with local conditions.

On November 6, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power convened a national electric power construction telephone broadcast meeting. At the meeting, Bai Bao'an, chief engineer of the Jilin Installation Company, representing all advanced producers in the power construction system participating in the "Heroes' Gathering," proposed to the national thermal power construction workers an initiative to carry out in-depth competition centered on high output, high quality, and low cost, and to complete this year's thermal power construction plan ahead of schedule. This initiative was immediately responded to by the workers from various regions attending the meeting.

During the meeting, Liu Lanbo, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, gave a report to the representatives, calling on hydropower workers to work hard in the fourth quarter and to complete this year's production and capital construction tasks outstandingly. The representatives warmly supported this report in the discussion and expressed their determination to continuously leap forward, making production redder every day and redder every month. The conference also received good news reports from several power plants and construction units in the Beijing area.

    水利电力先锋人人“献宝”
    交流大跃进以来先进经验保证出色地完成全年计划
    据新华社7日讯　提前超额完成今年发电、装机任务，为明年继续跃进作好准备，这是出席全国“群英会”水利电力系统先进经验交流会的二百二十三名代表，向全国水利电力建设战线职工提出的倡议。
    水利电力系统的代表们以五天时间，分成水利水电、电力生产、电业建设三个专业，深入、细致地交流了经验。
    出席这次群英会的水利水电方面的先进集体和先进生产者，自去年大跃进以来进行了一百四十多项发明创造和技术革新，对促进水利水电建设起了巨大的作用。代表们相互介绍了改进开挖施工和打钻操作方法、提高工作效率的经验，混凝土浇灌快速施工的经验，自制土机械解决设备不足的经验，以及施工管理方面的经验。新安江工程局代表高世怀用手风钻打灌浆机，解决了没有钻机的困难，大大加速了基础处理速度；四川紫坪铺工程局代表向贤益一人能看六到十二台风钻，一天打眼四百米，提高工效十二倍；甘肃引洮工程局在炸药中渗白火石（方解石）节约了大量炸药；三门峡工程局赵福江班改进劳动组织，加强施工管理，创造班浇混凝土一千二百一十九点六立方米的纪录，这些经验都得到了到会代表们的重视。
    在电力生产方面，代表们分成企业管理、锅炉、汽机、电气和送变电五个小组交流经验。在企业管理小组会上，各地代表对抚顺发电厂厂长苏杰介绍的坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，取得安全、高产、低耗等全面跃进的经验很感兴趣。此外，郑州、太原、坝桥等电厂代表介绍的锅炉液态排渣，辽源电厂红旗标兵班代表蔡恒安介绍的十年来安全操作；吉林省电业局老巡线工吴允修介绍的巡线经验，都受到代表们的欢迎。
    在电力建设经验交流会上，代表们共献出了四十六项主要经验。安徽火电局第一工程处技师朱泉源介绍的土法露天安装二万五千瓩发电机，大大降低安装费用的经验；内蒙古自治区第一电力建设公司起重班长刘广元介绍的土洋吊车并用，在吊装大型机组中，使重量由三十三吨提高到六十三吨的经验；都给代表们很大的启发。许多人还特地画了草图，作了详细记录，准备结合本地情况加以利用。
    水利电力部在11月6日召开了全国电力建设电话广播会议。会上，吉林安装公司总工程师白宝安代表参加“群英会”的电力建设系统全体先进生产者，向全国火电建设职工提出了倡议，要求全国同行深入开展以高产、优质、低成本为中心的竞赛，提前完成今年的火电建设计划。这一倡议立刻得到了各地参加会议职工的响应。
    水利电力部副部长刘澜波在会议期间向代表作了报告，号召水电职工大干第四季度，出色地完成今年的生产和基建任务。代表们在讨论中热烈拥护这一报告，并且表示决心不断跃进，使生产日日红，月月红。大会还收到了北京地区几个发电厂和施工单位的报捷书。
