Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The national industrial bearing production task stipulated for this year has been completed ahead of schedule with overfulfillment by the 10th of this month.

Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, bearing industrial enterprises across the country have implemented the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, opposed right-leaning tendencies, boosted morale, and vigorously carried out mass movements, causing various production indicators to leap forward again and again. Since opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale in August, Harbin Bearing Factory has completed its tasks ahead of schedule every month, overproducing every month, and completing its annual production plan two months ahead of schedule.

Vigorously engaging in technological innovation and revolution is one of the important guarantees for the bearing industry to complete the national plan ahead of schedule with overfulfillment. Harbin Bearing Factory employees have vigorously engaged in mechanization and automation, improved equipment, and innovated tools, realizing more than 2,200 technological innovation proposals, which has multiplied the output of many processes. Luoyang Bearing Factory's steel ball inspection station, through advanced technology performance competitions, summarized and promoted 32 advanced inspection methods, greatly improving the efficiency of steel ball inspection. Wafangdian Bearing Factory, through three-in-one (workers, cadres, technicians) technical performance competitions, broke through the key to large steel ball grinding processing, increasing production efficiency by more than one time.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 16th: Fujian Province's machinery industry system has completed this year's output value plan 50 days ahead of schedule with an overfulfillment of 2.7%, more than doubling the same period of the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. The output of more than 20 major products such as water turbines, sugar machines, pumps for industrial and agricultural use, and motors has completed the annual plan ahead of schedule, and the quality has also reached the national standards and design requirements. The cost of various products has been declining quarter by quarter since the second quarter of this year, and labor productivity has also increased significantly compared with last year.

Fujian Province's machinery industry's early completion of the annual production plan is the result of implementing the general line, adhering to putting politics in command, and vigorously carrying out mass movements. Especially since August this year, under the Party's battle call to "oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and rigorously increase production and practice economy," employees of various factories have generally carried out red flag competitions centered on "high yield, high quality, low consumption, safety, and collaboration," and closely integrated the competition with technological innovation. According to incomplete statistics from January to October, employees in the province's machinery industry have put forward more than 25,000 rationalization proposals, of which more than 15,000 have been realized.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 16th: Fujian Province has completed its annual construction and installation tasks ahead of schedule, with a total of 1,104 projects put into production and use.

Since the beginning of this year, under the leadership of the Party, construction workers in Fujian Province have held high the red flag of the general line, braving wind and rain, and working tirelessly, building factories, schools, hospitals, and new residential villages with heroic labor, completing a total construction area of 650,000 square meters. Among the projects that have been fully or partially put into production and use are Sanming Iron and Steel Plant, Fuzhou August 1st Iron and Steel Plant, Fuzhou Second Chemical Plant, Fuzhou Antibiotic Plant, Sanming Chemical Plant, Fuzhou Power Plant, Sanming Thermal Power Plant, Sanming Water Plant, and Fuzhou Wood Comprehensive Processing Plant.

In completing this year's construction tasks, construction workers in Fujian Province not only did more and faster, but also did well and saved money. Most of the factories that have been inspected, test-run, and put into production meet the design standards; civil buildings have also been significantly improved in terms of modeling art, structure, and color, and have been well received by the masses; from January to October, the province's construction and installation costs were reduced by a total of more than 3.71 million yuan compared with the plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 16th: Employees of construction and installation enterprises in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have comprehensively completed this year's national plan ahead of schedule. As of October 31, the construction and installation workload completed by various capital construction units in the Autonomous Region had exceeded the annual plan by 3.5%, the area of completion exceeded the annual plan by 0.3%, the labor productivity of construction and installation workers exceeded the plan by 2%, and costs were reduced by 13.8%.

This year, the construction and installation workload in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has increased by nearly one time compared with last year. The broad masses of employees resolutely implemented the principle of "taking steel as the key link, ensuring key points, and comprehensively leaping forward," and vigorously carried out mass movements. Employees of various units put forward 2,885 rationalization proposals in the first ten months of this year alone, greatly improving construction efficiency. In order to ensure the completion of this year's tasks, various construction and installation contracting enterprises also widely carried out diversified operations. At present, there are 17 construction and installation contracting enterprises in the region that have self-established more than 60 small factories providing services for construction and installation. In the past, many materials had to rely on national allocation. After carrying out diversified operations, in addition to steel, wood, cement, and other materials that are uniformly allocated by the state, many materials can be produced by themselves.

Among the various projects that have been completed, industrial projects account for 256, including the steelmaking, rolling, and casting workshops of the August 1st Iron and Steel Plant, the steelmaking workshop of Tianlong Iron and Steel Plant, the Kashi Hydropower Station, and the Karamay Oil Refinery. The completion of these projects has greatly increased the autonomous region's production capacity of steel, electricity, coal, petroleum, and machinery manufacturing and repair, creating favorable conditions for the autonomous region's continued leap forward next year.

    今年工业轴承生产计划提前完成
    福建提前完成全年机械工业产值和建筑安装任务
    新疆建筑安装企业提前两个月全面完成了年计划
    据新华社16日讯　今年国家规定的工业轴承生产任务，到本月10日为止已经提前超额完成。
    全国轴承工业企业在各级党委领导下，贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，反右倾鼓干劲，大搞群众运动，使各项生产指标一跃再跃。哈尔滨轴承厂自8月反右倾鼓干劲以后，月月提前完成任务，月月超产，提前两个月完成了全年产量计划。
    大搞技术革新和技术革命，是轴承工业提前超额完成国家计划的重要保证之一。哈尔滨轴承厂职工大搞机械化、自动化，改进设备，革新工具，实现了两千二百多项技术革新建议，使很多工序产量成倍提高。洛阳轴承厂钢球检查站通过先进技术表演赛，总结推广了三十二条先进检查方法，大大提高了钢球检查效率。瓦房店轴承厂通过三结合技术表演赛，突破了大钢球磨加工关键，提高生产效率一倍以上。
    据新华社福州16日电　福建省机械工业系统已经提前五十天超额2.7％完成今年的产值计划，比大跃进的1958年同期增长一倍多。水轮机、制糖机、工农业用泵、电机等二十多种主要产品的产量，都提前完成了全年的计划，质量也都达到国家规定的标准和设计要求。各项产品的成本，自今年第二季度以来季季下降，劳动生产率也比去年有了很大增长。
    福建省机械工业提前完成全年生产计划，是贯彻总路线、坚持政治挂帅、大搞群众运动的结果。特别是今年8月以来，各厂职工在党的“反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约”的战斗号召下，普遍开展了以“高产优质低耗安全和协作”为中心的红旗竞赛，并且使竞赛同技术革新紧密结合起来。据1至10月份的不完全统计，全省机械行业职工共提出了合理化建议二万五千多项，已经实现的有一万五千多项。
    据新华社福州16日电　福建省到目前为止已经提前完成了全年的建筑安装任务，先后交付生产、使用的工程共有一千一百零四项。
    今年以来，福建省建筑业职工在党的领导下，高举总路线红旗，栉风沐雨、披星戴月，以英勇的劳动建起了一座座工厂、学校、医院和居民新村，完成的总建筑面积达六十五万平方米。已经全部或部分交付生产、使用的工程项目中，有三明钢铁厂、福州八一钢铁厂、福州第二化工厂、福州抗菌素厂、三明化工厂、福州电厂、三明热电厂、三明水厂和福州木材综合加工厂等。
    福建省的建筑业职工在完成今年的建设任务中，不仅做到多快，而且做到了好省。经验收试车生产的工厂，绝大部分都符合设计标准；民用建筑在造型艺术、结构、色调等方面，也都有显著提高，受到群众好评；1至10月份全省建筑安装成本，比计划共降低了三百七十一万多元。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐16日电　新疆维吾尔自治区建筑安装企业职工，已经提前全面完成了今年全年的国家计划。到10月31日止，自治区各基本建设单位完成的建筑安装工作量已经超过全年计划3.5％，竣工面积超过全年计划0.3％，建筑安装工人劳动生产率超过计划2％，降低成本13.8％。
    今年，新疆维吾尔自治区的建筑安装工作量比去年增长近一倍。广大职工坚决贯彻了“以钢为纲，保证重点，全面跃进”的方针，大搞群众运动。各单位职工仅在今年头十个月里，就提出了二千八百八十五项合理化建议，大大提高了施工效率。为保证完成今年的任务，各建筑安装承包企业还广泛开展了多种经营。目前全区已有十七个建筑安装承包企业，自办了六十多个为建筑安装服务的小型工厂。过去许多材料都要依靠国家调拨，开展多种经营后，除了由国家统一调配的钢材、木材、水泥等以外，许多材料都可以自己生产了。
    在已经完成的各项工程中，工业项目占二百五十六个，其中有八一钢铁厂的炼钢、轧钢、铸造车间，天龙钢铁厂炼钢车间，喀什水电站，克拉玛依炼油厂等。这些工程的完成，使自治区的钢铁、电力、煤炭、石油和机械制造、修配的生产能力大大增加，为自治区明年的继续跃进创造了有利条件。
