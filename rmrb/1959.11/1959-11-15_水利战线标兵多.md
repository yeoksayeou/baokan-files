Many Model Workers on the Water Conservancy Front

	Explosion Expert Guan Zhengcai
	Comrade Guan Zhengcai was originally a layman when it came to blasting; he hadn't studied it. In the summer of last year, when they were working on the Yin Tao construction site at Yanzi Mountain, the rock in that area was very hard and needed to be blasted, but there was no blaster in the team. They had to continue using pry bars, which was very inefficient, and this would delay the project. What to do? "Learn, I must learn to blast," he decided, and he asked the Party committee to let him study blasting techniques. Because of his diligent study, he was able to independently master blasting operations in just four days. Under his leadership and influence, the entire squadron quickly organized a youth commando blasting team, changing the situation of using pry bars, and increasing average efficiency from just over four cubic meters to more than twenty cubic meters.
	He is not only a good learner but also a very brave man. At the end of September, the Dongfeng team drilled large blast holes numbered one and two on the Yinggezui, loaded three and a half tons of explosives, and planned to blast 150,000 cubic meters of rock. Guan Zhengcai, He Chunbao, and other comrades were assigned the task of firing the blast. Everything was ready, and the generator was started, but none of the charges went off. What was the reason? Was there a problem with the wiring? They climbed the rocks and trees, carefully inspecting the wires, but couldn't find the problem. The generator was started again for a second attempt, but still no explosion. This worried Guan Zhengcai. After returning from the meeting at night, it was already past one o'clock, but he couldn't sleep, tossing and turning: Was the wiring in the holes connected wrong? Were the detonators damp? Were the explosives defective? He ruled out all of these possibilities. The next day and the third day, they moved the generator to two thousand meters and eight hundred meters away from the blast holes, but still no explosion. Guan Zhengcai became even more anxious. The failure to detonate this blast had already affected the normal construction of over two thousand people in the entire section for three days. If it didn't go off again, there was a possibility of spontaneous explosion in five days. An explosion would endanger the lives of the people working nearby, and this would cause great losses to the work! No, even if it meant sacrificing himself, he would make the blast go off. So, he went to the basic Party committee secretary, Comrade Xu Xing, and asked the Party to approve his going to the number three hole, fifty meters from the blast hole, to generate electricity. After saying that, he was about to move the generator, but Comrade Xu Xing quickly stopped him and said, "Don't worry, the Party committee is studying a solution to detonate the blast without injuring anyone." That afternoon, with the help of engineers and technicians, they discovered that the problem was insufficient power. Guan Zhengcai immediately increased the power and completed the blasting task.
	As the project expanded, the amount of explosives used increased daily, and the supply of explosives gradually became insufficient. The Party organization at the construction site called on the blasters to find ways to save explosives. How could they save explosives? Guan Zhengcai was constantly thinking about this issue. He recalled hearing comrades from the Linxia "Tiger Team" say that mixing in white flint (fangyinshi) could save explosives. But he had never tried it and was hesitant. One day, while he was resting on the mountain and warming himself by the fire, someone threw a piece of white flint into the fire, and there were crackling explosions. This touched his mind again. He felt that using white flint to replace explosives made sense and immediately drilled two blast holes of the same size in the same terrain, one filled with pure explosives and the other mixed with some white flint. After the explosion, the amount of rock blasted was the same. This successful experiment opened up a new way to save explosives.

	Zhao Fujing Races Against the Flood
	Communist Party member Zhao Fujing is the leader of the concrete pouring team of the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau. Because he is good at working skillfully, he has won the glorious title of advanced team in quality, high production, safety, economy, and overall success four times in the process of leading the entire team to pour 45,700 cubic meters of concrete. He himself has been rated as a labor model and advanced producer ten times over the years, becoming a red banner on the Sanmenxia construction site.
	In leading the work of the concrete pouring team, Zhao Fujing focused on ideological education, deeply understood the characteristics of each comrade in the team, assigned work according to individual strengths, and gave full play to each person's expertise, greatly improving labor efficiency. From the original 288 cubic meters poured per day, it increased to 587.3 cubic meters, driving other teams to improve efficiency and creating good conditions for the cutoff project.
	When the Engineering Bureau proposed to increase the monthly pouring volume to 100,000 cubic meters in March of this year, there was a general feeling of insufficient labor. Zhao Fujing's team automatically proposed to withdraw 20 people from the team of 90 to support brother units. The team itself, through further improving labor organization and launching a high-efficiency competition, proposed that one person should do the work of two, with good quality. As a result, the average efficiency in March was more than six times higher than in February.
	During the pouring of the non-overflow section on the right bank of the dam, due to limitations in the site and mechanical hoisting conditions, concrete could only be transported into the storage bay by dump trucks. Initially, only a little over 190 cubic meters were poured per shift, and efficiency could not be improved, which would inevitably affect flood control during the flood season. Zhao Fujing first actively improved operating methods and improved the division of labor, and finally created a record of pouring 686.4 cubic meters per dump truck shift, causing efficiency to rise sharply and catching up with the flood season.
	The comb teeth piers of Sanmenxia rose day by day, and the crane booms could no longer reach the construction height. Dump trucks could not complete the task, and the belt conveyors often broke down, so many comrades were unwilling to use them. Comrade Zhao Fujing adopted them without hesitation and studied with his comrades to find the cause of the failure and successfully solved the problems of working shaft loosening and slurry leakage, enabling the mechanization of concrete transportation. The original manual pushcarts could carry 68 cubic meters per shift, but after using belt conveyors, it increased to 213 cubic meters.
	In order to avoid quality accidents, Zhao Fujing and his team members improved the responsibility system, changing scattered vibration to centralized row vibration. After this method was implemented in the whole team, there have been no quality accidents in the whole team for 500 days.

	"Knack" Zhu
	Communist Party member Zhu Deming is an eighth-grade veteran repair technician with 21 years of work experience. He is now the deputy director of the repair workshop of the Hebei Gangnan Reservoir Repair and Assembly Plant.
	Comrade Zhu Deming has participated in the construction of the Shimantan Reservoir, Boshan Reservoir, and the Huai River project since 1951. For several years, he has been an advanced producer in water conservancy construction and has been selected as a labor model for consecutive years. After arriving at the Gangnan Reservoir construction site in Hebei, his enthusiasm was even more spurred on. In just over three months, in August of this year, he successfully trial-produced a 150-kilogram-plus clamp hammer, which reduced labor intensity and increased production efficiency by three times.
	When Gangnan Reservoir was racing against the flood, the project was very urgent, but it was difficult to climb the slope after the dam was heightened. Using manpower to pull the cart was very inefficient and could not meet the requirements. At this time, Zhu Deming and technician Jia Jian of the factory jointly designed a simplified rope-traction climbing device, which played a great role in project construction. In addition, he and other comrades jointly manufactured a pin-pressing machine, which can turn the track chain of a tractor over for use, which can extend its service life by one time.

    水利战线标兵多
    爆破能手关正才
    关正才同志本来对爆破是个外行，没学过。在去年的夏天，他们在引洮工地燕子山劳动时，因为这一带岩石十分坚硬，需要进行爆破，但是，队里没有爆破手。只得仍旧用洋镐撬，工效很低，老这样下去，就要拖迟工期。怎么办？“去学，我一定要学会爆破”，他打定了主意，便向党委提出了去学习爆破技术的要求。由于他的刻苦钻研，只学了四天，就能独立掌握爆破操作。全中队在他的带动影响下，很快就组织了一支青年突击爆破队，一改过去用洋镐撬打的状况，平均工效从过去的四方多，提高到二十多方。
    他不仅是个好学的人，而且还是一个十分勇敢的人。9月底，东风小队在鹦哥嘴上打了一、二号大炮眼，装上了三吨半的炸药，计划炸石十五万方，由关正才、何春保等同志担任放炮任务。一切工作准备好了，便开动了发电机，但是炮都不响。什么原因，是不是线路有毛病？他们爬岩上树，顺着电线仔细检查了一遍，没找出毛病。第二次又开动发电机，进行爆破，还是不响。这事可急坏了关正才。夜间，他开完会回来已下一点了，可是躺在床上老是睡不着，翻来复去地想：是不是洞里的线路接错了？是不是雷管发了潮？是不是炸药有毛病？这些，他都否定了。第二天、第三天，他们把发动机移到离炮洞二千米、八百米，仍然不响。关正才心里更加着急起来，这一炮没放响，已经影响了全工段二千多人三天的正常施工了，要是再不响，五天以后，就有自动爆破的可能。一爆破，周围施工的人就有生命的危险，这会给工作带来多大的损失呀！不行，哪怕牺牲自己，也要叫大炮放响。于是便跑到基层党委书记徐行同志那里，请求党批准他到离炮眼五十米的三号洞子里去发电。说罢，他就要去搬发电机，徐行同志赶紧拦阻他说：“不要急，党委正在研究办法，既要把炮放响，又要不损伤一个人”。当天下午，在工程师和技术员的帮助下，发现了是电力太小的原因。关正才随即加大电力，完成了这一爆破任务。
    由于工程扩大，炸药用量日益增多，炸药的供应渐渐感到有些不足，工地党组织向爆破手们发出了要多想办法，节约炸药的号召。我们该怎样才能节约炸药？关正才时刻在琢磨这一问题。他回忆起过去曾听临夏“老虎队”的同志说过，掺用白火石（方引石）可以节省炸药。但没有试过，心里还有些犹豫不定。一天，他在山上休息烤火，不知谁将一块白火石扒到火里，顿时响起了劈劈拍拍的爆炸声，这又触动了他的心思。他感到用白火石代替炸药是有道理，立刻在同样的地形上，打了两个同样大小的炮眼，一个净装炸药，一个掺些白火石，爆炸之后方数都一样。这一试验成功后，为节约炸药开辟了一条新的道路。
    赵福江和洪水赛跑
    共产党员赵福江同志，是三门峡工程局混凝土浇筑班的班长。由于他善于巧干，在领导全班浇筑四万五千七百立米混凝土的过程当中，曾连获四次优质、高产、安全、节约、满堂红先进班的光荣称号；他自己几年来也十次被评为劳动模范和先进生产者。成为三门峡工地上的一面红旗。
    在领导混凝土浇筑班的工作中，赵福江抓紧了思想教育工作，深入了解班里每个同志的特点，因人制宜分配工作，发挥每个人的特长，使劳动效率大大提高，由原来每天浇筑二百八十八立米提高到五百八十七点三立米，带动了其他班组提高工效，为截流工程创造了良好的条件。
    今年3月工程局提出将月浇筑量提高到十万立米时，劳动力普遍感到不足。赵福江班自动提出从全班九十人中抽出二十人支援兄弟单位，自己班里通过进一步改进劳动组织，展开高工效竞赛，提出要一人干两人的活，质量良好；结果，3月份平均工效比2月份提高六倍多。
    在浇筑大坝右岸非溢流部时，因为现场及机械吊运条件限制，只能用斗车运输混凝土进仓，开始时，每台班只浇筑一百九十多立米，工效提不高，势必影响汛期拦洪。赵福江先从积极改进操作方法，改善劳动分工，终于创造了斗车台班浇筑六百八十六点四立米的纪录，使工效直线上升，赶到了汛期前面。
    三门峡梳齿墩逐日升高，吊车臂杆已不能到达施工高程了，用斗车也不能完成任务，而皮带运输机又经常出故障，许多同志不愿使用；赵福江同志毫不犹豫地采用了它，并和同志们研究，找出故障原因，并且顺利地解决了工作轴松动和漏浆的问题，使混凝土运输机械化，原用手推车每台班六十八立米，使用皮带运输机后提高为二百十三立米。
    为了避免产生质量事故，赵福江和班里同志一起，改进了责任制度，将分散震捣改为集中排行震捣，这个方法在全班推行以后，到现在全班已五百天没有发生过质量事故了。
    窍门朱
    共产党员朱德明同志，是一个有着二十一年工龄的八级修理老技工，现在是河北岗南水库修配总厂修理车间副主任。
    朱德明同志从1951年起，先后参加石漫滩水库、薄山水库和治淮工程等。几年来他一直是水利建设事业上的先进生产者，连年被选为劳动模范。来到河北岗南水库工地后，他的干劲更加鼓足了，仅用了三个多月的时间，在今年8月份，试制成功了一百五十多公斤重的夹板锤，减轻了劳动强度，提高生产效率三倍。
    岗南水库和洪水竞跑时工程很紧急，但大坝加高后爬坡困难了，用人力拉车工效很低，不能满足要求，这时，朱德明又和厂里技工贾鉴同志共同设计出一个简化的绳索牵引爬坡器，对工程施工起到很大的作用。此外，他还和其他同志共同制造了压肖机，把拖拉机的轨链翻过来使用，可延长使用年限一倍。
