	"Great Collaboration - The Great Spirit of the Times," was the title of an editorial in the Shanghai Liberation Daily on November 18. Recently, the Liberation Daily has given more prominent publicity to the spirit of collaboration, gradually expanding the scope of reporting and providing more insightful analysis.

	On November 6, the Liberation Daily prominently reported on the front page that members of the Communist Youth League and young workers in the tool workshop of the Shanghai Tool Factory shouted an inspiring slogan: "In the rapid march of socialist construction, we will never let a comrade fall behind and advance at high speed into 1960 together!" Encouraged by this slogan, advanced workers used various methods to help their companions catch up. Among the eighty young workers with quotas, fifty-three had advanced at high speed into 1960. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League wrote a letter praising their noble style and calling on all members of the Communist Youth League and young workers in the city to learn from their spirit. Subsequently, the newspaper reported on the enthusiastic response of young workers throughout the city to the call of "Not letting a comrade fall behind": advanced workers helping backward workers, fast hands helping slow hands, skilled hands helping green hands, masters helping apprentices; everyone signing "mutual aid contracts," "sister contracts," and "leap forward contracts"; organizing "youth shock brigades" and "common leap forward mutual aid teams"; launching "double hit competitions" and "three help activities." In unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation, the workers developed a noble communist style. Some exchanged their good machines for others' bad machines, enthusiastically helping others to catch up with them; some took the initiative to transfer to backward groups to help everyone improve their operating level; some selflessly passed on technical experience, advancing into 1960 alongside all comrades in the group...

	Just as the "Not Letting a Comrade Fall Behind" movement was widely carried out throughout the city, the Liberation Daily reported on another slogan put forward by seventeen factories in the Putuo District machine foundry industry: "In the march to complete this year's national plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target, we will not let a brother factory fall behind." This is also a heroic slogan full of the spirit of communist collaboration. The newspaper introduced to its readers the vivid examples of these seventeen factories helping each other and advancing hand in hand. The Kezhu Iron Factory produces wood roller machines, and in the past, it often failed to complete its plan because the castings of the cooperative factories could not be supplied in time. The workers of the Gujinji Foundry Factory regarded the difficulties of this brother factory as their own, and despite their heavy tasks, they still drew manpower to specialize in castings for the Kezhu Factory, helping them to complete the national plan. The Shanghai Piston Ring Factory had weak technical strength, and the quality of its products could not be improved, so it always failed to complete its tasks. After putting forward the slogan "Not letting a brother factory fall behind," several brother factories sent technicians and skilled workers to "consult" together, helping them to overcome the quality barrier, and then the output rose steadily, and both September and October completed the plan, and the output of these two months was equal to the total of the past seven months. These facts powerfully proved the truth that "cooperation is strength." The newspaper, while publishing this news and afterwards, also published reports that this slogan was enthusiastically responded to in the rubber, food, pharmaceutical, and knitting industries of Putuo District, that the Putuo District Committee of the Communist Party of China was leading and planning to widely develop cooperative relations throughout the district, and that the factories in the Penglai District Light Industry United Industry were supporting each other and achieving "full house red" for five consecutive months.

	The Liberation Daily gave a high evaluation to the communist spirit of collaboration of the working class, which was concentratedly expressed in the two slogans "Not letting a comrade fall behind" and "Not letting a brother factory fall behind." The newspaper successively published commentator articles and editorials. The editorial said: "The concept of the whole, the idea of the overall situation, and communist great collaboration are the spirit and characteristics of our times, and are the ideological form and superstructure that are compatible with our entire socialist economic system." The editorial also said that whether the spirit of communist collaboration is carried forward enough has become one of the important criteria for measuring whether each enterprise holds the political banner high and whether each comrade's class consciousness is high. Some reports of the Liberation Daily not only wrote about the driving role of implementing cooperation on production, but also wrote about the changes in people's mental outlook.

	Recently, the Liberation Daily reported on the slogan put forward by the Shanghai Casting and Forging Industry workers, "Not letting a machine part drag its feet, ensuring that each machine is complete," and the socialist great collaboration they carried out to realize this slogan. This slogan also embodies the overall idea. The newspaper also published a commentary on this event, believing that this slogan will soon be enthusiastically responded to by the city's mechanical workers. At the same time, it pointed out that every enterprise must have a global perspective, treat every part it produces with a high sense of responsibility for building socialism, complete the task in a timely manner, only ahead of schedule, and not drag its feet. The newspaper criticized the phenomenon of only paying attention to the completion of the output value and the plan of the main products, and not tightly grasping the production of parts cooperating with foreign factories.

### 让协作之风吹遍每个角落

    让协作之风吹遍每个角落
    “大协作——伟大的时代精神”，这是11月18日上海解放日报一篇社论的题目。最近解放日报对协作精神宣传得比较突出，报道面逐步扩大，也比较有思想性。
    11月6日，解放日报以一版显著地位，报道了上海工具厂工具车间的团员和青年工人喊出的一句激动人心的口号：“在建设社会主义的急行军中，决不让一个同伴掉队，共同高速跨进1960年！”在这个口号的鼓舞下，先进工人用各种办法帮助同伴赶上自己。在八十个有定额的青工中，就有五十三人高速度跨进了1960年。共青团上海市委写信赞扬他们的高尚风格，同时号召全市团员、青工学习他们的精神。接着，报纸报道了全市青工热烈响应“不让一个同伴掉队”号召的情况：先进帮后进，快手帮慢手，熟手帮生手，师傅帮徒弟；大家签订“互助合同”、“姊妹合同”、“跃进合同”；组织“青年突击队”、“共同跃进互助队”；开展“双打赛”、“三帮助”等活动。在团结互助、相互协作中，工人们发扬了崇高的共产主义风格。有人以自己的好车去换人家的坏车，热心帮助别人赶上自己；有人主动要求调到后进小组，帮助大家提高操作水平；有人无私地传授技术经验，同全组同志并肩跨进1960年……
    正当“不让一个同伴掉队”的运动在全市广泛开展的时候，解放日报又报道了普陀区机器翻砂行业十七个工厂提出的另一个口号：“在为提前和超额完成今年国家计划的进军中，不让一个兄弟厂掉队”。这同样是一个充满共产主义协作精神的豪迈口号。报纸向读者介绍了这十七个工厂相互帮助、携手前进的生动事例。科铸铁工厂生产木辊机，过去因为协作厂的铸件不能及时供应，经常完不成计划。顾金记翻砂厂工人把这家兄弟厂的困难看作自己的困难，尽管本身任务很重，还是抽出人力专门为科铸厂搞铸件，帮助他们完成了国家计划。上海活塞环厂由于技术力量薄弱，产品质量一直不能提高，老是完不成任务。在提出“不让一个兄弟厂掉队”的口号后，几个兄弟厂派了技术人员、技术工人一起去“会诊”，帮助他们攻下了质量关，于是产量节节上升，9、10两月都完成了计划，这两个月的产量等于过去七个月的总和。这些事实有力地证明了“协作就是力量”的真理。报纸在刊出这条消息的同时和以后，还发表了这个口号在普陀区橡胶、食品、医药、针织等行业得到热烈反应，中共普陀区委有领导有计划地在全区范围内广泛发展协作关系，以及蓬莱区轻工联合行业各厂互相支援、连续五个月实现“满堂红”等报道。
    解放日报对于“不让一个同伴掉队”和“不让一个兄弟厂掉队”这两个口号所集中表达的工人阶级共产主义协作精神，给予了很高的评价。报纸先后发表了评论员文章和社论。社论中说：“整体观念、全局思想、共产主义大协作，这是我们时代的精神、时代的特色，是与我们整个社会主义经济制度相适应的观念形态、上层建筑。”社论又说，共产主义协作精神发扬得够不够，已成为衡量每个企业政治帅旗举得高不高、衡量每个同志阶级觉悟高不高的重要尺度之一。解放日报的一些报道，不仅写出了实行协作对生产的推动作用，而且写出了人们精神面貌的变化。
    最近解放日报又报道了上海铸锻工业职工提出的“不让一个机件拖后腿，保证每台机器成套”的口号，以及他们为实现这个口号开展的社会主义大协作。这个口号同样体现了整体思想。报纸对这件事也发表了评论，认为这个口号必将迅速得到全市机械工人的热烈响应。同时指出，每一个企业都必须具有全局观点，以高度的建设社会主义责任感来对待自己所生产的每一个机件，及时完成任务，只能提前，不能拖后。报纸批评了那种只注意完成产值和主要产品的计划，而对与外厂协作的配件生产抓得不紧的现象。
