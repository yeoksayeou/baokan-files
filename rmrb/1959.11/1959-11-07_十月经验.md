    October Experience
    Cheng Guangrui
      The aftersound of Aurora Humans awoke from the storm of October, Aurora sounded the first thunder of the new century, and its aftersound still lingers in the clouds. Please listen to the joyful song of the red satellite!
        The Winter Palace gate seems to still retain the sailors' climbing footprints, the stairs seem to still be stained with the blood of the Red Guards, the four walls seem to still echo the roar of Aurora, and the malachite hall seems to still have the old world trembling.
        Red Square is covered with white pigeons, red flags are rolling in the east wind, and the great soul rests in the solemn mausoleum. The chimes of the Spassky Tower are ringing, counting how many journeys the new world has taken.
        Lenin Hills at night overlook the lights just turned on, this capital is covered with tens of thousands of stars, and the Moscow River is like a swimming dragon covered in silver armor. Look at the five red stars shining above the Kremlin, calling out to the red moon singing by—the brothers of October.
      Gorki Village Villa Gorki Village Villa is full of traces of your life, and the trees in the yard are symphonizing in the wind, as if they are your moving words. Ilyich, who said you finished your last road here? No, you walked all over the world with happiness, never stopping.

    十月经验

      阿芙乐尔的余音人类从十月的暴风雨中惊醒，阿芙乐尔响起新世纪的第一声雷鸣，至今它的余音依然在云间缭绕，请听那红色卫星的欢乐的歌声！
        冬宫宫门上仿佛还留着水兵们攀越的脚印，楼梯上仿佛还染着赤卫队员们的血迹，四壁间仿佛还萦回着阿芙乐尔的轰响，孔雀石大厅里仿佛旧世界还在不停颤栗。
        红场广场落满白鸽，红旗漫卷东风，庄严的陵墓里安息着伟大的魂灵。斯巴斯基塔上的钟声当当，数计着新世界又迈进了多少途程。
        列宁山夜眺华灯初放，这都城落满了万点繁星，莫斯科河像一条满身银甲的游龙。看那五颗红星闪耀在克里姆林之上，招呼着歌唱而过的红月——十月的弟兄。
      哥尔克村别墅哥尔克村别墅里处处留着你生的痕迹，满院树木在风前交响，仿佛是你动人的言语。伊里奇，谁说你在这里走完了最后的道路？不，你带着幸福走遍人间，永不停息。
