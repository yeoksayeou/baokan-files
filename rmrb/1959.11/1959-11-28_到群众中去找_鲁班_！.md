Editorial Afterword

	Go to the Masses to Find "Lu Ban"!

	Six water conservancy technicians and a few ordinary levels – that was all! But the people of Dazu County, with great ambitions in their hearts, wanted to vigorously carry out a water conservancy construction movement.

	Some people sneered, thinking: This is bragging!

	Some comrades also kindly offered advice: Please send a group of engineers and allocate some good instruments from higher authorities!

	However, this was not bragging. The thirty-four large, medium, and small reservoirs in Dazu County have all started construction in full swing. Did the higher authorities send a large number of engineers and allocate a large number of surveying instruments? No, don't believe it; news proves it.

	What's going on? The Dazu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party found "Lu Ban" – peasant designers – among the masses. The Party believed in them, cultivated them, and relied on them. It was these "Lu Bans" who surveyed and designed the vast majority of the reservoir projects in less than a month, and immediately started construction. Now, twenty-one reservoirs have been completed and are playing an irrigation role.

	This is an event worthy of a front-page headline, because the event itself vividly illustrates the truth that our Party can be invincible by relying on the masses.

### 到群众中去找“鲁班”！

    到群众中去找“鲁班”！
    六名水利技术员、几架一般水平仪，仅此而已！可是大足县人民在这种条件下胸怀大志，要大搞水利建设运动。
    有的人冷笑一声，心里说：这是吹牛皮！
    有些同志也善心善意地提出了意见：请上级派一批工程师，调拨些好仪器来吧！
    然而，这不是吹牛。大足县的三十四座大中小型水库已经全面动了工，而且搞得热火朝天。是上级派来了大批工程师、调来了大批测量仪器吗？没有的事，不信有消息为证。
    是怎么回事呢？是中共大足县委在群众中找到了“鲁班”——农民设计员。党相信他们、培养他们、依靠他们，就是这些“鲁班”，在不到一个月的时间里，勘查设计了绝大部分水库工程，并且立即动手施工。现在二十一座水库已经修成了，发挥了灌溉效益。
    这是一件值得登头条消息的事件，因为事情的本身，生动地说明了我们党依靠群众就可以无往不胜的真理。
