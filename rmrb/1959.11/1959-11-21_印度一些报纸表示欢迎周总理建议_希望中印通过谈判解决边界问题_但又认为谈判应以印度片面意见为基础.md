Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 20th: Some Indian newspapers have expressed varying degrees of welcome to Premier Zhou's letter to Prime Minister Nehru on November 7th, hoping that China and India will resolve border disputes through negotiations, while also believing that negotiations must be based on India's unilateral views on the Sino-Indian border.

The "National Herald" on November 11th said that Premier Zhou Enlai's letter "deserves careful study." The newspaper said: "At this stage, one cannot doubt the sincerity of Zhou Enlai's desire to be friendly with India, and one must pay attention to his eagerness to prevent Sino-Indian friendship from being damaged."

The newspaper said: "The Indian government and people also hold the hope expressed by Zhou Enlai: for the great and long-standing friendship of more than one billion people in our two countries, the Chinese and Indian governments will work together to seek a rapid solution." It said: "India will hold the same friendly attitude." It also said, "Making appropriate concessions is not equal to appeasement."

The newspaper said that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal on demilitarization "is worth considering because it reflects Zhou Enlai's view that the most important responsibility at present is to take effective steps quickly and without hesitation to seriously improve the uneasy situation between the two countries." However, this newspaper insisted on using the illegal McMahon Line and the so-called Chinese "intrusion into the Ladakh region" as arguments against Premier Zhou's proposal that the Chinese and Indian armies withdraw 20 kilometers from the current line of actual control, although it also admitted that this practice "has often proved useful in history, and the practice itself cannot be opposed."

The editorial of the "Glory" on the same day said that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal "has brought the border dispute issue into a completely new stage. If the steps he has taken are sincere and serious, then the Indian government has an obligation to respond to him after seriously and fully considering his suggestions."

This newspaper believes that there are two aspects to the current situation: the military aspect and the political aspect. "If one considers it from a military perspective and believes that Zhou Enlai's proposal is unworkable, that would be an unfortunate thing... Zhou Enlai has done his best in his letter to try to ensure that the problem does not worsen and does not become worse. The letter also mentioned the long-standing friendship between China and India."

This newspaper said that China's argument is, "If the Indian government can even suggest that both sides withdraw their troops after claiming sovereignty over Longju, until the issue is resolved, then it should not object to accepting China's similar proposal for the entire border. That is to say, if India had taken this step to peacefully resolve the local dispute over Longju, then why should China not take this step to peacefully resolve the entire border dispute... It will not be as easy as some people think for the Indian government to refuse the troop withdrawal proposal. The Indian government itself established this principle; now China is referring to this principle and demanding that it be implemented on the entire 2,500-mile border."

This newspaper said that Premier Zhou Enlai "based his proposal on the appealing Panchsheel principles, good-neighborly relations, and traditional friendship between India and China, and demanded negotiations. If Nehru rejects these proposals, he will be condemning his own proposals as meaningless."

This newspaper said that this is a difficult situation for the Indian government; it also said, "It would be inappropriate if the Indian government avoided taking a correct position after being frightened away by a certain section of domestic public opinion."

This newspaper also defended the Indian government.

The Bengali newspaper "Epoch-Making Times" on the same day said in an editorial, "After so many days, the closed door has been opened, which is an exciting thing. There is no doubt that the Chinese Premier's proposal is very important and deserves thorough and careful consideration by the Indian government."

This newspaper holds the same position as the "National Herald" on the Sino-Indian border issue, insisting that "the Chinese have never been to the areas they recently invaded and then occupied." However, this newspaper also admits that "the Chinese Premier's proposal is very important, so rejecting this proposal would hardly be considered a diplomatically clever act."

The "Leader" said that Premier Zhou Enlai's letter is "a document of far-reaching significance." The newspaper said: "It is wrong and unjust to say that Zhou Enlai's letter is disappointing. Our reaction to Zhou Enlai's letter is not disappointment. On the contrary, our reaction is that we feel hope. This letter has fostered the hope that this big problem will not expand further in the future." However, this newspaper also demanded that India maintain its current tough stance and force China to revise its attitude.

The "Unity" said in an editorial on the 11th that on the one hand, it is necessary to "calmly consider these suggestions," and on the other hand, it opposes accepting the suggestions. This newspaper's self-contradictory logic is: "It is completely wrong to reject the suggestions made by Zhou Enlai in his recent letter simply because these suggestions come from China or because the Indian Communist Party supports these suggestions. It would also be wrong to accept these suggestions simply because he has adopted a soft attitude."

### 印度一些报纸表示欢迎周总理建议  希望中印通过谈判解决边界问题  但又认为谈判应以印度片面意见为基础

    印度一些报纸表示欢迎周总理建议
    希望中印通过谈判解决边界问题
    但又认为谈判应以印度片面意见为基础
    新华社20日讯　新德里消息：印度有些报纸对周总理11月7日给尼赫鲁总理的信表示不同程度的欢迎，希望中印两国通过谈判解决边界纠纷，同时又认为谈判须在印度关于中印边界的片面意见的基础上进行。
    11月11日的“国民先驱报”说，周恩来总理的信“值得仔细研究。”报纸说：“在现阶段，不能够对周恩来争取同印度友好的愿望的诚意有所怀疑，而且必须重视他急于不让印中友谊受到破坏的愿望。”
    报纸说：“印度政府和人民也抱着周恩来所表示的那种希望：为了我们两国十亿多人民的伟大的悠久的友谊，中印两国政府将共同努力求得迅速的解决。”它说：“印度将抱着同样友好的态度。”它又说，“作出适当的让步并不等于姑息。”
    报纸说，周恩来总理关于非军事化的建议“是值得考虑的，因为它反映了周恩来的看法，即目前最重要的责任在于迅速地和毫不迟疑地采取有效步骤，以认真改善两国之间的不安局势。”但是这家报纸坚持以非法的麦克马洪线和所谓中国“侵入了拉达克地区”为论据，反对周总理提出的中印双方军队自目前实际控制的边界线各撤退二十公里的建议，虽然它也承认这种作法“在历史上经常证明是有用的，这种作法本身是不能加以反对的。”
    同一天的“光荣报”的社论说，周恩来总理的建议“使边界争端问题进入了完全新的阶段。如果他所采取的步骤是真诚和认真的，那么，印度政府有义务在认真和充分地考虑他的建议以后再答复他。”
    这家报纸认为，目前的局势有两个方面：军事方面和政治方面。“如果从军事角度考虑，认为周恩来的建议是行不通的，那将是一件不幸的事情……周恩来在他的信中已经尽了他最大的力量来争取使问题不会恶化，不会变糟。信上还谈到中印之间的悠久的友谊。”
    这家报纸说，中国的论点是，“如果印度政府甚至在对朗久提出主权要求以后还能建议双方把军队撤走，直到问题得到解决，那就不应该反对接受中国关于整条边界的类似的建议。这也就是说，如果印度曾经采取这种步骤来和平地解决有关朗久的局部争端，那么，为什么中国不应该采取这种步骤来和平地解决整个边界争端……印度政府要拒绝撤军建议是不会像某些人所想的那么容易的。印度政府自己确立了这个原则；现在中国参照着这个原则，要求在二千五百英里长的整条边界上实行这个原则。”
    这家报纸说，周恩来总理“把他的建议建立在吸引人的潘查希拉原则、睦邻关系和印中传统友谊的基础上，并且要求举行谈判。如果尼赫鲁拒绝这些建议，他就会是自己谴责自己的建议是毫无意义的。”
    这家报纸说，对印度政府来说，这是一个困难的局面；它并且说，“如果印度政府在被国内某一部分舆论吓跑以后就避不采取正确的立场，那将是不适当的。”
    这家报纸同时也为印度政府辩护。
    同一天的孟加拉文报纸“划时代报”在社论中说，“经过这么许多日子以后，关闭着的大门打开了，这是一件令人兴奋的事情。毫无疑问，中国总理的建议是非常重要的，值得印度政府给予彻底和仔细的考虑”。
    这家报纸在中印边界问题上同“国民先驱报”持有同样的立场，硬说“中国人从来没有到过他们最近所侵入随即占领的地区。”但是，这家报纸也承认“中国总理的建议非常重要，因此拒绝这个建议就很难令人认为是外交上机智的行为。”
    “领袖报”说周恩来总理的信是“具有深远意义的文件”。报纸说：“要是说周恩来的信是令人失望的，那是错误的和不公正的。我们对周恩来的信的反应并不是感到失望。恰恰相反，我们的反应是感到有了希望。这封信助长了人们的这种希望：这个大问题将来不会进一步扩大。”但是，这家报纸又要求印度保持它目前的强硬态度，迫使中国修改它的态度。
    “团结报”在11日的社论中一方面说要“冷静地考虑这些建议”，一方面又反对接受建议。这家报纸自相矛盾的逻辑是：“如果仅仅因为这些建议来自中国或者因为印度共产党支持这些建议就拒绝周恩来在他新近的来信中所提出的建议，那是完全错误的。如果仅仅因为他采取了柔和的态度就接受这些建议，那也是错误的。”
