Combine the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement with Technical Innovation

In the new upsurge of the anti-rightist, boost-morale, increase production, and practice economy movement, thousands of workers have achieved new accomplishments on the road of technical innovation. Many individuals, groups, workshops, and enterprises have comprehensively completed and overfulfilled state plans ahead of schedule, and good news of high-speed development continues to pour in. The situation is unprecedentedly good. The current task is to make persistent efforts, thoroughly combat rightism, boost morale, dare to think and act, vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution, and combine the vigorous increase production and practice economy movement with technical innovation to ensure the continued high-speed development of various production and construction undertakings.

The mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy is a movement for workers to compete in revolutionary drive and improve labor productivity. In order to accelerate socialist construction and strive to fundamentally change our country's poor and backward state in a relatively short period, we must work hard. Without hard work, there can be no vigorous mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy. However, while competing in hard work, we must also compete in clever work, in bold and tenacious innovative spirit, and in creative talent. The many advanced collectives and advanced producers that have emerged in the increase production and practice economy movement, some complete two days' quotas in one day, some complete three, four, or even half a month's or a month's quota in one day, some one person does the work of two, some one person does the work of three, four, or even more people. Is this simply because their physical strength is particularly strong compared to others? Of course, we cannot say that. Yes, they first put politics in command, boosted their morale, and increased their labor intensity, which is a fact, and it is also an important source of the Great Leap Forward; however, the most important thing is that they are better than others at combining hard work, solid work, and clever work, and have made greater achievements in technical innovation and technical revolution.

The current situation on the industrial and transportation fronts is thriving. Production in August, September, and October not only increased month by month and ten-day period by ten-day period, but also generally achieved high output, high quality, low consumption, and safe production, a comprehensive leap forward with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This situation can be described as "extremely good." Currently, the problem lies in consolidating this "extremely good" situation and developing it continuously. We must maintain the current rising trend of production forever, complete and overfulfill this year's national Great Leap Forward plan ahead of schedule, and also prepare for the first quarter of next year on this basis, striving for a better and more comprehensive leap forward next year. To this end, we must continuously expand and improve production capacity, overcome weak links in production, and carry out industrial technical revolution in a planned and step-by-step manner, gradually transforming manual operations in certain links of the current production process into mechanized or semi-mechanized operations. How can we continuously expand and improve production capacity, overcome weak links in production, and reform manual operations? Accelerating the construction of new enterprises and adding new equipment is naturally a very important method; however, under the current conditions in our country, the more important method that should and can be adopted is to rely on the broad masses of workers on all fronts, in all enterprises, and in all work procedures to improve equipment, improve tools, improve production methods, tap the capacity of existing equipment, strengthen weak links, and combine the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy with technical innovation. At the same time, through mass technical reform activities, gradually mechanize manual operations through self-reliance, reduce workers' heavy physical labor, and improve their labor efficiency.

Human physical strength, no matter how strong, has a certain limit, and only working without rest is not sustainable. Technical innovation and technical revolution are the most important sources of improving labor productivity, and their potential is endless. Because the development of science and technology is endless, the world of technical innovation and technical revolution is infinitely vast. Taking technical innovation and technical revolution as the main method and main content of the increase production and practice economy movement, and guiding the soaring enthusiasm of millions of workers to technical innovation and technical revolution, and constantly replacing old technologies and old experiences with new technologies and new experiences, can achieve leaps in output, quality, cost, and safety, and achieve a combination of work and rest, and a step-by-step rise. The increase production and practice economy movement can be carried out continuously, ensuring a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward in the future.

The key to further developing technical innovation and technical revolution lies in continuing to promote the communist style of breaking superstitions and daring to think and act among millions of people. Without this communist heroic style, the mass technical innovation movement cannot develop vigorously. Of course, the daring to think and act that we advocate must be a daring to think and act that is closely integrated with a scientific analysis attitude, and it is a revolutionary and scientific boldness in technical innovation. All scientific and technological principles originate from practice. Therefore, we should dare to think of things that predecessors did not dare to think of and dare to do things that predecessors could not do based on the development of practice, boldly reform technologies, and enrich and revise those principles and conclusions that lag behind practice and are already outdated. Of course, every innovation should be scientifically tested. Everything must be tested, and this is our scientific analysis attitude in technical innovation and technical revolution. Some major technical inventions and creations, in addition to successful laboratory tests, should also be tested in intermediate factories, and formally applied to large-scale production only after it is proven to have scientific value and economic value. Emphasizing scientific experiments is for the purpose of reforming better and achieving greater results, which is not contradictory to the original spirit of daring to think and act. We emphasize that technical reforms must be tested because any reform has two possibilities: success and setbacks or even failure. Some may succeed after one test, while others may even fail many times before succeeding, but even if they fail many times, it is not terrible, because failure is the mother of success. Of course, in the process of technical innovation and technical revolution, especially when an innovation is not so smooth, those with right-leaning conservative ideas will definitely stand up and point fingers, pour cold water on the masses, and discourage the masses. Therefore, in order to better carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party, strengthen political command, further combat rightism and boost morale, encourage the masses to dare to think and act, study diligently, not be afraid of difficulties, repeatedly test, not be afraid of failure, be unyielding, and move forward bravely.

Is further developing the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution limited to one's own creations and inventions? No. Creation and invention are like opening up a road in a place where no one has ever been before, raising production technology to a new level, which is undoubtedly very important. However, in addition to this, promoting new technologies and new experiences created and invented by others also falls within the scope of technical innovation and technical revolution. Because any new technology and new experience, although successful, if only a few people can use these new technologies and new experiences, and the majority of people are still using old technologies and old experiences, then the goal of universally improving productivity cannot be achieved. Promoting new technologies and new experiences, like creation and invention, requires ideological emancipation and a spirit of daring to reform. Being satisfied with one's own familiar set and not being good at accepting new technologies and new experiences from others, and sticking to old ways, is also not conducive to carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement, which is what we should oppose.

The many rationalization proposals, new technologies, and new experiences created by the broad masses of workers in technical innovation and technical revolution since the Great Leap Forward last year are very valuable. They have greatly enriched and developed our production practice and scientific and technological principles. Many of these new technologies and new experiences have been widely promoted and used not only within one enterprise but also throughout the industry and even the country, powerfully promoting the development of production. However, there are also many valuable new technologies and new experiences that have not been well promoted, or have not even been used in production, or have been put aside after being used for a while. To ask the reason, some are that the new technologies and new experiences themselves still have some shortcomings and are not so perfect; others are that the leadership work in promoting advanced technologies and experiences in the enterprise has not kept up, forming a laissez-faire situation. It is not surprising that new technologies and new experiences are temporarily not perfect. Any innovation in technical innovation and technical revolution is not achieved overnight. In particular, major technical reforms often require repeated experiments and repeated improvements to succeed. This is because people's understanding of objective things and their mastery of objective laws, from not knowing to knowing, from knowing little to knowing more, from being relatively superficial to being relatively profound, must have a process of practice. Workers must have the courage and determination to never give up until they achieve their goals in technical innovation and technical revolution. The leading comrades of enterprises must give enthusiastic support to the technical reform proposals of the workers. Every enterprise must regard summarizing, improving, and promoting the innovations of workers' technical innovation and technical revolution as a very important organizational task to do, and help new things grow. Whether it is summarizing, improving, or promoting, there must be special personnel in charge, and at the same time, we must rely on the masses. In this regard, the technical performance competition created by the Third Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is a good experience. This method, which focuses on key issues in production and adopts the form of on-site performance and observation, teaching while doing, experimenting while doing, identifying while doing, summarizing while doing, and promoting while doing, effectively combines theory with practice, closely combines improving technology with solving key production problems, combines promoting new technologies and new experiences with labor competition, and combines centralized leadership with vigorously launching mass movements. All localities should learn from the many good methods and forms of promoting new technologies and new experiences that have emerged since the Great Leap Forward last year, so that every good achievement of our technical innovation can be quickly mastered and used by more people, and quickly become the property of the whole people.

Without a vigorous mass movement, there would be no Great Leap Forward; without mass technical innovation and technical revolution, the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy cannot continue to develop. In order to develop the cause of socialist construction at high speed, workers should continue to emancipate their minds, continue to promote the communist style of daring to think and act combined with scientific analysis, and always be pioneers in technical innovation and technical revolution!

### 把增产节约运动和技术革新结合起来

    把增产节约运动和技术革新结合起来
    在反右倾、鼓干劲的增产节约运动的新高潮中，成千上万的职工在技术革新的道路上，取得了一个又一个新成就。很多个人、小组、车间、企业全面地提前完成和超额完成国家计划，高速度地发展的捷报不断传来。形势空前良好。当前的任务是：再接再厉，反透右倾，鼓足干劲，敢想敢干，大闹技术革新和技术革命，把蓬蓬勃勃的增产节约运动和技术革新结合起来，保证各项生产建设事业继续高速度地发展。
    增产节约的群众运动，是职工群众比革命干劲、比提高劳动生产率的运动。为了加速社会主义建设，争取在不很长的时间内，从根本上改变我们国家贫穷落后的面貌，我们必须苦干。没有苦干，就不可能有轰轰烈烈的增产节约的群众运动。但在比苦干的同时，还必须比巧干，比大胆顽强的革新精神，比创造才能。在增产节约运动中涌现出来的许许多多先进集体和先进生产者，有的一天完成两天定额，有的一天完成三天、四天，甚至半月、一月的定额，有的一人顶两人用，有的一人顶三人、四人，甚至更多的人用。这是不是仅仅因为他们的体力比别人特别强？当然不能这样说。是的，他们首先是政治挂了帅、鼓足了干劲、提高了劳动强度，这是事实，这也是跃进的一个重要的源泉；然而最主要的还是因为他们比别人更善于把苦干、实干和巧干结合起来，在技术革新和技术革命中做出了更大的成绩。
    目前工业和交通运输战线上的形势蒸蒸日上。8、9、10月份的生产，不但产量逐旬逐月提高，而且一般都做到了高产、优质、低耗和安全生产，多快好省地全面跃进。这种形势可以说是“好得很”。当前，问题是在于把这种“好得很”的形势巩固起来，并且持续不断地发展下去。我们要把目前生产步步高升的常规永远保持下去，要提前和超额完成今年的国家跃进计划，还要在这个基础上做好明年第一季度的生产准备工作，争取明年更好更全面的跃进。为此，我们必须不断扩大和提高生产能力，克服生产中的薄弱环节，要有计划有步骤地进行工业上的技术革命，把目前生产过程中某些环节的手工操作逐步变为机械化或半机械化的操作。怎样才能不断扩大和提高生产能力，才能克服生产的薄弱环节，才能改革手工操作呢？加速建设新企业和增添新设备，自然是很重要的办法；但是在我国目前的条件下应该而且能够采用的更主要的办法，还是依靠广大职工群众在各个战线、各个企业、各个工序上，改进设备，改进工具，改进生产方法，挖掘现有设备能力，加强薄弱环节，把增产节约的群众运动和技术革新结合起来。同时，通过群众性的技术改革活动，自力更生地使手工操作逐步机械化，减少工人的笨重体力劳动，提高他们的劳动效率。
    人的体力再强也是有一定限度的，只有劳而无逸是不能持久的。而技术革新和技术革命是提高劳动生产率的最重要的源泉，它的潜力是无穷无尽的。因为科学技术的发展是永无止境的，技术革新和技术革命的天地是无限辽阔。以技术革新和技术革命为增产节约运动的主要方法和主要内容，把千百万职工群众的冲天干劲，引导到技术革新和技术革命上面来，不断地以新技术、新经验代替旧技术、旧经验，才能做到产量、质量、成本、安全样样跃进，做到劳逸结合，步步上升。增产节约运动才能持续不断地开展下去，保证今后更好更全面地继续跃进。
    把技术革新和技术革命进一步开展起来的关键，在于继续发扬千百万群众的破除迷信、敢想敢干的共产主义风格。没有这种共产主义的英雄风格，群众性的技术革新运动就不可能蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。当然，我们提倡的敢想敢干要是和科学分析的态度密切结合起来的敢想敢干，是技术革新方面的革命的和科学的胆略。一切科学技术原理都来源于实践。因此我们应当根据实践的发展，敢于想前人所不敢想的事，敢于做前人所不能做的事，大胆地革新技术，丰富和修改那些落后于实践、已经过时了的原理和结论。当然，对于每一项革新，都应当经过科学试验。一切经过试验，这就是我们在技术革新和技术革命中的科学分析的态度。一些重大的技术上的发明创造，除了在实验室试验成功外，还应当经过中间工厂的试验，确实证明具有科学上的价值和经济上的价值以后再正式运用到大规模的生产中去。重视科学试验，目的是为了改革得更好，收效更大，它和敢想敢干的独创精神是完全不矛盾的。我们强调技术上的改革必须经过试验，就是因为任何一种改革都有成功和遭受挫折甚至失败的两种可能，有的一经试验就可能成功，有的甚至要经过很多次失败才能成功，但是即使失败多少次也是不可怕的，因为失败是成功之母。当然，在技术革新和技术革命的过程中，特别是当某项革新并不那么顺利的时候，那些有右倾保守思想的人，一定会起来指手划脚，给群众泼冷水，泄群众的气。因此，为了更好地开展技术革新和技术革命，必须加强党的领导，加强政治挂帅，进一步反右倾、鼓干劲，鼓励群众敢想敢干刻苦钻研，不怕困难，反复试验，不怕失败，百折不回，勇猛前进。
    把技术革新和技术革命的群众运动进一步开展起来，是不是仅仅限于自己的创造和发明呢？不是的。创造和发明，犹如在一个从来没有人走过的地方开辟道路一样，把生产技术提高到一个新的境界，这无疑是非常重要的。但是，除此以外，推广别人创造和发明的新技术、新经验，也是属于技术革新和技术革命的范畴。因为任何新技术、新经验，虽然是成功的，可是如果只是少数人会运用这些新技术、新经验，而多数人仍然在使用旧技术、旧经验，那末仍然不能达到普遍地提高生产力的目的。推广新技术、新经验，跟创造发明一样，都需要思想解放，需要有勇于改革的精神、满足于自己熟悉的一套，不善于接受别人的新技术、新经验，故步自封，同样是不利于开展增产节约运动，是我们所应当反对的。
    去年大跃进以来广大职工群众在技术革新和技术革命中所提出的许许多多合理化建议，所创造的许许多多新技术和新经验，其中很多都是非常有价值，非常宝贵的。它们大大丰富和发展了我们的生产实践和科学技术原理。这些新技术、新经验，不少已经得到广泛的推广，不仅在一个企业内使用，而且在整个行业、甚至全国范围内使用，有力地推动了生产的发展。但是，也有不少很有价值的新技术、新经验还没有得到很好的推广，甚至还没有在生产中使用，或者使用了一阵又被搁下了。要问原因，有的是新技术、新经验本身还有些缺点，不那么尽善尽美；有的是企业里推广先进技术和经验的领导工作没跟上去，形成了自流。新技术、新经验暂时不够完善，是毫不奇怪的。任何技术革新和技术革命的创举，并不是一蹴而就的。特别是重大的技术改革，往往要经过反复试验、反复改进才能成功。这是因为人们对于客观事物的认识，对于客观规律的掌握，从不知到知，从知之不多到知之较多，从比较肤浅到比较深刻，都要有一个实践的过程。职工群众在技术革新和技术革命中，一定要有不达目的誓不罢休的勇气和决心。企业的领导同志，对于职工群众的技术改革建议，一定要给以热情的支持。每一个企业一定要把总结、提高和推广职工群众的技术革新和技术革命的创举，当作一项十分重要的组织工作来做，帮助新生事物成长。无论是总结、提高或者推广，都要有专人负责，同时又要依靠群众。这一方面，像鞍山钢铁公司第三炼钢厂创造的技术表演竞赛就是一个好的经验。这种针对生产中的关键问题，采用现场表演、观摩的形式，边说、边做、边教、边试验、边鉴定、边总结、边推广的方法，有效地把理论与实践密切结合起来，把提高技术与解决生产关键密切结合起来，把推广新技术、新经验与劳动竞赛结合起来，把集中领导和大搞群众运动结合起来。各地应当效法从去年的大跃进以来出现的许多推广新技术新经验的良好的方法和形式，使我们技术革新的每一项好的成就，都迅速为更多的人所掌握和运用，迅速成为全民的财产。
    没有轰轰烈烈的群众运动，就没有大跃进；没有群众性的技术革新和技术革命，增产节约的群众运动就不能持续发展。为了高速度地发展社会主义建设事业，职工同志们要继续解放思想，继续发扬敢想敢干和科学分析相结合的共产主义风格，永远做技术革新和技术革命的闯将！
