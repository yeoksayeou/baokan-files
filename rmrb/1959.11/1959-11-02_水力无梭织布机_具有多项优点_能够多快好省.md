    Water-Powered Shuttleless Loom
    Has Many Advantages, Able to Achieve More, Faster, Better, and More Economically
    The Czechoslovakian shuttleless loom is not unfamiliar to the Chinese people, and its appearance once aroused widespread interest among our working masses. To understand its recent developments, we recently visited the Korola shuttleless loom factory in Liberec Region, Czechoslovakia.
    Liberec Region is located in northwestern Czechoslovakia and is the center of the textile industry and textile machinery manufacturing. The Korola factory is located in the Semily district of the region. The car left Prague and soon entered the mountains, winding through the towering mountains. Although the road was winding and twisting, the tall buildings of the factory could be seen from afar.
    The weaving workshop of the factory was bright and clean, and the brand-new machines were arranged neatly in rows, appearing exceptionally quiet, completely lacking the noisy sounds of ordinary textile workshops. A workshop with 1,800 spindles only had two workers on duty. One worker could be responsible for watching seven to fourteen machines or for maintaining thirty-two machine tools. Moreover, a new worker only needed about a month of training to master the operating techniques. This new type of shuttleless loom was produced in Czechoslovakia in the last two years and is entirely water-powered. It has many advantages over the common Benninger shuttle loom, truly achieving "more, faster, better, and more economically."
    The water-powered shuttleless loom can produce various nylon products (including Kapron). Each machine can weave forty to sixty meters of fabric per shift. With the same fabric width, the water-powered shuttleless loom can insert weft threads 350 times per minute, while the Benninger shuttle loom can only shuttle 156 times. For every 1,000 meters of fabric woven, the water-powered shuttleless loom can save 29 units of manpower and 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity compared to the shuttle loom. According to calculations, the amount of fabric produced daily by a worker using a water-powered shuttleless loom exceeds the output of a worker using a shuttle loom by a factor of one.
    The water-powered shuttleless loom not only doubles the labor productivity compared to the Benninger loom, but also saves 40% of investment when building a factory with the same production capacity. Moreover, the products are of strong texture and have bright and beautiful colors.
    Czechoslovakia is currently the only country that produces this water-powered shuttleless loom in large quantities. It not only fully meets the needs of its own textile industry but also exports to countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Czechoslovakia's textile machinery manufacturing industry has developed rapidly after liberation, increasing fifty-nine times from 1945 to 1957. In the past two years, with the reorganization of the national economy, the output of textile machinery has increased by more than 30%. By 1965, its production will be doubled on the existing basis.

### 水力无梭织布机  具有多项优点·能够多快好省

    水力无梭织布机
    具有多项优点·能够多快好省
    捷克斯洛伐克的无梭织布机对于中国人民是并不陌生的，它的出现曾激起我国劳动群众的广泛兴趣。为了了解它近年来的发展，我们日前访问了捷克斯洛伐克的利伯列茨州的柯洛拉无梭织布工厂。
    利伯列茨州位于捷克斯洛伐克西北部，是纺织工业和纺织机器制造业的中心，柯洛拉工厂座落于该州的塞米里县。汽车从布拉格出发不久，就进入山区，蜿蜒行驶于崇山峻岭之中。虽然道路迂回曲折，但很远就可看见工厂的高大建筑了。
    工厂的织布车间明亮清洁，崭新的机器一排排地整齐安放着，显得异常安静，完全没有普通纺织车间那种嘈杂声音。一个一千八百纱锭的车间只有两个工人值班，一个工人可以负责看管七至十四部机器，或负责维修三十二台机床，而且一个新工人只需经过一月左右的训练，就能掌握操作技术。这种新型的无梭织布机是捷克斯洛伐克最近两年生产的，完全用水力带动纱线。它比通用的本林格有梭织布机有许多优点，真正做到了“多快好省”。
    水力无梭织布机能生产各种尼龙产品（包括卡布龙），一部机器每班能织布四十到六十米。布面宽度相同，水力无梭织布机每分钟可投线三百五十次，而本林格有梭织布机仅能穿梭一百五十六次。每织一千米布，水力无梭织布机可以比有梭织布机节约二十九个人力和一百度的电力。根据计算，一个水力无梭织布机的工人，每天所生产的布要超过一个有梭织布机工人的产量一倍。
    水力无梭织布机不单是比本林格织布机提高了一倍劳动生产率，而且当建设一个同样生产能力的工厂时，还能节约40％的投资。而且产品质地坚韧、色彩鲜艳美观。
    捷克斯洛伐克目前是大批生产这种水力无梭织布机的唯一国家，它不仅充分满足本国纺织工业的需要，而且输往亚、非和拉丁美洲国家。捷克斯洛伐克纺织机器制造业是解放后才迅速发展壮大的，1957年比1945年提高了五十九倍；近二年来，随着国民经济的改组，纺织机械的产量又增长了30％以上。到1965年时，它的生产还将在现有基础上提高两倍。
