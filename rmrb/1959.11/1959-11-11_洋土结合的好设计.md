Good Design Combining Foreign and Indigenous Methods
　　Jin Xuan

Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, in March and April of 1958, the Beijing Black Metallurgical Design Institute used just one and a half months to produce a complete set of designs for a small seamless steel tube factory that combined foreign and indigenous methods. This factory can produce 10,000 to 15,000 tons of seamless steel tubes with diameters from 10 mm to 76 mm annually. The equipment for the entire factory is relatively simple, with a total weight not exceeding 150 tons, and can be manufactured by general domestic machinery factories. The total investment in basic construction for the entire factory is only 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. From equipment manufacturing, construction, and installation to putting it into production, it only takes four to five months. Due to its advantages of low investment, high output, good product quality, and simple operation and equipment, this design was quickly adopted throughout the country. Now, many small seamless steel tube factories built according to this design are working together with Anshan Iron and Steel's automated seamless steel tube factory, playing an important role in the socialist construction of the motherland.

Resolutely Walking on Two Legs

When seamless steel tubes are mentioned, people immediately think of Anshan Iron and Steel's automated seamless steel tube factory. The complete set of complex, automated operating machines in this factory can produce more than 100,000 tons of seamless steel tubes annually. This kind of high-speed, mechanized, and automated seamless steel tube factory is indeed very good. However, its construction time is relatively long, and we cannot manufacture a large number of highly mechanized and automated equipment all at once. With the rapid development of socialist construction, the demand for seamless steel tubes is increasing, requiring millions of tons annually. Relying solely on the construction of automated seamless steel tube factories cannot meet the demand.

What to do? The Party Group of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry instructed to take revolutionary measures, resolutely implement the Party's policy of "walking on two legs," liberate thought, break down outdated rules and regulations, and quickly design and build small seamless steel tube factories that combined foreign and indigenous methods.

The Beijing Black Metallurgical Design Institute immediately formed a design team and dispatched people overnight to Shanghai and the Northeast to "learn from experience" on-site. Design work also began within the institute. Those who went to Shanghai were to learn from the experience of the Shanghai Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory. The workers of this factory, using old factory buildings and their own creative and relatively simple equipment, could produce 7,000 to 10,000 tons of seamless steel tubes for the country each year. This is a red banner for developing the seamless steel tube industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Combining Learning and Creation

Upon entering the Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory, one could see that the factory buildings located in the alley were so simple and crude, and the production tools were simple equipment created by the workers themselves, but they were able to produce seamless steel tubes of excellent quality. The construction of this factory had neither ready-made design drawings nor the participation of technical personnel. The workers, seeing the country's urgent need for seamless steel tubes, decided to create their own machines capable of producing seamless steel tubes. They studied and pondered day and night and finally made the machines and produced seamless steel tubes.

The workers' attitude of being masters of their own affairs and their daring and proactive communist style deeply moved the designers, further liberated their thinking, strengthened their confidence, and spurred them to greater efforts. With the help of the factory's Party branch and the workers, they carefully studied the operation process and equipment structural characteristics and made on-site measurements. The workers also enthusiastically provided detailed introductions based on their operating experience regarding areas where the structure of the piercing mill needed further improvement. To make the design more in line with actual production needs, they repeatedly studied with the workers on the spot and rushed to produce sketches overnight. This laid a good foundation for the entire design.

The team that went to the Northeast also collected detailed information on tube rolling mills. Through on-site learning, the designers gained confidence, and the design方案案案案案案案案案案案案案案方案 was successfully determined in less than a week.

In the design process, the designers resolutely responded to the Party organization's call to "seize every second, cooperate with each other, and break the rules," breaking through many outdated rules and regulations in the design work, with all specialties advancing simultaneously and accomplishing the task in one go. Design personnel from the electrical power, steel rolling, and equipment specialties gathered together to research and discuss the determination of key technical conditions and adopted the "comparison method" to quickly resolve technical issues. Design personnel from civil engineering and industrial furnace specialties actively cooperated, eliminating the past practice of submitting overly cumbersome design task books and performing excessive calculations. The equipment design specialty had the largest workload, so they worked hard and cleverly, designing the piercing mill in fifteen days and the automatic tube rolling mill in thirty days. In the past, designing such equipment would take at least three months. In terms of process design, they absorbed the experience of the Yongxin factory and adopted a relatively simple cold drawing process to replace the leveling, sizing, and reduction processes commonly used in general seamless steel tube factories. Because the finished product had undergone a cold drawing process, it had advantages that general hot-rolled tubes did not have, such as a wide variety, precise dimensions, high quality, and high mechanical strength. They also absorbed the experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Factory and added an automatic tube rolling mill to the equipment compared to the Yongxin factory. In this way, the hollow tube after piercing by the piercing mill would then be rolled by the automatic tube rolling mill, which would overcome the phenomenon of excessive and uneven wall thickness, reduce the number of cold drawing passes by half, and reduce cold drawing metal consumption by about half, thereby reducing production costs and improving output and quality.

During the equipment design process, they made many improvements based on the experience of various factories. Based on the production experience of the Yongxin factory, they doubled the motor capacity and changed the belt and gear combined transmission mechanism to a reducer transmission mechanism, which doubled the piercing speed, greatly increased the output, and eliminated the heating phenomenon of the mandrel. With reference to the automatic tube rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel, the front and rear auxiliary frames were simplified, and the electric pressing device was changed to manual. In terms of auxiliary equipment, equipment with a lower level of mechanization was adopted. The factory buildings adopted a brick and wood structure, saving the use of steel and cement, and greatly reducing the investment in basic construction. Through this design, the personnel of this design team carried out a revolution in design thinking and design methods, achieving a double harvest in thought and work.

"Small Seamless" Blossoms Everywhere

"Walking on two legs," combining foreign and indigenous methods, is one of the important policies of socialist construction in our country, but some people who favor foreign things and bigness once criticized and accused it. Some people believed that the design of the 76 mm diameter seamless steel tube factory was "too indigenous" and the equipment was "too simple." Others doubted, "How can such simple factories and equipment roll out seamless steel tubes?" Faced with cynicism, a few people who personally participated in the design also wavered. They only saw the individual and temporary shortcomings in the design and hurriedly paled in fear and shouted, "The design is terrible," and "The problems are thorny." At this time, the Party committee of the design institute came forward to give new things cordial care and support, organized the design personnel into several groups, and went to the site to participate in equipment manufacturing, construction commissioning, and production, and the individual shortcomings in the design were quickly resolved. They also helped various places solve many problems encountered in manufacturing, construction, and trial rolling. Comrade Chen Yun gave a high evaluation of the design of the 76 mm diameter seamless steel tube factory in his article "Several Major Issues in the Current Basic Construction Work," which gave a head-on blow to those who pointed fingers and had right-leaning thoughts. From then on, cold winds and hot tides disappeared, and rumors and slanders vanished. One by one, seamless steel tube factories were put into production, and batches of seamless steel tubes flew to the front line of the motherland's production and construction.

At the end of 1958, Shanghai, Chongqing, Hengyang and other places rolled out seamless steel tubes. Now, more than 40 seamless steel tube factories are being built across the country, and more than 20 have been put into production. Dalian Steel Tube Factory also used the equipment in this set of designs to trial-roll high-grade alloy steel tubes such as ball bearing steel. The design of the 76 mm diameter seamless steel tube factory that combines foreign and indigenous methods shines brightly and is full of splendor. This is a victory for the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and a victory for the policy of walking on two legs, combining foreign and indigenous methods!

    洋土结合的好设计
    金宣
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，1958年3、4月间，北京黑色冶金设计总院用短短一个半月的时间，做出了一个洋土结合的小型无缝钢管厂的整套设计。这个厂每年能生产一万至一万五千吨直径十毫米到七十六毫米的无缝钢管。全厂设备比较简单，总重不超过一百五十吨，国内一般机械厂都能制造，全厂基本建设投资只要七、八十万元。从设备制造、施工、安装到投入生产，只要四、五个月的时间。由于它具有投资少、产量高、产品质量好和操作、设备简单等优点，这个设计很快为全国各地所采用。现在，按这个设计建设起来的许多小型无缝钢管厂正和鞍钢的自动化无缝钢管厂一起，在祖国的社会主义建设中发挥着重要的作用。
    坚决用两条腿走路
    一谈到无缝钢管，人们立刻就会联想到鞍钢的自动化无缝钢管厂。这个厂的一整套复杂的自动化操作的机器，一年就能生产十余万吨无缝钢管。这种高速度机械化自动化的无缝钢管厂确是很好。但是它的建设时间比较长，高度机械化自动化的设备，我们一下子也不能制造出很多来。随着社会主义建设的飞跃发展，无缝钢管的需要量愈来愈大了，每年需要成百万吨。仅仅依靠建设自动化无缝钢管厂是不能满足需要的。
    怎么办？冶金工业部党组指示要采取革命措施，坚决贯彻党的“两条腿走路”的方针，解放思想，打破清规戒律，迅速设计和建设洋土结合的小型无缝钢管厂。
    北京黑色冶金设计总院马上成立了设计小组，连夜派人一路去上海，一路奔东北，到现场去“取经”。院内也开始设计。到上海去的，是要学习上海永鑫无缝钢管厂的经验。这个厂的职工利用旧厂房和自己创造的比较简单的设备，每年能为国家生产七千到一万吨的无缝钢管。这是多快好省地发展无缝钢管工业的一面红旗。
    学习和创造相结合
    一走进永鑫无缝钢管厂，只见座落在弄堂里的厂房是那样的简陋，生产工具就是工人自己创造的简易设备，但是能生产出质量优良的无缝钢管。这座工厂的建设，既无现成设计图纸，又无技术人员参加。工人们看到国家迫切需要无缝钢管，就决定自己创造一套能生产无缝钢管的机器。他们日夜钻研琢磨，终于制成了机器，生产出了无缝钢管。
    工人同志们的主人翁的劳动态度，敢想敢干的共产主义风格，使设计人员深受感动，使他们进一步解放了思想，加强了信心，鼓起了更大的干劲。在工厂党支部和工人们的帮助下，他们详细研究了操作过程和设备结构特点，并作了现场测绘。工人们还热情地根据操作经验，对穿孔机在结构等方面需要进一步改进的地方做了详细的介绍。为了使设计更切合实际生产的需要，他们就地同工人一起反复研究，连夜赶制草图。这就为整个设计打下了良好的基础。
    去东北的小组也详细收集了轧管机的资料。通过到现场学习，设计人员心中有了底，不到一个星期，设计方案就顺利地确定了。
    在设计过程中，设计人员坚决响应了党组织提出的“分秒必争，互相协作，打破常规”的战斗口号，冲破设计工作中的许多清规戒律，各专业齐头并进，一气呵成。电力、轧钢、设备等专业设计人员同聚一堂，研究讨论确定主要技术条件，并且采取“对比法”使技术问题能很快解决。土木建筑、工业炉等专业设计人员主动协作配合，破除了过去那种互相依次提交过于繁琐的设计任务书和进行过多计算的常规。设备设计专业部分的工作量最大，他们就苦干加巧干，十五天设计出穿孔机，三十天设计出自动轧管机。而过去设计这样的设备最快也得三个月以上。在工艺设计方面，吸取了永鑫厂的经验，采用了比较简易的冷拔工序代替一般无缝钢管厂所采用的均整、定径、减轻等工序；成品由于经过了冷拔工序，因而具有一般热轧管所不及的品种多、尺寸精确、质量高、机械强度大等优点。他们还吸取了鞍钢无缝钢管厂的经验，比永鑫厂的设备增加了一台自动轧管机。这样圆棒经过穿孔机穿孔后的荒管再经过自动轧管机的轧制，就克服了管壁过厚和壁厚不匀的现象，就能减少冷拔工序一半的拔制道次，降低冷拔金属消耗约一半，既降低了生产成本，又提高了产量和质量。
    在设备设计的过程中，他们综合各厂的经验作了许多改进。他们根据永鑫厂的生产经验，将马达容量加大两倍，将皮带及齿轮综合传动机构改为减速机传动机构，使穿孔速度提高了一倍，产量大大增加，顶头的发热现象也消除了。在参考鞍钢自动轧管机的基础上，简化了前后辅助台架，将电动压下装置改为手动。在辅助设备方面，则采用机械化水平较低的设备。厂房采用了砖木结构，节约了钢材、水泥的用量，使基本建设投资大大降低。通过这一设计，这个设计小组的人员进行了一次设计思想、设计方法的革命，思想、工作双丰收。
    “小无缝”到处开花结果
    “洋土并举”是我国社会主义建设的重要方针之一，有些喜洋好大的人却曾非难指责它。有人认为：直径七十六毫米无缝钢管厂的设计“太土了”，设备“太简单了”；有人怀疑：“这样简单的工厂和设备，怎么能轧出无缝钢管来呢？”在冷嘲热讽面前，个别亲自参加设计的人也动摇了。他们只看到设计中的个别的暂时的缺点，便仓惶失色地跟着喊叫“设计很糟糕”，“问题很辣手”。这时，设计院党委出来给了新生事物以亲切的关怀和扶植，组织设计人员组成几个小组，分头下现场参加设备制造、施工试运转和生产等工作，设计上的个别缺点很快得到了解决。他们还帮助各地解决了许多制造、施工、试轧中遇到的问题。陈云同志在“当前基本建设工作中的几个重大问题”一文中，对直径七十六毫米无缝钢管厂设计作了很高的评价，更给了那些指手划脚有右倾思想的人以迎头痛击。从此，冷风热潮烟消云散，流言蜚语消声匿迹。一个个无缝钢管厂投入了生产，成批的无缝钢管飞奔到祖国生产建设前线去。
    1958年底，上海、重庆、衡阳等地都轧出了无缝钢管。现在，全国各地正在建设四十余个无缝钢管厂，并有二十余个投入了生产。大连钢管厂还用这套设计中的设备，试轧出了滚珠轴承钢等高级合金钢管。洋土结合的直径七十六毫米无缝钢管厂的设计大放光明，大放异彩。这是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是洋土并举两条腿走路方针的胜利！
