    Eliminate Pests to Protect Production
    In mountainous areas across the country, militias are organizing hunting teams to eliminate pests, protect production, and ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture.
    In Guangxi, militias, through division of labor, contracted responsibilities, guarding passes by sections, and a combination of indigenous and modern methods, have eliminated more than 361,000 various pests in the past five months. In the Yidu area of Hubei, more than 2,500 hunting teams have been formed, eliminating 100,000 pests of various kinds, including more than 200 tigers, leopards, jackals, and bears. The hunting team of the Jiu Mu People's Commune in Pucheng County, Fujian Province, known as the "Sharpshooter Team," often travels under the stars and moonlight, climbs mountains and crosses rivers, and ventures deep into the dense forests to hunt ferocious beasts, turning dozens of mountain villages around, which have suffered from pests for years, into basically pest-free villages.

    An Eight Hundred Jin Sea Turtle
    The Marine Fishing Brigade of the Dagu People's Commune in Tanggu District, Tianjin, caught a large sea turtle on October 26 at the estuary of the Daqing River in Bohai Bay.
    This sea turtle is about 1.5 meters long and weighs more than 800 jin. Its eyes are as big as eggs, and its snake-like mouth is about two centimeters long when closed. Different from ordinary sea turtles, it has two limbs in addition to its four feet, allowing it to swim freely. This kind of sea turtle has rarely been seen in the Bohai area in the past.

    天津市塘沽区大沽人民公社海洋捕捞大队，十月二十六日在渤海湾大清河海口处捕获一只大海龟。
    这只海龟长一米五左右，重八百多斤。它的眼睛有鸡蛋那么大，像蛇似的嘴巴闭着时约有二厘米长。它与普通海龟不同，除了四脚外，还有两肢，游动自如。这种海龟过去在渤海一带很少见到。
