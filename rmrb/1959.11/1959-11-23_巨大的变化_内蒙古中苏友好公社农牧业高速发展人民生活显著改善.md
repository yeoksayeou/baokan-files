Great Changes

——Rapid Development of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry and Significant Improvement of People's Lives in the Inner Mongolia China-Soviet Friendship People's Commune
Hu Zhaoheng

The China-Soviet Friendship People's Commune (formerly Huerle Township) in Zhalantun Banner, Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia, has decided to deliver 9,239 tons of grain and surplus grain to the state this year, averaging 1,411 jin per agricultural person, doubling the amount delivered last year. This is a major contribution to the socialist motherland!

The China-Soviet Friendship People's Commune has undulating hills, crisscrossing rivers, lush forests, and fertile water and grass. The commune has more than 2,800 households with over 15,600 people (agricultural population accounts for over 13,000), mainly a gathering area for Mongolian brothers.

Over the past ten years since liberation, earth-shaking changes have taken place here. Taking the paddy field management area as an example, each farmer will sell an average of 1,870 jin of grain to the state this year. More than twenty years ago, people here didn't know how to farm; ten years ago, cultivation was extensive and yields were negligible! Now? Here, not only are miscellaneous grains and wheat grown, but also canals are opened to grow rice, and the "Eight-Character Charter" is implemented. In particular, relying on the collective strength of the People's Commune, the disasters of spring drought, summer insects, and autumn floods this year were overcome, and a great agricultural harvest was achieved. In 1949, the average yield per mu in Huerle Township was only 110 jin; this year, the yield per mu is 240 jin. The total output increased by 167% in ten years. These numbers are truly encouraging!

When the Qianjin (Forward) Animal Husbandry Brigade established mutual aid teams in 1955, there were more than 4,700 livestock here. When the People's Commune was established in 1958, the net increase in livestock was 19.7%. This year, the net increase in livestock is 42.5%. The total number of livestock has now increased to more than 10,500. In just four years, the number of livestock has more than doubled. The income of herdsmen has also increased greatly: in 1949, the average income per person was 16 yuan; this year, each labor day can be divided into 1.7 yuan. The situation in other animal husbandry brigades is similar. In 1958, the whole commune sold 40,000 jin of sheep wool, 2,500 jin of goat cashmere, 110,000 jin of beef and mutton, and 80,000 jin of milk to the state; this year, it sold 70,000 jin of sheep wool, 3,100 jin of goat cashmere, 150,000 jin of beef and mutton, and 120,000 jin of milk to the state.

In 1957, there was only one blacksmith's shop here. To shoe a horse, one had to go to Yinde'er or Ulanhot. Last year, after communization, 23 factories were established on their own, including a farm implement repair factory, a milk powder factory, a clothing factory, a wool processing factory, a lime factory, a leather factory, a brick and tile factory, a winery, a woodworking factory, and a tinware factory. The industrial output value in the first three quarters of this year reached more than 160,000 yuan.

Forestry, fishery, and sideline production have also developed greatly.

With the development of production, people's lives have undergone significant changes. According to the materials of the Huerle Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative: in 1949, a piece of twill cloth, priced at 6 jiao per chi (Chinese foot), was still unsold after two years; on September 29 this year, five pi (bolts) of corduroy, priced at 1.2 yuan per shi chi (market foot), were sold in one day. Let’s talk about housing. Taking Sha’ergetai Village as an example, this village has 134 households, and 114 rooms were built this year.

When elementary cooperatives were established, even an accountant could not be found here. Now there are 42 primary schools and one commune-run middle school, with 95% of school-age children enrolled. There are 60 rural literacy schools, with more than 5,000 young and middle-aged farmers and herdsmen enrolled.

What deserves special mention is the growth of the population. In 1949, the Mongolian population in the east township was more than 10,300; now, the Mongolian population is more than 15,300, an increase of nearly 50% in ten years. Baiyinhua Village has 227 people, including 111 children under the age of ten. The population of this village has almost doubled in ten years. For ethnic minorities, what an exciting change this is!

How is the daily increase in production and life achieved?

It is because the Party led the Mongolian people to establish an autonomous region; it is because the Party led the people to overthrow the cruel feudal exploitation and realize the land revolution; it is because the Party led the people to embark on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation, production took a step forward, and life was initially improved; it is because the Party led the people to realize communization, which has made production even greater and life even better.

After communization, the whole commune established 61 canteens, and none of them have been disbanded so far. More than 1,000 female laborers were liberated, and they participated in agricultural and animal husbandry production, and a large number of production experts were cultivated.

The commune has strong capital. They have accumulated 150,000 yuan and plan to buy tractors and build hydropower stations next year.

The commune implements a supply system for food. In the past, households that suffered great difficulties due to a large population and few laborers, or due to birth, old age, illness, and death, were relieved of their burdens, and their lives rapidly improved. People's enthusiasm for production has undoubtedly been enhanced!

How can all the benefits of the commune be described in a short time! Looking at the whole country from one commune, our People's Communes are like a delicate rising sun, shining on the great rivers and mountains of the motherland.

    巨大的变化
    ——内蒙古中苏友好公社农牧业高速发展人民生活显著改善
    胡昭衡
    内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟扎赉特旗中苏友好人民公社（即胡尔勒乡），决定全社今年向国家交公粮售余粮九千二百三十九吨，平均每个农业人口交售一千四百十一斤，比去年交售量增加一倍。这对社会主义祖国是一个重大的贡献！
    中苏友好人民公社境内山陵起伏，河流纵横，林木葱郁，水草肥美。全社二千八百多户，一万五千六百多人（农业人口占一万三千多），主要是蒙古族兄弟的聚居区。
    解放十年来，这里起了翻天覆地的变化。以水田管理区为例，今年每个农民平均要向国家出卖一千八百七十斤粮食。而在二十多年前，这里的人还不会种地；十年以前，耕种粗放，产量微不足道！现在呢？这里不仅种杂粮、小麦，而且开渠种水稻，实行了“八字宪法”，特别是依靠人民公社的集体力量，战胜了今年春旱、夏虫、秋涝的灾害，取得了农业大丰收。1949年，胡尔勒乡每亩平均产量，不过一百一十斤，今年每亩产量是二百四十斤。十年间总产量增长167％。这些数字真令人振奋！
    前进牧业大队，1955年建立起牧业互助组时，这里的牲畜共有四千七百多头。1958年成立人民公社时，牲畜纯增19.7％。今年牲畜则纯增42.5％，现在牲畜总头数已发展到一万零五百多头。仅仅四年的功夫，牲畜增长一倍多。牧民收入也随着大大增加：1949年平均每人收入十六元，今年每个劳动日能分到一元七角。其他牧业大队情况也类似。1958年全社卖给国家绵羊毛四万斤，山羊绒二千五百斤，牛羊肉十一万斤，牛奶八万斤；今年卖给国家绵羊毛七万斤，山羊绒三千一百斤，牛羊肉十五万斤，牛奶十二万斤。
    1957年，这里还只有一个铁匠炉，挂马掌得上音德尔或乌兰浩特。去年公社化，自己办起农具修配厂、乳粉厂、被服厂、羊毛加工厂、石灰厂、皮革厂、砖瓦厂、酒厂、木工厂以及白铁业厂二十三座，今年前三个季度工业产值即达十六万余元。
    林业渔业和副业生产也有很大的发展。
    随着生产发展，人民生活有了显著的变化。据胡尔勒乡供销社材料：1949年一匹斜纹布，每尺六角，卖了两年还没卖完；今年9月29日，一天就卖出了每市尺一元二角的灯心绒五匹。再说说住房吧，就以沙尔圪台屯为例，这个屯一百三十四户，今年就盖了一百一十四间房子。
    建初级社时，这里连会计也找不到。现在有四十二所小学和一所社办中学，适龄儿童入学的占95％。农村民校六十处，入校青壮年农牧民五千多名。
    值得大书特书的是人口的增长。1949年，东乡蒙古族人口一万零三百余人；现在，蒙古族人口一万五千三百余人，十年增加人口接近50％。白音花屯二百二十七口人，其中十岁以下孩子一百一十一口人，十年中这个屯的人口增加近一倍。对于少数民族，这是多么激动人心的变化！
    生产生活日日上升是怎样得来的呢？
    是党领导蒙古族人民建立了自治区；是党领导人民推翻了残酷的封建剥削，实现了土地革命；是党领导人民走上了互助合作的道路，生产向前进了一步，生活得到了初步的改善；是党领导人民实现了公社化，使生产有了更大的发展，生活有了更大的改善。
    公社化后，全社办了六十一个食堂，至今一个没散，解放了一千多个妇女劳动力，她们参加了农牧业生产，并且培养出来大量生产能手。
    公社资金雄厚，他们积累了十五万元，准备明年买拖拉机，建水电站。
    公社伙食实行供给制的办法，过去因为人口多劳力少、或者因为生老病死感受着重大困难的户解除了负担，生活迅速上升，人们搞生产的劲头无异于添上了翅膀！
    公社的好处，哪能一时就说得完呢！由一个公社看全国，我们的人民公社正像娇艳的旭日，照耀着祖国的大好河山。
