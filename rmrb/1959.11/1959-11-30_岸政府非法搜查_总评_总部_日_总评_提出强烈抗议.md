    Kishi Government Illegally Searches "Sohyo" Headquarters
    Japanese "Sohyo" Lodges Strong Protest
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th -- The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) today issued a statement strongly protesting the Kishi Nobusuke government's police authorities for searching its headquarters.
    The statement said that the Kishi Nobusuke government, under the pretext of the "Public Safety Ordinance," which had long been judged by the court as unconstitutional, forcefully searched the Sohyo headquarters. This is a fascist suppression, the purpose of which is to implement the military line stipulated in the revised Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
    The statement said that we will never yield to any suppression. For the sake of Japan's democracy and peace, we will fight with even greater confidence.
    The Kishi Nobusuke government's police authorities conducted the search of this union late last night. This search is part of the Kishi Nobusuke government's all-out suppression of progressive organizations participating in the unified action after the Japanese people held their eighth unified action against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" on the 27th.
    Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, successively delivered speeches in Osaka and Kobe today, expressing firm opposition to the Kishi Nobusuke government's attempt to formulate laws to deprive the people of their rights to petition and demonstrate.

    岸政府非法搜查“总评”总部
    日“总评”提出强烈抗议
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天发表声明，强烈抗议岸信介政府的警察当局搜查它的总部。
    声明说，岸信介政府假借早已被法院判决为违反宪法的“公安条例”，强硬地搜查总评议会总部，这是一种法西斯镇压，其目的是为了实行修改后的日美“安全条约”所规定的军事路线。
    声明说，我们决不屈服于任何镇压，为了日本的民主与和平，我们要更有信心地进行斗争。
    岸信介政府警察当局在昨天深夜对这个工会进行了搜查。这次搜查是岸信介政府在日本人民27日举行反对修改日美“安全条约”的第八次统一行动以后，大肆镇压参加统一行动的进步组织的行动的一部分。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎今天在大阪和神户接连发表谈话，表示坚决反对岸信介政府企图制定法律来剥夺人民请愿、示威的权利。
