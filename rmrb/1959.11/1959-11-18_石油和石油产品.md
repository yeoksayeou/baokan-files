    Petroleum and Petroleum Products
    Petroleum is a yellow or dark brown liquid fuel. There are two types: natural petroleum and synthetic petroleum. Whether natural or synthetic, petroleum must undergo a series of processing steps to produce usable products. Petroleum can be processed into thousands of different products.
    Some petroleum products are fuels, such as gasoline, diesel, and kerosene. Others are various lubricating oils, such as lubricating oil or grease for bicycles, carts, automobiles, tractors, trains, generators, etc. There are also many types that are not lubricants, such as oil used as insulation in transformers and oil switches, oil for cosmetics, medicinal petroleum jelly, oil for baking bread, etc.
    After refining, petroleum also yields paraffin wax and asphalt as industrial raw materials, as well as petroleum coke, carbon black, and chemical products.
    It is difficult to list all the uses of petroleum at once. What has been mentioned above is only a very small part of petroleum products.

    石油和石油产品
    石油是一种黄色或深褐色的液体燃料。有天然石油和人造石油两种。无论天然石油或人造石油，都需要经过一系列的加工过程才能得出合用的产品来。石油经过各种加工方法，可以获得几千种产品。
    石油的产品，一部分是燃料，就是汽油、柴油和煤油；另一部分是各种润滑用的油料，如自行车、大车、汽车、拖拉机、火车、发电机等都需要用的润滑油或润滑脂。另外还有很多种不属于润滑性质的，例如变压器、油开关内作为绝缘用的油、化妆品用油、医药用凡士林、烤面包用的油等等。
    石油经炼制以后，还有作为工业原料的石蜡和沥青，有石油焦、炭黑以及化工产品等。
    石油的用途是很难一下子说完的，上面所说的，不过是石油产品的很小部分。
