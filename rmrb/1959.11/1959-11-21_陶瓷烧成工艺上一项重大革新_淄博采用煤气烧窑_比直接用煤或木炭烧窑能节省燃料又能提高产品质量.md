Zibo Adopts Gas-Fired Kilns

Saves fuel and improves product quality compared to direct coal or charcoal firing.

(Our newspaper, Zibo, 20th) China's ceramic industry has recently completed a major technological reform - gas-fired down-draft kilns and semi-gas-fired up-draft round kilns. This technology has been successfully tested in the Zibo Porcelain Factory and the Boshan Ceramics Factory. It is now officially in production. This technological achievement plays an important role in saving a large amount of fuel, shortening firing time and improving product quality.

The final stage of ceramic production is firing. In the past, several types of ceramic kilns in our country directly burned coal or firewood in the kiln. This firing method has many shortcomings. When adding coal to the kiln, a large amount of cold air enters the kiln, lowering the temperature and increasing coal consumption. At the same time, it is difficult for even the most skilled veteran workers to control the neutral flame in the final stage, which can sometimes cause the fired products to turn yellow or black, making it difficult to guarantee quality. The current gas-fired kiln does not change the original kiln structure, but sets up a gas generator to send the gas into the kiln through pipelines, thus eliminating the various shortcomings of direct coal burning. A set of gas furnaces can fire four to six down-draft kilns, and the kilns can be cycled periodically, with the furnace running continuously even when the kiln is stopped. The semi-gas-fired up-draft round kiln is also suitable for areas without electricity.

Gas-fired kilns have many advantages and can not only fire high-grade daily-use ceramics, but also industrial ceramics and refractory bricks. In terms of saving coal, according to the initial trial firing results, it can save 30% to 50%. The firing time is reduced from forty-two to forty-eight hours to twenty-eight hours. Gas-fired kilns can easily control the temperature inside the kiln, and the oxidizing flame, reducing flame, and neutral flame can be freely adjusted and maintained consistently. This guarantees product quality.

The gas-fired down-draft kiln is a product of the Great Leap Forward and the result of the Party's strong leadership and putting politics in command. In the past, people were skeptical that down-draft kilns could burn gas, but the success of the Zibo ceramics industry workers in experimenting with large kilns to make steel during the mass steelmaking campaign last year gave them great inspiration. After many small-scale experiments, this new technology was finally successfully announced at the Zibo Porcelain Factory.

Currently, the Zibo Ceramics Factory already has thirty-nine kilns using gas, and another sixty are under construction. (Attached picture)

    陶瓷烧成工艺上一项重大革新
    淄博采用煤气烧窑
    比直接用煤或木炭烧窑能节省燃料又能提高产品质量
    本报淄博20日电  我国陶瓷工业最近完成了一项重大的技术改革——煤气烧倒焰窑和半煤气烧直焰元窑。这项技术是在山东淄博瓷厂、博山陶瓷厂试验成功的。目前已正式投入生产。这一技术成就，对节约大量燃料，缩短烧成时间，提高产品质量起到了重要的保证作用。
    陶瓷工艺的最后阶段是烧成。以往，我国几种陶瓷窑都是把煤或木柴直接投放到窑内燃烧。这种烧法有很多缺点。由于在向窑内加煤时，大量的冷空气进入窑内，使温度降低，煤耗增加。同时，最末阶段的中性焰即是最熟练的老工人也很难控制，因而有时烧成后的产品发黄、发黑，质量没把握。现在的煤气烧窑，原窑结构不变，只是另设一座煤气发生炉，把煤气用管道送进窑内，这样直接烧煤时的种种缺点就没有了。一组煤气炉能烧四至六个倒焰窑，窑可周期循环，停窑不停炉。而半煤气烧直焰元窑还适用于无电源的地区。
    煤气烧窑的优越性很多，不仅能烧高级日用陶瓷，而且也可以烧工业陶瓷和耐火砖。在节约煤炭方面，以初期试烧的结果计算，能节约30％至50％。烧成时间由四十二至四十八小时降低为二十八小时。煤气烧窑容易控制窑内的温度，氧化焰，还原焰，中性焰都可以自由调节，能始终保持稳定。因而能保证产品质量。
    煤气烧倒焰窑是大跃进的产儿，是党的坚强领导和政治挂帅的结果。过去，人们都迷信倒焰窑不能烧煤气，淄博陶瓷业的职工由于在去年大办钢铁的群众运动中，试验用大窑炼铁获得成功，给他们很大的启发。经过多次的小型试验，这项新技术终于在淄博瓷厂首告成功。
    现在，淄博陶瓷厂已经有了三十九座窑用上煤气，还有六十座正在建设。（附图片）
    看，用煤气烧出的陶瓷多么美！
