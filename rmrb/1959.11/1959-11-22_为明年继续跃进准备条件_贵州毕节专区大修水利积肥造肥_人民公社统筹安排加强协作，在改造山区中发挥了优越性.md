To Prepare Conditions for Continued Leap Forward Next Year
    Bijie Special District, Guizhou, Repairs Water Conservancy, Accumulates and Manufactures Fertilizer
    People's Communes' Overall Planning and Strengthened Collaboration Demonstrate Superiority in Transforming Mountainous Areas
    (Our dispatch) The broad masses of people in the Bijie Special District of Guizhou Province, a high and cold mountainous area, under the leadership of the Party for the past ten years since liberation, have overcome various difficulties and changed the face of the barren mountainous area. Now, in order to build their hometowns into more prosperous and happier places, they are advancing victoriously, leaping forward again and again, and have launched a mass winter production upsurge centered on large-scale water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing. More than three million people of all ethnic groups in the district are determined to work hard throughout the winter and spring to pave the way for continued leap forward next year.
    At present, on more than 4,000 water conservancy construction sites throughout the district, more than 250,000 people are engaged in intense labor every day, and this will soon increase to 400,000. From the district and county Party committees to the communes, management districts, and production teams, water conservancy headquarters have been established at all levels, and the Party secretaries personally take charge and direct the work. The commune members are full of energy, many people are camping on the construction sites, and many have expressed that they will not leave the construction sites until the water conservancy is completed. The 207 backbone projects with a total water storage capacity of 500,000 cubic meters, because they all involved the burden and benefit of several townships or several advanced cooperatives in the past, could not be built during the period of the advanced cooperatives; now, under the overall arrangement of the people's communes, they have all started construction one after another. The largest water conservancy project in the district, the Xixi Reservoir in Qianxi County, needs to occupy 150 mu of land in the Jichang Commune of Dafang County. After consultation between the relevant parties in accordance with the principle of equivalent mutual benefit, the commune members of Jichang Commune happily gave up the land. Now more than 8,000 people are participating in the construction of this site every day. In water conservancy construction, all construction sites are carrying out tool reforms, and more than 22,000 new tools such as wooden rail carts, pulleys, and soil compactors have been promoted throughout the district, greatly improving labor efficiency. At the Songguan Reservoir construction site in Yachi Commune, Bijie County, the five processes of digging, transporting, and ramming have all realized soil mechanization, saving more than 320,000 workdays for the entire project.
    The mass movement of accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer has also been launched vigorously. The 180,000-member fertilizer accumulation professional team in the district has started working together, focusing on large-scale livestock manure collection, combined with digging,沤 (沤, Òu, to soak; to steep; to rot), soaking, sweeping, picking and other methods to accumulate and produce natural fertilizers; at the same time, they are also manufacturing a large amount of native chemical fertilizers, using winter fallow land to plant green manure, and carrying out large-scale smoked soil fertilizer production in combination with deep plowing. More than 3,000 native chemical fertilizer plants have been put into production. The broad masses of commune members also actively participated in the fertilizer accumulation movement. Many commune members bring a handful of grass home after work to pad the pens or use as compost raw materials. From the beginning of this month to now, more than one billion jin of various fertilizers have been accumulated throughout the district. Together with the existing fertilizers, each mu of summer harvest crops has an average of about 2,000 jin of topdressing fertilizer.
    At present, 50,000 people in the district have been put into the soil improvement movement, and 520,000 mu of soil improvement work has been completed. The Yeba Management District of Linquan Commune, Qianxi County, transferred nearly 20% of its labor force to form a professional team to carry out a blitz of soil improvement. At the same time, the deep plowing work of the entire district, as of November 14, has also been basically completed. Generally, the fields are plowed deeply about eight inches, and some are plowed more than one foot deep.
    Under the slogan of "Seize the small season to catch up with the big season," the people of the entire district, while vigorously carrying out water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movements, are also grasping the field management of winter crops. More than 200,000 laborers in the district have been put into field management. All localities have generally established a field management responsibility system and file system, established pacesetters at all levels, conducted regular inspections and evaluations, and widely carried out red flag competitions. At present, more than 340,000 mu of summer harvest crop fields have been weeded, and 210,000 mu of summer harvest crops have been topdressed once; the summer harvest crops that emerged earlier have generally been thinned, replanted, and fixed twice. Therefore, the 430,000 mu of summer harvest crops in the district are growing very well.
    Now the winter production movement in the entire special district is unfolding step by step in depth.

    为明年继续跃进准备条件
    贵州毕节专区大修水利积肥造肥
    人民公社统筹安排加强协作，在改造山区中发挥了优越性
    本报讯　贵州省高寒山区的毕节专区广大人民，解放十年来，在党的领导下，克服各种困难，改变了贫瘠山区的面貌。现在，他们为了把家乡建设得更富饶更幸福，又乘胜向前，跃进再跃进，掀起了以大兴水利和积肥造肥为中心的群众性的冬季生产高潮。全区三百多万各族人民决心大干一冬春，为明年继续跃进铺平道路。
    目前，在全区的四千多处水利工地上，每天都有二十五万多人进行紧张的劳动，不久即将增加到四十万人。从地、县委到公社、管理区和生产队，已层层建立了水利指挥部，并由党委书记亲自挂帅，具体指挥。社员们干劲冲天，许多人在工地上安营扎寨，许多人表示不修好水利就不下工地。总蓄水能力为五十万立方米的二百零七处骨干工程，因都牵涉到原来几个乡或几个高级社的负担和受益问题，在高级社时期无法兴建；现在，在人民公社的统筹安排下均先后破土兴工。全区目前最大的水利工程——黔西县西溪水库需占用大方县鸡场公社一百五十亩土地，经有关方面根据等价互利的精神协商，鸡场公社的社员高高兴兴地把土地让出来。现在这个工地每天有八千多人参加修建。兴修水利中各工地大搞工具改革，全区推广木轨斗车、滑丝、压土机等新工具两万二千多件，大大提高了劳动效率。毕节县鸭池公社宋官水库工地，挖、运、夯等五个工序全部实现了土机械化，使整个工程节约三十二万多个工。
    群众性的积肥造肥运动也轰轰烈烈地展开了。全区十八万人的积肥专业队一齐展开工作，以大搞圈肥为主，结合挖、沤、泡、扫、拣等办法积制自然肥料；同时还大造土化肥，利用冬闲田地种植绿肥，结合深耕大搞熏土肥。目前已有三千多个土化肥厂投入生产。广大社员也积极参加了积肥运动，很多社员收工回家都带一把草来垫圈或者作为堆肥原料。从本月初到现在，全区已积各种肥料十亿多斤，加上原有肥料，每亩夏收作物平均有追肥两千斤左右。
    目前全区已有五万人投入了改良土壤运动，已完成五十二万亩的土壤改良工作。黔西县林泉公社野坝管理区，抽调将近20％的劳动力，组成专业队突击改良土壤。与此同时，全区的深翻土地工作，截至11月14日，也已基本结束，一般田地都深耕八寸左右，有一部分深翻一尺以上。
    在“小季赶大季”的口号下，全区人民在大搞水利积肥运动的同时，大抓越冬作物的田间管理工作。全区有二十多万劳动力投入了田间管理。各地普遍建立田间管理责任制和档案制，层层树立标兵，定期检查评比，广泛开展红旗竞赛。目前已薅耘了夏收作物田地三十四万多亩，并给二十一万多亩夏收作物追施了一道肥料；出土较早的夏收作物，大都进行了两次匀苗、补苗、定苗。因此，全区的四百三十多亩夏收作物成长十分良好。
    现在全专区的冬季生产运动正在步步深入地展开。
