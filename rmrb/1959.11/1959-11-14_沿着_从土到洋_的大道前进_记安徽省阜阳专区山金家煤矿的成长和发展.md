The Victory of "Walking on Two Legs"

"Without walking on two legs, there would be no Shanjinjia Mine." This sentence vividly and profoundly illustrates the process of growth and development of the Shanjinjia Mine in Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui Province.

The Shanjinjia Coal Mine was established during the mass movement of the Great Leap Forward in steel production last year. This place used to be a remote mountain village with sparse population, and the local farmers didn't even know what a coal kiln looked like. However, by the end of last year, it had gradually developed into a small coal mine with an annual output of 100,000 tons. In this process, they did not ask the state for funds, becoming a model of self-reliance and starting from scratch. From January to September this year, this mine has produced more than 67,000 tons of coal for the country; the overall efficiency has increased by more than four times; the cost per ton of coal has decreased by 81%; and the labor force has been reduced by 72%. While producing, they are also building two pairs of small-scale modern (洋法) production shafts. One pair of shafts with an annual output of 50,000 tons was put into production in October; a pair of shafts with an annual output of 150,000 tons is expected to be completed in December this year.

A Broad Path from Indigenous to Foreign

The growth and development of the Shanjinjia Coal Mine has not been smooth sailing. In the process of building the mine, they waged a resolute struggle against various right-leaning conservative ideas. On the issue of how to further improve and develop small coal mines, there were two different views. One group believed that "to open a coal mine, you need foreign machines," and "indigenous methods are not as advanced as foreign methods." The other group believed that "where there is indigenous, there is foreign; foreign methods also come from indigenous methods," "today there is indigenous, tomorrow there will be foreign," and "from indigenous to foreign is a gradual development, not a one-step process." The broad masses of workers at the Shanjinjia Coal Mine realized that if the former approach was adopted, they would only be able to reach out to the state for investment, materials, machines, and technicians, and the state would not be able to solve it completely all at once. Without a doubt, adopting this approach would not be able to seize the time, win high speed, and would not be able to meet the country's need for coal. Therefore, they adopted the approach of self-reliance, first starting with indigenous methods and then transforming with foreign methods. They started with completely indigenous production, and then, through the continuous creation and innovation of the broad masses of workers, they reformed the lifting, ventilation, coal mining, and transportation production links, creating and inventing electric wooden winches, electric wooden fans, and wooden belt conveyors, gradually developing towards semi-mechanization and mechanization along the road from indigenous to foreign.

In January, the number of employees at this mine reached 8,300, and only 2,490 tons of coal were produced, with the cost per ton of coal as high as 72 yuan. By March, the output had increased to 10,000 tons, an increase of more than three times compared to January, the labor force had been reduced to 4,300, a reduction of nearly half, and the financial situation had also turned from loss to profit.

Reform Where the Work is Heavy, Reform Where There Are Many People

The mine Party committee put forward the slogan "Reform where the work is heavy, reform where there are many people," and first determined to take the reform of the labor-intensive mill cart as the central topic of technical innovation. The masses responded to the call of the mine Party committee and proposed a suggestion for trial-producing an electric wooden winch. With the support of the mine Party committee, all the experiments were successfully completed on May 16, shortening the time required for winch lifting from six minutes to one and a half minutes; increasing the amount of coal lifted each time from 200 jin to 600 jin; reducing the number of people using manual mill carts from twelve per shift to one, and greatly reducing the labor intensity.

After a series of reforms in lifting, the underground loading and coal mining could not keep up, becoming a weak link in production. The mine Party committee again mobilized the masses to reform the various production links underground. Manual loading was changed to automatic skip loading; manual drilling was changed to hand-cranked drilling; and manual coal transportation in the roadways was changed to wooden belt conveyor coal transportation. These have all played a great role in reducing labor intensity, improving labor efficiency, and reducing costs.

Grasp Production and Life Simultaneously

With the development of production, the material and cultural life of the workers has gradually improved greatly. When the mine was being built, the workers lived in thatched sheds. Later, the mine Party committee selected workers from the miners who knew how to burn bricks, tiles, and lime, as well as carpenters, and formed a construction team to solve the materials themselves and build houses themselves. At present, they have built more than 420 dormitories, more than 30 shops, and also built a large auditorium that can accommodate 1,500 people. Canteens and bathhouses are also fully equipped. The miners are all satisfied and say, "We truly take the mine as our home and coal as our career. We have everything we need."

Recently, the workers of the Shanjinjia Coal Mine are determined to oppose right-leaning ideas, muster up their energy, and complete and overfulfill the glorious task of producing 100,000 tons of coal this year, and continue to advance along the broad road of "combining foreign and indigenous methods" and "from indigenous to foreign" pointed out by the Party.

    沿着“从土到洋”的大道前进
    ——记安徽省阜阳专区山金家煤矿的成长和发展
    “两条腿走路”的胜利
    “没有两条腿走路，就没有山金家矿”，这句话生动而深刻地说明了安徽省阜阳专区山金家矿成长和发展的过程。
    山金家煤矿是在去年大炼钢铁的群众运动中办起来的。这里原是一个人烟稀少的荒僻山村，当地农民连煤窑是个啥样也不知道。可是，到去年年底，这里已经逐步发展成为年产十万吨的小型煤矿。在这个过程中，他们没有向国家要资金，成为自力更生，白手起家的典范。今年1到9月份，这个矿已给国家生产煤炭六万七千多吨；全员效率提高了四倍多；每吨煤的成本降低了81％；劳动力减少了72％。他们一面生产，一面建设两对洋法生产的小型矿井。其中一对年产五万吨的矿井已于10月份投入生产；一对年产十五万吨的矿井预计在今年12月份建成。
    由土到洋路子宽
    山金家煤矿的成长和发展并不是一帆风顺的。在建矿过程中，他们与形形色色的右倾保守思想展开了坚决的斗争。在对待小型煤矿如何进一步提高和发展的问题上，有两种不同的看法。一种人认为“要开煤矿就要洋机器”，“土法不如洋法先进”；另一种人则认为：“有土就有洋，洋法也是土法来的”，“今天有了土，明天才有洋”，“由土到洋是逐步发展的，而不是一步登天”。山金家煤矿的广大职工认识到：如果采取前一种做法，就只有伸手向国家要投资，要材料，要机器，要技术人员，而国家又不可能一下子就完全解决。毫无疑义，采取这种做法就不能争取时间，赢得高速度，就不能满足国家对煤炭的需要。因而，他们采取了自力更生，先土法上马，后洋法改造的做法，开始完全采用土法生产，然后经过广大职工不断的创造和革新，对提升、通风、采煤、运输各个生产环节进行了改革，创造发明了电动的木制绞车、电动木制扇风机和木制皮带运输机等，沿着由土到洋的道路，逐步向半机械化和机械化的方向发展。
    1月份这个矿的职工人数达八千三百人，仅生产煤炭二千四百九十吨，每吨煤的成本高达七十二元多。到3月份，产量就提高到一万吨，比1月份增长了三倍还多，劳动力减少到四千三百人，减少了近一半，在财务方面也由亏损转为盈利。
    哪里活重改哪里，哪里人多改哪里
    矿党委提出了“哪里活重改哪里，哪里人多改哪里”的口号，首先确定以改革劳动强度很大的磨车为技术革新的中心课题。群众响应矿党委的号召，提出了试制电动木制绞车的建议，在矿党委的支持下，5月16日全部试验成功，使绞车提升一次所需的时间由六分钟缩短到一分半钟；每次的提煤量由二百市斤增加到六百市斤；过去使用人力推磨车每小班要十二个人，现在减少到一个人，并大大减轻了劳动强度。
    在提升方面经过一系列的改革以后，井下的装车、采煤又跟不上去，成为生产中的薄弱环节。矿党委又发动群众对井下的各个生产环节进行改革。把人工装车改为自动箕斗装车；把人工打眼改为手摇钻打眼；把巷道中的人工运煤改为木制皮带运输机运煤。这些都对减轻劳动强度、提高劳动效率、降低成本起了很大的作用。
    既抓生产又抓生活
    随着生产的发展，职工的物质、文化生活也逐步有了很大的改善。在建矿的时候，工人住的是茅草棚，后来，矿党委从矿工中挑选了会烧砖、烧瓦、烧石灰的工人和木匠，组成了建设队，自己解决材料，自己动手修建房屋。目前，他们已修建了四百二十多间宿舍、三十多间商店，还修建了一个能够容纳一千五百人的大礼堂，食堂和澡堂也一应俱全。矿工们都满意地说：“我们真正是以矿为家、以煤为业，要啥有啥了”。
    最近，山金家煤矿的工人决心反透右倾，鼓足干劲，完成和超额完成今年生产煤炭十万吨的光荣任务，继续沿着党所指引的“洋土并举”、“从土到洋”的康庄大道前进。
