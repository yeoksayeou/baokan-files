    Criticizing the Right-Leaning Views in "On Negation"

    The "Journal of Humanities" of Shaanxi Province published three articles in its recently published fifth issue, criticizing Chen Yuanfang's "On Negation" published in the fourth issue of the magazine. These three articles are: Guo Qi's "'On Negation' is the Philosophical Basis of Right-Opportunism," Li Zongyang, Gai Yunfeng, Sun Jiyun, and Wei Zhijun's joint article "Transformation First? Inheritance First?" and Li Linkun's "Defend Revolutionary Dialectics, Oppose Right-Opportunism."

    The authors of the criticism articles pointed out that Chen Yuanfang's "On Negation" article, under the guise of Marxist terminology, distorts the concept of "negation" in dialectics with a right-wing viewpoint, one-sidedly emphasizing inheritance and quantitative change in "negation," castrating the critical and revolutionary essence of materialist dialectics, and insidiously criticizing last year's mass movement.

    Chen Yuanfang equates the affirmative and negative aspects of things, believing that the two are equally important, negating the leading role of change in the development of things. He said: "True dialectical negation is the negation that preserves and inherits all affirmative things. Of course, there is also elimination in negation, but as mentioned above, what is eliminated is only certain aspects of things, not the entire thing." Critics pointed out that dialectical negation is not just the elimination of "certain aspects of things," but the elimination of the basic aspects, the essential aspects, of things. Comrade Guo Qi said, "If in the process of negating old things, what is eliminated is not the essential aspect, but only 'certain aspects,' then what essential difference is there between the new and the old?" Chen Yuanfang also said, "The reason why new things can be formed and consolidated, and the reason why new things are superior to old things, is precisely because they have inherited and further developed everything that is positive and useful in old things. For example, from primitive society to slave society, feudal society, capitalist society, and then to socialist society, each new stage of social development has inherited the positive and useful things of the previous stage of society." These articles refuted this point. Comrade Guo Qi said that the reason why new things are superior to old things, and every new social form is superior to the old social form, is mainly because of the fundamental changes made to the old things. If the new things have not undergone fundamental changes to the old things, then what superiority is there to talk about? Comrade Chen Yuanfang does not mention the qualitative definiteness of the new things themselves, nor does he mention the basic parts of the negated old things. It seems that the superiority of socialist society lies precisely in its inheritance of the good things of capitalism. If this is the case, then inheritance is enough, so what revolution is needed? Quantitative change is enough, why bother with qualitative change?

    Comrade Li Zongyang and others argued in their article, "If 'negation is the unity of change and inheritance,' then in this unity of opposites, change and revolution are the essence and the mainstream, occupying the main aspect of the contradiction; inheritance is only an important factor in the process of negation, a link of connection, without which development will be interrupted." Comrade Li Linkun cited Engels' statement that the revolutionary nature of dialectics is absolute, explaining that understanding all things from the negative and revolutionary aspects is the absolute thing in dialectics, while understanding from the affirmative and conservative aspects is the relative thing in dialectics. Lenin and even Comrade Mao Zedong have strongly emphasized the absoluteness of the struggle of contradictions and the relativity of unity, which are all related to the anti-opportunistic struggle tasks of a certain period. Chen Yuanfang's promotion of erroneous views in his "On Negation" article is actually providing a "theoretical basis" for right-opportunism. Comrade Guo Qi said in the concluding part of his article: "Comrade Chen Yuanfang's 'On Negation' uses the method of metaphysical eclecticism, using the guise of 'two-point theory' to equate the main and secondary aspects of things, saying that there is inheritance in negation, that we must oppose both nihilism and restorationism, and that we must oppose understanding negation from both the 'left' and the right. In fact, under the guise of talking about both change and inheritance, he intentionally emphasizes inheritance and eliminates change; under the guise of talking about both quantitative change and qualitative change, he emphasizes quantitative change and eliminates qualitative change; under the guise of opposing both 'left' and right tendencies, he opposes the non-existent 'left' opportunism, thereby spreading his right-opportunism. ... Comrade Chen Yuanfang uses this method of eclecticism to promote his politically right-opportunistic views."

### 批判“论否定”一文的右倾观点

    批判“论否定”一文的右倾观点
    陕西省“人文杂志”在最近出版的第五期上，发表了三篇文章，批判这个杂志第四期上发表的陈元方的“论否定”一文。这三篇文章是：郭琦的“‘论否定’是右倾机会主义的哲学基础”，李宗阳、盖运丰、孙集云、魏治均合写的“变革第一？继承第一？”李林昆的“保卫革命辩证法，反对右倾机会主义”。
    批判文章的作者指出，陈元方同志的“论否定”一文，是在马克思主义词句的掩盖下，以右的观点来曲解辩证法的“否定”概念，片面强调“否定”中的继承和量变，阉割了唯物辩证法的批判的革命的本质，并且含沙射影地非难去年的群众运动。
    陈元方把事物的肯定一面和否定一面平列起来，认为两者是一个半斤，一个八两，否定了变革在事物发展中所起的主导作用。他说：“真正的辩证法的否定，是保持和继承一切肯定的东西的否定。当然，否定中也有消灭，但是如上所述，消灭的只是事物的某些方面，而不是整个事物。”批判者指出：辩证法的否定，并不只是消灭“事物的某些方面”，而是消灭事物的基本方面，本质方面。郭琦同志说，“如果在否定旧事物的过程中，所消灭的不是本质方面，而只是‘某些方面’，那么，新与旧还有什么本质的差别呢？”陈元方还说，“新事物之所以能够形成和巩固起来，新事物之所以比旧事物优越，正是由于它继承了并且进一步发展了旧事物中一切有积极意义的东西。例如，由原始社会到奴隶社会、封建社会、资本主义社会再到社会主义社会，每一个新的社会发展阶段，都是继承了前一社会阶段的积极有用的东西。”对于这一点，这几篇文章作了批驳。郭琦同志说，新事物比旧事物优越，每一个新的社会形态比旧的社会形态优越，主要的是对旧事物进行了根本的变革，如果新的事物对旧的事物没有根本变革，那还谈得上什么优越性呢？陈元方同志对新事物本身的质的规定性只字不提，对被否定了的旧事物的基本部分也只字不提，好像社会主义社会所以优越，正是它继承了资本主义的好东西，如此说来，继承就够了，还革什么命呢？量变就够了，何必质变呢？
    李宗阳等同志的文章论述说，“如果说‘否定是变革和继承的统一’，那么在这种对立的统一中，变革、革命是本质、主流，居于矛盾的主要方面；继承只是否定过程的一个重要因素，是联系的环节，没有它发展就会中断。”李林昆同志引证了恩格斯的关于辩证法的革命性质是绝对的话，说明：对一切事物从否定方面、革命方面去理解，是辩证法中的绝对的东西，而从肯定的方面、保守的方面去理解，是辩证法中相对的东西。列宁以至毛泽东同志都曾经十分强调矛盾斗争的绝对性，统一的相对性，这都是和一定时期的反机会主义斗争任务相联系的。陈元方在“论否定”一文中宣传错误观点，实际上是为右倾机会主义作“理论根据”的。郭琦同志在他的文章结尾部分说：“陈元方同志的‘论否定’一文，用的是形而上学折衷主义方法，打着，‘两点论’的幌子，把事物的主要方面与次要方面平列起来，说在否定中有继承，既要反对虚无主义，又要反对复古主义，既反对从‘左’的方面理解否定，又反对从右的方面理解否定。实际上，是在既谈变革又谈继承的幌子下有意强调继承而取消变革；在既谈量变又谈质变的幌子下强调量变而取消质变；在既反对‘左’倾又反对右倾的幌子下来反对并不存在的‘左’倾机会主义，从而散布他的右倾机会主义。……陈元方同志就是用这种折衷主义的方法，来宣扬他的政治上的右倾机会主义观点。”
