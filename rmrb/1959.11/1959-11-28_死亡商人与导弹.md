	Merchants of Death and Missiles
	Le Shan
	As early as the 1930s, when the U.S. Senate Munitions Investigating Committee, headed by Senator Gerald Nye, called American arms merchants merchants of death, and published sensational reports about how American arms merchants, bankers, and politicians colluded to seize staggering profits, the annual U.S. military expenditure was only about 700 million U.S. dollars, accounting for about 10% of the total budget expenditure. Now, the annual U.S. military expenditure exceeds 40 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for about 60% of the total budget expenditure.
	Since 1957, the focus of the U.S. arms expansion and war preparation has gradually shifted to the development of new weapons such as missiles. The expenses spent on trial production and production of various missiles are very large, reaching as much as 3.4 billion U.S. dollars annually.
	The U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force are making every effort to develop new weapons such as missiles. The main missile of the U.S. Air Force, the "Bomarc" missile, has been researched and trial-produced for many years, spending 1.8 billion U.S. dollars, in an effort to put it into mass production by 1961. The Army's "Nike-Zeus" missile, the so-called anti-missile missile, is currently in the experimental stage and is expected to be manufactured within a year or two, with planned costs reaching a staggering 7 billion U.S. dollars. As for the Navy's trial production of the "Polaris" missile, no expense is spared. According to the "Wall Street Journal", a submarine fleet including thirty submarines equipped with "Polaris" missiles would cost about 3 billion U.S. dollars, while "Fortune" magazine estimates it to be 7 billion U.S. dollars. As everyone knows, the United States spent only about 2 billion U.S. dollars on research and trial production of atomic bombs over four years.
	American merchants of death have made excessive profits from missile production. More than a dozen large companies engaged in missile production, including "General Dynamics Corporation", "Boeing Aircraft Company", "North American Aviation", and "United Aircraft Corporation", etc., made a total net profit of 156 million U.S. dollars in 1956, four times more than the profits made during the Korean War in 1951. In 1957, when the U.S. economy began to deteriorate, the profits of "General Dynamics Corporation", "Boeing Aircraft Company", "North American Aviation", and "United Aircraft Corporation" not only did not decrease, but increased by more than 20%. In 1958, these companies continued to make huge profits from military orders.
	American big consortiums are frantically competing in the manufacturing of missiles. Not long ago, when the U.S. Congress was debating the future of the Air Force's "Bomarc" missile, the "Boeing Aircraft Company", which was testing the "Bomarc" missile, advertised extensively, boasting that many cities would gain economic benefits from the manufacture of the "Bomarc" missile. The big company bosses, blinded by arms profits, do not care about the threat to people's safety caused by arms expansion and war preparation.
	Not only missile production can make military enterprises rich, but also ground equipment related to missiles has become a way to make money. The production cost of missiles is about one-ninth of the cost of ground equipment, so ground equipment is more profitable than missile production. The ground support system, launch pads, and other installations at Cape Canaveral, the famous U.S. missile launch base, cost 300 million U.S. dollars in construction contracts alone. An Air Force "Atlas" intercontinental missile squadron, including sixty missiles, is estimated to cost 100 million U.S. dollars, while the ground equipment will cost 900 million U.S. dollars.
	Despite repeated failures of missile launches, American merchants of death can still benefit, because every failure of missile launches means an invisible increase in military orders. Joseph Walker Company, which manufactures missiles, said that although the cost of an intercontinental missile is 2 million U.S. dollars, and the estimated cost of an intercontinental bomber is 8 million U.S. dollars, a missile can only be launched once. Therefore, trial production of intercontinental missiles is more beneficial than manufacturing intercontinental bombers.
	The competition among American big companies for missile orders is reflected in the Pentagon. Disputes between the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force over missile production are endless. The dispute between the Air Force's "Matador" missile and the Navy's "Regulus" missile, and the dispute between the Air Force's "Thor" missile and the Army's "Jupiter" missile, have always been tense and noisy.
	The Morgan, Rockefeller, Mellon and other consortiums are all showing their abilities to support and place their agents in the government to grab missile orders.
	McCloskey, a banker of the Rockefeller consortium and the main representative of Rockefeller on the board of directors of American Telecommunications Company, is the main representative of the Rockefeller consortium in its efforts to win missile orders. McCloskey is the chairman of Manhattan Chase Bank, which provides funds to many missile companies and has a capital of 7 billion U.S. dollars.
	The strength of the Morgan consortium in the missile order competition is also considerable. U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy was formerly a director of General Electric Company and Chrysler Corporation, which are controlled by the Morgan consortium. Joseph Dodge, an advisor to the White House, is also a director of Chrysler Corporation and a close friend of McElroy. Chrysler Corporation produces the "Jupiter" and "Redstone" missiles.
	Douglas Aircraft Company, which manufactures the "Thor" missile, has close ties with the Giannini consortium in California. Therefore, the so-called dispute between the Air Force's "Thor" missile and the Army's "Jupiter" missile is, in fact, a dispute between the Giannini consortium and the Morgan consortium.
	Due to fierce competition and evenly matched strength, a peculiar phenomenon has emerged in U.S. missile production. Often, one missile is contracted by more than a dozen competing companies. According to the American "Worker's Weekly", the first-stage fuel of the Navy's intercontinental ballistic missile "Vanguard" is manufactured by General Electric Company, the second stage is manufactured by General Tire and Rubber Company, the third stage is manufactured by Grand Central Rocket Company, and the "Vanguard" rocket itself is manufactured by Hercules Powder Company. As for the gyroscope, it may be manufactured by Sperry Gyroscope Company, the electrical sequencer is manufactured by another company, and the ground support system is manufactured by yet another company.
	No matter how fiercely the American merchants of death compete in the scramble for missile orders, they are all planning to make another fortune from new war disasters and attempt to dominate the world.

    死亡商人与导弹
    乐山
    早在三十年代，当以参议员吉拉尔德·奈为首的美国参议院军火调查委员会，把美国军火商人称为死亡商人，发表哄动一时的关于美国军火商人与银行家、政客狼狈为奸、攫取了惊人利润的情况报告的时候，美国每年的军费还大约只有七亿美元左右，约占预算支出总额的10％。现在，美国每年军费超过了四百亿，约占预算支出总额的60％。
    自从1957年以来，美国扩军备战的重点即逐渐移向发展导弹等新武器，花在试制和生产各种导弹上面的费用非常庞大，以年达三十四亿美元之巨。
    美国海陆空三军竭力发展导弹等新武器，美国空军的主要导弹“鲍马克”式导弹，已经研究、试制了好多年，用了十八亿美元，力图到1961年成批生产。陆军“奈克—宙斯”式导弹，是所谓反导弹导弹，目前正在试验阶段，准备在一两年时间内制成，计划费用竟高达七十亿美元的惊人数字。至于海军试制“北极星”式导弹，更是不惜工本。据“华尔街日报”估计，一支包括三十艘装配着“北极星”式导弹的潜水艇队，约需三十亿美元，而“幸福”杂志的估计则为七十亿美元。大家知道，美国研究、试制原子弹，历时四年，也只不过花了二十亿美元左右。
    美国死亡商人从导弹生产中获得了超额的利润。从事导弹生产的十多家大公司，其中包括“通用动力公司”、“波音飞机公司”、“北美航空公司”、“联合飞机公司”等等，在1956年共获纯利一亿五千六百万美元，比1951年朝鲜战争时期所取得的利润增加四倍。1957年，在美国经济开始恶化的情况下，“通用动力公司”、“波音飞机公司”、“北美航空公司”、“联合飞机公司”的利润不但没有减少，反而增加了20％以上。1958年这些公司继续从军事订货中获取了巨额的利润。
    美国大财阀们在制造导弹的竞争中，狂热到了极点。不久以前，当美国国会正就空军“鲍马克”式导弹前途进行辩论时，试制“鲍马克”式导弹的“波音飞机公司”大登广告，吹嘘由于“鲍马克”式导弹的制造，许多城市将要获得经济上的好处。被军火利润迷了心窍的大公司老板，对于扩军备战对人民安全造成的威胁，是不在眼中的。
    不仅在导弹生产方面，能使军火企业发财致富，与导弹相联系的地面设备，也成了生财大道。导弹的生产费用与地面设备费用约成一与九之比，因此地面设备比导弹生产更赚钱。美国著名的导弹发射基地卡纳维拉尔角的地面支持系统、发射台和其他装置，单在建筑合同方面就花费了三亿美元。空军“阿特拉斯”洲际导弹一个中队包括六十枚导弹，估计成本将达一亿美元，而地面设备则将达九亿美元。
    尽管导弹发射一再失败，美国死亡商人还是可以得到好处，因为导弹发射的每一次失败，意味着军事订货的无形增加。制造导弹的约瑟夫·沃克公司说，虽然一枚洲际导弹的成本为两百万美元，而洲际轰炸机的估计成本为八百万美元，但是导弹只能发射一次。因此，试制洲际导弹反比制造洲际轰炸机更有好处。
    美国大公司争夺导弹定货的角逐，反映到了五角大楼。美国陆军、海军和空军因导弹生产问题而发生的纠纷层出不穷。空军的“斗牛士”式导弹与海军的“雷古鲁斯”式导弹之争、空军的“雷神”式导弹与陆军的“丘辟特”式导弹之争，一直剑拔弩张，吵闹不休。
    摩根、洛克菲勒、梅隆等财团都各显神通，扶植和安置它们在政府中的代理人，抢夺导弹订货。
    洛克菲勒财团的银行家、洛克菲勒在美国电讯公司董事会中的主要代表麦克洛伊，是洛克菲勒财团争取导弹订货的主要代表。麦克洛伊是向许多导弹公司提供经费的、拥有七十亿美元资本的曼哈顿大通银行的董事长。
    摩根财团在导弹订货争夺战中的实力也是很可观的。美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊从前是摩根财团控制的通用电气公司和克莱斯勒公司的董事。白宫的一位顾问约瑟夫·道奇，也是克莱斯勒公司的董事，并且是麦克耳罗伊的亲密朋友。克莱斯勒公司生产“丘辟特”式和“红石”式导弹。
    制造“雷神”式导弹的道格拉斯飞机公司，同加利福尼亚州的基安尼尼财团有密切的关系，因此所谓空军的“雷神”式导弹与陆军的“丘辟特”式导弹之争，事实上就是基安尼尼财团同摩根财团之争。
    由于竞争剧烈，势均力敌，在美国导弹生产中出现了一个奇特的现象，往往一枚导弹却由十几家竞争的公司来承造。据美国“工人周报”报道：海军的洲际弹道导弹“先锋号”的第一级燃料由通用电气公司制造的，第二级由通用轮胎橡胶公司制造，第三级由大中央火箭公司制造，而“先锋号”火箭本身由赫古勒斯火药公司制造，至于回旋器可能是由斯佩里回旋器公司制造的，电气替续器又由另一家公司制造，地面支持体系则由别一家公司制造。
    不管美国死亡商人在争夺导弹订货方面竞争如何剧烈，他们都在打算从新的战争灾难中再发一次横财，并妄图独霸世界。
