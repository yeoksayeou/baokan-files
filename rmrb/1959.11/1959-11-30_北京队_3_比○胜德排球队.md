Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The German Democratic Republic men's volleyball team played a friendly match against the Beijing volleyball team tonight. The Beijing team won three to zero. The scores for the three sets were 16-14, 15-11, and 15-5.

    The visiting team played excellently in the first and second sets, with fierce spikes and tight blocking, maintaining an advantage for most of the time. The Beijing team played flexibly and turned defeat into victory. The first set progressed quickly. The Beijing team scored two points in a row at the start, but due to disorganized play, the visiting team took the opportunity to score consecutive points with dinks, spikes, and serves, forming a score of 6-2 in less than five minutes. The visiting team then extended the score to 8-2. The Beijing team fought bravely to catch up, using clever dinks and inducing the opponent to miss blocks, gradually bringing the score closer to the opponent, tying at 12-12 and 14-14. After that, there was a fierce competition on the court, with the serve changing hands four times. Finally, the Beijing team scored two points in a row to end the first set.

    In the second set, the same situation as in the first set occurred. The visiting team's offensive was fierce, leading by as many as seven points at one point with a score of 8-1. After the Beijing team caught up to 11-11, the visiting team held the ball, and the athlete crossed the line, violating the rules. Failure to pay attention to protecting the block resulted in the loss of four consecutive points, losing the second set.

    第二局中，又出现了第一局中的局面，客队攻势凌厉，一度以八比一领先七分之多。北京队追到十一平后，客队持球，运动员过线犯规，封网未注意保护连失四分，输去第二局。
