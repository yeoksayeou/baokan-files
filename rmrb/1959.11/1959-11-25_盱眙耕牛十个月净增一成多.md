Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing. Xuyi County, Jiangsu Province, had bred 4,058 calves by the end of October this year. Adding these to the original number of cultivated cattle, the total reached 29,608, a net increase of 16% compared to the number kept at the end of 1958. In 1950, each head of cultivated cattle in the county was responsible for 116 mu of farmland; this has now been reduced to 40 mu. Currently, the cattle are in very good condition, with 70% being in full prime condition, 24.8% at 90% prime, and 5.2% at 80% prime.

The rapid development of cultivated cattle in Xuyi County has brought about significant changes in the county's agricultural production. Before 1956, some people still had to pull plows during the summer harvest, summer planting, autumn harvest, and autumn planting seasons. Now, not only has the phenomenon of people pulling plows been eliminated, but also more than 4,000 head of cattle have been drawn out for transportation. This year, the autumn planting of 540,000 mu of land was completed two solar terms earlier than in previous years. The amount of manure accumulated by the county's draft animals was more than 280,000 dan in 1950, and this year it reached 840,000 dan. The quality of cultivation has improved, with the depth of plowing and harrowing increasing from two inches in 1950 to four and a half inches, and the number of plowing and harrowing passes increasing from one to three or four. Due to the development of draft animals and other factors, the county's agricultural output has increased rapidly. In 1958, the county's total grain output increased by more than 30% compared to 1957, and this year, despite a hundred days without rain, a bumper harvest was still achieved. In addition, the county sold a total of 4,157 head of cattle this year, increasing income by more than 2 million yuan.

Currently, Xuyi County is focusing on the overwintering and winter mating of cultivated cattle, and has mobilized more than 20,000 people to go up the mountains and down to the water to collect green storage feed. (Attached picture)

    盱眙耕牛十个月净增一成多
    据新华社南京讯　江苏盱眙县今年到10月底止，已繁殖小牛四千零五十八头，加上原有耕牛，共有二万九千六百零八头，比1958年底圈存数净增16％。这个县在1950年时每头耕牛负担一百一十六亩耕地，现在已降低到四十亩。目前，耕牛膘度很好，满膘的达70％，九成膘的达24.8％，八成膘的5.2％。
    盱眙县耕牛的迅速发展，使全县农业生产起了显著变化。1956年以前，夏收夏种秋收秋种还要用一部分人拉犁，现在不仅已消灭了人拉犁的现象，而且还抽出四千多头耕牛从事运输，今年五十四万亩秋种田比往年提早两个节令结束了播种任务。全县耕畜积肥量，1950年是二十八万多担，今年达到八十四万担。耕作质量提高了，农田耕耖深度由1950年的二寸提高到四寸半，耕耖次数由一次提高到三、四次。由于耕畜的发展和其他原因，全县农业增产很快。1958年全县粮食总产量比1957年增长30％强，今年百日无雨，仍然获得了大丰收。此外，全县今年共出卖耕牛四千一百五十七头，增加收入二百多万元。
    目前，盱眙县正在大抓耕牛过冬和冬配工作，已发动两万多人上山下水，采集青贮饲料。（附图片）
