Utilizing Both Indigenous and Foreign Methods, Combining Large and Small Scales for Processing and Production
Zhong County's Wild Plants Transformed into Treasures

Chengdu, November 29th (Reported by this newspaper) – Following the mobilization of 400,000 people in a concentrated small autumn harvest campaign in October, Zhong County's commercial departments, beginning in November, while vigorously grasping the procurement and processing of agricultural products centered on oil-bearing crops, further launched a mass movement to collect, purchase, and utilize wild plant materials. In just half a month, in addition to the continued over-fulfillment of the annual plan for major products such as tung seeds, peanuts, sesame, cotton, ramie, and tea, they also purchased 37 million jin of wild plant materials, equivalent to 50.68% of the previous ten months. The total annual purchase reached over 110 million jin, more than eight times the annual plan, and an increase of 12.64 times compared to last year's actual performance. More than 900 kinds of wild plants were processed and utilized, and over 800 kinds of new products such as oil, sugar, wine, soap, fiber products, and tannin extract were trial-produced and produced on a large scale, generating an additional cash income of 7.7 million yuan for the communes and members, an average of 51.3 yuan per household and 27.5 yuan per labor force. This has supported the development of industrial and agricultural production and increased the supply of market goods.

In order to fully utilize the collected wild plant materials, the Zhong County Party Committee decided to launch a mass processing campaign. The county's commercial departments and people's communes cooperated closely, adopting a series of "walking on two legs" methods, based on the principles of utilizing both indigenous and foreign methods, starting from small scales and progressing to large scales, and starting from low levels and progressing to high levels, combining centralized processing with organized commune processing. For products that are technically complex and require certain processing equipment, such as tannin extract, papermaking, winemaking, alcohol production, and rayon, the commercial departments independently and jointly operated factories and workshops with the communes. For products that are relatively simple to process and the technology is easy to master, such as starch, fiber, pesticides, feed, pulp, and straw mat weaving, the commercial departments assisted the commune management districts and production teams in running comprehensive processing factories and workshops, as well as processing groups. On the basis of the original processing factories and workshops, the county actively expanded and built a large number of processing factories and workshops by adopting the methods of "merging, expanding, increasing, and transforming." In Ruxi District, 403 new factories and workshops were built in four days. Huangjin Commune has successively expanded, newly built, and restored a total of 157 papermills, feed mills, soap factories, pesticide factories, comprehensive processing factories, oil pressing factories, wineries, and starch factories. According to incomplete statistics, the county currently has 2,097 factories and workshops in operation.

In order to meet the technical needs of large-scale processing and utilization, Zhong County established a technical research group headed by the County Governor. Districts and communes also established corresponding organizations to strengthen technical guidance at all levels and organize the exchange of technical experience. At present, the county is vigorously training technical backbones, with 87 people drawn from various district communes to study fiber processing and the technology of using Imperata cylindrica to make straw mats at the Qijiahe Fiber Factory and Chengguan Straw Mat Factory. At the same time, all processing factories mobilized the vast number of employees to engage in technical innovation, continuously improving quality and reducing costs. For example, in the straw mat factory, everyone contributed ideas and suggestions, quickly grasped the properties of Imperata cylindrica, and the number of straw mats produced per machine per day increased by 25%. The Qijiahe Fiber Factory mobilized employees to create fiber beating machines and washing machines, increasing work efficiency by one to ten times.

Over the past ten months, the county has successively sent 47 people to other places to learn technology, held a total of 27 technical training classes and on-site technical exchange meetings, and trained 724 various technical personnel, laying a technical foundation for large-scale processing and utilization of wild plant materials.

    土洋并举大小结合加工生产
    忠县野生植物变百宝
    本报成都29日电　忠县商业部门在10月份发动四十万人大搞小秋收突击运动后，11月份开始，在猛抓以油料为中心的农产品采购加工工作的同时，进一步展开了野生植物原料采摘收购和加工利用的群众运动。在短短的半月中，除已完成年度计划的大宗产品桐籽、花生、芝麻、棉花、苎麻、茶叶等继续超额收购到外，又收购了野生植物原料三千七百万斤，相当于前十个月的50.68％。全年累计收购了一亿一千多万斤，达到年计划的八倍多，比去年实绩增加十二点六四倍。加工利用了野生植物九百余种，试制和生产出油、糖、酒、肥皂、纤维成品、栲胶等八百余种新产品，并已大批生产，共为公社和社员增加现金收入七百七十万元，平均每户收入五十一元三角，每个劳力收入二十七元五角。这就支持了工农业生产的发展，增加了市场供应物资。
    为了充分利用已采集到的野生植物原料，忠县县委决定开展群众性的加工运动。全县商业部门和人民公社密切协作，根据土洋并举、由小到大、由低到高的方针，采取集中加工和组织公社加工相结合的一系列“两条腿走路”的办法。对技术比较复杂、要求具备一定加工设备的产品，如栲胶、造纸、酿酒、制酒精、人造棉等，由商业部门自办和与公社合办厂坊加工。对加工比较简单、技术容易掌握的产品，如淀粉、纤维、农药、饲料、纸浆、编草席等，则由商业部门协助公社管理区队和生产队办综合性的加工厂坊及加工小组生产。全县在原有加工厂坊的基础上，采取“并、扩、增、转”的办法，积极扩建和新建了大批加工厂坊。汝溪区四天中就新建厂坊四百零三个。黄金公社先后扩建新建和恢复造纸厂、饲料厂、肥皂厂、农药厂、综合加工厂、油榨厂、酿酒厂、淀粉厂等共一百五十七个。据不完全统计，全县目前已投入生产的厂坊达二千零九十七个。
    为了适应大搞加工利用的技术需要，忠县成立了技术研究小组，由县长亲自挂帅；区和公社也建立相应组织，层层加强技术指导，组织交流技术经验。现在，全县还在大力培训技术骨干，由各区公社共抽调八十七人分别到戚家河纤维厂、城关草席厂学习纤维加工、利用丝茅草打草席等技术经验。各加工厂同时发动广大职工大闹技术革新，不断提高质量，降低成本。如草席厂人人献计、个个献策，很快摸索到丝茅草的性能，每个机子日产草席数量提高25％。戚家河纤维厂发动职工创造了纤维捶打机和洗料机，提高工效一至十倍。
    十个多月来，全县先后派往外地学习技术的四十七人，举办技术训练班、技术交流现场会共二十七次，培训了各种技术人员七百二十四名，为大搞野生植物原料加工利用打下了技术基础。
