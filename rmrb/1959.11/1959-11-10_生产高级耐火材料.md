    Producing Advanced Refractory Materials
    The Changxing Refractory Material Factory in Zhejiang, established by several demobilized soldiers in a dilapidated temple, has, after four years of hard work, now become capable of producing a variety of advanced refractory materials.
    In the past year or so, they have successfully trial-produced more than twenty new products. The refractoriness of these new products has been increased from 1600 degrees to 1700 degrees, and the finished product rate has reached 93%.

    几个复员军人在一座破庙里建立起来的浙江长兴耐火器材厂，经过四年努力，现在已经能够生产多种高级耐火器材。
    一年多来，他们试制成功的新产品有二十多种。这些新产品的耐火度已由一千六百度提高到一千七百度，成品率达到93％。
