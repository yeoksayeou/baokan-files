Belgian Colonial Rule in Turmoil
	Lian Fa
The Congolese people have once again launched a struggle against colonial rule. This is a continuation and development of the Congolese people's anti-colonial struggle in January of this year. In April, several parties, led by the Congolese National Movement Party, held a meeting in Luluabourg, clearly putting forward the struggle goal of establishing a Congolese government in 1961. This shows that the Congolese people's struggle for independence and freedom has entered a new stage, and Belgian colonial rule is further shaking.
	In order to maintain its colonial rule over the Congo, the Belgian authorities have carried out bloody military suppression this year, and thousands of Congolese people have shed blood for the cause of Congolese independence. Nineteen large-scale "detention camps" are also full of Congolese patriotic fighters. At the same time, the colonial authorities have also carried out various political deceptions and political division schemes, proposing so-called Congolese "independence" plans, holding hypocritical elections, etc., vainly attempting to disguise colonial rule and continue to maintain the exploitation and rule over the Congolese people. However, the Congolese people answered it with: boycotting the "elections" and demanding immediate independence.
	The struggle of the Congolese people has severely hit Belgium's colonial plunder activities in the Congo. More than 500 large and small companies of the Belgian monopoly capital group extract huge profits of 10 billion francs from the Congo every year, which is equivalent to more than 20% of the Congo's total national income. Now, Belgium's economic position in the Congo has become unsustainable. In June of this year, the stock prices of Congolese companies had already fallen by 9.2%. The Congo's treasury reserves have also decreased sharply. Private investment by Belgian monopoly capital in the Congo has tended to stagnate, and the phenomenon of capital outflow has become increasingly serious.
	The development of the situation in the Congo has expanded the contradictions within the Belgian ruling group. In the past year or so, the Belgian cabinet has successively replaced three ministers for Congo and Ruanda-Urundi affairs. The Belgian Socialist Party seized the opportunity to carry out a no-confidence vote. The internal contradictions of the ruling party have also become increasingly acute. The Belgian government was forced to agree to convene parliament on November 3 to debate the Congo issue in advance. The amplitude of the turbulent Belgian domestic political situation is becoming larger and larger, changing the relatively stable situation of the Belgian political situation.
	In order to overcome their current predicament, the Belgian ruling authorities are asking other imperialist countries, mainly the United States, for "assistance."
	In May of this year, when the King of Belgium visited the United States, he consulted with the United States on the issue of investment in the Congo and asked for the support of the United States. On September 17, the Belgian Minister of Finance visited the United States and made a request to the United States for a loan of 8.1 billion Belgian francs (approximately 160 million US dollars). According to the "Free Belgian Daily" on October 2, Belgium and the United States are negotiating a loan of 100 million US dollars. At the same time, the Belgian authorities are also requesting financial support from other imperialist countries. On October 12, at the "Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Six Small European Countries," Belgium agreed to the decision to establish a so-called "Special Committee to Aid Backward Countries" and agreed to allow the forces of the "Common Market" to penetrate deep into the Congo.
	The United States already has huge investments in the Congo and also enjoys 90% of the mining rights of Congo's uranium mines. Therefore, it has always supported Belgium's suppression of the Congolese national independence movement and has continuously expanded its own colonial interests from it. Recently, it has more actively used the turmoil of Belgian colonial rule to further expand its power in the Congo. At the beginning of this year, the US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Satterthwaite, blatantly expressed this two-faced attitude. He verbally and hypocritically expressed "sympathy" for the reasonable aspirations of Africans, but hoped that the Congo could achieve "independence" in "peaceful circumstances." This spring, when the American monopoly capitalist Rockefeller visited the Congo, he also publicly declared that investment was to "take risks," without concealing his ambition to further invade the Congo.
	These situations have long aroused resentment among some people within the Belgian ruling group. Recently, when the Belgian Minister of Finance visited the United States to discuss loans, many Belgian bourgeois newspapers expressed unease about the further intrusion of American forces into the Congo. They advocated that the US loan should only be used as a loan to the Belgian government, and not as a loan to the Central Bank of the Congo, in order to resist the US directly interfering in Congolese affairs through loans.
	With the rapid development and deepening of the Congolese national revolutionary forces, the Belgian ruling group has been deeply mired in a quagmire from which it cannot extricate itself. No matter how the Belgian ruling group struggles in every possible way, and no matter how the United States supports it, it is impossible to change this situation. The Congolese people who have suffered oppression and exploitation will ultimately determine the future and destiny of the Congo. This great day is not far away.

    比利时的殖民统治在动摇中
    连发
    刚果人民又一次掀起了反殖民统治的斗争。这是今年1月刚果人民反殖民统治斗争的继续和发展。4月间，以刚果民族运动党为首的几个政党在路路阿堡举行会议，明确提出要求在1961年成立刚果人政府的斗争目标。这说明刚果人民争取独立自由的斗争已进入了新的阶段，比利时殖民统治在进一步动摇中。
    比利时当局为了维持对刚果的殖民统治，今年以来曾经进行血腥的军事镇压，数以千计的刚果人民为刚果独立事业流下了鲜血。十九个巨大规模的“拘留营”里也关满了刚果的爱国战士。与此同时，殖民当局又进行种种政治欺骗和政治分化阴谋，提出所谓刚果“独立”方案，举行虚伪选举等等，妄想把殖民统治伪装起来，而继续维持对刚果人民的剥削和统治。但是，刚果人民回答它的是：抵制“选举”，要求立即独立。
    刚果人民的斗争严重打击了比利时对刚果的殖民掠夺活动。比利时垄断资本集团的大小五百余家公司每年在刚果榨取一百亿法郎的巨额利润，这相当于刚果全部国民收入的20％以上。现在，比利时在刚果的经济阵地已经出现了难以维持的局面。今年6月份，刚果各公司的股票价格已经跌落了9.2％。刚果国库储备也急剧减少。比利时垄断资本对刚果的私人投资趋于停顿，资金外流现象也日益严重。
    刚果形势的发展扩大了比利时统治集团内部的矛盾。一年多来，比利时内阁已先后更换了三个刚果和卢安达—乌隆迪事务大臣。比利时社会党乘机进行倒阁活动。执政党内部矛盾也日趋尖锐。比利时政府被迫同意提前在11月3日召开议会辩论刚果问题。比利时国内政治局势动荡幅度正在越来越大，改变了比利时政局相对稳定的局面。
    比利时统治当局为了度过它们目前所处的困境，正在要求其他帝国主义国家主要是美国的“援助”。
    今年5月，比利时国王访问美国时，曾就刚果投资问题和美国进行磋商，要求美国支持。9月17日，比利时财政大臣访美，又向美国提出贷款八十一亿比利时法郎的要求（约合一亿六千多万美元）。据10月2日的“自由比利时报”透露，比美正在商谈一亿美元的贷款。与此同时，比利时当局也要求其他帝国主义国家的财政支持。10月12日，在“小欧洲六国外交部长会议”上，比利时赞成建立所谓“援助落后国家特别委员会”的决定，同意“共同市场”势力深入刚果。
    美国在刚果早已有了巨额投资，同时又享有刚果铀矿的90％的开采权，因此，它一直支持比利时对刚果民族独立运动的镇压，并从中不断扩大自己的殖民利益，最近更积极地利用比利时殖民统治的动摇，进一步在刚果扩大势力。今年年初，美国负责非洲问题的助理国务卿萨脱斯威特就曾露骨地表示了这种两面态度。他口头上虚伪地表示“同情”非洲人的合理愿望，但又希望刚果能在“和平的情况下”取得“独立”。今年春天，美国大垄断资本家洛克菲勒访问刚果时，也公然宣称投资就是要“冒险”，毫不掩饰进一步侵略刚果的野心。
    这些情况早已引起比利时统治集团内部某些人士的反感。最近比利时财政大臣访美商谈贷款时，比利时许多资产阶级报刊都对美国势力进一步侵入刚果表示不安。它们主张美国的贷款只能作为对比利时政府的贷款，而不能作为对刚果中央银行的贷款，以抵御美国通过贷款直接过问刚果事务。
    随着刚果民族革命力量的迅速发展和斗争的深入，比利时统治集团已经深深地陷入不能自拔的泥沼之中。不管比利时统治集团怎样百般挣扎，美国又怎样加以支持，都没有可能改变这一形势。饱受压迫和剥削的刚果人民将最后决定刚果的前途和命运。这个伟大的日子已经不会很远了。
