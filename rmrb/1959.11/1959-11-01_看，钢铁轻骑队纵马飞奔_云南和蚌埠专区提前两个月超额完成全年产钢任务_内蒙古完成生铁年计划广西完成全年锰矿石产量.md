Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 30th. Yunnan Province's iron and steel industry workers, after completing the annual iron production plan three months ahead of schedule, overfulfilled the annual steel production target by 2.38% on October 27th. By the 27th, the province's steel output had reached 2.4 times the total output of the previous year, the steel qualification rate had greatly improved compared to the previous year, and costs had been greatly reduced.

The outstanding achievement of Yunnan Province's iron and steel industry front in completing the annual plan ahead of schedule is another proof of the infinite power of the General Line.

After the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was issued, the workers on the iron and steel industry front in the province were even more high-spirited, launching a magnificent mass movement against Right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and practicing increasing production and practicing economy. The province's steel output rose linearly, increasing by 28.5% in August compared to July, 32.5% in September compared to August, and an estimated 32% in October compared to September; the steel qualification rate rose to 86.7% in July and further to 91.5% in September.

Currently, the workers on the iron and steel industry front in Yunnan Province are riding the waves, continuing to oppose Right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and deepen the movement to increase production and practice economy, striving to produce more steel in the last two months of this year, and working together with the steel front workers across the country to strive to overfulfill the task of twelve million tons of steel.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, Anhui, 28th. Steelmaking and rolling workers in Bengbu Special District, Anhui Province, completed the annual steel and rolled steel production plan ahead of schedule on the 28th, reporting the victory to the National Conference of Heroes.

Bengbu Special District has built eleven 1.5- to 3-ton steelmaking converters and three 150 and 250 mm rolling mills this year. Since the construction of these facilities, the steelmaking and rolling workers have been studying diligently and striving to master the technology, so that the output and quality of steel and rolled steel have been continuously increasing. The output in August tripled compared to July, and the average daily output in October increased by 66% compared to September. The workers of the 1.5-ton converter at Bengbu Steel Plant improved the batching method of the converter lining, increasing the furnace life from ten heats to more than thirty heats.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 31st. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has completed the annual pig iron production plan 76 days ahead of schedule, exceeding it by 9.1%. The pig iron qualification rate has reached 85%-99%, the cost of ironmaking has gradually decreased, and the production of ore, refractory materials, coke, etc., surrounding ironmaking has also overfulfilled the annual plan.

The people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, who had never produced pig iron before, have established many iron and steel bases on the basis of "small-scale local groups" since last year, and have continuously improved their production technology. The workers of Hohhot Steel Plant, Baotou Steel Plant, and other enterprises have carried out a production increase and economy practice movement this year with high yield, high quality, and reduced costs as the main content, and timely summarized and promoted advanced experience, so that the quality of pig iron has steadily increased, among which the pig iron qualification rate of Baotou Iron and Steel Plant has always remained at 99%.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 29th. The manganese mine workers in Guangxi overfulfilled the annual manganese ore production plan by 4.2% on October 25th.

Since August and September, with the deepening of the movement to oppose Right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and rigorously practice increasing production and practicing economy, the manganese mine workers in Guangxi have become more and more energetic. In one month of September, the manganese ore they mined was equivalent to the total of July and August. The workers of the largest Muguai Manganese Mine carried out a competition between shifts and individuals to "mine on sunny days, wash and dress ore on rainy days," changing the situation of declining output in the rainy season, and the output has risen steadily.

    看，钢铁轻骑队纵马飞奔
    云南和蚌埠专区提前两个月超额完成全年产钢任务
    内蒙古完成生铁年计划广西完成全年锰矿石产量
    据新华社昆明30日电　云南省钢铁工业战线职工在提前三个月完成全年产铁计划之后，又在10月27日提前超额2.38％完成了全年的产钢任务。到27日止，全省的钢产量已相当于去年全年总产量的二点四倍，钢的合格率比去年有很大提高，成本也有很大降低。
    云南省钢铁工业战线提前完成全年计划的出色成就，是总路线的无限威力的又一次证明。
    党的八届八中全会的号召发出以后，全省钢铁工业战线职工更是斗志昂扬，掀起了波澜壮阔的反右倾，鼓干劲，厉行增产节约的群众运动。全省钢产量直线上升，8月比7月增长28.5％，9月又比8月增长32.5％，10月预计比9月增长32％；钢的合格率，7月提高到86.7％，9月又上升到91.5％。
    目前，云南省钢铁工业战线职工正在乘风破浪，继续反右倾、鼓干劲，深入开展增产节约运动，争取在今年最后两个月内再增产更多的钢，同全国钢铁战线职工一道为超额完成一千二百万吨钢的任务而奋斗。
    据新华社合肥电　安徽省蚌埠专区炼钢、轧钢工人在28日提前完成全年的钢和钢材生产计划，向全国群英会报捷。
    蚌埠专区今年建成一点五到三吨的炼钢转炉十一座，一百五十和二百五十毫米的轧机三台，从这些设备建设起来之后，炼钢、轧钢工人刻苦学习，努力掌握技术，使钢和钢材的产量质量不断上升。8月份的产量比7月猛增三倍，10月的平均日产量又比9月份提高了66％。蚌埠钢铁厂一点五吨转炉工人改进了转炉炉衬的配料方法，使炉龄由十炉提高到三十炉以上。
    据新华社呼和浩特31日电　内蒙古自治区已经提前七十六天超额9.1％完成全年产铁计划，生铁合格率达到85％——99％，炼铁成本逐渐降低，围绕炼铁的矿石、耐火材料，焦炭等生产也已超额完成了全年计划。
    从来没有生产过生铁的内蒙古自治区各民族人民，去年以来在“小土群”的基础上建立了许多钢铁基点，并且不断地提高了生产技术水平。呼和浩特钢铁厂和包头钢铁厂等企业的职工，今年开展了以高产、优质和降低成本为内容的增产节约运动，及时总结推广先进经验，使生铁的质量稳步上升，其中包头炼铁厂的生铁合格率始终保持在99％。
    新华社南宁29日电　广西各锰矿职工在10月25日超额4.2％完成了全年的锰矿石生产计划。
    8、9月份以来，广西锰矿职工随着反右倾、鼓干劲，厉行增产节约运动的深入展开，干劲越来越大，他们在9月一个月之内，开采的锰矿石，就相当7、8两月的总和。产量最大的木圭锰矿职工，开展了“晴天起矿，雨天洗矿和选矿”的班与班、个人与个人竞赛，改变了雨季产量下落的状况，产量节节上升。
