    To Accelerate Agricultural Technological Transformation and Produce More and Better Equipment
    Shaanxi Rationally Adjusts Mechanical Industry Layout
    (Our dispatch from Xi'an, November 2nd) Shaanxi Province's mechanical industry is undergoing comprehensive planning and rational layout in accordance with the spirit of "the whole country as a chessboard" and vigorous support for agricultural production, in order to prepare for the continued leap forward in mechanical industry production next year.
    The majority of Shaanxi Province's mechanical industry developed from repair shops during the Great Leap Forward last year. Due to the rapid development, there was not enough time to comprehensively arrange the production of each factory, resulting in some uncoordinated phenomena. For example, most machinery factories were trial-producing main engines without paying attention to the production of accessories, resulting in some machines not being able to be assembled into complete sets due to a lack of individual parts. In addition, some factories had small production capacities and produced many varieties of products, making it impossible to produce in batches, resulting in some products having high costs and poor quality. In order to fully utilize the production capacity of existing enterprises, better organize the province's mechanical industry production, and adapt to the needs of industrial and agricultural production and construction, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to conduct a comprehensive plan for the province's mechanical industry in advance this year, in order to prepare for next year's production.
    In this plan, in addition to strengthening the "missing" and weak links in mechanical industry production, special attention was paid to adapting to the needs of agriculture gradually realizing mechanization and electrification, and strengthening the production of agricultural machinery, irrigation and drainage equipment, and small power generation equipment. With the establishment of people's communes and the rapid development of agricultural construction, the demand for agricultural machinery such as seeders, harvesters, threshers, and power irrigation and drainage machinery has increased rapidly. At present, the agricultural machinery produced by a large agricultural machinery factory in Shaanxi Province and some small agricultural machinery factories in various counties can no longer meet production needs. Therefore, the plan calls for the construction and renovation of several agricultural machinery factories next year, and stipulates that the machinery factories in all counties will be converted into agricultural machinery factories. Several factories will be drawn from the existing medium-sized machinery factories in major cities to specifically undertake the manufacturing tasks of agricultural machinery. Among them, the Xianyang Second Machinery Factory will be converted into a water conservancy machinery factory, specializing in the production of agricultural water pumps and water conservancy machinery; the Xianyang Fourth Machinery Factory will be converted into an agricultural machinery factory, specializing in the production of sprayers.
    The plan also strengthened the repair and assembly capacity of agricultural machinery. The repair and assembly factories for agricultural machinery were rationally arranged, and it was decided to convert the Xi'an Pioneer Automobile Repair Factory into a tractor parts manufacturing factory. In addition, repair factories have been equipped in the plan for some newly developed industrial sectors or departments that did not have professional repair factories in the past.
    According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the Shaanxi Provincial Mechanical Industry System actively began the adjustment work in August. Planning committees for the mechanical industry were established in the province and major cities, and the historical situation, existing scale, equipment situation, technical level of employees, main product varieties, and cooperative relationships of all mechanical factories were investigated. At the same time, the varieties and quantities of products required by the agricultural, commercial, and industrial departments from the mechanical industry were also investigated. On this basis, the production direction, production scale, equipment level, and technical transformation measures of each enterprise were determined. When determining the production scale and direction of the factories, the strengths of each factory were taken into account as much as possible. On the original basis, the existing equipment and products of the factories were adjusted and finalized, and the production order and process were also rectified, in order to fully utilize production potential and overcome some of the current confusion in production. For example, the Baoji Xinqin Machine Factory, because the production direction was not clear in the past and it accepted any task it received, the variety of products was very complicated, which affected the product quality and the improvement of the technical level of employees, and also affected the reduction of costs. In the plan, this factory will be converted into a lifting machinery factory, mainly producing bridge cranes and winches. In this way, the factory employees can continuously improve their technical level and the quality of their products. (Li Qian)

    为加速农业技术改造生产更多更好的设备
    陕西合理调整机械工业布局
    本报西安2日电　陕西省机械工业正在根据“全国一盘棋”和大力支援农业生产的精神，进行全面规划和合理布局，为明年机械工业生产的继续跃进作好准备。
    陕西省的机械工业大部分是在去年大跃进中，从修配厂的基础上发展起来的。由于发展迅速，来不及对各厂的生产进行全面的安排，因此出现了某些不衔接的现象。例如多数机械厂都试制主机，不注意生产配件，致使一些机器因为缺乏个别零件配不成套；还有些工厂生产能力小，产品品种多，不能成批生产，因此出现了某些产品成本高、质量差等现象。为了充分发挥现有企业的生产能力，更好地组织本省机械工业生产，适应工农业生产建设的需要，中共陕西省委决定今年提前对全省机械工业进行全面规划，以便为明年生产作好准备。
    在这次规划中，除加强了机械工业生产中的“缺门”和薄弱环节外，特别注意了适应农业逐步实现机械化和电气化的需要，加强对农业机械、排灌设备、小型发电设备的生产。随着人民公社的建立和农业建设的迅速发展，农业上需要的播种机、收割机、脱谷机、动力排灌机械飞速增加，目前陕西省的一个大型农业机械厂和各县的一些小型农业机械厂生产的农业机械，已经不能满足生产需要。因此，规划中计划明年新建和改建若干农业机械厂，并确定各县的机械厂全部改为农业机械厂。各大城市现有的中型机械厂中抽出几个工厂，专门担负农业机械的制造任务，其中咸阳市第二机械厂改为水利机械厂，专门生产农业用的水泵和水利机械；咸阳市第四机械厂改为农业机械厂，专门生产喷雾器。
    规划中还加强了农业机械的修配力量。对农业机械的修配厂进行了合理的布点，并确定将西安市先锋汽车修配厂改为拖拉机配件制造厂。另外，对一些新发展起来的工业部门或过去没有专业修配厂的部门，在规划中都配备了修配厂。
    陕西省机械工业系统根据省委的指示，在8月份就积极着手进行调整工作，省和各重点城市都成立了机械工业规划委员会，并且对所有机械厂的历史情况、现有规模、设备情况、职工的技术水平、主要产品品种和协作关系等进行了调查。同时，对农业商业和各工业部门要求机械工业生产的产品品种和数量也进行了摸底。在这个基础上，确定每个企业的生产方向、生产规模、装备程度和技术改造的措施等。在确定工厂的生产规模和方向时，尽量照顾各厂的特长。在原有的基础上，对各工厂现有的设备、产品进行调整和定型，对生产秩序和工艺过程也进行整顿，以便充分发挥生产潜力，克服目前生产中的某些混乱现象。例如宝鸡市新秦机器厂，由于过去生产方向不明确，有什么任务接什么任务，因此，产品品种非常复杂，既影响产品质量和职工技术水平的提高，又影响成本的降低。规划中将这个厂改为起重机械厂，主要生产桥式吊车和卷扬机。这样，工厂职工就可以不断地提高技术水平，提高产品的质量。　（李茜）
