At 10 a.m., Albanian party and state leaders Hoxha, Shehu, Leshi, and others ascended the rostrum, causing a long burst of thunderous applause throughout the venue.

Among those attending today's ceremony were all members of the Soviet delegation invited to participate in the festival celebrations, guests from various socialist countries, and foreign diplomatic envoys stationed in Albania.

After General Baluku, First Deputy Chairman of the Albanian Council of Ministers and Minister of Defense, reviewed the troops of various services, he delivered a speech on behalf of the Central Committee of the Labor Party and the government, warmly congratulating the people of the country on the festival.

After the speech, the military parade began. Leading the way were officers who had led the people of their country in heroic struggles and cadets from the Hoxha Junior Officer School. Next, officers and soldiers of the army and navy were reviewed in strict formation.

After the military parade, the mass procession began.

Today, rallies and parades were held in various major cities of Albania to celebrate the great victories of the past fifteen years since liberation.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 28th: A celebration meeting was held in Tirana, the capital of Albania, on the evening of the 28th to grandly celebrate the 15th anniversary of Albania's liberation.

At exactly 5 p.m., party and government leaders such as Hoxha, Shehu, Leshi, and Spiridonov, head of the Soviet delegation, ascended the rostrum, at which point the entire audience stood up and applauded for a long time.

Also attending today's celebration meeting were: all members of the Soviet delegation, writers, journalists, and artists from fraternal countries who came to participate in the celebrations.

Luo Shigao, the Chinese Ambassador to Albania, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Albania were also invited to attend the meeting. Representatives of returned Albanian expatriates also attended the meeting.

The meeting was presided over by Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers. After the national anthems of Albania and the Soviet Union were played, Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, delivered a report.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 28th: Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, said in his report at the celebration meeting in Tirana on the evening of the 28th to celebrate the 15th anniversary of Albania's liberation that Albania's liberation was a major event in Albanian history and a huge turning point in Albanian history.

Hoxha said that under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, the people of our country have carried out socialist construction, fundamentally changing the face of the country in the past fifteen years. With the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and various fraternal countries, Albania has become a developed agricultural and industrial country.

Hoxha said that the unprecedented great achievements Albania has achieved in the past fifteen years prove that the line of our party is correct. Today, Albania's industrial output value accounts for half of the total value of industrial and agricultural production. In the national income, income from industry accounts for 40%. By the end of this year, the total industrial output value will increase twenty-one times compared with 1938 before the war. Hoxha said that our task is to move forward faster and by leaps and bounds, so as to advance side by side with advanced socialist countries.

Speaking of agricultural achievements, Hoxha said that in the past fifteen years, a real revolution has taken place in our country's rural areas. The working peasants of our country, following the instructions of the Party, have enthusiastically embarked on the only correct road—the road of agricultural cooperativization.

Hoxha said that the achievements that the people of our country have achieved in the past fifteen years once again prove that under the leadership of the Labor Party and with the help of our friends, especially the great Soviet Union, we will achieve new and greater achievements. Hoxha, on behalf of the Albanian people, sincerely thanked the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries for their assistance to Albania. He pointed out that the friendship between Albania and the fraternal countries will last forever.

Hoxha then said that in all its activities, our party follows the immortal doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and the rich experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Our party is loyal to the ideas of scientific socialism, and our party is loyal and will continue to wage a principled struggle to thoroughly safeguard the purity of Marxism-Leninism. It will continue to fight for the political and ideological exposure of revisionism in the future, and will resolutely fight for the consolidation of the international communist movement and the workers' movement.

Hoxha sternly condemned the Belgrade revisionists. He pointed out that the activities of the Yugoslav revisionists are part of the activities of international imperialism against the communist movement and the socialist camp.

Hoxha also condemned the shameful behavior of the Yugoslav revisionists in slandering China and the Chinese Communist Party. Hoxha said, "The Yugoslav revisionists accuse glorious China and its heroic Marxist-Leninist party of being war instigators, instigators of the Third World War, and like all imperialists, they are doing their utmost to undermine the glorious labor of the 650 million Chinese people for the cause of peace, for the construction of socialism and communism, and are trying their best to find differences out of nothing."

Hoxha then talked about Albania's foreign policy and the achievements made in this regard. He expressed full support for the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament. He said that the foreign policy of our party and government has always been and will always be a Leninist policy of peace and a policy of friendship among all countries. Friendship with the great Soviet people and the solidarity with all countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is the foundation of Albania's foreign policy.

Hoxha said that Albania is willing to establish relations with all countries that are willing to establish diplomatic relations on the basis of equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in internal affairs. We follow a good-neighborly policy towards Italy, Yugoslavia, and Greece, and hope they will treat us the same way.

Hoxha expressed condemnation of the establishment of atomic weapons and rocket weapons bases in Italy and Greece. He said that the Albanian government resolutely condemns this dangerous step and declares that it fully supports the Soviet government's proposal to turn the Balkan and Adriatic regions into peaceful zones free of atomic and rocket weapons.

    霍查说，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，我国人民进行了社会主义建设，在这十五年内从根本上改变了国家的面貌。阿尔巴尼亚在苏联和各个兄弟国家无私的援助下，已经变成了发达的农业工业国。
    霍查说，阿尔巴尼亚十五年来获得的空前伟大的成就证明了，我们党的路线是正确的。今天，阿尔巴尼亚的工业产值已占工农业生产总值的一半。在国民收入中，来自工业方面的收入占40％，到今年年底工业总产值和战前1938年相比，将增加二十一倍。霍查说，我们的任务是更快地大踏步前进，以便和先进的社会主义国家并排前进。
    在谈到农业成就时，霍查说，十五年来，我国农村进行了真正的革命。我国的劳动农民遵循党的指示，满怀热情地走上了唯一正确的道路——农业合作化的道路。
    霍查说，我国人民十五年来已经取得的成就，再一次地证明了，在劳动党的领导下，在我们的朋友、首先是伟大的苏联的帮助下，我们将会取得新的、更大的成就。霍查代表阿尔巴尼亚人民衷心感谢苏联和其他人民民主国家对阿尔巴尼亚的帮助。他指出，阿尔巴尼亚同各兄弟国家之间的友谊将万古常青。
    霍查接着说，我们党在自己的全部活动中，遵循着马克思列宁主义的不朽学说和苏联共产党的丰富经验。我们党忠实于科学社会主义的思想，我们党忠实地而且将不断地进行原则性的斗争，以彻底维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁性。她今后仍将为从政治上和意识形态上揭露修正主义而斗争，并将坚决地为巩固国际共产主义运动和工人运动而斗争。
    霍查严正地谴责了贝尔格莱德修正主义者。他指出，南斯拉夫修正主义者的活动是国际帝国主义反对共产主义运动和社会主义阵营活动的一部分。
    霍查并且谴责了南斯拉夫修正主义者诬蔑中国和中国共产党的可耻行为。霍查说，“南斯拉夫修正主义者责难光荣的中国和它的英勇的马克思列宁主义政党，说它是战争挑拨者，是第三次世界大战的挑拨者，并且像一切帝国主义者一样，极力破坏六亿五千万中国人民为和平事业、为建设社会主义和共产主义的光荣劳动，无中生有地极力寻找分歧”。
    霍查接着谈到了阿尔巴尼亚的外交政策和在这方面获得的成就。他表示完全支持苏联提出的全面彻底裁军的建议。他说，我们党和政府的外交政策从来是而且将永远是列宁主义的和平政策和各国人民之间友好的政策。同伟大苏联人民的友谊，同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营所有国家的团结一致，是阿尔巴尼亚外交政策的基础。
    霍查说，阿尔巴尼亚愿意在平等、互相尊重、互不干涉内政的条件下，跟一切愿意建立外交关系的国家建立关系。我们遵循着对意大利、南斯拉夫和希腊的睦邻政策，希望它们也这样对待我们。
    霍查表示谴责在意大利和希腊建立原子武器和火箭武器基地的行为。他说，阿尔巴尼亚政府坚决谴责这一危险的步骤，并且声明，它完全支持苏联政府关于把巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区变成无原子武器和火箭武器的和平地区的建议。
