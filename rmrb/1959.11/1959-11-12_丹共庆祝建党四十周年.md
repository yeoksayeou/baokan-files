Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 10th: Copenhagen dispatch: The Chairman of the Danish Communist Party (DKP), Jespersen, delivered a speech on November 7th at a celebration held in a Copenhagen concert hall to mark the fortieth anniversary of the party's founding and the forty-second anniversary of the October Revolution.

	He spoke of the DKP's enormous contributions to the Danish workers' movement since its establishment on November 9, 1919, and warmly congratulated the forty-second anniversary of the October Revolution. He said that a year ago, the DKP's belief in proletarian internationalism and its relationship with the international communist movement had been tested, and it had successfully passed this test. He pointed out that after breaking with the false socialists, the DKP had become even purer and stronger. In discussing the current struggles of the Danish working class, he said that the DKP is a trusted force in the Danish workers' class struggle. The Danish reactionaries are concentrating their attacks on the DKP, opposing social appropriations, demanding increased military spending, and, under the direction of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, demanding the establishment of West German armories (on Danish territory), the import of rocket atomic warheads, and advocating close cooperation with West German militarism. He said that the Danish working class must rise up to stop these acts of betraying the motherland. He said that in 1919, the DKP ignited hope among the Danish working class through the founding of the party, and today it will be the force striving for victory. Jespersen concluded by calling on the entire party to make further efforts, and expressed his gratitude for the great achievements made by party members in the recruitment of new members and fundraising campaign launched to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the party's founding. Jespersen also delivered a radio speech. He emphasized that the DKP's main task at present, as it was when it was founded, is to oppose war and militarism, to oppose exploitation, and to strive for peace and socialism.
	
	To celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the party's founding, communist party organizations in Aarhus and ten other cities have also held various gatherings in recent days.
	
	On the 9th, "Land and People's Daily" published congratulatory messages from fraternal parties of twenty-nine countries, including the Soviet Union and China.

    丹共庆祝建党四十周年
    耶斯佩森号召反对战争和军国主义
    据新华社柏林10日电　哥本哈根消息：丹麦共产党主席耶斯佩森在11月7日在哥本哈根的一个音乐厅举行的党的成立四十周年和十月革命四十二周年庆祝大会上致词。
    他谈到丹麦共产党自从1919年11月9日成立以来在丹麦工人运动中的巨大贡献，并热烈祝贺十月革命四十二周年。他说，一年前，丹麦共产党对无产阶级国际主义的信念和对国际共产主义运动的关系经受了考验，并胜利地通过了这次考验。他指出，同假社会主义者决裂后，丹麦共产党已经更加纯洁和坚强。在谈到丹麦工人阶级当前的斗争时，他说，丹麦共产党是丹麦工人阶级斗争中受人信赖的力量。丹麦反动势力集中攻击丹麦共产党，反对社会性的拨款，要求增加军费负担，他们在北大西洋公约组织的指使下，要求（在丹麦领土上）建立西德军火库，输入火箭的原子弹头并主张和西德军国主义进行密切的合作。他说，丹麦工人阶级必须起来制止这些背叛祖国的行为。他说，1919年丹麦共产党通过建党在丹麦工人阶级中点燃了希望，今天它将是争取胜利的力量。耶斯佩森最后号召全党进一步努力，并对党员在为纪念建党四十周年所发动的吸收新党员和募捐运动中所取得的巨大成就表示感谢。耶斯佩森还发表了一篇广播演说。他着重指出，丹麦共产党目前的主要任务，像它成立时一样，是反对战争和军国主义，反对剥削争取和平和社会主义。
    为庆祝建党四十周年，亚胡斯城等其他十个城市的共产党组织近日来也举行了各种集会。
    9日“国土与人民报”刊登了苏联、中国等二十九个国家兄弟党的贺电。
