    Written in Grief
    —In Memory of Comrade Zhang Jin Yi
    Tang Tao
    On the morning of November 7th, I received the news of Jin Yi's passing, which was another bolt from the blue after Xi Di's tragic death.
    Not long after coming to the North, on the morning of October 18th, I visited Xi Di's tomb at Babaoshan Cemetery in the western suburbs, and in the afternoon, I attended his first death anniversary memorial meeting. For the past year, I have always felt emotionally that Xi Di was still alive, imagining that one day he would appear among us and personally recount the details of his accident, proving that the previous news was just a "Su Dongpo abroad" rumor. Because in my mind, death and the name Zheng Zhenduo were not connected, especially since everything happened so suddenly! However, the inscription on the tombstone was so real, and the eulogies from his friends were so heartfelt that I had to abandon my emotional fantasies and painfully and laboriously acknowledge the fact: Xi Di was truly dead. I couldn't calm myself down the entire evening. And who would have expected that twenty days later, just as my mood was beginning to settle, the mischievous fate forced me to associate the word "death" with another name I was familiar with, another energetic and spirited person—our comrade Zhang Jin Yi. A year ago, he held Xi Di's last will and testament, and we faced each other in tears. Fifty days ago, he held both my hands, anticipating a future reunion. He lived in my heart. The news was so unexpected, like a sudden iron gate crashing down, about to crush me immediately.
    The memory is still fresh; admitting such a word as death is really too difficult for me.
    I met Jin Yi before the War of Resistance Against Japan, but our close interaction began after the War of Resistance Against Japan, when he returned to Shanghai from Chongqing. On the eve of liberation, the Party sent people to contact us. Four or five people would occasionally hold a meeting, the location of which frequently changed, often at some foreigner's office, and we also borrowed the library of the British Information Office, or even held them at my home. In this way, Jin Yi would sometimes come to me without an appointment, excitedly talking about how he clashed with reactionary professors and how he was surrounded by secret agent students. He was very familiar with the situation in the education and literary circles, knew many little stories about devils and monsters, and with a casual remark in his essayist style, he could vividly portray them, making me both angry and amused. My impression of him was that he was enthusiastic, generous, and easy to approach. Although he often seemed unobservant, not profound, and not good at elevating things to a higher level for further analysis when looking at people and matters, he was able to grasp the general outline and sensitively point out the crux of the problem. He had a sense of drive and was always a good partner for discussing military advances during wartime.
    In 1953, we were both transferred to the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Writers Association. Until fifty days ago when I left Shanghai, we had been working together, and for more than two years, we even lived together. I gained a deeper understanding of Jin Yi. We argued about work, even to the point of turning red in the face, but it never affected our friendship. After a storm, either I would examine myself and admit my faults to him, or he would complain to me about his attitude, and we would happily get back to work together. I say that I had a deeper understanding of Jin Yi because during this period, I saw more clearly his strong desire to make progress: in every movement, he always raised the banner and ran at the forefront of the battle. No matter how much mockery a small group of backward people threw at him—I did hear such mockery—he always turned a blind eye and moved forward without hesitation. Regardless of how many shortcomings he had, his yearning for the Party, his love for the Party, his desire to join the advanced ranks of the proletariat, this kind of eager desire could not be doubted, no matter how you put it. Jin Yi often used this to encourage me, hoping that the relationship between us would not be based on personal feelings, but rooted in true comradeship. I have indeed gained much enlightenment from him, and this enlightenment will always shine in my thoughts, and in the future, it will become the ever-flashing spark as I recall him and cherish his memory.
    This summer, Jin Yi was accepted into the Party. I understood the excitement in his heart, but his performance was more composed and more down-to-earth. He clearly realized that this was not an end, but a beginning, the beginning of a new life. He told me that he wanted to write a novel with intellectuals as the theme. I strongly encouraged him. He was familiar with this aspect of life, and now that he was a Party member, if he could describe intellectuals from the ideological height of the Party, this novel would be deeply branded with the imprint of our times and give all intellectuals a profound education in ideological transformation. I was looking forward to such a novel. I believed that Jin Yi had the responsibility and the ability to complete this novel.
    On the eve of my departure from Shanghai, we talked about this novel again. The next afternoon, as my car passed through the alley where he lived, he stood at the entrance of the alley and waved to me. I shouted loudly:
    "I'm waiting to read your novel!"
    Faced with this unexpected news, what else can I say at this moment?
    Jin Yi, why did you leave us just as your life was beginning? Your road is not yet finished, and you still have much work to do. I am waiting to read your novel. It is heartbreaking that now, I can no longer read your novel through printed words. All I can read is the novel you wrote with your own life!
    I understand you, Jin Yi. You must also be regretting it. You would say: even this is still an unfinished novel.
                      Late night, November 7, 1959

    写于悲痛中
    ——悼章靳以同志
    唐弢
    11月7日上午，得到靳以逝世的消息，这是继西谛遇难之后，又一个晴天的霹雳。
    北来以后不久，10月18日清晨，我到西郊八宝山参谒西谛的墓地，下午又出席了他的逝世周年纪念会。一年来，在我的感情上总认为西谛还活着，设想有一天他会在我们中间出现，亲口讲述遇险的经过，证明过去的消息不过是“海外东坡”之谣，因为在我的头脑里，死和郑振铎这个名字是连不到一起的，何况一切都那么突然！可是，墓碑上的铭刻是如此真切，生前友好的致词是如此沉痛，我不得不抛开感情的幻想，痛苦而吃力地承认这个事实：西谛真的死了。整个黄昏我都无法使自己平静。又谁料二十天后，当我的心境刚刚能够平复的时候，造化小儿又逼着我把“死”字去连上另一个我所熟悉的名字，另一个精力充沛、意气风发的人——我们的同志章靳以。一年以前，他拿着西谛的最后遗书和我垂泪相对，五十天前，他握住我的两手预期后会，他在我的心底活着。消息是这样出于意外，仿佛一座突然扑下来的千斤重闸，马上要把我压碎一样。
    记忆犹新，死，承认这样一个字眼在我实在是太困难了。
    我和靳以相识，是在抗日战争之前，而彼此过从，却在抗日战争之后，他从重庆回到上海的时候。解放前夕，党派人和我们联系，四五个人时而开个碰头会，地点经常变换，较多的是在一个什么外国人的事务所里，也借用过英国新闻处的图书馆，或者就在我的家里。这样，靳以有时便不等约会，突然跑来找我，兴致冲冲地谈着怎样和反动教授冲突，怎样受特务学生包围，他对教育界和文艺界的情况很熟悉，知道许多牛鬼蛇神的小故事，用他散文家的口吻随手一撂，居然面目宛然，使我听得又好气，又好笑。他给我的印象是热情，慷慨，容易接近，虽然看人看事往往显得不细致，不深刻，不善于提高起来作进一步的分析，然而却能够观其大略，敏感地指出问题的所在。他有一股冲劲，永远是临阵作战时商量进军的好伙伴。
    1953年我们同时调到中国作家协会上海分会，直到五十天前我离开上海，我们一直工作在一起，有两年多时间还居住在一起。我对靳以有了较深的了解。我们为工作发生过争吵，甚至还闹到面红耳赤，却从来没有因此影响彼此之间的友谊。一阵风暴过后，不是我向他检查自己的不是，便是他向我埋怨自己的态度，大家又高高兴兴地聚在一块工作了。我说我对靳以有较深的了解，因为在这一段时间里，我更清楚地看到他的要求进步的强烈的愿望：每次运动，他总是揭竿搴旗，跑在战斗的前沿，不管一小撮落后的人投给他以怎样的嘲弄——我的确听到过这种嘲弄，他总是掉头不顾，一往无前；不管自己身上有多少缺点，他的向往党，爱党要党，愿意自己成为无产阶级先进队伍里的一员，这种如饥如渴的心情，无论怎样说都不容怀疑。靳以也常常用这点来勗励我，希望我们之间的关系不要以个人感情为基础，而要植根于真正的同志的友谊。我的确从他那里得到过许多教益，这种教益永远在我的思想里发亮，今后更将成为我追忆他、缅怀他的时时闪动的火花。
    今年夏天，靳以被接受入党，我懂得他内心的兴奋，然而他的表现却更沉着，更踏实了，他清楚地意识到：这不是一个终极，而是一个开始，一个新的生命的开始。他告诉我想写一个以知识分子为题材的长篇，我竭力怂恿他，他熟悉这方面的生活，现在他是一个党员，如果能够站在党的思想高度去描写知识分子，这个长篇将深刻地烫上我们时代的烙印，给一切知识分子在思想改造上以深刻的教育。我期待着这样一个长篇。我认为靳以有责任有能力去完成这个长篇。
    当我离开上海的前夕，我们又扯到了这个长篇。第二天下午，我坐车子经过他居住的里弄，他站在弄口向我挥手，我大声叫：
    “等着读你的长篇！”
    面对着这个意外的消息，此刻我又能说些什么呢？
    靳以，你为什么要在生命刚刚开始的时候离开我们？你的路还没有走完，你还有许多工作要做。我在等着读你的长篇。令人痛心的是：现在，我已经不可能通过排印出来的文字读到你的长篇，我所能够读到的，仅仅是你用自己生命写成的长篇！
    我了解你，靳以，你一定也在抱恨，你会说：便连这个，也还是一个未完成的长篇。
                      1959年11月7日深夜
