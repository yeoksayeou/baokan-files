Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 21st: The Japanese Broadcasting Corporation, in a news commentary broadcast on the 18th, said that the Japanese people welcome the suggestion in the letter from Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China to Prime Minister Nehru of India on November 7th, and deeply hope that "both sides will immediately take friendly measures through amicable consultations, earnestly strive to improve the unfortunate situation on the border between the two countries, and fundamentally eliminate the possibility of such conflicts recurring in the future."

Commentator Gaichi Hongo said in the commentary that the Japanese people welcome the spirit of consultation in Premier Zhou's suggestion, "and sincerely hope that Prime Minister Nehru will, in principle, accept this suggestion for the sake of peace in Asia and for the sake of the two countries (China and India)."

The commentary continued: "However, the Japanese people are also watching the situation where this suggestion has not successfully created a conciliatory atmosphere among the Indian people, which is indispensable for resolving through consultation. If prime ministerial talks are held in a situation where the positions of both sides are sharply opposed, it would even be dangerous for the talks to succeed." The commentary said, "The Japanese people dare to strongly hope that India will accept Premier Zhou's suggestion in principle, merely to further develop the spirit of resolving through consultation, so that the differences can be adjusted to a considerable extent through diplomatic means. In order to avoid the current military conflict and eliminate the root of the trouble forever, it is best for both sides to immediately conduct research on demarcating the border. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which form the basis of friendly relations between China and India, originated from the trade agreement between the two countries on Tibet in 1954. The Sino-Indian border is its birthplace. Mutual respect for territorial sovereignty and non-aggression among the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence can only be established after the territory is clearly defined."

Prior to this, many major Japanese newspapers also expressed welcome for Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Prime Minister Nehru on November 7th, hoping that India would accept the suggestions put forward by Premier Zhou in this letter, although these newspapers had made many distortions and slanders against China in the Sino-Indian border incident.

The "Asahi Shimbun" on the 12th hoped that India would accept Premier Zhou's suggestion, saying, "People must strike while the iron is hot. Regardless of what attitude India may take on this dispute, we firmly believe that it would be wise for India to accept the suggestion of holding such a meeting in principle." The newspaper said on the 10th: "The two constructive and specific suggestions put forward by Premier Zhou in his letter are of epoch-making significance. In terms of this significance, Zhou's letter will become the beginning of peacefully resolving the outstanding Sino-Indian border dispute through negotiation, which is noteworthy."

The "Yomiuri Shimbun" published a commentary on the 10th, saying, "As Asians, we strongly hope that Prime Minister Nehru and Premier Zhou will actively develop the spirit of the talks proposed in that (Premier Zhou's) suggestion." The newspaper said on the 12th: "The troublesome incident of the Sino-Indian border dispute seems to have finally taken a step towards resolution due to Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Prime Minister Nehru on the 7th. It can also be said that Zhou Enlai's suggestion is the first step towards resolving the dispute."

The "Mainichi Shimbun" also hoped on the 12th that the problem could be resolved through consultation, saying, "Regardless of what circumstances and intentions the Beijing government has, its attitude of intending to negotiate with India is welcome." The newspaper believes that if India therefore rejects Premier Zhou's suggestion and resorts to force instead of resolving the problem through consultation, "it is indeed dangerous."

    日本广播协会电台和许多报纸欢迎周总理建议
    希望印度接受建议举行会谈
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本广播协会电台在18日广播的一篇新闻述评中说，日本人民欢迎中华人民共和国总理周恩来11月7日给印度的尼赫鲁总理信中的建议，同时深切期望，“双方通过和睦的协商立即采取友好的措施，认真地努力改善两国边境上的不幸状态，并且从根本上消除今后再次发生这种冲突事件的可能性。”
    评论员本乡贺一在这篇评论中说：日本人民欢迎周总理的建议的协商的精神，“并且衷心希望尼赫鲁总理为了亚洲的和平，为了（中印）两国，原则上接受这个建议。”
    评论接着说：“但是，日本人民还正在注视着这样的事态，即这个建议并没有成功地在印度国民中间造成对通过协商解决所不可缺少的和解的气氛。如果在双方的主张尖锐对立的情况下举行总理会谈，为了使会谈成功，甚至倒是危险的。”评论说，“日本人民敢于强烈希望印度在原则上接受周（总理）建议，只不过是期望进一步使协商解决的精神得到发展，以便能够通过外交途径在相当程度上调整这个分歧。为了避免当前的军事冲突，永远除掉祸根，最好是双方立即为划定边界进行研究。成为中印两国友好关系基础的和平五项原则，是在1954年从两国关于西藏的通商协定中产生的。中印边界就是它的发祥之地。和平五项原则中的互相尊重领土主权和互不侵犯，只有领土明确了以后才能确立起来。”
    在这以前，日本许多大报也表示欢迎周恩来总理11月7日给尼赫鲁总理的信件，希望印度接受周总理在这封信中提出的建议，虽然这些报纸在中印边境事件上对中国曾进行了许多歪曲和诬蔑。
    “朝日新闻”12日希望印度接受周总理的建议，它说，“人们必须趁热打铁。不管印度在这个争执上可能采取什么态度，我们坚定地相信，印度在原则上接受举行这种会议的建议将是明智的”。这家报纸10日说：“周总理在信中提出的两项建设性的具体建议具有划时代的意义。就这种意义而言，周的这封信将会成为用谈判方式和平解决悬而未决的中印边境纠纷问题开端，这是值得注意的。”
    “读卖新闻”10日发表评论说，“作为亚洲人，我们强烈希望尼赫鲁总理和周总理将会积极地发展在那个（周总理的）建议中提出的会谈的精神”。这家报纸12日说：“中印边境纠纷这个麻烦的事件，好像也已经由于周恩来总理7日写信给尼赫鲁总理而终于朝着解决的方向跨进了一步。也可以说，周恩来建议是走向解决纠纷的第一步。”
    “每日新闻”12日也希望能用协商的方式解决问题，它说：“不管北京政府是出自什么样的情况和意图，但是它打算同印度进行协商的态度是值得欢迎的。”这家报纸认为，如果印度因此而拒绝了周总理的建议，不用协商的方式解决问题而诉诸武力的话，“实是危险的”。
