Heroes Emerge in Times of Difficulty
    ——An Account of the Advanced Deeds of Li Fuxiang of the Shanghai Boiler Factory

Li Fuxiang, a Shanghai representative attending the National Congress of Heroes, is a worker in the metalworking workshop of the Shanghai Boiler Factory. He is 29 years old this year and a member of the Chinese Communist Party. Since Li Fuxiang began operating a drilling machine in 1955, he has proposed more than 150 technical innovations, including more than 20 major innovations. These have been compiled into a complete set of advanced drilling operation methods, enabling manual operations to be replaced by machinery. Production efficiency has increased from one-fold to a hundred-fold, and people enthusiastically call him a "Drilling Expert." This year, Li Fuxiang left the drilling machine he had operated for many years and went to work on a less advanced boring machine. In six and a half months, he completed the workload of sixteen years and ten months, achieving his guarantee made at the beginning of the year to "do sixteen years of work in one year" ahead of schedule.

Li Fuxiang was born into a tenant farmer family. Due to the pressure of life, at the age of twelve, he followed his father to work as a long-term laborer for a landlord, mowing grass and herding cattle from dawn to dusk, living a life worse than a beast of burden. At the age of seventeen, his father borrowed five *shi* of rice as a deposit to send him from Changzhou to a private machinery factory in Shanghai as an apprentice. There, he had to work fourteen hours a day and suffer beatings and abuse.

In May 1949, Shanghai was liberated. Soon after, Li Fuxiang entered the Shanghai Boiler Factory (formerly the Pujiang Machinery Factory). With the development of the country's construction, the factory went from repairing and assembling products such as electric fans to manufacturing the smallest boilers – the "firecracker boilers" for boiling water – and two-ton and ten-ton boilers. Under the education of the Party, Li Fuxiang saw the bright future of the motherland and deeply felt the importance of his responsibility. His desire for innovation and creation became increasingly strong, and his enthusiasm grew even more.

A Way Can Always Be Found No Matter How Tight the Time
In August 1955, the factory was trial-manufacturing China's first forty-ton medium-pressure boiler as a gift from all the factory's employees to the National Day. However, to complete this arduous task, drilling was the weakest link, because a boiler required more than 2,500 holes to be drilled. According to the calculation of processing man-hours, drilling workers and machine tools had to be increased threefold to solve the problem; otherwise, the completion date would have to be extended. At that time, the factory studied the matter and decided to subcontract part of the task to private factories. After hearing this news, Li Fuxiang immediately went to the leadership and took on the task himself. He said, "There should always be a way, no matter how tight the time is." He was determined to innovate technology and speed up the rotation speed of the drilling machine. From then on, Li Fuxiang spent all day working beside the drilling machine. His face gradually became thinner, and red streaks appeared in his eyeballs, but after several tests, none were successful.

Another new experiment began. After Li Fuxiang sought advice from teachers and friends, he decided to increase the speed of the drilling machine from 350 revolutions per minute to 710 revolutions per minute. As a result of the experiment, the machine tool started, and the drill bit was seen to spin rapidly into a ball of white light, with iron filings flying out "hissing." People had never seen such a high speed of operation before, and they all gathered around the machine tool to watch Li Fuxiang's operation. Suddenly, a puff of green smoke came out of the drill bit, and it snapped into two pieces with a "pop." The onlookers exclaimed "Wow!" thinking that an accident had occurred on the machine tool. Li Fuxiang's head was also covered with beads of sweat the size of soybeans, and he stood blankly beside the drilling machine.

"I told you it wouldn't work. If it could be done, someone would have thought of a way long ago," someone whispered in the crowd.

Li Fuxiang didn't say a word. He replaced the drill bit and tried again. But in the blink of an eye, it broke again. Li Fuxiang wanted to continue trying, but a "well-meaning" material clerk standing next to him reached out and grabbed his arm, saying, "Don't waste the state's property anymore!" Li Fuxiang looked down at the two drill bits, broken into four pieces, lying on the ground. Tears welled up in his eyes, and he squatted down on the ground and whispered to himself, "Yes, it's a failure!…"

It was late at night, but Li Fuxiang had not yet left the drilling machine. He repeatedly recited what the Party branch secretary of the workshop had just told him: "How can there be creation without difficulties! How can there be success without failure!" As he recited, a surge of heat flowed through his body. He suddenly stood up and slowly fiddled with the machine tool. At this time, he found that the drilling machine was running normally, indicating that speeding up the rotation had no impact on the machine tool itself. The key lay in the drill bit.

"Why does the drill bit break?" Li Fuxiang asked himself, and picked up the broken drill bit from the ground, looking at it over and over again. Suddenly, a hint of a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth, and he muttered to himself, "The problem is here: the iron filings rub against the drill bit, causing it to heat up and break." He immediately started thinking, "If I grind a few more grooves on the drill bit to allow the iron filings to escape from the grooves, wouldn't that reduce the friction on the drill bit?" He tried it more than ten times that night. Sure enough, the drill bit not only didn't break, but the production efficiency increased by more than threefold. At this speed, there was no need to add people or machine tools, and the task could be completed three days ahead of schedule. At this time, it was even later at night, and he walked home with light steps. On the way, he saw a noodle stall, and his stomach was rumbling. He remembered that he had only eaten two steamed buns given to him by the Party branch secretary of the workshop since noon. He quickly sat down and ate three large bowls of noodles, causing the noodle vendor to stare at him in amazement.

Do What Others Are Unwilling to Do
In the process of overcoming difficulties, Li Fuxiang deeply realized that difficulties are like springs: if you are hard, they become soft; if you are soft, they become hard. You must not be afraid of difficulties; the more afraid you are, the more difficult they become. Li Fuxiang gradually developed a habit: he often patted his chest and rushed to do things that others dared not do; he would also rush to do things that were clearly not his responsibility, as if they were his own. Strangely enough, things always went the way he thought they would, and he managed them one by one.

In August 1957, Li Fuxiang completed the annual production task ahead of schedule. At this time, the factory was trial-manufacturing a twenty-ton boiler, and there were only ten days left until the date of assembly and delivery. The new product's part, the "waist-shaped flange," required a very high degree of precision. The tolerance was only one-third the thickness of a strand of hair, and the finish had to be as smooth and shiny as a mirror. Originally, it was stipulated that this should be processed by a milling machine, but the work produced was always out of specification. It was then transferred to other machine tools for testing, but it was still unsuccessful. Eventually, some people were unwilling to process this tricky product. The workshop leadership held several emergency scheduling meetings in a row for this matter, but no results were obtained.

After hearing this news, Li Fuxiang hurried to the workshop director: "Director, can the problem of processing the 'waist-shaped flange' be solved?" The workshop director glanced at him, patted the blueprints in his hand, and shook his head. Li Fuxiang puffed out his chest and said, "Let me do this!" "You?… Do you have a way to do this?" "I'm a Party member, I have the determination!" The workshop director looked at him for a long time, then patted Li Fuxiang on the arm and handed him the drawings.

The news that Li Fuxiang took the initiative to request the processing of the "waist-shaped flange" spread quickly. The workers in the workshop gave him a thumbs up, praising Li Fuxiang for being a good man. The support of the masses gave him great encouragement and increased his confidence in overcoming difficulties. Only the worker who worked the same shift as Li Fuxiang complained, "The leadership didn't ask you to do it, why bother looking for trouble? You have already completed your annual plan ahead of schedule. If you scrap it, wouldn't it be a waste of all your previous efforts and affect your reputation as an advanced producer?" Li Fuxiang said, "Personal honor is a small matter; we should think that this task is related to everyone." When he was processing the first "waist-shaped flange" with his newly improved polygonal reamer, he thought that the only road ahead of him was: only success was allowed, no failure was allowed.

The drilling machine rumbled, the reamer spun, and iron filings flew out like stars in the sky, emitting a piercing sound. There was silence all around, and people held their breath, staring intently at Li Fuxiang's hands. It wasn't until the "waist-shaped flange" was taken off the machine tool, inspected by the inspector, and signed to prove that the part was up to specification that Li Fuxiang left the crowd, took a light breath, and wiped the sweat from his brow.

This year, with the continued Great Leap Forward across the country, many newly built factories and people's communes needed electricity, which required the boiler factory to produce more boilers to support power generation equipment. In February, the factory manufactured a six-story-high 280-ton medium-pressure boiler, which was scheduled to be completed in early March. One of the main parts – the processing of large screws – became a "stumbling block." These screws were as big as rice bowls, and four workers had to manually tap the threads, each sweating profusely, and it took two days to process just one. When Li Fuxiang saw this situation, he was very anxious. If this continued, it would take more than a month to make eighteen screws, which would affect the timely assembly and delivery of the entire boiler. A complete set of power station equipment, without boilers, could not generate strong electricity, which would delay the country's economic construction. In order to help the workers overcome the difficulties of tapping threads, Li Fuxiang decided to use a drilling machine to replace manual processing. However, when the drilling machine was started, the "tap" always broke the "teeth" of the screw. The experiment failed. Li Fuxiang was not discouraged. He learned from the failure and worked overnight to make a set of clamps, which he installed on the drilling machine. As a result, four or five screws could be processed in eight hours, and the production efficiency was increased by dozens of times, and the quality was better than that of manual operation.

It was in this way that Li Fuxiang was repeatedly encouraged by the Party and repeatedly overcame difficulties in the process of overcoming various difficulties and constantly innovating technology, and he also repeatedly achieved achievements in technological innovation. In the past five years, there have been more than 20 major technological innovations on the drilling machine he operated. The drill bit alone has been improved nine times, from changing the shape and angle of the drill bit to making multi-faceted, multi-functional drill bits; from changing the two processes of drilling and tapping threads to completing them in one process; from 30% manual operation of drilling workers to the development of complete mechanization, and the production efficiency has also increased one-fold, ten-fold, fifty-fold, and one hundred-fold.

Embracing New Difficulties
In February of this year, the boring machine became one of the key factors in the factory's production, and the processing of parts often could not meet the needs of assembly on time. At that time, in order to meet the needs of production, the workshop leadership decided to transfer Li Fuxiang to switch to boring work, and also asked him to lead all the boring workers to advance together.

Such a transfer was not without difficulties for Li Fuxiang. Li Fuxiang was leaving the drilling machine he had operated for many years to operate a boring machine, and he had to learn the technology from scratch. But when he thought that he was a Communist Party member and an advanced producer, he felt a great responsibility and a sense of duty. Therefore, he unhesitatingly obeyed the organization's assignment.

This spring, Shanghai was filled with a vibrant scene of continued Great Leap Forward. The Municipal Party Committee's industrial conference put forward the call to "one person equals one and a half people," which was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Like many factories in the city, the Shanghai Boiler Factory launched a heated competition to "compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced." Guarantees such as "one person equals two people," "one year equals eight years of work," and "one year equals fifteen years of work" swept through the factory like a spring breeze. Li Fuxiang's heart was excited for a long time. At this time, he had just started operating the boring machine, and he couldn't even drive well in forward or reverse. He thought: Last year, he had implemented more than 30 technological innovations on the familiar drilling machine, and completed three years of work in seven months of actual working days. This year, he was newly elected as a representative to the National People's Congress, and attending meetings and inspecting work would take up some of his production time; moreover, he had just been transferred from the drilling machine to the boring machine to operate, so how could he innovate technology? When the Party branch secretary of the workshop learned about Li Fuxiang's concerns, he said to him: "Although your production time is short and you are a novice on the boring machine, you have a heart of unwavering loyalty to the Party and more than ten years of operating experience. As long as you carry forward your past spirit of being willing to use your brain, find tricks, not be afraid of difficulties, and dare to innovate, you will definitely be able to catch up with and surpass your competitors." Encouraged and supported by the Party, Li Fuxiang made a guarantee of "doing sixteen years of work in one year" and challenged his competitors. He studied technology day and night. At the beginning, he was like an apprentice who had just entered the factory, learning humbly and stubbornly from the master craftsmen. In just over a month, he quickly mastered the operating technology of the boring machine. During the operation of the boring machine, he discovered problems and started innovating again. When processing the blank of a part on the boring machine, it was necessary to adjust the tool after boring the first cut. Adjusting the tool manually was always not accurate enough. If the bored hole was too large, it would be scrapped; if it was too small, it would have to be reworked from scratch. Adjusting the tool took up about half of the production time in a day. After several days and nights of research, Li Fuxiang finally developed a "eccentric live boring row" tool that could replace manual adjustment. When he applied the "eccentric live boring row" to process the gear case, the production time was repeatedly compressed, from the original 24 hours to 13 hours, 6 hours, and finally 4 hours and 20 minutes to complete one. Li Fuxiang's new creation broke the superstition that it was difficult to improve the production efficiency of the boring machine. The boring machine workers learned from Li Fuxiang's experience and also carried out technical innovations. In more than half a year, the workers of the boring machine group put forward more than 100 technical innovation suggestions. In August and September, the whole group generally overfulfilled the task, and there was a full red situation that had never been seen before. Li Fuxiang also put forward more than 30 innovation suggestions such as multi-knife multi-blade and high-speed boring, which increased the production efficiency of various processed parts by 50% to six times, and also overfulfilled the task every month. In September, he completed the entire month's task in 12 working days. In October, he completed the entire month's task in 7 working days. Since the beginning of this year, he has put forward a total of 59 innovation projects, saving more than 34,000 man-hours. At the same time, as of October 17, he completed the workload of 16 years and 10 months in 6 and a half months of production time, achieving the guarantee he made to the Party at the beginning of the year ahead of schedule. Under the leadership of Li Fuxiang, the boring machine group, which had always been relatively backward, also became an advanced collective in the factory.

Everyone Being Good Is What Makes a Hero
Li Fuxiang not only worked hard on his own, but also enthusiastically imparted his skills, hoping that others would improve their technical level as soon as possible. In recent years, he has been invited to Hangzhou, Jinan, Tianjin and other places to promote advanced drilling operation methods, helped more than 40 factories solve key production problems, and taught advanced technology to more than 60 drilling workers. Since last year, he has sent out more than 60 drafts of reformed tools and technical materials to factories across the country. In some places, drilling machine workers, while learning technology from him, put forward suggestions for carrying out friendship competitions. Lu Shunrong, a drilling worker at the Hefei Mining Machinery Factory in Anhui Province, was one of them. The two of them had never met and only kept in touch by correspondence to compete. Li Fuxiang told his competitors everything he knew without reservation. Once, Li Fuxiang drew a diagram of a "live fixture" and sent it to him. Soon after, Lu Shunrong wrote back saying that the "live fixture" he made according to Li Fuxiang's diagram had a good effect when applied to production. However, the product that Li Fuxiang was processing was too large, and the "live fixture" was not suitable. However, Li Fuxiang was still very happy, because his innovation had bloomed and borne fruit in Hefei. Li Fuxiang often said, "The burden of national construction is borne by everyone, and technological innovation is also a matter for everyone. One person standing out is not a good man; everyone being good is what makes a hero."

The reason why Li Fuxiang is called a "Drilling Expert," has been selected as an advanced producer in Shanghai every year since 1955, and has attended the National Congress of Advanced Producers many times is not only because he is a production expert, but also because he is a person with a communist style. He is not only a pathfinder, but also has a bright red heart of the working class. He is unswervingly loyal to the Party, humble and enthusiastic to the masses, fearless in the face of difficulties, and always holds high the red flag in labor and life, and always remembers that he is a Communist Party member and an advanced member of the working class.

    困难当中出英雄
    ——记上海锅炉厂李福祥的先进事迹
    出席全国群英大会的上海代表李福祥，是上海锅炉厂金工车间工人，今年二十九岁，中共党员。从1955年李福祥在钻床上操作以来，提出了一百五十多项技术革新，其中二十多项重大的革新，汇集成一整套的钻工先进操作法，使原有的手工操作，可以用机械代替，生产效率分别提高了一倍到一百倍不等，人们热情地称他为“钻家”。今年，李福祥离开了多年操作的钻床，到生产比较落后的镗床去工作。他在六个半月的日子里，完成十六年零十个月的工作量，提前实现了他在年初提出的“一年干十六年活”的保证。
    李福祥出身于雇农家庭。由于生活的逼迫，他在十二岁的时候，就跟着父亲到地主家去当长工，每天起早摸黑地割草放牛，过着牛马不如的生活。到了十七岁，父亲借了五石米的押金，把他从常州送到上海一家私营机器厂当学徒，在那里，他一天要干十四小时的活，还得挨打受气。
    1949年5月，上海解放了。不久，李福祥进了上海锅炉厂（前浦江机器厂）。随着国家建设事业的发展，厂里从原来修配电风扇等产品，到开始制造最小的锅炉——烧开水的“炮仗锅炉”、两吨和十吨的锅炉。在党的教育下，李福祥看清了祖国美好的前途，深深感到自己责任的重大，革新、创造的欲望越来越高，干劲越来越足。
    时间再紧也能有办法
    1955年8月，厂里正在试制我国第一台四十吨的中压锅炉，作为全厂职工向国庆节的献礼。但是，要完成这项艰巨的任务，钻工是个最薄弱的环节，因为一台锅炉要钻二千五百多个眼子。按照加工工时计算，钻工和机床要增加三倍才能解决问题，否则只好延长完工日期。当时，厂里作了研究，决定把一部分任务外包给私营厂做。李福祥听到这个消息以后，马上找到领导，把这件事揽到自己身上来。他说：“时间再紧，也应该是有办法的。”他下定决心革新技术，加快钻床的转速。从此，李福祥整天在钻床旁边转。他的脸渐渐地瘦了，眼球里出现了红丝，但是试验了几次，都没有成功。
    又一次新的试验开始了。李福祥求师访友回来以后，决定把钻床转速从每分钟三百五十转提高到七百一十转。试验结果，机床开动了，只见钻头飞快地旋转成一团白光，铁屑“嘶嘶”飞溅出来。用这样高的速度操作，人们过去还没有看见过，都团团围在机床旁边看李福祥的操作。突然，钻头冒起了一阵青烟，“啪”地折成两段。看的人“哇”地惊叫起来，以为机床发生了事故，李福祥头上也冒出黄豆般的大汗珠，呆呆地站在钻床旁边。
    “我说不行就不行，要行，别人早把办法想出来了。”人群里有人低声议论着。
    李福祥听了，一声没吭，换了把钻头，又试起来。但是，一霎眼又断了。李福祥还想试下去，旁边站着一位“好心”的材料员，伸手抓住他的臂膀说：“别再浪费国家的财产了！”李福祥低头看到两根折成四段的钻头放在地下，他眼眶里闪出了泪花，一下子蹲到地上，轻轻地自语道：“是呀，失败啦！……”
    夜深了，李福祥还没有离开钻床。他重复地念着车间党支部书记刚才跟他说的话：“没有困难，怎会有创造！没有失败，怎会有成功！”念着，念着，一股热流在他身上流动着。他突然站了起来，慢慢地摆弄着机床，这时候，他发现钻床运转很正常，说明加快转速，对机床本身没有什么影响，关键却在钻头上。
    “钻头为什么会折断呢？”李福祥追问着自己，并从地上拾起了折断的钻头，反反复复地看了又看。忽然，他的嘴角边透出一丝微笑，暗暗自语道：“毛病原来在这里：是铁屑磨擦钻头发热而断裂。”他马上动起脑筋来，心想：“要是把钻头多磨几道槽子，让铁屑从槽子里冒出来，那不是减少了钻头的磨擦吗？他连夜试了十几次，果然，钻头不但不断，生产效率提高了三倍以上，按照这个速度，不用添人、也不用添机床，还可以提前三天完成任务。这时，夜更深了，他才踏着轻快的脚步回家。走到半路，看见一个面摊，肚里也叽叽咕咕地叫了起来，他想起自己从中午到现在，仅仅吃过车间党支部书记送给的两个馒头。他连忙坐了下来，一下吃了三大碗面，弄得卖面的服务员看着他直发楞。
    干别人不愿干的事
    在克服困难的过程中，李福祥深深地体会到：困难像弹簧，你硬它就软，你软它就硬；困难决不能怕它，越怕越困难。李福祥逐渐养成了一个习惯：人家不敢干的事，他往往胸脯一拍，抢着去干；明明不是他管的事，他也会当做自己的事抢着去干。说来也怪，事情偏偏都照他想的那样，一件件依他管了，也一件件给他管好了。
    1957年8月，李福祥提前完成了全年生产任务。这时候，厂里正在试制二十吨的锅炉，距离装配出厂的日子只有十天了。新产品的零件“腰形法兰”，是个精密度要求很高的活，公差只允许是一根头发丝的三分之一粗细，光洁度要亮滑得像面镜子。原来规定这是由铣床加工的，但做出来的活总是不合规格；再转到其它机床上去试验，还是不成功。弄到后来，有些人都不愿加工这批棘手的产品，车间领导为了这件事，一连开了几次紧急调度会，也得不出结果。
    李福祥听到这个消息以后，就急急忙忙去找车间主任：“主任，‘腰形法兰’加工的问题能解决吗？”车间主任看了他一眼，拍拍手上的图纸，摇了摇头。李福祥挺起胸脯说：“这批活让我来做吧！”“你？……这活你也有办法吗？”“我是党员，我有决心！”车间主任对他看了好一会，后来就拍了拍李福祥的臂膀，把图样交给了他。
    李福祥主动要求加工“腰形法兰”的消息很快就传开了。车间的工人们竖起了大拇指，夸奖李福祥是好样的。群众的支持，给了他很大的鼓舞，增加了他克服困难的信心。唯有跟李福祥一个搭班的工人埋怨说：“领导上没要你做，你何必自找麻烦。你的年度计划已经提前完成，万一做了报废，岂不是前功尽弃，影响先进生产者的名誉。”李福祥说：“个人的荣誉事小，应该想到这个任务是关系大家的事。”当他拿着自己新改进的多角形铰刀加工第一个“腰形法兰”的时候，想到自己面前唯一的道路是：只许成功，不许失败。
    钻床轰隆隆地响着，铰刀滴溜溜地转着；铁屑满天星地飞溅出来，发出一阵阵刺耳的叫声。四周鸦雀无声，人们屏着气，目不转睛地看着李福祥的一双手。一直等到“腰形法兰”从机床上拿下来，经过检验员检查，签字证明了零件合乎规格的时候，李福祥才离开人群，轻轻地吐口气，抹去满头的汗珠。
    今年，随着全国各地的继续跃进，许多新建的工厂和人民公社需要用电，这就要求锅炉厂生产出更多的锅炉供给发电设备配套。2月份，厂里制造有六层楼高的二百八十吨中压锅炉，规定在3月初完成。其中主要零件之一——大螺丝的加工，成了“拦路虎”。这种螺丝有饭碗那么大，四个工人用手工围着攻螺丝，个个累得汗流浃背，两天才能加工好一只。李福祥看到这种情况，很着急，照这样干下去，十八只螺丝，要搞一个多月，将影响整台锅炉的按时装配出厂。成套的电站设备，缺了锅炉，就不能发出强大的电力，延缓了国家的经济建设。李福祥为了帮助攻螺丝的工人克服困难，决心用钻床代替手工加工螺丝。可是，钻床开动起来，“螺丝攻”总是把螺丝的“牙齿”崩坏。试验失败了。李福祥并没有灰心，他吸取了失败的教训，连夜赶制了一套夹具，装在钻床上，结果八小时就加工了四、五个螺丝，生产效率提高几十倍，质量比手工操作的还好。
    李福祥就是这样在克服各种困难、不断革新技术的过程中，一次又一次地得到党的鼓励，一次又一次地克服了困难，也一次又一次地获得了革新技术的成就。近五年来，在他操作的钻床上，重大的技术革新就有二十多项，仅在钻头上就改进了九次，由改变钻头的形状、角度，到制成多面、多能钻头；从钻孔、攻螺丝两道工序改为一道完成；从钻工30％手工操作，发展到全部机械化，生产效率也一倍、十倍、五十倍、一百倍地提高。
    迎接新的困难
    今年2月，镗床成为全厂生产关键之一，零件加工经常不能按时供应装配的需要。当时，车间领导为了适应生产需要，决定把李福祥调去改行做镗工，并且要他带动所有镗工，共同前进。
    这样的调动，对李福祥来说，并不是没有困难的。李福祥离开他多年操作的钻床，到镗床去操作，技术要从头学起，但是当他想到自己是个共产党员，又是先进生产者的时候，感到责任重大，义不容辞，因此就毫不犹豫地服从了组织的调配。
    今年春天，上海充满着一片生气蓬勃的继续跃进的景象。市委工业会议提出“一个人顶一个半人”的号召，深入人心。上海锅炉厂和全市许多工厂一样，掀起了热火朝天的“比先进、学先进、赶先进”的竞赛。“一个人顶两个人”、“一年干八年活”、“一年干十五年活”的保证，像春风一样吹遍了全厂。李福祥心里激动得久久不能平静。这时候，他初到镗床上操作，甚至连顺车、倒车都开不好。他心想：去年，自己在熟悉的钻床上操作，实现了三十多项技术革新，七个月的实际工作日完成了三年的工作量。今年，自己又新当选为全国人民代表大会代表，开会、视察工作要占去一部分生产时间；况且，自己又刚从钻床调到镗床上来操作，怎么革新技术呢？车间党支部书记知道了李福祥的心事，就对他说：“虽然你的生产时间少，在镗床上又是新手，但是你有一颗对党的赤胆忠心，有十多年的操作经验，只要发扬你过去肯动脑筋、找窍门、不怕困难、勇于革新的精神，是一定能够赶上和超过竞赛对手的。”在党的鼓舞和支持下，李福祥提出了“一年干十六年”的保证，向竞赛对手们应战。他夜以继日地钻研技术。开始，他就像刚进厂的学徒那样，虚心地顽强地向老师傅学习。在短短一个多月的时间里，就迅速掌握了镗床的操作技术。他在镗床的操作过程中，发现了问题，又搞起了革新。在镗床上加工零件毛坯的时候，镗了第一刀以后，就要调整刀具。用手工调整刀具，总是不够准确，镗的孔过大，就要报废，过小又要从新返工。一天的生产时间，调整刀具就占了一半左右。李福祥经过几天的日夜钻研，终于研究出用一种“偏心活络镗排”的工具，可以代替手工调整。他在应用“偏心活络镗排”加工牙齿箱的时候，生产时间一再压缩，从原来的二十四小时缩短到十三小时、六小时，最后到四小时二十分就完成了一个。李福祥新的创造，打破了镗床生产效率很难提高的迷信。镗床工人们学习了李福祥的经验，也大搞技术革新。半年多以来，镗床组的工人提出了一百多项技术革新建议，八、九两月，全组普遍超额完成了任务，出现了过去从没有过的满堂红局面。李福祥也提出了多刀多刃、高速膛孔等三十多项革新建议，使各种加工件的生产效率提高了50％到六倍，并且月月超额完成任务。9月份，他以十二个工作日完成了全月的任务。10月份则以七个工作日完成了全月的任务。今年以来，他共提出了五十九项革新项目，节约工时三万四千多个，同时，到10月17日为止，以六个半月的生产时间，完成了十六年零十个月的工作量，提前实现了年初向党的保证。一向比较落后的镗床组，在李福祥的带动下，也一跃成为全厂的先进集体。
    大家都好才是英雄
    李福祥不单是自己苦钻苦干，还热情地传授技术，期望别人尽快地提高技术水平。近几年来，他先后应邀到杭州、济南、天津等地推广钻工先进操作法，帮助了四十多个工厂解决了生产关键，向六十多个钻工传授了先进技术。去年以来，他曾经向全国各地工厂送出了六十多份改革工具的草图和技术资料。有些地方，钻床工人向他学习技术的同时，提出了开展友谊竞赛的建议。安徽省合肥矿山机器厂的钻工陆顺荣，就是其中的一个。他们两人没有见过面，只靠通信联系进行竞赛。李福祥对于竞赛对手，只要是自己知道的，就毫无保留地告诉对手。有一次，李福祥画了一个“活络夹具”的图样寄给他。不久，陆顺荣来信说，他根据李福祥的图样制成的“活络夹具”应用在生产上，效果很好。而李福祥所加工的产品太大，这件“活络夹具”却不适用。但是，李福祥还是很高兴，因为他的革新已经在合肥开了花，结了果。李福祥常说：“国家建设的担子是大家挑的，技术革新也是众人的事。一人出众，不算好汉；大家都好，才是英雄。”
    李福祥之所以被人们称为“钻家”，从1955年起，年年被评选为上海市先进生产者，并且多次出席全国先进生产者大会，不仅因为他是生产能手，而且也因为他是有共产主义风格的人。他不仅是一员闯将，而且有一颗鲜艳的工人阶级的红心。他对党赤胆忠心，对群众谦虚热情，在困难面前，一无畏惧，在劳动和生活里永远高举着红旗，永远记住自己是个共产党员，是工人阶级的一个先进分子。
