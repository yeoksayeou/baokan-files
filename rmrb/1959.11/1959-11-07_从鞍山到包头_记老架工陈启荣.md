    From Anshan to Baotou – A Record of Old Rigger Chen Qirong
    Last June, Chen Qirong went from Anshan to Baotou.
    At that time, more than a hundred installation workers set off from Anshan with him. They were all dispatched by Ansteel’s Mechanical Installation Company to support the construction of the Baotou Iron and Steel Base. Among them, Chen Qirong was the oldest, in his fifties this year; he also had the longest seniority and the most experience: he had been learning rigging skills since he was a teenager, traveling all over Northeast China to places like Anshan, Benxi, and Dalian, and had been doing it for over thirty years. People only needed to look at his thin, dark face, covered with wrinkles, and his calloused, strong hands to know that he was an old worker who had worked on projects for decades. At that time, some young workers who liked to joke said, "Old Master Chen, Inner Mongolia is far away, the wind is strong, and the Yellow River water is cold; you've been in the Northeast for many years, with a family and a comfortable life, why are you thinking of going there to drink northwest wind and taste Yellow River water?" Chen Qirong smiled and pretended not to hear. In fact, who knew that this old worker had a passionate, youthful heart. When the company leaders mobilized people to support Baotou Steel, he was unwilling to fall behind the young people, and rushed to the leaders to express: "...Inner Mongolia has a vast land and a sparse population, and Baotou Steel construction needs people, and the large blast furnace is waiting for people to install it, so send me there!..."
    Yes, Baotou Steel construction needs people, and Baotou is indeed a place that attracts builders. Which ambitious worker doesn't want to lay a brick for the new industrial base, and doesn't want to contribute their technology to the country's great construction project. The installation workers all came to Baotou with enthusiasm for building a new industrial base for the motherland. They had all worked on large projects in Anshan and Benxi; but when they came to Baotou, they couldn't help but feel surprised and delighted by the construction style of the new industrial base. Seeing this scene, Chen Qirong excitedly said to others, "Let's work hard. Doing projects in this place is all the newest and biggest, how enjoyable! Look, no matter how many large factories there are, this place can hold them..." From that time on, old rigger Chen Qirong loved Baotou Steel even more.

    Heart on the Blast Furnace While in the Hospital Bed
    In the autumn, the civil engineering of Blast Furnace No. 1 progressed rapidly, and the installation workers began to prepare for the installation. Their first task was to install a giant tower crane. In order to make the first contribution to the construction of the blast furnace, the riggers decided to shorten the installation period of the crane from more than two months to one month. Everyone was energetic and full of enthusiasm. However, it was at this time that Chen Qirong encountered an unexpected misfortune: during the installation of the crane, due to the negligence of other workers in the group, the machine hit his chest, and three ribs were injured. As a result, he was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment.
    Chen Qirong was strong and sturdy, and his injuries gradually improved after a few days of treatment. He was a restless person. Although he was still lying in the hospital bed, his heart had already gone to the large blast furnace; before his body had recovered, he was anxious to be discharged. Whenever someone went to visit him, he eagerly inquired about the progress of the blast furnace project. The comrades all knew his temper and had to tell him: because the materials were not complete, there was very little work to do at the moment, and he should continue to rest and recuperate. Hearing this, he was always skeptical, and often climbed to the mound opposite the hospital alone to look at the construction site. Because it was far away, he couldn't see clearly, so one day he simply sneaked out of the hospital and ran out to see. After walking more than a mile, he vaguely saw that the blast furnace had already risen halfway. At this point, Chen Qirong returned to the hospital and repeatedly requested to be discharged. The doctor did not allow it. On this day, Tian Rongfeng, the chairman of the team's trade union, happened to visit him. He was so anxious that he jumped up and down, saying, "Old Tian, I can't stay here for another day. The large blast furnace has begun installation, everyone is leaping forward, I can't contribute, and the country has to pay for my medical expenses, isn't this becoming a waste..." At his repeated requests, the doctor had to agree to his discharge, but instructed him not to do too much physical labor when he returned to the construction site, and to rest more. However, when he returned to the construction site, he forgot about it and worked like everyone else, and no one could stop him.

    Thinking Hard About Rationalization Proposals
    In May of this year, the blast furnace equipment installation project entered a tense stage. The inclined bridge was installed, and the next step was to install the main winch. At this time, the Baotou Steel Party Committee issued a call to strive for the early tapping of iron from Blast Furnace No. 1. This call was like a torch, igniting the enthusiasm of more than 10,000 blast furnace builders even more vigorously. All construction teams and workers of all trades投入 all threw themselves into intense labor. The project progress continued to leap forward. The Ironmaking Area Command requested that the then key task – the installation of the main winch base and drum – be completed within ten days. This arduous task fell on the shoulders of the riggers. At that time, there were many difficulties facing the riggers: the hoisting tool, the clamp, was small, with a self-weight of only fifteen tons, while the drum weighed twenty tons and the base weighed eighteen tons, which was unsafe for lifting; if the clamp was reinforced, it would take too much time, and the construction period would be delayed, and it would be impossible to complete the task in ten days. How to solve such a difficulty? Everyone in the team was worried about this. One day, Chen Qirong had dinner at the construction site and did not go home. He ran to the site alone, walking back and forth in front of the blast furnace, observing the terrain and thinking about the lifting method.
    At this time, the furnace body of the blast furnace had already been installed. Its steel body, more than seventy meters high, stood in the center of the construction site like a giant wearing armor, backing the faintly visible Ula Mountains in the starlight, appearing very majestic and spectacular. The tall hot blast stoves, scrubbers, and dust collectors also stood towering around the blast furnace. The construction site was brightly lit, and the sparks of electric welding flickered everywhere. Standing at the foot of the blast furnace, Chen Qirong couldn't help but feel a thousand emotions: in just one year, the grassland had changed greatly. This world-class blast furnace was about to produce molten iron. This was truly a great leap forward! He also remembered that before liberation, Japanese imperialists used two or three years to build a small blast furnace; after liberation, during the recovery period in Anshan and later in Benxi, he also participated in the installation of several blast furnaces. At that time, he felt that each one was bigger and newer than the last, and he was extremely happy. However, comparing them with this large blast furnace now, they were far behind. He also recalled the Party Committee's call to strive for early tapping of iron, and the Party Branch Secretary's usual conversations with him: "It is a remarkable thing to build such a blast furnace in Inner Mongolia ahead of schedule. We are in a leap forward, and our leap forward cannot stop..."
    "I am a Communist Party member, I must overcome any difficulties and let the blast furnace produce molten iron early!" Chen Qirong was so determined.
    The sky was dark, and the late spring night was still slightly chilly. Chen Qirong was thinking about the lifting method under the blast furnace alone, calculating the weight and load of the tools and equipment. Unknowingly, it passed eleven o'clock. The old rigger simply didn't go home and ran to the rest shed to continue considering his rationalization proposals. Early the next morning, he put forward his ideas to the team leaders, suggesting that another steel brace be added to the north side of the clamp and a chain hoist be erected on the south side. In this way, the clamp did not need to be reinforced and could be safely lifted. This method was researched and supplemented by the team leaders and workers in the group, and was finally adopted. The construction problem was finally solved. As a result, the ten-day construction period was completed in six days.

    The Blast Furnace Produces Molten Iron
    The builders of the blast furnace encountered one difficulty after another in the construction, and they continued to achieve victories by overcoming difficulties. By August, only the installation of the furnace top equipment remained for the blast furnace installation project. Chen Qirong and the workers in the group actively responded to the new battle call of the Party Committee to "ensure iron is tapped in September, welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, and offer a gift to Chairman Mao", and arranged the installation progress into a daily and hourly plan, which was implemented and checked on a daily and hourly basis. In those days, Chen Qirong rarely left the furnace top. When he was tired, others advised him and the comrades in the group to pay attention to rest, but they always replied: It is a big deal for the blast furnace to produce iron early. It is not too late to rest after seeing the molten iron. We must fight this last battle well!
    The last battle was the hoisting project of the two large cover balance bars on the top of the furnace. Chen Qirong showed his skills again in this battle. The balance bar was three meters long and weighed three or four thousand kilograms; to hoist it to the top of the furnace, the clamp could not lift it, and the tower crane was not long enough to get in. This was another problem. At this time, some young workers all looked at Chen Qirong, hoping that he would come up with an idea. Chen Qirong was indeed calm, thought repeatedly, and proposed a "step-by-step" method: add a vertical column under the gas vent platform, and install a chain hoist on the platform, first use a tower crane to hoist the balance bar to the platform, and then use a chain hoist to transport it up. This method was indeed effective, and as a result, they completed the task two days ahead of schedule. At that time, everyone who saw Chen Qirong directing the hoisting of this project praised the riggers' method as ingenious.
    The blast furnace installation project ended quickly. Soon, this large blast furnace produced its first furnace of molten iron on September 26. On the eve of attending the "National Heroes Conference" in Beijing, old rigger Chen Qirong said excitedly: "The early tapping of iron from Blast Furnace No. 1 is mainly due to the correct leadership of the Party, the guidance of the Party's General Line, and everyone's hard work. We will never be arrogant, and we must continue to leap forward under the leadership of the Party, and ensure that the construction of Blast Furnace No. 2 is faster and better, and make Inner Mongolia more beautiful!"

    从鞍山到包头——记老架工陈启荣
    去年6月，陈启荣从鞍山到了包头。
    当时，同他一起从鞍山启程的还有一百多个安装工人。他们都是鞍钢机装公司派去支援包头钢铁基地建设的。他们之中，数陈启荣的年纪最大，今年五十多岁了；也数他的工龄长、经历多：从十多岁学架工手艺，跑遍东北的鞍山、本溪、大连等地，到现在已经三十多年。人们只要一看他那瘦黑的、起了不少皱纹的脸和一双长满老茧的、有力的手，就知道他是个干过几十年工程的老工人。当时，有些爱开玩笑的年轻工人说：“老陈师傅呀，内蒙古路远、风大，黄河的水凉；你在东北多年，有家有小，生活挺安逸，怎么也想着到那儿去喝西北风、尝尝黄河水？”陈启荣听了笑笑，只作没听见。其实，有谁知道这个老工人胸膛里怀着的是一颗火热的年青的心。当公司领导上动员人们支援包钢的时候，他不甘心落在青年人的后面，争先跑去找领导表示：“……内蒙古地大人少，包钢建设需要人，大高炉等着人去安装，那就派我去吧！……”
    是的，包钢建设需要人，包钢也确实是个吸引建设者的地方。哪个有志气的工人，不想为新工业基地砌上一块砖，不想把自己的技术贡献给祖国伟大的建设工程。安装工人们一个个都怀着建设祖国新工业基地的热情来到包钢。他们全都是在鞍山、本溪干过大工程的人；可是当他们来到包头以后，看到新工业基地的建设气魄，也不禁感到吃惊和喜悦。看到这景色，陈启荣兴奋地对人说：“咱们使劲儿干吧，在这地方干工程，一切都是最新的、最大的，有多痛快！你看，再有多少大的工厂，这里也搁得下……”从那时候起，老架工陈启荣更加热爱包钢了。
    身在病床　心在高炉
    入秋，一号高炉的土建工程进展得很快，安装工人跟着就动手做安装的准备。他们的第一个任务，是安装一台巨型塔式起重机。架工们为了在高炉建设中立第一功，决定把起重机的安装工期从两个多月缩短到一个月，一个个精神奋发、干劲十足。可是，正是这时候，陈启荣遇到了意外的不幸：在安装起重机的时候，由于小组里别的工人同志的疏忽，机械打中了他的胸部，三根肋骨受了伤。于是，他马上被送到医院去治疗。
    陈启荣身体坚强结实，治疗不几天，伤势逐渐好转了。他是个闲不住的人，人虽然还躺在病床上，心却早到大高炉上去了；不等身体复原，他就急着要出院。每当有人去探望他，他就着急地打听高炉工程的进度。同志们都知道他的脾气，只好对他说：由于材料不齐，眼前活儿很少，要他继续安心养病。他听了，总是半信半疑，常常一个人爬到病院对面的土丘上，向工地了望。因为离得远，看不清楚，有一天他索性偷偷地走出医院，跑出去看。走出一里多地，隐隐地看见高炉已经起来小半截了。这一下，陈启荣回到医院又一再要求出院。医生不许可。这天，正好队里的工会主席田荣风去看他，他急得跳脚说：“老田，在这里我一天也呆不下去了。大高炉开始安装，人人都在跃进，我不能出力，还要国家花医药费，这不成了废物……”在他再三要求下，医生只得同意他出院，但是嘱咐他回工地不能多干体力活，要多休息。可是，回到工地，他就忘了，跟着大家一样劳动，别人拦也拦不住。
    苦思合理化建议
    今年5月里，高炉设备安装工程进入紧张的阶段。斜桥安装好了，下一步要安装主卷扬机。这时包钢党委发出了力争一号高炉提前出铁的号召。这号召像一根火把，把一万多名高炉建设者的热情燃得更加旺盛了。所有施工队伍、各个工种的工人，都投入了紧张的劳动。工程进度不断地向前跃进。炼铁区指挥部要求当时的重点——主卷扬机机座和卷筒安装，在十天内完成。这个艰巨的任务就落在架工们的身上。而当时摆在架工们面前的困难不少：吊装工具抱子小，自重才十五吨，而卷筒重二十吨、机座重十八吨，起吊不安全；要是加固抱子，又太费时间，工期就得往后拖，十天里不可能完成任务。这样的困难，怎么解决？队里的人都为这事发愁。有一天，陈启荣在工地吃了晚饭，没有回家，一个人跑到现场去，在高炉面前来回转，观察地形，思索吊装的办法。
    这时，高炉的炉体已经安装好了，它那高达七十多米的钢铁身躯，像个披盔戴甲的巨人站立在工地中央，在星光下背衬着隐隐的乌拉山，显得十分雄伟壮观。那些高大的热风炉、洗涤塔、除尘器也都巍然耸立在高炉的周围。工地上灯火通明，到处在闪烁着电焊的火光。站在高炉脚下的陈启荣，这时不禁感慨万端：只不过一年的时间，草原上大大变样了，这世界第一流的大高炉眼看就要流出铁水，这真是个大跃进啊！他还记得，解放以前，日本帝国主义者建一座不大的高炉，要用两三年的时间；解放以后，在恢复时期的鞍山和以后在本溪，他也参加安装过几座高炉，那时候他就觉得一座比一座大，一座比一座新，心里高兴得不行。但是，拿它们和现在这座大高炉来比，又差得多了。他还想起党委提出的力争提前出铁的号召，想起平时党支部书记对自己的谈话：“在内蒙古提前建成这样一座高炉，是件了不起的事情。我们在跃进，我们的跃进是不能停的……。”
    “我是共产党员，一定要克服任何困难，让高炉早流铁水！”陈启荣这样下定了决心。
    天墨黑了，暮春的夜晚还略带寒意，陈启荣一个人在高炉下想着吊装的办法，计算着工具、设备的重量和负荷。不知不觉地过了十一点钟，老架工干脆不回家了，跑到休息棚里继续考虑他的合理化建议。第二天一早，他就把自己所想的办法向队领导上提出来，建议在抱子的北面多加一根铧子，南边再立一台链式起重机。这样，抱子不用加固，也能够安全地进行吊装。这个办法经过队领导和小组里工人们的研究、补充，最后被采纳了。施工上的难题终于得到解决。结果十天工期，六天就完成了。
    高炉流出了铁水
    高炉的建设者们，在施工当中就像这样遇到一个又一个的困难，他们也从克服困难当中不断地取得胜利。到8月里，高炉的安装工程只剩下炉顶设备的安装了。陈启荣和小组里的工人们积极响应党委提出的“确保九月出铁，迎接建国十周年，向毛主席献礼”的新的战斗号召，把安装进度排成了日时计划，按日按小时执行和检查工作。在那些日子里，陈启荣很少离开炉顶一步。当他疲倦了的时候，别人劝他和小组的同志们好好注意休息，他们总是回答：高炉提前出铁是大事，等见了铁水再休息也不迟。这最后的一仗一定要打好！
    最后的一仗是炉顶的两个大盖平衡杆的吊装工程。陈启荣在这一仗里，又大显身手。那平衡杆有三米长，重三、四千公斤；要把它吊装到炉顶，抱子吊不上，塔式起重机又不够长，进不去。这又是个难题。这时有些青年工人都眼望陈启荣，希望他出主意。陈启荣果然沉得住气，反复琢磨，提出了一个“步步登高”的办法：在煤气放散管平台下加一根立柱，在平台上安一台链式起重机，先用塔式起重机把平衡杆吊上平台去，然后再用链式起重机接运上去。这个办法确实有效，结果他们提前两天完成了任务。当时，看见陈启荣指挥吊装这项工程的人，无不称赞架工们的办法奇妙。
    高炉安装工程很快地结束了。不久，这座大高炉在9月26日流出了第一炉铁水。老架工陈启荣到北京参加“群英会”的前夕，激动地说：“一号高炉能够提前出铁，主要是由于党的正确领导，有党的总路线的指导和大家的干劲。我们绝不骄傲，一定要在党的领导下，继续大跃进，保证二号高炉建设得更快更好，把内蒙古建设得更美丽！”　（胡木）
