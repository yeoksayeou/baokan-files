Grasp Quality, Emphasize Safety
Anshan Iron and Steel's Small Rolling Mill Wins Overall "More, Faster, Better, and More Economical" Success
Before August, this factory often exceeded the state plan for output and cost. Starting in September, the leadership further emphasized quality and safety, mobilized the masses, and found solutions. Quality quickly caught up, and safety work was greatly strengthened.

(Our newspaper, Anshan, 13th) The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's Small Rolling Mill, after a series of efforts, have achieved an all-round victory of "more, faster, better, and more economical." In October, the factory not only overfulfilled the monthly state plan for steel output and cost but also exceeded the steel qualification rate by 1.59% of the plan. It also eliminated major accidents in safety, winning the red flag award for overall success from Anshan Iron and Steel. In early November, the factory reached a new peak of "more, faster, better, and more economical," with steel output exceeding 5.4%, the steel qualification rate exceeding the plan by 1.44%, and the task of reducing product costs by 726,000 yuan for the whole year already completed ahead of schedule, and accidents are becoming fewer and fewer.

In the Great Leap Forward last year, Anshan Iron and Steel's Small Rolling Mill comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan for output, quality, cost, and other indicators. Since the beginning of this year, due to some cadres developing right-leaning, lax sentiments, the factory's output and costs have been overfulfilling the state plan almost every month, but steel quality, except for May, did not meet the quality targets from January to August, and safety accidents also increased. Therefore, in the third-quarter inter-factory competition evaluation of Anshan Iron and Steel, this factory was not rated as a red flag.

Based on the comprehensive requirements of the state for high output, high quality, low cost, and safe production, the factory's Party committee first focused on improving the two varieties with the worst quality, rebar and rivet steel, and then drove the improvement of the quality of other varieties. The factory Party committee's in-depth inspection revealed that the main reason why rebar and rivet steel had not met national quality standards for a long time was that some people held right-leaning sentiments, believing that "the equipment is old, and product quality cannot be required to be too high," and many measures and systems to ensure quality were not seriously implemented. Therefore, the factory Party committee immediately mobilized the workers and masses, on the one hand, to criticize this right-leaning and discouraged view, and on the other hand, to find ways and tricks, and implemented a series of improvement measures such as batch loading of raw materials and temperature control. The quality barrier of the two products was quickly broken through. The first-grade rate of rebar was 8% to 9% lower than the plan in July and August, but in September it jumped to exceed the plan by more than 10%, and in October it increased by 3.9% compared to September; the qualification rate of rivet steel also reached the prescribed standards. Subsequently, those steels that were originally of poor quality also quickly caught up, and overfulfilled the national quality plan in September and October.

In terms of safe production, the factory conducted two major safety inspections in the first half of the year and also took some safety measures, but because ideological education on safe production was not strengthened for the workers, some safety measures and systems were put aside, so safety accidents still occurred frequently. Based on the electric shock accident that occurred on August 1, the factory Party committee mobilized the masses to conduct a large-scale airing of views, a large-scale debate, analyzed the causes, looked for solutions, and criticized the idea of neglecting safe production, which gave the workers a profound safety ideological education. At the same time, the Party committee secretary and the factory director personally led the workers and masses in conducting a major safety inspection, taking various measures, solving ninety-two major safety key issues, and plugging the loopholes that caused accidents. At the same time, permanent safety systems were established and improved in the production teams. In this way, the factory's safety work was greatly strengthened, eliminating all major accidents.

At present, this factory is advancing victoriously, determined to achieve high output, high quality, low cost, and safe production every month in the fourth quarter.

    抓紧质量　重视安全
    鞍钢小型轧钢厂赢得多快好省满堂红
    八月份以前，这个厂的产量和成本经常超额完成国家计划。从九月开始，领导进一步抓紧了质量和安全，发动了群众，找到了办法，质量迅速赶上来了，安全工作也大大加强了。
    本报鞍山13日电　鞍钢小型轧钢厂职工们经过一系列的努力，取得了多快好省的全面胜利。10月份这个厂不仅钢材产量、成本超额完成了全月国家计划，而且钢材合格率超过计划1.59％，安全方面也消灭了重大事故，获得鞍钢全面满堂红的红旗奖励。11月上旬，这个厂又登上多快好省的新高峰，钢材产量超过5.4％，钢材合格率超过计划1.44％，全年降低产品成本七十二万六千元的任务，已经提前完成，事故也越来越少。
    鞍钢小型轧钢厂在去年大跃进中，产量、质量、成本等指标都全面超额完成了国家计划。今年以来，由于某些干部滋长了右倾松劲情绪，全厂产量、成本差不多月月都超额完成了国家计划，但是钢材质量除5月份外，1月到8月都没有达到质量指标，安全事故也增多了。因此，在第三季度鞍钢厂际竞赛评比中，这个厂没有被评上红旗。
    根据国家高产、优质、低成本和安全生产的全面要求，这个工厂党委首先抓住螺纹钢和铆钉钢两种质量最差的品种，积极加以改进，然后再带动提高其他品种的质量。厂党委深入检查的结果，发现螺纹钢和铆钉钢长期没有达到国家质量指标的主要原因，是有些人认为“设备老，产品质量不能要求过高”的右倾情绪，好多保证质量的措施和制度没有认真贯彻。于是，工厂党委马上发动职工群众，一面批驳这种右倾泄气的论调，一面想办法、找窍门，实行了原料分批装炉、控制温度等一系列改进措施，两种产品的质量关很快被突破。螺纹钢的一级品率，7、8月份比计划差8％到9％，9月份一跃比计划超过10％，10月又比9月提高3.9％；铆钉钢的合格率，也达到了规定的标准。随后，那些原来质量较差的钢材，也迅速赶了上来，9、10月份都超额完成了国家质量计划。
    在安全生产方面，这个厂在上半年进行过两次安全大检查，也采取了一些安全措施，但是由于对职工没有加强安全生产的思想教育，有些安全措施和制度搁置一边，因而安全事故依然时常发生。工厂党委根据8月1日发生的触电事故，发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，分析原因，寻找解决办法，批判忽视安全生产的思想，使职工受到一次深刻的安全思想教育。同时，党委书记、厂长亲自带头跟职工群众一道进行安全大检查，采取各项措施，解决了九十二件重大安全关键，堵塞了发生事故的漏洞。同时，还在各生产班组建立和健全了经常性的安全制度。这样，全厂安全工作便大大加强，消灭了一切重大事故。
    目前，这个厂正在乘胜前进，决心第四季度月月达到高产、优质、低成本和安全生产。
