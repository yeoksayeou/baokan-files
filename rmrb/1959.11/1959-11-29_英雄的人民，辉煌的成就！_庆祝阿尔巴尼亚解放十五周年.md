    Heroic People, Brilliant Achievements!
    —Celebrating the 15th Anniversary of the Liberation of Albania
    Today is the fifteenth anniversary of the glorious liberation of our fraternal Albanian people. The Chinese people and the people of all countries in the socialist camp, together with all freedom- and independence-loving, peace-loving people of the world, celebrate this glorious festival and warmly congratulate the Albanian people on their brilliant achievements in creating a new life over the past fifteen years.
    Albania's long history is an epic full of the heroic struggle of the people against foreign invaders and domestic ruling classes for freedom and independence. Whether during the four hundred and fifty years of Turkish rule, or during the occupation of Italian and German fascists, the heroic Albanian people stood proudly in the storm, like the lofty mountains of their motherland. The Albanian people waged an indomitable and heroic struggle for the freedom and independence of their motherland and endured terrible disasters and sacrifices. However, all these sacrifices were not in vain. Fifteen years ago today, under the leadership of the glorious Albanian Communist Party (now the Party of Labour), and under the conditions of the decisive victory of the powerful Soviet army over the fascist German army, the Albanian people finally drove out the fascist invaders and liberated their motherland. Since then, a glorious banner of peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism has been raised over this heroic country on the Adriatic coast, on an important war base of imperialism in the Balkan Peninsula.
    After liberation, the Albanian people faced enormous difficulties. Albania was originally one of the most backward countries in Europe. Before World War II, it had almost no industry, its agriculture was extremely backward, and 80% of the population was illiterate; the war caused severe damage to the country. Not only that, but its international environment was also very bad. Imperialism and foreign reactionary forces were constantly trying to undermine Albania's freedom and independence and to put the Albanian people back under the yoke of slavery. However, the heroic Albanian people with their rich revolutionary traditions have never bowed their heads in the face of difficulties and sinister environments. They put forward the bold fighting slogan of "one hand holding a pickaxe, the other hand holding a gun." Under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour, they defended the freedom and independence of their motherland while carrying out socialist construction. In just fifteen years, they have brought about earth-shaking changes in their motherland. The Chinese people express their heartfelt admiration for the heroic spirit of the fraternal Albanian people, who are not afraid of difficulties and not afraid of violence!
    For fifteen years, the Albanian people, under the shining light of their guiding star—the Party, have created a new socialist life with their own laboring hands, and have achieved great successes. Today, Albania has leaped from a backward agricultural country to an agricultural-industrial country. In 1959, Albania's total industrial output value increased by about twenty-one times compared to 1938. For example, Albania's chromium ore production has exceeded that of all its neighboring countries, ranking sixth in the world (and first in the world in terms of per capita); its oil production per capita has exceeded that of Italy, Turkey, and Yugoslavia; and its coal and iron production has also exceeded that of Italy, Greece, Turkey, and other countries. The development of agriculture is also rapid, with grain output more than doubling compared to pre-liberation levels; cotton output has increased one hundred and twenty-three times. In the past, the only tool used by the vast number of farmers was the wooden plow. Today, 70% of the main agricultural production processes in the country have been mechanized. The cultivated area of cooperative agriculture has accounted for 81.5% of the country's total cultivated area. With the surge of the national economy, the cultural and material lives of the Albanian people have also taken on a new look. Today, illiteracy among those under forty years old has long been eliminated in Albania, and socialist intellectuals are constantly growing; the living standards of the broad masses of people are steadily rising. The Albanian revolutionary poet Migjani once passionately sang: "Let the strings of the seven-stringed lyre play a new era... All ethnic groups around sing of their golden age." Today, this beautiful dream of the Albanian people has become a reality, and the "golden age" in Albanian history has appeared!
    The victorious path taken by the Albanian people over the past fifteen years has once again eloquently demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system to the people of the world. The victory of the Albanian people shows that no matter how small a country is, no matter how backward a country is, as long as the people hold power, grasp the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism, and have the correct leadership of the proletarian party, it will surely achieve leapfrog development and will surely be invincible.
    Now, the Albanian people are advancing victoriously. A huge upsurge of socialist economic and cultural construction is surging all over Albania. The Albanian Party of Labour is formulating the third five-year plan for the development of the national economy (1961-1965). After the completion of this plan, Albania will be transformed from its current state of an agricultural-industrial country into an industrial-agricultural country. During the third five-year plan, not only will the existing industrial sectors have great development, but new industrial enterprises such as chemical and metallurgical industries will also be established; agriculture will also have further development. The Chinese people firmly believe that under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour, with the efforts of the Albanian people, and with the support of the people of socialist countries, the Albanian people will surely build a splendid socialist garden on the Adriatic coast!
    Heroic Albania stands on the southwest frontier of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, bravely and fearlessly defending the cause of peace and socialism. The People's Republic of Albania, like all countries in the socialist camp, has consistently pursued a foreign policy of peace and has made outstanding contributions to the cause of defending European and world peace and strengthening international friendly cooperation. Today, the People's Republic of Albania has established diplomatic relations with twenty-three countries; its just voice can be heard in many international organizations. The People's Republic of Albania actively supports the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for freedom and independence, and resolutely opposes the aggressive and war policies of US imperialism. The People's Republic of Albania resolutely opposes the establishment of atomic weapons and rocket bases by US imperialism in Greece and Italy, and actively supports the convening of a summit conference of Balkan countries to make the Balkan Peninsula and the Adriatic Sea region a region without atomic weapons and without rocket weapons. Today, the People's Republic of Albania has become an important force in maintaining peace in the Balkan Peninsula and the Adriatic Sea region.
    All these great achievements that Albania has achieved today should first of all be attributed to the correct leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour. The Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, has consistently been loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and has achieved major victories in the struggle to unite the Albanian people in carrying out socialist construction. In order to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism and to consolidate the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement, the Albanian Party and the working people have waged a resolute struggle against modern Yugoslav revisionism and have made valuable contributions.
    Although China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, the great thought of Marxism-Leninism and the common belief in building socialism and defending world peace have forged an unbreakable fraternal friendship between the two peoples. Over the past decade, political, economic, and cultural relations between the two countries have continued to develop; our fraternal friendship has become increasingly profound and consolidated. Today, China, Albania, and other socialist countries have formed a strong alliance headed by the Soviet Union. Any conspiracy by imperialism to undermine the unity of the socialist camp and to undermine the freedom and independence of any socialist country is doomed to shameful failure. The Chinese people firmly support the Albanian people's cause of socialist construction and their struggle to defend the freedom and independence of their motherland; and we sincerely thank the Albanian people for their active support for our people's cause of socialist construction and our struggle against US imperialism's occupation of our territory Taiwan and the coastal islands.
    Since ancient times, the Albanian people have proudly called their motherland the "Land of the Eagles." Today, we are pleased to see how freely and vigorously the Albanian eagle soars in the great socialist era! On this glorious festival, the Chinese people would like to extend the warmest congratulations and heartfelt respect to the people of the heroic "Land of the Eagles"—our close brothers!
    We wish our Albanian brothers even more brilliant achievements in building socialism!
    We wish the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples to last as long as the mountains and rivers!
    We wish the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union to be as solid as steel!

    英雄的人民，辉煌的成就！
    ——庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放十五周年
    今天是我们光荣的兄弟阿尔巴尼亚人民解放的十五周年。中国人民和社会主义阵营各国人民，以及全世界向往自由独立、爱好和平的人民一起，欢庆这个光辉的节日，热烈祝贺阿尔巴尼亚人民十五年来创造新生活的辉煌成就。
    阿尔巴尼亚悠久的历史，是一部充满人民反对外国侵略者和国内统治阶级、争取自由和独立的斗争的英雄史诗。无论在长达四百五十年之久的土耳其的统治时期，或是在意大利和德国法西斯的占领时期，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民都像祖国崇高的群山一样，在暴风雨中傲然屹立。阿尔巴尼亚人民为争取祖国的自由和独立进行了不屈不挠的英勇斗争，经受了惨重的灾难和牺牲。然而，这一切的代价并不是白费的。十五年前的今天，在光荣的阿尔巴尼亚共产党（现在的劳动党）的领导下，在强大的苏联军队对法西斯德军取得决定性胜利的条件下，阿尔巴尼亚人民终于赶走了法西斯侵略者，解放了自己的祖国。从此，在亚得里亚海滨这个英雄国家的上空，在帝国主义在巴尔干半岛的一个重要战争基地上，升起了一面和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义的光辉旗帜。
    解放后，阿尔巴尼亚人民面临着巨大的困难。阿尔巴尼亚本来是欧洲最落后的国家之一，在第二次世界大战之前，工业几乎一无所有，农业也极端落后，全国80％的人口都是文盲；而战争又使这个国家遭到严重的破坏。不仅这样，它的国际环境也十分恶劣，帝国主义和外国反动势力时刻企图破坏阿尔巴尼亚的自由和独立，把阿尔巴尼亚人民重新置于奴役的枷锁下。但是，英雄的富有革命传统的阿尔巴尼亚人民，从来没有在困难和险恶的环境面前低过头。他们提出了“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”的豪迈的战斗口号，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，一面保卫祖国的自由和独立，一面进行社会主义建设；在短短的十五年间，使祖国起了翻天复地的变化。中国人民对于兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民不畏困难、不畏强暴的英雄气概表示衷心的敬佩！
    十五年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民，在自己的引路明灯——党的光辉照耀下，用自己劳动的双手，创造着社会主义的新生活，已经取得了伟大的成就。今天，阿尔巴尼亚已经从一个落后的农业国跃为一个农业—工业国。1959年阿尔巴尼亚的工业总产值约比1938年增加二十一倍。例如，阿尔巴尼亚的铬矿石产量已超过了所有的邻国，居世界第六位（按人口平均计算则居世界第一位）；石油产量按人口平均计算已超过了意大利、土耳其、南斯拉夫；煤和铁的产量也超过了意大利、希腊和土耳其等国。农业的发展也是迅速的，粮食产量比解放前增加了一倍多；棉花产量增加了一百二十三倍。过去广大农民使用的唯一工具是木犁，今天全国70％的主要农业生产过程都已机械化。合作化农业的耕地面积已占全国耕地总面积的81.5％。随着国民经济的高涨，阿尔巴尼亚人民的文化和物质生活面貌也焕然一新。今天，在阿尔巴尼亚，四十岁以下的文盲早已消灭，社会主义的知识分子不断成长；广大人民的生活水平蒸蒸日上。阿尔巴尼亚的革命诗人米吉安尼曾经热情地歌唱过：“让七弦琴的琴弦弹奏新的时代……各族人民在四周歌唱自己的黄金时代。”今天，阿尔巴尼亚人民的这个美丽的梦想已经变成现实，阿尔巴尼亚历史上的“黄金时代”已经出现了！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民十五年来所走过的胜利道路，在全世界人民面前再一次雄辩地证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。阿尔巴尼亚人民的胜利说明了：不论一个国家多小，不论一个国家多么落后，只要人民掌握了政权，掌握了马克思列宁主义的思想武器，有了无产阶级政党的正确领导，它就一定会获得飞跃的发展，一定会无往而不胜利。
    现在，阿尔巴尼亚人民正在乘胜前进。阿尔巴尼亚全国各地到处洋溢着巨大的社会主义经济和文化建设热潮。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党正在制定发展国民经济的第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）。这个计划完成后，阿尔巴尼亚将由现在的农业—工业国变为工业—农业国。在第三个五年计划期间，已有的工业部门不但将有很大的发展，还将建立起化学、冶金等新的工业企业；农业也将有进一步的发展。中国人民深信，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，在阿尔巴尼亚人民的努力下，在社会主义各国人民的支持下，阿尔巴尼亚人民一定会在亚得里亚海滨建设起一座灿烂夺目的社会主义大花园！
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚屹立在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的西南前哨，英勇无畏地捍卫着和平和社会主义事业。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国和社会主义阵营各国一样，一贯奉行和平外交政策，在保卫欧洲和世界和平、加强国际友好合作的事业中作出了卓越的贡献。今天，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国已同二十三个国家建立了外交关系；在许多国际组织中都可以听到它的正义的声音。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国积极支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民争取自由和独立的斗争，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国坚决反对美帝国主义在希腊和意大利建立原子武器和火箭基地，积极支持召开巴尔干各国首脑会议，以使巴尔干半岛和亚得里亚海地区成为无原子武器和无火箭武器的地区。今天，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国已成为维护巴尔干半岛和亚得里亚海地区和平的重要力量。
    阿尔巴尼亚今天所取得的这一切巨大的成就，应当首先归功于阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导。以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会，一贯忠实于马克思列宁主义原则，在团结阿尔巴尼亚全国人民进行社会主义建设的斗争中取得了重大的胜利。阿尔巴尼亚党和劳动人民为了捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，为了巩固社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结，对南斯拉夫现代修正主义进行了坚决的斗争，并且作出了宝贵的贡献。
    中国和阿尔巴尼亚两国虽然遥隔千山万水，但是马克思列宁主义的伟大思想和建设社会主义、保卫世界和平的共同信念，使两国人民结成了牢不可破的兄弟友谊。十年来，两国之间政治、经济和文化等关系不断发展；我们的兄弟友谊日益深厚，日益巩固。今天，中国、阿尔巴尼亚和其他社会主义国家一起结成了以苏联为首的强大联盟。帝国主义任何破坏社会主义阵营团结和破坏任何一个社会主义国家的自由独立的阴谋，都注定要遭到可耻的失败。中国人民坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚人民的社会主义建设事业和捍卫祖国自由和独立的斗争；并且衷心感谢阿尔巴尼亚人民对我国人民的社会主义建设事业和反对美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾和沿海岛屿的斗争的积极支持。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民自古以来就骄傲地把自己的祖国称为“鹰之国”。今天，我们高兴地看到，阿尔巴尼亚之鹰，在伟大的社会主义时代里，多么自由而矫健地翱翔！在这光辉的节日里，中国人民谨向英雄的“鹰之国”的人民——我们亲密的兄弟致以最热烈的祝贺和衷心的敬意！
    祝阿尔巴尼亚兄弟们建设社会主义的成就更加辉煌！
    祝中国和阿尔巴尼亚两国人民的兄弟友谊山高水长！
    祝以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结如铁似钢！
