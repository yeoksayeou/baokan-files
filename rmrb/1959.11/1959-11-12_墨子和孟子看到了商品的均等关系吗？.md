A Study Note:

    Did Mozi and Mencius See the Equal Relationship of Commodities?
    Da Ke

    Some time ago, I saw an article in the New Hunan Daily entitled "Who Was the First to Discover That Commodity Exchange Must Be of Equal Value?" (August 3, 1959). That article argued that Mozi (c. 428-376 BC) and Mencius (c. 372-289 BC) were much more advanced than Aristotle (384-322 BC) in their understanding of the principle that commodity exchange must be of equal value. Therefore, "the law that commodity exchange must be equal exchange was first discovered in China." The arguments were based on two sources: the "Mo Jing" (Mohist Canon) and "Mencius." At the time, I had doubts about this argument and wanted to explore it. However, I had to put it aside due to other matters. Recently, I had the opportunity to check some books and found that the argument in that article was untenable.

    To explain this issue, it is necessary to first examine Aristotle's analysis of exchange. In his book "Politics," Aristotle said: "Every object has a dual use—one is inherent to the object itself, and the other is not. For example, sandals can be worn, and they can also be used for exchange. Both are uses of sandals." Here, Aristotle clearly distinguished between use value and exchange value for the first time. In particular, in his book "Nicomachean Ethics," Aristotle said that in the process of commodity exchange, "one person's product can certainly be better than another person's product; therefore, they must be made equal. ... All things that are exchanged must be comparable in some way. Money is used for this purpose." These words of Aristotle are of great scientific significance. According to his analysis, the things being exchanged are actually unequal; unequal things must be reduced to equal in exchange. Marx gave high praise to Aristotle's thought in "Das Kapital." He said: "The brilliance of Aristotle's genius lies in his discovery in the expression of value of commodities a relation of equality."

    Now, let's look at the words quoted from the "Mo Jing" and "Mencius" in the New Hunan Daily article.

    First, the "Mo Jing." According to research, the "Mo Jing" was not written by Mozi himself but by later followers of the Mohist school. Its writing was completed around the end of the Warring States period, around 200 BC. Therefore, it is not appropriate to prove Mozi's thoughts based solely on the "Mo Jing." Leaving that aside, the New Hunan Daily article's interpretation of the "Mo Jing" is also questionable. The New Hunan Daily article believes that the "Mo Jing" contains: "Buying is not expensive, the explanation lies in reverting to its price." "Buying: knives and grains are exchanged as commodities. If knives are cheap, then grain will not be expensive. If knives are expensive, then grain will not be easily exchanged." Therefore, "Mozi saw the equal relationship of value in commodity exchange." This is a misunderstanding of the "Mo Jing." In fact, the original meaning of the first passage in the "Mo Jing" is: "There is no such thing as an expensive price. An expensive price means that the value of currency is low; looking at the value of currency in reverse from the price of goods, knowing that the value of currency is low, we know that the price of goods is not expensive." The original meaning of the second passage is: "Currency and grain are traded. If people devalue currency, then they will not think that the price of grain is expensive even if it is high; if people value currency, then they will not think that the price of grain is cheap even if it is low." Obviously, what the "Mo Jing" says is only the relationship of mutual increase and decrease between commodity prices and currency value, that is, the proportional relationship between commodities and money. The New Hunan Daily article also believes that the "Mo Jing" contains: "If the price is suitable, then it can be sold. The explanation lies in exhausting it." "Selling, exhausting means to remove what prevents it from being sold. If what prevents it from being sold is removed, then it can be sold..." Therefore, Mozi once again "discovered the equal exchange relationship in commodity exchange." This is also an inappropriate analogy. In fact, the original meaning of the first passage in the "Mo Jing" is: "As long as the price is appropriate, it can be sold. What is appropriate means to remove the reason why it cannot be sold." The original meaning of the second passage is: "The exhaustion mentioned above refers to removing the reason why it cannot be sold. As long as the reason why it cannot be sold is removed, it can be sold." The "Mo Jing" then goes on to say: "Whether the price is appropriate depends on whether the buyer needs it." (Main idea) Similarly, what the "Mo Jing" discusses is still only the monetary form of commodities, which is also very clear.

    Let's look at "Mencius." The New Hunan Daily article believes even more that Mencius, in the "Xu Xing Chapter," "not only recognized the difference between the use value and value of goods, but also had a further and clearer understanding of the principle that commodity exchange must be equal exchange." This is especially an inappropriate extension. The original text of that passage in the "Xu Xing Chapter" is as follows: "The inequality of things is the nature of things. Some are doubled or quintupled, some are tenfold or hundredfold, some are ten-thousandfold or millionfold. If you compare them and make them the same, you will disrupt the world. If large shoes and small shoes are sold at the same price, would people do it?" The New Hunan Daily article says that Mencius's "inequality of things" "points out that the use values of things are different." Therefore, Mencius "believed that the use value of things cannot be compared and cannot be equal" and "believed that commodity exchange must be equal exchange." In fact, that passage in the "Xu Xing Chapter" is addressed to Xu Xing's ideas. Only by understanding Xu Xing's ideas can we understand the original meaning of that passage. Xu Xing's idea was: "The things sold in the market are all priced according to length, weight, quantity, and size, regardless of whether they are refined or coarse, beautiful or ugly." Therefore, what Mencius is referring to here is only that things have different degrees of refinement and cannot be priced the same. Mencius neither distinguished between use value and exchange value nor proposed the concept of the equality of commodities.

    Of course, Mozi and Mencius are both great thinkers in ancient China, and their thoughts deserve our realistic and serious study. Furthermore, the "Mo Jing" recognizes the proportional relationship between commodities and money, and the "Mencius" recognizes that different degrees of refinement lead to different exchange values. However, this does not mean that they recognized the equal relationship of commodities, and the two cannot be confused. Since people's understanding of things always goes from shallow to deep, people's understanding of exchange relationships also has different stages. That is to say, the development of the division of labor inevitably leads to the development of commodity circulation and the emergence of money. In exchange, people cannot help but see that the exchange values of various commodities are different, and they cannot help but see the changes in prices. Therefore, this phenomenon cannot help but first arouse their thoughts. However, at first, people did not investigate why this phenomenon occurred. Regarding this point, Marx said in "Das Kapital": People usually "see in the value relation merely the proportion, in which the two commodities are exchangeable in definite quantities. They overlook the fact, that the magnitudes of different things can be quantitatively compared, only when reduced to the same unit." When people realized the equal relationship of commodities in exchange, this marked a new stage in people's understanding of exchange relationships. Aristotle made great contributions in this area.

    In short, neither in the "Mo Jing" nor in the "Mencius" is there a deeper analysis of the nature of exchange, that is, neither has seen the equal relationship of commodities in exchange. If we say that, in the process of people's understanding of exchange relationships, recognizing that commodities have different exchange values and the proportional relationship between commodities and money is the first stage, and recognizing the equal relationship of commodities is the second stage, then we can say that the understanding in the "Mo Jing" and "Mencius" is in the first stage, while Aristotle's understanding is in the second stage. However, even Aristotle, due to historical limitations, did not further discover what the "reality" of the equal relationship in commodity exchange is (Marx, "Das Kapital"). When people realized the essence of this equal relationship, that is, the equality of commodities depends on labor, this marked that people's understanding of exchange relationships had entered an even higher stage.

### 墨子和孟子看到了商品的均等关系吗？

    墨子和孟子看到了商品的均等关系吗？
    大可
    前些时候，我在新湖南报上看到一篇“最早发现商品交换必须价值相等的是谁？”（1959年8月3日）的文章。那篇文章认为，墨子（约公元前428—376年）和孟子（约公元前372—289年）对商品交换必须等价这一原理的认识，都比亚里士多德（公元前384—322年）大大地前进了一步。因此，“商品交换必须等价交换这一规律性，是中国最早发现的”。其论据有二，一是“墨经”，一是“孟子”。当时，我对这个论点即有疑惑，很想探究一下。但是，后来因有别的事情，只得搁了下来。最近，我有机会查了一些书，发现那篇文章的论点实在站不住脚。
    为了要说明这个问题，我们有必要首先考察一下亚里士多德关于交换的分析。亚里士多德在“政治论”一书中说：“每一种物的用途，都是二重的。——其一是物自身所有的，其一不是物自身所有的。好像草鞋，它可以穿，又可以用来交换。二者都是草鞋的用途。”在这里，亚里士多德第一次明确地提出了使用价值和交换价值的区别。特别是亚里士多德在“伦理学”一书中说：在商品交换的过程中，“一个人的制作品当然可以比别一个人的更好，因此，必须使它们成为平等的。……互相交换的一切物，必须成为可以依某种方法互相比较的。货币就是为了这个目的而采用的。”亚里士多德的这些话是有着重大的科学意义的。根据他的分析，相交换的诸物，其实是不等的；诸不等物，在交换上必须还原为均等的。对于亚里士多德这种思想，马克思在“资本论”中给予了极高的评价。他说：“亚里士多德能在商品的价值表现中发现一种均等关系，这是他的天才的闪耀”。
    现在，我们来看看新湖南报的文章所引用的“墨经”和“孟子”中的话。
    先看“墨经”。据考证，“墨经”不是墨子自著，而是出于墨家后学之手，其写定的年代约在战国末期，即纪元前二百多年。因此，仅凭“墨经”来证明墨子的思想，这是不妥当的。姑且不谈这一点，新湖南报的文章对“墨经”的解释也很值得商榷。新湖南报的文章认为“墨经”中有：“买无贵，说在仮其价。”“买：刀籴相为贾，刀轻则籴不贵，刀重则籴不易。”因此，“墨子看到了商品交换中价值的同等关系。”这是对“墨经”的一种误解。其实，“墨经”中前一段话的原意是：“物价是无所谓贵的。物价贵就是币价贱；就物价反过来看币价，知道币价贱了，就知道物价是不贵的。”后一段话的原意是：“货币和谷物相交易。人轻货币，那末谷价虽高也不以为贵；人重货币，那末谷价虽低也不以为贱。”显然，“墨经”中所说的只是物价和币值互为消长的关系，即商品和货币的比例关系。新湖南报的文章又认为“墨经”中有：“贾宜则仇，说在尽。”“贾，尽也者，尽去其所以不仇也。其所以不仇去，则仇……”因此，墨子又一次地“发现了商品交换中的等价交换关系”。这也是一种引喻失义的说法。其实，“墨经”中前一段话的原意是：“只要物价相宜，就可以卖出去。所谓宜，就是去掉卖不出去的原因。”后一段话的原意是：“上文所说的尽，指的就是去掉所以卖不出去的原因。只要去掉所以卖不出去的原因，就可以卖出去了。”“墨经”中接着还说：“所谓物价是否相宜，在于买者是否需要。”（大意）同样，“墨经”中所论述的还只是商品的货币形式，这也是明显得很的。
    再看“孟子”。新湖南报的文章更认为，孟子在“许行章”中，“不仅已经认识了物品的使用价值与价值的区别，对商品交换必须等价交换的原理，也有了进一步的明确认识”。这尤其是一种不恰当的引伸了。“许行章”中那一段话的原文是这样的：“夫物之不齐，物之情也。或相倍蓰，或相什伯，或相千万。子比而同之，是乱天下也。巨屦小屦同贾，人岂为之哉。”新湖南报的文章说：孟子所谓“物之不齐”是“指出物的使用价值不同”。因此，孟子“认定物之使用价值是不能比较，不能相等的”，并且“认定商品交换必须等价交换”。其实，“许行章”中那一段话是对许行的主张而言的。只要了解到许行的主张，就可以了解到那一段话的本义了。许行的主张是：“市中所鬻之物，皆不论精粗美恶，但以长短轻重多少大小为价。”因此，孟子在这里所指的只是：物有精粗之别，不能同价。孟子是既没有区分使用价值和交换价值，也没有提出商品的均等性这个观念的。
    当然，墨子和孟子都是我国古代伟大的思想家，他们的思想值得我们实事求是地加以认真研究。并且，“墨经”中是认识到商品和货币的比例关系的，“孟子”中是认识到精粗不同而交换价值不同的。但是，这并不等于说他们认识到商品的均等关系，二者是不能混为一谈的。由于人们对事物的认识总是由浅入深的，所以人们对交换关系的认识也有不同的阶段。这就是说，由于分工的发达，必然引起商品流通的发展和货币的出现。人们在交换中不能不看到各种商品的交换价值不同，以及不能不看到价格的变动，于是这种现象就不能不首先引起他们的思索。但是，当初人们并不去追究何以会有这种现象的发生。关于这一点，马克思在“资本论”中说过：人们通常“在价值关系中，只看见两种商品依一定量就可以相等的比例。他们忽略了，不同物的大小在还原为同一单位以前，不能有量的比较。”到了人们认识到交换中商品的均等关系，这就标志着人们对交换关系的认识跨进了一个新的阶段。亚里士多德正是在这一方面作出了巨大的贡献。
    总之，无论是“墨经”中也好，或是“孟子”中也好，都没有更深入地分析交换的性质，即都还没有看到交换中商品的均等关系。如果我们说，在人们对交换关系的认识过程中，认识商品具有不同的交换价值以及商品和货币的比例关系是第一阶段，而认识商品的均等关系是第二阶段，那末我们可以说，“墨经”和“孟子”中的认识是处于第一阶段，而亚里士多德的认识是处于第二阶段。不过，就是亚里士多德，由于历史条件的限制，也没有进一步地发现商品交换中的均等关系的“实在”是什么（马克思：“资本论”）。及至人们认识到这种均等关系的实质，即商品的均等取决于劳动，这就标志着人们对交换关系的认识又跨进一个更高的阶段了。
