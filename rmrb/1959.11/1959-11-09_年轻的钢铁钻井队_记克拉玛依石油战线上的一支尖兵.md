    The Young Steel Drilling Team
    —A Vanguard Force on the Karamay Oil Front
    In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, the Youth Steel Drilling Team of the Karamay Mining Bureau of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration drilled 18,795 meters, fulfilling 308% of the state plan. It also created a new record of drilling 4,873 meters in a winter month and 537 meters per day. In 1959, the Karamay Youth Steel Drilling Team overcame various difficulties in a new struggle and achieved new victories. Entering 1959, they first overcame the severe cold of minus 40 degrees Celsius and won their first major victory, drilling 3,486 meters in January with a peak daily drilling rate of 530 meters. By April 27, they had drilled 10,027 meters, breaking the 10,000-meter mark, exceeding the entire 1958 plan by more than 3,000 meters. This shattered the historical record of failing to meet the plan in the first quarter of previous years, refuted the negative arguments that a leap forward was impossible in winter, and heralded the continuation of the Great Leap Forward in 1959. By October 15, they had drilled a total of 15,011 meters, exceeding the annual production plan two and a half months ahead of schedule.
    The growth of this young Steel Drilling Team is inseparable from the leadership of Sun Yuting, the captain and Party Branch Secretary of the drilling team. Sun Yuting was transferred to Karamay from the army in 1956. After arriving in Karamay, he fell deeply in love with this place. At that time, he was still a novice in drilling work. When he saw the drilling records of many brother drilling teams, especially the experienced Zhang Yunqing drilling team, constantly leaping forward, he organized the drilling team members to learn from the Zhang Yunqing drilling team. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, they further put forward the resounding fighting slogan: "A Great Leap Forward in production, working as hard as Wu Song; drilling all over the Gobi Desert, surpassing Zhang Yunqing." He found that the most prominent advantage of the Zhang Yunqing drilling team was that the political and ideological work was done thoroughly, and the team members were highly motivated. As long as the Party and government leaders in the team called for action, everyone responded actively. Sun Yuting thought that in order to catch up with the Zhang Yunqing drilling team, he must strengthen the political work in the team. Therefore, he conducted in-depth and meticulous education on the General Line for the team members, greatly improving their political awareness, and everyone's enthusiasm became even more vigorous. In the days of catching up with the Zhang Yunqing drilling team, many workers fought tenaciously, and a new situation of one leap after another appeared in production. In July 1958, they drilled 1,551 meters, and in August, it jumped to 2,210 meters. In November, the Zhang Yunqing drilling team supported the petroleum construction in the interior and transferred the drilling rig to the Sun Yuting drilling team. At that time, Sun Yuting and the team members were very excited. Sun Yuting told the leaders that they would never fail the Party's expectations, and would definitely maintain the honor of the Zhang Yunqing drilling team and set the drilling benchmark even higher. In order to strive for greater achievements, the team members never easily let go of a minute or a second in their work. When Zhang Tongwen's team and Han Mingda's team were moving the drilling rig and derrick, there were no lights on the well and no moon in the sky. According to past practices, they had to stop work. However, in order to save time, the team members lit torches to work. Once, in the downhole casing, they encountered a storm. The casing swayed like a pendulum, and rainwater flowed down their helmets into their necks, and the wind made it difficult to open their eyes. Under these harsh climatic conditions, they completed the task of running the casing and cementing, winning more drilling time and creating newer achievements. In November, they drilled a total of 4,525 meters, surpassing the national record of 4,300 meters per month previously created by the Zhang Yunqing drilling team.
    In their work, the Communist Party members of the Young Steel Drilling Team fully demonstrated a spirit of selflessness, setting an example in everything they did. Communist Party member Zhang Tongwen led his team to consistently complete their tasks excellently. Once, during the process of running casing, cement damaged his eyes, making it difficult for him to see clearly. But in order to speed up drilling and save time, he still insisted on working. A touching story occurred during the drilling task for the Baijiantan high-yield oilfield: Communist Party member Li Zengyan, after attending the National Congress of Activists in Socialist Construction in October 1958, went home on the way, got married, and then returned to the mining area without stopping. One day in June this year, Li Zengyan's mother brought his wife to the mining area. Li Zengyan was of course very happy when he found out, but he thought that it was a time when every second counted in creating excellent achievements to dedicate to National Day. Traveling back and forth dozens of kilometers would inevitably delay work, so he rushed back to the mining area, led his mother and his newlywed wife whom he had been separated from for a long time to the prepared dormitory, and without saying much, returned to the drilling team. A day later, he received a call from the office saying that his mother and wife had not eaten for more than a day because they were unfamiliar with the place. Only then did Li Zengyan have to obey the leader's order and go home.
    In this team, cadres and workers were as close as brothers, united as one. Cadres participated in labor, workers participated in management, everyone discussed matters together, and at the Party Committee's command, the entire team went into action. This enabled them to do everything more, faster, better, and more economically, constantly leaping forward. In March this year, in order to break through 3,000 meters, after discussion and research by all the team's staff, it was decided to change the original four shifts to three shifts, concentrating forces to fight. As a result, they completed 3,247 meters for the entire month. In order to improve the core recovery rate and obtain sufficient and reliable geological data, they carried out technical innovation in the absence of coring tools, changing the six-cone coring bit to a three-cone, three-scraper coring bit, increasing the core recovery rate from the original 50% to 100%.

    年轻的钢铁钻井队
    ——记克拉玛依石油战线上的一支尖兵
    新疆石油管理局克拉玛依矿务局青年钢铁钻井队，在大跃进的1958年，钻井一万八千七百九十五米，完成了国家计划的308％，并且创造了冬季月钻四千八百七十三米、日钻五百三十七米的新纪录。1959年，克拉玛依青年钢铁钻井队在新的斗争中，战胜多种困难，又取得了新的胜利。跨进1959年，他们首先战胜了零下四十度严寒，打了第一个大胜仗。1月份钻井三千四百八十六米。日钻进最高达到五百三十米。到4月27日，钻进达到一万零二十七米，突破了万米关，比1958年全年计划还多三千多米，打破了往年第一季度完不成计划的历史，驳倒了冬季不能跃进的消极论调，揭开了1959年继续跃进的序幕。到10月15日止，他们共钻井一万五千零十一米，提前两个半月超额完成了全年的生产计划。
    这个年轻的钢铁钻井队的成长，是和钻井队的队长兼党支部书记孙玉亭的领导分不开的。孙玉亭是1956年由部队转业到克拉玛依的。他来到克拉玛依以后，就深深地爱上了这个地方。那时，对钻井工作，他还是个生手。当他看到许多兄弟钻井队，尤其是有经验的张云清钻井队的钻井纪录不断跃进时，他便组织钻井队员向张云清钻井队学习。在大跃进的1958年，他们进一步提出了：“生产大跃进，干劲赛武松；钻遍戈壁滩，超过张云清”的响亮的战斗口号。他发现张云清钻井队最突出的优点就是政治思想工作做得深入，队员干劲大，只要队里党政领导一号召，人人都积极响应。孙玉亭想，要想迎头赶上张云清钻井队，就必须加强队里的政治工作。于是他结合队里的情况，向队员深入细致地进行了总路线的教育，大大提高了队员的政治觉悟，大家的干劲更加旺盛了。在追赶张云清钻井队的日子里，许多工人都是顽强奋战，生产上就出现了一跃再跃的新局面。1958年7月份钻井一千五百五十一米，8月份跃到二千二百一十米。11月份张云清钻井队支援内地石油建设，把钻机移交给了孙玉亭钻井队。当时，孙玉亭和队员们非常激动，孙玉亭向领导表示说：我们决不辜负党的希望，一定保持张云清钻井队的荣誉，把钻井标杆插得更高。为了争取更大的成绩，队员们在工作中从不轻易放过一分钟，一秒钟。张同文班和韩明达班在搬移钻机和井架时，井上没有灯，天上又没有月亮，按照过去的情况只得停工了。但是队员们为了争取时间，点起了火把工作。有一次，在井下套管中，遇上了狂风暴雨，套管像钟摆一样，左右摇晃，雨水沿着安全帽流进了脖子，眼睛被风刮得睁不开。在这种恶劣的气候下，他们完成了下套管注水泥的任务，争取了更多的钻进时间，并且创造了更新的成绩。11月份共钻井四千五百二十五米，超过了张云清钻井队过去创造的月钻井四千三百米的全国纪录。
    在工作中，青年钢铁钻井队的共产党员充分表现了忘我精神，处处以身作则。共产党员张同文领导全班经常出色地完成任务。有一次，在下套管过程中，水泥弄坏了眼睛，看东西很困难，但他为了加速钻井，争取时间，仍然坚持工作。在完成白碱滩高产油田的钻井任务中，曾发生了一件动人的故事：共产党员李增彦，1958年10月出席全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会之后，顺路回家，结了婚，便马不停蹄地回到矿区。今年6月的一天，李增彦的母亲领着媳妇来到了矿区，李增彦知道后，心里当然很高兴，但他想到正当分秒必争创造优异成绩向国庆节献礼的时候，来回几十公里必然要耽误上班，他便连忙赶回到矿区，把母亲和新婚久别的爱人领到已准备好的宿舍后，话没多说，就回到了井队。一天以后，他接到处里的电话说，他的母亲和爱人因为人生地不熟，一天多没有吃饭，到这时，李增彦才不得不执行领导的命令，回家去了。
    在这个队里，干部与工人亲如兄弟，团结得像一个人，干部参加劳动，工人参加管理，遇事大家商量，党委一声号令，全队人马上阵。这就使得他们能够把一切工作做得又多又快又好又省，不断地跃进。今年3月份，为了突破三千米，经过全队职工讨论研究，确定把原来的四个班改为三个班，集中力量进行战斗，结果全月完成了三千二百四十七米。为了提高岩心收获率，取得充足可靠的地质资料，在取心工具缺乏的情况下，他们进行了技术革新，把六牙轮取心钻头改成了三牙轮、三刮刀取心钻头，使取心收获率由原来的50％提高到100％。
