Editor's Note:

　　In developing pig raising, two production teams of Tangya Commune in Jinhua County obtained different results due to different methods—one team’s pigs developed rapidly with large profits; the other team’s pigs developed slowly with small profits. However, both teams summarized a common experience, that is, raising pigs must use fine breeds. Raising fine breed pigs resulted in high breeding rates, high piglet survival rates, fast fattening, good meat quality, and high selling prices; raising ordinary pigs, despite the large number raised, did not yield as much profit as fine breed pigs.

　　Another important experience of the Caozhai team is not to sit and wait for fine breeds, not to reach out and ask others for fine breeds, but to start breeding fine breeds themselves without hesitation. To this end, they strengthened leadership, expanded pig farms, and specialized in breeding the fine breed "Liangtouwu," achieving great results in one year.

　　Currently, a winter pig raising and manure accumulation campaign is taking shape. Many places have adopted the method of "keeping every sow, selecting after keeping" to expand the source of pigs. This method is practical and should be promoted. Its benefit is that it can quickly and effectively achieve the goal of raising more pigs and accumulating more fertilizer. However, in places where conditions permit, it is also very important to pay attention to selecting and breeding fine breed pigs suitable for local growth while breeding a large number of piglets.

    多养良种猪
    金华县塘雅公社两个生产队在发展养猪事业中，由于方法不同，得到了不同的结果——一个队的猪发展快，收益大；另一个队的猪发展慢，收益小。但是，两个队却总结出一个共同的经验，就是养猪必须选用良种。养的是良种猪，其结果是繁殖率高、猪仔成活率高、育肥快、肉质好、售价高；养的是普通猪，尽管养的数量不少，收益却不如良种猪大。
    曹宅队另一条重要的经验，就是不坐等良种，不伸手向人要良种，而是毫不迟疑地自己动手繁育良种。他们为此加强了领导，扩建了猪场，专门繁殖良种“两头乌”，一年之间，便取得很大的成绩。
    现在，冬季养猪积肥高潮正在形成。许多地方采取了“见母必留，先留后选”的办法来扩大猪源。这个办法是切实的，应当提倡。它的好处是可以迅速有效地达到多养猪多积肥的目的。但是，在有条件的地方，在大量繁殖仔猪的同时，注意选育和繁殖适合当地生长的良种猪，也是十分重要的事情。
