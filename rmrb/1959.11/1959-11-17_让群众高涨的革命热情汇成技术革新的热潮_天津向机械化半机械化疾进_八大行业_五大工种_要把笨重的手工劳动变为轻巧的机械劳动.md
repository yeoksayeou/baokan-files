    Let the masses' soaring revolutionary enthusiasm converge into a hot tide of technological innovation
    Tianjin is rapidly advancing towards mechanization and semi-mechanization
    Eight major industries, five major types of work
    To transform heavy manual labor into light mechanical labor
    (People's Daily, Tianjin, November 16) The technical innovation and technical revolution movement on the industrial front in Tianjin has entered a new stage. The spearhead of the movement in the city's eight major industries, including shoemaking, weaving, sock knitting, glass, paper products, rubber, carpets, and salt, and five major types of work, including foundry workers, crushing workers, porters, forging workers, and packaging workers, has been directed towards mechanization and semi-mechanization. In order to promote a city-wide upsurge in vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a mobilization meeting.
    Since the anti-Rightist campaign, the upswing of energy, and the new high tide of the increase production and practice economy movement on the industrial front in Tianjin, the city's workers have launched technical innovation and technical revolution activities. Mechanization and semi-mechanization have greatly improved. However, there is still great potential, and there is still a large amount of manual labor and heavy labor. In order to enable the city's industrial production to enter 1960 ahead of schedule, to over fulfill this year's plan by a greater margin, and to prepare for next year's great leap forward, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that: it is necessary to guide the masses' soaring revolutionary enthusiasm to technical innovation and technical revolution. From now on, we must launch a city-wide upsurge in vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization, and strive to improve labor productivity.
    From which aspects should we start to vigorously promote mechanization and semi-mechanization? The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has determined to start from the following aspects: First, departments with manual operations should use machines to replace manual work as much as possible, and use electricity as power; second, departments with a higher degree of mechanization should strive to improve technology, take it to a higher level, and develop towards specialization, automation, continuity, combination, and high speed; third, auxiliary departments should use machines to replace heavy physical labor such as pushing, pulling, carrying, lifting, smashing, carrying, swinging, and stirring. Mechanization and semi-mechanization should be realized in the lifting, loading and unloading, and transportation departments, especially the current urgent tasks; fourth, in response to the weak links in production, add some key equipment to balance production capacity. In addition, we must also pay attention to improving technology, adopting new technologies, adjusting labor organization, and carrying out appropriate production reorganization, which are also important aspects of improving labor productivity. Due to different characteristics of each industry, there should also be different priorities when vigorously promoting mechanization.
    In terms of the methods of vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to implement the "walking on two legs" policy, combining foreign methods with indigenous methods, combining large and small-scale methods, and according to needs and possibilities, using foreign methods where possible, and using indigenous methods where foreign methods are not possible, or engaging in some simple equipment combining indigenous and foreign methods, so as to achieve gradual improvement from indigenous to foreign methods. At the same time, it is necessary to implement the policy of large, medium, and small-scale methods, not only to engage in some large-scale equipment, but also to pay attention to engaging in some small-scale equipment, to transform small into large, and to combine national investment with self-reliance, with self-reliance as the main focus, fully mobilizing the masses to vigorously promote measures that do not cost money or cost less money, and make more use of waste materials and stagnant materials, so as to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Combining learning and promoting advanced experience with creation, advocating that the backward learn from the advanced, and constantly creating on the basis of learning. Combining the manufacture of new equipment and the improvement of old equipment, with transformation as the main focus, to prevent adding new equipment on the one hand and damaging old equipment on the other hand. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also emphasized that vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization must implement the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" working method. Leading cadres should vigorously support and actively encourage all the initiatives of the masses, provide various conveniences, and promptly point out the direction.
    At present, Tianjin's eight major industries, including shoemaking, weaving, and sock knitting, and five major types of work, including foundry workers, crushing workers, and packaging workers, have begun to vigorously promote mechanization. Through the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on vigorously promoting mechanization, the degree of mechanization in the Tianjin Shoe Factory has increased from 36% last year to the current 55.2%, greatly improving labor productivity. In order to meet the needs of the processing workshop for castings, the foundry workshop of the Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory used waste materials to manufacture drum screens, belt sand loosening machines, quicksand machine conveyor belts, large-piece molding sand adding devices, etc., basically achieving foundry mechanization, and it is expected that the annual output will be more than 30% higher than last year.

### 让群众高涨的革命热情汇成技术革新的热潮  天津向机械化半机械化疾进  八大行业　五大工种  要把笨重的手工劳动变为轻巧的机械劳动

    让群众高涨的革命热情汇成技术革新的热潮
    天津向机械化半机械化疾进
    八大行业　五大工种
    要把笨重的手工劳动变为轻巧的机械劳动
    本报天津16日电　天津市工业战线上的技术革新和技术革命运动进入了一个新的阶段，全市制鞋、织布、织袜、玻璃、纸制品、橡胶、地毯、盐等八大行业和铸工、粉碎工、搬运工、锻打工、包装工等五大工种运动的矛头已经指向了机械化、半机械化。中共天津市委员会为了推动全市迅速掀起大搞机械化半机械化的高潮，最近特地召开了动员大会。
    天津市工业战线上自反右倾、鼓干劲、掀起增产节约运动的新高潮以来，全市职工便纷纷开展技术革新和技术革命活动。机械化、半机械化，有了很大提高。但是也还有很大潜力，尚存在着大量手工劳动和笨重劳动。为了使全市工业生产提前跨进1960年，更多地超额完成今年计划，并且为明年的跃进作好准备，中共天津市委认为：必须把群众高涨的革命热情引导到技术革新和技术革命方面来，从现在开始，掀起一个全市性的大搞机械化和半机械化的热潮，努力提高劳动生产率。
    大搞机械化、半机械化，应从哪些方面着手呢？中共天津市委确定从以下几个方面着手：一、手工操作部门尽量使用机器代替手工，用电力作动力；二、机械化程度较高的部门要力争改进技术，更上一层楼，向专用化、自动化、连续化、组合化和高速化的方向发展；三、辅助部门要用机器代替推、拉、扛、背、砸、端、抡、搅等笨重体力劳动，起重、装卸、搬运部门实现机械化和半机械化，尤其是当前急迫的任务；四、针对生产上的薄弱环节，增添一些关键性的设备，以平衡生产能力。此外，还必须注意改进工艺，采用新技术，调整劳动组织，进行适当的生产改组，这也是提高劳动生产率的重要方面。各行业由于特点不同，在大搞机械化时，也要有不同的重点。
    在大搞机械化和半机械化的作法方面，中共天津市委提出要贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，实行洋法和土法结合，大型和中小型结合，根据需要与可能，能洋就洋，不能洋就土，或者搞些土洋结合的简易设备，作到先土后洋，逐步提高，同时要贯彻大、中、小并举的方针，既要搞些大型设备，也要注意搞些小型设备，以小化大，国家投资与自力更生结合起来，以自力更生为主，充分发动群众大搞不花钱或少花钱、多利用废料和呆滞材料的措施，以便多快好省地实现机械化和半机械化。学习、推广先进经验和创造结合起来，提倡落后的向先进的学习，并在学习的基础上不断创造。制造新设备和改进旧设备相结合，以改造为主，防止一方面增添新的，一方面损坏旧的。中共天津市委还强调指出，大搞机械化和半机械化必须贯彻“两参一改三结合”的工作方法。领导干部要大力支持和积极鼓励群众的一切创举，给予各种方便，并及时指出方向。
    目前，天津市制鞋、织布、织袜等八大行业和铸工、粉碎、包装等五大工种，已经开始大搞机械化。天津制鞋厂通过以大搞机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，全厂机械化程度已由去年的36％，提高到目前的55.2％，大大提高了劳动生产率。天津纺织机械厂铸工车间为了满足加工车间对铸件的需要，用废物料制造了滚筒筛、带式松砂机、流砂机输送带、大件造型加砂装置等，基本上作到了铸工机械化，预计全年产量可比去年提高30％以上。
