The newly established canteen is so good!
    Liu Demin

    I only gave birth to one precious son in my life, named Heiniu, who is a well-known strong young man in the village. He has a dark red face, a short and sturdy figure, and his sleeves are always rolled up tightly, making him look very vigorous. When it comes to work, two strong men are no match for him; when it comes to work assignments, he is a popular figure in the village. Recently, everyone elected him as the production team leader. I love him from the bottom of my heart. Who would have thought that we, mother and son, would have been sulking for a few days without saying a word because of the canteen?
    One day, Heiniu came back from a meeting at our People's Commune and said to me excitedly, "Mom, our village is going to set up a public canteen soon!" When I heard him say that we were going to set up a canteen again, I paused for a long time before saying, "Humph, why are we setting up a canteen again?" Seeing that I wasn't happy, Heiniu took the opportunity after dinner and said, "Mom, running a public canteen is following the path of socialism. Aren't you always hoping for the construction of socialism? If we don't do this..." Seeing that he was really going to "make the rice into cooked rice," I angrily interrupted him and said, "Don't make a fuss. I don't want to hear about this or that! You just became a team leader yesterday, and today you're already taking office and being so active!" This angered Heiniu, and he jumped three feet high, saying, "To build socialism, we must be active! Who's as backward as you!" He ran out the door in a gust of wind. I chased after him a few steps, spitting, and said, "Your wings have hardened, and you're throwing the backward hat on my head! Don't leave, let's talk things out!" Because of this, we, mother and son, didn't say a word for a few days, and it felt strange when we met.
    That night, until Heiniu came back from the meeting, I was still squatting on the kang thinking: Humph, I won't participate in the canteen this year no matter what. Last year, everyone ate together, and there wasn't a proper leader (a "proper leader" refers to team cadres and Communist Party members) to manage it. Some people ate their fill and still stuffed themselves; others took the food home, and the elderly couldn't finish it and fed it to the chickens; even the landlord Liu Hongyan secretly stole steamed buns from the canteen several times and took them to the bus station to sell at high prices. They really didn't have the heart of a manager, didn't know the value of rice and flour, and didn't know the parents' kindness if they hadn't raised children. Because of this, Liu Hongyan and a few other good-for-nothings spread rumors, saying, "The canteen food is bad, and the team's spending is wasteful." Of course, the landlord Liu Hongyan never lifted a hand or carried a shoulder in the past, and still ate white rice and fine flour, pork and wine every day, all year round. What did we eat back then? Wasn't it half a year of coarse food? If you don't have a cold illness in your heart, you're not afraid to eat watermelon. I wasn't afraid at all when Liu Hongyan and the others spread rumors about the canteen back then. They had bad intentions and wasted grain. What a pity, truly sinful! Besides, every time I eat a meal, I have to wobble to the canteen, which is so inconvenient....
    The next morning, I went to West Village to talk to Aunt Wang to relieve my depression. The people in the village knew that my old sister and I had been close for thirty or forty years, and we had the same views on fresh things and our conversations were compatible. When my old sister and I met, we couldn't stop talking.
    When I left the village, I ran into Liu Dashui, who lost his wife in March this year. I saw him holding a piece of white paper filled with ballpoint pen writing and asked, "Dashui, where are you going?" He said in a loud voice, "I'm going to the office to apply to join the public canteen!" I asked, "Are you willing?" He said, "How can I not be willing? When I go out, I lock the door, and when I come in, there's no fire in the stove. After working all day, I have to work and cook. This way, I'm so busy that I can't breathe, and it affects the Great Leap Forward, which is infuriating. If we set up a public canteen, then... hahaha!" As soon as his laughter fell, he stared at me again, "These days, people applying to join the canteen are swarming to the office like ants. Can I, a single man, be willing to lag behind!" After he finished speaking, he strode towards the office.
    When I arrived at my old sister's house, according to the past, she would enthusiastically entertain me with food and drink without asking questions. This time, she didn't do that, but smiled even more happily, revealing her toothless mouth, and said, "Old sister, recently, our West Village has set up a public canteen, and this year's canteen is very satisfactory! Has your East Village set it up? No! Why hasn't it been set up yet? No wonder I see you unhappy today, complaining that the new canteen hasn't been set up!"
    My old sister's words confused me. I said to myself: She keeps talking about the new canteen and the Great Leap Forward, what's going on! I was just about to ask her to clarify, but before I could open my mouth, she gently patted my shoulder and said, "Old sister, our West Village's new canteen is: the team leader is also the head cook, the food administrator is a Party member; the women who take turns cooking are all clean and neat, and sincere; meals are bought with meal tickets, adults get more meal tickets per month, and children get less, so no one loses out. This way everyone can eat well and not waste a single grain of rice or flour! Hehe, not only that, everything in the canteen is truly planned in detail and arranged smoothly. The public canteen has many advantages. It truly lives up to its name!" As she spoke, my old sister changed the subject again, "Old sister, last time I heard our Premier Zhou's report, and my heart was so clear. Last year, our Party was so busy that it couldn't take care of the canteen all at once, so it allowed some bad guys to take advantage of the situation and make trouble. Old sister, didn't I tell you last year? Like our West Village's rich peasant Wang Jincai and a few upper-middle peasants, they saw that eating didn't cost money, and the Party members and cadres were all going up the mountains to mine coal and down the rivers to control the water. They just squatted at home eating and picked big bowls, and rolled their eyes when they worked. Jincai's wife cooked in the canteen, avoiding heavy work and being gluttonous and gossipy. This year, everyone suggested that she not cook anymore. On the day the new canteen was set up, everyone posted such a big-character poster for her:
    'Hair combed smooth, face powdered fragrant,
    Afraid to put in effort when cooking, we don't want her this year,
    If you ask her name and surname, it's Chen Guihua.'"
My old sister said to this point, holding my shoulder and saying, "Old sister, those good-for-nothings won't be able to make trouble this year. Don't you think so?"
    My old sister's words hit my heart. I took a long breath, and felt like a heavy stone had been lifted from my heart. At that time, I blushed and told her all about my stubbornness in not wanting to participate in the canteen. After listening, my old sister giggled and said, "Old sister, in the future, it would be best if you ask others to read the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party and Premier Zhou's report more for you."
    After talking to this point, my old sister told me to go visit their newly established canteen. This was really like giving a pillow when you're sleepy! Before I could leave, suddenly, a little girl came with a large bowl of steaming noodles. She warmly said to my old sister, "Grandma Wang, eat!" My old sister gratefully took the noodles and said, "Juhua, why don't you bring food to your mother-in-law? Your Grandma Wang's legs don't hurt, she can walk!" The little girl shook her head and said, "My brother and I earn work points, and every day after school, he sends food to my grandmother first, and I send food to you first. It'll be cold later, and you old people will freeze on the way!" Then she said to me, "Grandma, I'll bring you food in a little while!" She ran out the door like a gust of wind.
    Eating the fragrant, thin, and thinly sliced cabbage vegetarian noodles, I couldn't help but blurt out this sentence: "Old sister, the newly established canteen is so good!"

### 新办起的食堂可好啦！

    新办起的食堂可好啦！
    刘德民
    我一辈子只生养了一个宝贝后生，名叫黑牛，是村里有名的棒小子。他生着副黑里透红的脸膛，身材矮敦敦的，袖口打常挽的生紧，看来虎彪彪的。论干活儿，两条大汉不是他的敌手；论工作，又是村里的红火角色。新近，大家还选他当生产队长。我打心里就爱他，谁想，为办食堂，我娘儿俩闹的几天噘着嘴没说半句话。
    一天，黑牛从咱人民公社开会回来，兴冲冲地对我说：“妈，咱村马上就要办公共食堂！”我听他说又要办食堂，顿了半天才说：“哼，怎么又要办食堂啦？”黑牛见我不乐意，晚饭后，他挤了个空子说：“妈，办公共食堂，是走社会主义的道儿，你不是整天盼社会主义建成嘛？不这样……”我见他真的要“生米做成熟饭”，生气的打断他的话，说：“别吵吵，这样呀，那样呀的，我才不爱听呢！你昨天当了名队长，今天就走马上任，积极成啥啦！”这下可把黑牛惹火啦，他一跳三尺高，说：“建设社会主义，就得积极嘛！谁像你这样落后！”他一溜风朝门外走啦。我撵了几步，飞着唾沫星子说：“你翅膀硬啦，随便把落后的帽子给我头上扔！别走开，有理咱摊开讲讲！”就为这个，我娘儿俩几天没说半句话，见了面心里觉得怪别扭的。
    当天晚上，直到黑牛开会回来，我还蹲在炕上想着心思：哼，今年办食堂，我怎么也不参加。去年，大家同块儿吃饭，没有个正柱子（正柱子是指的队干和村里的共产党员）领导经营。有的吃饱饭，还放开肚皮硬撑着吃；有的把饭领回家，老年人吃不完就喂鸡；像地主刘红眼还几次把食堂的馍偷去拿到汽车站抬高价卖呢。真是没当家的心，不知米面贵，没养儿的人，不知父母恩。就这样，刘红眼他们几个不成器的扔货，还造谣生事地说：“食堂吃的瞎，队里使的扎”，当然，地主刘红眼过去手不提，肩不挑，一年三百六十天还吃的白米细面，猪肉酒菜。我们那时吃些什么呢？可不是糠菜半年粮嘛？心中无冷病，那怕吃西瓜，刘红眼他们给食堂那会子造谣，我半点也不怕。他们不安好心，糟踏五谷，可惜了，真造罪！再说，每顿吃个饭，我又得摇摇晃晃去食堂，多不方便……。
    第二天上午，我去西村找王大妈拉话消闷。村子的人都知道我老姐妹俩相好了三、四十年，对个鲜事儿看法一样，说话相投。我老姐妹见着面，拉起话儿就没个完。
    出了村子，我和今年3月死了媳妇的刘大水碰了个满怀。我看他拿着张写满水笔字的白纸，就问：“大水，上哪儿去？”他高喉咙大嗓音地说：“上办公室申请参加公共食堂！”我问：“你愿意？”他说：“那咋能不愿意呢，我出门一把锁，进门一把火。一天劳动回家，锅炉里没个火星星，又要干活，又要做饭。这样，自个忙的透不过气小事，影响跃进可气死人呢。办起公共食堂，那就……哈哈哈！”笑音刚落，他又盯着我，“这几天，申请参加食堂的人蚂蚁似串的朝办公室去。难道咱个独身汉还甘心落后嘛！”他说完就大步流星地朝办公室走去了。
    到了老妹子家里，按照以往，她没问青红皂白就殷勤地招待我吃吃喝喝。这回，她见了我没这样，只是更显得高兴地笑咧着没门牙的嘴，说：“老姐呀，新近，咱西村办起公共食堂啦，今年的食堂办的可称心呢！咱东村办着没有？没有！怎么还不办哩？怪不得我看你今天不高兴，嫌没办起新食堂！”
    老妹子的话弄得我摸不住门路。我心中对自己说：张口新食堂，闭口跃进呢，到底是怎么回事儿！我正要向她问个明白，可是，没等得开口，她就轻轻地拍打着我的肩膀，说：“老姐呀，咱西村的新食堂是：队长兼着灶长，伙食管理员是个党员；轮着做饭的妇女，个个干净利索，心眼厚诚；吃饭用饭票买，大人每月发的饭票多，小孩发的少，都不吃亏。这样大家能吃好，也不浪费半粒米面！嘻嘻，不光这些，食堂的一切真是计划的又精细，安排的又顺眼。公共食堂优越性多。真是名不虚传呀！”老妹子说着，又转了话题，“老姐呀，前回我听了咱周总理的报告，心里可亮堂啦。去年，咱们党事儿忙得紧，一下子顾不上食堂，就叫一些儿坏蛋钻空子，捣鬼。老姐呀，我去年不是对你说过嘛？像咱西村的富农王金财和几家上中农，那会子看到吃饭不要钱，党员干部又都上山采煤，下河治水。他们就蹲在家里吃饭拣大碗，做活翻白眼。金财的老婆在食堂做饭，躲重投轻，馋嘴滑舌。今年大家都提意见不要她做饭了，新办起食堂那天，大家给她贴了这么张大字报：
    ‘头儿梳的光，脸蛋擦的香，
    做饭怕出劲，今年不要她，
    要问名和姓，便是陈桂花。’”老妹子说到这里，按住我的肩头说：“老姐呀，那些不成器的货，今年可就捣鬼不成了。你说是不？”
    老妹子的话句句打中我的心坎，我长长的舒了口气，心里觉得像丢掉了块沉甸甸的石头。当时，我红着脸把自己不愿参加食堂的死心眼一五一十的说给她。老妹子听罢，咯咯地笑着说：“老姐呀，今后请教别人多给自己读党的八中全会文件和周总理的报告，那再好也没有了。”
    话儿拉到这里，老妹子告诉要我去她们新办的食堂参观参观。这真是瞌睡了给个枕头！没等得走开，猛乍，有个小姑娘端着大碗热气喷喷的面条来啦。她亲热的对老妹子说：“王大婆，吃饭吧！”老妹子感激的接过面条，说：“菊花，你怎么不给你婆婆端饭去？你王大婆腿又不疼，走得去！”小姑娘摇晃着小脑袋，说：“我和我哥哥把工分啦，每天放学回来，他给我婆婆先送饭，我给你老人家先送饭。往后天冷啦，你们老年人，来回路上冻哩！”又对我说：“婆婆，待会儿，我给你就把饭端来！”她一溜风似地朝门外跑去啦。
    我吃着香气喷喷，赶的又薄，切的又细的白菜素面条，心里不禁跳出了这句话：“老妹子呀，新办起的食堂可好啦！”
