Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th. The Japanese Communist Party issued an appeal on the 28th, calling on all democratic forces in Japan to rise up and repel the attack launched by the Nobusuke Kishi government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party against the people. It called for exposing the false propaganda spread by the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party regarding the Kishi government's suppression of petitioning masses on the 27th, and its planned new suppression plot. It also called for strengthening unity and joint action to continue the struggle until the plot to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is crushed and the "Security Treaty" is abolished.

The appeal, published in a special edition of "Akahata" on the 28th, stated, "Yesterday's nationwide action climax expressed strong protests and indignation against the government and the ruling party's brutal actions directly targeting the interests of the people." The appeal said: "Submitting petitions to the Diet is a legitimate right of the people. The government and the ruling party disregarded this right, mobilized 5,000 police officers, and dispatched police cars and armored vehicles to suppress the petitioners, even mobilizing the Self-Defense Forces. Extreme nationalist hooligans acted as accomplices of the government. We must not allow this violent suppression."

The appeal accused Trotskyites of exploiting the tense situation created by the government's suppression measures to provoke and undermine united action.

The appeal continued: "The leaders of the government and the ruling party expected to create a tense situation in advance, and then they immediately used the temporary confusion caused by it to launch a newspaper campaign to slander the people, and set about suppressing various democratic organizations. They used this opportunity to try to forcibly implement reactionary policies, including revising the 'Security Treaty' and providing compensation to South Vietnam. They also want to take this opportunity to formulate laws to deprive people of their right to petition and demonstrate near the Diet. They also concentrated their fire on slandering the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, insisting that they were plotting revolutionary subversion."

The appeal called on all democratic forces in Japan to smash the suppression of the people by the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party, and to intensify the struggle to further promote united action against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th. More than 50,000 people from all walks of life in Osaka held a citizens' rally on the 27th against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Workers, farmers, students, women, and others set off from five locations, holding demonstrations along the way, and converged at the swimming pool in the center of Osaka to participate in the rally.

The conference unanimously adopted a resolution demanding that the Japanese government immediately stop the U.S.-Japan talks for revising the "Security Treaty."

The conference also adopted a declaration stating that revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" would strengthen Japan's militarization, aggravate tensions in Asia, and lead to Japan's nuclear armament and the dispatch of troops abroad.

The conference declaration resolutely stated that not only must the government be forced to immediately stop holding U.S.-Japan talks and crush the conspiracy to sign a new "Security Treaty," and strive to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet; but also to further struggle with all our strength for the realization of a peaceful, independent, and neutral Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th. More than 600 women in Tokyo gathered today to listen to the report on her visit to China by the member of the Japanese delegation celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of China, critic Kikue Yamakawa. The gathering was jointly organized by the Japan-China Women's Exchange Association and the Japan-China Friendship Association.

Yamakawa pointed out that if the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is realized, the relationship between Japan and China will further deteriorate, and there will be no possibility of restoring diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Yamakawa called on all Japanese women to stand up and launch a struggle against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Yamakawa pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government is using the pretext of falsely claiming that "China will invade Japan" to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," but China has always been advancing towards building a peaceful socialist society and will not and does not need to invade Japan.

She then talked about the Great Leap Forward in China's economy, culture, education, and women's liberation.

Yamakawa emphasized that restoring diplomatic relations with China as soon as possible is Japan's happiness, and it is also a way to achieve peace in Asia.

The meeting screened the documentary of the Chinese Song and Dance Troupe's performance in Japan and the feature film "New Year Sacrifice." (Picture attached)

On November 27th, demonstrators in Tokyo surrounded the Diet (the tall building in the back) which was in session, and the area around the Diet became "a sea of red flags and placards." Xinhua News Agency dispatch

    日本共产党号召全国民主力量
    击退岸政府向人民发动的疯狂进攻  加强团结斗争阻止修改“安全条约”
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本共产党在28日发出呼吁书，号召日本的所有民主力量起来击退岸信介政府和执政的自由民主党向人民发动的进攻，揭露岸信介政府和自由民主党就岸信介政府27日对请愿群众进行镇压所散布的虚假宣传和它策划的新的镇压阴谋，同时加强团结和联合行动，继续进行斗争，直到粉碎修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋和废除“安全条约”时为止。
    在“赤旗报”28日出版的专号上刊载的这项呼吁书说，“昨天的全国性行动高潮，表达了对政府和执政党以人民的利益为直接打击对象的蛮横做法的强烈抗议和愤慨”。呼吁书说：“向国会递交请愿书，是人民的合法权利。政府和执政党无视这种权利，动员了五千名警察，并且出动警车和装甲车来弹压请愿者，甚至出动了自卫队。极端的国家主义流氓恶棍则充当政府的帮凶。我们决不能容许这种暴力镇压”。
    呼吁书指责托洛茨基分子利用由于政府采取镇压措施而造成的紧张局面进行挑衅来破坏统一行动的做法。
    呼吁书接着说：“政府和执政党的领导人事先就指望造成紧张局面，随后他们立即利用了因而造成的暂时混乱状态，发动报纸污蔑人民的运动，并且着手镇压各民主组织。他们利用这个机会，试图强行实施反动政策，包括修改‘安全条约’、给予南越以赔偿。他们还想趁此机会制订法律，来剥夺人民的请愿权利和在国会附近示威的权利。他们还集中火力污蔑共产党和社会党，硬说它们策划革命颠覆活动。”
    呼吁书号召日本所有的民主力量粉碎岸信介政府和自由民主党对人民的镇压，并且加紧进行斗争，来进一步促进反对修改日美“安全条约”的统一行动。
    “赤旗报”专号还刊载了共产党议会党团发表的一项声明。共产党议员们在声明中表示决心为反对修改日美“安全条约”、反对把战争赔偿付给南越而斗争，以实现请愿者和人民的期望。
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本大阪市各界人民五万多人27日举行了反对修改日美“安全条约”市民大会。
    工人、农民、学生、妇女等从五个地方出发，沿途举行示威游行，汇集到大阪市中心的游泳池参加大会。
    大会一致通过决议，要求日本政府立即停止为修改“安全条约”而举行的日美谈判。
    大会还通过宣言说，修改日美“安全条约”将会加强日本的军事化，加剧亚洲紧张局势，并且会导致日本核武装和派兵出国。
    大会宣言坚决表示，不仅要促使政府立即停止举行日美谈判，粉碎签署新“安全条约”的阴谋，争取打倒岸信介内阁；并且要以全部力量进一步为实现和平、独立、中立的日本而斗争到底。
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：东京妇女六百多人今天集会听取日本各界庆祝中国建国十周年代表团团员、评论家山川菊荣的访华报告。集会是由日中妇女交流会和日中友协联合举办的。
    山川指出，如果实现修改日美“安全条约”，日中两国间的关系将更加恶化，根本谈不到恢复两国邦交。
    山川号召全体日本妇女站起来为反对修改日美“安全条约”而展开斗争。
    山川指出，岸信介政府以诬蔑“中国会侵略日本”为借口，要修改日美“安全条约”，但是，中国一向在为着建设和平的社会主义社会而迈进，不会和没有必要来侵略日本。
    她接着谈到中国经济、文化、教育和妇女解放等各方面大跃进的情况。
    山川强调指出，尽速恢复同中国的邦交，这是日本的幸福，同时是实现亚洲和平的途径。
    会上放映了中国歌舞团访日公演的纪录影片和故事片“祝福”。（附图片）
