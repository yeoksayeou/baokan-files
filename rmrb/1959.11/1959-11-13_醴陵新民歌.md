A bumper harvest field connected to a bumper harvest field,
Grain ears are woven into a golden carpet,
With a poem embroidered on it:
The People's Commune is ten thousand years!

So much grain, so many songs,
A hundred dan of grain, ten thousand songs,
Just finished singing a song on the upper hill,
Ten baskets of grain have already been harvested on the lower hill.

Each rice stalk is like a tree trunk,
Each rice ear is more than a foot long,
Each grain of rice is like a pearl,
Every granary is bursting at the roof beam.

Singing folk songs, feeling sweet in our hearts,
Everyone celebrates the harvest year,
Leaping forward in production, and leaping forward again,
Happier lives day by day,
Working together with one heart, adding oil and striving hard,
The late rice harvest will pile the grain up to the sky.

### 醴陵新民歌

    醴陵新民歌丰收田连丰收田，谷穗结成黄金毯，上面绣出诗一句，人民公社万万年。谷子多，歌也多，百担谷子万支歌，上丘刚唱歌一首，下丘已打谷十箩。根根禾秆像树桩，串串稻穗尺多长，粒粒谷子珍珠样，仓仓顶破屋上梁。口唱山歌心里甜，人人喜庆丰收年，生产跃进再跃进，幸福生活日日添，齐心合力加油干，晚稻产谷堆上天。
