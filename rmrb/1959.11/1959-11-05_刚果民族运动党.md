    The Congo National Movement Party is a Congolese nationalist party, founded in Léopoldville, Congo, in 1956. Its chairman is Lumumba, who was recently arrested by the Belgian colonial authorities. This party has a broad representation and influence among all strata of Congolese society. Workers, peasants, merchants, clerks, and religious figures participate in this party.

    The party's political program is: "To demand the realization of democracy, freedom, and equality, to allow the people to participate in the management of the country, to allow the establishment of trade unions and political parties, to strive for the complete independence of the Congo, and after independence, not to exclude the possibility of mutually trusting, beneficial, and lasting cooperation with Belgium." This April, Lumumba issued a statement expressing the Congolese people's determination to break free from colonial status and demanding the establishment of a Congolese government in January 1961. The party opposes the deceptive plan announced by Belgium on October 16 for the so-called phased independence of the Congo and the so-called "elections." Last month, after attending the General Affairs Committee meeting of the All-African People's Conference in Accra, Lumumba also stated: "The Congolese people have made a choice, which is to fight for the immediate independence of the motherland and to completely eradicate the colonial regime."

    刚果民族运动党
    刚果民族运动党是刚果民族主义政党，1956年在刚果的利奥波德维尔成立的，主席是最近被比利时殖民当局逮捕的卢蒙巴。这个党在刚果各阶层中拥有较广泛的代表性和影响。参加这个政党的有工人、农民、商人、职员和宗教界人士。
    这个党的政治斗争纲领是：“要求实现民主、自由、平等，允许人民参与管理国家，允许成立工会和政党，争取刚果的完全独立，在独立后不排斥和比利时进行互相信任、有益和持久合作的可能性。”今年4月卢蒙巴发表声明，表示刚果人民决心摆脱殖民地地位，并要求在1961年1月成立一个刚果政府。该党反对比利时10月16日宣布的所谓让刚果分阶段独立的欺骗性计划和所谓“选举”。卢蒙巴上月在参加阿克拉全非人民大会总务委员会会议后又表示：“刚果人民已经作出了抉择，这就是：争取祖国立即独立和完全铲除殖民政权。”（茂）
