The Radiance of Revolutionary History
Wu Xue

    I greatly admire Comrade Liang Bin's novel "Red Flag Ballad" because it allows us to see the true typical characters of Chinese peasants and the drastic changes in Chinese rural life before and after the Great Revolution. More importantly, through the peasant revolutionary movement in the Hebei Plain, it vividly illustrates that the Chinese Communist Party has attached importance to the peasant issue since the day it was founded. After arduous and in-depth work, the Party has combined the individual resistance of the broad masses of peasants to avenge their grievances into a torrent of class struggle against feudal rule. Looking back today, how glorious and splendid this period of the Party's history is! The character of Jia Xiangnong, the representative of the underground Party in the novel, is an excellent representative of the early leaders of the peasant revolutionary movement. Please see the description of Jia Xiangnong's first encounter with Yan Yuntao, especially the passage he said at the time of parting: "'Please help me do some things!' He wrote a few items on a piece of paper and said: 'For example, how many kinds of taxes are there? Specifically, how much blood and sweat do farmers have to pay? What is the highest land rent? What is the lowest? What is the highest interest rate? What is the lowest? ... Hmm, can you do it?'" As soon as I heard this, I thought of Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." Comrade Liang Bin's description of rural life always runs through a red line of class struggle, and the characterization of peasant character never forgets to reveal the mainstream of revolutionary optimism in their minds. Despite the heavy oppression, they always looked forward to the future and firmly believed in victory. Zhu Lao Zhong is such a typical character.
    The "Red Flag Ballad" performed by the Hebei Provincial Theatre Troupe closely grasps this main line, starting with Zhu Lao Gong sacrificing himself to protect the bell and ending with the initial victory against taxation. It focuses on the contradiction between the landlord Feng Lanchi and the three generations of Zhu Lao Gong and Yan Zhixiang, and focuses on portraying the two main characters of Zhu Lao Zhong and Yan Zhihe. It does not stick to the novel, and there are bold additions and deletions. The adaptation is creative, and therefore successful and moving. The slight inadequacy is that the portrayal of the new generation such as Da Gui, Yuntao, Jiang Tao, especially Chunlan, is not enough. If more attention is paid to the use of some plots, so that people who have not read the novel can also be interested, it would be even better, such as Feng Lanchi seizing the "Pu Hong" (bird name), Chunlan sending the cage cover, etc.
                      ＊　＊　＊
    I believe that the excellent performance of "Red Flag Ballad" surpasses the achievements of the play adaptation. Comrade Liang Bin's original work is full of vigor, authority, and national sentiment in terms of language, character, and structure. Because the director and actors have gone deep into life since the adaptation of the script, and consciously learned from tradition in the performance, appropriately using some Peking Opera movements, hair flicks, martial arts, boxing, as well as storytelling and allegro techniques, they have found an appropriate form of expression for this specific play, thus enhancing the concentration of artistic appeal of the play. It can be called a performance with a unique style. The director's handling has many commendable points, the most brilliant of which is the scene of protecting the bell and reasoning. Zhu Lao Gong took off his long gown, and with a lift of his leg, his long braid wrapped around his neck like a yellow dragon, grabbing Feng Lanchi, whose heart was trembling. His majestic figure and sonorous vernacular were truly justified and imposing. He is like Tianba who拜山 [paying respects to the mountain], but without any trace. In the end, Feng Lanchi is still unreasonable, and Zhu Lao Gong stands in front of the bell holding a guillotine, towering and earth-shattering. Although this struggle ultimately ended in Zhu Lao Gong being deceived and failing, this heroic and unyielding image can no longer be erased from your memory. This is the Chinese peasant. Once such a person accepts the leadership of the Party and recognizes the truth, it is not surprising that he will make the mountains bow and the rivers make way!
    Others, such as Liu Lin teaching his son, and Yuntao joining the Party, combine boxing and martial arts very organically. It is reasonable and not forced.
    If the director allows the military police to gain a little advantage in the last scene in front of the county government when the masses detain the county magistrate's representative and are forced to write a proclamation to abolish the tax collection and withdraw the military police, and then turns danger into safety by detaining the county magistrate's representative in the crisis, this scene will be even more ups and downs. There are many such witty scene treatments in traditional operas for us to learn from.
    In addition, in portraying character, the director also missed some opportunities for further development, such as the scene of Old Donkey's Head angrily scolding Chunlan. This is a depiction of Chunlan's character, which is arranged very profoundly and movingly in the novel. This is a typical rural working woman image who loves life, yearns for the future, and is stubborn, persevering, simple, and kind. Of course, what I mean is not to move the novel onto the stage as it is. If the director puts in some effort, it is possible to make up for some of the inadequacies of this character in the script.
                      ＊　＊　＊
    This play has enriched the performing arts of many actors because it has learned from tradition, which is also very obvious. For example, Lu Su, who plays Zhu Lao Zhong, makes you believe that he is a cheerful, upright, simple, and heroic working people as soon as he appears. However, through the actor's rhythmic lines, thick body, and measured martial arts, the character image is more vivid. Comrade Pan Bo, who plays Yan Zhihe, has a deep grasp of the character who cannot squeeze a fart out of a day's work. He forms a clear contrast with Zhu Lao Zhong. These two characters can be described as complementing each other and are very lovely. If Zhu Lao Zhong's monologue in front of the well recalling the past of fishing, panning for gold, releasing wild horses, and digging ginseng is very brilliant, then Yan Zhihe's performance of grabbing the land with both hands after being forced to sell the treasure land is also very moving. Comrade Chunli, who plays Zhu Laoming, also created a very moving image of a peasant, who is willing to sell everything in order to fight a lawsuit with the landlord, and even falls into begging, settles in the River God Temple, and is often tells the children the story of the older generation who never give up despite being blind. The romantic technique of suddenly regaining his sight after hearing the news of the victory of the Northern Expedition is common in opera. But through the actor's performance, he will make you fully believe that he is real. Several negative characters, such as Sun Shulin, who plays Feng Lanchi, and Zou Henian, who plays Li Decai, have shown their skills and have their own characteristics in their performances. If Li Ge, who plays Yan Laoshang, can put on a conciliatory posture first and deceive Zhu Lao Gong and others aside, would it be better? Because he also comes out fiercely, first, he repeats Feng Lanchi's appearance, and second, Zhu Lao Gong and others who are afraid of being soft and not afraid of being hard will not be fooled by him.
    The "Red Flag Ballad" drama was produced in the Great Leap Forward and is one of the outstanding dramas dedicated to the National Day this year. It is a creative performance. It once again refutes the fallacy of some people who believe that peasant dramas are not durable and that the Great Leap Forward cannot produce good dramas. Although there are some minor flaws, they are insignificant.

    革命历史的光辉
    吴雪
    我十分喜欢梁斌同志的小说“红旗谱”。因为它使我们看到了真正的中国农民的典型人物和大革命前后中国农村生活的剧烈变化。而更重要的是它透过冀中平原农民革命运动，形象地说明了中国共产党从成立那天起就重视农民问题，党经过了艰苦深入的工作，把广大农民报仇雪恨的个人反抗，汇合成一股气势磅礴的反对封建统治的阶级斗争的巨流。今天回过头来看，党的这段历史，是多么光辉灿烂啊！小说中地下党的代表贾湘农这一人物，正是初期领导农民革命运动的优秀代表人物。请看贾湘农初遇严运涛那一段描绘，特别临别时说的那一段话：“‘请你帮我做些事情吧！’他在纸上写了几个项目，说：‘比方说捐税有多少种？具体到农民身上，他们要付出多少血汗？地租高的有多高？低的有多低？利息最高的几分？最低的几分？……嗯，能办得到吗？’”我一听就联想到毛主席的“湖南农民运动考察报告。”梁斌同志笔下的农村生活描写，始终贯串着一股阶级斗争的红线，对于农民性格的刻划，一刻也没有忘记揭示他们思想中革命乐观主义的主流。尽管在重重压榨下，他们总是向往着未来，坚信着胜利。朱老忠就是这样一个典型人物。
    河北省话剧团演出的“红旗谱”，就紧紧地抓住了这一条主线，从朱老巩舍身护钟开始，到反赋税初获胜利结束，集中在地主冯兰池同朱老巩和严志祥祖孙三代的矛盾上，着重刻划了朱老忠和严志和两个主要人物，没有拘泥于小说，有大胆的增删。改编是有创造的，因而也是成功的，动人的。略感不足处是对新生一代如大贵、运涛、江涛特别是春兰刻划不够。有一些情节的运用，如果还更多注意一下，使没有看小说的人也一样感到兴趣就更好了，如冯兰池夺“脯红”（鸟名），春兰送笼套等。
                      ＊　＊　＊
    我以为“红旗谱”出色的演出，还超过了剧本改编的成绩。梁斌同志的原著，在语言人物性格，以及章法布局上都是有气魄，有威势，极富于民族情调的。由于导演、演员从剧本一改编起，就深入生活，并有意识地在演出上向传统学习，适当地运用了一些京戏身架，甩发，武功，拳术，以及评话快书等技巧，为这个特定的剧本找到了恰当的表现形式，因而更增强了这个戏艺术感染的浓度。可以称得起是一出别具风格的演出。导演的处理，有许多值得称赞的地方，最精彩的要算护钟辩理一场，朱老巩扒下长衫，一提腿，那长长的发辫像黄龙缠腰一般地自己绕在脖子上，一把抓住心里在发抖的冯兰池，那雄壮的身段，铿锵的白口，真是理直气壮，声势夺人。有如拜山的天霸，但却一点不着痕迹。最后冯兰池仍是蛮不讲理，朱老巩手抱铡刀在钟前一站，顶天立地，震撼人心。这场斗争，最终虽然是以朱老巩受骗失败了。但这个英勇不屈的形象，再也不能从你记忆里抹去。这就是中国的农民。这样的人，一旦接受了党的领导，认识了真理，他要叫高山低头，河水让路，又有什么奇怪呢？
    其他如柳林教子，运涛入党，把拳术同武功结合得很有机。合情合理，不是生搬硬套。
    导演假如在最后县衙门前群众扣住县长的代表，被迫写撤销收税的布告，撤退军警那一场，先让军警占点优势，在危急中扣住县长代表，才转危为安，这场戏当会更有起伏。传统戏曲中不少这种机智的场面处理，可供我们借鉴。
    另外在刻划人物性格上，导演也还放过一些可以进一步发挥的机会，如老驴头怒责春兰一场，这是描写春兰性格的，小说上安排得十分深刻动人，这是一个热爱生活，憧憬未来，倔强，坚忍，朴质，善良的典型的农村劳动妇女形象。当然我的意思不是说要把小说原样搬上舞台，如果导演下一些工夫，是可以弥补一些剧本上对这个人物的不足之处的。
                      ＊　＊　＊
    这个戏由于学习了传统，许多演员的表演艺术更加丰满了，也是很显然的。如饰朱老忠的鲁速，一亮相就使你相信他是一个爽朗、梗直、纯朴、豪迈的劳动人民，但通过演员有节奏的念白，浑厚的身段，有分寸的武功，就使人物形象更加鲜明。饰严志和的潘波同志，从念到做把一个成天价碌碡轧不出个屁来的性格，掌握得很有深度。他同朱老忠形成一个鲜明的对比，这两个人物，可谓相得益彰，十分可爱。如果说朱老忠在井台前回忆过去打鱼，淘金，放野马，挖人参那段独白，很有光彩的话，那严志和在被迫出卖了宝地之后，两手抓着土地那一段表演，也是十分感人的。饰朱老明的村里同志，也创造了一个十分感人的农民形象，为同地主打官司，不惜当尽卖绝，以至落于乞讨，在河神庙安身，两眼失明，仍常给孩子们讲老一辈念念不服输的故事。至后一听说北伐胜利消息，顿然瞎眼重明，这种浪漫手法，在戏曲里是常见的。但通过演员的表演，他会使你充分相信他是真的。几个反面人物如饰冯兰池的孙树林、饰李德才的邹鹤年都见工夫，演来各有特点。饰严老尚的李戈，如能先摆出一副和事佬的姿态出场，把朱老巩等骗过一旁，是否更好些。因为他也气势汹汹出场，第一与冯兰池出场重复，第二怕软不怕硬的朱老巩等也不会上他的当。
    “红旗谱”话剧是大跃进中产生的，今年国庆献礼优秀剧目之一。是一次创造性的演出。它又一次反驳了某些认为农民戏不耐看，大跃进产生不出好戏的谬论。尽管还有某些小疵，那就微不足道了。
