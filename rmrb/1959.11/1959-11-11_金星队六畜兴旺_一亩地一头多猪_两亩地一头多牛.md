Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, November 5th: The Jin Xing Production Team of the Choucheng People's Commune in Yiwu County, Zhejiang Province, has comprehensively developed animal husbandry and now boasts 1.8 pigs per mu of cultivated land and more than one cow per two mu of cultivated land. The team has 203 mu of cultivated land and currently raises a total of 372 pigs, 138 cows, 529 sheep, 917 chickens, ducks, and geese, and 220 beehives. The entire production team presents a prosperous scene of flourishing livestock.

Since communization last year, the production team has vigorously implemented the policy of "walking on two legs," further developing collective animal husbandry production. They established two pig farms, seven cattle farms, and four sheep farms, and formed four specialized livestock production teams. They also assisted small teams and commune members with fewer livestock and poultry to overcome specific difficulties, promoting balanced development in animal husbandry production.

Due to the large number of livestock raised, a large amount of high-quality fertilizer has been accumulated. This year, a total of 109 dan of high-quality manure was applied per mu of early and mid-season rice. The rice is growing very well, with early and mid-season rice production increasing by 45% compared to last year. This has also greatly saved labor in fertilizer accumulation, creating more favorable conditions for developing diversified operations.

In the rapid development of animal husbandry, the production team relied on the masses and firmly grasped the three key issues of solving the sources of livestock and poultry, feed, and disease prevention. Regarding livestock and poultry sources, the team resolutely implemented the policy of self-breeding and self-raising, planned to cultivate female livestock, vigorously promoted breeding work, and household incubation of poultry. All the team's sows, cows, and ewes are now pregnant, and have already produced 70 piglets, 30 calves, and 210 lambs. Regarding feed, the team focuses on self-sufficiency and green and coarse feed. They plant in the fields and search in the mountains, using silage methods to prepare sufficient feed for the whole year. This summer and autumn alone, they collected more than 400,000 jin of wild feed. The production team has also established a veterinary clinic to strengthen disease prevention work, and has basically eliminated infectious diseases such as swine fever, erysipelas, and anthrax, ensuring the healthy growth of livestock.

Recently, inspired by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the production team is becoming more and more energetic, and has revised its animal husbandry production plan, requiring that by the end of the year, it reach 2.2 pigs per mu of land, 1.3 cows, and 5.2 sheep.

    金星队六畜兴旺
    一亩地一头多猪
    两亩地一头多牛
    据新华社杭州5日电　浙江义乌县稠城人民公社金星生产队由于全面发展畜牧业，已做到每亩耕地有猪一点八头，每两亩耕地有牛一头多。全队有耕地二百零三亩，目前共养猪三百七十二头，牛一百三十八头，另外还养羊五百二十九只，鸡、鸭、鹅九百一十七只，蜜蜂二百二十群。整个生产队呈现了一片六畜兴旺的繁荣景象。
    去年公社化后，这个生产队大力贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针，进一步发展集体的畜牧业生产，办了两个养猪场、七个养牛场和四个养羊场，建立了四个畜牧生产专业队；并且帮助饲养家畜家禽少的小队和社员克服具体困难，使畜牧业生产得到平衡发展。
    由于牲畜养得多，优质肥料也就积得多。今年合计为每亩早、中稻施优质栏肥一百零九担。稻子长得很好，早、中稻比去年增产45％。并且大大节省了积肥劳动力，更有条件来开展多种经营。
    这个生产队在迅速发展畜牧业中，依靠群众，紧紧抓住了解决畜源禽源、饲料、防疫等三个关键问题。畜源禽源方面，坚决贯彻自养自繁的方针，有计划地培养母畜，大抓配种工作和户孵家禽工作。全队母猪、母牛、母羊现在已全部配种满怀，并已产下仔猪七十头、牛犊三十头、羊羔二百一十只。饲料方面，以生产自给、青粗为主。地里种，山上找，用青贮办法备足常年饲料，今年夏秋两季就采集了野生饲料四十多万斤。生产队还建立有兽医室，加强防疫工作，已基本消灭了猪瘟、丹毒、炭疽等传染病，保证牲畜健康成长。
    最近，这个生产队在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，干劲愈来愈足，修订了畜牧生产规划，要求年底达到每亩田二点二头猪、一点三头牛、五点二只羊。
