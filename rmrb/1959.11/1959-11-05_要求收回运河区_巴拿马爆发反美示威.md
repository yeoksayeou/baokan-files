Xinhua News Agency, Panama City, 4th: On November 3rd, the 56th anniversary of Panama's independence, Panamanian students and youth held demonstrations and marches in the border area of the Panama Canal Zone, which is under American occupation, demanding the return of the Panama Canal Zone to Panama.

When the demonstration march intended to enter the Canal Zone, American police controlling the area attacked the masses with clubs, water hoses, and tear gas, preventing them from advancing. Infuriated Panamanian youths retaliated with stones. American police arrested several Panamanian students. Aquilino Boyd, former Panamanian Foreign Minister who sponsored the demonstration, addressed the demonstrating young students at the border of the Canal Zone, saying: "We believe that soon, we will officially plant the Panamanian flag on this piece of Panamanian territory."

An anti-American demonstration was also held in front of the American Embassy in Panama City. Demonstrators tore down the American flag and destroyed it. The crowd also threw stones, breaking the embassy's windows.

The issue of defending canal sovereignty has become an increasingly prominent central issue in Panamanian political life. People from all walks of life in Panama are very indignant about the American occupation of the Panama Canal Zone, which damages Panamanian sovereignty and infringes upon Panama's national interests. They demand that the canal be nationalized and oppose American imperialism's political and economic enslavement of Panama. Around this sharp national struggle, anti-American sentiment among Panamanians is rising. James, a reporter for the American "New York Post," recently reported that "Panama is seething with discontent" and "I have never heard such sharp opposition to 'Yankees' as I heard during this trip to Panama."

Panamanian Foreign Minister Miguel Moreno recently condemned the United States at the United Nations General Assembly for "repeatedly ignoring" the amended Panamanian-American treaty of 1955 and for adopting a discriminatory attitude towards Panamanian workers in the Canal Zone. Prior to this, Panamanian Minister of Interior and Justice Bassan pointed out with discontent that the number of ships passing through the Panama Canal has increased unprecedentedly, while Panama's economic situation has deteriorated. Unemployment has increased and sales of goods have decreased. He suggested that Panama should base the calculation of canal rents on the tonnage or value of goods carried by ships passing through the canal. Former Foreign Minister Boyd proposed in the National Assembly that Panama should receive 50% of the total canal revenue. At the same time, many Panamanian officials favor the idea of nationalizing the Panama Canal.

    要求收回运河区
    巴拿马爆发反美示威
    据新华社4日讯　巴拿马城消息：在11月3日巴拿马独立五十六周年纪念日这一天，巴拿马学生和青年在美国占领下的巴拿马运河区边境地带举行了示威游行，要求把巴拿马运河区归还给巴拿马。
    当示威游行队伍打算进入运河区时，控制这一地区的美国警察用木棒、水龙头和催泪瓦斯向群众袭击，阻止他们前进，被激怒的巴拿马青年们用石头还击。美国警察逮捕了好几个巴拿马学生。赞助这次示威的巴拿马前外交部长阿基利诺·博伊德在运河区边境地带对示威的青年学生发表讲话说：“我们相信，不久以后，我们将在这一块巴拿马领土上正式插上巴拿马的国旗。”
    在巴拿马城的美国大使馆门前也举行了反美示威。示威的人们扯下了美国国旗并且把它撕毁。群众还投掷石块，打碎了大使馆的玻璃窗。
    保卫运河主权问题已经成为巴拿马政治生活中越来越突出的一个中心问题。巴拿马广大阶层的人民对于美国占领巴拿马运河区、破坏巴拿马主权、侵犯巴拿马民族利益的行为感到非常愤慨。他们要求把运河收归国有，反对美帝国主义对巴拿马政治上和经济上的奴役。围绕着这个尖锐的民族斗争，巴拿马人的反美情绪日益高涨。美国“纽约邮报”记者詹姆斯不久以前报道说，“巴拿马在不满情绪中沸腾”，“我从来还没有听到过像这次巴拿马之行时所听到的如此尖锐地反对‘美国佬’的言行”。
    巴拿马外交部长米格尔·莫雷诺最近在联合国大会上谴责美国“一再无视”1955年修改的巴、美条约，对运河区的巴拿马工人采取歧视态度。在这以前，巴拿马内政和司法部长巴桑不满地指出，通过巴拿马运河的船只次数空前增加，而巴拿马的经济情况却每况愈下。失业人数增加，货物销售量减少。他建议巴拿马应根据通过运河的船只的载货量或货物价值来作为计算运河租金的基础。前外交部长博伊德在国民议会中提出建议，巴拿马应该得到运河总收入的50％。同时许多巴拿马官员赞成把巴拿马运河收归国有的主张。
