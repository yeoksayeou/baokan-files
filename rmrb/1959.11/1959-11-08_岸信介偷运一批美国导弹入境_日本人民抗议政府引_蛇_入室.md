    Kishi Nobusuke Secretly Smuggles a Batch of American Missiles into Japan
    Japanese People Protest Government for Leading "Snakes" into the House
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 6th: Despite the Japanese public's firm opposition, the Kishi Nobusuke government secretly transported fourteen American "Sidewinder" air-to-air missiles into Japan by American military aircraft at noon today. After arriving at the U.S. military's Tachikawa base in Tokyo, this batch of missiles was immediately transported by the Japanese "Defense Agency" to Komaki base. According to Kyodo News, this batch of missiles will soon be handed over to the Air Force in Gifu for test firing.
    Akagi Munenori, Director General of the Japanese "Defense Agency," once revealed that Japan had ordered a total of ninety "Sidewinder" missiles from the United States. Today's shipment is only the first batch.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 7th: The Japanese "Joint Struggle Council Against Bringing Missiles and Nuclear Weapons into Japan" issued a statement today, strongly protesting the Kishi Nobusuke government's secret transport of fourteen American "Sidewinder" missiles into Japan yesterday.
    The statement accused the "Defense Agency" of violating its promise to announce the transport of missiles and accused government officials of despicable behavior, such as pretending not to know at yesterday's Diet session.
    The Joint Struggle Council decided to combine the movement to prevent the transport of missiles and nuclear weapons into Japan with the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty"; to pass resolutions protesting the government at various gatherings; to launch a struggle by the All Garrison Workers' Union against missile testing; and to hold the government accountable in the Diet, etc.
    Immediately after issuing the statement, the Joint Struggle Council sent representatives to the "Defense Agency" to protest.
    Equipping and producing missiles is an important part of the Japanese ruling group's nuclear armament plan. The Kishi Nobusuke government has already formulated a six-year military expansion plan focusing on nuclear armament. Japanese monopoly capital groups such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Fuji, and Kawasaki are vying to trial-produce various types of missiles in order to make a fortune in nuclear armament. Yesterday, at the Second Joint Conference of Japanese and American Weapons Industries held in Tokyo, the Japan Ordnance Association also requested the U.S. side to provide technical and economic "assistance" for Japan's missile production.
    According to today's "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," the Japanese side also requested the U.S. side at the meeting to "assist" Japan's weapons industry and weapons exports.

### 岸信介偷运一批美国导弹入境  日本人民抗议政府引“蛇”入室

    岸信介偷运一批美国导弹入境
    日本人民抗议政府引“蛇”入室
    据新华社6日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府不顾日本公众的坚决反对，在今天中午已经用美军飞机偷偷地把十四枚美国“响尾蛇式”空空导弹运进日本。这批导弹到达东京的美军立川基地后立即被日本“防卫厅”运到了小牧基地。据共同社报道，这批导弹将在不久交给岐阜的空军部队试射。
    日本“防卫厅”长官赤城宗德曾经透露，日本共向美国订购了九十枚“响尾蛇式”导弹。今天运到的只是第一批。
    据新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本“反对把导弹和核武器运进日本共同斗争会议”今天发表声明，强烈抗议岸信介政府昨天把十四枚美国“响尾蛇式”导弹偷运到日本。
    声明指责“防卫厅”违背运进导弹时要公布的诺言，并指责政府负责人在昨天举行的国会会议上假装不知道等卑鄙行为。
    这个共同斗争会议决定，要把阻止向日本运进导弹与核武器的运动同阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争结合起来；在各种集会上通过抗议政府的决议；由全驻军工会展开反对试验导弹的斗争；在国会里追究政府的责任等。
    共同斗争会议发表声明后随即派代表到“防卫厅”进行抗议。
    装备和生产导弹是日本统治集团实行核武装计划的重要组成部分。岸信介政府已经制订了以核武装为重点的六年扩军计划。日本的三菱、三井、富士、川崎等垄断资本集团正在竞相试制各种类型的导弹，以便在核武装中大发其财。昨天，日本武器工业会还在东京举行的日美两国武器工业会第二次联席会议上，要求美方对日本的导弹生产给予技术和经济“援助”。
    据“日本经济新闻”今天报道，日方在会上还要求美方“援助”日本的武器工业和武器的输出。
