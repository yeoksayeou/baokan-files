Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 20th - In the fifteen years since liberation, Albanian agriculture has continuously advanced with great strides, and the face of the rural economy has undergone fundamental changes.
        Rapid Agricultural Development in Ten Years
        Annual Average Growth of 9%
According to statistics, during the first and second Five-Year Plans (1951-1960), Albanian agricultural production developed at an average annual growth rate of 9%. Compared with 1938 before liberation, the output of some major crops this year has increased very significantly. Among them, grain will increase by nearly two and a half times, tobacco will increase five times, and cotton will increase fifteen times. The total agricultural output value in 1958 had already increased to 173% of that in 1938, and this year it will surge by another 26% compared to 1958.
Since liberation, Albania has developed and expanded the diversified operations of the rural economy, especially vigorously planting cash crops, thereby strongly supporting the development of Albanian industry. In 1938, the output value of Albania's cash crops (mainly tobacco) accounted for only 2% of the total agricultural output value. At that time, the country only had 290 hectares of land planted with cotton and only 2,600 hectares planted with tobacco; but today, the planting area of cotton and tobacco has increased by more than 81.5 times and 5.5 times respectively. The production of cotton and tobacco not only meets the domestic industry's need for raw materials, but can also be processed into finished or semi-finished products for export. As for sugar beets, which only began to be planted after liberation, their annual output can already be used to produce more than 12,000 tons of sugar.
        Livestock Numbers Per Capita
        Rank First in the Balkan Peninsula
Albanian animal husbandry has also made great achievements. Now, calculated per capita, Albania's livestock numbers rank first in the Balkan Peninsula, and the number of sheep ranks third in Europe. In 1958, there was an average of one cow for every three people and two sheep for every person in the country. The meat and milk yield of livestock are also constantly improving. Albania uses its favorable geographical and climatic conditions to develop fruit tree cultivation and forestry. In the past fifteen years, the number of various fruit trees has increased sevenfold, and grapes have increased sixfold. During this period, afforestation reached more than 17,000 hectares, and another 57,000 hectares of forests were improved. At present, the total forest cover in Albania accounts for 47% of the country's area, making it one of the countries rich in forests, second only to Finland and Sweden in Europe, and ranking third. Calculated per capita, Albania has 53.6 cubic meters of forest per person.
        Socialist Agriculture Already Holds Absolute Advantage
        Cooperative Farmers Account for 69.6% of Total Farmers
The rapid development of agricultural collectivization is a fundamental condition for the major changes in Albania's rural economy. At present, socialist agriculture already holds an absolute advantage in Albania. According to the latest data, farmers who have joined agricultural cooperatives account for 69.6% of the country's farmers, and land that has achieved agricultural collectivization accounts for 81.5% of the country's total cultivated land area. If the land of state-owned farms is added, the cultivated land owned by socialist agriculture accounts for about 84% of the country's total cultivated land area. Today, the grain output of the socialist agricultural sector accounts for 66.4% of the country's total grain output, while the output of the three cash crops of cotton, sugar beet, and tobacco accounts for 91.19%, 96.5%, and 81% of the country's total output, respectively.
The development of agricultural mechanization and farmland water conservancy provides huge possibilities for the upsurge of the rural economy.
        Agricultural Mechanization Exceeds Neighboring Countries
        Cultivated Land Area Doubles in Twenty Years
Before liberation, Albanian farmers spent years pulling clumsy wooden plows like cattle and horses. At that time, let alone tractors and harvesters, even an ox or a strong horse was a luxury for farmers. But today, fifteen years after liberation, the country has more than 3,500 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), hundreds of combined harvesters, seeders, threshers, and other agricultural machines. So far, 75% of the country's plowing and threshing work and 50% of the sowing work have been completely mechanized. Calculated on average by cultivated land area, the degree of mechanization of Albanian agriculture in 1957 already exceeded that of neighboring countries. For example, in 1957, Greece had only 2.8 tractors per 1,000 hectares of land, Yugoslavia had only 2.5, and Turkey had only 1.8, while Albania had reached 3.5. This year, Albania has reached 6.8 tractors working on every 1,000 hectares of cultivated land.
In the era of the people's government, Albania carried out large-scale land reclamation, swamp drainage, and water conservancy projects. As a result, the total area of cultivated land in the country increased from more than 220,000 hectares in 1938 to more than 420,000 hectares in 1958, an increase of 96%. Albania has reclaimed more than 11,000 hectares of land in recent years alone. More than 13,000 hectares of former swampland and nearly 55,000 hectares of low-yield land have been transformed into fertile farmland after drainage and improvement. (Attached picture)

    阿尔巴尼亚农业阔步前进
    新华社地拉那20日电　在解放以来的十五年中，阿尔巴尼亚的农业不断迈着巨大的步伐前进，农村经济的面貌已经发生了根本的变化。
      十年来农业发展快
      每年平均增长9％
    据统计，在第一和第二个五年计划（1951—1960年）期间，阿尔巴尼亚的农业生产以每年平均增长
  9％的速度向前发展。同解放前的1938年相比，今年一些主要农作物的产量增长得非常显著。其中，粮食将增长将近二倍半，烟草将增长五倍，棉花将增长十五倍。1958年农业总产值已经增长为1938年的173％，而今年又将比1958年激增26％。
    解放以来，阿尔巴尼亚发展和扩大了农村经济的多种经营，特别是大力种植了经济作物，从而有力地支援着阿尔巴尼亚工业的发展。1938年阿尔巴尼亚的经济作物（主要是烟草）产值，仅占整个农业产值的2％。当时，全国种植棉花的土地仅有二百九十公顷，烟草仅有二千六百公顷；但今天棉花和烟草的播种面积已分别增加了八十一倍半和五倍半以上。棉花和烟草的生产不仅满足了国内工业对原料的需要，而且还可以加工成制成品或半制成品，向国外出口。至于解放后才开始种植的甜菜，它的年产量已经可以用来制糖一万二千多吨。
    牲畜头数按人口平均
    占巴尔干半岛第一位
    阿尔巴尼亚畜牧业也取得了巨大的成绩。现在，按人口平均计算，阿尔巴尼亚的牲畜头数在巴尔干半岛占第一位，绵羊的只数占欧洲第三位。1958年全国平均每三个人就有一头牛，每一个人就有两只羊。牲畜的出肉率和出奶率也在不断提高。阿尔巴尼亚运用有利的地理和气候条件来发展果树栽培和林木业。十五年来，各种果树增加了七倍，葡萄增加了六倍。在这期间，造林面积达到了一万七千多公顷，另有五万七千公顷的森林得到了改良。目前阿尔巴尼亚的森林覆盖的总面积占全国面积的47％，是林木丰富的国家之一，在欧洲仅次于芬兰和瑞典，而居于第三位。按人口平均计算，阿尔巴尼亚每人拥有林木五十三点六立方米。
        社会主义农业已占绝对优势
        合作农户占总农户的69.6％
    农业合作化的迅速发展是阿尔巴尼亚农村经济发生重大变化的一个根本条件。目前，社会主义的农业在阿尔巴尼亚已占绝对优势。根据最新材料，加入农业社的农户已占全国农户的69.6％，实现农业合作化的土地已占全国耕地总面积的81.5％。如果加上国营农场的土地，社会主义农业所拥有的耕地已占全国耕地面积的84％左右。今天，社会主义农业部门的谷物产量已占全国谷物总产量的66.4％，而棉花、甜菜、烟草三种经济作物的产量已分别占全国总产量的91.19％、96.5％和81％。
    农业机械化和农田水利事业的发展为农村经济的高涨提供了巨大的可能性。
        农业机械化程度超过邻国
        耕地面积二十年增加一倍
    解放前，阿尔巴尼亚农民成年累月像牛马一般拉着笨拙的木犁进行耕作，当时不用说拖拉机、收割机，就是一头耕牛、一头壮马对农民也是一种奢望。但在解放十五年后的今天，全国已拥有三千五百多台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算），数百台联合收割机、播种机、打谷机等各种农业机器。到目前，全国75％的耕地和打谷工作，50％的播种工作已经完全机械化了。如果按耕地面积平均计算，在1957年阿尔巴尼亚农业的机械化程度就已超过了邻近的国家。例如，1957年希腊在每一千公顷的土地上只有二点八台拖拉机，南斯拉夫只有二点五台，土耳其只有一点八台，而阿尔巴尼亚已达到三点五台。今年阿尔巴尼亚在每一千公顷耕地上工作的拖拉机已达到了六点八台。
    在人民政权年代中，阿尔巴尼亚进行了大规模的开垦荒地、排干沼泽和兴修水利等工作。结果，全国耕地的总面积从1938年的二十二万多公顷增加到了1958年的四十二万多公顷，即增加了96％。阿尔巴尼亚单是最近几年来就新开垦了一万一千多公顷土地。过去一片沼泽的一万三千多公顷土地和产量低下的近五万五千多公顷土地，经过排干和改良后都变成了肥沃的良田。（附图片）
