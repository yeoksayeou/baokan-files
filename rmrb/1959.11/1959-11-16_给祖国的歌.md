    A Song for the Motherland
    Yan Yi
    A small river flows in my heart,
    Its emotional, clear water sings joyful songs;
    On this great festival, let us ponder:
    Motherland, what is contained in this magnificent word?!
    On my desk lie several maps of the Motherland,
    Some printed in the Qing Dynasty, some in the Republic of China,
    Each time I open them, my heart aches,
    One bloody tragedy after another flashes before my eyes.
    Each map is like an oil painting,
    A beautiful oil painting, yet gnawed by pests,
    English caterpillars, Japanese and American bedbugs,
    Sucking the blood of my Motherland, my people.
    The Qing emperors and Chiang Kai-shek, this gang of tyrants and foreign slaves,
    Wielded the butcher knife in one hand, shackles in the other,
    How many revolutionaries lost their noble lives,
    The butchers fantasizing to extinguish the revolutionary fire with violence.
    The flames of revolution will never be extinguished,
    See, more and more red flags are planted on the map of the Motherland,
    The Communist Party, the savior of our great Motherland,
    Leading the people to open fire on the brutal enemy.
    The great leader Mao Zedong raises the red flag high,
    Leading us to break through the enemy's bunkers one by one,
    Ah! When I unfold the map of our Republic,
    My heart! Is filled with unspeakable joy.
    Good! Those towering Kunlun and Tai Shan peaks,
    The surging Yangtze and Yellow Rivers,
    Are they not like the heroic figures of our Republic,
    Are they not just like our Motherland's leap of a thousand miles!
    Ah! I also recall the days of the Great Leap Forward in steel production,
    Streams of molten steel on the ground, clouds of red in the sky,
    The thought of steel armed every one of our citizens,
    The annual output exceeded the total of fifty years.
    I seem to feel the figure of the Republic suddenly rising,
    Like a heaven-and-earth-supporting giant commanding the great river of steel,
    Waves surging, crashing against the old British broken ship,
    Shortening the journey to surpass Britain by many, many times.
    In the countryside, when I talk heart-to-heart with commune members,
    They point to the grain mountains and say to me:
    This miracle did not fall from the sky,
    It is the people's commune, this one-year-old giant, that conquered the results of the disasters.
    When I gaze at the latest map of the Republic,
    The river of my emotions stirs up raging waves,
    Thousands of factories, mines, power stations, and reservoirs,
    Like chess pieces, fill the colorful chessboard.
    Thousands of roads connect the mountains and plains together,
    Red and green are the colors of the Republic's eternal spring.
    In ten years, we have traveled the road of a thousand years,
    A thousand miles a day, this is our life today.
    Come, let us sing aloud for our beloved Republic,
    Come, let us sing aloud for the life of the Great Leap Forward,
    With the great Party leading the courageous people,
    With the wise Chairman Mao steadily holding the helm.

    给祖国的歌
    雁翼我心里流淌着一条小河，那情感的碧水唱着欢乐的歌；在伟大的节日，让我们思索：祖国，这壮丽的字眼里包含着什么？！我桌案上放着几张祖国的地图，有的印自清代，有的印自民国，每次打开，我的心就疼得发抖，一件件血的惨案又在眼前闪过。一张张地图好像一幅幅油画，美丽的油画却被一条条害虫咬破，英国的毛虫，日本和美国的臭虫，吸食着我的祖国、我的人民的鲜血。清代皇帝与蒋介石这群暴君和洋奴，一手挥着屠刀，一手拿着枷锁，多少革命者失去了高贵的生命，屠夫幻想用暴行扑灭革命烈火。革命的火焰永远不会熄灭，看，祖国地图上的红旗越插越多，共产党，我们伟大祖国的救星，领导着人民向着残暴的敌人开火。伟大的领袖毛泽东高举着红旗，率领着我们把一个个敌人的碉堡攻破，啊！当我展开我们共和国的地图，我的心呵！充满了说不尽的欢乐。好呵！那高高的昆仑和泰山神峰，那汹涌澎湃的扬子江和黄河，不正像我们共和国英雄的身姿，不正如我们祖国一跃千里的气魄！啊！我又忆起了大炼钢铁的日子，地上是钢流万股天上是红云万朵，钢的思想把我们每一个公民武装，一年产量就把五十年总数超过。我仿佛觉得共和国的身姿突然升高，像顶天立地的巨人指挥钢的大河，波涛汹涌，冲击着老牌英国的破船，把超英国的路程又缩短许多许多。在农村，当我和公社社员们谈心，他们指着座座粮山对我讲说：这奇迹不是从天而降，是人民公社，这位刚满一岁的巨人战胜灾旱的结果。当我注视着共和国最新的版图，我情感的河水就掀起狂涛巨澜，千万个工厂、矿山、电站和水库，像棋子摆满了五彩缤纷的棋盘。千条道路把万山和平原联在一起，红红绿绿的是共和国永春的颜色。十年，我们走过了千年的路程，一日千里，这就是我们今日的生活。来，让我们高唱亲爱的共和国，来，让我们高唱大跃进的生活，有伟大的党领导着勇敢的人民，有英明的毛主席稳掌着航舵。
