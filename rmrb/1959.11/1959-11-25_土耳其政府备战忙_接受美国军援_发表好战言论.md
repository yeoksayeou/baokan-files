    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an article exposing the Turkish ruling clique's acceptance of US military aid and stepped-up war preparations.

    The author pointed out that Turkish generals, according to the plans of the aggressive blocs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization, have launched frantic war preparations. The Turkish ruling clique hardly lets a day pass without announcing new steps taken on the dangerous road of militarization.

    Speaking of Turkish Prime Minister Menderes' recent trip to the United States, the author wrote that the Turkish Prime Minister's actions in the United States were mainly to do everything possible to advocate the "Cold War." Every speech he delivered in the United States attempted to slander the Soviet Union's peaceful policies, obstruct cooperation between Eastern countries and socialist countries, and justify the existence of aggressive blocs in Asia. What he called for everywhere was: arm, arm, and arm again!

    土耳其政府备战忙
    接受美国军援　发表好战言论
    新华社讯　据塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：苏联“真理报”发表文章，揭露土耳其统治集团接受美国军事援助，加紧进行备战活动。
    作者指出，土耳其的将领们根据北大西洋公约组织和中央条约组织侵略集团的计划，展开了疯狂的备战活动。土耳其统治集团几乎没有一天不宣布在军国主义化的危险道路上采取的新步骤。
    在谈到土耳其总理曼德列斯不久前的美国之行时，作者写道，土耳其总理在美国的所作所为主要是千方百计地鼓吹“冷战”。他在美国发表的每一次演说，都企图诬蔑苏联的和平政策，阻挠东方国家同社会主义国家加强合作，为亚洲存在侵略集团辩解。他到处号召的是：武装，武装，再武装！
