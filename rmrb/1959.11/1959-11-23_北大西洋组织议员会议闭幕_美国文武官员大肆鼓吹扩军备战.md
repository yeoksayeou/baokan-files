Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 22nd: The fifth annual meeting of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, which began on the 16th, concluded on the 20th in a "cold war" atmosphere, filled with calls to confront the "Communist challenge."

The series of resolutions passed at the meeting reflected their fear of the socialist camp and the forces of peace overwhelming the forces of war, the collapse of the West's "position of strength," and the rising tide of national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Although some resolutions contained phrases expressing "welcome" for the prospect of a summit meeting between East and West and the desire "to achieve broad disarmament as soon as possible," the overriding tone of these resolutions was to clamor for strengthening the North Atlantic bloc and vigorously escalating the "cold war" in the world's intermediate zones.

The speeches of American government officials and representatives set the tone for the meeting. U.S. Secretary of State Herter said in his speech that the United States does not believe that "the common defense work can be relaxed a little because the tension has been eased as a result of Khrushchev's visit (to the United States)." He emphasized that "the United States will continue to fully support NATO" and that "this policy has not changed." He demanded that Western European countries make more "contributions" to the military spending of the North Atlantic bloc. Former Secretary of State Acheson openly opposed negotiations with the Soviet Union on the West Berlin issue and stated that changing the system of Eastern European socialist countries "remains an objective (of the United States)." Admiral Wright, Commander of the Atlantic Fleet of NATO, rehashed the cliché of the Soviet "threat," attempting to intensify anti-Soviet hysteria. U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff White clamored that NATO countries should continue the arms race, emphasizing that NATO's so-called "sword" and "shield" "basic strategy remains unchanged." The newly elected chairman of the meeting, French General Béthouart, also emphasized that the North Atlantic bloc "must not slow down its military efforts."

One resolution passed by the meeting, as in the past, smeared the Eastern European socialist countries as "enslaved nations" and clamored that Western countries should "continue to remain firm" in their hostility towards these socialist countries. A resolution on Berlin stated that "solutions that would damage" West Berlin's "security, freedom, and right to self-determination, as well as all its ties and traffic with the Federal Republic of Germany, cannot be accepted."

Some resolutions passed by the meeting emphasized that "it is increasingly necessary to maintain the unity of Atlantic policies and objectives," which clearly reflected the increasingly fierce political discords and economic conflicts among member states. The meeting advocated that Western heads of government should meet once a year to seek ways to deal with the Soviet Union and ease internal Western contradictions.

The meeting devoted considerable effort to discussing the Western countries' intensified economic expansion and infiltration into underdeveloped countries. U.S. Senator Javits, in his speech, advocated that "if the free world is to win in the Cold War, it must give more economic and technical assistance to the less developed areas." He demanded that other countries share the burden of the United States' "foreign aid." The resolution passed by the meeting's Economic Committee emphasized that member states should "make more efforts than at present" in "developing" underdeveloped areas.

### 北大西洋组织议员会议闭幕  美国文武官员大肆鼓吹扩军备战

    北大西洋组织议员会议闭幕
    美国文武官员大肆鼓吹扩军备战
    据新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：从16日开始的北大西洋公约组织议员会议第五届年会20日在一片叫嚷对付“共产主义挑战”的“冷战”声中闭幕。
    会议通过的一系列决议反映了他们对于社会主义阵营和和平力量压倒战争势力，西方“实力地位”破产，和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族独立运动高涨的恐惧。尽管在个别决议中有表示“欢迎”东西方举行最高级会议的前景和“要尽早实现广泛裁军”的词句，但是这些决议压倒一切的基调却是叫嚷加强北大西洋集团，并且大力在世界中间地带加剧“冷战”。
    美国政府官员和代表们的发言打下了会议的基调。美国国务卿赫脱在发言时说，美国并不认为，“由于赫鲁晓夫访问（美国）的结果缓和了紧张局势，就可以把共同防务工作放松一些”。他强调“美国将继续全力支持北大西洋公约组织”，“这种政策没有改变”。他要求西欧国家对北大西洋集团的军事开支作出更多“贡献”。前国务卿艾奇逊公然反对就西柏林问题同苏联谈判，并且表示改变东欧社会主义国家的制度“仍然是（美国的）一个目的”。北大西洋公约组织大西洋舰队司令赖特重弹苏联“威胁”的滥调，力图加剧反苏歇斯底里。美国空军参谋长怀特叫嚷北大西洋公约组织国家要继续进行军备竞赛，他强调说，北大西洋公约组织的所谓“剑”和“盾”的“基本战略仍然未变。”新当选的会议主席、法国的贝图阿将军也强调北大西洋集团“决不能放慢它的军事努力”。
    会议通过的一个决议仍然同过去一样地诬蔑东欧社会主义国家是“被奴役国家”，并且叫嚷西方国家在敌视这些社会主义国家方面要“继续保持坚定”。在有关柏林的一个决议中说，“不能接受将损害”西柏林的“安全、自由和自决权以及它同德意志联邦共和国的一切联系和交通的解决办法”。
    会议通过的一些决议强调“越来越有必要保持大西洋政策和目的的统一”，这显然反映了各成员国的政治龃龉和经济冲突日益激烈。会议主张西方政府首脑每年聚会一次，以谋求应付苏联和缓和西方内部矛盾的途径。
    会议以很大力量讨论了西方国家加紧向不发达国家进行经济扩张和渗入的问题。美国参议员杰维茨在发言时鼓吹“自由世界要在冷战中得胜，就必须给予比较不发达地区以更多的经济和技术援助”。他要求其他国家分担美国的“援外”担子。会议的经济委员会通过的决议强调要会员国在“发展”不发达地区方面要“作出比目前更多的努力”。
