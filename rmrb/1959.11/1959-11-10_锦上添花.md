Adding Flowers to Brocade
Liu Song

Recently, I went to a people's commune to listen to the opinions of the commune members. They talked about many benefits of the people's commune, and finally summed it up in one sentence: the people's commune is "adding flowers to brocade."

Please listen to the examples given by the commune members: "Things that the advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives couldn't do before can be done now; advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives can increase production; people's communes can harvest more grain"; this is "adding flowers to brocade." "The advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives had no industry before, but now they do"; this is "adding flowers to brocade." "Although life was good before, women stayed at home all day, revolving around the stove, and sometimes there were inevitable arguments between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. Now that they have joined the canteen and are all participating in labor, the relationship between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law is also harmonious, and family life is getting better and better," this is also "adding flowers to brocade." The broad masses of peasants sing: "Communism is heaven, and the people's commune is the bridge." Indeed, the people's commune is the best organizational form for our country to transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people, and from socialism to communism. It is a great bridge.

The "brocade" of collective ownership, adding the "flower" of ownership by the whole people; the "brocade" of socialist society, adding the "flower" of communist buds; this is completely in line with the requirements of historical development, and is completely in line with the real interests of the broad masses and their pursuit of future ideals. Have those who think that people's communes are "superfluous" ever heard these opinions?

    锦上添花
    柳松
    最近，到一个人民公社去听了听社员们的议论，他们说了许多人民公社的好处，最后归结成一句：人民公社是“锦上添花”。
    请听听社员们举出的例证吧：“原来高级社办不了的事，现在能办了；高级社能增产；人民公社能打更多的粮食”；这是“锦上添花”。“原来高级社没工业，现在有了”；这是“锦上添花”。“从前生活虽然不错，但妇女整天在家围锅台转，有时免不了婆媳吵两句，现在入了食堂，都出来参加劳动了，婆媳之间也和睦了，家庭生活越来越好了”，这又是“锦上添花”。广大农民歌唱道：“共产主义是天堂，人民公社是桥梁。”的确，人民公社是我国由社会主义集体的所有制过渡到社会主义全民所有制、由社会主义过渡到共产主义的最好组织形式，是一座伟大的桥梁。
    集体所有制之“锦”，添全民所有制成分之“花”，社会主义社会之“锦”，添共产主义萌芽之“花”，这完全是符合历史发展要求的，是完全符合广大群众现实利益和对将来理想的追求的。那些认为人民公社是“多此一举”的人，可曾听到过这些议论吗？
