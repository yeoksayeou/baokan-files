Two Rooms
Kang Yousheng

My dad and my mom live in the rural people's commune, occupying two rooms. One room is where my dad and mom live, and the other has a lock on the door all year round. Nobody lives there, and I can't figure out what it's for. My brother and I live in the city. Time flies, and I'll be graduating from junior high school this summer vacation.

The month before last, Dad sent a letter asking me to take a Sunday and visit him. I couldn't figure out why. My sister-in-law just said, "Maybe it's to give you a vaccination." This made me even more puzzled.

That day, I got up early. Leaving the city gate, the sky was still dimly lit, and I went straight home. I saw my dad sweeping the yard. Dad told me to rest and Mom made me breakfast. I guessed it must be that the commune was short of labor and wanted me to come and work. After breakfast, Dad didn't send me to work. I was just speculating when Dad spoke:

"Yi'er, come here." I followed him close to that locked room. As soon as the door opened, a musty and stinky dampness hit my face, and I couldn't help but take a step back. The room was dark, small, and low. Walking into the room, I couldn't even raise my head. Dad said to me, "Take a good look. Your dad and your brother both grew up in this room." I felt like my eyes were blinded by dust, and I gently rubbed them. I saw: right inside the door was the stove, next to the stove was a row of earthen bed, with a small pile of wheat stalks scattered at the corner of the bed. Next to the wheat stalks was a quilt full of patches, the color of a rag. Next to the bed, on the ground, was a broken water tank. Dad said this was used to store food in previous years. Going into the room to the right, next to the broken tank, opposite the bed, was a long table, the four legs of which were already leaning in different directions, tied together with ropes, the fine and the thick intertwined, so that it was impossible to tell which was the end and which was the beginning. Under the table was a long bench, already a three-legged cripple. The surface of the bench clearly showed knife and ax marks, and the large and small mottled marks left by the children's playfulness, indicating that it and its owner had spent a long and severe time together. In the center of the table, against the wall, was the place for the shrine. The merciful and compassionate Goddess of Mercy stood upright in the small shrine, still calm and composed. In front of the shrine was an incense burner, the remaining ashes and dust mixed together. On the right side of the shrine was an earthenware jar, the lid of which already had a slight crack. Dad said that this was brought by his great-grandmother as part of her dowry. Next to the earthenware jar stood a basket of bowls, stained with dust and covered in wounds. It is said that Mom still wanted to use it, but because it leaked when filled with water, Dad picked it up and put it here. On the left side of the shrine, a chipped small bowl was placed diagonally on a wooden block used as a lamp stand. A small section of lampwick, like thin vermicelli, extended from the blackened bowl center to the broken bowl mouth. The charred lamp wick rested outside the bowl, as if it had completed its historical journey and now needed only rest.

I was tired of looking, and the musty smell made me unable to breathe. I said, "Let's go out, Dad." Dad didn't say a word, standing there blankly, as if thinking about something. After a while, he told me to take a closer look again. I looked at the four walls. The walls were made of earth blocks, and it seemed that at some time, large patches had peeled off. The low roof was blackened by smoke, and strands of withered grain stalks hung from the sorghum stalks from top to bottom. The wind blowing in from outside the door made them sway gently, making a faint "rustling" sound. I turned to go out, and only then did I realize that the room had no windows. The light shining in from outside the door actually made me squint.

Dad was locking the door. I stood behind him, looking at the half "福" (fortune) character in the center of the door frame. I thought, "This is considered 'fortune'!"

We walked towards the new house. Mom held a small broom for sweeping the bed and stopped us at the door, insisting that we do some cleaning work before letting us in.

The new house was spacious and bright, with thick brick walls and thick beams, which looked very strong. The sunlight shone through the window glass, obliquely illuminating the bed. Two thick floral cotton quilts looked particularly comfortable and warm. The alarm clock was singing "tick-tock." Mom was busy by the stove, preparing to make something delicious for her son.

Dad told me to come to him and said, "Yi'er, you've seen it all. I don't remember the rest. For three generations, our ancestors have been hired laborers. They worked hard day and night, and all they earned was in that room." Dad paused, took a puff of smoke, and continued, "It's only been ten years since the founding of the new country, and our family's situation is getting better day by day. Yi'er, you are young, and you've caught up with good times. People can't forget their roots! We must always think about who is leading us upwards... After lunch, go back to school."

The scenery in the suburbs was charming, but I was in no mood to appreciate it. Dad's words, sister-in-law's words, the two rooms, all flooded my mind... I unconsciously quickened my pace, and soon returned to school.

    两间屋
    康有声
    我爹和我娘住在郊区人民公社里，占了两间屋，一间我爹和娘住着，另一间门上常年挂上把锁，也没个人住，也弄不清作啥用？我跟我哥住在城里。日子过得飞快，暑假我就初中毕业了。
    前个月，爹捎信来，叫我抽个礼拜天，到他那去一趟。我摸不透为啥，我嫂只说：“不定是给你打防疫针哩。”这一说，我更摸不着头脑。
    那天，我起了个大早，出了城门，天尚蒙蒙亮，径直往家走，看到我爹在扫院子。爹叫我歇歇，娘给我做饭吃。我估摸准是社里劳动力缺乏，叫我来出工咧。吃罢早饭，爹没打发我去干活，我正揣测，爹开口了：
    “宜儿，你来。”我跟着他走近那间上锁的屋子。门一打开，就有一股又霉又臭的湿气扑脸而来，我不禁倒退了一步。房间里黑洞洞的，又小又矮，走进屋里，头都抬不起来。爹对我说：“你仔细看看吧，你爹你哥都在这屋里长大的。”我像是被灰尘迷住了眼，用手轻轻揉了揉，只见：一进门就是锅灶，挨着锅灶是一溜土炕，炕角散乱着一小堆麦秆，麦秆旁边是一条满是补钉、色似抹布的盖被。紧挨着炕，地上搁了个破水缸，爹说这是往年装口粮用的。进屋往右，挨着破缸，和炕相对安着一张长桌，四条桌腿已东倒西斜，下面捆绑了绳子，细的和粗的交杂缠绕在一起，已分不清绳头绳尾。桌下横着一条条凳，已成了三只脚的跛子，凳面明显的露出刀斧印，和由于孩子的顽皮所留下的大大小小斑驳痕迹，说明了它和它的主人，共同度过长久的严峻的岁月。桌面正中靠墙是安放神位的地方，大慈大悲的观音菩萨端立在小神盦里，依然潇洒自若。神位面前放着一只顶足香炉，残剩的香灰和尘埃混淆在一堆。在神位的右侧，有一个土制陶器罐，罐盖已经有一道曲度不大的裂痕，爹说这还是曾祖母陪嫁带来的。紧挨土罐，一萝被尘土涂染成混色的伤迹累累的碗，立在那里。据说娘还要使它，就是因为盛上水就漏了，被爹拾掇到这儿来了。神位左侧，一只缺口的小碗，斜放在做灯架用的木块上，一小段像细粉丝似的灯草，由污黑的碗心延伸至破缺的碗口，焦黑的灯芯搭在碗外，仿佛它已完成了自己的历史行程，现在所需要的，只是休息。
    我看得累了，又被霉臭味熏得出不了气，说：“出去吧，爹。”爹没吱声，呆呆的立着，像在思考什么。隔了一会，又叫我仔细看看。我打量了一下四壁，墙是用土块砌的，不知从什么时候起，已经一大片一大片地剥落下土来。低矮的屋顶，被烟熏的发黑，一根根枯色的谷草透过高粱秆，由上至下地吊着，从门外吹来的风，使它轻摇慢晃，发出“瑟瑟”的微声。我转身向外，这才发觉屋子是没有窗户的，从门外射进来的光亮，竟使我不由地迷起了眼。
    爹在锁门，我立在他老人家背后，望着门框上面正中那半个“福”字，我想：“这也算‘福’咧！”
    我们走向新屋，娘手里拿了把扫炕的小帚，在门口拦着我们，非要我们做番清洁工作，才让进屋。
    新屋是宽敞、亮堂的，厚厚的砖墙和粗大的房梁，显得十分壮实。阳光透过窗玻璃，斜照炕头，两床厚实的花棉被，显得格外惬意、温暖；闹钟在“的?的?”欢唱；娘在锅灶旁边忙着，准备为儿子做点好吃的。
    爹叫我到他跟前，说：“宜儿，你全看到啦，旁的我记不清了，咱祖上三代，都是给人扛长工的，黑天白日，累死干活，挣的全在那屋里了。”爹顿了顿，抽一口烟，接着说：“打新国家成立那年起，才过了十年，咱家的光景是一天强似一天。宜儿，你小小年纪，赶上好日月啦。人不能忘本！要经常想想这是谁领着咱往上走的……吃了中饭，你回学校去吧。”
    郊外的景色是迷人的，可是我的心情却无暇顾及。爹的话，嫂的话，两间屋，一古脑儿涌上心头……。我不知不觉地加快了脚步，没有多大一会就回到了学校。（附图片）
