Introduction to the Dongfanghong Tractor
    Wang Zhaoxun

    The "Dongfanghong" tractor produced by the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant belongs to the category of heavy-duty crawler agricultural tractors.

    The "Dongfanghong" is equipped with a 54-horsepower four-cylinder high-speed diesel engine. The fastest speed on a flat road is 7.9 kilometers per hour. The power on the drawbar when tilling is 36 horsepower, and the fuel consumption per horsepower per hour is 220 grams. This tractor is not only highly productive and fuel-efficient, but also has a solid structure, fewer failures during use, simple maintenance, and easy operation. Routine maintenance work can generally be completed within half an hour. In the steering control structure, the separation of the clutch plates and the braking of the brakes are controlled separately, which saves operating force and reduces the fatigue of the driver. Therefore, it is superior both in terms of performance and economic efficiency.

    This tractor can be used for plowing, cultivating, harrowing, sowing, harvesting, shallow plowing for peeling, and processing agricultural products. In addition to working in conjunction with mobile machinery such as combine harvesters, it can also be used for stationary work, such as pumping water, generating electricity, artificial rainfall, and driving processing machines such as chaff cutters.

    东方红牌拖拉机介绍
    王昭巽
    第一拖拉机制造厂出产的“东方红”拖拉机，属于重型链轨式农业拖拉机的一类。
    “东方红”装有五十四马力的四汽缸高速柴油发动机，在平路上行驶的最快速度每小时是七点九公里，耕地时挂钩上的功率为三十六马力，每马力每小时耗油二百二十克。这种拖拉机不仅生产效率高，耗油量少，而且结构坚固，使用时故障少，保养简单，操作简便。班次保养工作，一般半小时内就可做完。在转向操纵结构中，把分离器片的分离和制动器的制动分开操纵，节约了操纵力量，减轻了驾驶员的劳累。因此，不论在使用性能上还是经济性能上，都是比较优越的。
    这种拖拉机可以翻地、耘土、耙土、播种、收割、浅耕去皮和农产品加工。除了与移动的机械，如联合收割机等联合工作外，还可以用在固定工作上，像抽水、发电、人工降雨和带动铡草机等加工机器工作。
