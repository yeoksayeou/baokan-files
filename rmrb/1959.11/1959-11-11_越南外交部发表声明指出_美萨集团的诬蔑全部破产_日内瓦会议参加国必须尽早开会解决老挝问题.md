Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today regarding the report of the United Nations Security Council's "Committee of Inquiry into the Situation in Laos." The full text is as follows:

The "Committee of Inquiry into the Situation in Laos" of the United Nations Security Council published its report on November 6th, which it had submitted on November 3rd.

As everyone knows, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly stated that the establishment of the so-called "Committee of Inquiry" by the United Nations Security Council and its dispatch to Laos are illegal. This is a conspiracy by U.S. imperialism to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for invading Laos and to use this as a pretext to, under the guise of the United Nations, undermine the Geneva Agreements on Laos and further interfere in Laos. However, despite the "Committee of Inquiry" staying in Laos for four weeks and relying solely on unfounded materials provided by the Laotian authorities, it still could not cover up the truth about the situation in Laos. The "Committee of Inquiry" had to admit in its report: "Generally speaking, military activities are of a guerrilla nature and are carried out sporadically on the territory of the Kingdom," "The hostile elements appear to be members of the Second Battalion, Seventh Company of the Pathet Lao forces and ethnic minorities in the border areas," "All the materials provided to the Committee by the Lao Government are insufficient to prove that regular troops of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have crossed the border."

Obviously, the slanders blatantly carried out by U.S. imperialism and the pro-American elements in the Sananikone government against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have completely failed. The Lao Royal Government's letter to the United Nations on September 4th, falsely accusing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of sending troops to attack Lao troops, and the statement issued by the U.S. State Department on September 5th, have also completely failed. The vile faces of U.S. imperialism, the Sananikone government, and the leaders of the Lao "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," who specialize in provocation and slander, have been exposed to world public opinion.

However, U.S. imperialism and the Lao authorities, having reached a dead end and unable to find a pretext to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for "direct aggression" against Laos, have resorted to despicable means, attempting to accuse the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of "assisting the former Pathet Lao forces" from abroad. At the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Lao authorities have provided the "Committee of Inquiry" with so-called "witnesses and material evidence." According to a report by "Lao Patriotic News" on October 28, 1959, during an anti-"sweep," the Lao people seized an order signed by Colonel Amkha Soukhavong on September 23 of this year, which ordered all units to "report that the attacked locations were attacked by the Viet Minh, and that they had personally seen the Viet Minh, personally heard Vietnamese spoken, or seen people wearing Viet Minh army uniforms; all levels must find witnesses and teach them how to provide testimony..." Thus, the "Committee of Inquiry's" report recorded the unfounded "testimonies" of pre-arranged "witnesses" Taseng, Nai Boon, and certain soldiers of the Lao Royal Army, as well as "some wounded soldiers," thereby drawing the very vague conclusion that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had reinforced the former Pathet Lao forces with weapons, ammunition, food, supplies, and cadres. The Lao authorities also presented some material evidence, such as guns manufactured in the United States, Czechoslovakia, France, China, etc., before 1953, ammunition of unknown origin, U.S.-made mortar shells, and medical syringes with Chinese, Vietnamese, and Lao characters with unclear manufacturing dates. Everyone knows that Laos was a battlefield where various weapons, ammunition, and military supplies were shipped in during the Indochina War, which ended in 1954. Therefore, the "Committee of Inquiry's" intention in recording the above-mentioned matters in its report is nothing more than to salvage the slanderous conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the pro-American elements in the Sananikone government, which has already failed.

There is no doubt that the "Committee of Inquiry's" report on the situation in Laos is worthless and has no legal basis.

The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly stated that the profound roots and direct causes of the current serious situation in Laos are U.S. imperialism's interference in Laos, their attempt to turn Laos into a U.S. military base, prepare for a new war in Indochina, and threaten peace in Southeast Asia and the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Currently, U.S. imperialism is still vigorously shipping its military personnel, weapons, and military supplies into Laos, instigating the Sananikone government and the leaders of the so-called Lao "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" to intensify the suppression and persecution of Lao patriots, illegally detain and prepare to try Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, and continue to expand the civil war in Laos, making the situation in Laos increasingly tense. U.S. imperialism and the Lao authorities are also attempting to maintain the activities of the "Committee of Inquiry" and request the United Nations to send representatives to be stationed permanently in Laos, so that they can exclude the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos and further undermine the Geneva Agreements on Laos.

The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam once again declares that the only way to solve the Laotian issue and normalize the situation in Laos is to respect and thoroughly implement the Geneva Agreements on Laos and the Vientiane Agreements; the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos must resume its activities, and any measures outside the scope of the Geneva Agreements on Laos will not only fail to solve any problems but will further complicate the Laotian issue.

The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly opposes the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the Sananikone government to establish a permanent United Nations body in Laos in any form.

The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam demands that the U.S. government immediately cease its acts of interference in Laos and demands that the Sananikone government immediately stop the civil war and restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front who have been illegally detained.

The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam emphasizes that: In the current situation, when the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos has not yet resumed its activities, in order to resolve the Laotian issue, a conference of the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina, as suggested by the Soviet government on September 14, 1959, must be convened as soon as possible; the Lao International Commission should report the results of its activities to the conference and propose necessary measures to promote the normalization of the situation in Laos.

    越南外交部发表声明指出
    美萨集团的诬蔑全部破产
    日内瓦会议参加国必须尽早开会解决老挝问题
    新华社河内10日电　越南民主共和国外交部今天就联合国安全理事会“调查老挝局势小组委员会”的报告发表声明，全文如下：
    联合国安全理事会“调查老挝局势小组委员会”11月6日公布了它在11月3日提出的报告。
    众所周知，越南民主共和国政府曾经多次声明，联合国安全理事会成立所谓“调查小组委员会”，并且派遣它到老挝去，是非法的。这是美帝国主义企图诬蔑越南民主共和国侵略老挝的阴谋，并以此为借口，盗用联合国的名义来破坏关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议和进一步干涉老挝。可是，尽管“调查小组委员会”赖在老挝四星期，而且只依靠老挝当局提供的毫无根据的材料，它仍然掩盖不了老挝局势的真相。“调查小组委员会”在它的报告里不得不承认：“一般的说，军事活动带着游击性质，而且是在王国领土上零星地进行的”，“敌对分子似乎是寮国战斗部队第二营第七连成员和边界地区的少数民族人民”，“老挝政府提供小组委员会的全部材料不足以证实越南民主共和国的正规部队已经越境”。
    显然，美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府中的亲美分子一直明目张胆地对越南民主共和国进行的诬蔑已经全部破产。老挝王国政府在9月4日写给联合国的诬蔑越南民主共和国派遣部队进攻老挝军队的信和美国国务院9月5日发表的声明也全部破产了。美帝国主义、萨纳尼空政府和老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们专以挑衅和诬蔑为能事的卑劣嘴脸已在全世界舆论面前暴露无遗。
    但是，已经进了死胡同的美帝国主义和老挝当局，在它们无法找到诬蔑越南民主共和国“直接侵略”老挝的口实的情况下，竟又采取了可耻的手段，企图加罪越南民主共和国从国外“帮助前寮国战斗部队”。在美帝国主义的唆使下，老挝当局已经为“调查小组委员会”提供了所谓“人证和物证”。据1959年10月28日“老挝爱国新闻”报道，在一次反“扫荡”中，老挝人民缴获了庵卡·苏卡冯大校今年9月23日签署的命令，它命令各部队单位“必须报告说，被进攻的地点是受到越盟进攻的，并且亲眼看到了越盟，亲耳听到了越南话，或者说看到穿越盟军队制服的人，各级必须找到人证，教给他们怎样提出供词……”。这样，“调查小组委员会”的报告便记录下了事先布置好的“人证”塔生、耐本和老挝王国军队某些士兵以及“一些伤员”的毫无根据的“供词”，从而作出非常含糊的结论说，越南民主共和国已经向前寮国战斗部队增援武器、弹药、粮食、军需品和干部。老挝当局还提出一些物证，如美国、捷克斯洛伐克、法国、中国等在1953年以前制造的枪支，来历不明的弹药、美制迫击炮弹，制造日期不清楚的、有中国、越南、老挝等国文字的医药注射器。大家都知道，在1954年结束的印度支那战争中，老挝是曾经被运进多种武器、弹药和军用品的战场。因此，“调查小组委员会”在报告中记载着上述事情的用意，不外是为了挽救已经破产的美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府中的亲美分子的诬蔑阴谋。
    不容怀疑，“调查小组委员会”关于老挝局势的报告是毫无价值的，是没有法理根据的。
    越南民主共和国政府曾经多次声明，老挝目前严重局势的深远根源和直接原因是美帝国主义对老挝的干涉，他们企图把老挝变为美国的军事基地，在印度支那准备新的战争，威胁东南亚和平和越南民主共和国的安全。目前，美帝国主义仍然大力把它们的军事人员、武器和军用物资运进老挝，唆使萨纳尼空政府和所谓老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们加强对老挝爱国者进行镇压和迫害，并非法拘禁和准备审判苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人，继续扩大老挝内战，使老挝局势愈来愈紧张。美帝国主义和老挝当局还企图维持“调查小组委员会”的活动，并要求联合国派遣代表常驻老挝，以便他们排除老挝国际监督和监察委员会，进而破坏关于老挝的日内瓦协议。
    越南民主共和国政府再一次声明，解决老挝问题，使老挝局势正常化的唯一途径是必须尊重和彻底实行关于老挝的日内瓦协议和万象协议；老挝国际监督和监察委员会必须恢复活动，在关于老挝的日内瓦协议范围以外的任何措施不但解决不了任何问题，反而使老挝问题更加复杂化。
    越南民主共和国政府坚决反对美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府企图以任何形式在老挝设立联合国常设机构的阴谋。
    越南民主共和国政府要求美国政府立即停止对老挝的干涉行为，并要求萨纳尼空政府立即停止内战，恢复被非法拘禁的苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的自由。
    越南民主共和国政府强调指出：在目前情况下，在老挝国际监督和监察委员会尚未恢复活动的时候，为解决老挝问题起见，必须越早越好地召开苏联政府在1959年9月14日所建议的1954年关于印度支那的日内瓦会议参加国会议；老挝国际委员会应向会议报告自己的活动结果，并提出促使老挝局势正常化的必要措施。
