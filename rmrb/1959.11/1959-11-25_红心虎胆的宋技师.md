    Song, the Technician with a Red Heart and Tiger Courage
    Yang Zhemin
    When the curtain rises, we only see a few workers buying scrap copper and tin, and they have to wait until the tin alloy is refined to sell it for money before they can pay the sellers. Then, the surveyors from the neighboring soda factory, who are expanding their plant buildings, are driving stakes and drawing lines on the very spot where they stand, because they simply don't know that there is a locally-run tin alloy factory here. Then we see Factory Director Guan of the alloy factory with a strange red cloth bag tied around his waist. It turns out that they don't have an office, and this is his safe. When a buyer from another factory comes to order goods and asks to visit the workshop, we realize that the small broken mat shed next to the wall of the soda factory is the alloy factory's workshop. And all that this factory owns is a spoon, two pots, three molds, and four people. Here, the author of "Red Heart and Tiger Courage" uses such concise, very lifelike, and generalizing strokes to present us with the scene of many factories starting from scratch in the early days of socialist construction in our country.
    However, not everyone can be inspired with fighting enthusiasm when facing this situation of being poor and blank. The alloy factory, due to a lack of funds and small sales of its products, had one of its only four workers leave, rolling up his bedding, because he couldn't get paid on time and couldn't see a great future for the factory. And when everyone is anxiously waiting for the purchasing agent, who finally graces them with his presence, to say the order quantity, he only says: Let's try making one and a half catties first! People are also a little discouraged. But in the midst of these difficulties, we see Technician Song decisively persuade everyone to immediately refine that one and a half catties of tin alloy for the factory, thereby securing large orders and enabling the alloy factory to stand on its own. Then, we see that when the district industrial department assigns them the task of trial-producing important metals, Factory Director Guan, in order to maintain the factory's existing achievements, is unwilling to "take risks" again. But Technician Song immediately advocates accepting this trial-production task, shouting the heroic and firm slogan of "Even if the factory loses money, we must do it!" and immediately leads everyone to devote themselves to the battle by all means and without fear of any obstacles, and they successfully trial-produce the metal. Under the leadership of Technician Song, this alloy factory has finally developed into a modern factory capable of producing more than 270 products. We can't help but be deeply moved by Technician Song's daring and capable revolutionary spirit and the high degree of Party spirit with which he sees the needs of the entire socialist construction at all times and in all places.
    I think the shortcomings of this script are that the character of Technician Song is interrupted in the last two scenes, and the dramatic conflict surrounding him is pushed behind the scenes, and the theme of the script suddenly turns to love and morality. The wavering of Technician Song at the end of the fifth scene is also not very consistent with the logic of the character's ideological development. In addition, I also feel that the author's grasp of Factory Director Guan's character is still somewhat uncertain, and the ideological process of Technician Wei's development from individualism to sabotaging the experiment is not written fully and convincingly enough. But we believe that this play will be further improved in constant stage practice.

    红心虎胆的宋技师
    杨哲民
    当幕布打开时，我们只看到几个工人在收买破铜烂锡，并且还要等炼出锡合金来，卖了钱，才能付款给卖主；跟着，隔壁汽水厂扩建厂房的测量工人，又在他们站脚的地方钉起橛子，划起线来，因为他根本就不知道这儿还有一个地方国营的锡合金厂；然后我们又看到，合金厂关厂长在腰里竟系了一个奇怪的红布口袋，原来他们没有办公室，这就是他的保险柜了；等另一个厂的采购员来订货，并要求参观一下车间时，我们才知道汽水厂旁边墙角里的小破席棚，就是合金厂的厂房了；而这个工厂的全部所有，也就是一把勺子，两口锅，三个模子，四个人而已。这里，“红心虎胆”的作者仅仅用了这么简洁的、极有生活气息、富有概括力的几笔，就给我们呈现了我国社会主义建设初期，许多工厂建设中的这种白手起家的情景。
    但是，并不是所有的人面对这种一穷二白的情景，都能够激起战斗的热情的。合金厂由于缺乏资金，产品销路小，在仅有的四个人当中，又有一个工人因为不能按月领到工资，看不见工厂的伟大前途，就卷起铺盖卷儿走了。而当大家急切地等待着那个好容易光临的采购员说出订货数字时，他只说：先试制一斤半吧！人们也有些泄劲儿了。但就在这重重困难包围中，我们却看到宋技师当机立断地说服了大家，立刻去为这个厂炼那一斤半锡合金，从而争取了大批订货，使合金厂立住了脚跟。接着，我们又看到，当区工业部把重要金属试制任务交给他们的时候，关厂长为了保持厂子既有的成绩，不愿再去“冒险”了，可是宋技师却立即主张接受这个试制任务，喊出了“即使厂子赔钱也要干”的豪迈而又坚定的口号，并且立刻带领大家千方百计、不畏一切险阻地投入了战斗，而且试制成功了。这个合金厂，在宋技师的领导下，终于发展成能生产二百七十多种产品的现代化大工厂了，我们不能不为宋技师的敢想敢干的革命气魄，和那种随时随地都看到整个社会主义建设需要的高度党性所深深地激动。
    我觉得这个剧本的不足之处，在于最后两场戏宋技师这个人物中断了，围绕着他所展开的戏剧冲突也推到幕后去了，剧本的主题忽然转到恋爱道德上去。五场末尾宋技师的动摇，也不很符合这个人物思想发展的逻辑。另外，还感到作者对关厂长的性格还有些把握不定，对魏技师由个人主义发展到破坏试验的思想过程，写得不够充分、可信。但我们相信，这个戏在不断的舞台实践之中，一定会使它更臻完善的。
