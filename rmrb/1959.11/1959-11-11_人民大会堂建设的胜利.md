The Victory of the Construction of the Great Hall of the People

Liu Zhixian, Deputy Manager of Beijing First Construction Engineering Company

Under the radiant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and with the vigorous support of the people of the whole country, our company's entire staff, with soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, constructed the Great Hall of the People in a manner that was more, faster, better, and more economical.

The Great Hall of the People is 336 meters long from north to south, with a maximum height of 46 meters at the central part, covering an area of 171,800 square meters, exceeding the total effective construction area of the entire Forbidden City. The entire building consists of three main parts: the Great Auditorium, which can accommodate 10,000 people, the Banquet Hall with 5,000 seats, and the office building of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The Great Hall is equipped with various modern facilities. There are air conditioners that can adjust the indoor temperature and humidity at any time; there are high-pressure steam and gas; there is a simultaneous interpretation system capable of translating twelve languages; and there are mechanical and electrical equipment for sound amplification, broadcasting, telecommunications, television, and filming. The structure of the building is very complex. There are reinforced concrete columns, two meters square and forty-five meters high, bearing more than 3,000 tons; there are reinforced concrete beams, nine meters high and thirty-four meters long; there are steel roof trusses with a span of more than sixty meters; there are large steel beams weighing 141 tons; and there are large cantilevered platforms with steel beams extending sixteen meters. The volume of work for this project is also very large: more than 430,000 cubic meters of earthwork, more than 127,000 cubic meters of reinforced concrete, more than 670 kilometers of lighting wires and cables, and 45 kilometers of power wires and cables...

Such a large-scale and technically complex project, from the initial drafting of the design plan in mid-September last year, commencing construction on October 28th, was fully completed in just over ten months by the end of August this year. The inspection and acceptance by the Great Hall of the People Project Acceptance Committee proved that the quality is excellent.

Conducting Mass Movements on a Large Scale

This project was carried out with simultaneous design, preparation, and construction. In order to closely cooperate with the construction, more than 150 designers were stationed on-site, going deep among the masses to carry out design work. Whether the work was familiar or unfamiliar, the worker comrades obeyed the assignments as long as the project needed it, diligently studied and learned, creatively solved many complex technical problems, and overcame the difficulties caused by the serious shortage of technical workers. In their work, they did not talk about remuneration, competing to undertake the most arduous tasks. Wherever there were leading processes and key parts, wherever there were weak links, they took the initiative to support each other. This communist labor attitude of the vast majority of workers is one of the most basic guarantees for the successful completion of this project.

In order to save time, we started construction immediately the day after we received the first drawings. Machinery and manpower were deployed simultaneously, workers and cadres all pitched in, and thousands of people who came to the construction site to participate in voluntary labor were all involved in the great battle of excavating earthwork. When we dug to a depth of five meters, we encountered an ancient riverbed from the Liao-Jin era. Therefore, the worker comrades fought day and night against the black and smelly silt, excavating 350,000 cubic meters of earthwork in one month, laying the concrete foundation, and winning the victory of the first battle.

In late March, the battle of hoisting steel roof trusses began inside the Great Auditorium. Hoisting twelve steel roof trusses, each more than sixty meters long, seven meters high, and weighing more than fifty tons, to a height of more than forty meters encountered one difficulty after another. A large number of experienced hoisting workers and technicians were transferred from Fularji, Baotou, Taiyuan, Jiuquan, and other places, and they fought side by side with the hoisting workers in Beijing. After repeated research, a method of lifting from both ends of the steel beams with two derrick masts was adopted. The steel roof truss had only just been lifted off the ground when, due to the excessive span and insufficient rigidity, horizontal bending occurred, and two test hoists failed. The construction period controlled by the comprehensive progress plan was greatly delayed, and people's moods were heavy and anxious. This was a decisive moment. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the "three-way combination" meeting was held again, and leading cadres, workers, technicians, and designers repeatedly studied the problem and finally decided to use steel supports for reinforcement. Upon receiving the notice to make steel supports, the design and processing departments designed and processed them overnight, and installed them in two days and two nights. The third test hoist was successful. Once again, the difficulties were successfully overcome.

After the steel roof trusses and the steel beams of the two-story platforms were hoisted, it was already May, and there were only three months left until the completion date. Most of the projects had entered the decoration stage. However, inside the Great Auditorium, concrete had to be poured for the two-story platforms, and three layers of large and small frameworks had to be nailed on top, and the "sky and water blend into one color" ceiling had to be nailed to the framework; all the ground work, from backfilling sand and gravel and building ground walls to laying the floor, had not yet begun; a large number of ceiling, plastering, painting, lighting fixtures, tables and chairs, cooling and heating air, simultaneous interpretation, television, photography lighting, sound amplification system and other equipment installation projects, dozens of tasks up and down were urgently waiting to be carried out. Whether all these tasks could be completed thoroughly in just three months became the most important and urgent key point at that time.

The Party committee of the construction site analyzed the situation at that time and convened a mass meeting to rely on the collective wisdom of the masses to solve such a problem: how to make full use of time and space in the arc-shaped Great Auditorium so that complex processes in the sky, underground, and around can be carried out simultaneously in three-dimensional cross and parallel flow operations?

Under the inspiration of the Party committee, the scaffolders, together with the technicians, gave full play to their high wisdom, calculated the position of the star-like lamp holes on the ceiling, cleverly passed the lamp rings, inserted one non-grounded fir pole after another from the steel beams, and then went down the pole to hang in the air more than thirty meters above the ground to tie the horizontal "downward water" fir poles. The workers launched a face-to-face competition in such a thrilling and tense labor. As a result, the entire ceiling and under the two-story platforms were built with aerial scaffolding, turning the entire Great Auditorium into eight-story operation platform with the sky above the sky and the heaven and earth isolated. The working surface, which could only accommodate more than 1,000 people, was expanded to accommodate more than 6,000 people and can be operated simultaneously; divided into five construction sections up and down, and organized fifteen small battles before and after. From May 20th to the end of June, the "arc" battle ended victoriously, and it took only forty days to complete the task that would normally take at least one year to complete.

In early July, the interior decoration project was basically completed, and the main contradiction of the construction shifted to the outdoors. In order to run ahead of time, projects such as building tap water, sewage, rainwater, gas, and heating pipelines, laying broadcasting, telecommunications, power, and lighting cables, building roads, and greening gardens must be constructed simultaneously and crosswise; a large number of machines and equipment withdrawn from the project and tens of thousands of cubic meters of slag need to be transported out, and tens of thousands of cubic meters of sand and gravel and nearly ten thousand plants of flowers and trees need to be transported in. As a result, more than a dozen cooperative units, tens of thousands of workers, and hundreds of vehicles, under the command of the Joint Command of the garden battle composed at that time, launched a battle of thousands of troops and horses on a limited working surface in the torrential rain that was not encountered in a century, and finally achieved a clean site, clear water and bright lights, and green trees, and the project was delivered for use on time and with quality.

Developing Communist Cooperation

In the construction process, the relevant departments of the Central Committee, many provinces and cities, and the relevant units across the country gave us great support by promoting a high degree of communist cooperation. Soviet construction experts in Beijing also gave us a lot of help in technology.

When the project began construction, it faced many difficulties. There was a shortage of construction technical forces, a large number of building materials and construction machinery and equipment needed to be quickly mobilized and entered the site, and thousands of types and hundreds of thousands of building components and equipment needed to be processed and manufactured as soon as possible. The great significance of building the Great Hall of the People encouraged the people of the whole country, and support hands extended from all directions. They said: "For the construction of the capital, there are people if you want people, and there are things if you want things." The relevant departments of the Central Committee gave a lot of help under the overall arrangement of the State Planning Commission. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the First Ministry of Machine Building vigorously organized the production of steel and the supply of machinery and equipment, the Ministry of Forestry Industry transferred a large number of high-quality wood, the Ministry of Railways allocated special trains to transport equipment, and the Ministry of Construction Engineering transferred construction forces from construction enterprises across the country to support. Eighteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions successively sent more than 7,000 outstanding technical workers and technicians, and officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, cadres of state organs, students, and citizens all rushed to participate in voluntary labor. They showed a high degree of enthusiasm in the construction and created many moving deeds. The workers of more than 200 factories in 23 provinces and cities enthusiastically rushed to manufacture a large number of building components and equipment for the Great Hall of the People. Some set up factories specifically for it, some repeatedly trial-produced new products, and some even changed their original production plans to strive to complete the processing and ordering tasks of the Great Hall of the People ahead of schedule. When Angang workers were manufacturing steel for the Great Hall of the People project, they were particularly careful to ensure product quality and only left the factory after repeated tests. After the Shanghai Lighting Factory made the red five-star lamp with a diameter of more than four meters in the Great Auditorium for ten thousand people, the worker comrades protected it with twenty-six cotton quilts and escorted it to Beijing. There are countless such exciting examples.

Adhering to Putting Politics in Command

The reason why we were able to build the Great Hall of the People in more than ten months is first of all due to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Municipal Party Committee, due to the correct implementation of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of all parties, and timely handling a series of complex problems in the construction process. Secondly, it is due to the guidance and help of the relevant departments of the Central Committee, and the enthusiastic support and cooperation of many provinces and cities across the country and the relevant units in the city, which timely and fully guaranteed the supply of manpower and materials. Third, it is because we have always adhered to the policy of putting politics in command and conducting mass movements on a large scale, and through a series of mass movements, greatly improved the political awareness and organizational level of the masses, and greatly improved the technical level, business ability and organizational management level of the workers.

In the construction process, the Party committee has always implemented the guiding ideology of despising difficulties strategically and attaching importance to difficulties tactically, timely analyzed favorable conditions, sufficiently estimated various objective possibilities for completing tasks, liberated the minds of the vast majority of workers, boosted their morale, dared to undertake this arduous task, and dared to formulate advanced plans; the Party committee also fully anticipated the various difficulties that may be encountered in the work, put the difficulties in front of the masses, so that the vast majority of workers tried every means to overcome the difficulties, and put the advanced plan on a solid and reliable basis. The Party committee also paid timely attention to correcting the right-leaning conservative thinking and fear of difficulties generated by some comrades when encountering difficulties and setbacks, and paid attention to constantly overcoming the arrogance, complacency, and blind optimism generated by some comrades due to winning victories.

Concentrating Forces to Fight Annihilation Battles

In terms of construction deployment, the Party committee resolutely implemented the principle of "overall planning, comprehensive arrangement, concentrating superior forces, focusing on key points, and fighting annihilation battles." Under the overall arrangement of the entire project, small battles were organized according to different construction stages. Since the small battles have a short time, clear goals, specific tasks, and loud slogans, it is convenient to mobilize the masses, convenient to organize management, convenient to achieve vivid and specific leadership, and convenient for functional departments to carry out work around this center, thus forming a situation where one horse takes the lead and ten thousand horses gallop. In the entire construction process, we organized more than 150 large and small battles, accumulating small victories into great victories, focusing on one batch and then doing another batch, one battle after another, one victory after another, and finally won the great victory of fully building the Great Hall of the People.

In terms of organizational management, first of all, we insisted on implementing a centralized leadership, unified command, hierarchical responsibility, and responsibility system for each area. This can enable the leadership to have an overall view and grasp the key, and also enable the branches and even the worker teams to carry out work independently. Every time the worker team completes a task, it conducts a "four-determination to the group" work according to the overall plan requirements, so that the four indicators of quality, efficiency, construction period, and material consumption are mastered by the worker masses. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, with the construction unit as the main body, a joint command was formed. Through the compilation of a comprehensive construction plan, design, materials, supply, transportation, equipment installation, roads, water supply and drainage, gas, heating, broadcasting, greening and other units were organized to fight jointly, in order to implement multi-trade three-dimensional intersection and parallel flow operation, make full use of time and space, and greatly accelerate the construction progress. In the entire construction process, the Party committee tightly grasped the overall planning, rational arrangement, and established the idea of a chess game, and correctly handled the cooperative relationship between the top and bottom, between the cooperative units, and between the professional trades.

In terms of leadership methods, we have always implemented the method of combining breaking through one point and guiding the overall situation with the masses, and combined the vigorous mass movement with scientific and meticulous management work, putting the management work on a broad mass foundation, and conversely, strengthening the management work promoted the upsurge of the mass movement.

The completion of the Great Hall of the People is a victory for the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, a victory for the Great Leap Forward, a victory for putting politics in command and conducting mass movements on a large scale, and a victory for communist cooperation. Now, we must guard against arrogance and impetuosity, under the radiant illumination of the General Line, boost greater revolutionary enthusiasm, and advance bravely with the people of the whole country to strive for new and greater victories!

    人民大会堂建设的胜利
    北京市第一建筑工程公司副经理　刘志贤
    我们公司全体职工在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在全国人民大力支援下，以冲天的革命干劲，多快好省地建成了人民大会堂。
    人民大会堂南北长三百三十六米，中央最高部位达四十六米，面积为十七万一千八百平方米，超过故宫全部有效建筑面积的总和。整个建筑物由能容纳万人的大礼堂、五千个席位的宴会厅和人大常委办公楼三个主要部分组成。大会堂内部装设着各种现代化的设备。有随时可以调节室内温度和湿度的冷风和热风；有高压蒸汽和煤气，有能同时翻译十二种语言的译意风，有扩音、广播、电讯、电视和拍摄影片的机电设备等。建筑物的结构很复杂。有二米见方、高四十五米、承重三千多吨的钢筋混凝土大柱子；有高九米、长三十四米的钢筋混凝土大梁；有跨度六十多米的钢屋架；有重达一百四十一吨的大钢梁；有钢梁悬臂延伸达十六米的大挑台。这个工程的工程量也是很大的：土方四十三万多立方米，钢筋混凝土十二万七千多立方米，照明电线和电缆六百七十多公里，动力电线和电缆四十五公里……。
    这样规模宏大、技术复杂的工程，从去年9月中旬才开始草拟设计方案，10月28日开工，到今年8月底仅十个多月时间就全部建成了。经人民大会堂工程验收委员会验收证明，质量是优良的。
    大搞群众运动
    这项工程是在边设计、边准备、边施工的情况下进行的。为了密切配合施工，一百五十余位设计人员驻在现场，深入群众，进行设计工作。工人同志们不管是自己熟悉或不熟悉的工作，只要工程需要，就服从分配，刻苦地钻研和学习，创造性地解决了许多复杂的技术问题，克服了技术工人严重不足的困难。他们在工作中不讲报酬，争先恐后地担当着最艰巨的任务。哪里是主导工序和关键部位，哪里出现了薄弱环节，他们就主动地互相支援。广大职工的这种共产主义劳动态度，是胜利完成这项工程的最基本的保证之一。
    为了争取时间，我们拿到第一张图纸的第二天，就立即开工。机械、人力同时上阵，工人、干部全体动手，数千名来工地参加义务劳动的人们，都卷入了挖土方的大战中。当挖到五米深的时候，碰到了辽金时代的古河道。于是工人同志们就夜以继日地和又黑又臭的淤泥展开了搏斗，一个月就挖出了三十五万立方米的土方，打上了混凝土基础，赢得了第一个战役的胜利。
    3月下旬，大礼堂内展开了吊装钢屋架的战斗。把六十多米长、七米高、每榀五十余吨重的十二榀钢屋架，吊到四十多米的高空就位，遇到一次又一次的困难。从富拉尔基、包头、太原、酒泉等地调来了大批有经验的吊装工人、技术人员，他们和北京的吊装工人并肩作战。经过多次研究，采用了两台人字扒杆，从钢梁两端抬吊的办法。钢屋架才吊离地面不久，由于跨度太大，刚度不够，产生了水平弯曲现象，两次试吊都没有成功。综合进度计划所控制的工期大大拖后了，人们的心情沉重而焦急，这是一个决定性的关头。在党委领导下，“三结合”的会议又开起来了，领导干部、工人、技术人员和设计人员反复研究，最后决定采用钢支架加固的办法。设计和加工部门接到制做钢支架的通知，就连夜设计，连夜加工，两天两夜安装完毕，第三次试吊成功了。又一次胜利地战胜了困难。
    钢屋架和两层挑台的钢梁吊装完毕后，已到5月，离竣工日期只有三个多月了，大部分工程已进入装修阶段。但是，大礼堂内部，两层挑台要打混凝土，顶上要钉大小三层骨架，骨架上要钉“水天一色”的天花板；全部地面工程从回填砂石、砌地陇墙到铺地板，都没有开始；大量的吊顶、抹灰工程，油漆、灯具、桌椅、冷热风、译意风、电视、摄影灯光、扩音系统等设备安装工程，上上下下几十项工作都急待进行。能否在短短三个月的时间内全部彻底完成这些工作，成为当时重中之重、急中之急的关键部位了。
    工地党委分析了当时的形势，召开了群众大会，依靠群众集体智慧来解决这样一个问题：怎样在圆弧形的大礼堂内充分利用时间和空间，使天上、地下、四周，错综复杂的工序能够同时进行立体交叉、平行流水作业？
    架子工们在党委启发下，和技术人员一起发挥了高度的智慧，计算了顶棚上满天星斗般的灯孔位置，巧妙地通过灯圈，从钢梁上插下一根根不落地的杉槁，随即从上顺杆而下，悬立在离地面三十多米的高空，绑扎横的“顺水”杉槁。工人们在这样惊险而又紧张的劳动中展开了面对面的竞赛。结果，整个顶棚和两层挑台下面，都搭上了悬空脚手架，把整个大礼堂变成了天上有天，天地隔绝的八层操作台。原来只能容纳一千余人的工作面扩大到能容纳六千多人，并能同时操作；上下分成五个施工段，前后组织了十五次小战役。从5月20日起至6月底，“圆弧”大战胜利结束，只用了四十天的时间完成了按照常规起码需要一年才能完成的任务。
    7月上旬，室内装修工程基本完成，施工的主要矛盾转到室外。为了跑在时间前面，修建自来水、污水、雨水、煤气、热力等管线，敷设广播、电讯、动力和照明电缆，修筑道路和绿化庭园等工程必须同时交叉施工；从工程上撤下来的大批的机具设备和几万立方米的渣土需要运出去，几万立方米的砂石和近万株的花草树木需要运进来。于是十几个协作单位、万余工人、数百辆汽车，在当时组成的庭园大战联合指挥部的指挥下，在有限的工作面上冒着百年不遇的滂沱大雨，展开了千军万马的战斗，最后做到了地净场光，水通灯亮，绿树成荫，工程如期如质地交付使用。
  开展共产主义协作
    在建设过程中，中央各有关部门，许多省、市和全国各有关单位发扬了高度的共产主义协作精神，给了我们极大的支援。在京的苏联建筑专家在技术上也给了我们许多帮助。
    当工程开始建设的时候，就面临着许多困难。施工技术力量不足、大批的建筑材料和施工机具需要迅速调集入场，上千种、几十万件建筑配件和设备需要尽快地加工制作等。建设人民大会堂的伟大意义鼓舞着全国人民，四面八方伸出了支援的手。他们说：“为了首都建设，要人有人，要东西有东西。”中央各有关部在国家计划委员会的统筹安排下给了很多帮助。冶金工业部、第一机械工业部大力组织了钢材生产和机械设备的供应，森林工业部调来了大批的上等木材，铁道部拨出专车运送器材，建筑工程部从全国建筑企业里抽调了建筑力量来支援。十八个省、市、自治区先后派来了七千多名优秀的技术工人和技术人员，中国人民解放军官兵、国家机关干部、学生和市民，也都纷纷赶来参加义务劳动。他们在施工中表现了高度的积极性，创造了许多动人的事迹。二十三个省、市的二百多个工厂的职工，极其热情地为人民大会堂赶制大批的建筑配件和设备。有的专为它设立工厂，有的一次又一次地试制新产品，有的甚至不惜改变原来的生产部署，力争提前完成人民大会堂的加工订货任务。鞍钢工人在为人民大会堂工程制造钢材时，特别小心在意，保证产品质量，经过多次化验后才出厂。上海灯具厂做好万人大礼堂内的直径四米多的红五星灯后，工人同志为了保护它，用二十六条棉被包起来护送来京。这种激动人心的事例实在数不胜数。
    坚持政治挂帅
    我们所以能够在十个多月内建成人民大会堂，首先是由于党中央和市委的正确领导，由于正确贯彻了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，充分调动了各方面的积极性，及时处理了建设过程中一系列的复杂问题。其次，是由于中央各有关部门的指导、帮助，全国许多省、市和全市各有关单位的热情支援配合，及时而充分地保证了人力、物力的供应。第三，是由于我们始终坚持执行了政治挂帅、大搞群众运动的方针，通过一系列的群众运动，大大地提高了群众的政治觉悟和组织程度，大大地提高了职工的技术水平、业务能力和组织管理水平。
    在施工过程中，党委始终贯彻了战略上藐视困难，战术上重视困难的指导思想，及时分析有利条件，足够地估计了完成任务的各种客观可能性，使广大职工思想解放，斗志昂扬，敢于担当这一艰巨任务，敢于制定先进计划；党委还充分预见到工作中可能遇到的各种困难，把困难摆在群众面前，使广大职工千方百计地去克服困难，把先进的计划放在切实可靠的基础上。党委还及时注意纠正某些同志在遇到困难和挫折时产生的右倾保守思想和畏难情绪，注意不断地克服某些同志由于获得胜利而产生的骄傲自满和盲目乐观情绪。
  集中兵力打歼灭战
    在施工部署上，党委坚决贯彻了“统筹全局，全面安排，集中优势兵力，突击重点，打歼灭战”的方针。在整个工程的全面安排下，按不同施工阶段组织小战役。由于小战役的时间较短，目标明确，任务具体，口号响亮，便于发动群众，便于组织管理，便于实现生动具体的领导，也便于职能部门围绕这个中心进行工作，从而形成了一个一马当先、万马奔腾的局面。在整个施工过程中，我们一共组织了一百五十余次大小战役，积小胜为大胜，突击一批，再搞一批，一个战役接着一个战役，一个胜利接着一个胜利，最后赢得了全部建成人民大会堂的伟大胜利。
    在组织管理上，首先坚持实行了集中领导，统一指挥，分层负责、分片包干的责任制度。这样既可以使领导上统筹全局，抓住关键，又可以使各分支单位，以至工人队组独立自主地进行工作。工人队组每完成一项任务，都根据总的计划要求，进行一次“四定到组”的工作，使质量、效率、工期和材料用量四项指标为工人群众所掌握。在党委的统一领导下，以建筑施工单位为主，组成联合指挥部，通过编制综合施工计划，把设计、物资、供应、运输、设备安装、道路、上下水道、煤气、热力、广播、绿化等单位组织起来，联合作战，以便实行多工种的立体交叉，平行流水作业，充分利用时间和空间，大大加快施工进度。在整个施工过程中，党委紧紧掌握着统筹全局，合理安排，树立一盘棋的思想，正确处理上下之间、各协作单位之间、各专业工种之间的协作关系。
    在领导方法上，始终贯彻着突破一点、指导全面的领导与群众相结合的方法，把轰轰烈烈的群众运动同科学细致的管理工作结合起来，管理工作置于广泛的群众基础之上，反过来，管理工作加强了，又促进了群众运动的高涨。
    人民大会堂的建成是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是大跃进的胜利，是政治挂帅、大搞群众运动的胜利，是共产主义大协作的胜利。现在，我们一定要戒骄戒躁，在总路线的光辉照耀下，鼓起更大的革命干劲，和全国人民一道奋勇前进，争取新的更大的胜利！
