According to the Hebei Daily, the people's communes in Baodi County have fully utilized natural conditions, concentrated manpower, materials, and funds, and developed a diversified economy at high speed. Since the beginning of this year, the total value of diversified economic activities in the county has reached more than 53 million yuan, with a net income of 23.5 million yuan, averaging 213 yuan per household, an increase of 48.7% over last year.

With the rapid development of a diversified economy, the economic landscape of the county has undergone significant changes. Out of 870 poor teams, 520 have caught up with the living standards of rich teams. Last year, more than 80% of production teams suffered from floods, but through the development of diversified operations, these production teams successfully overcame the disaster. Industrial and agricultural production has also been strongly supported. Since the beginning of this year, the county has used more than 8.5 million yuan of diversified economic income to support industrial and agricultural production. This year, the county's grain output is expected to reach more than 400 million jin, with an average yield of 380 jin per mu, an increase of more than 50% over last year. It has also provided a large number of non-staple foods and daily necessities to cities, further strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. This year, the county supplied more than 30 kinds of commodities to cities, with a total value of more than 38 million yuan, an increase of more than two times over last year.

Fully Utilize Natural Resources

Baodi County has many rivers and ponds, vast grasslands, countless beaches, and a large amount of reed fields and cattails. These rich resources were not fully and rationally utilized before communization. After communization, the power of the people's communes was brought into play. First, in accordance with the spirit of "adapting to local conditions and using local materials," a plan for developing a diversified economy was formulated, so that resources that had not been utilized for many years were fully utilized, resources that had been used irrationally in the past were rationally utilized, and handicraft and sideline production, which had developed very slowly in the past, achieved a leap forward. In agricultural cooperatives, there were more than 1,500 pits and ponds in the county that could be used to grow lotus roots and raise fish, but they had never been utilized. Now they have all become fish ponds. More than 200,000 mu of sandy wasteland has been planted with 217,000 fruit trees and more than 12 million trees under the unified planning of the commune, giving the sandy wasteland a green appearance. In areas with higher terrain, weaving, agricultural product processing, workshops, making shoe soles, making straw bags, boiling saltpeter, transportation, and raising poultry and livestock have also been widely carried out.

Reasonable Arrangement of Labor

In agricultural cooperatives, due to the small scale and limited labor force, it was often impossible to take care of both agricultural production and sideline production. Even if some sideline production was started, it had to be stopped during the busy farming season. After communization, the county party committee, based on the characteristics of the large organizational scale and wide range of activities of the commune, made overall arrangements and rational use of labor to ensure a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural and sideline production. In accordance with the spirit of "small-scale work during busy farming seasons and large-scale work during slack farming seasons," the people's communes generally have about 30% of their labor force engaged in sideline occupations. In order to further improve labor efficiency, the methods of industrialization were implemented for textile, weaving, saltpeter boiling and other handicraft production. A total of 880 handicraft factories were established in the county, with more than 26,000 skilled female laborers and a small number of male laborers assigned to fixed production. For fish farming, transportation, fruit tree cultivation, etc., more than 1,800 specialized teams were organized to be responsible for management. For small-scale sideline production suitable for decentralized operation, members were allowed to operate, and the commune teams strengthened leadership. This ensured the simultaneous development of collectively operated sideline occupations and members' household sideline occupations.

Technological Innovation to Improve Efficiency

After communization, the wisdom of the broad masses of commune members was fully utilized, and a technological innovation movement of "everyone creating and everyone inventing" was launched. In the past year, more than 20 kinds and 856 pieces of production tools for fish farming, crab farming, processing and other handicraft sideline production have been created and modified, greatly improving production efficiency. Zhangtouwo Production Team of Lintingkou Commune created the "pulley-type combined dragnet device," which saved manpower by half and increased fish output by more than 20%. Members of Heilang Commune modified the "rope-traction net" based on the principle of rope-traction plow, breaking the superstition that local areas could not cast nets in deep water to farm fish. Each commune has established breeding stations and stud farms as places to study and promote breeding technology. In order to universally promote advanced experience, each commune adopted the methods of "special personnel teaching, apprentice-style learning, organizing visits, and on-site demonstrations." The communes in the county trained more than 3,000 technicians in various industries as teachers, and organized 68 on-site technical exchange meetings on fish farming, saltpeter boiling, textile, and livestock breeding. In the past, no bees were raised here at all, but this year 70 boxes of bees were raised.

Further Strengthen Leadership

In agricultural cooperatives, due to weak leadership, the leadership of diversified economic activities was often relaxed. The cadre force of the commune is much stronger than that of the agricultural cooperative, so that someone is responsible for all tasks, achieving a comprehensive leap forward without losing a single item. All communes in the county have strengthened the front line of diversified economic activities. Communes in water areas have also established fisheries production command headquarters, headed by a secretary or director; production teams are also managed by the secretary or captain who specializes in diversified operations, forming a strong line from top to bottom. Leaders at all levels have grasped the mass movement, planting red flags, setting up pacesetters, and conducting inspections and comparisons in a timely manner. Lintingkou Commune promoted the experience of Zhangtouwo Production Team, which produced more than 40,000 jin of fish per day, and immediately launched a competition upsurge of "learning from, catching up with, and surpassing" throughout the commune, and fish production continued to rise.

Encouraged by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the communes put forward the requirement of "working hard for the three months of winter, increasing income by 40 yuan per person," revised the targets, transferred troops and generals, and entered a new battle. Now, more than 65,000 people in the county have started 108 kinds of production. The income of diversified operations in the county has increased from an average of 70,000 yuan per day in October to more than 100,000 yuan.

    集体经营为主公私同时并举　充分利用资源发展多种经济
    宝坻县60％穷队赶上富队
    据河北日报消息　宝坻县各人民公社充分利用自然条件，集中人力、物力、资金，高速度地发展了多种经济生产。今年以来，全县多种经济总值达到五千三百多万元，纯收入达二千三百五十万元，平均每户二百一十三元，比去年增加48.7％。
    随着多种经济的迅速发展，全县经济面貌发生了显著变化。八百七十个穷队，已有五百二十个赶上了富队的生活水平。去年由于沥涝成灾，有80％以上的生产队缺粮，经过开展多种经营，这些生产队顺利地渡过了灾荒。工农业生产更得到有力的支持，今年以来全县用多种经济收入支持工农业生产的资金达八百五十多万元。今年全县的粮食产量可达四亿多斤，平均亩产量三百八十斤，比去年提高50％以上。还给城市提供了大批副食品和日用品，进一步加强了工农联盟。今年，全县供给城市的商品有三十多种，总值达三千八百多万元，比去年增加两倍多。
    充分地利用自然资源
    宝坻县有许多河流坑塘，有宽阔的草原，有无数的沙滩，有大量的苇田、蒲草等。这些丰富的资源，在公社化前一直没有得到充分合理的利用。公社化以后，发挥了人民公社的力量，首先根据“因地制宜，就地取材”的精神，制定了发展多种经营的规划，从而使多年来没有利用的资源得到了充分利用，使过去利用不合理的资源得到合理利用，使过去发展很慢的手工业和副业生产得到了飞跃发展。在农业社时，全县有一千五百多个坑塘可以栽藕和养鱼，但一直没有利用，现在都变成了鱼塘。二十多万亩沙荒废地，在公社的统一规划下，栽培了果树二十一万七千株，植树一千二百多万棵，使沙荒披上了绿装。在地势比较高的地区也普遍搞起了编织、农产品加工、作坊、纳鞋底、打草袋、熬硝、运输、饲养家禽家畜等多种生产。
    合理安排劳力
    在农业社时，由于规模小，劳力少，往往顾了搞农业生产顾不了发展副业生产，即便搞起一些副业，到农忙时也不得不停止生产。公社化后，县委根据公社组织规模大、活动范围广的特点，统筹安排和合理使用劳动力，保证农、副业生产全面跃进。各人民公社根据“农忙小搞，农闲大搞”的精神，一般有30％左右的劳力搞副业。为了进一步提高劳动效率，对于纺织、编织、熬硝等手工业生产，实行了工厂化的办法，全县共建立起八百八十个手工业厂，确定二万六千多名有技术的妇女劳力和一小部分男劳动力，固定生产；对于治鱼、运输、栽培果树等，组织了一千八百多个专业队负责管理；对于适合分散经营的小型副业生产，让社员经营，社队加强领导。这样，就保证了集体经营的副业和社员家庭副业同时发展。
    革新技术提高效率
    公社化以后，充分发挥了广大社员的智慧，开展了“人人创造、个个发明”的技术革新运动。一年来，创造和改制治鱼、治蟹、加工等手工业副业生产工具达二十多种，八百五十六件，生产效率大大提高。林亭口公社张头窝生产队，创造了“滑车合龙出网器”，人力节省一倍，出鱼量提高20％以上，黑狼公社的社员们根据绳索牵引犁的原理，改制了“绳索牵引网”，打破了当地不能在深水撒网治鱼的迷信。各公社都建立配种站和种猪场，作为研究推广配种技术的场所。为了普遍推广先进经验，各社都采取了“专人传授，以师代徒，组织参观，当场演习”的办法。全县各公社共训练了三千多名各行业的技术员当教师，组织了六十八次治鱼、养鱼、熬硝、纺织、牲畜配种等技术交流现场会。过去这里根本没有养过蜂，今年也养了七十箱蜂。
    进一步加强领导
    农业社时，由于领导力量薄弱，往往放松多种经济的领导。公社的干部力量比农业社强得多，使各项工作都有人负责，做到全面跃进，一项不丢。全县各个公社都加强了多种经济战线，水区的公社还建立了渔业生产指挥部，由一名书记或主任负责掌握；生产队也都由书记或队长专管多种经营，从上到下建成了一条坚强的战线。各级领导都抓住了大搞群众运动，插红旗、树标兵，及时进行检查评比。林亭口公社推广了张头窝生产队日产鱼四万多斤的经验，立即在全社范围内掀起“学、赶、超”的竞赛高潮，鱼产量不断上升。
    在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，各社提出了“大干冬三月，每人增收四十元”的要求，重新修订了指标，调兵遣将，投入了新的战斗。现在，全县已有六万五千多人搞起一百零八种生产。全县多种经营的收入由10月份平均每天七万元增加到十万多元。
