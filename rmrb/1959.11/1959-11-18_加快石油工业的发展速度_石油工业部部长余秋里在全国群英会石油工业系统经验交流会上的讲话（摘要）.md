Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the face of China's petroleum industry has undergone preliminary changes. After large-scale petroleum geological exploration, China now has thirty-two oil fields and eighteen gas fields available for industrial exploitation, more than eight times the four oil fields and two gas fields before liberation. After liberation, we discovered forty-four oil and gas fields, of which thirty-two, or 72%, were newly discovered during the Great Leap Forward last year and the continued leap forward this year. There is still more than a month left this year, and we may discover oil fields in new exploration areas. At the same time, the area of oil fields and recoverable reserves have also greatly increased since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. All this shows that the important material basis for the development of the petroleum industry, namely natural petroleum resources, has a reliable basis. There has also been great development in synthetic petroleum. The construction speed of several large-scale synthetic oil plants is very fast, and more importantly, more than 1,000 small and medium-sized synthetic oil plants have been built in various provinces and cities across the country, and the processed products have also met general requirements. This proves that the "walking on two legs" policy put forward by the Party is completely correct. The completion of these small and medium-sized plants has not only increased crude oil production, but also opened up a broad road for the development of the petroleum industry. After further improvement, these small and medium-sized plants will play a significant role in the Great Leap Forward of industry and agriculture, especially in supporting agriculture. There has also been great development in refining, machinery repair, manufacturing, and transportation, and many outstanding achievements have been made. In terms of petroleum products, through technological innovation and technological revolution, we have successfully trial-produced many new varieties, the output of various products has greatly increased, the quality has also been greatly improved, and we can also produce many high-end products. In short, it can now be said that China's petroleum industry has initially formed a relatively complete system. This year, China's crude oil production will be 29 times that of 1949. In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, the annual output increased by 55% compared with 1957, and this year it will increase by more than 55% compared with last year. It can be predicted that China's petroleum industry will advance with greater strides in the future, following the Party's general line and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies.

Our achievements are great, but the distance from the goals we want to achieve is still very far. The lofty goal of the Chinese people is to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science in a not-too-long period of time. In order to achieve this goal, our petroleum industry is required to support the growing needs of agriculture, industry, transportation, and national defense construction with more products. This requires all departments of our petroleum industry to coordinate and undertake this glorious and arduous task. Comrades on the petroleum industry front will certainly be able to fulfill the expectations of the people of the whole country and will certainly be able to realize this glorious task.

In order to achieve this task, we must first do a good job in the work of the next month or so, ensure the early and over-fulfillment of this year's production tasks, and make full preparations for the continued leap forward in the first quarter of next year, so that the upsurge of the leap forward will continue and last. To this end, we must continue to strengthen oil well management and well repair work; vigorously grasp exploration; vigorously strengthen transportation work; and make preparations for the equipment maintenance of synthetic oil plants and refineries as soon as possible. As for the small and medium-sized synthetic petroleum plants in various places, they should also continue to be consolidated and improved, and further developed in places where resources are suitable.

In order to ensure the continued leap forward of the petroleum industry, we must also pay attention to the following issues:

One, we must continue to adhere to putting politics in command and further give play to the consciousness, creativity, and initiative of the broad masses of workers and staff. Petroleum production is nothing more than the interaction of people, machines (equipment), and stones (minerals). Machines and stones are dead. It is up to people to subdue them so that they can play a role. Therefore, the most active and decisive factor in production is people. For example, the high-yield oil fields in Baijantan, Xinjiang, and Lenghu, Qinghai, have always existed, so why were they only discovered last year? This is because, under the guidance of the Party's general line, the creativity and initiative of people have been fully utilized.

Two, we must guide the vigorous mass movement to the center of technological innovation and technological revolution, and combine hard work with smart work. Of course, only through hard work can we have smart work, and the soul of hard work is political consciousness. But if we only work hard and do not add smart work, it will be difficult to develop production at high speed. We must emancipate our minds, break superstitions, carry forward the communist style of daring to think and daring to do, and vigorously engage in technological innovation and technological revolution around the current central work and production key.

Three, continue to carry out the labor competition of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping each other. The various competition forms currently being carried out by various units, such as opponent competitions, one-dragon competitions, pacesetter competitions, collaboration competitions, and technical performance competitions, should be maintained and promoted.

Four, we must combine carrying out mass movements with improving enterprise management. Cadres participating in labor, workers participating in management, continuous reform of unreasonable rules and regulations and technical standards, the establishment of new and reasonable rules and regulations and technical standards, and the three-in-one system and working methods of cadres, workers, and technical personnel should all be continued. The supply of materials and equipment, the manufacture of spare parts, the maintenance of machinery, safety work, and the combination of work and rest must all be paid great attention to and strengthened and improved.

Five, we must study hard. All advanced producers, workers, and cadres should study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works hard, continuously improve their communist consciousness; diligently study new production experiences, conscientiously learn advanced technologies, better familiarize themselves with their business, and train themselves into both red and expert workers and cadres.

Now our great motherland is showing a prosperous scene everywhere; the future of the petroleum industry is also full of unlimited light. As long as we continue to hold high the red flag of the general line and advance under the leadership of the Party, we will be able to achieve greater and more brilliant achievements.

    加快石油工业的发展速度
    ——石油工业部部长余秋里在全国群英会石油工业系统经验交流会上的讲话（摘要）
    从1958年大跃进以来，我国石油工业的面貌已初步改变了。经过大规模的石油地质勘探，目前我国已拥有可供工业开采的油田三十二处，气田十八处，为解放前原有油田四处、气田二处的八倍多。解放后我们发现了四十四处油气田，其中有三十二处，即72％是在去年大跃进和今年的继续跃进中新发现的。今年还有一个多月，我们还可能在新的勘探地区发现油田。同时油田面积和可采储量，从1958年大跃进以来，也比过去大大的增加了。这些都说明，石油工业发展的重要物质基础即天然石油资源有了可靠的着落。在人造石油方面也有很大发展。几个大型人造油厂的建设速度很快，更重要的是全国各省市已建成了中小型人造油厂一千多个，加工的产品，也达到了一般要求。这证明党所提出的“两条腿走路”的方针是完全正确的。这些中小型厂的建成，不仅在原油产量上增加了，而且为发展石油工业开辟了一条广阔的道路。这些中小型厂经过进一步提高以后，将在工农业大跃进中发挥重大的作用，特别是对支援农业有更大的作用。在炼油、机械修理、制造、运输等方面也都有了很大的发展，也都取得了很多突出的成就。在石油产品方面，经过技术革新和技术革命，我们试制成功了许多新品种，各种产品的产量大大增加，质量也大有改进，还能生产不少高级产品。总之，现在可以说，我国的石油工业已初步形成了一个比较完整的体系。今年我国原油产量将为1949年的二十九倍，大跃进的1958年，年产量比1957年增长了55％，而今年又将比去年增长55％以上。可以预料，我国石油工业遵照党的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，今后将以更大的步伐向前迈进。
    我们的成就是伟大的，但离我们所要达到的目标距离还很远。我国人民的远大目标是在一个不太长的时间内，把我国建设成为一个拥有现代工业，现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。为了达到这个目标，要求我们石油工业以更多的产品来支援农业、工业、交通运输业和国防建设日益增长的需要。这就要求我们石油工业各个部门，大家协调一致担负起这个光荣而艰巨的任务。石油工业战线上的同志们，一定能够圆满回答全国人民的期望，一定能够实现这个光荣的任务。
    为了实现这个任务，首先要做好今后一个多月的工作，保证提前超额完成今年的生产任务，并为明年第一季度的继续跃进做好充分的准备工作，使跃进高潮连续持久下去。为此，我们必须继续加强油井管理和修井工作；大抓勘探；大力加强运输工作；及早做好人造油厂和炼油厂的设备维修工作。至于各地的人造石油中、小厂，也要继续巩固和提高，并在资源适合的地方，进一步发展。
    为了保证石油工业继续跃进，我们还必须注意以下几个问题：
    一、必须继续坚持政治挂帅，进一步发挥广大职工群众的自觉性、创造性和积极性。石油生产，无非是人、机器（设备）和石头（矿物）互相作用。机器和石头是死的，要人去制服它，才能使它发挥作用，因此，在生产中最活跃最起决定作用的因素是人。如新疆白碱滩和青海冷湖高产油田是原来就存在的，为什么去年才发现？就是因为在党的总路线的指引下，充分发挥了人的创造性、积极性的结果。
    二、必须把轰轰烈烈的群众运动引导到技术革新、技术革命的中心上去，把苦干与巧干结合起来。当然，通过苦干才能有巧干，苦干的灵魂是政治觉悟。但如果只苦干，不加上巧干，就很难使生产高速度地发展。我们必须解放思想，破除迷信，发扬敢想敢做的共产主义风格，围绕当前中心工作和生产关键，大搞技术革新和技术革命。
    三、继续开展学先进、比先进、赶先进、互相帮助的劳动竞赛。现在各单位进行的各种对手赛、一条龙赛、标兵赛、协作赛、技术表演赛等竞赛形式要继续保持，并加以推广。
    四、必须把开展群众运动与改进企业管理工作结合起来。干部参加劳动，工人参加管理，不断改革不合理的规章制度和技术标准，建立新的合理的规章制度和技术标准，干部、工人、技术人员三结合的制度和工作方法，都应该继续坚持。器材设备的供应，配件的制造，机械的维修，安全工作，劳逸结合等各方面，都必须十分注意加强和改进。
    五、必须努力学习。所有的先进生产者、工人和干部，都应该努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席的著作，不断提高自己的共产主义觉悟；要刻苦地钻研新的生产经验，认真地学习先进技术，更好地熟悉业务，把自己锻炼成红透专深的工人和干部。
    现在我们伟大的祖国到处呈现一片欣欣向荣的景象；石油工业的前途，也是充满无限光明。只要我们在党的领导下，继续高举总路线的红旗前进，我们就能够取得更伟大、更辉煌的成就。
