Ode to "Strive for the Top"
　　Guan Feng
　　The Great Leap Forward of 1958 and this year's continued leap forward have fully demonstrated that the Party's General Line of "Going All Out, Aiming High, and Achieving Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results in Building Socialism" is entirely correct. The basic points of this General Line fully and correctly reflect the objective laws of socialist economic, political, and cultural development. Its "Going All Out, Aiming High" is to fully mobilize the creativity of the 600 million people, maintain a full spirit of continuous revolution, highly develop subjective initiative, fully utilize objective laws, and strive for the greatest possible victory in building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Therefore, the Party's General Line is a Marxist-Leninist line that cleverly combines the subjective and objective, subjective initiative and objective laws.
　　Right opportunist elements, reflecting the demands of the bourgeoisie, starting from their subjective idealist and empiricist worldviews, stubbornly denied facts, reversed black and white, and frantically opposed the Party's General Line for socialist construction. On the one hand, they opposed the basic points of the General Line, and on the other hand, they opposed "Going All Out, Aiming High." They said that advocating "Striving for the Top" violates objective laws and violates "seeking truth from facts." Some even arrogantly demanded that the "Strive for the Top" in the General Line be changed to "Seeking Truth from Facts." This is complete nonsense. They separate "Striving for the Top" from respecting objective laws and "Seeking Truth from Facts," placing them in absolute opposition and in a mutually exclusive position. This shows that they violate the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism. Their opposition to "Striving for the Top" is opposition to the spirit of continuous revolution of the 600 million people, opposition to the 600 million people highly developing subjective initiative and fully utilizing objective laws to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, which is also opposition to the revolutionary nature of Marxism-Leninism. And what they call "Seeking Truth from Facts" is precisely "Being Opinionated" – this "Truth" is nothing but the bourgeoisie's desire to oppose socialism and restore capitalism.
　　What is "Seeking Truth from Facts"?
　　Comrade Mao Zedong said: "'Facts' are all things that exist objectively, 'Truth' is the internal connection of objective things, that is, the laws, and 'Seeking' is our research. We must proceed from the actual situation at home and abroad, inside and outside the province, inside and outside the county, and inside and outside the district, and deduce from them their inherent, not fabricated, laws, that is, find out the internal connections of surrounding events, as the guide for our actions."
　　Mao Zedong Thought, which serves as the ideological basis of the General Line, precisely proceeds from the actual situation at home and abroad and deduces from it the "inherent, not fabricated, laws," that is, the objective laws of socialist economic, political, and cultural development. The basic points stipulated by the Party's General Line are precisely to take the objective laws of China's socialist economic, political, and cultural development, as deduced by Comrade Mao Zedong, "as the guide for our actions," that is, to highly develop subjective initiative, fully utilize the objective laws of socialist economic, political, and cultural development, accelerate socialist construction, and strive for the highest possible speed and the greatest possible victory.
　　Who is the subject that fully utilizes the objective laws of socialist economic, political, and cultural development? What kind of mental attitude should this subject have in order to fully utilize the objective laws of socialist economic, political, and cultural development?
　　Marxism-Leninism believes that the people are the creators of history. Of course, the 600 million people of our country are also the creators of our socialist politics, economy, and culture. Under the leadership of the Party, the 600 million people of our country are the most important and greatest subjective force in our socialist revolution and socialist construction. This force is the subject that utilizes the laws of socialist economic, political, and cultural development to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The so-called utilization of objective laws means turning the practical conclusions drawn from objective laws into the actions of the broad masses, that is, the broad masses, under the guidance of correct policies, go all out and strive for the top to transform the objective world. Without this subjective initiative of the broad masses, there is no way to talk about fully utilizing objective laws.
　　In his famous "On Protracted War," Comrade Mao Zedong, after scientifically analyzing the laws of the War of Resistance Against Japan, on the one hand, emphasized the importance of correct plans, policies, strategies, and tactics that conform to objective reality. At the same time, he also repeatedly emphasized the importance of politically mobilizing the military and the people. He said: "This issue of politically mobilizing the military and the people is really too important. The reason why we repeatedly talk about this point is that there is no victory without this point. Without many other necessary things, there is certainly no victory, but this is the most basic condition for victory." He also said: "The deepest source of the great power of war lies in the masses."
　　Comrade Mao Zedong's above-mentioned arguments, like Lenin's words, are "a brilliant example of combining a very scientific and calm attitude to analyze the objective situation and the objective process of evolution with a very firm recognition of the significance of the revolutionary will, revolutionary creativity, and revolutionary initiative of the masses..." Its basic spirit is also completely applicable to socialist construction. We can say that "the deepest source of the great power" of socialist construction "lies in the masses," and the "Going All Out, Aiming High" of the 600 million people, this great revolutionary spiritual state, "is really too important," "there is no victory without this point. Without many other necessary things, there is certainly no victory, but this is the most basic condition for victory." Hasn't the vigorous mass revolutionary movement of the Great Leap Forward, which began in 1958, fully proven this point?
　　Right opportunist elements separate "Striving for the Top" from "Seeking Truth from Facts" and respecting objective laws, placing them in absolute opposition. This precisely shows that they use a subjective idealist worldview to oppose the Marxist dialectical materialism and historical materialism worldview.
　　Because they start from historical idealism, they will inevitably negate the great role of the subject that utilizes objective laws – the people – in creating history.
　　Since they deny the role of the subject of society – the people – they will inevitably distort the concept of social laws. Social laws are not alien forces added from outside society, but the laws of motion of society itself. Right opportunists deny the role of the subject of society – the people – so their concept of social laws becomes something fatalistic. In their view, social laws are alien forces that are unrelated to human actions and added from outside society. This alien force dictates how many tons of steel and how many catties of grain will be produced at a certain hour on a certain day in a certain year, neither one ton more nor one ton less, neither one catty more nor one catty less, it's the same whether you work or not. In their view, there is no question of striving for the top or not striving for the top, that is, it is fundamentally impossible and should not be "strived for." People can only listen to the arrangements of fate. Therefore, in their view, "Striving for the Top" is a violation of "objective laws" and a violation of "Seeking Truth from Facts."
　　In contrast to this view of "laws" of right opportunism, Marxism acknowledges objective laws that are independent of human will, but it does not mean denying or underestimating human subjective initiative. Instead, it organically combines them. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Marxist philosophy believes that the most important issue is not understanding the laws of the objective world, thus being able to explain the world, but using this understanding of objective laws to actively transform the world." The Party's General Line is precisely the most full expression of the Party's mobilization of the masses to actively transform the world after it has understood the objective laws of socialist construction.
　　Everyone knows that under the same conditions, the achievements people make can be different, even very different. Where does the reason lie? It lies in whether people's enthusiasm is full enough and whether their revolutionary spirit of striving for the top is strong enough. More than two thousand years ago, Guan Zhong said: "Do not do what cannot be done," but "do not fail to do what should be done." Within the scope permitted by objective conditions, great effort (that is, striving) will lead to great achievements (that is, the top), small effort will only lead to small achievements, and no effort will lead to no achievements. This is a common sense that has been proven thousands of times in daily life. Without "Going All Out, Aiming High," how can there be any full utilization of objective laws or "Seeking Truth from Facts"?
　　Separating "Striving for the Top" from respecting objective laws and "Seeking Truth from Facts," placing them in absolute opposition and in a mutually exclusive position – this is a presentation of right opportunism's idealism and fatalism. They neither "seek facts" (denying objective facts) nor "seek truth," but are purely opinionated. Their "truth" is a completely subjective and fabricated fatalism that violates objective laws, a weapon for undermining the revolutionary spiritual state of the people.
　　Unifying "Striving for the Top" with utilizing objective laws and "Seeking Truth from Facts" is the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint. The Party's General Line is precisely a line that appropriately unifies the two, fully embodying the combination of Marxism's scientific and revolutionary character.
　　So in essence, the question is not as raised by the right opportunists: is it "Striving for the Top" or "Seeking Truth from Facts"? The question is rather this: is it "Seeking Truth from Facts" and "Striving for the Top," or is it fatalism, thereby undermining the revolutionary spiritual state of the people?
　　"Going All Out, Aiming High, and Achieving Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results in Building Socialism" – truly, every word is worth a thousand pieces of gold. It has created a high-spirited and great revolutionary spiritual state among the people throughout the country, fully developed the subjective initiative to utilize objective laws to accelerate socialist construction, and created an unprecedented and vigorous Great Leap Forward. Right opportunists, under the banner of "Seeking Truth from Facts," oppose "Striving for the Top," which is standing on the bourgeois standpoint, opposing the revolutionary nature of Marxism (and of course, therefore, opposing its scientific nature), attempting to disintegrate the soaring enthusiasm of the 600 million people, attempting to destroy the great revolutionary spirit and great revolutionary spirit of the 600 million people in "Striving for the Top," and restoring the adverse current of capitalism. Therefore, we must thoroughly smash the platitudes of right opportunism. Enthusiasm must always be fully exerted, and the top must always be strived for.

    “力争上游”颂
    关锋
    1958年的大跃进和今年的继续跃进，充分证明了党的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，是完全正确的。这条总路线的基本点，充分地正确地反映了社会主义经济和政治、文化发展的客观规律性；其“鼓足干劲，力争上游”，则是把六亿人民的创造力充分地动员起来，以饱满的不断革命的精神状态，高度地发挥主观能动性，充分利用客观规律，争取可能争取到的最大胜利，多快好省地建设社会主义。所以，党的总路线是把主观和客观、主观能动性和客观规律性巧妙地结合起来的马克思列宁主义路线。
    反映资产阶级要求的右倾机会主义分子，从他们的主观唯心主义的经验论世界观出发，硬是否认事实、颠倒黑白，疯狂地反对党的社会主义建设总路线。他们一方面反对总路线的基本点，一方面反对“鼓足干劲，力争上游”。他们说：提“力争上游”就违背了客观规律，违背了“实事求是”。甚至有的狂妄地要求把总路线中的“力争上游”改为“实事求是”。这完全是一派胡说。他们把“力争上游”同尊重客观规律、“实事求是”分割开来，绝对对立起来，把它们列于互相排斥的地位，这就表明他们违背了马克思列宁主义的基本观点。他们反对“力争上游”，就是反对六亿人民的不断革命的精神状态，就是反对六亿人民高度发挥主观能动性、充分利用客观规律，多快好省地建设社会主义，也就是反对马克思列宁主义的革命性。而他们所说的“实事求是”恰恰是“自以为是”——这个“是”不是别的，正是资产阶级反对社会主义、恢复资本主义的愿望。
    什么是“实事求是”呢？
    毛泽东同志说：“‘实事’就是客观存在着的一切事物，‘是’就是客观事物的内部联系，即规律性，‘求’就是我们去研究。我们要从国内外、省内外、县内外、区内外的实际情况出发，从其中引出其固有的而不是臆造的规律性，即找出周围事变的内部联系，作为我们行动的向导。”
    作为总路线的思想基础的毛泽东思想，正是从我国国内外的实际情况出发，从其中引出了“固有的而不是臆造的规律性”，即社会主义经济和政治、文化发展的客观规律性。党的总路线所规定的基本点，正是把毛泽东同志所引出的我国社会主义经济、政治和文化发展的客观规律性，“作为我们行动的向导”，也就是高度发挥主观能动性，充分利用社会主义经济、政治和文化发展的客观规律性，加速社会主义建设，争取可能争取到的最高速度，争取可能争取到的最大胜利。
    充分利用社会主义经济和政治、文化发展的客观规律性的主体是谁呢？这个主体要有怎样的精神态度才能作到充分利用社会主义经济和政治、文化发展的客观规律呢？
    马克思列宁主义认为，人民群众是历史的创造者。当然，我国六亿人民群众也是我国社会主义政治、经济和文化的创造者。在党的领导下的六亿人民群众，是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的最主要、最伟大的主观力量。这个力量，就是利用社会主义经济和政治、文化发展规律，多快好省地建设社会主义的主体。所谓利用客观规律，就是把根据客观规律引出来的实际结论变成广大群众的行动，就是广大群众在正确的方针指导之下鼓足干劲力争上游地改造客观世界。离开了广大群众的这种主观能动性，就谈不到什么充分利用客观规律了。
    毛泽东同志在著名的“论持久战”中，在科学地分析了抗日战争的规律性之后一方面强调了正确的、符合客观实际的计划、方针、政策、战略、战术的重要性，同时，也反复地强调了从政治上动员军民的重要性，他说：“这个政治上动员军民的问题，实在太重要了。我们之所以不惜反反复复地说到这一点，实在是没有这一点就没有胜利。没有许多别的必要的东西固然也没有胜利，然而这是胜利的最基本的条件。”他还说：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”
    毛泽东同志的上述论断，正像列宁所讲过的，是把“非常科学的冷静的态度去分析客观形势和进化的客观进程”同“非常坚决地承认群众……的革命毅力，革命创造力、革命首创精神的意义卓越地结合起来的光辉典范。”它的基本精神，对于社会主义建设也是完全适用的。我们可以说，社会主义建设的“伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中”，六亿人民“鼓足干劲，力争上游”，这种伟大的革命的精神状态，“实在太重要了”，“实在是没有这一点就没有胜利。没有许多别的必要的东西固然也没有胜利，然而这是胜利的最基本的条件”。从1958年开始的轰轰烈烈的大跃进的群众革命运动，不是充分证明了这一点吗？
    右倾机会主义分子把“力争上游”和“实事求是”、尊重客观规律分割开来，绝对对立起来，正表明了他们以主观唯心主义的世界观来反对马克思主义的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的世界观。
    因为他们既然从历史唯心主义出发，必然会否定利用客观规律的主体——人民群众创造历史的伟大作用。
    他们既然否认了社会的主体——人民群众的作用，也就必然歪曲社会规律的概念。社会规律不是从社会外边加进来的异己力量，而是社会本身的运动规律。右倾机会主义者否认了社会的主体——人民群众的作用，所以他们的社会规律的概念也就成了宿命的东西。在他们看来，社会规律是和人的行动无关的、从社会外边加进来的异己力量，这种异己力量注定了某年某月某日某时某刻钢铁出产多少吨，粮食出产多少斤，既不能多一吨也不能少一吨，既不能多一斤也不能少一斤，干不干都是一样。在他们看来，没有什么力争上游不力争上游的问题，即根本不应该也不能“争”，人们只能听从命运的安排；所以在他们看来，“力争上游”就是违反“客观规律”，就是违背“实事求是”了。
    同右倾机会主义的这种“规律”观相反，马克思主义承认不以人的意志为转移的客观规律，丝毫也不意味着否认或低估人的主观能动性，而是把它们有机结合起来。正像毛泽东同志所说的：“马克思主义的哲学认为十分重要的问题，不在于懂得了客观世界的规律性，因而能够解释世界，而在于拿了这种对于客观规律性的认识去能动地改造世界。”党的总路线正是党认识了社会主义建设的客观规律性之后，动员群众能动地改造世界的最充分的表现。
    大家都知道，在同样的条件下，人们做出来的成绩可以不一样，甚至会大不一样。原因在哪里呢？就在于人们的干劲鼓得足不足，力争上游的革命精神够不够。两千多年前的管仲就说过：“不为不可成”，但“不务不成”。在客观条件许可的范围内，大干（即力争）就有大成就（即上游），小干只有小成就，不干就会无成就。这是为日常生活千万次证明过的常识。离开了“鼓足干劲，力争上游”，那还能有什么充分利用客观规律，“实事求是”可言呢？
    把“力争上游”和尊重客观规律、“实事求是”分割开来，绝对对立起来，把它们列于互相排斥的地位——这是右倾机会主义的唯心主义、宿命论的提法。他们既不“实事”（否认客观事实），也不“求是”，而是纯粹的自以为是；他们这个“是”，是完全违背客观规律的主观捏造的宿命论，破坏人民群众的革命精神状态的武器。
    把“力争上游”和利用客观规律、“实事求是”统一起来，才是马克思列宁主义的观点。党的总路线，正是把两者恰当地统一起来的路线，正充分体现了马克思主义的科学性和革命性相结合的特色。
    所以实质上，问题并不像右倾机会主义者所提的那样：是要“力争上游”呢，还是要“实事求是”呢？问题倒是这样的：是要“实事求是”、“力争上游”呢，还是要宿命论从而破坏人民群众革命的精神状态呢？
    “鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”，真是字字千金，它造成了全国人民群众高昂的伟大的革命精神状态，充分发挥了利用客观规律加速社会主义建设的主观能动性，造成了史无前例的轰轰烈烈的大跃进。右倾机会主义者打着“实事求是”的招牌，反对“力争上游”，则是站在资产阶级立场上，反对马克思主义的革命性（当然，因此也是反对它的科学性），企图瓦解六亿人民的意气风发的冲天干劲，企图破坏六亿人民的“力争上游”的伟大革命气概和伟大革命精神，而恢复资本主义的逆流。因此，我们必须彻底粉碎右倾机会主义的滥调，干劲永远要鼓足，上游永远要力争。
