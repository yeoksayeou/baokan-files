Xinhua News Agency report: Newspapers in Vietnam, Korea, and Bulgaria continue to publish commentaries condemning the United States' manipulation of the United Nations to interfere in Laos' internal affairs and its conspiracy to create tension in Southeast Asia.

    The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary on November 8th, stating that the so-called United Nations Security Council "Sub-Committee on the Investigation of the Situation in Laos" had to admit in its "report" submitted on November 6th that the "Sub-Committee" could not clearly confirm the involvement of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's troops in Laos; nor could it clearly confirm the Lao government's claim that North Vietnamese troops crossed the border on September 15th and occupied Ma Jiang and parts of the Lao-Vietnamese border area. This is yet another slap in the face to the US imperialists and the pro-American reactionary clique within the Sananikone government.

    The commentary stated that the facts in Laos are as clear as daylight: there are no troops from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam carrying out so-called "interference" and "aggression" in Laos. The main culprits who are interfering in Laos and creating tension there are none other than the US imperialist aggressors. The reason why the United Nations "Investigation Sub-Committee" did not dare to mention this fact in its "investigation report" is that the members of this "investigation sub-committee" include only members of one side, and its illegal establishment was intended to cover up US imperialist intervention in Laos, so how could it conduct an objective investigation?

    The commentary stated, "Obviously, the United Nations' interference in Laos will not only fail to solve the Lao problem but will also make the situation in Laos even more serious. Isn't it precisely by taking advantage of the United Nations' violation of the Geneva Accords on Laos and the usurpation of the authority of the International Commission for Laos that the US imperialist aggressors and the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc headed by them are stepping up their intervention in Laos, clamoring to expand the civil war in Laos, and preparing to send troops to Laos?"

    The commentary pointed out, "The essence of the Lao problem is the Lao people's struggle against US imperialist intervention, against the corruption of the Sananikone government, and for the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements signed between the Lao Royal Government and the Lao Patriotic Forces."

    In discussing the correct path to solving the Lao problem, the commentary stated that Soviet Premier Khrushchev pointed out at the recent session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union that the situation in Laos can be restored to normal, as long as a sensible attitude is adopted and international agreements are observed. The important thing is that the major powers do not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

    The Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly also issued a statement pointing out that the activities of the International Commission for Laos must be resumed as soon as possible. If the International Commission for Laos does not resume its activities in the near future, the participating countries of the Geneva Conference should convene a meeting without delay to discuss the current situation in Laos. The commentary said that this is the only way to solve the Lao problem, and it is also the position and desire of the Lao people, the Vietnamese people, and the peace-loving people of Asia, Africa, and the world. All conspiracies to use the United Nations to interfere in Laos will only make the situation in Laos even more serious.

    The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an article on November 8th, stating that the US imperialists suffered a new major defeat because the so-called "Sub-Committee on the Investigation of the Situation in Laos" dispatched by the United Nations Security Council was unable to fabricate any evidence to prove their so-called "aggression" of Laos by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    The article pointed out that the facts once again show that whenever the US imperialists launch an aggression themselves, they groundlessly trot out the old tune of the so-called "communist threat."

    The article demanded the immediate dissolution of the "Investigation Sub-Committee."

    The article also called on the United Nations Security Council to correct its error of being used by US imperialists as a tool to interfere in Laos and to prevent this from happening again under the control of the US aggressive bloc.

    The Bulgarian "Rabotnichesko Delo" published a commentary on November 9th, stating that it is now completely clear that the cause of the events in Laos is by no means the fabricated so-called "interference" from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but the anti-popular crimes of the Sananikone government.

    The commentary refuted the shameless clamor of certain Western newspapers. These newspapers were greatly disappointed by the failure to find evidence of the so-called "aggression of Laos by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam" and are now clamoring for the establishment of a "permanent investigation team in Laos." The commentary said that there is no reason to establish such an investigation team at all. In order to establish peace in Laos, the causes of the ongoing civil war must be eliminated. To this end, the Lao Sananikone government must abide by the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, release the Lao patriots led by Souphanouvong, and restore the activities of the International Commission.

### 越朝保舆论谴责联合国干涉老挝内政  “调查报告”反打了美萨集团耳光  老挝当局必须严格遵守日内瓦协议和万象协议

    越朝保舆论谴责联合国干涉老挝内政
    “调查报告”反打了美萨集团耳光
    老挝当局必须严格遵守日内瓦协议和万象协议
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：越、朝、保等国报纸继续发表评论，谴责美国操纵联合国干涉老挝内政，在东南亚制造紧张局势的阴谋。
    越南“人民报”8日发表评论说，所谓联合国安全理事会“调查老挝局势小组委员会”11月6日在它提出的“报告”中，不得不承认，“小组委员会”不能明确证实越南民主共和国的军队干涉老挝；也不能明确证实老挝政府所说的北越军队在9月15日越境侵占马江和老越边界部分地区。这就再一次打了美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府中的亲美反动集团一记耳光。
    评论说，老挝的事实已经明如白昼，那就是没有越南民主共和国的军队在老挝进行所谓“干涉”和“侵略”。干涉老挝和制造老挝紧张局势的元凶正是美帝国主义侵略者。联合国“调查小组委员会”在它的“调查报告”中所以不敢提到这一事实，是因为这个“调查小组委员会”的成员仅仅包括一方的成员，它非法成立的目的，是为了给美帝国主义干涉老挝作掩护，那它又怎能够客观地进行调查呢？
    评论说，“显然，联合国干涉老挝，不但不能解决老挝问题，反而使老挝局势变得更加严重。美帝国主义侵略者和以它为首的东南亚侵略集团不正是利用联合国违反关于老挝的日内瓦协议和侵夺老挝国际委员会的权力的机会，而加紧干涉老挝、叫嚣扩大老挝内战和准备出兵老挝吗？”
    评论指出，“老挝问题的实质，是老挝人民为反对美帝国主义的干涉，反对萨纳尼空政府的腐败，为要求严格履行日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同寮国战斗部队签订的万象协议而斗争。”
    评论在谈到正确解决老挝问题的途径时说，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在最近举行的苏联最高苏维埃会议上曾经指出，老挝的局势是能够恢复正常的，只要采取明智的态度和遵守国际协议。重要的是，各大国不干涉别国的内政。
    苏联出席联合国大会代表团也曾经发表声明指出，必须尽速恢复老挝国际委员会的活动。如果老挝国际委员会不在最近期间恢复活动，日内瓦会议参加国就应刻不容缓地开会来讨论老挝当前的局势。评论说，这是解决老挝问题的唯一道路，也是老挝人民、越南人民、亚非和全世界爱好和平的人民的立场和愿望。利用联合国来干涉老挝的一切阴谋，只会使老挝局势变得更加严重。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”8日发表文章说，由于联合国安全理事会派遣的所谓“调查老挝局势小组委员会”没有能够制造出任何证据，来证明他们的所谓越南民主共和国“侵略”老挝的谰言，美帝国主义者遭受了一次新的大失败。
    文章指出，事实再一次表明，每当美帝国主义者自己发动侵略的时候，就毫无根据地玩弄起所谓“共产党威胁”这套滥调。
    文章要求立即解散“调查小组委员会”。
    文章还要求联合国安全理事会纠正它的由于它被美帝国主义者利用为干涉老挝的工具这种错误，并且要求防止在美国侵略集团控制下再次发生这种情况。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”9日发表评论说，现在已经完全清楚，老挝事件发生的原因绝不是臆造的来自越南民主共和国的所谓“干涉”，而是萨纳尼空政府的反人民的罪行。
    评论驳斥了某些西方报纸的无耻叫嚣。这些报纸对没有发现所谓“越南民主共和国侵略老挝”的证据一事大为失望，现在又叫嚷什么“在老挝建立常设调查小组”。评论说，根本没有建立这种调查小组的理由。为了在老挝建立和平，必须消除现在正在进行的内战的原因。为此，老挝萨纳尼空政府必须遵守日内瓦协议和万象协议，释放以苏发努冯为首的老挝爱国者，恢复国际委员会的活动。
