Heroic Anecdotes

    Liu Jinjie, the Aerial Expert
    Feet treading on clouds, head touching the sky,
    Waist tied with a treasure belt, hanging amidst the clouds,
    The electrician fears no difficulties,
    Erecting poles on the Motian Ridge;
    Liu Jinjie, the aerial expert,
    Stringing high-voltage wires across the river,
    Sending electricity to the three towns of Wuhan,
    Where the leap forward of workers and peasants fills the gardens with flowers.

This poem praises a hero from the gathering of heroes. In October of last year, Liu Jinjie joined the ranks of the power construction team, becoming a worker in the transmission and transformation engineering department of the Hubei Provincial Electric Power Construction Bureau. It was joy upon joy, as he was assigned the task of erecting China's first high-voltage transmission line across the Yangtze River upon joining the electric power construction team. The first step of the work was to build a work platform on the electricity tower, which was more than 140 meters high. Performing high-altitude work on this tower, equivalent to a forty-story building, was a new experience for everyone on the construction site. But whether or not the work platform could be built on the tower was a decisive key to completing the task of erecting the transmission line. At the time, Liu Jinjie was also a little timid, but when he thought that this trans-river line would supply millions of kilowatt-hours of electricity to the three towns of Wuhan every day, which was of great significance for supporting the leap forward of industry and agriculture, he unhesitatingly took on this job.

Due to his ingenuity and bravery in his work, he not only overcame many difficulties, but also created a set of methods of "climbing the top layer, swinging the middle layer, and walking the bottom layer," and finally built the first work platform in eight hours. Later, he and his partners together hoisted iron cross arms weighing eight tons to the top of the high tower and erected a twelve-meter-long seamless steel pipe on the top of the tower.

In the project of erecting the trans-river line, he achieved safety with no accidents, good quality, and completed the task half a month ahead of schedule. People on the construction site compared him to the climbing hero Yang Liandi and wrote the preceding poem to praise him.

### 空中能人刘金阶

专栏：英雄诗话

    空中能人刘金阶
    脚踏云采头顶天，
    腰系宝带挂云间，
    电工不怕困难多，
    摩天岭上立抱杆；
    空中能人刘金阶，
    高空架线过江来，
    送电武汉三镇间，
    工农跃进花满园。
    这首诗歌唱的是群英会上的一位英雄。去年10月，刘金阶参加了电力建设队伍，当上了湖北省电力建设局送变电工程处的工人。真是喜中之喜，一参加电力建设的队伍，就接受了架设我国第一条横跨长江的高压输电线的任务。工作的第一个回合，就是在高达一百四十多米的电塔上搭设工作台。在这座相当于四十层楼房高的电塔上进行高空作业，这对工地上所有的人来说都是一件新事。但是能不能在塔上搭起工作台来，对完成输电线架设任务是一个决定性的关键。当时刘金阶也有些胆怯，但他想到这条跨江线每天要供给武汉三镇数百万度电，对支援工农业跃进有着重大意义的时候，就毫不犹豫地把这份工作担当起来了。
    由于他在工作当中的机智和勇敢，不仅克服了许多困难，而且还创造了一套“顶层爬，中层荡，底层走”的方法，终于在八小时内就把第一个工作台搭起来了。后来，他又同伙伴们一起，把重达八吨的铁横担吊装上高高的塔顶，把十二米长的无缝钢管竖立在塔顶上。
    在架设跨江线的工程中，他做到了安全无事故，质量良好，并提前半个月完成了任务。工地上的人们都把他和登高英雄杨连第比，写下了前面这首诗来赞美他。
