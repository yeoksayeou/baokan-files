The Former Course of the Yellow River: A New Base for Fruit Tree Production in China

The Yellow River has changed its course several times, flowing through 88 counties in Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong, turning 15 million mu of fertile land into endless beaches and countless sand dunes of various sizes.

However, this area has a mild climate, ample sunshine, and no severe winter frost, so fruit trees such as grapes and pomegranates can overwinter in the open. The soil here is brown earth and loam, which is generally suitable for fruit tree growth.

In the ten years since liberation, thanks to the efforts of Party committees at all levels and the broad masses, the management of existing fruit trees in this area has been greatly improved, and yields have increased year after year. At the same time, large-scale orchards have continued to emerge. As of now, 2.89 million mu of fruit trees have been planted in the former course area. Due to the continuous establishment of new-style orchards and the continuous improvement of cultivation techniques, not only has the yield per unit area increased rapidly, but the varieties of fruit trees have also undergone great changes. At present, in addition to the original jujubes, persimmons, pears, and other fruit trees, apples and grapes with higher economic value are being widely developed. Taking the Yifeng Horticultural Farm in Henan as an example, in the past, there were only more jujubes and persimmons here. Since the establishment of the horticultural farm, it has become a major apple and grape producing area. This year, the total apple output is 300,000 jin, and the annual grape output has reached 2 million jin, an increase of more than two times compared with last year, not only meeting local needs but also supplying East China and Northeast provinces.

Recently, the relevant provinces in the Yellow River's former course area have trained a large number of technical cadres and established fruit tree professional teams in accordance with the overall development plan. The Fruit Tree Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has also organized technical personnel from the four provinces in the former course area to establish the Yellow River's Former Course Area Fruit Tree Technology Committee to guide and carry out technical research activities and summarize the experience of cultivating fruit trees in the sandy wasteland of the former course.

    黄河故道我国果树生产的新基地
    黄河历次改道，流经河南、安徽、江苏、山东的八十八个县，使一千五百万亩良田，都变成一望无尽的沙滩和数不尽的大小沙丘。
    但是，这个地区气候温和，日照充足，冬季没有严重冻害，像葡萄、石榴等果树，都可以露地越冬。这里的土壤为褐土和壤土，一般适宜于果树生长。
    解放十年来，这个地区经过各级党委和广大群众的努力，大大改进了原有果树的经营管理，产量连年增加；同时，大型果园也不断涌现。故道地区到目前为止，已栽培果树二百八十九万亩。由于新式果园的不断建立，栽培技术不断提高，不仅单位面积产量有了迅速增加，果树品种也起了很大的变化。目前，除了原有的枣、柿、梨等果木外，经济价值较高的苹果、葡萄正在广泛发展。以河南仪封园艺场为例，过去这里只是有较多的枣、柿，自从建立园艺场后，成为苹果、葡萄盛产区，今年苹果总产三十万斤，葡萄年产量已达二百万斤，比去年增产二倍以上，不但满足当地需要，还供应华东及东北各省。
    最近，黄河故道地区有关的省，根据全面发展规划，训练了大批的技术干部，成立了果树专业队。中国科学院果树研究所还组织了故道地区四省的技术人员，成立黄河故道地区果树技术委员会，指导开展技术研究活动，总结故道沙荒栽培果树经验。
