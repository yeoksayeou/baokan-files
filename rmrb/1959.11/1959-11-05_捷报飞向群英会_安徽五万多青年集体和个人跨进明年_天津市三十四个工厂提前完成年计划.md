Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, November 4th: Youth workers on the industrial and transportation front in Anhui Province are vigorously launching a high-speed campaign to leap into 1960 in order to fulfill or overfulfill their annual production tasks and present new production achievements to the National "Heroes' Congress". According to preliminary statistics, 1,126 youth collectives and 57,061 youth advanced producers and youth workers across the province have already leaped into 1960 at high speed.

After studying and discussing the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the youth workers in Anhui Province further opposed right-leaning tendencies and boosted their energy. They not only learned from and caught up with the advanced with soaring enthusiasm, but also carried out activities in which the advanced helped the less advanced to leap forward together. 150,000 youth workers in the province participated in this activity, of which 806 youth collectives and 40,000 youth have made remarkable achievements. Some of them are already working on the tasks for 1961, 1962, and even 1964. For example, the Youth Small Blast Furnace of the Wuhu Jiangnan Automobile Factory, which was recently rated as a red flag unit in the national iron and steel enterprises, completed its annual production task four months and seventeen days ahead of schedule in mid-August, leaping into 1960 at high speed. Zhang Kezhong, a young carpenter and technical innovation expert in Ma'anshan, worked hard, boldly created various advanced tools such as electric small wheel saws, greatly improved labor efficiency, and completed five years and forty-eight days of work in eight and a half months.

At the same time, the vast number of young workers throughout the province also widely launched red flag competitions to establish, learn from, and catch up with pace-setters in terms of quality, high yield, conservation, and safety, striving to comprehensively overfulfill the state's annual production plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 4th: The broad masses of workers in Tianjin continue to create new achievements to present to the National Heroes' Congress. According to incomplete statistics so far, thirty-four factories in the city have completed this year's production plans ahead of schedule, and 827 youth collectives and more than 28,200 young workers have entered 1960 ahead of schedule.

Good news keeps coming to the Heroes' Congress, and the representatives participating in the Heroes' Congress also keep sending the good news of "learning from experience" back to the factories. The Tianjin Alloy Steel Factory, which was born in the Great Leap Forward last year, completed its annual task ahead of schedule on October 25th with giant strides this year, presenting a generous gift to the Heroes' Congress. After opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting their energy, the Hongqi Chemical Plant, whose production leaped again and again, launched a production upsurge to present a gift to the Heroes' Congress. It innovated a large number of technologies, turning 45% of manual operations in the plant into mechanized and semi-mechanized operations, thus ensuring that the plant's October production was red day by day and ten-day period by ten-day period. It not only completed the October production plan ahead of schedule, but also completed the annual production task ahead of schedule on October 29th. When Yu Junfeng, a young shoemaker at the Hongyuan Shoe Factory, went to Beijing to participate in the Heroes' Congress, the workers of the "Ten Sisters Group" where she worked proposed to take over the workload left by their elder sister Yu Junfeng, and to complete the monthly plan ahead of schedule as a gift to the Heroes' Congress. Subsequently, the entire group launched a vigorous competition, and the daily output quickly increased to 200 pairs, finally realizing their promise ahead of schedule. The advanced collective attending the Heroes' Congress—the forging team of the Tianjin Papermaking Machinery Factory—recently completed three months of work in nineteen days. The team immediately telegraphed this good news to their representative Zhang Wenbo. After receiving Zhang Wenbo's letter, they proposed to repay the honor given to the team by the Party with practical actions, researched and improved the die, and completed a hundred and twenty hours of urgent tasks in just six hours.

Good news from the transportation front also keeps coming one after another. The staff of the city's public transportation system completed the October transportation task two days ahead of schedule, and the daily output increased from one ten-day period to the next. The fleet where Gao Huchen, the famous fuel-saving expert attending the Heroes' Congress, is located, saved more than 4,600 liters of gasoline in the past twenty-six days due to learning Gao Huchen's advanced experience.

    捷报飞向群英会
    安徽五万多青年集体和个人跨进明年
    天津市三十四个工厂提前完成年计划
    新华社合肥4日电　安徽省工业交通战线上的青年职工，为完成或超额完成全年的生产任务，轰轰烈烈地展开高速度跨进1960年的活动，以新的生产成就向全国“群英会”献礼。据目前初步统计，全省已有一千一百二十六个青年集体、五万七千零六十一名青年先进生产者和青年工人高速度跨进了1960年。
    安徽省青年职工在学习和讨论了党的八届八中全会的文件以后，进一步反右倾、鼓干劲，不仅以冲天的干劲学先进、赶先进，还开展了先进帮落后共同跃进的活动。全省参加这一活动的青年职工有十五万人，其中有八百零六个青年集体和四万名青年已作出了显著成绩。他们中有的人已经在做1961年、1962年、甚至1964年的工作了。例如不久以前被评为全国钢铁企业红旗单位的芜湖江南汽车厂青年小高炉，在8月中旬就提前四个月零十七天完成了全年生产任务，高速度地跨进了1960年。马鞍山青年木工、技术革新能手张克忠，刻苦钻研，大胆创造了电动小轮锯等多种先进工具，大大提高了劳动效率，以八个半月的时间完成了五年零四十八天的工作量。
    与此同时，全省广大青年职工还在优质、高产、节约、安全等方面，广泛地开展了树标兵、学标兵、赶标兵的红旗竞赛。为全面超额完成国家全年生产计划而奋斗。
    新华社天津4日电　天津市广大职工不断创造新的成就向全国群英会献礼。到目前为止的不完全统计，全市已有三十四个工厂提前完成了今年的生产计划，并且有八百二十七个青年集体和二万八千二百多名青年工人提前跨入1960年。
    捷报不断送到群英会，参加群英会的代表们也不断把“取经”的好消息传回各工厂。在去年大跃进中诞生的天津合金钢厂，今年以巨人的步伐在10月25日提前完成了全年任务，向群英会献了厚礼。反右倾、鼓干劲以后，生产一跃再跃的红旗化工厂，掀起了向群英会献礼的生产高潮，革新了大批技术，使全厂45％的手工操作变为机械化和半机械化，从而保证了全厂10月生产日日红、旬旬红，不仅提前完成了10月份的生产计划，而且在10月29日提前完成了全年的生产任务。洪垣制鞋厂青年?鞋工人于俊凤去北京参加群英会的时候，她所在的“十姐妹小组”的工人提出，要包下大姐于俊凤留下的工作量，并且要提前完成月度计划向群英会献礼；随后全组开展了热火朝天的竞赛，日产量迅速提高到二百双，终于提前实现了自己的诺言。出席群英会的先进集体——天津造纸机械厂锻工小组，在最近以十九天的时间完成了三个月的工作量，小组立即把这个喜讯拍电报告诉了他们的代表张文波；他们收到张文波的来信以后，又提出要以实际行动来报答党给予小组的荣誉，研究和改进了胎具，只用六个小时就完成了一百二十个小时的紧急任务。
    运输战线上的捷报也是一个接着一个。全市公共交通运输系统的职工，提前两天完成了10月份的运输任务，并且使日产量一旬高过一旬。出席群英会的著名节油能手高虎臣所在的车队，由于学习了高虎臣的先进经验，在最近二十六天中就节约了汽油四千六百多公升。
