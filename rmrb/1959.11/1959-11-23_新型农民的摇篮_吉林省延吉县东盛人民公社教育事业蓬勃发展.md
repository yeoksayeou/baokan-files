    Cradle of New-Type Peasants
    ——Flourishing Education in the Dongsheng People's Commune, Yanji County, Jilin Province
          Everyone is Busy with Production, Everywhere is the Sound of Reading
    “Everyone is busy with production, everywhere is the sound of reading.” This is the new scene of production and cultural life in the Dongsheng People's Commune, Yanji County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province. Over the past year, while making great leaps forward in production, they have established two agricultural middle schools and popularized junior middle school education, in addition to the original nine public primary schools and one public junior middle school. They have eliminated illiteracy among adults, further developed spare-time primary and secondary schools, and established a spare-time agricultural university, enabling 83% of the commune's young and middle-aged people to participate in spare-time studies in different classes.
    The Dongsheng People's Commune is located on the banks of the Hailan River in Yanji County and is a multi-ethnic united commune where Koreans and Han Chinese live together. Before liberation, the people here suffered cruel exploitation and oppression by Japanese imperialism and feudal forces, living a miserable life with insufficient clothing and half a year of meager food. They suffered severe devastation in culture, the Korean people had no freedom to learn their own language and writing, let alone the development of education. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, people of all ethnic groups embarked on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. Starting from organizing mutual aid teams, illiteracy gradually became a difficulty in the work. Take the then head of the mutual aid team, now the commune's director and national model worker, Jin Shirong, for example. Because he was illiterate, he had to rely on his memory to record the exchange of labor within the team, and he had to draw symbols when there were too many things to remember. He drew people for work and cattle horns for livestock, and after a long time, he himself became confused. At this time, the Party issued a call for a literacy campaign, and Jin Shirong and the masses actively participated in literacy learning. From then on, the peasants' literacy movement began. Under the promotion of the government's vigorous development of education, various educational undertakings have been greatly developed. In July 1956, primary school education was universalized throughout the township. With the development of secondary education, in the past two or three years, more than two hundred children of peasants have graduated from junior or senior high school every year, and there are already forty-nine senior high school graduates who have returned to their hometown to participate in agricultural production. In terms of spare-time education, by the end of 1957, all cadres above the level of production team leader in the township had reached the cultural level of higher primary school or above, illiteracy had been eliminated among 95% of the young and middle-aged peasants, 551 people had reached the cultural level of junior high school, and 43 people had reached the cultural level of senior high school.
    With the development of production and the improvement of people's material life, they not only demanded to continue to improve their culture, but also urgently demanded to learn science and technology in order to better solve the new technical problems that arise in production. Especially in the great leap forward in production in 1958, the old production targets were broken, and new and higher production targets were put forward. To build water conservancy projects, apply fertilizer rationally, carry out deep plowing on a large scale, comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and gradually realize agricultural mechanization (there are already four tractors), the masses felt that it was impossible without science and technology. At this time, the people's commune, which combined workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and integrated government and commune, was born. The establishment of the people's commune opened up a broad road for commune-run education.
          Four Major Advantages of Commune-Run Schools
    (1) The commune has a large scale and a wide range, which is conducive to mobilizing all positive forces to run education. In the past, agricultural cooperatives were small in scale and weak in strength, and could only manage production but not education. After the establishment of the commune, the organization became larger and stronger, and two agricultural middle schools were quickly established, enrolling 315 students. They were all graduates of higher primary schools under the age of sixteen who could not enter public middle schools when they were in the advanced cooperatives. The commune made unified plans for funds, mobilized the masses, and contributed manpower and effort. The masses and students worked together and completed the construction of school buildings that could accommodate 350 students and dormitories for 100 people in just over a month. They also withdrew 15% of the public welfare fund as a spare-time education fund to solve the funding problem. The commune also allocated and hired 15 agricultural middle school teachers and selected 255 teachers for various spare-time schools. The spare-time university hired the commune party secretary to teach political classes, the commune director Jin Shirong to teach commune management classes, the student Lü Genze, who has eight years of rice cultivation experience, to teach rice cultivation technology classes, and invited teachers from the Yanbian Agricultural College to teach basic courses, and also invited experienced old farmers to guide production practice. The commune members said: "With the people's commune, running schools is like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each showing their special abilities."
      (2) People's communes run various welfare undertakings, which is conducive to the development of spare-time education. Because the commune has vigorously run public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, most women have been freed from tedious housework and can have more time to participate in spare-time learning. In the past, only 30% of the women in the Dongsheng management area participated in spare-time learning, and they were only doing it "three days fishing and two days drying nets". Now 76% of women can regularly participate in spare-time learning. After the establishment of the commune, 67 spare-time primary school classes, 42 spare-time junior high school classes, and 10 spare-time senior high school classes were added. In this way, the number of people participating in spare-time learning increased by 882 compared with before the establishment of the commune. Sixteen senior high school graduates, because they were the main labor force in the family in the past and their economic conditions were not sufficient, could not study in regular universities, but now they can produce and study in the commune's spare-time agricultural university.
      (3) Commune-run schools are more conducive to combining education with productive labor and combining mental labor with physical labor. The commune's spare-time agricultural university, spare-time primary and secondary schools, and agricultural middle schools are mainly to cultivate new-type peasants who are directly engaged in commune production. Therefore, the content of learning is arranged according to the production needs of the commune, "do what, learn what", and the combination of politics, culture, and technology is implemented. The commune allocated 14 hectares of paddy fields, 18 hectares of dry land, 3 hectares of orchards, 10 draft cattle, and 3 carts to the agricultural middle school and spare-time university as the students' production base. The students of the spare-time university also formed six research groups: crops, plant protection, soil and agricultural chemistry, horticulture, agricultural machinery, and surveying, according to the production needs of the commune. Last winter, they used the chemical knowledge they learned to manufacture 500 tons of homemade explosives during deep plowing and water conservancy construction. This year, they researched and created 35 kinds of homemade pesticides according to the common diseases and insect pests of local crops. They also planted five mu of excellent varieties of rice experimental fields and tested 12 varieties of rice. They established a rice water demand measurement station and prepared to solve the determination of rice water demand within two years, combined with experiments and research, and wrote more than 40 articles. For example, the students jointly compiled the book "Folk Pesticide Production Method" based on the experience of old farmers, and are soliciting the opinions of old farmers for further modification and supplementation. The book "Questions and Answers on Rice Cultivation Techniques" compiled by student Lü Genze has been published by the Yanbian Science and Technology Association and is very popular among readers. The masses praised and said: "The students taught by commune-run schools can speak and do, and are both literary and martial."
      (4) The commune is convenient for making overall arrangements for production and education and providing unified leadership, so that education can be subordinate to production and serve the needs of production. The people's commune leads both the economy and culture; it manages both production and education. The commune party committee strengthened the unified leadership of education and incorporated education into the party committee's agenda. In leading education, the party committee first guarantees the completion of production tasks, so that learning is closely combined with production and serves production. In the organization of production and learning, the two are unified. The commune concentrates the spare-time university students scattered in various management areas and organizes them into a directly affiliated production team. They have fixed draught animals, land, orchards, and farm tools, and undertake the production tasks uniformly assigned by the commune. The classes and groups of spare-time middle and primary schools are also production technology research groups. In terms of learning methods, flexible and diverse methods are adopted. In the time arrangement of production and education, the principle of "learn more when you are less busy, learn less when you are busy, and don't learn when you are too busy" is resolutely implemented. For example, during the particularly busy rice transplanting period, spare-time schools at all levels stop learning and concentrate on completing the rice transplanting task; during the tense stages of spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvest, the method of combining classroom learning and field learning is adopted, and only four or five hours of learning are conducted each week; in winter, seven or eight hours of learning per week are generally insisted on; when going out to engage in sideline production, the method of taking tasks, bringing books, and following teachers is adopted, and learning wherever you go. Therefore, although 2,543 young and middle-aged peasants in the commune participated in spare-time learning, it did not affect production labor, and they insisted on year-round spare-time learning, achieving the goal of not delaying production and learning. The two agricultural middle schools, because they insisted on part-time work and part-time study, have achieved economic self-sufficiency, reduced the burden on the commune and parents, and learned a lot of scientific and cultural knowledge and production knowledge. The commune implements unified leadership and hierarchical management of schools at all levels and of all types: the commune is responsible for managing public middle and primary schools, agricultural middle schools, and spare-time universities; the management area is responsible for managing spare-time middle schools; the production team is responsible for managing spare-time primary schools. The commune party committee also piloted a spare-time central school from primary school to senior high school in the Dongsheng management area in order to gain experience and guide the overall situation.
      Development of Education and Change of Ideological Outlook
    Over the past year, due to the unprecedented favorable conditions brought about by the people's commune, the various educational undertakings in the commune have made significant progress. At present, the commune has nine public full-time primary schools and one junior high school; two private part-time agricultural middle schools (including one senior high school class); spare-time education includes 141 primary school classes, 122 junior high school classes, 12 senior high school classes, and one spare-time agricultural university. In this way, the commune has both public and private schools; both full-time and part-time and spare-time schools; and both popularization and improvement. It is precisely because of walking on two legs that educational undertakings have been developed in a faster, better, and more economical way. The commune now has 4,601 students in full-time and part-time schools, an increase of 22% compared with before the establishment of the commune; and 2,940 students in spare-time schools, an increase of 43% compared with before the establishment of the commune. Among the 3,238 households in the commune, a total of 7,541 students participate in learning in schools at all levels and of all types, averaging three primary school students for every two households, two middle school students for every three households, and one university student for every thirty households.
    The comprehensive development of education has greatly changed people's ideological outlook and further improved the socialist ideological consciousness of commune members. In particular, after the peasants have mastered scientific and cultural knowledge, they further believe in science and believe in their own strength. For example, in the past, rice was generally threshed with foot-operated threshing machines, with three people pedaling one machine, getting up early and working late, and their backs ached, and they could only thresh 4,000 jin of rice a day. It is completely different after having culture. Jin Bingqian, who did not know a single character in the past, tried to make an animal-powered threshing machine after attending spare-time junior high school, and the efficiency was doubled. After the scientific and technological level of the masses has been improved, the conservative thinking has been greatly reduced, and they accept new things faster. The commune adopted a series of new technologies and advanced experiences in this year's agricultural production. The old farming methods were reformed, and deep plowing was implemented; the oil paper warm bed seedling raising method was popularized, and the rice transplanting period was advanced; and the three-by-six, four-corner, and triangular rice close planting methods were promoted. It is precisely because of the promotion of this series of new technologies that they overcame the difficulties and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. This year, the total grain output of the commune can reach more than 23,163,000 jin, an increase of 16% compared with the bumper harvest of 1958, creating the highest record of grain output in the Hailan River Plain in more than 100 years of development. The production of the spare-time university is even better. The students used glass warm bed seedling raising according to the technology they learned, and transplanted rice twenty days earlier; they implemented single-row single-irrigation to increase the water temperature; prevented rice blast; and carried out rational fertilization. Therefore, their crops are the best in the commune. The average rice yield per hectare can reach 13,000 jin, which is 4,000 jin more than the average yield of the commune. When the commune members saw that the rice of the university grew well, they went to the university in groups of three or two to let the university students introduce the experience of high yield. When the commune members encounter problems in production, they come to them for help. This summer, the high-yield rice fields of the Youth Satellite Team in the Longshan Management Area were overly green and did not heading, and the production team leader ran to the university several times in a row. The teachers and students of the spare-time university conducted a special study on this issue and proposed to use the "superphosphate foliar fertilizer application method" to make the rice develop normally. They not only achieved a bumper harvest in production, but also achieved great results in learning. At the end of August this year, the spare-time university used the examination questions of the Yanbian Agricultural College as the final examination, and the results showed that among the 46 students who participated in the examination, 7 were excellent, 20 were good, 18 were qualified, and only one was unqualified, which was well received by the masses. Through spare-time education, the commune also cultivated 527 technical talents in various fields such as tractor drivers, agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, fishery, and forestry. They have become the technical backbone of various production fronts. Li Wanyu, who used to be a feeder, began to study veterinary medicine after becoming literate. After several years of hard study and hard work, he is now a veterinarian who can treat cattle, horses, sheep, chickens, rabbits. Jin Shirong, who used to be illiterate and drew people and cattle horns to record work points, can now not only write work summary reports in Korean, but also understand general Chinese books and newspapers. Lü Genze, who graduated from junior high school eight years ago, has gained some experience in rice seedling raising, irrigation, fertilization, and close planting through years of spare-time learning and hard research, and has become a rice cultivation expert.
    The development of education has also enriched the cultural life of the broad masses of commune members. The commune has a spare-time cultural troupe, each management area has a club, and each team has spare-time actors. Most of the songs and dances performed are arranged by themselves. In addition, there are 120 newspaper reading groups, and commune members subscribe to 1,481 copies of newspapers and magazines; the 14 libraries have tens of thousands of books loved by the masses; the commune also has a wired broadcasting station with 500 loudspeakers, so that commune members can often hear major events at home and abroad. Literary and artistic creation is also very active, and the students have written many folk songs, essays, songs, scripts and other works. More than 200 articles have been published in magazines such as "Hailan River" and "Changbai Mountain" and Yanbian Daily. The sanitary conditions here have also changed greatly. People have the habits and knowledge of hygiene and disease prevention. The previously prevalent typhus has been eradicated. With the improvement of cultural life, sports activities are also very active. Each management area has football and volleyball teams, and small-scale sports competitions are often held during festivals and rest. The content of the competition is fresh and diverse, including ball games, track and field, as well as national forms such as swings, springboards, and wrestling.
    In the future, with the rapid development of production, the commune's education will continue to move forward in big steps. In this winter and next spring, focusing on the central tasks of the Party, we must eliminate the few remaining illiterates, vigorously improve and develop spare-time schools at all levels and of all types, and launch a new upsurge of learning. In addition to learning their own national language, Korean students must also learn Chinese. Now it seems that as long as we persist and continue to develop, it is not a distant thing for every member of the commune to become a new-type peasant with socialist consciousness and scientific culture.

    新型农民的摇篮
    ——吉林省延吉县东盛人民公社教育事业蓬勃发展
          人人忙生产　处处读书声
    “人人生产忙，处处读书声”。这是吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州延吉县东盛人民公社生产建设和文化生活的新景象。一年来，他们在生产大跃进的同时，在原有的九所公办小学和一所公办初中的基础上，兴办了两所农业中学，普及了初中教育。在成年人中扫除文盲，进一步发展了业余小学、中学，并且创办了一所业余农业大学，使全社83％的青壮年参加了不同班级的业余学习。
    东盛人民公社位于延吉县境内的海兰江畔，是朝鲜族、汉族杂居的民族联合社。解放前，这里的人民饱受日本帝国主义和封建势力的残酷剥削和压迫，过着衣不遮体糠菜半年粮的悲惨生活。在文化上更受到严重的摧残，朝鲜民族没有学习自己语言文字的自由，更谈不到教育事业的发展。解放后，在党的领导下，经过土地改革，各族人民走上了互助合作的道路。从组织互助组起，不识字逐渐成为工作中的一个困难了。就拿当时的互助组长现在的公社社长、全国劳动模范金时龙来说，由于不识字，组里换工记账都凭脑子记，事情多了记不住，只好画符号。出工画人，用牲口画牛角，时间一久自己也糊涂了。正在这时党发出了识字运动的号召，金时龙和广大群众一道积极参加了识字学习。从此农民的识字运动开展起来了。在政府大力兴办教育的推动下，各项教育事业得到了大发展。1956年7月，全乡就普及了小学教育。随着中等教育的发展，近两三年来，每年都有二百多农民子弟从初中或高中毕业，已经回乡参加农业生产的高中毕业生就有四十九名。在业余教育方面，到1957年末，全乡生产小组长以上的干部全部达到了高小以上文化程度，在95％的青壮年农民中扫除了文盲，有五百五十一人达到初中文化程度，有四十三人达到高中文化程度。
    随着生产的发展和人民物质生活的改善，他们不仅要求继续提高文化，而且迫切要求学习科学技术，更好地解决生产中出现的新的技术问题。特别是在1958年生产大跃进中，旧的生产指标被突破，新的更高的生产指标提出来了。要兴修水利，合理施肥，大搞深翻，全面贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，逐步实现农业机械化（已有四台拖拉机），群众感到没有科学技术不行了。这时，工农商学兵相结合的、政社合一的人民公社诞生了。人民公社的成立，给社办教育开辟了广阔的道路。
          公社办学校的四大优越性
    （一）公社规模大、范围广，便于调动一切积极力量，兴办教育事业。过去农业社规模小、力量弱，只能管生产不能管教育。公社成立后，组织规模大，力量强了，很快地就建立了两所农业中学，招收了三百一十五名学生。他们都是高级社时不能升入公办中学的十六岁以下的高小毕业生。公社统一筹划资金，发动群众，有人出人，有力出力，群众、学生齐动手，仅用一个多月时间，建成了可容纳三百五十名学生的校舍和一百人用的宿舍。还从公益金中，抽出15％作为业余教育基金，解决了经费问题。公社还调配和聘请了农业中学教师十五名，选拔了各级业余学校教师二百五十五名。业余大学聘请公社党委书记讲政治课，社长金时龙讲公社经营管理课，有八年水稻培育经验的学员吕根泽讲水稻培育技术课，请延边农学院的教师担任基础课，还请有丰富经验的老农做生产实习的指导。社员们说：“有了人民公社，办学校也是八仙过海，各显其能”。
      （二）人民公社兴办各种福利事业，便于发展业余教育。由于公社大办了公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园，使大多数妇女摆脱了繁琐的家务劳动，能够有更多的时间，参加业余学习。过去，东盛管理区的妇女只有30％参加业余学习，而且是“三天打鱼，两天晒网”。现在76％的妇女能够经常参加业余学习。公社成立后，又增办了业余小学六十七个班；业余初中四十二个班；业余高中十个班。这样，参加业余学习的人数比公社成立前增加了八百八十二人。十六名高中毕业生，因为过去是家庭主要劳动力，经济条件不充裕，不能到正规大学学习，现在可以在公社的业余农业大学，边生产、边学习了。
      （三）公社办学校，更便于教育与生产劳动相结合，脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合。公社的业余农业大学、业余中小学以及农业中学，主要是为了培养直接从事公社生产的新型农民。因此，根据公社生产需要安排了学习内容，“做什么，学什么”，实行了政治、文化、技术三结合。公社拨给农业中学、业余大学十四公顷水田、十八公顷旱田、三公顷果园、十头耕牛、三辆车，作为学生的生产基地。业余大学的学生还根据公社生产需要组成了农作物、植物保护、土壤与农业化学、园艺、农业机械、测量等六个研究小组。去年冬季深翻地和水利建设时，他们用学到的化学知识制造了五百吨土炸药。今年又根据当地农作物常发生的病虫害，研究和创造了三十五种土农药。还种了五亩优良品种水稻试验田，试验了十二种水稻品种。建立了一个水稻需水测量站，准备在两年内解决水稻需水量的测定工作，结合试验、研究，并写出四十多篇文章。例如学员们根据老农的经验，共同编写了“民间农药制作法”一书，正在征求老农意见，以便进一步修改和补充。学员吕根泽编写的“水稻栽培技术问答”一书，已由延边科学技术协会出版，很受读者欢迎。群众赞扬说：“公社办学校，教出来的学生，能说能做，文武双全”。
      （四）公社便于对生产和教育进行全面安排，统一领导，使教育服从生产，服务于生产的需要。人民公社既领导经济，又领导文化；既管生产，又管教育。公社党委加强了教育工作的统一领导，把教育工作纳入了党委的议事日程。党委在领导教育工作中，首先保证生产任务的完成，使学习紧密结合生产，为生产服务。在生产和学习的组织上，做到了二者统一。公社把分散在各管理区的业余大学生，集中起来，编为一个直属生产队。他们有了固定的耕畜、土地、果园及农具，并担负公社统一分配的生产任务。业余中、小学的班组，同时又是生产技术研究小组。在学习形式上，采用了灵活多样的方法。在生产和教育的时间安排上，坚决贯彻了“小忙多学，大忙少学，太忙不学”的原则。例如：在特忙的插秧期，各级业余学校就停止学习，突击完成插秧任务；在春耕、夏锄、秋收的紧张阶段，就用课堂学习与地头学习相结合的方法，每周只进行四、五小时学习；在冬季一般地都坚持了每周七、八小时学习；外出搞副业时，采取了领任务、带书本、跟教师，走到那里学到那里的方法。因此，全社虽然有两千五百四十三名青壮年农民参加了业余学习，但没有影响生产劳动，而且坚持了常年业余学习，做到了生产、学习两不误。两所农业中学，由于坚持了半工半读，已经实现了经济自给，减轻了公社和家长负担，并且学到了不少科学文化知识和生产知识。公社对各级各类学校实行了统一领导，分级管理：公社负责管理公办中、小学，农业中学和业余大学；管理区负责管理业余中学；生产队负责管理业余小学。公社党委还在东盛管理区，试办了一所由小学到高中的业余中心学校，以便取得经验，指导全面。
      教育事业发展　思想面貌改观
    一年来，由于人民公社带来了空前的有利条件，使全社各项教育事业有了显著的发展。现在，全社有公办全日制小学九所，初中一所；民办半日制农业中学两所（包括一个高中班）；业余教育有小学一百四十一个班，初中一百二十二个班，高中十二个班，业余农业大学一所。这样，这个公社，既有公办、又有民办；既有全日制、又有半日制和业余学校；既有普及、又有提高。正是由于两条腿走路，才多快好省地发展了教育事业。全社现有全日制和半日制学校学生四千六百零一人，比公社成立前增加了22％；业余学校学生二千九百四十人，比公社成立前增加了43％。全社三千二百三十八户中，参加各级各类学校学习的学生共有七千五百四十一人，平均每两户有三名小学生，每三户有两名中学生，每三十户有一名大学生。
    教育事业的全面发展，大大地改变了人们的思想面貌，进一步提高了社员的社会主义思想觉悟。特别是，农民们掌握了科学文化知识后，他们进一步相信科学，相信自己力量了。例如，过去一般用脚蹬打稻机脱粒，三人蹬一台，起早贪黑，累得腰酸腿痛，一天才打出四千斤稻子。有了文化以后就截然不同了。过去一个大字不识的金炳千，上了业余初中以后，用了一冬的时间，就试制成了一台畜力打稻机，效率提高一倍。群众科学技术水平提高了以后，保守思想大大减少了，接受新的事物更快了。公社在今年的农业生产中采用了一系列的新技术和先进经验。改革了旧的耕作法，实行了深翻；推广了油纸温床育苗法，提前了插秧期；推行了三乘六式、四角式和三角式的水稻密植。正是由于推广了这一系列的新技术，所以才战胜了困难，获得了空前的大丰收。今年全社粮食总产量可达两千三百十六万三千多斤，比大丰收的1958年又增长16％，创造了海兰江平原开发一百来年粮食产量的最高纪录。业余大学的生产搞得更好。学生们根据学到的技术，运用了玻璃温床育苗，提前二十天插秧；实行了单排单灌，提高了水温；防止了稻热病；进行合理施肥。因此，他们的庄稼是全社最好的。水稻每公顷平均可打一万三千斤，比全社平均产量多四千斤。社员们看到大学的水稻长得好，就三一帮、两一伙地到大学来，让大学生们介绍丰产经验。社员们在生产中遇到难题，就来找他们帮助解决。今年夏天龙山管理区青年卫星队的水稻高产田贪青、不抽穗，生产队长连着往大学跑了好几趟。业余大学的师生，针对这个问题进行了专题研究，并且提出了用“过磷酸钙根外追肥法”使水稻得到正常发育。他们不仅在生产上获得了丰收，而且在学习上也取得了很大成绩。今年8月末，业余大学用延边农学院的考试题目，作期末考试，结果在参加考试的四十六名学生中，七名优等，二十名良好，十八名及格，只有一名不及格，获得了群众好评。公社通过业余教育还培养出拖拉机手、农业、园艺、牧畜、渔业、林业等各方面的技术人材五百二十七名。他们已成为各项生产战线上的技术骨干。过去当饲养员的李万玉，从脱盲以后，开始学习兽医，经过几年的苦学苦钻，现在已是能治牛马羊鸡兔的兽医了。过去不识字，记工账画人画牛角的金时龙，现在不仅能用朝鲜文写工作总结报告，而且能看懂一般的汉文书报。八年前从初中毕业的吕根泽，经过几年来的业余学习和刻苦钻研，对水稻的育苗、灌水、施肥、密植，都摸到了一些经验，已成为水稻栽培专家。
    教育事业的发展也丰富了广大社员的文化生活。公社有业余文工团，各管理区有俱乐部，各队有业余演员，演出的歌舞，大部分都是自己编排的。此外，还有一百二十个读报组，社员们订有报纸和杂志一千四百八十一份；十四个图书室中藏有群众喜爱的书籍上万册；公社还设有一所有线广播站，有五百个喇叭，社员们可以常常听到国内外大事。文艺创作也很活跃，学员们写了很多民歌、散文、歌曲、剧本等作品。在“海兰江”“长白山”等杂志和延边日报上发表的就有二百多篇。这里的卫生面貌也有很大的改变。人民已经有了讲卫生、除疾病的习惯和常识。过去经常流行的斑疹伤寒已被根除了。随着文化生活的提高，体育活动也十分活跃。各管理区都有足、排球队，每到年节和休息的时候，经常举行小型体育比赛。比赛内容新鲜多样，有球类、田径，也有秋千、跳板、摔跤等民族形式。
    今后随着生产的迅速发展，公社教育事业将继续大踏步的前进。在今冬明春，要围绕党的中心任务，扫除少数剩余文盲，大力提高发展各级各类业余学校，掀起新的学习高潮。在朝鲜族学员中除了学习本民族语言外，还要学习汉族语文。现在看来，只要坚持下去，继续向前发展，社员个个成为有社会主义觉悟、有科学文化的新型农民，已不是遥远的事了。
