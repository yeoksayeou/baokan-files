Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 31st: According to reports in local newspapers today, the Secretariat of the Vietnam Workers' Party Central Committee issued a directive on the 28th, calling for a vigorous campaign of "patriotic competition."

The directive said that since the Second National Congress of Heroes and Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers and the implementation of socialist ideological education, the competition movement has been widely and deeply developed among workers, peasants, the army, and other strata of the people. After the launch of the competition movement, various departments have created many new records and made great achievements in all aspects of work, especially in socialist transformation and industrial and agricultural production. The current situation requires timely promotion of strengths, overcoming of shortcomings, promotion of the patriotic spirit of the people, the army, and cadres, vigorous development of the competition movement to complete the Three-Year Plan, vigorous promotion of socialist transformation and socialist construction in the North, and the struggle for the unification of the motherland.

The directive stipulates three titles to be awarded to individuals and units that have achieved good results in the competition: Advanced Laborer, Labor Model, and Labor Hero.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 1st: The "Chollima Work Team" movement, launched by Korean workers in the spring of this year, is developing more and more widely.

According to recent statistics from the Central Committee of the General Federation of Korean Trade Unions, 1,820 work teams from various industrial sectors in various regions of northern Korea have joined this new type of socialist competition movement, and 78 work teams have won the glorious title of "Chollima Work Team." This movement has played a huge role in improving production and the political and cultural level of workers.

First, the movement has greatly promoted the development of production. Various work teams participating in this movement and winning the title of "Chollima Work Team" have become banners for innovating production technology and promoting advanced technology in various factories and mines. The "Chollima Work Team" led by An Sang-jo, a steelmaking expert and labor hero at the Chengjin Steel Plant, recently creatively adopted new technologies such as multi-stage loading of raw materials and blowing in air, shortening the time for an electric furnace to make a furnace of steel from nine hours and five minutes in August to seven and a half hours at present.

The "Chollima Work Team" led by Qiu Mingfu of the Qingjin Artificial Fiber Factory improved production organization and launched a movement of five people watching four drawing machines. As a result, the speed of drawing artificial fiber increased from 75 meters per minute to 90 meters. They had already completed this year's plan ahead of schedule in June.

Various "Chollima Work Teams" have improved their collectivist thinking and strengthened unity and mutual assistance within and outside the team.

Now the "Chollima Work Team" movement in Korea is developing further and more widely. Not only factories, but also many stores, hospitals, and even faculty and staff in schools have participated in this movement. The 270 employees of the first spinning workshop of the Pyongyang Textile Factory recently held a meeting and passed a resolution, expressing their determination to create a "Chollima Workshop."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 1st: The Fifth Congress of the Free German Trade Union Federation, which opened on October 26, closed at noon on October 31. After heated discussions, the congress unanimously adopted the "Main Tasks of Trade Unions in the Struggle for Socialist Victory and Safeguarding Peace in the German Democratic Republic" resolution and took it as the union's program of action for the future.

During the discussion at the conference, representatives pointed out that developing collective labor is an important task in building socialism in the German Democratic Republic at present.

Wanke made a concluding speech at the conference. He pointed out that the conference fully demonstrated the unity of the working class and the trade union in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

Wanke pointed out that the representatives' speeches in the discussion showed that collective labor is not limited to production, but has already developed between workers and scientists, workers and artists, workers and doctors, and workers and educators. He said that the task of the trade union is to promote this collective labor.

Wanke announced that there are already 44,700 production teams (including 528,000 workers) participating in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team," and the number of "Socialist Research and Labor Collectives" has increased to 21,900, with a total of 184,000 people.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest: The advanced production group movement for striving to work and live in a socialist way is being widely carried out in various factories and enterprises in Romania.

In these production groups, the collectivist spirit of "one for all, all for one" has begun to be established. Every member of the group is determined to become a model and innovator in production and a good comrade in life. They care about each other's work and help each other in order to achieve common improvement in all aspects of political, professional, and cultural levels. In their spare time, everyone works hard to study and lives a rich and colorful life.

The "August 23" production group of the "Red Star" factory in Bucharest is such a production group. The eight comrades in the group work and live together intimately. But the shortcomings of the comrades in the group are never tolerated. They once helped a young worker in the group correct the shortcomings of throwing tools around and wasting time, and helped him improve from a fourth-grade worker to a fifth-grade worker. The members of the "August 23" production group have jointly completed the basic technical course, and are now studying engineering drawings together. They all strive to be able to understand the most complex design drawings without consulting engineers or technicians.

In this group, the slogan "Everyone becomes an advanced producer" has been realized, and now they have put forward a new slogan "Everyone becomes an innovator." So far, they have put forward ten innovation suggestions, seven of which have been adopted, saving the country 10,000 lei (Romanian currency).

In their spare time, they actively participate in social activities or study politics and culture. Sometimes they also take their wives and children to see movies, dramas, or go out for outings to enrich family life and establish close relationships between families.

    树立先进旗手　创造生产奇迹
    越南劳动党中央号召大力开展爱国竞赛
    朝鲜千里马作业班运动大大促进生产发展
    德意志民主共和国工会决定发展集体劳动
    罗马尼亚广大职工团结互助学先进争先进
    新华社河内31日电　据此间报纸今天报道：越南劳动党中央书记处在28日发出指示，号召大力开展“爱国竞赛运动”。
    指示说，自从举行第二次全国工农兵英雄劳动模范联欢大会和开展社会主义思想教育以后，竞赛运动在工人、农民、军队和其他各阶层人民中已经有了广泛深入的发展。开展竞赛运动以后，各部门创造了许多新的纪录，并且在各方面的工作中，特别是在社会主义改造工作中，在工农业生产中，做出了很大的成绩。目前的情况要求及时发扬优点，克服缺点，发扬人民、军队和干部的爱国精神，大力开展完成三年计划的竞赛运动，大力推动北方社会主义改造和社会主义建设，并且进行统一祖国的斗争。
    指示规定了授给在竞赛中取得良好成绩的个人和单位的三种称号：先进劳动者、劳动模范和劳动英雄。
    据新华社平壤1日电　朝鲜工人自今年春天展开的“千里马作业班”运动日益广泛地发展。
    据朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会最近统计，已有包括朝鲜北部各个地区各个工业部门的一千八百二十个作业班涌入了这个新型的社会主义竞赛运动，并且有七十八个作业班荣获了“千里马作业班”的光荣称号。这个运动对于提高生产和工人的政治、文化水平都起了巨大的作用。
    首先，运动大大推动了生产的发展。参加这个运动和荣获“千里马作业班”称号的各个作业班，都成为各个厂矿企业革新生产技术和推广先进技术的旗手。城津炼钢厂炼钢能手、劳动英雄安相兆领导的“千里马作业班”最近创造性地采用了多阶段装入原料、吹入空气等新的技术，把电炉炼一炉钢的时间由今年8月的九小时零五分缩短到目前的七小时半。
    清津人造纤维厂秋明福领导的“千里马作业班”改进了生产组织，开展了五人看四台抽纱机的运动。结果，抽人造纤维的速度由每分钟七十五米提高到九十米。他们早在6月份就已提前完成了今年的计划。
    各个“千里马作业班”都提高了集体主义的思想，在班内和班外加强了团结互助。
    现在朝鲜的“千里马作业班”运动正进一步广泛发展。不仅工厂，许多商店、医院，甚至学校里的教职员都参加了这个运动。平壤纺织工厂第一纺纱车间的二百七十名职工最近集会通过决议，表示要创造“千里马车间”。
    据新华社柏林1日电　10月26日开幕的自由德国工会联合会第五次代表大会在10月31日中午闭幕。大会经过热烈讨论后，一致通过“工会在争取德意志民主共和国社会主义胜利以及维护和平的斗争中的主要任务”的决议，并把它作为工会今后的工作纲领。
    在大会讨论过程中，代表们指出，发展集体劳动是当前在德意志民主共和国建设社会主义的重要任务。
    瓦恩克在大会作了总结发言。他指出：这次代表大会充分显示了工人阶级和工会在争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中的团结一致。
    瓦恩克指出，代表们在讨论中的发言表明，集体劳动不只限于生产上，而且已经在工人和科学家之间、工人和艺术家之间、工人和医生之间以及工人和教育家之间发展起来。他说，工会的任务就是促进这种集体劳动。
    瓦恩克宣布，目前已经有四万四千七百个生产队（包括五十二万八千名工人）参加了争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛，“社会主义研究和劳动集体”已增加到二万一千九百个，人数达到十八万四千人。
    据新华社布加勒斯特电　争取按社会主义方式劳动和生活的先进生产组运动正在罗马尼亚各工厂企业中广泛展开。
    在这些生产组中，“一人为大家，大家为一人”的集体主义精神已经开始建立起来。每一个组员都决心成为生产中的模范和革新者，生活中的好同志。他们彼此关心工作，互相帮助，以求得在政治、业务和文化水平各方面的共同提高。工余时，大家都努力学习，过着丰富多采的生活。
    布加勒斯特“红星”工厂的“八·二三”生产组就是这样的一个生产组。组里八个同志亲密无间地一起工作、生活。但是对组内同志的缺点决不容忍。他们曾经帮助组内一个青年工人改正了乱扔工具、浪费时间的缺点，并帮助他从四级工提高到五级工。“八·二三”生产组的组员们共同学完了基本技术课，现在又一起学习工程图，他们都争取在不用请教工程师或技师的情况下，能看懂最复杂的设计图纸。
    在这个组里，“大家都成为先进生产者”的口号已经实现，现在他们又提出“大家都成为革新者”这一新口号。到目前为止，他们已提出了十项革新建议，有七项已被采用，为国家节约了一万列伊（罗币）。
    工余，他们都积极参加社会活动或学习政治、文化。他们有时也一道带着妻儿看看电影、戏剧或出外郊游，以丰富家庭生活和建立家庭间的亲密往来。
