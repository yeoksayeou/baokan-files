The Personnel Department of the Northeast Railway Bureau is trialing the piece-rate wage system in car inspection, shunting, conductor and other positions. The first stage—specifically researching the manpower, material resources, and time required for each piece of work—has achieved preliminary results thanks to the help of Soviet experts. The trial implementation of the piece-rate wage system in car inspection began in early September. Prior to this, each bureau selected a total of 24 cadres to study at the General Bureau, where Soviet experts gave lectures and a technical standard verification table was created. After the training, the work was divided into two parts: one part formed the car inspection piece-rate research group, which trialed the system in Harbin; the other part returned to each bureau to study and trial the system. The work of the Harbin research group proceeded smoothly. During the nearly one month of "workday recording" from early September to early October, the average time for a Class A inspection of a vehicle was reduced from 41 hours and 40 minutes to 26 hours. It was discovered that there were many unreasonable and unscientific aspects in material requisition, labor organization, work system, and production management, resulting in serious waste of manpower and financial resources. For example, the material requisition procedures were cumbersome, and the foreman lacked planning when requisitioning materials. Instead of studying the required materials clearly and requisitioning them once or twice before repairing the vehicle, they requisitioned them as they went along, often requiring seven or eight material requisitions in a single Class A inspection, taking up 120 to 130 minutes. After the research group proposed improvements, work efficiency has been greatly improved. If all the saved work hours were used for car inspection, more than 30 additional Class A inspections could be completed each month.

In shunting, the trial was conducted in Qiqihar. It was first discovered that the station was overstaffed in each shunting group with an extra shunting chief and an inspector in the pursuit of stability, with six groups having twelve extra people in total; in addition, the shunting speed did not meet the standards. Other time-wasting phenomena, such as inconsistent shift changes between locomotive shunting personnel and shunting personnel, and poor communication between car number clerks and cargo departments, were also found. After reasonable scheduling, it is estimated that 254 work hours can be saved each month.

The writing process for the trial implementation of the piece-rate wage system for conductors has not yet been summarized, but existing materials also reveal many wasteful phenomena. For example, the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot rotates all 26 locomotives in the depot (only 17 are actually needed) in order to ensure that each locomotive reaches a safe mileage, preventing each person from reaching the standard working hours and wasting both locomotives and manpower. Other wasteful phenomena, such as conductors making futile trips due to poor scheduling, and delays caused by the preparation of conductors before the train is assembled, are also common.

The piece-rate contracting system for locomotive maintenance has been implemented for a longer period and has achieved many successes. In the past, each contracting group had 32 people, and based on an eight-hour workday, it took seven to eight days to repair (Class A inspection) one locomotive, completing approximately 48 locomotives per year. After implementing the piece-rate contracting system, the labor organization was changed to 26 people per group, and the same locomotive could be repaired in only four to five days. Based on this standard, 72 locomotives can be repaired each year.

　　东北铁路检车乘务等方面　
    试行计件工资制　
    初步克服浪费提高效率
    【本报讯】东北铁路总局人事部在检车、调车、乘务等方面试行计件工资的第一阶段—即具体研究每件工所需要的人力、物力及时间，由于苏联专家的帮助，已获得初步成绩。检车方面试行计件工资起始于九月上旬，事先由各局抽调干部共二十四人到总局学习，由苏联专家讲课，并作出了技术标准查定法则表。学习终了分两部分进行工作：一部分组成检车计件研究组，在哈尔滨试行；另一部分回各局研究试行。哈尔滨研究小组工作进行较顺利，从九月初到十月初将近一个月的“工作日写实”工作中，使过去平均甲检一辆车实用四十一小时四十分钟的时间，减少到二十六个小时；发现了过去在材料领取上、劳动组织上、工作制度上、生产管理上都存在许多不合理不科学之处，严重浪费人力、财力。譬如领材料手续麻烦，工长领材料时又缺乏计划，不是在修车前把所需要的材料研究清楚一次或两次领取，而是随用随领，这样常在一个甲检中领七、八次材料，占用一百二、三十分钟。经过研究组提出改进后，工作效率已大为提高，如把节省下来的工时全用于检车上，每月可增加甲检车三十多台。
    调车方面，在齐齐哈尔试行。首先发现该站为了过分求稳，每一调车组多配备了一个调车长，一个检查员，六个组共多余十二人；另外在调车速度上未达到标准，其他如机车捣站人员与调车人员换班不一致，车号员与货物方面联系不好等诸多浪费时间现象，经合理调度后，预计每月可节省二百五十四个工时。
    乘务方面试行计件工资写实过程现在尚未总结，但根据现有材料也发现存在不少浪费现象。如苏家屯机务段为了使每台机车达到安全走行公里，全段二十六台机车轮流出乘（实际用十七台即可），使每人不能达到标准劳动时间，机车、人力都造成浪费。其他如因调度计划不周密，使乘务员徒劳往返，乘务已准备好而车未编好，以致耽误时间的浪费现象也不少。
    机务推行的计件包修制时间较长，收到了不少成绩。过去每个包修组三十二人，每日以八小时工作计算，修（甲检）一台机车需七至八天，每年可完成四十八台左右。经实行计件包修制后，改变了劳动组织，每小组二十六人，同样修一台车只需四至五天就够了，依照这个标准，每年可修七十二台。
