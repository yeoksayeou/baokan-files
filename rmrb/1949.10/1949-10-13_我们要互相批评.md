　　We Should Criticize Each Other
    Zheng Zhiqiang, Worker at Chaoyangmen Railway Station
    Standing on the position of serving the people, we should conduct frank and sincere criticism of the shortcomings and errors of other comrades. We should also constantly examine our own shortcomings and errors and conduct self-criticism. Some comrades easily see the mistakes of others, but find it difficult to see their own shortcomings. Some comrades only know how to criticize others and not themselves. There are also comrades who never dare to criticize others, fearing to "offend" people. Still other comrades only like people to mention their good points and advantages, and ignore others mentioning their own shortcomings. If they hear others criticizing themselves, they become very unhappy. By promoting the spirit of mutual criticism and self-criticism, developing our strengths, and overcoming our weaknesses, we can make progress. Therefore, we must carry out mutual criticism and self-criticism, and always discover our own shortcomings and errors. If we often criticize each other, will it create disunity? If we quarrel over trivial matters, it will naturally undermine our unity. If everyone's purpose is to strive for progress, to recognize the truth, then the more mutual criticism we carry out, the more our unity will be strengthened. Sometimes, if you see my shortcomings, you should see them as your own, and sincerely point them out, and propose ways to correct them, and I will treat you the same way. In this situation, we will definitely be very united. If we encounter political issues or ideological issues, and my views disagree with yours, and I don't accept your criticism, then can we avoid disputes? We cannot. On the contrary, such disputes are very beneficial, because the result of the dispute will reveal what is wrong and what is the truth. We must also understand that we should not ignore or disregard a person with shortcomings or errors. That is wrong. We should carefully point out their shortcomings so that they can admit them and correct them. With this attitude, we can naturally carry out criticism and self-criticism.

　　我们要互相批评
    朝阳门火车站工人  郑志强
    站在为人民服务的立场上，我们应该对于旁的同志的缺点与错误坦白、诚恳地进行批评，还要时时刻刻检查自己的缺点与错误，进行自我批评。有的同志容易看见别人的错误，可是很难看见自己的缺点，有的同志只知批评别人，不批评自己，也有的同志从来不顾批评别人，惟恐“得罪”人，还有的同志，只乐意人家提到他的好处和优点，不顾别人提他自己的缺点，如果听到别人批评自己，就十分的不高兴。发扬互相批评和自我批评的精神，由此发挥我们的长处，克服我们的短处，才能有进步，因此要进行互相批评和自我批评，随时发觉自己的缺点和错误，如果我们常常的互相批评，会不会造成不团结的现象呢？如果因为一点小事情争吵，那自然要破坏我们的团结，如果大家的目的都是为了争取进行，为了认清真理，那么互相批评愈多进行，就愈能使我们的团结加强，有时你看到了我的缺点，就应象看到你自己的缺点一样，应该诚恳的指出来，并且提出怎样改正的办法，而我也同样的对待你，在这种情形下，我们一定会团结得很好，如果遇到了政治问题，或思想问题，我的看法，你不同意，你的批评我不接受，那么我们能不能不发生争论呢？是不能的，相反地，这种争论十分有益，因为争论的结果，就能判别出来什么是错误，什么是真理。我们还要懂得，对于一个有缺点、有错误的人，并不是就应当看也不看，理也不理他，这是不对的，应当好好地指出其缺点，使其承认自己的缺点，能改正自己的缺点、错误。有了这种态度，自然能进行批评与自我批评了。
