Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: The Shanxi Provincial Production and Sales Conference was held last month. The central topic of discussion at the conference was how to connect urban-rural and inter-regional trade in the province, so that industrial and agricultural products could be exchanged, and industrial and agricultural production could support and develop each other. Finally, based on the province's autumn and winter production plan, the conference formulated a plan for material exchange between urban and rural areas and between the province and other regions. The main contents of the plan are: Seizing the current season when agricultural and sideline products are on the market, vigorously purchasing and promoting agricultural products, including grain, industrial raw materials, and export goods. Simultaneously promote industrial products while purchasing and promoting agricultural products, to supply farmers' needs and strengthen urban-rural mutual assistance and unity. In terms of purchasing agricultural products, raw materials, and export goods, this includes: Purchasing and promoting cotton produced in southern Shanxi to ensure the supply of raw materials for the province's domestic and foreign textile industries; Purchasing grain and oilseeds (hemp seeds, sesame, peanuts) not only to supply the province but also to strive for export to support neighboring regions and large cities; Purchasing 20 million eggs and 25,000 catties of pig bristles for export through Tianjin; Opening up sales channels for mountain products and medicinal materials; and organizing the export of 140 million catties of Yuncheng Lu salt and large amounts of coal and iron produced in Shanxi annually. The plan also includes: Promoting pumps, waterwheels, sprayers, fertilizer powder, and other products manufactured by the province's industries, and importing foreign cloth, native cloth, kerosene, paints, sugar, tea, etc., to supply the countryside. To complete the above plan, the production and sales conference decided: 1. Strengthen state-owned commerce and vigorously organize supply and marketing cooperatives. State-owned specialized companies should cooperate closely with cooperatives to complete the promotion plan. 2. Encourage legitimate private merchants to go to the countryside for purchasing, and provide necessary convenience. All regions should implement the policy of free domestic trade, and any unapproved restrictions on purchasing and transportation must be seriously corrected. 3. Repair roads and reduce freight rates. 4. Establish organizations such as farmer service centers and exchanges in major cities. 5. Organize economic visit groups to Tianjin, Shanghai, the Northeast, and the Northwest for investigation, and sign trade contracts with various regions. 6. Establish and improve financial and economic committees at all levels to unify steps and complete tasks; and correctly grasp the price policy to avoid the phenomenon of low grain prices hurting farmers. At the meeting, Pei Lisheng, the vice chairman of the provincial government, also announced that the provincial government had decided to issue 1.8 billion yuan in winter production loans to develop the province's export specialties, marketable handicrafts, and rural sideline production.
  Shanxi is famous throughout the country for its rich special products such as coal and iron, and grain production had a surplus before the war, which was transported and sold to western Hebei, northern Henan, and other places. However, because urban-rural and inter-regional material exchanges have not been fully restored, before this provincial production and sales conference, some areas had to suspend operations or reduce production due to the inability to sell products, while other areas deeply felt the lack of raw materials or commodities. For example, many small iron factories in Yangquan have recently suspended operations and reduced production due to the sluggish sales of iron products, while the Zhengtai Coal and Iron Branch Company in Taiyuan deeply feels that the supply of iron products cannot meet the demand. This conference made a comprehensive preliminary understanding of the production and sales situation of the province's special products, and only based on this understanding, formulated a plan to restore and develop the province's urban-rural and inter-regional material exchanges. During the conference discussions, there was also a further and deeper understanding of ideas such as urban-rural mutual assistance and the worker-peasant alliance.

　　山西产销会议订定方案
  　沟通城乡物资
  　加强区外贸易
    大力收购农产品并推销工业品
    省府决定冬季生产贷款十八亿，发展出口特产品。
    【新华社北京十五日电】太原讯：山西全省产销会议已于上月召开。会议讨论的中心是如何沟通该省的城乡和区外贸易，使工、农业产品得以互相交流，工、农生产得以互相支援和互相发展。最后，会议根据该省秋冬生产计划，制订了一个全省城乡和区外物资交流的方案。方案主要内容为：抓紧目前农产及副产品上市的季节，大力收购和推销农产品，包括粮食、工业原料和出口物资。在收购和推销农产品中同时推销工业产品，供给农民需要，以加强城乡互相和团结。在收购农产品、原料、出口物资方面，包括：收购推销晋南所产棉花，保证省对内外纺织工业的原料供给；收购粮食和油料（大小麻籽、芝麻、花生）除供应本省外，并争取输出以支援友邻区和大城市；收购鸡蛋两千万个、猪鬃二万五千斤运天津出口；为山货药材等打开销路；和组织年产一亿四千万斤的运城潞盐和山西所产的大量煤铁输出等。方案另一方面包括：推销本省工业所制造的抽水机、水车、喷雾器、肥田粉等，和输入洋布、土布、煤油、颜料、糖、茶等以供应农村。为完成上述方案，产销会议决定：一、加强国营商业，大力组织供销合作社。各国营专业公司应与合作社密切配合以完成推销计划。二、鼓励正当私商下乡收购，给予必要方便。各地应贯彻内地贸易自由政策，未经批准的限购限运现象必须认真纠正。三、修复道路，减低运费。四、主要城市设农民服务和交易所等组织。五、组织经济参观团赴天津、上海、东北、西北考察，并与各地订立贸易合同。六、建立并健全各级财经委员会，以统一步骤，完成任务；并正确掌握物价政策以避免谷贱伤农现象。会上，该省省府副主席裴丽生并宣布省府决定发放冬季生产贷款十八亿元，以发展该省出口特产，有销路的手工业和农村副业的生产。
    按山西煤铁等特产丰富，全国著名，产粮在战前亦向有剩余，运销冀西、豫北等地。但由于城乡和区外物资交流未完全恢复，在此次全省产销会议以前，有些地区因产品推销不出而停业或减产，而另一些地区又深感原料或商品缺乏。如阳泉许多小型铁工厂最近即因铁货滞销停业减产，太原的正太煤铁分公司却深感铁货供不应求。此次会议对该省特产产销情况作了全面的初步了解，才根据这一了解，制订了一个恢复和发展该省城乡和区外物资交流的方案。会议讨论中，对城乡互助、工农联盟等思想也有了进一步的深刻的体会。
