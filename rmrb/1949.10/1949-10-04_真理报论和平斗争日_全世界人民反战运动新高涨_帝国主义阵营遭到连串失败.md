Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd - TASS Moscow, 2nd: Today is International Peace Day, a major event of great international significance. Pravda, Izvestia, Red Star, and Labor Daily all published editorials and prominently featured numerous dispatches from across the country, describing the firm determination of Soviet working people, expressed in mass rallies in various locations, to fight for peace and oppose new war instigators.

Pravda's editorial, titled "The Cause of Peace is a Just Cause, It Will Triumph!" stated: International Peace Day marks a new and powerful upsurge in the worldwide people's anti-war movement. On this day, all progressive men and women around the world are watching Moscow, watching the Soviet Union and the great Stalin, whose name has become the battle flag for the fight for lasting peace and friendship between nations. Pravda emphasized: The Chinese people have declared the establishment of the People's Republic of China, a historic victory of immense importance for the cause of fighting for peace and opposing warmongers. The victory won by the Chinese people has dealt the heaviest blow to the imperialists' aggressive designs in the Pacific. The imperialist camp is suffering one failure after another. The balance of power on the world stage continues to shift, in favor of the peace and democracy camp. The people of all countries have not forgotten how the warmongers brandished the atomic bomb, claiming to have a monopoly on atomic weapons. This is what formed the basis of atomic diplomacy - a diplomacy of blackmail, intimidation, and command. It frightens the timid, but it cannot frighten the fighters for peace. Today, the advocates of the atomic policy have gone bankrupt in front of the whole world. Many commentaries on the TASS statement make it clear that the imperialist camp is dominated by chaos. Pravda went on to say that the current peace movement has nothing in common with the bourgeois passive negation of war, pacifism. This is a powerful movement of people who have accumulated political experience in years of serious tests and the pain of war, who are unwilling to repeat the horrors of war, and who are prepared to valiantly and resolutely defend the right to life, peace, and security. Pravda said: The imperialist conspiracies require us to tirelessly strengthen our vigilance, continue to develop the peace movement and attract broader sections of all nations into this movement, and to more actively expose the conspiracies and plans of the warmongers.

　　真理报论和平斗争日
    全世界人民反战运动新高涨帝国主义阵营遭到连串失败
    【新华社北京三日电】据塔斯社莫斯科二日讯：今天是国际和平日，这是具有极大国际重要性的大事件。真理报、消息报、红星和劳动报均发表社论，并以显著地位刊登全国各地的许多电讯，描述苏联劳动人民在各地群众大会中所表示的争取和平，反对新战争挑拨者的坚强决心。
    真理报的以“和平事业是正义的事业，它将赢得胜利！”为题的社论说：国际和平日标志着全世界人民反战运动新的强有力的高涨。这一天，全世界一切进步男女都注视着莫斯科，注视着苏联和伟大的斯大林，他的名字已经成为争取持久和平与各国友谊的战斗的旗帜。真理报着重指出：中国人民已经宣告成立中华人民共和国，这个历史性的胜利对于争取和平、反对战争贩子的事业有着巨大重要性。中国人民所获的胜利，对帝国主义者在太平洋上的侵略图谋，给予了最沉重的打击。帝国主义阵营遭受到一个接着一个的失败。世界舞台上的力量对比继续改变着，而有利于和平民主阵营。各国人民并没有忘记战争贩子曾如何挥舞着原子弹，把他们自己说成是独占了原子武器。就是这一点，形成了原子外交——讹诈、恫赫和命令的外交的基础。它吓住了胆怯者，但是却吓唬不住和平斗士。今天，原子政策的鼓吹者已在全世界面前破产了。对塔斯社声明的许多评论，都明白地说到帝国主义阵营已为混乱所支配。真理报接着说，现在的和平运动和资产阶级消极否定战争的和平主义丝毫没有共同的地方。这是在多年严重考验与战争痛苦中积累了政治经验的人民，不愿意重复战争恐怖，准备英勇果敢地保卫生活权利、和平与安全的强有力的运动。真理报说：帝国主义的阴谋要求我们不倦地加强警惕，继续发展和平运动并把各民族更广大的阶层吸引到这一运动中来，并且要更积极地揭发战争贩子的阴谋计划。
