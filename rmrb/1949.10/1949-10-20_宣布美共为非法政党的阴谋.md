The United States Federal Court jury, acting according to the will of Wall Street, shamelessly "sentenced" eleven members of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States to ten years in prison and a fine of $10,000 (the maximum) on the 14th. As these Communist leaders stated in their statement on the 15th, this "sentence" is not only an attack on the 70,000 members of the American Communist Party, but also a direct attack on the basic freedoms of the American working people. This trial has been going on for more than a year. Its "basis" is the Smith Act passed by the US Congress in 1940, which states that "anyone who intends to incite the overthrow of the US government by force" shall be sentenced to ten years in prison and a fine of $100,000. In August 1948, twelve leaders of the American Communist Party were suddenly arrested. In February of the same year, the US Attorney General admitted that there was no evidence to prove that this thirty-year-old party intended to overthrow the government by force. But the bourgeoisie can fabricate charges with all kinds of shameless slanders. At the beginning of this case, it aroused serious protests from just people all over the world, who unanimously believed that its impact was not limited to the American people, but that it was a signal that the United States was moving towards further fascism, and that it was evidence of Wall Street's conspiracy to create a new war. The following is a commentary by William Z. Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, published in the Communist Party's newspaper "The Daily Worker" after his arrest last year.

　　The sudden arrest of twelve of our leaders shows that the reactionaries are trying to declare our party illegal. The purpose of the reactionaries in holding this large-scale arrest is to distort the constitution, drive our party underground, and create a basis for them to further persecute our party through legal procedures. We must fully understand this so as to expose this slanderous conspiracy to the masses of the people and make them vigilant and realize that declaring the Communist Party illegal endangers their freedom.

　　Hidden behind this attack are several interrelated motives. First, the Truman government needs a smokescreen to confuse the people's vision so that he can be re-elected. The Republican Party is also painstakingly creating "spy terror" to undermine the Moscow negotiations and divert the people's attention from rising prices. The Democratic Party is also trying to do the same. This is the insidious meaning of this matter.

　　President Truman is extremely willing to send innocent people to prison in order to greedily hold onto power, even at the expense of abandoning the Bill of Rights. Can we expect him to do anything good for a president who has suppressed four national strikes, is responsible for passing the Taft-Hartley Act, and has caused prices to rise?

　　The second and more important reason why the reactionaries are trying to declare our party illegal is that they want to stifle our loud and powerful voice. They know very well that the Communist Party is the strongest fighter against American imperialism's preparation for war and in defense of the people's living standards and civil liberties. Therefore, they want to deprive the people of the leadership of the Communist Party, destroy our party, and drive it underground.

　　But the most decisive reason is that they know that if they want to establish fascism, they must first make the Communist Party an illegal party. This is exactly the same reason why Hitler declared the German Communist Party illegal.

　　Like the German reactionaries under Hitler, the American reactionaries know very well that if they want to succeed in attacking the people's democratic rights and democratic groups, they must first destroy the Communist Party. After declaring our party illegal, they will be able to, and will, more effectively attack every people's organization and mass movement, designating them as underground traitorous organizations and activities. The attack on the Communist Party is a new sign of the road to fascism, which has now appeared in the United States.

　　Therefore, defending the arrested communists must be carried out not only in the courtroom, but also in the broad forum of public opinion. We must expose the reasons for Truman's conspiracy to persecute our party; we must expose the Republican Party's fabricated spy terror; we must refute the rumors and slanders against the defendants. But more importantly, we must make the working class understand the important significance of this case; declaring the Communist Party illegal will be an extremely serious damage to the workers' movement, civil liberties, and the people's living standards.

　　Everything depends on how we make the workers and the people understand the significance of this event. Trying to make the Communist Party an illegal party is a huge blow to the organizations of workers and the people, as well as to their lives.

　　The capitalist reactionaries attach great importance to this matter, as can be proven by their continuous efforts to achieve this goal in the past. Only a year ago, they began their first direct attempt, when former Labor Secretary Schwellenbach requested Congress to declare our party illegal. However, this blatant proposal immediately aroused widespread opposition from trade union organizations, liberals, and the American people. The masses were correctly vigilant, and Schwellenbach's reactionary proposal was fascism. Therefore, he had to hastily withdraw the original motion.

　　Soon after, the shameless Mundt-Nixon Bill was proposed, which attempted to make the United States a police state. The drafters of this bill learned a sad lesson from Schwellenbach and the House Un-American Activities Committee, so they tried to hide the fact that their bill was aimed at declaring the Communist Party illegal. They lied that the purpose of this bill was only to "manage" the Communist Party and make it "public." They almost got Congress to pass this bill. But the people soon found out. A broad united front: the American Federation of Labor, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the Progressive Party, the Civil Liberties Union, the Communist Party, and other groups, united to oppose and expose the conspiracy of this bill to make our party illegal. The masses correctly understood that declaring our party illegal was a big step towards fascism.

　　Now their effort is to arrest and defame our party leaders. It is more cunning and dangerous than the previous two times. This time, in addition to the stale old tune of "attempting to overthrow the government by violence," they have added fabricated, fear-inducing charges of espionage. The purpose is to carry out the scheme of declaring illegality in the courts, hiding it under the guise of judicial procedures. They hope to accomplish in the courts what Schwellenbach and the Mundt-Nixon proposals could not accomplish in Congress.

　　The American people do not want the Communist Party to be declared illegal. This is not because a majority of the American people agree with its political program, but because the masses realize that declaring our party illegal will endanger the American—little bit of democracy that remains. We must fully understand the significance of this event and appeal to the people with various political views.

　　宣布美共为非法政党的阴谋
    美国共产党全国委员会主席  福斯特
    以华尔街的意旨为意旨的美国联邦法院陪审团，于十四日无耻地“判决”美国共产党全国委员会委员十一人以十年徒刑及一万元罚金（最高限度）。正如这几位共党领袖在十五日发表的声明中所说的，这个“判决”不仅是对美国七万共产党党员的攻击，也是对美国劳动人民的基本自由的直接进攻。这件审讯案已经进行了一年多。他的“根据”是一九四○年美国国会所通过的史密斯法案，该法案载，“意图教唆以武力倾覆美国政府者”判处十年徒刑，及十万元罚金。一九四八年八月，十二个美共领袖突遭逮捕。同年的二月间，美国联邦检察长还承认过，并没有证据足以证明这个具有三十年历史的政党企图以武力倾覆政府。但资产阶级是可以用各种无耻的诬蔑来捏造罪状的。这件案子一开始的时候，就引起全世界正义人民的严重抗议，一致认为它的影响不仅限于美国人民，它是美国走向更进一步的法西斯化的信号，它是华尔街阴谋制造新战争的证据。下面所译的是美共全国委员会主席威廉·Ｚ·福斯特于去年被捕后发表在美共机关报“工人日报”上的一篇评论。　　
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——译者
    我们十二个领袖突遭逮捕，表明了反动派试图宣布我党为非法。反动派举行这一大逮捕的目的是妄想曲解宪法，将我党驱入地下，制造根据，使他们能够用法律程序来更进一步地迫害我党。我们必须充分了解这一点，以便向人民大众揭穿这一诬陷阴谋，使他们警觉起来，认识宣布共产党为非法是危害他们的自由的。
    隐藏在这次攻击的幕后的，有几种互有关联的动机。首先，杜鲁门政府需要一个障眼的幌子来混乱人民的视线，使他能够重新当选。共和党也处心积虑地制造“间谍恐怖”来破坏莫斯科的谈判，转移人民的目标，不去注意高涨的物价。民主党也是这样企图着。这就是这件事的阴险的含意。
    杜鲁门总统为了贪恋权力是极愿意把无罪的人民送进监狱的，哪怕毁弃人权法案也在所不惜。我们对于一个镇压过四次全国性的罢工，负责通过塔孚脱——哈特莱法案，并造成物价高涨的总统，还能想望他做什么好事吗？
    反动派试图宣布我党为非法的第二个更重要的理由是他们想窒息我们的响亮有力的声音。他们知道得很清楚，共产党是反对美国帝国主义进行备战，保卫人民生活标准和民权自由的最坚强的战士。因此，他们想使人民失掉共产党的领导，破坏我党，将它驱入地下。
    但是最决定性的理由是，他们知道如果要建立法西斯主义，首先就必须使共产党成为非法政党。这是和从前希特勒宣布德国共产党为非法的理由完全相同的。
    美国反动派和希特勒的德国反动派一样，他们知道得很清楚，如果他们要在打击人民的民主权利和民主团体方面获得成功，就必须先破坏共产党。在把我党宣布为非法以后，他们才能够，也将要更有效地进攻每一个人民团体和群众运动，将它们指为地下的叛国者的组织和活动。向共产党进攻是走向法西斯主义的新的征象，法西斯主义现在已经在美国出现了。
    因此，为被捕的共产党人辩护，不仅要在法庭中进行，而且要在广大的民意的论坛上进行。我们必须暴露杜鲁门的迫害我党的阴谋的理由；我们必须揭穿共和党的伪造的间谍恐怖；我们必须驳斥那些对被告的造谣诬蔑。但更重要的，我们必须使工人阶级明了这个案件的重要意义；宣布共产党为非法，将是对工人运动，对民权自由，对人民生活标准的万分严重的损害。
    一切都依靠我们怎样去使工人和人民了解这个事件的意义，试图使共产党变成非法政党是对工人和人民的组织以及他们的生活的巨大打击。
    资本主义反动派把这件事情看得非常重要，这是可以把他们历次向这一目标的所采取的不断的努力，来做证明的。仅在一年之前，他们就开始了第一次直接的企图，那时前劳工部长施威伦巴提请国会宣布我党为非法。可是这一露骨的建议立即引起了职工组织、自由主义者、以及美国人民的普遍的反对。群众正确地警觉了，施威伦巴的反动建议就是法西斯主义。因此他不得不慌忙撤还原议。
    于是不久以后，又提出了无耻孟特——尼克逊法案，其企图是使美国成为一个警察国家。这一法案的起草人、从施威伦巴和非美活动调查委员会学习到了可悲的经验，所以他们设法隐瞒这一事实，那就是他们的法案的目的是宣布共产党为非法。他们撒谎道，这个法案的用意仅在“管理”共产党，使他“公开”出来。他们几乎使国会通过这个法栗。可是人民马上发觉了。一个广泛的联合阵线：美国劳工协会、产业职工大会，进步党，民权自由联合会，共产党，及其他团体等，一致起来反对，揭穿这个法栗的阴谋是要使我党成为非法。群众正确的理解了，宣布我党为非法，是向法西斯主义跨了一大步。
    现在他们的努力是逮捕并诽谤我党领袖。比过去两次更为狡黠和危险。这一次除了陈腐不堪的“企图以暴力倾覆政府”的老调之外，更加上捏造的，引起人民恐怖的，指我们为间谍的罪状。目的是想把宣布非法的计谋，放到法院里，掩藏在司法手续的伪装下去进行。他们希望把施威伦巴和孟特——尼克逊的提议所不能在国会中完成的工作，放到法院中去完成它。
    美国人民不愿意共产党被宣布为非法。这是并不需要美国多数人民都同意它的政纲才如此的，而是因为群众认识了，宣布我党为非法将危害美国的——仅剩的一点点民主。我们要充分了解这事件的意义，并诉之于抱各种政治见解的人民之前。　　　　　　　（水拍译）
