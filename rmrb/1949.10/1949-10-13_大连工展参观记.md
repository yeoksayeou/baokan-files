A Visit to the Dalian Industrial Exhibition
　　Zhao Gengwu
        I
    Recently, Dalian held an industrial exhibition, divided into sixteen pavilions: Railway Transportation, Machinery, Construction Materials, Shipbuilding, Public Utilities, Textiles, Chemicals, Communications Equipment, Daily Use Industrial Products, Food Industry, Aquatic Agriculture and Forestry, Health Care, Culture and Education, and Sino-Soviet Friendship. Inside, there were various statistical charts and full-scale models of various machines that could operate on their own, just like the real thing.
    Dalian is an industrial city with large-scale factories, such as Dalian Shipyard, Sino-Soviet Machinery Factory, Jianxin Company (including many factories in Dalian, Guanghe, etc.), Far East Electric Power Company (including many factories in electricity, cement, glass, etc.), Jinzhou Textile Factory (with 100,000 spindles in Jinzhou), and various other factories such as matches, papermaking, alcohol, enamel, tobacco, rubber, and chemical products.
    There are hundreds of thousands of excellent male and female workers here. Over the past four years, under the correct leadership of the Party, the people of the Lüda area have overcome the blockade by the Kuomintang bandit gang and weathered a difficult period. Today, they have progressed from stabilizing people's lives to improving them. They have formulated a two-year construction plan, signed collective contracts guaranteeing employee benefits, and the new Lüda, the new workers, have emerged as masters of their own destiny; they have truly become the masters of the new society.
    At the industrial exhibition, we can see the various machines that workers have painstakingly researched, created, invented, or improved. The mechanical pavilion displays a precise and valuable balance, the first one workers managed to produce. In the past, its value was 1 million yuan (Kwantung currency), but now it is only worth 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. We no longer need to buy foreign ones at high prices.
    The workers in the fishing net factory have invented their own net weaving machine and are now learning to use it. From now on, net weaving can be done without manual labor.
    The tobacco company has also improved the box-pasting machine, which had been reformed many times by the Japanese invaders but failed. After more than two months of research by our workers, it was finally successful.
    Dalian Shipyard has even produced a special-class hero, who modified a new type of boiler, changing its cylindrical shape to a curved one. This type of boiler is many times stronger than the old type when used.
    Lüda Shipbuilding Company, which could only repair or assemble ready-made machines during the Japanese occupation, has now, through the efforts of the workers, built its own ships. In the two-year plan, the government called for the manufacture of large ships, and the worker comrades said that they were confident and would definitely complete the task.
    The paper mill, which could only produce burning paper (for superstitious items) and toilet paper during the Japanese occupation, has, after the liberation of Dalian, been improved by the efforts of the workers and now produces a large amount of newsprint for the Lüda area and has also produced more than ten other types of paper for various uses, with products improving year by year.
    In the communications equipment pavilion, three hand-cranked generators are placed in front of us. Please compare the Japanese, Kuomintang military, and Lüda-made ones. We can crank them ourselves, and ours has the least noise, is the lightest, and requires the least effort.
    In the handicraft pavilion, there is a vegetable cutting machine created by the workers themselves, which is small, flexible, and inexpensive. Mass production is now being prepared.
    …There are so many such facts that it is impossible to list them all.
    　　　　II
    This summer, a windstorm struck the Liaodong Peninsula, and Lüda bore the brunt. Strong winds and heavy rain knocked down many trees in Dalian, and power lines were broken, preventing people from going out. However, the factories in Dalian did not stop working. They replaced electricity with diesel engines and continued to work, determined not to let the machines stop producing. In this way, a large number of labor heroes and model workers emerged in various factories.
    The lives of the workers in the Lüda area are many times better than in the past. During the Kuomintang bandit army's blockade, the general public could not even get enough sorghum rice and cornmeal to eat. Now, prices in Lüda are falling daily. Ordinary workers can generally get 6,000 to 7,000 yuan (Kwantung currency) in wages per month and free clothing. They also have comfortable accommodations.
    Each factory has its own cooperative, where various daily necessities can be bought at half the market price. They all have their own free hospitals for medical treatment, and can get free baths and haircuts. There are also free nurseries, kindergartens, and elementary schools. Female workers also have regular vacations during childbirth. They have also signed collective contracts that clearly stipulate the various benefits that workers should enjoy. Workers' lives are more securely guaranteed.
    Each factory has organized its own clubs and night schools, often performing plays or showing movies for the workers' entertainment, and various ball games are available for the workers' exercise. Workers can learn culture and technology in night schools to improve themselves. For example, the comrades responsible for explaining to us visitors at the industrial exhibition have only attended school for two or three years, or even not at all. However, after years of study, they have acquired culture, some at least at the junior high school level. At the same time, their sincere attitude and enthusiasm are something we have never seen before.
    Under the correct leadership of the Party, the women of Lüda have also truly been liberated. Women serve as streetcar and train drivers, factory directors, technicians, and workers. Wherever men work, women work as well. Even in the most laborious work of sand turning, a large number of women are participating. They are completely economically independent, and they are role models for women! Like the female hero Qi Guizhi of the Sino-Soviet Machinery Factory, she takes three apprentices with her, and her work efficiency exceeds that of everyone else. Such female heroes have also emerged in large numbers.
    　　　　III
    The night I arrived in Dalian, I went for a walk on the street, and there were very few people, which made me feel strange. I looked through the brightly lit glass window of a building and saw rows of women writing quietly - this is the literacy class in various streets of Dalian. In the Lüda area, all men and women under the age of 45 must participate in learning. They stipulate that anyone who does not recognize 1,200 characters is considered illiterate. After years of study, illiteracy has basically been eliminated in the entire Lüda area.
    Beggars, hooligans, and thieves have disappeared in the Lüda area. There is a labor primary school here that specializes in accommodating children who have no relatives or home. They used to be thieves, but after education and learning, they have been reformed. When the industrial exhibition opened, they participated, and each one was white and chubby, and the workers liked them very much.
    On October 2nd, I participated in a mass rally of more than 100,000 people in Dalian (Dalian has a population of about 300,000). Various neat and majestic teams entered the venue to the accompaniment of military trumpets. The neatness and orderliness of all aspects is not seen in other cities.
    　　　　IV
    During the Kuomintang bandit gang's blockade, the people's lives were very difficult. In order to help the people of Lüda solve the problem of production, the Soviet Union helped us establish a fishing net factory. They also sent us machines. In some factories, there are Soviet technicians and Soviet workers. They get along with the Chinese people like brothers. They helped us improve our technology, improve our factories, and introduced various Soviet experiences.
    Dalian—it is a healthy, beautiful, and simple city, clean and orderly everywhere. It is a production city with no idle people who do not work.

　　大连工展参观记
    赵庚午
        一
    最近大连开办了工业展览会，共分作铁路交通、机械、建设器材、造船、公用事业、纺织、化学、通讯器材、日用品工业、食品工业、水产农林、卫生保健、文化教育、中苏友谊等十六个馆，里边有各种统计图表，有各种机器全套模型，能自己开动，和真的一样。
    大连是一个工业城市，他有大规模的工厂。象大连船渠，中长机厂、建新公司（包括大连、广和等许多工厂）、远东电业公司（包括电气、洋灰、玻璃等许多工厂）、金州纺织厂（在金州有纱锭十万锭）等，其他如火柴、造纸、酒精、珐琅、烟草、橡胶、化学药品等各种工厂，应有尽用。
    这里有十几万优秀的男女工人。旅大地区的人们，四年来在党的正确领导下，战胜了国民党匪帮的封锁，渡过了艰苦的阶段；而今日，已由安定人民生活提高到改善人民生活了，他们制定了两年建设计划，订立了保障职工福利的集体合同，新的旅大，新的工人们，已经以主人翁的姿态出现了，他们已真正成了新社会的主人。
    在工展里，我们可以看到工人们苦心钻研创造发明或改进的各种机器。机械馆里陈列的一架精确贵重的天平，那是工人们试制出来的第一架，过去价值要一百万元（关东币）现在仅值二三十万元了，我们不用再以高价去买外国的了。
    渔网工厂的工人们，自己发明了织网机，现在正学习使用，此后，织网可不用手工了。
    烟草公司，也改进了糊盒机，这是日寇时改革过多次都失败的。经过我们工人两个多月的研究，终于成功了。
    大连船渠更出现了特等英雄，他改制了新型锅炉，它是将圆筒状改为带弯曲的，这种锅炉使用起来，较之旧式的，要坚固许多倍的。
    旅大造船公司，在日寇时只能修理或按装现成机器的，今日经工人们的努力，自己造出了轮船。在两年计划中，政府号召制造大船，工人同志们表示，他们是有把握的，一定能定成任务的。
    日寇时仅能造烧纸（迷信品）手纸的造纸厂，大连解放后，经工人们的努力改进，现在已出产了大量的新闻纸，供旅大区应用，并另外制出各种不同用途的纸十余种，产品是一年比一年优良的。
    通讯器材馆里，摆在我们面前三架手摇发电机，请你比较：日寇的、国民党军用的、旅大自己制造的，我们可以亲自摇一摇，而我们的声音最小，最轻快，最省力的。
    手工业馆里，有工人自己创作的切菜机，小巧灵便，成本低廉。现正准备大批制作。
    ……这样事实太多了，是无法说完的。
    　　　　二
    今年夏季刮风袭击辽东半岛，旅大首当其冲，狂风暴雨，大连市的许多树木，都被刮倒了，输电路被刮断了，人们都不能出门。但是大连市的工厂没有停工，他们以柴油机代替了电力，继续工作，决不能让机器停止生产。这样的，各工厂中都拥现了大批的劳动英雄、工作模范。
    旅大地区的工人生活，比过去不知强了多少倍，象被国民党匪军封锁时期，一般人民，连高粱米和苞米面都吃不饱或吃不上的，现在旅大的物价，日渐下落。他们一般的普通工人，每月都能得到六、七千元的工薪（关东币）和免费的衣服。并有了舒适的住处。
    各工厂中都有了自己的合作社，可以低于市面一倍的价格买到各种生活必需品，他们都有自己免费治病的医院，都能得到免费洗澡与理发，还有免费的托儿所、幼稚园与小学校。女工生育期间，并有定期的休假。他们更订立了集体合同，明文规定了工人应享有的各种福利。工人们的生活，是更有确切的保障。
    各工厂中都组织了自己的俱乐部与夜校，时常演剧或放映电影供工人们消遣，有各种球类供工人们运动。工人们在夜校中可以学习文化，学习技术，提高自己。就拿在工展中负责给我们观众讲解的同志们来说，他们有的仅上过二、三年学，甚至有的没有上过学。但是经过几年来的学习，他们已有了文化，有的至少有了初中的程度。同时他们诚恳的态度和热情，是我们从来没有见过的。
    在党的正确领导下，旅大的妇女们也真正获得了解放，电车火车司机、工厂厂长、技师、工人都有妇女充当，有男人工作的地方就有女人工作，甚至最费力气的翻砂工作，也有大批的妇女参加了。她们在经济上完全独立了，她们是妇女的榜样！象中长机厂的女英雄戚桂芝，自己带着三个徒弟，而工作效率还超过所有的人。这样的女英雄也大批出现了。
    　　　　三
    刚到大连的那天晚上，到街上去散步，路上的人是非常稀少，不禁叫人感到奇怪。我从一家电灯明亮的玻璃窗内望，看到一排排安安静静的妇女们在写字——这就是大连各街的识字班。旅大地区自四十五岁以下的男女，都必须参加学习，他们规定，凡识字不足一千二百个的，都算做文盲。经过几年来的学习，现在旅大全区，文盲基本上已扫除了。
    旅大区，乞丐、流氓、小偷之流绝迹了。这里有一所劳动小学，专收容一些无亲无家的孩子，他们过去是小偷之类的，经过教育学习，改造了他们，工展开幕时，他们去参加，一个个白胖胖的，工人们对他们喜欢极了。
    十月二日，参加大连十余万人的大集会（大连市约有三十万人），各种整齐雄壮的队伍在军号伴奏中进入会场，各方面的整齐与有秩序，是其他都市看不到的。
    　　　　四
    在国民党匪帮封锁时，人民生活十分困苦，苏联为了帮助旅大人民解决生产问题，曾帮助我们建立了渔网工厂。更送给了我们机器。有的工厂，有苏联技师也有苏联工人，他们和中国人相处如兄弟一样，他们帮助了我们提高技术，改进工厂，介绍了苏联的各种经验。
    大连——它是个健美朴素的城市，各处都是清洁有秩序。它是个生产城市，没有不劳动的闲人。
