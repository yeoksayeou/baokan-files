The National Railway Locomotive Depot and Workshop Joint Maintenance Conference Concludes
    Formulating November Maintenance Plan Lays Foundation for Completing Next Year's Tasks
    Minister Teng Calls for Implementation

    [This Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Railways' National Locomotive Depot and Workshop Joint Maintenance Conference concluded successfully yesterday (the 26th). Minister Teng Daiyuan attended and spoke. The conference formulated a maintenance plan for factory sections in November, laying the foundation for completing the tasks in 1950. The plan includes: specific production figures for each locomotive depot and railway factory, in-depth and rigorous inspection of locomotives under trusteeship, all-out effort to revive "dead" locomotives in addition to scheduled maintenance, stipulated standard quantities of machine tools for locomotive depots, and production plans for various important spare parts and wheels. In terms of locomotive quality, ensure that no temporary repairs occur during locomotive scheduled maintenance, strive to effectively save coal, completely eliminate water rust from all major and medium-repaired locomotives, strictly implement Grade B cleaning inspections according to scheduled mileage, install boiler insulation devices and firebricks on all locomotives, ensure that locomotive idling leakage meets standard requirements, and eliminate overheating accidents.

    In his speech, Minister Teng Daiyuan pointed out that the November maintenance plan was formulated after detailed study by the representatives and with the assistance of Soviet experts, and it must be implemented. He also raised issues that should be noted in future work: (1) Understand the situation and be familiar with the situation. Today, we have become the masters of the people's railways, and we must thoroughly understand our property and strength, cherish our property, and be good at using and protecting the tools that serve the people. Leading comrades at all levels must regularly go deep into the field to understand the situation. (2) The plan is the program of action, not the business of a few people, but everyone must do it, and everyone must guarantee its realization. The plan must be discussed by the workers and masses and turned into mass action. In the implementation of the plan, supervision and inspection should be carried out regularly. (3) The responsibility system is the basic principle of the management of the people's railways, and it must be implemented in everyone's work to completely eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible. (4) The issue of discipline is an important issue for the people's railways. To complete the state's transportation tasks, strict discipline must be established, and discipline education must be carried out among employees to ensure the full realization of the tasks. (5) Advocate the spirit of hard work to build the family, fully utilize production capacity, overcome difficulties, and launch a conservation movement. (6) To do a good job, we must learn with an open mind. Learning from the Soviet Union is the main direction. In the South and North, we must also learn from the advanced Northeast region.
