Workers and students in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, are celebrating the founding of the People's Republic of China with practical actions of increasing production and strengthening their studies.

Liu Dixing, a worker at the factory, said, "The Central People's Government has been established, and we have seized the knife handle (referring to political power) to suppress the reactionaries and strike at the imperialist warmongers. The best gift we can give to the new China is to increase production and support the front lines."

    【新华社长沙三日电】湖南省会长沙市工人、学生，纷纷以增加生产和加强学习的实际行动来庆祝中华人民共和国的成立。公营锑品制造厂的职工们决定自十月一日至三日每晚加班三小时，不要加班费，把增产的产品作为对中央人民政府的贺礼。该厂工人刘迪鑫说；“中央人民政府成立了，我们拿到了刀把子（指政权），要镇压反动派，打击帝国主义好战分子。我们对新中国最好的贺礼，就是增加生产支援前线。”省公路局修车厂也自动延长工作一小时，并展开竞赛。邮政局职工召开了业务检讨会，以改进业务来庆祝人民政府诞生。各大、中学校连日掀起了学习人民政协及拥护国际和平文件的热潮。
