Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th -- TASS, Rome: Fifty thousand Italian working people held a national celebration rally in Florence on the 25th to celebrate the victorious conclusion of the "Communist Party Newspaper Month" movement. This movement was organized by the Italian Communist Party to increase the sales of party newspapers and raise 300 million lira in funding for the party. Worker delegations from all over the country brought congratulations from the people of various regions to the meeting. In a magnificent parade demonstration held before the meeting, members of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party led the procession through the main streets of the city. Demonstrators held up various flags and portraits of Lenin, Stalin, Togliatti, Mao Zedong, and other leaders of the working class, as well as various banners with slogans calling for defending peace, congratulating the Communist Party newspapers, and defending the demands of the Italian working people. It took the entire procession three and a half hours to pass the podium where the leaders of the Italian Communist Party were standing.

On the evening of the same day, a celebration rally was held in the park, which was filled with working people listening to speeches broadcast by hundreds of loudspeakers. When the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti, began to speak at the meeting, the entire venue immediately erupted into enthusiastic cheers from hundreds of thousands of people. Togliatti pointed out: The celebration in Florence is one of the most moving rallies among the many celebrations and demonstrations held in various cities in Italy to commemorate "Communist Party Newspaper Month." He said: Three million workers participated in the celebrations in less than a month. The working people expressed their trust in the Italian Communist Party with unprecedented enthusiasm. This is because it has led them through hundreds of struggles and will lead the Italian people to victory in future struggles. Togliatti also criticized the reactionary foreign and domestic policies of the Gasperi government in his speech, saying: The time has come to fundamentally change the direction of our country's policies in order to prevent the reactionaries from pushing our country onto the ruins. We demand to take a new path, that is, to have the major parties representing the laboring masses participate in guiding national life and redrafting national policies so that the country embarks on an independent path. We are full of confidence in the future, because the advancement of the labor force cannot be stopped.

At the celebration meeting, the Deputy General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Longo, also delivered a speech on behalf of the "L'Unità Friends Group," explaining that due to the party's persistent efforts in disseminating printed materials, the Sunday edition sales of L'Unità had repeatedly reached one million copies, which is unprecedented in Italian history.

　　意五十万劳动人民盛大集会
    庆祝共产党报纸月胜利结束
    充分表达他们对意共的信任
    【新华社北京二十九日电】塔斯社罗马讯：意大利五十万劳动人民于二十五日在佛罗伦萨举行全国庆祝大会，庆祝“共产党报纸月”运动的胜利结束。这一运动是意共为增加党报销路及为党筹募三亿里拉经费而组织的。全国各地工人代表团给大会带来了各地人民的庆贺。在会前举行的雄伟游行示威中，意共中央委员们领导行列穿过城市各大街道。示威者高举着各种旗帜及列宁、斯大林、托格里亚蒂、毛泽东及其他工人阶级领袖的画像，与写着保卫和平、祝贺共产党报纸及保卫意大利劳动人民要求的口号的各种标语牌。行列全部通过意共领袖们站立的主席台，共历时三个半钟头。
    当日晚上，在公园举行庆祝大会，劳动人民挤满了整个公园，静听由数百个扩音器播出来的演说。当意共产党总书记托格里亚蒂开始在会上演说时，全场立即响起了数十万人的狂热欢呼。托格里亚蒂指出：佛罗伦萨的庆祝是意大利各城市中为纪念“共产党报纸月”而举行的许多庆祝和示威中最动人的大会之一。他说：在不满一个月时间中参加了庆祝的有三百万工人。劳动人民以空前的热情，表达他们对意大利共产党的信任。这是因为它曾领导他们经历过数百次的斗争，且将领导意大利人民在未来的斗争中获得胜利。托氏并于演说中抨击加斯贝利政府的反动外交与内政政策，他说：为了阻止反动派把我们国家推上废墟，根本改变我国政策的方向的时刻已经到来。我们要求走新的道路，即是由代表劳动群众的各大党参加指导国民生活，重订国家政策，使国家走上独立的道路。我们对未来充满信心，因为劳工力量的前进是不能阻遏的。
    在庆祝会上意共副总书记隆哥亦曾代表“团结报之友小组”发表演说，说明由于党在传布印刷品方面的坚持努力，团结报星期版销数曾屡次达到一百万份，这在意大利历史上是空前的。
