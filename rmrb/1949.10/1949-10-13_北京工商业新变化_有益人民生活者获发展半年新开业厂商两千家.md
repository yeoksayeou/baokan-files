Beijing News: New Changes in Beijing's Industry and Commerce

Those Beneficial to the People's Livelihood are Developing; Two Thousand New Factories and Merchants Opened in Half a Year

[Beijing News] Since the Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau began handling industrial and commercial registration in March, a total of 2,479 new industrial and commercial households have registered and opened for business in the half-year ending at the end of August. 1,125 households closed down, and 244 changed professions. Among the 2,479 newly registered and opened households, 1,874 households belong to 78 types of commercial businesses. Among them, the grain industry accounts for 326 households, oil, salt, and groceries account for 309 households, coal shops account for 287 households, and the food industry accounts for 97 households. These four industries alone account for more than half of the total number of households. 605 households belonging to 37 types of industrial businesses. Among them, handmade cigarettes account for 95 households, soap making accounts for 93 households, machine iron industry accounts for 62 households, and flour mills account for 49 households. These four industries account for slightly less than half of the total number of households. Among the 1,125 households registered for closure, 959 households belong to commercial businesses, mostly silk, antiques, jade, used clothing, gold and silver jewelry, cigarettes, cloth, oil, wine, and groceries. 166 households belong to industrial businesses, mostly garment making, leather making (originally fur), soap making, knitting, weaving and dyeing, copper, iron, and tin utensils, etc. Among the 244 households registered for change of profession, 115 households are in the gold and silver jewelry industry, 13 households are in the cloth industry, followed by stationery, knitting, department stores, and food industries. From the above figures, it can be seen that the changes in Beijing's industry and commerce after liberation are very significant, manifested in: (1) More openings than closures. The number of closures is less than half of the number of openings, which shows that the number of industrial and commercial households has increased after liberation. (2) The industries that are opening are mostly industries that meet the needs of daily life, such as grain, coal, oil, salt, groceries, soap, cigarettes, and the machine iron industry, etc., accounting for the majority of openings, while there are no new openings in the luxury goods industry. (3) The industries that are closing are mostly those that do not meet the daily needs of the masses, such as antiques, jade, gold and silver jewelry, used clothing, and silk industries. (4) From the number of households changing professions, the gold and silver jewelry industry ranks first, followed by distilleries, oil and wine, Western-style clothing, cloth industry, and second-hand goods. The industries that they are switching to are mostly grain industry, knitting, and stationery.

The above changes are mainly due to our implementation of correct urban industrial and commercial policies. In addition to carrying out industrial and commercial registration, we also provide guidance on specialized operations in individual major industries. For example, in order to prevent blind production and shoddy manufacturing, we have proposed that the management of the soap and cigarette industries should be strengthened. Based on market needs, we have successively determined that grain stations, grain cargo stations, and rice and flour grain industries should temporarily suspend registration.

　　北京工商业新变化
    有益人民生活者获发展半年新开业厂商两千家
    【北京讯】本市人民政府工商局自三月份开始办理工商业登记以来，截至八月底止的半年中新的工商户登记开业的共二千四百七十九户，歇业的一千一百二十五户，转业的二百四十四户。新登记开业的二千四百七十九户中属于商业性质的七十八业计一千八百七十四户。其中粮食业占三百二十六户，油盐杂货三百零九户，煤铺二百八十七户，食品业九十七户，仅此四业即占总户数二分之一以上。属于工业性质的三十七业计六百零五户。其中手工卷烟九十五户，造胰九十三户，机器铁工业六十二户，粉房四十九户，此四业占总户数二分之一弱。歇业登记的一千一百二十五户中，属于商业性质的九百五十九户，以绸缎、古玩、玉器、估衣、金银饰物、纸烟、布、油、酒、杂货为多。属于工业性质的一百六十六户，以成衣、制革（原为皮毛）造胰、针织、织染、铜铁锡器等为多。转业登记的二百四十四户中，金银饰物业一百一十五户，布业有十三户、其次文具、针织、百货、食粮等业转业亦多。从以上数字看来，解放后京市工商业变化很大，表现在：（一）开业比歇业多。歇业的不及开业的一半，这说明解放后工商业户是增加了。（二）开业的行业多为日常生活需要的行业，如粮、煤、油、盐、杂货、肥皂、纸烟以及机器铁工业等，占了开业的最多数，而奢侈品行业则没有新开业者。（三）歇业的行业多为不切合群众日常生活所需要的，如古玩、玉器、金银饰物、估衣、绸缎业等。（四）从转业户数看，金银饰物业占了第一位，其次为烧锅、油酒、西服、布业及旧货等。所转入的行业则为粮业，针织、文具等占大多数。
    以上这些变化，主要乃是由于我们贯彻执行正确的城市工商业政策的结果，除进行工商业登记外，并对个别主要行业的专行专业加以指导，如为了防止盲目生产和粗制滥造，曾对肥皂纸烟业提出应当加强管理；又根据市场需要情况曾先后确定粮栈、粮货栈与米面粮业暂时停止登记。
