Little Red Riding Hood Escapes Danger 11
    Mei Zhi
    The old mountain demon,
    Truly relieved,
    Suddenly ran to the dilapidated thatched hut,
    Suddenly grabbed the broken wooden door.

    The wooden door was too old and too broken,
    Terrible!
    His black hand opened it at once!
    The wooden door was too short and too small,
    Terrible!
    His black hairy foot stretched over the threshold at once!
    Terrible,
    He was bending over, shrinking his body to crawl inside...

    At this moment,
    From the corner of the door flashed out
    The little blacksmith and Little Red Riding Hood,
    One holding a hammer,
    A hammer to the head!
    One holding a steel knife,
    A knife to the chest!

    Ouch—
    The old mountain demon,
    Had no time to speak, no time to shout,
    With a hole in his head,
    With a knife in his chest,
    Tumbled and stumbled as he fled.

    You flee!
    You flee!
    See where you can escape to?
    If you escape to the ends of the earth,
    We will chase you to the ends of the earth!
    If you escape to the edge of the sky,
    We will chase you to the edge of the sky!

    Chase!
    Chase!
    For the sake of countless Little Red Riding Hoods
    And the dreams they dream,
    We must catch you!
    For the sake of countless little blacksmiths
    And their mothers' hands and fathers' legs,
    We must eliminate you!

    The old mountain demon,
    Has done enough evil,
    Has harmed enough people,
    Hadn't even escaped to the foot of the mountain,
    Before collapsing by the roadside.

    Hahaha,
    He can't move anymore!
    Hahaha,
    His eyes will never close again!
    Hahaha,
    His claws and teeth are useless now!

    Long live!
    Little Red Riding Hood,
    You have escaped danger!
    Long live!
    Little blacksmith,
    You have triumphed!

    Little Red Riding Hood hugs the little blacksmith,
    The little blacksmith hugs Little Red Riding Hood,
    Jumping and singing,
    Singing and laughing.

    Hahaha,
    The bright red sun has come out!
    Hahaha,
    The bright red sun has come out!

    The sun is so bright,
    The sun shines everywhere,
    The sun is so red,
    Everyone works hard.

    Little yellow dog,
    Don't be afraid, be less greedy and come quickly,
    Come to guard, come to hunt!
    Big white horse,
    Don't be afraid, grumble less and come quickly,
    Come to pull carts, come to plow the fields!
    Old honeybee,
    Don't be afraid, sing less mountain songs and come quickly,
    Come to gather flowers, come to make honey!

    Come quickly,
    Come quickly!
    The sun is ours!
    Come quickly,
    Come quickly!
    The world is ours!

    All came,
    All came!
    So many,
    So many!
    Following Little Red Riding Hood,
    Following the little blacksmith,
    Walking,
    Laughing,
    Laughing,
    And singing.

    Little blacksmith
    Clang, clang,
    Little Red Riding Hood,
    Sway, sway,
    Walking forward,
    Running forward.

    Where are they going?
    Where are they running to?
    To build a big garden,
    To build a big colorful bridge.

　　小红帽脱险记１１
    梅志
    老山妖，
    真正放了心，
    一下子跑到了破茅屋，
    一下子抓住了破柴门。
　
    柴门太老又太破，
    不得了
    一下子被他的黑手打开了！
    柴门太矮又太小，
    不得了
    一下子他的黑毛脚就伸进门槛来了！
    不得了，
    他正在弯着腰，缩着身体向里钻……
　
    这时候
    从门角里闪出了
    小铁匠和小红帽，
    一个拿着铁锤，
    当头一锤！
    一个拿着钢刀，
    当胸一刀！
　
    哎哟——
    老山妖，
    来不及说话来不及叫，
    头上带着一个洞，
    胸口带着一把刀，
    滚滚跌跌的就往外逃。
　
    你逃！
    你逃！
    看你逃到哪？
    你逃到海角，
    咱们追到海角！
    你逃到天涯，
    咱们追到天涯！
　
    追呀！
    追呀！
    为了无数的小红帽
    和他们做的梦，
    咱们一定要捉住你！
    为了无数的小铁匠
    和他们妈妈的手爸爸的腿，
    咱们一定要消灭你！
　
    老山妖，
    作恶作够了，
    害人害满了，
    还没有逃到山脚下，
    就一个筋斗倒在路边了。
　
    哈哈哈，
    他一动也不能动了！
    哈哈哈，
    他的眼睛永远闭不拢了！
    哈哈哈，
    他的爪子牙齿再也没有用了！
　
    万岁！
    小红帽，
    你脱险了！
    万岁！
    小铁匠，
    你胜利了！
　
    小红帽抱着小铁匠，
    小铁匠抱着小红帽，
    一面跳，一面唱，
    一面唱，又一面笑。
　
    哈哈哈，
    鲜红的太阳出来了！
    哈哈哈，
    鲜红的太阳出来了！
　
    太阳那么亮，
    太阳照四方，
    太阳那么红，
    大家好做工。
　
    小黄狗，
    不要怕，你少贪小利快来吧，
    来放哨，来打猎！
    大白马，
    不要怕，你少发牢骚快来吧，
    来拖车，来耕地！
    老蜜蜂
    不要怕，你少唱山歌快来吧，
    来采花，来酿蜜！
　
    快来吧，
    快来呀！
    太阳是我们的！
    快来吧，
    快来呀！
    世界是我们的！
　
    都来了，
    都来了！
    那么多，
    那么多！
    跟着小红帽，
    跟着小铁匠，
    一面走，
    一面笑，
    一面笑，
    又一面唱。
　
    小铁匠
    叮呀当，
    小红帽，
    扭呀摇，
    向前走，
    向前跑。
　
    走到哪里去？
    跑到哪里去？
    去造一座大花园，
    去造一座大彩桥。
