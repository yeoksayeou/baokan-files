North China General Supply and Marketing Cooperative Holds Statistics Conference

[This Newspaper reports] The North China General Supply and Marketing Cooperative convened its first regional cooperative statistics conference on the 17th to study the establishment and improvement of statistical work. Eleven cadres in charge of statistical work from the general cooperatives of various provinces and cities attended, and representatives from the Central Finance and Economics Committee and the Cooperative Bank also participated. Meng Yongqian, Director of the General Cooperative, pointed out in his opening remarks: In the past, in the rural environment, there was no formal reporting system. North China has been completely liberated for several months, and the slogan of urban-rural material exchange has been put forward for a long time, but there are few reliable figures on what is produced in various places, how much is produced, where it should be exchanged, and how much should be exchanged. There is also a lack of accurate surveys and statistics on what members need the cooperative to supply and sell, which affects the development of work. Even the allocation of cadres and funds is difficult. If we do not make up our minds to seriously establish statistical work, then the cooperative work will not be able to be carried out in the future, and the policies of worker-peasant alliance and urban-rural mutual assistance cannot be well implemented. Director Liang also pointed out in his supplementary speech that due to poor statistical techniques and careless work, statistical reports often have problems such as failing to fill in the date and place, adding up numbers incorrectly, inconsistent units, and failing to indicate the local currency, which makes it difficult for those reading the reports to understand the true situation, losing the role and significance of statistics. Subsequently, representatives of the Finance and Economics Committee explained the principles of the statistical reporting system and the design intentions and usage methods of the forms, and then group discussions were conducted, combined with the actual situation, to study whether there were any omissions or inappropriate items in the forms and whether there were any difficulties in filling them out, and many valuable opinions were put forward on reporting relationships, institutions, and cadres. In Director Liang's summary report on the afternoon of the 19th, he called on everyone to overcome difficulties, and pointed out: 1. Statistical work is not only the work of statistical personnel or statistical departments. Statistical figures come from various business departments, so it should attract the attention of all cadres. Those responsible for statistical work should contact various departments, patiently persuade and help subordinates, and gradually establish statistical work. 2. Establish specialized statistical institutions from top to bottom. The general cooperatives of provinces and cities should establish statistical sections, and the special districts and county cooperatives should set up statistical secretaries. Each business department should designate a special person to concurrently manage statistical work, which should be led by the statistical section and statistical secretary in addition to the leadership of the department. Reports should be submitted to the superior cooperative on time, and the subordinate cooperative should be responsible for supervising and inspecting at each level and provide specific assistance. 3. The scope of statistics does not emphasize the distinction between old and new. All those who have business relations with the county cooperative and are willing to accept leadership should be included in the statistics. Unify units, using the municipal dou, municipal chi, municipal jin, and Renminbi as units. In order to conduct typical investigations and help analyze the situation, the General Cooperative requires each province and city to attach the original materials of one-tenth of the key county cooperatives, and stipulates that it will be implemented from November 1st, and starting from January next year, it requires the complete establishment of survey forms on the status of cooperative affairs, finance, business, personnel, etc., as well as production, credit, and major supply and marketing business survey forms.

　　华北供销总社召开统计会议
    【本报讯】华北供销总社于十七日召开第一次全区合作社统计会议，研究建立与健全统计工作问题。到有各省、市总社负责统计工作的干部十一人，并有中央财委会及合作银行等机关派员参加。总社孟用潜主任于开会词中指出：过去在农村环境中，没有正规的报告制度，华北全部解放已数月，城乡物资交流的口号提出已久，但各地出产什么，出产多少，应向何地交流及交流多少，都缺少可靠数字；究竟社员需要合作社供给什么，推销什么，也缺乏精确的调查统计；因此影响工作的开展，即配备干部和调拨资金也感到困难，如果不下决心，认真建立统计工作，则今后合作工作无法开展，工农联合，城乡互助的政策，也不能很好贯彻下去。梁主任补充发言中也指出，由于统计技术不好和工作粗心，统计表报中又时常发现不填日期地点，数字加错，单位不统一，不注明本位币等毛病，使看表的人很难了解真实情况，失去统计的作用和意义。继由财委会代表说明统计报告制度原则和表格的设计意图和使用办法后，即进行分组研究，结合实际情况，研究表格中的项目有无缺漏不当之处及具体填造时有无困难，并对汇报关系、机构干部等提出许多宝贵意见。十九日下午梁主任总结报告中号召大家克服困难，并指出：一、统计工作不单是统计人员或统计部门的工作，统计数字来自各个业务部门，所以应引起全体干部注意；负责做统计工作的要联系各部门、对下级耐心说服帮助，逐步建立起统计工作。二、自上而下的建立专门统计机构，省、市总社设立统计科、专区、县社设统计秘书，各业务部门应指定专人兼管统计工作，除受本部门领导外，并受统计科、统计秘书领导。对上级社要按期汇报，对下级社要逐级负责督促检查，具体帮助。三、统计范围，不强调新旧之分，凡与县社有业务关系并愿接受领导者，都应统计在内。统一单位，一律以市斗市尺市斤及人民币为单位。为了进行典型调查和帮助分析情况，总社要求各省市附报十分之一的重点县社的原始材料，并规定十一月一日起开始实行，明年一月份起要求把社务、财务、业务、人事等状况调查与生产、信贷、及主要的供销业务调查表等完全建立起来。（晓之、重）
