　　The "Three Autumns" Campaign in the North China Region
    Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government
    General Situation

    I. Protecting the Autumn Harvest: In order to reliably protect the fruits of the farmers' year of hard work, each province organized the masses and rectified the militia before the autumn harvest to carry out a mass-based campaign to protect the autumn harvest. Villages universally organized autumn harvest protection committees, established autumn harvest protection covenants, formed militia autumn harvest protection squads, carried out joint defense patrols, and controlled opium addicts and idlers, requiring them to engage in production during the day and sleep together at night, changing the old practice of hiring opium addicts and idlers. Shahe County in Hebei Province proposed "Everyone has an autumn harvest, everyone protects the autumn harvest!" to mobilize the strength of the masses and suppress the sabotage activities of a small number of special agents, bandits, and lawless elements. As a result, the autumn harvest order in various places was generally good, and theft in the new districts was greatly reduced compared to previous years. However, in individual areas, due to the leadership's failure to pay attention in a timely manner, some lazy people who did not engage in production, as well as special agents and saboteurs, took the opportunity to steal and destroy. In some places, the guiding principles for protecting the autumn harvest were not clear, so simple punishment measures were taken against gleaners and petty thieves. The Longyao County government in Hebei Province even mistakenly issued a notice prohibiting gleaning.

    Secondly, it was necessary to prevent frost damage. In the Jin southeast area of Shanxi Province, counties universally established frost prevention platforms. In He Shun alone, there were 5,455 platforms, with more than 43,000 dan of firewood prepared, which played a significant role in preventing frost.

    II. Autumn Harvest Seed Selection: Autumn harvest began in various places at the end of August and the beginning of September. By September 8th, the autumn harvest work had fully unfolded throughout the region, and it was largely completed by mid-October. Most of the grain was stored, with only yams and peanuts yet to be fully harvested, and cotton had been picked four or five times.

    This year, special attention was paid to seed selection during the autumn harvest (previously, there was little organized leadership). Propaganda and explanations were carried out through symposiums with village cadres, Communist Party members, activists, and experienced farmers, or by organizing visits and demonstrations. Therefore, in areas where there was a foundation for seed selection, it was carried out comprehensively; in areas where there was no foundation, bases were established, laying the groundwork for next year. For example, Chahar regarded field seed selection as one of the three major tasks in autumn production, so the province achieved the greatest results in seed selection. In the Chabei and Yanbei special districts alone, 25,659 shi of wheat, naked oats, yams, and other seeds were selected. In Chanan, about 70% of households selected seeds. In other areas, such as 16 districts and 56 villages in 10 counties including Suning and Xingtang in Hebei Province, 282,118 jin of seeds had been selected. In some villages in Mancheng and Ding County, 80% of households participated in field seed selection.

    III. Autumn Plowing and Wheat Sowing: Each province required universal autumn plowing, putting forward slogans such as "One family doesn't plow in the autumn, a thousand families suffer from pests!" "A good autumn plowing this year, a good harvest next year!" and "The ground doesn't freeze, the plow doesn't stop!" These slogans played a great role in promoting autumn plowing among the masses. In Chahar and Suiyuan provinces, more than 58% of the land had already been autumn-plowed, and it was estimated that the figure could reach 80%. In Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shanxi, under the intense call of "harvesting and plowing as crops ripen," wheat sowing was also largely completed by mid-October. Most of the wheat seedlings had emerged from the soil, and autumn plowing was now in full swing. In order to solve the problem of wheat seed shortages among the masses during wheat sowing, the leadership both mobilized the masses to help and borrow from each other and distributed wheat seeds from the government. Hebei Province distributed 17 million jin, and Pingyuan Province distributed 6 million jin. Many special districts and counties also took out wheat from local granaries to lend or exchange to the masses. According to statistics from the Tianjin, Tang County, and Tong County special districts in Hebei Province, this amounted to 14.2 million jin (including the provincial government). Yanggu and Wuzhi counties in Pingyuan Province distributed 160,000 jin. At the same time, in order to increase wheat yield, a large number of improved wheat varieties were promoted, with approximately 2 million jin in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces. In flood-stricken areas, the leadership especially focused on draining and reclaiming land, proposing "Drain a piece, plant a piece." According to statistics from 32 counties in the Tianjin, Cang County, Tong County, and Baoding special districts in Hebei Province, 21.3 million mu of land had been drained, accounting for 80% of the flooded area. The Boai Fourth District of Pingyuan Province drained and reclaimed 5,500 mu of land, most of which had been sown. However, in the Tangshan and Tianjin special districts of Hebei, some of the sown wheat was again flooded. For example, 5,610 mu in three districts of Ji County and 8,751 mu in Xianghe were flooded. The masses are currently being mobilized to salvage or replant. In order to prevent wheat diseases and insect pests, wheat seed soaking was promoted in parts of Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shanxi provinces. Cadres in many areas personally conducted experiments and guided the masses to visit and learn, which was very effective. For example, in the Fifth District of Wan County, Hebei Province, 70% of households soaked their seeds. According to a survey of five villages in Dongyuan, Mancheng, 93 out of 212 households soaked their seeds, accounting for about 45%. During wheat sowing, the Pingyuan Provincial Government sold a total of 30,000 jin of red arsenic and "666" pesticides, and Xiangyuan County in Shanxi Province, in addition to using 1,000 jin of liquor to mix with the seeds, the county cooperative also sold 850 jin of red arsenic, solving some of the difficulties faced by the masses.

    Due to the abundant rain and wet soil this autumn, the general wheat planting area may be larger than in previous years. However, in cotton-producing areas, in order to expand cotton fields, the slogan "Three no-plantings for wheat (no planting without rain, no planting without fertilizer, no planting if it's late)" was put forward to appropriately resolve the contradiction between retaining cotton fields and planting wheat.

    Characteristics of the "Three Autumns" Campaign

    I. Leaders at all levels generally paid close attention to the "Three Autumns" work. After the North China Bureau and the North China People's Government issued instructions on the "Three Autumns" campaign, the special districts and counties successively held expanded cadre meetings to convey and mobilize, and make specific arrangements. In addition to the necessary cadres staying in the organs to persist in their work, a large number of cadres were drawn to go to the countryside to inspect, supervise, and guide, and to grasp the important links of the "Three Autumns" campaign and put forward calls in a timely manner, creating a mass movement. For example, the Chahar Provincial Government sent more than 380 cadres to Chabei, Chanan, and Yanbei twice, and technical cadres from various farms also went to the countryside to guide the masses in seed selection. In Hebei Province, the Tang County and Tong County special districts alone sent 1,700 cadres and students. Technical promotion teams in Shanxi and Pingyuan also went to the countryside to guide the masses in seed selection and soaking.

    II. The masses' production enthusiasm was high, and most women and children also participated in the "Three Autumns" campaign. Due to the stable environment, the cessation of war service, and the implementation of production policies, the masses' production enthusiasm was generally high. The most obvious manifestation was the general increase in wheat sowing fertilizer application and plowing frequency. For example, in most areas of Shanxi and Hebei, fertilizer application increased by 20% compared to last year. In Changzhi County, it reached 62 dan per mu, and in An'guo and Gaoyi, it reached 5 carts per mu in half of the villages. In Shanxi Province, 50% of the wheat-retained land was plowed and harrowed three times. In Jinzhong, where there was a shortage of animal power, most of the land was also plowed twice. In Xinxiang and Xiuwu counties in Pingyuan Province, 150,000 mu of land had been plowed twice. In general areas, except for the flood-stricken areas where it was impossible to plow, the stubble wheat land was generally plowed once. The phenomenon of sowing wheat without plowing, which was common in previous years, was no longer common. In terms of labor and animal power organization, most of the work was done by small temporary work exchange groups of two or three households or three or four households, and especially by family-based groups with all family members participating. This form, where people helped each other when there was work and disbanded when there was no work, not only solved the difficulties of labor and animal power, but also made the masses feel free and happy, greatly promoting the effectiveness of labor mutual assistance. In the autumn harvest, women's participation in production generally reached 70% in areas where it was customary, and 50% in semi-old areas. Substitute farming was also given attention at all levels and was constantly being improved.

    III. The combination of agricultural technology promotion and administrative leadership played a great role. In many areas, training courses or cadre meetings were held before the autumn harvest to learn seed selection and soaking techniques. In Wu'an and Handan counties in Hebei Province, a campaign to inspect and compete in good crops was launched among the masses. When the masses met while eating, working, going to market, or going to stores, they discussed whose crops were good or bad and the reasons, which made the masses deeply aware of the importance of production technology and intensive cultivation. This was very good.

    Future Opinions:

    I. Although autumn plowing has achieved considerable results in various places, given the cessation of war service and the abundant rain and wet soil this year, it is entirely possible to universally carry out autumn plowing throughout the region in order to prevent the occurrence of pests next year. Therefore, the call of "The ground doesn't freeze, the plow doesn't stop" should be implemented, and the importance of "One family doesn't plow in the autumn, a thousand families suffer from pests!" and "A good autumn plowing this year, a good harvest next year" should be repeatedly explained to the masses in order to vigorously organize the masses' labor and animal power to invest in the autumn plowing campaign.

    II. Vigorously develop winter production. On the one hand, preparations should be made for next year's agricultural production, such as collecting fertilizer and preparing for water conservancy projects, and repairing farm tools and waterwheels. On the other hand, the masses should be organized to develop sideline production, especially sideline production for disaster-stricken areas and disaster victims, which should be better organized and led.

    III. Summarize the year's production, elect labor models, and hold production exhibitions. In the past year, many labor heroes, production models, production experts, and model workers have emerged on the front line of agricultural production in various places. They have made their greatest efforts in the struggle against disasters and in ensuring increased production through intensive cultivation, and have created many heroic feats that deserve to be commended and learned from. Therefore, after the autumn harvest, the achievements, experiences, and lessons of the past year's work should be carefully summarized. Labor model meetings and production exhibitions should be held at the special district and county levels to encourage the masses' production enthusiasm and lay a better foundation for next year's large-scale production.

　　华北区的三秋运动
    华北人民政府农业部
    一般情况
    一、护秋：为确切保护农民一年辛勤劳动果实，各省于秋收前即组织群众，整顿民兵，开展群众性的护秋运动。各村普遍组织护秋委员会，订立护秋公约，组成民兵护秋小队，联防巡逻，并管制烟鬼、二流子白天生产，晚上集中睡觉，改变了过去雇用烟民二流子的旧习。河北沙河县提出“人人有秋，人人护秋！”以发动群众的力量，镇压了少数特务匪徒及不法分子的破坏活动，因而各地秋收秩序一般均属良好，新区偷盗现象亦较往年大为减少。但在各别地区，由于领导上未及时注意，致有些不事生产的懒汉及特务匪徒破坏分子借机偷盗破坏。也有地方对护秋方针不明确，因而对拾庄稼和小偷亦采取单纯惩罚办法，河北隆尧县政府，甚至错误地发布禁止拾秋的布告。
    其次是防止霜害，在山西晋东南地区各县普遍设防霜台，只和顺五个区即达五千四百五十五个，打柴四万三千余担，对防霜曾起很大作用。
    二、秋收选种：八月底九月初各地开始秋收，至九月八日全区秋收工作全面展开，至十月中旬大体结束，粮食大部入仓，只山药、花生尚未收完，棉花已摘过四、五次。
    今年秋收中特别重视了选种（以前很少有领导的进行），通过了村干部、共产党员、积极分子及老农座谈会进行宣传解释，或组织参观，进行示范，因之在选种有基础的地区，均得到了全面的开展；无基础的地区，也有了基点的建立，给明年打下基础。如察哈尔把田间选种，当为秋季生产中的三大工作之一，故该省选种成绩最大。仅察北、雁北两专区，即选出小麦、莜麦、山药等种子达二万五千六百五十九石，察南选种户达百分之七十左右。其他如河北省肃宁、行唐等十个县十六个区五十六个村统计，已选种二十八万二千一百十八斤，满城、定县有的村庄，有百分之八十参加了田间选种。
    三、秋耕种麦：各省对于秋耕，均要求普遍进行，提出“一家不秋耕，千家受虫害！”“今年秋耕好，明年好收成！”“地不冻，犁不停！”的口号。在群众中起了很大的推动作用。察绥两省今年已进行的秋耕地已达百分之五十八以上，估计可达百分之八十。河北、平原及山西改茬麦地，在紧张的“随熟随割，随耕随种”号召下，种麦工作亦于十月中旬大体结束，麦苗大部出土，现正全力进行秋耕中。在种麦中为解决群众麦种困难，领导上一面发动群众互助互借，一面由政府发放麦种，计河北省发放一千七百万斤，平原省六百万斤；不少专县并由地方粮拿出麦子，贷换给群众，河北省据天津、唐县、通县三个专区统计，即达一千四百二十万斤（省府在内）。平原省阳谷、武陟两县达十六万斤。同时为了提高小麦产量，大量推广优良麦种，河北、平原两省约计二百万斤。在水灾区领导上特别抓紧了排水脱地，提出“脱一块，种一块”。据河北天津、沧县、通县、保定四个专区三十二个县统计，已脱出地二千一百三十万亩，占被淹地面积的百分之八十。平原博爱四区排水脱地五千五百亩，已大部下种，但在河北唐山、天津专区，种麦后，又被水淹没一部分。如蓟县三个区淹没五千六百十亩，香河八千七百五十一亩。现正动员群众抢救或重种中。为了防止小麦病虫害，在河北、平原、山西部分地区提倡小麦浸种，许多地区干部亲自试验，引导群众参观，收效很大。如河北完县五区有的村浸种户达百分之七十。满城东原等五村之调查，二百一十二户浸种的有九十三户，约达百分之四十五。平原省省府在种麦时贷售红砷、“六六六”等农药共三万斤，山西襄垣除用酒千斤拌种外，县合作社并贷售红砷八百五十斤，解决群众一部分困难。
    由于今秋雨多地湿，一般麦田面积可能较往年为多，但在产棉区为扩大棉田，提出小麦三不种（没雨水不种，没粪不种，晚了不种）的口号，以适当解决留棉田和种麦的矛盾。
    三秋运动的特点
    一、各级领导上，对三秋工作普遍抓的很紧。华北局、华北人民政府三秋运动指示发出后，各专县均先后召开扩大干部会议传达动员，具体布置。除必要干部在机关坚持工作外，抽出大批干部下乡，检查督促指导，并掌握三秋运动的重要环节及时提出号召，造成群众运动。如察省省府两次派赴察北、察南、雁北干部达三百八十余人，各农场技术干部也下乡指导群众选种。河北省仅唐县、通县两专区就派干部、学生一千七百人。山西、平原技术推广队同时下乡指导群众选种浸种。
    二、群众生产情绪高涨，大部妇女儿童也参加了三秋运动。由于环境安定，战勤停止及生产政策的贯彻，群众生产情绪普遍高涨。最明显的是种麦施肥及犁地遍数普遍增加。如山西、河北大部地区施肥较去年增加二成，长治县每亩达六十二担，安国、高邑半数村庄每亩达五车。山西全省留麦地耕耙三次者占百分之五十。晋中畜力缺乏，亦大部犁过二遍。平原省新乡、修武两县十五万亩土地均已犁过两遍。一般地区改茬麦地，除水灾区没法下犁外，都普遍犁一遍，往年不犁即种麦的现象已不多见。在劳畜力组织上多系三两户或三四户的小型临时拨工组，尤以全家男女老少齐下手的家庭班更较普遍。这种有活就互助，没活就拆伙的形式，既能解决劳畜力的困难，群众又感到自由愉快，大大发挥劳动互助的效能。在秋收中妇女参加生产有习惯地区一般达百分之七十，半老区亦达百分之五十。代耕工作也引起各级注意，并在不断改进中。
    三、农业技术推广和行政领导相结合，起了很大作用。有不少地区秋收以前召开训练班或干部会议，学习选种、浸种技术。河北省武安、邯郸等县，在群众中并展开检查比赛庄稼运动，群众在吃饭、作活、赶集、上店时，见面即讨论谁的庄稼好坏及其原因，使群众深切体验到生产技术和精耕细作的重要，这是很好的。
    今后意见：
    一、各地秋耕已有不少成绩，但在今年战勤停止、雨多地湿的情况下，为防止明年虫害的发生，全区要求普遍秋耕，是完全可以办到的。因此应贯彻“地不冻，犁不停”的号召，向群众反复解释“一家不秋耕，千家受虫害！”“今年秋耕好，明年好收成”的重要，以大力组织群众的劳力畜力投入秋耕运动中。
    二、大力开展冬季生产，一面要为明年农业生产作好准备工作，如集肥、兴修水利工程的准备，修农具、水车等；一面要组织群众开展副业生产，特别是灾区灾民的副业生产，应更好的组织领导。
    三、总结全年生产选举劳模，召开生产展览会。各地在一年来农业生产的战线上，涌现了不少劳动英雄、生产模范、生产能手、模范工作者，他们在向灾害斗争中，在精耕细作保证增产上，曾尽了最大的努力，创造了许多英雄的伟迹，值得表扬、学习。因此秋收结束后，应认真的总结一年来的工作的成绩、经验、教训，以专县为单位，召开劳模会、生产展览会，借以鼓励群众的生产热情，为明年大生产打下更好的基础。
