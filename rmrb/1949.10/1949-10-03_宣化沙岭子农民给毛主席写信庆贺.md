　　Xuanhua Shalingzi Peasants
   　Write to Chairman Mao to Celebrate
    [Zhangjiakou Telegraph] Upon hearing the news of the successful People's Political Consultative Conference and the election of Chairman Mao as Chairman of the Central People's Government, the peasants of Shalingzi, Xuanhua, Chahar Province, were all overjoyed and wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to express their utmost support. The full text of the letter is as follows:
    Respected Chairman Mao: We were so happy to hear that you were holding a meeting in Beijing these past few days to discuss important state affairs. For many years, we have been eagerly anticipating this. Today, the Central People's Government has been officially established. From now on, the common people can live in peace and happiness. We are so happy that we don't know how to express it to you. Anyway, we wholeheartedly support you! We support the Central People's Government. Last year, the Kuomintang reactionaries conscripted soldiers and seized grain in our area, causing the people to suffer and die! Young people dared not stay at home, and the crops were left in the fields, unable to be harvested. This year, our People's Liberation Army came, and the people went to the fields to harvest the crops, returning home late at night. The comrades of the People's Liberation Army also helped us with the harvest. It was truly like heaven and earth! In order to have a great harvest next year, we implemented seed selection in the fields this year. Our village has more than 5,200 mu of land in total, and almost all the crops have been cut down. More than 30 mu of land have also been plowed for autumn planting. This year's crops were not affected by major disasters, and each mu of land can yield two to three shi of grain (one shi is 130-140 jin). Chairman Mao, please rest assured! Now that we have peace, we will definitely cultivate the land well, produce more grain, and build our new China. Chairman Mao: You distributed houses and land to us, allowing us who suffered to stand up. Now you have established the Central People's Government to lead us to live a good life. We will never forget your great kindness, even for generations to come. Because of the distance, we cannot go to Beijing to visit you, so we write this letter to greet you and express the wishes of all the men, women, old, and young in our village. According to the old custom, we should kowtow and bow to you in the letter, but now we salute you. And wish you good health! Please don't work too hard and tire yourself out!

　　宣化沙岭子农民
   　给毛主席写信庆贺
    【张家口电】察南宣化沙岭子农民，听到人民政协成功，与毛主席当选中央人民政府主席的消息后，大家莫不欢欣鼓舞，并给毛主席写信表示万分拥护。该信全文如下：
    敬爱的毛主席：这几天您们在北京开会商量治国大事，我们听说后真是喜欢，多少年来我们扒着两眼直盼，今天中央人民政府正式成立了，这以后老百姓能过安生日子，乐的我们真不知道应该咋向你说好了。反正我们是实实在在的实心眼的拥护您！拥护中央人民政府。去年国民党反动派在我们这里抓兵抢粮，把老百姓活活遭害死！年青人谁也不敢在家呆，眼看着庄稼扔在地里不能收秋。今年咱们解放军来了，老百姓下地收庄稼天大黑了才回家；解放军同志还帮助我们收割，真是差天上地下去了。为的明年大生产多打粮食，我们今年实行了地里选种。我们村一共五千二百多亩地，庄稼差不多都割倒了，秋耕地也耕了三十多亩。今年的庄稼没受大灾害，一亩地能打两三石粮食（一石一百三四十斤）。毛主席，您放心吧！这以后太平年月了，我们一定要把地种好，多打粮食，建设咱们的新中国。毛主席：您给我们分了房，分了地，叫我们受苦人翻了身，这会又成立了中央人民政府领导我们过了好日子、您这大恩情，我们祖祖辈辈也忘不了，因为道远，我们不能下北京看望您，写这封信问候您，表示我们全村男女老少的心意。要是按老规矩，我们在信上该给您叩头，作揖，现在也给您敬个礼。并祝您身体健康！千万别工作过度，劳累着身体！
