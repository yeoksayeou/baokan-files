Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th: TASS, Sofia reported citing the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency: On October 1st, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Poptomov sent a note to the Yugoslav Chargé d'Affaires in Sofia, Izkovich, stating: The leaders of the Yugoslav government have made threatening statements against Bulgaria and put forward intolerable demands to seize Bulgarian territory. The Yugoslav government has also organized hostile and subversive activities against the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Bulgarian people, including espionage in Bulgaria, border provocations, persecution of Bulgarian citizens in Yugoslavia, etc. In view of the fact that the Yugoslav government has completely violated the Bulgarian-Yugoslav Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed in 1947, the Bulgarian government declares that it is no longer bound by the obligations under this treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th: Bucharest dispatch: Romanian Foreign Minister Pauk delivered a note to the Yugoslav Ambassador to Bucharest on the 1st, stating: In view of the Yugoslav government's long-term hostile activities against Romania, sending spies into Romania, border provocations, vile slanderous propaganda against Romania, and the conspiracies revealed in the trial of the Rajk treason case in Hungary, the Romanian government believes that it is no longer bound by the obligations under the Romanian-Yugoslav Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance signed in 1947, and believes that the responsibility for abolishing the treaty should be borne by the Yugoslav government.

　　保罗两国照会南政府
  　废除与南友好条约
    【新华社北京四日电】据塔斯社索非亚讯引保加利亚通讯社报道：十月一日，保加利亚外交部长波普托莫夫以照会一件致送南斯拉夫驻索非亚代理代办伊兹科维奇，照会声称：南斯拉夫政府领袖曾在其声明中对保加利亚进行威胁并提出夺取保国领土的不能容忍的要求。南斯拉夫政府并组织反对保加利亚人民共和国和保国人民的敌对与颠覆性活动，包括在保境进行间谍活动，在边境挑衅，迫害南境内保国公民等等。鉴于南斯拉夫政府已完全违犯了一九四七年所签订的保南友好合作互助条约，保加利亚政府声明今后不受由此一条约所承担的义务的约束。
    【新华社北京四日电】布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚外长波克于一日以照会一件递交南斯拉夫驻布加勒斯特大使，照会声称：鉴于南斯拉夫政府长期对罗马尼亚进行敌对活动，派遣间谍进入罗境，在边境挑衅，对罗马尼亚进行卑鄙的诽谤宣传，以及在匈牙利审判拉伊克叛国案中所揭穿的阴谋，罗马尼亚政府认为今后不再受由一九四七年签订的罗南友好互助条约而承担的义务的约束，并认为废除条约的责任应由南斯拉夫政府负担。
