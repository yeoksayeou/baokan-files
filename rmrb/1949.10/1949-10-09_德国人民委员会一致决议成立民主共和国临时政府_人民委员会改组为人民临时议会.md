Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 8th. TASS, Berlin, October 7th: The ninth session of the German People's Council opened on October 7th in Berlin, the capital of Germany. People's Council members, many guests from Berlin and the German states, and journalists from German and foreign newspapers and radio stations gathered at noon in the assembly hall of the German Economic Commission. The meeting was opened by Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the Presidium of the German People's Council.

The first item on the agenda was the German People's Council's discussion and adoption of the declaration of the National Front of Democratic Germany.

The second item on the agenda was speeches by representatives of various parties and democratic organizations participating in the People's Council on the German political situation.

The ninth session of the German People's Council unanimously passed the resolution "On the Establishment of a Provisional Parliament and the Organization of a Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic." The resolution declared: "The German People's Council, in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution of the German People's Republic passed by the People's Council on March 19, 1949, and approved by the German People's Congress on May 30, 1949, declares itself to be the Provisional People's Chamber." Representatives and guests stood up and celebrated this epoch-making resolution, marking the birth of the German Democratic Republic, with prolonged, storm-like cheers.

In addition, the ninth session of the People's Council also passed a telegram to the four foreign ministers and a notice to the speakers of the German state parliaments regarding the holding of representatives of the Second Chamber (Federal Chamber).

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 8th. TASS, Berlin, June 6th: The Presidium of the German People's Council and the Anti-Fascist Democratic Bloc held a joint meeting in Berlin on October 5th. A communiqué was issued after the meeting stating: "The Presidium of the German People's Council and the Anti-Fascist Democratic Bloc held a joint meeting, chaired by Pieck, and unanimously adopted the following resolution:

The separate West German state has already been established, occupation statutes have been implemented, and the dismantling of factories in violation of international law is underway. The conclusion of a peace treaty has been rejected, and the High Commissioners are even intervening in issues such as the devaluation of the mark and the signing of economic treaties on the exchange of goods between East and West Germany. All of this indicates that due to the dictatorial policies pursued by the Western countries, Germany has fallen into a serious national disaster. The German People's Council, elected by the Third German People's Congress on May 30th of this year, has a responsibility to reorganize itself into a provisional People's Parliament in accordance with the Constitution of the German Democratic Republic passed by the Third German People's Congress, and to establish a government of the German Democratic Republic in accordance with the Constitution, in order to safeguard the national interests of the German people through national self-help. Therefore, the Presidium of the German People's Council has scheduled a plenary meeting of the German People's Council to be held here at twelve noon on October 7th."

　　德国人民委员会一致决议成立民主共和国临时政府
    人民委员会改组为人民临时议会
    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社柏林七日电：十月七日，德国人民委员会第九次会议在德国首都柏林开幕。人民委员会委员、来自柏林及德国各州的许多来宾和德国及外国的报纸与电台的记者，于中午集合在德国经济委员会的大会堂里。会议由德国人民委员会主席团的主席皮克揭幕。
    第一项议程是德国人民委员会讨论和通过了民主德意志全国阵线的宣言。
    第二项议程是各党派、各民主团体参加人民委员会的代表就德国政治局势发表演说。
    德国人民委员会第九次会议一致通过“成立临时国会与组织德意志民主共和国临时政府”的决议。该决议宣称：“德国人民委员会根据一九四九年三月十九日由人民委员会通过的、并在一九四九年五月三十日由德国人民代表大会批准的德国人民共和国宪法的精神，宣布自身为人民临时议会。”代表们和来宾们都起立，用历时甚久象暴风雨般的欢呼来庆祝这个表明德国民主共和国的诞生的划时代的决议。
    此外，人民委员会第九次会议还通过了致四国外长的电文，并通过了致德国各州议会议长关于举行第二院（联邦院）的代表的通知。
    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社柏林六日讯：德国人民委员会主席团和反法西斯民主联盟十月五日在柏林举行联席会议。会后发表公报称：“德人民委员会主席团和反法西斯民主联盟在举行联席会议，以皮克任会议主席，一致通过下述决议。
    分立的西德国家等业已成立，占领法规业已施行，违犯国际法的拆卸工厂正在进行。缔结和约遭到拒绝，高级专员甚至对马克贬值和签订东西德间关于换货的经济条约等问题上，都一手包办，所有这一切，表示出由于西方国家所奉行的独裁政策，已使德国陷入严重的民族灾难中。今年五月三十日德国第三次人民代表大会选出的德国人民委员会，为了以民族自助来保障德国人民的民族利益，有责任遵照第三次德国人民代表大会所通过的德意志人民共和国宪法将本委员会改组为临时人民议会，并成立合乎宪法的德意志民主共和国政府。因此，德国人民委员会主席团定于十月七日正午十二时在此间召开德国人民委员会全体会议。”
