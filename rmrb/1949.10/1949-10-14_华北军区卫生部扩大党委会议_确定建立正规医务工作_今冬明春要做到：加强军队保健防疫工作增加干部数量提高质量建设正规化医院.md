　　Enlarged Party Committee Meeting of the Health Department of the North China Military Region
　　Determines the Establishment of Regular Medical Work
　　This Winter and Spring, Efforts Should Be Made to Strengthen Military Health and Epidemic Prevention Work, Increase the Number of Cadres, Improve Quality, and Build Regularized Hospitals

　　[Special Dispatch] On September 20th, the Logistics and Health Department of the North China Military Region convened an enlarged Party Committee meeting. A total of 37 people attended, including the Party Committee members and heads of the Beijing-Tianjin Army General Hospitals, North China Medical University, International Peace Hospital, Cadre Sanatorium, Rear Hospitals, and section chiefs of the headquarters. The meeting discussed the issue of regularizing the construction of hospitals in the People's Army. Comrade Ye Qingshan, Secretary of the Party Committee, first conveyed the Logistics Party Committee's resolution, stating: "To build a regularized national defense logistics work, support the front lines, overcome all irregular guerrilla methods and styles, establish a regular style, and transform wartime work into peacetime work." This is the general guideline for the work of the logistics departments this winter and spring proposed by the Logistics Party Committee. Our three major tasks and two items of work are proposed under this general guideline. The three major tasks are: First, to build the military's health and epidemic prevention work, strengthen health management and education work to improve the health of the troops and enhance combat effectiveness. Second, to strengthen cadre education, increase the number of cadres, improve quality, and unite and transform new medical and technical personnel to enhance work efficiency. Third, to build regularized hospitals and establish and improve regular hospital work systems. The two items of work are: First, in pharmaceutical work, to adjust the organization and formulate drug supply standards suitable for the new situation. Second, to sort out and formulate health work regulations and rules, and establish a cadre attendance system. The above three major tasks and two items of work are the guiding principles for the health administrative work of the health department this winter and spring. Subsequently, in group discussions, the focus was on how to gradually regularize hospitals on the existing basis. After repeated research and debate, a resolution was made. It was believed that with the victorious development of the war situation, we have taken over the Beijing-Tianjin Army General Hospitals, which are of considerable scale in terms of technology and equipment. In the past six months, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the efforts of all staff, we have basically implemented the resolutions of the previous two Party Committees and completed tasks such as education review, organizational adjustment, and democratic salary assessment. The rear hospitals, sanatoriums, Peace Hospital, etc., which had long been in a guerrilla environment and persisted in arduous work, have also gradually moved from rural areas to cities and expanded their construction to meet the needs of the new situation. Regarding the correct understanding of establishing hospital regularization, the resolution wrote: "The essence of hospital regularization is to take the interests of the sick and wounded as the premise, take the proletarian ideology as the foundation, and under the centralized leadership of the Party Committee, strengthen the unity, planning, organization, and discipline of work; clarify the system, define responsibilities, achieve specialized proficiency in medical treatment, harmony and unity, master and fully utilize the effectiveness of science, technology, and modern equipment to better serve the sick and wounded, ensure reduced mortality and disability, and improve the cure rate.

　　The resolution also pointed out the basic principles for establishing a regular system and changing work style: "It must be a system of personal responsibility under centralized leadership and collective mutual assistance." Delineate responsibilities, perform respective duties, operate regularly, and act according to regulations. All work should be done step by step, in an orderly manner, with both reasonable division of labor and organic coordination. Overcome the adverse phenomena of mutual constraints, each going its own way, carelessness, perfunctory work, and procrastination.

　　The resolution also pointed out that the realization of hospital regularization must rely on a strong political guarantee. Therefore, it is necessary to repeatedly and universally educate the essence, effectiveness, purpose, and requirements of regularization among Party members, non-Party members, and all workers, and to develop everyone's enthusiasm and creativity, so that everyone can give full play to their talents and things can be put to good use. Aim at the general direction of regular construction and carry out various different tasks. New and old personnel should learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, help each other, unite closely, and encourage progress. Party members should become the backbone of building a regular hospital.

　　Finally, the Party Committee called on: "All workers unite and strive to build a regular hospital for the People's Army!"

　　华北军区卫生部扩大党委会议
    确定建立正规医务工作
    今冬明春要做到：加强军队保健防疫工作增加干部数量提高质量建设正规化医院
    【本报特讯】九月二十日，华北军区后勤卫生部召开扩大党委会，到各党委及京津两陆军总院，华北医科大学，国际和平医院，干部疗养院，后方医院等单位院长政委及本部科长以上干部共三十七人，讨论人民军队医院正规化建设问题。首由党委书记叶青山同志传达后勤党委决议说：“建设正规化的国防后勤工作，支援前线，克服一切不正规的游击主义的方法与作风，建立正规的作风，转变战时工作为平时工作。”这是后勤党委提出的今冬明春后勤部门工作的总方针，我们的三大任务两项工作，就是在这个总方针下提出来的。三大任务：第一、建设本军保健防疫工作，加强卫生管理教育工作，以增进部队健康，提高战斗力。第二、加强干部教育，增加数量，提高质量，团结与改造新的医务技术人员，以增强工作效能。第三、建设正规化医院，建立与健全医院正规的工作制度。两项工作是：一、在药材工作上，要调整组织，拟定适合新情况的药材供给标准，二、整理并制订卫生工作规章、条例，建立干部考勤制度。以上三大任务两大工作，是卫生部门今冬明春的卫生行政工作方针。接着在分组讨论中，集中在如何使医院在现有基础上逐步的正规化。经过反复的研究、争论，最后做出决议。认为：随着战争形势的胜利发展，我们接管了在技术与装备上均具相当规模的京津两陆军总院，半年来，由于党的正确领导及全体工作人员的努力，已基本上执行了上两次党委的决议，完成了教育审查，组织调整，民主评薪等任务。而原长期处于游击环境，坚持艰巨工作的后方医院，疗养院，和平医院等，也都先后由农村向城市集中，逐步扩大建设，以适应新形势的需要。对建立医院正规化的正确认识问题，决议写道：“医院正规化的实质，是以伤病员利益为前提，以无产阶级思想为基础，在党委的集中领导下，加强工作的统一性、计划性、组织性和纪律性；明确制度，划清职责，达到医疗上专科熟练，和谐一致，掌握和充分发挥科学技术与近代化装备的效能，更好的为伤病员服务，保证减少死亡残废，提高治愈率。
    决议又指出了建立正规制度转变作风的基本原则：“必须是集中领导与集体互助下的个人负责制。”划清职责，各尽职守，操作正规，照章办事。一切工作作到按步就班，有条不紊，既要合理分工，又要有机的配合。克服互相牵制，各自为政，粗枝大叶，敷衍塞责，拖延疲塌等不良现象。
    决议并指出：实现医院正规化，必须依靠强有力的政治保证。因此，必须对正规化的实质、效能、目的和要求，反复普遍的在党内外和全体工休人员中进行教育，并发扬大家的积极性和创造性，使人尽其材，物尽其用，对准正规建设的总方针，展开各种不同的工作。新老人员要取长补短，互相帮助，紧密团结，鼓励进步。党员要成为建设正规医院的骨干。
    最后，党委号召：“全体工休人员团结起来，为建设人民军队的正规医院而奋斗。”
