　　Conference Miscellany
    ★Yesterday was a clear autumn day. At dawn, teams from factories, military units, and schools flocked to the Xiannongtan Stadium. The venue was solemn and magnificent. Hundreds of national flags and red flags were erected around the stands. A giant eight-foot portrait of Chairman Mao hung in the center of the rostrum. The east glowed red as the sun rose. The grand opening ceremony began.
    ★Thousands of performers and athletes entered the arena with neat steps. The parade circled the field for a full forty-five minutes. The procession was led by the national flag, the conference flag, and a giant portrait of Chairman Mao. Workers from the Shijingshan Power Plant and the Postal Bureau, and soldiers from the General Picket Team were at the very front, followed by teams from primary, middle, and universities. Many primary and middle school students wore red clothes and small red hats. "Red" was the universally acknowledged "conference color."
    ★Before their performance of "Liberation Flowers Bloom Everywhere," the affiliated primary school of the Normal University specially presented flowers to the conference. Two elementary school students (one boy and one girl) carried two bouquets of fresh flowers and stepped onto the rostrum. Mayor Nie personally accepted them and warmly shook hands with the two students. More than a dozen photographers captured this cordial scene.
    ★Dozens of red flags from North China University floated into the stadium like a red cloud, and the whole audience cheered. Behind the red flags, comrades from the North China University Cultural Troupe, dressed as young men and women farmers in bright colorful clothes, advanced joyfully, beating waist drums. This was a beautiful picture of young men and women in the new Chinese countryside after their liberation. The waist drums sounded with the sound of battle, beating out joy across the field. Soviet friends in the stands couldn't help but stand up and applaud enthusiastically.
    ★The bayonets of the General Picket Team gleamed among the student ranks. A student said to a classmate standing next to him: "Do you know, I feel very happy now. This time last year, we still had to face the bayonets of the Kuomintang army and rush forward to demonstrate. Now, we are standing together with the People's Liberation Army soldiers with fixed bayonets to participate in sports performances. We love their shining bayonets. We know that this is the power that defends us!"
    ★North China University's "Long Live the People's Republic of China" was a magnificent poem written on Chinese palace satin. Under the October sun, in the clear blue sky, the large red flag fluttered in the wind. War drums and cymbals beat out the sound of China's victory. Dozens of pairs of young men and women in colorful clothes danced and sang to celebrate the birth of the Republic. They sang, "Struggling hard for a hundred years, the people's hope is realized today," red and green colored silks flew all over the field; they sang, "Thanks to the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, the workers and peasants unite, there is a reason for victory," a large red star was displayed; they sang, "Imperialism must get out, the revolution must be carried out thoroughly," the formation became four boats, and young men and women sailed on the boats full of songs towards the road of happiness where the national flag of the new China stood.
    ★The armed cross-country race of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army was an outstanding program. The soldiers used an extremely short time to remove their full equipment, clothes, shoes and socks in sections during the 100-meter race, and they had to arrange and fold them perfectly. When running back, they put them on piece by piece, with quick and agile movements. The armed cross-country race is a race in full gear. Our soldiers once used this heroic posture to march more than 200 miles day and night, eliminating fleeing enemies.
    ★The "fire stick exercise" performed by Datong Middle School was lively and powerful, and could exercise the muscles of the whole body. However, because it was not an individual performance, it had rarely been seen in the past twenty years, but now it has reappeared. There are similar collective gymnastics in the Soviet film "Sports Panorama". Yesterday, many sports veterans at the conference specially praised the "fire stick exercise".
    ★Yesterday, there were a total of thirty-six performance programs, each of which was politically significant. Most of them revolved around celebrating the birth of the People's Republic of China, or symbolized the unity of the four friends led by the workers. Soviet friends in the guest seats enthusiastically applauded every wonderful program of ours, especially when the translator told them the content of the performance and the meaning of forming the words "Long Live the People's Republic of China" with human bodies.
    ★The various programs were arranged tightly and orderly, the time was well controlled, and the programs were connected one by one. Performances with a large number of people entered the venue through three doors respectively and ran out in the end, without wasting a minute. This experience had already been gained in the preliminary selection, so it is necessary to have a preliminary selection before the sports meeting.

　　大会杂记
    ★昨日秋高气爽，早晨天刚发亮，工厂、部队、学生的队伍即陆续涌向先农坛体育场。会场严肃而且壮丽，看台四周树起百数十面国旗和红旗，主席台中央挂着八尺高的毛主席巨像，东方泛红，太阳升起。大会开始举行庄严的开幕式。
    ★数千演员、运动员踏着整齐的步伐入场了。分列式绕场一周，整整走了四十五分钟。队伍由国旗，大会会旗和毛主席的巨像前导，石景山发电厂和邮政局的工人，纠察总队的战士在最前面，其次是大中小学的队伍。许多中小学男女学生们穿着红衣，戴着小红帽，每个单位都撑着红旗，“红”是全场公认的“会色”。
    ★师大附小在表演“解放花处处开”之前，特向大会献花。两个小学生（一男一女）捧着两束鲜花，登上主席台。聂市长亲手接过来，并和两个小学生热烈的握手，十几个摄影员都把这亲切的场面摄入了镜头。
    ★华北大学三十几面红旗如一片红云，飘进运动场来，全场齐声喝采。在红旗后面，华大文工团的同志们扮成穿了艳丽彩衣的青年男女农民，打着腰鼓，欢跃前进。这是新中国农村中青年男女翻身后的美丽图景。腰鼓响着战斗的声音，敲出了满场喜气，看台上的苏联朋友们禁不住站起身来，连连笑着用力鼓掌。
    ★纠察总队的枪剌在学生队伍中闪闪发光。一个学生向站在他旁边的同学说：“你知道吗，我现在心里感觉到十分幸福。去年今日，我们还要面对着国民党军队的枪刺，冲过去游行示威。现在，我们和上了刺刀的解放军站在一起参加体育表演了。我们爱他们的闪闪发亮的刺刀，我们知道这就是力量，捍卫着我们的力量！”
    ★华北大学的“万岁中华人民共和国”是写在中国宫缎上的富丽的诗篇。十月的太阳下，晴蓝的天空中，大红旗随风招展。战鼓和铙钹敲出了中国的胜利的声音。几十对彩衣的青年男女为庆祝共和国的诞生跳着唱着。他们唱着“艰苦奋斗一百年，人民的希望实现在今天”，红绿彩绸满场飞舞；他们唱着“感谢共产党和解放军，工农联合起，胜利有原因”，大红星扮出来了；他们唱着“帝国主义要滚出，革命进行要彻底”，队伍扮成了四个船形，青年男女们在满载着歌声的船上向矗立着新中国国旗的幸福的路上摇去。
    ★人民解放军某团战士着装及武装竞走是一个突出的节目。战士们用极短的时间，在跑百米的途中，分成若干段卸下全副武装及衣服鞋袜，而且要完全摆正叠好，回跑时再一件件穿好戴好，动作迅速敏捷。武装竞走是全副武装的赛跑，我们的战士们曾经用这种英勇姿态，一昼夜行军二百多里，消灭了逃窜的敌人。
    ★大同中学表演的“火棒操”活泼有力，能够锻炼全身的肌肉。但因为不是个人的表演，近二十年来很少看到，现在出现了。苏联影片体育大观上也有类似的集体体操，昨天大会上许多体育名宿都特别赞扬“火棒操”。
    ★昨天共有三十六个表演节目，每一项都富有政治意义，大都围绕着庆祝中华人民共和国的诞生，或象征以工人为领导的四个朋友的团结，来宾席上的苏联朋友们都热烈地为我们每一个精彩节目鼓掌，尤其是当翻译告诉他们表演的内容和用人体组成“中华人民共和国万岁”等字意的时候。
    ★各项节目排列紧凑而有秩序，时间掌握正确，一个个节目都衔接起来，人数多的表演由三个门分别入场，最后跑步出场，不浪费一分钟时间。这已经在预选中取得了经验，所以开体育大会之前先有预选是必要的。
