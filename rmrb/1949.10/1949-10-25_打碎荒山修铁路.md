　　Breaking荒 Mountains to Build Railroads
　　Xu Jisun
　　"Chisel, ding, chisel, ding," at the foot of the mountain, the chiseler raises the hammer, firmly holds the chisel, and strikes the stone again and again. The sound of the stone breaking is clear and crisp, and the echoes in the mountain combine with the original sound, forming a "labor song." There are more than a hundred chiselers, but not one of them speaks; they all silently exert themselves and work in silence.
　　From dawn, the chiselers walk out of the village in twos and threes, carrying hammers and chisels, some with dry tobacco pipes in their mouths. These chiselers are all peasants who have turned over a new leaf. After finishing their farm work, they take advantage of the slack season to help chisel stones. Among this group of chiselers, there are young and strong lads in their twenties and thirties, and children who are just developing in their teens, but only one old man is the most noticeable. He is dry and thin, with particularly deep wrinkles on his face; obviously, he is the weakest in this group. The mountain road is rugged and uneven, and he walks with a sway, panting as he goes uphill with great effort. When he encounters a mountain ditch, he reluctantly hands the hammer and chisel to others. Once across the ditch, he immediately grabs them back, holding them tightly, fearing that others will say he is old and useless.
　　Upon arriving at the work site, they put down their tools and begin to smash stones. The "ding, ding, ding, ding" labor music begins again. The sun rises higher and higher with the music, and the chiselers get hotter and hotter. Everyone takes off their short jackets, revealing their black, strong, and sturdy muscles, and continues to work. Only the old man does not take off his jacket, but as the weather gets hotter and hotter, he sweats more and more. Finally, the old man takes off his jacket. He looks like he has no flesh on his body, just a layer of skin covering bones. Such a person should have been lying in bed, enjoying his old age, but he is vigorously smashing stones, strike after strike.
　　At noon, the women from home come to deliver food, which is the time for rest. The women carry baskets, some with children in their arms, slowly climbing the hillside. The chiselers are all gathered in the shade of the trees to cool off and smoke. The food baskets are delivered, and when the lids are opened, there are golden, fragrant cornbread and pickles inside. After resting for half a day, they are all hungry, so they devour the food greedily.
　　Suddenly, they hear the old man shouting angrily:
　　"No! No! I refuse to go back; see what you can do to me!"
　　Standing next to the old man is a girl of seventeen or eighteen. Judging from her appearance, she is probably the old man's granddaughter. She advises the old man to go back and rest, but unexpectedly, she provokes a scolding. The old man continues:
　　"You are all confused! You only know that now we have land at home, and we have food and clothing, and we don't rely on me to come out and work. But have you ever thought about how to live a good life? If it hadn't been for liberation, we wouldn't even have enough to eat, let alone have land! We can't kick away the ladder after crossing the river. We have to follow the Communist Party and follow Chairman Mao to bring peace to the world. Besides, this time we are smashing stones and building railroads for ourselves. With railroads, it will be convenient to go anywhere, and the People's Liberation Army can also go and fight Old Chiang. Don't look at me being old; I know everything. If I were ten years younger, I would still join the army. This little bit of work is nothing..."
　　The granddaughter knows that once her grandfather starts talking, he will never stop, so she doesn't argue back. When the old man is tired from talking, he realizes he is hungry, eats some cornbread hastily, and then picks up his tools again to smash stones.
　　Chisel, ding, chisel, ding, brown, healthy arms and white stones form a pattern of labor, accompanied by the music of labor. This is the artistic work of the great People's Republic of China's peasants - not delaying farm work, using their own hands, breaking荒 mountains, and building railroads.

　　打碎荒山修铁路
    徐戟孙
    凿石丁丁，凿石丁丁，在山脚下，凿石者举起铁锤，拿牢凿子，一下一下的砸着石头。石头破裂的声音，又清又脆，山中的回声和原来的声音配起来，正是一曲“劳动音乐”。凿石的工人们有一百多个，却没有一个人开口，都只是默默地使劲，默默的工作。
    从天一亮起，凿石者便三三两两的从村里走出，扛着铁锤，拿着凿子，有的嘴里还叨着旱烟袋，这些凿石者都是翻身后的农民，把田里的庄稼忙完了，趁着农闲来帮助凿石头。这群凿石者中，有二三十岁年青力壮的小伙子，有十五六岁刚发身的小孩，但是其中只有一个老年人最惹人注意，他是又干又瘦，脸上皱纹特别深，很明显的，他是这一群中身体最弱的一个。山路是崎岖不平的，他一摇一摇地走着，遇着上坡，张着嘴，喘着气，很吃力的走上去，遇着山沟，很不愿意的把铁锤和凿子交给别人，一过山沟，马上就抢回去，紧紧地握着，生怕别人说他老了，不中用了。
    到了工作地，放下家伙，大家便开始砸石头，“丁丁丁丁，”的劳动音乐又开始了，太阳随着音乐越升越高，凿石者也越来越热，大家都把短挂给脱了，露出一身黑壮结实的肌肉来，继续工作下去。只有那个老年人没有脱，但是天气越来越热，汗也越出越多，老年人才把短挂脱下。看上去，他身上像一点肉也没有，仅仅是一层皮包着骨头，这样的人，早就该躺在床上养老，但他却精神抖擞地一下一下地砸石头。
    中午，家里的女人们来送饭来了，这是休息的时候。女人们提着篮子，有的手上还抱着小孩，慢慢地爬上山坡。凿石者这时都聚集在树荫下歇凉，抽抽烟。饭篮送来了，掀开盖子，里面是金黄喷香的窝窝头和咸菜，歇了半天，肚子都饿了，便狼吞虎咽似地吃起来。
    一会儿，忽然听见那老年人生气地大叫：
    “不行！不行！我偏不回去，看你把我怎么样？”
    老年人旁边站着一个十七八岁的姑娘，看模样，大概是老人的孙女了，她劝老人家回去歇歇，却不料反招来一顿大骂。老年人接着说下去：
    “你们全都糊涂！你们只知道现在家里有了地，有吃有穿，不靠我出来做活，可是，你们也不想想怎么才过好日子的？要不是解放了，咱们连吃都吃不上，还能有地吗？咱们不能过了河就拆桥，咱们得跟上共产党，跟上毛主席把天下弄太平。再说，这回砸石头，修铁路，还不是为的咱们自己。有了铁路，到哪儿去都方便，解放军也可以去打老蒋了。你们别看我老，我可是什么都知道，我要是倒退十年，我还要参军呢，现在这点活，真算不了什么……”
    孙女知道爷爷一开话匣子就说个没完，也不回嘴，老人儿说累了，才觉出肚子饿了，胡乱地吃了点窝头，就又拿起工具来砸石头。
    凿石丁丁，凿石丁丁，褐色健康的手臂和白色的石块，组成了劳动的图案，配合着劳动的音乐，这就是伟大的中华人民共和国农民的艺术作品——不耽误农事，用自己的双手，打碎荒山，建设铁路。
