Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, October 6th: The Zhejiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army eliminated over 20,000 bandits in the bandit suppression operations during the four months from May to August. After the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River and advanced south, liberating all the vast areas of mainland Zhejiang, the Kuomintang remnant bandits implemented a strategy of decentralized hiding, attempting to continue to create chaos. More than a hundred gangs of bandits, large and small, appeared successively on both sides of the Qiantang River, the Fuchun River, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and in the mountainous areas. In May and June, while the People's Government was concentrating its efforts on taking over the cities, the hidden bandits and armed agents colluded with rural feudal despots, gathering hooligans, local bullies, and scattered soldiers to form large gangs of bandits to attack transportation lines and assassinate our personnel. At the beginning of July, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a three-month work plan for July, August, and September, stipulating that the central task in rural areas was to eliminate bandits and establish revolutionary order. The military region then made unified deployments to carry out province-wide bandit suppression, forming four bandit suppression district commands. At the same time, more than 7,000 cadres and soldiers were transferred to organize work teams to go to the countryside to mobilize the peasant masses and assist local party and government departments in carrying out rural work, while also establishing local armed forces. With the combination of active military pursuit and political offensives, the province's bandit suppression struggle had achieved great success by September, and the struggle situation had greatly changed. The large gangs of bandits in Jiangshan and Changshan areas of the third sub-district of western Zhejiang, where the bandit situation was originally more serious, have been wiped out or dispersed. In the fifth sub-district of eastern Zhejiang, in the eight counties including Wenzhou and Rui'an, except for a small number of bandits in Yuhuan and Qingtian along the coast, the large gangs of bandits have also been eliminated. In other areas, such as Tonglu and Jiande in the fourth and ninth sub-districts of western Zhejiang, and Wenling and Huangyan in the fifth and sixth sub-districts of southern Zhejiang, the large gangs of bandits have all been defeated and dispersed and are being pursued. In the process of suppression, because the bandit suppression troops simultaneously carried out the tasks of work teams and implemented the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China's bandit suppression policy of "combining military suppression, political disintegration, and mobilizing armed masses," they were able to organize the peasants to actively arm themselves to cooperate in bandit suppression. According to statistics from May to August, a total of 159 gangs of bandits were wiped out, 1,436 bandits (including bandit battalion commanders and below) were killed, 12,789 bandits (including bandit battalion commanders and below) were captured, and 10,137 were won over to surrender, for a total of 24,362 bandits eliminated. Seized were 24 mortars, 18 sixty-millimeter guns, 559 light and heavy machine guns, over 1,000 long and short guns, over 690,000 rounds of various bullets, over 15,000 artillery shells, 12 radio stations, and many other materials. In order to continue to deepen bandit suppression, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Zhejiang Military Region jointly issued instructions in mid-September on thoroughly completing the bandit suppression task in the Zhejiang area, instructing party committees at all levels to strengthen unified leadership over the bandit suppression work, highly develop the initiative, persistence, and vigilance of military suppression, further broadly launch political offensives and mobilize the masses, and organize mass armed forces. Resolutely strive to eliminate organized bandits and special agent armed forces in the province within about a year.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 6th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, which was suppressing the remnant bandits in the Dabie Mountains, successively captured alive the Dabie Mountain bandit leader, the pseudo-Hubei-Henan-Anhui People's Self-Defense Army Commander-in-Chief Wang Xian, the first Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Commander of the Lihuang Detachment and Lihuang County Chief Yuan Chengying, the second Deputy Commander and Chief of Staff Fan Xun, the Chief of the Staff Office Ma Junci, as well as staff officers, radio operators, and code clerks, totaling more than ten people, in the Lion's Mouth cave on Maoding Mountain, sixty li southwest of Jinjiazhai, and nearby areas on September 30th. Prior to this, the Liberation Army had captured six bandits, including Deputy Battalion Commander Zhang Jiwu and Feng Chunbo, on September 27th. Bandit leader Wang Xian was originally a Kuomintang bandit army major general division commander of the Ninety-second Division. After the liberation of Wuhan, he was ordered by the bandit Ministry of National Defense and Bai Chongxi to lead three remnant bandit regiments, totaling more than 7,000 people, to sneak into the Dabie Mountains, using Jinjiazhai as their lair, to collude with bandit gangs and special agents to harass the area. After the liberation of the bandit lair Jinjiazhai on September 7th, the Wang bandits and others fled into the deep mountains and were eventually captured alive by the Liberation Army. The leaders of a certain unit have awarded collective merit to a certain company that contributed to the capture of the bandit leader.
