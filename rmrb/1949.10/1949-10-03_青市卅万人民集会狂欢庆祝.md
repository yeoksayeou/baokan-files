　　【Our Correspondent in Qingdao, 2nd Dispatch】Today, over 300,000 citizens of Qingdao gathered to celebrate the birth of the People's Republic of China, the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in Qingdao, and to participate in a grand parade for the International Day of Struggle for Peace. Starting at 6:00 AM, various organizations, groups, and citizens gathered from Zhongshan Road, Taiping Road, and Laiyang Road along the Huanghai (Yellow Sea) coast towards the Huiquan Racecourse; even as the meeting was about to end, the magnificent procession continued to flow like a tide towards the racecourse. Today, Qingdao enjoyed clear skies and bright sunshine, with thousands of red flags waving, displaying its unprecedented beautiful posture. The people of Qingdao, who have lived under colonial rule for decades, today celebrated with unrestrained joy the birth of a New China that truly belongs to the people. Director Xiang Ming of the Military Control Commission and Mayor Yu Bao called on the citizens to wage a resolute struggle against the imperialist reactionaries for the consolidation of world peace and for the construction of a new Qingdao, until complete victory. The Chairman of the Qingdao Soviet Citizens Association, Leierqizhiji, was invited to speak, saying: The Chinese people must not forget Mao Zedong; we must develop the foundation of our Sino-Soviet friendship. He then shouted: Long live the great Chinese people! Long live the great people's leader Mao Zedong! On this day, Soviet expatriates in Qingdao also rejoiced in the birth of the New China.
    【Our Correspondent in Qingdao, 1st Dispatch】More than 800,000 citizens of Qingdao are today immersed in celebration. The news of the election of the people's leader Mao Zedong as Chairman of the People's Government and the list of Vice Chairmen and members of the People's Government are spreading. Yangko dance teams and propaganda trucks attracted citizens. Because of the rush to make national flags, the red cloth in the cloth shops was almost completely bought out. People held high portraits of their leader Chairman Mao and passed through Zhongshan Road, Guangxi Road, and other streets. Slogans, gongs, and singing drowned out even the roar of the sea.
