　　Soviet Youth Workers' Competition Increases Production to Celebrate the Great October Revolution Festival
　　5,000 Workers in Kirov District Have Completed Their Five-Year Quota
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 24th】 TASS Moscow, October 23rd: Soviet youth are actively participating in the national socialist competition launched to celebrate the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution. In Moscow's enterprises, young people have made special promises to commemorate the upcoming festival.

　　Young people have achieved great results in the movement to complete the post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule. In the capital's Kirov district, 5,000 young workers have already completed their five-year quota, and 6,000 have completed their 1949 plan ahead of schedule. At the Stalin Automobile Factory, thousands of young workers have completed their five-year plan, and more than 3,000 young workers have completed their four-year quota. Many Moscow youths are commemorating the October Revolution Day with new labor achievements. Alexander Lavrukin, a young grinder working in an auto repair shop, has completed fourteen times his annual quota. Eight young Stakhanovite activists at the Moscow Tool Factory have each completed ten annual quotas.

　　About 20,000 young workers in Leningrad have their own personal records of saving metals, fuel, and electricity. The materials saved by young workers at the Skorokhod Shoe Factory alone are enough to make 300,000 pairs of shoes.

　　Soviet young miners have shown the brilliant model of labor heroes. In the coalfields of Voroshilovgrad Oblast, about 10,000 young miners have made special Stakhanovite pledges to commemorate the upcoming festival.

　　More than 20,000 workers from factories, workshops, construction sites, and sailors from the Black Sea merchant fleet in Odessa are making new achievements every day. In the port of Odessa, you won't find a young stevedore or machine operator who hasn't exceeded his quota. The port of Odessa completed its annual cargo handling plan in nine months and two days ahead of schedule, largely thanks to the youth. Since the beginning of the Five-Year Plan, more than 3,000 young workers in the city have completed five to ten times their annual quotas, and about 6,000 young men and women are producing beyond this year's plan.

　　苏联青年工人竞赛增产庆祝伟大十月革命节日
    基洛夫区五千工人已完成五年定额
    【新华社北京二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：苏联青年正积极参加为庆祝十月革命三十二周年所发起的全国性的社会主义竞赛。在莫斯科的企业中，青年们已做出了特别诺言，以纪念即将到来的节日。
    青年们在提早完成战后五年计划运动中已收得伟大成果。京城基洛夫区有五千青年工人已经完成了他们的五年定额，有六千人已经提早完成了一九四九年的计划。在斯大林汽车工厂，数以千计的青年工人们已经完成他们的五年计划，有三千多青年工人已完成了他们的四年定额。许多莫斯科青年在用新的劳动成就来纪念十月革命节。在汽车修理厂作工的年青磨工亚历山大·拉夫鲁金已经完成了他的每年定额的十四倍。莫斯科工具制造厂的八个年青的斯塔哈诺夫运动者每人已经完成了十个每年定额。
    约两万个列宁格勒的青年工人有他们自己个人的关于节省五金、燃料和电力数量的记录。仅斯考鲁霍德制鞋厂青年工人们所节省的材料，即可制三十万双鞋。
    苏维埃年青的矿工表现出劳动英雄的光辉的模范。在伏罗希洛夫格勒州的煤场中，约一万个青年矿工已为纪念即将到来的节日做出特别的斯塔哈诺夫式的保证。
    两万多名敖德萨的工厂、作坊、建筑场所的工人和黑海商船队的水手，每天均有新的成就。在敖德萨港不会发现一个没超过他的定额的青年装卸工人或者管理机器的工人。敖德萨港在九个月另两天之内提早完成了装卸货物的全年计划，大部分要归功于青年。自从五年计划开始以来，这个城的三千以上的青年工人，已经完成了他们每年定额的五倍至十倍，约有六千青年男女已在超过本年计划而进行生产了。
