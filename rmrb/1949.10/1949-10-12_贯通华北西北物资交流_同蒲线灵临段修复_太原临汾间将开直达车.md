　　Connecting North and Northwest China Material Exchange
    Tongpu Railway Ling-Lin Section Repaired
    Direct Trains to Run Between Taiyuan and Linfen

    [Our Dispatch] The Ling-Shi to Linfen section of the South Tongpu Railway was officially repaired on October 9th. Direct trains will soon run between Taiyuan and Linfen, a distance of over 270 kilometers. This is of great significance for military transportation between North and Northwest China, as well as for material exchange between southwestern Shanxi and other regions. Linfen is a distribution center for cotton, a specialty product of southern Shanxi. In addition to cotton, coal and wheat are also major exports on the South Tongpu Railway. This repair project was organized by the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, which assembled a repair team of 1,400 people. They repaired the railway from Lingshi southward at a rate of 2.5 to 3 kilometers per day. The terrain between Lingshi and Fujiatan is complex, with the Taihang Mountains on the left and the Fen River on the right. Eighty percent of the line consists of curves with radii of 100 to 200 meters, making the transportation of materials extremely difficult. In addition, continuous heavy rains in August made the repair work even more challenging. However, the workers had a high level of enthusiasm for production and worked from 7:00 AM until dark every day. Some workers who lived in the mountains suffered from diarrhea after drinking the muddy water of the Fen River, but they still persisted in their work. Finally, at 11:00 PM on October 9th, the repairs officially reached Linfen.

　　贯通华北西北物资交流
    同蒲线灵临段修复
    太原临汾间将开直达车
    【本报讯】南同蒲线灵石至临汾段于十月九日正式修复。太原至临汾间二百七十余公里即将开行直达车。对于华北与西北的军事运输及晋西南与其他地区的物资交流关系甚大。临汾是晋南特产棉花的集散地，除了棉花之外，煤和小麦也是南同蒲线的大宗输出品。此次修复工程由太原局负责组织一千四百人的抢修队，每天以二公里半至三公里的速度由灵石向南抢修。灵石到富家滩段，地形复杂，左靠太行山，右依汾河，百分之八十线路是一百到二百公尺半径的弯道，材料运输十分困难，加上八月间大雨连天，使抢修工程进行极为艰巨。但工人们生产热情很高，每天从早七点直做到天黑才收工。有些住在山上的工人们，因为喝了汾河的泥浆水闹肚子，也仍然坚持工作，终于在十月九日夜十一点钟正式修至临汾。
