　　For the Great Motherland and the People

    Personnel of the Former Kuomintang Reactionary Government's Embassies and Consulates in France

    Declare Their Break From the Kuomintang Bandit Gang

    Telegraph Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to Await Takeover

    Foreign Minister Zhou Replies with Welcome and Calls on All Puppet Embassy and Consulate Personnel to Follow Suit

    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 11th] Paris Dispatch: All staff members of the former Kuomintang reactionary government's embassy in France and the consulate general in Paris issued a declaration on the 10th, stating their break from the Kuomintang reactionary group, their support for the People's Republic of China, and that they would remain at their posts, safeguarding documents and public property, and await instructions from the Central People's Government for the takeover. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

    Declaration of Support for the People's Republic of China by All Staff Members of the Former Embassy in France and the Consulate General in Paris

    The People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government have been formally established amidst the jubilation of the people nationwide. Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor who long betrayed Sun Yat-sen, and the regime controlled by the Kuomintang reactionaries have lost all conditions for a lingering existence under the heroic and vigorous pursuit of the people's revolutionary armed forces. We, colleagues who have been serving in foreign affairs, express our warm congratulations and highest respect to the people of the new China and the great people's leader, Chairman Mao, with extreme excitement.

    The great Chinese people's revolution, led by the Chinese Communist Party through twenty-eight years of heroic struggle, is about to achieve complete victory. The military stage is nearing its end, and the work of nation-building has begun. Objective facts require us to recognize clearly that New Democracy is the only way to build a new China. That is to say, only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the representative of the broad working class and peasantry, uniting with all democratic strata of the country, and implementing the people's democratic dictatorship, can we rapidly and thoroughly complete China's social reform, economic construction, and cultural revival.

    For the construction of a new China, the Chinese people need not only domestic unity but also world peace. The Chinese people must unite with all peace-loving countries and peoples around the world to fight together, so that those who create war dare not act.

    We are determined to participate in the work of nation-building. We must first resolve to thoroughly eradicate all our ingrained feudal bureaucratic habits, foreign worship, and the deep-rooted evils of individualism, only then can we transform ourselves into the people and learn from the people how to serve the people. We solemnly declare our break with the reactionary government, each remaining at our original posts, protecting the interests of the people, safeguarding public property and documents, and awaiting the takeover and instructions of the People's Government. At the same time, we sincerely urge all colleagues in embassies and consulates to quickly rise up and respond to us in overthrowing the stubbornly unrepentant diehards, preventing them from misusing the name of Chinese diplomats to spread rumors in the United Nations and internationally, insult the Chinese people, provoke international disputes, and endanger world peace.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 11th] All staff members of the former Kuomintang reactionary government's embassy in France and the consulate general in Paris telegraphed to Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, on the 9th, declaring their break with the Kuomintang reactionary government. The submission reads as follows: "Xinhua News Agency forwards to Minister Zhou, concurrently Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Beijing: Colleagues have unanimously resolved: to declare a break with the reactionary government, each maintaining our positions to safeguard the interests of the people, safeguard public property and documents, and await instructions for takeover."

    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th] Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied yesterday to all staff members of the former Kuomintang government's embassy in France and the consulate general in Paris, saying: "To all staff members of the former Kuomintang government's embassy in France and the consulate general in Paris: Your telegram of the 9th has been received and is greatly gratifying. Your declaration of breaking away from the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group and accepting the leadership of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has also been received. I express a warm welcome to your patriotic action. All personnel of the former Kuomintang government's embassies and consulates and other staff members stationed in other countries should follow your example, break away from the reactionary camp, obey the Central Government of the great people's motherland, and perform meritorious service for the motherland and the people. All such meritorious personnel who break away from the reactionary camp will be employed according to their abilities by the Ministry, so that they can make contributions to the motherland. I hope you will unite as one, hold fast to your current positions, and be responsible for safeguarding public property and documents, pending the takeover by the Central People's Government. Zhou Enlai, October 10, 1949, in Beijing."

　　为伟大祖国与人民立功
    前国民党反动政府驻法使领馆人员
    宣告脱离国民党匪帮
    电呈周恩来外长听候接管
    周外长复电欢迎号召一切伪使领馆人员效法
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】巴黎讯：前国民党反动政府驻法大使馆暨驻巴黎总领事馆全体馆员于十日发表宣言，声明脱离国民党反动集团，拥护中华人民共和国，并各就工作岗位，保管文件公物，听候中央人民政府指示接管。宣言全文如下：
    前驻法大使馆暨巴黎总领事馆全体馆员拥护中华人民共和国宣言
    中华人民共和国和中央人民政府在全国人民欢腾鼓舞之下已正式成立。久已背叛了孙中山的卖国贼蒋介石和国民党反动派所把持的政权，在英勇的人民革命武装奋击追逐之下，已经失去了一切苟延残喘的条件。我们一向服务外交的同人们，在极度兴奋的情绪之下，向新中国全国人民和伟大的人民领袖毛主席表示热烈的贺忱和最崇高的敬意。
    中国人民大革命由中国共产党领导进行二十八年壮烈的斗争，快要取得完全的胜利。军事阶段快要结束，建国工作已经开始。客观的事实要我们认识清楚：新民主主义是建设新中国的唯一途径。就是说，只有在广大工农阶级的代表中国共产党领导之下，联合全国民主阶层，实行人民民主专政，才能够迅速并且彻底完成中国的社会改革、经济建设和文化复兴。
    为了建设新中国，中国人民不仅需要国内统一，并且需要世界和平。中国人民必须联合全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民共同奋斗，使制造战争者不敢动手。
    我们立志要参加建国工作，我们先要痛下决心，把我们浑身封建官僚的积习、洋迷和个人主义的劣根性彻底剔除净尽，然后才能够把自己改造成人民，向人民学习如何替人民服务。我们郑重宣布和反动政府脱离关系，各仍站在原有工作岗位，保护人民利益，保管公物文件，听候人民政府接管和指示。同时，我们热诚劝告全体使领同人，快起来响应我们打倒执迷不悟的死硬分子，制止他们盗用中国外交官的名义在联合国和国际间散布谣言，侮辱中国人民，挑拨国际是非，危害世界和平。
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】前国民党反动政府驻法大使馆暨驻巴黎总领事馆全体馆员于九日电呈中央人民政府外交部长周恩来，声明与国民党反动政府脱离关系。呈文如下：“新华社转北京外交部周兼部长：同人等一致议决：宣告与反动政府脱离关系，各在工作岗位维护人民利益，保管公物文件，听候指示接管。”
    【新华社北京十一日电】外交部周部长昨日电复巴黎前国民党政府驻法大使馆暨驻巴黎总领事馆全体馆员称：“巴黎前国民党政府驻法大使馆暨驻巴黎总领事馆全体馆员均鉴：九日电悉，甚为欣慰。你们脱离国民党反动残余集团接受中华人民共和国中央人民政府领导的宣言，亦已收到。我对于你们的这种爱国行动，表示热烈的欢迎。驻在其他国家的前国民党政府的一切使领馆人员与其他工作人员，均应效法你们的榜样，脱离反动阵营，服从伟大人民祖国的中央政府，为祖国与人民立功。所有这种脱离反动阵营的有功人员，本部均将量才录用，使能对于祖国有所贡献。希望你们团结一致，坚守现在工作岗位，负责保管公物文件，以待中央人民政府接管。周恩来一九四九年十月十日于北京。”
