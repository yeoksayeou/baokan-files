Fadeyev, Simonov
    Give Lectures to Over Ten Thousand Students in Beijing
    Receive Enthusiastic Welcome and Grand Gifts
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] Fadeyev, head of the Soviet Cultural, Artistic, and Scientific Workers Delegation, and Simonov, the deputy head, went to Peking University yesterday morning at ten o'clock to give lectures. The audience consisted of over ten thousand students from more than twenty universities and middle schools, including China University, Peking University, Jiaotong University, Fu Jen Catholic University, the Hui People's College, Pei Man Girls' School, and Yu Ying Middle School. As soon as Fadeyev and others got out of the car, they were enthusiastically lifted up by Peking University students who were welcoming them at the gate. Cheers and applause erupted, lasting for a long time.

    The lecture began after the solemn playing of the Chinese and Soviet national anthems. First, Tang Yongtong, Chairman of the Peking University School Board, delivered a welcome speech. He first represented Peking University in expressing a sincere and warm welcome to the great friendly cultural delegation. He said, "Peking University and other schools must shoulder their due responsibilities in the construction of the New Democratic culture. In this work, we sincerely wish to receive instructions and suggestions from the leaders of our friendly cultural circles."

    Fadeyev smiled and walked onto the stage amidst thunderous applause. When he returned the applause to the students, enthusiastic cheers erupted from the audience. Some students enthusiastically threw their clothes and hats into the sky, shouting, "Learn from the Soviet Union!" "Long live Stalin!" "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" His lecture was entitled "Soviet Cultural Construction." He began by saying, "On behalf of Soviet cultural workers, I extend fraternal greetings to you and congratulate you on the victory of the People's Republic of China." Then he pointed out the five characteristics of Soviet culture. He concluded by saying, "In another ten or twenty years, China will be completely renewed in culture. The victory of the people's revolution will make the Chinese people one of the most progressive nations in the world, showing the way for all mankind." Simonov's lecture was "Talking About Soviet Literature and Writers," introducing the status of Soviet writers in the state and society, and how they serve the people. Finally, he shouted in Mandarin, "Long live Mao Zedong!"

    Then, all the participating units sang "The East is Red" and "Unity is Strength," and presented flowers, flags, Peking University professors' dissertations from previous years, plaster statues of Peking Man, student movement photos, and other precious commemorative gifts to the international friends. Finally, everyone sang "The Internationale." When Fadeyev and other representatives came out, the students enthusiastically lifted Fadeyev up again and threw red and green paper flowers on him. After the meeting, they visited the Peking University Library and the "History of the Student Movement Since the May Fourth Movement Exhibition" displayed there.

    讲演在庄严的中、苏国歌后开始，首由北京大学校委会主任汤用彤致欢迎词，他首先代表北大，向伟大的友邦文化代表团，以至诚和热烈的心情表示欢迎。并说：“北京大学及其他学校，在建设新民主主义的文化工作中，要担负起应有的责任，在这个工作上，我们甚愿获得我们友邦文化界领袖的指示和建议。”
    法捷耶夫微笑着，在雷动的掌声中走上讲台，当他向同学们也报以鼓掌时，台下立刻爆发出狂热的欢呼，有的同学并热情地把衣服、帽子，抛向天空，狂喊：“向苏联学习！”“斯大林万岁！”“中苏友谊万岁！”他的讲题为“苏联文化建设”，他首先说：“我代表苏联文化工作者，向你们致兄弟的敬礼，并祝贺中华人民共和国的胜利。”接着他指出了苏联文化的五个特点。他结束时说：“再过十年二十年，中国在文化方面，将要焕然一新，人民革命的胜利，将使中国人民列入指示全人类道路的，世界最进步的民族之中。”西蒙诺夫的讲演是“谈苏联文学及作家”，介绍苏联作家在国家社会中的地位，及如何为人民服务。最后他用北京话高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”
    接着全体到场各单位，在高唱“东方红”、“团结就是力量”等歌声中，向国际友人献花、献旗、献北大教授历届论文、北京原人石膏像、学运照片及其他各种珍重的纪念礼物，最后全体齐唱“国际歌”。法捷耶夫等代表出场时，同学们热情迸发地又把法捷耶夫抬起，向他身上抛撒红绿纸花。会后他们参观了北大图书馆及其中陈列的“五、四以来学运史展”等。
