(1) Telegram to Marshal Stalin

Respected and Great Marshal Stalin:

The Beijing branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in the capital of the People's Republic of China was formally established today, following the establishment of the national headquarters. In a short period of preparation, our membership has exceeded 125,000, making us the largest mass organization in Beijing. This demonstrates the enthusiastic support of the people of Beijing for enhancing the friendly relations between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Because in our Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, we have experienced that the people and state of the socialist Soviet Union under your leadership are not only the closest friends of the Chinese people in the struggle against imperialism and domestic reactionaries, but also the best model for the Chinese people's future economic and cultural construction. We deeply realize that only by working closely with our Soviet friends and learning from the rich experience of the Soviet Union can we more quickly complete the tasks of the Chinese revolution and construction. We are determined to work hard under the leadership of the national headquarters of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to further consolidate and develop the friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Our conference unanimously decided to extend to you and the great Soviet people under your leadership our warmest and most respectful greetings!

The Inaugural Meeting of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, October 9th

Respected Chairman Mao:

Following the establishment of the national headquarters of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, our Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was inaugurated today. In a short period of preparation, we have developed 125,000 members, which shows the enthusiastic support of the people of Beijing for enhancing the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union. We know that this is entirely due to your leadership in the Chinese people's revolution, which has achieved a basic victory, removed all obstacles, and paved a broad path for the development of friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. In the future, we will work hard under your wise guidance and under the leadership of the national headquarters of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to further consolidate and develop the friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union.
