(Baoding Dispatch) The autumn harvest in Hebei Province is nearing completion, and farmers everywhere are actively ploughing and concentrating their efforts on sowing wheat. Since late August, after a month of concentrated effort, spring corn, millet, foxtail millet, and sorghum have all been harvested and stored in granaries; the late autumn crops are nearing completion; and cotton has been picked once or twice. This year's autumn season, thanks to the strong leadership of Party committees and people's governments at all levels, and the indomitable spirit of the broad masses of farmers in overcoming various disasters such as drought, wind, hail, floods, and pests, has resulted in a bumper harvest in most areas. The Dingxian Special District's harvest exceeded last year's, with an average yield of two shi (石) of millet per mu (亩), and an average of more than one shi of sorghum per mu. Hejian County averaged an 80% harvest. In the four special districts of Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, and Hengshui, the cotton harvest was relatively good, generally yielding about 100 jin (斤) of seed cotton per mu, with better yields reaching 150 jin. A characteristic of this year's autumn harvest is that the leadership proactively launched an autumn protection movement, resulting in good order during the harvest. Before the autumn harvest, local militias established joint autumn protection defenses, effectively suppressing the sabotage activities of a small number of special agents, bandits, and lawbreakers. In Dingxian Special District, under the protection of Party members and cadres combined with the militia mobilizing the masses, 80% of the villages did not experience any autumn theft incidents. Another characteristic is that the masses have begun to pay attention to seed selection. In fifteen villages in the third district of Mancheng, a thousand households have already selected seeds. Thirdly, due to the reduction in corvée labor compared to previous years during this year's autumn harvest, most areas combined harvesting with autumn ploughing. This ensures the timely sowing of autumn wheat and lays the foundation for drought and disaster resistance next year. Currently, the masses in various places are working hard to sow wheat. Preparations in various places are very thorough: Fertilizer preparation in non-disaster areas exceeds previous years. In 21 villages in the seventh district of Anguo, 210,000 cartloads of fertilizer were accumulated in August alone. This year, more than five carts of manure are applied per mu of wheat. In addition to a large amount of accumulated manure, various places are also purchasing a lot of refined fertilizer. Oil mills and bone meal factories in various cities are also producing large quantities of fertilizer to supply the needs of farmers. The Baoji Oil Pressing Factory in Baoding alone is rushing to produce 500,000 jin of bean cake. Public-owned stores in various places are also cooperating with supply and marketing cooperatives to regulate fertilizer and arsenic. The Nangong Office and Nangong Branch of the People's Bank of Xingtai Special District purchased 4.35 million jin of Northeast bean cake and 1,500 jin of arsenic from Tianjin at the end of August, which were sold to farmers at 10% below the market price. Seed loans were also provided to farmers who could not afford to plant wheat. According to statistics from the supply and marketing cooperatives of ten counties including Anguo and Linzhang, more than 550,000 jin of wheat seeds and a large amount of fertilizer were loaned out, solving the main difficulties for farmers in planting wheat. In disaster areas, under the full efforts of the Party, government, army and people, water was drained and land reclaimed in preparation for rushing to plant. According to statistics from 32 counties, a total of 11,295,500 mu of land has been drained and reclaimed. According to the decision of the North China People's Government, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative transferred 15 million jin of wheat seeds, distributed them to disaster areas, and supplied them to farmers through three methods: loans, sales, and exchanges. The masses were mobilized to borrow and exchange among themselves. The wheat sowing in various places is about to enter a tense stage.

　　河北全省秋收将毕
  　正突击秋耕种麦
    【保定电】河北全省秋收将毕，各地农民正积极秋耕、突击种麦。自八月下旬开始，经月来的突击，春棒子、黍稷、谷子、高粱，已全部收完入仓；晚庄稼收割将完；棉花都摘过一遍到两遍。今年秋景，由于广大农民在各级党委和人民政府的坚强领导下，以百倍的斗争毅力，战胜了旱、风、雹、洪水、病虫等各种灾害，致大部地区获得丰收。定县专区收成超过去年，谷子平均每亩产两市石，高粱每亩平均一石以上。河间全县平均八成年景。邯郸、邢台、石家庄、衡水四个专区，棉花收成较好，一般每亩能摘籽棉百斤左右，较好的达一百五十斤。今年秋收的特点是领导上主动的开展了护秋运动，使秋收秩序良好。秋收前，各地民兵即建立了护秋联防，有力的镇压了少数特务匪徒及不法分子的破坏活动。定县专区在党员干部结合民兵发动群众的保护下，百分之八十的村庄没发生偷秋事件。另一特点是群众已开始注意选种。满城三区十五个村，已有千户选了种。第三是今年秋收中，由于勤务较往年减少，各地大部结合收割进行了秋耕。因而保证了按时种秋麦，和打下了明年抗旱抗灾的基础。目前各地群众正紧张的突击种麦，各地准备工作非常充分：非灾区肥料的准备超过以往几年。安国七区二十一村，只八月份一月即积肥达二十一万车，今年种麦每亩施粪五车以上。各地除大量积肥外，并购买很多细肥，各城市的油坊骨粉厂亦大量制造肥料，以供应农民需要，单只保定保记榨油厂，即赶制豆饼五十万斤。各地公营商店亦配合供销社调剂肥料、信石。人民银行邢台专区南宫办事处及南宫支行，八月底由津购到东北豆饼四百三十五万斤，信石一千五百斤，均低于市价百分之十售于农民。并有重点的对无力种麦的农民进行了贷种，据安国、临漳等十个县供销社的统计，贷出麦种五十五万余斤，和大批肥料，解决了农民种麦主要困难。灾区在党政军民全力奋斗下，进行了排水脱地，准备抢种。据三十二个县的统计，已排水脱地共一千一百二十九万五千五百余亩。省供销社根据华北人民政府决定，调运麦种一千五百万斤，分配到灾区，通过贷、卖、换三种方式供给农民，并发动群众互借互换。现各地种麦即将进入紧张阶段。
