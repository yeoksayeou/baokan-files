　　North China Higher Education Commission
    Decision on the Evaluation of People's Scholarships

    [This Dispatch] The North China Higher Education Commission made the following "Decision on the Re-evaluation of People's Scholarships" on October 1st:

    Based on the results of the preliminary meeting on the evaluation of People's Scholarships convened by the Commission on September 21st, attended by heads of student unions, Party and League branches of universities and colleges in Beijing and Tianjin, the following decisions are made regarding the re-evaluation of People's Scholarships:

    1. The evaluation work should be based on facts, and oppose deviations that are excessively rightist or excessively "leftist."

    First, we should recognize the significance of People's Scholarships, oppose the idea of comprehensive scholarships, oppose perfunctory work styles where applications are approved indiscriminately, and oppose wasteful phenomena that disregard the people's burdens. At the same time, we should also oppose excessively "leftist" thinking that abandons scholarships without regard to practical difficulties, oppose the vanguardist and mass-separated "leading" role of Party and League members, and oppose coercive command styles of tightening quotas and grades. We must be realistic and ensure that those who need and should enjoy scholarships (those who study hard and are willing to serve the people) certainly enjoy them, and those who do not need or should not enjoy them certainly do not.

    2. The evaluation work should first mobilize the masses ideologically and establish a correct system of commendation and criticism. The evaluation work is not a purely technical or administrative task. To do the work well, we must first mobilize the masses ideologically, recognize the significance of People's Scholarships and democratic evaluation work, and openly commend good ideas and criticize incorrect and backward ideas in the application and evaluation work, establishing correct learning viewpoints and the viewpoint of wholeheartedly serving the people.

    3. The evaluation work should be carried out under the leadership of the school's Party and League organizations, thoroughly following the mass line.

    The school's Party and League branches should earnestly and responsibly lead the work of evaluating scholarships, and at the same time thoroughly and genuinely follow the mass line, allowing the masses to be masters of their own affairs and handle their own affairs. Resolutely oppose the bureaucratic style of Party and League branches and student unions abandoning leadership, taking over everything, and issuing coercive commands.

    4. Everything should proceed from the policies of the People's Government and the Party, opposing purely economic viewpoints, task viewpoints, and egalitarianism.

    The New Democratic education policy lies in the focused and planned development of China's national, scientific, and popular (mainly worker-peasant) cultural and educational undertakings. Under the current conditions of national economic difficulty and the existing conditions of various schools, the number of scholarships for new and old students, and the number of scholarships for national and private universities, should be differentiated and must be differentiated, in order to achieve the task of focused development and gradually reducing the burden on the people. (Scholarships for students from old revolutionary base areas account for about 30 percent.) Therefore, the Commission has decided that the maximum quota limit for new student People's Scholarships and private university People's Scholarships should remain at the original 50 percent and 25 percent, respectively.

    There were many differences between normal school students and general college and middle school students during the Kuomintang rule. Under the New Democratic education policy, this difference has basically disappeared, so normal school students' scholarships should not be special. The idea of universally enjoying scholarships should be completely eliminated.

    5. Oppose tightening first and then loosening, and establish a regular and strict application, evaluation, and review system.

    When launching the masses in a mass movement to evaluate scholarships, the evaluation is often very strict, and sometimes even excessively "leftist," but after the high tide of the mass movement, there is often a phenomenon of laxity, carelessness, irresponsibility, and disregard for the people's burden, resulting in waste. The Commission requires the evaluation committee, student union, heads of evaluation groups at all department levels, and all students to establish a responsible, regular, and strict application, evaluation, and review system, eliminating the wasteful phenomenon that increases the people's burden.

    6. Look forward, oppose looking to the backward.

    Establish a correct system of commendation and criticism, so that everyone can learn from the departments, levels, and institutions that have done a good job in the evaluation work. Some students evaluate themselves strictly, but when they see that others have been approved even though their evaluations are very lax, they feel regret and disappointment. This is a backward idea of looking to the backward. We advocate looking forward and opposing looking backward or unprincipled accommodation to backward ideas.

    7. The evaluation work is a re-evaluation, not a review of the past.

    The re-evaluation work this semester is by no means a review. The right to enjoy scholarships in the past is completely negated, and a new application and evaluation is required (of course, the past evaluation materials are very good reference materials). Every student must affirm this point in their thinking in order for the work to be done well.

    Before this re-evaluation work, everyone is required to review their past advantages and disadvantages, and summarize their past experiences and lessons, and ideologically mobilize the masses to do a good job. In the work, not only should we complete the task of evaluating scholarships, but more importantly, everyone should improve politically and ideologically in the mass movement. If this is not achieved, it can be said with certainty that the work is not successful, even if the economic aspects are handled very tightly.

    8. Application, evaluation, and review time and methods.

    The re-evaluation work for old students requires all institutions to begin planning and launching the work on October 7th, first doing ideological mobilization and discussion work, and then doing application, evaluation, and review work, hoping to complete it within half a month.

    The evaluation work for new students requires all institutions to begin on November 10th.

    Regarding the issues of transfer students, returning students, and graduate students, instructions have been issued to various schools to refer to and implement them.

    The Commission requires all schools to establish fixed evaluation work organizations, such as evaluation committees and departmental evaluation groups, etc., to fully mobilize the creativity and enthusiasm of the masses under organized leadership and successfully complete the scholarship evaluation work.

    The People's Scholarship evaluation work is tentatively re-evaluated once per semester, and individual increases or decreases each month can be applied for and evaluated once. Submit reports to the Commission for review and approval on the specified date each month. And submit each student's application form (according to the previously published form, and should include the review opinions of the evaluation committee and evaluation group) together with each report to the Commission for review and approval.

    9. It is hoped that all institutions will refer to this decision and implement it in light of their own specific circumstances. And report the general situation of the evaluation work to the Commission.

　　华北高等教育委员会
    关于人民助学金评定工作的决定
    【本报讯】华北高等教育委员会于十月一日作出“关于人民助学金评定工作的决定”，原文如下：
    根据九月二十一日本会召集之京津各院校学生会、学校党、团支部负责人出席之人民助学金评定工作预备会议讨论之结果，作出关于人民助学金重评工作的下列决定：
    一、评定工作要实事求是，反对过右与过“左”的偏向。
    首先应认识人民助学金的意义，反对全面助学金的观点，反对马虎从事，申请就准的作风，反对不顾人民负担的浪费现象，同时也反对过“左”的不顾实际困难放弃助学金的思想，反对党团员积极分子先锋主义的、脱离群众的“带头”作用，反对强迫命令的紧缩名额及等级的作风，要实事求是的做到需要且应该享有助学金的（学习努力且愿为人民服务者）一定享有，不需要或不应该享有的一定没有。
    二、评定工作要先从思想上动员群众，建立正确的表扬与批评制度，评定工作不是一个单纯的技术或事务工作，要工作做得好必须先从思想上动员群众，认清人民助学金和民主评定工作的意义，在申请评定工作中要公开的表扬好的，批评不正确的与落后的思想，树立正确的学习观点及全心全意为人民服务的观点。
    三、评定工作要在学校党团的领导下，彻底的走群众路线。
    学校党团支部要认真的负责领导助学金评定的工作，同时要彻底的，真正的走群众路线，让群众自己当家做主人来办自己的事，坚决反对党团支部及学生会放弃领导及包办代替，强迫命令的官僚主义作风。
    四、一切从人民政府及党的政策出发，反对单纯的经济观点，任务观点及平均主义的思想。
    新民主主义的教育政策在于有重点的有计划的发展中国的民族的、科学的、人民大众的（主要是工农的）文化教育事业，在目前全国经济困难的条件下，在各校现有的条件下，新生与旧生的助学金，国立大学与私立大学的助学金名额应该有所区别，也必须有所区别，以达到重点发展及逐步的减轻人民负担的任务。（老区学校学生的助学金占百分之三十左右）因此本会决定新生人民助学金及私立大学人民助学金最高名额之限制仍维持原定之百分之五十与百分之二十五。
    师范学生与一般大中学生在国民党统治时期有许多区别，在新民主主义的教育政策下这种区别已基本上不存在了，所以师范生的助学金不应特殊。全面享有助学金的思想应彻底消除。
    五、反对先紧后松，建立经常的、严格的申请评定审查制度。
    助学金的评定在发动群众，造成一个群众性的评定助学金的运动时，常常是很严格的，甚至有时是过“左”的，但在平时群众运动的高潮后又往往发生放任松弛，粗枝大叶，不负责任的对人民负担不重视的浪费现象。本会要求评议委员会、学生会、各系级评议小组组长、全体同学建立起对人民负责的、经常的、严格的申请评定及审查制度，消灭增加人民负担的浪费现象。
    六、向前看、反对向落后看齐。
    建立正确的表扬与批评制度，使大家向评定工作做的好的系级院校看齐，有的同学自己评定的严格，看到人家评定的很松也同样批准了，觉得后悔，遗憾，这是一种向落后看齐的落后思想，提倡向前看，反对向后看或无原则的迁就落后思想。
    七、评定工作是重新评定而不是复查过去。
    本学期重新评定的工作绝不是复查。过去享有助学金的权利完全否定了，要重新申请评定（当然过去的评定材料是很好的参考资料）。每位同学在思想中要肯定这一点，工作才可能做得好。
    在这次重评工作前要求大家检讨过去的优点、缺点总结过去的经验教训，从思想上动员发动群众来做好工作。在工作中不只要完成评定助学金的任务，更重要的要在群众运动中大家在政治上思想上提高一步。做不到这一点，肯定的说工作不是成功的，纵然在经济上抓得很紧。
    八、申请评定审查时间和办法。
    旧生重评工作要求各院校于十月七日开始有计划的酝酿发动，先做思想动员讨论工作，再做申请评定与审查的工作，希望于半月时间内完成。
    新生评定工作要求各院校于十一月十日开始。
    转学生、复学生、研究生等问题，前已行文各校希参照执行。
    本会要求各校建立固定的评议工作的组织，如评议委员会，系级评议小组等，在有组织的领导下，充分发挥群众的创造性，积极性，胜利的完成助学金评定工作。
    人民助学金评定工作暂定每学期重评一次，每月个别增减者可申请评定一次。每月于规定之日期内报会核示。并于每次报会时将各生之申请表（照前发表格并应有评议委员会及评议小组审查的意见）一并报会以便核示。
    九、本决定希各院校结合自己具体情况参考施行。并将评定工作概况报会。
