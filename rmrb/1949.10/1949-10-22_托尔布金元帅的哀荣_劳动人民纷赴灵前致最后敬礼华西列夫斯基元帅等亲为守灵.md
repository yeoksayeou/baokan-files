Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st -- TASS Moscow dispatch: The remains of Soviet Marshal Tolbukhin were cremated in the Soviet capital on the morning of the 19th.

　　On the 18th, millions of Moscow's laboring people went to pay their last respects to Tolbukhin's remains, which were laid in state in the Hall of Columns of the Trade Unions. Around the catafalque and in the hall were piled wreaths presented by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Armed Forces, various people's organizations, and the fraternal parties, governments, and armies of the people's democratic countries.

　　The guard of honor included representatives of all branches of the armed forces, many of whom were veterans who had participated in the Patriotic War and had fought in the glorious battles under the command of Marshal Tolbukhin. At 6:30 PM, the guard of honor was relieved by Marshal Vasilevsky, Minister of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, Marshal Sokolovsky, Marshal Govorov, General of the Army Shtemenko, General of the Army Khrulyov, and Air Force General Zhigarev. Subsequently, they were relieved by textile workers from the capital, workers from the Stalin Automobile Factory, scientific workers, students, writers, actors, soldiers, officers, and generals of the Soviet Army and Navy.

　　From 3:00 PM until midnight, Moscow's men and women workers, collective farmers, intellectuals, heroes of the civil war who had fought under Tolbukhin's command, and veterans of the Patriotic War, flowed continuously into the Hall of Columns of the Trade Unions. The solemn and mournful melodies of Tchaikovsky, Chopin, and Craig echoed in the hall as people slowly and mournfully walked past the catafalque, paying their last respects to Marshal Tolbukhin and gazing upon his familiar and beloved countenance. They felt a deep affection for this loyal son of the Bolshevik Party, ardent patriot, and outstanding Stalinist military commander.

　　The lights illuminated the face of the deceased. The Marshal's Star and various medals pinned to his chest emitted a bright glow. This was a sign of the great service that this Stalinist military commander had rendered to the Soviet Union, to the people of our country, and to the people of the countries liberated by Marshal Tolbukhin's heroic forces.

　　Tolbukhin, the son of a peasant from Yaroslavl, traveled a glorious military path, from a soldier in the Russian Army to a Marshal of the Soviet Union. For more than thirty years, Tolbukhin selflessly devoted himself to the cause of strengthening the military might of the socialist motherland, and set an example of perfectly fulfilling his military duties to his country. During the Civil War, he underwent severe trials and hardships in many battles, winning victories for the young Soviet Republic. During the Great Patriotic War, the troops he led fought all the way from Stalingrad to the Austrian Alps, writing many glorious chapters in the Soviet Union's glorious military history. For many years, Tolbukhin engaged in training the Soviet Army and cultivated many Soviet generals and officers. He himself strove to enrich his knowledge of military art, and called on all his cadres and all his soldiers to do the same.

　　It was ten minutes to midnight. Those standing guard included: Bulganin, Shvernik, Soviet Marshals Vasilevsky, Sokolovsky, Govorov, Shtemenko, Kuznetsov, and Marshal of Artillery Yakovlev.

　　The midnight bell rang. The doors of the Hall of Columns closed. Members of the government funeral committee, Tolbukhin's friends, comrades-in-arms, and his relatives, gathered around the catafalque. At 2:00 AM on the 19th, the remains of Marshal Tolbukhin were cremated.

    劳动人民纷赴灵前致最后敬礼华西列夫斯基元帅等亲为守灵
    【新华社北京二十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联元帅托尔布金的遗体已于十九日晨在苏京火葬。
    十八日，千千万万的莫斯科劳动人民都去向停放在职工会圆柱大厅中的托尔布金的遗体致最后的敬礼。在灵台四周和大厅中，堆满了苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联部长会议、苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联武装部队、各人民团体、及人民民主国家的兄弟党、政府和军队所献的花圈。
    在守灵队中，有一切兵种的代表，其中有许多人是曾参加过爱国战争而且曾参加过托尔布金元帅指挥下的光荣战役的老战士。下午六点三十分，守灵队由苏联武装部队部部长华西列夫斯基元帅、索科洛夫斯基元帅、戈伏罗夫元帅、施蒂门柯陆军上将、赫鲁尔叶夫陆军上将、日加列夫空军上将接替。嗣后，又由首都的纺织女工、斯大林汽车工厂工人、科学工作者、学生、作家、演员、士兵、军官、和苏联陆军及海军的将领们接替。
    从下午三点钟直到深夜十二点钟，莫斯科的男女工人们、集体农民、知识分子、曾在托尔布金指挥下作战的内战英雄们和爱国战争中的老战士们，川流不息地进入职工会的圆柱大厅。柴霍夫斯基、萧邦和克莱格的严肃的哀乐的旋律，在大厅中回绕着，人们依次缓步哀痛地走过灵旁，向托尔布金元帅致最后的敬礼，并瞻仰他那熟悉而亲爱的遗容。他们对这个布尔什维克党的忠诚的儿子、热诚爱国者、斯大林式的卓越的军事将领，感觉十分亲切而且亲爱。
    灯光照明了死者的遗容。他胸前所佩戴的元帅星章及各种勋章发出明亮的光辉。这是这位斯大林式的军事将领对苏联、我们国家的人民、以及由托尔布金元帅的英勇部队所解放的国家的人民贡献了伟大服务的表示。
    托尔布金是雅罗斯拉伐尔的一个农民的儿子，他走过了光荣的军事路程，从俄国陆军中的一个士兵直到苏联元帅。三十多年来，托尔布金无我地献身于加强社会主义祖国军事力量的事业，并树立了对他的祖国圆满履行军事职责的榜样。内战时期，他曾在多次战役中经过严重的考验和困苦，为年青的苏维埃共和国争取了胜利。伟大爱国战争时期，他所率领的部队，从斯大林格勒一直打到奥地利的阿尔卑斯山，在苏联光荣的军事史上写下许多光荣的篇幅。托尔布金多年来从事训练苏联陆军，并培养了很多的苏联将领和军官。他本人曾努力地充实他的军事艺术的知识，并号召他的所有干部及所有士兵都这样做。
    差十分钟就到午夜了。守灵的计有：布尔加宁、斯维尔尼克、苏联元帅华西列夫斯基、索科洛夫斯基、戈伏罗夫、施蒂门柯、库兹涅佐夫和炮兵元帅雅科夫列夫。
    午夜的钟声响了。圆柱大厅的门关了。政府治丧委员会的委员们、托尔布金的友人们、战友们、他的亲属们，围绕在灵台的四周。十九日晨二时、托尔布金元帅的遗体火葬了。
