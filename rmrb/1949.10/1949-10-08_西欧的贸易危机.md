　　The Trade Crisis in Western Europe
　　By Ménjìnskī, Translated by Sī Yíng

　　The breath of economic crisis is not only being felt in the United States. Politicians and economists in Western European countries, like their American friends, have long been trying to conceal the symbols of this economic crisis, as if concealing a terrible disease. But now, concealment is impossible. The black shadow of the crisis not only shrouds the stock exchanges and banks, but has also spread to countless industrial and commercial enterprises.

　　This crisis has had the most serious impact on international trade. The unfortunate state of international trade is entirely the result of the rulers of Western European countries calling on their countries to follow American imperialism. The countries under the Marshall Plan are bound by the dollar, which is the main obstacle to the normal development of their foreign trade.

　　However, the economies of Western European countries mainly rely on foreign trade. They lack food and raw materials and must import considerable quantities from countries outside Europe. The war reduced many Western European countries' previous income from foreign investment, shipping, the passenger industry, and other sources. In the early years after the war, their export capacity was greatly weakened, and they had to use up their cash and dollar reserves to pay for the needed imports. There were deficits in both the trade balance and the balance of payments.

　　The total trade deficit of the seventeen Western European countries was $5.8 billion in 1946, $8.6 billion in 1947, and $7.5 billion in 1948. The Marshall Plan not only failed to remedy this situation, but made it worse. In 1948 and the first half of 1949, Western European countries had to consume another part of their cash and foreign assets. According to an estimate in May of this year, the total gold reserves of the central banks of the Marshall Plan countries were only $3.3 billion, and the total foreign exchange was only $1 billion.

　　In order to save this situation, Western European countries, regardless of domestic needs, have spared no effort to expand their exports, even at the cost of lowering domestic consumption. For example, the total export volume of the United Kingdom in the first five months of 1949 was 52 percent higher than in 1938, while its production volume was only 24 percent higher than in 1938; and 1938 was a year of panic. In 1948, the United Kingdom put 34 percent of its total machine tool production into foreign markets, nearly 42 percent of its steam engines, 57 percent of its textile machinery, and 71 percent of its vehicles. These items have not yet met domestic needs.

　　In March 1949, France's export volume was 35 percent higher than in 1938, but production volume was only 22 percent higher than that year's level. Machinery exports exceeded pre-war levels by 238 percent. She reduced domestic needs and exported as many motorcycles, railway equipment, and steel pipes as possible. Italy's shipbuilding, machinery, and textile industries are also producing for export. The same is true of many industries in West Germany and Belgium.

　　In this way, the total export value of all Western European countries increased from 8.7 billion yuan in 1946 to 17.2 billion yuan in 1948. Calculated by the average of the first four or five months of 1949, it can be raised to an annual value of 20.3 billion yuan in 1949.

　　The U.S. government is by no means happy about the fact that Western European countries are forced to increase their exports. In the early years after the war, the situation in foreign markets was quite favorable for the United States. But that was only a temporary phenomenon. By the end of last year, the situation was different.

　　In this situation, the competition from Western European countries threatens the monopolies of the United States. In 1947, the United States accounted for 34 percent of the total export trade in the capitalist world, and 26 percent in 1948. In the first five months of 1949, it dropped to 21 percent. The export trade of Western European countries fell to 29 percent in 1947 and increased to 36 percent in 1948. In the first few months of 1949, it rose to 38 to 39 percent.

　　This has caused a fierce battle between European and American monopolies for market share. The competition will intensify, and the impending economic crisis will become more acute.

　　First, the previous market competition between British and American monopolies has now revived, and the situation is more serious than before. The conflicts of interest between them are not limited to export trade. There are also conflicts of interest in foreign exchange (dollar zone and British zone), in raw material markets (oil, rubber, non-ferrous metals), in shipping and shipbuilding, and in colonial, semi-colonial and occupied areas (former Italian colonies, India, West Germany, Argentina, Japan, etc.). This confrontational situation has now become very acute.

　　The monopolists of the City of London in England lowered the living standards of the workers and increased the export volume from 4.6 billion yuan in 1947 to 6.6 billion yuan in 1948. According to the average of the first five months of 1949, the total amount for the whole year of 1949 may reach 7.5 billion yuan, which will almost account for 15 percent of the world's total exports.

　　Within the British imperial market, its monopoly capital occupies a dominant position. The countries ruled by British capital account for about 25 percent of the world's export trade. Britain is a major supplier of automobiles, tractors, ships, oil products, textiles, chemicals, and other goods in the world market.

　　The second is France. In the first few months of 1949, France's export volume exceeded that of Canada, ranking third in the export trade of capitalist countries. Her goods, mainly automobiles, textiles, chemical fertilizers, and agricultural machinery, also compete with similar American products in many countries.

　　West Germany's coal, automobiles, ships, and precision instruments, and Italy's machinery, textile machinery, automobiles, and synthetic fibers have also appeared in the international market, which has also deepened the acuteness of market competition.

　　American rulers feel threatened by these developments. American exporters complain that not only is American coal about to lose the European market, but also some "traditional" American exports (wheat, tobacco) will encounter difficulties in the Western European market. The so-called Economic Cooperation Committee, headed by Hoffman, has received many letters from coal and tobacco exporters, grain merchants, flour millers, textile manufacturers, vegetable oil producers, shipping companies, and insurance companies complaining about their difficulties in exporting to Europe. Hoffman has notified the governments of Western European countries that they do not welcome the increase in steel production in recent years. The steel companies in Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Ruhr discussed the organization of a Western European steel cartel, which was opposed by the American rulers from the beginning.

　　While striving to expand exports to Western Europe, American monopoly capital is doing its best to prevent the import of goods from these countries into the United States. This conflict of interest is becoming more serious as the economic crisis matures. In this regard, the United Kingdom can serve as a very clear example. The difficulties in British export trade can be expressed by the figures for June and April to June 1949. The total export value in June was £143,100,000, a decrease of £8,300,000 from May – automobiles and textiles decreased the most. The total import value in June was £201,700,000, an increase of £6,900,000 from May. The total trade deficit in June was £54,200,000, an increase of £16,400,000 from May.

　　From April to June this year, the total export value of the United Kingdom was £431,900,000, a decrease of £28,000,000 from January to March. From April to June, the total import value was £566,100,000, an increase of £43,300,000 from January to March. Cripps announced that the total trade deficit of the United Kingdom to the dollar zone was £160,000,000 in the first half of this year.

　　The economic contradictions between the United States and Western European countries are developing at a rapid pace. The contradictions between Western European countries are also becoming increasingly acute. Various conferences and committees on "European economic cooperation" have sprung up like mushrooms after rain in Marshallized Western Europe, but this cannot cover up the growth and increasing intensity of these contradictions.

　　Just remembering the still unfinished quarrel between the governments of the Marshall Plan countries on the "European internal payment problem" is enough to understand that the economic cooperation they flaunt is just like the cooperation between a group of spiders trapped in a glass bottle. It is becoming increasingly difficult to cover up this fact. Capitalist publications are full of words of mutual condemnation by ministers of various Western European governments and accusations against their American masters.

　　All Western European countries are increasing exports to the highest peak and reducing imports, especially imports from hard currency countries, to the lowest limit. However, the market within the capitalist world is limited. Moreover, with the establishment of new barriers to prevent imports, export trade is becoming more difficult day by day.

　　The economic contradictions between Western European countries have become very acute and will become more acute in the near future. This can be fully illustrated by the four-year international trade plan estimated by the Marshall Plan countries at the end of 1948. The United Kingdom expects to sell more than it purchases in Europe and prohibits the import of luxury goods. This is in direct contrast to France's plan, which plans to increase the quantity of wine, textiles, and other luxury goods exported to the United Kingdom. Belgium and Luxembourg plan to import large quantities of goods from overseas, which also conflicts with the plans of the United Kingdom and other Western European countries. In addition, the United States wants to rebuild Germany's heavy industry and increase trade between the United States and Germany by 25 percent compared with 1936. This shocked the Western European countries. From this, it seems that the so-called four-year plans of the Marshall Plan countries are in sharp opposition to each other in almost every aspect.

　　These situations deepen the domestic economic instability of Western European countries.

　　The total industrial production volume, mainly due to preparations for export, has returned to the pre-war level of 1936, but due to market difficulties, it is facing the threat of necessary reduction.

　　The initial economic crisis has made the United States strengthen its efforts to seize foreign markets and intensify its efforts to seize the positions that Western European countries have gained in the past year or year and a half. This has brought new misfortunes to Western European countries. Most of the goods that previously had foreign markets are now stagnant in the country, and the domestic market has also shrunk to the extreme due to the decline of the national economy and the low purchasing power. In the past few months, food sales have decreased everywhere, and the textile and clothing industries have been declining. The sales of furniture, radios, and household electrical appliances have decreased even more sharply.

　　Although the people's purchasing power has been greatly reduced, it is still continuing to decline. In addition to the decrease in export possibilities, the industrial production volume has been sharply reduced.

　　The dangerous signs of this reduction are very obvious. Standard Motor Company in the United Kingdom laid off 1,700 workers due to reduced exports, and Ford factories in Dagenham laid off many employees. Tractor factories and Dunlop tire companies in Coventry only work three days a week. The shipbuilding industry's order sheet was 1,814,000 tons in 1947, 1,345,000 tons in 1948, and the average number this year has dropped to 700,000 tons.

　　In France, the locomotive manufacturing industry is still working under reduced production volume, but what is manufactured is all orders from a year ago. Fifty percent is prepared for export. When these foreign orders are completed, the factory will have no work to do. Half of Belgium's wool industry is idle because it cannot get orders from France and the Netherlands. Italy has reduced the production volume of textiles, machinery, and other departments, which has greatly increased the already vast unemployed army.

　　The international trade of Western European countries is revolving in such an inescapable cycle. The current policies of their governments do not and cannot get them out of this predicament. The demands of American monopolists are very simple. They want European countries to lower tariffs and other trade and political barriers, restore multilateral trade, increase their imports from the United States as much as possible, and reserve the right for American exporters to convert their sales proceeds in Europe into dollars.

　　However, experience tells us that doing so will only accelerate the economic collapse of Western European countries, bankrupt their major industries, and turn them into colonies of American monopolists. Some rulers of Western European countries, although loyal to their American masters, want to find another way out. They advocate that Western European countries must expand exports to hard currency countries as much as possible, limit imports from these countries, and increase purchases from non-dollar areas. This includes bilateral agreements, stipulating strict exchange restrictions and licensing systems. The British government is working in this direction. The agreement between Britain and Argentina is a manifestation of this. This agreement is fiercely opposed by the United States.

　　However, this direction cannot open up a difficult situation. Reducing imports from the United States and other parts of the Western Hemisphere, and developing trade limited to the capitalist world on the basis of bilateral agreements, cannot balance the mutual payments between Western European countries. Because these countries mostly produce the same industrial products, these products cannot find a market in Western Europe. At the same time, these countries lack raw materials and food, which are not produced in Western Europe.

　　In this situation, it is very important for Western European countries to restore economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Faced with the arrival of the economic crisis, faced with the decline of industrial production and international trade, the rulers of Western European countries can no longer ignore the fact that there is no and will be no economic crisis in their neighbors in Eastern Europe. Moreover, in these countries, industry and international trade are expanding rapidly and confidently. These countries may be the most favorable trading customers.

　　The total industrial output of the Soviet Union in 1948 increased by 27 percent compared with 1947, and from April to June 1949, it increased by 20 percent compared with the same period in 1948. The industrial production index of Czechoslovakia in 1948 increased by 16 percent. Poland increased by 26 percent. Hungary increased by 32 percent. The economies of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries continue to develop this year. Their international trade, like industrial production, is developing faster than that of capitalist countries. Hungary's export trade in 1948 increased by 86 percent compared with 1947. Czechoslovakia increased by 31 percent. Poland increased by 113 percent. In total, the exports of the people's democratic countries in 1948 increased by 56 percent and imports increased by 46 percent.

　　The international trade policy of the American rulers aims to cut off the ties between Western European countries and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

　　This policy has two main goals: first, not to allow Western European countries to get rid of the shackles of the United States, and force them to continue to buy the raw materials and food they need from American monopolists at high prices. Second, the policy planners of the United States are still dreaming that adhering to trade discrimination against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries will hinder the economic progress of these countries. The figures published by the European Joint Economic Committee show that the quantity of goods exported by Western European countries to the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in 1948 was only 43 percent of that in 1938, and the quantity of imported goods was only 41 percent.

　　This spring, the United States demanded that Western European countries discriminate against trade with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and the demands were more shameless and harsher than before. The United Kingdom succumbed to this demand and announced an order on March 31 prohibiting the export of raw materials and machinery to the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The discrimination implemented by the French government was only slightly disguised. The Ansaldo factory in Italy refused to accept orders from the Soviet Union and stopped manufacturing oil drilling machinery ordered by Hungary and Romania. Many agricultural tractors ordered by Eastern European countries are piled up in Italian warehouses.

　　However, neither the pressure from the so-called omnipotent American monopolists nor the fanaticism of their European accomplices can cover up the obvious fact that if Western European countries sever ties with Eastern Europe, their economies will be paralyzed. Some agreements concluded between Western European countries and Eastern European countries at the end of 1948 and the beginning of 1949 are a manifestation of their voluntary or involuntary recognition of this fact.

　　Naturally, Western European countries must understand that Eastern European countries are no longer the agricultural raw material appendages of industrial Western Europe as they used to be. It is no longer possible to simply restore trade within Europe on this old basis, where Western European countries only used consumer goods above normal prices to exchange for food and raw materials. Economic cooperation with countries marching on the road to socialism must be built on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

### 西欧的贸易危机

　　西欧的贸易危机
    门金斯基  著  斯滢  译
    经济危机的气息不仅只在美国感受着，西欧各国的政治家及经济家们，同他们的美国友人一样，在很久以前，就在设法掩盖这经济危机的象征，象掩盖一个很可怕的病症似的。然而到现在，掩盖已不可能，危机的黑影不仅笼罩着证券交易所及银行，而且已传布到无数的工商企业方面。
    这危机对国际贸易之影响最为严重，现在国际贸易的不幸情形完全是由西欧各国的统治者叫他们国家跟着美国帝国主义走的结果。马歇尔化各国都受着金元的束缚，这是他们国外贸易的正常发展之主要障碍。
    然而西欧各国的经济主要是依靠国外贸易。他们的食粮及原料较为缺乏，必须由欧洲以外的国家输入相当数量，大战的结果削减了很多西欧国家以前在国外投资、海运、旅客业、及其他的收入，战争结束初年间，他们出口能力又大为减弱，不得不用掉他们现金与美元准备以偿付所需要的输入。无论在贸易差额上或支付差额上，都是赤字。
    十七个西欧国家贸易亏差总数在一九四六年为五十八亿美元，一九四七年为八十六亿美元，一九四八年为七十五亿美元。马歇尔计划不但未能对这种情形有所补救，反而使它更形恶化。一九四八年及一九四九年的上半年，西欧各国不得不再消耗另一部现金及国外资产。据今年五月的估计，马歇尔化各国的中央银行黄金库存总数不过三十三亿美元，外汇总数不过十亿美元。
    西欧各国为挽救这种局面，不顾国内的需要，不惜降低了国内消费，尽其全力扩充他们的出口。例如英国一九四九年前五个月的出口总量较一九三八年高出百分之五十二，而其生产量仅较一九三八年高百分之二十四；而且一九三八年是恐慌的年份。一九四八年英国投入国外市场的机器工具，为其全部百分之三十四。蒸气机差不多百分之四十二，纺织机百分之五十七，车辆百分之七十一。这些物品在国内是尚没有满足需要的。
    一九四九年三月间，法国出口量较一九三八年高出百分之三十五，但生产量仅较那年水平高百分之二十二，机器出口超出了战前百分之二百三十八。她减低了国内的需要，尽可能出口全部摩托车、铁道设置以及钢铁管。意大利的造船业、机器业、及纺织业也都是为出口而生产着。西德及比国的许多工业也是这样情形。
    这样，全部西欧国家的出口总值，从一九四六年的八十七亿元提高到一九四八年的一百七十二亿元。以一九四九年前四五个月平均数计算，一九四九年可提到年值二百零三亿元。
    美国政府对于西欧国家这种被迫提高出口事实是决不高兴的。战争才结束初年间，国外市场情形，对于美国颇为有利。但那只是暂时现象，去年年底，情形便已不同了。
    在这种情况下，西欧国家的竞争使美国的垄断受到威胁。一九四七年资本主义世界内的出口贸易总数，美国占百分之三十四，一九四八年百分之二十六。到一九四九年的前五个月中，则降到百分之二十一。而西欧国家的出口贸易在一九四七年降至百分之二十九，一九四八年增到百分之三十六。一九四九年的前几个月则升为百分之三十八至三十九。
    这引起了欧洲的与美国的独占之间为争夺市场的强烈战。争夺将日益加剧，而即将到来的经济危机也将更形尖锐。
    第一，英美的独占间以前的市场竞争现又复活，而且较前情形更为严重。他们之间的利益冲突不仅限于出口贸易。在外汇方面（美元区域及英国区域），在原料市场方面（油、橡胶、非铁金属），在海运及船业方面，在殖民地半殖民地及占领区方面（前意属殖民地、印度、西德、阿根廷、日本等）也是利害冲突。这种对立的形势，现在成为很尖锐。
    英国伦敦城的独占者们压低了工人的生活水准，把出口数额从一九四七年的四十六亿元提高到一九四八年的六十六亿元。而据一九四九年前五个月的平均数，一九四九年全年总额可能达到七十五亿元，这差不多要占全世界出口总额百分之十五。
    在英国帝国市场之内，她的垄断资本占统治地位，英国资本统治下的国家大约要占世界出口贸易百分之二十五。英国是世界市场中汽车、拖拉机、船、油产品、纺织品、化学药品、及其他货物之大供给者。
    其次是法国。一九四九年前几个月，法国出口数量超过加拿大，居资本主义国家出口贸易的第三位。她的货物，主要是汽车、纺织品、化学肥料及农业机器，在许多国家中，也与美国同类出品相竞争。
    西德的煤、汽车、船、精确仪器，意大利的机械、纺织机、汽车、人造纤维，又出现于国际市场，也加深了争夺市场的尖锐性。
    美国统治者对于这些发展感到威胁。美国出口商人口出怨言，说不仅美国的煤即将失掉欧洲的市场，就是一些“传统的”美国出口货物（小麦、烟草）也就要在西欧市场上遭遇到困难。以霍夫曼为首的所谓的经济合作委员会，接到很多煤及烟草出口商、谷物商人，面粉厂主、纺织制造家、植物油生产者、船业公司及保险公司诉说他们向欧洲输出困难的信。霍夫曼曾通知西欧各国政府不欢迎他们在最近几年中增加钢铁的出产量。英国法国比利时荷兰及鲁尔等地的钢铁企业商谈组织西欧钢铁卡尔德，在一开始时，便受到美国统治者的反对。
    美国独占资本一方面努力扩张向西欧的出口贸易，一方面尽其全力阻止这些国家的货物向美国输入。这种利益的对立，因经济危机之成熟，而更加严重。在这点上，英国可作一个很显明的例子。英国出口贸易的困难情形可由一九四九年六月及四月至六月的数字表示出来。六月份出口总值一四三、一○○、○○○镑。较五月份减少八、三○○、○○○镑——汽车及纺织品减少最多。六月份进口总值二○一、七○○、○○○镑，较五月份增加六、九○○、○○○镑。六月份入超总额五四、二○○、○○○镑，较五月份增加一六、四○○、○○○镑。
    今年四月到六月间英国出口总值四三一、九○○、○○○镑，较一月至三月减少二八、○○○、○○○镑。四月到六月进口总值五六六、一○○、○○○镑，较一月至三月增加四三、三○○、○○○镑。克里浦斯发表英国对美元区域的贸易亏损总额在今年上半年为一六○、○○○、○○○镑。
    美国与西欧各国间的经济矛盾以飞快的速度发展着。西欧各国之间的矛盾也日益尖锐化。各种“欧洲经济合作”的会议、委员会等等，雨后春笋般的在马歇尔化的西欧建立起来，但是这并不能掩盖这些矛盾之增长及其日益强烈。
    只要一想起马歇尔化国家各政府间对于“欧洲内部偿付问题”到现在尚未终止的争吵，就可以明白他们所夸示的经济合作，只不过如同一群被封闭在玻璃瓶子中的蜘蛛间的合作一样。要掩盖此一事实，已日益困难。资本主义的刊物充满了各西欧政府部长们互相谴责以及斥责他们美国主子的文字。
    所有的西欧国家都在提高出口到最高峰，而减少进口，特别是从用硬币国家的进口到最低限度。然而资本主义世界内的市场是有限的。而且，随着建立阻止进口的新壁垒，出口贸易便一天要比一天困难了。
    西欧国家间的经济矛盾已经得很尖锐了，在最近的将来且要更加尖锐。这点可由马歇尔化国家在一九四八年年底所估计的国际贸易四年计划充分表明出来。英国预计在欧洲的售出要超过购入，并且禁止奢侈品入口。这与法国的计划正相对立，法国计划是要增加对英国输出酒、纺织品及其他奢侈品的数量的。比利时，卢森堡计划从海外输入大批物资，与英国及其他西欧国家计划也正相冲突。此外，美国要重建德国的重工业，要把美德间的贸易较一九三六年提高百分之二十五。这使西欧国家大吃一惊。由此看来，马歇尔化各国家所谓的四年计划，几乎在每一项上，都是互相尖锐对立着的。
    这种种情况加深了西欧各国国内经济的不稳定。
    工业的总生产量，主要是因准备出口，都恢复了一九三六年战前的水平，但因市场困难，都面临着必需缩减的威胁。
    初期的经济危机使美国加强争取国外市场，使她更加紧努力夺取西欧各国在过去一年或一年半间所获有的阵地。这带来了西欧国家新的不幸。大部分以前有国外市场的货物现在都停滞于国内，而国内市场则因国民经济的衰败及购买力的低下也紧缩到了极点。在过去几个月中，各处的食品售出都见减少，纺织业衣饰业日趋没落。而家具、无线电及家庭电气器具的售出更为锐减。
    人民购买力虽已大大缩小，但仍在继续下降之趋势。再加上出口可能性的减小，使工业生产量剧烈的减缩。
    这种减缩底危险象征已很显明。英国标准摩托公司因出口减少解雇了一千七百名工人，达金汉的福特工厂遣散很多雇员。考文得利的拖拉机厂及邓禄普车胎公司每星期只工作三日，造船业的订品单一九四七年为一、八一四、○○○吨，一九四八年为一、三四五、○○○吨，今年的平均数则降低到七○○、○○○吨。
    在法国，机车制造业虽仍在降低的生产量下工作着，但所制造的都是一年以前的订货。百分之五十是预备出口的。当这些国外订货制造完了时，工厂就将无工可做，比国的羊毛业因不能得法国及荷兰的订购，半数已空闲着。意大利削减了纺织、机器及其他部门的生产量，使已经很广大的失业部队更增加了很多。
    西欧国家的国际贸易就在这样的一个无法逃脱的循环圈中团团转着。他们政府的现行政策并没有也不可能使他们脱离这困境。美国垄断资本家们的要求是很简单的，他们要使欧洲国家降低关税及其他贸易与政治的壁垒，恢复多边的贸易，尽可能增加其从美国的输入，并给美国出口商保留把他们在欧洲的售货所得换成美元的权利。
    但是，经验告诉我们，这样做只能加速西欧国家经济的崩溃，使他们主要的工业破产，把他们变成美国垄断资本家的殖民地。一些西欧国家的统治者，虽然忠心于其美国主子，却都想另外找一条出路。他们主张西欧国家必须尽量扩充向使用硬币的国家出口，限制从这些国家输入货物，并增加从非美元区域的购入。这包括双边协定，规定着严格汇兑限制及许可证制度。英国政府就向着这个方向努力。英国与阿根廷间的协定，就是此种表现。这个协定是为美国所激烈反对的。
    然而这个方向也不能打开困难局面。减少由美国及西半球其他部分的进口，发展建筑在双边协定基础上局限于资本主义世界内的贸易，并不能使西欧各国间的互相支付得到平衡。因为这些国家大都生产着同类的工业品，这些生产品并不能在西欧找到市场，同时这些国家又都缺乏原料及食粮，而这些原料及食粮又都不是西欧所生产的。
    在这种情况下，西欧国家与苏联及各人民民主国家之间恢复经济合作是十分重要的。面临着经济危机的到来，面临着工业生产及国际贸易的衰落，西欧国家的统治者们不能再忽略一个事实，就是，在他们的邻居东欧各国内并没有、将来也不会有经济危机的发生。而且在这些国家内，工业及国际贸易都在飞耀地有把握地扩张着。这些国家可能是最有利的贸易顾客。
    苏联一九四八年的工业总产量较一九四七年提高了百分之二十七，一九四九年四月至六月较一九四八年的同期增高了百分之二十。捷克斯拉夫一九四八年的工业生产指数升高了百分之十六。波兰升高百分之二十六。匈牙利升高百分之三十二。苏联及人民民主国家的经济，今年仍继续发展着。他们的国际贸易，与工业生产一样，比资本主义国家发展得快。匈牙利一九四八年的出口贸易与一九四七年相较增加了百分之八十六。捷克斯拉夫增加百分之三十一。波兰增加百分之一百一十三。总计起来，各人民民主国家一九四八年的出口增加百分之五十六，入口增加百分之四十六。
    美国统治者的国际贸易政策，目的是要切断西欧国家与苏联及人民民主国家的联系。
    这政策有两个主要目标：第一，不使西欧国家脱离美国的羁绊，强迫他们继续用高价从美国垄断资本家手中购买他们所需用的原料及食粮。第二，美国的政策计划者仍在做着幻梦，以为坚持着对于苏联及人民民主国家的贸易歧视，就能阻碍这些国家的经济进步。欧洲联合经济委员会所发表的数字，表示着西欧国家一九四八年向苏联及人民民主国家输出货物的数量，只为一九三八年的百分之四十三，进口货物只为百分之四十一。
    今年春季，美国要求西欧国家对苏联及人民民主国家的贸易，加以歧视，要求来得较以前更加无耻，更加苛刻。英国屈服于此种要求，在三月三十一日公布一个命令，禁止向苏联及人民民主国家输出原料及机器。法国政府所实行的歧视，则仅稍加伪装。意大利的安萨多工厂拒绝接受苏联的订货单，对于匈牙利及罗马尼亚所订购的掘油机械停止制造。许多东欧国家所订制的农业拖拉机都在意大利的仓库里堆着。
    但是，无论所谓全能的美国垄断资本家的压力或者他们的欧洲帮凶们的狂热，都不能掩盖一个很明显的事实，就是，假如西欧国家与东欧断绝关系，则他们的经济将陷于麻痹。在一九四八年年底及一九四九年年初，西欧国家与东欧国家间所成立的一些协定就是他们自愿的或不自愿的承认这一事实的表现。
    自然，西欧国家必须了解东欧国家现在已不再同以前一样是工业西欧的农业原料的附属物了。以前西欧国家只用一些高于平常价格的消费品换取食粮及原料，现在要想简单的在这旧基础上恢复欧洲内的贸易已不可能。与向着社会主义道路上迈进的国家实行经济合作必须建筑在平等互惠的基础上。
