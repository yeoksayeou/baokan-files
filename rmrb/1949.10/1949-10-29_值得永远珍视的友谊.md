　　A Friendship Worth Cherishing Forever
    Xu Beihong
    Soviet artists have staunchly and continuously struggled against bourgeois art and naturalism and formalism, which Western European painters flaunt as standards. They have finally achieved the standard of works with socialist content and national form, as spoken of by Stalin.

　　Mr. Finogenov, a member of this Soviet cultural delegation, is a typical painter of this kind. He personally participated in the Battle of Stalingrad and won the Stalin Prize for his depictions of the war at that time. During his visit to Beijing with the delegation, he had three gatherings with our artists, providing us with invaluable experiences and opinions. He sincerely hopes that our artists can achieve great success in the work of building a new China. Former delegation leader Mr. Fadeyev also warmly encouraged the young artists of the new China. This great and sincere friendship is worth cherishing forever. We must redouble our efforts! We must not fail the hopes and expectations of our Soviet friends!

　　值得永远珍视的友谊
    徐悲鸿
    苏联艺术家坚强地与西欧画商标榜的资产阶级艺术和自然主义及形式主义作了不断的斗争，终于达到了斯大林所说的具有社会主义内容和民族形式的作品的标准。
    这次苏联文化代表团中的费诺格诺夫先生便是这一典型的画家，他亲身参加了斯大林格勒保卫战，以描写当时战争的情况而获得斯大林奖金，这次随团来北京，曾经三次和我们美术家聚谈，向我们提供了无数宝贵的经验和意见，他极诚恳地希望我们美术家能在建设新中国的工作上获得伟大的成就。前代表团团长法捷耶夫先生也极热诚地勖勉着新中国的青年艺术家，这种伟大的真挚的友谊是值得我们永远珍视的。我们必须加倍努力！必须不辜负苏联友人的希望和期待！
