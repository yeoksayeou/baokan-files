　　Summary of Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's Report to the Third Session of the Cadre Training Class of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

[Beijing News] The third session of the Cadre Training Class of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is about to conclude after two and a half months of study. The trainees in this session are all workers from state-owned factories. Therefore, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De was specially invited to give a report on the issue of restoring and developing production on the morning of September 26.

　　Commander-in-Chief Zhu De first instructed the students on "how the working class can be masters in factories and how to lead the country." He said: State-owned factories were originally created by the blood and sweat of workers and peasants. Now they have been taken back from the hands of the Kuomintang reactionaries. This is returning things to their rightful owners. From now on, the working class begins to be the masters of the house. Since the working class has become the master and the leading class of the country, it must be selfless, work hard to develop production, and serve the people. Workers develop production and serve the people, which is also to improve their own lives. Because when the factories are run well, production is developed, and the national economy is prospering, workers will have the material conditions to improve their lives. It also solves the difficulties in the lives of the workers themselves and their families.

　　Commander-in-Chief Zhu De emphasized that the factory directors and managers of state-owned factories now manage the factories on behalf of the state. They are workers, masters, and responsible masters. They are part of the workers and are "our own people" of the employees, not outsiders. Workers cannot treat their own factory directors and managers with the same attitude they used to treat the factory directors of the Kuomintang rulers before liberation; they must unite to manage the factory. At the same time, factory directors and managers must follow the mass line, be democratic, and rely on the masses of workers to develop production. For example, when formulating production plans, they should be thoroughly discussed in the factory management committee with the full participation of worker representatives. Fully absorb and concentrate the opinions of the workers, so as to give full play to the enthusiasm of the workers and smoothly complete the production plan. Since the working class has become the master, developing production is the right and responsibility of the master, and we should put production first and completing the production plan first. We must improve quality, increase quantity, and reduce costs. This requires us to improve our technology. And we must especially cherish the property of the people's country, oppose waste, and earnestly achieve full and economical use of machines and raw materials. Even a piece of broken copper or a piece of scrap iron must be picked up and used well. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De said: "The working class should protect the factory's machines and all state property as if they were protecting their own eyes."

　　Commander-in-Chief Zhu De also emphasized the importance of Marxism-Leninism and the Communist Party to the worker comrades. He pointed out that the struggles of the world's working class before the emergence of Marxism all failed. Since Marx and Engels' "Communist Manifesto," and with the Communist Party led by Lenin and Stalin in Russia successfully completing the revolution and building the socialist Soviet Union, and with the Communist Party led by Chairman Mao in China, we have defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries and all enemies supported by American imperialism, and victoriously created the New Democratic People's Republic of China. The working class can only achieve such victories with Marxism and the leadership of the Communist Party.

　　Commander-in-Chief Zhu De finally pointed out that the working class is the leading class of the country and should set an example, take the lead, and unite the broad masses of people of all democratic classes to jointly build a new democratic society. We should "endure hardship first, enjoy happiness later," and gradually achieve that everyone in society has work, food, clothing, shelter, and education in the restoration and development of production. This is our desired goal. Whether this goal can be achieved quickly depends entirely on the efforts and leadership of the working class. The harder our working class works and the faster production develops, the sooner the happy days will come.

　　朱总司令向中共北京市委干部训练班第三期学员的报告摘要
    【北京讯】中共北京市委会干部训练班第三期经过两个半月的学习，最近即将结束，该期学员均为公营工厂工人，故特请朱总司令于九月二十六日上午作了关于恢复发展生产问题的报告。
    朱总司令首先指示学生“工人阶级怎样在工厂做主人和怎样领导国家”。他说：公营工厂本来是工人和农民用血汗创造出来的，现在从国民党反动派手中收回来了，这是物归原主，工人阶级从此开始当家做主人。工人阶级当了主人，成为国家的领导阶级，就必须大公无私，努力发展生产，为人民服务。工人发展生产，为人民服务，同时也就是为了工人自己改善生活。因为把工厂搞好了，生产发展了，国家经济繁荣起来了，工人的生活改善就有了物质条件。也就解决了工人自己和家庭生活的困难。
    朱总司令着重说明：现在国营工厂的厂长和经理是代表国家管理工厂的，他们是工人，也是主人，而且是负责的主人，是工人中的一部分，是职工的“自己人”，并不是外人，工人不能拿过去在解放前对待国民党统治者的厂长的态度来对付自己的厂长和经理；必须团结一致的来管理工厂。同时当厂长经理的，管理工厂必须走群众路线，讲民主，依靠工人群众来发展生产，譬如订生产计划，就应好好在有充分的工人代表参加的工厂管理委员会中来讨论。充分吸收和集中工人的意见，这样才能充分发扬工人的积极性，顺利地完成生产计划。工人阶级既然当了主人，发展生产是主人的权利和责任，应当做到生产第一，完成生产计划第一，必须提高质量，增加数量，减低成本。这就要求我们提高技术。并且要特别爱护人民国家的财产，反对浪费，切实做到充分经济地使用机器和原料，那怕是一块破铜，一块烂铁，也要好好拾起来，并且好好地使用它。朱总司令说：“工人阶级应该象保护自己的眼睛一样来保护工厂的机器和一切国家财产”。
    朱总司令又着重告诉工人同志们马列主义和共产党的重要性，他指出世界工人阶级的斗争在马克思主义产生之前都失败了，自从有了马克思、恩格斯的“共产党宣言”，俄国有了列宁、斯大林领导的共产党胜利的完成了革命，建设了社会主义的苏联，中国有了毛主席领导的共产党，就战胜了美帝国主义支持的国民党反动派及一切敌人，胜利地创立了新民主主义的中华人民共和国。工人阶级只在有了马克思主义和共产党领导才能够得到这样的胜利。
    朱总司令最后指出：工人阶级是国家的领导阶级，应当以身作则，自己走在前面，团结各民主阶级的广大人民，共同的来建设新民主主义社会。应当“吃苦在前，享受在后”，在恢复发展生产中，逐渐做到使社会上人人有工作，有饭吃，有衣穿，有屋住，有书念，这是我们的要求目标。能不能迅速达到这个目标，这就全看工人阶级的努力如何，领导如何。我们工人阶级越努力，生产发展的越快，幸福的日子也就来得更快了。
