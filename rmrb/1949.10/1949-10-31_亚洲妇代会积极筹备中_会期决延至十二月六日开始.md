Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th—Active preparations are underway for the Asian Women's Representative Conference. Since the arrival in Beijing of international Democratic Women's Federation representatives Simone Bertrand, Tamara Marosova, Nina Yelemyeeva, and Soviet Central Asian Kyrgyz Republic women's representative Kuriba Toktomanbetova, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation has appointed Cai Chang, Li Dequan, Zhang Qinqiu, and Lu Cui to form the Asian Women's Representative Conference Preparatory Work Committee with the aforementioned four representatives to begin work. The committee appointed Cai Chang as the director and established five groups for organization, publicity, editing and reviewing, exhibitions, and technology. After Korean representatives Kim Gwi-sun and Ahn Hyo-sang arrived in Beijing on the 30th, they joined the work of the committee. Once representatives from other countries participating in the preparatory committee arrive in China successively in mid-November, the current working committee will be expanded into a formal preparatory committee.

In addition to the three items previously decided by the International Democratic Women's Federation (namely: (1) Asian women's struggle for national independence, democracy, and peace, with a report by China; (2) the issue of protecting women's rights, with a report by Iran; (3) the issue of protecting children's rights, with a report by India), the agenda of the Asian Women's Representative Conference will, according to the proposal of the Chinese Women's Federation and with the approval of the International Democratic Women's Federation, add an item, namely, the struggle of the International Democratic Women's Federation to defend world peace, with a report by the International Democratic Women's Federation.

Due to the fact that the next council meeting of the International Democratic Women's Federation will be held in Moscow from November 15th to 20th, and many representatives attending the Asian Women's Representative Conference must come to China after the closing of the council meeting, the Asian Women's Conference has decided to postpone the meeting to December 6th-12th.

According to the latest news from the International Democratic Women's Federation, official representatives attending the Asian Women's Conference will come from six Asian republics of the Soviet Union, China, Mongolia, North Korea, and other Asian countries. Guests will include representatives from the Soviet Union, Britain, France, the United States, the Netherlands, and other countries. The International Democratic Women's Federation will also send two representatives to provide guidance.

During the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference and the Asian Women's Representative Conference, a joint exhibition will be held. China, the various Asian republics of the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Mongolia will participate in the exhibition. Other Asian countries will also have photo exhibitions.

Currently, all preparatory work is being actively carried out.

　　亚洲妇代会积极筹备中　
    会期决延至十二月六日开始
    【新华社北京三十日电】亚洲妇女代表会议筹备工作在积极进行中。自从国际民主妇女联合会的代表西蒙·贝特朗，塔玛拉·玛洛索娃，尼娜·耶列梅耶娃和苏联中央亚细亚吉尔吉斯共和国之妇女代表库里巴·托克托曼别托娃四人抵达北京后，中华全国民主妇女联合会业已推定蔡畅、李德全、张琴秋、陆璀四人与上述四位代表共同组成亚洲妇女代表会议筹备工作委员会，开始工作。该委员会推定蔡畅为主任委员，下设组织、宣传、编审、展览、技术五组。朝鲜代表金贵善、安孝相二人于三十日到京后，即加入该委员会工作。一俟其他各国参加筹委会之代表于十一月中陆续前来中国后，现在的工作委员会即将扩大成为正式筹备委员会。
    亚洲妇女代表会议的议程，除国际妇联以前所决定之三项（即：（一）亚洲妇女为民族独立、民主、和平而斗争，由中国作报告；（二）保卫妇女权利问题，由伊朗作报告；（三）保卫儿童权利问题，由印度作报告；）外，根据中国妇联之提议，并得到国际妇联批准，将增加一项，即国际妇联为保卫世界和平而斗争，由国际妇联作报告。
    会议日期，由于国际妇联下届理事会将于十一月十五——二十日在莫斯科举行，出席亚洲妇女代表会议的许多代表必须在理事会闭幕后方能前来中国，故亚洲妇女会议已决定延期至十二月六日——十二日举行。
    据国际妇联方面最后消息，参加亚洲妇女会议之正式代表将来自苏联六个亚洲共和国、中国、蒙古、朝鲜及其他亚洲国家。来宾方面将有苏联、英国、法国、美国、荷兰等国之代表。国际妇联亦将有二位代表前来指导。
    在亚澳工会会议及亚洲妇女代表会议举行期间，将举行联合展览会。展览会中将有中国、苏联各亚洲共和国、朝鲜、蒙古等国参加。其他亚洲各国亦将有照片展览。
    现一切筹备工作正在积极进行中。
