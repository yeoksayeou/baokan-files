Zhu Zhuguang, the second battalion commander of the bandit "Zhejiang East Anti-Communist Self-Defense Force," Lin Ru, the fourth battalion commander, and other bandit leaders such as Yang Huajun, totaling 125 people, surrendered to the People's Liberation Army. In the Jian'ou and Nanping areas of northern Fujian, with the assistance of the broad masses of the people, the People's Liberation Army successively annihilated more than 600 bandits in Nanping, Gutian, Shaxian, Jiyang, Jian'ou, Shaowu and other areas, seizing a large number of light and heavy weapons. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army killed more than 300 bandits of the "Big Sword Society," including the Kuomintang special agent bandit leader Huang Taishun, in early September, and won over more than 200 scattered bandits in Gutian and Shunchang to surrender. In the Hubei area, the People's Liberation Army vigorously launched key suppression operations in the Huangpao Mountain area of Tongcheng at the junction of Hunan and Hubei, and the Dabie Mountain area at the junction of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui in September, and launched a mass movement to oppose local bullies and eliminate bandits in Macheng, Huanggang, Xiangyang and other areas, achieving remarkable results. A total of 1,200 bandits were annihilated in one month. The captured items included 3 mortars, 3 sixty mortars, 53 light and heavy machine guns, 1,318 long and short guns, and a portion of other military supplies.
