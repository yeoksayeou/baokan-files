Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Frontline, 22nd. Frontline reporter reports on the liberation of Xiamen by the People's Liberation Army, stating: After the Kuomintang bandit army lost more than 50,000 troops in the Fuzhou campaign in mid-August, they ordered the defeated General Tang Enbo to replace Zhu Shaoliang, moving the Fuzhou Pacification Headquarters to Xiamen. They gathered remnants of the Sixth, Eighth, Sixteenth, and Twenty-second Army Corps, which had been repeatedly dealt annihilating blows by the People's Liberation Army, as well as traffic police, youth army, air defense brigades, totaling more than 60,000 bandit remnants. These were distributed on the islands of Jinmen, Gulangyu, Pingtan, and inland areas of southern Fujian such as Zhangzhou. On Xiamen Island, they constructed so-called "modernized" fortifications day and night, building groups of reinforced concrete bunkers. They laid mines, electric fences, barbed wire, landmines, chevaux-de-frise, and wooden stakes in the harbor, beaches, and deep waters, organizing a water and land defense system, attempting to resist stubbornly from the islands.

After a short period of reorganization and training, the People's Liberation Army, which had liberated Fuzhou, bravely advanced south while the bandit gangs were still in shock. They first swiftly liberated Pingtan Island, southeast of Fuzhou, on September 16th, kicking off the Zhangzhou-Xiamen campaign. Then, they advanced rapidly south along the Fuzhou-Xiamen highway, successively capturing twelve county towns including the important towns of Zhangzhou and Haicheng in southern Fujian, and more than thirty important towns and cities on the periphery of Xiamen, such as Jimei, Songyu, Jiaowei, and Liuwudian, eliminating more than 21,000 Kuomintang bandit remnants, successfully concluding the first stage of the liberation of Xiamen campaign, completely exposing Xiamen Island to the iron fist of the People's Liberation Army.

In early October, the good news of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government reached the front lines. All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army were overjoyed and inspired, intensifying their enemy front studies during gaps in time, conducting cross-sea combat, reconnaissance of the enemy situation and terrain, repeatedly studying attack steps, and fully preparing for cross-sea operations and the liberation of Xiamen.

At 21:00 on the 15th, the cross-sea attack began. Under the bombardment cover of hundreds of artillery pieces, the People's Liberation Army set sail from ports and positions such as Xiangshan, Aoguan, Maluan, Gaopu, Jimei, and Liuwudian, heading straight for Xiamen Island and Gulangyu to its west. The People's Liberation Army, crossing the wide sea of three to ten li from Aoguan eastward, first broke through the bandit's modernized reinforced concrete fortifications and heavily defended defensive positions at 21:10, successfully landing south of Shihushan in northern Xiamen Island. Other attacking units also successfully landed successively at the southern part of Gulangyu and multiple locations in northern Xiamen, including Hou Lianwei, Gaoqi Airport, and Shenshan, after two hours of fierce beachhead battles, occupying and consolidating the beachhead positions, and then launched fierce attacks into the depth. One unit of the People's Liberation Army, which landed on the northern end of Xiamen Island, annihilated the entire 222nd Regiment of the 74th Division of Liu Ruming's bandit troops in the Andou and Fanghu areas. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army assault troops completely annihilated the regimental headquarters of the 542nd Regiment of the bandit army's 181st Division in Xiamadun and other places after landing that night. The People's Liberation Army, which swiftly attacked the airport, also captured an aircraft, a tank, and an American-style howitzer. The landing People's Liberation Army fought with unparalleled tenacity, defeating multiple counterattacks by the bandits. By 12:00 noon on the 16th, the People's Liberation Army successively captured the Shenshandi, Haokou, and Tianli line of positions of the Gaoqi Fortress battery, completely controlling the northern half of Xiamen Island. In order not to allow the bandit army to catch its breath and escape, the People's Liberation Army launched a multi-pronged attack to the south. Under the pincer attack of the People's Liberation Army's western and northern armies, the bandit remnants completely wavered on all fronts on the night of the 16th, and fled in panic towards the southern coast. More than 10,000 people trampled and crowded each other in the narrow coastal area of Huangcuo to Zengcuo'an in the southeastern corner of Xiamen Island, desperately calling for ships to save them across the sea. At dawn on the 17th, a vanguard battalion of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army broke into the urban area of Xiamen, completely annihilating two entire regiments of the defending enemy. At 11:00, the attacking units of the People's Liberation Army converged in the southeastern part of Xiamen Island, successively capturing the coastal line of Huangcuo, Zengcuo'an, Baishi Battery, Hulishan Battery, Xiamen University, and Xiamen Port, completely annihilating the bandit remnants who attempted to escape by sea. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army liberated Gulangyu and Wuyu, south of Xiamen, on the night of the 16th. At this point, the People's Liberation Army, advancing into Fujian, completely liberated Xiamen Island, the "strategic base" that the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang used to "ensure Taiwan," achieving another glorious victory after the liberation of Fuzhou.

  　解放厦门经过
    【新华社福建前线二十二日电】前线记者报道人民解放军解放厦门的经过称：八月中旬，国民党匪军在福州战役丧师五万余人之后，复令败将汤匪恩伯代替朱匪绍良，将福州绥署搬到厦门，凑集屡遭人民解放军歼灭性打击的第六、第八、第十六、第二十二等兵团残部，及交通警察、青年军、航空警备旅等，共六万余残匪，分布于金门、鼓浪屿平潭诸海岛及闽南内陆之漳州等地，并在厦门岛上，日夜构筑所谓“现代化”工事，遍筑钢骨水泥的地堡群，在港口、沙滩及深水中敷设水雷、电网、铁丝网、地雷、鹿砦、木桩等障碍物，组织水陆防御体系，企图凭借海岛顽抗。
    解放福州的人民解放军经短期整训后，即乘匪帮惊魂未定之际，奋勇南进。首于九月十六日神速解放福州东南的平潭岛，揭开漳州、厦门战役的序幕。继即沿福州、厦门公路向南疾进，连克闽南重镇漳州、海澄等县城十二座，和集美、嵩屿、角尾、刘五店等厦门外围重要市镇三十余处，消灭国民党残匪二万一千余人，胜利结束解放厦门战役的第一阶段，使厦门海岛完全暴露在解放军的铁拳之下。
    十月初，中华人民共和国及中央人民政府成立的喜讯传到前线，解放军全体指战员莫不欢腾鼓舞，加紧利用空隙时间，投入敌前学习，进行渡海战斗，侦查敌情、地形，反复研究攻击步骤，充分做好渡海作战、解放厦门的准备工作。
    十五日二十一时，渡海攻击开始，人民解放军在数百门大炮的轰击掩护下，分别从象山、鳌冠、马鸾、高铺、集美、刘五店等港口阵地，扬帆鼓桨，直指厦门岛及其以西之鼓浪屿。由鳌冠东渡的解放军越过三里至十里的宽阔的海面，首于二十一时十分突破匪近代化钢骨水泥工事与重兵守备的防御阵地，在厦门岛北部石湖山以南胜利登陆。其他各路攻击部队，经过两小时激烈的滩头战斗，也先后于鼓浪屿南部与厦门北部之后莲尾、高崎飞机场、神山等多处登陆成功，占领并巩固了滩头阵地，随以猛烈动作向纵深发展。在厦门岛北端登陆的一部解放军，于安兜、坊湖地区歼灭匪刘汝明部七四师二二二团全部。另部解放军突击部队，于当晚登陆后即在下马墩等地全歼匪军一八一师五四二团团部。神速攻进飞机场之解放军，并缴获飞机一架，坦克一辆。美式榴弹炮一门。登陆的各部解放军以无比顽强战斗，击溃了歼匪多次反扑。至十六日中午十二时解放军相继攻占高崎要塞炮台之神山殿、壕口、田里一线阵地，全部控制厦门岛北半部。为不使匪军喘息逃逸，解放军多路矛头复向南猛进。在解放军西、北路大军钳击下，残匪十六日夜全线动摇，仓皇向南海边溃窜。万余人互相践踏拥挤，在厦门岛东南角黄厝至曾厝鞍之狭小海滨地带，绝望地隔海狂呼舰艇救命。十七日拂晓，解放军某部先头一个营即突入厦门市区，全歼守敌两个整团。十一时，解放军各路攻击部队于厦门岛东南部会合，相继攻克黄厝、曾厝鞍、白石炮台、胡里山炮台、厦门大学、厦门港等沿海一线，将妄图从海上逃命之残匪完全歼灭。另部解放军则于十六日晚解放鼓浪屿及厦门以南之梧屿。至此，进军福建的人民解放军乃将国民党残余匪帮作为“确保台湾”的“战略基地”——厦门岛全部解放，获得了解放福州之后的又一光辉胜利。
