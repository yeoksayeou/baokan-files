　　Harbin Holds 70,000-Strong Rally
  　Publicly Commemorate General Li Zhaolin
    [Special Dispatch from our Harbin Correspondent on the 20th] On the afternoon of the 19th, 70,000 people from all walks of life in Harbin gathered with extremely heavy hearts and indignation in Zhaolin Park Square to hold a public memorial meeting for General Li Zhaolin. A portrait of General Zhaolin was hung high in the center of the rostrum, with long white banners hanging on both sides: "Eliminate the remnant bandit gangs and avenge General Zhaolin! Heighten political vigilance and prevent sabotage by special agents!" The venue was very simple and solemn, and those present were filled with infinite sorrow and excitement. After laying flowers at General Zhaolin's tomb, Mayor Rao Bin pointed out to the masses present: "Chiang Kai-shek's special agents murdered General Zhaolin in a vain attempt to undermine the people's revolutionary cause. Although General Zhaolin was brutally murdered, the people's revolutionary cause has achieved a nationwide victory that cannot be hindered. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, the chief culprits, will inevitably be punished by the people!" He called on everyone to heighten their political vigilance, strictly guard against sabotage by special agents, conscientiously carry out urban construction, inherit the legacy of the martyrs, and carry the revolution through to the end.
