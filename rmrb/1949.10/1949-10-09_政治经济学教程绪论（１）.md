　　Political Economics Tutorial Introduction (1)
    Wang Xuewen
  　The Object, Task, and Characteristics of Political Economics Research
    Foreword: In order to study political economics, the author is now trying to compile a textbook on generalized political economics. Currently, due to the needs of the People's Daily, the first draft is being made public.
    The author hopes to compile something relatively detailed, relatively accessible, and somewhat connected to reality based on the level of Marxism-Leninism that can be understood at present. However, the author's ability and knowledge are limited, and errors and deficiencies in the views, methods, and materials of this book are feared to be unavoidable. The author earnestly hopes that general readers, political economists, and financial and economic workers will offer more criticisms and opinions.

    　　　　Chapter 1: Mode of Production
    The Object of Political Economics Research
    Political economics takes the mode of production as its research object. The mode of production is the unity of productive forces and relations of production.
    Section 1: Productive Forces
    The Necessity of Production
    We human beings live in society, and we cannot live without material means of life. The so-called material means of life are things like food, clothing, and utensils. These things are all produced by people. To put it simply: these things are all obtained or manufactured by people. That is to say, if people do not have these things, they must obtain them; if they are not suitable, they must be transformed by people to make them suitable and become material means of life for mankind.
    Production Factors and Their Importance
    But how to produce? What to rely on to produce? To produce, one must have both labor power and means of production.
    Labor power and means of production are two necessary and indispensable elements of production. Whether now, in the past, or in the future, as long as human society exists and continues, human beings must live. To live, one must engage in production; to produce, one must have these two elements of production. At the same time: since the beginning of human history, whether in history with written records or in history without written records, labor power and means of production have been two basic, necessary, and indispensable elements of production.

　　政治经济学教程绪论（１）
    王学文
  　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    前记：著者为了政治经济学的学习，现试编一个广义政治经济学的课本，目前因为人民日报的需要，先将初稿公之于世。
    著者希望以现在所能了解的马列主义水平，编一比较详细，比较通俗，多少能够联系实际的东西。但著者的能力与知识有限，这本书的观点，方法与材料等等方面，均恐难免错误和缺欠。著者恳切地希望一般读者，政治经济学者与财经工作者，多多批评与提出意见。

    　　　　内容提要
    第一章　生产方式
    政治经济学研究的对象—生产方式
    第一节　生产力
    生产的必要——生产要素与其重要性——劳动力——生产手段——生产力的两要素——生产力两要素对生产力的影响——自然的情况与变化对生产力的影响——人类依靠自身合目的性劳动改造自然使自然供给人类以物质生活资料——自然力必须经过人类的劳动才能成为劳动之自然的生产力——劳动对象有两部分及其对生产力的影响——劳动手段的意义——使用劳动手段进行劳动是人类劳动的特征——工具是人身自然器官的延长、扩大、增加、加强、和尖锐化——劳动手段的使用改良都是为了适合人类劳动的需要便利，都是为了提高生产力——生产的变更发展首先从劳动手段开始——劳动手段是社会经济时代划分的标志——工具发展到机器，生产力获得空前的发展——土地本身也是一种劳动手段——劳动对象与劳动手段合起来叫做生产手段——决定劳动力的因素——劳动力的量——劳动的熟练程度决定着劳动力的质——劳动强度与生产力的提高——劳动组织，协力与分工，也可以提高生产力——集团劳动及其好处——协力的史的发展—分工、复杂的协力可以大大提高生产力——分工的史的发展——分工的好处——协力与分工必须组织得好，才能提高生产力——劳动手段的发展也能引起劳动力的发展——劳动力的大小由什么决定的——生产力的大小是由什么来决定的——生产力是在历史上一定的生产关系下存在和发展着的。
    第二节　生产关系
    生产关系——狭义的生产关系，人们在生产过程中形成的关系——在自足自给经济下生产与分配消费的关系——在商品经济的社会里必须通过交换才能分配消费——广义的生产关系，生产诸关系——不同的社会有不同的生产关系，生产关系划分人类社会的历史时代——生产关系分为没有阶级的和有阶级的两种——一个时代的社会经济是由领导的与被领导的各种生产关系组成的——广义的过渡经济与狭义的过渡经济的特点。
    第三节　生产力与生产关系的统一——生产方式
    生产力与生产关系结合统一成为生产方式——生产方式，人们必需的物质生活资料的谋得方式——生产方式的发展变化首先基于生产力的发展变化——生产力与生产关系的关系——阶级社会里生产关系的变更发展是要经过斗争经过革命的—促进生产力发展的生产关系也是一种生产力——革命的阶级本身是一个伟大的生产力——革命的政权对生产力的提高发展有决定的意义与作用——人民解放军对新民主主义生产关系与生产力的建立发展，是起了重大的作用的——科学技术对生产力发展的影响——小结。
    　　　　第一章　生产方式
    政治经济学的研究对象
    政治经济学以生产方式为研究对象。生产方式是生产力与生产关系的统一。
    第一节　生产力
    生产的必要
    我们人类生存在社会里，非有物质生活资料不能生活下去，所谓物质生活资料，就是如象吃的、穿的、用的这一类东西。这些东西，都是人们生产出来的。通俗一点说：这些东西都是人们获得来的，或制造出来的。就是说这些东西，如果是人们没有的，就要由人们获得来，如果是不适用的，则要由人们加以改造才能适用，才能成为人类的物质生活资料。
    生产要素与其重要性
    但是怎样生产？依靠什么来生产？要生产就必须具有劳动力与生产手段二者。
    劳动力与生产手段是生产所必要的不可缺少的两个要素。不论现在、过去、以及将来，只要有人类社会的存在和持续下去，人类就要生活，要生活，就必须从事生产，要生产，就必须具备这两个生产的要素。同时：自有人类历史以来，不论有文字记载的历史，或者还没有文字记载的历史，劳动力与生产手段都是生产上两个基本的必要不可缺少的要素。（未完）
