Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 25th: Workers in major factories and enterprises in the Lüda area are now launching a production competition to fulfill the annual production tasks ahead of schedule in order to greet the great October Revolution Day. All the workers and staff of the Sino-Soviet Far East Electric Industry Light Bulb Factory proposed the call to complete the annual production task before the October Revolution Day as early as July. As of the 15th of this month, they have completed 97 percent of the annual production task. Since the celebration of the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference, the factory has maintained a record of producing 13,000 light bulbs per day (the past monthly average was around 10,000). The cement factory has now also completed 98 percent of the annual production task. The automobile factory has completed more than 80 percent of the October production task. Workers at the Dalian Ship Repair and Shipbuilding Factory and Soviet sailors are also engaged in friendly competitions. The production and saving competition of workers and staff of various units under the Dalian Railway Bureau has also achieved great results. For example, the freight car factory of the railway factory can now produce an average of ten freight cars per day (the average daily output in September was only 4.5 cars). As of the 18th of this month, 140 cars have been completed, exceeding the total output of September by three cars. In the past, workers in the 32nd Engineering Section of the Bureau could only complete 100 meters of track pressing per day with ten people, but now it has been increased to 150 meters. In addition, to celebrate the October Revolution Day, the people of Lüda launched a signature campaign of 500,000 people to pay tribute to Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong.

    争取提前完成全年生产任务
    【新华社大连二十五日电】旅大地区各大工厂、企业中的工人们，现正纷纷以提前完成全年生产任务的生产竞赛行动，来迎接伟大的十月革命节。中苏远东电业灯泡工厂的全体工友，早在七月间即提出十月革命节前完成全年生产任务的号召，截至本月十五日止，已完成全年生产任务百分之九十七。该厂自庆祝人民政协开幕时迄今，每日保持生产一万三千个灯泡的纪录（过去每月平均为一万个上下）。洋灰工厂现在也已完成全年生产任务百分之九十八。汽车工厂十月份生产任务已完成了百分之八十以上。大连修船造船厂工友和苏联海员们亦在进行友谊竞赛。大连铁路局所属各单位工友的生产节约竞赛，也收到很大效果。如铁路工厂货车厂，最近每天平均能出十辆货车（九月份每日平均仅做出四点五辆），本月十八日止已完成一百四十辆，比九月份全月产量已超出三辆。该局第三十二工务段工友，过去十个人压道一天仅能完成一百公尺，现已提高到一百五十公尺。此外，旅大人民为庆祝十月革命节，特发起五十万人的签名运动，向斯大林大元帅和毛泽东主席致敬。
