Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 26th. The congratulatory letter from all circles in Yan'an to Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's reply are as follows:

(I) Congratulatory Letter from Party, Government, Military, and Civilian Circles in Yan'an to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government:

Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government:

The establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China marks a new era in Chinese history, and also marks the beginning of the Chinese nation marching towards the broad road of independence, democracy, peace, unity, and prosperity. This is the first truly people's government in Chinese history. The people of all circles in Yan'an are celebrating this epoch-making great event with jubilation, and unanimously and firmly express their determination to struggle for the construction of northern Shaanxi under the leadership of the Central People's Government, and shout:

Long live the Central People's Government!
Long live Chairman Mao!
Long live the People's Republic of China!

Congratulated by all circles of the Party, Government, Military, and People of Yan'an.
October 2, 1949

(II) Chairman Mao's Reply to the Comrades in Yan'an and the Compatriots in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region:

Receiving your congratulatory letter has made me very happy and grateful. Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, from 1936 to 1948, were once the location of the CPC Central Committee and the general rear area for the Chinese people's liberation struggle. The people of Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have made great contributions to the people of the whole country. I celebrate the continued unity of the people of Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in rapidly restoring from the ravages of war and developing economic and cultural construction. I also hope that all revolutionary workers across the country will forever maintain the spirit of hard struggle that the workers in Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region possessed in the past ten years.

Mao Zedong
October 26, 1949
