To promote the exchange of materials internally and externally, Chahar Province values transportation construction, actively repairing roads and adding large numbers of transportation tools.
[Report from Zhangjiakou by this newspaper] Vigorously restoring and developing the transportation industry is one of the current urgent and arduous construction tasks in Chahar Province. Chahar Province is rich in agricultural products, especially in unique local products. Grain alone can be exported in the amount of 500 to 600 million jin annually. However, except for the Ping-Sui Railway line, where transportation is relatively convenient, transportation is very underdeveloped in vast areas of the province, making transport very difficult. The province has 23 highways of various sizes, with a total length of 3,000 kilometers, but two-thirds of them have been in disrepair for years and can only be used for short-distance transportation. The six counties in the northern Chahar area have a total of 18,306 animal-powered vehicles, of which cattle-drawn wooden-wheeled "dry flatbed carts" account for more than 63% (this type of cart can carry more than 300 jin and travels only 30 to 40 li per day). Due to transportation difficulties, the exchange of materials is not easy, and the difference between the exchange rates of agricultural products and industrial products in the interior is extremely disparate. For example, one needle can be exchanged for one egg, and two chi of red string can be exchanged for a large dou of naked oats. This exposes farmers to excessive intermediary exploitation.

After the liberation of major cities in North China, in order to adapt to the new urban and rural supply and demand relationship, a large amount of surplus agricultural products from Chahar Province are exported in exchange for the means of production and livelihood necessary for farmers. In February, the Chahar Transportation Company was officially established. The company has 39 trucks, 197 large rubber and iron-wheeled carts, and 411 mules and horses, specializing in round-trip transportation from northern Chahar and northern Yan areas to Zhangjiakou and other towns along the railway line; at the same time, private cars and long-distance porters were also organized. In the past six months, it has supplied about 200 million jin of food to Pingjin and exported some local products such as furs, mountain goods, and medicinal materials, in exchange for a large number of industrial products. In April, the Chahar Provincial Highway Bureau began to establish road maintenance stations on several main highway lines to repair roads. By August, a total of 2,464,400 jin of wages and rice had been spent, thus maintaining a total of 1,000 kilometers of rainy season transportation on six highways from Zhangjiakou to Shangdu, Duolun, Datong, Nankou, from Xuanhua to Yuxian, and from Datong to Fengzhen. These are all achievements gained through great efforts. In the future, the repair of highways will be carried out with emphasis based on the urgency of needs, and the spirit of relying on the masses will be implemented. Voluntary labor will be implemented, and the masses will be organized to use their slack farming season to repair roads in sections under contract. Bridges, culverts, and other more technical projects will be contracted out or managed by the government, and the expenses will be paid by the national treasury.

In terms of increasing transportation capacity, the Chahar Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative plans to manufacture 4,193 animal-powered wooden carts in the second half of the year, and the northern Chahar area plans to add 3,500 new carts. In addition, supply and marketing cooperatives in Zhangbei, Xuanhua, Shangdu, and Huaian counties and cities have also placed orders for 1,900 animal-powered wooden carts. It has been decided that the vehicle manufacturing funds will be resolved through cooperative loans; the sale of vehicles will be divided into two types: cash sales and loaning vehicles with agricultural products recovered regularly. In order to improve transportation capacity, the Chahar Provincial Transportation Company decided to convert all of its existing iron-wheeled carts into rubber-wheeled carts, convert some of its cars to burn charcoal, and accurately calculate the consumption of manpower and materials to reduce costs. At the same time, it will vigorously organize and reward private transportation capacity to actively participate in strengthening material exchange. (Lü Guangming)

### 促进内外物资交流  察省重视交通建设　积极整修公路大量添置运输工具

　　促进内外物资交流
    察省重视交通建设
  　积极整修公路大量添置运输工具
    【本报张家口专讯】大力恢复与发展交通运输事业，是察哈尔省当前急迫而艰巨的建设任务之一。察省农产丰富，特产尤多，仅粮食一项，每年即可输出五六亿斤。而全省除平绥沿线运输较便利外，广大地区交通甚不发达，运输非常困难；全省虽有大小公路二十三条，全长三千公里，但其中三分之二因年久失修，目前只能作短途运输。察北区六个县共有畜力车一万八千三百零六辆，其中牛拖木轮“旱板车”即占百分之六十三强（该车载重三百余斤，日行仅三、四十里）。由于运输困难，物资交流不易，内地农产品与工业品之交换差额异常悬殊，如：一个针可换一个鸡蛋，二尺红头绳能换一大斗莜麦；这样使农民受着过高的中间剥削。
    华北各大城市解放后，为适应新的城乡供求关系，大量输出察省农业剩余生产品，换取农民所必需的生产与生活资料。二月间，察哈尔运输公司正式成立。该公司有载重汽车三十九辆，胶、铁轮大车一百九十七辆，骡马四百十一头，专从察北、雁北向张家口等铁路沿线城镇往返运输；同时并组织了私营汽车及长途脚户，半年来计供应平津食粮约两万万斤，输出特产皮毛、山货、药材等一部，换回了大批工业品。四月间，察省公路局开始在几条公路干线上成立养路站，进行整修公路，至八月份共开支工资米达二百四十六万四千余斤，因而维持了从张家口到商都、多伦、大同、南口，从宣化到蔚县，从大同到丰镇等六条公路总长一千公里的雨季交通。这些都是经过很大努力而获得的成绩。今后关于公路的修建，拟根据需要之缓急，有重点的进行整修，并将贯彻依靠群众的精神，实行义务劳动，组织群众利用农闲，分段包修，凡桥梁，涵洞及技术性较大的工程，则采取包工或政府自办的方法，经费由国库开支。
    在增强运输力方面，察哈尔省供销合作社下半年计划制造畜力木车四千一百九十三辆，察北区拟增加新车三千五百辆，此外如张北、宣化、商都、怀安等县市供销社并分别订造畜力木车一千九百辆的供销合同。造车资金决定由合作社贷款解决；车的出售则分现款出售与贷车定期收回农产品两种。察省运输公司为提高运输力，决定将原有之铁轮大车全部改装为胶轮大车，一部汽车改燃木炭，并精确计算人、物力消耗，以减低成本。同时并将以大力组织与奖励私营运输力积极参加，以加强物资交流。　　　　　　　　　　（吕光明）
