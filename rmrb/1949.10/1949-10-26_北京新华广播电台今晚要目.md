    In yesterday's People's Daily, page four, in the news about the first autumn sports meeting of the North China Military Region, the opening date "27th" was a mistake for "28th". We did not clarify the date and should review this. Also, in the same news item, "the content of this conference" should be "the content of this grand dance". We hereby correct this as well.

　  市府新闻处
    昨日人民日报四版刊载华北军区首次秋季运动会消息中之开幕日期，“二十七日”系“二十八日”之误，我们没把日期弄清，应该检讨。又同一消息内“此次大会的内容”，应是“这个大舞蹈的内容”，特此一并更正。
