　　Conversation with Simonov
　　Furnace
　　Like old friends who haven't seen each other for years, Chinese and Soviet friends were chatting in twos and threes. A tall Soviet man sat quietly in a corner, smoking his pipe and examining each Chinese friend. A brown striped suit, a Chairman Mao gold badge pinned to his lapel, paired with a red tie, was particularly eye-catching. Several Chinese comrades said he was Simonov, the author of "Days and Nights."
　　Although we had never met Simonov, "Days and Nights" was very familiar to us. I happily told Comrade Li Tianhuan, the political commissar of our corps, and he happily came with me to sit beside him.
　　"Simonov!" We all shook hands with him cordially.
　　"Hello!" He nodded and greeted us with a smile.
　　Beneath his high, broad forehead were thick eyebrows. A pipe was clenched beneath his dense mustache. It was as if we had met somewhere before.
　　"Your novel is very popular in our People's Liberation Army!" Hearing that he could speak a few simple Chinese words, Political Commissar Li assumed that he could understand us and expressed the feelings of our vast number of commanders and fighters very frankly.
　　He listened carefully to Political Commissar Li for three times and thought for a long while, then smiled, shrugged his shoulders and said in stiff Chinese: "Don't—understand!"
　　Later, he broke the deadlock himself and asked a translator comrade to come. Political Commissar Li repeated his original words and asked her to translate them. After hearing this, Simonov smiled slightly: "Thank you, I never thought it would be spread to China!" After mutual translation, our feelings were directly connected.
　　"Our People's Liberation Army loves to read this novel, because it is not only a literary work, but also a tactical work," Political Commissar Li said boldly.
　　"During the war, I was not only a writer, but also a major general brigade commander. At that time, I was in Stalingrad."
　　"Major General Brigade Commander!" Everyone was surprised, repeating his words, no wonder he wrote so truthfully and comprehensively.
　　Seeing that we were talking so enthusiastically, Comrade Song Luoqi, Deputy Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of Tianjin Municipal People's Government, Comrade Xu Jianguo, Director of the Public Security Bureau, and two Soviet friends also moved their chairs and sat in front of us.
　　Then he narrated his experiences in the Soviet Union's Great Patriotic War, saying: "In that war, we had almost a thousand writers working in the army. Among them, three hundred people gloriously sacrificed! Some of our war correspondents were officers. They had received military training before the war. I had received one year of military training before the war."
　　His experience made everyone listen with great interest. One comrade mistakenly remembered that he had participated in the battle in Leningrad during the war, and he immediately corrected him, saying: "No, I am a native of Leningrad." He also told us that ten years ago, he had participated in the battle at Nomonhan.
　　Before he finished his story, someone shifted the topic to asking about the recent situation of the author of "Fear and Courage," at first he didn't know what the original Russian name of "Fear and Courage" was. This stumped us again: we didn't understand Russian, and we forgot the author's name. Later, he asked about the protagonist of the novel, and we suddenly remembered Panfilov's division commander.
　　"Oh! Panfilov's division commander!" He then talked about the defense of the outskirts of Moscow from Panfilov's division commander, saying that Panfilov's division commander had already sacrificed, and the author Bek was still alive, and he was writing a novel. When fighting on the outskirts of Moscow, many intellectuals participated in the army, and Bek was one of them, and he depicted the war very realistically.
　　We told him that "Fear and Courage" was very popular in the People's Liberation Army. Because it has played a very important role in our combat bravery, love for soldiers on the battlefield, and careful planning of battles, we use it as a reader for our commanders. Every commander loves to read it.
　　Simonov was very happy to hear our narration, and a pleasant smile constantly appeared on his face. He also told us that the author of "Immortal People" is now writing a novel about the Battle of Stalingrad, the content is very interesting, but it has not yet been published. Filokina has also drawn a picture album of the Battle of Stalingrad, from which you can see the whole picture of that battle.
　　The scope of our translation was very wide, talking about his past work, talking about the outstanding Soviet commanders Zhukov and Vasilevsky, talking about my position. When we talked about Marshal Zhukov, who had been his superior, Political Commissar Li raised a big thumb and said: "Marshal Zhukov fought well!" Several Soviet friends in the audience smiled and talked, learning from his appearance, raising their left thumb, pressing down on the finger with their right hand, and then using the five fingers of their right hand to knead in the distance above.
　　The translator comrade told us: "The Soviet custom is like this: 'Especially good' is to raise a big thumb and then add a pinch, meaning that adding a little salt, the taste will be very good!" Everyone laughed when they heard this. Learning from their appearance, they burst into laughter.
　　When talking about his feelings about coming to New China, he said that he really hoped to come to New China, so he was willing to come. Along the way, friends from New China warmly welcomed them, and he sincerely thanked them. In particular, he hoped to see the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Tomorrow he will be able to see the Chinese People's Liberation Army and shake hands with the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Really, for a long time, we have had the same mood as him, wanting to shake hands tightly with our close Soviet comrades.
　　At this time, a Soviet friend opposite me stretched out a warm hand to Comrade Li Tianhuan, Comrade Li Tianhuan held it tightly, his face full of smiles, staring at him. The Soviet friend said loudly: "Now I am shaking hands with his representative!" The people sitting around this small circle smiled and applauded! It turned out that the Soviet friend was the artist Fenogolov, who had won the Stalin Prize.
　　Our laughter attracted many people, the circle of people thickened, and some squeezed two people on one chair.
　　We talked about the Long March of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army from the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and he said: They know every detail of the Long March very well. He said: "We call the Long March of the Chinese Red Army the 'Great Long March', because only such a great people can complete such a Long March! Only such a great leader as Chairman Mao can realize such a great Long March!"
　　Our great Soviet comrades praised us like this, which makes us feel inspired; and it is worthy of pride for every people's fighter under his leadership to have such a great people's leader as Chairman Mao! Especially Comrade Li Tianhuan, who personally participated in the Long March, felt even more glorious! Everyone introduced his glorious history to these great Soviet comrades.
　　"Are there also many writers in China who participate in the war, like us?" Fenogolov said.
　　"Yes."
　　"We have many Soviet musicians and writers who reflect the Soviet Union's war and construction, and you can see the Soviet Union's thirty-year history from their works. Because these war works reflect the heroic deeds of defending the motherland, they are very popular among the Soviet people."
　　Political Commissar Li said: "We also have many writers who participated in the war, and many people gloriously sacrificed for the war. But our work in this area is still very poor, and we have to learn from the Soviet Union!"
　　"When we were fighting in Stalingrad, there was a art writer working group, they wrote the materials they got in the war into works. These war works can be reflected in the National Exhibition Hall, if we are not doing well enough now, we should work hard, don't lose these things, because they are very precious."
　　Simonov, who had been smoking his pipe in silence for a while, also joined in: "Each of our corps has a newspaper, which can reflect the works of writers. I don't know how you are?"
　　Political Commissar Li introduced the troop entertainment activities in the Chinese People's Liberation Army to them: "Now each of our corps, each army, and each division has a cultural troupe organization, and there are propaganda teams in the troupe; each of our armies has its own newspaper, and the corps also has publications. The news reporters and photography reporters of the troops serve these newspapers. They report the heroic deeds of the battle during the battle, and report the learning situation of military, political and cultural affairs during training."
　　Fenogolov said: "This work is very necessary, very correct, but it is also very necessary to collect historical materials."
　　Simonov added to introduce their situation: "Now each of our corps is writing the history of their corps, so that every new soldier understands the historical tradition of his corps."
　　"Now our war is not over yet, we still have to prepare for battle, conduct training, so we haven't done this yet," Comrade Li Tianhuan said.
　　"However, this work should start now. These works should be done when the memory is still fresh, don't wait until the time when you forget it!" Fenogolov said sincerely to us.
　　"Very right!" Comrade Li Tianhuan nodded repeatedly.
　　Fenogolov then gave us an example, saying: "Before, in Stalingrad, there were three Greek writers, they wrote the story of the Cossack cavalry in the Don River basin into a novel, and as a result, he wrote down a fact in the history at that time, which is very useful for the founding history of the Soviet Union."
　　Just as we were talking with great interest, the host invited them to eat, and our happy talk had to be interrupted.

　　和西蒙诺夫的谈话
    熔炉
    象多年未见的老友一样，中苏两国友人三三两两的在交谈着。一个高大的苏联人却静静地坐着在一个角落里，衔着烟斗端详每一个中国友人。咖啡色的条布西装，襟头别了一个毛主席的金章，配上红色的领带，特别惹人注目。好些中国同志说他就是“日日夜夜”的作者西蒙诺夫。
    西蒙诺夫虽然未曾会过面：但“日日夜夜”和我们却是很熟谂的。我高兴的告诉了我们兵团的政治委员李天焕同志，他也兴高彩烈地和我一块到他身边坐下来了。
    “西蒙诺夫！”我们都和他亲切地握一握手。
    “好！”他微笑地和我们点头招呼。
    高阔的前额下面，两道粗浓的眉毛。稠密的胡髭下边衔着一个烟斗。好象我们在什么地方见过面似的。
    “你的小说在我们解放军里很受欢迎啊！”听他能说一两句简单的中国话，李政委就以为他能够听懂我们的话了，很率直地就向他表示我们广大指战员的心情。
    他仔细地听李政委说了三遍，想了半晌，还是微笑地耸耸肩膀说一句生硬的中国话：“不——懂！”
    后来还是他打破了这僵局，请一个翻译的同志来了。李政委把他原话再讲一遍，请她作一个翻译。西蒙诺夫听到以后，微微的笑了：“谢谢你，我开始想不到它会传到中国来！”经过互相翻译，我们的感情从此直接打通了。
    “我们解放军都很爱读这本小说，因为它不独是文艺的著作，而且是战术的著作。”李政委大胆的谈起来了。
    “在战争的时候，我不独是作家，而且是一个少将旅长。那时我在斯大林格勒。”
    “少将旅长！”大家都很惊讶，重复着他这一句话，怪不得他写得这样真切全面。
    看到我们谈得这样热闹，天津市人民政府民政局副局长宋罗歧同志、公安局长许建国同志，和两个苏联朋友也搬了椅子坐到我们面前了。
    接着他叙述他在苏联伟大的卫国战争的经历说：“在那次战争中，我们差不多有一千作家在军队里工作。其中有三百个人光荣牺牲了！我们有些战地记者是军官。他们在战前就受过军事训练。我在战前就受过一年军训。”
    他的经历使得大家听得津津有味。有个同志错记了他战时在列宁格勒参加战斗，他马上纠正说：“不，我是列宁格勒的生人。”他还告诉我们，十年前，他在诺门坎参加过战斗。
    没有谈完他的故事，旁人把话题转到问他“恐惧与无畏”的作者近况上去了，开头他不知道“恐惧与无畏”的俄文原名是什么。这一下又把我们难住了：俄文我们不懂得，作者名字忘记了。后来他问到小说的主角，我们才猛然想起潘菲洛夫师团长。
    “噢！潘菲洛夫师团长吗！”他就从潘菲洛夫师团长谈到莫斯科外围的保卫战，他说潘菲洛夫师团长已经牺牲了，作者别克还活着，他现在正创作小说。在莫斯科外围作战时，有许多知识分子参加部队，别克就是其中的一个，他描写战争很逼真。
    我们告诉他，“恐惧与无畏”在解放军中很受欢迎。因为它对我们作战的勇敢、战场爱兵以及战斗的精心计划所起的作用是非常大的，所以我们把它作为我们指挥员的读本。每个指挥员都很喜爱的读了它。
    西蒙诺夫听到我们的叙述非常高兴，脸孔不断现出愉快的笑容。他又告诉我们“不朽的人民”的作者，现在正写着一本斯大林格勒保卫战的小说，内容很有趣，现在还没有出版，菲洛基娜也画了斯大林格勒之战的画册，从那本画册里可以看出那次战役的全貌。
    我们译的范围非常广泛，谈到他过去的工作，谈到苏联卓著的统帅朱可夫、华西列夫斯基，谈到我的职务。当我们谈到曾当过他的上司的朱可夫元帅的时候，李政委翘起一个大姆指说：“朱可夫元帅打得好！”在座几个苏联朋友都笑着交谈，学着他的样子，翘起左手的大姆指，右手在指头上一按，再用右手五个指头在远上方掇捏。
    翻译的同志告诉我们说：“苏联的习惯是这样的：‘特别好’是翘起一个大姆指再加一捏，意思是说，加一点盐，味道就很好了！”大家一听，都乐了。学着他们的样子，哄然大笑起来。
    谈到他到新中国的感想时，他说，他很希望能够来到新中国，所以愿意来。一路上新中国的朋友都很热烈的欢迎他们，他衷心的感谢。特别是他希望见到中国人民解放军。明天他就可以见到中国人民解放军，可以和中国人民解放军的战士握一握手了。真的，我们许久以来，就和他的心情一样，想和亲密的苏联战友们紧紧的握一握手了。
    这时，我对面一个苏联朋友向李天焕同志伸出热情的大手来，李天焕同志紧紧的握着了他，洋溢着满脸的笑容，注视着他。苏联朋友高声的说：“现在我就和他的代表握手了！”环绕这个小圈子坐着的人们都笑着鼓掌了！原来那位苏联朋友是曾荣获斯大林奖金的艺术家费诺格洛夫。
    我们的欢笑引来了许多人，人圈子加厚了，有些挤得两个人坐在一个椅子上。
    我们从中国人民解放军谈到中国工农红军的长征，他说：他们对长征的每一个细节都知得很清楚。他说：“我们叫中国红军的长征作‘伟大的长征’，因为只有这样伟大的人民才能完成这样的长征！只有毛主席这样伟大的领导，才能实现这样伟大的长征！”
    我们伟大的苏联战友这样称赞我们，是使我们感奋的；而且我们有毛主席这样伟大的人民领袖，是值得我们每个在他领导下的人民战士骄傲的！特别是亲身参加了长征的李天焕同志，更是觉得光荣了！大家都把他的光荣的历史介绍给这些伟大的苏联战友们。
    “中国是否也有很多作家参加战争，象我们一样呢？”费诺格洛夫说。
    “一样。”
    “我们有许多苏联音乐家和作家把苏联的战争和建设反映出来，从他们的作品里可以看出苏联三十年的历史。因为这些战争经过作品把保卫祖国的英雄事迹反映出来，所以很受苏联人民的欢迎。”
    李政委说：“我们也有很多作家参加战争，而且有许多人为战争光荣牺牲了。但我们这方面工作作得还很差，我们得向苏联学习！”
    “我们在斯大林格勒作战的时候，有一个艺术作家工作团，他们把在战争里所得的材料，写成作品。这些战争中的作品可以在国家陈列馆里反映出来，如果我们现在作得还不够，我们应很好的努力，不要把这些东西丧失了，因为他是很宝贵的东西。”
    抽着烟斗沉默了一会的西蒙诺夫也参加意见了：“我们每个兵团都有一个报纸，可以把作家的作品反映出来。不晓得你们怎样呢？”
    李政委就把中国人民解放军里的部队文娱活动介绍给他们说：“现在我们每个兵团、每个军、每个师都有文工团的组织，团队里还有宣传队；我们每个军都有部队自己出的报纸，兵团还有刊物，部队的新闻记者和摄影记者，就为这些报纸服务，他们在战斗的时候报导当时战斗的英雄事迹，练兵的时候报导军事、政治、文化的学习情况。”
    费诺格洛夫说：“这方面的工作是很需要的，很对的，但还很需要搜集历史的材料。”
    西蒙诺夫补充介绍他们的情况说：“现在我们每个兵团都在写他们每个兵团的历史，使得每个新来的战士，都懂得他的兵团的历史传统。”
    “现在我们的战争还有没完结，我们还得准备战斗，进行练兵，所以我们现在还没有这样作。”李天焕同志说。
    “不过，现在这个工作应该开始了。这些工作应该在记忆犹新的时间去作，不要等忘记了的时间再去作啊！”费诺格洛夫诚恳的对我们说。
    “很对！”李天焕同志连连的点头。
    费诺格洛夫接着给我们举了一个例子说：“以前，在斯大林格勒有三个希腊作家，他们把顿河流域的哥萨克骑兵的故事写成小说，结果他把当时历史中一段事实写下来了，对于苏联的建国历史是很有用的。”
    正谈得津津有味的时候，主人请他们去吃饭，我们的欢谈只好中断了。
