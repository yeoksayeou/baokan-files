【Beijing News】The Beijing Military Control Commission has recently issued a proclamation regarding the handling of rural debt issues in the municipality's jurisdiction. This proclamation will be forwarded by the Municipal Government's Suburban Work Committee to all districts in the suburbs and posted in all natural villages within days. The proclamation stipulates the following three handling methods:

　　1. Debts of a usurious nature owed by the working people to landlords and rich peasants before the land reform are completely abolished; however, debts between peasants, business transactions, and other friendly loans are still considered valid.

　　2. Land and property mortgaged by peasants to landlords, rich peasants, and usurers due to debt shall be unconditionally returned to the peasants.

　　3. Lending relationships after the land reform are not subject to abolition, and interest rates shall be agreed upon by both parties.
