　　Introduction to Beijing Speech Meetings
    Zheng Zhong

Speech meetings are a very good form of propaganda and education. Currently, several frequently held speech meetings in Beijing have achieved very good results, and a brief introduction is given below.

    　　　　China Youth Speech Meeting

The China Youth Speech Meeting is sponsored by the "China Youth Society" of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. The target audience is young workers, students, teachers, government cadres, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and citizens in the city. It is held every Sunday morning. From June 28th to the present, it has been held eleven times, with an audience of over 21,500 people, making it the speech meeting with the largest audience in Beijing. It has three major characteristics: First, it has good organizational work and a mass base: the Communist Youth League branches of various government agencies, factories, and schools organize League members to attend collectively; it promptly improves according to the opinions and requirements of the audience regarding the speech meeting. In addition, fifty liaison officers were organized in twenty-eight key middle schools in the five districts of the city, divided into four groups for bicycle parking, registration, venue management, and recording, to participate in the venue service work. Their spirit of service has been praised by the vast audience. Second, the content of the speeches focuses on issues closely related to youth, such as learning and youth self-cultivation. Each topic is based on everyone's feedback and requirements, and the most appropriate experts are invited to speak: for example, Chen Jiakang spoke on "How Youth Understand the World," Qian Junrui spoke on "New Patriotism," Xiao San spoke on "Youth Learning Issues," Ding Ling spoke on "On the Road of Progress," and Wu Lengxi spoke on "The White Paper Issue," all of which are very pressing and important issues. On September 4th, when Liu Ningyi spoke on "Striving for World Democratic Peace," the audience reached 6,984 people, and the enthusiastic situation was evident. The third characteristic is the lively atmosphere of the venue: according to everyone's requirements, the China Youth Art Theater is invited to perform small programs before and after the speeches, such as the recently performed "Glorious Lamp," "Joining the Army," and "Marching Dance," all of which have been warmly welcomed, adjusting everyone's spirits and conducting ideological education. In the future, it is also planned to organize various factories and schools to participate in performances, driving their recreational activities. In addition, temporary bookstores for "China Youth" and "Beiping Youth" are set up in the venue to facilitate audience purchases. Before each speech meeting, the news is announced in the newspaper, but every Saturday, calls from various places still come to inquire about the speaker and topic. After the speeches, many audience members enthusiastically write letters to reflect their opinions. It can be seen that the vast audience is very concerned about this speech meeting.

    　　　　New Democracy Lecture Series

Sponsored by the YMCA, the location is the YMCA Gymnasium on East Dan Mishi Street. It is held every Wednesday and Saturday at 7:00 PM. The target audience is middle school students, vocational youth, business people, and citizens. Each time, the attendance ranges from one or two hundred people to seven or eight hundred people. The method of attracting the audience is to print and post advertisements, publicize in front of the door, and announce in the newspaper. The content of the speeches is based on the current situation and the requirements of the youth, and experts are invited to decide on special topics. After the speeches, the audience can submit questions in writing and ask the speakers to answer them on the spot. From April 6th, when Shen Junru was invited to speak on "The People's Peace," to October 8th, a total of forty-two sessions have been held. In addition to the various political, economic, and cultural policies of New Democracy, Huang Yanpei was also invited to speak on "Religion under New Democracy," Tan Pingshan spoke on "A New Outlook on Life," Li Dequan spoke on "Women in New China," Deng Chumin spoke on "Impressions of the World Peace Congress," Qian Sanqiang spoke on "A Casual Talk on Atomic Nuclear Energy," People's Political Consultative Conference representative Zhao Puchu spoke on "Buddhism in the New Era," as well as introductions to the Soviet Union by Guo Moruo, Zheng Zhenduo, Cao Yu, and Mao Dun. In particular, on the day Mao Dun spoke on "The Life of the Soviet People," the upstairs and downstairs were packed, but the audience persisted until the meeting ended, which shows the great concern of the vast people for the Soviet Union. The shortcoming of this lecture series is the lack of organizational work, the lack of a fixed audience, and the lack of a systematic approach to the topics. It is planned to overcome this deficiency in the near future by conducting systematic lectures on psychology, hygiene, marriage, career, and reading methods.

    　　　　New Knowledge Symposium

There is a defined organization, which is organized by the Beijing branch of the Democratic National Construction Association, with members of the association as the primary target audience, and people from economic and cultural departments are also welcome to attend. Each time, the audience ranges from ninety to one or two hundred people. The location is the European and American Students Association on South Hanyan Street. The topics are notified in the newspaper in addition to sending letters. The content includes politics, current affairs, finance and economics, industrial and commercial policies, and labor-management issues. Since its opening in March, thirty-eight symposiums, lecture meetings, and discussion meetings have been held. The speakers are mostly economists and democratic figures from the industrial sector, such as Ma Yinchu, Zhang Naiqi, Huang Yanpei, Zheng Chumin, Sun Qimeng, Yu Huancheng, Hu Ziying, and Shi Fuliang. Internally, they call this lecture meeting a "political learning meeting" and a "business learning meeting," mainly to enable the national bourgeoisie to understand the economic policies of New Democracy and work together to develop production and prosper the economy. Therefore, they are more hoping that responsible cadres from the Party, government, and financial departments will make special reports. For example, Hu Sheng's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" and Liang Yao of the North China Cooperative General Society's "Production and Sales Cooperation, Urban-Rural Mutual Assistance" were welcomed by the audience.

　　京市讲演会介绍
    郑重
    讲演会，是一种很好的宣传教育形式。目前北京市几个经常举行的讲演会，已收到很好的效果，今作简单介绍。
    　　　　中国青年讲演会
    中国青年讲演会是青年团中央宣传部“中国青年社”所主办的。对象是全市的青年工人、学生、教职员、机关干部、解放军和市民。每星期日上午举行。从六月二十八日到现在，共举行了十一次，听众达二万一千五百余人，是京市听众最多的一个讲演会。它有三大特色：第一、有很好的组织工作及群众基础：通过各机关、工厂、学校的青年团支部，组织团员集体到会；根据听众对讲演会的意见和要求，及时改进。并在城内五个区二十八个重点中学，组织了五十个联络员，分成存车、签到、会场、记录四组，参加会场服务工作。他们的服务精神，得到广大听众的赞许。第二、讲演的内容注意联系青年切身问题，如学习问题、青年修养等。每次讲题都根据大家的反映和要求，请最适当的专家来讲：如陈家康讲“青年怎样认识世界”，钱俊瑞讲“新爱国主义”，萧三讲“青年学习问题”，丁玲讲“在前进的路上”，吴冷西讲“白皮书问题”都是很迫切很重要的问题。九月四日刘宁一讲“为世界民主和平而奋斗”时，到会听众六千九百八十四人，其热烈情况可见一般。第三个特点是会场活跃：根据大家的要求，邀请中国青年艺术剧院在讲前讲后表演小型节目，如最近演出的“光荣灯”、“参军”、“进军舞”等，都受到热烈欢迎，调剂了大家的精神，又进行了思想教育。今后还打算组织各工厂学校参加演出，带动他们的文娱活动。此外并在会场内设有“中国青年”和“北平青年”临时售书处，便利听众购买。每次讲演会举行前都在报纸上公布消息，但每到星期六各处仍纷纷来电话询问主讲人和讲题。讲演完了以后，不少的听众还热情的写信来反映意见。可见广大听众都很关心这个讲演会。
    　　　　新民主主义讲座
    由基督教青年会主办，地点在东单米市大街青年会体育馆。每星期三、六下午七时举行。对象是中学学生、职业青年、工商界人士及市民。每次到会从一、二百人到七、八百人。号召听众的办法是印贴广告、门前公布及报纸公布。讲演的内容，根据当前的形势和青年要求，邀请专家决定专题，讲后听众可用文字提问题请讲演人当场回答。从四月六日开始请沈钧儒讲“人民的和平”，到十月八日已共举行了四十二次。讲演内容除了新民主主义的政治、经济、文化各种政策之外，还请黄炎培讲过一次“新民主主义下的宗教”，谭平山讲“新人生观”，李德全讲“新中国的妇女”，邓初民讲“世界拥护和平大会的观感”，钱三强讲“漫谈原子核能”，人民政协代表赵朴初讲“新时代的佛教”以及郭沫若、郑振铎、曹禺、茅盾的苏联介绍。特别是茅盾讲“苏联人民的生活”那天，楼上楼下挤了个水泄不通，但听众一直坚持到会散，可见广大人民对苏联之关切。这个讲座的缺点是缺少组织工作，没有固定的听众，讲的东西没有系统。近拟克服此缺陷，进行心理、卫生、婚姻、职业、读书方法等方面的有系统的讲演。
    　　　　新知识座谈会
    有定型的组织，由民主建国会北京市分会举办，以该会会员为基本对象，也欢迎经济部门及文化部门人士参加听讲。每次听众由九十人到一二百人，地点在南河沿欧美同学会，讲题除发信外并在报纸上通知。内容为政治、时事、财政经济、工商业政策及劳资问题等。自三月份开办以来已举行座谈会、讲演会及讨论会三十八次。主讲人多为经济学家及产业界民主人士，如马寅初、章乃器、黄炎培、郑初民、孙起孟、俞寰澄、胡子婴、施复亮等。他们内部把这讲演会叫作“政治学习会”和“业务学习会”，主要为了使民族资产阶级能明了新民主主义的经济政策，共同为发展生产繁荣经济而努力。所以他们更希望党、政、财经各部门负责干部去作专题报告。如胡绳讲的“论人民民主专政”和华北合作总社梁耀讲的“产销合作，城乡互助”，都受到听众欢迎。
