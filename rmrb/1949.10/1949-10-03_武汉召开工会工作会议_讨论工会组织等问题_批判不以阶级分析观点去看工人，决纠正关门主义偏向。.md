Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 28th: The Wuhan Trade Union Work Conference, which opened here on the 17th of this month, concluded on the 24th after a thorough discussion of three major topics: trade union organization, democratic management of public enterprises, and labor-management relations in private enterprises. The conference was attended by 284 people, including Wuhan trade union work cadres, worker representatives, and administrative leaders of various public enterprises; more than 400 people from various factories, government offices, and organizations attended as observers. Party, government, and military organs in Central China and Wuhan also sent representatives to participate. In addition to conveying and discussing the resolutions of the National Trade Union Work Conference, the conference invited Deng Zihui, Chairman of the Central Plains Provisional People's Government, and Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, to make special policy reports, enabling Wuhan trade union work cadres to have a clearer understanding of the current tasks and work guidelines of the workers' movement.

In terms of trade union organization, the conference reviewed that in the past, trade unions had no specific regulations on the conditions and procedures for workers to join the union, or the regulations were too strict, resulting in a general tendency of closed-doorism. For example, the Hankou Branch of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, which has more than 7,000 employees, did not even organize a workers' representative meeting in three full months of work. At the same time, some factories that had established trade union preparatory committees had not developed members for a long time because the requirements for workers to join the trade union were too high. In addition, most cadres generally showed insufficient understanding of the fact that the working class is the most revolutionary class. They did not view workers from the perspective of class analysis. Instead, when they saw that some workers ate or dressed better than peasants, they said that the workers were living corruptly. When they saw that some workers had been forced to join the Kuomintang or the Three People's Principles Youth League in the past, they suspected that these workers were politically unreliable. These views, which do not look at the revolutionary essence of the working class, are clearly wrong. After repeated discussions on the mass character and class character of trade unions, everyone had a clearer understanding of the line of trade union organization and resolved to correct the tendency of closed-doorism.

When discussing the democratic management of public enterprises, many administrative work cadres and trade union work cadres of public factories deeply reviewed the undemocratic style of doing everything for others in the past. For example, the administrative负责人负责人负责人 of the Wuhan Telecommunications Administration explained in his review at the meeting that in the past, major issues related to the vital interests of workers, such as adjusting wages, streamlining personnel, and abolishing unreasonable benefits, had not been properly discussed with the workers and trade union work groups. Some cadres still believed that it was difficult to implement democratic management during the period of military control and that it was worth considering. They did not understand that military control was to strictly control the enemy, and that democracy should be promoted as much as possible for the people, especially the workers; they did not understand that after the workers' democracy was promoted, it would be more conducive to strictly controlling the enemy.

When discussing labor-management issues, the representatives at the meeting believed that the attitude of trade union work towards both labor and management in private enterprises in the past was not clear enough. At the meeting, several cadres reviewed the past tendency of wavering from left to right in their work. Finally, Zhao Min, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Central China Federation of Trade Unions, made a summary at the meeting and arranged the trade union work for the next three months. Zhao Min called on all the cadres present to respond to the resolutions of the National Trade Union Work Conference and basically organize all the workers in Wuhan in about one year.

　　武汉召开工会工作会议
  　讨论工会组织等问题
    批判不以阶级分析观点去看工人，决纠正关门主义偏向。
    【新华社汉口二十八日电】本月十七日在此举行的武汉市工会工作会议，在详尽讨论了工会组织、公营企业管理民主化、私营企业劳资关系三大议题之后，已于二十四日结束。出席会议者有武汉工会工作干部、职工代表和各公营企业行政负责人员等二百八十四人；各工厂、机关、团体列席者四百余人。华中和武汉的党、政、军各机关也都派有代表参加。会议除了传达和讨论全国工会工作会议的决议之外，已分别邀请中原临时人民政府主席邓子恢、中共武汉市委会书记张平化等作了政策性的专题报告，使武汉工会工作的干部对于目前工人运动的任务和工作方针，有了较为明确的认识。在工会组织方面，会议检讨出过去工会对于职工入会条件、入会手续等没有具体规定，或者规定过严，以致普遍产生了关门主义的偏向。如拥有七千余员工的郑州区铁路局汉口分局，在整整三个月的工作中，连职工代表会都没有组织起来。同时，有些已成立工会筹备会的工厂，也因为对于工人参加工会的条件要求太高，长久没有发展会员。此外，一般干部对于工人阶级是最革命的阶级，也普遍表现出认识不足。他们不是以阶级分析的观点去看工人，而是看见有些工人比农民吃得好些或是穿得好些，就说工人们生活腐化。他们看到有些工人过去被迫参加国民党、三青团，就怀疑这些工人政治上不可靠。这些不从工人阶级革命的本质上去看问题的观点，显然是不对的。会议在反复讨论了工会的群众性与阶级性后，大家对于工会组织的路线问题，有了较为明确的认识，并决心纠正关门主义的偏向。会议在讨论公营企业管理民主化时，许多公营工厂的行政工作干部与工会工作干部，都深刻地检讨了过去包办代替的不民主作风。例如，武汉电讯管理局行政负责人在会上检讨时，说明过去对于调整工资、精简人员、取消不合理福利等等有关工人切身利害的重大问题，都没有和工人群众、工会工作组很好地商量过。有些干部则对于在军事管制时期实行管理民主化，尚认为有困难，值得考虑。他们不了解军事管制是对敌人要实行严厉的管制，对人民尤其是工人则应该尽量发扬民主；没有了解工人的民主得到发扬以后，更有助于严格地管制敌人。会议在讨论劳资问题时，与会代表认为过去工会工作对私营企业劳资双方态度是不够明确的。在会上，好几个干部检讨了过去工作中左右摇摆的偏向。最后，华中总工会筹委会主任赵敏在会上作了总结，并布置了今后三个月的工会工作。赵敏号召全体到会干部响应全国工会工作会议的决议，在一年左右把全武汉的工人基本上组织起来。
