More than 40,000 overseas Chinese in North Korea, with unparalleled enthusiasm, held rallies in various places on October 3 to celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government.

Representatives from North Korean party and government organs and various circles were invited to attend, including Kim Won-bong, Minister of Inspection of the Central Government of North Korea, Jang Shi-u, Minister of Commerce, and Heo Jeong-suk, Minister of Culture and Propaganda. In addition, Morozov and Sabuchenko, representatives of the Soviet Embassy in North Korea, and Vasilyev, a TASS reporter, also attended the meeting. The meeting was held at 1 p.m. on the 3rd at the Pyongyang International Art Theater. The venue was simply and solemnly decorated. In the center of the rostrum were huge portraits of Stalin, Chairman Mao, and Kim Il-sung, and the national flags of China, North Korea, and the Soviet Union. On both sides hung banners with slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people" and "Long live the close unity of the three major nations of China, North Korea, and the Soviet Union." After singing the national anthem and observing a moment of silence for the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the People's Liberation War, the meeting was opened by Wen Shizhen, chairman of the conference. He said that we must respond to and implement Chairman Mao's call, firmly grasp the spirit of the people's democratic dictatorship and unite international friends to celebrate this great day. We overseas compatriots must be humble and prudent, and honestly unite and cooperate with our international friends. He also called on overseas Chinese to actively participate in various democratic constructions under the leadership of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Premier Kim Il-sung, so as to strengthen the international peace and democratic forces, jointly defend against aggressors, and strive for lasting world peace and people's democracy. Ma Yusheng, vice chairman of the North Korean Overseas Chinese Federation, said in his speech: "More than 40,000 overseas Chinese in North Korea feel very honored and happy about the emergence of a new China that is independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous on the world stage." He said: We must turn joy into strength. In the future, we must unite with the Korean people in the spirit of internationalism and actively participate in economic construction.
　　Guests Choi Gyeong-deok and Kim Seong-hak delivered speeches on behalf of the Korean Fatherland Unification Democratic Front and the Pyongyang Municipal People's Committee respectively. Choi emphasized that the victory of the Chinese people is also the victory of the international democratic camp, especially the victory of the people of Eastern countries who are fighting against Anglo-American imperialism for their own national independence. Kim Seong-hak said in his speech: Only by completely smashing American imperialism and its running dogs—Chiang Kai-shek of China and Syngman Rhee of Korea—can we obtain peace and happiness for the people of China and North Korea.
　　After the speeches, the Chinese film "Millions of Soldiers Cross the Yangtze River" was shown to add to the excitement.
