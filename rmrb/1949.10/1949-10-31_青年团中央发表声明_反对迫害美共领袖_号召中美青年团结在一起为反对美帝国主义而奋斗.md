　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 30th: The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League has issued the following statement regarding the US government's sentencing of leaders of the Communist Party of the United States to imprisonment and fines:
    In mid-July of last year, the reactionary US government successively ordered the arrest of Dennis, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States, and others, and prosecuted them for sedition. Recently, these eleven leaders of the US Communist Party were sentenced to five or three years of imprisonment and a fine of 10,000 US dollars. We Chinese youth express extreme indignation at this persecution by the reactionary US faction. Recalling that after the American soldier Pierson, who raped a Chinese university student in Beijing on December 25, 1946, was convicted in China, he was acquitted by the American court, and the thugs who murdered black people in various parts of the United States were all at large. However, the leaders of the Communist Party of the United States were sentenced to five or three years of imprisonment and a fine of 10,000 US dollars because they loyally safeguarded the interests of the American working people and the peace and democracy of the world. From these facts, we can see the essence of the so-called "democracy" and "freedom" of the reactionary US faction. In the United States, the working people have absolutely no rights to democracy and freedom. We, the peace-loving and democratic people of the whole world, must unite widely to oppose this kind of destruction of domestic people and challenge to human freedom by the reactionary US faction.
    The conspiracy of US imperialism to aid the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary faction in enslaving the Chinese people has been shattered by the Chinese people. All their conspiracies to oppress the American people and enslave the people of the world will also be shattered by the American people and the people of the world. The history of mankind will never proceed according to the conspiracies of US imperialism and its running dogs, but will undoubtedly advance along the road of people's liberation. We, the Chinese people and Chinese youth, will unite with the American people and American youth to fight for our common goal—opposing US imperialism.

　　青年团中央发表声明　
    反对迫害美共领袖            
    号召中美青年团结在一起为反对美帝国主义而奋斗
    【新华社北京三十日电】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会，为美国政府判处美国共产党领袖以徒刑及罚款事件，发表声明如下：
    美国反动政府在去年七月中，先后下令逮捕美国共产党总书记但尼斯等人，以谋叛罪对他们提起公诉，最近已将这十一位美共领袖判处五年或三年徒刑和一万元的罚金。我们中国青年对于美国反动派这种迫害举动，表示极度的愤慨。回想起一九四六年十二月二十五日在北京强奸中国大学女生的美国兵皮尔逊在中国判罪之后，复被美国法院判为无罪，在美国各地残杀黑人的恶徒一个个逍遥法外，而美国共产党的领袖，却因为忠诚地维护美国劳动人民的利益和全世界的和平民主，而遭到了五年或三年徒刑和一万元的罚金的判决。从这些事实，便可看到美国反动派的所谓“民主”、“自由”的实质。在美国，劳动人民是完全没有民主自由的权利的。我们全世界爱好和平民主的人民，一定要广泛地团结起来，反对美国反动派这种残害国内人民和对人类自由的挑战。
    美帝国主义援助蒋介石反动派奴役中国人民的阴谋计划，已经为中国人民所粉碎，他们压迫美国人民与奴役世界人民的一切阴谋计划，同样地将会被美国人民与全世界人民所粉碎。人类的历史决不会按美帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋计划进行，而是毫无疑义地沿着人民解放的道路前进。我们中国人民、中国青年，将和美国人民、美国青年团结一起，为了我们的共同的目标——反对美帝国主义而奋斗。
