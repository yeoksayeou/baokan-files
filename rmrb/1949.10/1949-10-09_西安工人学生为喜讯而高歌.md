News reached Xi'an, and the Yangko teams, propaganda teams, and propaganda truck teams, composed of workers and students, immediately turned this good news into songs and rhythmic clappers, singing in unison. On the streets, which were freshly cleared after a long rain, electric lights shone brightly, crowds gathered, and drums and gongs filled the air. Shouts of "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship" and "Long live lasting peace" never ceased. The workers expressed particular joy. Hou Yulin, a worker at the People's Automobile Repair Factory, said: We must celebrate this great event by learning from the production experience and technology of our Soviet worker brothers and strengthening our work. Li Peiyuan, an employee of the Zhongnan Match Factory, said: The Soviet Union was the first to abolish unequal treaties with China, and the Soviet Union was also the first to decide to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. What a great friendship this is!

　　西安工人学生为喜讯而高歌
    消息传到西安，由工人、学生们所组成的秧歌队、宣传队和宣传卡车队立刻把这个好消息编成唱词、快板，齐声高歌。在久雨初晴的街道上，电灯辉煌，人群拥满、锣鼓喧天。“中苏友谊万岁”“持久和平万岁”的欢呼声不绝于耳。工人们表示特别高兴。人民汽车修理厂工人侯玉麟说：要以学习苏联工人兄弟的生产经验和技术，加强工作来庆祝这件大喜事。中南火柴厂的职工李培源说：第一个废除对中国的不平等条约的是苏联，第一个决定和中华人民共和国建立外交关系的也是苏联，这是多伟大的友谊呀！
