Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 29th. A comprehensive TASS dispatch: October 27th marked the 125th anniversary of the founding of the "Soviet State Little Theater" in Moscow. The Soviet government and people regard this day as a significant anniversary for the development of Russian and Soviet culture and art, and grand and warm celebrations were held.
	The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, in view of the outstanding contributions of the "Soviet State Little Theater" to the development of Soviet dramatic art, issued an order to award 68 actors and stage supervisors of the theater the honorary title of "People's Artist of the USSR," etc., and to award 297 members of the theater various medals and decorations. Among the eleven people who received the highest award, the Order of Lenin, was Alexandra Yablochkina, the oldest actress in the theater, who has been performing in the theater for as long as 62 years. Among those who received the Order of the Red Banner of Labor was Professor Leonid Shapovalov, the manager of the theater. The awards were given not only to actors but also to stage staff, makeup artists, receptionists, theater cloakroom staff, and other personnel.
	In the past few days, congratulatory telegrams from the working people of Moscow, other theaters, actors from all over the Soviet Union, and representatives of cultural, drama, and art workers have poured in to the Soviet State Little Theater, expressing their warm praise and gratitude to the Little Theater. On the 25th alone, 40 delegations visited the Little Theater and offered their congratulations. On the 27th, commemorative meetings and scientific conferences were held in many cities throughout the Soviet Union, and exhibitions were held for the Little Theater.
	Moscow newspapers not only published news about this anniversary in prominent sections, but also published editorials. The Pravda editorial pointed out that since its birth, the Little Theater has been with the Russian people and closely linked to the Russian revolutionary movement, becoming a powerful source of Russia's advanced realist art, making Russian drama the leader of advanced dramatic art in the world. After the October Revolution, the Little Theater actively participated in the communist education of the working people. The Izvestia editorial pointed out that the Little Theater has played an outstanding role in the development of Russian and world culture, and has enhanced the socio-political significance of dramatic art. If we compare the advanced Soviet dramatic art with the profound corruption of the reactionary dramatic art in capitalist countries today, we can see that this anniversary is a significant event.

　　苏联国立小剧院成立百二十五周年纪念日            
    最高苏维埃主席团颁发奖章各地艺术工作者纷致电祝贺
    【新华社北京二十九日电】综合塔斯社消息：十月二十七日，是莫斯科的“苏联国立小剧院”成立一百二十五周年纪念日，苏联政府和人民都把这一天看作俄罗斯与苏维埃文化艺术之发展的意义重大的纪念日，并举行盛大热烈的庆祝。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团和俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃主席团，鉴于“苏联国立小剧院”在苏联戏剧艺术之发展中的卓越贡献，特颁布命令，授予该剧院六十八名演员及舞台监督以“苏联人民艺术家”等光荣称号；并授予该剧院的二百九十七名人员以各种勋章和奖章。获得最高勋章列宁勋章的十一人中，有该剧院年龄最大的女演员亚历山大拉·雅布洛契基娜，她一直在该剧院演出了六十二年之久。获得劳动红旗勋章的人们中，有该剧院的经理列奥尼德·沙波瓦洛夫教授。获奖的不仅有演员，而且也有舞台工作人员、化装人员、招待员、剧场更衣室工作人员及其他人员。
    这几天，莫斯科劳动人民、其他剧院、全苏各地演员及文化、戏剧、艺术工作者的代表们致苏联国立小剧院的贺电，有如雪片飞来，表示他们对小剧院的热烈赞美和感谢。仅二十五日一天中，就有四十个代表团访问了小剧院并致贺。二十七日全苏许多城市都举行纪念会和科学会议，并为小剧院举行展览会。
    莫斯科各报不仅以显要篇幅刊载关于这一纪念日的新闻，同时均发表社论。真理报社论指出：小剧院刚诞生时，就和俄罗斯人民在一起，与俄国革命运动密切关联着，成为俄国先进的现实主义艺术的强大源泉，使俄国戏剧成为全世界先进戏剧艺术的领导者。十月革命后，小剧院又积极地参加了对劳动人民的共产主义教育。消息报社论指出：小剧院在俄国与世界文化之发展中起了出色的作用，提高了戏剧艺术的社会政治意义。如果把苏联先进的戏剧艺术和目前资本主义国家反动戏剧艺术的深刻腐化作一对照，就可以知道这一纪念日是一个意义重大的事件。
