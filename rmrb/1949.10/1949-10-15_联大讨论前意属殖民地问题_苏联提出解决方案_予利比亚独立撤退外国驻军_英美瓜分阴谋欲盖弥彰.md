Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th -- According to a TASS dispatch from New York: Since September 30th, the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly—the Political and Security Committee—has begun studying the issue of former Italian colonies. This important matter, concerning the fate of nearly three million people in Libya, Eritrea, and former Italian Somaliland, has been under study in the UN General Assembly since 1948.

When the discussion of the Italian colonies issue began in the Political and Security Committee on September 30th, the Soviet delegation presented the following draft proposals: (1) Immediately grant Libya independence. All foreign troops and military personnel should withdraw within three months, and military bases should be abolished. (2) Eritrea should become independent after five years. During these five years, Eritrea will be administered according to the UN Trusteeship Council's agreement on trusteeship, with the Trusteeship Council appointing an administrator with full executive power, who will be responsible to the Trusteeship Council. Alongside the administrator, an advisory committee will be established, composed of representatives from the permanent members of the Security Council (Soviet Union, United States, Britain, France, China), Italy, and Abyssinia, as well as a European representative and two native representatives to be appointed from among the local Eritrean residents by the aforementioned seven representatives. The portion of Eritrean territory required for Abyssinia to have access to the sea via the port of Asseb should be ceded to Abyssinia. (3) For former Italian Somaliland, a trusteeship procedure should be established in the same manner as for Eritrea.

British representative McNeil, in his speech to the committee, attempted to conceal Britain's plan, proposed last year, to partition the Italian colonies. He feigned regret that the issue of the Italian colonies had not yet been resolved, although the whole world knows that the main reason for obstructing the resolution of this issue is the procrastination and delay tactics of the United States and Britain. McNeil insisted that the issue of Cyrenaica's (eastern Libya) independence had already been resolved by the British occupation authorities, who had given the Senussi, the ruler of Cyrenaica, fictitious "power." He demanded that the UN General Assembly recognize this unilateral arrangement by Britain and threatened to establish a similar puppet government in Eritrea, which borders Cyrenaica, otherwise. McNeil did not hide Britain's intention to seize Tripoli (northwestern Libya) by having it "join" Cyrenaica. While presenting Britain's plan for Cyrenaica and Tripoli, he also suggested placing former Italian Somaliland under Italian trusteeship and partitioning Eritrea—annexing the western provinces to Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, and giving the central and eastern provinces to Abyssinia. McNeil indicated that Britain was prepared to collude with France; Britain would give France as much support for its claims to Fezzan (southwestern Libya) as France gave Britain for its claims to Cyrenaica and Tripoli.

US representative Jessup made a statement to the committee. It was very clear from his statement that Libya should be granted independence at some uncertain and vague future date, and that the "preparatory work" for self-government and the establishment of government institutions should be entrusted to the current British and French occupation authorities. In order to conceal the imperialist nature of the American proposal, Jessup suggested establishing an "advisory committee," which, according to him, should be consulted by the British and French administrative authorities in Libya. Thus, the American representative attempted to turn the United Nations into some kind of appendage of the British and French colonial authorities. Jessup also supported the British demand for the western provinces of Eritrea, which McNeil wanted to incorporate into Sudan, and insisted that Somaliland should be placed under Italian "trusteeship."

Representatives of other countries also spoke in the Political Committee on the issue of the disposition of the former Italian colonies.

On October 11th, the Political Committee decided to establish a subcommittee to study the draft proposals and suggestions made by the representatives of various countries, and to formulate a unified agreement.

　　联大讨论前意属殖民地问题
    苏联提出解决方案
    予利比亚独立撤退外国驻军
    英美瓜分阴谋欲盖弥彰
    【新华社北京十四日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：自九月三十日以来，联合国大会第一委员会——政治安全委员会即开始研究前意大利殖民地问题。这个涉及利比亚、厄立特里亚以及前意属索马利兰将近三百万人口的命运的重要问题，自一九四八年以来即在联合国大会中进行研究。
    当意属殖民地问题的讨论于九月三十日在政治安全委员会一开始时，苏联代表团就提出了下述草案：（一）立即予利比亚以独立。一切外国军队和军事人员应于三个月内撤离，军事基地应予取消。（二）厄立特里亚应在五年之后独立。在这五年期间，厄立特里亚将按照联合国托管委员会关于托管的协议来管理，托管委员会将指定一个拥有行政全权的行政长官，向托管委员会负责。与行政长官一起，将设立咨询委员会，由安理会常任理事国（苏美英法中）与意大利和阿比西尼亚的代表，以及由上述七个代表在厄立特里亚当地居民中指定的一个欧洲人代表、两个土人代表共同组成。厄立特里亚领土中为了使阿比西尼亚能经过阿塞普港与海相通而需划归阿比西尼亚的部分，划归阿比西尼亚。（三）对前意属索马利兰，应按照与厄立特里亚相同的办法建立托管程序。
    英代表麦克奈尔在委员会上发言时试图掩遮英国去年提出的瓜分意属殖民地的计划。他对意属殖民地问题迄今仍未解决假装遗憾，虽然全世界都知道，阻挠解决该问题的主要是美英的怠工和拖延。麦克奈尔硬说，昔兰尼加（利比亚的东部）独立的问题已经由英国占领当局解决了，英国占领当局给了昔兰尼加的统治者森奴西以虚构的“权力”。他要求联合国大会承认英国这一片面的组合办法，并威胁着否则就要在与昔兰尼加毗邻的厄立特里亚建立一个类似的傀儡政府。麦克奈尔并不隐藏英国打算借使的黎波里（利比亚的西北部）“加入”昔兰尼亚的办法以攫取的黎波里。他提出英国对昔兰尼加和的黎波里的计划时，又建议将前意属索马利兰交意大利托管，并分割厄立特里亚——西部各省并于英埃苏丹，中央及东部各省给予阿比西尼亚。麦克奈尔表明英国准备与法国勾结，法国给予英国对昔兰尼加和的黎波里的要求多少支持，英国也将给予法国对法赞（利比亚的西南部）的要求多少支持。
    美代表耶塞普在委员会上发表声明。从他的声明中可以很明显地看到，利比亚应该在某种不确定而模糊的将来予以独立，而且，自治政府的“准备工作”及政府机构的成立，均应委托目前的英法占领当局。为了掩饰美国建议的帝国主义本质，耶塞普建议成立“咨询委员会”，根据他的说法，这个委员会应当供利比亚的英法行政当局咨询。因此，美国代表企图将联合国变为英法殖民当局的某种附属品。耶塞普又支持英国对厄立特里亚西部省份的要求，麦克奈尔要求将它并入苏丹，并坚持索马利兰应置于意大利“托管”之下。
    其他各国的代表，也先后在政治委员会就前意属殖民地的处理问题发表了意见。
    十月十一日，政治委员会决定成立小组委员会，以研究各国代表所提出的草案和建议，并制定一个一致的协议。
