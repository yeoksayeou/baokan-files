Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd: New York Dispatch: Medina, the reactionary judge of the United States New York Federal Court (i.e., New York District Court), on the 21st, sentenced ten leaders of the American Communist Party, including Dennis, member and General Secretary of the National Committee of the American Communist Party, Winston, member and Organizational Secretary, Stacher, member and Secretary of Propaganda and Education, Williamson, member and Labor Secretary, Gates, member and Editor-in-Chief of the *Daily Worker*, Green, member and Chairman of the Illinois State Committee, Winter, member and Chairman of the Michigan State Committee, Hall, member and Chairman of the Ohio State Committee, Bittelman (Vice-Chairman of the New York Fur Workers Union), and Davis (New York City Councilor), to five years in prison and a fine of $10,000 each for the so-called crime of "inciting the violent overthrow of the United States government." Thompson, a member, was sentenced to three years in prison and a fine of $10,000.

On the 21st, the court opened in a tense atmosphere. A large number of police and FBI (official US secret service) agents were concentrated inside the court, and 150 police officers were stationed outside the court. Despite this, hundreds of progressive elements set up picket lines outside the court, demanding the release of the Communist leaders.

Before the sentencing, Dennis, General Secretary of the American Communist Party, issued a statement. Dennis pointed out: "In the years to come, the nation will look back on this fascist-style 'trial' with shame and anger." Speaking of the Communist Party's determination to continue the struggle regardless of any event, Dennis said: "We face the future with the utmost confidence." Davis, one of the Communist leaders and a New York City Councilor (he is black, and during the trial Medina deprived him of the opportunity to serve as his own defense lawyer and speak to the jury) pointed out that the American blacks "have been oppressed for more than three centuries. This verdict and sentencing will continue to oppress them." Davis continued: However, black people will not be intimidated. "On their side, there is not only the American working class, but also the strength of progressive humanity all over the world."

Medina, in violation of precedent, refused to agree to bail the Communist leaders before the defendants appealed to a higher court. It is common practice in American courts to allow defendants, even serious criminal offenders, to be released on bail before appealing. However, Medina refused to give the Communist leaders this right and ruled that they must remain in jail.

The "defendants'" defense lawyers then announced that they would immediately ask a higher court to change Medina's decision on this point. The "defendants'" defense lawyers indicated that they would immediately appeal to a higher court.

At this point, the court adjourned, and the eleven American Communist leaders were taken to prison in handcuffs.

　　纽约反动法庭违反人民利益
  　竟判处美共领袖徒刑
    但尼斯声明决继续奋斗
    【新华社北京二十三日电】纽约讯：美国纽约联邦法院（即纽约地方法院）之反动法官麦迪纳，竟于二十一日以所谓“教唆以暴力颠覆美国政府”罪，判决美国共产党全国委员会委员兼总书记但尼斯、委员兼组织书记温斯顿、委员兼宣传教育书记史塔彻、委员兼劳工书记威廉姆森、委员兼工人日报总编辑盖兹、委员兼伊利诺斯州州委会主席格林、委员兼密执安州州委会主席温脱、委员兼俄亥俄州州委会主席贺尔、委员鲍塔许（纽约毛皮工人工会副主席）及委员戴维斯（纽约市议会议员）等十位美共领袖各处徒刑五年及罚金一万美元，委员汤普森处徒刑三年及一万美元罚金。
    二十一日，法庭是在紧张的气氛中开庭，大批警察与联邦调查局（美国官方特务机关）的特务集中在法庭里面，一百五十名警察分布于法院外面。尽管如此，仍有千百名进步分子在法庭外面布设纠察线，要求释放共产党领袖。
    在宣判之前，美国共产党总书记但尼斯发表声明。但尼斯指出：“在未来的岁月中，全国将怀着羞耻和愤怒来回顾这一法西斯式的‘审判’。”在谈到共产党将不顾一切事变继续奋斗时，但尼斯称：“我们以最大的信心面对未来。”共产党领袖之一、纽约市议会议员戴维斯（他是黑人，他在审判期间被麦迪纳剥夺掉充任自己的辩护律师及向陪审团讲话的机会）指出：美国黑人“已被压迫了三世纪有余。这一判决和宣判将继续使他们受压迫”。戴维斯继称：可是，黑人不会被吓倒。“在他们一边的，不仅有美国工人阶级，而且有全世界的进步人类的力量。”
    麦迪纳违反惯例，拒绝同意在被告向更高法庭提出上诉以前保释共产党领袖。美国法庭在被告上诉以前让被告甚至严重的刑事犯保释，乃是常例。但是，麦迪纳拒绝给共产党领袖以这种权利，并判决他们必须留在狱内。
    “被告”之辩护律师继而宣布，他们将立即要求更高的法庭改变麦迪纳关于这一点的决定。“被告”辩护律师表明，他们将立即向更高的法庭上诉。
    至此，法庭宣告闭庭，十一位美共领袖竟被带着手铐羁押监狱。
