What Experience Was Gained from the Songjiang People's Representative Conference?

Following the All-Circles People's Representative Conferences in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Jinan, Xuzhou, Wuxi and other cities, the All-Circles People's Representative Conferences in the counties of East China and the small and medium-sized cities with a population of more than 30,000 are being held successively. The All-Circles People's Representative Conference in Songjiang County, Southern Jiangsu Province, provides many good experiences that are worth referencing in various places.

The All-Circles People's Representative Conference in Songjiang County gave the representatives from all walks of life attending the conference a most realistic education, making them not only more clearly understand the propositions and policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government, but also deeply feel that the status of the people in the state power has undergone fundamental changes. The situation in which the people had no rights and were enslaved in the Kuomintang era is over. The People's Government under the leadership of the Communist Party is truly the government of the people of all democratic classes, and the people decide their own destiny according to their own will. Even during the period of military control when the conditions for a general election of people's representatives are not yet ready, the people can not only make full criticisms and reviews of the various measures of the People's Government at the All-Circles People's Representative Conference, but the People's Government also uses the opinions of the people as the basis for formulating and revising its various measures. This greatly enhances the sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of the people from all walks of life for the people's national and local construction undertakings. The worker and peasant representatives further recognized their status, strength and responsibility from the process of this conference, and began to specifically understand the true meaning and importance of the unity of all classes, thereby greatly improving their class consciousness. The cadres of the Party and the People's Government also saw most vividly in the actual life of this conference that the various guidelines and policies of the Party and the People's Government can only be better accepted and supported by the people of all classes through this method; can only be better combined with the practical requirements of the local people and become the people's own opinions; can only better concentrate the good opinions of the people of all classes to enrich and improve leadership; and can only better obtain the practical support of the people, thus more smoothly promoting the advancement of the Party and the People's Government's various construction undertakings. They unanimously felt that they had found a way to unite the people of all classes to overcome difficulties together and lead the people of all classes to advance together.

All these gains truly prove the correctness of the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: "The All-Circles People's Representative Conference is the best organizational form for the People's Government to contact the broad masses of people during the period of military control." When the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee instructed various places to convene All-Circles People's Representative Conferences with counties as units, individual cadres in East China still believed that this was a task assigned by the higher authorities, so it had to be done, and seemed to be a burden outside of their own work, which was not as convenient as the Party and the government holding a cadre meeting to convey the message. These prejudices were swept away after this meeting. On the contrary, they recognized that this was a necessity; they realized that only through this organizational form can we seek true understanding and close contact between the people of all classes, as well as between the people and the People's Government, and can we effectively promote work and overcome the tendencies of subjectivism and bureaucratism in the work.

The decisive key to the success of the All-Circles People's Representative Conference in Songjiang County lies in the direct leadership of the Songjiang Prefectural Committee of the CPC Southern Jiangsu District and the all-out efforts of the main responsible persons of the Songjiang County Committee of the CPC and the People's County Government, so that this conference can be prepared solemnly and relatively thoroughly in a relatively short period of time, and can promptly resolve the various problems arising in the course of the conference. On the one hand, it fully exerted the democracy of the conference, and on the other hand, it correctly grasped the concentrated guidance, thus enabling the conference to achieve good results.

If we examine it from the leadership of this conference, we believe that the following points are worth promoting:

First, the generation of representatives was relatively cautious and serious, and special attention was paid to grasping the representativeness of each representative. For example, the 286 representatives who attended the meeting included representatives from farmers' associations, trade unions, student associations, women's circles, cultural and educational circles, business circles, enlightened gentry, etc., as well as representatives selected by the Party, government, and military. For example, the quota allocation for rural areas, cities, and market towns, the appropriate proportion of representatives from various circles and industries, and various aspects such as gender, age, religion, belief, and different political tendencies were all taken care of. Some cadres only paid attention to the purity and seriousness of the representatives themselves, but did not pay enough attention to the breadth and flexibility that should be paid attention to in the work of electing representatives. Once the inspection found out, it was immediately corrected in most cases. The conference proved that not only should attention be paid to the broad representativeness of representatives of workers, peasants, students, and intellectuals, but also the representatives of other democratic classes should pay attention to their broad representativeness; absorbing people who are connected with the people of various democratic classes and can represent opinions from all aspects to participate in the conference, and not limiting the conference to a narrow circle, but enlarging the circle of the conference. Only by making the conference more fully reflect the opinions of all parties can it be more convenient to educate the broad masses, and enhance the connection and unity between the People's Government and all parties.

Second, the generation of proposals is closely combined with the preparation of proposals. Before the conference, the district and county successively convened peasant representative conferences to democratically elect peasant representatives. Trade unions under the leadership of the county Federation of Trade Unions elected worker representatives; students held meetings to elect student representatives; business circles and freelance professionals in county towns and market towns were generally recommended at symposiums; enlightened gentry were specially invited by the People's Government. At the same time as electing, recommending, recommending and inviting representatives, discussions and consultations were held on relevant conference proposals and relevant opinions. In particular, the convening of the Peasant Representative Conference made the best preparations for the All-Circles Representative Conference. In this way, the delegations from all walks of life at the conference can put forward their own proposals and opinions with relatively good preparation, and the People's Government can also weigh the importance and urgency of the proposals in advance, and consider the policies to be adopted more calmly.

Third, the democratic spirit was fully demonstrated at the conference. The persons in charge of the conference first realized that whether democracy can be fully demonstrated is the key to the success of the conference, allowing every representative attending the conference to speak freely, and to know everything and say everything. Here, the allocation of conference time is very important. At the beginning of this conference, unnecessary ceremonies were reduced, the reporting time was kept as short as possible, and the discussion time accounted for more than two-thirds of the total time. At the beginning of the speech, some representatives had concerns, but they were eventually eliminated by the responsible cadres' humble attitude of earnestly seeking opinions. The most important thing here is to give everyone the opportunity to express their opinions. Before the conference, there were group meetings, and there were individual talks and off-site seminars between the conference discussions and group meetings. Problems were discovered and opinions were prepared in the group meetings. Several issues were concentrated and discussed in depth at the conference. At the meeting, we were not afraid of disputes, allowed the expression of opposing opinions, and let the positive and negative sides express their reasons for everyone to study seriously, and then make the divergent opinions converge. Many representatives felt that this approach laid a reliable foundation for all classes to act together and implement government policies.

Fourth, because this conference was a county-wide conference, they firmly grasped the working principle of focusing on rural areas while taking into account urban areas. At the conference, more than 170 proposals from all parties were appropriately arranged, and first, the issues that everyone was most concerned about, such as rent reduction and interest reduction, autumn grain levy, and reasonable burden, were put forward for concentrated discussion, and all issues related to this were also resolved in a unified manner. Other issues were handed over to the relevant government departments and specialized committees for study and processing. In this way, all major issues were fully discussed and resolved, and at the same time, the requirements of all parties were taken into account, and the leadership took the initiative.

Fifth, this conference also made better conclusions and explanations. Specific provisions were made for the implementation methods of the current Songjiang work guidelines and various important tasks in the autumn work, and all of them were fully studied and unanimously approved by the conference. At the same time, it was decided that after the closing of the conference, the representatives of the presidium would organize a resident committee as the resident organ from the closing of this session to the opening of the second session; and the establishment of research committees such as "production and disaster relief", "culture and education", "resumption of work and business and labor-capital relations" and "tax management" was approved to carry out work under the leadership of the resident committee.

At this conference, the representatives of the Party, government, and military were generally serious and earnest. The rural guerrilla habits of some cadres and some practices of doing everything on their own in their work, as well as not observing time, not paying attention to order, and not frequently contacting people from all walks of life, have been criticized by individual representatives, which should be taken as a lesson.

We deeply hope that various places will universally convene All-Circles Representative Conferences in various counties and continue to create more and better experiences, and truly prepare sufficient conditions for the future general election of People's Congresses on the basis of mobilizing the masses, so that the People's Representative Conference will become a basic form for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.

### 从松江各界人民代表会议得到些什么经验？

　　从松江各界人民代表会议得到些什么经验？
    （上海解放日报社论）
    继沪、宁、杭、青、济、徐、锡等城市各界人民代表会议之后，华东各县以县为单位的及三万以上人口的中小城市的各界人民代表会议，正在相继召开。这次苏南区松江县的各界人民代表会议，提供了不少好的经验，值得各地参考。
    松江县的各界人民代表会议给参加会议的各界代表们一个最现实的教育，使他们不仅更清楚地了解共产党与人民政府的主张和政策，而且深深感觉到人民在国家政权中的地位已经起了根本变化。国民党时代人民那种无权利、受奴役的状况，已经过去了。在共产党领导之下的人民政府，真正是各个民主阶级人民自己的政府，人民是按照自己的意志来决定自己的命运。即使在普选的人民代表大会条件尚未准备完毕的军事管制时期，在各界人民代表会议上，人民不仅可以对人民政府各项设施提出充分的批评和检讨，人民政府还把人民的意见作为制订与修改自己各项措施的根据。这就大大提高了各界人民对人民国家与地方建设事业的责任心与积极性。工农代表们从这个会议的过程中进一步认识了自己的地位、力量与责任，开始具体了解各阶层团结的真正意义及其重要性，从而大大提高了自己的阶级觉悟。党与人民政府的干部，也在这个会议的实际生活里最生动地看到了党与人民政府的各项方针与政策，只有通过这种方式才能更好地为各阶层人民所接受与拥护；才能更好地与当地人民的现实要求相结合并成为人民自己的意见；才能更好地集中各阶层人民中好的意见以充实改进领导；才能更好地取得人民的切实的支持，因而更顺利的推动党与人民政府的各项建设事业前进。他们一致感觉从这中间找到了一个团结各阶层人民共同克服困难并带领各阶层人民共同前进的门径。
    这一切收获都千真万确地证明了党中央毛主席指示的正确：“各界人民代表会议，是军事管制时期人民政府联系广大群众的最好的组织形式。”当中共中央华东局指示各地以县为单位召开各界人民代表会议之初，华东区尚有个别干部认为这是上级交下的一项任务，因此不开不行，似乎是本身工作之外的一种负担，不如党与政府开个干部会传达一下那样方便。这些偏见，经过这次会议，是一扫而空了。相反地，他们认识了这是一种必要；认清了只有通过这个组织形式才能求得各阶层人民相互之间，以及人民与人民政府相互之间的真正了解与亲密联系，才能有效地推动工作与克服工作中的主观主义与官僚主义倾向。
    松江县各界人民代表会议获得成功的决定关键在于中共苏南区松江地委的直接领导，中共松江县委与人民县政府主要负责人的全力以赴，因而使得这个会议能够在比较短促的时间内有郑重地与较周密地进行准备，能够及时解决会议过程中所产生的各项问题。一方面既充分地发挥了会议的民主，另方面又正确地掌握了集中的指导，因而使会议获得良好结果。
    如果从这次会议的领导上加以检查，我们认为有以下几点值得发扬：
    第一、代表的产生比较审慎认真，并特别注意到各个代表的代表性的掌握。如到会代表二百八十六人，包括了农会、工会、学生会、妇女界、文化教育界、工商界、开明士绅等等方面的代表，以及党政军选派代表。又如对农村、城市、集镇的名额分配，各界各业代表的适当比例，及性别、年龄、宗教、信仰、不同的政治倾向等等各方面都照顾到了。部分干部曾只注意到代表本身纯洁性与严肃性的这一面，而对于在推选代表工作中所应注意的广泛性与灵活性注意得不够。一经检查发现，立即大部分纠正了。会议证明：不仅对工、农、学生、知识分子的代表要注意到广泛的代表性，即其他民主阶层的代表，也要注意到他的广泛的代表性；吸收与各民主阶层人民有联系的能代表各方面意见的人参加会议，不要把会议只限于狭小的圈子，而是把会议的圈子拉大。只有使会议更能充分反映各方面的意见，才更便利教育广大群众，增强人民政府与各方面的联系与团结。
    第二、产生代表与准备提案密切结合。大会之前，曾由区到县先后分别召开了农民代表会议，民主选举农民代表。县总工会领导下的各业工会推选了工人代表；学生开会选举了学生代表；县城与各集镇工商界、自由职业者一般是在座谈会上推荐产生；开明士绅则由人民政府特别邀请。并在选举、推选、推荐及邀请代表的同时，进行了有关会议提案及有关意见的讨论与磋商。特别是农民代表会议的召开，为各界代表会议做了最好的准备。这样便使得会议上各界代表团能较有准备的提出自己的提案与意见，人民政府亦得于事先权衡其轻重缓急，比较从容的考虑应采的方针。
    第三、会议中民主精神获得了充分的发挥。负责主持会议的人员，首先了解到民主的能否充分发挥是会议成败的关键，让到会的每一代表能畅所欲言，做到知无不言，言无不尽。这里，会议时间的支配很重要。这次会议一开始便减去不必要的仪式，报告时间力求简短，讨论时间占了全部时间的三分之二强。发言开始，某些代表曾有顾虑，但终为负责干部虚怀若谷恳切征求意见的态度所消除。这里最重要的是让大家有发表意见的机会。大会之前开了小组会，大会讨论与小组会之间又有个别交谈，会外座谈。在小组会上发现问题，准备意见。在大会上集中几个问题进行深入讨论。在会议上不怕争论，允许发表反对的意见，让正面反面各抒理由大家郑重研究，然后使分歧意见归于一致。许多代表都感到：这样做法就替各阶层共同行动贯彻政府政策，打下了可靠的基础。
    第四、这次会议因为是一个全县性的会议，他们紧紧掌握了以农村为重点兼顾城市的工作方针。在会议中把各方提案一百七十余件加以适当的安排，首先将大家最关切的减租减息、秋季征粮、合理负担等问题提出集中讨论，并将一切与此有关的各项问题也连带加以统一解决。其他问题则交政府有关部门及专门的委员会研究处理。如此各主要问题既得到充分讨论解决，同时也照顾了各方面的要求，领导上亦从而取得了主动。
    第五、这次会议还做了较好的结束与交代，对于当前松江工作方针与秋季工作中的各项重要工作的实施方法，均作了具体的规定，并都经过大会充分研究后而一致通过了。同时决定在大会闭幕之后，以主席团各代表组织驻会委员会为本届会议闭幕后至第二届会议开幕前的驻会机关；并通过设立“生产救灾”、“文化教育”、“复工复业与劳资关系”及“税务管理”等研究委员会，在驻会委员会领导下进行工作。
    这次会议上，党政军代表一般是严肃认真的。部分干部的农村游击习气以及工作中某些包办代替的作风，和不遵守时间，不注意秩序，不经常与各界人士接触等，曾受到个别代表的批评，这应引为教训。
    我们深望各地普遍召开各县各界代表会议，并继续创造更多更好的经验，切切实实从发动群众的基础上，替将来普选的人民代表大会准备充分条件，使人民代表会议成为巩固人民民主专政的基本形式。　　【新华社上海十四日电】
