Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th: TASS reports: Tens of thousands of Soviet workers, engineers and staff have, in the post-war period, come to possess housing as personal property. The Soviet government has vigorously assisted the working people in constructing their own houses, providing them with land for free permanent use, granting them long-term loans and supplying them with the necessary building materials. In the three years after the war, the State Bank has loaned 4.5 billion rubles to the working people for building houses. According to the decree formulated by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, every Soviet citizen has the right to purchase or build a one- or two-story house as personal property, and the land allocated to citizens is given to them for permanent use.

　　In order to meet the needs of the people, in addition to large-scale construction of permanent housing, the Soviet industry of constructing mobile homes has also become a large-scale industry. Since the implementation of Stalin's post-war Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Ministry of Building Materials Industry alone has restored and built thirty powerful enterprises of this kind, and these enterprises are capable of producing mobile homes covering an area of 700,000 square meters annually. The Arkhangelsk and Smolensk regions of the Russian Republic are also building two large mobile home construction enterprises. The Moscow Oblast mobile home construction enterprise has now begun to build a kind of mobile home known for its exquisite decoration and beautiful design. Each mobile home has eight residences, and each residence has two or three rooms. 500 such homes will be produced by the end of the year. In the Kuznetsk coalfield area, near the Donbass coal mine, the Ural industrial center and other residential areas, fully equipped mobile homes are being built like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. In Prokopyevsk, the center of the Kuzbass coalfield, the municipal enterprise alone has built 1,500 mobile homes.

　　每个人都有精美房子住
  　苏联大规模兴建房屋
    【新华社北京十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联数以万计的工人、工程师和职员，在战后已有了作为个人财产的住宅。苏联政府大力帮助劳动人民来建筑他们自己的房屋，供给他们免费永远使用的土地，向他们长期贷款并供给必要的建筑材料。在战后三年内，国家银行已贷出四十五亿卢布给劳动人民建造房屋。依照苏联最高苏维埃主席团所制定的命令，每一个苏联公民都有权购买或建筑一层或两层的房屋作为个人财产，分配予公民的土地，是交给他们永久使用的。
    为了适应人民的需要，除了大规模建筑固定的房屋以外，现在，苏联活动房屋的建造业，亦已成为大规模的工业。在斯大林战后五年计划实行以来，单是苏联建筑材料工业部，就恢复和建筑了三十个强有力的这种企业，这些企业每年能够生产占面积七十万平方公尺的活动房屋。俄罗斯共和国的亚尔干日尔斯克和斯摩棱斯克两州，又在建筑两个庞大的活动房屋建造企业。莫斯科州活动房屋建筑企业，现在开始建造一种以装璜精良，设计美观著称的活动房屋，每一座活动房屋有八个住宅，每个住宅有两三个房间，在年底前将生产出五百座这种房屋。在库兹涅茨克煤田区、顿巴斯煤矿附近、乌拉尔工业中心和其他地方的居民区，设备齐全的活动房屋，正在如雨后春笋般地建设起来。单单在库兹巴斯煤田的中心——普罗科彼耶夫斯克，市营企业就建设了一千五百座活动房屋。
