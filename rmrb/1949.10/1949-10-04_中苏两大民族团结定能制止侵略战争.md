　　Li Fuchun of the Northeast Bureau pointed out: The Chinese people have stood up straight from now on, the Chinese nation is no longer a humiliated nation, and the Chinese people have begun a new era from now on. Then he called on all workers, peasants, intellectuals, scientists, technicians, industrialists, businessmen, and all patriotic democratic people in Northeast China to work hard to carry out large-scale economic construction and cultural construction, support the whole country, and carry the revolutionary war to the end. He also said: The great strength of world people's democracy and peace is unprecedentedly powerful. As long as the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union unite, they will surely be able to prevent new wars of aggression and win international peace. Wu Xiuquan, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Military Region, said: We will resolutely implement the unified command, unified system, unified establishment, and unified discipline of the Central People's Government and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission. We must gradually build a regularized national defense force to defend world peace. We must contribute more and enjoy less, adhere to the style of hard struggle, and save national financial resources for economic and cultural construction. Lin Feng, Deputy Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, pointed out: Northeast China is currently focusing on economic construction and is actively learning from Soviet experience to strive for the industrialization of Northeast China. He said: I call on all the people of Northeast China to take practical and active actions to create a climax of economic construction; the Northeast People's Government and governments at all levels must resolutely implement all the resolutions of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and ensure the implementation of all orders and instructions of the Central People's Government. Zhao Guoyou, a labor hero who created new production records, said: Chairman Mao's election as Chairman of the Central People's Government has realized the hope of our working class for decades. Gao Lian, a liberated peasant who has worked the land for eighteen years, said: We stand on our own land and can freely express our opinions as peasants. We sincerely thank the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We must step up production, step up the autumn harvest, and prepare to produce more grain and grow more cotton to supply the needs of cities and factories and build a new China. Zhang Guiying, a youth representative, said: We young people resolutely oppose the threat to world peace by the war-mongers headed by US imperialism; we must love the motherland and be her loyal children. We will study hard, actively participate in production and construction, and join the army, navy, and air force, playing a pioneering role in the ranks of defending the motherland.
   　 The birth of New China is inseparable from the help of the Soviet Union. We thank our Soviet brothers and sisters.
    Bai Lianjie, a women's representative and a female worker at the New Third Factory, said: We women across the country have stood up, and this is given to us by the Communist Party; we also sincerely thank the birth of New China is inseparable from the help of socialist Soviet Union. We wholeheartedly thank our Soviet brothers and sisters. Zou Lei, a cultural representative, said: We are determined to run schools well and train a large number of young cadres and experts. Wang Penghun, a representative of industry and commerce, said: He is determined to mobilize all the funds stored up to carry out legitimate industry and commerce, face the countryside, and serve the vast number of peasants. When the meeting carried out the review parade, the three groups of teams all passed through the rostrum, and six people's planes circled at low altitude. The three teams immediately turned into six streams, heading towards various streets. Cheers and songs shook the mountains and rivers.
