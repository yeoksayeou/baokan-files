    Conducting Disease Investigation and Treatment, Organizing Village Health Committees, and Training Health Personnel.
    [Reported by this newspaper] The anti-epidemic medical team dispatched by the North China People's Government Health Department went to Zhuoxian County on September 28th to cooperate with production and disaster relief, and to carry out health experiment work. Focusing on the eighth, third, and Chengguan districts of the county, they first conducted disaster relief propaganda and disease investigation, and cooperated in treatment. In just half a month, they have treated 726 people, organized health committees in 24 villages, and trained 63 old midwives and active women as candidates for the upcoming midwifery training class. Hygiene worker training is also planned to start soon.
    According to the team's investigation of 543 women who had given birth, a total of 2,696 births had occurred, of which 954 died within one week of birth, with an infant mortality rate of 34 percent. The team also conducted a survey of more than 400 people in three villages regarding the endemic disease goiter (locally called "ying dai"), with the thickest neck circumference of patients reaching 56@. There were even five-year-old children who had been suffering from the disease for four years. In particular, those who have developed the disease in the last three years account for about 40 percent of the total number of patients. Treatment methods for this disease are currently being studied. In addition, stool examinations were performed on 90 people, and it was found that 64 people's stool contained roundworm eggs. Examinations are continuing and treatment is being added.
