Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: The entire crew of the Hai Liao, which broke away from the Kuomintang reactionary government to return, recently published an open letter to the seamen of the Kuomintang China Merchants Bureau Taiwan Navigation Company and various bureaucratic capitalist shipping companies. The full text is as follows:

To the seamen of the Kuomintang China Merchants Bureau Taiwan Navigation Company and various bureaucratic capitalist shipping companies:

We, the Hai Liao, on September 19th at 9:00 PM, while on duty in Gangshan, automatically and formally declared liberation and sailed back to the Liberated Area. We arrived here just in time for the great joyous event of the people, the official establishment of the People's Republic of China. On October 1st, our Hai Liao proudly raised the magnificent five-starred red flag of the new China. How excited and happy we are! Comrades, the ships of the China Merchants Bureau, Taiwan Navigation Company, and bureaucratic capital are the property of the people, but they are being used by the Kuomintang reactionary government, lackeys of British and American imperialism, in activities that violate the interests of the people. We seamen are forced to work on these ships, and our hearts are indeed very painful. Now, the grave of this Kuomintang reactionary government has already been dug by us, the people, and they will soon be buried. If you are forced to continue to drag on with this reactionary government, your own lives and safety will become a serious problem in the future. Moreover, the vast majority of your families and relatives are in the Liberated Areas, and they all hope that you will return. But do not return empty-handed. You should immediately awaken, find ways to bring back the people's property, and serve the people. Only then will you be worthy of yourselves and the people. Your ships will receive the warmest welcome in any port of the Liberated Area. Your actions will be absolutely free, your lives will be absolutely guaranteed, and your private property will be absolutely protected. If you want to return home, the People's Government will provide all travel expenses. Comrades, wake up quickly and sail the ships back! Do not hesitate any longer.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sincerely, All Crew Members of the Hai Liao

　　海辽轮全体船员
  　告国民党海员书
    【新华社北京二十四日电】脱离国民党反动政府来归的海辽轮全体船员，日前发表告国民党招商局台湾航业公司及各官僚资本轮船公司的海员书，全文如下：
    国民党招商局台湾航业公司及各官僚资本轮船公司的海员们：
    我们海辽轮，于九月十九日下午九时，在港汕应差途中，自动正式宣布解放，归航解放区。我们到这里正赶着人民的大喜事，中华人民共和国正式宣布成立。我们海辽轮在十月一日已挂起新中国红底五星雄壮的国旗，我们是何等的兴奋与快乐！诸位，招商局、台航公司及官僚资本的船只是人民的财产，而被英美帝国主义的走狗国民党反动政府用于违反人民利益的勾当上，我们海员被迫着在船上工作，我们的内心的确是非常痛苦的。现在这国民党反动政府的坟墓，我们人民早已替他们掘好，不久就要将他们下葬了。你们被迫着再跟了这反动政府拖下去，就是你们本身的生活与安全将来都会成严重的问题，而你们极大多数的家属与亲友都在解放区，他们都希望你们回来。可是不要空手回来，你们该马上觉悟，设法把人民的财产带回来，为人民服务，这才对得起自己，对得起人民。你们的船驶到任何解放区港口，都会受到最热烈的欢迎，对你们的行动绝对自由，生活绝对保障，私人财产绝对保护，归家的话，旅费等一切都有人民政府发给。诸位，快些觉悟把船开回来吧！不要再迟疑了。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　海辽全体船员启
