　　The Soviet delegation of literary, artistic, and scientific workers, in their actions and speeches, showed us a love, sincerity, and brotherhood that is too profound for my pen to describe.

　　They not only increased our people's understanding of the Soviet Union and enhanced the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, but more importantly, they gave us valuable experience, greater confidence, and infinite courage, making us want to learn from the Soviet Union automatically.

　　They made us understand that only in socialist countries can art, science, and education achieve normal and accelerated development, fully serve the people, and forever benefit the people.

　　"What could be more noble and glorious than benefiting the liberated motherland and people?" This is a sentence that Soviet representatives often used to encourage us in their speeches, discussions, and individual conversations, and it is also the sentence that touched me the most deeply.

　　使我感受最深的话
    严济慈
    苏联文学艺术科学工作者代表团，在行动中，在讲话中，对我们热爱真诚和兄弟一样，留给我们的印象太深刻了，决非我的笔墨所能形容。
    他们不仅增加我国人民对苏联的了解，增进中苏两国人民的友谊，更重要的是给了我们宝贵的经验，更大的信心，与无限的勇气，使我们自动地要向苏联学习。
    使我们明白：不论在文艺方面，科学方面，教育方面，惟有在社会主义的国家里，才能得到正常的加速的发展，完全为人民服务，永远造福于人民。
    “还有什么能比造福于解放了的祖国和人民更崇高和光荣的呢？”这是苏联代表们在讲演中在座谈中在个别谈话中所常提来勉励我们的一句话，也是感动我最深的一句话。
