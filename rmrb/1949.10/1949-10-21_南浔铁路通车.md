    (Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 20th) The Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway, from Nanchang to Jiujiang, was fully opened to traffic on the 15th of this month. The line is 128 kilometers long. When the remnant Kuomintang bandit troops retreated southward from Jiujiang in mid-May, they severely damaged the railway. After four months of hard work by the railway staff, it was completely repaired on the 14th of this month.
