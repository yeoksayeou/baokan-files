The frontline battles are going well,
The enemy retreats to Huangjia Temple.

The cook, Long Jin'gou,
After delivering lunch, he walks back,
Walking to Yangshu Village,
A KMT soldier jumps out from behind a tree.

Long Jin'gou,
Roars:
"Put down your gun! Hands up!"

The soldier is named Feng Baliang,
Quickly raises his hands and says:
"I am a Central Army soldier,
Specially here to surrender."

Long Jin'gou picks up the gun,
Leads him to the side of the main road:
"Don't call yourself 'Central Army soldier' anymore,
Change it to 'KMT bandit army',
Because the bandit army robs the common people..."
Feng Baliang says softly:
"The KMT bandit army is too bad,
The officials deduct food and pay,
Not letting us eat enough;
I was originally a farmer,
Only hate that Chiang Kai-shek forced me to do it!
Who would want to fight for him,
Everyone wants to surrender to the Communist Party,
So I hid in the gully,
Waiting for you to come and collect my gun..."

Long Jin'gou helps him up the slope:
"Although you may have made some mistakes in the past,
That is not your fault,
As long as you can correct your mistakes today,
We will treat you very kindly."

Feng Baliang is very happy,
He rubs his fists and says to Long Jin'gou:
"I want to be with the People's Liberation Army,
Working together to fight the bandit Chiang!"
September 1, 1949, Nanjing

　　龙金狗和冯八两
    丁  力
    前线战事打得好，
    敌人退到黄家庙。
　
    炊事员，龙金狗，
    送罢午饭往回走，
    一走走到杨树村，
    树后跳出一个蒋匪兵。
　
    龙金狗，
    一声吼：
    “把枪放下！举起手！”
　
    匪兵名叫冯八两，
    连忙举手把话讲：
    “我是中央兵，
    特为来投降。”
　
    龙金狗捡起了枪，
    带他走到大路旁：
    “以后不要喊‘中央兵’，
    改口叫做‘蒋匪军’，
    因为匪军抢劫老百姓……”
    冯八两小声讲：
    “蒋匪军太不好，
    当官的克扣粮和饷，
    不让我们能吃饱；
    我本来是个庄稼人，
    只恨蒋介石逼着搞！
    谁个愿意替他去打仗，
    个个想投共产党，
    所以我躲在山沟里，
    等到你们来缴枪……”
　
    龙金狗把他扶上坡：
    “你过去虽说有些错，
    但那不是你的过，
    只要今天能改错，
    我们待你很宽和。”
　
    冯八两心里很欢喜，
    他磨拳擦掌跟龙金狗讲：
    “我要和解放军在一起，
    一同出力去打贼老蒋”！
    一九四九、九、一、南京
