Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 28th: According to TASS, New York: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly discussed the report submitted by the so-called Greek Problem Mediation Committee on the 24th. At the beginning of the meeting, the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, issued a special statement on saving Greek patriots (the full text of the statement has been published).

The representative of the Greek royalist-fascist government, Pipinelis, followed Vyshinsky's speech and was forced to admit that the Greek royalist-fascist government had used brutal repressive actions. However, he assured the representatives (as he had similarly assured the Political Committee in previous meetings) that the Greek royalist-fascist government had taken steps to ease the state of terror and had considered establishing some kind of "new trial and pardon procedure." But he immediately added that this procedure "does not guarantee that all death sentences and judgments will be suspended."

Ukrainian representative Manuilsky then pointed out that the representative of the Athens government was trying to distract the Political Committee from the events currently taking place in Greece, where the most brutal repression was being carried out against progressives. The Athens royalist-fascist government, fearing that the General Assembly might demand that it stop the terror, has recently intensified its terror activities. Even according to the Athens representative's own words, royalist-fascist military courts have sentenced 1,698 Greek democrats to death. In Greece, people are secretly shot or killed under the pretext of "attempting to escape." Thousands of patriots are killed or die in so-called "re-education camps." People are subjected to inhuman torture and beaten to death with rods in these "re-education camps." For example, in the "re-education camp" on the island of Makronisos, prisoners are flogged unconscious every day. At night, prisoners are driven out of their residences to cliffs, where they are tortured and thrown into the sea. Some people are doused with petroleum and then set on fire. Others are stripped naked, covered in black oil, and left in the hot sun all day until they "repent." This is what is called "re-education." The henchmen of Himmler in Athens are attempting to execute and brutally exterminate Greek patriots who bravely fought against the Hitlerite aggressors for the freedom and independence of their homeland. Fire, hot sun, hunger, cold, and torture are all used by the royalist-fascist executioners to force innocent people to "confess" to crimes they have not committed, driving them mad, to suicide, or to die in prolonged suffering. The United Nations cannot remain indifferent to this terror that reigns in Greece. As long as this lawless terror continues, there will be no peaceful solution in Greece.

Manuilsky concluded: "The delegation of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic wholeheartedly supports the Soviet delegation's proposal and urges all delegations to vote in favor of the Soviet proposal."

The speeches by the representatives of Poland, Belarus, and Czechoslovakia also supported the Soviet proposal.

Polish representative Katz-Suchy also suggested that the name of Krytziz, a Greek patriot sentenced to death, should also be included in the Soviet proposal.

　　联大政委会讨论拯救希爱国者　
    苏联建议获得支持  
    美英妄图终止讨论阴谋失败
    【新华社北京二十八日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会二十四日讨论所谓希腊问题调解委员会提出的报告。在会议开始时，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发表了拯救希腊爱国者的特别声明（声明全文已发表）。
    希腊保皇法西斯政府代表比比尼利斯，接着维辛斯基发言，他被迫承认了希腊保皇法西斯政府使用了残酷的镇压行动。但是，他向代表们保证说（他在政治委员会以前的会议上也曾同样的保证过）：希腊保皇法西斯政府业已采取步骤，以和缓恐怖状态，并已考虑建立某种“新的审判与赦免的程序”。但他马上又说：这种程序“并不保证一切死刑、判决将延缓执行”。
    乌克兰代表曼努意斯基接着指出：雅典政府代表竭力想使政治委员会不注意现在正在希腊发生的事件，那里正对进步分子进行着最残酷的镇压行动。雅典保皇法西斯政府由于害怕大会可能会要求它停止恐怖行为，所以，近来更加加紧了它的恐怖活动。即使根据雅典代表自己的话，保皇法西斯军事法庭已将希腊民主分子一千六百九十八人判决死刑。在希腊，人们是被秘密枪决或者以“企图逃跑”为借口而杀死的。数以千计的爱国分子，在所谓“感化营”中被杀害或死去。人们在这种“感化营”中受到非人的折磨和用杆棒打死。譬如在马克罗尼索斯岛的“感化营”中，囚人被鞭笞得不省人事，是天天都有的事情。晚上，囚人被赶出住所引到悬崖上，在那里折磨他们，并把他们投入海中。有的人被在身上浇上石油然后放火烧炙。还有把人们身上衣服剥光涂上黑油，把他们放在炎热的太阳下晒一整天，直到他们“悔过”为止。所谓“感化”，就是这样的。雅典的希姆莱的门徒们，企图枪决和狰狞地灭绝曾经为祖国的自由独立而英勇地与希特勒匪帮侵略者作战的希腊爱国分子。火、炎热的阳光、饥饿、寒冷和刑罚，都被保皇法西斯刽子手用来强迫无辜的人民“招认”他们不曾犯过的罪状，逼得他们发疯、自杀，或者在长期的痛苦中死去。联合国对统治着希腊的这种恐怖，不能无动于中。这种无法无天的恐怖行为一天不止，希腊就一天不能得到和平解决。
    曼努意斯基在结语中指出：“乌克兰苏维埃共和国代表团全心全意支持苏联代表团的建议，并敦请各代表团都投票赞成苏联建议。”
    波兰、白俄罗斯、捷克代表的发言也都支持苏联建议。
    波兰代表卡茨——苏琪并建议，将被判死刑的希腊爱国分子克里齐提斯的名字，也列入苏联的建议中。
