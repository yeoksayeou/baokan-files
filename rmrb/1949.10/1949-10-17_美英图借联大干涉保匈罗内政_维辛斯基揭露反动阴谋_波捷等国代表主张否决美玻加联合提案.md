Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 16th: New York dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee concluded its six-day discussion on the so-called "violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania" on October 12th. The US and British reactionaries, who instigated this slanderous propaganda against the people's democratic countries, originally intended to turn the discussion of this issue into a trial of the people's democratic regimes of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. However, this calculation was wrong. The result of the discussion revealed the true colors of those who do not hesitate to use despicable means of sabotage, assassination, and military rebellion conspiracies to overthrow the democratic governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania.

This "issue" was raised at the Third Session of the UN General Assembly. At that time, the US and British bloc, under the pretext of violating the UN Charter and treaties with Hungary and Bulgaria, included the trial of Mindszenty, the Hungarian traitor, and a group of Bulgarian clergymen—spies of the American and British intelligence agencies—on the agenda of the General Assembly.

Since the Third Session of the UN General Assembly, new facts have been discovered regarding the subversive activities of American and British spies in these countries. The recent trial of Irak and his accomplices in Hungary is a clear example. In view of the failure of their conspiracy to overthrow the people's democratic governments, the American and British reactionaries have once again decided to use the platform of the General Assembly to slander these countries in order to cover up the criminal activities of American spies and their servants with a smokescreen of deception and absurd accusations.

On the first day of the Committee's discussion of this "issue," US representative Cohen spoke, repeating the old tune of condemning the people's democratic regimes of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. He put forward a so-called "joint" proposal by the United States, Bolivia, and Canada, suggesting that the International Court of Justice of the United Nations be requested to provide an interpretation of certain clauses in the peace treaties. This proposal shows that the United States wants to obtain such an opinion from the International Court of Justice (where, as in all UN agencies, the US and British bloc holds a majority) that a dispute regarding the implementation of the peace treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania truly exists. The American proposal further suggests including the issue of "respect for civil rights" in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania on the agenda of the General Assembly. It is not difficult to understand that the US government, foreseeing that Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania will not allow any interference in their internal affairs in the future, is attempting to have the General Assembly adopt this proposal in order to use the cover of the UN's prestige to exert new pressure on these countries.

The main instigators who served as reactionary agitators against Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania in the committee were British representative Shawcross and Australian representative Martin. Their slander and defamation of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania only demonstrated their extreme hostility towards the people's democratic countries.

Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, and Manuilsky, head of the Ukrainian Republic delegation, both delivered lengthy speeches in the committee, thoroughly exposing the shameless conspiracy of the US and British bloc. Vyshinsky, after a detailed analysis, pointed out that the so-called "religious persecution," "violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms," and "violation of peace treaties" had all been proven to be baseless. The purpose of the slanderous attack launched by the US and British reactionary bloc is simply to stubbornly try to involve the United Nations in a movement hostile to the people's democratic countries, to use the United Nations as a tool to implement their policy of exerting pressure on other countries, to interfere in their internal affairs, to force these countries to deviate from the path of continuing to consolidate and develop democracy and socialism, and to try by all means to make them submit to the power of the US and British reactionary bloc. Vyshinsky suggested that the Special Political Committee reject the proposals of the United States, Bolivia, and Canada, because they violate the principles of the United Nations Charter and are slanderous and false attacks on the people of the three democratic countries who are building their people's democratic societies.

Representatives of other countries also expressed their opinions in the committee. Representatives of Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia all agreed with Vyshinsky's proposal.

However, on October 13, under the manipulation of the US and British bloc's majority, the committee passed the so-called "joint proposal" of the US, Bolivia, and Canada. During the vote, representatives of the Soviet Union and four other countries voted against it, and representatives of nine countries abstained.

### 美英图借联大干涉保匈罗内政　维辛斯基揭露反动阴谋  波捷等国代表主张否决美玻加联合提案

　　美英图借联大干涉保匈罗内政
  　维辛斯基揭露反动阴谋
    波捷等国代表主张否决美玻加联合提案
    【新华社北京十六日电】纽约讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会已于十月十二日结束了为期六天的关于所谓“保、匈、罗三国侵犯人权与基本自由问题”的讨论。策动这一对人民民主国家的诽谤宣传的美英反动派，本想把这个问题的讨论转变为对保、匈、罗三国人民民主政权的审判。可是，这一盘算打错了，讨论的结果反而使那些不惜采取破坏、暗杀和军事叛乱阴谋卑鄙手段以图推翻保、匈、罗三国民主政府的家伙露出本相。
    这一“问题”在联大第三届会议上曾被提出过，当时，美英集团方面在违反联合国宪章以及违反对匈保和约的托辞之下，将匈牙利人民叛徒明曾蒂以及一批保加利亚教士——美国和英国谍报机关的间谍——的审讯问题列入联大议程。
    自联大第三届大会以来，业已发现了美英间谍在这些国家中进行叛乱活动的新事实。最近匈牙利对伊拉克及其同谋者的审讯，即是明证。鉴于他们推翻人民民主国家政权的阴谋业已失败，美国与英国的反动派又再度决定利用联大的讲坛来毁谤这些国家，以便以欺骗与无稽的谴责之烟幕来掩盖美国间谍及其从仆们的罪恶活动。
    在委员会讨论这一“问题”的第一天，美国代表柯亨发言，他重复了对保、匈、罗人民民主政权的谴责老调，并提出了美国、玻利维亚和加拿大的所谓“联合”提案，建议请求联合国国际法庭对和约中的某些条款提出解释。这一提案显示美国要想得到国际法庭（在国际法庭里，正如在一切联合国机构中一样，美英集团占大多数）的这样一种意见，即关于对保、匈、罗和约履行情形的纠纷，真正是存在着的。美国的提案进而建议把保、匈、罗对“公民权利之尊重”的问题列入联大议程中。不难了解，美国政府预见到保、匈、罗将来不会允许对其内政之任何干涉，乃试图使联大通过这一提案，以便利用联合国声望的掩护来对这些国家施以新的压力。
    在委员会中充当反对保，匈、罗三国的反动叫嚣的主要挑拨者，是英国代表萧克洛斯和澳大利亚代表马丁。他们对保、匈、罗三国的诬蔑和诽谤，无非表现了他们对人民民主国家的极端仇视而已。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基和乌克兰共和国代表团团长曼努意斯基，都在委员会上发表了透彻的揭露美英集团无耻阴谋的长篇演说。维辛斯基在作了详尽的分析之后指出，所谓“迫害宗教”、“侵犯人权与基本自由”以及“违反和约”的种种谰言，都被证明是毫无根据的。而美英反动集团发起诽谤攻击的目的，只是顽固地力图把联合国卷入与人民民主国家为仇的运动中，利用联合国为工具，执行他们对其他国家施予压力的政策，干涉它们的内政，迫使这些国家乖离继续巩固和发展民主与社会主义的道路，并不择手段地力图使它们屈服于美英反动集团的势力之下。维辛斯基建议特别政治委员会否决美国、玻利维亚、加拿大的提案，因为它违背联合国宪章的原则，对三国正在建设他们人民民主社会的民主国家的人民的诽谤性的错误攻击。
    其他国家的代表，也在委员会上分别地发表了意见，白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的代表，都赞同维辛斯基的建议。
    可是，十月十三日，在美英集团的多数操纵之下，委员会竟通过了美、玻、加的所谓“联合提案”。在表决时，苏联等五国的代表投反对票，九个国家的代表弃权。
