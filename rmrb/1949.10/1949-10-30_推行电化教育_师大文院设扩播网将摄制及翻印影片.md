　　Normal University's School of Liberal Arts Establishes Broadcasting Network to Produce and Reprint Films
　　[Our Newspaper] To develop the cause of audiovisual education, the Audiovisual Education Center of Normal University plans to produce sound and color films (the center has already produced 16mm moving pictures), reprint educational films, and increase the power of the radio station to enrich broadcast content and rebroadcast Xinhua Radio programs. As a first step, a broadcasting network has been established in the School of Liberal Arts, with loudspeakers installed in various offices, classrooms, male and female dormitories, dining halls, signal rooms, cooperative, student union, and Party branch offices. Currently, it is cooperating with the student union's broadcasting team to carry out broadcast propaganda for the central tasks within the school, report on students' learning progress, and broadcast various notices from the school administration and the student union.
