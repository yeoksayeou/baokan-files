    Connects Thought to Study Policy
    Meeting Scheduled for Summary Tomorrow
    [Beijing News] The Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an expanded cadre meeting in the suburbs to arrange land reform work. On the 13th, 14th, and 15th, the meeting entered the group discussion phase. Each district enthusiastically discussed the report made by Chai Zemin, secretary of the Suburban Committee, at the general meeting. Today is a rest day, and tomorrow (17th) a summary report will be given before the meeting concludes. All groups, based on the spirit of Chai Zemin's report, connected it with personal thoughts and the actual situation of each district, raised questions for discussion. Everyone felt that in order to avoid making mistakes or making fewer mistakes in land reform, it is necessary to deeply understand the spirit of the report and be familiar with every policy in suburban land reform. In order to grasp this work and promptly understand the progress of group discussions, the Suburban Committee stipulated that on the evenings of the 13th and 15th, the district committee secretaries of each district would report to the Suburban Committee, and on the 14th, inspectors would report. The Suburban Committee will also personally supervise and inspect the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 19th districts. (Leng Lin)

　　郊区扩大干部会议进行小组讨论
    联系思想研究政策
    会议定明日作总结
    【北京讯】中共北京市委会郊区工作委员会召开之布置土地改革工作的郊区扩大干部会议，十三、十四、十五日进入小组讨论阶段，各区热烈讨论郊委书记柴泽民在大会上所作的报告，今日休息一天，明日（十七）作总结报告后即行结束。各小组皆依据柴泽民报告精神，联系个人思想及各该区实际情况，提出问题讨论，大家感到要在土改中不犯错误或少犯错误，就必须深刻领会报告的精神，熟悉郊区土改中的每一项政策。郊委为抓紧这一工作，并及时了解小组讨论情况，规定十三、十五二日晚间，各区区委书记到郊委会汇报，十四日巡视员汇报。郊委并亲自到十三、十四、十五、十九各区督促检查。　　（冷林）
