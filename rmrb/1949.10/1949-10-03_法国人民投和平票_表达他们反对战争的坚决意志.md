　　French People Cast Peace Votes
  　Expressing Their Firm Will to Oppose War
    Special Correspondent of Pravda, Zhukov
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd] TASS dispatch: Pravda published a dispatch from its Paris special correspondent Zhukov, entitled "French People Cast Peace Votes." The author wrote: The headquarters of the truly mass movement of the Association of Fighters for Peace and Freedom is located on Pyramid Road in the center of Paris. This small room is crowded with people from all districts of Paris and from all over France. The postman brings packages here twice a day. The packages contain thousands of completed ballots and many letters, each letter being evidence of the firm will of all honest French citizens to defend peace and resist the reactionary forces that are brewing a new world war. There are many touching letters among them. One reads: "I am sending you the completed ballot. I am eighty-four years old. I have experienced three wars. Curses on those who want to make our children cry again." Another letter says: "My name is Jacqueline. I was born in October 1936. According to the law, I am not yet of voting age, but to let you know that I am against war and for peace, I want to vote."
    The association now has committees in every province, and 1,500 local peace committees have begun to operate in various towns and villages. They are organizing peace votes in the provinces. In some places where organizations have not yet been established, residents have shown their initiative—they have automatically carried out the voting. Currently, the peace vote movement is being rolled out across the country. According to news from Port-de-Bouc near Marseille: Local dockworkers, bravely striking for the third month, unanimously cast their peace votes. Voting is taking place everywhere: in businesses, hospitals, markets, and private residences. In the course of the voting movement, a broad united front of the peace movement is being formed, and representatives of all classes of people have cast their peace votes. Many city and county councils have unanimously decided to actively participate in organizing the struggle for peace day. The October 2nd Peace Day movement will be of a particularly broad scale. Mass rallies, various conferences, and people's celebrations will be held across the country on that day. The undeniable achievements of the Movement of Fighters for Peace and Freedom have caused serious panic in the camp of warmongers. They understand that the outcome of the vote will be a nationwide verdict against them. Therefore, they watch the development of events with hostility, and more recently have begun to launch police offensives against those participating in the peace vote. It is said that governors of all provinces have received instructions to prevent peace voting in "public places" on the pretext that the voting is "illegal." The authorities dispatched military police to raid the places where voting was held, smashed ballot boxes, and arrested young men and women who voted. But peace-loving people remain heroic and unyielding. For example, in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris, police arrested men and women who organized peace voting on the street. When they were pushed into police cars, the crowd that gathered on the spot began to sing "La Marseillaise" and kept shouting "Long live peace!" after the cars.
    The author concluded: Seeing this situation, people are convinced that the only result of the reactionaries' use of violence against peace-loving people is that more and more people will participate in the peace vote, regardless of police suppression.

　　法国人民投和平票
  　表达他们反对战争的坚决意志
    真理报特派记者  朱可夫
    【新华社北京二日电】塔斯社讯：真理报刊载驻巴黎特派记者朱可夫的通讯，题为“法国人民投和平票”。作者写道：争取和平和自由战士协会的真正群众性的运动的总部，设于巴黎市中心金字塔路。在这里的小房间中，挤满了自巴黎各区与自全法国各地来的人群。邮差每日两次将邮包带到这里。邮包内是成千填写好了的票和许多信函，而每一封信都是一切诚实的法国公民保卫和平、反击那些酝酿新世界大战的反动力量之坚决意志的证据。其中有很多动人的信件，有一封这样写道：“我把填好了的票寄给你们，我已八十四岁了。我经历了三次战争。咀咒那些想使我们子孙再次哭泣的人。”另一信中称：“我的名字叫杰克里纳。我生于一九三六年十月。按照法律，我还未到投票的法定年龄，但为了使你知道我反对战争及拥护和平，我要投票。”
    协会现在每省均设有委员会，一千五百个地方和平委员会已在各市镇开始活动。它们在各省组织和平投票。在有些尚未展开组织的地方，居民自己显示了他们的主动——自动进行了投票。目前，和平投票运动正在全国各地展开中。据来自马赛附近莆克港口的消息称：勇敢罢工进入第三个月的当地码头工人一致投和平票。投票在企业里、医院中、市场上、私人寓所内到处进行着。在投票运动过程中，拥护和平运动的广泛统一战线正在组成中，各阶层人民的代表都投了和平票。许多市、县议会已一致决定积极参加组织争取和平争斗日，十月二日和平日运动将具特别广泛的规模，那天全国将举行群众集会，各种大会和人民庆祝大会。争取和平与自由战士运动的无可置辩的成就已引起战争贩子阵营的严重恐慌，他们了解，投票的结果将是全国对他们的判决书。因此，他们以敌对的态度注视事情的发展，近来则更开始对参加和平投票的人发动警察攻势。据称，全国各省省长已接得指令，借口投票是“非法的”，阻止在“公共场所”进行和平投票。当局出动军警袭击举行投票的地方，打毁投票箱，逮捕投票的青年男女。但热爱和平的人民仍英勇不屈。例如在巴黎第二区，警察抓捕了在街上组织和平投票的男女人民。当他们被推进警车时，当场聚集的人群便开始高唱“马赛曲”，并且一直跟着汽车连声高呼：“和平万岁！”
    作者最后写道：看到这种情形，人们深信：反动派对爱好和平的人民施以暴力的唯一结果是：将有更多更多的人民不顾警察的镇压而参加和平投票。
