Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th: Buenos Aires Dispatch: The strike movement of workers in Argentina, under the fascist Perón government, is expanding daily. According to an Associated Press report, following the strike of nearly 100,000 sugarcane and sugar refinery workers that has lasted for over ten days, 100,000 meat workers began a series of strikes on the 21st. Previously, the Perón government had adopted fascist suppression methods, declaring the strike of metallurgical workers demanding wage increases as "illegal." Meat and sugarcane are Argentina's major products, with meat being the country's main export.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th: Honolulu Dispatch: The strike of 2,000 longshoremen in Hawaii has ended in victory after 176 days of worker persistence, as the capitalists have accepted some of the workers' demands. Wages will be immediately increased from $1.40 per hour to $1.54, and further increased to $1.61 on March 1st of next year (workers originally demanded an increase of $0.32). The strike ended victoriously on the 22nd.

The strike of millions of steel, coal, and aluminum workers in the United States has not yet been resolved due to the capitalists' refusal to meet the workers' reasonable demands. According to a United Press report on the 22nd, Truman will personally intervene, attempting to invoke the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law to "end" the coal miners' strike.

　　阿根廷十万肉类工人罢工夏威夷码头工人罢工胜利
    【新华社北京二十五日电】布利诺斯艾利斯讯：在法西斯裴伦政府统治下的阿根廷工人罢工运动，日益扩大。据美联社消息，继历时已逾一旬的近十万种蔗及炼糖工人罢工之后，十万肉类工人又于二十一日开始一系列的罢工。前此裴伦政府曾采取法西斯的镇压办法，宣布冶金工人为要求增加工资的罢工为“非法”。按肉类及蔗糖为阿根廷出产大宗，肉类尤为该国的主要出口货。
    【新华社北京二十五日电】檀香山讯：夏威夷产联二千码头工人的罢工，在工人坚持一百七十六天后，因资本家已接受了工人的一部分要求，即工资由每小时一元四角立即提高到一元五角四分，至明年三月一日再提高到一元六角一分（工人原来要求增加三角二分），故已于二十二日获得胜利结束罢工。
    美国百万钢铁、煤矿和铝工人的罢工，则因资本家拒绝工人的合理要求，仍未获得解决，据合众社二十二日消息，杜鲁门将亲自出面干涉，企图援用塔夫脱——哈特莱反劳工法来“结束”煤矿工人的罢工。
