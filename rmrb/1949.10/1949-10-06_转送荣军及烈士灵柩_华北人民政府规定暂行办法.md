　　Transferring the Coffins of Revolutionary Soldiers and Martyrs
    Provisional Measures Stipulated by the North China People's Government
    [Beijing News] With the cessation of wartime service starting in October, the North China People's Government has provisionally stipulated the following measures for the transfer of revolutionary soldiers and the transfer of the coffins of martyrs: 1. For the coffins of martyrs and revolutionary soldiers requiring transfer that have been approved for transport by governments at or above the county level, the handling agency will issue travel expenses and free train transport for the coffins of martyrs (martyr's coffins are not allowed to travel by automobile), except for sections accessible by train and automobile. For sections not accessible by automobile or train, the district and village governments along the route will hire laborers to transport them. 2. The travel expenses for the transfer of revolutionary soldiers will still be covered and reimbursed by the handling agency from the handling fees. The labor hire fees will be advanced by the county government from public grain after the village and district governments obtain certificates from the revolutionary soldier or martyr's family members, and will be included in the financial reimbursement. 3. The approval and issuance of transfer documents will be managed by the government's civil affairs departments or the veteran management agencies. The labor hire fees will be managed and reimbursed by the finance departments.
