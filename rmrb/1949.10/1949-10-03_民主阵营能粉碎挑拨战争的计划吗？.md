Title: Can the Democratic Camp Crush Plans to Provoke War?

　　Reader Semenov posed this question to Pravda.
    
    Answer: After World War II, the international situation split into two sharply opposed forces: on the one hand, the camp of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union, and on the other, the camp of imperialism and war headed by the Anglo-American reactionaries. The struggle between these two camps demonstrates the steady growth of the democratic camp's strength and the gradual weakening of the imperialist camp.
    
    World War II left behind traces of immense destruction. Peace-loving people not only hate the Hitlerite bandits and Japanese militarists who launched this war, but also hate those who encouraged Hitler-style aggression and the international reactionary forces who are openly provoking a new world war today.
    
    Comrade Stalin, in his replies to questions from a Pravda correspondent, said: "Churchill, the chief instigator of a new war, has lost the trust of the democratic forces in his own country and throughout the world. All other instigators of war will suffer the same fate. The people of all countries have fresh memories of the horrors of the last war, and the forces of the masses who advocate peace are so powerful against the disciples of Churchill who are engaged in aggression that they cannot overcome this force and cannot turn this force towards a new war."
    
    World War II taught the people this lesson: it is not enough to simply oppose war; it is necessary to actively fight against all attempts to provoke new bloody slaughter.
    
    The following fact is of decisive significance for the people's victorious struggle for peace and democracy: the great Soviet Union – which saved mankind from the Hitlerite plague, and is a tireless fighter against war-mongers – is the vanguard of this struggle. At the same time, the people's democratic countries are the first-line fighters striving for peace alongside the Soviet Union. In addition, the struggle of the people of colonial and dependent countries against imperialist rule is also united with them.
    
    The workers of all countries, led by the Communist Party, selflessly defend the cause of peace. The parties of the working class, by resolutely and thoroughly defending the interests of the working people, and by constantly fighting for the freedom and independence of their countries, have won great prestige among the masses.
    
    International mass democratic organizations are the main force in the struggle against a new war. The World Federation of Trade Unions, with more than 70 million members, is a strong core uniting workers in the struggle for peace. At the same time, the Women's International Democratic Federation, with 100 million members, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth, with 500 million young men and women, are also conducting active struggles against war provocateurs.
    
    The movement protesting the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty is clear evidence of the unprecedented growth of social forces defending peace. The people of the world have firmly stated that they will never be new war tools of the imperialist bloc.
    
    The World Peace Congress was a great demonstration of the people's unity in the struggle against war provocateurs. Six hundred million people of various political persuasions sent representatives to this congress to defend the cause of world peace, to condemn the conspiracies of Anglo-American imperialism, and to fully call on the people to crush the heinous plans of the robbers' world domination. The World Peace Congress is the beginning of a new and broad movement against war.
    
    While the forces of peace and democracy are growing, the camp of imperialism and war is shrouded in wavering and terror about the future. The capitalist world is approaching a new economic crisis. The United States and its enslaved Marshall Plan countries are experiencing gradually increasing economic difficulties. The colonial world is surrounded by the flames of national liberation struggles.
    
    Under these conditions, the contradictions within the camp of Western imperialists are becoming increasingly acute. Therefore, the American imperialists who are preparing for war cannot but place special hopes on their Western European allies, and first create a revival of the German and Japanese aggressive base camps, attempting to turn Germany and Japan into the main merchants of cannon fodder. This camp of war provocation itself is divided by sharp contradictions.
    
    War-mongers try to deceive the people with malicious slander propaganda against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries; but this behavior does not get any support among the masses. Right-wing social democrats, bourgeois nationalists and other servants of the capitalists are accomplices of the imperialists in this vile matter.
    
    In September 1947, the declaration of the conference of the Communist Parties of nine European countries stated: "It must be remembered that there is a huge gap between the imperialists' ability to launch a new war and the possibility of organizing such a war. The people of the world do not want war, and the forces that maintain peace are so strong that as long as they are strong and unyielding in the cause of defending peace, as long as they are calm and firm, the aggressors' plans will be completely defeated. It should not be forgotten that the imperialist agents' clamor about the danger of war is used to scare nervous and unstable elements, and to fraudulently force them to make concessions to the aggressors."
    
    Although the camp of peace and democracy has grown into a huge force, the imperialists' adventurous policies have not eliminated the possibility of various provocations. The people's vigilance, the relentless exposure of the conspiracies of war-mongers, and further unity in the camp of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union are guarantees of striving for peace. The imperialist anti-people war plans will definitely be crushed.

### 民主阵营能粉碎挑拨战争的计划吗？

专栏：答读者问

　　民主阵营能粉碎挑拨战争的计划吗？
    读者谢门诺夫向真理报提出了这个问题。
    答：第二次世界大战以后，国际局势分成了两个尖锐对立的力量：一方面是以苏联为首的和平与民主的阵营，他方面是以英美反动派为首的帝国主义与战争的阵营。这两个阵营的斗争，显示出民主阵营力量的稳步增长及帝国主义阵营的逐渐削弱。
    第二次世界大战曾遗留下惨重破坏的痕迹。爱好和平的人民，不仅憎恨发动这次战争的希特勒匪徒及日本军阀，又加上了对于鼓舞希特勒式侵略的人们，及今日公开挑拨新的世界战争的国际反动势力的憎恨。
    斯大林同志答真理报记者问说：“挑拨新战争的头子邱吉尔，已丧失了其本国及全世界民主力量的信任。所有其他的战争挑拨者，也会遭到同样的命运。上次战争惨象，各国人民记忆犹新，主张和平的人民大众的力量，对进行侵略的邱吉尔门徒来说，是如此强大，他们战胜不了这种力量，不能把这种力量转向新的战争去。”
    第二次世界大战给予人民这样的教训：仅仅是反对战争是不够，必须积极的斗争，反对一切挑拨新血腥屠杀的企图。
    下面这个事实，对人民胜利的争取和平与民主，具有决定性意义：伟大的苏联——曾从希特勒瘟疫中救出了人类，反对战争贩子的不倦斗士——是这个斗争的先锋队。同时，人民民主国家是与苏联并肩争取和平的第一线战士，此外，殖民地与附庸国家的人民反对帝国主义统治的斗争，也与他们联合着。
    各国的工人，由共产党领导着，忘我地防御着和平事业。工人阶级的政党以坚决而彻底的保卫着劳动人民的利益，以不断的争取自己国家的自由与独立的斗争，在群众中赢得了巨大的威信。
    国际群众民主的组织，是反对新战争的斗争中的主力。超过七千万会员的世界职工会联合会，在争取和平斗争中，是团结劳动者坚强的核心。同时拥有一亿会员的世界妇女联合会及五亿男女青年的世界民主青年联合会，也进行着反战争挑拨者的积极斗争。
    抗议侵略性的北大西洋公约的运动，是保卫和平的社会力量空前增长的明确证据。全世界的人民，坚决地表示决不作帝国主义集团的新战争工具。
    世界拥护和平大会，在反对战争挑拨者的斗争中，是人民团结的大示威。各种政治信仰不同的六亿人民，都派遣了代表出席这个大会，为的是保卫世界的和平事业，斥责英美帝国主义的阴谋及全力号召人民粉碎强盗的世界统治的罪恶计划。世界拥护和平大会，是反对战争的新的广泛运动的肇始。
    当和平与民主力量正在增长的同时，帝国主义与战争阵营笼罩着对未来的动摇与恐怖。资本主义世界已临近新经济危机。美国及其所奴役的马歇尔计划诸国，已尝试着逐渐增长着的经济困难。殖民地世界被民族解放斗争的火焰所包围着。
    在这些条件下，欧美帝国主义者阵营内的矛盾日趋尖锐化。因此，准备着战争的美帝国主义者，不能不特殊嘱望于自己的西欧联盟者，和首先造成复兴德日侵略大本营，企图变德日两国为肉弹的主要贩卖商。这个挑拨战争的阵营本身，被尖锐的矛盾所分裂着。
    战争煽动者力图用恶意诽谤的宣传欺骗人民，反对苏联与人民民主国家；但这种行为，在群众中得不到任何的支持。右派社会党人、资产阶级民族主义者及其他资本家的奴仆，在这件丑恶的事情上，是帝国主义者的帮凶。
    在一九四七年九月，欧洲九国共产党会议宣言称：“必须牢记，帝国主义者之力图发动新战争与组织此种战争的可能性之间是有着巨大距离的。世界各民族不希望战争，维护和平的力量是如此强大，只要他们在保卫和平的事业中坚强不屈，只要他们沉着与坚定，侵略者的计划必遭完全失败。不应忘记，帝国主义代理人关于战争危险的叫嚣是用以恐吓神经脆弱与不稳定的分子，并以欺诈手段迫使他们对侵略者让步。”
    虽然和平与民主阵营已成长为巨大的力量，但帝国主义者的冒险政策，并没有除掉各种各样的挑衅的可能。人民的警惕，和无情地揭露战争贩子的阴谋，并进一步团结在以苏联为首的和平与民主阵营里，是争取和平的保证。帝国主义反人民战争的计划定会遭到粉碎的。
