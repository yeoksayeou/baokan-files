The Second Internal Branch追查运毒案 Further Uncovers 44 Jin of Opium

[This newspaper reported] The Second Internal Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau cracked a drug trafficking case on August 27th, seizing 1200 taels of opium. Based on clues, the branch recently uncovered an additional 44 jin of opium. After the previous case was solved, the branch, based on investigative materials, believed that a large amount of opium had not been found, so they continued to deploy manpower to investigate. When interrogating the mother of the fugitive drug dealer Zhang Xianzong, branch personnel obtained information from Zhang's relatives, stating that if Zhang's mother was released, they would voluntarily hand over 200 taels of opium. However, Zhang's mother firmly denied it. The branch sent people to Zhang's home for the first time to investigate. The Zhang family deliberately feigned poverty, with tattered clothing and equipment, and the inspectors mistakenly judged that it was impossible for them to have any opium. On October 9th, Zhang Xianzong was discovered in the eastern suburbs and brought to the bureau for questioning. Zhang even dared to make a written guarantee, stating that if opium was found in his home, he would willingly accept the death penalty by shooting. However, the investigators were not deceived by him. On October 10th, they sent people to Zhang's home again to search, and finally used probes to discover the location where opium was buried in loose ground, unearthing a total of 44 jin of opium.

　　内二分局追查运毒案
    又查获烟土四十四斤
    【本报讯】北京市公安局内二分局曾在八月二十七日破获汽车运毒案一件，查获烟土一千二百两，该局根据线索追查，近又查获烟土四十四斤。上次破案后，分局根据调查材料，尚有大量烟土未查出，故仍布置人力追查。于审讯在逃的运毒犯张显宗之母时，分局人员从张之亲属处获得材料，谓如放出张母，自愿交出烟土二百两。但张母坚不承认。分局第一次派人至张家查看，张家故意装穷，衣着设备破烂不堪，检查人员曾错误地判断为不可能存有烟土。十月九日，在东郊发见张显宗，将其带局讯问，张竟敢具结，谓如在他家发现烟土，甘愿接受枪决处分。但办案人员未受其麻痹，十月十日再派人到张家搜查，终于用探针在地面疏松处发现埋藏烟土所在地，一共起出烟土四十四斤。（内二分局通讯组）
