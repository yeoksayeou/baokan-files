　　New Life in the Art World
    ——A Record of the Inaugural Performance of the Popular Entertainment Society
    Zheng Zhong
    Your correspondent watched the inaugural performance of the Popular Entertainment Society at the People's Education Center at the Arrow Tower in Beijing. This is the overture to the new Chinese folk art, an important page in the process of folk art improvement.
    After a speech by the head of the society, Lian Runru, Cheng Guizhen (female) sang the *tiepian dagu* "Wei Bingyi Returns Home," which was an instant hit, giving the audience a brand new feeling. This was followed by Gu Rongfu and Yin Fulai's *paizi qu* "Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix," with lyrics by Wang Yaping. Coupled with their superb skills and vivid depiction, it became an example of the combination of political and artistic qualities. Cai Jinbo is a very experienced *guci* performer. Her performance of "The Liberation Army Crosses Xiaoxitian" depicts commanders and fighters braving the rain and crossing the mountains during a flash flood, using poles to guide people across, and taking off their raincoats to cover others, demonstrating a high degree of class solidarity. With her skill, she vividly depicted the entire situation of crossing the mountain. Her voice was sometimes high, sometimes low, with ups and downs, and the audience held their breath and stared intently. When the song ended, thunderous applause immediately erupted. Li Xinghai told a story of "Hou Zhaoyin Killing the Enemy to Save Her Daughter." He first explained that it was written by Li Ziqian from Shandong. The author is an old hand in the field, and the lyrics are smooth and natural, and can be sung without any modification. After listening to it, everyone felt that the lyrics were just right. More importantly, the theme is serious, truly expressing the love of the people in the liberated areas for the People's Liberation Army, as well as their anger at the Kuomintang bandit troops' burning, killing, and raping, which aroused the old hero Hou Zhaoyin to kill the enemy to save his daughter. These lyrics are a good example of folk art serving politics. The most wonderful and moving performance was Guan Xuezeng's *qinshu* "Testing the Sorceress." The story uses the village cadres designing to feign illness, the sorceress talking nonsense and wanting to make a fortune, arousing laughter from the masses, and finally the sorceress confessing, to vividly carry out the education of breaking superstitions. These lyrics were very successful, all in the language of the common people, coupled with Guan Xuezeng's vivid performance, making everyone laugh uncontrollably. In addition, there were Song Huiling's shuttlecock kicking, Yang Xiaoting's magic, and the eleven-year-old girl Wang Shuying's diabolo playing, which elicited continuous applause from the audience.
    This entertainment society has three major characteristics: First, the artists have all accepted new ideas and completely sing new lyrics. Their movements are serious, they don't say nonsense, and they honestly perform for everyone. Second, economically, they practice a cooperative system. There are no labor and capital sides. The money earned each day is divided among everyone after deducting a small amount for construction costs. There is no unreasonable disparity in treatment between artists and managers, and the backstage staff are very united. Third, in order to serve the broad masses of working people, ticket prices are particularly low: 200 for the front row, 150 for the back row, including tea money. Lian Runru, the head of the society, explained their working attitude: High ticket prices are not glorious. Good content and a large audience are the real glory. In the old society, dignitaries said that things on the "red carpet" that were exclusively for their appreciation were high art, but they regarded us artists who truly performed for the working people as "low-level." Today, we have been liberated, and we must use our unique weapons to attack reactionary ideas, and experiment with creating new folk art in the national form, scientific content, and mass direction.

　　曲艺界的新生命
    ——记大众游艺社揭幕日的公演
    郑  重
    记者在北京箭楼民教馆看了大众游艺社的首次公演。这是新中国新曲艺的序曲，是曲艺改进历程中的重要一页。
    在该社负责人连润如致辞后，首由程贵珍（女）演唱铁片大鼓“魏炳义回家”，一鸣惊人，给观众以全新的感觉。接着是顾荣甫、尹福来的牌子曲“百鸟朝凤”，曲词是王亚平作的，加上他二人纯熟的技艺，生动的描摹，成为政治性和艺术性结合的范例。蔡金波是一个很老练的鼓词名手，他说唱“解放军横过小西天”，描绘指战员在山洪暴发中冒雨过山撑杆引渡，把自己的雨衣脱下来覆盖他人，表现高度的阶级友爱。凭着她的技术，绘声绘色，活活描出了过山的全盘情况。她的嗓音时高时低，抑扬顿挫，听众一个个屏气凝神目不稍瞬，及至曲终，立时腾起雷动的掌声。李兴海说了一段“侯昭银杀敌救女记”。他首先说明这是山东李子骞编的，作者是老行家，词句顺口，非常自然，一点也没修改就可演唱。大家听了后也觉得词句恰到好处。而更重要的是主题严肃，很真切的表达出解放区农民对子弟兵的热爱，以及对国民党匪军烧杀奸淫的愤怒，激起了老英雄侯昭银杀敌救女。这曲词是曲艺为政治服务的很好例证。而最精彩动人的则是关学曾的琴书“考神婆”。用村干部设计装病，神婆信口胡说想发洋财，引起群众大笑，最后神婆坦白的故事，来生动的进行破除迷信的教育。这个鼓词写得非常成功，都是老百姓话，加上关学曾的生动说唱，使大家笑得合不拢口。此外还有宋慧玲的踢毽，杨筱亭的魔术，十一岁小姑娘王淑英的抖空竹等精技，观众掌声不绝。
    这个游艺社有三大特点：第一、是艺人都接受了新思想完全演唱新词，动作严肃，不说废话，老老实实的为大家演唱。第二、经济上实行合作制，没有劳方和资方，每天收入的钱除出少数建设费外大家分批，艺人和管理人员没有不合理的悬殊待遇，前后台人员非常团结。第三、为了给广大劳动人民服务，票价特别低廉，前排二百，后排一百五，水钱在内。该社负责人连润如说明他们的工作态度：票价贵不是光荣，内容好、观众多才是真正的光荣。旧社会的达官贵人说专供他们欣赏的“红氍＠”上的东西才是高级艺术，却把我们真正为劳动人民演唱的艺人目为“低级”。今天我们得到了解放，要用我们特有的武器，向反动思想进攻，实验创作民族的形式、科学的内容、大众的方向的新曲艺。
