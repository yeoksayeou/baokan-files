Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th -- According to a TASS dispatch from Berlin: The German people warmly welcomed Stalin's congratulatory telegram to Wilhelm Pieck, President, and Otto Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic.

　　On October 15th, rallies were held in the majority of enterprises in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany to celebrate Stalin's congratulatory telegram.

　　The Central Committee of the Free German Trade Union Federation of Mecklenburg, representing 400,000 members, sent a telegram to Stalin stating: The Soviet Union's unwavering policy of peace has enabled the progressive forces of Germany to form a provisional democratic government. The Anti-Fascist Democratic Alliance of Mecklenburg also sent its respects to Stalin in a telegram.

　　A statement issued by the Democratic Peasants' Party pointed out: "Marshal Stalin's words not only acknowledge the work completed so far by the democratic and progressive forces in Germany, but also encourage all people to build and consolidate a truly democratic and unified Germany, and encourage the people to maintain peace."

　　A statement issued by the Farmers' Mutual Aid Committee of Saxony, representing 120,000 farmers, pointed out: "Marshal Stalin's congratulatory telegram once again proves that the Soviet Union is a true friend of Democratic Germany. Marshal Stalin's words give farmers confidence that they can peacefully cultivate their land."

　　The Executive Committee of the German Democratic Women's League issued a statement stating: "Stalin's trust in the democratic forces of the German people places upon us the responsibility to strive with even greater energy than before for a unified, democratic Germany."

　　Stalin's congratulatory telegram and the German government's reply have not only aroused great joy among various political parties, organizations, workers, and staff in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, but have also received a broad response among the people of West Germany. In the Western occupied zones, the Stuttgart "People's Opinion" newspaper published an extra edition of Stalin's congratulatory telegram. The extra edition was immediately sold out. The industrial committees of various enterprises in Southern Germany declared: Stalin's congratulatory telegram, in addition to demonstrating friendship, also places new tasks before the people of West Germany. Many members of the North Rhine-Westphalia state parliament believe that Stalin's congratulatory telegram is a new basis for the Germans in West Germany not to evade the struggle for German unification and the struggle for peace.

    【新华社北京十八日电】据塔斯社柏林讯：德国人民热烈欢迎斯大林致德意志民主共和国皮克总统与格罗提渥总理的贺电。
    十月十五日，在德境苏占区的大多数企业中，都举行了大会，庆祝斯大林的贺电。
    梅格棱堡州自由德国职工会联合会中央委员会代表四十万会员致电斯大林称：苏联始终不渝的和平政策，使德国的进步力量得以组成临时民主政府。梅格棱堡反法西斯民主同盟也电斯大林致敬。
    民主农民党发表声明指出：“斯大林大元帅的话，不仅是承认民主与进步力量在德国迄今所已完成的工作，而且鼓励全体人民建设和巩固真正的民主统一的德国，鼓励人民保持和平。”
    萨克森州农民互助委员会代表十二万农民发表的声明指出：“斯大林大元帅的贺电，再一次地证明苏联是民主德国的真正友人。斯大林大元帅的话，给了农民以信心，相信他们能够和平地耕种他们的土地。”
    德国民主妇女联盟执行委员会发表声明称：“斯大林对于德国人民民主力量的信任，使我们有责任以较前更大的精力为统一的民主的德国而斗争”。
    斯大林的贺电与德国政府的复电，不仅在德国苏占区各政党、团体和工人职员中引起很大的高兴，而且也在西德人民中间得到了广大的反应。在西占区，斯图加特的人民舆论报发行了斯大林贺电的号外。号外立即销售一空。南德各企业的工业委员会宣称：斯大林的贺电，除了证明友谊而外，并将新的任务摆在西德人民的面前。北莱因——威斯特伐利亚州议会的许多议员认为，斯大林的贺电乃是西德的德国人不应回避为争取德国统一及争取和平的斗争的新的根据。
