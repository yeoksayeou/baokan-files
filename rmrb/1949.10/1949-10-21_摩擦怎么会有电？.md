How Does Friction Generate Electricity?
A lecture by Xue Qin, Associate Professor of Physics, College of Science, National Peking University.

　　Yesterday we talked about how anything generates electricity when rubbed. For example, amber generates electricity when rubbed with a silk cloth. Now, we want to ask: How does amber generate electricity when rubbed? Is it that amber inherently contains electricity? That it doesn't show up until it's rubbed? Is there some other reason? What exactly is the source of electricity? To talk about the source of electricity, we must talk about electrons.

　　What are electrons? Originally, any object can be divided into smaller objects by mechanical means, and can be further divided into even smaller objects. Continuing to divide in this way, the object can be divided very finely, but to a certain degree of fineness, it can no longer be divided. We call this fine and indivisible thing a molecule. For example, if we grind a piece of iron into iron powder, and then divide each grain of iron powder until it can no longer be divided, we get a molecule of iron. Molecules are things that cannot be further divided by mechanical means. However, according to other methods, that is, the results of chemical methods of research, we also know that the molecules of any substance are composed of one or several, one or dozens of atoms combined together. For example, a water molecule contains two of the lightest atoms, called hydrogen atoms, and an atom that is sixteen times heavier than a hydrogen atom, called an oxygen atom. Now we know that there are ninety-some different kinds of atoms in the universe. All objects are properly coordinated and organized by different kinds and numbers of atoms. The atomic bomb we often talk about is made by using a metal atom called uranium or plutonium from these ninety-some atoms. Inside the atom is a positively charged core called the atomic nucleus. At the center of the atom, there are one or dozens of negatively charged things called electrons, rotating around the atomic nucleus, just as the Earth and other planets revolve around the sun. The atomic nucleus is relatively heavy and not easily moved, and the electrons are extremely light and rotate very quickly. Due to the different weight of the atomic nucleus and the amount of positive electricity, there are different things such as oxygen, light gas, gold, silver, copper, iron, and so on. Usually, in an atom, the amount of positive electricity carried by the atomic nucleus is equal to the amount of negative electricity carried by the electrons around the atomic nucleus, so there is no charge phenomenon. If an atom lacks electrons, it carries a positive charge; if it has too many electrons, it carries a negative charge. Therefore, whether an object is charged or not depends entirely on electrons.

　　Okay, now I can tell you the reason why friction generates electricity. Originally, everything contains atoms, that is to say, everything contains positively charged atomic nuclei and negatively charged electrons, but in ordinary atoms, the negative and positive electricity are equal, so there is no charged phenomenon. But if an object doesn't have enough electrons, it carries a positive charge; if it has too many electrons, it carries a negative charge. When amber and silk are rubbed together, the electrons on the silk handkerchief attach to the amber. The silk has fewer electrons, so it carries a positive charge; the amber has more electrons, so it carries a negative charge. Similarly, when a glass rod and a silk handkerchief are rubbed together, the electrons on the surface of the glass are wiped off by the silk handkerchief. The glass rod lacks electrons, so it carries a positive charge; the silk handkerchief has too many electrons, so it carries a negative charge. Which one of the two things carries a positive charge and which one carries a negative charge when they are rubbed together completely depends on how tightly the electrons are bound in the atoms of each thing. That is to say, it depends on the properties of the two substances.

　　In ordinary atoms, the atomic nucleus attracts the electrons around it, only allowing these electrons to spin around the atomic nucleus. Only when an external force invades can those electrons that are far away from the atomic nucleus run away. In some things, electrons can run very quickly, and electrons can move freely inside. We call this kind of thing a conductor. In some things, electrons do not move easily inside. We call it an insulator. So the difference between conductors and insulators only indicates the degree to which electrons can move inside. Generally, electrons are easy to move in metals, so metals are good conductors. Electrons are most difficult to move in amber, so amber is a good insulator.

　　Electrons can move freely in our bodies, which means that our bodies are also conductors. Usually when our hands touch the wire, we feel a tingling sensation because the electrons on the wire pass through our bodies and into the ground. This kind of electric shock is sometimes very dangerous. If we stand on dry wooden tables and chairs and then touch the wire, the electrons cannot pass through these objects. The electrons that first come to our body cannot pass through, and the ones behind will not continue to come, so we will not be electrocuted.

　　In the summer, when we walk in the plains and wilderness, and suddenly a thunderstorm comes, we have to be careful, because we are very likely to be struck by lightning. Because if a charged cloud, say a positively charged cloud, passes over our heads, the electrons on the ground are attracted to the surface of this land by the positive electricity on this cloud. Our bodies protrude from the ground and are closer to the clouds, so the electrons on the ground will run from our bodies and neutralize with the positive electricity in the clouds. If the clouds and the ground are very close, the spark of lightning may appear on our heads, you can imagine how dangerous this is? Some people are killed by lightning for this reason. Our bodies and the ground were originally uncharged, that is to say, there are neither too many nor too few electrons, just enough to equal the positive electricity in the atomic nucleus. Now, because a charged cloud is close to us, our bodies and the ground are charged. We call this method of charging induction charging. An object that was originally uncharged is placed next to a charged object, and the electrons inside it are attracted or repelled by the charged body, and run to one end of the object. So one end has too many electrons and carries a negative charge, and the other end lacks electrons and carries a positive charge. This is the reason for induction charging.

　　There is also a story about induction generating electricity that makes children swing, which is very interesting. Let me introduce it to everyone. It is said that a child lies on a wooden board, and the wooden board is hung on the ceiling with a rope. First, let the child stand still, then use a glass rod rubbed with a silk handkerchief to get close to the child's feet. The electrons in the child's body are attracted by the positive electricity on the glass rod, and run to the feet. The feet have too many electrons and carry a negative charge, and the head lacks electrons and carries a positive charge. The glass rod is too far away from the head, and the repulsive force between them is very small. The glass rod is very close to the feet, and the attractive force between them is very large. As a result, the child is attracted to the glass rod a little bit. The distance attracted each time is very small. It is said that after patiently experimenting and attracting several times, the child will start to swing.

　　摩擦怎么会有电？
    国立北京大学理学院物理系副教授薛琴讲
    我们昨天已经讲过，什么东西摩擦都会有电。好比琥珀在绸衣服上摩擦就会有电。现在我们要问一问摩擦琥珀怎么会有电呢？是不是琥珀里面本来就有电？不经过摩擦显不出电来，摩擦以后它就显出电来了？还是有其他的原因呢？电的来源究竟是怎么一回事呢？讲到电的来源，我们必需讲讲电子。
    什么是电子呢？原来任何物体都可以用机械的方法分割成更小的物体，还可以再分割成更小更小的物体，这样继续分下去，就可以把物体分得很细微，但是细微到一定的程度就不能再分了，这个细微而不能再分的东西，我们管它叫分子。好比我们把一块铁，辗磨成铁粉，每一粒铁粉再分割，分得细微得不能再分了，我们就得到了铁的分子。分子是用机械方法不能再分的东西。但是根据别的方法，就是化学方法研究的结果，我们又知道任何物质的分子是由一种或几种一个或几十个原子结合起来的。好比水分子里面就有两个最轻的原子，叫做氢原子，和一个比氢原子重十六倍的原子叫作氧原子。现在我们知道宇宙间一共有九十几种不同种类的原子，一切物体都是由种类不同、数目不同的原子适当配合组织起来的。我们常常说的原子弹，就是利用这九十多种原子中一种叫做铀或镨金属原子制造成的。原子里面有一个带阳电的核心，叫做原子核，在原子的中心，有一个或几十个带阴电的东西，叫做电子，围绕着原子核旋转，就好象地球和其他行星围绕着太阳旋转一样，原子核比较重，不容易活动，电子轻极了，转动起来很快。由于原子核的轻重和阳电的多少不同，而有养气轻气、金、银、铜、铁等等不同的东西。平常在一个原子中，原子核所带的阳电，和原子核周围电子所带的阴电数量是相等的，所以不呈带电现象。要是一个原子的电子缺乏，它就带阳电，电子过多，他就带阴电，所以一个物体带电不带电，完全要看电子来决定。
    好了，现在我可以告诉诸位摩擦会有电的原因了。原来什么东西里面都有原子，也就是说什么东西里面都有带阳电的原子核和带阴电的电子，不过在平常的原子中阴阳电是相等的，所以不呈带电现象。但是要是物体的电子不够，它就带阳电，要是电子过多它就带阴电。琥珀和绢绸摩擦的时候，绢绸手巾上的电子就附着在琥珀上，绢绸上的电子少了，所以就带阳电，琥珀上电子多了，所以就带阴电。同样，玻璃棒和绢绸手巾摩擦的时候，玻璃表面的电子被绢绸手巾擦掉了，玻璃棒上的电子缺乏，所以就带了阳电；绢绸手巾上的电子过多，所以就带了阴电。两种东西摩擦，究竟那一种东西带阳电那一种东西带阴电，这完全要看电子在哪一种东西里的原子内结合的松紧情形来决定。也就是说要看两物质的性质来决定。
    在平常的原子里，原子核吸引着它周围的电子，只许这些电子在原子核的周围打转，只有在一旦外力侵犯的时候，那些离原子核远一点的电子才能跑掉。在有些东西里，电子可以跑得很快，电子在里面可以自由活动，这种东西，我们叫它导体。有些东西，电子在里面不容易活动，我们管它叫绝缘体。所以导体和绝缘体的分别，只不过表示电子在里面活动的程度不同吧了。大概金属里的电子容易活动，所以金属是良好的导体，电子在琥珀内最难活动，所以琥珀是良好的绝缘体。
    电子在我们的身体里可以自由活动，这就是说，我们的身体也是导体，平常我们的手触着电线，觉得麻一下，这是因为电线上的电子从我们的身体通过，通到地里。这种触电，有时是很危险的。要是我们站在干木头桌椅上再触电线，电子不能够从这些物体上通过，先来到我们身体里的电子过不去，后面也就不继续来了，我们就不会触了电。
    夏天我们走到平原旷野的时候，忽然雷雨来了，我们的衣服被雨淋湿了，这时我们得当心，很有被电打的可能，因为要是一朵带电的云，比方说一朵带阳电的云吧，从我们头上过去的时候，地上的电子就被这朵云上的阳电吸引到这块地的表面上来了。我们的身体突出地面，更接近云彩，地面上的电子，就都会从我们的身体，跑上去和云端的阳电中和。要是云彩和地面非常接近时，电闪的火花可能就在我们头上出现，你想这是多么危险啊？有些人被雷打死就是这样的原因。我们的身体和地面原来是不带电的，就是说电子不多不少，恰恰能够和原子核内阳电相等，现在因为带电的云靠近我们时，我们的身体和地面就带了电，这种带电的方法，我们管它叫感应带电，一个本来是不带电的物体，放在一个带电的物体的旁边，他内部的电子受了带电体的吸引或排斥，就跑到物体的一端去了，所以一端电子过多，就带阴电，另外一端电子缺乏就带阳电。这就是感应带电的原因。
    还有一个感应生电使小孩子打秋千的故事，非常有趣，让我来介绍给大家。据说一个小孩子躺在一块木板上，木板用绳挂在天花板上，先让小孩静止不动，然后用绢绸手巾摩擦过的玻璃棒，靠近小孩的脚，小孩身体内的电子受了玻璃棒上的阳电吸引，就跑到脚上来，脚上电子过多就带了阴电，头上电子缺乏就带了阳电，玻璃棒距离头部太远，它们互相排斥的力量很小，玻璃棒距离足部很近，他们互相吸引的力量很大，结果小孩就被玻璃棒吸引过去了一点，一次吸引过去的距离很小，据说耐心的试验吸引若干次后，小孩就会打起秋千来了。
