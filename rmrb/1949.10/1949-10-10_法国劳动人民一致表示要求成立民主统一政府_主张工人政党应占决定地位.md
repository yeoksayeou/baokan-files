Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: TASS, Paris, 8th: Following the resignation of the Queuille government, which pursued anti-labor and anti-democratic policies, the working people of France are enthusiastically demanding the establishment of a democratic and unified government. Numerous enterprises, including workers in Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Toulon, Courneuve, Gennevilliers, and other towns, the Inland Soldiers Association, the Free Shooters Association, the French Guerrilla Fighters Association, the French Young Women's Union, the General Federation of Public Health Agency Employees, the French Women's League, the General Agricultural Association, the Trade Union Confederation of Alpes-Maritimes, the "Grande Combe" Coal Mine Union, and the Toulon Gas and Electricity Industry Union, and other public democratic groups and parties, have all passed resolutions demanding the establishment of a democratic and unified government. The factory workers of the National Aircraft Engine Manufacturing and Design Association in Suresnes stated in their resolution that they oppose the establishment of a government that implements policies that violate the interests of the working people and the revival of the French economy, and advocate the establishment of a government that guarantees the full utilization of production equipment for peaceful purposes and satisfies the legitimate demands of the working people. At a meeting, 1,600 workers from the No. 10 coal mine in the "Gouリエ" mining area passed a resolution demanding "the establishment of a democratic and unified government in which the working class and its parties occupy a decisive position." Workers in many enterprises in Lyon and Villeurbanne in the Rhône region went on strike on the 6th, demanding the establishment of a democratic and unified government. On the same day, twenty-three delegations from all walks of life also visited the Villeurbanne City Council for the same purpose. Metal workers in the 7th, 15th, and 16th districts of Paris demanded in their resolutions "the establishment of a democratic government that implements a policy of peace, meets the demands of the workers, and forces the financial tycoons and the wealthy to contribute money."
