Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 30th: TASS Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet government sent a note to the Yugoslav government on September 28th, announcing the abolition of the Soviet-Yugoslav Treaty. The note was delivered by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko when he met with the Yugoslav Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to the Soviet Union. The note reads as follows:

"The trial of the traitors and spies (who are also spies of the Yugoslav government) Rajk and his accomplices, which concluded in Budapest on September 24th, shows that the Yugoslav government, under the false pretense of “friendship” with the Soviet Union, has long been carrying out hostile subversive activities against the Soviet Union. The Budapest trial also shows that the leaders of the Yugoslav government, not only on their own initiative but also according to the direct instructions of foreign imperialist groups, have carried out and continue to carry out hostile and subversive work against the Soviet Union.

The facts revealed in this trial show that the current Yugoslav government has completely become subordinate to foreign imperialist groups and has become a tool of the group’s aggressive policies, a fact that inevitably leads to and has already led to the cancellation of the sovereignty and independence of the Yugoslav Republic.

"All these facts show that the Soviet-Yugoslav Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation concluded on April 11, 1945, has been brazenly trampled upon and torn up by the current Yugoslav government.

"Based on the above reasons, the Soviet government declares that the Soviet Union considers itself no longer bound by the obligations undertaken by the aforementioned treaty.

　　　　　　　　
　　　Deputy Foreign Minister of the Soviet Government, Gromyko.”

　　苏声明废除苏南条约
    铁托政府已成为帝国主义侵略工具匈京审讯确证其对苏进行颠覆活动
    【新华社北京三十日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府九月二十八日致南斯拉夫政府照会一件，宣布废除苏南条约。照会由苏联副外长葛罗米柯接见南斯拉夫驻苏临时代办时递交下列照会：
    “九月二十四日在布达佩斯结束的对叛国犯与间谍（同时也是南斯拉夫政府的间谍）拉伊克及其同谋者审讯的过程显示：南斯拉夫政府早就在对苏“友好”这一虚伪的声明掩盖之下，对苏联进行敌对的颠覆活动。布达佩斯审讯也显示：南斯拉夫政府的领袖们不仅按照其自己的倡议，并且也按照外国帝国主义集团的直接训令而对苏联进行了并且继续进行着敌对与颠覆工作。
    这次审讯所显露的事实表明：南斯拉夫现政府已完全附属于外国帝国主义集团且已成为该集团侵略政策的工具，这一事实必定导向而且实际上已经导向取消南斯拉夫共和国的主权和独立。
    “这一切事实说明：一九四五年四月十一日缔结的苏南友好互助与战后合作条约已被南斯拉夫现政府蛮横地践踏和撕毁了。
    “基于上述理由，苏联政府声明：苏联认为今后不受由上述条约而承担的义务的约束。　　　　　　　　
　　　苏联政府代表副外长葛罗米柯。”
