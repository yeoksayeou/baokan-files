  　Pingxiang-Liling Section Opens to Traffic
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 22nd: The Pingxiang (Jiangxi) to Liling (Hunan) section of the Zhe-Gan Railway has been repaired and officially opened to traffic on October 10th. Trains traveling west can now go directly from Pingxiang to Zhuzhou. Thus, only the Zhangshuzhen to Pingxiang section of the entire Zhe-Gan Railway remains to be repaired. The Zhang-Ping section is 200 kilometers long, and among the 19 bridges along the way, the Gan River Bridge and a bridge on the Gan River interchange have not been repaired since they were destroyed during the War of Resistance Against Japan. The rest of the bridges, stations large and small, and the railway lines were mostly destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit gangs before liberation. The Repair Project Office for this section was established on October 2nd under the order of the Shanghai Railway Administration. The Project Office has three engineering teams which will repair the section in stages and work has already begun. The railway workers are enthusiastically responding to the call of Minister Teng Daiyuan of the Ministry of Railways in his report at the National Engineering Conference that the “Zhang-Ping section must be opened to traffic by December 15th,” and are determined to strive to complete the task of opening the entire Zhe-Gan line to traffic as scheduled.

　　浙赣路
  　萍醴段通车
    【新华社南昌二十二日电】浙赣路江西萍乡至湖南醴陵一段业经修复，已于十月十日正式通车。西开列车可由萍乡直达株州。至此，浙赣铁路全线仅樟树镇至萍乡的一段尚待修复。樟萍段全长二百公里，沿途十九座桥梁除赣江大桥和赣江交流上的一座桥是抗日战争中被破坏后迄未修复者外，都是这次解放前被国民党匪帮破坏的。大小车站和线路也大部遭受破坏。该段修复工程处已奉上海铁路管理局命令于十月二日成立，工程处下设三个工程队，分段抢修，刻已动工。修路员工正热烈响应铁道部滕代远部长在全国工务会议上的报告中所提的“樟萍段要在十二月十五日通车”的号召，决心争取如期完成浙赣全线通车的任务。
