　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: According to TASS, Paris, 23rd, the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress held a meeting presided over by Joliot-Curie. It discussed the attitude of the Yugoslav National Committee towards the international peace movement and unanimously adopted a resolution on this issue. The resolution first pointed out that the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress has concluded that the activities of the Yugoslav National Committee show, in terms of propaganda, complete obedience to the policies of the Yugoslav government.

　　The resolution pointed out the following policies of Yugoslavia: First, the Yugoslav government has openly embarked on a path of increasingly blatant hostile actions against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, obtaining political and financial assistance from the governments of Washington and London on the one hand, and opposing the peace calls of hundreds of millions of men and women around the world on the other. Second, the Yugoslav government uses fascist-style repression and terror to deal with peace advocates within Yugoslavia who oppose its policies. Third, the Yugoslav government aids the Athens Royal Fascist government in attacking the patriots of democratic Greece. Fourth, the Yugoslav government is pursuing a policy of intimidating Albania and threatening the independence of this small country; it threatens to send Yugoslav armed forces against Albania and gives foreign countries interference and excuses. Fifth, as shown in Tito's recent speech on military exercises, Yugoslavia is attempting to prepare public opinion for the possibility of war. For this purpose, the Tito government condemns those countries that defend peace as harboring warlike purposes, while supporting those governments that, under the guise of defending peace, form aggressive weapons such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

　　The resolution stated: These conspiracies and propaganda of the Yugoslav government are exactly what the representatives of various countries attending the World Peace Congress wholeheartedly vowed to expose and fight against. However, the leaders and organizations of the Yugoslav Peace Committee, while claiming that they are fighting for peace together with the Standing Committee, unconditionally support the war-provoking policies pursued by their government.

　　The resolution stated: The Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee has learned of the resolutions of the national peace committees of Italy, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, as well as letters from the members of the Standing Committee in France, Britain, Greece, Portugal, and Brazil. All these letters and resolutions are accompanied by protests against the existing Yugoslav Peace Committee, believing that the committee cannot represent the true peace movement in Yugoslavia. These letters and resolutions request the Standing Committee to sever relations with the current Yugoslav Committee and request that the leaders of the committee, Mr. Mindrovic and Mr. Vidmar, not be allowed to attend the Standing Committee meeting scheduled to be held in Rome on October 28, 29, and 30.

　　The resolution finally declared: The Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress is committed to the struggle to support and further develop the struggle for peace as stipulated in the declaration of the World Peace Congress, and to expand the unity of all organizations and individuals who support this struggle. The Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee has passed the following resolution: First, only Yugoslav representatives who provide assurances of complete independence from the Yugoslav government will be allowed to attend the meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress to be held in Rome. Second, this independence can only be demonstrated by denouncing the militaristic policies and war propaganda of the Tito government as indicated in this resolution.

　　世界和大常委会执行局决议　
    与南国和委会继绝关系           
    指出该委会活动服务铁托战争政策
    【新华社北京二十六日电】据塔斯社巴黎二十三日讯：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会执行局在约里奥·居里主持下举行会议。讨论南斯拉夫全国委员会对国际和平运动的态度，并一致通过关于这一问题的决议，决议首先指出：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会执行局已得出结论，即南斯拉夫全国委员会的活动，在宣传上表现出完全服从于南斯拉夫政府的政策。
    决议指出南斯拉夫的政策如下：第一，南斯拉夫政府已公开地走上对苏联和人民民主国家采取日益露骨的敌对行动的道路。一方面取得华盛顿和伦敦政府政治上和财政上的援助，一方面反对全世界数以亿计的男女的和平呼声。第二，南斯拉夫政府用法西斯式的镇压和恐怖，对付南国国内反对其政策的和平拥护者。第三，南斯拉夫政府援助雅典保皇法西斯政府，进攻民主希腊的爱国者。第四，南斯拉夫政府执行着恫吓阿尔巴尼亚、威胁这个小国的独立的政策；它威胁着要派遣南斯拉夫武装部队对付阿国，并给外国以干涉和借口。第五，如最近铁托关于军事演习的演说所显示的，南斯拉夫正企图为战争的可能性准备舆论。为着这一目的，铁托政府谴责那些保卫和平的国家怀有好战的目的，而拥护那些在保卫和平的借口下组成如北大西洋公约这种侵略武器的政府。
    决议称：南斯拉夫政府这些阴谋和宣传正是出席世界拥护和平大会的各国代表们全心全意地誓言要加以揭露并与之进行斗争的。然而，南斯拉夫和平委员会的领导者和团体，一方面表示他们正与常设委员会一同进行争取和平的斗争，同时却又无条件地拥护其政府所奉行的挑拨战争的政策。
    决议称：常设委员会执行局已获悉意大利、捷克斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚全国和平委员会的决议，及常设委员会在法国、英国、希腊、葡萄牙、巴西诸国的委员们的来函。所有这一切函件与决议均附有对现存的南斯拉夫和平委员会的抗议，认为该委员会并不能代表南斯拉夫真正的和平运动。这些函件与决议要求常设委员会与现在的南斯拉夫委员会断绝关系，并且要求不准该委员会领导者明德罗维奇与维德马尔先生出席定于十月二十八、二十九、三十日在罗马召开的常设委员会会议。
    决议最后宣称：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会执行局致力于世界拥护和平大会宣言所规定的支持与进一步发展争取和平的斗争，并扩大拥护这个斗争的一切组织与个人的团结。常设委员会执行局业已通过如下的决议：第一，只有提出完全脱离南斯拉夫政府而独立的保证的南斯拉夫代表，才准予出席在罗马召开的世界拥护和平大会常设委员会会议。第二，这种独立性只有对本决议中所指出的铁托政府的军国主义政策与战争宣传加以痛斥，才能表现出来。
