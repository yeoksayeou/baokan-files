    [Report from this newspaper] Southward transportation of flour and northward transportation of coal signifies that material exchange between the North and South is becoming increasingly vigorous. Regarding the northward transportation of flour, the North China Grain Company has successively ordered 400,000 bags of flour from Shanghai. The first batch of 200,000 bags has been shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin from September to October 15th, as previously reported in this newspaper. The second batch of 200,000 bags is scheduled to be shipped to Tianjin within three months from October to December. Regarding the southward transportation of coal, since the direct train service between Beijing and Shanghai began, North China coal has been continuously shipped out to supply Shanghai, Nanjing, and other cities in the Jiangnan region. Since October, to meet seasonal needs, the North China Coal and Iron Company has been shipping Kailuan coal to Pukou via three trains daily for transshipment to Nanjing and Shanghai, with a monthly volume reaching over 100,000 tons. The company has also signed a contract with the Changcheng Coal Mine to transport and sell their stored coal to Shanghai through a cooperative arrangement.
