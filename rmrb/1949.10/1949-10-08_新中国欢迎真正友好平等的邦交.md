After the Soviet government established diplomatic relations with the Central People's Government of our country, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, North Korea, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and other countries have also successively established diplomatic relations with our country. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai has replied to each with a message of welcome, which fully conforms to the wishes of the people of our country.

The Chinese people have their own diplomatic principles. As early as before the end of World War II, Chairman Mao Zedong clearly pointed out in "On Coalition Government": "To establish and consolidate diplomatic relations with all countries and resolve all wartime and post-war mutual relations on the basis of thoroughly eliminating Japanese aggressors, defending world peace, mutually respecting national independence and equal status, and mutually promoting the interests and friendship of countries and peoples." Except for some wartime relations that have become a thing of the past due to the end of World War II and the victory of China's War of Resistance Against Japan, its fundamental principles are still fully applicable today, and have been more clearly stipulated in Chapter VII of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which has been accepted by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China as its policy. This was proclaimed even more clearly in the Central People's Government's announcement on October 1st.

In the aforementioned Common Program, it was declared that "The People's Republic of China unites with all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and peoples in the world, especially with the Soviet Union, all People's Democratic countries, and oppressed nations, stands on the side of the international peace and democracy camp, and jointly opposes imperialist aggression in order to guarantee lasting world peace." Now, it is precisely the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries that we must first unite with that have decided to establish diplomatic relations with our country. In the great democratic peace camp led by the Soviet Union, the Chinese people and the people of all People's Democratic countries have always been united in spirit and action, but due to the obstruction of imperialism and its employed Kuomintang bandit gangs, we have been unable to establish diplomatic relations with various countries for a long time. Now the situation is completely different. The Chinese people have completely cleared the obstacles to further strengthening friendship and cooperation between our country and other countries. During the meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and after the establishment of the Central People's Government, we have constantly received enthusiastic congratulatory messages from friends of various countries, which has made us feel even more that we are not isolated. Now, starting from the Soviet Union, notes wishing to establish diplomatic relations with our country are constantly flying in, further confirming what Chairman Mao said in his opening speech at the People's Political Consultative Conference: Our friends are all over the world.

The notes from Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, North Korea, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and other countries all mentioned that the victory of the Chinese people is the victory of the world's forces for peace, and mentioned the commonality of the great ideals of our country and the various ethnic groups of these countries. This shows that it is by no means accidental that these countries first established diplomatic relations with our country. Once these diplomatic relations are established, they will inevitably be increasingly consolidated and become a good foundation for the development of economic, political, and cultural relations between China and these countries, and become a huge force for safeguarding world peace.

As we have always promoted, we welcome the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, various oppressed national countries, and our country, and at the same time, we do not refuse any other country to establish diplomatic relations with our country on the principles of equality, friendship, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty.

On November 21st of last year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a statement explaining our solemn position on safeguarding the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, and declared: "The Communist Party of China, the People's Democratic Government of the Chinese Liberated Areas, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are willing to establish equal and friendly relations with all foreign countries, including the United States, and protect all legitimate interests of foreign nationals in China, including American nationals; but the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty must be maintained and not subject to any aggression." On April 30th of this year, General Li Tao, spokesperson for the headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, also mentioned this point in a statement regarding the incident of the British warship Amethyst, and declared: "If a foreign government is willing to consider establishing diplomatic relations with us, it must sever relations with the Kuomintang remnant forces and withdraw its armed forces from China." What we oppose is only the imperialist system and its conspiracy against the Chinese people, while the establishment of diplomatic relations on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty is unanimously welcomed by the people of our country and the people of all countries. We are very happy to read the statement of the Political Committee of the British Communist Party on September 23rd and the congratulatory telegram from the leaders of the American Communist Party to Chairman Mao Zedong on the 3rd of this month. They all talked about how the people of their countries are urgently demanding that their respective current governments establish equal and mutually beneficial diplomatic and commercial relations with the new China. British businessmen are also making such demands of their government. They all believe that this is one of the important ways to alleviate the profound suffering of the masses of their own people caused by the developing economic crisis in their countries. The rulers of the United States and Britain should learn some lessons from the great changes that have taken place in the East. As long as they sever relations with the Kuomintang reactionaries and adopt a genuine rather than hypocritical friendly attitude towards the new China of the people, we are willing to negotiate with them on the issue of establishing diplomatic relations on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty.

The Chinese people have stood up, the era of unequal treaties has ended, and the Chinese people welcome all countries that truly treat me with equality to establish diplomatic relations with our country, and welcome truly friendly and equal diplomatic relations.

### 新中国欢迎真正友好平等的邦交

　　新中国欢迎真正友好平等的邦交
    苏联政府与我国中央人民政府建立外交关系之后，保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、朝鲜、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰等国亦相继与我国建立外交关系，周恩来外长已分别复电表示欢迎，这完全符合于我国人民的意愿。
    中国人民是有自己的外交原则的。早在第二次世界大战结束之前，毛泽东主席在“论联合政府”中就已明确指出：“在彻底消灭日本侵略者，保卫世界和平，互相尊重国家的独立与平等地位，互相增进国家与人民的利益及友谊这些基础之上，和各国建立和巩固邦交，解决一切战时战后的相互关系问题。”其中除若干战时的关系由于第二次世界大战的结束与中国抗日战争的胜利而成为过去以外，其根本原则至今仍然完全适用，而且都已在中华人民共和国中央人民政府已接受为施政方针的中国人民政协共同纲领第七章中有了更明确的规定。在中央人民政府十月一日的公告中有了更明白的宣告。
    在上述共同纲领中，宣告了“中华人民共和国联合世界上一切爱好和平、自由的国家和人民，首先是联合苏联、各人民民主国家和被压迫民族，站在国际和平民主阵营方面，共同反对帝国主义侵略，以保障世界的持久和平。”现在，首先决定和我国建立外交关系的就正是我们首先要联合的苏联和各人民民主国家。在苏联所领导的伟大的民主和平阵营中，中国人民和各人民民主国家的人民，在精神上以及行动上一直是团结一致的，但是由于帝国主义及其所雇佣的国民党匪帮的阻挠，我们和各国长时期中未能建立外交关系。现在情形完全不同了，中国人民已经完全扫清了我国与各国进一步加强友谊与合作的障碍。在中国人民政协开会期间和中央人民政府成立之后，我们不断接到各国友人充满热情的贺电，已使我们更感到我们不是孤立的；现在，从苏联开端，愿与我国建立外交关系的照会不断飞来，更证实了毛主席在人民政协会议开幕词中所说的：我们的朋友遍于全世界。
    保、罗、匈、朝、捷、波等国的照会中都说到了：中国人民的胜利就是世界拥护和平的力量的胜利，说到了我国和这些国家各民族伟大理想的共同性；这说明了这些国家首先与我国建立外交关系完全不是偶然的。这些外交关系一经建立，必然会日益巩固，成为中国与各国间发展经济、政治、文化关系的良好基础，成为保卫世界和平的巨大力量。
    正如我们一向所宣传的，我们欢迎苏联、各人民民主国家、各被压迫民族国家和我国建立邦交，同时也不拒绝其他任何国家在平等友好和互相尊重领土主权的原则上和我国建立外交关系。
    去年十一月二十一日，中共中央曾发表过一个声明，说明了我们保卫中国领土主权完整的严正立场，并宣告：“中国共产党、中国解放区人民民主政府及中国人民解放军愿与一切外国，包括美国在内，建立平等的友好的关系，并保护一切外国在华侨民包括美国侨民在内的正当利益；但是必须保持中国领土主权的完整，不受任何侵略。”今年四月三十日，中国人民解放军总部发言人李涛将军为英舰紫石英号事件发表的声明中也提到这一点，并宣称：“外国政府如果愿意考虑和我们建立外交关系，它就必须断绝和国民党残余力量的关系，并将它在中国的武装力量撤回去。”我们所反对的只是帝国主义制度及其反对中国人民的阴谋计划。而在平等、互利和互相尊重领土主权的原则上建立外交关系，则是我国人民与各国人民所一致欢迎的。我们很高兴地读到了英共政治委员会九月二十三日的声明和美共领袖本月三日给毛泽东主席的贺电，他们都谈到了他们国家的人民都在迫切要求各该国的现政府和新中国建立平等互利的外交关系与商业关系；英国商人们也纷纷对其政府作这样的要求。他们都认为这是缓和在他们国家发展中的经济危机给予他们本国人民大众的深重苦难的重要方法之一。美英等国的统治者，应该从世界的东方发生的伟大的变革中取得一些教训了。他们只要断绝对于国民党反动派的关系，对人民的新中国采取真正的而不是虚伪的友好态度，我们是愿意在平等、互利和互相尊重领土主权的原则基础上和他们谈判建立外交关系的问题的。
    中国人民已经站立起来了，不平等条约的时代已经终结了，中国人民欢迎一切真正以平等待我的国家和我国建立外交关系，欢迎真正友好平等邦交。
