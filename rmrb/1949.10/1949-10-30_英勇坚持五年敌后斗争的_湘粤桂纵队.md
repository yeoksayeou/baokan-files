The Hunan-Guangdong-Guangxi Column, Which Heroically Persisted in Guerrilla Warfare Behind Enemy Lines for Five Years
Zhang Ke, Lu Guiguo

In 1945, more than 1,000 farmers in Guangning County revolted. They quickly joined forces with more than 300 members of the Pearl River Column led by the Communist Party to form the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, which was the predecessor of today's Hunan-Guangdong-Guangxi Column.

Not long after this anti-Japanese armed force was formed, the Kuomintang bandit army concentrated its forces to "mop up," attempting to eliminate this people's armed force. First, the Kuomintang bandit gang used two battalions of regular troops in coordination with local reactionary armed forces to attack the guerrillas. Then, they dispatched an entire division of the 131st Division to encircle and suppress them, frantically implementing cruel methods such as "clearing the plains and surrounding the mountains," "blockhouse encirclement," "blocking the mountains to starve the mountains to death," and "merging villages, migrating people, and burning mountains." In the winter of 1948, they even carried out the "three-all" policy of burn all, kill all, loot all, and many villages were turned into scorched earth. The forests where the guerrillas had stayed were also burned down. More than 500 innocent people were killed in Guangning.

However, the people's armed forces cannot be eliminated. Under the enemy's brutal looting, burning and killing, more farmers successively joined the guerrillas and fought heroically against the enemy. The guerrillas laid landmine arrays everywhere on the main roads used by the enemy. Once, more than 20 enemies were killed on the Five Finger Mountain in Guangning County, so that the bandit army dared not cross the Lei Pool again. Sometimes, when the enemy's encirclement gradually narrowed, they disintegrated into smaller groups, divided into groups, and interspersed behind the enemy, and constantly attacked the enemy all the way to the plains, the banks of the Beijiang River, and the Yuehan Road. During those difficult years, the guerrillas received enthusiastic and desperate support from the people everywhere. Villagers often crossed the bandit army's blockade line at night to deliver grain to their sons and soldiers in the mountains. With the help of the people, the guerrillas often operated in areas ten miles from the outskirts of Qingyuan City. Merchants and residents in Qingyuan City also warmly welcomed them and secretly donated grain and money on their own initiative.

The commanders and fighters of the guerrillas fought against the enemy, overcoming all difficulties. There was often no food in the deep mountains and wilderness, so everyone ate wild vegetables and leaves to satisfy their hunger; when it was bitterly cold, everyone resisted by singing loudly. A guerrilla in the suburbs of Guangning City went out to work at night and hid in coffins in the cemetery during the day, which lasted for three months. Huang Mei, a female cultural instructor, charged into battle through the ice and snow with the soldiers in the Xueshan battle between Guangning and Huaiji. Due to the lack of medicines, the medical staff, Mai Ke, used traditional Chinese medicine instead of western medicine, and used steamed native cotton as medical cotton, and established training courses to train many health cadres. Although in an environment of extremely difficult material conditions and extremely high troop mobility, the guerrillas still insisted on publishing two mimeographed newspapers, "Current Affairs News" and "Soldier Culture," and a publication. Each regiment had a regimental newspaper, so that the commanders and fighters could still obtain cultural food in the arduous battles.

The difficult years ended with the arrival of the national victory. In May last year, this people's armed force began to attack, annihilating more than 200 enemies from a security brigade in Fuluokou, Guangning in one fell swoop. Last winter, near Guangning City, with two companies of troops, they fought 1,500 enemies for seven days, and finally defeated the enemy, killing and wounding more than 100 enemies. This year, the large army crossed the river to the south, and all the commanders and fighters actively cooperated in combat, and once liberated Guangning, Ruyuan, and Linwu County in southern Hunan. In August, they annihilated a machine gun and artillery company of the enemy in Guangning County, and seized a mortar and three heavy machine guns. When the People's Liberation Army entered Qingyuan County in northern Guangdong this time, they finally joined forces with the field army brother troops victoriously after stubbornly persisting in five years of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. In this shoulder-to-shoulder battle, they annihilated a company of the remnant bandit 23rd Army and seized two rocket launchers and seven American-style light machine guns. The people's armed forces in the Hunan-Guangdong-Guangxi border area, who had persisted in hard struggles in the deep mountains and wilderness for five years, have now equipped themselves with American weapons.

　　英勇坚持五年敌后斗争的
    湘粤桂纵队
    张克　陆桂国
    一九四五年，广宁县一千多农民起义了，他们很快就和共产党领导下的珠江纵队的三百多人会合，组成了抗日义勇队，这便是今天湘粤桂纵队的前身。
    这支抗日武装刚刚组成不久，国民党匪军便集中兵力扫荡，企图将这一支人民武装消灭掉。首先国民党匪帮用两个营的正规军配合地方反动武装向游击队进攻，接着又调一三一师一个整师前来围剿，疯狂地实行了所谓“肃清平原包围山地”、“碉堡包围”、“封锁山区困死山区”、“并村移民放火烧山”等等残酷办法。一九四八年冬更进行烧光、杀光、抢光的三光政策，许多村庄变成了焦土。游击队住过的树林也都被烧光。广宁人民无辜被杀的达五百多。
    但是，人民的武装是消灭不了的。在敌人惨酷的劫掠烧杀下，却有更多的农民陆续地参加了游击队，英勇地和敌人进行斗争。游击队员们在敌人来往的大道上到处布下地雷阵。有一次在广宁县五指山上就炸死了二十多个敌人，使匪军再也不敢越雷池一步。有的时候，当敌人包围圈逐渐缩小时，他们便化整为零，分成小组，穿插到敌人的后面去，一直活动到大平原上、北江岸边和粤汉路上，不断地打击敌人。在那些艰难的岁月中，游击队得到了各地人民热烈的、不顾一切的支援。老乡们常在黑夜越过匪军封锁线到山地给子弟兵送粮。依靠人民的协助，游击队员们常常活动到清远城郊十里的地区。清远城里的商民也热烈欢迎他们，偷偷地自动给捐送粮款。
    游击队的指战员们排除一切困难与敌人斗争着。在深山荒地里常常没有粮食，大家就吃野菜和树叶充饥；寒冷逼人的时候，大家就用高声唱歌来抵抗。在广宁城郊活动的一个游击队员，黑夜出去工作，白天就隐藏在坟墓中的棺材里，这样整整过了三个月。女文化教员黄媚，在广宁与怀集间的雪山战斗中，和战士们一样踏着冰雪冲锋陷阵。医务人员麦克因药品缺乏，用中药代替了西药，土棉蒸过后当药棉，并创办了训练班，练训出许多卫生干部。虽然是在物质条件极端困难和部队流动性极大的环境里，游击队还是坚持出版了“时局新闻”、“战士文化”两种油印报纸和一种刊物，每个团都有团报，使指战员们在艰苦的战斗中仍然可以获得文化的食粮。
    艰苦的岁月随着全国的胜利形势的到来而终结了。去年五月，这支人民武装开始出击，在广宁扶罗口一举歼灭了敌人一个保安大队二百余人，去年冬季又在广宁城附近以两个连的兵力，同一千五百个敌人战斗了七天，终于打垮了敌人，毙伤敌一百多名。今年大军渡江南下，全体指战员们更积极地配合作战，曾一度解放广宁、乳源及湘南的临武县城。八月又在广宁县歼敌一个机炮连，并缴获了一门迫击炮和三挺重机枪。在这次人民解放军大军进入粤北清远县时，他们终于在顽强地坚持了五年的敌后斗争后，胜利地和野战军兄弟部队会师，并在此肩作战中，消灭残匪二十三军一个连，缴获了两门火箭筒，七挺美式轻机枪。在深山荒野里坚持苦斗了五年的湘粤桂边区的人民武装，现在也用美械装备了自己。
