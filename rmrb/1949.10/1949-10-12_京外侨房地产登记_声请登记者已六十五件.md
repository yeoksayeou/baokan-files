Registration of Foreign Real Estate Outside of Beijing
	65 Applications Received

[This City News] Since the Beijing Municipal People's Government began handling the registration of foreign real estate in the city on September 15th, the number of foreigners going to the Land Administration Bureau to apply for registration has been increasing daily. As of October 7th, the bureau had issued 159 blank registration application forms, and a total of 65 applications had been submitted. These included 8 from American citizens, 12 from British citizens, 5 from French citizens, 1 from Italian citizens, 2 from Belgian citizens, 1 from Indian citizens, 1 from Korean residents, and 35 from churches. With the exception of the owner of the Xishiku Catholic Church in the city, who has not yet submitted the title deeds because they are not readily available, most foreigners have already handed over their property deeds to the Land Administration Bureau for safekeeping. After foreign private real estate is applied for registration, the Land Administration Bureau will send personnel to the districts to survey and measure the properties.
