Programmatic Document of Communism
By Miting, Translated by Guo Lijun, Proofread by Cao Baohua

One hundred years have passed since the publication of the "Communist Manifesto," created by the great teachers of the proletariat, Marx and Engels (Editor's note: The first edition of the "Communist Manifesto" was published in 1848). This work, the greatest creation of human thought, is the programmatic document of communism and a brilliant explanation and demonstration of the basic principles of scientific communism.

"This little book," Lenin wrote about the "Manifesto," "is worth many volumes: the entire organized and fighting proletariat of the civilized world lives and moves to this day in its spirit."

"The Song of Songs of Communism"—Comrade Stalin spoke of the "Communist Manifesto" in such moving words.

Marx and Engels demonstrated the world-historical role of the proletariat as the gravedigger of capitalism and the creator of socialist society. With scientific precision, they determined the inevitability of the bankruptcy of capitalism and the victory of communism.

The past century has been filled with the greatest battles in world history between contending classes, filled with revolutions, interstate conflicts, and devastating wars; this century has fully and completely confirmed the correctness of the doctrines of Marx and Engels. Marxism has won a series of victories in this period, despite the frantic resistance of the bourgeoisie and its servants.

The greatest victory of the ideas of the "Communist Manifesto" is the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia. On one-sixth of the earth's surface, our glorious Bolshevik Party and the working class, led by the brilliant successors of Marx and Engels, Lenin and Stalin, have victoriously fulfilled their historical task of overthrowing capitalism and establishing a socialist society. The first socialist society in the world has embodied the great principles of scientific communism in life, and it has existed and developed for thirty years.

The omnipotent truth of Marxist doctrine has never shone so brightly as it does now, now that the Soviet socialist state has saved world civilization from the German fascist butchers, standing at the leading position of the democratic and anti-imperialist camp in the struggle for peace and democracy, now that the people's democratic countries that have broken away from the imperialist system are growing and becoming stronger, now that the communist parties of all countries are attracting more and more millions of fighters to their glorious fighting banner day by day against imperialism, for lasting peace, for democracy and socialism, for the equality, freedom, and fraternity of all nations.

　　　　※　　　　　　　※　　　　　　　※　　　　　　　※

The "Communist Manifesto" was created in a period when the capitalist system had gained a dominant position in most European countries, and the working class had stepped onto the stage of broad political struggle. The workers' movement was gradually acquiring a more organized and political nature at that time.

In the 1930s and 1940s, the mass movement of the British working class—the Chartist movement—rose to a high level. In the early 1930s of the same century, the famous uprising of the Lyon textile workers in France took place under the slogan "Live working or die fighting!" In the 1940s, the Silesian textile workers in Germany held an uprising.

A new class in society—the proletariat—stepped onto the stage of history. But it still lacked an understanding of its historical role, a scientific understanding of its tasks, and the forms and methods of struggle for its own liberation. Marx and Engels armed the working class with all of this. The great goal that Marx and Engels pointed out to the working class—to overthrow capitalism and create a communist society—was not the result of utopian ideas, but arose from a scientific analysis of the laws of social development. Marx and Engels transformed socialism from utopia into science. They mastered all the intellectual wealth of the time and critically transformed it, creating the theory of scientific communism. The "Communist Manifesto" is precisely the fully mature work of Marxism.

"In this work," Lenin wrote, "a new worldview is outlined with brilliant clarity and vividness, an overview of thorough materialism including the field of social life, an overview of dialectics as the most comprehensive and profound doctrine about development, and an overview of the theory of class struggle and the world-historical revolutionary role of the creator of the new communist society—the proletariat."

The emergence of Marxism was a true revolution in the development of social science, philosophy, political economy, and history. The materialist conception of history is a great victory of scientific thought. It laid a solid foundation for the view of the laws of social life. The idealist views that had dominated historical views before Marx and Engels were devastatingly attacked. The proletariat obtained a powerful weapon—the materialist conception of history. This theory explained the causes of social phenomena, the laws of social development, and the role and significance of class struggle in society. Based on this theory, Marx and Engels demonstrated the great historical task of the proletariat.

Comrade Stalin demonstrated the theoretical basis of the "Communist Manifesto" in his classic work "Anarchism or Socialism?" Starting from Marx's doctrine, from the point that the development of social life is due to changes in productive forces, Comrade Stalin pointed out: just as the bourgeois system closely followed the landlord-serf system, the socialist system closely followed the capitalist system, because this is the inevitable law of the development of social productive forces.

Comrade Stalin further demonstrated the tactical basis of the "Communist Manifesto":

"The tactical basis of scientific socialism is the doctrine of irreconcilable class struggle, because this is the best weapon in the hands of the proletariat. The proletariat's class struggle is the weapon by which the proletariat seizes power and subsequently expropriates the bourgeoisie to establish socialism."

Marx and Engels pointed out to the working class the correct path to escape capitalist wage slavery. Marx and Engels armed the laborers who were fighting for their social liberation spiritually with their newly created philosophical worldview—dialectical materialism.

Marx and Engels were giants of revolutionary theory and revolutionary practice. Comrade Stalin said: They were active leaders of the active proletarian movement. They led the first international workers' organization—the "Communist League." The formal program of this alliance was the "Communist Manifesto."

The Second Congress of the "Communist League" (November 1847), in accordance with the proposal of Marx and Engels, issued a great call: "Workers of all countries, unite!" Since then, this slogan has become the fighting slogan of the international proletarian struggle.

It was at this congress that Marx and Engels were entrusted with drafting the league's program—the "Communist Manifesto." This immortal creation of scientific communism, permeated with an irrepressible revolutionary spirit and iron logic, is a model of party spirit in science and a great example of theory serving the cause of liberation of laborers.

The "Communist Manifesto" is permeated with ideological irreconcilability and ruthlessness towards the enemies of the proletariat, intolerance towards any petty-bourgeois wavering and utopian illusions, and a deep-seated hatred of the capitalist oppression system.

　　　　※　　　　　　※　　　　　　※　　　　　　※

The "Communist Manifesto" provides a scientific picture of the development of bourgeois relations of production with unsurpassed power, exposing the irreconcilable contradictions of capitalist society and the historical temporality of the capitalist system. The bourgeoisie, after shattering the feudal fetters that bound the development of productive forces, gave the productive forces a new and powerful impetus. However, after establishing the conditions for the great development of productive forces, the bourgeoisie later became unable to adapt to the forces it had created. The bourgeois relations of production became an obstacle to the development of productive forces. An insurmountable contradiction is taking place and growing between the productive forces and the relations of production in bourgeois society. Along with the development of capitalism, the proletariat is also growing. The position of the working class in bourgeois society makes it the only thoroughly revolutionary force, a revolutionary force capable of accomplishing the great task of destroying the capitalist mode of production and establishing a new advanced social system—communism.

"The proletariat," the "Communist Manifesto" states, "the lowest stratum of present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air."

The pages of the "Communist Manifesto" that deeply, compactly, and vividly describe the various antagonistic contradictions inherent in bourgeois society belong to the most outstanding pages of world literature. The "Manifesto" uses fiery words to denounce the plagues of the bourgeois system and relentlessly exposes the hypocritical words about freedom and equality under bourgeois rule. Marx and Engels condemn this bourgeois society based on the exploitation of the vast majority by a tiny minority.

The bourgeoisie, they wrote, "has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous 'cash payment.' It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom—Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation."

How appropriate and powerful these angry words are when applied to the modern imperialist world! In all capitalist countries, especially in the United States, which is the main fortress of capitalism, making money and doing business are the real gods. Everything—human conscience, honor, personal strengths, family relationships, scientific creations—has become business. Everything is measured by the "almighty dollar."

The "Communist Manifesto" clearly describes the characteristics of state power in capitalist society: "The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie." Marx and Engels wrote this way a hundred years ago. Production has fully and completely confirmed their assessment. The modern bourgeois state is increasingly organically combined with capitalist monopolies, and the rule of financial oligarchs and stockbrokers is becoming increasingly blatant.

The idea of violently overthrowing the bourgeoisie and the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat run like a red thread through the entire "Communist Manifesto," although the term "dictatorship of the proletariat" was used by Marx later. Marx and Engels taught in the "Manifesto" that the proletariat should become the ruling class and use its political rule to seize the means of production and means of production from the bourgeoisie and establish a new communist society.

Various opportunists and reformists have tried everything possible to castrate this revolutionary essence of Marx and Engels' doctrine, and they have especially betrayed the principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat—the main thing in Marxism. They have obliterated this most important principle of Marxism, refused to wage a revolutionary struggle against capitalism, and spread reformist illusions about the "peaceful growth" of capitalism into socialism among the masses. Today's right-wing socialists, as the main social pillar of the imperialist bourgeoisie, have gone even further than their predecessors in trying to save collapsing capitalism at any cost.

Lenin and Stalin defended the great ideas of Marx and Engels in the irreconcilable struggle against various types of opportunism, and theoretically developed this idea under the conditions of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution.

Marx and Engels pointed out in the "Communist Manifesto" that the leading force of the proletariat in its revolutionary struggle is the communists. The strength of the communists lies in the fact that they most fully and correctly represent the vital interests of the proletariat. Their strength lies in the fact that they are the most militant and resolute team of the working class, and that "in theory, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement."

Lenin and Stalin developed Marx and Engels' brilliant original work on the party based on the new conditions of the proletarian class struggle. They created a complete doctrine about the party, that the party is the highest form of the proletarian class organization, and is the basic weapon in the hands of the proletariat to fight for political power. Without the party as a leading and guiding force, it is impossible to complete the socialist revolution, establish a socialist society, and advance to communism.

　　　　※　　　　　　※　　　　　　※　　　　　　※

The great ideas of the "Communist Manifesto," initially possessed by a relatively small vanguard of scientific communism, increasingly grasped millions of the masses with the growth of the international workers' movement, and became a powerful material force for transforming the world. The history of the "Communist Manifesto" is the history of the irresistible development of the proletarian movement around the world, and the history of the brilliant victory of Marxism.

Lenin pointed out in his famous essay "The Historical Destiny of the Doctrine of Marx," written in 1913, the three main periods of world historical development after the creation of the "Communist Manifesto." The first period was from the revolution of 1848 to the "Paris Commune," when the heroic Paris workers made the first attempt to seize power (1871); secondly, the second period was from the "Paris Commune" to the first Russian revolution; finally, the third period began with the Russian revolution of 1905.

At the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries, a new era in history began. Capitalism entered the highest and final stage of its development. Capitalism became parasitic, decadent, and moribund capitalism. All the contradictions inherent in bourgeois society became extremely acute. Imperialism itself brought about comprehensive reaction, the masses of the people were oppressed to the extreme, the revolutionary anger of the proletariat in various bourgeois countries was growing, and the national liberation struggle in the colonies was unfolding.

It was in this period that the opportunism of social democracy gained its development and became the agent of the bourgeoisie in the workers' movement. The revisionist "doctrine" of "social peace" occurred; the proposition of abandoning the class struggle and the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat was announced; "corrupt philistinism" and "parliamentary coalition" replaced the revolutionary content of Marxism.

Lenin and Stalin, in the struggle against all forms and all kinds of opportunism, not only defended and restored the revolutionary content of Marxism, whether in Russia or on the international stage, but also further developed Marxism, enriching Marxism with new conclusions and new principles suitable to the new conditions of the proletarian class struggle in the era of imperialism. Leninism is the Marxism of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution. The new era of the development of Marxist theory is linked to the names of Lenin and Stalin, and the world-historical victory of Marxism is inseparable from their names.

Leninism arose and grew in the most ruthless struggle against all forms and all kinds of opportunism. The Bolshevik Party, a new type of party, established by Lenin and Stalin, thoroughly crushed the opportunists and drove them out of its ranks. It therefore gained remarkable internal integrity and strength, and gained the true revolutionary unity of its ranks. The Bolshevik Party steadfastly defended the ideological purity of Marxist-Leninist theory. This is the decisive factor in its world-historical victory.

As early as 1894, when creating and developing Marxism from the ideas of the "Communist Manifesto," Lenin made a very powerful and profound characterization of the historical role of the Russian working class in his first major work "What are the 'Friends of the People' and How do they Fight the Social Democrats?"

"When the advanced representatives of the working class," Lenin wrote, "have assimilated the ideas of scientific socialism, the idea of the historical role of the Russian worker, when these ideas have become widespread and a stable organization has been established among the workers to transform the present scattered economic war of the workers into a conscious class struggle—then the Russian worker, having rallied all the democratic elements around himself, will overthrow the autocracy and lead the Russian proletariat (together with the proletariat of all countries) along the straight road of open political struggle to the victorious communist revolution."

Lenin's genius thus portrayed the path of development of our country's working class fifty-four years ago. This remark by Lenin is an outstanding example of scientific foresight. The entire development of our country's worker movement has gone exactly as Lenin predicted. In alliance with the peasants, the working class overthrew the autocratic regime and followed the straight path to the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

In developing Marx's view of the leadership of the proletariat, Lenin created a complete theory of socialist revolution on the basis of the alliance of the proletariat and the semi-proletarian elements in urban and rural areas. Lenin comprehensively demonstrated the idea of the transformation of the bourgeois democratic revolution into the socialist revolution.

Lenin provided a brilliant analysis of the laws of the era of imperialism, and discovered the law of uneven economic and political development of capitalist countries in the era of imperialism. He pointed out that as a result of this unevenness, the conflicts between imperialist robbers for colonies, for markets, for sources of raw materials, and for capital export areas become acute, and cruel imperialist wars occur, and imperialist wars further weaken the strength of imperialism. Starting from the law of uneven development in the era of imperialism, Lenin made the greatest discovery of our time, creatively enriching Marxism with the new theory of socialist revolution, with the doctrine that socialism can be victorious first in several countries or even in a single country, and that socialism cannot be victorious in all countries simultaneously.

This discovery of Lenin armed the Bolshevik Party with a new and powerful ideological weapon, which further mobilized its revolutionary initiative, its activism, and its struggle for the victory of the socialist revolution and for the victory of socialism in our country.

In the brilliant work "State and Revolution," Lenin restored Marx and Engels' correct doctrine about the state. Based on the experience of the Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917, he further developed the Marxist theory of the state and the dictatorship of the proletariat in this and other works. Lenin pointed out that the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be democracy for everyone. The dictatorship of the proletariat should be "a democracy of a new type (for the proletarians and the poor in general) and a dictatorship of a new type (against the bourgeoisie)." Lenin discovered that Soviet power is the state form of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Lenin instructed that the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot arise as a result of the peaceful development of bourgeois society—it can only arise as a result of the violent revolution of the proletariat, and it must presuppose the breaking of the bourgeois state machine. He stipulated the tasks of the working class in establishing its own state institutions, and demonstrated the basic characteristics of the two stages of development of communist society.

Lenin had intended to write the second part of "State and Revolution," in which he planned to make a major summary of the experience of the Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917. Lenin intended to study and further develop the theory of the state based on the experience of the existence of Soviet power in our country, but death prevented him from realizing this work. But what Lenin did not have time to do, Comrade Stalin did.

Comrade Stalin, based on the great experience of the existence of the Soviet socialist state in the context of capitalist encirclement, created a complete and perfect doctrine about the socialist state. Stalin made a very clear analysis of the various stages of development of the socialist state, of the changes in its various functions in connection with changes in the situation, summarized the entire experience of Soviet state construction, and reached the conclusion that if the capitalist encirclement continues to exist, the state must be maintained even in the communist era.

The victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, the great superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, and the increasingly acute general crisis of capitalism—all these vividly confirm the victory of the idea of the "Communist Manifesto" that the capitalist mode of production must perish and communism must inevitably win.

The great program of social reform formulated by Marx and Engels in the "Communist Manifesto" for the proletariat, which became the ruling class, has been fully realized and greatly exceeded in the Soviet Union.

In the precise articles of the "Stalin Constitution," we see the embodiment of the brilliant ideas of the "Communist Manifesto." The only path of development of revolutionary Marxism is from the works of Marx and Engels to the works of Lenin and Stalin, the creators of the Bolshevik Party and the founders of the Soviet state.

　　　　※　　　　　　※　　　　　　※　　　　　　※

All the reactionary forces of the bourgeois world, the Roman Pope and Franco, the imperialist bandits and new war instigators Churchill and De Gaulle, the British fascists and South African racists, headed by the aspirants to modern world hegemony—American imperialism, have united to persecute communism. Right-wing socialists—Attlee and Bevin, Renner and Schumacher, Blum and Saragat—are the main pillars and agents of the imperialist reactionary forces.

Socialist opportunists seek to prolong the existence of capitalism, embellish it in various ways, build various ideological pillars for it, and attempt to corrode the consciousness of the working class. Kautsky's "ultra-imperialism," Hilferding's "organized capitalism," MacDonald's "constructive socialism," and the "democratic socialism" recently promoted by Attlee and Bevin—all these various "theories" of the traitors of the working class have had one task and one purpose in the past and present: to support the slave system of wage capitalism, to keep imperialism from being hit, and to ideologically corrupt the working class. But nothing will help them, and nothing will prevent the victorious advance of communism.

A hundred years ago, scientific communism had only just embarked on the great road. Today, communism is a vast and irresistible force. Under its banner, hundreds of millions of people around the world are fighting imperialism.

The powerful Soviet Union stands like an indestructible fortress. It has built socialism and is bravely advancing along the road of further development of productive forces, along the road to communism. The Soviet Union leads the anti-imperialist and democratic camp and is the guarantee of all the forces of socialism and democracy around the world.

The People's Democratic countries stand side by side with the Soviet Union, and they have broken away from the imperialist system. Using the great experience of the struggle of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, these countries are advancing towards socialism along their own paths.

An important proof of the growth of socialism and democracy is the tremendous increase in the prestige of the communist parties of various countries among the broadest working masses around the world. The communists lead the masses of the people to fight for national freedom and independence, for the elimination of social and national oppression, and expose the anti-people policies of the right-wing socialist ministers, who sell their country's national sovereignty to American imperialists. The people's confidence in the communists is constantly growing. The Communist Party has become a mass and combat party with millions of members in some European countries.

The rear of imperialism is also being hit. The national liberation movement in colonies and dependencies is developing more and more powerfully. Increasingly broad masses of people in colonies and dependencies are entering the struggle against imperialist colonialists.

While the strength of the democratic and anti-imperialist camp is growing and becoming stronger, the strength of the imperialist camp is weakening day by day. The general crisis of capitalism is becoming more acute, the capitalist world is increasingly divided by internal contradictions, and the real threat of a growing economic crisis looms over it. Imperialists are seeking a way out in preparing for a new war. But there is a great distance between the desire to launch a war and the realization of this desire. The united forces of socialism and democracy surpass the reactionary forces of imperialism. The capitalist century has come to an end. Capitalism is inevitably moving towards its own demise, as Marx and Engels had long ago brilliantly predicted in the "Communist Manifesto."

The present century is such a century that all roads lead to communism.

　　共产主义的纲领性的文件
    米丁  作  郭力军  译  曹葆华  校
    无产阶级底伟大导师马克思与恩格斯所创作的“共产党宣言”出版已经一百年了（编者按：“共产党宣言”初版出版于一八四八年）。这个属于人类思想底最伟大的创造的著作，是共产主义的纲领性的文件，并且是科学共产主义基本原则之天才的说明与论证。
    “这本小册子，—列宁关于‘宣言’写道，—抵得上许多卷册：文明世界底整个有组织的与战斗的无产阶级至今都按照它的精神生活着和运动着。”
    “共产主义的歌之歌”—斯大林同志用这样动人的字句讲到“共产党宣言”。
    马克思与恩格斯论证了作为资本主义底掘墓人与社会主义社会底创造者的无产阶级之具有世界历史意义的作用。他们以科学的精确性断定了资本主义底破产与共产主义的胜利之不可避免。
    过去的一百年，充满了互相斗争的阶级在世界历史上极伟大的战斗，充满了革命，充满了国家间的冲突，充满了毁灭性的战争；这一百年已经充分地和完整地证实了马克思与恩格斯底学说之正确性。马克思主义在过去这个时期已经赢得了一连串的胜利，虽然资产阶级及其仆役们进行了疯狂的抵抗。
    “共产党宣言”底思想之极伟大的胜利，是伟大十月社会主义革命底胜利与俄国无产阶级专政底建立。在世界六分之一的地面上，我们光荣的布尔什维克党与马克思和恩格斯事业底天才继承者——列宁和斯大林所领导的工人阶级，已经胜利地实现了自己推翻资本主义与建立社会主义社会的历史任务。世界上第一个社会主义社会已经把科学共产主义的伟大原则体现在生活中间，它存在与发展已经有三十年了。
    马克思主义学说底全能的真理从来没有象现在这样地光辉灿烂，现在苏维埃社会主义国家从德国法西斯屠夫们手里挽救了世界文明，站在为和平与民主而斗争的民主与反帝国主义的阵营底领导岗位上，现在各个摆脱了帝国主义体系的人民民主国家正在成长和强大，现在各国共产党一天比一天更多地把成百万的战士吸引到自己光荣的战斗的旗帜下来反对帝国主义，争取持久和平，争取民主与社会主义，争取各民族底平等、自由与友爱。
    　　　　※　　　　　　　※　　　　　　　※　　　　　　　※
    “共产党宣言”是在资本主义制度已经在欧洲大多数国家取得了支配地位以及工人阶级走上了广泛政治斗争舞台的时期中创作的。工人底发动当时逐渐地获得了一种更有组织的、政治的性质。
    在上世纪三十年代到四十年代，英国的工人阶级群众运动—宪章运动—提高到了一个高的水平。同一世纪三十年代之初，在法国发生了里昂纺织工人在“作工不能生活，毋宁战斗而死！”的口号下的有名的起义。在四十年代，德国西里西里的纺织工人举行了起义。
    现在社会底一个新的阶级—无产阶级—走上了历史的舞台。但是它仍缺乏对自己历史作用的认识，缺乏对任务的科学了解，缺乏为自己解放而斗争的形式和方法。马克思与恩格斯以这一切武装了工人阶级。马克思与恩格斯给工人阶级指示的伟大目标—推翻资本主义与创立共产主义社会—不是乌托邦思想底结果，而是从对社会发展规律的科学分析中产生的。马克思与恩格斯把社会主义从空想变成了科学。他们掌握了当代底全部知识财富并批判地加以改造，创造了科学共产主义底理论。“共产党宣言”正是马克思主义底充分成熟的著作。
    “在这一著作里，——列宁写道，——以天才的透澈性和鲜明性概述了新的世界观，概述了连社会生活领域也包括在内的彻底的唯物论，概述了作为关于发展的最全面和深刻的学说的辩证法，概述了关于阶级斗争与新的共产主义社会底创造者——无产阶级之具有世界历史意义的革命作用的理论。”
    马克思主义底产生是社会科学发展上、哲学上、政治经济学上、历史学上的真正的革命。唯物史观是科学思想底伟大的胜利。它给社会生活规律观打下了坚固的基础。在马克思与恩格斯以前在历史观方面占统治地位的唯心论见解，曾经受到了毁灭性的打击。无产阶级获得了一个强有力的武器—唯物史观。这个理论说明了社会现象底原因、社会发展底规律、社会中的阶级斗争底作用与意义。以这一理论为依据，马克思与恩格斯论证了无产阶级底伟大的历史任务。
    斯大林同志在其古典著作“无政府主义还是社会主义？”中展示了“共产党宣言”底理论基础。从马克思底学说出发，从社会生活底发展是由于生产力底变化这个论点出发，斯大林同志指出道：象资产阶级制度紧跟着地主农奴制度一样，社会主义制度紧跟着资本主义制度，因为这是社会生产力发展底必然的规律。
    斯大林同志更进一步展示“共产党宣言”底策略基础：
    “科学社会主义底策略基础，是关于不可调和的阶级斗争的学说，因为这是无产阶级手中最好的武器。无产阶级阶级斗争是无产阶级借以夺取政权及随后剥夺资产阶级以建立社会主义的武器。”
    马克思与恩格斯给工人阶级指出了摆脱资本主义雇佣奴役的正确道路。马克思与恩格斯以自己所创立的新的哲学世界观—辩证唯物论—在精神上武装了为自己社会解放而斗争的劳动者。
    马克思与恩格斯是革命理论与革命实践底巨人。斯大林同志说道：他们是活跃的无产阶级运动底活跃的领袖。他们领导了第一个工人国际组织——“共产主义者同盟”。这个同盟底正式纲领就是“共产党宣言”。
    “共产主义者同盟”第二次代表大会（一八四七年十一月）依照马克思与恩格斯底提议，发出了一个伟大的号召：“全世界无产者，联合起来！”这个号召从那时起就成了国际无产阶级斗争底战斗的口号。
    就在这个代表大会上，马克思与恩格斯被委托起草同盟底纲领——“共产党宣言”。科学共产主义的这个不朽的创作，渗透着不可抑制的革命精神与铁的逻辑，是科学中的党性底模范、理论之为劳动者解放事业服务的伟大范例。
    “共产党宣言”浸透着思想上对无产阶级底敌人的不可调和与严酷无情，对任何小资产阶级动摇与乌托邦幻想的毫不宽容，对资本主义压迫制度的刻骨仇恨。
    　　　　※　　　　　　※　　　　　　※　　　　　　※
    “共产党宣言”以不可超越的力量提供了一幅资产阶级生产关系发展的科学的图画，暴露了资本主义社会底不可调和的矛盾、资本主义制度底历史的暂时性。资产阶级，粉碎了那束缚生产力发展的封建主义羁绊之后，给了生产力以新的强有力的推动。然而，建立了生产力巨大发展的条件以后，资产阶级后来便不能适应于它自己所产生出来的力量。资产阶级的生产关系变成了生产力发展底阻碍。资产阶级社会底生产力与生产关系之间发生着与成长着不可克服的矛盾。与资本主义底发展一起，无产阶级也成长着。工人阶级在资产阶级社会中的地位使它成为唯一彻底的革命力量，这个革命力量能够完成摧毁资本主义生产方式与建立新的先进的社会制度——共产主义——这一伟大的事业。
    “无产阶级，——‘共产党宣言’里说道，——现代社会底最低阶层，如果不把压在它身上的构成正式社会的各个阶层底全部上层建筑抛出九霄云外，那末它就不能抬起头来，不能伸起腰来。”
    “共产党宣言”底深刻地、紧凑地与鲜明地描述资产阶级社会所固有的各个对抗的矛盾的篇页，是属于世界文献底最特出的篇页。“宣言”以火热的字句痛诋资产阶级制度底瘟疫，无情地揭发那些关于在资产阶级统治情况下的自由与平等的虚伪的词句。马克思与恩格斯痛责这个以极少数人对极大多数人的剥削为基础的资产阶级社会。
    资产阶级，——他们写道，——“使人与人之间除了赤裸裸的利害关系与冷酷的‘现金交易’之外，再没有别的什么联系。它把个人特长变成了交换价值，它用一种无良心的贸易自由去代替了无数特许的和取得的自由。一句话，它用公开的、无耻的、直接的、露骨的剥削去代替了用宗教与政治的幻想掩盖着的剥削。”
    这些愤怒的词句应用到现代帝国主义世界时是多么适切与多么有力呵！在各个资本主义国家，特别在作为资本主义底主要堡垒的美国，赚钱，做生意，是真正的上帝。一切东西——人底良心、荣誉、个人特长、家庭关系、科学创造——都变成了生意。一切东西都是用“万能的金元”来衡量的。
    “共产党宣言”明白地描述了资本主义社会中国国家权力底特征：“现代国家权力不过是管理整个资产阶级底共同事务的委员会而已”。马克思与恩格斯在一百年以前就这样写道。生产已经完全和充分地证实了他们的这个评价。现代资产阶级国家日益与资本主义独占有机地结合起来，财政寡头与证券经纪人底统治变得日益明目张胆。
    以暴力推翻资产阶级的思想，无产阶级专政的思想，象一条红线贯串着整个“共产党宣言”，虽然无产阶级专政这个名词是马克思稍后才使用的。马克思与恩格斯在“宣言”中教导道：无产阶级应当变成统治阶级，并利用其政治上的统治从资产阶级手中夺取生产工具与生产资料，建立新的共产主义社会。
    各种各样的机会主义者与改良主义者用一切方法试图阉割马克思与恩格斯学说底这个革命的本质，他们特别背叛了无产阶级专政这个原理—马克思主义底主要东西。他们抹煞了马克思主义底这个最重要的原理，拒绝与资本主义作革命的斗争，在群众中间散播关于资本主义“和平成长”为社会主义的改良主义幻想。今天的右派社会主义者们，作为帝国主义资产阶级底主要社会支柱，在不惜任何代价力图挽救正在崩溃的资本主义当中已经比他们的先驱者更进一步了。
    列宁与斯大林在与各种类型的机会主义作不可调和的斗争中保卫了马克思与恩格斯底伟大思想，在帝国主义与无产阶级革命时代底条件下从理论上发展了这个思想。
    马克思与恩格斯在“共产党宣言”中指出道：无产阶级在其革命斗争中的领导力量是共产党人。共产党人底力量就在于他们最充分和正确地表现着无产阶级底生命攸关的利益。他们的力量就在于他们是工人阶级底最有战斗性与最坚决的队伍，而在“理论方面他们在了解无产阶级运动底条件、进程与一般结果上则胜过无产阶级底其余群众。”
    列宁与斯大林依据无产阶级阶级斗争底新条件发展了马克思与恩格斯底论党的天才原作。他们创立了关于党的完整学说，即党是无产阶级阶级组织底最高形式，是无产阶级手中的争取政权的基本武器。没有作为领导与指导力量的党，就不可能完成社会主义革命，建立社会主义社会与前进到共产主义。

    “共产党宣言”底伟大思想，最初为科学共产主义的比较少数的先锋队所占有，随着国际工人运动底增长而日益掌握了成百万的群众，并变成了改造世界的强大的物质力量。“共产党宣言”底历史是全世界无产阶级运动底不可抗拒的发展底历史，是马克思主义底辉煌的胜利底历史。
    列宁在其写于一九一三年的著名的论文“马克思学说底历史命运”中指出了“共产党宣言”创作以后世界历史发展底三个主要时期。第一个时期是从一八四八年的革命到“巴黎公社”，当时英勇的巴黎工人作了第一个夺取政权的尝试（一八七一年）；其次，第二个时期是从“巴黎公社”到俄国第一次革命；最后，第三个时期是从一九○五年俄国革命开始。
    在十九世纪末与二十世纪初，开始了历史上一个新的时代。资本主义进入了自己发展底最高与最后的阶段。资本主义变成了寄生的、腐朽的、垂死的资本主义。资产阶级社会所固有的一切矛盾变得极度尖锐。帝国主义本身带来了全面的反动，人民群众被压迫到了极点，各个资产阶级国家的无产阶级底革命的愤怒正在增长，各个殖民地的民族解放斗争正在展开。
    就在这个时期，社会民主党的机会主义获得了自己的发展，成为了资产阶级在工人运动中的代理人。修正主义的关于“社会和平”的“学说”发生了；放弃阶级斗争与无产阶级专政理论的主张宣布出来了；“腐败的市侩主义”与“国会的联合”代替了马克思主义底革命内容。
    列宁与斯大林在与机会主义的斗争中，无论在俄国国内以及在国际舞台上，不仅保卫了和恢复了马克思主义底革命内容，而且进一步发展了马克思主义，以适合于帝国主义时代无产阶级阶级斗争底新条件的新结论与新原理来丰富了马克思主义。列宁主义是帝国主义与无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义。马克思主义理论发展的新时代是与列宁和斯大林底名字联系着的，马克思主义底具有世界历史意义的胜利是与他们的名字分不开的。
    列宁主义是在与一切形式和一切种类的机会主义作最无情的斗争中产生和壮大的。列宁与斯大林所建立的布尔什维克党、新型的党，彻底地粉碎了机会主义者，把他们赶出了自己的行列。它因此获得了显著的内部完整与力量，获得了自己队伍底真正革命的统一。布尔什维克党坚定不移地保卫着马克思列宁主义理论底思想纯洁性。这是它的具有世界历史意义的胜利底决定因素。
    早在一八九四年，从“共产党宣言”底思想出发，创造地发展马克思主义的时候，列宁在其第一部巨著“什么是‘人民之友’以及他们如何反对社会民主派？”中对于俄国工人阶级底历史作用作了一个非常有力与深刻的特征描述。
    “当工人阶级先进代表，——列宁写道，——领会了科学社会主义底思想，领会了关于俄国工人底历史作用的思想时，当这些思想得到了广泛的传布而工人中间建立了巩固的组织来把工人现时零散的经济战争变为自觉的阶级斗争时，——那么俄国工人，既然统率了一切民主分子，就要推翻专制制度，并引导俄国无产阶级（与世界各国无产阶级一起）循着公开政治斗争底笔直道路走向胜利的共产主义革命。”
    列宁底天才在五十四年以前这样地描画了我国工人阶级发展底道路。列宁底这个言论是科学预见底卓越的范例。我国工人运动底整个发展经过恰好如列宁所预言的那样。在与农民的联盟中，工人阶级推翻了专制政体，并循着笔直道路走到了伟大十月社会主义革命底胜利。
    在发展马克思关于无产阶级底领导权的观点时，列宁在城乡无产阶级与半无产阶级分子联盟底基础上创造了社会主义革命的完整理论。列宁全面地论证了资产阶级民主革命之转变为社会主义革命的思想。
    列宁提供了对于帝国主义时代规律的天才分析，发现了帝国主义时代资本主义各国经济与政治发展不平衡的规律。他指出道：由于这个不平衡底结果，帝国主义强盗们之间为了殖民地、为了市场、为了原料来源、为了资本输出区域的冲突就尖锐化起来，发生残酷的帝国主义战争，而帝国主义战争又更加削弱帝国主义底力量。从帝国主义时代发展不平衡的规律出发，列宁作了一个我们时代最伟大的发现，以社会主义革命底新理论，以社会主义可能首先在几个国家或甚至单独一个国家内胜利以及社会主义不可能在一切国家内同时胜利的学说来创造性地丰富了马克思主义。
    列宁底这个发现以新的强有力的思想武器武装了布尔什维克党，这个思想武器更加发动了它的革命倡导性、它的积极性，发动了它之为社会主义革命胜利、为社会主义在我国的胜利而斗争。
    在天才的著作“国家与革命”中，列宁恢复了马克思与恩格斯底关于国家的正确学说。根据一九○五年与一九一七年俄国革命底经验，他在这个以及其他各个著作中进一步发展了关于国家与无产阶级专政的马克思主义理论。列宁指出道：无产阶级专政不能是对一切人的民主。无产阶级专政应当是“新式的民主（对于无产者和一般穷人）国家与新式的专政（对于资产阶级）国家”。列宁发现了苏维埃政权是无产阶级专政底国家形式。列宁指示道：无产阶级专政不能作为资产阶级社会和平发展底结果而产生—它只能作为无产阶级暴力革命底结果而产生，它一定以打破资产阶级国家机器为前提。他规定了工人阶级在建立自己国家机构中的任务，展示了共产主义社会两个发展阶段底基本特点。
    列宁曾经打算写“国家与革命”底第二部分，在这一部分里他计划把一九○五年与一九一七年俄国革命经验作一主要的总结。列宁心想根据苏维埃政权在我国存在的经验，研究和进一步发展国家底理论，死亡使他不能够实现这个工作。但是列宁没有来得及作的，斯大林同志作了。
    斯大林同志，根据苏维埃社会主义国家在资本主义包围情形下存在的巨大经验，创造了关于社会主义国家的完整的与完备的学说。斯大林对于社会主义国家底各个发展阶段，对于它之与形势变化相联系的各个职能底变化，作了十分明澈的分析，概括了苏维埃国家建设底全部经验，达到了如果资本主义的包围继续存在则在共产主义时期也必须保持国家的结论。
    社会主义在苏联的胜利，社会主义制度对资本主义制度的伟大优势，以及资本主义底日益尖锐化的总危机——这一切都鲜明地证实了“共产党宣言”底关于资本主义生产方式一定灭亡与共产主义必然胜利的思想底胜利。
    马克思与恩格斯在“共产党宣言”里为那变成了统治阶级的无产阶级所制定的伟大社会改革的纲领，在苏联已经充分地实现了与大大地超过了。
    在“斯大林宪法”底精密条文里，我们看到“共产党宣言”底天才思想之体现。革命马克思主义发展底唯一路线是从马克思与恩格斯底著作到布尔什维克党底创造者与苏维埃国家底建立者——列宁与斯大林底著作。

    资产阶级世界底一切反动势力，罗马教皇与佛朗哥，帝国主义匪徒与新战争煽动者邱吉尔和戴高乐之流，英国的法西斯党徒与南非的种族主义者，以现代世界霸权底觊觎者——美国帝国主义为首，已经联合起来迫害共产主义。右派社会主义者——艾德礼与贝文、仑纳与舒马赫、勃鲁姆与萨拉加特，都是帝国主义反动势力底主要支柱与代理人。
    社会主义机会主义者力求延长资本主义底存在，用各种方法把它渲染，为它建立各种思想支柱，企图腐蚀工人阶级底觉悟性。考茨基底“超帝国主义”，希法亭底“有组织的资本主义”，麦克唐纳底“建设性的社会主义”，艾德礼与贝文最近宣传的“民主社会主义”——工人阶级底叛徒们之这一切形形色色的“理论”，过去和现在都具有着一个任务，一个目的：支持雇佣资本主义的奴隶制度，使帝国主义不受打击，从思想上腐化工人阶级。但是什么也帮助不了他们，什么也阻止不了共产主义的胜利的前进。
    一百年以前，科学共产主义只刚刚走上伟大的道路，今天共产主义是广大的不可抵抗的力量，在它的旗帜下全世界千千万万的人正在与帝国主义作战。
    强大的苏联象一个不可摧毁的堡垒耸立着，它已经建设了社会主义并且沿着生产力进一步发展的道路，沿着到共产主义的道路勇敢地前进。苏联领导着反帝与民主的阵营，是全世界社会主义与民主主义一切力量底保障。
    各人民民主国家与苏联并立在一起，它们已经摆脱了帝国主义体系。利用苏联各民族斗争底巨大经验，这些国家正在循着自己的道路向社会主义前进。
    社会主义与民主主义壮大之重要的证据，是各国共产党底威信在全世界最广泛的劳动群众中间巨大的增长。共产党人领导人民大众为民族自由与独立、为消灭社会的与民族的压迫而斗争，揭露右派社会主义的部长先生们底反人民的政策，这些部长先生们把本国的国家主权出卖给美国帝国主义者。人民群众对共产党人的信心不断地增长着。共产党在欧洲一些国家变成了拥有几百万党员的群众性的战斗的党。
    帝国主义底后方也正遭受着打击。殖民地与附属国底民族解放运动正日益强有力地开展着。殖民地与附属国底日益广泛的人民群众正进入反对帝国主义殖民者的斗争。
    当民主与反帝国主义的阵营底力量正在生长与壮大的时候，帝国主义阵营底力量却在日益削弱着。资本主义底总危机变得更加尖锐，资本主义世界被内在的矛盾日益分裂着，正在增长的经济危机底真正威胁笼罩在它头上。帝国主义者在准备新的战争中寻找出路。但是从发动战争的愿望到这个愿望底实现之间有着很大的距离。社会主义与民主主义底联合力量超过帝国主义的反动力量。资本主义世纪走到了尽头。资本主义不可避免地趋向自己的灭亡，这是马克思与恩格斯在“共产党宣言”中早已天才地预告了的。
    现在的世纪是这样的一个世纪，一切道路都导引到共产主义。
