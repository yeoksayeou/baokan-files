　　(I) Bringing the Friendship of the Chinese People to the Soviet Union
    ——Seeing off Ambassador Wang Jiaxiang to the Soviet Union
    Wang Jiaxiang, the first ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the Soviet Union, left Beijing on the 20th to take office in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union. The people of Beijing saw Ambassador Wang off to the Soviet Union with the same excitement as they welcomed Soviet Ambassador Roshchin to Beijing ten days ago.

    This is the departure of the first diplomatic envoy of the Chinese people who can truly represent their will, and it is also to the Soviet Union, the first friendly country of New China. Since the emergence of the Soviet Union in the world, the Chinese people have regarded her as their best friend, and the actual actions of the Soviet government and people have always proved that they are good friends of the Chinese people. However, for more than 30 years in the past, the sincere friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people was obstructed by the Kuomintang reactionaries for a long time. At that time, the Soviet diplomatic envoys sent to China, with sincere friendship towards the Chinese people, had to deal with the Kuomintang reactionaries in extremely difficult circumstances, and most of the aid to the Chinese people had to go through many tortuous paths. At that time, the Chinese people had no diplomatic envoys of their own in the Soviet Union, and the Chinese people's friendship with the Soviet government and people had not been able to grow smoothly under the heavy pressure of the Kuomintang reactionaries. However, due to the strong and invincible power of the people, this friendship has finally stood bravely for more than 30 years, overturning the stone that was pressing on it, and shaking hands with Soviet friends on the sun-drenched eastern continent with laughter: On October 2nd, China and the Soviet Union officially established diplomatic relations. On the 10th, Ambassador Roshchin arrived in Beijing. On the 20th, the Chinese people saw off their ambassador for the first time. We fully trust Ambassador Wang and believe that he can successfully complete the glorious mission entrusted to him by the Central People's Government and the people to consolidate and develop Sino-Soviet friendly relations. Ambassador Wang studied in the Soviet Union and is familiar with the Soviet Union; after returning to China, he struggled hard with the people in Jiangxi during the land revolution period, and then in northern Shaanxi, the anti-Japanese base area, for a long time. He has now been honorably appointed as the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State Council of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, so we believe that he can most fully represent the will of the Chinese people. Ambassador Wang is leaving the country, and the Chinese government and people are entrusting him to bring to the Soviet Union their sincere friendship with the Soviet government and people, and their lofty respect for Marshal Stalin, the leader of the world peace and democracy camp!

　　（一）把中国人民的友情带到苏联去
    ——欢送王稼祥大使离京赴苏
    中华人民共和国第一任驻苏大使王稼祥已于二十日离开北京，到苏联首都莫斯科去就任了。北京人民欢送王大使出国赴苏，正如十天前欢迎苏联驻我国大使罗申抵京一样，怀着同样兴奋的心情。
    这是中国人民第一个真正能代表自己的意志的外交使节的出国，又是到新中国的第一个友邦苏联去。自从世界上出现了苏联，中国人民就把她当作自己最好的朋友，苏联政府和人民的实际行动更始终证明着他们是中国人民的好朋友。可是在过去三十多年中，中苏人民的真诚的友谊长时期被国民党反动派从中作梗；在那时，苏联派到中国的外交使节，带着至诚的对中国人民的友谊，却不得不在极为困难的环境中与国民党反动派相周旋，对中国人民的援助多半是要经过许多曲折的道路。在那时，中国人民则完全没有自己的外交使节在苏联，中国人民对苏联政府和人民的友谊，在国民党反动派大石头的重压下一直没有能够顺畅地生长起来。但是，由于人民力量的坚强而不可被战胜，三十多年来，这种友谊终于勇猛地挺立了起来，掀翻了压在自己身上的石头，欢笑着和苏联友人在阳光普照的东方大陆上握手了：十月二日，中苏开始正式建立邦交。十日，罗申大使抵达北京。二十日，中国人民第一次为自己的大使送行。我们完全信托王大使，相信他能很好地完成中央人民政府和人民给他的巩固发展中苏友好关系的光荣使命。王大使曾留学苏联，对苏联是熟悉的；回国后，在土地革命时期的江西，直到抗日根据地陕北，长时期和人民在一起艰苦斗争，现在并已荣任中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院外交部副部长，因之我们相信他能最充分地代表中国人民的意志。王大使出国了，中国政府和人民交给他带到苏联的，就是对苏联政府和人民的至诚的友谊，和对世界和平民主阵营的领导者斯大林大元帅的崇高的敬意！
