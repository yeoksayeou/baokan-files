Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 6th:

　　Comrade Fadeyev, head of the Soviet delegation of cultural, artistic, and scientific workers, delivered a speech at the inaugural meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. The full text of the speech is as follows:

　　Dear friends:

　　A warm, brotherly salute to the Chinese workers, peasants, and intellectuals – the rural teachers, the urban teachers, the doctors, the agronomists, the university professors, the students – the hope of the new society!

　　We Soviet people who have come to you have grown up from the ranks of the working people. We are ordinary people.

　　Our parents cultivated the land, worked in factories, taught the children of farmers, and fought heroically just like you.

　　It is my supreme pleasure to extend my heartfelt greetings to such people who come from the people and are dedicated to the people.

　　The great achievement of the Chinese workers and peasants lies in the fact that the educated people have become one with the masses.

　　China's victory, which has global historical significance, is not only a political victory but also a cultural victory. From now on, only the most vile and shameless people would dare to say that China is backward.

　　These people believe that the significance of culture is manifested in fountain pens, shiny electric refrigerators, and large restaurants; however, in reality, the greatest significance of culture in the world lies in respecting hard-working people, in educating everyone, and in respecting all nations, regardless of their skin color.

　　This respect for national cultures, for the wealth that each nation can contribute to the treasure trove of humanity, is the greatest concern for the fate of all mankind.

　　If a person is loyal to his nation, if he loves her, then his greatest happiness is to dedicate his whole heart to her and elevate her to the highest peak of human culture.

　　I am forty-eight years old this year. I have lived in the villages of the Far Eastern coast, and although your country and ours have vast territories, it is not so far from here.

　　I am the son of a village doctor, and I often thought that after receiving an education, I would pass it on to my comrades, who were unable to receive an education under the Tsarist system.

　　The Soviet regime not only helped me realize this aspiration but also developed my creative power. And my childhood comrades have now become educated people as well.

　　There have been some so-called educated people in China, even participants in the "May Fourth" cultural movement. But these few people I am talking about rarely had contact with the people. They were in the reactionary camp, seeking personal status, and thus revealed themselves as shameless people who only knew how to enjoy themselves. No one in China remembers their names anymore. We, who are middle-aged, are watching the development of Chinese culture with loving hearts. We still remember the Chinese "May Fourth" cultural movement, and we still remember the great struggle that Lu Xun and his students and friends waged for the progress and development of the people; but it is now difficult for us to recall the names of those who accidentally participated in the movement. But the name of the great Lu Xun has entered the pantheon of heroes who inspire the people of the world to move towards happiness and prosperity.

　　Those who call themselves the "highest expression of culture" are actually mouthpieces of the oppressors, and these people have been forgotten today. Because the so-called high culture of the imperialists is the culture of the oppressors, not culture at all. It does not have the most important symbol of human society – social conscience, human love.

　　The great Lu Xun, in his masterpiece describing the insignificant character Ah Q, showed his sincere love for this person and clearly understood his weaknesses and strengths; because of this work, Lu Xun was included in the pantheon of world humanistic literature.

　　Some Chinese poets believed that their role and status in human culture would be determined by how they imitated the deformed things of bourgeois European culture. They have been forgotten. They originally wanted to become famous, but they failed. But excellent writers such as Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, and Ding Ling have become the most famous writers in the world.

　　Our great teachers Lenin and Stalin taught us: No matter how successful you are, you must continue to learn, learn, and learn again.

　　World culture is so beautiful precisely because it absorbs all the best and noblest things that each nation, as a treasure for the masses, adds to the treasure house of world culture. The lackeys hired by the imperialists wanted to sell off the great culture of the Chinese people as worthless and "backward." But the victorious Chinese people, the inheritors of the great Chinese culture, are carrying forward all the excellent things of the old Chinese culture.

　　The outstanding Chinese revolutionary, the son of the Chinese people, and his leader, Mao Zedong, very correctly said that the Chinese people will enter the world family of highly cultured peoples. Because only the people – the masters and inheritors of their own history – can distinguish what is beneficial and what is harmful to them in the old culture.

　　Lenin and Stalin taught us: In any national culture, there are two cultures: one culture is a culture in parentheses, which is created for the entertainment of the ruling class; the other culture is the real culture of the people, which cannot exist unless it is approved by the people.

　　In the field of literature, the Chinese people inherited their great novel literature, which was not included in the classics in the past, but which Lu Xun wrote about so greatly in his famous book "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction." The Chinese people have developed many good things from the old literature and passed them on to all mankind. These many things are the creations of outstanding writers of the feudal society at that time, but they have been approved by the people.

　　Until now, we have translated relatively few works of Chinese classical writers; but even in these immature translations, we have read the beautiful works of Li Bai and Du Fu with surprise and admiration, especially the poems from the seventh to ninth centuries, which are relatively well-known in our country. We have translated Bai Juyi's poems several times, and our intellectuals mostly like long poems such as "The Old Man of Xinfeng with a Broken Arm," which expresses deep sympathy for Chinese farmers.

　　The soul of the people is felt in these poems. Many works by Chinese writers in the late nineteenth century were full of patriotism. Their language is relatively close to us.

　　Introducing these democratic and popular advantages of great Chinese poetry to one's own people and all the people of the world, this glorious opportunity has now been placed before Chinese writers. We know that it is very difficult to translate Chinese classical literature into Russian, but we, who love all literature, must use all our strength to introduce the great Chinese heritage to our people and all the people of the world.

　　We have already done some preliminary work in translating Chinese classical literary works. Although there are various difficulties in translation, we have recognized all the works that deserve our praise, such as Bai Juyi's poems, Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, and the typical works of Tao Yuanming and Su Dongpo. We have also published some anthologies of Chinese poetry from the seventh to ninth centuries. We assure you that we will definitely make more efforts in this regard in the future.

　　What particularly moves us is the development of China's new culture. When Lu Xun's early works were translated into Russian, I was very young. But because it was difficult to express the people's language in Lu Xun's works, the translation was very difficult. There are still not many people in our country who understand the Chinese language, but I can guarantee that there will definitely be more such talents in the near future.

　　I am a person who understands the structure of the Chinese language slightly. With the help of the Chinese poet Xiao San, I translated Mr. Lu Xun's works into Russian word by word. Friends, please do not think that we have damaged the works of this great Chinese writer because of so-called artistry. On the contrary, we have tried to find the most accurate expression in the Russian language that can express Lu Xun's genius.

　　Lu Xun spent precious time translating my young work "Destruction" into Chinese; I did this to answer this world writer. I dare to assure Chinese literary writers that we will use all our strength to translate the great works of Lu Xun, one of the world's humanitarians, into Russian more accurately.

　　We Soviet people love China's new literature very much. The progressive people in our country have read Mao Dun's works "Hesitation" and "Midnight" with great interest. As for his short stories and essays published in our magazines, our love is needless to say. No matter how difficult Guo Moruo's poems are to translate, we still translated his "Heroic Team." I can tell you that this excellent representative of Chinese art and outstanding social activist enjoys a great reputation among our intellectuals. Ding Ling's novel "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River" and Zhao Shuli's "Changes in Li Village" have greatly helped us understand the heroic struggle of the Chinese people. Although we have not translated many works by Chinese writers, we are still familiar with the individual works of forty-three writers. Comrades, I can make a promise to you that we will translate the best works you want to create into Russian.

　　Our country is a new country with thirty-two years of experience in cultural development. In our country, the cultural level of the broad masses has been improved, and they are lovingly absorbing everything excellent created by mankind in the past and by progressive people in the world today. Therefore, dear comrades, please believe that we will not only contribute all our best experiences to you with enthusiasm, but we will also carefully study all the experiences of China's thousands of years of development, especially what the Chinese people have contributed to the development of world culture. I am honored to pay tribute to the outstanding entrepreneurs among Chinese intellectuals, because there are many things that are similar in the character of the Chinese people and the Russian people. The days we stay here will be the happiest days and will remain in our hearts forever. We live with you on a vast land, and our people are very numerous. History has made our hearts broad and open.

　　We have ascended to the world stage as victors.

　　Long live the great, powerful, heroic, and hard-working Chinese people!

　　Long live the Chinese intellectuals who contribute their knowledge to the people!

　　Long live the friendship, mutual assistance, and mutual respect between the two great brotherly nations of China and the Soviet Union!

　　Long live Mao Zedong, the excellent son of the Chinese people and the leader of the Chinese people!

　　Long live Stalin, the friend and leader of the entire progressive humanity, our teacher!

### 中苏友好协会成立大会上　法捷耶夫演说词

　　中苏友好协会成立大会上
    法捷耶夫演说词
    【新华社北京六日电】苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团团长法捷耶夫在中苏友好协会总会成立大会上的演说词全文如下：亲爱的朋友们：
    向中国工农群众和知识分子——乡村教师、城市教师、医生、农学家、大学教授、学生——向新社会的希望致热烈的兄弟的敬礼！
    来到你们这里的我们苏维埃人，是从劳动人民队伍里生长出来的。我们是平凡的人。
    我们的父母种过地，做过工，教过农民的孩子们，和你们一样英勇地战斗过。
    我能向来自人民而又献身于人民的这样一些人们致亲爱的敬礼，这是我无上的快乐。
    中国工农巨大的成就，就在于受过教育的人们已同人民大众打成一片。
    具有全世界历史意义的中国的胜利，不仅是中国政治的胜利，而且是中国文化的胜利。从现在起，只有最卑鄙无耻的人们，才敢说中国是落后的。
    这些人认为文化的意义是表现在自来水笔、光滑的电气冰箱和大餐厅上面；然而实际上，世界上文化的最大的意义是在于尊敬勤劳的人们，是在于使大家受到教育，在于尊重一切民族，不管他们的皮肤是什么颜色。
    这种对民族文化的尊敬，对每一民族向人类宝藏所能贡献的那种财富的尊敬，是给全人类的命运寄予最大的关心。
    如果一个人忠实于自己的民族，如果他热爱她，那他最大的幸福，就是把他整个的心奉献给她，把她提高到全人类文化的最高峰。
    我今年四十八岁。我在远东沿海的乡村里住过，虽然你们和我们的祖国的领土都很大，可是这里离你们却不是那样远的。
    我是一个乡村医生的儿子，我常常想，在受到了教育之后，我要传给自己的同志们，那些人在沙皇制度的条件下，是不可能受到教育的。
    苏维埃政权不仅帮助我实现了这个志愿，而且发扬了我在创作中的力量。而且我的儿童时代的同志，现在也都成了有教养的人了。
    在中国曾有过一些所谓有教养的人们，他们甚至是“五四”文化运动的参加者。但是我所说的这些少数的人，很少跟人民有联系，他们在反动的营垒里，钻营个人的地位，因此暴露出是只知道自己享乐的无耻之徒。在中国已经没有人记得他们的姓名了。我们已经是中年的人了，怀着热爱的心情注视着中国文化的发展。我们还记得中国“五四”文化运动，还记得鲁迅同他的学生和朋友为人民进步和发展而进行的伟大的斗争；但我们现在很难再想起那些偶然参加运动的人们的名字了。而伟大的鲁迅的名字则已进入鼓舞世界人民走向幸福和繁荣的功臣阁。
    自命为“最高文化表现”的人们，实际上是压迫者的传声筒，这些人们在今天已经被遗忘掉了。因为帝国主义者的所谓高度文化是压迫者的文化，根本不是文化。它没有人类社会上最主要的标志——社会的良心，人类的爱。
    伟大的鲁迅，在他描写渺小人物阿Ｑ的杰作中，表现出他衷心地喜爱这个人，并清楚这个人的弱点和力量；因为这个作品，鲁迅就列入了全世界人道主义文学的功臣阁里了。
    有些中国的诗人认为：他们在人类文化中的作用与地位要看他们如何模仿资产阶级欧洲文化的畸形的东西来决定，他们已经被遗忘了。他们原来想要成名，而结果失败了。可是象郭沫若、茅盾、丁玲等优秀的作家，却成为全世界最出名的作家了。
    我们伟大的导师列宁和斯大林教导我们：无论你们得到怎样的成功，还要学习、学习、再学习。
    世界文化之所以如此优美，正是因为它吸取了每个民族作为大众的珍品而加入世界文化宝库中的一切最美好的和最高尚的东西。帝国主义雇佣的走狗们想要把中国人民伟大的文化当做毫无价值的“落后”的东西出卖掉。但是胜利了的中国人民，伟大的中国文化继承者，正在发扬中国旧文化的一切优秀的东西。
    杰出的中国革命家，中国人民的儿子和他的领导者毛泽东，很正确地讲过：中国人民将进入到高度文化的人民的世界大家庭。因为只有人民——自己历史的主人和继承者——才能够区别：在旧的文化中什么是对他有益的，什么是对他有害的。
    列宁和斯大林教导我们：在任何民族文化中都有两种文化：一种文化是带括弧的文化，它是为统治阶级消遣而创造的；另一种文化是真正的人民的文化，这个文化假如不被人民盖章批准，是不能存在的。
    在文学领域中，中国人民承继了自己伟大的小说文学，这个在过去是不列入经书子传之中的，而鲁迅在他有名的著作“中国小说史略”里却写得那样伟大。中国人民从旧文学中发展了许多好的东西，并把它们传给全人类，这许多的东西是当时封建社会优秀作家的创作，但是被人民所批准的。
    一直到现在，中国古典作家的作品中，我们译出的还相当的少；但是即使在这些不成熟的译品中，我们已惊奇而羡慕地读到了李白和杜甫的优美的作品，尤其是七世纪到九世纪的诗，在我们那里是比较出名的。我们曾几次译过白居易的诗，而且我们的知识分子大都喜欢的长诗，如“新丰折臂翁”等，在这里表现了对于中国农民深厚的同情。
    这些诗歌里感觉到人民的灵魂。有许多十九世纪末期的中国作家的作品，都充满着爱国主义的心情。他们的语言对我们是比较接近的。
    把伟大的中国诗歌里的这些民主的和人民的优点介绍给自己人民和全世界一切人民，这个光荣的机会现在已经摆在中国文学家的面前了。我们知道：把中国古典文学译成俄文是非常困难的，但是爱好一切文学的我们，一定要拿出我们一切的力量，把中国的伟大遗产介绍给我们的人民和全世界的一切人民。
    在翻译中国古典文学作品方面，我们已经做了一些初步的工作。虽然翻译有种种困难，但是我们已经认识到一切值得我们赞扬的作品，例如白居易的诗、聊斋志异，和陶渊明、苏东坡等典型的作品。我们也出版了一些七世纪至九世纪的中国诗歌选集。我们向你们保证：今后在这方面一定要更多地努力。
    尤其使我们感动的是中国新文化的发展。当鲁迅的初期作品译成俄文时，我还很年轻。但是由于难于表达鲁迅作品里的人民语言，翻译是非常困难的。现在我们国内懂中国语言的人还不太多，但是我可保证：在最近的将来，这样的人材一定要增多的。
    我是稍为懂得中国语言结构的人，在中国的诗人萧三帮助之下，把鲁迅先生的作品，一字一句的译成俄文。朋友们请不要认为：我们由于所谓艺术性的缘故，而把中国这位伟大的作家的作品弄坏了，相反，我们曾努力在俄国文字语言里寻找那种能够表达鲁迅天才的最正确的表现法。
    鲁迅曾费了珍贵的时间把我年轻时候的作品“毁灭”译成中文；我这样作就是为了回答这位世界的文学家的。我敢向中国文艺作家们保证：我们要用一切力量把世界人道主义者之一的鲁迅的伟大作品，更真切地译成俄文。
    我们苏联人民是很爱好中国的新文学的。我们国内前进的人们以极大的兴趣读过茅盾的作品：“动摇”和“子夜”，至于在我们杂志上所登载的他的短篇小说和论文，我们的喜爱更不必说了。不管郭沫若的诗歌是如何难译，但是我们仍然把他的“英雄队伍”译出来了。我可以告诉你们：这位中国艺术的优秀代表和杰出的社会活动家，在我们知识分子中享有很大声誉。丁玲的长篇小说“太阳照在桑干河上”，赵树理的“李家庄的变迁”等，大大地帮助了我们了解了中国人民的英勇斗争。虽然我们译出来的中国作家的作品不多，可是我们对于四十三个作家的个别作品仍然是熟悉的。同志们，我可以向你们提出诺言，我们将把你们所要创作的最优秀的作品，都译成俄文。
    我们的国家是一个新的国家，在文化发展上有三十二年的经验。在我们国内，广大群众在文化上都提高了，他们在热爱地吸收以往人类所创造的以及现在世界上进步人士所创造的一切最优秀的东西，因此，亲爱的同志们，请你们相信：我们不仅以热诚来把我们全部最好的经验贡献给你们，而且我们一定很注意地来研究中国几千年发展的全部经验，尤其要研究中国人民对世界文化发展所贡献出的一切东西。我很荣幸地向中国知识分子中优秀的事业家致敬，因为在中国人民和俄国人民的性格中，有很多东西是相近的。我们留在这里的日子将成为最大幸福的日子，永远留在我们心里。我们与你们同住在面积广大的土地上，我们的人民是非常众多的。历史使我们的心灵广阔而开朗。
    我们作为胜利者登上世界的舞台。
    伟大的、强有力的、英勇的、爱好劳动的中国人民万岁！
    把自己的学识贡献给人民的中国知识分子万岁！
    中苏两大民族兄弟的友谊，互助和互敬万岁！
    中国人民优秀的儿子和中国人民领袖毛泽东万岁！
    整个进步人类的朋友和领袖，我们的导师斯大林万岁！
