　　Taking Advantage of the Interruption of Beijing-Suiyuan Railway Traffic to Hoard Grain and Raise Prices Will Be Severely Punished
　　Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce Warns Grain Merchants
    [Beijing News] After the Ministry of Railways ordered the interruption of Beijing-Suiyuan traffic on the 27th to prevent the spread of the plague in Chahar, grain from the Northwest could not be transported to Beijing temporarily. Yesterday (the 29th), some grain merchants in the city's grain exchange took the opportunity to hoard grain and raise prices. To this end, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce specially convened a meeting of more than 100 people from grain shops, rice and flour industries, and mechanized flour industries yesterday (the 29th) afternoon. Director Cheng Hongyi and Deputy Director Peng Cheng explained in detail that the government is making great efforts to eliminate the plague in Chahar, and for this reason, it has been decided to suspend transportation on the Beijing-Suiyuan line for a very short time. As for the city's grain supply, the Grain Corporation has sufficient strength and will definitely not encounter difficulties. If a few merchants who do not understand the general situation dare to take the opportunity to hoard grain and raise prices, disrupt the market, engage in speculation and hoarding, and refuse to sell, they will be severely punished and will suffer economic failure, bad luck, financial losses, and will reap the bitter fruit of their own actions.

    京市商业局警告粮商
    【北京讯】自铁道部为防止察北鼠疫蔓延，于二十七日下令隔绝京绥交通后，西北粮食暂时不能运京，昨（二十九）日本市粮食交易所有些粮商，乃乘机哄抬粮价。为此，京市商业局特于昨（二十九日）日下午召集粮栈业、米面业、机制面粉业百余人开会，由程宏毅局长、彭城副局长详细说明政府正以大力扑灭察北鼠疫，为此，特决定于极短时间暂停京绥线运输。至于本市粮食供应，粮食分公司现有充足力量，绝对不致发生困难，如有少数不明大义的商人，敢于乘机哄抬粮价，捣乱市场，投机囤积，争购拒售，必将得到严厉制裁，并在经济上遭受失败倒霉赔钱自食其恶果。
