　　Leaders of Various Parties and Organizations Issue Written Statements
　　Thanking the Soviet Union for Recognizing New China and Celebrating the Establishment of New Diplomatic Relations Between China and the Soviet Union (Part 4)
　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] After the announcement of the Soviet government's initial recognition of New China, leaders of various democratic parties and organizations have successively issued written statements expressing their gratitude and warmly supporting the establishment of diplomatic relations and the exchange of ambassadors. The written opinions of the persons in charge of the All-China Students' Federation, the National Industry and Commerce Circles, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Congress of Natural Science Workers are now continued as follows:
　　The day after the founding of our own country—the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China—was proclaimed, the Soviet government immediately recognized it and expressed its willingness to establish truly equal diplomatic relations with our country. After receiving this news, all of us students across the country are welcoming this great friendship with the most excited and enthusiastic feelings. As early as 1919, the All-China Students' Federation, established after the May Fourth Movement, sent a letter to the Soviet Union, the world's first socialist country belonging to the working people, expressing friendship and respect to them. However, during the years of the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people was constantly and brutally undermined. Even so, the Soviet Union not only extended a hand of friendship to us, helping us defeat Japanese imperialism, but also cracked down on the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism. Now that the Chinese people have overthrown the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and stood up, the Soviet people's "consistent desire to strive to establish truly friendly relations with the Chinese people" has finally been fully realized. The formal establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union once again demonstrates the Soviet Union's deep friendship with the Chinese people. This friendship will strengthen the power of the world democratic camp and is a powerful guarantee for world lasting peace.
　　From this, we deeply understand the great and profound significance of Chairman Mao's instruction to us to "lean to one side" towards the Soviet Union. We must, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, closely align ourselves with the Soviet Union led by the great Stalin and learn from the advanced socialist country of the Soviet Union. We will learn from the Soviet Union's experience in revolution and construction, learn from the Soviet Union's advanced culture, art, and scientific knowledge, as well as the Soviet people's heroic and firm patriotism and great internationalism, in order to accelerate the great construction of our New China. Xie Bangding
　　The Soviet Union's recognition of the People's Republic of China and the exchange of ambassadors have brought unlimited joy to the people of the whole country. The note contains the statement that it is convinced that the Chinese Central Government is the representative of the will of the vast majority of the Chinese people, which shows that the expression of the people's will is powerful and invincible. However, American imperialism continues to violate the will of our people and conspires to sabotage; the Soviet Union has confirmed the will of our people and immediately responded to the establishment of diplomatic relations. It is even clearer who is the enemy and who is the friend. There are now two major fortresses in the world, one is the peace fortress headed by the Soviet Union, and the other is the war-mongering fortress headed by the United States. We stand on the side of the peace fortress, which is what Chairman Mao called "leaning to one side." Commander-in-Chief Zhu reported the news of the Soviet Union's recognition at the World Congress for the Defense of Peace, and the whole audience cheered wildly, because there are two major countries in the world defending peace, fighting side by side, and the war-mongering fortress on the other side cannot be destroyed. In the future, our people should strengthen their confidence and strengthen their courage to lean to one side.
　　The Soviet Union has recognized the People's Republic of China first! This is a major event that has shaken the world. This tells the millions upon millions of people around the world who are fighting for people's democracy and lasting peace: the socialist country with 200 million people and the new democratic China with 475 million people are closely united and working hand in hand, and this power is unparalleled; although the imperialist aggressive group, which is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, is still frantically pursuing its conspiracy to enslave the people of the world and launch a new war, this conspiracy is destined to go bankrupt. This has also educated the broad masses of the Chinese people: Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction "lean to one side" is absolutely correct, and only socialist countries and the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe that are moving towards socialism are the true friends of the Chinese people. All the Chinese people are rejoicing and celebrating for this. We deeply thank the Soviet people led by the great Stalin for their profound and sincere friendship. We firmly believe that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people will develop and consolidate day by day. It goes without saying that there will be difficulties in the road of peaceful construction in New China, but since we have the correct leadership of the Communist Party, the hard work and heroism of the working people, the cooperation of all revolutionary classes, and the help of the great friendly country of the Soviet Union, any difficulty can be overcome and will inevitably be overcome. I would like to tell the Soviet friends our joyful and excited mood: The establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and us is a manifestation of the deep friendship and common interests of the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union. The close cooperation between our two major nations will be a huge guarantee for the cause of democracy and peace in the world. Long live the friendship between China and the Soviet Union! Mao Dun
　　On October 3rd, after Commander-in-Chief Zhu announced the news that the Soviet Union had formally recognized the People's Republic of China at the China Peace Congress, thunderous shouts and applause like firecrackers immediately erupted from the entire audience. In the shouts and applause, countless people walked to the Soviet delegation, shaking hands and embracing, celebrating wildly for more than ten minutes. I have never seen such a warm mood, happy atmosphere, and lively scene in my life.
　　This is like squeezing air, being squeezed into a container, its volume shrinking to the point where it can no longer be reduced, and suddenly opening a hole, it will naturally make a startling sound and erupt. We recall that in 1917, China was oppressed by many imperialist countries for nearly eighty years, and the Soviet Union was the first to announce to us the abolition of unequal treaties. We also recall that in 1926, the Soviet Union unconditionally helped the Chinese revolution and swept away the Northern Warlords. Even more, we recall the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, when the Soviet Union first signed a non-aggression treaty with China, and soon sent a volunteer air force to help us with their lives and flesh and blood. Finally, we recall that in 1945, the Soviet Union swept away the 800,000-strong Kwantung Army for us with thunderous force.
　　How should the Chinese people feel grateful and thank such an allied country? Under Chiang Kai-shek's tyrannical power, the Chinese people have always dared not speak out, suppressing a stomach full of words and unable to speak. Now, on the second day of the founding of the People's Republic of China, hearing this good news and in front of the Soviet representatives, the shouts and applause will naturally and uncontrollably erupt in an instant.
　　From now on, the Chinese people can satisfy their wishes and establish friendly diplomatic relations with the great socialist country—the Soviet Union—through their own government. This is truly the first great happy event of the People's Republic of China.

　　各党派团体负责人发表书面意见
    感谢苏联承认新中国庆贺中苏建立新邦交（四）
    【本报特讯】苏联政府首先承认新中国的消息发表后，各民主党派团体负责人纷纷发表书面意见，表示感谢，并热烈拥护建立外交关系并互派大使。兹续将中华全国学生联合会、全国工商界、中华全国文学艺术界联合会、中华全国自然科学工作者代表大会筹备会负责人的书面意见发表如下：
    在我们自己的国家——中华人民共和国中央人民政府宣告成立的第二天，苏联政府立即予以承认，并愿与我国建立真正平等的外交关系，我们全国同学得到这个消息以后，都在以最兴奋热烈的心情来欢迎这种伟大的友谊。早在一九一九年，在五四运动以后成立起来的中华民国学生联合总会，就曾经致函世界上第一个属于劳动人民的社会主义国家苏联，向他们表示友谊和敬意。但是在蒋介石国民党反动统治的岁月里，中苏人民的友谊一直被横加摧残着。就是这样，苏联还不但向我们伸出友谊的手，帮助我们击败了日本帝国主义，还打击了美帝的侵略阴谋。现在中国人民推翻了国民党反动统治，抬起头来，苏联人民“力求与中国人民建立真正友好关系的始终不渝的意愿”终于得到完全实现了。中苏邦交的正式建立，又一次表示了苏联对中国人民的深厚的友谊。这种友谊将加强世界民主阵营的力量，是世界持久和平的有力保证。
    从这里，我们深切地体会到毛主席指示我们的向苏联“一边倒”的伟大而深刻的意义。我们一定要在中央人民政府的领导下，和伟大的斯大林所领导的苏联紧紧靠拢在一起，向先进的社会主义国家苏联学习。学习苏联革命与建设的经验，学习苏联先进的文化艺术与科学知识，以及苏联人民英勇坚定的爱国主义精神与伟大的国际主义精神，以便加速我们新中国的伟大建设事业。谢邦定
    苏联承认我中华人民共和国并互派大使，全国人民无限的欢欣。其照会内有确信中国中央政府是绝大多数中国人民意志的代表者一语，可以见人民意志之表现是强大无敌的。但是美帝国主义继续违反了我人民意志，阴谋破坏；苏联则确认我人民的意志，立即答复建立外交关系，孰为敌孰为友于此更可判明。现在世界上两大堡垒，一为以苏联为首的和平堡垒，一为以美国为首的战贩堡垒。我们站在和平堡垒这边，即毛主席所谓“一边倒”。朱总司令在保卫世界和平大会上报告苏联承认消息，全场欢呼若狂，为的是世界上有两大保卫和平的国家，并肩奋斗，那边的战贩堡垒没有不可以摧毁的。以后我们人民应加强信心，加强勇气一边倒。
    苏联首先承认中华人民共和国了！这是一件震动全世界的大事。这告诉全世界的为人民民主与持久和平而斗争的千千万万的人民：二万万人的社会主义国家和四万万七千五百万人的新民主主义中国密切联合携手了，这力量是无比强大的；外强中干的帝国主义侵略集团尽管还在疯狂地推行它的奴役世界人民、发动新战争的阴谋，然而它这阴谋，命定了是要破产的。这又教育了中国广大人民：毛主席的英明指示“一边倒”，是绝对正确的，只有社会主义国家以及走向社会主义的东欧各新民主主义国家是中国人民真正的朋友。全中国人民为此而欢欣鼓舞。我们深深感谢伟大的斯大林所领导的苏联人民对我们的深厚无比的真挚热烈的友谊。我们深信，中苏两国人民的友谊将日益发展，日益巩固。新中国在和平建设的道路上，不用说，是有困难的，可是我们既有共产党的正确领导，劳动人民的勤劳英勇，各革命阶层的协力，再加以伟大友邦苏联的友谊的帮助，任何困难都可以克服，而且必然能够克服。我愿意把我们的欢欣鼓舞的情绪告诉苏联友人：苏联与我们外交关系的建立，是中苏两大民族的深厚友谊和利害相同的表现，我们两大民族的亲密携手，对于世界的民主和平事业，将是一个巨大的保障。中苏友谊万岁！茅盾
    十月三日，朱总司令在中国保卫世界和平大会上，宣布了苏联正式承认中华人民共和国的消息后，全场立即发出雷一般的呼声和爆竹一般的掌声。在呼声和掌声中，有数不清楚的人走向苏联代表席前，握手的握手，拥抱的拥抱，狂欢了十几分钟。这种热烈的情绪，快乐的气氛，和热闹的场面，我生平未曾见过。
    这，仿佛压榨空气，被压榨在一个容器里，它的容积缩小到无可再缩，忽然开一个孔，当然要一鸣惊人，爆发出来了。我们回想到一九一七年，那时中国被许多帝国主义国家压迫了将近八十年之久，而苏联首先对我们宣布废除不平等条约。又回想到一九二六年，苏联无条件地帮助中国大革命，把北洋军阀扫清。更回想到一九三七年的抗日战争，苏联首先与中国订立不侵犯条约，不久，又派空军志愿队来，把生命和血肉帮助我们。最后回想到一九四五年，苏联以雷霆万钧之力，替我们扫除了八十万关东军。
    象这样一个盟邦，中国人民对她该应如何感激，如何申谢，而在蒋介石淫威之下，中国人民一向不敢作声，压住了一肚皮话说不出来。而今，在中华人民共和国开国的第二天，听到了这个好消息，又当着苏联代表的面，那呼声和掌声当然要情不自禁地顷刻爆发出来了。
    从此以后，中国人民可以满足自己的愿望，由自己的政府，与伟大的社会主义国家——苏联建立友好的外交关系，这真是中华人民共和国第一件大喜事。
