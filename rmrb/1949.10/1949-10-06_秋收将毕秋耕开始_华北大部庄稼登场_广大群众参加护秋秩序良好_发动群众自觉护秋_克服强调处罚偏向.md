Autumn Harvest Nears Completion, Autumn Planting Begins
Most Crops in North China Threshing
Broad Masses Participate in Autumn Protection, Orderly
Mobilize the Masses to Consciously Protect the Autumn
Overcome the Tendency of Emphasizing Punishment

[Report from this newspaper] Currently, the autumn harvest in the North China region is nearing its end, and most crops have been successively threshed. According to a report from Yanbei on September 14th, two-thirds of the naked oats on the mountains north and south of Hun County have been harvested, and the naked oats in the eighth district of Guangling have been completely harvested; the situation in other counties is roughly the same. Under the slogans of preventing wind, hail, and sabotage by bandits and special agents, and protecting the autumn harvest, all localities have widely organized male and female labor forces, and under the slogan of "harvesting while planting," most of the naked oat fields on the mountains in Yanbei have been cultivated; more than half of the land in Chabei has also been cultivated.

During this year's autumn harvest, all localities have attached great importance to the work of autumn protection. Therefore, social order has generally been good, and farmers have been able to carry out harvesting peacefully. In Pingyuan Province, under the working policy of eliminating remnant bandits, preventing sabotage by individual landlords and rich peasants, protecting the autumn harvest, and preparing for wheat planting, new districts were called upon to establish green crop protection teams. The Anyang Prefectural Committee organized strong armed work teams to lead the autumn harvest. In areas with better work, the idea of "everyone protecting the crops" was promoted, creating a mass autumn protection movement, organizing villages to watch crops at night, militia to patrol at night, establishing a system of sentry calls and alarms, and mobilizing villages to support each other. In the Ding County sub-district of Hebei, 70% of the villages have established autumn protection organizations and formulated autumn protection covenants. There are three forms of autumn protection organizations: one is that village cadres use administrative power to organize all the masses aged eighteen to forty-five to take turns watching the crops; the second is to use Party members, cadres, and militia as the backbone, and call on the masses to freely form groups according to residence and location; the third is for a small number of militia to patrol the fields without mobilizing the masses. Of the above three, the first is prone to commandism and is not sustainable; the third does not mobilize the masses and is less effective; the second is the best. The Yanbei and Chanan regions attach particular importance to the control of opium smokers, and many places have adopted the method of centralized control at night and production during the day, combined with smoking cessation, with good results. However, in the above autumn protection work, some deviations have also arisen: such as in the autumn protection covenants, only emphasis is placed on punishment, not on education. For example, Xifuluo Village in Anguo stipulates: stealing one ear of grain, adults are fined one斗 of rice, children half a斗, and cadres two斗; some villages in Boye stipulate: the first time "broadcast", the second time parade with a tall hat; Wu Yangping in Ding County stipulates: stealing one ear is fined five斤. This situation can easily lead to a chaotic state of arbitrary fines and deductions. The second deviation is that in isolating petty thieves and bad elements, the main method is not education and persuasion, but holding large meetings to "select petty thieves" (more than 50 were selected in Xiyu Village in Anping; 377 were discussed in fifteen villages in the seventeenth district of Ding County), posting "bad guy lists," and forming "petty thief groups." This approach is bound to create more confusion in the countryside, making it difficult for farmers to concentrate on the autumn harvest; the third is that in the control of opium smokers, a simple detention is formed. The above three deviations are all manifestations of commandism, and although they are a minority phenomenon, they are also extremely serious and should arouse the vigilance of all localities.

In early and mid-September, some areas suffered from wind and hail disasters. The second and third districts of Datong suffered hail disasters on the 4th and 5th, reducing production by about half; in Hebei, a total of 101 villages in Boye, Li County, Raoyang, Xingtang, and Xinle suffered hail on August 31st and September 3rd, with heavy damage to most crops, reducing production by more than half, and lighter damage reduced production by about one-third; on the evening of September 19th, there was heavy rain near Zhangjiakou, and hail also fell in Zhangbei and Chongli in Chabei and some counties in Chanan, and the extent of the damage is still unclear. In Fuping County, on the afternoon of August 24th, 181 villages suffered severe wind damage, with most of the millet falling off, all the sorghum blown down, and heavy losses to beans.

Preparations for wheat planting started early, especially in the flood-stricken areas of Hebei. Great achievements have been made in draining water and getting land ready, and great importance is attached to solving the problem of wheat seed difficulties for disaster victims. There are three ways to solve the wheat seed problem in Liangxiang, Hebei: (1) Relying on the masses to lend and adjust each other, which is the main method; (2) Converting part of the grain loan into wheat seeds to help disaster victims; (3) Promoting the exchange of coarse grains for wheat seeds in non-disaster areas. However, the masses in some new districts still have concerns about wheat planting. For example, in Liangxiang, where land has only been adjusted but land reform has not been carried out, land rights are not determined, and some poor peasants still want to exchange for better land; middle peasants are afraid of drawing more land than the average; landlords and rich peasants also demand that land rights be determined quickly so that the remaining land can be planted with wheat. Based on the above situation, publicizing policies is a very important issue.

### 秋收将毕秋耕开始　华北大部庄稼登场　广大群众参加护秋秩序良好  发动群众自觉护秋　克服强调处罚偏向

　　秋收将毕秋耕开始
    华北大部庄稼登场
    广大群众参加护秋秩序良好
    发动群众自觉护秋
    克服强调处罚偏向
    【本报讯】目前华北区的秋收已近结束阶段，大部庄稼已陆续登常据雁北九月十四日报告，浑县南北两山已收割三分之二，广灵八区莜麦已割完；其他县亦大体相同。各地在防止风雹、匪特破坏、保卫秋收的口号下，均广泛组织了男女劳动力，并在“一面收，一面耕”口号下，雁北山上莜麦地并已大部耕过；察北也耕地过半。
    今年秋收中，各地均甚重视护秋工作。因此，社会秩序一般良好，农民得安于进行收割。平原省在肃清残匪、防止个别地主富农破坏，保卫秋收，准备种麦的工作方针下，在新区号召普遍建立看青队组织，安阳地委并组织强有力的武工队，领导秋收；工作较好地区，则提倡“人人看青”，造成群众性的护秋运动，组织各村夜间看青、民兵夜间巡逻，建立会哨与警报制度，发动各村相互支援。河北定县分区，已有百分之七十的村庄建立起护秋组织，并订立了护秋公约。护秋组织有三种形式：一种是村干部以行政力量，把年满十八岁至四十五岁的群众，全部组织起来，轮班看护；二种是以党员、干部、民兵为骨干，号召群众按居住、地段自由结组；三种是少数民兵下地巡逻，未发动群众。以上三种，第一种容易发生强迫命令，不易持久；第三种没有发动群众，收效较小；以第二种最好。雁北、察南地区，特别重视对烟民的管制，许多地方采取夜间集中管制，白天进行生产的办法；并和戒烟结合起来，效果很好。但在以上护秋工作中，也产生若干偏向：如护秋公约中，只注重处罚，不重视教育。如安国西伏落村规定：偷一穗庄稼，大人罚米一斗，小孩半斗，干部二斗；博野有的村规定：第一次“广播”，第二次戴高帽游街；定县吴羊平规定：偷一穗罚五斤。这种情况，极易造成乱罚乱扣的无政府状态。第二种偏向，则是孤立小偷坏分子中，也不是以教育劝说为主要办法，而是开大会“选小偷”（安平细雨村选出五十余名；定县十七区十五个村内讨论出三七七名），贴“坏人榜”，编“小偷组”，这种做法，势必造成农村益加混乱，农民难于安心秋收的恶果；第三是在管制烟民中，形成单纯地扣押。上述三种偏向，均系强迫命令作风的表现，虽属少数现象，但亦至为严重。须引起各地警惕。
    九月上、中旬，部分地区发生风雹灾。大同二、三区于四、五号先后受雹灾，约减收一半；河北之博野、蠡县、饶阳、行唐、新乐共一百零一个村，于八月三十一日、九月三日先后落雹，重者大部庄稼砸毁，减收一半以上，轻者亦约减收三分之一；九月十九日晚，张垣附近大雨，察北之张北、崇礼及察南若干县内亦落雹，损失情况尚不明。阜平县则于八月二十四日下午，一八一村受严重风灾，谷子大部脱落，高粱全部刮倒，豆类亦损失甚重。
    种麦准备工作都下手甚早，尤以河北水灾区更加重视。排水脱地已获巨大成绩，并十分重视解决灾民之麦种困难。河北良乡解决麦种办法有三：（一）依靠群众互相借贷调剂，这是主要的；（二）变一部贷粮为麦种，帮助灾民；（三）非灾区则提倡粗粮换麦种。但在部分新区内群众种麦还有顾虑，如良乡只调剂过土地但未进行土地改革地区，地权未定，一部分贫农还想换些好地；中农怕抽多过平均数的土地；地主富农也要求快确定地权，留下的土地好种麦。根据以上情况，宣传政策，便是十分重要的问题了。
