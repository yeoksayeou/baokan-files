　　The fourth year of the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan is coming to an end. Under the leadership and inspiration of the Lenin-Stalin Party, the Soviet people are working selflessly to realize the great Stalin plan to restore and further develop the Soviet national economy.

　　As the 32nd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution approaches, the Soviet people are striving to achieve new achievements in industry, agriculture, transportation, and the development of Soviet science and culture to commemorate this great festival.

　　The patriotism of the Soviet people is clearly manifested in the fact that all Soviet people are united in striving for the early completion of the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan.

　　The workers and staff of Moscow's enterprises are successfully fulfilling their obligations. Industry there has now reached the average monthly production level planned for 1950 in most extremely important products.

　　The Moscow "Caliber" Instrument Factory, the largest in the country, reported on August 10, 1949, that it had completed the Five-Year Plan in terms of total product value. The factory has now exceeded the 1950 level. Here, the cost of products has been reduced by 40 percent. In several workshops of the factory, thanks to the proposal of technician Losinsky, an extraordinary movement to transition to collective Stakhanovite work has emerged. In this factory, hundreds of labor heroes of the post-war Five-Year Plan are working, and their names are known to all the people. Among them are: Manelov, a file worker and Communist Party member who completed the 17-year quota in three and a half years for the construction of surveying instruments, and Sizilinikov, a representative of the Moscow Soviet who has completed the 16-year quota, etc.

　　The patriotic example of Muscovites has been warmly reflected among workers in Ukraine, Belarus, the Urals and Siberia, the Far East, and the Baltic coast.

　　Soviet miners have achieved remarkable achievements in completing the Five-Year Plan. Donbas, which was almost completely destroyed by the German occupiers, has now almost reached the pre-war level. The coal mining productivity in the Moscow coal-producing area has tripled compared to the pre-war level. The miners of the Moscow Coal Industry Corporation and the Tula Coal Industry Corporation have already reached the coal mining quality planned for the entire 1950 this year. Dozens of coal industry corporations in Donbas, Kuzbas, the Urals, and Karaganda have far exceeded the pre-war level.

　　The achievements of the Soviet coal mining industry are particularly noteworthy against the backdrop of the decline and crisis in the coal mining industry in the capitalist world.

　　The American coal mining industry only works three days a week. The British coal mining industry has not yet reached the 1913 level. The greed of capitalist monopolies leads to technological backwardness, stagnation, and regression. In the American coal mining industry, the number of mine collapse incidents is constantly increasing. According to official American materials, the number of miners killed and injured in mines during the World War exceeded twice the number of American soldiers killed in combat.

　　Not long ago, Soviet miners celebrated their holiday - Miner's Day. Before this festival, the great army of miners achieved a glorious victory. According to socialist obligations, 3.54 million tons of coal should be mined beyond the plan throughout 1949. Before Miner's Day, that is, four months ahead of schedule, the miners handed over 3.8 million tons of coal beyond the national plan to the state. Among the twenty-two coal industry corporations, eleven have already reached and exceeded the coal mining level planned for 1950.

　　Here, dozens of names of glorious Soviet patriots can be mentioned, whose merits have added to the glory of the motherland. Jiulinkov, a miner from the Kalinin Mine in Donbas and a hero of socialist labor, together with his fellow workers completed nine quotas in one shift on August 14 to commemorate Miner's Day. Kilekov, an advanced miner from the "October Coal Mine" Corporation, completed the quota for the Five-Year Plan as early as last August, and mined ten trains of coal planned for 1951 before Miner's Day. Magalinko, a miner from Krivoy Rog, embarked on the Stakhanovite post to commemorate Miner's Day and completed twelve and a half quotas in one shift.

　　In 1949, a completely new form of socialist competition emerged in Soviet industry, and this form has been widely disseminated. The first of these is the patriotic movement to accelerate the turnover of working capital, which has saved the country hundreds of millions of rubles. The struggle to save metal, fuel, and electricity, initiated by the workers and staff of the Kolomna and Sormovo factories, has been widely spread in various departments of the national economy and combined with the great patriotic initiative proposed by Kubava textile worker Roshneva and Kononenko to launch a socialist competition to increase the output of products from every kilogram of raw materials. Roshneva and Kononenko's proposal has great national significance. If one percent of cotton is saved in a year, then the Soviet people can fully supplement 46.8 million meters of cotton fabric. Saving one percent of leather raw materials can produce 2.4 million pairs of boots beyond the plan. Saving one percent of steel in a year can manufacture 2,500 locomotives.

　　The scope of socialist competition is becoming wider and wider. As early as 1948, there was not a single factory or workshop, or collective farm or state farm that had not participated in socialist competition. Socialist competition includes more than 90 percent of workers, engineering and technical personnel, and staff members in the Soviet Union.

　　Comrade Stalin taught that: "Competition is the communist method of building socialism on the basis of the highest activism of millions of working masses." This sentence of the leader has become the great banner of the Soviet people in the struggle to further consolidate the economic power of the socialist country. Among the Soviet people, who are filled with love for their motherland, new and extraordinary production innovators appear every day.

　　The names of Stalin Prize winners are known throughout the country and far abroad. Such as the organizer of collective Stakhanovite work, socialist labor hero Losinsky, the initiators of cyclical work, Bulikiko and Jiulinkov, Stalin Prize winner Chutkehe, the steelmaking technician Amosov of the Zlatoust Metallurgical Factory, the stonemason Belotertsev of Stalingrad, and hundreds of others who have added glory and power to their great motherland.

　　苏联人民争取先期完成战后五年计划的爱国斗争
    战后斯大林五年计划的第四年即将结束。列宁——斯大林党领导与鼓舞的苏联人民，刻正忘我地劳动，实现着恢复与进一步发展苏联国民经济的伟大斯大林计划。
    当此伟大十月社会主义革命三十二周年即将来临之际，苏联人民正竭力在工业、农业、运输业、苏联科学与文化发展事业中达到新的成绩以资纪念这一伟大节日。
    苏联人民的爱国主义，明显地表现在全体苏联人民同心一意竭力先期完成战后斯大林五年计划这一事实。
    莫斯科各企业的职工，刻正顺利地完成自己的义务。那里的工业，在多数极其重要的产品方面现已达到被计划在一九五○年的平均每月生产水平。
    全国规模最大的莫斯科“口径”仪器工厂，一九四九年八月十日报告业已在产品总额方面完成了五年计划。该工厂现已逾过一九五○年水平。在这里，产品成本降低了百分之四十。在该厂的若干车间中，由于洛西斯基技匠的提议现已产生了非凡的争取过渡到集体斯达汉诺夫工作中去的运动。在这个工厂中，有数百名战后五年计划劳动英雄劳动着，他们的名字，全体人民都知道。其中有：三年半完成了十七年定额的构造测量器具的锉工共产党员马内洛夫、业已完成了十六年定额的莫斯科苏维埃代表西齐林科夫等等。
    莫斯科人的爱国范例，在乌克兰、别洛露西亚、乌拉尔和西比利亚、远东和波罗的海沿岸的劳动者中间得到了热烈的反映。
    苏联的矿工，在完成五年计划中达到了显著成就。几乎被德国占领者完全破毁了的顿巴斯，现已几乎达到战前水平。莫斯科产煤区的采煤生产率比战前提高了三倍。莫斯科煤业联合公司和土拉煤业联合公司的矿工，今年业已达到被计划在整个一九五○年的采煤质量。顿巴斯、库兹巴斯、乌拉尔和卡拉岗达的数十个煤业联合公司业已远远超过战前水平。
    苏联采煤工业的成就，在资本主义世界采煤工业发生衰落与危机的图景上显得特别值得注目。
    美国的采煤工业，一周内只工作三日。英国的采煤工业尚未达到一九一三年的水平。资本主义垄断的贪欲，招致着技术的落后、停滞和倒退。在美国的采煤工业中，矿坑倒塌事件数目不断增长。根据美国的官方材料，当世界大战时期在矿坑中死伤的矿工数目超过美军在战斗中牺牲的两倍还多。
    不久前苏联矿工纪念了自己的节日——矿工节。在这一节日前矿工大军获得了光荣的胜利。根据社会主义义务一九四九年全年应超计划采煤三百五十四万吨。在矿工节前，即先期四个月，矿工们交给了国家超国家计划煤三百八十万吨。在二十二个煤业联合公司中，十一个业已达到并超过被计划在一九五○年的采煤水平。
    这里可以说出数十个光荣的苏维埃爱国主义者的名字来，他们的功勋增加了祖国的光荣。顿巴斯加里宁矿坑矿工、社会主义劳动英雄久林科夫，为纪念矿工节八月十四日同其工友一起于一班时间内完成了九个定额。“十月煤矿”联合公司的先进矿工基略科夫，早在去年八月就已完成了五年计划的定额，并在矿工节前开采了被计划在一九五一年的十列车煤。克里伏罗格的矿工马加林科，为纪念矿工节而踏上了斯达汉诺夫岗位后，一班便完成了十二个半定额。
    一九四九年，在苏联工业中产生了完全新的社会主义竞赛形式，这种形式并且得到了广泛的传播。属于这一形式的首先是争取加速流动资金流转的爱国运动，这一运动已为国家节省了若干亿卢布。由于科洛牟纳和索尔莫沃两工厂职工倡议而掀开的争取节约金属、燃料和电力的斗争，在国民经济各部门中得到了广泛传播，并结合了库巴瓦纺织工人罗施涅瓦和科诺年柯提议为从每公斤原料中增加制品出产展开社会主义竞赛的伟大爱国创举。罗施涅瓦和科诺年柯的提议有着巨大的国家意义。假如一年中节约百分之一的棉花，那么苏联人民可以充分地补充得到四千六百八十万公尺的棉织品。节约百分之一的皮革原料，就可以超计划制作二百四十万双靴子。用一年节约百分之一的钢，可以制造二千五百个机车。
    社会主义竞赛的范围愈来愈为广泛。早在一九四八年就已经没有一个尚未参加社会主义竞赛的工厂和作坊或者集体农庄和国营农场。社会主义竞赛包括了苏联百分之九十以上的工人、工程技术工作者和职员。
    斯大林同志教导说：“竞赛是在千百万劳动群众最高积极性基础上建设社会主义的共产主义方法。”领袖的这句话在争取进一步巩固社会主义国家经济威力的斗争中业已成为苏联人民的伟大旗帜。在充满了热爱祖国之感的苏联人民中间，每天都出现有新的非凡的生产革新者。
    斯大林奖金荣膺者的名字遍闻全国和远达国外。如集体斯达汉诺夫工作的组织者社会主义劳动英雄罗西斯基、循环工作的倡议者卜里基科和久林科夫、斯大林奖金荣膺者褚特克赫、兹拉托乌斯特冶金工厂的炼钢技工阿莫索夫、斯大林格勒的石匠别洛捷尔彻夫及其他数百名为自己的伟大祖国增加了光荣和威力的人们。
