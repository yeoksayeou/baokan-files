　　Soviet Union Publishes Selected Works of Lu Xun
　　Large Chinese-Russian Dictionary Being Compiled

    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th] Moscow dispatch: The Soviet Union is increasingly publishing Russian translations of Chinese literary works and is compiling a large Chinese-Russian dictionary. The selected works of the Chinese writer Lu Xun (in two volumes) are being printed. The first volume is a collection of Lu Xun's short stories, and the second volume includes his political essays, literary reviews, various lectures, and speeches. The Publishing Bureau of Literature has also published a collection of prose and poetry by Bai Juyi, the famous 9th-century Chinese poet. These works depict the suffering of the Chinese working people and their longing for freedom. The staff of the Leningrad Institute of Oriental Studies is compiling a large Chinese-Russian dictionary. This dictionary will be unique, based on the new achievements of Soviet Sinology. The dictionary is divided into three volumes, with nearly 300,000 words, including terms from the new China. The first volume has already been printed. At the same time, Sinologists are also working on compiling a Chinese-Russian dictionary that includes many important terms and colloquialisms from the Chinese language.
