    [From Our Newspaper] The North Jiangsu Cotton Reclamation Survey Team, organized by the Shanghai Military Control Commission's Agriculture and Forestry Department, departed for North Jiangsu on August 26th and returned to Shanghai on the 11th of this month, having completed all survey plans. In light of the severe flooding in North Jiangsu this year, the water conservancy group plans to complete a 315-kilometer dike along the coast before next year's rainy season, and to dredge the outflowing river channels and tidal gates to facilitate drainage. Currently, the group members have remained stationed in North Jiangsu, working with over twenty technicians recently transferred from the Nanjing Water Conservancy Department and the Shanghai Cotton Training Class's water conservancy group to conduct surveying and other work.
