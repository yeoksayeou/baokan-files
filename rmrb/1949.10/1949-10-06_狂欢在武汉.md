    “The Chinese people have stood up!” Chairman Mao’s solemn declaration on September 21st thrilled the million people of Wuhan.

    Wuhan is the center of the strength of the “February 7th” General Strike. People have witnessed countless martyrs and heroes bleeding and sacrificing themselves in several revolutionary struggles, advancing wave upon wave, paying a huge price, and pursuing the people’s aspirations. Today, this glorious aspiration has finally been realized. How can we not revel and sing? Troops, staff, workers, farmers, students, shop assistants, merchants, and citizens all cheered, "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

    After the news of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference came, the cheers,锣鼓sounds, and firecrackers resounded throughout the city. Postal and telecommunications workers drove trucks to the newspaper office to help distribute extra editions, or used long-distance telephones to transmit the news to nearby counties. The garrison troops swore to swiftly eliminate the remnants of the reactionaries and liberate all of China. Nearly 100,000 organized workers proposed to greet this glorious day with practical actions. Employees of the Pinghan Railway wanted to complete the twenty-eight-day production plan in half a month. Dockworkers immediately increased from two people carrying ten boxes to seventeen boxes when handling military supplies. Workers in the ordnance factories automatically processed and rushed to repair mortars. Everyone dedicated all their enthusiasm and strength to greet the birth of the people's country.

    On the 30th, after the pattern of the national flag was published in the newspaper, various organs, troops, and businesses rushed to make them. The first to use the national flag as the guide for the parade was the Yangko team of 1,500 people composed of the Fourth Field Army and the directly subordinate units of the Central China Military Region. When they reached the bank of the Yangtze River, the beautiful red flag fluttered in the river wind, with a heroic and radiant appearance, arousing enthusiastic applause and cheers from the masses. On the day the Central People's Government was established, although the rain was falling non-stop, it did not stop the enthusiastic emotions of the masses. First of all, everyone surrounded and scrambled to read the newspapers that published the good news. Hundreds of Yangko teams, propaganda teams, and propaganda trucks performed in the streets in the rain. The rain soaked the red flags, the red slogans, and everyone's clothes and faces, which added to the people's glory and pride.

    The happiest day was October 2nd. The beautiful red flag turned the whole city red. Golden and brilliant arches were erected on some of the main streets. A procession of 150,000 organized people passed through the crowded streets and headed to Zhongshan Park Square to hold a grand celebration. The conference opened with one hundred and twenty salutes. Dozens of flares rising into the sky burst into countless silver snakes. Suddenly, music played, firecrackers exploded, and everyone tried their best to wave the red flag. Then, the People's Liberation Army, who had contributed to the country, were presented with flags. The red flags danced even more happily, the drums beat even louder, and the Yangko naturally twisted. People threw up the small flags, clothes, hats, newspapers, and baskets in their hands for more than ten minutes. What a great power, let us and our friends celebrate, and let the enemy tremble! The majestic national anthem was sung, every word and every sentence was so familiar, reminding people of the history of disasters and struggles of the Chinese people for more than ten years. The Chinese Communist Party once used this song to awaken the people living in suffering and groaning in disaster, and led them to carry out heroic struggles, finally expelling Japanese imperialism and defeating the Kuomintang bandit gang supported by American imperialism. The national anthem inspired people, not only with the confidence to defend the motherland, but also to defend world peace. General Lin Biao declared at the conference: We are not only the liberators of China, but also the defenders of world peace. An old worker who participated in the "February 7th" General Strike said: "We can win and we can defend peace!" At night, this huge team began a demonstration parade, entering the brightly lit streets, everywhere with the sound of firecrackers,锣鼓sounds, and cheers. The twenty-three dragon lanterns of the dockworkers danced from the north end of Jianghan Road to the riverbank. All kinds of colorful lanterns performed various games. Everyone was so young under the light! The Chinese people have stood up.

　　狂欢在武汉
    本报驻武汉记者  金沙  林晰
    “中国人民站立起来了，”九月二十一日毛主席的这个庄严的宣示振奋了武汉百万人民。
    武汉是“二七”大罢工斗争力量的集中地，人们曾目睹着无数先烈英雄在数次革命斗争中流血牺牲，前仆后继，付出了巨大的代价，追求人民的愿望，今天这个光荣的愿望终于实现了，怎么会不狂欢歌唱呢？部队、工作人员、工人、农民、学生、店员、商人、市民一齐欢呼着“中华人民共和国万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    人民政协会议的消息传来后，全市的欢呼声、锣鼓声、鞭炮声响彻云霄，邮电工人开卡车到报社协助散发号外，或把消息用长途电话传送到附近各县去。警备部队宣誓要迅速地消灭反动派的残余势力解放全中国。近十万有组织的工人提出要以实际行动来迎接这一光辉的日子。平汉路职工要把二十八天的生产计划半月完成。码头工人搬运军火时由过去两人抬十箱，立即增到十七箱。兵工厂工人自动加工赶修迫击炮。每个人都献出了自己的所有热情和力量来迎接人民国家的诞生。
    三十日，报上公布了国旗图样后，各机关部队商家，纷纷赶制。首先以国旗为游行前导的是第四野战军及华中军区直属队组成的千五百人的秧歌队，行至扬子江畔时，美丽的红旗在江风中舒卷，雄姿焕发，光彩夺目，引起了群众热情的掌声，欢呼声。中央人民政府成立的那天，虽然雨在不停的下，但并没有阻止了群众的狂热情绪。首先大家包围争读刊登喜讯的报纸。数以百计的秧歌队、宣传队、宣传卡车冒雨在街头表演。雨水下湿了红色的旗帜，红色的标语，和每个人的衣服和脸庞，这更增加了人民的光彩与骄傲。
    最欢乐的日子是十月二日，美丽的红旗映红了全市，在一些主要的街道上都扎起了金壁辉煌的彩楼。十五万有组织的群众行列，通过了人山人海的街道，走向中山公园广场，举行盛大的庆祝会。大会在一百二十响礼炮中揭幕，升入高空的几十枚照明弹爆裂出无数条银蛇，顿时全场音乐齐鸣，鞭炮爆响，每个人都尽力挥舞着红旗。接着给有功于国家的人民解放军献旗，红旗舞动得更欢，锣鼓敲打得更响，秧歌自然的扭起来了。人们抛起了手中的小旗、衣服、帽子、报纸以及蓝子，达十余分钟之久，这是多么伟大的力量，让我们和我们的友人欢庆，敌人发抖吧！雄壮的国歌唱起来了，每一字每一句这样熟悉，使人回忆起十多年来中国人民的灾难与斗争的历史来。中国共产党曾用这支歌子唤醒了生活在灾难中痛苦呻吟的人们，并领导了他们进行英勇的斗争，终于驱逐了日本帝国主义，战胜在美帝国主义支持下的国民党匪帮。国歌鼓舞了人们，不仅有信心来保卫祖国，并可以保卫世界和平。林彪将军就这样在大会上宣示：我们不但是中国的解放者，也是世界和平的保卫者。参加过“二七”大罢工的老工人说：“我们能胜利也能保卫和平！”入夜，这支巨大的队伍开始示威游行，进入了灯火辉煌的街道，到处是鞭炮声、锣鼓声、欢呼声，码头工人的二十三条龙灯，从江汉路北头一直舞到江边，各色各样的彩灯表演着各种游艺，每个人被灯光照耀得这样年青呵！中国人民站立起来了。
