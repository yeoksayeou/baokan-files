　　Defend World Peace
　　——A Record of the Tianjin People's Peace Demonstration
　　On the evening of October 2nd, while celebrating the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government, the people of Tianjin stood in the great ranks of the world's struggle for peace, expressing their desire for peace with strength.
　　The bright lights illuminated the People's Square, making it dazzling, with thousands of large and small red flags fluttering like waves, and ingenious colorful lanterns twinkling with flames. As the meeting began, and the national anthem finished playing, firecrackers exploded everywhere in the air, sparks splashing and flying straight into the sky. Instantly, dozens of white doves, symbolizing peace, fluttered in the night sky. The crowd cheered, and the sound of gongs and drums resounded deafeningly. More than five hundred Soviet expatriates, dressed in brightly colored costumes, also raised their arms and shouted "Hurrah" from time to time. Foreign guests on the rostrum walked to the edge of the stage and waved to the cheering masses. Hundreds of Yangko dance teams also became active at this time. The stage and the audience merged into one, continuing for twenty minutes before stopping.
　　Today, people expressed their deep desire for peace. The parade marched and shouted tirelessly from morning until after noon, even our children were like this. However, this is by no means fear. The Chinese people deeply understand from their own experience that only with their own strength can they defend true peace. As our Italian friend Spano said: "China is not striving for peace as sheep-like pacifists, but striving for peace in order to smash the forces of war." Our meeting showed such strength and confidence because we are a member of the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union. The heroic Chinese people stand together with the Soviet Union and the people of the world, and we can overcome all enemies at home and abroad! Fadeyev said: "In the cause of building an independent, democratic, and highly cultured New China, the Soviet people will do their utmost to help China."
　　Before the parade had even left the venue, the roads were already lined with crowds. They were not just watching; many of them were waiting specifically to join the great ranks of today's worldwide struggle for peace. Like a fiery dragon, on the Liberation Bridge, ships decorated with lanterns on the Hai River sped past, beating gongs and drums. Next to the department store, which shone with the eight characters "Long Live the Victory of the Chinese People," it was crowded again shoulder to shoulder. It was already two o'clock, and in some places people were still clapping, cheering, and singing to their hearts' content. The birth of the new China was truly exhilarating for our deeply suffering Chinese people, making it hard to sleep. The firm will to defend world peace encourages us to forge ahead courageously.

　　保卫世界和平
    ——记天津人民和平大示威
    十月二日的晚上，天津人民在庆祝中华人民共和国和中央人民政府成立的同时，他们站在全世界和平斗争的伟大行列的中间，用力量来表示爱好和平的愿望。
    雪亮的灯光将人民广场照耀得光彩夺目，飘扬着的千万面大小红旗如海浪起伏，巧妙的五彩缤纷的花灯，闪烁着盏盏火光。会议开始，当国歌奏毕的时候，空中到处鞭炮齐鸣，火花迸溅，直飞天上。刹时，数十只象征和平的白鸽，翩翩飞翔夜空。人群欢呼时起，锣鼓声震天动地的敲打起来。穿着鲜艳服装参加大会的五百余苏联侨民时时也振臂高呼“乌拉”。主席台上外国来宾们都走到台口来向千万欢呼群众招手致意。数百个秧歌队这时候也活动起来。台上台下连成一片，一直继续了二十分钟才告停息。
    人们在今天对于和平表示了深切的愿望，游行的队伍从早晨直到中午以后，还呼喊着奔走着，不知疲倦，连我们的孩子们也是如此。但是，这绝不是骇怕，中国人民切身的经验深深懂得，只有用自己的力量，才能保卫真的和平，象我们意大利的朋友斯巴诺所说的一样：“中国不是如绵羊似的和平主义者那样为争取和平，而是为了粉碎战争的力量而争取和平。”我们的会议表现得这样有力量有信心，这是因为我们是以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的一员，英勇的中国人民和苏联及世界人民站在一齐，我们就可以战胜一切内外敌人！法捷耶夫说：“在独立的民主的有高度文化的新中国建设事业上，苏联人民对于中国尽其所有的力量来帮助他。”
    游行的行列，尚未走出会场，马路就立满了人群，他们不但是仅仅观望，他们其中有很多人专等着参加到今天全世界和平斗争的伟大行列中去。象一条火龙似的解放桥边，海河上张灯结彩的轮船，敲着锣鼓奔驰而过，在闪耀着“中国人民胜利万岁”八个字的百货公司的旁边，又拥挤得挨肩擦臂。时间已经两点了，有的地方还在拍手、欢呼和尽情的歌唱，新的中国的诞生对于我们灾难深重的中国人民实在是使人兴奋得难以安睡。保卫世界和平的坚强意志，鼓舞着我们奋勇前进。
