Review of Ouyang Shan's "Gao Qian Da"
People's Literature and Art Series, No. 1
Zhu Keyu
    After reading "Gao Qian Da," as well as the opinions of comrades Zhao Shuli and Hu Jiao on "Gao Qian Da" (the former published in the People's Daily on October 7, 1948, the latter published in the first issue of North China Literature and Art), I also have some opinions to put forward for discussion. If there are any errors, I hope to receive corrections.
    "Gao Qian Da" is a book of about 150,000 words, divided into twenty-four chapters. From the development of the whole book, it can be divided into three stages:
    From the first chapter "The People's Demands" to the sixth chapter "Rupture" is the end of the old practices of the Renjia Gou Cooperative. It is the preliminary victory of the cooperative's deputy director Gao Shenglian (i.e., Gao Qian Da)'s communist party member's enthusiasm, creativity, and mass line, and under the support of the masses and the district secretary Zhao Shijie, over the experienced empiricism and bureaucracy of the director Ren Changyou and the district chief Cheng Haoming. This is a struggle between two working styles and two leadership styles on the theme of the cooperative.
    From the seventh chapter "New Direction" to the fourteenth chapter "Mockery and Comfort" is the business development of the cooperative under the new direction, setbacks, and redevelopment; Ren Changyou and the young shaman Hao Si'er combine to oppose Gao Qian Da, and the style of district chief Cheng Haoming strengthens this combination. District Party Secretary Zhao Shijie returned from the Yan'an Cooperative Director Conference and firmly supported Gao Qian Da. Gao Qian Da struggles, wavers, and finally perseveres in the midst of business busyness, failures, physical fatigue, illness, and the attacks of various backward forces. The cooperative's shares developed from 10,000 to hundreds of thousands, and the rooms developed from five broken houses to seven large houses, three kitchens, and more than ten stables and pigsties... more luxurious than the largest landlord's home in the past. In terms of business, in addition to the pharmacy, they set up a textile factory, a "small bank," a transportation team, contracted public bonds and public salt for the government, and in terms of personnel, they absorbed three wealthy men, two small businessmen, a peddler, and a veterinarian... From four or five poor public cadres, they developed into twenty or so handsome young clerks.
    From the fifteenth chapter "Disputes" onwards to the last chapter "Victory", the story gradually turns to the anti-shaman struggle. In the four consecutive chapters "Haunted," "The Story of the Green Snake," "The Ghost's Family," and "Fierce Battle," the author pushes this struggle to an extremely tense climax. Finally, Gao Qian Da and the shaman Hao Si'er engage in a fierce hand-to-hand fight, and both fall into a deep gully with exposed stone tips more than ten or twenty feet deep. Hao Si'er falls to his death, but Gao Qian Da does not die. In the last chapter, the author says that everyone discovered that the Renjia Cooperative was in line with the direction of the "South District Cooperative" and received rewards from all sides. The Renjia Gou Cooperative was victorious.
    The above is the main thread of the book. Interspersed within is the love story between Gao Qian Da's son, Gao Shuan'er, and Ren Changyou's daughter, Ren Guihua. Ren Guihua was originally engaged to Gao Shuan'er, and the two were in love. Ren Changyou broke off the engagement because of his break with Gao Qian Da and betrothed her to Hao Si'er, but the relationship between Ren Guihua and Gao Shuan'er was not severed. From the second chapter onwards, the development of this love is intermittently arranged in each chapter, and after the anti-shaman struggle, this love occupies a large part of the space and reaches a relationship that is inextricably linked with the anti-shaman struggle.
    As Comrade Zhao Shuli said, "Gao Qian Da" is indeed a very good novel that exposes subjectivism and bureaucracy. The author has very well written the images of the cooperative director Ren Changyou and the district chief Cheng Haoming: Ren Changyou understands how to say "We are organized and led," "The political tasks given to us by the higher authorities do not need to be discussed, we cannot shirk difficulties, and we are not allowed to bargain." But he forgets the most basic point: whether the cooperative has given the people real benefits. When the common people are unwilling to pay the shares apportioned by the cooperative, he only blames them for not obeying government decrees, but does not understand or study the reasons behind it. When Gao Qian Da understands the needs of the people and wants to engage in medical cooperation, he retorts that he is destroying the original cooperative. When the higher authorities decide that both should engage in it, he knows that he has no future and asks for leave to leave his post. When Gao Qian Da's cooperative has greatly developed, instead of reflecting on his mistakes, he says that if the government had allowed this to be done earlier, he would have opened it up long ago. At this time, his loyalty to the Party and the revolution becomes questionable. He marries his daughter to Hao Si'er, the shaman who opposes Gao Qian Da, which shows his ideological situation and his hatred for Gao Qian Da. Finally, he gets drunk and dies on the night of his daughter's wedding. Cheng Haoming understands how to say "investigation and research," but in reality, he does not investigate or research. When the common people welcome Gao Qian Da's method, he says: "It is also possible that one or two villages of common people welcome it... Even if the common people welcome it, we cannot be the tail of the masses." However, when the shamans unite with several backward elements to dismantle Gao Qian Da's platform, he says, "Now the common people are coming out to speak... The common people have opinions..." He always feels that Gao Qian Da's approach has exceeded the scope stipulated by the government, and believes that Gao Qian Da is innovative, self-contained, and personally prominent. He "relies on past experience" and believes that Gao Qian Da is spreading the ideological experience of capitalism in the location of the Communist Party Central Committee. Until the end, he was transferred to study and realized the mistakes of his empiricism and bureaucracy.
    However, judging from the whole book, anti-empiricism and anti-bureaucracy cannot be said to be the central theme of the book. In terms of its weight, the anti-shaman struggle occupies more space; in terms of the structure of the whole book, the anti-shaman struggle occupies a more important position. Judging from the author's handling of the different endings of Cheng Haoming, Ren Changyou, and Hao Si'er, the author regards anti-empiricism and anti-bureaucracy as an internal ideological struggle, and the anti-shaman struggle as an external hostile force. Comrade Hu Jiao said: "The anti-shaman problem occupies such an important position in the book. After reading the whole book, one gets the impression that the anti-shaman struggle is the struggle against feudal remnants." This is a representative feeling. And in terms of the author's writing skills and techniques, the anti-shaman struggle gives readers a deeper impression than the anti-subjectivism and anti-bureaucracy struggle.
    Then, is the anti-shaman struggle the central theme of the book? I don't think so either.
    What the author tries to tell us readers in this book is a typical character, a typical character who is mostly a communist party member and partly a farmer - Gao Qian Da. This specific character is the central theme of this novel, at least that is the author's intention. Because Gao Qian Da runs through the whole book and is the core of every activity and every struggle. In his struggle with Ren Changyou and Cheng Haoming, the author writes about his positive side as a communist party member, and in his anti-shaman struggle, he fully writes about his weaknesses as a farmer. In his running of the cooperative, the author writes about his profound understanding of the standards of the cooperative... For example, he said to his son: "Those warlords, corrupt officials, and landlords, and more recently the imperialists, and further back the emperors and prime ministers, they have exploited us for five thousand years, they have exploited everything, taken everything away, taken it all. What is left for us is only poverty and backwardness. We have overthrown them, but we must also overthrow poverty and backwardness... But how can you shoot at poverty and backwardness... After thinking about it, we decided to organize cooperatives to revolutionize poverty and backwardness." But he knows nothing and cares nothing about his son's love affair with Ren Guihua... From all aspects, it can be seen that the author's energy is concentrated on every scene and every struggle that Gao Qian Da comes into contact with, and he tries to write vividly and in accordance with Gao Qian Da's identity and standards. And these scenes and struggles can be divided into three aspects in general: first, the struggle against empiricism and bureaucracy; second, the struggle in the business development of the cooperative; and third, the anti-shaman struggle, which is consistent with the three stages of the whole book mentioned above. (Naturally, these three aspects of struggle are intertwined and combined, and they should be.) Before I read this book, different readers had introduced this book to me. Some said that this book is a novel against subjectivism and bureaucracy, some said that this book is a novel against shamans, and more people introduced it to me as: this is a novel about cooperatives. I think these three statements reflect the three aspects of the content of "Gao Qian Da", and at the same time, it can also illustrate that none of these statements can fully explain the central theme of the book alone.
    It is precisely from this understanding that the success of "Gao Qian Da" lies, in my opinion, first in its vivid depiction of a typical active rural party member in a transitional period, although the author is more skilled in writing about his backward side than in writing about his positive side; secondly, in his writing about cooperatives. As far as I know, this is still the only one in the literature and art of the liberated areas. It was not easy for the author to choose the theme of cooperatives to write about before the liberation of major cities in 1946; and thirdly, the author very well exposed empiricism and bureaucracy on the issue of cooperatives.
    Regarding the first two points, I would also like to say a few words in passing:
    Because the people like novels with strong stories, it is not wrong for our authors to try their best to make the stories of novels strong. But on the other hand, as far as I know, the reason why old novels such as Dream of the Red Chamber and Water Margin are read by the people over and over again is not so much because of the strong stories of those novels, but because of the rich characters or the strong typicality of the characters in those novels. Furthermore, if it is said that because in today's great historical transformation, what the people pay attention to first are all kinds of new events or stories that have never existed in history, therefore, authors write these stories, and these stories are either participated in by the authors themselves, or attract the authors, this is not wrong. But on the other hand, as far as I understand, on the basis of a certain understanding of policies, on the basis of a certain understanding of reality or historical events, writing deeply about new typical characters through stories will have greater educational significance for the people, and it will definitely be more welcomed by the people than novels that only have strong stories. My emphasis on the success of "Gao Qian Da" in this regard is also based on this understanding.
    Secondly, it is right that the first thing to be reflected in today's rural reality is the vigorous land reform struggle. But on the other hand, we should also look further ahead from the perspective of the development prospects of the rural individual economy, from the significance of the cooperative economy in the road to rural socialization. Writing novels about mutual aid groups and cooperatives with typical significance in rural areas will not only be welcomed by the people, but also be one of the important tasks for our authors to guide and educate the people through novels today. In this regard, it is not difficult to understand from the situation after the liberation of major cities today. My emphasis on the success of "Gao Qian Da" in this sense is precisely because of this reason. At the same time, it is even more difficult for the author to have written "Gao Qian Da" before 1946.
    It is precisely because of this understanding that I will talk about what shortcomings "Gao Qian Da" has. This is almost a demanding request for the author, but criticism, like creation, is to seek the height that principles can possibly reach. The three points I put forward below are the main shortcomings of "Gao Qian Da". Comrade Zhao Shuli's opinion does not mention this, and Comrade Hu Jiao only raises questions and hypothetical answers.
    Comrade Hu Jiao said: The author lets Ren Changyou die after getting drunk, "I am afraid that this is not the best way. The ending of the failure to the physical destruction is negative." This has already touched the key point. But Comrade Hu Jiao asked: "Is it because the author thought that since Ren Changyou had broken with Gao Qian Da and returned home, it would be difficult to write the article later, so he let him die drunk?" This did not solve the problem. Ren Changyou's break with Gao Qian Da can be resolved through criticism and self-criticism, and he can also come out again to run the cooperative after returning home. Moreover, how can it be difficult to write the article later after breaking up and returning home? In fact, the problem is not here. The problem lies in why the author did not make Ren Changyou and Gao Qian Da reconcile through the Party's due self-criticism; in why Ren Changyou was not allowed to return to the cooperative? We can imagine that after Ren Changyou returned to the cooperative, according to Ren Changyou's ideological situation, he is likely to proceed from the conclusion of "If the government had allowed this to be done earlier, I would have opened it up long ago" and move towards another extreme, that is, the extreme of capitalist economic thinking that Cheng Haoming opposed. And with the cooperative absorbing wealthy men, small businessmen... and developing so greatly, it is inevitable that a deeper internal ideological struggle will unfold. The key lies in whether the author has grasped this ideological principle and grasped the materials related to this ideological struggle. However, judging from "Gao Qian Da", the author did not digest the materials he had grasped well in the business development of the cooperative, and did not deeply explore its internal laws. The author could not grasp the complex ideological struggle that should have been had when Ren Changyou returned to the cooperative, especially after Ren Changyou had already joined forces with the shaman Hao Si'er. (Or, the objective situation did not provide him with appropriate materials.) But other than letting him return to the cooperative, Ren Changyou had nowhere to go. For such an old cadre, the author could neither let him completely merge with Hao Si'er, nor could he, as an author, fulfill his responsibility to explain the ending of this character. The only way was to let him die at the same time as his daughter was married to Hao Si'er. Therefore, the author's writing about the business development of the cooperative seems to have a lot of materials and lacks ideological content. This is the first shortcoming of the book.
    Secondly, Comrade Hu Jiao said: "I feel that the author's description of the shaman is too exaggerated, and it is a bit of a fuss, especially the latter part of the story about haunting is too lengthy and has a sense of dullness." But in fact, the chapters after haunting are precisely a climax of the anti-shaman struggle that the author has carefully constructed, and it is also the climax of the whole book. What is the reason for this? This is due to the first shortcoming mentioned above, and also because the author has set his main task as shaping a typical character, and at the same time, perhaps he has more love for the anti-shaman struggle and it is easier to collect materials. The author lets the shamans play the role of the greatest and final obstacle in the development of the cooperative. The main reason why the author made Hao Si'er die in a way that is not very consistent with the spirit of the policy can also be found here. But in reality, this is not realistic. This is not only because it does not conform to the general situation of the old liberated areas, but also because: the opposition of the shamans originally came from the initial medical cooperative. After the cooperative has developed countless times, there is no reason for the shamans to continue to play such a serious role. This means that the reality of the cooperative has moved forward, and the author's pen has fallen behind. Furthermore, from the perspective of anti-feudal superstition, Comrade Zhao Shuli said: "A reasonable solution has been obtained in this book," I feel that there are also problems. After reading the booklet "The Shaman's Confession", it can be seen that the author has taken a lot of materials from this booklet. However, from the perspective of opposing feudal superstition, the article "The Shaman Bai Conghai's Confession" is much more educational and powerful than what is written in "Gao Qian Da". This means that art has fallen behind its material. Also, in the article "Launch an Anti-Shaman Struggle", it is said that the anti-shaman "in the positive aspect is to carry out medical and health construction without delay". At the same time, in the article "Breaking Superstition in Buzhang Village", it is said how the doctor Cui Yueshun cured the people of their illnesses and how he constantly made propaganda to break superstition, so that the villagers did not believe in the shamans, which not only reduced the people's deaths and difficulties, but also saved a lot of waste. It is very obvious that the task of truly defeating the shamans cannot be completed by political work alone, let alone by a cooperative director. In this book, the cooperative doctor Li Xianghua disappeared like a shadow. The burden of anti-shamanism is placed on Gao Qian Da's shoulders, but Gao Qian Da can only turn the shaman into a deep gully and fall to his death, and almost die with him.
    Thirdly, as mentioned above, because the author's grasp of the actual and ideological principles of the cooperative is not enough, he has to use Hao Si'er as a partner for Gao Qian Da, but how to make them a partner? The author found the love between Gao Shuan'er and Ren Guihua. From Ren Changyou's annulment of the marriage, to the development of Gao Shuan'er letting Hao Si'er seize the handle, the three people are tied together in a strange relationship. It can be seen that the author has a comprehensive and careful consideration. However, love as an interlude should always be able to explain its social essence. For example, the love interlude in Simonov's "Russian Question" clearly states the essence of love in capitalist society. But what about here? Nothing has been explained. The whole love story seems to be mainly serving that chapter "The Story of the Green Snake". Therefore, the strange relationship between these three people always feels very unnatural, and Ren Guihua and Gao Shuan'er also appear vague and unreal.
    If the above analysis is correct, then we can also understand: how an author's mastery of actual life through policies and ideological principles determines the significance of the success or failure of a work.

　　评欧阳山的“高乾大”　
    人民文艺丛书之一
    竹可羽
    读了“高乾大”，以及赵树理和胡椒两位同志对“高乾大”的意见（前者发表在一九四八年十月七日的人民日报上，后者发表在第一期华北文艺上），我也有一些意见，提出来和大家讨论，如有错误，希望能得到指正。
    “高乾大”全书约十五万字，共分二十四章。从全书发展上看，可分三个阶段：
    从第一章“人民的要求”到第六章“破裂”是任家沟合作社旧做法的结束。是副主任高生亮（即高乾大）的共产党员的积极性、创造性、走群众路线，并在群众拥护和区书记赵士杰的支持下对正主任任常有、区长程浩明两人的经验主义和官僚主义的初步胜利。这是在合作社这一主题上两种工作作风和两种领导作风的斗争。
    从第七章“新的方向”到第十四章“嘲笑和安慰”是合作社在新方向下业务上的发展，受挫折，再发展；任常有和青年巫神郝四儿结合，反对高乾大，区长程浩明的作风加强了这种结合，区委书记赵士杰参加了延安合作社主任会议回来，进而坚决地支持了高乾大；高乾大在业务的繁忙、失败、身体的疲劳、疾病和各种落后势力的夹攻中苦斗、动摇，终于坚持下去。合作社股金从一万发展到几十万，房间从五间破屋发展到七间大房子，三间灶房，还有十来间马棚猪圈……比过去最大地主家还阔气。业务上除了药铺，办了纺织工厂，“小银行”，运输队，替政府包公债、包公盐，在人事上吸收了三个财主，两个小商人，一个货郎担，一个兽医……从四五个公家穷干部发展到二十几个漂亮小伙计。
    从第十五章“纠纷”以后到最后一章“胜利”，渐渐转向反巫神斗争，到“闹鬼”、“青蛇的故事”、“鬼的家庭”、“恶斗”连续的四章，作者把这个斗争推上极度紧张的高潮，最后高乾大和巫神郝四儿肉搏恶斗，两人一道翻下十几二十丈深的石头尖儿露出地面的深沟里，郝四儿跌死了，高乾大没有跌死。最后一章，作者说，大家发现任家合作社正合乎“南区合作社”的方向，得到了各方面的奖励，任家沟合作社胜利了。
    以上是全书的主线。其中穿插了高乾大儿子高拴儿和任常有女儿任桂花间的恋爱故事。任桂花原和高拴儿订有婚约，两人也相爱，任常有因和高乾大破裂撤了这婚约，转许给郝四儿，但任桂花和高拴儿两人的关系没有割断。从第二章起，各章断断续续布排着这个恋爱的发展，到反巫神斗争以后各章这恋爱占了很大的篇幅，并且达到了和反巫神斗争血肉难分的那种关联。
    正是赵树理同志所说，“高乾大”的确是很好地揭发了主观主义和官僚主义的一本小说，作者很好地写出了合作社主任任常有和区长程浩明的形象：任常有懂得说“咱们是有组织，有领导的”，“上级给咱的政治任务，不必讨论，不能推托困难，不许讨价还价。”但忘记最基本的一条：合作社是否给了人民真正的利益。老百姓不愿交合作社摊派的股金，他只会责备他们不遵守政府法令，却不了解，不研究其中的道理。当高乾大了解人民需要，要搞医药合作社时，他反说他破坏了原来的合作社，当上级决定了两家都搞时，他知道自己没有前途便请假离开了岗位；当高乾大的合作社大大地发展了，他不反省自己的错误，却说要是政府早允许这样搞，他早就搞开了。到了这时候，他对党对革命的忠诚就有了问题，他把女儿嫁给反对高乾大的巫神郝四儿，就可以看他的思想情况和他对高乾大的恨劲。最后，在出嫁女儿那天晚上喝醉了酒，一家伙醉死了。程浩明是懂得说“调查研究”，实际上不调查研究，老百姓欢迎高乾大的办法时他说：“那也可能有一两个庄子的老百姓欢迎……退一步说就算老百姓欢迎吧，我们也不能当群众的尾巴。”但是，当巫神们联合了几个落后分子要拆高乾大的台时他却说“现在老百姓出来说话了……老百姓有意见……”他总觉得高乾大的一套超出了政府规定的范围了，认为高乾大标新立异，自成局面，个人突出，他“凭过去经验”认为高乾大在共产党中央所在地传播资本主义的经验思想。直到最后，他被调去学习，才认识了自己的经验主义和官僚主义的错误。
    但是从全书看，反经验主义和官僚主义不能说是本书的中心主题，从其分量上来说，反巫神斗争占着更多篇幅；从全书结构来说，反巫神斗争占着更主要的位置，从作者对于程浩明、任常有和郝四儿不同结局的处理，作者是把反经验主义和官僚主义作为内部思想斗争，把反巫神斗争作为外部敌对势力看的。胡椒同志说：“反巫神问题在书中是占着如此重要的地位，读完全书，给人一个印象，似乎反巫神斗争就是反对封建残余斗争。”这是有代表性的感觉。而从作者的笔力和技巧的运用上说，反巫神斗争较之反主观主义和官僚主义斗争，给了读者更深的印象。
    那末，反巫神斗争是本书的中心主题吗？我看也不是。
    作者努力要在本书中告诉我们读者的是这样一个典型人物，一个大半个是共产党员，小半个还是农民的典型——高乾大。这个具体的人物就是这本小说的中心主题，至少作者的企图是如此。因为高乾大贯穿着全书，是全书每一个活动，每一个斗争的核心。作者在他和任常有、程浩明的斗争中写出他作为共产党员的积极的一面，而在他反巫神斗争上充分地写了他的作为农民的弱点。在他办合作社当中，作者写了他对合作社的深刻的理解水准……如他对儿子说：“那些军阀、贪官、地主，说近些还有帝国主义，说远还有皇帝和宰相，他们剥削咱们五千年，他们把什么都剥削完了，都拿走，都拿得光光的了。剩下给咱们的只有贫穷，只有落后，咱们打倒了他们，还要打倒贫穷和落后……可是你怎么能对贫穷和落后放枪呢……咱们想了一想就决定组织合作社来革贫穷和落后的命。”而写他对于他儿子和任桂花的恋爱，却一无所知，毫不关心，……从各方面看来，看得出作者的精力集中在高乾大所接触的每个场面，每个斗争，设法写得生动，写得合乎高乾大的身份和水准。而这些场面，这些斗争，总起来说可分三方面，第一是反对经验主义和官僚主义的斗争；第二是合作社业务发展上的斗争，第三是反巫神斗争，是和前面所说全书分三个阶段相一致的。（自然这三方面的斗争，是互相渗透的和结合着的，而且也应该如此。）在我未读本书以前，曾经有不同的读者向我介绍这书，有的说这书是反主观主义和官僚主义的小说，有的说这书是反巫神的小说，更多的人向我介绍说：这是一本写合作社的小说，我以为这三种说法正反映着“高乾大”内容的三个方面，同时，也可以说明任何哪一种说法，单独地说，都不能全面地说明本书的中心主题。
    正是从这样的理解，“高乾大”成功的地方，我以为首先在于他生动地写出了一个过渡时期的积极的农村党员的典型，虽然作者在写他落后的一面比起写他积极的一面更要熟练些；其次在于他写了合作社，据我所知，这在解放区文艺中还是仅有的一部，作者一九四六年各大城尚未解放以前选择了合作社这一主题来写，这是并不容易的事；再其次，就是在合作社问题上作者很好地揭发了经验主义和官僚主义。
    关于前两点，我还想顺便说两句：
    因为人民喜欢故事性强的小说，所以我们作者写小说时尽量把故事性写得强一点，这没有错。但另一方面，据我所知道，如红楼梦，水浒等旧小说之为人民百读不厌，较之那些小说的故事性强，那些小说中的人物性格的丰富或说人物的典型性强，是起着更大的作用的。再，如果说，因为在今天这样的一个历史的大转变中首先为人民所注目的是各种各样历史上从来没有过的新的事件或故事，因此，作者们写出这些故事来，而且这些故事或者也为作者自己所参与，或者也吸引了作者的，这没有错，但另一方面据我所理解，在一定的政策的认识基础上，在一定的现实或历史事件的认识基础上，通过故事深入地写出新的人物典型来，这对于人民将有更大的教育意义，并且较之仅仅故事性强的小说一定更被人民所欢迎。我之重视“高乾大”在这上面的成功，也是根据这样的认识或理解的。
    其次，对今天农村现实，首先应该反映轰轰烈烈的土地改革斗争，这是对的。但是另一方面，我们也看远一点从农村个体经济发展前途看，从合作社经济在农村社会化道路的意义上去看，写农村中具有典型意义的互助组，合作社等小说，不仅会为人民所欢迎，而且在今天正如我们作者们要通过小说去指导教育人民的重要任务之一。在这上，在今天各大城市解放后的情况去看是不难理解的。我之重视“高乾大”在这意义上的成功，也正由于这个道理。同时也由于作者在一九四六年以前就写出了“高乾大”，这是更不容易的一件事情。
    也正由于这样的理解，再来说说“高乾大”有着些什么缺点。这对于作者，几乎可以说是一种苛求，但批评之和创作一样，都是寻求原则的可能到达的高度来落笔的，我在下面提出的三点，是“高乾大”中主要的缺点，关于这，赵树理同志的意见上是没有提到的，胡椒同志也仅提的是疑问和假设的答复。
    胡椒同志说：作者让任常有喝醉酒一死了之“恐不是顶好的办法。失败者走到肉体毁灭的结局是消极的。”这里已经是触到了要点。但是胡椒同志问：“作者是不是因为任常有既然和高乾大决裂了回了家，以后文章不好做，于是让他醉死拉倒呢？”这却没有解决问题。任常有和高乾大决裂，是可以通过批评和自我批评解决的，回了家也是可以从新出来搞合作社的，而且，决裂回了家，以后文章又怎么不好做呢？实际上问题并不在这里，问题在于作者为什么不使任常有和高乾大通过党的应有的自我批评而和解；在于为什么不让任常有回到合作社来？我们可以设想，任常有回到合作社来以后，依照任常有的思想情况，他很可能从“如果政府早允许这样搞，我早已搞开了”这个结论出发，走向另一极端，即程浩明所反对的那个资本主义经济思想的极端。而合作社在吸收了财主，小商人……那样大大地发展了的情况下，随着有更深刻的内部思想斗争展开也是必然的。一切关键就在，作者是否掌握住了这个思想原则，掌握住有关这个思想斗争的材料，但是从“高乾大”上看作者在关于合作社业务发展上，并没有很好地消化他所掌握的材料，没有深入去发掘其内部规律，对于随着业务发展，让任常有回合作社，特别当任常有已和巫神郝四儿搞在一起回合作社后，所应该有的复杂的思想斗争，作者无法掌握，（或者客观情况也未曾提供他适当的材料。）但是除了让他回合作社以外，任常有是无地可容的了，对于这样的老干部作者既不能让他和郝四儿完全合流，而作为作者所应有的责任又必须交待这个人物的结局，唯一的办法就只有让他在女儿嫁给郝四儿同时死去，因此使得作者在写合作社业务的发展上，显得材料庞杂，缺乏思想内容，这就是本书的第一个缺点。
    其次，胡椒同志说：“我感到作者描写巫神太过分强调了，未免有些小题大做，尤其后部写闹鬼的篇幅实在太冗长，而有沉闷之感。”但实际上，闹鬼以后各章正是作者最精心构造起来的一个反巫神斗争的高潮，也正是全书的高潮。这是由于什么呢？这是由于上面所说的第一个缺点，也由于作者规定自己的主要任务是塑造一个人物典型，同时可能也由于对反巫神斗争有更多爱好，更容易搜集材料，作者让巫神们担任了合作社发展中最大和最后阻力的角色，作者为什么让郝四儿与政策精神不很相合地死掉的主要原因，也可以在这里找到。但是实际上这是不现实的，这不仅因为不合于老解放区一般情况，也因为：巫神们的反对原来由于最初那个医药合作社而来，当合作社不知多少倍地发展了以后，这样严重的角色还让巫神们来担当，这是没有理由的。这是合作社的现实向前了，作者的笔落了后。再从反封建迷信的观点上来看，赵树理同志说：“在本书中得到了合理的解决，”我觉得也是有问题的。读了“巫神的坦白”这一本小册子，看得出作者有好多材料从这小册子上来的。但是其中“巫神白从海的坦白”一文，从反对封建迷信上说，比起“高乾大”里面所写的教育意义要强得多，也有力得多。这是说，艺术落在它的素材后头了。又，其中“展开反对巫神斗争”一文上说，反巫神“在积极方面就是要刻不容缓的进行医药卫生建设”。同时在“破除迷信的卜掌村”一文上说，医生崔岳舜如何为人民治好病，如何不断作破除迷信的宣传，使得村人不信巫神，既减少了人民的死难，又节省了许多浪费。——这是很显然的，要真正打败巫神，不是单靠政治工作所能完成任务的事，更不是一个合作社主任所能完成任务的事。在本书里，合作社医生李向华只象影子一样一幌不见了。反巫神的担子放在高乾大肩上，但是高乾大只能把巫神翻到深沟里去跌死罢了，而且差点儿自己也死在一起。
    第三，如上所说，由于作者掌握合作社实际及思想原则的不够，不得不以郝四儿来作高乾大的配搭，但是怎样使他们配搭起来呢？作者找到了高栓儿和任桂花的恋爱，从任常有的撤婚起，发展到高栓儿让郝四儿抓住把柄，三个人以一种奇怪的关系纽在一起止，看得出作者是有着全盘周密的考虑的。但恋爱之作为穿插，总要能说出其社会本质来才好，如西蒙诺夫的“俄罗斯问题”上的恋爱穿插，是明明白白地说出了资本主义社会里的恋爱本质来的。而在这里呢？却什么也不曾说明。整个恋爱故事，好象，主要是为了那一章“青蛇的故事”在服务，因此，对这样三个人的奇怪的关系，总觉得非常不自然，任桂花和高栓儿这样两个人物也显得模糊，不真实。
    如果上面的分析没有错的话，那末我们也就可以理解：一个作者对于生活实际通过政策和思想原则的掌握，怎样地决定着作品成败的意义。
