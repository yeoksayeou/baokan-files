　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 10th, TASS, The Hague: According to the Dutch Communist Party's "Truth Daily," Sajan, the General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, telegraphed Dutch Prime Minister De Dries, requesting permission for a World Federation of Trade Unions delegation to go to Indonesia to investigate the situation of Indonesian trade unions. Dutch newspapers previously reported that with the direct help of American agents, the Dutch army and the Hatta group destroyed the central organization of Indonesian trade unions, killing many central and local trade union leaders, such as the well-known trade union leader Harino. Currently, Indonesian trade unions have become underground organizations. So far, the Dutch government has not responded to the requests of the leading organs of the World Federation of Trade Unions.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 9th, TASS, The Hague, July 7th: The so-called Hague "Round Table Conference" continues to discuss financial and economic issues. The Netherlands demands that the future government of the United States of Indonesia bear the debts accumulated by the Dutch government in recent years, including those incurred from engaging in colonial wars against the Indonesian people. It is pointed out that the total debt will be nearly 8 billion guilders by the end of this year. In addition, the Netherlands requires that the entire economic and fiscal policy of the future United States of Indonesia, as well as Indonesia's trade agreements with other countries, be subject to the control of the Dutch authorities. The Dutch government hopes to have thousands of Dutch officials, qualified as experts, work with Indonesians in all government agencies of the future United States of Indonesia. The Dutch news agency reported that the United States now supports this proposal, believing that it can guarantee American investment in Indonesia.
　　Negotiations on military issues are also continuing. The Netherlands has agreed to supply the future Indonesian army with a considerable amount of weapons, ammunition, and military instructors. According to a Dutch news agency, the US State Department has also agreed to provide Indonesia with "technical assistance."
　　Journalists pointed out that the Hague Conference is currently conducting a cruel and ruthless bargaining between imperialism and Indonesia. The American representative of the Indonesian Committee, Cochran, is exerting pressure to end the Hague Conference as soon as possible. Journalists pointed out that American monopoly capitalists are trying to include Indonesia in the Pacific anti-communist bloc as quickly as possible.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 9th, TASS, Brussels, July 7th: The Belgian newspaper "Front" commented on the American invasion of Indonesia, stating that the Dutch colonial group was very anxious about the news of the negotiations conducted by Hatta and Cochran, the American representative of the Indonesian Committee of the Security Council, in May of this year. According to existing information, these negotiations decided to hand over all of Indonesia's oil resources and rubber plantations to the Americans. It is said that this secret agreement was signed in Yogyakarta even before Hatta and Cochran went to The Hague. The agreement stipulates that the United States will invest ten billion US dollars in the oil and rubber industries in the next five years. Seventy percent of the investment will be allocated to Standard Oil, Shell Oil, Goodyear Tire, and US Rubber. In addition, an American company called "Fox" (which concluded an agreement with Hatta) will be granted a fifteen-year monopoly on the production of tin and bauxite.

　　赛扬致电荷政府总理要求派代表团赴印尼
    调查美荷摧残职工会暴行
    【新华社北京十日电】塔斯社海牙讯：据荷共真理报载称：世界工联总书记赛扬致电荷兰总理德里斯，要求允许世界工联代表团赴印尼研究印尼职工会情况。荷兰报纸前曾报道：荷军与哈达集团在美国代理人的直接帮助之下摧残了印尼职工会中央组织，杀死许多中央与地方职工会领袖，如著名工会领袖哈利诺等。目前印尼职工会已成为地下组织。迄今荷兰政府对于世界工联领导机关的要求尚未给以任何回答。
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社海牙七日讯：所谓海牙“圆桌会议”继续在讨论财政与经济问题。荷兰要求未来的印尼合众国政府承担近年来荷兰政府所累积的债务，包括那些因从事对印尼人民的殖民战争而产生的债务在内。据指出：到今年年底债务总计将近八十亿盾。此外，荷兰要求未来的印尼合众国的整个经济与财政政策以及印尼与其他国家的贸易协定全都要受荷兰当局的控制。荷兰政府希望将成千的荷兰官员以专家资格与印尼人一起在未来的印尼合众国一切政府机构内工作。荷兰通讯社报道：美国现在支持荷兰这一建议，认为这样可以保证美国在印尼的投资。
    关于军事问题的谈判也在继续进行。荷兰已同意供给未来的印尼合众国陆军以相当数量的武器、弹药和军事教官。荷兰通讯社消息称：美国务院也同意给印尼以“技术援助”。
    新闻界人士指出：目前海牙会议正在进行帝国主义对于印尼的残酷无情的讨价还价。印尼委员会的美国代表柯契伦正施展压力，要求尽早结束海牙会议。新闻界人士指出：美国垄断资本家企图尽可能快地将印尼包括在太平洋反共集团内。
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社布鲁塞尔七日讯：比利时“阵线”报评论美国侵入印尼称：荷兰殖民集团对于哈达与安理会印尼委员会美国代表柯契伦在今年五月所进行的谈判的消息，甚感焦急。据现有的消息：这次谈判决定将印尼的一切石油资源与橡胶种植园交由美国人经营。据称：这种秘密协定甚至在哈达与柯契伦赴海牙以前就已在日惹签订。该协定规定今后五年内美国将在石油与橡胶工业上投资十亿美元。投资的百分之七十将分配给美孚油公司、壳牌油公司、固特异橡胶公司与美国橡胶公司。此外，美国还有一家“福克斯”公司（该公司曾与哈达缔结协定）将得到锡与铁矾土生产的十五年垄断权。
