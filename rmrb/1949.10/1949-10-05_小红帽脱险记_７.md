　　Little Red Riding Hood's Escape
    ７
　　　　　(4)
　
    Tomorrow night,
    Tomorrow night comes quickly.
    The sun is going home,
    The sky is slowly darkening,
    Everything that fears the sunlight,
    Is preparing to become a hero.
　
    Little Red Riding Hood,
    Doesn't move at all,
    Only tightly hugs her head,
    Bitterly thinking there,
    Thinking even harder
    Than thinking about arithmetic problems.
    She is so lonely,
    Only has an old grandma,
    Who, besides dozing off,
    Just mutters and mumbles her scriptures.
    She asks grandma for ideas,
    But grandma can't hear anything clearly,
    Every time she says this:
    "Don't bother me,
    Pray to the Bodhisattva,
    The Bodhisattva blesses,
    The Bodhisattva blesses!"
    But, tonight,
    The old mountain demon is coming,
    Bodhisattva, Bodhisattva,
    Is useless.
　
    Little Red Riding Hood,
    Doesn't want to listen to grandma's words to pray to the Bodhisattva,
    But also can't think of any other good ideas herself,
    She is so young,
    And doesn't have a gun or a knife,
    In the end,
    She still gets so anxious that
    She starts to sob,
    "嘤嘤嘤."
　
    "嗡嗡嗡, 嗡嗡嗡,
    Where did this child come from,
    Crying so fiercely?
　
    "Is that you,
    Little Red Riding Hood,
    Why are you crying?
    Why are you shouting?
    Do you want to eat candy?
    Then I'll give you some honey to taste,
    It's sweeter than candy,
    It's more fragrant than candy.
    Quickly stop crying,
    Quickly stop shouting,
    Shame on you, shame on you!
    What does it look like for
    A capable and useful child,
    To be crying?"
　
    "Grandma Bee,
    Don't wrong me,
    If you were me,
    I'm afraid you would have already anxiously hidden in your little nest.
    I don't want to eat candy,
    Nor am I just making noise,
    I'm crying sadly,
    Because no one is willing to help me.
    Tonight,
    That old mountain demon,
    He's going to come and eat me!
    I'm still so young,
    And I have to be his dinner,
    I'm really sad,
    I really don't want to!"
　
    "Ah!
    It's the old mountain demon,
    That old rogue,
    He wants to eat you?
    That's alright,
    I have a good idea,
    I will definitely help you.
    Quickly stop crying,
    And hide yourself well.
    If the old mountain demon comes,
    Look,
    I'll use my stinger to prick his eyes,
    So he can't see the road and can't find the door!"
　
    "Grandma Bee,
    I thank you for your kindness!
    But I know,
    You always live in the old mountain demon's garden,
    Gathering flowers and making honey,
    Dancing and singing,
    How would you be willing to help me?"
　
    "Hey,
    You really are a child,
    Not worldly-wise enough,
    This kind of muddlehead who only knows how to eat and sleep all day,
    I work hard to gather flower juice and make good honey,
    And he easily eats it all up.
    I'm working hard for him,
    And he still complains that we're too noisy,
    That he can't sleep well at noon,
    Chasing my little children
    Flying all over the sky,
    Running all over the ground.
　
    Besides,
    You've always been kind to us,
    I must help you,
    I must help you."
　
    Just as they were talking,
    The old mountain demon had already reached the hillside. (To be continued)

　　小红帽脱险记
    ７
　　　　　（四）
　
    明晚，
    明晚很快的就到了。
    太阳要回家了，
    天在慢慢的黑下来了，
    一切怕见阳光的东西，
    都在准备活动起来做好汉。
　
    小红帽，
    可一动也不动，
    只紧紧的抱着头，
    苦苦的在那里想着，
    比想什么算术题目，
    还要想得更难受。
    他是那么孤零零，
    只有一个老外婆，
    除了打瞌睡，
    就是卜读卜读的念她的经。
    他向外婆要主意，
    外婆一点也听不清，
    每次都是这么说：
    “不要吵我，
    求求菩萨，
    菩萨保佑
    菩萨保佑！”
    但是，今晚
    老山妖就要来了，
    菩萨菩萨，
    屁用也没有。
　
    小红帽，
    不愿听外婆的话求菩萨，
    但自己另外又想不出好办法，
    自己年纪小，
    又没有枪或刀，
    到后来
    还是急得
    嘤嘤嘤的哭起来了。
　
    “嗡嗡嗡，嗡嗡嗡，
    那里来个小孩子，
    哭得这么凶？
　
    “是你呀，
    小红帽，
    你为什么哭？
    你为什么叫？
    你是不是想吃糖？
    那我送点蜜你尝一尝，
    它比糖更甜，
    它比糖更香。
    快快不要哭，
    快快不要叫，
    羞啊，羞啊！
    一个能干有用的小孩子，
    哭哭啼啼象个什么样？”
　
    “蜂奶奶，
    你不要冤枉我，
    要是你是我呀，
    恐怕早已急得躲进了你那小窝窝。
    我不是想吃糖，
    也不是瞎吵闹，
    我伤心的哭，
    是谁也不肯来帮助我。
    今晚上，
    那个老山妖，
    他要来把我吃掉！
    我还这么小，
    就要做他的晚餐，
    实在伤心
    实在不愿！”
　
    “啊！
    是老山妖，
    那个老流氓，
    他想把你吃掉吗？
    那不要紧，
    我有好办法，
    一定帮助你。
    你快快不要哭，
    好好的躲起来。
    如果老山妖来了，
    你看，
    我用针刺他的眼睛，
    要他看不见路也摸不着门！”
　
    “蜂奶奶，
    我谢谢你的好意！
    但是我知道，
    你一向就住在老山妖的花园里，
    采花酿蜜，
    跳舞唱歌，
    怎样肯来帮助我？”
　
    “嗨，
    你真是小孩子，
    世故不深，
    这种整天只知道又吃又睡的糊涂虫，
    我辛辛苦苦采来花汁酿好蜜，
    他轻轻易易的吃得干干净。
    我替他卖了力，
    他还嫌我们太吵闹，
    他不能好好睡午觉，
    把我的小孩子们
    赶得满天飞，
    满地跑。
　
    再说，
    你对我们一向又和气，
    我一定要帮助你，
    我一定要帮助你。”
　
    正说着说着，
    老山妖可已经走到山坡上了。（未完）
