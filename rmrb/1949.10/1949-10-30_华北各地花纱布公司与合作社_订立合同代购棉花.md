　　Following the Hua Bei Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's signing of an agreement with the Hua Bei Supply and Marketing Cooperative in September regarding cotton procurement work, it has been widely implemented throughout the region. The agreement stipulates the organizational structure for cotton procurement, the principles for market division, and the method of entrusted purchasing. It also stipulates that the purchase price for cotton entrusted to cooperative members should be 2% higher than the market price, and cooperatives should receive a 2% commission. Cash purchases are also given a preferential treatment of 2% higher than the market price. After the agreement was signed, branch companies of the Hua Bei Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company in various locations have actively consulted with special commissioner offices and county cooperatives to discuss specific coordination measures and sign purchase contracts. According to statistics, five branch companies belonging to the company in Beijing, Baoding, Xinxiang, Shijiazhuang, and Linqing have signed entrusted purchase contracts with more than twenty county cooperatives, including Puyang, Xinji, Linqing, and Dingxing. Although the areas under the jurisdiction of the Tangshan, Handan, and Taiyuan branch companies have not formally signed contracts, entrusting cooperatives to purchase on their behalf has become an important form of acquisition. To better complete the acquisition work, the Linqing and Baoding branch companies convened cotton procurement meetings for their respective county cooperatives to discuss specific measures. Currently, cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas are mobilizing city-wide forces to set up purchasing stations and cotton picking teams to cooperate with the acquisition.
