　　The Black Stone Slope Coal Mine Chronicle (15)
　　Kang Tuo
　　Fourteen. Quitting

　　Da San went to the village to look for Yu Bao, but couldn't find him. Later, people directed him to Niu Bao's house.
　　At that time, Yu Bao was discussing how to deal with the big kiln with Niu Bao and Niu Bao's sister-in-law, and they were also figuring out how to deal with Da San. Yu Bao felt that they should also think about how to win over Da San, but Niu Bao strongly opposed it. At this moment, Da San arrived, and they were all red-faced and dumbfounded, unable to open their mouths. Da San, however, said as soon as he saw them, "Yu Bao! Last year, Xi Lu asked you to be the foreman to open the kiln, I really didn't know about that, and you didn't say anything yourself; now I've snatched the business of a fellow tradesman, a thousand mistakes, all my fault! But what's done is done, there's no point saying anything, I'm sorry to you, I apologize!" Niu Bao's sister-in-law busily offered Da San a seat and poured water, while Niu Bao leaned to one side, seething with anger. Yu Bao chuckled and said, "Uncle Da San, where are you coming from with this! Ask Grandpa Xi Lu! At that time, he said to let me do it, but I didn't agree. Tell me, am I capable enough? Uncle Da San, you, you, you mustn't say these things, I'm speaking from the bottom of my heart..." Da San didn't like to be verbose, and quickly interrupted, "Yu Bao! What's past is past, you do it after the autumn harvest! I'll apologize and beg!" After saying that, Da San walked outside, and Yu Bao hurriedly sent him off while stopping him and saying this and that. Niu Bao's sister-in-law also caught up in a few steps, shouting, "Grandpa Da San! You're a rare guest! How can a gust of wind blow you in, and another gust of wind blow you away? Won't you even have a drink of water? This is really a neglect! Sit down and rest!" Da San didn't turn his head back, said "I'm not thirsty," and went straight out the door.
　　Here, Yu Bao and the woman returned to the kiln, and Niu Bao was stomping his feet and cursing: "Damn it! What kind of people haven't I seen? You pull this trick? Humph! If I don't kill you after the autumn harvest, I'm not human!" His sister-in-law stopped him and said, "He heard you!" Niu Bao said, "So what if he heard me? Can he bite my balls off?" Yu Bao said, "Hey! I've never seen someone like you! Come, come, come! Let's discuss it! Look, he's played this trick!" They discussed it again. Yu Bao and the woman said that Da San's move was fake, probably he heard some rumors and came to change his tune, but Niu Bao said that Da San was scared and came to beg for mercy; however, no matter what, they felt that this time their hatred with Da San was clear, and it seemed that winning him over was impossible, so they decided not to pay attention to Da San, and see what happens, if he wants to fight or make trouble, they'll go all out. Niu Bao especially agreed with this point, and he seemed like he was about to fight someone at that moment, tightening his fist and saying, "Damn it, let's fight! Can he bite my balls off?" Which caused the two people next to him to busy themselves with persuading him to stop.
　　After Da San came out of Niu Bao's house, he kept looking for Xi Lu, and said to his face, "Last year, did you agree to let Yu Bao be the foreman?" Xi Lu saw that he had a stern face, and his big eyes were bulging round like a tiger, unlike his usual self, and couldn't help but be startled, and quickly said, "What are you saying this for now?" Da San said, "We are fellow tradesmen and don't snatch business, others can snatch mine, but I can't offend them. Look, now you've made me offend someone!" Xi Lu said, "What are you talking about? I pay to hire people, I can hire whoever I want! Besides, I didn't agree with him last year; even if I did, I can talk to him, how can you bring this up out of nowhere? Did something happen?" Da San said, "I don't know if something happened, but anyway, this isn't right, I can't feel at ease. Yu Bao can do it after the autumn harvest!" Xi Lu got anxious and hurriedly pulled him to sit down, bringing out a whole lot of reasons to persuade him, saying that your skills are strong, you spend less money, save more labor, Yu Bao certainly won't bear it in mind... But Da San couldn't listen to a word, and left without settling the matter.
　　From then on, Da San was unhappy about this matter all day long. He had long forgotten about the matchmaking, and didn't care about that anymore. Now, when he saw people, he only said that he had snatched someone else's business and made a mistake; that Yu Bao had argued with him twice and chased him away; that he would definitely let Yu Bao do it after the autumn harvest... He was truly sincere. But Yu Bao, seeing him like this, thought he was being disingenuous, covering up his embarrassment, and trying to please others, so he hated him even more. The people around him, not knowing that Yu Bao hated him, all said that this matter was nothing, and advised him to continue, especially some honest kiln workers, who even came to his door and said to him: "You must never leave! This kiln is about to become our rice bowl! Can you just throw it away?" Liu Gou's family also said, "You can't even tolerate a needle-sized thing? Are you even a man?" But those who knew that Yu Bao hated him didn't say anything, and Xiao Yanggui just advised him a few words in a lukewarm manner. This situation made Da San feel even more suffocated.
　　Only Shuan Cheng was like him, also uneasy. Once, when the two of them were working in the fields, they met again, and Shuan Cheng said to Da San, "Look, just one word from me has made you so restless, this is really my fault!" Da San sighed, "Little brother..." Shuan Cheng hurriedly said, "Uncle Da San! I'm your nephew..." Da San also interrupted, "Let's not talk about that! Our two hearts are together, aren't we like brothers? Little brother! You're right! Otherwise, I would never have known about this, and I would have done something wrong forever!" Shuan Cheng said, "It's not like that! I guess something is bound to happen because of this! In this world, a straight heart and eyes always seem to fail to do things well!" Da San stared blankly at Shuan Cheng for a while, and couldn't help but sigh, "Alas! Little brother, do you know these things at such a young age? That's right, the world is just like that. Alas!" Shuan Cheng said, "Uncle Da San! I think you suffer from this straight-in-straight-out fault! I'm always worried that you won't be able to stay in the village!" Shuan Cheng seemed to have heard some things that were unfavorable to Da San, and also sighed for a while; Da San said, "That's nothing, if I can't stay, I'll leave! But I know that I'll suffer from having a straight heart, but I always have this kind of energy, and it'll be the same when I go out! I think I'm going to die because of this! But I'm not willing to die like this! Alas! Damn it, this world is really..."
　　Shuan Cheng felt uncomfortable and wanted to change the subject, but couldn't think of how to change it; he wanted to advise Da San, but had nothing to say. He looked up and saw that the sun was almost overhead, and it was getting hot; he looked down again, and today neither of them had done much work yet! He looked at Da San again, Da San was lying on the ground, looking at the patch of sky above his head, not moving at all, so he started hoeing the ground himself. But after he had hoed a piece of land, Da San still hadn't gotten up, and when he looked closely, he wasn't asleep; Shuan Cheng suddenly thought of Da San's behavior, and couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness in his heart, so he didn't call Da San, picked up the hoe, and hoed the ground for Da San.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义　（１５）
    康濯
    十四　辞工
    大三回村就找玉宝，却找不见，后来人们指点给他，他才从牛宝家寻见。
    当时玉宝正跟牛宝和牛宝他嫂在计议对付大窑的办法，而且正在盘算怎么对付大三；玉宝觉得还应该想想法，看能跟大三拉拢靠近不，牛宝却下死劲反对。这工夫，大三去了，他们不觉一个个脸发红眼发傻，开不得口。大三却见面就道：“玉宝！去年喜禄约了你当领事开窑，这事我可实是不知，你自己也没有说；这下子我抢了同行把式的营生，千错万错我的错！可生米煮成了熟饭，没说的，我对不起你，我给你赔礼！”这边牛宝他嫂忙着给大三让坐倒水，牛宝却靠到一边发恨去了，玉宝嘻嘻笑着道：“大三爷，你看你这是从哪里说起！你问喜禄爷吧！那工夫他说叫我干，我就没应承的，你说，凭我这两下子就行么？大三爷，你你你可不敢说这些，我凭良心……”大三不爱噜嗦，忙抢着道：“玉宝！过去的拉倒，秋后你干吧！我赔情下礼就是！”说完，大三就往外走，玉宝忙一边送一边拦住他说这说那，牛宝他嫂也几步赶上，哇啦着道：“大三爷爷！你可是轻易不来的客人呀！怎么一阵风刚一刮来，又一阵风刮走啦？你连个水也不喝？这可真是怠慢啦！你坐下歇歇吧！”大三头也不回，说了声“我不渴”，就一直出门走了。
    这里玉宝跟女人走回窑，牛宝正跺着脚在骂：“＠他妈的！老子什么人没见过？你来这一手？哼！秋后不制死你老子不算人养的！”他嫂止住他道：“人家听见啦！”牛宝道：“听见啦又怎么着？他能咬了我个球？”玉宝道：“嗨！没见过你这人！来来来！商议商议吧！这不是，人家玩了这么一着！”他们又商议起来。玉宝跟女人说大三这一手是假的，怕是听了什么风声来转湾的，牛宝却说大三是害了怕来讨饶的；不过，不管怎么，他们却觉得这一下跟大三的仇气摆明了，拉拢靠近怕是不行了，因此便决定不搭理大三这回事，走着瞧着，要打要闹就豁出去干它一场。牛宝更是格外赞同这一点，他当时就象要跟人干一般，勒着拳头道：“＠他妈的干吧！他能咬了我个球？”惹得旁边二人又只得忙忙劝住他。
    再说大三从牛宝家出来以后，又一直找着喜禄，劈面就道：“你去年是说妥了叫玉宝当领事的么？”喜禄见他板着个脸，两只大眼鼓得圆虎虎地，不象平常情景，不免吃了一惊，忙道：“这会你说这作啥？”大三道：“咱们是同行把式不抢营生，人家能抢我的，我不能得罪人家。你看，这如今你却让我硬得罪了人！”喜禄道：“这说哪里话？我出钱请人，爱请谁请谁呗！再说，去年我也并没跟他说妥；就是说妥了吧，我跟他也好说嘛，你怎么凭空又说起这？莫非出了什么事？”大三说：“有事没事我不知道，反正这不合适，我安不下心。秋后玉宝干吧！”喜禄急了，忙拉他坐下，搬出满篇道理打劝他，说什么你把式强啦、花钱少省工大啦、玉宝保险不结记啦……大三却一句也听不进，没闹出个结果就走了。
    从此大三就为这事整日不痛快。他说亲的事早忘了，也不结记那了，这会见了人就只说他抢了人家的营生，闹了个错；说玉宝跟他嚷过两回，也赶他的过；说他秋后一定让给玉宝干……他真个是实心实意。但玉宝见他这样，心中却说他是心虚，是给自己遮丑，是讨好人家，因此就更恨了他。旁边的人们，不知道玉宝恨他的，倒都说这事没什么，劝他干下去，特别是有些老实窑黑，更找上门对他说：“你可千万不能走！这窑眼看成了咱们的饭碗子哩！你能一摔手就撂了？”柳沟家还说：“针眼大的事，你也容不下？你还算个男子汉？”可是，知道玉宝恨他的，就不说什么，小洋鬼也只是不冷不热地打劝他两句。这样的情景，更叫大三别闷得不行。
    只有拴成跟他一样，也是放心不下。有一回，他二人上地时又碰到一块，拴成就对大三说：“你看，我一句话就闹得你这么行坐不安的，这可是我的不对！”大三叹息道：“小兄弟……”拴成忙道：“大三叔！我可是你侄儿……”大三也抢着道：“咱不说那些！咱两人心碰了心，不就弟兄一样？小兄弟！你说得对！要不，我永世也不知道这事，可就闹下个永世对不起人家！”拴成道：“不是这么说！你这么一来，我猜想准得出事哩！这世道，直心直眼总象办不好事！”大三呆呆地望了拴成一阵，不觉叹息道：“唉！小兄弟，你这么不大点年岁，就知道这些么？不错，世道就是那么回事。唉！”拴成道：“大三叔！我看你就吃这直出直入的亏！我总担心你在村里呆不好的！”拴成好象风闻了一些对大三不利的事情，也叹息了一阵；大三道：“那倒没什么，呆不好我走呗！可我这人明知直心眼吃亏，却总是这么股劲，出去了也是这样！我看我准要死在这上头的！可我又不甘心这么死！唉！＠他妈这世道真是……”
    拴成难受起来，想把话岔开，却想不出怎么岔开；想打劝大三两句，也没话说。他抬头看看，太阳快当顶，热起来了；他又低头望望，今天他二人都还没做出多少活哩！他又看看大三，大三躺在地下，眼望着头顶那块天，一动也不动，他就自己先动弹开锄地了。但等他锄完了一块地，大三还没起来，仔细瞧瞧，却又没睡着；拴成忽地想起大三这人的所作所为，不禁心头酸酸地，就没叫大三，拿上锄，给大三锄开了地。
