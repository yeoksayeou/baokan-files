【Beijing News】The announcement of the responsible personnel of various departments of the government appointed by the Third Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee has aroused enthusiastic cheers and sincere support among teachers and students of Tsinghua University. Professor Pan Guangdan of the Department of Sociology of the university said: The various departments of the Central People's Government have gathered talents from all fields, and the extent of breadth is unprecedented; this also reflects the success of the consultative approach. At the same time, the establishment of committees between the institutes and ministries can achieve the grand effect of collective wisdom. Professor Zhou Peiyuan, Dean of Studies, said: The publication of this list is even more sufficient to show that the Common Program of the CPPCC is by no means an empty check. A new China that is independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous will soon be established under the leadership of such a strong Central People's Government.

【Our Newspaper】After the Central People's Government Committee appointed the responsible personnel of various government departments and the list was announced, the teachers, students, and staff of the Normal University unanimously expressed satisfaction and considered the selection of personnel appropriate. In order to have a deeper understanding of the personnel arrangements, the correspondence group specially visited Professors Hou Wailu and Guo Dali. Regarding the personnel arrangements, Professor Hou said: "Under the principle of the united front, today's government is formed. The selection of personnel has been carefully considered. First, various parties exchanged opinions and discussions, and then sent it to the government for review. It took three full weeks of consideration to successfully complete it. From the Common Program and the Organic Law of the People's Government, it can be understood that our personnel selection is responsible to the people, completely based on the spirit of the Common Program and the principle of the united front, proceeding from practical needs. From this, we can see the spirit of seeking truth from facts and the leadership's adherence to principles and impartiality of the Communist Party." Professor Guo Dali put forward an optimistic vision for the economic aspect, he said: "From the breadth of this government structure, the strength of the organization, and the appropriateness of the personnel allocation, this is unprecedented. In particular, the various departments under the Financial and Economic Committee are comprehensive, providing a strong guarantee for the economic construction of the New Democracy. Many experts are gathered in departments such as the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, and the Ministry of Fuel Industry. Although the difficulties of construction are not absent, the comprador class of imperialism and the feudal remnants may conspire to sabotage, but under the leadership of the Communist Party, the difficulties will surely be overcome."
