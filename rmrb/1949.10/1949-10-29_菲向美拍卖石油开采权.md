Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 23rd (TASS dispatch) – According to a statement by Andres, Director of the Philippine Bureau of Mines, the Philippine government is providing American oil monopolies with unlimited opportunities to explore and develop all oil resources on the Philippine Islands. In an interview with the Associated Press correspondent in Manila, Andres stated that the new Philippine law governing oil production grants Americans privileges even greater than those they can obtain in the United States. The law stipulates that Americans and Filipinos enjoy equal oil development rights and provides that all equipment, machinery, raw materials, and inventories imported by them within the first five years shall be exempt from tariffs, and oil exports shall also be tax-free.

　　菲向美拍卖石油开采权
    【新华社北京二十四日电】塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：据菲律宾矿业管理处处长安德里斯发表的谈话，菲律宾政府正供给美国石油独占资本以无限的机会，以探测和开发菲岛的一切油源。安德里斯在接见美联社驻马尼拉记者时说，菲律宾管理石油生产的新法令，给予美国人的特权，比美国人在美国所能得到的还要大。该法令规定美国人和菲律宾人享有平等的石油开发权，并规定在最初五年内，他们输入的一切装备、机器、原料及存货，均免缴关税，石油输出，也将免税。
