　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 6th. *Ren Dao Bao* in Paris published on the 4th telegrams from people's organizations including the French Communist Party Seine Regional Committee (including the city of Paris), the French Anti-German Guerrilla Comrades Association, the National Association of Veterans and War Victims, and the French People's Mutual Aid Association, congratulating the Government of the People's Republic of China, and unanimously demanding that the French government promptly establish diplomatic relations with the Government of the People's Republic of China.
　　The telegram from the Seine Regional Committee of the French Communist Party pointed out: The founding of the People's Republic of China confirms that nearly 500 million heroic Chinese people have embarked on the road to the democratic and peaceful camp. It said: "The recognition of New China by the great socialist countries of Lenin and Stalin is an extremely important event internationally, and this move decisively strengthens the peace camp." The telegram also said: "The people of Paris are deeply dissatisfied that the French government has not taken the same steps to immediately recognize the People's Republic of China, and will conduct all activities to that end."
　　The telegram from the French Anti-German Guerrilla Comrades Association deeply respects the heroic Chinese soldiers and civilians, and they "congratulate New China and its leader Mao Zedong, and wish to see the French government establish normal relations with New China as soon as possible." The National Association of Veterans and War Victims, representing 220,000 members, expressed warm respect for the establishment of the Chinese people's own government, and said: "Those whose skin bears the painful marks of two world wars regard this great event as a significant failure of the warmongers' plans." The French People's Mutual Aid Association said in an open letter to Chairman Mao: "We hope to see the French government promptly recognize your government, which is the sole organ of power generated by the will of all your people, and we will mobilize all members to work towards this goal."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th. According to TASS, Paris: The French people hail the founding of the People's Republic of China and the formation of its government. The Seine Provincial Branch of the French Communist Party expressed the sentiments of the people of Paris. They believe that this declaration brings the 475 million heroic people of China into the democratic and peaceful camp and ends the enslavement of China by Anglo-American imperialism. The recognition of the Central People's Government of China by the socialist countries – the countries of Lenin and Stalin – is an action of great international significance, which definitively strengthens the peace camp. The people of Paris regret that the French government has not taken this decision. The Republican Association of Veterans stated that as the soul of the glorious war against the Japanese aggressors – the Chinese People's Liberation Army – completes its victory over the American imperialist agents centered on Chiang Kai-shek, the Republican Association of Veterans and its friends congratulate the Chinese Communist Party and its army. Members of the French Resistance, who have witnessed the program of the French National Resistance Committee being betrayed, are delighted to point out that the heroic struggle of the Chinese people has finally led to the founding of a new democratic state of the people, which will forever be loyal to the goals of the Chinese people's struggle. They congratulate the Chinese People's Government and its leader Mao Zedong, and hope that the French government will quickly establish normal relations with the Chinese People's Government. They are pleased to point out that international warmongers have now lost one of their main tools in China. They also rejoice at the entry of this great power, China, into the peace camp. The Republican Association of Veterans and War Victims, representing 220,000 members and sympathizers, warmly congratulates the birth of the People's Republic of China. Those who bear serious scars from the past two world wars see in this outstanding event the complete failure of the warmongers' plans. They know that the birth of this new republic is a major victory for the forces of peace and democracy. The French People's Relief Association sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong saying: Democratic people united in the People's Relief Association warmly welcome the founding of the People's Republic of China, which has opened an era of freedom for the Chinese people and ended the terror and oppression of the Kuomintang leaders. The People's Relief Association hopes that the French government will quickly recognize your government, because it is the only regime that expresses the wishes of all your people. The People's Relief Association also calls on all members to support this demand.
