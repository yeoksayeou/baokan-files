　　Xinhua News Agency, Hami, 24th. Nearly 10,000 soldiers and civilians in Hami held a grand rally in the northern suburbs on the afternoon of the 19th to celebrate the entry of the People's Liberation Army into Xinjiang. The venue was decorated with colorful arches and large banners with slogans such as "Long Live the People's Liberation Army" and "Long Live the Liberation of All Ethnic Groups in Xinjiang." The five-star national flag fluttered in the wind, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. When the newly equipped and fully armed PLA infantry, teams of artillery, and huge tank units entered the venue, people of all ethnic groups cheered enthusiastically. In addition to the People's Liberation Army and people of all ethnic groups in Hami, the conference was also attended by more than twenty units, including the 178th Brigade of the 78th Division of the Kuomintang army who revolted. Guo Peng, commander of a certain army of the People's Liberation Army, spoke amidst thunderous applause. He said: Today's celebration indicates that the people of Hami have begun to be free and have turned over a new leaf. The reason why Xinjiang can be peacefully liberated is due to the strong power of the Liberation Army, the basic victory of the Chinese people's revolution throughout the country, and the result of General Tao Zhiyue and Mr. Burhan of Xinjiang agreeing to and accepting a peaceful solution. Then, he elaborated that the political task of the Liberation Army entering Xinjiang is to unite the people of all ethnic groups to protect peace and assist the people of all ethnic groups to jointly build a new Xinjiang. Wang Enmao, political commissar of a certain army, pointed out in his speech: The glorious uprising of the Xinjiang troops and the peaceful entry of the Liberation Army into Xinjiang is what all the people hope for and welcome. The People's Liberation Army will surely shoulder the task of protecting the lives and property of all the people. Then, Political Commissar Wang Enmao instructed the revolting troops on the direction of their future efforts, stating that they should loyally protect the interests of the people, safeguard the peace the people have gained, protect the lives and property of all the people, stabilize order, and expose and stop the criminal acts of a few saboteurs. The revolting troops themselves must carry out active transformation and education so that they can truly become a force serving the people. Sarakhayong, a representative of the Kazakh ethnic group, said in his speech that he was very excited that the Kazakh people were able to send representatives to participate in this grand meeting, and expressed his heartfelt respect to the People's Liberation Army on behalf of the Kazakh people. Ai Luo, the former Kuomintang commissioner of the Hami District, and Ai Manda Ahong, a representative of the Uyghur ethnic group, spoke successively, unanimously stating that with the Liberation Army coming to Xinjiang, the freedom of all ethnic groups can be guaranteed. Mo Woruo, commander of the 78th Division of the revolting troops, said firmly in his speech that he is willing to study hard under the banner of Chairman Mao, strive for progress, and make the revolting troops an armed force serving the people.
