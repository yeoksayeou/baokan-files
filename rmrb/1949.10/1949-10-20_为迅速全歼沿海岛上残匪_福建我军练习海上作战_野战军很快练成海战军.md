Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 19th: In order to swiftly and completely annihilate the remnant bandit troops entrenched on the coastal islands, the People's Liberation Army units on the Fujian front have been diligently practicing amphibious warfare since arriving in the coastal areas. After the battles to clear out the outer remnant bandit strongholds of Jinmen and Xiamen, the naval combat tactics and techniques of the PLA units have been greatly improved. After the establishment of the Central People's Government and the order from Commander-in-Chief Zhu De on October 1st to continue advancing and annihilating the enemy reached them, all the commanders and soldiers became even more motivated and expressed their determination to perform meritorious service in the battle to liberate Xiamen. Wu Qunhua, a soldier from a certain unit's "Model Company for Crossing the River," said: "Chairman Mao is now in charge of the country, we must quickly master our skills, fight a beautiful battle, and celebrate."

A certain unit's "Model Company for Crossing the River" did not have a single straggler during the march of over 200 li on the north shore of Xiamen. After arriving at each campsite, they would urge each other to practice naval warfare, preparing to perform meritorious deeds across the sea at any time. Every day on the beaches, in the fields, and in the valleys, before dawn, there was a chorus of bugle calls for amphibious landing practice, shouts of charging, and the loud noise of simulated explosions. The Second Battalion of a certain regiment was only two li across the sea from the enemy. Under the harassment of enemy planes, warships, and artillery, they repeatedly practiced combat maneuvers such as demolishing and passing through barbed wire after landing. The soldiers said: "Only by training like this can we defeat the enemy." To cherish and take care of the civilian laborers on the boats, the commanders and soldiers proposed that the soldiers themselves undertake the task of rowing during assault operations. Therefore, everyone practiced rowing at sea day and night, rain or shine. Whenever dusk approached and the remnant bandits in Xiamen blindly fired their cannons to embolden themselves, the PLA soldiers cheered and competed to practice rowing and naval combat. Soldiers of a certain regiment learned to steer, identify wind direction, and orientation within a week, and created new boat handling tools, greatly increasing the speed of the boats at sea. The soldiers proudly said: "Now we are not only a field army, but also a naval army." When practicing naval operations, the artillerymen learned how to calculate hits on moving targets and the techniques of navigating boats in stormy seas. In order to move ships away from enemy fire, a certain unit moved them from the east side of Jimei Peninsula to the west side, using manpower to drag many ships across four or five li of land in two days and nights. Soldiers dragged large wooden boats one by one from the East Sea Bay onto the land in the wind and rain, then pulled the landing craft across the road, across uneven fields, and the small hills of the peninsula. The West Sea Bay, which originally had no boats in sight, was transformed into a dense shipyard of wooden boats after two nights and one day. The people's soldiers thus used their brains and physical strength to overcome difficulties, create miracles, and prepare for an important assault, and went on to conquer the enemy, liberate Xiamen, and achieve a great victory.

### 为迅速全歼沿海岛上残匪　福建我军练习海上作战  野战军很快练成海战军

　　为迅速全歼沿海岛上残匪
  　福建我军练习海上作战
    野战军很快练成海战军
    【新华社福建前线十九日电】福建前线人民解放军为迅速全歼盘据沿海岛上的残余匪军，各部在进抵沿海地区后都曾紧张地练习渡海作战。肃清金门、厦门的外围残匪据点的战斗结束后，解放军各部海上作战的战术技术都大大地提高了一步。当中央人民政府成立，朱德总司令十月一日继续进军歼敌命令传到后，全体指战员斗志益为奋发，纷纷表示坚决要在解放厦门的战斗中立功。某部渡江作战模范连战士吴群华说：“毛主席当了家，我们要赶快练好本领，打个漂亮仗，来庆贺庆贺。”
    某部“渡江作战模范连”在厦门北岸二百多里行军中没有一个人掉队，每到宿营地后，大家即互相督促练习海上作战，准备随时跨海立战功。每天在海滩上，田野里，山谷中，不到拂晓就响起一片渡海登陆练习的军号声、冲锋呐喊声，和演习爆炸的巨响。某团二营与敌只隔海面二里路，在敌飞机、军舰、大炮袭扰下，反复练习渡海登陆后拆毁和通过铁丝网的战斗动作。战士们说：“只有这样锻炼，我们才能打败敌人。”为爱护与照顾船上民工，指战员们提出在突击作战时由战士们自己担任划船任务，因此大家又不分昼夜阴晴地在海上演习划船。每当暮色朦胧、厦门残匪正盲目鸣炮替自己壮胆时，解放军的战士们就欢声四起，竞相练习划船和水上作战。某团战士们在一星期内便学会了掌舵，识别风向，方向，并创造了新的行船工具，使船在海上的行驶速度大大提高。战士们都骄傲地说：“现在我们不但是野战军，而且是海战军了。”炮兵们在练习海上作战时学会了打活动目标的计算法，和惊风巨浪中驶船的技术。某部为将船只避开敌人火力，从集美半岛东面移到西面，用人力将许多船在一天两夜中，拖过四五里陆地。战士们在风雨中将一只只的大木船，从东海湾拖上陆地，然后把登陆的船拉过公路，拉过高低不平的田野和半岛的小山坡。原来不见一只船影的西海湾，经过两夜一昼，立刻变了一个木舟密集的船坞了。人民的战士就这样用他们的脑力和体力，征服了困难，创造了奇迹，作好突击的重要准备工作；并进而征服了敌人，解放了厦门，获得了巨大的胜利。
