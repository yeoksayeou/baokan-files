    China's Internal Affairs Should Be Handled by the Chinese People
  　 The UN General Assembly Has No Right to Interfere
    The Soviet Union Firmly Opposes Inclusion on the Agenda
    The bankrupt rulers of old China are attempting to use this issue to oppose the Soviet Union, to oppose the Soviet Union's unwavering efforts to consolidate international cooperation within and outside the United Nations. This tactic does not contribute to the consolidation of the United Nations organization in the slightest. On the contrary, accepting the Kuomintang government delegation's slanderous accusations will mean directly encouraging the reactionaries' provocative attacks on the Soviet Union. The Steering Committee must reject the Kuomintang government's unfounded, slanderous, and provocative deceptive schemes.
    Although the chairman asked the committee members to speak, none of the representatives of the US-British bloc spoke. The representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and Canada remained silent, while the Kuomintang's deceptive schemes were only possible because they were backing them behind the scenes. Only the Greek representative said that he supported the issues raised by the Kuomintang representative.
    The Polish representative, Mr. Raczkowski, pointed out that the accusations made by the Kuomintang representative were unfounded, and said that the situation in China was China's internal affair. The Polish representative stated that he supported the Soviet delegation's proposal not to include the Kuomintang government delegation's accusations on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly.
    Then, the US-British voting machine went into action again. Following the United States and Britain, several other representatives on the Steering Committee obediently raised their hands. The Soviet and Polish delegations opposed the inclusion of this issue on the agenda. Vyshinsky drew the attention of the chairman of the committee to the fact that, as the results of the vote proved, not all members participated in the vote. In fact, only thirteen members participated in the vote, while a total of fifteen people attended the meeting, including the new member - the chairman of the Special Political Committee.
    The Soviet delegation did not participate in the vote on the question of which committee to refer the Kuomintang's deceptive scheme to.

### 中国内政应由中国人民处理　 联大无权干涉  苏联坚决反对列入议程

    中国内政应由中国人民处理
  　 联大无权干涉
    苏联坚决反对列入议程
    旧中国破了产的统治者，企图利用这一问题以反对苏联，反对苏联始终不渝的在联合国内外巩固国际合作的努力。这种手段对于巩固联合国组织丝毫没有贡献。相反地，接受国民党政府代表团的毁谤控诉，将意味着直接鼓励反动派对苏联的挑衅性的攻击。指导委员会必须否决国民党政府的无根据的毁谤的和挑衅的欺骗勾当。
    虽然主席要求各委员发言，但是，美英集团的代表没有人发言。美英法加的代表都保持缄默，而国民党欺骗勾当之所以可能出现，却是由于它们在后台撑腰的缘故。只有希腊代表说，他支持国民党代表所提出的问题。
    波兰代表拉齐斯指出，国民党代表所提出的控诉，是毫无证据的；并且说，中国的局势是中国人民的内政。波兰代表声称，他支持苏联代表团的提议，不把国民党政府代表团的控诉列入联合国大会的议程。
    于是，美英表决机器又动作起来了。追随在美国和英国的后面，指导委员会有其他几名代表驯服地举了手。苏联和波兰代表团反对将这一问题列入议程。维辛斯基提起委员会的主席注意这一事实，正如表决的结果所证明的，并不是全体委员都参加了表决。事实上，只有十三名委员参加了表决，而连新委员——特别政治委员会的主席——在内，出席会议的共有十五人。
    苏联代表团关于国民党这一欺骗勾当交付那一个委员会处理的问题，没有参加表决。
