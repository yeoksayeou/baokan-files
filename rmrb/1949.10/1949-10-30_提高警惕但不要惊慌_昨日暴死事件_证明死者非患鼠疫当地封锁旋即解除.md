　　Increase Vigilance But Do Not Panic
　　Yesterday's Sudden Death Incident
　　Proved the Deceased Did Not Have Plague, Local Blockade Immediately Lifted
　　[Reported by This Newspaper] A sudden death incident was discovered in Beijing yesterday (the 29th). The deceased fell ill at 3:00 AM and died at 10:00 AM. After examination by the First Health District Office of the Municipal Health Bureau and autopsy by Peking Union Medical College Hospital, it was proven that the person did not die from plague. The reporter interviewed Hu Zhengxiang, the head of the Pathology Department of Peking Union Medical College, about this matter. He said: The deceased had a swollen gland in front of his chest and adrenal atrophy. People with this kind of physique often die from minor illnesses or even injections. This disease is called thymic lymphatic constitution, which Peking Union Medical College Hospital experienced many years ago. Based on the following three phenomena, it can be determined that it is definitely not plague: 1. The deceased's lungs were normal; 2. The lymph nodes showed no swelling or hemorrhage; 3. No plague bacillus was found on smears of lymph nodes and lung fluid.
　　The deceased was named Hou Yanfu, a 15-year-old boy, a student at Fushu School, whose father worked for the Ministry of Railways and lived at No. 9 Chunshu Hutong. He was usually in good health, but had a hoarse voice and short breath since he was a child. He returned home from school at 7:00 PM on the 28th, studied at home after dinner, and went to bed at 9:00 PM. At 3:00 AM on the 29th, he began to feel unwell. He vomited once after urinating, throwing up a large bowl of undigested food he had eaten the night before, slightly tinged with red. After that, he fell into a coma and did not speak, and his breathing became rapid. Around 8:00 AM, he had shortness of breath, and a Chinese medicine doctor diagnosed him and used acupuncture. He was given Chinese medicine at 9:00 AM. Around 10:00 AM, a doctor from the Ministry of Railways arrived, but he died before he could be treated. Fearing it was plague, the Ministry of Railways sent people to seal off the area. The First District Health Office immediately went to examine it, and after it was taken to Peking Union Medical College for autopsy and proved not to be plague, the blockade was lifted.
　　With the plague currently prevalent in Chahar Province, it is perfectly correct for the relevant authorities and the general public in Beijing to increase vigilance and report to the health authorities immediately when they are sick, just like the handling of this matter today; but by no means should we panic and lose our heads. All relevant authorities and citizens of the city, especially the public security agencies, should report all suspected illnesses to the Epidemic Prevention Committee as soon as possible, which will be of great help in protecting the health of the two million citizens.

　　提高警惕但不要惊慌　
    昨日暴死事件            
    证明死者非患鼠疫当地封锁旋即解除
    【本报讯】京市昨（二十九）日发现一暴死事件。死者于上午三时发病，延至十时死亡，经市卫生局第一卫生区事务所检验与协和医院尸体解剖结果，证明此人确非患鼠疫而致死。记者特为此事走访了协和医学校病理系主任胡正详，他说：死者胸前腺肿大，肾上腺萎缩，象他这种体质的人，往往因小病甚至扎针，就会引起死亡。此病病名叫胸腺淋巴体质，多年以前，协和医院曾经历过。根据下面三个现象，可以断定绝对不是鼠疫：一、死者肺部正常，二、淋巴腺无肿大或溢血现象，三、淋巴腺及肺液涂片上未发现鼠疫菌。
    死者名侯燕夫，十五岁之男孩，扶输学校学生，其父任职于铁道部，家住椿树胡同九号。平日身体尚称健康，惟自小就嗓音哑，呼吸较短。二十八日下午七时放学回家，晚饭后自习，直至九时睡觉。二十九日晨三时，开始不舒服，小便后呕吐一次，吐出一大碗昨晚吃下而未消化的食物，略带红色。其后则昏睡不语，呼吸较促。八时左右发生气喘，曾由中医诊断并用中医法扎针。九时灌下中药。十时左右铁道部医生来，还未诊治即死去。因恐系鼠疫，铁道部派人将该地封锁。第一区卫生事务所随即前往检验，后抬至协和解剖，证明不是鼠疫后，封锁已撤除。
    鼠疫正流行于察北的今天，本市有关机关及广大市民提高警惕，有病时即时向卫生机关报告是十分正确的，就象处理今天这一件事一样；但决不要因此惊慌失措。全市各有关机关及市民特别是治安机构今后应尽速将一切可疑的病症报告防疫委员会，对于保护二百万市民的健康，将有很大作用。
