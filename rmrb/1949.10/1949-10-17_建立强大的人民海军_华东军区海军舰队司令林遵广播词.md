　　Building a Strong People's Navy
  　Broadcast by Lin Zun, Commander of the East China Military Region Navy Fleet
    [Report from this newspaper] Lin Zun, Commander of the East China Military Region Navy Fleet of the People's Liberation Army, broadcast the following speech on Beijing Xinhua Broadcasting Station on the 15th of this month:
    Fellow countrymen!
    Let me talk today about building a strong People's Navy.
    Fellow countrymen! China is a continental country, and also a maritime country. She not only has a very long land border, but also a very long coastline. From the mouth of the Yalu River in the north to Bai'e River in the south, including the Bohai Sea, the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, the South China Sea, and more than three thousand islands along the coast, the coastline is more than eight thousand five hundred nautical miles. Therefore, we must build a strong navy sufficient to defend our territorial waters.
    Fellow countrymen! Our ancestors knew how to build and use ships very early on. During the Tang and Song Dynasties, our ships were already traveling to and from various countries in the South China Sea. By the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, the eunuch Zheng He made seven voyages to the West, and our maritime industry became even more developed. This proves that our nation is a very good seafaring nation; but since then, China's maritime industry has gradually declined. What is the reason for this? It's very simple. Because the emperors of the feudal era, the Northern Warlords, and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, the running dog of American imperialism, oppressed the people internally and were unable to resist imperialist aggression externally. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang and others even completely relied on imperialism, turning China into a semi-colony, and industry could not be developed. Therefore, it was impossible for them to build a navy. Now the situation is completely different. The People's Republic of China has been born, the regime belongs to the people, and the People's Navy has become an important force for safeguarding the interests of the people. The people and the people's government must build a strong navy. With the end of the revolutionary war, an upsurge of economic construction will appear in our country, which is the material basis for building a strong People's Navy. The Chinese people have stood up, China's industry will be developed, China's national defense will be consolidated, and China's strong People's Navy must also be built.
    Young friends! China has such a long coastline, and the maritime industry is very great. The navy stands on the forefront of national defense, the navy's responsibility is heavy, and the navy's mission is glorious. We welcome all patriotic young people to stand on the forefront of the motherland and enthusiastically join the People's Navy.
    Navy friends oppressed by the Kuomintang remnant bandits! New China has been born, and the demise of Chiang Kai-shek and Gui Yongqing is already doomed, which is very obvious. The People's Navy of New China is being built, and only the People's New China can build a strong new navy, which is also very obvious. Chiang Kai-shek and Gui Yongqing have reached the time of their death. Do you still want to go to the grave with them? Do you still want to be their slaves again? At this time, you need great courage. Don't lose your last chance. You should bravely turn to the people's side. The People's Government and the People's Liberation Army have a lenient attitude towards you. If you become aware, Shanghai, Qingdao, and many other ports are waiting for you, welcoming you to serve the People's Navy and serve the people. This is also what we deeply hope from you.

### 建立强大的人民海军　华东军区海军舰队司令林遵广播词

　　建立强大的人民海军
  　华东军区海军舰队司令林遵广播词
    【本报讯】人民解放军华东军区海军舰队司令林遵本月十五日在北京新华广播电台的广播词，全文如下：全国同胞们：
    让我今天来谈一谈关于建设一个强大的人民海军问题吧。
    同胞们！中国是一个大陆的国家，也是一个海洋的国家。她不仅有很长的陆地边界，还有很长的海岸线。北从鸭绿江口起，南至白＠河止，包括渤海，黄河，东海，南海，以及沿海三千多个的岛屿，这海岸线一共是八千五百余海哩。因此我们必须建立一个足够保卫我们领海的强大的海军。
    同胞们！我们的祖先很早就会造船和用船，唐宋的时候，我们的船只，已经和南海各国往来，到了明朝永乐年间，三保太监郑和七次下西洋，我们的海洋事业就更加发达了。这证明我们的民族是很优良的航海民族；但是自此以后中国的海洋事业，就渐渐衰微了，这是什么原因呢？说起来也很简单，因为封建时代的皇帝，北洋军阀以及美帝国主义走狗蒋介石反动集团，对内压迫人民，对外无法抵抗帝国主义的侵略，甚至如蒋介石匪帮等，完全投靠帝国主义，使中国变成了半殖民地，工业得不到发展，因此他们是不可能把海军建立起来的。现在情形可就完全不同了，中华人民共和国已经诞生，政权属于人民，人民的海军已成为保卫人民利益的重要武力，人民和人民的政府一定要建立一个强大的海军。随着革命战争的结束，我国将出现一个经济建设的高潮，这就是建设强大人民海军的物质基础。中国人民已经站立起来了，中国的工业将获得发展，中国的国防将获得巩固，中国强大的人民海军也一定要建立起来。
    年青朋友们！中国有这样长的海岸线，海洋事业是很伟大的，海军是站在国防的最前线，海军的责任是重大的，海军的任务是光荣的，我们欢迎各位爱国的青年们站在祖国的最前线，热烈地参加人民的海军。
    被国民党残余匪帮所压迫的海军朋友们！新中国已经诞生，蒋介石桂永清的灭亡，已经注定，这是很明显的。新中国的人民海军正在建立，也惟有人民的新中国，才能够建立一个强大的新海军，这也是很明显的。蒋介石桂永清已经到了死亡的时候，难道你们还跟他下坟墓么？难道你们还愿意再做他们的奴隶么？这个时候你们需要很大的勇气，不要失去你们最后的机会吧，你们应该勇敢地投到人民方面来。人民政府和人民解放军对你们的态度是宽大的，如果你们觉悟起来，上海、青岛，以及许多其他的港口，都在等候着你们，欢迎你们来为人民海军服务，为人民服务，这也是我们所深切盼望于你们的。
