Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Dispatch:

	Rural work in Henan Province during August focused on suppressing scattered bandits and hidden bandits, combined with key anti-local tyrant activities and mobilizing the masses.

	At the end of July, a unit of the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army, in coordination with troops from the Henan Military Region and local armed forces from the Shanzhou, Luoyang, and Nanyang sub-districts, launched a large-scale military suppression campaign against large groups of bandits in Lingbao, Wenxiang, Lushi, Neixiang, Zhechuan, and other areas in western Henan. Subsequently, bandit gangs in various locations collapsed and disintegrated. In the Huangchuan sub-district of southern Henan, various groups of bandits, under the pressure of our strong military forces, fled to the mountainous areas along the Henan-Hubei border. By this point, the phase of encircling and suppressing large bandit groups in Henan had basically concluded. In early August, various locations transitioned to a new phase of suppressing scattered and hidden bandits. From late July to the end of August, with the active assistance of the masses, a total of over 27,000 bandits were eliminated. Rural order throughout the province has gradually become more stable.

	The anti-local tyrant movement among farmers in Henan Province had spread to over 20 counties by mid-August, with the work in the Xuchang sub-district progressing particularly well. The Xuchang sub-district is an advanced area for mass movements in Henan, where one-third of the region had experienced anti-local tyrant liquidation struggles last year and rent reduction and interest rate reduction movements this spring. In August, this part of the region further carried out a review movement, crushed the clandestine sabotage and conspiracies to restore power by local tyrants and landlords, and, in conjunction with the suppression of scattered bandits and opposition to special agents, rectified and consolidated farmers' organizations, laying the foundation for further social reforms in the future. The remaining two-thirds of the region focused on suppressing scattered bandits and opposing local tyrants, mobilizing the broad masses to struggle against the most heinous bandit leaders and local tyrants. In the struggle, farmers' associations were established or rectified to initially organize the masses. In addition, the Shangqiu, Zhengzhou, Chenliu, and other sub-districts focused on suppressing scattered bandits, combined with anti-local tyrant struggles. In general, work started with key villages and gradually expanded. Over the past month, various sub-districts have achieved significant results. For example, the Changshang Granary District of Kaifeng County first focused on Saojie Town (which has over four hundred and thirty households, divided into three administrative villages). Through bandit suppression and propaganda, more than thirty active farmers were cultivated, and then a mass meeting of more than two thousand people from four villages was convened to struggle against a local tyrant landlord who colluded with bandits to harm the people. After the struggle, the membership of the farmers' association expanded to over one hundred people. This victory quickly spread, inspiring the masses in more than twenty surrounding villages, among which fourteen villages quickly organized farmers' association groups to prepare for struggling against local tyrant elements.

	The summer grain requisition work in Henan Province had reached over 96% of the province's total task by early August, with Luoyang, Zhengzhou, and five other special districts completing 100% of their targets. The people's government's policy of reasonable burden was warmly supported by farmers in various regions. Many counties completed the work of storing grain in granaries within only about a week. Large quantities of new wheat are now being transported to the southern front. In order to expand the wheat planting area throughout the province, the Provincial People's Government loaned out 5 million jin of wheat seeds in late August to solve the seed difficulties of poor farmers.

	In August, the people of Henan Province engaged in intense struggles against floods, droughts, insect pests, and other disasters. The Xuchang sub-district suffered two floods in July and August, affecting over 70 villages, and some areas were also hit by locust plagues. The Chenliu sub-district also suffered severe disasters, with over 60,000 mu of land flooded in Zhongmu, Fugou, and other counties in August. Individual areas in Zhengzhou and Huangchuan suffered from drought, and red spider pests occurred in the cotton fields of Luoyang. These disasters have been basically overcome under the active leadership of the local people's governments. Especially after widespread heavy rains in Henan in early and mid-August, the People's Government immediately helped the masses in drought-stricken areas replant late autumn crops and vegetables, enabling farmers in various drought-stricken areas to plant in time. The autumn harvest is now underway in some areas, and a yield of 70% of a normal year is generally expected.

　　河南农村一月
    河南省八月份的农村工作，是以清剿散匪、潜匪，结合有重点的反恶霸和发动群众为中心。
    七月底，人民解放军第四野战军某部配合河南省军区部队及陕州、洛阳、南阳等分区地方武装，在豫西的灵宝、阌乡、卢氏、内乡、浙川等地，向大股土匪展开了大规模的军事清剿后，各地股匪相继溃散瓦解。在豫南的潢川分区，各股匪徒亦在我强大军事压力下，纷纷向豫鄂边境山区逃窜。至此，河南围剿股匪阶段即已基本上结束。八月上旬各地即转入清剿散匪、潜匪的新阶段。自七月下旬到八月底止，在群众的积极帮助下，共歼灭土匪达二万七千余名。全省农村秩序已渐趋安定。
    河南省农民的反恶霸运动，八月份中已在二十余县内普遍展开，其中以许昌分区的工作进行得较好。许昌分区是河南群众运动的先进地区，其中有三分之一的地区曾经过去年的反恶霸清算斗争和今春的减租减息运动。这部分地区在八月份中进一步开展了复查运动，粉碎了恶霸、地主当权派的暗中破坏和阴谋复辟活动，并结合清剿散匪和反对特务的工作，整顿和巩固了农民组织，为将来进一步的社会改革打下基础。其余三分之二的地区则以清剿散匪、反恶霸为重心，发动广大群众，向罪大恶极之匪首、恶霸作斗争，在斗争中建立或整顿农会组织，把农民群众初步组织起来。此外，商邱、郑州、陈留等分区，则以清剿散匪为主，结合反恶霸斗争。在进行时一般均先由重点村做起，逐步向面发展。一月来各分区都已获得不少成绩。如开封县厂上廪区首先以扫街镇（该镇有四百三十余户，分三个行政村）为重点，通过剿匪和宣传，培养了三十余农民积极分子，进而联合四个村召开了二千余人的群众大会，斗争了勾结土匪残害人民的恶霸地主。斗争结束后，农会会员扩大到一百多人。这个胜利消息迅速传播出去，鼓舞了周围二十余村的群众，其中十四个村迅速组织了农会小组，酝酿斗争恶霸分子。
    河南省的夏季征粮工作，至八月上旬即已完成全省总任务的百分之九十六以上，其中洛阳、郑州等五个专区均已百分之百地完成。人民政府的合理负担政策受到各地农民的热烈拥护。很多县仅在一个星期左右即全部完成屯粮入仓的工作。现大批新麦正源源运往江南前线。省人民政府为了扩大全省种麦面积，八月下旬又贷出麦种五百万斤，以解决贫苦农民种籽困难。
    八月份，河南省人民曾先后与水、旱、虫等灾害进行了紧张的斗争，许昌分区曾于七、八两月连遭两次水灾，受灾村庄达七十余个，部分地区又遭蝗蝻灾害。陈留分区灾情亦重，中牟、扶沟等县八月份中被淹土地达六万余亩。郑州、潢川个别地区遭受旱灾，洛阳棉田曾发生红蜘蛛害虫。这些灾害，在各地人民政府领导群众积极救治下，都已基本上克服了。特别在八月初旬和中旬河南普降透雨后，人民政府立即帮助旱灾地区群众补种晚秋和蔬菜，使遭受旱灾的各地农民得以及时下种。现部分地区已进行秋收，一般可望有七成年景。
