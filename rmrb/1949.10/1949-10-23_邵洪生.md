    Celebrating our
    New nation,
    New nation,
    Like a flower,
    Nurtured
    By the blood and sweat of heroes!
    --Song

    Fighting for a night and half a day,
    The battle is not yet over.

    The enemy retreated into the bunker,
    A fan-shaped web of fire covered the land,
    The terrain was open and impossible to ascend,
    The assault troops were very anxious.

    The instructor shouted in front of the team:
    Who will blow up the bunker?
    A soldier jumped out and roared:
    "I will complete this task!"

    Everyone saw it was Old Shao,
    His name was known to all;
    That day at the grievance meeting,
    Everyone was moved to tears by his story.

    Shao Hongsheng had a hard life,
    He never wore a piece of cloth since he was little,
    Always naked all day long.
    In winter, snowflakes fell,
    Hugging his arms and shivering.

    In the twelfth lunar month, water dripped and turned to frost,
    Herding cattle and sheep in the wilderness,
    His hands and feet were frostbitten.

    He went to the landlord to beg for a piece of clothing,
    Pleading bitterly, but he ignored him:
    Calling him "Master" once, he didn't respond,
    Calling him "Master" twice, his face changed,
    Cursing, "Damn you, stop pestering me,
    Freezing to death is just a stinking piece of land,
    I have money, I'll hire someone else."

    Beaten, scolded, and tormented,
    Half his life was spent in tears.

    At the grievance meeting, Old Shao explained clearly:
    "The suffering is given by the landlord,
    The suffering comes from Old Chiang,
    The landlord and Old Chiang are of the same root,
    If you pull out this root,
    The poor people will have a great liberation."

    Everyone knew that someone else had made a contribution in the first battle,
    Old Shao had been envious for a long time,

    Everyone knew that Old Shao had something on his mind!
    When the Party members went to the meeting,
    Old Shao felt uncomfortable;
    Why is it that other people also have one head and two hands,
    Why can't I?

    If I don't uproot this bunker this time,
    My revolution, Old Shao's, will be in vain!

    He unloaded all his guns and bullets,
    Tied his shoelaces tightly and fastened his belt,
    Hurriedly began to tie up the explosives,

    Striking a match to light the fuse,
    The wind blew a little red.

    Machine guns and rifles shouted in unison,
    Covering Old Shao as he delivered the explosives.

    Old Shao darted into the middle of the street,
    Crouching forward,
    With the wind beneath his feet.

    Stepping over the deer fence with a crash,
    Whizzing bullets rained down.

    Hand grenades were thrown out with a bang,
    The exploding sparks dazzled the eyes,
    Clumps of yellow earth turned upwards.
    Old Shao's heart was like iron,
    Old Shao's heart was like steel,
    Carrying the explosives, he charged upwards.

    Wa wa wa,
    The machine gun swept over,
    Old Shao didn't dodge.

    The explosives turned into a mountain,
    Heavily pressing on his shoulders,
    The foundation under his feet was broken,
    His body was unsteady.
    His eyes flashed with gold,
    He fell to the ground in a "lie xie" (東北土话, which means “fell askew”).

    The assault troops held their guns,
    Just waiting for the explosives to explode.

    Someone cried out in dismay,
    Could it be that Shao Hongsheng was killed by the enemy?

    They surrounded the instructor,
    Competing to light the fuse,
    Arms raised like a forest,
    The instructor didn't know who to send.

    Suddenly someone shouted:
    Comrade Old Shao is still alive!

    Shao Hongsheng was dazed and then regained consciousness,
    There was a big hole in his stomach,
    The bullet stirred and his stomach hurt,
    His whole body was stained red with blood.

    Clenching his teeth without making a sound,
    His feet desperately pushed backwards,
    His elbows propped up on the ground,
    Crawling up step by step.

    Crawling a bit, his head swayed,
    Crawling two bits, blood and sweat flowed all over the ground.

    What a fine soldier Shao Hongsheng!
    He crawled to the middle of the two gun holes,
    The explosives piled on top of the bunker.

    Gritting his teeth, he lit the fuse,
    He turned back after lighting the fuse.

    Behind him, boom,
    The bunker rose into the air!

    Bricks and stones flew up with waves of smoke,
    The bunker was uprooted!

    The instructor picked up Shao Hongsheng,
    Hearing him call out vaguely:
    My task is complete.

    After saying this,
    No response to thousands of calls.

    Since that day,
    Shao Hongsheng's heroic name has spread everywhere.
    Commemorating Shao Hongsheng,
    Mao Zedong's medal hangs in his home,
    The military region credited him with three major merits.

    Shao Hongsheng's name is written on the hero list,
    Shao Hongsheng's name has spread throughout towns and villages!

    ………………
    庆祝我们
    的新国家
    新国家，
    好象一朵花，
    英雄的血汗
    把她养育大！
    ——歌曲
　
    打了一夜零半天，
    战斗还没完。
　
    敌人缩进地堡里，
    扇形火网盖地皮，
    地势开阔上不去，
    突击部队好着急。
　
    指导员队前一声喊：
    谁把地堡去炸翻？
    跳出个战士吼一声：
    “这个任务我完成！”
　
    众人一看是老邵，
    他的名字都知道；
    那天诉苦会，
    讲的人人都落泪。
　
    邵洪生一生好命苦，
    从小没穿过一丝儿布，
    终朝每日光屁股。
    冬天雪花落，
    抱着胳臂打哆嗦。
　
    腊月滴水成冰霜，
    荒郊野外放牛羊，
    手脚冻成疮。
　
    去找地主讨件衣，
    苦苦哀求不答理：
    叫一声大爷不吱声，
    叫两声大爷变了脸，
    骂声狗日的少纠缠，
    冻死不过臭块地，
    大爷有钱再雇去。
　
    挨打挨骂受折磨，
    半辈子泡在眼泪里过。
　
    诉苦会上老邵讲的清：
    “苦是地主给，
    苦从老蒋生，
    地主老蒋一条根，
    拔了这条根，
    穷苦人民大翻身。”
　
    谁不知头一仗别人立了功，
    老邵瞅着早眼红，
　
    谁不知老邵有事蹩在心里头！
    党员去开会，
    老邵心难受；
    为什么人家也是一个脑袋两只
    手，
    我就不能够？
　
    这次不把地堡连根掀，
    我老邵革命算白干！
　
    大枪子弹全卸了，
    绑好鞋带紧紧腰，
    急忙动手捆炸药，
　
    划根火柴点着绳，
    风吹一点红。
　
    机枪步枪连声叫，
    掩护老邵送炸药。
　
    老邵窜到街当中，
    猫腰向前冲，
    脚下生了风。
　
    踏过鹿柴哗啦啦，
    飕飕子弹如雨下。
　
    手榴弹吭吭扔出来，
    炸裂火花迷人眼，
    块块黄土往上翻。
    老邵心如铁，
    老邵心如钢，
    扛着炸药向上闯。
　
    哇哇哇，
    机枪扫过来，
    老邵没躲开。
　
    炸药变了一座山，
    重重压在肩，
    脚下断了根，
    身子立不稳。
    两眼忽忽冒金花，
    打个“裂斜”倒地下。
　
    突击部队手握枪，
    但等炸药一声响。
　
    有人唉呀叫一声，
    莫非敌人打死了邵洪生？
　
    团团围住指导员，
    争着把雷点，
    胳臂举起象树林，
    指导员不知派谁人。
　
    忽然有人叫声道：
    老邵同志还活着！
　
    邵洪生一阵昏迷一阵醒，
    肚子打了个大窟窿，
    子弹搅的肚子痛，
    全身血染红。
　
    咬紧牙根不出声，
    两脚拼命向后蹬，
    胳臂肘子柱着地，
    一步一步爬上去。
　
    爬一截脑袋忽悠悠，
    爬两截血汗满地流。
　
    好个战士邵洪生！
    爬到两个枪眼正当中，
    炸药堆上地堡顶。
　
    咬牙去点引火线，
    引火点着向回转。
　
    背后轰隆隆，
    地堡腾上空！
　
    砖石飞舞起浪烟，
    地堡连根掀！
　
    指导员抱起邵洪生，
    听他朦胧叫一声：
    我的任务已完成。
　
    说完这句话，
    千呼万唤不答声。
　
    自从这日起，
    邵洪生的英名处处传。
    纪念邵洪生，
    毛泽东奖章挂家中，
    军区记他三大功。
　
    邵洪生名字写上英雄榜，
    邵洪生名字传遍城镇和村庄！
