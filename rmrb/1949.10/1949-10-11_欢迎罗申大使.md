Soviet Ambassador Roshchin arrived in our capital city yesterday. This is the tenth day after the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, which is celebrated by the people of China and the world. This is the first ambassador to our country from our first great ally. It is only natural that the people of our country welcome the envoy of our great ally with excitement and joy. From now on, the relations between China and the Soviet Union will enter a new historical era and will move unhindered towards a path of lasting, intimate friendship and cooperation.

The Chinese people are familiar with Mr. Roshchin. As early as 1939 and 1941, Mr. Roshchin was ordered to come to China as a military attaché. After the victory of the Soviet Union in the war against Germany, Mr. Roshchin was the Soviet ambassador to China. He represented the Soviet government, adhered to the great Stalin's foreign policy, and did his best to help the Chinese people defeat the Japanese invaders. However, because China at that time was still the old China under the reactionary rule of the imperialists and their running dog, the Kuomintang bandit gang, the profound friendship of the Soviet government and the Soviet people represented by Ambassador Roshchin at that time was blocked by the reactionaries, and the situation was extremely difficult. He had to negotiate with the reactionary Kuomintang government and wage a persistent struggle against the Kuomintang's despicable anti-Soviet and anti-communist conspiracies to support the Chinese people and clear the way for the genuine friendship and cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. At the same time, this struggle was essentially a struggle between the Chinese people and the Chinese reactionaries. The Chinese people will always remember the difficult past, and therefore, will always be grateful to the great friendly country, the Soviet Union, and its diplomatic representatives for all the sympathy and support they gave to the Chinese people's struggle against imperialist aggression and the Kuomintang bandit gang's criminal rule, overcoming all difficulties. Today, the situation is fundamentally different. The old China has perished, and the new China has been born. Especially at a time when imperialism is showing bewilderment, embarrassment, and awkwardness in the issue of recognizing the new China, Mr. Roshchin has gracefully arrived in Beijing as the first Soviet ambassador to our country to unveil a new history of permanent Sino-Soviet relations. How exciting this is for the people of China and the world, and how shocking to the imperialists and their henchmen!

Today, we warmly welcome Ambassador Roshchin. We would like to quote a sentence spoken by Ambassador Roshchin upon his arrival in Beijing to declare to the world: We "will make the greatest efforts to consolidate the intimate friendship between the Soviet Socialist Federation and the People's Republic of China, to defend world peace and international security!" We would also like to quote a sentence said by our Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai in welcoming Ambassador Roshchin to declare to the world: "The relations between China and the Soviet Union, the deep friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, will be further developed and consolidated in the future through the efforts of Ambassador Roshchin."

　　欢迎罗申大使
    苏联大使罗申先生，已于昨日到达我国首都。这是全中国以及全世界人民所狂欢庆祝的中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立后的第十天，这是我国的第一个伟大友邦派驻我国的第一任大使，我国人民满怀兴奋喜悦的心情，欢呼迎接我伟大友邦的使节是极当然的。从此，中苏两国邦交进入了一个崭新的历史时代，并将毫无阻碍地走向永久亲密的友谊与合作的道路。
    中国人民是熟识罗申先生的。早在一九三九年和一九四一年，罗申先生就曾以武官的身份奉命来到中国，而在苏联抗德战争胜利后，罗申先生又曾是苏联派驻中国的大使。他曾代表苏联政府，坚持贯彻伟大斯大林的外交政策，并尽力帮助中国人民战胜日寇。但由于当时的中国还是帝国主义及其走狗国民党匪帮反动统治的旧中国，这就使当时的罗申大使所代表的苏联政府和苏联人民对中国人民的深厚友谊被反动派所阻隔，处境极为困难，他曾不能不与国民党反动政府相周旋，与帝国主义国民党的卑劣的反苏反共阴谋作坚持的斗争，以支援中国人民，并为中苏两大民族真正的友谊合作廓清道路。同时，这个斗争在实质上也是中国人民与中国反动派的斗争。中国人民永远记得艰苦的过去，因而，也永远感激着伟大友邦苏联和他的外交代表排除万难对中国人民反抗帝国主义侵略、反对国民党匪帮罪恶统治的斗争所给予的一切同情与支援。今天，情形根本不同了，旧中国已经灭亡，新中国已经诞生，特别是帝国主义在今天正在承认新中国的问题上，表现着惶惑、窘困而尴尬的时候，罗申先生已翩然来到北京，以苏联驻我国首任大使的身份来揭开中苏永久邦交的新历史，这使中国和世界人民感到多么兴奋，而使帝国主义及其走卒们多么惊心动魄！
    在今天，我们热烈地欢迎罗申大使，我们愿引述罗申大使到达北京时所说的一句话来向全世界宣告：我们“将以最大的努力来巩固苏维埃社会主义联邦与中华人民共和国之间的亲切的友谊，以保卫世界和平与国际安全！”我们也愿再引述我国外交部长周恩来在欢迎罗申大使时所说的一句话来向全世界宣告：“中苏两国的邦交，中苏两国人民的深厚友谊，今后经过罗申大使的努力，将会更加发展和巩固起来。”
