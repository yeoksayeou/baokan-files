Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 23rd. Since the resumption of work in Fuzhou's factories, production has significantly increased compared to before. The Fujian Paper Mill resumed operations on September 19th, and in the month up to October 18th, it produced a total of 118 tons of paper, exceeding the planned target by 47.5%, breaking the factory's highest record since its establishment. The Songmao Chemical Factory produced 250 boxes of soap, totaling 10,000 jin, in 28 days. In the past, September, October, November, and December were the slow season, with monthly production only reaching 6,000 jin. Compared to the past, production has increased by more than two-thirds. The Jianhua Match Factory initially produced 25 baskets per day after liberation, but has recently increased this to 30 baskets, a 20% increase. The increase in production in various factories is the result of the People's Government's multi-faceted support for national industry and commerce, and the correct implementation of the policy of benefiting both labor and capital. For example, the Fujian Paper Mill and the Songmao Chemical Factory had already ceased operations in May under the Kuomintang's suppression policy before liberation. After liberation, the People's Government immediately ordered more than 70,000 pounds of paper from the former and 180 boxes of soap from the latter to help them resume operations. The Jianhua Match Factory had cancelled the female workers' allowance of 1.4 jin of rice per day in January of this year, and the workers' morale had been low. After the resumption of work, due to the large expansion of sales, the rice allowance was restored after consultation between labor and management. As a result, the workers' production enthusiasm greatly increased, production increased by 20%, and the waste of raw materials was greatly reduced.

　　福州各工厂生产量增加
    【新华社福州二十三日电】福州市各工厂复工以来产量较前显著增加。福建造纸厂自上月十九日开始复工，至本月十八日止一个月中，共产纸一百一十八吨，超出预定计划百分之四十七点五，打破了该厂创设以来的最高纪录。松茂化工厂二十八天中共产肥皂二百五十箱，合一万市斤。过去每年的九、十、十一、十二等月本为淡销季，每月仅产六千市斤。前后比较，产量增加了三分之二以上。建华火柴厂解放初期日产二十五篓，近日则提高至三十篓，增加百分之二十。各工厂生产量的提高，是人民政府对民族工商业多方扶植，和正确地执行了劳资两利政策的结果。如福建造纸厂、松茂化工厂，解放前在国民党的扼杀政策下，已于五月间先后停工。解放后，人民政府即向前者订购七万多磅纸，向后者订购一百八十箱肥皂，借以扶助其复业。建华火柴厂曾于今年一月取消了女工每日一斤四两的米贴，工人情绪一直很低。复工后，由于销路的大量扩展，经过劳资双方协议，恢复了米贴，结果工人生产情绪大为提高，产量提高了百分之二十，原料浪费现象也大为减少。
