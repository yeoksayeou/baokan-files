Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th. More than ten thousand worker representatives from Shanghai gathered at Yiyuan last night to welcome the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation. Rao Shushi, Liu Changsheng, Pan Hannian, and Guo Huaruo also attended. After the meeting began, Mao Qihua, Secretary-General of the Trade Union Preparatory Committee, extended greetings to the Soviet delegation on behalf of all Shanghai workers and delivered a welcoming speech stating: Shanghai workers suffered under the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in the past, and waged unyielding struggles. Today we have won. The victory is due to the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and to the encouragement of the Soviet October Revolution and the help of its valuable experience. Therefore, the Chinese working class and the Chinese people must now intensify their study of the Soviet Union's theories and experiences in politics, economics, and culture to build a new China. Liu Changsheng introduced the members of the Soviet delegation to the worker representatives one by one. Subsequently, Deomidov, Chairman of the International Book Association of the Soviet delegation, biologist Stoletov, and Markov, Deputy Minister of the Far East Department of the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association, delivered speeches one after another, all of which were warmly applauded by the audience. Deomidov said, "The Soviet people will always stand with the Chinese people!" Stoletov pointed out: The founding of the People's Republic of China and the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union are great historical events. After the meeting, entertainment programs were performed.

　　上海万余工人代表
  　欢迎苏文化代表团
    【新华社上海十八日电】上海万余工人代表于十七日晚在逸园集会欢迎苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团。饶漱石、刘长胜、潘汉年、郭化若均前往参加。大会开始后总工会筹委会秘书长毛齐华代表全上海职工向苏联代表团致敬并致欢迎词称：上海职工过去受尽了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的压迫，并作了不屈不挠的斗争。今天是胜利了。胜利是由于有共产党及毛主席的领导，是由于苏联十月革命胜利的鼓舞和它的宝贵经验的帮助。因此中国工人阶级和中国人民今后更要加紧学习苏联在政治、经济、文化各方面的理论和经验，来建设新中国。刘长胜逐一介绍了苏代表团团员与工人代表们见面。接着，苏联代表团国际书籍协会主席德奥米多夫、生物学家斯托列托夫、苏联对外文化协会远东部副部长马尔柯夫相继发表演说，都博得全场热烈鼓掌欢迎。德奥米多夫说“苏联人民永远与中国人民站在一起！”斯托列托夫指出：中华人民共和国的成立和中苏建立邦交，是伟大的历史事件。会后，进行游艺节目。
