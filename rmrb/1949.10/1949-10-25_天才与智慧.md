　　Genius and Wisdom
　　Student of Girls' No. 3 Middle School Tan Zenglu
　　Any matter, any problem, its right, wrong, good, and bad all differ according to one's class standpoint. In capitalist society, capitalists consider "exploitation" to be reasonable and moral, building the enjoyment of a few on the suffering of the working people, and consider this to be civilization and wisdom. They despise workers and peasants, look down on labor, and ridicule workers and peasants for having no culture, while extolling themselves as the most noble and civilized. But from the standpoint of the masses, as Gorky said, "I think the civilization of the American big bourgeoisie is the most deformed civilization on this planet. It has developed many of the shameful deformities of European civilization to a terrible degree, so the civilization and wisdom that they sing about are, in our opinion, the ugliest filth. They use all kinds of religious fallacies to resist the development of scientific truth, distort the source of genius and morality, and attempt to bind the rebellious thoughts of the exploited, turning the brilliant creativity of others—scientists, technicians, poets—the blood and sweat of our second nature, the laborers, into small pieces of yellow metal and checks."

　　Today, millions of oppressed people are unleashing a revolutionary torrent, shouting the roar of human liberation, and striving to reverse the giant wheel of history. The heroic warriors are using their fiery blood to wash away the stains on the earth. From now on, labor will be elevated to the most glorious position. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, class love, unity, and mutual assistance are brought into play to jointly create a beautiful world. This is the genius and wisdom we sing about—the genius and wisdom of all mankind.

　　Genius and wisdom, due to the accumulation of human labor experience, arise among the ordinary working masses, without any deformity or peculiarity. Only the talent and wisdom of the laborers are the greatest and most worthy of admiration. This is no longer worth arguing about. The genius leaders Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong selflessly dedicated their talents and wisdom to the working masses, which demonstrated their greatness. The truth is so simple: if scientists, technicians, artists, politicians, educators... do not serve the broad masses, but instead serve to maintain the interests of the reactionary class, to consolidate the regime of the reactionary class, their genius and wisdom become the ugliest, ridiculed and唾骂. Only the most foolish people will support and praise them.

　　天才与智慧
    女三中学生  谭增璐
    任何事情，任何问题，它的是、非、好、坏，都因了阶级立场的不同而各异。在资本主义社会中，资本家们把“剥削”认为是合理，是道德，把少数人的享乐建立在劳动人民的苦痛上，认为这是文明，是智慧。他们轻视工农，卑视劳动，耻笑工农没有文化，而高唱自己是最高尚，最文明的，但以人民大众的立场来看，正如高尔基所说：“我以为美国大资产阶级的文明，是我们这星球上最畸形的文明，它把欧罗巴洲文明的众多可耻的畸形，都发展到可怕的程度，所以在他们口中高唱出来的文明与智慧，而在我们认为是最丑恶的污物；他们这用种种的宗教邪说来抵制科学真理的发展，曲解天才与道德的来源，企图束缚被剥削者的反抗思想，把别人辉煌的创造力——科学家、技术家、诗人——我们的第二自然的劳动者的血汗，变成一小片一小片的黄色金属和一张张的支票。”
    如今千百万的被压迫者掀起革命的洪流。呐喊着解放人类的吼声，努力的扭转了历史的巨轮。英勇的战士们，正在用火热的鲜血冲刷着地球上的污迹，从此劳动被提升到最光荣的地位。在共产党的领导下，发挥阶级的友爱团结与互助，共同创造一个美好的世界，这便是我们歌颂的天才与智慧——全人类的天才与智慧。
    天才与智慧，由于人类劳动经验的积累，它产生在平凡的劳动群众之中，没有任何畸形与特殊，也只有劳动者的才、智是最伟大、最值得敬佩，这已没有任何值得争论的。天才的领导者马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林、毛泽东把他们的才智，毫不自私的供献给劳动群众，才表现了他们的伟大。真理即是如此的简单，假如科学家、技术家、艺术家、政治家、教育家……不服务于广大的群众，而是为了维护反动阶级的利益，为了巩固反动阶级的政权，他们的天才与智慧，便成为最丑陋的，被人耻笑与唾骂的，只有最愚蠢的人，才去拥护与歌颂。
