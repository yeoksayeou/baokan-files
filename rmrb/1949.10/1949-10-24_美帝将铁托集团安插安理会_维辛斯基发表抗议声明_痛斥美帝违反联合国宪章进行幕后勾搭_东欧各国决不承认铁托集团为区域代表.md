Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd: TASS, New York -- The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the 20th to elect three non-permanent members of the Security Council to replace Argentina, Canada, and the Ukrainian Republic, whose terms will expire at the end of the year.

　　The election of non-permanent members of the Security Council is conducted in accordance with Article 23 of the United Nations Charter, namely, adhering to the principle of equitable geographical distribution of seats, and according to the established tradition that candidates for non-permanent members of the Security Council are consistently nominated by countries belonging to their respective geographical regions. At this session, Ecuador, India, and Czechoslovakia were nominated as candidates on this basis. Czechoslovakia was unanimously nominated by the delegations of five Eastern European countries. However, a group of delegations led by the United States delegation, disregarding the will of these countries, and after engaging in behind-the-scenes collusion with the Tito clique, blatantly violated the principles of the United Nations and nominated Yugoslavia as a candidate. In the first ballot of the General Assembly, Ecuador and India were elected by a majority vote. Yugoslavia, despite behind-the-scenes collusion, failed to obtain the necessary number of votes. Therefore, a second ballot had to be held, and only after the United States exerted pressure on some delegates again did Yugoslavia obtain the necessary number of votes—thirty-nine votes, while the delegations of nineteen countries voted in favor of Czechoslovakia.

　　When the results of the vote were announced, Vyshinsky, representing the Soviet delegation, issued the following statement: "The results of the election of non-permanent members of the Security Council announced at this session of the General Assembly clearly show that the election was conducted in violation of the United Nations Charter (Article 23 of the Charter requires adherence to the principle of equitable geographical distribution of seats in the election of non-permanent members of the Security Council), and also violates the firmly established tradition that candidates for non-permanent members of the Security Council are consistently nominated by countries belonging to their respective geographical regions. Both of these principles have been strictly adhered to in all previous elections of non-permanent members of the Security Council. Now, these principles have been blatantly violated. Everyone knows that the five Eastern European countries unanimously nominated Czechoslovakia. These countries did not nominate Yugoslavia as a candidate. However, contrary to the practice in this and previous elections of non-permanent members of the Security Council, Czechoslovakia's candidacy was not supported by a majority of delegations, while Yugoslavia's candidacy was supported."

　　Vyshinsky continued, "Yugoslavia is being pulled into the Security Council, not as a result of a free election conducted in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and established traditions, but as a result of behind-the-scenes collusion between Yugoslavia, the United States, and several other delegations that have clearly decided to exploit the political situation formed by Yugoslavia's relations with the Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democracies to achieve their own purposes. This situation is due to the behind-the-scenes collusion between the United States and several other delegations that intend to strengthen their position in the Security Council and attempt to turn the Security Council into a docile tool of the Anglo-American bloc, and Yugoslavia."

　　Vyshinsky finally declared, "The Soviet delegation hereby declares with full determination that Yugoslavia does not represent the Eastern European countries in the Security Council, and cannot and will never be considered the representative of the Eastern European countries in the Security Council. The Soviet delegation believes that the insertion of Yugoslavia into the Security Council is another violation of the United Nations Charter, which undermines the basis of cooperation in the United Nations." (Many delegates applauded).

　　Vyshinsky's speech was interrupted twice by the chairman, Romulo.

　　Afterward, the General Assembly re-elected six members of the Economic and Social Council whose terms had expired. As a result, Czechoslovakia, Mexico, Iran, the United States, Pakistan, and Canada were elected by a majority vote.

　　美帝将铁托集团安插安理会
  　维辛斯基发表抗议声明
    痛斥美帝违反联合国宪章进行幕后勾搭
    东欧各国决不承认铁托集团为区域代表
    【新华社北京二十三日电】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会于二十日举行全体会议，选举安理会的三席非常任理事，以代替将于年底满期的阿根廷、加拿大和乌克兰共和国。
    安理会非常任理事的选举，是按照联合国宪章第二十三条，即遵守按地理公平分配席位的原则，根据安理会非常任理事的候选者一贯经由属于各该地理区域的国家提名的这一传统而举行的。在本届会议上，正是在这种基础上提出了厄瓜多尔、印度和捷克斯洛伐克作候选者的。捷克是由东欧五个国家的代表团一致提名的。但是，以美国代表团为首的一批代表团，无视这些国家的意志，并在与铁托集团进行幕后勾搭之后，横暴地违反了联合国的原则，而提名南斯拉夫为候选者。在大会第一次的表决中，厄瓜多尔和印度以多数票当选。而南斯拉夫，尽管经过幕后的勾搭，还是未能获得必要的票数。于是不得不举行第二次的表决，而且是在美国对某些代表再度施以压力之后，南斯拉夫才获得必要的票数——三十九票，另有十九个国家的代表团投票赞成捷克。
    表决结果宣布的时候，维辛斯基代表苏联代表团发表声明如下：“联大此次会议所宣布的安理会非常任理事选举的结果，极其明白地表明了：选举进行的情形违反了联合国宪章（宪章第二十三条要求在安理会非常任理事选举时，遵守按地理公平分配席位的原则），也违反了牢固确立了的传统，依照这种传统，安理会非常任理事的候选者，一贯是由属于各该地理区域的国家提名的。这两个原则以前在安理会非常任理事国的一切选举中，都被严格地遵守着。而如今，这些原则却已被横暴地破坏了。大家知道：东欧五国曾一致提名捷克。这些国家并没有提出南斯拉夫作候选者。然而，这一次和历次安理会非常任理事选举的惯例相反，捷克的候选资格没有受到多数代表团的支持，而南斯拉夫的候选资格却受到了支持。”
    维辛斯基继称，“南斯拉夫正被拉进安理会中来，这不是按照联合国宪章的原则与确立的传统进行自由选举的结果，而是南斯拉夫、美国及其他显然决定要利用南斯拉夫与苏联和东欧人民民主国家之关系中所形成的政治形势以遂其自身之目的的若干代表团幕后勾搭的结果。这种情况的造成，是由于美国及若干其他打算加强其在安理会中的地位，企图变安理会为美英集团的驯从工具的代表团与南斯拉夫进行幕后勾搭的结果。”
    维辛斯基最后宣称，“苏联代表团就此以充分的决心声明：南斯拉夫在安理会中并不代表东欧各国，不能而且绝不会被认为是东欧各国在安理会中的代表。苏联代表团认为，南斯拉夫之被安插在安理会中，是对于联合国宪章的再一次的违反，这破坏着联合国中合作的基础。”（许多代表鼓掌）。
    维辛斯基的讲演曾经两度被主席罗慕洛所打断。
    其后，大会即改选经社理事会六个任期已满的理事国。结果，捷克、墨西哥、伊朗、美国、巴基斯坦与加拿大以多数票当选。
