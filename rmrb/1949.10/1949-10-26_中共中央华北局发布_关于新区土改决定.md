The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau Issues
Decision on Land Reform in New Areas

[Reported by this newspaper] The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau issued a decision on land reform in new areas on the 10th of this month. The full text is as follows:

(I)

In the new areas (including some restored areas) within the North China region, with a population of approximately fifteen million, it is necessary to implement land reform. Because the old liberated areas have already eliminated feudal forces and the peasants have obtained land, this has profoundly influenced and continues to influence the people of all classes in the newly liberated areas. Therefore, the method of using rent and interest reduction policies as a transition to the policy of equal land distribution is no longer necessary in these areas. In order to quickly restore and develop agricultural production, it is decided that, with the exception of Suiyuan Province, where the situation is special and equal land distribution will not be implemented for the time being, all new and restored areas in other provinces will complete the task of equal land distribution this winter and spring.

(II)

When implementing equal land distribution, the following policies must be resolutely implemented:

A. Confiscate the land and feudal property of the landlord class, levy the surplus land and feudal part of the property of old-style rich peasants, and distribute it to landless and land-poor peasants. However, old-style rich peasants and landlords must be left with the same share of land and property as the peasants, and the method of driving them out of their homes is not allowed. Abolish all feudal and semi-feudal usury, but loans from the People's Government and People's Bank, buying and selling transactions among the people, current accounts, friendly loans, and wage accounts of workers and shop assistants shall not be abolished and shall remain valid. Appropriate care should be given to genuine enlightened gentry recognized by the masses. For intellectuals (including those from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds and their families), the policy of striving to transform and educate them to serve the people should be adopted. Land and property equal to that of peasants should be distributed to landlords and rich peasants who have returned to their hometowns and "stubborn pseudo-elements." Herds of cattle and sheep belonging to landlords and rich peasants in areas such as Chahar North may not be distributed. Orchards and farms operated in a progressive manner by landlords and rich peasants in various regions shall remain under the management of the original owners and shall not be confiscated or distributed. Forests belonging to villages shall be owned by the village collectively. Graves and trees on graves shall not be moved and shall be owned by the original owners or clans.

A selection of large houses belonging to large landlords suitable for stationing troops, running hospitals, or running schools should be retained in a planned manner with the approval of the provincial government.

B. Firmly and unswervingly implement the policy of "leaving the middle untouched and leveling both ends," and abolish the absolute equal distribution method of dividing land by population. This will accurately eliminate feudalism, appropriately satisfy the demands of poor peasants and farm laborers, and effectively consolidate the unity between poor peasants, farm laborers, and middle peasants. Past practices of drawing land from well-to-do middle peasants have proven to be more harmful than beneficial, so they should not be touched at all in the future.

C. It is necessary to carefully and correctly classify classes, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, unite more than 90% of the masses in the countryside, isolate rural feudal forces, and consolidate and expand the rural people's democratic united front. To this end, we must fully follow the Central Committee's "Decision on Two Documents of 1933" and Comrade Ren Bishi's report on "Several Issues in Land Reform," using the democratic method of self-reporting, public discussion, and three postings to determine the cases, resolutely opposing the erroneous practices of package deals, compulsory orders, and arbitrarily raising or lowering components.

D. Organize peasant representative conferences and peasant associations with poor peasants and farm laborers as the backbone, uniting all middle peasants and all working people, as the legitimate executive organs of land reform (the superior peasant associations and superior governments can correct them when they consider it inappropriate). The leading organs of the peasant representative conferences and peasant associations should ensure that two-thirds to two-thirds of the members are poor peasants and farm laborers and no less than one-third are middle peasants. After the majority of peasants have improved their class consciousness and strengthened their organization during the land reform, village, district, and county-level people's representative conferences should be established immediately to thoroughly complete the task of transforming the old regime.

E. It is necessary to distinguish between landlords, old-style rich peasants, large landlords and small and medium landlords, despotic landlords and general landlords, rich peasants who started by working and general rich peasants, and general rich peasants and rich peasants with despotic characteristics, and treat them differently; well-to-do middle peasants are part of the middle peasants and should be distinguished in principle from rich peasants and should not be infringed upon. For evil despots who have committed heinous crimes and harmed the area and are hated by the broad masses, the masses should be led to carry out organized liquidation struggles. Mass struggle methods should be closely combined with the struggle methods of the people's courts, and random beatings, deductions, killings, or other forms of disguised corporal punishment are strictly prohibited. If the death penalty is required, it must be approved by the county people's court and submitted to the North China People's Government for approval before it can be executed.

F. The industry and commerce of landlords and old-style rich peasants must be strictly distinguished from their feudal land property, and the policy of protecting industry and commerce must be resolutely implemented. The original industry and commerce of landlords and rich peasants in cities or villages, including property already transferred to industry and commerce, as well as property such as factory sites, shops, workshops, houses, machines, tools, and cash connected to industry and commerce, and handicraft tools (such as spinning wheels, looms, cotton gins, and flower presses), shall not be confiscated.

G. Regarding the hidden wealth of landlords and rich peasants (gold, silver, and treasures buried underground, etc.), while declaring it illegal, they should be encouraged to take it out voluntarily, and the government guarantees to leave a portion for themselves (for example, leaving 30%), allowing them to invest in industry and commerce, and the rest will be reasonably distributed to the peasants. If it is a large amount of gold, silver, and other special property, it should be taken over by the national bank and not distributed. However, if they are still unwilling to take it out voluntarily, they can only continue to investigate, and no forced digging is allowed to prevent random beatings, deductions, and killings.

(III)

The provincial committees should formulate specific implementation plans for land reform in the new areas of their respective provinces and send responsible cadres to help the new area party committees prepare for land reform, such as adjusting and training cadres, convening meetings, learning to classify classes, clarifying policy boundaries, what things are allowed to be done, what things are not allowed to be done, and formulating plans. This preparation work should be completed before the end of October, and county and district cadres should strive to go to the villages in late October, combine with autumn plowing, understand the specific situation, discover and unite activists, widely publicize the policy of "leaving the middle untouched and leveling both ends," organize and reorganize mass teams, talk about class, classify class, connect with grievances, and encourage the masses to have the courage to reform the land, and then organize and lead the distribution of land property of the feudal class. The method of struggle, except for the very few local tyrants and evil gentry who can be punished by the people's court (which is necessary), should be solved by reasoning, explaining the law, and explaining the policy in all other cases. In the process, every step must conscientiously follow the mass line, and neither coercion nor tailism is allowed. The leading organs of the party at all levels must fully grasp the leadership of all land reform work, and there must never be a state of anarchy and indiscipline as in the past. All land reform work cadres must be held responsible for fully complying with the party's land reform policies and must not modify them without authorization.

The people in the new areas are particularly impoverished due to the long-term rule and devastation of the enemy. Therefore, when carrying out land reform, we should closely combine the solution of the people's immediate living difficulties with the development of winter production, otherwise, we will inevitably be divorced from the masses. When carrying out land reform in some areas severely affected by floods, we should pay particular attention to closely combining it with production and disaster relief. If land reform cannot be carried out due to severe disasters and scattered populations, it can be postponed and production and disaster relief work can be carried out with all our strength.

(IV)

In the land reform in the new areas, party members should be developed in a planned and led manner in accordance with the party constitution, and party fortresses - branches - should be established.

(V)

Various legacy issues in land reform and party rectification in the old and semi-old areas should also be completely resolved this winter and spring in accordance with the policies already determined by the Central Committee and the North China Bureau. And protect the land rights and property rights of the people of all classes after land reform in accordance with the law from infringement, and benefit the recovery and development of production.

(VI)

This winter and spring, Suiyuan will not carry out land reform for the time being, in order to concentrate its efforts on transforming the old regime and the old army, thoroughly eliminating bandits, carrying out the struggle against evil despots, implementing rent and interest reduction, raising the awareness of the masses, consolidating the revolutionary order, and preparing for land reform next winter.

　　中共中央华北局发布　
    关于新区土改决定
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局于本月十日发布关于新区土改决定，全文如下：
    （一）
    华北全境约有一千五百万人口的新区（内含一部分恢复区）需要实行土地改革。由于老解放区已经消灭了封建势力，农民已经得到土地，这就深刻地影响了并继续影响着新解放区各阶层的人民。因此，把减租减息政策作为过渡到平分土地政策的办法，在这些地区已无必要。为了迅速恢复与发展农业生产，决定除绥远全省因情况特殊暂不实行平分土地外，其他各省新区及恢复区一律于今冬明春全部完成平分土地的任务。
    （二）
    在执行平分土地时，必须坚决贯彻以下政策：
    甲、没收地主阶级的土地及其封建财产，征收旧式富农多余的土地及其财产的封建部分，分配给无地少地的农民。但须留给旧式富农与地主和农民同样的一份土地和财产，不许再用扫地出门的办法。废除一切封建半封建性的高利贷，但人民政府与人民银行的贷款、人民相互间买卖交易、来往货帐、友谊借贷以及工人店员之工资帐等，均不得废除，一律继续有效。对于为群众所公认的真正的开明士绅，应予以适当的照顾。对于知识分子（包括地主富农成份及其家庭出身者在内），应采取争取改造教育为人民服务的方针。对于还乡的地主富农及“顽伪分子”，均应分给和农民同样的一份土地与财产。察北等地地主富农之成群牛羊，可不分配。各地区地主富农，用进步方式经营之果树园、农场，仍归原主经营，不没收，不分配。属村的森林归村公有。坟地及坟地上之树木不动，归原主或合族所有。
    由大地主之大房屋中选择适合驻军办医院办学校者，有计划地经过省府批准保留一部分。
    乙、坚定不移的实行中间不动两头平的平分政策，废除以人口除土地的绝对平分办法。这样作，既能准确消灭封建、适当满足贫雇农要求，又能切实巩固贫农、雇农、中农之间的团结。过去抽动富裕中农的土地，事实证明害多利少，故今后应完全不动。
    丙、必须慎重地、正确地划分阶级，分清敌我界限，团结农村百分之九十以上的群众，孤立乡村封建势力，巩固扩大乡村人民民主统一战线。为此，必须完全依照中央“关于一九三三年两个文件的决定”及任弼时同志“土地改革中的几个问题”的报告，用自报公议三榜定案的民主方式，划分阶级，坚决反对包办代替强迫命令与随便提高或降低成份的错误作法。
    丁、组织以贫雇农为骨干的、团结全体中农及一切劳动人民的农民代表会议及农会，为土地改革的合法执行机关（上级农会及上级政府认为不当时可以改正）。农民代表会议及农会的领导机关，应保证有二分之一到三分之二的贫雇农和不少于三分之一的中农参加。待多数农民在土改中阶级觉悟提高与组织性加强后，应即建立村、区、县三级人民代表会议，彻底完成改造旧政权的任务。
    戊、必须将地主、旧式富农、大地主与中小地主、恶霸地主与一般地主、劳动起家的富农与一般富农、一般富农与带恶霸性的富农等加以区别，分别对待；富裕中农是中农的一部分，应与富农加以原则的区别，不得侵犯。对罪大恶极为害一方为广大群众所痛恨的恶霸，则应领导群众，进行有组织的清算斗争。群众性的斗争方式应与人民法庭的斗争方式紧密结合，严禁乱打、乱扣、乱杀或其他变相肉刑。如需处死者，必须经县人民法庭判决呈请华北人民政府批准后，始能执行。
    己、必须把地主、旧式富农的工商业与其封建土地财产严格加以区别，坚决实行保护工商业的政策。对地主富农在城市或乡村原有之工商业，包括已转入工商业之财产在内，以及与工商业相连之厂址、店铺、作坊、住房、机器、工具、现金等财产，及手工业工具（如纺花车、织布机、弹花机、压花机等），均不得没收。
    庚、对地主富农的底财（埋藏地下之金银财宝等），一面宣布其为非法，一面应鼓励其自动拿出，政府保证给其本人留下一部分（比如留百分之三十），准其投入工商业，其余则归农民合理分配。如系大宗金银及其他特殊财物，则应收归国家银行所有，不得分配。但如其仍不愿自动拿出，则亦只能继续调查，不许强追硬挖，以防乱打、乱扣、乱杀。
    （三）
    各省委应定出本省新区土改具体实施方案，并派负责干部帮助新区党委进行土改准备工作；如调整训练干部，召开会议，学会划阶级，分清政策界限，那些事允许做，那些事不允许做，制定计划等。此项准备工作，应于十月底前作好，县区干部争取十月下旬到村，结合秋耕，了解具体情况，发现并团结积极分子，广泛宣传中间不动两头平的政策，组织与整编群众队伍，讲阶级，划阶级，联系诉苦，鼓起群众土改勇气，然后有组织有领导地实行分配封建阶级的土地财产。斗争方式，除对极少数的土豪恶霸经过人民法院可以惩办外（这是必须的），其他一律采取说理说法讲政策的办法解决之。在进行中，每一步骤均须认真走群众路线，既不许强迫命令，也不许尾巴主义。各级党的领导机关，必须完全掌握全部土改工作的领导，绝不许再有过去那样无政府无纪律的状态出现。要责成一切土改工作干部，全部遵守党的土改政策，不得擅自修改。
    新区人民在敌人长期统治摧残下，生活特别贫困，因此，进行土改，应将解决人民眼前生活困难与开展冬季生产密切结合，否则必然会脱离群众。有些水灾严重的地区进行土改时，尤应与生产救灾密切结合。如因灾情过重，人口分散，不能进行土改者，可暂缓进行，以全力进行生产救灾工作。
    （四）
    在新区土改中，要有计划有领导地按照党章发展党员，建立党的堡垒——支部。
    （五）
    老区、半老区中，土改、整党中之各种遗留问题，亦应依照中央与华北局已确定的政策，于今冬明春全部结束。并依法保障土改后各阶层人民之地权财权不受侵犯，而利生产之恢复与发展。
    　　　　（六）
    今冬明春，绥远暂不进行土改，以便集中力量，改造旧政权、旧军队，并澈底清剿土匪，开展反恶霸斗争，实行减租减息，提高群众觉悟，巩固革命秩序，为明年冬季土改作好准备工作。
