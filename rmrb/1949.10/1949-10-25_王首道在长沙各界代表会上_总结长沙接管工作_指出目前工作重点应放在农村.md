Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, October 24th: Wang Shoudao, Deputy Director of the Changsha Military Control Commission, reported on the basic summary of the peaceful takeover of Changsha and the guiding principles for building a new Changsha at the meeting of representatives from all circles in Changsha City on the 15th. He first pointed out that after the peaceful liberation of Changsha and nearby counties, the takeover work adopted the method of consulting with the uprising army authorities and gradually proceeding with the takeover in a step-by-step manner.

Then, he summarized the basic takeover by various departments over the past two months as follows:

(1) Military and Police Takeover Work

Regarding the uprising army, in addition to maintaining the original establishment and concentrating them in designated locations for rectification and training, appropriate steps were taken to help them consolidate their internal affairs. Because the composition of the uprising army was complex, and the ideological and organizational preparation work was insufficient beforehand, under the complex circumstances at the time, hidden enemy agents used every possible opportunity to engage in conspiracies of provocation, sowing discord, deception, and spreading rumors, so the morale of the army was not solid enough in the early stages, and even partial mutinies occurred. Experience has proven that if we do not distinguish between friends and enemies, do not take decisive and rapid measures to deal with all special agents who continue to do evil, do not educate the troops with revolutionary spirit, do not establish revolutionary political work in the troops, and do not improve the relationship between officers and soldiers and between the army and the people, then it will be impossible to consolidate the uprising troops.

(2) Political Power Takeover Work

The provincial government was gradually transformed through consultation and reorganization. Other municipal and county political institutions adopted a handover and takeover method that combined top-down and bottom-up approaches. The People's Government adopted a cautious attitude towards the handling of old personnel. The government tried its best to take care of those who had a skill and were willing to serve the people, either by continuing to employ them, providing them with learning opportunities, or introducing them to other occupations. Only a few reactionary elements or those who had no working ability at all but relied on marriage and other relationships to hold empty positions, or those who could not endure hardship and voluntarily requested resignation, were dismissed. In terms of public security, the first step was to take over the armed forces of the old police force, and the original person in charge was responsible for handing over all archives and major cases and intelligence, and quickly restoring police work. Recently, work has also been carried out to register and collect private guns and register Kuomintang special agents. Within half a month, more than 400 private guns were collected and nearly 200 special agents were registered. This work is underway. The takeover of political power has also proved that in areas of peaceful takeover, the old political organs of temporary or transitional temporary institutions that must be temporarily retained must be reorganized and transformed, and senior officials of the CCP or the People's Liberation Army must participate to show the masses that the nature of this political power has changed in order to ensure that all government orders are implemented.

(3) Financial and Economic Takeover Work

The Military Control Commission took over a total of 89 units in banking, trade, industry, mining, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, finance, and grain, with 2,972 employees and 7,501 workers. The takeover of each enterprise adopted a method that combined top-down and bottom-up approaches, without disrupting its original structure, mobilizing employees to participate in assistance, and at the same time adopting the step of "combining takeover and management," quickly restoring business and production based on necessity and possibility. In terms of finance and trade, the main task was to take over the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank and quickly restore their operations. In order to develop production, regulate the market, and exchange materials, trade companies were also established in a timely manner. Since the Garrison Command announced on August 11 that the ratio of RMB to silver dollars was 2,000 to 1, the ratio has not changed until now. On September 1, the Military Control Commission issued an order prohibiting the circulation of silver dollars. The situation after this measure was extremely good, and the RMB has now occupied a large market. Prices have been basically stable and have not risen much in the past two months. This also shows that the price of silver dollars must be set according to the actual market situation, and trade companies and banks must use a large amount of materials to cooperate in regulating the market. The support of the broad masses of the people for the RMB also played a very important role. In addition, the People's Bank also launched industrial and commercial loans and savings deposits in real terms, and trade companies launched the distribution of cotton yarn, the purchase of finished products, and assistance to private machine and handicraft industries in restoring production, all of which have achieved results. As of the end of September, the number of households restored in the indigenous cloth industry was more than six times that before liberation, the number of households restored in the knitting industry increased by 28 percent compared with before liberation, and the number of households restored in the dyeing and weaving industry increased by 90 percent compared with before liberation. As for the issue of employee salaries, at the beginning we adopted a temporary borrowing method, and we did not distinguish between factories that continued to operate during implementation, but mechanically adopted this egalitarian method across the board, which resulted in a decline in the morale of some employees and a sharp drop in production. However, in September, we adopted the measure of original position and original salary for enterprises that had resumed work, and officially issued salaries to production units that had resumed work or were partially resumed, and issued maintenance fees to production units that had not resumed work, in order to promote the rapid and complete resumption of production in all enterprises. Now the handover and inventory work in finance and economy has basically ended, and the focus of future work is to shift to organizing the working class, improving production and enterprise management, in order to achieve economic accounting, improve output quality, and reduce costs.

(4) Transportation Takeover Work

More than 100 large and small units were taken over, with approximately 15,000 employees. The railway was heavily damaged by the White bandits, many bridges were blown up, and the employees suffered extreme hardship due to the large number of people and the undeveloped business. However, the workers were in high spirits, overcame countless difficulties, and achieved great results. The recovery of highways was even faster. Other telecommunications and postal services were generally intact when they were taken over, and now various businesses can be fully restored quickly.

(5) Cultural and Educational Takeover Work

The takeover steps were to first take over newspapers and cultural institutions, then take over public schools, and maintain the original state for private schools. In schools, a slow improvement method was adopted. The reactionary training system and reactionary civics, history, and other courses were immediately abolished, while other courses remained temporarily unchanged, but new political courses were added.

(6) Organizational Leadership

In terms of organizational leadership, the Military Control Commission adopted a prudent policy. In the deployment of the takeover, the first step was for cadres to conduct good investigation and research in advance to understand the situation and study policies and guidelines. When using cadres, the principle of few but elite was adopted.

Wang Shoudao finally said when talking about the future direction of building a new Changsha for the people: At present, Changsha is basically a commercial and consumer city. In the total number of enterprises, industry accounts for about 21 percent (excluding railways), while commerce accounts for 79 percent; in terms of the proportion of public and private, public ownership accounts for about 10 percent, while private ownership accounts for about 90 percent. Among private enterprises, the vast majority are handicrafts. Transportation has not yet fully recovered, and trade exchanges between urban and rural areas are just beginning. Therefore, in the work of building a new Changsha, restoring and developing commerce and transportation will still be the focus for a certain period of time. At the same time, Changsha is an inland city, and its existence and development mainly rely on rural areas. Therefore, in order to develop the city's commerce and industry, it is necessary to first revitalize the rural economy and increase the purchasing power of farmers. At present, in the whole province, the collection of public grain, ensuring the supply of the army, and financial supply are the center of all current work. Due to these circumstances, our current focus should be on rural areas, carrying out bandit suppression, establishing local armed forces, opposing the chief local bullies and bad township and baojia personnel, implementing reasonable burdens, reducing rent and interest, in order to gradually and step by step transition to the implementation of land reform, and then shift the focus of work to the city.

　　王首道在长沙各界代表会上
  　总结长沙接管工作
    指出目前工作重点应放在农村
    【新华社长沙二十四日电】长沙军管会副主任王首道十五日在长沙市各界代表会议上报告长沙和平接管工作基本总结与建设新长沙的方针。他首先指出长沙及附近各县的和平解放后，接管工作是采取与起义军当局商谈和逐渐地有步骤地进行接管的方式。
    接着他将两个月来各部门和平接管基本总结分述于下：
    （一）军警接管工作
    在起义军方面除维持原建制集中指定地点整训外，并采取妥善步骤，帮助他们巩固内部。因为起义军内部成份复杂，又加上事前思想上组织上的准备工作不够，在当时的复杂情况下，内部隐藏的特务便利用一切可能的机会，从事挑拨离间、欺骗造谣等阴谋破坏活动，故在初期军心还不够巩固，甚至发生部分的哗变行为。经验证明：如果不分清敌友，对一切继续作恶的特务分子不采取果断的迅速处理办法，不以革命精神教育部队，不在部队中建立革命的政治工作，改善官兵、军民关系，那末，要巩固起义部队是不可能的。
    （二）政权接管工作
    省政府是经过协商改组而逐渐改造的，其他市县政权机构，则采取自上而下与自下而上配合的移交接管。对旧人员的处理，人民政府采取了慎重态度，凡有一技之长而愿为人民服务的，政府都尽力设法照顾，或继续留用，或予以学习机会，或介绍其他职业。仅仅对于少数反动分子或根本没有工作能力而是依靠姻亲等关系挂空衔的人，或者不能吃苦自动请求辞退者，才予以遣散。在公安方面，首先是接收旧警察人员武装，并由原负责人负责将全部档案及大的案件、情报交清，迅速恢复警察工作。最近又进行了登记收缴私人枪支和登记国民党特务分子的工作，半个月内就收缴了私人枪支四百余支，登记特务分子将近二百人。这项工作正在展开。政权接管工作又证明，在和平接管地区，凡必须暂时保留的或过渡性的临时机构的旧有政权机关，必须经过改组改造方式，由中共或解放军的高级负责人参加，在群众中表明此一政权性质业已改变，才能使一切政令贯彻施行。
    （三）财政经济接管工作
    军管会共接管了银行、贸易、工矿、农林、水利、财粮等八十九单位，职员二千九百七十二人，工人七千五百零一人。各企业接管都是采取自上而下与自下而上互相配合的接管方式，不打乱其原来机构，发动职工们参加协助，同时又采取“接与管结合”的步骤，根据必须与可能，迅速恢复业务和生产。金融贸易方面，主要是接管了中国、中央、交通、农民各个银行并使其迅速恢复营业。为着发展生产、调剂市场与交流物资，又及时成立了贸易公司。自八月十一日警备司令部宣布人民币与银元的比率为二千比一以后，直到现在比率尚未更改。九月一日军管会明令禁止银元流通。这一措施经过情形极好，人民币现已占领了广大的市场，两个月来物价基本平稳，上升不大。这又说明了银元牌价的订定必须根据市场的实际情况，同时贸易公司与银行必须以大量物资来配合调剂市场。而广大人民对人民币的拥护所起的作用也极大。此外，人民银行还举办了工商业贷款折实储蓄，贸易公司举办配售棉纱、收购成品、帮助私营机器手工业恢复生产等，都有成绩。截至九月底为止，土布业恢复的户数已等于解放前六倍多，针织业恢复户数比解放前增加百分之二十八，染织业恢复户数比解放前增加百分之九十。至于职工薪资问题，在开始时我们是采取暂借办法，在执行中对继续在开工的工厂也未加以区别，而机械地一律采取此一平均主义办法，其结果则引起了一部分职工情绪低落，生产立时降低的现象。但在九月份，我们对已复工的企业即采取了原职原薪的措施，对于复工或半复工生产单位实行正式发给薪资，未复工的生产单位则发给维持费，以促使各企业均能迅速全部恢复生产。现在财政经济方面的移交清点工作已基本结束，今后工作的中心则是转到组织工人阶级，改进生产与企业的管理，以达到实行经济核算制，提高产量质量与降低成本。
    （四）交通接管工作
    接管大小单位一百余个，员工约一万五千人。铁路被白匪破坏很重，许多桥梁都被炸毁，而职工则因人多与业务未展开，致生活极端困苦，但工人们情绪很高，克服了无数困难，获得很大成绩。公路的恢复更快。其他电讯、邮政等方面接收时大体完整无损，现在各项业务很快即可全部恢复。
    （五）文化教育接管工作
    接管步骤是先接管报馆及文化机关，然后接管公立学校，对于私立学校则保持原来状态。在学校中采取的是缓慢改进的办法，反动的训导制度及反动的公民、历史等课程则立即取消，其他课程暂时保持不变，但增加新的政治课程。
    （六）组织领导方面
    在组织领导上，军管会采取了稳重的政策。在布置接管中，首先是干部事先很好地调查研究，了解情况，学习政策方针。使用干部时则采取少而精的原则。
    王首道最后在谈到今后建设人民的新长沙的方针时说：目前的长沙基本上是一个商业的消费的城市。在企业总数目中，工业约占百分之二十一（铁路在外），商业则占百分之七十九；在公私比重上，公营约占百分之十，私营约占百分之九十。在私营企业中，绝大多数是手工业。交通运输尚未完全恢复，城乡之间的贸易交流还正在开始。因此在建设新长沙的工作中，在一定时期内还要以恢复和发展商业和交通运输为重点。同时，长沙又是一个内地的城市，它的存在和发展主要依靠农村，因此为了发展城市的商业和工业，必须首先活跃农村的经济，提高农民的购买力。目前，在全省范围来说，征收公粮、保证大军的供应和财政供给是当前一切工作的重心。由于这些情况，所以我们目前的工作重点应该放在农村，进行剿匪、建立地方武装、反对首要恶霸与坏乡保甲人员，实行合理负担，减租减息，以便逐渐地有步骤地转到实施土地改革，然后再将工作重点移向城市。
