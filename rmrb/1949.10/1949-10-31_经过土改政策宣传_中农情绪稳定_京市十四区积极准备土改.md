　　After Land Reform Policy Publicity,
    Middle Peasants' Emotions Stabilize;
    14 Districts in Beijing Actively Prepare for Land Reform
    [Report from our newspaper] During the period of the farmers' representative meeting in the 14 districts of Beijing's southern suburbs, which was held to prepare for the implementation of land reform, some middle peasants were uneasy because they did not understand the government's land reform policy and feared that their land would be divided. Some even went to the farmers' association representatives to voluntarily request to "donate land." In response to this specific situation, the working group cadres in the district immediately used various forms, such as large and small meetings, to conduct in-depth publicity of the land reform policy to the peasants, pointing out that middle and poor peasants are one family, and firmly assuring that the land of middle peasants would not be touched. After the continuous efforts of all the cadres for several days, the emotions of the middle peasants have stabilized. Guo Peitian, a middle peasant in Shibalidian, said: "Since the middle peasants are not touched, I will quickly seize the time to plant one more mu of wheat." Poor peasant Liu Defu said: "We, the middle and poor peasants, are one family, let's unite and reason with the landlords." The middle peasants of Chengshou Temple Village unanimously stated: "Let's hurry up and harvest the cabbages, so we can do land reform after the harvest." At the moment, the cadres in the district are carrying out further publicity and education to consolidate the unity of poor, hired, and middle peasants.

　　经过土改政策宣传　
    中农情绪稳定　
    京市十四区积极准备土改
    【本报讯】京市南郊十四区在开农民代表会议准备实施土地改革期间，部分中农因对政府土改政策不了解，怕分掉土地，情绪不安，有的甚至找农会代表自动要求“献地”。该区工作组干部针对具体情况，马上利用大会、小会各种形式，深入农民展开宣传土改政策，指出中贫农是一家，坚决不动中农土地。经过全体干部连日努力，中农情绪已趋安定。十八里店中农郭培天说：“中农不动，我快抓紧多种一亩麦。”贫农刘德孚说：“咱们中贫农是一家，团结起来和地主说理。”成寿祠村的中农一致表示：“快收白菜吧，收完了好做土改。”刻该区干部正在作更进一步的宣传教育，把贫雇中农团结得更巩固。
