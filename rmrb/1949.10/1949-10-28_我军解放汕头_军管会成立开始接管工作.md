　　Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 27th: The city of Shantou, Guangdong's second-largest city with a population of over 200,000, was declared liberated on the 24th, and the Chao-Shan region is now completely liberated. Before fleeing, the remnant bandit troops entrenched in the Chao-Shan area carried out a frenzied looting and attempted to destroy water, electricity, telecommunications, bridges, etc. However, thanks to the heroic protection of the workers, except for the automatic telephone exchange and a part of the airport which were destroyed, the rest did not suffer serious damage. When the People's Liberation Army entered the city at 1:30 PM on the 24th, the citizens, who had suffered under the ravages of the Chiang bandits, held high the five-star national flag and large portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, lining the streets to welcome them. The cheers of "Long Live Chairman Mao!" and "Long Live the People's Liberation Army!" were endless, creating an unprecedented scene. Shops immediately opened for business, schools resumed classes, and water and electricity were supplied as usual. Revolutionary order has been quickly established in the city. The Shantou Military Control Commission has been established, with Lin Meinan as the director and Li Ping and Wu Nansheng as deputy directors. Various takeover tasks have begun. The Unity Daily, which persisted in the struggle in the South China guerrilla base area for two years, was also published in Shantou on the 25th and was extremely popular with the citizens.

    军管会成立开始接管工作
    【新华社华南前线二十七日电】拥有二十余万人口的广东第二大城汕头市已于二十四日宣告解放，潮汕地区也完全解放。盘据潮汕地区残余匪军逃跑前曾进行疯狂劫掠，并企图破坏水电、电讯、桥梁等，但由于职工们的英勇保护，除电讯局自动电话所及飞机场一部被毁外，其他均未遭受严重破坏。人民解放军二十四日下午一时半进入市区时，饱受蒋匪蹂躏的市民高举五星国旗及毛主席、朱总司令大幅画像夹道欢迎，“毛主席万岁！”“人民解放军万岁！”的欢呼声不绝于耳，盛况空前。商店立即开门营业，学校恢复上课，水电亦照常供应，市内革命秩序已迅速建立。汕头市军管会已宣告成立，林美南为主任，李平、吴南生为副主任。各项接管工作已开始进行。在华南游击根据地坚持了二年斗争的团结报亦于二十五日在汕出版，极受市民欢迎。
