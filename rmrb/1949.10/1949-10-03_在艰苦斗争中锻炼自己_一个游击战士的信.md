A Guerrilla Fighter's Letter

Sister:
It's been almost four years since we parted, and nearly two years since I left our parents! Although I am now in a liberated area, I haven't had time to report to you in detail about my struggles over the past year. For now, I'll give you a general overview:

Last June, after finishing my graduation exams, I decided to abandon my plans to take the university entrance exam and resolutely joined the revolutionary struggle. At that time, although I had read some revolutionary theory books, my understanding of the revolution was still somewhat vague. It was merely that witnessing the broken reality made me feel that "a thorough revolution is essential." On July 2nd, I went from Fuzhou to Nanping. The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party, which was holding out behind enemy lines, was there. So, several classmates and I who went up the mountain together were immediately assigned to villages to do mass work. We abandoned our "refined" habits and lived with the farmers, leading the masses in the distribution of grain and the struggle against local bullies, and launching a "clear the fields" campaign against the enemy to resist their "encirclement and suppression."

After participating in various practical struggles, I experienced the great power of the masses, something we could never have imagined in school.

After three months, I joined the guerrilla force. After countless battles, witnessing the bloodshed and sacrifice of many comrades…; climbing countless high mountains and steep ridges; walking all night until dawn, groping forward in the dark thorns; the colder it was, the more often we had to wade into the water to cross rivers or ditches; sometimes hiding in the water for long periods. In winter, it was too cold to sleep, so we would get up to burn weeds to make a fire, or five or six people would share a thin blanket, huddling together to sleep. We often had to make one full meal last for several days, and sometimes we had to fight the enemy when we were extremely hungry. Sister, during this period, I wavered, I cried. I thought, if I didn't participate in the revolution, my family would still have food for me to eat, so why should I "suffer" like this!? But then I thought: only by enduring such hardships can intellectuals temper themselves and become strong; only by resolutely walking with the working people can we find our way out. In such a difficult life, we also more deeply experienced the suffering and greatness of the working people, making us respect them even more and learn from them. So, gradually, I became firm! I threw away all the messy thoughts and was left with only one belief – "Serve the people." Under this general direction and goal, every matter and every action should be carried out in accordance with this principle.

Our guerrilla force victoriously joined forces with the Second Field Army on May 20th when Jianyang was liberated. At that time, we finally took off our black and smelly clothes, put on yellow military uniforms, put our tattered rifles into storage, and replaced them with newly captured American guns, and began to learn regularization from the Field Army. Sister! What an exciting thing this was! Especially for the people who had been ravaged by the enemy countless times, they were simply excited to the point of madness!…

Your brother, Yinghui, August 27th in Shaowu

### 在艰苦斗争中锻炼自己 　一个游击战士的信

　　在艰苦斗争中锻炼自己
   　一个游击战士的信姐姐：
    和你分别快四年，离开父母也快二年了！虽然我现在已经在解放的地区，可是还没有时间详细报告你们我这一年斗争中的情形，现在，只讲个大概吧：
    去年六月考完了毕业大考后，我决定放弃了考大学的计划，毅然参加到革命斗争中。那时候我虽已读了些革命理论的书，可是对革命的认识还是有些模糊的，仅仅是目睹破烂的现实觉得有“非彻底革命不可”的一个概念。七月二日我从福州到南平，那时候坚持敌后的福建共产党省委在那儿，于是和我一起上山的几个同学立刻被分发到乡村中去做群众工作。我们丢弃了“文雅”习惯，和农民们生活在一起，领导群众进行分粮与恶霸斗争，并发动“空室清野”的对敌斗争，以抵抗敌人的“进剿”。
    我参加了种种实际的斗争之后，体验到了群众伟大的力量，这是我们在学校里决想象不到的事物。
    过了三个月，我便参加了游击队。经过了无数次的打仗，眼见着许多同志的流血、牺牲…；爬过了多少的高山峻岭；晚间一夜走到天亮，在黑的荆棘中摸索前进，愈是寒冷，愈会遇着要浸到水里去渡过河或过沟；有时候长时间的浸在水里隐蔽。冬天冷得不能睡觉，爬起来烧野草烤火，或者五六个人合盖一条薄薄的毯子，大家互拥着睡觉。我们常常吃一顿饱的就要管上几天，甚至在非常饥饿时，还要和敌人打仗。姐姐，在这个时期，我动摇过，我哭过。我想，我不参加革命，家里也有一口饭给我吃，我为什么要这样“受罪”呀！？但是，回过来一想：知识分子只有吃这样的苦，才能把自己锻炼得坚强起来；只能坚决地跟劳动人民群众一起走，才是自己的出路。在这样艰苦的生活下，也使我们更体会到劳动人们的痛苦和伟大，使我们更尊重他们，向他们学习。所以，慢慢地，我便坚定下来了！把一切乱七八糟的想头一起丢开，只剩下一个信念存在——“为人民服务”。在这一个总的方向与目标下，任何事情，任何行动都应该服从这一个原则去执行。
    我们这一支游击队，是在五月二十日于建阳解放时和二野部队胜利会师的。那时，我们才把黑而臭的衣服脱下，换上黄军装，把破烂的步枪放入仓库，换上新缴来的美式枪，并向野战军学习正规化。姐姐！这是多么令人兴奋的事呵！尤其是受过敌人无数次摧残的人民，他们简直兴奋得象疯狂了！………。
    弟应恢八月二十七日于邵武
