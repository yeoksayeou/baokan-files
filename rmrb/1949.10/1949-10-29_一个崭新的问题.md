　　A Brand New Question
    Peng Shuyu
    I saw four drawings submitted to the Beijing Children's Publishing House by a sixth-grade student, with the theme of student council elections. One depicted a wall covered with campaign slogans, with someone shouting "Vote for ××!"; another showed many people listening to someone standing on a step speaking, seemingly giving a campaign speech; one showed students voting; and the last depicted several people standing on a step with many people standing below, generally celebrating the election of a classmate. At first glance, these drawings seemed completely uninteresting, and the technique was poor. It was impossible to distinguish adults from children, men from women, and some small circles were randomly drawn to represent a crowd of people. What was commendable about this? But on closer reflection, especially when comparing these drawings to those I made in elementary school, it was truly astonishing! In just ten years, children's thinking has undergone a significant and immeasurable change; perhaps even less than ten years, maybe just a year ago, elementary school students probably wouldn't have drawn such pictures, right?

    In the past, elementary school students often drew lifeless still lifes, like bottles and fruits. Older students might draw natural landscapes. When students drew, they were merely copying, without putting their hearts into it, and the drawings had no meaning. They were simply practicing how to draw something so that people could recognize what it was, or practicing using lines to represent light and shadow; then there was practice in color matching. Obviously, teaching elementary school students drawing in this way was, in effect, leading them down the road of "art for art's sake." I do not deny that elementary school students need these exercises, but taking this as the main method or main purpose of teaching elementary school students drawing would cause children to lose their appreciation and understanding of the ideological nature of art—the true value of art—from an early age. This method is not effective in inspiring children's thinking development and strengthening children's ideological education today. Therefore, the facts mentioned above pose a brand new question for art teachers in elementary schools and comrades concerned about children's art education.

    Today's elementary school students have progressed so quickly that they not only care about what happens around them, but also are extremely willing to express their concern and love for these things through drawings or words. They hope to publish matters that are related to themselves and that they feel are of great significance to all elementary school students in their own newspapers, introducing them to all elementary school students. Thus, regardless of their abilities, they put this hope into practice. From the facts mentioned above, we not only see that children's thinking is progressing and that they have developed a love for new things, but also, in terms of the meaning of art, this student's approach demonstrates that he is taking the correct artistic path. Drawing on valuable materials from real life that relate to everyone striving for a better future, creating artistic works with rich ideological content. Although today, his understanding of this is not yet clear, and he is not doing it well enough, it is precisely this point that elementary school teachers who are cultivating new Chinese children—construction talent for the new China—should pay attention to, paying attention to children's ideological development, and in practical education, gradually establishing correct artistic ideas in children's minds.

    Of course, there are many difficulties in doing this work well. Take this student's drawings, for example. How should they be revised? The drawing is so simple, but the content it contains is very rich. It is difficult for teachers to improve students' drawing abilities gradually by revising the student's original drawings based on their existing foundation. Even teachers may find it difficult to have the confidence to draw a good picture of an elementary school student giving a campaign speech. Because this is something new, students can't draw it well, and teachers haven't drawn it before either. Most of the things that most teachers have learned and drawn before were bottles, fruits, natural landscapes, models, and the like, right? Who has drawn something like elementary school students electing their own student council? This is exactly what Chairman Mao said: "Some of the things we are familiar with are about to become idle, and some of the things we are not familiar with are forcing us to do." Furthermore: how can all children be inspired to have this kind of thinking and do this kind of thing? What kind of elementary school art teaching materials are suitable for children who are so ideologically advanced but still have low drawing skills today? These are all things that need to be studied. Today, we do not yet have enough experience, and we cannot say specific and effective solutions, but we must pay attention to this problem and find a way to solve this problem through learning and research. Chairman Mao said: "We must overcome difficulties, we must learn things we do not understand." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, I firmly believe that we will succeed.

　　一个崭新的问题
    彭树宇
    我看到一个小学六年级的学生投给北京儿童社的四幅画稿，画题是学生会选举。一幅画着一面墙上贴满了竞选标语，旁边有人在喊“选××”；一幅是画着许多人在听一个站在台阶上的人讲话，看样子是在发表竞选演说；一幅画的是学生们在投票；另一幅则是几个人站在台阶上很多人站在下面，大意是在庆贺当选的同学。这些画，乍看起来，真是毫无趣味，而且技术也不好，既看不出大人、小孩、男人、女人的区别，而且乱画些小圆圈代表一群人，这有什么可取的地方呢？可是我仔细想想，尤其想起我在小学时的画和这些画比较起来，真太令人惊奇了！仅只十年的光景，儿童的思想已经明显的有了不可衡量的大变化；也许不到十年，就是一年前，小学的学生恐怕也不会画出这样的画吧？
    从前的小学生，经常都是画些无生命的静物，象瓶子水果一类的东西，高年级的学生也不过画些自然风景。学生们在画的时候，是比葫芦画瓢，不用心去想，画出来也没有什么意义，只是练习了如何把一种东西画的能让人看出来是什么东西，或是练习用线条表示出明阴；再有便是练习配色。很明显的，仅只这样教小学生的绘画，无形间是要把学生们引上“为艺术而艺术”的道路上去的。我不否认小学生需要这些练习，但拿这作为教小学生绘画的主要方法或主要目的，就会使儿童们从小就失去了对艺术的思想性——艺术的真价的体会与认识。这种方法，在今天要启发儿童们的思想发展，加强儿童们的思想教育是收不到应有的效果的。所以，前面谈的事实，是给现在小学校的美术先生和关心儿童们的艺术教育的同志们提出了一个崭新的问题。
    现在的小学生已经进步得这样快，他们不但关心发生在自己周围的事情，而且极愿用图画或文字表示出他们对这些事情的关心与热爱。他们希望把与自己有关系的，而且他们感觉对所有小学生都有重大意义的事情，在他们自己的报纸上发表出来，向所有的小学生们介绍。于是他们不管自己的能力如何，便把这种希望实行了。从上面谈的事实中，我们不但看到了儿童们的思想已在进步，对新鲜事物已发生了热爱，而且在艺术的意义上说，这位同学的做法，是说明了他要走的是正确的艺术道路。从现实的生活中，提出对大家为美好的未来而斗争的有价值的材料，作出有丰富的思想性的艺术作品。虽然在今天，他的思想上对这种认识还不明确，而且做的还不好，但对一个培养新中国的儿童——新中国的建设人材的小学教师说，正是应当注意这点，注意儿童们的思想发展，并在实际的教育中，把正确的艺术思想，逐渐地树立在儿童们的思想中。
    当然，要把这种工作做好，还有许多困难。就拿对这位同学的几幅画说吧。怎样改呢？画的那样简单，但包含的内容却很丰富。先生们很难就学生原有的画的基础改一下，使学生的绘画能力因而逐渐提高，就是先生们恐怕也很难有把握画好一个发表竞选演说的小学生。因为这是新的东西，学生们画不好，先生们以前也没有画过。多数的先生们以前学的、画的，不也是瓶子水果自然风景模特儿一类的东西吗？谁画过小学生选举他们自己的学生会一类的东西呢？这正是毛主席说的：“我们熟悉的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟悉的东西正在强迫我们去做。”再说：怎样启发所有的儿童们都有这种思想并且这样做呢？今天要有什么样的小学美术教材才适合象今天这样的思想进步但绘画技术还很低的儿童们呢？这些都是需要研究的。在今天，我们还没有足够的经验，还说不出具体而有效的解决办法，但我们必须注意这个问题，从学习研究中找出能解决这个问题的办法。毛主席说：“我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。”照着毛主席这个指示走，我坚信一定会成功的。
