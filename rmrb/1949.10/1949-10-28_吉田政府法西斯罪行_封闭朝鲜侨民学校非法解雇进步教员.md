　　Yoshida Government's Fascist Crimes
　　Illegally Closing Korean Resident Schools and Unlawfully Dismissing Progressive Teachers
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 27th] The Korean Central News Agency, citing an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 22nd, reported that after the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan ordered the dissolution of the democratic League of Korean Residents in Japan on September 8th, it illegally closed more than 260 Korean resident schools on October 19th and confiscated their properties, leaving over 47,000 students in these schools suddenly without education. This illegal action by the Yoshida government has aroused strong protests from the people of Japan and Korea. However, the Syngman Rhee puppet government of South Korea, in order to plunder the properties of Korean resident schools in Japan, did not hesitate to collude with the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. It instructed Zheng Huanfan, its puppet "special envoy" stationed in Japan, to once again request Paul Sebald, Director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of MacArthur Headquarters, to hand over the properties of the closed Korean resident schools to the puppet government when he received reporters on the 21st.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th] Tokyo dispatch: The reactionary Yoshida government is continuing to implement Fascist-style "purges" in educational institutions across Japan. The Osaka Education Bureau "advised 84 teachers to resign" on the 22nd, on the grounds that they "do not comply with the teacher regulations." According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch on the 23rd, about 4,000 teachers across Japan are currently slated for dismissal due to their communist leanings. Previously, it was reported that 2,000 teachers had already been dismissed across Japan. A Tokyo correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor admitted: "The Japanese government is not only purging communists, but also purging all progressive and liberal elements who oppose the current government's policies and actions."
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th] Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese parliament convened its sixth special session since the war on the morning of the 25th. The main topics of discussion at the meeting are the "tax reform plan" proposed by Shoup, head of the U.S. tax delegation, and the "revised budget proposal" put forward by Dodge, MacArthur's financial advisor and an American banker. The session is expected to last 30 days, but the discussion of the main topics will be postponed until November, as Dodge, who is "famous in Japan for tightening belts" (United Press), will not be able to return to Japan from the United States until the end of this month.
　　The Japanese Communist Party's organ, Akahata, commented on the Japanese parliament's special session on the 25th, saying: The Japanese people cannot expect this meeting to produce anything beneficial to the people. The Japanese people must carry out organized struggle: overthrow the Yoshida cabinet and pave the way for a people's government. The newspaper pointed out that this is the path for the Japanese people to achieve genuine peace and independence.

　　吉田政府法西斯罪行　
    封闭朝鲜侨民学校非法解雇进步教员
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】朝鲜中央通讯社引述美联社东京二十二日消息，日本吉田反动政府继九月八日下令解散民主的旅日朝鲜侨民团体之后，又于十月十九日非法封闭朝鲜侨民的学校二百六十余所，并将其财产没收，使这些学校中的四万七千余名学生，顿时失学。吉田政府的这一非法行动，引起了日本与朝鲜人民的强烈抗议。但南朝鲜的李承晚卖国政府，为了掠夺旅日朝鲜侨民学校的财产，竟不惜勾结美日反动派，吩咐驻日本的伪“特使”郑桓范在二十一日招待记者时，再度要求麦克阿瑟总部外事局局长赛鲍尔将被封闭的朝鲜侨民学校的财产交给伪政府。
    【新华社北京二十七日电】东京消息：吉田反动政府正继续在日本全国各地教育机关中实行法西斯式的“清洗”。大坂教育局已于二十二日“劝告八十四名教员辞职”，理由是他们“不符合教员条例”。据法新社二十三日讯，日本各地目前有教员约四千名，因有共产党倾向而预定要被解聘。前此，该社会报道日本各地已有两千名教员被解聘。美国基督教科学箴言报驻东京记者承认：“日本政府不仅进行清除共产党人，并且要清除一切反对现政府政策与行动的进步分子与自由主义分子。”
    【新华社北京二十七日电】东京消息，日本议会于二十五日上午召开战后第六次的特别会议。会议讨论的主要议题是美国税务代表团团长萧普所提出的“税收改革计划”及麦克阿瑟财政顾问、美国银行家道奇所提出的“修改预算方案”。会期预计历时三十日，但主要议题的讨论，将延至十一月，因为以“紧缩肚带而在日本驰名”（合众社）的道奇，须至本月底始能由美返回日本。
    日共机关报赤旗报二十五日在评论日本议会的这次特别会议时称：日本人民不能期望这次会议能作出任何有益于人民的事情。日本人民必须进行有组织的斗争：推翻吉田内阁，并为人民政府开辟道路。该报指出，这是日本人民走向真正和平与独立的道路。
