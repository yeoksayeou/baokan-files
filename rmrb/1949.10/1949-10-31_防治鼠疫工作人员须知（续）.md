Chapter Two: Important Information for On-site Epidemic Prevention Work
I. Personnel and Tasks of the Epidemic Prevention Team
The epidemic prevention team consists of: 1. Physicians, 2. Epidemic prevention personnel, 3. Nurses, and 4. Local public security administrative personnel, each with a certain number of people. Their tasks are: 1. Investigate and study the epidemic area's situation, customs, habits, climate, geology, etc.; 2. Quarantine (examine patients); 3. Disinfection; 4. Preventive injections; 5. Dissect corpses for bacterial examination; 6. Information, propaganda, relief (food, fuel, water, etc.); 7. Catch rats and kill fleas, handle corpses, isolate and accommodate and treat patients; 8. Record statistics.
II. Preparations Before the Epidemic Prevention Team Departs
A. Items to Carry: (1) Items carried personally: 1. Woolen products such as felt, woolen clothes, fur, etc., which are easy to harbor fleas, should not be carried unless absolutely necessary; 2. Clothes and luggage with darker colors should not be carried; it is best to use white or light colors that are easy to spot fleas.
(2) Public Items: 1. Equipment: Spray disinfectors, syringes and needles (5CC is preferred), puncture needles, surgical instruments (only for lymph node removal), dissecting instruments (for dissecting corpses), thermometers (more should be prepared), thermometers, hygrometers, alcohol lamps, platinum loops, microscopes, specimen forceps, miscellaneous forceps, rat catching tongs, rat traps, corpse lifting troughs (the inside is best lined with tinplate for disinfection), large iron drums (for steam disinfection), protective clothing (separate top and bottom, plus socks, headgear, and long cloth gloves), rubber boots, rubber gloves, glasses, sleeping bags (three feet wide and six feet long), masks (twelve layers of gauze). 2. Medicines: Cresol Lysol, carbolic acid, formalin, potassium permanganate (for gargling), mercurochrome (220), alcohol, lime, sulfur, iodine, rat poison, sulfa drugs (powder, tablets, and injections are all acceptable, but injections are faster and more effective). 3. Consumables: Gauze, cotton, bandages, sterile petri dishes (Culture Dish), sterile test tubes, staining solutions (various), cedar oil, XYOL, glass slides, filter paper, matches, waste paper, white flour or other substitutes (for making paste to seal, for sealing doors and windows during disinfection), carbide lamps and carbide or candles, etc. 4. Office Supplies: Stationery (general), patient log, work log, injection certificate, seals, handouts, various attachments.
All of the above items must be prepared properly before departure. When packing and loading, pay attention to moisture and rain protection, prevent damage, and assign special personnel to be responsible for the safekeeping of all items.
B. How to Wear Protective Clothing:
The order of dressing is as follows: 1. Pants, 2. Socks, 3. Protective boots, 4. Top, 5. Mouth cover (Mask), 6. Hat, 7. Glasses, 8. Protective gloves.
When wearing protective clothing, be sure to pay attention to the zippers and ties to ensure they are properly fastened, leaving no gaps to prevent fleas from entering.
III. Precautions During the Epidemic Prevention Team's Journey
(1) Before boarding the vehicle, the person in charge of managing the items should check all the items carried and then move them in in order. All glass appliances, disinfectors, microscopes, staining solutions and other valuable and easily broken items should be placed separately, and other items should not be piled on top of them or people sitting or lying on them. (2) If any items are found to be lost or damaged en route, report them immediately so that appropriate measures can be taken. (3) Maintain group hygiene during the journey. (4) Act consistently and do not act alone. (5) Maintain gastrointestinal health and do not drink raw water or overeat. (6) Get enough sleep and do not overwork. (7) If any patients or unhealthy individuals are found in the group, report them promptly and handle them properly. (8) Prevent and kill fleas.
IV. Things to Note Near the Epidemic Area
(1) Check whether all personnel are healthy. (2) Check the items carried to see if any are lost or damaged. (3) Check whether the protective clothing is properly worn. (4) Collect accurate information about the epidemic area. (5) Choose a place to live for the epidemic prevention team.
V. Method of Choosing a Place to Live
(1) It must be a place close to the epidemic area for easy access. (2) It must be a village or house that is definitely free of plague. (3) The location should be high and convenient for transportation (because there are more fleas in low-lying areas). (4) The house should be far away from other houses and easy to dig trenches to prevent rats from entering from outside. (5) The exit and access road must not pass through other people's homes or courtyards but lead directly to the main road to avoid spreading germs and infecting others when returning from work. (6) It is easier to get water and fuel, and it is best to have a well in the yard. (7) It is close to the local government or public security agency for easy communication and contact. (8) The house is newly built or better built and easy to disinfect. It is better if there is a loft in the house (to prevent fleas).
VI. Method of Choosing a Changing and Disinfection Area (Room) for the Epidemic Prevention Team
(1) When choosing a residence, the conditions of the changing and disinfection area must be considered.
The conditions for selection are as follows: 1. It must be close to the residence, with a distance of about 15 to 30 meters between the two. 2. A ditch should be separated between the changing and disinfection area and the residence, and a wooden board should be built as a bridge for access. There should be open space in front and on both sides for washing clothes, drying clothes, and steam disinfecting protective clothing. 3. Easy access to water and fuel. 4. If there is no house, a mat shed can be built. 5. The changing and disinfection area should have the following parts:
(2) Undressing Room: After returning from outside, the contaminated protective clothing should be strictly disinfected with a sprayer, and then removed into the disinfection tank (10% CRESOL for more than half an hour), and then washed with clean water.
(3) Disinfection Room: Wash your hands, gargle, and then spray the clothes worn inside with disinfectant.
(4) Changing Room (Clean Clothes).
(5) Laundry Area.
(6) Steam Disinfection Area.
VII. How to Tidy Up the Epidemic Prevention Team's Residence
1. First move out unnecessary items in the house (such as boxes and cabinets). 2. Order the original residents to move to another appropriate place. 3. Move all the items around the house to expose rat holes and make it easy to find rat holes. 4. Block rat holes. Fill the rat holes with small ash and thin wooden sticks, and then press them firmly with stones or brick adobe. 5. Move the reed mats and hay to the outside of the house. After knocking the reed mats, spray them with 5% Cresol Lysol for disinfection, spray them inside and out, and place them on a rope to dry. Burn the hay. 6. Spray the inside of the house and the ground with 5% carbolic acid water for disinfection until wet. 7. Thoroughly clean the inside of the house and the ground once. 8. Then spray it again with Cresol Lysol ash for disinfection. 9. Then spread lime all over the inside of the house and the ground until no black ground is visible. 10. Move the reed mats in and spread them on the heated brick bed (kang), and then move the luggage and items in (clean and tidy up before moving in). 11. Sprinkle more flea-killing medicines such as pyrethrum powder or DDT around the heated brick bed and along the edge of the heated brick bed. 12. Fold the sleeping bag and press it under the quilt to prevent fleas from entering. 13. If lime is lacking, small ash can be used instead (hot small ash is best). 14. Before going to bed every day, lime must be sprinkled all over the house.
(To be continued)
Maximum temperature 14.4 degrees (15:25); minimum temperature 1.06 degrees (7:10). The weather will be sunny and cloudy within 24 hours from 18:00 on the 30th; the wind will change from southwest to northwest; the wind force will change from weak to moderate; the temperature will not change much.
