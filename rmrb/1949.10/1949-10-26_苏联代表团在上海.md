　　The Soviet Delegation in Shanghai
    Our Shanghai correspondent Chao Qi

    Upon hearing the news that the Soviet delegation was leaving Beijing for Shanghai, the people of Shanghai were jubilant and excited, and immediately prepared a grand welcome. Forty-four technicians from the Shanghai Film Studio built a magnificent and beautiful open-air stage, the likes of which Shanghai had never seen, in seventeen hours. On this stage, the Soviet art performance team performed art that was unanimously praised by the people of Shanghai.
    During its five-day stay in Shanghai, the Soviet delegation participated in as many as eighteen welcome rallies, lectures, symposiums, and commemorative meetings with people from all walks of life in Shanghai, and visited many factories, making extensive contact with people from all walks of life in Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 15th, the delegation attended the welcome meeting of representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 16th, Simonov spoke to young students at the Great Light Cinema about several issues for Soviet cultural workers. The thirty-three-year-old Simonov, together with more than two thousand young people, smiled as if he were talking to his younger siblings; on behalf of the Soviet youth, he sincerely hoped for the success of Shanghai and all Chinese students in their studies and work, so as to benefit the great Chinese people. In the evening, the delegation attended the Sino-Soviet friendship party at the Yiyuan Garden with over ten thousand people, which was a great gathering full of international friendship. When the delegation entered the venue, thousands of heads surged below the stage, and forest-like arms waved in the air, with many people shedding tears of excitement.
    In order to introduce the Soviet experience in a more systematic way, the delegation was invited to attend lectures and symposiums of various circles in Shanghai on the 17th and 18th.
    At every mass rally, the Soviet delegation cheered for the Chinese people, especially the working class, and for the heroic and invincible People's Liberation Army more than once. They said: They felt extremely honored and proud to be able to meet the working-class brothers and the People's Liberation Army in liberated Shanghai and China. On the evening of the 17th, at the welcome rally of over ten thousand workers, Deomidov recounted the history of the Shanghai workers' struggle; Stoletov raised his fist and solemnly assured the workers that all the Soviet people stood with them in their heroic struggle to win the happiness of the Chinese people and strive for the prosperity of industry, agriculture and culture. Markov, on behalf of the Soviet people, welcomed the Chinese worker brothers to the Soviet Union as honored guests. The comrades of the art performance team said that they were excited because they could perform for the workers. Minaev, a member of the Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble, injured his wrist during a performance in Beijing. After arriving in Shanghai, the doctor repeatedly advised him not to perform, but that night he insisted on continuing to perform. He said: In order for the Shanghai workers to see the Red Army dance, even if his arm became disabled in the future, he would still be very happy. The cheers at the venue were like the roar of the sea, and everyone was deeply moved by this great international friendship of the international friends. After the meeting, Chen Zongzhi of the telephone company said: I participated in this great evening party and felt cordial and happy all the time. The Soviet friends clapped and cheered with us, and it was impossible to tell who were the hosts and who were the guests. The friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union was completely integrated.
    Simonov was very concerned about the work and life of the workers. On the 18th and 19th, he and Dubrovina visited factories such as China Textile and China Machinery amidst their busy schedules. He was warmly welcomed by the workers. At the symposiums in the factories, he listened carefully to the workers' stories about their past struggles against the reactionaries. He inquired in detail about the trade union organizations, cultural and recreational activities, workers' families, and even how single men cooked, and the facilities of workers' dining rooms and bathhouses in the factories. All the conversations were recorded by her secretary with a typewriter as valuable material for writing about Chinese workers in the future. When he introduced the life of Soviet workers, he said that Soviet workers are workers on the one hand and college students on the other. He himself is one of them. The Chinese workers said in unison: "We are working hard to learn from you!" The workers saw the bright future of the new China. Before leaving, he happily took a group photo with the workers of China Textile Factory No. 12 as a permanent memorial of their first meeting.
    "These people – the People's Liberation Army – are also cultural workers in our eyes!" This is how the Soviet delegation understands the Chinese People's Liberation Army. On the evening of the 18th, the delegation was very happy to attend the welcome meeting of the Shanghai Garrison of the Third Field Army. In front of more than ten thousand commanders and soldiers, Simonov cheered "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" with the most excited mood! When Simonov described that the news that the Chinese People's Liberation Army victoriously crossed the Yangtze River and liberated Nanjing reached the venue of the World Congress for the Defense of Peace in Prague, the entire audience celebrated wildly for half an hour. The whole audience burst into thunderous applause that lasted for a long time. This was an extraordinary welcome meeting. Before the representatives of the People's Liberation Army presented flowers and commemorative medals of the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign to the delegation, Guo Huaruo introduced the heroic deeds of the eighteen combat heroes headed by Wei Laiguo, a representative of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, one by one. When the eighteen people's heroes walked up to the representatives with flowers and medals and hung the medals on the chests of the delegation, Simonov tightly embraced Wei Laiguo, expressing his high respect for the people's heroes.
    The 19th was the thirteenth anniversary of the death of Mr. Lu Xun, the revolutionary literary giant who loved the people and loved the Soviet Union. On the morning of that day, the Soviet delegation, led by Simonov, laid flowers on Lu Xun's tomb. With a heavy heart, Simonov briefly addressed Lu Xun's tomb, saying: The Soviet people gratefully and forever remember Mr. Lu Xun's friendship with the Soviet Union. And they are willing to guarantee that Lu Xun's works, which already enjoy a wide reputation in the Soviet Union, will soon become the property of all the people of their motherland. At about eleven o'clock, Simonov also attended the Shanghai representatives' conference commemorating Mr. Lu Xun.
    Our international friends went north with the friendship of the people of Shanghai on the evening of the 19th. The people of Shanghai were still reluctant to leave. On the afternoon of the 19th, at the cocktail party to bid farewell to the delegation, a Chinese-Russian slogan was hung: "Welcome you to come to China again!" This is what every Chinese person wants to say in their hearts.
    At the cocktail party with more than 300 people, clusters of people were clinking glasses, telling endless stories of friendship. Rao Shushi, Zeng Shan, and Pan Hannian were searching for Soviet friends one by one in the crowd to clink glasses. People toasted Marshal Stalin, toasted Chairman Mao Zedong, toasted farewell, and toasted the hope of meeting again soon.
    Rao Shushi, on behalf of the people of East China and Shanghai, entrusted the delegation to bring Marshal Stalin several packages of specialties from the working people of East China. People from all walks of life in Shanghai also presented various specialties to the delegation and the performance team to thank them for their visit. In his thank-you speech, Stoletov said: Your warm hospitality to us has left an indelible memory in our hearts! Yes, this is a manifestation of precious and great international friendship. Rao Shushi repeatedly wished the Soviet friends a safe journey! At 6:50, the representatives arrived at the station, and people from all walks of life who came to see them off at the square issued endless cheers. A dozen blazing torches on the station gate were jumping, and people's hearts were also jumping. Accompanied by Rao Shushi, the Soviet friends stepped onto the platform illuminated by mercury lamps, and representatives from all walks of life shook hands with their friends to say goodbye. Simonov got on the train, then got off again and shook hands with the senders off one more time. When the band played "March of the Motherland," everyone sang along, Simonov sang, Rao Shushi sang; those who could sing all sang, and the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people was completely integrated into the singing.

　　苏联代表团在上海
    本报驻上海记者  超祺
    上海人民听到苏联代表团离京来沪的消息，欢腾兴奋，立即准备盛大的欢迎。上海电影厂四十四个技术工人，在十七小时内建造了上海从未有过的堂皇漂亮的露天舞台。在这个舞台上，苏联艺术演出队表演了获得上海人民一致赞美的艺术。
    苏联代表团留沪五天，先后参加了各界欢迎会、讲演会、座谈会、纪念会达十八次之多，并参观了许多工厂，广泛地接触了上海市各阶层的人民。十五日下午，代表团出席上海各界人民代表的欢迎会，十六日下午西蒙诺夫在大光明对青年学生谈苏联文化工作者的几个问题。三十三岁的西蒙诺夫和两千多青年人在一起，他微笑着，好象对自己的弟妹们谈家常一样；他代表苏联青年衷心希望上海和全中国青年学生在学业和工作中的成功，来为伟大的中国人民谋福利。晚上代表团出席逸园万余人的中苏联欢晚会，这是一个充满了国际友爱的大会。当代表团进入会场时，台下万头钻动，森林似的手臂在空中挥动着，不少人激动得落下热泪。
    为了比较有系统地介绍苏联的经验，代表团于十七、八两日，分别应邀出席上海各界的讲演会和谈座会。
    苏联代表团在每一次群众大会上，都不止一次地为中国人民，特别是工人阶级而欢呼，为英勇无敌的人民解放军而欢呼。他们说：他们能在解放了的上海和中国工人阶级弟兄，和人民解放军见面，感到无上的荣幸与骄傲。十七日晚，在万余工人的欢迎会上，德奥米多夫历述上海工人的斗争历史；斯托列托夫高举拳头，庄严地向工人保证：在你们争取中国人民的幸福，争取工业、农业和文化的繁荣的英勇斗争中，全体苏联人民是跟你们站在一起的。马尔可夫代表苏联人民欢迎中国工人兄弟到苏联去做贵宾。艺术演出队的同志们说，他们因为能为工人演出而兴奋。红军歌舞团团员米那雅夫在北京演出时伤了手腕，到沪后医生屡劝他不要演出，但那天晚上，他坚决要继续演出。他说：为了上海工人同志能够看到红军舞蹈，即使今后手臂成为残废，也是非常快乐的。会场上的欢呼象海涛一样，每一个人都为国际友人这种伟大的国际友爱所深深感动。会后电话公司陈宗骘说：我参加了这个伟大的晚会，一直感到亲切和愉快，苏联的朋友们和我们一起鼓掌，一起欢呼，分不清主人和客人。中苏两大民族的友谊完全融洽在一起了。
    西蒙诺夫非常关心工人的工作和生活。十八、十九两日，他在百忙中和杜伯洛维娜等访问中纺、中机等工厂。他受到工人们热烈的欢迎。在各工厂的座谈会上，他细细地倾听着工人们叙述过去对反动派斗争的故事。详细访问了工厂里的工会组织，文娱活动，工人家庭，以至单身汉怎样做饭，工人饭厅、澡塘的设备等等。所有的谈话，都由她的书记用打字机记录下来，作为将来写中国工人的宝贵材料。他介绍苏联工人的生活的时候，他说苏联工人一面做工人，一面做大学生，他自己就是其中的一个。中国工人们异口同声地说：“我们正在努力向你学习！”工人们看到新中国的远景了。临走的时候，他更高兴地和中纺十二厂的工人合影，作为第一次见面的永恒的纪念。
    “这些人们——人民解放军在我们看来也就是文化工作者！”苏联代表团是这样认识中国人民解放军的。十八日晚上，代表团十分高兴地出席了第三野战军驻沪部队的欢迎会。在一万多指战员的面前，西蒙诺夫以最兴奋的心情欢呼“人民解放军万岁！”当西蒙诺夫述说中国人民解放军胜利地渡过长江，并解放了南京的消息传到布拉格世界拥护和平大会会场中，全体与会者狂欢庆祝达半小时之久的情景时，全场掌声雷动，历久不息。这是一个不平凡的欢迎会。在解放军代表向代表团献花和渡江战役纪念章之前，郭化若一一介绍了代表献花者——以人民政协代表魏来国为首的十八位战斗英雄的英雄事迹，在十八位人民英雄手捧鲜花和纪念章走到代表们的跟前，把纪念章挂在代表团的胸前时，西蒙诺夫把魏来国紧紧地拥抱起来，表示他对人民英雄的崇高敬意。
    十九日，是热爱人民、热爱苏联的革命文豪鲁迅先生逝世十三周年忌辰。苏联代表团在这一天的早上，由西蒙诺夫率领到鲁迅墓上献花。西蒙诺夫以沉重的心情在鲁迅的墓前简短致词说：苏联人民十分感谢地永远记着鲁迅先生对苏联的友谊。并且愿意保证，已经在苏联享有广大声誉的鲁迅的著作，不久就会成为他们祖国全体人民的财产。十一时许，西蒙诺夫又参加上海各界代表纪念鲁迅先生的大会。
    我们的国际友人于十九日晚带着上海人民的友情北去了。上海人民仍依依不舍。十九日下午，在欢送代表团的鸡尾酒会上，挂着一幅“欢迎你们再来中国！”的中俄文标语，这是每一个中国人心里所要说的话。
    三百多人的酒会，东一簇、西一簇的在碰杯，在诉说着永远说不完的友情。饶漱石、曾山、潘汉年在人丛中一个一个地找着苏联朋友碰杯。人们为斯大林元帅干杯，人们为毛泽东主席干杯，为离别干杯，也为希望不久将来见面干杯。
    饶漱石代表全华东及上海人民托代表团带给斯大林元帅几包华东劳动人民的特产。上海各界人民也分别献给代表团及演出队各种特产，感谢他们的访问。斯托列托夫在致谢词中说：你们热烈的招待我们，我们心里烙上永远不可磨灭的回忆！是的，这是珍贵的伟大的国际友谊的表现，饶漱石再三地祝福苏联朋友们一路平安！六时五十分，代表们到了车站，广场上欢送的各界人民发出不绝的欢呼。车站门上的十几枝熊熊火炬在跳跃着，人们的心也在跳跃着。苏联朋友们由饶漱石陪同步入水银灯照得通亮的月台，各界人民代表纷纷与朋友们握手话别。西蒙诺夫上了车，又下来和送行者再一次地握手。当乐队奏着“祖国进行曲”的时候，大家都跟着唱了起来，西蒙诺夫唱了，饶漱石唱了；会唱的人都唱起来了，中苏两国人民的友谊，完全融洽在歌声里。
