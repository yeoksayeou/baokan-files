[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Shanghai, 2nd Dispatch] Today is the day for Shanghai's six million people to support World Peace and a carnival celebrating the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The people of Shanghai showed unprecedented enthusiasm in commemorating this festival. The five-star red flags fluttered in the wind on major streets and on the spiers of tall buildings, reflecting each other brilliantly. Many streets and entrances of organs, factories and shops were decorated with colorful arches and lanterns. Big red lanterns with "Long Live Chairman Mao" were hung on the doors of many shops. In the afternoon, more than 30,000 representatives from all circles in Shanghai, representing six million people, held a grand and enthusiastic celebration meeting in the midst of a heavy wind and rain (it was originally decided to hold a celebration meeting of hundreds of thousands of people, but due to the rain, it was changed to a celebration meeting attended by representatives dispatched by the gathering parade teams). This is the third time that the people of Shanghai have celebrated their solemn festival with unparalleled jubilation. When Political Commissar Rao Shushi spoke to the representatives standing in the wind and rain at the meeting, his voice was constantly drowned out by the storm-like applause. When he said that Chairman Mao's victory is our victory, Chairman Mao's direction is our direction, and we, the six million people of Shanghai, must guarantee to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government that we will resolutely obey Chairman Mao's leadership, obey the leadership of the Central People's Government, and implement all laws, every one of his words aroused enthusiastic applause. Deputy Mayor Pan said in his speech: We warmly respond to the call of the World Peace Congress to defend world peace, earnestly unite the six million citizens of Shanghai, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, resolutely unite all peace-loving and free countries and people in the world, first of all, unite with the Soviet Union, all people's democratic countries and all oppressed nations, stand on the side of the international peace and democracy camp, and jointly oppose imperialist aggression to ensure lasting world peace. Liu Changsheng, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, called on the Shanghai working class to rise up and protect their motherland, advance bravely a hundredfold under the leadership of their own government and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and work hand in hand with the international working class headed by the Soviet Union to restore production, prosper the economy, and strengthen the forces of peace in order to defend world peace. Guo Huaruo, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, spoke, resolutely expressing that he would step up the training of troops to protect the people of Shanghai. Finally, six telegrams were passed, and the meeting adjourned.
