　　Citywide Cooperative Business Workshop
  　Proposes New Supply Target
  　Reach Sixty Percent of Total Wages Absorbed
    [Report from this newspaper] The citywide cooperative cadre business workshop, which cooperative cadres urgently demanded, was held on the 14th and ended on the 15th. More than 240 participating cadres listened to a report by Wang Chun, Director of the Municipal General Cooperative, on "How to Run Cooperatives Well." The report pointed out: Cooperatives are a new type of commerce and must pay attention to learning commercial techniques, expanding the economic base through the flexible turnover of funds and leveraging organizational strength, and operating businesses around the needs of members. It is important to be good at obtaining support and cooperation from the state-owned economy. Currently, each cooperative can only recover an average of 25 percent of total wages, indicating that it cannot meet the needs of its members. Absorbing 60 percent of total wages should be the immediate goal. Regarding management methods, he proposed first, to have a work plan based on typical surveys to improve business, and to oppose bureaucratic work styles. Second, to specifically allocate manpower, strictly divide responsibilities, and strive to reduce losses and increase supply. Third, to strengthen work inspection, master basic figures, and repeatedly compare figures such as purchase and sales, damage and consumption, and expenses, to find the reasons for increases and decreases, as a basis for improving business. After Director Wang's report, Wen Zhaotu reported on accounting statements. The next day, small group discussions revealed that many cooperatives had shortcomings such as not daring to use shares, a mentality of giving alms, and selling at the original price. They also reflected shortcomings such as the grain company's incomplete seed varieties and the General Cooperative's business department's short sales hours. They requested that the General Cooperative stipulate uniform accounting subjects and ledger styles, and print monthly reports on their behalf. Finally, Director Wang made a concluding speech. He said: This workshop is also a short-term training class, and everyone has gained a lot in these two days. He hopes that after everyone goes back, first, they will report to the administration and the trade union and raise questions; second, they will thoroughly close accounts and clear assets; third, they will hold cadre meetings to examine work attitudes and thinking, and demand that the work be improved one step further under the existing conditions. From now on, make a great change in work, create model cooperatives and cooperative heroes, and complete the tasks given to us by the representatives of all sectors.

　　全市合作业务讲习会
  　提出新供应目标
  　达到吸收全工资十分之六
    【本报讯】全市合作干部所迫切要求的业务讲习会，于十四日举行，十五日结束。二百四十余名到会干部听取了市总社主任王纯“怎样办好合作社”的报告。报告指出：合作社是新的商业，必须注意学习商业技术，从灵活周转资金及发挥组织力量中扩大经济基础，围绕社员需要经营业务。善于取得国营经济的扶植与互相配合，现各社平均只能收回全工资的百分之二十五，说明不能满足社员之需要，应把吸收全工资百分之六十，作为最近的奋斗目标。关于经营管理方法，他提出第一要有工作计划，根据典型调查，改进业务，反对事务主义。第二要具体分配人力，严格分工负责，为减少损耗提高供应量而努力。第三要加强工作检查。掌握基本数字，把进销货、伤耗、开支等数字反复比较，找出增减原因，作为改进业务的依据。王主任报告后，由温兆图报告会计表报问题。第二天小组讨论，好多合作社都检讨了不敢动用股金、恩赐观点、按原价出售等缺点。并反映了粮食公司粮种不全，总社营业部卖货时间太短等缺点，纷纷要求总社规定统一的会计科目、帐簿式样，并代印月报表。最后由王主任作总结发言。他说：这个讲习会也是短期训练班，两天之中大家有很多收获。他希望大家回去之后第一要向行政及工会汇报、提出问题；第二要彻底结帐清理财产；第三开干部会检查工作态度及思想，要求在现有条件下把工作提高一步，从此来个工作上的大转变，创造模范合作社和合作英雄，为完成各界代表会给我们的任务而努力。
