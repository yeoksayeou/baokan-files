Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association General Preparatory Committee and the China Peace Congress jointly hosted a grand evening party yesterday to celebrate the birth of the People's Republic of China and the establishment of the China Peace Congress. The art troupe of the Soviet Cultural, Art and Science Workers Delegation and the North China University of Literature and Art jointly performed wonderful programs. Chairman Mao and the members of the Central People's Government attended the performance. Among the performers of the Soviet Art Troupe, eight have won the Stalin Prize, and thirteen are members of the Red Army Song and Dance Troupe youth team who won the best award in the recent World Youth Festival drama competition. They performed a total of six programs, including solos, violin and piano solos, solo dances, duets, and Red Army dances. Each performance was enthusiastically requested by the audience to be repeated. Especially the Red Army dance was the most popular and won long applause. When Soviet singer Smelev sang "March of the World Democratic Youth", those in the audience who knew the song couldn't help but sing along. After the Soviet Art Troupe finished their performance, representatives of the Beijing Municipal Women's Federation presented flowers to the troupe, and the North China University of Literature and Art also presented waist drums to them. Then, the North China University of Literature and Art performed the People's Victory Song and Dance. From beginning to end, shouts of "Long live Stalin" and "Long live Mao Zedong" frequently erupted in the hall. When Smelev finished singing and walked off the stage to pay tribute to Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao shook hands with him cordially and expressed his gratitude and regards to the Soviet artists who participated in the performance. At this time, another burst of enthusiastic cheers rang out in the hall.

    【新华社北京四日电】中苏友好协会总会筹备会、中国保卫世界和平大会，为庆祝中华人民共和国诞生及中国保卫世界和平大会的成立，于昨日联合主办盛大晚会。由苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团艺术演出队和华北大学文艺学院联合表演精彩节目。毛主席和中央人民政府的委员们均到场观看。苏联艺术演出队的表演者中有八位曾荣获斯大林奖金，有十三位是在最近世界青年节戏剧比赛中获得最优奖的红军歌舞团青年队的队员。他们一共表演了六个节目，有独唱、有提琴和钢琴独奏、有单人舞、双人舞、红军舞蹈，每一次表演都被观众热烈地要求再来一次，尤以红军舞蹈最受欢迎，赢得了长时间的大鼓掌。苏联独唱家史灭略夫独唱“世界民主青年进行曲”时，台下会唱这个歌的人情不自禁地和唱起来。苏联艺术演出队表演毕，北京市妇联代表向该队献花，华大文艺学院也向他们献腰鼓。接着，华大文艺学院演出人民胜利大歌舞。自始至终，场内不时爆发“斯大林万岁”、“毛泽东万岁”的欢呼声。当史灭略夫唱演完毕，走下台来向毛主席致敬时，毛主席和他亲切地握手，并对参加表演的苏联艺术家们表示谢意和慰问。这时会场又响起了一阵热烈的欢呼声。
