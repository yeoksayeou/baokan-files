Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th. Following the million-strong citizen demonstration parade, Shanghai held a grand water parade on the 10th. This is another great feat by the people of Shanghai to defend peace and celebrate the birth of the People's Republic of China. Seventeen units including the Shipping Department, the Seamen's Union, the Steamship Industry Association, the Yangtze River Shipping Joint Office, the Jianghai Customs, the Water Police Bureau, and the Garrison Command, as well as over twenty organizations and groups including the Arts Department, the Film Studio, the Music Association, the East China Cultural Work Troupe, the East China Military Band, the East China Peking Opera Troupe, the Great China Record Company, and the People's Broadcasting Station, participated, dispatching a total of thirty-two vessels of various sizes. At this time, the vast and clear Huangpu River along the Bund was filled with boats decorated in a myriad of colors, and cheers shook the entire river surface.

At 6 p.m., the parade began. The ships were divided into two teams, centered on the Bund Park, heading south to the 16th Pier and north to Tilanqiao, sailing back and forth along the Bund in an orderly manner. The southward team was led by the "Mao Zedong" ship, followed by the "Zhu De," "New China," and "Beijing" ships, with the "Worker" ship at the rear. The northward team was led by the "Stalin" ship, followed by the "Lenin," "Marx," "Peace," and "Democracy" ships... with the "People" ship at the rear. Various artistic groups performed on each ship.

When the "Mao Zedong" and "Stalin" ships first met, all the ships sounded their horns in unison, searchlights shone in all directions, sparks flew, songs resounded, and cheers erupted from the ships and the shore, symbolizing the great unity of the Chinese and Soviet people. During the parade, whenever the "Mao Zedong" and "Stalin" ships passed by, tens of thousands of spectators on the shore shouted in unison "Long live Chairman Mao," "Long live Stalin," and "Long live Sino-Soviet cooperation." At this time, the entire Bund river surface was illuminated by electric lights, torches, waves, and moonlight, with cheers, music, firecrackers, gongs, drums, and songs merging together. The river parade went back and forth twice. Finally, various artistic groups also performed a hundred-person waist drum dance on the Bund Road, with the revelry ending at midnight.

　　保卫和平·庆祝新中国诞生
    沪举行壮丽水上游行
    黄浦江头万紫千红船只如梭毛泽东斯大林万岁声震江面
    【新华社上海十二日电】继百万市民示威游行之后，沪市十日又举行盛大水上游行。此为沪市人民保卫和平、庆祝中华人民共和国诞生的又一壮举。参加游行的有航运处、海员工会、轮船业同业公会、长江航业联营处、江海关、水上公安局、警备司令部等十七个单位以及文艺处、电影室、音协、华东文工团、华东军乐队、华东平剧团、大中华唱片厂、人民广播电台等二十余机关团体，共出动大小船只三十二艘。这时外滩一带广阔明静的黄浦江上，满布了装饰得千紫万红的船只，狂欢声震动整个江面。
    下午六时，游行开始，船分两队，以外滩公园为中心，向南至十六铺，向北至提篮桥，沿外滩鱼贯而行，往来穿梭。南行的一队以毛泽东号前导，继为朱德号、新中国号、北京号，由工人号殿尾。北行的一队为斯大林号领首，后为列宁号、马克思号、和平号、民主号……由人民号殿后。各文艺团体均分乘各船进行表演。
    当毛泽东号与斯大林号第一次相遇时，各船汽笛齐鸣，探照灯光四射，火花纷飞，歌声四溢，船上、岸边欢呼如雷，象征着中苏人民的伟大团结。游行中，每当毛泽东号斯大林号经过时，岸上千万观众即一齐高呼“毛主席万岁”“斯大林万岁”“中苏合作万岁”。此时整个外滩江面电灯、火炬、浪波和月光交辉，欢呼、音乐、鞭炮、锣鼓与歌声合流。江上游行往返二次。最后各文艺团体又在外滩马路举行百人大腰鼓表演，狂欢至夜十二时结束。
