    Twelve. Demanding Answers

    After the matter of matchmaking was brought up, Little Foreign Devil didn't press for an answer, but the Liugou family, without waiting for Da San to fetch his clothes, washed them early and brought them over, asking Da San for news. Da San had originally considered this a joke and hadn't given the Liugou family a definite answer. Unexpectedly, the Liugou family kept pressing him several times, and Da San got anxious and said, "I haven't planned on getting married yet!" The Liugou family said, "Oh, look at you! Your head is almost bald! Do you have to wait until you're in the ground before finding a widow to watch the gate? Tsk!" Then, the Liugou family pleaded softly and firmly, and finally whispered, "You're not stupid, are you? Let me be frank! If Baiquan's family hadn't been sold to Old Man Jubaо, wouldn't I have arranged it for you? But that's impossible now! Besides, I've found three for you to choose from! I guarantee each one is better than Baiquan's family!" As soon as Da San heard this, he felt a fire rising, and quickly said, "Who's spreading rumors that I'm interested in Baiquan's family? Forget it! Stop talking!" After saying that, Da San lay down on the kang, ignoring everyone; but the Liugou family mistakenly thought Da San was just embarrassed, so they sat on the edge of the kang and talked alone for a while before shouting, "Tianlu's family!" and went to the neighboring room.

    That night, Tianlu came to Da San's room again. He stammered for a long time before hesitatingly saying, "Old Third! The Liugou family is trying to..." Before he finished, he kept striking the flint to light his pipe; his wife, who was probably eavesdropping outside the door, pushed the door open and said, "He can't even say a sentence! Isn't the Liugou family trying to find you a wife, Third Brother?" Da San said, "They are, but I didn't agree to it." Tianlu's wife turned her face away and said with a smile, "Third Brother! The Liugou family said you're interested in that Baiquan's family! Is that true?" Da San was awkward and didn't know how to answer, but Tianlu stood up and said, "Old Third! I heard she's some kind of maidservant of Old Man Jubao, that won't do!" Da San got anxious and quickly stood up to explain for a long time, finally saying, "I never planned on getting married in the first place, don't listen to those people's nonsense." Tianlu's wife said, "Third Brother! This is a proper thing you should be doing, don't say that." Tianlu also said, "It's something that needs to be done, and I've wanted to talk to you about this for a while. But you should find a simple farmer to live an honest life with, it won't cost much, and it's reliable. Old Third, I'm telling you this from the bottom of my heart as your brother! What do you say?" Da San knew that his brother and sister-in-law were indeed well-intentioned, but he didn't know what to say for a moment, so he casually explained a few more times and urged them to go to sleep.

    Afterward, the Liugou family kept coming to inquire about Da San, his brother and sister-in-law came to persuade him every few days, and Little Foreign Devil sometimes secretly asked him a few questions, which really annoyed him. He had thought about getting married these days, but what he thought was: if he was going to marry, he wanted to marry someone he was mutually in love with, otherwise, he'd give up. Like when he was outside, he wouldn't say anything if he didn't want to, and if he felt like it, he'd just find a woman to spend the night with; he didn't want the whole set of matchmaking, spending money, and riding in a sedan chair like in the village. But he couldn't persuade people, he said he didn't want to marry, and people would persuade him gently and firmly; he said he didn't have money, and the Liugou family didn't believe him at all, but his brother and sister-in-law said it wouldn't cost much... He was really annoyed by this matter.

    Later, his second brother saw that he couldn't change his mind after saying it a few times, so he gave up. His second sister-in-law saw that her husband didn't say anything, so she said less too; only the Liugou family kept pestering him every day, and he really had no choice. Fortunately, in the blink of an eye, it was the end of the fourth lunar month. In the mountainous area west of Niangziguan, the weather was just starting to warm up, and the area around Black Rock Slope was the time for planting, everyone was busy, and the Liugou family also had some farming to do, so they didn't have much free time; Da San finally had two days of peace, and the matter of matchmaking was temporarily put aside.

    Thirteen. Going to the Fields

    After the matter of matchmaking was put aside, Da San also started preparing to go to the fields, planning to plant some gourds in the mu of land that Xilu gave him.

    However, one obstacle after another: as soon as Da San went to the fields, he encountered some other unpleasant things.

    Da San hadn't farmed the land for twenty years. He had no seeds or farming tools, and the neighbors on both sides were also short of this and that, so he couldn't borrow anything, which was very inconvenient. Later, Xilu said, "If you're short of anything, go to my house, I can't use it all." So Da San went to his house to borrow. The part-time worker he hired was called Bian Xiao, an outsider, a bachelor, and a pretty good person who took good care of Da San; but his sons weren't generous, and they weren't happy to lend anything, and they always lent him broken things, which made Da San very angry. Da San didn't usually go to Xilu's house much. In the past, when they met, he would just talk about some tricks and rules inside and outside the kiln, and because Xilu always took care of him when it came to eating and drinking, he felt that Xilu was not a bad person; now he had to go to his house to borrow farming tools every few days. When the two met more often, Xilu would inevitably hold him back to talk nonsense, about planting, doing business, what could make more money, and every time he would always tell him to plan early for the money for workers to open the kiln after the autumn, and he kept calculating how to spend less and earn more from this rolling kiln... As time went on, Da San felt that Xilu was also so long-winded, and that he was really only concerned about money, and that he was not much better than the kiln owners he often saw who enriched themselves by exploiting the kiln blacks. He didn't feel much for Xilu. Once, Xilu also wanted Da San to save some money to marry a wife, and he repeatedly said that he was also willing to help him find a good girl... This made Da San feel even more that something was wrong with Xilu, making him unable to muster any enthusiasm.

    十二  催问
    说亲的事提过以后，小洋鬼倒没怎么来催问，柳沟家却没等大三去取衣裳，就早早把衣裳洗好送来，并跟大三讨回讯；大三原不过把这当耍笑事，就没给柳沟家一句准话。不想柳沟家却连着催了好几回，大三急了，就道：“我这会还没盘算娶家口哩！”柳沟家说：“哎呀你看你！头顶都快秃啦！莫非要等你进土呀，才寻个守望门寡的么？嗨！”接着，柳沟家软说硬说，最后又悄悄道：“你这人又不是不机伶，我说个痛快吧！白泉家要没卖给聚宝老人家，我还能不给你说成？可这会不行嘛！再说，我寻下了三个让你挑！保管个个都比白泉家好！”大三一听这，不觉火气上冒，忙道：“谁们瞎说我看上了白泉家？算球啦吧！快别说啦！”说完，大三往炕上一躺，不理人了；但柳沟家却错认大三是不好意思，又坐上炕沿，一个人说了一阵，才吆喝着：“天禄家！”上隔壁屋里去了。
    这天黑夜，天禄又上了大三屋里。他圪＠了老大一会，才吞吞吐吐道：“老三！柳沟家给你……”没说完，他又一个劲打火镰吸烟；他老婆许是在门外偷听着的，这时她推门进来道：“他这嘴连一句话也说不出的！不是说柳沟家给你说亲么，三兄弟？”大三说：“说来着，可我没应承他。”天禄老婆撇过脸去笑说道：“三兄弟！柳沟家说你对什么白泉家有意思啦！可有这事么？”大三蹩蹩扭扭地不好回答，天禄却立起来道：“老三！听说是聚宝老人家的什么丫头使女，那可是不行啊！”大三急了，也忙立起来解说了半天，最后说：“我起根就没盘算过说家口的事，可别听那些人瞎胡叨叨”天禄老婆道：“三兄弟！这可是你正该着办的正经事，快别那么说。”天禄也道：“事情是要办，我也早就想跟你说这的。可你还是寻个粗庄户人，象模象样过日子的，花钱不多，又靠实。老三，我作哥哥的这可是实心话！你说呢？”大三知道他哥嫂的确都是一片好心，可他一时又没什么说的，就又随便解说两句，催他们睡去了。
    以后柳沟家还是不断来雇问大三，他哥嫂也三天两头来打劝他，小洋鬼有时也偷偷问他两句，他真没好气。他这些天倒也想过娶家口的事，可他想的是：要就娶个两相情愿心碰心的，要不就拉倒，象他在外边那样，不想就不说，想起来就随便找个女人过一夜；要象村里这样说媒、花钱、坐轿一套，他不愿意。但他又没法说服人家，他说他不想娶，人家就紧打劝慢打劝；他说没钱，柳沟家就一万个不信，他哥嫂却说花钱不多……他真为这事烦的不行。
    后来他老二见说了几回总说不转他，也就算了，他二嫂见男人不说，她也说得少了；只柳沟家还是见天缠他，他真没办法。幸好一转眼就是阴历四月末，娘子关往西的山地，天气刚不冷，黑石坡左近正是养种地的时候，大家都忙起来了，柳沟家也有些地里的营生要做，没什么闲工夫；大三这才安生了两天，说亲的事算是暂且搁下了。
    十三　上地
    说亲的事搁下以后，大三也就拾掇上地，盘算着在喜禄给他的那一亩地里栽点窝瓜。
    但是，过了一关又一关：大三一上地，又碰到些别的不痛快。
    大三有二十年没养种过地了。他籽种农具什么也没有，左右邻家也都是缺这短那，借也借不上，很不方便。后来喜禄说：“短什么上我家去，我使不清。”大三就上他家去借。他家雇的那个半块长工叫扁小，是个外来户，光棍汉，人还挺好，挺关照大三；他的小子们却手面不宽，借什么也不痛快，还总是借给坏的，大三很生气。大三平日本来就不大去喜禄家，往常见了面，也只是捣拉一些窑里窑外的把式规章，又因为喜禄吃喝上头短不了照应他，他也就觉得喜禄这人还不赖；现在三天两头的要去他家借农具使，二人见面多了，喜禄就短不了拉住他瞎捣拉，什么养种地啦，作买卖啦，什么能多赚钱啦，每回还总叫他早些盘算秋后开窑用的工花的钱，又一个劲让他合计这滚窑怎么才能花得少赚得大……日子长了，大三觉得喜禄这人也这么噜嗦，掏开心眼还是为的两个钱，比他常见的那些靠克索窑黑养肥自己的窑主们也好球不了多少，他对喜禄也就觉得意思不大。碰对有一回，喜禄也要大三攒两个钱娶个家口，他并且反复说着他也愿意打帮着给寻个好闺女……这么一来，大三更觉着喜禄这人不对劲，闹得他自己也老是提不起劲头。
