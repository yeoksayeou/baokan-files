　　Two Drops of Oil
　　Changxindian Machine Factory Kai Qing
　　The motor hummed, driving the overhead shaft to spin like mad, the belt transmitting power to each machine with a whooshing sound. Worker Lao Kang, carrying an oilcan, walked over when suddenly two drops of oil fell from the overhead shaft's bearing onto Lao Kang's face. Lao Kang thought: These two drops of oil, while their value is small, if this continues year after year, it will add up, and that would be a loss to the factory; this is our people's property, and we must find a way to ensure that not a single bit of it is lost. He spent two days thinking and finally came up with a plan: he found some scrap iron in the scrap pile and, during his spare time, made several square iron troughs to hang high under each overhead shaft bearing. Now, every drop of oil that leaks from the bearing falls into the square iron troughs made by Lao Kang.
　　Everyone praised Lao Kang's spirit of saving the people's property when they saw it.

　　两滴油
    长辛店机厂  凯卿
    马达（电机）嗡嗡的响，牵动天轴飞也似的转，皮带哗啦啦的传动每个机器工作，工友老康提着油壶走到这里，突然两个油滴从天轴的轴瓦上飞落下来掉在老康脸上。老康想：这两点油滴，价值虽然很小，但是，如果要成年累月的下去，那就可多啦，也就是工厂的损失啊；这是我们人民的财产，我们要想办法，叫它一丝一毫都不能损失才对。他费了两天的思想，终于想出了计划：在废铁堆找来了几块废铁板，工余时作了几个方铁斗高高的挂在每个天轴瓦下面，现在，每滴从轴瓦漏下的油都落在老康作的方铁斗里。
    老康的这种节省人民财物的精神，人人见了都称赞。
