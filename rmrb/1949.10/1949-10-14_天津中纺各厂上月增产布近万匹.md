　　Tianjin China Textile Factories
    Increased Cloth Production by Nearly 10,000 Bolts Last Month
    [Tianjin News] The six factories under the Tianjin China Textile Construction Company launched a production upsurge in September centering on the public announcement of the CCP branches. For the entire month, they produced more than 18,100 bales of yarn and more than 423,800 bolts of cloth. Compared with August, yarn production increased by more than 440 bales, and cloth production increased by more than 9,200 bolts. In September, Communist Party members, Youth League members, and the vast number of trade union members in various factories all formulated and completed individual and team production plans to welcome the public announcement of the branches. The Youth League members operating the cloth inspection machines at the No. 3 China Textile Factory generally exceeded the prescribed unit output (43.5 yards), with the highest reaching 48 yards. In view of the fact that production in various factories has entered a normal track, the company is now starting to formulate a one-year work plan in order to further improve output and quality.
