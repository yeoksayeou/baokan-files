　　Capital City Sports Meet Postponed
  　City's Primary and Secondary Schools Preparing for Mass Gymnastics Display
    [Beijing News] The Capital City People's Sports Meet has been postponed to October 22nd and 23rd, according to a decision by the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee. The person in charge of the Preparatory Committee stated that the reason for the postponement is mainly because this Sports Meet is the first large-scale sports activity in the capital. On the one hand, it celebrates the birth of the People's Republic of China, and on the other hand, it is the starting point for the development of new sports undertakings in New China, which is of particular significance. Therefore, it is hoped that all factories, schools, troops, government organizations, and groups will intensify their preparations and mobilize the majority of workers and students to actively participate. To this end, the Municipal Education Bureau has issued a notice calling on all middle and primary schools to deepen their emphasis on this Sports Meet. Currently, more than 400 physical education teachers from middle and primary schools have been fully mobilized to actively prepare for the city-wide collective program – "Mass Gymnastics Display." The guidance team from the Physical Education Department of Normal University also went to 22 factories and units, such as Shijingshan Power Plant and 70th Arsenal, at the end of last month to assist workers in preparing various programs.

　　首都体育大会改期
  　全市中小学正准备大会操
    【北京讯】首都人民体育大会顷经该会筹委会常务委员会决定延期改为十月二十二、二十三两日举行。据该会筹委会负责人谈：体育大会延期的原因主要是因为这次体育大会是首都第一次大规模的体育活动，它一方面是庆祝中华人民共和国的诞生，一方面又是发展新中国新的体育事业的起点，意义特别重大，因此希望各工厂、学校、部队、机关团体加紧准备并发动大多数工人、学生等踊跃参加。为此，本市教育局已发出通知，号召各中、小学加深对此次体育大会之重视，目前各中、小学的体育教员四百余人已全体动员，积极准备全市性集体节目——“大会操”，师大体育系辅导组亦已于上月底去石景山发电所、七十兵工厂等二十二工厂单位，协助工人准备各种节目。
