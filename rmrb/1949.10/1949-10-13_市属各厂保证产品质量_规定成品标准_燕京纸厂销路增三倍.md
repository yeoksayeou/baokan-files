　　Municipal Factories Guarantee Product Quality
    Stipulate Finished Product Standards
    Yanjing Paper Mill Sales Increase Threefold
    [Beijing News] Various factories under the Beijing Municipal People's Government Industry Bureau are gradually establishing new systems, relying on workers to improve quality and reduce costs, and have achieved preliminary results. Qinghe Woolen Mill has now clearly stipulated finished product standards and specifications, and has formulated reward and punishment systems based on the classification of product grades. The Trolleybus Company Repair and Manufacturing Plant has initially discussed the establishment of production standards and labor discipline. Since August, veteran workers on the bus routes have initiated a vehicle care campaign, establishing competition groups for diligence, learning, and mutual assistance, with 229 people participating. They have set their own work standards as: uniform driving distance, vehicle protection, electricity conservation, accident reduction, and ensuring no missed fares. Yanjing Paper Mill started a production competition in September, and the workers' morale is high. They guarantee uniform pulping, and the finished product standard has been raised from a deviation of three pounds from the standard amount per ream of paper to two pounds. At the same time, the copper mesh is washed more diligently, and the pinholes in the finished product have also been greatly reduced. Therefore, customers are willing to pay 3,000 yuan more per ream for the white printing paper produced in September than for that produced in August, and sales have increased more than threefold compared to August. Costs have also been reduced compared to before, with a total cost reduction of 778 yuan per ream of paper. In the past, the newly built brick kiln lacked an inspection system, and half of the finished products did not meet the standards. After the establishment of an inspection system in September, less than 10 percent of the products are substandard. The cost of each brick has been reduced by 0.55 yuan. With a daily production of 100,000 bricks, this saves 55,000 yuan.
    Although the factories have achieved considerable results in establishing production standards, they still lack detailed standards and systems in management, and lack scientific division of labor in the organization of labor. Therefore, the Bureau plans to clearly stipulate production standards, formulate production systems, improve management methods, clarify responsibilities, and continue to implement democratic management in order to further restore and develop production.

　　市属各厂保证产品质量
    规定成品标准
    燕京纸厂销路增三倍
    【北京讯】京市人民政府工业局所属各厂正逐步建立新制度，依靠工人提高质量、减低成本，已获初步成绩。清河制呢厂现已明确规定成品标准与规格，并根据产品等级的划分，规定了奖惩制度。电车公司修造厂初步讨论建立生产标准和劳动纪律，车路上自八月份就有老工人发起爱护车辆运动，成立竞赛勤劳、学习、互助等小组，参加的已达二百二十九人。他们自订工作标准是：行车距离匀整、保护车辆、节约电流、减免事故、保证不漏票。燕京造纸厂，自九月起开始生产竞赛，工人情绪高涨，保证打浆均匀，成品标准已由每令纸与标准量不差三磅，提高到不差两磅。同时，加勤冲洗铜网，成品沙眼也大大减少，故顾客买九月份出的白片艳，愿比八月份的每令多出价三千元，销数比八月份增加三倍多。成本亦较前减低，合计每令纸减低成本七百七十八元。新建窑厂过去因无检查制度，成品不合标准的占一半。九月份建立检查制度后，产品不合标准的已不到百分之十。每个砖的成本减少了五角五分。每天以生产十万块砖计，就节省五万五千元。
    各厂在建立生产标准方面虽已获得相当成绩，但经营上还缺乏细密的标准与制度，在劳动力的组织上还缺乏科学的分工，所以该局准备明确规定生产标准，订立生产制度，改善经营方法，严明职责，并继续贯彻民主管理，以求进一步的恢复与发展生产。
