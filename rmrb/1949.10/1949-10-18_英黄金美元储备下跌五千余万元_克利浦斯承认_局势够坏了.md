Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th. Britain's economic situation continues to deteriorate after devaluation. Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps revealed at the Lord Mayor of London's annual banquet on the evening of the 4th that Britain's gold and dollar reserves fell by another £55 million in the third quarter of this year. As of September 30, Britain's total reserves were only £351 million (still calculated at the pre-devaluation rate of £1 equals $4.03), far below the minimum safe limit of £500 million previously stipulated by Cripps. On June 30, Britain's reserves were still £406 million, and on March 31, they were £471 million. The sharp decline in reserves in the third quarter was due to a huge dollar deficit of £133 million caused by the trade deficit, a figure only slightly lower than in the second quarter and the highest since the first quarter of 1948. Although it was offset by £71 million in Marshall Plan grants and £7 million in Canadian loans, the shortfall still reached £55 million. Cripps could not help but admit: "These figures may not be as bad as some people fear, but they are bad enough." In his speech, Cripps pinned his hopes of Britain's escape from this serious dollar deficit on the devaluation of the pound sterling, which would stimulate exports of British goods and the inflow of dollars. But even he himself admitted that the results would be very slim. According to Agence France-Presse, financial circles in London pointed out that when Cripps announced the devaluation of the pound sterling, he claimed that only the price of bread would rise, but now the price of all raw materials has generally risen. Cripps devalued the pound sterling by one-third in order to stabilize the pound's price, but since the beginning of October, the black market price of the pound has begun to fall again, and the exchange rate of the pound in some foreign markets has also fallen below the official exchange rate.

　　英黄金美元储备下跌五千余万元
  　克利浦斯承认“局势够坏了”
    【新华社北京十七日电】英国经济情势在贬值后继续恶化。财政大臣克利浦斯四日晚在伦敦市长的年宴上透露：英国黄金与美元储备在今年第三季又下跌五千五百万镑。截至九月三十日，英国的全部准备仅有三亿五千一百万镑（仍按贬值前一英镑合四点零三美元计算），远在克利浦斯早先所规定的五亿镑准备的最低安全限度之下。而六月三十日英国的准备尚有四亿零六百万镑，三月三十一日则有四亿七千一百万镑。第三季准备金的剧烈下降，是由于贸易逆差所引起的一亿三千三百万镑的巨额美元亏空，这个数字仅略低于第二季而为一九四八年第一季以来的最高额。虽然有七千一百万镑的马歇尔计划拨款与七百万镑的加拿大贷款抵补，但不敷之数仍达五千五百万镑。克利浦斯不能不承认：“这些数字或许不象有人所害怕的那样坏，但是它们已经是够坏的了”。克利浦斯在谈话中，把英国解脱这种严重的美元亏空的希望，寄托于英镑贬值后能刺激英国货的输出与美元之流入。但是甚至他自己也承认其结果将十分渺茫。据法新社电伦敦金融界人士指出：克利浦斯在宣布英镑贬值时宣称只有面包价格会上涨，而现在则一切原料的价格已普遍上涨。克利浦斯为了稳定英镑价格而把英镑贬值三分之一，而自十月初以来英镑的黑市价又已开始跌落，英镑在若干外国市场上的汇率亦已低于官方汇率。
