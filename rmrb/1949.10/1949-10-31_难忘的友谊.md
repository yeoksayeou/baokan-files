Unforgettable Friendship
　　Xiang Guorong, Driver Worker of Nanjing Construction Bureau

　　I am a car driver. This time, I was honored to be a car driver in the reception for the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation in Nanjing.

　　At twelve o'clock on the night of October 12th, more than thirty of our driver comrades took cars and lined up to arrive at Xiaguan Railway Station. Every comrade was eagerly waiting for our international friends.

　　The train was late, and we all stayed up all night at the station, but we were welcoming the first international delegation to the new China, and no one felt tired. We waited eagerly and reminded each other to show the excellent qualities of the Chinese working class in this task of receiving Soviet friends.

　　At five o'clock in the morning on the 13th, amid the melodious and loud sounds of military music, the head of the Soviet delegation, Comrade Fadeev, holding flowers, walked out of the station side by side with Deputy Mayor Ke. He and the members of the delegation, in the cheers, slogans, and applause of the welcoming masses, boarded the car and drove to the municipal government's reception center.

　　I was assigned to the "Capital Hotel" hostel to serve the film crew in the delegation. When the four of them first got into my car, each comrade extended their hand to shake mine and said, "Hello, Comrade!" This was the first time in my life that I had come into contact with the friendship of Soviet friends, and my heart was filled with infinite excitement and joy! I replied to them, "Hello, Comrades!"

　　On the morning of the 14th, I drove the photography team to Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to pay respects to the mausoleum and photograph the scenery of the mausoleum. Before departure, I put their camera and frame in the trunk of the car and wiped the windshield of the car. I drove forward in a motorcade of dozens of cars going to the mausoleum. On the way out of Zhongshan Gate, a member of the photography team asked me in broken Chinese: "Can you speak Russian?" "No," I said. "Do you understand English?" I replied, "A little." So he spoke to me in English: "Comrade! What a beautiful and rich land! The land of freedom and happiness for the great Chinese people." He also asked me, "Do you know Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union?" I replied, "I know! Moscow is the most beautiful and bustling metropolis for the working people in the Soviet Union and in the world. I think it is much more beautiful than here!"

　　He asked me interestingly, "Comrade, have you been to Moscow? How do you know it?"

　　"No, I have never been to the Soviet Union. I read about Moscow when I read about Soviet geography and history. I love every inch of Soviet land very much. In my mind, it seems like our own Chinese working people's land," I replied.

　　He said enthusiastically, "Dear Comrade! Chinese friends! We welcome you all to visit the Soviet Union and Moscow."

　　"Thank you! I will definitely have a chance to go in the future," I replied gratefully.

　　In front of the tomb, they introduced me to meet the head of the delegation, Fadeev, who shook my hand tightly and said, "Hello! Comrade!" "Hello! Comrade Fadeev," I said, imitating Russian. They all smiled at me, some patting me on the shoulder. At noon, after lunch near Linggu Temple, I drove the photographers to the Astronomical Observatory Mountain. The autumn mountain road was hidden under the deep red branches on both sides, and tall mountain grass grew along the road. We drove past the beautiful mountain road and reached the top of the mountain, contacted the garrison, and drove up to the Astronomical Observatory.

　　At this time, I was their guide, because they did not bring a Russian translator. We asked an employee of the Astronomical Observatory to guide us to visit the instruments and climb to the highest peak of the Astronomical Observatory. After they admired the scenery of the Yangtze River and the city, they took the camera to the mountain peak and took two rolls of film. At this time, seven or eight students from the Military and Political University suddenly came over, hoping to meet the Soviet delegation. Fortunately, I understood English and introduced the opinions of the Military University students to the photography team. They shook hands warmly with each other.

　　The photographer who could talk to me in English made a suggestion to us, asking us to take a few photos with them on the mountain peak as a memorial to the international brotherhood. They each took turns taking pictures, and the other three sat with us, sitting on the sun-drenched mountain peak, and filmed several colorful shots (this is a color negative). The Soviet friends sincerely said: "Each of us feels very honored and happy, because today we can take pictures with you, our dear Chinese friends, on this mountain peak, and receive your warm welcome, which gives us very precious friendship. Thank you! We will take the sincere love and brotherly friendship you have given us, along with these photos, back to the Soviet Union and introduce them to every Soviet people. I think after returning home, I will send a few samples to you for your criticism."

　　The students of the Military University asked me to tell the members of the delegation about their feelings of great friendship with Soviet friends today. They shook the hands of the Soviet friends enthusiastically. The members of the delegation smiled from ear to ear. Then they said seriously: "Comrades! We are international brothers, and we cannot be separated from each other. Our two great countries must unite to fight for the great cause of consolidating world democratic peace and for eliminating the imperialist conspiracy to launch aggressive wars!"

　　We also said with the same enthusiasm: "The Soviet people are the teachers of the Chinese people, and we are willing to be Stalin's loyal students forever and learn from the Soviet people forever. This is our task."

　　Long live Comrade Stalin!
　　Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!
　　Long live the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!
　　Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　We raised our hands and shouted slogans to each other enthusiastically. These slogans will forever maintain the close friendship between the two great laboring people's countries. We sang the Internationale and walked down the hillside, and the valley echoed with enthusiastic echoes.

　　The students of the Military University lined up and saluted them to say goodbye, and we also drove down the mountain road of the Astronomical Observatory and returned to the hostel to rest.

　　In the evening, we set off to Shanghai, and I sent them to Xiaguan Railway Station. When we said goodbye, they shook my hand one by one and said, "Goodbye, Comrade!" "Goodbye! Goodbye!" I was moved by a strong feeling of friendship, and I shook hands with them to say goodbye as if I had lost something important.

　　难忘的友谊
    南京建设局司机工人  项国荣
    我是一个汽车司机，这次荣幸地在欢迎苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团来宁招待大会里担任了汽车司机工作。
    十月十二日夜十二时我们一起有三十多位司机同志乘车整队到达下关车站，每个同志都热情地等候我们的国际友人。
    火车来迟了，我们大家在车站上通宵没有睡眠，但我们欢迎的是第一个到新中国来的国际友人的代表团，谁也不觉得疲倦，热切地等待着，同时互相提示着，要在这次招待苏联朋友的任务中，表现出中国工人阶级的优良品质。
    十三日早晨五时，在军乐悠扬宏亮的声音里，苏联代表团团长法捷耶夫同志手里拿着鲜花与柯副市长并肩走出车站，他和代表团的团员们在欢迎群众的欢呼声、口号声、和鼓掌声中，登车驶到市政府交际处去。
    我被派到“首都饭店”招待所，给代表团里的电影工作队员们服务。当他们四个人第一次坐进我的汽车时，每个同志都伸出了他们的手来握紧我的手说：“同志，你好！”这是我生平中第一次接触到苏联朋友的友爱，心中是无限的兴奋和喜悦！我回答他们：“你好，同志！”
    十四日上午，我送摄影工作队到中山陵去谒陵和拍摄陵园风景。出发前，我把他们的摄影机及机架，放置在车后箱内，擦清了汽车前面的遮风玻璃。我在几十辆谒陵的汽车队里，一直向前驶着。在出了中山门的途中，车内一位摄影工作队员用不熟练的中国话问我：“你会讲俄国话吗？”“不会。”——我说。“你懂英语吗？”我回答：“知道一点。”于是他用英语对我说话：“同志！这是多么美丽而富饶的山河！伟大中国人民的自由、幸福的土地。”他又问我：“你知道苏联的首都莫斯科吗？”我回答：“知道！莫斯科是苏联的也是世界上的最美丽而热闹的劳动人民的大都市，我想它比这里更美丽得多呢！”
    他又有趣地问我：“同志，你是到过莫斯科去的吗？你怎么知道它的呢？”
    “没有，我没有去过苏联。我是在读到苏联的地理、历史时，读到莫斯科的。我非常喜爱苏联的每一寸国土，在我的意识中，它好象是我们中国劳动人民自己的国土一样。”——我回答说。
    他热情地说：“亲爱的同志！中国的朋友！我们欢迎你们大家到苏联到莫斯科去参观。”
    “谢谢你！我将来一定有机会去的。”我感激地回答说。
    在陵墓前，他们介绍我与法捷耶夫团长见面，他紧握着我的手说：“你好！同志！”“你好！法捷耶夫同志。”我模拟着俄语说。他们都对我笑着，有的拍着我的肩。中午，在灵谷寺旁午餐后，我驶车送摄影队员们到天文台山上去，秋天的山路遮隐在两旁的深红色的树枝下，路旁又长着高高的山草。我们驶过了美丽的山路，到达了山顶，与驻军取得联系，开上了天文台。
    这时，我是他们的向导，因为他们没有把俄语翻译带来，我们请了天文台上的一位职员，引导我们参观了仪器，爬上了天文台上的最高峰。他们玩赏了长江和城市的风景之后，把摄影机拿上山峰，摄取了两卷片子。这时候，突然走来了七八位军政大学的学员，他们是希望来和苏联代表团见面的。幸好我懂得英语，将军大学员们的意见介绍给摄影队员们听。他们热诚地互相握手。
    那位和我能用英语交谈的摄影队员，向我提出了一个意见，要我们大家与他们在山峰上合拍几张照片，以留作国际兄弟情谊的纪念。他们每个人去轮流摄影，其余三位和我们坐在一起，坐在阳光照射的山峰上，拍摄了几个五彩镜头（这是五彩底版）。苏联朋友诚恳地说：“我们每个人都非常感觉到光荣和愉快，因为今天能够在这个山峰上与你们亲爱的中国朋友们在一起摄影，并得到你们的热烈欢迎，使我们获得非常宝贵的友谊。谢谢你们！我们要将你们所给予我们的热诚友爱与兄弟般的情谊，和这几张照片，一齐带回苏联，介绍给每一个苏联人民知道。我想在回国后，就寄几张样子来给你们看，希望得到你们的批评。”
    军大的学员叫我对代表团员们说出他们今天与苏联朋友在伟大友谊中的感想。他们一面热情地握着苏联朋友的手。代表团员笑得合不拢嘴。然后严肃认真地说：“同志们！我们是国际的亲兄弟，大家是不能分彼此的，我们两大国家要团结一致去为巩固世界民主和平的伟大的事业，为消灭帝国主义发动侵略战争的阴谋而奋斗！”
    我们也以同样的热诚说：“苏联人民是中国人民的老师，我们愿意永远做斯大林的忠实的学生，永远跟苏联人民学习。这是我们大家的任务。”
    斯大林同志万岁！
    毛泽东同志万岁！
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    我们彼此热诚地互相举手呼喊着口号。这些口号将永远地维系两大劳动人民国家的亲密情谊。我们大家唱着国际歌走下了山坡，山谷中回荡着热烈的回声。
    军大的学员们整队向他们敬礼告别，我们也驶下天文台的山路，回到招待所去休息。
    晚上，我们起程到上海去，我送他们到下关车站。告别时，他们一个个地握着我的手说：“同志，再见！”“再见！再见！”我被一种强烈的友爱情绪激动着，好象失了什么重要的东西一样与他们握手告别。
