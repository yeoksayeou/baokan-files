　　The China World Peace Congress convened in the people's capital on the "International Day of Struggle for Peace"; this congress will officially announce the establishment of the China Branch of the World Peace Congress, which will mobilize our country's 475 million people, adding a great new force to the world's people's movement to defend peace. Compel all imperialists to maintain peace and forbid war.

　　Following the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people immediately joined the great family of world peace and democracy, and took the lead in actively participating in the great ranks of defending world peace. This fully demonstrates how resolutely the Chinese people are implementing their own revolutionary charter. The "Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," which is also the policy of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, clearly stipulates: "Uphold international lasting peace and friendly cooperation between the peoples of all countries, and oppose the imperialist policies of aggression and war." Today, we will use further practical actions to turn this provision into reality. We have further united under the banner of world peace and democracy led by the Soviet Union, and together with the people of the world, launch a peaceful march against the imperialist war instigators.

　　The Chinese people have already made tremendous efforts to defend world peace. The victory of the great People's Liberation War is the result of this effort. Imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries forced the Chinese people to accept war, launching a brutal counter-revolutionary war to attack the Chinese people. However, they ultimately failed, and they have been defeated by the people's revolutionary war. We must continue to thoroughly defeat them, carry the revolution through to the end, and ensure that they never have the possibility of "restoration." The more thoroughly our revolutionary war is carried out, the more powerfully we will shatter the imperialist conspiracies to instigate new wars, and the more powerfully we will defend world peace.

　　Before the enemies of the people are completely eliminated, we will always remember Chairman Mao Zedong's instruction that the People's Liberation Army is forever a fighting force, continue to strengthen the armed forces of the Chinese people, and build a modern national defense army with great combat power in order to defend our motherland and the interests of the people, and at the same time make it a strong force for defending world peace.

　　We believe that the international peace and democracy forces led by the Soviet Union are invincible. With the support of such a powerful international force, the Chinese people will be even more confident in shouldering the glorious task of defending peace in the East, and together with the progressive people of the world, jointly win lasting world peace.

### 参加保卫世界和平的伟大行列

　　参加保卫世界和平的伟大行列
    中国保卫世界和平大会已于“国际和平斗争日”在人民的首都召开了；这个大会将正式宣布成立世界拥护和平大会中国分会，它将动员我国四万万七千五百万人民，给世界人民保卫和平的运动增添了一支伟大的新生力量。强迫一切帝国主义者保持和平，不许战争。
    在中华人民共和国宣布成立之后，中国人民立即投身于世界和平民主的大家庭中，并首先积极参加保卫世界和平的伟大行列。这充分证明了中国人民是怎样坚决地在执行着自己制订的革命大宪章。在“中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领”亦即中华人民共和国中央人民政府的施政方针中，已明确规定：“拥护国际的持久和平和各国人民间的友好合作，反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。”今天我们就用进一步的实际行动，把这一项规定变成了现实。我们已经进一步团聚在以苏联为首的世界和平民主的旗帜下，和全世界人民在一起，向帝国主义战争挑拨者举行和平大进军。
    中国人民为保卫世界和平，已经进行了极大的努力。伟大的人民解放战争的胜利，就是这一努力的结果。帝国主义与国民党反动派曾强迫中国人民接受战争，它们发动残酷的反革命战争，进攻中国人民。但是，它们终于失败了，它们已被人民革命战争所打败。我们还必须继续彻底打败它们，把革命进行到底，使它们永远没有“复辟”的可能。我们的革命战争进行愈彻底，就会愈有力地粉碎帝国主义挑拨新战争的阴谋，就会愈有力地保卫世界的和平。
    在人民的敌人还没有完全被消灭以前，我们将时刻记住毛泽东主席关于人民解放军永远是一个战斗队的指示，继续加强中国人民的武装力量，建设具有伟大战斗力的现代化国防军，以便保卫我们的祖国与人民的利益，同时使它成为保卫世界和平的一支坚强的力量。
    我们相信，以苏联为首的国际和平民主力量是不可被战胜的。在这样强大的国际力量支持之下，中国人民将更信心百倍地肩负起捍卫东方和平的光荣任务，与全世界进步人类共同赢得世界的持久和平。
