　　Learn from the Example of Songjiang, Universally Convene Municipal and County People's Representative Conferences!

    The news released by this agency yesterday regarding the Songjiang County People's Representative Conference in Jiangsu Province is a major event worthy of the attention of the people nationwide. In addition to the news about the conference, we have also published the full text of the speech by Rao Shushi, Secretary of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the main points of the speech by Yu Ke, Secretary of the Songjiang County Committee of the CPC, and the editorial of the Shanghai Jiefang Daily on this conference. We hope that readers in all regions, especially the responsible personnel of governments at all levels, will pay attention to all of these.

    Municipal and county people's representative conferences are local people's political consultative conferences, the prototype of municipal and county people's congresses, and the best and most important working method for connecting the government with the masses today. In the second half of 1947 and the first half of 1948, many counties carrying out land reform convened peasant representative conferences, and some counties also convened people's congresses, achieving good results. Since the summer of this year, many large cities have convened people's representative conferences, also with good results. The Songjiang County conference gives us a new experience, that is, in the newly liberated areas, counties can and should also convene people's representative conferences. The 286 representatives attending the Songjiang conference represented workers, peasants, youth, education, freelancers, women, industry and commerce, enlightened gentry, and leading organs of the Party, government, and military from all towns and villages in the county. During the five-day conference, they discussed and decided on the guidelines and tasks of Songjiang County's work, and discussed and decided on tax collection methods and rent and interest reduction methods related to the vital interests of the people. This enabled people from all walks of life in the county to have the opportunity to express their opinions and listen to government reports, and provided the government with significant assistance in carrying out its work in the future. There is no doubt that among the thousands of municipalities and counties already liberated nationwide, each municipality or county, like Songjiang, faces a series of urgent problems that must be solved by listening to the people's opinions and obtaining their consent. In order to solve these problems, and in order to universally convey the resolutions of the People's Political Consultative Conference to people from all walks of life throughout the country, we believe that every municipality or county should learn from the experience of Songjiang and many other cities and quickly convene people's representative conferences. This will have a great effect on completing the people's liberation war, establishing and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and overcoming the difficulties and shortcomings in the current work in various places.

### 学习松江的榜样，普遍召集市县人民代表会议！

　　学习松江的榜样，普遍召集市县人民代表会议！
    昨天本社所发展的关于江苏省松江县各界人民代表会议的消息，是值得全国人民注意的一件大事。除了关于会议的消息以外，我们还发表了中共中央华东局书记饶漱石的讲话全文，中共松江县委会书记余克的讲话要点，和上海解放日报关于这个会议的社论。所有这些，我们都希望各地的读者特别是各级人民政府的负责人员加以注意。
    市县各界人民代表会议，这就是地方性的人民政治协商会议，这就是市县人民代表大会的雏形，这就是今天联系政府与人民群众的最好的和最重要的工作方法。在一九四七年下半年和一九四八年上半年，在许多进行土地改革的县份曾经召集农民代表会议，若干县份也召集过人民代表大会，得到很好的成绩。在今年夏季以来，许多大城市又召集了各界人民代表会议，也有很好的成绩。松江县的会议，给我们的一个新的经验，就是在新解放区的县份，也同样可以和应当召集各界人民代表会议。出席松江会议的二百八十六个代表，代表着全县各市镇乡村的职工、农民、青年界、教育界、自由职业界、妇女界、工商界、开明士绅和党政军的领导机关，在五天的会议中讨论了和决定了松江县工作的方针和任务，讨论了和决定了关系人民切身利益的税收办法和减租减息办法。这样就使得全县各界人民得到了发表意见并听取政府报告的机会，使得政府在今后进行工作时得到了重大的帮助。毫无疑问，在全国已解放的一千几百个市县中，每个市或县都象松江一样，面对着一连串紧要的必须听取人民意见和获得人民同意来解决的问题。为着解决这些问题，并且为着把人民政治协商会议的决议普遍传达到全国各地各界人民中间，我们认为每个市或县都应当学习松江和其他许多城市的经验，迅速召集各界人民代表会议。这对于完成人民解放战争，建立和巩固人民民主专政，克服各地当前工作中的困难和缺点，都有伟大的作用。　【新华社北京十五日电】
