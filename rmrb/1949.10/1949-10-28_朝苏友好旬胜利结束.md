Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th. The "Korean-Soviet Friendship and Soviet Culture Decade," which began on October 14th, victoriously concluded on the 23rd. In the past ten days, people in various parts of North Korea enthusiastically participated in various activities such as celebration meetings, exhibitions, lectures, forums, and performances, and laid flowers at the Liberation Tower and the tombs of Soviet martyrs. The scale of the celebrations and the enthusiastic mood of the masses participating in various activities fully demonstrated the Korean people's ardent desire to strengthen their friendly relations with their liberator—the great Soviet Union—and to absorb the world's most advanced Soviet culture. North Korean workers, who are currently engaged in a production increase campaign, are very concerned about the experience of the Soviet Stakhanovite movement. Farmers are very interested in Michurin's theories. The translated versions of Soviet dramas and the performances of music and dance by various theater groups, as well as the crowded audiences, reflect the rapid improvement of the cultural life of the Korean people. The arrival of the Soviet art delegation on the 21st brought the celebration of the "Korean-Soviet Friendship and Soviet Culture Decade" to its climax.
