Undying Youth
    ——Commemorating Mr. Lu Xun in the First Year of the People's Motherland

    The latter half of the inscription for "Wild Grass":

    I love my wild grass, but I detest the ground decorated with wild grass.
    The earth fire runs and surges underground; once the lava erupts, it will burn away the wild grass, as well as the tall trees, and then there will be nothing that can decay.
    But I am calm and joyful. I will laugh, I will sing.
    If heaven and earth are so still, I cannot laugh and sing. Even if heaven and earth are not so still, perhaps I still cannot. With this clump of wild grass, in the midst of light and darkness, life and death, past and future, I testify before friends and foes, humans and beasts, lovers and those who do not love.

    For myself, for friends and foes, humans and beasts, lovers and those who do not love, I hope that the death and decay of this wild grass will come quickly. Otherwise, I would rather have never existed, which is even more unfortunate than death and decay.

    At that time, 1927, was precisely when Chiang Kai-shek had completed his monstrous betrayal, plunging the revolution into the "stillness" of the underground, precisely the time between light and darkness, life and death, past and future. He had to use fiery words to declare the distinction between friends and foes, humans and beasts, lovers and those who do not love, to sing praises before them of the earth fire running and surging underground, and to be certain that it would erupt one day, burning away the wild grass and tall trees. He saw the period of "I will laugh, I will sing."
    However, is it necessary for a warrior's battle manifesto or battle achievements to die and decay? Is it possible for them to die and decay?
    For the ideological warrior who "shoulders the gate of darkness," his entire wish is for the demise of darkness and the emergence of new life, and he dedicates himself to battle for this alone. Dedication is not a "desperate gamble" but "I and you perish together." "All attacks on the ills of the time must perish simultaneously with those ills, for this is like a white blood cell forming a boil; unless it is also eliminated itself, its continued existence proves that the germs are still present"; moreover, what about not just "the ills of the time" but an entire old history? This warrior of the pen must also embrace the heart of a warrior with a gun, using his bare hands to lift the explosives and the enemy's bunker, shattering them simultaneously.

    But of course, the warrior's body and the bunker are destroyed at the same time, but his spirit will shine forever. And the real life that reflects the demands of reality and emits the brilliance of battle will connect to the future and remain in the future. The analogy of the white blood cell and germs can only be taken as an expression of the determination and sincerity of battle.

    II
    Let's take another look.

    In the first year of the people's revolutionary faction's battle, with Lu Xun himself as the vanguard, 1918, we heard this voice:

    …Those who can do things, do things; those who can make a sound, make a sound. Give off one point of heat, give off one point of light; even if it's just like a firefly, it can give off a little light in the darkness, no need to wait for a torch.

    If there is no torch after all, then I will be the only light. If there is a torch, if the sun comes out, we will naturally disappear with heartfelt conviction, not only without any resentment, but also with joy and praise for this torch or sun; because it shines on humanity, including me.
    ………
    Even if it's just a puddle of shallow water, you can learn from the sea; anyway, it's all water, and it can all connect. Let them throw a few pebbles in secret; let them splash a few drops of dirty water from behind.

    Willing to be a firefly, looking forward to a torch or the sun, and considering the prospect of one's own disappearance as happiness. This spirit of selfless collectivism was also included in this brave and advancing vanguard. Even if it is not exactly the same as the collectivism we have today, it should at least be a nascent state of collectivism. Because it is a nascent state, it carries a pure color, it contains a fearless vitality.

    By the time of his death in 1936, when he temporarily broke free from death and his consciousness returned, in the silent and empty night, his first thought was of this struggling world and the people in struggle:

    The light of the street lamp shines through the window, and the room appears slightly brighter. I glance around and see the familiar walls, the edges of the walls; the familiar piles of books, the uncollected paintings beside them, the night progressing outside, the infinite distance, countless people, all related to me. I exist, I am living, I will continue to live, I begin to feel more real, I have the desire to act—but soon I fall back into sleep.

    A person's life is connected to the infinite distance, countless people, and only this existence is truly real, only this life is truly life, and one will definitely feel more real and must continue to live. Only those who can be selfless can find their true self; after eighteen years of battle and training, his collectivism reached a state of tranquil brightness, with profound feelings and inexhaustible potential.

    So, what does decay matter? What does death matter? Moreover, how can one decay, how can one die?

    III

    Power always arises from existing power and grows from it.

    The first, and most basic, source is the laboring people on the motherland's land, the pure life, the painful burdens, or the strong resilience of the laboring people. Before us appear the young Runtus ("My Old Home"), the innocent playmates ("A Village Opera"), the simple old boatmen ("A Village Opera"), and so on; then, before us appear the middle-aged Runtus, Ah Qs, Mrs. Hua and Old Shuan ("Medicine"), and so on.

    Starting from them, one can directly confront the opposing side, the coldness and cruelty of the dark forces on the motherland's land. Before us appears a mural of "man eating man," on which reign the Zhao Taiyes, Zhao Baiyans, licentiates, scholars, fake foreign devils, local bullies ("The True Story of Ah Q"), and so on.

    The young Lu Xun received such nourishment, received such baptism, so that his flesh and blood finally grew into the flesh and blood we see.

    Because he was such flesh and blood, he was able to "absorb dew, absorb water, absorb the blood and flesh of the dead" to strengthen himself; because he was such strengthened flesh and blood, when the time came for the battle to bloom, he erupted like a spring, passionately and affectionately calling out the voices in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people: "But there are always places where the devil's hands leak light, unable to cover up the light: the son of man has awakened; he knows that there should be love among humans…" ("Hot Wind"). There should be love, which means there should be struggle, which must be achieved through struggle.

    In this way, revolutionary humanism surged forth for the first time on the ancient land of China. Flowing through it was the fiery blood of the people or of class nature, and how could it not exert a brilliant and strong attraction on the tens of millions of "sons of man" who were beginning to become conscious, the advanced elements of the laboring people?

    Therefore, in the first year of launching the battle, the second year of the Russian Revolution, 1918, he immediately "saw a glimmer of dawn in the Russian Revolution, which is the dawn of a new century," calling on us to "raise our heads" to this dawn.

    Therefore, in the middle of the battle, he again announced in clear and summarizing words: "...only the emerging proletarians have a future."

    The internal basis of Lu Xun's battle initiation, or the battle initiation of the people's revolutionary faction, was of course the rise of the Chinese bourgeoisie during the European War and the simultaneous development and awakening of the proletariat, but for Lu Xun or the people's revolutionary faction, regardless of how it was in terms of logical subjective understanding, it was born on the side of the proletariat, full of the laboring people's fiery desire, rushing to the front line with the spirit of nascent collectivism.

    IV

    However, since he is the son of man, then of course he is not the son of God. He still has to develop along with the battle, and his spirit of collectivism still has to develop along with the battle.

    The battle has friends on one side and enemies on the other.

    Towards enemies, one must "open one's eyes to see," seeing more and more clearly, seeing more and more deeply. He himself once used the analogy of the giant in Greek mythology, passionately embracing his enemy in order to kill him; or, in his own words, to "strike back and easily deal a fatal blow to the strong enemy." "Absorb the blood and flesh of the dead"; nurture and strengthen oneself with the recognition and hatred of the enemy.

    Towards friends, towards the people, one must have "revolutionary love in the masses," one must "look underground," pursuing "from ancient times, we have had people who bury their heads in hard work, people who risk their lives in hard work, people who plead for the people, people who sacrifice themselves to seek the law,… these are the backbones of China." "Absorb dew, absorb water"; in order to achieve internal metabolism, so that one can "squeeze out milk, blood."

    Then, when it comes to needing to hold onto something, when it comes to needing to abandon something, can one not "wholeheartedly" follow the demands of collectivism?

    He himself said: "I do dissect others from time to time, but even more so, I dissect myself more mercilessly."

    He himself said: "When it comes to touching the places where my own scars are, I grit my teeth and endure…"

    If an ideological warrior does not want his battle demands to be tested, then why is he fighting, and how can he fight? To put it another way, if a collectivist does not go through self-criticism or self-struggle to gain the strength of battle, then how can he be a collectivist, and what is there to dedicate?

    However, this is not the same as allowing flies to spread filth at will, nor is it the same as bowing and thanking the "pebbles" thrown in secret and the "dirty water" splashed from behind, even if they are thrown and splashed by seemingly "friends." Because self-criticism or self-struggle is for the pursuit of truth, for more effectively attacking the enemy, and is definitely not for winning the reputation of a humble gentleman. In the process of battle, it is inevitable that some people use "self-criticism" that is irrelevant or does not enter the degree of pain as a shield, relying on this to immediately turn around and slander friends as enemies, confusing the false with the true, but that is not the same thing as true self-criticism.

    And a sincere ideological warrior, although he can never "use a deceiving heart and a deceiving mouth" towards himself or his comrades-in-arms, always develops and advances in self-struggle, but towards "resentful enemies," even when he is exhausted and dying, he will "not forgive a single one"!

    V

    It is in this way that one can persevere in battle, even in the most difficult times, even when "my heart is extraordinarily lonely," one can persevere in battle. Because, on the other hand, he is connected to and related to "the infinite distance, countless people," able to "resist the attack of the dark night in the void."

    He can continue his efforts—

    "How can you not know that my youth has passed? But I believe that the youth outside myself still exists…"

    He will also want to advance but be unable to—

    "Why is it so lonely? Could it be that even the youth outside myself has passed away, and the youth in the world are mostly aging?"

    However, an ideological warrior, an ideological warrior nourished by the people and tempered by the devil's fire, he will resolutely advance. —

    "If I still have to steal a living in this vague 'vanity,' then I will still seek the lost, sad, and ethereal youth, but it may as well be outside myself…"

    Here, a solemn and magnificent realm gushes out from the "sad and ethereal" expression. Because, as long as one relies on the youth outside oneself, then one is connected to the infinite distance, countless people, "the earth is still young," the youth in the world have not and will never age, the youth outside oneself not only exists, but is also surging. The great revolution is advancing, the old China is boiling, and the youth of history is budding.

    "Before me, there is actually no real dark night."

    Sincere battle is always optimistic, always carrying a joyful melody, or at least eliciting a joyful melody through pain.

    A trained collectivist warrior, even in a secluded room away from the crowd, even in a solitary cell, is still a collectivist warrior. The youth outside oneself—the people's thirst and the class's friendship pour into his heart, filling him with vigorous youthful energy, enabling him to pass through the ice age, enabling him to conquer the dark night! Even if the flesh decays and dies, the flame of that youth has already burned brightly outside oneself, never to be extinguished!

    Only collectivist warriors can reach the future and create the future. If one is a collectivist warrior, one will definitely be able to reach the future and create the future.

    VI

    Today, the torch has risen, the sun has come out, illuminating China, illuminating humanity in the name of Mao Zedong Thought, including him.

    However, he has not "disappeared," he is laughing, he is singing.

    "When I become dust, I will smile"; he is smiling, the smile in his clear and watery eyes, the smile under his stubborn toothbrush mustache.

    He is smiling, at his motherland, which is becoming younger;

    He is smiling, at the great laboring people who have not only conquered the dark night and death, but are also embarking on the creation of history with youthful vitality;

    He is smiling, at the millions of young lives who are shedding the "burden of inheritance" and joyfully striving towards collectivism;

    He is smiling, he is certain that the laboring people and the young lives will overcome the difficulties within and without, and victoriously create the youth of the motherland, the youth of the people, the youth of humanity under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　不死的青春
    ——在人民祖国的第一年纪念鲁迅先生
    胡风
    一
    “野草”题辞底后半段：
    我自爱我的野草，但我憎恶以野草作装饰的地面。
    地火在地下运行，奔突；熔岩一且喷出，将烧尽野草，以及乔木，于是并且无可朽腐。
    但我坦然，欣然。我将大笑，我将歌唱。
    天地有如此静穆，我不能大笑而且歌唱。天地即不如此静穆，我或者也将不能。我以这一丛野草，在明与暗，生与死，过去与未来之际，献于友与仇，人与兽，爱者与不爱者之前作证。
    为我自己，为友与仇，人与兽，爱者与不爱者，我希望这野草的死亡与朽腐，火速到来。要不然，我先将未曾生存，这实在比死亡与朽腐更其不幸。
    当时，一九二七年，正是蒋介石完成了罪恶滔天的叛变，把革命打入了地下的“静穆”的时间，正是明与暗，生与死，过去与未来之际，他不得不用火热的字句宣布了友与仇，人与兽，爱者与不爱者的分别，在他们之前歌颂了在地下运行、奔突的地火，而且确信会一旦喷出，将烧尽野草和乔木。他看见了“我将大笑，我将歌唱”的时期。
    然而，战士底战书或者战绩，有必要死亡与朽腐么？能够死亡与朽腐么？
    在“肩住黑暗的阐门”的思想战士，他的全部愿望是黑暗底灭亡和新生底出现，他只是为了这而献身战斗的。献身，不是“孤注一掷”而是“余及汝偕亡”。“凡对于时弊的攻击，文字须与时弊同时灭亡，因为这正如白血轮之酿成疮疖一般，倘非自身也被排除，则当它的生命的存留中，也即证明着病菌尚在”；更何况不只是“时弊”而是一部旧的历史？这个“地面”用笔的战士也得抱着用枪的战士底心，用肉手托起炸药和敌人底碉堡同时粉碎。
    但当然，战士底肉体和碉堡同时灭亡了，但他的精神将永远照耀。而反映了现实要求，而且发生了战斗光采的真实的生命，是会通到将来，且要留到将来的。白血轮和病菌的比喻，是只能当作为了说出战斗的决心和战斗的诚心。
    二
    再看一看罢。
    在以鲁迅自己为冲锋兵的人民革命派底第一个战斗年度，一九一八年，我们就听到了这样的声音：
    ……能做事的做事，能发声的发声。有一分热，发一分光；就令营火一般，也可以在黑暗里发一点光，不必等候炬火。
    此后如竟没有炬火，我便是惟一的光。倘若有了炬火，出了太阳，我们自然心悦诚服的消失，不但毫无不平，而且还要随喜赞美这炬火或太阳；因为他照了人类，连我都在内。
    ………
    纵令不过一洼浅水，也可以学学大海；横竖都是水，可以相通。几粒石子，任他们暗地里掷来；几滴秽水，任他们从背后泼来就是了。
    甘为萤火，期待炬火或太阳，而且以预计自己的消失为幸福。在这个勇迈前进的冲锋兵里面，同时就包含了这种无我的集体主义的精神。即使并不就完全等于今天我们所有的集体主义，但至少也应该是集体主义底一种初生状态了。因为是初生状态，它带着纯净的色采，它含着无畏的生意。
    到了他逝世的一九三六年，当从死亡暂时挣脱了出来，意识恢复了的时候，深夜静无人声，他的第一个思想就是这个斗争着的世界和斗争中的人们：
    街灯的光穿窗而入，屋子里显出微明，我大略一看，熟识的墙壁，墙壁的棱线；熟识的书堆，堆边的未订的画集，外面的进行着的夜，无穷的远方，无数的人们，都和我有关。我存在着，我在生活，我将生活下去，我开始觉得自己更切实了，我有动作的欲望——但不久我又坠入了睡眠。
    一个人底生命和无穷的远方，无数的人们相通相关，这存在才是真的存在，这生活才是真的生活，就一定会觉得自己更切实，而且非生活下去不止了。只有能够无我者才能够找到真我；经过了十八年的战斗和锻炼，他的集体主义达到了一种沉静光明的境地，有着深远的感受，含着无尽的潜力。
    那么，朽腐算什么呢？死亡算什么呢？而且，怎样会朽腐，怎样会死亡呢？
    三
    力量总是从存在着的力量产生出来，生长起来的。
    第一个，而且是最基本的源泉是祖国大地上的劳动的人民，劳动人民底纯真的生命，痛苦的负担或坚强的韧力。我们面前出现了年幼的闰土们（“故乡”），天真的游伴们（“社戏”）朴实的老船夫们（“社戏”）等等；接着，我们面前出现了中年的闰土们，阿Ｑ们，华大妈和老栓们（“药”）等等。
    从他们出发，就能够正眼地直对反对的方面，祖国大地上的黑暗势力底冷酷和２凶狠。我们前面出现了一幅“人吃人”的壁画，那上面君临着赵太爷们，赵白眼们，举人们，秀才们，假洋鬼子们，地保们（“阿Ｑ正传”）等等。
    幼童的鲁迅，受到了这样的哺养，受到了这样的洗礼，使他的血肉之身终于生长成了我们所看见的血肉之身。
    因为是这样的血肉之身，所以才能够“吸取露，吸取水，吸取陈死人的血肉”来壮大自己；因为是这样壮大起来了的血肉之身，所以，一到战斗底发花期的时候，就喷泉爆发似的，深情而又多情地叫出了亿万人所有的心里的声音：“可是魔鬼手上，终有漏光的处所，掩不住光明：人之子醒了；他知道人类间应有爱情……。”（“热风”）。应有爱情，也就是说应有斗争，一定要通过斗争。
    就这样，革命的人道主义，破天荒地在古老中国大地上面奔涌出来了。那里面流贯着人民性或阶级性的火热的血液，对于千万的开始自觉的“人之子”们，劳动人民底先进分子们，怎样能够不发生光华而又坚强的吸力呢？
    所以，在发动战斗的第一个年度，俄国革命底第二年，一九一八年，他就马上从俄罗斯大革命里面“看出一种薄明的天色，便是新世纪的曙光”，号召我们向这个曙光“抬起头”来。
    所以，到了战斗的中途，又用总结性的明确的字句宣布了：“…惟有新兴的无产者才有将来”。
    鲁迅底战斗开端，或者说人民革命派底战斗开端，那内在的根据当然是在欧战期间中国资产阶级底勃起和同时俱来的无产阶级底发育和觉醒，但对鲁迅或人民革命派说来，不管在逻辑性的主观认识上如何，却是诞生在无产者这一边，满怀着劳动人民底火热的渴求，带着初生的集体主义的精神冲上前线的。
    四
    然而，既然是人之子，那就当然不是神之子。他还要和战斗一同发展，他的集体主义的精神还要和战斗一同发展的。
    战斗，一边是友，一边是仇。
    对于仇，要“睁了眼看”，愈看愈清，愈看愈深，他自己曾经用譬喻说过，象希腊神话里的巨人，热烈地拥抱他的敌人，为了把他摔死；或者用他自己的话说，为了“反戈一击，易致强敌的死命”。“吸取陈死人的血肉”；以对于敌人的认识和憎恨来养育自己，壮大自己。
    对于友，对于人民，要“革命之爱在大众”，要“看地底下”，追求“我们从古以来，就有埋头苦干的人，有拼命硬干的人，有为民请命的人，有舍身求法的人，……这就是中国的脊梁”。“吸取露，吸取水”；为了得到身内的新陈代谢，因而才能够“挤出的是牛奶，血”。
    那么，对于自己，临到需要执着什么的时候，临到需要割弃什么的时候，还能够不“心悦诚服”地顺着集体主义的要求的么？
    他自己说：“我的确时时解剖别人，然而更多的是更无情面的解剖我自己。”
    他自己说：“到了打着自己的疮痕的去处，我就咬紧牙关忍受……。”
    一个思想战士，如果他的战斗要求不愿经过考验，那他是为什么作战，又怎样能够作战呢？换一个说法，如要一个集体主义者不通过自我批评或自我斗争去获得战斗的实力，又怎样能够是集体主义者，有什么值得献出的呢？
    然而，这并不是等于应该让苍蝇们来随便撒污，也不等于应该向暗地里掷来的“石子”和背后泼来的“秽水”鞠身致谢，即使那是貌似的“友人”掷来泼来的。因为，自我批评或自己斗争是为了追求真理，是为了更有效地打击敌人，决不是为了赢得一个谦谦君子的名誉的。在战斗过程中，难免有以不关痛痒处的或不到进入痛痒程度的“自我批评”做盾牌，靠了这，马上反过去污友为敌，以伪乱真的现象，但那和真的自我批评是并非一事的。
    而真诚的思想战士，虽然对于自己，对于战友，绝不能“以欺瞒的心，用欺瞒的嘴”，总是在自我斗争中发展前进，但对于“怨敌”，就是到了力尽倒毙的时候，是“也一个都不宽恕”的！
    五
    是这样，才能够坚持战斗，即使在最艰难的时候，即使在“我的心分外地寂寞”的时候，也能够坚持战斗。因为，另一面，他正是和“无穷的远方，无数的人们”相通相关，能够“抗拒那空虚中的暗夜的袭来”。
    他能够再接再厉——
    “岂不知我的青春已经逝去了？但以为身外的青春固在……”
    他也会欲进不能进——
    “何以如此寂寞？难道连身外的青春也都逝去，世上的青年也多衰老了么？”
    然而，思想战士，经过了人民底哺养和魔火底锻炼的思想战士，他是要决然前进的。——
    “倘使我还得偷生在不明不暗的这‘虚妄’中，我就还要寻求那逝去的悲凉漂渺的青春，但不妨在我的身外。……”
    到这里，从“悲凉漂渺”的表情里面就奔涌出庄严宏大的境界了。因为，只要依靠身外的青春，那就通到了无穷的远方，无数的人们，“地球正在年青”，世上的青年没有也决不会衰老，身外的青春不但固在，而且还正在汹涌澎湃呢。大革命正在进军，旧中国正在沸腾，历史的青春正在含苞欲放。
    “面前又竟至于并没有真的暗夜。”
    真诚的战斗，总是乐观主义的，总是带着欢乐的旋律，至少也是通过苦痛而引发出欢乐的旋律的。
    经过了锻炼的集体主义的战士，即使在离群的斗室里面，在单人的牢房里面，也还是集体主义的战士。身外的青春——人民底渴求和阶级的友爱倾注到了他的心里，使他充满了蓬勃的青春热力，能够通过冰河时代，能够征服暗夜！即使肉体朽腐，死亡了，但那青春的火焰已经熊熊地燃在身外，永不熄灭！
    只有集体主义的战士才能通到将来，创造将来。是集体主义的战士，就一定能够通到将来，创造将来。
    六
    今天，炬火升起了，太阳出来了，那用毛泽东思想的名字照耀着中国，照耀着人类，连他都在内。
    然而，他并没有“消失”，他在大笑，他在歌唱。
    “待我成尘时我将微笑”；他在微笑，微笑在他那明净如水的目光里面，微笑在他那倔强不屈的牙刷胡子下面。
    他在微笑，对着他的正在年青起来了的祖国；
    他在微笑，对着不但征服了暗夜和死亡，而且正在年青的活力里面着手创造历史的伟大的劳动人民；
    他在微笑，对着正在解除掉“因袭的重担”，欢乐地向集体主义努力前进的，千千万万的年青的生命；
    他在微笑，他确信劳动的人民和年青的生命们在毛泽东思想的指引下面一定会克服身外身内的困难，胜利地创造出祖国底青春，人民底青春，人类底青春。
