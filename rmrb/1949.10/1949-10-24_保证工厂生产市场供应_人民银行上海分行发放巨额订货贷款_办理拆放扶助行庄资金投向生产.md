    Handling Interbank Lending to Assist Banks and Firms with Capital Investment in Production
    [Special Dispatch] To develop production and prosper the economy, the People's Bank of China Shanghai Branch began offering order loans on August 26th. The Shanghai General Trade Company, Shanghai Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, and Shanghai Daily Necessities Company have applied for many order loans through the bank. This month, to further promote production, ensure workers have jobs, and enable factories to have circulating capital, the bank has again issued several order loans, including orders for 9,000 baskets of Arrow brand wood thread from China Flying Wheel Thread Factory; 3,000 dozen Goose brand undershirts and trousers from Wuhe Weaving Factory; 2,000 dozen Monk Cap brand undershirts and trousers from Gonghe Cotton Weaving Factory; 2,000 dozen Flying Horse brand undershirts and trousers from Jingfu Shirt and Socks Factory; 6,000 bolts of plain-colored twill fabric from Gong Sheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory; 3,000 bolts of Hong Zhang blue cloth from Hong Zhang Textile Dyeing Factory; 3,000 bolts of Student blue cloth from Hua Feng Dyeing and Weaving Factory; 3,000 bolts of Yongxin Shilin cloth from Yongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory; and 6,000 bolts of Red Man brand printed serge from Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory. A total of 2 billion RMB has been loaned out. The government can also recover large quantities of goods to supply the market as needed, playing a significant role in stabilizing market prices.

    Furthermore, to support private silver shops, money shops and trust companies in investing capital in production, the bank has formulated the "Provisional Measures of the People's Bank of China Shanghai Branch for Handling Interbank Lending to Member Banks, Firms, and Companies of the Shanghai Private Silver Shops, Money Shops and Trust Companies Joint Lending Office." It stipulates that when member banks, firms, and companies of the Shanghai Private Silver Shops, Money Shops and Trust Companies Joint Lending Office face tight market credit, reduced deposits, and delayed loan recoveries, resulting in insufficient cash reserves to meet payments, they may, with the bank's approval, apply for interbank lending to meet temporary working capital needs.
