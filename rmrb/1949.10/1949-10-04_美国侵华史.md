　　American Aggression Against China
    Four: Exclusive Control of China
    (Continued from Twenty-Eight)
    In addition, the United States continuously cultivated He Yingqin of the "Central Government," Bai Chongxi in Central China, Sun Liren in Taiwan, and Ma Hongda in the Northwest. Especially towards Fu Zuoyi, who was entrenched in North China, the United States even planned to supply a large amount of military fire separately to militarily support him. In August 1948, Lappham, the executor of the U.S. aid to Chiang Kai-shek plan, publicly stated in Peiping: he would "suggest drawing some from the $125 million military plan to defend the North China construction invested by the ECA..." Even Feng Yuxiang, who was squeezed out by Chiang Kai-shek and wandered to the United States, was still being courted. The U.S. government sent someone to express to Feng that "Our U.S. government is against the Communist Party and can never cooperate with the Communist Party. As long as you don't want the Communist Party, our U.S. government is willing to help you greatly, with plenty of money and military fire," when Feng Yuxiang firmly refused, they insisted on giving him "six months" to "consider." It finally ended in "disagreement" (Note: Feng Yuxiang's letter to Li Jishen, published in the World Daily, September 21, 1948). All of this is a manifestation of the United States not giving up on using any opportunity to exercise various tricks.
    No matter how hard the American aggressors worked, in the three years after Japan's surrender, the steps it took to defeat the Chinese people, politically, from "cooperation," to "non-cooperation," to organizing negotiations, to pretending to mediate, to openly taking one side; militarily, from equipping the Chiang army, to military occupation, to transporting troops, to directing operations, to direct attacks, have all completely failed. This is also the result of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people correctly struggling step by step, exposing step by step.
    However, the deaths of Chinese people, the plundered wealth of the Chinese people and the nation, and the violation of Chinese sovereignty caused by the United States in these aggressive steps are already too numerous to express in numbers. Although only three short years, its harm has not only exceeded the sum of more than 100 years of aggression against China by other imperialist powers but is also no less than the total crimes of Japan's eight-year occupation of China. This is a blood debt owed by the American aggressors to the Chinese people.
    In terms of slaughtering the Chinese people—the United States used "aid to China" to transfer a large number of American killing machines and the latest killing techniques, in the name of loans, leases, relief, transfers...through Chiang Kai-shek's hands, to slaughter the Chinese people. In the three years after Japan's surrender, the total value of weapons and equipment shipped by the United States to China reached as much as US$5,134,982,223! Exceeding a quarter of the total amount of aid made by the United States to reactionaries in various countries after World War II, which totaled US$20 billion. Although it is impossible to write all of its contents in detail here, some scattered materials can be cited to get a general idea, such as:
    Aircraft, the "Eighth One Third Air Force Plan" alone, included a heavy bomber group, a medium bomber group, four single-engine fighter groups, and two photographic reconnaissance squadrons, totaling 1,071 aircraft. By March 1948, at least 936 had been delivered, and the rest were being delivered. According to another statistic, 1,150 had been shipped before January 1947 (Note: People's Daily, March 3, 1948, and Liao Gailong's article in the same newspaper, March 16, 1947).
    Warships, three cruisers, forty-five destroyers, together with combat, landing, and other vessels, totaled 250 ships, plus other ships, for a total of 471 ships (Note: According to the U.S.-Chiang secret military agreement, People's Daily, May 22, 1948. According to another statistic, March 20 of the same year, the Associated Press reported that there were already 271 warships).
    Petroleum, in the first quarter (spring) of 1948 alone, Chiang Kai-shek was given 60,088 barrels of aviation gasoline, 350,000 barrels of other engine gasoline, 85,000 barrels of kerosene, and 100,000 barrels of fuel oil (Note: Announced by the U.S. Department of Commerce, United Press Washington, February 10, 1948).
    Vehicles, up to January 1947, 67,000 vehicles of various types, and a large number of tanks.
    Guns and artillery, one item in the secret U.S.-Chiang military agreement approved by the U.S. government in June 1946 included 750 mountain guns, 1,500 light guns, 5,000 mortars, 15,000 heavy machine guns, 17,000 light machine guns, and 600,000 automatic rifles.
    Bullets, one bullet transaction on June 27, 1947, was for more than 130 million rounds, which, according to the total population of the entire liberated area at that time, was exactly one round per person.
    Unified Equipment. The same military agreement also stipulated that the U.S. government would equip 75 divisions of the Chiang army before 1950. According to another statistic, by January 1947, 64 divisions, 18 traffic police corps, 20 security regiments, and a parachute battalion, totaling 840,000 people, had already been equipped.
    Training the Chiang Army. In addition to continuing to run the original staff training school, infantry school, Sino-U.S. mixed air force school, two Sino-U.S. joint army training schools, and five Sino-U.S. special training classes, new Nanjing automobile training school, Qingdao naval training school, Kunming signal corps school, Kunming, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Hengyang parachute force training school, Chongqing special technician training school, Hangzhou air force training school, Chengdu air force school, Suzhou mechanized school, Nanjing infantry and artillery school, Hankou, Shanghai, Xuzhou air force instructors and military technical personnel schools...and other twenty or thirty places were established to train sea, air, infantry, artillery, light and heavy, automobile, communications, paratroopers, transportation, secret service, staff, military supplies, military doctors...and other fourteen or fifteen ten thousand people. In the air force alone, there were more than 5,100 pilots, bombers, airspace personnel, and technicians.
    In addition, the United States also supplied Chiang Kai-shek with a large number of incendiary bombs, chemical warfare equipment, various military parts, etc...
    Wallace, the leader of the American "Progressive Party," delivered a speech on May 21, 1948, summarizing the U.S. policy toward China, saying: "In the past three years, the United States has shipped an average of eight and a half times more weapons to China per month than we shipped to China per month from the Pearl Harbor incident to the victory over Japan," he deeply felt that the hands of American aggressors were "stained with the blood of countless Chinese people" (Note: Taihang Xinhua Daily, June 3, 1948). Not only that, the United States also instructed its vassal Canadian government to continue to supply Chiang's army with 2,500 tons of machine gun bullets and other military fire after providing Chiang with US$60 million and 150 "Mosquito" bombers in one aid package. The United States itself, in sporadic cash transactions, sold various military fire to Chiang Kai-shek. According to an estimate by a magazine in Beijing, in formal trade alone, in 1947 alone, Chiang's "Resources Committee" foreign exchange for purchasing American military fire was more than US$130 million (Note: Huang Zhuo: Foreign Trade in the KMT-controlled area in June 1946, People's Daily, March 1, 1948).
    As for the insulting, raping, killing, looting, etc. crimes committed directly by the American occupation forces against the Chinese people in the posture of conquerors, they are everywhere and cannot be counted.
    In terms of plundering the wealth of the Chinese people and the nation—the United States used various special powers to dump goods, import capital, and seize production raw materials in China without limit. In the three years after Japan's surrender, the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors of the Chinese people's livelihood, such as clothing, food, and housing, gradually fell completely into the hands of the American aggressors, causing the wealth of the Chinese people and the nation to increasingly flow to the United States. Such as:
    General Enterprises. Focusing on South China, according to a United Press report on August 12, 1947: American entrepreneurs have formulated a "huge plan to develop the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan," with a capital of US$150 million to implement the plan, and the scope of operations includes Guangzhou gas plant, cement plant, glass factory... etc. The implementation contract was signed in early August by the American Penny Lees Company. On September 13 of the same year, Song Ziwen, the American lackey, took over Guangdong. On October 2, American oil tycoon Rockefeller III came to Guangdong to discuss with Song the development of mineral resources in Guangdong and reached an agreement. On October 13, the Vice President of Penny Lee Company contacted Song on investing in other industries and businesses in Guangdong Province, and a decision was soon made. On October 15, Mr. Gilbert, Counselor of the U.S. Embassy, went to Guangdong to have a "wide exchange of views on business in South China" with Song.
    Petroleum and Electricity. In 1946, the United States ordered the Chiang government to promulgate the so-called "New Company Law." Before and after this, the American big trust, the Globe Production Company, began to explore and exploit petroleum in Northwest China. The American Westinghouse Electric Company also established a large-scale factory in China. On New Year's Day in 1948, the American-controlled "Shanghai Electric Power United Company" was established in Shanghai with a total capital of US$23 million, of which the American syndicate invested US$13 million, accounting for more than 50%. In addition to operating electricity, the United Company also undertakes investment rights in Shanghai's public and private roads, rivers, bridges, ditches, street ports, and any public property. American companies can also freely invest in other electric power companies in Shanghai.

　　美国侵华史
    四　独占中国
    （续二十八）
    此外，美国对“中央”的何应钦，华中的白崇禧，台湾的孙立人，西北的马鸿达等也不断培植，特别是对困踞华北的傅作义，还打算单独供给大量军火，从军事上来扶植他，一九四八年八月，美国援蒋计划执行人莱普汉在北平公开说：他将“建议自一亿二千五百万元军事计划中抽出若干，以保卫经合局投资的华北建设……”，即对被蒋介石排挤而流浪至美国的冯玉祥也还企图拉拢利用，美政府派专人对冯表示“我们美国政府是反对共产党的，是决不能给共产党合作的，只要你们不要共产党，我们美国政府愿意帮你们的大忙，用钱用军火有的是”，当被冯玉祥坚决拒绝时，又一定要为他“六个月的时间”去“考虑考虑”。最后落得个“不欢而散”（注：冯玉祥给李济深的信，载一九四八年九月二十一日世界日报。）。这全是美国还不放弃利用任何机会，行使各种诡计的表现。
    不管美国侵略者如何用尽心机，在日本投降后的三年内，它为打败中国人民所经过的步骤，在政治上，由“合作”，而不“合作”，而组织谈判，而伪装调处，而公开一面倒；在军事上，由装备蒋军，而军事占领，而运兵，而指挥作战，而直接进攻，都全部彻底失败了，这又正是中国共产党与中国人民正确地一步一步斗争，一步一步揭露的结果。
    但是，美国在这一些侵略步骤中，所造成中国人生命的死亡，抢走的中国人民与国家财富，侵犯的中国主权，却已经多得无法用数字表示出来了。虽只短短三年，其危害则不仅把其他帝国主义一百余年侵略中国的总和都已超过，即比起日本八年占领中国的全部罪恶也毫无不及。这是美国侵略者所欠下中国人民的一笔血债。
    在屠杀中国人民方面——美国用“援华”方式，把大批美国杀人利器与最新式的杀人技术，以借款、租借、救济、让予………等名义，经过蒋介石的手，拿来屠杀中国人民。日本投降后三年内，美国运到中国的武器与装备，总值竟达五十一万万零三百四十九万八千二百二十三美元之多！超过第二次世界大战后，美国对世界各国反动派所作援助总数二百万万美元的四分之一。这里虽不能详写它的全部内容，可举出些零星材料，以见一般，如：
    飞机，“八一三分之一队空军计划”一项，即有一个重轰炸机大队，一个中型轰炸机大队，四个单引擎战斗机大队，两个摄影侦察机中队，共一千零七十一架。到一九四八年三月，至少有九百三十六架已经交清，其余正在运交。据另一统计，一九四七年一月以前，已运到一千一百五十架（注：民国三十七年三月三日人民日报及三十六年三月十六日同报廖盖隆文）。
    军舰，巡洋舰三艘，驱逐舰四十五艘，连同战斗，登陆等舰艇共二百五十艘，加入其他船只，为四百七十一艘（注：据美蒋秘密军事协定，载民国三十七年五月二十二日人民日报。另一统计，同年三月二十日同报资料所据美联社电讯，当时已有军舰二百七十一艘）。
    石油，仅一九四八年第一季（春季）即运给蒋介石飞机用汽油六万零八十八桶，其他发动机汽油三十五万桶，火油八万五千桶，煤油及蒸料燃料油十万桶（注：美商务部公布，一九四八年二月十日合众社华盛顿电）。
    车辆，止一九四七年一月以前，各种车六万七千辆，大批坦克在外。
    枪炮，一九四六年六月美政府批准的美蒋秘密军事协定一项，即有山炮七百五十门，轻炮一千五百门，迫击炮五千门，重机枪一万五千挺，轻机枪一万七千挺，自动步枪六十万枝。
    子弹，一九四七年六月二十七日一次子弹交易，即为一万万三千余发，按当时全解放区人口合计，恰为每人一发。
    统一装备。同前项军事协定又规定：美政府在一九五○年以前，装备蒋军七十五个师。照另一统计，一九四七年一月以前，已经装备六十四个师，十八个交通警察总队，二十个保安团，及伞兵大队，共八十四万人。
    训练蒋军。除续办原有参谋训练学校，步兵学校，中美混合空军学校，两个中美联合陆军训练学校，五个中美特别训练班外，又新设南京汽车训练学校，青岛海军训练学校，昆明信号部队学校，昆明、南京、广州、衡阳降落伞部队训练学校，重庆特别技师训练学校，杭州空军训练学校，成都空军学校，苏州机械化学校，南京步炮学校，汉口、上海、徐州空军教官与军事技术人员学校……等二三十处，训练海、空、步、炮、轻重、汽车、通讯、伞兵、交通、特务、参谋、军需、军医……等十四、五万人。单是空军一项，即有飞行员，轰炸手，领空和技师等五千一百余人。
    此外，美国还供给蒋介石大量烧夷弹，化学战具，各种军用零件等等……
    美国“进步党”首领华莱士一九四八年五月二十一日发表讲演总结美国对华政策说：“过去三年中，美国平均每月运给中国武器，为珍珠港事变至对日胜利期间我们每月运给中国武器之八倍半”，他深深感到美国侵略者的手上“染满了无数中国人民的鲜血”（注：民国三十七年六月三日，太行新华日报。）不仅如此，美国还指使它的附庸加拿大政府于一次援蒋六千万美元与“蚊式”轰炸机一百五十架后，又继续供蒋军机枪子弹二千五百吨及其他军火。美国自己更在零星付现的交易中，额外以各种军火售予蒋介石，据北京一家杂志估计，在正式贸易之外，仅一九四七年一年，蒋“资源委员会”购买美国军火一项外汇，即在一万万三千万美元以上（注：黄灼：一九四六年六月蒋管区对外贸易，民国三十七年三月一日，人民日报）。
    至于美国占领军以征服者姿态直接施于中国人民的殴辱、强奸、杀身、越货，……等罪恶行为，更到处皆是，无法悉数。
    在抢掠中国人民与国家财富方面——美国利用各种特别权力，向中国无限止的倾销商品，输入资本与夺取生产原料，日本投降后三年内，中国人取得衣、食、住等生活资料的农、工、商业逐步地完全落入美国侵略者的掌握，使中国人民与国家财富日益增多的向美国流去。如：
    一般企业。以华南为重点，据一九四七年八月十二日合众社电：美国企业家已拟定“开发广东，广西，湖南三省之庞大计划”，实现计划资金为一万万五千万美元，经营范围有广州煤气厂，水泥厂，玻璃厂……等。实施合同已在八月初由美国潘尼李氏公司出面订立。同年九月十三日，美国走狗宋子文接管广东，十月二日，又有美国煤油大王洛克菲勒第三来粤与宋商谈开展广东矿藏问题，并取得协议。十月十三日潘尼李公司副总裁与宋接洽投资粤省其他工商业，随即有所决定。十月十五日美大使馆参赞纪伯荻又到广东与宋“广泛交换对华南商务意见”。
    石油与电力。一九四六年，美国命令蒋政府颁布所谓“新公司法”，在这前后，美国大托辣斯寰球生产公司开始在中国西北探测与开采石油。美国威斯汀好斯电汽公司也在华设立大规模工厂。一九四八年元旦，上海又成立美国控制的“上海电力联合公司”，资金共二千三百万美元，美银团即投入一千三百万，占百分之五十以上。联合公司除经营电力外，还包揽上海公私道路，河流，桥梁，沟渠，街港及任何公产上的投资权利。上海其他电力公司美国亦可自由投资。
