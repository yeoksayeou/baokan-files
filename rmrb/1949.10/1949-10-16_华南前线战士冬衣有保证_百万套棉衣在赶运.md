Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 15th -- Winter clothing for soldiers on the South China Front is guaranteed. One million sets of cotton-padded uniforms are being rushed to the front.

　　The million sets of new cotton military uniforms supplying the large army on the Central China Front have already begun to be transported to the front lines. These uniforms, including all the winter equipment for the Fourth Field Army and the local troops of the Central China Military Region — overcoats, cotton hats, leggings, shoes, socks, ammunition pouches, food bags, raincoats, rain tarps, vehicle canvas, belts, artillery equipment, etc. — were manufactured by the Quartermaster Department of the Northeast Military Region at the end of June this year, and began to be shipped south in August. The new cotton uniforms were made after listening to the opinions of the soldiers and adapting to the climate and other conditions in the south. The new cotton uniforms are well-fitting, comfortable, and aesthetically pleasing, and are much appreciated by the soldiers; the cloth shoes are sturdy and convenient, and will not fall off even when marching in muddy conditions. All the new cotton uniforms are now being transported to the front lines and various provinces by rail, road, and waterway. The winter clothing of the brave soldiers who are eliminating the remaining enemies in South China and suppressing bandits in various provinces is now guaranteed.
