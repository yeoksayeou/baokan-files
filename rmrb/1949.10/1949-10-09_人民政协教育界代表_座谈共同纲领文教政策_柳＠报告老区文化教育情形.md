Representatives of Education Circles in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Discuss the Common Program's Cultural and Educational Policies
Liu Reports on the Cultural and Educational Situation in Old Liberated Areas

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Education Workers' Representative Conference hosted a discussion on the cultural and educational policies in the Common Program on October 7th for representatives of the education circles in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Dong Biwu, the director of the Preparatory Committee, delivered a speech, followed by Huang Yanpei, who explained the drafting process and content of the cultural and educational section in the Common Program. Subsequently, attendees spoke one after another, explaining the cultural and educational policies from various aspects such as higher education, secondary education, mass education, children's education, and education for the deaf and mute.

Liu Xiuru, the director of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Education Bureau, reported in detail on the concrete implementation of cultural and educational policies in the liberated areas in the past, proving the correctness of the national, scientific, and mass cultural and educational principles, and the importance of the educational method of linking theory with practice. He also pointed out that after the educational principles and content are determined, the cultivation and transformation of teachers—the specific implementers of the principles—is a major issue. Lan Gongwu, the vice chairman of the North China People's Government, proposed that the promotion of mass education must be closely linked to the lives of the masses and must adopt forms that the masses like to see and hear. Cheng Jinwu, who has been engaged in education in the liberated areas for many years, explained that new democratic education has grown out of struggle, and the establishment of educational principles teaches us how to struggle and in which directions to struggle: To carry out national education is to educate the Chinese people on how to be masters of their own country under the spirit of internationalist patriotism and to oppose colonial-style education; to carry out scientific education is to cultivate materialistic and dialectical viewpoints and methods and to oppose idealistic, feudal, superstitious, and blindly obedient education; to carry out mass education is to cultivate students' outlook on life of serving the people and to oppose the ruling class's education of not working and eating, exploiting, and oppressing others; when carrying out the educational method of combining theory with practice, we must oppose dogmatism and combine it with past practical experience or experiences, and link it with future practical work. Chen Heqin, an expert in early childhood education, pointed out that the content and methods of children's education urgently need to be improved. Li Fusheng, a secondary education worker, raised the issue of the disconnection between university and middle school teaching and the excessive burden of middle school students' homework. Yu Qingtang, a mass education expert, proposed that intellectuals should shoulder the responsibility of eliminating illiteracy. Jiang Xiangyu, an old educator, raised the issue of farmer education. Zhou Gucheng, a professor at Fudan University, believes that the basic issue of rationally developing university education lies in developing productivity and shifting the general public's incorrect views on specialized education. Finally, Du Wenchang, a worker in deaf and mute education, and Lu Zhiwei, the director of the Yenching University School Affairs Committee, both believe that deaf and mute education and private school education will certainly be cultivated and cared for by the People's Government in the new democratic society.

　　人民政协教育界代表
    座谈共同纲领文教政策
    柳＠报告老区文化教育情形
    【本报讯】中国教育工作者代表会议筹委会十月七日招待人民政协教育界代表座谈共同纲领中的文化教育方针。筹委会主任董必武致词后，黄炎培说明了共同纲领中文化教育一节的拟定经过和内容。接着到会人士纷纷发言，从高等教育、中等教育、民众教育、儿童教育、聋哑教育等各方面来解释文教政策。
    北京市人民政府教育局长柳ｓｈí＠①详细报告了解放区过去具体实施文教政策的情形，证明了民族的，科学的，大众的文教方针的正确，和理论联系实际的教育方法的重要；他并提出教育方针和内容确定以后，方针的具体执行者——教员的培养和改造是一个重大问题。华北人民政府副主席蓝公武提出推行大众的教育，其内容必须和大众的生活密切联系，并须采取大众所喜见乐闻的形式。在解放区从事教育工作多年的程今吾说明新民主主义的教育是从斗争中成长起来的，教育方针的确立是在教我们怎样斗争和向哪些方面进行斗争：要进行民族的教育就是要在国际主义的爱国主义的精神下，教育中国人民如何做自己国家的主人，反对殖民式的教育；要进行科学的教育，培养唯物的辩证的观点和方法，反对唯心的，封建的，迷信的，盲从的教育；要进行大众的教育，培养学生为人民服务的人生观，反对统治阶级不劳而食，剥削和压迫他人的教育；在进行理论与实际结合的教育方法时要反对教条主义，要与过去的实际经验或体验结合，要联系将来的实际工作。幼稚教育专家陈鹤琴提出儿童教育的内容及方法都亟需改进。中等教育工作者李复生提出大学与中学教学的脱节，中学生功课太重的问题。民众教育专家俞庆棠提出知识分子要担负扫除文盲的责任。老教育家江向渔提出农民教育的问题。复旦大学教授周谷城认为要合理发展大学教育的基本问题在乎发展生产力和转移社会上一般人对专门教育的不正确看法。最后，聋哑教育工作者杜文昌、燕京大学校务委员会主任陆志韦都认为聋哑教育与私立学校教育在新民主主义社会，一定都能得到人民政府的培养和照顾。（金凤）
