Xinhua News Agency, Budapest Dispatch: The Hungarian working people are widely participating in formulating a five-year plan for the development of the Hungarian national economy, which will begin implementation on January 1, 1950. The most outstanding scientists in the country are actively participating in drafting this plan. Major enterprises have also begun discussing the draft of the five-year plan.

The living standards of the Hungarian working people have significantly improved. In the past year, the price of fats has been reduced by 29%, pork by 28%, sugar by 18%, white bread by 39%, and rice by 30%. The quantity of consumer goods purchased by the working people has also increased significantly: textiles increased by 15% in 1949 compared to last year, leather by 16%, and confectionery by 52%. Since last year, the real wages of the working people have increased by an average of 20%, mainly due to the reduction in prices. The reduction in food prices alone saves the working people 324 million forints (Hungarian currency) annually. Currently, the real wages of the Hungarian people are at least 30% higher than before the war.

　　匈开始制订五年计划
  　人民生活水准显著提高
    【新华社北京二十二日电】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利劳动人民正广泛参与制订发展匈牙利国民经济的五年计划，该计划将于一九五零年一月一日开始实施。全国最杰出的科学家都积极地参加草拟这一计划。各主要企业也开始讨论五年计划的草案。
    匈牙利劳动人民的生活水准已有显著的提高。一年来，脂肪价格已减低百分之二十九，猪肉减低百分之二十八，糖百分之十八，白面包百分之三十九，米百分之三十。劳动人民购买的消费品的数量亦有显著增加：纺织品一九四九年较去年增加百分之十五，皮革百分之十六，糖果百分之五十二。从去年起，劳动人民的实际工资平均增加了百分之二十，这主要是由于物价的减低。仅食品一项价格的减低，便使劳动人民每年节省三亿二千四百万佛罗林（匈币）。现，在匈牙利人民的实际工资，至少已超过战前百分之三十。
