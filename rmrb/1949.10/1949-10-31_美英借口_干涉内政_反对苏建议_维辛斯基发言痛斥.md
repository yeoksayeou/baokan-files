Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, then delivered a lengthy speech. He pointed out that certain delegations, in seeking to evade the Soviet proposal to halt the continuous death sentences passed by Greek military tribunals, were attempting to conceal themselves behind the illusory arguments of "democracy" and "human rights," etc. Vyshinsky reminded the committee of the statement by the representative of the Athens government, which stated in essence that stopping the execution of guerrillas "would be of little use." Vyshinsky said: If this does not indicate that the Athens government does not consider it necessary to stop passing death sentences and does not consider it necessary to stop carrying out executions, then what does this statement mean? In other words, this is a completely frank, and, indeed, shameless admission that the Athens government has sentenced Greek patriots to be shot and has executed them, and that in the future it will continue to pass death sentences and will carry them out. Vyshinsky called on the French representative, who has repeatedly declared that "orthodox democracy" is practiced in Greece, and on the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France, who have insisted that the issue of death sentences passed after September 29 no longer exists in Greece, to pay attention to this statement. Vyshinsky further pointed out that those who voted against the Soviet proposal were, in fact, voting in favor of continuing executions in Greece. Vyshinsky refuted the argument that evades resolving important issues, namely that an appeal by the UN General Assembly to stop the execution of Greek patriots would supposedly constitute "interference in Greek internal affairs." Vyshinsky pointed out that some matters are formally a matter of internal affairs, but in essence, they are by no means internal affairs, or in any case do not have such a nature of internal affairs. It is a matter extremely close to foreign political relations and international relations, just like the issue of the Franco regime, which was condemned by the UN General Assembly. Vyshinsky exposed the hypocrisy of the representatives of the U.S. and British blocs. When interference is unfavorable to them, they vigorously promote adherence to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, while when interference is in their interests, they are very willing to interfere in the real internal affairs of other countries, as in the discussion of the so-called "violations of human rights" in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania.
    The Polish representative then rose and declared that the Polish delegation supported the Soviet proposal. He urged the committee not to limit itself to mere appeals and not to believe the empty assurances of the Greek representative that Greece had stopped executions, because many such assurances, as facts have shown, were merely intended to deceive public opinion.
    The representative of Ecuador proposed that the committee not take a direct decision requiring the cessation of executions, but instead suggest that the Greek Question Conciliation Committee appeal to the Greek government on the matter of executions. The representative of Colombia proposed that the committee express the hope that all countries would cease to pronounce death sentences on all political prisoners.
    At the afternoon meeting on October 26, the Byelorussian representative declared his support for the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation.

　　美英借口“干涉内政”反对苏建议　
    维辛斯基发言痛斥
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基接着发表长篇演讲。他指出，某些代表团因力求规避苏联关于停止希腊军事法庭不断地通过的死刑判决的提案，是企图在“民主”与“人权”等等虚妄的论据下来隐蔽自己。维辛斯基提醒委员会注意雅典政府代表的声明，该声明的大意说：停止处决游击队“很少会有什么用处”。维辛斯基说：假如这不是表明雅典政府并不认为必需停止通过死刑判决并必需停止执行死刑的话，这声明又有什么意思呢？换句话来说，这是完全坦率地，而且，是无耻地招认说：雅典政府宣判了枪毙希腊爱国者，并且处决了他们，而今后它这将继续通过死刑的判决，并将执行。维辛斯基要那一再宣称希腊实行着“正统的民主”的法国代表，要那些硬说九月二十九日以后判处死刑问题在希腊已不存在的美英法等国代表注意这个声明。维辛斯基进而指出：那些投票反对苏联提案的，事实上是投票赞成继续在希腊境内执行死刑。维辛斯基驳斥那种逃避解决重要问题的说法，即把联大之呼吁停止处死希腊爱国者据说是将构成“对希腊内政的干涉”。维辛斯基指出：有些事情形式上属于内政，实质上却绝非内政，或者无论如何没有那样的内政性质。它是与受到联大的谴责的佛朗哥政权问题一样，极其接近对外政治关系与国际关系的事情。维辛斯基揭发了美英集团代表们的伪善性。当干涉对他们不利时，他们便力促遵守不干涉各国内政的原则，而当干涉符合于他们的利益时，他们又非常愿意干涉别国真正的内政了，如象在讨论保、匈、罗三国所谓“违反人权”的问题时那样。
    波兰代表继起声称波兰代表团支持苏联的提案。他促请委员会不要把自己局限于只是呼吁，并且不要相信希腊代表说什么希腊已停止执刑的空洞保证，因为许多这种保证，如事实所显示，只是为了欺骗舆论而已。
    厄瓜多尔的代表提议：委员会不必采取要求停止处决死刑的直接决定，而主张由希腊问题调处委员会向希腊政府就执刑一事提出呼吁。哥伦比亚代表提议，委员会应表示希望一切国家停止对一切政治犯宣判死刑。
    在十月二十六日下午的会议上，白俄罗斯代表宣称赞成苏联代表团所提出的提案。
