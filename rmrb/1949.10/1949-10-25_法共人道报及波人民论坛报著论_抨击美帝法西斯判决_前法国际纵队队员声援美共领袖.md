Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: TASS, Paris, 22nd: The French Communist Party's "L'Humanité" published a commentary on the brutal and despotic sentencing of eleven leaders of the American Communist Party by reactionary forces in the United States, emphasizing that the American Communist Party leaders were found "guilty" because they defended the interests of the working class in their country and the cause of peace throughout the world. The newspaper wrote: The much-touted American "democracy" has revealed its fascist characteristics due to this verdict. "L'Humanité" stressed that the reactionary bosses in the United States today are following in Hitler's footsteps and imitating the Nazis. The American multi-millionaires sentenced the Communist Party leaders to imprisonment, and they have committed crimes against the whole world. They have sent out a signal to carry out persecution in the countries they control. In France, the "trials" of countless Communist Party members, Communist Party leaders, and trade union leaders have already begun, which proves that the ruling class in France, encouraged by the American example, is attempting to strike at the French Communist Party and other working-class organizations. But this policy of persecution is not a sign of strength. On the contrary, it confirms how weak the imperialists appear before the constantly consolidating camp of peace and freedom.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: According to the Polish News Agency, Warsaw, 18th: "People's Tribune" published an article entitled "A Fascist Verdict," condemning the shameless verdict of the US reactionary forces against the US Communist Party leaders, saying: This is one of the biggest crimes in the history of American "justice." The trial of the eleven Communist leaders is not only an act of class revenge but also a large-scale political provocation. The role of this conspiracy is the same as the role of the Reichstag fire in the evil Nazi plan. But the voices of defense of the eleven American Communist Party leaders resounded throughout the court, across borders and continents.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: Agence Telegraphique Parisienne, 19th: The National Office of the Former French Volunteers to Republican Spain Association, representing the former International Brigade members from France, sent a telegram to Gates (one of the eleven US Communist Party leaders found "guilty" by a New York Federal Court jury), expressing support and protesting the shameful verdict of the US reactionary court against Gates and his American Communist Party comrades. The telegram also stated: "They are stepping up their struggle to help the American Communist Party leaders and ensure that former members of the Fifteenth Brigade (note: Comrade Gates once served as the political commissar of the brigade) take action to fight for the freedom of Gates and his comrades." The telegram was signed by French Communist Party leader and member of the French National Assembly, Marty, former commander of the Fourteenth Brigade, Sagnier, and Breton.

  　抨击美帝法西斯判决
    前法国际纵队队员声援美共领袖
    【新华社北京二十四日电】塔斯社巴黎二十二日讯：法共人道报对美国反动势力残暴专横地判决美国共产党十一位领袖，发表评论，强调指出：美国共产党领袖之所以被判“罪”，是因为他们保卫他们国家工人阶级的利益及全世界的和平事业。该报写道：大吹大擂的美国“民主”，由于这次判决而显露了法西斯主义的特质。人道报着重称：美国今日的反动头子们步希特勒的后尘，模仿纳粹。美国的巨万富翁判处共产党领袖徒刑，他们对全世界犯了罪。他们发出了在他们所控制的国家中进行迫害的信号。在法国，对无数共产党议员、共产党领袖及工会领袖的“审讯”已经开始，这证明法国的统治阶级为美国的榜样所鼓励，企图打击法国共产党及其他工人阶级的组织。但这个迫害政策并不是强大的征象。相反地，它证实了帝国主义分子在不断地巩固的和平与自由阵营之前，显得如何脆弱。
    【新华社北京二十四日电】据波兰通讯社华沙十八日讯：人民论坛报发表以“一个法西斯的判决”为题的论文，抨击美国反动势力对美共领袖的无耻判决称：这是美国“司法”史中最大的罪行之一，十一位共产党领袖的受审，不仅是阶级复仇的行为，而且是一种大规模的政治挑衅。这种阴谋计划的作用，正如德国国会纵火案在罪恶的纳粹计划中所起的作用一样。但十一位美国共产党领袖的抗辩的声音响彻法庭，越过国境与大陆。
    【新华社北京二十四日电】电通社巴黎十九日讯：由前法国赴共和西班牙志愿军协会全国办事处代表法国前国际纵队队员致电盖兹（被纽约联邦法院陪审团裁决判“罪”的十一位美共领袖之一），表示支援，并抗议美国反动法庭对盖兹和他的美国共产党同志的可耻判决。该电并称：“他们正加紧斗争，以帮助美国共产党领袖，并保证前第十五纵队队员（按盖兹同志曾任该纵队政治委员）以行动争取盖兹和他的同志的自由。”该电由法共领袖、法国国民议会议员马尔梯，前第十四纵队司令员萨尼埃和布莱东签字。
