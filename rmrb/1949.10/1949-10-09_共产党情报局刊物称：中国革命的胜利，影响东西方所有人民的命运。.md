World Progressive Press Congratulates the Birth of New China

　　Communist Information Bureau Publication Claims:
　　The Victory of the Chinese Revolution Impacts the Destiny of All People in the East and West.
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th】Telecommunications Agency Bucharest dispatch: The Communist Information Bureau publication "For a Lasting Peace, For a People's Democracy," published on the 7th, featured a large portrait of Mao Zedong on its front page and released an editorial, pointing out that the victory of the Chinese revolution has world-historic significance, not only impacting the destiny of the Chinese people, but also impacting the destiny of all people in the East and West. The editorial declared: The Chinese revolution dealt a fatal blow to the combined forces of domestic reactionaries and foreign imperialism in China, and dealt a new and powerful blow to the entire system of world imperialism. This is the most serious defeat suffered by the entire system of world imperialism since the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union and the defeat of Hitlerite fascism. The editorial pointed out: This is a milestone in human history, it destroyed the strength of world imperialism to such an extent, that it provided the decisive precondition for the victory of the Chinese democratic revolution. The editorial issued a warning to guard against the activities of American imperialists attempting to sabotage the Chinese national liberation movement by infiltrating spies and provocateurs. The editorial, in quoting Lenin's statement that the outcome of the struggle of oppressed humanity will be determined by Russia, India, and China, which possess the vast majority of the world's population, stated: The victory of the Chinese revolution will undoubtedly inspire the people of colonies and dependent countries. "The People's Republic of China will be their loyal friend and reliable fortress." This victory also "further weakened the imperialist front, intensified the general crisis of the capitalist system, and brought the inevitable end of bourgeois rule ever closer, accelerating the final victory of the world's working people and the advent of communism."

　　共产党情报局刊物称：
    中国革命的胜利，影响东西方所有人民的命运。
    【新华社北京八日电】电通社布加勒斯特讯：七日出版的共产党情报局刊物“争取人民民主，争取持久和平”在首页刊登毛泽东的巨像，并发表社论，指出中国革命的胜利，具有世界性的历史意义，不仅影响中国人民的命运，而且影响东西方所有人民的命运。社论声称：中国革命予国内反动派和在华的外国帝国主义的联合力量以致命的打击，并予世界帝国主义整个制度以新的强有力的打击，这是在伟大的十月社会主义革命在苏联的胜利和击败希特勒法西斯主义以来，世界帝国主义整个制度所遭受的最为严重的失败。社论指出：这是人类历史上的一个里程牌，它摧毁了世界帝国主义的力量到这样一个程度，以致提供了中国民主革命胜利的决定性前提。社论发出，警告要防备美帝国主义者企图以间谍及挑拨者潜入的活动而从中破坏中国民族解放运动。社论在援引列宁所称被压迫的人类的斗争结局将由俄国、印度、中国拥有世界人口的绝大部分的事实所决定一语时称：中国革命的胜利，无疑将鼓舞殖民地及附属国的人民。“中华人民共和国将是它们的忠实友人和可靠堡垒。”这个胜利并“进一步削弱了帝国主义阵线，加剧了资本主义制度的普遍危机，使资产阶级统治的无可避免的末日益形逼近。加速了世界劳动人民最后胜利和共产主义胜利的来临”。
