Comprehensive TASS News: The All-Union Machine and Tractor Stations in the Soviet Union have completed the grain harvesting plan. This year, the area of land harvested by tractors and agricultural machinery has increased by seven million hectares compared to last year. This proves that the mechanization of agriculture in the Soviet Union has made significant progress again.
The number of combine harvesters obtained by machine and tractor stations this year is more than double that of last year, and the efficiency has also been greatly improved. The daily working efficiency of each self-propelled combine harvester is equivalent to the labor of more than one hundred people. The rate of harvesting sugar beets has increased three times compared to last year. Two of the most outstanding combine harvester drivers have created brilliant records in wheat harvesting. Konstantin Brin harvested a total of 1,467 hectares (equivalent to more than 23,000 Chinese mu) in twenty-seven days, yielding 23,500 centners of wheat (equivalent to 2.35 million jin). Alexander Osokin harvested almost the same area in the same number of days, yielding 25,000 centners (equivalent to 2.5 million jin) of wheat.
The machine and tractor stations throughout the Soviet Union have a large number of various types of tractors, from three-horsepower tractors for gardens and vegetable gardens to eighty-horsepower tracked tractors, which can work on the most uneven land. Electric tractors have also begun to be used and will be widely used in the future with the continuous increase of electrified collective farms. In addition, agricultural machinery factories have produced the first batch of versatile tractors specifically for nurseries, orchards, gardens, tea and tobacco plantations, etc., which can tow plows, seeders, climb hills, and pass through depressions and gullies. This machine consumes low fuel and can cultivate four hectares per day.
Various newly designed agricultural machines are also changing with each passing day. An electromagnetic machine is being produced in Gomel Oblast, Russia, which can automatically separate the seeds of clover, alfalfa, flax, and millet. The cotton picking machine manufactured in Tashkent will be used for the first time in large quantities in the cotton fields of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan this year. The newly designed rice harvester, which can arrange the rice in rows while harvesting, also surpasses other rice harvesters in efficiency. Collective farms in Georgia used a newly created tung oil refining machine this year, refining thousands of tons of tung oil, saving a lot of labor.

  　完成谷物收割计划
    今年机器收割面积增七百万公顷
　  万能拖拉机电磁机器正广泛运用
    【新华社北京十五日电】综合塔斯社讯：苏联全国的机器与拖拉机站已完成谷物收割计划。今年用拖拉机和农业机器收割的土地面积，比去年增加七百万公顷。这证明苏联的农业机械化又有了显著的进展。
    机器与拖拉机站今年所得到的联合机的数量上比去年多一倍，效能也大大提高了。每架自动推进联合机每天的工作效率，等于一百多人的劳动。收割甜菜的速率比去年增加了三倍。两个最优秀的联合机驾驶员在收割小麦的工作中创造出辉煌的纪录。康斯坦丁·布林一个人在二十七天中共收割了一千四百六十七公顷（合中国两万三千多市亩）的面积，打下的小麦计二万三千五百生丁纳（合二百三十五万市斤）。亚历山大·奥斯金则在同样的天数中，收割了差不多同等的面积，打了二万五千生丁纳（合二百五十万市斤）的小麦。
    全苏各地的机器与拖拉机站，拥有大量各式各样的拖拉机，从用于花园和菜园的三匹马力的拖拉机到八十匹马力的环带拖拉机，这种环带拖拉机可以在最不平的土地上工作。电动拖拉机也已开始应用了，今后将随电气化集体农场的不断增加而广泛使用。此外，农业机器制造厂已出产了第一批专用于苗圃、果园、花园、茶和烟草种植园等的万能拖拉机，它能曳引着犁，条播机攀登山坡，通过凹地和沟壑。这种机器燃料消耗量低，每天可耕种四公顷。
    各种新设计的农业机器，也是日新月异。自俄罗斯的哥美尔州正在出产一种电磁机器，它能将三叶草、苜蓿、亚麻和黍子的种子自动分开。在塔什干制造的采棉机，今年将第一次被大量应用于乌兹别克斯坦、塔什克斯坦和土克曼斯坦的棉田。新设计的稻米收获机，它能与收割同时将稻排列成行，在效率上也超过其他稻米收获机。乔治亚集体农场今年使用了一种新创造的桐油提炼机，提炼了数以千吨计的桐油，节省了大量劳动力。
