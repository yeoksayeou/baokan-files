　　Strive to Learn from the Soviet Army Building Experience
    The Second and Third Field Armies and the East China Military Region Express Enthusiastically
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 7th dispatch] The news of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the great socialist Soviet Union and various new democratic countries and us has come one after another, which has inspired the Second Field Army's directly subordinate units and all commanders and fighters to have a high degree of enthusiasm for learning from the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries. Tian Qing, political instructor of the guard battalion, believes that the Soviet Union's first recognition of our country is the greatest expression of friendship to the Chinese people. We thank the Soviet Union and want to learn from the Soviet Red Army. The students who participated in the southward military work from the North China Revolutionary University were also extremely happy when they heard the news. Li Xinzhu was deceived by the Kuomintang propaganda when he studied in the Northeast in the past, but later he saw the practical help of the Soviet Union in the industrial construction of Dalian, and realized the great contribution of the Soviet Union's defeat of Japan to the liberation of the Northeast, and his attitude changed. He said: "Now the Soviet Union is the first to establish diplomatic relations with us, which proves even more that the Soviet Union is indeed our loyal friend." Wu Hengliang of the Second Field Army Political Department Printing Plant said: "This news is an encouragement to us and a heavy blow to imperialism. It will make the remaining Kuomintang bandits in Guangdong collapse even faster. In order to thank the Soviet friends for their great friendship, we should learn from the advanced Soviet worker brothers." The General Learning Committee of the Political Department of the Second Field Army summarized the theoretical study of cadres for a month and emphasized that in the future, the three major documents of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference should be the main focus, focusing on studying the views of consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and uniting international friends, especially to further recognize the truth that Chairman Mao put forward that in the international arena, we must stand on the side of the international peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 7th dispatch] Commanders and fighters of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army warmly welcome the Soviet Union's first recognition of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and unanimously proposed to learn from the great Soviet Red Army and Red Navy. Zhou Junming, Deputy Chief of Staff of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army, said: "The great Soviet Union has consistently assisted our liberation struggle, and now it is the first to recognize the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, which shows that the Soviet Union's assistance to the Chinese people is unwavering. In the future, the close unity of the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union, which account for one-third of the world's population, will greatly strengthen the strength of the world's democratic peace camp headed by the Soviet Union. Any imperialism that dares to launch a war of aggression will be smashed to pieces in front of it." He also said: "The advanced Soviet Red Army showed unparalleled power in the anti-fascist war and became a strong force to defend world peace. We must learn from the Soviet Red Army's experience in army building and build ourselves into a strong national defense force." Li Musheng, commander of a certain division of the People's Liberation Army garrisoning Nanjing, said: "Our government is proud to be recognized by the Soviet Union first. We have gained the support and assistance of democratic and peace-loving countries all over the world headed by the Soviet Union. We firmly believe that the construction of New China will be completed soon! We are determined to fight to the end to defend the motherland, defend the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and defend world peace!" Peng Yuguang, a soldier of a certain regiment, said: "The Soviet Union is our elder brother, and his first recognition of our government is the first expression of being of one heart with us. Our strength is even stronger, and we are no longer afraid of imperialists invading us." The People's Navy was excited and encouraged when they heard the news. Guo Cheng森, deputy captain of a squadron of the Naval Academy, who had served as the deputy captain of the former Changzhi ship, said: "The Soviet Union's first recognition of New China shows that the Soviet Union is the most reliable friend of our New China. Our People's Navy must learn from the example of the Soviet Red Navy and strive to build a strong Chinese People's Navy." The entire East China Military and Political University was shaken by this good news. The students of the 12th Regiment of the school were in class. After hearing the good news, the entire venue applauded enthusiastically for six minutes, and excitedly shouted: "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live the Soviet Union!" "Long live the close unity between China and the Soviet Union!"

　　努力学习苏联建军经验
    二三野战军暨华东军区热烈表示
    【新华社南京七日电】伟大的社会主义苏联和各新民主主义国家与我建立外交关系的消息接踵而至，激发了第二野战军直属队全体指战员向苏联及新民主主义国家学习的高度热情。警卫营政治指导员田青认为：苏联首先承认我国，是对中国人民最大友谊的表示。我们感谢苏联，要向苏联红军学习。华北革命大学南下参军工作的学生们闻讯也极为高兴。李新珠过去在东北念书时，受了国民党的欺骗宣传，但后来看到苏联对大连工业建设的实际帮助，认识到苏联击败日本对解放东北的伟大贡献，自己态度才改变了。他说：“现在苏联首先与我建立外交关系，更证明了苏联真是我们忠诚的朋友。”第二野战军政治部印刷厂武亨亮说：“这消息对我们是一个鼓舞，对帝国主义是个沉重的打击，将使广东的残余国民党匪帮垮得更快些。我们为了感谢苏联朋友的伟大友谊，应向先进的苏联工人兄弟学习。”二野政治部总学委会总结一个月干部的理论学习后，强调提出今后应以人民政协三大文献为主，着重学习巩固人民民主专政和团结国际友人的观点，特别是要更进一步认识毛主席提出的在国际上必须站在以苏联为首的国际和平民主阵营一边的真理。
    【新华社南京七日电】人民解放军华东军区及第三野战军指战员对苏联首先承认我中华人民共和国中央人民政府表示热烈欢迎，并一致提出向伟大的苏联红军、红海军学习。华东军区及第三野战军副参谋长周骏鸣说：“伟大的苏联一贯援助我们的解放斗争，现在又首先承认了我们中华人民共和国中央人民政府，这说明了苏联对中国人民的援助是始终不渝的。今后占全世界人口三分之一的中苏两大民族的亲密团结，将大大加强了以苏联为首的世界民主和平阵营的力量。任何敢于发动侵略战争的帝国主义将在它的面前碰得头破血流。”他又说：“先进的苏联红军在反法西斯战争中显示了无比的威力，成为保卫世界和平的坚强力量，我们要学习无敌的苏联红军的建军经验，把自己建设成为一支强大的国防军。”警备南京的解放军某师师长李木生说：“我们的政府以能得苏联的首先承认而感到骄傲。我们获得了全世界以苏联为首的民主和平国家的支持和援助。我们坚信新中国的建设将会很快地完成！我们决为保卫祖国、保卫中苏两国友谊、保卫世界和平而奋斗到底！”某团战士彭玉光说：“苏联是我们的老大哥，他首先承认我们的政府，是首先表示和我们一条心。我们的力量更强大了，再也不怕帝国主义者侵略我们了。”人民海军闻讯后无不兴奋鼓舞，海军学校某中队副队长，曾任前长治舰副舰长的郭成森说：“苏联首先承认新中国，说明苏联是我们新中国最可靠的朋友，我们人民海军要学习苏联红海军的榜样，为建设强大的中国人民海军而努力。”华东军政大学全校都为这个喜讯所震动。该校十二团学员正在上课，听到喜讯后，全场狂热鼓掌历六分钟之久，并兴奋地高呼：“中华人民共和国万岁！”“苏联万岁！”“中苏紧密团结万岁！”
