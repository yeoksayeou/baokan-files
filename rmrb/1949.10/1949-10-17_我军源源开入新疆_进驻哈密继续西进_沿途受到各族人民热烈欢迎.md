Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 16th: The People's Liberation Army began its march into Xinjiang on the 12th of this month, entering Xingxingxia, a strategically important military location within Xinjiang, on the same day, and entering the famous city of Hami at 5 p.m. on the 13th. Currently, the PLA's main force is continuously entering Xinjiang and continuing its westward advance. The PLA troops entering Xinjiang are well-equipped and have smart military bearing. Every officer and soldier is wearing and equipped with brand-new overcoats, leather jackets, leather gloves, felt boots, goggles, and masks. The entire army has high morale and is full of vigor. Before departure, many people made advancement plans, expressing their determination to complete this glorious historical task. The artillery battalion of a certain army had livestock that could not be transported by vehicles, and more than 200 soldiers volunteered to walk and lead the livestock forward. One hundred and twenty drivers from the former Kuomintang Joint Logistics Automobile Regiment's Fifth Regiment overcame difficulties and completed the advance preparation two days ahead of schedule, transporting the PLA forward. The soldiers sang heroic songs in the vehicles, advancing mightily towards Xinjiang. After the People's Liberation Army entered Xinjiang along the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway, it was enthusiastically welcomed by the vast number of Xinjiang people along the way. When the People's Liberation Army arrived ten kilometers from Hami City, Uyghur people lined the streets to welcome them, holding Hami melons to give to the PLA soldiers, expressing their love and consolation to the People's Liberation Army. Representatives from all walks of life in Dihua City traveled a long distance to line up to welcome the PLA delegation eight kilometers outside Hami City. Amidst thunderous applause and shouts of joy in both Uyghur and Han languages, the People's Liberation Army slowly entered Hami City through the long welcoming lines on both sides of the avenue. Hami City was plastered with large banners welcoming the People's Liberation Army, and the streets were filled with people from all ethnic groups who enthusiastically shouted to the People's Liberation Army in their respective languages: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" Many people rushed to the PLA soldiers to shake hands and embrace them warmly. Hami City was instantly immersed in unprecedented jubilation. The former Kuomintang troops and local Kuomintang organizations stationed in Xingxingxia and Hami after announcing their departure from the Kuomintang's remnant puppet government in late last month are ready and will be taken over and reorganized by the People's Liberation Army.

　　我军源源开入新疆
  　进驻哈密继续西进
  　沿途受到各族人民热烈欢迎
    【新华社西北前线十六日电】人民解放军于本月十二日开始向新疆进军，当日进驻新疆境内军事要地星星峡，并于十三日下午五时进驻著名的哈密城。现解放军大军正源源开入新疆，并继续向西进军中。解放军入疆部队装备优良，军容整齐，每个指战员都穿着和装备着崭新的大衣、皮衣、皮手套、毡靴、风镜和口罩，全军士气高昂，精神奋发。出发前许多人都订了进军计划，表示要坚决完成这一光荣的历史任务。某军炮兵营的牲口，不能上汽车，全营即有二百多名战士报名，愿徒步牵牲口前进。原国民党联勤辎重汽车团第五团一百二十名司机，克服困难，提前两天完成进军准备，载运解放军前进。战士们在汽车上唱出雄壮的歌声，浩浩荡荡向新疆进发。人民解放军沿甘新公路进入新疆后，沿途受到了广大新疆人民的热烈欢迎。当人民解放军进到距哈密城十公里时，即有维吾尔族人民夹道欢迎，他们拿着哈密甜瓜送给解放军的战士们，表示对人民解放军的热爱和慰劳。迪化市各界人民欢迎解放军代表团则远道赶至哈密城外八公里处列队欢迎。解放军在雷鸣似的掌声和维、汉语言交汇的欢呼声中，通过大道两旁的漫长的欢迎行列，缓缓进入哈密城。哈密城内满贴着欢迎人民解放军的大幅标语，街头万人空巷，各民族人民用他们各自的语言向人民解放军狂热地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“人民解放军万岁！”“中华人民共和国万岁！”许多人都奔向解放军战士们热烈地握手和拥抱。哈密城顿时沉浸在前所未有的欢腾中。于上月下旬宣布脱离国民党残余伪府后留驻于星星峡及哈密等地的前国民党军队和国民党地方机关，均已准备就绪，即将由解放军接收和改编。
