　　The Happiest Day of My Life
　　Beijing Garment Factory, Heita Temple Cotton Mill Zhou Zhongling
　　On September 27, 1949, I participated in the Beijing-Tianjin delegation to present flags and flowers to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all the representatives at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. I will never forget this happiest day of my life.
　　At a quarter past four in the afternoon, when we entered the venue, all six hundred representatives in the hall were clapping with smiles on their faces, watching us present the big red flag to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. At this moment, I felt extremely nervous.
　　Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu took the big red flag and flowers, and then shook the little hands of each of the young students very warmly. At this moment, I strained my eyes and looked towards the rostrum. Ah! I saw them, I saw our leader full of energy, with a kind smile, looking at us. Commander-in-Chief Zhu was also smiling happily, and kindly touching the heads of the young students. I was so happy, I never dreamed that I could see our leader. This really excited me too much! If it weren't for being in the meeting place, I would have jumped up with joy!
　　Next, a student from Tsinghua University, representing us, read the dedication to the conference. When he read "We, the younger generation – the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, are loyal! brave! diligent! firm! We will use our hands to build our factories, farms, national defense, schools – we will follow Mao Zedong! towards eternal victory!" Ah, these words touched me, and I couldn't help but shed tears. Yes, we must use unparalleled enthusiasm, we must use our hands to create a bright and splendid new China! Forever follow Mao Zedong! Towards eternal victory!

　　一生最快乐的日子
    北京被服厂、黑塔寺铺棉厂  周仲玲
    一九四九年九月二十七日，我参加了京津代表团在中国人民政治协商会上向毛主席朱总司令和全体代表献旗献花。我永远也不能忘记这一生最快乐的日子。
    下午四点一刻，我们进入会场时，全场的六百多位代表都笑得闭不上嘴地鼓着掌，看着我们献给毛主席朱总司令的大红旗。这时我感到浑身非常紧张。
    毛主席朱总司令接过了这面大红旗和鲜花，便很亲热地握着每个小同学的小手。这时我用劲睁大了眼，向主席台上看。啊！看见了，我看见了我们的领袖精神饱满，带着和蔼的微笑，望着我们。朱总司令也在欢快地笑着，很亲切地摸着小同学的头。我真高兴，做梦也没想到我能看见了我们的领袖。这真太使我兴奋了！要不是在会场上，我快乐得真要跳起来！
    接着，一位清华大学的同学代表我们向大会念献词。当他念到“我们青年的一代——中华民族的儿女，忠诚！勇敢！勤劳！坚定！要用我们的双手建设我们的工厂、农庄、国防、学校、——我们跟着毛泽东走！走向永远的胜利！”啊，这些字句感动着我，使我不能自禁地流下了热泪。是的，我们要用无比的热诚，要用我们的双手来创造光辉灿烂的新中国！永远地跟着毛泽东走！走向永远的胜利！
