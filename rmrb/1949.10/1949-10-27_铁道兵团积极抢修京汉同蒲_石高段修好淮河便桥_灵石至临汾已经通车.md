　　Railway Corps Actively Repairs the Jinghan and Tongpu Railways
　　Shigaoduan Repairs the Huaihe Pontoon Bridge
　　Lingshi to Linfen is Open to Traffic
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Fourth Detachment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Railway Corps is undertaking the task of repairing the Shi (Jiazhuang) An (Yang) section of the Jinghan Railway. Work commenced on September 25th, prioritizing the repair of the Shijiazhuang to Gaoyi section. Within this section, the 24th Line Brigade is responsible for bridge repair. As of October 10th, the Third Company and infantry company of a certain unit on this line had repaired the 318-kilometer Huaihe pontoon bridge, which is 226 meters long and was completely destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops. During this project, everyone demonstrated great enthusiasm for labor. In particular, all comrades of the Seventh Company were greatly encouraged by the founding of the People's Republic of China and the election of Chairman Mao as the head of the government, and they worked even harder. They were assigned the task of moving 110 cubic meters of earth (over a distance of 30 meters with approximately 80 people) that day, with a target to complete it in one day, but they finished it in just two hours, and then continued to move another 110 cubic meters.

　　Throughout the entire bridge repair project, all cadres took the lead and set an example. The political instructor of the infantry company carried large stones on the site along with everyone else, shouting slogans to encourage them. Jin Shanglong and Zhang Jiashou, platoon leaders of the First Company, and two other comrades carried a 500-kilogram sledgehammer, earning the respect of the villagers. Jin Defu, the company commander of the Seventh Company, was the first to go up to drive piles and tie scaffolding. The supervisor and soldiers of the infantry company competed to carry earth, and they carried the most.

　　Moreover, democracy was brought into full play in the project. Everyone came up with ideas and suggestions. Before the start of work, meetings were held to discuss possible difficulties in the project and how to overcome them. During work breaks, people also freely combined to study and discuss working methods. For example, when tamping the earthwork for the temporary line on the first day, they initially used a wooden "rammer," which required a team of four people, which was laborious. After discussion, they borrowed stone rollers from the local people to level the road, which saved both effort and manpower. Their high enthusiasm for labor has been commended by the headquarters of the Railway Corps.

　　[Another Dispatch] The railway repair project on the Lingshi to Linfen section was completed on October 9th and opened to traffic on the same day. The project commenced in late June this year, originally scheduled to be completed by the end of September, but due to continuous rain during the construction period, the project was delayed by sixteen days, requiring an extension into October. In order to complete the task on schedule, the South Tongpu Engineering Brigade decided to launch a surprise repair campaign from October 1st to October 10th, striving to arrive in Linfen by October 10th to celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China and the establishment of the Central People's Government. All unit employees enthusiastically responded to this call. When there were only sixteen kilometers left to Linfen (about two stops), with only five days remaining, to ensure arrival on schedule, the minimum speed had to be three kilometers per day. All workers of Line One Brigade worked tirelessly, starting a surprise campaign from the 6th, creating new records. On the first day, they spiked 3 kilometers and 10 meters of track, on the second day, they spiked 4 kilometers, on the third day, they spiked 2 kilometers and 800 meters because the locomotive ran out of water, and on the fourth day, the day before October 10th, they spiked 5 kilometers and 7 meters, successfully arriving in Linfen and creating the highest record.

　　铁道兵团积极抢修京汉同蒲            
    石高段修好淮河便桥　
    灵石至临汾已经通车
    【本报讯】中国人民解放军铁道兵团四支队抢修京汉路石（家庄）安（阳）段工程任务，自上月二十五日先后动工首先抢修石家庄到高邑段。在该段任务中，二十四线路大队担任抢修桥梁工程，截至本月十日止，该线某部三中队及步兵连已修好三一八公里淮河便桥，该桥全长二二六米全被国民党匪军破坏。在此工程中，大家发挥了高度的劳动热情，特别是七连的全体同志们，当时正值中华人民共和国成立，毛主席当选政府主席，他们在这消息的鼓舞下，干的更加起劲，他们那天分到一百一十立方米的挑土任务（三十米距离八十人左右），规定一天完成，结果仅两小时即完成了，后又接着挑了一百一十立方米。
    在整个修桥工程中，全体干部都是率先垂范，以身作则。步兵连政治指导员在现场上和大家一样抬大石头，并且喊着口号鼓动大家，一连排长金尚龙、张甲守和另外两名同志抬着五○○公斤的大铁锤，引起老乡们的敬佩。七连连长金德福在打桩绑架子时，他最先跑到上边去干，步兵连监工员和战士们比着挑土，而且挑的最多。
    不仅如此，在工程中，更发挥了民主，大家想办法，出主意，在开工前就开会讨论了工程中可能发生的困难及如何克服等问题。在工作休息时，也同样自由结合着来研究讨论工作方式方法，如头天修便线土工打夯时，先用木制“夯”，须四人一组，这样费劲，大家研究后，就去借老百姓的石滚子来平道，这样又省力又省人。他们这种高度的劳动热忱，已得到铁道兵团司令部的通令嘉奖。
    【又讯】灵石至临汾段的铁路抢修工程，于十月九日完工，并在同日通车。该段工程从今年六月下旬动工，原计划九月底完工，但由于在施工期中阴雨连绵，耽搁了十六天的工程，这样就须要延长到十月以后。为争取按期完成任务，南同蒲工程大队部特别决定了自十月一日到十月十日展开突击抢修运动，争取十月十日到临汾来庆祝中华人民共和国及中央人民政府的成立。各单位职工都热烈的响应了这个号召。当修到距离临汾还有两站地计长十六公里的时候，时间仅有五天了，要保证按期赶到，每天最低要保证三公里以上的速度才能达到，线一队全体工友们不辞疲劳，从六日起就开始了突击运动，创造新的纪录。第一天钉道三公里十公尺，第二天钉道四公里，第三天因为机车没水了钉了二公里八百米，第四天即十月十日的前一天，钉了五公里七公尺，胜利地抵达临汾，创造了最高纪录。
