[Beijing News] Two private coal mines in Mentougou, Minsheng Hongji and Da Maosheng, neglected labor insurance, did not pay attention to underground engineering, and violated the government's ban on "eating back coal." In September and October, the coal mines collapsed successively, causing 34 workers to be killed or injured in two incidents. After the incident, the Beijing Municipal People's Government attached great importance to it. On the one hand, it placed the persons in charge of the two mines under custody for investigation and punishment according to law; on the other hand, it established a district-wide employee safety committee to strengthen the work of protecting worker safety. The cause of the accident at the Minsheng Hongji mine was that the mine competed with neighboring mines to dig residual coal pillars, causing the top stone to fall suddenly, killing 12 workers including Zhang Juncai, seriously injuring 4 workers including Chen Huisheng, and slightly injuring 9 workers including Dong Zaiguo. After receiving the report, the Beijing West Mining Bureau of the Municipal Government immediately sent personnel to the scene to investigate. The next day, they held a meeting with the District Office, the Public Security Sub-bureau, the District Office of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Mentougou District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the families of the dead and injured, and the mine owners to discuss the aftermath. The mine owners were responsible for dressing the deceased, providing compensation to the families, and treating the injured.

After the incident, in order to ensure the safety of workers in the future, the Beijing West Mining Bureau held a meeting with various units in Mentougou: Menkuang Company, the District Office of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the District Office, the Public Security Sub-bureau, etc., and decided to establish an employee safety committee to regularly handle worker safety and welfare affairs, improve workers' lives, and reduce worker casualties. It also convened a meeting of shareholders of the Minsheng Hongji mine to review the cause of the accident, which confirmed that it was caused by the mine owner's carelessness and the foreman's negligence of duty. Therefore, the manager Yang Zhipu and the foreman Li Ziru were sent to the People's Court for punishment according to law. The accident at the Da Maosheng coal mine was also due to violating the government's decree of "no eating back coal, no removing coal pillars," secretly digging "back coal." In addition, most of the coal ponds were flooded during the rainy season this year. On the 19th of this month, the main ridge in the mine collapsed, killing 5 workers including Han Guangcun and injuring 4 workers including Yue Dashun. The Beijing West Mining Bureau has investigated the truth of the accident, ordered the mine to provide reasonable compensation for the aftermath, and sent the foreman Duan Huaizeng to the Public Security Bureau for custody, and then transferred him to the court for punishment. It also reviewed this unfortunate incident and decided to conduct thorough inspections in the future, and promptly correct private mines that violate laws and regulations and neglect workers' health, to ensure that similar accidents do not occur again in the future.

　　两私营煤窑违犯禁令　
    煤窑塌陷成灾　
    死伤工人三十四名       
    两窑负责人员送法院处办
    【北京讯】门头沟私营民生宏记和大茂盛两煤窑，忽视劳动保险，不注意井下工程，违犯政府发布的“吃回煤”禁令，九、十两月煤窑先后塌陷，两次死伤工人三十四名。事件发生后，京市人民政府极为重视，一面将两窑负责人员看押，依法征处；一面成立全区职工安全委员会，加强保护工人安全的工作。民生宏记窑造成失事的原因，是该窑与邻窑争挖残留煤柱，顶石陡然下落，砸死工人张俊才等十二名，重伤陈惠生等四名，轻伤董在国等九名。市府京西矿务处据报后，即派员赴现场查看，次日又与区公所、公安分局、市总工会区办事处、中共门头沟区委会及死伤家属、窑主开会，商定善后办法，由窑主负责装殓死者，抚恤家属及治疗伤患。
    事后，京西矿务处为保障今后工人安全，与门头沟各单位：门矿公司、市总工会区办事处、区公所、公安分局等开会，决议成立职工安全委员会，经常处理工人安全福利事务，改善工人生活，减免工人伤亡。并曾召集民生宏记窑股东会议，检讨肇事原因，证实系窑主粗心和工程作头疏于职守所致，乃将经理杨志圃、大作头李子如送人民法院依法惩处。大茂盛煤窑失事，亦系违犯政府“不准吃回煤、不准撤煤柱”的法令，私行偷挖“回煤”，加以本年雨季煤塘大半被淹，本月十九日窑内大脊塌陷，砸死工人韩广存等五名，伤岳大顺等四名。京西矿务处已调查失事真相，令饬该窑合理抚恤善后，并将工程作头段怀增送公安局看押，然后转法院惩处。并对此不幸事件作了检讨，决定今后切实深入检查，对违反法令及忽视工人健康的私营矿窑，及时纠正，保证今后不再发生同样事故。
