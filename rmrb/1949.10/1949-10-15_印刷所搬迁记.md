A Record of the Printing House Relocation
Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Worker Huang Zhitong

The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Printing House was originally located in Baozhuang, Yuefen, halfway up a hill with over a hundred steps. Running up and down empty-handed was exhausting, and it was very inconvenient, significantly impacting work. Everyone proposed relocation. After several general meetings and discussions, a consensus was reached. Comrades, in the time they could spare from work, managed to find a building. However, moving from Yue Temple to Songmuchang, such a long distance, how to move? What to use to move? The heavy machinery (including folio, quarto, No. 2, No. 3, double-sided printing presses, lithographic presses, type-casting machines, paper cutters, etc., totaling more than twenty units), on a hillside with over a hundred steps, simply moving it to flat ground was already a strenuous task. Furthermore, the lead type alone was enough to cause headaches. Not only was it heavy, but it also couldn't be mixed up. Especially important was to be able to resume work as soon as possible. The entire force mobilized was only fifty-odd people, and the vast majority had no moving experience. In terms of physical strength, it was clearly insufficient.

According to the lowest estimate, it would take at least half a month or more to resume work. Therefore, another meeting was convened to discuss. Comrade Xu Jieshen said: "Currently, material resources are scarce, we must use manpower to overcome this, and take a responsible attitude as masters of our own affairs to take joint responsibility and help each other." Everyone agreed that this was correct, and were willing to greet the work with excitement, to exceed the planned goals, and complete the task.

On the morning of September 9th, the intense moving work began. In order to resume work quickly, many parts could not be completely disassembled, but this added to the difficulty of moving. Just as it was difficult to solve, several comrades from the general affairs section came, they had made a special trip to help us. The comrades of our printing house redoubled their efforts and competed with them. Comrade Wang Zhengxing was injured during the move, but not only did he not complain, he was only frustrated that he could no longer participate in the work. In this way, the arduous task of that day was finally overcome by us!

On the second day of the moving work, several worker comrades from the city station material factory also rushed over with enthusiasm, further boosting our passion. In an atmosphere of unity, mutual assistance, and friendship, the moving work was completed in just five days. At the same time, in this moving work, everyone's work attitude and work style were also effectively tested. – Most of our working comrades have begun to transform from the old employment mindset under the old system to a new, conscious position as masters of their own affairs.

　　印刷所搬迁记
    浙赣路工人  黄芝庭
    浙赣铁路印刷所原在岳坟的鲍庄，位于百余级高的半山上，空手跑几次也很吃力，来往很不方便，对工作影响相当大，大家就提出迁移的要求。经过几次大会讨论，一致通过之后，各同志在不妨碍工作的时间内好容易找到了房子，可是从岳庙搬到松木场，这么长的路，怎样搬？用什么搬呢？笨重的机器（包括对开、四开、二号、三号、双面动……等的铅印机、石印机、铸字机、切纸机等共二十余架），在百余级高的半山里，仅仅搬到平地上也是件很费力的事；再加铅字一项也够伤脑筋。重还不打紧，且不能弄乱。尤其要能够及早复工。所动员的全部力量也不过五十余人，而且极大多数是没有搬运经验的，体力方面，显然亦够不上。
    根据最低的估计，至少要化半个月以上的时间，才能复工。于是再召开会议商量，徐洁身同志说：“目前物力困难，我们应用人力去克服，以主人翁的态度来共同负责，互相帮助。”大家都认为很对，都愿以兴奋的情绪来迎接工作，要超过预定计划，完成任务。
    九月九日上午，紧张的搬运工作开始了。为了要迅速复工，有许多机件不能完全拆开，但这样却又加重了搬运的困难。正在难以解决的当儿，事务课的几位同志来了，他们是特地赶来帮我们的，本所同志也就加倍努力起来，和他们作竞赛。王正兴同志在搬运中受了伤，不但不叫痛，相反地只懊丧自己不能再参加工作。就这样，当天艰巨的任务终于给我们克服了！
    搬运工作的第二天，城站材料厂里的几位工人同志也兴匆匆赶来了，更鼓起了我们的热情。在团结、互助、友爱的气氛下，这次的搬运工作，只经过五天就全部完成。同时在这次搬运工作中，也切实考验了大家的劳动态度和工作作风。——我们大部分工作同志都开始从过去旧制度下的雇佣思想转变到新的自觉的主人翁立场上来了。
