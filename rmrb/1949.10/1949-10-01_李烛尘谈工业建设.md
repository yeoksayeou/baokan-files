　 Li Zhuchen Discusses Industrial Construction

　　Li Zhuchen has been engaged in industrial management for thirty years. When we visited him, we talked about the issue of future economic construction. His view was: "For truly large-scale and planned industrial construction, the first thing to know is where the resources actually are. Build factories where the resources are abundant. Moreover, having resources requires workers, technical personnel, capital, transportation, and consideration of the market. The prerequisite is also sufficient food. Therefore, when talking about industrialization, the first step is to restore and develop agricultural production. The first step for industry in the future is to and must face the countryside and assist in the development of agricultural production." An equally important matter, according to Li Zhuchen, is to reorganize the existing industrial equipment, break away from its semi-colonial nature, and integrate it into an independent industry, to serve as the foundation for future large-scale economic construction and industrialization. Regarding this point, Li Zhuchen added: "Some of the industries run by Japan in China are of a semi-colonial nature. For example, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant requires iron ore to come from Xuanhua, and it only produces pig iron and not steel, not angle iron or triangular iron, etc. Without a large-scale steelmaking plant to cooperate, the pig iron produced is useless. These semi-colonial industries, further damaged by the Kuomintang's reception, embezzlement, and sales, are even more incomplete. Therefore, it is necessary to make the existing industries complete, with a systematic and regular setup, in order to be an independent industry. The first step is to conduct a detailed and standardized survey and reorganization of the existing industries. We should also send technical personnel who understand machinery to Eastern European countries to investigate and understand what machines we cannot manufacture temporarily and whether they can supply them to us, and how much they can supply us."

　　The blockade by imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, has some impact on industrial development, but it has educated us that all industries cannot have a mentality of relying on foreign countries. Li Zhuchen said: "In the future, raw materials should be those we have ourselves, and industrial products should also face domestic production. China's existing industries are all deformed and without real planning. For example, some factories should not be located in Shanghai. Transporting cotton from Shaanxi or Shanxi to Shanghai, spinning it into yarn and weaving it into cloth, and then selling it back to the interior will increase many costs for transport. Transporting wheat from Henan to Hankou or Shanghai to be ground into flour and then transporting it to the north will increase many costs for transport. As social order stabilizes day by day, industries do not need to be entirely placed in cities, which is neither economical nor stable." He believes that the main reason for this deformity is: in the past, social order was unstable, and some capitalists, for fear of loss, sought refuge under the imperialist concessions. Relocating factories inland faces many difficulties. However, Li Zhuchen believes: "In the future, we must take this path. Although a large factory scale can reduce costs, it is also possible to reduce costs by locating factories near raw materials and markets, even if the scale is smaller."

　　The conversation turned from industrial construction to the People's Political Consultative Conference meeting. Li Zhuchen said: "The meeting smoothly passed six important proposals: the 'Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference', the 'Organic Law of the Central People's Government', 'designating Beiping as the capital and renaming it Beijing', 'adopting the Gregorian calendar for the era', 'provisionally designating the March of the Volunteers as the national anthem', and 'designating the five-star red flag as the national flag'. This is the concrete manifestation of the unity of people from all sectors and strata of the country."

### 李烛尘谈工业建设

 　 李烛尘谈工业建设
    李烛尘从事工业的经营有三十年的历史了。去访问他的时候，我们曾谈到今后经济建设的问题，他的看法是：“真正大规模有计划的工业建设，首先要知道资源究竟在什么地方，那个地方资源多，在那个地方建厂，而且有了资源还需要工人，需要技术人材，需要资金、交通、并顾到市场，而先决条件又要有足够的粮食，所以谈建设工业化，首先要农业生产的恢复与发展，今后的工业第一步是需要而且必须面向农村协助农业生产的发展。”同样重要的事情，李烛尘认为是：整理现有的工业设备，脱离半殖民地性，使之整体化，成为独立的工业，以为未来大规模经济建设工业化的基础。关于此点，李烛尘补充说：“日本在中国办的一些工业都是半殖民地性的，例如石景山钢铁厂，铁矿要由宣化来，而且只出生铁不出钢，不出乙字铁和三角铁等，如没有大规模的炼钢厂来配合，出了生铁却没有用处。这些半殖民地性的工业，又经国民党接收时的损毁，贪污变卖，更残缺不全了，所以需要使现有的工业完成完整的，有体系有规律的一套，才是独立的工业，而首先要将现有的工业详细正规的调查整理。并应该派懂机器的技术人员到东欧各国去考察，了解我们自己暂时不能制造的机器，他们能不能供给我们，能供给我们多少。”
    帝国主义和其走狗国民党反动派的封锁，对工业发展虽然有些影响，但却教育了我们，一切工业不能有依赖外国的心理。李烛尘说：“今后原料要用自己有的，工业品也要面对内地生产，中国现有的工业都是畸形的没有真正计划，如有些工厂有许多是不应该设在上海的，由陕西或山西运棉花到上海，纺成纱织成布，还要销到内地去，河南出的小麦运到汉口或上海磨成面粉，再运销到北方，往来运输要增加许多成本。以后社会秩序一天天稳定，工业不必要全摆在都市，那样既不经济，又不安定”。他以为造成这种畸形的主要原因是：过去社会秩序不安定，一些资本家们为了怕受损失，而托庇在帝国主义的租界之下。工厂内迁困难很多。但李烛尘认为：“将来一定要走这一条路，虽然厂子规模大可以减低成本，但就原料，就市场开工厂，却不妨规模小一点，也是同样可以减低成本的。”
    话锋由工业建设又转向人民政协开会。李烛尘说：“会上非常顺利的通过‘人民政协组织法’，‘中央人民政府组织法’，‘定都北平并改名北京’，‘纪元改用公元’，‘暂定义勇军进行曲为国歌’，‘定五星红旗为国旗’等六项重要议案，这就是全国各界各阶层人士团结一致的具体表现的。”
