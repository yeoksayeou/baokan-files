　　Preface

A series of people, driven by their broad and naive humanitarianism and national nationalism, struggled for decades, following their own direction, finding a path, walking it themselves first, and hoping that everyone would follow it, to realize their ideals. Unexpectedly, they encountered continuous but differently directed storms. From beginning to end, they stood firm, and these winds and rains tempered their quite solid physique, and they relied on the strengthening of antitoxins to extend their lives during the long months. The weather is now clearing up according to the rules. A new world is emerging, which is the direction they pointed to, but it is a road they had longed for but had not clearly discovered before. They are excited and about to move forward, and they are willing to explain to the public why they struggled in the past, how they struggled, and how they encountered hardships for a long time, even to the point of almost losing their lives, but ultimately not losing their lives. From now on, they are determined to contribute everything they have to the new world, believing that a new way of working hard should be redefined as the scope of their continued struggle. This is the general idea of what I am writing in this article.

This series of people includes those who have already left the world, and it is worth reporting: Mr. Shen Xinqing Enfu, Mr. Yuan Guanlan Xitao, Mr. Yao Zirang Wendan, Mr. Yang Yueru Baoheng, Mr. Jia Jiying Fengzhen, Mr. Gu Shuzhi Zhuo, Mr. Huang Boqiao Yi, Mr. Yu Kanglan Tailin, Mr. Liu Zhanen, Mr. Zou Taofen, and Mr. Ji Hanjun, of course, are too many to count.

    I. How was the China Vocational Education Society established?

It was founded on May 6, 1917, the sixth year of the Republic of China, at a meeting held in Shanghai. After a draft declaration was published, it gained sympathy from all sides. In addition to well-known figures in the education and industry sectors at the time, famous people from the north and south of the country, such as Cai Yuanpei, Ma Liang, Yan Xiu, Wu Tingfang, and Zhang Yuanji, were listed first in the declaration.

At that time, a new contradiction arose in Chinese society. Based on the establishment of the Republic of China, education was widely promoted in various provinces, and the number of middle schools in a county suddenly increased to more than one hundred. However, most of its graduates had no way out. The Jiangsu Provincial Education Association published education survey statistics every year, showing that only about 25 percent of middle school graduates went on to higher education, while those who sought employment but could not find it accounted for half, or even more than half. At the same time, due to the outbreak of the World War, imports suddenly decreased, and the industrial sector wanted to promote the manufacture of domestic goods to fill the gap, but suffered from a lack of technical personnel. Its founding declaration was based on this phenomenon, criticizing the large-scale expansion of ordinary middle schools as aimless and unplanned education, and loudly advocating a major reform of education policy, which must closely link education with life. It was willing to take the lead in advocating this.

The charter clearly reveals its purpose, which is threefold. The first is to prepare for the improvement of education. The second is to prepare students to serve society. And the third point is to prepare China and the world to increase production. At that time, no one in China mentioned increasing production, starting with education. It was the first voice.

Its ultimate goal is to enable the unemployed to have jobs and the employed to enjoy their work.

In the following year, 1918, the seventh year of the Republic of China, it established a China Vocational School in Shanghai. It had ironworking, woodworking, button, and enamel departments. The former two belonged to the basic training of hand-brain coordination, which is also the basic factor for the development of general industry. The latter two, it saw from the customs import and export statistics that the number of these two kinds of imports suddenly increased, but in fact it was not difficult to resist them. It wanted to take the lead in manufacturing domestic goods from this aspect—later, these two kinds of domestic goods did resist foreign goods, especially the enamel industry, with a large increase in the number of such factories in Shanghai, most of which had graduates from the China Vocational School. Its declaration of increasing production for China from education was initially a small and effective experiment.

At the same time, it published the "Education and Vocation" monthly magazine and compiled many books on vocational education to explain the theory and methods of vocational education.

    II. It grew stronger.

Vocational education was originally firmly established in theory. "Hou Ji taught the people how to farm" illustrates a history of social development. Education is not an ornament of the bourgeoisie, but a leading force in the evolution of human life. According to the new theory, hand-brain joint training is indeed the most basic skill in human life education.

But it, very early on, fought against feudal society. From the time of its birth, it suffered from the attacks of stubborn factions in the education sector. This faction believed that elegant education was the orthodox education. What would it be like if education aimed to solve the problem of human life! So they scolded vocational education as "evil education." Isn't this a complete feudal style! But it was greatly sympathized with by students' parents because it could actually open up a way out for students. Hand-brain joint training met the natural requirements of physical and mental development during adolescence, and it was greatly sympathized with by students. It also vigorously promoted cooperation between education and industry, which was beneficial to both sides of education supplying the needs of industry. At the same time, vocational schools had a considerable scale of machinery and equipment to implement new-style work internships, using facts to show and refresh the eyes of visitors—at that time, society hated empty talk the most—especially important was that most of its graduates could closely supply the requirements of the industrial and commercial circles. Because students adhered to its school motto "Labor is sacred" and "Benefit comes after the masses, responsibility comes before others"—shortly after the establishment of the China Vocational School, it added a business department, which could cooperate with the financial and industrial and commercial circles, making entrepreneurs and general production patriots believe that vocational education was the only necessary road to public and private well-being. After obtaining these assistance, it became a vigorous vanguard force in society.

In the middle, however, because the machinery, woodworking, button, and enamel factories run by the China Vocational School all lost money at the same time and owed a lot of debts, there was no way to alleviate the debt burden except by issuing a bond that would repay principal and interest on a regular basis. The bonds had to be signed by someone with outstanding credit before the creditors would accept them as collateral. So he asked Song Hanzhang, the leader of the financial community in Shanghai at that time, who had the highest reputation, to sign his name. Hanzhang replied: Unless you let me check the accounts and there are no errors, I am willing to sign my name. One morning, Hanzhang went to the school and spent half a day checking the school accounts. He asked if there were any errors? The answer was no. The three words "Song Hanzhang" were written on it. Since then, the bonds have been popular, and the school and factory's reputation has become more solid. At the same time, these practical methods were taught to its general students.

From the year of its establishment, the earliest donations to it were: (1) Overseas Chinese in the Philippines donated a lump sum of Philippine currency, and (2) Overseas Chinese leader Chen Jiageng in Nanyang donated a fixed amount of money to it every year from the year of its establishment, which lasted for five years. It maintained its credit with all its strength for these donors. When students of the China Vocational School had products, it would transport these products to Nanyang to hold exhibitions, which caused a sensation, indicating that the annual donations were not in vain.

At that time, many parties were happy to donate money to it. And those who donated the most money and continued to donate it almost indefinitely were Nie Yuntai, Xu Jingren, Mu Shuzai, the Ouchu brothers, Liu Baisheng, etc., who were all emerging textile giants at the time. Most of them also entrusted it to design vocational schools or designated locations to entrust it to establish vocational schools. Educational visiting groups from various provinces visited vocational schools in Shanghai, and after returning, they entrusted it to design them one after another. Vocational education became a new fashion for a time.

In 1922, the eleventh year of the Republic of China. The Beijing government issued a new school system, which established the position of vocational education in the secondary education stage. Vocational schools were equivalent to junior and senior high schools.

At that time, the National Education Association Federation held meetings in various provinces in rotation every year, and it followed suit at the same time and place—later not necessarily at the same time and place—to hold member conferences or vocational school federations or achievement exhibitions.

    III. It encountered blows.

The National Government gave it relentless blows from the beginning. Of course, there were some complex factors in this, but the main thing was that there was a fact that could be announced. As early as 1923, the twelfth year of the Republic of China, at that time, its负责人 was also the 负责人 of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association. The Kuomintang wanted to launch party work underground in Shanghai, using the name of setting up civilian schools on a large scale. Wang Jingwei asked these 负责人 to come forward and pretend that these schools were established by the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association. These 负责人 thought, our bases are all outside the Shanghai Concession. Under the tyranny of the warlords, how can we do this? So they politely refused. Soon, the Kuomintang held a conference in the Shanghai Concession. Wang Jingwei publicly scolded the education run by these people as "hypocritical education" and was full of unhappiness with these people, but could not point out the shortcomings of these people. The name of hypocritical education was the expression of this kind of mentality. At the same time, a name was created for its group of people, called "educational warlords." Some people even created the slogan "If you are not revolutionary, you are counter-revolutionary."

In 1927, the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, when the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai, a great persecution came. The Jiangsu Provincial Education Association was closed, and its property was liquidated. As a result of the liquidation, there was nothing to criticize, and it was confiscated. At the same time, thugs were sent to surround the society and force the staff to write a note proving that its 负责人 was reactionary, but the staff solemnly refused. They smashed the office, sealed it up, and drove all the staff out of the suburbs of Shanghai in carts. This happened on April 23. The next day, thugs were sent to the China Vocational School again, and the pistol was pointed at the principal's chest, forcing him to hand over the school and factory. Just as the principal was firmly refusing, a large group of students and workers came out, shouting "This is our school, this is our factory, whoever comes to take it over, we will fight with them." The thugs dispersed.

At that time, Ning and Han had split, and the Kuomintang government led by Chiang Kai-shek was going further and further down the wrong path. It, on the one hand, was fighting against feudal society, and had already won in education. At the same time, it advocated creating domestic goods to resist foreign goods. Before the "September 18th Incident," this group of people had already seen that Japan was about to attack and advocated resistance. It was long dissatisfied with the government's condoning of imperialist aggression. Especially because of the Life Weekly incident, although it tried its best to avoid persecution, it was ultimately unable to obtain the complete understanding of the reactionary government.

At that time, although its crisis was like the past, this did not mean that it could live in harmony with the Kuomintang government. The twists and turns and the hardships it had to deal with, thinking about it today, are really unbearable to recall. Analyzing it calmly, what it has always insisted on is that, based on political views, it cannot be reconciled with the increasingly reactionary policies of the Kuomintang government. This is the main reason. Although its slogans of vocational sacredness and vocational equality are still only ideals in capitalist society, this ideal has a very clear premise, that is, anti-feudalism, and its increasingly supporting feudal forces do not match the smell of the Kuomintang. A group of people advocated creating domestic goods, nationalism, which was the basic proposition it revealed from the beginning, and the increasingly absurd traitorous policies of the Kuomintang government are even more incompatible. However, a set of practices that a group of people have honed out of 20 to 30 years of hard struggle cannot be absolutely accommodated on the front, but it may not be possible to deal with it on the side. Within the scope of a certain work with the same trend, it may not be possible to deal with it, but the foothold is absolutely unshakable. Therefore, during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, it had superficial cooperation with the Kuomintang government. A group of people also sold extremely high efforts, such as raising war bonds. Relying on private forces, they raised a considerable amount. Once the Anti-Japanese War ended and the Liberation War began, it had found a clear position, and of course it was even more noticed by the authorities. Therefore, it constantly encountered oppression, and its 负责人 was subjected to long-term surveillance.

    IV. How could it not be eliminated?

Of course, it has accumulated many years of reputation in society. Although the National Government hated it, it did not dare to take action lightly. At the same time, it is also worth reviewing their practices.

I use a purely objective attitude to rigorously criticize the strengths and weaknesses of this group of people—including the 负责人 of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association at the beginning and its 负责人 later—in the past 45 years—from the end of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty to the present. I will write it down bit by bit below:

(1) They have ideals, but their methods of realizing their ideals are only speeches and words, and they have never lacked action. That is, there is action, but it is limited to education and lacks political nature. To be more precise, it lacks revolutionary political nature—for example, a lot of students have been educated by themselves, but there has never been an organization—the Anti-Japanese War is an exception. They have actions, and a group of them are organized.

(2) They also know the masses and can contact the masses. For example, in Xugongqiao in Kunshan and the western suburbs of Shanghai, they can make the rural masses follow them in doing practical anti-Japanese work. In Shanghai, they have run many cram schools. Before the "August 13th Incident," there were more than 10,000 students at the same time during the most prosperous period, but there was a lack of regular organization.

(3) Everyone has a unique style, and every period can be free from the threats and inducements of evil forces. For example, when supporting Emperor Hongxian, the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association, which they were responsible for, was the first to send a telegram of opposition, so Yuan Shikai hated them the most and criticized them with eight words: "Do not do officials, stir up trouble when things happen." It can also be seen that dictators are exhausted in dealing with righteous factions who are rich and cannot be promiscuous, and cannot be subdued by force. And they are especially afraid that they can stir up trouble. —But although they oppose evil forces, they have never had a plan and courage to lead the overthrow of evil forces.

(4) When it comes to education, they can indeed absorb the latest theories and methods, lead the general education sector, chew them over and swallow them, but their shortcomings inevitably focus on methods, and they have not been able to base themselves on the basic understanding of space and time to form a theoretical system to use as their educational basis—vocational education, it has a set of theoretical systems, published in "Education and Vocation" during the Anti-Japanese War. But comparing it with what we know today, we can only say that it is a glimpse of light and not complete.

From the above four points, the following three points are produced:

1. From the overthrow of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, through the overthrow of Yuan Shikai, the May Fourth Movement, to the people's revolution, every event can recognize right and wrong and do its best to cooperate with the mass line, do its best to assist in development and success, but without launching, without leading. —During the Anti-Japanese War, a group of them were in Shanghai in a launch position. And among a group of them, someone was in a leadership position, which is an exception.

2. When society is gradually changing, they are still powerful elements leading the improvement. —From the end of the Qing Dynasty, they did lead the country in education. —But in the event of sudden changes, they will not be the main force.

3. They have maintained this style consistently, so they have achieved more than 30 years of self-existence and self-preservation. Otherwise, they would have been slaughtered by Yuan Shikai and the Beiyang warlords, and they would have been slaughtered by Chiang Kai-shek. How can there be today! Therefore, it is not so much that they rely on these strengths to grow stronger, it is better to say that they rely on these shortcomings to cover their lives.

Why do they keep these shortcomings? It also needs to be explained:

Thirty years ago, China was in a semi-colonial environment, and the remaining feudal forces still existed. The broad masses of people have not yet stood up. They are engaged in education work, based on humanitarianism and national nationalism. From the class point of view, they still start from the standpoint of the bourgeoisie. Education workers themselves are certainly not the bourgeoisie, but due to the connection of work, they cannot but depend on the support of the bourgeoisie. At the same time, they also supported the bourgeoisie invisibly. At that time, education workers were just like these bourgeoisie themselves, divided into progressive and backward factions, so the work line was also divided into revolutionary and reactionary types. They used all their strength to fight the enemy, and although they won the victory against the reactionary faction, they actually could not jump out of this circle. This circle is the bourgeoisie. Their shortcomings cannot be removed. If you ask where the root of the disease is, it should be said that it is on this.

    V. What is its current situation?

Its headquarters is in Shanghai, the society building is self-built, and the base is self-owned. It has members who have been solicited over the years, and there are more than 30,000 member names, but there have been too many deaths, relocations, and personnel changes. Later, due to the bad environment, it was impossible to convene a member conference. Its organization has a board of directors and supervisors. When the term of the directors and supervisors expires, they can only be elected by correspondence.

It has a research department, specializing in the theory and methods of vocational education, and also translates and publishes. There have been more than 120 kinds of publications, and the regular one is the "Education and Vocation" journal, which was founded in the year of its establishment and is still being published.

The China Vocational School currently has a mechanical engineering department, a civil engineering department, and a business department. This summer, there are more than 1,200 students. There have been more than 8,000 graduates. The school has a base of more than 20 acres, has an attached mechanical factory, and has a specially built alumni association. Many students participated in the people's revolution.

The China Iron Factory and the China Enamel Factory, which were founded and developed due to the internship needs of the students of the China Vocational School, have long become independent organizations and have stood at the forefront of their peers in Shanghai.

The China Industrial and Commercial College is what it established in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War due to the requirements of the graduates of the China Vocational School for further study. Later, it moved from Chongqing to Shanghai and developed from hardships. It currently has industrial and commercial management, accounting, banking, mechanical engineering and other departments. This summer, there are more than 700 students and more than 200 graduates. During the anti-Chiang struggle, it was called one of the democratic fortresses in Shanghai. More than 30 students and teachers were arrested, some were slaughtered, and more than 100 people participated in the people's revolution work before liberation.

Bile Middle School is what it found after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, that there were still ordinary middle schools everywhere, and graduates still had no way out. But if they were given the skills and common sense training suitable for the needs of general life, even if they did not run vocational departments, it was not impossible to obtain service opportunities in enterprise organs. Therefore, it was attached to the remaining houses of the headquarters. It has been three years now, and the junior high school has been completed. What has been achieved is: (1) the liberation of students' thinking and willingness to serve the public. (2) The method it uses strengthens individual tutoring of students in class teaching and maintains a constant record of investigation and research on the characteristics of each student, on the basis of which students are given individual guidance in learning and conduct. (3) It has also gradually realized the plan for close cooperation between the school and the students' families. It has established a parent representative meeting to advise on school finances and provide opinions on teaching and training. The state of opposition between general private schools and parents has been largely eliminated. Just as the People's Liberation Army went south, this group of teachers and students who had been liberated in their thinking went to participate in the liberation work.

The China Vocational Supplementary School was the most successful before the Anti-Japanese War. Almost all the large and small factories and shops near the seven supplementary schools had its students. It can be regarded as a vigorous event. One of the supplementary schools was located in the China Vocational School, intending to improve the cultural level of general workers in the factory, which also made a considerable contribution. After the war, under the reactionary regime, it was unable to restore it in one go, but the basic first supplementary school was located in the headquarters. There are currently more than 1,000 students, and a new plan has been drafted and is being prepared for development.

The Vocational Guidance Institute was founded in Shanghai 23 years ago. It guides students in school and introduces them to employment. This was originally a necessary measure for the municipality. The government did not do it at that time, or it was not enough, so it did it.

The Disability Reconstruction Service Center was established after the war under the commission of "Xingzong." Disability reconstruction is a new theory in education, and it is indeed very needed after the war. But for it, it is ultimately a temporary job.

Among its many publications, there is a "Life Weekly" mentioned earlier in the third section. For the sake of resisting Japan, it reissued a "National News," which supported it for 15 years. In the 36th year of the Republic of China, it was finally forced to cease publication. It also co-organized the "Prospect" weekly magazine with general friends. It was closed once before liberation and is now continuing to be published.

This is all its work in Shanghai. In addition, it is also worth briefly reporting some of its work in the interior.

Before the establishment of the National Government, it has said in the second section that it gave the various provinces the influence of vocational education. Afterwards, the development ended. For the sake of resisting Japan, it was able to have some connection with the interior under the National Government. As a result of the "August 13th" battle, Shanghai fell, and it devoted its full strength to developing towards the southwest. There are branches or offices in Sichuan, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces, and there are schools or factories, and they all have a considerable scale, which is praised by the general public. For example, the Chongqing Baishatuo China Vocational School, the Guanxian Dujiang Practical Vocational School, the Kunming China Amateur Middle School, and the Liuzhou China Iron Factory are all highly respected at the time. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, it saw that there was a new struggle in politics and would encounter new blows, so it concentrated manpower and material resources to Shanghai. Now, although offices are still set up in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming, the places have not yet been liberated, and of course everything cannot progress.

In short, during its first ten years, it grew from budding to strong, and developed very vigorously. Because of the National Government's hatred, its development was restricted. Later, it borrowed from the Anti-Japanese War, but it gave it a chance to grow a side branch. At the end of the Anti-Japanese War, its base—Shanghai, was a pitiful sight. The society building was occupied. Five-thirds of the school buildings of the China Vocational School, which had a considerable scale, were destroyed. However, due to the concentration of talents and the society's reputation for it, it still has some foundation, and it has to revive the old and build the new from the dark phenomenon, as reported above.

    VI. What will it do in the future?

What will it do in the future? This is a question that a group of them think is worth thoroughly considering.

A group of them have ideals, ambitions, and an overall plan for education. Didn't they announce three goals to the masses when it was founded? It wants to transform general education, it wants to enable general students to obtain employment opportunities. It wants to do some preparatory work for the country to increase production. Are these great ambitions, and is it enough to complete its goals by running one or two vocational schools, one vocational college, one special middle school, several vocational supplementary schools, and doing some work for social services? Of course not, it always wants to set an example for itself, to start some trends, so that the government can promote them on a large scale. But the Beiyang warlords naturally cannot say anything, and the National Government has always been awkward with it.

Now, the People's Government has been established. How should we view the People's Government under the New Democracy?

The People's Government is the government of the people. The People's Government under the New Democracy is led by the Communist Party of China, led by the proletariat, and supported by all parties. If it is considered that this view is correct, the following concepts must be corrected.

You are in power, and we are in the opposition. Of course, all national affairs depend on those of you in power, and the opposition is not responsible. This is an unacceptable concept.

Those in the opposition should also do something. Whether it is charity or culture and education, it is not necessary to participate in the overall plan, nor do you want to closely cooperate with social needs and the country's overall plan, but only want to use these as a cover for those in the opposition, or personal pastime methods. This is also an unacceptable concept.

There is also a kind of person who regards his career as privately owned. The nature of the career is originally to seek welfare for the public. As a result, it is to establish a name for private people, or even to colonize property for private people, and to turn the public into the private, which is even more unacceptable.

These concepts must be thoroughly clarified before they can be good.

Vocational education is a necessary measure for the implementation of national policies to increase production and prosper the economy in the future. The United Government was established and determined the general policy of increasing production. The first thing that must be done is to gather experts and conduct extremely careful research to propose a national production master plan that is linked for several years, which will inevitably include various agriculture, various industries, and land, sea and air transportation industries, etc., closely cooperating with each other, and any item will inevitably need a large number of talents. In addition to a part of the graduates from the university, the vast majority of what is needed must be secondary technical personnel who have received vocational training. The existing ones are far from enough, and it is necessary to quickly and effectively retrain, according to the nature of the technology and the degree of urgency, to determine the length of the training period. Isn't this vocational education? Vocational education will inevitably be very broad and very urgent in the needs of future nation-building plans. This is what I dare to firmly recognize. —In the Soviet Union in 1938, the number of students in technical schools, secondary medical schools and other vocational schools increased by 26.6 times compared with before the revolution (see Meidinsky's Soviet Education System, translated by Zhuang Jiming, page 90), this is one example.

There is also a point that vocational education in the new society will not only be unprecedented in terms of quantitative development, but also will be unprecedented in the evolution of quality. Vocational education in capitalist society, on the surface, is to solve the livelihood problems of a large number of young people—it has also done a part of improving the cultural level of workers, see the previous section V. —In essence, it is always to increase the favorable conditions for capitalists to obtain profits. The economic components of the new society are mainly the national economy of the people's masses based on workers and peasants. Even if it is private industry and commerce, it is also an economy that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, vocational education that serves such an economy will eliminate the past weaknesses and become an important condition for building a people's democratic country.

Since it has recognized the nature of the People's Government under the New Democracy, recognized the importance and urgency of vocational education in the nation-building plan, and recognized the special significance of vocational education in the new society, then, for a group of people like it who have accumulated several years of experience in vocational education, they can only contribute some of what they understand and some of what they can do to the people's government. All the things that have been created, which are not satisfied with these, are also contributed to the people's government, so that a part of the private cause is transformed into a public cause of all the people, and is forever supported by all the people, that is, forever recognizes all the people as its main body.

Let me put it concretely:

1. The schools it founded, according to their necessity and possibility, belong to the public. If it is changed to a national school, it is a member of several national vocational schools. If it is changed to a municipal school in the city where it is located, it is a member of several municipal vocational schools. At the same time, based on its experience and research, it assists the government in formulating a national or city-wide vocational education plan.

2. Other undertakings attached to it also belong to the public in the same way, according to necessity and possibility.

3. Its headquarters is changed into a general research institution for vocational education workers and vocational education researchers nationwide, under the national education administration system of the People's Government.

In this way, it is absolutely not passive, but active, absolutely not extinguished, but developed. In this way, it can embark on the right track according to the original goal, and gradually complete the great mission that it voluntarily and happily undertakes.

The words can be said again, didn't it advocate very early that the unemployed should have jobs and the employed should enjoy their work? Didn't it very early focus on solving the problem of individual livelihoods and the development of social production? It does not violate the social view of the New Democracy. At that time, why could it arise and grow stronger? Isn't it relying on the First World War, imperialism could not but relax its hand on China's national industry and commerce? This era background made China's national industry and commerce raise their heads for a short period of time, thus realizing the emptiness and uselessness of the old education, stimulating practical education—practical education was also shouted out by its 负责人 four years before it was produced, in the second year of the Republic of China, and was praised and accepted by educators across the country. —And the requirements of vocational education. Allowing it to rise in time? But this opportunity passed in a flash, China is still under the triple oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and the national economy still cannot achieve sound and rational development. Relying on it as the foundation, it is naturally unable to be incorporated into the right track. Due to these experiences and awakenings, although a group of them did not participate in the Great Revolution, they did participate in the Anti-Japanese War, the democratic movement, and the patriotic self-defense liberation struggle. In these three stages, a group of them gained full confidence to welcome the new era and participated in the construction of a new democratic society with the greatest excitement. Hoping to realize socialism and communism as soon as possible, a group of them have also clearly realized one point, that is, only by realizing socialism and communism can the human vocational problem be solved in the most practical and perfect way, and can it fully complete its greatest mission of "the unemployed having jobs" and "the employed enjoying their work."

　　Postscript

Some people say: Vocational education is a product of the capitalist system. Is this term applicable at present, and I am afraid it will become a problem. I replied like this:

What we are fighting for is the reality, not the name. The name only needs to express its internal meaning, but it must be expressed correctly, the more correct the better.

Vocational education is not only a product of the capitalist system, but also a product of the feudal system (China's past society is a coexistence of these two, and the meaning of feudalism is not weaker than capital, which I feel), but it itself is popular, produced to solve the livelihood problems of the common people, and is progressive. For example, if you ask, is Wallace an American? Yes, Wallace was born in the United States, but not the American Empire, is America and not the Empire. If you say that everything produced in capitalist society and feudal society is problematic, then isn't all education produced and evolved from these? Isn't science the same?

But the words have to be said back, stepping into the realm of socialism and communism, the livelihoods of the common people will not become a problem. To take a step back, when the New Democracy realizes the development of production and the prosperity of the economy, the livelihoods of the common people will not become a problem. Therefore, vocational education can be said to be a development, growth, and decline in the past under a specific economic system, but this sentence only explains the process of this term. If you talk about its content, about the basics, it is hand-brain joint training, about specific work, for example, hard, such as machine manufacturing, soft, such as the writing and writing of documents, to train to make things correct, exquisite, and economical, these are the contents of this term, these are probably indispensable in any society.

If we find a new term other than vocational education that can accurately express these contents, we are extremely welcome and should be sought by everyone.

    一系列的人受了他们广泛的天真的人道主义和国家民族主义这些思想的驱使，前前后后奋斗了几十年，依他们的方向，找出一条路，自己先走，走通了，希望大家走，来实现他们的理想，不料中间遭遇了连续性的却是不同方向的无数阵的暴风雨，他们自始至终总是植立着，倒借了这些风和雨，磨炼成功了他们相当坚实的体格，还靠了抗毒素的加强，在漫长的几月里。延续了他们的生命。天气依着规律性大放晴光了。当前呈现出一个新的世界。正是他们所指着的方向，却是他们从前憧憬着还没有清楚地发现的道路。他们兴奋了，将要拔步前进的时候，愿意向着大众，说明他们过去为什么奋斗？怎样奋斗？和长期的怎样怎样遭遇艰苦？艰苦到几于丧失生命而到底没有丧失的种种事实和缘由。以及从今以后，立志把他们所有一切的一切，贡献给新的世界，认为该重定一种新的努力方式，作为他们继续奋斗的范畴。这就是我所写这篇文章的大意。
    这一系列的人，有已经离开世界的，值得报告一下：沈信卿先生恩孚，袁观澜先生希涛，姚子让先生文ｄāｎ＠①，杨月如先生保恒，贾季英先生丰臻，顾述之先生倬，黄伯樵先生异，俞抗澜先生泰临，刘湛恩先生，邹韬奋先生，季寒筠先生当然数是数不尽的。
    一、中华职业教育社是怎样产生的呢？
    它是公元一九一七年，中华民国六年五月六日在上海开会宣告成立的。一篇宣言书草案发表后，大得各方同情。署名的，当时教育实业两界知名人士以外，全国南北名人蔡元培，马良，严修，伍廷芳，张元济等，在宣言书上是首列的。
    当时中国的社会，新发生一种矛盾现象，基于民国成立，各省大量推广教育，中学校一县有骤增到一百所以上的。但它的毕业生大都没有出路，江苏省教育会年年公布教育调查统计，中学毕业生升学者仅占百分之二十五左右，求事而不得事者，占到半数，甚至半数以上。同时却因世界大战发生，舶来品骤然减少，实业界很想推广制造国货来承乏，而苦于缺少技术人员。它的发起宣言，就针对着这种现象立论，对于大量扩充普通性的中学，认为是无目的无计划的教育，严切地加以评正，大声疾呼着主张大改革教育政策，必须把教育和生活密切地联系，它愿首先这样尝试倡导起来。
    社章里明确地揭示它的目的，有三点，第一是改良教育的准备。第二是替学生谋服务社会的准备。而第三点，就是替中国和世界谋增加生产的准备，那时候，中国还没有人提到增加生产，从教育下手，它是第一声。
    它所提出终极的目标，是使无业者有业，使有业者乐业。
    明年一九一八年，民国七年它在上海创立了一所中华职业学校。设有铁工，木工，钮扣，珐琅各科，前两者，属于教育上手脑并用的基本教练，也是发展一般工业的基本因素，后两者，它从海关输出入统计上看出这两种舶来数量骤增，而实际上倒不难抵制，想从这上边做个国货制造的先导，——后来这两种国货，到底抵制住了外货，尤其是珐琅业上海这类工厂数大增，大都有中华职业学校毕业生在内，它从教育上为中国增加生产的宣言，算初度小小试验有效。
    同时，它发行“教育与职业”月刊，编行不少关于职业教育专书，拿来阐明职业教育的理论和方法。
    二、它壮大起来了。
    职业教育本来在理论上着实站得住的，“后稷教民稼穑”就说明了一部社会发展史，教育不是资产阶级的装饰品，而是在人类生活进化上会起一种领导作用的。就依新的学说，手脑联合训练，确是人类生活教育上最基本的工夫。
    但是它呢，很早就和封建社会搏斗，它从产生时起饱受了教育界顽固派的打击，这一派人认为文雅教育，才是正统教育，教育而谋解决人类生活问题，还成什么话！所以辱骂职业教育为“作孽教育”这不是十足的封建作风吗！而它却因实际上能为学生打开出路，大得学生家长同情，手脑联合训练，适合青年期身心发展的自然要求，大得学生同情，而又盛倡教育与实业合作，教育供给实业需求的双方有利，同时职业学校拥有相当规模的机械设备，施行新式的工作实习，用事实来表现，使来观者眼界一新——那时候社会最厌恨空论——尤重要的，它的毕业生大部分确能亲切地供给工商界的要求。因为学生服膺它的校训“劳工神圣”“利居众后，责在人先”——中华职业学校成立不久，添设商科，尤能与金融界工商界合作，使企业家与一般生产救国论者，笃信职业教育是为公为私必要的惟一的康庄大道。它从得到了这些助力以后，就在社会上成为蓬蓬勃勃地富于有生力量的一枝先锋部队。
    中间却因中华职业学校所办机械、木工、钮扣、珐琅各厂同时赔本，负债很多，没办法，想发行一种债券，定期还本付息，拿来减轻债累，债券上须有信用卓著者署名，各债户才肯受抵。就向那时候上海声望最高的金融界领袖宋汉章商请署名，汉章答：除非让我去查帐，一点不错误，我才愿署名。某日清早，汉章果到校，耗了半天的时间，查完了校帐，问有错误么？答没有。“宋汉章”三字写上了。从此债券风行，而学校和工厂信誉更坚固。同时把这些踏实的作风，教它一般的学生。
    从它成立那年起，把金钱最早捐给它的：（一）菲列宾华侨趸数捐给了一注菲币，（二）南洋华侨领袖陈嘉庚从成立那年起，每年把额定金钱捐给它，连续了五年，它对这些捐金人是用全力维持信用的，到中华职业学校学生有出品时，它就把这些出品运到南洋开展览会，轰动了一时，说明每年捐款并没有白费。
    那时候，各方乐于把金钱捐给它的不少。而捐金最多，且继续捐给，几于无限期的，就是聂云台、徐静仁、穆恕再、藕初兄弟、刘柏生等等，都是当时新兴的纺织界巨子，他们多数还委托它设计职业学校，或指定地点委托它创办职业学校。各省教育参观团到上海参观了职业学校，回去以后，纷纷委托设计，职业教育一时成为新的风尚。
    一九二二年，民国十一年。北京政府颁布了新学制，在中等教育阶段，确定了职业教育的地位，职业学校相当于初级和高级中学。
    那时候，全国教育会联合会每年轮流在各省开会，它就追随着同时同地——后来不一定同时同地——举行社员大会或职业学校联合会或成绩展览会。
    三、它遭遇打击了。
    国民政府自始即予它以无情的打击，这中间当然有些复杂的因素，主要倒有一件事实，可以公告的，远在一九二三年，民国十二年，那时候，它的负责人同时是江苏省教育会负责人，国民党在上海欲从地下展开党的工作，借广设平民学校名义，由汪精卫向这些负责人商请出面，把这些学校都伪作江苏省教育会设立，这些负责人一想，我们的根据地都在上海租界以外，在军阀淫威之下，怎么可以呢？就婉转拒绝了。不久，国民党在上海租界开大会，汪精卫当众骂这些人所办教育是“乡愿教育”，对这些人满肚子不痛快，而指不出这些人的坏处，乡愿教育的名称就是这种心里的表现。同时，就替它一群人起一个名词，叫“学阀”。有等人还创出“不革命即反革命”的口号。
    一到一九二七年，民国十六年，国民革命军到上海，大迫害来了，江苏省教育会被封闭，财产被清算，清算结果，无可指摘，予以没收，同时派暴徒围困社所，迫令工作人员写字据，证明它的负责人是反动，却给工作人员严正拒绝，就捣毁了办公室，把它封闭起来，所有工作人员赶上大车逐出上海郊外。这是四月二十三日的事。隔一天，又派暴徒到中华职业学校，将手枪指定校长的胸口，逼令交出学校和工厂，校长正坚拒时，大群学生工人出来了，大呼“这是我们的学校，这是我们的工厂，谁来接收，和谁拚命”。暴徒散去了。
    那时候，宁汉已分裂、蒋介石所领导的国民党政府，一天一天，路越走越错，它呢，对内和封建社会作战，在教育上已胜利了。同时对外是主张倡造国货来抵制外货的。还没有到“九一八”，它这群人早看出日本将下手，主张抵抗的。它早不满意于政府纵容帝国主义的侵略，尤其是为了生活周刊事件，它虽使尽技巧，求免于迫害，到底无法获得反动政府彻底谅解。
    那时候，它的危机虽象过去，这并不等于它就能和国民党政府和谐相处，其中经历的曲折，应付的艰苦，到今天想来，真是不堪回首，冷静地分析一下，它所始终坚持的，是基于政治上看法，和越来越反动的国民党政府的政策，无法调和，这是主因而它所唱出职业神圣，职业平等诸口号，虽然还只是资本主义社会里的理想，但这理想有一个很鲜明的前提就是反封建，和国民党越来越支持封建势力的气味，总是不相投的，它一群人主张倡造国货，民族主义，是它一开始就揭示的基本主张，和国民党政府越来越不成话的卖国政策，更是水火不能相容，但是，它一群人从二三十年艰苦奋斗中间磨炼出来的一套做法，正面绝对不通融的，但侧面未始不可以周旋，在趋向相同的某项工作范围内，未始不可以周旋，但立脚点是绝对不动摇的。所以对日抗战八年中间，它和国民党政府曾有过表面的合作，它一群人且曾卖过极高度的气力，例如劝募战时公债靠私人的力量，募到相当多的数量。一到抗战结束，解放战争开始，它已经找到了明确的立场，当然更为当局所侧目，于是它不断的遭遇压迫，它的负责人受到长期的监视。
    四、它怎么不会被消灭的呢？
    当然，它在社会上积下多少年信誉，国民政府虽然忌恨它，也不敢轻于下手。同时倒也值得检讨一下他们的作风。
    我用纯客观的态度，把这群人——包括初时的江苏省教育会负责人和后来它的负责人，在过去四十五年中间——从清光绪末到现在，很严正地批判他们的长处和短处。一点一点写在下边：
    （一）他们有理想的，但他们实现理想的方法，却只有言论和文字，而从来缺乏行动。即有行动，只限于教育性，而缺乏政治性，正确些说来，缺乏革命的政治性，——例如前前后后自己教育出来的学生着实不少不少，但从来没有组织——对日抗战是例外的，他们有行动了，他们一群人有组织了。
    （二）他们也认识群众，也能联系群众，例如它在昆山徐公桥，在上海西郊等处，能使农村群众跟着他们干实际的抗日工作，它在上海市曾办很多处补习学校，“八一三”以前最盛期间，同时有学生一万多人，但缺乏经常性的组织。
    （三）他们每一个人都有特立独行的风格，每一时期都能不受恶势力的威胁和利诱。例如拥戴洪宪皇帝，他们所负责的江苏省教育会首先通电反对，所以袁世凯最痛恨他们，批评他们八个字：“与官不做，遇事生风。”也可见独裁者对富贵不淫，威武不屈的正义派穷于应付。而又特别畏惧他们能生出风来。——但他们虽反对恶势力，从来没有领导推翻恶势力的计划和魄力。
    （四）说到教育，他们确能吸收最新的理论和方法，领导一般教育界，加以咀嚼而咽下去的，但他们的缺点，不免偏重方法，而没有能本着空间时间的基本认识，而构成理论体系，拿来做他们的教育根据，——职业教育，它有一套理论体系，发表于抗战期间“教育与职业”上边。但把今天我们认识的来对照，只能说是一隙之明，还没有完整。
    从上开四点的因，产生了下开三点的果：
    一、他们从推翻满清之役起，经过倒袁运动，五四运动，直到人民革命，每一事变，都能认清是非，向着群众路线尽力地配合，尽力地援助发展成功，却没有发动，没有领导。——对日抗战，它一群人在上海倒是处于发动。而它一群人中间，倒有人处于领导地位的这是例外。
    二、社会在渐变时，他们不失为领导改进的有力分子。——从清末起，在教育上确曾领导全国。——但到突变时，他们不会做主力军。
    三、他们就为了一贯地保持着这种作风，才取得三十多年的自存和自全。否则不被屠杀于袁世凯和北洋军阀，必被屠杀于蒋介石。那还有今日！所以，与其说他们靠这些长处壮大起来，还不如说他们就靠这些短处，掩护着他们的生命。
    究竟为什么他们留着这些缺点呢？也得说明一下：
    三十年前，中国在半殖民地的环境中，残余的封建势力还存在着，广大的民众，还没有站起来。他们干教育工作，所根据是人道主义，是国家民族观念。从阶级方面说，他们还是从资产阶级的立场出发的，教育工作者本身当然不是资产阶级，但由于工作的联系，他们不可能不依存资产阶级的支持。同时在无形中他们也就支持了资产阶级。那时候，教育工作者正和这些资产阶级本身一样，分做进步和落后两派，因而工作路线也就分做革命和反动两种。他们使用了全身气力和敌人搏斗，虽对反动派争斗取得胜利，实际上总是跳不出这圈子。这圈子就是资产阶级。他们缺点的去不掉，若问病根所在，应该说就在这上边。
    五、它现状怎样呢？
    它的社本部，在上海，社屋自建，基地自置，它有历年征求得来的社员，社员名楷，积有三万多，但死亡迁移，人事上变更太多了，后来为了环境的恶劣，无法召开社员大会，它的组织有理监事会，到理监事任期满了，只有用通讯来选举。
    它有研究部，专研究职业教育的理论和方法，同时翻译出版，出版物前后统计有一百二十多种，经常的是“教育与职业”期刊，从它成立之年创始的，现时还在出版。
    中华职业学校现设机械科，土木科，商科。今夏共有学生一千二百多人。前后毕业生共八千几百人，校有基地二十多亩，有附设机械工场，有特建的校友会。学生参加人民革命的不少。
    因中华职业学校学生实习需要而创设并发展起来的中华铁工厂，中华珐琅厂，都早成为独立的组织，在上海他们的同业里，都已站在前列的地位。
    中华工商专科学校，是对日抗战期间，它在重庆，因中华职业学校毕业生进修的要求而设立起来的。后来由重庆迁上海，从艰苦中发展。现设工商管理，会计，银行，机械等科。今夏有学生七百多人，前后毕业生有二百多人，当反蒋斗争时，被称为上海民主堡垒之一，学生教师被拘捕的三十多人，有被屠杀的，在解放前，参加人民革命工作的有一百多人。
    比乐中学，是它在抗战结束以后，发现到处都还是普通性中学，毕业生仍然没有出路。但如予以适于一般生活所需要技能和常识的训练，虽没有办职业科，并不是不可以取得企业机关服务机会的，因此，就社本部余屋附设这个中学，现届三年，初中修了，所已经做到的，（一）学生思想上的解放，和乐于为公众服务。（二）它所用方法，于班级教学中加强学生的个别辅导，对每个学生的特点，保有经常的调查研究的记录，以此为根据对学生予以学习和品行的个别指导。（三）还逐渐地实现了学校和学生家庭间密切合作的计划，设家长代表会议，顾问学校财政，提供教学训导的意见，一般私立学校和家长对立的状态大体已消灭。恰值人民解放军南下，这班教师和思想已经解放的学生，纷纷地前去参加解放工作了。
    中华职业补习学校，在抗战以前最办得出色，七个补校所在地附近的大小工厂商店几乎都有它的学生。算得轰轰烈烈了。中间一所补校，就设在中华职业学校内，意在提高工厂一般工人文化水准，亦颇有相当贡献，战后在反动的政权下，没有能一气恢复，但作为基本的第一补校就设在社本部里面。现有学生一千多人，已草有新的计划，正在筹备发展。
    职业指导所，是它从二十三年以前在上海创办起来的。一面指导学生就学，一面介绍就业。这原是市政上一种必要的措施，当时政府没有办，或办得不够，它就办起来了。
    伤残重建服务处，是它在战后受“行总”委托而办起来的。伤残重建，在教育上是一种新的理论，事实上在战后确很需要。但在它方面说来，到底是一种临时性的工作。
    在它的若干出版物之中，有一种“生活周刊”在前面第三节里先提到过了。为了抗日，它重新发行一种“国讯”，前后支撑了十五年。到民国三十六年终于被迫停刊，它又和一般朋友合办“展望”周刊，解放前一度被封闭，今在继续出版中。
    这都是它在上海的工作，这以外，还值得略略报告一些它在内地的一些工作。
    国民政府成立以前，它给与各省的职业教育影响，已于第二节说过了，其后终止发展，为了抗战，它才得在国民政府之下，稍微向内地发生些联系。“八一三”战役之结果，淞沪陷落，它就倾它的全力，向着西南发展。川、桂、滇三省都有分社或办事处，都有学校或工厂，且都具有相当规模，给一般人称道，例如重庆白沙沱中华职业学校，灌县都江实用职业学校，昆明中华业余中学，中华小学柳州中华铁工厂等，都为当时当地推重，抗战结束，它看到政治上有一种新的斗争，且将遭遇新的打击，就将人力物力向上海集中，到现在，重庆、成都、昆明虽还设有办事处，但地方都还没有解放，一切当然无法进展。
    总之，它的第一个十年中间，由萌芽而壮大起来，是很蓬蓬勃勃地发展的。为了国民政府的忌恨，就限制了它的发展，后来，借了抗日斗争，却给它一种旁枝的茁长机会，抗战结束，它的根据地——上海，一片可怜景象，社屋被人占住了。具有相当规模的中华职业学校五分之三的校舍被毁了。它呢，却因人才的集中，社会对它的信誉留下些基础，还得从昏天黑地的现象之下，把旧的复兴起来，新的建设起来，象上面报告的这些。
    六、它今后怎样呢？
    今后它将怎样呢？这是它一群人认为值得澈头澈尾郑重考虑的问题。
    它一群人是有理想的，有抱负的，对教育是有整个计划的，从它创始时不是已向着群众宣布三个目标么？它要改造一般教育，它要使一般学生获得就业机会。它要替国家做一番增加生产的准备工夫，这样地志大言大，难道办了一二所职业学校，一所职业性的专科学校，一所特殊性的中学校，若干职业补习学校和干了若干为社会服务的工作，就算完成它的目标么？当然不是的，它总想自己先立一个榜样，开一些风气，让政府大量推行。可是北洋军阀自然一切都说不上，国民政府，始终和它闹蹩扭。
    现在，人民政府成立起来了。对新民主主义下的人民政府的看法，该怎样呢？
    人民政府，是人民的政府。新民主主义下的人民政府，是由无产阶级领导者中国共产党领导着，由各方面共同支持着的政府，如果认为这种看法对的话，下开几种观念必须纠正的。
    你们是在朝的，我们是在野的，国家一切事情，当然靠托你们在朝者，在野恕不负责。这是一种要不得的观念。
    在野的也该做一些事。慈善也好，文化教育也好，不必参加整个计划，也不想跟社会需求和国家整个计划密切地配合，只想借这些作为在野者的幌子，或个人的消遣方法，罢了。这又是一种要不得的观念。
    又有一种，把他的事业作为私人所占有。事业的性质，原是为公众谋福利的，结果为了私人立名，甚或为了私人殖产，把公的变为私的，那更万万要不得了。
    这些观念，都要彻底予以廓清，才好。
    职业教育，是今后增加生产繁荣经济的国策实施时所必要采取的措施。联合政府成立，确定了增加生产大方针。第一件事必需集合专家经过极慎重的研究，提出一分联续若干年的全国性的生产总计划，中间必将包括各种农业，各种工业以及水陆空交通运输业等等密切地相互配合着，而任何一项，必然需要大量人才。除一部分毕业于大学以外，绝大部分所需要的，必然是受过职业训练的中等技术人员，现有的万万不够，必然需要迅速切实地重新训练，依技术的性质，和需要急迫的程度，定训练期间的长短。这不是职业教育，是什么？职业教育，在今后建国大计的需要上必然地很广大而且很急迫，我所敢坚决认定的。——苏联一九三八年技术学校中等医科学校和其他职业学校学生，比革命前增加了二十六·六倍（见梅丁斯基苏联教育制度，庄季铭译本第九○页），此其一例。
    还有一点，新社会职业教育，不仅在量的发展上将是空前的，就在质的进化上，亦将史无前例。资本主义社会里的职业教育，表面上是为大量青年解决生计问题——在它亦已做到一部分的提高劳工文化水准，见前第五节。——实质上总是为资本家增加获得利润的有利条件，新社会的经济成分，主要的是属于以工农为基础的人民大众的国家经济，即使是私人工商业，也是有利于国计民生的经济。因此，为这样经济服务的职业教育，便消失了过去的弱点，而成为建设人民民主国家的重要条件。
    既然认清了新民主主义下人民政府的性质，认清了建国大计上需求职业教育的重要而且急迫，又认清了新社会职业教育的特殊意义。那么，对于职业教育积有若干年经验象它一群人，只有把所有懂得的一些，会得的一些，都贡献给人民的政府，所有已经造成的一些，本不以这一些为满足的，也都拿来贡献给人民的政府，使一部分私人的事业，化为全体人民公共的事业，而永远为全体人民所支持，即永远认全体人民为它的主体。
    让我具体说来：
    １、它所创办的学校，依其必要和可能，归之于公家。如改国立，即是若干国立职业性学校的一分子，如改所在市市立，即是若干市立职业性学校的一分子，同时根据它的经验和研究所得，由它协助政府制定一分全国或全市的职业教育计划。
    ２、它所附设的其他事业，同样地依必要和可能归之于公家。
    ３、它的社本部，改为全国职业教育工作人员和职业教育研究者研究总机构，隶属于人民政府全国教育行政系统之下。
    这样，它绝对不是消极，而倒是积极，绝对不是消灭，而倒是发展。这样，才使它依据原定的目标，走上正轨，得以一步一步地完成它所自动地乐于负担的伟大使命。
    话还可以回头说一下，它不是很早标榜着要使无业者有业，有业者乐业吗？它不是很早着眼于个人生计问题的解决和社会生产的发展吗？它和新民主主义的社会观，并没有违反的，在当时，它之所以能产生，能壮大，还不是靠那第一次世界大战，帝国主义对中国民族工商业不能不放松一手，这一个时代背景，使中国民族工商业，短时期抬了一下头，因而觉悟到旧教育的空虚，不济事，刺戟了实用教育——实用教育也是它负责人在它产生前四年，民国二年喊出，而得到全国教育家赞许且接受的。——和职业教育的要求。容许它乘时崛起么？可是这机运一霎眼过去了，中国依然在帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义三重压迫之下，国民经济依然得不到健全合理的发展，靠这些做基础的它，自然也无法纳入正轨，由于这些经验和觉醒，它这群人虽然没有参加大革命，毕竟参加了抗日战争，民主运动，和爱国自卫的解放战斗，在这三个阶段中，它一群人得到了充分的信心，来迎接新的时代，把最大的兴奋，来参加新民主主义社会的建设。希望早日实现社会主义，共产主义，它一群人并且已经清楚地认识了一点，就是只有实现社会主义和共产主义，才能使人类职业问题获得最实际而美满的解决，才能十足地完成它最伟大的“无业者有业”“有业者乐业”的使命。
    　　　　　　　　　　一九四九年民国三十八年八月八日北平
    　　　　后言
    有人说：职业教育，是资本制度下的产物，现时这名词是否适用，怕成问题了，我是这样答复的：
    我们所争，在实不在名，名只须表达它内在的意义，不过要表达得正确，越正确越好。
    职业教育，不但是资本制度下的产物，而且还是封建制度下的产物（中国过去的社会，是这两种并存的，而且封建的意味，并不较淡于资本，我所感到，是这样的），但它本身是平民化的，是为解决平民生计问题而产生出来的，是进步的，例如问，华莱士是美国人么？不错，华莱士生在美国的，但不是美帝，是美而非帝，若说凡产生在资本社会，封建社会里的东西，都成问题，那么全部教育不都从这些中间产生而演变出来的么？科学不也是这样吗？
    话倒要说回头的，踏进了社会主义，共产主义的境界，平民生计不会成问题的，就退一步说，新民主主义到实现了发展生产，繁荣经济的时候，平民生计，也不会成问题的，所以职业教育，可以说它应该是过去在特定经济制度下由发展而成长而衰亡的，但这句话只说明了这个名词的过程，若说到它的内容，关于基本，是手脑联合训练，关于具体工作，举例说来，硬性的，如机器制造，软性的如文书的作和写，要训练到做出来的东西正确，精美、经济，这都是这名词的内容，这些怕是任何社会里不可少的。
    如果在职业教育以外，找到一个新的名词，能正确表达这些内容，我们是极端欢迎的，并且应该大家寻求的。
