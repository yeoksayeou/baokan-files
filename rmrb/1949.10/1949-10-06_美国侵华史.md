　　A History of American Aggression Against China
    Liu Danian
        IV　Exclusive Control of China (Continued)

　　In addition, the United States continuously cultivated He Yingqin of the "Central Government," Bai Chongxi in Central China, Sun Liren in Taiwan, and Ma Hongkui in the Northwest. In particular, it planned to separately supply a large amount of military equipment to Fu Zuoyi, who was entrenched in North China, in order to support him militarily. The Sino-U.S. "cultural exchange" and "goodwill" activities in August 1948. The United States concluded this agreement with the intention of gaining leadership in carrying out enslaving education in China, incidentally using it to cover up its excessively blatant acts of aggression.

　　The Sino-U.S. Naval Agreement, established on December 8, 1947, stipulated:

　　"(1) The United States will help China establish naval institutions, including organization, fleet, naval ports, base schools, etc.; (2) The United States will help China cultivate and train cadres, including control and supervision; (3) China will supply the United States with naval intelligence and report everything." (Note: Qianbao, January 8, 1948.)

　　This was an expansion of the U.S. military presence in China agreement announced in October of the same year.

　　The Bilateral Agreement was signed in Nanjing on July 3, 1948, by Stuart and Wang Shijie on behalf of the U.S.-Chiang government as the price for the $275 million "economic aid" portion of the $400 million U.S. aid to Chiang. It stipulated:

　　1. The United States has the highest supervisory power and decision-making power over U.S. aid funds, materials, and "Chinese currency" equivalent to these funds and materials.

　　2. "The Chinese government will facilitate the transfer to the United States of materials produced in China that the United States needs due to the lack or possible lack of its own resources, whether for storage or other purposes." The Chiang government will also provide the United States with "necessary information" regarding these materials in a timely manner.

　　3. The Chiang government must make every effort to "reduce public and private difficulties in trade with other countries" to facilitate the dumping of goods from the United States and various U.S.-occupied areas into China.

　　4. The Special Representative Office of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration and its staff stationed in China for direct supervision "shall be regarded as part of the Embassy of the United States of America in China, so as to enjoy...privileges and exemptions (Note: i.e., inviolability of person and property, tax exemption, extraterritoriality...etc.)" (Note: Qianbao, July 14, 1948.)

　　The Sino-U.S. Agricultural Agreement was established in Nanjing on August 5, 1948, in the form of an "exchange of letters," stipulating that the U.S. President would appoint two Americans to join the "China Rural Reconstruction Commission" composed of three members of the Chiang government. This committee could "formulate" and "supervise" the implementation of various agricultural plans, encompassing everything from agricultural production, sales, irrigation, animal husbandry to family and village industries, rural education, etc. It could also appoint "executive officials and administrative personnel deemed necessary" and establish "cooperation" methods with "appropriate Chinese government agencies and international or private institutions in China"... In addition, it was also stipulated that 10 percent of the $275 million in "economic assistance" from the United States to the Chiang government would be allocated specifically as the ongoing expenses for U.S. imperialist aggression against Chinese agriculture (Note: Qianbao, August 15, 1948.)

　　Putting these treaties together, the United States obtained from Chiang Kai-shek the rights to Chinese territory, airspace, territorial waters, inland river navigation, railway management, military affairs, finance, police, judiciary, national secrets, agriculture, industry and mining, commerce, customs, culture and education, "final decision-making power" in internal affairs, and command of foreign affairs, etc. Truly, from the heavens to the earth, from the sea to the land, from politics to economics, from material to culture, from the present to the future, everything was included and everything was available. All talk of "Chinese" sovereignty had in fact become American sovereignty.

　　In addition to these, in the past three years, the United States has also supported the resurgence of Japanese militarism in many ways, using it to oppose the Soviet Union; at the same time, it is also using it as a powerful assistant to implement the above-mentioned various steps and plans for aggression against China.

　　Looking at the process of American aggression against China over the past hundred years, it has gone from gradual to tight, from sharing to exclusive control. The power of the Chinese people to resist American aggression has grown from small to large, from scattered to concentrated. Now, it has not only reached the most acute stage of the struggle, but is also approaching the decisive moment of victory and defeat. The Chinese people must unite under the banner of the people's savior Mao Zedong and strive for the victory in the final five minutes. Let American imperialism fall down before the Chinese people, just like the Japanese aggressors who have close historical ties with it.

　　美国侵华史
    刘大年
        四　独占中国（续完）	
    此外，美国对“中央”的何应钦，华中的白崇禧，台湾的孙立人，西北的马鸿逵等也不断培植，特别是对困踞华北的傅作义，还打算单独供给大量军火，从军事上来扶植他，一九四八年八月中美“文化交流”和“亲善”活动。美国订立这个协定用意，是为取得在中国进行奴化教育的领导权。附带借此掩盖它过分露骨的侵略罪行。
    中美海军协定，一九四七年十二月八日成立，规定：
    “（一）由美国帮助中国建立海军机构，包括组织、舰队、军港、基地学校等；（二）由美国帮助中国培养训练干部，包括控制监督；（三）由中国供给美国以海军情报，并报告一切。”（注：民国三十七年一月八日，前报。）
    这是同年十月公布的美军驻华协定的扩大。
    双边协定，一九四八年七月三日由司徒雷登与王世杰代表美蒋政府在南京签订，作为美国援蒋四亿元中二亿七千五百万元“经济援助”部分的代价。规定：
    一，美国援蒋款项、物资、及与这批款项，物资相等的“中国货币”有最高监督权和决定权。
    二，“中国政府对美利坚合众国，因其本国资源中缺乏或可能缺乏而需要之中国所产物资转移于美利坚合众国，无论系为储蓄或其他目的，将予以便利”。蒋政府并按时向美国供给有关这些物资“所必要之情报”。
    三，蒋政府要作一切努力，“减少与他国间贸易之公私困难”。便于美国和各美占领区商品来华倾销。
    四，驻华执行直接监督的美国经济合作局特别代表团及所属职员“须视为美利坚合众国驻中国大使馆之一部分，俾得享受…优例及豁免（按：即身体财产不可侵犯权、免税权、治外法权……等）”（注：民国三十七年七月十四日，前报。）
    中美农业协定，一九四八年八月五日在南京以“换文”方式成立，规定由美国总统委派美国人二名，加入蒋政府三人组成“中国农村复兴委员会”，这个委员会可以“拟订”和“督察”实行各项农业计划，从农业生产、销售、灌溉、畜牧到家庭与乡村工业，农村教育等，无所不包。又可以任命“所认为必要之执行官吏行政人员”，和与“适当的中国政府机构及在中国之国际或私人机构”订立“合作”办法……。另外还规定从美国给蒋政府的二亿七千五百万美元“经济援助”中，再拨出百分之十，专作美帝国主义对中国农业侵略的经常费用（注：民国三十七年八月十五日，前报。）
    把这些条约合在一起，美国从蒋介石手中取得了中国领土权、领空权、领海权、内河航行权、铁路管理权、军权、财权、警察权、司法权、国家秘密权、农业权、工矿权、商业权、海关权、文化教育权、内政“最后决定权”，外交指挥权等等。真是从天上到地下，从海上到陆上，从政治到经济，从物质到文化，从现在到将来，无所不包，应有尽有，所有“中国”主权云云，实际上尽成美国主权了。
    除了这些，三年中，美国又多方面扶植日本军国主义再起，利用它去反对苏联；同时，也是利用它来作为贯彻上述各个侵华步骤与计划的有力助手。
    综观百余年来，美国侵略中国的过程，由渐至紧，由分享至独占，而中国人民反抗美国侵略的力量，则由小到大，由分散到集中，现在不仅达到了斗争最尖锐阶段，且已接近胜负决定关头，中国人民必须团结在人民救星毛泽东的旗帜下，争取最后五分钟的胜利。让美帝国主义同与它有密切历史关系的日本侵略者一样，在中国人民面前倒下去。
