Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 16th. Wireless telegraph communication between Changsha and Hengyang was restored on the 13th. When the White bandits under the command of Bai Chongxi fled, the employees of the Hengyang Telecommunications Bureau opposed the White bandits' conspiracy to relocate and destroy equipment, bravely and resourcefully preserving much important equipment. This is one of the important reasons why the bureau was able to quickly resume work. The day before liberation, the White bandits sent bandit troops to the bureau to threaten employees with dismantling the machines at gunpoint. The employees immediately risked their lives and tried every possible means to hide the equipment. Taking advantage of the opportunity when the bandit troops went out to find a vehicle, telecommunication worker Xiao Wang secretly sent one of the bureau's largest and most efficient receiving machines to the lounge. Then, telegraph operator Yin Bingyi took the opportunity to move the machine back to his home and hide it. The day after the liberation of Hengyang, the machine was returned to the bureau and installed in the telegraph room.

　　电讯局职工奋勇保护器材
  　衡阳长沙恢复通报
    【新华社长沙十六日电】长沙、衡阳间无线电报已于十三日恢复通报。衡阳电讯局职工在白匪崇禧溃逃时，反对白匪的迁移破坏阴谋，英勇机智地保存了许多重要器材。这是该局能迅速恢复工作的重要原因之一。解放的前一天，白匪曾派匪军前往该局持枪威胁职工拆卸机器。职工们当即冒着生命的危险，千方百计地设法隐藏器材。电讯员小王趁着匪军出去找车的机会，偷偷地把该局的一部最大、效率最高的抄报机送入了休息室，又由报务员尹炳一乘机将这部机器搬回自己家里藏起来。衡阳解放的第二天，这部机器就又被送回到该局，在报房里安装起来。
