　　On the Contradiction Between Reason and Emotion
　　Ruoshui
　　“I know all these theories you’re talking about, and I can even explain them better than you, but…”
　　But what? The "often heard phrase" cited by Li Si was not finished; Ruowen continued it: "...but emotionally I can't accept it, I can't change it for a while..." (See "Don't 'But...'" and "'Theoretically Acknowledged, Emotionally Unacceptable'" in the People's Garden on September 30th and October 12th).
　　This indeed reflects a very common problem—especially a common problem existing among "not-yet-reformed intellectuals." Because I myself am no exception, I have thought about this issue a lot. Now I write it down for discussion.
　　Why is this problem particularly prone to happen to us intellectuals? I think it's because: intellectuals have a certain level of education, and most of them are from youth and student backgrounds. Generally speaking, they are more enthusiastic about pursuing the truth and have the ability to learn. In this respect, we have progressive and favorable conditions. However, intellectuals mostly come from non-proletarian classes. Our consciousness, emotions, habits, temperament, character, etc., have grown up in the air and soil of the old environment. The class nature of the non-proletariat is deeply rooted within us. Compared with the proletarian stand, viewpoints, ideology, methods of thinking, style, and qualities required by the revolutionary theories we have read, we are far behind. Therefore, on the other hand, our progress has unfavorable conditions. From here comes the contradiction between us intellectuals in the process of transformation and progress.
　　Since the vast majority of our past history has been under the old environment and old influences, since the old consciousness and old emotions have become a part of our flesh and blood, and the period in which we have come into contact with new ideas and new environments is very short compared to the former, it is by no means an easy task to make new ideas and new emotions take root in our hearts, gain a dominant position, and even completely eliminate the old consciousness and old emotions. In the meantime, we must go through many fierce battles. Often, even if the power of new ideas has broken through the weaker defense line of the old consciousness, the old emotions still remain on their original positions and refuse to surrender. This is the so-called "theoretically acknowledging; emotionally unacceptable."
　　However, the opposite situation also exists. Sometimes one has accepted it emotionally or it has been mobilized, but theoretically it has not been acknowledged or recognized. A cadre who has been infected with hedonistic habits is always driven to degenerate by lust first, and his mind cannot approve of himself and think that doing so is justified. This is an example of regression. An example of progress is that a peasant who has not received the education of the Communist Party may have a deep hatred for the landlord who oppressed him, but he does not have any theoretical understanding of why the landlord class is hateful. He neither understands how feudal relations of production hinder the productive forces nor what class struggle is. His resistance to the landlord has more perceptual elements than rational elements. Although his emotions are strong, they are somewhat narrow and blind, lacking theoretical control and guidance. Another example is in the student movement in the Kuomintang-ruled areas in the past, some students felt very indignant and hated when they saw secret agents running rampant and arresting people, or military police slaughtering students, so they participated in strikes and demonstrations, and also hoped that the Kuomintang government would collapse. However, at that time, they did not fully realize the reactionary essence of the Kuomintang regime, and they lacked a thorough understanding of the true revolutionary significance of the student movement in which they personally participated. Their actions were only based on a spontaneous youthful and simple "sense of justice." Although their enthusiasm was very high, there was no solid theory to support them, so it was very empty, erratic, and easy to get hot and cold. This is a situation where theory does not match emotions and actions.
　　This is the contradiction between reason and emotion, the contradiction between thought and action. It is wrong to deny this contradiction and regard these two as absolutely consistent. If one judges that a person lacks the same degree of emotion and action based on his lack of a certain theory or thought; or conversely, if one infers from the premise that a person has certain emotions and actions that he must also have a thought or theory that is completely in line with it: these are all rigid and mechanical views. Emotions, actions, and thoughts or theories are not always developing in a balanced way; sometimes emotions lag behind thoughts, and sometimes actions precede theory.
　　However, reason and emotion, thought and action are inseparable things; there is a unified connection between them. It is impossible for a person to have realized in his mind the truth of "serving the people wholeheartedly" but in practice "plan for himself wholeheartedly." No matter how little, he will always have some love for the people accompanied by the occurrence, and some actions to serve the people will be expressed accordingly. It is also impossible for a person to hate the Kuomintang reactionaries emotionally and resist them in action, but to think rationally that the Kuomintang reactionaries are completely reasonable and justified. More or less, he will have some ideological understanding when these emotions and actions occur, and his emotions and actions will also promote the deepening of his ideological understanding.
　　If reason takes a step forward, it will generate a force that drives emotion to follow; at the same time, backward emotions will have a reaction to progressive reason, trying to pull reason back. Reason requires emotion to be consistent with itself; emotion requires reason to be consistent with itself. Thus a split occurs. When this split exceeds a certain limit, the personality will completely lose its balance and integrity, and it must seek unity. A cadre who has begun to degenerate but has not completely degenerated will feel the pain of this split. He either uses reason to overcome emotions to resolve the conflict between the two, or looks for some reasons to deceive himself, such as "I have suffered for the revolution for so many years, and now it is a deserved reward to enjoy more," etc., so that reason yields to emotions to ease the contradiction between the two. In the former case, the advancing wins over the retreating, and this is progress. In the latter case, the retreating wins over the advancing, and this is regression.
　　The contradiction between emotion and reason, thought and action constantly occurs, is overcome, then occurs again, and is overcome again, the new negates the old, and the advancing conquers the backward. This is the process of transformation and progress of intellectuals and other people.
　　"Emotionally unacceptable!" This shows that emotion has not obeyed reason and is still holding reason back; this also shows that the mind has not been "cleared," because reason is still burdened by emotion, and it is impossible for it to go very far. If one denies even a little bit of progress in thought simply because emotion and action have not kept up, this is of course inappropriate; but if one thinks that even if emotion and action are backward, thought can move forward separately from them, this is also wrong. Don't mistakenly think that there are no theoretical problems at all and that you can relax, and that the problem is entirely with that damn "emotion." If we can guarantee ourselves 100% humble self-reflection, we will find that this is deceiving ourselves and unconsciously deceiving others.
　　The example cited by Li Si can also illustrate this point: "In theory, in words, I would also say: 'We must unite the masses, learn from the masses, and humbly accept the criticism of the masses.' But, in practice, I feel that some masses are 'too backward' and unity is really 'difficult.' In fact, I have never approached others humbly and enthusiastically. 'To give play to the creativity and enthusiasm of the masses' is just a term in the book. In reality, it is much simpler and more pleasant to take care of everything oneself!" Is this "knowing" or completely "acknowledging" the theory about the mass line? Disliking the masses for being "too backward": this means not acknowledging "learning from the masses"; it means not knowing the necessity of taking care of the majority of intermediate and backward masses; not knowing that helping them overcome backwardness is precisely our job. Feeling "difficult" and unwilling to unite them: this means not acknowledging "uniting the masses"; it means not knowing that "without relying on the consciousness and initiative of the masses, we will accomplish nothing and waste our efforts" (Liu Shaoqi); not knowing that work is only easy after the masses are united and mobilized. Thinking that it is "simple" and "pleasant" to take care of everything oneself: this means not acknowledging "to give play to the creativity and enthusiasm of the masses"; it means not knowing how great the latent power of the masses is; not knowing how detached and incompatible the act of taking over from the masses is with the view that the masses should liberate themselves. In short, this example proves that the so-called "acknowledgment" is only a reluctant and discounted acknowledgment, not a complete and heartfelt acknowledgment; the so-called "knowing" is at most a superficial and abstract understanding, not a real understanding that is linked to practice.
　　Where is the crux of the problem? I might as well try to give an analytical description.
　　The new theory holding the banner of "Marxism-Leninism" attacked the gate of the heart. In the first few rounds, it defeated those old consciousnesses that stood at the forefront, had the most obvious targets, and had the weakest strength. The new theory has come in. The small part of the old consciousness that was defeated surrendered. The truth of the sentence "I theoretically acknowledge" is only this point. In fact, the power of the old consciousness is still strong. They are secretly calling out in your heart: "We don't admit it, we don't admit it!" Although it is difficult for you to hear this voice. Among these old consciousnesses, there are "liberalism," "hedonism," "heroism," "fantasy," "romance"… The ones who were defeated and surrendered were only insignificant pawns and little devils under their command; the monsters that truly controlled your actions and ruling power are them. Their fortresses are built in the deepest layer of your heart. They watched as the army of new theory rushed in step by step, approaching their lair. They were afraid and trembled. They knew that they could not defeat this army of truth, so they changed their strategy, no longer showing themselves, confronting head-on, but adopting the method of hiding and preserving their strength. They played a trick of false peace. When you say "I theoretically acknowledge," you subconsciously accepted their order and sent a false letter of surrender to the new theory. Its substantial meaning is: "We have completely surrendered; please don't fight anymore!" But in fact, they hid in the most secluded and dark corners of your heart, lurking in your subconscious, avoiding being seen by the new theory, while stirring, jumping, and making trouble in your heart, secretly telling you, threatening you: "Don't let him in! Otherwise you will have a hard time!" So you became uneasy, worried, and your old emotions stood up. While covering up the old consciousness monsters, they blocked the army of new theory and shouted: "I can't accept it!"
　　This is the true meaning behind the sentence "theoretically acknowledging; emotionally unacceptable," and this is the whole secret of the matter.
　　A person who truly, completely, and thoroughly acknowledges revolutionary theory will not feel anything that is "emotionally unacceptable." On the contrary, he only feels that his emotions are consistent with his thoughts. The intensity of his emotions increases with the depth of his thought. The person with the highest level of cultivation of revolutionary theory also has the most sincere, strongest, and richest revolutionary feelings.
　　Of course, compared to the situation where one stably stays in the old stage and no contradiction has even occurred, this situation with contradiction is still a step forward. But, this alone is not enough. Thought without emotion cannot be solid and deep; theory without action cannot produce practical effects. Theory becomes action, and thought transforms into emotion, which becomes a "material force," and thought and theory themselves can advance and complete their own development. So what is really important is this second step.
　　And what is really difficult is also this second step. A person with a weak will will make the new theory stand still at this time, so his progress will stagnate. This is a serious stage. Don't fall for the trick of the old consciousness, thinking that they have really completely surrendered and that there are really no enemies in thought. You must know that there are not only enemies in thought, but they are also very powerful. You must also know that the resistance of emotion to reason is essentially a way and manifestation of the resistance of latent old consciousness to new ideas. Push away the "emotion" as a shield, search for the old consciousness hiding behind it, chase and beat it hard, and mercilessly eliminate them, so that the new ideas can seize power (the power to control action) from the hands of the old ideas. Of course, this power cannot be completely seized in one go, and the fortresses of the old consciousness cannot be completely occupied all at once. There will still be repeated contention, and there will still be continuous wars. One victory after another, accumulated together, can become a complete victory. This will be a long-term struggle, but it must not be used as an excuse to slack off and postpone or suspend the attack and victory of new ideas. On the contrary, we must intensify this internal struggle and shorten the time for new ideas to achieve victory. This is a spiritual revolution, and like the actual revolution, it must be carried out to the end. We must overthrow the tyrannical old consciousness monster that rules you and overthrow that "petty-bourgeois kingdom in the depths of the soul." Only in this way can one obtain a transformation that is reborn.

　　试论理智与感情的矛盾
    若水
   “你说的这些理论，我都知道，甚至还能比你讲得更好，只是……”
    只是什么呢？李思所引的这句“常常可以听到的话”，并没有说完；若文却把它接下去说出来了：“……只是感情上接受不了，一时改不过来，……”（见九月三十日和十月十二日的人民园地上“不要‘只是……’”与“‘理论上承认，感情上接受不了’”两篇文章）。
    这的确反映出一个很普遍的问题——特别是存在于“没改造好的知识分子”中的普遍问题。因为自己也不例外，所以对于这个问题曾有过一番思索。现在把它写出来和大家讨论。
    为什么这问题特别容易发生在我们知识分子身上？我想，因为：知识分子有一定的文化水平，又多是青年学生出身，一般说来比较富于追求真理的热忱和学习的能力，因而我们对书本上的理论了解得快，接受得也容易。在这一方面，我们具有进步的有利条件。然而知识分子又大半出身于非无产阶级。我们的意识、感情、习惯、气质、性格等是在旧环境的空气和土壤中长成的。非无产阶级的阶级性是根深蒂固地在我们内部存在着。比起我们所读到的革命理论所要求的那种无产阶级的立场、观点、思想方法和作风、品质来，我们是落后得太远了。因此，在另一方面我们的进步又有着不利的条件。从这里便产生了我们知识分子在改造和进步过程中的矛盾。
    既然我们过去历史的绝大半时期是在旧环境旧影响之下，既然旧意识和旧感情已成了我们血肉的一部分，而我们接触到新思想，新环境的时期比较起前者来又非常短暂，要使新思想新感情在我们心里生根，取得统治地位，以至完全消灭旧意识旧感情，决不是一件轻易的事。其间必得经过许多次激烈的战斗。往往，即使新思想的力量已突破了旧意识的较薄弱的防线，旧感情还仍然守在原来的阵地上不肯屈服。这就是所谓“理论上承认；感情上接受不了。”
    但，相反的情形也是有的。有时是感情上已经接受了，或发动了，理论上却还没有承认，或还没有认识。一个沾染上了享乐风习的干部，总是情欲先驱使他堕落，而思想上还并不就能批准自己，认为这样做是心安理得的。这是一个退步的例子。进步的例子如一个没有受过共产党的教育的农民，对于压迫他的地主可能有很深的仇恨，但他对地主阶级为什么可恨，却并没有什么理论上的认识。他既不懂得封建的生产关系如何阻碍了生产力，也不懂得什么叫阶级斗争。他对地主的反抗，感性成分多于理性成分。他的感情虽然强烈，却多少带着狭隘性和盲目性，缺乏理论的驾驭和指导。又如以前国民党统治区学生运动中，有一部分学生因为看到特务横行捕人，或军警屠杀同学，感到非常义愤和痛恨，于是才去参加罢课游行，并且也希望国民党政府垮台。但他们在当时却还没有十分认识到国民党政权的反动本质，对自己亲身参加的学生运动的真正革命意义，也缺乏透澈的了解。他们的行动，只是基于一种自发的青年的单纯“正义感”罢了。他们的热情虽然很高，却没有坚实的理论在背后支持，因而也就很虚泛，飘忽，容易热也容易冷。这是理论配合不上感情与行动。
    这就是理智与感情的矛盾，思想与行动的矛盾。否认这种矛盾，把这两者看作是绝对一致的东西，是错误的。如果以一个人的缺乏某种理论或思想为根据，而判定他也同样程度地缺乏那种感情与行动；或者相反，从一个人具有某些感情与行动的前提，推断出他一定也具有完全与之相合的思想或理论的结论：这都是生硬的机械的看法。感情、行动与思想或理论并不常是平衡发展的；有时感情会掉在思想后头，有时行动会走在理论前面。
    然而理智与感情，思想与行动又是不能分割的东西；它们之间存在着统一的连系，一个人不可能在思想上已经认识到“全心全意为人民服务”的真理了，而在实际行动上却是“一心一意为自己打算”。不论多少，他总有些爱人民的情感相伴发生，总有些为人民服务的行动随着表现。一个人也不可能在感情上痛恨国民党反动派了，在行动上反抗它了，而在理智上却认为国民党反动派完全合理正当。或多或少，他在发生这种感情和行动的时候总有些思想上的认识，并且他的感情和行动也促使他的思想认识加深。
    假若是理智跨前了一步，它就产生一种带动感情跟随前进的力量；而同时，落后的感情对进步的理智又发生一种反动，要把理智拉回来。理智要求感情与自己一致；感情要求理智与自己一致。这样就发生了分裂。这种分裂超过一定限度，人格就要完全失去均衡和完整，就一定要求得统一。一个开始堕落而还没有完全堕落的干部是会感到这种分裂的痛苦的。他或者用理智战胜情感，以解决两者之间的冲突，或者寻找些理由来欺骗自己，如“干革命苦了多少年，现在多享受些是应该得到的报酬”等等，使理智向情感让步，以缓和两者之间的矛盾。在前一种情形，前进的对后退的取得了胜利，这就是进步。在后一种情形，后退的对前进的取得了胜利，这就是倒退。
    感情与理智、思想与行动的矛盾不断发生，克服，再发生，再克服，新的否定旧的，前进的征服落后的，这就是知识分子和其他人们的改造与进步过程。
    “感情上接受不了！”这就表示，感情还没有服从理智，还在拖住理智的脚；这也就表示，思想还没有搞“通”，因为理智还在受感情的累，他不可能走得很前。如果因为感情上行动上还没有跟上来，就连思想上的一点进步成份也一概否认掉，这固然不妥当；但如果以为感情上行动上纵然落后，思想却可脱离他们单独前进，这也是错误。不要误以为理论上已完全没有问题了，可以放松了，问题完全在该死的“感情”。如果我们能保证自己百分之百的虚心反省，便将发觉这是欺骗了自己，也不自觉地欺骗了旁人。
    试就李思所举的例子，也可说明这点了：“在理论上，在口头上，我也会说：‘我们要团结群众，向群众学习，谦虚地接受群众的批评。’但，一到实践，就觉得有些群众‘太落后’了，团结实在‘困难’呢。其实，自己就不曾虚心热忱地去接近别人。‘要发挥群众的创造性与积极性’，更只是书本子上的名词，实际上，凡事一手包办，简便，痛快得多！”这是不是对关于群众路线的理论“都知识”或完全“承认”了呢？嫌群众“太落后”：这就是不承认“向群众学习”；就是不知道照顾多数中间与落后的群众的必要；不知道帮助他们克服落后，正就是我们的工作。感到“困难”而不愿团结他们：这就是不承认“团结群众”；就是不知道“不依靠群众的自觉与自动，我们将一事无成，费力不讨好。”（刘少奇）；不知道只有群众团结起来，发动起来后，工作才是容易的。认为自己一手包办“简便”“痛快”：这就是不承认“要发挥群众的创造性与积极性”；就是不知道群众的潜伏力量是如何伟大；不知道代替包办是如何地脱离了群众，如何与群众自己解放自己的观点不相容。——总之，这个例子证明：所谓“承认”，只是勉强的，打过折扣的承认，并不是完全的，心悦诚服的承认；所谓“知道”，也至多是表面的，抽象的了解，并不是与实际联系的真正的懂得。
    问题症结在哪里？我不妨试作一个分析的描述。
    举着“马列主义”的旗帜的新的理论攻到了心的大门。在最初几个回合上，他把那些站在最前线的，目标最明显，而力量最薄弱的旧意识打垮了。新理论攻进来了。那战败的一小部旧意识投降了。“我理论上承认”，这句话的真实性就只这一点。实则旧意识的势力还强大着呢。他们正在你心中暗叫：“我们不承认，不承认！”虽然这声音你很难听见。这些旧意识中，有“自由主义”，有“享乐思想”，有“英雄主义”，有“幻想”，有“浪漫”………战败投降的只是在他们部下的不足轻重的喽罗小鬼；真正操纵着你的行动统治权的妖怪是他们。他们的堡垒建筑在你心中最深的底层。他们眼看新理论的大军一步步冲进来，快临近他们的＠穴了。他们害怕了，发抖了。他们自己知道战不过这支真理的军队，于是改换战略，不再显露自己，正面决战，而采取隐蔽躲藏，保存实力的办法。他们玩了一套假和平的阴谋。当你说“我理论上承认”时，就是下意识地接受了他们的命令，向新理论投出假求和书。它的意思实质就是：“我们已经完全投降了；请不要打了！”而其实，他们一面躲藏在你心中最幽隐暗黑的角落里，潜伏在你的下意识里，避免给新理论看见，一面在你心中骚动，跳踉，捣乱，暗暗吩咐你，威胁你：“不许让他进来！否则你有苦头吃！”于是你不安了，担忧了，你的旧感情站出来了。他一面遮住旧意识的妖怪，一面拦住新理论的大军，嚷道：“我接受不了！”
    这就是“理论上承认；感情上接受不了”这句话背后的真实意义，这也就是事情的全部秘密。
    在一个真正地，完全地，彻底地承认了革命理论的人，是不会觉到什么“情感上接受不了”的。相反，他只觉得他的情感与思想一致。他的情感强度随他的思想深度增加而增加。革命理论的修养最高的人，革命的感情也最真挚，最强烈，最丰富。
    当然，比起那安定地停留在旧阶段上，连矛盾都还没有发生的情形来，这种有了矛盾的情形还算是进了一步的。但，只有这点，是不够得很的。思想没有感情，就不能坚实，深固；理论没有行动，就不能产生实际的效果。理论变成行动，思想化为感情，这才成为一种“物质的力量”，而且思想理论本身也才能前进，完成它自己的发展。所以真正重要的是在这第二步。
    而真正困难的也在这第二步。意志软弱的人到这时便会使新理论按兵不动，这样他的进步就停滞下来。这是一个严重的阶段。不要中了旧意识的诡计，以为他们真的完全投降了，思想上的敌人真的没有了。要知道思想上的敌人不但有，而且还很强大。也要知道感情对理智的抗拒实质上是潜伏的旧意识对新思想的一种反抗方式和表现。要推开“感情”这块挡箭牌，搜索躲在后面的旧意识，紧追紧打，无情地消灭他们，让新思想从旧思想的手中把政权（行动支配权）夺过来。当然，这政权也不是一次就能全部夺过来的，旧意识的堡垒也不是一下就能全部攻占的。还将有反复的争夺，还将有接连的战争。一个胜利接连一个胜利，积聚起来才能成为完全的胜利。这将是一个长期的斗争，但却决不可用这为借口而自流松懈，延缓或中止新思想的进攻与胜利。相反，要使这内部的斗争加紧地进行，缩短新思想获得胜利的时间。这是一个精神的革命，也要和实际的革命一样，必须进行到底。要打倒那统治你的专横的旧意识妖怪，推翻那个“灵魂深处的小资产阶级王国”。只有这样，自己才能获到脱胎换骨的改造。
