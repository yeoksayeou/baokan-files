　　[This newspaper reports] Shanghai has seen increasingly active material exchange in the past two months, with large quantities of new rice entering the market. Grain sources are abundant. In addition to the surge in market arrivals, state-owned enterprises have also made large purchases in Shanghai. Grain reserves are gradually being replenished. During the period from October 1st to 13th, the Grain Company received a total of 19,116,400 catties of rice shipped from Central China, Northeast China, southern Anhui and other trading companies, as well as rice allocated by the Grain Bureau. The company also has a large supply of flour on the market. On the 13th, the Shanghai market experienced slight fluctuations. In order to prevent profiteers from driving up prices, the company sold 18,529 shi of edible rice on the north and south markets on the 14th alone, accounting for two-thirds of the city's total transaction volume, recovering 448,893,190 yuan in Renminbi. In the flour market, 16,090 bags of flour were sold, recovering 143,566,500 yuan in Renminbi. In the coarse grain market, 6,710 dan of Dalian soybeans were sold, recovering 110,715,000 yuan in Renminbi. In total, the company sold goods worth 703,212,590 yuan in Renminbi, ultimately maintaining the stability of market supply and demand, leaving no room for profiteers to exploit. The Grain Company is also continuously shipping large quantities of flour north to supply Tianjin. Currently, 100,000 bags have arrived in Tianjin, of which 80,000 bags have been handed over to the North China Grain Company for sale, and 20,000 bags have been handed over to the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative. Another 100,000 bags are expected to arrive in Tianjin around the 20th of this month.
