Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 28th—Since crossing the Yangtze River southward, the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army have received more than 50,000 letters of condolence from people all over the country. These letters reflect the infinite love and gratitude of the broad masses of the people in the rear for the People's Liberation Army. The letters universally express the desire to assist the army in continuing to advance, eliminating the remaining enemies, and liberating all of China by stepping up production and construction, giving preferential treatment to military families, and supporting the front lines. The letters of condolence have traveled thousands of miles from Inner Mongolia and the Northeast Liberated Areas, as well as from the North China, Central China, and East China Liberated Areas, and major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. The letter writers include workers, farmers, women, teachers, students, and the broad masses of people from all walks of life. The letters are written in Chinese, Manchu, Mongolian, and even Braille by blind people. All the female workers of the Tianjin Yuanxing Carpet Factory said in their letter of condolence: "For every foot the army advances, we will increase carpet production by one foot." Wang Zhenshan, a military dependent from Hetan Village, Pi County, Shandong, wrote: "Don't worry about your families at the front. Our rear is well-organized. The People's Government provides us with grain, distributes land to us, and also cultivates, plants, hoes, and harvests for us. You can rest assured and fight resolutely to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek!" In its letter of condolence, the Inner Mongolia Democratic Women's Federation, in addition to praising the People's Liberation Army for enabling the Mongolian people, who have been subjected to the persecution of imperialism and the Han chauvinism of the Kuomintang bandits, to stand up, also expressed that they would "make a hundred times more effort and support the national liberation war as much as possible." Li Suzhen, a blind girl from the Nanjing School for the Blind and Deaf, used the unique Braille script to praise and comfort the People's Liberation Army. The East China Military Region and the Third Field Army Headquarters have forwarded these precious letters from the broad masses of the people to the front-line units that are currently fighting, encouraging the entire army to work hard to annihilate the enemy, repay the deep affection of the people, and issue a public letter of thanks to the people of all regions and all walks of life across the country, expressing their firm commitment to carry out the orders of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, thoroughly eliminate the remaining enemies along the coast of East China, advance rapidly to Taiwan, and cooperate with the fraternal field armies and local people's guerrillas across the country to liberate all of China.
