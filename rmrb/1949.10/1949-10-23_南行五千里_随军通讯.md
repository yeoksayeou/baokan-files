	Traveling Five Thousand Li Southward: Dispatches with the Army
		Special Correspondent Zhan Chao

	Accepting the glorious task of accompanying the army to liberate South and Southwest China, we bid farewell to Beijing, the people's capital, with excitement, and advanced along the four major railway lines of Jinpu, Huning, Huhangyong, and Zhegan. Upon arriving at the first destination, Nanchang, the main force was advancing south, so we rushed to Ji'an and, starting from Ji'an, began to catch up with the troops.

	This journey was a total of five thousand three hundred li. If we were traveling in Europe, it would be equivalent to crossing thirty Luxembourgs, six Belgiums, and two and a half Frances. However, if you look at a map of our country, it is just a small section of the road. How vast and expansive is our lovely motherland!

	During my five-thousand-li journey, I found some historical traces of the New China. I am excited, but also deeply aware of the clumsiness of my writing, unable to record even a fraction of the impressions of this great era!

	I. General Ye Ting's Poem

	As I hurried through the triangular area of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, which had been liberated not long ago and was gradually recovering under the people's own government, I remembered a poem: "A beauty in the mist, mountains in the snow, reining in the horse on the cliff, looking ahead. The layered peaks rise straight up three thousand feet, when will the dragon return from the gorge?"

	This was a poem jointly written by the late General Ye Ting and Comrade Qian Junrui when the New Fourth Army, the predecessor of our People's Liberation Army's Third Field Army, reluctantly retreated north through Huangshan during the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, the Kuomintang bandit gang was retreating in defeat, allowing the rich Jiangnan to fall into the hands of Japanese imperialism. Our heroic People's Liberation Army penetrated deep behind enemy lines, directly threatening the heartland of Japanese bandits in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, greatly boosting the morale of the people of Jiangnan. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which harmed the people, originally wanted to use the hands of Japanese imperialism to eliminate the New Fourth Army. However, this people's armed force was not only not eliminated but also grew stronger day by day. Therefore, the Chiang bandits, under the guise of "military orders" and "political orders," forced the New Fourth Army to retreat north. In order to safeguard the overall situation, the Chinese Communist Party reluctantly allowed this people's armed force to temporarily withdraw from Jiangnan. The Chiang bandits then colluded with Japanese imperialism during our army's retreat north, creating the "Maolin Massacre" that shocked the whole country, a historical fact known to all at home and abroad.

	Despite this, the people of Jiangnan were not deterred by the reactionaries. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they persisted in their struggle. Finally, they cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to defeat Japanese imperialism and, in the end, uprooted the Chiang family dynasty, the cornerstone of imperialist aggression against China. Today, Jiangnan is liberated, and Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou are liberated. Let us add a footnote to the end of General Ye Ting's poem:

	"The dragon has returned from the gorge today."

	II. Comrade Fang Zhimin's Two and a Half Guns

	Traveling west along the Zhegan Road, we arrived at Yiyang County in Jiangxi Province, the hometown of revolutionary martyr Comrade Fang Zhimin. His family lived in Qigong Town, northeast of the county seat. Comrade Fang Zhimin was sacrificed under the butcher knife of the Chiang bandits in 1935. Only his elderly mother, wife, children, and other six family members were left behind, living in a small thatched house, relying on the martyr's eldest son, Fang Rongsong, to earn a living by chopping firewood. When the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River to the south, liberating Yiyang and the vast areas of Zhejiang and Jiangxi, their fifteen years of hellish life finally came to an end.

	Unfortunately, the car kept moving, and we were in a hurry to catch up with the troops, so we didn't have time to visit the martyr's former residence. According to Comrades Zhao Ying and Feng Jian of the Jiangxi Daily, Comrade Fang Zhimin's home had been burned thirteen times by the Kuomintang bandit gang. Whenever the Minzhegan People's Guerrilla was dispatched, the families of the martyrs were imprisoned, intimidated, and tortured.

	"Speaking of these fifteen years of hellish life, I am filled with indignation!" Comrade Fang Rongsong said, "Now our own troops have returned! This time, I want to settle accounts with the Kuomintang bandits! We want to organize ourselves and help the troops fight to Guangdong and Taiwan! Avenge my father! Avenge all the people of Jiangxi and China!"

	Few people in northeastern Jiangxi do not know that Comrade Fang Zhimin relied on two and a half guns to conquer the world. In the spring of 1927, after Comrade Fang Zhimin was "politely sent" out of Nanchang by the Jiangxi "Provincial Government" that had betrayed the revolution, he accepted the task given by the Party: to return to Qigong Town to restore the farmers' association and lead the farmers' struggle. At that time, Comrade Shao Shiping, now Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, and Comrade Fang Zhichun, Vice Chairman, also participated in the leadership. Initially, they had only three guns, one of which was broken, hence the name "two and a half guns." Based on this, they gradually established a farmers' guerrilla, using spears, harpoons, and shotguns to fight the enemy, strengthening themselves. They gradually established the Gan Northeast Provincial Soviet Government and the Red Army Tenth Army. In 1934, Comrade Zhimin led the "Anti-Japanese Vanguard" north, and was "encircled and suppressed" by the Kuomintang bandit gang with seven times the force. Comrade Zhimin was unfortunately captured on April 24, 1935, during a breakout, and died heroically in July. Before his death, he still shouted slogans such as "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "The Chinese Communist Party will surely succeed!" and "The Chinese revolution must be victorious!"

	Let the Chiang bandits who still remain on the land of the motherland remember: one Fang Zhimin is dead, but millions of Fang Zhimins have stood up. Let you and your masters, the imperialists, die in the victory of the people.

	III. Victory Talks About "August 1st" City

	Nanchang—This is a famous historical city. It is the birthplace of our Chinese People's Liberation Army.

	Twenty-two years ago, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, General He Long, and the late General Ye Ting held the famous "August 1st" Uprising here. A comrade who was then a battalion commander under Commander-in-Chief Zhu told me: Commander-in-Chief Zhu and General He Long were then army commanders, and General Ye Ting was a division commander. On the morning of August 1, 1927, Zhang Fakui attempted to pull the troops north at Mahuiling Station, a hundred or so li north of Nanchang, and head to Jiujiang to surrender to Chiang Kai-shek's Nanjing counter-revolutionary government. General Ye Ting led the troops south to join forces with Commander-in-Chief Zhu and General He Long, first occupying Niuhang Station, which faced Nanchang across the river to the north, and then entering Nanchang, defeating Zhu Peide's reactionary armed forces. The next day, they went straight to Fuzhou (Linchuan) in southeastern Jiangxi, seized Changting in Fujian, and roamed the vast rural areas of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. Finally, they joined forces with the troops led by Chairman Mao on Jinggang Mountain, laying the foundation for today's powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army.

	Nanchang City, which had written a glorious page in the history of the Chinese revolutionary movement, was declared liberated in May of this year. The people here immediately changed the road named after "Zhongzheng," a signboard full of blood and filth, to "Victory Road." The bridge across the Gan River north of the road was renamed "August 1st Bridge," and the lakeside park opposite Baihuazhou was called "August 1st Park."

	In today's Nanchang, the Pavilion of Prince Teng, famous for the beautiful line "The sunset glow and the lonely wild duck fly together, the autumn water and the sky are the same color," is gone. The Zhongshan Hall in Yuzhang Park, where Comrade Fang Zhimin angrily denounced the Chiang family bandits before his heroic death in July 1935, still exists. "The fascist Kuomintang is using various shameful means of coercion and inducement, attempting to persuade us to surrender," Comrade Fang Zhimin said. "What is your Kuomintang—a gang of vicious robbers! A gang of shameless traitors! A gang of executioners who massacre workers and peasants! We and your counter-revolutionary Kuomintang are irreconcilable. Your fascist bandits can only cut off our heads, but they can never shake our beliefs! Our beliefs are as hard as iron!" His righteousness was awe-inspiring, shining with the sun and the moon for eternity. This revolutionary giant, even in the face of death, still said such things: "We are Communist Party members, we die for the revolution, we have no complaints, and we have nothing to fear. There are only two things that make me uneasy! We have made some mistakes, but once the Party pointed them out, we immediately corrected them. We have always been supporters of the Party's correct line (referring to the line represented by Chairman Mao) and sincere believers in Marx and Lenin." "We firmly believe that under the leadership of the International (referring to the past Third International) and the Central Committee of Leninists, the Chinese revolution and the world revolution will be fully successful in the near future!" (See Comrade Zhimin's will written on June 29, 1935, in the prison cell of the reactionary Nanchang Military Law Department). It is full of infinite loyalty and responsibility to the cause of people's liberation, and overflowing with the great spirit and optimism of a revolutionary. Our martyr wrote in the same will that he was preparing to break out of prison, "if it fails, I will resolutely die!" At this moment, he had only one hope: "Strive to bring millions of oppressed workers, peasants, and soldiers to the banner of the Party, and quickly realize the slogan put forward by the Party to 'create a million powerful Red Army.'" Finally, destroy the bloody rule of the Kuomintang fascists and achieve the establishment of an independent and free New China.

	Today, we can comfort our martyrs. Our Party, and all the people of China, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, have established a regular army of millions that is invincible in the world, and have begun to build a free, independent, unified, prosperous, and strong People's Republic of China. May you rest in peace!

	On this year's "August 1st," the people of Nanchang held a meaningful commemorative meeting. The families of the revolutionary martyrs were mostly invited to toast the victory of the liberation cause won by their relatives with blood and flesh. Fang Zhimin's mother, Old Mrs. Fang, who was 73 years old, was helped into the venue. Shao Shiping, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, and Chen Zhengren, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, immediately stepped forward to greet her, "I am Shiping, do you still recognize me?" Old Mrs. Fang was so excited that her voice trembled a little, "I didn't expect I could live to see you!" Accompanying the martyrs' families were also Mr. Rao Sicheng, the father of Comrade Rao Shushi, Political Commissar of the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, and Li Changxian, a close comrade-in-arms of Comrade Fang Zhimin. Old Mr. Rao excitedly raised his glass and said, "Today we have escaped the darkness and seen the light, and we are very happy in our hearts." He encouraged all the martyrs' families to "play a model role in the construction of the new Jiangxi of the people and the new Nanchang of the people, and in production and all aspects of work, and always maintain our glorious title!"

	IV. A Building Where Chairman Mao Lived

	One night, we arrived in Ji'an, the fourth largest city in Jiangxi. This is the hometown of Wen Tianxiang and Ouyang Xiu. In the moonlight, someone pointed out to me the "Egret Island" in the middle of the Gan River where Wang Yangming once lectured. We stayed in a building of the "Ji'an Daily." Nineteen years ago, Chairman Mao had lived there for forty-nine days. It was not until we moved to the front-line political department the next day that Comrade Wen De told us about it, and we were very excited. According to a Young Pioneer at that time, probably in August of the lunar calendar in 1930, a unit of the Red Army led by Chairman Mao captured the city of Ji'an and did not withdraw to Donggu Mountain on the east side of the Gan River until October. Later, the Central Soviet Area was established in Ruijin area in southeastern Jiangxi. He said that Chairman Mao often held meetings in that building at that time.

	The name of Chairman Mao has a very deep impression in the minds of the people in this area. When talking with the villagers, you can often hear people affectionately calling "Mao Zedong!" As if telling the whereabouts of their own family members, saying when he passed by here, where he lived, and even what he said.

	When I was walking on the vast land of the motherland, I could see everywhere how our people were embracing their leader—our beloved Chairman Mao—with deep affection.

　　南行五千里　随军通讯
    本报特约记者展潮
    接受了随军解放华南与西南的光荣任务，我们怀着兴奋的心情，告别了人民的首都北京，沿着津浦、沪宁、沪杭甬、浙赣四大铁路线前进。到了第一个目的地南昌，大军正南进，我们便赶到吉安，以吉安为起点，开始追赶队伍。
    这段行程一共是五千三百里。如果在欧洲走，等于横跨三十个卢森堡，六个比利时，两个半法国。可是翻开我国地图一看，却只是小小的一段路。我们可爱的祖国是多么辽阔广大啊！
    我在五千里的行程中，寻找到一些新中国的历史踪迹。我兴奋，同时也深感自己文笔的笨拙，记不下这伟大时代印象的万一！
    一、叶挺将军的诗
    当我从宁、沪、杭这块解放不久，在人民自己政权下逐渐苏息过来的三角地带，匆匆地走过的时候，我记起了一道诗：“雾里美人雪里山，凭崖勒马往前看。层峰直上三千丈，出峡蛟龙几时还。”
    这是抗日战争期间，我们人民解放军第三野战军前身的新四军，忍痛北撤路过黄山时，故叶挺将军和钱俊瑞同志共同题的一首诗。当时国民党匪帮节节败退，坐让富饶的江南沦于日本帝国主义手中。我们英勇的人民解放军深入敌后，直逼沪宁杭日寇心腹地带，大大地振奋了江南人民。而残民成性的蒋介石匪帮，原想借日本帝国主义之手，消灭新四军，岂料这支人民武装不仅没有被消灭，而且日益壮大了。于是蒋匪便假借“军令”“政令”，强迫新四军北撤。中国共产党为了顾全大局，忍痛使这一支人民武装暂时退出江南。蒋匪则在我军北撤途中，与日本帝国主义互相策应，制造了震动全国的“茂林惨案”，这是中外皆知的史实。
    虽然如此，江南人民并没有被反动派吓退。他们在中国共产党领导之下，一直坚持斗争。终于配合解放军把日本帝国主义打倒，最后并把帝国主义侵略中国的基石蒋家朝廷，也连根拔掉了。今日江南解放了，沪宁杭解放了。让我们在叶挺将军的诗末加上一个注脚：
    “出峡蛟龙今日还”。
    二、方志敏同志两支半枪
    沿浙赣路西行，到江西省的弋阳县，这里是革命烈士方志敏同志的故乡，他家住在县城东北的漆工镇。方志敏同志在一九三五年牺牲于蒋匪屠刀之下，家中只留下年迈的老母、妻子、儿女等六人，挤在一个小茅房里，靠烈士长子方荣松打柴度日。人民解放大军南渡长江，解放了弋阳以及浙、赣等广大地区，他们十五年来的地狱生活，才最后宣告结束。
    可惜的是，车子不停息地行进，我们急着要赶队伍，没有来得及拜望烈士的故居。据江西日报赵楹、冯健同志谈：方志敏同志家里先后被国民党匪帮烧过十三次，每当闽浙赣人民游击队出动，烈士们的家属便被监禁起来，恫吓、拷打。
    “提起这十五年的地狱生活，我愤慨万分！”方荣松同志说：“现在自己的队伍又回来了！这回我要向国民党匪徒们清算，我们要组织起来，帮助队伍打到广东、台湾去！为父亲报仇！为全江西，全中国人民复仇！”
    赣东北的人，很少不知道方志敏同志是靠两支半枪打天下的。一九二七年春天，方志敏同志被叛变革命的江西“省政府”“礼送”出南昌后，便接受党给予的任务：回到漆工镇去恢复农民协会，领导农民斗争。当时参加领导的，还有现在江西省人民政府主席邵式平，副主席方志纯同志。起初他们只有三支枪，一枝坏的，故称“两支半枪”。以这为基础，逐渐成立了农民游击队，用戈矛、梭标、土枪与敌人搏门，壮大了自己。逐渐建立了赣东北省苏维埃政府和红军第十军团。到一九三四年，志敏同志率领“抗日先遣队”北上，途中被国民党匪帮以七倍于己的兵力“围剿”，志敏同志于一九三五年四月二十四日突围时不幸被俘，七月慷慨就义，临死时，犹高呼“中国共产党万岁！”“中国共产党一定成功！”“中国革命一定要胜利！”的口号。
    于今还残留在祖国土地上的蒋匪们记着：一个方志敏死了，千百万个方志敏已经站立起来了，让你们和你们的主子帝国主义者，在人民的胜利声中死亡吧。
    三、胜利话“八一”城
    南昌—这是一座历史的名城。她是我们中国人民解放军的诞生地。
    二十二年前，朱总司令、贺龙将军和故叶挺将军，在这里举行了有名的“八一”起义。一位当时在朱总司令部下当营长的同志告诉我：朱总司令和贺龙将军那时任军长，叶挺将军任师长。一九二七年八月一日早晨，张发奎在南昌以北百十里的马回岭车站，企图把队伍往北拉，开向九江去投蒋介石南京反革命政府，叶挺将军则把队伍向南带，和朱总司令、贺龙将军会师，先攻占北面与南昌隔江相对的牛行车站，再进入南昌，把朱培德的反动武装打得稀哩哗啦。次日，直下赣东南的抚州（临川），进取福建长汀，纵横于闽粤赣广大农村，最后，在井岗山上和毛主席率领的队伍会师，从此，奠定了今日强大无比的中国人民解放军的根基。
    在中国革命运动史上曾经写下光辉的一页底南昌城，于今年五月宣告解放。这里的人民立即把那条以充满血腥气、龌龊万端的招牌——“中正”为名的大路，改为“胜利路”。把路北那座横跨在赣江上的大桥，改称“八一大桥”，把百花洲对面那座湖滨公园，称作“八一公园”。
    在今日的南昌，以“落霞与孤鹜齐飞，秋水共长天一色”的佳句而出名的滕王阁已经没有了。方志敏同志在一九三五年七月壮烈就义前，怒斥蒋家匪徒的豫章公园中山堂依然存在。“法西斯国民党在用种种威迫利诱的可耻手段，企图劝诱我们投降。”方志敏同志说：“你国民党是什么东西——一伙凶恶的强盗！一伙无耻的卖国汉奸！一伙屠杀工农的刽子手！我们与你们反革命国民党是势不两立的，你法西斯匪徒们只能砍下我们的头颅，决不能丝毫动摇我们的信仰！我们的信仰是铁一般地坚硬的！”大义凛然，与日月同辉万世。这位革命的巨人，即使在死的面前，也还说这样的话：“我们是共产党员，为革命而死，毫无所怨，更无所惧，只有两件事使我不能释怀！作过某些错误，但经党指出，莫不立刻纠正，我们始终是党的正确路线（按指以毛主席为代表的路线）的拥护者，是马克思、列宁竭诚的信仰者。”“我们坚决相信在国际（按指过去的第三国际）和中央列宁主义的领导之下，中国革命和世界革命必能在不远的将来得到全部成功！”（见志敏同志一九三五年六月二十九日写于反动派南昌军法处囚室中的遗嘱）充满着对人民解放事业无限的忠诚与责任感，洋溢着革命者的伟大气魄与乐观精神。我们的烈士在同一遗嘱中写道，他准备越狱，“不能成功则坚决就死”！在这个时刻，他只有一个希望：“争取千万被压迫的工农士兵群众到党的旗帜下来，很快实现党所提出‘创造一百万强大的红军’的口号”。最后，冲毁国民党法西斯的血腥统治，达到独立自由的新中国底建立。
    今天可以告慰我们的烈士了。我们党，我们全中国的人民，已经在自己伟大的领袖毛主席领导之下，建立起了数百万无敌于天下的正规军，并且开始建设着自由、独立、统一、富强的中华人民共和国，愿您安息！
    在今年“八一”，南昌人民曾经举行一个有意义的纪念会，革命先烈们的家属多被请来，为自己亲人以血肉争取来的解放事业底胜利而干杯。方志敏烈士七十三岁高龄的母亲方老太太被扶进会场，江西省人民政府主席邵式平，中国共产党江西省委书记陈正人同志，立即趋前问候，“我就是式平，您还认得吗？”方老太太兴奋得声音都有点颤抖地说：“没想到我能活下来见到你们！”与烈士家属同行的，还有人民解放军第三野战军政治委员饶漱石同志的父亲饶思诚老先生，方志敏同志的亲密战友李长先等人。饶老先生兴奋地举着酒杯说：“今天我们已摆脱了黑暗，见到了光明，内心非常高兴。”他与全体烈军属互勉道：“我们要在建设人民的新江西，人民的新南昌中，在生产以及各方面的工作上，起模范作用，永远保持我们的光荣称号！”
    四、毛主席住过的一座楼
    一个夜晚，我们来到了江西的第四大城——吉安。这是文天祥、欧阳修的家乡。在月光下面，有人指点我看见赣江中间王阳明曾经讲过学的“白鹭洲”。我们在“吉安日报”一座楼上借住，十九年前，毛主席曾在上面住过四十九天。第二天搬往前线政治部时，才听文德同时讲起，兴奋万分。据一位那时的少年先锋队员说：大概一九三○年阴历八月，毛主席带领的一部红军，攻占了吉安城，到十月才撤到赣江东边的东鼓山。后来在赣东南瑞金一带，建立了中央苏区。他说毛主席当时常在那座楼上开会。
    毛主席的名字在这一带人民的脑海里，有极深刻的印象，和老乡们谈话时，你时常可以听到人们亲昵地称呼着“毛泽东！”象诉说自己家人的行踪似地，说他什么时候打这里走过，在那里住过甚至讲过什么话。
    我在祖国广阔的大地上走动着的时候，到处可看得到，我国人民是如何地用深挚的感情，来拥抱着自己的领袖——我们亲爱的毛主席。
    一九四九年秋向广东进军中途
