　　Northern Guangdong People Bring Food and Drink
    To Welcome the Southward Marching Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, Guangdong Front, 9th] A front-line reporter reports that the grand occasion of the people of Northern Guangdong welcoming the People's Liberation Army can be described as follows: After crossing the Dayu Ridge of the Five Ridges, you arrive in Guangdong. The People's Liberation Army advances along the highway, singing songs without end. The people south of Dayu Ridge, together with the People's Guerrilla Force, have persisted in revolutionary struggle for many years, and they have a glorious revolutionary tradition. When they saw the army they had longed for for many years, they greeted their own army with a mixture of surprise and joy. On the 120-li march from Dayu Ridge to Nanxiong County, a certain detachment of the Guangdong-Jiangxi-Hunan Border Column and the people along the way set up many tea stations, some of which also erected decorated archways. At each tea station, many welcome slogans were posted, and male and female villagers personally poured tea for the People's Liberation Army. Along the way, groups of farmers carried rice from south to north, welcoming the People's Liberation Army and delivering military grain to the grain stations. To prevent dust from falling into the grain and being exposed to the rain, they covered each of their loads with a layer of tarpaulin. Villages along the guerrilla base areas on both sides of the highway, which had long been tempered by struggle, prepared a large number of慰劳品 (consolation items) for the People's Liberation Army. In a village in Yongzheng Township, Nanxiong County, many people joined the Red Army eighteen years ago, and later more than 40 people were brutally killed by the reactionaries, and most of the houses in the village were burned down. When the people of this village heard the news that the People's Liberation Army was coming back, many people shed tears of joy. Old Mrs. Yang, a martyr's family member whose family had been killed by the reactionaries, took five pounds of pork and gave it to the People's Liberation Army. She said excitedly: "Let our army eat it to avenge us."

　　粤北人民箪食壶浆
    欢迎南下大军
    【新华社广东前线九日电】前线记者报道，粤北人民欢迎解放军的盛况称：翻过了五岭山脉的大庾岭，就到了广东地界，人民解放军沿着公路前进，歌声不绝。大庾岭南的人民曾和人民游击队一起，坚持了多年的革命斗争，他们具有光荣的革命传统。当他们看见想望多年的大军来了，都惊喜交集地迎接自己的军队。由大庾岭到南雄县城一百二十华里的进军道上，粤赣湘边纵队某支队和沿途人民，在一路上设立了许多茶水站，有的并搭了彩牌坊。各个茶水站上，都贴着许多欢迎标语，男女村民亲自为解放军斟茶。一路农民们成群结队地担着稻谷从南向北迎着解放军走来，向粮站送交军粮。为了谷里不落灰尘，不被雨淋，他们每个人的担子上都覆一层雨布。沿公路两侧游击根据地中久经斗争锻炼的村庄，为人民解放军准备了大量的慰劳品。南雄县永正乡的一个村，在十八年前曾有很多人参加了红军，后来被反动派惨杀了四十多人，全村房屋大部被烧毁了。这个村子的人民听到了解放军回来的消息，许多人欢喜得流下眼泪。家里被反动派杀光了的烈属杨老太太，拿了五斤猪肉送给解放军，她激动地说：“给咱军队吃了为我们报仇”。
