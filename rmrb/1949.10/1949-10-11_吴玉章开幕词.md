　　Wu Yuzhang's Opening Speech
    [News] Wu Yuzhang's opening speech at the inaugural meeting of the China Written Language Reform Association is as follows:
    The China Written Language Reform Association is holding its meeting after the successful conclusion of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. We are not only fortunate that our written language reform workers have good conditions for unity, but also that we have a good method for unity. Because the CPPCC is the organizational form of the people's democratic united front, that is, the organizational form of uniting democratic people from all aspects and all classes. It uses the method of consultation to coordinate opinions from all sides and has solved many major problems, enabling us to gloriously and victoriously complete the great task of establishing the People's Republic of China. This is the best method for uniting all forces to complete arduous tasks. Although China's written language reform is not as significant as establishing a new country, it is also a difficult and great task. Therefore, we must learn from the spirit of the CPPCC as our working method.
    China's written language must be reformed. This is the common opinion of the majority of people who study Chinese writing and Chinese education. China's writing, mainly Chinese characters, has many irrational aspects, making it too complicated, difficult to recognize, difficult to write, and difficult to remember. This is a serious obstacle to the popularization of education and cultural development in China. Due to this situation, since the late Qing Dynasty, many people with lofty ideals have devoted their lives to written language reform. However, under the reactionary rule, written language reform work was not encouraged. Many written language reformers could only write books behind closed doors or fight alone, unable to cooperate effectively to promote it. Various different opinions also had few opportunities for full discussion, so they could not draw on collective wisdom, and the work efficiency was not great.
    Since the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, written language reformers from various places have come to Beijing one after another. Researchers of written language reform work from universities such as China University, Revolutionary University, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, and Beijing Normal University, as well as people from all parties who had just arrived in Beijing, discussed and proposed the establishment of a national China Written Language Reform Association. With the consent of all parties, the first initiators' meeting was held by representatives from Beijing universities and representatives from all parties on May 29th. Since then, five initiators' meetings have been held successively, exchanging opinions from all parties, drafting the articles of association, sending letters asking whether or not to join this association as members, and deciding to hold the inaugural meeting today. This is the general situation of the preparation of this association.
    The purpose of this association is to unite Chinese written language reformers, and its aim is to promote Chinese written language reform, and to research and experiment with Chinese written language reform methods. The scope of unity is very broad. Not only do we want to unite those who use phonetic writing to reform Chinese writing, but also those who sort out Chinese characters, such as those who stipulate simplified Chinese characters, we must also unite them all. However, at the same time, there must be certain principles so as not to cause confusion and lack of direction, making the work lack effectiveness.
    Simplified characters, phonetic or phonetic symbols that existed in the past: such as the kana-based symbols of Lu Ganczhang, Wang Zhao, Lao Naixuan, Cai Zhang, etc.; the shorthand-based symbols of Cai Xiyong, Wang Bingyao, Chen Zhenxian, etc.; Zhang Binglin's seal script-based symbols; the image-number-based symbols of Yang Qiong, Li Wenzhi, etc.; the meaning-based symbols of Zuo Zanping; and other symbols of Ma Tigan, Gao Kunnan, etc. However, these proposals were all rejected when the National Unification of Pronunciation Conference formulated phonetic symbols in 1913. Phonetic symbols changed the "fanqie" method of marking the pronunciation of Chinese characters into a "phonetic" method, which was a major change in the history of Chinese phonology. But its purpose was only to mark the pronunciation of Chinese characters, and it did not intend to become a kind of phonetic writing. It was not until 1926 that Zhao Yuanren, Qian Xuantong, Li Jinxi, etc. formulated the National Romanization Phonetic Method in the National Romanization Phonetic Research Committee, which greatly advanced the reform of Chinese writing. The emergence of Latinized New Writing in 1931 further developed the work of Chinese writing reform. Since the Latinized New Writing has been tried out in various parts of China, it has achieved considerable success. Because Chinese writing reform is an arduous task, it must be carefully studied, obtain definite conclusions, and be systematically promoted by the state with a large amount of manpower and material resources in order to be effective. These objective and subjective conditions are not yet mature, so no matter which kind of written language reform work is done, it cannot be developed on a large scale at present. Our current task is to deepen the research on the proposals, absorb the advantages of the National Romanization, Latinized New Writing, and other reform proposals, and eliminate their shortcomings, in order to obtain a perfect proposal as a preparation for the country to carry out large-scale written language reform work in the future.
    Now we are establishing the China Written Language Reform Association, and the purpose is to systematically study and experiment with written language reform methods, and actively prepare for the conditions for actually starting written language reform in the future. We propose that the main specific tasks of the China Written Language Reform Association at present should be the following:
    1. Research on Chinese character reform. We should continue to study various proposals for Chinese character reform, and take the phonetic scheme using Latin letters as the main goal of research. The sorting and simplification of Chinese characters should also be one of our research goals.
    2. Research on Chinese and the unification of Chinese. We should continue to carry out comprehensive research on Chinese and regional investigation research, and study the issue of using the Northern dialect as the basis for unified Chinese.
    3. Research on the languages and writings of ethnic minorities. Some of China's ethnic minorities already have writing but it is not popular, and some do not yet have writing. We should systematically study the languages of these ethnic groups, and then study the reform and creation of their writing, and help the development of their language and writing education.
    4. According to the results of the above research, cooperate with the government to carry out possible experiments.
    5. Continue to publicize written language reform, so that the majority of intellectuals and the majority of people recognize the necessity of written language reform and understand our research results on written language reform.
    Today, when the war has not yet ended and the national industrial and agricultural production is still to be restored, our work will undoubtedly encounter many difficulties. But we believe that as long as we unite and work together, with the support of the People's Government, and under the conditions of the rapid development of the people's democratic cause, our difficulties will be gradually overcome, and the goal of our great cause of Chinese written language reform will be realized when the conditions are ripe.

　　吴玉章开幕词
    【又讯】吴玉章在中国文字改革协会成立大会开幕词，全文如下：
    中国文字改革协会在中国人民政治协商会议胜利闭幕后召开，不仅庆幸我们文字改革工作者有了团结的好条件，而且庆幸我们有了团结的好方法，因为中国人民政协是人民民主统一战线的组织形式，也就是团结各方面各阶层民主人士的组织形式，它用协商的方法来协调各方面的意见，解决了许多重大问题。使我们建立中华人民共和国的伟大任务很光荣地胜利完成。这是一个团结一切力量完成艰巨任务的最好的方法。中国文字改革虽然比不上建立新国家的重大，但也是一个艰难而伟大的工作，因此我们必须学习人民政协这种精神来作我们工作的方法。
    中国文字必须改革，这是多数研究中国文字和中国教育的人们的共同意见，中国的文字，主要是汉字，有许多不合理的地方，以至太过繁难，难认难写难记，这是中国教育普及文化发展的一个严重的障碍。由于这种情况，从清末以来就有不少的志士终身致力文字改革工作。但是在反动的统治之下，文字改革工作是得不到鼓励的，许多文字改革工作者只能闭户著书或只能孤军奋斗，未能通力合作切实推行，各种不同意见也很少机会充分商讨，因此不能集思广益，工作效能也就不大。
    自从京津解放以后，各地文字改革工作者陆续来到北京。华大、革大、北京、清华、燕京、师大各大学研究文字改革工作者和初到京的各方人士商讨，拟成立一个全国性的中国文字改革协会，得到各方的同意，即于五月二十九日，由北京各大学代表及各方代表开第一次发起人会，此后曾陆续开过五次发起人会，交换了各方面的意见，拟定了章程草案，发出了愿否参加本会为会员的信函，并决定于本日开成立大会，这就是本会筹备经过的大概情形。
    本会的目的是在团结中国文字改革工作者，其宗旨是提倡中国文字改革，并且研究和试验中国文字改革的方法，团结的方面是很广泛的，不仅要团结用拼音文字来改革中国文字的人，就是整理汉字如规定简体汉字等的人，我们也一律要团结。但是同时也要有一定的原则，才不致混乱无所依归，使工作缺少效果。
    从前有过的简字、拼音或注音符号：如卢戆章、王照、劳乃宣、蔡璋等的假名系符号；蔡锡勇、王炳耀、陈振先等速记系符号；章炳麟的篆文系符号；杨琼、李文治等的象数系符号；左赞平的意义系符号；其他还有马体乾、高鲲南等的符号。但是这些方案，在一九一三年读音统一会制定注音字母时都被否定了。注音字母把汉字标音的“反切”一变而为“拼音”法，这是中国音韵学史上一个大变革。但是它的目的只是在注汉字的读音，并不想成为一种拼音文字。到一九二六年赵元任、钱玄同、黎锦熙等才在国语罗马字拼音研究委员会拟定国语罗马字拼音法，这就使中国文字改革大大地进了一步。到了一九三一年拉丁化新文字出现，又使中国文字改革的工作得了新的发展。自从拉丁化新文字在中国各地试行以来，颇有不少的成绩，由于中国文字改革是一个艰巨的工作，必须经过详细研究，得到确定的结论，并由国家用庞大的人力物力加以有系统的推行，才能有效，而这种客观上和主观上的条件，现在都还不成熟，所以无论哪一种方案的文字改革的工作，现在都还不能大规模地发展。我们现在的任务，就在于加深对于方案的研究，把国语罗马字、拉丁化新文字和其他改革方案的优点都吸收过来，把它们的缺点都去掉，以便求得一个完善的方案，作为国家将来作大规模的文字改革工作的准备。
    现在我们成立中国文字改革协会，目的就是有系统地研究和试验文字改革的办法，积极准备将来实际着手文字改革的条件。我们提议，中国文字改革协会在目前的主要的具体工作，应当是以下几项：
    一、汉字改革的研究。我们应当继续研究汉字改革的各种方案，而以采用拉丁字母的拼音方案为研究的主要目标。汉字的整理和简化，也应当是我们研究的目标之一。
    二、汉语和汉语统一问题的研究。我们应当继续进行汉语的综合研究和分区的调查研究，并研究以北方话为统一汉语的基础问题。
    三、少数民族的语言文字的研究。中国的少数民族有些已有文字而不普及，有些尚无文字，我们应当有系统地研究这些民族的语言，并进而研究它们的文字的改革和创造，帮助它们的语文教育的发展。
    四、根据上述研究的结果，与政府协作进行可能的试验。
    五、继续文字改革的宣传，使多数知识分子和多数人民认识文字改革的必要，了解我们研究文字改革的成果。
    在战争尚未结束，全国工农业生产尚待恢复的今天，我们的工作无疑还要遇到许多困难。但是我们相信：只要我们团结一致，共同努力，在人民政府的赞助之下，在人民民主事业迅速发展的条件之下，我们的困难必能逐步克服，我们关于中国文字改革的伟大事业的目的必能在条件成熟时实现。
