　　Protest Against the Reactionary Clique of Tsaldaris!
　　He Jiahuai
　　After seeing the news that the Greek reactionary government sentenced Katina Tsaragani, a leader of the Democratic Women's Federation, to death, I felt extremely angry and believed that this was one of the greatest crimes and atrocities of the Greek reactionaries.
　　Since the feudal fascists seized power, the Greek national economy has declined to the extreme in the past three years or more. The general level of industrial production is only 60% of the pre-war level, and the situation of agricultural production is particularly miserable. Income has plummeted, prices have soared, and the lives of ordinary people have been reduced to a very low level. Not only is there no guarantee for the lives of farmers, who are constantly struggling on the brink of starvation, but as many as 960,000 people have been expelled from their hometowns because the Greek reactionary government wanted to use this violent method to create a "vacuum zone" around the liberated areas and prevent farmers from assisting the democratic army. These Greek farmers who were forced to leave their homes had no food, no shelter, and no jobs. It is unknown how many died of hunger, cold, and disease. This is indeed a fatal blow to Greek agricultural production, because Greek agriculture is the foundation of the entire national economy.
　　What is particularly severe is the Greek reactionary government's policy of terror. According to unreliable official figures, which are much lower than the actual figures, 19,680 people have been thrown into concentration camps by military courts in recent years, 4,560 people have been thrown into prisons, and 2,733 people have been sentenced to death—of which 1,251 people (including 162 women) have been killed. In tiny Greece, these numbers are already very scary, but compared with the unannounced number of people killed by fascist bandits, they are as insignificant as a drop in the ocean. In addition, countless innocent people have been exiled to barren islands where even fresh water is not available. On the two islands of Euboea and Ikaria alone, 32,000 Greek patriots are waiting to die. Among the exiles, there are more than 7,000 women; and the number of women detained by the fascists in Greece without trial reaches about 3,000, including more than 1,200 children, and even babies in swaddling clothes.
　　However, the people of Greece will never bow their heads and refuse to submit. They have risen up to resist the oppression of the Tsaldaris government and its master, the American imperialists. The increasingly powerful democratic army has become stronger and stronger in battle. In vast areas, especially in the Grammos Mountains, it has repeatedly wiped out the royalist fascist army directly commanded by American generals and achieved brilliant victories. The prestige of the Greek Communist Party has increased day by day, and the Greek Provisional Democratic Government has also won the support of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, although the American imperialists and their agents in Greece—the Tsaldaris gang—have spent a lot of money and weapons and carried out frenzied offensives and bloody suppression, their conspiracy to enslave the Greek people has obviously suffered a shameful defeat.
　　In the democratic movement against the royalist fascists, the activities of the Greek Women's Federation are multifaceted, and its influence and role are great. Its members are all the most outstanding, bravest, and most determined female soldiers and heroines who strive for the freedom and independence of Greece. Because they refuse to obey the royalist fascists and do not want to be slaves, they have always fought unyieldingly against the enemies of democracy. Therefore, they have always been hated by the executioners in Athens, who always want to eliminate them and their organizations—especially their leaders. But this organization can never be eliminated by force. This arrogant attempt will only make it more consolidated and expanded. When the All-Greek Women's Congress was held in March of this year, among the 325 representatives, some were female soldiers in the democratic army. They even walked for 20 to 25 days to participate, not only enduring the hardships of trekking, but also fighting the enemy at any time to open the way. The representatives from the royalist fascist-controlled areas bravely broke through the enemy's blockade and arrived in the liberated areas where the conference was held. From this example, we can also see how heroic and determined Greek women are. No wonder many poets want to sing praises for them.
　　However, the stronger the democratic forces in Greece, the more intense and frenzied the reactionaries' struggle becomes. American imperialism not only supplies its Greek lackeys with airplanes, artillery, tanks, and flamethrowers, but also secretly supplies poison gas, and even openly recruits soldiers and horses for it, re-employs German fascist soldiers, and wins over the Yugoslavian traitor and traitor Tito to form a reactionary alliance. The Greek royalist fascist group headed by Tsaldaris, following its master's orders, desperately stepped up its offensive against the democratic army, massacred innocent civilians, and exhausted its barbaric and cruel, inhumane means. Therefore, the persecution of the Greek Democratic Women's Federation and its leaders is indeed a planned conspiracy by the American imperialists and their Greek running dogs. It is one of the crimes they have committed against the Greek people and progressive elements over the years.
　　We must rise up to oppose this atrocity. Although our National Democratic Women's Federation has already lodged a stern protest, I believe this is not enough. The people of the whole country, the groups of the whole country—especially the China Branch of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace—must all lodge strong protests, demanding that the Tsaldaris reactionary government immediately revoke the unreasonable verdict and unconditionally restore Katina Tsaragani's freedom.

　　向曹达利斯的反动集团抗议！
    何家槐
    看到希腊反动政府判处民主妇联领袖卡特林·塔拉甘尼以死刑的消息以后，我感到了无比的愤怒，认为这是希腊反动派的最大罪行和最大暴行之一。
    在封建法西斯窃取政权以后，在三年多的时期中，希腊的国民经济已经衰落到了极点，工业生产的一般水平，只有战前的百分之六十，农业生产的情况尤其可怜，收入锐减，物价高涨，一般人的生活，都降至极低限度。农民们不但生活毫无保障，经常挣扎在饥饿线上，而且竟有九十几万人被驱逐出自己的家乡，因为希腊的反动政府想以这种狂暴的方法来造成一个解放区周围的“真空地带”，阻止农民们援助民主军队。这些被迫离乡背井的希腊农民，没有衣食，没有住处，没有职业，死于饥寒和疾病的不知多少。这实在是一个对于希腊农业生产的致命打击，因为希腊的农业是整个国民经济的基础。
    尤其厉害的，是希腊反动政府的恐怖政策。据不可靠的低于实际很多的官方公布的数字，这几年来已有一万九千六百八十人被军事法庭投入集中营，已有四千五百六十人投入监狱，二千七百三十三人被判处死刑—其中有一千二百五十一人（包括一百六十二名妇女在内）已被杀害了。在小小的希腊，这些数字本身已是非常的可怕，但和那些被法西斯匪特杀害的未被公布的人数比较起来，却犹如沧海一粟，渺小得很。此外，还有无数无辜的人被放逐到连淡水也得不到的荒岛上去，仅只在幼拉和伊迦利亚两个岛上，就有三万二千个希腊爱国者坐待死亡。在流放者中竟有七千多个妇女；而被关在法西斯的希腊从未经过审讯的妇女，则达三千个左右，内有一千二百余名儿童，甚至有尚在襁褓中的婴儿。
    可是希腊的人民是决不会低头，不愿屈服的，他们已经纷纷地起来反抗曹达利斯政府及其主子美帝国主义者的压迫。日益壮大起来的民主军愈战愈强，在广大的地区，尤其是格拉姆斯山区，曾经一再歼灭在美国将军直接指挥下的保皇法西斯军队，获得辉煌的战绩；希共的威信日益增加，希腊的临时民主政府，也获得了广大人民的拥护；因而美帝国主义及其在希腊的代理人——曹达利斯匪帮，虽则化费了大量的金钱、武器，进行了疯狂的进攻和血腥的镇压，但其奴役希腊人民的阴谋，显然已经遭到了可耻的失败。
    在反抗保皇法西斯的民主运动中，希腊妇联的活动是多方面的，它的影响和作用很大。它的盟员，都是争取希腊自由与独立的，最优秀最勇敢最坚决的女战士和女英雄，因为她们不肯服从保皇法西斯和不愿作奴隶，始终不屈不挠地和民主的敌人斗争，所以被雅典的刽子手们一向恨之入骨，随时都想把她们以及她们的组织——尤其是她们的领导者消灭。但这个组织却是决不能以武力消灭的，这种狂妄的企图只会使它更巩固和更扩大。当今年三月间举行全希腊妇代大会的时候，在三百二十五个代表之中，有些是民主军部队里的女战士，她们甚至步行了二十至二十五天之久赶来参加，一路上不但备尝跋涉之苦，而且还要随时和敌人战斗，以开辟道路；从保皇法西斯统治区域来的代表们，则勇敢地冲过敌人的封锁线，而到了召开大会的解放区。从这一个例子中，也可以看出希腊妇女是如何的英雄和坚决，难怪很多诗人要为她们而歌颂了。
    但希腊的民主势力越壮大，反动派的挣扎也越其厉害，越其疯狂，美帝国主义不但供其希腊鹰犬以飞机、大炮、坦克、火焰放射器，而且秘密供给毒瓦斯，甚至公开为其招兵买马，起用德国法西斯军人，并为其拉拢南斯拉夫的卖国贼和叛徒铁托，使其结成反动的联盟。而以曹达利斯为首的希腊保皇法西斯集团，则秉承其主子的命令，拚命加紧的进攻民主军，屠杀无辜的平民，极尽其野蛮惨酷，绝灭人性的能事。因此，希腊民主妇联及其领袖之遭受迫害，实在是美帝及其希腊走狗们的有计划的阴谋，是他们几年来加害于希腊人民和进步分子的罪行之一。
    我们要起来反对这种暴行，我们的全国民主妇联虽则已经提出了严正的抗议，但我认为这样还不够，必须全国的人民，全国的团体——尤其是世界拥护和平大会中国分会，大家一齐提出强硬的抗议，要求曹达利斯反动政府立即取消无理的判决，并无条件地恢复卡特林·塔拉甘尼的自由。
