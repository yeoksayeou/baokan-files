　　【Beijing News】The text of Beijing Mayor Nie Rongzhen’s speech at the opening ceremony of the Beijing People’s Sports Meet is as follows:

　　Distinguished guests, all workers, soldiers, students, and citizens participating in the performances and competitions:

　　The first Beijing People’s Sports Meet is now open. First of all, I would like to express my praise and respect to the gentlemen who participated in preparing for the conference, the sports community of Beijing, and all the athletes participating in the performances and competitions. Your efforts to actively develop new sports, your enthusiasm for serving the people, and your spirit of cooperation and mutual assistance are important factors for the smooth convening of this conference. Secondly, on behalf of all the people of Beijing and this People’s Sports Meet, I would like to extend a warm welcome to the gentlemen from the Northwest, Northeast, East China, Central China, and Tianjin visiting delegations who have come from afar. We believe that this is a symbol of the great unity of sports workers across China. We hope that you will provide more guidance to the conference and share valuable experiences. At the same time, the sports community in Beijing hopes to unite strongly with the sports communities across the country and organize a national sports leadership organization to jointly study and develop the new sports cause of the people.

　　Our holding of this Beijing People’s Sports Meet has two major significances:

　　The first is to celebrate the founding of our People’s Republic of China. As everyone knows, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, organized by representatives of the Chinese Communist Party, various democratic parties, various people’s organizations, various regions, the People’s Liberation Army, various ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic elements, represents the will of the people of the whole country. It has announced the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, organized the people’s own Central People’s Government, and elected the great people’s leader Mao Zedong as the Chairman of the Central People’s Government. The people of the whole country love this newborn motherland and cheer and celebrate her birth. A high tide of celebration has swept across the country. Our People’s Sports Meet is one of the many celebration programs. This is the first significance.

　　The second significance is to launch an appeal for the development of the new sports movement of the people. Over the past thirty years, Chinese sports has made some achievements and progress, but it also has major shortcomings. With the birth of New China, we must have the correct direction of sports and new sports content. We should recognize that sports is a science that studies and develops the human body’s ability to work. It must serve the purpose of developing production and consolidating national defense. The new sports is inseparable from the industrial construction and national defense construction of New Democracy. It should serve to cultivate a large number of healthy, strong, and brave workers, farmers, and army, navy, and air force personnel, and to improve the health of various working people. The past view of “sports for sports’ sake” is wrong. It has caused sports to lose its most important meaning, and we should quickly abandon it.

　　The new sports must be of the people. The new sports must be quickly popularized as mass national sports. In the past, sports was often limited to schools or intellectual circles. Some people misunderstood that only holding sports meets is sports. Now it is different. We want to develop sports from schools to factories, from cities to rural areas, from intellectual circles to the laboring class, so that sports becomes a part of the lives of our broad masses of people. Of course, we also have to hold sports meets. Our sports meets cannot include everyone, but this is to exchange experiences, promote advantages, improve levels, and expand influence, not to take it as the sole purpose of sports.

　　The new sports must inherit the excellent traditions of the broad nation on the one hand, and learn from the successful experiences of the Soviet Union and people’s democratic countries on the other hand. Its form, whether it is playing ball, running, wielding knives, parachuting, or practicing boxing; whether it is Chinese or foreign, as long as it can exercise the body, improve health, and conform to the purpose of consolidating national defense and developing production, we think it is good, and we must retain it, transform it, and promote it. For the sports policies and educational methods that the Soviet Union has proven to be able to achieve the above-mentioned goals in thirty years of experience, we must learn humbly.

　　In short, with the birth of the People’s Republic of China, we must give Chinese sports a new life. So that it can serve national defense and production, so that it can become a national, mass, scientific educational tool, able to defend the motherland and increase the health and happiness of the people of the motherland.

　　Therefore, the new sports movement has the necessity of rapid development. We hope that this People’s Sports Meet will be an appeal and at the same time the beginning of the new sports movement. This is the second significance of the conference.

　　This conference was prepared in a hurry. Due to the lack of material conditions and insufficient experience, the scale of the conference cannot meet the expectations of all parties, and it is very likely that there are many unnecessary shortcomings. But thanks to everyone’s assistance, it was finally able to open as scheduled. I would like to express my gratitude here to the organizations, groups, and friends from all walks of life who have sponsored this conference.

　　At the same time, I hope that all the gentlemen who participated in the preparatory work will carefully summarize this experience, so that we can all understand what we have learned in this sports meet? What are the benefits to the people? Which are good and should continue to be promoted? Which are not good and should be transformed? If we can summarize these experiences, they can become weapons to educate ourselves and become reference materials for various places and the next sports meet.

　　The components participating in this conference include workers, soldiers, students, citizens, etc. The number of people performing and competing reached 16,786. The gentlemen participating in the preparatory work of the conference, including physical education teachers from large, medium, and small schools, number more than 200, after a district preliminary election held simultaneously in five districts. In the process of preparation, especially in the process of preliminary selection, it was found that many teachers and students of the school used the spirit of collective creation to create programs with great educational significance and sports value. Many gentlemen not only spared time to participate in the work, but also personally drew field lines and moved things on an empty stomach. One thing, one problem, is mostly done by everyone and discussed by everyone. Most of the units participating in the performances and competitions can disregard gains and losses, abide by order, and abide by the opinions of the referees, fully demonstrating the spirit of democratic unity and a high degree of experience of the meaning of people's sports. This is the new atmosphere of the founding of the country, which is deeply worthy of our celebration and praise. I hope that the spirit shown in the preliminary round can be fully brought to the conference, and at the same time, I hope that everyone will further unite and organize concretely, and strive for the development of the people's sports cause in New China under the banner of Mao Zedong.

　　体育大会开幕典礼上
  　聂荣臻市长讲演词
    【北京讯】北京市聂荣臻市长在北京市人民体育大会开幕典礼中的讲话，文如下：
    诸位来宾、参加表演竞赛的全体工人、士兵、学生、市民们：
    首都第一届人民体育大会现在开幕了。首先我要向这次参加筹备大会工作的先生们，北京市的体育界，和参加表演与竞赛的全体健儿们表示赞扬和敬意。你们这种积极发展新体育的努力，为人民服务的热忱和合作互助的精神，是这次大会顺利召开的重要因素。其次，我代表北京市全体人民和本届人民体育大会向远道而来的西北、东北、华东、华中、天津参观团的诸位先生们致以热烈的欢迎。我们认为这是全中国体育工作者大团结的象征。希望诸位先生对大会多予以指导，多介绍宝贵的经验；同时，我们北京体育界更希望与全国各地体育界坚强地团结起来，组织一个全国性的体育领导机构，来共同研究和发展人民大众的新体育事业。
    我们这次举行北京市人民体育大会有两个重大的意义：
    第一个，就是庆祝我们中华人民共和国的成立。大家都知道，由中国共产党、各民主党派、各人民团体、各地区、人民解放军、各少数民族、国外华侨及其他爱国民主分子的代表们所组织的中国人民政治协商会议，代表着全国人民的意志，已宣告中华人民共和国成立，组织了人民自己的中央人民政府，选举了伟大的人民领袖毛泽东为中央人民政府主席。全国人民热爱着这新生的祖国，为她的诞生而欢呼、庆祝。全国各地均曾腾起庆祝的高潮，我们这次人民体育大会就是许许多多庆祝节目中的一个，这是第一个意义。
    第二个意义，就是为开展人民大众的新体育运动作一次号召。三十几年来，中国的体育曾有若干成就和进步，但也存在着很大缺点。随着新中国的诞生，我们必须有正确的体育方向和新的体育内容。我们应该认清楚体育是研究与发展人体劳动能力的科学。它必须为发展生产和巩固国防的目的而服务。新的体育与新民主主义的工业建设和国防建设是分不开的。它应当为培养大量的身体健康、坚强勇敢的工人、农民和陆海空军人员和增进现在各种劳动人民的健康而服务。过去“为体育而体育”的看法是不对的，它使体育丧失了最重要的意义，我们应当赶快抛弃掉。
    新的体育必须是人民大众的。新的体育必须迅速普及为群众性的国民体育。过去体育往往局限于学校或知识界里。有些人误解只有开运动会才是体育。现在不同了，我们要把体育从学校发展到工厂，从城市发展到农村，从知识界发展到劳动界，使体育成为我们广大人民生活的一部分。当然，我们也要举行体育会，我们的体育会也不能包括一切人，但这是为了交流经验，发扬优点，提高水平，扩大影响而开的，并不是把它作为体育的唯一目的。
    新的体育一方面要承受广大民族的优良传统，一方面要学习苏联和人民民主国家成功的经验。它的形式不论是打球、赛跑、劈刀、跳伞、打拳；不论是中国的、外国的，凡能锻炼身体、增进健康，符合于巩固国防、发展生产的目的，我们就认为是好的，要保留、要改造、要发扬。对于苏联在三十年经验中已经证明是能达到上述目的的体育方针和教育方法，我们就要虚心地学习。
    总之，随着中华人民共和国的诞生，我们就必须给予中国的体育一个新生命。使它能为国防与生产服务，使它成为民族的，人民大众的，科学的教育工具。能保卫祖国和增进祖国人民的健康和幸福。
    因此，新的体育运动有迅速开展的必要。我们希望这次人民体育大会是一个号召，同时是新的体育运动的开始。这是大会的第二个意义。
    这次大会筹备的很仓促，由于物资条件的缺乏和经验的不够，使大会的规模不能符各方的期望，而且很可能有着许多不应有的缺点。但由于大家的协助，使它终于能如期如开，我谨在这儿向各界赞助本会的机关、团体和朋友们致谢。
    同时希望参加筹备工作的诸位先生们，好好的总结这次经验，使我们大家明白在这次体育大会中，究竟学习了什么？对于人民究竟有什么好处？哪些是好的，该继续发扬？哪些是不好的，要予以改造？这些经验，如果我们能总结出来，就可成为教育我们自己的武器，和成为各地以及下次体育大会的参考材料。
    参加这次大会的成分，包括工人、军人、学生、市民等，表演与竞赛的人数共达一万六千七百八十六人。参加大会筹备工作的先生们，包括大中小学的体育教师，人数在两百人以上，经过了一次分为五区同时举行的分区预选。在筹备过程中，尤其是在预选过程中，发现很多学校的先生和学生运用集体创造的精神，创造出有极大教育意义和体育价值的节目。有很多先生不但不惜时间参加工作，而且有时饿着肚子亲自划场线、搬东西。一件事一个问题，多是大家来做和大家来商量。参加表演和竞赛的各单位，大多能不计较得失，遵守秩序和遵守裁判的意见，充分表现民主团结的精神，和高度的体验了人民体育的意义。这是开国的新气象，深值得我们庆幸和表扬的。希望在预赛中所表现的精神，能完全带到大会来，同时更希望大家进一步地团结起来，具体地组织起来，在毛泽东的旗帜下，为发展新中国的人民体育事业而奋斗。（附图片）
