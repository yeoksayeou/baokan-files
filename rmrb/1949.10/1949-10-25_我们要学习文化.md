　　We Must Study Culture
　　Kaifu
　　In the past, the printing factory of a certain army corps stationed in Tianjin merely followed the organization's regulations, finding materials in the newspaper every day, with the section chiefs responsible for giving political lessons. Since starting military training—studying culture—the comrades' enthusiasm for cultural learning has also surged. Cultural learning is for all, cadres and workers alike, divided into three classes—A, B, and C—and a literacy class, according to their cultural level.
　　Chen Shangshu, from the literacy class, is the factory's cook. He was very happy when he heard about the large-scale military training—cultural learning. He often said, "This time we've encountered a good opportunity to teach us to learn steadily. Now I can barely manage to write a letter!" The messenger, Liu Yujiang, also only started learning to read after joining the revolution. Now, he can not only write simple letters, but has also contributed three or four articles to the wall newspaper. He said, "If I hadn't joined the revolution, forget about writing articles or letters, humph! I probably wouldn't even be able to write my own name. This time, I must take this opportunity to study hard, and I must learn to read books and newspapers."
　　The binding and machine rooms are in one large room, so the binding table has become everyone's podium and study table. In addition to conducting cultural lessons during the day using the "little teacher" system, whenever the newspaper is printed at night, the binding workers also help turn the wheel. Watching the continuous paper tape and ink are done in shifts. Those who are off shift gather around this binding podium. Old Jin's pencil tip is dedicated to learning new characters every night; Old Zhao bought a dictionary and carries it in his pocket, so he can look up words anytime, anywhere. As soon as the plates are ready and the machine starts running, the comrades work and gather around the binding podium, using this off-shift time to conduct extracurricular collective learning. New characters learned from the newspaper, new characters learned from books, or new characters to be learned tomorrow—at this time, everyone writes them out, and whoever knows them speaks up. Old Zhao looks up the dictionary, both recognizing and explaining. Our workshop's learning does not hinder the work at all (there is a record of how many sheets each person prints incorrectly each day). We are all very happy when someone knows a character and explains it to everyone. Once, Deng Jianchang was so happy that he cranked the wheel one hundred and fifty times in one go.
　　The typesetting section has the best writing achievements. Among the eleven people in typesetting, engraving, and typecasting, not a single one doesn't write articles. Qin Xiyuan from typesetting, Zhang Yihe from engraving, and Bu Baocheng from typecasting all contribute two or three articles to each issue of the wall newspaper.
　　There are two proofreaders, one who is responsible for being the factory's "little teacher" along with the clerk, and one who is responsible for editing the wall newspaper. Those who don't write well ask them for help. Out of more than thirty people, only six or seven are too busy with work or know too few characters to write, so since the military training began, the factory's wall newspaper has expanded from one large door panel to two large door panels. Everyone feels: We must work hard to study culture!

### 我们要学习文化

　　我们要学习文化
    凯夫
    驻津某兵团印刷厂过去的学习，只不过按照组织上的规定，每天在报纸上找材料，由各股股长负责上政治课。自从开始练兵——学习文化以来，同志们对文化学习的情绪也高涨起来了。文化学习是不分干部工人，依照文化水平分成甲、乙、丙三班及识字班。
    识字班的陈尚书，是厂里的炊事员。他一听说大练兵——文化学习，就非常高兴，他常说：“这回遇上这好机会，教咱们踏踏实实的学习，现在我也能凑合合的写封信了。”通信员刘玉江，也是参加革命以后才开始识字的，现在不但能写简单的信，而且在墙报上还投了三四篇稿子。他说：“要不是我参加革命，也甭说是写稿、写信，哼！连自己的名字恐怕都写不了，这回，我趁这机会，一定要好好的学习，非学到能看书、看报才行。”
    装订和机器房是在一个大屋里，所以装订的案子就成了大家的讲台与学习台，我们除了白天按步就班的用小先生制进行文化课以外，每当晚上印报时，装订的也帮助摇轮，连续纸带看墨都是轮流的，在替班下来的。就聚在这装订讲台周围，老金的铅笔头是每晚学生字专用的；老赵买了个字典装在口袋里，随时随地能查字。一上好版，机器开始响起来时，同志们一边工作，一边围在装订讲台旁，利用这替班休息的时间来进行课外的集体学习，报纸上看来的生字，书上看来的生字，或者是明天要学的生字，这时，大家写出来，大家谁会谁说，老赵查字典，连认带讲。我们的工作间的学习，对于工作是毫无妨碍的（每天谁印坏了几张都有记录）。我们谁要是独自知道一个字，给大家讲解完了以后，都非常的高兴，有一回，邓建昌一高兴，一气摇了一百五十下轮子。
    排字股的写稿成绩是第一，连刻字的，铸字的一共十一个人，没有一个不写稿子的，排字的秦锡元，刻字的张义和，铸字的卜保成，哪一期墙报都是两篇三篇的投稿。
    校对是两个人，一个是跟文书负责当厂里的小先生，一个是负责墙报的编辑，写不好的都找他们给帮忙，三十多人，只有六七个工作太忙的和识字太少的写不出来，所以自练兵以来，厂里的墙报由一个大门板扩大到两个大门板了。大家都感到：我们要努力学习文化！
