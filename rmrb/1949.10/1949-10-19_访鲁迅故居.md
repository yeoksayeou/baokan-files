Visiting Lu Xun's Former Residence
    Bai Sheng

    On a bright autumn day, a reporter visited Mr. Lu Xun's former residence.

    Mr. Lu Xun's former residence is located at No. 21, West Third Alley, West City, Beijing. A newly painted black Chinese-style gate, a gray earthen wall, surrounds what appears to be a rather small house. On the wall to the right of the gate are the four green characters "Lu Xun's Former Residence," the calligraphy of Mr. Guo Moruo.

    Inside the gate is a small and elegant courtyard. In the middle of the courtyard is a jujube tree, and there is another jujube tree near the corner of the wall outside the door leading from the front yard to the back garden. In 1924, Mr. Lu Xun wrote the article "Autumn Night" in this house, mentioning that there were two jujube trees outside the wall of his back garden. Therefore, these two jujube trees are very noticeable. They stand dignifiedly, their branches still piercing the sky as they did in the past.

    The reporter was led into the north room by an old man, sent by the People's Government to look after the house. The small room was already crowded with people, filled with pleasant conversation and laughter. In the famous small room called "Tiger's Tail," where Lu Xun wrote during his lifetime, Ms. Xu Guangping and several comrades from the Cultural Relics Department were busy tidying and arranging things. The house is being arranged, the walls have been whitewashed, and the doors and windows have been newly painted with black and vermilion paint.

    This is an old-fashioned Beijing courtyard house, with three rooms facing south, divided into two rooms, one large and one small, which were used as a study and living room during Lu Xun's lifetime. The east and west厢房 (xiāngfáng, wing rooms) both have two rooms. The east厢房 is filled with dusty old furniture, and the west厢房 is temporarily occupied by the caretaker. The north room also has three rooms, with a hall in the middle, where Lu Xun ate during his lifetime. The east room was then occupied by Lu Xun's mother, and the west room was the residence of Lu Xun's former wife, Madame Zhu. The famous "Tiger's Tail" was Lu Xun's writing room and bedroom, located behind the hall. From the large glass window of the "Tiger's Tail," we can see the back garden he often mentioned.

    Ms. Xu is arranging everything in the house according to the old appearance in her memory. The room called "Tiger's Tail" is arranged as simply and plainly as it was during Lu Xun's lifetime: a bed, a desk, a bookshelf. The desk is arranged as before, except for the pen holder, inkstone, and inkwell, the kerosene lamp that accompanied Lu Xun in his late-night writing year after year, and a small table clock, all placed in their original places. On the wall by the desk hangs a photograph of Mr. Fujino, who made the deepest impression on Lu Xun when he studied medicine in Japan, and a charcoal drawing of the scene of the Northern Warlords massacring students, "Five Policemen and One Student." The pair of pillows on the bed were made by Ms. Xu Guangping herself. Someone lifted the bed sheet and discovered an old mesh basket. Ms. Xu said, "This is a mesh basket that Lu Xun carried with him, he was always ready to leave." Yes, Lu Xun lived a life of constant struggle with the reactionaries. His strong fighting will made him ready to fight in different places at any time, and he would never yield to the reactionaries.

    Someone suggested going to the back garden to take a look. Led by Ms. Xu, we walked through the small door from the front yard to the back garden. She pointed out to us one by one the flowering plum and prickly ash trees that Mr. Lu Xun planted himself. Someone asked about the two jujube trees outside the wall of the back garden, but they can no longer be seen. Ms. Xu kicked a dry jujube root and said, "There used to be a jujube tree here, but I don't know who sawed it off later." We can no longer see the weeds that Mr. Lu Xun mentioned, let alone the little red flowers dreaming there.

    The old man in charge of the house talked about the visit of the Soviet cultural and artistic workers delegation the day before. They seemed so fresh and fond of everything in the house.

    Now, this Beijing-style house, although like many other similar houses, appears very small and simple, but because of the victory of the people, it will be admired by people for all time with the glorious name of "Lu Xun's Former Residence."

　　访鲁迅故居
    柏生
    在一个明朗的秋日，记者访问鲁迅先生的故居。
    鲁迅先生的故居在北京西城，西三条二十一号。一所新油饰的黑色中式大门，一堵灰色的土墙，围着一所看来相当矮小的房子。大门右面墙上刻着“鲁迅故居”四个绿字，那是郭沫若先生的手笔。
    大门里是一个小而雅致的院子。院子当中有一株枣树，在前院通往后园的门外墙角边还有一株枣树。一九二四年，鲁迅先生在这所屋子写了“秋夜”一文，提到在他的后园墙外有两株枣树。所以这两株枣树是很令人注意的。它们端庄地矗立着，它们的枝干仍象往日一样地刺向天空。
    记者被人民政府派来看管房子的老者引进北屋。小小的屋子里已经挤满了人，充满着愉快的谈话声和笑声。在鲁迅生前写作的那间著名的叫作“老虎尾巴”的小房里，许广平先生正和文物处的几个同志忙碌地整理、布置着。房子正在布置，墙壁已经刷白，门窗用墨色的、朱红色的油漆油饰一新。
    这是一所旧式的北京四合房院，南面三间，隔成了一大一小的两个房间，在鲁迅生前是当作书房和客厅的。东西厢房都是两间。东厢房堆满着尘封的旧家具，西厢房暂时住着守房人。北房也是三间，中间是一间堂屋，鲁迅生前吃饭的地方。东面的一间那时住着鲁迅的母亲，西面的一间是鲁迅前妻朱夫人的住室。那间著名的“老虎尾巴”，是鲁迅的写作间兼作卧室，在堂屋的后面。从“老虎尾巴”的大玻璃窗望出去，我们可以看见他常提到的后园。
    许先生按照记忆中的旧样子，布置着房子里的一切。这个称做“老虎尾巴”的房间，布置得依然是鲁迅生前那样朴素简单：一张床，一张书桌，一个书架。书桌的摆设依旧，除了笔架、墨盒、墨池外，那盏终年伴着鲁迅在深夜写作的煤油灯，还有一面小小的座钟，也都放在原来的地方。靠桌的墙壁上挂着鲁迅在日本学医时给他印象最深的藤野先生的照片，和一张画着北洋军阀屠杀学生情景的“五个警察一个学生”的炭画。床上放的一对枕头，还是许广平先生当年亲手做的。是谁把床单撩开了一下，发现了一只破旧的网篮，许先生说：“这是鲁迅随身带着的一个网篮，他是随时都准备着出走的。”是的，鲁迅生活在和反动派不断战斗的生活中，他的坚强的战斗意志，使他随时准备转地作战，而决不向反动派屈服。
    有人提议要到后园去看看，我们由许先生领着，由前院通后园的小门走了过去。她一一指点我们那是鲁迅先生亲手种植的刺梅、花椒。有人问起后园墙外的两株枣树，现在已经看不见了。许先生用脚踢着一根已经干枯了的枣树根说：“这里原有一株枣树，不知后来被谁锯掉了。”我们已经看不见鲁迅先生所说的那些野草，更看不见小红花在那里作梦了。
    看房的老人谈到前一天苏联文化艺术工作者代表团参观这房子的情形，他们看到这房子的一切，都显得那么新鲜和喜欢。
    现在这所北京式的房子，虽然和其它许多同样的房子一样，显得十分矮小简朴，但是由于人民的胜利，它将随着“鲁迅故居”这个光辉的名字，而被人们千秋万代地景仰着。
