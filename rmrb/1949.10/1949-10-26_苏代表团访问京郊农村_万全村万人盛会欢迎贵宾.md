Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 25th: The Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers' delegation visited the new China's countryside in the Sixteenth District of the western suburbs of Beijing yesterday, where they were warmly welcomed and entertained by the farmers. In the morning, the Sixteenth District Farmers' Association held a welcome rally of nearly ten thousand people in Wanquan Village. Farmers beat drums and gongs, and held high red flags, gathering in the square. The venue was decorated with portraits of Chairman Mao and Stalin. When the Soviet delegation entered, all the farmers in the audience enthusiastically cheered, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Stalin!" The Soviet delegation and farmers' representatives shook hands warmly. Dubrovinina, Deputy Minister of Education of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and agricultural scientist Stoletov, spoke successively at the meeting. Dubrovinina pointed out that due to the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese revolution had achieved victory. After the land reform, the peasants were given land and became masters of the country. She also said that the Soviet revolution had been successful for more than 30 years, and Soviet agriculture had been transformed. There are now large-scale collective farms. The lives of Soviet farmers are getting better day by day. Stoletov said in his speech that many labor heroes have emerged in Soviet agricultural production. Because they have created many methods in production, the harvest is getting better day by day. One mu of wheat can yield six to seven hundred catties, and one mu of rice can yield more than one thousand catties. We hope that Chinese farmers can go to the Soviet Union to see how Soviet farmers farm and live, and hope that Chinese farmers will achieve greater success and victory in production. The Soviet Union is willing to provide Chinese farmers with a lot of experience. Their speeches won applause and cheers from the audience. Next was the farmers' tribute. Batch after batch of farmers placed the pumpkins, eggs, peanuts, vermicelli, straw sandals, liquor, embroidered handkerchiefs, etc. they produced with their own hands in front of the Soviet delegation. Simonov, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, thanked the farmers for their warm gifts. After the speech, the famous Soviet singer Smyelov sang famous songs such as "The Sea is Smiling" and "March of the Democratic Youth". Then the delegation's art troupe performed the "Competition Dance." Both performances were enthusiastically welcomed by the farmers. The China Youth Performing Arts Troupe also performed solo singing and the Yangko dance. Finally, the farmers of the Sixteenth District performed programs such as "Tiger Fighting Stick" and "Arranging the Chai Wang Formation". The Soviet delegation also showed great interest in the farmers' performances.

After the meeting, Simonov, Stoletov and other members of the Soviet delegation summoned more than fifty farmer representatives for a discussion; Dubrovinina and others visited the central primary school of the Sixteenth District; other representatives visited farmer families in Bagou Village. At the forum, Simonov and Stoletov expressed particular concern about China's rural land reform and future development of production. He listened very enthusiastically to the situation of rural land reform. (Attached picture)

　　苏代表团访问京郊农村　
    万全村万人盛会欢迎贵宾
    【新华社北京二十五日电】苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团昨日赴北京西郊十六区访问新中国的农村，在那里受到农民热诚的欢迎和招待。上午，十六区农会在万全村召开了近万人的欢迎大会，农民们打着锣鼓，高举红旗，聚集在广场上，会场高悬着毛主席与斯大林的画像。当苏联代表团入场时，全场农民均热烈欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“斯大林万岁！”苏联代表团和农民代表们亲切地握手。会上俄罗斯联邦共和国人民教育部副部长杜伯洛维娜和农业科学家斯托列托夫都先后讲话。杜伯洛维娜指出：由于共产党和毛主席的领导，中国革命获得了胜利。农民经过土改后分得了土地，而成了国家的主人。她又说：苏联革命成功已三十多年，苏联农业已经过了改造，现在已有大规模的集体农庄。苏联农民生活一天比一天的好起来了。斯托列托夫讲话中说：苏联农民在生产中出现许多劳动英雄，由于他们在生产中创造了很多办法，收成一天比一天好，一亩麦子能收六、七百斤，一亩稻子能收一千多斤。我们很希望中国的农民能到苏联去看看苏联的农民怎样种地怎样生活，并希望中国农民在生产中获得更大的成功与胜利。苏联有很多经验愿意供给中国农民。他们两人的讲话博得了全场的掌声与欢呼声。接着就是农民们的献礼，一批批的农民把他们亲手生产的南瓜、鸡蛋、花生、粉条、草鞋、烧酒、绣花手帕等，一大堆地摆在苏联代表团面前。西蒙诺夫代表苏联代表团向农民们的热忱的献礼致谢。讲话后由苏联代表团名歌唱家史灭略夫演唱“海在笑”、“民主青年进行曲”等名歌。然后代表团艺术演出队演出“比赛舞”。这两项表演都受到了农民们狂热的欢迎。我国青年出国文工团也表演了独唱和大秧歌舞。最后，十六区农民表演打虎棍和摆柴王阵等节目，苏联代表团对农民的演出也感到极大兴趣。
    会后苏联代表团西蒙诺夫、斯托列托夫等召集了五十余农民代表举行座谈会；杜伯洛维娜等去访问了十六区中心小学；其他代表分别去巴沟村访问农民家庭。在座谈会上，西蒙诺夫和斯托列托夫对于中国农村的土地改革以及今后发展生产的情况表示特别关切，他他很热心地听取了农村土地改革的情况。（附图片）
