　　(Translated from the June 15th English edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!")

　　On May 19th, as Mr. Churchill was accepting an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Liverpool, two thousand people in the city gathered to send this war-mongering ringleader a special telegram.

　　Here are excerpts from the telegram: "Your resume is one of incessant opposition to workers in all countries of the world, and today you are again leading the most reactionary elements everywhere in an attempt to plunge the globe into a third world war... We, the true representatives of peace-loving people, concerning your degree, hereby confer upon you the degree of Doctor of War, Chairman of Tyranny, and Fellow of World Reaction."

　　英国工人送给邱吉尔的“学位”
    （陈戈华译自六月十五日英文版“争取持久和平与人民民主报”）
    五月十九日，正值邱吉尔先生接受利物浦大学法学博士的名誉学位，该市两千群众集会，给了这位战贩头子一通特别电信。
    且看该电片断：“你的履历是无间地与世界各国工人作对，而今天你又领导世界各处最反动的同伙企图使全球陷入第三次世界大战……。我们，爱好和平人民底真正代表者，论及你的学位，谨授以战争博士，暴虐会长兼世界反动会友。”
