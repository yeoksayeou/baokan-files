Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th—The U.S. government's shameless persecution of American Communist leaders Dennis and ten others with prison sentences and fines has aroused widespread anger among the Chinese people. People from various democratic parties in the capital have strongly condemned it. Zhang Bojun said: This perverse action by the U.S. government shows its further slide into fascism and is a harbinger of the approaching demise of reactionary American monopoly capitalism's culture and politics. We protest this barbaric act and support the American people in actively stopping this reactionary measure by the U.S. government and swiftly restoring the freedom of the eleven American Communist leaders.
Li Dequan said: I have lived in the United States, visited their courts, and seen their trials. I feel that the American trials are entirely controlled by the running dogs of American monopoly capitalists, and there is no right or justice to speak of. Therefore, there is no need to be surprised at this verdict. This is the inevitable result of their reactionary political development.
Tan Pingshan said: This shameless act has aroused the righteous indignation of the people of the world, and the anti-U.S. imperialist tide has risen to a very high level because the people of the world and the American people have aligned interests. The barbaric and unreasonable verdict of the U.S. imperialist court is only enough to expose the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism, only enough to show that the U.S. rulers are approaching the brink of collapse and have to make this desperate struggle of a dying man, and even more enough to prove the inevitable trend of the bankruptcy of the old bourgeois democracy.
Cai Tingkai said: This verdict has completely exposed the mask of their so-called democracy, and what they are practicing has become completely fascist law. I feel that democratic people all over the world should unite and vigorously support the burgeoning movement of the American people to rescue the American Communist leaders.
Shao Lizi said: Everyone's opinion is the same regarding the U.S. government's conviction of the American Communist leaders. I completely agree with the People's Daily editorial that "the American reactionaries will surely reap what they sow."
Luo Longji said: What the U.S. government has been boasting about all day long is the freedom of assembly and association. Political parties are guaranteed by their constitution, but this announcement is equivalent to announcing that the Communist Party is not allowed to exist. This shows what the old democracy is: nothing more than a tool for the bourgeoisie to exercise dictatorship and suppress the proletariat.

　　美帝迫害美共领袖　
    首都人士续抗议
    【新华社北京二十五日电】美国政府无耻地对美共领袖但尼斯等十一人以判处徒刑及罚金的迫害，引起中国人民的普遍愤怒。首都各民主党派人士纷纷严加斥责。章伯钧说：美国政府的这种倒行逆施，说明了它法西斯化的更进一步，也是美国独占资本主义反动文化、政治更接近灭亡的预兆。我们抗议这种野蛮行为，并支援美国人民积极制止美国政府这种反动措施，迅速恢复十一个美共领袖的自由。
    李德全说：我在美国住过，参观过他们的法庭，看过他们的审判，我感到美国的审判完全是美国独占资本家的走狗所包办，根本无是非公理可言，所以，对这次的判决，丝毫不必奇怪，这是他们反动政治发展的必然结果。
    谭平山说：这种无耻的举动，已激起全世界人民的义愤，反对美帝国主义怒潮已万分高涨了，因为全世界的人民与美国人民是利害一致的。美帝国主义法庭这种野蛮无理的判决，只足以暴露了美帝法西斯的阴谋，只足以说明着美国统治者日将接近崩溃边沿，不得不作这种日暮途穷，倒行逆施的拼命挣扎，更足以证明了资产阶级的旧民主主义破产的必然趋势。
    蔡廷锴说：这次判决，把他们假称民主的面幕完全揭开了，他所奉行的完全成了法西斯法律。我感到全世界民主人士都应该团结起来，大力支援美国人民所展开的如火如荼的营救美共领袖的运动。
    邵力子说：对美国政府对美共领袖的判罪，大家意见都是一样，我完全同意人民日报社论所说：“美国反动派必将自食其果”。
    罗隆基说：美国政府一天到晚所吹嘘的就是有集会结社的自由。政党是他们宪法所保障的，而这次的宣布却等于宣布了不许有共产党存在。这说明了旧民主是什么东西，不过是资产阶级独裁专政压迫无产阶级的工具而已。
