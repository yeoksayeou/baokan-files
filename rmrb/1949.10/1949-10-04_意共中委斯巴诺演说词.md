　　Speech by Spano, Member of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party
　　Comrades of New China, friends, brothers and sisters:

　　On behalf of the workers, peasants, and advanced intellectuals of Italy, on behalf of the millions of Italian people who support peace and the unity of all nations, and firmly oppose the war policies and civil war policies implemented by the running dogs of American imperialism in Italy, I extend my fraternal and warm greetings to the conference!

　　We know the situation in Italy: on one side stands a party and government that builds its power on the spiritual coercion and deception of the Catholic Church and is shamefully enslaved by the evil policies of American imperialism. —American imperialists, like the former Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese Emperor, are dreaming of ruling the world. On the other side are the Italian people, who, though most have not yet found the path they should take, do need freedom and peace. Today, the people at the top of American policy in Italy are the representatives who once cultivated fascist forces; and the vanguard of the people, who also took up arms to overthrow fascism and expel the Nazi invaders, stood with us for the most part during the liberation of our motherland. Therefore, we can quote the words of Comrade Togliatti, the leader of the Italian working people: "We will never allow Italy to become a base for imperialist war, a base for anti-Soviet war." So we say: We have the power to stop the war. In our country, the forces of peace are also stronger than the forces of war. The Italian people will never allow war against the Soviet Union, against the new democratic countries, or against New China.

　　Chinese comrades! The main enemy of the Italian people is the same as your enemy. Therefore, we Italians can fully recognize the significance of the great historical events that China has experienced. You led the struggle to victory, and in the fight against imperialism and its running dogs, you won the victory of the Chinese revolution, which is also the victory of the people of the world.

　　Chinese comrades: This is a major and valuable lesson for us and the people of all countries. You have taught us how to defend peace in a country oppressed by imperialism. You have taught us that, even in a semi-colonial country (China was such a country in the past, and Italy is becoming such a country), to defend peace, one must have power; to defend peace, one must crush and eliminate the forces of war. Now, the vast majority of the Italian working people understand these principles. All the Italian people will soon understand it, because fascism and its successors have not been able to destroy the most precious asset of our people: the spirit of internationalism.

　　The working people of Italy understand this, as can be seen from the great influence of the Chinese revolution in Italy, from their excitement at the heroic victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and from their respect and love for the leaders of the Chinese people. It is difficult for Italians to pronounce a Chinese name, but it is not difficult for Italian hearts to express their love for the people of New China. When the Italian working people talk about you, they always say, "Our people." Figures like Mao Zedong and Zhu De are as praised, respected, and loved in Italy as they are in China.

　　Comrades! I am fortunate to have been able to attend the Soviet Peace Conference in Moscow a month ago, and I am also fortunate to participate in the birth of the People's Republic of China and its government in Beijing. Today, I have the opportunity to participate in this grand Chinese Peace Conference. I think I am the only democrat who believes in democracy from a capitalist country attending this conference. Comrades! In Moscow, as here (although the situation is different, in the Soviet Union it is after victory, and in China it is before the complete victory over fascism), people are working, building, and dedicating their strength to the cause of freedom and peace. We have expressed our gratitude to the Soviet comrades. Thank you for what you have done for yourselves, for us, and for the people of all countries in the world. Together, you are working on the road pointed out by Lenin and Stalin, for peace and for the friendship of all nations. The friendship between your two great countries is a strong guarantee for the cause of peace. It affirms the victory that internationalism has won, the victory that the friendship of all working people has won, and the victory that all freedom-loving people of the world have won.

　　Chinese comrades! On behalf of the workers of Italy, I assure you that we will always stand with you in the struggle for world peace and freedom. We will strive to live up to your expectations.

　　Long live the unity, struggle, and victory of the forces of world peace!

　　Long live the friendship of the peoples of all countries!

　　Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!

　　Long live New China!

　　意共中委斯巴诺演说词
    【新华社北京三日电】意大利人民代表意共中央委员斯巴诺在中国保卫世界和平大会上演说词全文如下：新中国的同志们，朋友们，兄弟姊妹们：
    我代表意大利的工人，农民，先进的知识分子，我代表千百万，拥护和平和各国人民的团结，而坚决反对美帝国主义的走狗们在意大利执行战争政策、内战政策的意大利人民，向大会谨致兄弟的和热烈的敬礼！
    我们知道在意大利的情况：站在一方面的是把政权建筑在天主教会的精神强制和欺骗上，和可耻地受美帝国主义的罪恶政策奴役的那样一个政党和政府。——美帝国主义者是和过去的希特勒、墨索里尼和日本天皇一样，做着统治世界的迷梦的。在另一方面的，是意大利人民，固然其中大部分还没有找到应走的道路，但他们确实是需要自由与和平的。今天在意大利站在美国政策顶端的人们，就是曾经培养过法西斯势力的代表人物；而人民的先锋队，也是曾经手执武器进行过打倒法西斯和把纳碎侵略者驱逐出境的人，在解放我们的祖国时，绝大多数的人民是与我们站在一起的。因此，我们可以引用意大利劳动人民的领袖托格利亚蒂同志亲口说过的话：“我们决不允许意大利变成帝国主义战争的基地、反苏战争的基地。”所以我们说：我们有力量阻止战争。在我们的国家里，和平的力量也比战争的力量更强大。意大利人民绝不允许与苏联作战、与新民主国家作战、与新中国作战。
    中国的同志们！意大利人民的主要敌人，和你们的敌人是一样的。因此，我们意大利人，能充分认识到中国所经历的历史伟大事件的意义。你们把斗争引向了胜利，在与帝国主义及其走狗战斗中，也就是为全世界人民的战斗中，你们赢得了中国革命的胜利。
    中国的同志们：对于我们和各国人民，这都是一个重大而宝贵的指教。你们教给了我们怎样在一个受帝国主义压迫的国家里保卫和平。你们教给了我们，甚至在一个半殖民地的国家里（中国过去是这样一个国家，意大利也正在变成这样一个国家），为了保卫和平，就得自己有力量；为了保卫和平，就得粉碎和消灭战争的力量。现在，绝大部分的意大利劳动人民，已经懂得这些道理。全意大利人民不久就都会懂得它，因为法西斯主义及其继承人，并没有能够消灭我国人民最宝贵的财产：国际主义的精神。
    意大利的劳动人民是懂得这一点的，这可以从中国革命在意大利的影响之大而看出，可以从他们对中国人民解放军英勇的胜利如何兴奋，对中国人民的领袖们如何的敬爱而看出，意大利人的嘴里，说出一个中国人名，是困难的，但意大利人的心表示热爱新中国的人们却不是困难的。意大利的劳动人民说到你们的时候，他们总说：“咱们的人”。象毛泽东和朱德这些人物，在意大利也和在中国一样为人人所颂扬，受到崇敬和爱戴。
    同志们！我很幸运在一个月前在莫斯科能够参加苏联保卫和平大会之后，我又很幸运在北京参加中华人民共和国和政府的诞生。今天，我又有机会来此参加这盛大的中国保卫世界和平大会。我想，我是参加这会唯一的、资本主义国家的信仰民主的人。同志们！在莫斯科，象在这里一样（情况虽然不同，在苏联是胜利后，在中国还在对法西斯主义将要完全胜利之前），人们工作着，建设着，把自己的力量献给自由与和平的工作。我们曾经向苏联的同志们表示感谢。感谢你们为你们自己，和为我们，也是为全世界各国人民所做的事业。你们共同在列宁和斯大林所指出的大路上，为了和平与为了各国人民的友爱而工作。你们两个大国的友好，是对于和平事业强有力的保证。它确定了国际主义已经获得的胜利，一切劳动人民的友爱已经获得的胜利和全世界一切爱好自由的人民已经获得的胜利。
    中国的同志们！我代表意大利的工人，谨向你们保证，在为世界和平与自由的斗争中，我们永远和你们站在一起。我们要努力做到决不辜负你们。
    世界和平力量团结战斗胜利万岁！
    各国人民友爱万岁！
    中苏友好万岁！
    新中国万岁！
