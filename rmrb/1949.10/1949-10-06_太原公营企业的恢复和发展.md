　　The Recovery and Development of Taiyuan's Public Enterprises
    Taiyuan is one of North China's heavy industrial bases, and it has been four months since its liberation. The work of restoring and rebuilding Taiyuan's industry is actively underway. The brave and hardworking workers of Taiyuan, under the leadership of the Party, defeated the enemy and immediately shifted their strength to build the country's industry. Their efforts are admirable.
    Taiyuan's industry is quite substantial, with the Northwest Steel Plant capable of producing 1,500 tons of iron and 1,600 tons of steel per month, the Northwest Cement Plant producing 3,000 tons of cement per month, the Northwest Locomotive Plant capable of repairing and manufacturing 30 locomotives and 100 passenger and freight cars per month, and the rich coal mines of Dongshan, Xishan, and Fujiatan. The Northwest Coal Mine alone, with its first and fourth plants, can produce more than 43,000 tons of coal per month. In addition, there are the Northwest Chemical Plant, the Electrochemical Plant, the Northwest Paper Mill, the Northwest Woolen Mill, the Taiyuan Weaving Mill, match factories, flour mills, leather factories, printing factories, lumber factories, oil and fertilizer plants... etc. These are all the crystallization of the blood and sweat of the people of Shanxi over the decades, and now they have finally returned to the people. The workers have changed from the status of slaves to the masters of the factories, and their production enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly enhanced. In the four months since liberation, most factories have overcome the difficulties left behind by the destruction and looting of the Yan Xishan bandits and have quickly realized their production recovery plans. Some factories have even exceeded their pre-liberation production levels. The nationally renowned Northwest Steel Plant resumed work the day after the liberation of Taiyuan. Now, the iron output of the plant's No. 1 furnace has exceeded three times the pre-liberation level, and the monthly steel output has broken the record of 48 furnaces. The rolling steel section of the plant has painstakingly researched and successfully trial-rolled "17 kg" steel rails. Steel rails, which could not be produced during the Japanese occupation, can now be produced. This is a major achievement for the plant and will have a significant impact on the industrial construction of the North China region. Before liberation, each pulverizer in the Northwest Cement Plant produced an average of 3.7 tons per hour, which has now increased to 5.12 tons. In the Northwest Coal Mine's first plant, workers worked 12 hours a day under Yan Xishan's rule. Now it has been changed to 9 hours a day. With the same working conditions and number of people, the daily coal production is now 37 tons more than before liberation. Railway workers at the Taiyuan Locomotive Depot have also greatly demonstrated their creativity after liberation, and their technology has surpassed the pre-war level. In the past, the depot could not perform Class A overhauls on locomotives, but in May of this year, it has already completed Class A overhauls on seven locomotives. The Class B overhaul of locomotives used to take 25 workdays before liberation, but now it only takes 14 workdays.
    The achievement of these results is primarily due to the city's firm implementation of the correct policy of relying on the working class in the recovery and development of production. This has enabled the workers to realize that they are the masters of the enterprises, thereby enhancing their class consciousness and consciously and actively engaging in production. The workers of the Northwest Coal Mine's first plant were beaten and abused under Yan Xishan's rule, and often went hungry. At that time, there was a popular saying among the workers: "Issued bran flour, given bean cakes, not enough to eat, dawdling on the job, two days of work done in three, taking a dump at 2:30." After liberation, the situation was completely different. The kiln workers in the civil engineering department of the plant's engineering section used to make 300 blanks per person in 10 hours before liberation, but now they make 629 blanks per person in 10 hours, more than double the previous amount. The workers in the repair shop of the electromechanical section received the task of manufacturing 30 coal cars in early June. Because the factory did not have iron materials, the workers automatically found scrap iron from the pile of scrap iron as raw materials, saving raw materials worth 7,591 catties of millet. It was originally planned to be completed in 15 days, but it was completed in 10 days. In the Northwest Printing Plant's plate-making department, the full assembly of full-page plates used to require two people to complete in one day; after liberation, one person can complete it in seven hours. Technician Li Ze said: "We are liberated and have become the masters of the factory. Everyone's enthusiasm has increased. When we have work to do, we don't need anyone to urge us, we just do it!" On the wall of a workshop in the Northwest Coal Mine's first plant, there is a poem written: "Yesterday (referring to Yan Xishan's rule) tears filled our eyes, today we are masters. We eat our fill all day and work hard, we will settle accounts with Yan Xishan." Fully developing democracy, with the factory and workers jointly formulating production plans, so that all employees take the initiative to grasp the plan and consciously carry out production, is also one of the reasons for the rapid recovery and development of production. When the Taiyuan Industrial Chemical Company formulated its production plan for July, it first mobilized all employees to discuss it together and made a resolution. The workers consciously felt that they were implementing the plan they had stipulated in production, and their production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly enhanced. The original plan for July was to produce 16,000 kg of caustic soda, 20,000 kg of bleaching powder, 300 kg of potassium chlorate, and 10,000 cubic meters of oxygen. The actual production was 21,616 kg of caustic soda, 25,600 kg of bleaching powder, 400.5 kg of potassium chlorate, and 14,029 cubic meters of oxygen. When the Taiyuan Flour Company's second plant formulated its production plan, it was discussed by all the technical personnel and employees, so that the employees could consciously grasp the production tasks. As a result, the July production of No. 75 general-purpose flour exceeded the plan by 405 bags, and No. 82 corn flour exceeded the plan by 57 bags.
    The Taiyuan Military Control Commission pays great attention to the welfare of the workers, protects the lives and health of the employees. As soon as the Military Control Commission entered the city, it allocated 600,000 catties of relief grain to urgently relieve the dying workers and poor citizens. Each factory also generally pre-borrowed several days' wages, creating possible and favorable conditions for the resumption of work. In late May, the Military Control Commission allocated another 900,000 catties of grain to continue relief, benefiting more than 35,000 employees (including the unemployed). On the third day of the liberation of Taiyuan, the Taiyuan Office of the North China Federation of Trade Unions cooperated with the Trading Company to establish a distribution station in the north of the city, supplying employees of eleven major factories with a large amount of oil, salt, and grain at prices 5 to 20 percent lower than the market price. Now, eight employee consumer cooperatives have been established in the city, with more than 26,000 members. In order to ensure the health of the workers, the Military Control Commission changed the Gongji Hospital into an employee hospital; the Northwest Hospital of the original Yan Xishan bandits was also merged into one place, serving exclusively for the employees. By the end of July, a total of 2,101 employees had been cured. Twelve clinics, thirty-one cafeterias, and forty-six bathhouses have been successively established in each factory. Special welfare for female workers has also been appropriately valued, and some factories have been equipped with breastfeeding rooms, female bathhouses, and nurseries.

　　太原公营企业的恢复和发展
    太原是华北重工业基地之一，解放已经四个月了。恢复和重建太原工业的工作，正在积极进行中。勇敢、勤劳的太原工人，在党的领导下打败了敌人，马上转移自己的力量，建设祖国的工业，他们的努力是使人钦佩的。
    太原的工业颇具规模，有月产生铁一千五百吨、钢一千六百吨的西北炼钢厂，有月产洋灰三千吨的西北洋灰厂，有每月修造机车三十辆、客货车一百辆的西北机车厂，有蕴藏丰富的东山、西山、富家滩煤矿，仅西北煤矿第一、第四两厂每月即可产煤四万三千多吨；此外有西北化学厂、电化厂、西北造纸厂、西北毛织厂、太原织造厂、火柴厂、面粉厂、皮革厂、印刷厂、木料厂、油肥厂……等，这些都是几十年来山西人民血汗的结晶，现在终于复归人民所有。职工从奴隶的地位变成了工厂的主人，生产热情空前提高。在解放后的四个月中，大部工厂都战胜了因阎匪破坏、抢掠而遗留的困难，迅速实现了恢复生产的计划。若干工厂并已超过了解放前的生产水平。全国闻名的西北炼钢厂，在太原解放后的第二天即行复工，现在该厂第一号熔炉的出铁量已经超过解放前的三倍，每月出钢已突破四十八炉的纪录。该厂碾钢科全体职工苦心钻研，试碾“十七公斤”钢轨业已成功。在日寇占领时期不能生产的钢轨，现在能够生产了。这是该厂的重大创造，对华北区的工业建设，也将产生很大的影响。在解放以前，西北洋灰厂每部粉末机每小时平均生产三点七吨，现已增至五点一二吨。西北煤矿第一厂在阎匪统治时期，每日工作十二小时，现在改为每日工作九小时，工作条件和人数相同，现在每天比解放前增产煤三十七吨。太原机务段铁路员工在解放后也大大发挥了自己的创造性，他们的技术已超过了战前水平。过去该段不能甲级检修机车，今年五月份已经甲检七辆，乙级检修机车解放前用二十五个工，现在仅用十四个工。
    这些成绩的取得，首先是由于该市在恢复发展生产中，坚决执行了依靠工人阶级的正确方针，这样就使得工人们认识到自己是企业的主人，从而提高了阶级觉悟，自觉自动的去积极生产。西北煤矿第一厂工人，在阎匪统治时挨打受气，经常饿肚子，当时工人中流行着一句话：“发麸面，给豆饼，吃不饱肚子磨洋工，两天的活三天干，拉一回屎两点半。”解放后，情况完全不同了。该厂工程课土木建筑系扣坯子的窑工，解放前每人十小时扣坯子三百个，解放后每人十小时扣坯子六百二十九个，比以前增加了一倍多。机电课修车房工人，六月初接受了制造炭车三十辆的任务，因厂里没有铁料，工人们自动从烂铁堆里找废铁作原料，节省原料共值小米七千五百九十一斤。原计划十五天完成，结果十天就完成了。西北印刷厂制版系全装整开版，解放前需两个人一天完成；解放后一个人七小时就完成了。技工李泽说：“我们解放了，成了工厂的主人翁，大家的心劲提高了，有了活用不着人催，自己就干起来啦！”在西北煤矿一厂一个工房的墙上写着这样一首诗：“昨日（指阎匪统治时）泪满襟，今日当主人。满食终日多劳动，捉住阎匪要算帐。”充分发扬民主，厂方和工人共同订定生产计划，使全厂职工主动掌握计划，自觉进行生产。也是能够迅速恢复与发展生产的原因之一。太原工业化学公司在订定七月份生产计划时，先发动全体职工共同讨论，作出决议，工人们在生产中自觉到这是执行自己规定的计划，生产情绪空前提高。原计划七月份生产苛性曹达一万六千公斤，漂白粉二万公斤，氯酸钾三百公斤，氧气一万公秉，实产苛性曹达二万一千六百十六公斤，漂白粉二万五千六百公斤，氯酸钾四百零一点五公斤，氧气一万四千零二十九公秉。太原面粉公司第二厂拟订生产计划时，都经过全厂技术人员和职工讨论，使职工能够自觉地掌握生产任务，结果七月份生产七五通粉超过计划四百零五袋，八二玉茭粉超过计划五十七袋。
    太原军管会十分注意工人的福利事业，保障职工的生活和健康，军管会刚入城就拨了六十万斤救济粮，急赈奄奄待毙的工人和贫苦市民，各厂又普遍预借数日工资，给复工造成可能与有利的条件。五月下旬军管会又拨了九十万斤粮食继续救济，受惠的职工（连失业者在内）达三万五千余人。太原解放第三日，华北总工会太原办事处即协同贸易公司在城北成立配售站，以低于市价百分之五至二十的价格，供给十一个主要工厂的职工以大批油盐粮食。现在全市已成立八个职工消费合作社，社员达二万六千余人。军管会为了保证工人健康，改共济医院为职工医院；将原阎匪之西北医院也并到一处，专为职工服务，至七月底止，共治愈职工二千一百零一人。各工厂已次第建立医疗所十二个，食堂三十一个，澡塘四十六个。对于女工的特殊福利也已适当的重视，有些工厂已设备了喂奶室、女澡塘、托儿所等。
