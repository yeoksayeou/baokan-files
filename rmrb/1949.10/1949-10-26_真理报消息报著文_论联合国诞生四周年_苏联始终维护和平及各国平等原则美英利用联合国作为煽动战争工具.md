Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 25th: TASS Moscow reports: October 24th marks the fourth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Several Moscow newspapers have published articles commenting on this day.

    The *People's Daily*'s international commentary, entitled "Friends and Enemies of the United Nations," states: "The Soviet Union, as a signatory to the UN Charter, believes that the United Nations is a tool to ensure peace and peaceful cooperation among nations. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the strength of this international organization lies in the fact that it is established on the principle of equality among nations, rather than on the principle of some nations ruling others. If the United Nations can victoriously uphold the principle of equality in the future, it will undoubtedly play a significant positive role in ensuring universal peace and security. The Soviet Union's policy has consistently striven to ensure that the United Nations has the opportunity to achieve this vital task. However, the countries of the Anglo-American bloc are pursuing an extremely opposite course. Their aim is to undermine the United Nations and turn it into a blind tool of the American and British ruling groups."

    The *Guangming Daily* comments: "The Soviet Union can proudly declare to peace-loving people of all countries that it has consistently and fully utilized its international prestige and all its strength to promote the cause of peace and security for all peoples, thereby enabling this international organization to serve the lofty purpose stipulated in the Charter. The Soviet Union has consistently fought to strengthen the United Nations as a tool for peace and for defending the sovereignty of peace-loving nations, and to strengthen the unity and harmony among the major powers. Without such harmony and unity, any effective activity of the United Nations is impossible. The Soviet Union is not isolated in its struggle to uphold peace, security, and consolidate the prestige of this international organization. Within the United Nations, it has always been supported by the representatives of the people's democratic countries— staunch fighters for universal peace. At the same time, outside the United Nations, the Soviet Union has the firm support of millions of people who are striving to avoid the outbreak of new wars and to promptly stop the activities of warmongers. The Soviet Union will forever uphold the principles of the UN Charter, especially the principle of unanimity among the five permanent members of the Security Council—the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and China. It firmly opposes the attempts by the Anglo-American bloc to turn the United Nations into a weapon to implement their aggressive plans aimed at establishing world hegemony. Especially in the past year, the entire policy pursued by the Anglo-American bloc has been aimed at undermining the main pillars of the United Nations. Under the guise of false assurances of supporting the United Nations, the US and British governments are engaging in deceptive dealings that violate and even oppose the United Nations. The most important actions in this policy of undermining the United Nations are the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization supported by the United States and Britain, and the Marshall Plan—a plan to enslave the people of Western European countries. The current fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York provides more examples of the Anglo-American bloc desperately undermining the foundations of the United Nations and using this body as a smokescreen to prepare for a new world war. The opponents of the United Nations clearly overestimate their own strength and underestimate the strength of the peace camp, led by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, which opposes the war-mongering policies pursued by the Anglo-American ruling groups. Peace-loving people of all countries believe that, despite the destructive efforts of the warmongers, the United Nations remains an important tool for maintaining peace and international security."

    苏联始终维护和平及各国平等原则美英利用联合国作为煽动战争工具
    【新华社北京二十五日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：十月二十四日是联合国诞生的四周年纪念日，莫斯科若干报纸都撰文评论这个日子。
    真理报的国际述评以“联合国的朋友与敌人”为题写道：“身为联合国宪章签字国的苏联认为联合国是用以保证和平与各国间和平合作的工具。斯大林同志指出，这个国际组织的力量，在于它是按照各国平等的原则，而不是按照某些国家统治其他国家的原则建立的。假若联合国将来胜利地维护了平等的原则，那末它无疑地将在保证普遍和平与安全上起很大的积极作用。苏联的政策始终如一地力求保证联合国有实现这一至要任务的机会。英美集团的国家却奉行着极端相反的方针，它们的目的是破坏联合国，并把它变成美国和英国统治集团的盲目的工具。”
    消息报评论说：“苏联能够骄傲地向全世界爱好和平的各国人民公开宣布：它一贯充分利用它的国际威信和它所有的力量，来促进各国人民的和平与安全的事业，从而使这个国际组织能为宪章所规定的这一崇高目的而服务。苏联始终如一地进行斗争，以加强联合国作为和平与保卫爱好和平各国人民主权的工具和加强大国间的一致与和谐。如果没有这种和谐一致，联合国的任何有效活动都是不可能的。苏联在拥护和平、安全和巩固这个国际组织的威信的斗争中，并不是孤立的。在联合国中，它始终受到人民民主国家代表——拥护普遍和平的坚强战士的支持，同时在联合国以外，苏联拥有千百万人士的坚决支持，他们竭力要求避免新战争爆发和及时制止战争贩子的活动。苏联永远维护联合国宪章的原则，首先是安理会五常任理事国——苏美英法中——一致的原则。它坚决反对英美集团的企图，它们想把联合国变成执行它们旨在建立世界霸权的侵略计划的武器。特别是去年一年内，英美集团所遵循的整个政策，都是旨在破坏联合国的主要支柱。美国和英国政府在支持联合国的虚伪保证的面具之下，进行欺骗和违背联合国的勾当，甚至反对它。在这种破坏联合国的政策中，最重要的行动就是美国和英国所支持的侵略性的北大西洋侵略联盟，以及马歇尔计划——奴役西欧各国人民的计划。目前纽约联合国大会的第四届会议，提供了英美集团拼命破坏联合国基础，并利用这个机构为烟幕，从事准备新的世界战争的更多例子。联合国的反对者显然过高估计了他们自己的力量，而过低估计了以苏联和人民民主国家为首的反对美英统治集团所奉行的煽动战争政策的和平阵营的力量。爱好和平的各国人民相信，尽管有战贩们的破坏的努力，联合国仍是保持和平与国际安全的重要工具。”
