Speaking of the two of them going to the Big Three's house, they ran into Xi Lu bringing a bottle of wine to Big Three. Big Three had fried two eggs himself and was drinking alone. Willow Ditch's family, like a gust of wind, ran to Big Three, snatched a cup of wine, downed it in one gulp, ate two mouthfuls of eggs, and said, "Uncle Big Three! In terms of age, I'm older than you, so I can say a thing or two! You see, it's often said that smoking and drinking can't be separated from friends, and you've seen the world, so why are you drinking all alone at this time? Are you stingy, or do you have something on your mind?" Little Foreign Devil said, "Don't listen to her rotten bi@① mouth talking nonsense! Uncle Big Three, her mouth is so greedy that she wants to drink urine like wine. She's complaining that you didn't invite her!" Big Three laughed and quickly filled another cup of wine for Willow Ditch's family, handing it over, saying, "Drink, there's plenty!" Willow Ditch's family took it and downed it in one gulp, pointing at Little Foreign Devil, "Look, this is poured to me by Uncle Big Three himself! If you don't drink, then eat the fried eggs! Uncle Big Three doesn't stand on ceremony, come on!" As she spoke, Willow Ditch's family turned around, holding up the fried eggs in one hand and chopsticks in the other, and sent it directly to Little Foreign Devil's mouth, saying, "Eat it! I'll feed you! Don't be embarrassed!" The two of them started fighting and laughing. Big Three lay on the bed, watching them laugh.

After a while, Willow Ditch's family conceded first, pretending to glare and said, "Little Foreign Devil, stop making noise! We should talk about something serious! Aren't you afraid of making Uncle Big Three angry?" Big Three laughed again, sat up, and asked them to sit down and drink water. Little Foreign Devil panted for breath, cursed Willow Ditch's family a couple of times, then sat down on the edge of the bed and started talking to Big Three seriously.

Little Foreign Devil said, "Uncle Big Three! Seriously speaking, I think you should save a little. Eating isn't easy these days, so eat a little less thick porridge and add some melons and vegetables. You should save something for later!"

Big Three laughed and said, "Didn't you say: living to be a hundred is still just a lifetime? Every day you live is half a day less, so what's the point of saving it!"

Willow Ditch's family said, "Wouldn't it be nice to save some to treat Little Foreign Devil to a couple of meals?"

Little Foreign Devil pursed his lips at Willow Ditch's family and said, "I've never seen such an indecent old woman! Do you think you can please people just because you have a clever mouth?" Willow Ditch's family quickly reached out with her dry tobacco pipe towards Little Foreign Devil. Little Foreign Devil pushed her away while very seriously saying to Big Three, "I mean well! For example, you're almost forty, so you should save some money and try to find a family! Otherwise, if you die alone, there won't even be anyone to burn paper money and offer sacrifices, and you don't have any relatives!"

Hearing this, Willow Ditch's family quickly threw down her dry tobacco pipe and clapped her hands, saying, "That's right! That's really the right thing to say! I've been saying that in my heart for a long time!" As she spoke, she saw a pile of unwashed dirty clothes beside the bedding on the bed, pointed at it, and said, "Look! A single man, not to mention mixing mud, lighting a fire, and cooking, even mending clothes and washing clothes is so difficult! Alas! My heart is soft, and it's really pitiful to watch! I'll wash them for you!" She climbed onto the bed and picked up the pile of dirty clothes. She accidentally saw a half-new silk pair of pants under the clothes, so she quickly dropped the clothes, picked up the silk pair of pants, turned it over and looked at it carefully, jumped off the bed and shouted, "Oh! This silk pair of pants, I'm afraid no one in our village has worn it except Old Man Ju Bao! This is really bright and shiny. Wearing this, people will be young again! The body will be light! When the wind blows, it floats, really overly pretty! I'll call people to come and see!" As she spoke, she walked out, shouting for Tian Lu's wife to come and see. Big Three quickly jumped off the bed to stop her and tried to snatch the pants back, but she wouldn't let him, raising the pants high, and said to Little Foreign Devil, "Don't you want to see it and broaden your horizons? Look at this! Oh! This doesn't look like it was machine-stitched, it must have been sewn stitch by stitch! Look at this good needlework! Ah! Uncle Big Three," she turned around and laughed, "This must have been sewn by a beautiful woman for you! No wonder you don't mention getting a family! You must have someone! Little Foreign Devil! Look at this needlework, our aunt must wear a shining outfit, put on rouge and powder, and wear flowers, the big sister from Taiyuan Prefecture! Uncle Big Three! See if I guessed right?" Big Three quickly snatched the pants back, lowered his head and sat on the edge of the bed, his face flushed. It turned out that Willow Ditch's family was right: Big Three had made friends with a very close woman in the West Mountain of the Prefecture, but later a certain official bought that woman. The woman couldn't bear to leave him. Before leaving, she secretly sewed this silk pair of pants for him with tears. After that, he carried it with him. When he had nothing to do, he would take it out and look at it, as if he had seen that woman. Besides that, he didn't want to listen to anyone else talking about finding a family. He was always thinking about that woman. Only now that he suddenly saw that Bai Quan's family looked almost like his sweetheart, he felt a little moved. But when it came to talking about getting a wife, he still didn't mean anything.

Willow Ditch's family didn't know Big Three's thoughts. She was talking happily and had drunk a little wine, her face flushed, and she kept saying, "People from outside can't be trusted, Uncle Big Three! Don't think you have gold teeth and wear a top hat, you're living in the village now, you should find someone from your hometown! As long as you agree, Little Foreign Devil and I promise to run our legs off and talk until our mouths are dry, to find you a good one, guaranteed to be more beautiful than Bai Quan's family, and guaranteed to not cost much money!" Big Three still lowered his head and smiled, not saying anything. Only when Willow Ditch's family mentioned Bai Quan's family did his face flush a little. Little Foreign Devil said, "Willow Ditch's family, look at your @mouth! Our Uncle Big Three isn't someone who fools around! You should talk seriously!" Willow Ditch's family said, "Aren't I saying serious things! Uncle Big Three, in the blink of an eye, the weather is getting cold again! Don't think the blankets you're sleeping under are thick, but they can't compare to a couple being skin to skin! Haven't you tasted that flavor?" Little Foreign Devil pursed his lips and cursed, "Bah! Such an old thing is so flirtatious. Don't you want your @face anymore?" Willow Ditch's family laughed alone. Little Foreign Devil grabbed Big Three's arm and seriously said some whispers. Big Three nodded. Little Foreign Devil walked out, saying, "Think about it! Give me a message soon!" Willow Ditch's family also picked up Big Three's pile of dirty clothes and walked out, saying, "I'll wash these clothes for you. I won't let you take the clothes back until I get a definite answer from you!" Big Three reluctantly smiled, "Okay!" and sent the two of them away.

    却说他二人相跟着去到大三家，正碰上喜禄送了大三一瓶酒，大三自己炒了两个鸡蛋，一个人在喝。柳沟家一进门，就象一阵风，跑到大三跟前，抢过一盅酒一嘴干了，又吃了两嘴鸡蛋，说道：“大三叔！论年岁我可比你大，我也能说说你！你看，常说烟酒不离朋友，你也是见过世面的，怎么这会孤孤单单一个人就喝开啦？你倒是小气啊，还是有什么心事？”小洋鬼道：“可别听她那烂ｂī＠①嘴瞎说八道！大三叔，她嘴馋得见了尿也想当酒喝的，她是嫌你没请她哩！”大三笑着，忙给柳沟家又满了一盅酒，递过去道：“喝吧，有的是！”柳沟家接过来又一口干了，指着小洋鬼道：“你看，这可是大三叔亲手敬我喝的！你不喝酒嘛，想吃炒鸡子就吃吧！大三叔不见外的，来呀！”说着，柳沟家背转身，一手端起炒鸡蛋，一手拿着筷子，直送到小洋鬼嘴边，一边说：“吃吧！我喂你！不要不好意思嘛！”两人动手动脚吵笑开了，大三就往炕上一躺，瞅着两人笑。
    一会，柳沟家先让步，假意瞪着眼说道：“小洋鬼别一个劲吵闹啦！咱来了就该说个正经的嘛！你也不怕大三叔生气？”大三又哈哈笑着坐起来，招呼他二人坐下喝水。小洋鬼喘了喘气，骂了柳沟家两句，才坐到炕沿边，正正经经地对大三说开了话。
    小洋鬼说：“大三叔！说正经的，我看你这光景也该省着点。这如今吃饭不容易，你少吃两顿稠的，添点瓜瓜菜菜，该留个后手啊！”
    大三笑道：“你不是说过：人活百岁也是一辈子么？过一天少俩半天，省它干球哩！”
    柳沟家道：“省着点请小洋鬼吃两顿不好么？”
    小洋鬼对柳沟家嘴一噘道：“没见你那老不正经的！你倚着你那嘴巧，就能逗人欢喜么？”柳沟家忙伸出旱烟袋往小洋鬼跟前窜，小洋鬼一边推开她，一边很正经地对大三道：“我可是好意！好比说，你也快四十啦，也该省着点，想法寻个家口啦！要不，单蹦个死了连个烧纸上坟的人也没有，你又没个亲人的！”
    柳沟家听了这话，忙把旱烟袋一丢，拍着巴掌道：“对！这才真是正经的！我心眼里早就这么说哩！”说到这里，她看见炕上铺盖边一堆没洗的脏衣裳，就指着那说：“你看！一个单蹦个男人，不要说和泥生火做饭，连补个衣服洗个衣裳也多遭难啊！唉！我这人心软，看着真可怜哩！我给你洗洗吧！”她一边就爬上炕去，把那堆脏衣裳抱起来，隙见衣裳下面有一条半新的绸裤，就忙丢了衣裳，拿着绸裤翻过来掉过去细细看了一遍，跳下炕嚷道：“啊哟！这绸裤咱村除了聚宝老人家，怕谁也没穿过哩！这才真是明光闪亮，穿上这，人也年青啦！身子也轻啦！风一刮，飘呀飘地，可是过余的漂亮哩！我叫人们看看去！”说着，她就往外走，一边嚷着叫天禄他老婆快来看；大三忙跳下炕止住她，并要抢回裤子去；她不让，隙把裤子举得高高地，对小洋鬼道：“你不看看开开眼界么？看这！哟！这不象机器扎的，准是一针针缝下的哩！看这好针脚！啊！大三叔，”她回过头来笑道：“这准是个漂亮女人给你缝的吧！怪难你也不提娶家口的事！你准是有了吧！小洋鬼！看这针线营生，咱婶子准是穿一身雷光闪闪，搽脂打粉戴花，太原府的大姐姐哩！大三叔！你看我没猜错吧？”大三忙抢过裤子来，低头坐上炕沿，红了脸。原来柳沟家的确没走眼：大三在府西山是交结了一个很相好的女人，但后来邻近一个什么官把那女人买走了，女人舍不得他，临走前就流着眼泪，偷偷给他缝了这条绸裤，以后他就随身带着，没事时拿出来看看，就象见了那个女人，此外别人再跟他说合女人家口的，他是连听也不愿听，他总还是想着那个女人，只在现在，他忽然见到白泉家正和他那相好的女人长得差不多，他才动动心，不过说到说媳妇的事，他还是没什么意思。
    柳沟家不知道大三的心事，她正说得高兴，又喝了点酒，脸红红地，就一个劲说道：“外头的靠不住，大三叔！甭看你镶金牙戴礼帽的，这会你也在村里住下啦，你还是寻个本乡本土的吧！只要你答应，我跟小洋鬼保准跑断腿说破嘴，给你寻个好好的，保准比白泉家还漂亮，还保准花钱不多！”大三还是低着脑袋笑，不说什么，只在柳沟家说到白泉家的时候，他的脸红了一下；小洋鬼却说：“柳沟家，看你那＠嘴！咱大三叔又不是个耍耍笑笑的人！你正正经经说说嘛！”柳沟家道：“我这不都是正经话么！大三叔，一转眼天又冷啦！别看你铺的盖的厚，可总顶不住两口子肉靠肉啊！你没尝过那滋味？”小洋鬼嘴一翘，骂道：“呸！个老货也这么骚搭搭的，你还要你那＠脸不？”柳沟家一个人“吃吃”笑去了，小洋鬼就抓住大三的胳膊，古板正经地说了些什么悄悄话，只见大三点了点头，小洋鬼就一边往外走，一边说：“你思谋思谋吧！早些给我个讯！”柳沟家也抱起大三那堆脏衣裳，往外走着说：“这衣裳我给你洗洗，赶你有了准讯，才许你取衣裳去！”大三勉强笑道：“行！”就送二人走了。
