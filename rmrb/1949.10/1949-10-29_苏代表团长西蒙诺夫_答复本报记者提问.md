The Head of the Soviet Delegation, Simonov, Answers Questions from Our Newspaper's Reporter

[Our Newspaper News] The Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation held a press conference the day before yesterday (the 27th). While issuing a statement, the head of the delegation, Simonov, answered six questions raised by our newspaper's reporter. These questions were submitted in writing by our newspaper's reporter on the 25th. The questions and answers are as follows:

Question: The Chinese people warmly welcome the Soviet delegation. We would like to hear the impressions of the Soviet delegation during their stopovers on the way to our capital, in the capital, and in Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, and Tianjin.

Answer: We have already answered the main part of this question in our statement. Now I will only add a few more points. In addition to the cities mentioned in the question, we also visited Jinan on our way back to Beijing. The loving atmosphere of the working people of Jinan, especially the working class, towards the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, gave us an unusually deep impression. I would also like to add that when we return from Beijing to our country, we will be happy to stop in Shenyang and meet with the workers and intellectuals there. When we came from the Soviet Union, the working people of Shenyang warmly welcomed us. However, because we had to rush to Beijing to participate in the national holiday of October 1st, we only stayed in Shenyang for a few hours. We will soon fill this gap in our journey.

Question: In your opinion, what more should our newspapers do to strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship and to help express your friendship through newspapers?

Answer: As far as we know, Chinese newspapers have published news of our delegation's arrival in people's democratic China with great friendly concern. Many of the speeches of the members of our delegation have been published in full or in detailed summaries in Chinese newspapers. Therefore, the Chinese newspapers themselves have already answered this question. The newspapers have already introduced to readers in cities and villages we have not reached, information about life and cultural construction in the Soviet Union contained in our talks. Now we only need the friendly help of Chinese newspapers to convey our warmest friendly greetings and our most sincere wishes for the greatest achievements in the cause of cultural construction in New China to countless friends in cities and villages we have not had time to visit.

Question: Due to your arrival in China, the friendship between China and the Soviet Union has become even closer. In order to further enhance the friendship between our two great countries, what should the people of the two countries prepare to do in the future?

Answer: After returning to the Soviet Union, the Soviet cultural workers delegation plans to undertake three tasks in order to further strengthen cultural ties with China: First, in many lectures and reports, we will tell our compatriots in detail about everything we have seen in New China, especially the outstanding achievements of the Chinese people in the field of cultural construction. Second, to publish the same in Soviet newspapers. Third, we will report to the Soviet social and cultural organizations that sent us as representatives about the questions raised by our Chinese friends and the concern of our Chinese friends for the experience of new social construction in the Soviet Union, as well as the specific requests of our Chinese friends regarding the actual situation of the work of Soviet cultural organizations. This is what we want to do when we return to our country. As for the other question, that is, what kind of work should our Chinese friends develop to strengthen the friendship between our two peoples—in our opinion, and mainly due to our observations, our Chinese friends already know very well what to do to consolidate the friendship between our two peoples, without any suggestions from us, and have already done a lot.

Question: Please tell us about your impressions of China's cultural and artistic work since you came to China. At the same time, please talk about your opinions on future cultural and artistic exchanges between our two great countries of China and the Soviet Union.

Answer: This question is essentially two questions. The first question has already been answered a lot in our speeches. But I would like to add a few more words. We saw exhibitions of Chinese paintings, sculptures, and prints in Beijing; we visited an art school exhibition in Nanjing; we have seen many Chinese theater troupes and band groups; we have seen performances of Chinese new dramas and classical dramas; and we have also visited performances by students of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts and the youth groups who recently returned from Budapest. It is difficult for us to express the feelings of each of us here, but due to what we saw of the performance of Chinese art, we received a huge force and an outstanding talent impression. We have no doubt that by combining the best models of classical heritage and the creations of the Chinese people, with all the art produced by the modern life of the liberated Chinese people every day and every hour, then Chinese art will reach an unusually prosperous period. The fact that Chinese artists are doing their best to serve the people, and that they are expanding their connection with the people day by day, is already solid evidence of this.

The second part of this question is about the exchange of experience. Yesterday, the Soviet delegation, in a three-hour discussion with representatives of the Cultural and Education Committee of the Government Administration Council headed by Guo Moruo, talked about this issue. Regarding our mutual exchange of experience, we believe that it would be more appropriate to convey the entire record of our conversation about the exchange of experience yesterday to our Chinese friends so that they can review and use these records themselves.

Question: The Chinese people are very willing to hear Soviet cultural news and the activities of writers. Such as Sholokhov, Ehrenburg, Vasilevskaya, Korneichuk, what are they doing now?

Answer: Sholokhov has completed the work he has been doing for several years, namely, the first part of the novel "They Fought for Their Country." This novel describes the Great Patriotic War.

Ehrenburg's recent masterpiece is the novel "The Storm," which narrates the Soviet people's struggle against fascism. Recently, he has mainly worked as a commentator on international issues.

Vasilevskaya recently published several articles on the political and economic situation in France. This is her latest work.

Korneichuk wrote the play "Makar Dubrava" for the Soviet theater last year, which tells the story of the life of miners in the Donets coal mining area. This mining area was destroyed by the Germans, but due to the strength of our working class, it was revived in an unprecedentedly short period of time. Now Korneichuk is writing a new play.

Question: What is the delegation's opinion on the illegal sentencing of the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party by the U.S. Federal Court in New York?

Answer: Like our Chinese friends, this verdict aroused our anger. This verdict, due to its anti-people essence, reflects the policies of the American reactionaries. This policy is against the American people, against democracy, and against all democratic freedoms. These democratic freedoms are only verbally recognized by the American reactionaries, but in reality, they are trying to completely destroy them.

This is the opinion of the Soviet cultural workers. (Translated by Jun Qiang)

　　苏代表团长西蒙诺夫　
    答复本报记者提问
    【本报讯】苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团于前（二十七）日举行记者招待会。代表团团长西蒙诺夫与发表声明同时，回答了本报记者提出的六个问题。这些问题是本报记者于二十五日书面提出的。兹志问题与答复如下：
    问：中国人民热烈欢迎苏联代表团。我们愿意听到苏联代表团在到达我国首都的途中，在首都，在上海，南京，济南，天津停留时期的印象。
    答：我们已经在声明中，回答了这个问题的主要部分。现在我只再补充一些。除去问题中所谈到的那几个城市外，我们回北京时还到过济南。济南城的劳动人民首先是工人阶级，对苏联和对苏维埃人的友爱气氛，给与我们异常深刻的印象。我还要补充的就是，在我们从北京返国时，我们将高兴停留在沈阳和那里的工人及知识分子见面。我们从苏联来的时候，沈阳的劳动人民热情地欢迎我们。但是，我们因为要赶赴北京参加十月一日这个全国人民的节日，在沈阳只停留了数小时。不久我们将填上我们旅程中的这个空白。
    问：你认为我国报纸在加强中苏友谊以及通过报纸表达你们的友谊帮助方面，应该多作一些什么？
    答：就我们所知，中国报纸以巨大的友情的关怀，刊载了我们代表团来到人民民主的中国的消息。我们代表团团员的许多的讲演，都在中国报纸上发表了全文或详细的摘要。因此中国报纸本身已回答了这个问题。报纸已经把我们谈话中所包含的关于在苏联的生活和文化建设情形，介绍给了我们未曾到达的城市和乡村中的读者。现在我们只需中国报纸的友谊的帮助，把我们最热烈的友情问候和对于新中国文化建设事业中最伟大成就的最真挚的愿望，转达给无数我们没有来得及去的城市和乡村中的朋友们。
    问：由于你们来到中国，使中苏两国的友谊愈加密切了。为了进一步增强我们两个伟大国家的友谊，两国人民今后应准备作些什么？
    答：苏联文化工作者代表团，回到苏联后，为了进一步加强和中国文化的联系，我们拟订了三项任务：第一——在许多讲演和报告中，我们要详细地告诉我们的同胞们，关于我们在新中国看到的一切，尤其是中国人民在文化建设领域的卓越成就。第二——同样的把这些发表在苏联报纸上。第三——我们要向派我们作代表来的苏联社会和文化组织，报告关于中国朋友对我们提出的问题和中国朋友对苏联新社会建设经验的关心，以及我们中国友人关于苏联文化组织工作实际情况的具体请求。这就是我们回国想要做的事。至于另外的那个问题，即中国的朋友应该发展怎样的工作以加强我们两国人民的友谊——这件事，依据我们的意见，而主要是由于我们的观察，我们的中国朋友们，不需要我们的任何建议，就已经很好地知道为巩固我们两国人民的友谊要做什么，并且已经做过许多了。
    问：请你们谈一谈你们来到中国以后，对于中国文化艺术工作方面的印象。同时，请谈一谈你们对于今后中苏两大国家文化艺术交流的意见。
    答：这个问题实质上是两个问题，第一个问题在我们的讲演中已经回答了许多。但是我还想再补充几句。我们在北京看到了中国的绘画、雕刻、版画展览；我们在南京参观了艺术学校的展览会；我们看到过许多中国剧团和团体的乐队；我们曾看到中国新剧和古典戏剧的表演；我们还参观了鲁迅艺术学院的学生和不久以前从布达佩斯回国的青年团体的表演。我们在这里很难说出我们每一个人的感想，但是由于我们看到中国艺术的表现，使我们得到巨大力量和卓越才能的印象。我们一点也不怀疑：把古典遗产和中国人民创作中最好的模范，与每天每时由解放了的中国人民现代生活中所产生的一切艺术结合起来，那么中国艺术将达到异常繁荣的时期。由于尽力为人民服务的中国艺术家们，以及他们逐日扩大与人民的结合，就已经是这件事情的确凿证据。
    这问题的第二部分是关于交换经验的问题。昨天苏联代表团，在和以郭沫若为首的政务院文化教育委员会代表们三小时的座谈会中，正是谈的这个问题。关于我们互相交换经验，我们以为把我们昨天关于交换经验的全部谈话记录，转达给我们中国朋友，使他们能自己审视而利用这些记录是更为合宜的。
    问：中国人民非常愿意听到苏联的文化消息和作家的活动。如萧洛霍夫、爱伦堡、瓦希列夫斯卡、高涅楚克，他们现在作些什么？
    答：萧洛霍夫完成了他数年来进行着的工作，即完成了长篇小说“他们为祖国而战”的第一部。这小说是描写伟大的卫国战争的。
    爱伦堡最近的巨著即是长篇小说“暴风雨”，叙述苏维埃人民同法西斯的斗争。最近，他主要是作国际问题的政论家。
    瓦西列夫斯卡不久以前发表了关于法国政治经济情况的几篇文章。这是她最近的著作。
    高涅楚克去年曾为苏维埃剧院写了《马加尔·都布拉瓦》剧本，内容是叙述顿尼兹煤矿区矿工的生活。这个矿区曾被德国人破坏了，但由于我们工人阶级的力量，在空前短促的时间内就复兴起来。现在高涅楚克正在写一个新剧本。
    问：代表团对于美国共产党十一个领袖被美国纽约联邦法院非法判处徒刑有何表示？
    答：和我们的中国朋友们一样，这个判决，引起我们的愤怒。这个判决由于它反人民的实质，反映了美国反动分子们的政策。这政策是反对美国人民、反对民主、反对一切民主的自由。这些民主自由是美国反动分子们只在口头上承认，但实际上却企图彻底毁灭的。
    这就是苏联文化工作者的意见。  （君强译）
