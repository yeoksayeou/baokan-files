Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: The Central Committee of the Algerian Communist Party sent a letter of congratulations to Chairman Mao Zedong on October 9th. The full text of the congratulatory letter is as follows:

To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party:

The Central Committee of the Algerian Communist Party, accurately representing the profound feelings of the Algerian people, extends its respects to the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people and expresses its warm congratulations on the founding of the People's Republic of China.

This great event, which truly liberated 475 million people from the iron heel of imperialism and its agents in China, is deeply understood by the Algerian people, who have been under the cruel shackles of colonialism for one hundred and twenty years.

The struggle and victory of the Chinese people have truly liberated the Chinese people and expanded and strengthened the peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union of Lenin and Stalin—the bastion of peace and the reliable friend and selfless supporter of all oppressed peoples.

The struggle and victory of the Chinese people is an admirable example for the struggle of all peoples against the oppression of imperialism. For this reason, Comrade Mao Zedong, our people deeply thank you.

Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live the People's Republic of China!

Central Committee of the Algerian Communist Party, Rabi’a Bouhali (signed)

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: TASS, Tehran, 17th: The Tehran newspaper Mantak Weekly, commenting on the developments in China and the relations between Iran and China, stated: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army has achieved victory, and the People's Government has been formally established in China. The Iranian people welcome this victory and demand that the Iranian government formally recognize the government formed by the Chinese working people as quickly as possible."

The publication pointed out: The existence of the Iranian embassy stationed with the fleeing and wandering government of Chiang Kai-shek is a joke. The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs must stop this puppet farce and send an ambassador to Beijing—the real capital of China—as soon as possible.

　　阿尔及尔共产党中央
    祝贺中国人民胜利
　  伊朗报纸促其政府与我建立邦交
    【新华社北京二十四日电】阿尔及尔共产党中央委员会十月九日致函毛泽东主席致贺。贺函全文如下：
    中国共产党主席毛泽东同志：
    确切代表阿尔及尔人民深厚情感的阿尔及尔共产党中央委员会，谨向中国共产党和中国人民致敬，并在中华人民共和国成立之际，表示热烈的祝贺。
    这一使四亿七千五百万人民从帝国主义及其在中国代理人的铁蹄下得到真正解放的伟大事件，更为阿尔及尔人民所深切了解，因为一百二十年以来，我国一直是在殖民地主义的恶毒枷锁之下。
    中国人民的斗争和胜利，使中国人民得到了真正解放，扩大和加强了以列宁斯大林的伟大苏联——和平的堡垒和所有被压迫人民的可靠朋友和大公无私的支持者——为首的和平民主阵营。
    中国人民的斗争和胜利，对所有反对帝国主义者压迫的人民的斗争，是一个可赞扬的例子。因为这个理由，毛泽东同志，我国人民深深的感谢你。
    中国共产党万岁！中华人民共和国万岁！
    阿尔及尔共产党中央委员会拉比·蒲哈利（签字）
    【新华社北京二十四日电】塔斯社德黑兰十七日讯：德黑兰的曼台克周报论中国的事态发展和伊朗与中国的关系称：“中国人民解放军已取得了胜利，人民政府已在中国正式组成。伊朗人民欢迎这个胜利，并要求伊朗政府最迅速地正式承认中国劳动人民所组成的政府”。
    该刊指出：伊朗派驻逃亡和流浪的蒋介石政府的大使馆的存在，乃是一个笑柄。伊朗外交部必须停止这个傀儡滑稽剧，并尽速派遣大使到北京——中国的真正首都。
