[City News] Following the cessation of activities by the former United States Information Service in this city, the nineteen Chinese employees formerly employed there were dismissed on August 20th by their employer, Clubb (former US Consul-General). Eleven of these employees elected five representatives to demand severance pay from Clubb, but Clubb delayed payment, leading to a labor dispute. The city's Labor Bureau accepted the labor side's request and convened two mediation sessions with both labor and management, reaching an agreement. The bureau issued formal mediation documents to both labor and management on the 12th.

Throughout the dispute and mediation process, employer Clubb treated the Chinese employees with an attitude of imperialist arrogance and deceit. He consistently maintained that annual leave pay and retirement savings were equivalent to severance pay. He also used various methods to slander the Chinese employees, employing deceptive tactics to prevent the employees from directly negotiating with him. On September 13th, the labor side further lowered their demands, but Clubb still refused. The employee representatives then applied to the city's Labor Bureau for mediation on September 18th. After the Labor Bureau convened two consecutive mediation meetings with both labor and management, Deputy Director Shi Huaibi of the Labor Bureau, synthesizing the demands of the labor side and the opinions of the capital side, proposed the following mediation solutions:

1.  Regarding the interpretation of severance pay, retirement funds, and annual leave pay: Annual leave pay is issued because workers do not take leave throughout the year and cannot be considered severance pay. Furthermore, retirement funds are deducted at six percent from workers' wages, and the six percent savings deducted by the former US Information Service is a form of exploitation. The so-called savings are actually wages owed to the workers by the capital side, making it even more unreasonable to use them as severance pay. Using annual leave pay and retirement savings as severance pay is neither tenable nor reasonable.

2.  Policy and Regulation Basis: The People's Daily of August 18, 1949, published seven decisions approved by the North China People's Government of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, the third of which stipulated that when workers leave a factory, they should be "paid a certain amount of severance pay based on the length of their service." Article 12 of the collective contract for the construction industry approved by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau states: "If the capital side dismisses employees, they should be paid one to three months of actual wages based on their years of service, as well as the year-end bonus they are entitled to, as severance pay." These are the policies and implementation regulations established by the Chinese People's Government. The capital side, however, claims that US salary regulations are unified and cannot be changed, but these are US methods and are simply not applicable to China. Since the capital side of the former US Information Service employed Chinese workers in China, it should, of course, abide by the laws and decrees of the Chinese People's Government and is not allowed to violate and evade them. The dismissal of employees by the former US Information Service should be based on length of service and one to three months of severance pay must be paid.

3.  The employees already signed and received their salaries and annual leave pay on August 20th, and August 20th should be recognized as the date of dismissal; however, the capital side's dismissal procedures were incomplete because they did not pay severance pay and delayed the time, preventing the employees from seeking other employment and affecting their lives. The capital side should be responsible for compensating the employees for the loss of time and impact on their lives, equivalent to half of their actual wages.

4.  Temporary worker Bai Zhidu, exceeded the stipulated period, the capital side did not terminate his contract, and ordered him to change to other work, so he should still be treated as a permanent worker, and severance pay should be issued according to his length of service.

Based on the above methods, labor and management immediately reached an agreement. However, after the two sides reached an agreement, just as the meeting was about to adjourn, Clubb suddenly made a request to Deputy Director Shi, saying that the agreed-upon severance pay and compensation fees were "inconsistent with the regulations stipulated by the US State Department" and that he had to consult the US State Department before he could comply with the agreement and pay the employees severance pay, etc. Deputy Director Shi immediately exposed Clubb's conspiracy in making this request: First, he wanted to overturn all the agreements reached in the mediation; second, he attempted to make our government personnel inadvertently recognize his "Consul-General" as having a legal status in New China. This is absolutely not allowed. Clubb then had no choice but to guarantee compliance with the following agreements: Those with less than half a year of service will be paid half a month's actual salary; those with half a year to one year of service will be paid one month's actual salary; those with one year to one and a half years of service will be paid one and a half months' actual salary; those with one and a half years to two years of service will be paid two months' actual salary; those with two years to two and a half years of service will be paid two and a half months' actual salary; and those with two and a half years or more of service will be paid three months' actual salary. The official dismissal date should be August 20th. Clubb should be responsible for compensating the employees for the losses they suffered from August 21st to October 5th due to the employer's failure to pay severance pay, and will be paid half of their due wages. Both parties also agreed that from October 5th to October 14th, all severance pay and compensation fees would be paid to the eleven employees, including Wang Ruihui, calculated in US dollars and converted at the exchange rate on the date of payment.

### 前美新闻处劳资争议　京劳动局调解获协议  雇主柯乐博狡赖无效阴谋破产  保证遵守协议照付解雇赔偿费

　　前美新闻处劳资争议
  　京劳动局调解获协议
    雇主柯乐博狡赖无效阴谋破产
    保证遵守协议照付解雇赔偿费
    【本市讯】本市前美国新闻处停止活动后，受雇于该处的中国职工十九人，于八月二十日被雇主柯乐博（前美国总领事）予以解雇，其中十一人推选代表五人向柯乐博要求发给解雇费，但柯乐博拖延不发，因而引起劳资争议。本市劳动局接受劳方的请求，先后召集劳资双方进行了两次调解，获得协议。该局并于十二日分别发给劳资双方正式的调解书。
    在双方争议和调解的过程中，雇主柯乐博仍以帝国主义横蛮狡诈的态度对待中国职工，始终坚持年假金退休储金即等于解雇费，并用各种方式污蔑中国职工，玩弄欺骗手段，阻止职工和他们直接协商。九月十三日劳方再度降低要求，柯乐博仍予以拒绝。职工代表乃于九月十八日申请本市劳动局调解。经劳动局召集劳资双方一连举行两次调解会议，最后由劳动局史怀壁副局长综合劳方的要求和资方的意见，提出调解办法如下：
    一、关于解雇费与退休金、年假金的解释：年假金是因工人常年不告假而发之假金，不能算是解雇费。又退休金是从工人工资中扣百分之六，而前美新闻处所扣的百分之六的储金，是一种剥削，所谓储金实乃资方欠发工人的工资，作为解雇费更是不合理的。以年假金、退休储金作为解雇费，既不能成立，也不合理。
    二、政策条例根据：一九四九、八、一八人民日报载华北人民政府曾批准华北职工大会的七个决定，在第三个决定中有工人离厂时“按厂龄长短发给一定的解雇费”。北京市人民政府劳动局批准的建筑业集体合同第十二条：“如资方解雇职工时，应按其服务年限发给一个月至三个月之实际工资，及年终应得之酬劳金作为遣散费”。这是中国人民政府所定的政策和执行条例，资方却说美国薪金规定是统一的不能变更，但这是美国的办法，根本不能适用于中国。该处资方既在中国雇用中国职工，当然应遵守中国人民政府的法令，不容违法狡赖。前美新闻处解雇职工应根据工龄付给一月至三月解雇费，必须执行。
    三、职工已于八月二十日签字领得薪金、年假金，应承认八月二十日为解雇日期；但资方解雇手续不完备，因不付解雇费而拖延了时间，使职工不能另谋职业，影响了生活，这些应由资方负责赔偿职工时间上、生活上的损失费，折实际工资之一半发给。
    四、临时工白志铎，超过规定期限，资方没有解约，且令其改就其他工作，故仍应按长工处理，依其工作年限发给解雇费。
    根据以上的办法，劳资双方当即成立协议。但是双方取得协议之后，即在将要散会的时候，柯乐博突然向史副局长提出要求说：所协议的解雇费和赔偿费“与美国国务院所规定的条例不合”，须在请示美国国务院之后，才能遵照协议发给职工解雇费等。史副局长当即着重揭露柯乐博这种要求的阴谋在于：第一、想推翻先后在调解中所成立的全部协议；第二、借此企图使我人民政府的人员在无意中承认其“总领事”在新中国的合法地位。这是决不容许的。柯乐博这才无可答辩地保证遵守以下各项协议：工龄半年以下者付给实际工资半月；工龄半年至一年者付给实际工资一月；工龄一年至一年半者付给实际工资一个半月；工龄一年半至二年者付给实际工资二个月；工龄二年至二年半者付给实际工资二个半月；工龄二年半以上者付给实际工资三个月。正式解雇日期应为八月二十日，八月二十一日至十月五日因雇主未付解雇费而使职工蒙受的损失，应由柯乐博负责赔偿，付给其应得工资之半数。双方并同意自十月五日至十月十四日将解雇费和赔偿费全部付给职工王瑞惠等十一人，均以美金计算按付给日之牌价折付。　　　　（市府新闻处）
