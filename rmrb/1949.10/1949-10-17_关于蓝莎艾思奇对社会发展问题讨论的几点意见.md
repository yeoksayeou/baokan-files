Some Opinions on Lan Sha and Ai Siqi's Discussion on Social Development Issues
　　Ye Yimin

　　The *Beiping Liberation Daily* published two articles, Lan Sha's "Labor Created Man" on July 13th and Ai Siqi's "Critique of Several Non-Historical Viewpoints Regarding Social Development Issues" on July 26th. Ai Siqi's article addresses certain viewpoints in Lan Sha's article that he considers "non-historical viewpoints."

　　Currently, various organizations, factories, and schools are studying or have studied the history of social development. Discussions on this issue may be helpful in inspiring and promoting our study. I am presenting some opinions after reading these two articles for the reference of Comrades Lan and Ai, and for everyone's research.

　　When I wrote this article, I was particularly encouraged by the editor's note in the *Beiping Liberation Daily*, which stated: "We hope that in the future readers... if there are disputes on this issue, they can conduct joint research through this newspaper." This call increased my courage to participate in the discussion of this issue.

　　　　What is the theme? What problem needs to be solved?

　　The theme of the current study of the history of social development in the *Beiping Liberation Daily* is "How Did Man Come About?" The main purpose is to solve how labor created man, establish the "labor view of labor creating the world" and "expose all past exploitative class old views that despise labor and workers and peasants," that is, to "break down old views and establish new labor views" (quoted from the editor's note on July 13th). In a city like this, which has been liberated for less than half a year, and with our target audience being mainly general workers, students, shop assistants, and cadres of organizations, the role and purpose of propaganda and education that the *Liberation Daily* wants to play and achieve by organizing the "study and discussion" column by proposing such topics and guiding readers to achieve such purposes, I think is correct and practical. If we do not pay attention to these objective conditions and our target audience, and extravagantly talk about academics, or want to guide readers to a more specialized discussion and research on the history of social development (especially ancient history), on the contrary, it would be divorced from reality.

　　Now, let's first look at Lan Sha's article. He specifically addresses the general tendency in study and discussion to focus on the biological evolution viewpoint of "how apes became humans," without focusing on "labor creating mankind itself" and linking it to criticizing one's own past erroneous views on labor to establish correct labor views and historical views. Therefore, in the concluding remarks of his article, he particularly reiterates: "When we study 'How Did Man Come About?', the important thing is not to study the history of biological evolution, but to study the labor viewpoint, to understand that labor created man, labor created the world, and created human wealth and culture. Combined with our own thoughts, criticize our own exploitative consciousness of despising labor, combined with the realistic needs of China today, and highly promote labor enthusiasm, stand at our own work posts, and strive to build a new democratic New China." "In this way, revolutionary theory will play a role in guiding revolutionary action for us, and will not become dogma." In this case, focusing on studying "from ape to man" is suitable for the educational role that the *Liberation Daily* wants to play to the masses through the newspaper, and is consistent with the learning objectives to be achieved. In his article, Lan Sha clearly states what he wants to help readers understand, and what to combine with, that is, the learning objectives and learning methods.

　　However, Ai Siqi's article proposes that the purpose of studying the history of social development "is to correctly understand the laws of social development, correctly understand the laws of the struggle activities of laborers and producers in various historical periods, to understand under what social material living conditions laborers changed from unexploited producers in primitive communes to exploited, and to understand how the production conditions created and developed by the working masses in various historical processes inevitably replaced one exploitative system with another, and finally created and developed highly material living conditions that eliminate all classes and exploitation." Obviously, here, Ai Siqi did not carefully consider that the theme discussed in the *Liberation Daily* is not to discuss the general laws of the entire history of social development, but only to talk about the topic "How Did Man Come About?". He also did not pay attention to whether it is possible through newspapers to involve the discussion of various complex issues contained in each historical development stage of the entire history of social development. As for our target audience, considering their theoretical level, time, and energy, it is necessary to consider for a long time whether it is possible to involve the purpose of studying the history of social development that he proposed in a single study and discussion. In particular, he did not point out that studying the history of social development should be linked to reality, and should be combined with one's own thoughts and work. Therefore, such excessive demands, too large a scope, and too many problems to be solved, deviate from the study and discussion of this issue that the newspaper wants to and can organize, and propose the general purpose to be achieved by studying the history of social development. Strictly speaking, this is the result of a dogmatic ideological method that does not look at the problem, the object, or the objective and subjective actual situation.

　　　　The Problem of Religious Myths

　　The first argument in Ai Siqi's article mainly criticizes Lan Sha's statement that "the claims that God, Heaven, spirits, and the essence of the sun and moon created man are merely lies deliberately fabricated by the exploiting classes." He believes that the emergence of religious myths did not occur only after the emergence of class society, but existed before the emergence of classes in primitive communist society, and was not fabricated by the exploiting classes. Ai Siqi's statement itself is correct. However, it does not address Lan Sha's issue. Lan Sha's article does not discuss the emergence or origin of religious myths, but only points out that it is wrong for some people to still believe in ideas such as God, spirits, Heaven, and the essence of the sun and moon creating man. He also points out that the purpose of this statement is to make the working people believe that exploiters are born to exploit people. For example, in the first section of the first chapter of *A Brief History of Social Development* (edited by the Liberation Press), it starts with the "Scopes Monkey Trial" in the United States, because the young teacher Scopes violated the pastor's statement—that God created man according to his own model—and said that man evolved from apes. This kind of anti-scientific and reactionary thinking is still being openly promoted by Christianity today. Especially in old China, where science and culture are backward, the vast majority of people are still being eroded by various superstitious, reactionary, and non-historical materialistic viewpoints. Lan Sha's article grasps the theme of his discussion and addresses these existing erroneous ideas in reality, which I think is correct. Since Lan Sha's article does not discuss the issue of the emergence of religious myths, in his quotation from Engels' "From Ape to Man," the last sentence, "Law and politics developed, and with them also developed human affairs, the illusory reflections in the human mind—religion," has already pointed out that religion appeared in primitive communist society. Therefore, in his extension, he only focuses on explaining how the exploiting classes fabricated lies to fool the working people.

　　Besides what has been discussed above, we can now look at the statement that "the claims that God, Heaven, spirits, and the essence of the sun and moon created man are lies deliberately fabricated by the exploiting classes." This statement is not a "violation of historical materialism." In primitive communist society, mankind did not understand natural phenomena, and they were fearful and terrified of natural phenomena, and their worship was only due to the lack of power in the struggle against nature, and the inability to understand the surrounding natural phenomena (natural phenomena, physiological phenomena, dreams, death, etc.), resulting in some simple religious concepts. As for systematic and "theoretical" explanations that God, Heaven, spirits, etc., created man, and deeply anesthetized the working people, they were strengthened by the rulers of various social development stages after the emergence of class society. In this way, saying that they are lies deliberately fabricated by the exploiting classes does not violate the historical materialist viewpoint. Moreover, Ai Siqi himself wrote in his own "Draft Outline of the History of Social Development" (published by North China University) on page 5: "In the past, China regarded mankind as the spirit of all things born by nature. In fact, mankind is not born like this, but transformed from apes through labor... The historical thought of the exploiting classes often regards the ruling position of the exploiters as natural, which is completely lying." May I ask, Ai Siqi himself can say that treating humans as being born by nature is a complete lie of the exploiting classes. Does Lan Sha saying that the idea that God, Heaven, spirits, etc., created humans is a lie deliberately fabricated by the exploiting classes become a "non-historical viewpoint"?

　　　　Those Who Labor with Their Minds Govern, Those Who Labor with Their Strength Are Governed

　　The second argument in Ai Siqi's article mainly criticizes Lan Sha for simply calling the factual statement "Those who labor with their minds govern, those who labor with their strength are governed" a "reactionary heresy" and "poisonous thought." He believes that this "fails to recognize that at a certain stage in the development of human society, the division and opposition between mental and physical labor is also an inevitable phenomenon."

　　The focus of the problem lies here: should we today teach and enlighten readers by placing the emphasis on pointing out that "Those who labor with their minds govern, those who labor with their strength are governed" is a reactionary and poisonous thought today? Or should we help our readers with their current level of understanding to recognize that "the division and opposition between mental and physical labor, under certain conditions of social material life development and at a certain stage of production development, is inevitable, conforms to the laws, and has progressive significance"? My personal opinion is that if we place the emphasis on the latter to emphasize this point, we would be committing the error of "non-historical viewpoint" in today's revolutionary historical era.

　　Today, facing the demands of our era, facing our mass of readers, it is correct to ruthlessly expose and eliminate the reactionary and poisonous idea of "Those who labor with their minds govern, those who labor with their strength are governed." We must never purely academically, leave today's historical reality, and archaeologically objectively explain the inevitability, conformity to the laws, and progressiveness of "Those who labor with their minds govern, those who labor with their strength are governed" under certain conditions of social material life development.

　　After criticizing Lan Sha's above statement, Ai Siqi continued: "If Lan Sha said this... as long as one learns in one morning that labor creates man and breaks down this absurd heresy, one will understand that the exploiters also 'should' share the responsibility of labor, and one can mobilize the working people to eliminate classes and eliminate the system of man exploiting man, without asking about the development of social material life and political conditions." He also said: "When an exploitative system still plays a certain progressive role in the development of social production, it should not 'should' be eliminated, but precisely 'should' exist and develop." These two paragraphs clearly refer to the fact that the national bourgeoisie in today's new democratic society should not 'should' be eliminated, but 'should' exist and develop. According to Chairman Mao and the central government's documents, this statement is of course correct, and no one can deny it. But can we point out that the exploiting classes are wrong and should be eliminated in the future? I think it is not only possible, but also necessary. For example, in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Chairman Mao clearly pointed out that the national bourgeoisie is also one of the main exploiting classes in China, and should not act as the leader of the revolution, nor should it occupy a major position in the state power. It is only at the present stage that "in order to cope with the oppression of imperialism and to improve the backward economic position, China must make use of all urban and rural capitalist factors that are beneficial rather than harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood, unite the national bourgeoisie, and work together." He also specifically pointed out that "when socialism is implemented in the future, that is, when private enterprises are nationalized... the people will have a powerful state machine in their hands and will not be afraid of the national bourgeoisie rebelling." Isn't this a unified contradiction of pointing out that the exploiting classes should be eliminated in the future, but should not be eliminated today? Lan Sha's article clearly points out that on the one hand, the system of man exploiting man, the exploiting classes should be eliminated, so that it is possible to finally establish the communist society that we are striving for, and on the other hand, "in China today, we must first eliminate the enslavement and exploitation of the Chinese people by imperialism, bureaucratic capital, and feudal forces" (Lan Sha's words). Why delete these most important words of others and fit them into the criticism of "non-historical viewpoint"? "As long as one learns in one morning that labor creates man... one can mobilize the working people to eliminate classes and eliminate the system of man exploiting man, without asking about the development of social material life and political conditions" This was written by Ai Siqi himself, and Lan Sha cannot be responsible for it! I, as a reader, cannot be convinced of such criticism either. Should we mobilize the working people to eliminate classes and eliminate the system of man exploiting man? Yes. But clearly, what others are referring to is not eliminating others today, but first eliminating the system of enslavement and exploitation of the Chinese people by imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism. There is no call to eliminate everything today. Should the exploitative system be "cursed down"? It should be "cursed down." (The "cursed down" here is borrowed from Ai Siqi's words, and the actual meaning is: it should be pointed out that the exploitative system is unreasonable and will inevitably be eliminated in the future.) Is there anything that cannot be cursed down about the exploitative system? Is it possible that due to the historical development conditions today, because of the existence and development of the national bourgeoisie, even the unreasonableness of the exploitative system and its inevitable elimination cannot be pointed out, and only the progressiveness of the exploitative system is allowed?

　　The discussion of this issue has been very helpful to me. It has made me repeatedly and carefully read these two articles and sorted out some past thoughts in connection with the issues in this debate. Here, I frankly write out my different opinions, hoping that everyone will engage in a deeper discussion and strictly point out the errors in my arguments.

　　关于蓝莎艾思奇对社会发展问题讨论的几点意见
    叶逸民
    北平解放报七月十三日及二十六日先后发表了蓝莎的“劳动创造了人”，及艾思奇的“评关于社会发表问题的若干非历史观点”二篇文章。艾思奇的文章是针对蓝莎的文章中若干观点而认为是“非历史观点”的。
    在目前各机关，工厂，学校等都正在学习或已学过社会发展史，关于这一问题的讨论，在启发推动我们的学习上，可能有一些帮助。兹就读此两篇文章后一些意见，提出供蓝艾二位同志参考，及供大家研究。
    我写此文时，特别是北平解放报的编者按中说：“希望今后读者……如果在此问题上发生争论，还可通过这张报纸，共同研究。”这一号召增加我参加这问题讨论的勇气。
    　　　　主题是什么？要解决什么问题？
    这次在北平解放报上关于社会发展史的学习，题目是“人是怎样来的”，主要目的是要解决劳动怎样创造了人，而树立“劳动创造世界的劳动观点”及“必须揭穿一切过去轻视劳动与轻视工农等等剥削阶级的旧观点”，也就是说要“打破旧观点，建立新的劳动观点”（所引见七月十三日编者按）。在今天这样刚解放不到半年的城市，而我们的对象又是以一般的工人学生店员和机关干部等为主，以解放报所组织的“学习讨论”栏，所欲起的作用和欲达到的宣传教育的目的，提出这样的题目和引导读者达到这样的目的，我认为是正确的，是切合实际的。如果我们不注意到这些客观条件和我们的读者对象，而奢谈学术，或欲引导读者走到比较专门的社会发展史（特别是上古史）的讨论和研究，相反，倒是脱离实际的。
    现在首先看一看蓝莎的文章，他正是针对在学习讨论中一般的把重心放在学习“猿怎样变成人”的生物进化观点上，没有把重心放在“劳动创造了人类本身”并联系批判自己过去对劳动错误的看法而树立正确的劳动观点与历史观点上，因之，在他文章的结束语中特别重复指出：“我们学习‘人是怎样来的’，重要的不是学习生物进化史，而是要学习劳动观点，了解劳动创造了人，劳动创造世界，创造人类财富和文化。结合着自己的思想，批判自己轻视劳动的剥削意识的观点，结合着中国今天的现实需要，去高度发扬劳动热情，站在自己工作的岗位上，努力建设新民主主义的新中国。”“这样革命理论对于我们就起了指导革命行动的作用，而不至于成了教条。”在这里，对学习“从猿到人”来说，是适合于解放报所欲通过报纸对群众所起的教育作用，及符合于所欲达到的学习目的。蓝莎文章中对要帮助启发读者了解什么，结合什么，也即对学习目的与学习方法，提得很明确。
    但是，在艾思奇一文中所提出的，则认为学习社会发展史的目的“是要正确地认识社会发展的规律，正确的认识劳动者、生产者在各个历史时期的斗争活动的规律，要了解劳动者是在什么样的社会物质生活发展条件之下由原始公社不受剥削的生产者变为被剥削者，了解劳动群众在各种历史过程中所创造发展起来的生产条件如何使一种剥削制度必然为另一种剥削制度所代替，而最后终于创造和发展了消灭一切阶级和剥削的高度的物质生活条件”。显而易见的，在这里，艾思奇没有细心的考虑在解放报上所讨论的主题，不是讨论全部社会发展史的一般规律，而是只谈“人是怎样来的”这一个题目。也没有注意到通过报纸，是否可能做到涉及全部社会发展历史的各个历史发展阶段所包含的各种复杂问题的讨论。至于我们的对象就他们的理论水平，时间精力等在一次学习讨论中涉及他所拟出的学习社会发展史的目的，也是考虑很久周密的。特别是没有指出学习社会发展史要联系实际，要结合自己的思想，结合自己的工作来学习。因之，这样要求过高，范围过大，要解决的问题过多，脱离了解决报所欲、所能组织这个问题的学习讨论，而提出一般的学习社会发展史所要达到的目的，严格的说，这是不看问题，不看对象，不看主观客观的实际情况的教条主义思想方法的结果。
    　　　　宗教神话出现问题
    在艾思奇的文章里第一个论点，主要是批评蓝莎的“上帝、天、神、日月精华创造人的说法，只是剥削阶级故意捏造出来的谎言”，他认为宗教神话的出现，不是在阶级社会出现后才有的，而是在原始共产主义社会阶级未出现前就有的，不是剥削阶级捏造的。艾思奇这个说法本身是对的。但是没有针对蓝莎的问题。蓝莎这篇文章不是讨论宗教神话的出现或起源问题，而仅是指出在今天尚有人相信上帝，神，天，日月精华创造人这些思想，是错误的。并指出这种说法的目的，在使劳动人民相信剥削者生来就应当剥削人的。比如在社会发展简史（解放社编）第一章第一节中，就是从“美国的猿猴诉讼”谈起，因为青年教师斯哥布违背了牧师的说法——上帝按照自己的模型创造了人，而说人是由猿猴进化而来的。这种反科学的反动思想，一直到今天仍然被基督教公开的宣传着。特别是科学文化落后的旧中国，广大的人民仍然被各种各样的迷信的，反动的，非历史唯物观点的思想所侵蚀，蓝莎的文章紧握着他讨论的主题，针对现实解决这些现存的错误思想，我认为是对的。由于蓝莎文章不是讨论宗教神话出现问题，所以在他引恩格斯“从猿到人”一节中，最后一句“法律和政治发展起来了，而且和它们一起，也发展起来了人的事物，在人的头脑中的空幻的反映——宗教”就已经指出了宗教是在原始共产主义社会就已经出现了这个问题，因之，在他引伸中只着重说明剥削阶级如何捏造谎言愚弄劳动人民。
    除上面所谈，我们现在就以“上帝、天、神、日月精华创造了人的说法，是剥削阶级故意捏造出来的谎言”来看，这说法也不是什么“违背了历史唯物主义的说法”，人类在原始共产主义社会，由于不了解自然现象，对自然现象感到恐惧，惊怕而至崇拜只是对自然斗争显得无力，对周围自然现象（自然现象，生理现象，梦、死等）不能理解，而产生的一些简单的宗教观念，至于有系统有“理论”的说明上帝、天、神等创造了人，并使之深深的麻醉着劳动人民，还是阶级社会出现后，为各个不同社会发展阶段的统治者所强化了的。如此，说是剥削阶级所故意捏造的谎言，也没有什么“违背历史唯物观点”之处。何况艾思奇在自己所写的“社会发展史提纲初稿”（华北大学出版）中，第五页中自己也写道：“中国过去把人类看做天生的万物之灵，其实人类并不是天生如此的，而是经过劳动的锻炼由猿猴变成的……剥削阶级的历史思想，常常把剥削者的统治地位看做是天生的，这完全是说谎”。试问，艾思奇自己可以说把人当作天生的，是剥削阶级完全说谎，难道蓝莎说上帝、天、神等创造人的说法，是剥削阶级故意捏造的谎言，就是“非历史观点”吗？
    　　　　劳心者治人，劳力者治于人
    艾思奇的文章第二个论点，主要是批评蓝莎把“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”，这样事实的话，简单的称做“反动的邪说”“有毒的思想”。他认为这是“没有认识到人类社会发展的一定阶段上，劳心和劳力的分裂和对立，也是必然的现象。”
    问题焦点就在此，我们今天教导启发读者应把重点放在指出“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”在今天是反动的有毒的思想呢？还是帮助我们现有水平的读者去认识“劳心劳力的分裂对立，在社会物质生活发展的一定条件之下在生产发展的一定阶段，乃是必然的，合规律的并且是具有进步意义的”？我个人的意见认为，如果是把重点放在后者来强调，在今天这样人革命的历史时代，才会犯“非历史观点”的错误。
    在今天，面对我们的时代要求，面对我们的读者群众，我们只有无情的揭破扫除“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的反动有毒的思想才是正确的，绝不能纯学术的离开了今天的历史现实，考古式的客观说明“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”在社会物质生活发展的一定条件下的必然性，合规律性，进步性。
    艾思奇在批评蓝莎上面的说法后，接着说：“蓝莎这样说来……只要一天早上学了劳动创造人，打破了这荒谬的邪说，就懂得剥削者也‘应该’分有劳动的责任，就可以动员劳动人民起来消灭阶级，消灭人剥削人的制度，而不必问社会物质生活与政治条件的发展情况”，又说：“当一种剥削制度在社会生产发展中还起着一定进步作用的时候，它就不是‘应该’被消灭，而恰恰是‘应该’存在和发展的”，这两段话，很明显的是指今天新民主主义社会中民族资产阶级不“应该”被消灭，而“应该”存在和发展，这说法，根据毛主席和中央的文件，当然是对的，谁也不能否认。但是可不可以指出剥削阶级不对，将来应该被消灭呢？我想不但可以，而且是必要的。比如毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中，很明确的就是指出民族资产阶级也是中国的主要剥削阶级之一，不能充当革命的领导者，也不应当在国家政权中占主要的地位。只是在现阶段上“为了对付帝国主义的压迫，为了使落后的经济地位提高一步，中国必须利用一切于国计民生有利而不是有害的城乡资本主义因素，团结民族资产阶级，共同奋斗”而且特地明确地指出“等到将来实行社会主义即实行私人企业国有化的时候……人民手里有强大的国家机器，不怕民族资产阶级造反”，这不是一面指出剥削阶级将来应该消灭，但今天不应该消灭的矛盾统一么？蓝莎的文章里，不是很明白指出一面人剥削人的制度，剥削阶级应当被消灭，这样才可能最后建立我们奋斗所追求的共产主义社会，一面“在今天中国，就首先要消灭帝国主义，官僚资本及封建势力对于中国人民的奴役与剥削制度”（蓝莎语）为什么要删掉别人最重要这几句话，而适合于“非历史观点”的批判呢？“只要一天早上学了劳动创造人……就可以动员劳动人民起来消灭阶级，消灭人剥削人的制度，而不必问社会物质生活与政治条件的发展情况”这是艾思奇自己写的，蓝莎负不起这个责任呀！我这个读者对这样的批评也是不能心服口报的。该不该动员劳动人民起来消灭阶级消灭人剥削人的制度？该。但明明别人指的在今天不是消灭别的，只是首先该消灭帝国主义、官僚资本主义、封建主义对中国人民的奴役与剥削制度，没有喊在今天消灭一切。剥削制度该不该“骂倒”？该“骂倒”。（这里的“骂倒”，是借用艾思奇的话，实际意思是：应该指出剥削制度不合理，将来必然要被消灭。）剥削制度有甚么不可骂倒的呢？难道由于今天历史的发展条件，因为有了民族资产阶级的存在和发展，连剥削制度的不合理将来必然消灭都不能指出，而只许剥削制度的进步性么？
    这一个问题的讨论，对我自己的帮助是很大的，使我反复仔细的读这两篇文章，把过去一些思想联系着这次争论的问题整理了一下，这里我坦率的把我不同的意见写出来，希望大家来更深刻的展开讨论，并严格指出我的论点的错误之处。
