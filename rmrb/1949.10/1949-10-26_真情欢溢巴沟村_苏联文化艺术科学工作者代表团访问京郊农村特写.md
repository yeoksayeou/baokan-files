　　Genuine Affection Fills Bagou Village
　　-- A Special Report on the Visit of the Soviet Cultural, Artistic, and Scientific Workers Delegation to Rural Areas Near Beijing
　　Lù Hào
　　The painter Fenognov and the singer Smelyov from the art performance team of the Soviet Cultural, Artistic, and Scientific Workers Delegation walked out of the house of Guan Zongyin, a poor peasant in Bagou Village. It was completely dark. Although it was very dark, all the villagers and all the members of Guan Zongyin’s family came out to warmly send off the distinguished Soviet guests. People crowded the winding and uneven streets, sending them all the way to the car. Guan Zongyin said, “It is really grateful that the Soviet friends came to our village from thousands of miles away, really grateful, very grateful.” Smelyov replied, “Thank you for your hospitality. For your own happiness, for the happiness of your children and grandchildren, I hope you will work hard!” In the pitch-black night, I couldn't see the expression of the simple Guan Zongyin, but his voice was a little excited. He said, "The Soviet friends care about us so much, and I express my gratitude on behalf of the whole village." Smelyov said, "As long as you need our help, we will do everything in our power to help. The delegation thanks the people of the whole village for their kind hospitality." Occasionally, the light from the flashlight allowed me to see Smelyov, the winner of the All-Soviet competition and the soloist of the Moscow Central Broadcasting Station, and our poor peasant Guan Zongyin. They stood together, so close. Just as the Soviet friends were about to get into the car, Guan Zongyin couldn't help but say again: "We thank the Soviet friends for their concern." Smelyov said, "Thank you in return for your hospitality." Sincerity facing sincerity, our friendship is consolidated so that it can never be separated. After the car left Bagou Village, in the sparse lights, we could still see the small flags flying, the strong arms waving, and hear the long-lasting cheers.
　　When the delegation visited Haidian Town, they visited the families of several farmers in Bagou Village. The poor peasant Guan Zongyin is the deputy village chief of Bagou Village. There are seven people in his family. In the past, he had no land. Recently, after the land reform, he has eight mu of dry land and ten mu of paddy field. The farmers in Bagou Village are just like him. In the land reform, the whole village has 1,442.03 mu of land that no longer needs to pay rent to the landlords. Today, when international friends come, Guan Zongyin’s house is filled with joy as if celebrating a happy event. The room, the courtyard, and even the gate and the street were crowded with people. Farmers used various methods to express their friendship. Tang Shuzhen brought two large bunches of red cockscomb flowers and rushed to send them to Fenognov and Smelyov. Wang Wanqing, who lives next door to the east, sent a few persimmons. Liu Jinrui stood behind Smelyov and shouted, "Take my lotus root, take my lotus root." Gao Changlin sent a big pumpkin. The words "Presented to Soviet Friends" and his own name were crookedly carved on it with a small knife. When Soviet friends visited farmers' families, they asked about everything with concern. They asked if the harvested grain was enough to eat? How many children are there? Do they go to school? Is there a river nearby? They wanted to know every detail. This kind of meticulous care aroused great emotion among the farmers.
　　I saw here with my own eyes that the pain and happiness encountered by Chinese farmers are so deeply connected with the feelings of Soviet friends. The poet, playwright, critic, and novelist Simonov listened so attentively when Shen Cheng, the representative of the district farmers' association, described the land reform in Bagou Village, and the elderly Dubanovina, the Deputy Minister of Education of the Russian Federal Republic, took careful notes. Markoff, Deputy Minister of the Far East Department of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, stood next to Shen Cheng with a notebook. When Shen Cheng talked about Liu Bin, a landlord in Bagou Village, who used to walk around the streets with a birdcage and held a fan when he came out in autumn... but now, he also had to work in the fields. Simonov laughed. After Shen Cheng finished speaking, Simonov asked, "What about the debts borrowed by the poor peasants?" Shen Cheng said, "Usury has been completely abolished." Simonov smiled with satisfaction. Dubanovina had a brief conversation with Hu Lishi, a woman from Luodaozhuang Village. Dubanovina told her: "Our farmers have been collectivized, and the Soviet Union uses machines and electricity for farming." Hu Lishi happily said: "You are here, we have more ways, and we hope the Soviet Union will help us." Hu Lishi is a student of the Land Reform Training Class in the Sixteenth District of Beijing, which was opened not long ago. Dubanovina asked her, "Have you been educated by the Communist Party?" Hu Lishi said: "Now someone is helping us, we have power, because we live better than before, so we welcome the Communist Party." Dubanovina pointed forcefully to the ground with her hand, and she said, "That's right, of course it's happy now, say whatever you want." After speaking, she shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" in Chinese. She patted Hu Lishi on the shoulder and shouted happily: "After the land reform, life will be better." She held Hu Lishi's hand tightly and said, "You are very smart, welcome to the Soviet Union, you go to the Soviet Union to see how our farmers live." Hu Lishi was aroused by this enthusiasm and recalled painfully, "In the past, we couldn't talk to people, but now we can talk to you, we are very happy." Dubanovina agreed with her: "Now there is no wall separating you, and when the children grow up, they will all live a happier life." People laughed. Bai Yuzhen, a military dependent, told Dubanovina that "After the land reform, the landlords and rich peasants were all overthrown, and we can use our true strength to farm the land, and production will develop." She said, "The women here have formed mutual aid labor groups, and I hope you will come to us often." This was the case at a farmers' symposium held in Haidian Town, two miles away from Bagou Village, in the evening. At this time, Dubanovina had just returned from visiting the Central Elementary School in the Sixteenth District. She was still holding a delicate small spinning wheel and shaking it. She warmly hugged Bai Yuzhen and said, "Women's labor is the same as men's, and they can compete with male comrades. In addition, women also have to cultivate and educate children, and educate them how to love the new China more and fight for the new China!"
　　Stoletov, who grew up in the countryside and is now the President of the Soviet Timiryazev Agricultural Academy, was surrounded by a group of farmers, including Ge Jiquan, the representative of the village farmers' association, Liu Zhenqing, the director of the farmers' association, and Hou Yanquan, the village cadre. Stoletov asked the farmers in detail how much land they had? How many people are there in the family? What kind of land do they have? How deep do they plough? What do they plant in the fields? He asked a farmer how much land he planted, and the farmer replied: "I planted twelve mu. After liberation, I don't have to pay rent. I used to have to pay 600 jin." Stoletov smiled and said, "The Soviet Union has long forgotten about paying rent." He asked the farmers how many pigs they raised? What do the pigs eat? How big is each pig? After the farmers answered him, he said interestingly: "Your pigs run all over the street. Soviet pigs don't run. One weighs more than 200 kilograms. You can raise good pigs soon."
　　The farmers in the suburbs of Beijing warmly welcomed the visit of Soviet friends. At a mass meeting of more than 8,000 farmers convened by the Farmers' Association of the Sixteenth District, the farmers presented local products to the Soviet friends. Simonov held lotus root wine, lotus roots, cabbage, radishes, pears, and various local products in his hands. The women put a red flower on the brim of Dubanovina's hat, and the embroidery she received was requested by the peasant women to be brought to Comrade Stalin. Her hands were also piled with things, and later she couldn't even shake hands. Finally, the Chengfu Cooperative Farm in Haidian Village sent a few pairs of straw sandals, which she held and sat on the chair for a long time. The farmers responded to the sincerity of the Soviet friends with sincerity, and the farmers responded to the friendship of the Soviet friends with enthusiasm. Our friendship is closer. For such sincere and enthusiastic friendship, the Soviet friends expressed their reluctance to leave. Stoletov said at the end of the farmers' symposium in Haidian Village: "I believe this is the first meeting, not the last time, and we will meet again in the future. In Beijing or here, in other villages. I hope to meet you in the collective farm in Moscow. You treat us like real brothers. If you come, we will treat you like a family." Bai Yuzhen, a military dependent, said: "Originally, we are a family." This is the unanimous voice of the great Soviet people and our people. Let our enemies be even more embarrassed to hear this voice!

　　真情欢溢巴沟村
    ——苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团访问京郊农村特写
    陆灏
    苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团中的画家费诺格诺夫和艺术演出队的歌唱家史灭略夫走出巴沟村贫农管宗胤的门口，天已经完全黑了。天虽然黑得很利害，但全村的农民和管宗胤全家老少还是出来热烈的送别苏联贵宾。人们拥挤着走在弯曲不平的街道上，一直送到汽车旁边。管宗胤说：“苏联朋友好几千里路到我们村里来，实在感谢，非常感谢。”史灭略夫回答说：“感谢你们的招待，为了自己的幸福，为了子子孙孙的幸福，希望好好努力！”在漆黑的夜里，我不能看到淳朴的管宗胤的表情，他的声音却有些激动。他说：“苏联朋友对我们这样关心，我代表全村表示非常感谢。”史灭略夫说：“只要需要我们帮助，我们一定尽一切力量帮助，代表团感谢全村人民客气的招待。”偶而闪来的电筒的亮光，使我看到这位全苏比赛优胜者，莫斯科中央广播电台独唱家—史灭略夫和我们这位贫农管宗胤。他们立在一起，靠得这样紧。在苏联朋友快要上汽车的时候，管宗胤情不自禁的又一次说：“我们感谢苏联朋友的关心。”史灭略夫说：“反过来感谢你们的招待。”真诚对着真诚，我们的友情就是巩固得这样永远不能离分。汽车离开巴沟村以后，在稀疏的灯火中，犹见飞舞着的小旗、挥动着的有力的臂膀，听到长久不散的欢呼的声音。
    代表团在访问海甸镇的时候，顺便参观巴沟村几个农民的家庭。贫农管宗胤是巴沟村的村副，家里七口人，过去没有地。最近经过土改以后，已经有了八亩旱地，十亩水地。巴沟村的农民都和他一样。在土地改革中，全村已经有一千四百四十二亩零三厘土地不再向地主交租。今天国际朋友来了，管宗胤的房子象办喜事一样，被欢喜充满了。房间里、院里，直到大门口和街上都挤满了人。农民们利用各种方法，表示自己的友谊。唐淑珍拿了两大束红色的鸡冠花，也赶来送到费诺格诺夫和史灭略夫的手里。东隔壁的王万庆送来几个柿子。刘金瑞站在史灭略夫的后面，嚷着：“收下我的藕，收下我的藕。”高长林送了一个大北瓜。上面还用小刀歪歪斜斜刻着“送给苏联朋友”六个字，和他自己的姓名。苏联的朋友访问农民家庭的时候，他们是关心的问着每一件事。他们问收的粮食够不够吃？有几个孩子？上学没有？附近有没有河？每一件细微的事全想知道。这种细微的关怀引起农民极大的感动。
    我在这里亲眼看到：中国农民遇到的痛苦和幸福是这样深切的连系着苏联朋友的心情。诗人、剧作家、批评家、小说家——西蒙诺夫在听取区农会代表沈澄叙述巴沟村土改情况时，他是那样专心的听着，年老的俄罗斯联邦共和国教育部副部长杜白诺维娜用笔仔细的记着。苏联对外文化协会远东部副部长马尔权夫拿着笔记本站在区农会代表沈澄的旁边，当沈澄谈到巴沟村有个地主叫刘彬，过去常常拿着鸟笼在街上东遛西走，秋天出来还要拿着扇子………而现在，他也要上地里做活了。西蒙诺夫呵呵的笑了起来。沈澄谈完了，西蒙诺夫又问：“贫农借的债怎么办？”沈澄说：“高利贷完全废除了。”西蒙诺夫表示满意的微笑着。杜白诺维娜和罗道庄村的妇女胡李氏作了简单的谈话。杜白诺维娜告诉她：“我们的农民已经集体化了，苏联种地都用机器和电气了。”胡李氏高兴的说：“你们来了，我们更有办法了，希望苏联帮助我们。”胡李氏是不久以前开办的北京十六区土改训练班的学员，杜白诺维娜问她：“你是否受了共产党的教育？”胡李氏说：“现在有人帮助我们，我们有了权力，因为比过去过得好，所以我们欢迎共产党。”杜白诺维娜用手有力的指了指地下，她说：“很对，现在当然痛快了，有什么说什么。”说话以后，她用中国话喊“毛主席万岁！”她拍着胡李氏的肩膀欢笑的喊着：“进行了土改，生活就好了。”她握紧胡李氏的手说：“你很聪明，欢迎你到苏联去，你到苏联看看我们农民怎样生活。”胡李氏被这种热情激起了痛苦的回亿，她说：“过去，我们不能和人说话，现在和你们能说话，我们很高兴。”杜白诺维娜同意她的意见：“现在没有一道墙隔住你们了，小孩子们长大了，他们都会过更幸福的生活。”人们都欢笑起来。军属白玉珍告诉杜白诺维娜说：“实行土改，地主富农一齐打倒，以后种地可使用真心气力了，生产就会发展起来。”她说：“我们这里的妇女组成了互助劳动组，希望你常到我们这里来。”这是晚上在离巴沟村二里地的海甸镇开农民座谈会的事。这时候，杜白诺维娜刚参观了十六区中心小学校回来，她手里还拿着一辆精巧的小型纺车摇动着，她亲热的抱着白玉珍说：“妇女劳动是和男人一样的，可以和男同志竞赛，除此之外，妇女还要培养教育小孩子，教育她们怎样更爱新的中国，和为新的中国而斗争！”
    在农村里长大的，现在是苏联契姆里也则夫农业科学院院长的斯托列托夫，在他的周围围拢着一群农民，有村农会代表葛计全、农会主任刘振清、村干部侯言全等。斯托列托夫详尽的问着农民们有多少地？有几口人？有些什么地？耕得多深？地里种些什么？他问一个农民种多少地，农民回答他：“种了十二亩，解放后不交租了，以前要缴六百斤。”斯托列托夫笑着说：“苏联早忘记缴租了。”他问农民们养多少猪？猪吃些什么？每个猪有多大？农民们回答他以后，他有趣的说：“你们的猪满街跑，苏联的猪不会跑，一个有二百多公斤，你们很快就可以养好猪了。”
    京郊农民热烈的欢迎了苏联朋友的访问。在第十六区的农会召开的一个八千余人的农民群众大会上，农民们向苏联朋友献出了土产的礼物，西蒙诺夫的手里提着莲花白酒、抱着藕、大白菜、萝＠、梨，各种各样的土产。妇女们把一朵红花插在杜白诺维娜的帽子边上，她手里接着的刺绣，是农妇们要求她一定带给斯大林同志的。她也是双手堆满了东西，后来连握手也不能握了。最后，海甸村成府合作农场送来了几双草鞋，她一直抱着它长久坐在椅子上。农民们以真诚回答了苏联朋友的真诚，农民以热情回答了苏联朋友的友情。我们的友谊，是更加密切了，对于这样的真诚和热烈的友情，苏联的友人都表示了不愿离开，斯托列托夫在海甸村农民座谈会结束时说：“相信这是第一次见面，不会是最后一次，将来我们还会见面。在北京或在这里，在别的村。希望和你们在莫斯科集体农庄见面。你们对我们真像亲兄弟一样的招待，你们要来，我们也象一家人招待你们。”军属白玉珍说：“本来，我们就是一家人呵。”这是伟大的苏联人民和我国人民一致的声音，让我们的敌人听见这声音更加狼狈吧！
