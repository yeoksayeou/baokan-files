Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 12th: TASS reports: General Chuykov, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, received on October 10th in Berlin the Chairman of the Presidium of the Provisional People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, Dieckmann, all members of the Presidium, and the Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl. Dieckmann first reported to Chuykov on the formation and work of the People's Chamber, as well as the various laws passed by the People's Chamber, and introduced to Chuykov the chairmen of the Presidium of the People's Chamber and Prime Minister Grotewohl. In his speech, Dieckmann explained the political motives for the establishment of the People's Chamber. He expressed indignation at the Western countries' violation of the Potsdam Agreement by establishing a separate West German state, expressed gratitude to the Soviet Union for liberating the German people, maintaining German unity, and advocating for an early peace treaty with Germany, and expressed hope that the Soviet Union would support the People's Chamber's measures.

　　Grotewohl then spoke, explaining the new German government's attitude towards various international obligations. He said: "According to Article 92 of the Constitution of the German Democratic Republic, the Provisional People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic has ordered me to be responsible for forming a provisional government. I have accepted this task. The government's work will be carried out in full compliance with the terms of the Potsdam Agreement and other Allied declarations on Germany. In doing so, we are fully aware of the full burden of guilt that the German people must bear, because they blindly followed the aggressive policies of the Nazi rulers, thereby making possible the crimes committed against the people of Europe, especially the Soviet Union, during the Second World War. According to the decision of the German People's Council (now renamed the German Provisional People's Chamber), we declare that we recognize the reparations obligations imposed on the German people. We are prepared to resolutely fight against the fascist and militarist spirit that plunged the peoples of all countries into the Second World War. We strive to build a democratic country and re-establish peaceful and friendly relations with all countries in the world. We want to be a government that gets things done. Our work must help to improve the living conditions of our people and to restore what has been lost. To achieve these tasks, our people need peace, and achieving peace is our most noble task. We expect the Soviet government to grant the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic the right and possibility to develop its work, so I am prepared to present the government's statement at the meeting of the Provisional People's Chamber on October 12 of this year, together with the government I have formed."

　　After Grotewohl's speech, General Chuykov, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, delivered a statement to the German representatives on behalf of the Soviet government, regarding the German People's Council's decisions on implementing the Constitution of the German Democratic Republic and establishing a Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic in Berlin. In his statement, Army General Chuykov informed the German representatives of the Soviet government's decision to transfer the administrative powers hitherto belonging to the Soviet Military Administration to the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic. This statement received great attention from the German delegation and deeply moved them. Dieckmann, Chairman of the Provisional People's Chamber, then spoke again, saying that the entire Presidium of the Provisional People's Chamber had listened with great attention to the Soviet government's statement regarding the decision made in accordance with the current situation in Germany, "As the speaker of the highest organ of state power, I express the German people's deep gratitude to the Soviet government for this decision. I assure you that the German people will never fail the great confidence placed in them." Then, Grotewohl also spoke again, emphasizing that the Soviet government's statement paved the way for the work of the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic, and announced that he had completed the consultations for the establishment of the Provisional Government. He sincerely thanked the Soviet government for its decision and promised to respond to the Soviet government's statement in his government declaration on October 12.

　　崔可夫接见德代表团宣布苏政府对德声明
    狄克曼等致词表示衷心感谢
    【新华社北京十二日电】据塔斯社柏林讯：德境苏联军政府总督崔可夫将军于十月十日在柏林接见德意志民主共和国临时人民议会主席团主席狄克曼、主席团全体人员及德意志民主共和国临时政府总理格罗提渥。狄克曼首先向崔可夫报告人民议会成立经过与工作情况，以及人民议会通过的各项法律，并向崔可夫介绍人民议会主席团各主席与格罗提渥总理。狄克曼在致辞中说明人民议会成立的政治动机。他对西方国家违反波茨坦决定成立西德分立国家表示愤慨，对苏联解放德国人民，维护德国统一与力主早订对德和约表示感谢，并希望人民议会的各项措施能获得苏联的支持。
    格罗提渥继起致辞，说明德国新政府对各项国际义务的态度。他说：“根据德意志民主共和国宪法第九十二条，德意志民主共和国临时人民议会命令我负责组成临时政府。我已经接受这个任务。政府工作的进行将完全符合波茨坦协定的条款及其他盟国对德的宣言。在这样做时，我们充分地认识到德国人民所必须肩负的全部有罪的重担，因为他们曾盲目地追随国社党统治者的侵略政策，从而使得二次世界大战期间对欧洲、特别是对苏联的人民所犯的罪行成为可能。根据德国人民委员会（现已改为德国临时人民议会）的决定，我们宣布我们承认加诸德国人民的赔偿义务。我们准备对那些将各国人民投入第二次世界大战的法西斯主义及军国主义的精神进行坚决的斗争。我们努力建立民主的国家并与世界上一切国家重新建立和平及友好的关系。我们要成为一个有作为的政府。我们的工作必须对改进我们人民的生活情况和复原有所帮助。为了达成这些工作，我们的人民要和平，获致和平是我们最崇高任务。我们期望苏联政府将给予德意志民主共和国临时政府以发展其工作的权利和可能性，因此我准备与我所组成的政府在本年十月十二日的临时人民议会会议上，发表政府的声明。”
    在格罗提渥致词后，德境苏联军政府总督崔可夫上将按照苏联政府的指令就德国人民委员会关于实行德意志民主共和国宪法并在柏林成立德意志民主共和国临时政府的决定，向德国代表发表声明。崔可夫陆军上将在其声明中将苏联政府的决定通知德国代表，即苏联政府决定将迄今属于苏联军政府的行政职权移交给德意志民主共和国临时政府。这一声明受到德国代表团极大的注意，并深深地感动了德国代表团。临时人民议会议长狄克曼于是再度致词说：临时人民议会主席团全体以极大的注意听取了苏联政府关于根据德国目前情况而作的决定的声明，“我以国家最高权力机关议长的资格，向苏联政府表示德国人民对这个决定的深深感激。我向你保证，德国人民决不辜负给予他们的伟大信心。”接着，格罗提渥也再度致辞，强调苏联政府的声明为德意志民主共和国临时政府的工作开辟了道路，并宣布他已完成了成立临时政府的磋商。他衷心地感谢苏联政府的决定，并应允在他十月十二日的政府宣言内答复苏联政府的声明。
