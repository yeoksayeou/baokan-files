Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd:

　　The National Xinhua Bookstore Publishing Work Conference, at its closing ceremony on the 19th, heard closing remarks by Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The full text is as follows:

　　This meeting was successful, but its shortcomings were insufficient preparation and the excessive length of time it took. The meeting was held after the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and with the Common Program of the CPPCC, publishing work has a clear goal. This is a good condition. The reason for the insufficient preparation is that relations with various regions were not close enough in the past. The Publishing Committee of the Central Propaganda Department and the Xinhua General Store were not very familiar with the situations in various regions, and they did not pay close enough attention to the work of understanding the situation. Therefore, it was necessary to spend a lot of time understanding the situation and the existing problems after the representatives arrived. In the future, now that the national general publishing organization has been established, various regions should reflect the situation to this general organization more often, and we must also pay close attention to the work of understanding the situation. This is our common task with all the representatives. In the future, we must eliminate the phenomenon of each doing things their own way, which was caused by the long-term separation of environments in the past.

　　The achievements of the meeting are that unanimous opinions have been reached on policies, organization, systems, and business. It laid the foundation for the unification of the national Xinhua Bookstore.

　　The Xinhua Bookstore now has 735 branches, but this is far from enough. There are 2,000 counties in the country. Assuming that each county has a branch, it is still short by two-thirds. In addition, there are many places where workers are concentrated, and there are many towns and vast rural areas in various counties. We must go there to do work. What is said above only concerns the issue of distribution. Speaking of editing and reviewing, our existing strength is even more insufficient. Both quality and quantity are far from satisfactory. The Common Program of the CPPCC stipulates "developing the people's publishing industry and focusing on publishing popular books and newspapers that are beneficial to the people." Bookstores have the task of publishing a large number of popular reading materials. These popular reading materials must be compiled by the local areas themselves. Many of the popular reading materials from Beijing cannot be used in Guangdong. In a few years, we will begin to eliminate illiteracy. At present, illiteracy accounts for 80% to 90% of the country's population. If we want to eliminate illiteracy, the publishing industry must have a great development. To achieve this requirement, the Xinhua Bookstore must have its own strength. In order to have strength, it must be unified, and it must cooperate with jointly owned public-private bookstores and private bookstores, guiding them to carry out publishing businesses that are beneficial to the people. If it is not unified, it will not have the strength to meet the coming cultural upsurge. It should be seen that the current situation of the victorious development of the People's Liberation Army is far behind the publishing work. To catch up with the requirements of the situation, it must be unified in order to exert its strength in a more organized manner.

　　Now I would like to put forward five points as parting words, and I hope that the representatives will convey them to comrades in various regions upon their return:

　　First, the publishing business that serves the people has a promising future. This truth has now been clearly placed before us. Xinhua Bookstore and Sanlian Bookstore, publishing organizations that serve the people, have struggled hard for many years, and now they really have a bright future. The difference between our publishing business and the old publishing business is that we unconditionally serve the people. The interests of the people's liberation cause are our only interests. Regardless of whether the bookstore makes money or loses money, regardless of whether personal enjoyment is good or bad, we must serve the people. Under the rule of the Kuomintang, the people's publishing workers even sacrificed their lives for the interests of the people. Such publishing work and publishing workers, in the old view, are simply "fools". However, it is precisely such publishing work and publishing workers who will truly have a future. Stalin said that Communists are made of special materials. We Communists are such special people who unconditionally serve the people. Xinhua Bookstore and Sanlian Bookstore are examples of this kind of publishing business, and outstanding publishing workers across the country will follow this path. We must maintain and carry forward this glorious tradition.

　　Second, we must first serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, because they account for 80% to 90% of the country's population, and their labor is the foundation of the country's independence and prosperity. As everyone knows, the old publishing business simply ignored them, did not serve them, or instead used reactionary publications to numb them. We must not forget the workers, peasants, and soldiers when we enter the cities. Our publishing business must serve the people, first serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and also serve intellectuals and students.

　　This should be noted in two aspects: On the one hand, we must publish a large number of popular books that are beneficial to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and we must try our best to distribute them to them. This meeting has studied some good experiences, such as mobile bookstores with the army, such as cultural cooperatives, such as Xinhua Bookstore in Shanghai putting newspapers and books on cars and selling them in factories, etc. These experiences, whether related to editing or distribution, should be widely disseminated. It should be recognized that this is our most important experience. In addition, we must strive to make book prices cheaper to suit the purchasing power of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

　　On the other hand, the inside of the bookstore must rely on the enthusiasm of the workers and employees, otherwise it will not be done well. Xinhua Bookstore now has 8,000 employees, and special attention should be paid to this issue. In some state-owned enterprises, this phenomenon has occurred, that is, the administrative management focused on production, but ignored the lives of the workers and employees; the trade unions focused on the lives of the workers and employees, but ignored production. A good way is to connect the two, the administrative management should pay attention to production, and at the same time pay attention to the lives of workers and employees, the trade union should pay attention to the lives of workers and employees, and at the same time pay attention to production. In the organization, those who do administrative management work participate in trade union work, and those who do trade union work participate in administrative management. This experience should be emulated by everyone.

　　Third, everyone must support unity and abide by the resolutions of this meeting. Everyone has studied specific methods of unification, which is very good. Unification must be achieved in a planned and step-by-step manner. Only when we are unified and centralized can we have strength. For example, the national Xinhua Bookstore's monthly typesetting capacity is 60 million characters, and printing can reach more than 30,000 reams of paper per month. If it is still done in its own way, it will not be able to give full play to its due role. If it is used in a planned and unified manner, it can greatly improve productivity. This meeting has made several resolutions, which everyone has agreed to. But just agreeing is not enough, it only counts if it is realized. Since you agree with the resolution, and do not oppose the resolution, you must implement the resolution.

　　Unification is like the meeting of friendly forces, everyone is happy, but it is necessary to foresee that there will be trouble. Because the styles, work systems, living habits, etc. are different in various places, it is possible to only see the shortcomings of others and not see the advantages of others. In terms of personnel transfers, it is possible to only see the needs of the local area and not see the needs of the overall situation. This will cause problems. In such a situation, one must be able to suffer losses, criticize oneself more, take the overall situation into consideration, and be able to unite well. Comrades who are doing leadership work should be especially careful and grasp the principle of unity and unification. We must learn from the experience of supporting the government and cherishing the people. This experience is: in order to improve the relationship between the military, government and people, hold a meeting, and the military only criticizes the military, not the government, and the government only criticizes the government, not the military. The military actively supports the government and cherishes the people, and the government mobilizes the people to support the military. Mutual criticism should be carried out in the leading organs and should not be spread casually. If the problem really cannot be solved, ask the superior for instructions.

　　Everyone must recognize the great significance of unification, which is to enable the Xinhua Bookstore to have the strength to meet the high tide of cultural construction in the new China. We must cherish unity and solidarity as we cherish our own eyes. Never engage in mountain-topism, and never be anarchistic or undisciplined. Otherwise, mistakes will be made. I will say it again: unification is a very important issue, and it must be done well.

　　Fourth, cooperate sincerely and frankly with public-private joint ventures or private publishing businesses. The Common Program of the CPPCC stipulates that the people have freedom of publication. Only those who promote imperialism, feudalism, and fascism have no freedom, because that is not the people's publishing business, but the anti-people's publishing business. It should be made clear to private publishers that under the principles stipulated in the Common Program, private publishing businesses have something to do, and they should strive to participate in this business, and should not be passive and hesitant. In the future, the state will establish a General Administration of Press and Publication in the Central People's Government. Private publishing businesses should abide by the laws of the state, but within the scope of the law, there is freedom of publication. As for the division of labor and cooperation between state-owned and private bookstores, the principle of voluntariness should be followed, and no one can force anyone. For example, private bookstores have the right to sell or refuse to sell books published by state-owned bookstores, and state-owned bookstores have the same rights for private bookstores. If the work of private bookstores is better than ours in some aspects and is beneficial to the people, we should learn from them with an open mind. If the work is not done well and is not beneficial to the people, we should frankly criticize them. This criticism is to help them, and the purpose is to make them serve the people. During this period, we already have several ways to cooperate with private bookstores, such as the Joint Publishing House for printing textbooks, and the joint venture bookstore in Shanghai. Under these cooperative methods, work beneficial to the people has been done.

　　Textbooks should be run by the state, because it is necessary, so that the content of the textbooks can conform to the state's policies, and technically they can be printed better, the price can be cheaper, and the distribution can avoid waste. During the period of the Kuomintang reactionaries' rule, the textbook price was set at 2,000% of the printing cost, which was a very heavy exploitation for students. There were many dark secrets in the bookstores in the past, and Mr. Lu Xun was very angry about it. The textbook price mentioned above is just one example. Now, initiated by the Xinhua Bookstore, a Joint Publishing House for textbooks has been organized. The textbook price in Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing and Shanghai is 250% of the printing cost. If it were not for the high price of paper, it would be eight times lower than before, which can alleviate some of the students' pain. This is obviously a big step forward. In the future, the price of textbooks will gradually be reduced. When the state finances allow, it will also be reduced below cost, and the part of the subsidy will be borne by the state. Only when the price of textbooks is very low can illiteracy be eliminated, otherwise it is impossible to eliminate illiteracy. In short, textbooks have a particularly huge impact on the national economy and people's livelihood, so they must be state-owned.

　　In the next year or two, the national economy will still have difficulties, and the printing business may feel too much for the time being. But in the future, it will definitely feel too little. Today, there are many private publishers present, and I hope everyone will work together. As long as it is publishing work that serves the people, not only is competition allowed, but if you win the competition on the point of serving the people, you can also be rewarded by the state. I hope everyone will actively and vigorously participate, and at the same time, I hope that private publishers will review their past actions based on the Common Program of the CPPCC, which are bad things that are sorry for the people, and which are good things that are worthy of the people, so as to improve their business in the future and make contributions to the people. Bad things should be changed quickly, and good things should be done more. Cooperation is a two-way issue. Private publishers also have the responsibility to cooperate with state-owned publishing businesses with a frank and sincere attitude. It cannot be done well by relying on one side alone.

　　Fifth, the staff of Xinhua Bookstore are first of all revolutionaries, and at the same time, they are publishing workers. Revolutionaries are politicians, and unconditionally serving the people is our political direction. Never separate from politics and the people, and publish for the sake of publishing. Revolutionary publishing work is an indispensable part of revolutionary work. It is glorious to be assigned to publishing work in the revolutionary division of labor. The country has given us a great responsibility, and we must be responsible to the people. Therefore, I hope everyone will work hard to study politics, study theory, and study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, we must learn business, because if the business is not done well, the theory is not connected with reality, it is empty theory. Comrades who run bookstores have good conditions for reading. Now our Xinhua Bookstore is both a bookstore and a revolutionary bookstore. This is a learning environment that tens of thousands of people cannot have. We must work harder to study. Our work is always for the purpose of achieving political goals. Our current goal is to realize the Common Program and build a new China. For this purpose, we provide the people with good and rich spiritual food, just as farmers supply food. This task is very important. This work has unlimited prospects, and I hope everyone will work hard.

### 全国出版工作会议闭幕式上　陆定一部长闭幕词全文

　　全国出版工作会议闭幕式上
  　陆定一部长闭幕词全文
    【新华社北京二十三日电】全国新华书店出版工作会议于十九日举行的闭幕式上，由中共中央宣传部长陆定一致闭幕词，全文如下：
    这次会议是成功的，缺点是事前准备不足，时间拖得太长。会议在人民政协之后召开，有了政协的共同纲领，出版工作就有了明确的目标，这是一个好的条件。准备不够的原因是过去和各地关系不密切，中央宣传部出版委员会和新华总店对各地情形不很了解，对了解情况的工作抓得不紧，因而不得不在代表到达后化费许多时间了解情况和存在的问题。今后全国总的出版机构既经建立起来，各地要多多向这个总机构反映情况，我们也要抓紧了解情况的工作，这是我们和各位代表的共同任务。今后一定要肃清过去因为长期分割的环境而产生的各自为政的现象。
    会议的成绩，是在政策上、组织上、制度上、业务上都得到了一致的意见。奠定了全国新华书店统一的基础。
    新华书店现在已有七百三十五家分店，但是这还不够得很。全国有两千个县份，假定每一个县设一个支店，就还差三分之二。此外，还有许多工人集中的地方，各县还有许多市镇和广大的农村，我们必须到那里去做工作。以上所说，还仅是谈发行问题。谈到编审，那末我们的现有力量就更不够了，质量数量都还差得远，政协共同纲领上规定“发展人民出版事业，并注重出版有益于人民的通俗书报”。书店有出版大量通俗读物的任务，这种通俗读物要靠各地自己编，北京的通俗读物拿到广东就有许多不能用。再过几年，就要开始消灭文盲。现在全国文盲占百分之八十到九十，如果要消灭文盲，出版事业必须有很大的发展。要达到这个要求，新华书店就要自己有力量。为了要有力量，就一定要统一，并且要和公私合营的与私营的书店合作，引导他们进行有利于人民的出版事业。如果不统一，就没有力量迎接将要到来的文化高潮。应该看到，现在人民解放军胜利发展的形势，出版工作远远跟不上。要赶上形势的要求，就必须统一，以便更有组织地发挥自己的力量。
    现在我提出五点作为临别赠言，希望各位代表回去传达给各地的同志们：
    第一，为人民服务的出版事业是有前途的。这个真理，现在已经明白地放在我们面前，新华书店、三联书店这样的为人民服务的出版机关，艰苦奋斗了多少年，现在果然有了光明的前途。我们的出版事业与旧的出版事业不同之点，就是无条件为人民服务。人民解放事业的利益对于我们是唯一的利益，无论书店赚钱或赔本，无论个人享受得好或坏，都要为人民服务。人民的出版工作者，在国民党的统治下，甚至不惜为了人民的利益而牺牲自己的生命。这样的出版工作和出版工作者，用旧眼光看来，简直是“傻瓜”。但是，恰恰是这样的出版工作和出版工作者，才真正会有前途。斯大林说，共产党人是用特殊的材料做成的。我们共产党人，就是这样一种特殊人物，他们无条件为人民服务。新华书店和三联书店是这种出版事业的榜样，全国的优秀的出版工作者都将跟着这条道路前进。我们要保持和发扬这个光荣传统。
    第二，要首先为工农兵服务，因为他们占全国人口百分之八十至九十，他们的劳动是国家独立富强的基础。大家知道，旧的出版事业恰恰是不管他们、不为他们服务的，或者反而拿反动的出版品去麻醉他们。我们进了城市，切不可就忘记了工农兵。我们的出版事业要为人民服务，首先为工农兵服务，同时也为知识分子和学生等服务。
    这应该从两方面注意：一方面，要大量地出版有益于工农兵的通俗书籍，而且要想尽办法发行到他们手里去。这次会议已经研究了一些好经验，如随军书店，如文化合作社，如上海的新华书店把书报装在汽车上开到工厂里去发卖等等，这些经验，无论是有关编辑的或发行的，都要广为传布。应该认识这是我们最重要的经验。此外，还要力求书价便宜，以适应工农兵的购买力。
    另一方面，是书店内部一定要依靠工人和店员群众的积极性，否则一定办不好。新华书店现在已有八千员工，要特别注意这个问题。在某些公营企业中曾发生了这种现象，就是行政管理方面注意了生产，而忽略了职工的生活；职工会方面注意了职工的生活而忽略了生产。好的办法是把两者连结起来，行政管理方面要注意生产，同时注意职工生活，工会方面注意职工生活，同时注意生产。在组织上做行政管理的参加职工会工作，做职工会工作的参加行政管理。这种经验，大家应该仿效。
    第三，是大家一定要拥护统一，遵守这次会议的决议。这次大家研究出了统一的具体办法，这是很好的。必须有计划有步骤地来达到统一。要统一起来，集中起来，才有力量。比如全国新华书店每月的排字能力是六千万字，印刷每月可达三万多令纸，如果仍然各自为政，就不能充分发挥其应有的作用，如果有计划地统一起来使用，就可以大大提高生产力量。这次会议，作出了几个决议，是大家所同意的。但光光同意不能算数，要把它实现了才算数。你们既然同意决议，而不是反对决议，就一定要实现决议。
    统一犹如友军会师，大家是高兴的，但是一定要预见到会有麻烦。由于各地的作风、工作制度、生活习惯等等都有多少不同之处，因此可能只看见别人的缺点，看不见别人的优点。在人事调动上，有可能只看到局部的需要，看不到全局的需要。这就会发生问题。在这样的情形下，要能吃亏，要多批评自己，要顾大局，才能团结好。作领导工作的同志特别要当心，要把握住团结统一的原则。要学习拥政爱民的经验，这个经验就是：为了改善军政民关系，开个大会，军队方面只批评军队，不批评政府，政府方面只批评政府，不批评军队，军队方面积极拥政爱民，政府方面动员人民拥护军队。相互的批评，要在领导机关中进行，不许随便传布，实在解决不了的问题，就请示上级。
    大家一定要认识统一的重大意义，在于使新华书店有力量来迎接新中国的文化建设的高潮。我们要宝贵统一和团结，有如宝贵自己的眼睛。千万不可闹山头主义，不可无政府无纪律。否则就会犯错误。我再说一句：统一是十分重大的问题，一定要做好。
    第四，是诚恳坦白地和公私合营或私营的出版业合作。政协共同纲领上规定了，人民有出版自由。只有宣传帝国主义、封建主义、法西斯主义的没有自由，因为那不是人民的出版事业，而是反人民的出版事业。要和私人出版家讲清楚，在共同纲领所规定的原则之下，私营出版事业是有事可做的，他们应该努力来参加这个事业，不应该消极彷徨。今后国家将在中央人民政府中设立出版总署。私营的出版事业应该服从国家的法令，但在法令的范围内，是有出版自由的。至于国营和私营书店之间的分工合作，应以自愿为原则，谁也不能强迫谁。比如私营书店，有权利代销或拒绝代销国营书店出版的书籍，国营书店对私营书店亦有同样的权利。如果私营书店的工作在某些方面比我们做得好，于人民有利，就要虚心向他学习。如果工作做得不好，于人民不利，就要坦白地给以批评。这种批评是对他的帮助，目的是要他为人民服务。在这一时期中，我们已有几种与私营书店合作的方式，例如印教科书的联合出版社，和上海的联营书店。在这些合作的方式之下，做了有益于人民的工作。
    教科书要由国家办，因为必须如此，教科书的内容才能符合国家政策，而且技术上可能印刷得好些，价钱也便宜些，发行也免得浪费。国民党反动派统治的时期中，教科书定价为印刷成本百分之二千，这对于学生是极重的剥削。过去的书店黑幕重重，鲁迅先生曾非常愤慨过，上面所说的教科书的书价，不过是其中的一例。现在由新华书店发起，组织了教科书的联合出版社，京津宁沪教科书的定价为印刷成本百分之二百五十，如果不是纸价高涨，现在比从前低八倍之多，就可以解除学生的一些痛苦。这显然是一大进步。将来教科书的价钱还要逐渐减低，到国家财政允许的时候，还要减到成本以下，赔贴的部分由国家负担。只有教科书价格非常低廉，才可能消灭文盲，否则是不可能消灭文盲的。总之，教科书对于国计民生，影响特别巨大，所以非国营不可。
    在最近一两年内，国家经济还会有困难，印刷事业暂时是可能觉得过多的。但将来一定嫌少。今天有许多私营出版家在座，我希望大家共同努力。只要是为人民服务的出版工作，不仅允许竞争，如果在为人民服务这一点上竞争得胜，还能得到国家的奖励。望大家积极起来，活跃起来，同时也希望私营出版家把自己过去的作为，根据政协共同纲领检讨一下，那些是坏事，对不起人民，那些是好事，对得起人民，以作今后改进业务，和为人民立功的张本。坏事要快快改，好事要多多做。合作问题是双方的，私营出版家也有责任以坦白诚恳的态度和国营出版事业合作，单靠一方面是办不好的。
    第五、新华书店的工作人员，首先是革命家，同时又是出版工作者。革命家就是政治家，无条件为人民服务，就是我们的政治方向。绝不可脱离政治和人民，为出版而出版。革命的出版工作是革命工作中必不可少的一部分，在革命的分工中，分配作出版工作，是光荣的，国家给了我们以重大的责任，我们要对人民负责。因此希望大家努力学习政治，学习理论，学习马列主义和毛泽东思想。同时我们要学习业务，因为如果业务做不好，理论兴实际不联系，就是空洞的理论。办书店的同志有看书的好条件。现在我们的新华书店，既是书店，又是革命书店，这是万人所不能有的学习环境，我们更加要努力学习。我们的工作，永远是为了达到政治的目的。我们现在的目的，就是实现共同纲领，建设新中国。为此目的，我们象农民供给食粮一样，供给人民以良好的丰富的精神食粮。这个任务是十分重大的。这个工作有无限前途，希望大家努力。
