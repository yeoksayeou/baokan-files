Little Red Riding Hood's Escape
    4
    "Hey!
    You are just a child,
    Just a child,
    With too little experience,
    And not enough worldly wisdom.
    This kind of lazy, sleeping,
    Worthless bad master,
    Deserves his misfortune now,
    Am I supposed to be his lackey,
    Letting everyone hate and curse me?
    Besides,
    You have always been so good to me,
    I have my reasons for helping you!
    I have my reasons!"

    Just as he was saying this,
    The old mountain demon was already walking up from the foot of the hill.

    The old mountain demon
    Carrying an umbrella,
    Carefully walking up the mountain step by step,
    Shouting loudly:
    "Little Red Riding Hood,
    This time you can't escape,
    If I don't eat you,
    I'll never be able to sleep."

    His voice was so arrogant,
    So confident,
    But on the other hand, he was so apprehensive,
    Taking a step and then stopping.

    Oh no,
    He's here!
    Oh no,
    His black magic hand,
    Is pushing open the firewood gate!
    Oh no!
    …………………

    At this moment,
    The little yellow dog,
    From beside the corner of the house
    Suddenly jumped out,
    And with a fierce bite,
    Grabbed the heel of the old mountain demon.
    Holding on tightly,
    Biting deeper and deeper.

    "Oh dear, oh my!
    I've been hit by a hook and sickle,
    Definitely,
    I've been hit by a hook and sickle!
    My foot is hooked,
    I'm in so much pain,
    My foot must be broken!
    Heh, heh!
    I can't walk!
    Heh, heh!
    I can't dance!"
    The old mountain demon,
    Cried loudly.

    The little yellow dog,
    Happy with his victory,
    Wanted to sing a song,
    To express his joy,
    So he opened his mouth
    And barked a few times, woof woof woof.

    "Damn you!
    It's you, you little beast!
    I have always fed you,
    I haven't treated you badly,
    How can you be so ungrateful and turn against me,
    And bite me instead?
    And bite me instead?"

    "You say you've been good to me,
    But unfortunately,
    You haven't taken care of my stomach very well,
    I guard the door for you, bite people for you,
    I work hard for you,
    But you never treat me like a person,
    Scolding me, beating me, and ordering me around."

    "What a joke, what a joke,
    This is really a joke!
    You were never a person,
    A dog slave suddenly wants to be a person,
    How can there be such a strange thing in the world?
    Well, I have an old method for you,
    Tomorrow I'll bring two bones
    And a stick
    Let's see which one you choose?

    "Hmph!
    Little Red Riding Hood,
    Old man's heel hurts now,
    Can't catch up with you,
    I'll let you live one more night,
    Tomorrow night I will definitely eat you with rice!"

    The old mountain demon,
    With a twisted face,
    Knitted eyebrows,
    Limping,
    Staggering,
    Went down the mountain.

　　小红帽脱险记
    ４
    “嗨！
    你真是小孩子
    真是小孩子，
    见识太少，
    世故不多。
    这种整天睡觉的
    没出息的坏主人，
    现在该倒楣了，
    我难道还要做他的狗腿子，
    让大家恨我骂我么？
    再说，
    你对我从来就那么好，
    我要帮助你，
    自有我的道理！
    自有我的道理！”
　
    正说着说着，
    老山妖可已经从山坡下面走上来了。
　
    老山妖
    打着一把伞，
    一步一步的留心着走上山，
    口里还大声的喊：
    “小红帽，
    这下你可逃不了，
    不把你吃掉，
    我永世也睡不着觉。”
　
    他的声音那么高傲，
    那么有自信，
    但一面又那么战战兢兢，
    走一步又停一停。
　
    不得了，
    他已经到了！
    不得了，
    他那黑色的魔手，
    正在推开柴门了！
    不得了！
    …………………
　
    这时候，
    小黄狗，
    从屋角旁边
    一下子窜了出来，
    猛的一口，
    咬住了老山妖的脚后跟。
    死死不放，
    越咬越深。
　
    “哎呀，妈呀！
    我中了钩镰枪，
    一定的，
    我中了钩镰枪！
    我的脚被钩住了，
    我痛得不得了，
    我的脚一定钩断了！
    嗬，嗬！
    我走不得路了！
    嗬，嗬！
    我跳不得舞了！”
    老山妖，
    大声的哭了起来。
　
    小黄狗，
    高兴着他的胜利，
    它想唱一个歌，
    表示表示他的欢喜，
    就张开了口
    汪汪汪的叫了几声。
　
    “呔！
    是你呵，这小畜牲！
    我一向喂养着你，
    对你不算错，
    你怎么忘恩负义倒到了戈，
    反而来咬我？
    反而来咬我？”
　
    “你说对我很不错，
    可惜我的肚子
    你管得并不多，
    我为你守门，为你咬人，
    我为你辛辛苦苦的工作，
    你可从不把我当人看，
    骂我，打我，又使唤我”。
　
    “笑话，笑话，
    这真是笑话！
    你本来不是人，
    狗奴才忽然想做人，
    天底下哪有这种怪事情？
    好，对你我有老办法，
    明天我带来两根骨头
    一根棍子
    看你选择哪一门？
　
    “吓！
    小红帽，
    老子现在脚跟痛，
    追不上你，
    侥你再活一晚，
    明晚我一定要用你下饭！”
　
    老山妖，
    歪着脸，
    皱着眉，
    跛着脚，
    一步一拐的
    下山去了。
