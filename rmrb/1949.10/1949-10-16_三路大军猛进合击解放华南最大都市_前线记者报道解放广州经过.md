Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 15th: A frontline reporter reports on the liberation of Guangzhou, stating: Guangzhou, the largest city in South China and the location of the remaining Kuomintang puppet government, was liberated on the evening of the 14th by the People's Liberation Army on the Guangdong front. Before the Liberation Army launched its offensive, there were fifteen regular army corps and twenty-eight divisions of enemy bandits in Guangdong Province, as well as five non-regular security divisions, totaling approximately 150,000 men. The main force was concentrated along the Yuehan Railway between Guangzhou and Qujiang, while the remainder was scattered in the Chao-Shan, Qiongya, and Leizhou Peninsula areas.

Last month, the southward advancing army, with the force of a thunderbolt, flew across the perilous Five Ridges mountain range in northern Guangdong, breaking through the enemy's touted "Guangdong-Hunan-Jiangxi defense line." One route quickly liberated Nanxiong and Shixing in northern Guangdong, while local people's armed forces in South China simultaneously liberated Wengyuan. Another route, after liberating Rucheng on the border of Hunan and Guangdong, advanced on Lechang. Another route liberated Renhua at the beginning of the month, forming a pincer movement against the enemy at Qujiang.

At this time, the White bandit Chongxi hurriedly dispatched its main force, the 46th Army, southward along the Yuehan Railway, vainly attempting to combine with the 39th, 63rd, and 97th Armies to hold Qujiang, dreaming of uniting with Hengyang and Guangzhou as three major strongholds. However, when the White bandit's 46th Army had just arrived in Lechang, the Hunan Liberation Army launched a fierce offensive, forcing the bandit and the enemy's 97th Army to retreat hastily northwards. The enemy's 39th Army, stationed in Qujiang, also shrank south to Yingde overnight, abandoning the 63rd Army to be trapped there alone.

On the night of the 6th, the Liberation Army on all routes launched a fierce joint attack, liberating Qujiang on the morning of the 7th. The defending enemy fled in panic southward. Due to the rapid progress of our army, the enemy's conspiracy to destroy bridges to obstruct the advance of the Liberation Army also failed. In order to prevent the enemy bandits from having any chance to catch their breath, the Liberation Army, which was continuously entering northern Guangdong, quickly divided into two routes and went south, rushing towards Guangzhou.

  　前线记者报道解放广州经过
    【新华社华南前线十五日电】前线记者报道解放广州经过称：华南最大都市、残余国民党伪府所在地广州，已于十四日晚为广东前线的人民解放军解放。在解放军发动攻势之前，广东省境原有敌匪正规军十五个军二十八个师，非正规军五个保安师，共约十五万人；主力集结广州至曲江间粤汉沿线，余则散布于潮汕、琼崖、雷州半岛地区。
    上月下旬，我南进大军以雷霆万钧之势，分路飞越粤北天险五岭山脉，突破敌人吹嘘的“粤湘赣防线”，一路迅速解放粤北南雄、始兴，华南地方人民武装同时解放翁源；一路于解放湘粤交界的汝城后，进逼乐昌；一路则于月初解放仁化，对曲江敌形成钳击之势。
    此时白匪崇禧慌忙遣其主力四十六军沿粤汉路南下，妄图连同三十九军、六十三军、九十七等三个军，固守曲江，梦想与衡阳、广州合为三大固守重点。但当白匪四十六军刚至乐昌时，湖南解放大军即展开猛烈攻势，逼使该匪与敌九十七军仓惶北援，驻曲江敌三十九军也连夜龟缩至英德以南，丢下个六十三军孤零零地困守在那里。
    六日夜，各路解放军猛进合击，于七日晨解放曲江，守敌慌忙南逃。由于我军进展神速，敌人破坏桥梁以阻滞解放军前进的阴谋亦归破产。为使敌匪不得喘息机会，源源开入粤北的解放军迅即分成两路南下，猛扑广州。
