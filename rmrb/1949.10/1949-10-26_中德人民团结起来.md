　　The Central People's Government's decision to establish diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic is the unanimous wish of all Chinese people. This wise decision will undoubtedly further unite the people of both countries who love lasting peace; thus enabling the people of the two major nations of the East and West to exert greater strength in the struggle against the new war preparations of American and British imperialism, and to make the world's democratic peace camp, led by the Soviet Union, stronger and more consolidated. We are delighted and excited to wish the rapid formal establishment of Sino-German diplomatic relations and the increasing enhancement and development of friendship between the two peoples.
    The proclamation of the German Democratic Republic was hailed by Stalin as a turning point in European history, pointing out that "the co-existence of a peace-loving and democratic Germany with a peace-loving Soviet Union makes new wars in Europe impossible, ends the bloodshed in Europe and makes it impossible for world imperialism to enslave European countries." We know that it has been four and a half years since the end of the war against Hitler's fascist Germany. The German people have always hoped to maintain the unity of the country, to realize the democratization of Germany in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, to eliminate the influence of militarism and to conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible. However, these solemn promises have been subjected to the shameful deception and destruction of American and British imperialism. American and British imperialism are pursuing a policy of division in Germany, supporting the reactionary Bonn puppet government, plundering the German economy in the Ruhr and Saar regions, threatening the survival of the German state, and attempting to make the German people forever slaves of imperialism and cannon fodder for instigating new wars of aggression. This situation is, of course, intolerable to the peace-loving people of Germany, who must actively unite their domestic democratic forces, with the direct help and sympathy of the great socialist country, the Soviet Union, to establish their own unified democratic government. It goes without saying that the existence of a peace-loving and strong democratic Germany is an important contribution to consolidating world peace, which is not only the desire of the German people, but also warmly welcomed and supported by the people of the world.
    The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Germany marks a shameful failure for American and British imperialism in the East and West; and the growth of friendship between the two peoples, and the exchange and development of economic and cultural ties between the two countries, means even greater failures await all warmongers who dare to undermine world peace.

　　中德人民团结起来
    中央人民政府决定与德意志民主共和国建立外交关系，这是全中国人民一致的愿望。这一英明的决定，无疑将使两国爱好持久和平的人民，进一步亲密团结起来；从而使东方与西方两大国家的人民，在反对美英帝国主义新战争准备的斗争中，发挥更伟大的力量，并使以苏联为领导的世界民主和平阵营更加强大与巩固。我们以欢欣鼓舞的心情，谨祝中德邦交迅速地正式建立和两国人民友谊日益增进与发展。
    德意志民主共和国的宣告成立，斯大林曾誉为欧洲历史的转折点，指出“爱好和平的民主的德国与爱好和平的苏联之并肩存在，使得欧洲不再有新战争的可能，结束欧洲的流血并使世界帝国主义民主义奴役欧洲国家成为不可能。”我们知道，从对希特勒法西斯德国战争结束以来，已经四年半之久。德国人民无时不在希望保持国家的统一，希望根据波茨坦协定实现德国民主化，肃清军国主义影响并迅速缔结和约。但这些庄严的许诺，遭受美英帝国主义的可耻欺骗与破坏。美英帝国主义在德国执行着分裂政策，扶植反动的波恩傀儡政府，剥夺鲁尔区和萨尔区的德国经济，威胁着德国国家的生存，妄图使德国人民永远沦为帝国主义的奴隶牛马，作为它挑动新的侵略战争的炮灰。这种情况，当然为德国爱好和平人民所不能忍受，不能不积极团结其国内民主力量，在伟大社会主义国家苏联直接帮助与同情下，建立自己的统一的民主政府。不言而喻，一个爱好和平的强大的民主德国的存在，乃是巩固世界和平的重要贡献，这不仅为德国人民的愿望，抑且为世界人民所热烈欢迎与拥护。
    中德两国建立外交关系，标志着美英帝国主义在东方和西方同遭可耻的失败；而两国人民友谊的增长，两国经济、文化的交流与发展，更意味着更大的失败在等待着一切敢于破坏世界和平的战争贩子们。
