　　Qinghe Woolen Mill Worker
    Liu Yongsheng Rewarded for Fire Prevention
    [Beijing News] Liu Yongsheng, a warehouse worker at the Qinghe Woolen Mill, was rewarded for his proactive fire prevention efforts. On the 18th of this month, when a batch of wool was delivered to the factory, Liu Yongsheng smelled a burning odor. He immediately mobilized everyone to inspect it and found that some of the wool had already caught fire. He immediately put out the fire. The fire was likely caused by sparks from the charcoal truck transporting the wool. Although many people were nearby at the time, no one noticed it. Liu Yongsheng was able to raise his vigilance and immediately conduct an inspection, fully demonstrating his love for the people's property. With the approval of the Industry Bureau, the factory administration specially awarded Liu Yongsheng a woolen overcoat made by the factory in public on the 28th. The trade union also praised him on the blackboard bulletin, calling on everyone to learn from him.

　　清河制呢厂工人　
    刘永升防火受奖
    【北京讯】清河制呢厂仓库工人刘永升，防火积极，获得奖励。本月十八日，该厂运到一批羊毛，在搬运入库时，刘永升嗅着胡味，立刻动员大家检查，果然发现有的羊毛已经烧着，马上把火扑灭。羊毛烧着的原因，可能是运毛的木炭车火星引起的，当时许多人在旁，都没注意，而刘永升能提高警惕，立即检查，充分表现了对人民财产之爱护。经工业局批准，该厂行政上特于前日（廿八）当众奖给刘永升该厂出品之呢大衣一件。工会也在黑板报上表扬，号召大家向他看齐。
