　　[North Anhui News] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army's Third Field Army held a political work conference on the 9th of this month. More than 20 people attended, including political commissars and political section chiefs from various units, and cadres above section level from directly subordinate units. The conference lasted for three days and conducted a detailed discussion on the close integration of the troops with the local areas and vigorous development of local work in the mountainous areas. At the meeting, each unit reported on the situation in its jurisdiction. In most areas, the bandit gangs had been annihilated, and most of the bandit leaders had been captured alive or surrendered. The open activities of large groups of bandits had ceased. The masses had shifted from doubting us to approaching us and reporting information to us. In some areas, they had even begun to demand reasonable burdens. Based on this basic situation, it was believed that in order to eliminate the remaining bandits and eradicate the bandit roots, it was necessary to vigorously carry out mass work to achieve the universal establishment of political power, boldly mobilize the masses, and immediately begin to organize the masses with a focus, so that bandit suppression becomes a mass movement. The meeting also pointed out that since the unit entered the mountains to suppress bandits, it had achieved great success in carrying out mass work. For example, it universally helped the masses with the autumn harvest and widely carried out propaganda, which quickly eliminated all the misunderstandings of the masses about us due to the long-term reactionary propaganda of the bandits and special agents, and their awareness gradually increased. Each unit transferred a total of about 400 cadres to form large and small work teams to assist the local areas, enabling them to quickly establish district and township political power under the spare parts of extremely scarce cadres, and win over and disintegrate a large number of bandits and special agents. However, mass work must be raised to a higher level in the future and must be more organized and unifiedly led. Therefore, everyone believed that the troops must send cadres to participate in local party committees and, under the unified leadership of the local party committees, implement unified work policies and tasks. In addition to sending out work teams specifically to carry out mass work, each unit,机关, and连队 is responsible for doing a good job in the mass work in the駐地. Each leading机关 also has the responsibility to strengthen the leadership of the mass work in the駐地. It is necessary to strengthen the ideological education of the work teams, clarify that the task of bandit suppression is not only a military task but also a political task, and the bandits can only be truly eliminated by mobilizing the masses. It is necessary to strengthen the concept of taking root. Work team members should also strengthen policy and ideological education, and call on each work team member to discover and cultivate local cadres among the masses.

　　根据大别山区新情况　
    三野某部政工会议决定            
    大力开展地方工作发动群众铲除匪根
    【皖北讯】人民解放军第三野战军某部，于本月九日召开政工会议，到各部政治委员，政治处主任，直属队科以上干部二十余人。会议历时三天，对部队密切结合地方、大力开展山区地方工作作了详细讨论。会上各部对所辖地区的情况作了汇报，大部分地区股匪已经歼灭，匪首大部活捉或投降，大股土匪公开的活动已经停止，群众已由对我怀疑而接近，并向我报告情况，部分地区并已开始要求合理负担等。根据这一基本情况，认为今后为了肃清残匪，铲除匪根，必须大力进行群众工作，达到普遍建立政权，放手发动群众，立即着手有重点的组织群众，使剿匪成为群众性的运动。会上并指出该部自进山剿匪以来，对开展群众工作已获得很大成绩，如普遍帮助群众秋收，并广泛开展宣传，使群众因匪特长期反动宣传对我之一切误解迅速消除，觉悟逐渐提高；各部抽调干部共约四百余人，组成大小工作队协助地方，使其在干部极度缺乏的备件下迅速建立了区乡政权，并争取和瓦解了大批匪特。但今后群众工作必须提高一步，必须更有组织、更统一领导。因此大家认为部队必须派出干部参加地方党委，在当地地方党委统一领导下，执行统一的工作方针与任务，各部除派出专门开展群众工作的工作队外，机关、连队有责任做好驻地的群众工作，各领导机关并有加强驻地群众工作的领导责任；对部队必须加强工作队的思想教育，明确剿匪任务不仅是军事任务，更是政治任务，必须把群众发动起来，土匪才能真正肃清。要加强生根观念。工作队员更要加强政策思想教育，要号召每个工作队员在群众中发现和培养地方干部。
