Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 12th. Hubei Province's rural work is being carried out in accordance with the resolutions of the first congress of the Chinese Communist Party held in the province in mid-August. The resolution called on cadres in various regions to eliminate the erroneous ideas of arrogance, complacency, and underestimation of the enemy in the past work of suppressing bandits. In September, various regions successively convened cadre meetings to convey the resolutions of the Party Congress, deploy autumn grain collection tasks, examine ideology, rectify organizations, and discuss methods of implementation based on specific conditions. After the communication and meetings, cadres have further improved in their thinking and understanding. Originally, cadres generally lacked understanding of bandits and were numb and careless. For example, the cadre meeting convened by the Mianyang Prefectural Committee reflected that some cadres regarded bandits as purely economic bandits, neglecting their reactionary class essence and that they were a planned underground armed force deployed by the Kuomintang reactionaries after their military failure. At the same time, they did not understand the essence of the trinity of bandits, secret agents, and local bullies. Some did not understand the policy of suppressing bandits and could not well implement the policy of "the ringleaders must be punished, the coerced are not to be questioned, and meritorious service will be rewarded." Some believed that the local bullies had fled, meaning that their rule over the countryside had collapsed, and thus relaxed the mobilization of the masses for struggle. Some believed that all bandits had been eliminated after they handed over a few guns or did not appear publicly. Some isolated the suppression of bandits, the fight against local bullies, the autumn grain collection, and the mobilization of the masses from each other, and therefore lacked confidence in completing the tasks.

Local leading organs have criticized and corrected the above-mentioned ideas, enabling cadres to recognize their mistakes, affirm the correctness of the provincial Party Congress's policy, and then formulate steps to implement it according to specific circumstances. For example, the Mianyang Prefectural Committee divided the work into four categories of regions according to the different situations in each district: 1. New areas: where feudal rule is strong, focusing on suppressing large groups of bandits, extensively launching political offensives, mobilizing the masses, and opposing large local bully landlords who directly collude with bandits. Relying on the masses and combining with administrative forces to supervise the old Baojia personnel for autumn grain collection. 2. Semi-new areas: focusing on fighting against local bullies, clearing out scattered bandits and hidden bandits, and eradicating bandit roots; abolishing the old Baojia system and establishing people's democratic power through farmers' representative meetings, and carrying out democratic appraisal and struggle for autumn grain collection. 3. Flood-stricken areas: focusing on organizing disaster victims to engage in production for self-rescue and strengthening the construction of dikes, while combining this with launching democratic struggles to oppose local bullies and settle accounts. 4. Towns: mobilizing workers and all working people to restore and develop production, promote trade between urban and rural areas, and pay attention to investigating bandits, secret agents, and local bullies.

　　纠正干部自满麻痹轻敌思想
    湖北加强农村工作
    【新华社汉口十二日电】湖北省的农村工作，正根据该省于八月中旬召开的中国共产党首次党代表会议的决议进行。决议曾号召各地干部肃清过去在剿匪工作中骄傲自满和麻痹轻敌的错误思想。九月中，各地相继召开干部会议，传达党代表会的决议，布置秋征任务，检查思想，整顿组织，根据具体情况讨论贯彻执行的方法。经过传达和会议以后，干部在思想上和认识上有了进一步的提高。原来一般干部对土匪认识不足，麻痹大意，如沔阳地委召开的干部会议中，反映出有把土匪只看成是单纯经济性的贼寇，忽视了它的反动阶级本质，忽视了它是国民党反动派在军事失败之后有计划布置的地下武装，同时也不了解土匪、特务、恶霸三位一体的实质。有的不了解剿匪政策，不能很好执行“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的方针。有的认为恶霸跑了，就是他们对农村的统治已经垮台，因而放松了发动群众斗争。也有的看到土匪交了几支枪或者是没有公开出现，就认为全部肃清了。有的把剿匪、反恶霸、秋征、发动群众等彼此孤立起来，因此对完成任务没有信心。
    各地领导机关对上述的各种思想都进行了批判和纠正，使干部认识到自己的错误，肯定省党代表会方针的正确，进而根据具体情况，定出步骤贯彻执行。如沔阳地委按分区各地不同情况，分成四类地区进行工作：一、崭新区：封建统治较强，以剿灭成股土匪为主，广泛展开政治攻势，发动群众，反对直接通匪的大恶霸地主。并依靠群众，结合行政力量，监督旧保甲人员，进行秋征。二、半新区：以反恶霸、清剿散匪、潜匪、铲除匪根为主；经过农民代表会，废除旧保甲，建立人民民主政权，进行秋征的民主评议斗争。三、水灾区：全力组织灾民生产自救，抓紧修堤，同时结合展开反恶霸清算的民主斗争。四、城镇：发动工人及一切劳动人民恢复和发展生产，沟通城乡贸易，并注意清查土匪特务恶霸。
