　　Profound Internationalist Friendship
    —A Special Feature on the Beijing Rally to See Off the Soviet Delegation
    Lin Wei
    On October 27th, the sun shone high in the sky, and the national flags of China and the Soviet Union fluttered in the wind. Giant portraits of Chairman Mao and Stalin overlooked the masses from under the two countries' flags. The crowd was filled with laughter and joy, brimming with an internationalist friendship as deep as the sea. As the entire assembly stood at attention and sang the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union, this sense of friendship permeated even more strongly into everyone's heart. Mayor Nie, on behalf of everyone, expressed sincere gratitude to the Soviet comrades for their tireless efforts. Simonov sincerely thanked the Chinese people for their warm hospitality. He said that he would tell the Soviet people: the Chinese people are their most honest and most loyal old friends, and the Chinese people call Stalin their best friend with such joy. At this moment, the slogans "Long live Chairman Mao" and "Long live Stalin" resounded through the sky, the majestic military music stirred the air, and two large banners reading "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship" and "Long live Sino-Soviet cooperation" were carried by many people onto the rostrum, followed by a long line of female students holding bouquets.
    In this infinitely joyous moment worthy of permanent commemoration, Chinese and Soviet cameras and movie cameras were busily at work. Bright red flags, beautiful bouquets, Soviet delegation comrades shaking hands intimately with the comrades presenting the flags and flowers one by one, they raised their bouquets and waved them for a long time, tens of thousands of hands clapping frantically for a long time, many people jumping up and throwing their hats and handkerchiefs, ... all these memorable scenes were captured by the two countries' cameras and movie cameras.
    The Soviet comrades specially performed their wonderful musical and dance performances of high artistic value for everyone. These included Kravchenko's piano solo, the solo vocals of Kazanmiva and Minaev, the dances of Dukinskaya and the Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble, and Balinova's violin solo. They were so happy, so pure, so robust. Two workers from the Beijing Clothing Factory watched and commented: "They are really very lovable." Two train attendants from the Qianmen Train Depot, one named Du Yuanxiang and the other named Zhang Xiangjiu, accompanied and hosted the Soviet delegation throughout their journey from Beijing to Nanjing and Shanghai and then back to Beijing. They told reporters that when they went to see a play at the Chinese Grand Theater in Tianjin, the Soviet comrades invited them to ride in the same car. In their daily words and actions, they were treated completely as comrades or friends. When they had free time, they taught them to learn or chatted together. Before leaving, they all signed their names to express their gratitude to the hospitality staff.
    Students from China University said that as soon as the Soviet comrades arrived in China, they went to visit the homes of workers and peasants, and they are the best friends of the Chinese working people. We must learn from them. Li Yi, a student from the Western Language Department of Peking University, said after watching this performance: "In the past, we were never qualified to participate in the highest artistic performances of any country; but the highest-level artists of the Soviet Union are performing in front of the broad masses of people." Xue Shengsan, a soldier from a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army, expressed special concern that the Soviet comrades were singing for us even though their voices were hoarse. He said that he just wanted to stand up and get closer to get to know them, so that he could engrave a permanent image in his mind.
    Many students from Fu Jen Catholic University wrote a joint letter and sent two students to represent them to the rostrum to hand it directly to Simonov. The letter read: "Dearest comrades of the Soviet delegation: After you return to the great Soviet Union, please send us a few badges as a permanent souvenir. We wish you a safe journey and send our regards to Comrade Stalin's health for us." Simonov shook hands with them and sincerely replied: Definitely, definitely.

　　深湛的国际主义友谊
    —北京市欢送苏联代表团大会特写
    林韦
    十月二十七日，太阳照耀在高空，中苏两国的国旗迎风飘扬，毛主席和斯大林的巨像在两国国旗下俯视着黑越越的人群，人群中充溢着欢笑与欣喜，充溢着海水样深厚的国际主义的友谊。在全场肃立合唱中苏两国国歌的时候，这种友谊之感更强烈地渗入每个人的心。聂市长代表大家对苏联同志不辞劳苦表示了真诚的感谢，西蒙诺夫衷心感谢中国人民的热情招待。他说，他要告诉苏联人民：中国人民是他们最老实最忠诚的老朋友，中国人民是以怎样的愉快称斯大林为他们最好的朋友。此时，“毛主席万岁”与“斯大林万岁”的口号响澈云霄，雄壮的军乐声激荡着，“中苏友好万岁”与“中苏合作万岁”的两面大旗被许多人簇拥着奔上主席台来，后面跟着的是一大串抱着花束的女学生。
    在这值得永久纪念的无限欢快的时刻，中国的和苏联的照像机、电影机都十分忙碌地活动着。鲜红的旗帜，美丽的花束，苏联代表团的同志与献旗献花的同志们一一亲密握手，他们高举花束久久地挥舞，几万双手久久地拼命拍着，许多人跳了起来，掷起了帽子和手巾，……这一切值得回忆的镜头，都被收入两国的像机与影机中去。
    苏联同志们特意把他们精彩的具有高度艺术价值的音乐与歌舞演给大家。其中包括克拉夫青柯的钢琴独奏，卡赞米瓦和米拿也夫的独唱，杜金斯卡雅和红军歌舞团的舞蹈，巴利诺瓦的小提琴独奏。他们是那么快活，那么纯真，那么健壮。北京被服厂两个工人一边看，一边议论着：“他们实在可爱得很。”前门车务段有两个列车员，一个叫杜元祥，一个叫张翔久，他们是苏联代表团由京到宁沪、由宁沪又返京的整个旅途的伴随者，招待者。他们对记者说：在天津时到中国大戏院去看戏，便招呼他俩同乘汽车去看。平时一言一动，都是完全当做同志或朋友一样。有了闲空，就教他们学习，或一块聊天。临别时全体签名对招待人员表示感谢。
    华大的学生们说，苏联同志一来中国就去工人和农民的住处去看，他们是中国劳动人民最好的朋友。我们要向他们学习。北大西语系同学郦毅看了此次表演之后，说：“从前无论哪一个国家的最高艺术表演，我们总没资格参加；但苏联的最高等艺术家们却是在广大人民面前演的。”解放军某团战士薛省三，对苏联同志喊哑了嗓子还在为我们演唱表示特别关心。他说，他光想站起来走近点熟悉熟悉他们，好在脑子里刻下永久的影子。
    辅仁女中的好些同学共同写了一封信，当场派两个同学代表她们送上主席台，直交西蒙诺夫。信里写的是：“最亲爱的苏联代表团同志们：你们回到伟大的苏联以后，请寄来几个徽章作为永久的纪念。祝你们一路平安，替我们问候斯大林同志健康。”西蒙诺夫与她们握手，诚挚的回答：一定一定。
