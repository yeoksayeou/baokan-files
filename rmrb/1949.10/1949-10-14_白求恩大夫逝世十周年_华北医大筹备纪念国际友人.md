　　Tenth Anniversary of Dr. Bethune's Death: North China Medical University Prepares to Commemorate International Friend
    [Report from this newspaper] North China Medical University will expand its commemoration of the tenth anniversary of Bethune's death. November 12th is the day the great internationalist, outstanding Canadian Communist Party member, Dr. Norman Bethune, died heroically while helping China in the War of Resistance Against Japan. This year marks the tenth anniversary of his death. In 1938, Dr. Bethune was dispatched by the Party, leading the American-Canadian Medical Team to China. On China's anti-Japanese battlefield, he treated the cause of the Chinese people's liberation as his own, engaging in battlefield rescue and treatment work. Unfortunately, he passed away on November 12, 1939. In order to commemorate this great international friend and strengthen the study of Bethune's work style and great internationalist spirit, North China Medical University will hold a memorial meeting and exhibition, and publish a commemorative publication at that time. A preparatory committee has now been formed and is beginning preparations. (Gu Di)
