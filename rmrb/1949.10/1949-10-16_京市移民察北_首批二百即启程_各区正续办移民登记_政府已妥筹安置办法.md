　　【Beijing News】The Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs is actively carrying out the work of immigrating to Chahar North. The first group of over 200 immigrants registered in various districts will leave Beijing for Chahar on the 19th of this month. In order to introduce the situation in Chahar North and strengthen the immigrants' thinking on settling down and building their careers in Chahar North, the district offices have been gathering household heads since yesterday (the 15th) to conduct study. Registration is still being processed in all districts. It is expected that 3,000 people may immigrate by the beginning of November when this work comes to an end. The Chahar side has also formed the Chahar Province Disaster Relief Committee to engage in the resettlement of immigrants. The government is responsible for providing the required transportation and food expenses for going to Chahar, and cotton clothes and shoes will be issued to those who are particularly poor. After arriving in Chahar, the Chahar Provincial Government will send them to various villages to engage in winter sideline production, and they will be able to participate in land reclamation and canal construction in the spring. The government will provide loans as production capital for the first year of immigration (a total of eleven months from this winter to next autumn); the scope of the loan includes food, farming tools, seeds, livestock, and fur clothing. They will be completely self-sufficient in the second year and will begin to repay one-third of the government loan annually in millet without interest until the fourth year when the loan will be fully repaid.
