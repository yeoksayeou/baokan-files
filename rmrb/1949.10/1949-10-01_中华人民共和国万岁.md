　　The infinitely bright People's Republic of China has been born. Four hundred and seventy-five million Chinese people have begun to manage the country as masters of their own destiny. Our ancient Eastern nation has opened a new, grand chapter in history.

　　The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, representing the people of the whole country and exercising the functions and powers of the National People's Congress, has concluded today. The main tasks of this conference were threefold: first, to adopt the Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Organic Law of the Central People's Government, and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; second, to elect the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and members of the Central People's Government Committee, and to elect the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; and third, to decide on the capital, national anthem, and method of reckoning years, and to formulate the national flag. The great achievements of this conference have been extensively discussed in the speeches of the representatives. Here, we would like to offer some opinions on the three documents adopted by the conference.

　　The Common Program adopted by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is a concentrated expression of the will and interests of the people of the whole country, a summary of the experience of revolutionary struggle, and a guideline for the administration of the People's Republic of China for a considerable period of time. This Common Program stipulates that our People's Republic of China is a state of New Democracy, that is, People's Democracy; that the political power is the people's democratic united front regime of the Chinese working class, the peasantry, the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie, and other patriotic democratic elements, based on the worker-peasant alliance and led by the working class; that the goal is to oppose imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, and to strive for China's independence, democracy, peace, unity and prosperity. It sets the general principles for the political structure, military system, as well as economic, cultural, educational, ethnic, and foreign policies for our newborn China. It guarantees the broad democratic rights of all the people of China and also stipulates several obligations that everyone must abide by. This was originally the minimum program of the Chinese Communist Party, that is, the New Democratic Program, and now it has been unanimously accepted by all democratic parties, people's organizations, democratic classes, ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic elements, becoming the blueprint for the construction of the New China. This blueprint fully conforms to China's national conditions and the people's ideals. In fact, it is no longer just an ideal, because the Chinese people have long been, especially since the Anti-Japanese War, working on building according to its basic outline, and have already achieved victorious results and rich experience. With this historical foundation, with the unified leadership of the people's governments at all levels throughout the country, with the unanimous support of all democratic parties and people's organizations, and with the loyal guarantee of the powerful People's Liberation Army, we believe that this program will be fully realized in the next few years.

　　The basic feature of the Organic Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the provision that: "The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, based on the alliance of workers and peasants, and uniting all democratic classes and nationalities within China." "The government of the People's Republic of China is a government of the people's congress system based on the principle of democratic centralism." (See Chapters 1 and 2 of the General Principles of the Law) This is the New Democratic regime. It is different from the old bourgeois democratic regime. Because the old bourgeois democratic regime is the dictatorship of a single class, the bourgeoisie, and is a tool for oppressing the broad masses of the people. The bourgeois parliamentary system and the separation of powers are only intended to facilitate the struggle for power and profit-sharing among different factions within the ruling class; at the same time, it is also intended to facilitate the ruling class to play political tricks, deceive and exploit the working people. Our New Democratic regime is also not entirely the same as the Soviet socialist regime and the people's democratic regimes of Eastern European countries. The Soviet Union is a socialist country that has eliminated classes, and its regime is an alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. Eastern European countries are realizing socialism. The New Democratic regime in China has the participation of four classes: the working class, the peasantry, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. However, the current New Democratic regime in China is the same as the socialist regime of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic regimes of Eastern European countries in that it belongs to the world anti-imperialist camp, with the revolutionary party of the working class as the leading force and the implementation of democratic centralism. In the democratic centralism of China's New Democracy, "the organs through which the people exercise state power are the people's congresses at all levels and the people's governments at all levels. The people's congresses at all levels are elected by the people by universal suffrage. The people's congresses at all levels elect the people's governments at all levels. During the adjournment of the people's congresses at all levels, the people's governments at all levels are the organs exercising political power at all levels. The highest organ of state power is the National People's Congress. During the adjournment of the National People's Congress, the Central People's Government is the highest organ exercising state power." "The People's Congress is responsible to the people and reports its work to the people. The People's Government Committee is responsible to the People's Congress and reports its work to the People's Congress. In the People's Congress and the People's Government Committee, the system of the minority obeying the majority is implemented. The people's governments at all lower levels are appointed by and subordinate to the people's governments at higher levels. The people's governments at all levels throughout the country are subordinate to the Central Government." (See Articles 12 and 15 of the Common Program) This is a high degree of centralization on a highly democratic basis, the most genuine people's democracy, which is absolutely incomparable to the hypocritical democracy of the bourgeoisie.

　　The adoption of the Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference marks the organizational completion of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front. This united front has broad representation, and its organizational components include representatives of the working class, the peasantry, revolutionary soldiers, intellectuals, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic elements; but it also has a high degree of seriousness, and all reactionary elements are not allowed to participate. The purpose of forming this united front has been stated in the general principles of the law, which is to unite all democratic classes and nationalities in China through the unity of all democratic parties and people's organizations, and work together to implement the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference. A high degree of democracy is practiced within this united front. If participating units have different opinions on the resolutions passed by the plenary sessions of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the National Committee, they may reserve them for discussion at the next session, and if they fundamentally disagree with important resolutions, they have the freedom to apply for withdrawal; but on the other hand, it also has strict discipline. Participating units and representatives have the obligation to abide by and implement the resolutions passed by the plenary sessions of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the National Committee, and those who violate the Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Common Program, or important resolutions and whose circumstances are serious may be punished accordingly. This Chinese People's Democratic United Front organization - the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference - exercised the functions and powers of the National People's Congress before the convocation of the National People's Congress elected by universal suffrage, and will continue to exist for a long time after the convocation of the National People's Congress, becoming a form of unity and a consultative body for all democratic parties and people's organizations. It will establish a National Committee elected by the plenary session, and establish local committees in central cities, important areas, and provincial capitals to continue its activities. For the past twenty-eight years, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people have consistently advocated the establishment of a national united front. During the First Great Revolution, the Chinese Communist Party established such a cooperative relationship with Mr. Sun Yat-sen, thereby promoting the Chinese people's revolution and launching the victorious Northern Expedition on this basis. After Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal, the Chinese Communist Party still adhered to the policy of the revolutionary united front. After the twists and turns of the land revolutionary war and the anti-Japanese war, a new and unprecedentedly powerful people's democratic united front has now been formed under the new situation. This new united front has the universally recognized leading position of the Chinese Communist Party, the unprecedented level of awareness and organizational strength of the Chinese people for supervision, and the Common Program and the Organic Law of the People's Political Consultative Conference as common regulations to be observed and followed, which is sufficient to fully guarantee its consolidation and soundness.

　　The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has completed its work very well. It has formulated the fundamental law of the country for the people of the whole country and elected the Central People's Government headed by Chairman Mao Zedong. Now, what are the tasks before the people of our country? Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, closely unite around the Central People's Government, implement the Common Program and other resolutions of the conference without compromise, and turn them into practical actions of the masses. It is to supervise the people's governments at all levels and all democratic parties and people's organizations to faithfully fulfill these fundamental laws of the country, so that the will of the people can rapidly and step by step become the reality of the country. It is to assist the government, to carry the revolution through to the end, to eliminate the overt and hidden counter-revolutionary remnants, to heal the wounds of war, to restore and develop the people's economic and cultural education undertakings, to consolidate national defense, and to make our new China prosperous and strong. It is to cherish our newborn motherland, to strengthen the strength of the people's democratic government, and to unite with the peace-loving and democratic countries and peoples headed by the Soviet Union, in order to safeguard the fruits of the Chinese people's revolutionary victory and promote world peace and freedom. Long live the People's Republic of China!

### 中华人民共和国万岁

专栏：社论

　　中华人民共和国万岁
    前程无限光辉的中华人民共和国已经诞生，四万万七千五百万中国人民开始自己当权管理国家，我们这个古老的东方民族揭开了历史的新的巨册。
    中国人民政治协商会议，代表全国人民，执行全国人民代表大会的职权，在今天已经闭幕。这个会议的主要工作有三类：一是通过了人民政协组织法，中央人民政府组织法和人民政协共同纲领；二是选举了中央人民政府委员会的主席、副主席和委员，选举了人民政协全国委员会；三是决定了国都、国歌和纪年方法，制定了国旗。这个会议的伟大成就，会上各位代表的发言中已经说得很多。这里我们对会议所通过的三个文件说一些意见。
    中国人民政治协商会议所通过的共同纲领，是全国人民意志和利益的集中表现，是革命斗争经验的总结，也是中华人民共和国在相当长的时期内的施政准则。这个共同纲领规定我们中华人民共和国是新民主主义即人民民主主义的国家；政权是中国工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级及其他爱国民主分子的人民民主统一战线政权，而以工农联盟为基础，以工人阶级为领导；目标是反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，为中国的独立、民主、和平、统一和富强而奋斗。它给我们新生的中国，订定了政权机构、军事制度以及经济政策、文化教育政策、民族政策、外交政策的总原则。它保障了全中国人民广大范围的民主权利，也规定了人人必须遵守的若干义务。这原本是中国共产党的最低纲领，即新民主主义纲领，现在已被各民主党派、各人民团体、各民主阶级、各少数民族、海外华侨及其他爱国民主分子所一致接受，成为新中国的建设蓝图。这个蓝图，完全切合中国的国情和人民的理想。事实上它已经不只是一个理想，因为中国人民很久以来，特别是从抗日战争以来，就已在按照它的基本轮廓动手从事建筑，而且已经获得胜利的成果和丰富的经验了。有了这个历史的基础，有了全国各级人民政府的统一领导，有了全国各民主党派各人民团体的一致支持，和强大的人民解放军的忠贞保障，我们相信这个纲领一定能在最近数年内完满地实现。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法，其基本特点是规定：“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的，团结各民主阶级及中国境内各民族的人民民主专政的国家。”“中华人民共和国政府是基于民主集中原则的人民代表大会制的政府。”（见该法总纲第一、二两章）这是新民主主义的政权。它不同于资产阶级的旧民主主义政权。因为旧民主主义政权是资产阶级一个阶级的专政，是压迫广大人民的工具。资产阶级的议会制度和三权分立办法，其目的只是为了便利于统治阶级内部不同的派别之间争权夺利、分脏肥私；同时也是为了便利于统治阶级玩弄政治手腕，欺骗和压榨劳动人民。我们的新民主主义政权也不完全相同于苏联的社会主义政权和东欧各国的人民民主政权。苏联是一个已经消灭了阶级的社会主义国家，它的政权是工人、农民和知识分子的联盟。东欧各国正在实现社会主义。而中国的新民主主义政权则有工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级四个阶级参加。但是，在属于世界反帝国主义阵营，以工人阶级的革命政党为领导力量和实行民主集中制这几点上，中国现在的新民主主义政权，却是与苏联的社会主义政权和东欧各国人民民主政权相同的。在中国新民主主义的民主集中制中，“人民行使国家政权的机关为各级人民代表大会和各级人民政府。各级人民代表大会由人民用普选方法产生之。各级人民代表大会选举各级人民政府。各级人民代表大会闭会期间，各级人民政府为行使各级政权的机关。国家最高政权机关为全国人民代表大会。全国人民代表大会闭会期间，中央人民政府为行使国家政权的最高权力机关。”“人民代表大会向人民负责并报告工作。人民政府委员会向人民代表大会负责并报告工作。在人民代表大会和人民政府委员会内，实行少数服从多数的制度。各下级人民政府均由上级人民政府加委并服从上级人民政府。全国各级人民政府均服从中央政府。”（见共同纲领第十二条和第十五条）这是高度民主基础上的高度集中，最真正的人民民主，是资产阶级虚伪的民主所绝对不可比拟的。
    中国人民政治协商会议组织法的通过，标志着中国人民民主统一战线在组织上的完成。这个统一战线具有广大的代表性，其组织成份包括工人阶级、农民阶级、革命军人、知识分子、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级、少数民族、国外华侨及其他爱国民主分子的代表；但又具有高度的严肃性，一切反动分子不被允许参加。结成这个统一战线的宗旨，已在该法的总则表明，就是经过各民主党派和人民团体的团结去团结全中国各民主阶级，各民族，共同努力，实行人民政协的共同纲领。这个统一战线内部实行高度民主，凡参加单位对中国人民政协全体会议及全国委员会所通过的决议，如有不同意见，得保留至下届会议提出讨论，而对重要决议根本不同意时，且有声请退出的自由；但另一方面，又具有严格纪律，凡参加单位及代表对中国人民政协全体会议及全国委员会所通过的决议，均有信守及实行的义务，如有违反中国人民政协组织法、共同纲领或重要决议而情节严重者，得分别予以处分。这个中国人民民主统一战线组织——中国人民政治协商会议，在普选的全国人民代表大会召开以前，代行了全国人民代表大会的职权，而在人民代表大会召开以后，仍将长期地存在，成为各民主党派，各人民团体团结的形式和协商的机关。它将由全体会议产生全国委员会，并在中心城市、重要地区及省会，设立地方委员会，继续进行活动。中国共产党和中国人民二十八年来一向主张建立民族统一战线。第一次大革命时，中国共产党即曾与孙中山先生建立这种合作关系，因而能够推动中国人民革命，并在此基础上举行胜利的北伐战争。在蒋介石叛变以后，中国共产党仍然坚持革命统一战线的方针。经过土地革命战争时期和抗日战争时期的曲折发展，现在才在新的形势下，结成新的空前强大的人民民主统一战线。这个新的统一战线，有着中国共产党的被众所公认的领导地位，有着中国人民的空前的觉悟程度和组织力量的监督，而又有着共同纲领和人民政协的组织法作为共同信守遵行的章则，这就足以充分地保证它的巩固和健全了。
    中国人民政治协商会议已经完成了很好的工作。它为全国人民制定了国家的根本大法，选举了以毛泽东主席为首的中央人民政府。现在，放在我们全国人民面前的任务是什么呢？是在中国共产党领导之下，紧紧地团结在中央人民政府周围，不折不扣地执行共同纲领和大会其他决议，使它们变成群众的实际行动。是监督各级人民政府和一切民主党派、人民团结忠实地履行这些国家的根本大法，使人民的意志得以迅速地而又有步骤地成为国家的现实。是协助政府，把革命进行到底，肃清公开的和隐藏的反革命残余力量，治愈战争的创伤，恢复和发展人民的经济事业和文化教育事业，巩固国防，使我们新中国富强起来。是爱护我们新生的祖国，加强人民民主政府的力量，和以苏联为首的爱好和平民主的国家和人民团结在一起，以保障中国人民革命胜利的果实，并促进世界的和平与自由。中华人民共和国万岁！
