Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th. Comrade Zhu De, Vice Chairman, delivered a speech today at the preparatory meeting of the All-China Sports Federation. The full text is as follows:

Comrades!

　　I am here today on behalf of the Central People's Government and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission to extend my congratulations to the preparatory meeting of the All-China Sports Federation. This time, the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference clearly stipulates that "national sports should be promoted." Sports is a part of cultural and educational work and also a part of health care. Our Central People's Government attaches great importance to it.

　　In the past, sports were divorced from the broad masses of the people. Now, our sports cause must serve the people and serve the interests of national defense and national health. Not only students, but also workers, farmers, urban residents, the army, government agencies, and organizations must engage in sports. In addition to track and field events, ball games, and other sports, we must also widely adopt many original folk sports forms and sports forms developed by the People's Liberation Army, and we must learn from the good experiences of the Soviet Union in sports.

　　Comrades, the People's Republic of China has been established, and the consciousness of the Chinese people has been universally enhanced. I hope that comrades in the sports field will strive for progress and cultivate themselves to become sports workers of the people. I hope that everyone, under the leadership of the People's Government, will work hard to develop the sports cause, and train our people into people who are physically healthy and mentally happy, so that they can better engage in production, study, and work, and can undertake the arduous task of building a new China.

　　In the two drafts "Merchant Shipping Bureau's Hai Liao Ship Declares Break Away from the Reactionary Government" and "Chairman Mao's Telegram Reply to All Personnel of Hai Liao Ship" issued on the 24th (published on page 1 of this newspaper on the 25th), the captain of the Hai Liao Ship, "Fang Linliu" should be "Fang Zhenliu". Please correct.

　　在全国体总筹备会议上　
    朱副主席讲话全文
    【新华社北京二十六日电】朱德副主席今日在中华全国体育总会筹备会议上的讲话，全文如下：同志们！
    我今天代表中央人民政府和人民革命军事委员会来向全国体育总会筹备会致贺。这一次中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领里面，明文规定要“提倡国民体育”。体育是文化教育工作的一部分，也是卫生保健的一部分，我们中央人民政府对它是重视的。
    过去的体育，是和广大人民群众脱离的。现在我们的体育事业，一定要为人民服务，要为国防和国民健康的利益服务。不但是学生，而且工人、农民、市民、军队、机关和团体都要搞体育。除去田径赛、打球等项以外，还要广泛地采用民间原有的许多体育形式和人民解放军所发展的体育形式，要学习苏联体育方面的好的经验。
    同志们，中华人民共和国已经建立，中国人民的觉悟普遍地提高了，希望体育界的同志们，力求进步，培植自己成为人民的体育工作者。希望大家在人民政府领导下，努力发展体育事业，把我们的国民都锻炼成为身体健康、精神愉快的人，这样才能更好地从事生产学习和工作，才能担当起繁重的新中国建设的任务。
    二十四日发“招商局海辽轮宣布脱离反动政府”及“毛主席电复海辽轮全体人员”两稿中（载本报二十五日一版）海辽轮船长“方林流”均应为“方枕流”，请更正。
