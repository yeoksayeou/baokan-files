Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 16th: More than 1,900 stretcher-bearer laborers from five counties in Shanxi Province—Xi, Da Ning, Yonghe, Fen, and Xinjiang—who followed the army to liberate Northwest China, have returned east after successfully completing their mission. When a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army was ordered to advance from Taiyuan to the Northwest, these stretcher-bearer teams from the five counties set out in June to follow the army and carry out the task of supporting the front lines in the liberation of Northwest China.

　　Over the past four months, the laborers and the People's Liberation Army have fought across the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. With a lofty spirit of patriotism and the indomitable spirit of the working people, they overcame various difficulties, passed through the sparsely populated and extremely water-scarce Lin You mountainous area, and crossed the Liupan Mountains, which are 2,000 meters above sea level and 230 li long. They often braved wind and rain, closely following the People's Liberation Army to pursue the Ma bandits. They also successfully completed the task of transporting the wounded in the battles around San Guankou and the outskirts of Lanzhou.

　　On October 6th, the Mid-Autumn Festival, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army held a farewell meeting in Pingluo County, a hundred li north of Yinchuan City. The leaders of the military encouraged the laborers to bring the spirit of hard work and serving the people, which they had cultivated over the past four months, back to North China to engage in the great construction and production undertakings of the new China. The unit also presented several silk banners with inscriptions such as "Meritorious Assistance in Battle" and "Model of Support for the Front."

　　Encouraged by the victorious liberation of Northwest China and the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, all the laborers were extremely excited. During their journey back east, they were respected and cared for by the people of the newly liberated areas.
