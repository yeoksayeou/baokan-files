　  The Object, Tasks, and Characteristics of Political Economy Research
        Chapter One: Mode of Production
        Section One: Productive Forces
    Means of labor can be made of a simple thing, or a complex one, that is, composed of several or even ten, hundreds, or thousands of things. Therefore, Marx said that it is "a complex of one or more things." (Ibid.) Simple means of labor, such as knives, forks, sticks, clubs, plows, hoes, hammers, drills, etc., are made or composed of one or two objects, and they are generally called tools. The latter, such as spinning wheels, cotton gins, and various machines, are more complex.
    Using means of labor to labor is the characteristic of human labor.
    The use of tools created by humans, that is, the use of means of labor to labor, is the characteristic of human labor and the fundamental difference between human labor and animal activity. The use and creation of means of labor can be seen in some animals in their infancy, such as chimpanzees being able to take sticks, and monkeys being able to use stones to smash hard shells. They even have some manufacturing or processing, such as chimpanzees removing leaves from branches. But fundamentally, the use and creation of means of labor are, after all, the characteristics of human labor and the fundamental characteristics that distinguish humans from other animals, as Marx said: "The use and creation of means of labor, although in its rudimentary state it is an attribute of certain animals, is specifically the characteristic of the human labor process." (Ibid.)
    Tools are the extension, expansion, increase, strengthening, and sharpening of human natural organs.
    The manufacture of tools is a major advance for mankind. People's labor, if not with the help of means of labor, is often impossible to carry out, or even if carried out, does not generate great efficiency, or is not carried out completely. Therefore, people can only use the tools they have manufactured to carry out labor and improve productivity. Tools, in their original state, are the extension, expansion, increase, strengthening, and sharpening of the natural organs growing on the human body. For example, if a person's hand is short and wants to pick fruit from a tree but cannot reach it, he must use a stick to knock it down, or use a hook to hook it down, which is the extension of human natural organs. For example, when people drive nails, they must use an ax to hit them, and when pulling nails, they must use pliers to clamp them, and when piercing things, they use an awl. If they only use their hands, it will not work, or it will not be efficient. This is the strengthening and sharpening of human natural organs. The sticks, bows and arrows, and spears used for primitive hunting are not only an extension of the human hand, but also its expansion, strengthening, and even sharpening. Some tools are much larger in volume and more complex in structure than the natural organs of the human body. For example, in the tools used for spinning thread, people used to twist it by hand in primitive times, and further used a hammer to twist it. Later, a wooden hand-cranked spinning wheel was invented, which had a more complex structure and a larger volume. At the same time, productivity has also been greatly improved.
    As mentioned above, tools, in their original state, are the extension, expansion, increase, strengthening, and sharpening of human natural organs. However, although the natural organs of the human body, this natural tool, can also change and develop (such as the hands, feet, and muscles of laborers being more developed than those of non-laborers), the development of natural organs is subject to physiological limitations, and they cannot develop further after they have developed to a certain limit. For example, there is a kind of soldier ant whose head is particularly large and its teeth are particularly large and sharp. It is very fierce in combat, but the development of its head can only reach the extent that its body can carry it, and it is impossible to grow larger. For example, a horse uses its tail to swat flies, so its tail is quite developed, but if it were to grow longer, it would drag on the ground and hinder its movement. Therefore, the development of this natural organ that can be used as a tool—extension, expansion, increase, strengthening, sharpening—is limited. But when using means of labor to labor, and with the creation, improvement and development of means of labor, there is no such restriction, or it is not subject to this restriction.
    The use and improvement of means of labor are all for the purpose of meeting the needs and convenience of human labor, and all for the purpose of improving productivity.
    The creation and use of means of labor, especially tools, can improve productivity. At the same time, if tools can be constantly improved and reformed, it will also have a great effect on improving productivity. Tools are constantly created and improved, and productivity is constantly improved and developed accordingly. For example, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the hand-cranked spinning wheel in Yan'an could spin six liang to half a jin of cotton thread a day, but the small-wheeled spinning wheel in Wayao Fort could only spin three qian and six fen per hour, and only three or four liang of thread a day. The original hand-twisted thread in Shexian area could twist at most two liang a day, while the improved tool in the Taihang area—the foot-pedal spinning machine—could spin one to two jin per person per day, and the hand-cranked spinning machine could shake eight to twelve or more spindles. The productivity of the accelerated spinning wheel is also greatly improved compared to the old-fashioned hand-cranked spinning wheel. (To be continued)

　　政治经济学教程绪论（４）
    王学文
　  政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
        第一章　生产方式
        第一节　生产力
    劳动手段，有简单的一件东西造成的，也有复杂的，即由几件以至内十、几百、几千件东西复合组成的，所以马克思说它是“一物或诸物的复合体。”（同上）简单的劳动手段，例如刀、杈、棒、棍、犁、锄、锤、钻等等，都是一件或两件物件制成或组成的，它们一般就叫做工具。后者，如纺车、弹花机、以及各种机器，就都比较复杂了。
    使用劳动手段进行劳动，是人类劳动的特征
    人类使用他们所创造出来的工具，即使用劳动手段来进行劳动，是人类劳动的特点，是人类劳动与动物活动的根本区别。劳动手段的使用与创造，在其他某些动物中已见其萌芽，例如猩猩能拿棍子，猴子能用石头砸硬壳，它们甚至还有某些制造或加工，例如猩猩把树枝除去叶子等。但是根本上，劳动手段的使用和创造，毕竟是人类劳动的特点，也是人类区别于其他动物的根本特征，正如马克思所说：“劳动手段的使用与创造，虽在萌芽状态已成为某种动物的属性，但特为人类劳动过程的特征。”（同上）
    工具是人身自然器官的延长、扩大、增加、加强和尖锐化
    制造工具是人类的一大进步。人们的劳动如果不借助于劳动手段，往往是无法进行，或者即使进行而不发生大的效率，或者进行得不完全。故人们只有使用他所制造的工具，才能进行劳动，才能使生产力提高。工具依其原始状态说来，是人类驱体上生长的自然器官的延长、扩大、增加、加强和尖锐化。例如人的手短，想摘取树上的果子达不到，须用棍棒把它打下来，或用摘钩钩下来，这便是人类自然器官的延长。又如人们钉钉子，必须要用斧子打，拔钉子必须要用钳子钳，锥东西用锥子，如果只用手就不行，或者不发生效率，这就是人类自然器官的加强，尖锐化。原始狩猎用的棍子弓箭和投枪等，也已不只是人手的延长，而已是它的扩大、加强，甚至于尖锐化了。有的工具，其体积比起人身自然器官的体积来要大得多，其结构也要复杂得多。如纺线使用的工具，原始时代人们都用手捻，进一步用锤子捻，以后发明木制手摇纺车，其构造就比较复杂，其体积也比较庞大了。同时生产力也大为提高了。
    既如上述，工具依其原始状态言，是人身自然器官的延长、扩大、增加、加强和尖锐化。然而人身自然器官这一天然的工具虽然也是能够变化发展的（如劳动者的手、脚、筋肉都比不劳动者为发达），可是自然器官的发展是受着生理的限制，它们发展到一定限度也就不可能再发展下去了。例如蚂蚁中有一种兵蚁，头特别大，牙也特别大而锐利，战斗时很凶猛，但它头的发展只能达到它躯体所能搬运的程度，再大也就不可能了。又如马用它的尾巴打苍蝇，因此尾巴相当发达，但如要再长一些，就会拖到地下妨碍行动了。因此，这种能作工具使用的自然器官的发展——延长、扩大、增加、加强、尖锐化是有限度的。但使用劳动手段进行劳动时，与劳动手段的创造改良与发展，那就没有这种限制，或不受这种限制了。
    劳动手段的使用改良都是为了适合人类劳动的需要便利都是为了提高生产力。
    劳动手段，首先是工具的创造使用，都是可以提高生产力的。同时工具如果能够经常不断地改进改良，对于提高生产力也是有大的作用的。工具不断地创造改进，生产力亦随着不断地提高发展。例如抗战时期延安的手摇纺车一天能纺六两到半斤的棉线，但瓦窑堡的小轮纺车一小时只能纺三钱六，一天才能纺三四两线。涉县一带原始的手捻线，一天最多能捻二两，而太行区的改良工具——脚蹬纺纱机，每天一人却能纺一斤到二斤，手摇纺机能摇动八个至十二个以上纺缍的。加速的纺车较诸旧式手摇纺车的生产力也大为提高了。（未完）
