Xinhua News Agency, Jiuquan, 10th.—Before the liberation of the entire Gansu Province, the personnel of the pseudo-Gansu Provincial Government and the pseudo-governments at all levels in the Hexi Corridor, who had fled to Jiuquan and Hami in Xinjiang, have been registering with the Political Affairs Department of the Jiuquan Military Control Commission to await disposition. From September 29th to October 3rd, a total of 503 people registered in five days, including Ding Yizhong, Secretary-General and Acting Chairman of the pseudo-Gansu Provincial Government, Guan Yongji, Deputy Director of the Kuomintang Provincial Party Department and Head of the pseudo-Provincial Finance Department, Ma Jizhou, Head of the Civil Affairs Department, Song Ke, Head of the Education Department, Luo Lixue, Head of the Construction Department, and Fu Zhilai, Wang Weiyong, and He Shiying, Commissioners of the pseudo-Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Administrative Inspectorates, and others below them. Most of the middle and lower-level personnel were abandoned in the Jiuquan area when the pseudo-Provincial Government fled to Xinjiang in a panic. After the establishment of the Jiuquan Military Control Commission, they registered with the Political Affairs Department. Ding Yizhong, the Secretary-General and Acting Chairman of the pseudo-Provincial Government, and the above-mentioned four department heads, etc., fled to Hami. Due to the peaceful settlement of Xinjiang, they had nowhere to escape and returned to Jiuquan on the 2nd of this month to register with the Military Control Commission and surrender themselves.
