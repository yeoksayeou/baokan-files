Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 21st: The CCP Central Committee East China Bureau and Shanghai Municipal Committee yesterday sent a telegram congratulating the liberation of Xiamen. The telegram reads as follows:

　　To Comrades Zhang Dingcheng, Ye Fei, Wei Guoqing, and through them to all commanders and fighters on the front lines:

　　We celebrate your great victory in liberating Xiamen! Xiamen is an important military and commercial port on the southeastern coast of our country. The liberation of Xiamen not only shattered the remnant bandits' fantasy of relying on coastal islands for a final struggle, but also deprived Taiwan of its last shield. Your cross-sea operation, rapid destruction of the remnant bandits' modernized fortifications, and occupation of the entire island once again demonstrated the People's Liberation Army's heroic and skilled nature, repaying the people's ardent expectations. We hope you will continue to work hard and strive to complete the liberation of all of Fujian and Taiwan!

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 21st: The Headquarters and Political Department of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army yesterday sent a telegram congratulating the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front for the great victory of liberating Xiamen, stating:

　　After the liberation of Xiamen, Fujian will soon be entirely liberated. Chiang Kai-shek's dream of using Taiwan as the final nest for his struggle will be shattered even more quickly due to the liberation of Xiamen. The complete liberation of all of East China and all of China is not far off. We hope that you will fight more bravely, continue to work hard, eliminate the remnant bandits, build new areas, consolidate coastal defense and urban and rural security, protect the people's acquired interests, and strive to cooperate with fraternal corps to liberate Taiwan.
