Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th Dispatch: According to TASS, Paris: Despite the incessant persecution by the police and the authorities, the French people's peace voting movement is still proceeding enthusiastically. According to French newspapers, the police are constantly persecuting people participating in the voting throughout the country. Two postal workers in the Hautes-Alpes province—union leaders Lacabir and Boasi—were even dismissed by the police department for actively participating in the organization of the peace vote. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress also reported that police provocations against the peace movement had occurred repeatedly in French North Africa, especially in Algiers and Morocco. But despite these provocations, the peace vote continues to be a victory throughout France. According to preliminary statistics, 3,384,183 people in 54 provinces have cast peace ballots. At the same time, according to the French Communist Party newspaper "L'Humanité," more than 90 percent of the residents in some areas cast peace ballots; in some areas, even all residents cast peace ballots.

　　法国人民不顾反动当局迫害
    三百余万人投和平票
    有些地区全部居民参加投票
    【新华社北京十三日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：不顾警察与当局的无休止迫害，法国人民和平投票运动仍热烈进行中。据法国报纸报道，警察不断迫害各地参加投票的人民，上阿尔卑斯省两个邮局职员——工会领袖拉卡比尔和布阿西竟遭警察厅撤职，就因他们积极参加和平投票的组织工作。世界和平大会常委会消息亦称，法属北非屡次发生警察对和平运动的挑衅，特别是在阿尔及尔和摩洛哥。但尽管有这些挑衅，和平投票仍在全法各地胜利继续中。根据初步统计，在五十四个省中已有三百三十八万四千一百八十三人投和平票。同时据法共机关报“人道报”称，若干地区百分之九十以上的居民投了和平票；有些地区甚至全部居民都投和平票。
