Chahar Province, Yanggao County, due to poor management of the grain depot, more than 110,000 catties of grain were damaged. The director of the grain depot did not properly hand over responsibilities when transferred, and the new director was unaware of the location of the grain depot; the provincial government's instructions to pay attention to inspection and repairs were also not seriously implemented. During the summer rainy season, 54 out of 73 warehouses leaked, and five collapsed. Sixty rice sacks were rained on for five days, rotting and becoming poisonous, but no one cared. The landlord, Wen Wanfu's mother, braved the rain to report to the grain depot, but the grain depot cadres ignored her. After Wen's mother raised the serious criticism for the second time, "Public grain is used to support the soldiers, why don't you care?", they still didn't pay enough attention and only sent someone to inspect it carelessly and bought straw mats to cover it. It was not until the warehouses were collapsing that cadres and the masses were mobilized to salvage the grain overnight, but more than 110,000 catties of grain had already been damaged.

In response, the Chahar Provincial People's Government made the following decisions: Shi Baozhen, the county magistrate of Yanggao County, was indifferent to grain work, resulting in such a serious loss. He should have been dismissed, but in view of his serious efforts in the rescue, he was given a major demerit as a lenient punishment. Zheng Wenhuan, the chief of the finance section, and Li Jitang, the deputy chief, neglected grain storage, did not pay attention to warehouse repairs, and did not conduct regular inspections, resulting in losses. Zheng Wenhuan was dismissed, and Li Jitang was given a demerit. Li Yuankui, the director of the grain depot, Lan Chenghao, the former director (who is still working in the depot), and Liu Yingpei (who has been transferred elsewhere) neglected storage inspections and ignored Wen's mother's report. Li Yuankui was dismissed, Lan Chenghao was given a major demerit, and Liu Yingpei was given a demerit. Zhang Jing, a cadre of the provincial government, was responsible for supply tasks in the county but did not inspect the county's grain depot. Although he contributed significantly to the rescue, he should still be criticized. The Yanbei Special Commissioner's Office should also seriously review this matter.

Wang Guilan, the district chief of the seventh district, and Yu Mao, the financial and grain assistant of the ninth district, led the masses to rescue the grain overnight and were commended throughout the county. Wen Wanfu's mother discovered the warehouse leaks and reported them twice in the rain, demonstrating a high level of concern for state property. In addition to being commended throughout the county, she will also be given a material reward. In addition to approving the above handling measures, the North China People's Government ordered the Chahar Provincial Government to quickly implement public grain management methods and strengthen inspections to avoid further grain damage.

Furthermore, the Fengtai West Warehouse caught fire on April 19th of this year, resulting in the loss of summer clothing and other items, worth approximately 10 million yuan in People's currency at the current market price. The cause was also poor management and lax inspections by Li Shirong, the director of the warehouse, and Zhang Jing, the person in charge of the West Warehouse. There was no thorough plan, inadequate fire prevention preparations, and smoking workers were not prohibited, leading to a fire that caused significant damage to state property. The Ministry of Finance did not have an in-depth understanding of the warehouse's management situation and did not provide specific instructions for fire and theft prevention. The North China People's Government has ordered the ministry to review the situation, educate its subordinates, raise vigilance, and strengthen work responsibility. Zhang Jing was given a warning, while Li Shirong, who is under the leadership of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region, will be dealt with appropriately by that department.

　　察省阳高粮库管理不善
    渎职人员分别受处分
    抢护中有功者受到奖励
    【本报讯】察哈尔省阳高县对粮库管理不善，损坏粮食十一万余斤。粮库主任调动时不认真交接，新任主任不知粮库何在；对省府指示注意检查修补，亦未认真执行。今夏阴雨期间，七十三间库房中有五十四间漏水，内有五间塌顶。米包六十个，雨淋五日，腐烂发毒，无人过问。房东温万福之母冒雨去粮库报告，粮库干部置之不理，二次又经温母提出：“公粮是养兵的，你们为什么不管？”的严重批评后，仍未十分注意，只派人潦草检查一下，买席搭盖。直至库房东塌西倒时，才动员干部及群众，连夜倒仓抢救，但已坏粮十一万余斤。
    对此，察省人民政府特作如下处理：阳高县县长史保珍，对粮食工作漠不关心，遭此严重损失，理应撤职，惟念抢救认真，故从轻记大过一次。财政科长郑文焕，副科长李济堂忽视粮食保管，不注意库房修理，又不经常检查，致遭损失，郑文焕着予撤职，李济堂记过一次。粮库主任李元奎，前任主任兰承浩（现仍在库工作），刘应沛（已他调）既忽视保管检查，又不理温母报告，李元奎着予撤职，兰承浩记大过一次，刘应沛记过处分。当时省府干部张竞在该县负责供应任务，而对该县粮库不进行检查，虽在抢救中出力不小，仍应给予批评处分。雁北专署对此事亦应认真进行检讨。
    该县七区区长王桂兰，九区财粮助理于茂，连夜率领群众抢救有功，通报全县表扬。温万福之母发现库房漏水，两次冒雨报告，表现了对国家财产之高度关心，除通报全县表扬外，另予以物质奖励。华北人民政府除批准以上处理办法外，并令察省府应速规定公粮管理办法实施，并切实加强检查，以免再有损坏粮食事情发生。

    【又讯】丰台西仓库于本年四月十九日失火，损失夏衣等，按当时市价约值人民券一千万元左右。原因也是该库主任李世荣与西仓库总负责人张靖，管理不善，检查不严，无周密计划，防火准备不够，发现民工吸烟，又不加禁止，致发生火灾，使国家财产蒙受重大损失。财政部对该库管理情形，未作深入了解，未予防火防盗各种具体的指示，华北人民政府已令该部进行检讨，并教育所属，提高警惕，加强工作责任心。并对张靖予以警告处分，至李世荣，因属华北军区后勤部领导，另由该部予以适当处理。
