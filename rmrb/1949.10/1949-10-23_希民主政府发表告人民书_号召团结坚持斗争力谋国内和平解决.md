Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 22nd -- TASS, Sofia, October 20th: The Greek Elas News Agency recently published a proclamation from the Greek Provisional Democratic Government to the Greek people stating: "It has been three and a half years since the American and British imperialists and their royalist-fascist lackeys defiled our motherland, plunging it into blood and ruins. During this period, hundreds of thousands of people have shed their blood, losing their lives or becoming permanently disabled.

For three and a half years, the Greek Democratic Army has been fighting, defending the honor of Greece, the independence of the country, and the freedom and interests of the people.

For three and a half years, we have been demanding loyal agreements and a just and democratic peace. The royalist-fascist lackeys and their foreign masters have tried to bring complete disaster. We have understood that these enemies of Greece and the people would rather see the last resident of the country die, rather see the last house destroyed, the last tree uprooted, than grant the people their rights. They have spent millions of dollars, driving our children into the slaughterhouse, and throwing hundreds of thousands of tons of hot iron upon our heads, upon our children, mothers, and brothers. And today, they boast that they are the victors, because, with the help of the traitor Tito's betrayal, after deciding to destroy all progressive things within Greece, the Democratic Army preferred to stop the bloodshed. But if they imagine that the Democratic Army no longer exists, they are wrong. The Democratic Army has not laid down its arms, but is only waiting in readiness. It retreated in the face of the enormous material superiority of the foreign occupying forces, which was enhanced by the treachery and betrayal of Tito, who harmed the Democratic Army from behind. However, the Greek Democratic Army has not been subdued, has not been defeated. It remains strong, its strength is intact. It stopped the bloodshed in order to save the Greek people from complete annihilation, because it puts the interests of the country and the people first.

The Democratic Army Remains Strong and Intact
Never Ceasing Efforts for Freedom and Peace

Currently, at the initiative of the Soviet Union, relentless efforts are being made in the United Nations General Assembly to seek a peaceful resolution to the Greek problem. The rulers in Athens are talking glibly about domestic reconciliation, elections, and amnesty. For years, we have been working for domestic reconciliation with humanitarian aims. The fact that our troops in Grammos and Vitsi have stopped fighting to promote reconciliation in Greece also proves this point. This means a deep loyalty to the interests of the country; we are unwilling to see the country completely destroyed.

We will be vigilant and never stop our struggle for the interests of the people, for their political and economic rights."

The proclamation continued: "In view of the current misfortune and the future plots of the royalist-fascists, the task facing the Greek people is to unite and fight for their survival, for freedom and peace.

If the Greek people unite, they will be able to uphold their will. They are not alone. All of democratic humanity is with us. Through years of struggle that has won the praise of the whole world, our people have gained the sympathy of all nations. The world democratic and peace front is stronger and more consolidated today than ever before. It is invincible. The Soviet Union stands at the forefront of this front, and the power of the Soviet Union, its loyalty to the peace and freedom of all nations and the struggle it wages for them, are recognized by both friends and enemies."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 22nd -- TASS, New York: The Political Committee of the UN General Assembly continued its discussion on the 18th of the repugnant topic of "the political independence and territorial integrity of Greece being threatened." The Political Committee's deliberation of the "Greek issue" has clearly turned out to be unfavorable to the true initiators of the discussion - the United States and Britain. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Poland, and other countries have exposed the true motives of the United States, which is to shift the responsibility for the current situation in Greece onto Albania and Bulgaria. The United States, with the support of Britain, Australia, and certain other countries, hastily submitted this issue to the so-called "conciliation committee" to "resolve" the "disputes" between Greece and Albania and Bulgaria. The so-called "conciliation committee" was established on September 28th through a proposal by the Australian representative passed in the Political Committee, and it consisted of the President of the General Assembly, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Political Committee. At the meeting of the Political Committee on October 18th, a letter from the President of the General Assembly, the Philippine representative Romulo, was read, stating that the work of the "conciliation committee" had ended without result and the committee had been forced to suspend its existence. The Chairman of the Political Committee, the Canadian representative Pearson, stated that because the report of the "conciliation committee" had not yet been prepared, the Political Committee could not continue to consider the Greek issue. According to the proposal of the French representative, the committee decided to postpone further consideration of the Greek issue until it received the report of the "conciliation committee."

　　希民主政府发表告人民书
  　号召团结坚持斗争力谋国内和平解决
    【新华社北京二十二日电】塔斯社索非亚二十日讯：希腊艾拉斯通讯社顷发表希腊临时民主政府告希腊人民书称：“自从美英帝国主义者和他们的保皇法西斯奴仆玷辱我们祖国，使其陷入血泊和沦为废墟以来，迄今已有三年半了，在这一时期中，数十万人民流了他们的鲜血，以致丧失生命或终身残废。
    三年半以来，希腊民主军一直在战斗，维护着希腊的荣誉、国家的独立和人民的自由与利益。
    三年半以来，我们一直要求忠诚的协定和公正的民主的和平。保皇法西斯奴仆及其外国主子们力图带来全部的灾祸。我们已经明白：希腊和人民的这些敌人，宁愿看到国内最后一个居民死于非命，宁愿看到最后一栋房屋被摧毁、最后一颗树木被拔掉，并不愿意给人民以权利。他们耗费了数以百万计的美元，把我们的儿女驱入屠场，并将数以十万吨计的热铁，投到我们的头上，投到我们儿女、母亲和弟兄的头上。而今天，他们夸口说他们是胜利者，因为在他们借助于叛徒铁托的出卖，决定摧毁希腊境内各种进步的事物后，民主军宁愿停止流血。但是，如果他们设想民主军不复存在的话，那他们就错了。民主军并未曾放下武器，而只是枕戈以待。它是在外国占领军的巨大的物质优势面前撤退的，而外国占领军的巨大的物质优势，由于那在背后加害民主军的铁托之叛变与出卖而增强了。然而，希腊民主军并未被压服，并未被击败。它依然强大，它的实力是完整的。它停止流血，系为了拯救希腊人民免于完全被毁灭，因为它把国家与人民的利益摆在第一位。
    民主军依然强大完整
  　决不停止为自由和平努力
    目前，根据苏联的倡议，正在联合国大会进行坚持不懈的努力，以谋求希腊问题的和平解决。雅典统治者侈谈什么国内和解、选举和大赦。数年来，我们抱着人道的目的，努力谋求国内的和解。格拉姆斯与维齐的我军，业已停止战争，以促成希腊的和解，这一事实也证明了这一点。这意味着对国家利益的深挚的忠诚，我们不愿看到国家全部归于毁灭。
    我们将警惕，一刻也不停止我们为人民的利益、为他们的政治与经济权利而进行的斗争。”
    该书继称：“鉴于当前的不幸与保皇法西斯今后的图谋，希腊人民面临着的任务，就是团结一致为他们的生存、为自由与和平斗争。
    希腊人民团结起来就将能够维护他们的意志。他们不是孤独的。全体民主人类都和我们在一道。由于许多年来的已引起全世界之赞扬的斗争，我国人民获得了一切民族的同情。世界民主与和平阵线今天比以往更强大与巩固了。它是不可战胜的。苏联就屹立在这一阵线的前头，而苏联的威力、对各民族人民的和平与自由的忠诚以及为他们所进行的斗争，不论朋友与敌人都是承认的。”
    【新华社北京二十二日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：联大政治委员会于十八日继续讨论所谓“关于威胁希腊的政治独立和领土完整”这一令人憎恶的题目。政治委员会对“希腊问题”的审议，已显然反而不利于倡议讨论这一问题的真正发起人——美国和英国。苏、波等国的代表团，曾揭露了美国的真正动机，美国是打算把希腊现时局势的责任转嫁到阿尔巴尼亚和保加利亚身上的。美国在英国、澳大利亚和某些别的国家的支持下，就仓皇地将这一问题提交所谓“调解委员会”，以“解决”希腊和阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚之间的“分歧”。所谓“调解委员会”是在九月二十八日经由澳代表提议在政治委员会通过成立的，它由大会主席、联合国秘书长，政治委员会正副主席组成之。在十月十八日政治委员会的会议上，宣读了联大主席菲律宾代表罗莫洛的信件，内称：“调解委员会”的工作，已无结果而结束，委员会已被迫中止其存在。政治委员会主加席拿大代表皮尔逊称：由于“调解委员会”的报告尚未准备好，政治委员会无法继续考虑希腊问题。按照法国代表的提议，委员会决定在收到“调解委员会”的报告以前，暂缓进一步考虑希腊问题。
