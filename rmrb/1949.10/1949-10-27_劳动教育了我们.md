　　Labor Educated Us
　　Ji Dong Jian Guo Xue Yuan  Correspondence Group
　　On September 12th, the Jian Guo Xue Yuan began its second term of study in Tangshan. The first lesson was learning that labor creates the world and creates man. The labor viewpoint of "labor creates the world" began to be accepted by the students.  Therefore, discussions of "labor is glorious" and "theory must be combined with practice" fermented among the students. Students dug drainage ditches, carried dirty soil, fetched water, and washed dishes, setting off a wave of labor. Further, everyone requested to go to the countryside to help with the autumn harvest. Each class and group issued challenges to go to the countryside, and requested approval from the academy to go to the countryside to learn from labor.
　　On the morning of the 30th, all 565 students of the academy, divided into six teams, marched towards six villages in the suburbs, including Tanzhuang, Taipingzhuang, and Yuegezhuang. Most of the female students changed into short clothes, and the male students took off their leather shoes, cheerfully walking and singing: "Don't be lazy, don't damage furniture, don't accept compensation from the villagers..."
　　The songs of "The People's Liberation Army and the people... we are all one family..." spread into the villages. Men, women, old, and young all gathered around, whispering: "Can they also work?"
　　Village cadres arranged for the students to begin according to pre-arranged plans. Thus, digging up sorghum stalks, watering gardens, building pigsties, cleaning outhouses, making manure, making adobe bricks... immediately began. Student Wang Chunsheng said: "What do sorghum stalks look like? What do corn stalks look like? How can I tell the difference!" Li Xingfu pointed to a pile of manure in the field and said: "Whose grave is so neatly arranged..." ... All kinds of strange questions came up. Everyone carefully explored and humbly learned from each other. In the tense and joyful labor, no one felt tired, and no one felt their hands hurt. At noon, Bai Yuanyu cut his foot, and others persuaded him to put medicine on it, but he said: "Do farmers bring medicine when they go to the fields?"  He refused no matter what. Song Yuming's shoulders were swollen from carrying stalks, and he kept shouting: "I challenge you!" Niu Minjie untied his belt to tie the stalks to help transport them. The farmers' work became something the students cared deeply about. Everyone also constantly checked their own work to see if there were any careless or negligent areas.
　　Old men sent cigarettes, pears, peanuts... but were all politely declined by the students. Old women affectionately called them "these children," and secretly put corn flowers into the students' pockets of clothes they had taken off. On the third, the farmers of Da'aizhuang and Taipingzhuang took the opportunity to celebrate the success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the establishment of the Central People's Government to have a joint celebration with the students of the first team. The students welcomed them with warm applause. Zhang Shenyuan said with emotion: "We did this little bit of work for the farmers, and they are so enthusiastic towards us. If we serve the people for life in the future, one can imagine how much the working people will love us!"
　　From theoretical study on campus to combining with practice in the countryside, the vast majority of students have begun to experience the emotions of the working people.  Due to their own sore hands and feet, they have a preliminary understanding of the farmers' spring planting, autumn harvest, summer weeding, and the work of one grain of rice and one drop of sweat. Students in Class Five said: "In the past, we disliked coarse grains as not tasty and 'not nutritious' and demanded improved living standards. Now we shouldn't be picky anymore, right!" Some students in Class Three said: "This time we know that eating is not easy!" Some students used to think that the hands of those who carried heavy loads were rough, black, and unsanitary, but now looking at their own hands that had changed after just one day of labor, no one said anything more.
　　On October 9th, the students continued to go to the countryside. The farmers welcomed them from afar, asking them what they wanted to eat and drink, and asking them to go to their homes.  Encouraged by the farmers' enthusiasm, everyone picked cotton, pulled beans, shelled corn... Female student Li Yuwen said: "I won't be tired even if I work for two weeks!" Huang Ruiyi, who had been weeding before, said: "I want to dig stalks, I want to use a big hoe!" Even with blisters on his hands, he didn't rest. He reflected that he was born in a landlord's family, collected rent, acted as a bloodsucker, despised labor, and was detached from labor, and was fed for twenty-three years by farmers who labored in the fields year after year in the wind and rain. He felt base and shameful...
　　The farmers looked at us expectantly and said: "Look at these students, they are so good, they can read and they can also work!" An old woman said: "It's really a change of world. The other day, the trading company came to build a wall for me, and today you came to dig stalks for me. It's all thanks to Chairman Mao's good deeds..."
　　Three days of labor have passed, and everyone solicited the farmers' opinions on the students. They just smiled and said: "Everything is good, it's just not good that you don't eat our food."
　　Although it was only five days of labor, the harvest of five days was really not small.  First of all, the students' old intellectual airs began to be put down under the sincere, simple, and enthusiastic emotions of the working people!  In addition to digging up 829.7 mu of stalks, watering 2093 ridges of gardens, shelling 182.7 shi of corn, and making 2684 adobe bricks..., they also knew the question of "who feeds whom," began to realize the truth of "labor creates the world," and deeply experienced that the emotional change from the old intellectual to the worker-peasant, and the shift of position from the old intellectual to the worker-peasant, still requires continued experience and continued training in future long-term study.

　　劳动教育了我们
    冀东建国学院  通讯组
    九月十二日建国学院开始了在唐山的第二期学习，第一课是劳动创造世界，创造人的学习，“劳动创造世界”的劳动观点开始为同学们接受了。于是“劳动是光荣的”，“理论要与实际结合”的研讨在同学中酝酿起来，同学们挖阴沟、抬脏土、挑水、洗饭碗，掀起了劳动的热潮。进一步大家又要求下乡帮助秋收，各班各组纷纷发出下乡挑战书，而且向院部请求批准下乡从劳动中学习。
    三十日早晨，全院五六五位同学分成六队向市郊檀庄、太平庄、岳各庄等六个村行进了，大部分女同学换上了短装，男同学脱下了皮鞋，兴高彩烈的一边走一边唱：“不偷懒，不损坏家具，不接老乡报酬……”
    “解放军老百姓……咱们是一家人……”的歌声传进了村里，男的、女的、老的、小的都围了上来；低声的议论着：“他们也会干活？”
    村干部们按着预先商洽的计划把同学们都布置开，于是刨楂子、浇园子、起猪圈、掏毛房、捣粪、脱坯……马上展开了劳动，王春生同学说：“高粱楂子啥样？棒子楂子啥样？我咋分不清！”李星福指着地里的粪堆说：“谁家的坟这整齐……”……千奇百怪的问题都出来了，大家小心翼翼的摸索着，彼此虚心的学习着。在紧张愉快的劳动里，谁也感不到累，谁也感不到手痛，中午白元玉脚上拉了口子，别人劝他上药去，他说：“庄稼人下地，还带着药？”无论如何也不肯，宋玉明挑楂子肩膀压肿了，嘴里还不住喊着：“我向你们挑战！”牛敏思解下腰带捆楂子帮助输送，农民的活计，变成了同学们心坎上的事，大家还不时的复查着自己的工作，看有没有疏忽草率的地方。
    老大爷们送来了烟、梨、花生…但都被同学们婉言谢绝了，老大娘们亲切的叫着“这群孩子”，要给同学们洗衣服，有的就把棒子花偷偷装到同学们脱下的衣服口袋里。三号大艾庄太平庄的农民趁庆祝中国人民政协成功，中央人民政府成立的机会，到一部和同学联欢，同学们以热烈的掌声欢迎着他们。张慎远感动的说：“我们给农民干了这点活，就对我们这样热情，今后要终身给人民服务，那劳动人民将怎样的热爱我们，就可想而知了！”
    从校内的理论学习到下乡的结合实际，绝大多数同学已开始体会到劳动人民的情感，由于自身的手痛脚痛对农民春种秋收夏天锄草，一粒米一滴汗的工作有了初步的了解，五班同学说：“咱们过去嫌粗粮不好吃，‘营养不足’要求改善生活，现在该不再挑剔了吧！”三班有的同学说：“这回可知道吃饭不容易啦！”有的同学过去看扛活的手又粗又黑不卫生，现在看着自己刚刚劳动一天就变了样的手，谁也不再说啥了。
    十月九日，同学们又继续下乡了，农民们老远就迎来问吃问喝，要求到他们家里去，大家在农民们的热情鼓舞下，摘棉花、拔豆子、搓棒子……，女同学李郁文说：“干两星期也不累！”先在拔草的黄瑞逸同学说：“我要刨楂子，我要用大镐！”手上打着泡，也不歇，他反省自己生在地主家里，催租子，当吸血鬼，轻视劳动脱离劳动，白白的让长年累月栉风淋雨劳动在地里的农民给养活了二十三年，他感到卑鄙可耻……。
    农民们眼巴巴的望着我们说：“看人家这学生多好，会读书，还会干活！”有位老大娘说：“真是换天下了，前天贸易公司来给我垒墙，今天你们又来给我刨楂子，这都是毛主席兴的好事……。”
    三天的劳动又过去了，大家征求农民对同学们的意见，他们直笑着说：“啥都好，就是不吃我们的不好。”
    虽然仅只是五天的劳动，可是，五天的收获也着实不小，同学们的旧知识分子的架子，首先在劳动人民诚挚、纯朴、热情的感动下，开始放下啦！除了刨楂子八二九·七亩，浇园子二○九三畦，搓棒子一八二·七石，脱坯二六八四块……外；他们还知道了“谁养活谁”的问题，开始认识了“劳动创造世界”的真理，并且深深的体验到，从旧有的知识分子感情变化到工农的感情，从旧有的知识分子的立场转变到工农的立场，是还需要在今后长期的学习中，继续体验，继续锻炼的。
