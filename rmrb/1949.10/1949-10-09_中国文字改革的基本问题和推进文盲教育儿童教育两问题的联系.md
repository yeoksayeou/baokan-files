The reform of Chinese characters is necessary. Anyone who is concerned about the current needs of the broad masses of workers and peasants for culture, and the difficulty of learning Chinese characters and the time it takes, will demand reform. However, reforming Chinese characters is an arduous task. If there is no precise plan beforehand, it will be difficult to promote.

		Principles of Character Reform

The main purpose of reforming Chinese characters is to make them easy to learn, that is, to be easy to recognize, understand, remember, express, and write. As for the convenience of printing, typing, telegraphing, and good looks, these are secondary in comparison.

On the other hand, character reform must take into account China's specific environment. What kind of reform can be accepted by the largest number of people—from children to adults, from illiterates to intellectuals? How can it be reformed smoothly, and what are the major drawbacks after the reform? How can the reform plan continue to develop without stagnating at a certain stage after a slight reform?

Therefore, to reform Chinese characters, we must first understand the history of Chinese characters, the relationship between Chinese language and characters, accept all past experience, and use new perspectives and new methods to study this issue in light of the current situation. Here, there is no need to create an overly ideal plan or blindly adhere to any dogma, but to connect with reality.

		The Nature of the New Script – A Comprehensive Script

From a technical point of view, the first thing to do is to determine the nature of the new script. Is it a phonetic script? Is it a symbolic script? Or is it a comprehensive script that combines the two? Chinese characters were originally a comprehensive script, mixed with a small part of symbolic characters and a large part of phonetic-semantic characters. Due to long-term evolution, many phonetic-semantic characters have become like symbolic characters, so modern Chinese characters almost completely rely on memory.

If we only consider the ease of recognition or memory, of course, it is best to simply and directly change to a phonetic script. However, to reform a script that has a history of thousands of years and has been used in such a vast area is not a simple matter and does not allow for such a hasty approach. We must first consider the essence of the Chinese language, with so many homophones. Can it be easily understood and expressed if a purely phonetic script is used immediately? We also have to consider that past historical culture is entirely built on old Chinese characters, and the impression of old Chinese characters on people, regardless of their level of education, cannot be changed in a short time. Therefore, a sudden change and complete abandonment of Chinese characters will inevitably cause chaos, at least it will not work at present.

However, a person's memory power is limited, and learning time is limited. It takes too much time to learn old Chinese characters, which of course hinders other work. Although it is impossible to completely abandon Chinese characters, we can always limit it and select hundreds, at most a thousand, of the most commonly used and simplest characters as basic characters that everyone must learn. Assuming that you learn two or three characters a day, you can learn them in at most one year, which is much easier than learning four or five thousand Chinese characters, which takes four or five, six or seven years.

Of course, these few Chinese characters are not enough. In the past, some people proposed basic Chinese characters, mechanically limiting the use of only a thousand or so characters, so that "daughter-in-law" was written as "son's wife," which could not express all languages. The only way is to accept the original structure of Chinese characters. In addition to these few symbolic characters, we can completely use new phonetic characters to replace them. In this way, we return to the form of a comprehensive script, which can express any language.

This new form reduces the number of old Chinese characters to the minimum, greatly reducing the difficulty of learning and memorizing. However, since these Chinese characters are the most common and widely used, they usually account for 60% or even 100% of books or documents. In addition, phonetic characters are used to supplement them, which is easy to understand and can express everything. Therefore, there will be no abruptness during the reform, and the reform work can be carried out smoothly.

Although this new form is still a comprehensive script, it is completely different from the old form. Since most of the old Chinese characters have been liberated and changed to phonetic symbols, and the new phonetic script can write out languages that the old Chinese characters could not represent, the new development will be unlimited as it evolves.

		The Form of New Phonetic Letters – National Form

If the phonetic symbols of the changed Chinese characters still use the old phonetic-semantic character method, or do not use radicals and only write wrong characters, it is just a change of soup but not the medicine. Due to the different eras and regions, characters that are considered homophones at this time and place are completely different at different times and places, so they are often inaccurate. Moreover, too many phonetic symbols are required, which is still inconvenient to memorize and learn.

Under the principle of ease of learning, we advocate using letters to spell. However, the letter forms of various new script schemes are very complicated, mainly divided into four categories:

(1) Letters using the Chinese character system,
(2) Using Latin letters,
(3) Letters representing phonetics using shorthand,
(4) Letters using meaning symbols. Except for the fourth category, the phonetic effects are the same.

At present, most intellectuals still advocate using Latin letters, which is unnecessary. After Zhao Yuanren and others created the overly complicated Mandarin Romanization, which the public could not accept, in 1923, Comrade Qu Qiubai of the Chinese Communist Party formulated the simple and easy-to-learn Latinized New Script in 1930, which was completely necessary and progressive at that time. He resolutely abandoned tones, which is worth writing about in the history of character reform. In revolutionary work, this new script movement also played a huge role.

But now that the whole of China is about to be completely liberated, economic construction and cultural revival are all important tasks at present, it is not very appropriate to suddenly change to a new script that is far from the habits of the people. In the masses, the national form is easier to accept, so we can only adopt the national form to break some of the habits. At present, stubbornly adhering to foreign old forms, only using Latin letters, and not creating new forms suitable for this environment and this nation is not a realistic approach.

Due to the semi-colonial nature of China, and because missionaries in the Ming Dynasty used Roman letters for spelling, scholars have developed the idea that Latin letters are the most convenient, and that "since Roman letters have completed an unprecedented work in the West, it must also complete the same work in the East." (See Ni Haishu's "Outline of Chinese Phonetic Writing"). The biggest reason for many people who praise Latin letters is only internationalization. In fact, even if Chinese new characters use Latin letters, what they represent is still Chinese pronunciation. Then, the so-called internationalization is only the form of twenty-odd letters. However, in the advanced Soviet Union, only Russian letters are used instead of Latin forms. We can use either set of letters to spell, so why must we use the form of Latin letters?

The main purpose of reforming characters at present is for practical use. Chinese characters cannot be abandoned all at once. If you only learn a set of Latinized new characters, you still won't know Chinese characters, and you still won't have a large number of books and newspapers to read, which is useless. If you want to use a comprehensive script and still retain a small part of Chinese characters, then all the majority of the new characters can only be matched with letters of the Chinese character system. Suppose the Latinized new script uses ZH two letters to represent the initial consonant of "zhi," we only use the character "之" to represent it; Latinization uses BA to represent the character "巴," but we write it as "北Y"; what's the difference? From the perspective of people who have learned foreign languages, it is of course easier to think that ABCD is more common, but it is the same for beginners. Because from the phoneme represented by the letter, Chinese character letters and Latin letters are exactly the same.

Some people think that Latinized new characters use the Chinese language, which is a national form, which is completely wrong. Using Chinese beef to make American-style rare, bloody steak, isn't it foreign food? Can it make the Chinese people love to eat it?

Looking at it roughly, the difference between using Latin letters in a foreign form and using Chinese character system letters in a national form is only in form, but as it develops, the entire system will be different. Using Latin letters is in opposition to Chinese characters. If Chinese characters are not eliminated, it will be difficult for the new script to develop, and there will be no talk of replacing Chinese characters. If you use Chinese character system letters, you can combine with a part of the old Chinese characters. This new script will completely replace the old Chinese characters, and all contradictions will be completely unified.

		New Script Spelling - Two-Part Sounds

In principle, the spelling of a word should be as simple as possible. Many of the phonemes in the Chinese language are difficult to analyze. For example, "之," "尺," "尸," "日," phoneticians can certainly separate a vowel from them, which is what the National Romanization does, but this is a matter for phoneticians, and the general public does not need it at all.

In this regard, because the phonetic alphabet uses letters from the Chinese character system, it is simpler than the Latinized new script and the National Romanization; Wang Zhao's Official Combined Sound Letters and Lao Naixuan's Simplified Characters are even simpler than the phonetic alphabet because they use the counter-cut form that has been used for thousands of years. The phonetic alphabet is influenced by phonologists and wants to distinguish between four levels, so there are medial letters, so some characters have to be spelled with three letters. This method of three-part sounds is not customary for the public and is not easy to learn. Wang and Lao include the medial letters "乙," "五," "于" in the initials, so there are more letters, but the spelling of each character has only two letters. This simplest spelling in the world, such as the two characters "不用," can be read as "甭," which everyone will know, which is most in line with the characteristics of the Chinese language.

The old-style Chinese counter-cut is very difficult to learn. The current two-part sound has the same form, but is completely different in essence. This is simple, easy to learn, and very accurate. This is the crystallization of Chinese phonology for two thousand years combined with modern science. With Latin letters or the International Phonetic Alphabet as a comparison, this spelling is simple, and there is no fear of confusion.

		Handling of Tones

Chinese characters originally did not indicate tones, only indicating them when particularly needed, or using circles to indicate them. Wang Zhao, Lao Naixuan, and the phonetic alphabet indicated tone symbols. Because the National Romanization uses a foreign form and cannot install domestic tone symbols, it has to play tricks in spelling. Some of the letters that make up a character are the sound of the character, and some are the tone. A letter is sometimes the sound of the character and sometimes the tone. For example, the three characters "使用法" are written as SHYYYONQFAA, there are three Y here, both ends are the sound of the character (it's two characters), and the middle is the tone. How difficult is this confusing and clumsy way of writing to learn!

The Latinized New Script abandons tones (there are only distinctions in a few special examples), which is a brilliant and decisive method in terms of learning and writing. Of course, it has its own shortcomings, but it is because of its simplicity that it can be effective in terms of popularization.

There is a distance between language and writing. The spirit and attitude when speaking, as well as the high, low, light, heavy, fast, and slow of the voice, cannot be written in writing. Although the tones of language are universally present, they are different in different places. It is impossible to strictly stipulate the tones in writing and ask people to learn them. Since Wang Zhao, all the way to the National Romanization, they have all gone down this wrong path, asking people to learn the tones of Beijing dialect, so it has become unifying the national language instead of reforming characters.

Chinese characters do not indicate tones. The same character "上," the "上" in "上楼" (upstairs) is an rising tone, and the "上" in "楼上" (upstairs) is a falling tone. There is a natural distinction when you read it out. Since Wang Zhao, because they want to leave the form of Chinese characters and rely entirely on spelling, they have to indicate tones to avoid the difficult problem of too many homophones, and thus they have embarked on a wrong path.

The comprehensive script retains a part of Chinese characters, so it can take the advantages of Chinese characters and the Latinized new script. For the new characters that are added, there is only spelling, regardless of tones. Because Chinese characters are still the backbone, there is no fear of confusion of homophones. This form of the new script will be the simplest. However, when necessary, it can still specially mark some symbols.

		Two Forms of New Script – Basic Form and Complete Form

The initial Latinized New Script had shortcomings. Because there are too many homophones in the Chinese language, there are time and environmental restrictions when talking. Everyone can understand the topic being said, and the spirit and attitude of the speaker can also help to understand, so except for a few special nouns or specialized knowledge, there will not be much difficulty. When it is written on paper, for a stranger reader, thousands of miles away, after ten or a hundred years, if only some phonetic symbols are spelled out, and these phonetic symbols sometimes represent dozens of homophones, then it must be inexplicable. Of course, some places can be guessed, but the reader's time is precious. Asking him to guess east and think west is not as good as reading another text that is clear at a glance.

Therefore, the Latinized New Script has only achieved significant results in popularization. Once it comes to improving culture, it encounters many practical difficulties. Some new script workers want to remedy this shortcoming, expand the examples of character differentiation, advocate shaping, and advocate variant characters. This destroys the initial simple advantages and becomes complicated again. The National Romanization is completely based on phonetics. Although it is complicated, there are still rules to follow. When it comes to the New Latinization, it is just artificial differentiation of homophones. The increase or change of letters has no rules and no meaning, which is equivalent to new symbols, which all depend on scholars to memorize.

Comrade Xu Teli said:

The difficulty in promoting the new script is that intellectuals have Chinese characters as a tool and also know foreign languages. Therefore, those who support the new script try to shape it in order to replace Chinese characters, adding some symbols to the new script, increasing the difficulty of learning for illiterates. Another part of the intellectuals use their own knowledge to find the shortcomings of the new script to oppose the new script because the new script itself has many shortcomings. They do not pay attention to the poor people who have dropped out of school. Only unsophisticated writing is easy to learn and easy to popularize. - Zhang Yan, "An Outline of the Chinese New Script"

This paragraph is completely correct from the perspective of popularization. However, in the current Chinese environment, we cannot only popularize without considering improvement. It is undeniable that the initial new script has shortcomings. Even if the New Latinization adds symbols and increases the difficulty of learning for illiterates, it still cannot completely replace Chinese characters.

In fact, since the old Chinese characters are not easy to abolish, we can find ways to learn less, use the most economical time to learn a part of the simplest Chinese characters, and when Chinese characters are not enough, add a set of simple phonetic script, which will become the comprehensive script mentioned earlier. This phonetic script does not necessarily have to replace Chinese characters. Just make the form of the new script consistent with Chinese characters and change the Latin letters to Chinese character system letters. This comprehensive script is somewhat like Japanese script, with Chinese characters and kana mixed together. In recent years, the Japanese have gradually restricted and reduced Chinese characters. We can learn from this experience by retaining a part of Chinese characters and developing phonetic script on the other hand.

This comprehensive script is very convenient for people who are just learning to read. Learn hundreds of Chinese characters, and then learn a set of phonetics, and you can read all the books and newspapers written and printed in comprehensive script. When you want to use writing to express yourself, write Chinese characters if you have them, and write phonetics if you can't write them. In short, only learning a part of Chinese characters takes more time. Otherwise, it is as simple and easy to learn as the initial Latinization.

This is the basic form of this new script. Although there is a part of Chinese characters as the backbone, it is easier to understand, but the part that only uses phonetics still has the difficulty of homophones. Sometimes, it is still not clear at a glance, but it is better than the initial Latinization, which completely relies on phonetics. In terms of popularization, this is already a good tool. If you want to improve culture, of course it is not enough.

In order to cooperate with advanced culture, this basic form can be changed to a complete form at any time. The differentiation of homophones in old Chinese characters originally relied on the distinction of shape symbols (that is, meaning symbols). "桐" (tung tree) is tung tree, "铜" (copper) is metal, "筒" (tube) is bamboo tube. You can understand the meaning of the character when you see the radical. This is something that the variant characters of the New Latinization cannot do by arbitrarily changing letters. Our complete form can accept this old form and accept most of the old shape symbols (of course, some unreasonable shape symbols can be replaced), but the phonetic symbol part uses a new spelling method. This complete form almost differentiates all homophones and can almost completely replace old Chinese characters. All high-level cultural academics can be published in this script, and all works and documents written in old Chinese characters can be translated into this script. All the shortcomings of the Latinized New Script are almost completely eliminated here. But its spelling is still so simple and easy to learn, without any need to change. Popularization and improvement are completely unified here. (For a detailed plan of this script, see my book "The Theory and Plan of Chinese Character Reform," sold by Kaiming Bookstore).

		The Issue of Character Matching Language – National Standard Writing and Dialect Writing

In the past, Chinese characters were influenced by the stagnation of culture in feudal society and the restraint of literati who favored classics. What they wrote were languages that had already died. Generally speaking, writing and language seemed to be separated. In fact, the separation of writing from language is only a partial phenomenon. A chicken is still a chicken, a fish is still a fish, and meat is still meat; the character "食" (shi) is no longer commonly used in language, and it is only said "吃" (chi), but what birds eat is still called "食"; the character "作" (zuo) is no longer commonly used, but the "作" in "mud work" (泥水作) and "wood work" (木作) is still common. Some characters, such as "厥" (jue) and "矣" (yi), have become rigid with the death of the language; some characters, such as "吧" (ba) and "吗" (ma), have also been produced by the evolution of the language. Therefore, some works in the past (such as quotations, poems, operas, novels, etc.) could not represent living language. The separation of language and writing is only the fault of writers, not the shortcomings of writing itself as a tool. However, language is constantly evolving, and writing often cannot keep up. Dialect literature has not developed, and many dialects have not created writing. Some dialects that originally had writing cannot think of how to write them in a hurry. These shortcomings are due to the fact that writing has become a symbol. As long as there is a phonetic script, this situation can be completely improved.

However, the matching of writing and language cannot be completely close. Language is easy to change and is easily restricted by region. The closer the writing is to the language, the narrower its popular area; conversely, the more the writing can unify divergent languages, the further it is from each dialect. Old Chinese characters have a great distance from modern dialects, but they can unify a vast area. A Fuzhou or Guangzhou person can hardly understand what a Beijing person is saying, but the words written are the same. Since the movement to reform Chinese characters has become popular, the issue of character matching language has been particularly raised. Which living language will the phonetic script choose as the standard? Or will it synthesize a standard from several dialects? Or will it formulate different dialect scripts according to the divergent languages?

The phonetic alphabet and the National Romanization adopted the first method. It has objective factual basis, that is, the language of two million people in Beijing. But it is too objective, and the matching is too close. If you want to pay attention to tones and intonation in all aspects and meet the standard, it is not only reforming characters but first artificially unifying language. This cannot be done and is going down the wrong path. The Latinized New Script advocates dividing the country into several regions, synthesizing hundreds of different dialects in each region, formulating plans, and using writing to promote the unification of language. In the future, the characters of each region will be merged into one character. (Some people also advocate having a unified national standard character first.) This is the second method. This script is not close to any dialect, so it is artificial and has no linguistic basis. When reading it, people in each small area will understand some and not understand some, so it is easy to cause controversy about the basis of the choice. Various dialects will naturally harmonize due to the close relationship between politics, economy, and transportation, but before all objective conditions are mature, subjectively creating a certain standard language is often biased or neither fish nor fowl. It is also impossible to get the masses to learn this script.

Chinese characters were originally unified. Although it is only the unification of writing without unifying language, the pronunciation of some characters (which is different from the phonetic sound) is often close. This closeness is inseparable from the relationship between politics, economy, and transportation. Therefore, since the Song and Yuan dynasties, the official language area, which is the political center, has been expanding day by day. This historical fact proves that the movement to unify the pronunciation of characters based on Beijing dialect is correct.

Now, this superior condition still exists: because the capital of the People's Republic of China is Beijing; because the phonetic components of Beijing dialect are simpler than other dialects and easier to learn; because of the results of the unified national language movement for decades; taking advantage of the situation, using Beijing dialect as the standard for the spelling of the new script is better than having no standard, and it is better than creating a standard.

But we should not require strict phonetic standards. Writing is ultimately just writing. It is enough to read it almost. Some people in the near suburbs of Beijing pronounce "安" (an) as "囡" (nan). You can write your AN and he can say his NAN. In this way, there will still be some distance between writing and language. Engels once talked about the suitability of English writing for pronunciation, quoting a Frenchman as saying: "You write London, but you read Constantinople"; we can see that the same word is pronounced differently by Londoners, Scots, and Americans; French, Germans, and Japanese pronounce it even more differently; Chinese people pronounce English, and people from Beijing and Guangdong will also pronounce it differently; so it is impossible to force everyone to learn a dialect to the point of being completely up to standard. For writing, only the spelling is stipulated, and the phoneme represented by each letter is stipulated. The reader may have some differences, because this does not hinder the unification of writing, that is, the unification of writing (spelling).

In the past, Chinese characters were unified. At present, we still have to require the unification of writing and emphasize this point. But on the other hand, we advocate that any dialect or the language of ethnic minorities can be freely developed and written into writing without artificial unification. There is no contradiction here, only technical issues. If Beijing dialect is adopted as the national standard writing, its letters will be the fewest. Some Mandarin-speaking areas can distinguish between sharp and blunt sounds, so they need to add some letters. The Wu language area needs to add more, and the Min or Cantonese language needs to add some more. In this way, a set of letters including dialects from all over the country can be formulated. In any area, they can use their own dialect letters to spell out writing.

Writing can be learned, but due to the significant differences in some regional dialects, it is very necessary to use dialect writing as a tool for popularization. In some literary works, describing the characteristics of the dialect will make the reader feel particularly close. But works written entirely in dialect are subject to regional restrictions. National laws, documents, and works can still only be written in the national standard writing.

In this way, the national standard writing and dialect writing can be developed at the same time, and the differences in language will not hinder the unification of writing. It is easy to learn the standard writing after learning dialect writing, and because the standard writing is a unified script, it will be used in every corner of the country, so it is easier to promote the unification of language.

The politics and economy of the New China will have a high degree of development, and the contact of transportation will be very close. Various dialects will quickly merge. As a cultural transportation writing tool, it must be very flexible to cooperate with this era. Develop new ones, and don't kick the old ones away; develop the common language that can be popular in the widest area, and don't forget the special languages of the few people in the smallest area; in this way, the relationship between language and writing can be truly closely linked.

		Linking Character Reform with Reality – Improving Literacy Education and Children's Education

Character reform must be feasible. Comrade Xu Teli said that the new script "can only be consolidated if it has a broad foundation among the illiterate," which is completely correct. However, at present, the purpose of reforming characters is not only limited to poor people who have dropped out of school. We must also pay attention to the problem of children's literacy, and also take care of the problem of transformation and learning of intellectuals who already have Chinese characters as a tool. This is a broader foundation, which can make this new script more consolidated.

Therefore, character reform must be for the sake of popularization, but at the same time, we must pay attention to improving from this popularization foundation, and not just let go after popularization is completed. Learning the new script still cannot read all books and newspapers, and cannot be widely used in any place, so that popularization is one thing and improvement is another, isolating the problem is a bias.

If this new script is a comprehensive script, it will take care of the needs of all aspects, reforming old Chinese characters on the one hand and creating new characters on the other, and the old and new can be integrated. It uses a completely national form, so it can be accepted by anyone, but it has undergone scientific transformation, so it is easy to learn and easy to popularize. It is the simplest, meets the needs of the masses, and is also the most perfect and comprehensive, and can undertake the development of the highest level of culture.

Such a new script will not be just empty talk, but can be immediately linked to education issues. There will be no need to spend years arguing about those academic-style trivial issues such as phonetic tones, etc., but can immediately go to practice, discover problems in practice, and study problems.

There are many educational problems, and literacy education and children's education are the most basic. The current Chinese characters are very difficult to learn. Advocating simplified characters does not solve this difficulty. Only selecting some commonly used Chinese characters and limiting the number of characters used, without being able to match the language, is not a thorough method. Leaving Chinese characters and using the new script of Latin letters is in opposition to Chinese characters. Learning the new script and having to learn Chinese characters is suspected of piling beds on top of each other and wasting energy; learning the new script and not learning Chinese characters also suffers from not having many books and newspapers to read, and it is of little use. Only by using comprehensive writing can this problem be solved, so that the writing learning time can be reduced to the lowest limit. If it can be promoted in a step-by-step manner, the character reform plan can be completely completed in at most ten years.

The first step in this work is to select basic characters. First, we need to investigate which characters are most needed by workers, peasants, and other people, then count which characters are most commonly seen in books, newspapers, and documents, and then decide from the educator's perspective which characters everyone must learn. Then, linguists will select which commonly used characters are the simplest and cannot be analyzed, and the original characters will be retained; some commonly used and very important characters, but the characters themselves are too complicated, can be simplified, or if they have been simplified, the simplified characters will be retained; these two types will be designated as basic characters that everyone must learn. There should not be too many of these characters, so as not to waste learning time, so the limit is at most no more than one thousand. In addition, even if the characters are simple to the point that they cannot be analyzed, but they are not commonly used in daily life, they can be put in the dictionary. There are also commonly used characters that are too complicated and cannot be simplified, so they are changed to phonetic writing. Of course, the letters of the phonetic writing and the writing method of the characters must be discussed in detail. The language represented by the standard characters, as well as the provisions for dialect letters, must also be carefully studied and discussed.

After these preparations, we can start editing textbooks and all readings. When editing textbooks with comprehensive writing, the first thing to pay attention to is to completely include all the basic characters from shallow to deep, and each basic character should use various usages as much as possible. On the other hand, for the education objects, for example: the knowledge needed by various parts such as primary school students, workers, and farmers, as well as politics, economics, science, history, etc., must be taken care of, and phonetic writing can be used as much as possible outside of the basic characters, so that they will not be restricted by the characters.

Of course, dictionaries must be prepared. In addition, various readings must be gradually published, and books that discuss specialized knowledge must be gradually improved. There is also a need for small newspapers, which will gradually develop into large newspapers and periodicals.

Before implementation, technical training must of course be given to educational staff at all levels. After implementation, it is also necessary to collect opinions and work experience from all parties, and improve this plan at any time and any place.

This plan can be experimented in the North China region. First, organize an institution to prepare this work. After the preparation is completed, start from primary schools and literacy supplementary schools. After the first phase of primary school is completed, it will be immediately promoted in middle schools. After the middle school education is completed, it can be fully promoted in the entire region, and then further promoted to the whole country. There must be an overall plan during implementation, that is, readings from the simplest to the most complex must be gradually prepared, so that there will be no books to read at a certain time, resulting in a cultural break. Then, in at most a dozen years, the old Chinese characters will definitely be overthrown, and the new comprehensive writing will definitely succeed. This writing will solve the difficulty of literacy, promote the new culture developed under the New Democracy, and will definitely cooperate with the development of language to nurture a more advanced new writing.

Character reform and education issues need to be linked together. The improvement of writing tools can solve some of the difficulties for educators and push the work forward, but character reform must be practiced through education. At present, character reformers should recognize the actual needs, not be too biased towards ideals, adhere to dogmas, and put forward some methods that cannot be implemented immediately. Educators should not face a serious problem and not try to solve it. Let us unite! Create a new script that must be feasible, must be practical, and must be successful! The younger generation is looking forward to us.

　　中国文字改革的基本问题和推进文盲教育儿童教育两问题的联系
    唐兰
    汉字是需要改革的，每个人，只要关心到目前广大的工农劳动群众对于文化的需要，和汉字的难学，太费时间，就会要求改革的。但是改革汉字是一件艰巨的工作，如其在事前，没有精密的计划，是很难推进的。
    　　　　文字改革的原则
    改革汉字的主要目的是容易学习，那就是要容易认识、了解、记忆、表达和书写。至于印刷、打字、打电报的方便，以及写出来好看等，比较起来，总还是次要的。
    另一方面，改革文字必须注意到中国具体环境。怎样的改革，能使最大多数的群众——包括幼童到成人，文盲到知识分子，都能接受；怎样能顺利地改革，改革后没有很大的流弊；怎样可以使改革的计划不断的发展，而不至于略为改革，就停滞在某一阶段上。
    因此，改革汉字，必须先了解汉字的历史，中国语言和文字的关系，接受过去一切经验，针对目前情况，用新的观点，新的方法，去研讨这个问题。这里不需要创造太理想的计划，或死守什么教条，而需要和实际联系起来。
    　　　　新文字的性质——综合文字
    从技术方面来说，第一得先决定新文字的性质。声符文字呢？符号文字呢？还是两者兼用的综合文字呢？汉字本来是综合文字，由一小部分的符号文字和大部分的形声文字混合起来的。由于长期的演化，许多形声字变得和符号文字一样，所以现代的汉字，几乎完全要靠记忆。
    如其单从容易认识或记忆等观点来说，当然最好是直截痛快地改为拼音文字。不过，要改革有几千年的历史而且在这样广大的地域里曾经通用过的文字，不是一件简单的事情，不容许这样操切的办法的。我们首先要考虑到中国语言的本质，同音字这样多，现在立刻改用纯粹的拼音文字，能不能容易了解和表达的问题。也还得考虑过去的历史文化，完全建筑在旧汉字上面，一般人无论文化程度的深浅，对于旧汉字的印象，一时不能改变。所以，突然的改变，完全废弃汉字，一定要引起一种混乱，至少在目前是行不通的。
    但是一个人记忆的力量是有限的，学习的时间是有限的，旧汉字在学习上太费时间，当然要妨碍其他的工作。完全废弃汉字虽不可能，但是我们总可以把它限制一下，把最常用的最简单的文字，选出几百个，最多到一千个，作为人人必须学习的基本文字。假定一天学两三个字，最多一年也可以学会，比原来要学四五千汉字，费上四五年，六七年，就容易多了。
    这些少数汉字，当然是不够用的。过去有人提创过基本汉字，机械地限定了只用一千多字，以致把“媳妇”写成“儿子的老婆”，这是不能表达一切语言的。惟一的办法，是接受汉字本来的组织，除了这些少数的符号字外，我们完全可以用新的声符字来代替，这样，就又回复到综合文字的形式，可以表达出任何的语言了。
    这样的新形式，把旧汉字减到最少的数量，大大地减少了学习和记忆的困难。但由于这些汉字都是最常见，最通用的，在书籍或文件中普通占百分之六十，甚至百分之百，此外，就用声符文字来补充，这是很容易了解的，也是能够表达一切的。所以，改革时，不会觉得突兀，改革的工作，将可以顺利地进行。
    这样的新形式，虽则还是综合文字，但和旧形式已完全不同。旧汉字既然大部分得到解放，改为声符，新的声符文字又可以把旧汉字所不能代表的语言都写了出来，这样演化下去，新的发展，将是不可限量的。
    　　　　新声符字母的形式——民族形式
    改易汉字的声符，如其仍旧用旧形声字的方法，或者不要偏旁，只写别字，总是换汤不换药。由于时代的不同，地域的不同，此时此地认为是同音的字，异时异地，就完全不同，所以往往是不确切的。并且需要声符太多，仍旧是不便记忆与学习的。
    在容易学习的原则下，我们赞成用字母来拼缀。不过各种新文字方案的字母形式是很复杂的，主要可为四类：
    （１）用汉字系统的字母，
    （２）用拉丁字母，
    （３）用速记术代表拼音的字母，
    （４）用意义符号的字母。除了第四类以外，拼音的效果是同样的。
    在目前，大多数知识分子都还主张用拉丁字母，这是不必要的。当一九二三年以后，赵元任等创制了过于复杂，民众不能接受的国语罗马字后，一九三○年，中共瞿秋白同志制定了简单易学的拉丁化新文字，这在当时，完全是必要的，进步的。他毅然地放弃了声调，在文字改革的历史上是值得大书特书的。在革命工作里，这种新文字运动，也曾起了巨大的作用。
    但是到了现在，全中国已将完全解放，经济建设，文化复兴，都是当前的重要任务，骤然改为一种和人民习惯脱离很远的新文字，就不很适宜。在群众里面，民族形式化较容易接受，所以我们只有采用民族形式，才可以打破一部分的习惯。在目前固执外来的旧形式，只用拉丁字母，而不去创造适合于这个环境，这个民族的新形式，这不是实事求是的办法。
    由于中国的半殖民地性质，由于明朝的传教士就用罗马字拼音，养成了学者间只承认拉丁字母是最便利的，和“既然罗马字母在西方完成了一个空前的工作，它必须也在东方完成同样的工作”这种出自美国传教师的夸大的想法。（见倪海曙中国拼音文字概论）许多歌颂拉丁字母者，最大的理由，只是国际化。其实中国新文字即使用拉丁字母，所代表的还是中国的语音，那末，所谓国际化，也只是二十几个字母的形式。可是在先进的苏联，就只用俄文字母而不用拉丁形式。我们无论用哪一套字母，都可以拼音，又何必一定要用拉丁字母的形式呢？
    目前改革文字主要是为的实用。汉字是不能一下就废弃的，假使单单学会一套拉丁化新文字，依然不会汉字，依然没有大批书报来阅读，是没有用的。如果要用综合文字，还保留一小部分的汉字，那末，所有大部分的新文字，只有用汉字系统的字母，才能配合。假定拉丁化新文字用ＺＨ两个字母来代表“知”的声母，我们却只用“之”字来代表；拉丁化用ＢＡ来代表“巴”字，我们却写做“北Ｙ”；这有什么两样呢？从学过外国语文的人看来，当然容易觉得ＡＢＣＤ比较通行，但在初学的人是一样的。因为从字母所代表的语音来说，汉字字母和拉丁字母，完全是一样的。
    有人以为拉丁化新文字用的是中国语言，就是民族形式，这完全是错误的。用中国的牛肉，做出美国式的半生不熟，血淋淋的牛排，难道不是番菜？难道能使中国人民大众都爱吃吗？
    用外来形式的拉丁字母，和用民族形式的汉字系统字母，粗看起来，所差只在形式，但是发展下去，整个系统就不同了。用拉丁字母就和汉字对立起来，汉字不消灭，新文字就很难发展，就讲不到代替汉字。如其用汉字系统字母，就可以和一部分旧汉字结合起来，这种新文字将完全代替旧汉字，一切矛盾就完全统一了。
    　　　　新文字的拼法—两合音
    一个字的拼法，在原则上是越简单越好。中国语言的音素，有许多是很难分析的，例如：“之”，“尺”，“尸”，“日”，语音学家固然可以把它们分出一个韵母来，国语罗马字就是这样做，但这是语音学家的事情，一般民众是完全不需要的。
    在这一点上，注音字母因为采用汉字系统的字母，就比拉丁化新文字和国语罗马字简单；王照的官话合声字母，劳乃宣的简字，因为用的是几千年来惯用的反切形式，所以更比注音字母简单。注音字母受了音韵学家的影响，要分出四等，因而有介音字母，因而某些字要用三个字母来拼成。这种三合音的办法，对于民众是不习惯的，不容易学习的。王劳两家把介音字母“乙”、“五”、“于”，包括在声母里面，因之字母要多些，但每一个字的拼法，只有两个字母。这种世界上最简单的拼法，如“不用”两个字，可以读做“甭”，是人人都会的，是最合于中国语言特质的。
    中国旧式的反切，很不容易学习。现在的两合音，形式相同，但是本质上完全两样了。这是简单易学而又十分确切的。这是中国两千年来音韵学的结晶和近代科学结合起来的产物，再有了拉丁字母或国际音标作对照，这种拼法尽管简单，决不怕有错乱的危险了。
    　　　　对于声调的处理
    汉字本就不注声调，只有在特殊需要时注一下，或用圈号表示出来。王照劳乃宣和注音字母才注上了声调符号。国语罗马字因为用的是外来形式，装不上国产的声调符号，就只好在拼法里出花样，一个字构成的字母，有些是字音，有些是声调。一个字母，忽而是字音，忽而是声调。例如“使用法”三个字，写成ＳＨＹＹＹＯＮＱＦＡＡ，这里有三个Ｙ，两头都是字音，（是两个字的）中间乃是声调。这种混淆不清的笨拙的写法，是如何的难学啊！
    拉丁化新文字放弃了声调（只在几个特殊例子上是有分别的，）无论在学习的方面，在写法的方面，都是高明的，英果的办法。当然它本身有缺点，但就由于它的简单，才能在普及的一点上获有成效。
    语言和文字是有距离的，说话时的神气态度，以及语音的高低轻重快慢，在文字里都是写不出来的。语言的声调，虽然普遍地存在着，但是各地方都不一样，把声调严格地规定在文字里面，要人去学，是做不到的。从王照以来，一直到国语罗马字，都走了这一条错路，要人学北京语的声调，所以就变成统一国语而不是改革文字了。
    汉字不注声调，同是这个上字，上楼的上是上声，楼上的上是去声，一念出来自然有分别。王照以来，因为要离开汉字的形式，全仗拼音，才不能不注声调来避免同音字太多的难关，也因此就走上了一条歧路。
    综合文字保留了一部分的汉字，因之，它可以采取汉字和拉丁化新文字的长处，对于补充进去的新文字，只有拼音，不管声调。由于汉字还是骨干，所以不怕同音字的混淆。这种新文字的形式，将是最简单的。但是，在必需时，它依然可以特别注上一些符号的。
    　　　　新文字的两种形式—基本形式与完全形式
    初期的拉丁化新文字是有缺点的。由于中国语言的同音字太多，在谈话时，有时间和环境的限制，所说的主题，大家都可以了解，说话的神气态度，又都可以帮助了解，所以除了一部分特殊名词或专门知识外，就不会发生多少困难。等到写在纸上，对于一个陌生生的读者，地隔千里万里，时过十年百年，如其只拼出一些声符，而这种声符有时要代表几十个同音字，那就一定要莫明其妙了。固然有些地方是可以揣测出来的，但是读者的时间是宝贵的，要他去东猜西想，就不如干干脆脆读一目了然的另一种文字。
    所以拉丁化新文字只在普及时是有显著成绩的，一到提高文化，就遇到许多实际的困难了。有些新文字工作者要补救这个缺点，把文字分化的例子扩大起来，主张定形化，主张变体字，这样把初期的简单的长处破坏了，又从新变成复杂。国语罗马字是完全根据语音的，虽是复杂，还有条例可寻。到了新拉丁化，只是人工的分化同音字，字母的增加或改变，没有条例，没有意义，那就等于是新的符号，就全靠学者去死记了。
    徐特立同志说：
    新文字推行的困难，由于知识分子有汉字作工具，又知道外国语文。因此，赞成新文字者就企图定形化，以便代替汉字，把新文字加上一些符号，增加文盲学习的困难。另一部分知识分子，以新文字本身有许多缺点，专用自己知识去找新文字的缺点来反对新文字。他们并不注意失学的贫民，只有不周密的文字才易学，才易普及。——张雁中国新文字概论
    这一段话，从普及的观点来看，是完全正确的。不过在目前中国环境里，也不能只普及而不顾到提高。初期新文字不可讳言是有缺点的。新拉丁化尽管加上符号，增加文盲学习的困难，但也还不能完全代替汉字。
    其实，旧汉字既然不容易废除，就可以设法少学，用最经济的时间，学一部分最简单的汉字，而在汉字不够用时，再加上了一套简单的拼音文字，那就成为前面所说的综合文字了。这样的拼音文字，就不一定要代替汉字。只要把新文字的形式跟汉字取得一致，由拉丁字母改为汉字系统字母就行了。这样的综合文字，很有些象日本文字，汉字和假名混合在一起。近年来，日本人已经把汉字逐渐限制和减少，我们一方面保留一部分汉字，一方面发展拼音文字，正可以接受这一项经验。
    这种综合文字，对于初学文字的人是十分便利的。学几百个汉字，再学一套拼音，就可以读一切用综合文字来写印的书报了。在自已要用文字来表达时，有汉字就写汉字，写不出就写拼音。总之，只有要学一部分汉字是比较要费时间的，此外就和初期拉丁化一样的简单，一样的容易学习了。
    这是这种新文字的基本形式，虽则有了一部分汉字做骨干，比较已经容易了解，但是单用拼音的部分，仍旧有同音字的困难，有些时候，仍旧不能一目了然，不过比初期拉丁化完全靠拼音好一些吧了。在普及一点上，这已经是很好的工具，如果要提高文化，当然还是不够的。
    为了要配合高深的文化，这种基本形式，随时可以改为完全形式。旧汉字对于同音字的分化，本来全仗形符（即义符）的区别，“桐”是梧桐，“铜”是金属，“筒”是竹筒，一见偏旁就可以明了字的意义，这是新拉丁化的变体字，随意变换字母所不及的。我们的完全形式，就可以接受这种旧形式，并且接受了大部分旧形符，（当然有些不合理的形符是可以撤换的，）只是声符部分改用了新的拼法。这样的完全形式，几乎分化了所有的同音字，也几乎可以完全替代旧汉字。一切高度的文化学术，都可以用这种文字来发表，一切用旧汉字，写的著作文件，都可以用这种文字来转译。拉丁化新文字所有的缺点，在这里几乎完全取消了。但是它的拼法，依然是这样简单，这样容易学习，丝毫不用变动。普及和提高，在这里是完全统一了。（这种文字的详细计划，见我所著的“中国文字改革的理论和方案”，开明书店代售）。
    　　　　文字配合语言的问题——全国性的标准文字和方言文字
    中国文字过去受封建社会文化停滞性的影响，和文人偏重古典的束缚，所写的都是早已死亡了的语言，一般说起来，文字和语言好象是分离的。其实文字脱离语言，只是一部分的现象，鸡还是鸡，鱼还是鱼，肉还是肉；食字普通语言已不用，只说吃，但是鸟吃的东西，还叫食；作字普通已不用，但是泥水作，木作的作还通用。有些文字，如“厥”，如“矣”，已因语言的死亡而跟着僵化；有些文字，如“吧”，如“吗”，也因语言的进化而产生。所以过去有些作品，（象语录，诗歌，戏曲，小说等，）未当不能代表活生生的语言。语文分家，只是文学家的过失，而不是作为工具的文字本身的缺点。不过语言不断的进化，文字往往赶不上，方言文学没有发展，许多方言还没有创造出文字来，有些原来有文字的，急切间也想不出怎么写，这些缺点是由于文字变成了符号的缘故，只要有了拼音文字，这种情形就完全可以改善的。
    但是文字配合语言，决不能完全密切的。语言是容易变化的，容易受地域的限制，文字和语言配合得越密切，它的流行地域越窄隘；反之，越是能统一歧异语言的文字，从每一种方言来说，就距离更远。旧汉字跟现代方言是有很大距离的，但是它能统一了广大的区域，一个福州或广州人，跟一个北京人，说话几乎完全听不懂，写出字来是一样的。自从改革汉字的运动盛行以后，文字配合语言的问题，就特别提出来了。拼音文字将选择哪一种活语言作标准呢？还是从若干方言里综合出一种标准呢？还是随着纷歧的语言制定不同的方言文字呢？
    注音字母和国语罗马字是采用第一种办法的。它有客观的事实的根据，就是北京二百万人的语言。但是太客观了，配合得太密切了，要从声调语气各方面都讲究起来，都合标准，就不仅是改革文字而先要人工的统一语言了，这是做不到的，是走上歧路了。拉丁化新文字主张在全国划分几个区域，把每个区域里几百种不同的方言综合起来，制定方案，用文字来促进语言的统一。将来再把各区域的文字再融合成一种文字。（也有人主张先有全国统一的标准文字的。）这是第二种的办法。这种文字和每种方言都不密切，因之，它是人工的，没有语言根据的。读起来，每个小区域的人，就有懂有不懂，因之，对于选择的基础，就很容易起争论。各种方言由于政治经济和交通上的密切关系，将自然而然地谐合起来，但在一切客观条件还没有成熟，先主观地创造出某种标准语言，往往是有偏向的，或者是四不象。要把这种文字让群众学习，也是搞不通的。
    汉字原来是统一的，它虽只是文字的统一，而没有统一了语言，但是若干文字的读音，（和语音是分歧的）往往是接近的。这种接近，和政治经济交通等的关系是切不开的，因之，从宋元以来，作为政治中心的官话区域一天一天地在扩大。这种历史的事实，证明了用北京话做根据来统一文字读音的运动是正确的。
    现在，这种优越的条件，依然存在：由于中华人民共和国的首都是北京；由于北京话的语音成分比别种方言简单，比较容易学习；由于几十年来的统一国语运动的成果；因利乘便，用北京话来做新文字拼法的标准，总比没有标准好，也总比创造出一个标准好。
    但是我们不要要求严格的语音标准。文字终究只是文字，只要读得差不多就行了。北京近郊就有些人把“安”念做“囡”，尽可以你写你的ＡＮ他说他的ＮＡＮ，这样，文字和语言，依然会有某些距离。恩格斯曾经讲到英文的写法对于读音的适合性，引一个法国人说：“你写的是伦敦，但你读的是君士但丁堡”；我们可以看见同样一个字，伦敦人，苏格兰人，美国人所念的是不一样的；法国人，德国人，日本人念的更不一样；中国人念英文，北京人跟广东人也不会一样；所以要用一种方言来强迫人人学习得完全合标准，是不可能的。对于文字，只是规定了拼法，规定了每个字母所代表的音素，念的人不妨有一些参差，因为，这是无碍文字的统一，也就是写法（拼法）的统一的。
    过去汉字是统一的，目前，我们还要要求文字的统一，并且要强调这一点。但在另一方面，我们主张任何方言，或少数民族的语言，都可以自由的发展，写定为文字，而不加以人工的统一。这里是没有矛盾的，只有技术上的问题。假如采用北京话作为全国性的标准文字，它的字母将是最少的。有些官话区域能分尖团音，就要增加一些字母，吴语区域更要增加一些，闽语或粤语再增加一些，这样可以制定一套包括全国各地方言的字母，在任何一个区域里，都可以用他们自己的方言字母拼写出文字来了。
    文字是可以学习的，但是由于有些地域方言的显著不同，用方言文字来作普及的工具，是十分需要的。在有些文学作品里把方言的特征描写出来，读的人将会觉得分外亲切。但是完全用方言写出来的作品，是要受地域的限制的，全国性的法令文件以及著作，依然只能用全国性的标准文字。
    这样，全国性的标准文字和方言文字可以同时发展，语言的分歧，也不会妨碍文字的统一。学会了方言文字，再去学习标准文字是很容易的，而由于标准文字是统一的文字，将通行到全国每一个角落里去，所以更容易促进语言的统一。
    新中国的政治经济将有高度的发展，交通的联系，将要十分密切，各种方言将会很快地融合起来。作为文化交通的文字工具，一定要十分灵活地配合这一个时代。发展新的，不要把旧的一脚踢开；发展最广大地域可以流行的普通语言，也不要忘记了最小区域里少数人的特殊语言；这样，语言和文字的关系，才能真正地密切联系起来。
    　　　　文字改革和实际联系起来——文盲教育和儿童教育的改进问题
    改革文字是要行得通才行。徐特立同志说过，新文字“只有在文盲中有广泛的基础，才能巩固，”是完全正确的。但是在目前改革文字的目的，仅仅限于失学贫民，还是不够的，我们更得注意到儿童识字的问题，也还得照顾到已经有汉字作工具的知识分子改造学习的问题，这才是更广泛的基础，才能使这种新文字更能巩固。
    所以改革文字，固然要为的普及，却同时要注意到从这个普及的基础上去提高，而不是普及完了就撒手不管。学会了新文字，仍旧不能读一切书报，不能在任何地方广泛的运用，以致于普及是一事，提高是一事，把问题孤立起来，就是一种偏向了。
    假如这种新文字是综合文字，将会照顾到各方面的需要，一面改革旧汉字，一面创造新文字，而新旧之间又可以融合起来。它所用的完全是民族形式，所以是任何人所能接受的，但是它经过了科学的改造，所以又是容易学习，容易普及的。它是最简单的，合乎大众需要的，也是最完善，最周密的，可以担任起发展最高度的文化的。
    这样的新文字，将不是纸上谈兵，而立刻可以和教育问题联系起来。将用不着穷年累月地争论那些对于语音声调等等学究式的琐碎问题，而可以立刻去实践，在实践中去发现问题，研究问题了。
    教育问题很多，文盲教育和儿童教育是最基本的。目前的汉字，学习时十分困难，提倡简字，没有解决这个困难，只选择出一些常用汉字，限定用字数目，而不能配合语言，也不是彻底的办法。离开汉字而用拉丁字母的新文字，又和汉字对立起来。学了新文字还得学汉字，嫌于叠床架屋，白费精力；学了新文字，不学汉字，又苦于没有许多书报可读，用处太少。只有利用综合文字，才能解决这个问题，使文字学习时间，减少到最低的限度，如果能够有步骤的推行，最多不过十多年，可以把文字改革的计划彻底完成。
    这个工作的第一步是选择基本文字。首先是调查工人，农民，以及其他人民所最需要的是那些文字，再统计书报文件上所常见的是那些文字，再从教育家的立场来决定那些文字是人人必需要学习的。再由文字学家来选择，那些常用文字是最简单的，不可分析的，就把原来文字保留下来；有些常用的十分重要的字，而本字太复杂的，可以设法简化，或原来简化过的，就把简字保留下来；这两种就定为人人必学的基本文字。这种字不宜过多，以免多费学习时间，所以限定至多不能过一千个。此外文字尽管简单到不能分析，但不是日常必用的，可以放到字典里去。还有常用的文字而太复杂，又无法简化的，就改用拼音文字。当然拼音文字的字母，和文字的写法，是要经过详细讨论的。标准文字所代表的语言，以及方言字母的规定，也要经过精密的研究和讨论的。
    经过这些整备工作后，就可以着手编辑教科书和一切读物了。用综合文字来编辑教科书，首先要注意的，是把所有的基本文字由浅入深，完全包括进去，每个基本文字应该把各种用法尽量的用到了。在另一方面，对于教育的对象，例如：小学生，工人，农人等各部分需要的知识，以及政治，经济，科学，历史等，必需都能照顾到，在基本文字外，可以尽量利用拼音文字，那就不会受到文字的拘束了。
    当然，字典是必须要预备的。此外还得逐渐出版各种读物，一直提高到讨论专门知识的书籍。也需要小型报纸，逐渐发展到大型报纸和期刊。
    在实行之前，对于各级教育人员，当然要加以技术上的训练的。在实行以后，也一定要收集各方面的意见，和工作经验，随时随地来改进这一个计划。
    这个计划，可以在华北地区里面实验，先组织一个机构去整备这个工作，整备完成后，从小学校和文盲补习学校开始，第一期小学完成后，立即在中学里推行，到中学教育完成以后，就可以在全区里全面推行，再进一步，就可以推行到全国了。在实行时必须有整个的计划，即从最简单的到最高深复杂的读物，都得逐渐地预备好了，不致于到某一个时候，无书可读，成为文化断流的现象。那末，最多有十几年时间，旧汉字就一定可以推翻，新的综合文字一定可以成功，这种文字将解决了识字的困难，推进在新民主主义下发展出来的新文化，也一定会配合着语言的发展而孕育出更进步的新文字。
    改革文字和教育问题，需要联系起来。文字工具的改进，可以替教育工作者解决了一部分困难，使工作推进一步，但改革文字，又必须通过教育，才能实践。目前，改革文字者应该认清实际的需要，不要太偏重理想，拘守教条，而提出一些不能立刻实行的办法。教育工作者也不应该面对着一个严重的问题，不去设法解决。大家团结起来吧！创造出一种新文字，要一定能行得通，要一定能实践，要一定能成功！年青的一代正期待着我们。
