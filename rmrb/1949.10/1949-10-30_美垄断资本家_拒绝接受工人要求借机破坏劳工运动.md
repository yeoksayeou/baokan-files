Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 29th - New York dispatch: Due to the determination of a few steel monopoly capitalists to sabotage the labor movement by refusing to accept the reasonable demands of workers, the strike of over one million steel workers and coal miners in the United States continues. The steel workers are demanding that employers contribute one dime per hour per worker to a pension fund, a suggestion made by the "Steel Fact-Finding Board" appointed by Truman and agreed to by Philip Murray, president of the CIO. However, the monopoly capitalists, on the one hand, stubbornly refuse to implement the "Steel Fact-Finding Board's" recommendations. On the other hand, they mobilize reactionary newspapers to slander the strike daily and use this as an excuse to lay off workers in large numbers and raise prices, attempting to use this method to incite resentment among the general public and the laid-off workers against the strike.

According to a New York Worker Daily article cited by Teletype Agency: "American monopoly capitalists are deliberately prolonging the labor unrest and directing the newspapers they control to publicize the adverse economic consequences of the strike extensively. They are also placing large advertisements in newspapers, attempting to soften public opinion in order to achieve the goals of extending the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law and enacting more oppressive anti-labor laws."

The article pointed out: Although Murray believes that the strike was caused by a conspiracy by the financial interests headed by the Morgan family, attempting to destroy the United Steelworkers of America and the union movement, the CIO's senior leaders, headed by Murray, are focusing their efforts on inciting anti-communist hysteria instead of uniting various forces to defeat the monopoly capitalists.

### 美垄断资本家　拒绝接受工人要求借机破坏劳工运动

    拒绝接受工人要求借机破坏劳工运动
    【新华社北京二十九日电】纽约讯：由于少数钢铁垄断资本家决心破坏劳工运动，拒绝接受工人的合理要求，美国一百余万钢铁工人及煤矿工人的罢工，仍在继续中。钢铁工人的要求是每人每一小时的工作由资方贴补美金一角为养老基金，这本是杜鲁门任命的“钢铁事实调查委员会”所建议，并由产联主席莫莱所同意的。但是，垄断资本家一方面坚不实行“钢铁事实调查委员会”的建议，另一方面，则动员反动报刊天天诽谤罢工，并以此为借口，大批解雇工人，抬高物价，企图利用这种方法来挑起一般人民及被解雇工人对罢工的反感。
    据电通社引纽约工人日报的论文称：“美国垄断资本家故意使工潮拖延不决，并指挥他们所控制的报纸，大肆宣传罢工的不良经济后果，又在报纸上大登广告，企图软化舆论，以达到延长塔夫脱——哈特莱反劳工法及制定更具压迫性的反劳工法的目的。”
    论文指出：莫莱虽然认为罢工是由于以摩根家族为首的财政利益集团的阴谋所引起，企图摧毁联合钢铁工人工会及工会运动，但以莫莱为首的产联高级领袖们，却集中力量来掀起反共的歇斯底里，而不去联合各种力量，以击败垄断资本家。
