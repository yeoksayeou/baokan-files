　　The Story of the Elephant and the Little Snake
    Xià Yuán
    I
    The elephant's strength was unmatched. He was extremely popular in the great forest, but also faced opposition. Who welcomed him the most? The flowers and plants that had never enjoyed a single ray of sunlight under the great trees for countless generations welcomed him most because he uprooted the thick and strong trees; once the trees fell, sunlight poured in, and kissed by the sunlight, they grew twice as strong, and the flowers bloomed extraordinarily brightly.
    The exceptionally weak and always drooping horse lotus also welcomed him very much, because when the big trees fell, the horse lotus also saw the sunlight, so it straightened its back and quickly became strong, its whole body glowing.
    Not to mention the wild chrysanthemum, which was full of joy when it saw the sunlight, its face full of happiness. The morning glory was no exception, she laughed with a big mouth when she saw the sunlight, attracting the busy bees, laughing so hard that they bent over.
    There were many other friends who welcomed the elephant. The students of the grasshopper sports school jumped around happily; the frogs living by the clear pool sang merrily when they saw the sunlight; the golden eagle always sang songs of gratitude to welcome the sunlight.
    II
    But those stubborn old trees hated the elephant to the bone, gnashing their teeth and often cursing:
    "This damned beast, we can't face our ancestors unless we kill him!"
    Yes, the ancestors of the old trees had told them before they died not to give up their territory to let sunlight into this forest, otherwise the old tree species would be in danger of being eliminated.
    Opposing sunlight entering the forest and welcoming the boundless and profound rule of darkness was the entire traditional history of the old trees.
    Ever since the elephant was born, he had been at odds with the old trees. Why? Because the elephant pursued truth, he opposed the creators of darkness, detested the stubborn elements that blocked the sunlight, and eliminated the bad species that oppressed other creatures. Everything that obstructed the light and stood in the way of beautiful roads was opposed by the elephant. His dislike of the old trees was irreconcilable, it was either you die or I live.
    Only some of the stupidest birds who lived off the old trees and couldn't even sing were not as bad as the old trees. And especially close to them were the little snakes, who were related to the old trees. The old trees often discussed with them:
    "We must find a way to eliminate the elephant!"
    "Who says we shouldn't? We can't exist with that big beast."
    "Then what method should we use to eliminate him?"
    "We only need to wrap around him tightly, and he's done for!"
    "Right! Let's do it quickly..."
    III
    Could the elephant possibly fear these ridiculous and pathetic fellows? Of course not. He swaggered, held his head high, and marched forward righteously. The elephant stretched out his strong nose, grabbed the wrinkled neck of an old tree, and pulled it backward, and the tree crashed to the ground with a "crack" sound. As for the little snakes, some were timid. They had long since fled, disappearing without a trace; some pretended to be heroes, glaring and baring their teeth, muttering; some didn't know their own strength and attacked the elephant, crawling under the elephant's feet, and the elephant gently stepped on them, the little snakes were crushed to pieces, not even a shadow could be seen.
    The elephant's victory was a great joy to the creatures that longed for sunlight. The ants, to celebrate the elephant's victory, formed teams of thousands upon thousands to parade between the plump blades of grass; the larks were so happy that they didn't know what to do, shaking their wings and flying up to the high cloud cave, twisting and turning in the kaleidoscope-like beautiful sky.
    The little snakes were still not resigned, incited by the old trees, they crawled over in large numbers, wrapping around the elephant's legs. But the elephant raised his leg, and they either died or fled under the elephant's feet, so the old trees roared in anger. They stirred up earth-shattering gales, throwing the homes of all the lovely birds that welcomed sunlight and could sing poems from high up to far away, smashing them to pieces, and shaking the newly blooming flowers into petals, scattering them everywhere. But the elephant was not intimidated by these scenes at all, he consistently swaggered forward, holding his head high, swinging his huge nose, and when he saw an old tree, he just dragged it. The old tree crashed down, trembling with fear. The elephant did not stop, and when he saw an old tree, he pulled it again....

    IV
    The years came and went. In this forest, the dark places shrank smaller and smaller, and almost the entire forest was occupied by infinite light and warmth, and coldness and loneliness had become a thing of the past.
    V
    The nightjars took advantage of the beautiful moonlight to sing the epic of this forest gently and melodiously. Swarms of fireflies, in order to praise the prosperity of all things, flew all over the mountains and fields, illuminating the fertile land with sparkling light. Ten thousand blooming flowers and green grass emitted a rich fragrance. ...Larks, mynas, goldfinches, crickets, lalatani... all came out to play music. The white rabbit led his whole family out for a stroll. Could there be a more wonderful picture than this?
    This is not a fantasy! The elephant's affairs, the little snake's affairs, the old tree's affairs... were all things that really happened in this world not long ago.

　　大象和小蛇的故事
    夏园
    一
    大象的力气大得无法比。他在大树林里极受欢迎，但是也遭受反对。谁是最欢迎他的呢？千百辈子在大树林底下亨受不到一点儿阳光的花草最欢迎他，因为他把又粗又壮的大树拔倒；大树一倒，透进阳光，他们受着阳光的亲吻就长得加倍粗壮，开的花也分外鲜艳了。
    异常瘦弱的、总是垂头丧气的马莲也十分的欢迎他，因为大树倒下，马莲也见了阳光，于是挺起腰板，很快粗壮起来，全身都是光辉。
    野菊更不用提，见了阳光，兴致勃勃，满脸都是喜气。喇叭花也不例外，她一见到阳光大嘴欢笑，把忙碌的蜜蜂也引起来，笑得弯腰屈背。
    欢迎大象的朋友还多得很呢，蚂蚱体育学校的学生们乐的乱蹦乱跳；住在碧清池边的青蛙们，见到阳光就兴高采烈的唱起来；黄鹰为了欢迎阳光，总是唱着感谢的歌曲。
    二
    可是那些顽固不化的古树却恨透了大象，咬牙切齿，时常咒骂：
    “这个该死的畜牲，要不把他弄死就对不起祖先！”
    是的，古树的祖先们在临死的时候曾经叮嘱他们不准让出地盘让阳光进这树林，不然古树种族就有被淘汰的危险。
    反对阳光迈进树林，欢迎无边无际的深沉的黑暗的统治，这是古树们全部的传统历史。
    自从大象一出世就和古树做起对头来了。因为什么呢？因为大象追求真理，他反对阴暗的创造者，憎恶阻挡阳光的顽固派，排除欺压其他生物的坏种，凡是光明的障碍，美丽道路上的绊脚石都在大象所反对之列。他讨厌古树的感情是没有法子调和的，不是你死，就是我活。
    只有一些靠着古树过活的连歌都不会唱的最笨的禽鸟和古树比较不坏。而特别和他要好的还有小蛇，他们和古树结成亲戚。古树时常和他商量：
    “咱们一定得想法消灭大象！”
    “谁说不是的呀？有那个大兽就没有我们。”
    “那么用什么法子消灭他呢？”
    “我们只消用力一缠，他就完了！”
    “对！赶快下手……”
    三
    大象还能惧怕这些可笑亦复可怜的家伙么？当然不怕。他大摇大摆，昂扬着头，正直的前进。大象强壮无比的鼻子一伸就抓住衰老的古树皱纹斑斑的脖子，向后一拉，树便哔啦一声倒在地上。小蛇们呢，有的胆怯。早已＠之大吉，躲得无影无踪；有的假装英雄，瞪眼裂嘴，嘀嘀咕咕；有的不知量力，向着大象来进攻，爬在大象的脚下，大象轻轻一踏，小蛇粉身碎骨，影也看不见了。
    大象的胜利，在盼望阳光的生物们来说是极大的欢喜。蚂蚁们为了庆祝大象的胜利拉出千千万万的大队在丰肥的草叶之间游行；云雀乐的不知怎样才好，摇着翅膀向着高高的云彩的洞府飞了上去，在万花筒一样变幻多端的美丽的天空里扭起秧歌来。
    小蛇还不死心，受了古树的煽惑，大批大批的爬拢来，缠住大象的腿。可是大象把腿一举，他们又在大象的脚下死的死，逃的逃了，于是大树就怒号起来。他唤起震天动地的狂风，把欢迎阳光的能唱诗歌的一切可爱的俊鸟的住家从高处扔到远处，摔得稀烂，又把刚刚开得繁盛的花摇得碎成瓣瓣，各处飘零。但是大象丝毫也不为这些情景所吓退，他始终一贯的大摇大摆的往前进，昂着头，甩着巨大的鼻子，见了古树，就是一拖。古树轰然一声，战战兢兢的倒在地下。大象并不停歇，见了古树，又是一拉……。
    四
    岁月来的来去的全去了。在这树林子里，阴暗的地方越缩越小，无限的光明与温暖差不多完全占了全个树林的地方，寒冷与寂寞已成过去的事实了。
    五
    夜鹰趁着大好的月色温柔婉转的欢唱着这座森林的史诗。成群结队的萤火虫为了赞美万物的升平，飞遍满山满野，照得肥沃的大地发出闪闪耀目的火光。怒放的万朵花和绿色的青草喷出浓香。……百灵、八哥、黄雀、蟋蟀、拉拉谷……全都出来奏乐。洁白的兔领着全家出来游逛。还有比这个更妙的图画么？
    这不是幻想啊！大象的事，小蛇的事，古树的事……都是不久以前曾经在这世上千真万确地发生过的事。
