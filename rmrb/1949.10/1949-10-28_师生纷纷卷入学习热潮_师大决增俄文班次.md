　　Teachers and Students Enthusiastically Join the Learning Craze
　　Normal University Decides to Increase Russian Language Classes
　　[This newspaper reports] Since the Foreign Language Department of Normal University opened Russian language classes this semester, it has sparked a surge of learning enthusiasm among professors, lecturers, and students. When the list of elective Russian courses was posted ten days ago, there were particularly many people who signed up. As of the 25th, the total number of students in the university had reached 250. Several professors' wives even came. Whenever Russian class is in session, the classroom is always packed.
　　Almost all of the professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants in the Foreign Language Department (who have mastery of other foreign languages) have elected to study Russian. Jiao Juyin, the head of the department, excitedly said after listening to a Russian class: "I have always admired and respected the works of great Soviet writers. Unfortunately, I did not have a good opportunity to learn Russian in the past. Now it is good, I have ample opportunity to learn Russian. In the future, I can gradually directly absorb the construction experience and cultural achievements of the Soviet Union over the past thirty-two years." In addition to electing to take four hours of Russian per week, some students from the Science and Education College even travel from outside the university to Shifuma Street to attend classes. Everyone's enthusiasm for learning has encouraged Professor Gong Chunqing, He Wanfu, and other teachers of Russian. After teaching the required hours, Professor Gong voluntarily added two hours per week without pay. To facilitate everyone's learning, the Foreign Language Department has now decided to add classes. At the same time, to take care of the working hours of faculty and staff, it is planned to move the class time to the evening; when possible, more teachers will be hired.

　　师生纷纷卷入学习热潮　
    师大决增俄文班次
    【本报讯】师大外语系自本学期开设俄文课以来，在教授讲助同学之间，激起了高涨的学习热潮。当选修俄文的课表于十日前贴出来的时候，报名的人特别多，截至二十五日，全校已达二百五十人之多。更有几位先生的妻子也来了。每当上俄文课时，教室里总是挤得满满的。
    外语系的教授、讲师和助教（他们是掌握其他外国语文技术的）几乎全体选修了俄文。系主任焦菊隐在听完俄文课后，兴奋地说：“苏联伟大作家们的作品，我一直是爱好与钦佩的。可惜，在已往没有很好的机会学习俄文。今天好了，我有很充分的机会学习俄文了。以后可以逐渐地直接吸取苏联三十二年来的建设经验与文化的结晶。”理教学院的同学除选修每周四点钟俄文以外，有的还自和外赶到石驸马大街来听课。大家的学习热情，鼓舞了教授俄文的龚纯青、何万福等先生，龚先生在授完规定的钟点后，又自动地无报酬地每周增添了两个钟头。外语系为便利大家的学习起见，现已决定增设班次，同时为了照顾教职员的工作时间，拟将上课时间移至晚上；在可能时，还要加请教员。
