Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, October 9th: According to journalistic sources and newspapers, the Hague Round Table Conference has entered a difficult situation due to hard-to-resolve financial and economic differences. It is pointed out that under pressure from the United States, Hatta has agreed that the future so-called United States of Indonesia government will bear a considerable portion of the debts owed by the Dutch colonial authorities, including all pre-war and wartime debts, as well as a portion of post-war debts. As a result, the Indonesian people will have to spend billions of guilders to repay the debts of Dutch colonial imperialism, and Indonesia will in effect be enslaved again. In Indonesia, opposition to Hatta's delegation is growing. Even the Islamic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Indonesian Nationalist Party have expressed strong dissatisfaction with Hatta's concessions. It is reported that Sukiman, a central committee member of the Islamic Party, will soon leave The Hague for Yogyakarta to report in detail on the conference situation to the party's leadership, which is dissatisfied with the concessions made by Hatta's delegation.

　　海牙“圆桌会议”进入困境
    【新华社北京十一日电】据塔斯社海牙九日讯：据新闻界人士与报纸说：由于难于解决的财政经济上的分歧，海牙圆桌会议已进入困境。据指出：哈达在美国的压力之下，已同意未来的所谓印尼合众国政府，将承担相当一部分荷兰殖民当局所负的债务，包括一切战前与战时的债务，以及战后一部分的债务。因此，印尼人民将不得不拿出数十亿盾来偿付荷兰殖民帝国主义的债务，印尼将实际上再次受到奴役。在印尼，对于哈达代表团的反对，正日益增长。甚至回教党、社会党与印尼国民党都对哈达的让步表示激烈的不满。据息，回教党中央委员苏基曼很快将离开海牙赴日惹，向不满哈达代表团让步的该党领导机构，详细报告关于会议的情形。
