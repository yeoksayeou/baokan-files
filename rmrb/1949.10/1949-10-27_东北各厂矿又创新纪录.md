Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th. Following the recent issuance of three important documents by the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government regarding the implementation of economic accounting systems and the launching of mass movements to create new production records, factories, mines, and relevant organizations in Northeast China have responded with action. Gu Baoshan, a technician at the No. 2 open-hearth furnace of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, produced a batch of steel in five hours and fifteen minutes, setting a new record for steelmaking efficiency in the plant's history (the highest record during the puppet Manchukuo period was six hours). Huang Zifu and Xu Enlai of the Northeast No. 2 Textile Factory have set a new national record of one worker tending two and a half worsted spinning machines (1,100 spindles); in ten hours, each spindle produced 0.23 pounds of 32-count yarn. After the formation of this new record creation movement, the labor efficiency of all workers in the No. 2 Textile Factory was further enhanced, and technology was greatly improved. The number of workers tending 600 to 800 spindles has increased to 19. Since improving the iron smelting operation methods, the Shenyang Mechanical Experimental Factory has also created a new record of smelting 15.47 kilograms of pig iron per kilogram of coke, which can save more than half the coke compared to the general amount of about 7 kilograms of pig iron smelted per kilogram of coke. During the puppet Manchukuo period, a kilogram of coke could smelt a maximum of 14 kilograms of pig iron. In addition, new production records have recently emerged at the Fushun Mining Bureau's electromechanical factory, the mechanical factories of the Mechanical Bureau, and the Automobile General Factory. Other enterprise departments that are carrying out or have not yet launched this movement have not only conducted detailed discussions on the spirit of the aforementioned three major documents but also made thorough arrangements based on their own circumstances. The Benxi Coal and Iron Company, the Coal Mine Administration, the Rubber, Paper, and Cement Companies of the Enterprise Administration, the Smelting Factories of the Nonferrous Metals Administration, the factories under the Harbin Industrial Corporation, and several enterprises in Andong City are now preparing to launch the new record creation movement. The Cultural and Educational Department of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions recently issued a notice stipulating the specific methods and steps for all trade union cadres to study the three documents of the Northeast Bureau and the Industrial Department, and called on trade union organizations to specifically participate in this movement. The preparatory committee of the New Democratic Youth League of Shenyang City and the Youth Workers Department of the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions also convened more than 1,000 people, including youth league group leaders and above cadres from various factories, youth worker committee members of trade unions, and youth worker representatives to the Shenyang People's Representative Conference, and held a mobilization meeting, calling on every youth league member to strive to boldly break through the old production records and create various new records in different production positions, together with the trade union and all workers.

　　东北各厂矿　
    又创新纪录
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】中共中央东北局和东北人民政府工业部最近发布关于贯彻经济核算制与开展群众性创造生产新纪录运动的三个重要文件以后，东北各工厂、矿山和有关机关纷纷用行动来响应。鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂二号平炉技术员顾宝山，用五小时十五分钟的时间炼钢一炉，创造了该厂有史以来炼钢效率的最高纪录（伪满时的最高纪录是六小时）。东北第二纺织厂黄自福、徐恩来二人，业已创造了一人看精纺机两台半（一千一百枚纺锭）的全国新纪录；十小时中，每一纺锭产三十二支纱达零点二三磅。这一创造新纪录运动形成以后，第二纺织厂全体工人的劳动效率即进一步发挥，技术也大为提高，看六百枚至八百枚纺锭的工人已增至十九人。沈阳机械实验工厂自改进炼铁操作方法以后，也创造了一公斤焦炭熔化十五点四七公斤生铁的新纪录，较一般一公斤焦炭熔化七公斤左右生铁的数量，可节省焦炭一倍以上。伪满时期一公斤焦炭最多熔化生铁十四公斤。此外，抚顺矿务局机电工厂、机械局各机械工厂、汽车总厂等，最近也都有生产新纪录出现。其余正在开展或尚未开展这一运动的企业部门，除对前述三大文件精神作了详尽的讨论外，并根据自己的情况作了周密的布置。本溪煤铁公司、煤矿管理局、企业管理局橡胶、造纸、水泥各公司、有色金属管理局冶炼工厂、哈尔滨实业总公司所属各工厂及安东市若干企业单位，现正进行开展创造新纪录运动的准备工作。东北职工总会文教部最近发出通知，规定全体工会干部学习东北局和工业部三个文件的具体办法和步骤，并号召工会组织具体参加这一运动。新民主主义青年团沈阳市筹备委员会、沈阳市总工会青工部，也召集各工厂青年团小组长以上干部、工会青工委员和沈阳市人民代表会议的青年工人代表等一千余人，举行动员大会，号召每一个青年团员努力地、大胆地突破旧有的生产纪录，在各个不同的生产岗位上，配合工会和全体工人一道创造出各式各样的新纪录。
