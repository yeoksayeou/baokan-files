Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 10th: The first Shenyang Municipal People's Representative Conference, which convened in late September and lasted seven days, victoriously concluded on October 1st. After group and plenary discussions, the conference unanimously approved Mayor Zhu Qiwen's report on the work of Shenyang Municipality in the ten months since liberation, the report by Huang Oudong, Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on Shenyang's future tasks and current specific work, and the report by Deputy Mayor Jiao Ruoyu on the results of the proposal review.

In his report on the government's work, Mayor Zhu Qiwen pointed out that in the ten months since the liberation of Shenyang Municipality, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, through top-down takeovers, the Kuomintang's reactionary ruling machine was smashed, and the organization of the people's democratic government was gradually established. A new revolutionary order has been established, and a preliminary foundation for a new production order has also been laid.

He pointed out that the work of the Municipal People's Government still has many shortcomings and errors, mainly that the necessary transition from rural areas to cities has not been done well enough, experience in urban construction is still very poor, and there are still bureaucratic, formalistic, and paperwork-oriented work styles in leadership. Regarding future work, he pointed out that the focus should still be on restoring and developing production, organizing the people of the city, especially the working class, under the principle of everything for production and everything for creating social wealth, and creating a mass upsurge in economic construction. He also called on the people of the city to practice frugality and invest the money saved in production or deposit it in banks, using today's hard work to create a bright and happy future.

In his report to the conference on Shenyang's future tasks and current specific work, Huang Oudong, Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, pointed out that Shenyang's three major central tasks for the future are: First, to implement the principle of focusing on restoring and developing production; Second, to strengthen municipal management and construction; Third, to develop agricultural production in the suburbs of the city.

Deputy Mayor Jiao Ruoyu reported the results of the proposal review on behalf of the Proposal Review Committee: The conference received a total of 2,050 proposals, which were consolidated and organized into 190 items, classified and submitted to six groups—political, financial and economic, industrial and commercial, judicial and public security, municipal construction, and cultural and educational—for discussion, and then concentrated for research and review. It was decided that 17 items would be submitted to the conference for discussion; 108 items, because the issues involved were broad and required careful study, or were being handled or prepared to be handled by the government, were submitted to the government for research, reference, and handling; 33 criticisms and opinions were submitted to various departments for reference and review; and 32 items that could not be done in a short period or could not be done at all were deemed invalid.

After listening to these three reports, the conference conducted three days of discussions in representative groups. Each group unanimously expressed support for the three reports of Mayor Zhu Qiwen, Secretary Huang Oudong, and Deputy Mayor Jiao Ruoyu, believing that the government's work had made significant achievements, while also criticizing the shortcomings of the government's work.

In the closing ceremony on October 1st, Mayor Zhu Qiwen made a summary report, stating that the government would seriously and earnestly consider the more than 2,000 proposals received by the conference and would handle them practically according to their importance and urgency. He also accepted everyone's criticism on behalf of the government personnel and called for top-down inspection and education to change the work style.

In his closing remarks, Huang Oudong, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, emphasized that the spirit of democracy and unity of this representative conference must be conscientiously conveyed to the people to ensure that the resolutions of the conference are thoroughly implemented among the people.
