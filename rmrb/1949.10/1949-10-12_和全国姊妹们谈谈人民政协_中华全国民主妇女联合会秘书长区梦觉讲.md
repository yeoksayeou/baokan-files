Sisters across the country:

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has successfully concluded, and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has been proclaimed. This is an epoch-making event in Chinese history, worthy of celebration by all Chinese people and women.

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the organizational form of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front. Its representatives include the Communist Party of China, various democratic parties, people's organizations, regions, the People's Liberation Army, various ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic figures. Therefore, it signifies the great unity of the people of the entire country.

There were a total of sixty-nine female representatives attending the CPPCC, a new record for Chinese women truly obtaining political status. These female representatives, representing various democratic classes and social professions, have broad representation. Their election is due to the principle of equality between men and women under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. At the same time, the democratic parties and units also paid attention to this principle. The most important thing is that the contributions of Chinese women, especially working women, in the long-term people's revolutionary struggle have aroused all parties' attention to the strength of women and won everyone's support. This is the glory of Chinese women! It is also the glory of the Chinese people!

The task of this CPPCC was to formulate three great historical documents and create the Central People's Government. Among these three historical documents, one is the Common Program of the CPPCC. In the Common Program, there are clear provisions and special considerations for the protection of the rights and interests of women and children. Article 6 of the General Program clearly stipulates: "The People's Republic of China abolishes the feudal system that shackles women. Women have equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, educational, and social life. Freedom of marriage between men and women is practiced." In the chapter on economic policy, it is stipulated that "...special interests of young workers and female workers shall be protected..." In the chapter on cultural and educational policy, it is specifically stipulated that "National sports shall be promoted. Public health and medical services shall be promoted, and attention shall be paid to protecting the health of mothers, infants, and children."

The clear stipulation of these articles in the Common Program indicates that the life of Chinese women, who have been enslaved and oppressed for thousands of years, has truly come to an end. Chinese women truly stand up and unite with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao Zedong to strive to build a new China. At the same time, it shows that in a new democratic People's Republic of China led by the working class, the rights and interests of women and children are valued and truly guaranteed, which is incomparable to any capitalist country.

Now, this Common Program has been adopted at the plenary session of the CPPCC and has been adopted by the Central People's Government Committee as the Common Program of the Central People's Government. We women, in addition to warmly supporting such a common program that concerns the interests of 475 million people, must ensure its realization.

Our sixty-nine female representatives from all parties must earnestly convey and explain the important documents adopted by the conference after returning to their respective posts: the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Organic Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. We must serve the people seriously and responsibly, and combine the interests of women with the interests of the entire people. We must strengthen our learning, concentrate our efforts on studying the fundamental plan for building the country, study the many principles and policies in the Common Program, and strive to implement the CPPCC resolutions, in order to meet the expectations of sisters across the country.

At the same time, we hope that sisters across the country, especially women's organizations and female cadres in various jobs, will study the important documents of the CPPCC carefully, and conduct extensive publicity and explanation among the women masses.

We hope that sisters across the country must work hard to study government work, enrich our various knowledge, and improve our abilities, so as to improve ourselves politically, so that we can participate more and more in the management of public enterprises and the management of the country, so that we can better serve the people.

We hope that sisters across the country will work hard to study and actively participate in the economic construction and cultural and educational undertakings of the new China. We must learn to master various industrial and agricultural technologies, improve women's cultural and scientific level, and work together with the people of the whole country to strive for the rapid restoration of war wounds and embark on the road of independence, democracy, peace, unity, prosperity, and strength for the people's motherland! In this regard, the path taken by our international comrades-in-arms—our Soviet sisters—is worth learning from. Their efforts in the process of nation-building, their achievements in culture, art, education, and science, and their achievements in women's and children's welfare are all things that women across the country should learn from.

The task of building a new China should be the central task of the Chinese women's movement in the future. We women must turn the resolutions of the conference into practical actions to celebrate the birth of the new China.

　　和全国姊妹们谈谈人民政协
    中华全国民主妇女联合会秘书长区梦觉讲全国姊妹们：
    中国人民政治协商会议已经圆满结束，中华人民共和国中央人民政府已宣告成立，这在中国历史上是一件划时代的大事情。值得我们全中国人民和妇女欢欣鼓舞的。
    中国人民政治协商会议，是中国人民民主统一战线的组织形式。它的代表包括中国共产党，各民主党派，各人民团体，各地区，人民解放军，各少数民族，国外华侨及其他爱国民主分子，因此它标志着全国人民的大团结。
    这次出席人民政协的女代表，一共有六十九人，这是中国妇女真正得到政治地位的新记录。这些女代表，代表了各个民主阶级，和各种社会职业，具有广泛的代表性。她们被推选出来是由于在中国共产党领导下依照了男女平等的原则，同时各民主党派各单位也注意了这个原则；最主要的是中国妇女特别是劳动妇女在长期人民革命斗争中的供献，才会引起各方对妇女力量的重视，才为大家所拥护。这是中国妇女的光荣！也是中国人民的光荣！
    这次人民政治协商会议的任务是制定三个伟大的历史文献，产生中央人民政府。这三个历史文献中，有一个是人民政协的共同纲领，在共同纲领里面，对于保护妇女儿童的权益都有明确的规定与特别的照顾。总纲第六条中明白规定着：“中华人民共和国废除束缚妇女的封建制度。妇女在政治的，经济的，文化教育的，社会的生活各方面，均有与男子平等的权利。实行男女婚姻自由。”在经济政策那一章中，规定了“……保护青工女工的特殊利益。……”在文化教育政策那一章中，又特别规定了“提倡国民体育。推广卫生医药事业，并注意保护母亲、婴儿和儿童的健康。”
    共同纲领中明白规定这些条文，表明了数千年来中国妇女被奴役被压迫的生活从此真正的结束；中国妇女真正站立起来，和全国人民团结一致在中央人民政府和毛泽东主席领导下努力建设新中国。同时也表明了在一个由工人阶级领导的新民主主义的中华人民共和国里，妇女和儿童的权益的被重视，得到真正的保障，绝不是任何一个资本主义国家所可比拟的。
    现在，这个共同纲领已经在人民政协全体会议上通过，又经过中央人民政府委员会通过接受为中央人民政府的共同纲领。我们妇女，对于这样一个关乎四万万七千五百万人民利益的共同纲领，除了热烈拥护之外，一定要保证它的实现。
    我们六十九位来自各方的女代表，回到各个工作岗位后，一定要认真传达及解释大会所通过的几个重要文件：中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领，中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法，中国人民政治协商会议组织法。一定要严肃负责为人民服务，把妇女的利益和整个人民的利益结合在一起。一定要加强学习，集中力量研讨建设国家的根本大计，学习共同纲领中许多原则政策，为贯彻政协决议而奋斗，以符全国姊妹们的期望。
    同时，我们希望全国姊妹，特别是各地妇女团体和各种工作岗位上的女干部，好好学习政协的重要文献，并在妇女群众中作广泛的宣传解释。
    我们希望全国姊妹，必须努力学习政权工作，充实我们的各种知识，提高我们的能力，从而在政治上更提高一步，以便能更多更多地参加公共企业的管理和国家的管理，以便能更好的为人民服务。
    我们希望全国姊妹，努力学习并积极参加新中国的经济建设工作，新中国的文化教育事业。必须学会掌握各种工业农业的技术，提高妇女文化和科学的水平，和全国人民共同争取人民祖国迅速恢复战争创伤，走向独立、民主、和平、统一、富强、繁荣之路！在这方面，我们亲如手足的国际战友——苏联姐妹们所走过的道路值得我们学习，她们在建国过程中的努力，她们在文化、艺术、教育、科学各方面的成就，她们在妇女儿童福利方面的成绩，都是我们全国妇女应该学习的。
    建设新中国的任务，应该是今后中国妇女运动的中心任务。我们妇女一定要把大会的决议变成实际的行动，来庆贺新中国的诞生。
