　　Biographies of Wilhelm Pieck and Otto Grotewohl
    Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, was born in 1876. He started as a carpenter. At the age of nineteen, he joined the Social Democratic Party in Bremen. He served as Chairman of the Carpenters' Union. At the Social Democratic Party Congress in Nuremberg in 1908, he opposed the compromise policy of the party's leadership. During the First World War, he was arrested twice for opposing the passage of war expenses and organizing revolutionary activities. In 1918, he published the "Combat Newspaper" in the Netherlands. In 1932, he was elected as a member of the Reichstag by the workers of Berlin. In 1936, at the Brussels Congress of the German Communist Party, he was elected as Chairman. At that time, Pieck called on all anti-fascist organizations to unite, overthrow the rule of the Junker landlords and monopoly capitalists, and establish a democratic republic. After the end of the Second World War, in 1946, the Communist Party of eastern Germany and the Social Democratic Party merged to form the Socialist Unity Party, with Pieck as Chairman. At the seventh meeting of the Central Bureau of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in February last year, Pieck pointed out that the party's basic task was to fight for German unity and just peace. Pieck's life history embodies the revolutionary tradition of the German proletariat's internationalism.
    Otto Grotewohl, the new Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic, was born in Brandenburg in March 1894. He served as a city councilor and member of the Reichstag. He was originally a left-wing leader of the German Social Democratic Party. When the Social Democratic Party and the German Communist Party in the Soviet-occupied zone decided to merge into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in April 1946, Grotewohl and Pieck served as co-chairmen.
