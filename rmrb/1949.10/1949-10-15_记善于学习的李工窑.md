　　A Record of Li Gongyao, a Good Learner
    Fu Guanglin
    There is a comrade named Li Gongyao in the Infantry School. He is short and stocky, with a red face. The only thing that makes him unhappy is the small black mole under his left eye, which he often touches. In the army, he is a person I often think of. Last winter, I joined the army and was assigned to the same class as him, where I served as the study group leader. Every time it was mealtime, he would call out to me, "Lao Fu, it's time to eat!" and he would get chopsticks, bowls, and serve me rice. Sometimes when I picked up a basin to get food from the kitchen, he would quickly snatch it away from me, "I'll go, you haven't done it before..." This really made me feel the revolutionary comradeship! However, I was not the student he imagined who "hadn't even gotten food before," so I tried to seize opportunities to do labor. Comrade Li Gongyao seemed to see what I meant. While holding his small pipe, he stroked his literacy textbook and said to me, "Let us do the work, you just focus on teaching culture..." So I encouraged him: "Just ask if you don't understand, I'm not afraid of trouble."
    Later, whenever I was in the room, I would have a "student" by my side—Li Gongyao. At first, he was reading a fairy tale translated by Mr. Zheng Zhenduo—Reynard the Fox, but he only read the Chinese characters sporadically. After I pointed out the principle of "ask if you don't know," he would ask about any unfamiliar characters; as for what the story was about, he didn't care at all. At this time, the comrades in the class were all interestingly watching him: "Hey, Li Gongyao really wants to make a revolution against being illiterate!" But sometimes they mocked him: "Oh, Li Gongyao can't even figure out how many bowls of rice he's eaten," they pointed at Reynard the Fox: "That's what college students read!"
    One day, it was Sunday, and we were eating fine noodles. The class borrowed a pot from the villagers to cook it ourselves. Comrade Li Gongyao suddenly enthusiastically brought out a dusty "Children's Textbook" from the inner room. He approached me and said solemnly, "This is a good book, I recognize quite a few..." He opened the first page and pointed to the words on it with his finger: "Watch me read: Gu, what?" I told him the next word was "shi". But the third word "hou," he still said "what"; I patiently told him again. He then easily read the two words "de ren," but he didn't recognize the sixth word again. At that time, I saw sweat beads popping up on his forehead, and he embarrassedly raised his head to swear to me, "You teach me well, if I don't learn it, I'll take away my Li surname!" From then on, he put down Reynard the Fox and concentrated on reading this book. He often looked up and asked me: "In three months, can I learn to write a letter?" I encouraged him: "It's not difficult."
    In just over ten days, he actually finished reading the "Children's Textbook." In a state of high spirits, he began to study the newspaper. The comrades in the class still said mocking words face to face: "Hmph, the illiterate is still ambitious? Can't even remember his own name!" In fact, Li Gongyao was very clumsy. He would read a character five or six times in a row, but he still couldn't remember it firmly, but he had ample reason to comfort himself: "Who told our family to be poor when I was little! When I joined the army, I was just fighting battles, how could I have time to learn culture... and no one taught me!" The more he talked, the more excited he became, muttering to himself: "As long as the study group leader doesn't mind the trouble, I'm not afraid of being stupid." He honestly admitted that he was stupid, but he didn't bow his head to stupidity, and just kept working hard.
    I came from a "student" background, so naturally "student" shortcomings sometimes appeared. I felt that teaching comrades culture every day, what great contribution would this make to the revolution? So I began to feel a little annoyed! When I was fed up, I severely criticized Li Gongyao for "not using his brain," but he immediately noticed my impatience. While smoking his small pipe, he stroked the small mole on his face and said very proudly to me: "If you teach us all to be cultured, this is your revolutionary achievement!" I immediately felt as if I had been hit on the head with a stick. I shamefully told him: "Just ask, I won't be afraid of trouble anyway!"
    Three months passed, and Li Gongyao really made amazing progress. At that time, he received a letter from home. He picked up a pen dipped in water under the electric light and excitedly said to me: "I'm writing a reply, you can correct it for me!" I sized up his confident appearance, and really thought he "couldn't even figure out how many bowls of rice he'd eaten!" But I underestimated him. I still remember the letter he wrote for the first time: "Dear Father, you said that Xiao Wu (the landlord's student) is smart, I don't believe him, this is my letter, I learned it, it didn't cost any money..." The company instructor praised Li Gongyao in front of the company, and all the comrades exclaimed: "It's too extraordinary." Afterwards, his "clapper talk" and "articles" were continuously published on the wall newspaper, and he was invited to be a correspondent for the wall newspaper.

　　记善于学习的李工窑
    傅广霖
    步兵学校里有一位李工窑同志，他是个短粗的个子，发着红光的脸上，只有一点使他心里不痛快的地方，那就是他常常用手摸着的左眼下的小黑猴子。在部队上来说，他是我常常想起的一位人物。去年冬月，我参了军，和他编在一个班里，我担任学习组长。每到吃饭的时候，他便喊着我：“老傅，吃饭啦，”还给我拿筷拿碗、盛上饭。我有时拿起盆到伙房打菜，他便赶紧给我夺过去，“我去吧，你没做过……”这真使我感到革命同志的友爱！然而我并非他所想象中“菜也没打过”的学生，所以我尽量抽机会争取劳动。李工窑同志仿佛看出我这意思来，他一面端着小烟袋一面抚摸着识字课本对我说：“有活叫我们干，你努力教文化就行了……”，我于是鼓励他：“你不懂的就问，我不怕麻烦”。
    后来，我只要在屋里的时候，身旁就会傍着一个“学生”——李工窑。他最初是念一本郑振铎先生翻译的童话——列那狐，只是隔二抛三的读方块字。经过我指出“不会就问”的道理后，他就见生字就问；至于上面说些什么事，他丝毫不去理会。这时候，班里同志都在有趣的注意着他：“嘿，李工窑真想革老粗的命啦！”但有时是嘲笑他：“咿，李工窑闹不清自己扒几碗干饭了，”他们指着列那狐：“那是大学生念的书啊！”
    一天，那是星期日，吃细面，班里借老乡的锅自己做。我在锅下烧火，李工窑同志忽然从内屋里热情的捧出一本满是灰尘的“儿童课本”来，他靠近我郑重的说：“这是本好书，我认得好些……”他翻开第一页，用手指点着上面的字：“你看着我念：古、什么？”我告诉他下一个是“时”字。但第三个“候”字，他还是“什么”住了；我又耐心的告诉他。他接着轻松的读了“的人”两个字，但第六个字又不认的了。当时我见到他额上的汗星冒出来了，他难为情的抬起头来向我宣誓，“你好好的教我，我要学不会，我把我李字拘了！”从此，他就放下列那狐，安心的读这本书，他常常抬起头来问我：“三个月，能学会写信吗？”我鼓舞他：“不难”。
    十几天的工夫，他竟然读完“儿童课本”，他在饱满的情绪下开始学习报纸了。班里同志仍然面对面的说些嘲笑的话：“哼，老粗还心高呢？真的闹不清自己姓啥了！”实在的，李工窑粗笨得很，他一个字连续五六遍，还是照样记不牢稳，但他却有充足的理由安慰自己：“小的时候谁叫咱家穷来呢！当了兵，净打仗，那有空学文化，……也没人教给咱呀！”他越说越起劲的自我叨唠：“只要学习组长不嫌麻烦，我就不怕笨。”他老实的承认了自己笨，但他并不向笨低头，就这样努力下去。
    我是“学生”出身，自然“学生”的臭毛病有时就出现。我觉得天天教同志们学习文化，这于革命有什么大贡献呢？于是开始感觉到有些厌烦了！我烦透的时候，就严厉的批评李工窑“不用脑筋”，但是他立刻发现了我的不耐烦，他一面吸着小烟锅，一面用手抚摩着脸上的小猴子，很神气的对我说：“你把我们都教的有文化了，这是你革命的功劳啊！”我顿时觉得头上挨了一棒似的，我惭愧的向他表示：“你尽管问，我反正不会怕麻烦！”
    三个月过去了，李工窑果然有了惊人的成绩。那时他接到一封家信。他在电灯下摸起沾水钢笔来对着我兴奋地说：“我写封回信，你可给我改！”我啾着他那种颇有信心的神气，实在是有点“闹不清扒几碗干饭了！”但我把他过低估计了。现在我还记得他初次写的那封信：“大人父亲，你说小五（财主家学生）精，我不服他，这是我的信，学会了，没化钱……”连队指导员在队前表扬李工窑，全队同志们都惊叹着：“太不简单了。”以后，他的“快板”和“文章”不间断的披露在墙报上，并且被约为墙报的通讯员。
