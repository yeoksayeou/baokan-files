　　Overcoming the Worst Flood in Fifty Years
    Beijing Suburbs Achieve Seventy Percent Yield
    350,000 Mu Wheat Planting Plan Nears Completion
    [Beijing News] Under the leadership of the People's Government, farmers in the Beijing suburbs have overcome the flood and achieved a seventy percent yield. The autumn harvest is now complete, and wheat planting is nearing completion. This summer, the Beijing suburbs experienced excessive and prolonged rainfall, coinciding with the crucial period of crop heading and grain filling. Many low-lying areas in the suburbs, with long-neglected and dilapidated rivers and canals, suffered from waterlogging and crop submersion due to heavy rainfall; or crops were flattened due to soil loosening, resulting in the worst flood in the Beijing suburbs in fifty years. In addition, there were also disasters such as wind, hail, and insects. A total of 351,740 mu of cultivated land was affected, accounting for one-third of the total cultivated land area in the suburbs. However, thanks to the active digging of drainage ditches and the struggle against the flood under the leadership of the People's Government by all the farmers, more than 80 drainage ditches and more than 20 old canals were dredged, totaling about 70 li, and more than 54,700 mu of autumn fields were saved. Finally, the flood was overcome. According to statistics from the Suburban Work Committee, the average harvest in the suburbs still reached seventy percent.

    During the period when autumn crops were ripening, a "crop watching" organization that truly served the masses was established, abolishing the past system of "Qingtou" (crop watchers) who secretly stole while ostensibly watching the crops. In most districts, administrative villages were the units, and poor peasants, farm laborers, or militiamen were the backbone to establish crop protection brigades or autumn defense committees, while natural villages established crop protection groups to protect the autumn harvest and further assist in anti-espionage work. For example, the 15th and 20th districts had achievements in capturing bandits.

    During the autumn harvest and wheat planting, farmers in the suburbs also organized labor exchanges based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit to solve the difficulties of insufficient manpower and livestock power. At the same time, it also solved the difficulties of farmers concurrently engaging in petty trading or other side occupations. In order to expand wheat fields and lay the foundation for next year's production, the Beijing Municipal Farmers' Association Preparatory Committee led the masses to complete the preparations for wheat planting before and after the autumn harvest. In addition to mobilizing the masses to mutually adjust wheat seeds, the cooperative also prepared 360,000 jin of wheat seeds for farmers to exchange with other grains. In addition, the Cooperative Bank lent out 200,000 jin of wheat seeds to solve the difficulties of poor farmers. Many farmers also adopted improved varieties after testing. At present, the plan to plant 350,000 mu of wheat in the suburbs is nearing completion, exceeding one-half of the number of wheat planted last year.

　　战胜五十年来最大涝灾
    京郊区获七成年景
    种麦三十五万亩计划即将完成
    【北京讯】京市郊区农民在人民政府领导下，战胜涝灾，获得七成年景。现秋收已经结束，种麦即将完成。京市郊区今年夏季因雨水过大，且连绵太久，又值农作物出穗结实之际。郊区洼地很多，旧有河渠年久失修，雨大积水，庄稼即遭淹没；或因土松而倾倒，形成京郊五十年来所未有的涝灾。此外，尚有风、雹、虫等灾害。受灾耕地共三十五万一千七百四十亩，占郊区总耕地面积的三分之一。但由于全体农民在人民政府领导下，积极挖沟排水，与涝灾进行斗争，全郊区今年所挖排水沟八十余条，疏浚旧渠二十余条，长约七十余里，救出秋田五万四千七百余亩。最后终于战胜涝灾，据郊区工作委员会统计，郊区平均收成仍达七成年景。
    在秋禾将熟时，又组织了真正为群众务服的看青组织，废除了过去由“青头”把持，明看暗偷的看青制度。各区多以行政村为单位，以贫雇农或民兵为骨干，成立护青大队或秋防委员会，自然村则成立护青小组，保卫秋收，并进一步协助进行防奸工作，如十五区及二十区皆有捕获土匪的成绩。
    在秋收种麦期间，郊区农民又根据自愿与两利的原则，组织了拨换工，以解决人畜力不足的困难。同时也解决了农民兼营小贩或其他副业的困难。为扩大麦田，打下明年生产基础，在秋收前后，京市农会筹委会即领导群众完成了种麦的准备工作。除发动群众互助调剂麦种外，合作社并准备了麦种三十六万斤，由农民用其他粮食向合作社调换。此外，合作银行并贷出麦种二十万斤，以解决贫苦农民的困难。并有不少农民采用了经过试验后的优良品种。现郊区种麦三十五万亩的计划即将完成，超过去年种麦数目的二分之一。
