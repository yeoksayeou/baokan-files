[Hubei News] The joint bandit suppression efforts of the Hubei, Henan, and Anhui border regions have achieved brilliant results. Zhang Guoquan, Commander of the Huanggang Military Sub-district, who commanded the troops on the southern front of the Dabie Mountains (Yingshan, Luotian, Macheng area) to suppress bandits, returned from the front line and discussed the bandit suppression situation on the southern front in the past month. He said: Before September, most of the vast areas in the northern parts of Yingshan, Luotian, and Macheng, in the southern foothills of the Dabie Mountains, were occupied by bandits. Local secret agents and despots colluded with the bandits to establish reactionary organizations such as pseudo-autonomous associations and pseudo-county, district, and township governments, carrying out frantic looting and extortion against the masses and cruelly sabotaging our local work, causing great suffering to the masses. After our army entered, through education and mobilization, emphasizing that the troops should play the role of work teams and connect with the masses through practical actions, the masses saw our determination to repair roads, build fortifications, and suppress bandits, and quickly approached us. In the past month, the situation has changed greatly. Most of the Baojia chiefs who were controlled by the bandits in the past have now "contacted us for work"; the masses voluntarily led our army, delivered letters, captured bandits, and identified bandits. More than 200 people from the old Soviet area of ​​Lindian, Macheng, even took up knives and spears and cooperated with the troops to search the mountains for bandits for three days. With the unfolding of the mass anti-bandit and anti-despot struggle, the bandits became even more isolated. The bandits, because they were beaten every day, collapsed and turned to covert struggle against us. As a result of the unified and comprehensive suppression by Hubei, Henan, and Anhui in the past month, the entire command structure of large and small bandits in the Dabie Mountains has been crushed. The eastern and northern front troops captured alive the bandit leader Wang Xian, the pseudo-“Commander-in-Chief of the Hubei, Henan, and Anhui People's Self-Defense Army,” Fan Xun, the first deputy commander and chief of staff, and Yuan Chengying, the second deputy commander and commander of the first detachment and pseudo-Lihuang county magistrate. The bandits on the southern front did not escape this fate either. Chen Xinmin, the bandit "Commander of the Eleventh Detachment," and his deputy commander, Peng Chucai, and other pseudo-regimental commanders, company commanders, pseudo-county magistrates, autonomous association scientists, and township chiefs, a total of eighteen people, Zhang Jiwu, the battalion commander of the Hu Wei and Feng Chunbo bandits, Zheng Jiaxue, the pseudo-district chief of Macheng, Lei Zhen, the pseudo-company commander, Tu Xiquan, the pseudo-township chief, Chen Mianzhi, the pseudo-deputy county magistrate of Yingshan, Hu Jianzhong, the pseudo-self-defense regiment leader, Ye Weicun, the pseudo-township chief, Zhang Wenqing, the pseudo-deputy township chief, and Huang Zhimian, Jiang Jun, and Huang Shaochu, the pseudo-company commanders, and other old bandit leaders hated by the masses were all captured alive by us. At present, the large bandits in Yingshan, Luotian, and other places have been gradually wiped out, and the scattered bandits have collapsed or surrendered one after another. With the military progress of bandit suppression, the situation in the eight districts in the northern parts of Yingshan, Luotian, and Macheng, which were occupied by bandits in the past, has been opened up, and people's governments have been established in each district. The bandit suppression troops and the local government are now closely carrying out the work of thoroughly eliminating scattered bandits. In the future, we must be highly vigilant and repeatedly clear them out, and we should immediately seize the opportunity to mobilize the masses, clear and capture scattered bandits, overthrow despots, and completely eradicate the roots of the bandits in order to completely eliminate the scourge of bandits.

    张国权分区司令员纵谈南线剿匪情况
    【湖北讯】鄂豫皖边区联合剿匪，获得辉煌战绩。指挥大别山南线（英山、罗田、麻城地区）部队剿匪的黄冈军分区司令员张国权，前线归来，纵谈一月来南线剿匪形势。他说：九月以前，大别山南麓的英山、罗田、麻城北部广大地区，大部被土匪盘踞。当地特务、恶霸与匪勾结，建立伪自治会、伪县区乡政府等反动组织，对群众实行疯狂的抢夺勒索，对我地方工作残酷破坏，群众痛苦万分。我军进入后，经过教育动员，强调部队要发挥工作队的作用，以实际行动联系群众，群众看到我们修公路、筑工事，有剿匪决心，很快的接近我们。一个月来，情况就起了很大变化，过去被土匪控制的保甲长大部都向我“接头办公”了；群众自动给我军带路、送信、捕匪和认匪。麻城林店老苏区群众二百多人还拿着刀矛，配合部队上山搜了三天土匪。群众性的反匪反恶霸斗争一展开，土匪更加孤立了。土匪由于天天挨打，溃不成股，就改为对我采取隐蔽斗争方式。一个月来鄂豫皖统一全面进剿的结果，整个大别山大小土匪指挥机构都被打垮了，东线北线部队把匪首伪“鄂豫皖人民自卫军”总司令汪宪、第一副司令兼参谋长樊迅、第二副司令兼第一支队司令兼伪立煌县长袁成英等活捉了。南线土匪也没逃出这个命运，匪“十一支队司令”陈新民和副司令彭楚材等以下伪团长、中队长、伪县长、自治会科学、乡长等共十八人，胡渭、冯春波股匪的营长张继武，麻城伪区长郑家学、伪中队长雷震、伪乡长涂西泉，英山的伪副县长陈勉之，伪自卫团长胡健中，伪乡长叶维村，伪副乡长张文清，和伪中队长黄治绵、江俊、黄绍楚等群众所痛恨的老土匪头子都被我活捉了。现英山、罗田等地大股土匪已经逐渐肃清，零股土匪纷纷溃散或投降。随着剿匪的军事进展，过去为土匪盘踞的英山、罗田、麻城北部八个区的局面已经打开了，建立了各区人民政府，剿匪部队与地方政府现正密切进行彻底肃清散匪工作。今后必须高度警惕，反复清剿，并应马上抓紧发动群众，清捉散匪，打倒恶霸，彻底挖尽匪根，才能根绝匪患。
