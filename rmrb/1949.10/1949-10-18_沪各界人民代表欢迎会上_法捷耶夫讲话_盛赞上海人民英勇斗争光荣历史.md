Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th: Fadeyev, head of the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation, spoke at the Shanghai People's Representatives welcome meeting on the 15th. The full text is as follows: Dear friends!

　　On behalf of the Soviet cultural workers, I extend warm greetings to all Shanghai citizens and thank you for your kind reception of our delegation. I salute all democratic forces in the country united around the Chinese People's Government! I salute the Shanghai intellectuals dedicated to the people! I salute the heroic workers of Shanghai! You have made tremendous contributions to the Chinese People's Revolution, in the history of struggle against Japanese, British, and American imperialists, and domestic reactionaries. We Soviet people clearly remember the heroic demonstration on May 30, 1925, when the Chinese working class shed their blood on the streets of Shanghai under the guns and bayonets of British and American police. We also remember the two-month general strike of protest by Shanghai workers, supported by all progressive forces in China, which made their enemies tremble. The Soviet people also know about the heroic uprisings launched by Shanghai workers in October 1926 and February 1927 to assist the then National Revolutionary Army. Although these uprisings temporarily failed, they resulted in the general strike and general uprising on March 21, 1927, when the people of Shanghai, led by the workers, seized the city, enabling the National Revolutionary Army to enter the liberated Shanghai. The heroic struggle against Japanese aggressors in Shanghai in 1932 also deeply moved us. The glorious and heroic defense of Zhabei shocked the world. We remember the great role played by Shanghai workers, university students, and progressive intellectuals in recent years in liberating China, driving out foreign aggressors, and eliminating domestic reactionary forces who betrayed the motherland. We know how much strength the Shanghai proletariat has added to the ranks of the Chinese Communist Party! The Chinese Communist Party now leads all progressive national forces in China to build a great People's Republic.

　　Therefore, we are especially happy to pay tribute here to the heroic Shanghai, with its glorious traditions, to you, to our dear Chinese friends!

　　The victory of the People's Republic of China has brought the Chinese nation into the ranks of the most advanced countries in the world. From now on, the Chinese nation will stand gloriously alongside nations with highly developed civilizations! These nations point the way to world peace, progress, and democracy for all mankind.

　　The great revolutionary Sun Yat-sen also only hoped for such a free, prosperous, and civilized China. And the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong, have embarked on this broad road of freedom.

　　We Soviet cultural workers have come to China to lay a reliable road for the Soviet people to understand China's old culture, especially the new culture created by the Chinese people and its intellectuals. Because we Soviet people stand on the basis of equality and independence of all nations in the world, and express deep respect for the national culture of every nation that contributes to the spiritual treasure house of mankind!

　　From our side, we are very happy to exchange experiences in our cultural construction with you.

　　Long live the permanent and solid friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union!

　　Long live the independent, heroic, and industrious Chinese people!

　　Long live Chairman Mao, leader of the Chinese people!

　　Long live the great Stalin!

　　沪各界人民代表欢迎会上
  　法捷耶夫讲话
    盛赞上海人民英勇斗争光荣历史
    【新华社上海十六日电】苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团团长法捷耶夫十五日在上海各界人民代表欢迎会上讲话，全文如下：亲爱的朋友们！
    我代表苏联文化工作者向全上海市民致热烈的敬礼，并感谢你们对于我们代表团这样亲热的招待。向团结在中国人民政府周围的全国民主力量致敬！向献身于人民的上海的知识分子致敬！向上海英勇的工人致敬！你们在中国人民革命中，在反对日本及英美帝国主义者和国内反动派的斗争的历史中，曾经有过巨大的贡献。我们苏联人都清楚地记得一九二五年五月三十日英勇的示威运动，那时候中国工人阶级在英美警察的枪弹和刺刀下面，曾在上海的街道上流过他们的鲜血，我们也记得为全中国进步力量所支持的上海工人两个月的抗议总罢工，它曾使他们的敌人吓得发抖。苏联人民也知道一九二六年十月和一九二七年二月上海工人为了援助当时国民革命军而发动的英勇的起义。这些起义虽然暂时失败了，可是结果造成了一九二七年三月廿一日的总罢工和总起义，那时候上海人民以工人为首夺取了城市，使国民革命军进入了解放的上海。一九三二年在上海抵抗日本侵略者的英勇斗争事迹也深深的感动了我们。光荣的闸北英勇保卫战震动了全世界。我们记得上海工人、大学生、进步知识分子在近年来解放中国、驱逐外国侵略者和消灭国内叛卖祖国的反动势力的事业上，所起的伟大的作用。我们知道上海无产阶级对于中国共产党队伍增加了多么大的力量！中国共产党现在领导中国的一切进步的民族力量，来建设伟大的人民共和国。
    所以我们特别高兴，在这里，向英勇的、有光荣传统的上海市，向你们，向我们的亲爱的中国朋友们致敬！
    中华人民共和国的胜利，使中华民族进入世界上最先进国家的行列。从今以后，中华民族和具有高度文明的民族光荣地并立在一起！这些民族给全世界人类指出一条世界和平、进步和民主的道路。
    伟大的革命家孙中山也只是希望有这样一个自由的、富强的、文明的中国。而中国人民在中国共产党和它的领袖毛泽东领导下，踏上了这一广阔的自由的道路。
    我们苏维埃文化工作者来到中国，就是为了铺设一条可靠的道路来使苏维埃人民了解中国旧文化，尤其是那一为中国人民和它的知识分子所创造的新文化。因为我们苏联人民是站在世界上一切民族平等和独立的基础上，并且对于凡是对人类的精神宝库有贡献的每一民族的民族文化表示深深的敬意！
    从我们这一方面来讲，我们非常高兴和你们交换我国文化建设的经验。
    中苏两大民族永久的坚固的友好万岁！
    独立的、英勇的、勤劳的中国人民万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    伟大的斯大林万岁！
