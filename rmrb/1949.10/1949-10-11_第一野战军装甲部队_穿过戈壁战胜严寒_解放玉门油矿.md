Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, October 10th: A reporter from the Northwest Front reports on the First Field Army's armored forces, which marched 550 li in one day and night to liberate the Yumen Oilfield with astonishing speed. The report states: The First Field Army's armored vehicle unit departed from Zhangye on the evening of September 24th, advancing towards Yumen at a speed of 20-25 kilometers per hour, crossing the vast Gobi Desert from the snow-covered Qilian Mountains. Commanders and soldiers overcame the severe cold of the frontier autumn nights with unparalleled willpower. When drivers grew tired, they sang songs to boost their spirits and fight fatigue. As the unit passed through Jiuquan, the masses cheered along the roadside, further inspiring the commanders and soldiers to drive their vehicles forward swiftly and courageously. When they were six kilometers from the oilfield, workers and staff who had been waiting by the roadside for three or four hours to welcome the People's Liberation Army immediately erupted in thunderous applause and cheers, presenting an unprecedentedly enthusiastic scene on the frontier. Upon arriving at the mining area, the soldiers stepped down from their vehicles and marched in orderly ranks through two rows of people who were wildly cheering to welcome the Liberation Army, resting in the mining area's square. When the soldiers saw the intact oilfield, they felt infinitely gratified and said, "To protect the precious property of the people's motherland, enduring a little hardship is nothing." That night, because housing arrangements had not been made, half of the soldiers slept in the Gobi Desert. The next day, in order to firmly protect the people's motherland's property, the soldiers disregarded their fatigue and continued to clear out the remnants of bandits scattered in the mountains around the mine. On the afternoon of the 29th at 9:00 PM, they drove to Chijinbao, 60 li northwest of the mine, to encircle and suppress the scattered bandits, annihilating them all. They captured 33 enemy soldiers including a company commander alive. They seized two 60mm mortars, six light and heavy machine guns, 88 rifles, and two trucks. Local residents slaughtered sheep and cooked food to warmly welcome and treat the Liberation Army.

　　第一野战军装甲部队
    穿过戈壁战胜严寒
    解放玉门油矿
    【新华社西北前线十日电】西北前线记者报道人民解放军第一野战军装甲部队，于一昼夜内进军五百五十华里，神速解放玉门油矿的经过称：第一野战军装甲战车部队于九月二十四日晚由张掖出发，以每小时二十至二十五公里的速度，从积雪茫茫的祁连山麓穿过戈壁大沙漠向玉门急进。指战员们就以无比的坚强意志战胜塞上秋夜严寒的袭击。驾驶员们疲劳了，他们就用唱歌来提高精神，与疲劳斗争。部队路过酒泉时，群众夹道欢呼，更鼓舞着指战员们驾驶着战车迅速奋勇前进。当距油矿六公里时，伫立道旁等候三四小时欢迎解放军的工人、职员立即发出暴风雨似的掌声和欢呼声，呈现了塞上从所未有的热烈情景。到达矿区后，战士们即步下战车，然后以整齐的行列，穿过两排狂欢着欢迎解放军的人群，休息在矿区的广场上。当战士们望着完好无损的油矿时，都感着无限快慰地说：“为了保护人民祖国的宝贵财产，我们吃点苦也算不了什么。”当天夜里，因为房屋没有调剂好，战士们有一半露宿在戈壁沙漠上。第二天，战士们为了巩固地保护人民祖国的财产，不顾疲劳，又继续清剿流散于矿厂周围山中的残匪，并于二十九日下午九时乘车奔剿集结矿厂西北六十华里赤金堡的散匪，将其全部消灭。生俘残匪连长以下三十三名。缴获六○炮二门，轻重机枪六挺，步枪八十八支，汽车二辆。当地居民杀羊做饭，热烈欢迎和款待解放军。
