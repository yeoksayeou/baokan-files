Another unit of the PLA continued to pursue and annihilate fleeing enemy troops from west of Guangzhou. On the 17th, it annihilated the entire 414th Regiment of the 147th Division of the enemy's 39th Army in the southwestern area of Sanshui. On the same day, it also annihilated the entire guard battalion of the enemy's 70th Army in the Gaoyao area. The results of the battle are still being tallied.

Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 18th: A unit of the People's Liberation Army liberated Boluo County on the 16th. Another unit, after liberating Sihui on the same day, routed the enemy's 13th Army Corps headquarters south of the city, capturing over 500 enemy personnel including a major general-level section chief.

Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 18th: The surrender of the enemy's 103rd Division of the 39th Army in the Sanshui area was completed and accepted by the People's Liberation Army on the 16th. This enemy force was originally in the Fogang area. On the 11th, its subordinate 307th Regiment was annihilated in the Fogang battle, and the division headquarters led the other two regiments in a southward escape. On the 16th, it was again pursued and overtaken by the Liberation Army in the Sanshui area. Its rearguard of two battalions was immediately annihilated by us, and the remaining enemy forces were also surrounded. At that time, the division commander, Zeng Yuansan, immediately led the division's directly subordinate units and the 308th and 309th Regiments, totaling over 5,000 personnel, to surrender to the Liberation Army.
