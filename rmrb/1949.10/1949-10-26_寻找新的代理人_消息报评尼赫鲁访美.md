　　Izvestia Comments on Nehru's Visit to the United States
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th - TASS Moscow reports that Izvestia published an article on the 23rd, entitled "Looking for New Agents," commenting on Nehru's visit to the United States. Izvestia specifically described the situation of American capital invading India, stating: As early as during the Second World War, and especially after the end of the war, American monopoly capitalists began to intensively penetrate India, and have been quite successful in driving out their British competitors. According to estimates by the "Foreign Commerce Weekly," an organ of the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. goods imported to India in 1948 reached $298 million, compared to only $31 million in 1940. American capital has also dramatically penetrated India's industrial sectors. Now, as the United States feels the growing approach of an economic crisis, and as the Chinese people have ended the predatory exploitation of China by American monopoly capitalists, the U.S. ruling groups see India as an extremely wealthy market that can be used to export capital and sell goods, as well as a very valuable market for supplying raw materials. In short, the first idea of the U.S. ruling class is to economically enslave India, and attempt to brutally exploit the tens of millions of working people in India to somewhat alleviate the U.S. economic crisis.
　　Izvestia continued: The reason why the Kashmir issue interests the United States is not simple. The United States is trying to control India, not only economically, but also strategically. Kashmir is located in northern India, and the reason it is able to attract the attention of American monopoly capitalists is because of its strategic position.
　　Izvestia also pointed out: According to American and British newspaper reports, the situation in Southeast Asia related to the historic victory of the Chinese people was the central issue discussed in the recent talks between Nehru and American politicians. Due to the failure of the reactionary Kuomintang rule in China, the U.S. ruling groups are frantically searching for new docile agents in Asia to replace the reactionary Kuomintang as the pillar of U.S. imperialism against the national liberation movements of the Asian people. Therefore, the American imperialists have set their sights on the representatives of the Indian bourgeois nationalists. And these representatives of nationalism are constantly demanding to play a leading role in Asia.
　　For the economic, political, and strategic interests of Wall Street, the U.S. ruling groups are trying to turn India into a blind tool of the United States to suppress the national liberation movements of the Asian people.
　　Izvestia concluded: It is precisely this "idea" that promotes the U.S. ruling groups' policy towards India. These "ideas" are extremely similar to the "ideas" of American expansionists. The shameful failure of American expansionists in China is now known to the whole world, and they have brought unspeakable disasters to the Chinese people. Therefore, this "idea" has nothing in common with the interests of the Indian people.

### 寻找新的代理人  消息报评尼赫鲁访美

    消息报评尼赫鲁访美
    【新华社北京二十四日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯，消息报二十三日发表论文，以“寻找新的代理人”为题，评尼赫鲁的访美之行。消息报具体地说明美国资本侵入印度的情况称：早在第二次世界大战期间，特别是在战争结束以后，美国的垄断资本家即已开始紧张地渗入印度，并相当成功地逐出了他们的英国竞争者。据美国商务部机关刊“国外商务周刊”估计，一九四八年美国输入印度的货物达二亿九千八百万美元，而在一九四○年时仅有三千一百万美元。美国资本之同样激剧地侵入印度的工业部门。现在当美国感到经济危机的日益迫近时，当中国人民已结束美国垄断资本家对中国的掠夺性的剥削时，美国统治集团把印度看作是可以作为输出资本与销售商品的极端富裕的市场，以及极有价值的供给原料的市场。总之，美国统治阶级的第一个想法，是要在经济上奴役印度，是企图对印度数以千万计的劳动人民实行残酷的剥削，来多少缓和一下美国的经济危机。
    消息报继称：克什米尔问题使美国感兴趣的原因，并不简单。美国力图控制印度，不仅是在经济上，而且是在战略上。克什米尔位于印度北部，它之所以能够吸引美国垄断资本家的重视，就是因为它所具有的战略地位。
    消息报又指出：据美英报纸消息，在最近尼赫鲁与美国政治家会谈中，与中国人民历史性的胜利有关的东南亚形势，是讨论的中心问题。由于中国反动派国民党统治的失败，美国统治集团正疯狂地在亚洲寻找新的驯服的代理人，以代替国民党反动派，作为美国帝国主义对抗亚洲人民民族解放运动的支柱。因此美国帝国主义者就将他们的目光盯在印度资产阶级民族主义的代表们身上。而这些民族主义的代表们也不断要求在亚洲起领导作用。
    美国统治集团为了华尔街的经济、政治与战略上的利益，力图将印度变为美国的盲目的工具，用以镇压亚洲人民民族解放运动。
    消息报结语称：正是这种“想法”促成美国统治集团的对印政策。这些“想法”与美国扩张主义者的“想法”极端相似。美国扩张主义者在中国的可耻的失败现在已为全世界所共见，他们曾给中国人民带来了难以诉说的灾难。因此，这种“想法”是与印度人民的利益毫无相同之处的。
