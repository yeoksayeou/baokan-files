　　Xinxiang
　　[Xinxiang Dispatch] Late last night, after hearing on the radio that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference had victoriously concluded, electing Chairman Mao Zedong as the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Soong Ching Ling, Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, and Gao Gang as Vice Chairmen, and announcing the founding of the People's Republic of China, the telephones in various units in Xinxiang City immediately began ringing. The news spread throughout all government offices, schools, and factories like an urgent telegram. This morning, as soon as it dawned, the yangko teams, flower drum teams, and propaganda trucks from various government offices, organizations, factories, and schools were ready to set out. The sound of firecrackers resounded throughout the city, even more lively than celebrating the New Year.

　　新乡
    【新乡一日电】昨晚深夜从收音机听到人民政协胜利闭幕，选出毛主席为中华人民共和国人民政府主席，刘少奇、朱德、宋庆龄、李济深、张澜、高岗为副主席，并宣布中华人民共和国成立的消息后，新乡市各单位的电话机立时响起来，消息象急电似的传遍了全市各机关学校工厂。今早天刚露明，各机关、团体、工厂、学校的秧歌队，花鼓队，宣传卡车，即准备出动，鞭炮声响澈全市，比过新年还热闹。
