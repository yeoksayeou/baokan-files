　　Great News Spreads to the Countryside
　　Jinxian Normal School Chen Xingduo

　　In Zongshizhuang, Jinxian County, Shanxi, the autumn harvest is in full swing these days. People are harvesting in the fields, getting up before dawn and returning after dark. Dusk is the liveliest time in the village, with carts of golden grain ears being pulled into the village. Shouts of livestock, singing, and yelling—these joyful sounds make the village instantly lively. People only quiet down a little at dinnertime. At this time, the village's rooftop broadcast shouts clearly:

　　"Fellow villagers! Hey! Hey! Fellow villagers! I'm reporting a momentous piece of good news, a first in history! The Central People's Government of our People's Republic of China has been established in Beijing, and Chairman Mao has been elected Chairman of the Central People's Government!"

　　Before the broadcast was finished, people started talking to each other while eating: talking about Beijing, talking about Chairman Mao. Students returning from the city explained things to the people.

　　"Hey! Hey! Fellow villagers, for thousands of years, this time the Chinese people have completely stood up! Let those foreign reactionaries who bullied us get out, let those landlords and despots behave themselves, and let the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries tremble before us!..."

　　The listeners laughed happily, unconsciously put down their rice bowls, and slowly walked from their doorways to the streets. People gradually gathered under the broadcast rooftop.

　　"Hey! Hey! Fellow villagers, at the time of our government's establishment, the representatives of our People's Liberation Army guaranteed to wipe out the reactionaries completely; the workers' representatives guaranteed to work harder; the students' representatives guaranteed to learn their skills well and serve the people. We farmers can't fall behind others!"

　　The people crowded under the broadcast rooftop became even more enthusiastic when they heard this:

　　"That goes without saying, we farmers have never fallen behind."

　　"Now that we have land, we can grow cotton and peanuts. As long as the People's Government gives the call, we guarantee to produce more and better."

　　"With Chairman Mao leading us, we can move Mount Taihang into the sea."

　　The old man stroked his beard, talking about the darkness and evil of the landlord's rule in the past, and the difficulty of engaging in struggle and achieving liberation.

　　Young people talked to each other about the construction of the new China.

　　Children put circles made of grain ears on their heads and twisted around everywhere.

　　Some people looked forward to the lively scenes in the people's capital—Beijing.

　　Some people went around looking for the comrades who had just broadcast, wanting to ask more details.

　　The next day, a bright red national flag with five golden stars fluttered on the rooftop of the broadcast station. When people were working in the fields, they looked at this fluttering red flag and worked even harder and more joyfully!

　　大喜事传到了农村
    晋县师范  陈惺铎
    在山西晋县的总十庄，这几天正赶着收秋，人们在地里收割，起五更下地，天擦黑才回来。傍晚是村上最热闹的时候，一车一车金黄的谷穗，拉进了村庄。吆喝着牲畜，唱着、喊着，这些充满愉快的声浪，使得村庄顿时活跃起来。直到吃晚饭的时候，人们才稍为安静下来。这时村里的屋顶广播却在清晰的喊起来了：
    “老乡们！喂！喂！老乡们！报告你们一件天大的喜事，这可是开天辟地头一遭哇！咱们的中华人民共和国中央人民政府，在北京成立啦，毛主席当选了中央人民政府的主席啦！”
    不等广播说完，人们一边吃饭，一边就互相谈开了：谈北京，谈毛主席。从城里回来的学生们，给人们解释着。
    “喂！喂！老乡们，几千年来，这回中国人民可完全站起来了！叫那些欺负我们的外国反动派滚蛋，叫那些地主恶霸规规矩矩，叫蒋介石反动派站在我们的面前打哆嗦吧！……”
    听的人都高兴地笑起来，不知不觉的放下饭碗，慢慢地从门口走到街头。人们都渐渐的向广播的屋顶下面集拢起来。
    “喂！喂！老乡们，在咱们政府成立的时候，咱们解放军的代表保证把反动派消灭干净；工人代表保证多干活；学生代表们保证把本领学好，为人民服务。咱们种地的，可不能落在别人后边呀！”
    挤满广播屋顶下面的人们，听到这里就更起劲的谈论起来：
    “那还用说，咱们种地的，一向就没落过后。”
    “现在有了地，种棉花、种花生，只要人民政府一声号召，保证生产的又多又好。”
    “有毛主席领导咱们，太行山也能搬到海里去。”
    老头子摸着胡须，说着当年地主统治的黑暗和罪恶，及搞斗争闹翻身的不容易。
    年青人互相交谈着新中国的建设。
    小孩子把谷穗编成的圈圈顶在头上，扭着到处乱跑。
    有些人憧憬着人民首都——北京的热闹场面。
    有些人到处找刚才广播的同志，想再问仔细些。
    第二天，在广播的屋顶上，飘出一面有五颗金星，鲜红的国旗。人们在田野里工作着的时候，望望这飘扬的红旗，工作得更勤奋更欢快了！
