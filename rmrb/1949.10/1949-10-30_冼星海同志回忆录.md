　　Comrade Xian Xinghai's Memoirs
    Guang Weiran

    It has been four years since Comrade Xinghai passed away. His death is truly an irreplaceable loss to us! Every time his memorial day comes, I always want to write something to commemorate him, and friends also encourage me to do so; but I have never been able to fulfill this wish. What can I do? Whenever I pick up the pen, I always feel the penholder is too heavy.

    I cannot write lyrics. What I wrote in the past was often just a pile of conceptual language, rough and uninteresting things that should have been forgotten long ago. The songs I collaborated on with Comrade Xinghai should not occupy any important position in his rich and colorful song legacy. But for me, the process of collaborating with Comrade Xinghai was almost the process of learning to write lyrics. Because before that, I had only written two or three songs such as "The Flowers of May"; and since parting with Comrade Xinghai in Yan'an, I have hardly written any lyrics in the past ten years. The reason why I wrote some unsightly things in the past was mainly due to the encouragement and urging of Comrade Xinghai.

    In June 1937, on the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, in the days of impending trouble, "The Flowers of May" spread to Shanghai, and young people sang it loudly to vent their anger. Comrades Xinghai, Zhang Shu, and others led the national salvation singing movement in Shanghai and vigorously promoted this song, so that along with its spread, romantic legends about the birth of this song circulated among the masses. At a singing trip and practice session in the suburbs of Shanghai, I met Comrades Xinghai and Zhang Shu. I was deeply moved by their tireless command and teaching of this song, sweating profusely all day. The next afternoon, I was invited to Xinghai's residence for a chat. He generally introduced me to his experience of traveling in Europe, his ambitions after returning to China, and his complaints at the time, and tirelessly explained the first draft of his "National Symphony." This conversation left a deep impression on me. In my mind, there was a stalwart figure, a bronze-colored face, a resolute expression of a challenger, and a creative greed that seemed to devour everything. In short, it was a vague image of a giant. I felt that, due to his unparalleled frankness, I had been conquered emotionally and in terms of personality. Therefore, when he asked me to write a memorial lyric for Gorky's anniversary when we parted, I readily agreed and handed it to him the next day. This was the first song we collaborated on. After he wrote it, he repeatedly hummed it and asked for opinions, until I also sang along and declared that I was completely satisfied. He immediately went to the singing team to teach it, and rushed to Nanjing on the eve of the memorial service to teach it himself. This person has such a tireless work ethic that makes you feel that he is a physically and mentally strong, energetic hero, and you would never think that the internal organs of this giant's body, due to a long life of poverty and wandering, left behind some embarrassing illnesses; this pain, others could not see, and he himself completely despised, finally forced him to stop his creative life of inspiration.

    When the "July 7th" and "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War broke out, how excited friends were. I and my comrades organized a frontline service group, and Xinghai also gladly participated. The matter was obstructed and did not succeed. In October, we arrived in Wuhan one after another. As soon as Comrade Xinghai arrived in Hankou, he was immediately surrounded by young people. He lived in the arms of young people, as comfortable as a child and as excited as a child. He went everywhere to teach singing, conduct, and discuss issues every day, and the room was always crowded. At this time, we collaborated on several more songs, mostly the excited cries of the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, such as "New China," praising and singing without reservation, optimistically believing that New China was born from now on, everything would be bright and beautiful, and everything would be fine.

    That winter, I returned to northern Hubei due to some matters. I passed through Anlu, where Comrade Xinghai was working in Anlu with the Second National Salvation Drama Troupe led by Mr. Hong Shen. I was left to stay in the team for a short period. I became familiar with the comrades of the Second Troupe, and we talked about ancient and modern times every day. When we were in high spirits, we collaborated with Xinghai to write songs. I don't remember what we wrote; it seems there were "Dramatic Resistance" and interludes in the script, and even some playful works. Xinghai was also in high spirits, writing music for every lyric. He often leaned over the corner of the chair and finished it in five minutes, and the whole team sang it in an instant. Comrade Xinghai has such ability: his vocabulary is rich, his musical thoughts spring up, his style is diverse, and he has his own unique style; and he is not afraid of noise, leaning over the corner of a chair, on the lid of a box, sitting on the threshold, he can write anytime and anywhere; and without hesitation, he can complete it in one go. The things written in this way are sometimes a bit rough and casual, but there are often masterpieces, revealing the brilliance of genius. Compared with those writers who "do not sing until they sing, and are amazing when they sing," and finally have to "not sing until they sing," we welcome Xinghai's working spirit even more, and thank him for creating rich food for the masses.

    In the spring of 1938, the Third Department of the Political Department was established, and progressive cultural figures gathered together. We worked together in the Art Propaganda Department led by Mr. Tian Han. Comrades Xinghai and Zhang Shu were still busy leading the singing activities of workers and students, and were extremely busy every day. And due to the stimulation of large-scale mass singing activities, Comrade Xinghai's creative output was also richer than at any time in the past, and many of them are immortal works. Mr. Tian Han, Mr. Chang Renxia and others provided him with very good lyrics. We also collaborated on no less than a dozen songs during this period, but most of them were impromptu pieces, such as memorial songs, songs promoting the program of resisting Japan and building the country, and even "Defending Great Wuhan." They were strongly time-sensitive and were sung and then discarded; and mainly because these lyrics were written very badly, they were not enough to inspire the composer's musical thoughts. As time passed, even the authors themselves abandoned them like worn-out shoes.

    The last time I met and collaborated with Comrade Xinghai was in Yan'an in the spring of 1939, when we wrote the "Yellow River Cantata." At that time, I was injured in a fall from a horse in the guerrilla area of ​​western Shanxi and went to Yan'an for treatment. Comrades from the Anti-Enemy Drama Troupe accompanied me to Yan'an. The comrades of the Third Troupe needed new performance programs, and Comrade Xinghai also proposed another collaboration and urged us to do so. I then rewrote my feelings and inspirations from crossing the Yellow River twice and marching along the Yellow River, which I originally wanted to write as a poem, into the lyrics of a large chorus. Lying in bed, I dictated it to a friend who recorded it, and after five days, I invited Comrade Xinghai that night and held a small recitation, reading it to him and all the comrades of the team, and telling him the motivation and intention of the writing as a reference. After he listened intently, he suddenly stood up and grabbed the lyrics in his hand and said, "I am confident that I can write it well!" Everyone applauded and cheered warmly, and our excitement and gratitude were beyond words.

    At that time, it was the climax of the first production campaign in Yan'an, and Comrade Xinghai also went to the mountains with the teachers and students of Lu Yi to reclaim wasteland every day, and his hands were also blistered. At this time, the campaign had come to an end, and he had ample time to rush to write in his small cave dwelling day and night. I still remember the row of small cave dwellings on that hillside, the dormitories of the Lu Yi teachers. Xinghai's room was simple and bright, with a wooden bed on the earthen bed, where he and his wife, Comrade Qian Yunling, lived together. The desk was by the window, also on the bed. Xinghai wrote his famous two large choruses and many other masterpieces on this small desk. His working perseverance is amazing, and he is unwilling to rest once he starts writing. Occasionally, he would lie on the small bed and ponder for a while, and then suddenly get up and write straight down. It seems that there is an endless source of musical words in his mind, gushing out, which makes him often in a state of excitement that cannot be suppressed. He doesn't smoke, but loves to eat sweets. He uses sweets instead of cigarettes when writing. He asked me to buy two pounds of white sugar and send it to him, because he couldn't buy sweets in Yan'an. A large bag of sugar powder was placed on the table, and he grabbed a handful and put it in his mouth after writing a few sentences; and in a blink of an eye, the sugar water turned into beautiful musical phrases.

    The performance date was approaching, and on the one hand we urged him to write quickly, and on the other hand we worried about his health; because he was staying up all night continuously. Every morning, we sent Comrade Tian Chong to carefully inquire about his achievements last night. He would never let us down and would bring back a new song when he returned. He was so modest that he must care about my opinion on each song, and generously authorized us: "You can change it as you like." Naturally, we would not be so arrogant. For the songs I like the most, such as "Yellow River Boatman's Song," "Defend the Yellow River," and "Roar, Yellow River," I felt that its momentum was magnificent and much greater than we expected, so I immediately handed it over to the whole team to practice. For other songs, sometimes we would make individual suggestions, and he would often revise them without hesitation. For example, for the two solo songs "Ode to the Yellow River" and "Yellow River Complaint," we were more critical, and he immediately overturned them all, and sent new drafts the next day. We were still dissatisfied with the second draft of "Ode to the Yellow River" and suggested that individual places should be revised. Who knew that he would tear it up and rewrite it again, and the third draft sent the next day was completely different from the second draft. I am very ignorant of music, what accurate and appropriate opinions can I put forward? Comrade Xinghai's trust in friends still makes me feel honored and grateful. For example, the various song forms of the chorus, such as which song to use solo or unison, dialogue singing, round singing, chorus, etc., were originally prescribed by me based on the subjectivity of a layman. Comrade Xinghai also completely accommodated and did not raise any objections. His creative talent can overcome any formal constraints and adapt to any difficult environment. As a great artist, he can also stretch his imagination to overcome the lack of his own life experience. For example, when he wrote the "Yellow River Cantata," he had never been to the Yellow River himself. Based on the inspiration of the lyrics and the simplest and most primitive record of the boatman's labor rhythm and artistic conception that we gave him, the "Boatman's Song" he wrote can give people such a warm and realistic feeling. This is genius, which is difficult for ordinary people to achieve. What's more, he had the experience of wandering in famous mountains and seas in the past; what's more, his creative life itself is a Yellow River water with a turbulent and continuous momentum!

    Comrade Xinghai completed the "Yellow River Cantata" with two weeks of day and night attacks, together with all the accompaniment written to adapt to the conditions of the Yan'an band at that time. A week later, with the assistance of the Music Department of Lu Yi, the Anti-Enemy Drama Troupe performed it in the auditorium of Shanxi Public School. I believe that this performance has always been the best performance of this chorus that I have ever heard. Although the choir was less than thirty people, and the band was only about thirty people, although the singing technique was very poor, everyone had rich life experience and full enthusiasm, and had fought on the banks of the Yellow River; they were familiar with the creative process, so they were good at conveying the creative intention; more importantly, this performance was under the direct guidance and direct leadership of Comrade Xinghai.

    The honor of the "Yellow River Cantata" is mainly the honor of Comrade Xinghai, and I have no qualifications to share its merits. This is because the writing of the lyrics was very hasty. Many places are vulgar clichés, many places are stiff and literal, and in many places, the ideological content is very low, and even vulgar. Only one thing hit Xinghai's intention, that is, there is a bit of so-called "momentum." The composer obtained this vulgar basis, stretched his genius imagination, and once rendered, he actually turned decay into magic. If I were to share its glory because of this, it would be too unfair.

    Comrade Xinghai is undoubtedly the greatest composer in our country and a people's artist. He loved the masses and labor so much, and his heart was close to the people, which gave him unparalleled strength and momentum, and made him live forever in the mouths and hearts of the people. His songs are the product of national spirit. He accurately expressed the spirit of the era before the victory of the people's great revolution, heroic and colorful and courageous in creation. He died too early. He has made the greatest and best efforts for the people he loves. The Chinese people will always thank him with tears in their eyes.

　　冼星海同志回忆录
    光未然
    星海同志逝世已经四周年了。他的死，对我们确是无可补偿的损失！每逢他的祭日，总想写点东西纪念他，朋友们也鼓励我这样做；可是一直未能如愿。有什么办法呢？提起笔来，老觉得笔杆太沉重了。
    我不会写歌词。过去写的，往往是些概念的语言的堆积，粗糙乏味的东西，早该被遗忘的。我和星海同志合作的歌曲，在他丰富多采的歌曲遗产中，不应占任何重要的地位。可是对我来说，和星海同志合作的过程，也几乎就是我学写歌词的过程。因为在这以前，我不过写了“五月的鲜花”等两三支歌子；而自从在延安和星海同志分手以后，十年来几乎不曾写过任何歌词了。过去写了些不成样的东西，主要是由于星海同志的鼓励和督促。
    一九三七年六月，抗战前夕，密云不雨的日子，“五月的鲜花”流传到上海，青年们大唱特唱，借此泄愤。星海、张曙等同志领导上海的救亡歌咏运动，极力传播这支歌曲，以至于伴随着它的流传，在群众中流行着关于这歌曲诞生经过的浪漫传说。在上海郊外的一次歌咏旅行和练唱会上，我结识了星海同志和张曙同志。对于他俩当天汗流浃背反复不倦地指挥和教唱这支歌曲，我深受感动。第二天下午，我便被邀到星海的寓所去聊天。他大体向我介绍了他的游欧经历，归国后的抱负和当时的牢骚，不惮烦地解释他的“民族交响乐”的初稿。这次的谈话，给我的印象很深。在我的头脑里，有了一个魁梧的身躯，紫铜色的面孔，坚毅的挑战者的表情，和仿佛要吞噬一切的，创造的贪恣，总之，是一幅模糊的巨人的形象。我感觉，由于他无比的坦白，在情感上和性格上，我已被征服了。因之当临别时，他提出要求，说高尔基周年祭辰迫近，要我写一首纪念歌词时，我便欣然应命，第二天就交给他了。这是我们合作的第一支歌曲。他写好以后，反复地哼着征询意见，直到我也跟着唱了，并声明完全满意为止。他立刻到歌咏队教唱，并在纪念会前夕赶到南京去亲自教唱。这个人，就是有这样一种永不知疲倦的工作精神，使你感到他是身心俱强朝气蓬勃的英雄，而完全想不到这个巨人的身体内部机构，由于长期的穷苦流浪的生活，遗留下一些难堪的病痛；这病痛，别人看不出来，他自己也完全藐视的，最后终于强制他停止了才思迸发的创作生命。
    “七、七”“八、一三”抗战爆发，朋友们是多么兴奋啊。我和同志们组织了一个战地服务的团体，星海也欣然参加。其事受阻未成，十月间，我们先后到了武汉。星海同志一到汉口，立刻被青年人所包围。他生活在青年人的怀抱里，象孩子一样地安适，又象孩子一样地兴奋。每天四处去教唱，指挥，谈问题，房里总是挤得满满地。我们这时又合作了几支歌曲，大抵是抗战初期的兴奋的叫嚣，如“新中国”之类，居然赞美歌颂，无保留地乐观，以为新中国从此诞生，一切都会光明美好，万事大吉了。
    是年冬，我因事回鄂北，路过安陆，适星海同志随洪深先生领导的救亡演剧第二队在安陆工作，我被留下在该队小驻。我和二队同志混熟了，每天上下古今，乱谈一阵，兴来时便与星海合作写歌。写了些什么，记不得了；好象有“戏剧抗战”及剧本里面的插曲，甚至还有些游戏之作。星海也是兴致大发，有词必谱，往往俯在椅角，五分钟一挥而就，刹那间全队传唱起来。星海同志有这样的本事：他的语汇丰富，乐思泉涌，风格多样，自成异采；而能不怕吵闹，俯在椅角上，箱盖上，坐在门槛上，随时随地可以写作；且不假思索，一气呵成。这样写出来的东西，有时不免粗糙一些，随便一些，而时有佳作，吐露天才的毫光。较之那些“不鸣则已、一鸣惊人”而终于只好“不鸣则已”了的作家们，我们更欢迎星海这样的工作精神，感谢他为群众创造了丰富的食粮。
    一九三八年春，政治部第三厅成立，进步的文化人大汇合。我们同在田汉先生领导的艺术宣传处工作。星海、张曙同志们仍然忙于领导工人和学生的歌咏活动，每天忙得不亦乐乎。而由于大规模群众歌咏活动的刺激，星海同志的创作量也较过去任何时期为丰富，其中有许多是不朽之作。田汉先生，常任侠先生等供给了他很好的词。我们这一时期合作的歌曲也不下十余首，但多是些应时急就之章，如纪念歌、宣传抗战建国纲领的歌直到“保卫大武汉”之类，时间性强，唱过便了；而主要是由于这些歌词写得很坏，不足启发作曲者的乐思，事过境迁，连作者自己也就弃如敝屣了。
    我和星海同志最后一次见面和合作，是在一九三九年春天的延安，写出了“黄河大合唱”。那时我在晋西游击区坠马受伤，到延安诊治，抗敌演剧第三队的同志们伴送我到延安。三队同志需要新的演出节目，星海同志也提议再来一次合作，催之不已。我便把两次渡黄河及在黄河边上行军时的感兴，本来要写一首诗的，改写成大合唱的歌词。躺在病床上，口授友人笔录，五天写就后，当天晚上请来了星海同志，开了个小小的朗诵会，念给他和全队同志听，并把写作的动机和意图谈给他作为参考。他凝神听完之后，忽地站起来把歌词一把抓在手里，说：“我有把握把它写好！”大家热烈地鼓掌欢呼，我们的兴奋和感激是不言可喻了。
    那时正是延安第一次生产运动的高潮，星海同志也每天随鲁艺师生上山开荒，手上也打了泡的。这时运动已告一段落，他有了充裕的时间，在他的小窑洞里，日以继夜地赶写起来。我还记得那山坡上一排的小窑洞，鲁艺教师们的宿舍。星海的一间朴素而开朗，土炕上架着木床，他和夫人钱韵玲同志同住，临窗是书桌，也架在炕上，星海就在这小桌上写出了他有名的两个大合唱及其他许多佳作。他的工作毅力是惊人的，一开始写作就不愿休息。偶而斜躺在小床上抱头沉吟一下，忽地又起来振笔直书下去。他的头脑里仿佛有无尽的乐语的泉源，刷刷地迸流出来，就使他经常处在一种兴奋的无法自抑的精神状态中。他不抽烟，爱吃糖，写作时以糖果代烟。延安买不着糖果，他要我买两斤白糖送给他。大包的糖末放在桌上，写几句便抓一把送到嘴里；于是一转瞬间，糖水便化而为美妙的乐句了。
    演出的日子迫近了，我们一方面催着他快写，一方面又耽心他的身体；因为他在连续的熬夜。每天早上，我们派田冲同志去小心地探问他昨夜的成果，他永不会让我们失望，回来时便带来一支新曲。他是那样地虚心，一定要关心我对每一支曲子的意见，并且豪爽地授权给我们：“可以随便地改。”自然，我们不会那样狂妄的。象我所最喜欢的曲子，如“黄河船夫曲”“保卫黄河”“怒吼吧黄河”等，感到它的气势磅礴，比我们料想的要伟大得多，便马上交给全队练唱。其他的曲子，有时我们提出个别的意见，他往往毫不迟疑地修改，象“黄河颂”，“黄河怨”两个独唱曲，我们挑剔得较多，他立即全部推翻，第二天又送来了新稿。第二稿的“黄河颂”我们还有不满意处，提出希望修改个别的某某地方，哪知他又撕掉重写，第三天送来的，又和第二稿面貌全非了。我对音乐很无知，能提出什么精确恰当的意见呢？星海同志对于朋友的信赖，至今尤使我感到光荣和感激。象大合唱的各种曲式，如哪一歌曲用独唱或齐唱，对唱，轮唱，合唱等原是我凭着外行人的主观擅自规订的，星海同志也完全迁就，未提出任何意见。他的创造的才能，可以克服任何形式的拘限，可以适应任何困难的环境。作为一个大艺术家，他还能伸展自己的想象力以克服自己生活体验之不足。譬如他写“黄河大合唱”的时候，自己并未到过黄河，凭着歌词的启发和我们交给他的一点最简单原始的船夫劳动节奏与意境的纪录，他写出的“船夫曲”竟能给人以那样热烈的逼真的感觉。这就是天才，通常人难以做到的。何况他以往究竟有着名山与海洋漫游的经历；何况他的创作生命的本身，就是一条气势澎湃奔腾不息的黄河水！
    星海同志以两星期的日夜突击，写完了“黄河大合唱”，连同适应当时延安乐队的条件所写出的全部伴奏，再一周后，在鲁艺音乐系的协助之下，由抗敌演剧第三队上演于陕公大礼堂。我以为，这次的演唱，始终是我所听到过的这个大合唱的最好的一次演唱。虽然合唱队不到三十人，乐队也不过三十人左右，虽然演唱的技术是很差的，但大家有丰富的生活体验和饱满的热情，曾经在黄河边上战斗过来的；他们熟悉创作的过程，故善于传达创作的意图；更重要的，这次演出，是在星海同志直接教导和直接主持之下的。
    “黄河大合唱”的荣誉，主要是星海同志的荣誉，我没有任何资格分与其功。这由于歌词的写作是非常草率的，许多地方是粗俗的滥调，许多地方是生硬的咬文嚼字，许多地方，思想性是很低的，甚而是庸俗的。只有一点中了星海的意，就是有一点所谓“气魄”。作曲家得到这一点粗俗的凭借，伸展他天才的奇想，于是一经渲染，居然化腐臭为神奇。倘我竟因此而分与其荣，就未免太不公平了。
    星海同志无疑地是我国最伟大的作曲家，人民的艺术家。他那样热爱群众，热爱劳动，他的心贴近人民，这就给他以无比的力量和气魄，并使他永远活在人民的嘴上，心上。他的歌曲，是民族气派的产物，他准确地表现了人民大革命胜利前夜的时代精神，豪强多采而勇于创造。他死得太早，他已经为他所热爱的人民尽了最大最好的努力。中国人民将永远含着眼泪感激他。
    （十月二十九日）
