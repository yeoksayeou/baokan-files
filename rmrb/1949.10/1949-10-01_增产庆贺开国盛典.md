Increasing Production to Celebrate the Founding Ceremony
    Wang Shiqi, Coal Carrier, Mentougou

　　Today, around two o'clock in the afternoon, when I was carrying my second load of coal from the mine, I saw the weighing clerk holding a copy of the People's Daily. On the upper corner of the front page was a picture of Chairman Mao. I knew that our Chairman Mao was about to publish another revolutionary document like "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." I stretched my head to look and saw the headline I had been waiting for every day: "Opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!" My heart leaped with joy, and I shouted, "This is great!" I was so happy that I forgot the coal on my back. With a jump and a straightened back, I spilled a pound of coal on the scale. After dumping the coal, I wanted to look at the newspaper again, but it had already been snatched away. Walking towards the mine, I thought that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, this day had finally come. The truly People's Political Consultative Conference had opened, and a new People's Republic was about to be born. I imagined the future of a strong and beautiful New China and the eternal happiness of the people. I felt refreshed by the happy event. Carrying coal up and down felt especially light. I must carry a few more loads today to celebrate the birth of our New China and earn the money to buy the newspapers, which must be full of important and valuable news these days.
    When I mentioned these ideas to my companions, there was a burst of enthusiastic shouts and unanimous responses. Old Li, while using his pickaxe to mine coal, said, "That's right, what Old Wang said is right. This is practically the birthday of the Chinese people. We must celebrate it. Everyone should carry a few more loads today. I can't read, so I'll have a couple of drinks when I get back, but Old Wang has to read the newspaper to us tonight." Amid joyful laughter, this group produced an extra two tons of coal. Good, we will celebrate this unprecedented grand ceremony with increased production.

　　增产庆贺开国盛典
    门头沟背煤工人  王士琦
    今天下午两点多钟，在窑下背上第二回煤来的时候，看见看磅的先生，拿着一张人民日报，在首页的上角，载着毛主席的像片，我知道我们的毛主席，又有象“论人民民主专政”一样的革命文谳在发表了，伸过脑袋去一看，竟是每天盼望的“中国人民政治协商会议开幕”的标题！心里一乐，两腿一蹦，喊了一声“这可好了！”净顾高兴啦，忘了身上背着的煤了，一蹦腿，一直腰，把煤洒了一磅板，倒完煤回来，再想看那张报，可早被人抢走了。向窑下走着，心想在毛主席的领导下，终于有了这一天，真的人民政协开幕了，新的人民共和国就要诞生了，心里憧憬着强大美丽的新中国的将来，与人民永远的幸福，真是人逢喜事精神爽，背煤上下，特别的轻快，今天得多背几回，用增加生产来庆祝我们新中国的诞生，并且这两天报上，重大宝贵的新闻，一定不少，更得把这买报的钱先挣出来。
    把我这些意见，跟同伴们一提，一阵热烈的呼喊，齐声响应，老李一边用镐招着煤，一边说，“对，老王说的对，这简直是我们中国人民的生日，是得贺一下，今天全都多背几回，我不识字，回去得喝两盅，可是老王晚上得给我们念报去。”在愉快的欢笑中，这一拨子，多出了两吨煤。好的，我们就以增产来庆贺这个空前盛典。
