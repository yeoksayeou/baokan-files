　　Simonov and Others Give Speech at Tsinghua
　　Calling for Dedication of Wisdom and Knowledge to the People's Cause, Pointing out that Soviet Scientists Will Do Their Best to Help China
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th] Simonov, deputy head of the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation, along with scientist Agraz and agricultural scientist Stoletev, addressed over 10,000 students and faculty members from the North China People's Revolutionary University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University this afternoon at the invitation of the three schools. The lecture was held on the Tsinghua University playground. When the Soviet representatives entered the venue, all the students and faculty members welcomed them with fervent applause and cheers. After Ye Qisun, Chairman of the Tsinghua University Affairs Committee, and Wu Han, a professor at Tsinghua University, delivered welcome speeches, the entire audience stood and sang the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union. The first speaker was Simonov, who said: The young people currently studying at China's highest institutions of learning have truly unlimited and broad prospects ahead of them. There is now nothing to prevent you from advancing and fulfilling your glorious mission of serving the people. This glorious mission is also before the young people and students of higher institutions in the Soviet Union. This task of serving the people unites Soviet and Chinese students, enabling them to easily achieve complete mutual understanding. The second speaker was Agraz, who said: Eleven years ago, Stalin said something when receiving workers from Soviet advanced specialized schools, that in order to achieve true scientific prosperity, scientists must have the idea of serving the people and must be prepared to contribute all the fruits of science to the people. Stalin's words have become the banner of Soviet scientists. The young students and scholars in China now face, just as the Soviet youth did after the October Revolution, great opportunities to contribute their abilities and wisdom to the cause of the people. Agricultural scientist Stoletev said in his speech: Soviet scientists are prepared to do everything in their power to help Chinese scientists and Chinese university students develop science, which will be the most powerful assistant in the construction of the new people's democratic China. Soviet agricultural scientists are also prepared to do their utmost to help Chinese agricultural scientists in all aspects to improve China's agricultural technology, prevent floods and droughts, and create more productive crops and livestock. After the lectures, representatives from the three universities went on stage to present flowers and gifts to the delegation, and slogans such as "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship" and "Long live Stalin" rose one after another. Finally, the delegation's art performance team performed dances and other recreational programs for all the teachers and students of the three schools. Today is the seventh day of the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation's arrival in Beijing. In the morning, the entire delegation visited the Summer Palace. In the evening, the delegation's art performance team performed wonderful programs to entertain the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

　　西蒙诺夫等在清华演说
    号召把智慧与知识献给人民事业指出苏联科学家将尽力帮助中国
    【新华社北京七日电】苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团副团长西蒙诺夫、代表科学家阿格拉则、农业学家斯托列托夫，今日下午应华北人民革命大学、清华大学和燕京大学三个学校的邀请，向一万多学生和教职员讲演。讲演大会是在清华大学操场举行。当苏联代表们进入会场时，全体学生和教职员用狂热的鼓掌和欢呼来欢迎他们。清华大学校务委员会主任叶企孙、清华大学教授吴晗致欢迎词后，全场起立高唱中苏两国国歌。第一个讲演的是西蒙诺夫，他说：摆在现在就学于中国最高学府的青年人们的面前，有着真正无限远大的前途。现在已没有任何东西阻止你们的前进和你们为人民服务的光荣任务。这个光荣任务同样摆在苏联青年人们和最高学府学生的面前。这个为人民服务的任务把苏联学生和中国学生联合在一起，使他们能够容易地达到完全的互相谅解。第二个讲演的是阿格拉则，他说：十一年前斯大林曾在招待苏联高级专门学校工作者时说过一句话，即是要达到真正的科学繁荣，科学家必须具备为人民服务的思想，必须准备把科学的一切成果贡献给人民。斯大林的这句话成为了苏联科学家的旗帜。现在摆在中国青年学、生、学者面前的，正如十月革命以后摆在苏联青年面前的一样，有了很大的机会，可以把自己的能力和智慧贡献给人民的事业。农业学家斯托列托夫在讲演中说：苏联科学家准备尽一切力量帮助中国科学家，帮助中国大学生来发展科学，这样的科学，对新的人民民主中国的建设将是最有力的助手。苏联的农业学家同样地也准备尽最大力量从各方面帮助中国的农业学家，来提高中国的农业技术，防止水旱灾害，创造生产率更高的农作物和家畜。讲演后，三个大学的代表纷纷登台向代表团献花献礼，“中苏友好万岁”、“斯大林万岁”等口号此落彼起。最后代表团的艺术演出队向三校全体师生表演舞蹈等游艺节目。今天是苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团到达北京的第七日，全体代表在上午曾赴颐和园游历。晚间，代表团的艺术演出队演出精彩节目，招待中国人民解放军。
