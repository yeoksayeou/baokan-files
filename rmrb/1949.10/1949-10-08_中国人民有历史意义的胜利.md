Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 6th: TASS, Moscow reports: The Pravda published an editorial on the 5th entitled "The Chinese People Have a Historically Significant Victory," stating:

	The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, convened in Beijing, announced the establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1st, thereby expressing the will of all ethnic groups in China. The organs of power of the People's Republic of China have been formed, and the Central People's Government has been established, headed by Mao Zedong, the glorious son of the Chinese people and the long-tested leader of the Chinese Communist Party.

	The proclamation of the establishment of the People's Republic of China is a prominent and historically significant event. A new and glorious page has been opened in the lives of four hundred and seventy-five million great people. The long and steadfast struggle of the Chinese democratic forces against the combined forces of domestic reactionaries and international imperialism has achieved a victorious result. The broadest masses of the Chinese people, led by the working class and its fighting vanguard, the Communist Party, and supported by the powerful socialist and democratic camp, have overthrown the utterly corrupt and reactionary Kuomintang regime—an anti-national regime of feudal oppression and colonial exploitation.

	Thus, Chinese democracy has won national independence for its country, ending the long period of more than a century of predatory foreign capital conquering and enslaving China. The victory of Chinese democracy is also the defeat of the dark and reactionary forces within China, which, like a huge octopus, strangled the Chinese people, hindered the progressive economic and cultural development of China, and served as a pillar for the enslavement of the Chinese people by American, British, and Japanese imperialists.

	Now, China is purging the people's ferocious enemies. The majority of the Chinese people have been liberated from the shackles of imperialism and feudalism. Major cultural and industrial centers, major ports, and railway trunk lines have been cleared of the enemy. North China, Central China, and considerable areas of South China have been completely liberated. The People's Liberation Army is advancing towards Guangzhou, the last major port still in the hands of the Kuomintang.

	In the liberated areas of China, the masses of the people are filled with creative and constructive enthusiasm, reorganizing social relations under the leadership of the Communist Party. The masses of the Chinese people are deeply convinced that the fate of the country cannot be entrusted to reactionary rulers who pursue selfish and anti-people goals. The Chinese people are taking power into their own hands, destroying the reactionary Kuomintang regime, and laying the foundations for a people's democratic state. This state is led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and unites all democratic classes and all minority nationalities in China.

	The alliance of the working class and the broad peasantry is strengthening. The Chinese working class maintains its glorious revolutionary traditions, leading millions of peasants in the common struggle for the democratic transformation and renovation of China. The land reform implemented in several liberated areas (Northeast, North China) has destroyed the foundation of feudal land ownership. The land of landlords and traitors has been confiscated and distributed to landless and land-poor peasants. In the past two years, more than one hundred million Chinese peasants have obtained land. For the first time, Chinese peasants, who had been oppressed by feudal landlords for centuries, have begun to cultivate their land without having to rent it under conditions of servitude or pay heavily exploited interest.

	Industrial, agricultural, and other enterprises belonging to the reactionary Kuomintang leaders and Chinese capitalist tycoons who have close ties with foreign capital are being nationalized. Railways, factories, and mines are being successfully restored. A state-owned economic sector that serves the interests of the people is being established and will play a leading role in the national economy of democratic China.

	The state has begun to implement large-scale measures aimed at improving the material and cultural welfare of urban and rural working people. Workers, peasants, and intellectual youth will be given priority in access to schools and universities.

	The victory of Chinese democracy was prepared by the entire course of historical development.

	The Great October Socialist Revolution marked a radical turning point in the history of mankind, damaging the rule of imperialism in colonies and dependent countries, awakening the oppressed masses of the East, and opening a new page in their liberation struggles. Similarly, it led Chinese history onto a new stage. The inextinguishable flame of the great ideas of Lenin and Stalin has ignited the hearts of millions of Chinese people. The existence of the socialist Soviet Union, which borders China, its vigorous development, its revolutionary experience, and its fraternal solidarity, have illuminated and inspired the struggle of the Chinese working people against imperialism and feudalism.

	The great geniuses of mankind, Lenin and Stalin, foresaw the inevitable upsurge of the Chinese revolution. The theory they developed, that of carrying out colonial national revolutions under the leadership of the working class and under the banner of internationalism in the age of imperialism, has become a treasure of Marxist-Leninist theory. Comrade Stalin made the most profound and scientific analysis of the nature, characteristics, and prerequisites for the victory of the Chinese anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution. Guided by the scientific theory of communism, the Chinese Communist Party has been the main force in the struggle for national independence and for the victory of Chinese democracy.

	The Chinese people's historically significant victory demonstrates the all-conquering power of Marxist-Leninist theory.

	The most important precursor to the political and military victory of Chinese democracy was the defeat of Germany and Japan in World War II, the collapse of fascism in which the great Soviet Union played a decisive role. The collapse of the German and Japanese war machines, the growth of democratic forces throughout the world, and the weakening of the imperialist camp—these were all factors that contributed to the unprecedented development of the Chinese people's national liberation struggle and the achievement of historically significant victories, because they immobilized the forces of international imperialism. Mao Zedong wrote in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "If there were no Soviet Union, if there were no victory in the anti-fascist Second World War, if there were no defeat of Japanese imperialism (which is particularly important to us), if there were no emergence of various new democratic countries... then the international reactionary forces piled on our heads would certainly be many times greater than they are now. Under these circumstances, could we have been victorious? Obviously not."

	The glorious Chinese Communist Party is the inspirer and organizer of the national liberation struggle and the historically significant victory won by the Chinese people.

	During the years of the Second World War, the self-serving Kuomintang rulers, who were shirking the people's war against the imperialist occupiers, advocated a strategy of "passive resistance" against the enemy—a strategy often used to cover up direct collusion with the Japanese aggressors. Only the Chinese Communist Party, from the beginning, took it upon itself to organize the armed struggle of the whole nation against the Japanese imperialists. The Chinese Communists have proved to be reliable, brave, and self-sacrificing fighters for the glory, freedom, and independence of their country.

	After the Second World War, the Kuomintang leadership, which represented the interests of all reactionary forces hated and rejected by the people, completely merged with the American ruling clique. The American ruling clique attempted to replace their defeated opponents and competitors—Japanese imperialism—in China. The clouds of a new war had barely cleared from above China, when they began to gather once again. Greedy American monopoly capitalists planned to turn China into a colony deprived of all rights. With the help of despicable Kuomintang lackeys, they attempted to suffocate China's democratic forces and attempted to once again plunge the masses of the Chinese people into the fate of semi-starved, impoverished slaves. After the war ended, American troops had already entered China, ostensibly to disarm the surrendered Japanese forces. The American ruling clique spent tens of billions of dollars to arm the suppression of the Chinese people's liberation movement, to enslave the Chinese people. American imperialists gave the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government financial and other economic aid, armed and modernized the Kuomintang army, controlled the Kuomintang's military headquarters, intelligence agencies, and secret police, thus engaging in direct intervention in China.

	Just as during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese Communist Party united all patriots to fight for national independence and to prevent the new and terrible danger of enslavement by American capital.

	In more than three years of struggle, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Communist Party, crushed millions of Kuomintang troops armed with American weapons and equipped with American technology. The victory of Chinese democracy not only meant the defeat of the Kuomintang reactionaries, but also marked the collapse of America's greedy plans in China. American imperialism, which dreamed of turning China into its own colony and turning China into a springboard for new wars of aggression, has gone bankrupt!

	The Chinese people's historic victory is another most powerful blow to the entire system of imperialism, and another defeat for the camp of world reactionaries and warmongers. This victory has greatly strengthened the forces of the peace, democracy, and socialism front, headed by the great Soviet Union.

	China, with its hundreds of millions of people, is a member of the democratic and peace-loving family of nations. As proclaimed in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which has now become the constitution of the Chinese people: "The People's Republic of China unites with all peace-loving and free countries and nations in the world, especially with the Soviet Union, the people's democracies, and all oppressed nations, stands on the side of the international peace and democracy front, and jointly opposes imperialist aggression, in order to guarantee lasting peace in the world."

	The Chinese people have irrevocably taken control of their own destiny. Comrade Stalin's brilliant prediction has been realized. As early as 1925, he said: "In China, the forces of the revolutionary movement are enormous. They have not yet fully manifested themselves. But they will in the future. Those rulers in the East and West who do not see these forces and do not give them due consideration will suffer as a result... Here, truth and justice are entirely on the side of the Chinese revolution. That is why we now and will in the future sympathize with the Chinese revolution, which is carrying out the struggle to liberate the Chinese people from the shackles of imperialism and to unite China into one country. Whoever does not take this force into account now and in the future is bound to fail."

	Guided by the great Stalin, true to the immortal instructions of Lenin, the Soviet people have consistently held deep sympathy for the national liberation struggle of the Chinese people. Today, all the Soviet people hail with great joy the historically significant outcome of this long struggle—the founding of the People's Republic of China.

	Our people warmly support the Soviet government's note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China, which announced that the Soviet government, in its unwavering pursuit of maintaining friendly relations with the Chinese people and in its conviction that the Central People's Government of China represents the will of the vast majority of the Chinese people, has adopted the decision to establish friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

	The People's Republic of China faces enormous tasks—to completely complete the revolution, to completely eliminate the reactionary Kuomintang regime employed by others, to destroy imperialist and feudal serf oppression throughout China, to restore and develop China's economy, and to build a new, unified, independent, prosperous, and democratic China.

	The Soviet people most sincerely wish the young People's Republic of China great success in completing all these historic tasks.

	Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!

　　中国人民有历史意义的胜利
    【新华社北京六日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报五日以“中国人民有历史意义的胜利”为题，发表社论称：
    在北京召开的人民政治协商会议，于十月一日宣告中华人民共和国的成立，从而表示了全中国各族人民底意志。中华人民共和国权力机关业已组成，而且中央人民政府以中国人民光荣的儿子、中国共产党久经考验的领袖毛泽东为首而建立起来了。
    中华人民共和国的宣告成立，是一件突出的有历史意义的事件。四亿七千五百万伟大人民的生活中业已打开了新的光辉的一页。中国民主力量对国内反动派与国际帝国主义联合力量所进行的长期和坚毅的斗争已经得到了胜利结果。以工人阶级及其战斗的先锋队共产党为首的中国最广大的人民群众，从强大的社会主义与民主阵营取得支持，业已推翻了腐朽透顶的反动的国民党政权——封建压迫与殖民地剥削的反民族政权。
    从而中国民主主义已为其国家赢得了民族独立，结束了掠夺性的外国资本一世纪多以来征服与奴役中国的长久时期。中国民主主义的胜利，同时也就是中国国内黑暗反动势力的失败，这一反动势力曾象巨大的章鱼一样扼杀着中国人民，阻碍着中国进步的经济与文化的发展，并曾充当美、英、日帝国主义奴役者的支柱。
    现在，中国正在肃清人民的凶残敌人。大多数中国人民已经从帝国主义与封建主义的桎梏下解放出来。中国较大的文化与工业中心，主要港口和铁路干线都已肃清了敌人。华北、华中以及华南相当大的地区已完全解放了。人民解放军部队正在向广州——仍在国民党手里的最后一个大港口——前进。
    在中国解放了的地区，人民大众充满着创造性的、建设性的积极性，在共产党领导下改组着社会关系。中国的人民大众已经深信，国家的命运不能付托给奉行自私反人民的目的之反动统治者。中国人民正把权力掌握在自己手里，摧毁着反动的国民党政权，并为人民民主的国家奠立着基础。这一国家是以工人阶级为首，以工农联盟为基础，并团结中国所有的民主阶级和所有的少数民族的。
    工人阶级和广大农民的联盟正在增强着。中国工人阶级保持着其光荣的革命传统，领导着千百万农民群众进行着中国的民主改造与革新的共同斗争。若干解放了的地区（东北、华北）所实行的土地改革，已经推毁了封建土地所有制的基础。地主和汉奸的土地已被没收并分给无地和少地的农民。在过去两年的过程中，中国有一万万多农民得到了土地。许多世纪受着封建地主压迫的中国农民，第一次不用在奴役条件下租佃土地和不用支付重利盘剥的利息，开始了在他的土地上进行耕种。
    属于反动的国民党头子和与外国资本有密切关系的中国资产阶级大亨的工业、农业和其他企业，正被收归国有。铁路、工厂和矿山正胜利地恢复着。从属于人民利益的国营经济部分正在建立起来，并将在民主中国的国民经济中起领导作用。
    国家已开始实行旨在提高城乡劳动人民的物质和文化福利的大规模的措施。工人、农民和知识分子的青年将得到入学校与大学的优先权。
    中国民主主义的胜利，是由历史发展的全部过程所准备好的。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命标志着全世界人类历史上的彻底转捩，它损坏了殖民地与附属国家中帝国主义的统治，唤醒了东方被压迫的人民群众，揭开了他们的解放斗争的新的一页。同样的，它也把中国的历史导上了新阶段。列宁和斯大林伟大的思想的不能扑灭的火焰，燃着了中国千百万老百姓的心。毗邻中国的社会主义的苏联底存在，它的蓬勃发展，它的革命经验与兄弟般休戚与共的情谊，照亮并鼓舞了中国劳动人民反帝反封建的斗争。
    人类的伟大天才列宁与斯大林已预见到不可避免的中国革命的高涨。他们发展出来的、在帝国主义时代中在工人阶级领导下与国际主义旗帜之下进行殖民地民族革命的理论，已成为马列主义的珍宝的理论。斯大林同志曾对中国反帝反封建的革命之胜利的性质、特点与先决条件，作了最深入最科学的分析。受着共产主义的科学理论指导的中国共产党，已经是为民族独立，为中国人民民主主义的胜利而斗争的主力。
    中国人民的有历史意义的胜利，显示出马列主义理论的战胜一切的力量。
    中国民主主义的政治及军事胜利最重要的先导，是德国与日本在第二次世界大战中的失败，是伟大的苏维埃国度在其中起了决定性作用的法西斯主义的溃败。德国与日本战争机构的崩溃，全世界民主力量的成长及帝国主义阵营的削弱——这些都是有助于中国人民民族解放斗争的空前发展，和获得历史意义的胜利的因素，因为它们使国际帝国主义的力量动弹不得。毛泽东曾在“论人民民主专政”一文中写道：“假如没有苏联的存在，假如没有反法西斯的第二次世界大战的胜利，假如没有打倒日本帝国主义（这一点对我们特别重要），假如没有各新民主国家的出现………那么，堆在我们头上的国际反动势力必定比现在不知要大多少倍，在这种情形下，我们能够胜利么？显然是不能的。”
    光荣的中国共产党是民族解放斗争与中国人民所赢得的有历史意义的胜利的鼓舞者与组织者。
    在第二次世界大战的岁月中，对反对帝国主义占领者的人民战争怠工的唯利是图的国民党统治者主张对敌人采取“消极抵抗”的策略——经常用以掩盖直接与日本侵略者勾结的策略。只有中国共产党从开始就以组织全国反对日本帝国主义者的武装斗争自任。中国共产党人已证明是争取他们国家的光荣、自由与独立的可靠的勇敢的自我牺牲的斗士。
    在第二次世界大战以后，代表为人民所憎恨和唾弃的国内一切反动势力之利益的国民党领导机构，完全与美国统治集团合流了。美国统治集团企图在中国代替他们的败北的敌手和竞争者——日本帝国主义的地位。第二次世界大战几乎还没有结束，中国的上空就积聚了新的乌云。贪婪的美国垄断资本家们打算把中国变为一个被剥夺任何权利的殖民地。在可鄙的国民党走狗的帮助下，他们企图窒息中国的民主力量，并企图再度使中国人民大众陷于半饥饿的、贫苦的奴隶生活的命运。在战争结束以后，美国军队即已开抵中国，表面上是为的解除投降日军的武装。美国统治集团耗费了几十亿美元武装镇压中国的人民解放运动，奴役中国人民。美帝国主义者给予蒋介石反动政府以财政的和其他的经济援助，武装国民党军并使之现代化，控制国民党的军事总部、情报机关及秘密警察，这样实际上在中国从事了直接的干涉。
    正如在抗日战争期间的情形一样，中国共产党团结了所有爱国分子，为争取国家的独立和防止美国资本奴役的新的可怕的危险而斗争。
    在三年多的斗争中，中国人民解放军在共产党领导下粉碎了以美国武器武装起来的并以美国技术装备起来的数百万国民党军队。中国民主主义的胜利，不仅意味着国民党反动派的失败，而且表明着美国在华贪婪计划的崩溃。梦想把中国变为它自己的殖民地、把中国变为新的侵略战争的大跳板的美帝国主义是破产了！
    中国人民的历史性胜利是对帝国主义整个体系的又一个最有力的打击，是世界反动和战争贩子阵营的又一次失败。这个胜利大大地增强了以伟大苏联为首的和平、民主与社会主义阵线的力量。
    拥有数万万人口的中国是民主、爱好和平的国家大家庭中的一个成员。正如现在已成为中国人民宪章的中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领中所宣布的：“中华人民共和国联合世界上一切爱好和平、自由的国家和民族，首先是联合苏联、各人民民主国家和各被压迫民族，站在国际和平民主阵营方面，共同反对帝国主义侵略，以保障世界的持久和平。”
    中国人民已经无可改变地掌握了自己的命运。斯大林同志的天才预言实现了。早在一九二五年，他就说过：“在中国，革命运动的力量是巨大的。它们还没有充分表现出来。但它们将来会的。看不见这些力量以及不给它们以应有的估计的东方和西方的统治者们，将要因此吃苦头………这里，真理与正义是完全在中国革命一方面的。这就是为什么我们现在和将来都同情中国革命的缘故，这个革命正在进行着从帝国主义桎梏下解放中国人民以及统一中国为一个国家的斗争。谁在现在和将来不计算到这一力量，谁就一定要失败”。
    忠实于不朽列宁的指示为伟大斯大林所指导着的苏联人民，一贯地对中国人民大众的民族解放斗争抱深厚的同情。今天，全体苏联人民以极大的愉悦心情，欢呼这一长期斗争的具有历史意义的成果——中华人民共和国的成立。
    我们人民热烈拥护苏联政府致中国中央人民政府外交部的照会，这一照会宣布：苏联政府由于始终不渝地力求与中国人民保持友好关系，并确信中国中央人民政府代表着绝大多数中国人民的意志，采取了建立苏联与中华人民共和国间友好关系的决定。
    中华人民共和国面临着巨大的任务——全部完成革命，完全肃清受雇于人的国民党反动政权，在中国全境内摧毁帝国主义的与封建农奴制的压迫，恢复与发展中国的经济，建设新的统一、独立、繁荣、民主的中国。
    苏联人民至为虔诚地预祝年轻的中华人民共和国在完成这一切历史任务中获得伟大的成功。
    中华人民共和国万岁！中苏两国人民的友谊万岁！
