    Four, Watching the Play

    It is said that these four people arrived at the bottom of the opera stage. Tianlu went to seriously watch the play, and the Liugou family also watched the play while joking and playing with the men. However, Little Foreign Devil even forgot to watch the famous Shanxi Opera "Butterfly Cup" that was being performed on the stage. He pulled Da San to a grinding disc at the foot of the slope, sat down, and started gesticulating and talking. As for Da San, he originally didn't like watching plays, nor did he like the lively atmosphere. This time, he came partly to accompany his second brother, and partly because Little Foreign Devil had talked to him the most since he returned to the village. He slowly felt that Little Foreign Devil was not bad, even if he made such a friend, and was willing to talk to this friend. Therefore, he simply didn't think about watching the play, and only followed Little Foreign Devil's gestures and chattered along.

    Little Foreign Devil didn't say anything serious either. He just pointed at the crowd watching the play, telling Da San who was called what, and who was who. Da San didn't really know the people in the village, so he found it somewhat interesting, and sometimes he would interject a few words, pointing at a few people and asking. However, Da San only asked about the men, but Little Foreign Devil preferred to point at the women and tell Da San. At the southeast corner of the opera stage, there was a high-legged stool specially placed for watching the play, and a row of women were sitting on it, dressed in reds and florals, looking very pretty. Little Foreign Devil pointed at them and quietly told Da San that they were from the wealthy Zhang Jubao's family, saying who was Jubao's relative, whose mother's family was from which village, and who had what nickname... Da San didn't pay attention to those, but pointed at other people and asked, but Little Foreign Devil didn't pay attention to Da San's words either, and kept talking about those women. Suddenly, Da San noticed a young woman standing on a low stool next to the high-legged opera stool, holding a white porcelain teapot in her hand, with a white towel wrapped around her head. The white teapot and white towel made her face look fresh and red, her eyebrows dark black, and her eyes were fixed on the play on the stage, as if two beams of light had captured the actors. She wasn't wearing red or floral clothes, and her feet weren't bound too small or too big. It seemed that she wasn't as pretty as the young women on the high-legged opera stool, but Da San felt like he had seen her somewhere before, and felt very familiar with her, and felt that she was more beautiful and pleasing than all the women watching the play. Da San stared at her for a long time before quietly asking Little Foreign Devil, "Who is that woman?" Little Foreign Devil fluttered his eyelids a few times and replied, "Her? If you ask others, they might not know her! She is Jubao's maidservant, who he just bought not long ago. Her home is in Baiquan, and people call her Baiquan's girl. She's only eighteen years old." Then, Little Foreign Devil told Da San that Baiquan's girl was holding the teapot to serve Jubao's wife, and that Baiquan's girl's family was made up of such and such people, and how much money Jubao had spent to buy her... But Da San didn't pay attention to these words, but just stared at Baiquan's girl with his big eyes wide open. Little Foreign Devil called him, but he didn't respond; pushed him, but he didn't pay attention. He seemed lost in thought. Little Foreign Devil couldn't help but wonder. He saw that the Liugou family was not far ahead, laughing and scolding with someone, so he left Da San, pulled the Liugou family aside, and quietly pointed at Da San, not knowing what they were discussing.

    After Little Foreign Devil and the Liugou family discussed for a while, they turned back to look for Da San, wanting to ask him something, but Da San was gone. Little Foreign Devil asked people everywhere and looked everywhere, but couldn't find him. Later, he ran behind the opera stage, and saw a few people talking in the dry river ditch not far away, and it seemed that they were talking about Da San, so he shouted, "Uncle Da San!" and ran over.

    Da San was not among that group of people. Only Yubao was there, clapping his hands and saying, "The opera performance and worshiping the gods are originally for the sake of starting the kiln. It's not right for the leader not to come out and organize it. Besides, based on what he eats and wears, it's not like he doesn't have money! But he didn't even offer incense and candles, and just kowtowed twice." As soon as Little Foreign Devil heard this, he knew that this was talking about Da San, so he hurriedly tried to dissuade him, saying, "What are you saying, Yubao! Leaving the play unwatched, and here..." Yubao interrupted and said, "Who is leaving the play unwatched? Hmph! Da San is comfortably watching the play! I'm taking care of the opera performance and worshiping the gods, and even setting up a stove at the kiln is my business! The leader won't even assign someone else! Hmph! Who told me I wasn't born with the fate to watch the play!" Little Foreign Devil was very afraid of people causing trouble, and hurriedly winked at Yubao, saying, "Don't talk about him over a trivial matter! Everyone is doing the same kind of work!" Yubao grabbed the words and said, "It's not a trivial matter! He's been away from home for so many years, even if he doesn't believe in gods, he can't disrespect the Old Lord! Even if he doesn't organize the opera performance, he can't ignore the kiln's affairs! If there is any mistake in the work under the kiln, isn't that the leader's responsibility!" Little Foreign Devil couldn't find suitable words to persuade him, so he hurriedly stopped Yubao, saying, "Uh! Forget it! Say less! Anyway... uh, everyone is doing the same kind of work!" The people next to him were also afraid of trouble, so they helped Little Foreign Devil with a few words, and someone even said, "Xilu ordered the stove to be set up, Da San may not even know about it! You can't blame him for that. Forget it, Yubao!" Only then did Yubao shut his mouth, and led a few people to set up the stove towards the kiln. Little Foreign Devil also followed for a while, appeasing Yubao, telling him not to talk nonsense casually. After appeasing him, he turned back to the bottom of the opera stage. He had already forgotten about finding Da San. He went to watch the play.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（４）
    康濯
    四　看戏
    却说这四个人走到戏楼底，天禄是正经看戏去了，柳沟家也一边看戏一边跟男人们打闹耍笑去了，小洋鬼却连戏楼上正唱的山西梆子名戏“蝴蝶杯”也忘了看，就把大三拉到坡根底一个碾盘上坐着，指手划脚地捣拉起来；再说大三，他原本就不喜爱看戏，也不喜爱烘火热闹的，这回一来是为了陪他老二，二来是因为自从他回村以后，小洋鬼跟他捣拉的工夫最多，他慢慢觉着小洋鬼这人还不赖，就算交结了这么个朋友，乐意跟这朋友一道说说话；因此，他干脆就没想看戏，只顾跟着小洋鬼的指划瞎咯嚷去了。
    小洋鬼也没有说什么正经的，他只是指着那堆看戏的人，告给大三谁叫什么，这个那个都是谁谁；大三本来就不很认识村里的人们，所以听着也有些意思，有时他还插上两句，指着几个人问问。不过，大三问的都是男人，小洋鬼却偏好指着女人们告给大三；戏楼底东南角上，搁着一张专为看戏坐的高脚凳，那上面坐着一排妇女，打扮得红的花的满漂亮，小洋鬼就指着那悄悄告给大三，说那是大财主张聚宝家里的，说谁是聚宝的什么人，谁的妈家是哪村的，谁有什么外号……大三没注意那些，却指着另外的人问，但小洋鬼也没注意大三的话，还是一个劲说那些妇女。忽然，大三发现那高脚戏凳旁边的一条矮凳上，立着一个青年妇女，手里抱个白细磁茶壶，头上包一块白毛巾，白茶壶和白毛巾衬得她那脸红鲜鲜地，眉黑漆漆地，两眼望着台上的戏，真象是两道光射住了唱戏的人；她穿的也不红也不花，脚缠得也不小也不大，看来许没有高脚戏凳上的年轻女人漂亮，但大三却象在哪里见过她，又象跟她很熟快，并觉得她比所有看戏的女人还要漂亮喜人。大三两眼直望了她半天，才悄悄问小洋鬼道：“那女人是谁？”小洋鬼扑展了两下眼皮，答道：“她么？你问别人还许不认识哩！她是聚宝刚不大工夫买下的丫头使女，家在白泉，人们叫她白泉家，才十八岁。”接着，小洋鬼又告大三：白泉家抱的茶壶是侍候聚宝太太的，白泉家家里尽有些什么人，聚宝花了多少钱买的……但大三又没注意听这些话，只是两只大眼鼓得圆溜溜地，直楞楞望着白泉家，小洋鬼叫他他也不怎么答应，推他他也不怎么搭理，真象心思也乱了。小洋鬼不免稀罕起来，他见柳沟家这时正在前边不远跟人笑骂什么，他就撇开了大三，把柳沟家拉过一边，悄悄地指着大三，不知议论什么去了。
    小洋鬼和柳沟家议论了一阵，就又翻回来找大三，想问讯他个事，但大三却不见了。小洋鬼到处问人到处找，却找不见。后来他又跑到戏楼后面找，却见不远的干河沟里有几个人在说话，好象还在说大三什么的，他就吆喝着“大三叔！”跑过去了。
    那堆人里却也没有大三，只见玉宝在那里拍着巴掌说：“唱戏敬神原本为的开窑，当领事的倒不出来张罗，可说不过；再说，凭他吃的穿的，他又不是没钱！可连个香烛供献也不拿的，光干叩了两个头。”小洋鬼一听，知道这说的是大三，就忙打劝道：“你这说什么哩玉宝！放着戏不看的，在这……”玉宝抢着道：“谁放着戏不看？哼！他大三倒舒舒服服看戏呗！我给张罗唱戏敬神，连窑场上盘个炉子也是我的事！他当领事的就不会指派别人！哼！谁叫我没长着个看戏的命！”小洋鬼很怕人家闹事，忙向玉宝使着眼色道：“淡事情说他干什么！大伙都干的一手营生的！”玉宝道：“淡事情吧也不淡！他出门在外那么些年，不信神嘛，也不能不敬老君爷啊！不张罗唱戏嘛，也不能不管窑场的事啊！窑底下的营生，万一有个差错的，还不也是当领事的事！”小洋鬼找不出合适的话来劝说，只急忙止住玉宝道：“呃！算啦！少说两句！反正………呃，都干的一手营生的！”旁边人们也怕闹事，就帮衬小洋鬼两句，还有个人说：“这盘炉子是喜禄吩咐的，大三还不定知不知道哩！这也不能怨人家。算了吧，玉宝！”玉宝这才闭住嘴，领着几个人往窑场那边盘炉子去；小洋鬼又跟着走了一会，安插玉宝一顿，叫他不要随便说闲话。安插完了，他才又回头往戏楼底走，他这会是早忘了找大三的事，他看戏去了。
