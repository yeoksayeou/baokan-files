　　Sponsoring the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition
　　Railway Ministry Reduces Transportation Costs for Exhibits

　　[Our Newspaper] In order to support the industrial exhibition to be held in Tianjin at the end of this month, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has formulated measures to reduce and exempt transportation costs for exhibits and personnel traveling to Tianjin from all over the country via railway. These measures will be implemented in the Northeast, North, and South Railway Bureaus from the date each bureau receives the notice until January 10, 1950.

　　The reduced fee measures stipulate that exhibits (such as samples, models, specimens, charts, etc.) must be labeled with the word "Sample." Items weighing 100 kilograms or less, limited to one piece, may be transported free of charge by passenger or freight train. The portion exceeding this limit will be handled according to the 14th grade of exhibits. However, if the original grade is lower than the 14th grade, it will be handled according to the original grade of the goods. The same procedure applies to the return trip. Goods sold at the exhibition will be transported according to packaging or goods, and a special discount of 30% off the corresponding grade (full price without discount for grades 13 to 20) will be charged. The return trip will still be handled according to the original freight rate of the goods. The transportation of exhibits must be certified by a letter from the local government, factory, or industrial exhibition. For worker-peasant representative groups participating in the conference, tickets can be exchanged upon presentation of the above-mentioned letter, regardless of the distance or round trip. A special discount of 50% off the ordinary price will be charged, but express train fees will not be reduced. (People's Railway Newspaper)
