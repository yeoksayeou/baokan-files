　　Bandit and Special Agent Activities Shift to Decentralized Concealment;
　　剿匪 Campaign in Henan and Hubei Enters New Stage
　　Focus on Mobilizing the Masses, Combined with Comprehensive Suppression, Many Bandit Leaders Arrested
　　[Report from this newspaper] After the large-scale suppression, bandits and special agents in Henan and Hubei generally shifted to decentralized and concealed activities. A paralyzing thought of "no bandits to suppress" arose among many cadres and soldiers; some only focused on mobilizing the key masses and abandoned the mass-based 剿匪 movement; some abused cadres under the pretext of heavy workload, and some developed hedonistic thoughts and were unwilling to go to the mountains to suppress bandits, allowing bandits and special agents to take the opportunity to infiltrate farmers' associations, cadres, and militia for sabotage. Since breaking through at Lao Jun Temple in Henan Province, the phenomenon of pseudo-bandits infiltrating farmers' associations to sabotage mass movements has been widely discovered. In Yanling County, Xuchang Prefecture, in 40 villages in the third district (out of a total of 120 villages in the district), it was discovered that people who had been bandits in the past had become cadres and were still continuing their activities, directly threatening the rule of the masses. In Huang'an County, Hubei, a group of bandits, posing as our personnel, stayed in the village office for a day and a night, eating hundreds of pounds of public grain, and the cadres did not even notice. In the Dabie Mountains and Xiangyang Prefecture of the province, many district and village cadres were found to be colluding with and harboring bandits. In Xiaogan County, it was found that the Kuomintang district branch secretary and county party personnel had become workers in the Chadian district of the county. There were also incidents of local armed forces colluding with bandits, staging riots, and assassinating revolutionary cadres. Currently, the two provinces have severely criticized this paralysis and pointed out that rectifying organizations and rectifying the thinking of cadres are important links in the anti-bandit and anti-despot campaign. Local authorities and troops have focused on correcting the paralysis and underestimation of the enemy, conducted internal rectification, and carried out ideological mobilization for bandit suppression. In response to the various characteristics of collusion and decentralized concealment of bandits and bullies, a countermeasure of combining military with political measures and focusing on mobilizing the masses combined with comprehensive bandit suppression has been decided, bringing the bandit suppression movement into a new stage, and many hidden bandit leaders have been arrested. Wang Ziliang, the bandit leader in Biyang County who the local troops could not find for two months, Tang Tian'en, the bandit leader in Yiyang who hid in his sister's house, and Ji Tingjie and other eight giant bandits who ran 1,200 miles away were all captured under the circumstances of combining political and military measures and mobilizing the masses to suppress bandits.

　　匪特分散隐蔽活动　
    豫鄂剿匪进入新阶段            
    重点发动群众，结合全面清剿，不少匪首落网
    【本报讯】河南湖北匪特在大举清剿后，普遍转入分散隐蔽活动。不少干部与战士中发生了无匪可剿的麻痹思想；有的只顾重点发动群众放弃了群众性的剿匪运动，有的借口工作繁重滥用干部，还有的滋长了享乐思想，不愿上山剿匪，使匪特乘机打入农会、干部、民兵内部进行破坏。河南省从老君庙重点突破后，普遍发现伪匪人员打入农会破坏群众运动的现象，许昌分区的鄢陵县在三区四十个村中（全区共一百二十个村）都发现有过去当过土匪的当上干部并仍继续活动，直接威胁统治群众。湖北黄安县有一批土匪，冒充我方人员在村公所住了一天一夜，吃了几百斤公粮，干部们还没有发觉。在该省的大洪山区、襄阳专区均发现不少区、村干部通匪、窝匪。孝感县查出国民党的区分部书记与县党部人员竟当了该县察店区的工作员。还有地方武装通匪暴动暗害革命干部的事件发生。现在该两省对这种麻痹思想已做了严厉的批判，并指出整顿组织与整顿干部思想是剿匪反恶霸的重要环节。地方、部队都着重纠正了麻痹轻敌思想，进行内部整顿，并做了清匪的思想动员。针对着土匪恶霸勾结及分散隐蔽的种种特点，决定了以军事结合政治及重点发动群众结合全面清匪的对策，使清匪运动进入了新的阶段，有不少隐蔽匪首落网。泌阳县地方部队跑了两个月找不到的匪首王子良，藏到他姐姐家的宜阳匪首唐天恩，跑到一千二百里以外的姬廷杰等八名巨匪，都是在政治军事结合，发动群众人人剿匪的情况下被捉住的。
