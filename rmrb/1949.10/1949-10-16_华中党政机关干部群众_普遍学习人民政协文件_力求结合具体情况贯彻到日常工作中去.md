Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 14th: The Common Program, the Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the Organizational Law of the Central People's Government, all passed by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, have become the central focus of study for cadres in party and government organs and the broad masses in various parts of Central China. The Central Plains People's Government convened a cadre meeting of its affiliated units on the 3rd of this month. At the meeting, Chairman Deng Zihui explained that the three documents passed by the People's Political Consultative Conference are the people's great charter and a guarantee for the Chinese people to consolidate their victory and carry out construction in the future. He called on everyone to study these documents seriously and implement them thoroughly. Vice Chairman Li Yiqing called on every cadre in every department to integrate the government program passed by the People's Political Consultative Conference with the specific situation in the Central China region and implement it in their daily work. The Learning Committee of the General Office of the Central Plains People's Government convened a staff meeting of directly affiliated units to specifically arrange the study. The Wuhan Student Union also issued a notice calling on all Wuhan students to launch a study movement of the People's Political Consultative Conference documents. The Hubei Provincial Branch of the China Democratic League held a cadre symposium to study the three major documents of the People's Political Consultative Conference. The Hunan Provisional Provincial Government and the Changsha Military Control Commission emphasized the personal leadership of responsible personnel when arranging the study of the People's Political Consultative Conference documents. The Changsha Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to strengthen the leadership of the study with the party branch as the core. Old employees retained in various organs were organized to conduct collective study to enable them to understand the essential difference between the old and new regimes and to improve their political understanding and sense of responsibility for their work through study. The Learning Committee of the directly affiliated organs of Taoyuan County decided to strengthen the reporting and inspection system of learning, hold tests at the end of each month, and post scores to encourage learning. In addition to calling on the comrades of the trade union preparatory committees and working groups of various units to lead the workers and masses to study, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Changsha Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee will also regularly convene joint meetings of cultural and educational committee members to exchange experiences and promote learning. The preparatory committees of the trade unions of other institutions, such as the Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau, the Antimony Products Factory, the Postal Bureau, and the Yuehan Railway Bureau, are also actively leading workers to study the three major documents.
