　　Correcting Inferior Products
    Beijing Iron Foundries Meet
    Unanimously Agreeing on the Need to Improve Sand Casting
    [Beijing News] Recently, the products of private metal smelting factories in Beijing have been extremely inferior. The Private Industry Guidance Section of the Municipal Bureau of Industry, in order to guide the industry to improve technology and improve quality, specially convened meetings on the 7th and 13th of this month with more than 30 factories manufacturing waterwheels, machine parts, iron pots, and stoves. In recent times, many parties have placed orders with the factories in this industry. For example, the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Agency, the Ministry of Railways, and the China Supply and Marketing Cooperative have all placed orders with the factories in this industry. However, the factories in this industry have poor technology and use inferior raw materials, resulting in weak sand casting with many blowholes. The products are extremely inferior. For example, among the manufactured waterwheels sent to rural areas for use, an average of ten out of every hundred have axle failures or break in half. Farmers find it very inconvenient to carry the axles into the city for repair, which also reduces the farmers' interest in using machines to carry out production. At the meetings, the person in charge of the Bureau of Industry repeatedly emphasized that production cannot be based solely on a profit-driven viewpoint, but must be responsible to the people and guarantee excellent quality. After heated discussions, it was believed that in order to improve sand casting, in addition to using good raw materials, in terms of technology, the drawings, wooden patterns, and models must first be made accurately so that the dimensions and weight can be fixed and unified. During drying, the heat must be evenly distributed so that it is hard and free from blowholes. Each factory has decided to study and improve based on this preliminary conclusion and intends to organize a technical research institution to regularly exchange experiences.

　　纠正产品低劣现象
    京卅家铁厂集会
    一致认为必须改进翻砂
    【北京讯】北京市私营金属冶制业各厂近来产品极为低劣，市工业局私营工业指导科为指导该业改进技术，提高品质，特于本月七日及十三日分别召集制造水车、机器零件、铁锅、火炉的三十余家工厂举行座谈会。由于近来各方面该业各厂订货者甚多，如华北水利推进社、铁道部、中国供销社等机关均纷向该业各厂订货，而该业各厂技术和使用的原料不好，翻砂不坚固，且多有砂眼，产品均极低劣，如制成的水车运到乡村使用后，平均一百辆中有十辆车轴发生故障或断为两截，农民扛着车轴进城修理极不方便，同时也减低了农民使用机器以进行生产的兴趣。座谈会中工业局负责人数次强调指出：生产不能完全站在单纯营利观点上，一定要对人民负责，保证品质优良。经过热烈研讨，认为改进翻砂，除须使用好的原料外，在技术方面，首先要把图样、木型和模型制的精确，尺寸和重量才能固定统一，烘干时必须火力均匀，使之坚硬免生砂眼。各厂已决定根据这个初步结论研究改进，并拟组织技术究研机构，经常交流经验。
