Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 24th - Electric News Agency, Rome: Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti (formerly translated as Togliatti) stated during a parliamentary vote on the Interior Ministry budget on the evening of the 19th that the specific action the government could take to help ease the political situation would be the resignation of Interior Minister Scelba. His statement followed immediately after Scelba's speech, ending a week-long parliamentary debate on the Interior Ministry's police rule activities. In his speech, Togliatti pointed out that Scelba's speech this time was "different in tone" from before. His words were more like "a defendant defending himself." He admitted for the first time that some of the opposition's accusations had some basis. Togliatti finally appealed that Italy needs democracy to open the road to national reconstruction. He said to the silent government benches of Prime Minister Gasperi that this democratic unity requires "mutual understanding." He also urged the government to realize the social goals contained in the Republican Constitution.

During the debate, Communist and Socialist parliamentarians cited many typical examples, denouncing the Gasperi government's illegal crimes of using the police to persecute the working people. Italian Communist Party Deputy Secretary and resistance movement leader Longo particularly accused the government of shameful persecution of guerrillas. According to TASS, the Christian Democrats could not refute these condemnations and adopted a "strategy of silence," refusing to speak and leaving the meeting hall. At four consecutive meetings, the opposition representatives were virtually the only speakers.

　　托里亚蒂在国会演说
　  痛斥谢尔巴警察统治呼吁重建民主意大利
    【新华社北京二十四日电】电通社罗马讯：意大利共产党总书记托里亚蒂（前译托格里亚蒂）于十九日晚国会表决内政部预算时发表演说称：政府所能采取有助于缓和政治形势的具体行动，就是内政部长谢尔巴的辞职。他的这一声明紧接着谢尔巴的演说之后，结束了议会关于内政部警察统治活动为时约一周的辩论。托里亚蒂在演说中指出：谢尔巴这次的演说与以前“口气不同”。他的话更象“一个为自己辩护的被告”。他第一次承认了反对党的许多指责有一些根据。托里亚蒂最后呼吁说，意大利需要民主以打开国家重建的道路。他向着默不作声地坐着的总理加斯贝利的政府席说，这一民主的团结需要“相互了解”。他并督促政府实现共和国宪法所包含的社会目标。
    在辩论过程中，共产党与社会党的议员们列举了很多典型的例子，痛斥加斯贝利政府利用警察迫害劳动人民的违法罪行。意大利共产党副书记、抵抗运动领袖隆哥，特别指责政府地游击队员的可耻迫害。据塔斯社消息称，基督教民主党不能反驳这些谴责，而采取了“沉默策略”，拒绝发言并离开会议厅。在四次连续的会议上，反对党代表实际上唯一的发言者。
