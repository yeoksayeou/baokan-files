Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th. TASS, Prague dispatch:

　　On October 4th, the Czechoslovakian Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the Yugoslavian Embassy in Prague, stating: The Czechoslovakian government has authorized the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to notify the Yugoslavian Embassy that the facts exposed during the trial of Hungary's Rajk confirm the Yugoslavian government's long-standing hostile policy toward Czechoslovakia, as pointed out in Czechoslovakia's note to Yugoslavia in July 1949. This policy has developed into direct actions against the security of the Czechoslovak Republic. Several years ago, Czechoslovakian security agencies had already confirmed that Yugoslavian diplomatic representatives stationed in Czechoslovakia were organizing economic espionage activities, as evidenced by the provocative behavior of the Yugoslavian delegation at the 11th Congress of the Sokol organization held in Prague in 1948. After the Yugoslavian government openly became hostile to the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, a large number of personnel within the Yugoslavian Embassy in Prague systematically engaged in subversive activities. Czechoslovakian security organs have uncovered these spies closely collaborating with the espionage agencies of imperialist countries.

　　Based on proven facts, the Czechoslovakian Ministry of Foreign Affairs successively declared in July of this year that the Czechoslovakian government did not welcome the continued presence in Czechoslovakia of Yugoslavian Embassy Counselor Stambuk, Commercial Counselor Bilbaric, and his secretary Popova, and proposed that Yugoslavian Embassy Secretaries Gorski and Lovensic, as well as the Yugoslavian Consul General in Bratislava, Ruksic, leave Czechoslovakia.

　　During Rajk's trial, the names of Yugoslavian intelligence personnel in Czechoslovakia were revealed. In light of this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that the continued presence in Czechoslovakia of Yugoslavian Ambassador Stilinovic is unwelcome and requests that he be recalled.

　　The Ministry of Foreign Affairs offers this as a response to Yugoslavia's note of July 6, 1949, and draws the attention of the Yugoslavian Embassy to the fact that it has no right to mention the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation and the Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed on May 9, 1946, because the Yugoslavian government has thrown itself into the imperialist camp and become its tool, thereby nullifying the basis for concluding the treaties and greatly violating them. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informs the Yugoslavian Embassy that, based on all of the above, the Czech government considers itself no longer bound by the obligations undertaken by the Czechoslovak-Yugoslav Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation, and under the Cultural Cooperation Agreement.

### 捷克照会南国　废除捷南条约

　　捷克照会南国
    废除捷南条约
    【新华社北京七日电】塔斯社布拉格讯：十月四日，捷克斯洛伐克外交部将照会一件递交南斯拉夫驻布拉格大使馆，照会声称：捷克斯洛伐克政府授权外交部通知南斯拉夫大使馆，匈牙利拉伊克的审讯所暴露的事实，证实了一九四九年七月捷致南照会中业已指出的南斯拉夫政府久已对捷克斯洛伐克奉行敌对的政策，这一政策并已发展成为直接反对捷克斯洛伐克共和国安全的行动。数年前，捷克斯洛伐克的保安机构就已确知南斯拉夫驻捷的外交代表正在组织经济谍报活动，一九四八年在布拉格举行的鹰社第十一届代表会议上南斯拉夫代表团的挑拨行为，就是明证。当南斯拉夫政府对苏联和人民民主国家公开敌视后，南斯拉夫驻布拉格大使馆内的大批人员，便有计划地从事颠覆性活动，捷克斯洛伐克的保安机关已揭发这些间谍分子与帝国主义国家的谍报机关密切合作。
    基于业已证明了的事实，本年七月捷外交部先后声明，不欢迎南斯拉夫大使馆参赞斯塔姆布克、商务参赞比尔巴利奇及其秘书博波娃留驻捷克，并提议南斯拉夫大使馆秘书高尔斯基与洛文西奇和南斯拉夫驻布拉的斯拉发总领事鲁克西奇离开捷克斯洛伐克。
    在拉伊克的审讯中，南斯拉夫在捷的谍报人员被指出姓名来。外交部有鉴于此，认为南斯拉夫大使斯蒂利诺维奇留驻捷克斯洛伐克不受欢迎，并要求将其召回。
    外交部以此作为对南斯拉夫一九四九年七月六日照会的答复，并促使南斯拉夫大使馆注意：它没有权利提到一九四六年五月九日所签订的友好互助与战后合作条约和文化合作协定，因为南斯拉夫政府已投入帝国主义阵营且成为其工具，自己取消了缔结条约的基础，从而大大地违背了这些条约。外交部通知南斯拉夫大使馆：基于上述一切，捷克政府认为她不再受由捷南友好互助与战后合作条约以及根据文化合作协定所承担的义务的约束。
