Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th: TASS reports that the latest issue of "New Times" magazine published an editorial entitled "Powerful Demonstration of Peace Forces." The editorial first points out: The celebration of the International Day of Struggle for Peace around the world was marked by unexpected success. The movement of people around the world supporting peace on October 2 demonstrates how powerful the forces that have been mobilized are. The enthusiastic celebration of the International Day of Struggle for Peace by the Soviet people vividly proves the Soviet people's unanimous support for Stalin's peaceful foreign policy.

The editorial continued: October 2nd must have taught the most stubborn reactionaries a lesson: all upright and righteous people in the world, regardless of race, nationality, social status or political beliefs, see themselves as members of the powerful ranks of peace fighters.

The camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union is stronger than ever. Only a madman would ignore the fact that such a large mass of people has united under the banner of the peace struggle that has been launched. One only needs to list the events that occurred at the end of September 1949, such as the proclamation of the People's Republic of China with a population of nearly 500 million and the bankruptcy of atomic diplomacy (which relies on the myth of the American monopoly on the atomic bomb), to convincingly illustrate that the balance of power on the international stage is changing, increasingly in favor of the peace camp that is fighting against the warmongers of the Anglo-American bloc.

The editorial said: The people's aspirations for peace are also manifested in the foreign policy of the great Soviet socialist country and the foreign policy of the people's democratic countries. This makes the call for peace especially powerful. It provides unprecedented and previously impossible strong support for the movement for peace.

The editorial pointed out that the Soviet delegation's proposal at the United Nations General Assembly for a plan to defend universal security has become a plan for the struggle for peace in all countries. Referring to the atomic bomb issue, the editorial said:

Of great significance in this regard is the worldwide reaction to the TASS statement of September 25. The masses everywhere welcomed this statement with deep satisfaction and joy. For four years, the people who had been intimidated by the imperialists' lie that the United States had a monopoly on the atomic bomb are now truly relieved.

In the hands of American imperialism, the atomic bomb is a permanent threat to peace, a means of intimidating the timid, and a tool for unscrupulous blackmail. Conversely, the Soviet Union's success in mastering atomic energy fills mankind with hope for a bright future and inspires new confidence that war can be avoided. World opinion is deeply moved by the fact that although the Soviet Union had already possessed the secret of atomic weapons as early as 1947, it has consistently striven to ban the atomic bomb during these years and continues to adhere to this position today.

The editorial wrote: The warmongers still disregard new and old historical lessons. They continue to follow their policy of aggression, hinder international cooperation, undermine the United Nations, intensify the war psychosis, and accelerate the arms race.

The editorial concluded: International Peace Day is a powerful demonstration against the warmongers. Millions of civilians are increasingly aware of their strength and are fully determined to fight for peace until victory.

### 和平力量的强大示威　新时代社论庆祝国际和平日成功

　　和平力量的强大示威
    新时代社论庆祝国际和平日成功
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯，最近一期新时代杂志以“和平力量的强大示威”为题，发表社论。该社论首先指出：世界各地的庆祝国际和平斗争日，是以出乎意料之外的成功为标志。十月二日全世界各地人民拥护和平的运动说明：已经行动起来的力量是多么强大。苏联人民的热烈庆祝国际和平斗争日，生动的证明了苏联人民一致拥护斯大林的和平外交政策。
    社论继称：十月二日一定教训了最顽固的反动分子，全世界一切正直而有正义感的人民，他们是不分种族、国籍、社会地位或政治信仰，都把自己看作是和平战士的强大队伍的一员。
    以苏联为首的和平民主与社会主义反帝国主义阵营比过去任何时候都更强大了。如此广大的群众已团结在发动起来了的和平斗争的旗帜之下，只有疯子才会加以漠视。人们只须列举一九四九年九月底所发生的事件，例如几达五万万人口的中华人民共和国的宣告成立和原子外交（它依靠于美国垄断原子弹这个神话）的破产，就足以令人信服地说明：国际舞台上力量的对比正在改变，而日益有利于正在与英美集团的战争贩子进行斗争的和平阵营。
    社论说：人民争取和平的抱负，也表现在伟大的苏维埃社会主义国家的外交政策和人民民主国家的外交政策上。这使和平拥护的呼声格外的有力量。它给争取和平运动提供了前所未有的和前所不能有的强大的支持。
    社论指出：苏联代表团在联大所建议的保卫普遍安全的方案，已成为在一切国家中争取和平斗争的方案。提及原子弹问题时，该社论说：
    在这一方面有很大意义的是全世界对塔斯社九月二十五日声明的反应。群众到处都以深深的满意和快慰来欢迎这一声明。四年来，受到帝国主义者以美国独占原子弹的谎言所恫吓的人民，现在真正安心了。
    在美国帝国主义手里，原子弹就是对和平的永久的威胁，就是恫吓胆怯者的手段，肆无忌惮的讹诈的工具。相反地，苏联在掌握原子能上的成功，却使人类对光明的将来充满了希望，鼓舞了新的信心，即战争是能够避免的。世界的舆论都深为这一事实所感动，即虽然苏联早在一九四七年就已保有原子武器的秘密，但它在这几年中却一贯地为禁止原子弹而努力，且直到今天仍然坚持这一立场。
    该社论写道：战争贩子们仍然漠视新的和旧的历史教训。他们继续遵循其侵略的方针，阻碍国际合作，破坏联合国，加剧战争心理状态和加速军备竞赛。
    社论结语称：国际和平日是反对战争贩子的强大的示威。千百万的平民已愈来愈意识到他们的力量，并且完全决心为和平而战斗，直到胜利为止。
