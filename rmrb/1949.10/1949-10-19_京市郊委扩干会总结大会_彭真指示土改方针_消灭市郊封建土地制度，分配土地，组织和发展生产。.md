　　Beijing Municipal Suburban Committee Holds Enlarged Cadre Meeting Summary Conference
  　Peng Zhen Instructs on Land Reform Policy
    Eliminate the Suburban Feudal Land System, Distribute Land, Organize and Develop Production.
    [Beijing News] The Enlarged Cadre Meeting of the Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held a summary conference on the 17th. More than 700 cadres attended. Chai Zemin, Secretary of the Suburban Committee, made a summary report, and Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the conference and delivered a speech, instructing on land reform work in the suburbs. In his summary report, Chai Zemin first clearly pointed out that the general policy of land reform is to take poor peasants and farm laborers as the leading backbone, unite with middle peasants, unite with all peasants, eliminate the feudal and semi-feudal land system in a step-by-step manner, reasonably distribute land to peasants for cultivation according to their needs, and abolish the high-interest loans owed by the working people to landlords and rich peasants. Secondly, he explained some specific issues in implementing the policy, such as giving priority to solving the problems of poor peasants, farm laborers, and impoverished families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who rely on land for a living when distributing land, farm tools, and grain. All issues should be decided based on specific circumstances. Finally, he pointed out how to mobilize the masses to join farmers' associations, how to elect peasant representative conferences, how to rely on the masses to carry out land reform work, and not to neglect the organization of youth and women's work in rural areas. In order to strengthen the country's transportation construction, government cadres should mobilize the masses to voluntarily contribute materials related to railway construction to facilitate the people's transportation work. In the afternoon, Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally attended the meeting and delivered a speech, which was warmly welcomed by all cadres. He first pointed out that the purpose of land reform is to lead the peasants to eliminate the feudal land system in the suburbs, distribute land, and organize and develop production. Then he pointed out that cadres should lead the masses to distribute land themselves in the process of leading land reform, and should not "take over" or "replace" them. It is necessary to defeat the arrogance of the landlord class, and resolutely struggle against bullies and all bad elements who obstruct land reform, but no indiscriminate beating or killing is allowed; it is necessary to eliminate the feudal and semi-feudal land system and confiscate landlords' land, farm tools, grain, etc., but no infringement on the interests of middle peasants is allowed, and no infringement on industry and commerce is allowed. The government should not only protect general industry and commerce, but also protect the industry and commerce of landlords and rich peasants. Finally, in addition to pointing out the importance of the form of representative conferences, he earnestly told cadres that in carrying out land reform, it is necessary to first conduct investigation work, that is, to lead the peasant masses to first delineate classes (assessment of classes must require the person to be present), to ascertain the quality and quantity of land and the needs of peasants for land, in order to reasonably distribute land.

　　京市郊委扩干会总结大会
  　彭真指示土改方针
    消灭市郊封建土地制度，分配土地，组织和发展生产。
    【北京讯】中共北京市委郊区工作委员会扩大干部会议于十七日举行总结大会。到会干部七百余人。由郊委书记柴泽民作总结报告，中共北京市委书记彭真亲临大会讲话，指示郊区土地改革工作。柴泽民在总结报告中首先明确指出土地改革的总的方针是以贫雇农为领导骨干，团结中农，团结全体农民，有步骤的消灭封建半封建的土地制度，依据农民需要，合理分配土地给农民耕种，废除劳动人民所欠地主、富农的高利贷。其次又说明在执行政策时的一些具体问题，如分配土地、农具、粮食时应尽先解决依靠土地为生的贫雇农和贫苦烈属军属的问题。一切问题要根据具体情况来决定。最后又指出了如何发动群众加入农会，如何产生农民代表会，如何依靠群众进行土地改革工作，更不要忽略了组织农村中的青年及妇女工作。又为了加强国家的运输建设，政府干部要发动群众自动献出有关建筑铁路的器材，以利人民的运输工作。下午，中共北京市市委书记彭真亲自到会讲话，受到了全体干部热烈欢迎。他首先指出土地改革的目的是领导农民消灭市郊封建土地制度，分配土地，组织和发展生产。接着他指出干部在领导土地改革的过程中要领导群众自己动手分配土地，切不要“包办”、“代替”。要斗倒地主阶级的威风，对恶霸及一切阻止土地改革的坏蛋要进行坚决的斗争，但不得乱打乱杀；要消灭封建半封建的土地制度，没收地主土地、农具、粮食等，但切不可侵犯中农的任何利益，切不可侵犯工商业，政府不仅要保护一般工商业，而且要保护地主富农的工商业。最后他除指出代表会议形式的重要性外，并谆谆告诉干部，在进行土地改革中首先要进行调查工作，即领导农民群众先划清阶级（评定阶级必须本人到会），查清土地的好坏和数量及农民对于土地需要状况，才能合理的分配土地。
