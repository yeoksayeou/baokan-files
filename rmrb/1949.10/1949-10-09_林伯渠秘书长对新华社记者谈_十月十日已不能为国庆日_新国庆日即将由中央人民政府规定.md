    October 10th Can No Longer Be the National Day
    New National Day to be Determined by the Central People's Government
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th] October 10th is a memorable day, but this day can no longer be the National Day of China. This is what Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter. Secretary-General Lin said: The People's Republic of China must stipulate a new National Day, which will be determined by the Central People's Government soon. October 10th is the anniversary of the historically significant Xinhai Revolution. However, the achievements of the Xinhai Revolution led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen were quickly usurped by the national thief Yuan Shikai, and the revolution itself failed. The revolution from 1925 to 1927 was also usurped by the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek and also failed. Therefore, the so-called "Republic of China" of the past thirty-eight years has violated the will of the people of the whole country and also the will of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. We commemorated October 10th in the past because we wanted to awaken the people of the whole country, inherit the legacy of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and other revolutionary martyrs, overthrow internal and external oppressors, and establish a true People's Republic of China. Now the struggle of the people of the whole country has been successful, old China is dead, and new China is born, and there should be a new National Day. If nationals throughout the country and overseas Chinese hold commemorative meetings on October 10th, they should be allowed, but this day should not be celebrated as the National Day.

　　林伯渠秘书长对新华社记者谈
    十月十日已不能为国庆日
    新国庆日即将由中央人民政府规定
    【新华社北京八日电】十月十日是可纪念的一天，但是这一天已经不能做中国的国庆日，这是中央人民政府秘书长林伯渠告诉新华社记者的。林秘书长说：中华人民共和国必须规定新的国庆日，这将由中央人民政府在最近规定。十月十日是有历史意义的辛亥革命的纪念日。但是孙中山先生所领导的辛亥革命的成果，迅速地被窃国大盗袁世凯所篡夺，这个革命本身是失败了。一九二五年至一九二七年的革命，其成果又为匪首蒋介石所篡夺，也是失败了。因此，三十八年以来的所谓“中华民国”，是违背全国人民的意志的，也是违背孙中山先生的意志的。我们过去纪念十月十日，是因为我们要唤起全国人民，继承孙中山先生和其他革命先烈的遗志，推翻内外压迫者，建立真正的中华人民共和国。现在全国人民的奋斗，已经获得成功，旧中国已死亡，新中国已诞生，应当有新的国庆日。全国国民及国外华侨，如有在十月十日开纪念会的，应当允许，但不应当以这一天当做国庆日来庆祝了。
