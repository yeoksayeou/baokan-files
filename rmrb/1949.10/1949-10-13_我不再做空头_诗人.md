I Will No Longer Be a Hollow "Poet"
    Dong Lin

　　I used to be enthusiastic about writing poetry, dreaming of becoming a poet, burying myself all day in thick books like Pushkin's collected poems, Childe Harold, Homer, Juliet, Faust... trying to glean some beautiful verses from them. I would also hastily pile up some "beautiful" "words" into lines and send them to the editorial department. But I never saw my poems published in newspapers and magazines. So I felt "disappointed," I "sighed," alas! People are too un-"artistic" and cannot "appreciate" such "beautiful" poems.

　　In the old society, my teachers taught me content-less "public speaking methods," impractical "debating skills," taught me "art for art's sake," taught me to "become famous overnight," and I learned these things very well.

　　"Poet," what a lofty title, so I desperately delved into it, searching for my poems in a dead end. I also imagined becoming a celebrity overnight like Byron with the publication of "Childe Harold." Writing poetry was so easy, ordinary sentences that couldn't form an article became poetry when divided into lines, truly a shortcut to "success." Sometimes when I occasionally wrote something, and people praised it with three "not bad," I would also somewhat believe that I was a poet.

　　After liberation, I had not yet completely discarded these dirty things from the old society. Due to my own fantasies about the revolution and unrealistic romanticism, I once praised the revolution in a "poem" titled "The Revolutionary Bell," like this:

　　Listen!
　　The great bell of revolution
　　Rings leisurely!
　　It floats over mountains and rivers,
　　Rushes in all directions,
　　It drives away the darkness,
　　Brings light.
　　It warns the youth!
　　Quickly shoulder the great banner of freedom,
　　Use fresh blood to irrigate that
　　Beautiful revolutionary flower,
　　Let it bloom even more brightly,
　　Even more fragrantly!

　　At first glance, it sounds rhythmic and well-arranged. But upon careful reflection, it is full of flaws. Besides the abstract nouns like "darkness," "light," "great banner," etc., what exactly does it say? Where does the revolution get a "great bell"? How can this "great bell" "leisurely" "float over" mountains and rivers? And why is it giving a "warning" like an air raid? Revolution is originally an arduous struggle, how could it become a "beautiful," "bright," "fragrant" "flower"?...

　　Writing articles is like speaking, people are easily moved by sincere words, but they are disgusted by glib talk. Only by writing down truly moving words can you move others. Blindly playing with techniques and showing off in form is like the oily, painted characters in the old society, who can only be clowns on the stage today.

　　Recently, I read a collection of poems "The East is Red" (People's Literature and Art Series), which contains dozens of short poems created by workers, peasants, and soldiers. They all express such rich and real thoughts and feelings in such a concise and clear way. For example, one of the poems by a soldier about his rifle:

　　Hand grenade, good partner,
　　Enemies are finished when they see you,
　　Heroes get on the merit book,
　　You get half, I get half.

　　How strongly it reveals the love for one's weapon for killing enemies, the firm confidence in defeating the enemy, and the ardent fighting spirit. The creations of other workers and peasants also express the joyful mood of being masters of their own affairs, filled with lofty class friendship and ardent expectations and confidence in the construction of the new China. Why can they write such good poems? Because they are all practically living and working on the front lines of production and combat, with rich and real experiences of struggle. But I am not like this. I want to stand out, I want to find "shortcuts" in learning to write, and I think I can write a good poem by simply shouting a bunch of "passionate" words. I sit at my desk, staring at the sky outside the window, trying to dig out a miracle from my brain. I want to steal the "crown" of "poet" with one hand. But this "shortcut" does not exist in fact, and if you insist on drilling, you will break your nose and still not get through.

　　Now I understand, I understand what is revolution? What is revolution for? I understand the principle of serving the people. I will no longer be such a hollow poet. I should write about things I am familiar with, establish the spirit of serving the people, write what the people need, and honestly explain things clearly based on concrete and realistic materials, so that people can understand it at a glance. I must get rid of my faults of being ambitious but incompetent, aiming too high, liking fantasy, and not starting from reality. I must eradicate the idea that writing is for "showing off" and "gaining fame." I must go deep into practical life to train myself, and humbly be a pupil of workers, peasants, soldiers and the working masses, so that I can write things that are consistent with the thoughts and feelings of the masses and loved by the masses, and achieve the goal of literature and art serving the people. I must start from scratch, like a child learning to walk. I must first learn to crawl before I can learn to walk step by step, and then I can run and jump.

### 我不再做空头“诗人”

专栏：

　　我不再做空头“诗人”
    董临
    我曾热中于写诗，幻想做一个诗人，整天埋头在普式庚诗集，查尔德·哈罗，欧密罗与柔丽叶，浮士德………等厚甸甸的册子里，想在那里拈得一些美妙的诗句。我又匆匆忙忙地把一些“美丽”的“词藻”堆砌成一行行的，寄到编辑部去了。可是在报纸和刊物上总看不见我的诗篇登出来。于是我“失望”，我“叹息”，唉！人们太不“艺术”了，这样“美丽”的诗篇都“欣赏”不了。
    旧社会里，先生教我些不讲内容的“讲演法”，脱离实际的“辩论术”，教我“为艺术而艺术”，教我“一举成名天下知”，这些，我都学得很好。
    “诗人”，多么崇高的称号，于是我拼命的钻，钻到牛角尖里去找我的诗。也想象拜仑一样，出版了“查尔德·哈罗”一夜便成了红人，写诗又是这样的轻而易举，平常写文章连不成气的句子，分成一行一行就成了诗，实在是一条“登龙”捷径。有时偶而写了个什么东西，人家三个“还不错”一夸，自己也就有点相信自己是诗人了。
    解放了，我还没有把旧社会的这些脏东西抛干净，由于自己对革命的幻想，和脱离现实的浪漫主义，我曾在一首题名“革命的钟声”的“诗”里，这样歌颂着革命：
    听啊！
    革命的巨钟
    悠悠然响了！
    它飘过山川，
    奔向四方，
    它驱走了黑暗，
    带来了光明。
    它警报着青年！
    快扛起自由的大旗，
    用鲜血去灌溉那
    美丽的革命花朵，
    让她开得更加鲜艳，
    更加芬芳！
    猛一看，倒音韵铿锵，排列整齐。但仔细思索一下，就毛病百出了。除了满篇的“黑暗”“光明”“大旗”……等抽象的名词外，究竟说了些什么？革命何来“巨钟”？这“巨钟”又何至于“悠悠然”“飘过”山川？又不是敌机空袭打“警报”做什么？革命本来是一件艰苦的斗争，怎么会成了“美丽”、“鲜艳”、“芬芳”的“花朵”？……
    写文章跟说话一样，说真心老实话人家容易感动，油腔滑调别人一听就讨厌。只有把真心感动的话写出来，才能感动别人。一味的玩弄技巧，在形式上耍花样，就好象旧社会里油头粉脸的人物，在今天只能是舞台上的丑角了。
    最近我读了一本诗集“东方红”（人民文艺丛书），里面是几十篇工农兵的短篇诗创作。它们都是那样精练、明快地表达了那样丰富、真实的思想感情。如其中有一篇战士的枪杆诗：
    手榴弹，好伙伴，
    敌人见你就完蛋，
    英雄上了功劳簿，
    你一半来我一半。
    多么强烈的流露出对自己杀敌武器的热爱，战胜敌人的坚强的信心和火热的战斗情绪。其他工人、农民的创作也都同样的表现了翻身作主人的快乐情绪，充满了崇高的阶级友爱和对新中国建设热烈的期望与信心。为什么他们能写出这样好的诗呢？原来他们都是实际生活、锻炼在生产、战斗的战线上，有着丰富、真切的斗争体验。而我却不是这样，我想自己出人头地，我想在学习写作上钻“巧门”，单凭“热情”地空喊一泡便自以为是一首好诗，我坐在写字台上，眼睛瞪着窗外的天，想硬从脑袋瓜子里挖出个奇迹来，我想把“诗人”的“冠冕”一手窃过来。但这“巧门”事实上是不存在的，硬要钻，碰扁了鼻子也钻不进去。
    现在我懂得了，懂得了什么是革命？革命做什么？懂得了为人民服务的道理。我不再做那样的空头诗人，我应当写一些我所熟知的事情，确立为人民服务的精神，写人民需要的东西，根据具体现实的材料，老老实实地把事情交待个明白，使人家一看能懂就成了。一定要改掉自己眼高手低，好高鹜远，喜欢幻想，不从实际出发的毛病。根除自己写作是为了“出风头”“搞名誉”的思想。深入到实际生活里去锻炼，虚心做工农兵劳苦大众的小学生，才能写出和群众思想感情一致、为群众所喜爱的东西，才能达到文艺为人民服务的目的。我必须从头学起，象小孩子学走路一样，一定要先学着顺地溜，才能学着一步步走，然后才能跑、能跳。
