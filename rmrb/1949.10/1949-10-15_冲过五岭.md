　　Crossing the Five Ridges
    Tan Luofu, Li Zezhong, Lu Zhuguo

    "Passing through Chest Mountain, three feet and three inches from the sky, people must lower their heads, and horses must remove their saddles."

    As the southward marching army entered southern Hunan from southern Jiangxi, they encountered the Five Ridges mountain range, towering for fifteen *li*. Local people introduced this ancient proverb, passed down for thousands of years, to the commanders and fighters. The cliff-like peaks stood before our great army. Obviously, crossing them would be extremely difficult. But the People's Liberation Army, having overcome countless obstacles, demonstrated boundless heroism in the face of this natural barrier, joyfully accepting the challenge.

    On September 25th, a certain regiment began to climb this mountain. Ge, the head of the 3rd Brigade, though physically weak, took the lead by carrying a large document bag uphill, setting an example. Nearing the summit, his body could no longer support him and he fell, his leg broken and bleeding. Soldiers rushed over, saying, "Regiment leader, don't exhaust yourself!" and tried to take the bag from him. But he refused, immediately climbing to his feet and continuing forward, saying to everyone, "In the face of a Communist Party member, any difficulty can be overcome. Comrades, keep going!" The regiment leader's inspiring act quickly spread to every company and platoon. A large number of new activists immediately emerged within the units, vying to carry guns, rice, and packs for the weak and sick comrades. The sick also gritted their teeth, fighting against the steep mountain path and the sharp pebbles under their feet.

    The massive artillery teams displayed even more astonishing miracles as they crossed the peak. After carrying two 130 *jin* wheels to the top of the mountain, soldier Liang Zhanfa helped everyone carry the 170 *jin* gun body up as well. Ascending and descending directly on the rocky path, sweat soaked through his clothes. At this time, the instructor and deputy company commander also came up carrying 70-80 *jin* gun carriages. The soldiers became even more excited, shouting, "Instructor, let's have a competition!" Li Shenghe picked up the 170+ *jin* gun body and said to Luo Wenliang, "Let's two carry this big guy up!" And with that, he took a big step up the mountain.

    The livestock climbed the steep slope, practically standing upright on their two hooves. The soldiers carefully led the animals, while laboriously carrying gun carriages or wheels. When they encountered the most dangerous places, they gathered together, trying everything possible to ensure the animals could pass safely.

    Having conquered the difficulties, the commanders and fighters cheered at the summit. Soldiers proudly said, "The road isn't longer than my legs, the mountain isn't higher than my instep, there are no difficulties that the People's Liberation Army cannot overcome."

    As the long and majestic marching column passed through Guidong County, the residents stared in amazement at the artillery unit's strong horses. An old man named Li said, "Since ancient times, no one has ever heard of livestock being able to walk on Chest Mountain. You are truly heavenly soldiers and generals!"

　　冲过五岭
    谭洛夫　李泽忠　陆柱国
    “路过胸膛山，离天三尺三，人过须低头，马过须摘鞍。”
    南进大军由赣南进入湘南，便碰上这高达十五里的五岭山脉。当地人民把这首流传了千百年的古谚，介绍给指战员们。峭壁一般的山峰，矗立在我大军的面前，显然，要翻越过去是十分困难的。但曾经克服过无数险阻的人民解放军，在这自然界的阻碍面前，都表现了无限的英雄气概，一个个兴奋愉快地接受这个考验。
    九月二十五日某团开始攀登这座山峰，警三旅葛团长虽然身体很弱，却首先扛了一个大文件包，以身作则带头上山，快要到山顶了，身体实在支持不住倒下来，腿被摔破流血。战士们跑过去说：“团长不要累坏了！”抢着替他扛。但他拒绝了，他立即爬起来继续前进，并对大家说：“在共产党员面前任何困难都可以克服，同志们加油啊！”团长动人的事情，迅速传遍了每个连排，部队里立即出现了大批的新的积极分子，纷纷替体弱和有病的同志扛枪背米背被包，病号也咬紧牙关，和面前陡峭的山路，和脚下刺人的碎石子作斗争。
    巨大的炮队在翻越高峰时，更表现了惊人的奇迹。战士梁占法把一百三十斤重的两个车轮扛到山顶后，又帮助大家把一百七十斤重的炮身也扛上去。沿着碎石路直上直下，汗把衣服都湿透了。这时指导员和副连长也扛着七八十斤重的炮架上来了，战士们更激动起来，大声喊着：“指导员，咱们比赛比赛！”李生河扛起一百七十多斤重的炮身对罗文良说：“咱们俩把这大家伙扛上去！”说着就抬起大步上山了。
    牲口从笔直的山坡上攀登，简直象两条蹄子站起来直走一样。战士们一面谨慎地牵着牲口，一面吃力地扛着炮架或车轮，在遇到最危险的地方，他们就集中起来，想尽一切办法，使牲口能够安全地通过。
    战胜了困难的指战员们，在山顶上活跃欢呼，战士们骄傲地说：“路远没有我腿干长，山高没有我脚面高，解放军的面前没有克服不了的困难”。
    当这漫长的雄伟进军行列经过桂东县城时，居民们望着炮兵部队的强壮的马匹都发愣了，一个李老头说：“自古就没有听说过胸膛山能走牲口，你们真是天兵天将！”
