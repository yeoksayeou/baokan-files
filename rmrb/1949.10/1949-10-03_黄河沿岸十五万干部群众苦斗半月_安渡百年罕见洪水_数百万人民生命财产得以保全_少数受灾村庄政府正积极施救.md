[Newxiang Electric Dispatch] The third Yellow River flood this year, a rare event in a century, has been safely overcome through the arduous struggle of local Party, government, military, and civilians. According to the water level at Shanzhou, the Yellow River began to rise on September 6th and entered its most critical stage on the 13th. From Kaifeng to Qihe, the entire line experienced dam erosion and cave-ins, with breaches appearing one after another. Due to prolonged immersion and seepage, the embankment lines had numerous areas of collapse and water penetration, some extending for several *li*, creating a critical situation. By the 21st, the water level had returned to normal, lasting a total of sixteen days.

The characteristics of this flood were as follows: continuous heavy rain in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, and Pingyuan provinces beginning on August 5th, leading to mountain torrents and sudden rises in tributaries, causing a sharp increase in the Yellow River's water level. Consequently, the water volume and duration of the flood increased and extended. The flow rate at Shanzhou of 10,000 cubic meters per second lasted for 99 hours, and a flow rate of 5,000 cubic meters per second lasted for 299 hours. Based on the latter, the total flow reached over 8.9 billion cubic meters, exceeding the 1933 volume (2.7 billion) by more than three times, making it the largest flood in nearly a century.

When the flood surged and the embankment lines were in imminent danger, fortunately, preparations had been made in advance, and water conditions were well-understood. Approximately 4,000 cadres at all levels along the river promptly led 150,000 people to the embankment to guard and repair the embankment (200 kilometers), and opened the *minnian* [people's dikes] of Xuzhuang below Liangshan County and Yanshan in Shouzhang County, storing 500 million cubic meters of water (within Liangshan). Fortunately, the water level dropped one to seven *cun* at the most critical time. Although there were local losses at that time, the eastern dam of Pingyuan was preserved.

Our vast numbers of cadres and masses, after half a month of arduous struggle, safely passed the flood, protecting the lives and property of millions of people. However, due to the large and fierce waters, all the people’s dikes overflowed and collapsed. Approximately 1,820 villages in the riverbed area and in Shouzhang, Liangshan, and other counties were flooded, affecting a population of approximately 800,000. The most severely affected accounted for about half, with most of the houses collapsing, 25 people drowning, and 13 people washed away and missing. Crops were completely destroyed. The government is currently conducting emergency relief in the disaster areas, resettling refugees, and assisting in salvaging crops and property. However, at present, the water depth at the dike roots below Dong'e and in the Zhangqiu section is still one to three meters, and the danger there has not passed. Therefore, in the future, we should strengthen dam construction so that it can withstand floods, deepen organizational work, fully achieve mass-based embankment protection and flood prevention, educate cadres and the masses, overcome localism, and at the same time solve the livelihood and production problems of the people in the flooded areas, ensuring that the policy of abolishing *minnian* to protect the main dam is implemented.

[Another dispatch] Due to rainfall on the 23rd and 24th, the tributaries of the Yellow River rose again, but by the 26th, the entire river had generally receded. The flow at Xianyang had dropped to 780 cubic meters per second, the flow at Huayuankou to 6,850 cubic meters per second, the flow at Tongguan to 6,200 cubic meters per second, and the flow at Shanzhou to 6,000 cubic meters per second.

　　黄河沿岸十五万干部群众苦斗半月
  　安渡百年罕见洪水
    数百万人民生命财产得以保全少数受灾村庄政府正积极施救
    【新乡电】本年第三次的黄河洪水，为百年来所罕见，经当地党政军民艰苦斗争，现主要危险已安全渡过。根据陕州之水位，黄河从九月六日即开始上涨，自十三日进入最紧张阶段。从开封至齐河，全线扫坝蛰陷，漏洞迭出。堤线因深水渗浸过久，凹蛰透水者颇多，长者竟达数华里，情况危急。至二十一日，始恢复平常水位，总计为时达十六日。此次洪水之特点：是因山西、陕西、甘肃、河南、平原等省，自八月五日开始，霪雨连绵，山洪暴发，支河陡涨，引起黄河水位暴涨。黄水水量与持续时间，也因之增大与延长。陕州一万秒立方公尺之流量持续达九十九小时，五千秒立方公尺之流量持续二百九十九小时，以后者计算，总流量共达八十九亿余立方公尺，超过一九三三年水量（二十七亿）三倍以上，为近百年来所罕有之大水。当洪水猛涨，堤线岌岌可危时，幸赖事先已有准备，水情灵通，沿河各级干部约四千人，即迅速带十五万群众上堤护守，抢修堤埝（二百公里），并将梁山县徐庄以下及寿张县之严善人民埝扫开，蓄水五亿公方（梁山境内），幸在最紧急时期，水位降落一至七公寸，当时虽局部受到损失，但平原东大堤得赖以保全。我广大干部和群众经过半月的艰苦斗争，安全渡过了洪水，保卫了数百万人民的生命财产。但因水大势猛，全部民埝漫溢、溃决，河床村与寿张、梁山等县共被淹约一千八百二十个村，人口约八十余万，灾情严重者约占二分之一，房屋大部倒塌，淹死二十五人，水冲走下落不明者十三人，庄稼全毁。现政府正在灾区进行急赈，安置难民，帮助打捞庄稼和资财。但目前东阿以下及张秋段堤根，水深仍在一至三公尺，该处危险尚未过去。因此，今后仍应加强坝堤工，使之能抵御洪水，深入组织工作，完全做到群众性的护堤防洪，教育干部和群众，克服地方主义，同时解决水区群众生活生产问题，务使废除民埝保全大堤的方针得到贯彻。
    【又讯】黄河因二十三、二十四两日阴雨，本支流又曾上涨，但至二十六日全河已普遍下降，咸阳流量已降至七八○秒立方公尺，花园口流量至六八五○秒立方公尺，潼关流量至六二○○秒立方公尺，陕州流量则降至六千秒立方公尺。
