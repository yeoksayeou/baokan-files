Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 4th. Nanjing's million citizens, in unparalleled fervor, celebrated the founding of the People's Republic of China and held a demonstration to defend world peace. At around 5:00 AM in the drizzling rain, over a hundred representatives from all walks of life gathered in front of the Peace Bastion at Xinjiekou to hold a flag-raising ceremony. All organs, troops, schools, and organizations in the city also held separate flag-raising ceremonies at the same time, with military music and firecrackers resounding throughout. At 4:00 PM, 500,000 people held a grand demonstration parade to celebrate the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and to defend world peace. The procession stretched for 150 li. Xinjiekou Square, located in the city center, became the gathering point for the demonstration parade. Here, the "Peace Bastion," with huge portraits of Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Zhu De and the five-star national flag hanging high, was surrounded by the special forces' giant howitzers and heavy mortars. At 5:00 PM, the parade from each district passed through Xinjiekou Square one after another, and the cheers of "Long Live Chairman Mao" shook the sky. Among the American-equipped troops participating in the parade, the artillery units that had just returned victoriously from the front lines and the naval fighters of the "Changzhi" uprising were particularly eye-catching. Next was the magnificent procession of the East China Military and Political University, which boasts more than 8,000 revolutionary intellectuals, and the teams of production enterprises decorated with various production tools. Among them, the Nanjing Water Plant's propaganda vehicle was equipped with a large water tower that was constantly flowing water, the Agricultural Machinery Company's team had a cotton gin rolling white cotton, and the farmers led "big water buffaloes" in the parade. In the masquerade propaganda team, the white-clothed "Goddess of Peace" was cheered, while the "war-mongers" imprisoned in iron cages were cursed. At night, the city's lights and the torches of the parade illuminated the sky of the people's Nanjing.
