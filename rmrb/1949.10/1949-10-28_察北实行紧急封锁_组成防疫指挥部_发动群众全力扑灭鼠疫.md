[Chabei News] The Party, government, and military in Chabei have been urgently mobilized to implement emergency lockdowns and isolation, strictly preventing the spread of plague. The Chabei District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued an urgent decision on the 21st, stating: (1) The entire Party, army, and all cadres must be highly responsible for the people's lives, promote a calm and tenacious spirit, and mobilize the masses to overcome this disaster. (2) Special districts and counties should immediately establish epidemic prevention headquarters, and districts and villages should establish command posts. Party committees at all levels should resolutely ensure the execution of all orders, arrangements, and instructions from higher-level headquarters. Those who violate these will be dealt with according to Party discipline. (3) Epidemic areas and adjacent areas should make epidemic prevention work the overriding central task. Other areas should also regard epidemic prevention as an important task.

[Further News] The Chabei Special District Epidemic Prevention Headquarters was established on the 21st of this month. It issued its second order: (1) Each county, district, and village should immediately establish epidemic prevention organizations to fully command the epidemic prevention work. The county should have an epidemic prevention headquarters composed of the political commissar of the county brigade, the brigade commander, and the county head, with a staff section and a medical prevention section. The staff section is responsible for blockade inspection, isolation, intelligence, and handling deaths; the medical prevention section is responsible for treatment, inspection, and hygiene. District and village epidemic prevention stations should be composed of the main responsible cadres of the Party and government. (2) The first line of defense should be established from Duolun in the east to the junction of Shangdu and Zuyindi in the west, and the second line of defense should be established along the outer wall. Military lockdown will be implemented, prohibiting the passage of any personnel, vehicles, or livestock (including cats, dogs, rats, etc.). Each county should specifically designate epidemic prevention line villages within its jurisdiction, dispatch capable cadres to lead local armed forces and militia to strictly define their duties, and implement the lockdown. (3) Inspection stations should be set up in Zhangbei Gonghui, Ertai, Mantouying, and Shangyi Daqinggou. Anyone suspected of having the plague should be immediately detained and isolated. In order to vigorously publicize and mobilize a mass epidemic prevention movement, the Special District Headquarters printed epidemic prevention propaganda materials overnight on the 21st and convened a mobilization meeting for responsible cadres of various agencies stationed in the special district on the morning of the 22nd. After the meeting, all personnel of the District Committee agencies gathered to formulate an epidemic prevention plan. Currently, epidemic prevention work in various agencies stationed in the special district has been widely launched.
