What We Saw and Learned?
    Communication from the Beijing Dalian Industrial Exhibition Visiting Group
    Wang Jing
    Dalian (Lüshun), which has been liberated for four years, under the help of the great international friend – the Soviet Union, and under the correct leadership of the Dalian District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the working class has generally improved its consciousness and exerted great creative power. Lüda has been turned from a colony under Japanese imperialist oppression into one of the industrial bases of the new democratic New China.
    On October 9th, our Beijing visiting group of 44 people arrived in Dalian by train and began to visit the industrial exhibition on the 11th. The first day was a general overview, and from the second day onwards, we visited in groups according to our individual specialties and needs, focusing on learning.
    1. How did the industry in Dalian develop?
    Some people say that the industrial exhibition is a microcosm of the industrial achievements of the Dalian area, and that is absolutely true. Just talking about the exhibition venue, seven months ago, it was still a dilapidated ruin, but now it is a magnificent and splendid modern building. Four years ago, the Japanese invaders left behind incomplete and even dilapidated industrial equipment. In the past four years, the working class of Dalian, with the help of the Soviet army and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, overcame all kinds of difficulties in the road to restoring production with the most heroic posture, and finally rebuilt and developed the industry of Dalian. Aren't the exhibits in the seventeen exhibition halls in front of us their remarkable achievements? In the machinery, shipbuilding, chemical, railway and other pavilions, the young worker comrades (guides) enthusiastically and patiently explained the structure of the machines and the principles of the materials to us in detail. They not only understand technology, but also understand theory. How did this achievement come about? The answer can be found in their conversations. They said: "When the Japanese invaders were here, not to mention that the technicians were Japanese, they wouldn't even let the Chinese see the drawings. Chinese people couldn't even ask about technical problems, and they were just doing things blindly all day long. But after liberation, the Soviet elder brothers helped us with construction, and we finally got the hang of it! If we didn't understand or couldn't do something, the elder brothers taught us desperately and didn't mind at all. They also encouraged us to create and improve machines ourselves. Look! This is the machine washing machine created by Li Desheng of the rolling stock plant of the China Changchun Railway. This is the method of converting the bed surface by Luo Yuanshun of Guanghe Machinery Factory. This is…" The industry of Dalian has developed in this way. It is the crystallization of the hard work of the workers in Dalian and the advanced technology of the Soviet Union. It shows the strength of the Chinese workers after liberation, and even more represents the great love of the Soviet comrades. This industrial exhibition, a grand review of the strength of the New China workers, is a great satire and blow to those enemies who say that we "can't do this or that, and won't manage cities".
    2. New Enlightenment of Relying on the Working Class
    From the various charts in the industrial exhibition, we have a deeper understanding of the policy put forward by the Dalian District Committee of the CPC: "Develop production, improve people's livelihood, develop culture, and train cadres."
    In the Cultural and Education Museum, we saw Dalian's two-year plan to eliminate illiteracy. We can determine that the realization of this plan is beyond doubt by first looking at the development figures in the past. For example, the literacy campaign: only 78,907 people participated in 1946, but in 1949, it had reached 201,173 people. The number of workers participating in spare-time learning in 1946 was 7,736 (including cultural, political, and technical learning), and in 1949 it had reached 117,716. In 1947, there were 67,908 students in primary and secondary schools, and in 1949 there were already 155,971.
    The large-scale training and promotion of worker cadres is a characteristic of Dalian. In the past four years, 5,799 male and female cadres have been trained. Seeing this figure, our "reliance on the working class" has become clearer.
    After visiting the Friendship Museum, many people said, "Without the Soviet Red Army, there would be no Dalian." Indeed, as long as they are not deliberately using colored glasses, after seeing the photos of the Red Army defending Dalian and helping Dalian's construction, and the facts and figures of helping us in culture and agriculture (such as selling horses to farmers at low prices, and giving Dalian more than one million US books in the past three years...), they will sincerely admire the great friendship of the Soviet friends from the bottom of their hearts.
    3. What did we learn?
    During the three days of visiting the industrial exhibition, we learned a lot. We have a rough understanding of Dalian's industry. It made us feel fresh things and new problems. We saw many industrial raw materials and equipment that Beijing could not manufacture, such as 66-90 degree sulfuric acid, potassium chlorate, phosphorus sulfide, large red pigments, acid-resistant steel, acid-resistant bricks, carbon crucible, electrodes, transformer oil, insulating materials, as well as springs, fishplates, splint screws, and other parts for trams. Many of them were always thought by Beijing people to be imported from the United States. Now, seeing that Dalian can manufacture them, many people are very happy and said: "Believe in your own strength! With the help of Soviet comrades, New China will definitely be able to be self-reliant." It has also solved many technical problems for us, such as the water supply equipment. The Beijing Water Supply Company often considers the problems of small water volume, deep water layer, complex terrain, and long water distribution, so it hesitates when setting up new water channels. However, Dalian's geographical conditions are far inferior to Beijing's in terms of setting up water channels, but tap water is supplied to the entire city. So, Xu Jilin of the Beijing Water Supply Company excitedly said: "What reason do we have to stop in the face of difficulties?" At the same time, Beijing did not dare to use cast iron pipes for 75 cm water pipes, while Dalian used cast iron pipes for 1 meter water pipes, which also gave us a great inspiration (Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant can produce a large number of iron pipes). This proves that technology should not stick to old rules, but must be boldly created.

　　我们看到和学到了什么？　
    北京旅大工展参观团通讯
    王敬
    解放了四年的旅（顺）大（连），在伟大的国际友邦——苏联的帮助下，在中国共产党旅大区党委的正确领导下，工人阶级觉悟程度普遍提高，发挥了伟大的创造力量，已经把旅大从一个日本帝国主义压迫下的殖民地翻转过来，一变而为新民主主义新中国的工业基地之一了。
    十月九日，我们——北京参观团一行四十四人乘坐火车抵达大连，十一日开始参观工展。第一天是浏览全貌，第二天起按个人的专长和需要分组参观，重点学习。
    一、旅大工业是怎样发展起来的？
    有人说工展是旅大地区工业成果的缩影，这话一点也不差，单就展览会场来讲，在七个月以前，它还是一片残破的废墟，而现在却是辉煌灿烂、宏伟、壮丽的近代化建筑了。四年前，日寇留下的是残缺不全以至破破烂烂的工业设备。四年中，旅大的工人阶级，在苏军帮助和中国共产党的领导下，以最英勇的姿态，战胜了恢复生产前进道路上的种种困难，终于把旅大工业重建和发展起来了。这次摆在我们面前的十七个陈列馆里展览品，不正是他们的赫赫战果吗？在机械、造船、化学、铁道等馆里，年青的工人同志们（说明员）热诚而耐心的把机器的构造、物质的原理，很详细的讲给我们听。他们不仅懂得技术，而且也懂得理论了。这个成绩是怎样来的呢？从他们的谈话里可以找出答案来，他们说：“日寇在这里时，不要说技术人员是日本人，连画图也不肯让中国人看见，中国人想问问关于技术上的问题都不行，只是整天装在闷葫芦罐里死做。可是解放后，苏联老大哥们帮咱们建设，可就开了窍了！不懂得的，不会的，老大哥们拚命的教，一点也不嫌麻烦，还奖励咱们自己创造和改良机器，你看看！这是中长铁路对车厂李德声创造的洗机车。这是广和机械厂罗元顺改造的倒床面方法。这是……”旅大的工业，就是这样发展起来的。它是旅大工人兄弟的辛勤劳动和苏联先进技术的结晶。它显示着解放后中国工人的力量，更代表着苏联同志伟大的友爱，这个新中国工人力量大检阅的工业展览，给那些说我们“这也不行那也不行，不会管理城市”的敌人们一个极大的讽刺和打击。
    二、依靠工人阶级的新启示
    从工展的各种图表里，使我们更深的体会到中共旅大区党委所提出的：“发展生产，改善民生，发展文化，培养干部”的方针。
    在文教馆里，看到了旅大两年消灭文盲的计划。我们先从过去发展的数字上看，就可以断定这计划的实现是绝无疑义的。如识字运动：一九四六年仅七万八千九百零七人参加，到一九四九年已达二十万零一千一百七十三人。参加业余学习的工人一九四六年共七千七百三十六人（包括文化、政治、技术学习），到一九四九年已达十一万七千七百十六人。大、中、小学教育一九四七年共有学生六万七千九百零八人，到一九四九年已经有十五万五千九百七十一人了。
    大批培养和提拔工人干部，是旅大的特点，四年来，培养男女干部已达五千七百九十九人。看到了这个数字，使我们“依靠工人阶级”的思想更明确了。
    参观了友谊馆，许多人都说：“没有苏联红军，就没有旅大。”的确，只要不是别具用心、带了有色眼镜的人，看了这些红军保卫旅大，帮助旅大建设的照片，和在文化上、农业上帮助我们的事实和数字（如廉价卖给农民马匹、三年来给旅大的百余万美册书籍……），都会从心底里发出对苏联友人伟大友谊的衷心感佩。
    三、我们学到了什么？
    三天的工展参观，我们学习了很多东西，对大连工业，有了一个粗略的认识，它使我们感触到了新鲜的事物，新鲜的问题。我们看到了许多北京所不能制造的工业原料和器材，如六六度至九十度硫酸、氯酸钾、硫化磷、大红颜料、耐酸钢、耐酸砖、炭精坩锅、电极、变压器油、绝缘材料，以及电车用的弹簧、鱼尾板、夹板螺丝，和其他机件等。其中许多是北京人一向以为非由美国运来不可的。现在，看见大连能制造了，许多人都非常高兴的说：“相信自己的力量吧！在苏联同志的帮助下，新中国绝对能够自力更生的。”在技术上也给我们解决了许多问题，如水道的设备，北京自来水公司常常考虑到水量小、水层深、地形复杂、配水道远等问题，因而在设新水道时便犹疑不决，而大连的地理条件，在设水道上讲是远不如北京的，但自来水都供给全市。于是我们北京自来水公司的徐继林兴奋地说：“我们还有什么道理停留在困难面前呢？”同时，北京七十五公分的水管不敢用生铁管，而大连一公尺的水管都用生铁管，这也给我们一个很大的启示（石景山钢铁厂是能大量产生铁管的）。这证明，技术是不应墨守旧章的，必须要大胆的创造。
