　　Ministry of Railways National Locomotive Depot and Factory Maintenance Joint Conference Opens
　　Discussing Next Year's Production Tasks
　　Minister Teng proposed to complete: 22,000 kilometers of open railway, locomotives traveling 439 kilometers per day, and a turnaround rate of four days.
　　[Beijing News] The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government National Locomotive Depot and Factory Maintenance Joint Conference opened in the capital yesterday (the 24th). The meeting is scheduled for three days. The main content of the meeting is to formulate the November maintenance plan, discuss the production tasks for 1950, study the maintenance acceptance system, locomotive quality standards, and strengthen the cooperation between locomotive depot work and factory work.
　　The conference began at 8:00 AM on the 24th, with 155 attendees including the chiefs of locomotive departments of the Northeast, North, and South Railway Administrations, the directors of various railway factories, the chief of the locomotive department of the Northeast General Bureau, Soviet railway experts, and representatives of the Locomotive Depot and Factory Bureau. After Deputy Director Zhou Xiaping of the Locomotive Bureau announced the opening of the meeting, Minister Teng delivered an important speech, followed by work reports from Director Ma Jun of the Locomotive Bureau and Deputy Director Li Menghou of the Factory Bureau. In the afternoon, Soviet experts introduced the experience of Soviet locomotive depot work. Bai Tieyan, Chief of the Factory Department of the Northeast General Bureau, Wang Li, Chief of the Locomotive Department of the Harbin Railway Bureau, and Shi Yuyong, Director of the Shenyang Huangguantun Railway Factory, gave work reports.
　　In his speech, Minister Teng first analyzed the current victorious situation, pointing out that national economic construction has already begun, and locomotive depot and factory work play a significant role in completing transportation tasks. He proposed the railway transportation tasks for 1950: "The operating mileage should reach 22,000 kilometers. Restore 50 locomotive depots, 8 inspection car depots, and 27 water supply stations. The locomotive mileage should reach 439.620 kilometers per day. The national number of loaded cars should reach 9,400 to 10,000, and the turnaround rate should reach four days." In order to complete this major task, Minister Teng explained: "We cannot completely rely on national investment and supply; we must rely on the railway itself, and achieve the goals of reducing costs, reducing the national burden, and completing tasks by strengthening work, improving quality, and improving efficiency." He then pointed out: "In terms of locomotive maintenance, there are still shortcomings such as generally low locomotive quality, production capacity not matching tasks, and insufficient utilization of surplus production capacity. In the future, we should attach importance to planning work, conduct precise and in-depth research and analysis of production capacity, effectively organize and utilize it, and formulate a practical November maintenance plan to lay the foundation for the 1950 plan." Finally, he hoped that all attending representatives would "thoroughly implement the responsibility system in locomotive depot and factory work and sincerely and honestly learn from the advanced construction experience of the Soviet Union."

　　　　Learn from Soviet Experience, Implement Responsibility System; Northeast Locomotives' Class A Inspections Exceed 100,000 Kilometers
　　Following this, Director Ma Jun of the Locomotive Bureau gave a work report, introducing the development of locomotive depot work from January to September 1949. The mileage of Class A inspections has generally increased, and in the Northeast, many locomotives have exceeded 100,000 kilometers. These achievements are mainly due to learning from Soviet experience and implementing the responsibility system. He pointed out the serious shortcomings currently existing in locomotive depot work: many locomotive accidents, reaching 11.2 percent per 100,000 kilometers; the waste of maintenance capacity reaching 36 percent; the temporary repair rate at 15 percent; 90 percent of locomotives with imperfect insulation devices; and serious problems with water rust and steam leakage in the steam chambers and cylinders affecting the current quality of locomotives. The above shortcomings are due to: (1) Insufficient understanding of the planning nature of the work, taking the plan too simply, limiting the planning work only to the arrangement of numerical tasks, and lacking serious consideration of the guaranteed conditions for completing the tasks, the quality of the machines, the supply of tools and spare parts, and the possibility of further developing production capacity. Furthermore, no concrete analysis and research is conducted on the actual state of the locomotives, the efficiency of machine operation, the exertion of labor, and the mutual coordination of production capacity. When formulating the plan, the steps of bottom-up approach are not adopted, and the plan is not combined with practical mass activities, but the plan is turned into a plan on paper. There is arrangement but no inspection, and the plan becomes a summary reference material, but does not become a guideline for guiding work. (2) Insufficient implementation of the responsibility system. It has been clearly stipulated at the National Locomotive Depot Conference, but it has not reached the required level in the past few months. The contract repair system and contract locomotive system have not been universally established. In particular, the key issue of improving technology in the implementation of the responsibility system still lacks serious attention in actual work. There are still many machines, vehicles under temporary management, damaged vehicles, and material spare parts for which no one is responsible. (3) We still lack a business perspective, and special attention must be paid to correcting this problem.
　　In his work report, Deputy Director Li of the Factory Bureau introduced the general situation of railway factories across the country. There are a total of 26 large and small factories nationwide, with 37,000 employees. In terms of estimating factory capacity, most factory machines have been in use for 30 to 40 years. However, according to the production statistics of the past two months, the production capacity is only about 70 percent. The main shortcomings in factories across the country are unsound management methods, insufficient organization and planning, waste of human and material resources, lack of strict economic accounting and technical standards, and the widespread phenomenon of rework of locomotives and finished products. He proposed the factory work tasks for 1950: overhauling 1,513 locomotives, 3,005 passenger cars, and 12,467 freight cars; producing 5,347 pairs of locomotive wheels, 43,300 pairs of passenger and freight car wheels; and supplying 250,373 pieces of spare parts for locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars to various sections across the country, as well as 588 sets of mechanical equipment to various sections. This heavy task will be studied on how to complete it based on the specific November plan.
　　The meeting continued at 1:30 PM, beginning with Soviet experts introducing the organization of Soviet locomotive depot work and various locomotive systems. They proposed: (1) Implementing the crew responsibility system so that crew members can cherish locomotives. (2) Establishing the importance of the wheel regular inspection system. (3) The importance and experience of locomotive boiler inspection and repair. (4) Improving the technical level of crew members. (5) Boiler cleaning work and daily testing of boiler water. (6) Excellent and advanced technical experience such as using electric welding methods to weld furnace stays.

　　铁道部全国机务厂务检修联席会议揭幕
  　讨论明年生产任务
    滕部长提出要完成：通车二万二千公里，机车每天行走四百三十九公里，周转率达到四天。
    【北京讯】中央人民政府铁道部全国机务厂务检修联席会议，已于昨（二十四）日在首都揭幕。会期预定三天。会议的主要内容是制订十一月份检修计划，讨论一九五○年生产任务，研究检修验收员制度，机车质量标准及加强机务工作与厂务工作的配合等问题。
    大会于二十四日上午八时开始，出席东北、北方、南方各铁路管理局机务处长、各铁路工厂厂长、东北总局机务部长及苏联铁路专家、机务厂务局代表等共一五五人。机务局副局长周侠平宣布开会后，滕部长发表重要谈话，接着机务局马钧局长及厂务局李梦吼副局长作工作报告，下午苏联专家介绍苏联机务工作的经验。东北总局厂务部部长白铁岩、哈尔滨路局机务处处长王立及沈阳皇姑屯铁路工厂厂长石玉永作工作报告。
    滕部长在谈话中，首先分析目前胜利形势，指出全国经济建设业已展开，机务与厂务工作在完成运输任务上，起着重大的作用。提出一九五○年的铁路运输任务：“通车里程达到二万二千公里。恢复五十个机务段，八个检车段和二十七个给水所，机车公里达到每天四三九·六二○公里。全国装车数字达到九四○○至一○○○○辆，周转率达到四天。”为完成这一重大任务，滕部长说明：“我们不能完全依靠国家的投资和补给，必须依靠铁路本身，从工作的加强，质量的提高和效率的提高上，达到减低成本，减少国家负担，完成任务的目的。”继指出：“在机车检修方面，目前还存在着机车质量普遍不高，生产能力与任务不适应及生产能力剩余的利用不足等缺点。今后应当重视计划工作，对生产能力进行精密的、深刻的研究和分析，有效的组织和利用，作出切合实际的十一月份检修计划，以打下一九五○年计划的基础。”最后希望全体出席代表“彻底贯彻机务与厂务方面的负责制，诚心诚意老老实实学习苏联的先进建设经验。”
    　　　　学习苏联经验贯彻负责制　东北机车甲检超过十万公里
    接着由机务局马钧局长作工作报告，介绍一九四九年一月至九月机务工作发展情况，甲检公里已普遍提高，在东北方面有很多机车超过十万公里。这些成绩主要是学习了苏联经验和贯彻负责制所收到的成果。指出目前机务工作中存在着的严重缺点：机车事故很多，每十万公里中达到百分之十一点二；检修能力的浪费达到百分之三十六；临时修车率有百分之十五；机车保温装置不完善的有百分之九十；机车水锈及汽室汽筒漏泄也是影响当前机车质量上的严重现象。以上缺点是由于：（一）我们对于工作的计划性认识不够，把计划看的太简单，计划工作仅仅局限在数字任务的布置上，而完成任务的保证条件，机器的质量，工具备品的供应，以及进一步发展生产能力的可能性等缺乏认真的考虑。而对于实际的机车状态，机器的运用效率，劳动力的发挥，以及生产能力互相配合等，不进行具体分析研究。在制定计划时，不是采取由下而上的步骤，不是把计划和实际群众活动相结合起来，而是把计划变成了纸上的一种计划。有布置没有检查，把计划成了总结参考资料，而没有成为指导工作的行动的方针。（二）贯彻负责制不够，在全国机务会议上已明确规定，这几个月以来还没有达到应有的要求，包修制和包车制还没有普遍建立起来，特别是执行负责制问题上一个关键提高技术问题，在实际工作中还缺乏认真注意。现在还有许多机器、代管车、破损车及材料备品还存在无人负责现象。（三）我们还缺乏企业观点，在这个问题必须特别注意纠正。
    厂务局李副局长在工作报告中，介绍全国铁路工厂概况，全国大小工厂共有二十六个，职工三万七千人，在工厂能力的估计上，各厂机器使用年龄，多已满三四十年，但根据以往二个月的生产统计推算，生产能力仅发挥出百分之七十左右。在全国各厂现存缺点方面，主要的是管理方法不健全，组织性计划性不够，浪费人力物力，缺乏严格的经济核算，和技术标准，普遍的存在着机车及成品的反工现象。提出一九五○年厂务工作的任务，大中修机车一、五一三台，客车三○○五辆，货车一二、四六七辆，机车车轮五、三四七对，客货车车辆四三、三○○对，并供应全国各段机客、货车配件二五○、三七三件，及各段机械设备五八八台。这一繁重任务，将根据订出的十一月份具体计划，研究如何完成。
    下午一时半继续开会，首由苏联专家介绍苏联机务工作的组织，与机车各种制度。提出：（一）贯彻乘务负责制，使乘务员能爱惜机车。（二）建立外轮定检制的重要。（三）机车汽锅检查修理的重要及经验。（四）提高乘务员技术水平。（五）锅炉清洗工作及锅炉用水每天要化验。（六）炉撑使用电焊方法焊接等优秀先进的技术经验。
